Running motor vehicle trains is no longer a mystery; it is being vigorously promoted in provinces and cities across the country. But can it be done on the plateau? Some onlookers put on airs and try to scare people: First, the mountain slopes are too steep, and the horsepower isn't strong enough, especially the Erlang Mountain, which is famous throughout the country. Second, the bends are too sharp, and the steering isn't sensitive enough. It's too risky to drag trailers, and it probably won't work. Third, the climate is bad, with snow and ice. At an altitude of over five thousand meters, it's hard to even breathe. Fourth, the vehicles are old and have problems everywhere. They don't have enough power to go uphill, and the brakes don't work well downhill. In short, don't be too rash. Who will take responsibility if something goes wrong? The No. 1 Motor Vehicle Team of Ya'an boldly broke superstitions and decided to welcome the Party's birthday by having the branch make a decision: first, haul the train with five tons of goods to Chengdu, then to Shimian, making a round trip without any difficulty. When the good news spread, everyone was happy and expressed their determination to the Party to resolutely reach Kangding. On July 15th, the train went into action, and the deputy secretary of the Party committee personally led the team. They stayed in Xingou that night, and everything went smoothly. As soon as the vehicles stopped, everyone inquired: Is the turning sensitive? Is the horsepower enough for the uphill? A driver commented from the side: Tomorrow's Erlang Mountain is sure to fail. And there's also the Wasigou; it's hard enough to go without towing. You'll have to unload the goods to get to Kangding. We don't believe in Erlang Mountain and are determined to compete with it and make it surrender. The heroes were highly motivated and finally broke the superstitions, successfully crossing the mountain and safely reaching Luding. When the train arrived in Luding City, that person still didn't believe it: Compete in Wasigou, and I'll believe it when you get up there. After leaving Wasigou, the vehicle had a problem and stalled on a steep slope. After carefully searching for the cause, it was found that the oil was low and the vehicle didn't have enough power. After changing the oil inlet, they instantly arrived in Kangding. After crossing Erlang Mountain, there was still a superstition: Could they also leap over the Zheduo Mountain ahead? Speaking of Zheduo Mountain, the slope is long and not simple, thirty-two kilometers, rising more than four thousand meters above sea level. Should they continue forward? Or return to Ya'an? After studying, everyone decided to break through this barrier. The secretary instructed them not to be complacent. The heroes were brave and determined to break through the sky. After loading the goods onto the trailer, they set off for Daofu, believing that an iron rod can be made into a needle, and river water can be brought up the mountain. Many drivers were sweating behind their backs, shaking their heads and saying: It's like a boat sailing through a rocky bay! As expected, it was steep and dangerous. They shifted gears one after another, stepping on the gas pedal. Seeing that they were almost at the top, they encountered a steep threshold. The horsepower was exhausted, and they had to make a sharp turn. Seeing that they couldn't get up, the vehicle suddenly stopped. It turned out that the water tank was open, so they took a break to add water. Everyone looked for the problem, the high mountain reduced the horsepower, and the ignition should be advanced, revealing the secret. The big mountains surrendered, and the small mountains were even simpler. The steep slopes raised their hands, and Daofu was on the other side. When the vehicles arrived in Daofu, the Tibetan compatriots came to watch, all saying it was an iron yak, and even bringing their children! This time they tow one, next time they'll tow a string of them. The plateau mini-trains are getting better and better.
    It is truly said: High mountains bow their heads to let the trains pass, one day is equal to twenty years; laughable are the onlookers who only count the costs, not knowing that man can conquer nature!

    康藏高原跑列车
    雅安汽车一队队长　刘廷黔汽车列车化，已经不神秘，全国各省市，大力在推行。可是在高原，是否也得行？有些观潮派，装腔来吓人：第一山坡大，马力不够劲，特别二郎山，全国都有名；第二弯道急，转向不灵敏，拖车去冒险，恐怕不得行；第三气候坏，积雪又结冰，海拔五千几，气都出不赢；第四车况老，到处有毛病，上坡没力量，下坡刹不停；总之一句话，不要太冒进，万一出了事，后果谁担承？雅安汽一队，大胆破迷信，迎接党生日，支部作决定：先拉到成都，列车拖五吨，然后到石棉，往返不费劲。喜讯一传开，大家都高兴，向党表决心，坚决到康定。七月十五日，列车上了阵，党委副书记，亲自把兵领。当晚住新沟，一路很风顺。车子刚一停，大家来打听：转弯灵不灵？上坡可够劲？有个驾驶员，一旁来品评：明日二郎山，失败是肯定；还有瓦斯沟，不拖都费劲，你们要下货，才能到康定。什么二郎山，我们不相信，决心去比武，叫它来归顺。英雄干劲大，终于破迷信，顺利翻过山，安全到泸定。车到泸定城，那人还不信：较量瓦斯沟，上去我才信。瓦斯沟出去，车子出毛病，正在陡坡上，熄火不前进。仔细找原因，油少车没劲，换个灌油眼，霎时到康定。二郎山跃过，还有一迷信：前面折多山，能否再跃进？提起折多山，坡长不简单，三十二公里，拔海超四千。继续往前进？还是回雅安？大家一研究，决定破此关。书记作指示，千万勿自满，英雄胆儿大，志气冲破天。拖车装好货，道孚走一番，铁棒能成针，河水能上山。许多驾驶员，背后捏把汗，都在摆脑壳：船行乱石湾！果然不虚传，硬是陡又险，一档接连换，油门快登翻。看看快到顶，遇着陡门坎，马力已用尽，又要转急弯。眼看上不去，车子猛一站，原来水箱开，休息把水掺。大家找毛病，山高马力减，火头应提快，秘密被揭穿。大山都投降，小山更简单，陡坡举双手，道孚在那边，车子到道孚，藏胞齐来看，都说铁牦牛，还把娃娃牵！这次拖一个，下次拖一串，高原小火车，好的在后边。
    正是：高山低头让列车，一天等于二十年；堪笑观潮算账派，那知人定能胜天！
