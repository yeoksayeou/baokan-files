    A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire
    Guo Moruo
    To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the August 1st Army Day, the Editorial Committee for the 30 Years of征文 (essay collection) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will compile a magnificent epic of the Chinese Revolution, tentatively titled "The Glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army." This book will be divided into four volumes according to the chronological order of the 征文 content: the first volume is the Land Revolution War period, the second volume is the Anti-Japanese War period, the third volume is the Liberation War period, and the fourth volume is the period after the national victory. Each volume will be divided into several collections. This is a great satellite launched by the great leap forward in editing plans. It will pass on the glory of the Party, which leads the Chinese revolution and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, forever.
    The first collection of the first volume, "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," is divided into two volumes. I read it once before it was printed in lead type, and it is not at all false to say that I "galloped through it." But this "galloping" was not due to my subjective carelessness, but because the objective "flowers" forced me to ride a thousand-mile horse and run like crazy. The words and stories are too attractive. After reading the previous section, you are forced to rush to read the next section. After reading the previous chapter, you are forced to rush to read the next chapter. After reading the first volume, you are forced to rush to read the second volume. Therefore, I am not only "galloping," but also flying through the stars on a rocket. My urgent expectation now is: to compile the second collection as soon as possible, and even the entire four volumes.
    The writers range from marshals to retired soldiers, which specifically demonstrates the equality of officers and soldiers. They all write about their personal experiences in the revolutionary struggle, the most difficult situations, the most thrilling encounters, the most tortuous processes, and the most unexpected scenes, with victories, failures, deep sorrow, and enthusiastic cheers, all recorded from their unforgettable memories. Real people, real events, real guns, and real knives are more attractive than any fictional literary work. This is a collective creation that lives up to its name, a necklace of real pearls—no, a Great Wall made of rubies!
    Yes, a string or a strip. Although it is a collection of essays, the writers do not conspire with each other. You write yours, I write mine, the land is divided east, west, north, and south, and the calendar spans thirty years. However, it is by no means a plate of miscellaneous things or a piece of loose sand. Because, here, the backbone has the consistent connection of revolutionary struggle, the characters have the first-class style of communists, and even the use of the pen has accurate, clear, and vivid colors. This is such unity, a summary of countless crystal molecules with the same shape. Of course, now we have only seen "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," but we have already seen the beginning of a system. The sandalwood is fragrant from the very beginning, when it is just a seedling with two cotyledons. With the development of history, no matter how tortuous, advancing or retreating, obstructed or overcoming difficulties, it is like drawing a thick red line with arrows on a map, always connected and constantly progressing.
    What is this thick red line? That is the leadership of the Party, that is, the gradual and close integration of the great truth of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of China, and the correct leadership of Mao Zedong Thought for the Chinese revolution, especially his military thought. The Chinese revolution is a revolution of the worker-peasant alliance led by the proletariat, and is a struggle of the revolutionary armed forces of the worker-peasant alliance against the counter-revolutionary armed forces. This revolutionary struggle gradually formed a situation in which the revolutionary countryside surrounded the counter-revolutionary cities, and finally made a large area of ​​deep red eliminate the large and small scattered white dots, turning the entire China into a large red flag. Thirty years of history cannot be considered too short, but from this "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire" we can already see the seeds of revolutionary victory. Although it is only a "single spark," it already has the momentum to "start a prairie fire."
    This is certainly a very good historical material for the revolution. People who study modern history can dig out infinitely rich mines from here. It is even more a revolutionary textbook for conducting patriotic and internationalist education. Every Chinese citizen, especially young people, must read it and train themselves from this wave of overlapping revolutionary historical facts. The older generation went through so much difficult torment, shed so much blood, and sacrificed so many precious lives to make the revolutionary cause victorious! Today, we are enjoying the fruits of revolutionary victory, and we cannot help but remember the source when drinking water, and even more we must do our best to consolidate our revolutionary victory and expand our revolutionary victory.
    Today and in the future, the kind of extraordinarily unimaginable hardship and pain that existed in the era of the founding of the revolutionary cause may no longer exist for us. The counter-revolution on the mainland has basically been eliminated; in the continuous revolutionary education, there is no doubt that people are "going all out, aiming high." However, our territory of Taiwan is still occupied by US imperialism, and the eight million Chinese compatriots on Taiwan Island are still suffering in dire straits. Moreover, the aggressive group headed by US imperialism is still blockading us, and has openly declared that it wants to subvert our people's regime. The memorandum recently announced by the US government, which does not recognize the People's Republic of China, blatantly states that our regime "will disappear one day." The warmongers of the United States, such as Dulles, are not only uttering such absurd fallacies, but are also engaging in absurd adventures. We know that imperialism is making a death struggle; but before it dies and while it is still struggling, we must be vigilant and guard against the unexpected disasters that may be caused by a cornered dog jumping over the wall.
    Imperialism is the source of war, and as long as imperialism exists, there is no absolute guarantee of lasting world peace. At present, not only are the compatriots on Taiwan Island still trampled under the iron hooves of imperialism, but also many unliberated nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also suffering under the iron hooves of imperialism. These unliberated nations are embracing infinite aspirations for the victory of our Chinese people's revolution, and they hope to be able to learn from our experience and follow in our footsteps in order to achieve comprehensive liberation. In recent years, the movements of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to fight for national independence and resist colonialism are surging, and they are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the imperialists. We Chinese people, based on our own personal experience, harbor infinite sympathy for this just struggle. No one is willing to stand by and watch, and therefore, we feel even more necessary: to be mentally prepared at all times!
    If we want to safeguard peace, we must eliminate the source of war. If we want to eliminate the source of war, we must have the power to overwhelm the forces of war. If warmongers launch a war, they must be dealt a head-on blow and thoroughly defeated. From this, we can deeply realize that our Chinese People's Liberation Army is not only a strong defender of the security of the motherland, but also a strong defender of world peace. We must not only love him and strengthen him, but also learn from him! Every one of our unarmed comrades should learn from the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and train themselves into steel warriors to fight in various posts, and when necessary, to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the imperialist aggressors. There are certainly various ways to carry out this kind of mental preparation, but I think that taking time out to read this revolutionary textbook, "The Glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army," is also a very good method.
    I have a few preliminary suggestions here.
    First of all, I have two opposite but parallel requirements for the editorial committee: one is to collect as much as possible, and the other is to select as carefully as possible. These two tasks must be carried out simultaneously. Collecting as much as possible is a request not to choose materials too strictly. Such valuable historical materials are as many as possible. We should not care about the quality of the writing, and we must record everything. Of course, we can make necessary embellishments to the text. In short, the more materials, the better.
    Selecting as carefully as possible is a request to select the most educational and well-written texts from each collection and compile them into selected works, so that the broad masses, especially young people, can buy, read, and have a copy as a textbook for educating themselves. After all four volumes are compiled in the future, we don't know how many books there will be, which will inevitably be a vast literature. Ordinary comrades cannot afford to buy it, and it is even more difficult to find the time to read it all. Therefore, while editing and publishing the complete book, it is really necessary to compile a selection. This work is not that troublesome. The selection can be named differently, for example, following the example of "Liberation Army Literature," it seems appropriate to call it "Liberation Army Reader."
    Secondly, while editing and publishing the Chinese version, we should consider the issue of translation, translating it into the languages ​​of domestic fraternal ethnic groups or foreign languages. For foreign language translations, Russian, English, French, and Spanish are indispensable. With the translated versions, the spread of revolutionary struggle experience, especially the spread of Chairman Mao's military thought, will be more extensive. As mentioned above, the people of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are embracing infinite aspirations for our revolution. Our extremely rich experience in anti-colonialism and anti-feudalism struggle can be a good reference for them; and they are also very willing to accept and understand it. In order to promote the worldwide struggle against colonialism and for national independence, it is absolutely necessary to spread the Chinese experience in foreign languages. This is a big project. If it is difficult to translate the entire book at once, the translation of the selection mentioned above, the "Liberation Army Reader," should be easier to carry out. In this way, it will not only provide valuable historical materials for modern world history, but also add many priceless treasures to the world's literary treasury.
    Thirdly, I want to make a special suggestion to comrades engaged in literary and artistic work. Of course, we should also learn from the spirit of revolutionary martyrs and steel soldiers to forge ourselves, but from the perspective of literary and artistic work, each of us should collect materials from this revolutionary epic, refine, synthesize, and develop them, and crystallize them into diverse, vivid, and colorful masterpieces. Many stories here can be developed into novels, dramas, and storytelling; they can be expressed as sculptures, paintings, and movies; even music, dance, and architecture will get many majestic motifs from here. Let me give an example. For example, "In Shilon County" collected by the Guangzhou Military Region's contribution group is a story that can be greatly developed.
    This is a story about the Qiongya Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The Red Army was attacked by the Kuomintang reactionary troops and was scattered, and the people suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. The Red Army Hospital, located at the foot of the Liulian Ridge at the junction of Lehui and Wanning counties, also had to evacuate the wounded. The remaining seventy seriously wounded soldiers who could not move were moved by the military medical director Wang Shaohua and two nurses to a mountain depression under a peak. The mountain depression looked a bit like a sleeping dragon, so they named it "Shilon County."
    There were no houses. They found some branches and banana leaves to build thatched huts. The furniture consisted of only three tweezers, a bucket, and a few pieces of broken cookware. There was no medicine, so they could only use tree leaves dipped in water to wash the wounds. The food they brought was quickly eaten. In order to find food and treat the wounded, Director Wang Shaohua took great pains under the enemy's strict blockade. He persevered in suffering for three months, not only solving the food problem, but also finally curing the wounded with native methods. Seventy soldiers rushed to all corners of Hainan Island.
    The story deliberately writes about Wang Shaohua's responsible attitude and class friendship. Some places are very touching. For example, the first time he sneaked past the enemy's blockade line in the dark to borrow food from the common people. He sneaked into a small house and found an old mother who was "almost skin and bones." The old mother was extremely happy when she saw the Red Army. She took out a small jar from the head of the bed and scooped rice for him. When she scooped the third bowl, she heard the sound of the bowl hitting the bottom of the jar. Wang Shaohua couldn't bear it, so he poured the last half bowl of rice back into the jar. What a touching scene!
    After that, Wang Shaohua repeatedly risked going to borrow food, and the villagers gave as much as they had, some giving half a sheng or one sheng, and some giving half a bowl or one bowl. With the support of the villagers, the lives of these seventy-odd people were able to be maintained for three months.
    Wang Shaohua also tried his best to fulfill his responsibility in medical treatment. He used internal antipyretic herbs to apply to the wounds and actually cured the suppurating wounds. He also kept asking the villagers for advice, using various herbs, and also using ordinary needles and threads to perform surgery. He finally cured all the wounded.
    The short narrative uses considerable effort to write about Director Wang Shaohua, but it is still too simple. The activities and psychological states of other comrades besides Director Wang are even less written about. A lot can be done on the two nurses. A lot can be done on the wounded soldiers who "know the difficulties of the leadership and do not say a word" and "would rather starve to death than let the director take risks," and the villagers who borrowed food and taught native methods of treating injuries. Especially about the "old mother who is almost skin and bones," a lot can be done on the article. I believe that she did a series of work for Director Wang. Relying on her activities to contact the villagers, there was a continuous donation of half a sheng or one sheng, half a bowl or one bowl of rice, and a continuous transmission of various native methods of treating injuries. A lot can be written about the urgency of the enemy's situation, the arrangement of actions, and the guidance of routes. Otherwise, how could seventy-odd soldiers safely evacuate after three months?
    I am just giving a simple example. There are plenty of such examples in the whole book. If literary and artistic workers come into contact with inspiration, they can use their efforts to expand the story. Of course, further preparations are needed here. For example, in the example of "In Shilon County" mentioned above, if the writers want to develop it, they need to go to Qiongya to take a look. The villagers are still there, and the wounded, doctors, and nurses may still be there—at least there are still people there. Writers need to try their best to inquire about the situation at that time from these people and add flesh and blood to the story. Even if some reasonable imaginative components are added, I think it is permissible. No matter how detailed the investigation is, the full picture of the facts cannot be completely and perfectly investigated and understood. Typical characters in a typical environment can be created in a comprehensive way. If literary and artistic workers are willing to adopt such a method, I believe that on the literary and artistic front, the "single spark" of this book will once again cause a "prairie fire" phenomenon.

    燎原的星火
    郭沫若
    为了庆祝八一建军节三十周年纪念，中国人民解放军三十年征文编辑委员会将编辑一部雄伟的中国革命史诗，定名为“光荣的中国人民解放军”。这书要按征文内容的年代分编为四卷：第一卷是土地革命战争时期，第二卷是抗日战争时期，第三卷是解放战争时期，第四卷是全国胜利以后的时期。每卷将分为若干集。这是大跃进的编辑计划所放射出的一个大卫星。它将把领导中国革命和中国人民解放军的党的光荣传于永远。
    第一卷第一集的“星火燎原”，分为上下两册。我在它们未用铅字印成之前阅读了一遍，一点也不虚假地是
  “跑马观花”。但这“跑马”并不是由于我主观上的草率，而是由于客观上的“花”逼得我骑上千里马大跑而特跑。文字和故事太吸引人了，读了上节逼得你必须抢读下节，读了上篇逼得你必须抢读下篇，读了上册逼得你必须抢读下册。因此，我不仅在“跑马”，简直是乘着火箭在群星中飞行。我现在的迫切期待是：快些编好第二集，乃至整个四卷。
    执笔的人是从元帅以至退役战士，这就具体表现着官兵平等。他们都写出自己在革命斗争中亲身的经历，最艰难的处境，最惊险的遭遇，最曲折的经过，最出人意外的场面，有胜利，有失败，有深沉的悲痛，有热烈的欢呼，都由他们从难忘的记忆中记录出来。真人真事，真刀真枪，这是比任何虚构的文学作品还要吸引人的。这是名实相符的集体创作，是一串真珠的颈环——不，是一条红宝石砌成的万里长城！
    是的，是一串或者一条。虽然是征文集，执笔者各不相谋，你写你的，我写我的，地分东西南北，年历三十春秋，然而决不是一盘杂碎，一片散砂。因为，这儿在事的骨干上有革命斗争的一贯联系，在人的性格上有共产主义者的一品风格，甚至在笔的运用上都有准确、鲜明、生动的色彩。这是多么的统一，是无数具有同样形态的晶体分子的总结晶。当然，现在才仅看到“星火燎原”，但已看出了一个体系的开端。檀木从仅具两瓣子叶的嫩苗开始就是香的。随着历史的发展，无论怎样迂回曲折，或进或退，或遭到阻碍，或突破艰险，就像在地图上画了一条粗大的带有箭头的红线一样，始终在联系着而且不断进展着。
    这条粗大红线是什么？那就是党的领导，就是把马克思列宁主义的大道理和中国的实际逐步紧密地扣合了起来，正确地领导着中国革命的毛泽东思想，特别是他的军事思想。中国革命是由无产阶级领导的工农联盟的革命，是由工农联盟的革命武装对反革命武装的斗争。这一革命斗争逐步形成了以革命的农村包围反革命的城市的局面，而终于使大片深红色的面消灭了大大小小零星的白点，使整个中国变成了一面大红旗。三十年的历史不能算太短，但从这“星火燎原”中已经看出革命胜利的苗头来了。虽然还只是“星火”，却已具备了“燎原”的气势。
    这当然是一部很好的革命史料，研究近代史的人从这里可以挖出无限丰富的矿藏。这更是一部进行爱国主义和国际主义教育的革命教科书，每一个中国公民，特别是青少年都必须读它，从这波浪重叠的革命史实中来训练自己。前一辈的人是经历了多么艰难的折磨，流洒了多少的鲜血，牺牲了多少宝贵的生命，才使得革命事业胜利了呵！我们今天享受着革命胜利的果实，不能不饮水思源，更不能不竭尽全力来巩固我们的革命胜利，并扩大我们的革命胜利。
    在今天和今后，像在革命事业缔造时代的那种超绝想像的艰难痛苦，在我们是可能不会再有了。大陆上的反革命基本上已经消灭；在不断进行革命教育中，毫无疑问，人们都在“鼓足干劲，力争上游”。但是，我们的领土台湾还被美帝国主义侵占着，台湾岛上八百万的中国同胞还在受着水深火热的痛苦。而且以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团还在封锁着我们，而且公开声明要颠复我们的人民政权。最近美国政府所公布的不承认中华人民共和国的备忘录，就明目张胆地说：我们的政权“有一天会消失”。美国的好战分子杜勒斯之流，他们不仅在发出这样荒谬绝伦的谬论，而且还在进行着荒谬绝伦的冒险。我们知道，帝国主义是在作死亡的挣扎；但在它还未死亡、还在挣扎的时候，我们不能不提高警惕，提防着狗急跳墙所可能引起的意外的灾难。
    帝国主义就是战争根源，帝国主义存在一天，持久的世界和平是没有绝对的保障的。在目前不仅台湾岛上的同胞们还在帝国主义的铁蹄蹂躏之下，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲还有好些未被解放的民族，同样在帝国主义的铁蹄之下受着折磨。这些未被解放的民族对于我们中国人民革命的胜利正怀抱着无限的憧憬，他们希望能够很好地学习我们的经验，步我们的后尘，以求得全面的解放。近年来亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国争取民族独立和反抗殖民主义的运动，正风起云涌，同帝国主义者正在进行着生死存亡的搏斗。我们中国人民根据自己亲身的体验对于这种正义的斗争是怀抱着无限同情的，谁也不愿意作壁上观，因而，我们就更加感觉着有必要：时时刻刻作着精神上的准备！
    我们要维护和平就必须消灭战争根源。我们要消灭战争根源，就必须有压倒战争势力的力量。战争狂人如果发动战争，必须给予以迎头痛击，把它彻底打倒。从这里可以深切的认识到：我们的中国人民解放军不仅是祖国安全的坚强的保卫者，并且是世界和平的坚强的保卫者。我们不仅要爱戴他，加强他，而且要学习他！我们每一个非武装的同志都应该向人民解放军的战士们学习，要把自己锻炼成钢铁战士在各个岗位上进行战斗，而在必要时还要同帝国主义侵略者进行肉搏，要进行这种精神准备当然有种种的途径，但尽可能抽出时间来阅读这部革命教科书——“光荣的中国人民解放军”，我认为也就是很好的方法之一。
    我在这里还有几个初步的建议。
    首先，我对于编辑委员会有两个相反而平行的要求：一个是尽量地征集，一个是尽量的精选。这两项工作是要同时并进的。尽量地征集是请求对于材料不要选择过严，这样宝贵的史料多多益善，应该不计工拙，有文必录。当然，在文字上尽可以加以必要的润色。总之，材料是愈多愈好的。
    尽量精选是要求从每一集中选出最有教育意义、写得最精采的文字编为选集，好让广泛的群众，特别是青少年，都能够购买、阅读，人手一编，作为教育自己的课本。全部四卷书将来编成后还不知道要有多少册，那必然是一部浩瀚的文献。一般的同志买不起，更难有功夫来读完，因此在编辑出版全书的同时，实在有必要编出选集。这工作是并不那么费事的。选集别立名目也可以，例如仿照“解放军文艺”的例子就称为“解放军读本”似乎也没有什么不妥。
    其次，在编辑出版中文的同时应该考虑翻译的问题，译成国内兄弟民族的文字或外文。外文的翻译，像俄文、英文、法文、西班牙文是不可缺少的。有了翻译本，那么革命斗争经验的传播，特别是毛主席的军事思想的传播，就会更加广泛了。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民，上面已经说过，对于我们的革命是怀抱着无限的憧憬，我们的极其丰富的反殖民主义、反封建主义的斗争经验，很可以供他们参考；而且他们也很愿意接受而加以体会的。为了推动全世界反殖民主义争取民族独立的斗争，中国经验的外文传播是有十分的必要。这是一项大工程，全书的翻译如果一时有困难，我上面所说到的选集——“解放军读本”的翻译应该是比较容易进行的。这样，不仅对近代世界史会提供高贵的史料，而对于世界文学宝库也将会增添不少的无价之宝。
    再其次，我要特别向从事文艺工作的同志们提出建议。当然，我们也应该学习革命先烈和钢铁将士们的精神来铸造自己，但从文艺工作的岗位上来说，我们每一个人都应该从这部革命史诗里收集材料，来加以提炼、综合、发展，结晶成为多种多样的、有声有色的宏篇巨制。这里的许多故事尽可以发展成为小说、戏剧、说唱；尽可以表现成为雕刻、绘画、电影；就是音乐、舞蹈、建筑也会从这里得到不少雄壮的母题吧。让我举一个例。例如广州部队征稿组所征集的“石龙县里”就是很可以大大地加以发展的故事。
    这是关于琼崖工农红军的故事。红军遭到国民党反动部队的进攻，被打散了，人民遭受到空前的浩劫。红军医院，设在乐会、万宁两县交界处的六连岭脚下，也不得不把伤员疏散了。剩下不能行动的七十名重伤员，由军医主任王绍华同两位护士，搬运到一处高峰下的山坳里。那山坳有点像条睡着的龙，因而他们就命名为“石龙县”。
    房子是没有的，找些树枝和芭蕉叶来搭成了草寮。家具呢只有三把镊子、一个水桶和几件破炊具。药品是没有的，就只能用树叶蘸水来洗伤口。带的粮食很快就吃完了，为了找粮食并医疗伤员，那位王绍华主任在敌人的严密封锁之下煞费了苦心。在苦难中撑持了三个月，不仅解决了粮食问题，并终于用土方法把伤员治好了。七十名战士都奔向海南岛的各个角落。
    故事着意地写了王绍华的负责态度和阶级友爱，有些地方是很动人的。例如他第一次趁着黑夜摸过敌人的封锁线去向老百姓借粮。他摸到一间小房子里，找到一位“快要皮包骨头”的老妈妈。那老妈妈看到红军的人便高兴极了，从床头拿出一小罐子，舀米给他，舀到第三碗便听到碗碰到罐底的声响。王绍华不忍心，他把这最后半碗米倒还了罐子里。这是多么动人的情景呵！
    其后王绍华屡次冒险去借粮，老乡们尽自己所有的多寡，有的给半升一升，有的给半碗一碗；就靠着老乡们的支持，这七十几个人的三个月的生活便得以维持下去。
    王绍华又在医疗上想办法尽了自己的责任。他用内服的退热草药敷在创口上居然治好了化脓的创伤。他还不断地向老乡们请教，用了各种各样的草药，同时又用普通的针线来进行外科手术，他终于把那些伤员都治好了。
    不长的叙述写王绍华主任是相当用力，但依然太简单。在王主任之外其他同志们的活动和心理状态更写得太少。两位护士身上是很可以做文章的。“知道领导上的困难，谁也不哼一声”，“宁愿饿死，不肯让主任去冒险”的伤员们，借粮的老乡们，传授土办法治伤的老乡们，都可以做文章。特别是关于那位“快要皮包骨头”的老妈妈，更可以把文章大做特做。我相信她是替王主任做了一连串工作的，靠着她的活动联络了那些老乡们，才继续不断地有半升一升、半碗一碗米粮的捐助，才继续不断地有各种治伤土办法的传授。敌情的缓急、行动的安排、路径的向导，在这些地方都大有文章可写。不然，在三个月之后，七十几名战士怎样就能够安全撤退呢？
    我这不过是仅仅举出一个简单的例子。这样的例子全书中有的是，文艺工作者如果接触到灵感，尽可以用力把故事展开。当然在这里是需要作进一步的准备的。例如上举“石龙县里”的一例，如果作家们要发展就需得往琼崖当地去看一看。老乡们是还在的，伤员们、医师、护士们可能都还在——至少总还有人在，作家就需得尽可能就这些人去打听当时的情形，对于故事加以血肉的补充。即使加上些合理的想像成份，我认为也是可以允许的。无论作怎样详细的调查，事实的全貌终不可能完整无缺地调查明白。在典型环境中的典型人物是可以允许综合性地创造的。如果文艺工作者肯采取这样的办法，我相信在文艺战线上，这部书的“星火”又将引起“燎原”的现象了。
