    Two Thousand Steel Bricks
    Grandpa held his long-stemmed dry tobacco pipe, knocking out a bag of tobacco after only a few puffs, then refilling it, knocking it out again… his eyes were fixed, clearly showing he was troubled.
    After dinner, I deliberately approached Grandpa, wanting to get to the bottom of it. Once we started talking, Grandpa brought up the matter I had mentioned when I came home the day before: "You said your school is short of steel bricks for iron smelting?" "Yes, Grandpa, otherwise our furnace would have produced iron long ago!" "Oh, I happen to have one or two thousand steel bricks, but…" I thought Grandpa was going to set conditions, so I quickly said, "We'll buy them from you." Grandpa waved his hand: "Bah, where are you dragging this? I mean, just give the bricks to the public, and don't say where they came from, lest people laugh…" I sensed something strange in his words, so I pressed him for details. Grandpa lowered his voice, as if afraid of being overheard, and told me the following story:
    Around the time of the victory against the Japanese, Grandpa was growing vegetables for a landlord in the suburbs. There was some kind of Japanese factory nearby. The Japanese devils had all run away, and the locals had taken everything useful. Grandpa's legs weren't good, so he didn't get anything. He saw a pile of foreign bricks in the yard, strangely smooth, and thought, "I've toiled my whole life and never lived in a brick house. I'll live in a brick house when I die." So, he used these bricks to build a tomb frame, planning to be buried there after his death. After liberation, life became better and better, and Grandpa had long since moved into a brick house. However, he had always kept the secret of his tomb.
    The next day, we unearthed more than two thousand steel bricks from that tomb, and a small blast furnace was born. But I couldn't keep Grandpa's secret and told the school. The school offered Grandpa some money, which Grandpa repeatedly refused. The school wanted to build another tomb frame with red bricks to thank him, but Grandpa got even angrier, saying, "No need, I still want to enjoy ten or twenty more years of the good times of communist society!"

    两千块钢砖
    爷爷手拿尺把长的旱烟管，一袋烟没吸几口就嗑掉了，又装一袋，又嗑……眼珠儿可是呆呆的，一看就知道他有心事。
  晚饭后，我故意凑到爷爷跟前，想探个究竟。话一拉起来，爷爷就提起前天我回家讲过的事情：“你说你们学校炼铁缺钢砖？”“是呀爷爷，要不我们的炉早就出铁啦！”“噢，我倒有一两千块钢砖，不过……”我以为爷爷要讲条件，便抢着说：“我们出钱买你的。”爷爷把手一挥：“呔，你这拉哪去啦。我是说，砖给了公家就算了，别说是哪来的，看人笑话……。”我听这话有点蹊跷，便追问起来。爷爷压低了嗓音，生怕被人偷听去似的给我讲了下面一段故事：
    抗日胜利那时，爷爷正在郊区给地主种菜园子。附近有一个日本鬼子的什么工厂，鬼子们都跑了，可用的东西都被附近人们拿走了，爷爷腿脚不灵，什么也没有捞到。他一看院里有一堆洋砖，怪光滑的，心想：“劳碌一辈子没住过一间砖房，死了住个砖房吧。”于是，他便用这些砖修了一座坟框子，预备自己死后好在那里安葬。解放后，日子越过越美，爷爷早已住上了砖房。可是，他一直保守了他那坟地的秘密。
    第二天，我们从那坟地里起出了两千多块钢砖，一座小高炉就此诞生了。可是我没能够遵守爷爷的嘱咐，把秘密告诉了学校。学校给爷爷一笔钱，爷爷百般推辞了。学校想用红砖再砌一个坟框来酬谢，谁知这一下爷爷更火了，说：“用不着，我还要再过它十年二十年的共产主义社会的好光景哩！”
