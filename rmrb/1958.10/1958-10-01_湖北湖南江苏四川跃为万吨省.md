This newspaper, Wuhan, 30th - Hubei Province launched a great satellite on the 29th, producing 16,912 tons of pig iron in a single day, as a gift to National Day. On this day, six counties in the province, including Hong'an, Echeng, Sui County, Baokang, Luotian, and Macheng, each produced over 1,000 tons, and the daily output of Xiangyang and Huanggang regions reached over 5,000 tons respectively.

　　On the 29th, more than 184,300 iron-smelting furnaces in Hubei Province produced molten iron. Nearly six million people in the province were mobilized in this battle of steel production.

　　In this battle on the steel front, Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and most members of the Provincial Party Committee personally supervised the battle in key counties and cities. The first secretaries of various regional and county party committees also slept next to the blast furnaces, working hard day and night. The Huanggang region proposed to produce 2,000 tons of pig iron daily before National Day. Now, this target has been far surpassed.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th - Jubilant news came from the steel front in Hunan Province. On the 29th, the province produced a total of 15,517 tons of pig iron. Five counties, including Lianyuan, Xinhua, Shaodong, Shuangfeng, and Youxian, each reached over 1,000 tons. On this day, the province also produced 1,000 tons of steel.

　　Hunan Province achieved such brilliant results on the eve of National Day mainly because the Party committees at all levels implemented the correct policy of "small-scale, indigenous methods, and the mass line," mobilizing the whole Party and all the people to vigorously engage in steel production. The large-scale iron production on the 29th came from the 28,964 indigenous blast furnaces put into production throughout the province. On this day, 7 million people and 100,000 cadres participated in iron smelting, more than doubling the number in early September.

　　While the people of Hunan Province celebrated the large-scale increase in steel production, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee put forward new combat tasks to the Party committees at all levels and the people of the province.

This newspaper, Nanjing, 30th - Jiangsu Province produced 14,924.733 tons of iron (including 4,851.74 tons of sintered iron) in the 24 hours from noon on the 29th to noon on the 30th.

　　On this day, the people of all cities in the province came out in full force, and countless streams of people from all directions in the countryside flowed to the iron-smelting bases. Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Hui Yuyu and Xu Jiatun, as well as leaders at all levels, personally directed operations at the iron-smelting bases.

　　Most of the participants in this high-yield daily production used small, indigenous furnaces.

This newspaper, Chongqing, 30th - The Sichuan Province steel front achieved a complete victory on the 30th, with a daily pig iron output of 10,200 tons and a daily steel output of 5,500 tons. Three days ago, the province's daily pig iron output was only over 2,000 tons, and there were only 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces in production. However, after the day and night efforts of 10 million steelworkers, nearly 50,000 indigenous blast furnaces and various open-hearth furnaces and converters were put into production throughout the province in just two or three days.

    湖北湖南江苏四川跃为万吨省
    本报武汉30日电　湖北省在29日发射出日产生铁一万六千九百十二吨的大卫星，向国庆节献礼。全省在这一天里出现了红安、鄂城、随县、保康、罗田、麻城等六个千吨县，襄阳专区和黄冈专区的日产量，分别达到五千吨以上。
    29日这天湖北省共有十八万四千三百多座炼铁炉流出了铁水。全省这天上阵的钢铁大军近六百万人。
    在这场钢铁战线上的战役中，中共湖北省委第一书记王任重等和大部分省委委员都分别到各重点县市亲自督战。各个地委、县委的第一书记也都睡到高炉旁边，日夜苦干。黄冈专区提出要在国庆节前日产生铁二千吨。而现在已经远远把这个指标抛在后面了。
  据新华社长沙30日电　湖南省钢铁战线传来捷报。29日，全省共产生铁一万五千五百十七吨。涟源、新化、邵东、双峰、攸县等五县都达到了千吨以上。这一天，全省还产钢一千吨。
    湖南省在国庆前夕获得这样辉煌的战果，主要是因为各级党委贯彻了“小型、土法、群众路线”的正确方针，全党全民总动员，放手大搞钢铁生产。29日，全省大面积丰产的生铁就是从各地投入生产的二万八千九百六十四座土高炉中炼出来的。这一天参加炼铁的群众有七百万人，干部十万人，都比9月上旬激增两倍多。
    在湖南省全民欢庆钢铁大面积增产的同时，中共湖南省委又向各级党委和全省人民提出新的战斗任务。
    本报南京30日电　江苏省自29日中午到30日中午一昼夜间，产铁一万四千九百二十四点七三三吨（其中包括四千八百五十一点七四吨烧结铁）。
    这天，省内各城市人民倾城出动，农村中无数的人流从四面八方通向炼铁基地。中共江苏省委第一书记江渭清和书记惠浴宇、许家屯以及各级领导干部，都亲临炼铁基地指挥作战。
    参加这个高产日生产的大部分是小土炉。
    本报重庆30日电　四川省钢铁战线30日全线大捷，生铁日产量已达到一万零二百吨，钢的日产量达到五千五百吨。三天以前，全省日产生铁还不过二千多吨，投入生产的土高炉也不过一万座，但经过一千万钢铁大军昼夜奋战，短短两三天内，全省就有近五万座土高炉和各式炼钢平炉、转炉投入生产。
