Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 23rd: On the afternoon of October 20th, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, He Long, accompanied by Wei Heng, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Acting Governor of Shanxi Province, met with over sixty people, including the heads of the delegations, athletes, and representatives of sports workers from various special districts and cities attending the First Shanxi Provincial People's Sports Games.

After listening to the report on Shanxi's sports work, Vice Premier He Long gave important instructions. He said: "It is not easy for Shanxi to hold such a large-scale sports meet. The Party and the government have put in so much effort, you must ensure that this sports meet is well-organized from beginning to end." He emphasized that Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to sports work and the health of the Chinese people. As early as forty years ago, he wrote the article "A Study of Physical Education," which has great theoretical and political enlightenment for us, and everyone should study and research it carefully. Chairman Mao personally wrote the inscription: "Develop sports and strengthen the people's physique." This is the fundamental task of our sports work. At the same time, Chairman Mao himself also participated in physical exercise and crossed the Yangtze River several times. He is a role model for us to learn from. Chairman Mao recently inspected Hubei and proposed that people's communes should vigorously establish militia divisions, saying that militia divisions are military organizations, as well as labor organizations, educational organizations, and sports organizations. We must carefully study these instructions. Sports work should revolve around one center, and that center is production and national defense. Sports for production, sports for national defense, and national defense is also for production. If sports is not for production or for national defense, then our sports is a waste."

He emphasized: "Sports work is a major matter related to the health of 600 million people. To do a good job in sports work, the main thing is to rely on the leadership of the Party and to put politics in command. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, people's communes, and student unions should cooperate. The most important thing for athletes is to listen to the Party. Playing ball is mainly about playing politics, not just about playing technique. We must closely integrate politics with technique. Everyone must plant a red flag, and everyone must be both red and expert. Redness comes first, expertise comes second. Athletes must never be arrogant. Don't stick your tail up. If you stick it up, we will beat it down or cut it off."

When talking about preparing for next year's National Games, he said: "China's industrial and agricultural production and various construction undertakings are making great leaps forward, and sports work must also catch up."

Vice Premier He Long then pointed out that to carry out sports activities, we must break down superstitions, break down superstitions about foreign countries, professors, and experts. We value the guidance of professors and experts, but they must first be students and then teachers; then be students again and then teachers again. Only then will they be useful. This is the mass line that Chairman Mao said: "From the masses, to the masses." We cannot be superstitious about dogma, and we must have a spirit of originality. We must strengthen the political education of sports workers and athletes. We must boldly pull out white flags and plant red flags. It is not acceptable for the sports world not to carry out ideological struggle. This is a struggle between two roads.

Vice Premier He Long said that sports work should first focus on track and field. Track and field is the foundation, and all sports activities are inseparable from track and field. We must do a good job in track and field. Popularizing track and field is not restricted by venues, and you can exercise everywhere, and anyone can participate, so it is easy to popularize. He particularly pointed out: "We must cultivate a large number of athletes among workers and peasants. Intellectual athletes must be reformed, and the collective strength and wisdom of athletes must be brought into play. Three cobblers are as good as one Zhuge Liang." He concluded: "Our nation is hardworking, brave, and simple, and has a tradition of national sports. We must study it and carry it forward."

    体育为生产　体育为国防
    贺龙副总理在太原对体育工作作了重要指示
    新华社太原23日电　国务院副总理、体育运动委员会主任贺龙20日下午在中共山西省委书记处书记、山西省代省长卫恒的陪同下，接见了正在这里出席山西省第一届人民体育运动大会的各专区、市代表队的总领队、运动员和体育工作者代表等共六十多人。
    贺龙副总理在听取了山西省体育工作的汇报以后作了重要指示。他说：山西能开这么大的运动会，很不容易。党和政府花了这么大的力量，你们一定要把这次运动会有始有终的开好。他强调说，毛主席从来就很重视体育工作，重视我国人民的健康。早在四十年前，就写过“体育之研究”文章，这篇文章在理论上、政治上对我们都有很大启示，大家要好好学习、研究。毛主席亲手题词：“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，这是我们体育工作的根本任务。同时毛主席自己也参加体育锻炼，曾几次横渡长江。是我们学习的榜样。毛主席最近在湖北视察，提出人民公社要大办民兵师，说民兵师是军事组织，又是劳动组织、教育组织和体育组织，我们要很好地研究这些指示。体育工作应该围绕一个中心，这个中心就是生产和国防。体育为生产，体育为国防，国防也是为了生产。如果体育不是为了生产、为了国防，那我们的体育就是白搞了。
    他强调指出：体育工作是关系六亿人民健康的大事，要做好体育工作，主要的应依靠党的领导，政治挂帅。工会、共青团、人民公社、学生会要共同配合。运动员最重要的一条就是要听党的话。打球主要是打政治，不是光打技术。要把政治与技术紧密结合起来。人人都要插红旗，人人都要又红又专。第一是红，第二是专。运动员千万骄傲不得。不能翘尾巴，翘起来就要把它打下去或把它割掉。
    在谈到迎接明年全国运动会的时候，他说：我国工农业生产和各项建设事业都在大跃进，体育工作也得赶上去。
    贺龙副总理接着指出，开展体育运动，必须破除迷信，破除对外国、对教授、专家的迷信。教授、专家的指导我们是重视的，但是他们必须先当学生后当先生；再当学生再当先生。这样他们才有用。这就是毛主席所说的：“从群众中来到群众中去”的群众路线。我们不能迷信教条，要有独创精神。要加强对体育工作者和运动员的政治教育。要大胆拔白旗插红旗。体育界不进行思想斗争是不行的，这是两条道路的斗争。
    贺龙副总理说，体育工作首先要抓田径，田径是基础，各项体育运动都离不开田径，要把田径搞好。普及田径不受场地限制，到处都可以锻炼，什么人都可以参加，所以也容易普及。他特别指出：要大量在工人、农民中培养运动员。知识分子运动员要改造，要发挥运动员的集体力量和智慧。三个臭皮匠，就顶个诸葛亮。他最后说：我们的民族是勤劳、勇敢、朴素的，有民族体育传统，我们要很好地研究它、发扬它。
