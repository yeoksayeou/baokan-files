    The First Sweet Potato Sputnik
    Liuyang One Mu Field Produced More Than 560,000 Jin
    (Our Newspaper’s Dispatch) The Huanghu Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Liuyang County launched a sweet potato "Sputnik" with a yield of 567,570 jin per mu.
    This "Sputnik" was launched from 1.03 mu of stony yellow mud land. It was an experimental field cultivated jointly by five people: Shou Jiusheng, the former cadre of the small commune, team cadres Tang Buwen and Huang Sanhua, veteran farmer Huang Haiquan, and commune member Tang Yanbang. It produced 584,597 jin, averaging 567,570 jin per mu. They adopted a series of advanced measures. In addition to selecting a good variety with a clear and reddish skin, starting early in the season, using warm beds for raising seedlings, and applying sufficient base fertilizer as frost protection, the main factors were deep plowing, adding soil, and close planting. This piece of land was plowed to a depth of 3.5 chi; topdressing and adding soil were done four times, increasing the depth by another 1.5 chi, making the soil a total of 5 chi deep. The quincunx-shaped horizontal planting method was used, with more than 23,000 seedlings planted per mu. The harvesting of this "Sputnik" field began on October 18th, and ninety people spent three days digging it all up. When digging the sweet potatoes, the upper-middle peasants Huang Linshou and Huang Baizhou, who had previously ridiculed Shou Jiusheng and others, saw the sweet potatoes being dug up more and more, piled up like mountains, and their tone changed, saying, "The sea cannot be measured with a dipper." On the 20th, Li Yingxing, member of the Liuyang County Committee and County Head, was specially sent by the CPC Liuyang County Committee to inspect the harvest in person. Dai Boyun, First Secretary of the CPC Hongzhuan People's Commune, and more than ten cadres from the County Agricultural Bureau also participated in the inspection.

    第一颗甘薯大卫星
    浏阳一亩田产了五十六万多斤
    本报讯　浏阳县红专人民公社红旗大队黄浒中队发射了红薯亩产五十六万七千五百七十斤的大卫星。
    这个卫星是从一点零三亩石子黄泥土地发射出来的，是由原小社办社干部首九生和队干部汤卜文、黄三华、老农黄海泉、社员唐彦邦等五人共同培植的试验田，共产五十八万四千五百九十七斤，平均亩产五十六万七千五百七十斤。他们采取了一系列的先进措施，除选择清秀皮红的良种，提早季节，进行温床育苗和下足底肥作为防冻工作外，主要是由于深耕加土密植的结果。这块土深耕三点五尺；分层追肥加土四次，又增加一点五尺，土壤共达五尺。用品字形平插密植的方法，每亩插到二万三千多蔸。这块“卫星”田从10月18日开始收挖，九十人共挖了三天才挖完。挖薯时，原来曾经讽刺嘲笑首九生等的上中农黄林寿、黄百州，看到红薯越挖越多，堆积如山，他们的口气也变了，说：“海水不可斗量”。20日中共浏阳县委特派县常委、县长李映兴亲往验收，参加验收的还有中共红专人民公社第一书记戴伯芸及县农业局干部等十余人。
