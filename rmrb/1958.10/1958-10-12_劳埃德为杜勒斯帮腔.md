    Lloyd Echoes Dulles
    By Pan Fei, our correspondent
    The British government's two-faced approach to the Taiwan issue has once again been nakedly exposed in Lloyd's foreign policy speech.
    Lloyd's speech was delivered at the Conservative Party's annual meeting on the 10th. He complained that the Labor Party had made too many criticisms of the U.S. government, which "caused trouble for the U.S. government and affected its position in negotiations." He blamed the Labor Party for not criticizing China for "using force," thus "encouraging" China to resolve the issue by force. For this reason, Lloyd asked for understanding of the U.S. government's situation. He said: "The U.S. government is in a very difficult position. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles themselves have pointed out the military difficulties in defending Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu) Islands. On the other hand, the political reason is that if Jinmen and Mazu are handed over to the Communists because of the Communist use of force, it may cause a chain reaction and may have very serious consequences in the Far East."
    Lloyd greatly publicized the "role" Britain played in the Taiwan issue. He said: "In this situation, we strive to exert all our influence to support negotiations and peaceful resolution." What kind of "peaceful resolution" is it? Lloyd immediately added a note: "Ceasefire on both sides."
    Lloyd asked people to pay attention: "There is a treaty between the United States and the Chinese Kuomintang. According to a resolution of Congress, the President has the right to approve the use of force in the Taiwan Strait under certain circumstances." While echoing the U.S. war provocations and helping the U.S. carry out military blackmail, Lloyd actually wanted people to pay attention to the illegal treaty between the U.S. and Chiang. This is really absurd! As Foreign Minister, Lloyd has forgotten that Britain has diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and he regards the Kuomintang group as a subject of international law. Isn't this self-defeating and ridiculous? Either Britain should recognize the Kuomintang group, or it should regard the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government of China. The attitude should be straightforward. It is impossible to pretend to be confused on this point.
    True, Lloyd also reiterated Britain's position on the Far East issue, stating that it does not intend to participate in the U.S. military adventures in the Far East. He said: "We have not been asked to provide military assistance. We have not provided military assistance, and there is no question of Britain being involved in the armed defense of Jinmen and Mazu." However, when this passage is compared with what was said above, it constitutes most clearly Britain's two-faced attitude on the Far East issue. In short, this is: on the one hand, it is worried that the United States will provoke a new world war in the Far East, thereby endangering Britain's interests in Asia and other parts of the world. Because in the British ruling group, as long as the head is not as hard as granite, he understands that as soon as the guns of a new world war sound, the "British Empire" will be finished immediately. On the other hand, Britain is trying to excuse the United States everywhere, and even echoing the U.S. military provocations, unreasonably demanding that China "ceasefire."
    The "Daily Telegraph" once succinctly summarized Britain's policy on the Taiwan issue as follows: neither "showdown" with China on the coastal islands issue, nor make "unconditional concessions." Then, may I ask the chief writer of the "Daily Telegraph": What are the "conditions" you are hoping for? The implication is nothing more than to force China to succumb to U.S. military provocations, damage the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, and attempt to weaken the international status of the People's Republic of China, limit its influence, and reduce its prestige - this is precisely the goal that some Western gentlemen have been dreaming of.
    In the capitalist world, Britain is still a major country. If Britain is really willing to ease the situation in the Far East, it can undoubtedly do many things. Unfortunately, according to the speech on the 10th, the British Foreign Minister obviously did not take the right path.

    劳埃德为杜勒斯帮腔
    本报记者　潘非
    英国政府在台湾问题上所要的两面手法，在劳埃德的外交政策演说中又一次赤裸裸地暴露了。
    劳埃德的演说，是在10日的保守党年会上发表的。他埋怨工党对美国政府作了过多的批评，这就为“美国政府添了麻烦，并且影响到它在谈判中的地位”。他责备工党没有对中国“使用武力”提出任何批评，因而“鼓励”了中国凭借武力来解决问题。为此，劳埃德要求体谅美国政府的处境。他说：“美国政府的处境非常困难。艾森豪威尔总统和国务卿杜勒斯先生自己都指出了在保卫金门岛和马祖岛方面存在着军事困难。另一方面，政治上的理由是：如果由于共产党使用武力而把金门岛和马祖移交给共产党的话，可能引起链式反应而且可能在远东产生非常严重的后果。”
    劳埃德对英国在台湾问题上所起的“作用”大事宣扬。他说：“在这种情势下，我们力求施展全部影响支持谈判和和平解决。”是什么样的“和平解决”呢？劳埃德马上加一注解：“双方停火”。
    劳埃德要求人们注意：“在美国与中国国民党之间存在着一项条约。根据国会的一项决议，总统有权于某种情况下批准在台湾海峡使用武力。”劳埃德在附和美国的战争挑衅行为，帮助美国进行军事讹诈的同时，竟然要人们重视美蒋之间订有非法条约，这真是荒唐透顶！作为外交大臣，劳埃德竟忘记了英国是同中华人民共和国建立有外交关系的，而俨然把国民党集团看作一个国际法的主体，这岂非自打嘴巴，贻笑天下？要么，英国就去承认国民党集团；要么，就该把中华人民共和国看作中国唯一的合法政府。态度应该干脆俐落。要想在这一点上装胡涂，那是不行的。
    不错，劳埃德也重申英国在远东问题上的立场，表示并不打算参与美国在远东的军事冒险。他说：“没有要求我们提供军事援助。我们没有提供军事援助，并不存在英国卷入武力保卫金门和马祖的问题。”但是，这段话同上面所讲的对照起来看，恰恰最清楚不过地构成了英国在远东问题上的两面态度。扼要地说，这就是：它一方面担心美国在远东挑起新的世界战争，从而危及英国在亚洲及世界其他地区的利益。因为在英国的统治集团中，只要头脑还没有硬到像花岗石这种地步，他就懂得：新的世界大战炮声一响，“大英帝国”就马上完蛋。而另一方面，英国却又处处替美国开脱责任，甚至附和美国的军事挑衅，毫无理由地要求中国“停火”。
    “每日电讯报”曾经简练地把英国在台湾问题上的政策归纳如下：既不要在沿海岛屿问题上同中国“摊牌”，也不要作“无条件的让步”。那末请问“每日电讯报”的大主笔：你所指望的“条件”是什么呢？言外之意，无非是要中国在美国的军事挑衅面前屈服，损害中华人民共和国的主权，并企图由此来削弱中华人民共和国的国际地位，限制它的影响，降低它的威望——这正是某些西方绅士梦寐以求的目的。
    在资本主义世界中，英国还不失为一个大国。如果英国真的愿意缓和远东局势，无疑地它可以作许多事情。遗憾的是，根据10日的演说，英国外交大臣显然没有走对道路。
