Key Equipment for the Electronic Tube Industry
48-Spindle High Vacuum Rotary Exhaust Machine Born in Beijing

(Our dispatch) The Beijing Electronic Tube Factory has successfully trial-produced a 48-spindle high vacuum rotary exhaust machine.

The 48-spindle high vacuum rotary exhaust machine can achieve a high vacuum in thumb-sized vacuum tubes. It is a key piece of equipment in the electronic tube manufacturing industry, and the arrangement of other manpower, equipment, and technology mainly depends on it. Its successful trial production has written a glorious page for China's self-made high vacuum equipment in the field of vacuum electronics.

The 48-spindle high vacuum rotary exhaust machine was designed by Dong Dawei, a young mechanic and Beijing Municipal Industrial Labor Model, with the help of experienced workers and with reference to the equipment drawings of the Soviet E—331—04 type 24-spindle rotary exhaust machine, and some improvements were made. More than 20,000 precision parts of the rotary exhaust machine were processed and assembled using domestic materials.

(Our dispatch) The Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced the first domestically-made new type of hydraulic drilling machine.

This drilling machine, named "Leap Forward No. 65," is highly precise, equipped with various precision instruments, easy to control, simple and safe to operate, and can save manpower and reduce labor intensity.

The successful trial production of this new type of hydraulic drilling machine marks that China's prospecting machinery manufacturing has reached a new level and has also opened up a new path for China's exploration technology.

    电子管工业的关键设备
    48轴高真空圆排车在北京诞生
    本报讯　北京电子管厂试制48轴高真空圆排车成功。
    48轴高真空圆排车能使拇指型真空管得到高真空，它是电子管制造工业的关键设备，其它人力、设备、工艺技术的安排主要取决于它。它的试制成功，为我国电真空事业自制高真空设备写下了光辉的一页。
    48轴高真空圆排车是年轻的机械师、北京市工业劳动模范董大为在老师傅的帮助下，参考苏联E—331—04型24轴圆排车设备图进行设计的，并作了些改进。圆排车的两万多精密零件都是用国产材料加工、装备成的。
    本报讯　张家口探矿机械厂最近试制成功国产第一台新型油压钻探机。
    这台命名为跃进号65型的钻机，精密度高，机上装置各种精密仪表，易于控制掌握，操作简单而安全，能节省人力，减轻劳动强度。
    这种新型油压钻探机的试制成功，标志着我国探矿机械制造已达到了一个新的水平，也为我国勘探技术开辟了新的道路。
