Not a Single Potato Lost, Not a Single Potato Rotten
Various Regions Tensely Store and Process Sweet Potatoes

(By our own correspondent) Harvesting, storing, and processing the unprecedentedly abundant sweet potato crop is an extremely urgent and crucial task in the current rush to complete the "Three Autumns" work in various regions. This battle has fiercely begun in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, and preparations for emergency harvesting are being stepped up in southern regions.

This year, the national sweet potato planting area has expanded by more than 60% compared to last year, reaching over 250 million mu. Currently, the potato harvest in northern regions has been completed; about 30% of the sweet potatoes in the Yellow River basin have been harvested; the battle to rush-harvest sweet potatoes in the Huai River and Yangtze River basins has also begun; and the rush-harvesting work in southern regions is about to start. In areas where harvesting has already taken place, large areas of high-yield fields and high-yield "satellite" fields are constantly emerging. In Hongzhuan People's Commune, Liuyang County, Hunan Province, 1.03 mu of sweet potato land produced a grand "satellite" yield of 567,570 jin per mu.

This year's sweet potato growth is characterized by: large potatoes, deep rooting, dense planting, and high yield, coupled with the expansion of the planting area compared to previous years, making the harvesting work quite arduous. In order to strive for "not losing a single one, not rotting a single one," major sweet potato producing areas, in addition to starting the harvest earlier than in previous years, have also organized specialized large-scale sweet potato harvesting forces, setting up camps in the fields to conduct round-the-clock emergency work, without delaying iron and steel production or autumn plowing and planting. Many regions have adopted various methods to ensure timely harvesting and avoid losses, greatly tapping labor potential and accelerating the promotion of improved tools to speed up the harvest. Hejian County in Hebei Province, Xichong, Longchang, and Cangxi counties in Sichuan Province, and Shandong Province have widely promoted animal-powered potato diggers using double-wheeled double-shared plows or newly designed walking plows and modified old plows. The efficiency of potato digging is six to thirty times higher than manual digging, greatly accelerating the harvest speed. The sweet potato digging task force of twenty-five people's communes in Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, while rushing to harvest, also paid attention to the quality of the harvest, ensuring gentle lifting, gentle picking, gentle placing, gentle loading, and gentle transporting to avoid bumping, dropping, or crushing the sweet potatoes.

Timely processing of sweet potatoes is a critical task. To do this well, many regions have promptly dug potato wells and potato cellars, and promoted a large number of sweet potato processing tools. According to statistics from sixteen provinces and regions, including Henan, Anhui, Shandong, and Hebei, more than 1.95 million sweet potato slicing machines, shredding machines, and other tools have been promoted. Hebei Province has newly dug and expanded more than 1.09 million potato wells and potato cellars. Various regions have also prepared a large number of sweet potato drying kilns and drying furnaces, and trained a large number of sweet potato storage and processing technicians. In this way, many regions have achieved harvesting, storing, processing, and drying in a timely manner, avoiding or reducing losses.

Opening up new avenues for the utilization of the bumper sweet potato harvest is an issue that various regions are paying close attention to. Many regions have already built many processing plants.

    不丢一块薯　　不烂一块薯
    各地紧张收藏处理甘薯
    本报讯　收好、藏好、加工处理好获得空前大丰收的薯类作物，是各地突击三秋工作中的一项十分紧迫的战斗任务。这场战斗已在黄河和长江流域猛烈展开，南方各地也加紧了抢收的准备工作。
    今年全国薯类作物种植面积比去年扩大60％以上，达到二亿五千多万亩。目前，北方各地的马铃薯已经收完；黄河流域的甘薯已收30％左右；淮河和长江流域抢收甘薯的战斗也已展开；南方各地的抢收工作即将开始。已经收获的地区，大面积丰产田和高产“卫星”田不断出现。湖南省浏阳县红专人民公社一点零三亩甘薯地，放出了亩产五十六万七千五百七十斤的大“卫星”。
    今年甘薯生长的特点是：薯块大、扎的深、株距密、产量高，再加种植面积比往年扩大，因此，收获工作相当繁重。为了力争做到“一个不丢，一个不霉”，甘薯主要产区除较往年提早进行收获外，各地还在不误钢铁生产和秋耕秋种的前提下，组成抢收甘薯的专业大军，在田间安营下寨，日夜进行突击。很多地区为了作到适时收获，避免损失，采取很多办法，大挖劳力潜力和加速推广改良工具，加快了收获速度。山东省和河北省的河间县、四川省的西充、隆昌、苍溪等县大量推广了用双轮双铧犁或新式步犁、旧犁改装的畜力挖薯机，挖薯效率比用人工刨提高六倍到三十倍，大大加快了收获速度。江苏省宿迁县二十五个人民公社的挖薯专业大军，在突击抢收的同时，还注意了收获质量，作到轻起、轻摘、轻放、轻装、轻运，不碰伤、不摔伤、不压伤。
    及时对薯类进行加工是一项严重任务。为了做好这个工作，很多地区都及时地挖好了薯井、薯窖，推广了大量薯类加工工具。据河南、安徽、山东、河北等十六个省、区统计，已推广薯类切片机、切丝机等一百九十五万多台。河北省已新挖和扩修薯井、薯窖一百零九万多个。各地还准备了大量薯类烘干炕和烘干炉，训练了大批甘薯保管、加工的技术手。这样，很多地区就作到了随收、随藏、随加工、随烘干，避免或减少了损失。
    为丰收的甘薯开辟新的利用途径，是各地十分注意的问题。很多地区已经修建了许多加工厂。
