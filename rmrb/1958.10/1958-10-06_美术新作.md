New Art Works

All the works for our country's participation in the "Socialist Countries Fine Arts Exhibition" have been selected and will be exhibited in Beijing from October 6th to October 9th before being sent to Moscow. These more than 300 works were selected from more than 1,200 pieces sent to Beijing from all over the country. They include traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, sculptures, prints, cartoons, New Year pictures, propaganda posters, and comic strips. Some of them are outstanding works from the nine years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China; some are new works created by artists after they went to factories, rural areas, reservoirs, seaports, and other places to participate in labor and training in the past six months. These works vividly and specifically reflect the lives, labor, and struggles of the Chinese people from all aspects. In terms of artistic expression, the use of traditional forms to express real life is more naturally integrated than in the past, the style is more diverse, and the artistic skills have also been significantly improved. For example, "Everything for Steel" collectively created by artists in Nanjing, the long scroll "Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Displaying Their Unique Talents" collectively created by artists in Xi'an, Li Shuoqing's "Moving Mountains and Filling Valleys," and Guan Shanyue's "The Great Leap Forward Mountain Village" all timely reflect the thriving scene since the Great Leap Forward.

Only some of the new works are published here. This newspaper plans to introduce other works successively. (Pictures attached)

    美术新作
    我国参加“社会主义国家造型艺术展览会”的全部作品已评选完毕，并自10月6日——10月9日在北京先行展出，然后送往莫斯科。这三百多件作品是从全国各地选拔送京的一千二百多件中选出的。包括有国画、油画、雕塑、版画、漫画、年画、宣传画、连环画等，其中一部分是建国九年来的优秀作品；一部分是近半年来美术家们深入工厂、农村、水库、海港等参加劳动锻炼后的新作。这些作品从各个方面生动具体地反映了我国人民的生活、劳动与斗争。在艺术表现方面，运用传统的形式表现现实生活比过去结合得更加自然了，形式风格也更加多样，艺术技巧也有明显的提高。例如南京美术家们集体创作的“一切为了钢铁”、西安美术家们集体创作的长卷“群仙过海，各显神通”、李硕卿的“移山填谷”和关山月的“大跃进的山村”等等，都及时地表现了全民大跃进以来欣欣向荣的景象。
