Xinhua News Agency, 24th: London dispatch: The "Manchester Guardian" commented on the 21st on the resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, saying, "The obvious reason for the Chinese Communists' resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen is to show U.S. Secretary of State Dulles that they can do so whenever they like."

The commentary said that China's position "has not weakened in the slightest since they had not started the first bombardment."

The commentary said, "The losses to the United States are almost as obvious. Dulles's policies have neither been trusted by most of his allies nor supported by all of his compatriots. His policies are so embarrassing."

The "Scotsman" wrote in an editorial on the 22nd that the Chinese resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen shows that "they will probably stop and start as they please. For them, using Jinmen as a means of creating disputes between Chiang and the Americans and keeping the Formosa issue constantly hot is more valuable than Jinmen falling into their hands." The editorial said, "Dulles hopes that Chiang will withdraw from these islands," but "not only will Chiang not agree, but the Chinese Communists, in order to maintain pressure, will not give Dulles a chance to persuade Chiang Kai-shek without making it seem that Dulles is yielding to force – Dulles will not do this. If the United States could limit Chiang's rule to Formosa and the Pescadores (referring to Taiwan and Penghu), the two sides would in fact be separated, at most only shouting at each other. Neither Chiang nor the Chinese Communists want that."

The British newspaper said, "The Chinese Communists know that the entire argument for fighting for Jinmen will cause discord in the West, and they obviously want to keep it in an embarrassing situation." Therefore, "getting rid of Chiang Kai-shek and the truly absurd situation the United States is in regarding the Jinmen issue should be Mr. Dulles's overriding goal." And the United States "seems bound to have a showdown with Chiang Kai-shek, and the sooner the better."

### 英报议论我恢复炮击金门  中国要停就停要打就打  美国狼狈不堪脱身无法

    英报议论我恢复炮击金门
    中国要停就停要打就打
    美国狼狈不堪脱身无法
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：“曼彻斯特卫报”21日就中国人民解放军恢复炮击金门一事发表评论说，
  “中国共产党恢复炮击金门的明显原因是要向美国国务卿杜勒斯表明，只要他们喜欢这样做，他们就能够这样做。”
    评论说，中国方面“自从他们尚未开始第一次炮轰以来，他们的地位丝毫没有削弱”。
    评论说，“美国的损失几乎一样明显。杜勒斯的政策既没有得到他的大部分盟国的信任，也没有得到他的全体同胞的支持。他的政策是如此令人为难。”
    “苏格兰人报”22日的社论写道，中国人重新恢复炮轰金门一事表明“他们大概会停停打打。对他们来说，把金门作为一个使蒋和美国人发生纠纷和使福摩萨问题一直搞得火热的手段，要比金门落入他们手中更为有价值”。社论说，“杜勒斯希望蒋撤出这些岛屿”，但是，“不仅蒋不会同意，就是中国共产党人，由于要继续保持压力，也不让杜勒斯有机会来说服蒋介石，而同时又不使人觉得杜勒斯在向武力让步——杜勒斯是不会这样做的。如果美国能够把蒋的统治权限制在福摩萨和佩斯卡多尔岛（指台湾和澎湖），双方事实上将分隔开来，顶多只能互相空叫。蒋和中国共产党人都不希望那样。”
    这家英国报纸说，“中国共产党人知道为金门而战的整个主张，会在西方引起不和，他们显然希望把它保持在使人为难的境地中。”因此，“摆脱蒋介石使美国在金门问题上所处的真正荒唐的局面，应该是杜勒斯先生压倒一切的目标”。而美国“同蒋介石摊牌看来是少不了的，而且越快越好”。
