Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 8th: The Baotou Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has comprehensively completed its annual leap forward plan three months ahead of schedule, launching a high-yield "satellite" project in the construction industry.

As of the end of September, the engineering bureau had completed 101.4% of its annual construction and installation workload. In terms of quality, 89.5% of the projects reached first-class quality, and 10.1% reached second-class quality, basically eliminating third and fourth-class quality. Costs were reduced by 14% compared to the new quotas set in 1958. After National Day, the bureau's employees have already started working on the 1959 plan. They have decided to complete another quarter of the annual construction task before the end of the year.

The Baotou Engineering Bureau is responsible for the construction of important projects such as machinery and electricity at the Baotou heavy industrial base. This year's task is one and a half times greater than last year. In order to complete this arduous task, the Baotou Engineering Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party insisted on putting politics in command from the very beginning. Taking rectification and the general line as the guiding principles, they used extensive airing of views, big character posters, and debates to combine political movements with production. The entire bureau also implemented military-style organization, with employees organized into platoons, companies, battalions, and regiments according to their original structure. The engineering bureau was like a military division. A lively atmosphere emerged in the entire engineering bureau where everyone was a worker and mass movements were carried out in everything. Especially after the workers participated in management and implemented military-style organization, the workers faced their tasks with high morale, and many tasks were completed ahead of schedule.

Another important reason for the early completion of tasks by the Baotou Engineering Bureau was the vigorous development of technological revolution. Basic mechanization of all construction operations, bearingization of horizontal transportation, and mechanization of vertical transportation were basically achieved in three months. The workers and masses created and invented more than 1,300 tools, of which more than 500 have been used in production. Various units have manufactured more than 200 machines such as cranes, tampers, motors, blowers, electric welding machines, and ball mills. Among them, the electric plastering machine created by plasterer Liu Jingshan, and the electric bricklaying machine created by construction team leader Li Baoguang, increased work efficiency by several to dozens of times.

### 建筑业放出多快好省的大“卫星”  包头工程局完成全年计划

    建筑业放出多快好省的大“卫星”
    包头工程局完成全年计划
    据新华社包头8日电　建筑工程部包头工程局提前三个月全面完成全年跃进计划，在建筑业方面放出了一颗多快好省的大“卫星”。
    截至九月底，这个工程局已经完成全年建筑安装工作量101.4％；在质量方面，有89.5％的工程达到一等，10.1％的工程达到二等，基本上消灭了三、四等质量；成本比1958年新定额降低了14％。国庆节后，这个局的职工已开始作1959年的工作。他们决定在年底以前，再完成相当于全年四分之一的建筑任务。
    包头工程局承担着包头重工业基地的机械、电力等重要项目的建设，今年的任务比去年增加一倍半。为了完成这一艰巨的任务，中共包头工程局委员会一开始就坚持了政治挂帅。他们以整风和总路线为纲，运用大鸣、大放、大字报和大辩论，把政治运动和生产结合起来。全局还实行组织军事化，职工们按原来建制编成排、连、营、团，工程局就是一个兵师。全工程局出现了一种人人是劳动者、事事搞群众运动的活泼局面。特别是工人参加管理和实行组织军事化以后，工人们面对任务，斗志昂扬，许多任务都提前完成。
    包头工程局提前完成任务的另一重要原因，是大搞技术革命。三个月基本实现了全面施工机械化、水平运输轴承化、垂直运输机械化。职工群众创造发明的工具有一千三百多件，已用于生产的五百多件。各单位自制起重机、打夯机、马达、鼓风机、电焊机、球磨机等机器二百多台。其中，抹灰工刘景山创造的电动抹灰器，工区队长李保光创造的电动砌墙机等，都提高工效几倍到几十倍。
