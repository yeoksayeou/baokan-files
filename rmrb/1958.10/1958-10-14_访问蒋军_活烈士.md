    Visiting a Chiang Kai-shek "Living Martyr"
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Siyi

    At an air force base on the Fujian front, this reporter interviewed Chiang Kai-shek Lieutenant Pilot Zhang Naijun, who parachuted and was captured during the air battle on the morning of October 10th. This "martyr," whom Taiwanese newspapers boasted had "heroically sacrificed himself" to save his lead aircraft by colliding with our plane, is today sitting quietly in front of me, wearing the plain clothes issued to him by our air force.

    This Chiang Kai-shek pilot, who was fortunate enough to survive after his plane was shot down, still had lingering fears when talking to me about the air battle. That day, he was the wingman for Major Instructor Lu Jing of the squadron, and together with four other U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, they came to the mainland of Fujian to intrude. When he followed his lead aircraft into the mainland to carry out a sneak attack and encountered our aircraft formation, his lead aircraft hurriedly abandoned him, attempting to flee overseas. Zhang Naijun, in a panic, had not figured out what was happening when he suddenly felt a violent jolt to the fuselage, and the rear of the cockpit became hot and fiery, leaving him dazed. Zhang Naijun knew that his plane had been hit by our aircraft and hastily abandoned the plane, parachuting to escape. As soon as he landed, he was surrounded and captured by militiamen from all directions. When I told him that the Taiwanese newspapers had portrayed him as sacrificing himself to save his comrades, he smiled bitterly. Zhang Naijun honestly told me that before taking off, he was always thinking about whether he could return alive. Since our air force suddenly appeared over the Fujian area, a gloomy mood had spread among the Chiang Kai-shek pilots. Although Taiwanese newspapers were constantly touting "major air battle victories," the pilots knew better. An Air Force captain named Liu Guangcan in Zhang Naijun’s squadron did not return after flying over the mainland on August 14th. The squadron's lieutenant colonel deputy commander, Wang Mengquan, also almost lost his life in the air battle on August 7th, desperately flying his damaged plane back to Taiwan. These events are never mentioned in the Taiwanese newspapers. Zhang Naijun said: Although the Chiang Kai-shek clique uses high bonuses to lure pilots to the mainland to risk their lives, people are always afraid of death. Who would really want money more than life? The only effective measure left to maintain morale is the military law of shooting those who desert in the face of battle. Chiang Kai-shek's pilots don't know whether today or tomorrow will be their turn to die, so they all have a "eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die" attitude. When they get their pay, they go to restaurants, dance halls, see plays and movies, or fool around with girlfriends, living one day at a time. Can we rely on America? This question is increasingly being raised among the flight personnel in Taiwan. The arrogance of Americans in Taiwan often arouses the anger of Chiang Kai-shek's pilots. Zhang Naijun said that when Liu Ziran was beaten to death by U.S. Army Sergeant Reynolds, some Chiang Kai-shek pilots were filled with resentment at the Taiwan court's verdict of not guilty for Reynolds. At that time, all Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were placed under "leave restrictions," fearing that Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers would go out and cause trouble for the Americans.

    As the interview was about to end, Zhang Naijun told me that he was very frightened when he was first captured because his superiors had repeatedly warned their subordinates: "Captured by the communists, you will be skinned alive, have your head chopped off, and be buried alive." But after he was captured, he received lenient treatment, which made him wake up as if from a dream, feeling that he had been deceived in Taiwan all along.

    After hearing Minister Peng Dehuai's Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan, he sincerely hoped that the Taiwan authorities would not continue to be stubborn and that the affairs of the Chinese should be resolved by the Chinese themselves.

    访问蒋军“活烈士”
    新华社记者  周思义
    在福建前线某空军基地，记者访问了在10月10日早晨的空战中跳伞被俘的蒋军少尉飞行员张乃军。这个被台湾报纸，吹嘘成为为了援救长机不惜驾机同我机相撞，因而“壮烈成仁”的“烈士”，今天安静地坐在我的面前，他身上改穿了我空军部队发给他的便服。
    这个在飞机被击落以后，侥幸地保存了生命的蒋军飞行员，在向我谈到那次空战经过时，还心有余悸。那一天他充当了中队少校指导员路靖的僚机，和另外四架美制蒋机，一齐前来福建大陆上空窜扰，当他跟着他的长机伸入大陆进行偷袭遇到我机群迎击时，他的长机急忙甩掉了他，企图向海外飞逃，张乃军在慌忙中还没有弄清怎么一回事，突然感到机身猛烈一震，座舱后面热烘烘的起了火，被震得昏昏沉沉。张乃军知道他的飞机已被我机击中，仓忙地扔下飞机，跳伞逃生，一降落地面就被四面八方包围上来的民兵俘获了。当我告诉他台湾报纸把他说成是为援救战友而牺牲时，他苦笑了。张乃军老实告诉我，他在起飞以前，就老是想着能不能活着回去。从我空军部队突然出现在福建地区上空以后，一种灰溜溜的情绪就在蒋军飞行员中传播，尽管台湾报纸上成天大吹“空战大捷”，可是飞行员们心里有数。张乃军所在的大队一个名叫刘光灿的上尉飞行员8月14日飞到大陆上空窜扰后没有回来，这个大队的上校副大队长汪梦泉在8月7日的空战中也几乎丢了性命，狼狈地驾驶着被击伤的飞机逃回台湾。这些事，在台湾报纸上却从来不提。张乃军说：尽管蒋介石集团用高额奖金骗取飞行员们到大陆上空来卖命，可是人总是怕死的，谁真个会要钱不要命呢？剩下来维持军心的唯一有效措施便是临阵脱逃者枪毙的军法。蒋军飞行员们谁也不知道今天或者明天，轮到自己去送死，因此都抱着今朝有酒今朝醉的心情。发了饷就下馆子，上舞厅，看戏看电影，或者找女朋友鬼混，过一天算一天。靠美国靠得住吗？在台湾飞行人员中，这个疑问越来越增强了。美国人在台湾的横暴时常引起蒋军飞行员们的愤懑，张乃军说，在刘自然被美军上士雷诺打死事件发生时，有些蒋军飞行员对台湾法庭判处雷诺无罪蹩了一肚子气，当时蒋军中都一律“禁假”，怕蒋军官兵出去向美国人闹事。
    在访问快结束时，张乃军对我说他刚被俘时，曾经十分恐惧，因为他的长官们，一再告诫部属：“当了共军的俘虏要抽筋剥皮，砍头活埋”。可是他在被俘以后，受到宽大待遇，这使他如梦初醒，感到自己一直在台湾受了骗。
    他在听到彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书以后，衷心希望台湾当局不要再执迷不悟，中国人的事应该由中国人来解决。
