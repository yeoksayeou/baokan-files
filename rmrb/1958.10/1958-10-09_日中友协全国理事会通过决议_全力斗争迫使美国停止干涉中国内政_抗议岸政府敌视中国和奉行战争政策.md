Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japan-China Friendship Association, at an expanded meeting of its National Council held in Tokyo on the 7th, passed a resolution on the organization's current action policy and on "How to Promote the Japan-China Friendship Movement in the Tense Situation in the Taiwan Strait Region."

The resolution pointed out that forcing the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and forcing the Nobusuke Kishi government to sever all ties with the Chiang Kai-shek clique are not only the only way to break the current deadlock in Japan-China relations, but also the central issue for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

The resolution firmly stated that, in order to achieve the above goals, the Japan-China Friendship Association will stand at the forefront of the national movement to open up Japan-China relations and launch an all-out struggle.

The action policy adopted at the meeting stipulated that the Japan-China Friendship Association will vigorously promote the "Month for Stopping U.S. War Provocations in the Taiwan Strait Region and Promoting the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations" movement, which began in early September. During this movement, it will collect signatures of people who agree with the purpose of this movement, and also promote a movement for people to exchange letters with each other. After the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation currently visiting China returns home, it will also ask the representatives to hold report meetings in various parts of Japan.

The meeting unanimously passed a statement expressing extreme indignation at the Nobusuke Kishi government's condoning of thugs who insulted the Chinese flag in Yokohama.

The statement pointed out that at a time when the situation in the Taiwan Strait region is tense, this incident occurred in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, where many U.S. military bases are located, and it was not accidental. The statement solemnly pointed out that this is a concrete manifestation of the Nobusuke Kishi government's hostility towards China and pursuit of war policies.

The statement stated that the Association will vigorously promote the movement to strengthen Japan-China friendship in order to urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to change its anti-China policy.

The meeting also passed a letter of protest, protesting against the Japanese government's Minister of Justice and the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office for slandering a mentally ill patient named Fukutaro Ono, who recently returned from China, as having "suspicion of being a spy sent from China," illegally arresting him, and subjecting him to various persecutions. The letter of protest pointed out that this is a shameless act of repaying kindness with ingratitude towards China. The letter of protest demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government immediately release Ono and guarantee his future life.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association held an extraordinary general meeting on the 5th, and unanimously adopted the current action policy.

The policy stipulates that the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation will promote the movement in accordance with the policy adopted by the Japan-China Friendship Association's annual conference this year, support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan, oppose U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, and demand the abolition of the Japan-Chiang "treaty" and the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations.

    日中友协全国理事会通过决议
    全力斗争迫使美国停止干涉中国内政
    抗议岸政府敌视中国和奉行战争政策
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会7日在东京举行的全国理事会扩大会议上通过了这个组织当前的运动方针和关于“在台湾海峡地区形势紧张情况下如何推进日中友好运动”的决议。
    决议指出，迫使美国停止干涉中国内政和迫使岸信介政府断绝同蒋介石集团的一切关系，不仅是打开目前日中关系中存在的僵局的唯一途径，同时是为维护亚洲与世界和平的中心课题。
    决议坚决表示，日中友好协会为了实现上述目标，将站在打开日中关系国民运动的最前列，以全力展开斗争。
    会议通过的运动方针规定，日中友好协会将强有力地推进已经从9月初开始的“制止美国在台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅、促进恢复日中邦交月”运动，并且在开展这个运动期间征集赞同这项运动宗旨的人的签名，同时还要推进人民与人民之间互相交换信件的运动。等到正在中国访问的日中友好协会代表团回国以后，还将请代表们在日本各地举行报告会。
    会议一致通过一项声明，对岸信介政府纵容暴徒在横滨侮辱中国国旗的暴行表示万分愤慨。
    声明指出，在台湾海峡地区形势紧张的时候，这次事件发生在设有很多美军基地的神奈川县横滨市，并不是偶然的。声明严正指出，这是岸信介政府敌视中国和奉行战争政策的具体表现。
    声明表示，协会将全力推进加强日中友好的运动，以便促使岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策。
    会议还通过一项抗议书，抗议日本政府法务相和最高检察厅长官诬蔑不久以前从中国回国的一位名叫小野福太郎的精神病患者有“是从中国派来的间谍的嫌疑”，非法加以逮捕，并且对他进行种种迫害。抗议书指出，这是对中国以怨报德的无耻做法。抗议书要求岸信介政府立即释放小野，并且保障他今后的生活。
    日中友好协会东京都联合会在5日举行临时全体大会，一致通过了当前的运动方针。
    方针规定，东京都联合会将根据日中友好协会今年度大会通过的方针推进运动，支持中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的正义斗争，反对美国干涉中国内政，并且要求废除日蒋“条约”，恢复日中邦交。
