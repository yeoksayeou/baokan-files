    Red Flags Planted in Workers' Dormitories
    Wei Shulan, Director of the Family Committee of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory

    For days, I have been unable to calm down whenever I walk towards the workers' dormitories. It seems the trees along the roads are especially green, and the flowers are exceptionally red. Thinking about the changes in the residents of these dormitories in recent months, and their love for labor, mutual assistance, care for the collective, and the spirit of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me," I cannot suppress the excitement and joy in my heart.

    In the past, as soon as you entered the dormitories, you would see groups of three or five people gossiping and stirring up trouble. Sometimes, people argued so fiercely that the Family Committee had to mediate. One month, I personally mediated sixty-five disputes. However, since most family members participated in labor production, there hasn't been a single quarrel in the past three or four months. Couples happily go to work together; mothers-in-law bring meals to their daughters-in-law who are participating in production; elderly women who are not participating in production sweep the courtyards for neighbors who have no one to look after their homes...

    Granny Jin and her daughter-in-law, Gu Jingbo, used to be at odds, but now the mother and daughter-in-law are as close as a real mother and daughter. Gu Jingbo is studying at a technical school, and Granny Jin takes care of her child at home, often encouraging her to concentrate on learning techniques. After Ji Xinhua started working, her husband took meticulous care of her. In the past, housework was only Ji Xinhua's responsibility. After a quarrel, the woman had to wipe away her tears and serve her husband food. Now, her husband proactively shares some of the housework.

    The Zhang family and the Shao family in East Building 7 used to have disagreements and did not speak to each other for a long time. When the family members were setting up a canteen, the two families took the initiative to resolve their differences and moved into one house to live together harmoniously in order to free up housing for the canteen.

    These thousands of new people and new things all come from the soaring enthusiasm of the grandmothers and sisters to compete in labor and advance. For many years, many housewives have hoped to participate in work and contribute to national construction. However, many children, low education levels, heavy housework... in short: they couldn't leave the family. Now these problems have been solved. Everyone is no longer "anxious about doing housework; unable to unleash their enthusiasm!" Now, as soon as you enter the dormitory, you will hear people asking, "Sister, what job did you sign up for?" and others saying, "I must study technology well, and not let the male workers laugh at us women for being incompetent."

    Saying is not enough; everyone is really doing it. When the small alcohol factory was established, the weather was hot, but everyone was hauling lime and firewood, vying to be the first. Several people pulled a cart weighing thousands of pounds and ran. Two grandmothers with bound feet from the paper mill specially walked dozens of miles to Mixian County to learn techniques. Grandpa Deng was busy building coal fires for the public canteen and didn't sleep all night.

    Taking advantage of public property used to be commonplace. But now, when many people hear that factories are short of steel, they collect scrap copper and iron from their homes overnight and donate it. In one night, they collected over three thousand catties. To set up a public canteen, some sent pots and others sent jars; to set up a laundry, they sent wooden basins, irons, and washboards. They all said, "Only by running the collective affairs well can everyone have an iron rice bowl. Taking advantage of public property in the past was not only wrong, but also always had an end after taking and using it up."

    Love for the collective is also reflected in everyone consciously formulating and abiding by rules and regulations. Generally, housewives are relatively free and undisciplined in their lives. However, if everyone is still lazy and disorganized when working in the factory, production cannot be carried out. Therefore, everyone has stipulated work hours and learning and inspection systems, and they abide by them seriously.

    In the past few months, everyone has also felt that only by learning technology and culture and improving their ideological awareness can they work better. Many people are tirelessly studying, and some have even requested to join the Party and the League.

    I came to the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory in 1953 to do family work. In the past five years, although I have seen progress in the ideological awareness of family members, the pace has been very slow, and my work has always been difficult. I even thought: Dealing with family members all day long is really not promising. But today I no longer think so. I believe that as long as there is the leadership of the Party, as long as we trust the masses, any difficulties in work can be overcome, and socialist red flags can be planted everywhere.

### 职工宿舍里插上红旗

    职工宿舍里插上红旗
    郑州纺织机械厂家属委员会主任　魏淑兰
    好些天来，每当我走向职工宿舍去的时候，心里是那么不能平静。好像道路两旁的树木格外碧绿，鲜花分外艳红。一想到住在这一片宿舍里的主人们在最近几个月中的变化，和他们热爱劳动、互助互爱、关心集体以及我为人人，人人为我的情况，怎么也按捺不住我心里的兴奋和喜悦。
    过去，只要你一走进宿舍，就可以看到三人一堆、五人一群地在说东道西，挑是生非。有时候，人们吵的难解难分，只好由家属委员会来调解。有一个月，经我手调解的纠纷就有六十五起。可是，自从大部分家属参加劳动生产后，三、四个月来，一件吵架的事也没有。夫妇双双高高兴兴地一同去上班；婆婆给参加生产的媳妇送饭；没有参加生产的老大娘，就给无人看家的街坊扫庭院……。
    金大娘同儿媳妇顾静波过去不和，现在婆媳俩亲热的像亲妈和姑娘一样。顾静波在技术学校学习，金大娘在家给她抱孩子，还常常勉励她学习技术要专心。稽新华参加了工作后，她的丈夫对她体贴入微。过去，家务劳动只是稽新华一个人的事。两口子吵架后，女的擦干了眼泪就得去给男的端饭吃。现在她的丈夫主动地分担了一部分家务劳动。
    东七楼的张家和邵家，过去闹了意见长期不说话。在家属们办食堂的时候，两家为了给食堂腾房子，主动地解开了疙瘩，搬到一个房子里去和和气气地住在一起了。
    这千桩万桩新人新事，都是来自大娘和大嫂们的比劳动、比先进的冲天干劲。多少年来，许多家庭妇女们都希望参加工作，为国家建设出一份力。可是，孩子多、文化差、家务重……总而言之一句话：不能走出家庭。现在这些问题都解决了。大家不再是“搞家务，真心焦；有干劲，鼓不了”啦！现在，只要你一走进宿舍，你就会听见这里在问：“大嫂，你报的啥工作？”那里在说：“俺可要好好学技术，不要让男职工笑话咱们妇女不行。”
    说了还不算，大伙还真干。小酒精厂成立的时候，天气正热，可是大家拉石灰，运劈柴，人人争先恐后。千斤重的架子车，几个人拉起来就跑。造纸厂的两个小脚大娘，特地走了几十里山路到密县去学技术。邓大爷给公共食堂垒煤火忙的通宵没睡。
    占公家的便宜，过去也是习以为常。可是现在许多人一听说办工厂缺钢铁，就连夜搜集家里的废铜烂铁，捐献出来。一夜之间，就凑了三千来斤。要办公共食堂，送锅的送锅，送罐的送罐；要办洗染厂，就送木盆、熨斗和搓板。他们都说：“只有把集体的事情办好才是大家的铁饭碗。过去占公家的便宜，不光是不对，而且拿完用完，总有完了的一天。”
    热爱集体，还表现在大家自觉地制订和遵守制度，一般家庭妇女，生活上都比较自由散漫。可是大家在工厂作工，如果还是像过去那样懒懒散散，生产就没法办。所以大家都规定了上下班时间和学习、检查制度，而且认真遵守。
    几个月来，大家在劳动生产中还感到只有学习技术和文化，提高思想觉悟，才能更好地工作。许多人都在不倦地学习着，有的人还提出了入党、入团的要求。
    我从1953年到郑州纺织机械厂来作家属工作，五年来，虽然也看到家属们的思想觉悟有进步，但是，步子很缓慢，我的工作一直很难作。甚至我还想过：整天婆婆妈妈地和家属们打交道，真是没有前途。可是今天我再也不那么想了。我觉得只要有党的领导，只要相信群众，工作中的什么困难都可以克服，哪里都能够插上社会主义的红旗。
