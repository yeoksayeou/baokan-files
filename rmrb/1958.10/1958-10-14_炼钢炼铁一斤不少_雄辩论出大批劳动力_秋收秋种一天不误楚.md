Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th: In the face of heavy steel production, iron smelting tasks, and the urgency of the autumn harvest and planting season, Chu Xiong County in Yunnan Province, by strengthening political and ideological education and fully mobilizing the masses to tap potential, has solved the problem of labor shortage and achieved a double leap forward in both steelmaking and iron smelting and autumn harvesting and planting.

Beginning in late September, Chu Xiong County was in the most intense and critical stage of the great leap forward in the steel industry and the autumn harvest and planting. The two tasks were intertwined. Forty thousand mu of unharvested rice across the county were ripening simultaneously. The task of supporting the steel industry had to be completed on schedule. Out of the county's 88,800 male, female, and semi-able-bodied laborers, 43,000 were fixed on the agricultural production front. Recently, another 3,100 strong laborers were transferred from the agricultural production front to support steelmaking and iron smelting. In this situation, at this critical juncture, some people began to waver about the double leap forward. Some cadres and masses had three arguments. First, the "Steel Shut-Down Theory," saying, "In the past, it was elite troops fighting, now it's disabled soldiers harvesting." They advocated shutting down steel production. Second, the "Labor Shortage Theory," saying, "There are too many tasks, labor is tight, and autumn harvest and planting cannot be carried out." Third, the "Spillage Inevitable Theory," believing that "If we harvest quickly, we cannot harvest well, and grain spillage is inevitable." The Chu Xiong County Party Committee, with the help of the prefectural committee, carefully analyzed this situation and believed that the heavier the tasks, the more necessary it was to mobilize the masses, and it was essential to adhere to the double leap forward, grasping steel on one hand and autumn harvest and planting on the other.

The County Party Committee conducted a series of political and ideological education campaigns throughout the county, using methods such as extensive airing of views, big debates, establishing role models, on-site visits, and skill competitions to mobilize the masses and launch a mass self-education movement. The education content was: Three Oppositions, Two Reminiscences, and One Education. The Three Oppositions are: First, oppose the "Steel Shut-Down Theory." Through the current facts that various people's communes are asking to buy tractors, automobiles, new plows, etc., mobilize the masses for extensive airing of views and big debates. The masses believe that steel is the bone, steel is life, and steel is the lifeline of agricultural mechanization. They said, we have no cars, no tractors, foreign shovels need steel, big pots and shovels need steel, it won't work without steel. After the debate, those who supported the steel surge were extremely enthusiastic, and those who supported the steel shut-down were crestfallen. In the end, everyone unanimously stated that they would draw people from people, support whatever was needed, and be sure to greatly produce steel. Second, oppose the "Labor Shortage Theory." Everyone analyzed whether labor shortage was a good thing or a bad thing. They listed specific facts since the Great Leap Forward, explaining that great tension leads to great leap forward, small tension leads to small leap forward, and no tension leads to no leap forward. Labor shortage is a good thing, so their enthusiasm is very high. Third, oppose the "Spillage Inevitable Theory." The main method was to use comparisons of good and bad typical examples and organize on-site visits to prove that reducing spillage was entirely possible. At the same time, they recalled the situation of drought resistance, planting, and weeding in the previous period, recalled the lessons of last year's failure to increase production due to the late planting of small spring crops, and conducted international situation education for the masses. The masses responded one after another, saying that they would produce more steel and iron, harvest carefully and thresh carefully, and use the practical action of quick harvesting and quick threshing to counter the military provocations of US imperialism. The masses' enthusiasm for production was high, and everyone was willing to persist in hard work, grasping steel on one hand and autumn harvest and planting on the other, striving for a double bumper harvest of steel and grain.

On the basis of the masses' ideological improvement, the County Party Committee relied on the strength of the people's communes, fully utilized labor potential, broke with conventions, jumped out of the old circle of arranging and using labor according to the old methods, and carried out a county-wide labor force review, implementing the labor great collaboration of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers in one. Through the review and inspection, the county unearthed more than 16,000 full and semi-able-bodied laborers. At the same time, by implementing methods such as merging public canteens, nearly 7,000 people were saved. The county also organized about 1,800 cadres from government agencies, teachers and students from schools, and urban residents to participate in rushing to harvest and plant. Commercial personnel also moved small shops to the fields to support rushing to harvest and plant. In this way, the number of people working on the agricultural production front increased from more than 40,000 to more than 65,000, and the daily harvesting progress increased from 1,800 mu to more than 7,000 mu, with the highest daily progress reaching more than 11,000 mu.

While rushing to harvest and plant, the County Party Committee put forward the call for "equal emphasis on quality" and mobilized the masses to carry out field skill competitions. The masses in various places consciously formulated covenants for light cutting, light placement, and careful threshing, everyone worked hard, and everyone strived to be the first, greatly reducing spillage. More than 40,000 mu of rice were harvested in four days. By the end of September, more than 18,000 mu of wheat crops had been planted throughout the county, ensuring deep plowing and dense planting quality. The task of supporting steel production was also overfulfilled. (Attached picture)

### 炼钢炼铁一斤不少  雄辩论出大批劳动力  秋收秋种一天不误楚

    炼钢炼铁一斤不少
    雄辩论出大批劳动力
    秋收秋种一天不误楚
    新华社昆明13日电　云南楚雄县在钢铁生产、秋收秋种任务繁重和时间紧迫的情况下，用加强政治思想教育，充分发动群众挖掘潜力的办法，解决劳动力紧张问题，出现了炼钢炼铁和秋收秋种双双跃进的局面。
    楚雄县从9月下旬开始就处在钢铁工业大上马，秋收秋种最紧张的决战关头，两个任务交织在一起，全县四万亩未收的稻谷一齐成熟，支援钢铁工业的任务要定期完成，全县八万八千多个男女全半劳动力，固定在农业生产战线上的有四万三千人，最近又从农业生产战线上调出三千一百个精壮劳动力支援炼钢炼铁。在这种情况下，在这个决战关头，一些人对双跃进开始产生动摇情绪。部分干部和群众中有三种论点。一是“钢铁下马论”，“说过去是精兵勇将打仗，现在是残兵败将收割”，他们主张钢铁下马。二是“劳动力紧张论”，说“任务太多了，劳力紧张，秋收秋种无法进行”。三是“抛撒难免论”，认为“收快就不能收好，粮食抛撒在所难免”。中共楚雄县委在地委帮助下，认真分析了这种情况，认为任务越繁重，越要发动群众，必须坚持双跃进，一手抓钢铁，一手抓秋收秋种。
    县委在全县范围内进行了一系列的政治思想教育工作，用大鸣大放大辩论和树立典型、现场参观、比武等方式发动群众，掀起了一个群众自我教育运动。教育内容是：三反对，两回忆，一教育。三反对是：一反“钢铁下马论”。通过目前各人民公社要求购买拖拉机、汽车、新式犁等等事实，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论。群众认为，钢铁是骨头，钢铁是生命，钢铁是农业机械化的命根子。他们说，我们现在一没汽车，二没拖拉机，洋锹要钢铁，大锅大铲要钢铁，没有钢铁不行。经过辩论，钢铁上马论者情绪极为高涨，钢铁下马论者灰溜溜的，最后一致表示要人抽人，要什么支援什么，一定要大炼钢铁。二反“劳力紧张论”。大家分析了劳动力紧张是好事还是坏事，他们列举大跃进以来的具体事实，说明大紧张大跃进，小紧张小跃进，不紧张不跃进，劳动力紧张是好事，因此干劲很大。三反“抛撒难免论”。主要是运用好坏典型事例对比，组织现场参观，证明减少抛撒完全可能。与此同时，回忆了前一段抗旱、栽插、薅锄的情况，回忆了去年小春种迟不能增产的教训，并对群众进行国际形势教育。群众纷纷反映，要多出钢多出铁，细收细打，用快收快打的实际行动来回击美帝国主义的军事挑衅。群众生产情绪高涨，人人都愿坚持苦干，一手抓钢铁，一手抓秋收秋种，力争钢铁和粮食双丰收。
    在群众思想提高的基础上，县委依靠人民公社力量，充分发挥劳动潜力，打破常规，跳出按老办法安排使用劳动力的旧圈子，进行全县劳力大排队，实行了工农商学兵五位一体的劳动大协作。通过排队检查，全县共挖掘出全半劳动力一万六千多个，同时实行公共食堂合并等办法，节约出近七千人。全县又组织机关干部、学校师生、城镇居民约一千八百多人参加抢收抢种。商业人员也把小卖部搬到田间，支援抢收抢种。这样，农业生产战线上的出勤人数就由四万多人上升到六万五千多人，收割日进度由一千八百亩提高到七千多亩，最高日进度达到一万一千多亩。
    在抢收抢种的同时，县委提出“质量并重”的号召，发动群众开展田间大比武。各地群众纷纷自觉地订立了轻割、轻放、细打的公约，人人苦干，个个争先，抛撒大大减少。四天收完四万多亩稻子。到9月底止，全县种下小麦作物一万八千多亩，并保证了深耕密植质量。支援钢铁生产的任务也超额完成。（附图片）
