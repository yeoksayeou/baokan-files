The Henan Provincial Party Committee's "Zhongzhou Review" published in its fourth issue an article by Ji Wenfu entitled "'The Philosophical Significance of Combining Native and Foreign Methods.'" The article states that a prominent feature of the Great Leap Forward is the simultaneous use of native and foreign methods, and the combination of native and foreign techniques. A large number of native experts and various native methods are showing miracles one after another. This is a victory of the mass line, a victory of materialism, and a victory of dialectics.

Historical materialism shows us that the broad masses of working people are the true creators of history. Whether it is the creation of material wealth or the creation of spiritual wealth, in the final analysis, it cannot be separated from the practice of the working people. Is practice primary, or is theory primary? Is it relying on the masses, or is it relying on experts? This is a question of the struggle between the two paths of materialism and idealism. Originally, the so-called scientific theory is nothing more than summarizing past experiences gained from practice. Theory can guide practice, but practice constantly breaks through old theories and creates new theories. Practice, theory, re-practice, and then generate new theories, advancing repeatedly and endlessly, this is the dialectic of scientific development. After pointing out the dialectical relationship between native and foreign, the article says: Modern industrial machinery and equipment, have they not all gradually improved from the native tools used by past artisans? If it is said that large machines must be made with large machines, then how was the first large machine made? The article lists the recent facts that several young teachers and students of the Physics Department of Peking University used native methods to refine titanium and used native materials to make electrostatic accelerators, and concludes that: Replacing "foreign" with "native," and "native" generating "foreign," in this way, the "native" also becomes active, and the "foreign" also becomes active. Foreign experts often absorb some "native" air, which is beneficial to breaking the shackles of dogmatism and preventing the ossification of thought.

### 以土代洋、以土生洋  唯物辩证法的胜利

    以土代洋、以土生洋
    唯物辩证法的胜利
    河南省委主办的“中州评论”第四期刊载了嵇文甫的题为“‘土洋结合’的哲学意义”一文。文章说，大跃进有一个显著特点，就是土洋并举，土洋结合。大批土专家，各种各样的土办法，纷纷显示奇迹。这是群众路线的胜利，是唯物论的胜利，辩证法的胜利。
    历史唯物主义昭示我们，广大劳动人民才是历史的真正创造者。无论物质财富的创造，或精神财富的创造，归根结底，总离不开劳动人民的实践。实践第一呢，还是理论第一？依靠群众呢，还是依靠专家？这是唯物论和唯心论两条道路斗争的问题。本来，所谓科学理论，无非是把过去从实践中得来的经验加以总结。理论可以指导实践，而实践却时时突破旧理论，创造新理论。实践，理论，再实践，再产生新的理论，反复推进，以至无穷，这就是科学发展的辩证法。文章在指出土和洋的辩证关系之后说：近代大工业的机器设备，何尝不都是从过去手工业者所使用的土工具逐步改进而来。如果说大机器必须用大机器来制造，那末第一架大机器是怎样制造出来的呢？文章列举了最近北京大学物理系的几位青年教师和学生，用土法炼钛，用土材料制成静电加速器的事实，得出结论说：以“土”代“洋”，以“土”生“洋”，这样一来，“土”也活跃起来了，“洋”也活跃起来了。洋专家时常吸些“土”气，这对于打破教条主义的束缚，使思想不至于硬化，是有好处的。
