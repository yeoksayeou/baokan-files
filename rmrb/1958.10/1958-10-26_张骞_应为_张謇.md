    “Zhang Qian” should be “Zhang Jian”
    In Liu Danian's article "Sixty Years of the Reform Movement of 1898" on page 7 of the People's Daily on September 29th, there is a possible typesetting error. In the 18th line of the seventh paragraph in the first column of the article, "Zhang Qian was an industrialist," the "Zhang Qian" in the article should be "Zhang Jian." Zhang Qian was a great traveler who opened up communication between China and the West two thousand years ago. Zhang Jian, styled Jizhi, was from Nantong, Jiangsu. He founded many enterprises in Nantong, such as Dasheng Yarn Factory, salt reclamation companies, and power plants, and was an industrialist.

    “张骞”应为“张謇”
    9月29日人民日报第七版刘大年同志“戊戌变法六十年”一文，有一处想系误排。该文第一栏第七段第十八行“张骞是一个实业家”，文中“张骞”应为“张謇”。张骞是二千年前开辟中西交通的伟大旅行家。张謇字季直，江苏南通人，他在南通创办了大生纱厂、盐垦公司、发电厂等许多企业，是一个实业家。　北京国棉二厂　谢明明
