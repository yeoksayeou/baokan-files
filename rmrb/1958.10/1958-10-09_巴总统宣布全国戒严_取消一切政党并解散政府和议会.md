Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, October 8th: Pakistani President Mirza announced national martial law on the night of the 7th, and also announced the abolition of the Pakistani constitution and the dissolution of the central and provincial governments. The Pakistani National Assembly, and the East Pakistan and West Pakistan provincial legislative assemblies were also dissolved, and all political parties were abolished.

Mirza also appointed Pakistani Army Commander Ayub Khan as the person in charge of implementing martial law and placed all armed forces under his command.

After announcing the martial law, Mirza implemented military control. Pakistani soldiers wearing steel helmets have controlled key strongholds in Karachi and occupied most government departments, and armed patrols are guarding the streets of the city.

Ayub Khan announced in a statement that all newspapers, pending further orders, are prohibited from publishing comments on the martial law and other orders issued by the president.

Prior to the announcement of martial law, changes occurred in the Pakistani government. The Awami League, led by Suhrawardy, ordered its members participating in the government to withdraw from the government on the 7th, as a protest against Pakistani Prime Minister Noon's allocation of government member positions.

The Pakistani Central Government had added seven ministers on the 2nd, including five members of the Awami League, one member of the Congress Party, and one Republican. The Awami League had requested that three important ministerial positions be assigned to those within the Awami League who were instructed to participate in the central government.

    巴总统宣布全国戒严
    取消一切政党并解散政府和议会
    新华社卡拉奇8日电　巴基斯坦总统米尔扎在7日夜间宣布了全国戒严，并且宣布废除巴基斯坦的宪法，解散中央和各省省政府。巴基斯坦国民议会、东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦的省立法会议也被解散，所有的政党都被取消。
    米尔扎还任命巴基斯坦陆军司令阿尤布汗为执行戒严令的负责人，并且把所有的武装部队都交给他指挥。
    米尔扎在宣布戒严令以后，实行了军事管制。带着钢盔的巴基斯坦士兵已经控制了卡拉奇的重要据点和占领了大部分政府部门，武装巡逻队守卫着城内的街道。
    阿尤布汗在一项公告中宣布，所有的报纸在得到新的命令以前，都不得发表关于总统发布的戒严令和其他命令的评论。
    在戒严令宣布以前，巴基斯坦政府发生了变动。以苏拉瓦底为首的人民联盟7日命令它的参加政府的成员退出政府，作为对巴基斯坦总理努恩关于分派政府成员职务一事的抗议。
    巴基斯坦中央政府曾经在2日增加了七位部长，其中五名是人民联盟的盟员，一名是国大党人，一名共和党人。人民联盟曾经要求把三个重要部长的职位分派给人民联盟盟内受命参加中央政府的人。
