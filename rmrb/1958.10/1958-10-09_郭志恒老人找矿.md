After a rainstorm, the dark clouds in the sky dispersed, and the sun came out, shining brightly on the earth. At this moment, an old man with white hair and a vigorous spirit, Guo Zhiheng, stood in front of his door and laughed heartily, saying, "The weather is clear! It won't delay my going up the mountain to find treasure." He then shouldered his basket and picked up his iron pickaxe to go to the valley to look for minerals.

Guo Zhiheng had spent thirty years in the Helan Mountains of Ningxia. Thirty years ago, when Shanxi suffered from famine, he and his parents fled to Ningxia. They lived in Yinchuan for four years, and both of his parents died, leaving him alone to live a miserable and painful life. Later, he went to a village in the Helan Mountains called Hu'er Site to herd sheep for others. Thus, he spent more than twenty years of painful life in the mountains and fields. After liberation, he was allocated livestock and land and joined the agricultural cooperative, spending a happy old age.

Since the Pingluo County Committee proposed to vigorously develop industry and mobilize the masses to go up the mountains to find minerals, he has been more enthusiastic than anyone else. In addition to learning mineral exploration knowledge from the technicians of the 644 Geological Team, he went up the mountain to find minerals almost every day. One day in early July, he went alone to the top of a mountain forty miles away to find minerals. Suddenly, the sky was filled with dark clouds, followed by a rainstorm. However, old man Guo Zhiheng disregarded everything and climbed towards the mountain peak. Because the mountain was high and steep, the wind was strong, and the ground was slippery, he lost his footing and rolled down the mountain, all the way to a cliff more than thirty meters away. Fortunately, he was caught by trees. His clothes were torn, but he was not discouraged. He got up and continued to climb towards the mountain peak, finally reaching the summit. He saw a vast expanse of blue-green rocky cliffs shimmering with golden light. He was so happy that he forgot the pain of his injuries and began to pick up the ore. After 5:00 PM, old man Guo Zhiheng carried a basket of ore and happily returned to the 644 Geological Team. After testing by the geological team, it was confirmed to be copper ore. After further general survey by geological personnel, it was found to be a copper mine with significant mining value. Old man Guo Zhiheng was so excited that he shed tears.

Since finding the copper mine, old man Guo Zhiheng's enthusiasm has been even greater. Not only did he actively search for minerals himself, but he also mobilized the masses to go up the mountain to find minerals and led some herdsmen to the geological team to learn mineral exploration knowledge. Now, more than half of the people in Hu'er Site go up the mountain in groups every day to find minerals. Old man Guo Zhiheng also leads the herdsmen to run around in the valleys from morning till night every day. Recently, they found another small iron ore deposit with reserves of 20,000 tons. Currently, this deposit has been prepared and will soon be mined. Old man Guo Zhiheng's wishes will blossom and bear fruit on the mine. (Attached image)

    郭志恒老人找矿
    吴孝若
    一阵暴风雨过后，天空的乌云散了，太阳出来了，照耀得大地格外清晰美丽。这时，一个白发苍苍精神饱满的老人——郭志恒站在门前哈哈大笑地说：“天可晴了，又不耽误我上山找宝了。”他便背起筐子，拿起铁镐到山谷里找矿去了。
    郭志恒在宁夏贺兰山度过了三十年。远在三十年前，山西闹灾荒，他同父母逃荒到宁夏，在银川住了四年，父母都死了，他一个人过着凄惨痛苦的生活。后来到贺兰山里的一个村庄——胡尔斯台去给人牧羊。因此，在山野里度过二十多年的痛苦生活。解放后，他分得了牲畜和土地，加入了农牧业社，度过幸福的晚年。
    自从平罗县委提出要大办工业和发动群众上山找矿以后，他比谁的劲头都大，除了向六四四地质队的技术员学习找矿知识外，他几乎每天都上山找矿。7月上旬的一天，他独自一人到四十里外的一座大山顶上去找矿，突然间满天乌云，接着是一阵暴风雨，但郭志恒老人却不顾一切地向山峰上攀登。由于山高坡陡，风又大，地又滑，一步没留神，从山上滚了下去，一直滚到三十多公尺远的山崖上，幸亏被树木绊住了。衣服都被挂破了，但是他没有灰心。爬起来再继续向山峰爬，终于爬上了山顶。只见前面一片开阔的青蓝色的石崖上闪耀着金色的光芒，他高兴得忘记了身上伤痕的疼痛，就拣起矿石来。下午五点钟以后，郭志恒老人背着一筐子矿石，高高兴兴地回到六四四地质队，经地质队化验证明：是铜矿。后又经地质人员普查，是个很有开采价值的铜矿，郭志恒老人兴奋得流下眼泪。
    自从找到铜矿以后，郭志恒老人的干劲就更大了。不但他个人积极找矿，还发动群众上山找矿，并领着一些牧民到地质队学习找矿知识。现在胡尔斯台有半数以上的人，每天都成群结队上山找矿。郭志恒老人还领上牧民每天从早到晚在山谷里奔跑，最近又找到了储藏两万吨的小型铁矿一处。目前这个矿床已经搞好，即将进行开采。郭志恒老人的心愿将在矿上开花结果。（附图片）
