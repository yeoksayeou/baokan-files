    Argentine Peace Committee Issues Declaration
    Condemns U.S. Interference in China's Internal Affairs
    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, October 18th. The Argentine Peace Committee has issued a declaration condemning the U.S. interference in China, saying it carries the danger of provoking nuclear war.

    The declaration states that the presence of the U.S. Seventh Fleet off the Chinese coast violates the United Nations Charter and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Historically and legally, Taiwan, Jinmen and Mazu islands belong to China. Foreign armed interference has pushed the whole world to the brink of war.

    The declaration calls on the Argentine people to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Taiwan, Lebanon, and Jordan; to demand the prohibition of nuclear weapons and the implementation of complete disarmament; to demand the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with the People's Republic of China; and to support the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    The Argentine Peace Committee is currently conducting a month-long nationwide campaign against the threat of atomic war. In addition to issuing the aforementioned declaration, the committee has also published a notice that is currently being signed by people. At the same time, mass rallies have been held in clubs in Bahía Blanca and other cities.

    The Argentine delegates who participated in the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament and International Cooperation gave reports on the conference's decisions. In San Martin, the public decided to demand the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Taiwan region, and to demand that the government take the necessary emergency steps to promote a decision to halt nuclear testing.

    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯18日电
  阿根廷和平委员会发表了一项宣言，谴责美国对中国的干涉有引起核战争的危险。
    宣言说，美国第七舰队呆在中国海岸是违反联合国宪章和不干涉他国内政的原则的。在历史上和法律上，台湾、金门和马祖等岛屿都是属于中国的。外国的武装干涉已经把全世界推到战争的边缘。
    宣言号召阿根廷人民要求外国军队撤出台湾、黎巴嫩和约旦、要求禁止核武器和实行全面裁军，要求同中华人民共和国建立外交、经济和文化关系，支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。
    阿根廷和平委员会目前正在展开一个为期一月的反对原子战争威胁的全国性运动，这个委员会除了发表上述宣言外，还发表了一项正在由人们签名的公告。同时，在巴伊雷和其他城市中的各个俱乐部还举行了群众集会。
    参加斯德哥尔摩裁军和国际合作大会的阿根廷代表作了关于大会决定的报告。在圣马丁，公众决定要求美国军队立即撤出台湾地区，要求政府采取必要的紧急步骤来促使达成关于停止核试验的决定。
