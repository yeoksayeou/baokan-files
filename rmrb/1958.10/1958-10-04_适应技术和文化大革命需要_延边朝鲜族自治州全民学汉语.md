    To Adapt to the Needs of the Technological and Cultural Revolutions
    Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Launches Mass Mandarin Chinese Learning Movement
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Jin Changfan reports: A mass Mandarin Chinese learning movement is currently underway in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. The autonomous prefecture's radio station has begun broadcasting Mandarin Chinese and Korean language learning lectures, with the first lesson broadcast on September 3rd.
    This movement initially took shape among government officials this spring, when Korean cadres in various government offices universally adopted mastering Mandarin Chinese as a fundamental measure of being both "red" and "expert." A new atmosphere emerged where everyone was learning and speaking Mandarin Chinese. After half a year, many government offices at the autonomous prefecture and county levels can already hold meetings without interpreters, and the number of cadres directly studying from Chinese textbooks is increasing daily. At Yanbian Hospital, 70% of the Korean employees are attending part-time Mandarin Chinese universities, and over thirty doctors have already switched to writing medical records in Chinese. Influenced by them, even the less serious patients in the wards have organized mutual aid groups for learning ethnic languages. Recently, many government offices and schools in the autonomous prefecture have held rallies, determined to master Mandarin Chinese in the shortest possible time in order to "learn from the Han, catch up with the Han," and adapt to the needs of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. The four institutions of higher learning in Yanbian have decided to have 90% of the faculty switch to teaching in Mandarin Chinese within three months. Currently, more than 2,400 teachers and students from the four institutions are organizing cooperation and competitions to intensively study Mandarin Chinese.
    Currently, the upsurge in learning Mandarin Chinese has spread from government offices and schools to rural areas, factories, and mines throughout the prefecture. Illiteracy has already been eliminated throughout the prefecture, and some Korean farmers say: We must use the same vigor with which we eliminated Korean language illiteracy to eliminate Mandarin Chinese illiteracy.
    The formation of the mass ethnic language learning movement demonstrates that all ethnic groups in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have established new ethnic relations on the foundation of communist ideology. Through the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement, the vast number of cadres and masses have recognized that there have been some gaps between the ethnic groups in the past, mainly because a minority of Koreans, who constitute the majority in the autonomous prefecture, had a vague impression of the Han people, mistakenly believing that the Han were backward and the Koreans were superior. They did not recognize that the Han are the main ethnic group and the Han people's help to the minority ethnic groups. In practical work, they often overlooked or did not respect the Han people sufficiently. Consequently, a conservative and exclusionary tendency also arose on the issue of ethnic languages. Many people emphasized the "purification" of the Korean language, opposed absorbing new Chinese vocabulary, and even rejected learning Mandarin Chinese. Nationalists even openly attacked Korean cadres who spoke Mandarin Chinese, saying that they had "harmed national dignity," "betrayed their own ethnic group," and "become assimilated." After the rectification campaign and the socialist education movement, right and wrong were clarified, and the communist ideological consciousness was raised to an unprecedented level. Party and government departments at all levels also quickly improved past shortcomings, such as not paying enough attention to training Han cadres and developing Han schools, and strengthened ongoing ethnic unity education. As a result, righteousness is on the rise among the people of all ethnic groups, who are able to consciously respect the customs and habits of all ethnic groups, and cooperation between the ethnic groups has become closer. Not only can cadres of all ethnic groups mingle with each other in work, study, and life, but also joint ethnic amateur schools, clubs, public canteens, and kindergartens have appeared in many ethnic joint cooperatives. Thus, the idea of "learning from the advanced Han, catching up with the advanced level of the Han," and "strengthening the great unity of all ethnic groups with the Han as the center," has been further grasped by the majority of the Korean people, and a massive movement to learn the tool for common exchange of ideas among all ethnic groups—Mandarin Chinese—has emerged.

### 适应技术和文化大革命需要  延边朝鲜族自治州全民学汉语

    适应技术和文化大革命需要
    延边朝鲜族自治州全民学汉语
    本报讯　记者金昌范报道：延边朝鲜族自治州现正展开一个全民性的汉族语言学习运动。自治州广播电台开办汉语和朝鲜语学习广播讲座，在9月3日播送了第一课。
    这一运动是今春首先在机关干部中形成的，当时各机关朝鲜族干部普遍把掌握汉语作为红专的一项基本措施，出现了人人学汉语、人人讲汉语的新气象。经过半年，自治州和各县市一级许多机关已经可以开会不设翻译，直接用汉文书本进行学习的干部日益增多。延边医院有70％的朝鲜族职工上业余汉语大学，已有三十多名大夫改用汉文写病历，在他们的影响下连病房的轻患者也组织了民族语言学习互助组。最近，自治州许多机关和学校纷纷举行誓师大会，决心在最短期内精通汉语，以便“学汉族、赶汉族”，适应技术革命、文化革命的需要。延边四所高等院校已决定三个月达到90％的教员改用汉语讲课，现在四个院校二千四百多名师生正组织协作和竞赛，突击学习汉语。
    目前，学习汉族语言的高潮已由机关、学校遍及州内各地农村和厂矿。全州已经扫除了文盲，有的朝鲜族农民说：要以扫除朝鲜语文盲的干劲扫除汉语文盲。
    全民性民族语言学习运动的形成，说明延边朝鲜族自治州各民族已经在共产主义思想基础上，建立了新的民族关系。通过整风和社会主义教育运动，广大干部和群众认识到过去在各民族之间有过一些隔阂，最主要的是由于在自治州占多数的朝鲜族中少数人对汉族的印象淡薄，错误地认为汉族落后、朝鲜族优越，不认识汉族是主体民族和汉族对少数民族的帮助，在实际工作中对汉族也往往忽视或不够尊重。由此，在民族语言问题上也同样发生保守排外的倾向，不少人强调朝鲜语文“纯化”，反对吸取汉语新词汇，甚至排斥学习汉语。民族主义分子更公开攻击讲汉语的朝鲜族干部说：“伤害了民族尊严”、“背叛了本民族”和“被同化了”等。经过整风和社会主义教育运动，辩明了是非，共产主义思想觉悟空前提高；各级党政部门也迅速改进了过去培养汉族干部和发展汉族学校教育上不够重视等缺点，并加强了经常性的民族团结教育。从而，各族人民中正气上升，能够自觉地尊重各民族的风俗习惯，各民族之间的合作也更密切起来。不仅各族干部能够从工作、学习到生活上打成一片，在许多民族联合社里也出现了各民族联合的业余学校、俱乐部、公共食堂和幼儿园等。这样，“学习汉族的先进，赶上汉族先进水平”和“加强以汉族为中心的各民族大团结”的思想，进一步被多数朝鲜族人民所掌握，出现了声势浩大的学习共同交流各民族思想的工具——汉语的运动。
