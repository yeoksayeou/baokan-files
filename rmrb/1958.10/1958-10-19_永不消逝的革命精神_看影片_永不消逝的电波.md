    The Never Vanishing Revolutionary Spirit
    ——Watching the Film "The Eternal Wave"
    Lin Yuan
    Under the enemy's tight blockade and frantic suppression, what did the Party's underground organization rely on to obtain the Central Committee's instructions as quickly as possible in order to formulate its work plans? What did it rely on to break through the enemy's blockade to report work to the higher Party authorities and report various situations needed for the revolutionary struggle? What was it that suddenly shortened the vast distance between places as far apart as Yan'an and Shanghai?
    Without a doubt, it was the Party's secret radio station.
    The radio station was an important weapon for the Party to carry out its struggle in the White Area. Radio operators were soldiers standing on the front lines. The film "The Eternal Wave" depicts the heroic deeds and staunch qualities of this group of unsung heroes through the experience of a radio operator. An old Red Army soldier was sent to the enemy's heart – Shanghai – to be responsible for the Party's secret radio station work, enduring many hardships and persisting until the eve of Shanghai's liberation. From this, you can see how each of our victories was achieved? How much blood and sweat flowed in every process of our revolution? How did the outstanding sons and daughters of our Party demonstrate the communist spirit of "not being moved by poverty and humbleness, not being corrupted by wealth and status, and not being subdued by force" in their ordinary combat posts?
    "The Eternal Wave" is not like some thrillers that only focus on a specific event, attracting the reader's attention within a relatively narrow scope. The film unfolds its plot against a broad historical and social background. Through the activities of the radio operator and other underground Party members, it exposes the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to surrender and promotes the Party's policy of adhering to the War of Resistance Against Japan. It directly connects the Party's underground activities in Shanghai with the Party's headquarters. It connects Shanghai, occupied by the enemy, with the revolutionary sacred land of Yan'an. During the period of underground work, many comrades had such distress: they could not see the role of their work and always thought about going to the battlefield or the base area to fight a happy fight. The Party constantly criticized this wrong idea of ​​only looking at the part, not the whole, and only caring about personal pleasure, not the interests of the revolution. Look at it in the film, those underground Party members, they only do some ordinary work. For example, comrades who do traffic liaison work transmit the Party's secret instructions and documents without any mistakes. Maybe they don't even know the contents of these small notes, but they put their whole heart and whole life into this seemingly simple job. Who can say that any work is dispensable?
    They do ordinary work, they are unsung heroes (they never care about any "name"). No work is not a component of the entire revolutionary cause. A large machine cannot lack any small screws. This is a truth that the film "The Eternal Wave" tells us.
    This film also has an advantage: it pays attention to portraying the characters' personality and inner activities. The character of Li Xia, whether in his work post or under the enemy's cruel torture, demonstrated the noble qualities of a communist party member and a loyal underground worker. Under the enemy's whips, he did not confess a word, did not reveal a word of the Party, and he also used his own actions and silent eyes to spiritually support He Lanfen. When the enemy mistakenly thought that he was a "Chongqing element" and wanted to use him, he immediately did not miss this good opportunity to expose the enemy, even though the organization had decided that he should withdraw to the base area. Taking advantage of the opportunity to send secret telegrams for the enemy to obtain intelligence was very dangerous, but Li Xia only thought of the interests of the revolution and the needs of the revolution. Although, from the perspective of the plot arrangement, Li Xia's final sacrifice was not very necessary, because it was entirely possible to avoid it; moreover, the enemy had already noticed and was searching for this radio station. However, in order to complete the Party's task, the radio operator calmly went to implement it even though he knew there was great danger, without considering himself at all, which is very touching. The film ends when Li Xia sends the last set of code "Comrades, farewell, I miss you," making the audience resonate with this staunch voice in their hearts for a long time.
    Here, I would also like to say a detail. When He Lanfen was transferred from the factory to help Li Xia with his work, she was both excited and felt novel; but when she began to live a new life according to the requirements of the work, she was distressed. How could she not be distressed? In the factory, with her young sisters and her comrades, although the struggle was also very difficult, it was so enjoyable! Now, she has to wear cheongsams and play mahjong and say some boring things with those boss ladies and socialites she hates. But, as Li Xia said: "Since we are warriors of our own class, then we must learn to fight under any conditions!" The fact is exactly like this. Without clever concealment, without this perseverance and fighting spirit to learn to fight under any conditions, how could Li Xia's secret radio station have persisted in working for ten years? The description of this detail in the film makes everyone who has worked in the White Area feel intimate and interesting.
    I have not mentioned the shortcomings of the film (it still has some unrealistic details), but it is generally good. It can make us think about the past, look at the present, and create the future with greater drive and confidence. It can make us learn from the example of the revolutionary predecessors, maintain and carry forward the never-vanishing revolutionary spirit, and the never-vanishing communist red heart!

### 永不消逝的革命精神——看影片“永不消逝的电波”

    永不消逝的革命精神
    ——看影片“永不消逝的电波”
    林远
    在敌人的严密封锁和疯狂镇压下，党的地下组织依靠什么来最快地得到党中央的指示以便制定自己的工作计划呢？依靠什么冲破敌人的封锁向上级党汇报工作、汇报革命斗争所需要的各种情况呢？是什么东西使得像延安和上海这样遥远的距离一下子又缩得很近？
    没有疑问，是党的秘密电台。
    电台，是党在白区进行斗争的一个重要武器。电台的报务员，是站在最前线的战士。电影“永不消逝的电波”，就是通过一个电台报务员的经历，刻划了这群无名英雄们的丰功伟绩和坚贞品质。一个老红军，被派到敌人的心脏地区——上海去负责党的秘密电台工作，历尽许多艰险，一直坚持到上海解放的前夕。从这里，你可以看到，我们的每一个胜利是怎样得来的？我们的革命的每一个进程上，流过多少血，多少汗？我们党的优秀儿女，怎样在自己的平凡的战斗岗位上，表现了“贫贱不能移，富贵不能淫，威武不能屈”的共产主义精神。
    “永不消逝的电波”不像某一些惊险片，只是着眼在某一个具体事件，把读者的注意力吸引在比较狭仄的范围内。影片在广阔的时代背景和社会背景前展开它的情节。它通过电台报务员和其他地下党员的活动，揭露了蒋介石集团的投降阴谋，宣传了党的坚持抗日的方针。它把党在上海的地下活动同党的首脑部门直接地联系起来。把敌人占领下的上海同革命圣地延安联系起来。在地下工作时期，不少同志都曾经有过这样的苦闷：看不到自己工作的作用，老是想到战场上或者根据地去干个痛快。党不断地批判这种只看局部、不看全局，只顾个人痛快、不顾革命利益的错误想法。你从影片里看吧，那些地下党员，他们做的只是一些平凡的工作。例如，做交通联络工作的同志，他们百无一失地传递党的秘密指示和文件，也许他们根本还不知道这些小纸条的内容，但他们是把整个的心，整个的生命放在这项看来极简单的工作上的。谁能说哪件工作是可有可无的呢？
    他们做的是平凡的工作，他们是无名英雄（他们也从不计较什么“名”）。没有任何一项工作不是整个革命事业中的一个组成部分。一部大机器不能缺少任何一个小螺丝钉。这就是影片“永不消逝的电波”告诉我们的一个真理。
    这部影片还有一个优点：它注意刻划人物的性格和内心活动。李侠这个人物，无论在工作岗位上还是在敌人的严刑威逼下，都表现了一个共产党员、一个忠诚的地下工作者的高贵品质。在敌人的皮鞭底下，他没有招供一个字，没有泄露党的一句话，他还用自己的行动，用无言的眼神，在精神上支持了何兰芬。当敌人误认为他是“重庆分子”想加以利用的时候，他就立即不放过这个揭露敌人的好机会，虽然组织上已经决定他撤回根据地。利用替敌人发机密的电报的机会获得情报，这是十分危险的事，然而李侠想到的，只是革命的利益，革命的需要。虽然，从情节的安排上看，李侠最后的牺牲不太必要，因为完全有可能避免；而且，敌人已经注意而且正在搜索这个电台。但是，电台报务员为了完成党的任务，明知有极大危险也还是从容不迫地去执行，丝毫不考虑个人，这是很使人感动的。影片在李侠发出最后一组电码“同志们，永别了，我想念你们”的时候结束，使观众久久地在内心深处回响着这个坚贞的声音。
    在这里，我还想说一个细节。何兰芬从工厂里调出来帮助李侠工作时，她是又兴奋又感到新奇；可是当她开始按着工作的要求过新的生活的时候，她苦恼了。叫她怎不苦恼呢？在工厂里，同小姐妹一起，同自己的同志一起，虽然斗争也很艰苦，但是多么痛快！现在呢，要穿上花旗袍，同那些她所厌恶的老板娘、交际花之类打麻将，说些无聊话。可是，正像李侠讲的：“我们既然是自己阶级的战士，那就要学会在任何条件之下作战！”事实正是如此。如果没有巧妙的隐蔽，如果没有这种学会在任何条件下作战的毅力和斗志，李侠的秘密电台怎能坚持工作十年之久？影片的这个细节的描写，使每一个在白区工作过的人都感到亲切有味。
    我没有说到影片的缺点（它还有些不够真实的细节），它总的说来是好的。它可以使我们想想过去，看看现在，以更大的干劲和信心创造未来，它可以使我们学习革命前辈们的榜样，保持和发扬永不消逝的革命精神，永不消逝的共产主义的红心！
