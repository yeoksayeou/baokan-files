Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 5th October: The first coal mine in Tibet has officially been put into production. Lhasa, the ancient city that has used cow dung as its main fuel for thousands of years, has begun to burn locally sourced Tibetan coal for the first time in recent days.

The coal mine is located in the suburbs of Lhasa. It has coal reserves of approximately 700,000 tons and is anthracite, suitable for use as domestic fuel. The coal mine's planned annual production capacity can reach 20,000 tons, which can meet the coal needs of Lhasa's municipal organizations, military units, and residents.

This coal mine was discovered by the Tibetan Coalfield Exploration Team, and preparations for production were completed in less than two months. More than 1,000 Tibetan and Han cadres in Lhasa City used voluntary labor to build a road from the city center to the mine, ensuring the timely production of the coal mine and saving the state 60,000 yuan in funds.

    西藏建起煤矿
    拉萨可以不烧牛粪了
    新华社拉萨5日电　西藏境内的第一座煤矿已经正式投入生产。千百年来用牛粪作主要燃料的拉萨古城，这几天来，开始第一次烧到西藏本地的煤了。
    这座煤矿座落在拉萨近郊。煤储量约七十多万吨，是无烟煤，可作民用燃料。煤矿计划的每年生产能力可达二万吨，能解决拉萨市机关、部队和市民用煤的需要。
    这座煤矿是西藏煤田勘查队找到的，在不到两个月的时间里就作好了生产的准备工作。拉萨市一千多名藏、汉族干部用义务劳动修通了从市区到矿井的公路，保证了煤矿按时生产，为国家节约资金六万元。
