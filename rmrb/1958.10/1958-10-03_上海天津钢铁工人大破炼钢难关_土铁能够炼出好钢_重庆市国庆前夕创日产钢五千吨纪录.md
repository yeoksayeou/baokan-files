Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd - Steelworkers in Shanghai's various steel plants are tenaciously fighting harmful impurities like sulfur and phosphorus in miscellaneous iron and indigenous iron, achieving initial success in using inferior materials to produce high-quality steel. Starting in September, although the proportion of miscellaneous iron and indigenous iron used in steelmaking increased repeatedly, steel production in the first half of the month still increased by 3,500 tons compared to the same period last month.

Starting in mid-August, the raw materials used for steelmaking in Shanghai, such as pig iron from indigenous blast furnaces, scrap steel, and miscellaneous iron, which have complex compositions, gradually increased. The sulfur and phosphorus content in miscellaneous iron and indigenous iron is quite high, while the content of silicon and manganese, which are beneficial to steelmaking, is quite low. This situation brought great difficulties to the steelworkers. In order to turn all the scrap and miscellaneous iron and indigenous iron collected and smelted by the people with great effort into good steel, they learned from repeated failures and gradually accumulated experience in using miscellaneous iron and indigenous iron for steelmaking. Workers in the converter workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 seized on several heats of steel with excellent results, conducted on-site analysis, and summarized a set of operating methods for making standard slag and observing standard flames. As a result, starting in early September, the proportion of high sulfur content in various furnaces compared to scrap steel began to decrease, and the smelting time for each heat of steel also shortened day by day. The converter workshop of Plant No. 3 achieved a new record of one shift smelting seventy heats of steel, all of which were good steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd - Can indigenous iron be smelted into usable steel? This question has been basically resolved at the Tianjin Emerging Steel Plant. On September 30th, with the help of the technical working group for indigenous iron steelmaking of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the factory smelted usable rimmed steel using indigenous iron with an average sulfur content as high as 0.5% or more, without adding a single kilogram of ferrosilicon.

Pig iron with high sulfur and low silicon content is considered impossible to be smelted into steel. At present, many steel plants still have doubts and wait-and-see attitudes about whether indigenous iron can be smelted into steel.

In order to make steelmaking production better adapt to the requirements of the task, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry organized a technical working group led by the Iron and Steel Research Institute to cultivate "experimental fields" at the Emerging Steel Plant and jointly study and solve the problem of indigenous iron steelmaking with the workers of the Emerging Steel Plant. Under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and with the support and cooperation of the Party Committee Secretary and Director of the Emerging Steel Plant, the working group mobilized the masses, technical personnel, and workers to closely combine their efforts. In order to present a gift to National Day, after several days and nights of hard work, they adopted effective desulfurization measures and resolutely adopted methods of not using ferrosilicon and aluminum to increase the temperature of molten iron. Finally, on the eve of National Day, they launched a "satellite" of successful steelmaking using indigenous iron without ferrosilicon. They used 80% indigenous iron and 20% foreign iron to make steel. In order to achieve a large amount of desulfurization, an alkaline ironmaking furnace was used. According to test results, the desulfurization rate reached 50% to 70%; the ironmaking furnace also added a simple hot blast stove, which increased the past cold blast to about 180 degrees (it is estimated that the blast temperature can continue to increase to about 300 degrees), greatly increasing the temperature of molten iron. In converter operation, in order to increase the blowing temperature, the slag retention method was adopted, with three rows of tuyeres. Rapid steelmaking was also organized to shorten the stopping time, so as to reduce the heat loss of molten iron, molten steel, and the converter itself. Steelworkers and engineers also studied and developed a method of using 50% less lime in steelmaking slagging to save heat and implemented surface blowing operations to increase the temperature of molten steel. By adopting such a new operating system, they used low-silicon and high-sulfur indigenous iron to make rimmed steel. Now, the technical working group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the workers of the Emerging Steel Plant are full of enthusiasm and are studying how to further use all indigenous iron or reduce the proportion of foreign iron in steelmaking and strive to obtain a relatively complete experience in indigenous iron steelmaking at this factory to welcome the local steelmaking on-site promotion meeting to be held by the Ministry of Metallurgy in Tianjin on October 7th.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd - The hundreds of thousands of steelmaking troops in Chongqing created an unprecedented record of 5,010 tons of steel produced daily on the 30th. The city's open-hearth furnaces, electric furnaces, converters, and more than 2,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces were all started on this day, forming a climax of nationwide steelmaking, making the daily steel output 3.6 times higher than the average daily output in the first half of September.

The steelworkers of Chongqing participated in this battle with soaring enthusiasm. Several major steel plants achieved unprecedentedly excellent results on this day. The output of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company this day was more than 500 tons more than on the 29th.

The small converters and electric furnaces newly built by the city's machinery, electrical machinery manufacturing plants, mines, and chemical, textile, power, and construction enterprises all exerted their power on this day. Wangting Machine Factory and Chongqing Machine Factory alone produced more than 100 tons of steel. Steel flowers were also released next to office buildings, classrooms of schools, and courtyards of residents. Cadres, teachers, students, and residents throughout the city used the indigenous steelmaking furnaces they built to produce a total of more than 660 tons of steel. (Attached picture)

    上海天津钢铁工人大破炼钢难关
    土铁能够炼出好钢
    重庆市国庆前夕创日产钢五千吨纪录
    本报上海2日电　上海各个钢铁厂的职工，顽强地与杂铁、土铁里的有害杂质——硫、磷作斗争，取得用坏料炼好钢的初步成绩。9月份开始，各厂炼钢采用杂铁和土铁的比重虽然一再增加，但上半月的钢产量比上月同期仍然增长了三千五百吨。
    8月中旬开始，上海在炼钢用原料方面，成份复杂的土高炉生铁、废钢和杂铁逐渐增加。在杂铁和土铁里面硫和磷的含量相当高，而对炼钢有利的矽、锰含量却又相当低。这种情况给炼钢工人带来极大困难。为了把各地人民千辛万苦收集和炼出的废杂铁和土铁全部炼成好钢，他们从一次次失败中吸取教训，逐渐地积累起利用杂铁、土铁炼钢的经验。上钢三厂转炉车间的工人们抓住几炉冶炼成绩优异的钢，进行现场分析，总结出一套造标准碴、看标准火焰的操作法。这样，9月初开始，各个炉子硫高出废钢的比例开始有所降低，每炉钢的冶炼时间也一天比一天缩短。三厂转炉车间曾出现了一个班炼七十炉钢，炉炉都是好钢的新纪录。
    本报天津2日电　土铁是否能炼成可用的钢？这个问题在天津新兴钢厂基本上得到解决。9月30日这个工厂在冶金工业部土铁炼钢技术工作组的帮助下，用含硫量平均高达0.5％以上的土铁，在不加一公斤矽铁的条件下，炼成了合用的沸腾钢。
    高硫低矽的生铁是被人们认为不可能炼成钢的。目前，也还有很多的炼钢厂对于土铁是否能够炼成钢，抱着怀疑、观望的情绪。
    为着使炼钢生产更能适应任务的要求，冶金工业部组织了一个以钢铁研究院为主的技术工作组到新兴钢厂种“试验田”，和新兴钢厂的职工共同研究解决土铁炼钢的问题。这个工作组在中共河北省委、天津市委的领导下，和新兴钢厂党委书记和厂长的支持协作下，发动群众、技术人员和工人密切结合，为了向国庆献礼，经过几天几夜的苦战，采取了有效的脱硫措施，并且坚决采用不用矽铁和铝来提高铁水温度的方法，终于在国庆前夕放出了土铁不用矽铁炼钢成功的“卫星”。他们采用了80％土铁，20％洋铁来炼钢。为了达到大量脱硫的目的，改用了碱性化铁炉，根据试验结果，脱硫率达50％到70％；化铁炉还增加了简单的热风炉，使过去的冷风提高到一百八十度左右（估计风温尚可继续提高到三百度左右），使铁水温度大大提高。在转炉操作上，为了提高吹炼温度，采用了留碴法，三排风眼，并组织快速炼钢，缩短停歇时间，以减少铁水、钢水及转炉本身的热量损失。炼钢工人和工程师们还研究出在炼钢造碴时，少用石灰50％，以节约热量，并实行面吹操作，以提高钢水温度。在采用了这样一个新的操作制度，他们利用低矽高硫的土铁，炼成了沸腾钢。现在冶金工业部技术工作组和新兴钢厂的职工们干劲冲天，正研究进一步全用土铁或减少洋铁配比来炼钢，并且争取在这个工厂得到土铁炼钢比较完整的经验来迎接10月7日冶金部在天津召开的地方炼钢现场促进会。
    新华社重庆2日电　重庆几十万钢铁大军在30日创造了日产钢五千零一十吨的空前纪录。全市平炉、电炉、转炉和两千多座土炼钢炉，在这一天里一齐开动，形成了全民炼钢的高潮，使钢的日产量比9月上半月平均日产量猛增三点六倍。
    重庆全市钢铁工人以冲天的干劲参加了这场战斗。几个主要钢铁厂这天都出现了从来未有过的优异成绩。重庆钢铁公司这天的产量比29日多出了五百多吨。
    全市机械、电机制造厂，矿山和化工、纺织、电力、建筑等企业单位新建的小转炉、电炉，这一天都充分发挥了威力。仅望汀机器厂、重庆机器厂就炼出一百多吨钢。在机关办公室旁、学校的教室边和居民的庭院里，也都放出了钢花。全市干部、教师、学生、居民利用他们建设起来的土炼钢炉，一共炼出了六百六十多吨钢。（附图片）
