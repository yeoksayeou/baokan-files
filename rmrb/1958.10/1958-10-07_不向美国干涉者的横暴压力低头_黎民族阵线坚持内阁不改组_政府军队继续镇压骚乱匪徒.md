Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 6th - According to reports in local newspapers today, leaders of the Lebanese National Front, Salam, Yafi, Ueni, and Joonblatt, held talks with Prime Minister Karami yesterday to discuss new developments in the domestic situation.

    "Guangming Daily" quoted sources close to the Front as saying that all members of the National Front insisted on not reorganizing the Karami cabinet, nor increasing the number of ministers.

    President Shehab met with the leaders of the National Front, Salam, Yafi, Hamad, Assad, and Ueni, that evening to discuss the general situation of the recent provocations by Phalangists and National Socialists. Prime Minister Karami also attended the meeting.

    After the meeting, Salam issued a statement saying, "The purpose of this meeting is to discuss ways to dispel the clouds that have recently appeared over Lebanon and to destroy attempts to create sectarian warfare." He said that Shehab had decided to continue talks with leaders from all walks of life in the country.

    "Guangming Daily" said that Lebanese Maronite Archbishop Mayoush expressed great indignation yesterday at the recent provocative activities of the Phalangist party members. He also stated that he would cooperate with the current government.

    News from Beirut today said that the reactionary Chamoun clique, having failed to achieve its goal of participating in the cabinet, continued to carry out disruptive and provocative activities. Before dawn today, the reactionary Phalangists began to create disturbances in Beirut. They fired shots and threw bombs on the streets, threatening shops not to open for business. The rioters also re-blocked the road to the port, allowing only U.S. military vehicles to pass.

    Government troops opened fire to suppress the rioters. According to reports, one Phalangist was killed. On the Beirut-Damascus highway, the army also opened fire to disperse rioters to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Phalangists have been obstructing traffic there for the past few days and puncturing the tires of many vehicles trying to pass. The army has dispatched tanks and armored vehicles to the south of Beirut to guard the highway leading to the large southern city of Saida.

    According to a report in Damascus's "Banner Daily" on the 5th, the Lebanese Phalangists and traitors have reached an "agreement" with the American ambassador and Chamoun to launch a war so that the United States can intervene. The newspaper also said that the United States and Chamoun are trying to buy off some members of parliament to vote against the Karami cabinet in parliament. To this end, these members have already been paid tens of thousands of dollars.

    不向美国干涉者的横暴压力低头
    黎民族阵线坚持内阁不改组
    政府军队继续镇压骚乱匪徒
    新华社大马士革6日电　据今天此间报纸报道，黎巴嫩民族阵线的领导人萨拉姆、雅非、乌埃尼、琼卜拉特昨天同卡拉米总理举行会谈，讨论国内局势的新发展。
    “光明报”援引接近这个阵线的人士的话说，民族阵线的所有成员都坚持不改组卡拉米内阁，也不增加部长人数。
    谢哈布总统当天晚上会见了民族阵线的领袖萨拉姆、雅非、哈马德、阿萨德和乌埃尼，同他们讨论了长枪党和国家社会党徒最近挑衅的总的形势。卡拉米总理也出席了会议。
    会后，萨拉姆发表声明说，“举行这一会议是讨论驱除最近出现在黎巴嫩上空的乌云和摧毁制造教派战争企图的方法”。他说，谢哈布决定继续同国内各界领袖进行会谈。
    “光明报”说，黎巴嫩马龙派大主教迈乌什昨天对长枪党党徒最近的挑衅活动表示十分愤慨。他并表示要同现政府合作。
    今天来自贝鲁特的消息说，夏蒙反动集团由于没有达到参加内阁的目的，又继续进行破坏挑衅活动，今天天没亮，反动的长枪党徒就开始在贝鲁特制造骚乱。他们在街上开枪和扔炸弹，威胁商店不得开门营业。暴徒们还重新封锁通往港口的马路，只让美军车辆通过。
    政府军队开枪镇压暴徒，据报道，有一名长枪党徒被打死。在贝鲁特通往大马士革的公路上，军队也开枪驱散暴徒，以保证公路的畅通无阻。长枪党徒这几天来一直在那里阻碍交通，并且戳破了许多试图通过的车辆的轮胎。军队已经派坦克和装甲车到贝鲁特的南面，守卫通往南部大城赛伊达的公路。
    据大马士革“旗帜报”5日揭露，黎巴嫩的长枪党和卖国贼们已经同美国大使和夏蒙达成了“协议”，准备发动战争，以便美国能够插手干涉。这家报纸还说，美国和夏蒙正在设法收买一些议员，要他们在议会中投票反对卡拉米内阁。为此，已经付给这些议员成千上万的美元。
