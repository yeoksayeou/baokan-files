    Using the Abstract to Guide the Concrete, Starting from Practical Matters to Discuss Abstract Principles
    Philosophy Helps Chinese-Soviet Cooperative Farmers Solve Various Practical Problems
    Wen Shuiyuan, Li Yongzhong, Sang Zemin, Zhang Yuzhen

    Starting from June 1957, all party members of the Chinese-Soviet Cooperative Party Branch in Wuyuan Township, Tunchang County, Shanxi Province, began to study philosophy. By the beginning of October of the same year, on the basis of the victorious conclusion of the rectification campaign, a high tide of studying philosophy was launched among the broad masses.
    
        Distinguishing Between Two Types of Contradictions
    In the spring of 1957, an unhealthy trend swept through the Chinese-Soviet Cooperative, with landlords and rich peasants settling scores, and some well-to-do middle peasants agitating for grain and withdrawing from the cooperative. Under the influence of this unhealthy trend, a small number of poor and lower-middle peasants also had doubts and wavered about cooperation. Faced with this unhealthy trend, cooperative cadres showed three different attitudes. Production team leader Wu Luochun said, "Cooperation has gone too fast, and the unified purchase and sale is too rigid," and proposed the idea of "freedom to withdraw from the cooperative, grain must be supplied." Deputy Director Zhang Guisheng, regardless of the specific situation, advocated that all those who agitate for grain and withdraw from the cooperative should be dealt with by law. Party Branch Secretary Wang Guanfu, although able to distinguish between right and wrong on major issues, also seemed helpless due to long-term neglect of political theory study. Just when the masses could not distinguish the direction of the wind, and the cadres were in a dilemma, Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was officially published, and the branch immediately organized party members and cadres to study and discuss it seriously. Through study, they clearly realized that the situation they were facing contained two types of contradictions with different natures, namely, the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy and the contradiction among the people, and they also understood that the nature of the two types of contradictions was different, and the methods of solving them should also be different. Wu Luochun, who had previously shown serious right-leaning tendencies, said with deep remorse, "I spoke for the landlords and supported the rich peasants. Chairman Mao's article saved me." With the help of everyone, Deputy Director Zhang Guisheng also deeply realized that the contradictions among the people should not be handled with the methods used to treat the enemy. The township party secretary at this time repeatedly explained to everyone that Chairman Mao's article was a great philosophical work, and that all party members and cadres must strengthen their study in the future. After this, everyone unanimously requested to study philosophy. Therefore, the branch formed philosophy study groups with party small groups as units. Soon, the rectification campaign began.
      Understanding That Contradictions Can Be Transformed
    Through the rectification summary, the most profound experience everyone had was about the principle that contradictions can be transformed. Song Huocheng and 17 others in the cooperative were originally activists in the land reform, but they forgot their roots when it came to cooperation. After the realization of advanced cooperation in the whole cooperative, some people said, "Cooperation has sapped my strength, and unified purchase and sale has hurt my heart." Not only did they not work hard, but they also spoke ill of the cadres and undermined the cooperative with a small number of well-to-do middle peasants. Therefore, some cooperative members and cadres adopted discriminatory and exclusive attitudes towards them, saying that they were the scum of emancipated peasants and hopeless elements, and some even suggested sending them to the court for labor reform. During the rectification, with the sincere help and serious criticism of the broad masses, Song Huocheng and 17 others finally completely changed and returned to the embrace of the Party. Sure enough, in a month of water conservancy construction, 15 of the 18 people were rated as models. At this time, the cooperative cadres further realized the great role of the formula of unity-criticism-unity in resolving contradictions among the people. The broad masses also realized from vivid examples that backwardness can become advanced, negativity can become positive, and bad things can become good things.
    This made everyone deeply realize the great role of theory in solving practical problems. According to the urgent demands of the masses, the Party Branch decided to set up a peasant spare-time political school, combining production with the ideological situation of the members to launch a mass movement to study philosophy.
      Understanding Nature, Transforming Nature
    In the vigorous development of water conservancy, everyone learned the principle that as long as we can understand nature, we can transform nature. Last winter, the branch proposed to build a reservoir that could irrigate 200 mu of land. This plan was not large, but it caused a big dispute in the cooperative. Some said, "The mountains are high and the stones are thick, we can't do it. Our cooperative has no conditions for water conservancy construction. Since ancient times, there has only been one well. It is impossible to draw water up the mountain." Some people made such a "budget": "It is difficult to complete this project, and we still need great support from the state. We need 500,000 yuan, and 13,000 workers. The fastest completion will be in 1962." Their common conclusion was "it can't be done." Under these circumstances, the Party Branch believed that it was necessary to immediately give the members a philosophy lesson. So the philosophy teacher gave a lesson on "people can understand nature and transform nature", followed by a heated debate. After the debate, the majority of people had the confidence to complete the project.

    After more than 20 days of hard work, in addition to building two reservoirs that could irrigate 1,500 mu of land, they also built seven mountain-encircling canals and 41 wells, which could irrigate a total of 1,950 mu of land, making a mountainous cooperative that originally had no water basically realize water conservancy. In the face of the magnificent achievements, the broad masses fully understood the philosophical principle that "people can understand nature and transform nature", and also realized the truth that "things are done by people" and "man will conquer nature."
    
    Simultaneous Development of Industry and Agriculture, Mutual Promotion
    The law that things are interconnected was learned from the mass effort to run industry. This spring, in order to implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the Party Branch put forward a preliminary plan for running small factories at a general meeting of all members. Some people expressed their opposition on the spot. Their main "reasons" were: First, industry and agriculture should be strictly separated. "Cities run factories, rural areas produce more grain. The division of labor should be clear, and each industry should manage its own." Second, the cooperative is empty-handed, and it can't afford to do one thing, let alone two. The philosophy teacher seized on this issue and gave a dialectics lesson on the spot, focusing on explaining that things are not isolated, but interconnected. The cooperative running industry can promote agricultural production, and the development of agriculture can promote the development of industry.

    Through the lecture, most of the masses realized the correctness of the Party Central Committee's policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. Many people used the philosophical viewpoints they learned to powerfully criticize the above-mentioned two erroneous arguments. Party member Wang Sanrong said, "There are great benefits in the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. The countryside can also be urbanized. Cooperatives run factories, isn't it for crossing the Yangtze River as soon as possible?" Poor peasant Li Xiuhai said, "Since we can achieve cooperation, why can't we achieve industrialization?" He firmly stated that he would "listen to Chairman Mao and take the path of simultaneous development." Finally, everyone reached a consensus: walking on two legs is faster than walking on one leg, and the mass effort to run industry is the direction. After fifteen days of hard work, the cooperative built twelve new factories, including flour, fertilizer, farm tools, and sewing factories. Sure enough, the factories were run quickly, and agriculture was done well. The flour and sewing factories alone saved 150 women's labor for agriculture. The farm tool factory reformed 16 kinds of farm tools such as double-headed hoes and deep plows, and the labor efficiency was increased by more than two times. Deputy Director Zhang Guisheng, who was originally very worried that running industry would hinder the development of agriculture, said convincingly at this time, "The simultaneous development wins, and the single development fails. They promote each other and develop quickly. If these factories were not built, who would dare to guarantee a thousand catties of grain per mu." Everyone summarized the double leap forward in industry and agriculture as: "The result of simultaneous development is the victory of studying philosophy."

    以虚带实　就实务虚
    哲学帮助中苏社农民解决了各种实际问题
    温水源、李永忠、桑泽民、张玉珍
    从1957年6月起，山西屯长县吾元乡中苏社党支部全体党员开始学哲学。到同年10月初，在整风胜利结束的基础上，就掀起了广大群众学哲学的高潮。
        分清了两类矛盾
    1957年的春天，在中苏社刮起了一股歪风，地主、富农反攻倒算，部分富裕中农闹粮、退社。在这种歪风的影响下，少数贫农、下中农也对合作化产生了怀疑和动摇。在这种歪风面前，社干部表现出三种不同的态度。生产队长吴洛春说：“合作化就是走得太快了，统购统销统得太死啦”，并提出“退社自由，要粮必供”的主张。副主任张贵生则不分具体情况，主张凡是闹粮、退社的，都应一律法办。党支书王官福虽然能够分清大是大非，但由于长期忽视政治理论学习，也显得束手无策。正在群众辨不清风向，干部左右为难的时候，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”正式发表了，支部便立即组织党员干部进行认真的学习和讨论。通过学习，他们才明确认识到面临着的这种情况包含着两类性质不同的矛盾，即敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，也懂得了两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也应该不同。原来表现严重右倾的吴洛春沉痛地检讨说：“我替地主说了话，给富农撑了腰，毛主席的文章救了我。”在大家的帮助下，副主任张贵生也深刻地认识到对人民内部的矛盾不能用对待敌人的办法来处理。乡党委书记这时又给大家反复讲明毛主席的这篇文章是一篇伟大的哲学著作，今后全体党员干部必须加强学习。在这以后，大家就一致要求学哲学。于是，支部即以党的小组为单位组成哲学学习小组。不久，就开始了整风。
      懂得了矛盾可以转化
    经过整风总结，大家体会最深刻的是关于矛盾可以转化的道理。社里宋活成等十八人在土改中原是积极分子，到合作化时却忘了本。在全社实现高级合作化以后，有人却说：“合作化抽了我的筋，统购统销伤了我的心。”他们不但不好好劳动，还同少数富裕中农在一块说干部的坏话，拆合作社的台。因此，部分社员、干部对他们采取歧视、排斥的态度，说他们是翻身农民的败类，不可救药的分子，有的还建议把他们送法院实行劳动改造。整风中经过广大群众的真诚帮助和严肃批评，宋活成等十八人终于彻底转变，重新回到党的怀抱。果然，在一个月的水利建设中，十八人中就有十五人被评为模范。这时社干部才进一步认识到团结——批评——团结的公式对于解决人民内部矛盾的重大作用。广大群众也从生动的事例中认识到落后能变先进、消极能变积极、坏事能变好事的道理。
    这就使大家深深体会到理论对于解决实际问题的巨大作用。党支部根据群众的迫切要求，决定设立农民业余政治学校，结合生产，结合社员思想开展广大群众学哲学运动。
      认识自然，改造自然
    在大兴水利中，大家学到了只要能认识自然，就能改造自然的道理。去年冬天支部提出要修一个能浇二百亩土地的水库，这个计划本来不大，但在社里却引起了一场大争。有的说：“山高石厚不能干，兴修水利咱社没条件，自古到今一眼井，引水上山万不能。”有的人造了这样一笔“预算”：“完成这件工程难，还得国家大大支援，钱得五十万，用工一万三，竣工最快要到六二年。”他们的共同结论是“不能办”。在这种情况下，党支部认为有必要马上给社员上一次哲学课。于是哲学教员就讲了“人能认识自然，改造自然”的一课，紧接着便开展了一次热烈的鸣放辩论。辩论以后，多数人有完成这项工程的信心。
    经过二十多天的苦战。结果除修成能浇一千五百亩地的两个水库外，还建成了七条转山渠和四十一眼井，共能灌溉一千九百五十亩地，使一个原来没有一分水地的山区社，基本上实现了水利化。在宏伟的成绩面前，广大群众完全领会了“人能认识自然，改造自然”的哲学道理，也认识到“事在人为”、“人定胜天”的真理。
    工农业并举，相互促进
    事物是互相联系的这一条规律，是从全民大办工业中学懂的。今年春天，党支部为了贯彻工农业并举的方针，在全体社员大会上提出了举办小型工厂的初步方案。有些人当场表示反对。他们的主要“理由”：一是工农业应严格划清界限，“城市办工厂，农村多打粮，分工要明确，一行管一行。”二是合作社家底空，单举还举不起，那能顾得上双举呢？哲学教员抓住这个问题当场上了辩证法一课，着重讲解了事物不是孤立的，而是互相联系的，合作社办工业可以促进农业生产，农业的发展又可以促进工业发展。
    通过讲授，大部分群众认识到了党中央关于工农业并举方针的正确性。不少人用学到的哲学观点，有力地批判了上述两种错误论调。党员王三荣说：“工农业并举好处大，农村也能城市化，合作社办工厂，还不是为了早日过长江。”贫农李秀孩说：“我们既然能搞成合作化，为什么不能搞工业化？”他坚决表示要“听毛主席的话，走并举的路。”最后大家得出一致意见：两条腿走路比一条腿快，全民大办工业是方向。经过十五天的大战，全社新建起面粉、肥料、农具、缝纫等十二个厂。果然，工厂办得快，农业搞得好，光是面粉、缝纫两个厂就给农业节省出一百五十个妇女劳力，农具厂改制了双头锄、深耕犁等十六种农具，提高劳动效率都在两倍以上。原来很担心搞工业会妨碍农业发展的副主任张贵生这时口服心服地说：“双举胜利单举败，互相促进发展快，要不兴办这些厂，谁敢保证亩产千斤粮。”大家把工农业双跃进总结为：“并举的结果，学哲学的胜利。”
