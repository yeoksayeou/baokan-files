Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 27th. Immediately following the National On-site Conference on Thermal Power Equipment, the First Ministry of Machine Building held a National On-site Conference on Electric Motors in Shanghai from the 15th to the 25th. This conference focused on studying how the production of small and medium-sized electric motors can keep pace with power generation equipment and achieve high-speed development.

Since the beginning of this year, especially after the vigorous campaign to develop steel, the demand for small and medium-sized electric motors has greatly increased. Some small blast furnaces in some areas have everything ready except for electric motors, which has affected the leap forward in steel production. The machinery industry has also seen a large number of indigenous equipment and machine tools this year, and these equipment particularly need small motors under 100 kilowatts. It is expected that the demand for such equipment will increase significantly next year. This situation requires a major leap forward in the production of small and medium-sized electric motors.

The conference believed that the further development of small and medium-sized electric motor production currently requires solving three problems: insufficient equipment, insufficient raw materials, and insufficient personnel. The way to solve these problems is mainly to rely on self-reliance and do everything possible to arm ourselves. The specific policy is: In terms of equipment, we must mobilize the masses to build indigenous equipment and expand machining capacity. In terms of raw materials, we must take the conservation of raw materials, especially silicon steel sheets and copper wires, as an important task, and reduce consumption from all aspects such as product structure, process regulations, material management, waste recycling, and material substitution, and strive to make more products with the same amount of materials. On the issue of personnel training, on the one hand, old factories have the responsibility to help new factories with training, and on the other hand, new factories should also strive to solve the problem themselves. Provinces and regions that already have a foundation in the manufacture of small and medium-sized electric motors should solve the problem within the province.

Representatives from more than 20 units across the country introduced many valuable experiences at this conference. After the Beijing Xuanwu Electric Motor Factory started producing electric motors in the first half of this year, all employees worked together to make dozens of indigenous machines, improved the design of many products, and trial-produced the first cast iron motor in China. When the Xinxiang Electric Motor Factory in Henan started making small motors, they only had five or six people and four or five small machine tools. With very little equipment and materials, they worked hard for seven days and nights to produce seven 2.8-kilowatt small motors. Now this factory can produce more than 200 units a month. The Chongqing Changjiang Electric Factory did not have silicon steel sheets or electromagnetic wires for producing electric motors. They made their own silicon steel sheets and electromagnetic wires, which met the needs of production. This factory will not only be able to meet its own needs next year but will also be able to support other factories.

This conference particularly emphasized that small and medium-sized electric motors must pay attention to improving product quality. In order to rapidly improve the manufacturing technology level of small and medium-sized electric motor factories in various regions, the conference decided to establish a large technical collaboration network across the country, centered on eight old factories, and these old factories would hold regular regional meetings to exchange experiences. In addition, six factories and units in Shanghai, Dalian, Harbin, and Jiamusi were designated to be responsible for providing technical data to electric motor factories across the country to help factories in various regions technically.

Three hundred and eighty-five representatives attended this conference, coming from 217 factories, enterprises, and scientific research units across the country.

    莫叫高炉等电机
    一机部为大造电动机找到门径
    新华社上海27日电　紧接着全国火力发电设备现场会议以后，第一机械工业部15日到25日又在上海召开全国电动机现场会议。这个会议集中研究了在中小型电动机方面的生产如何和发电设备比翼齐飞，高速度发展的问题。
    今年以来，特别是大搞钢铁以后，中小型电动机的需要量大大增加。有些地区的小高炉，万事具备，独缺电机，以致影响钢铁的跃进；机械工业今年也出现了大批土设备、土机床，这些设备特别需要一百瓩以下的小电机。可以预料，明年这种设备的需要量还将大大增加。这种形势，要求中小型电动机的生产必须来一个大跃进。
    会议认为，当前中小型电动机生产的进一步发展，首先要解决设备不够、原料不足、人员不多三个问题。解决这些问题的途径，主要是自力更生，千方百计地依靠自己武装自己。具体方针是：在设备方面，必须发动群众，大造土设备，扩大机械加工能力。在原料方面，必须把原材料特别是矽钢片、铜线等原料的节约作为一项重要的任务，从产品结构、工艺规程、物资管理、废料回收、材料代用等各方面减少消耗，力求用同样多的材料做出更多的产品。在人员培训问题上，一方面老厂有责任帮助新厂大力培训，另一方面新厂也要力求自己解决。在一些中小型电动机制造方面已有基础的省区，应该在省内自己解决。
    各地二十多个单位的代表在这次会议上介绍了许多宝贵的经验。北京宣武电机厂今年上半年开始生产电动机以后，全厂职工一齐动手，制成了几十台土机器，改进了许多产品的设计，并且试制出了国内第一台铸铁电机。河南新乡电机厂开始做小电机时，只有五、六个人和四、五台小机床，他们在设备、资料都很少的情况下，苦干了七昼夜，制成了七台二点八瓩的小电机。现在这个厂一个月已经能够生产二百多台了。重庆长江电工厂生产电动机没有矽钢片、电磁线。他们自己动手轧矽钢片做电磁线，满足了生产的需要。这个厂明年不但可以满足本厂需要，还可以支援其他工厂。
    这次会议特别强调中小型电动机必须注意提高产品质量。为了迅速提高各地区中小型电动机工厂的制造技术水平，会议决定在全国以八个老厂为中心，建立一个技术大协作网，由这些老厂定期分地区召开会议交流经验。另外，还指定上海、大连、哈尔滨、佳木斯等六个工厂单位，负责提供全国电机厂技术资料，从技术上帮助各地工厂。
    参加这次会议的代表有三百八十五人，他们来自全国二百一十七个工厂企业和科学研究单位。
