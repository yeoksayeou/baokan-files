Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 16th: The 1958 Autumn Chinese Export Commodities Fair, jointly sponsored by fifteen trade groups from various Chinese foreign trade corporations, opened on the 15th.

    At the fair on the 15th, transactions in just six hours amounted to over 804,000 pounds sterling (equivalent to over 5.5 million yuan), an increase of approximately 40% compared to the average daily transaction volume of last year's Autumn Fair. Today's transactions included machinery, minerals, instruments, small native products, silk, and more.

    On the evening of the 15th, the Chinese Export Commodities Fair held an opening reception. Wei Jinfei, Director of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair and Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, spoke at the reception. He said: This fair is the largest in scale and has the most exhibits of any fair held in Guangzhou since 1957. From the large number of new commodities exhibited at this fair, one can get a general overview of the vigorous economic development and improved technological level of our country in recent years.

    Wei Jinfei then pointed out: The Chinese government has consistently adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Chinese government and people have always advocated establishing and developing trade relations with any country in the world on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit, regardless of its social system or whether it has diplomatic relations with our country.

    Jiang Ming, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, also spoke at the reception. He said: Our country currently has trade relations with ninety-four countries and regions. Based on the common desire to develop our respective independent and autonomous economies and promote world peace, as well as the principle of equality and mutual benefit, our country's trade and economic cooperation with Asian and African nationalist countries has greatly developed this year and will be further developed and consolidated in the future. Our trade with Western countries has also further developed. However, due to the fact that some Western countries are following the lead of U.S. imperialism in adopting discriminatory trade policies towards our country and have not yet completely removed the unpopular "embargo," this seriously affects the normal development of trade between our country and these countries. Some Western countries hope that trade discrimination and "embargoes" can hinder our country's industrial and agricultural production and construction; however, contrary to their wishes, our country's economic construction has developed more self-reliantly, while their economic crises have deepened. Jiang Ming continued: Currently, U.S. imperialism is constantly carrying out military provocations and threats of war against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, plotting to expand its aggression against our country. This adventurous action by U.S. imperialism seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world, and also threatens trade relations between all countries in the world and our country.

    Jiang Ming concluded: It is very clear to everyone that normal international trade helps promote world peace, and only world peace can guarantee the continuous development of normal international trade. Therefore, the Chinese people are willing to work together with all peace-loving people in the world to smash the U.S. imperialists' war threats and military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, and to develop normal international trade.

    More than 1,000 people attended the opening reception, including businessmen and guests from more than 20 countries and regions such as Burma, Indonesia, Iraq, Cambodia, Canada, West Germany, Ceylon, Denmark, and the United Kingdom, as well as Hong Kong and Macau who came to participate in the fair, and heads of various Chinese trade groups.

    The fair is scheduled to last for a month and a half. In addition to trading our country's export commodities, we will also import some materials necessary for our country's industrial and agricultural production and construction. (Attached picture)

    秋季出口商品交易会开幕
    新华社广州16日电　中国各对外贸易公司组成的十五个交易团联合主办的1958年秋季中国出口商品交易会15日开幕。
    在15日的交易会上，仅六小时即成交八十万四千多英镑（折合人民币五百五十多万元），比去年秋季交易会平均每天成交额增加40％左右。今天成交的有机械、矿产、仪器、小土产、丝绸等。
    15日晚上，中国出口商品交易会举行了开幕式酒会。中国出口商品交易会主任委员、广东省副省长魏今非在会上讲了话。他说：这次交易会是在1957年以来在广州举行的交易会中规模较大展品较多的一次。从这次交易会所展出的大量新商品中，可以概略地看到我国近年来经济蓬勃发展和技术水平提高的面貌。
    魏今非接着指出：中国政府一贯遵循着和平共处的五项原则，中国政府和人民一向主张在互相尊重主权和平等互利的基础上，愿同世界上任何一个国家建立和发展贸易关系，无论它的社会制度如何，也不论它同我国有无外交关系。
    中华人民共和国对外贸易部副部长江明也在酒会上讲了话。他说：我国目前已经同九十四个国家和地区有了贸易关系。基于发展各自独立自主的经济和促进世界和平的共同愿望以及平等互利的原则，我国今年同亚非民族主义国家的贸易和经济合作，有了很大的发展，今后并将更加发展和巩固。我国同西方国家的贸易往来，也有了进一步发展。但是，由于某些西方国家追随美帝国主义，对我国采取贸易歧视政策，同时还没有全部撤除不得人心的“禁运”，这严重地影响了我国和这些国家贸易的正常发展。西方某些国家指望贸易歧视和“禁运”可以阻碍我国工农业生产建设；然而，同它们的愿望相反，我国经济建设更加自力更生地发展了，而它们的经济危机却更加加深了。江明接着说：目前，美帝国主义正在台湾海峡地区不断地对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，阴谋扩大对我国的侵略。美帝国主义这种冒险行动，严重地威胁了亚洲和世界和平，也威胁着世界各国同我国贸易往来。
    江明最后说：人们都十分清楚，国际间的正常贸易有助于促进世界和平，同时只有世界和平才能保证国际间正常贸易的不断发展。因此，中国人民愿意和世界各国一切爱好和平的人士一起，为粉碎美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行战争威胁和军事挑衅，为维护亚洲和世界和平，为发展国际间的正常贸易而共同努力。
    出席开幕式酒会的有缅甸、印度尼西亚、伊拉克、柬埔寨、加拿大、西德、锡兰、丹麦、英国等二十多个国家和地区与香港、澳门前来参加交易会的商人、来宾，我国各交易团负责人等，共一千多人。
    交易会预定举行一个半月。除交易我国出口商品外，还要进口某些为我国工农业生产建设所必需的一些物资。（附图片）
