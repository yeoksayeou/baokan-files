Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. The Japanese Socialist Party released a research report on the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" on the 24th. The report pointed out that the Kishida Nobusuke government's police law amendment is unconstitutional.

The research report pointed out that the Japanese constitution stipulates that the basic rights of the people shall not be infringed upon, but the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" stipulates that these rights will depend on the "judgment" of the police, which poses the danger of infringing upon these basic rights in the name of "public safety and order."

The report believes that Articles 3, 4, and 5 of this amendment infringe upon the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, freedom of assembly, association, speech, etc., and the right of solidarity and collective bargaining of the working people, as stipulated in the constitution. Because Article 2 of the amendment strengthens the provision that the police can conduct interrogation according to their authority, this violates the clause in the constitution that "no arrest can be made without an arrest warrant." Because Article 3 of the amendment stipulates that the police can implement "protection," there is a danger of making arrests in the name of "protection"; due to detention or seizure, the individual property rights stipulated in the constitution will be infringed upon. Article 6 of the amendment stipulates that the police can enter some places, so the police can arbitrarily intrude into residences, search and confiscate possessions. However, the constitution stipulates that legal procedures are required when taking the above actions.

### 日本社会党发表研究报告  指责警察法修正案违宪

    日本社会党发表研究报告
    指责警察法修正案违宪
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本社会党24日发表了对“警察官职务执行法修正案”的研究报告。报告指出，岸信介政府的这个警察法修正案是违反宪法的。
    这个研究报告指出，日本的宪法规定着国民的基本权利不受侵犯，但是“警察官职务执行法修正案”规定这些权利将取决于警察的“判断”，这就有以“公共安全和秩序”为名来侵犯这些基本权利的危险。
    报告认为，这个修正案的第三、四、五条侵犯了宪法中规定的个人的生命、自由、追求幸福的权利，集会、结社、言论等自由，以及劳动人民的团结权、集体谈判权等。由于修正案第二条加强了警察可以根据职权实行盘问的规定，这就违反了宪法中规定的“没有逮捕命令就不能逮捕”的条款。由于修正案第三条规定警察可以实行“保护”，就有以“保护”为名进行逮捕的危险；由于拘留或者扣押，宪法规定的个人财产权将会受到侵犯。修正案第六条规定警察可以进入一些地方，这样，警察可以随意侵入住宅，搜查和没收所持的物品。但是宪法规定在采取上述行动的时候需要有法律的手续。
