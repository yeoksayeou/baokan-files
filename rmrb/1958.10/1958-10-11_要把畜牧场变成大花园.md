To Turn the Livestock Farm into a Big Garden

“Today’s youth surpasses hundreds of generations,” and young people should also do extraordinary things in the Great Leap Forward. The youngsters of Baofu Township in Daxing District, Beijing, are always thinking about what they can do. After discussion, they felt that in addition to supporting the Red Pioneer Reservoir, everyone liked raising livestock, and it would be great to have a livestock farm. The youngsters and their counselors discussed it with the township Party committee, which strongly supported their initiative and decided to give them seventy mu of land to run a livestock farm, named "Red Pioneer Livestock Farm."

When they heard this news, they were truly happy. They immediately organized a farm management committee, elected a small farm manager, and issued a call to all members: donate two bricks, one stick, and one tile each. The members responded enthusiastically to this call and, in a very short time, collected 2,048 bricks, 29 cubic meters of half-bricks, 330 wooden sticks and small poles, 477 tiles, and 35 yuan in cash. In mid-May, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. All 1,600 Young Pioneers in the township first built a five-foot-high, three-foot-wide earthen wall around the livestock farm, with a length of three li. Then they built roads inside the farm, built six offices, built three pigsties, and dug a two-mu fish pond. Now they have planted fifty mu of corn and are raising sixty-three pigs.

Currently, they are actively building the livestock farm, planning to raise 615 pigs, 20 milk goats, 5 dairy cows, 361 chickens, 361 ducks, 5,000 fish, 6 beehives, and plant 460 fruit trees and 6 grape trellises by the end of this year. They plan to build the livestock farm to be like a big garden.

    要把畜牧场变成大花园
    “今朝少年胜百代”，少年也要在大跃进中做出不平凡的事情来。北京市大兴区宝福乡的少年们老想着他们能干哪些事情。经过大家讨论，认为除去支援红领巾水库以外，大家都喜欢饲养，如果搞一个畜牧场可就太好了。少年们和辅导员一起找乡党委商量，乡党委非常支持他们的倡议，并且决定给他们七十亩地办一个畜牧场，命名为“红领巾畜牧场”。
    当他们听到这个消息时真是高兴极了，他们马上就组织了办场委员会，选出小场长，并且向全体队员发出号召：每人捐二块砖一根棍、一片瓦，队员们积极响应了这个号召，在很短时间内就集中了二千零四十八块砖，半头砖二十九方，木棍小杆三百三十根，瓦四百七十七块，现款三十五元。5月中旬，举行了开工典礼，全乡的一千六百名少先队员首先在畜牧场的周围打起了高五尺宽三尺的土围墙，长度足有三里地。接着又在场内修公路，修了六间办公室，盖了猪圈三所，挖了一个二亩大的养鱼池。现在他们已种了五十亩玉米，养猪六十三口。
    目前他们正在积极建设畜牧场，计划到今年底养猪六百一十五口，养奶羊二十只，养奶牛五头，养鸡三百六十一只，养鸭三百六十一只，养鱼五千条，养蜂六箱，种果木树四百六十棵，葡萄六架。他们准备把畜牧场建设得像大花园一样。
