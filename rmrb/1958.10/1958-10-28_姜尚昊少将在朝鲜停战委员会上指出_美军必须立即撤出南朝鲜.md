Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, October 27th. At a meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission today, convened at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side, Chief Korean-Chinese Commissioner Jiang Shanghao informed the US side that the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from Korea in order to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and demanded that the US side immediately respond to the proactive measures of the Korean-Chinese side and immediately withdraw all foreign troops, including US troops, from South Korea.

Major General Jiang Shanghao spoke first at the meeting. He said that according to the decision announced in the statement issued on February 20, 1958, by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers in response to the joint statement of the governments of Korea and China on February 19, 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from Korea in three batches from March 15, 1958, to October 26, 1958. The representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Military Armistice Commission will remain to continue to carry out the task of supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement together with the representatives of the Korean People's Army.

Jiang Shanghao pointed out that the historically significant fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea vividly illustrates that our side has consistently and strictly abided by the armistice agreement since the armistice, and has strived to lead the armistice towards a consolidated peace. It also shows that we are acting entirely in accordance with the relevant clauses and spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. This once again shows the world that our side has taken important proactive measures to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease tensions in the Far East.

General Jiang Shanghao further pointed out that the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has actually opened a new and decisive stage in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Based on the unanimous desire of all the Korean people, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued an important historical statement on February 5 this year to realize the peaceful resolution of Korea and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, proposing that the United States troops and all foreign troops, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, withdraw from Korea simultaneously, and that free elections be held throughout Korea for a certain period after the withdrawal of foreign troops to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers fully support and endorse the statements issued by the governments of Korea and China on this issue, and accept the proposal of the Government of the People's Republic of China to proactively withdraw from Korea before the end of this year, and have already implemented this decision. This action by the Chinese People's Volunteers once again demonstrates to the world their position of helping the Korean people and fighting for peace and justice.

Jiang Shanghao said, however, that your actions have been the opposite. US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee gang have stubbornly rejected the legitimate proposals of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, opposed the peaceful reunification of Korea, advocated "unification by force," and planned to permanently station troops in South Korea. At the same time, your side continues to pursue a policy of war, transporting atomic weapons into South Korea and building missile bases. Your actions are the fundamental cause of the suffering of the South Korean people and the national misfortune of the Korean people, and the only obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Jiang Shanghao said that today, with the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, your side has no reason or excuse to refuse to withdraw from South Korea. Now, all the Korean people and the people of the world warmly support and praise the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and unanimously demand that all foreign troops, including the United States troops, immediately get out of South Korea. If your side disregards the unanimous demands of all the Korean people and the just public opinion of the world and continues to remain in South Korea, then the people of the world will see more clearly that it is your side that has consistently obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea; they will also hate and condemn even more the mortal enemy of the Korean people, the saboteur of peace, and the aggressor US imperialism. At the same time, they will never allow the United States troops to continue to be stationed in South Korea and will surely drive them out.

In order to continue to implement its war policy, obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and evade the responsibility of withdrawing troops from South Korea, the US side groundlessly rejected the Korean-Chinese side's demand for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, and claimed that the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea was not within the jurisdiction of the Military Armistice Commission. In order to extricate itself from its untenable predicament, the US representative raised the issue of the return of the defecting South Korean civil airliner, which had long been refuted by the Korean-Chinese side, in an attempt to shift the focus.

Major General Jiang Shanghao sternly refuted the various absurd arguments of the US side at the meeting. He pointed out that only under the condition of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea is it possible to lead the Korean armistice towards a consolidated peace and achieve a final resolution of the Korean issue. This is the basic task of the Korean armistice. Why can't the Military Armistice Commission discuss the basic tasks required by the armistice?

Jiang Shanghao said that today, your side disregards the unanimous demands of all the Korean people and the people of the world and refuses to withdraw your aggressive troops from South Korea, which adds a shameful page to the history of American crimes full of aggression and plunder. The American imperialists have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean people. Your side must immediately withdraw your aggressive troops from South Korea, otherwise, your side will once again expose your true colors as an aggressor to the world and will incur the serious consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, October 27th. Major General Jiang Shanghao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, said at a press conference held after the conclusion of the Military Armistice Commission meeting today that, through today's meeting, people can see the two completely different attitudes taken by the Korean-Chinese side and the US side towards the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He said that the Korean-Chinese side has consistently and faithfully fulfilled the armistice agreement. The Chinese People's Volunteers have taken proactive measures for peace and have completely withdrawn from northern Korea. This clearly shows the peaceful sincerity of the Korean-Chinese side. However, the US side refused to withdraw its aggressive troops from South Korea at today's meeting. This shows that it has no sincerity at all in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and attempts to continue to implement its aggressive policy and war policy.

Major General Ren Rong, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, said to reporters at the meeting that the major action of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea not only opened a new and realistic path for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also greatly contributed to easing tensions in the Far East and the world. The Chinese People's Volunteers came to Korea eight years ago to maintain peace and stop aggression, and now they are withdrawing from Korea for peace and to promote the early realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is a major contribution to the entire cause of peace. He said, however, that the US side shamelessly refused to withdraw its aggressive troops from South Korea without any reason, continued to adhere to its war policy, and turned South Korea into its military base and colony, as a springboard for launching new wars.

He said that the US side's stubborn refusal to withdraw its aggressive troops in South Korea once again shows the world that it is the US side that is obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea; it is also the US side that is creating tensions. Therefore, the American aggressors will be severely condemned by the countries and people of the world, and will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.

Major General Ren Rong said that the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers remaining in the Military Armistice Commission will continue to work unremittingly with the representatives of the Korean People's Army to supervise the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

    姜尚昊少将在朝鲜停战委员会上指出
    美军必须立即撤出南朝鲜
    志愿军撤出朝鲜开辟了和平解决朝鲜问题新阶段
    美国公然拒绝撤军再一次暴露它侵略者的真面目
    新华社板门店27日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会在朝中方面建议下今天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊在会上通知美方：中国人民志愿军为了促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，已经全部撤出朝鲜，要求美方立即响应朝中方面的主动措施，把包括美军在内的一切外国军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    姜尚昊少将在会上首先发言。他说，根据中国人民志愿军总部为响应朝中两国政府1958年2月19日的联合声明而在1958年2月20日发表的声明中宣布的决定，中国人民志愿军已经在1958年3月15日到1958年10月26日分三批全部撤出朝鲜。军事停战委员会中的中国人民志愿军方面的代表仍将留下，同朝鲜人民军代表一起继续执行监督朝鲜停战协定实施的任务。
    姜尚昊指出，中国人民志愿军已经全部撤出朝鲜这一有历史意义的事实，生动地说明了我方自从停战以来始终一贯地严格遵守停战协定，并且努力把停战导向巩固的和平，而且表明我们是完全按照朝鲜停战协定中关于一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的有关条款和精神办事的。这再一次向全世界表明了我方为和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势采取了重要的主动措施。
    姜尚昊将军又指出，同时中国人民志愿军的全部撤出朝鲜实际上开辟了和平解决朝鲜问题的一个新的决定性的阶段。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府根据全朝鲜人民的一致愿望，在今年2月5日曾发表了一篇实现朝鲜和平和祖国和平统一的具有历史意义的重要声明，建议美国军队和包括中国人民志愿军在内的一切外国军队同时撤出朝鲜，并且在外国军队撤出后的一定时期内实行全朝鲜的自由选举，以实现朝鲜的和平统一。中国人民志愿军完全支持并赞同朝中两国政府就这个问题发表的声明，并且接受中华人民共和国政府的建议，决定在今年年底以前主动撤出朝鲜，并且已经实现了这个决定。中国人民志愿军的这种行动再一次向全世界表明了他们帮助朝鲜人民并且一直为和平和正义进行斗争的立场。
    姜尚昊说，但是，你方的行为却一直相反，美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮蛮横地拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的正当建议，反对和平统一朝鲜，主张“武力统一”，并且策划永久驻扎在南朝鲜。同时，你方继续推行战争政策，把原子武器运入南朝鲜，并建立导弹基地。你方的这种行动是南朝鲜人民的痛苦和朝鲜人民的民族不幸的根本原因，并且是妨碍朝鲜和平统一的唯一障碍。
    姜尚昊说，在中国人民志愿军已全部撤出朝鲜的今天，你方没有任何理由和借口再拒绝撤出南朝鲜。现在，全朝鲜人民和全世界人民都热烈支持和赞扬中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜这一行动，一致要求包括美国军队在内的一切外国军队立即滚出南朝鲜。如果你方不顾全朝鲜人民和全世界公正舆论的一致要求，继续留在南朝鲜，那么，全世界人民将看得更清楚，始终一贯阻挠和平统一朝鲜的就是你方；他们也将更加憎恨和谴责朝鲜人民的死敌、和平的捣乱者和侵略者美帝国主义。同时，他们决不允许美国军队继续驻扎在南朝鲜，一定要把他们赶出去。
    美方为了继续执行它的战争政策，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，逃避从南朝鲜撤军的责任，毫无理由地拒绝朝中方面要美军撤出南朝鲜的主张，并说什么外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题不属于军事停战委员会的职权范围以内。美方代表为了摆脱理屈词穷的困境，又提出了早已被朝中方面驳倒了的要求朝中方面归还起义的南朝鲜民航机的问题，企图转移中心。
    姜尚昊少将在会上严正驳斥了美方的种种荒谬论调。他指出，只有在从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的条件下才有可能把朝鲜停战导向巩固的和平，使朝鲜问题获得最后的解决。朝鲜停战的基本任务就在于此。军事停战委员会为什么不能讨论停战所要求的基本任务呢？
    姜尚昊说，今天你方不顾全朝鲜人民和全世界人民的一致要求，拒绝从南朝鲜撤出你方的侵略军队，这就在充满着侵略和掠夺记录的美国罪恶历史上增加了可耻的一页。美帝国主义者没有任何权利干涉朝鲜人民的内政。你方必须立即把你方的侵略军队撤出南朝鲜，如若不然，你方就将再一次向全世界暴露你方的侵略者的真面目，并将招致由此而产生的严重后果。
    新华社板门店27日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将今天在军事停战委员会会议结束以后举行的记者招待会上说，通过今天的会议，人们可以看出朝中方面和美方对于朝鲜问题和平解决所采取的截然不同的两种态度。他说，朝中方面一贯忠实地履行停战协定。中国人民志愿军为了和平已经采取主动措施，全部撤出了朝鲜北部。这清楚地表明了朝中方面的和平诚意。但是美方在今天的会上却拒绝从南朝鲜撤出它的侵略军队。这说明它对和平解决朝鲜问题根本没有诚意，企图继续执行它的侵略政策和战争政策。
    中国人民志愿军代表任荣少将在会上对记者说，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜的重大行动，不仅为朝鲜问题的和平解决开辟了新的现实的途径，而且大大有利于缓和远东和世界紧张局势。中国人民志愿军在八年前为了维护和平制止侵略而来到朝鲜，现在又为了和平和促使朝鲜和平统一的早日实现而撤离朝鲜。这是对整个和平事业的重大贡献。他说，但是美方却毫无理由地厚着脸皮拒绝从南朝鲜撤出它的侵略军队，继续坚持战争政策，把南朝鲜变为它的军事基地和殖民地，作为它发动新战争的跳板。
    他说，美方顽固地拒绝撤退它在南朝鲜的侵略军队，这就向全世界再一次说明，阻挠朝鲜和平统一的是美方；制造紧张局势的也是美方。因此，美国侵略者将受到全世界的国家和人民的严正谴责，也必将遭到可耻的失败。
    任荣少将说，留在军事停战委员会内的中国人民志愿军代表，今后将同朝鲜人民军代表一起，为监督朝鲜停战协定的实施而继续不懈地努力。
