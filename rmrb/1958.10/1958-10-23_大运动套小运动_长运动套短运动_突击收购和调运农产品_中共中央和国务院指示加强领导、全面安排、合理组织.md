Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Emergency instructions from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council regarding the urgent completion of agricultural product procurement and transportation tasks.

    This year, China's agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, which has greatly encouraged the broad masses of people. However, the current procurement and transportation of agricultural products have not been completed satisfactorily. The agricultural products that should be purchased have not been purchased nearly enough; many of the agricultural products that have been purchased have not been transported out; and the supply of agricultural products in some cities and industrial and mining areas has already become strained. This situation must be changed immediately.

    Recently, the people of the whole country have been vigorously developing steel production while also vigorously engaging in autumn harvesting, autumn storage, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Under these circumstances, the slower pace of procurement and the untimely transportation are completely understandable and normal. The nature of the tension this year is fundamentally different from that of previous years. In previous years, the problem was the insufficient products; this year, the products are available, but they have not been collected. After the establishment of the people's communes, unified allocation of labor has been implemented, which can further tap potential, improve efficiency, and accomplish more with the same amount of effort. This is entirely feasible. The problem lies in whether there is careful planning. If something is not arranged, no one may do it; conversely, if something is arranged, it can be guaranteed to be completed through everyone's efforts. Fully understanding and mastering this characteristic, and better leveraging the advantages of the people's communes, various tasks, including the procurement and transportation of agricultural products, can be completed satisfactorily.

    Recently, some localities have adopted methods of comprehensive planning, division of labor among secretaries, organizing specialized teams, launching separate shock efforts, and assigning responsibilities by area. While vigorously developing steel production and engaging in autumn plowing and planting, they have integrated procurement and transportation with autumn harvesting, autumn storage, and preliminary processing of agricultural products, completing everything in one go. They are taking advantage of every available opportunity and interval, and according to the harvest situation of different crops, they are launching phased and batch-by-batch shock purchases and shock transportation. This approach has already yielded significant results.

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council believe that, under the current circumstances, the procurement and transportation of agricultural products must mobilize the masses, combining shock purchases with regular purchases, and shock transportation with regular transportation. While vigorously developing steel production and vigorously engaging in agriculture, insert procurement and transportation campaigns, big movements within small movements, long movements within short movements. The harvest of agricultural products itself has a very large shock nature. After the autumn harvest, there are still many important tasks that need to be freed up to complete. The procurement and transportation of agricultural products must also be implemented with shock efforts and must involve mass movements. Although the labor force is relatively tight at present, there is still potential; not everyone who can work has fully utilized their strength, and the labor force of not every unit is well organized. The key lies in strengthening leadership, comprehensive planning, and rational organization.

    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council require all localities to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the procurement and transportation of agricultural products. They require the use of every interval, the organization of all forces that can be organized, and the completion of tasks by every possible means. The tasks of transportation are very heavy, especially the transportation from the producing areas to the distribution centers, where there are more problems; modern means of transportation should be integrated with the original civilian transportation capabilities, and efforts should be made to improve efficiency and eliminate empty return trips. For government agencies, organizations, schools, and urban residents, a certain amount of transportation and loading and unloading tasks should also be assigned according to their capabilities. While completing the procurement and transportation of agricultural products, the commercial departments must also do a good job in supplying commodities to rural areas, meeting the urgent needs of the people's communes and peasants to purchase means of production and means of livelihood after selling agricultural products; the financial departments must seize the work of transferring and settling accounts in the procurement, recovering loans, and absorbing deposits to support the capital needs of agricultural product procurement. In this way, ensuring that agricultural products enter the cities well and industrial products go to the countryside well, and closely integrating the two aspects of work, is one of the important tasks in current economic work.

    大运动套小运动　长运动套短运动
    突击收购和调运农产品
    中共中央和国务院指示加强领导、全面安排、合理组织
    新华社22日讯　中共中央、国务院关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示
    今年我国农业获得了史无前例的大丰收，广大人民为之欢欣鼓舞。但是，目前农产品收购和调运工作完成得不够好。应当收购的农产品还远远没有收购起来；已经收购起来的农产品，很多没有调运出来；若干城市和工矿区的农产品供应，已经显得紧张。这种情况，必须立即改变。
    最近一个时期，全国人民一面大搞钢铁，一面大搞秋收、秋藏、秋耕、秋种，在这种情况下，收购进度较慢，调运不够及时，这是完全可以理解的，也是正常的。今年紧张的性质和往年根本不同。往年是产品不足，今年是有了产品只是没有收上来。人民公社化以后，实行了劳动力的统一调配，可以进一步挖掘潜力，提高效率，用同样的力量，做更多的事情，这是完全可以办到的。问题在于有没有认真安排。什么事情没有安排，什么事情就可能没有人去做；而相反，什么事情只要得到安排，经过大家努力，就可以保证完成。充分地认识和掌握这个特点，更好地发挥人民公社的优越性，各项任务，包括农产品的收购和调运任务在内，是可以圆满完成的。
    近来，有些地方采取了全面安排、书记分工、组织专业队伍、分头突击、分片包干的办法，他们在大办钢铁、大搞秋耕秋种的同时，把收购和调运工作，同秋收、秋藏、农产品初步加工工作衔接起来，一气呵成。他们利用一切可以利用的时机和间隙，根据不同作物的收获情况，分期分批地突击收购，突击调运。这种做法已经收到显著的效果。
    中共中央和国务院认为：在当前的情况下，农产品的收购和调运工作，必须发动群众，把突击收购和经常收购结合起来，突击运输和经常运输结合起来。在大搞钢铁大搞农业的同时，插入收购和调运运动，大运动套小运动，长运动套短运动。农产品的收获，本身就带有很大的突击性，秋收以后，还有许多重要任务需要腾出手来去完成，农产品的收购调运工作，也必须实行突击，必须搞群众运动。目前劳动力虽然比较紧张，但是潜力还是有的，并不是每个可以劳动的人都充分发挥了力量，并不是每个单位的劳动力都组织得很好。问题的关键在于加强领导、全面安排和合理组织。
    中共中央和国务院要求各地对农产品的收购和调运工作，进行一次全面的检查。要求利用一切间隙，组织一切可以组织的力量，千方百计地完成任务。交通运输的任务是很繁重的，特别是从产地到集散地一段的运输，问题较多；应当把现代化的运输工具同民间原有的运输力量衔接起来，并且力求提高效率，消除回空现象。对于机关、团体、学校和城市居民，也应当根据他们力量的大小，分配给一定的运输任务和装卸任务。在完成农产品收购调运工作的同时，商业部门还必须做好农村的商品供应工作，满足人民公社和农民出售农产品以后购买生产资料和生活资料的迫切需要；金融部门必须抓紧收购中的转账结算和收回贷款、吸收存款的工作，支持农产品收购的资金需要。这样，使农产品很好地进城，工业品很好地下乡，并且把两方面的工作密切结合起来，这是当前经济工作中的重要任务之一。
