    Nature and Man
    —Letters from Yan'an
    Yan Ling

    The power of nature is immense. The Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi has been eroded and scoured into fragmented, gully-filled mountains over thousands of years. Looking at the undulating peaks, it is hard to imagine that tens of thousands of years ago, this place was once a sea. The stones on the cliffs bear witness: this was indeed once a sea. It was the seawater that deposited the remains of some animals and plants on the seabed, and then covered them with silt. After many years of change, these remains were transformed into layers of hard, black rock. Now, people call it oil shale.

    The power of man is even greater than that of nature. We must not only confine the floods that erode the earth to the mountains, making them serve us obediently, but also liberate the dead life that was once buried on the seabed and is now still buried under thick sand and gravel, allowing them to emit the light and heat that the sun entrusted to them to preserve tens of thousands of years ago.

    As we drove on the newly built highway from Panlong to Mao'ergou, we saw thick layers of black stone on the cliffs all the way. Fragments of them could also be seen everywhere among the stones on the river滩. This is oil shale. We are going to turn them into petroleum, and then into dozens of valuable things such as gasoline, diesel, and kerosene. Walking along the road, looking at the cliffs, I pondered the power of nature and the power of man.

    It was these mountains that sang joyful songs in the most difficult years, and nourished millions of revolutionaries with their wheat and millet. It was these mountains that sheltered the revolutionaries in their heroic struggle against the class enemies, and opened their mouths to devour tens of thousands of counter-revolutionary bandits. Glorious, nameless mountains, today, in the era of our communist great leap forward, in the era when our motherland is galloping forward with confidence and striving to "overtake England" and "overtake America," these mountains have opened their chests again, telling us: Look at this red, it is steel; look at this black, it is oil and coal; look at this grayish-white, it is aluminum and refractory clay; look at this blue-gray, it is gypsum… Do you want cement? After the oil shale is refined, the remaining stone, plus lime and gypsum, will do! Do you want chemical fertilizers? Send the gas left over from oil refining to the scrubbing tower and sprinkle it with a little sulfuric acid water, and you get ammonium sulfate. Do you need coke for ironmaking? Take the coal; but when you refine the coal into coke, don't treat the escaping gas as waste, it will also give you oil and many treasures. …Do you need water to run a factory? Look at this clear mountain spring. Do the workers have no place to live? Which gully can't be dug into a cave dwelling!

    The people who led the way and delivered messages for the revolutionary army during the arduous years of struggle against the enemy have, under the call of the Party, launched a mass movement to report mineral deposits. On the windowsills and desks of the Party committee and the Panlong Industrial Headquarters, there are all kinds of ores. The labels on the ores tell people where they came from and who sent them. Those old folks who are full of revolutionary traditions are still transporting luggage for the exploration team and leading the way in the valleys. On days when the sun is scorching hot and on rainy days, you can see these people, carrying eye-catching red and white markers and boxes of surveying tools and drilling tools, moving between the mountains.

    Who dares to say that the mountains of Yan'an are "poor mountains"?

    Just the oil shale here, how much is there! Only in the Panlong area, only those that can be seen with the naked eye, there are thirteen li wide and forty li long places, all with this black stone that can be ignited with a single spark. The currently explored area is about sixty square kilometers. The thickness is generally seven meters. In the middle of the seven-meter-thick rock layer, there is a half-meter-thick layer of aluminum ore (which is also a raw material for making refractory materials), a one and a half decimeter thick layer of coal, and a two-centimeter-thick layer of black alum; the pure oil shale layer is about six meters thick. What is the total reserve? One cubic meter weighs more than one ton. You can calculate the base number yourself! How much oil can be extracted? Young lab technician Sun Yulan told us that the oil content of oil shale here is highest at 8.5%, lowest at 3.5%, and generally around 5%. Roughly calculated, at least 15 million tons of crude oil can be produced. If 50,000 tons are produced a year, it will take three hundred years to refine it all! The most wonderful thing is that oil refining requires coal, and a layer of good coal is sandwiched in the oil shale layer. The stone left over after oil refining is good for making cement, and there happens to be a raw material for making cement nearby—gypsum.

    Coal is everywhere in the Panlong area. The oil content of coal is higher than that of oil shale. Oil can be extracted while coke is being refined. No wonder the coal here is so easy to burn and burns so vigorously!

    Iron, in Yan'an, except for two townships in Daocuan in the south, mineral deposits have been discovered in every township. Iron ore is often dug up when water conservancy projects are being built. Where there is iron ore, there is also coal, so there is no fear of not having coke for ironmaking. There is also plenty of limestone for ironmaking.

    Who knows how many mineral deposits have not yet been found?

    We arrived at Mao'ergou from Panlong in the evening. Suddenly, a dark cloud surged from the northwest, and in an instant, it was a torrential downpour. In the rain, the sunlight still shone on many peaks and cliffs. I kept watching the autumn crops on the mountain and the rock layers on the cliffs, and thinking about the power of nature and the power of man. After the rain, looking east on the hillside, a brilliant rainbow was spanning the endless undulating peaks. I cannot help but think of the lines written by Chairman Mao in the Ruijin era: "Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, who is holding the colored silk to dance in the sky? After the rain, the setting sun slants, and the mountains are shrouded in green. In those years, the battle was urgent, and the bullet holes were in the village walls in front. Decorate the North Pass Mountain, which looks better today." This is a victory song after the Red Army shattered the four "encirclements and suppressions" of the counter-revolutionary armed forces. Now, here, a new battle—a battle against nature—is unfolding. What makes the mountains look better is no longer the bullet holes in the village walls, but the new walls of the factories under construction.

    There are some well-built cave dwellings made of bricks and stones in Mao'ergou Village. It is said that they were the former residence of the "Song Regiment Chief" who once flaunted his power in the Panlong area more than twenty years ago. In the spring of 1935, the Red Guards in the Panlong area launched a series of offensives against the counter-revolutionary armed forces in order to welcome the Central Red Army to northern Shaanxi. The "Song Regiment Chief" had to hide in the stockade with a group of defeated soldiers. The Red Guards, empty-handed, sawed off elm wood and hollowed out the hearts of the trees to make "cannons"; they also put firecrackers in kerosene barrels and lit them to become morale-boosting "machine guns". The "cannon" fired three times in a row, opening the stockade and capturing the "Song Regiment Chief" alive.

    Today, we are attacking nature, and we still have to rely on these heroic figures, and we still have to rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses to let indigenous methods and indigenous tools display their power! Farmers can quickly become soldiers, and they will certainly be able to quickly become workers. Every production team should run industry on a large scale. Just wait and see the new "Red Guards" on the industrial front show their great talents!

    大自然和人
    ——延安书简
    燕凌
    大自然的力量是强大的。陕北黄土高原，几千年被冲刷侵蚀成了支离破碎千沟万壑的山地，望着起伏的峰峦，很难想像，若干万年以前，这里又曾经是大海，山崖上的石头在为我作证：这里的的确确曾经是大海。正是海水把一些动植物的残骸沉到海底，又在上面压上泥沙；又经过许多年的变化，把这些动植物的残骸变成了一层一层黑色的坚硬的石头。现在，人们把它叫做油页岩。
    人的力量比大自然更强大。我们不但要把冲刷侵蚀大地的洪水禁闭在山上，让它们驯服地为我们服务，还要把曾经被压在海底、而今仍然压在厚厚的沙石之下的死了的生命解放出来，让它们重新发出多少万年以前太阳交给它们保存的光和热。
    当我们在新修的公路上从蟠龙走向毛儿沟的时候，一路看到崖上都有那么厚厚的一层黑石头；河滩里的石块中间，到处也可以看到它们的碎片。这就是油页岩。我们正是要叫它们变成石油，再变成汽油、柴油、煤油等等几十种宝贵的东西。走着路，望着山崖，我思索着大自然的力量和人的力量。
    正是这些山，曾经在最艰苦的年代发出欢乐的歌声，以它的麦子和小米养育了千百万革命者。正是这些山，曾经庇护革命者对阶级敌人进行了英勇的斗争，张开大口吞噬了成千上万反革命匪徒。光荣的无名的群山啊，今天，在我们共产主义大踏步前进的年代里，在我们的祖国快马加鞭信心百倍“超英”“超美”的年代里，这些山，又敞开了胸膛，告诉我们：看这红色的，是钢铁；看这黑色的，是石油和煤炭；看这灰白色的，是铝和耐火泥；看这青灰色的，是石膏……你们要水泥吗？把油页岩炼出油以后，剩下的石头，再加上石灰、石膏就行了！你们要化学肥料吗？把炼油剩下的气体送到洗涤塔里洒上淡淡的硫酸水就是硫酸铵。炼铁要焦炭吗？把煤炭拿去吧；在把煤炭炼成焦炭的时候，可不要把冒出来的气体当成废物，它也会给你油，给你许多宝贝。……办工厂需要水吗？你看这清清的山泉，工人没有地方住吗？哪一条山沟不能挖窑洞！
    在对敌斗争的艰苦年代里曾经为革命军队带路、报信的人们，在党的号召下，又展开了群众性的报矿活动。在党委会和蟠龙工业指挥部的窗台上，桌子上，放满了各色各样的矿石。矿石上贴着的标签，告诉人们，它们来自什么地方，是谁把它们送来的。给勘探队运送行装和在山谷里带路的，还是那些满身是革命传统的老乡们。日晒似火烧的日子，落雨的日子，都可以看到这些带着几节红几节白的耀眼的标杆和一箱一箱测量工具、钻探工具的人们，在群山之间移动。
    谁还敢说延安的山是“穷山”？
    光是油页岩，这里就有多少呀！只是在蟠龙一带，只是有露头一眼可以看出来的，就有十三里宽、四十里长的地方，都有这种一点就能着火的黑石头。目前已经勘测过的，也有大约六十平方公里。厚度，一般都是七公尺。七公尺的岩层中间，夹着半公尺厚的一层铝矿（也是做耐火材料的原料），一公寸半厚的煤炭，两公分厚的黑矾；纯油页岩层大约有六公尺厚。蕴藏量总共有多少？一立方公尺是一吨多重。你就拿这个基数自己计算一下吧！能炼出多少油来？年轻的化验员孙玉兰告诉我们，这里的油页岩含油量最高的是8.5％，最低的3.5％，一般的大约5％。粗略算一下，至少能出一千五百万吨原油。如果一年生产五万吨的话，足足要用三百年工夫才能炼完呢！最妙的是，炼油需要煤炭，在油页岩层中就夹着一层很好的煤炭。炼油后剩下的石头好做水泥，附近正好有配合做水泥用的原料——石膏。
    蟠龙一带，到处都有煤炭。煤炭的含油率比油页岩还高，一边炼焦炭，一边就可以出油。怪不得这里的煤炭那么容易燃烧，烧起来那么旺！
    铁，在延安，除了南边—道川的两个乡以外，每个乡都已经发现矿藏，在修水利的时候就时常挖出铁矿石来。有铁矿的地方也都有煤炭，不怕没有炼铁用的焦炭。炼铁用的石灰石也有的是。
    还没有摸清楚的矿藏，谁知道有多少？
    我们从蟠龙到了毛儿沟，已是傍晚。突然西北方涌上一片乌云，霎时间就是一阵倾盆大雨。雨中，阳光仍然照耀着许多山峰和山崖。我一直注视着山上的秋庄稼和崖上的岩石层，又想着大自然的力量和人的力量。雨后，在山坡上向东方一望，一道灿烂的长虹正跨在无边的起伏的山峰上。不能不想起毛主席在瑞金时代写的诗句：“赤橙黄绿青蓝紫，谁持彩练当空舞？雨后复斜阳，关山阵阵苍。当年鏖战急，弹洞前村壁。装点北关山，今朝更好看。”这是当年红军粉碎了反革命武装的四次“围剿”以后的胜利的颂歌。现在，在这里，一场新的激战——对大自然的战斗正在展开。把山峦装点得更好看的，不再是村壁的弹洞，而是正在建筑中的工厂的新墙。
    毛儿沟村子里有一些用砖石砌的很讲究的窑洞。听说就是二十多年前在蟠龙一带曾经耀武扬威一时的“宋团总”当年的家宅。1935年春天，蟠龙一带的赤卫队为了迎接中央红军到陕北来，对反革命武装发动了一连串的进攻。“宋团总”不得不带着一伙残兵败将躲在寨子里。赤手空拳的赤卫队员们，锯下榆木、挖空了心，做成了“大炮”；又用鞭炮放在煤油桶里点着，成为助威的“机关枪”。“大炮”连响三声，就把寨子打开，把“宋团总”活捉了。
    今天，我们向大自然进攻，还是要依靠这些英雄人物，还是要依靠群众的智慧和力量，让土办法土工具大逞威风！农民既能很快地变成兵士，也一定能很快地变成工人。每个生产队都要大办工业。等着瞧工业战线上的新的“赤卫队”大显神通吧！
