    How to View Royalties
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    Our country is accelerating socialist construction and preparing conditions for a gradual transition to communism. The people's communes in the countryside have already made significant reforms in the distribution system, and the communist spirit of the masses is being greatly promoted. The royalty system, which represents the remnants of bourgeois rights in the cultural and publishing circles, is completely incompatible with the situation of the socialist great leap forward in our country. Many writers and contributors have recognized the necessity of further fundamentally reforming the royalty system. Newspapers and publishing houses in Shanghai have already revised their remuneration methods. Now, major newspapers and publishing houses in Beijing have also decided to generally reduce royalty standards by about half from October 1st. This is the beginning of eliminating the wide disparity in remuneration between mental and physical labor, and it is a major event in the cultural and publishing circles.

    However, in the process of changing the current royalty method, there is also a struggle between two roads. One is the road of developing socialism, advocating putting politics in command, and promoting communist consciousness; the other is the road of developing capitalism, advocating the idea of worshipping money. Those who are full of bourgeois ideas say, if royalties are lowered, who will be willing to write? But those who proceed from the socialist and communist viewpoint affirm that lowering royalties will not affect the source of manuscripts. We must ask: Is the power of politics greater, or the power of money? In our society today, countless facts have proved that putting politics in command and the proletarian communist consciousness have gained the upper hand, and the idea of worshipping money and the bourgeois selfish and self-interested thinking are bound to go bankrupt. There is an old feudal Chinese saying that "money can make the devil turn the mill!" In the old society and the old system, this once reflected the objective reality to some extent. But today, society has changed, and this is no longer an era where money can make the devil turn the mill. The working class consciously and voluntarily abolishes the piece-rate wage system, and the masses of people participate in a large number of voluntary labor. What does this mean? This shows that the power of money is disappearing! Two years ago, a scientific bonus system was formulated, but due to the lack of ideological liberation, inventions and creations were rare; but this year, with politics in command, inventions and creations blossomed everywhere.

    At present, the mass literary creation of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers is unprecedentedly prosperous, and communist literature and art are growing. People's talents are blooming like spring flowers, and creative enthusiasm is surging like a thousand springs. Since last winter and this spring, the literary creations of workers, peasants, and soldiers have numbered in the hundreds of millions, and many works with high political and ideological content and perfect artistic skills have emerged. Why do they create? They create to praise the miracles created by their labor, to praise socialism, and to praise the Communist Party. They are not for royalties. Facts show that the working people want to create, to express the voice from the bottom of their hearts, not for a few pennies. After Shanghai lowered the royalty standards, the manuscript situation of newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses has not changed, and with the deepening development of the cultural revolution, the number of manuscripts is increasing day by day. Many writers and amateur writers have also expressed their willingness to support the initiative of taking less royalties with the action of writing more manuscripts. These facts are all refuting the nonsense that lowering royalties will affect the source of manuscripts.

    It is natural for writers and contributors to newspapers and periodicals to receive certain remuneration for writing books or manuscripts. However, the current royalties are not only too high, but also have many fundamentally unreasonable aspects. Writers often receive hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of yuan for publishing a book; amateur writers often receive several yuan to dozens of yuan for publishing an article. The income of writers and amateur writers is very different from that of ordinary staff, especially workers and peasants, which creates a situation where some writers live too comfortably, gradually become detached from the working people, detached from actual struggles, and foster a mentality of fame and fortune. Isn't there a "one-bookism" appearing! Some people get "royalty obsessed" and are not content with their jobs. Aren't there people "striving for a deposit of 30,000 yuan"! Some people even become morally corrupt and leave the ranks of the working people. Isn't there such a person as Kong Jue! Now, lowering the royalty standards will help to shorten the distance between writers and the working people in life, go deep into life, go deep into the masses, integrate with the working people, and transform themselves in labor training and actual struggles. Writers overcoming individualistic ideas of fame and fortune and raising communist consciousness will surely write more and better works and make greater contributions to the people.

    The vast majority of writers and contributors now engage in writing in their spare time. And in the future, more and more, even all writers and contributors, will engage in writing in their spare time. Many people are both workers and writers; both peasants and poets; eliminating the boundaries between physical and mental labor. We can already see such writers and poets. Only these people, who participate in production struggles and participate in actual life, can better reflect real life and create perfect works with high ideological and artistic levels. In a communist society, our writers will all be amateur writers. Taking today's amateur writers as an example, they all have their own wages or receive state supply, so royalties are only a reward for them. Lowering royalties has no impact on their lives. Of course, there are still a small number of professional writers now. Lowering royalties may have some impact on their lives, but this impact will not be too great. The era of the "poor and frustrated" literati in the old society is gone forever. The state and relevant departments will make appropriate arrangements for them to ensure their lives and enable them to write with peace of mind.

    Socialist newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses can be run well and vigorously because they follow the mass line and mobilize the strength of the masses on the basis of the communist consciousness of the vast number of amateur writers and amateur writers. Capitalist newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses, on the contrary, only follow the individual line and use high royalties to buy off idle literati. They will not be run well. Therefore, lowering royalty standards has important political significance. The people's reward to writers is not only reflected in the royalties through newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses, but more importantly, the people's welcome to the works and the people's praise to the writers. As long as the writer wholeheartedly serves the people and writes hero people who are worthy of representing our great era, then he will surely be praised and encouraged by the people. Communist labor is conscious and voluntary labor, unconditional labor. In this case, people will not only not become lazy, but also their labor morale will be higher and they will do more and better. We hope that writers will raise their communist consciousness and regard the praise and encouragement from the people as the greatest honor and the highest reward, thereby inspiring themselves to carry out communist labor!

    怎样看待稿费
    本报评论员
    我国正在加速社会主义建设，并为逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件，农村中的人民公社在分配制度上已经作出了重大改革，人民群众的共产主义精神正在大大发扬，在文化出版界表现资产阶级的法权残余的稿费制度是同我国的社会主义大跃进的形势完全不相适应的。许多作家和投稿者已经认识到进一步根本改革稿费制度的必要，上海的报刊、出版社已经修改了稿酬办法。现在，北京各主要报刊、出版社也决定从10月1日起，一般地降低稿酬标准一半左右，这是消除脑力劳动和体力劳动在报酬上差别悬殊的开端，是文化出版界的一件大事。
    但是，在改变现行稿酬办法的过程中，也有两条道路的斗争。一条是发展社会主义的道路，提倡政治挂帅，发扬共产主义觉悟；一条是发展资本主义的道路，提倡拜金思想。满脑子资产阶级观点的人说，降低稿费还行，那谁还愿意写稿！？而从社会主义、共产主义的观点出发的人，则肯定地说降低稿费不会影响稿源。我们要问：政治的力量大，还是金钱的力量大？在我们今天的社会里，已经有无数的事实证明，政治挂帅，无产阶级的共产主义觉悟已经占了上风，拜金思想，资产阶级的自私自利思想一定要破产。中国有句封建老话说是“有钱能使鬼推磨！”在旧社会旧制度下，这曾经在某种程度上反映了客观实际。但是今天社会变了，这已经不是有钱能使鬼推磨的时代了。工人阶级自觉自愿地取消计件工资制，人民群众大量地参加义务劳动，这是什么？这说明金钱的力量在消失中！前两年，制定了一个科学奖金制度，但是由于思想没有解放，发明创造寥若晨星；而今年，政治挂了帅，发明创造花开满园。
    目前工农商学兵群众文艺创作空前繁荣，共产主义的文学艺术正在成长。人们的才能如春花怒放，创作热情如万泉迸涌。去冬今春以来，工农兵群众的文艺创作数以亿计，而且出现了许多具有高度政治思想性和艺术技巧完美的作品。他们为什么创作呢？他们是为了歌颂自己劳动创造出的奇迹，为了歌颂社会主义，歌颂共产党。他们不是为了稿费。事实说明劳动人民要创作，是要发出他们心底的声音，而不是为了几个钱。上海降低了稿费标准以后，报纸刊物和出版社的来稿情况并没有改变，而且随着文化革命的深入发展，来稿正日益增多。许多作家和业余写作者也都表示，以多写稿子的行动来支持少拿稿费的倡议。这些事实，都在反击降低稿费会影响稿源的胡说。
    作家和报纸刊物的投稿者，他们写了书或者稿子，受到一定的报酬，自然是可以的。可是，现在的稿费不但过高，而且有许多根本不合理的地方。作家印出了一本书，往往得到数百元、数千元以至数万元；业余写稿者发表了一篇稿子，往往得到数元至数十元。作家和业余写稿者的收入，同一般工作人员、特别是工人、农民的收入很悬殊，这就造成了一部分作家生活过于优裕，逐渐脱离劳动人民，脱离实际斗争，并助长名利观念。不是有“一本书主义”者出现么！有的人得了“稿费迷”，不安心本岗位工作。不是有“为存款三万元而奋斗”的人么！甚至有的人道德败坏，离开了劳动人民的队伍。不是有孔厥其人么！现在降低稿费标准，将有助于缩短作家和劳动人民在生活上的距离，深入生活，深入群众，同劳动人民打成一片，在劳动锻炼和实际斗争中改造自己。作家克服个人主义的名利观念，提高共产主义觉悟，一定会写出更多更好的作品，对人民作出更大的贡献。
    现在的作家和投稿者，绝大部分是在业余从事写作的。而将来的作家和投稿者，将更多的一直到完全是在业余从事写作的。许多人既是工人，又是作家；既是农民，又是诗人；消除了体力劳动和脑力劳动的界限。我们现在已经可以看到这样的作家和诗人。也只有这些人，他们参加生产斗争，参加实际生活，才能更好地反映现实生活，创造出完美的具有高度的思想水平和艺术水平的作品来。到共产主义社会里，我们的作家将都是业余作家。拿今天的业余作家来说，他们都有自己的工资，或者得到国家的供给，所以稿费对于他们来说，只是一种奖励。降低稿费，对于他们的生活是没有影响的。自然，现在还有数量很少的专业作家。降低稿费对于他们的生活可能会发生某些影响，但是，这影响是不会太大的。旧社会中的文人
  “穷愁潦倒”的时代已经一去不复返了，国家和有关方面会对他们作出适当的安排，使他们的生活有所保障，能够安心写作。
    社会主义的报纸刊物和出版社，所以能够办得好，办得有生气，就在于走群众路线，在广大业余作家和业余写作者的共产主义觉悟提高的基础上，动员群众的力量来办。而资本主义的报纸刊物和出版社则相反，他们只走个人路线，用高额稿费去收买无聊文人，他们是不会办好的。所以降低稿费标准，有重要的政治意义。人民群众对作家的报酬，并不只是通过报纸刊物和出版社体现在稿费上，而更重要的是人民群众对作品的欢迎和对作家的赞扬。只要作家全心全意为人民服务，写出无愧于表现我们伟大的时代的英雄人民，那他就一定会受到人民群众的赞扬和鼓励。共产主义的劳动是自觉自愿的劳动，是无条件的劳动。在这种情况下，人们不但不会变懒，而且劳动情绪会更高涨，做得更多更好。我们希望作家提高共产主义觉悟，并且把来自人民群众的赞扬和鼓励当作最大的荣誉和最高的报酬，从而激励自己，进行共产主义的劳动！
