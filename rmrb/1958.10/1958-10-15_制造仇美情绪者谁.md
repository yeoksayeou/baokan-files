Editorial Note:

    The several news items on the international page today are about how unpopular the United States is everywhere. Even George Kennan had to lament that the United States is the most hated country in the world.

    This is not surprising. Shouldn't the United States' rampant霸道, ferocious and wicked, and outrageous acts all over the world arouse condemnation, disgust, and hatred from all people who have peaceful aspirations, national self-esteem, and a sense of justice? As you sow, so shall you reap.

    However, those gentlemen in Washington seem to have a penchant for sowing thorns. They have already made the United States the most hated country in the world, and they still feel unsatisfied. They are doing everything in their power to commit more rampant霸道, ferocious and wicked, and outrageous acts around the world. This can only arouse more condemnation, disgust, and hatred from the people of the world.

    An old Chinese proverb says: "Condemned by a thousand, he will die without illness." Isn't it very clear what the end will be for those who are condemned, disgusted, and hated by hundreds of millions of people?

    制造仇美情绪者谁
    今天国际版刊载的几则消息是关于美国到处不得人心的。连凯南这样的人，也不得不感叹美国是世界上最受人憎恨的国家。
    这是毫不奇怪的，难道美国在世界各地横行霸道、穷凶极恶，胡作非为的行径还不该引起一切有和平愿望、有民族自尊心、有正义感的人们詈骂恶感和仇恨吗？种瓜的得瓜，种蒺藜的得刺，此之谓也。
    但是，华盛顿的那些老爷们，看来有种蒺藜之癖。他们已经使美国成为世界上最受人憎恨的国家，而犹感心有不足。他们正竭尽全力地在世界各地干出更多的横行霸道、穷凶极恶、胡作非为的行径。这只能引起世界人民更多的詈骂、恶感和仇恨。
    中国的古谚说：千夫所指，无疾而终。受到亿万人民的詈骂、恶感和仇恨的，会有怎样的下场，难道不是很明白的吗？
