    Strengthening Communist Education
    Now Has Greater Practical Significance

    The fourth issue of "Leap Forward," a theoretical publication sponsored by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published on October 5th, contains an article entitled "Strengthen Communist Education." The article states: Our Party has always attached great importance to communist ideological education. Now, due to many extremely significant new changes in the social landscape of our country, such as the development from advanced agricultural cooperatives to people's communes in rural areas, the emergence of versatile workers in industrial and agricultural production, the socialization of certain household chores, and the promotion and popularization of a spirit of large-scale collaboration between regions and departments, all of these contain certain elements of a communist society, embryonic forms of a communist society. Therefore, conducting communist ideological education at present has greater realistic and practical significance.

    The article states: At present, strengthening communist ideological education aims to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish communist ideology, thereby promoting the early realization of a communist society. The unequal remnants of bourgeois rights still play a role in current social life. This is originally an inevitable reflection of the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor left over from the old society. Our direction is to eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor, not to deepen these differences. We must rely on strengthening communist ideological education, on continuously improving people's ideological awareness and moral qualities, and enhancing collectivism, rather than solely relying on material rewards to stimulate people.

    Regarding the methods of strengthening communist ideological education, the article states: It must be combined with the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, combined with the central tasks, and the strengthening of communist ideological education must be regarded as a great driving force for completing the current realistic combat tasks, so that everyone can see the dawn of a communist society is in sight, and advance more bravely!

    加强共产主义教育
    现在具有更大的实践意义
    10月5日出版的中共江西省委主办的理论刊物“跃进”第四期刊登了一篇题为“把共产主义教育加强起来”的文章。文章说：我们的党，一贯是极为重视共产主义的思想教育的。现在由于我们国家的社会面貌发生了许多极其重大的新变化：如农村中由高级农业合作社发展到人民公社，工农业生产中多面手的出现，某些家务劳动的社会化，各地区、各部门之间大协作精神的发扬和普及，这些，都包含了若干共产主义社会的因素，共产主义社会的雏型形式。因此，目前进行共产主义的思想教育，就有其更大的现实意义和实践意义了。
    文章说：当前，加强共产主义思想教育，其目的就是要破除资产阶级思想，树立共产主义思想，从而促进共产主义社会的早日实现。资产阶级的不平等的法权残余，在当前的社会生活中也仍然在起着作用。这本来是旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动与脑力劳动差别的必然反映。我们的方向，是消灭工农之间、城乡之间、体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的差别，而不是去加深这些差别。我们要靠加强共产主义思想教育，靠不断地提高人们的思想觉悟和道德品质，提高集体主义精神，而不应光拿物质奖励去刺激人。
    关于加强共产主义思想教育的作法，文章说：必须结合当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设，结合中心工作，要把加强共产主义的思想教育，作为完成当前现实的战斗任务的伟大动力，要使人人都能看到共产主义社会曙光在望，更加奋勇前进！
