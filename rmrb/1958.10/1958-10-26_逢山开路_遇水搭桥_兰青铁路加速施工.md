    Forging Roads Through Mountains, Building Bridges Across Rivers
    Accelerated Construction of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway

    (Our dispatch) The tens of thousands of railway workers constructing the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway are accelerating the pace of construction through selfless labor, forgoing Sundays and engaging in technical revolution. Currently, the main structures of over forty of the sixty-eight bridge piers and abutments of the ten major bridges on the Xining-Hekou section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway have been completed; most of the ten tunnels, totaling over two thousand meters in length, have been bored through; and earthwork for the roadbed is being intensified. On the sixty-six-kilometer construction line from Hekou to the junction of Gansu and Qinghai provinces, track-laying and bridge-building teams are making all preparations for track-laying.

    As soon as the construction army entered Qinghai Province, they were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups. The leading organs of Qinghai Province held welcome meetings for them, and the leading Party and government officials personally visited their residences to offer greetings. Shortly after the start of construction, people from all walks of life in Qinghai Province dispatched a慰问团delegation headed by the provincial governor to the various construction sites to express their regards. The people's communes along the construction line built on-site housing for them, ensuring "vegetables when you want vegetables, people when you need people" to support the construction army. And 20,000 commune members have joined the construction ranks.

    The railway workers dare to think and dare to act, and the start dates of various projects have been constantly brought forward, and the construction progress is getting faster and faster. This year, the flood season in the Qinghai area came early and left late, and the flood water level reached the highest level in nearly a century, which increased the difficulty of bridge construction. The workers broke the convention of not carrying out construction during the flood season, fighting the flood on the one hand and continuing construction as usual on the other. Due to the continuous leap forward in construction progress, many difficulties have arisen in the supply of equipment and materials and the transportation of goods. When construction materials such as cement and explosives were not available, they adjusted their use on the one hand and built their own factories to try to manufacture them on the other; when there were not enough construction tools, they carried out a large-scale technical revolution, launched a small-scale mechanization movement, and mobilized all transportation tools such as horse-drawn carts and handcarts to participate in short-distance transportation, concentrating motor vehicles to undertake the long-distance transportation of major projects.

    逢山开路　遇水搭桥
    兰青铁路加速施工
    本报讯　修筑兰青铁路的数万名铁路职工，以星期日不休假和大搞技术革命的忘我劳动，加快筑路进度。现在兰青铁路西宁——河口段十座大桥的六十八座桥台、桥墩，已经完成了四十多座的主体工程；全长二千多公尺的十座隧道，大部分已经打通；路基的土石方工程正在加紧进行。从河口到甘、青交界处全长六十六公里的施工线上，铺轨架桥队在作铺轨前的一切准备。
    筑路大军一进入青海境内，就受到了广大各族人民的热烈欢迎。青海省领导机关为他们举行了欢迎会，党政首长亲自到他们住地看望。开工不久，青海省各族各界又派出以省长为首的慰问团，分赴各个工地进行慰问。工地沿线人民公社为他们修建了工地住房，保证“要菜有菜，要人有人”支援筑路大军。并有两万名社员参加了筑路行列。
    铁路职工们敢想敢干，各项工程的动工日期不断提前，施工进度越来越快。今年，青海地区洪水期来得早，去得慢，洪水水位达到近百年来的最高纪录，增加了桥梁施工的困难。职工们打破了洪水期不进行施工的常规，一面同洪水搏斗，一面照常施工。由于施工进度的不断跃进，器材供应和物资运输发生了许多困难。水泥、炸药等筑路材料供应不上，他们就一面调剂使用，一面自己建厂试制；施工用具不够，他们又大搞技术革命，开展了小型机械化的运动，并调动马车、手推车等一切运输工具，参加短途运输，集中汽车担负了主要工程的长途运输。
