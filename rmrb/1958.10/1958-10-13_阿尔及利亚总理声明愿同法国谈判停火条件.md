Conversely, if the de Gaulle government prefers to play more tricks and attempts to deceive our people once again, its tricks will be exposed like those of previous governments, and this government will bear full responsibility for the continuing war."

    阿巴斯的声明强调指出，“如果戴高乐政府也准备停止军事行动，那末在不久的将来就可以举行会晤。反之，如果戴高乐政府宁愿再耍花招和企图再次欺骗我国人民，它的花招就将像他以前的各届政府一样被揭穿，那末这个政府就要对继续进行的战争负完全责任。”
