Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 10th - Shandong Province's relevant departments are taking emergency measures to ensure the safe overwintering of mining and smelting personnel and various blast furnaces. The Steel Production Office of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau jointly convened a meeting in early October, requiring all localities to take the following measures: 1. Furnace groups in areas with inconvenient transportation and roads easily blocked by wind and snow should have one month's reserve of iron smelting raw materials and other materials. Some raw materials should be covered with straw to prevent freezing. 2. For some blast furnaces that use water jacket tuyeres or pot camel machines for power, water sources and water pipes should be protected early to ensure they do not freeze. 3. Where there is motor equipment, attention should be paid to the dryness of the motor installation site. 4. When the furnace is overhauled, mat sheds should be set up to make fires to prevent freezing. When production is stopped, it is strictly forbidden to pour water; the surroundings of the furnace should be kept dry to avoid freezing the furnace foundation. 5. It is required that all indigenous furnaces be equipped with indigenous hot blast stoves in November. The materials used for repairing hot blast stoves should be solved locally, and tile pipes should be used instead of iron pipes as much as possible.
	The relevant units have also made proper arrangements for the winter food, lodging, and labor protection of mining and smelting personnel. The methods adopted are: 1. In rural areas, the people's communes can mobilize the masses to spare some of their houses for iron smelting personnel to live in; in cities, auditoriums, clubs, warehouses, offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, etc. can be fully utilized to achieve "multiple uses for one room" as much as possible. 2. Mobilize workers to build simple housing, such as digging semi-underground cellars, building straw sheds, reed sheds, cloth sheds, using existing walls to build one-sided rooms, and digging cave dwellings by using ditch cliffs. 3. Along transportation arteries, the people's communes along the route should appropriately solve the accommodation problem for transportation personnel.
	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 10th - A large number of blast furnaces in Guizhou Province, using indigenous methods, are carrying out a technological innovation movement to change cold air to hot air, improve the quantity and quality of iron, and create conditions for the smooth overwintering of indigenous furnaces. As of October 5, 957 indigenous blast furnaces in 30 counties across the province, including Suiyang, Huangping, and Zhenfeng, had been converted from blowing cold air to blowing hot air. The 251 indigenous blast furnaces put into production in Bijie County have basically been converted to hot air.
	With the support of the local Party committees, the furnace workers in Daozhen, Zunyi, and Huishui counties began in August to boldly start changing cold air to hot air based on the "heat exchange" principle of "foreign" blast furnaces. They use the gas from the indigenous blast furnaces to introduce hot blast furnaces to heat the cold air; or they directly use fuel to burn in the hot blast furnace to heat the cold air. Both of these methods turn the cold air blown into the blast furnace into hot air above 300 degrees Celsius, ensuring that the temperature inside the furnace is always maintained above 1,500 degrees Celsius.
	Many regions have summarized the methods of converting cold air to hot air for indigenous blast furnaces, believing that there are four major benefits: (1) Due to the increase in furnace temperature, the ore melts better and faster, increasing the output of pig iron. (2) The quality of pig iron is greatly improved. (3) Fuel is saved. (4) It can enable indigenous blast furnaces to overwinter smoothly.

    冬季炼铁打胜仗
    山东贵州及时准备高炉过冬
    新华社济南10日电　山东省有关部门采取紧急措施，保证采矿冶炼人员及各种高炉安全过冬。中共山东省委钢铁生产办公室和山东省冶金工业局在10月初联合召开会议，要求各地采取以下措施：一、在交通不便和道路易被风雪封锁地区的炉群，应有一个月的炼铁原料及其他物资的储备，一部分原料应用草秸盖好，以防冻结。二、有些用水套风口或用锅驼机做动力的高炉，水源地和水管要早保护，确保不冻。三、有电机设备的地方要注意电动机安装地点的干燥。四、炉子大修时要用席子搭棚生火防冻，停产时严禁用水浇；炉子四周要保持干燥，避免炉基冻坏。五、要求在11月份所有土炉都安上土热风炉，修热风炉用的材料因地制宜解决，尽可能用缸瓦管代替铁管。
    对采矿冶炼人员的冬季食宿和劳动保护，有关单位也作了妥善安排。采取的办法是：一、在农村，可由人民公社发动群众，尽量挪出一部分民房给炼铁人员住；在城市，可充分利用礼堂、俱乐部、仓库、办公室、会议室、教室等，尽量作到“一屋多用”。二、发动工人建筑简易住房，如挖半明半暗地窖，搭草棚、席棚、布棚，利用原有墙壁搭一面房，利用沟崖挖窑洞等。三、在运输要道，由沿途人民公社适当解决运输人员的住宿问题。
    据新华社贵阳10日电　贵州省土法上马的大批高炉，正在开展把冷风改为热风的技术革新运动，提高铁的数量和质量，并为土炉顺利过冬创造条件。到10月5日，全省已有绥阳、黄平、贞丰等三十个县的九百五十七座土高炉由鼓冷风改成了鼓热风。毕节县投入生产的二百五十一座土高炉已经基本改为热风。
    道真、遵义和惠水等县的高炉工人们在当地党委的支持下，从8月份开始，就根据“洋”高炉加热的“换热式”原理，大胆地着手改冷风为热风。他们利用土高炉的煤气引入热风炉来加热冷风；或是直接用燃料在热风炉内燃烧来加热冷风。这两种方法，都使鼓进高炉内的冷风变成摄氏三百度以上的热风，保证炉内温度经常保持在一千五百度以上。
    许多地区对土高炉改冷风为热风的方法进行了总结，认为有四大好处：（1）由于炉内温度提高，矿石熔解较好较快，增加了生铁的产量。（2）大大提高了生铁的质量。（3）节省了燃料。（4）可以使土高炉顺利过冬。
