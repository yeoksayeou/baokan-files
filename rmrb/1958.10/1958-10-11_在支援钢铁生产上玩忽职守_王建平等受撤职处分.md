Negligence of Duty in Supporting Steel Production
Wang Jianping and Others Receive Demotions
(Our newspaper's reporter Bai Shulian reports) Wang Jianping, Deputy Director of the Materials Bureau of the Planning Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Bi Lige Tu, Director of the Planning Department (both Communist Party members), have been demoted for their negligence of duty in allocating materials to support steel production, demonstrating an intolerable bureaucratic attitude.

On October 2nd, an accident occurred at a blast furnace in the local state-owned Baotou Iron and Steel Plant, and after continuous day and night rescue efforts, the situation remained critical. On the morning of October 5th, the Baotou Municipal Party Committee telephoned the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee requesting the urgent dispatch of three to four tons of steel pipes for oxygen transmission to assist in the rescue. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee immediately decided to do everything possible to provide support and instructed Wang Jianping to personally inspect the actual inventory of steel pipes in the warehouse and allocate as much as possible; if the inventory was insufficient, the steel pipes designated for allocation to the Hulunbuir and Zhaowuda Leagues should also be transferred to Baotou. In this extremely urgent combat situation, Wang Jianping, apart from telling the warehouse management personnel to allocate as much as there was, neither personally inspected the warehouse nor checked the execution of relevant personnel. He even disregarded the urgency of the situation and the task and went to see a movie instead. And Bi Lige Tu, Director of the Planning Department, although aware of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee's instructions to urgently transfer steel pipes to support the rescue of the blast furnace in Baotou, concealed the actual inventory of steel pipes from the Party Committee, emphasized planned allocation, and resisted the instructions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee. When notified to immediately allocate four to five tons of steel pipes to Baotou, he said, "What do they need so much for!" Although there were 652 kilograms of steel pipes in stock, he only allocated 20 kilograms. Their erroneous attitude affected the blast furnace rescue work at the Baotou Iron and Steel Plant.

After this incident occurred, the Autonomous Region Inspection Department sent people to inspect overnight and proposed the dismissal of Wang Jianping and Bi Lige Tu from their posts. This proposal has been approved by the Autonomous Region People's Committee.

On October 8th, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Directly Subordinate Organs convened a Party Group Secretary Meeting. At the meeting, Ulanhu, Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee and Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, announced this decision and called on the attendees to resolutely establish a communist spirit of cooperation and the idea that everything should serve steel production. He also required all units to comprehensively clear warehouse materials, register and report them, and all materials needed for steel production should be centrally scheduled for use.

    在支援钢铁生产上玩忽职守
    王建平等受撤职处分
    本报讯　记者白树廉报道：内蒙古自治区计划委员会物资管理局副局长王建平、计划处处长毕力格图（都是共产党员），在调拨物资支援钢铁生产任务上玩忽职守，表现了不可容忍的官僚主义态度，已受到撤销职务的处分。
    10月2日，地方国营包头钢铁厂的一座高炉发生了事故，经连日昼夜抢救，情况仍然十分危急。5日上午，包头市委即打电话请求内蒙古自治区党委速调三、四吨输送氧气用的钢管支援抢救。内蒙古自治区党委立即决定尽力设法支援，并责成王建平亲自到仓库检查实际库存钢管的情况，有多少就拨多少；如库存不够，即将确定调给呼伦贝尔、昭乌达两盟的钢管也调给包头。在此十分紧急的战斗情况下，王建平除对仓库管理人员说了一下有多少拨多少外，既未亲自查看仓库，又未检查有关人员执行情况，甚至不顾情况和任务的急迫，而去看电影了。而计划处长毕力格图，虽然知道内蒙古自治区党委急需要钢管支援包头市抢救高炉的指示，但却向党委隐瞒库存钢管的实际情况，强调计划分配，抗拒内蒙古自治区党委的指示。当通知他即调给包头市四到五吨钢管时，他说：“要那么多干什么！”本来库存钢管有六百五十二公斤，但他却只调拨给二十公斤。由于他们的这些错误态度，使包头钢铁厂的高炉抢救工作，受到了影响。
    这件事发生后，自治区检查厅连夜派人检查，并提出建议撤销王建平、毕力格图二人职务。这一建议，已获自治区人民委员会批准。
    10月8日，内蒙古自治区直属机关召开党组书记会议。会上，自治区党委书记、自治区人民委员会主席乌兰夫宣布了这一决定，并号召与会人员坚决树立起共产主义的协作精神和一切都要为钢铁生产服务的思想，同时要求各单位普遍清理仓库物资，登记上报，凡是属于钢铁生产所需物资，都要统一调度使用。
