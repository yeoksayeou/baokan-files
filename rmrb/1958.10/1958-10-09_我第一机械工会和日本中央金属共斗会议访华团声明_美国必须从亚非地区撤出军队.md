Xinhua News Agency, 8th: The full text of the joint statement of the National Committee of the First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China and the visiting delegation of the Japan Confederation of Metal Industry Workers' Unions is as follows:

    In order to further strengthen the friendship and unity between metal and machinery workers and trade union organizations of China and Japan, at the invitation of the National Committee of the First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China, the visiting delegation of the Japan Confederation of Metal Industry Workers' Unions (including: National Metal, All Shipbuilding, Iron and Steel Labor Federation, Electrical Machinery Labor Federation, Vehicle Labor Federation, All Electric Wire) visited China during the National Day of the People's Republic of China in 1958. During the visit, they held talks with the First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China on the issue of the US war provocateurs creating tension in the Taiwan Strait region and expanding armed aggression against China's coastal islands, as well as further strengthening the friendship and unity between metal and machinery workers and trade unions of China and Japan. The talks were conducted in an extremely friendly and frank atmosphere. Both sides unanimously agreed that this is a major issue concerning the defense of peace in Asia and the world. The two sides hereby declare as follows:
    The American aggressors have long occupied China's territory of Taiwan by force. Recently, they have been deploying troops and accelerating war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region, creating tension, and obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan and coastal islands. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. The visiting delegation of the Japan Confederation of Metal Industry Workers' Unions fully supports the Chinese people's struggle against the war provocations of the American imperialists and the Chinese people's resolute struggle to liberate Taiwan. The joint statement issued recently by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan on this issue fully conforms to the common aspirations of the workers and people of China and Japan. The First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China sincerely thanks the Japanese metal and machinery workers and the Japanese people for their support of the just struggle of the Chinese machinery workers and the Chinese people.
    Under the tension created by the United States' military provocations and expanded aggression against China, the Kishi Nobusuke government is providing Japanese territory for the United States to use as a military base, and recently allowed the US military to transport nuclear weapons into Japan for nuclear armament. This is actually assisting the United States in its aggression against China, which is completely against the interests of the Japanese workers and people. The visiting delegation of the Japan Confederation of Metal Industry Workers' Unions believes that the Japanese government must stop this policy of continuing to be hostile to China. Japanese metal and machinery workers must fight together with the Japanese working class and the masses to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to quickly change its policy and make efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, restore trade, and normalize Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. At the same time, Japanese metal and machinery workers are resolutely fighting against the anti-democratic policies adopted by the Kishi Nobusuke government, such as illegally suppressing the workers' movement, destroying trade union organizations, infringing upon workers' rights, layoffs, wage reductions, and increased labor intensity. The First National Machinery Industry Trade Union of China fully supports the struggle of the Japanese workers and people for national independence, democracy, and freedom, and firmly believes that this just and reasonable struggle will surely be victorious.
    Both sides unanimously pointed out that in order to stop the United States from threatening peace in Asia, it is necessary to make the United States immediately withdraw its troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region, Okinawa and mainland Japan, Lebanon and the Middle East, and other regions in Asia and Africa.
    Chinese and Japanese metal and machinery workers and trade union organizations have established a deep friendship through mutual contact, exchange of information, and constant exchanges over the past four years, and this friendship is developing day by day. Both sides expressed their willingness to continue to strengthen this connection in the future, and to make unremitting efforts to support and cooperate with each other on issues of common concern; to eliminate artificial obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    新华社8日讯　中国第一机械工会全国委员会和日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团的联合声明，全文如下：
    为了进一步加强中日两国五金机械工人与工会组织的友谊和团结，在中华人民共和国1958年国庆节之际，应中国第一机械工会全国委员会的邀请，前来中国访问的日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团（包括：全国金属、全造船、铁钢劳连、电机劳连、车辆劳连、全电线），在访问期间，同中国第一机械工会就美国战争挑衅者在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，扩大对中国沿海岛屿武装侵略的问题，以及进一步加强中日两国五金机械工人与工会的友谊与团结的问题举行了会谈。会谈是在极其友好、坦率的气氛中进行的。双方一致认为这是关乎保卫亚洲及世界和平的重大问题。双方特此声明如下：
    美国侵略者长期用武力霸占中国的领土台湾，最近又在台湾海峡地区调兵遣将，加紧进行战争挑衅，制造紧张局势，阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿。这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，也是对亚洲及世界和平的严重威胁。日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团完全支持中国人民反对美帝国主义者的战争挑衅和中国人民坚决解放台湾的斗争。日前，中华全国总工会和日本工会总评议会就此问题发表的联合声明，完全符合中日两国工人和人民的共同愿望。中国第一机械工会衷心地感谢日本五金机械工人、日本人民给予中国机械工人、中国人民的正义斗争的支持。
    在美国进行军事挑衅、扩大对中国侵略所造成的紧张局势下，岸信介政府把日本领土供美国作军事基地之用，而且最近让美军把核武器运进日本进行核武装，实际上是协助美国对中国进行侵略，这是完全违反日本工人和人民的利益的。日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团认为：日本政府必须停止这种继续敌视中国的政策。日本五金机械工人要同日本工人阶级和人民群众一道进行斗争，迫使岸信介政府迅速改变其政策，为促进中日友好、恢复贸易和中日邦交正常化作出努力。同时，日本五金机械工人对岸信介政府所采取的非法镇压工人运动、破坏工会组织、侵害工人权利、解雇、减低工资、加强劳动强度等反民主的政策，正在进行坚决的斗争。中国第一机械工会完全支持日本工人和人民争取民族独立、民主、自由的斗争，并且深信这种正义合理的斗争必将取得胜利。
    双方一致指出：为了制止美国对亚洲和平进行威胁，必须使美国立即从台湾和台湾海峡地区、冲绳和日本本土、黎巴嫩和中近东以及其他亚非地区撤出其军队。
    中国和日本五金机械工人和工会组织，四年来通过互相联系、交换资料和不断的往来，已经建立了深厚的友谊，而且这种友谊正在日益发展着。双方表示愿在今后继续加强这种联系，对于双方共同要求彼此支持合作；为排除中日两国关系正常化的人为障碍，恢复中日邦交，保卫亚洲及世界和平作不懈的努力。
