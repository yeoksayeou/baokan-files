    Who Rules West Germany?
    Le Shan
    
    The Sensational "Blacklist"
    On October 11, 1945, the U.S. Senate Investigating Committee, chaired by Senator Kilgore, published a sensational "blacklist." Named on the list were forty-two German monopoly capitalists responsible for the bloodshed in Europe. Most of them were not punished in any way, and the few who were arrested were quickly released. Under the protection and support of U.S. imperialism, West German monopoly capital was revived. Now, West German monopoly capital is highly concentrated, with the capital stock of companies with more than ten million West German marks accounting for 82.1% of the total capital stock of all West German companies. They control key sectors such as mining, steelmaking, machinery manufacturing, electrical industry, shipbuilding, and chemical industry. The one hundred and fifty most powerful directors (including sixteen notorious monopoly capitalists from the "blacklist") who form the small group of West German financial oligarchs are the true rulers of West Germany today.
    
    High Concentration of West German Monopoly Capital
    According to the materials in the book "Who Rules Bonn?" published in Berlin not long ago: in the metallurgical industry, the capital stock of large companies accounts for 81% of the total capital stock of all metallurgical companies; in the coal industry, the capital stock of large companies accounts for 90%; in the oil sector, it accounts for as much as 99%; in the chemical industry, the capital stock owned by the successors of IG Farben – Bayer, Hoechst, and BASF – is three times more than the total capital stock of all other chemical companies; in the electrical sector, the capital stock of eight large companies accounts for 82% of the total, while the capital stock of Siemens and AEG accounts for 75% of the total; three large banks: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank control 55% of the total capital stock of various types in West Germany, and the remaining sixty-six West German banks are influenced by the above three banks.
    
    Monopoly Organizations Manipulate Industrial Production
    According to the materials in the East German "Economic Weekly" in 1957, the concentration of West German industry was already very significant in 1956:
    
    Industrial Sector		Number of Concerns		Percentage of Total Output (or Turnover) in the Sector
    Steel Industry		9		93.9
    Iron Ore Mining		6		99.9
    Hard Coal Mining		9		69.9
    Shipbuilding Industry		6		73.6
    Automobile Industry		5		88.6
    Chemical Industry		9		54.0
    Oil Extraction		5		95.1
    Potash Mining		2		83.8
    Electrical Industry		10		56.5
    *Figures for 1955.
    
    On August 8th this year, the West German "Parliamentary Political News Bulletin" pointed out that there are now eight major concerns in West Germany that control approximately 80% of the total West German production of iron and steel and one-third of coal mining. These monopoly organizations are: Thyssen Group, Krupp Concern, Flick Concern, Rheinstahl, Gutehoffnungshütte, Mannesmann, Hoesch AG, Klöckner & Co.
    
    The Foundation of the Adenauer Government
    West German monopoly capital, bank capital, and production have reached an unprecedented scale of concentration. Monopoly capitalists have direct agents in parliament and in the government. Ernst Thälmann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, once pointed out that in the current Bundestag, approximately one hundred members directly represent monopoly capital, bank capital, and wholesale commerce. He also pointed out that Adenauer has cronyistic ties with one of West Germany's largest concerns – the Werhahn Group, that Economics Minister Erhard comes from the Economic Union funded by "IG Farben trust," that Atomic Development Minister Balke is a representative of the chemical industry, that Foreign Minister von Brentano is a representative of the Reichlin Concern, and that those playing a leading role in the committee under the Atomic Development Ministry are the most well-known representatives of monopoly capital, such as representatives from Deutsche Bank, AEG, Esso – that is, the U.S. Rockefeller Concern, and IG Farben, etc.
    
    The collusion between West German and American monopoly capitalists in terms of capital and interests is the foundation of the Adenauer government.
    
    Serving Monopoly Capital Wholeheartedly
    The Adenauer group is a group that wholeheartedly serves the interests of monopoly capital. Hermann Reusch, the general manager of Gutehoffnungshütte, a large monopoly organization in West Germany that operates the steel, coal, and shipbuilding industries, had long ago clamored on behalf of monopoly capitalists, saying: "The current trend is to transfer state-owned enterprises and their shares into private hands."
    
    Under the pressure of monopoly capitalists, the West German government sold the state-owned Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyard in Hamburg to a consortium led by the Dortmunder Union-Brückenbau AG at the low price of 26 million marks. Rheinmetall-Borsig AG is a factory that produces armaments. After World War II, it was taken over by the occupying forces. In 1951, 51.8% of the factory's shares were transferred to the West German government. In 1956, the West German government sold its shares to the Reichlin Concern. After acquiring this company, the Reichlin Concern resold the company's Berlin subsidiary – Borsig AG – to the West German government. This was a bizarre transaction. However, a person in charge of Rheinmetall later revealed the secret. He said: "Reselling Borsig AG to the West German government is beneficial to both Rheinmetall and Borsig AG, because Borsig AG had been suffering losses." It turns out that monopoly capitalists sell unprofitable enterprises to the government, both to get rid of burdens and to obtain compensation, which is conducive to carrying out other activities and thereby obtaining greater profits.

    The situation in West Germany, as one of the major capitalist countries, powerfully proves that the Marxist-Leninist doctrine that production in capitalist countries is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few people and that monopoly capital intensifies its control over state politics is absolutely correct. However, when modern revisionists talk about the relationship between monopoly capital and the state, they say: "The state increasingly supervises capital, partially restricts the right of private management of capitalist property, and deprives private capital owners of certain independent functions in the economy and society," "Monopoly capital giants are increasingly losing their original completely independent role in certain sectors under their control, and certain functions of monopoly capital are being transferred to the state to an ever-greater extent" (see the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia). If modern revisionists make such absurd arguments, it is either due to complete ignorance of reality or for ulterior motives.

    谁是西德的统治者？
    乐山
    轰动一时的“黑名单”
    1945年10月11日，以参议员基里哥尔为主席的美国参议院调查委员会，公布了一张轰动一时的“黑名单”。榜上有名的是对欧洲流血惨祸负有责任的四十二名德国垄断资本家。他们大都没有受到任何惩处，少数被捕的也迅速地被释放。在美帝国主义的包庇、扶植下，西德的垄断资本复活了。现在，西德垄断资本高度集中，股本在一千万西德马克以上的公司的股金，占所有西德公司股金总额的82.1％。它们控制了矿业、炼钢业、机器制造业、电气业、造船业、化学工业等关键性的部门。组成西德金融寡头小集团的一百五十名势力最大的董事（包括“黑名单”中的十六名大名鼎鼎的垄断资本家），就是西德今日的真正统治者。
    西德垄断资本高度集中
    根据不久以前柏林出版的“谁是波恩的统治者？”一书的材料：在冶金工业方面，大公司的股金占所有冶金公司股金总额的81％；在煤炭工业方面，大公司的股金占90％；在石油方面竟占99％；在化学工业方面，法本化学公司的继承者——拜耳公司、赫希斯公司及巴登公司拥有的股金，比所有其他化学公司股金总额多三倍；在电气方面，八家大公司的股金占总额的82％，而西门子电气公司与西德的德国电气总公司的股金，就占总额的75％；三家大银行：德意志银行、德累斯登银行、商业银行控制了西德各类股金总额的55％，其余六十六家西德银行都受以上三家银行的影响。
    垄断组织操纵工业生产
    根据民主德国“经济周报”1957年的材料，西德工业集中的情况在1956年就已经十分显著：
    工业部门　康采恩数目　占该部门总产量（或贸易额）的百分比
    钢铁工业　9　93.9
    铁矿开采业　6　99.9
    硬煤开采业　9　69.9
    造船工业　6　73.6
    汽车工业　5　88.6
    化学工业　9　54.0
    石油开采业　5　95.1
    钾矿开采业　2　83.8
    电气工业　10　56.5
    为1955年的数字。
    今年8月8日，西德“议会政治新闻公报”指出，现在西德有八个主要的康采恩，控制了整个西德大约80％的铁和钢的生产和三分之一的煤的开采。这些垄断组织是：蒂森财团、克虏伯康采恩、弗利克康采恩、莱因联合钢铁厂、古特霍夫农炼铁厂、麦尼斯曼公司、赫施股份公司、克勒克内股份公司。
    阿登纳政府的基础
    西德垄断资本、银行资本、生产的集中，达到了空前的规模。垄断资本家在议会里、在政府中都有直接的代理人。德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼曾经指出，在本届联邦议院中，约有一百名议员是直接代表垄断资本、银行资本和批发商业的。他又指出，阿登纳同西德最大的康采恩之一——维尔汉康采恩有裙带关系，经济部长艾哈德来自“法本托辣斯”资助的经济联盟，原子发展部长巴尔克是化学工业的代表，外交部长勃伦塔诺是雷希林康采恩的代表，在原子发展部所属委员会中起领导作用的，是垄断资本的最知名的代表，如德意志银行，德国电气总公司，埃索公司——也就是美国洛克菲勒康采恩，法本托辣斯等企业的代表。
    西德和美国垄断资本家的资本和利益的彼此勾结，就是阿登纳政府的基础。
    为垄断资本鞠躬尽瘁
    阿登纳集团是一个彻头彻尾为垄断资本利益服务的集团。西德经营钢铁、煤及造船工业的一个大垄断组织古特霍夫农公司的总经理赫尔曼·雷依塞，早就代表垄断资本家叫嚷说：“现在的趋势是把国营的企业及其股份，转移到私人手中来。”
    在垄断资本家的压力下，西德政府以二千六百万马克的低价，把汉堡的国营豪瓦尔特造船厂出售给以多特蒙德—赫德尔钢铁厂为首的财团。莱因金属—色尔齐格股份公司是一个生产军器的工厂。第二次世界大战以后，由占领军接管。1951年，该工厂51.8％的股份被移交给西德政府。1956年，西德政府把它拥有的股份出售给雷希林康采恩。雷希林康采恩收买了这个公司以后，就把该公司在柏林的子公司——色尔齐格公司仍旧转售给西德政府。这是一笔稀奇古怪的交易。不过，后来莱因金属公司的一位负责人泄露了秘密。他说：“把色尔齐格公司转售给西德政府，对莱因金属公司与色尔齐格公司都有好处，因为色尔齐格公司一直赔累不堪。”原来，垄断资本家把无利可图的企业出售给政府，既可以摆脱累赘，又可以获得一笔补偿金，有利于进行其他的活动，从而获取更大的利润。

    作为主要资本主义国家之一的西德的情况，有力地证明了马克思列宁主义关于资本主义国家生产日益集中在少数人手中以及垄断资本加紧控制国家政治的学说是无比正确的。但是，现代修正主义者在谈到关于垄断资本与国家关系问题时，却说什么：“国家日益监督资本，部分地限制私人管理资本主义财产的权利，并剥夺私人资本所有者在经济和社会中的某些独立职能”，“垄断资本巨头在他们掌管的某些部门中日益丧失其原有的完全独立的作用，而垄断资本的某些职能在越来越大的程度上转交给国家”（见南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案）。现代修正主义者作出这种荒谬的论证，如果不是对现实的完全无知，那就是别有用心了。
