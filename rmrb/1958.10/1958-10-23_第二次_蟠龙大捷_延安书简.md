    The Second "Panlong Great Victory" – Letters from Yan'an
    Yan Ling
    "Thunder rumbles for a thousand miles, lightning flashes for ten thousand; at a single command, a total mobilization!" Suddenly, the steel industry was no longer so "mysterious" to the people of Yan'an. Although most people had no knowledge of iron smelting, or had even seen what an iron smelting furnace looked like, they enthusiastically stepped onto the forefront of the steel industry. The news of American pirates stirring up trouble on the coast of the East China Sea added even more excitement to the already excited hearts of the people. The people's communization of the entire county further increased people's confidence in their own strength.

    Tens of thousands of farmers suddenly turned into workers. They sent "representatives" carrying grain to learn how to build furnaces, smelt iron, and refine oil. When they returned, they taught even more people. Those who were used to handling hoes and sickles now had to pick up iron hooks and iron cones; hands accustomed to patting earth clods were now used to crush ore.

    The Panlong area was particularly bustling. The two people's communes here were the main battlegrounds of Yan'an's industrial front. The "Worker-Peasant People's Commune" lived up to its name; its industrial output would not only exceed its agricultural output in the future, but also be several times, even ten times, greater!

    The "Panlong Steelmaking Corps," with more than three thousand people, was organized. The original technical force guiding the masses in indigenous iron smelting was only twenty-odd people: eleven students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Jiaotong University and eleven apprentices from the newly established iron smelting plant. Now, the students and apprentices were also teachers; their students were already teachers as well.

    The cadres who were sent to lower levels would never have thought of engaging in industry in the past. When they were sent down, the meaning of "going up the mountains and down to the countryside" was to engage in agricultural production. But today, the meaning of "countryside" has changed. In Yan'an, two hundred and eighty-five cadres sent to lower levels have already been transferred to the industrial front.

    In the blink of an eye, hundreds of indigenous blast furnaces had "grown" in the mountains and fields. In the Mudan River valley, several indigenous furnace clusters quickly appeared. There, the women of Liang Village, who were always known for their active labor, questioned the commune cadres as to why they weren't allowed to participate in the battle to surpass England and catch up with America; they finally got the task of building a furnace and named it the "Women's Furnace" after it was built. In the Panlong River valley, the indigenous furnace clusters were also constantly increasing. Next to the Jade Emperor Temple, the members of a production team of the Worker-Peasant People's Commune arranged ten indigenous blast furnaces in a neat row; five were built of stone, and five were dug into the earth cliffs. They dug into the cliff in the manner of a lime kiln, lined the inside with white sandstone, and plastered it with self-made refractory mud, creating a truly "indigenous" blast furnace that was simple, labor-saving, and sturdy. It also had a great advantage: there was no need to build a bridge to add ore, which was both convenient and safe. Several old men and several old women and girls, here participated in the furnace construction project as happily and intensively as the young men. Words such as "baking the furnace," "furnace breast," and "refractoriness," which had been very unfamiliar to them a few days ago, were now spoken fluently.

    The first iron to flow out was from the indigenous blast furnace of the members of the Hejiagou team of the Worker-Peasant People's Commune. It ran ahead of the "foreign" furnace being built in Hejiagou, becoming the first red banner on Yan'an's steel front.

    Hejiagou did not fail its honor. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the Party Central Committee was in Yan'an, it smelted iron here. Now, walking into the valley covered with *malan* grass, one can still see the ruins of the indigenous furnaces where iron was once smelted to participate in the battle to defeat Japanese imperialism. The two tall old pear trees should be able to bear witness to how the iron here was sent out to participate in the battle to defeat Japanese imperialism.

    Not long ago, more than sixty Yan'an county and district cadres had a voluntary labor session in Hejiagou—mining ore. When we saw the red ore, buried underground for tens of thousands of years, being illuminated by the sun, we couldn't help but cheer. Coincidentally, in one area, we dug up a snake, a centipede, and a scorpion. I used the hoe for mining ore to kill them. Thinking that mining ore was fighting against imperialism, it was precisely them that appeared. Imperialism is nothing more than these things!

    "Heroes display their skills on the steel front,
    Great victories are achieved in the battle of Panlong;
    Three horses gallop day and night,
    Iron flows red all over the ground;
    Annual production is nearly ten thousand tons,
    Let it be a great satellite!"

    This is the slogan of the warriors on the Panlong steel front. Let us wait for the good news of another "Panlong Great Victory"!

    It is now midnight. Many mountain valleys in the Panlong area are illuminated like daytime by the furnace fire of iron smelting. Looking at the raging fire, looking at the stars in the northern sky, one can't help but think that this starlight should also be shining on Beijing City, the lights of Zhongnanhai? Leaders who often stay up late for the victory and happiness of the people, the new workers by the furnaces in the Yan'an mountains and fields entrust the Big Dipper to salute you!

    第二次“蟠龙大捷”——延安书简
    燕凌
    “千里的雷声万里的闪，一声号令总动员！”忽然间，钢铁工业对于延安的人们不再是那么“神秘”了。尽管绝大部分人都没有炼铁的知识，甚至没见过炼铁炉是什么样子，人们却那么热情地走上钢铁的最前线。美国海盗在东海之滨兴风作浪的消息，使人们激动着的心更添激动。全县的人民公社化，又使人们对自己的力量在信心上更添信心。
    成千成万农民，一下子变成了工人。他们派了“代表”背着粮食去学建炉，学炼铁，学炼油。回来，再教给更多的人。拿惯锄头、镰刀的人，也要拿起铁钩、铁锥来；惯于打
  土圪塔的手，正好用来敲碎矿石。
    蟠龙一带特别红火。这里的两个人民公社，是延安工业战线的主要阵地。“工农人民公社”名副其实，这里的工业产值以后不但要超过农业产值，而且要几倍、十几倍于农业产值呢！
    三千多人的“蟠龙钢铁兵团”组织起来了。原先指导群众土炉炼铁的技术力量只有二十几个人：交通大学机械系的十一个学生，刚成立的冶铁厂的十一个学徒。现在，学生和学徒也就是老师；他们的学生也已经又是老师了。
    下放干部，过去怎么也不会想到会搞工业。当他们下放的时候“上山下乡”的含义就是搞农业生产。而今天“农村”的含义已经变了。在延安的下放干部，已有二百八十五名转到工业战线上去。
    转眼间，成百土高炉已经在山野间“生长”出来。在牡丹川里，很快就出现好几个土炉群。在那里，向来以积极劳动闻名的梁村妇女，质问社干部为什么不让她们参加超英超美的战斗；终于把建炉任务分到手，建成后命名为“妇女炉”。在蟠龙川里，土炉群也在不断增加。在玉皇庙旁，工农人民公社的一个生产队的社员们让十个土高炉排成整整齐齐的一队；五个是用石头筑成的，五个是在土崖上挖成的。在崖上挖成石灰窑的样子，里面用白砂石一砌，用自造的耐火泥一抹，就成了又简便又省工又坚固的地地道道的“土”高炉。它还有一个最大的好处：添料石不必搭桥，又方便，又安全。几个老汉和几个婆姨、女子，在这里同年轻后生一样欢乐地紧张地参加建炉工程，“烘炉”“炉胸”“耐火度”等等几天以前对他们还非常生疏的字眼，现在已经在他们嘴里说得烂熟了。
    最先流出铁水来的是工农人民公社何家沟队的社员们的土高炉。它跑到了正在何家沟建设的“洋”炉子的前面，成为延安钢铁战线上的第一面红旗。
    何家沟没有亏负它的荣誉。抗日战争时期，党中央在延安的时候，就在这里炼过铁。现在，走进那长满了马兰的山谷，还可以看到当年炼铁的土炉子的遗址。两棵高大的老杜梨树该可以做见证人，这里的铁曾经怎样被送出去参加打败日本帝国主义的战斗。
    不久以前，延安县区干部六十多人曾在何家沟作过一次义务劳动——挖矿石。当看到多少万年埋藏在地下的红色的矿石被阳光照射着的时候，我们都情不自禁地欢笑起来。说也凑巧，在一片地方，我们一会儿挖出一条蛇、一条蚰蜒、一个蝎子。我就用挖矿石的镢头把它们打死了。想着挖矿石就是同帝国主义作斗争，偏偏它们就出现了。帝国主义，也不过就是这样一些东西！
    “钢铁战线逞英雄，
    蟠龙大战立奇功；
    三马齐上日夜赶，
    铁水奔流遍地红；
    年内生产近万吨，
    放它一个大卫星！”
    这就是蟠龙钢铁战线上的战士们的口号。让我们等待着再一次“蟠龙大捷”的喜报吧！
    现在正是夜半。蟠龙一带许多山沟被炼铁的炉火照耀得如同白昼。望望那熊熊的火光，望望北方天空的星斗，不由得想到，这星光也该正映照着北京城、中南海的灯光吧？为人民的胜利和幸福而经常深夜不眠的领袖们，延安山野炉旁的新工人们委托北斗星向你们致敬！
