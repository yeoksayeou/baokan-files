    Built a Railway with Our Own Hands

    The Mishan-Hulin Railway is the first railway in the Mishan reclamation area. This railway was built by the Mishan Reclamation Bureau of the Railway Corps and is a major transportation artery of the reclamation area. The railway is 101 kilometers long and construction began in March of this year, officially opening to traffic on August 25. The completion of the Mishan-Hulin Railway has made transportation more convenient in this vast reclamation area.

    The builders of the Mishan-Hulin line were mostly officers and soldiers transferred and demobilized from all over the country this year. These people had never built a railway before, but they built this road.

    The Mishan-Hulin line is a section of the railway they plan to build. The road construction team of the Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau is extending this line to Dahe Town. Currently, they are rushing to build the Hulin to Yingmentingzi section. This section is 33 kilometers long. The members of the road construction team are determined to complete and open to traffic by the end of December this year, so that the timber from the Great Northern Wilderness can participate in the construction of the motherland as soon as possible.

    用自己的双手修了铁路
    密（山）虎（林）铁路是密山垦区的第一条铁路。这条铁路是铁道兵密山农垦局修筑的，是一条垦区的交通运输大动脉。这条铁路全长一百零一公里，由今年3月动工兴建，8月25日正式通车。密虎铁路的修通，使这个辽阔的垦区的交通更加便利了。
    密虎线修筑者绝大部分是今年由全国各地转业、复员来的官兵。这些人根本没有修过铁路，可是这条路就是他们修成的。
    密虎线是它们计划修筑的铁路的一段，铁道兵农垦局筑路大队正在进行延长这条线到大和镇的工程。目前正突击修建虎林至迎门顶子段。这段线长三十三公里。筑路大队的队员们决心争取在今年12月底完工通车，以便让北大荒的木材早日参加祖国建设。（附图片）
