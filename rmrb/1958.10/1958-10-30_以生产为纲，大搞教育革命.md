Taking Production as the Key Link and Vigorously Launching an Educational Revolution
Li Jinghe, Secretary of the CPC Committee of Luoyang Normal College

    In order to fulfill the steel production tasks assigned to us by the Party, all the teachers and students of our Luoyang Normal College left the school in September and entered the steel production site. In more than a month, we worked and studied with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and gained a deeper understanding that to implement the Party’s policy of “combining education with production” and “education serving proletarian politics,” we must move the classroom out of the school and into the production site, bring learning into production, and combine studying with productive labor. When the Party initially proposed “on-site teaching,” there was resistance of varying degrees from both inside and outside the Party. They believed that teaching on the construction site was not understanding teaching, was unprofessional, and that moving the university to the countryside did not look like a university, believing that “there is no valuable knowledge in labor.” The fundamental idea was to despise the leadership of the Party, not to believe in the people, and to disagree with the policy of combining education with production and education serving proletarian politics. Some also said: "Politics, labor, and professional work are three separate entities, and they should be assigned and responsible for their own work. Politics belongs to the Party, professional work belongs to me, and labor has nothing to do with the school. There is no politics in teaching at all." Some "onlookers" and "skeptics" insisted on the old-style bourgeois norms in the study and formulation of teaching syllabuses, and persisted in their opinions after many debates, saying that this teaching method would disrupt the "systematic nature of knowledge," saying that "mathematics is a hard thing, and classes must be in the classroom." We said that our scientific nature is fundamentally different from the dogmatic scientific nature of the bourgeoisie, so disrupting the "systematic nature" is disrupting the systematic nature of the bourgeoisie, which should be disrupted and must be disrupted. There were also some people who insisted on bourgeois teaching theories, who superficially supported but inwardly resisted during the debate, which was manifested in negative preparation for lessons, emphasizing difficulties, and emphasizing that normal education can only train teachers, and does not require practical knowledge of production and labor training. The vast number of teachers and students who demanded progress resolutely opposed this view, saying: "Those who are truly knowledgeable and experienced are not necessarily intellectuals, but precisely the workers who have participated in production practice." At the same time, they put forward the example that students collectively researched and made 17 kinds of explosives in a month, which made those teachers speechless. We have always actively supported the correct opinions in the debate between two different ideas. After full debate and practice, many vivid facts criticized those who insisted on bourgeois viewpoints. Some people made self-criticisms. Liu Shiwu, a teacher in the Chemistry Department, publicly said to everyone: "I have been teaching for twenty years, and now I really don't know what ore is." Some also said, "This time I will make up for my lack (practical knowledge) by studying with the students in labor." At the same time, in organizing the struggle between the two ideologies, we also realized that carrying out the education revolution is not only a change in the education system, but also a thorough transformation of ideological consciousness. Although the debate has not completely ended, the face of the school has changed. This shows that our approach is correct. The skepticism of all "accountants" and "onlookers" and the special theory of normal education have begun to shake and become isolated. During production and rest, the air is filled with reading newspapers, creating, singing, and learning. Students said: "Learning promotes labor, and labor promotes learning. It's really a good classroom. We will never go back." Therefore, we must build on our achievements, advance victoriously, firmly rely on the masses, and adhere to the Party's line and policies, so that the socialist revolution in education can achieve a complete victory.
    We believe that to implement the combination of education and productive labor, the furnace side is a very good classroom, and education should serve the politics of the proletariat, and vigorously developing steel is the biggest socialist politics. Therefore, on the one hand, we resolutely implemented on-site classes and implemented the "three sides" (side production, side learning, side debate) and "three combinations" (labor, learning, scientific research), which greatly satisfied the demands of the masses. They excitedly composed poems and rhythmic rhymes to express praise, saying: "We have many forms of class, part-work and part-study is very flexible, more labor when production is tight, more classes when labor is not tight. Newly compiled lecture notes are good teaching materials, refining iron and refining people are blooming, workers, peasants and experts talk about technology, theory and practice come together. Furnace side construction site debate, military training and production team, rich life and more creation, painting, dancing and singing. Factory machine sound farm songs, universities and schools of all sizes do a lot, teachers and students are red and expert all-rounders, strive for models on the leap forward road." This is an even more sharp struggle between two roads and two methods in the actual process. Those with negative resistance are still going through the motions in teaching, which further helps us to mobilize the masses, deepen the debate, and gradually expose the problems in the depths of our minds more thoroughly. Teachers who were not ideologically clear had not compiled a lecture in five days. In the preparation of the teaching plan, teachers and students were organized to express their opinions freely, and everyone started to compile the teaching syllabus, so that politics could take command, and red flags could be inserted in every course to pull out the white flags of the bourgeoisie. Our principles for reviewing and compiling lecture notes are: ① It can embody the Party's educational policy, combining theory with practice, ② It has a dialectical materialist viewpoint, ③ It is closely integrated with production. The current key is how to promote the great leap forward in steel production and solve the problems in production technology. In the Department of Literature and History, mainly socialist literature and writing, literature and history, and Chinese are offered. In the content arrangement of the history class, we have adopted a social development history centered on steel, explaining that the development of steel promotes the development of productive forces, as well as the economic and political significance of steel in the current socialist construction, establishing students' production and labor viewpoints, and also educating and enlightening them to actively participate in productive labor.
    In the literature class, in addition to first clarifying the role of literary works in terms of theoretical viewpoints, that the workers and peasants are the source of literary works, and that works are the reflection and expression of the writer's world outlook and outlook on life, and how literature serves political production, etc.; teachers should actively organize students to participate in actual life creation, and conduct on-site meetings, conduct knowledge dissemination in terms of work evaluation, creation skills, and writing methods. In this way, the students' enthusiasm for creation has been greatly developed, fundamentally changing the old system of writing once every two weeks, and writing more than 11,000 poems, essays, comic dialogues, and rhythmic rhymes in a month, which were quickly compiled into "Poetry Collections" such as:
    There are many trains on the Longhai Line, the trains come and go like shuttles,
    The trains carry tens of thousands of tons of cargo, which cannot carry all my harvest song. Another example:
    The east wind runs for thousands of miles in the clear sky, the Chinese people are showing their heroism,
    Point to the mountains and the mountains turn green, point to the water and the water becomes clear,
    The eastern giant dragon soars in the clear sky, and the western snake ghosts fall upside down.
    In terms of literary and artistic creation, they all promoted the heroic miracles of socialism.
    In the Department of Physics and Chemistry, according to the current needs of steel production, mixed lectures on chemical and physical knowledge were conducted, and five parts were compiled, including explosives ore dressing, ironmaking and steelmaking, and heat engines. In addition to using real objects for on-site visits and operations, various raw materials were also concentrated for exhibitions, so that students not only had theoretical knowledge, but also learned many practical skills. For example, there are now 100 people who can master all the technologies of native blast furnace production, 15 people who can master mining and blasting, 50 people who can master ore dressing knowledge, and 295 people who can master coking technology. In the smelting process, it was found that the refractoriness of the crucible was only 1,200 degrees, which affected the progress of production. After painstaking research, everyone improved the mixing method, and finally made the refractoriness reach 1,800 degrees, and increased the technology of making crucibles from 20 per day to one per minute. At the same time, the lecture time of the course was greatly shortened, the homework was reduced, the actual time was increased, and the knowledge learned was consolidated. In the music class, teachers could study and sing with students while transporting and eating. In the fine arts class, there were field sketches, and in the physical education class, in addition to the technical skills that could not be combined and needed fixed time practice, many projects were combined with production. The ironmaking bellows exercised the students' arm strength. It is true: production labor is blooming, and knowledge comes from production.
    Taking classes on the construction site and implementing "the combination of education and productive labor", the principle discussed by everyone is "where production is, where learning is, the construction site is the school, and the furnace side is the classroom", requiring teachers and students to teach and learn well, to ensure the completion of steel production tasks, and to check the teaching quality by the leap forward of each link of steel production. Compile lecture notes based on local materials, and collectively study to give play to the wisdom of the masses. When teaching specialized practical experience and technology, the form is that teachers and students prepare lessons together, learn from practice together, and those who are capable are teachers, inviting local experts and technicians to teach, teachers teach, and students can also teach. For example, in the process of trial production of yellow explosives in the chemical plant of our college, several students boldly researched and personally operated to make 17 kinds of explosives of various colors. Therefore, when chemistry talks about the role of explosives in the national economy, the students completely compiled the lecture notes on the development process, production process, performance, use, and storage methods of explosives, and also gave lectures on making explosives to the students of the Department of Physics and Chemistry, and conducted experiments on blasting at the mine. The Department of Literature and History also invited newspaper reporters to talk about how to write news. The students are very satisfied with this teaching method, because this breaks the old method of only allowing teachers to speak and students to listen, and forms a new teaching style of teachers and students conducting research together. However, there is also a struggle on this issue, because there is no fixed classroom now, and at the same time, due to the tension of vigorously developing steel and the diversity of jobs, there are contradictions in the arrangement of labor, learning, and rest time; teachers' labor production and lesson preparation also have contradictions; some students also form a problem of not studying hard and not getting good grades because of these problems; some only study hard and are unwilling to participate in production labor. In solving these contradictions, the main thing is to strengthen ideological education and do a good job in organizational work, induce learning, and correctly understand the consistency of learning, labor, and production. Each department has formulated a teaching plan, and there are also short-term collective arrangements, so that the courses are closely combined with production, such as how long to work in half a month, how long to study, how long to rest, teachers and students should have a good idea in advance. In addition, all teachers and students helped workers and the masses to run 41 classes of senior, middle, and elementary schools, and students also compiled textbooks for arithmetic (eight units) and Chinese thirty lessons based on the practical knowledge in production labor. Through teaching reform and the struggle of two roads, it is affirmed that the mass line in teaching must also be a great release, a great contention, and a great debate. Criticism and self-criticism among teachers and students have gradually formed an atmosphere. Teachers have also gone deep into the students and achieved "four sames" (same eating, same living, same labor, same research) and "two changes" (changing the students' inability to criticize teachers, changing the classroom method of only lecturing and not discussing) and "four strengthening" (strengthening collective lesson preparation, strengthening mutual cooperation among teachers, strengthening in-depth guidance, and strengthening political and ideological work). Although some methods have been created in the teaching mode, there are still many problems that need further research.
    Our experience in implementing the education policy and taking classes on the spot is: ① Politics is the commander, ideology is the soul, and all work can only guarantee victory in politics and ideology by firmly implementing the Party's line, policies, and guidelines under the leadership of the Party. In politics, only by grasping the struggle between the two roads can the Party's line and policies be correctly implemented. There is a struggle between two roads in our ideology with the bourgeoisie, so we should constantly conduct situation tasks for the masses and conduct education on collectivism and communism. The main form of our political work is to adopt a full range of great release, great contention, great debate, and big-character posters, which is the basic one. ② Let go of mobilizing the masses and believe in the masses. In carrying out the large-scale education revolution, there is no mass movement in which everyone participates, that is, the change will not be thorough. Some people say that we do not understand education. We admit that we are not education experts, and our experience in running socialist education is also insufficient. But the important thing is that we adhere to the Party's policies. In the process of continuous debate and continuous practice, the vast majority of teachers and students have improved, so everyone is in a good mood. In collective life, teachers and students take advantage of any gaps to harvest autumn, turn the land, sing propaganda, and carry out various cultural and entertainment activities with the masses, which also enriches the life content of the masses.

    以生产为纲，大搞教育革命
    中共洛阳师范学院党委书记　李景合
    我们洛阳师范学院的全体师生，为完成党交给我们的钢铁生产任务，于9月份远离学校，进入了钢铁生产工地。在一个多月中，我们和广大工农群众一起生产劳动，上课学习，更深刻地认识到要贯彻党的
  “教育与生产相结合”“教育为无产阶级政治服务”的方针，就只有把课堂搬出校门，进入生产工地，把学习带进生产，使读书与生产劳动结合在一起。党在一开始提出“工地教学”的时候，从党内到党外都存在着不同程度的抵触情绪，他们认为，在工地上课是不懂得教学、是外行，把大学搬到农村，这就不像个大学的样子，认为“劳动中没有什么可贵的知识”。根本的思想是轻视党的领导，不相信人民群众，不同意教育结合生产，不同意教育为无产阶级政治服务的方针。也有的说：“政治、劳动、业务是三家，要分工负责，政治是党的，业务是我的，至于劳动与学校是无关的，教学中根本没有政治。”一些“观潮派”和“怀疑论”者，在研究制定教学大纲中坚持资产阶级旧型正规，多次辩论仍坚持己见，说这种教学方法会打乱“知识的系统性”，说“数学是硬性东西，上课必须在教室里”。我们说我们的科学性与资产阶级教条主义的科学性是有根本不同的，所以打乱“系统性”，是打乱了资产阶级的系统性，这是应该打乱和必须要打乱的。还有些坚持资产阶级教学理论的人，在辩论过程中表面拥护，内心抵触，表现在备课中消极，强调困难，强调师范教育只能是培养教师，是不需要生产实际知识和劳动锻炼的。广大要求进步的师生，坚决地反对了这种意见，他们说：“真正有知识有经验的不一定都是知识分子，恰恰是参加了生产实践的劳动者。”同时，把学生们经过一个月的集体钻研制出了十七种炸药等事例提出来，说得那些教师无言对答。我们在两种不同的思想争论中是始终积极的支持了正确意见。经过充分辩论和实践，许多生动的事实，批判了坚持资产阶级论点的人。有的人进行自我批判，化学系教师刘世五公开向大家说：
  “我已经教了二十年的课，现在真正啥是矿石我还不认得”，也有人表示“这次要和学生一起在劳动学习中补起自己缺少的一面
  （实际知识）”。同时我们在组织两种思想的斗争中，也体会到进行教育革命，不仅是教育制度的改变，而且必须是思想意识的彻底改造。目前辩论虽然还没有完全结束，但学校的面貌已发生了变化。这就说明了我们的做法是正确的。一切“算账派”“观潮派”的怀疑论和师范教育的特殊论，已开始动摇孤立。在生产、休息中，到处都充满了读报、创作、唱歌和学习的空气。学生说：“学习带动了劳动，劳动又推动了学习，真是一个好课堂，我们永远不再回去了。”因此，我们要在已获成绩的基础上，乘胜前进，坚决依靠群众，坚持党的方针路线，使教育中的社会主义革命获得彻底的胜利。
    我们认为要贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合，炉旁就是很好的课堂，教育要为无产阶级的政治服务，大办钢铁就是社会主义最大的政治。因此，一方面我们坚决执行了就地上课，实行了“三边”（边生产，边学习，边辩论），“三结合”（劳动、学习、科学研究），这样大大的满足了群众的要求，他们激动地编诗歌、快板表示赞扬说：“我们上课形式多，半工半读很灵活，生产紧时多劳动，劳动不紧多上课。新编讲义好教材，炼铁炼人百花开，工农专家讲技术，理论实际合拢来。炉旁工地辩论会，练兵习武生产队，生活丰富创作多，绘画跳舞和唱歌。工厂机声农场歌，大中小学办的多，师生红专多面手，跃进道上争楷模。”这样在实际过程中更是两条道路两种方法的针锋相对的斗争。有消极抵触情绪的人，在教学上仍然是走形式走过场，这样也就更进一步帮助我们发动群众，使辩论更加深入，使思想深处的问题也逐渐暴露得更透彻。思想不通的教师，五天还没有编出一课讲义。在编写教学计划中，组织了师生一齐鸣放，人人动手编写教学大纲，要使政治挂帅，门门课程插上红旗，拔掉资产阶级的白旗。我们审查编写讲义的原则是：①能体现党的教育方针，理论联系实际，②具有辩证唯物主义观点，③紧密的结合生产。当前的关键是如何推动钢铁生产的大跃进，解决生产技术中的问题，在文史系主要开设了社会主义文学与写作、文史、汉语等。在历史课的内容安排上又采取了以钢铁为中心的社会发展史，说明钢铁的发展推动生产力的发展，以及钢铁在目前社会主义建设中的经济意义和政治意义，树立学生的生产观点和劳动观点，也教育启发他们积极参加生产劳动。
    文学课除了在理论观点上首先讲清文学作品的作用，工农群众是文学作品的源泉，作品是作家世界观和人生观的反映和表现，文学如何为政治生产服务等外；教师要积极组织学生参加实际生活创作，通过召开现场会议，进行作品评比、创作技巧、写作方法等方面的知识传授。这样一来，学生的创作积极性得到大大的发扬，从根本上改变了过去两周作一次文的旧制度，一个月中就写了一万一千多篇诗歌、散文、相声、快板，很快的就汇编成“诗歌集”如：
    陇海路上列车多，列车往来如穿梭，
    列车纵载万吨货，载不完我的丰收歌。又如：
    东风万里奔晴空，中国人民逞英雄，
    指山山变绿，指水水变清，
    东方巨龙腾晴空，西方蛇鬼倒栽葱。
    在文艺创作方面都宣扬了社会主义的英雄奇迹。
    在理化课中，根据当前钢铁生产的需要，进行了化学物理知识的混合讲授，编写了炸药选矿、炼铁炼钢、热机等五部分，除利用实物进行现场参观和操作外，又集中了各种原料进行展览，这样学生不仅有了理论知识，还学到了许多实际技能，比如，现在能掌握土高炉生产全部技术的一百人，采矿爆破的十五人，能掌握选矿知识的五十人，能掌握炼焦技术的二百九十五人，在冶炼中发现坩埚耐火力只有一千二百度，影响生产的进行，大家苦心钻研，改进了配料方法，最后使耐火力达到了一千八百度，并把制坩埚的技术由每天二十个提高到每分钟一个。同时大大缩短了课程的讲授时间，作业减少了，实际时间增加了，学到的知识巩固了。音乐课在运输中吃饭中，教师都能和学生一块进行研究歌唱。美术课进行了野外写生，体育课除不能结合的技术需固定时间练习外，不少项目都结合生产进行，炼铁拉风箱锻炼了学生的臂力，真是：生产劳动百花开，知识都从生产来。
    在工地上课，实行“教育和生产劳动相结合”，大家讨论的原则是“生产在哪里，学习在哪里，工地是学校，炉旁是课堂”，要求师生教好学好，保证钢铁生产任务的完成，以钢铁生产各个环节的跃进来检查教学质量，就地取材编写讲义，集体研究发挥群众智慧。在讲授专门实际经验技术时，形式上是师生一齐备课，共同向实际学习，能者为师，请土专家、技术员讲，教师讲，学生也可以讲。如：我院化工厂在黄色炸药的试制过程中，几个同学大胆的钻研，亲自操作制成各色炸药十七种。因此化学中讲炸药在国民经济中的作用时，完全由学生编写了炸药的发展经过、制作过程以及性能、用途、保管方法的讲义，也给理化系学生进行了讲授制炸药和到矿山爆破的试验，文史系还请了新闻记者讲了如何写新闻的方法。同学们对这种教学方法非常满意，因为这是打破了只准教师讲学生听的老办法，形成了师生共同研究的新教学风格。但是，在这一问题上也是有斗争的，因为现在还没有定型的课堂，同时由于大办钢铁的紧张和工种的多样性，因此在劳动、学习、休息的时间安排上，也都各有各方面的矛盾；教师劳动生产与备课也有矛盾；有的学生也因这些问题形成学习不努力、成绩不好；也有只钻研学习不愿参加生产劳动。在解决这些矛盾中，主要是加强了思想教育作好组织工作，诱导学习，正确的认识学习劳动生产的一致性。各科系制定了教学计划，并又有短期的集体安排，把课程与生产紧密的结合起来，如半月内劳动多长时间，学习多长时间，休息多长时间，预先师生都要心中有数。另外全体师生帮助职工群众办了高、中、小学四十一班，学生也根据生产劳动中的实际知识编写了算术（八个单元）语文三十课的教材，通过教学改革和两条道路的斗争，肯定了教学中的群众路线也要大鸣大放大争大辩。师生中的批评与自我批评已渐形成空气。教师也深入了学生，作到了“四同”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究）“两改”（改变学生不能批评教师、改变只讲授不讨论的课堂办法）“四加强”（加强了集体备课，加强了教师互相协作，加强了深入辅导，加强了政治思想工作），虽然在教学方式中创作了一些办法，但还有许多问题需要进一步的研究。
    在贯彻教育方针就地上课中我们的体会是：①政治是统帅，思想是灵魂，一切工作只有在党的领导下，坚定的贯彻执行党的方针政策路线，才能保证在政治上思想上的胜利，在政治上也只有抓住两条道路的斗争，才能使党的方针政策正确的贯彻执行，我们在思想上同资产阶级存在着两条道路的斗争，因此我们应对群众不断的进行形势任务，进行集体主义共产主义的教育。我们政治工作的主要形式，是采取充分的大鸣、大放、大争、大辩、大字报，这是基本的一条。②放手的发动群众，相信群众，在开展大规模的教育革命中没有人人都参加的群众运动，即是改也不会彻底，有人说我们不懂教育，我们承认，不是教育专家，而且在办社会主义教育中经验也是不足的。但重要的是我们坚持的是党的政策。在不断辩论，不断实践的过程中，绝大多数的教师学生都有了提高，所以大家心情舒畅。在集体生活中，师生一有空隙就同群众一起收秋、翻地，唱歌宣传，开展各种文化娱乐活动，也丰富了群众的生活内容。
