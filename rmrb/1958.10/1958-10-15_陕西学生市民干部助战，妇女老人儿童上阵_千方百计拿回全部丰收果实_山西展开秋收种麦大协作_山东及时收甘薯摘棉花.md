Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th. Shaanxi Province is mobilizing all the people to seize the autumn harvest day and night. Various effective measures are also being taken to carefully harvest and thresh, striving to bring back all the fruits of this year's bumper harvest. Currently, corn and rice have been basically harvested throughout the province, cotton has generally been picked two or three times, and the harvesting of millet has entered its climax.

This year, the total output of various autumn crops in Shaanxi Province has increased by one and a half times compared to last year, and the amount of harvesting work has greatly increased. However, more than half of the province's labor force is currently engaged in deep plowing and iron smelting. In order to solve the current labor shortage, from the beginning of September, primary and secondary schools in various places have suspended classes one after another, with more than three million students returning to their hometowns to participate in production. More than 700,000 urban residents have also gone to nearby rural areas to engage in field labor, and 300,000 to 400,000 government cadres have also participated in the autumn harvest. In addition, all the elderly and children have been mobilized to participate in auxiliary labor, and measures such as "women replacing men" and "the weak replacing the strong" have been adopted to replace all the able-bodied men and women in canteens, feeding rooms, and nurseries. Various autumn harvest professional teams have been formed according to the strength of the labor force, and assembly line operations are implemented, making the harvesting efficiency twice as high as in previous years.

In the process of harvesting, inspection teams have been generally organized in various parts of Guanzhong to conduct inspections in the harvested farmland to ensure that every grain returns home. In Hu County, a county with a corn yield of 1,000 catties per mu, because the corn yield this year has increased by two times compared to last year, many farmers in some areas are indulging in the joy of the bumper harvest. At the beginning of the harvest, the phenomenon of dropping ears and grains was very common. The county leaders immediately proposed to correct it. The Dongfanghong, Jufeng, and Zuan communes also held on-site meetings to criticize typical examples of local grain spillage and launched debates among commune members to formulate improvement measures. After that, more than 2,000 autumn harvest assault teams in the county organized inspection teams to inspect the back of the harvesting work. According to a survey of four production teams: the gleaned ears of grain per mu can yield two to three catties of grain. This item alone can avoid the loss of about 400,000 catties of grain throughout the county. In Jingyang and Gaoling counties, in addition to rushing to harvest autumn crops, 50,000 to 60,000 farmers go to the fields to pick cotton every day, delivering meals to the fields during the day and rushing to harvest with lanterns at night. Red flag competitions are also launched in various places to strive for each person to "pick 100 catties of cotton per day." In Lintong County, more than 20,000 elderly people and 60,000 students formed more than 2,000 cotton picking groups. Since the end of September, they have picked cotton five times, collecting more than 60 million catties of seed cotton, with an average of more than 80 catties of lint cotton picked per mu.

The 1.9 million mu of rice in Hanzhong Prefecture, southern Shaanxi, has now been rushed to harvest. Farmers are trying their best to reduce losses. Rice stalks are cut shorter than in the past, and the act of cutting rice is also lighter than in the past, first avoiding spillage losses in the fields. Every evening, the harvesting teams carry the rice stalks back, carefully walking over the field ridges and small bridges, and the children follow behind to pick up the lost ears of grain. In order to thresh cleanly, threshing machines have been widely promoted in various places. At night, under the moonlight, the threshing grounds are filled with the sound of "da da da," which can be heard in every village. According to the survey: threshing with a threshing machine can harvest five to ten catties of rice per mu more than mixing and threshing in the past. In Yulin Prefecture along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi, more than 10 million mu of autumn fields have also been basically harvested. More than 100,000 farmers in Zizhou, Mizhi, Jingbian and other counties formed assault teams to rush to harvest day and night in shifts, and after seven days and seven nights of hard work, they have rushed to bring 70% of the autumn crops from various counties to the threshing ground.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th. Shanxi's autumn harvest and autumn planting have entered the most intense stage. In recent days, the three labor armies of more than 4 million farmers in the province, composed of autumn harvesting, wheat planting, and deep plowing, have been fighting the final assault battle day and night. They are determined to harvest more than 40 million mu of major autumn crops and plant more than 14 million mu of wheat within half a month.

During the tense season of autumn harvest and wheat planting, cadres from leadership departments at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels have gone to the fields. The widespread labor shortage problem in various places has been temporarily resolved through reasonable arrangements and allocation, the implementation of cooperation between counties and communes, and the mobilization of social labor to provide support.

As of the 9th, more than 8.2 million mu of wheat have been sown throughout the province, and the sowing quality is better than in any previous year. More than 80% of the 40 million mu of major autumn crops such as millet, sorghum, corn, and cotton throughout the province have also been harvested.

In the tense autumn harvest and wheat planting activities, communist cooperation has been widely launched in various places, with a total of more than 1.48 million people participating in cooperative labor. Recently, cadres, students, workers, and urban residents from towns and cities have been harvesting crops and planting wheat alongside farmers. Various places in the province have also organized cooperation between regions. The number of people participating in cooperative labor in each prefecture is generally around 100,000. Some people drive livestock, carry tools, and bring seeds, doing whatever is needed to make up for what is lacking, and helping areas with more difficulties. Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping and other counties in Changzhi Prefecture, which have heavy steel production tasks, are short of labor in the autumn harvest and wheat planting. At this time, under the unified organization and guidance of the prefectural leadership organs, Huguan, Licheng, and Tuncang counties, which have smaller steel production tasks, faster progress in autumn harvest, and more labor, drew more than 8,000 commune members and formed an expeditionary cooperative group to come and help. Jinzhong and Jinnan regions have also widely launched large-scale labor cooperation between mountainous and plain areas, and between wheat-producing and non-wheat-producing areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th. Farmers in Shandong Province are stepping up their efforts to harvest sweet potatoes (sweet potatoes, same below) and pick cotton.

Generally, various places have broken the habit of not harvesting until after the frost, and began harvesting sweet potatoes after the Autumn Equinox. Six prefectures, including Linyi, Liaocheng, and Jining, have already harvested more than 280,000 mu. Many areas have made detailed arrangements from sweet potato harvesting and storage to comprehensive utilization.

Cotton harvesting and transportation work has attracted great attention in various places. Bin County, where the total cotton output will increase by more than four times compared to last year, now sends out more than 60,000 people every day to pick new cotton, ensuring timely cotton harvesting and delivery. In Gaotang County, due to the organization of more than 30,000 specialized cotton-picking troops and the implementation of sub-area contracting and quantitative, qualitative, personal, timely, and plot-based methods, the progress and quality of cotton picking have been improved. Various places have also taken measures to ensure that the fruits of labor that are about to be obtained are not damaged by frost. (Attached pictures)

    陕西学生市民干部助战，妇女老人儿童上阵
    千方百计拿回全部丰收果实
    山西展开秋收种麦大协作　山东及时收甘薯摘棉花
    新华社西安13日电　陕西省全民总动员，昼夜抢收秋田，各地还采取有效措施，细收细打，争取把今年的丰收果实全部拿回来。目前，全省的玉米、水稻已基本收割完毕，棉花普遍拾过两至三次，谷子的收割已进入高潮。
    今年陕西省各种秋田作物总产量比去年增加一倍半，收割工作量大大增多，但目前全省有一半以上的劳动力正在进行深翻地和炼铁，为了解决当前的劳力紧张问题，从9月初开始，各地中小学校先后停课，有三百多万学生回乡参加生产，有七十多万城镇市民也到附近农村从事田间劳动，还有三、四十万机关干部也参加秋收。此外，各地还发动全部老人和儿童参加辅助劳动，并采取“以女替男”、“以弱替强”的办法，把食堂、饲养室和托儿所里的男女全劳力替换出来，按照劳力强弱分别组成各种秋收专业队，实行流水作业，使收割效率比往年提高了一倍。
    关中各地在收割过程中普遍组织了检查组，在收过的庄稼地里进行检查，做到颗粒还家。玉米千斤丰产县——鄠县，由于今年玉米产量比去年增加了两倍，有不少地区的农民沉醉在丰收的狂欢里，收割开始时遗穗掉粒的现象很普遍。县领导上立即提出纠正。东方红、巨风和祖安等公社还分别以当地抛洒粮食的典型事例，召开现场会议进行批判，并发动社员展开辩论，订出改进办法。此后，全县两千多个秋收突击队，分别组织了检查组，前边收割、后边检查。根据四个生产队调查：每亩地拾回的遗穗可剩粮食两三斤，仅此一项，全县共可避免损耗的粮食约四十多万斤。泾阳、高陵两县农民们除突击收秋外，每天有五、六万人上地拾棉花，白天送饭到地，夜晚提灯抢收，各地还展开红旗竞赛，争取每人“日拾百斤棉”。临潼县有两万名老人和六万名学生组成两千多个拾花组，从9月下旬开始拾花，现已拾过五次，共拾回籽棉六千多万斤，平均每亩已拾回皮棉八十多斤。
    陕南汉中专区的一百九十万亩水稻，现已抢收完毕。农民们想尽一切办法减少损耗。稻秆比过去割的更矮，割稻的动作也比过去轻了，首先避免了田间的抛洒损失。每当傍晚，收割队挑着稻株回来，小心翼翼地走过田塍和小桥，小孩们跟在后边把丢失的穗头也拾了回来。为了摔光打净，各地普遍推广了打稻机。晚上月光下，打稻场上一片“哒哒哒”的声音，村村相闻。据调查：用打稻机脱粒比过去拌搅摔打，每亩可多收稻谷五至十斤。陕北长城沿线的榆林专区，一千多万亩秋田也已基本收完，子洲、米脂、靖边等县十多万农民，组成突击队轮流日夜抢收，苦战七天七夜已把各县70％的秋田庄稼抢到场上。
    据新华社太原14日电　山西秋收、秋种已进入最紧张的阶段。连日来，全省四百多万农民组成的秋收、种麦、深翻地三支劳动大军，披星戴月进行最后的突击战。他们决心在半个月内，收完四千多万亩大秋作物，种好一千四百多万亩小麦。
    在秋收种麦的紧张时节，省、专、县各级领导部门的干部纷纷出动，深入田间。各地普遍存在的劳力缺乏问题，经过合理安排和调配，实行县与县、社与社之间的协作，以及动员社会上的劳力支援，已暂时得到解决。
    到9日为止，全省播种小麦已达八百二十多万亩，播种质量也比过去任何一年都好。全省四千多万亩谷子、高粱、玉米、棉花等大秋作物，也已收割80％。
    在紧张的秋收、种麦活动中，各地普遍展开了共产主义大协作，参加协作劳动的共有一百四十八万多人。近日来自城镇的干部、学生、职工和市民已经同农民并肩抢收庄稼和播种小麦。全省各地还组织了地区之间的协作。每个专区参加协作劳动的人数一般在十万左右，有些人赶着牲畜、扛着工具、带着种籽，做到了缺什么补什么，帮助困难较多的地区。长治专区钢铁生产任务较大的晋城、阳城、高平等县在秋收和种麦中劳力不足，这时在专区领导机关统一组织指导下，钢铁生产任务较小、秋收进步较快，而且劳力多的壶关、黎城、屯长三个县便抽出八千多名社员，组成远征协作团，前来帮助。晋中和晋南地区也普遍展开了山区和平原、产麦区和非产麦区之间的劳力大协作。
    据新华社济南14日电　山东省农民正加紧收刨地瓜（甘薯，下同）和采摘棉花。
    各地一般都打破了往年不到霜降不收刨的习惯，从秋分后就开始收刨地瓜。临沂、聊城、济宁等六个专区，已经收刨了二十八万多亩。许多地区从地瓜收获、贮藏到综合利用都作了细致的安排。
    棉花收运工作已引起各地很大重视。棉花总产量将比去年增长四倍多的滨县，现在每天出动采摘新棉的大军达六万多人，保证了棉花及时采摘和交售。高唐县由于组织了三万多名拾棉专业大军，又实行了分片包干和定质、定量、定人、定时、定地块的办法，拾棉进度和质量都有提高。各地还采取了措施，争取即将到手的劳动果实不遭霜冻。（附图片）
