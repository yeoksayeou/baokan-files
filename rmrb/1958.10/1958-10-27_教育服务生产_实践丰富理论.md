Education Service Production Enriches Theory with Practice

Shaanxi: Schools Run Factories and Farms
Inner Mongolia: Schools Establish Large Pastures
Yunnan: Classrooms Move into Mines

In Shaanxi, schools are linked with 32 counties and 5,397 units. Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an campus) supports the construction of Yan'an area. By the end of August, it had established 34 steel factories and 5,102 indigenous blast furnaces, and trained more than 3,000 technicians. Teachers and students of Wugong Water Conservancy School supported agricultural production. After eight months of hard work, they assisted the province in expanding the irrigation area by more than 5 million mu, equivalent to 1.4 times the irrigation area of the entire province before liberation. In the agricultural mechanization movement in the province, 11 universities and colleges in Xi'an manufactured more than 20,000 sets of large vehicle bearings, more than 34,000 sets of cart bearings, more than 24,000 diesel engines, and modified more than 2,900 waterwheels. Schools at all levels have assisted localities in setting up more than 230,000 schools of various types.

People have seen the industrial products of schools across the province, including all kinds of steel, iron, lathes, electronic computers, radios, pharmaceuticals, etc. Secondary schools and above in the province have established more than 5,000 factories. The products of the 13 universities and colleges alone have more than 3,600 varieties, and some have reached or exceeded international standards. At the exhibition, there are dazzling agricultural production achievements on display, including fruit towers stacked with huge fruits, grain towers, melon towers… Secondary schools and above across the province planted more than 61,000 mu of farmland and are conducting various experiments. Here in Inner Mongolia, all schools have established pastures and raised livestock. Alshan Primary School in Hulunbuir League alone raises more than 6,000 head of livestock. These schools have also established many factories, producing livestock products and industrial products such as milk powder, dried milk crusts, cream, cheese skin, cheese curd, wool, felt, and leather products.

Inner Mongolia's higher education institutions have vigorously carried out teaching reforms. In the teaching reform, the colleges of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine mainly adopted two measures: one is to establish experimental areas in pastoral areas to conduct on-site teaching, production practice, labor training, and scientific research work, so that teaching and scientific research are closely integrated with the current pastoral production to promote the development of pastoral production. The other measure is to establish farms and veterinary hospitals on a large scale, so that the heads of departments become farm managers, teachers become technicians, and students become workers, correcting the serious shortcomings of being divorced from reality in teaching work.

On the basis of emancipating the mind and breaking down superstitions, universities and colleges have enthusiastically carried out scientific research. In the field of humanities, there are the research on Mongolian consonants and vowels, the research on the Mongolian Latinization scheme, and the compilation of the "Mongolian-Chinese phonetic dictionary" by the Mongolian Language and Literature Department of Inner Mongolia University, and the compilation of more than ten kinds of "A Brief History of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" and "The History of Hohhot" by the History Department of Inner Mongolia University. In the field of natural sciences, there are the "Survey Report on Common Insects in Xilin Gol League Pastoral Area" and pasture reports compiled by the Biology Department of Inner Mongolia University, and the "Flora of Wild Economic Plants of Inner Mongolia" compiled in cooperation with several schools, etc.

Yunnan, located in the frontier, rich in products, and a province of many ethnic groups, is experiencing a leap in its educational development. It has created and improved writing systems for nine ethnic groups and carried out literacy work in ethnic minority areas, and has opened ethnic schools of all levels and types.

Yunnan is famous in the world for its non-ferrous metals. Teachers and students of Kunming Institute of Technology and Kunming Geological School respectively organized geological survey teams. Young geological vanguards have traveled all over the mountains and ridges of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, crossed countless rivers and primeval forests, and under the leadership of the Party, overcame numerous difficulties and found hundreds of mineral deposits. Most of them are rare non-ferrous metals. Chen Xiwen, a 22-year-old Communist Youth League member of Kunming Geological School, broke down the superstition of "experts" and found a copper mine with considerable reserves – the Xiangyun Copper Mine – in a place where many experts believed that there were no minerals to be mined. The high-purity beryllium oxide, spectrally pure non-ferrous rare metal extracted by teachers of the Metallurgy Department of Kunming Institute of Technology, has exceeded the world level announced by the "International Atomic Energy Commission for Peaceful Uses" in Geneva in 1955.

Kunming Institute of Technology has also signed a long-term contract with Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture to jointly establish the Yao'an Lead Mine. In addition to technical cooperation, the school's classrooms have been moved to the mine site, where production, teaching, and scientific research are carried out simultaneously. They have made great achievements and have opened up broad avenues for the combination of mining and metallurgy professional education with productive labor.

    教育服务生产　实践丰富理论
    陕西：学校既办工厂又办农场
    内蒙古：学校大办牧场
    云南：课堂搬进矿山
    陕西的学校和地方联系的有三十二县，五千三百九十七个单位。交通大学（西安部分）支援延安地区建设，到8月底已建立三十四座钢铁厂、五千一百零二座土高炉，培训了三千多名技术员。武功水利学校的师生支援农业生产，苦战八个月，协助全省扩大灌溉面积五百多万亩，相当于解放前全省灌溉面积的一点四倍。西安十一所高等院校在全省农业机械化运动中，制造了大车轴承两万多套，架子车轴承三万四千多套，柴油机两万四千多部，改装水车二千九百多部。各级学校协助地方办起各类学校二十三万多所。
    人们看到全省学校的工业产品，有各式各样的钢、铁、车床、电子计算机、收音机、药剂等。全省中等以上学校已办起五千多个工厂，单是十三所高等学校工厂的产品就有三千六百多种，有一批已达到或超过国际水平。在展览会上，陈列着五花八门的农业生产成就，有用硕大的水果叠成的果塔，有粮食塔，有瓜塔……全省中等以上学校种了六万一千多亩田地，进行着各种试验。内蒙古这里所有的学校都建立牧场，饲养牲畜，仅呼盟阿尔山小学就饲养了六千多头牲畜。这些学校还建立了许多工厂，出产了像奶粉、干餎素、奶油、奶皮子、奶豆腐、羊毛、毛毡、皮革制品等畜产品和工业品。
    内蒙古高等学校大力进行了教学改革。畜牧兽医各学院在教学改革中，主要采取两项措施，一是在牧区建立试验区进行现场教学、生产实习、劳动锻炼和科学研究工作，使教学和科学研究与当前的牧业生产密切结合起来，促进牧业生产的发展。另一个措施是大办农牧场和兽医院，做到系主任当场长、教师当技术员、学生当工人，纠正了教学工作中脱离实际的严重缺点。
    在解放思想，破除迷信的基础上，各高等学校热烈地进行了科学研究工作。在人文科学方面，有内蒙古大学蒙古语言文学系关于蒙语辅音和元音的研究，蒙语拉丁化方案的研究，和编写“蒙汉文对照拼音词典”，有内蒙古大学历史系编写的“内蒙古自治区简史”、“呼和浩特史”等十多种。在自然科学方面，有内蒙古大学生物系编写的
  “锡盟牧区常见昆虫调查报告”、牧草报告、及同几个学校合作编写的“内蒙古野生经济植物志”等。云　南地处边疆、物产丰富、是多民族的省份，这里的教育事业正在飞跃地发展，已经为九个民族创造和改进了文字，并进行了民族地区的扫盲工作，开办了各级各类民族学校。
    云南是以有色金属著称于世界的。昆明工学院和昆明地质学校师生分别组织了地质普查队。年青的地质尖兵，踏遍了云贵高原的崇山峻岭，渡过了无数河流和原始森林，在党的领导下克服重重困难找到了数百个矿点。其中大部分是稀有的有色金属。昆明地质学校二十二岁的学生共青团员陈锡文破除了对“专家”的迷信，在不少专家认为无矿可采的地方找到了储量相当大的铜矿——祥云大铜矿。昆明工学院冶金系教师提制的有色稀有金属高纯度氧化铍光谱纯度已超过日内瓦“国际和平利用原子能委员会”1955年公布的世界水平。
    昆明工学院还和楚雄彝族自治州签定长期合同，协作建立了姚安铅矿。双方除了进行技术合作以外，学校的课堂搬到了矿山的现场，在矿山边生产、边教学、边进行科学研究。他们已经取得了较大成绩，为采矿、冶金专业教育与生产劳动相结合开辟了宽广的道路。
