Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th: Shanxi Province has achieved a large-scale increase in corn production this year, realizing the goal of becoming a "Corn Thousand-Jin Province."

　　The province planted over 5,871,000 mu of corn this year. According to actual yields and estimates from various regions, the total output could reach 6,138,760,000 jin, with an average yield of over 1,045 jin per mu, nearly three times higher than the historical peak unit yield of corn in 1954. In Changzhi, Yuci, Jinan, and other regions with larger corn planting areas, the average yield per mu is between 1,000 and 1,200 jin. Preliminary statistics from Jinan and Changzhi prefectures alone show that the unit yield of corn has reached over 10,000 jin on 175 mu. Zhang Shengcai, the Party Branch Secretary of Qinglin Agricultural Planting Farm in Zhaocheng People's Commune, Hongzhao County, and others cultivated 1.1 mu of corn after the previous crop, with an average yield of 30,648.5 jin per mu, the largest high-yield corn "satellite" in Shanxi Province to date.

　　Since the beginning of this year, in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, people in various parts of Shanxi Province have debated and criticized the idea that "corn yields are low." At the same time, they have learned from the lessons of last year's corn yield reduction and have closely grasped various measures such as deep plowing, close planting, watering, and fertilization. Farmers in various regions have also launched an "using Summer to promote Autumn" campaign based on the experience of high wheat yields, and have generally carried out multiple topdressings, watering, hoeing, weeding, and artificial pollination in the later stages of corn growth, ensuring sufficient water and fertilizer, and guaranteeing a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 7th: Sichuan Province has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of 32,355,600 mu of mid-season rice. According to statistics from the agricultural department on the 3rd, the total output of mid-season rice in the province reached 23,316,000,000 jin, a net increase of over 6.9 billion jin compared to last year. The average yield per mu was 720.6 jin, an increase of approximately half compared to last year's 505 jin.

　　This year in Sichuan Province, from the plains to the mountains, most of the main mid-season rice producing areas have yields of over 600 jin per mu, and there is one prefecture with yields of over 1,000 jin, and sixteen high-yield counties with yields of over 1,000 jin. Pi County alone has released 35 high-yield "satellite" fields with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu. In the western Sichuan plain, Wenjiang Prefecture has an average yield of over 1,200 jin per mu, more than double that of last year.

　　The bumper harvest of mid-season rice in Sichuan Province is the fruitful result of the people of the entire province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, transforming nature and transforming their thinking. During the growth period of mid-season rice, the province organized two large-scale production inspections with millions of cadres at the five levels meeting in the fields. Coupled with regular evaluations, inspections, and competitions in various regions, everything was debated, forming a nationwide production upsurge. In this situation, technical measures such as close planting and increased fertilization were well implemented. In Mabian County, a mountainous area where ethnic minorities live, due to breaking the idea that "there is no way in the mountains" and actively improving measures, especially by focusing on deep plowing, the county's average yield this year exceeded 1,000 jin per mu, more than three times higher than last year. Because of the experience gained from the bumper harvests of wheat and early rice, various regions have continuously adopted small-scale campaigns to repeatedly eliminate third-class seedlings and promote new leaps forward. Wenjiang Prefecture grasped this point, raising the standard of first-class seedlings in the entire region from several hundred jin to over one thousand jin, thereby greatly breaking through the original production plan.

　　In the past few months, Sichuan farmers have also overcome various natural disasters that have plagued mid-season rice and have produced large quantities of indigenous pesticides, conducting tireless struggles against pests and diseases.

### 玉米千斤省——山西  四川三千万亩中稻大丰收

    玉米千斤省——山西
    四川三千万亩中稻大丰收
    新华社太原9日电　山西省今年玉米获得大面积增产，实现了玉米千斤省。
    今年全省共种植玉米五百八十七万一千多亩，根据各地的实收和估产，总产量可达六十一亿三千八百七十六万斤，平均亩产可达一千零四十五斤多，比历史上玉米单位产量最高的1954年增产将近三倍。种植玉米较多的长治、榆次、晋南等地区每亩平均产量都在一千斤到一千二百斤。其中仅据晋南、长治两个专区的初步统计，已有一百七十五亩玉米单位产量达到了一万斤以上。洪赵县赵城人民公社青林农业种植场党支部书记张生才等培植的一亩一分回茬玉米，每亩平均产量达到三万零六百四十八斤半，是山西省目前最大的玉米高产“卫星”。
    今年以来，山西省各地人民在农业生产大跃进中，经过辩论，批判了“玉米低产”论的思想，同时吸取了去年玉米减产的教训，紧紧抓住了深耕、密植、浇水、施肥等各种措施。各地农民还根据小麦丰产的经验，展开了“以夏促秋”运动，在玉米生长的后期普遍进行了多次追肥、浇水、中耕锄草和人工授粉等后期加工管理，做到了水饱肥足，保证了丰收。
    新华社成都7日电　四川省三千二百三十五万六千亩中稻获得大面积丰收。据农业部门3日统计，全省中稻总产量共达二百三十三亿一千六百万斤，比去年净增六十九亿多斤，平均亩产七百二十点六斤，比去年的五百零五斤提高约半倍。
    今年四川省从平原到山区，绝大部分中稻主产区亩产都在六百斤以上，并且出现了千斤以上的专区一个，千斤以上的高产县共十六个。郫县一县放出了亩产万斤以上高产“卫星”田三十五处。川西平原上温江专区平均亩产一千二百多斤，比去年提高了一倍多。
    四川省中稻大丰收是全省人民在各级党委领导下改造自然，也改造思想取得的丰硕之果。在中稻生长期间，全省曾组织两次几百万五级干部田间会师的生产大检查，加上各地经常性的评比检查和竞赛，一切通过辩论，形成了一个全民不断跃进的生产高潮。在这一形势下，各地密植、增施肥料等技术措施贯彻得很好。民族杂居的高山区马边县，由于破除了“山区没办法”的论调，积极改进措施，特别是抓紧深耕，全县今年平均亩产超过一千斤，比去年提高了三倍还多。由于接受了小麦、早稻丰产经验，各地不断采取小运动方式反复消灭三类苗，促进新的跃进。温江专区就是抓住了这一条，使全区一类苗的标准从几百斤最后提高到一千几百斤，从而大大突破了原订生产计划。
    四川省农民在过去几个月中，还战胜了侵袭中稻的各种自然灾害，并大量制造土农药，向病虫害进行了不懈的斗争。
