The sound of rice hulling in the village

Ji Kang

Every morning before the sun comes out, the Dai village booms with sounds: the chorus of cockcrows, the birdsong among the branches and leaves, the clear sound of cowbells heading to the fields, and the sound of leather drums from the Buddhist temple... Among the many sounds, the most prominent is the dull, rumbling sound of the rice hulling ram.

This is the sound that Dai women make with their footboards for more than three hundred days a year.

It rings out from under every family's bamboo house. From the direction of the sound, one can guess that it is the sound of Yi Jinna and her sister-in-law husking rice, because there are two of them, so the sound is tight and powerful; listening to the sound of the stone mortar next door, it is much slower, that is the sound of the lonely old woman Mi Dewan husking rice. Obviously, her legs can't compete with the wooden bar on the stone mortar, and the slow sound seems to let you see an old person. In the middle of these fast and slow sounds, there are dozens of sounds ringing out at the same time, those are from Mi Yangguang's family, Yi Xiangnen's family, Han Rongwen's family, and the lame woman Yi Xiangnan's family... They are all treading on the stone mortar in the same morning light, and every day they greet the dawn with the "dong—dong—" sound of rice hulling.

This sound remains in every past morning, only on the "Long Day" which comes every five days, it is forbidden by ancient customs. Women can have one morning out of five days not husking rice, and the stone mortar is also respected by its owner on the "Long Day". On this day, it rests with the women.

The need for this situation to change was reminded to people by the great leap forward in agricultural production, because women came out of their homes and went to the fields, they shouldered more things and more valuable labor. For example, picking tea, the old woman Mi Dewan can pick fifteen kilograms of fresh leaves in a morning, while husking rice can only husk a quarter of a basket, which kind of labor is more beneficial?

At this time, the Provincial Party Committee put forward measures for rural agricultural mechanization, and the Prefectural Party Committee held an exhibition of agricultural technology reform. Ingenious and enthusiastic woodworking workers found ways to improve the stone mortar for husking rice. There were those pulled by livestock, and those powered by water and wind. Various wooden machines were published in newspapers, and people who went to the interior brought back the drawings and dimensions. It is said that some villages have already done this. This concerns the affairs of many women, and it concerns getting rid of the heavy stone mortar on their feet, which makes everyone very excited. Many women are doing their best to urge the commune cadres and the elders of the village to bring back this treasure for everyone with travel expenses.

Bo Yan took a trip to the interior and came back with drawings and models. The old people gathered together to study the style, and the women took out wooden boards from their homes. In less than ten days, three water mill houses were built next to the ditch behind the village...

Now, in the mornings of the Dai village, the dull sound of the stone mortar is gone. The laughter of the women, accompanied by the clear sound of cowbells, echoes incessantly in the fields and tea groves...

    村寨的碓声
    季康
    每天早晨太阳还没有出来以前，傣族村寨轰响着一片声音：那群声合唱的鸡鸣，那枝头叶间的鸟语，那走向田间的清脆的牛铃声，还有那佛寺里传出来的皮鼓声响，……在很多声响里最突出的还要算那沉闷的、轰隆振响的碓声。
    这是傣族妇女每年三百多天都要用脚板踩踏出来的声音。
    它从每家的竹楼下面响起来，从声音的方位可以猜测到这是依金娜和她大嫂舂米的碓声，因为她们是两个人，所以声音紧促而有力；再听隔壁石碓的响声却缓慢的多了，那是孤老婆子咪的婉在舂米。显然她的脚杆敌不过石碓上的木杠，迟缓的响声好像让你看见了一个年老的人。在这一快一慢不同的碓声中间，同时还轰响着远远近近的数十种声响，那些是咪岩光家的、依香嫩家的、罕荣温家的、还有拐脚女人依香囡家的，……她们都在这同一的晨光里踏动着石碓，每天都是以“咚——咚——”的碓声迎接着黎明。
    这声音留在过去的每个早晨里，只有在五天一个的“龙日”它才被古老的习俗所禁忌，妇女可以在五天中有一个早晨不舂米，石碓也在“龙日”才为它的主人所敬重。这天它和妇女一同休息。
    这情况的需要改变，是农业生产大跃进把人们提醒的，因为妇女从家里走出来，到了田间，她们担负了更多的事、更有价值的劳动。比如采茶吧，咪的婉老婆子一个早晨能采摘十五公斤鲜叶，而舂米却只能舂一箩筐的四分之一，哪一样劳动更有益处呢？
    就在这时候，省委提出了农村土机械化的措施，地委举办了一个农业技术改革的展览会。精巧而热心的木器工人找到了改良石碓舂米的办法，有用牲口拉的，有用水力和风力的，各种各样的木机器在报纸上登出来了，去内地参观的人把图样和尺寸带回来了，听说有的寨子早已这样做了。这关系着许许多多妇女的事，关系着甩掉脚上那只沉重的石碓的事，使大家都很兴奋，许多妇女都竭力怂恿着社干部和寨上的老年人，带上路费把这个宝给大家取回来。
    波岩叫到内地去了一趟，带着图样和模型回来了。老人们聚在一起研究了一下样式，妇女们从各家拿出木板来，不到十天就在寨子后面的水沟旁边，修起了三座水碾房。……
    如今，傣族村寨的早晨，过去那种沉闷的石碓声没有了。妇女们的欢笑声，伴同着清脆的牛铃声，在田间和茶林中不住地回荡……
