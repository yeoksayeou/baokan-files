Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 14th - "Al-Nasr" newspaper reported today that Lebanese Prime Minister Karami said that the Lebanese government will "continue to punish those who create riots, and even eliminate them." He said that his government will take strict measures to stop Chamoun's activities.

Karami said that within this week, he will call on all Lebanese people to hand over their weapons to the security forces. He will use troops to complete this task.

When a reporter asked him if he would dissolve political parties, he said, "Taking this action is very likely." When talking about the future of the current parliament, he said that his government will have the privilege of enacting laws without the parliament's approval. He said that the government is discussing the future of the current parliament.

According to today's "Al Anwar" newspaper, Chamoun's elements and the thugs of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party continued shooting people in Beirut all day yesterday, attempting to force residents to strike and shut down businesses, but their attempts were not realized, because all the people were determined to restore the situation to normal. It is reported that Chamoun's elements and the thugs of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party are continuing to set fire to shops, factories, and houses, while they are also massacring innocent people in Beirut and Tripoli, as part of the imperialists' plot to create excuses for the U.S. occupation forces to delay their withdrawal.

According to today's "Al-Jamahir" newspaper, Chamoun announced yesterday that he is prepared to go to Beirut on October 20th to intensify his activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 14th - Lebanese Progressive Socialist Party leader Jumblatt suggested forming a military cabinet composed of opposition leaders from the era of former President Chamoun, and arresting imperialist agents Chamoun and eradicating subversives, in order to end the Lebanese crisis.

Jumblatt also said in a statement issued to the Syrian News Agency on the 13th that "the presence of American troops in Lebanon is considered the primary factor encouraging Chamoun to carry out conspiracies."

He said that President Chehab is now handling the crisis through political means. Jumblatt believes that force and determination are needed to deal with the current crisis. He said that the way to end the artificial crisis is to form a military cabinet and try the spies. He advocated that Prime Minister Karami should not ask the parliament to hold a vote of confidence before the American troops have completely withdrawn.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 13th - According to today's "Al Anwar" newspaper, due to the deliberate obstruction of imperialist agents such as Chamoun's elements and Phalangists and Syrian Social Nationalist Party members, the recent contacts between Lebanese politicians have not been able to achieve any fair resolution of the current crisis in Lebanon.

The "Al Anwar" correspondent in Beirut said that there are currently three suggestions brewing: First, maintain the current cabinet that is supported by the masses; second, form a military government with Karami as prime minister; and third, reorganize the current cabinet.

The reporter said that the proposal to bring Syrian Social Nationalist Party member Ghassan Tueni into the cabinet has aroused unparalleled indignation among the masses, and this proposal has not been discussed at all. According to "Al Anwar", a Lebanese Christian delegation visited Karami, expressed its support for him, and protested against the proposal to let Tueni enter the cabinet. Karami said to the delegation: "The imperialist agents say that Lebanese Muslims oppose Lebanese independence and hope to join some other Arab countries, which is completely untrue." He pointed out that it is certain that those enemies of Lebanese independence demand foreign occupation and pursue a hostile policy towards Arab countries.

The representatives also told Karami that they refused to accept certain Phalangist members into the cabinet. In reply, Karami assured the representatives that he would act in accordance with the interests of Lebanon.

According to today's "Al Anwar", members of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party attacked the residence of National Front member Majdalani last night. Government troops were dispatched to suppress the attack, resulting in one Syrian Social Nationalist Party member being killed and the others fleeing.

A special correspondent for "Al-Youm" newspaper said last night that Chamoun's elements from the Tueni family in the village of Zgharta near Tripoli carried out rampant provocations on the morning of the 12th, killing eight innocent pedestrians heading to Tripoli. Soon, the patriotic forces arrived at the scene and fought with Chamoun's elements, resulting in seven Chamoun's elements being killed. The military authorities in Tripoli took emergency measures, imposed a curfew, and declared a state of emergency.

    美国继续在黎巴嫩捣鬼
    卡拉米表示严厉镇压骚乱
    琼卜拉特主张逮捕帝国主义代理人
    新华社大马士革14日电　“胜利报”今天报道，黎巴嫩总理卡拉米说，黎巴嫩政府将“继续给予那些制造骚乱的人们惩罚，甚至消灭他们。”他说，他的政府将采取严厉措施来制止夏蒙的活动。
    卡拉米说，在本星期内，他将号召所有黎巴嫩人把武器交给保安部队。他将使用部队来完成这个任务。
    有记者问他是否将解散政党，他说，“采取这一行动是很可能的”。他在谈到关于本届议会前途时说，他的政府将拥有可以使内阁不通过议会而颁布法律的特权。他说，政府正在讨论本届议会的前途问题。
    据今天的“光明报”报道，夏蒙分子和国家社会党匪徒昨天一整天继续在贝鲁特开枪打人，企图迫使居民罢工停业，但是他们的企图没有实现，因为全体人民都坚决要使局势恢复正常。据悉，夏蒙分子和国家社会党匪徒正在继续放火焚烧商店、工厂和住房，同时他们还在屠杀贝鲁特和的黎波里的无辜人民，作为帝国主义制造借口以使美国占领军拖延撤兵阴谋的一部分。
    据今天的“群众报”报道，夏蒙昨天宣布，他准备在10月20日到贝鲁特去加紧进行活动。
    新华社大马士革14日电　黎巴嫩社会进步党领袖琼卜拉特建议成立由前总统夏蒙任职期间的反对派领袖组成的军事内阁，并且逮捕帝国主义代理人夏蒙和根除颠复分子，以结束黎巴嫩的危机。
    琼卜拉特在13日向叙利亚通讯社发表的声明还说，“美国军队驻在黎巴嫩被认为是鼓励夏蒙进行阴谋活动的首要因素”。
    他说，谢哈布总统现在是通过政治手段来处理危机。琼卜拉特认为，需要使用武力和决心来处理目前的危机。他说，结束人为危机的办法就是成立军事内阁和审判特务。他主张，卡拉米总理在美军没有完全撤离以前不应该要求议会举行信任投票。
    据新华社大马士革13日电　据“光明报”今天报道，由于夏蒙分子和长枪党以及国家社会党的党徒等帝国主义代理人的蓄意阻挠，黎巴嫩政治家最近的接触并没有能使黎巴嫩目前的危机获得任何公正的解决。
    “光明报”驻贝鲁特特派记者说，目前在酝酿三个建议：第一、维持得到人民群众支持的现内阁；二、成立由卡拉米担任总理的军政府；三、改组现内阁。
    记者说，关于把国家社会党议员加桑·特韦尼塞进内阁的主张在群众中间引起了无比的愤慨，这个主张根本没有加以讨论。据“光明报”说，黎巴嫩基督教代表团访问了卡拉米，表示支持他，并且抗议让特韦尼进入内阁的主张。卡拉米对代表团说：“帝国主义代理人说，黎巴嫩穆斯林反对黎巴嫩独立并且希望加入其他某些阿拉伯国家，这是完全不真实的。”他指出，可以肯定，那些黎巴嫩的独立的敌人要求外国占领，并且对阿拉伯国家奉行敌对政策。
    代表们还对卡拉米说，他们拒绝接纳某些长枪党党徒进入内阁。卡拉米在答复中向代表们保证根据黎巴嫩的利益办事。
    据“光明报”今天说，国家社会党党员昨晚袭击民族阵线成员马吉达兰尼的住宅，政府军出动镇压，结果有一个国家社会党人被击毙，其他的人逃逸。
    “今天报”特派记者昨晚说，的黎波里附近扎加尔塔村特韦尼家族的夏蒙分子12日清晨进行了猖狂的挑衅，击毙了前往的黎波里的八个无辜的行人。不久，爱国力量部队赶到出事地点，同夏蒙分子进行战斗，结果有七个夏蒙分子被击毙。军事当局在的黎波里采取了紧急措施，实行戒严，并且宣布处于紧急状态。
