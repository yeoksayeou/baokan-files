　　The latecomer surpasses the old-timer since ancient times. In terms of economic construction, Qinghai Province can be called a latecomer. We, this latecomer, must surpass the old-timer. Under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, as long as we fully unleash the revolutionary drive of communism, fully exploit all favorable factors, and overcome unfavorable factors, we will definitely be able to surpass the old-timer.

　　Our Party has led the people of Qinghai in nearly nine years of construction and achieved great successes. The current Qinghai is completely different from the Qinghai under the rule of the bandit Ma Bufang. However, due to historical reasons, Qinghai is still much more backward than other regions in terms of economy and culture. The main signs of backwardness are: underdeveloped industry, with industrial production materials and living materials basically relying on foreign aid; underdeveloped science and culture, with only two universities with a small number of students in the entire province; and the people's material and cultural life is not yet affluent.

　　However, things are always changing. The development of many things will move towards their opposite. Qinghai will go from backward to advanced, and the current backwardness is only a temporary phenomenon. Today, Qinghai is behind other regions, but it may soon catch up with or even surpass other regions. According to our initial vision, by 1962, the industrial output value of our province will be ninety times that of 1957, the grain output in agriculture will be more than twelve times that of 1957, and the industrial output value will account for more than 66% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. This is the main sign of the latecomer surpassing the old-timer.

　　So, what will Qinghai look like five years from now? By then, several industrial bases will be established throughout the province, initially forming an industrial system. Truly, "machines are humming everywhere, and factories are all over urban and rural areas." The countryside will become a veritable socialist new countryside, with each cooperative having its own factories, schools, and hospitals, and agricultural mechanization and rural electrification will have been achieved. The face of the pastoral areas will be fundamentally changed, and the masses of herdsmen will be forever freed from feudal oppression and enter a socialist paradise. Modern factories will appear on the grasslands, and the working class of minority nationalities will rapidly grow. The number of universities in the province will not be the current two, but several. Every township in the agricultural area will have a middle school, and every county in the pastoral area will have a middle school. Health care will be greatly developed. Workers, peasants, herdsmen, and other laborers will all live a much more affluent life than they do now, with abundant food and clothing, and everyone will become a cultured laborer.

　　Perhaps some people don't believe what I say. However, the development of things often exceeds people's imagination. Isn't the facts of the past few years a good proof? Qinghai five years from now will only be more advanced than we imagine, and will never be less than our current imagination. What is the basis for this?

　　First, our province has a vast territory and abundant resources. On the 820,000 square kilometers of land, there are vast treasures hidden. After only four years of exploration, more than eighty kinds of metal and non-metal minerals, including petroleum, salt, iron, lead, zinc, and borax, have been discovered, with more than 1,100 mineral deposits. There are also more than 30 million mu of arable wasteland and more than 800 million mu of grassland, and the prospects for agricultural and pastoral development are extremely broad. Water resources are particularly abundant, with twelve large and medium-sized rivers such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in the province, with hydropower reserves of approximately 20 million kilowatts. These are all the material foundations for large-scale construction, which are not available in many regions, and can be described as "uniquely blessed."

　　Second, under the premise of self-reliance, the state and fraternal provinces will give us strong support. To carry out large-scale industrial construction, our province is indeed unable to cope with the financial resources and equipment, etc. However, with the growing strength of the national construction forces, and under the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation of "one for all, all for one," this problem can be solved. In particular, the state's construction layout will fully take care of backward areas inhabited by minority nationalities, which is a guarantee for the high-speed development of our province.

　　Third, and most decisively, the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in our province for construction is growing. The people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai, who have lived in poverty for a long time, are hardworking and brave, and under the leadership of the Party, they are determined to change their backwardness as soon as possible. This can be most powerfully proven by the miracles created in water conservancy construction this spring.

　　With the wise leadership of the Party and such good conditions, what reason do we have not to quickly transform from a backward to an advanced place?

　　Of course, there are still some difficulties. For example, our province's economic foundation is weak, the labor force is insufficient, and the technical strength is weak, and so on. However, these are not insurmountable difficulties.

　　The same problem will lead to different conclusions when observed from different viewpoints. Starting from the viewpoint of dialectical materialism and comprehensively analyzing the above-mentioned conditions, the conclusion drawn is that Qinghai's construction prospects are bright and very optimistic. Starting from the bourgeois metaphysical viewpoint, the conclusion drawn is "pessimism." Its arguments are fivefold: first, "backwardness theory"; second, "condition theory"; third, "population theory"; fourth, "small province theory"; and fifth, "foundation theory."

　　Such superstitions and inferiority complexes are indeed harmful, putting many golden hoops on ourselves, stifling people's subjective initiative, making us afraid to think about what we should think, afraid to say what we dare to say, and afraid to do what we should do.

　　The reason for the above-mentioned superstitions and inferiority complexes: ideologically speaking, it is mainly a reflection of the wavering nature of the petty bourgeoisie, focusing on personal gains and losses in the revolutionary cause, and lacking a firm revolutionary will and a fearless revolutionary courage. From the perspective of ideology and methodology, it is a reflection of subjectivism in construction issues, disbelieving in the power of the masses, not understanding that all things are a unity of opposites, not recognizing the whole picture of things, and seeing only the trees but not the forest.

　　To enable the latecomer to surpass the old-timer, everyone must establish the idea of surpassing the old-timer, and everyone must establish the idea of striving for progress. As long as everyone in the province establishes this idea, our Qinghai will definitely leap from a latecomer to surpass the old-timer. This is the first idea to be established.

　　The second idea to be established is self-reliance. Qinghai's construction cannot be separated from the support of the state and fraternal provinces, but it must be based on self-reliance and supplemented by seeking foreign aid. In the future, we will resolutely not ask the higher authorities or others for anything that we can do ourselves. The province treats the state in this way, the county treats the province in this way, and the township treats the county in the same way.

　　The third idea to be established is the idea of diligence and frugality in running all undertakings. Hard struggle has always been our Party's combat slogan, and even if the face of Qinghai changes fundamentally in five years, we cannot abandon this slogan.

　　After solving these ideological understanding problems, the important issue lies in action, in doing things in a down-to-earth manner. Our Communists differ from all utopians in that they not only dare to propose far-reaching ideals, but also resolutely fight to realize these ideals.

　　Chairman Mao said, "In addition to other characteristics, the most prominent feature of China's 600 million people is poverty and blankness. These seem like bad things, but they are actually good things. Poverty leads to change, to doing things, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without any burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and good for painting the newest and most beautiful pictures." Let us use our own hands to work hard on the land of Qinghai! Let us write the newest and most beautiful words and paint the newest and most beautiful pictures on this blank sheet of paper in Qinghai!

### 后来者居上

    后来者居上
    中共青海省委书记处书记　张国声
    自古以来就是后来者居上。以经济建设来说，青海省可称为后来者。我们这个后来者要居上。在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，只要充分发挥共产主义的革命干劲，充分发挥一切有利因素，克服不利因素，一定能够居上。
    我们党领导青海人民进行了近九年的建设，取得了伟大的成绩，如今的青海与马匪步芳统治时代的青海完全是两样。然而，由于历史的原因，青海比其他地区在经济和文化方面仍然落后得多。落后的主要标志是：工业不发达，工业方面的生产资料和生活资料基本上依靠外援；科学文化事业不发达，全省只有两所人数很少的高等学校；人民的物质文化生活还不富裕。
    但是，事情总是变化的。很多事物的发展，都要走向自己的反面。青海将由落后走向先进，现在的落后只是一种暂时的现象。今天青海比其他地区落后，不久就可能赶上甚至超过其他地区。根据我们的初步设想，到1962年我省的工业产值将等于1957年的九十倍，农业方面的粮食产量将等于1957年的十二倍多，工业产值将占工农业总产值的66％以上。这就是后来者居上的主要标志。
  　
    那么，五年以后的青海将变成什么样子呢？到那时，全省将建立起若干个工业基地，初步形成为一个工业体系，真是“机器到处响，工厂遍城乡”；农村将变成名副其实的社会主义新农村，每个合作社都有自己的工厂、学校和医院，农业机械化和农村电气化已经实现；牧业区的面貌将根本改变，牧民群众永远摆脱了封建压迫而走入社会主义的天堂，草原上将出现现代化的工厂，少数民族自己的工人阶级迅速成长起来；全省的高等学校将不是现在的两所，而是若干所，农业区的每个乡都有了中学，牧业区的每个县都有了中学，卫生保健事业将大大发展；工人、农民、牧民以及其他劳动者都将过着比现在富裕得多的生活，丰衣足食，人人都将成为有文化的劳动者。
    我这样说，也许有人不相信。然而，事情的发展往往是要超过人们的想像的。过去几年的事实不就是很好的证明吗？五年以后的青海只会比我们想像的更先进，决不会不及于我们现在的想像。根据何在呢？
    第一，我省地大物博，各种资源非常丰富。在八十二万平方公里的土地上，蕴藏着大量的宝藏，仅仅经过四年多的勘察，即已发现包括石油、盐、铁、铅、锌、硼砂等各种金属和非金属矿八十多种，一千一百多个矿点。还有三千多万亩可垦荒地，八亿多亩草原，农牧业发展前途极为广阔。水力资源尤为丰富，全省有黄河、长江等十二条大中河流，水电蕴藏能量约二千万瓩。这些都是大规模建设的物质基础，是许多地区所不及的，可谓“得天独厚”。
    第二，在自力更生为主的前提之下，国家和兄弟省将给我们以大力支援。要进行大规模的工业建设，我省在资金设备等方面确实力不胜任。但是，在国家建设力量日益强大的情况下，在“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义大协作的精神下，这个问题是可以获得解决的。特别是在国家建设布局上将充分照顾少数民族落后地区，更是我省高速度发展的一个保证。
    第三，最有决定意义的是，我省各族人民的建设积极性日益高涨。长期过着贫困生活的青海各族人民，勤劳勇敢，在党的领导下，决心尽快地改变落后面貌。这从今年春季兴修水利所创造的奇迹中，可以得到最为有力的证明。
    有党的英明领导，有这样好的条件，我们有什么理由不很快地由落后者变为先进者呢？
    当然，也还存在着若干困难。例如：我省的经济基础薄弱，劳动力不足，技术力量弱，等等。但是，这些都不是不可克服的困难。
    同样的问题，用不同的观点观察，就得出不同的结论。从辩证唯物主义的观点出发，综合分析上述各种条件之后，得出的结论是青海的建设前途一片光明，非常乐观。从资产阶级的形而上学的观点出发，得出的是“悲观论”。其论据有五：一曰“落后论”，二曰“条件论”，三曰“人口论”，四曰“小省论”，五曰“基础论”。
    这种种迷信和自卑，害人确实不浅，它给我们自己戴上了许多金箍咒，扼制了人们的主观能动作用，使我们该想的事情不敢想，敢说的话不敢说，该干的事情不敢干。
    上述种种迷信和自卑感，究其原因：从思想意识上说，主要地是小资产阶级动摇性的反映，对革命事业计较个人得失，缺乏坚定的革命意志和大无畏的革命胆略。从思想方法上说，是主观主义在建设问题上的反映，不相信群众的力量，不懂得一切事物都是对立的统一，不认识事物的全貌，只见树木不见森林。
    要使后来者居上，就必须人人立居上的思想，人人立争上游的思想。只要全省人人都立上这种思想，我们青海就一定能由后来者一跃而居上。这是头一个要立的思想。
    第二个要立的思想是自力更生。青海的建设离不开国家和兄弟省的支援，但是，必须自力更生为主，争取外援为辅。今后，凡是自己能办到的坚决不向上要、向别人要，省对国家如此，县对省也如此，乡对县还是如此。
    第三个要立的思想是勤俭办一切事业的思想。艰苦奋斗始终是我们党的战斗口号，即使五年后青海的面貌根本改变，也不能丢掉这个口号。
    在解决了这些思想认识问题之后，重要的问题就在于行动，就在于实实在在的去干。我们共产党人区别于一切空想家，它不仅敢于提出远大的理想，而且坚决为实现这个理想而奋斗。
    毛主席说，“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”让我们用自己的双手在青海这块土地上大干特干吧！在青海这张白纸上写出最新最美的文字，画出最新最美的画图吧！
