    Albania's coal industry sector completed its production plan for the first nine months of this year.
    Albania's coal industry has developed extremely rapidly. Compared with 1938, the current coal production is approximately sixty-four times greater. In 1938, the average coal production was 3.5 kilograms per person, while in 1957 it reached an average of over 161 kilograms per person. In terms of coal production per capita, Albania has surpassed many capitalist countries.
    The mechanization and electrification of coal mine work have played an important role in achieving these accomplishments. The degree of mechanization in some coal mines has reached 70%. Albanian geological staff will soon begin exploring a new coal deposit. By 1960, coal production is expected to increase eighty-fold compared to pre-war levels.

    每人平均得煤161公斤
    阿煤产量比1938年增64倍
    阿尔巴尼亚煤炭工业部门完成了今年头九个月的生产计划。
    阿尔巴尼亚煤炭工业的发展极为迅速。同1938年比较，现在的煤产量为那时的六十四倍左右。1938年煤产量平均每人得三点五公斤，而1957年达到平均每人一百六十一公斤以上。煤产量以人口计，阿尔巴尼亚超过了许多资本主义国家。
    煤矿工作的机械化和电气化，对取得这些成就起了重要的作用。有些煤矿的机械化程度已达到70％。阿尔巴尼亚的地质工作人员不久将着手勘查一个新的煤炭蕴藏地。到1960年煤产量预计将比战前增加八十倍。
