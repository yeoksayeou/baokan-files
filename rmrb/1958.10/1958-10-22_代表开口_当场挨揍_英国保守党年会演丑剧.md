    Representative Speaks Up, Gets Beaten On the Spot
    Spectacle at the British Conservative Party Conference

    (Reported by this newspaper) The British Conservative Party held its annual conference in Blackpool. Naturally, a conference like this is extremely important on the eve of an election. Conservative newspapers have recently been touting the Conservative Party's "achievements," portraying every cabinet figure as a "hero," with Macmillan, of course, being the "hero of heroes."

    Similarly, the Conservative Party put in a lot of effort to make this conference a success. From the beginning to the third day, the conference proceeded smoothly. As usual, the ministers were all welcomed as "heroes." Foreign Secretary Lloyd "contributed" to the invasion of the Middle East; Labour Minister Macleod "contributed" to "suppressing workers' wages"; Finance Minister Amory had just returned from the economic conferences in Canada and Delhi and "contributed."

    On the fourth day of the conference, it was the turn of the great "heroic figure" Macmillan to appear. This was undoubtedly the climax of the conference. Before the conference, the venue was searched to prevent suspicious people from entering, and even five minutes before the start of the conference, plainclothes police searched every room next to the conference hall. The police also checked the entry pass of a person coming out of the toilet. The delegates attending the conference were undoubtedly carefully selected.

    Macmillan appeared. A burst of applause.

    Macmillan gave his speech with great satisfaction. As he was speaking with relish, a delegate stood up and said: "Unemployment is going to increase, if we..." Before he could finish speaking, several delegates around him had pinned him to the ground and gagged his mouth. In an instant, this delegate was carried out of the conference hall and locked in a small room. When he came out of this small room, his face was covered in blood, his face was swollen, and his nose was bruised.

    A poem bears witness:

    Applause like thunder fills the hall,
    The Prime Minister smiles as he speaks;
    Who dares to be so tactless to speak out of turn,
    Let him have a swollen face and a bruised nose. (Attached picture)

    This delegate who wanted to question Macmillan was gagged and quickly "escorted" out of the venue.

### 代表开口　当场挨揍  英国保守党年会演丑剧

    代表开口　当场挨揍
    英国保守党年会演丑剧
    本报讯  英国保守党在布莱克浦举行了它的年会。当然这样一个在大选前夕的会议是十分重要的。保守党的报纸最近以来就一直在吹捧着保守党的“政绩”，把保守党的内阁人物，个个都打扮成“英雄”，麦克米伦当然是“英雄中的英雄”。
    同样为了把这样一个会议开好，保守党也是颇费了一番苦心的。会议从一开始到第三天一直都是很顺利地进行着。大臣们照例个个都受到“英雄”式的欢迎。外交大臣劳埃德进兵中东“有功”；劳工大臣麦克劳德“压低工人工资”“有功”；财政大臣埃默里刚从加拿大和德里的经济会议回来，“有功”。
    会议的第四天轮到了这位大“英雄人物”麦克米伦出场了。这无疑是会议的最高潮。在会前，会场被搜查了一番，以免有可疑的人进来，甚至在会议开始前五分钟，便衣警察还搜索了会议大厅旁边的各个房间。警察还检查了从厕所内出来的一个人的入场证。参加会议的代表无疑都是经过精选的。
    麦克米伦出场了。一阵掌声。
    麦克米伦洋洋得意地发表他的演说了。当他正讲得津津有味的时候，一个代表站立起来说：“失业将要增加，假如我们……”话犹未了，左右的几位代表已把他捺在地上，把他的嘴给堵起来了。一煞那间，这位代表被抬出了会场，关进一个小房间。当他从这个小房间出来之后，已是满脸鲜血，脸肿鼻青。
    有诗为证：
    掌声如雷震大厅，
    首相演说笑盈盈；
    谁不识趣乱开口，
    让他脸肿鼻子青。（附图片）
    这个想责问麦克米伦的代表被堵住了嘴，并且迅速被“护送”出会场。
