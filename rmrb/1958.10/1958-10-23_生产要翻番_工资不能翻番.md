Production Must Double, Wages Cannot Double
    Zhou Pinqing, Worker at Tianjin Jinan Tannery

    Our factory implements a piece-rate wage system. In the past, because many people were still immersed in bourgeois individualism, with money taking the lead in people's minds, it did play a stimulating role in our factory's production. However, at that time, this system also had some negative effects. A saying once prevailed in our factory: "Round or not, sixty cents." This meant that, in order to earn more money, workers only pursued quantity and disregarded quality when making balls, causing losses to the state.

    Since the nationwide rectification campaign, the communist spirit of the vast masses of workers in our factory has soared, and their ideological awareness has significantly improved. In production, they have fully demonstrated a brand-new communist labor attitude, working hard day and night without regard for compensation. For example, when the production tasks were tight in September, the workers voluntarily proposed: In order to welcome "October 1st," all factory employees should engage in voluntary labor. As a result, September's production doubled. However, our wages also doubled along with the production, which was very incompatible with the situation of the great leap forward in production and the ideological great leap forward of the workers. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, all factory employees unanimously requested the abolition of the piece-rate wage system.

    Everyone realized that, in addition to fostering economism, implementing piece-rate wages is of no benefit to production and the improvement of individual thinking. Now, the driving force for promoting production is no longer piece-rate wages, but communist ideology.

    生产要翻番　工资不能翻番
    天津市津南制革厂工人  周品清
    我厂是实行计件工资制的。过去，因为有不少人还沉醉在资产阶级个人主义思想里，钞票在人们的思想上挂了帅，所以它对我们厂的生产还起了一些刺激作用。但是，在那时，这种制度也起了一些不好的作用。我们厂里曾经流行过一句话：“圆不圆，六毛钱。”这就是说，为了多拿钱，在制球时，只顾追求产量，不顾质量，给国家造成损失。
    自从全民整风以来，我厂广大工人群众的共产主义精神高涨，思想觉悟显著提高，在生产上就完全表现出了一种崭新的共产主义劳动态度，不计报酬，日夜苦战。如9月份生产任务紧张的时候，工人们就主动提出：为了迎接“十·一”，全厂职工投入义务劳动。这样一来，9月份的生产就翻了一番。可是我们的工资也随着生产翻起番来了，这与生产大跃进和工人们思想大跃进的形势太不相称了。于是全厂职工在本月15日一致要求取消计件工资制。
    大家认识到，实行计件工资除了助长经济主义外，对于生产和个人的思想提高，是一无好处的。现在促进生产的动力已不是计件工资，而是共产主义思想。
