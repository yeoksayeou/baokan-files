Abandon the Capitalist Road and Take the Socialist Road
Feng Lanzhou, Director of the Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences

With a heavy heart, I examine my bourgeois individualism and my bourgeois academic thoughts. I now realize that in the nine years since the founding of the country, despite the Party and the people's multi-faceted education and patient waiting, I have stubbornly clung to the capitalist path and remained a big white flag. I feel ashamed and fearful because I am on the verge of being abandoned by the people. However, I also recognize that the Party and the people are still educating and transforming me, striving for me. Therefore, I am determined to examine and correct my mistakes, abandon the capitalist road, take the socialist road, and serve the people.

My Bourgeois Academic Thoughts

For the past thirty years, I have been engaged in research and teaching. After liberation, comrades have repeatedly criticized me, saying that I was doing scientific research for personal fame and gain. But I never dared to admit it, because I couldn't let go of my airs and felt it would be shameful to admit it. I either ignored these opinions or verbally acknowledged them while secretly finding reasons to justify myself. When people said I was doing science for science's sake and research for research's sake, I would say that some aspects were related to practice; if it was completely unrelated to practice, I would say it was necessary for improving theory. In reality, I did research to publish articles and become famous. Rare and unpopular topics were my targets; in addition, I would research whatever came my way, as long as it could be published. In this way, the scope of research would be broad, and many papers could be published, with the hope of gaining the title of erudite and versatile, an authoritative expert in parasitology. I also used the number of published articles to measure a person's academic level. Therefore, I instilled this ideology of fame and gain into the staff I led, pointing out that anything could be researched and that one could become an expert. Under the influence of this thinking, the research of the Department of Parasitology at the Peking Union Medical College went down the capitalist road. The department did not study parasitic diseases that seriously endanger the health of our people, such as malaria, kala-azar, schistosomiasis japonica, and hookworm disease. Lecturers and teaching assistants, under my leadership, only studied protozoa parasitic in cattle, trypanosomes in camels, and worms in dogs, cattle, sheep, and even birds. I myself also studied rare human nematode filaria, human myiasis caused by cattle flies, and other practically meaningless topics. We did not study the key problems important for prevention and eradication, because these problems were difficult to research, it was not easy to get results, it was not easy to publish articles, and therefore it was not possible to become famous. As the comrades in the department pointed out, among the thirty-two research topics from 1955 to 1957, only seven were related to national tasks, and even those were only on the periphery, not aimed at solving key problems in prevention and eradication. In addition, there were some unplanned, temporarily encountered topics, such as rare human colonic ciliate protozoa, tapeworms found in human cerebrospinal fluid, etc., because these were easy to do, but this affected the completion of planned topics.

Driven by fame and gain, I was not enthusiastic about training cadres and teaching, because I thought that if they learned the skills, it would be for their own benefit and they should rely on their own efforts. The content of teaching was mostly a set of bourgeois theories, with little attention to practical aspects, and I was not enthusiastic about tutoring and internships, believing that whether they learned well or badly was their own business.

My bourgeois academic thoughts have already caused adverse consequences.

In recent years, because I was blinded by fame and gain, afraid that others would steal my name, I was unwilling to lend literature to others (such as books on Egyptian Schistosomiasis and British Diptera blood-sucking insects), and specimens were kept as private property instead of being used to train talent (such as mosquito specimens collected over many years). The research results of comrades were not encouraged or published in a timely manner (such as the study of filariasis in Shandong), thus suppressing new forces. Most hateful of all, the method of treating tapeworms with betel nuts and pumpkin seeds, which had already been researched, was not willing to be spread before it was published, regardless of the needs of the people, making myself a capitalist monopolizing science. But I still considered myself a scientific authority, arrogant and conceited, seeing only my own work for fame and gain and looking down on institutions such as the Institute of Parasitic Diseases and epidemic prevention stations, and the tremendous contributions they have made to eliminating parasitic diseases for the people. Even more hateful, when the higher authorities decided to merge the Department of Parasitology of Peking Union Medical College with the Institute of Parasitic Diseases, I still wanted to keep some people in Beijing to do "theoretical research."

Because I personally took the capitalist road, some lecturers and teaching assistants in the department were also influenced to take the bourgeois research direction, failing the task that the Party entrusted to me of training successors for socialist construction. More than that, my bourgeois academic thoughts have also influenced the broad masses of young people, and many young comrades have also advocated my path.

Last winter, when I spoke to all the comrades at the Shanghai Institute of Parasitic Diseases, I said, "We are research institutions, and epidemic prevention stations are engaged in practical prevention and treatment work." This separated research work from practical work, creating a very bad influence.

This criticism of my bourgeois academic thoughts at the National Conference on the Exchange of Experience in the Pharmaceutical and Health Technology Revolution in Beijing is not only a profound education for me, but I hope that those comrades who have learned from me will also receive a profound education.

In the past, I did not believe that the Party could lead science; I thought that the Party led politics. Specific scientific issues, such as research methods and teaching methods, had to be led by scientists. Therefore, I was dissatisfied with the Party's leadership in science, and when scientific research conflicted with my personal interests, I would pretend to comply but act differently, not accept the Party's leadership, and not act according to the Party's intentions.

The facts in recent years have proven that the Party is fully capable of leading science, and that science that serves the people can only truly develop under the leadership of the Party and by taking the socialist road. I am determined to abandon my old consciousness, establish the proletarian scientific viewpoint, and strive for science that wholeheartedly serves the people.

Determined to Transform, Pull Down the White Flag, and Plant the Red Flag

Through everyone's exposure of me and my own examination and preliminary analysis, I realize that my bourgeois thoughts and style are serious. I received a bourgeois education from an early age, especially most of my education was completed in schools set up by imperialism in our country. After graduation, I worked in Peking Union Medical College, which was run by imperialism, for more than 20 years. The cultivation of these environments has laid a solid foundation for my bourgeois academic thoughts and views. In this way, my research work went down the capitalist road of personal selfishness and self-interest. Although it has been nine years since liberation, the Party and the people have patiently educated and helped me, but I am arrogant, conceited, unwilling to let go of my airs, and unwilling to listen to others' advice, clinging to my original thoughts and unwilling to give them up. In fact, this is just a corrupt bourgeois facade. The exposure of the comrades saved me. I am determined to thoroughly correct my past mistakes. Although I now have a preliminary understanding, I hope that everyone will continue to supervise me constantly so that I can truly undergo a transformation and compensate for the losses I have caused to the Party and the people in the past with redoubled efforts. To this end, I propose the following points as my direction of effort and guarantee to implement them:

First, resolutely obey the absolute leadership of the Party, implement the Party's policies, and strive to frequently ask the Party for instructions and report to the Party on everything.

Second, fundamentally eradicate the previous ideas of scientific research for fame and gain, thoroughly break my authoritative thinking and my superstition in myself, break the superstition in foreigners, start from the 600 million people in any work, start from the task of socialist construction, humbly learn from the masses, and resolutely rely on the masses as an ordinary scientific worker.

Third, do everything through the mass line, mingle with the masses, jointly complete the tasks of the country, and often care about the masses, and regard the affairs of the masses as one's own affairs.

Fourth, humbly listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses and continue to correct one's own mistakes frequently.

Fifth, read more political theory books, such as the works of Marx, Lenin, and Chairman Mao, and arm oneself politically and ideologically.

Sixth, demand oneself in all aspects with the style of a Communist Party member, continue to pull down the white flag, plant the red flag, and leap forward together with everyone in the technical revolution.

    放弃资本主义的路，走社会主义的路
    中国医学科学院寄生虫病研究所所长　冯兰洲
    我以沉重的心情来检查我的资产阶级个人主义和我的资产阶级学术思想。我现在认识建国九年来，虽然经过党与人民多方面的教育和耐心等待，而我仍紧抱着资本主义的一套不放，我还是一面大白旗。我感到惭愧、惧怕，因为已经到了被人民抛弃的边缘。但是我也认识到党和人民还在教育改造我，争取我，因之，我决心地检查改正自己的错误，放弃资本主义的路，走社会主义的路，为人民服务。
    我的资产阶级学术思想
    过去的三十年，我都是做研究工作与教学工作。解放后，同志们曾多次对我提出批评，说我：做科学研究工作是为了个人名利。但我从来不敢承认，因为放不下架子，觉得承认了很丢人，对于这些意见，我或者是不加理睬，或是口头承认而内心里还找些理由为自己打圆场；人家说我为科学而科学、为研究而研究，我就说有些地方是联系实际的；如果完全与实际无关我就说是为提高理论所必要的。实际上我作研究为的是发表文章好出名。凡罕见的、冷门的东西，都是我选题的对象；另外，遇到什么就研究什么，只要能发表文章就行。这样，研究的范围广，发表的论文多，就有希望得到博学多能、寄生虫学专家权威的名称。我同样以发表文章的多少来衡量一个人的学术水平，因此，我对我所领导的工作人员灌输了这种为名为利的思想、指出什么都可以研究，都可以成名为专家。在我这种思想的支配下，中国协和医学院寄生物学系的研究就走上了资本主义的道路。使系内没有研究危害我国人民健康最严重的寄生虫病如疟疾、黑热病、日本血吸虫病、钩虫病等，讲师助教们在我的领导下就只是研究牛体寄生的胞子虫、骆驼锥虫，狗、牛、羊、甚至鸟的蠕虫等，我自己也研究人体罕见的美丽筒线虫、人体的牛蝇蛆病等实际上没有意义的题目。对于预防及消灭上重要的关键问题更没去研究。因为这些问题的研究是困难的，不易得出结果，不易发表文章，也就出不了名。正如系内同志们所指出的1955—1957年的三十二个研究题目中，只有七个是有关国家任务的，而且也只是沾了点边，并不是针对着解决防治与消灭上的关键问题。此外还有一些计划以外的临时遇到的题目，如罕见的人体结肠小袋纤毛虫，人脑脊髓中发现的绦虫等，因为这些容易做，但也就因此影响了计划内题目的完成。
    由于名利的驱使，我对培养干部和教学是不热心的。因为我认为他们学了本领是他们自己的，应靠自己的努力。在教学上的内容多是资产阶级的一套理论，对实用方面不重视，对辅导实习不热心，认为学好学坏也是他们自己的事。
    由于我的资产阶级学术思想，已经造成了不良后果。
    几年来我由于名利熏心，怕别人抢了自己的名，不愿把文献借给别人（如埃及吸虫书、英国双翅目吸血昆虫的书），标本也留为私有而不用来培养人材
  （如多年采集的蚊虫标本），同志们研究的成果不加鼓励不及时刊出（如山东丝虫病的研究）而压制了新生力量。最可恨的是已经研究出来的如用槟榔与南瓜子治绦虫的方法，不顾人民需要，在未发表之前不愿意外传，使自己成了垄断科学的资本家。但我还自认为是科学权威，自高自大目空一切，只看见自己为名为利的工作而看不起寄生虫病研究所、防疫站等机构，在为人民消灭寄生虫病上所作的巨大贡献。更可恨的是在上级决定将协和的寄生物学系与寄生虫病研究所合并时我还要留一部分人在北京做“理论研究”。
    由于我个人走资本主义道路，也影响系内有些讲师助教也走向了资产阶级的研究方向，辜负了党交给我培养社会主义建设接班人的任务。不止于此，我的资产阶级学术思想还影响了广大青年，有不少年轻同志也标榜了我的道路。
    去年冬天我在上海寄生虫病研究所对全体同志讲话时，说：“我们是研究机构，防疫站是搞实际防治工作的。”这就把研究工作和实际工作分割开来，造成很不好的影响。
    这次在北京全国医药卫生技术革命经验交流大会上对我的资产阶级学术思想进行了批判，不但对我是一个深刻的教育，我希望那些学我的同志也得到深刻的教育。
    过去我是不相信党能领导科学的，我认为党是领导政治的。具体的科学问题如研究方法、教学方法得通过科学家来领导。因此我对党在科学上的领导不满，当科学研究上与我个人利益有冲突时我就阳奉阴违，不接受党的领导、不照着党的意图办事。
    近年来的事实证明党是完全能领导科学的，而且为人民服务的科学只有在党的领导下走社会主义道路才能得到真正的发展。我决心抛弃我的旧意识，树立起无产阶级的科学观点，为全心全意为人民服务的科学而奋斗。
    决心转变，拔白旗，插红旗
    通过大家对我的揭发，经过我自己的检查与初步分析，我认识到我的资产阶级思想与作风是严重的。我自小受的是资产阶级教育，尤其是大部分的教育是在帝国主义在我国所设的学校内完成的，毕业之后又在帝国主义所办的协和内工作了二十多年，这些环境的培养，使我的资产阶级学术思想与观点有了巩固的基础，这样，我的研究工作就走上了为个人自私自利的资本主义道路。解放虽已九年，党和人民耐心地教育我帮助我，但是我自高自大、不可一世、不肯放下架子、不听别人的劝告，紧抓着原来的思想不肯放弃。其实这只是一个腐朽的资产阶级的臭架子，同志们的揭发救了我，我决心彻底改正以往的错误，虽然现在有了初步的认识，但希望大家继续不断的监督我，使我真正能得到脱胎换骨，以加倍工作来补偿我过去对党对人民所造成的损失。为此，我提出以下几点作为我努力的方向，并且保证加以实现：
    一、坚决服从党的绝对领导，执行党的政策，要做到任何事情经常向党请示，向党汇报。
    二、从根本上拔除以前的为名为利的科学研究思想，彻底破除我的权威思想和对自己的迷信，破除对洋人的迷信，任何工作都从六亿人民出发，从社会主义建设任务出发，虚心向群众学习，坚决依靠群众，作为一个普通的科学工作者。
    三、凡事要走群众路线，与群众打成一片，共同来完成国家的任务，并且时常关心群众，把群众的事看作自己的事。
    四、虚心听取群众的批评和意见，继续地经常地改正自己的错误。
    五、多看政治理论书籍，如马克思、列宁、毛主席的著作，从政治上思想上武装自己。
    六、从各方面以共产党员的风格要求自己，继续不断的拔白旗，插上红旗，在技术革命工作中和大家一起跃进。
