Advanced Thinking Leads to Mastery of Advanced Tools
    Xiaoji Commune Displays the Power of Rope-Drawn Machines Under Political Command
    Qingyang Commune Cadres' Conservatism Sends Rope-Drawn Machines into the Doldrums

    (By our report) The struggle between advanced and conservative thinking is still sharp in Jiangsu Province's promotion of rope-drawn machines. The result of this struggle is clearly reflected in the current deep plowing movement: areas that put politics in command and actively promote rope-drawn machines have made rapid progress in deep plowing; areas that adopt a passive and conservative attitude towards this advanced tool have seen slow progress in deep plowing.

    Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County and Qingyang People's Commune in Jiangyin County are two distinct contrasts. The "Deep Plowing Field Corps" of Xiaoji People's Commune took all active measures to fully utilize rope-drawn machines for deep plowing. After twenty days of hard work, they completed the task of deep plowing 84,000 mu of autumn-sown land eight days ahead of schedule, with a depth of more than one chi (foot). In contrast, the Qingyang People's Commune did not utilize all 381 rope-drawn machines in the commune, resulting in slow deep plowing progress and poor quality.

    The main reason why rope-drawn machines could not be promoted quickly is the conservative thinking of some cadres. Some commune cadres and leading comrades of Qingyang People's Commune believed that rope-drawn machines could be used in sandy soil areas but not in clay soil areas; they also believed that rope-drawn machines were bulky and not as convenient as iron picks and shovels; some areas did not use them because they were not used to them and did not try them out. This conservative thinking also existed in Xiaoji People's Commune, but the two communes took completely different attitudes towards this conservative thinking, which resulted in completely different effects.

    The Party Committee of Xiaoji People's Commune took an active and combative stance against conservative thinking. They rushed to produce 2,200 rope-drawn machines of various types in two days. The Party Committee of the commune took the lead in mastering one machine, set an example, and constantly trained key personnel. Each rope-drawn machine was mastered by a Party member and several Communist Youth League members. After setting an example, they also organized an on-site meeting to conduct airing of views, debates, and a "field competition" between rope-drawn machines and manual plowing. The facts educated the cadres and the masses that rope-drawn machines plowed deeper, more steadily, and faster, which greatly strengthened the confidence of the masses. All deep plowing of land in the commune used rope-drawn machines, and the efficiency of each rope-drawn machine increased from 2.5 mu per day to 4.5 mu, with the highest reaching 9 mu. The Party Committee of Qingyang People's Commune did not pay much attention to the use and promotion of rope-drawn machines from the beginning, but handed it over to the Finance and Trade Committee. When the Finance and Trade Committee was transferred to work on steel, no one was in charge.

    In the process of deep plowing with rope-drawn machines, Xiaoji People's Commune also attached great importance to the organization of labor and political and ideological work in the fields. The commune leaders revised the autumn sowing plan according to the crop harvesting and sowing stubble, and concentrated more than 12,000 people to form a "Deep Plowing Field Corps," which was stationed on the spot, eating and living in the fields. The Commune Party Committee also launched a "double opposition" and "five comparisons" competition in the fields. "Double opposition" means opposing conservatism and opposing waste. The "five comparisons" are: (1) compare ideology, (2) compare enthusiasm, (3) compare completion of tasks, (4) compare care for tools, and (5) compare quality. In terms of labor organization, a free combination method was adopted to establish opposing sides and launch competitions with each other. In order to thoroughly implement the "five comparisons," more than 1,600 big-character posters were posted in the fields and construction sites using forms such as big-character posters and field debates, so that many backward units and individuals quickly changed, and the advanced became more advanced, making the autumn plowing work lively. Although Qingyang People's Commune also organized a large number of laborers to camp in the fields, deep plowing and planting day and night, the progress of autumn plowing was greatly affected because the organization work and political work did not keep up in time, and conservative thinking hindered the promotion and use of rope-drawn machines.

    Another reason hindering the full promotion of rope-drawn machines is that the manufactured rope-drawn machines and deep plowing plows were not up to specifications. However, Xiaoji People's Commune and Qingyang People's Commune also took two completely different attitudes towards this issue. Xiaoji People's Commune paid great attention to using and improving the rope-drawn machines at the same time. They installed "chicken heart pellets" on the axis of the rope-drawn machine and installed soil scrapers and skids on the deep plowing plow, so the work efficiency was improved every day. They also took iron and wood workers from the farm tool factory as the backbone, absorbed skilled farmers to participate, and established a technical guidance and repair team to inspect and guide in the fields. If any damage was found, it was repaired in time to ensure that it could be put into battle. This repair team also created a pedal tractor-style rope-drawn machine, which plowed four to seven mu of land per day per machine. But the Party Committee of Qingyang People's Commune did the opposite. Instead of actively improving the rope-drawn machines that were not up to specifications, they put 381 rope-drawn machines aside.

    At present, the cadres and members of Xiaoji People's Commune, after completing the autumn plowing ahead of schedule, have won time and taken the initiative, and are actively carrying out land preparation and fertilization, and rushing to manufacture seeders. This year, they will change from hand sowing to dense planting and strip sowing with seeders. They plan to start autumn sowing in all aspects on the 15th and end the three-wheat sowing work on the 20th. Qingyang People's Commune has also learned its lesson, criticized conservative thinking, actively promoted and used rope-drawn machines, and accelerated the speed of autumn plowing.

### 先进思想才能掌握先进工具  小纪公社政治挂帅绳索牵引机大显威风  青暘公社干部保守绳索牵引机打入冷宫

    先进思想才能掌握先进工具
    小纪公社政治挂帅绳索牵引机大显威风
    青暘公社干部保守绳索牵引机打入冷宫
    本报讯　江苏省在推广绳索牵引机的过程中，先进与保守思想的斗争仍很尖锐。这一斗争的结果，鲜明地表现在目前的深翻土地的运动中：凡是政治挂帅，积极推广绳索牵引机的地区，深翻进度很快；凡是对这一先进工具采取消极保守态度的地区，深翻工作迟迟不得进展。
    江都县小纪人民公社和江阴县青暘人民公社就是两个鲜明的对比。小纪人民公社“深翻野战团”采取一切积极措施，全面使用绳索牵引机深耕土地，经过二十天的奋战，提前八天完成了八万四千亩秋播地的任务，深度在一尺以上。相反的，青暘人民公社因为没有把全社三百八十一部绳索牵引机使用起来，因而深翻进度很慢，质量也不好。
    绳索牵引机不能迅速推广的主要原因是某些干部思想上的保守思想作怪。青暘人民公社的社干部和某些领导同志认为绳索牵引机在沙土地区能用，粘土地区不能用；又认为绳索牵引机笨重，没有铁镐、大锹用起来方便；有的地区因使用不习惯，没有经过试耕就放着不用。这种保守思想在小纪人民公社也同样存在过，问题是两个公社对这种保守思想所采取的态度完全不同，因而就产生了完全不同的效果。
    小纪人民公社的党委对保守思想采取了积极的战斗的姿态。他们以两天的时间突击赶制了各种绳索牵引机二千二百部，社的党委带头掌握一部，做出样子，并不断培养骨干。每部绳索牵引机有一个党员和几个共青团员掌握。做出样子后，又专门组织了现场会议，进行鸣放辩论，并以绳索牵引机和人力翻耕进行“田头比武”。事实教育了干部和群众，绳索牵引机耕地又深又稳又快，这就大大坚定了群众的信心。全社的深翻土地全部使用了绳索牵引机，每部绳索牵引机的效率由原来的每天二点五亩上升到四点五亩，最高的达到九亩。青暘人民公社的党委对绳索牵引机的使用和推广，一开始就很不重视，只是交给财贸委员去搞，财贸委员调去搞钢铁，就形成无人负责的局面。
    在使用绳索牵引机深耕的过程中，小纪人民公社也十分重视劳动力的组织工作和田头的政治思想工作，公社领导上按照作物收割、播种茬口修订秋播规划，并集中组织了一万二千多人的“深翻野战团”，就地扎营，吃住田间。社党委又在田头上发动了一个“双反”和“五比”的竞赛。“双反”就是反保守、反浪费。“五比”是：（1）比思想，（2）比干劲，（3）比完成任务，（4）比爱护工具，（5）比质量。在劳动组织上，采取自由结合的方式，树立对立面，互相展开竞赛。为了深入贯彻“五比”，又在田头工地上利用大字报、田头辩论等形式，贴出一千六百多张大字报，使许多落后单位和个人迅速转变，先进的更先进，把秋耕工作搞得热火朝天。而青暘人民公社虽也组织了大批劳力在田头扎营，白天黑夜深翻抢种，但因为组织工作和政治工作没有及时跟上，保守思想阻碍了绳索牵引机的推广和使用，使秋耕的进度受到了很大影响。
    阻碍绳索牵引机全面推广的另一原因是制造的绳索牵引机和深耕犁不合规格。但是对这个问题，小纪人民公社和青暘人民公社也采取了两种截然不同的态度。小纪人民公社十分注意绳索牵引机的边使用，边改进。他们在绳索牵引机的轴心上装起“鸡心弹子”，在深耕犁上装上划土器、滑板，于是工效每天提高。他们并以农具厂铁木工人为骨干，吸收巧手农民参加，成立了技术指导修理组，在田头巡回检查指导，发现有损坏的及时修理，保证投入战斗。这个修理组并创造了一种脚踏拖拉机式绳索牵引机，每天每部耕田四亩到七亩。但青暘人民公社的党委恰恰相反，他们对制造不合规格的绳索牵引机不是积极的改进，反而把三百八十一部绳索牵引机搁置起来。
    目前，小纪人民公社的干部和社员在提前完成秋耕后，赢得了时间，取得了主动，正积极地进行整地施肥，赶制播种器，他们今年将改变过去用手撒种为用播种器密植条播，计划在15日即全面开始秋播，20日就可结束三麦播种工作。青暘人民公社也已接受教训，批判保守思想，积极推广和使用绳索牵引机，加快秋耕速度。
