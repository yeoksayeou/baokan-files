Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 23rd: Under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province, combined with the central tasks, seizing the gaps in production, and taking various measures to carry out a mass purchasing and marketing campaign, great achievements have been made. By the end of September, the total purchase of agricultural and sideline products in the province reached 389 million yuan, an increase of 61.7% over the same period last year. At present, various localities are seizing the acquisition of major products such as live pigs, cotton, jute, and mandarin oranges, and striving to comprehensively overfulfill this year's purchase plan.

At the beginning of August, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial financial and trade work conference and put forward the slogan: "Work hard for a hundred days, and strive to complete the annual purchase and sales plan one month ahead of schedule." After the meeting, all counties, led by the county party secretaries, launched a massive mass purchasing and marketing campaign. In light of the current new situation of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the rural people's communes, various localities have vigorously innovated purchasing and marketing methods and have now explored some successful experiences.

The first experience is that, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, all localities generally coordinate with the central work, tightly grasp the production gaps, intersperse purchasing and marketing activities, and carry out mass-based blitz purchasing and marketing campaigns. The Hengyang County Party Committee seized the agricultural gap before the harvesting of middle rice, and the first secretary of the county party committee personally took charge, organizing more than 50,000 people to carry out large-scale purchasing and marketing, acquiring more than 30,000 live pigs in three days, which is more than twice the total amount of live pig purchases in the entire Hengyang Special Zone in the first five days of August. More than ten counties, including Dongkou, Ningyuan, Longhui, Shaoyang, Hengyang, Changsha, and Pingjiang, have adopted this mass blitz acquisition method and have now completed their annual agricultural and sideline product acquisition plans ahead of schedule.

The second experience is to adopt the method of on-site inspection, on-site acquisition, on-site processing, and on-site storage in the communes in the main producing areas of cotton, ramie, and tea; and to promote the "credit sales" method in the key citrus producing areas, that is, entrusting the people's communes to grade, weigh, package, and transport themselves, and the purchasing departments only conduct spot checks and acceptance. After adopting these methods, the queuing phenomenon of past sales has been avoided, and the acquisition progress has been accelerated. Shimen County's cotton-producing area adopted the above method for acquisition, and by the beginning of October, more than 10,000 dan of ginned cotton had been acquired, five times more than the same period last year. Before implementing these acquisition methods, all localities have helped the people's communes train a large number of inspection and grading technicians and establish simple warehouses.

The third experience is that, in light of the new situation after the people's communes, where many commodities have changed from scattered purchases and sales by individual households to collective purchases and sales by communes and teams, various localities have carried out collective purchasing and marketing activities by communes and teams. This means that the commercial departments are linked to the communes and production teams, pre-negotiating the types and quantities of commodities that the communes need to sell and purchase, agreeing on the time and place, and the communes or production teams organize labor to collectively rush the delivery of goods during production gaps, and then bring back the required commodities. This year, the Dapu Purchasing and Marketing Store in Hengshan County carried out 94 collective purchasing and marketing activities by communes and teams, completing the purchasing and marketing plan for the third quarter twenty-one days ahead of schedule.

    依靠群众　见缝插针
    湖南购销工作取得三项经验
    据新华社长沙23日电　湖南省各级商业部门在党委统一领导、统一安排下，结合中心工作，抓住生产空隙，采取各种措施，开展群众性的大购大销运动，取得很大成绩。到9月底止，全省农副产品采购总额达三亿八千九百万元，比去年同期增加61.7％。目前各地正抓住生猪、棉花、黄麻、柑桔等主要产品的收购工作，力争全面超额完成今年的采购计划。
    8月初，中共湖南省委召开的全省财贸工作会议提出：“大干苦干一百天，力争提前一个月完成全年购销计划”的口号。会后，各县都由县委书记挂帅，开展了千军万马的群众大购大销运动。各地根据当前工农业大跃进和农村人民公社化的新形势，大力革新购销方式，现在已摸索出一些成功的经验。
    第一条经验是，各地普遍在党委统一领导下，配合中心工作，紧紧抓住生产间隙，把购销活动穿插进去，开展群众性的突击购销运动。中共衡阳县委抓住中稻收割前的农隙，由县委第一书记亲自出马，组织五万多人大购大销，三天收购生猪三万多头，比整个衡阳专区8月中旬头五天的生猪收购总量还多两倍。洞口、宁远、隆回、邵阳、衡阳、长沙、平江等十多个县，采取这种群众性的突击收购办法，现在都已提前完成全年农副产品的收购计划。
    第二条经验是，在棉花、苎麻、茶叶等主要产区，采取就社验收、就社收购、就社加工、就社保管的办法；在柑桔重点产区推行“信用交售”的办法，即委托人民公社自行分级、过秤、包装、运输，收购部门只进行抽查验收。采取这些办法后，避免了过去送售排队现象，加速了收购进度。石门县棉区采取上述方法收购，到10月上旬收购皮棉一万多担，比去年同期增加五倍。各地在实行这些收购方法前，都帮助人民公社训练大批验级技术人员，并建立简易仓库。
    第三条经验是，各地根据人民公社化后，许多商品已由一家一户的零星购销，变为以社、队为单位的集体购销的新情况，开展以社、队为单位的集体购销活动。就是由商业部门同公社、生产队挂钩，预先商定公社需要出售和购买的商品品种和数量，约定时间地点，由公社或生产队在生产间隙时间，组织劳力集体突击送货，然后又把所需要的商品带回。衡山县大浦购销商店今年以社、队为单位进行了九十四次集体购销活动，提前二十一天完成了第三季度的购销计划。
