Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: Anshan Iron and Steel's workers overfulfilled the state's steel production plan in the September high-yield month movement, with total production increasing by more than 70,000 tons compared to August. Currently, the workers are continuing the high-yield month movement, determined to achieve a larger leap forward in steel production in October, guaranteeing the completion of the annual production plan of 4.5 million tons of steel.

The completion of Anshan Iron and Steel's September steel production plan fully proves the importance of launching mass movements in large enterprises and proves the great role of the human factor. This month, there was no increase in steelmaking equipment, and difficulties such as insufficient auxiliary equipment and frequent furnace accidents were encountered at the beginning of the month. However, thanks to the workers' enthusiasm and overcoming the difficulties, especially the mass ideological emancipation movement launched in the last ten days of the month, the increase in steel production was finally guaranteed.

Anshan Iron and Steel's steel production increased particularly significantly in the last ten days of September. On the 25th, after listening to and discussing the mobilization report of Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, the workers' minds were further liberated, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. In the six days from the 25th to the 30th, the workers released two high-yield "satellites." Among them, the steel production on the 25th increased by more than 800 tons compared to the highest daily production record at the beginning of September, and the steel production on the 29th increased by more than 4,600 tons compared to the 25th. In these six days, the average daily production was nearly 2,000 tons more than the daily production in the first and middle ten days, which is equivalent to adding two large open-hearth furnaces.

In order to respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee to produce 10.7 million tons of steel throughout the year, Anshan Iron and Steel's workers adopted many measures to load more and refine quickly in September. Workers in the First Steelmaking Plant and the Second Steelmaking Plant, in order to ensure that the furnace body would not fail after expanding the open-hearth furnace charging capacity, launched a mass furnace maintenance movement, which greatly reduced furnace accidents and increased effective operation time. The Second Steelmaking Plant boldly expanded the open-hearth furnace charging capacity, and the average daily steel production in the middle and lower ten days increased by about 1,000 tons compared to the first ten days. After criticizing conservative ideas, the workers of the First Steelmaking Plant adopted the "molten iron carbon increase mixed steelmaking method," which significantly increased steel production in the last few days of the month.

The production results in September greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of Anshan Iron and Steel's workers. Since the end of September, the workers, combined with the discussion of Comrade Li Fuchun's report, have launched a mass airing of views, big debate, and big character posters, determined to strive for a greater victory on the steel front in October.

    证明大企业开展群众运动的重要性
    鞍钢上月增产钢七万吨
    新华社鞍山7日电　鞍钢职工在9月份高产月运动中超额完成了国家钢产量计划，总产量比8月份增加了七万多吨。目前职工们正在继续开展高产月运动，决定10月份使钢产量来一个更大的跃进，保证完成全年四百五十万吨钢的生产计划。
    鞍钢9月份钢产量计划的完成，充分证明了大企业开展群众运动的重要性，证明了人的因素的伟大作用。这个月炼钢设备并没有增加，并且在月初就遇到了辅助设备不足、炉体事故多等困难。但是由于职工们发挥了积极性，克服了困难，特别是在下旬开展了群众性的思想解放运动，终于保证了钢产量的增加。
    鞍钢的钢产量在9月下旬提高得特别显著。25日，职工们在听取和讨论了中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春同志的动员报告以后，思想进一步解放，生产热情空前高涨。在25日到30日的六天中，职工们就放出了两颗高产“卫星”。其中，25日的钢产量比9月初的最高日产纪录增产八百多吨，29日的钢产量又比25日增产四千六百多吨。这六天里，平均每天比上、中两旬的日产量多产钢近二千吨，等于增加了两座大型平炉。
    鞍钢职工为了响应党中央提出的全年产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大号召，在9月份里采取了许多多装快炼的措施。第一炼钢厂和第二炼钢厂职工，为了保证在扩大平炉装入量后使炉体不出故障，开展了群众性的维护炉体运动，使炉体事故大大减少，增加了有效作业时间。第二炼钢厂大胆地扩大了平炉装入量，中、下两旬钢的日产量平均比上旬增加一千吨左右。第一炼钢厂职工在批判了保守思想后，采用了“铁水增炭混合炼钢法”，使月末几天的钢产量有了显著增加。
    9月份的生产成果，大大鼓舞了鞍钢职工的干劲。从9月底以来，职工们结合讨论李富春同志的报告，又展开了大鸣大放大辩论，决心争取10月份在钢铁战线上打一个更大的胜仗。
