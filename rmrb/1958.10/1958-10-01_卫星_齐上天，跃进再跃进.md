"Satellites" Soaring Together, Leaping Forward Again

Today, as the people of the entire nation warmly celebrate the ninth anniversary of our great National Day, we report to everyone a series of good news: on September 29th, the national steel front launched "satellites" on a grand scale. In addition to Liaoning, where the daily output of pig iron and steel had already exceeded 10,000 tons, eight more provinces achieved a daily output of over 10,000 tons of pig iron, seventy-three counties achieved a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron, and two provinces achieved a daily output of 5,000 tons of steel, and one province achieved a daily output of 4,000 tons of steel. On this day, the national daily output of steel was nearly 60,000 tons, and the daily output of iron was nearly 300,000 tons. Around this time, industrial and transportation departments such as machinery, coal, electricity, transportation, geology, chemicals, and petroleum, as well as departments such as foreign trade, commerce, education, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, also launched "high-yield satellites" and "cooperation satellites" to support steel production. On September 28th, the number of railway cars loaded reached 52,000. On September 29th, the national coal production exceeded the one million ton mark. In the machinery industry, more than 60 major new products were presented as gifts for National Day. In the electricity industry, the installed capacity of power generation equipment put into production from January to September was 42% more than the installed capacity for the entire last year. "Satellites" launched by other industries and regions, and by various enterprises, are too numerous to mention. Such an unprecedented scene of a hundred flowers blooming, a riot of color, and provinces, cities, autonomous regions, factories, mines, enterprises, and various central departments across the country launching "satellites" around steel production is a great review of our country's production power, and a victory for the mass line of the entire people running industry and all undertakings, and for the spirit of communist cooperation. It heralds that October will be a high-yield month for steel production and other industrial production, and heralds that the development of steel production and other industrial production in our country will have a greater leap forward. We warmly congratulate the brilliant victories already achieved on the steel front and other fronts, and hope that the people of the whole country will continue to work hard and strive to complete and overfulfill the October and annual steel production plans and the entire national economic plan!

The steel production in September ended in a high tide of launching "satellites." September, in the entire battle to complete the production plan of 10.7 million tons of steel, was only a mobilization stage, a training stage, and a preparation stage, a month of laying the foundation. Over the past month, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels have grasped steel, 50 million people across the country have gone to mines and furnaces, and the number of built native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces has surged to 600,000. The construction of small native steelmaking furnaces is also catching up rapidly. A vigorous mass movement of the entire people running the steel industry has begun to take shape. How can we achieve the entire people running the steel industry? By combining large-scale enterprises with medium and small-scale enterprises, using both native and foreign methods, and currently focusing on the method of "small, native, and mass." With the direction accurately identified, the movement of the entire people running steel industry is like a raging fire, and the light of communist cooperation thought of "stopping cars to give way, prioritizing steel" shines everywhere. At the end of September, "satellites" launched across the country are the inevitable result of the development of this mass movement and communist cooperation thought. Of course, the level of "satellites" is not a level that can be reached regularly. Turning the level of "satellites" into a regular level requires a process. But with so many "satellites," this proves that as long as efforts are made, the average daily output of steel in our country can reach 60,000 tons in October, the average daily output of iron can exceed 100,000 tons, and the work of various departments such as coal, machinery, and transportation that ensure the steel marshal's ascent can all develop by leaps and bounds. In this way, we have sufficient basis to say with full confidence: the plan to double steel production this year will definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

If anyone does not believe it, we can calculate a few accounts.

Taking pig iron as an example, in addition to Liaoning, eight more provinces have emerged with a daily output of over 10,000 tons of pig iron, of which Henan Province's daily pig iron output has reached more than 90,000 tons, Shandong Province's daily pig iron output has exceeded 60,000 tons, and Hebei Province's daily pig iron output has reached more than 50,000 tons. This is indeed only a one-day record, and it may not be easy to consolidate such a high-yield record in a very short time, but we believe that since such a level has been reached, we can maintain such a level in the future as long as we continue to work hard. Taking a step back, even if the level of 90,000 tons per day in Henan, 60,000 tons per day in Shandong, and 50,000 tons per day in Hebei cannot be consolidated, and only 10,000 tons per day can be produced, then with nine provinces producing 10,000 tons of pig iron per day, we can also produce more than 8.2 million tons of pig iron in the ninety-two days from October 1st to the end of the year, plus the estimated cumulative output of pig iron nationwide has reached more than 6 million tons by the end of September, so a total of more than 15 million tons of pig iron can be produced by the end of the year, which can already meet the needs of steelmaking. Moreover, in addition to the nine 10,000-ton provinces, there are more than a dozen provinces and autonomous regions whose pig iron production is also catching up rapidly. Adding this part of the output, we can more guarantee that there will be enough pig iron to supply the needs of steelmaking.

Looking at the steelmaking situation again, the daily output of steel on September 29th was close to 60,000 tons. If we continue to work hard in the next ninety-two days to reach the level of 60,000 tons per day, we can produce more than 5.5 million tons of steel by the end of the year, plus the estimated cumulative output of steel nationwide has reached more than 5 million tons by the end of September, so the production plan of 10.7 million tons of steel by the end of the year can definitely be completed. Moreover, a large number of small converters and native steelmaking furnaces will be put into production in the next three months. With such a new force, there is a reliable guarantee for completing the plan to double steel production.

As for the issues of coke, transportation, smelting equipment, etc., the emergence of "satellites" also makes it easy to guarantee the needs of steel industry development. Taking railway transportation as an example, the number of railway cars loaded on September 28th reached 52,000. If the average number of railway cars loaded per day can be maintained at a level of 40,000 to 50,000 in the next three months, steel production will not be delayed.

The launch of a large number of "satellites" across the country proves that we have strong production strength, we can make many amazing miracles, and we are fully confident of completing the production plan of 10.7 million tons of steel. Of course, this does not mean that there will be no difficulties on the road ahead, that we can be complacent and slack off, or that there is no need to do any more work. No, to consolidate and expand the results of "high-yield satellites," we still have to do a lot of arduous work and continue to fight hard. If we do not continue to fight hard, the record of "high-yield satellites" will be difficult to consolidate, and it will be even more impossible to expand the results.

From the current situation, pig iron production still has to pass two hurdles. One is to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest, and the other is to protect native blast furnaces through the winter. Nine provinces have reached the level of 10,000 tons of pig iron per day, and the area of the bumper harvest can be said to be very large, but it is still not enough to have only nine provinces producing 10,000 tons of pig iron per day. Because some provinces may not be able to stabilize their production due to some special reasons, there is a need for more provinces to reach the level of 10,000 tons of pig iron per day. Protecting native blast furnaces through the winter is a new problem in pig iron production. The so-called "wintering" is, on the one hand, to change cold air to hot air to solve the problem of keeping warm, and on the other hand, to reserve ore and fuel. If these two aspects are not resolved, when winter comes, the native blast furnaces will not be able to withstand the cold, and mining and transportation will also be affected, and the native blast furnaces will not be able to produce normally.

Steelmaking production also has to pass two hurdles. One is the question of whether the method of "small, native, and mass" can be implemented, and the other is the problem of native iron steelmaking. It has been proven by many facts that developing pig iron production using the method of "small, native, and mass" can achieve high speed. But many people doubt whether the method of "small, native, and mass" can be used in steelmaking. The current situation is that large, foreign open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces do bear most of the steelmaking tasks, but relying solely on these will certainly not be able to complete all the steelmaking tasks, which requires thinking about other "small, native, and mass" methods. Can the method of "small, native, and mass" produce steel? Yes. Henan and Sichuan, two provinces with a daily output of 5,000 tons of steel, are proof. Every province should use the method of "small, native, and mass" to develop steelmaking production. As for native iron steelmaking, it is a new problem in steelmaking production. Native iron is the iron produced by native blast furnaces, and compared to the foreign iron produced by foreign blast furnaces, it has a higher content of sulfur and phosphorus, so it is certainly not as good as foreign iron for steelmaking. However, more than half of the pig iron produced this year is native iron. Not only native steelmaking furnaces have to use native iron, but foreign steelmaking furnaces also have to use native iron. However, if the hurdle of good native iron steelmaking is not passed, the plan to double steel production cannot be realized. As for departments such as coal, transportation, machinery, and electricity, there is also a lot of work to do to consolidate the results of "satellites" and ensure that the needs of steel industry development are met, and it is not possible to describe them in detail here.

In summary, in order to consolidate the results of "satellites" and achieve a greater leap forward, we must continue to vigorously engage in mass movements. Why have so many "satellites" been launched in such a short period of time? The main reason is that the general line of socialist construction has been implemented, and the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, giving equal importance to central industry and local industry, giving equal importance to large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, and using both native and foreign methods has been implemented, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses and forming a vigorous mass movement of the entire people running industry. Without such a large-scale mass movement, relying solely on a few people "burying their heads in hard work" would not have resulted in so many "satellites," and the speed of production development would not have been so fast. After entering October, there is no other way to consolidate the results of "satellites" and achieve a greater leap forward except to vigorously engage in mass movements. The mass movement is our magic weapon for doing everything. If we lose this magic weapon, we will accomplish nothing. While continuing to grasp the mass movement, we must also continue to grasp cooperation. Cooperation is also a fundamental reason why so many "satellites" were launched at the end of September. Many departments and many enterprises have carried forward the communist style of selflessness and done everything possible to support steel production. In the next three months, the tense situation of materials, equipment, transportation, labor, etc. will certainly still exist. Therefore, while vigorously engaging in mass movements, we must continue to promote the spirit of cooperation, advocate mutual support, and jointly complete the steel production tasks.

The steel battle of October has begun. This is a crucial battle. If the steel production plan for October is completed, then completing the plan to double the annual steel production will be a sure thing. Now, we already have the foundation laid in September, and so many inspiring "satellites" have emerged. Let us hold high the banner of victory and move forward at a faster pace!

    “卫星”齐上天，跃进再跃进
    今天，正当全国人民热烈庆祝伟大国庆九周年的时候，我们向大家报告一束好消息：9月29日，全国钢铁战线大放“卫星”，除了辽宁生铁和钢的日产量早已超过万吨外，又出现了八个日产万吨以上生铁的省，七十三个日产千吨生铁的县和两个日产五千吨钢、一个日产四千吨钢的省。这一天，全国钢的日产量近六万吨，铁的日产量近三十万吨。在这前后，机械、煤炭、电力、运输、地质、化学、石油等工业交通部门和对外贸易、商业、教育、中国人民解放军等部门，为支援钢铁生产也大放“高产卫星”和“协作卫星”。9月28日，铁路的装车数已达五万二千辆。9月29日，全国煤炭产量已突破百万吨大关。机械工业方面，向国庆献礼的重大新产品多达六十余种。电力工业方面，1月至9月投入生产的发电设备容量，比去年全年安装的发电设备容量还多42％。其他各行各业、各地各企业放出的“卫星”举不胜举。这样一个百花争艳，万紫千红，全国各省、市、自治区、各厂矿企业和中央各个部门围绕钢铁生产大放“卫星”的空前盛况，是对我国生产力量的一次大检阅，是全民办工业，全民办一切事业的群众路线和共产主义协作精神的胜利。它预告着十月将是钢铁生产和其他工业生产的高产月，预告着我国钢铁生产和其他工业生产的发展将有更大的飞跃。我们热烈地祝贺钢铁战线和其他战线上已经取得的辉煌胜利，希望全国人民再接再厉，为完成和超额完成十月份的和全年的钢铁生产计划和整个国民经济计划而奋斗！
    9月份的钢铁生产，在大放“卫星”的高潮中结束了。9月，在整个完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产计划的战役中，还只是动员阶段、练兵阶段、准备阶段，是打基础的一个月。这一个月来，各级党委第一书记抓钢铁，全国五千万人分赴矿山和炉旁，已建成的土高炉和小高炉激增至六十万座，小的土炼钢炉的建设也在急起直追。一个轰轰烈烈的全民办钢铁工业的群众运动已经开始形成了。怎么能够做到全民办钢铁工业呢？用大型企业和中小型企业相结合、土洋并举，而在目前以“小，土，群”为主的办法办。方向摸准了，全民办钢铁的运动势如烈火，“停车让路，优先为钢”的共产主义协作思想的光芒到处闪耀。9月底，全国各地大放“卫星”，正是这个群众运动和共产主义协作思想发展的必然结果。当然，“卫星”的水平还不是经常能达到的水平。要把“卫星”的水平变成经常的水平还需要一个过程。但是有了这么多的“卫星”，这就证明了只要经过努力，十月份我国钢的平均日产量能够到达六万吨，铁的平均日产量能够超过十万吨，煤炭、机械、运输等保证钢铁元帅升帐的各个部门的工作，都能够飞跃地发展。这样，我们就有了足够的根据，满怀信心地说：今年钢产翻一番的计划一定能完成和超额完成。
    谁若不信，我们可以算几笔账。
    拿生铁来说，全国除了辽宁以外又出现了八个日产万吨以上生铁的省，其中河南省的生铁日产量已达九万多吨，山东省的生铁日产量已超过六万吨，河北省的生铁日产量已达五万多吨。这固然只是一天的纪录，在很短的时间内要巩固这样的高产纪录，可能不很容易，但是我们相信既然达到了这样的水平，今后只要继续努力也一样能保持这样的水平。退一步说，即使河南日产九万吨，山东日产六万吨，河北日产五万吨的水平不能巩固，只能日产一万吨，那么，有了九个日产万吨生铁的省，从10月1日起到年底的九十二天里，我们也可以生产八百二十多万吨生铁，再加上到9月底，估计全国生铁累计产量已达六百多万吨，这样到年底总共可以生产一千五百多万吨生铁，已经可以满足炼钢的需要。何况除了九个万吨省之外，还有十几个省和自治区，他们的生铁生产也在急起直追。再算上这一部分产量，我们更可以保证有足够的生铁供应炼钢需要。
    再看炼钢的情况。9月29日钢的日产量已接近六万吨，如果在今后的九十二天中继续努力，达到日产六万吨的水平，到年底就可以生产五百五十多万吨钢，再加上到9月底，估计全国钢的累计产量已达五百几十万吨，这样到年底一千零七十万吨钢的生产计划肯定可以完成。何况在今后三个月里还有大批小转炉和土炼钢炉投入生产。多了这样一支生力军，完成钢产翻一番的计划也就有可靠的保证了。
    至于焦炭问题，运输问题，冶炼设备问题等等，由于“卫星”的出现，也不难保证钢铁工业发展的需要。拿铁路运输来说，9月28日的装车数已达五万二千辆，如果今后三个月内每天平均装车数能够保持在四万辆至五万辆的水平，就不致耽误钢铁的生产了。
    全国各地大批“卫星”上天，证明了我们拥有雄厚的生产实力，我们可以做出许多惊人的奇迹来，完成一千零七十万吨钢的生产计划有充分的把握。当然，这并不是说在今后前进的道路上就没有困难了，就可以自满和松劲了，就不需要再做什么工作了。不，要巩固和扩大“高产卫星”的成果，还要做很多艰巨的工作，还要继续苦战。不继续苦战，“高产卫星”的纪录固然难以巩固，扩大战果更不可能。
    从目前情况来看，生铁生产还要过两关。一是争取大面积丰收，一是保护土高炉过冬。九个省达到日产万吨生铁的水平，丰收的面积可以说是很大的了，但仅有九个日产万吨生铁的省总还是不够的。因为可能有一些省由于一些特殊的原因产量不能稳定，这就需要有更多的省能达到日产万吨生铁的水平。保护土高炉过冬是生铁生产上的一个新问题。所谓“过冬”，一方面是改冷风为热风，解决御寒的问题；另一方面是储备矿石和燃料的问题。这两方面的问题不解决，冬季来到，土高炉受不了寒，采矿和运输也将受到影响，土高炉就不可能正常生产。
    炼钢生产也要过两关。一是“小、土、群”的办法能否贯彻的问题，一是土铁炼钢的问题。用“小、土、群”的办法发展生铁生产才能争得高速度，已经被许多事实证明了。但在炼钢方面能不能用“小、土、群”的办法，还有许多人怀疑。现在的情况是大的、洋的平炉、转炉和电炉，确实担负了大部分炼钢任务，但只靠这些肯定不能完成全部炼钢任务，这就需要另外再想“小、土、群”的办法。“小、土、群”的办法能不能炼出钢来呢？能。河南、四川两个日产五千吨钢的省就是证明。各个省都应该用“小、土、群”的办法来发展炼钢生产。至于土铁炼钢是炼钢生产上的新问题。土铁就是土高炉出的铁，它同洋高炉出的洋铁比起来，硫的成份和磷的成份都比较高一些，用来炼钢当然不如洋铁。但今年生产的生铁中半数以上都是土铁，不仅土炼钢炉要用土铁，洋炼钢炉也要用土铁。不过好土铁炼钢这一关，钢产翻一番的计划就不能实现。至于煤炭、运输、机械、电力等部门要巩固“卫星”成果，保证满足钢铁工业发展的需要，也有许多工作要做，这里不能一一细述。
    总起来说，为了巩固“卫星”成果，实现更大的跃进，必须继续大搞群众运动。为什么在这么短的期间，会有这么多的“卫星”上天呢？最主要的原因，就是贯彻执行了社会主义建设总路线，贯彻执行了工业和农业并举、中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举、土洋并举的方针，把广大群众的积极性调动起来，形成了一个轰轰烈烈的全民办工业的群众运动。如果没有这样一个规模壮阔的群众运动，只靠少数人“埋头苦干”，就不会有这么多的“卫星”，生产发展的速度也就不会这么快。在进入10月份之后，要巩固“卫星”成果，实现更大的跃进，除了必须大搞群众运动以外，没有别的办法。群众运动是我们办一切事业的法宝，丢掉这个法宝，我们就一事无成。在继续抓群众运动的同时，还要继续抓协作。9月底能有这么多的“卫星”上天，协作也是一个根本原因。许多部门、许多企业发扬了舍己为人的共产主义风格，尽一切力量支援钢铁生产。在今后三个月里，材料、设备、运输、劳动力等等的紧张状况肯定还是存在的。因此，在大搞群众运动的时候，还必须继续发扬协作精神，提倡互相支援，共同完成钢铁生产任务。
    10月份的钢铁大战开始了。这是关键性的一战。如果10月份钢铁生产计划完成了，那末，完成全年钢产加番的计划就能稳操胜券。现在，我们已经有了9月份打下的基础，有
  了这么许多鼓舞人心的“卫星”出现，让我们高举胜利的红旗，用更快的速度前进吧！
