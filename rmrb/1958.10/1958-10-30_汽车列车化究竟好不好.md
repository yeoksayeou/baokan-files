Highway transportation departments in various regions are vigorously building trailers and implementing automobile train-like assemblies, striving to double transportation capacity. In Shandong Province alone, more than 2,000 trailers were built in September, increasing carrying capacity by more than 6,000 tons. This is a major measure to solve the tense situation of highway transportation.

The so-called automobile train-like assembly is to organize automobile towing transport. A loaded freight car is followed by one or more square hopper cars. People call these hopper cars "trailers" and the cars that tow the hopper cars "main cars." If all highway freight cars in a region are equipped with trailers, this is automobile train-like assembly. Automobile towing transport can make full use of the equipment functions of the car engine and give play to the inherent traction capacity of the car itself. In addition to its own load capacity, a loaded freight car can also tow a load that is three, ten, twenty, or even thirty times greater than its own. The manufacture of trailers is also very simple, unlike car manufacturing, which requires a large amount of steel, with low cost and great effect.

Automobile towing transport has existed in various countries around the world, but it is not common. As for automobile train-like assemblies, no country has ever had them. Now our country's highways have begun to implement automobile train-like assemblies. We not only tow one, but many. In May of this year, cars in Jiangsu Province towed 26 trailers, carrying more than 60 tons of goods. In August, cars in Beijing surpassed Jiangsu, towing 46 trailers, carrying 143 tons. At the end of September, cars in Heilongjiang Province surpassed Beijing again, towing 78 trailers, carrying 166 tons. Although this kind of long train is still a typical experiment, it has opened up a new situation in the technical revolution of automobile transportation. Automobile towing transport is not only important in the current situation of tight transportation, few cars, and many goods, but also has significant savings implications in the period of normal transportation and balanced car-to-cargo ratio.

However, some comrades still hold a skeptical attitude towards the realization of automobile train-like assemblies and the vigorous trailer building movement. They worry that the roads are not good and the speed is too slow; they are afraid that car parts are easily damaged and driving is unsafe, and they are also afraid of violating traffic management rules. In short, they do not understand the idea of automobile train-like assemblies.

"Steep slopes and sharp bends, rough roads, I am afraid that the promotion of towing is not feasible." Are roads a condition for driving? It is a condition. Sharp bends and steep slopes are not only inconvenient for towing transport, but even single-car driving is not convenient. The essence of the problem is whether the car should obey the road, or the road should adapt to the car? Cars and roads are mutually adapted, but mainly the road should adapt to the needs of transportation tools. With roads alone, goods cannot move on their own. The purpose of building roads is ultimately for the operation of vehicles. Since the road should be suitable for cars, why can't we change the sharp bends and steep slopes to pave the way for automobile towing transport? What's more, the roads in mountainous or hilly areas are not impossible to drive cars with trailers. Towing one trailer can pass a 15% slope; towing two trailers can pass an 8% slope, which was proven as early as 1953.

"Towing transport, the speed is like an ox cart, how can this work!" No one opposes the requirement of fast car speed. But in transportation economic theory and practice, the speed and load of vehicles are inseparable. Only seeking vehicle speed, regardless of the effect of carrying capacity, loses the meaning of transportation. Of course, towing a trailer will slow down the speed of the car, but this is only one aspect; on the other hand, the weight of goods towed greatly exceeds the load capacity of the single car itself. The weight that a car can tow is at least more than twice its own, and its economic effect is far greater than that of single-car transportation. Moreover, the actual speed of towing transport is not very slow. According to the recent test car record of Heilongjiang Province, a main car towing six trailers, carrying a total of 26 tons, travels at about 25 kilometers per hour on a relatively flat road. Is it an ox cart? No ox cart can reach a speed of 25 kilometers per hour. So, what about the speed of a car without towing a trailer? Under the road conditions in our country, the general speed is only about 45 kilometers per hour. As for the economic relationship between speed and cargo, we can also calculate it. In a transportation distance of 100 kilometers, to transport 20 tons of goods from place A to place B, if using one car with three trailers, it can be transported in one trip, and it can arrive in four hours. If only using a single car, it will take eight round trips to completely transport the goods from place A to place B, including round-trip time, which will take 18 hours. It can be seen that in the case of few cars and many goods, implementing automobile towing transport is not "too slow speed," but a very good transportation effect.

"It's too damaging to the car! Won't it shorten the life of the car?" The life of a car lies in regular maintenance and skilled driving operation technology. Towing transport is not "eating the car," but just making full use of the inherent equipment functions of the engine. In mechanical movement, some parts such as gears, bearings, cylinder liners, etc., wear and tear are inevitable. Towing a trailer will wear out the car; without towing, as long as the engine is working, it will still wear out. Will towing a trailer that is too heavy cause wear and tear? This is also possible. But what's so great about replacing parts when they wear out? Moreover, we do not advocate towing too heavily, as long as we use the inherent towing function of the vehicle, it will not harm the life of the car. To take a step back, even if towing a trailer does "reduce the life of the car by half," it is worth it. Because one car has already been used as three cars. Of course, this is an assumption. The argument that the life of the car will be reduced by half does not exist.

"What if the car overturns! There are safety problems." We say that there is no absolute unsafety, nor is there absolute safety. It depends on people, and safety can be mastered. There are safety problems even if the car does not tow a trailer, and it can also be safe to tow a trailer with increased vigilance. It is a good thing to be vigilant about safety issues; being afraid of accidents and shrinking back is conservative. With new things like automobile train-like assemblies, there will inevitably be new driving operation techniques. It is not feasible to use the old experience of driving a single car to deal with the new technology of automobile trains. The key is to summarize new technical operation experience, make technical experience summaries, and promote them. There is nothing special about this, in a word: be careful of the tail behind the car. Start and stop slowly, and avoid oncoming cars early. That's all!

"The tail is too long, doesn't it violate traffic rules?" New productive forces are about to overturn the old regulations that bind them. With the appearance of automobile train-like assemblies, traffic management regulations should be revised. The tail of the car is too long, and under flat and straight road conditions, as long as the car has sufficient traction capacity, it may not be impossible. But this is a way of operation under special conditions and should not be universally promoted. One car with three trailers is good, and one car with five trailers is also possible. The most superior is to use large-tonnage trailers. Implement a towing method of one six-ton trailer and one car with two trailers. This is a new trend in automobile transportation, and traffic management rules should be appropriately modified based on this new trend.

All the arguments against automobile train-like assemblies are untenable and cannot hinder the development of automobile train-like assemblies. Freight cars must be towed, which is the direction of our country's development of automobile transportation.

The current questions are: How to build cars? How to repair roads?

Building cars. Small-tonnage trailers are easy to mobilize the masses to build in the current period. Large-tonnage trailers have good effects, but the technology is more complicated and requires specialized factories to manufacture them. Building trailers by combining the mobilization of the masses with specialized factory manufacturing will speed up development and gradually improve.

Repairing roads. Highways must meet the requirements of automobile driving, and achieve "straight, flat, wide, and solid." All routes that run automobile trains must be widened in terms of roadbeds and pavements as needed, reducing the radius of curves and gradients, and even cutting curves and straightening roads. At the same time, bridges and culverts must be strengthened to increase load capacity. Now the width of newly built roads in Henan Province generally reaches nine meters. The large ones reach fifteen meters, and the small ones must also have five meters. Add a gravel pavement to achieve all-weather traffic. Not only should new roads be like this, but old roads should also be technically renovated according to the driving requirements of automobile trains. This is conducive to the development of the automobile train-like assembly movement.

At present, transportation is very tight, and the distribution of mining areas and small blast furnaces and earthen furnaces is mostly in mountainous areas. Land transportation requirements mainly rely on automobiles and highways. To solve the contradiction of few cars and many goods, implementing automobile train-like assemblies can have immediate results.

    汽车列车化究竟好不好
    张启宗
    各地公路运输部门正在大造挂车，实行汽车列车化力争运力加番。仅山东省九月份就自造挂车二千多辆，增加载重能力六千多吨。这是解决公路运输紧张状况的一项重大措施。
    所谓汽车列车化，就是组织汽车拖挂运输。一辆载重货运汽车，尾后挂上一辆或多辆方形斗车，人们把这种斗车称为“挂车”，把拖带斗车的汽车称为“主车”。如果一个地区公路货运汽车都挂上挂车，这就是汽车列车化了。汽车拖挂运输可以充分利用汽车发动机的设备功能，发挥汽车本身所固有的牵引能力。一辆载重货运汽车，除了它本身的载重能量外，还可以拖载比它本身载重大过三倍、十倍、二十倍，以至于拖载三十倍的能力。挂车制造也很简便，不像汽车制造那样要用大量钢材，成本低，效果大。
    汽车拖挂运输，世界各国都曾有过，但并不普遍。至于汽车列车化，各国都未有过。现在我国公路已开始实行汽车列车化。我们不只挂一辆，而是挂上好多辆。今年五月间，江苏省汽车挂过二十六辆，拖载货物六十多吨。八月间，北京市汽车赶过江苏，挂了四十六辆，拖载一百四十三吨。九月底，黑龙江省汽车又赛过北京，挂了七十八辆，拖载一百六十六吨。这种长列车，虽然还是典型实验，但已打开了汽车运输技术革命的新局面。汽车拖挂运输，不仅在目前运输紧张车少货多的情况下有重要的作用，即在运输正常车货平衡的时期也有重大的节约意义。
    但是，也还有一些同志对于实现汽车列车化，大搞挂车运动，抱着怀疑态度，他们顾虑道路不行，速度太慢；他们害怕汽车机件容易损坏，行驶不安全，还怕违反交通管理规则。总之，对于汽车列车化，思想不通。
    “坡陡湾急路不平，推广拖挂怕不行。”道路是不是行车的条件？是个条件。急湾陡坡，不只对拖挂运输行驶不便，即便不拖挂车，单一汽车行驶也不便捷。问题的本质是要车服从路，还是要路适应车？车与路是互相适应的，但主要是公路适应运输工具的需要。光有公路，货物不能自行。造路的目的终究是为了车辆的运行。既然路应适合于车，为什么不可以改一下急弯陡坡，为汽车拖挂运输铺平道路呢？何况山区或丘陵地带的公路，也非不能行驶拖带挂车的汽车。挂一辆，可以通过15％的坡度；挂两辆，可以通过8％的坡度，这是1953年早已证明了的。
      “拖挂运输，速度像牛车，这那能行！”汽车要求速度快，无人反对。但在运输经济理论上和实践上，车辆的速度与载重不可分离。光求车速，不顾载运效果，就失去运输的意义。固然，拖了挂车，汽车行驶速度是要慢些，但这只是一方面；另一方面是货物拖载的重量大大超过单一汽车本身的载重能量。一辆汽车可以拖载的重量至少也大于本身的两倍，它所具有的经济效果远比单一汽车运输大得多。而且拖挂运输实际时速也并不很慢。据黑龙江省最近试车纪录，一辆主车拖带六辆挂车，共计载重二十六吨，在比较平坦的道路上行驶，每小时大约走二十五公里左右。是牛车吗？没有哪一辆牛车时速可以达到二十五公里。那么，不拖挂车的汽车的速度又如何呢？在我国道路条件下，一般时速也不过四十五公里左右。至于时速与货载在经济上的关系还可以算一笔账。在一百公里的运输距离内，运送二十吨货物从甲地到乙地，如果用一车三挂，连载加拖一次运送，四小时可以到达。如果只用一辆单车，要来回运送八次，才能把货物从甲地完全运到乙地，往返时间都算在内，要花十八小时。可见在车少货多的情况下，实行汽车拖挂运输，不是“时速太慢”，而是运输效果极好。
    “太伤车了！岂不缩短汽车寿命吗？”汽车寿命在于经常保养和熟练的驾驶操作技术。拖挂运输不是在“吃车”，只是充分利用发动机所固有的设备功能。在机械运动中，某些机件如齿轮、轴承、汽缸套等等，磨耗是免不了的。拖带挂车，汽车有磨耗；不拖带，只要发动机在工作，也还是要磨耗。拖带挂车过重，是否会有磨耗？这也是有的。但是部件有磨耗，可以配换又有什么了不起的呢？况且我们并不提倡过重地拖带，只要是利用车辆固有的牵行功能，也无伤于汽车寿命。退一步说，即便拖带挂车确实“减少汽车寿命一半”，那也值得。因为一辆汽车已经当作了三辆使用。当然，这是假设。所谓汽车寿命会减少一半的论据并不存在。
      “翻了车怎么得了！安全有问题。”我们说，没有绝对的不安全，也没有绝对的安全。事在人为，安全可以掌握。汽车不拖带挂车也有安全问题，拖带了挂车提高警惕也能安全。警惕安全问题是好事；害怕肇事畏缩不前，这就是保守。有了汽车列车化这样的新事物，也必然有新的驾驶操作技术。用驾驶单车的老经验对付汽车列车的新技术，是不行的。关键在于总结新的技术操作经验，作出技术经验总结，推而广之。这里头，也没有什么特殊的问题，一句话：当心汽车后面的尾巴。起步停车要缓，避开迎面来车宜早。如此而已！
      “尾巴拖得老长，不违反交通规则吗？”新的生产力就是要反掉束缚它的旧规章。汽车出现列车化，交通管理制度应当修改。汽车尾巴拖得老长，在平直的道路条件下，只要汽车有足够的牵引能力，未始不可。但这是特殊条件下的运转方式，不宜普遍推广。一车三挂是好的，一车五挂也行。最优越的是用大吨位挂车。实行一挂六吨、一车两挂的拖挂方式。这是汽车运输的新趋势，交通管理规则应当根据这个新的趋势，适当修改。
    所有一切反对汽车列车化的论点，都是站不住脚的，都不能阻碍汽车列车化的发展。货运汽车一定要搞拖挂，这是我国发展汽车运输的方向。
    现在问题是：如何造车？如何修路？
    造车。小吨位的挂车，在目前时期便于发动群众大家造。大吨位的挂车效果好，但技术比较复杂一些，要有专门的工厂制造。用发动群众与专门工厂制造相结合的办法大造挂车，发展速度就会快些，而且可以逐步提高。
    修路。公路一定要适应汽车行驶的要求，做到“直、平、宽、实”。凡是行驶汽车列车的路线，都要根据需要加宽路基和路面，削减弯道半径和坡度，以至于裁弯取直。同时要加固桥梁和涵洞，增加负荷能力。现在河南省新建公路宽度，一般达到九公尺。大的达到十五公尺，小的也要有五公尺。加铺石子路面，达到晴雨通车。不仅新路应该如此，旧路也要按照汽车列车的行驶要求，实行技术改造。这样做，有利于汽车列车化运动的发展。
    目前运输十分紧张，而且矿区和小高炉土炉的分布，大都在山区，陆路，运输要求主要依靠汽车和公路。要解决车少货多的矛盾，实现汽车列车化，就能立竿见影。
