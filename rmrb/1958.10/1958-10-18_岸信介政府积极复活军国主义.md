The Kishi Nobusuke Government Actively Revives Militarism
Liu Chu
Although Japan lost its colonies after the war and was in the position of an occupied country, the original militarist war machine was destroyed to a certain extent. However, Japan's monopoly capital was preserved because the United States attempted to use Japan as its tool of aggression in the Far East; and in the process of serving the US aggression policy, it has been further developed.

During the Korean War, Japanese monopoly capital made a fortune relying on US military orders, which stimulated the development of domestic production. Japan's industrial production index quickly exceeded pre-war levels in 1951, reaching 1.6 times pre-war levels in 1953. After the Korean armistice, US military orders decreased somewhat, but monopoly capital cruelly exploited the workers and peasants, expanded equipment investment, and developed export trade, and production continued to rise. The industrial production index reached a maximum of 2.7 times pre-war levels in 1957.

The development of production prompted monopoly capital to compete for markets and find outlets for its product and capital exports. In this way, Japanese monopoly capital relived the old dream of militarism; striving to make a comeback and reassert hegemony in the Far East. Successive Japanese cabinets after the war have made a series of preparations to revive militarism; and Nobusuke Kishi, who represents the interests of monopoly capital, has been the most active in this regard.

        Actively Reorganizing Armaments

Since Japan began rearming in 1950, it has established a considerable army of approximately 240,000 people; far exceeding the armed forces of Germany before Hitler came to power (at that time, Germany's military force was only 100,000 people). According to the current three-year military expansion plan being implemented by the Japanese Defense Agency, when the plan is completed in 1960, it will have a military force of 270,000 people, close to the level when Japan launched the "September 18th" Incident in 1931. And the firepower and mobility of the existing army divisions are several times higher than those of the Japanese army before the war. Currently, the Japanese Defense Agency is further expanding its army by enticing a large number of unemployed people to join the military.

According to Japan's current constitution: Japan "shall not maintain war potential" and "forever renounce war," restricting it from large-scale expansion. Therefore, the Japanese ruling clique is trying its best to amend the constitution and implement a conscription system. Before the constitution is amended, it secretly accumulates reserve forces; vigorously supports old military organizations, and takes the "Japan Veterans League," which has more than one million members, as an external organization of the Defense Agency, accepting the guidance of the Defense Agency. According to the second military expansion plan (1961-1965) drafted by the Defense Agency, the regular army will not be expanded on a large scale, but will instead focus on developing reserve forces "to ensure that a large number of troops can be mobilized in the event of an emergency." In order to regularize and legalize the Japanese military structure, the Kishi Nobusuke government, under the pretext that the scale of the Japanese military is increasing and the existing Defense Agency structure is not suitable, has decided to submit a proposal to the Diet to change the Defense Agency to the "Ministry of National Defense," and then change the existing "Self-Defense Forces" to a formal "National Defense Army."

At present, the Kishi Nobusuke government, under the opposition of the Japanese people and pressure from public opinion, does not dare to openly establish nuclear weapons forces, but is actually working in this direction. Japan's defense policy is determined to "modernize its self-defense forces." According to the Defense Agency's plan, the newly established 10th Mixed Brigade of the Army this year will be organized according to the five-unit atomic division system; and it is planned to use this as a blueprint to gradually reorganize all three existing army mixed brigades. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese military will formally establish missile units in 1960-1961 and conduct nuclear armament in 1961-1965. In order to adapt to the needs of atomic warfare, Japan plans to strengthen the organization of the existing "Joint Chiefs of Staff" and establish a unified command structure for the three services.

    Vigorously Developing the Military Industry

After the start of the Korean War, Japanese monopoly capital accepted US "special procurement" orders. In August 1950, the military industry began to resume production and developed rapidly. After the Korean armistice, US military orders decreased; but the Japanese government vigorously supported the military industry in order to promote the militarization of the national economy, so that Japanese military orders increased year by year, and by 1955 exceeded the amount of "special procurement" orders. Japan's military industry has basically returned to pre-war levels, and its output value exceeds that of 1931 (52.2 billion yen in 1957, 35.8 billion yen in 1931). At present, Japan can manufacture jet aircraft, combat warships, various artillery pieces, tanks, and underwater weapons. It is said that by 1960, the Japanese military's existing equipment will be completely domestically produced.

As the foundation of the military industry, Japan's heavy industry has greatly developed after the war. Taking 1957 as an example, Japan manufactured approximately 230 various aircraft, built 2.42 million tons of ships, and produced 310,000 vehicles. These can all be transformed into military industries in wartime.

Japan lags behind major capitalist countries in modern science and technology. In order to catch up with the world level, Japanese monopoly capital began to pay attention to the research of new weapons, mainly missile research, since 1954. Since this year, in order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism and incorporate Japan into the US atomic strategy system, Japanese monopoly capital has been vigorously advocating to equip the military with nuclear weapons; and produce missiles themselves. Recently, they also suggested to the government to set up a "Missile Research and Development Council" in the cabinet and began to reorganize the military industry; attempting to catch up with the world level in about ten years.

According to the "Missile Five-Year Research Plan" (1958-1962) formulated by the Defense Agency's "Air Defense Equipment Committee," Japan will adopt the method of purchasing missile samples from abroad for imitation, and will trial-produce air-to-air (equivalent to the US Sidewinder), surface-to-air (equivalent to the US Nike), and anti-tank (equivalent to the US Long Javelin) missiles in 1959-1960; they will begin to equip troops after 1961, and surface-to-surface missiles will be researched and trial-produced after 1961.

At present, the Defense Agency has established a missile test site on Niijima Island outside Tokyo Bay. On August 1st of this year, the Army established a 400-person missile test team to be responsible for the research and trial production of Nike missiles, and plans to send 40 officers to the US Nike missile training center for training. The Oerlikon missiles purchased by Japan from Switzerland have now arrived in Japan; the Sidewinder missiles that the United States promised to supply are said to have been delivered in the past six months. At the same time, Japan is actively engaged in the development and research of atomic energy under the guise of peaceful use of atomic energy. Japan currently has one boiling water atomic reactor and plans to build twelve atomic reactors of various types by 1967. These are all preparations for the future manufacture of nuclear warheads.

After the war, the vast majority of the Japanese people, who suffered deeply from the scourge of militarism, generally demanded peace and democracy. Progressive Japanese teachers and staff also resisted the textbooks issued by the pre-war Ministry of Education, which instilled militarist ideas, so that Japanese youth received peaceful and democratic education from an early age. According to a survey by the Japanese Psychological Research Institute, more than 80% of Japanese youth hope to eliminate war forever and achieve lasting peace. Even among the Japanese soldiers who were forced to serve in the military, many signed petitions against atomic and hydrogen bomb experiments and were unwilling to accept the task of suppressing the anti-base struggle.

      Restoring Militaristic Education

In order to accelerate the reorganization of armaments, the Japanese government has actively restored militaristic education and has implemented a series of reactionary education systems in recent years. In July 1956, a decision was passed to change the election system of local education committees to an appointment system; and to implement a review system for privately compiled textbooks. In July 1957, it was decided to implement a "work performance evaluation" system for primary and secondary school teachers and staff; attempting to use this to control the political thoughts of school teachers and staff and the entire education undertaking, and to deprive teachers and staff of their freedom and rights. On July 31st of this year, the Ministry of Education announced a draft education plan, stipulating that the current teaching courses in primary and secondary schools should be revised, focusing on so-called "moral education." At present, "respecting the Emperor" and "obeying superiors" are being vigorously promoted in Japan; the militaristic-era "Kimigayo" national anthem is being sung; some dead aggressive and expansionist militarists are being regarded as "national models" and "examples of national morality," making movies, writing novels, and organizing students to watch and read them; at the same time, surviving militarists are invited to schools to give reports.

In the Japanese military, former Defense Agency Director-General Akira Kotaki began to emphasize the "spiritual education" of the military, and the current Director-General Yoshitake Sato has made establishing a "spiritual pillar" in the military the focus of the Defense Agency's work, emphasizing the elimination of soldiers' "employment" views and strengthening education on "defense awareness."

With the revival of militarism, the fascistization of Japan is also gradually strengthening. Secret service chiefs and experts in suppressing labor movements have been brought into the cabinet to carry out cruel suppression of the anti-base movement and the legal struggles of the working class. In May of this year, in Hyakurigahara, Ibaraki Prefecture, farmers who protected their land and opposed the construction of a jet aircraft airport were subjected to the rude interference of the police. In June, the Wakayama Police Headquarters carried out bloody suppression of teachers and staff who opposed the "work performance evaluation" system. Recently, the Japanese government, under the pretext of protecting national secrets, decided to formulate an "Anti-Espionage Law" to further suppress freedom of speech and strengthen fascist rule.

    Participating in the US Strategic System

One of the purposes of the United States' support for Japan after the war was to use Japanese military bases, and Japan also used this to exchange for "US aid." At present, there are more than 400 US bases in Japan. These bases are the main activity places for US troops stationed in the Far East. During the Korean War, they played a significant role in the activities of US military aircraft and warships, and the dispatch, rest, and supply of the army. US newspapers admitted: "The Korean War proved that Japan is an extremely useful strategic location, whether as an advanced supply base for the United Nations forces or as an air force attack base." Today, the United States has transferred a large number of Far East Air Force and Seventh Fleet stationed at bases in Japan to Taiwan, carrying out military provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait.

Japan has participated in the US strategic system by providing bases for the United States. Since the Yoshida Cabinet, it has established a so-called "Japan-US Joint Security System" with the United States. Japan's military expansion plan is also formulated on the premise of relying on US military assistance. When Nobusuke Kishi came to power, he further followed the United States, repeatedly emphasizing "opposing communist neutrality" and that Japan, "as a member of the free camp," should "maintain good relations with the United States." When Nobusuke Kishi visited the United States in June last year, the basic principles of Japanese defense that he personally brought to the United States determined that "the security guarantee system established with the United States" is the "foundation of Japanese defense." Recently, the United States and Japan are conducting talks to revise the "Japan-US Security Treaty," and the purpose is to revise the original treaty to make it more suitable for accelerating the revival of militarism and participating in the US atomic strategy system.

Not only that, but under the instigation of the United States, Japan has also colluded with Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, actively planning to establish a Northeast Asian anti-communist military alliance. In April of this year, when the Turkish Prime Minister visited Japan, he also carried out conspiratorial activities in this regard for the United States. In order to clear the way for Japan to participate in military blocs, the Kishi Nobusuke government even openly proposed a few days ago to abolish the clause in the constitution regarding "not engaging in war," fully exposing the face of Japanese militarism.

        Advocating Foreign Expansion

In Japan, there are still people today who promote the imperialist fallacy that "Japan has a large population and little land, and must expand abroad." The "Blue Book" published by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 1957 shamelessly called the land plundered from Asian countries Japan's "territory," saying that Japan lost 46% of its "territory" after the war.

In June of this year, Renzo Sawada, who served as Japan's chief representative in negotiations with South Korea, publicly clamored that "it is the task of Japanese diplomacy to push the 38th parallel back to the Yalu River." This shows the intention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in claiming to have lost "territory." The Japanese monopoly capital still has ambitions for Taiwan, the territory of our country that was once invaded by Japanese imperialism. They have been sheltering the traitor Liao Wenyi's so-called "Taiwan Independence Alliance" in Japan; and in Taiwan, they are also secretly supporting pro-Japanese elements. These are all preparations for Japan to regain control of Taiwan. Recently, when the Chinese people were fulfilling their sacred duty to liberate Jinmen, Mazu, and the Taiwan and Penghu Islands, it revealed its aggressive nature. Nobusuke Kishi, echoing his American masters, tried his best to say that "the situation in Taiwan is not a civil war, but an international war against communism," attempting to find excuses for their aggression and war plans.

However, Japanese monopoly capital and their mastermind Nobusuke Kishi have not seen clearly that today's world situation is vastly different from that of twenty years ago. The Chinese people have stood up; the anti-colonial struggles of Asian countries have also achieved great victories; socialism has formed a strong world system, and the East wind has completely overwhelmed the West wind. And Japan is no longer the Japan of the Tojo era. The awareness of the Japanese people who have suffered from the disaster of war has greatly increased. They firmly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following the United States' aggression and demand the establishment of friendly relations with Asian countries. At present, the peace movement in Japan is developing widely and deeply, and the struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism is also increasingly strengthening. If the Kishi Nobusuke government is determined to follow the path of militarism and imperialism, it will inevitably be met with fierce opposition from the people of Asia and Japan.

    岸信介政府积极复活军国主义
    柳初
    日本在战后虽然失掉了殖民地，处于被占领国的地位，原有军国主义的战争机器遭到了一定程度的摧毁。但是，日本的垄断资本，由于美国企图利用日本做为它在远东的侵略工具而被保留下来；并且在为美国侵略政策服务的过程中，得到了进一步的发展。
    朝鲜战争期间，日本垄断资本依靠美国的军事订货，大发横财，刺激了国内生产的发展。日本的工业生产指数于1951年很快超过了战前的水平，1953年达到战前的一点六倍。朝鲜停战后，美国的军事订货有所减少，但垄断资本残酷地榨取工人农民的血汗，扩大设备投资，发展出口贸易，生产继续上升。工业生产指数最高在1957年曾达到战前的二点七倍。
    生产的发展，促使垄断资本必须争夺市场，为它的产品输出和资本输出寻找出路。这样，日本垄断资本就重温起军国主义的旧梦；力图东山再起，重新称霸远东。战后日本历届内阁为复活军国主义曾做了一系列的准备；而以代表垄断资本利益的岸信介，在这方面最为积极。
        积极重整军备
    日本自1950年起开始重新武装以来，到目前已建立起一支相当规模的军队，共约二十四万人；远远超过希特勒上台前德国的武装力量（当时德国兵力仅十万人）。根据日本防卫厅目前执行的三年扩军计划，到1960年计划完成时，拥有兵力将达二十七万人，接近1931年日本发动“九·一八”事变时的水平。而现有陆军师的火力和机动力，都相当于战前日军的好几倍。目前，日本防卫厅正以引诱大批失业者参军的办法，使军队得到进一步扩充。
    按日本现行宪法的规定：日本“不得保有战力”，“永远放弃战争”，限制它不能大规模地扩充。因此日本统治集团正极力企图修改宪法，实行征兵制。在宪法未改之前，暗地蓄积后备兵力；大力扶植旧军人组织，把拥有一百多万会员的“日本乡友同盟”做为防卫厅的外围组织，接受防卫厅的指导。按防卫厅草拟的第二个扩军计划（1961年——1965年），正规的陆军将不作大量扩充，转为大力发展后备队，“来保证一旦有事时，即可动员大量兵力”。为了使日军机构正规和合法，岸信介政府借口日军规模日益扩大，现有防卫厅机构不合需要；决定向国会会议提出将防卫厅改为“国防省”，下一步再将现有的“自卫队”改为正式的“国防军”。
    目前岸信介政府在日本人民的反对和舆论压力下，虽不敢公开建立核武器部队，但实际上正在朝这个方向努力。日本的国防政策就确定要“使自卫力量现代化”。根据防卫厅的计划，今年新成立的陆军第十混成旅，就将按五单位制原子师的编制组成；并计划以此为蓝本，陆续将已有的三个陆军混成旅全部改编。据日本报纸透露：日军将于1960年—1961年正式成立导弹部队，1961年—1965年进行核武装。为了适应原子战争的需要，日本计划加强现有“参谋长联席会议”的组织，建立起三军的统一指挥机构。
    大力发展军事工业
    朝鲜战争开始后，日本垄断资本接受了美国的“特需”订货，1950年8月，军事工业即开始恢复生产，并且得到迅速发展。朝鲜停战后，美军订货减少；但日本政府为了促使国民经济军事化，大力扶植军事工业，使日军的订货逐年增加，到1955年就超过了“特需”订货的数额。日本军事工业现已基本上恢复到战前水平，它的产值超过了1931年（1957年为五百二十二亿日元，1931年为三百五十八亿日元）。目前，日本已能制造喷气飞机、作战舰艇、各种火炮、坦克及水下武器等。据说到1960年，日军现有的装备将可以完全国产化。
    日本的重工业由于做为军事工业的基础，战后有了很大的发展，以1957年为例。日本制造了各种飞机约二百三十架，造船二百四十二万吨，车辆三十一万辆。这些都可在战时，一变而为军事工业。
    日本在现代科学技术方面，落在主要资本主义国家的后面，为了赶上世界水平，日本垄断资本自1954年就以研究导弹为主开始注意新武器的研究。今年以来，日本的垄断资本为了加紧复活日本军国主义，将日本纳入美国的原子战略体系，更竭力鼓吹要以核武器装备军队；自行生产导弹。最近，他们又向政府建议，在内阁中设置“研究发展导弹审议会”，并着手改组军事工业；企图在十年左右的时间内，赶上世界水平。
    据防卫厅“防空装备委员会”拟定的“导弹五年研究计划”（1958年—1962年）透露，日本将采取向国外购置导弹样品进行仿制的办法，在1959年—1960年试制成功空对空（相当于美国的响尾蛇）、地对空（相当于美国的奈克）、反坦克（相当于美国的长标枪）导弹；1961年以后开始装备部队，地对地导弹则在1961年以后研究试制。
    目前，防卫厅已在东京湾外的新岛建立导弹试验场。今年8月1日，陆军成立了一个四百人的导弹试验队，负责研究和试制奈克式导弹，并计划派遣四十名军官去美国的奈克导弹训练中心受训。日本向瑞士购买的厄利康导弹现已运抵日本；美国答应供给的响尾蛇导弹，据传在过去的六个月中也已交货。同时，日本在和平利用原子能的掩饰下，正在积极从事原子能的开发和研究。日本现有沸水型原子反应堆一座，计划到1967年建成各种原子反应堆十二座。这些都是为将来制造核弹头所做的准备。
    战后，深受军国主义祸害的日本广大人民普遍要求和平民主，日本进步的教职员工也纷纷抵制战前文部省颁发的灌输军国主义思想的教材，使日本青年从小受到和平民主的教。育据日本心理研究所的调查，日本青年中有80％以上的人希望永远消灭战争，实现持久和平。就是在被迫当兵的日军士兵中也有不少人签名反对原子弹、氢弹实验，不愿接受镇压反基地斗争的差事。
      恢复军国主义教育
    日本政府为了加速重整军备，积极恢复军国主义教育，近年来连续实行了一系列的反动教育制度。1956年7月通过决定：将地方教育委员会的选举制改为任命制；对民编教科书实行审查制度。1957年7月又决定对中小学教职员实行“勤务评定”制度；企图借此控制学校教职员的政治思想和整个教育事业，剥夺教职员的自由权利。今年7月31日文部省又公布了一个教育计划草案，规定修改中小学的现行教学课程，着重进行所谓“道德教育”。目前在日本国内大肆宣扬“尊敬天皇”、“服从长上”；唱军国主义时代的“君之代”国歌；把一些已死的侵略成性、鼓吹扩张的军国主义分子，当做“民族的典范”、“国民道德的榜样”，拍制电影，写成小说，组织学生观看和阅读；同时邀请还活着的军国主义分子到学校做报告。
    在日军中，前任防卫厅长官小泷彬就开始强调军队的“精神教育”，现任长官左藤义诠更以在军队中竖立起“精神支柱”做为防卫厅工作的重点，强调消除士兵的“雇佣”观点和加强“防卫意识”的教育。
    随着军国主义的复活，日本国内的法西斯化也在逐步加强。特务头子和镇压劳工运动的能手已被拉入内阁，对反基地运动和工人阶级的合法斗争进行残酷镇压。今年5月间，在茨城县百里原，保护自己的土地、反对修建喷气飞机机场的农民遭到了警察的蛮横干涉。6月间，和歌山警察本部对反对“勤务评定”制度的教职员进行了血腥的镇压。最近，日本政府更借口保护国家机密，决定制订“防谍法”，进一步箝制自由言论和加强法西斯统治。
    参加美国的战略体系
    战后美国扶植日本的目的之一，是要利用日本的军事基地，日本亦以此来换取“美援”。目前，美国在日本的基地共有四百多处。这些基地就是美国驻远东部队的主要活动场所。它们在朝鲜战争期间，对美军飞机、舰艇的活动和陆军的调遣、休整与补给，起了很大的作用。美国报纸承认：“朝鲜战争证明：日本无论做为联合国军的前进补给基地，或做为空军的攻击基地，都是极其有用的战略要地”。现今，美国又把驻在日本基地上的远东空军和第七舰队大批调往台湾，在台湾海峡对我国进行军事挑衅。
    日本通过为美国提供基地，参加了美国的战略体系。从吉田内阁起，就同美国建立了所谓“日美共同安全体制”。日本的扩军计划也是以依靠美军援助为前提而制订的。岸信介上台，进一步追随美国，再三强调“反对容共中立主义”，日本“做为自由阵营的一员”，要“与美国搞好关系”。去年6月，岸信介访美时，亲自携往美国的日本国防基本方针，就确定了“与美国建立的安全保障体制”是“日本防卫的基础”。最近美日双方正在进行修改“日美安全条约”的会谈，目的也是把原条约修改得更适合于加速复活军国主义和参加美国的原子战略体系。
    不仅如此，日本在美国的指使下，还勾结蒋介石、李承晚，积极策划建立东北亚反共军事同盟。今年4月，土耳其总理访日时，也为美国在这方面进行过阴谋活动。为了替日本参加军事集团扫清道路，岸信介政府前几天甚至公然提出要取消宪法中关于“不得进行战争”的条款，充分暴露了日本军国主义的面目。
        鼓吹对外扩张
    在日本，到今天还有人宣扬“日本人口多、国土少，必须向外扩张”的帝国主义滥调。日本外务省1957年9月发表的“蓝皮书”中，无耻地把掠夺亚洲国家的土地称为日本的“国土”，说日本在战后失掉了“国土”的46％。
    今年6月，做为日本的首席代表与南朝鲜进行谈判的泽田廉三公开叫嚷“把三八线推回到鸭绿江边，是日本外交的任务”。这就表明了外务省所谓失掉了“国土”的用意何在。对一度被日本帝国主义侵略的我国的领土台湾，日本垄断资本仍然野心未死。他们在日本一直庇护着汉奸廖文毅建立的所谓“台湾独立同盟”；在台湾，也暗中扶植亲日分子。这都是为日本重新染指台湾进行准备。最近，当中国人民履行自己的神圣职责，解放金门、马祖和台湾、澎湖列岛时，它就露出了自己的侵略本色。岸信介同他的美国主子一唱一和，极力说“台湾的局势不是内战，而是一场反对共产主义的国际战争”，企图为他们的侵略和战争计划找借口。
    但是，日本垄断资本和他们的主谋人岸信介没有看清楚，今天的世界局势已大大不同于二十年前了。中国人民已经站起来了；亚洲国家反殖民主义的斗争也取得了很大的胜利；社会主义已经形成一个强大的世界体系，东风完全压倒了西风。而日本也已经不是东条时代的日本，遭受了战争灾害的日本人民的觉悟大大地提高了，他们坚决反对岸信介政府追随美国的侵略政策，要求与亚洲国家建立友好关系。目前日本国内的和平运动正在广泛而深入的开展，反对复活日本军国主义的斗争也正在日益加强。岸信介政府如果决心走军国主义和帝国主义的道路，就必将在亚洲和日本人民面前碰得头破血流。
