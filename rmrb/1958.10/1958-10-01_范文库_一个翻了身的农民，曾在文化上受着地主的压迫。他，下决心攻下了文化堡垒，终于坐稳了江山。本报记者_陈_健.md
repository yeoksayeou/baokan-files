    Fan Wenku
    A peasant who turned the tables, once oppressed culturally by the landlords. He was determined to conquer the cultural fortress and finally secured his position.
    By our reporter Chen Jian
    After crossing several hills, I arrived at Mogou Village in Dengfeng, Henan. Fan Daku wasn't in the village. An old man pointed the way, saying, "Are you looking for our Daku? Oh! He's been transferred to the township as the accounting network chief!" This was my third visit to Mogou Village. When I came last December, Fan Daku was a village accountant. When I came this March, he entered the agricultural technology night school and was elected a model worker. This time, he became the accounting network chief. Nearby, if any production team (formerly agricultural cooperative) had problems with their accounts, Daku would arrive and straighten out years of confused records, down to the last penny. This isn't all of Fan Daku's knowledge. He's also well-versed in classic Chinese novels like "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," and "Stories Old and New." During the Great Leap Forward, he wrote hundreds of quick-verse poems. He likes philosophy and can understand Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," often carrying these two books with him for self-study. Mathematics and accounting work have also fascinated him. This young man wants to learn everything. He subscribes to several magazines and newspapers and often writes articles. Reading has become a habit for him. He says, "It's like wearing clothes and eating. If I don't touch a book for a day, I feel like I'm missing something."

        The Gun and the Pen
    That evening, I asked Fan Daku to talk in detail about his journey of learning culture. The young man gradually fell into painful memories... Before liberation, Mogou Village was a poor mountain village where "people didn't go and birds didn't fly." The masses lacked food and clothing. Of the entire village, only the two landlord families had literate people. At that time, the landlord could present a blank sheet of paper and claim it was official business, demanding money from each household. After liberation, Fan Daku became the village accountant, but because he was illiterate, the real power remained in the hands of the landlord. He told me: "In 1951, when paying the public grain, I calculated all night but couldn't figure out the total amount delivered by the village. When the team sending the grain set off at dawn, I was so anxious I stamped my feet in the house. Helpless, I bought three packs of cigarettes and asked the landlord for help. The landlord grinned, carrying the abacus ahead of me, and I followed behind, my eyes burning with hatred. That's not all. He deliberately messed up the financial and grain accounts, saying that village chief Fan Hailiang had embezzled sixty-eight catties of wheat, cleverly using a meeting to incite the masses to struggle against Fan Hailiang and me. During the struggle, Fan Hailiang kept staring at me. I knew he hoped I would stand up immediately and clarify the account on the spot, but he didn't know that I was also confused! Later, I stood up to speak, but couldn't explain clearly. The landlord said from the side, 'Accountant Fan, aren't you an accountant? Can't you calculate? The account is clear, just sixty-eight catties short.' At that time, the masses weren't very aware, and after the landlord said this, they surrounded Fan Hailiang and me, talking all at once and pushing and shoving. Fan Hailiang stood with his chest out, saying, 'Folks! I have a clear conscience.' The landlord slowly said from the side, 'Village chief, conscience can't replace grain...' "
    "After the meeting, Hailiang and I hid in a room and cried bitterly. I had followed my parents begging for food since I was a child. I didn't even shed a tear when my mother was forced to sell me to another village, but that night, I felt very sad. I said, 'Hailiang, the landlords have exploited us for generations. Now we've been allocated land and turned the tables, but they're using culture to oppress us again. Don't you see, we can't secure this victory if we only have the gun and don't hold the pen!' I wiped away my tears, clenched my fist, and slammed it on the table. 'Hailiang, we must study culture! If we don't dig out this last root of exploitation, we poor people won't have completely turned the tables. Now the world is ours, and we can't be considered liberated if we don't conquer the "illiteracy mountain."'"

          Eight Years as One Day
    The son of a middle peasant family in this village, Ren Yucan, had been teaching in a primary school in another county and had returned to the village. The village immediately formed a cultural study group for village cadres. Fan Daku was the first to sign up. He looked at the black characters in the book, like a hungry tiger seeing food, wishing he could swallow them in one gulp. During the day, he labored and worked. The night became his world of learning. In the freezing winter, he spent the night studying and writing by the light of a bean oil lamp, often falling asleep on the table just before dawn. The earliest-rising grandmother, seeing the light in her grandson's small room, would quietly push open the door and come in, helplessly blow out the light, close the book, pull the quilt from the bed and put it over Daku, then sigh and leave. The family had been without salt for several months, as Daku had taken the money for salt to buy paper and lamp oil. Once, the grandmother made a suggestion, and Daku said excitedly, "Grandma, is eating salt more important than completely defeating the landlord? Don't you know, it's not enough just to have land, we also need to master culture. Otherwise, the landlords will oppress us in other ways." The grandmother looked at her grandson with sympathy and never mentioned buying salt again. On hot summer nights, when others couldn't sleep because of the heat and mosquitoes, he would hide in the small room in the middle of the night to read and write. When he felt dizzy or sleepy, he would go to the well and pour a bucket of cold water over his head, or pull his ears, twist his nose, and when he was awake, continue to learn. This person, who was not afraid of any difficulties or obstacles in his studies, was named a county anti-illiteracy model five times. For eight years, day after day, except for official business, he never missed a culture class. Fan Daku conquered "Illiteracy Mountain" with such amazing perseverance and tenacity, becoming the first person in the village and township to escape illiteracy.

          The Pride of the Township
    By the second half of 1952, Fan Daku was already an outstanding accountant and clerk in the village. Among the poor peasants here, for the first time in generations, a literate person appeared. Everyone felt an unspeakable joy and pride. In the past, to ask the landlord to write a letter or open a note, you had to bring cigarettes and pastries and still be afraid to ask what was written. Now Daku was their own intellectual, writing whenever they needed him. The masses surrounded Daku, watching him write and record with a rustle, like flowing water, and use the abacus as easily as eating fried soybeans. They were amazed, envious, and proud. Most importantly, with Daku, everyone was at ease when handling official business. When Daku returned from a meeting in the township, he would take out his notebook and read and convey the information in detail, and the masses knew that this was the instruction from above. When paying the public grain, they would just put the wheat bags on the field and leave, and Daku would say, "Give me a receipt." The masses would say, "Why do we need a receipt from our own accountant?" As for Fan Daku? He felt like he had unloaded a thousand catties of weight and also relieved the masses of ten thousand years of oppression. But he wasn't proud or complacent. He was a model cadre in the township, an agricultural labor model, and the first-class labor force in the village.

    范文库
    一个翻了身的农民，曾在文化上受着地主的压迫。他，下决心攻下了文化堡垒，终于坐稳了江山。
    本报记者　陈健
    翻过几个山头，来到了河南登封磨沟村。范大库不在村，一位老人指点说：“你找俺大库吗？哟！调到乡里当会计网长啦！”我到磨沟村这是第三次。去年12月来时，范大库是一个村里的会计；今年3月来时，他进了农业技术夜校，当选了劳动模范；这一次来，他当了会计网长。附近，不管是哪个生产队（过去的农业社）的账目有问题，大库一到就把几年的糊涂账清理的头头是道，分文不差。这一些，并不是范大库的全部学问，他还熟读了中国古典小说“水浒”、“西游记”、“今古奇观”等；大跃进中，写了上百首快板诗歌，他喜欢哲学，能理解毛主席的“矛盾论”、“实践论”，还经常把这两本书带在身边自修。数学和会计工作也使他着了迷。这年青小伙子，样样东西都想学，他订了好几种杂志和报纸，还经常写点稿子。读书成了他的习惯，他说：“就像穿衣吃饭一样，一天不摸书，就觉着少点啥。”
        刀把子和笔杆子
    就在这天晚上，我要求范大库详细地谈谈他学习文化的经过，这青年人渐渐陷入了痛苦的回忆里……。解放前，磨沟村是“人不走，鸟不飞”的穷山沟。群众没吃没穿。全村两家地主，只有两家有识字的人。那时，地主拿着一张白纸说是公事，就可以挨户要钱。解放后，范大库当了村会计，因为目不识丁，实权仍在地主手里。他告诉我：在1951年缴公粮时，我算了整夜没有把全村送交的公粮数目计算出来。天亮时，送公粮的大队出发了，我急的在屋里跺脚，没法，买了三包香烟去请地主，地主笑的呲着牙拿着算盘走在我前面，我跟后头，恨的两眼冒火星子。这还不算，他故意弄乱财粮账目，说村长范海亮贪污六十八斤小麦，巧妙地利用一次大会，煽动群众斗范海亮和我。在斗争时，范海亮老是用眼睛盯着我。我知道，他希望我马上站起来当场把这笔账说清，他不知道我心里也是一笔糊涂账啊！后来我站起来说话了，没有说清，地主在一边说：“范会计，你是会计难道不会算账吗？这账一清二白，就是少了六十八斤粮。”那时群众觉悟不高，让地主这么一说，七嘴八舌，动手动脚地围上我和范海亮。范海亮挺着胸膛说：“乡亲们！我凭良心。”地主慢腾腾在一边说：“村长，良心不能代替粮食……。”
    开完会，我和海亮躲到一间屋子里痛哭起来。我从小跟着爹娘逃荒要饭，俺娘逼的卖给外乡，我都没有掉过一滴眼泪，这晚，不知为啥，心里很难受。我说：“海亮，地主剥削咱几辈子，现在分了土地翻身了，他又拿文化压迫咱，你看清没有，光有了刀把子，握不住笔杆子，这家也当不稳啊！”我把眼泪一擦，握紧拳头，往桌子上一击，“海亮，学习文化！不把这最后的剥削根子挖掉，咱穷人还不算彻底翻身。现在天下是咱们的，不攻倒‘文盲山’算不了翻身汉。”
          八年如一日
    这个村一家中农的儿子任玉灿一直在外县教小学，这时回村来了。村里马上成立了村干部文化学习小组。范大库第一个报了名，他看看书本上的黑字，像饿虎看见食物，恨不得一口吞下。白天他劳动工作，夜晚成了他学习的世界。在冰天雪地的严冬里，他成夜伴着豆油灯看书、写字，经常是快天亮时，伏在桌子上睡着了。最早醒来的老祖母，看见孙子的小屋里有亮，便悄悄地推开门进来，无可奈何地吹了灯，合上书本，拉过床上的棉被给大库披上，然后，叹了口气出去了。家中已经断盐好几个月了，盐钱都被大库拿去买了纸张和点灯油。有一次老祖母提了意见，大库激动地说：“奶奶，吃盐能比彻底打垮地主还重要吗？你知道不知道，光有土地还不行，还要掌握文化，不然，地主还会用别的方法压迫咱。”奶奶同情地望望孙子，以后再不提买盐的事了。在炎热的夏夜，别人因为热和蚊子咬而睡不着觉的时候，他却成半夜的躲在小屋里看书写字，头昏或者瞌睡时，就到井边打一桶凉水泼在头上，或拉拉耳朵，拧拧鼻子，清醒了，再继续学下去。这个在学习上不畏一切艰难阻碍的人，五次被评为县的扫盲模范。八年如一日的艰苦学习，除因公事外，从没有缺过一堂文化课。范大库就以这样惊人的毅力和韧性攻下了“文盲山”，成为 全村全乡第一个摆脱文盲的人。
          全乡的骄傲
    1952年下半年，范大库已经是村里出色的会计和文书了。在这里的贫苦农民中，几辈子以来第一次出现了有文化的人，人人都感到说不出来的痛快和骄傲。过去找地主写封信，开个条子要拿着纸烟和点心，还不敢问写的啥字；现在大库是自己的知识分子，什么时候去什么时候写。群众围着大库，看他刷刷地写，刷刷地记，像流水，打起算盘像吃炒盐豆那么容易，又惊讶，又羡慕，又骄傲。最重要的是有了大库，办起公事，大伙放心了。大库从乡里开会回来，掏出小本子，详细地念着传达着，群众知道这是上级的指示。缴公粮时，把麦布袋往场上一放就走了，大库说：“给个收到条”。群众说：“自己的会计要啥收到条？”范大库呢？感觉自己卸下了千斤重负，也替群众卸下了万年的重压。可是，他一点没有骄傲自满，他是乡里的模范干部，农业劳动模范，村上第一流的劳动力。
