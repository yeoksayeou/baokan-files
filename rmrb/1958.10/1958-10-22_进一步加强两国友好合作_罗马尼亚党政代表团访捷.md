Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 20th - A Romanian Party and Government delegation, led by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, arrived in Prague this morning for a visit at the invitation of the Czechoslovakian government. The delegation includes Chivu Stoica, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Peter Borila, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

During its visit to Czechoslovakia, the delegation will hold talks with the leaders of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government to exchange views on the most important issues of concern to both countries. The Romanian guests will also visit factories, agricultural cooperatives and other enterprises.

Welcoming the delegation at the Prague railway station were Czechoslovak Communist Party and state leaders Novotny, Široký and others.

In his welcoming speech, President Novotny expressed his belief that the visit of the Romanian Party and Government delegation would help further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between Czechoslovakia and Romania, and further prove the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his reply, Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized the unbreakable friendship between the two peoples and spoke of the significance of fraternal mutual assistance between the countries of the socialist camp.

The delegation was greeted by the citizens of Prague lining the streets as they drove through the city to their residence.

This morning, President Novotny and Prime Minister Široký met with the Romanian Party and Government delegation. The hosts and guests had a warm conversation.

In the afternoon, the Party and Government delegations of the two countries began talks.

Czechoslovak newspapers all published editorials yesterday welcoming the delegation. "Red Right" emphasized in its editorial that all our common interests and goals have the revolutionary Marxist doctrine as their firm ideological foundation. As long as the dangerous enemies of Marxist doctrine appear clearly, as long as the revisionist wave that helps the imperialists carry out sinful attacks on the Soviet Union and all socialist countries is making trouble, the parties of both countries will firmly stand up to safeguard the revolutionary Marxist doctrine.
