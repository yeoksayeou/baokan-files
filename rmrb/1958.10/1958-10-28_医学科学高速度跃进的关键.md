The socialist and communist consciousness of intellectuals has been unprecedentedly raised since the rectification movement last year. After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party formulated the General Line, under its glorious light, the comrades of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, with incomparable excitement and soaring enthusiasm, launched a high tide of technological revolution. In the past three months, the number of inventions and technical innovations in various research units has reached thousands. Major achievements have been made in conquering the most serious diseases endangering people's health, such as tumors, cardiovascular system diseases, hematopoietic system diseases, epidemics, parasitic diseases, and nervous system diseases. Some are world firsts, and some have shown very gratifying signs. According to the current situation, due to the establishment of the Party's leadership over medical science, we can predict without exaggeration that in three to five years, Chinese medicine will make great contributions to the world's medical science in many aspects, providing new guarantees for the health of the working people.

The Two Roads in the Field of Medical Science
Struggle is Still the Main Contradiction

The technological revolution movement has had a good start and achieved great results. This is a victory in the struggle against the capitalist road, but it has not achieved complete victory. This is because many bourgeois intellectuals, especially bourgeois experts, still adhere to bourgeois medical academic thought and bourgeois medical traditions. They do not see that dialectical materialism is the driving force for the advancement of science and technology, and that the Party's leadership over science and technology is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of China's medical science. Therefore, the struggle between the two roads in the field of medical science is still the main contradiction at present. Many bourgeois experts believe that medical science is a struggle against diseases. Therefore, as far as medical science is concerned, it cannot have class character, and there is no question of two roads. This supra-class, supra-political view is incompatible with the policy of "medical science serving production, serving the enhancement of people's health, combining research with practice, combining Western medicine with traditional Chinese medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, and emphasizing both prevention and treatment." Therefore, further analyzing and criticizing bourgeois medical academic thought, breaking down bourgeois traditions and old habits, and firmly establishing the Party's leadership over medical science, putting medical science research, medical work, and cadre training on the track of the general line of socialist construction has become an urgent task for our medical science workers.

Everything for enhancing people's health and ensuring the great leap forward in industry and agriculture is the premise and starting point of medical science work. We advocate combining theory with practice, and research work should serve the enhancement of people's health and production. Predecessors have accumulated rich experience through practice and generalized and improved it into theory. We should combine it with practice and apply it, and accumulate new experience through practice, and then generalize and improve it. This is the law of the development of science. However, some bourgeois experts, after having a certain theoretical and practical foundation, despise practice, are obsessed with reading literature, bury themselves in test tubes and laboratories, delve into trivialities, and write papers that are divorced from reality to seek fame and fortune. Some people, although they have not separated from the actual situation of patients, are not interested in the diseases that pose the greatest threat to the health of the broad masses of working people, and are not interested in a series of new problems that have emerged in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. For example, the problem of burns after the national steelmaking campaign, the problem of labor protection and occupational diseases after the national industrialization campaign, and the problem of environmental sanitation after the establishment of people's communes all need to be solved urgently, but some people are not interested in these major issues, but are keen on the study of rare diseases. For example, mosquito experts do not study how to eliminate mosquitoes more quickly and thoroughly in the elimination of the four pests, but are still tirelessly studying mosquito classification and searching for new mosquito species. Doesn't this fully illustrate that bourgeois experts are adhering to the capitalist road of serving personal fame and fortune? In medical work, we advocate everything facing patients, serving patients, and carrying out prevention work based on hospitals, while bourgeois experts advocate that patients serve research, serve to improve personal skills, and hospitals are separated from prevention and the masses. Under the guidance of this thought, there are still many rules and regulations in hospitals that are detrimental to patients, and there is a widespread idea and style among doctors that attaches importance to inpatient wards and neglects outpatient clinics, attaches importance to research and neglects treatment, attaches importance to medical treatment and neglects prevention, and treats diseases without treating people, which is extremely harmful to patients. There are even heinous acts of treating patients as research materials regardless of their lives. Therefore, developing the communist style and breaking down bourgeois traditions are important links in the technological revolution.

Bourgeois medical traditions are manifested in the rules and regulations of professional work, and also in intangible habitual forces. The development of science requires detailed division of labor, which is undeniable. Due to different divisions of labor, a certain job title is also completely necessary. But the essence of the problem is that the scientific division of labor and job titles are used by the bourgeoisie as a means of rule, hindering the development of science. This division of labor is not division of labor and cooperation, but "division" and "monopoly." The higher the position, the more detached from the masses, one level oppressing another, without technical democracy, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates is that of "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law." This hierarchy is essentially different from scientific division of labor. In research work, there are not only confidentiality and patent habits, but also professors have the tradition of monopoly and exclusive occupation. Lower-level technicians work blindly, and if there is any achievement, it is published with the professor's name. All this is to make patients serve research and subordinates serve experts, stifling new forces and causing a trend of stagnation in science and technology. Although many reforms have been carried out since liberation, these bourgeois traditions and habitual forces left over from the old society have not been fundamentally eliminated. It should be said that its ideological source is bourgeois right ideology, and bourgeois medical authority is its concentrated manifestation.

Under the leadership of the Party, the Department of Neurology of Beijing Xiehe Hospital, closely relying on the masses, fundamentally broke down bourgeois traditions, broke through old habitual forces, and changed the phenomenon that senior technicians were detached from the actual situation of patients in the past; cultivated all-rounders, combined research with medical treatment, and combined traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine; implemented technical democracy and comprehensive collaboration; and initially established a model of proletarian hospital management, restoring the reputation of "guerrilla habits" and "rural style." Therefore, they recently saved two patients who were previously considered "certain to die."

Relying on the Masses, All People Participating, and Carrying Out the Technological Revolution of Medical Science in a More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Way

Is the technological revolution in medical science carried out by relying on the masses, with all people participating, in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, or is it carried out by relying on a few experts, step by step, in a cold and quiet, less, slower, worse, and more expensive way? This is a question that has not been resolved in the past, and it is also a divergence in research methods between us and bourgeois experts. Bourgeois experts believe that only experts are the smartest and most talented. If the masses are mobilized to conduct scientific research, the scientific level will be reduced and things will be messed up. Facts have proved that they are wrong. In the technological revolution, most of the inventions and creations were made by the masses, and they did a very good job. For example, many creative studies such as tumor immunity, acupuncture treatment of subacute radiation sickness, and egg sterilization are not only of great practical significance, but also of great theoretical value. And these were done by young people. If the broad masses of technicians are mobilized to go deep into factories, mines, rural areas, forests, and streets, they will not only solve the practical problems of the broad masses of people, but also collect extremely rich materials and discover new problems that were not found in past books, and find new methods for preventing and treating diseases. Isn't this accelerating the development of medical science even more? Aren't those who are just sitting in their small laboratories facing test tubes and literature and imagining in a way that is divorced from reality appear very pitiful and small? Facts have proved that only by using the method of mass movement to develop medical science can the infinite wisdom and rich practical experience of the masses be tapped, can continuous revolution and continuous leaps forward be achieved, and can the process of the technological revolution movement advance from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level, and continuously.

In the mass movement, where should experts place themselves? This is also a question. Our country has always attached great importance to and cherished experts, but since the technological revolution is a mass movement, it must first be clear that experts are also members of the masses. Therefore, they must actively participate in the technological revolution movement, and must not suppress new forces and become stumbling blocks to the technological revolution, nor can they stand outside the movement and watch from the sidelines. At present, some experts adhere to their bourgeois academic thoughts, views, and methods. Not only can they not advance with the masses, but they point fingers from behind, and even adopt an attitude of sarcasm and sabotage. Some are in the midst of intense self-struggle, with nostalgia for the old and hope for the new, but still have doubts, sometimes advancing with the masses, and sometimes standing aside as onlookers, with many concerns and unable to make up their minds. Of course, there are also some experts who have basically criticized their bourgeois academic thoughts, broken down bourgeois traditions, believe in the power of the masses, rely on the leadership of the Party, are full of vigor, and dare to think and dare to do. Since experts all come from the old society and have been educated by the bourgeoisie for a long time, although they have made great progress under the education of the Party in the past few years, the thoughts and feelings of the exploiting classes and the academic thoughts of the bourgeoisie have not been fundamentally and thoroughly resolved. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out further self-transformation in the great crucible of this technological revolution, with the help of the masses. The Party will also make every effort to win over and help them actively participate in this great revolutionary movement, believing that most experts are willing to transform themselves well. Recently, Professor Feng Lanzhou conducted self-criticism. Although there are still some shortcomings, the attitude is good, which creates conditions for self-transformation. Only in this way can they make useful contributions to the people, and can they be valued by the Party and the people.

Combining Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Using Both Indigenous and Foreign Methods,
Creating Our Unique New Medicine

Learning from traditional Chinese medicine, combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and using both indigenous and foreign methods are the decisive factors in the technological revolution. Traditional Chinese medicine has many advantages that Western medicine does not have, both in the practice of preventing and treating diseases and in theory. This has been proven many times. These valuable experiences were buried for a long time due to the limitations of social and historical conditions. After liberation, they were discovered due to the correct leadership of the Party, and they radiated great light. However, in carrying out this work, there has been great resistance in the past few years. Among medical and health technicians, especially some bourgeois experts, believe that traditional Chinese medicine is "unscientific" and say that the effect of traditional Chinese medicine is an "accidental phenomenon." This can only be explained by the serious harm of bourgeois academic thought to medical science and the Jia Gui-style slave mentality. Our Party firmly advocates combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, taking the essence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and discarding the dross of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, to achieve the confluence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine and create our unique new medicine. This is the only correct policy for the leap forward of medical science in our country. This policy has extremely important significance for the medical and health cause in our country.

Overall planning, organizing large-scale collaboration is an important organizational measure for the technological revolution. Any work is carried out under the leadership of the Party in an organized and planned manner. This is the law of socialist construction. Some people oppose the planned development of scientific research. They believe that scientific research is an unknown number, and it is impossible to have a plan, and that the plan will also bind "genius" and "inspiration." We believe that this understanding is wrong. Planning not only puts forward the requirements of the state and clarifies our goals, so that research work can be closely combined with the current needs of production and the health needs of the people, but also can better organize forces, use forces, and can also encourage people's enthusiasm and creativity, and can also limit the rampant bourgeois thought and limit the research that is divorced from the tasks of the state and aims at the pursuit of personal fame and fortune. In comprehensive research, it is necessary to take the special topic as the center, disrupt the boundaries of institutes, hospitals, departments, and offices, and also carry out large-scale collaboration inside and outside, up and down, to overcome departmentalism and individualism, and strive for a common goal. Only in this way can we help each other, learn from each other's strengths, make up for each other's weaknesses, promote each other, develop together, and improve together.

Breaking Bourgeois Medical Authority
Establishing the Proletarian Ambition for Health

If the above-mentioned issues are the key issues in the technological revolution, then the absolute leadership of the Party over medical science is the key to the key. Whether the Party can lead science, whether the Party should lead professional work, we have been carrying out sharp struggles with bourgeois experts since liberation, which is also a fundamental struggle. After ideological transformation, they admitted that "the Party committee leads the direction and policies, political and ideological work," but said that "experts should lead professional work." Before the rectification, they also proposed that "laymen cannot lead experts," which in fact was to insist on "expert dictatorship." These bourgeois experts not only used technical knowledge as capital to bargain with the Party, refused the Party's leadership, resisted the Party's policies in professional technology, and passively resisted and sabotaged the tasks assigned by the state; but also used a set of bourgeois tactics to occupy territory and cultivate their own "authority" in their work. They not only suppressed and attacked new forces, but also spread bourgeois poison to young people. Among some young people, there are still different doubts about the Party's direct leadership of professional work. Therefore, they still do not obey the leadership of the Party in professional work, but obey the leadership of experts. This fully shows that the Party's leadership over professional work has not been firmly established. After the rectification and the anti-Rightist movement, the situation has changed greatly, but this problem has not been completely resolved. We believe that in any society, science must serve politics, so politics must lead professional work. Let's look at the issue of experts and laymen from a political perspective. The Party is not a layman in building socialism and communism, but an expert, because the Party knows how to make medical science serve the people; bourgeois experts do not understand this, so they are the real laymen. It is now very clear that the Party is not only a real expert in the leadership of the development path, direction, and policies of science, but also leads science very well in scientific business due to putting politics in command, following the mass line, and carrying out technical democracy. Bourgeois experts not only do not understand Marxism-Leninism, but are full of idealism and metaphysical views, full of bourgeois individualism, and everything starts from "I." Therefore, they cannot guide science in the right direction. The facts before and after the technological revolution fully illustrate this problem. Faced with the facts, some bourgeois experts have "admitted defeat," not only willing to obey the leadership of the Party politically, but also willing to obey the leadership of the Party professionally. But not all bourgeois experts are like this, so our current task is to effectively lead the professional work, to break down bourgeois medical authority, and to establish the proletarian ambition for health. Use the facts to educate those who are still wavering, so that they truly obey the leadership of the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, everyone work together with one heart and one mind, pool their wisdom and efforts, make a big technological revolution, and carry out the work of summarizing the rich experience of traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine with Chinese characteristics, resolutely implement the policy of "medical science serving production, serving the enhancement of people's health, combining research with practice, combining Western medicine with traditional Chinese medicine, using both indigenous and foreign methods, and emphasizing both prevention and treatment," to confluence of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and strive to complete the tasks undertaken by the institute in the national twelve-year science plan seven years in advance or in a shorter period of time, and strive to make Chinese medicine occupy an advanced position in the world!

    医学科学高速度跃进的关键
    中共中国医学科学院委员会第一书记　张之强
    从去年整风运动以来，知识分子的社会主义和共产主义觉悟空前提高。在党的八大二次会议制定总路线之后，在它的光辉照耀下，中国医学科学院同志以无比兴奋的心情和冲天干劲，掀起了技术革命高潮。三个多月来，各研究单位的创造发明和技术革新项目都以千计。在征服危害人民健康最严重的疾病方面，如肿瘤、心脏血管系统疾病、造血系统疾病、流行病、寄生虫病和神经系统疾病等都取得了重大的成绩，有的为世界创举，有的已显露出十分可喜的端倪。根据现在的情况看来，由于树立了党对医学科学的领导，我们可以毫不夸大的预言，在三、五年内，中国医学将在不少方面为世界医药科学作出伟大的贡献，为劳动人民的健康提供新的保证。
    医学科学领域中的两条道路
    斗争仍是目前的主要矛盾
    技术革命运动已有了良好的开端，并取得了巨大成绩，这是对资本主义道路斗争的胜利，但并没有取得全部的胜利，这是因为还有不少资产阶级知识分子特别是资产阶级专家还坚持着资产阶级医学学术思想和资产阶级医学传统。他们看不到辩证唯物主义是推动科学技术前进的动力，党对科学技术的领导是迅速发展我国医学科学事业的根本保证。所以，在医学科学领域中的两条道路的斗争，仍然是目前的主要矛盾。不少资产阶级专家认为医学科学是和疾病作斗争的，因而作为医学科学事业来讲，它不可能有阶级性，也不存在两条道路的问题。这种超阶级超政治的观点是和”医学科学为生产服务，为增强人民健康服务，研究与实际结合，西医与中医结合，土洋并举，防治并举”的方针不相容的。因此，进一步分析批判资产阶级医学学术思想，破除资产阶级传统和旧的习惯势力，巩固地树立党对医学科学的领导，把医学科学研究工作、医疗工作和干部培养工作纳入社会主义建设总路线的轨道，就成为我们医学科学工作者的迫切任务。
    一切为了增强人民健康、为保证工农业大跃进，是医学科学工作的前提和出发点。我们主张理论结合实际，研究工作应为增强人民健康和生产服务。前人通过实践积累了丰富的经验，并将之概括而提高为理论，我们应将其结合实际加以应用，并通过实践积累新的经验，再加以概括和提高。这就是科学事业的发展规律。可是有些资产阶级专家却在具备一定理论和实践基础之后，轻视了实践，迷恋于读文献，埋头于试管和试验室，钻牛角尖，写一些脱离实际的论文以求名得利。也有的人虽然还没有脱离病人的实际，但对于危害广大劳动人民健康最大的疾病却不发生兴趣，对工农业大跃进中所出现的一系列新问题不发生兴趣，如全民炼钢后对烧伤问题，全民办工业后的劳动保护与职业病问题，人民公社成立后环境卫生问题，都急待加以解决，但有些人却对此重大问题没兴趣，而热中于罕见疾病的研究。如蚊子专家在除四害中不去研究如何更快更彻底的消灭蚊子，而仍孜孜不倦地在研究蚊子分类和寻找新蚊种，这不就是充分说明资产阶级专家们在坚持一切为个人名利服务的资本主义道路么？在医疗工作中，我们主张一切面向病人，为病人服务，以医院为基地开展预防工作，而资产阶级专家却主张病人为研究服务，为提高个人技术服务，医院脱离预防，脱离群众。在这种思想指导之下，医院还存在着许多不利于病人的规章制度，医生中普遍存在着重病房轻门诊、重研究轻治疗、重医疗轻预防、治病不治人等对病人极为有害的思想和作风。甚至有将病人作为研究材料而不顾病人生命安全的罪恶行为。因此，发扬共产主义风格、破除资产阶级传统是技术革命的重要环节。
    资产阶级医学传统既表现于业务工作中的规章制度，也表现于无形的习惯势力。科学的发展要求细致的分工是无可非议的，由于分工不同，一定的职务名称也是完全必要的，但问题的实质是科学的分工和职务名称被资产阶级利用来作为统治的一种手段，障碍着科学的发展。这种分工不是分工合作，而是“分割”“独占”。职务愈高愈脱离群众，一级压一级，没有技术民主，上级和下级是“婆婆与媳妇”的关系。这种等级制度和科学的分工是有本质的不同的。在研究工作中，不仅有保密和专利习惯，而且教授有垄断独占的传统，下级技术人员盲目工作，如稍有成就即以教授领衔发表。这一切都是为了使病人为研究服务，下级为专家服务，窒息了新生力量，在科学技术上引起了停滞的趋势。解放后虽进行了不少改革，但没有从根本上消除旧社会所遗留下来的这些资产阶级传统和习惯势力。应该说它的思想根源是资产阶级法权思想，而资产阶级医药权威是它的集中表现。
    北京协和医院脑系科在党的领导下，紧紧依靠群众，从根本上破除了资产阶级传统，冲破了旧的习惯势力，改变了过去高级技术人员脱离病人实际的现象；培养了多面手，使研究与医疗结合，中西医结合；实行了技术民主，全面协作；初步树立了无产阶级办医院的典范，为“游击习气”和“农村作风”恢复了名誉。因而在最近救活了两名过去认为“必死”的病人。
    依靠群众，全民动手，多快好省地进行医学科学的技术革命
    医学科学进行技术革命，是依靠群众、全民动手、多快好省地进行呢，还是依靠少数专家、循序渐进、冷冷清清、少慢差费地进行呢？这是过去没有解决的问题，也是我们和资产阶级专家在研究方法上的分歧。资产阶级专家认为只有专家最聪明、最有天才，如发动群众进行科学研究，就会降低科学水平，就会搞乱。事实证明他们是错误的，在技术革命中绝大多数的创造发明都是群众干出来的，而且干的很出色。如肿瘤免疫，针灸治亚急性放射病和蛋品灭菌等许多创造性的研究，不仅具有重大的实际意义，也有重大的理论价值。而这些都是青年人干的，如发动广大技术人员深入工厂、矿山、农村、森林和街道以后，不仅解决了广大群众的实际问题，而且收集了极为丰富的资料，发现了过去书本上所没有的新问题，找出了防治疾病的新方法。难道这样不是更加速医学科学的发展么？那些仅仅坐在自己的小实验室里面对试管、文献进行脱离实际的想像的人，不显得十分可怜和渺小么？事实证明，只有用群众运动的方法来发展医学科学，才能把群众的无穷智慧和丰富的实际经验发掘出来，才能不断革命不断跃进，才能使技术革命运动的进程从简单到复杂，从低级到高级，不断的前进。
    在群众运动中，专家应该把自己摆在什么位置，这也是一个问题。我们的国家从来是十分重视和爱护专家的，但技术革命既是一个群众运动，首先就得明确专家也是群众中的一员。因之，自己必须积极地参加到技术革命运动中来，既不能压制新生力量作技术革命的绊脚石，也不能站在运动之外隔岸观火。目前有一部分专家却坚持自己的资产阶级学术思想、观点和方法，他们不但不能和群众一道前进，反而在后面指手划脚，甚至采取冷讽热嘲，破坏打击的态度。有的则正处于剧烈的自我斗争中，对旧的有留恋，对新的有希望，但尚有怀疑，有时随着群众前进，有时又站在旁边作观潮派，顾虑多端，拿不定主意。当然还有一部分专家已基本上批判了自己的资产阶级学术思想，破除了资产阶级传统，相信群众力量，依靠党的领导，朝气蓬勃，敢想敢干。由于专家们都来自旧社会，长期受着资产阶级教育，几年来在党的教育下，虽然有了很大进步，但是剥削阶级的思想感情，资产阶级的学术思想，还未从根本上彻底加以解决。因此，必须在这一次技术革命的大熔炉里，在群众的帮助下，作进一步的自我改造。党也将尽一切努力，争取和帮助其积极参加这一伟大的革命运动，相信多数专家是愿意把自己改造好的。最近冯兰洲教授进行了自我批判，虽然还有某些不足的地方，但态度是好的，这就为自我改造创造了条件。只有如此，才能为人民作出有益的贡献，才能得到党和人民的重视。
    中西结合，土洋并举，
    创造我国独特的新医学
    学习中医，中西结合，土洋并举是技术革命的决定因素。祖国医学不论在防治疾病的实践方面或者理论方面，都有许多为西医所不及之处。这一点多次得到了证明。这些宝贵的经验过去由于社会历史条件的限制，长期被埋没。解放后，由于党的正确领导，才被发掘出来了，而且使其发出了万丈光芒。但是，在开展这项工作中，几年来所遇到的阻力很大。在医药卫生技术人员中，特别是一些资产阶级专家，认为中医“不科学”，对中医的效果说是“偶然现象”。这除了说明资产阶级学术思想对医学科学的严重危害和贾桂式的奴隶思想之外，不能作其他解释。我党坚决主张中西结合，土洋并举，取中西医之精华，去中西医之糟粕，达到中西医合流，创造我国独特的新医学。这是我国医学科学跃进的唯一正确的方针。这一方针对我国医药卫生事业有其极为重大的意义。
    全面规划组织大协作是技术革命的重要组织措施。任何工作都是在党的领导下有组织、有计划地进行的。这是社会主义建设的规律。有些人反对科学研究有计划的发展，他们认为科学研究是未知数，不可能有计划，而且计划还会束缚“天才”和“灵感”。我们认为这种认识是错误的。规划不仅提出国家的要求，明确我们的奋斗目标，使研究工作能紧紧结合当前生产需要和人民健康需要，而且可以更好地组织力量，使用力量，并且可以鼓舞人们的积极性和创造性，也可以限制资产阶级思想泛滥，限制脱离国家任务的追求个人名利为目的的研究。在综合研究中，必须以专题为中心，打乱所、院、科、室的界限，而且要进行内外上下的大协作，克服本位主义个人主义，共同为一个目标而奋斗。只有这样，才能互相帮助，取长补短，互相促进，共同发展，共同提高。
    破资产阶级医学权威
    立无产阶级卫生志气
    如果说上面所谈几个问题是技术革命中的关键问题，那么党对医学科学的绝对领导是关键的关键。党能不能领导科学，党要不要领导业务工作，解放后，我们和资产阶级专家一直进行着尖锐斗争，也是一个根本性质的斗争。在思想改造之后，他们承认“党委领导方针政策、政治思想工作”，但却说要“专家领导业务工作”。在整风之前，他们又提出“外行不能领导内行”，实际上都是要坚持“专家专政”。这些资产阶级专家不仅把技术知识作为资本向党讨价还价，拒绝党的领导，抵制党在业务技术方面的方针政策，对国家分配的任务阳奉阴违，消极怠工；而且在工作中用资产阶级的一套权术来霸占地盘，培养自己的“权威”。他们对待新生力量不仅压制打击，而且向青年散布资产阶级毒素。在部分青年中，对党直接领导业务，尚持不同的怀疑态度。故在业务上还不服从党的领导而服从专家的领导。这就充分说明了党对业务工作的领导权还未巩固地树立起来。经过整风和反右之后，形势有了较大的改变，但还没有彻底解决这个问题。我们认为在任何社会里，科学必须为政治服务，所以政治必然要领导业务。我们再从政治上来看内行与外行问题，建设社会主义、共产主义党不是外行，而是内行，因为党懂得怎样使医学科学为人民服务；资产阶级专家却不懂得这一条，所以他们倒是真正的外行。现在看得很清楚，党不仅对科学发展道路、方针、政策的领导上是真正的内行，而且由于政治挂帅、走群众路线、搞技术民主，因此在科学业务上，党也领导得很好。而资产阶级专家不仅不懂得马列主义，而且满脑子的唯心主义和形而上学的观点，充满了资产阶级个人主义，一切从
  “我”出发。所以他们不可能把科学引导到正确的方向。技术革命前后的事实充分的说明了这个问题。在事实面前，有的资产阶级专家
  “服输”了，不仅在政治上愿意服从党的领导，而且在业务上也愿意服从党的领导。但还不是所有的资产阶级专家都是如此，因此我们当前的任务是切实地把业务领导起来，要破资产阶级医药权威，立无产阶级卫生志气。用事实去教育那些尚在动摇的人，使其真正地服从党的领导。在党的领导之下，充分发动群众，大家同心同德，群策群力，大闹技术革命，进行中国特有的中医中药的丰富经验的总结工作，坚决贯彻“医学科学为生产服务，为增强人民健康服务，研究与实际结合，西医与中医结合，土洋并举，防治并举”的方针，为中西医合流，提前七年或在更短一些的时间内完成国家十二年科学规划中本院所担负的任务而努力，为使中国医学居于世界先进地位而努力！
