Xinhua News Agency, October 24th -- The U.S.-Chiang talks in Taipei have ended, and the American propaganda machine is now heavily promoting the idea that Chiang Kai-shek agreed in the talks "not to use force to attack the mainland." This is an attempt to disguise the aggressive face of the United States and promote its conspiracy of "long-term ceasefire" and the creation of "two Chinas."

Even though the United States itself has never ceased using force in the Taiwan Strait area to invade China and carry out military provocations, the Associated Press reported from Taipei today that the United States will use "Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of 'not using force'" as "a new weapon in the Cold War." According to yesterday's Associated Press report, Dulles attached great "importance" to this, because he believed it could reduce the concerns of "the American public and allies" about "dragging the world into war." The official United States Information Service had already publicized the "peaceful intentions" of the American government and the Taiwan authorities and promoted American "self-restraint" in a telegram on the 23rd regarding this aspect of the U.S.-Chiang communique. The Associated Press report indicated that the United States will "definitely" use this to demand that the Chinese people give up their right to unify their territory and accept the so-called "de facto ceasefire in the coastal islands war."

However, facts speak louder than sophistry. Even the American news agencies cannot but admit that the so-called Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of "not using force to attack the mainland" has no practical value at all, because this statement is merely "promising not to do what they have never done" and "explaining a fact that has long existed."

At the same time, this statement itself is a deception. United Press International quoted Washington officials as explaining that this "guarantee" has a "major exception": if China experiences a "rebellion" similar to the Hungarian incident that the U.S. and Chiang hope for, then force will still be used to assist in subverting the People's Republic of China, and the policy in this regard "has not changed." This explanation from Washington officials is entirely consistent with the U.S. policy announced by Dulles in the past. Dulles stated at a press conference on September 30 that if China experiences a "Hungarian-style rebellion," "if a recognized Chinese government requests assistance," then even the use of force by the United States would not constitute "armed intervention in China."

Behind these U.S. actions, the conspiracy of the U.S. authorities to create "two Chinas" is more exposed than ever before. Kyodo News Agency reported from Taipei on the 23rd that "people can clearly see through this meeting that the United States has clearly laid out its two-China policy." The Agence France-Presse reported on the same day that "very reliable American sources" in Taipei revealed at the conclusion of the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks that the U.S. authorities' plan is: after the Taiwan authorities put up the signboard of "renouncing the use of force," "Free China (referring to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group) has become a country in the same category as divided countries such as Korea, Vietnam, and Germany."

### 利用杜蒋会谈　散布“自制”烟幕  美国制造“两个中国”阴谋欲盖弥彰

    利用杜蒋会谈　散布“自制”烟幕
    美国制造“两个中国”阴谋欲盖弥彰
    新华社24日讯　台北的美蒋会谈结束以后，美国宣传机器正在大肆渲染所谓蒋介石在会谈中同意
  “不使用武力进攻大陆”，企图借此掩饰美国的侵略面目，并且推行它“长期停火”和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    尽管美国自己在台湾海峡地区从来没有停止过使用武力来侵犯中国和进行军事挑衅，但是据美联社今天从台北发出的消息说，美国将利用“蒋介石的‘不使用武力’的声明”，作为“在冷战中的一个新武器”。据美联社昨天的消息说，杜勒斯很“重视”这一点，因为他认为这样可以使“美国公众和盟国”减少一些对于把“世界卷入战争”的担心。官方的美国新闻处已经在23日的电讯里就美蒋公报的这个方面宣传美国政府和台湾当局的“和平意图”，宣传美国的“自制”。美联社消息表明，美国将“肯定”会利用这一点来要求中国人民放弃统一自己领土的权利，接受所谓“沿海岛屿战争的事实上的停火”。
    但是，事实胜于诡辩。连美国通讯社也不能不承认，所谓蒋介石
  “不使用武力进攻大陆”的声明根本没有什么实际的价值，因为，这种说法只不过是“答应不做他们一向没有做的事情”和“说明了长期以来已经存在的一个事实”。
    同时，这一声明的本身就是一个骗局。合众国际社引用华盛顿官员的解释说，这项“保证”有一个
  “重大的例外条件”：如果中国发生了美蒋所希望的匈牙利事件一样的“叛乱”，那就仍然要使用武力来协助颠复中华人民共和国，这方面的政策“并没有改变”。华盛顿官员的这一番解释是同杜勒斯过去宣布的美国政策完全一致的，杜勒斯在9月30日的记者招待会上表明，如果中国发生“匈牙利式的叛乱”，“如果有一个得到承认的中国政府要求援助的话”，那么美国即使用武力也算不上“对中国的武装干涉”。
    在美国这些做法的背后，美国当局制造“两个中国”的阴谋比以往任何时候都暴露得更加明显。共同社23日台北消息说，“人们通过这次会谈看得清清楚楚的是，美国已经明确地摊出了两个中国的政策。”同一天法新社的消息指出，台北“非常可靠的美国人士”在杜勒斯蒋介石会谈结束时透露，美国当局的打算是：美国要台湾当局打出“放弃使用武力”的招牌以后，“自由中国（指台湾蒋介石集团）已成为同朝鲜、越南及德国等分裂的国家属于同一类的国家”。
