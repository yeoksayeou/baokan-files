Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd – Pyongyang newspapers today published editorials denouncing the United States for directing the Chiang Kai-shek Group to use missiles to attack mainland China.

The “Rodong Sinmun” editorial said that the criminal, U.S. imperialism, who once dropped the first atomic bomb in human history, is now using missiles for the first time in history. This is the most serious act of provocation not only against the Chinese people but against all peace-loving people.

The editorial said that if such vicious provocative actions by the American aggressors are not stopped immediately, the whole world will inevitably be pushed into the danger of missile and atomic war. All peace-loving people must not stand idly by while the American aggressors dangerously play with fire on the "brink of war."

The editorial said that the purpose of U.S. imperialism in pursuing a policy of war in the Taiwan Strait area is very obvious: they want to expand their aggressive actions of occupying Taiwan to the Chinese mainland. However, the American aggressors should first not forget that they do not have a monopoly on missiles. If they do not stop their adventurous provocative actions and insist on provoking a war, they will inevitably suffer a devastating counterattack.

The editorial said that the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China solemnly declared that punitive counterattacks will be carried out against the perpetrators. The Korean people fully support this firm position of the Chinese people.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. aggressors should bear full responsibility for the situation developing to this point. If they do not wish to perish, they should rein themselves in before it is too late.

The "Democratic Korea" newspaper's editorial said that those who are plotting atomic attacks against the People's Republic of China and openly using missiles should clearly recognize the fact that the other side also has missiles and atomic and hydrogen weapons, and if necessary, can launch them at Washington and New York.

The editorial pointed out that the military provocations of the American aggressive clique in the Taiwan Strait area, especially the use of missiles under its direction, is tightening the noose around its own neck.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”说
    美国使用导弹向中国挑衅  全世界人民不能袖手旁观
    新华社平壤2日电　平壤报纸今天发表社论斥责美国指使蒋介石集团使用导弹进攻中国大陆。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说，曾经在人类历史上投下了第一颗原子弹的罪犯——美帝国主义如今又在历史上第一次使用了导弹，这不仅是对中国人民而且是对所有爱好和平人民的最严重的挑衅行为。
    社论说，如果不立即制止美国侵略者的这种恶毒的挑衅行动，那么必将把全世界推向导弹和原子战争的危险里去。一切爱好和平的人民绝不能对美国侵略者站在“战争边缘”的危险玩火行为袖手旁观。
    社论说，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区推行战争政策的目的是很明显的，它们想把侵占台湾的侵略行动扩大到中国大陆，但是，美国侵略者首先不应该忘记导弹不是它们一家独揽的。如果它们不停止冒险性挑衅行为而硬要挑起战争，那么它们必将遭到歼灭性的回击。
    社论说，中华人民共和国国防部严肃声明将对犯罪者给予惩罚性的回击。朝鲜人民完全支持中国人民的这一坚决的立场。
    社论指出，局势发展到如此境地，应由美国侵略者负完全责任。如果它们还不愿自己灭亡，那么就应当尽早悬崖勒马。
    “民主朝鲜报”的社论说，对中华人民共和国搞原子攻击计划并公然使用导弹的人们应该清楚地认识到这样一个事实，就是：对方也有导弹和原子武器与氢武器，并且如果有必要，还可以把它们发射到华盛顿和纽约去。
    社论指出，美国侵略集团在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅，特别是在它的指使下使用导弹这件事就是勒紧套在它自己脖子上的绞索。
