Introduction to Indigenous Hot Blast Stoves

    (I) Pipe-type Indigenous Hot Blast Stove

    The pipe-type hot blast stove is constructed from red or blue bricks into a rectangular furnace. Glazed pottery pipes are connected in U-shapes and placed within the furnace to serve as heat exchange pipes. Coal is added to one end of the furnace for combustion (or blast furnace gas is introduced into the furnace via pipes for combustion). The pipes are heated, and hot air is obtained by blowing air through them.

    The pipes used in the experiment were ordinary sewer pipes. Six sections and four elbows were used during the experiment. The pipe joints were filled with a mixture of generally heat-resistant clay (crucible clay), green ash (a mixture of soot and lime), and quartz sand (yellow sand is also acceptable) with a small amount of salt, mixed with water. If leaks occur due to cracks in this filling method, a dry filling method can be used, i.e., less water is added, and more compaction is done.

    To avoid air leakage and loss of wind pressure at the joints, the pipes can be made thinner and longer to minimize the number of joints. The inner wall of the pipes is best glazed to reduce air resistance. These pipes can be custom-made at local kiln factories.

    In areas where other high-temperature resistant pipe materials are available (such as white cast iron pipes), other pipe materials can also be used.

    (II) Hollow-type Indigenous Hot Blast Stove

    The hollow-type indigenous hot blast stove has a simple structure and has been successfully implemented at the Qianghua Steel Plant in Emei, Sichuan, on an indigenous blast furnace with an effective volume of 0.67 cubic meters. The hot blast stove has a rectangular shape, with one end tightly adjacent to the blast furnace tuyere and cold air blown in from the other end. To reduce resistance, the inlet and outlet vents are set at the same level. There is a coal-adding hole on the top of the furnace (usually tightly covered, opened when in use). The inner shape of the furnace is funnel-shaped, with grate bars at the bottom and a place to store ash below the grate bars. The ash removal hole is usually tightly sealed and opened when removing ash. The volume of the furnace is 0.27 cubic meters.

    The furnace walls are constructed with a double-layer structure of red or blue bricks, with a 300 mm gap between the inner and outer layers to allow for expansion of the inner layer of bricks after heating. To avoid air leakage and loss, the gap is filled tightly with a mixture of 60% sand and gravel powder and 40% baked yellow mud powder, moistened with water.

    To reduce air volume loss, ensure stable air volume, and ensure the safety of operators, two gates are added to the coal-adding chimney. There is a distance between the two gates. The bottom gate is closed first to add coal, and then the top gate is closed to release the coal. The operation is simple, and building materials are readily available everywhere. According to the experience of the Qianghua Iron Factory, the wind temperature can reach above 400 degrees Celsius. (Attached pictures)

    土热风炉介绍
    （一）管式土热风炉
    管式热风炉是用红砖或青砖砌成一个长方形的炉灶，利用缸瓦管连接成U形管子，安置于炉中，作为热的交换管。在炉子一头加煤燃烧（或利用高炉出来的煤气，用管子引入炉内燃烧）后，管子受热，然后在管中吹风而得热风。
    试验所用的管子就是普通做下水道的管子。试验时用了六节和四个弯头。管子用一般带耐火性的土（坩子土）和青灰（烟灰与石灰混合物）及石英砂（黄砂亦可）加少许食盐，用水拌和后填入接口。这种填法如有裂缝漏风，可改用干填料法，即少调水，多捣固。
    为了避免接头漏风损失风压，可将管子做的更细些和更长些，尽量减少接头。管子内壁最好涂釉，以减少风的阻力。这种管子可在附近烧缸的地方定做。
    在有其他耐高热的管材的地方（如用白口铁铸管）亦可用其他管材。
    （二）空心式土热风炉
    空心式土热风炉结构简单，四川峨眉强华钢铁厂在一座有效容积零点六七立方公尺的土高炉上应用成功。热风炉外形是一个长方形，一端紧挨着高炉风嘴，由另一端吹入冷风，为了减少阻力，进出风口设置在同一水平上。炉顶上有一个加煤孔（平时盖严，用时揭开）。炉子的内形为漏斗式，底部有炉条，炉条下是储灰的地方。清灰孔平时紧密封闭，清灰的时候就打开。炉子容积零点二七立方公尺。
    炉墙用红砖或青砖砌双层结构，内外层之间留有三百公厘的空隙作为内层砖受热后膨胀的余地。为了避免漏风损失，空隙中采取60％的砂石粉和40％经过烘烤的黄泥粉，混水润湿后填紧。
    为了减少风量损失，保证风量稳定和操作人员安全，在加煤囱上加上两个闸门，两个闸门之间有一段距离，先关底下的一个闸门加煤，然后关上面的闸门放煤。操作简便，建炉材料到处有，据强华铁工厂的经验，风温可以达到摄氏四百度以上。（附图片）
