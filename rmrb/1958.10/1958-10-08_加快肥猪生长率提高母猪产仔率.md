    Accelerate Fattening Pig Growth Rate and Increase Sow Litter Size
    Xu Ji
    A few months ago, I went to Hunan to study some technical issues concerning the development of collective pig raising. At that time, the main problem I considered was developing the number of pigs. Later, I saw reports in the newspapers about a pig gaining thirteen or fourteen jin a day, a mu producing 1.2 million jin of green fodder, and bold plans for fattening pigs to 1,000 or 2,000 jin a year and sows producing litters of fifty piglets. This inspired us to shift our attention from the number of pigs raised to quality.
    The example of a pig gaining more than ten jin a day shows that with good feed conditions, plus technical measures, the daily weight gain of fattening pigs can be greatly increased. However, such high daily weight gains cannot be sustained at present. How to maintain a very high daily weight gain and make it rise in a straight line is a research topic before us. Secondly, increasing the number of pigs requires a corresponding increase in labor and pigsties. If we can make a fattening pig grow as much meat in half a year as it now grows in a year, or even more, then even if the feed is not reduced, we can save labor and pigsties and accelerate capital turnover. What method can be used to achieve this goal? Thirdly, the current highest record for sow litters is twenty-nine piglets, while the average sow litter is only eleven or twelve piglets. If the sow's litter rate is increased, we can raise fewer sows, raise more fattening pigs, and reduce the cost of piglets. How can we greatly increase the sow's litter rate without excessively reducing the birth weight of the piglets? These are all new problems brought about by the new situation. Of course, this is not the entire problem.

    加快肥猪生长率提高母猪产仔率

    前几个月，我曾到湖南去研究发展集体养猪的若干技术问题，当时我所考虑的主要问题是发展猪的数量。以后，我在报纸上看到了一口猪一天增重十三、四斤的报道，亩产青饲料一百二十万斤和肥猪一年养到一、二千斤，母猪一胎产仔五十头的大胆计划，这启示我们应当从注意养猪数量，转到注意质量。
    一口猪一天增重十斤以上的事例，说明在良好的饲料条件下，再加上技术措施，可以大大提高肥猪的日增重量。但是，现在这样高的日增重量还不能持续；怎样维持很高的日增重量，并使它直线上升，这是摆在我们面前的一个研究课题。其次，增加养猪头数需要相应增加劳动力和猪舍。如果我们能够使肥猪半年内长的肉相当于现在一年内长的肉，或者更多，那么，即使饲料没有减少，也可以节省劳动力和畜舍，加速资金周转。用什么办法来达到这个目的呢？第三，目前母猪产仔的最高纪录是一胎二十九头，一般母猪产仔猪一胎只有十一、二头；如果母猪产仔率提高，就可以少养母猪，多养肥猪，并且降低仔猪成本。怎样在不过于降低仔猪初生体重的条件下，大大提高母猪产仔率呢？这些都是新形势带来的新问题。当然，这还不是问题的全部。
