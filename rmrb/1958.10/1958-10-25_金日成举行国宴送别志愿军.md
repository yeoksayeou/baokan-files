Kim Il-sung said: The Korean people will forever stand with the Chinese people in the struggle against aggression.
Yang Yong said: The American aggressors' shameless interference in our country and Korea is bound to be crushed.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 24th: Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, held a grand state banquet in Pyongyang tonight to bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) who are about to return home. General Yang Yong, Commander of the CPV, General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, and more than 450 generals and soldier representatives from the CPV headquarters were invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Kim Il-sung first delivered a speech at the banquet (full text on page 2). On behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic, and all the Korean people, he expressed his infinite gratitude and high honor to the last group of returning officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers have left behind great achievements in Korea that our people will never forget. The Korean War was one of the most brutal wars in human history. In this war, the unparalleled heroism and bravery you displayed shook the world. The great achievements you have made are a model of proletarian internationalism. It will forever be recorded in the annals of progressive humanity.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has made a tremendous contribution to promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing the tense situation in the East. This is a manifestation of the growing strength of the peace-loving people of Korea and China, and a concrete manifestation of the unprecedentedly powerful peace forces in the world. The Chinese People's Volunteers are about to withdraw completely from Korea. However, disregarding the sincere efforts of the peace-loving people of Korea and China, the American imperialists continue to occupy South Korea and are even more blatantly pursuing a policy of aggression that seriously threatens peace. He said that disregarding the repeated and serious warnings from the Chinese people, American imperialism continues to carry out acts of aggression against the Chinese people in Taiwan and the coastal islands of China, seriously threatening world peace.

Premier Kim Il-sung said that the Korean people will forever stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people in the struggle to defend the achievements of the revolution and oppose imperialist aggression. American imperialism should withdraw from South Korea and Taiwan as soon as possible.

General Yang Yong first expressed his heartfelt thanks to Premier Kim Il-sung and the Korean people in his speech (full text on page 2). He said: Eight years ago today, it was the eve of the battle in which our army launched the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea; and today, we have completed the mission given to us by the people of the motherland and returned victoriously. He said: From all the changes we have personally experienced in the past eight years, we have come to the conclusion that no force can stop the advance of our just cause! We firmly believe that the peaceful reunification of the heroic Korean people will surely be realized, and the shameless interference of the American aggressors in our country and Korea will inevitably be crushed.

Attending tonight's banquet were: Choe Yong-gon, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Kim Il, Hong Myung-hui, Jeong Il-ryong, Nam Il, and Ri Ju-yeon; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jeong-ae, Park Kim-cheol, and Kim Chang-man; General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense; Ministers of the Cabinet; Ministers of various departments of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party; senior generals and combat heroes of the Korean People's Army; heads of various democratic parties and social organizations; well-known figures from all walks of life; "Volunteer Army Mother" Liu Mei; and support-the-front models Shi Jiyong and Gu Fuli, etc.

    金日成举行国宴送别志愿军
    金日成说：朝鲜人民在反侵略斗争中永远和中国人民站在一起
    杨勇说：美国侵略者对我国和朝鲜的无耻干涉必然要被粉碎
    据新华社平壤24日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成今晚在平壤举行盛大国宴，欢送即将离朝返国的中国人民志愿军总部官兵。志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将和志愿军总部的将军们、官兵代表共四百五十多人应邀出席了宴会。
    金日成首相在宴会上首先致词（全文见第二版）。他代表朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全朝鲜人民，向最后一批归国的中国人民志愿军官兵和中国人民，致以无限的感谢和崇高的荣誉。他说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜留下了我们人民永远不能忘记的伟大功绩。朝鲜战争是人类历史上最残酷的战争之一。在这一战争中，你们所发挥的无比的英雄气概和勇敢，惊动了全世界。你们所建立的伟大功勋，是无产阶级国际主义的榜样。它将永远记载在进步人类的史册上。
    金日成首相说，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，对促进朝鲜的和平统一和缓和东方紧张局势作出了巨大的贡献。这是热爱和平的朝中两国人民力量成长了的表现，是全世界和平力量空前强大的具体表现。中国人民志愿军就要从朝鲜撤完了。但是，美帝国主义者不顾热爱和平的朝中两国人民的真挚努力，继续霸占南朝鲜，更加露骨地进行严重威胁和平的侵略政策。他说，美帝国主义不顾中国人民屡次的严重警告，在台湾和中国沿海岛屿继续进行反对中国人民的侵略行为，严重地威胁着全世界的和平。
    金日成首相说，朝鲜人民将在保卫革命的成果，反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，永远坚决地站在中国人民的这一边。美帝国主义应当尽快地从南朝鲜和台湾撤走。
    杨勇上将在致词中首先向金日成首相和朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢（全文见第二版）。他说：八年前的今天，正是我军揭开抗美援朝战争序幕的战斗前夜；而今天，我们已经完成了祖国人民给予我们的使命，胜利返回了。他说：八年来亲自经历的一切变化中，我们得出了这样一个结论：没有任何力量能阻挡我们的正义事业前进！我们坚定地相信，英雄的朝鲜人民的和平统一事业一定能够实现，美国侵略者对我国和对朝鲜的无耻干涉，必然要被粉碎。
    参加今晚宴会的有：朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健，内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，民族保卫相金光侠大将，内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长，朝鲜人民军高级将领、战斗英雄，各民主政党、社会团体的负责人，各界著名人士，“志愿军妈妈”柳梅，支前模范石吉荣、具富力等。
