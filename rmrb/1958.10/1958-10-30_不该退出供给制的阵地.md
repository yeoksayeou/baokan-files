	Should Not Retreat from the Position of the Supply System
	Chen Ming
	The supply system is a revolutionary and advanced distribution system.
	It has the following two characteristics: First, it can destroy the hierarchical concept of bourgeois right and realize the principle of communist life equality. Second, it can maintain a standard of living roughly equal to that of the local masses. Obviously, this system is not only suitable for the war period but also for the construction period. If we can always maintain the position of the supply system and gradually expand it, it should be in line with the law of revolutionary development. But the result was a detour. In the following years, the supply system completely withdrew from its position, giving way to the wage system, which reflected bourgeois right. Was this progress or regression? Was this weakening, breaking down, and squeezing out the remnants of bourgeois right, or consolidating the bourgeois right system? The truth is self-evident. True, Marx once said that "bourgeois right" is "inevitable in the first phase of communist society..." But he did not say that we should not weaken it, shake it, but maintain it and consolidate it. On the contrary, he told us that we must "completely overcome" it. So, what reason is there to give up all the advanced positions that have been established for more than 20 years?

    不该退出供给制的阵地
    陈明
    供给制是一种革命的、先进的分配制度。
    它有以下两个特征：一、可以破坏资产阶级法权的等级观念，实现共产主义生活平等的原则。二、可以保持着与当地一般群众大体相等的生活水平。显然，这种制度不仅适用于战争时期，也适应于建设时期，如果能够一直保持供给制的阵地，并逐步加以扩大，这应当是合乎革命发展规律的。但结果却走了一段弯路，以后几年，供给制却全部退出阵地，让位给反映资产阶级法权的工资制。这是前进了呢，还是后退了呢？这是在削弱、破除与挤掉资产阶级法权的残余呢，还是巩固了资产阶级法权制呢？道理当然是不辩自明的。不错，马克思曾经说过：“资产阶级式的法权”，“在共产主义社会第一阶段中，……是不可避免的。”但他并没有说因此就不要削弱它、动摇它而去维持它、巩固它，相反，他告诉我们必须“完全克服”它。那么，有什么理由要把已经建立了二十多年的先进阵地全部让出来呢？
