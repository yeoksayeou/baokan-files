Editor's Note: In the Open Letter to Taiwan Compatriots by our Minister of National Defense, it was pointed out that "the Americans, compelled by circumstances, have changed their policy." To help readers understand this change in American policy, we will publish relevant materials in succession. Today we are publishing the Chiang Kai-shek-Dulles Joint Communiqué and Nixon's remarks.

Thus the Chiang-Dulles Joint Communiqué
The United States Forces the Taiwan Authorities to Accept the Principle of "Renouncing the Use of Force"
Considers the Chiang Kai-shek Group as Merely a Spokesperson for "Free China"

According to the Associated Press report, the full text of the Chiang Kai-shek-Dulles Joint Communiqué is as follows:

In accordance with Article IV of the Mutual Defense Treaty, the United States Government and the Government of the Republic of China have been holding consultations for the past three days.

These consultations were held at the invitation of President Chiang Kai-shek. Among those participating in the consultations were the following:

On the Republic of China side:

President Chiang Kai-shek, Vice President and Premier Chen Cheng, Secretary-General to the President Chang Chun, Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Shao-ku, Ambassador to the United States Yeh Kung-chao.

On the United States of America side: Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State Walter S. Robertson, Ambassador to the Republic of China Everett Drumright.

These consultations were arranged during the two weeks in which the Chinese Communists announced their intention to implement a ceasefire against Jinmen.

It was hoped that, under these circumstances, it would be possible to mainly consider measures that could help stabilize a de facto non-belligerent situation.

However, on the eve of the consultations, the Chinese Communists violated their declaration and resumed shelling Jinmen. In view of these developments, the consultations naturally focused on the military aspects of the situation.

The following point was recognized: In the current situation, the defense of Jinmen, together with Mazu, is closely related to the defense of Taiwan and Penghu.

The two governments recalled that the purpose of their mutual defense treaty is to demonstrate their unity, so that potential aggressors will not harbor illusions that any one of them is alone in the Western Pacific region. These consultations provided a new opportunity to demonstrate this unity.

The two governments reaffirmed that they stand united in the face of the new aggression by the Chinese Communists, which is currently manifested in the bombardment of Jinmen. This aggression and the simultaneous propaganda of the Chinese Communists have not divided them as the Communists had hoped. On the contrary, these actions have brought them closer together.

They believe that their unity against aggression not only helps themselves but also helps the cause of peace. As President Eisenhower said on September 11, a stance against armed aggression is the only stance consistent with world peace.

The two governments noted that the Chinese Communists, with the support of the Soviet Union, are openly attempting to conquer Taiwan, eliminate Free China, drive the United States out of the entire Western Pacific, and force the United States to abandon its collective security arrangements with free countries in the region. This policy can never succeed. Both sides hope and believe that the Communists, in the face of the demonstrated unity, determination, and strength of the United States and the Republic of China, will not test their policy with a full-scale war, and they will abandon the military steps they have taken to embark on their futile and dangerous policy.

In addition to discussing the current military situation, the two governments also considered the broad and long-term aspects of their relationship.

The United States, its government and people, will always trust the Chinese people and deeply respect the great contributions they have made and will continue to make to a civilization that respects the individual and family life.

The United States recognizes the Republic of China as the true spokesperson for Free China and the hopes and aspirations cherished by the vast Chinese people.

The Government of the Republic of China declares that its purpose is to be a worthy representative of the Chinese people and to strive to maintain the nature and characteristics that have always enabled the Chinese people to make many beneficial contributions to mankind.

The two governments reaffirmed their adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter. They recalled that the treaty under which they act is defensive in nature. The Government of the Republic of China believes that restoring freedom to its people on the mainland is its sacred mission.

It believes that the basis of this mission is the hearts of the Chinese people, and that the main means of successfully realizing this mission is to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People (Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood), rather than the use of force.

As a result of the consultations, there has been an opportunity for a thorough study and re-examination of urgent issues of common concern. Therefore, these consultations have proven to be of great value to both governments. Both sides believe that such consultations should continue to be held at appropriate intervals.

### 如此蒋杜会谈公报  美国迫使台湾当局接受“放弃使用武力”原则  认为蒋介石集团不过是“自由中国”的发言人

    编者按：我国国防部长再告台湾同胞书中，指出了“美国人迫于形势，改变了政策”。为了帮助读者了解美国政策的这一改变，我们将陆续发表一些有关材料。今天发表的是蒋介石—杜勒斯联合公报和尼克松的谈话。
    如此蒋杜会谈公报
    美国迫使台湾当局接受“放弃使用武力”原则
    认为蒋介石集团不过是“自由中国”的发言人
    据美联社报道的蒋介石—杜勒斯联合公报全文如下：
    根据共同防御条约第四条，美国政府和中华民国政府过去三天来一直在举行磋商。
    这些磋商是由蒋介石总统邀请举行的。参加磋商者当中有下列人员：
    中华民国方面：
    蒋介石总统、副总统兼行政院院长陈诚、总统府秘书长张群、外交部长黄少谷、驻美国大使叶公超。
    美利坚合众国方面：国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯、助理国务卿华尔特·斯·罗伯逊、驻中华民国大使埃弗雷特·德鲁姆赖特。
    这次磋商是安排在中国共产党人宣布他们要对金门实行停火的两个星期中举行的。
    本来希望，在这种情况之下，本来可以主要考虑那些原可有助于稳定一种实际的非战局面的措施。
    但是，在磋商的前夕，中国共产党人违反了他们的宣言，恢复了对金门的炮击，鉴于这些事态发展，这些磋商当然着重讨论了局势的军事方面。
    下面这一点被认识到，在目前情况下，金门连同马祖的防务，是同台湾和澎湖的防务密切相关的。
    两国政府忆及，它们的共同防御条约的目的在于显示它们的团结，以便潜在的侵略者不致于怀抱幻想，以为它们中间的任何一个在西太平洋地区是孤独的。这些磋商提供了一个新的机会来显示这种团结。
    两国政府重申它们在中国共产党人的新的侵略面前是团结一致的，这种新的侵略目前表现为对金门的轰击。这种侵略和中国共产党人同时进行的宣传并没有像共产党人所希望的那样使它们分裂。相反，这种行动使它们更加密切了。
    它们相信，它们团结一致地反对侵略，这就不但帮助了自己，而且帮助了和平事业。像艾森豪威尔总统在9月11日所说的那样，反对武力侵略的立场是唯一符合世界和平的立场。
    两国政府注意到，中国共产党人在苏联的支持下公然企图征服台湾，消灭自由中国，把美国赶出整个西太平洋，迫使美国放弃它跟这个地区的自由国家作出的集体安全安排。这个政策是决不可能成功的。双方希望并且相信，共产党人在美国和中华民国政府的已经得到证明的团结、决心和力量面前，不会以全面战争来试验他们的政策，他们会放弃他们为了着手实行他们的徒劳无益而危险的政策而已经采取的军事步骤。
    除了讨论当前的军事局势以外，两国政府还考虑了它们的关系中广泛和长远的方面。
    美国，它的政府和人民，永远信任中国人民，并且深为尊重他们对于尊重个人及其家庭生活的文明已经作出和将要继续作出的巨大贡献。
    美国承认中华民国是自由中国的以及广大中国人民所抱的希望和愿望的真正发言人。
    中华民国政府宣布，它的目的是要做中国人民的当之无愧的代表，并且努力保持使中国人一直能够作出对人类有利的许多贡献的性质和特征。
    两国政府重申，它们忠于联合国宪章的原则。它们忆及，它们据以采取行动的条约是防御性质的。中华民国政府认为，恢复它在大陆上的人民的自由是它的神圣使命。
    它认为，这个使命的基础就是中国人民的人心，而胜利地实现这个使命的主要手段是实行孙逸仙博士的三民主义（民族、民权、民生），而不是使用武力。
    由于进行了磋商，就有机会对共同有关的迫切问题进行透彻的研究和重新审查。因此，这种磋商已证明对于两国政府是有巨大价值的。双方认为，这种磋商应该每隔适当的时期继续举行。
