Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th: Xincheng County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, using indigenous methods, mined over 670,000 tons of coal in nineteen hours on the 14th, exceeding the entire annual output of a pair of modern medium-sized mines. This is an unprecedented miracle in China's coal mining history.

From 11:25 PM on the 13th to 6:25 PM on the 14th, the county organized a 70,000-strong coal mining army to conquer five large mountains and fourteen earthen ridges, mining a total of 671,490 tons of coal, equivalent to the county's original two-year coal production target. After the coal was mined, it was transported down the mountainside using aerial cableways and other methods and piled up. Nine inspection teams and twenty-three sub-teams, composed of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Inspection Group, the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee, the Xincheng County Committee, and various township Party committees, conducted separate checks and calculations, proving the figures to be completely accurate.

Xincheng County's release of such a large coal production "satellite" is a glorious victory for the Xincheng County Party organization and the people of the entire county in implementing the "small native groups" policy and vigorously launching mass movements under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Autonomous Region Party Committee. The county is rich in coal reserves. To date, 32 coal mines have been discovered throughout the county. During the nationwide campaign to produce iron and steel, the County Party Committee believed that the large-scale launch of iron and steel "satellites" depended mainly on whether the reserves of raw materials and fuel were sufficient. Therefore, it decided to fight a "grain and grass" reserve battle first. It then issued a battle order for a general war to reserve 300,000 tons of iron and steel "grain and grass." Subsequently, it extensively launched activities among the people of the entire county such as "People rely on food and salaries, crops rely on fertilizer to grow, can iron and steel do without grain and grass?" "How to reserve grain and grass?" "For whom to reserve grain and grass?" These activities included big blooming, big character posters, big debates, big propaganda, big martial arts competitions, big challenges, and big races. More than 130,000 big character posters were posted throughout the county. The County Party Committee called on secretaries to go to the front lines, outstanding cadres to go to the front lines, good sons and daughters to go to the front lines, and the entire people to go to the front lines. The First Secretary personally took command, leading all the County Committee members in the county and 90% of the cadres to the front lines, making the construction site their home and fighting alongside the masses.

After thirty hours of full preparation, starting on the night of the 13th, the county organized a 70,000-strong iron and steel coal mining field army, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, divided into eight field divisions, setting off a vigorous coal mining upsurge to "seize grain and grass for the steel commander from the coal mines." The coal mining army adopted three methods of mining: the first was large-scale stripping, which involved stripping off all the topsoil of an earthen ridge at once, and then mining the coal seam; the second was blasting, where blasting was used to bring down mountain rocks or coal seams in areas near rocky mountains or where the coal seam was very high; the third was in areas where the coal seam was very large and the slope was very steep, the topsoil was stripped off, and cattle were used to pull double-wheeled double-share plows and harrows to plow and rake out the coal. These methods increased coal mining efficiency by dozens of times.

Currently, the entire county is concentrating all manpower, animal-drawn carts, and various aerial cableways, sledges, etc., to transport large quantities of coal to various industrial construction sites.

    忻城气盖世  日产赛煤都
    一天产煤六十七万吨超过现代化中型矿井年产量
    新华社南宁16日电　广西僮族自治区忻城县14日在十九个小时内，用土法采煤六十七万多吨，超过一对现代化的中型矿井全年的产量。这是我国采煤史上从来没有过的奇迹。
    全县自13日下午十一时二十五分起，到14日下午六时二十五分止，组织了七万人的采煤大军攻克了五座大山和十四座土岭，共采煤六十七万一千四百九十吨，等于全县原定两年的产煤量。这些煤挖出后用空中滑线等运到山下堆好，经自治区党委检查团、柳州地委、忻城县委及各乡党委组成的九个验收大队，二十三个验收小队分头查算，证明数字完全准确。
    忻城县放出这样大的采煤“卫星”，是忻城县党组织和全县人民在中共中央和自治区党委领导下贯彻“小土群”方针大搞群众运动的辉煌胜利。这个县煤藏丰富，截至目前止，全县已发现煤矿山三十二处。在全民大办钢铁运动中，县委认为大放钢铁“卫星”除了领导的决心以外，主要取决于原料和燃料的储备是否充足，因此决定先打一个“粮草”储备仗。并发出了为储备三十万吨钢铁“粮草”而进行总体战的战斗命令。接着，在全县人民中广泛地开展“人靠粮饷，禾靠肥长，钢铁无粮草行不行？”“怎样去储备粮草？”“为谁去储备粮草？”的大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、大宣传、大打擂台、大挑战、大竞赛。全县共贴出大字报十三万多张。县委号召书记上前线，优秀干部上前线，好儿女上前线，全民上前线。第一书记亲自挂帅，率领在县里的全部县委委员和90％的干部上前线，以工地为家，和群众共同战斗。
    经过三十个小时的充分准备，从13日夜晚开始，全县组织了一个包括工农兵学商共七万人的钢铁挖煤野战军，下设八个野战师，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的“向煤矿山夺取钢帅粮草”的采煤高潮。采煤大军采用了三种方法开采：第一是大剥皮，就是把一个土岭的全部表土一次剥光，然后开采煤层：第二是爆破，靠近石山的地方或煤层很高的地方，用爆破法把山石或煤层崩下来；第三是在煤层很大、坡度很大的地方，把表土剥去，用牛套着双轮双铧犁和耙把煤犁耙出来。采用这几种方法，使采煤效率提高几十倍。
    目前，全县正集中所有人、畜力车和各种空中滑线、滑板等，把大批煤炭运到各工业工地。
