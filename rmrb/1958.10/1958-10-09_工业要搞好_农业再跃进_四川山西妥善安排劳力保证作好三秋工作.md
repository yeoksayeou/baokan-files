To Do a Good Job in Industry, Agriculture Must Take Another Leap Forward
Sichuan and Shanxi Properly Arrange Labor to Ensure Good Autumn Harvest Work

(By our correspondent from Chengdu, 6th) Sichuan Province, holding high the banner of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, while vigorously developing steel production, is further improving agricultural production, and is launching a new upsurge of production throughout the province. At present, tens of millions of laborers across the province are投入involved in agricultural production. After seizing the time to harvest mid-season rice, they are also working hard to carry out deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement and water conservancy construction. Up to now, late autumn crops in various places have generally been top-dressed once or twice, and 50,000 to 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu has been prepared for next year's early spring crops, and the area of deep-plowed land has been completed by 30% to 50% or more.

Since late September, with the development of the movement to establish people's communes in various places, more than 10 million laborers have been successively transferred to steel production, setting off a vigorous steelmaking and ironmaking movement. While transferring part of the labor force to support steel production, various places have strengthened their leadership over agricultural production in accordance with the spirit of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and changed their working methods. Production units whose production team leaders or group leaders have been transferred have immediately carried out leadership cadre re-elections or elected temporary agents after the steel army set off. Some communes have also implemented merging teams and merging groups, and adjusted production organizations in a timely manner. When transferring manpower, counties such as Pi County and Shehong County appropriately left backbone forces or formed production assault teams to drive ordinary commune members to continue production as usual. Various places have also uniformly allocated labor forces according to the needs of current production work, divided battle lines, and formed several large armies and specialized production teams in agriculture for harvesting, deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and sowing early spring crops, assigning dedicated personnel, clarifying division of labor, so that all aspects of work can advance simultaneously. Many places have also carried out large-scale cooperation within the larger scope of districts and communes, and uniformly allocated labor forces according to needs.

In order to strive for a double harvest of steel and agriculture, various places initially grasped the political and ideological education of the broad masses of farmers on the simultaneous development of steel and agricultural production, mutual support, and mutual promotion. Through propaganda forms such as meetings, blackboards, mobilization signs, and mobile folk art performances, the significance of developing the steel industry was explained to the farmers, so that they realized that steel production was as important as agricultural production. At the same time, various places also launched a mass debate on "How to support steel production, do a good job in agricultural production, and set off two upsurges," criticizing the negative and erroneous ideas of a few people who thought that "if people are transferred to engage in industry, agriculture will not be able to take a leap forward" and "industry will be important in the future, and agriculture will not be important anymore."

After receiving education, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers was high, and their production enthusiasm was further improved. They looked for production tricks and tapped labor potential from many aspects. Various places have formed detachments, brigades, battalions, companies, etc. organized in the form of the army, with the people's commune as a unit, and worked together under unified leadership, and have generally organized collective canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries. Because the people's communes run canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries, a large number of women have been freed from household labor and actively participated in production. After the Wenjiang area liberated the female labor force, more than 900,000 laborers could be added. Women in Suining County put forward the slogan: "Men go to the mountains (to make steel), women hold up the sky, auxiliary labor (semi-labor) is the main labor, one day is equal to three days." After hard study, many women quickly mastered the complete set of techniques such as plowing fields with cattle and invested in deep plowing. Some elderly people and children also took the initiative to participate in some light work, replacing some of the strong laborers to do the main hard work.

In addition, various places have also carried out tool improvement and technological innovation in agricultural production to improve work efficiency. After testing in Mianyang, Nanchong, Suining and other areas, they improved wheeled plows, new-style plows, and promoted deep plowing plows and deep digging hoes, so that they could not only plow deeply but also improve efficiency. Due to the promotion of more than 170,000 deep plowing plows and more than 530,000 deep digging hoes in the Suining area, the area of ​​deep plowing and deep digging land in the area has increased sharply from more than 300,000 mu to more than 1.8 million mu in the past week.

(By our correspondent) Shanxi Province, in the vigorous development of steel production, some areas have once relaxed their leadership over agricultural production, resulting in weak leadership, insufficient labor, and slow progress in autumn harvest, wheat planting, and deep plowing. In order to reverse this phenomenon, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee recently held an emergency telephone conference, requiring party committees at all levels to grasp steel production with one hand and agriculture with the other, with party secretaries dividing responsibilities and reasonably allocating manpower, and establishing two industrial and agricultural production teams from top to bottom. The meeting also proposed that, while ensuring that the steel marshal is enthroned, a campaign should be launched to rush to harvest the autumn crops and plant wheat, to ensure the timely completion of the province's more than 16 million mu of winter wheat sowing and more than 40 million mu of autumn crop harvesting and deep plowing tasks. At the same time, 110 cadres were transferred from the provincial agricultural leading departments to Jinan, Changzhi, Yuci, Yanbei, Xinzhou and other places, respectively, to cooperate with the autumn harvest and autumn planting inspection groups organized by each special zone, about 5,000 people, to conduct in-depth inspections and promotion.

    工业要搞好　农业再跃进
    四川山西妥善安排劳力保证作好三秋工作
    本报成都6日电　四川省高举工农业并举的大旗，在大搞钢铁生产的同时，进一步搞好农业生产，在全省范围内掀起新的生产高潮。目前，全省有数千万个劳动力投入农业生产，他们在抓紧时间收完中稻以后，又在紧张地进行深耕、积肥、改良土壤和兴修水利等工作。到现在为止，各地晚秋作物已普遍施了一至二次追肥，并为明年每亩小春作物准备了五至十万斤肥料，深耕地面积已完成30％至50％以上。
    全省自9月下旬以来，随着各地开展建立人民公社运动，陆续抽调了一千多万个劳动力投入钢铁生产，掀起轰轰烈烈的炼钢炼铁运动。各地在抽调部分劳动力支援钢铁生产的同时，根据工农业并举精神，加强了对农业生产的领导，改变了工作方法。一些生产队长或小组长被调走的生产单位，在钢铁大军出发以后，立即进行领导干部补选或推举临时代理人。有的公社还实行了并队、并组，及时调整了生产组织。郫县、射洪等县在抽调人力时，都适当留下骨干力量，或组成生产突击队，带动一般社员，照常生产。各地还根据当前生产工作的需要，统一调配劳动力，划分战线，在农业上组成收获、深耕、积肥、播种小春等数路大军和专业生产队，固定专人，明确分工，使各方面工作齐头并进。许多地方还在区、公社之间的大范围内开展了大协作，根据需要统一调配劳动力。
    为了力争钢铁和农业双丰收，各地一开始便抓紧了对广大农民进行关于钢铁和农业生产齐头并进，互相支援，互相促进的政治思想教育。通过开会、黑板报、鼓动牌和流动文艺说唱等宣传形式，向农民讲解了发展钢铁工业的意义，使他们认识到钢铁生产与农业生产同样重要。与此同时，各地还展开了“如何支援钢铁生产，搞好农业生产，掀起两个高潮”的群众性鸣放大辩论，批判了少数人认为“抽调人去搞工业，农业就无法跃进了”和“今后工业重要，农业不重要了”等消极错误思想。
    受到教育以后，广大农民热情高涨，生产积极性进一步提高，他们从多方面找生产窍门，挖劳动潜力。各地都以人民公社为单位，按军队的组织形式编成支队、大队、营、连等，有领导地统一作息，并普遍组织起集体食堂、幼儿园、托儿所。由于人民公社举办了食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、大量妇女摆脱了家务劳动，积极参加生产。温江专区解放了妇女劳动力以后，可以增加九十多万个劳动力。遂宁县妇女提出口号：“男人上了山（炼钢铁），女人顶着干，附劳（半劳动）当主劳，一天当三天”。许多妇女经过刻苦钻研学习，很快就掌握了使牛犁田等全套技术，投入深耕工作。一些老年人和儿童，也主动参加作些轻巧活路，把一部分强劳动力替换下来，去干主要的吃力活路。
    此外，各地在农业生产中还进行改良工具和革新技术，来提高工效。绵阳、南充、遂宁等专区经过试验以后，改良了带轮犁、新式犁和推广深耕犁、深挖锄，作到既耕得深又能提高效率。遂宁专区由于推广深耕犁十七万多件、深挖锄五十三万多件，因此全区深耕深挖土地在最近一周内，即由三十多万亩激增到一百八十多万亩。

    本报讯　山西省在大搞钢铁生产中，有些地区对农业生产的领导曾一度放松，使秋收、种麦、深耕发生领导力量薄弱、劳力不足、进度缓慢的现象。为了扭转这一现象，中共山西省委在最近召开紧急电话会议，要求各级党委一手抓钢铁，一手抓农业，党委书记分工负责，合理调配人力，从上而下的建立两支工农业生产队伍。会议还提出，目前在保证钢铁元帅升帐的情况下，开展一个秋收、种麦突击运动，保证按时完成全省一千六百多万亩冬小麦的播种和四千多万亩大秋作物收割和深耕的任务。同时从省级农业领导部门抽调一百一十多名干部，分别到晋南、长治、榆次、雁北、忻县等地，配合各专区组织的约五千人的秋收、秋种检查团，深入检查推动。　（武赞庭）（附图片）
