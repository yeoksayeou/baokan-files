    Old Mother's Affection
    Weng Qihua
    Xu Suzhen, the head of the Xiamen City Xiajing Lane Women's Support-the-Front Service Team, returned from the street office and excitedly told everyone: To celebrate the victory at the front, the neighborhood committee is preparing to send representatives to the front lines to慰问 (offer condolences to) their loved ones… Before she could finish speaking, everyone erupted in excitement like a pot of boiling water.
    "Can we go empty-handed to see the children?" asked sixty-four-year-old Xu Jin, with a hint of reproach, to the team leader.
    "Yes! The People's Liberation Army uncles guard the coast day and night, protecting us so we can live peaceful lives. This time we should at least send some gifts!" Xiu Rong, the team leader's daughter and a third-grade student, voiced what everyone was thinking. Xu Suzhen smiled and said, "The representatives have to leave in an hour. Those who want to send gifts should hurry and get them ready!"
    As soon as she said this, thud, thud, thud, the room emptied in an instant.
    What kind of gifts would best express their feelings? The old mothers all knew in their hearts.
    Xu Jin quickly walked into the back room, took down a jackfruit (菠萝蜜) can from the top of the kitchen cabinet, carefully wiped away the dust, polished the can until it shone brightly, and then examined it carefully with a satisfied smile. There was a story behind this can: Over a month ago, Old Mother Xu fell ill, lost her appetite, and couldn't eat for two or three days, which further weakened her. When her neighbor, Sister-in-law Guoliang, saw that Old Mother's appetite had decreased and that her son was busy with work and had little time to take care of her, she bought this can of Xiamen's famous product – canned jackfruit – and gave it to Old Mother Xu as a post-illness appetizer. Old Mother Xu had never eaten this kind of thing in her old age, and she was reluctant to eat it even after being told to. Now, she decided to take it to give to her most beloved People's Liberation Army soldiers, but she still felt it wasn't enough and rushed to the street to buy five pieces of bread.
    At the same time, in the house next door, Old Mother Lin Zhu and her nine-year-old granddaughter Ya Zhen were picking cantaloupe (甜瓜) in the melon shed. She had planted this melon herself and watched it grow from a vine to a fruit. Some time ago, Old Mother Lin saw the People's Liberation Army soldiers sweating profusely under the scorching sun, carrying ammunition back and forth, and felt bad for them. She thought that her melons had grown and it would be great to send a few to the soldiers to quench their thirst and relieve the heat! Therefore, she diligently tended to the melon vine, getting up early every morning to water it and pour urine on it, urging it to grow quickly. A few days ago, Little Ya Zhen saw that the melons were ripe and clamored to eat them, but her grandmother told her that she was saving these melons for the People's Liberation Army soldiers to eat, and she obediently walked away. Now, the grandmother and granddaughter happily brought four cantaloupes.
    Then, the widowed and childless, sixty-four-year-old Ye Qian also came, bringing her only chicken, with red cloth strips tied to its claws. More than three months ago, she bought a small hen with the money she usually saved from her food expenses. It now weighed more than a pound. Originally, she planned to let it lay many eggs, and then use the eggs to exchange for lamp oil, matches, needles, and thread for household use. Now, seeing everyone competing to give the hard-working and meritorious soldiers the things that best expressed their feelings, she suddenly thought of this chicken. As soon as she got home, she fed it until it was full, preparing to give it to her loved ones.
    In just half an hour, all sorts of gifts arrived: cakes, bananas, pomelos, red eggs, vegetables, towels, soap, over ninety items in total, filling seven bamboo baskets. Who should be chosen as the representative? Old Mother Xu, Old Mother Lin, and Old Mother Ye all vied to personally deliver the gifts to the front lines. After discussion, Old Mother Xu Jin had just recovered from her illness and couldn't walk the mountain roads, so only the two old mothers and Team Leader Xu Suzhen and others went to the front lines.
    The representatives, carrying the warm feelings of the villagers, arrived at the barracks that were often in the line of fire. The company commander, political instructor, and soldiers all stood at the entrance of the barracks to welcome them. Old Mother Ye Qian handed her chicken to a soldier and said, "Child, this is just a small token of the old woman's heart. Eat it, nourish your body, and fight the Chiang bandit army even more bravely!" Then, the other representatives began to carry the gifts out one by one.
    Thus, a "scramble" of talking and laughing began. The representatives kept stuffing the gifts onto the soldiers, but the soldiers refused to accept them, pushing them back into the old mothers' hands. After pushing back and forth for a while, Company Commander Chai saw that the old mothers were about to get angry, so he had to tell everyone to accept them. He said: "We will never fail the expectations of the old mothers, and we will fight even more stubbornly, fiercely attacking the enemy and avenging all the suffering compatriots…"
    The old mothers happily said, "That's more like it!" Before leaving, the old mothers also looked everywhere for the soldiers' dirty clothes to wash, and even brought back a few wet clothes soaked in the washbasin.

    老妈妈的情意
    翁其华
    厦门市下井巷妇女支前服务队长许素珍从街道办事处回来，喜冲冲地告诉大家：为了祝贺前线的胜利，居委会准备派代表上阵地去慰问亲人……。话音未落人们就像一锅沸水一样欢腾起来了。
    “还能空手去见孩子们吗？”六十四岁的许进老大娘带嗔地问队长。
    “是呀！解放军叔叔日夜守卫海防，保卫我们过安乐日子，这回多少总该送点礼物去啊！”队长的女儿、小学三年级学生秀容说出了大伙的心里话。许素珍笑着说：“再过一个钟头，代表就得出发了，要送礼物的赶快去办吧！”
    这话刚完，通通通，屋里一下子就走空了。
    送些什么东西最能表示自己的心意呢？老大娘们心里都有数。
    许进老大娘快步走进后房，从厨顶上拿下一个菠萝蜜罐头来，小心地抹去上面的尘埃，把罐子擦得亮堂耀眼的，然后仔细抚摸着端详着，满意地笑了。提起这个罐头，有一段来历：一个多月前，老大娘生了一场病，胃口不好，两三天不思茶饭，身体更衰弱了。邻居国良嫂眼看老妈妈饭量减少了，她儿子整天在外面忙工作，少人侍候，就买了这罐厦门名产——菠萝蜜罐头，送给许大娘作为病后开胃补品。许大娘偌大年纪还没吃过这东西呢，几次要吃可又舍不得。现在，她决定拿去送给自己最心爱的解放军战士们，可是，她还嫌不足，又赶到街上买了五块面包。
    就在这同一时刻里，住在隔壁的林珠老妈妈和她的九岁的孙女亚贞正在瓜棚里采摘甜瓜，这株瓜是她亲手种下看着它长藤结瓜的。前些时候，林大妈看到解放军战士在炎热炙人的烈日下，汗流浃背地往返运送弹药，心里过意不去，想起自己种的甜瓜长大了，能捎几个给战士们止渴解暑多好呀！于是，她更加勤谨地侍弄这株甜瓜，大清早起来就到后园浇水、泼尿，催它赶快长大起来。前几天，小亚贞看到瓜熟了吵着要吃，老祖母告诉她留着这几条瓜给解放军战士吃的，她就乖乖地走开了。现在，祖孙俩高高兴兴地把四条甜瓜送来了。
    接着，孤寡户、六十四岁的叶乾老大娘也来了，她送来一只唯一的鸡，鸡爪儿还扎上了红布条呢。三个多月前，她把平时节省下的菜金买回了一只小母鸡，现在长到一斤多重了，原先划算让它下很多蛋，然后拿鸡蛋去换回灯油、火柴、针线当家用的，现在看到大家争先把最能表达自己心意的东西送给劳苦功高的战士们，她猛然想起了这只鸡，一回家就给它喂得饱饱的准备送给亲人了。
    不过半个钟头光景，各色礼物都到齐了，糕饼、香蕉、柚子、红蛋、蔬菜、毛巾、肥皂，大小九十多件，装了七个竹篮。选谁当代表呢？许大娘、林大娘、叶大娘都争着要亲自把礼物送到阵地去。大伙商量结果，许进老大娘久病初愈，走不了山路，只让两位老大娘跟许素珍队长等人上阵地去。
    代表们带着乡亲的盛情厚意，来到了经常出没在弹雨中的营房。连长、指导员和战士们全站在营房门口欢迎她们。叶乾老大娘把自己的鸡交给一个战士说：“孩子呀，这不过是老妈子的一点心意，你们吃了它，补养身体，更勇敢的打蒋贼军啊！”接着，别的代表就把礼物一件件往外搬。
    于是，一场连说带笑的“争夺战”就开始了。代表们一个劲地把一件件礼物往战士们身上塞，战士们说什么也不肯收，就一个劲儿往老大娘手里推。这么推来让去好一会，柴连长眼看老大娘们快生气了，只好叫大家收下。他说：“我们决不辜负老妈妈们的期望，一定更加顽强的战斗，狠狠地打击敌人，为所有受难同胞报仇。……”
    老大娘高兴地说：“这才像话！”临走，老妈妈们还到处寻找战士们换下的脏衣服，连浸在脸盆里几件湿的衣服也带了回来。
