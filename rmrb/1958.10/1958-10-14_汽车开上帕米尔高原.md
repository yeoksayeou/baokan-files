    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A newly opened highway from Kashgar in southern Xinjiang to the Pamir Plateau has been opened to traffic. The herders of the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, who live on the Pamir Plateau in the westernmost part of our country, greeted the arrival of the first batch of trucks loaded with supplies beside their tents with joy.
    The Kashgar-Taxkorgan highway is about 300 kilometers long, most of which is on the Pamir Plateau, thousands of meters above sea level, and it has to cross many glaciers, making the project extremely difficult. The road builders overcame the heavy snow and floods on the mountain, cut through mountains and crossed valleys, and completed this steep highway fifteen months ahead of schedule.
    Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County is one of the most remote counties in Xinjiang. Due to the obstruction of high mountains, transportation is very inconvenient, and the Tajik people have lived in the plateau almost all year round. After liberation, the People's Government organized some horse and camel transportation teams to transport food, cloth and other supplies for the herdsmen, but it took more than a month for a round trip.

    汽车开上帕米尔高原
    据新华社讯　从新疆南部喀什通到帕米尔高原上的一条新开辟的公路已经通车。聚居在我国最西部帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县牧民，莫不欢欣鼓舞地在自己的帐篷旁边迎接第一批满载物资的汽车的到来。
    喀什—塔什库尔干公路全长约三百公里，大部都在拔海几千公尺的帕米尔高原上，要翻越很多冰山，工程异常艰巨。筑路人员战胜了山上的大风雪和洪水，劈山越谷，提前十五个月修通了这条险峻的公路。
    塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县是新疆最偏僻的县份之一。由于高山的阻隔，交通十分不便，塔吉克族人民差不多终年深居在高原上。解放后，人民政府组织了一些马和骆驼的运输队，为牧民运送粮食和布匹等物资，但往来一趟要一个多月。
