    Editor's Note: Some time ago, mechanical workers created the advanced experience of "ants gnawing at bones," which solved the problem of insufficient large-scale processing equipment. Recently, some factories have created new experiences in using small equipment and indigenous methods to manufacture large castings and forgings. This is another significant creation in China's machinery industrial production. It solves the problem of insufficient production capacity for large castings and forgings and can provide "ants" with sufficient "bones." This experience can be summarized as: "transforming the large into the small, piecing the small into the large, substituting castings for forgings, and substituting iron for steel." Below, we introduce typical experiences in these four aspects.
    
    How Big a Frame Can Be Welded Together?

    (Our dispatch) When the Tangshan Machine Factory was manufacturing a 650 mm thin plate rolling mill, the staff cooperated with the Tangshan Steel Plant and used existing small-capacity smelting equipment to manufacture the frame, a large steel casting in the rolling mill, by welding.

    The frame is the largest blank in the rolling mill. The frame of the 650 mm rolling mill is 3,550 mm high and 2,300 mm wide, with a net weight of 14,500 kg. To manufacture it using regular methods requires an open-hearth furnace with a capacity of more than 20 tons for casting. The entire city of Tangshan does not have such large equipment, but the staff of the Tangshan Machine Factory created a method of transforming the large into the small and piecing the small into the large, dividing the frame into two pieces, casting them separately, and then welding them into a whole. In this way, the weight of each piece was still around ten tons. The capacity of the smelting equipment at the Tangshan Steel Plant, which was responsible for supplying the blanks, was still insufficient, so the plant used several small steelmaking furnaces to cast the blanks together in order to make the required steel castings. After obtaining the blanks, the Tangshan Machine Factory, with the joint efforts of veteran welders and technicians, finally welded a complete frame.

    编者按　前些时候，机械工人们创造了“蚂蚁啃骨头”的先进经验，解决了大型加工设备不足的问题。最近，有些工厂又创造了用小设备、土办法制造大型铸件和锻件的新经验。这是我国机械工业生产中的又一重大创造。它解决了大型铸锻件生产能力不足的问题，可以给“蚂蚁”供应充足的“骨头”。这种经验归纳起来是：“化大为小，拼小成大，以铸代锻，以铁代钢”。下面，我们介绍了这四个方面的典型经验。
    多大的机架也能焊接起来
    本报讯　唐山机器厂在制造六百五十公厘薄板轧钢机的时候，职工们与唐山钢厂合作，利用现有的小容量冶炼设备，以焊接方法制造成轧钢机中的大铸钢件——机架。
    机架是轧钢机中最大的毛坯，六百五十公厘轧钢机的机架高达三千五百五十公厘，宽二千三百公厘，净重一万四千五百公斤，用正规的方法制造需要容量在二十吨以上的平炉才能浇注。整个唐山市没有这样大的设备，但唐山机器厂的职工创造了化大为小、拼小成大的方法，将机架分为二片，分别铸造出来，再焊为整体。这样每片的重量还在十吨左右，负责供应毛坯的唐山钢厂的冶炼设备的容量还是不够，这个厂就利用几个小的炼钢炉一起浇注了毛坯，才制成所需的铸钢件。唐山机器厂在取得毛坯后，在老焊接工人和技术人员共同努力下，终于焊成一个完整的机架。
