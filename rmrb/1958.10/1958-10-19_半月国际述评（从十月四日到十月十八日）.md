Semi-Monthly International Review
(From October 4th to October 18th)

	Imperialism is After All Imperialism

The United States single-handedly created the war crisis in the Taiwan Strait, putting itself in an unprecedentedly isolated and embarrassing position. Our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai issued a "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" on October 6th, announcing a seven-day suspension of shelling and suggesting that the Taiwan authorities hold peace talks; on October 13th, our Ministry of National Defense issued another order to suspend shelling for another two weeks. This is a major measure taken by our country to liberate Taiwan, on the one hand, issuing a lofty patriotic call to the military and civilians in Taiwan, suggesting holding peaceful negotiations to end the civil war; on the other hand, reiterating that the Chinese people's own problems can only be solved by the Chinese themselves, and no American interference in China's internal affairs is allowed. The Chinese people are determined to recover Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu entirely, complete the reunification of the motherland, and the American aggressors must get out of the Taiwan Strait area. As for the tense situation between China and the United States caused by the US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, we have always advocated resolving it through Sino-US talks.

The proclamations and orders of our Ministry of National Defense have aroused warm welcome among the vast number of military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and have also received unanimous support from fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Asian, African countries, and fair-minded public opinion around the world are also entirely on our side. President Nasser said: Liberating Taiwan and coastal islands such as Jinmen is China's legitimate right, and the people of the United Arab Republic support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is supporting justice, righteousness, and the cause of peace. The head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly, Menon, also said: The Taiwan issue should be resolved by the Chinese themselves, and American troops should withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. The recent National Convention for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Prohibiting Nuclear Armament held in Japan also passed a resolution demanding that American troops withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. According to the British Information Service, the proclamation of our Ministry of National Defense "was generally welcomed by UN diplomats, especially those from non-aligned countries." Even within the United States, the voices of dissatisfaction and opposition to the US intervention policy have risen even higher, and the infighting within the US ruling clique has intensified. Although the US government has loudly called on the Democratic and Republican parties to maintain "bipartisan diplomacy," it has still failed to "prevent" this "partisan debate."

The US government is caught in a dilemma, attempting to continue to implement its "ceasefire" trick: on the one hand, it stubbornly insists that our suspension of shelling meets the US demand for a "ceasefire" and vainly hopes to force us to implement a "permanent ceasefire" and a "reliable ceasefire"; on the other hand, it is using the method of "reducing troops and increasing firepower" to "persuade" the Chiang Kai-shek troops to withdraw part of their forces from Jinmen, feigning a posture of "reconciliation." This trick has already been exposed by Dulles himself in his speech on the 14th. It turns out that the so-called reduction of Chiang's troops in Jinmen is merely to continue to strengthen military deployments in order to "most effectively and most forcefully use the existing troops," and they can be sent back immediately if necessary. Dulles also blatantly expressed the US ambition to directly control our coastal islands, openly saying that even if the Taiwan authorities agreed to hand over these islands, the United States would not agree. This nakedly exposed the hideous face of the American aggressors.

At the same time, although the United States has stopped escorting ships, its naval and air forces continue to violate our territorial waters and airspace, having done so more than thirty times. American modern weapons, cannons, tanks, etc., continue to be shipped to the Taiwan Strait area in a steady stream. It has also announced that it will supply the Chiang Kai-shek clique with "Nike-Hercules" missiles and train missile units for the Chiang army group. The commander of the US Marine Corps, Pate, clamored that the US Marine Corps in Taiwan and other places in the Western Pacific are in a state of "ready to conduct any type of war focusing on amphibious warfare."

Facts have once again educated the people of the world to recognize that imperialism is after all imperialism, and it will never automatically abandon its aggressive plans. The Chinese people and the people of the world must persist in fighting to force the American aggressors to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to the very end.

	Get Out of the Middle East

The UN General Assembly's emergency session passed a resolution that US and British troops must withdraw from the Middle East, which was almost two months ago. The United States played many tricks to delay the withdrawal of troops, but under the demands of the new Lebanese government and the pressure of world opinion, it finally had no choice but to announce that US troops would completely withdraw from Lebanon by the end of October. Britain, which colluded with the United States, also declared that it would withdraw its troops from Jordan.

The US government has constantly put forward conditions for withdrawing its troops. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld said in his report to the General Assembly on September 30 that the United States agreed to complete the withdrawal of US troops by the end of October, but on the condition that "the situation regarding Lebanon's international security continues to improve." Dulles also reiterated in his speech at the UN General Assembly that he wanted to establish a so-called "UN peacekeeping force," attempting to continue to implement military occupation of Lebanon in a disguised form. Until October 8, when the United States formally announced its withdrawal, it still attached a condition: "unless there is an unforeseen situation." At the same time, the United States has been doing its best to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, creating a chaotic situation to find excuses for delaying its withdrawal.

On September 24, the day after Shehab took office as president, the armed forces of the Chamoun group, under the cover of US troops and tanks, created a bloody incident in Beirut, launching an attack on the rebel forces and forcing residents to implement a "general strike," killing, arson, kidnapping, looting, disrupting traffic, and burning vehicles. According to the recent confessions of conspirators arrested for opposing the Karami government, the Chamoun group, with US support, attempted to launch an armed coup in Lebanon. Not only that, the United States also openly intervened, carrying out blatant interference. On September 30, the US ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, actually demanded the reorganization of the Karami government, giving four ministerial seats in the cabinet to the Chamoun group, and expanding the number of members of parliament in order to forcibly install more Chamoun group members into parliament. When this request was rejected, the United States even more directly used military threats, dispatching thirty-seven tanks to occupy the Basta district and other areas in Beirut previously controlled by the rebel forces opposing Chamoun, and conducting military exercises on nearby beaches, firing into the air and launching rockets, attempting to crush the Karami government. But Karami received the firm support of the Lebanese National Front, various political parties, and the people. On the 14th, Karami had already reorganized a four-member cabinet, including Phalangist leader Gemayel. Karami's new cabinet reiterated that it would pursue a "policy of neutrality and friendship with all Arab countries" and that US troops should withdraw from Lebanon.

The US conspiracy to delay the withdrawal of troops has suffered a shameful defeat. While it fiercely invaded the Middle East and was forced to get out of the Middle East, it is still throwing its weight around in Lebanon and interfering in its internal affairs. This once again exposed the ugly face of US imperialism in front of the whole world.

	Blocking the Road to Fascism

De Gaulle, relying on bayonets, violence, and lies, relying on the betrayal of the republican system by the so-called "middle" parties of the bourgeoisie, especially the right-wing forces of the Socialist Party, forced the dictatorial "constitution" on the French people in the "referendum" on September 28.

After the "constitution" was passed, the De Gaulle government immediately set about planning the new parliamentary elections in November, attempting to replace the bourgeois democratic republic with the "Fifth Republic," which is moving towards fascist dictatorship, while also planning to salvage the collapse of the colonial empire by strengthening the colonial war in Algeria. De Gaulle has promulgated three fascist decrees, frantically clamoring to "take action" against the French Communist Party, preparing to persecute the French democratic and progressive forces, and intensify the suppression of the national liberation movements in Algeria and other French territories.

On October 3, De Gaulle once again clamored in Algeria: "Algeria is forever linked with France," and threatened the Algerian people with war in a vicious manner. The De Gaulle government adopted a frenziedly hostile attitude towards the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. It also threatened the Republic of Guinea, which declared its independence, with stopping "aid" and other threats. These fully demonstrate De Gaulle's intention to rely on fascist rule and intensify colonial wars to maintain the decadent and reactionary rule of the French monopoly capitalist group.

However, De Gaulle's "victory" in the "referendum" will not last long. In France, De Gaulle faces a powerful working class, a force composed of 4.6 million French people who bravely cast their opposition votes, ringing the alarm, mobilizing all the French people to abandon illusions, and actively participate in the anti-fascist struggle. Overseas, De Gaulle is faced with an unstoppable torrent demanding independence. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has greatly encouraged the Algerian people's armed struggle to break free from colonial rule. Guinea's declaration of independence after the "referendum" was another slap in the face to De Gaulle. Even French Minister of State Jacquinot admitted that the French "referendum" "did not solve France's problems." The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" wrote even more worriedly: "If he (referring to De Gaulle) cannot solve France's major problems, then the whole country will quickly turn against him." Now, the loyal sons of the French people, the heroic fighters for the cause of French democracy and progress—the French Communist Party—are loudly calling on the people to hold high the banner of democracy and freedom and continue the struggle to block the road to fascism.

	Forced Into a Predicament

The US ruling clique, which is everywhere in a passive and isolated position, has also been forced into a predicament by the struggle of the people of all countries to strive for a cessation of nuclear weapons testing on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing. The US and British governments have had to play a double game, on the one hand, expressing their agreement to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on stopping nuclear weapons testing on the 31st of this month and announcing that they will stop testing for one year from the first day of the start of negotiations; on the other hand, they continue to use various methods to obstruct the realization of stopping nuclear weapons testing.

As early as March 31 of this year, the Soviet Union announced its unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing and expressed the hope that the United States and Britain would follow the Soviet Union's example. However, the United States and Britain intensified a series of unprecedentedly large-scale nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific region, seriously threatening the lives of the people of various countries in the region. For the sake of its own security and the interests of world peace, the Soviet Union had no choice but to announce the resumption of nuclear weapons testing, but at the same time, it stated that it would continue to strive for the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet Union suggested that the meeting scheduled to begin in Geneva on the 31st of this month be held at the level of foreign ministers in order to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. At the 13th UN General Assembly, the Soviet delegation also proposed a proposal for the immediate cessation of all nuclear weapons testing, which was supported by many national delegations. The Indian delegation also put forward a proposal demanding the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

However, the US government still has no sincerity in dealing with the Soviet proposals. At the UN General Assembly, the US delegation insisted on the old method of discussing disarmament issues in a package, attempting to submerge the urgent issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing in the endless debates of some other disarmament issues that cannot be resolved temporarily, and cannot be resolved. The US delegation also gathered the delegations of sixteen countries, including Britain, and jointly put forward a proposal on the issue of disarmament that was almost devoid of specific content, in which the part on stopping nuclear weapons testing only mentioned in vague terms striving for an "early" resolution of this issue. This more clearly shows how hypocritical the US posture of announcing that it will suspend nuclear weapons testing for one year at the beginning of the Geneva conference is. The "New York Times" has already inadvertently exposed this secret. This newspaper said that the reason why the United States stipulated a period of one year is because "it takes twelve to twenty-four months to carefully study the results of large-scale tests," that is to say, the one year of stopping testing will be exactly the time needed to prepare for the next test. The true face of the United States' unwillingness to permanently stop nuclear weapons testing has been exposed.

    半月国际述评
    （从十月四日到十月十八日）
    帝国主义到底是帝国主义
    美国一手制造了台湾海峡地区的战争危机，使它自己陷于空前孤立和狼狈境地。我国防部长彭德怀于10月6日发表“告台湾同胞书”，宣布暂停炮击七天，建议台湾当局举行和谈；13日我国防部又发布命令再停炮击两星期。这是我国为解放台湾采取的重大措施，一方面向台湾军民发出了崇高的爱国主义号召，建议举行和平谈判来结束内战；一方面重申中国人自己的问题只能由中国人自己来解决，中国的内政不容美国干涉。中国人民决心整个地收复台澎金马，完成祖国统一，美国侵略者必须从台湾海峡地区滚回去。至于中美之间由于美国占领我国领土台湾所造成的紧张局势，我们一贯主张经过中美会谈，来求得解决。
    我国防部的文告和命令，在台澎金马广大军民同胞中引起了热烈的欢迎，也得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营兄弟国家的一致支持。亚非国家和全世界的公正舆论，也完全站在我们这一边。纳赛尔总统说：解放台湾和金门等沿海岛屿是中国的合法权利，阿拉伯联合共和国人民支持中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是支持公理、正义和和平事业。印度出席联大代表团团长梅农也说：台湾问题应由中国人自己解决，美国军队应撤出台湾海峡地区。日本最近举行的打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会通过决议，也要求美国军队撤出台湾海峡地区。据英国新闻处报道，我国防部文告“受到联合国外交人士特别是不参加集团国家人士的普遍欢迎。”就在美国国内，不满和反对美国干涉政策的声浪，也更加高涨，美国统治集团内部的争吵日剧，尽管美国政府大声疾呼地要求民主党和共和党保持“两党外交”，但仍未能“阻止”这种“党派辩论”。
    美国政府陷入了进退两难的困境，企图继续施展它的“停火”诡计：一方面硬把我国暂停炮击的行动说成是符合美国“停火”的要求，并妄想迫使我实行“永久停火”“可靠的停火”；另方面正在以“削减兵力而增加火力”的方法“说服”蒋介石军队从金门撤退一部分，伪装“和解”姿态。这个骗局已经由杜勒斯自己在14日的谈话中揭穿了，原来所谓减少金门蒋军，不过是为的继续加强军事部署，以便“最有效地和最有力地使用现有军队”，而且一旦需要，就可以马上派回去。杜勒斯并且露骨地表示了美国要直接控制我沿海岛屿的野心，公然说，即使台湾当局同意交出这些岛屿，美国也不会同意。这就赤裸裸地暴露了美国侵略者的狰狞面目。
    与此同时，美国虽然停止了护航，但它的海空军却继续侵犯我领海领空先后已达三十多次。美国现代武器、大炮、坦克等继续源源运抵台湾海峡地区。并且宣布将供应蒋介石集团以“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹，为蒋军集团训练导弹部队。美国海军陆战队司令培特叫嚣，美国在台湾和西太平洋其他地方的海军陆战队，已处于“准备进行任何类型的着重于两栖战的战争”的状态。
    事实又一次教育了全世界人民，认清楚帝国主义到底是帝国主义，它是绝不会自动放弃它的侵略计划的。中国人民和全世界人民必须坚持为迫使美国侵略者停止干涉中国内政，把美国武装力量撤出台湾和台湾海峡斗争到底。
          从中东滚出去
    联合国大会紧急会议通过美英军队必须撤出中东的决议，快到两个月了。美国玩弄了许多拖延撤军的诡计，但在黎巴嫩新政府的要求和世界舆论的压力下，它终于不得不宣布，美军将于10月底以前从黎巴嫩全部撤退。与美国狼狈为奸的英国，也声言要从约旦撤军。
    美国政府曾不断地提出撤军的条件。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德9月30日在对联大提出的报告里说，美国同意在10月底完成美军撤退的工作，但要以“黎巴嫩的国际安全方面的局势继续改善”为条件。杜勒斯在联合国大会会议上的发言中还再次要求建立所谓“联合国和平部队”，企图变相地继续对黎巴嫩实行军事占领。直到10月8日美国正式宣布撤军的同时，仍然附加了一个条件：“除非出现无法预料的局势”。与此同时，美国竭力干涉黎巴嫩的内政，制造混乱局势，为它拖延撤军找寻借口。
    在谢哈布就任总统的第二天，9月24日，夏蒙集团的武装部队，就在美国军队和坦克的掩护下，在贝鲁特制造流血事件，向起义部队发动进攻，并强迫居民实行“总罢工”，杀人放火，绑架抢劫，破坏交通，焚毁车辆。据最近被捕的反对卡拉米政府的阴谋分子供认，夏蒙集团在美国支持下，企图在黎巴嫩发动武装政变。不仅这样，美国还公开插手，进行明目张胆的干涉。9月30日，美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克竟然要求改组卡拉米政府，把内阁中的四个部长席位让给夏蒙集团，并且扩大议会的议员名额，以便强行把更多的夏蒙集团分子安插到议会中去。当这个要求遭到拒绝后，美国更直接使用军事威胁，出动三十七辆坦克占领贝鲁特市内以前由反对夏蒙的起义部队所控制的巴斯塔区等地区，并在附近海滩上进行军事演习，向空中开火和放射火箭，企图压垮卡拉米政府。但卡拉米受到黎巴嫩民族阵线、各政党和人民群众的坚决支持。14日，已经由卡拉米再次组成四人内阁，其中包括长枪党主席杰马耶勒。卡拉米新内阁重申，将奉行“中立和同所有阿拉伯国家友好的政策”，并要美军撤出黎巴嫩。
    美国拖延撤军的阴谋，已经遭到了可耻的失败。它在凶恶地侵略中东，被迫滚出中东之前，仍然在黎巴嫩作威作福，干涉内政，这在全世界面前，又一次暴露了美帝国主义的丑恶面目。
        堵塞法西斯的道路
    戴高乐依靠刺刀、暴力和谎言，依靠资产阶级所谓“中间”党派特别是社会党右翼势力对共和制的背叛，在9月28日“公民投票”中，把独裁“宪法”强加在法国人民身上了。
    戴高乐政府在“宪法”通过后，立即着手筹划11月的新议会选举，企图以走向法西斯专政的“第五共和国”来代替资产阶级民主共和制度，同时打算以加强对阿尔及利亚的殖民战争来挽救殖民帝国的瓦解。戴高乐已颁布了三项法西斯法令，疯狂地叫嚣要对法国共产党“采取行动”，准备迫害法国民主进步力量，加紧镇压阿尔及利亚和其他法国属地的民族解放运动。
    10月3日戴高乐在阿尔及利亚再次叫嚣：“阿尔及利亚同法国永远连结在一起”，并穷凶极恶地以战争威吓阿尔及利亚人民。戴高乐政府对于阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，采取疯狂的敌视态度。还以停止“援助”等等威胁手段，对付宣布了独立的几内亚共和国。这些充分表明了戴高乐打算依靠法西斯统治，依靠加剧殖民战争，来为法国垄断资本集团保持腐朽的反动统治。
    然而，戴高乐在“公民投票”中取得的“胜利”是长久不了的，在法国，戴高乐面对着强大的工人阶级，由四百六十万英勇地投了反对票的法国人民所组成的一支力量敲起警钟，动员全体法国人民丢掉幻想，积极参加反法西斯斗争。在海外，戴高乐面对的是无可遏止的要求独立的洪流。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，大大鼓舞了阿尔及利亚人民摆脱殖民统治的武装斗争。几内亚在“公民投票”后宣布独立，是对戴高乐的另一当头棒喝。连法国国务部长雅基诺也承认，法国的“公民投票”“并没有解决法国的问题”。法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”更是忧心忡忡地写道：“如果他（指戴高乐）无法解决法国的各项主要问题，那么全国会很快地转过来反对他。”现在，法国人民的忠实儿子、法国民主进步事业的英勇战士——法国共产党，响亮地号召人民高举民主自由的旗帜，继续进行斗争，堵塞法西斯的道路。
            迫入了窘境
    处处陷于被动和孤立的美国统治集团，在停止核武器试验的问题上，也被各国人民争取停止核武器试验的斗争，迫入了窘境。美英两国政府不得不玩弄两面手法，一方面表示同意在本月31日开始同苏联举行关于停止核武器试验的谈判，并宣布将从开始谈判的第一天起停止试验一年；另一方面却继续使用各种手法，阻挠停止核武器试验的实现。
    早在今年3月31日，苏联就宣布了单方面停止核武器试验，并且表示希望美英效法苏联的榜样。可是，美英两国竟加紧在太平洋地区进行了空前规模的一系列核武器试验，严重地威胁了这一地区各国人民的生命安全。苏联为了自身的安全和世界和平的利益，不得不宣布恢复核武器试验，但同时表示仍将继续努力争取立即普遍永久地停止核武器试验。苏联建议订于本月31日在日内瓦开始的会议在外交部长级上举行，以便在最短期内达成协议。在十三届联大上，苏联代表团又提出了一项立即停止一切核武器试验的提案，得到了许多国家代表团的支持。印度代表团也提出了一个要求立即停止核武器试验的提案。
    但是，美国政府对待苏联建议仍然毫无诚意。美国代表团在联大坚持要一揽子讨论裁军问题的老办法，企图把停止核武器试验的迫切问题淹没在其他一些暂时不能解决的裁军问题的无休止的争论里，而得不到解决。美国代表团还纠集了英国等十六个国家的代表团共同提出了一个几乎是毫无具体内容的裁军问题提案，其中关于停止核武器试验部分只是空洞地提到争取“早日”解决这一问题。这就更清楚地表明美国宣布要在日内瓦会议开始时暂停核武器试验一年的姿态，是多么虚伪。“纽约时报”早已无意中戳穿了这个秘密。这家报纸说，美国所以规定以一年为期，是因为“为了仔细地研究大规模试验的结果，需要十二个月到二十四个月的时间”，这就是说，停止试验的一年将恰恰是准备进行下一次试验所需要的时间。美国不愿永远停止核武器试验的真面目已暴露无遗了。
