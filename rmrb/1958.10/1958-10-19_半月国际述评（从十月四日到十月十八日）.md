Semi-Monthly International Review
(From October 4th to October 18th)

	Imperialism is After All Imperialism

The United States single-handedly created the war crisis in the Taiwan Strait, putting itself in an unprecedentedly isolated and embarrassing position. Our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai issued a "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" on October 6th, announcing a seven-day suspension of shelling and suggesting that the Taiwan authorities hold peace talks; on October 13th, our Ministry of National Defense issued another order to suspend shelling for another two weeks. This is a major measure taken by our country to liberate Taiwan, on the one hand, issuing a lofty patriotic call to the military and civilians in Taiwan, suggesting holding peaceful negotiations to end the civil war; on the other hand, reiterating that the Chinese people's own problems can only be solved by the Chinese themselves, and no American interference in China's internal affairs is allowed. The Chinese people are determined to recover Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu entirely, complete the reunification of the motherland, and the American aggressors must get out of the Taiwan Strait area. As for the tense situation between China and the United States caused by the US occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, we have always advocated resolving it through Sino-US talks.

The proclamations and orders of our Ministry of National Defense have aroused warm welcome among the vast number of military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and have also received unanimous support from fraternal countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Asian, African countries, and fair-minded public opinion around the world are also entirely on our side. President Nasser said: Liberating Taiwan and coastal islands such as Jinmen is China's legitimate right, and the people of the United Arab Republic support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is supporting justice, righteousness, and the cause of peace. The head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly, Menon, also said: The Taiwan issue should be resolved by the Chinese themselves, and American troops should withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. The recent National Convention for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Prohibiting Nuclear Armament held in Japan also passed a resolution demanding that American troops withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. According to the British Information Service, the proclamation of our Ministry of National Defense "was generally welcomed by UN diplomats, especially those from non-aligned countries." Even within the United States, the voices of dissatisfaction and opposition to the US intervention policy have risen even higher, and the infighting within the US ruling clique has intensified. Although the US government has loudly called on the Democratic and Republican parties to maintain "bipartisan diplomacy," it has still failed to "prevent" this "partisan debate."

The US government is caught in a dilemma, attempting to continue to implement its "ceasefire" trick: on the one hand, it stubbornly insists that our suspension of shelling meets the US demand for a "ceasefire" and vainly hopes to force us to implement a "permanent ceasefire" and a "reliable ceasefire"; on the other hand, it is using the method of "reducing troops and increasing firepower" to "persuade" the Chiang Kai-shek troops to withdraw part of their forces from Jinmen, feigning a posture of "reconciliation." This trick has already been exposed by Dulles himself in his speech on the 14th. It turns out that the so-called reduction of Chiang's troops in Jinmen is merely to continue to strengthen military deployments in order to "most effectively and most forcefully use the existing troops," and they can be sent back immediately if necessary. Dulles also blatantly expressed the US ambition to directly control our coastal islands, openly saying that even if the Taiwan authorities agreed to hand over these islands, the United States would not agree. This nakedly exposed the hideous face of the American aggressors.

At the same time, although the United States has stopped escorting ships, its naval and air forces continue to violate our territorial waters and airspace, having done so more than thirty times. American modern weapons, cannons, tanks, etc., continue to be shipped to the Taiwan Strait area in a steady stream. It has also announced that it will supply the Chiang Kai-shek clique with "Nike-Hercules" missiles and train missile units for the Chiang army group. The commander of the US Marine Corps, Pate, clamored that the US Marine Corps in Taiwan and other places in the Western Pacific are in a state of "ready to conduct any type of war focusing on amphibious warfare."

Facts have once again educated the people of the world to recognize that imperialism is after all imperialism, and it will never automatically abandon its aggressive plans. The Chinese people and the people of the world must persist in fighting to force the American aggressors to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to the very end.

	Get Out of the Middle East

The UN General Assembly's emergency session passed a resolution that US and British troops must withdraw from the Middle East, which was almost two months ago. The United States played many tricks to delay the withdrawal of troops, but under the demands of the new Lebanese government and the pressure of world opinion, it finally had no choice but to announce that US troops would completely withdraw from Lebanon by the end of October. Britain, which colluded with the United States, also declared that it would withdraw its troops from Jordan.

The US government has constantly put forward conditions for withdrawing its troops. UN Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld said in his report to the General Assembly on September 30 that the United States agreed to complete the withdrawal of US troops by the end of October, but on the condition that "the situation regarding Lebanon's international security continues to improve." Dulles also reiterated in his speech at the UN General Assembly that he wanted to establish a so-called "UN peacekeeping force," attempting to continue to implement military occupation of Lebanon in a disguised form. Until October 8, when the United States formally announced its withdrawal, it still attached a condition: "unless there is an unforeseen situation." At the same time, the United States has been doing its best to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, creating a chaotic situation to find excuses for delaying its withdrawal.

On September 24, the day after Shehab took office as president, the armed forces of the Chamoun group, under the cover of US troops and tanks, created a bloody incident in Beirut, launching an attack on the rebel forces and forcing residents to implement a "general strike," killing, arson, kidnapping, looting, disrupting traffic, and burning vehicles. According to the recent confessions of conspirators arrested for opposing the Karami government, the Chamoun group, with US support, attempted to launch an armed coup in Lebanon. Not only that, the United States also openly intervened, carrying out blatant interference. On September 30, the US ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, actually demanded the reorganization of the Karami government, giving four ministerial seats in the cabinet to the Chamoun group, and expanding the number of members of parliament in order to forcibly install more Chamoun group members into parliament. When this request was rejected, the United States even more directly used military threats, dispatching thirty-seven tanks to occupy the Basta district and other areas in Beirut previously controlled by the rebel forces opposing Chamoun, and conducting military exercises on nearby beaches, firing into the air and launching rockets, attempting to crush the Karami government. But Karami received the firm support of the Lebanese National Front, various political parties, and the people. On the 14th, Karami had already reorganized a four-member cabinet, including Phalangist leader Gemayel. Karami's new cabinet reiterated that it would pursue a "policy of neutrality and friendship with all Arab countries" and that US troops should withdraw from Lebanon.

The US conspiracy to delay the withdrawal of troops has suffered a shameful defeat. While it fiercely invaded the Middle East and was forced to get out of the Middle East, it is still throwing its weight around in Lebanon and interfering in its internal affairs. This once again exposed the ugly face of US imperialism in front of the whole world.

	Blocking the Road to Fascism

De Gaulle, relying on bayonets, violence, and lies, relying on the betrayal of the republican system by the so-called "middle" parties of the bourgeoisie, especially the right-wing forces of the Socialist Party, forced the dictatorial "constitution" on the French people in the "referendum" on September 28.

After the "constitution" was passed, the De Gaulle government immediately set about planning the new parliamentary elections in November, attempting to replace the bourgeois democratic republic with the "Fifth Republic," which is moving towards fascist dictatorship, while also planning to salvage the collapse of the colonial empire by strengthening the colonial war in Algeria. De Gaulle has promulgated three fascist decrees, frantically clamoring to "take action" against the French Communist Party, preparing to persecute the French democratic and progressive forces, and intensify the suppression of the national liberation movements in Algeria and other French territories.

On October 3, De Gaulle once again clamored in Algeria: "Algeria is forever linked with France," and threatened the Algerian people with war in a vicious manner. The De Gaulle government adopted a frenziedly hostile attitude towards the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. It also threatened the Republic of Guinea, which declared its independence, with stopping "aid" and other threats. These fully demonstrate De Gaulle's intention to rely on fascist rule and intensify colonial wars to maintain the decadent and reactionary rule of the French monopoly capitalist group.

However, De Gaulle's "victory" in the "referendum" will not last long. In France, De Gaulle faces a powerful working class, a force composed of 4.6 million French people who bravely cast their opposition votes, ringing the alarm, mobilizing all the French people to abandon illusions, and actively participate in the anti-fascist struggle. Overseas, De Gaulle is faced with an unstoppable torrent demanding independence. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic has greatly encouraged the Algerian people's armed struggle to break free from colonial rule. Guinea's declaration of independence after the "referendum" was another slap in the face to De Gaulle. Even French Minister of State Jacquinot admitted that the French "referendum" "did not solve France's problems." The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" wrote even more worriedly: "If he (referring to De Gaulle) cannot solve France's major problems, then the whole country will quickly turn against him." Now, the loyal sons of the French people, the heroic fighters for the cause of French democracy and progress‚Äîthe French Communist Party‚Äîare loudly calling on the people to hold high the banner of democracy and freedom and continue the struggle to block the road to fascism.

	Forced Into a Predicament

The US ruling clique, which is everywhere in a passive and isolated position, has also been forced into a predicament by the struggle of the people of all countries to strive for a cessation of nuclear weapons testing on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing. The US and British governments have had to play a double game, on the one hand, expressing their agreement to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on stopping nuclear weapons testing on the 31st of this month and announcing that they will stop testing for one year from the first day of the start of negotiations; on the other hand, they continue to use various methods to obstruct the realization of stopping nuclear weapons testing.

As early as March 31 of this year, the Soviet Union announced its unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing and expressed the hope that the United States and Britain would follow the Soviet Union's example. However, the United States and Britain intensified a series of unprecedentedly large-scale nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific region, seriously threatening the lives of the people of various countries in the region. For the sake of its own security and the interests of world peace, the Soviet Union had no choice but to announce the resumption of nuclear weapons testing, but at the same time, it stated that it would continue to strive for the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet Union suggested that the meeting scheduled to begin in Geneva on the 31st of this month be held at the level of foreign ministers in order to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. At the 13th UN General Assembly, the Soviet delegation also proposed a proposal for the immediate cessation of all nuclear weapons testing, which was supported by many national delegations. The Indian delegation also put forward a proposal demanding the immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

However, the US government still has no sincerity in dealing with the Soviet proposals. At the UN General Assembly, the US delegation insisted on the old method of discussing disarmament issues in a package, attempting to submerge the urgent issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing in the endless debates of some other disarmament issues that cannot be resolved temporarily, and cannot be resolved. The US delegation also gathered the delegations of sixteen countries, including Britain, and jointly put forward a proposal on the issue of disarmament that was almost devoid of specific content, in which the part on stopping nuclear weapons testing only mentioned in vague terms striving for an "early" resolution of this issue. This more clearly shows how hypocritical the US posture of announcing that it will suspend nuclear weapons testing for one year at the beginning of the Geneva conference is. The "New York Times" has already inadvertently exposed this secret. This newspaper said that the reason why the United States stipulated a period of one year is because "it takes twelve to twenty-four months to carefully study the results of large-scale tests," that is to say, the one year of stopping testing will be exactly the time needed to prepare for the next test. The true face of the United States' unwillingness to permanently stop nuclear weapons testing has been exposed.
