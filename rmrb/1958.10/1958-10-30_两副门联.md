Lin Shibu A: I went to Tiananmen Square yesterday to welcome the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers. Did you go?
	B: How could I not go to welcome the Volunteers? We even put up a decorated archway at the entrance of our alley.
	A: That's quite lively. Were there couplets on the archway?
	B: How could there not be couplets? I even wrote the characters myself.
	A: What's the first line?
	B: "Defeated the enemy, helped our friends."
	A: The second line?
	B: "Protected the motherland, saved peace."
	A: Is there a horizontal inscription?
	B: "Eternal Merit"!
	A: Good!
	B: After writing that one, I was on a roll, so I wrote another one.
	A: Also to be posted on the archway?
	B: No. I thought that while the Volunteers gloriously returned home, the American aggressor troops were still赖 (lai: stubbornly) staying in South Korea, so we should send them a couplet as well.
	A: Right! What's the first line of this one?
	B: "Having lost the battle, what's the use of賴 (lai: stubbornly staying)? Rolling away is the best plan;"
	A: The second line?
	B: "Crying is not right, laughing is not right, hard to step down."
	A: The horizontal inscription?
	B: "Self-inflicted suffering!"
	A: This door couplet is good, but where are you going to post it?
	B: On the front gate of the White House!

    两副门联（小相声）
  　林世步甲：昨天上天安门前去欢迎了志愿军代表团。您去了吗？乙：欢迎志愿军还能不去？我们胡同口还搭了个彩门哩。甲：那倒够热闹的。那彩门上可有对联？乙：没有对联还像话？字还是我写的呢。甲：那上联是：乙：“打败了敌人，帮助了朋友。”甲：下联？乙：“保卫了祖国，拯救了和平。”甲：可有横批？乙：“功垂不朽”！甲：好！乙：写罢了这一副，我这劲儿上来了，接着又写一副。甲：也是贴在彩门上的？乙：不。我想志愿军光荣凯旋回国，美国侵略军却还赖在南朝鲜不走，
    总得也送上一副对联才好。甲：对！这一副的上联是：乙：“打已输，赖何用，滚为上计；”甲：下联？乙：“哭不是，笑不是，难以下台。”甲：横批？乙：“自作自受！”甲：这副门联好是好，可你往哪儿贴去？乙：贴在白宫大门口！
