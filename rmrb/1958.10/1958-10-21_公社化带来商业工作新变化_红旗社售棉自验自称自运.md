Communization Brings New Changes to Commercial Work
    Red Flag Commune Sells Cotton with Self-Inspection, Self-Weighing, and Self-Transportation

    (Our Dispatch from Jinan, October 20) The Red Flag People's Commune in Linqing County, Shandong Province, has unified the arrangement of labor and adopted advanced methods of cotton sales, including self-inspection of grades, self-weighing, and self-transportation, ensuring that both production and cotton sales are not delayed. This advanced experience is currently being widely promoted throughout the province.

    The Red Flag People's Commune has achieved bumper harvests of both grain and cotton this year. The yield of seed cotton is expected to reach two thousand catties per mu, an increase of 5.6 times compared to last year. To ensure the timely completion of cotton picking and sales tasks, 240 full-time cotton picking teams were organized. Two hundred vehicles of various types, four hundred head of livestock, and four hundred commune members were assigned specifically to transport and sell the cotton, achieving the goal of picking, selling, and transporting as the cotton matures.

    This commune has also pioneered a set of advanced experiences in cotton sales based on “three selfs.” From cotton grade inspection and weighing to delivery to the processing plant, everything is handled by the commune itself. This not only saves a large amount of manpower and materials but also greatly shortens the turnaround time for cotton sales, fully complying with the state's policy of "fast collection and increased collection," and is also very beneficial to the commune itself. According to the commune's estimate, the total cotton production of the commune this year will be 150 million catties of seed cotton, and the adoption of the "three selfs" cotton sales method will save 150,000 labor days and animal labor days each.

    At the beginning of implementing the "three selfs" cotton sales method, the Red Flag Commune also encountered some ideological obstacles. For example, cadres worried that without technicians and poor equipment conditions, they would not be able to do a good job; they worried that the masses' political and ideological level was not high, and they were afraid that they would not be able to serve the country well and affect the commune's reputation; they disliked the trouble and were afraid of being held responsible if problems arose. In order to unify thinking, the commune party committee first convened three types of meetings: cadres, technicians, and the masses. Then, they launched a blooming and contending debate among the masses. More than 12,000 big-character posters were put up throughout the commune, coupled with various forms of publicity, to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work, strengthening everyone's confidence. Many technicians expressed their willingness to study technology diligently to ensure that all aspects of the country and commune members are satisfied. More than 10,000 catties of seed cotton sent to the processing plant by the commune a few days ago were sampled and tested, and the grade and fiber length were fully in line with standards.

### 公社化带来商业工作新变化  红旗社售棉自验自称自运

    公社化带来商业工作新变化
    红旗社售棉自验自称自运
    本报济南20日电　山东省临清县红旗人民公社统一安排劳力，采用自己验级、自己过磅、自己运交的先进售棉方法，作到了生产、售棉两不误。这一先进经验目前正在全省各地普遍推广。
    红旗人民公社今年粮棉都获得大丰收。棉花每亩可收籽棉二千斤，比去年提高五点六倍。为了保证及时完成棉花的采摘、交售任务，组织了二百四十个专职拾花组；抽出各种车辆二百辆、牲口四百头、社员四百名，专门负责棉花的运输交售。作到了随成熟、随拾摘、随出售、随运交。
    这个公社还首创了一套“三自”售棉花的先进经验。从棉花的验级、过磅、直到送入加工厂，全部由公社自己负责进行。这样不仅可以节省大批的人力物力，而且可以大大缩短周转往返的售棉时间，完全符合国家“快收、多收”的方针，同时对公社本身也很有利。据这个社预计，今年全社棉花总产量为籽棉一亿五千万斤，采用“三自”售棉法共可节省人畜劳动日各十五万个。
    红旗公社在实行“三自”售棉法之初，也曾遇到一些思想障碍，如干部顾虑没有技术员、仪器条件差，怕搞不好；顾虑群众政治思想水平不高，怕办不好对不起国家，影响公社信誉；嫌麻烦，怕出了问题要负责任等等。为了统一思想，首先在社党委的领导下，召开了干部、技术员、群众三种会议，然后在群众中鸣放辩论。全社共贴出大字报一万二千多张，配合各种宣传形式，展开广泛深入的宣传教育工作，坚定了大家的信心。许多技术员都表示要苦钻技术，保证作到国家、社员各方面满意。公社前些日子送加工厂的一万多斤籽棉，经抽验，品级、纤维长度都完全符合标准。（附图片）
