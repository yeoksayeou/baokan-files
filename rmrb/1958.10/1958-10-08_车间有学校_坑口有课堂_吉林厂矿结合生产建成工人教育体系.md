    Factories Have Schools, Mines Have Classrooms:
    Jilin Factories and Mines Combine Production to Build a Worker Education System

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Wang Wenlian reports: The widespread development of factory-run schools in Jilin Province, extending schools into workshops and mine entrances, has basically popularized workers' spare-time education.

    To date, over two thousand large and small factories and mines throughout the province have established more than 23,000 various spare-time schools and study groups. The number of employees participating in these studies accounts for over 80% of the province's total workforce of over 600,000 people. More than 700 schools are run by workshops and mine entrances in parts of Jilin, Liaoyuan, and Jiaohe cities and counties. More than sixty workshop schools, due to their teaching adapting to the characteristics of grassroots production and closely linking with reality, have not only significantly improved the cultural and technical levels of workers, but also produced a large number of inventions and technological innovations that have never existed before, greatly improving production efficiency and saving manpower and time. At the Jilin City Dye Factory's 2:3 Acid Workshop, 113 workers, after studying chemical machinery and chemical technology in the workshop school, workers in all types of work, such as autoclaves, 2:3 acid, raw material workers, cooking workers, and packaging workers, began to understand each other's operating procedures. Through collaboration, all types of workers in the entire workshop were transformed from single-skilled workers to multi-skilled workers, saving a total of twenty-two personnel. Recently, due to family members of employees finding employment, the three-shift system was changed to a four-shift system, allowing workers to study for two hours each day. Workers at the entire Jilin Railway Station, through spare-time study, understood many basic principles of railway work. They further discovered that the station's past division of labor was too detailed. After merging teams and adjusting job types, the three-shift system was changed to a four-shift system with basically no increase in manpower.

    Jilin Province's experience in running schools in workshops has developed on the basis of the universal establishment of schools by factories and mines. After the tasks of the technological revolution and cultural revolution were proposed, factories and mines throughout the province mobilized a large amount of manpower and resources to develop on the basis of the original spare-time schools. However, under the new situation where more than 600,000 employees throughout the province urgently demanded to learn culture and technology, the strength of factory-run schools appeared insufficient. Many large factories and mines, after spending a great deal of effort building dozens of classrooms and hiring dozens of teachers, could only accommodate a few hundred people, at most one or two thousand people. The remaining workers needed to wait for rounds of rotation, which could not meet the urgent needs of the current cultural revolution. Moreover, after factories and mines concentrated their efforts on running spare-time junior high schools and primary schools, they had no greater spare capacity to prepare for senior high schools and universities. Therefore, they could not meet the requirements of workers with higher cultural levels for further study. In addition, it was felt that all schools were completely factory (mine) scale, which was inconvenient for combining the production characteristics of each workshop and the workers' living patterns, making it impossible to fully guarantee study time, resulting in little effect and low interest from workers, affecting the development of teaching work. According to this method, a de-illiterate worker, after selectively studying a few major courses using the intensive training method with less practice, would be estimated to reach the level of university graduation after twelve years, which is too slow.

    In order to cultivate working-class intellectuals more, faster, better, and more economically, factories and mines used the methods of the rectification movement, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and conduct major debates, decentralizing the power of primary and junior high school education to workshops and mine entrances, and giving full play to the power of the masses to run them in a big way. After the decentralization of power, workers and workshop and mine entrance cadres were highly enthusiastic, making their own tables and chairs, using workshop rest rooms, conference rooms, dining rooms, and offices as classrooms, and laboratories as laboratories, making full use of existing equipment. In addition, because the number of people in the workshop was small, division into classes and subjects was easy, and classroom lectures could be combined with extracurricular tutoring, solving the phenomenon of uneven levels among students. They followed the principle of "the able are teachers," teaching and learning from each other. Cadres and university students assigned to the workshop served as teachers of cultural subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and language. Experienced veteran workers and engineering technicians explained technical courses, using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to learn production experience and technical theory. Workshop directors and party branch secretaries served as principals or political instructors, and trade union chairmen served as deans of academic affairs. The study time was roughly set at six to eight hours per week, with political courses accounting for 20%, and technical and cultural courses accounting for 40% each. Workers set school names and school rules for their own schools, the order was normal, and absenteeism has been eliminated. The technical textbooks for this new type of school are also very unique, mostly compiled based on current key production and major technical issues. The production experience of some veteran workers has been systematically summarized or written into lecture notes, directly guiding production and thereby improving labor productivity. According to the current teaching time, a worker who has become literate can reach the level of university associate degree graduation in nine years, which is three years shorter than running schools centrally by factories and mines. Because workshops and mine entrances run their own junior high schools and primary schools, factories and mines can free up their hands to run senior high schools and universities in a big way, so that workers' spare-time education can be both popularized and improved. Now, most factories and mines in Jilin Province have adopted this method of running schools together from top to bottom, closely integrating with production, and rapidly building a new type of worker education system.

### 车间有学校　坑口有课堂  吉林厂矿结合生产建成工人教育体系

    车间有学校　坑口有课堂
    吉林厂矿结合生产建成工人教育体系
    本报讯　记者王文琏报道：吉林省普遍发展的厂矿办学，把学校一直办到车间、坑口，基本普及了工人业余教育。
    到目前为止，全省二千多个大小厂矿已办起各种业余学校和学习小组二万三千多所（个），参加学习的职工占全省职工总数六十多万人的80％以上。吉林、辽源、蛟河三个市县的部分厂矿的车间、坑口所办的学校便有七百多个，有六十多个车间学校由于教学适应了基层生产的特点，密切联系实际，不仅显著地提高了工人的文化技术水平，而且出现了过去从来没有过的大量创造发明和技术革新，大大提高了生产效率，节省了人力和时间。吉林市染料厂2∶3酸车间的一百一十三名工人，由于在车间学校里学习了化工机械学和化工工艺，高压釜、2∶3酸、原料工、蒸煮工、包装工等工段和工序各工种工人，开始理解了彼此的操作过程，经过协作，全车间各工种的工人都由单面手培养成为多面手，共节省了二十二个人力。最近由于职工家属就业，改三班制为四班制，使工人每天可以学习二小时。吉林市铁路车站全站工人在业余学习中，懂得了铁路工作的许多基本原理，进而发现该站过去有些工作分工过细，经过合并班组、调整工种以后，在基本不增加人力的基础上，改三班制为四班制。
    吉林省车间办学的经验是在厂矿普遍办学的基础上发展起来的。当技术革命和文化革命的任务提出以后，全省各地厂矿在原有业余学校的基础上，调动了大批人力、物力加以发展。但是在全省六十多万名职工迫切要求学习文化技术的新形势下，厂矿办学的力量就显得不够。许多大的厂矿，费了九牛二虎之力，盖了几十个教室，聘请了几十名教员，也不过容纳几百人，最多不过一、二千人，其余的工人，需要等待一期一期的轮换，不能适应当前文化革命的紧急需要，而且厂矿集中力量办了业余初中和小学以后，也就没有更大的余力筹办高中和大学，因此不能满足文化较高的工人继续深造的要求。另外，还感到所有学校完全是全厂（矿）规模，就不便结合各车间的生产特点和工人生活规律，使学习时间不能得到充分保证，因而效果不大，工人的兴趣不高，影响教学工作的开展。按照这样的方式，一个脱盲工人，用精讲少练的速成法选修几门主要课程，估计要在十二年以后才能达到大学毕业程度，速度太慢。
    为了多快好省地培养工人阶级知识分子，各厂矿运用整风运动的方法，发动群众大鸣大放，大辩论，将小学和初中教育的权力下放到车间、坑口，发挥群众力量大办特办。权力下放以后，工人和车间、坑口干部情绪高涨，自制桌椅板凳，以车间休息室、会议室、食堂、办公室当教室，化验室当实验室，充分利用现有设备。另外，由于车间人数较少，分班分科容易，课堂讲课与课外辅导也能结合，解决了学员中程度参差不齐的现象。他们以“能者为师”的原则，互教互学。由车间的下放干部和大学生担任数、理、化、语文等文化课教员。具有生产经验的老工人和工程技术人员讲解技术课，采用土洋结合的办法，学习生产经验和技术理论。车间主任、党支部书记担任校长或政治教员，工会主席担任教务长。学习时间大致规定为每周六小时至八小时，其中政治课占20％，技术课和文化课各占40％。工人给自己的学校定校名、立校规，秩序正常，已消灭无故缺席。这种新型学校的技术课本也很别致，大都根据当前的生产关键和重大技术问题编写。有些老工人的生产经验已被系统地总结出来或写成讲稿，直接指导生产，并由此提高劳动生产效率。按目前教学时间计，一个脱盲后的工人，可以在九年内达到大学专科毕业水平，比厂矿集中办学缩短三年。由于车间、坑口自办初中、小学，厂矿便能抽出手来大办高中和大学，使得工人业余教育既能普及，又有提高。现在吉林省多数厂矿都采取了这种上下一齐办学的方法，紧密结合生产，迅速建成新型的工人教育体系。
