Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th – From September 20th to October 19th, the First Ministry of Machine Building convened three national on-site conferences in Shanghai, centered on steam turbines, turbine generators, and boilers respectively, focusing on how to make the thermal power equipment manufacturing industry bloom everywhere.

Since the beginning of this year, the great leap forward in the steel and machinery industries has greatly increased the nation's electricity consumption. According to general proportions, every additional ton of steel produced requires an additional kilowatt of power generation equipment. This year, the nation's steel production doubled, but power generation equipment could only increase by about 50%, creating an imbalance. Some regions are already experiencing insufficient power supply. Next year, with further leaps forward in the national steel and machinery industries, electricity supply will become an even more critical key issue. In the past few years, the production of power generation equipment in our country has been concentrated in a few regions such as Shanghai and Harbin. This situation can no longer adapt to the new situation. All regions must be able to manufacture complete sets of power generation equipment themselves. Not only machinery factories, but also power plants with better conditions should manufacture power generation equipment in order to quickly catch up with the needs of production development.

The three on-site conferences believed that in order to achieve this, it is first necessary to break down all superstitions. As long as people dare to think and dare to act, and give full play to collective wisdom in the technological revolution, various steam turbines, generators, and boilers can be made using indigenous equipment, indigenous methods, and small machines. The Harbin Ji Lian Machine Factory is a small factory that has never produced steam turbines before, and its equipment conditions are also very poor. However, they were ambitious and overcame many difficulties in technology and materials. They improved three ordinary milling machines and milled the most precise blades on the steam turbine, and for the first time manufactured two small steam turbines. When Shanghai Sifang Boiler Factory recently manufactured boilers for 750-kilowatt turbine generators, they did not have large horizontal boring machines. The workers installed some attachments on a small drilling machine and solved the problem of drilling holes in the steam drum. This factory has made dozens of indigenous equipment this year in order to manufacture boilers for power stations. In the process of trial-manufacturing a complete set of 2,000-kilowatt turbine generator equipment, the Beijing Repair and Manufacturing Factory of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power did not have many important equipment. The employees used small machines to do big jobs and improved processing techniques and other methods, and finally successfully trial-manufactured it in seventy days. Now they are preparing to trial-manufacture a 6,000-kilowatt turbine generator. The introduction of these experiences greatly broadened the horizons of representatives from various regions and was greatly encouraged.

Because the manufacturing technology of power generation equipment is relatively complex and involves a wide range of aspects, the conference emphasized that close cooperation and strengthened collaboration are needed between regions and between relevant industrial departments. Old factories with more production experience should help newly built factories solve the technical difficulties in the initial stage of production. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen contact with relevant departments and prepare various steel, copper wire, insulation materials and other materials needed for expanding production in a timely manner.

More than 600 representatives from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country participated in these three on-site conferences. Most of them had no experience in producing power generation equipment in the past, but after exchanging technical experience, their thinking was greatly liberated, and they were all prepared to go back to various regions and make a big effort. Representatives from Sichuan, Jiangsu and other places originally planned to ask the state for a batch of equipment, but now they are preparing to go back and solve it themselves using indigenous methods, and try their best to achieve self-reliance.

    大造发电设备　保证电力先行
    一机部推广用土办法小机器干大活
    新华社上海24日电　从9月20日到10月19日，第一机械工业部在上海分别以汽轮机、汽轮发电机、锅炉为中心，召开了三个全国性的现场会议，集中研究了火力发电设备制造工业如何遍地开花的问题。
    今年以来，钢铁和机械工业的大跃进，使全国用电量大大增加。按一般比例，每增产一吨钢就需要增加一瓩的发电设备。今年全国钢产量增长一倍，但发电设备只能增加50％左右，两者之间出现了不平衡的现象。目前有些地区已经发生电力供应不足的情况。明年全国钢铁、机械工业进一步跃进，电力供应就将成为更重要的关键问题。过去几年，我国发电设备的生产集中在上海、哈尔滨等少数几个地区，这种情况现在已经不能适应新的形势。各地必须都做到能自己制造成套发电设备，不仅机械工厂，就是条件较好的发电厂也应该制造发电设备，才能迅速赶上生产发展的需要。
    三个现场会议认为，为了做到这点，首先必须破除各种迷信。只要人们敢想敢做，在技术革命中发挥集体智慧，用土设备、土办法、小机器同样能够做出各种汽轮机、发电机和锅炉。哈尔滨机联机器厂是一个从未生产过汽轮机的小厂，设备条件也很差，但他们雄心勃勃，在技术上、材料上克服了许多困难，把三台普通铣床加以改进，铣出了汽轮机上最精密的叶片，第一次制成了两台小型的汽轮机。上海四方锅炉厂最近在制造七百五十瓩汽轮发电机用的锅炉时，没有大型的横臂钻床，工人们把一台小钻床装上一些附件，解决了汽包钻孔的问题。这个厂为了制造发电站用的锅炉，今年已做成了几十种土设备。水利电力部北京修造厂在试制二千瓩整套汽轮发电设备的过程中，很多重要设备都没有，职工们就采用小机器干大活，改进加工工艺等办法，终于在七十天内试制成功，现在又在准备试制六千瓩的汽轮发电机。这些经验的介绍，使各地代表大开眼界，受到了很大的鼓舞。
    由于发电设备制造技术比较复杂，牵涉面很广，会议强调各地区之间，各有关工业部门之间需要密切配合，加强协作。生产经验比较丰富的老厂，要帮助新建工厂解决生产初期的技术困难。其次，必须与有关部门加强联系，及时准备好扩大生产所需的各种钢材、铜线、绝缘材料等器材。
    参加这三个现场会议的，有全国二十七个省、市、自治区的代表共六百多人。他们过去绝大部分都没有生产发电设备的经验，但在交流了技术经验以后，思想大为解放，都准备回到各地大干一场。四川、江苏等地的代表，原来打算向国家要一批设备，现在都准备回去用土办法自己解决，尽量做到自力更生。（附图片）
