Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 20th: Liaoning Province is comprehensively implementing the agricultural production increase policy centered on water and fertilizer as prerequisites, deep plowing as the foundation, and good seeds and close planting as the core, launching a vigorous agricultural turnaround movement, striving to achieve a grain "thousand-jin province" and a cotton "hundred-jin province" next year.

This year, Liaoning Province's agricultural production has achieved a bumper harvest. Despite suffering severe drought, the total grain output can still increase by 30% compared to last year; both grain and cotton output have exceeded the bumper year of 1956. However, the plan for "self-sufficiency" in grain, pork, and vegetables has not been completed. In particular, compared with the speed of the national agricultural Great Leap Forward, Liaoning's agricultural production has not yet turned around. The main reason for this situation is that the mind has not been completely liberated. The agricultural production increase policy of "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density plus field management" formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has not been conscientiously implemented. Some leading cadres and many regions continue to implement the old practice of wide ridges and shallow cultivation, extensive planting and low yield. They are not leading agricultural production with revolutionary leap forward methods, but with reformist gradual methods. As a result, the degree of water conservancy in the province this year is still less than 30%, the cultivated land has not been deeply plowed, the amount of manure accumulated is small and of poor quality, and good seeds have not been vigorously promoted.

In order to change this backward state of agricultural production, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, decided to resolutely launch an agricultural revolution movement, vigorously increase the yield per unit area, and require that next year the province's grain, cotton, and some agricultural and sideline products should be at least doubled compared to this year, becoming a grain "thousand-jin province" and a cotton "hundred-jin province." In order to ensure the completion of this combat task, the Provincial Party Committee has made a comprehensive deployment of rural work this winter and next spring, and decided that Huang Oudong, the Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, will lead agriculture. It stipulates that local Party committees and county Party committees must focus on leading agriculture if agriculture has not yet turned around, and at the same time implement the policy of promoting both industry and agriculture. The first secretaries of local and county Party committees must focus on leading agriculture. In order to enable the agricultural revolution movement to be victoriously carried out on the basis of ideological revolution, the Provincial Party Committee, at a recent rectification expansion meeting attended by secretaries of local, municipal, and county Party committees and principal responsible cadres of various departments, conducted a serious review and criticism of the right-leaning thinking and lack of revolutionary spirit in past agricultural leadership, and improved the ideological level of leading cadres at all levels. The Provincial Party Committee determined that this winter and next spring, in the rural party organizations at all levels and among the broad masses, in conjunction with production, we should earnestly strengthen political and ideological work, launch a great blooming, great contending, and great debate, resolutely pull out the white flags and plant the red flags on the agricultural front from top to bottom, and lay an ideological foundation for the great agricultural turnaround next year.

In terms of increasing production measures to strive for a great agricultural turnaround next year, the Provincial Party Committee requires: First, vigorously engage in deep plowing. Before the ground freezes this autumn, ensure that at least 45 million mu are deeply plowed, of which 30 million mu should be plowed to a depth of one to one and a half feet, and 15 million mu should be plowed to a depth of more than two feet. The "satellite" fields should all be deeply plowed to a depth of more than three feet. In conjunction with deep plowing, all existing manure should be applied to the soil in layers; if the soil layer is too thin to be deeply plowed, "foreign soil" should be borrowed to pad it to a thickness of more than one foot in order to improve the soil. Second, work hard for one winter and one spring, and basically achieve water conservancy in the province before the "May 1st" Labor Day next year, with an irrigation area of ​​52.5 million mu, accounting for 80% of the province's total cultivated land area, so as to ensure a bumper harvest throughout the year without rain. Third, increase the amount of fertilizer applied and improve the quality of manure. Fourth, next year, all crops will be densely planted, and the density will be increased by one, two or three times compared to this year. Some major crops must basically achieve good seed coverage.

Further improving the people's communes is the organizational guarantee for striving for a great agricultural turnaround next year. The Provincial Party Committee requires party committees at all levels to take the socialist and communist education movement as the center this winter and next spring, and further consolidate and improve the people's communes politically, economically, ideologically, and organizationally. Develop the production of the communes at high speed, increase income and accumulation; improve the organizational structure of the communes, and adjust the production organization of the communes; expand the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, and the collectivization of life, universally establish militia divisions, do a good job in collective life centered on public canteens, and continuously improve the degree of collectivization; in terms of operation and management, vigorously promote production planning, specialized labor organization, democratic management, and economic accounting; do a good job in the distribution of the people's communes; gradually eliminate the remnants of private ownership of the means of production, earnestly implement the class line, continue to consolidate the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants, and ensure the continuous strengthening and expansion of communist ideological and economic factors in the people's communes; thereby enabling the people's communes to play a greater superiority in the great leap forward in production.

Since entering October, the people of the province have responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, and a production upsurge has taken shape in the vast rural areas. People's communes in various places have universally implemented large-scale group operations, forming various field armies and shock brigades, dividing them into four fronts: steel, autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and water conservancy, with the four armies advancing side by side. After the provincial radio mobilization meeting for vigorously engaging in deep plowing was held on the 8th, more than 8.77 million mu had been plowed by the 15th, a sharp increase of five times compared to the plowing area in the 20 days before the 8th. On the water conservancy front, more than 1,500 large and small projects have started construction one after another. The manure accumulation movement has also achieved great results. In various cities, a movement to support the great agricultural turnaround by going to the countryside is also underway. (Attached picture)

    开展农业革命运动
    辽宁决心赶上先进
    新华社沈阳20日电　辽宁省正在全面贯彻以水肥为前提、以深翻为基础、以良种密植为中心的农业增产方针，掀起轰轰烈烈的农业大翻身运动，力争明年实现粮食千斤省和百斤皮棉省。
    今年辽宁省的农业生产获得了丰收，在遭受严重旱灾的情况下，粮食总产量仍然可以比去年增产30％；粮食和棉花的产量都超过大丰收的1956年。但是粮食、猪肉、蔬菜“三自给”的计划没有完成，特别是和全国农业大跃进的速度比较，辽宁的农业生产还没有翻身。造成这种情况的主要原因，是思想还没有彻底解放，没有认真贯彻执行党中央和毛主席制订的“水、肥、土、种、密加田间管理”的农业增产方针，某些领导干部和很多地区仍然继续执行着宽垅浅耕、广种薄收的老一套作法，不是用革命的跃进的办法而是用改良的渐进的办法领导农业生产，以致今年全省水利化的程度还不到30％，耕地没有深翻，积的粪肥数量少质量差，优良种子也推广得不力。
    为了改变这种农业生产的落后状况，中共辽宁省委根据中央的指示，决定坚决开展一个农业革命运动，大力提高单位面积产量，要求明年全省粮食、棉花和某些农副业产品的产量比今年最少要翻一番，成为粮食千斤省和百斤皮棉省。为了保证完成这一战斗任务，省委已对今冬明春的农村工作作了全面部署，确定由省委第二书记黄欧东领导农业；规定各地委和县委在农业还没有翻身的情况下，必须以领导农业为主，同时贯彻执行工农业并举的方针，地委、县委的第一书记必须以领导农业为重点。为了使农业革命运动能够在思想革命的基础上胜利地开展起来，省委在最近举行的有地、市、县委书记和各部门主要负责干部参加的整风扩大会议上，对过去农业领导中的右倾思想和缺乏革命精神的错误作法，进行了严肃的检查和批判，提高了各级领导干部的思想水平。省委确定今冬明春在农村各级党的组织和广大群众中，结合生产，认真加强政治思想工作，展开大鸣大放大辩论，在农业战线上从上到下坚决拔掉白旗，插上红旗，为明年农业大翻身打下思想基础。
    在争取明年农业大翻身的增产措施方面，省委要求：一、大搞深翻地。今秋结冻前保证至少要深翻四千五百万亩，其中深翻一尺到一尺半的要达到三千万亩，深翻二尺以上的要达到一千五百万亩，“卫星”田都要深翻三尺以上。结合深翻，把现有粪肥全部分层施到地里；土层太薄不能深翻的，要借“客土”垫厚一尺以上，以达到改良土壤的目的。二、大干一冬一春，在明年“五一”节以前全省基本实现水利化，灌溉面积达到五千二百五十万亩，占全省总耕地面积80％，作到全年无雨保丰收。三、增加施肥量，提高粪肥质量。四、明年各种作物都实行密植，密度要比今年增加一两倍或三倍以上。一些主要作物要基本达到良种化。
    进一步办好人民公社，是争取明年农业大翻身的组织保证。省委要求各级党委在今冬明春以开展社会主义和共产主义教育运动为中心，进一步从政治上、经济上、思想上、组织上巩固和提高人民公社。高速度发展公社的生产、增加收入和积累；健全公社的组织机构，调整公社的生产组织；扩大组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，普遍建立民兵师，搞好以公共食堂为中心的集体生活，不断提高集体化程度；经营管理要大力推行生产计划化、劳动组织专业化、管理民主化、经济核算化；做好人民公社的分配工作；逐步消灭生产资料私有制的残余，认真贯彻阶级路线，继续巩固贫农和下中农的领导优势，保证人民公社共产主义思想因素和经济因素的不断增强和扩大；从而使人民公社在生产大跃进中发挥更大的优越性。
    进入10月份以来，全省人民响应省委的号召，广大农村中的生产高潮已经形成。各地人民公社普遍实行了大兵团作战，组成各种野战军和突击队，划分钢铁、秋收、秋耕、水利四条战线，四路大军齐头并进。8日举行全省大搞深翻地誓师广播大会后，到15日已翻地八百七十七万多亩，比8日前二十天的翻地面积骤增五倍。水利战线上，已有一千五百多处大小工程先后开工。积肥运动也已取得巨大成绩。在各个城市里，一个支援农业大翻身的下乡运动也正在展开。（附图片）
