    Various Countries' Public Opinion Welcomes Minister Peng Dehuai's Letter to Taiwan Compatriots
    Vietnam "People's Daily" Says
    China is Determined to Recover its Territory
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th. The "People's Daily" published a commentary today stating that Minister of National Defense of China, Marshal Peng Dehuai’s order to temporarily cease shelling Jinmen and his letter to Taiwan compatriots, reflects the concern of the Chinese people for the people of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and at the same time demonstrates the Chinese people’s strong will to recover their territory. The letter to Taiwan compatriots also illustrates that the Chinese government is constantly striving for the peaceful liberation of its territory.
    The commentary said that the People's Republic of China's order to temporarily cease shelling Jinmen is entirely out of noble humanitarian considerations, and is by no means based on the so-called "ceasefire" proposed by the American authorities. As Marshal Peng Dehuai's statement said, "There is no war between the People's Republic of China and the United States, so there is no such thing as a ceasefire." It is clear to people that the American conspiracy to demand a Chinese "ceasefire" is an attempt to force China to recognize American interference in China's internal affairs, so that the United States has the opportunity to further condone Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the Chinese mainland. The United States deliberately confuses the issue of China's recovery of Jinmen and Mazu and the liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands with the dispute between China and the United States in order to cover up their aggressive conspiracy.
    The commentary pointed out that Marshal Peng Dehuai's statement opened a way out for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. If American imperialism does not stop their provocative behavior, and does not withdraw its troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, if they are still not honest in conducting negotiations on the basis of respecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, then they must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences. If the Chiang Kai-shek clique remains unrepentant, they will also be severely punished by the Chinese people.

### 越南“人民报”说  中国决心要收复自己领土

    各国舆论欢迎彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书
    越南“人民报”说
    中国决心要收复自己领土
    新华社河内7日电　“人民报”今天发表评论说，中国国防部长彭德怀元帅关于暂时停止炮击金门的命令和告台湾同胞书，反映了中国人民对自己的领土台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖人民的关心，同时说明了中国人民决心恢复自己的领土的坚强意志。告台湾同胞书也说明了中国政府时刻努力争取和平解放自己的领土。
    评论说中华人民共和国的暂时停止炮击金门的命令完全是从高尚的人道主义出发的，而决不是根据美国当局提出的所谓“停火”而发出的。正如彭德怀元帅的文告中所说的，“中华人民共和国与美国之间并无战争，无所谓停火”，人们看得很清楚，美国要求中国“停火”的阴谋是企图迫使中国承认美国对中国内政的干涉，以便让美国有机会更多地纵容蒋介石进攻中国大陆。美国故意把中国收复金门、马祖和解放台湾和澎湖列岛的问题和中国同美国之间的争端混为一谈，以掩饰他们的侵略阴谋。
    评论指出，彭德怀元帅的文告给美帝国主义和蒋介石集团打开了出路。如果美帝国主义不停止他们的挑衅行为，不从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤军，如果他们还不老老实实地在尊重中国的主权和领土完整的基础上进行谈判，那么他们要对严重的后果负全部责任。如果蒋介石集团仍然执迷不悟，他们也一定会受到中国人民的严厉惩罚。
