    Orientated Towards Production, Orientated Towards the Province, Orientated Towards the Countryside:
    Henan Thoroughly Reforms Agricultural School Textbooks
    (Our Dispatch) To innovate the teaching content of agricultural schools and thoroughly correct the phenomenon of education being divorced from practical production, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry organized 126 agricultural school teachers to completely rewrite the textbooks for agricultural colleges, secondary and primary agricultural schools, from the beginning of March to the end of August. The newly compiled textbooks include sixteen majors such as crop cultivation, plant protection, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural machinery, with 150 textbooks, approximately 3.7 million words. In addition, teaching plans and syllabuses for the above-mentioned schools were also compiled.
    The method of compiling the textbooks this time was to break with convention and jump out of the old circle. The first step in compiling was to first "empty the mind", go to the countryside and mountains, and conduct investigations and research in agricultural cooperatives and production units to summarize advanced production experiences. The comrades participating in the compilation of textbooks formed fourteen professional groups, and from mid-March to June 7th, for more than two months, they traveled to seventy-one counties in seven special districts of Henan Province, visited a total of 178 agricultural cooperatives, and 1,307 production units, directly collecting 3,193 kinds of reference materials from the masses. In addition, a large amount of data was collected from agricultural departments and scientific research institutions, laying a good foundation for the compilation work.
    The content of the new textbooks prominently embodies the policy of education serving proletarian politics and serving production, clearly demonstrates the characteristics of the Henan region, and is closely integrated with local production practices. For example, the introduction to past textbooks on crop cultivation generally discussed the use, role, cultivation history, and distribution of the national economy. The introduction to the new textbooks discusses how China's wheat output surpassed the United States this year. The content of each chapter of the textbook is closely integrated with Henan's production practices. For example, past textbooks only generally discussed the morphology of crops, while the current textbook focuses on discussing the characteristics of the Henan region. For example, during the wheat sowing period, Henan is in a dry season, but wheat needs water. Therefore, the textbook focuses on taking measures such as deep plowing, fine harrowing, and drought resistance to change this situation. Also, when wheat is jointing in the spring, wheat requires high temperatures, but Henan's climate is hot and cold, and it suffers from frost damage every year. The new textbook focuses on measures to prevent frost damage. Textbooks on crops such as rice, corn, cotton, and tobacco also have these characteristics. In the crop cultivation textbooks, advanced production experiences directly taken from the masses account for about one-third to one-half. The combination of other subject textbooks and production has also been significantly strengthened. Most of the primary and secondary mathematics textbooks are taken from actual problems in production, and mathematics practice classes have also been added, that is, going to the field and into fields for practical operation. The chemistry class greatly increased the production principles and processes of steel, cement, chemical fertilizers, and biogas. Many of the new textbooks have disrupted the old textbook arrangement system and reorganized a new system. Therefore, the newly compiled textbooks are closely linked to theory and practice, and can cultivate students to become socialist all-rounders who have both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, and who can master agricultural professional production knowledge and be familiar with industrial production.
    In the process of compilation, the proletarian educational ideology and the bourgeois educational ideology, the struggle between the method of compiling quickly, well and economically and the method of compiling slowly, poorly and expensively was consistently implemented, and the bourgeois compilation viewpoints were continuously cleared. Liu Zuotang, the former director of the teaching affairs section of Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School, vilified the leap forward plan for compiling textbooks proposed by the leadership and the masses as the spirit of Ah Q. Some also refused to include the advanced production experience of the masses into the textbooks. For example, Mu Chenghui, the subject director of the Agricultural and Forestry Cadre School, was responsible for compiling the task of sweet potatoes. The output of sweet potatoes produced by the masses has reached hundreds of thousands or even millions of catties, but he did not cite these materials in compiling textbooks, but cited materials from the United Kingdom and Japan. Some say that it is not good to compile quickly. For these problems, the Party branch has always implemented the mass line, and repeatedly carried out the struggle between the two roads and two methods through the methods of great contending, great blooming, and big-character posters. For those who still adhered to their original positions and viewpoints through debate, some were stopped from their work, and some had their compiled textbooks handed over to others to compile. For example, Mu Chenghui's sweet potato textbook, the comrades of the crop cultivation group held several meetings with him to debate, but he still insisted on his original position and viewpoint and refused to modify it. Finally, the comrades of the crop cultivation group completely rewrote the textbooks he compiled.
    The vast majority of teachers participating in the compilation of textbooks demonstrated a high degree of socialist revolutionary drive, traversing mountains and rivers, and conducting investigations and visits regardless of wind or rain. For example, in the Shangqiu Special District, teachers braved strong winds and rain of about level 8 and went to agricultural cooperatives dozens of miles away to conduct investigations, sometimes carrying luggage over several mountains a day, running dozens or even hundreds of miles. Every time they went to an agricultural cooperative, they mostly worked while conducting investigations and visits, or participated in labor during the day and convened forums with advanced producers at night to summarize advanced experience. In the compilation, teachers have successively made leap forward plans. The mathematics group put forward the slogan of "hanging their heads from the beams and pricking their thighs with awls, one book in three days and three nights." For nearly two months, most teachers wrote until two or three o'clock in the night almost every day. Through more than five months of textbook compilation work, the teachers' awareness has been greatly improved. They deeply realized the importance of putting politics in command. They said that this compilation work is a triple harvest of ideology, business, and physical health.

    面向生产　面向本省　面向农村
    河南彻底改革农业学校教材
    本报讯　为了革新农业学校的教学内容，彻底纠正教育脱离生产实际的现象，河南省农林厅组织一百二十六名农业学校的教师，从3月初开始到8月下旬止，全部重新编写了农业专科学校、中等和初级农业学校的教材。新编教材计有作物栽培、植物保护、畜牧兽医、农业机械等十六个专业，教科书一百五十本，约三千七百万字，另外，还编写上述学校的教学计划和教学大纲。
    这次编写教材的方法是打破常规，跳出旧的圈子，编写的第一步是先务虚，下乡、上山，到农业社和生产单位去进行调查研究，总结先进生产经验。参加编写教材的同志组成十四个专业小组，从3月中旬到6月7日两个多月内，他们分别跑遍了河南省七个专区七十一个县，共访问一百七十八个农业合作社，一千三百零七个生产单位，直接从群众中收集了三千一百九十三种参考资料。此外，还从农业部门和科学研究机关搜集了大量资料，为编写工作奠定了良好的基础。
    这次新编教材内容突出地体现了教育为无产阶级政治服务、为生产服务的方针，鲜明地表现了河南地区的特点，和当地生产实际结合很密切。例如，作物栽培学过去教材的绪论是一般的讲国民经济的用途、作用、栽培历史和它的分布情况，新编教材的绪论是讲我国今年小麦产量压倒美国。教材各章的内容密切结合河南生产实际，如作物形态，过去的教材只一般的讲作物的形态，此次教材则密切结合河南地区特点去讲，如小麦播种期间河南正是干旱季节，但小麦正需要水，因而教材着重讲采取深耕、细耙、抗旱等措施，来改变这种情况，又如春天小麦拔节时，小麦要求温度高，但河南的气候却忽冷忽热，年年遭冻害，新编教材着重讲防止冻害的措施。水稻、玉米、棉花、烟等作物教材也都具有这些特点。在作物栽培的教材中，直接取自群众的先进生产经验约占三分之一到二分之一。其他各科教材和生产的结合也显著加强了，数学初级和中级教材绝大部分取自于生产中的实际问题，并且还增加了数学实习课，即到野外、到田间去进行实际操作。化学课大大增加了钢铁、水泥、化肥、沼气的生产原理和生产过程。这次新的教材不少已打乱旧教材的编排系统，另行组织了新的系统。因此，这次新编的教材理论和实际联系很密切，能够培养学生成为既有理论知识又有实际技能，既能掌握农业专业生产知识，又能熟悉工业生产的社会主义多面手。
    在编写过程中，始终贯串了无产阶级的教育思想和资产阶级的教育思想，多快好省的编写方法和少慢差费的编写方法的斗争，不断清算了资产阶级的编写观点。原参加教材编写工作的郑州农业机械化学校教务科长刘祚堂，对于领导和群众提出的编写教材的跃进规划，诬蔑为阿Q精神。也有拒绝把群众的先进生产经验编入教材，例如农林干校的学科主任慕承辉担任编写红薯的任务，群众生产红薯的产量已达到几十万斤以至百万斤，他编写教材不引用这些材料，而引用英国、日本的材料。有的说编得快就编不好。对于这些问题，党支部始终贯彻放手发动群众，通过大鸣大放大字报的方式，反复开展了两条道路，两种方法的斗争。对于通过辩论仍然坚持原来立场观点的，有的则停止他的工作，有的把他编写的教材交给别人编写，例如慕承辉编写的红薯教材，作物栽培组的同志同他开会辩论多次，他仍然坚持原来的立场、观点，拒不修改，最后由作物栽培组的同志将他编的教材全部作了改写。
    参加编写教材的绝大多数教师，发挥了高度的社会主义革命干劲，跋山涉水，风雨无阻地进行调查访问。例如在商丘专区，教师们冒着八级左右的大风雨，分赴几十里外的农业社进行调查，有时背着行李一天越几个山头跑几十里以至百余里路。每到一个农业社，他们大都是一边劳动，一边调查访问，或是白天参加劳动，夜间召集先进生产者座谈，总结先进经验。在编写中，教师们纷纷订出跃进规划，数学组提出了“头悬梁，锥刺股，三天三夜一本书。”的口号。将近两个月的时间里，大多数教师几乎每天都写到深夜两、三点钟。通过了五个多月的教材编写工作，教师们的觉悟大大提高了，他们深深体会到政治挂帅的重要性，他们说这次编写工作是思想、业务、身体三丰收。
