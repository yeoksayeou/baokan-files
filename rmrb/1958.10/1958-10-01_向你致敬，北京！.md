    Hail to You, Beijing!
    Soviet Union, Jihongnuofu

    Since childhood, I've dreamed of meeting you, like a beautiful dream held in my heart. But you were so far away from us, like a legend, on the other side of the magical Great Wall. Today, we hurry on our way in the hazy dawn, crossing valleys under the starlit sky, crossing the forests of Siberia, to wholeheartedly say in the name of our Soviet country: "Hail to you, Beijing!" Snowflakes flutter over the city dressed in autumn, covering the branches, covering the red walls. This white snow is like apple blossoms, and I smell the flowers, like smelling the fragrance of spring. Snow covers palaces, temples, and shaded paths, countless years in this world of silver, but taking a breath of the cold morning air, I appreciate your full youth. When Beijingers come out to do morning exercises, driving the last nightmare out of their sleepy village, the city's neat alleys and streets suddenly become sports fields. I see your small and comfortable bungalows, the flowers and plants on the ground so peaceful, so leisurely, but right next to them, you have erected towering palaces of labor. I am amazed at how boldly your new strides are taken on the straight streets, but I am even more amazed at this world of high-rise buildings, your vigorous construction workers. I know you were the capital of emperors, wielding spears and swords for thousands of years... What power do they have, what defenses, in the face of your people's great strength? When the vast ocean of the people surges and rolls in front of Tiananmen Square, let any enemy come and see what lesson China will give them. It is the worker, it is the clear blue sky, its sound is the future of the world calling out. If anyone wants to be a few years younger, I hope he hurries to see China. There, all kinds of miracles are being created, but it is as simple as my life. My childhood dream of the magical Beijing has now become life, become real friendship. We have a common path, may the friendship of our two great nations last forever. Hail to you, great capital, hail to you, Communist Beijing!

### 向你致敬，北京！

    向你致敬，北京！
    苏联　吉洪诺夫童年时候我就幻想和你相见，好像一个美梦怀在我的心间，但是你离开我们那么遥远，像传说一样，在神奇的万里长城那边。今天，我们在蒙胧的晨光中赶路，越过星空下的山谷，越过西伯利亚的森林，为了以我们苏维埃国家的名义衷心地说一声：“向你致敬，北京！”雪花飘在穿着秋装的城上，复盖着树枝，复盖着红墙，这白雪好似朵朵苹果花儿，我闻着花儿，像闻着春天的芳香。白雪笼罩着宫殿、庙宇、林荫小径，数不清这白银世界里有多少年辰，但是吸过一口清晨的寒冷空气，我领略到了你饱满的青春。当北京人出来作广播体操，把最后一个梦魔赶出睡乡，城里整齐的小巷大街，一下子都变成了运动场。我看见你小巧舒适的平房，地上的花草那样宁静，那样悠闲，可是就在这旁边，你又竖立起一座座高耸的劳动的宫殿。我惊奇你那新的步伐在笔直的大街上迈得多么果敢，但是我更惊奇这高楼大厦的世界，你那朝气蓬勃的建设人员。我知道你是帝王们的都城，长矛和刀剑摆弄了几千年……他们有什么力量，有什么防卫，在你全民的伟大力量面前？当人民的汪洋大海在天安门前澎湃、翻滚，让任何的敌人来看看吧，中国会给他们什么教训。它是劳动者，它是晴朗的蓝天，它的声响是世界的未来在叫喊，如果有谁想年轻几岁，希望他赶快去中国看看。那里正创造着种种奇迹，可是这也像我的生活那样单纯，我童年时代对神奇的北京的美梦，如今在那儿成了生活，成了真实的友情。我们有一条共同的道路，愿我们两大民族的情谊万古长青，向你致敬，伟大的首都，向你致敬，共产主义的北京！
