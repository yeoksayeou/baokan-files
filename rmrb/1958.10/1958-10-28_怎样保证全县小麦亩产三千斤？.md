How to Guarantee a County-Wide Wheat Yield of 3,000 Jin Per Mu?
Shen Hanmin, First Secretary of the Gucheng County Party Committee

The intense winter sowing battle has already begun. In order to maintain its red banner and achieve the plan of 360,000 mu of wheat with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu next year, Gucheng County is seizing the optimal sowing period around the Frost's Descent solar term in mountainous, plain, and hilly areas to concentrate all efforts on planting wheat. Our slogan is: "Exert full effort to create miracles, strive for the upper reaches to maintain the red banner, work hard and cleverly, difficulties cannot overwhelm heroes, be a hero or a good fellow, and must break through the 3,000 jin wheat barrier."

Can this plan be realized? We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and the correct guidance of the provincial and prefectural Party committees, as long as we can fully utilize the great superiority of the people's communes and apply the increased production experience of the past few years, we are fully confident in achieving it. What measures can guarantee a yield of 3,000 jin? Specifically, based on summarizing the increased production experience of 1958, we must firmly grasp the following five major yield-increasing links:

(1) Deep plowing to one chi, breaking clods to preserve moisture. Doing a good job of preparing the land and preserving moisture in a timely manner is one of the important preparatory tasks for growing wheat well. Many model farmers say it well: "Autumn crops depend on the hoe, spring crops depend on the plow." However, in the past, because we did not grasp this point, we often encountered dry soil that was difficult to plow, or the plowing was not deep enough and the harrowing was not thorough enough, resulting in uneven emergence and affecting yield. Last year, we learned this lesson and adopted the method of plowing and harrowing one piece after another as the yellow crops were harvested, while promoting the experience of the Leming Cooperative in Shenwan Township in performing vertical and horizontal deep plowing, cross-harrowing, and breaking clods to preserve moisture. After the autumn crops were harvested, the soil was immediately shallow-plowed to expose the soil slab for three to five cun, then harrowed once to retain moisture, and after six or seven days of sun-drying, it was plowed horizontally a second time, deepening the cultivated layer by five or six cun, followed by a straight harrowing, and the third and fourth passes were gradually shallow-plowed to loosen the soil, thereby ensuring the robust growth of wheat seedlings. This is because deep plowing not only generally eliminated underground ridges, increased the soil utilization layer, and allowed the underground soil layer to be weathered by the sun, promoting fertilizer decomposition and increasing soil fertility, but also because the cultivated layer was deep, the wheat's root system had a wide range of growth and was deeply rooted. The result of the vigorous development of the root system was a corresponding increase in the tillering rate. As a result, the wheat grew steadily, improved its ability to resist wind and tolerate fertilizer, and produced more grain. Absorbing these scientific principles, this year our county organized 50,000 deep-plowing troops, forming groups, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads as combat units, and under the unified leadership of the county party committee, launched a general offensive against the earth, mainly with the activities of squads and platoons. And put forward the resounding battle slogan "Ride rockets, take satellites, go all out for deep plowing, who is the hero, who is the good fellow, let's see in the battlefield," as a result, in only twenty days, all 360,000 mu of wheat fields in the county were deep-plowed to one chi five to three chi, which created good conditions for the robust growth of wheat.

(2) Timely sowing, uniform sowing and dense planting. "One day of winter planting is worth one season of autumn harvest." Although this sentence is not entirely accurate, it illustrates the importance of timely sowing, and it is also the crystallization of farmers' many years of experience. In particular, the "2419" wheat variety from Nanjing University is a spring-type variety with strong sensitivity. If sown too early, it will cause the stem to elongate and head before the New Year; if sown too late, the tillering rate will be poor, the growth will be weak, and the yield will be too low. Therefore, it must be sown in a timely manner. According to the sowing period experiment of the Bayi Brigade of the Dongsheng People's Commune in the plain area and the Xinshenghuo Brigade of the Xinshenghuo People's Commune in the paddy field area, this problem is also fully illustrated. In Bayi Brigade, ineffective tillers accounted for 54.5% when sown three days after the Cold Dew; ineffective tillers accounted for 35.5% when sown seven days later; ineffective tillers accounted for 22.2% when sown five days before the Frost's Descent; ineffective tillers accounted for 23.7% when sown five days later; ineffective tillers accounted for 31.78% when sown two days after the Beginning of Winter. In the Xinshenghuo Brigade, the most tillers were sown before the Cold Dew (October 3), with more than 47,400 per mu, but the number of dead plants over winter was also high, reaching 34%, with an average of 32 grains per ear; when sown before the Frost's Descent (October 13), there were 389,802 tillers per mu, with 30% of the overwintering dying, with an average of 39 grains per ear; when sown after the Frost's Descent (November 7), although there were no overwintering deaths, there were only 238,000 tillers per mu, with 29 grains per ear. From the above two typical investigation materials and the experience of large-scale bumper harvests in 1958, it can be seen that in order to achieve a bumper wheat harvest, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and sow in a timely manner. Therefore, we determined that this year's winter sowing will begin five days before the Frost's Descent and end five days later in the plain area; in the paddy field area, it will begin five days after the Cold Dew and end by the Frost's Descent; the mountainous area is cold earlier, the wheat germinates and emerges slowly, and it is still sown according to the historical experience of "White Dew sowing in high mountains, Autumn Equinox sowing in low mountains, Cold Dew sowing in plains." 40,000 mu have now been sown.

To obtain high yields, it is not enough to sow in a timely manner without increasing density. In the past, due to sparse broadcasting and sparse planting, the amount of seeds sown was small, only about seven or eight jin per mu, with 80,000 to 90,000 seedlings emerging, so each mu could only harvest one or two hundred jin. After we changed to row planting and dense planting in the winter of 1957, the amount of seeds sown per mu was increased to 20 jin (the amount in high-yield mu was increased to 30 to 36 jin), and in the spring of 1958, a large-area increase in production of 620 jin per mu was obtained. Therefore, we say that implementing row planting and dense planting and appropriately increasing the amount of seeds sown, and increasing the unit plant is an important material foundation for guaranteeing high yields. However, dense planting must retain a reasonable nutritional area to facilitate ventilation and light transmission in order to play a role in increasing yield. Therefore, this year our county's winter sowing plan is to sow an average of 30 jin per mu, with a minimum of no less than 25 jin and a maximum of no more than 35 jin (each jin of seeds has 12,000 grains, calculated at a 90% germination rate, the main root is 324,000 plants, each plant has an average of 2.5 tillers, so the average number of ears per mu can reach about 1.1 million ears). This is not too sparse or too dense, and has a certain nutritional area, so the wheat can grow well, with large ears and full grains. So, how to achieve uniform sowing and dense planting? We decided to adopt the method of repeating four times of cross-row planting with a ten-row drill and opening ditches to make compartments and sowing with a roller. Although the sowing is relatively dense, after sowing with a ten-row drill and a roller, the wheat grains are distributed very evenly, thereby maintaining a certain nutritional area, so that the wheat can grow normally.

(3) Apply sufficient base fertilizer and apply top dressing fertilizer early. Wheat has a long growing period, so in order to make it grow vigorously from beginning to end, it is necessary to apply sufficient base fertilizer and apply top dressing fertilizer early in stages. Base fertilizer should be implemented with the method of mixed fertilization and layered fertilization, so that the soil is fertile in each layer, and the fertilizer components should contain the three elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Bone meal and superphosphate should be mixed in the household fertilizer, so that wheat seedlings can grow vigorously as soon as they emerge from the soil. Top dressing should be carried out with the method of "eating more and less meals." Judging from the wheat harvested in the spring of 1958, the first application was made before and after tillering, and quick-acting fertilizer should be applied to promote tillering. This is called full-moon fertilizer. The second application should be made in winter to keep warm and prevent frost. The third application should be made at the jointing fertilizer, and in terms of time, it should not be later than the Spring Equinox. This is because after the Spring Equinox, wheat enters the small ear differentiation stage. After the ear is pregnant, multiple foliar sprays can be carried out to make the grains firm and full. In the entire growth process, a total of 150 dan of base fertilizer and 2 or 3 top dressings are applied per mu, with a total fertilizer application of 220 dan per mu. In order to make the county's 360,000 mu of wheat successfully break through the 3,000 jin barrier next year, we rushed to collect more than 300 million dan of household fertilizer and manufacture more than 100 million jin of local chemical fertilizer after the summer harvest, with an average of 1,000 dan of farm fertilizer and 1,000 jin of local chemical fertilizer applied per mu as base fertilizer. 30,000 people have now been organized to rush to send fertilizer to the fields, and three top dressings will be applied in time after the wheat seedlings emerge.

(4) Strengthen field management to ensure complete and full emergence of seedlings. Although row planting and dense planting were generally implemented last winter, and the amount of seeds sown was increased, drought during sowing, coupled with the disasters of birds, beasts and poultry, caused some areas to lack seedlings and break ridges. Later, the method of raising seedlings and replanting was adopted to make up for this loss, and complete and full emergence of seedlings was achieved. This year, in addition to paying attention to improving quality from the beginning of sowing to ensure complete and full emergence of seedlings, we will continue to adopt this method. When winter sowing is about to end, we will raise some seedlings in the empty areas of the bean fields to prevent any accidents. Can weeding be done when the wheat is dense? It seems that this is a problem. We plan not to weed some of the particularly dense wheat next year. Is it okay not to weed? Yes! This is because: (1) After the land is deeply plowed, the weeds have been removed along with the roots, and it is impossible to grow any more weeds next year; even if there are some weeds, because the wheat is dense, they cannot grow up, and may even be bullied to death. The purpose of our weeding is to loosen the soil and cut off the fibrous roots of the wheat to help it change its roots and make the seedlings grow vigorously. Now that the wheat is dense, it cannot be weeded, but as long as it is harrowed continuously several times before the straw is removed, it can play this role and make the wheat grow happily. As for other management, we have all fixed the wheat fields (land) to households according to past experience, so that we can carry out various disaster resistance work such as drought prevention, flood prevention, and insect prevention in a timely manner in the future, thereby ensuring the realization of the plan of 3,000 jin per mu of wheat.

    怎样保证全县小麦亩产三千斤？
    中共谷城县委第一书记　沈汉民
    紧张的冬播战役已经开始，谷城县为了保住红旗，明年实现三十六万亩小麦单产三千斤的规划，山区、平原、丘陵都正抓住霜降前后这一适播期，全力以赴地突击种麦。我们的口号是：“鼓足干劲创奇迹，力争上游保红旗，苦干巧干坚决干，困难压不倒英雄汉，是英雄是好汉，必须突破小麦三千斤关。”
    这一规划能不能实现呢？我们认为在党中央的英明领导和省、地委的正确指导下，只要我们能够充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性和运用发展几年来的增产经验，是完全有把握实现的。什么样的措施能够保收三千斤呢？具体来说，就是在总结1958年增产经验的基础上，死死地抓住以下五大增产环节：
      （一）深耕一尺，碎垡保墒。及时地做好整地保墒，是种好小麦的重要准备工作之一。许多农民劳动模范说的好：“秋季作物靠锄头，春季作物靠犁头。”但过去由于我们没有抓住这一点，常常因地干犁不动，犁不深，耙不碎，而造成出苗不齐，影响产量的提高。去年我们接受了这个教训，采取了黄一块，收一块，收一块，犁一块的随犁随耙方法，同时推广了沈湾乡乐民社创造的纵横深犁，交叉耙地，碎垡保墒的经验。秋季作物收获后，随即浅耕揭坂三至五寸，迎墒铣耙一遍，炕六、七天后，又横犁第二次，耕层加深五、六寸，接着直耙一遍，第三、四道逐渐浅犁，使土壤疏松，从而保证了麦苗健壮的生长。这是因为深耕后不仅普遍消灭了暗埂，增加了土壤利用层，使地下土层经过炕土风化，促进肥料分解，增加了土壤肥力。而且由于耕层深，小麦的根系生长范围广，扎的也深。根系健壮发育的结果，分蘖率就相应的增加。这样一来，就使小麦生长稳固，提高抗风耐肥能力，增产更多的粮食。吸取这些科学道理，今年我们全县组织了五万深翻大军，组成团、营、连、排、班若干个战斗单位，在县委的统一领导下，以班、排活动为主的向地球发起了总攻势。并提出了响亮的“驾火箭，乘卫星，全力以赴搞深耕，谁是英雄谁好汉，战场之中比比看”的战斗口号，结果仅二十天的时间，全县三十六万亩小麦田，都深耕到一尺五到三尺，这就为小麦健壮的生长创造了良好的条件。
      （二）适时播种，匀播密植。“冬种一日，秋收一时”这句话虽不太确切，但它说明了适时播种的重要性，同时这也是农民多年来经验的结晶。特别是南大“二四一九”属于春性品种，敏感性强，如果播种过早，就会造成年前拔节抽穗；播种过迟，分蘖率差，生长细弱，产量太低。因此，必须适时播种。据平原地区东升人民公社八一大队和水田区新生活人民公社新生活大队播种期试验，也充分说明了这个问题。八一大队寒露后三天播种的，无效分蘖占54.5％，后七天播种的无效分蘖占35.5％，霜降前五天播种的无效分蘖占22.2％，后五天的无效分蘖占23.7％，立冬后两天的无效分蘖占31.78％。新生活大队寒露前（10月3日）播种的分蘖最多，每亩四万七千四百多根，但过冬枯死的也多，达34％，每穗平均三十二粒，霜降前（10月13日）播种的每亩有三十八万九千八百零二根，越冬枯死的有30％，每穗平均三十九粒；霜降后（11月7日）播种的，越冬虽未枯死，每亩只有二十三万八千根，每穗二十九粒；从上述这两个典型调查材料和1958年大面积丰收的经验来看，要使小麦丰收，必须因地制宜，适时播种。因此，我们确定今年的冬播时，平原地区从霜降前五天开始，后五天结束；水田地区寒露后五天开始到霜降结束；山区冷的早，麦子发芽出土慢，仍是按照历史经验“白露种高山，秋分种低山，寒露种平川”的规律播种。现已播种了四万亩。
    要获得高产，光播种适时，不增加密度也不行。过去由于撒播稀植，下种量就少，每亩只合七、八斤种，出苗八、九万株，因此每亩只能收一、二百斤。1957年冬播我们改条播密植后，每亩下种量二十斤（丰产亩增加到三十到三十六斤），1958年春就获得了单产六百二十斤的大面积增产。所以，我们说，实行条播密植，适当增加下种量，增加单位植株，是保证高产的重要物质基础。但密植必须保留合理的营养面积，便于通风透光，才能起到增产作用。因此，我县今年冬播计划每亩平均下种量三十斤，最低不少于二十五斤，最高不超过三十五斤（每斤种子为一万二千粒，按90％发芽率计算，主根为三十二万四千株，每株平均分蘖二点五根，这样每亩平均穗数可达到一百一十万穗左右）。这样不稀不密，有一定营养面积，麦子就能长得好，穗子大，籽粒饱满。那么，如何达到匀播密植呢？我们决定采取十行条播机重复四次交叉条播和开沟作厢用滚播器播种的方法，这样虽然播种的比较密，但通过十行条播机和滚播器播种以后，麦粒分布得很均匀，从而保持了一定的营养面积，使小麦能正常生长。
      （三）施足基肥，早施追肥。小麦生长期很长，因此要使它从始至终都能健壮地生长，必须施足底肥和及早分期追肥。底肥要贯彻混合施肥，分层施肥的方法，使土壤中层层有肥，而且肥料的成分要含有氮、磷、钾三要素，家肥里面应有骨粉、过磷酸钙掺合，这样可以使麦苗一出土就能抓住肥劲健壮生长。追肥应采取“多吃少餐”的办法进行施肥，从1958年春季收成的小麦来看，都是在分蘖前后施第一次，要施速效性肥料，促进分蘖，这叫作满月肥。冬季施第二次，以保暖防冻。第三次施拔节肥，从时间上来说，应不迟于春分。这是因为春分后小麦，即到了小穗分化阶段。孕穗以后，可进行多次的根外喷肥，使籽粒结实饱满。全部生长过程中，每亩共施底肥一百五十担，追肥二、三次，每亩施肥达到二百二十担。为使全县三十六万亩小麦明年胜利闯过三千斤关，我们在夏收后曾突击积攒了三亿多担家肥，制造土化肥一亿多斤，平均每亩施基肥农家肥料一千担，土化肥一千斤。现已组织了三万人突击送肥下地，麦苗出土后再及时的进行三次追肥。
    （四）加强田间管理，保证齐苗全苗。去冬虽然普遍实行了条播密植，增加了下种量，但由于播种时干旱，加之鸟兽家禽的灾害曾造成部分地缺苗断垅现象，后来采取了育苗补栽的方法，才弥补了这一损失，而达到了齐苗全苗。今年我们除了从播种开始就注意提高质量，保证齐苗全苗外，将继续采取这种办法，在冬播将要结束的时候，在豆地空的地育一部分苗，以防万一。麦子密了能不能锄草呢？看来这是一个问题，我们打算明年对一部分特密的麦子不再锄草了。不锄草行不行呢？行！这是因为：（一）土地深耕以后，杂草已连根除掉，下年不可能再长什么杂草；即便是有点把草，由于小麦密它也长不起来，甚至会把它欺死。我们锄草的目的是为了松土和切断小麦的须根，帮助它换根，使苗健壮的生长。现在小麦密了不能锄，可是只要在元秆以前用耙连续耙几次即可起到这个作用，而使小麦痛痛快快地长。至于其它管理，我们都已经按照以往的经验把麦田
  （地）固定到户了，以便今后能够及时地进行防旱、防涝、防虫等各种抗灾工作，从而确保小麦单产三千斤规划的实现。
