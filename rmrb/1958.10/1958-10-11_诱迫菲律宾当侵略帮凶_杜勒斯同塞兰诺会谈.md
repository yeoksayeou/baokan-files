Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held talks with Philippine Foreign Minister Serrano on the afternoon of October 8th. This is another action by the U.S. government to entice and coerce its vassal states to support its policies of aggression and provocation in the Taiwan Strait area.

The communique issued after the talks stated that Dulles and Serrano discussed the situation in the Far East. The communique slandered the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands as "aggression," and fabricated the claim that the situation in the Taiwan Strait "may affect the security of the Philippines."

Despite the fact that the U.S. government's playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait has caused serious unease in the Philippines, the communique stated that the Philippine side expressed support for the U.S.'s aggressive policy.

Dulles and Serrano also discussed strengthening the Philippines' military strength and U.S. military assistance. Sources say that the U.S. has agreed to accelerate the shipment of military materials such as jet aircraft, motorized vehicles, and patrol boats to the Philippines in order to accelerate the Philippines' military expansion plan, exacerbate tensions in the Far East, and threaten the security of other countries.

    诱迫菲律宾当侵略帮凶
    杜勒斯同塞兰诺会谈
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯8日下午同菲律宾外交部长塞兰诺举行会谈，这是美国政府为了引诱和胁迫它的仆从国支持它在台湾海峡地区的侵略、挑衅政策的又一行动。
    会谈后发表的公报说，杜勒斯和塞兰诺讨论了远东的局势。公报污蔑中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的决心是“侵略”，并且无中生有地硬说台湾海峡局势“可能影响到菲律宾的安全”。
    尽管美国政府在台湾海峡的玩火在菲律宾已引起严重不安，但公报却说，菲律宾方面表示支持美国的侵略政策。
    杜勒斯和塞兰诺还讨论了加强菲律宾的军事力量和美国的军事援助问题。有消息说，美国同意加速向菲律宾运送喷气飞机、摩托化车辆和巡逻艇等军事物资，以便加速菲律宾的扩军计划，加剧远东紧张局势和威胁其他国家的安全。
