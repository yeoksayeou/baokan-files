In the Great Leap Forward of agricultural production, people have further recognized the importance of close planting. The emergence of many high-yield "satellites" and large-scale bumper harvest records all prove that as long as close planting is combined with measures such as deep plowing, water conservancy, fertilizer, and improved varieties, the yield of crops can be greatly increased. Since this summer, closely planted wheat, early rice, and mid-season rice have all achieved high yield increases; now, the growth of closely planted late rice is also very good. These facts have made many people who originally opposed close planting and advocated sparse planting have to admit the superiority of close planting.

The close planting adopted in many places this year is not ordinary close planting, but a high degree of close planting. That is to say, the same piece of land now grows twice, twice as much, or even many times more crops than in the past, and generally grows very well. The success of highly dense planting has further liberated people's minds. How many crops can be grown per mu, and how much product can be produced? Since ancient times, people have explored this issue, but due to various limitations, people have always underestimated the yield potential of the land. No one has ever dared to implement highly dense planting like Chinese farmers today, obtaining thousands or tens of thousands of catties of grain from one mu of land. In the face of the facts of high-yield production created by Chinese farmers, the fallacy of the "law of diminishing returns" invented by bourgeois scholars has completely gone bankrupt.

It can be seen that the widespread promotion of close planting methods in this year's production is not accidental. It is certain that with the improvement of water, fertilizer, soil, seed and other conditions, close planting methods will be further developed in the future. The question now is how to better promote close planting methods.

In promoting close planting measures, the general practice is to sow or transplant seedlings according to certain close planting specifications and standards based on water, fertilizer, soil, seed and other conditions; after close planting, meticulously carry out field management to ensure that the dense crops develop smoothly and mature, and strive for a bumper harvest. This close planting method should be greatly promoted.

In a few places, there is another approach, which is "transplanting seedlings" and "merging seedlings" (in some places it is called "parasitic seedlings"). Specifically, it means that shortly before the crops (usually rice) head, the crops from many fields are transplanted into one field, greatly increasing the density of crops per unit area. This can free up some land to grow other crops. In the past, before early rice heading, in order to wait for water and land and avoid thin and old seedlings, this method was used to increase yield. This year, some rice producing areas, in order to combat drought or to free up land to plant late rice early, carried out "merging seedlings" before early rice heading. This can also increase total grain production. In late rice producing areas, the method of "merging seedlings" is also used to fight drought. For example, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, has experienced a severe drought since the summer this year, and 70,000 mu of late rice has no water to save. The county party committee led various agricultural cooperatives to "move" these 70,000 mu of late rice and transplant them into 7,000 mu of fields with water sources, increasing the density by nine times. It is estimated that doing so will increase production by 28 million catties of grain compared to not transplanting, ensuring the completion of the original production plan. In areas where rice and wheat are double-cropped, this method is also used. For example, before the wheat is harvested, the late-season rice seedlings are "parasitized" in other fields; after the wheat is harvested, the rice seedlings are transplanted back to their own fields. This way, the farming season will not be missed, and increased production of late-maturing rice can be achieved.

Recently, some places have adopted a late-stage transplanting method similar to "transplanting seedlings" in early rice fields or late rice fields. These places also sowed or transplanted seedlings according to the requirements of close planting at the beginning. Later, inspired by the high-yield "satellites" that appeared in other places, they saw that their crops were not as dense as others, so in the later stage of crop growth, when the crops were heading or had already headed, they temporarily transplanted the crops from several fields densely into an experimental field. This approach is valuable from the perspective of scientific experiments, but whether it needs to be universally promoted under current conditions is worth studying. Late-stage transplanted fields are not completely closely planted fields, because the transplanted crops have spent most of their growing period in other fields, and they can only complete a very short period of life after being moved to new fields, such as some fields that are harvested ten days after transplanting. For such crops, it is of course impossible to comprehensively observe the entire process of their growth and development. Therefore, the close planting experience gained in such experimental fields is also incomplete and difficult to use to guide the production of general farmland today. Furthermore, late-stage transplanting requires a lot of manpower. After late-stage transplanting, some experimental fields are so dense that it can be said that "water cannot pass through," and if artificial lighting and air supply measures are not taken, some crops will wither. Doing so requires a lot of manpower. Under normal circumstances, it is better not to adopt this kind of late-stage seedling merging that is too late when promoting close planting.

    水稻后期并秧值得研究
    孙渊
    农业生产大跃进中，人们进一步认识到了密植的重要作用。许多高产“卫星”和大面积丰产纪录的出现，都证明：只要使密植跟深耕、水利、肥料、优良品种等措施配合起来，就能大大增加农作物的产量。今年夏季以来，凡是密植的小麦、早稻、中稻都已经获得了高额增产效果；现在，密植晚稻的生长情况也很好。这些事实使得许多原来反对密植、主张稀植的人也不得不承认密植的优越性。
    今年许多地方采用的密植，不是一般的密植，而是高度的密植。就是说，同样一块田，现在长出了比过去多一倍、两倍以至好多倍的庄稼，而且一般都长得很好。高度密植的成功，使人们进一步解放了思想。一亩地究竟能养多少庄稼，能产出多少产品？从古时候起，人们就探讨过这个问题，但是，由于各种条件的限制，人们总是把土地的增产潜力估计得很低。从来没有人像今天我国的农民这样大胆地实行高度密植，从一亩地上获得了几千斤几万斤的粮食。在我国农民所创造的高额丰产的事实面前，资产阶级学者发明的“土地肥力递减法则”的谬论彻底破产了。
    可见密植方法在今年的生产中得到这样普遍的推广，并不是偶然的。可以肯定，随着水、肥、土、种等条件的改善，密植方法在今后会得到进一步的发展。现在的问题是如何更好地推广密植方法。
    在推行密植措施当中，一般的做法是：根据水肥土种等条件，按照一定的密植规格和标准播种或栽秧；密植之后细致地进行田间管理，保证稠密的庄稼顺利地发育成熟，争取大丰收。这种密植方法，应该大加提倡。
    在少数地方也有另外一种做法，就是“掇秧”、“并秧”（有的地方叫“寄秧”）。具体说来，就是在庄稼（一般是水稻）出穗前不久，把许多块田里的庄稼移植到一块田里，大大增加了单位面积上的庄稼密度，这样做可以腾出一些田地种别的庄稼。过去在早稻出穗以前，为了等水等田，避免秧苗瘦老，采用这个办法，可以提高产量。今年有些水稻产区为了战胜旱灾，或者为了腾出土地，早栽晚稻，在早稻抽穗以前进行“并秧”。这样做也能增加粮食总产量。在晚稻产区，也有采用“并秧”的办法抗旱的。如江西省宜春县今年入夏以来发生了大旱，有七万亩晚稻无水可救。县委领导各个农业社把这七万亩晚稻“搬家”，移植到有水源的七千亩田里，使密度增加了九倍，估计这样做比不移植可增产二千八百万斤粮食，保证原定生产计划的完成。在稻麦两熟地区，也有采用这个办法的。如在小麦收割前，把后茬的水稻秧苗“寄”在别的田里；等小麦收割后再把水稻秧苗移植到本田里。这样就可以不误农时，争取晚熟水稻增产。
    最近时期有些地方在早稻田或晚稻田采用了一种与“掇秧”类似的后期移植的办法。这些地方在开始的时候，也曾按照密植的要求播了种或栽了秧，后来受到别的地方出现的高额丰产“卫星”的鼓舞，看到自己的庄稼不如人家的密，于是在庄稼生长后期，当庄稼正在出穗或者已经出穗的时候，临时把几块田里的庄稼稠密地移植到一块试验田里。这种做法，从科学试验的角度看，是有价值的，但是在目前条件下是否需要普遍提倡，还值得研究。后期移植的田并不是完全的密植田，因为移来的庄稼已经在别的田里度过了大部分的生长期，而移到新的田里它们只能完成很短的一段生命，如有的田移植十来天后就收获了。对于这样的庄稼，当然不可能全面地观察它们的全部生长发育的过程。因而在这样的试验田里所获得的密植经验，也就不完整，在今天很难用来指导一般农田的生产。再说后期移植要耗费大量的人工。有的试验田经过后期移植以后，庄稼密得可说是“水泄不通”，不采取人工照明和送风等措施，部分庄稼就会枯萎。而要这样做，又必须花去很大的人工。在通常情况下推行密植，还是以不采取这种时间过晚的后期并秧为好。
