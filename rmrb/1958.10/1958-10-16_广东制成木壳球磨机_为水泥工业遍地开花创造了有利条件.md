    Guangdong Manufactures Wooden Shell Ball Mill
    Creating Favorable Conditions for the Blooming of Cement Industry Everywhere
    (Reported by this newspaper) A wooden shell ball mill for use in small cement plants has recently been successfully manufactured in Guangdong Province. It provides favorable conditions for the widespread blooming of the cement industry.
    The wooden shell ball mill uses five-centimeter-thick hardwood for the shell, inlaid with a two-and-a-half-centimeter-thick corrugated cast iron wear layer. It has an inner diameter of 940 millimeters, a ball mill barrel length of 1,800 millimeters, and the barrel contains cast iron balls and rods for grinding. Driven by a 14-kilowatt motor, it can produce 10 tons of cement per day, which can meet the grinding needs of a small cement plant with an annual output of 3,000 tons.
    The wooden shell ball mill was created by the Guangdong Provincial Native Cement Research and Promotion Group using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Its greatest feature is that it overcomes the shortcomings of low efficiency, high cost, and excessive consumption of human and animal power in native grinding methods, while saving a large amount of steel and iron materials. At the same time, the technical requirements for production are not high, and ordinary agricultural machinery factories in small towns can manufacture it.
    This research and promotion group is also studying the use of granite components to replace corrugated cast iron as the wear layer.

    广东制成木壳球磨机
    为水泥工业遍地开花创造了有利条件
    本报讯　供小型水泥厂生产使用的木壳球磨机最近在广东省制造成功。它为水泥工业遍地开花提供了有利条件。
    木壳球磨机是用五公分厚的硬木做筒壳，内镶二点五公分厚的波型铸铁磨损层，内径九百四十公厘，球磨筒长一千八百公厘，筒内盛有磨碎用的生铁球棒。它由十四瓩的马达带动，每天能生产水泥十吨，可以满足年产三千吨的小型水泥厂的研磨需要。
    木壳球磨机是由广东省土法水泥研究推广小组采用土洋结合的办法创制的。它的最大特点是克服了土法研磨效率低、成本高、人畜力耗用过大等缺点，节省了大量钢材和铁料。同时，制作技术要求不高，一般小城镇的普通农械厂可以制造。
    这个研究推广小组还在研究用花岗石制件代替波型铸铁作磨损层。
