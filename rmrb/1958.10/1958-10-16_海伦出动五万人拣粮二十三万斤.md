In order to ensure the quality of the autumn harvest and achieve complete grain storage, Hailun County in Heilongjiang Province launched a county-wide grain gleaning campaign. By October 5th, over 58,000 people had participated in the gleaning movement, collecting a total of more than 230,000 jin of grain.

Hailun County's 213,630 hectares of field crops were harvested by September 30th. After the county, township, and commune-organized autumn harvest inspection teams conducted in-depth inspections of the fields, it was discovered that some areas had instances of plants being pulled up, ears of grain being dropped, fallen stalks, and grain loss. The county party committee immediately called on all farmers in the county to glean all the harvested land to ensure that every grain was returned to the granary. The commune members of all people's communes in the county responded to this call. In addition to organizing commune members to glean grain, many communes also mobilized elderly people, women, and children to form grain gleaning teams to go to all the harvested fields to glean the grain.

    海伦出动五万人拣粮二十三万斤
    黑龙江省海伦县为了保证秋收质量，做到颗粒还仓，掀起了全县范围的拣粮高潮，到10月5日全县已有五万八千多人参加了拣粮运动，共拣了二十三万多斤粮食。
    海伦县二十一万三千六百三十公顷大田作物在9月30日收割完毕，经县、乡、社组织的秋收检查团深入田间检查，发现有些地有拉棵、丢穗、掉码、掉粒现象。县委立即向全县农民提出了把收割完的地全部拣一遍，作到颗粒归仓。全县各人民公社的社员响应了这一号召，很多公社除了组织社员拣粮外，还动员了老年人、妇女、儿童编成拣粮队，到全部收割完的田地里拣一遍粮。
