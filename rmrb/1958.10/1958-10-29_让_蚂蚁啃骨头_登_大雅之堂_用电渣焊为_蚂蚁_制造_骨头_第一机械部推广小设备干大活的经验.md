Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 27th: The First Ministry of Machine Building held an on-site conference in Shenyang from the 20th to the 25th. More than 1,600 worker representatives from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country participated. They deeply studied and exchanged experiences in "using small equipment to do big jobs."

Judging from the information reflected at this conference, the "ants gnawing bones" experience has been widely promoted throughout the country. Not only do many small machinery factories use this experience to process large parts, but also some heavy machinery factories with large equipment use this experience to manufacture larger and more complex machines. The experiences of using small equipment to do big jobs in various regions can be roughly divided into five categories. The first category is improving fixtures so that machine tools can process parts they cannot process. The second category is modifying existing machine tools or moving the position of machine tools to achieve the purpose of being able to process large parts. The third category is adopting temporary process equipment to flexibly process some special parts, and the equipment can still be disassembled and replaced to process other parts after processing. The fourth category is manufacturing special simple machine tools to process certain complex large parts. The fifth category is organizing multiple special native machine tools to process a very large part simultaneously. By adopting the "ants gnawing bones" experience, various large and precise machines have been manufactured in various regions. Some of these machines are large smelting and rolling equipment, and some are complex heavy forging and pressing equipment and power station equipment. Factories that have promoted this experience have not only manufactured machines that could not be manufactured in the past but have also armed themselves with self-made machine tool equipment (such as special machine tools, simple native machine tools, etc.), making themselves factories capable of manufacturing large machines with a variety of equipment.

Facts have proven that the "ants gnawing bones" experience is not a temporary and dispensable measure, but a relatively long-term direction for the development of the machinery industry. It is not a backward method that is "rustic" and "does not enter the hall of elegance," as some people say, but an advanced method with a high level of technology. The emergence of this experience marks that the technical level of China's machinery processing has entered a new stage. This conference criticized the erroneous view of underestimating this experience and reiterated that all machinery factories across the country should actively promote this experience according to their own circumstances, so that this experience can shine brightly.

This conference also discussed how to find "bones" for "ants." Due to the shortage of large casting and forging equipment in our country, the supply of many large castings and forgings is insufficient. This has led to a situation where "ants" have no "bones" to gnaw. The conference believes that the most effective way to solve this contradiction is to promote the electroslag welding method. Electroslag welding can weld several small and light castings and forgings into large and heavy castings and forgings. Some factories have already used electroslag welding methods to weld out a variety of large blanks. The quality and performance of these blanks are the same as those of whole large castings and forgings. Therefore, the conference believes that the widespread promotion of the electroslag welding experience is an important path to develop the production of heavy machinery blanks in a faster, better, and more economical way in the future, and it is also an effective measure to solve the current shortage of large casting and forging equipment.

    让“蚂蚁啃骨头”登“大雅之堂”  用电渣焊为“蚂蚁”制造“骨头”
    第一机械部推广小设备干大活的经验
    据新华社沈阳27日电　第一机械工业部20日到25日在沈阳举行现场会议，参加的有全国二十七个省、市、自治区的职工代表一千六百多人。他们深入地学习和交流了“小设备干大活”的经验。
    从这次会议反映的情况看，目前全国各地已普遍推广“蚂蚁啃骨头”经验，不但许多小型机械工厂采用这一经验来加工大部件；就是一些拥有大型设备的重型机械工厂，也采用这一经验制造出更大、更复杂的机器。各地用小设备干大活的经验大体上可以分为五类。第一类是改进夹具，使机床能够加工它不能加工的部件；第二类是改装现有机床，或者是移动机床的位置，来达到能够加工大部件的目的；第三类是采取临时的工艺装置，灵活地加工一些特殊的部件，加工以后仍可拆换加工别种部件；第四类是制造专用的简易机床，加工某种复杂的大部件；第五类是组织多台专用的土机床，同时加工一种很大的部件。各地采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”经验，已经制成了各种各样的大型精密的机器。这些机器有的是大型冶炼、轧钢设备，有的是复杂的重型锻压设备和电站设备。凡是推广了这一经验的工厂，不但制成了过去不能制造的机器，而且也用自制的机床设备（如专用机床、简易土机床等）来武装自己，使自己成为拥有多种设备的能够制造大机器的工厂。
    事实证明：“蚂蚁啃骨头”的经验，不是一种什么临时性的可有可无的措施，而是一种比较长远的发展机械工业的方向；不是一种像有些人所说的“土里土气”的“不登大雅之堂”的落后方法，而是一种具有较高的技术水平的先进方法。这种经验的出现，标帜着我国机械加工的技术水平已经迈进了一个新阶段，这次会议批判了轻视这一经验的错误观点，并且再次提出：全国所有机械工厂都要根据自己的情况，积极推广这一经验，使这一经验大放光彩。
    这次会议还讨论了怎样替“蚂蚁”找“骨头”的问题。由于我国大型铸造、锻压设备不足，许多大铸件、大锻件供应不足。这样就出现了“蚂蚁”没有“骨头”啃的情况。会议认为，解决这个矛盾最有效的办法是推广电渣焊的方法。电渣焊可以把若干小的轻的铸件、锻件，拼焊成大的重的铸件、锻件。现在有些工厂已经利用电渣焊的方法拼焊出多种大型的毛胚。这些毛胚的质量和性能都和整块的大铸件、大锻件一样。因此，会议认为广泛推广电渣焊的经验，是今后多快好省地发展重型机械毛胚生产的重要道路，也是解决当前大型铸造、锻压设备不足的有效措施。
