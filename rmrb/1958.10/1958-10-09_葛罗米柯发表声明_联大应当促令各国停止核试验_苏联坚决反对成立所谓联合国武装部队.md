Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th – According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The head of the Soviet delegation to the Thirteenth Session of the UN General Assembly, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, issued a statement at a press conference in New York on the 7th, pointing out that the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing is an important task facing the current session of the General Assembly. He also stated: The Soviet Union firmly opposes the American trick of establishing so-called UN armed forces.

Gromyko stressed that the Western countries disregard the demands of the peoples of the world and repeatedly delay the implementation of this measure. Judging from certain statements by the US and British governments, as well as speeches by the heads of the two countries' delegations at the current session of the UN General Assembly, the governments of these two countries still do not want to undertake the obligation to cease nuclear weapon testing.

Gromyko went on to say that the most peculiar statement on this issue at the current session of the UN General Assembly was the statement by the French Foreign Minister. From his statement, it can be seen that the French government is single-mindedly trying to continue to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of testing, and it is attempting to get its hands on atomic bombs as soon as possible.

Referring to the Soviet government's proposal that the upcoming meeting in Geneva should be a meeting of foreign ministers of the countries concerned, Gromyko expressed the hope that the US and British governments would adopt a positive attitude towards this proposal. He pointed out that since the two countries have announced their willingness to work towards an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapon testing, but at the same time do not agree to hold a ministerial meeting, or are looking for various excuses to delay this meeting, this does not make sense.

Gromyko expressed his belief that the vast majority of delegates to the General Assembly believe that the issue of the cessation of nuclear weapon testing is of great significance. If all major powers advocating such testing immediately stopped testing, then no government could ignore this issue.

The head of the Soviet delegation also spoke about the issue of establishing so-called UN armed forces.

He said that from all indications, the US government is determined to secretly realize its attempt to establish so-called UN armed forces in some form by all means. In order to confuse some gullible people, they have even come up with a new name for these armed forces, calling them "peace forces." However, the truth of the matter is to establish an armed force that is actually controlled by the United States and its allies in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. This force will be used to achieve goals that have nothing to do with the purposes of the United Nations, and first and foremost, it will be used to deal with small countries.

Gromyko said that no one can say for sure that if the kind of UN forces that are now being proposed existed, there would not now be US and British troops wearing UN shoulder patches stationed in Lebanon and Jordan. Moreover, even if the troops of other members of the Western countries' aggressive bloc were used to replace the US and British troops stationed there, would the situation change substantially? Of course, there would be no change. In addition, the examples of Lebanon and Jordan also show that the troops who land on the orders of Washington and London have a much stronger desire to invade the territory of other countries than to leave those countries.

The Soviet Foreign Minister finally said that the Soviet Union firmly opposes the US government's proposed method of establishing UN armed forces, because this method is contrary to the UN Charter, the organization's principles of peace, and the interests of peace.

    葛罗米柯发表声明
    联大应当促令各国停止核试验
    苏联坚决反对成立所谓联合国武装部队
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国大会第十三届会议的苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部长葛罗米柯7日在纽约举行的记者招待会上发表声明，指出停止试验原子武器和氢武器是大会本届会议面临的一个重要任务。他还声明：苏联坚决反对成立所谓联合国武装部队的美国诡计。
    葛罗米柯着重指出，西方国家漠视世界各国人民的要求，一再拖延实现这一措施。从美国和英国政府的某些声明以及两国代表团负责人在目前的联合国大会会议上的发言看来，这两国的政府今后仍然不想承担停止试验核武器的义务。
    葛罗米柯接着说，在联合国大会本届会议上，对这个问题最奇特的发言是法国外交部长的发言。从他的发言中可以看出，法国政府一心一意想继续阻挠达成关于停止试验的协议，它企图尽快地把原子弹弄到自己的手里。
    在谈到苏联政府关于即将在日内瓦举行的会议应该是各有关国家外交部长级会议的建议时，葛罗米柯表示希望美国和英国政府对这个建议采取积极的态度。他指出，两国既然已经宣布愿意努力达成停止试验核武器的协议，而同时又不同意举行部长级会议，或者是寻找各种借口来拖延这个会议，这是说不通的。
    葛罗米柯表示相信，大会绝大多数代表都认为停止试验核武器问题具有重大意义。如果大会主张进行这种试验的所有大国都立即停止试验，那末，任何一国政府对这个问题都不能不加以考虑。
    苏联代表团团长还谈到了建立所谓联合国武装部队的问题。
    他说，从各方面来看，美国政府决心不择一切手段地在某种形式下偷偷实现它的建立所谓联合国武装部队的企图。为了迷惑一些轻信的人，甚至还替这些武装部队想出一种新的名称，叫什么“和平部队”。但是，问题的真相在于要建立一支实际上是由美国和它在北大西洋侵略集团中的盟国操纵的武装部队。这支部队将被用来实现同联合国宗旨毫不相干的目的，首先是用来对付小国。
    葛罗米柯说，谁也不能肯定地说，如果当前存在着像现在所建议成立的那种联合国部队，现在在黎巴嫩和约旦境内就不会驻扎戴着联合国肩章的美英军队了。而且，即使以西方国家侵略集团其他成员国的士兵来代替美英军队驻在那里，难道情况就会有实质的改变吗？当然不会有改变。此外，黎巴嫩和约旦的例子还说明，根据华盛顿和伦敦的命令而登陆的军队，它们想侵入其他国家的领土的愿望要比想离开这些国家的愿望强烈得多。
    苏联外交部长最后说，苏联坚决反对美国政府提出的成立联合国武装部队的办法，因为这种办法是同联合国宪章、同这个组织的和平原则以及同和平的利益相矛盾的。
