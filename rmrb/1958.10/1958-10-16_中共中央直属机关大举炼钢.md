Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The "small indigenous groups" steelmaking movement in the central government directly affiliated organs has been vigorously launched, and steel production has been increasing continuously in the past five days.

Each unit is led by the Party Committee Secretary, with leading cadres taking the lead in person. Competitions have been launched between units, groups, and individuals. The slogans they have put forward are: "Hold high the red flag, start from scratch, delve into steelmaking techniques, and be sure to release steel flowers!" "Refine our own thoughts in steelmaking." The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after two days and two nights of hard work, finally produced the first furnace of steel. Chen Boda, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, also smashed coke and iron with the masses. He praised steelmaking as "this is a heroic undertaking." Zeng Shan, Minister of the Communications Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Gao Yang, Deputy Minister of the Industry Work Department, Wang Fu and Shuai Mengqi, Deputy Ministers of the Organization Department, Gong Zirong and Deng Diantao, Deputy Directors of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others also participated in steelmaking work with the masses.

In the steelmaking movement, all units relied on their own efforts to solve the difficulties of insufficient raw materials such as pig iron and coke in every possible way. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses to donate iron and clean up warehouses, and has collected tens of thousands of catties of scrap iron. The Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Finance and Trade Work Department, and the Supervisory Committee have collected more than 20,000 catties of scrap iron in five days and established a dry distillation furnace that can produce 4,500 catties of coke per day.

In order to push the steelmaking movement to a higher climax, all units are doing everything possible to expand steelmaking equipment. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has begun to prepare to manufacture its own crucibles. The Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and other three units already have a reverberatory furnace and are preparing to build another 2,000-pound small converter. In addition to the existing crucibles, the People's Daily is also preparing to build a reverberatory furnace and a small converter. In order to better master steelmaking technology, the Party Committee of the Central Government Directly Affiliated Organs has sent people to Tianjin to learn from the advanced experience of indigenous steelmaking methods. At present, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Organization Department, the Finance and Trade Work Department, the Supervisory Committee, and other units are contributing their skills and iron day and night, working hard, and preparing to launch high-yield steelmaking "satellites" in the near future.

### 中共中央直属机关大举炼钢

    中共中央直属机关大举炼钢
    新华社14日讯　中共中央直属机关各单位的“小土群”炼钢运动已经蓬勃展开，五天来钢的产量在不断上升。
    各单位均由党委书记挂帅，领导干部亲自出马，单位与单位、小组与小组、个人与个人之间展开了竞赛，他们提出的口号是：“高举红旗，白手起家，深钻炼钢术，定要放钢花。”“要在炼钢中炼自己的思想”。中共中央宣传部经过两天两夜苦战，终于炼出了第一炉钢。中共中央政治局候补委员、宣传部副部长陈伯达也和群众一起砸焦砸铁，他把炼钢誉之为“这是英雄的事业”。中共中央交通工作部部长曾山，工业工作部副部长高扬，组织部副部长王甫、帅孟奇，中共中央办公厅副主任龚子荣、邓典桃等都和群众一起参加了炼钢工作。
    在炼钢运动中，各单位都自力更生，千方百计解决生铁、焦炭等原料不足的困难。中共中央宣传部发动群众献铁，清理仓库，已收集到几万斤废铁。中共中央组织部、财政贸易工作部、监察委员会三个单位在五天内已收集到废铁二万多斤，并建立了一座干馏炉，每天能炼出四千五百斤焦炭。
    为了把炼钢运动推向更高潮，各单位都在尽一切可能扩充炼钢设备。中华全国总工会已着手准备自己制造坩埚。中共中央组织部等三个单位已有一座反射炉，还准备再建一个二千斤的小转炉。人民日报除已有的坩锅外，也在着手修建反射炉和小转炉。为了更好地掌握炼钢技术，中共中央直属机关党委已派人到天津学习土法炼钢的先进经验。目前，中共中央宣传部、组织部、财政贸易工作部、监察委员会等单位正在人人献技、献铁，日夜苦战，准备在最近期间放射炼钢高产“卫星”。
