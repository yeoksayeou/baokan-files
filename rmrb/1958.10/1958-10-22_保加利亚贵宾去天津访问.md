    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 21st: The Bulgarian National Assembly delegation, headed by Chervenkov, flew to Tianjin from Shanghai by special plane this afternoon. Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xu Jianguo, Song Richang, and Rong Yiren, Vice Mayors of Shanghai, and others went to the airport to see them off.
    After arriving in Shanghai on the 18th, the distinguished guests visited the printing and dyeing factory, the Gold Pen Factory, the steam turbine factory, the Shanghai Revolutionary History Memorial Hall, and the Former Residence of Sun Yat-sen, where they were warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere.
    Chervenkov said at a mass rally held at the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory: The Bulgarian people are extremely concerned about everything in China, and we deeply love and respect the Chinese people. He said: Advancing on the road of communism is not a pleasant stroll on a smooth road. There will be many difficulties to overcome. We have personally seen how the Chinese people are working hard to overcome these difficulties. We believe that victory belongs to the Chinese people and to the socialist camp. Imperialism has no future and is doomed to perish. The Party Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory Committee thanked Chervenkov for his encouragement on behalf of all the factory's employees and exchanged gifts with the distinguished guests.

    保加利亚贵宾去天津访问
    新华社上海21日电　以契尔文科夫为首的保加利亚国民议会代表团今天下午乘专机离上海飞往天津。中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显，上海市副市长许建国、宋日昌、荣毅仁等到机场欢送。
    贵宾们18日到达上海以后，先后参观了印染厂、金笔厂、汽轮机厂和上海革命历史纪念馆、中山故居等处，到处受到群众热烈的欢迎。
    契尔文科夫在上海汽轮机厂举行的群众欢迎大会上讲话说：保加利亚人民极其关心中国的一切事情，我们深深地爱戴和尊敬中国人民。他说：在共产主义大道上前进，并不是在平坦的道路上舒畅地散步，会有许多困难需要克服，我们亲眼看到中国人民正在如何努力地克服这些困难。我们相信，胜利属于中国人民，属于社会主义阵营。帝国主义是没有前途，是注定要灭亡的。上海汽轮机厂的党委书记和副书记代表全厂职工感谢契尔文科夫的鼓励，并和贵宾们互相赠送了礼品。
