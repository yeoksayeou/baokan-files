    "Budding Sprouts" Magazine Editorial Department

    On September 21st, under the care and guidance of the Party, all members of our "Budding Sprouts" editorial department, carrying our bedding and luggage, moved into the first people's commune in the suburbs of Shanghai – the "July 1st" People's Commune.

    Although we have only been down here for a week, the soaring production enthusiasm of the peasant brothers has given us a profound communist education. When we passed through Qibao Town (where the commune office is located), we saw more than a hundred commanders and fighters of the youth "satellite" battalion deep plowing the land in "trenches" nearly one-person deep, preparing to launch a wheat yield "satellite" next year. They put forward the bold slogan of "winning the national championship and setting a world record!" Around our residence, from dawn to late at night, we could hear the laughter and chatter of the peasant brothers while they were working. All this, in the past, we only felt a little from newspapers or submissions, but now it is all vividly in front of us. Seeing this enthusiasm, we feel deeply ashamed. The earth-shattering heroic spirit of the working people is really not reflected enough in our literature and art.

    In order to better enable the publication to take root in the heated mass struggle, and to truly achieve a state where the editorial staff and the peasant brothers are united in thought and life, the editorial department, under the instructions of the commune Party committee, is now vigorously assisting the cultural centers (stations) of various townships and teams, as well as the backbone of mass creation, to establish or improve mass creation groups.

    In terms of lifestyle, we have put forward the slogan of "militarization." In addition to conducting twenty minutes of military training every morning after getting up, we also set aside half of the personnel every day to participate in half a day of agricultural labor. At the same time, we are preparing to actively participate in various political movements of the commune, such as crash literacy campaigns, eliminating the four pests, National Day propaganda, and "four modernizations" debates. Through these activities, we will truly integrate the editorial staff with the peasant masses, learn the excellent qualities of the peasant brothers, and at the same time bring culture and literature deep into the countryside.

    All comrades of our editorial department strive to be trained into literary workers who can both wield the pen to edit publications and pick up the hoe to engage in physical labor in the short term, and we will never let down the hopes of the Party and all the broad masses of young authors and young readers who care about "Budding Sprouts."

    到火热斗争中去扎根“萌芽”
    杂志编辑部
    9月21日，我们“萌芽”编辑部的全体人员，在党的关怀与指引下，背起了铺盖行装，搬进了上海郊区第一个人民公社——“七一”人民公社。
    虽然我们下来还不过一个星期的时间，但是农民兄弟们那种冲天的生产干劲，使我们受到了一次深刻的共产主义教育。当我们路过七宝镇（公社办公所在地）时，我们就看到有一百多个青年“卫星”营的指战员们，在将近一人深的“壕沟”里深翻土地，准备在明年放出小麦丰产“卫星”来，他们提出了要“夺全国冠军，创世界纪录”的豪迈口号；在我们住所的周围，从清晨到深夜，都能听到农民兄弟在劳动时的谈笑声。这一切，过去我们只是从报纸上或来稿中感受到一些，现在都历历在目了。看到这种干劲，使我们感到深深的惭愧，劳动人民这种惊天动地的英雄气慨，在我们文学艺术上，实在是反映得太不够了。
    为了更好的使刊物在火热的群众斗争中扎下根来，并真正做到编辑人员同农民兄弟在思想上、生活上打成一片，目前编辑部在公社党委的指示下，正大力着手协助各乡各队的文化馆（站）及群众创作中的骨干，建立或健全群众创作组。
    在生活上，我们提出了“军事化”的口号，除了每天一清早起床后，进行二十分钟的军事操练外，还每天抽出一半的人员，参加半天的农业劳动，同时准备积极参加公社的各项政治运动，如突击扫盲、除四害、国庆宣传以及“四化”辩论会等，通过这些活动，使编辑人员真正同农民群众打成一片，学习农民兄弟的优秀品质，同时把文化和文学深入到农村去。
    我们编辑部全体同志争取在短期内，一定锻炼成为既能拿笔杆编刊物的文学工作者，也能拿起锄头进行体力劳动的一个劳动人民，决不辜负党和所有关心“萌芽”的广大的青年作者和青年读者的希望。
