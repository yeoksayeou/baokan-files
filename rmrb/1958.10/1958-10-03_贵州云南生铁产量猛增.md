Guizhou and Yunnan See Sharp Increases in Pig Iron Production

(Our report) Guizhou Province's various ethnic groups launched an all-out offensive on pig iron production on September 29th, causing pig iron production to rise sharply. On this day, the province produced a total of 2,067 tons of pig iron, an increase of about one-third compared to the previous day. Encouraged by the slogan of launching satellites to offer gifts for National Day, Zunyi, Renhuai, and Zheng'an counties increased their daily output from below 100 tons to over 200 tons, becoming several red flags on Guizhou's pig iron production front.

This achievement was obtained under conditions of full preparation. Starting on the 27th, the province mobilized more than 3.1 million laborers to go to the front lines of mining, coal digging, and transportation. After organizing more than one million people, the Zunyi Special District adopted the method of large-scale collaboration, dividing the entire special district into four fronts, and uniformly allocating labor for mining and transportation.

Entering the 29th, an intense iron smelting battle began throughout the province. In many mountain villages, blazing fires shone, and smoke billowed. Carts and wheelbarrows transporting "grain and wages" for the indigenous blast furnaces traveled endlessly on the roads of various mountain villages. In order to launch satellites, the furnaces carried out red flag competitions with each other. In the competition in Jinsha County, thirteen indigenous blast furnaces launched satellites with a daily output of two tons. Renhuai County, the home of Maotai liquor, whose daily output had never exceeded 100 tons, produced 120 tons of pig iron from zero o'clock to twelve noon on this day, setting a new record for the county's pig iron production.

(Our report) The million-strong army on the iron and steel front in Yunnan Province fought with all their strength, presenting National Day with a 28.5% increase in daily pig iron production on September 29th, reaching 1,402 tons. By September 29th, Yunnan Province had produced more than 76,000 tons of iron this year.

In order to strive to complete the iron and steel production plan for September, all counties in Yunnan Province conducted emergency mobilizations on the 28th. In Qujing Special District, in addition to the county party secretary personally taking charge, five to six county party leaders went to the iron and steel front. The daily output has reached more than 550 tons, and Luoping County, the second county in the province with a daily output of 100 tons, has emerged. The pig iron output in Lijiang Special District on the 29th doubled compared to the 28th.

    贵州云南生铁产量猛增
    本报讯　贵州省各族人民在9月29日向生铁生产发起了一个总进攻，使生铁生产猛力上升。在这一天中，全省共生产了生铁二千零六十七吨，比头一天增加三分之一左右。遵义、仁怀、正安等三个县在放出卫星向国庆献礼的口号鼓舞下，日产量由原来一百吨以下提高到二百吨以上，成为目前贵州生铁生产战线上的几面红旗。
    这个成绩是在充分准备的条件下获得的。27日起，全省动员了三百一十多万劳动大军走上了采矿、挖煤和运输等战线。遵义专区组织起一百多万人马后，采取大协作的办法，把全专区分为四条战线，统一调配劳力进行采矿和运输。
    进入29日，全省一个紧张的炼铁战斗开始了。在许多山村里都闪耀着熊熊烈火，青烟缭绕，为土高炉运“粮饷”的牛马车和人力车，在各个山村大道上络绎不绝。各高炉为了放出卫星，炉与炉之间开展了红旗竞赛。金沙县在竞赛中，有十三座土高炉放出了日产两吨的卫星。原来日产量一直没有超过一百吨的茅台酒之乡——仁怀县，在这天的零点起到中午十二时止，就生产生铁一百二十吨，创造了全县生铁生产最高纪录。
    本报讯　云南省钢铁战线上百万大军全力奋战，9月29日以生铁日产量提高28.5％达到一千四百零二吨的成绩向国庆节献礼。到9月29日，今年云南省已经生产铁七万六千多吨。
    为了力争完成9月份钢铁生产计划，云南全省各县都在28日进行了紧急动员，曲靖专区除仍由县委书记亲自挂帅外，每县都有五至六个县委负责干部亲上钢铁前线，日产量已达五百五十多吨，出现了全省第二个日产百吨县——罗平县。丽江专区29日的生铁产量，比28日提高了一倍。
