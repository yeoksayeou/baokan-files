    Determined to Dedicate Everything to the People of All Nationalities in Ningxia
    Meng Qinglin, Chief Geological Engineer of the Wuzhong Exploration Brigade
    I am a petroleum geologist working at the Wuzhong Exploration Brigade of the Yinchuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau. This time, I was elected as a representative to the first People's Congress of the Autonomous Region by the Hui and Han people of Ningxia.
    When I started working in 1950, I was just a student fresh out of school. At that time, I knew nothing about practical work except for a little theoretical knowledge from books. Over the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, my political understanding has greatly improved. Therefore, when I was working in Jintaigou in Ordos, I discovered a petroleum area with very large reserves. This is an extremely promising oil layer with a large oil-bearing area and many oil seeps, comparable to Karamay. This has extremely important political and economic significance for the various production and construction projects in the Ningxia area. But this great achievement can only be achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the united efforts of all ethnic groups. In the future, I will further boost my revolutionary drive, continue to transform my thinking, and dedicate everything I have to the Party and to the people of all nationalities in the Ningxia region!

    决心把一切献给宁夏各族人民
    吴忠勘探大队主任地质工程师　孟庆麟
    我是一个石油地质工作者，在银川石油勘探处关忠勘探大队工作。这次，被宁夏回汉人民选为自治区第一届人民代表大会的代表。
    我在1950年参加工作时，还是一个刚刚出学校的学生。那时，除了知道一点书本上的理论知识外，对于实际工作知识一点也不懂。几年来，在党的培养教育下，使我在政治上得到了很大提高，因此，在鄂尔多斯斤垢台工作的时候，发现了一个蕴藏量很大的石油地区。这是一个极有希望的石油层，储油面积很大，油苗很多，可以和克拉玛依相比。这对宁夏地区的各项生产建设，有极其重大的政治意义和经济意义。但这只有在中国共产党的领导下和各族人民的团结努力下，才能取得这样伟大的成绩。今后，我要进一步鼓起革命干劲，继续改造自己的思想，把我的一切献给党，献给宁夏地区的各族人民！
