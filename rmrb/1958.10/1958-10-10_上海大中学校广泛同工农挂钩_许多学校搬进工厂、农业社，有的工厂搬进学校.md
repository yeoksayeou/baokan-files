Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th October: Shanghai's universities and colleges, in implementing work-study programs, have widely "linked up" with factories, enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives, based on Shanghai's characteristics of concentrated factories and comprehensive industries. In addition to running some factories themselves, this has enabled more than 400,000 university and middle school students in the city to participate in production labor in a short period. Up to now, according to incomplete statistics, 21 universities and more than 200 middle schools in the city have been linked with 4,378 factories, enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives. With the establishment of the People's Communes, the content of the links is also changing. After a period of linking up, some schools and factories/agricultural cooperatives have seen schools move into factories/agricultural cooperatives, or factories move into schools. Their slogan is: "Link up first, then merge families." This is a new trend in the development of Shanghai's educational undertakings.

When Shanghai's universities and colleges and factories/agricultural cooperatives began to link up, the general approach was for both parties to establish fixed contacts, with teachers and students regularly going in batches to participate in production and perform general labor. Some school teachers and students, while working in factories and rural areas, helped factories, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives set up spare-time schools. Factories, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives were responsible for teaching the participating teachers and students to reach a certain technical level within a certain period. However, these general linking methods can no longer meet the requirements of the developing situation. Later, the Physics Department of Fudan University moved the Yangxingji Machine Factory, which it was linked with, into the school. One hundred and fifty teachers and students from the Shanghai Theatre Academy moved to the "July 1st" People's Commune to settle down. More schools will be moving into factories and agricultural cooperatives. Since the start of the new semester, teachers and students from Shanghai's universities have gone to factories, rural areas, enterprises, and institutions in entire departments and batches, taking up posts in production labor. All universities have included participation in production labor at linked units as a formal course, with the time spent on labor generally being three months, and the longest being half a year. Some schools will establish a half-work (farming) half-study system through linking up.

Teachers and students from Shanghai's universities and colleges have also assisted linked units in establishing more than 1,600 various types of spare-time schools, and have helped agricultural cooperatives establish many biogas stations, small blast furnaces, tidal power stations, and granular fertilizer plants, and have planted many experimental fields for various crops. Many schools have also used their own equipment and technical strength to accept a large number of production, design, and new product trial manufacturing tasks from linked units.

    上海大中学校广泛同工农挂钩
    许多学校搬进工厂、农业社，有的工厂搬进学校
    据新华社上海9日电　上海市大中学校在实行勤工俭学中，根据上海市工厂集中、行业俱全的特点，除自办部分工厂外，广泛同工厂、企业及农业生产合作社“挂钩”，使全市四十多万大中学生在短期内都参加了生产劳动。到目前止，据不完全统计，全市二十一所高等学校和二百所中等学校已和四千三百七十八个工厂、企业、农业社和手工业社挂了钩。随着人民公社的建立，挂钩的内容也在起变化，有些学校同工厂、农业社经过一个时期的挂钩之后，学校搬进了工厂、农业社；有的工厂搬进了学校。他们的口号是：“先挂钩，后并家”。这是上海学校教育事业发展的新趋势。
    上海的大中学校和工厂、农业社开始挂钩时，普遍的方式是双方建立固定的联系，师生定期分批前去参加生产，进行一般劳动；有些学校师生在下厂下乡劳动的同时，帮助工厂、企业和农业社创办业余学校；工厂、企业、农业社则负责教会前来参加劳动的师生在一定时期内达到一定的技术水平。但是这些一般性的挂钩方式，已不能适应形势发展的要求。后来，复旦大学物理系把挂钩的杨兴记机器厂搬到学校里来。上海戏剧学院师生一百五十人搬到了“七一”人民公社去安家“落户”。还将有更多的学校搬到工厂和农业社里去。新学年开始以后，上海各高等学校的师生更整系成批的开赴工厂、农村和企业、事业单位，走上生产劳动的岗位。各高等学校已经把到挂钩单位参加生产劳动列入正式课程，每年参加劳动的时间一般是三个月，最长的是半年。有些学校将通过挂钩，建立半工（耕）半读制度。
    上海市大中学校的师生，还协助挂钩单位创办了一千六百多所各种类型的业余学校，帮助农业社建立了许多座沼气站、小高炉、潮水发电站、颗粒肥料厂，种了许多种农作物的试验田。许多学校并利用自己的设备和技术力量，接受了挂钩单位大量的生产、设计和试制新产品的任务。
