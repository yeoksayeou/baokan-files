Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: Approximately 250,000 American auto workers began a large-scale strike on October 2nd, demanding higher wages and improved benefits. The strike has already forced the capitalists to accept most of the workers' demands.

These auto workers belong to the United Automobile Workers union. This union recently held negotiations with the three major American auto companies—General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford—regarding the signing of new collective agreements, and put forward demands for improving workers' treatment. After prolonged delays, Ford and Chrysler were recently forced to change their original stubborn attitude, agree to accept some of the workers' demands, and sign new collective agreements with the union. However, General Motors, the largest of the three, attempted to resist to the end, refusing to improve the lives of auto workers.

The attitude of the General Motors bosses enraged the workers. Starting on the 2nd, approximately 250,000 auto workers at 126 factories in 71 cities in the United States, downed their tools and held the largest strike in the United States so far this year. This strike brought production to a standstill at General Motors, the so-called largest manufacturing conglomerate in the capitalist world.

Approximately twelve hours into the strike, the General Motors capitalists helplessly accepted the workers' proposal, agreeing to increase workers' hourly wages by 24 to 30 cents and sign a three-year collective agreement with the union. However, due to unresolved disputes between some local unions and the capitalists, the strike of 250,000 auto workers continued on the 3rd.

At the same time, 25,000 workers belonging to the International Union of Electrical Workers also went on strike at six General Motors plants. 12,400 workers at ten Chrysler plants and 1,550 workers at a Ford plant in Chicago also held spontaneous strikes.

The strike by American auto workers marks a new surge in the struggle of American workers to win their own rights. It is reported that newspaper printing workers in Washington and ship employees on the east coast of the United States also went on strike on the 2nd. The strike by newspaper printing workers completely halted the publication of newspapers in the American capital on the 2nd, while the strike by ship employees almost paralyzed passenger and freight transportation at ports along the east coast of the United States from Boston to New Orleans.

    反对资方残酷剥削　争取改善生活条件
    美国二十五万汽车工人大罢工
    资本家不得不接受工人大部分要求
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国约二十五万汽车工人从2日开始举行大罢工，要求提高工资和改善福利待遇。罢工已经使资方不得不接受工人提出的大部分要求。
    这些汽车工人是属于联合汽车工人工会的。这个工会最近曾经分别同美国三大汽车公司——通用汽车公司、克莱斯勒汽车公司和福特汽车公司举行关于签订新的集体合同的谈判，在谈判中提出了改善工人待遇的要求。福特汽车公司和克莱斯勒汽车公司在经过长期的拖延后在不久前已不得不改变原来的顽固态度，同意接受工人的一些要求，同工会签订了新的集体合同。但是势力最大的通用汽车公司却企图顽抗到底，拒绝改善汽车工人的生活。
    通用汽车公司老板的态度激怒了工人。从2日起，通用汽车公司在美国七十一个城市的一百二十六家工厂的约二十五万汽车工人放下了工具，举行今年以来美国最大的一次罢工。这个罢工使通用汽车公司这个所谓资本主义世界最大的制造业联合企业的生产陷于停顿。
    在罢工约十二小时后，通用汽车公司资方无可奈何地接受了工人的建议，同意把工人每小时工资提高二角四分到三角美元，并且同工会签订了为期三年的集体合同。但是由于一些地方工会和资方的纠纷还没有解决，二十五万汽车工人的罢工在3日还在继续进行中。
    与此同时，属于国际电气工人工会的二万五千名工人也在通用汽车公司的六家工厂举行罢工。克莱斯勒汽车公司十家工厂一万二千四百名工人和福特汽车公司芝加哥厂的一千五百五十名工人也举行了自发罢工。
    美国汽车工人的罢工标志着美国工人争取切身权利的斗争的新高涨。据报道，在2日举行罢工的还有华盛顿的报纸印刷工人和美国东海岸的轮船职工。报纸印刷工人的罢工使美国首都的报纸在2日完全停版，而轮船职工的罢工使美国东海岸从波士顿到新奥尔良一带各港口的轮船客运和货运工作差不多全部陷于瘫痪。（附图片）
