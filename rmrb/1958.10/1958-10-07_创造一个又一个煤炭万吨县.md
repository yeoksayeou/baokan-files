Creating One Ten-Thousand-Ton Coal County After Another
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

A red flag for high coal production is flying over Baofeng County, Henan Province. The county's daily coal production was originally only 70 tons. After five days of hard work by the people of the whole county, 435 new and restored small coal kilns were built, jumping to more than 5,100 tons, and then rising sharply to more than 30,000 tons. This is indeed a miracle. The emergence of this miracle marks another great victory for the Party's mass line and points out a way to rapidly increase coal production to meet the needs of the iron and steel industry.

The method of "small, indigenous, and mass" to strive for high-speed development of coal production has been proven by many facts. However, in coal mining enterprises, this method is not understood and recognized by all comrades. Some people, although having good intentions to develop small coal kilns, lack a viewpoint of proceeding from actual conditions and move the complete sets of large-scale, formal "foreign methods" to small coal kilns. As a result, the "foreign methods" cannot be implemented, and the "indigenous methods" also fail. The road of Baofeng County is a road of "indigenous methods first." They use livestock, manpower, or utilize natural terrain (such as slopes) as power. During the mining process, when groundwater prevents work, they dig drainage tunnels to concentrate the water and use cowhide bags, canvas bags, or bamboo tubes to lift the water up. In short, they fully utilize the Party's mass line, relying on the "indigenous experts" and "indigenous engineers" among the masses, to come up with many "indigenous methods" and create a large number of "indigenous tools." Therefore, in a short period of days, they achieved the blooming of small coal kilns throughout the county.

Taking indigenous methods as the main approach, developing small coal kilns as the main focus, and mobilizing and organizing the power of the broad masses to form a high tide of all the people running mines, it seems that this is the only way to adapt to the current great development of the iron and steel industry. Of course, we do not deny that on the basis of "popularization," we must further improve; that is to say, after thousands of small coal kilns have been developed, we must also use practical "foreign methods" and various good methods of our own to gradually carry out technical transformation of these small coal kilns. Improve on the basis of popularization, popularize under the guidance of improvement, indigenous first and then foreign, from small to large, so that coal production can develop rapidly and continuously.

Some comrades are still doubting: Can small coal kilns solve big problems? Can they meet the needs? Some comrades even believe that opening small coal kilns can only be regarded as a "sideline" and not as a "main business." We believe that "big" and "small" are not absolute; we should not detach ourselves from specific conditions and actual situations and one-sidedly conclude that "small coal kilns cannot solve big problems." The output of a small coal kiln is indeed negligible, but the output of thousands of small coal kilns is an astonishing figure. Baofeng's daily output has now reached 30,441 tons, which is equivalent to about eighteen large mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons. To build such a pair of mines, the state needs to invest about 10 million yuan, allocate a large amount of steel, cement, and modern machinery and equipment, and it takes two years to complete. However, Baofeng did not spend a single penny of state investment, and in just a few days, the output has doubled and doubled again, rising in a straight line. Of course, we must admit the backbone role of large mines in the development of the coal industry, but we cannot therefore exclude the role of small coal kilns, or even regard them as "sidelines." Now, the whole Party and the whole people are fighting iron and steel, with small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces scattered all over the country. If we only rely on a few relatively concentrated large coal mines, we cannot guarantee the supply of coking coal to the dispersed, large number of indigenous and small blast furnaces. That is to say, in addition to building a certain number of large mines, we must rely on the special districts, counties, townships, and communes to develop small coal kilns in large quantities. Using small coal kilns blooming everywhere to meet the needs of coking coal for the scattered indigenous and small blast furnaces, so that the small and indigenous blast furnaces can obtain coal locally as much as possible, which can not only guarantee the needs, but also save transportation capacity and reduce the cost of ironmaking.

At present, the iron and steel front has launched the "Huai-Hai Campaign," and thousands upon thousands of small and indigenous blast furnaces need the soldiers on the coal industry front to supply a large amount of coking coal. We hope that all localities will earnestly grasp the work of developing small coal kilns. We believe that after Baofeng County wins the high-yield red flag, more ten-thousand-ton counties will emerge across the country.

    创造一个又一个煤炭万吨县
    本报评论员
    在河南宝丰县的上空飘扬着一面煤炭高产红旗。这个县的煤炭日产量原来只七十吨，全县人民苦战五天，新建和恢复小煤窑四百三十五个，一跃而为五千一百多吨，接着又急剧上升到三万多吨。这确是一个奇迹。这个奇迹的出现，标志了党的群众路线又一次的伟大胜利，并且指出了迅速提高煤炭产量，满足钢铁工业需要的一条门径。
    用“小、土、群”的办法争取高速度发展煤炭生产，这已经被许多事实证明了的。但是，在煤矿企业中，这个办法并不是为所有的同志了解和承认的。有些人虽然也有发展小煤窑的良好的愿望，但是，由于缺乏从实际情况出发的观点，把成套大套的，正规的“洋办法”搬到小煤窑去，结果，“洋法”上不了马，“土法”也落了空。宝丰县的道路是一条“土法先上马”的道路，他们没有动力，就用牲口，人力或利用自然地形（如倾斜）作动力，在开采过程中，遇到地下水不能工作时，就开泄水洞，把水集中起来，用牛皮包、帆布包或竹筒把水提升上来。总之，他们充分运用了党的群众路线，依靠群众中的“土专家”“土工程师”，想出了许多“土办法”，创造了大量的“土工具”。因此，他们在短短的几天之内，做到小煤窑在全县开了花。
    以土法为主，以发展小煤窑为主，把广大群众的力量动员和组织起来，形成全民办矿的高潮，看来，这是适应当前钢铁工业大发展的必由之路。当然，我们并不否认在“普及”的基础上，还必须进一步提高；也就是说，千万个小煤窑发展起来以后，我们还要用切合实际的“洋办法”和我们土生土长的各种好办法，逐步地对这些小煤窑进行技术改造。在普及的基础上提高，在提高指导下普及，先土后洋，从小到大，煤炭生产就可以迅速地不断向前发展。
    还有的同志在怀疑着：小煤窑能不能解决大问题？能不能满足需要？甚至有的同志认为：开小煤窑只能作为“副业”，不能算是“正业”。我们认为，“大”和“小”不是绝对的；我们不应该脱离具体条件和实际情况，片面地断定“小煤窑不能解决大问题”。一个小煤窑的产量，的确微乎其微，可是聚集了千万个小煤窑的产量，就是一个惊人的数字。宝丰的日产量现在已经达到三万零四百四十一吨，这就约相当于十八个年产六十万吨的大型矿井。建设一对这样的矿井，需要国家投资一千万元左右，需要国家拨给大量的钢材、水泥和现代化的机械设备，需用二年的时间才能建成。但是，宝丰没有花国家一文投资，在短短几天内，就使产量翻上加翻，直线上升。当然，我们必须承认大型矿井在煤炭工业发展中的骨干作用，但是不能因此而排斥小煤窑的作用，甚至把它视为“副业”。现在，全党、全民正在大战钢铁，小高炉，土高炉星罗棋布，遍及全国，如果只靠几个比较集中的大型煤矿，根本不能保证供应分散的、大量的土高炉和小高炉对炼焦煤的需要。也就是说，我们除了建设一定数量的大型矿井以外，必须依靠专、县、乡、社大量开发小煤窑。以遍地开花的小煤窑来满足星罗棋布的土高炉、小高炉对炼焦煤的需要，使小高炉和土高炉尽可能作到就地取煤，这样不仅可以保证需要，而且可以节省运输力，降低炼铁的成本。
    目前钢铁战线已展开“淮海大战”，千千万万的小高炉，土高炉，需要煤炭工业战线上的战士们供给大量的炼焦煤。我们希望各地把发展小煤窑的工作切实地抓起来。我们相信，继宝丰县夺得高产红旗之后，全国将会出现更多的万吨县。
