    福建高产周超过计划指标
    据新华社福州24日电　福建省第一个钢铁高产周中，钢铁生产并驾齐升，成就巨大。
    在这一周内，铁平均日产二千二百九十九点七吨，超过计划指标近一点三倍；钢平均日产三百九十吨，超过计划指标95％。21日——高产周的最后一天，全省产铁六千七百六十六吨，产钢八百零八吨，是全省全党全民大办钢铁以来产量最高的一天。目前，全省正在信心百倍地加紧备料、建炉、练兵，准备迎接第二个战役。
    在这次高产周中，全省开上钢铁战线的劳动大军达三百多万人，投入生产的大小炼铁炉共五万二千多座。海防前线的厦门市人民，除了担负着紧张的支前任务外，也组织了五万人的钢铁大军，日夜奋战。驻在厦门的前线部队，在执行任务的空隙中拣了一百八十四吨炮弹片和废铁，支援钢铁生产；许多部队都帮助当地炼钢、运输、挖煤、采矿。他们在海防斗争中是勇士，在钢铁战线上又是健将。
