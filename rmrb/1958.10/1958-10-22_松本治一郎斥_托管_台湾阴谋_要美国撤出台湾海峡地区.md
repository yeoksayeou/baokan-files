Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th - Jiichiro Matsumoto, head of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation visiting China, said to reporters in Hong Kong on his way back to his country: The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, therefore, the best way to solve the Taiwan issue is for the Chinese people to conduct peaceful negotiations themselves. He believes that Defense Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots proposing "Of the thirty-six stratagems, reconciliation is the best" is the best option for Chiang Kai-shek.

Matsumoto Jiichiro also refuted the idea of using "trusteeship" to solve the Taiwan issue, saying, "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and it is impossible to put Taiwan under trusteeship." He reiterated that the United States military should immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. He said, "No one in the world now believes that Taiwan is U.S. territory." Regarding the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States to conclude a "Japan-U.S. Joint Defense Treaty" and a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance," Matsumoto Jiichiro pointed out that the Japanese people are absolutely opposed to this conspiracy.

    松本治一郎斥“托管”台湾阴谋
    要美国撤出台湾海峡地区
    新华社香港20日电　日中友好协会访华代表团团长松本治一郎返国途中路经香港时，对香港的记者说：台湾问题是中国的内政问题，因此，让中国人自己进行和平谈判是解决台湾问题的最好办法。他认为：彭德怀国防部长在告台湾同胞书中所提出的“三十六计，和为上计”，对于蒋介石来说，是最好不过的事情。
    松本治一郎还驳斥妄想用“托管”的办法来解决台湾问题的说法，他说：“台湾是中国领土，要想托管台湾是不可能的”。他重申了美国军队应该立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡的主张。他说：“现在世界上没有一个人会认为台湾是美国的领土。”在谈到岸信介政府与美国正在策划缔结“日美共同防卫条约”和“东北亚军事同盟”的阴谋时，松本治一郎指出：日本人民是绝对反对这种阴谋的。
