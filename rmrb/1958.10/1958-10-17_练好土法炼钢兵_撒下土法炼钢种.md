    Train Well the Indigenous Steelmaking Troops
    Sow the Seeds of Indigenous Steelmaking
    The Shangcheng On-Site Conference’s Immediately Effective Experience is Widely Disseminated
    Hundreds of Thousands of Indigenous Furnaces Will Be Built, With a Daily Output Reaching 200,000 Tons
    The Great Superiority of Indigenous Steelmaking:
    Furnaces Can Be Built and Steel Produced on the Same Day
    Steelmaking Skills Can Be Learned in Two Days
    Xinhua News Agency, Shangcheng, 16th – The six-day National Indigenous Steelmaking Shangcheng On-Site Conference closed today.

    Before the conference closed, delegations from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country reported to the conference the significant gains they had made at this meeting and expressed their firm confidence in promoting indigenous steelmaking. They also presented banners to express their high respect to the heroic people of Shangcheng County, Henan Province.
    Furnaces can be built and steel produced on the same day, and a complete novice can basically master the skills of furnace building and steelmaking in one or two days. This is the great superiority of indigenous steelmaking, unanimously affirmed by representatives from all over the country after on-site visits and practical operations. Therefore, representatives from all regions are confidently preparing to return and immediately promote this good, immediately effective method. According to preliminary figures presented at the meeting by representatives from only eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Gansu, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Fujian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, they will immediately build 150,000 Shangcheng-style and Zhengzhou-style indigenous steelmaking furnaces after returning. Adding this number to the existing indigenous steel furnaces in various regions, there will be at least 200,000 or more indigenous steelmaking furnaces nationwide this year. Once all these furnaces are put into production, they can produce approximately 200,000 tons of steel per day and night.
    On the last day of the conference, Xia Yun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, gave a summary. He said that this was the first on-site conference centered on indigenous steelmaking held nationwide. Its convening marks that under the leadership of the Party, China's iron and steel industry is about to be pushed to a new climax, a new great leap forward situation will emerge, thereby greatly promoting China's socialist industrialization.
    Xia Yun then summarized the gains of this meeting from the "abstract" and "concrete" aspects. He said that in the abstract aspect, the meeting achieved the purpose of three breaks and three establishments: break the emphasis on foreign over indigenous, establish the combination of indigenous and foreign; break the expert route, establish the mass line; break right-leaning conservatism, establish the communist style. Through abstract discussion, those who originally believed in the small indigenous groups policy are now more determined; those who had reservations or doubts have now changed; those who did not have a clear understanding are now more clear.
    In the concrete aspect, the meeting achieved the purpose of extensively exchanging advanced experiences in indigenous steelmaking. In addition to focusing on the exchange of Shangcheng and Zhengzhou's indigenous steelmaking experience, the meeting also discovered more than a dozen types of indigenous steelmaking furnaces in Sichuan, Shanxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Gansu provinces. The indigenous steelmaking experiences of these places were also exchanged at the conference. The conference also organized all representatives to conduct on-site practical operations on more than fifty pairs of Shangcheng-style low-temperature steelmaking furnaces and two types of indigenous reverberatory steelmaking furnaces, thus enabling most of the representatives to learn a set of indigenous steelmaking skills, cultivating a group of backbone forces for vigorously promoting indigenous steelmaking experience in various regions. The conference also held an exhibition introducing the development of the iron and steel industry in Shangcheng County, displaying more than 600 products made of indigenous steel, including various machinery and tools for agricultural production and industrial production. In addition, during the conference, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Shangcheng County jointly organized a testing station to conduct chemical analysis, metallographic observation, and physical performance tests on indigenous steel, proving that the indigenous steel produced by Shangcheng and Zhengzhou's indigenous steelmaking furnaces fully meets the standards of low-carbon steel. This series of activities not only enabled everyone to learn the skills of indigenous steelmaking and increase their technical knowledge, but also strengthened everyone's confidence in developing indigenous steelmaking.

    练好土法炼钢兵
    撒下土法炼钢种
    商城现场会议立竿见影经验广传
    将建土炉几十万日产可达廿万吨
    土法炼钢巨大优越性：
    当天建炉当天可以出钢
    两天就能学会炼钢本领
    新华社商城16日电　为期六天的全国土法炼钢商城现场会议，已在今天闭幕。
    在会议闭幕前夕，来自全国二十七个省、市、自治区的代表团，都向大会报告了在这次会议上得到的巨大收获，表示了对推广土法炼钢的坚定信心；他们并且赠献锦旗，向英雄的河南省商城县人民表示崇高的敬意。
    当天建炉当天可以出钢，而且一个完全外行的人一两天之内就能基本上掌握建炉和炼钢的本领。这是来自全国各地代表在进行现场参观和实际操作以后，一致肯定的土法炼钢的巨大优越性。因此各地代表都满怀信心地准备回去马上推广这种立竿见影的好办法。会上仅据江苏、山西、江西、甘肃、安徽、湖南、四川、陕西、福建、吉林、黑龙江等十一个省的代表提出来的初步数字统计，他们回去以后就将立即建设十五万个商城式和郑州式土法炼钢炉。这个数字再加上各地原有的土钢炉，全国今年至少能出现二十万个以上的土法炼钢炉。这些炉子全部投入生产以后，每昼夜可以产钢二十万吨左右。
    大会最后的一天，冶金工业部副部长夏耘作了总结。他说，在全国范围内召开以土法炼钢为中心的现场会议，这是第一次。它的召开，标志着我国钢铁工业在党的领导下即将推向一个新的高潮，出现一个新的大跃进局面，从而大大地促进我国社会主义的工业化。
    夏耘接着从“虚”“实”两个方面总结了这次会议的收获。他说，在虚的方面，会议达到了三破三立的目的：破重洋轻土，立土洋并举；破专家路线，立群众路线；破右倾保守，立共产主义风格。通过务虚，原来相信小土群方针的人，现在更加坚定了；原来有保留或怀疑的人，现在转变了；原来认识不清楚的人，现在更加明确了。
    在实的方面，会议达到了广泛地交流土法炼钢先进经验的目的。会议除着重交流了商城和郑州的土法炼钢经验外，同时还发现了四川、山西、湖南、贵州、甘肃等省也有十多种土法炼钢炉。这些地方的土法炼钢经验，也在大会上进行了交流。会议还组织全体代表，在五十多对商城式低温炼钢炉和两种土法反射炼钢炉上进行了现场实际操作，因而使绝大部分的代表学会了一套土法炼钢的本领，为各地大力推广土法炼钢经验培养了一批骨干力量。会议还举办了一个展览会，介绍了商城县发展钢铁工业的概况，陈列了用土钢制造的六百多种产品，其中包括农业生产和工业生产的各种机械和工具。此外，在开会期间，冶金工业部和商城县还共同组织化验站，对土钢进行了化学分析、金相观察和物理性能试验，证明商城、郑州土法炼钢炉所产的土钢，完全合乎低炭钢的标准。这一系列的活动，不仅使大家学会了土法炼钢的本领，增长了技术知识，而且更加坚定了大家发展土法炼钢的信心。（附图片）
