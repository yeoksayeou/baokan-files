Master Gao Righteously Raises an Infant

Yang Zhonghai, a worker at the Baiquan County Flour Mill, suffered the loss of his wife due to excessive bleeding during childbirth. Already burdened with the care of two children without their mother, what would he do with this newborn baby? Many people in the factory were worried about Old Yang.

This news reached Gao Dechi, a worker in the power workshop and a Communist Party member, who felt deeply saddened by Old Yang's misfortune. He thought, "With three children to care for, won't this affect Old Yang's work?" He thought of his own wife. If she could raise the child, and Old Yang could take his two older children to the factory cafeteria for meals, the problem would be solved. He happily went to discuss it with Old Yang, but hesitated at the doorstep. He thought about his own four children, the oldest just nine years old and the youngest not yet weaned. Because of this, he and his wife had been practicing contraception for two years. Cooking and feeding the pigs kept his wife busy enough. Could she really handle raising a newborn baby? Suddenly, an image flashed before his eyes. It was the image of his friend, an old worker named Lao Zhao. Before liberation, Lao Zhao had been fired from the factory due to illness and eventually died in poverty. Before his death, Lao Zhao held his hand and told him that workers all over the world are one family, and only through unity and struggle can they survive. Now, in the midst of the Great Leap Forward, workers are enthusiastically engaging in technological revolution, and he absolutely couldn't let Old Yang fall behind because of family affairs. So he went to see the secretary of the factory's Party branch. The secretary patted him on the shoulder and said, "That's a great idea! Let's do it. The organization will help with any difficulties." This made Master Gao smile with satisfaction.

As soon as he got off work, Master Gao went to Northwest Street to find Yang Zhonghai without even eating dinner. Old Yang was anxiously waiting. Master Gao comforted him and then picked up the little baby, saying, "Old Yang, let me take this child!" "No, I can't..." Master Gao said, "Give it to your sister-in-law to raise, and when he grows up, we'll give him back to you." "Your sister-in-law has so many children, how can she manage?" "Don't say that, saving a life is the most important thing!" Without another word, Master Gao picked up the child and left. When he got home, his wife greeted him and said, "Where did you pick up a baby in the middle of the night?" Master Gao explained the situation, and his wife quickly took the child and said, "Give him to me, be careful he doesn't catch a cold." She gently placed the child on the bed, opened the cabinet, and took out a small shirt to change the baby into.

This incident moved Yang Zhonghai to tears, and Master Gao also breathed a sigh of relief and smiled happily.

    高师傅仗义养婴儿
    拜泉县制粉厂工人杨忠海的妻子，因难产流血过多死了。两个孩子没娘照料已够苦恼了，再加上这个刚出生的娃娃，怎么办呢？厂里许多人都为老杨犯愁。
    这个消息，被动力车间工人、共产党员高德池听到了，他为老杨的不幸，感到痛心。他想：老杨三个孩子都需要照料，这不影响工作吗？他想到自己的老婆，如果她能抚养这个小孩，叫老杨自己带上两个大孩子到厂里食堂吃饭，问题就解决了。他高高兴兴地去找老杨商议，可是一踏进门坎，又退回来了。他想到自己已有四个孩子，大的刚九岁，小的还没断奶。为了这，夫妻俩两年前就实行避孕了。做饭喂猪，够妻子忙的了，再抚养一个刚出生的娃娃，行吗？突然，一个影子掠过他的眼前。这是他的朋友、一个工人老赵的影子。解放前，他因生病被厂里解雇，最后贫病而死。临死前，老赵握着他的手，告诉他，天下工人是一家，只有团结斗争才能生活。如今，在大跃进中，工人们都在热火朝天地搞技术革命，绝不能瞅着老杨因家务事牵累而掉队。于是他去找厂党支部书记。书记拍拍他的肩膀说：“你这一招想得好！就这么办吧，有困难组织帮助。”说得高师傅满意地笑了。
    一下班，高师傅没顾得上吃饭，就到西北街去找杨忠海。老杨正在焦急。高师傅劝了劝他，就一把抱起小娃娃说：“老杨，这小孩给我吧！”“不，不能……”高师傅说：“交给你大嫂抚养，长大了还给你。”“大嫂那么多孩子怎么能成啊？”“别说那些，救命要紧！”高师傅二话没说，抱起小孩就走。回到家里，他的妻子迎上来说：“大黑夜的，打那拣来个娃娃？”高师傅说明原由，高大嫂忙上前夺过小孩说：“快给我，看风灌着。”她把小孩轻轻放到炕上，打开柜子，取出来一件小衫给孩子换上了。
    这件事，使杨忠海感动得流出了泪，高师傅也松了口气，高兴得笑了。黑龙江省拜泉县畜牧局　高　富（附图片）
