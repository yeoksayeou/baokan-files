Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th: Reporter Ping Lan reports: Chairman Mao instructed at the end of March this year while on the Jiangxia steamer on the Sichuan River that navigation marks should be electrified. This ideal has been realized by the waterway workers of the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration after arduous efforts. At present, eighteen kilometers of the Sichuan River waterway from Chongqing to Wanxian has been electrified, and the electrification of the entire Sichuan River navigation marks can be achieved next year.

    The original navigation marks on the Sichuan River waterway, with the exception of a few shore lights, were all oil lamps lit manually. The Sichuan River has many shoals, is narrow, and has rapid currents, making it very inconvenient for people to light the lamps. During floods, night navigation is often affected because the lights cannot be lit. After the navigation marks are electrified, there is no need for people to watch and light the lamps. Instead, the speed of the water flow is used to drive a generator to supply power to the navigation mark lights. The problem of electrifying the navigation marks was first studied in 1954, and a series of experiments were carried out, but two key problems were not solved. One problem was that the water flow speed varied greatly, and the generator speed could not be stabilized, so the light was flickering and did not meet navigation standards. The other problem was that small generators were easier to maintain when using alternating current, but the original automatic bulb replacement equipment could not be used with alternating current. There was only one bulb, and if it burned out, there was no replacement. After the Rectification Campaign, especially after Chairman Mao's instructions, the thinking of the workers was greatly liberated. Under the specific assistance of the Party Committee of the Sichuan River Waterway Management Office of the Chongqing Branch, they overcame conservative and self-deprecating ideas, repeatedly studied and experimented, and successively solved these two key problems.

    The first electrified navigation marks to appear on the Sichuan River is a major reform in the management of inland river waterways in our country. Recently, ships coming upstream from Hankou and Wanxian at night can see a series of particularly bright floating buoy lights from afar when approaching Chongqing Port. The workers painted these lights especially beautifully. They said excitedly: "We must decorate it well so that Chairman Mao can see it next time he passes the Sichuan River."

### 川江出现电气化航标

    川江出现电气化航标
    据新华社重庆6日电　记者平兰报道：毛主席今年3月底在川江江峡轮上指示航标应该走向电气化，这个理想已经被长江航运管理局重庆分局的航道职工经过艰苦努力实现了。目前，川江航道重庆到万县段十八公里已实现航标电气化，明年就可以实现川江全线航标电气化。
    川江航道上原有的航标，除少数岸灯外，都是用人工点的油灯。川江滩多、狭窄、水流湍急，人点灯很不方便。洪水期间，常常因不能点灯而影响夜航。航标电气化后，就不用人看管和点灯了，而是利用水流速度带动发电机供给航标灯的电源。航标电气化的问题，在1954年就曾经着手研究，并进行了一系列的试验，但有两个关键问题没有解决。一个问题是水流速度快慢变化很大，发电机的转速不能稳定，电灯光忽明忽暗，不合航行标准；另一个问题是小型发电机以采用交流电较易维护，但原有自动换泡设备不能在交流电源上使用，灯泡只有一个，烧坏了没有替换的。经过整风运动，特别是毛主席的指示以后，职工们思想大大解放。他们在重庆分局川江航道管理处党委具体帮助下，打掉保守、自卑思想，反复研究、试验，先后解决了这两个关键问题。
    川江首先出现电气化航标，这是我国内河航道管理工作上的一个重大改革。最近，从汉口、万县上水夜航来的船只，在快到重庆港的时候，远远地就可以看到一座一座分外明亮的水上浮标灯。职工们把这些灯标漆得特别漂亮，他们兴奋地说：“一定要把它打扮得好一些，让毛主席下次再过川江时看看。”
