    Picture Books Should Also Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past
    Ma Nan

    Picture books – this type of spiritual food, published in large quantities, with wide distribution, covering the most content, and read by men, women, the old, and the young, its compilation, printing, publication, promotion, and distribution are all worth serious consideration.

    I once investigated a grassroots scientific experiment institution. This institution is composed of workers, intellectual cadres, and workers’ families and children, each accounting for one-third; in the institution's library, in addition to general literature, political, and business books and magazines, picture books account for a considerable number, about two thousand copies. Judging from the borrowing situation, not many people borrow other books and magazines, but many people borrow picture books, it can be said that the whole institution has one copy, several copies, or dozens of copies per person; some people have even read all of them. Some people don't even read books and newspapers, just picture books.

    Let's see what kind of picture books are here:

    The Complete Set of the Chu-Han Contention;
    Most of the Fairy Tales;
    Movie comic books account for an equal number;
    A part of the Stories of the Volunteers;
    Very few stories about workers and peasants turning over to carry out revolution, the Great Production, and the Great Leap Forward.

    In short, in these picture books, we still can't see or rarely see our socialist construction, our Great Leap Forward for all the people. Moreover, the content itself shows the editor's ideological tendency to emphasize the past and de-emphasize the present.

    It is necessary to give people, especially children, some historical knowledge, but after reading the historical stories narrated in picture books, one can only know that such a thing happened. What exactly did these historical stories and characters do, what position did they occupy in history, how to understand them, and how to analyze them is rarely done. Therefore, I hope that the publishers and editors of picture books will consider this issue in their editing ideas – to give people, especially children, a little correct materialist dialectical historical knowledge, I think this can be done and should be done.

    The second is fairy tales. We are not against giving people, especially children, picture books of this kind of subject matter, but I always feel that the quantity should not be too large. These fairy tales certainly also praise labor and sympathize with the laboring people, but most of them pin the solution of difficulties on gods or treasures, instead of relying on the masses to struggle themselves, especially the description of some laboring people who, because of their bravery, gained the love of princesses and kings, and later became kings themselves, and then took their property to help the poor. In ancient times, this certainly had its positive significance, but it would blur their class consciousness to use it extensively to popularize education for today's people and children.

    There are few picture books reflecting modern life, especially those reflecting the current Great Leap Forward. This should be said to be a matter of the guiding principles for compiling and printing picture books, as well as a matter of standpoints and viewpoints. I think it should be reversed immediately, change the past bias in picture books of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, and let picture books also raise the red flag of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past. I hope this will attract the attention of publishing institutions.

### 小人书也要厚今薄古

    小人书也要厚今薄古
    马楠
    小人书——这个出版数量大，销路广，内容方面涉及最多，而且又是男女老幼都看的精神食粮，它的编印、出版、推广、发行，都是值得慎重考虑的。
    我曾调查过一个基层科学试验机关，这个机关是工人，知识分子干部，和工人家属、小孩各占三分之一；这个机关的图书馆中，除一般文艺、政治、业务书刊杂志外，小人书占了相当数量，约有两千册左右。从借阅的情况看，别的书报杂志借阅的人并不那么多，但小人书则借阅的人很多，可以说是全机关人手一册、数册、或数十册；也有的人全部看了的。甚至有的人连书报都不看，光看小人书。
    看看这里是些什么样的小人书吧：
    楚汉相争全套；
    神话故事大部分；
    电影连环画占相等数量；
    志愿军的故事一部分；
    工农翻身闹革命，大生产、大跃进的很少。
    总之，从这些小人书中还看不到或者很少看到我们的社会主义建设，我们的全民大跃进。而且就是这些内容本身，也表现了编辑者的厚古薄今的思想倾向。
    给人们、给儿童一些历史知识是必要的，但小人书所叙述的历史故事，读后只能是知道有这么回事，究竟这些历史故事、人物到底干了些什么，他们在历史上占个什么地位，怎样来认识他们，分析他们，做的就很少。因此，就希望小人书的出版编辑者在编辑思想上考虑到这个问题——要给人们，尤其是给孩子们一点正确的唯物辩证法的历史知识，我想这是可以做到和应该做到的。
    其次是神话故事。我们不反对给人们，尤其是给孩子们看这类题材的小人书，但我总感到数量不可以太多。这些神话故事当然也有表扬劳动和同情劳动人民的，但其中大多数是把解决困难寄托于神仙或宝物，而不是依靠群众自己奋斗，尤其是描写一些劳动人民由于勇敢，得到了公主和国王的喜爱，自己后来也当了国王，转而把财产拿来救济贫民。这在远古时代，当然也有它的积极意义，但把它大量拿来通俗化地教育今天的人民和孩子，是会模糊他们的阶级意识的。
    反映现代生活的小人书少，特别是反映当前大跃进的太少，这应该说是编印小人书的方针问题，也是立场观点问题。我以为应该立即扭转过来，改变过去小人书中厚古薄今的偏向，让小人书也插上厚今薄古的红旗。这一点希望能引起出版机关的注意。
