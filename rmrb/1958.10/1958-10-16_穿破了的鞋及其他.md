Worn-Out Shoes and Other Things

    Worn-Out Shoes
    Some say that more work means more pay, and that piece-rate wages stimulate production. To be honest, piece-rate wages stimulate "more pay," not "more work"; personal interests, not collective interests. Emphasizing more work for more pay makes it difficult for people to put politics in command, and instead encourages selfishness. Some people even devote themselves wholeheartedly to the pursuit of RMB, their eyes blinded by money. How can we talk about building socialism then? As people's communist ideology becomes more universally elevated, piece-rate wages are like worn-out shoes, and it's time to change to a new pair.
                                    (Cheng Quan, Worker in Beijing)
    Communist Ideology Installs Quickly
    After work, everyone is reluctant to take off their work clothes, unwilling to leave the workshop, and they are all doing voluntary labor. The group leader jokingly said, "It's off work, if you don't leave you can get overtime pay!" We said: "You mention overtime pay again, we don't care about that stuff. It feels good to work a little more from the bottom of our hearts. Asking the people for compensation, is that what a worker should do!" In the years of the Great Leap Forward, our minds have really opened up, communist ideology installs quickly, and has already crushed the 'individualistic ghost ideology.'"
                (Jiang Shutian, Zhao Qinghua, Workers at Beijing Daily Printing Plant)
    Piece-Rate Wage System is Outdated
    The piece-rate wage system once played a certain role. Now, after the rectification movement, people's political consciousness has greatly improved, and piece-rate or not piece-rate doesn't make much of a difference anymore. Take our factory as an example, since the cancellation of the piece-rate wage system, production value has increased again and again. In order to complete the task, many people eat and live in the factory, not going home for days on end. I ask, in the years when the piece-rate wage system was implemented, did anything like this ever happen?

    When the piece-rate wage system was implemented, some people would ask "Did you lose or gain money?" as soon as they met. Some people would often argue with the quota setter about working hours, and some people would only pick the easy jobs to do. Some people only cared about doing their own work quickly, regardless of the next process. Normal communication between some types of work was also cut off. Don't you think the piece-rate wage system should be abolished?
                  (Li Shengyi, Worker at Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory)
    Difficulties, Solutions, Experience
    Increasing production inevitably has difficulties, and where there are difficulties, there are definitely solutions, and where there are solutions, there is experience.
　(Workers of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant)
    Walking
    People who always walk in other people's footsteps will always fall behind others. They won't walk fast, and they won't find new paths.
                            (Ma Xiliang, Xi'an Second Brick and Tile Factory)
    Four "Do"s
    We do the work that others are unwilling to do; we do the work that others can't reach the quota for; we do the most difficult work; we are there to work whenever the leadership needs us.
                          (Li Huanbo Group, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company)
    Swinging
    Giving play to subjective initiative is like swinging. For a proponent of conditions, he will stand motionless facing the swing and shout: "Without the help of external forces, how can I swing?" For someone who dares to think and dare to do, he will step onto the swing board without hesitation. Although it may be difficult for him to swing at the beginning, he will always swing higher and higher, and it will become easier and easier. (Huang Yan, Lujiaoge Township, Zunhua, Hebei)

    穿破了的鞋及其他
    穿破了的鞋
    有人说，多劳多得，计件工资刺激生产。说句良心话：计件工资刺激的是“多得”，而不是“多劳”；是个人利益，而不是集体利益。强调多劳多得，就使人很不容易政治挂帅，反而会助长自私自利。有些人甚至一心一意只为人民币奋斗，眼睛都被钞票糊住了。哪还说得上建设社会主义呢？在人们的共产主义思想普遍提高以后，计件工资好像穿破了的鞋，该换一双了。
                                    （北京工人　程泉）
    共产主义思想装得快
    下班了，大伙全不乐意脱掉工服，舍不得走出车间，都在义务劳动。小组长打趣地说，下班了，不走可开加班费啦！我们说：又提加班费，俺们不稀罕那玩艺，多干一点活打心眼里痛快，手心朝人民要报酬，这不是工人的本份！在大跃进的年月，脑袋可真开窍了，共产主义思想装得快，早把“个人主义鬼思想”给挤碎了。
                （北京日报印刷厂工人　姜书田　赵清华）
    计件工资制过时了
    计件工资制曾经起了一定的作用。现在经过整风运动，人们的政治觉悟已经大大的提高，计件不计件已经起不了什么作用了。拿我们厂来说，自取消计件工资制度后，生产产值加了一番又一番，为了完成任务，有很多人在厂里吃、厂里住，一连几天不回家。试问在实行计件工资制的几年里，哪一年出过这样的事。
    实行计件工资制的时候，个别的人一见面就问“赔没赔，赚多少”，有人还常为工时跟定额员争吵，有人还光拣好干的活做。有些人只顾自己快着干，不管下一工序。有些工种之间的正常来往也切断了。你说计件工资制还不该取消吗？
                  （长辛店机车车辆修理厂工人　李生义）
    困难、办法、经验
    要增产难免有困难，有困难也一定有办法，有办法就有了经验。
　（上海钢铁公司一厂工人）
    走路
    老是踩着别人脚印走路的人，一定永远落在别人的后面。他走不快，也走不出新路。
                            （西安市第二砖瓦厂　马希良）
    四干
    别人不愿干的活我们去干；别人达不到定额的活我们去干；最困难的活我们去干；领导上什么时候需要我们就什么时候干。
                          （武汉钢铁公司　厉焕波小组）
    打秋千
    发挥主观能动性有如打秋千。对于条件论者，他一动也不动地对着秋千叫嚷说：“没有外力的帮助，我怎么摆得动啊！”对于敢想敢干的人，他会毫不犹豫地踏上秋千板。尽管开始时他摆起来很困难，但他总会越摆越高，而且越摆越容易。（河北遵化鹿角河乡　黄彦）
