Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" today published a commentary on the US imperialists' instruction to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force to use missiles, saying that if the American "Sidewinder" continues to threaten China, then the Chinese people will have no choice but to pin this snake to the ground and dig out its fangs. The article pointed out that the provocateurs are risking their own heads.

The article stated that this type of missile has never been used in history, including during World War II and the Korean War. The United States supplying F-86F aircraft and Sidewinder missiles to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang constitutes a new and shameless provocation against the Chinese people, exposing their bloodthirsty faces to the world, and making the situation in the Taiwan area even more tense.

The article emphasized that China is not alone in its just struggle. The Soviet government has twice warned that not only the United States, but also the other side, possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons and delivery vehicles. If an atomic attack is launched against China, the aggressor will immediately be retaliated against with the same weapons. China has issued twenty serious warnings to the American aggressors; ignoring these warnings would be reckless.

The "Soviet Russia" newspaper pointed out in an article that it would be ridiculous to think that China does not have modern weapons. The article emphasized that although the missiles were fired from planes bearing the markings of the Chiang gang, this is merely a formality; both the planes and the missiles are American-made. The United States has today participated in military action against the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: TASS, Moscow: The "New Times" magazine published an article in its fortieth issue commenting on the Sino-US Warsaw talks, saying that world opinion has placed great hopes on these talks, but it can be seen from foreign newspaper comments that Washington's position is hindering the success of the talks, as it has put forward demands that China cannot accept at all. This refers to the so-called "ceasefire" and "non-use of force."

The article continued, the US ruling clique came to the Warsaw talks with strategic goals in mind. Their provocative activities in the Taiwan Strait region have aroused widespread indignation and unease at home and abroad. Washington agreed to the Warsaw talks primarily to portray itself as a champion of peaceful settlement of disputes, in order to get rid of its isolated predicament.

The article pointed out that, on the other hand, the United States came to the talks intending to use them as a smokescreen, attempting to expand its aggression with less difficulty under the cover of this smokescreen, and to legalize the occupation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

The article said that proposing "ceasefire" and "non-use of force" is precisely to achieve this goal.

### 苏联报刊斥美国挑衅者拿自己脑袋冒险  中国有现代化武器还击原子狂人

    苏联报刊斥美国挑衅者拿自己脑袋冒险
    中国有现代化武器还击原子狂人
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联“红星报”今天在一篇评论美帝国主义指使蒋贼空军使用导弹的文章中说，如果美国的“响尾蛇”继续威胁中国，那么中国人民只好把这条蛇压在地上，把它的毒牙挖出来。文章指出，挑衅者是在拿自己的脑袋来冒险。
    文章说，这种导弹在历史上还从来没有被利用过，包括第二次世界大战和朝鲜战争时期。美国把F—86F型飞机和响尾蛇导弹供给蒋介石匪帮，这就造成了美国对中国人民的一种新的无耻挑衅。向全世界暴露了他们的嗜血面目。台湾地区局势更紧张了。
    文章强调说，中国在正义的斗争中不是孤独的。苏联政府已经两次警告说，不仅美国，而且其他一方也拥有原子和氢武器和载运工具。如果对中国发动原子进攻，那么侵略者立刻会遭到同样武器的还击。中国已对美国侵略者作了二十次严重警告，忽视这些警告将是轻率的。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”在一篇文章中指出，如果认为似乎中国没有现代化的武器，那将是非常可笑的。文章强调指出，尽管导弹是从涂有蒋帮标志的飞机上发出的，但是这不过是形式而已，飞机和导弹都是美国制造的。美国今天已经参加了反对中国人民的军事行动。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“新时代”杂志第四十期发表一篇评中美华沙谈判的文章说，世界舆论对这个谈判寄予很大希望，但是从外国报纸评论中可以看出，华盛顿的立场妨碍谈判取得成功，它提出了中国完全不能接受的要求。这里指的是所谓“停火”和“不使用武力”。
    文章接着写道，美国统治集团是抱着战略目的来到华沙谈判的。他们在台湾海峡地区的挑衅活动在国内外引起了普遍的愤慨和不安。华盛顿之所以同意华沙谈判首先是为了把自己打扮成和平解决争端的维护者的角色，以便摆脱孤立的窘境。
    文章指出，另一方面，美国前来谈判是打算利用谈判作为幌子，企图在这个幌子的掩护下以较小的困难扩大侵略，使侵占台湾和澎湖列岛合法化。
    文章说，提出“停火”和“不使用武力”的建议就是为了达到这个目的。
