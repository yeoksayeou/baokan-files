Seize the Production of Large Machine Tools

	Following the rapid advancement of the steel industry, China's machinery industry, especially the foundational machinery industry, is about to experience a major development upsurge. To vigorously develop the foundational machinery industry for manufacturing metallurgical rolling equipment, mining equipment, power generation equipment, and transportation equipment, the current problem is the urgent need for a large amount of technical equipment, especially large machine tools for manufacturing these heavy machinery.

	However, the foundation of China's large machine tool manufacturing industry is weak, its capacity is insufficient, and the number of factories specializing in the production of large machine tools is still small. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, built with Soviet assistance, has only recently been put into production. Some regions have already built many factory buildings, but due to the lack of machine tool equipment, the investment effect cannot be quickly realized. According to preliminary estimates, the large machine tools produced nationwide this year can only meet about half of the demand; next year, production needs to increase five or six times compared to this year to meet the demand.

	Therefore, developing large machine tools has become a prominent link in the current development of the machinery industry. Failure to quickly seize the development of large machine tools will hinder the rapid increase in metallurgical, power station, and transportation capacity, thereby affecting the high-speed development of the entire industry.

	Currently, there are two attitudes towards the development of large machine tools in the machinery industry departments. One is to wait for allocation, emphasize conditions, and believe that manufacturing large machine tools involves large castings, large equipment, and complex structures, and these three difficulties are difficult to overcome, so they dare not start. The other attitude is to mobilize the masses, combine indigenous and foreign methods, and vigorously carry out technological revolution, with everyone participating in self-manufacturing large machine tools. Obviously, the former are conservatives, and the latter are revolutionaries.

	The broad masses of workers in the machinery industry departments want to be revolutionaries. Many factories have already broken the superstition of designing and manufacturing large machine tools and have successfully manufactured large machine tools using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. Summarizing the experience of these factories, it can be said that the main direction for accelerating the development of large machine tools has been found.

	The first experience is that each factory manufactures simple large machine tools themselves to equip themselves and expand production capacity. Experience has shown that as long as superstitions are broken and the masses are mobilized, not only large machinery factories can manufacture them, but also general small and medium-sized factories can manufacture them. From the simple large machine tools that have been manufactured, their characteristics and advantages are simple structure, convenient manufacturing, adaptation to local conditions, and clear purpose of process requirements. More importantly, the time is short, the cost is low, and the results are quick.

	Some people will say that this is not "formal," and simple large machine tools are not efficient and do not have a long service life. We believe that emphasizing "formal" restricts the enthusiasm of the masses. What's wrong with being informal but able to solve the problem? Moreover, simple large machine tools are often manufactured according to the processing requirements of the factory, most of which are highly specialized and not necessarily less efficient. Even if some are not very efficient, it is better than nothing. As for the short service life of simple large machine tools, what does it matter if they are updated after a few years? The most important thing is that by doing this, we gain time and strive for speed.

	It is conceivable that if it is not a few factories or a dozen factories, but hundreds of factories manufacturing large machine tools, then the output of large machine tools can definitely increase several times.

	The second experience is to mobilize the masses to carry out product revolution. Currently, most of the large machine tools produced in China are general-purpose products, lacking several modified or specialized products that are tailored to the specific processing requirements of users. As a result, the components of many products are not needed by some specific users. This not only causes waste for users but also unnecessarily consumes the production capacity of the manufacturing plant. On the other hand, the structure of many products is too complex or retains some unreasonable structures. Therefore, there is often great potential to be tapped here. For example, the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant improved the structure of the large gear hobbing machine. Under the condition that the processing performance remained completely unchanged, the total weight of the machine tool was reduced from 90 tons to 50 tons compared with the same type of machine tool abroad.

	Although there is great potential in the design of large machine tools, this potential cannot be tapped if the superstition of product design is not broken. There are still many people who believe that product design is only the business of a few designers, and the working masses do not understand design. In fact, this idea is completely wrong. We know that any product, including large machine tools, has two masters: one is the user, and the other is the manufacturer. I ask you, where would product design come from without the needs of the user and the various experiences accumulated by the manufacturer? Of course, we do not deny the role of designers. But if this role is exaggerated, and it is even believed that product design can only be monopolized by a few designers, then the path of the mass line in the machinery industry is blocked.

	The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant extensively mobilized the masses, with everyone working together to "treat the diseases" of the products, breaking the superstition of product design, making the workers the masters of the products, simplifying the product structure, eliminating some of the product's defects, and at the same time developing a series of modified products adapted to the different requirements of various users, thereby also expanding their production capacity by nearly one-third. The hydraulic control box of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant was improved in design by the workers, reducing the number of parts from 17 to 11, which not only reduced manufacturing man-hours and saved materials compared to the original design, but also had higher performance than the original design. These vivid examples are a good education for those who think that only a few technicians can engage in product design.

	The third experience is the use of reinforced concrete components in large machine tools. This is a new initiative in technological revolution, which has a major revolutionary significance for the development of large machine tools.

	First of all, it overcomes the difficulty of insufficient steel materials. Casting capacity lagging behind processing is a key issue that is common in various machinery factories; and the severe shortage of large castings is a weak link in the rapid increase in the demand for large machine tools. The widespread use of reinforced concrete to manufacture large components of large machine tools solves this prominent contradiction. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant has already achieved successful experience in this regard, which makes it possible for the output of large machine tools to increase several times next year compared to this year.

	Secondly, it also breaks the mysterious view of manufacturing large machine tools, and further creates conditions for the widespread blooming of large machine tools. When manufacturing large machine tools, the biggest problem that people generally feel is large castings. When they hear that it weighs dozens of tons, many people are daunted and emphasize the conditions. The use of reinforced concrete to manufacture large components of large machine tools can not be completely restricted by large equipment conditions. Moreover, it can be prefabricated and is not completely restricted by large factory conditions. In this way, the superstition of those who only believe in conditions can be broken, and everyone's confidence in manufacturing large machine tools can be further encouraged.

	In addition, it also has the advantages of short manufacturing cycle and low cost. Generally speaking, the manufacturing cycle can be shortened by half and the cost can be reduced by more than 30% by using reinforced concrete to make large components on large machine tools than using cast iron parts. This also plays a big role in expanding the output of large machine tools.

	The direction for accelerating the development of large machine tools has been found. The current problem is that while the local party committees are focusing on steel, they should immediately put the work of seizing large machine tools on the agenda; they must rely on the masses to conscientiously lead the technological revolution of the machine tool industry, and especially use the fastest speed to develop large machine tools as soon as possible. Only in this way can we guarantee the great leap forward in the steel and machinery industries.

    抓紧生产大型机床
    紧随着钢铁工业的飞速前进，我国的机械工业，特别是基础性的机械工业，即将要出现一个大的发展高潮。而要大力发展制造冶金轧钢设备、矿山设备、发电设备、交通运输设备等基础性机械工业，当前面临的问题是迫切地需要大量的技术装备，特别是制造这些重型机械的大型机床。
    但是，我国大型机床制造工业的基础很弱，能力不足，专业生产大型机床的厂，为数还很少，苏联帮助我国建设的武汉重型机床厂才投入生产不久。现在有些地区已盖好了不少厂房，但由于缺乏机床装备，不能迅速发挥投资效果。据初步估计，今年全国生产的大型机床，只能满足需要的一半左右；明年更要比今年增长五、六倍，才能满足需要。
    因此，发展大型机床已成为当前发展机械工业的一个突出环节，不迅速抓紧发展大型机床，就将阻碍冶金、电站及交通运输能力的迅速上升，从而将影响到整个工业的高速度发展。
    现在在机械工业部门中对待大型机床的发展有两种态度。一种是坐等分配，强调条件，认为，制造大机床要大铸件、大设备、结构复杂，这三个困难都难于克服，因而不敢动手去搞。另一种态度是发动群众，土洋并举，大闹技术革命，大家动手自制大机床。显然，前者是保守派，后者是革命派。
    机械工业部门的广大职工是要做革命派的。现在已经有很多工厂打破了设计和制造大机床的迷信，用土洋并举的办法成功地制造出了大机床。综合这些工厂的经验，可以说加速大机床的发展，已经找到了主要的方向。
    第一个经验是：各厂自己动手，制造简易的大机床来装备自己，扩大生产能力。经验证明，只要打破迷信，发动群众，不仅大机械厂可以制造，而且一般中小厂也可以制造。从已经制造出的简易大机床来看，其特点和优越性是结构简单，制造方便，因地制宜，工艺要求的目的性明确。更重要的是时间短，花钱少，收效快。
    有些人会说这样搞不“正规”，简易大机床效率不高，使用寿命不长。我们认为，强调“正规”，就束缚了群众的积极性。不正规而能解决问题，有什么不好呢？而且，简易大机床往往是针对本厂加工要求制造的，大多数专用性强，效率并不见得低。即使有一部分效率不很高，也总比没有好。至于说简易大机床使用寿命不长，那么用过几年后再更新又有什么关系呢？最重要的是这样做了，我们就赢得了时间，争得了速度。
    可以设想，如果不是几个工厂或十几个工厂，而是几百个工厂在制造大型机床，那么，大机床的产量肯定能够几倍地向上增长。
    第二个经验是：发动群众，进行产品革命。目前我国生产的大型机床，多为万能性产品，缺乏针对用户具体加工要求的若干变型的或专用的产品。这样，有许多产品的部件对一些特定的用户来说，并不是需要的。这不仅给用户造成浪费，而且不必要地消耗了制造厂的生产能力。另一方面，有不少产品的结构过于复杂，或保留着一些不合理的结构。因此，在这里面往往有很大的潜力可挖。例如，重庆机床厂改进了大滚齿机的结构，在加工性能完全不变的条件下，和国外同类型的机床比较，机床总重量由九十吨降低到了五十吨。
    虽然大型机床的设计中有很大的潜力，但是如果不打破对产品设计的迷信，这些潜力是挖不出来的。现在还有不少人认为产品设计只是少数设计人员的事，工人群众是不懂得设计的。事实上，这种想法完全是错误的。我们知道，任何产品，包括大机床在内，它的主人有两个，一个是使用者，另一个是制造者。试问离开了使用者的需要，离开了制造者积累的各种经验，哪里还有什么产品设计呢？当然，我们并不否认设计人员的作用。但是如果夸大了这种作用，甚至认为产品设计只能由少数设计人员包办，那就堵塞了机械工业走群众路线的道路。
    沈阳第一机床厂广泛发动群众，大家动手，给产品“治病”，就打破了对产品设计的迷信，使工人做产品的主人，精简产品结构，消除了一些产品的缺陷，同时发展了一系列适应各种用户不同要求的变型产品，从而也使自己的生产能力扩大了近三分之一。上海机床厂的液压操纵箱，经工人改进设计，零件由十七个减少到十一个，不仅比原设计减少了制造工时，节约了材料，而且性能还比原设计高。这些生动的例子对于那些认为只有少数技术人员才能搞产品设计的人，是个很好的教育。
    第三个经验是：在大型机床上采用钢筋混凝土构件。这是技术革命中的一个新创举，它对大型机床的发展有着重大的革命意义。
    首先，它克服了钢铁材料不足的困难。铸造能力落后于加工，是目前各机械厂普遍存在的一个关键问题；而大铸件严重不足更是大型机床要求急速增产的一个薄弱环节。广泛地采用钢筋混凝土来制造大机床的大构件，就解决了这个突出的矛盾。武汉重型机床厂在这方面已经取得了成功的经验，这样就有可能使明年大型机床的产量比今年增长几倍。
    其次，它还打破了制造大机床的神秘观点，为大机床遍地开花进一步地创造了条件。制造大机床，一般人感到问题最大的是大铸件，一听到它有几十吨重一个，很多人就望而生畏，强调起条件来了。而采用钢筋混凝土来制造大机床的大构件，则可以不完全受大的设备条件的限制。而且它还可以预制，又不完全受大的厂房条件的限制。这样，就可以打破唯条件论者的迷信，进一步鼓舞大家动手制造大机床的信心。
    另外，它还有制造周期短，成本低的优点。一般的说，采用钢筋混凝土比采用铸铁件做大机床上的大构件，制造周期可以缩短一半，成本可以降低30％以上。这对扩大大机床的产量也是有很大作用的。
    加速发展大型机床的方向有了。现在的问题是，各地党委在抓钢铁的同时，应该马上把抓大型机床的工作也摆到日程上来；要依靠群众，认真地领导机床工业的技术革命，特别是要尽先地用最快的速度，来发展大型机床。只有这样，才能够保证钢铁和机械工业大踏步地改进。
