The Expansion of American Monopoly Capital in Southeast Asia
Le Shan

"A Striking Change"

American monopoly organizations have traditionally focused their capital exports on countries in the Western Hemisphere. However, in recent years, in terms of the growth rate of American foreign direct investment, investment in Asian countries has jumped to the top. Using capital exports as the main means, American monopoly organizations have launched a frantic campaign in Southeast Asia and other parts of Asia to seize markets, expand the scope of exploitation, plunder cheap labor, seize cheap raw material producing areas, and pursue maximum profits. In March 1958, Mildred Hughes, Executive Vice President of the Far East American Council of Commerce and Industry, said at the New York Exporters' Annual Meeting that "a striking change" had taken place in American private investment in Asia. According to the figures listed by Hughes, in 1950, American direct investment in Asia (excluding various other agreements or reinvestment of companies abroad) was $284 million, and in 1956, this figure increased to $784 million. Of this, $353 million was directly invested in petroleum, $127 million in manufacturing, $87 million in trade, $71 million in public utilities, and the remainder in other investments.

	Octopus Tentacles

American monopoly capital, like the tentacles of an octopus, penetrates all parts of the Southeast Asian region. In the Philippines, from 1940 to 1956, American private investment totaled approximately $90 million, increasing to $460 million. The power of American monopoly capital groups occupies a strong position in the Philippine processing industry, mining industry, foreign trade, and other economic sectors. American capital accounts for 40% of sugar production in the Philippines, 80% of palm oil production, and more than half of the mining of gold, chromium, manganese, and iron ore. The companies affiliated with American Rockefeller, Morgan, DuPont, and other large financial groups have strong influence in the Philippines. Through these enterprises, American monopoly capital organizations have extracted huge profits.

In Malaya, American rubber companies occupy huge territories. Here, as in Australia and New Zealand, the American Ford Motor Company has branches. American monopolists are currently planning to further plunder the tin mining industry in Malaya.

American oil companies control most of the oil fields currently being exploited in Indonesia. According to a report in the Indonesian "Star of the East" on August 31, the American DuPont and Rockefeller monopoly capital groups are desperately trying to obtain the right to exploit new oil fields in northern and southern Sumatra. The Indonesian "People's Daily" stated on February 7, 1957, that due to the increase in investment by Mobil Oil, American capital in Indonesia had increased to approximately $350 million, exceeding British capital, which had previously ranked second.

The Thai semi-monthly magazine "Economic" reported in its first issue of 1957 that the American "Bank of America" had opened a branch in Thailand. Mobil Oil and Texaco Oil have actual investments in Thailand amounting to no less than $10 million. The United States has fifteen wholesale trading firms in Thailand, one insurance company, and various companies jointly operated with Thais, such as four large soft drink companies. American Pan American World Airways and other enterprises have also made direct investments in Thailand. It is estimated that American direct investment in Thailand is more than $16 million.

American monopoly organizations are increasingly accelerating the seizure of raw material producing areas in South Vietnam. New York Mobil Oil built the largest office building in Saigon and has 175 agencies throughout South Vietnam. New companies such as American Asia Insurance Company and Pepsi-Cola Company have been established. The United States and Ngo Dinh Diem are planning to add enterprises such as refrigerator assembly plants and Ford automobile assembly plants.

According to news revealed by the Burmese "Nation" in July of this year, American monopoly capital is actively attempting to enter the Burmese oil exploration industry. American monopolists are "very interested" in Burma. In Pakistan, American Chase Bank and Irving Trust Company Bank have already opened for business. American New York Mobil Oil and Mobil Oil have obtained the privilege of exploring and operating the Balochistan oil fields. The American-Pakistan Oil Company was also founded in 1954.

The penetration of American monopoly capital in Southeast Asia has reached an all-pervasive degree.

	Trying Every Possible Way to Seize Profits

American monopoly capital groups attempt to enslave the Southeast Asian region, oppose the independent economic development of Southeast Asian countries, and attempt to make Southeast Asia a sales market for American industrial products and a raw material producing area.

When several American steel trusts—United States Steel Corporation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and Republic Steel Corporation—were commissioned by the Pakistani government to investigate the possibility of developing the metallurgical industry in Pakistan, they stubbornly insisted that Pakistan had no such possibility and suggested that Pakistan import steel from abroad.

Mobil Oil in Thailand even questioned the Thai authorities because Thailand planned to build an oil refinery, demanding that Thailand abandon its plan to establish its own oil industry.

In South Vietnam under the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet regime, American consumer goods are rampant. South Vietnam is forced to import approximately 150 million meters of various fabrics from the United States each year, while local needs in South Vietnam are only 100 million meters. More than 10,520 of South Vietnam's more than 15,000 textile machines have been forced to shut down.

In addition to direct investment, American monopoly capital organizations also use so-called "US aid" as a way to export capital. "US aid" has damaged agricultural production in Southeast Asian countries. For example, the United States forcibly sells its stockpiled "surplus" agricultural products through "US aid," resulting in Burma and Thailand losing their past rice sales markets in Japan, India, and other places.

American monopoly capital organizations use direct investment to establish their own industrial enterprises, transportation companies, port buildings, stacks, warehouses, farms, and plantations in Southeast Asia. American monopoly organizations obtain huge profits through their companies, branches, and companies jointly operated by American capital and local enterprises or merchants. American monopoly capital organizations also use a portion of the profits they seize as new investments to achieve the goal of "small investment, big return." The following chart, compiled based on statistics from the American "Modern Commercial Overview," can serve as an example of how American monopoly capital makes money:

The all-pervasive penetration of American monopoly capital in Southeast Asia, the enslavement, exploitation, and profit seizure carried out by American monopolists in Southeast Asia, fully proves the truth pointed out by Lenin in "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism":

"The old capitalism, which was dominated by free competition, was characterized by the export of commodities. Modern capitalism, which is dominated by monopolies, is characterized by the export of capital." (Image attached)

    美国垄断资本对东南亚的扩张
    乐山
      “引人注目的变化”
    美国垄断组织的资本输出向来以西半球国家为主要对象。但是，最近几年以来，就美国国外直接投资增长的速度而言，美国对亚洲国家的投资一跃而居首位。美国垄断组织以资本输出为主要手段，在东南亚与亚洲其他地区展开了夺取市场、扩大剥削范围、掠夺廉价劳动力、侵夺廉价的原料产地、追逐最高利润的疯狂活动。1958年3月，美国远东工商业理事会执行副主席米耳德里德·休斯在纽约出口商年会上说，美国在亚洲的私人投资发生了“引人注目的变化”。根据休斯所列举的数字，1950年美国对亚洲的直接投资（不包括各种其他协议或公司在国外的再投资）为二亿八千四百万美元，1956年，这个数字增为七亿八千四百万美元。其中三亿五千三百万美元直接投资于石油，一亿二千七百万美元投资于制造业，八千七百万美元投入贸易，七千一百万美元投入公用事业，余为他项投资。
          章鱼的触须
    美国垄断资本像章鱼的触须一样，渗透在东南亚地区各地。在菲律宾，从1940年到1956年，美国的私人投资总额约从九千万美元增至四亿六千万美元。美国垄断资本集团的势力在菲律宾的加工工业、采矿工业、对外贸易以及其他经济部门中占有强大的地位。美国资本在菲律宾蔗糖生产中占40％，在棕榈油生产中占80％，在金、铬、锰、铁矿的开采中占一半以上。美国洛克菲勒、摩根、杜邦等大财团所属的公司在菲律宾势力雄厚。通过这些企业，美国垄断资本组织吸取了巨大的利润。
    在马来亚，美国橡胶公司占据了巨大的地盘。在这里，也像在澳大利亚和新西兰一样，美国的福特汽车公司设有分公司。美国垄断资本家目前还正在策划进一步掠取马来亚的锡矿业。
    美国的石油公司控制了印度尼西亚现在开采的大部分油田。据印度尼西亚“东星报”8月31日透露，美国杜邦和洛克菲勒垄断资本集团正在拚命设法取得苏门答腊北部和南部的新油田的开采权。印度尼西亚“人民日报”1957年2月7日称，由于美孚油公司投资的增加，在印度尼西亚的美国资本约增为三亿五千万美元，超过了过去占第二位的英国资本。
    泰国“经济”半月刊1957年第一期报道，美国的“美洲银行”在泰国开设了分行。美孚油公司与德士古石油公司在泰国的实际投资额不下于一千万美元。美国在泰国有十五家批发商行，一家保险公司，还有与泰国人合办的各种公司，如四个大型汽水公司。美国泛美世界航空公司与一些别的企业也对泰国进行了直接投资。估计美国在泰国的直接投资额在一千六百万美元以上。
    美国垄断组织日益加速地攫取了南越的原料产地。纽约美孚油公司在西贡修建了一座当地最大的办公大楼，又在南越各地设有一百七十五个代办处。一些新的公司如美亚保险公司、柏西可乐公司等都建立起来。美国和吴庭艳正在筹划增设冰箱装配厂、福特汽车装配厂一类的企业。
    据缅甸“民族报”今年7月透露的消息，美国垄断资本正在积极企图打入缅甸的石油开采业。美国垄断资本家对缅甸“颇有兴趣”。在巴基斯坦，美国的大通银行、欧文信托公司银行早已在那里开业。美国的纽约美孚油公司和美孚油公司获得了开采和经营俾路支油田的特权。1954年还创立了美巴石油公司。
    美国垄断资本在东南亚的渗透，达到了无孔不入的程度。
      千方百计攫取利润
    美国垄断资本集团企图奴役东南亚地区、反对东南亚国家经济独立发展、企图使东南亚成为美国工业品销售市场和原料产地。
    美国的几个钢铁托拉斯——美国钢铁公司、伯利恒钢铁公司和共和钢铁公司——在受巴基斯坦政府委托调查巴基斯坦发展冶金工业的可能性时，硬说巴基斯坦没有这种可能性，并且建议巴基斯坦从国外输入钢铁。
    在泰国的美孚油公司，竟因泰国计划建立炼油厂向泰国当局提出质问，要求泰国放弃建立自己的石油工业的计划。
    在吴庭艳傀儡政权统治下的南越，美国消费品充斥。南越每年被迫从美国进口各种布匹约一亿五千万公尺，而南越当地的需要只有一亿公尺。南越的一万五千多台纺织机，已有一万零五百二十台被迫停工。
    除了直接投资以外，美国垄断资本组织还利用所谓“美援”作为资本输出的一种方式。“美援”破坏了东南亚国家的农业生产，例如，美国通过“美援”强行销售美国堆积的“剩余”农产品，结果使缅甸、泰国失去了它们过去在日本、印度等地的大米销售市场。
    美国垄断资本组织利用直接投资，在东南亚建立自己的工业企业、运输公司、港口建筑、堆栈、仓库、农场、种植园。美国垄断组织通过它的公司、分公司以及由美国资本和当地企业或商人合办的公司取得巨大的利润。美国垄断资本组织还把攫取的利润的一部分作为新的投资，以达到“一本万利”的目的。下列根据美国“现代商业概览”的统计数字编制的图表，可以作为美国垄断资本生财有道的一例：
    美国垄断资本在东南亚无孔不入的渗透，美国垄断资本家在东南亚进行的奴役、剥削和利润攫取，完全证明了列宁在“帝国主义是资本主义发展的最高阶段”中所指出的真理：
    “自由竞争占完全统治的旧资本主义底特征是商品输出。垄断制占统制的现代资本主义底特征是资本输出。”（附图片）
