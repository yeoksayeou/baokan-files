Editor's Note: On the eve of the departure of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, Korean poets wrote many enthusiastic poems to bid farewell to their comrades-in-arms who had shared weal and woe for eight years. Here are three of them.

　　Meritorious Service
　　Piao Bayang

　　This meritorious service is higher than Mount Tai,
　　This friendship is deeper than the sea,
　　In the most difficult years,
　　We jointly repelled the vicious enemy.
　　Bomber formations covered our motherland's clear sky,
　　Machine guns roared in our ears,
　　It was you who rushed to the Korean trenches,
　　Fighting shoulder to shoulder with us, shedding blood.
　　In the villages and cities reduced to ashes,
　　Removing the broken tiles and rebuilding homes,
　　It was you who carried bricks and stones to the construction sites,
　　Giving your hard work for us.
　　The bells of rural cooperatives rang,
　　Planting rice, harvesting, cultivating the fields,
　　It was you who solved the labor shortage,
　　Never caring about yourselves.
　　Today, although you are leaving here,
　　How can we forget:
　　That enthusiastic and trustworthy heroic bearing,
　　That friendship engraved in people's hearts.
　　Taedong River, sing a farewell song!
　　Yalu River, wave goodbye too!
　　The anti-US, aid-Korea warriors are returning!
　　The officers and soldiers who established meritorious service are returning in triumph!
　　The Liaodong Plain will also sing welcome songs,
　　The Yellow River will also compose triumphal marches,
　　Having established meritorious service in defending the country,
　　The six hundred million outstanding sons and daughters of the people are returning!
　　Taedong River, sing a farewell song!
　　Yalu River, wave goodbye too!
　　The warriors of our brotherly people are returning!
　　The officers and soldiers who established meritorious service are returning in triumph!

专栏：朝鲜诗人送别战友

    编者按：在中国人民志愿军回国前夕，朝鲜的诗人们写了许多热情洋溢的诗篇，送别八年来同甘苦、共患难的战友。这里发表的，是其中的三首。
    功勋
    朴八阳这功勋比泰山还高，这友谊比大海还深，在极艰苦的岁月里，我们共同击退凶恶的敌人。轰炸机群盖满祖国晴空，机关枪在我们耳边怒吼，是你们奔向朝鲜的战壕，同我们并肩流血战斗。在化为灰烬的农村城市，铲掉破碎的瓦砾重建家园，是你们背起砖石奔向工地，为我们付出辛勤的劳动。农村合作社响起了钟声，插秧收割耕田种地，是你们为解决劳动力不足，从不计较自己的一切。今天你们虽然离开这里，但是我们怎能忘记：那热情而信赖的英姿，那铭刻在人们心中的友情。大同江呵，唱起欢送之歌吧！鸭绿江呵，你也挥手致意吧！抗美援朝的战士回去了！建立功勋的官兵凯旋了！辽东平原也将唱起欢迎之歌，黄河万里也将谱出凯旋之曲，建立了保家卫国的功勋，六亿人民的优秀儿女回来了！大同江呵，唱起欢送之歌吧！鸭绿江呵，你也挥手致意吧！兄弟人民的战士回去了！建立功勋的官兵们凯旋了！
