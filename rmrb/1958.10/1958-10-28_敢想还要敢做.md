Dare to think is the premise of daring to do; daring to do is the result of daring to think. If thinking conforms to the laws of the development of objective things, it will definitely be achieved; everything that has been achieved was thought of beforehand. As the old saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." People wanted to go to heaven, and eventually created airships, airplanes, and artificial satellites. Who says there's no way to heaven?

However, on the other hand, daring to think in itself is not daring to do. Generally speaking, those who dare to think are those who dare to do, because the purpose of thinking is to do. In real life, some people can boldly imagine, but they are not bold enough when they actually do it, or in other words, daring to do lags behind daring to think. For example, County A first discovered the benefits of gravity-fed irrigation and summarized the experience of the masses. It can be said that the problem of daring to think has been solved. However, actual actions did not keep up, and efforts were not made to promote it vigorously. After seeing the experience introduction of County A, County B immediately vigorously promoted it throughout the county, and as a result, County B's achievements in gravity-fed irrigation were much greater than those of County A. This clearly shows that under the premise of daring to think and daring to speak, there must be resolute and vigorous practical actions, so that ideal things can quickly become real things. This relationship between thinking and doing is essentially the relationship between planning and measures plus effort. Advanced targets, if not guaranteed by resolute and forceful measures and double the effort, are in danger of falling through. Similarly, bold romantic fantasies, if not backed by a solid realistic spirit, that romanticism will ultimately be just romanticism.

Therefore, once we have thought of something, we should take strong measures, do it in a vigorous manner, do it with all our strength, and be sure to turn the beautiful ideal into a vivid reality. The realization of ideals will further encourage people to boldly imagine and boldly create; new ideals and originality will drive people to work with redoubled spirit and high morale. This cycle repeats itself endlessly; this is the dialectical relationship of mutual promotion and mutual causation between daring to think and daring to do.

    敢想还要敢做
    杨建树
    敢想是敢作的前提，敢作是敢想的结果。想的只要合乎客观事物的发展规律，就一定能够做到；凡是做到了的，也都是事前想到了的。老话说得好：“有所欲，方有所为”。人们想上天，终究就制造出了轻气球、飞机、人造卫星。谁说上天无路呢？
  但是，另一方面，敢想本身并不就是敢作。一般地说，敢想的人，是敢作的，因为想的目的是为了作。在现实生活中，有些人能大胆的设想，但干起来却不够大胆，或者说，敢作落后于敢想。例如甲县首先发现了水利自流化的好处，并总结了群众的经验，敢想的问题可以说是解决了。但是实际行动没有紧跟上去，没有去大力推广。乙县看到甲县的经验介绍之后，立即在全县大力推广，结果乙县水利自流化的成就比甲县大得多。这就清楚地说明了，在敢想敢说的前提之下，必须有坚决有力的实际行动，这样，才能使理想的东西很快地变为现实的东西。这种想和作的关系，实质上也就是规划和措施加干劲的关系。先进的指标，如果没有坚决有力的措施和双倍的干劲来作保证，那是有落空的危险的。同样，大胆的浪漫主义的设想，如没有踏实的现实主义精神作后盾，那浪漫主义终究只是浪漫主义。
    因此，想到了，就应采取有力的措施，轰轰烈烈地干，全力以赴地干，务必使美丽的理想变为活生生的现实。理想实现了，就更能鼓舞人们大胆设想，大胆独创；新的理想和独创，又驱使人们精神百倍，斗志昂扬的去干，这样循环往复，以至无穷；这就是敢想和敢作的相互促进，互为因果的辩证关系。
