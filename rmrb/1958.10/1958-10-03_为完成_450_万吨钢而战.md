Fight to Complete 4.5 Million Tons of Steel
　　Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company Yuan Zhen

The 1958 National Day has arrived, and all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are greeting this great festival with immense excitement and a firm fighting spirit.

This year is a year of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. Under the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country have achieved brilliant victories on the agricultural front and have launched a mass movement of the whole Party and the entire people to vigorously develop the steel industry throughout the country. In this enthusiastic movement, all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have put forward their own goals: this year, they must overfulfill the production task of 4.5 million tons of steel, which will be a 55% increase compared to 1957. All employees recognize the important significance of completing this task for the nation's goal of producing 10.7 million tons of steel. At the same time, they feel that this is an extremely glorious task.

Under the care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, recently Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Li Fuchun of the Party Central Committee and others came to Anshan Iron and Steel Company for inspection. Their encouragement to all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has given us tremendous encouragement. The report of Comrade Li Fuchun has been widely discussed among all employees, and in accordance with the spirit of the report, a great airing of views, a great blooming, a great contention, and a great debate have been launched. We are now confidently throwing ourselves into the intense battle to complete the glorious task of 4.5 million tons of steel ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. Although Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steel production has made some progress, compared with advanced fraternal units, the speed is not fast enough. The main technical and economic indicators of steel production—the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces and the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces—are still far behind the advanced Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant. The main reason for our backwardness, as Comrade Li Fuchun pointed out in his speech to all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, is that some of our leading cadres and technicians have not completely liberated their minds, lack the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and have not thoroughly implemented the mass line method of work. Therefore, we cannot quickly reach the level we require in production.

The development of production inevitably reflects the struggle between two different ideologies: the Leap Forward and conservatism. The faster the development, the more intense the struggle will be. When advanced thinking occupies a dominant position, production can rise rapidly. Conversely, when conservative ideology prevails, production will inevitably stagnate. In the battle to complete 4.5 million tons of steel, ideology remains a serious struggle. In order to improve the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces, we have taken measures to increase the charging amount. The "condition theorists" and the "autumn reckoning faction" came out to predict that after increasing the charging amount, the furnace would break down, and the gains would not outweigh the losses. In production, slight setbacks led to even more unhealthy tendencies. However, we mobilized the masses to take measures. After increasing the charging amount, Open-Hearth Furnace No. 16 of the Second Steelmaking Plant still created a record of 5 hours and 40 minutes for each furnace's smelting time. Especially after listening to Comrade Li Fuchun's report, the Second Steelmaking Plant created a new record of 7,030 tons of daily output, with a utilization coefficient of 10.63, an increase of 30% compared to the past average level. Recently, Open-Hearth Furnace No. 9 of the First Steelmaking Plant produced seven furnaces of steel in two days due to the increased charging amount, and the utilization coefficient has reached above 14. These all show that increasing the charging amount and shortening the smelting time are not contradictory, and they will never damage the furnace, but can be carried out simultaneously. Similarly, in ironmaking, we also encountered the obstruction of conservative thinking. We believe that it is entirely possible to launch satellites and plant red flags in production by improving the utilization coefficients of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. The key lies in liberating our minds, putting politics in command, using politics to command technology and economy, mobilizing the masses, and launching a major technical revolution. Only in this way can we have a greater leap forward in production.

Completing the production task of 4.5 million tons of steel is an intense production battle. Comrade Li Fuchun encouraged us: whoever has more communist ideas can create greater miracles. The employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have accepted this beneficial teaching. In the production battle, we will further liberate our minds, establish the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, thoroughly implement the mass line, fully mobilize the masses, launch a major technical revolution in steel production, and raise production to a brand-new level.

### 为完成450万吨钢而战

    为完成450万吨钢而战
    鞍山钢铁公司经理　袁振
    1958年的国庆节到来了，鞍钢全体职工以万分兴奋和坚决战斗的心情，迎接这个伟大的节日。
    今年是我国社会主义建设大跃进的一年，全国人民在党中央和毛主席的伟大号召下，在农业战线上取得了辉煌的胜利以后，已经在全国范围内，展开了全党全民大办钢铁工业的群众性运动。鞍钢全体职工在这个热火朝天的运动中，提出了自己的奋斗目标：今年必须超额完成四百五十万吨钢的生产任务，这一任务将比1957年增加55％。全体职工认识到完成这一任务对于全国完成一千零七十万吨钢的重要意义，同时也感觉到这是一项极其光荣的任务。
    在党中央和毛主席的关怀下，最近党中央邓小平同志和李富春同志等来鞍钢视察，对鞍钢全体职工的勉励，给了我们极大的鼓舞。在全体职工中，已经普遍讨论了李富春同志的报告，并根据报告精神，展开了大鸣大放大争大辩，正信心百倍地在为提前和超额完成四百五十万吨钢的光荣任务投入了紧张的战斗，现在，鞍钢的钢铁生产虽然有某些进展，但与先进的兄弟单位比较、速度是不够快的。钢铁生产上的主要技术经济指标——平炉利用系数和高炉利用系数——还远落在先进的上钢三厂和本溪一厂的后面，我们落后的原因主要是正如李富春副总理在对鞍钢全体职工的讲话中所提到的是由于在我们部分领导干部和技术人员中还没有彻底解放思想，缺乏共产主义的敢想敢说敢做的风格，还没有彻底的贯彻群众路线的工作方法。因此我们在生产上还不能迅速地达到我们所要求的水平。
    生产的发展，必然反映着跃进与保守的两种不同思想的斗争，发展愈快，斗争必将更加激烈。当先进的思想占着统治地位的时候，生产就能迅速上升，相反地，当保守主义思想占上风的时候，生产就必然停滞不前。在完成四百五十万吨钢的战斗中，在思想上仍然是一场严重的斗争。为了提高平炉利用系数，我们采取了扩大装入量的措施，“条件论”者和“秋后算账派”出来预言了，他们说：扩大装入量以后，炉子就坏了，是得不偿失的。在生产中，稍有挫折，歪风更盛，但我们发动群众采取了措施，二炼钢16号平炉在扩大装入量以后，仍创造了每炉钢熔炼时间五点四十分的纪录，特别是听了李富春同志的报告后，二炼钢创造了日产七千零三十吨的新纪录，利用系数达到十点六三，比过去的平均水平提高30％。最近一炼钢九号平炉由于扩大了装入量，两天出了七炉钢，利用系数已可达到十四以上，这些都说明扩大装入量和缩短熔炼时间，并不矛盾，也决不会搞坏炉子，而是完全可以同时并举的。同样在炼铁方面，也遇到保守思想的阻挠。我们认为提高高炉和平炉的利用系数在生产上放卫星插红旗，是完全可能的。关键在于思想解放、政治挂帅，以政治统帅技术，统帅经济，发动群众，大闹技术革命，只有这样，我们才能在生产上有更大的跃进。
    完成四百五十万吨钢的生产任务是一场紧张的生产战斗。李富春同志勉励我们：谁有更多的共产主义思想，谁就能够创造更大奇迹。鞍钢职工接受了这个有益的教导，在生产战斗中，我们将进一步解放思想，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，彻底贯彻群众路线，充分发动群众，在钢铁生产上大闹技术革命，把生产提高到一个崭新的水平。（附图片）
