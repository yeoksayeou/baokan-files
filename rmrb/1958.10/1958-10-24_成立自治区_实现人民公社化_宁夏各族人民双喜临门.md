Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 23rd -- While joyfully welcoming the establishment of the autonomous region, Ningxia basically achieved people's commune-ization throughout the region on October 20th. In recent days, gongs and drums have been resounding in the Ningxia area, and songs have been soaring, as nearly two million Hui and Han people celebrate the double happiness.

A total of 157 people's communes integrating townships and communes have been established throughout the region, with more than 310,000 peasant households joining the communes, accounting for 95.91% of the total number of households in the region, with an average of more than 1,970 households per commune. After Zhongning County took the lead in realizing people's commune-ization in the Ningxia area in mid-September, a vigorous upsurge swept across the region, and in just one and a half months, all 19 counties and cities had mounted the steed of people's communes.

    据新华社银川23日电　宁夏人民在欢欣鼓舞迎接自治区成立的同时，全区在10月20日基本上实现了人民公社化。连日来，宁夏地区锣鼓喧天，歌声飞扬，近二百万回、汉族人民欢庆双喜临门。
    全区共已建立了乡社合一的人民公社一百五十七个，入社农户三十一万多户，占全区总农户的95.91％，平均每个公社有一千九百七十多户。9月中旬，中宁县在宁夏地区第一个实现人民公社化以后，全区各地风起云涌，仅仅在一个半月之内，十九个县市全部跨上了人民公社的骏马。
