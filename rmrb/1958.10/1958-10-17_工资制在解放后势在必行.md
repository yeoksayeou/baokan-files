Editor's Note: The following two articles are readers' opinions on Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article "Breaking Down Bourgeois Legal Concepts" published in this newspaper on the 13th. Both articles affirm Zhang's evaluation of the supply system, but both also believe that there was nothing wrong with implementing the wage system after liberation, and that it was an inevitable product of the situation at the time. They are now published together for discussion.

	The Wage System Was Inevitable After Liberation
	Liu Yi

	After reading Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article "Breaking Down Bourgeois Legal Concepts," I was reminded of the supply system life more than 30 years ago. At that time, each cadre had six jin of millet as pocket money per month in addition to food and clothing. Life was indeed very hard, but as Comrade Zhang Chunqiao pointed out, "people considered it glorious." Because in the minds of these people, what they were thinking about was not personal comfort, enjoyment, and treatment, but how to overthrow the rule of the three major enemies as soon as possible and rescue the Chinese people from dire straits. Although life was hard, they were full of energy. This life of military communism cultivated a simple, strong cadre team closely connected with the masses for our party, which became the backbone of the country's work in various fields. At the same time, under the circumstances of the enemy's economic blockade and extreme scarcity of materials, the supply system ensured a certain standard of living for the organs and troops, enabling the revolutionary war to persist and achieve final victory. It can be seen that the supply system has made indelible contributions to ensuring the victory of the revolution and educating and training cadres. The hard-working and simple style and communist spirit formed by the supply system life have become one of the fine traditions of our party. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's views in this regard are correct.

	The Supply System Could Not Adapt to the Situation After Liberation

	However, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's view that the supply system was gradually abolished and the wage system was implemented after the national liberation is not comprehensive enough.

	The gradual abolition of the supply system was mainly not the result of some people attacking it, nor was it the result of being influenced by the bourgeoisie, discarding our own good things, and picking up the bourgeoisie's hierarchical system. Rather, it was because after the national liberation, the situation changed and production continued to develop, so that the distribution method of the supply system, which was suitable for the war period, could not fully meet the needs of the time. After the national liberation, the focus of the party's work shifted from rural areas to cities. At this time, we not only had agriculture, but also had industry, various departments of the national economy, and various teams of workers. In such an all-encompassing system, it would be very difficult to continue to implement the single supply system of the war period. What's more, at that time, we were taking over the Kuomintang's legacy. Many problems left over by the Kuomintang could not be solved all at once. Therefore, it was correct and wise for the party to take over the staff of the old regime at that time, so that social life could proceed normally, which was beneficial to the restoration and transformation of the national economy. In order to cultivate technical forces and change the backward situation of our country's weak technical forces, it was also correct to implement the wage system in the technical and cultural and educational departments, which had already begun to implement the wage system before the national liberation. As for the full implementation of the wage system after 1955, this was a measure to gradually improve people's lives with the development of production, and at the same time, it was also conducive to overcoming some of the shortcomings of the supply system at that time.

	Wage System - Using Capitalist Forms
		To Serve Socialism

	Of course, the wage system is only a distribution method in the socialist stage, which is based on the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." The reason for this is that at this stage, social material wealth is not extremely abundant, and people lack a high degree of communist consciousness. Socialism has just emerged from the decaying capitalist body, and some capitalist economic forms are still retained. Commodity production, commodity circulation, the law of value, currency, and forms such as wages still exist in the socialist stage, but they have new content. They are used to develop socialist economic forms and fight against capitalism, rather than picking up the bourgeoisie's leftovers as treasures. Therefore, after entering socialist construction, our country adopted the wage system in the distribution method, which is not a retrogression to capitalism, but only uses capitalist forms to serve socialist construction.

	Since wages are a form left over from capitalism, and due to the difference between mental and physical labor, the difference between urban and rural areas, and the remnants of bourgeois legal concepts in people's minds created and left over by capitalist society, some people regard "to each according to his work" as an absolute truth, as a matter of course, and thus problems such as making trouble about grades and treatment have emerged. What is the solution to these problems? It is rectification, it is putting politics in command. Facts have proved that at present, workers are no longer interested in piece-rate wages, and writers and authors are no longer interested in high royalties, and they have asked to cancel or reduce them one after another. This shows that people's capitalist ideological remnants are gradually disappearing, communist ideology is gradually growing, communist ideology continues to grow, and the continuous improvement of social productivity will make the "to each according to his work" wage distribution form replaced by a more advanced distribution form. But this does not mean that it was originally wrong to abolish the supply system and implement the wage system.

	Cannot Denigrate the Wage System as a Hierarchical System

	Comrade Zhang Chunqiao also believes that we have inherited and systematized and institutionalized the unequal hierarchical system of the bourgeoisie, which is even more inconsistent with objective reality. The wage system we implement, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, is a low-wage system, the purpose of which is to have three people's food eaten by five people, so that more people are employed and social production develops faster. Moreover, our state workers are servants of the people. After the implementation of the salary system, state workers still maintain the hard-working and simple style of building the country diligently and thriftily. If we do not see this aspect, but simply exaggerate the difference in wage treatment, and thus think that we have institutionalized the hierarchical system, this is obviously very one-sided. Even the previous supply system still had some differences, but they were smaller than the current wage system. Of course, it cannot be considered that the difference between wages is always reasonable. This difference reflects the inequality between people at the present stage, which is a problem left over from capitalist society. In the future, when the difference between workers and peasants, the difference between urban and rural areas, and the difference between physical and mental labor disappear, this inequality will naturally no longer exist. This is the goal we strive to achieve. But this has nothing in common with the absolute egalitarianism demanded by people with petty-bourgeois fantasies. Chairman Mao had already pointed out in the article "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party": "Absolute egalitarianism is only a fantasy of the peasant petty-bourgeois not only in the period when capitalism has not been eliminated; even in the socialist period, the distribution of materials must also be based on the principle of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his work' and the needs of work, and there is no so-called absolute average." Absolute egalitarianism is not communist ideology, but only a fantasy based on selfishness of the petty-bourgeoisie. At present, in opposing bourgeois legal concepts, we should correctly explain to the people that "to each according to his work" is not the supreme principle, and should gradually transition to the communist distribution principle of "to each according to his needs" to cultivate people's communist ideology. It is not to deny everything in the past, or to denigrate our wage system as a hierarchical system from the perspective of absolute egalitarianism.

	Supply System - Wage System - Supply System
	A Spiral Development from Low to High

	At present, people's communes have been basically realized in rural areas throughout the country. The degree of collectivization of this organizational form is higher, and it has broken through the framework of collective ownership in many aspects. In terms of distribution, some new methods have also been adopted, such as implementing grain supply plus wage system. Other departments are also brewing to implement the supply system. This is a symbol of moving towards communism, and it is a gratifying phenomenon. But this is by no means simply restoring the past supply system, not because the implementation of the wage system after the national liberation has taken a detour and brought trouble. But it is implemented at a higher level and on a wider scale. Therefore, the change from the supply system before the national liberation to the wage system afterwards, and then to the supply system now and in the future, each reflects the level of production and people's consciousness under the conditions at that time. It is a spiral development from low to high, and it is a sign of our country's transition from socialism to communism.

### 工资制在解放后势在必行

专栏：

    编者按：下面这两篇文章是读者对本报十三日所载张春桥同志的“破除资产阶级的法权思想”一文的意见。两篇文章都肯定了张文对于供给制的评价，但也都认为解放以后实行工资制并没有什么错误，而是适应当时形势的必然产物。现在一并发表出来，供大家讨论。
    工资制在解放后势在必行
    刘艺
    看了张春桥同志的文章“破除资产阶级的法权思想”以后，使我回想起三十多年前的供给制生活。那时，每个干部除了吃穿之外，每月有六斤小米的零用钱，生活确实很艰苦，但也确如张春桥同志指出的“人们认为是光荣的”。因为在这些人的头脑里，想的不是个人的安逸享受和待遇，而是如何尽快地推翻三大敌人的统治，把全中国人民从水深火热之中解救出来。虽然生活苦，可是干劲十足，这种军事共产主义性质的生活，为我们党培养出了一支朴实坚强、密切联系群众的干部队伍，成为国家各方面工作中的骨干。同时，在敌人实行经济封锁，物资非常缺乏的情况下，供给制保证了机关部队的一定生活水平。使革命战争得以坚持，并且取得了最后胜利。由此可见，供给制在保证革命胜利和教育、锻炼干部等方面，都有不可磨灭的贡献。供给制生活所形成的艰苦朴素作风和共产主义风格，成了我们党的优良传统之一。张春桥同志这方面的见解是正确的。
    供给制不能适应解放后的形势
    但张春桥同志对于全国解放后逐渐取消了供给制实行了工资制的看法是不够全面的。
    供给制的逐步取消，主要的不是某些人对它实行攻击的结果。不是我们受了资产阶级的影响，把自己的好东西扔掉，拾起了资产阶级的等级制度的结果。而是由于全国解放后，形势发生了变化和生产不断地发展，因而使适应战争时期的供给制的分配方法，不能完全适应当时的需要了。全国解放后，党的工作重心由农村转向城市。这时，我们不仅有农业，而且有了工业，有了国民经济的各个部门，有了各种各样的工作人员队伍。在这样一个包罗万象的体系里，仍然实行战时的单一的供给制，不用说是有着许多困难的。何况，当时我们接收的是国民党的遗产。国民党遗留下来的许多问题不是一下子都可以解决的。因此，党当时对旧政权的工作人员采取包下来的做法是正确的、英明的。使社会生活得以正常进行，对国民经济的恢复和改造有利。为了培养技术力量，改变我国技术力量薄弱的落后状况，在技术部门、文教部门实行了工资制也是正确的，这些部门在全国解放以前就已经开始实行工资制了。至于1955年以后全面实行了工资制，这是随着生产的发展逐步改善人民生活的一个措施，同时也有利于克服当时供给制所存在的一些缺点。
    工资制——利用资本主义形式
          为社会主义服务
    当然，工资制只是社会主义阶段的一种分配方法，它根据的是“各尽所能、按劳取酬”的原则。所以如此，是因为在这个时期社会物质财富还不是极其丰富，人们还缺乏高度的共产主义觉悟。社会主义刚刚从腐烂的资本主义躯壳里脱颖而出，资本主义的一些经济形式仍然保留了下来。商品生产、商品流通、价值法则、货币以及工资等形式在社会主义阶段还是存在的，但是它们有了新的内容，它们被用来发展社会主义经济形式，同资本主义作斗争，而不是拾来资产阶级的牙慧当宝贝。因此，我国在进入社会主义建设之后，在分配方法上采用了工资制，并不是向资本主义倒退，只是利用资本主义的形式来为社会主义建设服务。
    由于工资是一种资本主义遗留下来的形式，又由于资本主义社会造成和遗留下来的脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别、城市和乡村的差别，以及人们思想中的资产阶级法权残余，使得一些人把“按劳取酬”看成了绝对真理，看成了天经地义，因而出现了闹级别闹待遇等问题。解决这些问题的办法是什么呢？是整风，是政治挂帅。事实证明，目前工人对计件工资，作家和作者对高额稿费已不再感兴趣，纷纷要求取消或降低，这表明了人们的资本主义思想残余在逐步消失，共产主义思想逐步成长，共产主义思想继续增长，社会生产力继续提高，将使“按劳取酬”的工资制分配形式为更高级的分配形式所代替。但这并不是说原来就不该取消供给制实行工资制。
      不能把工资制毁之为等级制
    张春桥同志还认为我们把资产阶级不平等的等级制度继承下来并且系统化和制度化了，这更是不合乎客观实际的。我们实行的工资制，正如邓小平同志所说的，是一种低薪制，目的是三个人的饭五个人吃，使就业的人数更多，社会生产发展更快。而且我们的国家工作人员是人民的勤务员。在实行了薪金制以后，国家工作人员也还是保持了勤俭建国的艰苦朴素作风。如果看不到这一面，而单纯夸大工资待遇间的差别，由此认为我们把等级制制度化了，这显然是十分片面的。就是以前实行的供给制，也还是存在一些差别的，不过比起现行的工资制要小一些就是了。当然，不能认为工资之间的差别永远是合理的，这个差别反映了现阶段人和人之间的不平等，这是资本主义社会遗留下来的问题。将来工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别消失了，这种不平等自然就不存在了，这是我们所努力追求的目标。但这和抱有小资产阶级幻想的人所要求的绝对平均主义，是没有丝毫共同之点的。毛主席早已在“关于纠正党内的错误思想”一文中指出：“绝对平均主义不但在资本主义没有消灭的时期，只是农民小资产者的一种幻想；就是在社会主义时期，物质的分配也要按照‘各尽所能各取所值’的原则和工作的需要，决无所谓绝对的平均。”绝对平均主义不是共产主义思想，只是小资产阶级基于自私自利的一种幻想而已。我们目前反对资产阶级法权思想，应该正确向人民阐明“按劳取酬”并不是最高原则，应逐步向“各取所需”的共产主义分配原则过渡，来培养人们的共产主义思想。而不是把过去的一概否定，或从绝对平均主义出发把我们实行的工资制毁之为等级制。
    供给制——工资制——供给制
      由低级到高级的螺旋式发展
    目前，全国农村已基本上实现人民公社化。这种组织形式的集体化程度更高，很多方面已冲破了集体所有制的框子。在分配方面也采取了一些新的做法，实行口粮供给加工资制。其他部门也有酝酿实行供给制的。这是向共产主义迈进的象征，是可喜的现象。但这绝不是简单地恢复过去的供给制，不是因为全国解放后实行工资制走了弯路带来了麻烦。而是在更高的水平上在更广泛的范围内实行的。因此，由全国解放前的供给制变为以后的工资制，再变为现在和将来的供给制，各自反映了当时条件下的生产水平和人们的意识，是由低级到高级的螺旋式的发展，是我国由社会主义向共产主义过渡的一个标志。
