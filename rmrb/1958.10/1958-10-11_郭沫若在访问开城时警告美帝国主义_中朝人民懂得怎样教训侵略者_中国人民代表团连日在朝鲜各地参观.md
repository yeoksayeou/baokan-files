Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 10th. Headed by Guo Moruo, the Chinese People's Delegation, accompanied by Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myong-hui, arrived in Kaesong this morning by special train for a visit.

The delegation was warmly welcomed by leading party and government officials of Kaesong and more than 10,000 citizens. Major General Jiang Shanghao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, also welcomed the delegation at the station.

Kim Myong-ho, Chairman of the Kaesong City People's Committee, delivered a speech at the welcoming rally held on the square in front of the station, saying that Kaesong was the place where U.S. imperialism was forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. If the U.S. imperialists forget the lessons of the Korean War and dare to continue provocations against the people of China and Korea, they will suffer an even more shameful and disastrous defeat than the defeat on the Korean battlefield. After Kim Myong-ho's speech, he presented a silk banner to head of the delegation Guo Moruo on behalf of the people of Kaesong.

Guo Moruo delivered a speech amidst warm cheers and applause. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the grand welcome from the people of Kaesong. He said, today we have come to Kaesong, which stands at the forefront of peace. Here, we once forced the extremely frantic U.S. imperialists to sit down and negotiate with us. Here, we once declared to the world the failure of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression.

Guo Moruo also said that after the war, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the people of Kaesong have engaged in selfless labor, transforming a consumer city into a new type of light industrial city. The brilliant achievements made by the people of Kaesong in socialist construction eloquently demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Guo Moruo said that during the eight years of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, they received meticulous care from the Korean brothers and sisters. On the eve of their departure from Korea, they were once again bidden farewell by the Korean people. I, on behalf of the Chinese people, express my heartfelt gratitude to you. Guo Moruo said that the Chinese People's Volunteers will soon be completely withdrawn to China. Their return home is to promote peace in Asia, but their return home will not change the Chinese people's international obligations to our Korean brothers in the slightest.

Guo Moruo said that China and Korea are both countries that desire peace. However, U.S. imperialism is still occupying South Korea and is turning South Korea into a base for atomic bombs. U.S. imperialism is also still occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and has recently carried out serious military provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area, even using "Sidewinder" missiles for the first time, frantically obstructing China from liberating its own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands. The serious crimes of U.S. imperialism in attempting to undermine peace in Asia and the world have aroused strong condemnation from the people of the world. Guo Moruo said that the friendship between China and Korea, forged in blood, can never be separated. The Korean people resolutely support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate their own territory, and the Chinese people also resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle to demand the prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea and to strive for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

Guo Moruo said that we firmly believe that we will definitely achieve final victory. If the U.S. aggressors dare to impose war on us, the people of China and Korea know how to teach the aggressors a lesson. The people of China and Korea will advance shoulder to shoulder along the broad road of socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 10th. This morning, the Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo laid wreaths at the Cemetery of the Martyrs of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers at the foot of Songaksan Mountain in the northern suburbs of Kaesong. After Guo Moruo, the head of the delegation, and Gan Siqi, the deputy head, and all members of the delegation laid wreaths, they stood in silent tribute before the martyrs' tombs. Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myong-hui, Major General Jiang Shanghao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, and others participated in the wreath-laying ceremony.

This newspaper's comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency: In the past few days, the Chinese People's Delegation, accompanied by Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myong-hui, has been visiting various places in Korea.

On the 5th, the delegation visited the Heechon Machine Tool Factory and the Heechon Precision Machinery Factory in the Heechon area, and they were warmly welcomed by the local people. The delegation also paid respects to the tombs of the Chinese People's Volunteer martyrs in the local area.

On the 6th, the Chinese People's Delegation, accompanied by Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myong-hui and others, visited the Supung Dam hydroelectric power station, which spans the Yalu River.

On the afternoon of the 7th, the delegation visited the Hwanghae Iron Works on the west coast of Korea.

On the 8th, the delegation spent a pleasant morning with the members of the Sambong Agricultural Cooperative in Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province, Korea. Guo Moruo, the head of the delegation, together with all members of the delegation, planted a pine tree on the hillside next to Sambong Village as a memento. At Guo Moruo's suggestion, the pine tree was named the "Friendship Pine" to symbolize the eternal friendship between the people of China and Korea.

    郭沫若在访问开城时警告美帝国主义
    中朝人民懂得怎样教训侵略者
    中国人民代表团连日在朝鲜各地参观
    新华社开城10日电　以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团在朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹的陪同下，今天早上乘专车到达开城访问。
    代表团受到开城党政负责人以及一万多市民的热烈欢迎。军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将也到车站欢迎代表团。
    开城市人民委员会委员长金明浩在车站前广场上举行的欢迎大会上发表讲话说，开城市曾经是美帝国主义被迫签订朝鲜停战协定的地方。美帝国主义者如果忘记朝鲜战争的教训，胆敢向中朝两国人民继续进行挑衅，它将遭到比在朝鲜战场上的失败更加可耻的惨败。金明浩讲话以后代表开城人民向郭沫若团长献锦旗。
    郭沫若在热烈的欢呼声和掌声中发表讲话。他对开城人民的盛大欢迎表示衷心的感谢。他说，今天我们来到屹立在和平前哨的开城市，在这里，我们曾经迫使疯狂无比的美帝国主义者不得不坐下来和我们谈判，在这里，我们曾经向全世界宣告美帝国主义侵略战争的失败。
    郭沫若又说，开城人民战后在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，进行了忘我的劳动，把一个消费城市变成了新型的轻工业城市。开城人民在进行社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，雄辩地说明了社会主义制度无比的优越性。
    郭沫若说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜八年的期间，受到朝鲜兄弟姊妹们的无微不至的爱护，在他们离开朝鲜的前夕，又受到朝鲜人民的欢送，我代表中国人民向你们表示衷心的感谢。郭沫若说，中国人民志愿军不久就要全部撤回中国了。他们回国是为了促进亚洲的和平，但是他们回国丝毫也不会改变中国人民对朝鲜兄弟的国际义务。
    郭沫若说，中朝两国都是希望和平的国家。但是，美帝国主义仍然霸占着南朝鲜，并且正在使南朝鲜变为原子弹基地。美帝国主义也仍然霸占着中国的领土台湾，最近在台湾海峡地区向中国进行了严重的军事挑衅，甚至第一次使用了“响尾蛇”式导弹，疯狂地阻挠中国解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿。美帝国主义企图破坏亚洲和世界和平的严重罪行已经引起了全世界人民的强烈谴责。郭沫若说，中朝两国用鲜血凝结起来的友谊是永远不能分开的，朝鲜人民坚决支持中国人民解放自己领土的正义斗争，中国人民也坚决支持朝鲜人民要求美军迅速撤出朝鲜、争取和平统一朝鲜的正义斗争。
    郭沫若说，我们坚决相信，我们是一定能够获得最后胜利的。如果美国侵略者敢于把战争强加在我们头上，中朝人民是知道如何教训侵略者的。中朝两国人民将肩并肩地沿着社会主义的康庄大道前进。
    新华社开城10日电　以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团今天上午到开城北郊松岳山麓的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军烈士陵园献了花圈。郭沫若团长、甘泗淇副团长和代表团全体成员献花圈后，在烈士墓前默哀致敬。朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹、军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊等参加了献花圈的仪式。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：几天来，中国人民代表团在朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹陪同下，在朝鲜各地进行访问。
    代表团在5日参观了熙川地区的熙川机床厂和熙川精密机械厂，他们受到了当地人民的热烈欢迎。代表团还向当地的中国人民志愿军烈士墓敬了花圈。
    6日中国人民代表团由朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹等陪同参观访问了横跨在鸭绿江上的水丰发电站。
    7日下午代表团访问了朝鲜西海岸的黄海制铁所。
    8日代表团同朝鲜平安南道平原郡三峰农业社的社员们欢度了一个上午。郭沫若团长同代表团全体成员一起，在三峰里村旁的山岗上种了一棵松树，留作纪念。根据郭沫若的提议，把这棵松树叫作“友谊松”，让它象征中朝两国人民的友谊，万古长青。
    中国人民代表团9日上午参观了南浦冶炼厂，受到了南浦市一万三千多群众的热烈欢迎。
