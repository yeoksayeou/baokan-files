Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th - During the general debate of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, Indian delegation leader Menon, in his speech on the 7th, demanded that the United States armed forces withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area and opposed the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Menon also pointed out that the United Nations cannot interfere in China's internal affairs.

Menon said that Taiwan is a part of China, and there is no doubt about this at any time. The Taiwan issue is not an international issue, but an internal affair to be resolved by the Chinese people themselves, a matter between two political parties in one country.

Menon said that India cannot ask the United Nations to interfere because he believes it is impossible. The bombardment of Jinmen cannot be separated from the issue of China's reunification. He said that the Chinese people have a great talent for reaching agreements. The two sides in the Chinese dispute should be encouraged to negotiate and create a situation in which "their entire motherland will be liberated."

Menon opposed the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. He said, "In any legal sense, Chiang Kai-shek is not an entity. Taiwan has always been a part of China, although it has a long colonial history." He said that the fundamental problem now is that a group of fugitives in Taiwan claim to be representatives of China and have stolen China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. He said that unless there is a real China in the United Nations, major world problems cannot be solved.

Menon also said that China has not threatened the security of other countries. According to the United Nations Charter, there is no question of China's eligibility to join the United Nations, because China is already a member of the United Nations.

Menon also refuted the slanderous rumors spread by the United States that China was the so-called "aggressor" in the Korean War. He said that there is no war in Korea today, and Chinese troops have withdrawn from Korea.

Menon demanded that the United States armed forces withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. He called for the use of the situation of China's announced cessation of bombardment of Jinmen to seek a "peaceful solution that recognizes reality." He also pointed out that any solution should be based on reality, law, and the recognition that Taiwan is a part of China.

    梅农要美军撤出台湾海峡地区
    并指出联合国不能对中国内政进行干涉
    据新华社8日讯　纽约消息：印度代表团团长梅农7日在联合国大会本届会议一般性辩论的发言中，要求美国军队撤出台湾海峡地区，并且反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。梅农还指出，联合国不能对中国内政进行干涉。
    梅农说，台湾是中国的一部分，这在任何时候都是没有疑问的。台湾问题并不是一个国际问题，而是一个要由中国人民自己来解决的内部事务问题，是一个国家里的两个政党的问题。
    梅农说，印度不能要求联合国进行干涉，因为他认为这是不可能的。炮轰金门是不能和中国统一的问题分开的。他说，中国人民有达成协议的伟大天才。应该鼓励中国争执双方进行谈判，并且造成一种使他们“整个祖国将获得解放的局面”。
    梅农反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。他说，“在任何法律的意义上，蒋介石都不是一个实体，台湾从来就是中国的一部分，虽然它有一个长期的殖民地历史”。他说，现在根本的问题是在台湾的一批亡命者自称是中国的代表并且窃取了中国在联合国中的合法席位。他说，除非在联合国中有真正的中国，否则主要的世界问题就不可能解决。
    梅农还说，中国并没有威胁其他国家的安全，根据联合国宪章，不存在什么中国参加联合国的资格问题，因为中国已经是联合国的会员国。
    梅农还驳斥了美国诬蔑中国是朝鲜战争中的所谓“侵略者”的诽谤性谰言，他说，今天在朝鲜并没有战争，而且中国军队已撤出了朝鲜。
    梅农要求美国军队撤出台湾海峡地区，他呼吁利用中国宣布停止炮轰金门的局势，求得一个“承认现实的和平解决办法”。他还指出，任何解决办法都应当以现实、法律和承认台湾是中国的一部分为基础。
