Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 10th: Shaanxi Province has achieved a complete bumper harvest of autumn crops. The total output of autumn grain can reach 12,907,980,000+ catties, an increase of 175.76% over last year. Adding the 6.2 billion catties of summer grain, the province's total grain output this year can reach 19,107,980,000+ catties, equivalent to 2.15 times last year's, with an average yield of 343.9 catties per mu. The province averages 1,059.8 catties of grain per person. Cotton, hemp, oil crops, and sugar crops have also achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. In addition to cotton reaching the level of a "100 catties of ginned cotton per province," the total output of sugar beets and sugarcane in the province has also increased more than fivefold compared to last year.

Currently, on the vast Guanzhong Plain, carts transporting crops are coming and going in an endless stream. In the threshing grounds, piles of haystacks are stacked higher than the rooftops. The biggest feature of this year's increase in production throughout the province is the significant increase in high-yield areas. Many areas that have needed to import grain every year since liberation now have surplus grain. The twelve counties in the Yulin area along the Great Wall are the area with the most grain shortage in the province, needing to import more than 100 million catties of grain every year. This year, the total grain output of the area reached 1.25 billion catties, nearly tripling last year's output, making it a surplus grain area.

The person in charge of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry told reporters that this year's bumper harvest, from the perspective of the agricultural department's leadership, mainly focused on the following aspects: First, grasping the work in backward areas and low-yield crops, so that all parts of the province achieved relatively balanced increases in production; Second, overcoming shallow sowing and planting in dry soil, so that all crops were deeply plowed, carefully cultivated, and fully fertilized; Third, grasping large-scale high yields, paying attention to promoting the experience created by "satellite fields" to large fields; Fourth, grasping autumn protection work, reducing various losses.

    陕西秋季作物全丰收
    粮食总产量比去年增一倍　经济作物样样高产
    据新华社西安10日电　陕西省秋季作物获得全面大丰收。秋粮总产量可达一百二十九亿零七百九十八万多斤，比去年增产175.76％。加上夏粮六十二亿斤，全省今年的粮食总产量可达一百九十一亿零七百九十八万多斤，等于去年的二点一五倍，平均亩产三百四十三点九斤。全省平均每人有一千零五十九点八斤粮食。棉、麻、油料作物和糖类作物也空前大丰收。除棉花达到百斤皮棉省以外，全省甜菜和甘蔗的总产量也比去年提高五倍以上。
    目前，在辽阔的关中大平原上，运送庄稼的大车络绎不绝。在打谷场上，一堆堆的草垛堆得比房顶还高。全省今年增产的最大特点是高产地区大大增多。有许多解放以来年年需要运进粮食的地区，现在也有了余粮。长城沿线榆林专区十二县，是全省缺粮最多的一个专区，每年都需要运进一亿多斤粮食。今年全区的粮食总产量达到十二亿五千万斤，比去年翻了将近两番，一跃成为余粮专区。
    陕西省农林厅的负责人告诉记者，今年获得大丰收，从农业部门的领导来说，主要是抓住了以下几个环节：一、抓落后地区的工作和低产作物，使全省各地都得到了比较平衡的增产；二、克服硬槎播种和白地下种，使所有的农作物都深耕细作和施饱了肥料；三、抓大面积丰产，注意把“卫星田”创造的经验向大田中推广；四、抓护秋工作，减少了各种损失。（附图片）
