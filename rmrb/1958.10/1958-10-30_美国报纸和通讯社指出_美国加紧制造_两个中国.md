Xinhua News Agency, October 26th—American newspapers, in commenting on the Dulles-Chiang talks' communique, emphasized that the current American policy is to intensify its plot to create "Two Chinas."

    The San Francisco "Chronicle" on the 24th hinted that the United States is pursuing the conspiracy of "Two Chinas." The "Chronicle" said, "Although the communique of the talks acknowledges that the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) is the true spokesman of free China, the fact is that the State Department is currently in contact with two Chinas and is prepared to deal with the Chinese Communists at any time as long as it is beneficial."

    The newspaper pointed out that the United States forced Chiang Kai-shek to abandon the plan to attack the mainland by force only to suit American interests. It said: Dulles, by "obtaining such a public statement" from Chiang Kai-shek, "gives himself more room for future action in formulating American policy toward the Far East."
      The "Chronicle" also smugly stated that Chiang Kai-shek's cause was finished from then on. The newspaper's columnist, Briar, wrote on the 24th: "The author is not aware of any example in history where a regime that has lost legitimate control over 99% of its people can use 1% of the people to reconquer the 99%."

    Russell, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, also wrote in the "Washington Daily News" that Dulles wanted Chiang Kai-shek to do this in order to create two Chinas. Russell wrote: "If the Communists stop using force in Kinmen and Matsu, then work can begin on building Formosa (Taiwan) into a free Chinese fortress."

    An editorial in the "Washington Post" also pointed out that the current American policy is to "emphasize the independence of Formosa (Taiwan)."

    The "New York Times" admitted on the 24th that the Dulles-Chiang talks' communique, even "at best, does not fundamentally change the difficult situation." The newspaper, which advocates that the United States should force Chiang's army to withdraw from Kinmen and Matsu to facilitate the American conspiracy to create "Two Chinas," said, "As long as they (Chiang Kai-shek's troops) remain there (referring to the coastal islands), there is a possibility of involving the United States in a war with China at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and for the wrong reasons." The newspaper believes that the outcome of this meeting did not relieve the United States of its "dilemma."

### 美国报纸和通讯社指出  美国加紧制造“两个中国”

    美国报纸和通讯社指出
    美国加紧制造“两个中国”
    新华社26日讯　美国一些报纸在评论杜、蒋会谈公报时，着重指出美国目前的政策是加紧推行它制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    旧金山“纪事报”在24日暗示，美国正在推行“两个中国”的阴谋。“纪事报”说，“尽管会谈的公报承认中华民国（指蒋介石集团）是自由中国的真正的发言人，事实是国务院目前正同两个中国接触，并且准备只要有好处，就随时同中国共产党打交道。”
    这家报纸指出，美国迫使蒋介石放弃以武力进攻大陆的计划，只是为了适合美国人自己的利益。它说：杜勒斯由于从蒋介石那里“取得这样一个公开的声明”，“就使得他自己将来在制定美国对远东的政策时有更多的活动余地”。
      “纪事报”还洋洋得意地说，蒋介石的事业是从此完蛋了。这家报纸的专栏作家布赖尔24日写道：“本作者还不知道历史上有过这样的例子：一个对于它的99％的人民失去合法控制的政权还能利用
  1％的人来重新征服那99％的人民。”
    斯克利浦斯——霍华德系报纸记者鲁塞耳在“华盛顿每日新闻”上发表的消息也认为，杜勒斯所以要蒋介石这样做是为了制造两个中国。鲁塞耳写道：“如果说在共产党人停止在金门、马祖使用武力，那就可以着手进行把福摩萨（台湾）建成一个自由中国堡垒的工作了。”
    “华盛顿邮报”的社论也指出，美国现在的政策是“强调福摩萨（台湾）的独立”。
    “纽约时报”在24日承认，杜、蒋会谈公报即使“从最好处说，也是困难的处境基本上没有改变”。这家主张由美国迫使蒋军撤出金马以利于美国制造“两个中国”阴谋的报纸说，“只要他们（蒋介石的军队）还留在那里（指沿海岛屿），就有可能使美国在错误的时间，错误的地点和由于错误的原因而卷入同中国的战争。”这家报纸认为，这次会谈的结果没有使美国“摆脱窘境”。
