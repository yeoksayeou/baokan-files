Deer Stockade soars,
Looking up, the sky seems too low,
The whole people strive for first place,
Red flags are planted everywhere.
Thirteen thousand heroes,
Waging a great battle on the iron ore mountain,
The mountain god is busy leading the way,
The earth god offers tea.
Heroes wave their hands,
Creating great records,
One furnace breaks ten thousand tons,
Bunkers are used as kilns.
Attacking fiercely for a couple of hours,
Iron smelting piles up like mountains,
More than two hundred thousand tons,
Arrive in our hands in one day.
Good news flashes like lightning,
Cheers reach the clouds,
The annual output of Guangxi,
Is completed by Deer Stockade in one day.
Heroes of the whole country,
Strive to compete together,
Wanting to surpass Deer Stockade,
And smash through Nantianmen.

    鹿寨腾地起
    俯拾鹿寨腾地起，抬头嫌天低，全民争第一，上下插红旗。英雄十三万，大战铁矿山，山神忙带路，土地捧茶碗。英雄手挥舞，创造大纪录，一炉破万吨，碉堡作窑炉。猛攻一对时，炼铁如山积，二十万余吨，一天到手里。喜报闪电传，欢声入云端，广西年产量，鹿寨一天完。全国英雄们，奋身齐竞争，要超鹿寨上，大破南天门。
