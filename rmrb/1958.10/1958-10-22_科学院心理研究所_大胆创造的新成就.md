    Bold New Achievements

    During the "Double-Anti" campaign, the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences criticized the bourgeois academic line and strengthened its ties with practical applications. Now, they have achieved remarkable results in areas such as labor psychology, educational psychology, and medical psychology.

    In the field of labor psychology, in collaboration with the Institute of Arts and Crafts, they used methods that inspire workers' creative thinking to promote the automation of universal strip feeding, semi-automation of single-piece feeding, and automation and semi-automation of 132 sets of punching dies in factories. This can improve the processing of over 300 types of similar stamped parts. This will not only reduce the labor intensity of punch press workers and ensure safety but also increase production efficiency by seven to ten times. In the field of educational psychology, in cooperation with educational departments, they are experimenting with teaching algebra in fifth grade of primary school. They have now completed teaching "linear equations" and the test results are good. It is estimated that this may make it possible for us to use algebra as a tool to complete the entire arithmetic curriculum that originally required three years to teach in the fifth and sixth grades of primary school and the first grade of junior high school in just over a year. This will be a bold innovation in primary school arithmetic teaching in our country. In the field of medical psychology, in cooperation with Beijing Medical College and Peking University, they conducted a rapid comprehensive treatment method (including psychology, sports, medicine, physiotherapy, etc.) on eighty college students with severe neurasthenia (average duration of illness of 3.8 years), mainly combining ideological education and implementing psychological treatment principles. After four weeks of treatment, all improved, with 82% recovering or significantly improving, creating a miracle in the treatment of neurasthenia.

    科学院心理研究所
    大胆创造的新成就
    中国科学院心理研究所在双反期间，批判了资产阶级学术路线，并加强了和实际的联系。现在，他们在劳动心理学、教育心理学和医学心理学等方面，都已取得了引人注意的成绩。
    在劳动心理学方面，他们和工艺研究院协作，用启发工人创造性思惟的方法，推动工厂工人完成冲床万能条料送料自动化、单料送料半自动化和一百三十二副冲模的自动化和半自动化，共可改进三百种以上同类型冲压件加工工序。这不但能减轻冲床工人的劳动强度，保证安全，并能提高生产效率七倍至十倍。在教育心理学方面，他们和教育部门合作，在小学五年级中试验讲授代数，现已教完“一元方程式”，测验成绩良好。估计这将有可能使我们以代数为工具，在一年多一点的时间内，教完原来小学五、六年级和初中一年级共需三年教完的全部算术课程。这对我国小学算术教学将是一个大胆的革新。在医学心理学方面，他们和北京医学院、北京大学合作，在八十名神经衰弱病情较重（平均病期三点八年）的大学生中，进行了以结合思想教育、贯彻心理治疗原则为主的快速综合治疗法（包括心理、体育、药物、理疗等）。经过四周治疗，全部好转，其中82％痊愈或显著好转，首创了神经衰弱治疗效果的奇迹。
