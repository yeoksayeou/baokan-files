Learning Philosophy is Very Beneficial

    A Copper Buddha is Copper, Not a God
    In Taiyuan City's Tiejiang (Blacksmith) Alley, housewives launched a major debate on the question of atheism versus theism during the national acquisition of scrap copper and iron. Those who had not studied philosophy said, "The copper Buddha is a god, and cannot be sold." Those who had studied philosophy said, "The copper Buddha is copper and can be sold." Those who had not studied philosophy said, "God protects people." Those who had studied philosophy said, "People protect God." In the end, the atheists finally persuaded the theists, broke down superstitions, liberated their thinking, and completed the task. (Zhi Wen)

专栏：学哲学好处多

    铜佛是铜不是神
    太原市铁匠巷家庭妇女，在国家收购废铜烂铁时，开展了一场关于无神与有神问题的大辩论。没有学过哲学的说：“铜佛是神，不能卖。”学过哲学的说，“铜佛是铜，可以卖。”没有学过哲学的说：“神保佑人。”学过哲学的说：“人保佑神。”最后，无神论者终于说服了有神论者，破除了迷信，解放了思想，完成了任务。　（志文）
