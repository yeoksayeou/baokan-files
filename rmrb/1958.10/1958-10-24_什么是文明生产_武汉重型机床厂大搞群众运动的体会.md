What is Civilized Production?
    —Experiences from the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant in Launching a Mass Movement
    By Our Reporter Hai Bo

    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, in the course of its mass movement, thoroughly criticized the erroneous idea that "mass movements are of little significance in large, modern factories," even opposing mass movements altogether, and brought about an astonishing leap forward in production.

    The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is currently China's largest and most modern heavy machine tool plant, with many of its devices being world-class. This plant was completed in July of this year. According to the original technical design, it would not reach its designed production capacity until 1964, with an annual output of 380 heavy machine tools, and only trial production and the manufacture of a small number of machine tools this year. However, since the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward, the situation in all aspects has presented new demands on this factory. The initial leap forward plan for this year was an annual output of forty-two heavy machine tools, which at the time seemed very difficult to achieve. But, in May, based on national requirements, the factory's plan leaped forward again to one hundred and thirty units, and in August, according to the spirit of the Central Political Bureau Enlarged Meeting, it leaped forward again to two hundred units for this year. This was four times the initial leap forward plan that was considered difficult to complete. Now, the production plan is being completed very smoothly. In September alone, thirty-four heavy machine tools were produced, approaching the production capacity to be reached in 1964.

    Why has this factory been able to achieve such a tremendous leap forward? Mainly because, under the leadership of the Party, it thoroughly criticized the bourgeois ideology of not trusting the masses and resolutely mobilized the masses. From the very beginning of the Great Leap Forward, this factory launched a struggle between two lines. One line was the path of vigorously having the masses run the factory, and the other was the path of having a few experts and technicians run the factory in a cold and quiet manner. When the leap forward plan was proposed, some people believed that although the task was large, as long as the mass movement was carried out vigorously, the masses were deeply mobilized, and everyone's wisdom was brought into play, the task could be completed or even overfulfilled. But others believed that this was impossible. They said: In a large, modern factory like the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, the existing equipment and production management systems are already the most scientific and civilized. The current task is to study hard, otherwise, it will damage "civilized production" and cause "chaos." What they meant was: It may be necessary to carry out mass movements in rural areas and in small, backward factories, but in large, modern factories, it is not only unnecessary but will even "disrupt production." They said: "The plan for one hundred and thirty units is bureaucratic and bureaucratic," "is just empty talk."

    Based on this situation, during the formulation of the second leap forward plan, on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign, the factory's Party committee launched a factory-wide debate, with the central question being whether the leap forward plan could be completed and how to achieve the Great Leap Forward. What is "civilized production?" After the masses were mobilized, as soon as the debate began, the factory's workers posted tens of thousands of big-character posters in just a few days, criticizing the fallacy that mass movements could not be carried out in large factories. The conservatives regarded the existing process regulations as the magic weapon for managing production and ensuring quality, while the workers felt that this was where most of the problems lay, hindering production and needing to be reformed. The workers did not deny that there should be certain process regulations in production, but the past process regulations were only written by a few technicians sitting in the office, were complicated and difficult to understand, and full of errors. Workers composed clappers: "Workshop technicians, mechanically follow old doctrines, sitting in high buildings, subjectively compiling a set, causing the workers to run their legs off." Because there were so many mistakes, workers often had to stop their machines to find process personnel. It was estimated that the workers in the factory spent a total of 460,000 work hours a year on process regulations.

    While the debate was going on, leading cadres and technicians were mobilized to combine with workers to compile process regulations. The Party committee's slogan was: "For the sake of one hundred and thirty (130 machine tools), technicians go to the workshop, first as apprentices, then as technicians." Under this slogan, the enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high, and the compilation was both fast and good. Old worker Liu Hui compiled the process for fourteen parts in one night, all of which were qualified. Old worker Wang Haifu reviewed and revised five sets of sample processes in less than twenty minutes, raising three important issues. These things would take the process personnel one or two days to complete on their own. As a result, the relationship between technicians and workers was unprecedentedly close. The process was generally reduced by more than 80%. The process regulations that used to be twenty or thirty pages long are now only two or three pages or even one page. Both workers and technicians said:
  "Now everyone is working together."

    In the face of a large number of facts, the conservatives were completely defeated. Facts prove that the mass line is the most civilized production.

    In order to further implement the mass line, the factory leaders resolutely implemented the decentralization of power. The powers they decided to decentralize included process, tool and fixture design, equipment operating procedures and maintenance, planning, attendance and leave, approval of rationalization proposals, labor protection, and quality inspection. These powers were decentralized to workshops and teams, greatly stimulating the creativity and enthusiasm of the workers, and tens of thousands of rationalization proposals were put forward. Difficult problems that were previously felt to be unsolvable were now quickly resolved. According to statistics, in September alone, there were 532 inventions and creations in the factory, of which 456 were made by workers. They have successfully designed four new machine tools with simplified structures. These machine tools have half the number of parts as the original, the manufacturing time is greatly shortened, the steel is saved by one-half, and the quality is even better than the original. This revolution has brought new prospects to the machinery industry. In the past, when workers ran out of tools, they waited for the supply department to supply them. If the supply was not available, they stopped work and waited for materials. Now, the general small tools and fixtures are manufactured by the workshop workers themselves. Old worker Jiang Xiaoyu used waste materials to manufacture an external cyclone, which is twenty times more efficient than the original foreign cyclone. The workers in the processing workshop themselves made more than 1,000 tools and fixtures using local methods, solving the difficulties of supply.

    什么是文明生产
    ——武汉重型机床厂大搞群众运动的体会
    本报记者　海波
    武汉重型机床厂在大搞群众运动中，彻底批判了“规模大、设备新的工厂搞群众运动的意义不大”，甚至反对搞群众运动的错误思想，使生产出现了惊人的跃进局面。
    武汉重型机床厂是我国目前规模最大、设备最新的重型机床厂，许多设备都是世界第一流的。这个厂在今年7月建成。按照原来的技术设计，到1964年生产能力才能达到设计标准，年产三百八十台重型机床，而今年只能试生产，制造很少的机床。但是，自从整风和生产大跃进以来，各方面的形势向这个工厂提出了新的要求，今年最初的跃进计划是年产重型机床四十二台，这在当时看来已经是很困难的事了。但是，到了5月，根据国家要求，这个厂的规划又跃进到一百三十台，而8月份根据中央政治局扩大会议精神，又跃进到今年年产二百台。比原先认为很难完成的第一次跃进计划翻了四番。现在，生产计划完成的很顺利，9月份一个月就生产了重型机床三十四台，接近1964年达到的生产能力。
    这个厂为什么能出现这样巨大的跃进呢？主要是由于在党的领导下，彻底批判了不相信群众的资产阶级思想，坚决发动了群众。这个厂在大跃进中一开始就展开了两条路线的斗争。一条是轰轰烈烈群众办工厂的道路，一条是冷冷清清由少数专家技术人员办工厂的道路。在跃进规划提出的时候，一部分人认为任务虽大，但只要大搞群众运动，深入发动群众、依靠群众，发挥大家的智慧，任务是可以完成甚至可以超额完成的。但另一部分人则认为这是不可能的。他们说：武汉重型机床厂这样厂子大设备新的工厂，已有的设备和生产管理制度都已经是最科学的了，是最文明的了，现在的任务是好好学习，否则就会破坏“文明生产”，就会“乱”。他们的意思是：在农村、在小的、设备落后的厂里搞群众运动或许必要，而在大的、设备新的厂不但没有必要，甚至会“破坏生产”。他们说：“一百三十台的计划是官僚又官僚”、“是纸上谈兵”。
    根据这一情况，在整风胜利的基础上，在订第二次跃进计划时，这个厂的党委发动了一个全厂规模的大辩论，辩论的中心问题是能不能完成跃进规划？怎样大跃进？怎样才算“文明生产？”群众发动起来，大辩论一开始，全厂职工几天之内就贴出了上万张大字报，批判了大厂不能搞群众运动的谬论。保守派把已有的工艺规程当作管理生产、保证质量的法宝，而工人恰恰感到这方面的问题最多，最妨碍生产，必须改革。工人不否认生产中要有一定的工艺规程，但是，过去的工艺规程只是由少数几个技术人员坐在办公室编的，复杂难懂，错误百出。工人编快板说：“车间技术员，死搬老教条，坐在高楼上，主观编一套，害得工人们，两腿跑断了。”因为错误很多，工人们就得常常停了机车去找工艺人员，估计全厂工人们花在工艺规程上的工夫，一年就要浪费四十六万个工时。
    在大辩论的同时，发动了领导干部和技术人员与工人结合起来编制工艺规程，党委的口号是：“为了一百三（130台机床），技术下车间，先当小徒工，后当技术员”，在这个口号下，群众情绪极高，而且编的又快又好。老工人刘辉一个晚上就编出了十四个零件的工艺，全部合格，老工人王海福不到二十分钟即审查修改了五套样板工艺，提出了三个重要问题。这些东西，如果给工艺员自己搞，一两天也搞不完。由于这样，使技术人员和工人的关系空前密切了。工艺一般比过去减少了80％以上，过去二三十页的工艺规程，现在只剩下两三页甚至一页了，工人和技术人员都说：
  “现在大家拧成一股绳了。”
    在大量事实面前，保守派彻底失败了。事实证明群众路线是最文明的生产。
    为了进一步贯彻群众路线，这个厂的领导又坚决实行了权力下放。他们决定下放的权力包括工艺、工卡具设计、设备操作规程和维修、计划、考勤请假、合理化建议批准权、劳动保护和质量检查等。这些权力分别下放到车间、班组，大大激发了职工的创造性和积极性，成千上万的合理化建议被提出来。过去感到无法解决的困难问题，现在很快都解决了。据统计，仅9月份全厂的发明创造即有五百三十二件，其中由工人作出的占四百五十六件。他们已设计成功了四种新的简化了结构的机床，这种机床比原来的零件少一半，制造时间大为缩短，钢材节约了二分之一，而质量还比原来的有所提高。这个革命给机械工业带来了新的远景。过去，工人们没了工具就等供应科供应，供应不上就停工待料，现在，一般小的工具卡具缺了都是由车间工人自己制造了。老工人姜小玉用废料制造了外旋风机，比原来的洋旋风机效率高二十倍。加工车间工人自己用土办法造的工卡具即有一千多件，解决了供应不上的困难。
