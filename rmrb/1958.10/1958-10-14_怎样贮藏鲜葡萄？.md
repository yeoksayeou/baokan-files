How to Store Fresh Grapes?
　　Grapes are a relatively delicate fruit variety and are not easy to store. After the grape harvest season has passed, it is not easy to eat inexpensive and delicious fresh grapes. Now I will introduce a simple warm room storage method for your reference.
　　The varieties suitable for storage are late-maturing dry grapes. Around the time of the Cold Dew solar term, after the grapes are picked, select branches with green stems, plump grains, and moderate maturity, and place them in small round baskets that can hold 60 to 70 catties (baskets are 1.2 feet high and 1.2 feet in diameter). Line the basket with two layers of paper. After the grapes are placed in the basket, cover the basket with two layers of paper and place it in a cool and ventilated place in the yard. When the Frost's Descent solar term arrives and the temperature drops to 3 to 4 degrees Celsius above zero, move them indoors.
　　Ordinary houses and warehouses can be used as storage rooms. The indoor temperature should generally be maintained above 3 degrees Celsius above zero. Place sleepers on the floor of the room for ventilation. The stacking should not exceed two layers, and they should be stored in a triangle shape. Do not move the baskets casually to avoid a large amount of grain falling off. Using this method of storage, the storage period can reach 150 to 180 days.

    怎样贮藏鲜葡萄？
    葡萄是水果中较娇嫩的品种，不易贮存。在葡萄收获季节过去以后，要想吃到价廉味美的鲜葡萄，是一件不容易的事。现在介绍一种设备简单的暖室贮藏办法，供大家参考。
    贮藏的品种以晚熟旱葡萄为宜。在寒露前后，葡萄下树，即挑选枝柄翠绿，颗粒饱满，成熟适度的装入能容六十到七十斤的小圆筐内（筐高一尺二寸，直径一尺二寸）。筐内衬纸二层，葡萄装入筐内后，在筐上盖纸二层，放在院内阴凉通风的地方。等到霜降后，气温降到零上三到四度时，移入屋内。
    普通的房屋和仓库都可以用来作贮藏室，室内温度一般应保持在摄氏零上三度以上，室内地下铺枕木以通风，堆垛不宜超过二层，存放成“品”字形。不要随便挪动筐子，以免大量脱粒。用这种办法贮藏，贮存期可达一百五十到一百八十天。
