    Glorious Victory, Heroic Epic:
    An Overview of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Eight Years of Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea
    On June 25, 1950, the U.S. instigated the Syngman Rhee clique to launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Subsequently, U.S. forces also joined the offensive. At the same time, the U.S. militarily occupied our country's Taiwan.

    The U.S. aggressors attempted to destroy Korea in one fell swoop and further invade our country as part of their ambitious plan to dominate the world. To realize this aggressive ambition, they were unwilling to accept the initial defeats suffered under the blows of the Korean People's Army. They gathered the superior military forces they and their vassal states could commit to the war, made a large-scale landing at Inchon, and expanded the war of aggression against Korea, causing the war situation to change to the serious disadvantage of the Korean People's Army. Disregarding the solemn warnings repeatedly issued by the Chinese people and the Chinese government regarding the withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from Taiwan, the rapid cessation of the war of aggression against Korea, and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, they brazenly crossed the 38th parallel, approached the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, and seriously threatened our country's security.

    The Chinese people could not tolerate such reckless acts of aggression. They rose up to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect their homes and defend their country, and formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPV), crossing the Yalu River to fight alongside the Korean people and the Korean People's Army against U.S. imperialist aggression.

    Five Battles and Five Victories Drive the Enemy Back to the 38th Parallel
    On October 25, 1950, the CPV fought its first battle after entering Korea. After twelve days and nights of fierce fighting, the CPV, together with the Korean People's Army, inflicted a devastating blow on the ROK 6th Division in the Unsan area on the western front, severely damaging the ROK 8th Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, driving the enemy south of the Chongchon River. On the eastern front, they shattered the ROK 3rd Division's offensive in the Hwangchoryong area, halting the advance of the U.S. 1st Marine Division. This campaign annihilated over 15,000 enemy troops, securing a victory in the initial engagement, and stabilizing the Korean war situation.

    After suffering its first heavy blow, the enemy still believed in its "air and sea superiority." Therefore, it concentrated its elite forces of 200,000 troops and launched a so-called "general offensive to end the Korean War by Christmas." Our army exploited the enemy's arrogance, luring them deep into predetermined areas. On November 25th, together with the Korean People's Army, they suddenly launched a powerful counterattack. The offensive on the western front was crushed, and the army took advantage of the victory to pursue and recapture Pyongyang, driving the enemy back to the 38th parallel. On the eastern front, a fierce attack was launched on the U.S. 1st Marine Division and the U.S. 7th Division in the Changjin Lake area. After suffering a crushing defeat, the enemy fled in disarray by sea. This battle lasted a month, annihilating over 36,000 enemy troops, severely undermining the enemy's arrogance, reversing the Korean war situation, boosting world morale, and supporting our representative's struggle at the UN Security Council meetings.

    After retreating to the 38th parallel, the enemy used existing fortifications to establish a defense line and engaged in a "ceasefire" conspiracy, attempting to buy time to reorganize its remaining forces and wait for an opportunity to stage a comeback. On New Year's Eve 1950, the main forces of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, taking advantage of the enemy's instability, launched a New Year Offensive, breaking through the enemy's defense line in one fell swoop, liberating Seoul, annihilating over 19,000 enemy troops, and pushing the battle line to the 37th parallel.

    The enemy, having suffered three blows, was thrown into chaos, with intense internal disputes. Our Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, further isolating U.S. imperialism. To salvage the situation and calm internal panic, the enemy launched a full-scale offensive against our forces on January 25, 1951. Initially, our CPV and the Korean People's Army engaged in heroic resistance along the south bank of the Han River and counterattacked the protruding enemy in the Hoengseong area. Subsequently, to massively deplete and annihilate the enemy's active forces, they ceased the counterattack, switched to mobile defense, fought bravely for eighty-eight days, during which the enemy advanced an average of less than one and a half kilometers per day, losing over 78,000 troops, and were finally stopped on the Kaesong-Ganseong line.

    To thwart the enemy's conspiracy to "establish a new defense line in the waist of Korea" (i.e., landing behind our lines on the Pyongyang-Wonsan line) and annihilate a large number of enemy forces, on April 22, 1951, our CPV, together with the Korean People's Army, launched the Spring Counteroffensive, i.e., the Fifth Campaign. Lasting over two stages for fifty days, a total of over 82,000 enemy troops were annihilated. During this campaign, the Chinese and Korean people's armies closely coordinated, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and created the brilliant achievement of annihilating the majority of two ROK divisions in the Gentry County area.

    During the advance of the Fifth Campaign, the CPV witnessed the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. invading forces: towns were reduced to ruins, people were displaced, forests were ablaze, and the bodies of Korean people murdered by the enemy were everywhere. Yet, the heroic Korean people remained steadfast and fought bravely. This tragic and magnificent scene aroused the CPV officers and soldiers' unparalleled hatred for the enemy. Hatred for the enemy, sympathy for friendly neighbors, and love for the motherland converged, further enhancing internationalist thought, recognizing the truth that protecting the homeland required resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and solidifying the determination to kill the enemy, inspiring a spirit of bravery and fearlessness. In battle, although there was a vast disparity between the enemy and our equipment, our army was unfamiliar with the terrain, did not speak the language, and had inadequate supplies, facing numerous difficulties. However, under the influence of internationalism and patriotism, the CPV commanders and fighters demonstrated a high degree of tenacity and optimism, and promoted a high degree of class friendship. Party members and cadres took the lead in overcoming difficulties. With unity from top to bottom, and sharing joys and sorrows, even with only a handful of roasted flour and snow, or even eating tree bark and wild vegetables, they remained full of spirit and fought bravely. Many heroic figures emerged, such as Yang Gensi, who charged into enemy ranks with explosives, perishing with the enemy to defend the position.

    The CPV lacked experience in its first confrontation with the modern U.S. invading forces. The Chinese Communist Party CPV Committee put forward the slogan of "learning warfare through warfare." The entire army launched an activity to uncover the enemy's "bottom." When the soldiers realized that the key to surrounding and annihilating the mechanized enemy was to cut off its transportation, they disregarded the cold and slippery conditions, braved enemy air raids, boldly penetrated, encircled, and directly entered the enemy's heartland, cutting off the enemy's retreat, disrupting the enemy's deployments, and fiercely annihilating the enemy forces. After the troops understood the enemy's weaknesses, such as a lack of aggressive attacks, insecure defenses, and fear of night and close combat, they more actively utilized the power of fierce attacks, resolute defenses, and night and close combat. The enemy's control of the air posed a great threat to our army's movements and operations, so the troops launched an anti-aircraft shooting campaign. As the vast number of commanders and fighters said, "The enemy fights with mechanization, we fight with ingenuity." Combining command principles with the wisdom of the masses, and turning command decisions into conscious actions of the masses, it became possible to skillfully defeat the enemy and further strengthen confidence in victory in the war.

    Through five campaigns, the Chinese and Korean forces annihilated over 220,000 enemy troops, driving the invaders back to the 38th parallel and restoring the democratic base in the northern half of Korea. This fundamentally changed the Korean War situation, forcing the enemy to shift from strategic offensive to strategic defense, and forcing them to accept the peaceful proposal put forward by the Soviet government on June 23, 1951, regarding negotiations for a ceasefire and armistice, and began negotiations with our side for a Korean armistice.

    Active Defense, Struggle for a Fair and Reasonable Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue
    The purpose of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was to oppose aggression, defend peace, and seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. After the Soviet government proposed negotiations for a ceasefire and armistice, the people and governments of China and Korea quickly responded and reiterated their proposal to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. Having suffered five blows from our side, the U.S. aggressors, although "seeing no hope of victory," were forced to negotiate with the Chinese and Korean sides but lacked any sincerity for peace. On the one hand, they engaged in political blackmail at the negotiating table, disrupting the negotiations; on the other hand, they sought opportunities to invade and exert so-called "military pressure" on the Chinese and Korean sides. As a result, a long-term stalemate of two years and one month emerged on the battlefield, unfolding a struggle intertwined with military and political aspects.

    After the negotiations began, the enemy used various despicable means to disrupt and interrupt the negotiations, and absurdly proposed establishing the military demarcation line in the area north of the 38th parallel, attempting to advance 12,000 square kilometers without firing a shot. This unreasonable demand was solemnly rejected by the Chinese and Korean sides, and the enemy even issued the arrogant cry of "Let the planes and cannons do the talking." On August 18, 1951, the enemy launched the so-called "limited summer offensive" against the Korean People's Army positions. The heroic People's Army fought bravely for a month, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and shattering the enemy's offensive. From then on, the enemy called the "851" highland defended by the People's Army "Heartbreak Ridge." After the enemy's defeat in the summer offensive, on September 29, they launched the so-called "autumn offensive" against the positions defended by the CPV, employing the so-called "steel tactics." Our army, relying on field fortifications, bravely resisted the enemy's dense artillery fire, fighting for every mountain and every inch of land. By October 22, our army had crushed the enemy's offensive. During this period, the Chinese and Korean armies annihilated a total of 250,000 enemy troops, forcing the enemy to sit down again for negotiations, abandoning its absurd demands, and accepting the Chinese and Korean proposal of "taking the actual contact line as the military demarcation line." After this, our army conducted tactical counterattacks and recovered the coastal islands in northern Korea.

    While launching the summer and autumn offensives against our front lines, the U.S. aggressors adopted the so-called "strangulation warfare" against our rear, starting from July 1951. They wantonly bombed and destroyed our rear railways and bridges, attempting to strangle our army's supply line, thereby undermining the stability of our army's defenses.

    To ensure victory in combat, the commanders and fighters on the logistics front and the railway workers, under the principle of "using key points against key points, using mobility against mobility," promoted a high degree of tenacious spirit and wisdom. Amidst flying shrapnel, in the sweltering heat and severe cold, facing rapids and icy water, they raced against time to repair the damaged railways, highways, and bridges, creating various methods of train operation. During the war, the enemy dropped an average of one bomb every seven meters on our railway lines, but our railway transport volume not only did not decrease but increased by nearly three times. On the highways, thanks to the heroic and intelligent repair and struggle of our engineering corps, anti-aircraft sentries, and heroic truck drivers, various vehicles still traveled day and night, truly forming an unbreakable, indestructible steel transportation line. Our young air force also came out to fight, bravely striking down air pirates. The so-called U.S. air ace Davis was also shot down by our air force. By this point, the enemy's air superiority was also shattered.

    In early 1952, the U.S. aggressors, violating international law, implemented a brutal bacteriological warfare. They spread a large number of bacteria in northern Korea, attempting to fundamentally weaken the combat effectiveness of the Chinese and Korean people's armies by severely destroying people, livestock, and crops. The Chinese and Korean armies and the Korean people mobilized urgently, launching a vigorous struggle against bacteriological warfare. Various units closely cooperated with the Korean government and people, forming a joint epidemic prevention committee, carrying out epidemic prevention and hygiene campaigns, capturing and killing bacteria-carrying insects, and eradicating rats and flies, victoriously crushing the enemy's bacteriological warfare. At the same time, our army obtained a large amount of conclusive evidence of the enemy's bacteriological warfare, conducting public exhibitions and inviting the International Scientific Commission and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to conduct on-site investigations, exposing the crimes of the U.S. aggressors to the world, causing U.S. imperialism to go completely bankrupt morally.

    When transitioning to the stage of active defense, the idea of protracted warfare had been grasped by the vast number of commanders and fighters. In 1951, during the crushing of the enemy's "autumn offensive," the masses created the prototype of tunnel fortifications. After timely summary and promotion by the leadership, it gradually developed and improved. On our positions, a defense system with tunnels as the backbone was formed—an unprecedented underground Great Wall. The "Underground Great Wall" ran for more than 250 kilometers near the 38th parallel on the Korean Peninsula. The project was extremely vast, equivalent to digging a stone tunnel from Xi'an to Lianyungang in our country. All the trenches connecting the tunnels were more than a hundred kilometers longer than the Great Wall of China. However, this vast project was almost entirely built manually with simple tools. While our army strengthened tunnel fortifications and consolidated positions, the enemy's air and artillery bombardment became more frequent. To change this situation, the vast number of commanders and fighters used their ingenuity, launched a sniper and cold-cannon killing campaign, mass small-unit activities in front of the enemy, and a large-scale mine relocation campaign, greatly reducing the enemy's arrogance and greatly reducing the power of artillery fire. In addition, our army widely conducted political propaganda offensives, and the enemy's morale became even more depressed. From December 1951 to August 1952, the Chinese and Korean armies annihilated more than 110,000 enemy troops.

    As our army's positions became increasingly stable, the enemy's "strangulation warfare" and bacteriological warfare were declared failures. Thanks to the donation campaigns launched by the people of the motherland and strong support, our army became stronger and stronger, not only effectively crushing the enemy's offensive but also being able to actively strike the enemy. On September 18, 1952, our army began a planned tactical counterattack across the entire front line, attacking sixty-seven enemy positions in forty-four days. After repeated contention, seventeen positions were consolidated and captured. More than 27,000 enemy troops were annihilated, and the battle line gradually moved south.

    The Korean armistice negotiations, which were of concern to people all over the world, after the enemy was forced to accept the Chinese and Korean proposals regarding the military demarcation line on November 27, 1951, the U.S. aggressors created a series of pretexts on other negotiation agenda items to obstruct and disrupt the armistice negotiations. After more than eight months of struggle, because the enemy was politically unjustified and militarily repeatedly defeated, on August 5, 1952, the staff members of both sides of the Korean armistice negotiations reached a complete agreement in substance on the textual details of the draft armistice agreement. At this point, all Korean armistice negotiations except the issue of prisoner repatriation had been agreed upon.

    In May 1952, in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, prisoners of war from the Chinese and Korean sides launched an incident of detaining Brigadier General Dodd, the commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, to fight for reasonable treatment and the right to return to their homeland. The series of heroic struggles of the prisoners of war from the Chinese and Korean sides in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps had already exposed the U.S. aggressors' so-called "voluntary repatriation" scam. However, in order to maintain the face of the leader of the imperialist camp, the U.S. aggressors still attempted to force the Chinese and Korean people to submit on the issue of prisoners of war. On October 8, 1952, the U.S. side openly announced an indefinite adjournment of the Korean armistice negotiations, interrupted the armistice negotiations, and launched a large-scale offensive against our Shangganling position on October 14, vainly attempting to seize Shangganling first, and then take Mount Osung, opening a gap in the center of our battle line, dividing our defense system, forcing us to retreat, and creating a favorable situation for negotiations.

    During the Battle of Shangganling, the invading army was extremely rampant. It mobilized more than 60,000 troops, more than 300 artillery pieces, more than 100 tanks, and more than 3,000 sorties of aircraft, pouring 1.9 million shells and more than 5,000 bombs onto our 3.7-square-kilometer position. As a result, the mountain tops of our positions were lowered by two meters, and many tunnels were shortened by five or six meters. Although the enemy used an unprecedentedly concentrated firepower in world military history, it could not break through our army's steel defense line. The troops of our army who resolutely defended the Shangganling position bravely resisted the enemy's offensive, and each surface position was repeatedly contested several times. During the repeated contention, the special-class hero Huang Jiguang emerged, blocking the enemy's gun muzzle with his body to open the way for the assault troops. The first-class hero and platoon leader Sun Zhanyuan emerged, who insisted on directing the battle to the last breath with his legs broken, pulled the last grenade and rolled towards the enemy, perishing with the enemy to consolidate the position. Many heroic figures and earth-shattering heroic and tragic deeds emerged. Some detachments, after the surface positions were occupied by the superior enemy, retreated to the tunnel fortifications, losing ground contact with the rear, and could not receive food, ammunition, or drinking water. They could not eat for several days and could not drink water. Many people's mouths and tongues were cracked, and they sucked the cool air from the mud on the stone walls to quench their thirst. At this time, the party members of several detachments formed a temporary party branch, which became the core leadership, uniting the masses, overcoming difficulties, and resolutely defending the tunnels. They also organized small detachments to actively attack the enemy every night, capturing and killing enemy sentries and destroying enemy bunkers that blocked the tunnels, preventing the enemy from approaching our tunnel entrances. Finally, they coordinated with our main force to counterattack and recover the positions.

    During the campaign, our valiant artillery closely cooperated with the infantry, fiercely bombarding the enemy army, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy; the logistics troops, braving the enemy's artillery blockade, moved forward one after another to transport food and ammunition to support the troops defending the positions. In this way, after forty-three days of continuous fierce fighting, the offensive personally commanded by Van Fleet, the commander of the enemy's Eighth Army, which the enemy boasted so much about, was finally completely crushed by our army. The enemy was annihilated more than 25,000 people, and our position remained unmoved.

    The victory of the Battle of Shangganling proved that our army could attack and defend and that our army's front was incomparably solid.

    Powerful Summer Offensive Operations Force the Enemy to Sign the Armistice Agreement
    After the enemy suffered a disastrous defeat in Shangganling, the idea of breaking the stalemate through a frontal offensive completely failed. On January 20, 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower succeeded Harry S. Truman as President of the United States and, upon taking office, advocated preparedness and aggressive policies, and planned to expand the Korean War by landing behind our army’s lines. The Chinese and Korean people saw through the enemy's attempt, and the CPV, the People's Army, and the Korean people conducted an unprecedented large-scale war mobilization, and launched a vast project to build solid positions on the east and west coasts, repair roads, store materials, and prepare to meet any scale of war from the enemy. Because our army was fully prepared and stood ready, the enemy's conspiracy to land behind our lines was thwarted without a fight, and our army's rear was unprecedentedly consolidated. In April 1953, thanks to our side's firm efforts, the armistice negotiations reached an agreement on the exchange of wounded and sick prisoners of war, and comprehensive negotiations resumed on April 26.

    In order to promote the realization of the armistice, our army launched summer offensive operations that were larger and larger in scale, giving the enemy three consecutive blows since May 13. In the first campaign, the target of each battle did not exceed the enemy's battalion position, with twenty-nine battles in total, annihilating more than 40,000 enemy troops. The second campaign was a battle on the south bank of the Han River, which was larger in scale, breaking through the enemy's whole battalion and whole regiment positions. When an agreement was reached on the issue of prisoner repatriation and specific arrangements were made for the signing of the armistice, the Syngman Rhee clique, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, forcibly detained 27,000 prisoners of war from our side. In order to strike at the enemy's reactionary arrogance, our army inflicted a third blow on the enemy south of Kimhwa. With powerful field troops and powerful artillery support, we launched an offensive against the 22-kilometer-wide and 5-kilometer-deep positions held by the enemy's four divisions. In just one hour of combat, we broke through the entire front, and the enemy was completely defeated in one day and night. The entire summer offensive campaign annihilated more than 120,000 enemy troops and expanded the position by more than 240 square kilometers.

    Before this campaign, the troops extensively carried out military democracy, mobilizing all commanders and fighters to raise difficulties, come up with solutions, repeatedly examine the terrain, set up sand tables, study the tactics of attacking the enemy's solid positions, and conduct field exercises. Therefore, many unique and wonderful tactics were created. In order to reduce casualties during the attack, a certain unit even broke through military conventions and ambushed more than 3,000 assault troops in front of the enemy's position for a day and night without anyone exposing the target. When the charge was launched, it was as if divine soldiers had descended from the sky, catching the enemy off guard. The enemy's position had tunnels and strong firepower, and our army commanders and fighters also studied a set of tactics to smash it to pieces. During the offensive campaign, our army troops made even greater use of the tactics of bold penetration and deep insertion into the enemy's formation. A certain regiment's vanguard reconnaissance squad, disguised in a surprise attack, penetrated more than twenty miles into the enemy's formation, directly attacking the regimental headquarters of the ROK "White Tiger Regiment," annihilating the enemy's command organs, disrupting the enemy's command, and creating favorable conditions for the attacking troops.

    After suffering a heavy blow from our side, the enemy became even more panicked and hurried to urge the signing of the armistice agreement while our offensive operations were still in progress. As a result, the Korean armistice, which was of concern to the world, was finally realized on July 27, 1953.

    Struggle to Maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement
    After the Korean armistice was realized, the international situation tended to ease. However, the U.S. ruling group continued to do everything possible to undermine the armistice agreement and create a tense situation in Korea and the Far East. On August 8, 1953, the twelfth day after the signing of the armistice agreement, the United States signed an aggressive "Common Defense Treaty" with the Syngman Rhee clique. Subsequently, they forcibly detained a large number of prisoners of war from the Chinese and Korean sides, and on January 20 and 21, 1954, they forcibly hijacked more than 21,000 prisoners of war from the Chinese and Korean sides. On December 12, the U.S. side blatantly rejected the proposal to convene a political conference to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. In May 1956, they forcibly withdrew the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from South Korea. In June 1957, they unilaterally announced the abandonment of thirteen provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the prohibition of the introduction of reinforcing weapons into Korea, and shipped atomic and rocket weapons into South Korea, reorganizing the U.S. forces in South Korea into five group-based atomic divisions. Therefore, after the armistice, the CPV shouldered the task of maintaining the armistice agreement alongside the Korean People's Army, assisting Korea in its reconstruction, and conducting training.

    The people's armies of China and Korea strictly abided by the armistice agreement. At the same time, in order to maintain the armistice agreement, our army commanders and fighters were always vigilant, strictly guarding their positions, closely watching the enemy's every move, and promptly exposing their conspiracies. The Chinese and Korean representatives in the Military Armistice Commission constantly issued solemn warnings and protests to the enemy regarding the enemy's violations of the armistice agreement, exposing their shameful faces, and striking at their aggressive plans. At the same time, our army actively built and consolidated fortifications, and conducted military, political, and cultural training intensively to improve the troops' combat capabilities and prepare for possible sudden incidents.

    The civilian police force in the Demilitarized Zone steadfastly guarded the military demarcation line, day and night. They patrolled in the storms and monitored the enemy in the heavy snow, solemnly maintaining the armistice agreement and keenly capturing the enemy's dispatched agents. After the armistice, up to June 26, 1958, the enemy had carried out 792 provocations in the Demilitarized Zone or through the Demilitarized Zone in violation of the armistice agreement. Because the Chinese and Korean People's Armies maintained a high degree of vigilance and stood ready, the enemy's sabotage conspiracies were all defeated by us one by one. Although the enemy denied these espionage activities in every possible way, the U.S. side was in a very embarrassing situation in the face of numerous investigations by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and inspection teams of the Military Armistice Commission, with human and material evidence.

    The CPV actively supported the consistent propositions of the Chinese and Korean governments for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of the tense situation in the Far East. From September 1954 to October 1955, the CPV withdrew nineteen divisions from Korea in three batches, making great efforts for the cause of peace.

    Actively Participate in the Restoration and Reconstruction of Northern Korea
    From the day the CPV entered Korea, it followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "cherish every mountain, every river, every tree, and every blade of grass in Korea," respecting the Korean government and uniting with the Korean people with lofty internationalist ideals, and rescuing and providing disaster relief, rescuing the lives of the Korean people. Internationalist warriors such as Luo Shengjiao emerged. In the gaps between battles, we did everything possible to help the Korean people with production and labor. After the war, the CPV commanders and fighters saw that the cities and villages of northern Korea were severely damaged by the U.S. aggressors, and realized that the reconstruction and restoration of every factory and village in northern Korea was a force for the joint defense of the socialist camp against imperialist aggression. Therefore, as soon as the flames of war stopped, they participated in the work of restoring and rebuilding the northern half of Korea with the same enthusiasm as building the motherland, according to the instructions of the CPV Party Committee. The railway soldiers worked together with the Korean people to repair the original railways in the northern half of Korea within three months after the armistice, and built and repaired more than 1,300 large and small bridges. The engineering corps was involved in the reconstruction projects of hero cities such as Pyongyang, Hamhung, and Wonsan. In Pyongyang alone, more than 200,000 square meters of various buildings such as the Cabinet Comprehensive Office Building, hospitals, and universities were built. They put forward the slogan of "building Pyongyang with the same effort as building the capital of the motherland, Beijing," overcoming many technical difficulties and saving a lot of materials.

    Various units participated in the restoration and reconstruction work. When Korean people who had lost their homes returned to their hometowns near the front line, the soldiers helped to build houses, repair schools, fill in the countless bomb craters in the fields, and remove the mines and explosives buried by the enemy, so that the Korean people could live and produce in peace.

    During the war, the evil U.S. imperialism destroyed many water conservancy projects in Korea, and the CPV assisted the Korean people in repairing them with millions of laborers. By the end of 1957, eight reservoirs, including "Gyeonryong" and "Taechon," had been repaired, more than 1,300 dikes and dams had been built, with a total length of 627 li, and seven rivers such as the Namcheon River had been harnessed, with a length of 22 li. In 1958, the CPV also participated in the construction of reservoir projects such as Jeongju and Goksan. During these projects, the CPV commanders and fighters displayed unparalleled enthusiasm for labor, sometimes fighting against floods and sometimes working in icy water. Some soldiers sacrificed their lives while assisting in the socialist construction of Korea.

    The Korean people suffered severe destruction from the enemy during the war, and were also severely affected by serious floods and droughts in 1954, making life very difficult for a time. The CPV commanders and fighters tightened their belts and saved more than 7 million catties of grain and more than 100,000 pieces of clothing and supplies, donating them to the Korean people to help them overcome the famine. In 1956, the commanders and fighters automatically raised funds to purchase 500 double-wheel double-blade plows and donated them to Korean agricultural cooperatives. In addition, the CPV also spared training time to help the Korean people with agricultural labor such as plowing, harvesting, reclaiming wasteland, and planting trees, and domestic labor such as draining water, collecting firewood, and repairing houses.

    All this labor embodies internationalist thought, further enhances the friendship between China and Korea, and also educates the vast number of officers and soldiers in the troops, enhancing their ideological awareness.

    The CPV commanders and fighters are always concerned about the socialist construction of the motherland. Every construction achievement of the motherland encourages the CPV to forge ahead. After the armistice, in order to support the socialist construction of the motherland, the CPV launched a large-scale production and conservation movement. The task of self-sufficiency in vegetables for five months and meat for two months was realized soon after the armistice. The troops universally used the gaps beside villages and barracks to reclaim wasteland for growing vegetables and raising pigs and sheep. At the same time, they practiced thrift and cherished every drop of gasoline and every grain of grain supplied by the motherland, saving more than 10 million catties of grain in 1956 and 1957 alone. In addition, the entire army actively purchased public bonds, exceeding the predetermined targets every year. During the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in our country in 1955, the CPV launched a donation campaign, and in a very short time automatically donated funds to purchase fifty tractors, built a CPV tractor station, and dedicated it to the people of the motherland. These actions of the CPV to produce and save and actively support the socialist construction of the motherland have been warmly praised by the people of the whole country.

    Return Home Full of Victory and Friendship
    As the socialist forces surpassed the imperialist forces, and the forces of peace surpassed the forces of war, a new turning point emerged in the international situation where the East wind prevailed over the West wind, and there was a greater possibility of peacefully resolving major international issues. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed on February 5, 1958, various proposals for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea. In order to break the deadlock in the peaceful resolution of the issue of Korean reunification and ease the tense situation in the Far East created by U.S. imperialism, our government, after consultation with the Korean government, proposed to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to take the initiative to withdraw all of its troops from Korea. All CPV commanders and fighters warmly agreed with our government's proposal and decided to withdraw all of its troops from Korea in three batches before the end of 1958. On February 19, 1958, the governments of China and Korea jointly issued a statement announcing this decision of the CPV. The CPV began withdrawing its troops from Korea on March 15, 1958, amid the cheers of the Korean people, and all of its troops returned to the motherland by the end of October. The efforts made by the CPV to seek peace have not only opened up new realistic avenues for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also demonstrated the strength of the socialist camp. The CPV's initiative to withdraw from Korea has been universally praised by peace-loving people all over the world. The U.S. imperialist invading army, which launched the war of aggression against Korea and obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea, is still entrenched in South Korea and is being condemned by the people of the world, becoming even more isolated.

    During the process of the CPV's withdrawal from Korea, the combat friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, cemented with blood, was further consolidated and developed. The vast number of CPV commanders and fighters, in accordance with the CPV Party Committee's policy of "not being arrogant or complacent, doing a good job from beginning to end, withdrawing the troops, and maintaining friendship forever," responded to the call to do a "three good" job of withdrawing troops (handover well, leave well, arrive well) and launched a new upsurge in enhancing unity and friendship. According to the needs of the masses, various units, regardless of fatigue, helped the Korean people to repair canals, dams, houses, plant trees, and other work day and night... Many units proposed "sweating more and leaving more friendship," and some did not stop working until the eve of their departure. Under the situation of withdrawing troops in batches, the labor plans for assisting the Korean people in labor have been broken through again and again, reaching more than 1.54 million man-days from the announcement of the withdrawal of troops to the completion of the withdrawal.

    While transferring defense responsibilities to the People's Army, the CPV completely and gratuitously transferred barracks, camp equipment, a large number of materials and equipment, and the complete equipment of the hospital to the People's Army. All units donated the pigs, sheep, vegetables, and homemade production tools raised by the food units to the People's Army units that took over the defense. Before the handover, the commanders and fighters repaired fortifications, cleaned tunnels and trenches, whitewashed barracks, beautified the environment, decorated clubs, and added utensils. Everything was repaired neatly and carefully, with deep intentions. When the People's Army took over the defense, the troops lined up to welcome them, treating the People's Army comrades like relatives and carefully explaining the defense responsibilities. The vast number of commanders and fighters took out their most beloved gifts and gave them to the People's Army comrades as souvenirs. A strong bond of deep affection permeated between the close comrades-in-arms of the two armies.

    When the CPV returned to China, it received enthusiastic help and support from the Korean government and people. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a special decision

    光辉的胜利　英雄的史诗
    中国人民志愿军抗美援朝八年概述
    1950年6月25日，美国唆使李承晚集团发动了向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的进攻，接着美国军队也参加了这一进攻。与此同时，美国武装侵占了我国台湾。
    美国侵略者妄图一举灭亡朝鲜，并进一步侵犯我国，作为它们称霸全世界野心计划的一部分。为了实现这一侵略野心，它们不甘心最初在朝鲜人民军打击下所遭受的失败，竟纠集他们自己和仆从国家可以投入战争的优势兵力，在仁川大举登陆，扩大侵朝战争，使战争形势发生了对朝鲜人民军严重不利的变化。他们并且不顾中国人民和中国政府一再提出的关于美国武装力量退出台湾，迅速停止侵朝战争，和平解决朝鲜问题的严正警告，悍然越过三八线，逼近鸭绿江和图们江，严重威胁了我国安全。
    中国人民不能容忍这样肆无忌惮的侵略行为，纷纷起来抗美援朝，保家卫国，并组成了中国人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民和人民军一道，抗击美帝国主义侵略。
    五战五捷把敌人赶回三八线
    1950年10月25日，志愿军打响出国第一仗。经过十二昼夜激战，志愿军同朝鲜人民军一道在西线云山地区予李伪军第六师以歼灭性打击，予李伪军第八师、美军骑兵第一师以严重打击，将敌人驱逐至清川江以南，并在东线黄草岭一带粉碎了李伪军第三师的进攻，阻止了美海军陆战队第一师的前进。这一战役，歼灭敌人一万五千余人，取得序战胜利，稳定了朝鲜战局。
    敌人遭我第一次沉重打击后，仍迷信其“空海优势”。因此，又集中其精锐兵力二十万人，发动了所谓“圣诞节结束朝鲜战争的总攻势”。我军利用了敌人的骄狂心理，诱敌深入到预定地点后，于11月25日和朝鲜人民军一起突然展开强大的战役反击。西线粉碎了敌人的进攻，并乘胜追击，收复平壤，把敌人赶回三八线；东线在长津湖地区向美海军陆战队第一师、美军第七师发起猛攻。敌遭我痛歼以后，由海上狼狈逃窜。这一仗，历时一个月，歼敌三万六千余人，沉重打击了敌人嚣张气焰，扭转了朝鲜战局，振奋了世界人心，配合了我国代表在联大安理会会议上的斗争。
    敌人退到三八线，利用原有工事建立防线，并玩弄“停火”阴谋，企图争取时间整顿残部，待机卷土重来。1950年除夕，中朝人民部队主力乘敌人立脚未稳，发起新年攻势，一举突破敌人防线，解放汉城，歼敌一万九千余人，将战线推至三十七度线。
    遭我三次打击的敌人慌作一团，内部争吵激烈。我国周恩来总理又重申和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，使美帝国主义更陷于孤立。敌人为挽救败局，镇定它内部的恐慌情绪，于1951年1月25日全线向我发起进攻。开初，我志愿军和朝鲜人民军在汉江南岸展开英勇阻击，并在横城地区对突出之敌进行反击。随后，为了大量消耗和歼灭敌人有生力量，便停止反击，转为机动防御，奋战八十八天，敌人每天平均爬进了不到一公里半，却损兵七万八千余人，最后被我阻止在开城——杆城一线。
    为了粉碎敌人“在朝鲜蜂腰部建立新防线”
  （即在我侧后平壤至元山一线登陆）的阴谋，大量歼灭敌人，1951年4月22日，我志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起发起了春季反击作战，即第五次战役。历经两个阶段五十余天，共歼敌八万二千余人。此次战役中朝中人民军队密切协同，并肩作战，创造了在县里地区歼灭李伪军两个师大部的辉煌战绩。
    志愿军在五次战役的进军途中，目睹美国侵略军所犯下的滔天罪行：城镇夷为废墟，人民流离失所，山林是一片火光，到处是被敌人杀害的朝鲜人民的尸体，而英雄的朝鲜人民却坚贞不屈，英勇斗争。这幅悲惨壮烈的情景，引起志愿军官兵对敌人的无比仇恨。仇恨敌人，同情友邻，热爱祖国三者汇流一起，更加提高了国际主义思想，认清了保家卫国必须抗美援朝的真理，坚定了杀敌决心，激发了英勇无畏的精神。在战斗中，虽然敌我装备优劣悬殊，我军地形不熟，语言不通，供应不及，困难极多。但是，志愿军指战员在国际主义与爱国主义思想支配下，表现了高度的顽强、乐观精神，发扬了高度的阶级友爱。党员、干部抢先带头，克服困难。上下一心、同甘共苦。虽然一把炒面一把雪，甚至吃树皮野菜，仍精神饱满，奋力战斗，并出现了抱炸药包冲向敌群与敌同归于尽而保卫了阵地的杨根思等许多英雄人物。
    志愿军初次和现代化的美国侵略军交锋，缺乏经验。中国共产党志愿军委员会提出了
  “从战争中学习战争”的口号。全军展开摸敌人“底”的活动。当战士认识到对机械化的敌军，不切断它的交通无法包围聚歼的特点，便不顾天寒地滑，不畏敌机袭扰，大胆穿插，迂回包围，直入敌军心脏，断敌退路，打乱敌人布置，痛歼敌军。当部队摸透敌军攻不猛、守不坚、怕夜战近战等弱点之后，更加积极发挥猛打坚守，夜战近战的威力。敌军掌握制空权，对我军行动、作战极大威胁，部队即展开了对空射击运动。正如广大指战员所说“敌人打机械化，我们打巧妙化”。指挥原则与群众智慧结合起来，指挥决心化为群众自觉行动，就能巧妙地战胜敌人，并且在战争中益发坚定了必胜信心。
    经过五个战役，朝中部队共歼敌二十二万多人，把侵略者赶回到三八线，恢复了朝鲜北半部民主基地。从而根本改变了朝鲜战争形势，迫使敌人由战略进攻转入战略防御，并被迫接受了苏联政府1951年6月23日所提出的关于谈判停火与休战的和平建议，与我方开始了朝鲜停战的谈判。
    积极防御，为公平合理地和平解决朝鲜问题而斗争
    中国人民志愿军进行抗美援朝战争目的的，是为了反对侵略、保卫和平，求得朝鲜问题在公平合理的基础上获得和平解决。苏联政府提出关于谈判停火与休战的建议以后，朝中两国人民和政府迅速响应，并重申了以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的主张。美国侵略者经我五次打击，虽在“看不到胜利的希望”的情况下，被迫与朝中方面谈判，但毫无和平诚意。他们一方面在谈判桌上进行政治讹诈，破坏谈判的进行；一方面又伺机进犯，对朝中方面施加所谓“军事压力”。由此，战场上出现了长达两年零一个月的长期对峙，展开了军事与政治相交织的斗争。
    谈判开始后，敌人即以各种卑鄙手段，破坏和中断谈判，并极其荒谬地提出，将军事分界线建立在三八线以北地区内，企图不打一枪，向前推进一万二千平方公里。这一无理要求遭朝中方面严正拒绝后，竟然发出“让飞机大炮去辩论吧”的狂妄叫嚣。1951年8月18日，敌人向朝鲜人民军阵地发动了所谓“有限度的夏季攻势”。英勇的人民军，奋战一个月，给敌人以沉重杀伤，粉碎了敌人攻势。从此，敌人把人民军驻守的“八五一”高地称为“伤心岭”，敌人在夏季攻势挫败以后，9月29日又向志愿军坚守的阵地发动了所谓“秋季攻势”。施展所谓“钢铁战术”。我军依托野战工事，在敌人浓密炮火下，英勇抗击，逐山争夺，寸土必争。到10月22日，我军粉碎了敌人的进攻。在这时期，中朝军队共歼敌二十五万人，迫使敌人重新坐下来谈判，放弃了它荒谬的要求，接受了朝中方面提出的“以实际接触线为军事分界线”的方案。此后，我军进行战术性反击，并收复了朝鲜北部沿海岛屿。
    美国侵略者在向我们前线发动夏秋攻势同时，从1951年7月起，对我后方采取了所谓“绞杀战”。大肆轰炸破坏我后方铁路、桥梁，企图扼杀我军补给线从而破坏我军的防御稳定性。
    为了保证作战胜利，后勤战线上的指战员和铁路员工在“以重点对重点，以机动对机动”的方针下，发扬了高度的顽强精神和智慧。在弹片横飞中，在盛暑和严寒中，迎着激流和冰水，日夜抢修被破坏的铁路公路桥梁，创造了多种列车运行方法。战争期间，敌人向我铁路线平均每七公尺投下一枚炸弹，但我铁路运输量不仅没有减少，反而增多了近三倍。在公路线上由于我工程兵、防空哨和英雄的汽车驾驶员英勇机智的维修与斗争，各种车辆仍然日夜行驶，真正构成打不断、炸不烂的钢铁运输线。我年轻的空军部队也出而参战，英勇打击空中强盗。美军的所谓空中王牌戴维斯也被我空军击落。至此，敌人空中优势也被粉碎。
    1952年初，美国侵略者又违背国际公法，施行了灭绝人性的细菌战。他们向朝鲜北部大量撒布细菌，企图通过对人、畜、农作物的严重摧毁，从根本上削弱朝中人民军队的战斗力。朝中军队和朝鲜人民一道，紧急动员，展开了轰轰烈烈的反细菌战的斗争。各部队和朝鲜政府、人民密切合作，组成联合防疫委员会，开展防疫卫生运动，捕打带菌毒虫，灭鼠灭蝇，胜利地粉碎了敌人的细菌战。同时，我军掌握了大量敌人进行细菌战的确凿证据，进行公开展览，并邀请国际科学委员会、国际民主法律工作者协会进行实地调查，向全世界揭露了美国侵略者的罪行，使美帝国主义在道义上彻底破产。
    在转入积极防御阶段时，持久作战的思想已为广大指战员所掌握。1951年在粉碎敌人的
  “秋季攻势”中，群众创造了坑道工事的雏型。经过领导及时总结、推广，逐渐发展完善。在我方阵地上，形成了以坑道为骨干的防御体系——史无前例的地下长城。“地下长城”横贯朝鲜半岛三八线附近二百五十余公里。工程极为浩大，相当于从我国西安到连云港挖通一条石质隧道。连接坑道的全部战壕比万里长城还长百多公里。但这一浩大工程，却几乎全部是以人工用简陋工具修筑成的。在我军加强坑道工事、巩固阵地同时，敌人的空、炮轰击更加频繁。为改变这种情况，广大指战员发挥智慧，展开了冷枪冷炮杀敌运动，群众性的敌前小分队活动和地雷大搬家活动，打得敌人嚣张气焰大杀，炮火威力大减。再加我军广泛进行政治宣传攻势，敌军士气更加消沉低落。自1951年12月到1952年8月，朝中军队共歼灭敌人十一万人以上。
    由于我军阵地日益稳固，敌人的“绞杀战”、细菌战都宣告失败。由于祖国人民展开捐献运动，大力支援，我军愈战愈强，不仅有力地粉碎敌人的进攻，而且可以主动打击敌人。1952年9月18日，我军全线开始了有计划的战术反击，历时四十四天进攻敌阵地六十七处，经反复争夺，巩固夺取阵地十七处。歼敌二万七千余人，战线逐渐向南推移。
    全世界人民所关心的朝鲜停战谈判，自1951年11月27日，敌人被迫接受朝中方面关于军事分界线的提议以后，美国侵略者又在其他谈判议程上制造了一系列的借口，阻挠和破坏停战谈判。又经过八个多月的斗争。由于敌人在政治上理屈辞穷，在军事上屡遭失败，于是，在1952年8月5日，朝鲜停战谈判双方参谋人员，对于停战协定草案的文字细节在实质上取得全部协议。至此，朝鲜停战谈判除遣俘问题外，已全部达成协议。
    1952年5月，在巨济岛美方战俘营中，朝中方面被俘人员为争取合理待遇和重返祖国的权利，爆发了扣留美方战俘营长官杜德准将的事件。朝中被俘人员在美方战俘营中一系列的英勇斗争早已揭穿了美国侵略者所谓“自愿遣返”的骗局。但是美国侵略者为了维持帝国主义阵营盟主的面子，仍然企图在战俘问题上逼迫朝中人民屈服。1952年10月8日，美方公然宣布朝鲜停战谈判无限期休会，中断了停战谈判，并在10月14日向我上甘岭阵地发动了大规模进攻，妄想先夺取上甘岭，以后拿下五圣山，在我战线中央打开一个缺口，分割我防御体系，逼我后退，造成谈判有利形势。
    上甘岭战役中，侵略军十分猖狂。它调集兵力六万以上，大炮三百余门，坦克百多辆，出动飞机三千多架次，向我三点七平方公里阵地上，倾泻了炮弹一百九十万发，炸弹五千余颗。以致我方阵地山头被削低两公尺，许多坑道被打短了五、六公尺。虽然敌人使用了世界军事史上空前集中的炮火，但打不破我军的钢铁防线。我坚守上甘岭阵地的部队英勇抗击敌人的进攻，每一表面阵地都反复争夺数次。反复争夺中，出现了以身体堵塞敌人枪眼、为冲击部队打开道路的特级英雄黄继光，出现了双腿被打断仍坚持指挥到最后一口气，拉响最后一颗手榴弹滚向敌群，与敌同归于尽，巩固了阵地的一级英雄、排长孙占元。涌现了许许多多英雄人物和惊天动地的英勇壮烈事迹。有些分队在优势敌人占领表面阵地后，退守坑道工事，与后方失去地面联系，粮弹、饮水得不到接济，几天吃不到饭，喝不到水，许多人嘴舌崩裂，吸石壁泥土的凉气解渴。这时，几个分队的党员组成临时党支部，成为核心领导，团结群众，克服困难坚守坑道，并且还组织小分队每夜主动出击敌人，捕杀敌人哨兵，炸毁敌封锁坑道的碉堡，使敌人不敢接近我坑道口，最后，配合我主力部队反击，收复了阵地。
    战役中，我神勇炮兵密切协同步兵，猛轰敌军，给敌大量杀伤；后勤部队冒着敌人炮火封锁，前仆后继地运送粮弹，支援坚守阵地的部队。这样，持续鏖战四十三天，敌人大肆吹嘘的由敌第八集团军军长范佛里特亲自指挥的攻势，终于被我军彻底粉碎。敌被歼二万五千多人，而我阵地屹然未动。
    上甘岭战役的胜利，证明了我军能攻能守，证明了我军战线无比巩固。
    强大的夏季进攻作战，迫使敌人在停战协定上签字
    敌人在上甘岭惨败之后，从正面进攻以打破对峙局面的想法完全破产。1953年1月20日艾森豪威尔接替杜鲁门任美国总统，一上台就鼓吹备战和侵略政策，并计划从我军侧后方登陆扩大朝鲜战争。朝中人民识破敌人企图，志愿军、人民军和朝鲜人民进行了空前规模的战争动员，并在东西海岸展开了构筑坚固阵地的浩大工程，增修道路，储备物资，准备迎击敌人任何规模的战争。由于我军有了充分准备，严阵以待，敌人在我侧后登陆阴谋不打自破，我军后方空前巩固。1953年4月间，由于我方坚定努力，停战谈判对交换伤、病俘问题达成协议，全面谈判也于4月26日恢复。
    为了促成停战实现，我军发动了一次比一次规模强大的夏季进攻作战，自5月13日起，连续给敌以三次打击。第一次每个战斗的目标不超过敌人一个营阵地，战斗二十九次，共歼敌四万多人。第二次为汉江南岸作战，规模大了，突破敌人整营整团阵地。当遣俘问题达成协议，停战签字作具体安排的时候，李承晚集团竟然在美帝国主义策动下，强迫扣留我方二万七千名战俘。我军为了打击敌人的反动气焰，在金城以南予敌人第三次打击。我以强大野战部队，在强大的炮火支援下，向敌人四个师据守的宽二十二公里、纵深五公里的阵地发起进攻。仅仅一个小时战斗，就全线突破，一昼夜之间将敌人全部打垮。整个夏季进攻战役共歼灭敌人十二万余人，扩展阵地二百四十多平方公里。
    此次战役前，部队广泛开展了军事民主，发动全体指战员提困难、想办法，反复看地势、摆沙盘，研究进攻敌人坚固阵地的战法，并进行实地演习。因此，创造出很多独特奇妙的战法来。某部为减少攻击时的伤亡，竟突破军事上的惯例，将突击部队三千多人，潜伏在敌人阵地前一昼夜，没有一个人暴露目标，等发起冲锋时犹如神兵天降，打得敌人措手不及。敌人阵地筑有坑道，并有很强火力，我军指战员也研究出一套打法，把它打得粉碎。攻击战役中，我军部队更发挥了大胆穿插，深入敌阵的战法。某团一个先头侦察班，化装奇袭，深入敌阵二十多华里，直捣李伪军“白老虎团”团部，歼敌指挥机关，打乱敌人指挥，给攻击部队创造了有利条件。
    敌人遭我沉重打击之后，更加张慌失措，我进攻作战还在进行中，就急忙催促在停战协定上签字。于是，举世关怀的朝鲜停战终于在1953年7月27日实现了。
    为维护朝鲜停战协定而斗争
    朝鲜停战实现后，国际局势趋向和缓。但美国统治集团却继续千方百计地破坏停战协定，制造朝鲜、远东紧张局势。停战协定签订后的第十二天即1953年8月8日，美国就同李承晚集团签订了侵略性的“共同防御条约”。接着他们又强迫扣留大批朝中方面的战俘，1954年1月20、21日更用武力劫走朝中方面战俘二万一千多名。12月12日美方悍然拒绝了召开政治会议协商撤出一切外国军队和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。1956年5月强迫中立国视察小组撤出南朝鲜。1957年6月，又片面宣布废弃停战协定十三项卯款关于不得以增援性武器运入朝鲜的规定，并且向南朝鲜运进原子和火箭武器，将在南朝鲜的美军改编为五群制原子师。因此，志愿军在停战后就担负起与朝鲜人民军并肩维护停战协定，协助朝鲜进行恢复建设，和进行训练的任务。
    朝中两国人民军队，严格遵守停战协定，同时，为维护停战协定，我军指战员时刻警惕地严守自己阵地，密切注视着敌人一举一动，及时揭发其阴谋活动。在军事停战委员会内的朝中代表，不断就敌人破坏停战协定事件，向敌人提出严正警告和抗议，揭露其可耻面目，打击其侵略计划。同时，我军积极修筑加固工事，紧张地进行军事、政治和文化训练，以提高部队作战能力，准备应付可能发生的突然事变。
    在非军事区的民警部队，坚守在军事分界线上，不分白昼黑夜，他们在暴风雨里进行巡逻，在大雪中监视敌人，庄严地维护了停战协定，机警地捕捉了敌人派遣来的特务。停战后，到1958年6月26日为止，敌人在非军事区或通过非军事区违反停战协定的挑衅活动达七百九十二起，由于中朝人民军队保持高度警惕，严阵以待，敌人的破坏阴谋都一一被我击破。尽管敌人对这些特务活动多方抵赖，但是通过军事停战委员会中立国监察委员会及视察小组的多次调查，在人证物证面前美方处于十分狼狈境地。
    志愿军积极拥护朝中两国政府和平解决朝鲜问题和和缓远东紧张局势的一贯主张，1954年9月至1955年10月，志愿军先后分三批从朝鲜撤出了十九个师，为和平事业作出巨大努力。
    积极参加朝鲜北部的恢复建设
    志愿军从进入朝鲜一天起，就遵循着毛主席“爱护朝鲜一山一水一草一木”的指示，以崇高国际主义思想，尊重朝鲜政府，团结朝鲜人民，并且抢险救灾，抢救朝鲜人民生命，出现了罗盛教那样国际主义战士。在战斗空隙中，尽一切力量帮助朝鲜人民生产劳动。战后，志愿军指战员看到朝鲜北部城市和乡村被美国侵略者严重破坏，认识到朝鲜北部每一工厂、村庄的重建和恢复，对社会主义阵营来说都是共同防御帝国主义侵略的力量增强。因此，战争炮火刚一停下，就按照志愿军党委的指示，以建设祖国般的热情，参加到恢复重建朝鲜北半部的工作中去。铁道兵部队与朝鲜人民共同努力，在停战三个月后，就修复了朝鲜北半部的原有铁路，并且新建和修复了大小桥梁一千三百余座。工程兵部队投入平壤、咸兴、元山等英雄城市的重建工程。仅在平壤一地就修建了内阁综合办公厅、医院、大学等各种建筑二十多万平方公尺。他们提出“以建设祖国首都北京的劲头建设平壤”的口号，克服了许多技术困难，节约了大量物资。
    各部队参加了恢复建设工作。在前线附近，丧失家园的朝鲜人民回乡时，战士们协助盖房屋、修学校，填平田中的无数炸弹坑，起去敌人埋下的地雷爆炸物，使朝鲜人民安居生产。
    在战争中，万恶的美帝国主义炸毁了朝鲜许多水利工程，志愿军则以千百万劳动力协助朝鲜人民进行了修复。到1957年底止，先后修复了“见龙”“泰川”等八座水库，修筑堤坝一千三百余条，全长六百二十七华里，修治了南川江等河道七条，长二十二华里。1958年志愿军又参加了修建定州、谷山等水库工程。在这些工程中，志愿军指战员发挥无比的劳动热情，有时与洪水搏斗，有时在冰水中施工。有的战士在协助朝鲜社会主义建设中献出了生命。
    朝鲜人民在战争中遭受敌人严重摧残，加上1954年又受到严重的水旱灾害，生活一度很困难。志愿军指战员节衣缩食，节省出粮食七百多万斤，衣物、用品十万多件捐赠给朝鲜人民，帮助朝鲜人民渡过灾荒。1956年指战员又自动集资购买双轮双铧犁五百部，捐赠给朝鲜农业合作社。此外，志愿军还抽出训练时间帮助朝鲜人民进行耕种、收割、开荒、植树等农业劳动，和排水、打柴、修补房屋等家务劳动。
    这一切劳动，体现了国际主义思想，进一步增进了中朝友谊，也教育了部队广大官兵，提高了思想觉悟。
    志愿军指战员时刻关怀着祖国社会主义建设。祖国每一建设成就又都鼓舞着志愿军奋发前进。停战后，志愿军为支援祖国社会主义建设，展开大规模的生产节约运动。停战不久即实现了自给五个月蔬菜、两个月肉食的任务。部队普遍利用村边、营房边的隙地开荒种菜，自养猪羊。同时，厉行节约，爱护祖国供给的一滴汽油、一粒粮食，仅1956、1957两年就节约粮食一千多万斤。除此，全军还踊跃购买公债，年年都超过了预定指标。1955年我国农业合作化高潮中，志愿军展开了捐献运动，很短时间自动捐款购买拖拉机五十台，建成志愿军拖拉机站，献给祖国人民。志愿军这些生产节约、积极支援祖国社会主义建设的行动，受到全国人民热烈赞扬。
    满载胜利友谊而归
    由于社会主义力量胜过了帝国主义力量，和平力量胜过战争力量，国际形势出现了东风压倒西风的新的转折点，和平解决国际重大问题有了更大的可能。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府于1958年2月5日，提出了立即从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和实现朝鲜和平统一的各项建议。我国政府为打开和平解决朝鲜统一问题的僵局，缓和由美帝国主义所造成的远东紧张局势，与朝鲜政府磋商后，向中国人民志愿军提出了主动全部撤出朝鲜的建议。志愿军全体指战员热诚赞同我国政府的建议，并决定在1958年年底以前分三批全部撤出朝鲜。1958年2月19日中朝两国政府联合发表声明，宣布了志愿军的这一决定。志愿军从1958年3月15日在朝鲜人民欢送声中开始从朝鲜撤军，到10月底全部撤回祖国。志愿军为谋求和平所作的努力，不仅为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的现实途径，而且也显示了社会主义阵营力量的强大。志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的行动受到全世界爱好和平人民的普遍赞扬。而发动侵朝战争、阻挠朝鲜和平统一的美帝国主义侵略军队，却至今盘据着南朝鲜，受到全世界人民的斥责，更加陷于孤立。
    志愿军撤出朝鲜的过程中，进一步巩固和发展了中朝两国人民和军队以鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊。志愿军广大指战员按照志愿军党委“不骄不懈、善始善终，军队撤出，友谊长存”的方针，响应做到撤军“三好”（交好、走好、到好）的号召，掀起一个增进团结友谊的新高潮。各部队根据群众需要，不顾劳累，夜以继日地帮助朝鲜人民修渠、修坝、修房，植树……等许多劳动。许多部队提出“多出一把汗，多留一分友谊”，有的到临行前夕亦不停工。全军在分批撤出的情况下，协助朝鲜人民劳动的出工计划都一再突破，自宣布撤军到撤完为止，已达到一百五十四万余人工。
    志愿军移交防务给人民军的同时，将营房、营具、大量物资器材和医院的全套设备完整无偿地移交给人民军。所有部队都将伙食单位自养的猪羊、种的蔬菜、自制的生产工具赠给人民军接防部队。交接前，指战员们维修工事，清扫坑道和战壕，粉刷营房，美化环境，修饰俱乐部，增制用具。处处修整得整整齐齐，用意深切。人民军接防时，部队列队欢迎，像亲人般接待人民军战友，认真细致的交待防务。广大指战员拿出最心爱的礼物赠给人民军同志留念。两国军队亲密的战友之间，洋溢着牢固的战斗的深情。
    志愿军回国时，得到朝鲜政府和人民热情帮助和支援，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾专门为此作出决定。根据这个决定，朝鲜全民展开了在给中国人民志愿军和中国人民的感谢信上签名运动；展开了规模空前的全国性的朝中友好月活动；在平壤建成了志愿军烈士纪念塔，并将沙里院大街命名为中国人民志愿军大街；普遍给志愿军发了纪念章……。金日成首相和朝鲜党政领导人，亲临志愿军撤军部队驻地送别勉励。朝鲜人民热情欢送志愿军，临别前夕各地举行欢送大会。有的朝鲜父老携带礼品跋涉数十里，或远从数百里的地方，赶到志愿军部队的驻地送行。志愿军回国途中，所经过的地方，处处旗帜飘扬，鲜花飞舞，锣鼓喧天。朝鲜人民和志愿军互相间，诗一般友谊的话说了一遍又一遍，热情的眼泪流了一次又一次，送行的人送了一程又一程。志愿军战士和朝鲜人民怀着坚定的胜利信念，为共同的胜利和力量的增强而载歌载舞，但又忍不住依恋之情流下激情的眼泪。白发的朝鲜母亲将她结婚时的戒指送给志愿军战士，嘱咐他们把戒指传诸后代；年迈的朝鲜老大爷将祖传宝剑佩在志愿军干部身边；小学生把作业本捧给志愿军叔叔；人民军战士包一包英雄阵地上的泥土，交给战友带回祖国。千万件礼物带着千万颗朝鲜人民的心，体现着中朝人民深厚友谊。两国人民和军队之间流露的人间最珍贵、高尚而深厚的友情，显示了无产阶级国际主义团结的伟大力量。志愿军这样满载着朝鲜人民的友谊胜利凯旋。
    光辉的胜利和力量的源泉
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道，坚持抗美斗争整整八年时间。经过三年战争，中朝人民军队共歼灭敌军一百零九万余人，把侵略者赶回到它们发动进攻的地方——三八线，迫使敌人在停战协定上签了字，保卫了朝鲜的独立和祖国的安全，取得了以劣势装备战胜现代化敌人的经验，打乱了帝国主义发动新的侵略战争的时间表，捍卫了远东和世界和平。志愿军的胜利，向全世界宣告：正义的民族解放的事业必定胜利，而帝国主义侵略战争必然惨败。八年来，志愿军高举爱国主义与国际主义的红旗，英勇奋斗，艰苦奋斗，创造了无数功绩，出现了三十余万英雄模范和功臣，三十五万余人荣获了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的各级勋章、奖章。除彭德怀司令员外，还有胡修道、伍先华、杨春增、黄继光、丘少云、孙占元、杨根思、许家朋、李家发、杨连第、杨育才等十一位同志荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高荣誉——共和国英雄称号，为我国人民获得无尚光荣的国际声誉。
    中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一道能够战胜在装备上优于自己、号称头号帝国主义的美国侵略军，而且愈战愈强，这是由于战争正义性所决定的。除此，还在于：
    一、中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导。党领导中国人民刚刚取得新民主主义革命的胜利之后，当友邻朝鲜面临危难、祖国安全受到严重威胁的紧急关头，发出“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的伟大号召，组织志愿军出国作战。同时，领导全国人民进行了各项社会主义改造和社会主义建设。党和毛主席领导着全国人民，在“边打边建”的方针下，稳步向前奋进。朝鲜战场上的不断胜利，鼓舞、推动祖国建设战线；祖国的建设胜利，又鼓舞、支援了志愿军作战的胜利。祖国在战争中不仅未被削弱，建设事业反而蒸蒸日上。
    志愿军在战争中，以毛主席军事思想为作战指针。出国之初，根据朝鲜战场形势，决定了“以运动战为主，与部分阵地战、游击战结合”的正确战略方针，消灭了敌人有生力量，打退了敌人进攻。当五次战役之后，又适时地将战略方针转变为“持久作战、积极防御”，把军事斗争紧密服从于政治斗争，因此能屡战屡胜。志愿军在党和毛主席的教养下，发扬了高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，继承并发扬了人民军队的优良传统，严格遵循并发扬了党委领导和政治工作的原则；发扬了艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、机智顽强、上下团结一致等传统作风，和领导与群众相结合的群众路线。因此，才能团结成为钢铁般的整体，战胜千难万苦，战胜强敌。志愿军的胜利，就是毛主席思想的胜利。
    二、祖国人民的全力支援。在抗美援朝战争时期，六亿人民团结在党的周围，意志奋发，艰苦劳动。在工业战线上，在农业战线上，在各个岗位上，以自己的一切力量建设祖国和全力支援志愿军前线的斗争。祖国优秀儿女纷纷走上朝鲜前线，使志愿军不断涌入具有高度社会主义觉悟的坚强的新生力量；志愿军需要的一切武器、弹药、物资、装备，源源从祖国运上前线；抗美援朝捐献运动（捐款可购买飞机三千七百多架），大大改善了志愿军的装备；无数民工、铁路员工、医疗大队支援志愿军作战。祖国人民称志愿军为“最可爱的人”，多次派代表团、文工团到朝鲜慰问；对志愿军家属给予深切的关怀和照顾，在精神上予志愿军以极大鼓舞。这一切，成为志愿军物质和精神力量的源泉。志愿军在朝鲜战场上的斗争，反映了全国人民的斗争，抗美援朝战争实质是全民之战。战争的胜利，显示了我国社会主义制度的无比优越性，显示了中国人民的伟大力量。
    三、中朝两国人民及其军队的国际主义紧密团结。志愿军在朝鲜八年中，朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相，给予深切的关怀。对志愿军作战有功人员，授予勋章奖章；经常派代表团、艺术团慰问志愿军部队。为志愿军出版了中文报纸。金日成首相数次亲临志愿军作亲切的勉励。在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相领导下的朝鲜人民，在抗美战争时期虽然处于深重的灾难中，却尽一切可能支援志愿军。他们为志愿军运送粮弹、救护伤员；宁愿自己忍受饥寒，将粮食送给志愿军；把房屋让志愿军住；出现了无数舍身掩护志愿军伤员的朴在根式的国际主义战士和无数热爱志愿军的“志愿军妈妈”。志愿军与人民军并肩作战，同生死、共患难，密切协同，互相支援，共同完成战斗任务，结成牢不可破的战斗友谊。由于这一切，志愿军才能顺利完成抗美援朝任务。抗美战争的胜利，是无产阶级国际主义团结的伟大胜利。
    四、以苏联为首的和平民主力量的强大，和对抗美战争的声援和支持。以苏联为首的和平民主力量日益强大，遏止了美帝国主义扩大战争的企图。世界爱好和平人民展开反对侵略战争保卫和平的运动，有力支援了中朝人民的正义斗争，增强了志愿军战胜美帝国主义侵略的信心和力量。
    在光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，中国人民志愿军这支人民军队，进行正义的战争，受到中朝两国人民的全力支援，受到全世界人民的支持，这就是志愿军八年斗争中取得光辉胜利的力量的源泉。
