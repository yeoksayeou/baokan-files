Since the publication of Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" in our country, six days have passed. The artillery fire on the Jinmen front has subsided, but the situation in the Taiwan Strait remains turbulent.

The vast military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu welcome Minister Peng Dehuai's message. The military and civilians in Jinmen have freely obtained supplies. The hope for a peaceful resolution once again lingers in people's minds. However, the Taiwan authorities' publicly announced response cannot be considered serious or heartfelt. One moment they say it is a "trick," the next that it is a "breather before launching a new offensive," then that it is a demand for "unconditional surrender," and then that it is intended to "alienate Sino-American cooperation." Such pronouncements abound. Perhaps they have been fighting for too long, for thirty years, and inevitably have some "conditioned reflexes." This is understandable. However, anyone who thinks carefully can easily see that this is not a "trick" because the artillery fire has indeed stopped; nor is it a "breather," because the powerful People's Liberation Army has only moved a little finger in the past period, so why would it need to "breathe"? Nor is it a demand for "unconditional surrender," because Minister Peng Dehuai clearly said, "It is suggested to hold negotiations to achieve a peaceful solution." Since it is "negotiations" rather than a forced order, and it is a "peaceful solution" rather than a military one, it must of course be mutually agreeable, so how could it be "unconditional surrender"? People will probably not forget that more than two years and three months ago, Premier Zhou Enlai solemnly announced: "We treat all patriotic people, regardless of when they joined the patriotic ranks, and regardless of how much they have sinned in the past, in accordance with the principle of 'patriotism unites us all,' adopting an attitude of forgiving the past, welcoming them to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and will reward and properly settle them according to the size of their contributions." Minister Peng Dehuai's message is a solemn patriotic call, calling on all military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu to return to the embrace of the motherland.

As for "alienation," we really don't deserve it. Your relationship with the Americans is not pleasant to begin with, and we do not want to add fuel to the fire on this indecent axle. We only ask the Americans to stop interfering in our Chinese internal affairs and stop trying to ride on the heads of the Chinese people to shit and piss. You also know that living under someone else's roof and depending on their whims is not a pleasant experience. The Americans in Taiwan act like emperors, running rampant, raping, plundering, and engaging in all kinds of evil without restraint. Such humiliating days have lasted for nine years. Isn't it time to end this situation now? Of course, you may have your own ideas. But in any case, taking the American boat is not the way out, and the Americans' occupation of Taiwan will not have good results. Isn't that right? The Americans are now being watched by many eyes and pointed at by many fingers. Many nooses are around their necks, and even they themselves know that their fate is uncertain. Some people in the United States already feel that the current approach is not a long-term solution. They have proposed "demilitarization," "neutralization," and "trusteeship," and are even supporting people like Liao Wenyi. Of course, the Chinese people firmly oppose this, and I imagine you would not agree either, otherwise, where will you end up? Huang Shao-ku's extensive efforts in this regard are not without reason. As the general trend dictates, the Americans will eventually abandon you. As things stand, it is better sooner than later. Peace should be valued, and patriotism should be prioritized. Return to the fold. The door of the motherland is always open to all who return.

Chinese internal affairs should be handled by the Chinese themselves. Our civil war has lasted for thirty years. In these thirty years, there have been only one or two years without fighting. The rest of the time has been spent in wars of all sizes, large ones like the Huaihai Campaign and small ones like the current battles on the Jinmen front. This is an internal affair of China, and no foreign country has the right to interfere. It is precisely for this reason that we firmly reject the so-called "ceasefire" proposed by the Americans. There has been no fire between China and the United States, and there is no fire to stop. There is war within China. The war is being fought by the Chinese themselves. Whether to fight or stop, how long to fight, and how long to stop should and can only be decided by the Chinese themselves. Now, our army on the Fujian front has stopped shelling Jinmen from October 6th, with a temporary duration of one week, conditional on the absence of American warships escorting supplies. This is giving the Jinmen Chiang forces an opportunity to replenish supplies and also giving the Taiwan authorities an opportunity to consider a peaceful solution.

The current moment is also a test for the Americans. Dulles admits that it is "not easy to assess" Minister Peng Dehuai's message, saying that he wants to "study the situation," but he portrays our army's temporary cessation of shelling Jinmen for one week as the so-called "ceasefire" that the United States has been seeking. This is of course absurd and ridiculous. Now they are asking for a "permanent ceasefire," which is even more preposterous. The Chinese people have long firmly rejected the American so-called "ceasefire," not only because there is no fire to stop between China and the United States, but also, more importantly, because the American "ceasefire" is a trick, attempting to induce China to agree to the United States expanding its scope of aggression from Taiwan and Penghu to Kinmen and Matsu, legalizing American aggression, and tying the hands and feet of the Chinese people in liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is of course unacceptable to the Chinese people. Now, the Chinese government suggests holding direct peace talks with the Taiwan authorities. Dulles has been thrown into a very awkward situation. Didn't Dulles say that he wanted to "promote the realization of justice and lasting peace"? If this is not a lie, the United States must pass five hurdles: first, stop "escorting"; second, stop infringing on China's territorial waters and airspace; third, stop military provocations and threats of war; fourth, stop interfering in China's internal affairs; and fifth, withdraw all American armed forces from Taiwan and Penghu. What has been the situation in the past few days? Regarding escorting, the US State Department announced on the 8th that it would suspend escorting the Chiang forces, which can be considered as accepting the conditions put forward by our Ministry of National Defense, but it is extremely incomplete, still leaving a tail for resuming "escorting." Regarding American ships and planes intruding into China's territorial waters and airspace, it has happened many times in the past six days. After 6:00 AM on the 7th, no intrusion incidents occurred on the Kinmen side, but American ships and planes were successively detected intruding into China's territorial waters and airspace in the Matsu and Pingtan areas. This hurdle cannot be said to have been passed yet. As for the other three hurdles, the United States needs to demonstrate them with actions. In any case, these five hurdles must be passed. Without passing these five hurdles, how can it be called "promoting the realization of justice and lasting peace"? China is willing to negotiate with the United States and peacefully resolve the disputes between the two countries. These negotiations are underway in Warsaw. The problem now depends on whether the United States has the sincerity to resolve the disputes. Whether it passes these five hurdles is a test of the United States' sincerity.

Now, both the Taiwan authorities and the American government face the question of where to go. However, the nature of these two questions is completely different. The question before the Taiwan authorities is an internal affair of the Chinese people. Whether it is the supply of Jinmen, or the time, place, and steps of the peace talks, the Chinese themselves can solve it. The Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu issue can be resolved comprehensively and peacefully. The question before the American government is a matter between China and the United States. If the United States is truly sincere, it is not difficult to find a solution under the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and non-use of force or threats.

It seems that the problem still needs to be observed and tested, and the time for resolution is still far away. Imperialism is, after all, imperialism, and reactionaries are, after all, reactionaries. Let's see how they move!

    且看他们怎样动作
    我国防部彭德怀部长“告台湾同胞书”发表以来，已经六天了。金门前线炮声沉寂，但台湾海峡风浪依然。
    台澎金马广大军民同胞是欢迎彭德怀部长的文告的。金门军民已经自由地获得供应。和平解决的希望又一次在人们心里萦回。但是台湾当局公开宣布的反应不能认为是认真的、由衷的。一则说这是“骗局”，一则说这是“发动新攻势前的喘息”，一则说这是要“无条件投降”，一则说这是“离间中美合作关系”，诸如此类，不一而足。大概是打仗打久了，三十年了，难免有些“条件反射”，这是可以理解的。但是，任何深思熟虑的人都不难看到，这不是“骗局”，因为炮火千真万确地停止了；这也不是“喘息”，强大的人民解放军在过去一个时期中只不过动了一个小指头，何需“喘息”？这也不是要“无条件投降”，因为彭德怀部长明明是说“建议举行谈判，实行和平解决”，既是“谈判”而不是强迫命令，又是“和平解决”而不是武力解决，当然要两相情愿，又怎么会是“无条件投降”？人们大概不会忘记，两年又三个多月以前，周恩来总理曾经郑重宣布：“我们对于一切爱国的人们，不论他们参加爱国行列的先后，也不论他们过去犯了多大罪过，都本着‘爱国一家’的原则，采取既往不咎的态度，欢迎他们为和平解放台湾建立功勋，并且还将按照他们立功大小，给以应得的奖励和适当的安置。”彭德怀部长的文告，是一个爱国主义的庄严号召，号召台澎金马所有军民同胞重新回到祖国的怀抱。
    至于说到“离间”，实在受之有愧。你们和美国人的关系本来就不美妙，我们不想也不屑在这不体面的轴承上添油加醋。我们只要求美国人休管我们中国人内部的事情，休想骑在中国人头上拉屎撒尿。你们也知道，寄人篱下，仰承鼻息，滋味是不好受的。美国人在台湾以太上皇自居，横行霸道，奸淫掳掠，无孔不入，无恶不作，这样的屈辱的日月，于兹九年，难道现在还不是结束这种局面的时候吗？当然，你们也可能有你们的想法。但是无论如何，搭美国人的船不是出路，而且美国人霸占台澎也不会有好结果。可不是吗？美国人现在是十目所视，十手所指，许多绞索套在脖子上，连他们自己也知道命途多舛了。美国已经有人觉得目前的作法不是长治久安之计，已经有什么“非军事化”、“中立化”、“托管”，还搞什么廖文毅之类，这当然是中国人民坚决反对的，想来你们也不会同意，否则到头来将何处安身呢？你们的黄少谷为此大费唇舌，不是没有缘故的。大势所趋，美国人终究是要抛弃你们的。事到如今，宜早不宜迟，还是要以和平为贵，以爱国为重，憣然来归。祖国的大门始终是为一切来归的人敞开着的。
    中国内部的事情应当由中国人自己处理。我们的内战，三十年了。这三十年中，有一两年没有打，其余的时间都消磨在大大小小的战争中，大的如淮海战役，小的如目前金门前线的战斗。这是中国内部的事，任何外国无权过问。正是因为这个缘故，我们坚决拒绝美国人提出的所谓“停火”。中美之间并未开火，根本无火可停。中国内部是有战火的，仗是由中国人自己打的，是打是停，打多久，停多久，应当而且也只能由中国人自己解决。现在，福建前线我军已从10月6日起停止对金门的炮击，并暂以一周为期，以没有美国军舰护航为条件。这是给金门蒋军以补充给养的机会，也是给台湾当局考虑和平解决的机会。
    目前也是考验美国人的时刻。杜勒斯承认对彭德怀部长的文告“进行估价是不容易的”，说是要“研究一下局势”，但是他又把我军暂在一周内停止炮击金门说成是美国一直谋求的所谓“停火”。这当然是荒谬可笑的。现在又来要求“永久停火”，那就更加荒唐了。中国人民早就坚决拒绝了美国的所谓“停火”，这不仅因为中美之间无火可停，而且更重要的是因为美国的“停火”是一个诡计，企图诱使中国同意美国把侵略范围从台澎扩大到金马，使美国的侵略合法化，束缚中国人民解放台、澎、金、马的手脚。这当然是中国人民不能容许的。现在，中国政府建议同台湾当局直接进行和谈。杜勒斯已经被抛到一个十分尴尬的境地。杜勒斯不是说过要“促进实现正义和持久和平”吗？如果这不是假话，美国就必须过五关：一曰停止“护航”；二曰停止侵犯中国大陆的领海领空；三曰停止军事挑衅和战争威胁；四曰停止干涉中国内政；五曰从台澎撤退美国全部武装力量。过去几天的情况怎样？关于护航，美国国务院8日宣布暂停给蒋军护航，这总算是接受了我国防部提出的条件，但极不彻底，还留着一个准备恢复“护航”的尾巴。关于美舰、美机侵入中国大陆领海领空，6日内发生了多次，7日上午六时以后金门方面尚未发生侵入事件，但在马祖和平潭方面却接连发现美舰、美机侵入中国领海领空。这一关还不能说已经过了。至于其他三关，更有待于美国用行动去表现。无论如何，这五关是必须过的，不过五关，又怎能叫做“促进实现正义和持久和平”呢？中国是愿意同美国进行谈判，和平解决两国之间的争端的。这个谈判正在华沙进行。现在的问题取决于美国是否具有解决争端的诚意。是否过这五关，就是对美国的诚意的考验。
    现在摆在台湾当局和美国政府面前的，都有一个何去何从的问题。不过，这两个问题的性质是截然不同的。在台湾当局面前的问题，是中国人内部的事情，不论是金门的供应，不论是和谈的时间、地点和步骤，是中国人自己能够解决的。台澎金马问题，是可以求得全面和平解决的。在美国政府面前的问题，是中国和美国两国之间的问题，如果美国真有诚意的话，在互相尊重领土主权完整、互不干涉内政、互不使用武力或威胁的原则下，也是不难求得解决的。
    看来，问题尚有待于观察和考验，离解决之期尚很远。帝国主义到底是帝国主义，反动派到底是反动派。且看一看他们究竟怎样动作吧！
