Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 24th—Washington News: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles returned to Washington early this morning. Speaking to reporters at the airport, he boasted that his talks with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei were "extremely satisfactory."

	In order to cover up the aggressive conspiracy he plotted in Taipei, he insisted that "the issue of war or peace" "rests with the Communists," and he falsely accused the Chinese people of being "aggressive by nature."

	Dulles refused to comment on the news that Chiang Kai-shek had agreed to reduce the garrison on Quemoy, saying, "We only discussed principles – that was just a detail."

    杜勒斯回到华盛顿
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯今天清晨回到华盛顿。他在机场上对记者发表谈话时，吹嘘他同蒋介石在台北的会谈是“极为令人满意的”。
    为了掩盖他在台北策划的侵略阴谋，他硬说，现在“是战争还是和平”，“都在于共产党人了”，他诬蔑中国人民“侵略成性”。
    杜勒斯拒绝评论关于蒋介石已经同意减少金门驻军的消息，他说，“我们只讨论了原则——那不过是一个细节而已。”
