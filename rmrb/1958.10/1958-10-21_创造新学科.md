Creating New Disciplines

"Field Design Science" is a brand-new discipline, and Wang Baojing, a "native expert" from Shaanxi, is studying it. People accustomed to old traditions may ask: Wang Baojing, how dare he create something like "Field Design Science"?

Any discipline in the world is explored by people in practice. What the predecessors were able to do, why can't today's Chinese farmers create newer disciplines?

Wild ideas can be realized, and by getting rid of the old, the new can emerge. New theories, new disciplines, and new traditions will surely be created by the new generation.

    创造新学科
    “田间设计学”是一门崭新的学科，陕西“土专家”王保京正在研究它。习惯于旧传统的人也许会问：王保京，他怎敢创立什么“田间设计学”？
    世界上任何一门学科都是人在实践中摸索出来的，前人能够作得到的事情，今天的中国农民，为什么不能创造出更新的学科呢？
    异想就能天开，推陈可以出新。新的理论，新的学科，新的传统一定会在新的一代手中创造出来。
