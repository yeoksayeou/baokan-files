Reported from Nanjing on October 22nd by our correspondent Shi Yue'e: The Puzhen Passenger Car and Vehicle Repair Factory in Nanjing has mobilized the masses to carry out a technical revolution in indigenous blast furnaces. The entire factory used local methods and waste materials to manufacture more than twenty kinds of tools, such as ore crushers, charging machines, mixing machines, sand screening machines, furnace lining molds, and electric pneumatic hammers for furnace construction, so that a series of processes from furnace construction and smelting to auxiliary labor in indigenous blast furnaces all used machinery. More than a thousand women and apprentice workers were liberated from heavy labor. The quality of pig iron has also been improved.

After this factory launched a mass campaign for indigenous iron smelting, the labor force was quite strained. There were people everywhere on the construction site, which was very chaotic. Accidents such as hands being injured by hammering ore and burns from adding materials were common. In order to transition iron and steel production from a temporary state to a regular one, the factory Party committee put forward the slogan of "using both hands and brains," calling on everyone to make use of the factory's favorable conditions, rely on their own efforts, overcome difficulties, and vigorously carry out a technical revolution. In this way, a iron smelting technical revolution, led by veteran workers, was launched with great fanfare throughout the factory. Zheng Wen'an, the secretary of the Communist Youth League general branch of the preparation workshop, and several League members worked hard for three days and nights, using waste materials to make a twelve-horsepower ore crusher, which could process thirty tons of ore a day, enough to replace the labor of one hundred people. Zhu Aisheng, the repair furnace team leader of the passenger car workshop, saw that workers were adding materials at high altitudes next to the scorching furnace, which was both tiring and dangerous. Based on the principle of the hoist, he made a trapezoidal wooden frame automatic lifting charging machine, which was safe to operate and increased labor efficiency four or five times.

The factory Party committee immediately promoted these two creations throughout the factory. In less than a month, tool reforms in various processes emerged one after another like a chain reaction. Since manual mixing of refractory mud was uneven, veteran worker Zhang Ricai welded many small iron pieces around a scrap iron bar and installed it on an electric drill to make a authentic indigenous mixing machine. In order to make the furnace wall more solid, workers in the preparation workshop came up with the idea of ​​using a pneumatic hammer to strike it. Only one person needs to stand in the center of the furnace and hold the pneumatic hammer to compact it, and one person can add refractory mud to line the furnace, replacing the labor of dozens of people in the past.

In the past, because the quality of iron smelted by this factory was not high, many people wavered in their confidence in indigenous iron smelting methods. Shen Yongfang, a technician at the foundry, found that the reason for the poor quality of indigenous iron was mainly the low furnace temperature. He created a sealed gas blowing hot air method that combined indigenous and foreign methods to increase the furnace temperature. The preparation workshop built two ventilation furnaces based on his suggestion. Since the furnaces started operating, each furnace has produced high-quality gray iron. Recently, the foundry has boldly smelted sintered iron, which contains the most impurities such as phosphorus and sulfur, in a cupola furnace at high temperatures, and has also obtained better gray iron.

    改革冶炼工具　减轻劳动强度
    浦镇开展土高炉技术革命
    本报南京22日电　记者史越峨报道：南京浦镇客车车辆修理工厂发动群众开展土高炉技术革命。全厂用土办法和废料制成碎矿机、加料机、捣拌机、筛沙机、搪炉模具、砌炉电风锤等二十多种工具，使土高炉从建炉、冶炼到辅助劳动的一系列过程都使用了机械。一千多名妇女和学徒工从笨重的劳动中解放出来。生铁的质量也有所提高。
    这个工厂开展群众性的土法炼铁运动以后，劳动力相当紧张，工地上到处是人，十分混乱，砸矿石敲伤手，加料烫伤的现象很普遍。为了让钢铁生产从临时转入经常，厂党委提出了“手脑并用”的口号，号召大家利用工厂的有利条件，自力更生，克服困难，大闹技术革命。这样以老工人为首的炼铁技术革命 就在全厂轰轰烈烈地开展起来。制备车间团总支委员郑文安和几个团员苦战三昼夜，用废料制成一台十 二马力的碎矿机，一天加工三十吨矿石，足可以代替一百个人的劳动。客车车间的修炉组长朱爱生看到工人在灼热的炉边进行高空加料，既累又危险，就根据卷扬机的原理，制成一台梯形木架自动直升加料机，操作安全，提高劳动效率四、五倍。
    厂党委立即将这两件创造在全厂推广，不到一个月，各道工序上的工具改革就像连锁反应一样地一个一个地涌现出来了。人工捣拌耐火泥不均匀，老工人张日才就在一根废铁条的四周焊接了许多小铁梗，装在电钻上做成一把道地的土捣拌机。制备车间工人为了使炉壁更坚实，想出用风力锤击的窍门，只要一个人站在炉心中央扶着风锤捣固，一个人加耐火泥就可以搪好炉膛，代替了过去几十个人的劳动。
    过去由于这个工厂炼的铁质量不高，不少人动摇了对土法炼铁的信心。翻砂场技术员沈永芳找到了土铁质量不高的原因主要是炉温不高，就创造了一种土洋结合的密封式煤气吹热风的方法，提高炉温。制备车间根据他的建议修建了二座通风炉，开炉以来炉炉都出质量好的灰口铁。最近，翻砂场又大胆地把含磷含硫等杂质最多的烧结铁在冲天炉里高温熔炼，也得出了较好的灰口铁。
