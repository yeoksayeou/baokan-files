Holiday Offensive
By our Shanghai reporter

    As the National Day salute resounded through the sky and the jubilant parade with red flags waving advanced through the streets, the battle drums continued to thunder on all fronts of Shanghai's fight for steel. On the 1st, millions of workers, students, and government cadres gave up their holidays and entered workshops, construction sites, stations, and docks... The city's kindergartens also broke with the usual National Day holiday, allowing the parents of the children to go to the steel front to fight with peace of mind. The heroic people of Shanghai, on the basis of creating a high-yield satellite of 4,463 tons of steel on September 30, are determined to turn National Day into a bumper harvest festival and launch even higher and larger steel satellites in October.
    
    "Firmly Guard the Position, Make Every Furnace Red"
    
    At zero hour on National Day morning, the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 suddenly became bustling, with the sound of gongs and drums accompanied by the roar of blowers. The blazing furnace fire made the big red bulletin of the good news team particularly dazzling, and the faces of the steelworkers glowed red. An excited voice came from the loudspeaker: Comrades, the target for celebrating National Day has been achieved! On September 30, the entire workshop produced 690 tons of steel, and the utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace reached 22.4 tons, surpassing the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, the national high-yield red flag. Salute to the steelworkers! The workers cheered and jumped for joy, and began the tense labor of the National Day holiday on October 1.
    
    This time, the workers of Team B, who continued to fight, smelted three more heats of rapid steelmaking, with smelting times of about four and a half hours, shortening the average smelting time in September by one and a half hours.
    
    Zhou Xiangsheng, the furnace chief of Furnace No. 1 of Team C, and steelworkers Zhong Daming, Huang Jieshi, and others, worked from 7:00 a.m. on the 30th until 12:00 p.m., and came to the factory again at 5:00 or 6:00 a.m. on the 1st after the next shift of workers came to work. Zhou Xiangsheng and his steelmaking team created an unprecedented record of smelting a heat of steel (furnace output of 57 tons) in three hours and forty-seven minutes on the 30th. On the 1st, they encountered a bad furnace bottom condition, and a heat of steel exceeded the prescribed time. Everyone was determined to immediately catch up the time. When sintering the furnace bottom, the whole team cooperated. The workshop stipulated that it should be completed in three and a half hours, but they completed it in only three hours and ten minutes, which saved twenty minutes.
    
    Chen Lin, the deputy secretary of the factory Party committee, who lost a leg in the war, although inconvenient to move, worked with the workers for more than thirty hours on the 30th and came to the workshop again on the morning of the 1st. He encouraged everyone: In October, we must firmly guard the position, make every furnace red and every shift red, and strive to complete the plan for every furnace and every shift. The workers made a resounding guarantee to him: We must stick to our positions, not only learn from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, but also surpass Plant No. 3, not only surpass it in one day, but surpass it in one night, surpass it every night, and seize the national high-yield red flag!
    
    On the Second Battlefield of Steel
    
    After the basic construction workers built the first batch of new workshops with an annual output of 1.5 million tons of steel at an unprecedented speed, they have now entered the second front. They are determined to build another batch of new workshops with an annual output of 1.2 million tons of steel at an even faster speed. The converter steelmaking workshop construction site of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5 is again the main attack position on the newly opened second front. Ten days ago, this was still a field. On the 1st, two rows of huge reinforced concrete roof columns have been erected, and the prototype of the city's largest steelmaking workshop can already be seen. Thousands of workers and cadres are striving to complete the factory building construction project on October 5 and start the furnace for steel production within the month. On the 1st, the entire team worked in the rain. They wore straw sandals, capes, and cloaks, and even covered themselves with straw mats on their backs, digging earthwork and pouring concrete in the wind and rain. Groups of trucks, rubber-wheeled vehicles, and handcarts were shoulder-to-shoulder and continuously transporting materials on the temporarily built muddy roads. Many workers entered the construction site before 7:00 a.m. Lu Yunsheng's concrete team worked from 7:00 a.m. on the 30th until late at night, and投入战斗 again投入战斗投入战斗 on the morning of the 1st despite the rain.
    
    "Fully Loaded with Coking Coal to Qiantang"
    
    The reporter came to the misty Huangpu River. On the wharves stretching along the river, the roar of various loading and unloading machinery and the shouts of people resounded as one. 12,000 dockworkers at Shanghai Port are persisting in tense battles.
    
    Next to the wharf where the "Peace No. 20" ship was docked, the twenty-four workers of the 19th team were standing on a coal pile more than three feet high, rapidly loading the coking coal transported from the Northeast into mesh bags, and letting the crane lift it onto the belt conveyor, rolling it to the ship's window. This coal will be transported to steel factories in Zhejiang on the 1st. The twenty-four people were divided into three teams and launched a fierce competition.
    
    The team was scheduled to start work at 6:00 a.m. But as soon as four o'clock struck, they came to the dock. They held a pre-shift meeting and proposed: Don't stop working in heavy rain, speed up in light rain, and transport the coal out as soon as possible to support steelmaking in Zhejiang!
    
    At 2:00 p.m., it was time for them to get off work, but the "Peace No. 20" ship was not yet fully loaded. Someone suggested postponing getting off work, and everyone scrambled to agree: If the ship doesn't leave, we won't leave either.
    
    When the "Peace No. 20" left carrying more than 2,700 tons of coking coal, it was already 3:00 p.m.
    
    "Ahead of the Salutes"
    
    On National Day morning, before dawn, the open-air construction site of the Qiuxin Shipyard was brightly lit. The workers were rushing to complete the final work on the six sets of cupola furnaces and five sets of hot blast furnaces needed for the steel plant. They were determined to complete the manufacture of this batch of smelting equipment before the salutes were fired. Suddenly, it began to rain heavily. The workers continued to work in the open-air construction site despite the rain. Zhuang Bowen, the assembly team leader of the shipbuilding workshop, who had only slept for six hours in four days and four nights, climbed onto the tall crane and held up a large umbrella at the mouth of the huge cupola furnace to prevent rainwater from entering the furnace. After getting off the crane, he and the assembly workers climbed from the muddy ground next to the furnace into the furnace body to assemble the last water tank.
    
    At 6:00 a.m. on the 1st, the workers had successfully completed the task of this batch of smelting equipment. The Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau and the steel plant were delighted to hear the good news and quickly sent people to inspect and accept it, and sent banners and big-character posters to express their gratitude.
    
    At exactly 8:00 a.m. on the 1st, when the loud salutes of the city celebrating National Day came from the loudspeakers on the construction site, the workers of the Qiuxin Shipyard投入战斗 again投入战斗投入战斗 into the battle to rush to make the second batch of smelting equipment. They put forward a new guarantee: to complete this batch of equipment, originally scheduled to be completed on the 10th and 15th, ahead of schedule on the 5th and 12th of this month, respectively.

    节日出击
    本报上海记者
    正当庆祝国庆节的礼炮响彻云霄，红旗招展的欢腾的游行队伍在街头前进的时候，上海全市为钢而战的各条阵线上依然战鼓隆隆。上百万的工人、学生、机关干部，1日放弃休假，走进车间、工地、车站、码头……，全市的幼儿园也打破国庆休假的常规，让孩子们的父母亲安心赴钢铁前线战斗。英雄的上海人民，在9月30日创造日产四千四百六十三吨钢的高产卫星的基础上，决心把国庆节变为丰产节，在10月份放出更高更大的钢铁卫星。
    “牢守阵地炉炉红”
    国庆日清晨零时，上钢一厂的平炉车间忽然喧腾起来，锣鼓声伴着鼓风机轰鸣，熊熊炉火照得报喜队的大红喜报特别耀眼，炼钢工人们脸上发出红光。扩音器里传出兴奋的声音：同志们向国庆节献礼的指标达到了，9月30日，全车间生产了六百九十吨钢，平炉利用系数达到二十二点四吨，赶过了全国平炉高产红旗的上钢三厂平炉车间。向炼钢工人们致敬！工人们欢呼、雀跃，开始了10月1日国庆节日的紧张劳动。
    这次，紧接着战斗的乙班工人继续炼出了三炉快速炼钢，冶炼时间都在四小时半左右，比9月份平均冶炼时间缩短一个半小时。
    丙班一号炉炉长、炼钢工周祥生和锺大明、黄介石等几人，30日从早晨七时上班，战斗到晚上十二时，等下一班的工人上工后才回家，1日清晨五、六点钟又来到了厂里。周祥生和他的炼钢小组30日创造了三小时四十七分炼一炉钢（炉产量五十七吨）的空前纪录，1日遇到炉底情况不好，一炉钢超过了规定时间。大家决心立刻把时间抓回来，在烧结炉底的时候，全组配合动作，车间规定三个半小时完成，他们只花了三小时十分就干完了，这一下就夺回来二十分钟。
    曾经在战争中失去了一条腿的厂党委副书记陈林，虽然行动不便，30日和工人们一起连干了三十多个小时，1日上午又来到车间。他鼓励大家：10月份要牢守阵地，做到炉炉红，班班红，争取每炉每班都完成计划。工人们向他提出了响亮的保证：一定坚守阵地，不仅要学习上钢三厂，还要赶过三厂，不仅要一天赶过，要一夜赶过，夜夜赶过，把全国高产红旗夺过来！
    在钢铁第二战场上
    基本建设工人们以空前的速度建成第一批年产一百五十万吨钢的新车间后，现在已投入第二战线，他们决心要以更快的速度再建设起一批年产一百二十万吨钢的新车间。上海第五钢厂转炉炼钢车间工地，又是新辟第二战线的主攻阵地。十天以前，这里还是一片田野，1日，已经竖起了两排巨大的钢筋混凝土屋柱，全市面积最大的炼钢车间雏形已经看得出来。成千的工人和干部为了争取在10月5日完成厂房建筑工程，月内开炉出钢，1日，全体冒雨施工。他们脚蹬草鞋、披着蓑衣、斗篷，甚至在背上随便遮一块草席，在风雨中挖土方、浇灌混凝土。成群的大卡车、胶轮车和手推车并肩接踵络绎不绝地在临时筑起的泥泞的道路上奔驰着运送物料。很多工人早上不到七时就进入工地。陆云生混凝土小队30日从早上七时一直干到深夜，1日清早又冒雨投入战斗。
    “满载焦煤下钱塘”
    记者来到了烟雨迷蒙的黄浦江边，沿江伸展的港口码头上，各种装卸机械的轰鸣、人们的号子声交响成一片。上海港一万二千码头工人在坚持着紧张的战斗。
    在“和平二十号”轮停泊的码头旁，第十九小组的二十四个工人正站在三丈多高的煤堆上，飞速地把这些从东北运来的炼焦煤装上网袋，让起重机吊往皮带运输机上，滚滚运向轮船窗口。这些煤1日就将运往浙江的钢铁工厂。二十四个人分成三个队，展开了热烈的竞赛。
    这个小组规定是清晨六时上班。但四点钟刚敲过，他们就来到码头上。他们召开了班前会议，他们提出：大雨不停工，小雨加紧干，尽快把煤装运出去，支援浙江炼钢！
    下午二时，该是他们下班的时候了，但“和平二十号”的船舱还没有满载。有人提议推迟下班，大家都争着赞同：船不走，我们也不离开。
    当“和平二十号”载着二千七百多吨炼焦煤离去的时候，已经是三点钟了。
    “赶在礼炮的前面”
    国庆节早晨，天还未亮，求新造船厂的露天工地上灯火辉煌。工人们紧张地突击钢铁厂必需的六套化铁炉和五套热风炉的最后的工作。他们决心要赶在礼炮鸣放以前，全部完成这一批冶炼设备的制造任务。忽然，天下起了倾盆大雨，工人们冒着雨仍在露天工地上坚持工作。四天四夜只睡了六小时的造船车间装配小组长庄伯温，他爬上了高高的吊车，在巨大的化铁炉口，撑起了一把大雨伞防止雨水打进炉内。下了吊车，他又和装配工人们从炉旁的泥浆地面上爬进炉体内，装配最后一个水箱。
    1日早上六点钟，工人们已经胜利地完成了这批冶炼设备的任务。市冶金工业局和钢铁厂欣闻这个喜讯，赶紧派人前来验收，并且送来了表示感谢的锦旗和大字报。
    1日早上八点正，工地喇叭里传来全市人民庆祝国庆节的隆隆礼炮声的时候，求新造船厂的工人又投入了赶制第二批冶炼设备的战斗了。他们提出了新的保证：要在本月5日和12日分别提早完成原订在10日和15日完成的这批设备。
