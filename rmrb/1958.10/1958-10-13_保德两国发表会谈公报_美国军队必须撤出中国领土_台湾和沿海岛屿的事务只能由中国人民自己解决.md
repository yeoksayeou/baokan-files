Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 10th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the talks between the party and government delegations of Bulgaria and East Germany concluded this afternoon, and a joint communiqué was signed.

Signing the communiqué on behalf of Bulgaria were Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, and Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers; signing on behalf of East Germany were Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Prime Minister Grotewohl.

The talks took place in an atmosphere of sincerity, mutual understanding, and complete agreement on all issues.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 11th: After the conclusion of the negotiations between the party and government delegations of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of Bulgaria, a communiqué was issued in Sofia. The communiqué stated that the two delegations exchanged views on important international issues and tasks in the struggle for peace, and that they were in complete agreement on these issues.

The communiqué stated that the two governments sternly condemn the war provocations of the US imperialists against the People's Republic of China. They demand that the United States immediately cease interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw US troops from Chinese territory.

The communiqué emphasized that the affairs of Taiwan and the Chinese coastal islands are the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and can only be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. Both sides reiterated that, for the sake of world peace, it is absolutely necessary for the People's Republic of China to obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations.

The communiqué stated that the two countries welcome the just struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for national liberation and independence. They condemn the aggression of the United States and Britain against Lebanon and Jordan, and demand that British and American troops withdraw from these countries immediately.

The two party delegations believe that revisionism is the main danger in the current international workers' movement. The two party delegations declared that this revisionism is most clearly manifested in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Therefore, the two party delegations oppose this program, considering it harmful to the international workers' movement, and condemn Yugoslavia's recent nationalistic and chauvinistic slander against Bulgaria.

The communiqué also pointed out that the Bulgarian government supports the German Democratic Republic's proposal to immediately begin preparations for a German peace treaty, and it agrees with the German Democratic Republic's position that the only possible path for German reunification is the establishment of a confederation composed of the two German states.

The two governments said that they are determined to continue to devote themselves to consolidating the unity and fraternal friendship among the countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, on the basis of proletarian internationalism.

The two delegations decided to expand relations between the two countries, especially to develop cultural relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 12th: The East German party and government delegation, led by Ulbricht and Grotewohl, left Sofia by special plane this morning to return home after a five-day visit to Bulgaria.

Bulgarian party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and others saw them off at the airport.

Before leaving, Zhivkov and Ulbricht spoke at the airport. They expressed their firm belief that the delegation's visit to Bulgaria would help further strengthen the fraternal friendship and cooperation between Bulgaria and Germany, and among the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
