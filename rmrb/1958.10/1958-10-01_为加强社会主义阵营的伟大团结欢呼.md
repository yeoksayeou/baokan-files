On the eve of our glorious National Day, the China-Albania, China-Bulgaria, China-Hungary, China-Vietnam, China-Germany, China-Korea, China-Mongolia, China-Poland, China-Romania, and China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Associations were simultaneously established in Beijing. This is a major event in the development of friendship between the Chinese people and the people of socialist brother countries, following the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association many years ago, which has powerfully promoted the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The establishment of the ten new friendship associations marks a further strengthening of the friendly unity and mutual cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of various brother countries.

The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, like brothers, has always been united in friendship and mutual cooperation. Socialist countries are a new type of country, and their mutual relations are also a new type of relationship. The mutual relations of the socialist camp are primarily based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, as well as on principles of complete equality, respecting territorial integrity, respecting national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Comrade Mao Zedong once highly appraised this relationship, saying: "Since the beginning of history, no relationship between any countries has been as close as that between socialist countries, sharing weal and woe, respecting and trusting each other, helping and encouraging each other." In the socialist camp, the Soviet Union, the most powerful and experienced, has always provided multifaceted selfless assistance to its brother countries. Socialist countries also help each other and cooperate with each other. China's socialist construction has always received sincere assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries; at the same time, the Chinese people regard the socialist and communist construction of the brother countries as a common cause of the socialist camp and contribute their strength to this cause. The Chinese people, like the people of all brother countries, are increasingly aware of the great political significance of the friendly unity and mutual support of the people of socialist countries in the struggle for socialist construction and peace.

The socialist camp has always pursued a foreign policy of peace, advocating peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and always supporting the national independence movements of all countries and the struggle of the world's people for peace. The united and rock-solid socialist camp is a strong fortress of world peace, a strong pillar of national independence movements in various countries, and a loyal friend of peace-loving people in all countries. Just by reviewing the history of the past few years, we can clearly see how outstanding a role the socialist camp has played in safeguarding world peace. The governments and people of the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as all peace-loving countries and people, jointly extinguished the wars in Korea and Indochina created by the imperialist countries headed by U.S. imperialism. The people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries unanimously supported the Egyptian people's war of self-defense against the tripartite aggression of Britain, France, and Israel and the Syrian people's resistance to the U.S. aggression plot, and unanimously supported the struggle of the Lebanese and Jordanian people against U.S.-British aggression and the Iraqi people against U.S.-British threats. In the past year, the Soviet Union, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and other socialist countries have put forward a series of peace proposals. The Soviet Union was the first to suspend nuclear weapons testing, and the governments of China and Korea jointly decided to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. All these facts demonstrate the significant contributions made by the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union to the cause of world peace.

The current characteristic of the international situation is that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. The socialist and communist construction of the socialist camp is flourishing; the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing vigorously; while in the imperialist camp, a profound and serious economic crisis has occurred, first in the most developed capitalist country, the United States; the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is unprecedentedly isolated. This situation is very favorable for the struggle of the people of the world for peace. Under this situation, further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp will make greater contributions to the cause of world peace.

The aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism has always been hostile to the socialist camp. They are constantly engaging in slander and rumor-mongering against the socialist camp, attempting to provoke and undermine the unity of the socialist camp. They are constantly clamoring for anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and "liberating Eastern European countries"; the U.S. Congress has even passed the so-called "Mutual Security" Act, publicly allocating hundreds of millions of dollars each year specifically for carrying out criminal activities to subvert the regimes of socialist camp countries. U.S. imperialism and its partners have carried out a long-term blockade and "embargo" against the socialist camp countries. U.S. imperialism is also actively building a series of military bases around the socialist camp countries, attempting to encircle and invade the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. However, all the aggression and sabotage activities of imperialism against the socialist camp can only end in failure. The war of aggression against Korea launched by U.S. imperialism and its support for France's aggression against Vietnam, as well as the subversive activities against Hungary instigated by U.S. imperialism, have all suffered shameful defeats. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the Warsaw Pact have powerfully defended the security of the socialist camp and defended peace in Europe, Asia, and the world.

Today, after the failure of its aggression in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism is carrying out frantic military provocations and war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, attempting to continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan and expand its aggression to our coastal islands. The provocations by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait area are not only a provocation against the Chinese people, but also a provocation against the entire socialist camp and a provocation against world peace. This criminal act of U.S. imperialism is intolerable to the 600 million people of our country, and it is also intolerable to the people of all socialist camp countries and all peace-loving people in the world. Comrade Khrushchev warned U.S. President Eisenhower that an infringement upon China is an infringement upon the Soviet Union, that the United States must forever end its interference in China, that the U.S. fleet must withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area, and that U.S. troops must leave Taiwan and go home. The deep sympathy and strong support expressed by the socialist camp countries led by the Soviet Union for the just struggle of our people have given the Chinese people great encouragement, and the Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude for this fraternal friendship and support. Three days ago, Premier Zhou Enlai once again warned U.S. imperialism: "If U.S. imperialism insists on provoking a war for the aggression of Jinmen and Mazu, then the 600 million Chinese people, united as one, with the sympathy and support of the entire socialist camp and all peace-loving countries and people, will surely bring about the complete and utter failure of U.S. imperialism's aggressive actions." Premier Zhou's remarks once again fully expressed the Chinese people's determination to safeguard territorial sovereignty and defeat U.S. imperialist aggression.

At present, the socialist and communist construction of the socialist camp countries is developing rapidly at an unprecedented pace. The entire socialist camp is experiencing the great era that Marx predicted, "one day equals twenty years." The Chinese people have created tremendous achievements in socialist construction with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward. Catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years is not only fully confident, but can also be completed ahead of schedule. The great Soviet people are also striving to complete the basic economic task of the Soviet Union in ten to fifteen years, that is, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of per capita product output. Other socialist countries have also made great achievements in the development of industry and agriculture. As long as we better unite and support each other, we can make the production of our camp countries develop more rapidly. In this way, within a short historical period, the socialist camp can leave the imperialist camp far behind in the peaceful economic competition.

As Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech at the meeting: "Today, the great socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is more united and stronger than ever before. The great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the lofty ideal of building socialism and communism, and the firm will to defend world peace unite the people of all socialist camp countries like one person." On the occasion of the establishment of the friendship associations between our country and ten brother countries, let us cheer for the further development and strengthening of the friendship between our country and the socialist brother countries, and cheer for the great unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union!

### 为加强社会主义阵营的伟大团结欢呼

    为加强社会主义阵营的伟大团结欢呼
    当我们光荣的国庆节到来的前夕，中阿、中保、中匈、中越、中德、中朝、中蒙、中波、中罗、中捷等十个友好协会在北京同时宣告成立。这是在中苏友协成立多年，并有力地促进了中苏人民的友好合作之后，我国人民同社会主义兄弟国家人民发展友谊的重大事件。新的十个友好协会的成立，标志着我国人民同各兄弟国家人民的友好团结和互助合作关系的进一步加强。
    以苏联为首的亲如兄弟的社会主义阵营各国，一向是友好团结、互助合作的。社会主义国家是新型的国家，它们的相互关系也是新型的关系。社会主义阵营各国的相互关系首先是建立在马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义原则之上的，也是建立在完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则之上的。毛泽东同志曾经很高地估价这种关系说：“自从有历史以来，任何国家间的关系，都不可能像社会主义国家间这样休戚与共，这样互相尊重和互相信任，这样互相援助和互相鼓舞。”在社会主义阵营中，力量最强大、经验最丰富的苏联，一向给予各兄弟国家多方面的无私的援助。社会主义各国之间也互相援助，彼此合作。我国的社会主义建设一向得到苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的真诚援助；同时，我国人民也把各兄弟国家的社会主义和共产主义建设看成是社会主义阵营的共同事业，并且为这个事业而贡献自己的力量。我国人民同各兄弟国家人民一样，在社会主义建设和争取和平的斗争中，日益感到社会主义各国人民友好团结、互相支持的重大政治意义。
    社会主义阵营各国一向奉行和平外交政策，主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处，一向支持各国的民族独立运动和世界人民争取和平的斗争。团结一致、坚如磐石的社会主义阵营，是世界和平的坚强堡垒，是各国民族独立运动的强大支柱，是争取和平的各国人民的忠实的朋友。只要回顾一下最近几年的历史，我们就可以清楚地看到，社会主义阵营在维护世界和平方面发挥了多么卓越的作用。苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的政府和人民，以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民，共同扑灭了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家制造的在朝鲜和印度支那的战争。苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家人民，一致支持了埃及人民反抗英、法、以色列三国侵略的自卫战争和叙利亚人民反抗美国的侵略阴谋，一致支持了黎巴嫩和约旦人民反抗美英侵略和伊拉克人民反对美英威胁的斗争。最近一年来，苏联、波兰、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚和其他社会主义国家提出了一系列的和平建议，苏联首先停止了核武器试验，朝中两国政府共同决定从朝鲜撤退中国人民志愿军。所有这些事实，都表明了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。
    目前国际形势的特点是，东风继续压倒西风。社会主义阵营各国的社会主义和共产主义建设蒸蒸日上；亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动蓬勃发展；而在帝国主义阵营中，首先在资本主义最发达的美国发生了深刻而严重的经济危机；以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团空前孤立。这个形势十分有利于全世界人民争取和平的斗争。在这个形势下，社会主义阵营各国更进一步加强团结，将会对世界和平事业作出更多更大的贡献。
    以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，一向仇视社会主义阵营。它们不断对社会主义阵营进行诬蔑和造谣中伤，企图挑拨和破坏社会主义阵营各国的团结。它们不断叫嚣反苏反共和“解放东欧国家”；美国国会甚至通过所谓“共同安全”法，每年公开拨出成亿美元专门从事颠复社会主义阵营各国政权的罪恶活动。美帝国主义和它的伙伴们对社会主义阵营各国进行了长期的封锁和“禁运”。美帝国主义并且积极在社会主义阵营国家的周围建立一系列的军事基地，企图包围和侵犯苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家。然而，帝国主义对社会主义阵营的一切侵略和破坏活动都只能归于失败。美帝国主义发动的侵略朝鲜的战争和它支持的法国侵略越南的战争，以及美帝国主义策动的对匈牙利的颠复活动，都遭到了可耻的失败。中苏友好同盟互助条约和华沙条约，有力地捍卫了社会主义阵营的安全，捍卫了欧亚两洲和全世界的和平。
    今天，美帝国主义在中东进行侵略失败之后，又在台湾海峡地区向我国进行疯狂的军事挑衅和战争威胁，企图继续霸占我国领土台湾，并把侵略扩大到我国的沿海岛屿。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行的挑衅不仅是对我国人民的挑衅，而且也是对整个社会主义阵营的挑衅，是对世界和平的挑衅。美帝国主义的这种罪恶行为是我国六亿人民所不能容忍的，也是社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。赫鲁晓夫同志警告美国总统艾森豪威尔说：对中国的侵犯就是对苏联的侵犯，美国必须永远结束对中国的干涉，美国舰队必须撤离台湾海峡地区，美国兵必须离开台湾回家去。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国对于我国人民的正义斗争所表示的深切同情和有力支持，给予我国人民以极大的鼓舞，我国人民对于这种兄弟般的友谊和支持表示衷心的感谢。三天前，周恩来总理又一次警告美帝国主义说：“如果美帝国主义硬要为侵略金门、马祖而挑起战争，那么，团结一致的六亿中国人民，在整个社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持下，必将使美帝国主义的侵略行动最后遭到彻底的失败。”周总理的这番话，再一次充分表达了中国人民维护领土主权和击败美帝国主义侵略的决心。
    目前，社会主义阵营各国的社会主义和共产主义建设正在一日千里地迅速发展。整个社会主义阵营都在经历着马克思预言过的“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代。我国人民在社会主义建设中以大跃进的精神创造了巨大的成就。十五年内在主要工业产品产量方面赶上英国，不仅有充分的把握，而且可以提前完成。伟大的苏联人民也正在争取在十年到十五年的时间内完成苏联的基本经济任务，即在按人口平均的产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家美国。其他社会主义国家在发展工农业方面也取得了很大的成就。只要我们更好地团结和互相支持，就能使我们阵营各国的生产更加迅速的发展。这样，在一个短短的历史时期内，在和平经济的竞赛中，社会主义阵营就能把帝国主义阵营远远抛在后边。
    正如彭真同志在大会上的发言中指出的：“今天，以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，比任何时候都更加团结、更加壮大了。马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，建设社会主义和共产主义的崇高理想，保卫世界和平的坚定意志，把社会主义阵营各国人民团结得像一个人一样。”在我国同十个兄弟国家的友好协会成立的时候，让我们为我国同社会主义兄弟国家友谊的进一步发展和加强而欢呼，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结而欢呼！
