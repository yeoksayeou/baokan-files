Applying Dialectics: Achieving High Cotton Yields
Zhang Qiuxiang Manages Cotton Fields by Starting from Reality and Focusing on the Primary Contradiction

(Our Dispatch) China's first female peasant researcher—Zhang Qiuxiang, a famous cotton planting expert from Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, and her work team, dialectically utilized various technical measures in their cotton planting work this year, achieving a bumper cotton harvest.

Recently, the responsible comrades of the Weinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, along with the party and government cadres of the local people's commune and nearby masses, measured the yield of the 4.3 mu of high-yield cotton planted by Zhang Qiuxiang's work team. These cotton plants generally reached over four feet in height, with each plant having seventeen or eighteen fruit branches and bearing more than fifty bolls. Some cotton plants were over five feet tall, with twenty-four fruit branches and bearing more than one hundred bolls. Among them, one mu of cotton grew particularly well, with a total of 4,865 plants, bearing more than 291,900 bolls. After harvesting and testing, a total of more than 3,890 jin of seed cotton could be picked, which could be ginned into 1,556 jin of lint cotton. The remaining 3.3 mu yielded 1,280 jin of lint cotton per mu. This is the highest cotton yield record in Shaanxi Province currently.

Last autumn, when Zhang Qiuxiang's work team began to prepare the cotton fields, some team members were very dissatisfied with the cotton field that the commune had left for them. This was because the land used to be a village site, the soil quality was poor, it was prone to pests, it was far from the village, and irrigation was inconvenient. They asked the commune to reallocate a better piece of land. At that time, Zhang Qiuxiang disagreed with these people's views. Based on her years of practical experience in growing cotton, she told everyone about the dialectical relationship between land conditions and people's subjective initiative. She believed that the yield of crops was not entirely determined by land conditions. As long as people's subjective initiative was fully utilized, even bad land could grow good crops. Therefore, they carried out soil improvement according to the characteristics of this land. First, they applied sufficient base fertilizer and carried out deep plowing and winter irrigation early, so that the soil could be exposed to the sun for a long time and fully mature. This spring, they also carried out timely harrowing to preserve soil moisture. After the cotton seeds were sown, the seedlings emerged neatly and grew stronger than the cotton in the local good land, which improved the team members' confidence.

When guiding the team members in field management, Zhang Qiuxiang particularly emphasized the flexible application and interrelation of various technical measures. For example, when the cotton seedlings emerged, they were very dense. She believed that the longer they were crowded, the more nutrients and water they would consume, and the weaker the seedlings would grow. Therefore, they appropriately advanced the time for thinning and removing seedlings. However, later the weather suddenly turned cold, and the ground temperature dropped. In order to ensure that the cotton seedlings developed healthily, they postponed the time for setting the seedlings.

In early August, tasks such as intertillage, fertilization, irrigation, pruning, and pest control came all at once. Some team members could not distinguish between priorities and advocated taking a one-size-fits-all approach and carrying them out one by one. Zhang Qiuxiang said: When we carry out each technical measure, we must study its purpose and study which problem in cotton growth it is solving. Although various technical measures are interrelated, they are not parallel. We should distinguish between what is the main connection and what is the secondary connection. After research, everyone believed that the main problem in cotton growth at present was: how to control bud and boll shedding. At that time, the weather was relatively dry, and the cotton flowers were shedding a lot due to insufficient nutrient supply. For this reason, they first carried out irrigation work, combined with topdressing of chemical fertilizers before irrigation. However, because the cotton field area was large and the watering speed was very slow, they adopted the "yin-yang ditch" irrigation method, watering every other row to speed up the watering and ensure that all cotton seedlings received the nutrients and water they deserved in time. However, later there was more rain, and the phenomenon of bud and boll shedding still existed. After research, everyone realized that although nutrients and water were not lacking during this period, the cotton bolls were absorbing most of the nutrients because the pruning work had not kept up and the vegetative growth was too fast. Another reason was that the buds were not easily pollinated after being rained on, resulting in shedding. After that, they concentrated their efforts on pruning and removing branches, and timely shook off the rainwater in the flower boxes, so that the cotton quickly pollinated and formed bolls.

Zhang Qiuxiang's research on cotton cultivation technology not only frequently studies the connection between various technical measures, but also frequently observes new changes and new problems in production practice. She found that the vitality of the cotton itself has also undergone new changes this year due to changes in land conditions and cultivation technology. This year, the cotton flowered and budded ten days earlier than in previous years, and each cotton plant grew three more fruit branches and bore five more bolls than last year during the same period. In the past, due to limited land fertility, farmers did not dare to keep too many fruit branches and bolls. They adopted the method of "pinching the top and cutting the bottom" to control the development of cotton on the plane, leaving only thirteen or fourteen fruit branches on each cotton plant, with only two or three bolls on each fruit branch. This year, according to the new conditions, Zhang Qiuxiang boldly proposed to cultivate the development of cotton plants. However, this also brought many new problems: How to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission when the branches and leaves of cotton grow too densely? How to carry out intertillage work between cotton rows? How to further control bud and boll shedding? Because these problems could not be solved for a while, some team members advocated still adopting the method of passively restricting growth to inhibit the growth of cotton. In order to thoroughly solve these problems, Zhang Qiuxiang went to Shanxi and Hebei to visit local high-yield cotton and learned many advanced experiences. After returning, they combined the local situation to improve technology and adopted effective measures to leave eighteen to twenty fruit branches on each cotton plant, and the bolls on each fruit branch were also retained without restriction, up to sixteen at most. This set of successful experience has found a new way for high cotton yields in the future. (Wang Yong) (Attached picture)

    运用辩证法　亩产千斤花
    张秋香管理棉田从实际出发，抓主要矛盾
    本报讯　我国第一个农民女研究员——陕西省渭南县著名植棉能手张秋香和她的作务小组，今年在种植棉花的作务中辩证地发挥各种技术措施的作用，获得棉花丰收。
    最近，中共渭南县负责同志同当地人民公社党政干部和附近群众对张秋香作务组种植的四亩三分丰产棉花进行了测产。这些棉花一般株高达到四尺以上，每株有果枝十七、八个，结桃五十多个。有些棉花株高五尺以上，有二十四个果枝，结桃一百多个。其中有一亩棉花生长得特别好，共有四千八百六十五株，结桃二十九万一千九百多个。经收获测验，共可拾籽棉三千八百九十多斤，可轧皮棉一千五百五十六斤。其余三亩三分亩产皮棉一千二百八十斤。这是陕西省当前棉花产量的最高纪录。
    去年秋末，当张秋香作务组开始整理棉田时，有些组员对于社里给她们留下的这块棉花地，很不满意。因为这块地过去是个庄基地，土质不好，容易发生虫害，离村庄很远，灌溉也不方便。她们要求社里给重新调换一块较好的土地。当时，张秋香不同意这些人的看法。她以自己多年来种棉花的实际事例，向大家讲述土地条件和人的主观能动性的辩证关系。她认为：农作物的产量并不完全是由土地条件决定的，只要充分发挥人的主观能动性，坏地也可以长出好的庄稼。于是，她们根据这块地的特点进行了土壤改良。首先，施足了底肥，提早进行深耕和冬灌，使土壤得到长期曝晒，充分熟化。今春又及时进行了耙耱保墒。棉花下种后，幼苗出土整齐，比当地的好地棉花还生长得健壮，提高了组员们的信心。
    张秋香在指导组员进行田间管理时，特别强调各种技术措施的灵活运用和相互联系。如棉苗出土时，挤得很稠，她认为这样挤的时间越长，消耗的养分和水分越多，幼苗就越长越弱。因此，她们适当地提早进行间苗疏苗。可是后来天气忽冷，地温下降，为了保证棉苗发育健壮，她们又推迟了定苗时间。
    8月上旬，中耕、施肥、灌溉、打杈、防虫等工作一拥而来。有些组员分不出轻重缓急，主张采取一把抓的办法，逐项进行。张秋香说：我们进行每一项技术措施时，都要研究它的目的性，研究它是解决棉花生长中的哪个问题。虽然各项技术措施都是互相联系的，但又不是平列的，应该区别什么是主要联系，什么是次要联系。经过研究，大家认为当前棉花生长中的主要问题是：如何控制蕾铃脱落。当时，天气较旱，棉花因养分供应不上，花蕾脱落很多。为此她们首先进行灌溉工作，在灌溉前结合追施化肥。但因棉田面积大，浇水速度很慢，于是，她们采取了“阴阳沟”灌溉法，隔一行浇一行，加快浇水速度，保证全部棉苗及时得到应有的养分和水分。但后来雨多了，而蕾铃脱落现象仍然存在。经过研究，大家才认识到这一时期养分水分虽不缺乏，但因整枝工作没有赶上去，油条长得太快，棉桃应得的养分大部分被油条吸去了；另一个原因，是花蕾因雨浇过，不易受粉，形成脱落。此后，她们又集中力量进行整枝打杈工作，并及时摇掉花盒里的雨水，使棉花很快地受粉结铃。
    张秋香对务棉技术的钻研，不仅经常研究各种技术措施的联系，而且经常观察生产实践中的新变化和新问题。她发现今年的棉田由于土地条件和作务技术等条件的变化，使棉花本身的生命力也起了新的变化。今年棉花比往年提前十天开花现蕾，每个棉株在同时期内，比去年多长了三个果枝，多结了五个桃子。过去，农民务棉由于地力有限，不敢多留果枝和桃子，采取“长高掐低”的办法，控制棉花向平面发展，每棵棉株只留十三、四个果枝，每个果枝上只留两三个桃子。今年张秋香根据新的条件，大胆提出要培养棉株发展。但因此也带来了许多新问题：如棉花枝叶长得过于茂密，如何解决过风透光问题？棉花行间的中耕工作怎样进行？怎样进一步控制蕾铃脱落？由于这些问题一时得不到解决，有些组员便主张仍然采取消极限制的办法，抑制棉花的生长。为了彻底解决这些问题，张秋香曾去山西、河北参观当地的丰产棉花，学习了许多先进经验。回来后，她们结合当地情况改进技术，采取了有效措施，把每个棉株留了十八至二十个果枝，每个果枝上的桃子也不加限制地保留起来，最多留到十六个。这一套成功经验，为今后棉花高产找到了一个新的门径。　（王永）（附图片）
