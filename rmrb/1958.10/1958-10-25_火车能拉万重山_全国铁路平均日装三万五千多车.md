Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd. The national railways released a high-yield satellite for a continuous week from the 15th to the 21st. The average daily loading of cars this week reached 35,521, a leap of 16.9% compared to the daily average loading in the first two weeks of this month. This situation signifies that China's railway transportation has reached a new level.

This week, the national railway transportation department launched a vigorous mass movement. Under the encouragement of resounding slogans such as "More loading, fast running, quick loading and unloading" and "Get more cars from time", the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees soared to unprecedented heights. Trains loaded with coal, steel, machinery, grain and various materials, shuttled back and forth on various railway lines. Train drivers of the Guye Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau, on the six-thousandths grade line from Shanhaiguan to Guye, were pulling 3,400-ton freight trains, achieving a technical speed of 68 kilometers, an increase of more than 20 kilometers compared to normal. The drivers sang: "Heroes have lofty ambitions that reach the sky, what difficulty is there in treading mountains and crossing ridges, the slope is not as big as our ambition, flying trains can pull ten thousand mountains." The transportation organization work of many stations has been significantly improved. More than 600 of the 2,800 stations across the country had vehicle dwell times of no more than five hours. Shanhaiguan Station, a large marshalling station on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, adopted new operating methods, with vehicle transfer times of only one hour, which is much shorter than usual.

Under the leadership of the Party committees of various provinces, cities and autonomous regions, and with the strong support of the people of various localities, the national railways formed a loading and unloading army of nearly one million people, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, who fought day and night on the freight yards of various stations, ensuring fast loading, unloading and moving. Among the people loading and unloading, there were not only young pioneers and elderly women, but also passengers passing through the station.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient capacity on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Tianjin-Pukou main lines and the Nanjing Yangtze River Ferry, the State Economic Commission, in conjunction with relevant ministries, has studied and reduced some of the long-distance transportation of coal from north to south, and taken measures to improve the transportation capacity of these two lines, creating favorable conditions for railway transportation.

Cooperation between the railway department and various fraternal business sectors has also seen new developments. The Shenyang Railway Bureau promoted the experience of the Camel Camp Station of the Jinzhou Bureau in cooperating with factories and mines, and carried out comprehensive cooperation with Anshan Iron and Steel Company, unifying the scheduling and use of transportation equipment. Anshan Iron and Steel provided 600 freight cars to support railway transportation.

In order to consolidate and expand the gains from this high-yield satellite and maintain the high-yield record, railway workers across the country have launched a red flag ten-day competition for loading cars, starting on October 22nd.

### 火车能拉万重山  全国铁路平均日装三万五千多车

    火车能拉万重山
    全国铁路平均日装三万五千多车
    新华社23日讯　全国铁路在15日到21日放出持续一周的高产卫星。这一周日装车数平均达到三万五千五百二十一车，比这个月头两周的日平均装车量跃增了16.9％。这一情况标志着我国铁路运输达到了新的水平。
    这一周，全国铁路运输部门掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。在“多拉快跑快装快卸”、“向时间要车”等响亮口号的鼓舞下，广大职工战斗热情空前高涨。一列列的满载煤炭、钢铁、机械设备、粮食和各项物资的超重列车，像穿梭一般地在各个铁路线上奔驰。北京铁路局古冶机务段的火车司机在山海关到古冶的千分之六的坡道线路上，牵引着三千四百吨的货物列车，技术速度达到了六十八公里，比平常提高了二十多公里。司机们高唱：“英雄志高高上天，踏山越岭有何难，坡道那有雄心大，飞车能拉万重山”。许多车站的运输组织工作有了显著的改进。全国二千八百多个车站，有六百多个车站车辆停留时间不超过五小时。京沈铁路上的大编组站——山海关车站采取新的作业方法，车辆中转时间只有一个小时，比平常缩短了很多。
    在各省、市自治区党委的领导下，和在各地人民的大力支援下，全国铁路组成了一支包括工农兵学商的近百万人的装卸大军，不分白天黑夜，在各个车站的货场上奋战，保证了快装、快卸、快搬。在装卸的人们中不仅有红领巾、老大娘，还有过站的旅客。
    为了解决京广、津浦两大干线和南京长江轮渡通过能力不足问题，经国家经济委员会会同有关各部研究，压缩了一部分由北往南的煤炭长距离运输，并采取措施提高这两条线的运输能力，给铁路运输创造了有利条件。
    铁道部门同各个兄弟企业部门的协作也有了新的发展。沈阳铁路局推广锦州局骆驼营车站同厂矿协作的经验，同鞍山钢铁公司进行全面协作，统一调度和使用运输设备。鞍钢拿出六百辆货车，支援铁路运输。
    为了巩固和扩大这次获得高产卫星的战果，使高产纪录继续保持下去，全国铁路职工从10月22日起又开展了装车红旗旬的竞赛。
