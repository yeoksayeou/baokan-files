    Chinese and Japanese People Unite to Deal with Common Enemy

    Following the joint statement by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Japan "Sohyo" (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) delegation to China, the joint statement by the National Committee of the First Machine Building Trade Union of China and the Japan Central Metal Struggle Council delegation to China, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and other three people's organizations, along with the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation to China, and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, together with the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China delegation to China, also issued joint statements on October 10th and 11th respectively. The parties signing these two joint statements reached a consensus on issues such as opposing the United States' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait region and promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. This fully reflects the determination of the Chinese people and peace-loving Japanese people to strengthen their efforts to oppose American imperialism's aggression and promote friendship between the two peoples. We wholeheartedly support these statements.

    Since the beginning of September, peace-loving people in various parts of Japan have launched a magnificent "Month of Action" to open up Sino-Japanese relations and oppose American war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region. This "Month of Action" has clear goals: on the one hand, to oppose the US imperialist policy of aggression and war in the Far East, demanding that the United States withdraw its aggressive troops from the Taiwan area, the Japanese mainland, and Okinawa; on the other hand, to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of reviving militarism, implementing nuclear armament, and being hostile to China. In their struggle for independence and peace, the peace-loving people of Japan have increasingly clearly realized that the main threat to peace in the Far East and the world comes from the aggressive policies of US imperialism; and that the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following the United States, being hostile to China, and reviving Japanese militarism is dragging the Japanese people to the brink of disaster. Therefore, it is no accident that this "Month of Action" has been able to develop rapidly and deeply since its launch, with more and more Japanese people enthusiastically joining this struggle.

    Judging from the speeches made by people from all walks of life in Japan during this "Month of Action," their understanding, attitude, and determination regarding this struggle are consistent with the remarks made by the Japanese delegations visiting our country. They unanimously stated that the Japanese people have recognized that US imperialism is the enemy of the Japanese people and also the enemy of the Chinese people. Therefore, in order to effectively safeguard peace in the Far East and Asia, the Chinese and Japanese people must further join hands and unswervingly oppose this common enemy. As Mr. Kazami Akira said, more and more Japanese people realize that the United States is not a friend of Japan, but an enemy that uses Japan. The Japanese people's demand for the withdrawal of American troops from the Japanese mainland and Okinawa, and the Chinese people's demand for the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan, reflect the consistent demands and common struggle of the two peoples. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the Japanese people enthusiastically support the Chinese people's just struggle for the liberation of their own territory. Mr. Matsumoto Jiichiro's words also express this sentiment of the Japanese people. He said: "We are determined to treat the Taiwan Strait issue as our own issue and fight for Japan's independence and peace in Asia."

    As the peace-loving people of Japan deepen their understanding of the common struggle between the Chinese and Japanese people, the calls for Kishi Nobusuke to thoroughly change his policy of hostility towards China and to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations are also growing louder day by day. Despite the fact that the Kishi Nobusuke government has consistently adopted a policy of hostility towards China, the Japanese people have still worked hard to develop friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. This year, the Japanese people sent more than sixty representatives to visit our country during our National Day, which fully demonstrates that the trend of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be stopped by the heinous American imperialism and any reactionary forces.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government, a docile tool of the Japanese monopoly capital group, slavishly follows the United States and openly opposes the Chinese people, is the culprit in pursuing the US war policy and undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. It must be pointed out that the reactionary activities of the Japanese monopoly capital group have reached a very dangerous level today. The Kishi Nobusuke government is following the path of West Germany, stepping up the revival of militarism and intensifying its plans to relive its old imperialist dreams. The Kishi Nobusuke government wants to obtain some superficial "consideration" from its American masters in revising the Japan-US "Security Treaty" to decorate its dilapidated facade, thereby deceiving the Japanese people, and is accelerating the revival of militarism through a series of activities such as purchasing American missiles to implement nuclear armament and changing the "Defense Agency" to the "Ministry of National Defense." Its set of latent imperialist tricks is nothing more than to further rearm Japan and bind Japan to the American war chariot for aggression in the Far East. The result of the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of this policy of reviving imperialism will inevitably be the further fascization of domestic policy and intensified attacks on the Japanese people. In Sino-Japanese relations, it will inevitably become more hostile to the Chinese people. Recently, representatives of Japanese monopoly capital openly advocated the "Taiwan Merger Theory," openly plotting a "Taiwan Referendum" aimed at merging Taiwan into Japan, vainly attempting to get involved in our country's territory of Taiwan. What is very infuriating is that, following the incidents of insulting our national flag in Nagasaki and Yokohama, a third incident of insulting our national flag occurred in Tokyo on October 10th. The Japanese fascist organization "Greater Japan Patriotic Party" openly gathered more than 500 party members at Shinbashi Station in Tokyo to hold a "Rally to Encourage the Taiwanese People to Oppose Communism." Asanuma Michio, one of the heads of this fascist organization, also publicly burned our national flag. This incident is very serious and by no means accidental. It is inseparable from the ambitions of the Japanese monopoly capital group to try to get involved in Taiwan and the Kishi Nobusuke government's insistence on a policy of hostility towards China. It is said that the Japanese police authorities have arrested one or two thugs. The Chinese people are watching with incomparable indignation how the Kishi Nobusuke government will deal with this new incident of insulting our national flag!

    Our people express sympathy and concern for the "Month of Action" currently being carried out by the Japanese people. The relevant people's organizations in our country expressed the will and determination of the Chinese people to fight together with the Japanese people in their joint statement. Mr. Matsumoto Jiichiro said it well: A joint statement is a joint oath. This sentence is very well said. We are grateful for the friendship shown to the Chinese people by the representatives of the peace-loving people of Japan. At the same time, we know that the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people is the ferocious and insidious American imperialism, so this struggle will inevitably be arduous and long-term. Moreover, according to our people's past experience in struggle, unity is the basic guarantee for winning the struggle against imperialism. The Japanese people are also increasingly aware that only by uniting all the people, regardless of party, class, or belief, and working together to build a great national unity, can the struggle against American imperialist aggression, promoting friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, and striving for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations continue to develop and be victorious. The "National Rally to Open Up Japan-China Relations and Prohibit Nuclear Armament" held on October 8th showed that representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and various people's organizations gathered together and took joint action under common struggle goals and common demands. This shows that today, the desire of the Japanese people to take broad and consistent action has become a universal trend. This united struggle of the Japanese people is constantly developing. Not only has the Socialist Party put forward a clear "basic policy to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations," the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic relations with China, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and other people's organizations are actively carrying out this struggle, and even some people within the Liberal Democratic Party are increasingly dissatisfied with Kishi Nobusuke's policy of hostility towards China. We wish the Japanese people's "Month of Action" even greater success, and we hope that the Japanese people can show greater unity.

    With the development of the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, peace, and democracy, American imperialism and the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government will inevitably intensify their ruthless suppression and persecution of the Japanese people. However, the more reactionary the Kishi Nobusuke government becomes, the more isolated it will become, and the more it will suffer. Similarly, as long as the American aggressors do not withdraw from Japan, and as long as they rampantly oppress the Japanese people, the Japanese people will continue to tighten the noose around America's neck. Today, the American imperialism and its running dog, the Kishi Nobusuke government, are in an extremely isolated situation. If they stubbornly refuse to change their policies of oppressing the Japanese people and being hostile to the Chinese people, they will definitely not end well!

### 中日两国人民团结对付共同的敌人

    中日两国人民团结对付共同的敌人
    继中华全国总工会和日本“总评”访华代表团的联合声明、中国第一机械工会全国委员会和日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团的联合声明之后，中国人民对外文化协会等三个人民团体同日中友好协会访华代表团、中国人民外交学会同日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团，又于10月10日和11日分别发表了共同声明。签署这两个共同声明的双方，都就反对美国在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅、促进中日两国人民友好等问题，取得了一致的意见。这充分地反映了中国人民和爱好和平的日本人民为反对美帝国主义侵略及促进中日两国人民友好而加强努力的决心。我们衷心地支持这些声明。
    从9月初以来，日本各地爱好和平的人民掀起了一个气势雄壮的打开中日关系和反对美国在台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅的“运动月”。这个“运动月”的目标鲜明，一方面反对美帝国主义在远东实行侵略和战争的政策，要求美国撤出它在台湾地区、日本本土和冲绳的侵略军队；一方面反对岸信介政府复活军国主义、实行核武装和敌视中国的政策。日本爱好和平的人民在争取独立、争取和平的斗争中，日益明确地认识到：远东和世界和平的主要威胁，是来自美帝国主义的侵略政策；而岸信介政府执行追随美国、敌视中国和复活日本军国主义的政策，正把日本人民拖到灾难的边缘。因此，这个“运动月”自从展开以来，得以迅速地深入地发展，有越来越多的日本人民热情地投身到这一斗争中来，决不是偶然的。
    从这个“运动月”期间日本各阶层人士发表的讲话来看，他们对这一斗争的认识、态度和决心，是和来我国访问的日本代表团的言论相一致的。他们一致表示，日本人民已经认清美帝国主义是日本人民的敌人，也是中国人民的敌人，因此为了有效地保障远东和亚洲的和平，中日两国人民必须进一步携起手来，坚持不懈地反对这个共同的敌人。正如风见章先生所说，愈来愈多的日本人民认识到，美国并不是日本的朋友，而是利用日本的敌人。日本人民要求美国军队撤出日本本土和冲绳，同中国人民要求美国军队撤出台湾，反映了两国人民的一致要求和共同的斗争。因此，日本人民热情支持中国人民为解放自己领土而进行的正义斗争，是完全可以理解的。松本治一郎先生的话也表明了日本人民的这种心情。他说：“我们决心为了日本的独立和亚洲的和平，把台湾海峡的问题，作为我们自己的问题来进行斗争。”
    随着日本爱好和平的人民对于中日两国人民共同斗争认识的加深，要求岸信介彻底改变敌视中国政策，打开中日关系僵局的声浪也一天比一天高涨。尽管岸信介政府始终采取敌视中国的政策，但是日本人民还是努力发展了中日两国人民的友好关系。今年日本人民派遣了六十多位代表在我国国庆节期间前来我国访问，就充分说明了中日人民友好的潮流，是穷凶极恶的美帝国主义和任何反动势力也阻挡不了的。
    日本垄断资本集团的驯顺工具、奴颜婢膝地追随美国和露骨地敌视中国人民的岸信介政府，是追随美国战争政策，破坏中日人民友好的罪魁。必须指出，今天日本垄断资本集团的反动活动，已经达到了非常危险的地步。岸信介政府正在走西德的道路，加紧复活军国主义，加紧重温帝国主义旧梦的部署。岸信介政府想在修改日美“安全条约”中由美国主子取得若干表面上的“照顾”，来装璜其破落门面，借以欺骗日本人民，并通过购买美国导弹以实行核武装，把“防卫厅”改为“国防省”等一系列活动，加紧复活军国主义。它耍的这一套潜在帝国主义的把戏，无非是要进一步重新武装日本，把日本缚上美国侵略远东的战车。岸信介政府实行这种复活帝国主义政策的结果，必然是使国内政策进一步法西斯化，变本加厉地向日本人民进攻。而在中日关系上，它必然更加敌视中国人民。最近日本垄断资本的代表人物公开鼓吹“台湾合并论”，公开策动目的在把台湾合并到日本的“台湾公民投票”的阴谋，妄图染指我国领土台湾。非常令人气愤的是，继长崎、横滨两地发生侮辱我国国旗事件之后，10月10日在东京又出现第三次侮辱我国国旗的事件。日本法西斯组织“大日本爱国党”公然在东京的新桥车站啸聚五百多党徒，大开什么“反共鼓励台湾国民大会”。这个法西斯组织的头子之一浅沼美智雄还当众烧毁了我国国旗。这个事件非常严重，而且决非偶然，它是同日本垄断资本集团企图染指台湾的野心和岸信介政府坚持敌视中国的政策分不开的。据说，日本警察当局已经逮捕了一两个暴徒。中国人民正在怀着无比激愤的心情，注视着岸信介政府如何发落这桩新的侮辱我国国旗的事件！
    我国人民对于日本人民目前开展的“运动月”表示同情和关切。我国有关的人民团体在共同声明中表示了中国人民对中日两国人民共同斗争的意志和决心。松本治一郎先生说得好：共同声明就是共同誓言。这句话说得很好。对日本爱好和平人民的代表对中国人民所表示的友谊，我们是感谢的。同时，我们知道，中日两国人民的共同敌人是如此凶恶阴险的美帝国主义，因此，这一斗争必然是艰巨的、长期的。而且根据我国人民过去斗争的体验，团结是反对帝国主义斗争致胜的基本保证。日本人民也日益认识到，只有不分党派，不分阶级，不分信仰，合力同心建立起全民的大团结，反对美帝国主义侵略、促进中日人民友好和争取恢复中日邦交的斗争才能不断地获得发展和胜利。10月8日召开的“日本打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会”表明，日本社会党、日本共产党及各人民团体代表济济一堂，在共同的斗争目标和共同的要求下采取了联合的行动。这说明了今天日本全国人民要求广泛一致行动的愿望，已经成为普遍的趋势。日本人民的这一联合斗争正在不断地发展着。不仅社会党已经提出明确的“打开日中关系僵局的基本方针”，日本的工会总评议会、日中恢复邦交国民会议、日中友协等人民团体积极开展这一斗争，就是自由民主党内也有一部分人日益不满岸信介的敌视中国的政策。我们预祝日本人民的这个“运动月”能取得更大的胜利，并且希望日本人民能显示出更大的团结。
    随着日本人民争取民族独立、和平、民主斗争的开展，美帝国主义和岸信介反动政府，必然更加穷凶极恶地镇压和迫害日本人民。但是，岸信介政府越是反动，就越会孤立，就越要倒霉。同样，只要美国侵略者一日不撤出日本，只要它越发猖狂地欺压日本人民，日本人民就会不断地拉紧套在美国脖子上的绞绳。今天处于极端孤立境地的美帝国主义及其走卒岸信介政府，如果死不改变压迫日本人民和敌视中国人民的政策，就一定不会有好下场！
