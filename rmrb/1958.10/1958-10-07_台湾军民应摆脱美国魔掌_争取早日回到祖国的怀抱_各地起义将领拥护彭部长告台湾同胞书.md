Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 6th. Many uprising generals in Sichuan Province, upon seeing Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots today, expressed their support and hoped that the military and civilians in Taiwan would, based on Minister Peng Dehuai's letter, hold negotiations and implement a peaceful resolution.
    Liu Wenhui, a Kuomintang uprising general, the first convener of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and vice chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said in a statement: "Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots, suggesting a peaceful negotiation to resolve the Taiwan issue, expresses the common desire of the 600 million people of China, and I fully support it." Liu Wenhui said: "Minister Peng's letter is a powerful blow to the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism and points out a clear direction for the struggle of the military and civilians in Taiwan. I hope that the military and civilians in Taiwan, under the banner of patriotism, with the spirit of patriotism as one family, will respond to the call, promote the early realization of peaceful negotiations, complete the reunification of the motherland, and at the same time, the military and civilians in Taiwan can break free from the clutches of the American aggressors and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible." Deng Xihou, Kuomintang uprising general and vice governor of Sichuan Province, said in a statement: "The affairs of the Chinese people should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. It has nothing to do with the United States in the Eastern Pacific. Friends in Taiwan should quickly negotiate based on Minister Peng Dehuai's letter. Now the motherland's industry and agriculture are leaping forward, and it has rapidly embarked on the bright road to prosperity, isn't this what we all have been hoping for for many years? Friends in Taiwan, since the motherland has extended a hand of peace to you, don't miss this opportunity. I hope you will make a decisive decision so that Taiwan can be peacefully liberated as soon as possible, and you can return to the embrace of the motherland." Huang Yin, an uprising general, former commander of the Kuomintang 95th Army, and vice chairman of the Chengdu Municipal Political Consultative Conference, said in a statement: "Minister Peng Dehuai said it well, we are all Chinese. Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, reconciliation is the best. I hope that old friends in Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu, and Kinmen will seize the opportunity, respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call, consciously take action, and instigate your leaders to conduct negotiations, so as to peacefully liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, complete the unification of the country, and stop following the American imperialists. They will eventually abandon you."
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 6th. Former Kuomintang army uprising generals in Wuhan, at a gathering to discuss Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots today, unanimously agreed that Minister Peng Dehuai's proposal to implement a peaceful resolution on the issues of Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and other coastal islands is a golden opportunity for Kuomintang army officers and soldiers to awaken and return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Chen Kefei, member of the Hubei Provincial People's Committee and former Lieutenant General Commander of the Kuomintang 12th Army Corps, said that under the powerful military might of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, when the Chiang Kai-shek group is at the end of its rope, lingering on its last breath, and unable to maintain itself, 600 million Chinese compatriots are extending a call to them, suggesting negotiations and implementing a peaceful resolution. This opens the door to survival for Kuomintang army officers and soldiers. This is truly a great act of the Communist Party's magnanimity and not dwelling on past grievances.
    Peng Jieru, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Hunan Provincial Security Command, said that reactionary forces who have historically relied on imperialism to betray the motherland have never had a good end. History has proven that those who seek survival by relying on the whims of American imperialism will eventually be kicked away by American imperialism. He hopes that Kuomintang army officers and soldiers should, based on the patriotic and familial stance, take advantage of this great opportunity and no longer act as cannon fodder for the American aggressors. They should join the people of the whole country in jointly dealing with the American imperialist robber dogs who are invading China.
    All the uprising generals who spoke advised Chiang's army officers and soldiers to carefully consider their future during the People's Liberation Army's cessation of shelling and to consider what the end would be if they sold their lives for American imperialism. They hoped that they would repent as soon as possible, stand on the side of the Chinese people, and strike at the American aggressors. Li Minghao, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, former Lieutenant General Director of the Kuomintang Huangpu Military Academy Second Branch, Fang Tun, former Lieutenant General Commander of the Chiang Army's 18th Army, Chen Li, Lieutenant General Deputy Commander of the 45th Army, and more than ten others also spoke at today's meeting.

    台湾军民应摆脱美国魔掌  争取早日回到祖国的怀抱
    各地起义将领拥护彭部长告台湾同胞书
    新华社成都6日电　四川省的许多起义将领今看到彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书以后，都表示拥护，并且希望台湾的军民同胞根据彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书，举行谈判，实行和平解决。
    国民党起义将领、民革四川省委员会第一召集人、四川省政协副主席刘文辉发表谈话说：“彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书，建议用和平谈判的方式，解决台湾问题，表达了全中国六亿人民的共同意愿，我完全拥护。”刘文辉说：“彭部长这一篇告台湾同胞书，对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，给予有力的打击，并为台湾军民指
  出奋斗的明确方向。我希望台湾军民在爱国主义的旗帜下，本着爱国一家的精神，响应号召，促使和平谈判早日实现，完成祖国的统一，同时台湾军民也得摆脱美国侵略者的魔掌，早日回到祖国怀抱。”国民党起义将领四川省副省长邓锡侯发表谈话说：“中国人民的事应该由中国人自己来解决。与东太平洋的美国毫不相干。台湾的朋友们应该根据彭德怀部长的信很快来进行谈判。现在祖国工农业大跃进，已经迅速走上富强的光明大道，这不是我们大家过去多年所期望的吗？台湾的朋友们，祖国既已向你们伸出了和平的手来，你们不要错过这个机会，希望当机立断，使台湾早日和平解放，而你们也得以回到祖国怀抱。”起义将领、原国民党九十五军军长、成都市政协副主席黄隐发表谈话说：“彭德怀部长说得好，我们都是中国人，三十六计，和为上计，我希望处在台湾、澎湖、马祖、金门的旧日朋友们，应该不失时机，响应彭德怀部长的号召，自觉的行动起来，策动你们的领导者进行谈判，以期早日和平解放台湾，完成国家的统一，不要再跟着美国帝国主义者跑了，他们是终久会抛弃你们的。”
    新华社武汉6日电　在武汉的前国民党军队起义将领今天在座谈彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书的集会上，一致认为彭德怀部长提出的就台湾、金门、马祖等沿海岛屿问题实行和平解决的建议，对国民党军队官兵来说是一个幡然悔悟重回祖国怀抱的良机。
    湖北省人民委员会委员、前国民党十二兵团中将司令陈克非说，在中国人民解放军强大军事威力下，蒋介石集团走投无路，苟延残喘，无以维持的时候，六亿中国同胞向他们伸出召唤之手，建议举行谈判实行和平解决，这对国民党军队官兵开了生路之门，这真是共产党宽大为怀不念旧恶的伟大举动。
    全国政协委员、前国民党湖南省保安司令部副司令彭杰如说，历来依靠帝国主义出卖祖国的反动派都没有一个好下场，历史已经证明那些仰美帝国主义鼻息求生存的人，到后来必将被美帝国主义一脚踢开。他希望国民党军队官兵们应本着爱国一家的立场，趁着这个大好时机，不要再为美国侵略者当炮灰了，应和全国人民一道，共同对付侵略中国的美帝国主义狗强盗。
    所有发言的起义将领，在发言中都劝蒋军官兵在解放军停止炮击期间，好好考虑自己的前途，考虑一下为美帝国主义卖命有什么下场。希望他们及早悔悟，站到中国人的立场上，打击美国侵略者。在今天会上发言的还有湖北省副省长、前国民党黄埔军校第二分校中将主任李明灏、前蒋军十八军中将军长方暾、四十五军中将副军长陈离等十多人。
