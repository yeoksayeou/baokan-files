Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 11th. Our front-line reporter Lin Junqing reported the battle scene of our air force heroes shooting down three Chiang Kai-shek planes: At 7:00 a.m. on the 10th, when the heroic People's Liberation Army was strictly implementing Minister Peng Dehuai's order to suspend the shelling of Kinmen, six F-86 American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes sneaked into the airspace over the Sandu'ao and Longtian areas of Fujian.

Soon, on a certain front-line airport, a green signal flare rose, and our air force fleet took off. Seeing the situation was not good, two enemy planes attempted to circle from south to north to escape. Our planes immediately saw through the enemy's trick and set up a confusing formation to lure the enemy in deeper. At 7:20 a.m., the two sides met, and initially two enemy planes tried to attack our plane No. 1, but our plane No. 3 immediately rushed forward to support, scaring the enemy plane to swerve to the left and turn behind plane No. 3, but it was immediately pursued by plane No. 1. Our plane No. 4 took advantage of the situation to chase after it, biting onto an enemy plane, and after a burst of fire, the enemy plane fell to the ground. Plane No. 4 then hit another enemy plane, turning it upside down. The other four enemy planes were chased by our fleet into disarray, circling wildly in the sky. When the enemy planes desperately hid in the clouds, vainly attempting to escape, plane No. 4, which had already shot down two enemy planes, chased after them again, and a series of shells hit another enemy plane, which fell into the sea southeast of Pingtan, emitting black smoke.

The two or three minutes of air combat ended with three enemy planes destroyed, and the remaining three fled in a panic. Our brave war eagles returned safely.

    两三分钟空战　击落三架敌机
    新华社福建前线11日电　本社前线记者林俊卿报道我空军健儿击落蒋机三架的战斗情景称：10日七时，英勇的解放军正在严格执行彭德怀部长的命令，暂停炮击金门的时候，六架F—86型美制蒋机，贼头贼脑地窜扰我福建三都澳和龙田地区上空。
    不久，前线某机场上，升起了绿色信号弹，我空军机群腾空而起。这时两架敌机见势不妙，企图从南向北绕个圈子逃跑。我机立即识破了敌人的诡计，摆下了一个迷魂阵，诱敌深入。七时二十分，两机相遇，开始两架敌机想偷击我机一号机，我三号机立即抢前策应，吓得敌机往左一拐，转向三号机后面，但它立即受到一号机的追击。我四号机乘势追来，咬住了一架敌机，一阵射击，这架敌机应声跌落尘埃。四号机接着又命中另一架敌机，把它打成个倒栽葱。另四架敌机，被我机群追得乱了队形，在天空直打圈子。当敌机慌张地躲进云层，妄图逃命时，已经击落敌机两架的四号机，又驱机追来，一串炮弹又击中了一架敌机，这架敌机冒着黑烟，坠入平潭东南的大海里。
    两三分钟的空战，结束了三架敌机，其余的三架狼狈逃去。我神勇的战鹰，安然返航。
