    Guinea: A New Independent Country in Africa
    A new independent country has emerged in Africa. On October 2nd, the people of Guinea in French West Africa declared independence and established the Republic of Guinea, after voting to reject De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution" on September 28th. This is another new victory for the national independence movement.
    French West Africa has always been inhabited by Black people. As early as the thirteenth century, they established their own countries in areas such as Senegal. From the fifteenth century onwards, merchants from Portugal, Britain, and France successively invaded West Africa, plundering gold, ivory, and spices, and engaging in the slave trade. French colonialists invaded West Africa in 1895 and successively divided the West African regions into French colonies by 1909.
    French West Africa was the collective name for eight territories: Senegal, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, French Sudan, Niger, Mauritania, and Upper Volta. In order to ease the struggle of the African people for independence, the French colonialists promulgated the Basic Law for Overseas Territories in February of last year, granting "local autonomy" to French Black Africa and other places, and establishing so-called "semi-autonomous republics" in French West Africa. According to the "autonomy" decree, French West Africa established parliamentary and governmental committees in each territory under the exclusive administrative power of the French High Commissioner.
    The people of French West Africa were not deceived by "autonomy" and continued their struggle for independence. In this struggle, the African Democratic Rally, initiated and organized in 1946 by anti-colonial activists from French West Africa and French Equatorial Africa, played a significant role. In the March 1957 territorial assembly elections in French Guinea, the Guinea Democratic Party (the local Guinean organization of the African Democratic Rally) won 56 of the sixty seats and formed the territorial government. The current Prime Minister of Guinea, Sekou Touré, is the chairman of the Guinea Democratic Party.
    When De Gaulle went to Guinea in August to promote his dictatorial "constitution," the people of Guinea held demonstrations demanding immediate independence. The Prime Minister of Guinea pointed out to De Gaulle: "We are willing to maintain a union with France, but in this union, we must be free, dignified, and autonomous people." Although De Gaulle used intimidation tactics, he did not intimidate the people of Guinea. In the vote on September 28th this year, the people of Guinea chose the bright path of independence, and they cast an overwhelming vote against De Gaulle's dictatorial constitution.
    The newly independent Republic of Guinea was originally a wealthy territory of French West Africa, with an area of approximately 100,000 square miles and a population of approximately 2.5 million. The capital is Conakry.

### 非洲新的独立国家——几内亚

    非洲新的独立国家——几内亚
    非洲又出现了一个新的独立国家。9月28日，法属西非的几内亚人民投票拒绝接受戴高乐的独裁“宪法”后，于10月2日宣布了独立，成立几内亚共和国。这是民族独立运动的又一新的胜利。
    法属西非洲一直是黑人居住的地方。他们早在十三世纪时就在塞内加尔等地区建立了自己的国家。从十五世纪起，葡萄牙和英法等国商人相继侵入西非洲，掠夺黄金、象牙和香料，贩卖黑奴。法国殖民者于1895年侵入西非，于1909年先后把西非各地区划为法国殖民地。
    法属西非是塞内加尔、法属几内亚、象牙海岸、达荷美、法属苏丹、尼日尔、毛里塔尼亚和上伏尔达等八个领地的总称。法国殖民者为了缓和非洲人民争取独立的斗争，于去年2月颁布了海外属地基本法，给予法属黑非洲等地以“地方自治”，在法属西非洲建立所谓“半自治共和国”。根据“自治”法令，法属西非洲在法国高级专员独揽行政大权下，在各领地设立议会和政府委员会。
    法属西非洲人民不受“自治”的欺骗，继续进行争取独立的斗争。在这一斗争中，法属西非洲和法属赤道非洲反殖民主义活动家，在1946年发起组织的非洲民主联盟，起着重大的作用。在法属几内亚1957年3月举行领地议会选举时，几内亚民主党（即非洲民主联盟几内亚地方组织）取得了六十个议席中的五十六席，并组成了领地政府。现任几内亚总理杜尔就是几内亚民主党的主席。
    当戴高乐于8月到几内亚推销他的独裁“宪法”时，几内亚人民就曾举行示威，要求立即独立。几内亚总理向戴高乐指出：“我们愿意保持与法国的联合，但是在这一联合中我们必须成为自由、自尊与自主的人民”。戴高乐虽然使用恐吓的伎俩，但是他没有吓倒几内亚人民。在今年9月28日的投票中，几内亚人民选择了光明的独立道路，他们给戴高乐独裁宪法投了压倒的反对票。
    刚获得独立的几内亚共和国，原是法属西非洲的一个富庶的领地，面积约十万平方英里，人口约二百五十多万。首府科纳克里。
