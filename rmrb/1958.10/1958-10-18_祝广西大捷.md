In the great battle to double steel production over the past month or so, we have successively congratulated Guizhou and Henan on their great victories and congratulated various parts of the country on launching "satellites" before National Day. Today, our hearts are with the comrades in Guangxi on the southern border of the motherland. There, two "large satellites" have soared into the sky: one is that Huanjiang County produced more than 63,000 tons of pig iron on October 15th; the other is that Xincheng County mined more than 670,000 tons of coal on October 14th (see this newspaper on the 17th).

These two high-yield records are unprecedented miracles in history! Not long ago, we were waiting for the emergence of counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron; now, not only have counties with a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron emerged, but even counties with a daily output of more than 60,000 tons of pig iron have emerged. Not long ago, we were also waiting for the emergence of counties with a daily output of 10,000 tons of coal; now, not only have counties with a daily output of tens of thousands of tons of coal emerged, but even counties with a daily output of more than 600,000 tons of coal have emerged. Many advanced indicators that were once considered bold enough have been abandoned behind by the rocket-like pace of life in a matter of days or dozens of days. "One day equals twenty years" – what a heroic slogan! However, on October 15th, the people of Huanjiang County produced pig iron equivalent to about one hundred years of Guangxi's output before liberation! In our era, how much value can the people create in a day, equivalent to how many years in history, is really a difficult problem for even the greatest mathematicians to solve.

The great victory in Guangxi once again demonstrates the power of the mass movement. In 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report "Get Organized!" that there are two approaches to leading production. One approach is to "organize the masses, mobilize and organize all the people's strength, all the strength of the troops, organs, and schools, all the able-bodied and semi-able-bodied labor, men and women, young and old, without exception, as long as it is possible, and make them a labor army." The other approach is to "lack a mass viewpoint, not rely on the masses, not organize the masses, not pay attention to organizing the broad masses of the countryside, troops, organs, schools, and factories, but only pay attention to organizing a small number of people in financial organs, supply organs, and trade organs; not regard economic work as a broad movement, a broad front, but only regard it as a temporary means to remedy financial insufficiency." The great victory in Guangxi is precisely the result of mobilizing the masses and organizing steel production and coal production into "a broad movement, a broad front." As everyone knows, Guangxi's steel production and coal production are quite backward compared to other regions in the country. The industrial foundation that history left to the people of Guangxi is very weak. Guangxi wants to achieve a great leap forward in steel and coal production, and the conditions are much worse compared to many other provinces and autonomous regions. However, they insisted on carrying out mass movements, which solved many difficulties. More than three million people in the region went to the steel front, and some county towns became "empty cities," with 60 to 70 percent of the people fighting in the mines and by the furnaces. Such a broad movement, a broad front, first made Guangxi's pig iron production report frequent victories. At the end of September, news of daily output of thousands of tons from counties such as Luocheng came, a few days ago news of a daily output of more than 17,000 tons from Nandan County came, and recently news of a daily output of more than 60,000 tons from Huanjiang County came. This is not a sudden event, but an inevitable result of the invincible and unconquerable mass movement under the leadership of the Party. In the past, Guangxi mainly used charcoal for iron smelting. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that in order to ensure the steel production plan, it is necessary to go to the mountains to cut trees; but in order to fundamentally solve the fuel problem of steel production, it is also necessary to increase coal production and carry out mass movements in coal production. Soon, there were frequent reports of victories again. First, Liucheng County produced 80,000 tons of coal per day, and now Xincheng County produces more than 670,000 tons of coal per day. This is also not an accidental event, but an inevitable result of demonstrating the great mass movement. With such a broad movement, a broad front, and two "large satellites" launched in pig iron production and coal production, we believe that Guangxi will definitely be able to launch a "large satellite" in steel production as well.

Of course, carrying out mass movements is not an easy task, and the first thing to solve is the ideological problem of cadres. What new ideological problems are now hindering us from carrying out mass movements on a large scale on the steel front? It seems that the main problem is that some comrades believe that with such a tight labor force now, mobilizing tens of millions of people to the steel front will delay agricultural production. Therefore, they either hesitate to lead their troops to the steel front, or their bodies are by the furnace, but their hearts are in the fields. In this way, either the strength on the steel front is weak, and it is difficult to make a leap forward; or there are many people with divided minds, and nothing can be accomplished. Guangxi also encountered similar ideological problems in the mass movement of vigorously developing steel production. Under the leadership of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, various parts of Guangxi organized a great debate on this issue, unified their thinking, and made everyone realize that putting so much manpower into the steel front and vigorously developing the mass movement of steel production is not to put other work aside, but to make other work leap forward better. Because on the one hand, as long as there is steel, the agricultural tools and agricultural machinery needed for the great leap forward in agriculture, the materials needed for large-scale water conservancy projects, and the raw materials needed for the great leap forward in industry will be guaranteed, and a larger-scale comprehensive leap forward next year will be possible; on the other hand, only by achieving a decisive victory on the steel front in October can more people be drawn into the agricultural front when the autumn harvest and autumn planting season arrives in November. This consistent understanding is an important reason why the mass movement of steel production in Guangxi is unstoppable.

For other provinces and regions, the situation is certainly not exactly the same. Most provinces and regions have autumn harvest and autumn planting seasons earlier than Guangxi, and the contradiction in labor force arrangement will be more serious when developing both steel and agriculture at the same time. What should be done? One approach is to withdraw from the steel front and not engage in any mass movements, but to let a small number of people in the metallurgical industry department work alone. Doing so will certainly not delay the farming season; but if steel production cannot be increased, what will be relied on for another leap forward next year? This is obviously a hindrance, not a promotion. Another approach, which is also the correct approach, is to work with both hands, and no front should be withdrawn. Mass movements should be vigorously carried out in both steel and agriculture. Technological revolutions should be vigorously carried out on the steel front to improve efficiency and save manpower; technological revolutions should also be vigorously carried out on the agricultural front to improve efficiency and save manpower. Both sides should be taken into account and advance side by side. Doing so is certainly not without difficulties, but it is entirely possible to do so. Didn't Henan Province win battles on both the steel front and the agricultural front?

The great victory in Guangxi has erected a new red flag for us. We extend warm congratulations to the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi, and hope that the people of Guangxi will continue their efforts, consolidate their existing achievements, and strive for greater victories. We also hope that all provinces and autonomous regions in the country will continue to vigorously develop the mass movement of steel production and will never give up until a complete victory is won!

### 祝广西大捷

    祝广西大捷
    在一个多月来的为钢产翻一番的伟大战斗中，我们曾先后祝贺过贵州、河南大捷，祝贺过国庆前夕全国各地大放“卫星”。今天，我们的心向着祖国南疆的广西的同志们。那里，有两颗“大卫星”腾空而起：一是10月15日环江县产了六万三千多吨生铁；一是10月14日忻城县采了六十七万多吨煤炭（见17日本报）。
    这两个高产纪录，都是历史上从未有过的奇迹！不久以前，我们曾等待着日产生铁千吨县的出现；现在，不但日产生铁万吨的县出来了，连日产生铁六万多吨的县也出来了。不久以前，我们也曾等待着日采煤炭万吨县的出现；现在，不但日采煤炭数万吨的县出来了，连日采煤炭六十多万吨的县也出来了。许多曾经被认为已经是够大胆的先进指标，在几天、几十天的时间里，都被像火箭一样飞驰的生活抛弃在后面了。“一天等于二十年”，这是多么豪迈的英雄的口号！但是，环江县人民在10月15日这一天中，却生产了约等于解放前广西一百年的产量的生铁！在我们时代的人民，一天究竟能够创造多少价值，等于历史上的多少年，可真是任何最伟大的数学家也解答不出的难题。
    广西大捷，再一次显示了群众运动的威力。1943年，毛泽东同志在“组织起来”的报告中早就指出，领导生产有两种方针。一种方针是“把群众组织起来，把一切老百姓的力量、一切部队机关学校的力量、一切男女老少的全劳动力半劳动力，只要是可能的，就要毫无例外地动员起来、组织起来，成为一支劳动大军”。另一种方针是“缺乏群众观点，不依靠群众，不组织群众，不注意把农村、部队、机关、学校、工厂的广大群众组织起来，而只注意组织财政机关、供给机关、贸易机关的一小部分人；不把经济工作看作是一个广大的运动，一个广大的战线，而只看作是一个用以补救财政不足的临时手段”。广西大捷，正是发动群众，把钢铁生产和煤炭生产组织成“一个广大的运动，一个广大的战线”的结果。大家知道，广西的钢铁生产和煤炭生产比之于全国其他地区，是相当落后的。历史遗留给广西人民的工业基础是非常薄弱的。广西要在钢铁和煤炭生产上来一个大跃进，同其他许多省和自治区比较起来，条件要差得多。但是，他们坚持搞群众运动，使得许多困难迎刃而解。全区有三百多万人开赴钢铁前线，有些县城变成“空城”，百分之六、七十的人都到矿山和炉边战斗去了。这样一个广大的运动、广大的战线，首先使广西的生铁生产捷报频传。9月底传来了罗城等县日产千吨的捷报，几天前传来了南丹县日产一万七千多吨的捷报，最近又传来了环江县日产六万多吨的捷报。这不是什么突然的事情，而是党领导下的无坚不摧、无攻不克的群众运动的必然的结果。广西炼铁过去主要用木炭。中共广西僮族自治区委员会一方面指出为了保证钢铁生产计划，要上山砍树；但为了根本解决钢铁生产的燃料问题，也要增产煤炭，在煤炭生产上搞群众运动。不久，果然又是捷报频传。先是柳城县日产八万吨煤炭，现在是忻城县日产六十七万多吨煤炭。这也不是什么意外的事情，而是展示伟大的群众运动的必然的结果。有了这样一个广大的运动、广大的战线，在生铁生产上和煤炭生产上放出了两颗“大卫星”，我们相信，在炼钢生产上，广西也一定能放出“大卫星”来。
    搞群众运动当然不是一件容易的事情，首先要解决干部思想上的问题。现在又有些什么新的思想问题障碍着我们在钢铁战线上大搞群众运动呢？看来，主要是有些同志认为：现在劳动力这么紧张，动员几千万人到钢铁战线上去，会耽误农业生产。因而他们或则迟迟不愿率领人马奔赴钢铁前线，或则人在炉边，心在田里。这样，要不就是钢铁战线上实力单薄，难有跃进；要不就是人多心不齐，干不出什么名堂来。广西在大搞钢铁生产的群众运动中，也曾遇到类似的思想问题。在中共广西僮族自治区委员会的领导下，广西各地就这个问题组织了大辩论，统一了思想，使大家认识到把这么多的人力投入钢铁战线，大搞钢铁生产的群众运动，不是为了把别的工作搁下，而是为了把别的工作更好地跃进。因为一方面，只要有了钢铁，农业大跃进需要的农具和农业机械，大规模水利工程需要的器材，工业大跃进需要的原材料，才有保证，明年更大规模的全面大跃进才有可能；另一方面，也只有10月份在钢铁战线上取得决定性的胜利，才能在11月秋收、秋种的季节来到时，抽出比较多的人来转入农业战线。这种一致的认识，是广西钢铁生产的群众运动锐不可当的重要原因。
    对于别的省、区说来，情况当然不完全相同。大部分省区秋收秋种的季节都比广西早一些，同时大搞钢铁和农业，在劳动力安排上矛盾会更严重一些。怎么办呢？一种做法是，从钢铁战线上撤退，不搞什么群众运动了，还是由冶金工业部门的少数人去单干。这样做，固然不致于误了农时；但钢铁不能增产，明年再跃进靠什么？这显然是促退，不是促进。另一种做法，也是正确的做法是：左右开弓，哪一条战线也不撤退。钢铁要大搞群众运动，农业也要大搞群众运动。钢铁战线上要大搞技术革命，提高效率，节省人力；农业战线上也要大搞技术革命，提高效率，节省人力。双方兼顾，齐头并进。这样做当然不是没有困难，但却是完全可以做到的。河南省不是在钢铁战线上和农业战线上都打胜仗的吗？
    广西大捷，为我们竖了一面新的红旗。我们遥向广西各族人民表示热烈的祝贺，希望广西人民再接再厉，巩固已有的成就，争取更大的胜利。我们还希望全国各个省和自治区把钢铁生产的群众运动继续轰轰烈烈地发展下去，不获全胜，誓不罢休！
