(Our Newspaper) Beijing News – The Soviet National Swimming Team and Water Polo Team made their last two friendly matches in China in Beijing on the afternoon of the 19th and the evening of the 20th. In the sixteen competitions between the Soviet swimming team and the Chinese youth team, the Soviet team won thirteen first places. In the two matches, the Soviet water polo team defeated China's Guangzhou team and Xiamen team with scores of 11-4 and 13-1, respectively.

Chinese swimming star Mu Xiangxiong won two first places for the Chinese team. In the first day's competition, he defeated Vladimir Minashkin, the Soviet world record holder in the men's 100-meter breaststroke, by an inch, with a time of 1 minute 11.7 seconds, only 0.2 seconds slower than the official world record held by Minashkin. Minashkin's score that day was 1 minute 11.8 seconds. Minashkin, who is tall and has powerful stroking action, had been keeping three or four inches ahead of Mu Xiangxiong. In the last five meters, the two sprinted side by side towards the finish line. Mu Xiangxiong made several quick leg-squeezing movements, finally gaining a tenth of a second to take first place.

In the second day's competition, Mu Xiangxiong again defeated current European champion Kolesnikov in the 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2 minutes 40.2 seconds. This is currently the third best result in the world. Australian Guthercole's best result is 2 minutes 36.5 seconds; Kolesnikov set a time of 2 minutes 39.3 seconds in July this year.

The other first place won by the Chinese youth team was the men's 100-meter butterfly, with Chen Yunpeng leading with a score of 1 minute 4.3 seconds.

In the two-day competition, athletes of the Chinese youth team also broke national records in the women's 400-meter freestyle relay, women's 100-meter freestyle, women's 400-meter freestyle, men's 100-meter butterfly, women's 100-meter breaststroke, and women's 400-meter medley relay.
