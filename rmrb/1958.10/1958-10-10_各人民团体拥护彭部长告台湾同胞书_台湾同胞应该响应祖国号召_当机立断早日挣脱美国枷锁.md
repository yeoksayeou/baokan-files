Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Responsible individuals of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Youth Federation issued statements endorsing Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots and expressed their hope that Taiwan compatriots will make a decisive decision and break free from the shackles of American imperialism as soon as possible.

    The responsible person of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, representing the national employees, wholeheartedly endorsed Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots. He said that this is a humanitarian measure and a patriotic call. He hoped that compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu would break free from the shackles of American imperialism as soon as possible, respond to the call of the great motherland, and make every effort to promote negotiations to resolve internal disputes peacefully. He also said that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu have been an inseparable part of our country's territory since ancient times. There is only one China in the world, not two Chinas. The Chinese people must liberate their own territory. This is China's internal affair and will not allow interference from American imperialism. The Chinese working class resolutely opposes the American imperialism's scheme of playing "ceasefire" and creating "two Chinas."

    Cai Chang, chairperson of the All-China Women's Federation, said: Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots fully expresses the wishes of all women on the mainland and represents the interests of women in Taiwan. She hoped that the sisters in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu would actively respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call and urge their relatives to value peace and prioritize patriotism, quickly unite, take action, oppose our common enemy American imperialism, peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue, and realize the complete unification of the motherland's territory as soon as possible. Only by taking this path and adopting this method can Taiwan compatriots get rid of their humiliating and impoverished lives, return to the embrace of the motherland, and obtain a happy life of peace and prosperity.

    Responsible individuals of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation also expressed the hope in their talks that Taiwan compatriots would recognize the situation and make decisive decisions. They said that our suspension of shelling Jinmen is by no means a sign of weakness. The Chinese people and youth have the strength to liberate their motherland's sacred territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu and the strength to defeat any invaders. Currently, the Chinese people and youth are launching a nationwide armed movement, ready at all times to eliminate any enemies who dare to invade.
