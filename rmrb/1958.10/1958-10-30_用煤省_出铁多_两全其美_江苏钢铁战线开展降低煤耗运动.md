    Saving Coal and Producing More Iron: Two Goals Achieved Simultaneously
    Jiangsu Steel Front Launches Coal Consumption Reduction Campaign
    (Our newspaper Nanjing, October 29th, reporter Shi Yue'e) To overcome the difficulties of tight coal supplies, a mass movement to reduce coal consumption is underway on the steel front throughout Jiangsu Province. The Provincial Party Committee requires that, in the high-yield and abundant production movement, the coal consumption of indigenous furnaces (the ratio of ore to coal) be reduced to below 1:4, and the coal consumption of foreign blast furnaces be reduced to below 1:2.

    Recently, Wuxi, Suzhou, Nanjing and other places have already created new records of producing more iron while saving coal. The No. 1 experimental furnace of Shenxin Textile Factory in Wuxi City achieved a new record on the 9th of this month of consuming only 1.77 jin of coal to produce one jin of iron. The Suzhou Minfeng Boiler Factory, which once set the national record for the highest utilization coefficient of indigenous blast furnaces, recently had a 1-cubic-meter indigenous blast furnace create a new coal-saving record of 0.576:1 (0.576 jin of coal per jin of iron ore). A 3-cubic-meter small blast furnace at the Xuanwu District High-Speed Steel Plant in Nanjing produced 6.35 tons of iron on October 5th, with a fuel-to-ore ratio of 0.666:1.

    These new records of low coal consumption and high iron output are the flowers of political leadership and technological revolution. The Party Committee of Shenxin Textile Factory in Wuxi City organized a large-scale debate in front of the furnace, debating "whether or not to increase the proportion of ore and reduce coal consumption?" This unified understanding and inspired the masses' confidence in technological innovation, quickly breaking through the technical barrier to saving coal. Wuxi City was the first to successfully use coal dust and ore fines to make coal balls and ore balls for iron smelting. Changzhou, Suzhou and other places immediately sent people to study and promote it. Suzhou Dongfeng Steel Plant further used mixed ore balls and mixed coke made of ore fines and coal dust to smelt iron. Chen Renliang, a technician from the Fifth Battalion of the Zhoupu Steel Regiment in Nanhui County, successfully used Dongshan coal dust to directly smelt iron in a 0.18-cubic-meter small blast furnace. From 8:00 on the 1st to 17:00 on the 6th, a total of 1,044 kilograms of iron were smelted, with the highest furnace output reaching 69 jin. This is a major technological innovation that has emerged in the coal consumption reduction campaign.

    Various places have also promoted the method of preheating and roasting ore. This method can not only reduce coal consumption, but also shorten smelting time and prolong the life of the furnace. (Attached chart)

### 用煤省　出铁多　两全其美  江苏钢铁战线开展降低煤耗运动

    用煤省　出铁多　两全其美
    江苏钢铁战线开展降低煤耗运动
    本报南京29日电　记者史越峨报道：为了克服煤炭供应紧张的困难，江苏全省钢铁战线上正在开展一个降低煤耗的群众运动。省委要求，在高额丰产运动中，要把土炉煤耗（矿石同煤的比例）降低到一比四以下，洋高炉煤耗降低到一比二以下。
    最近，无锡、苏州、南京等地都已经创造了出铁多、用煤省的两全其美的新纪录。无锡市申新纺织厂一号试验炉在本月9日做到了出一斤铁只需耗用一点七七斤煤。曾经创造全国土高炉利用系数最高纪录的苏州市民丰锅厂，最近有一座一立方公尺的土高炉，创造了零点五七六比一（一斤铁矿石比零点五七六斤煤）的省煤新纪录。南京市玄武区高速钢铁厂一座三立方公尺的小高炉10月5日日产六点三五吨铁，燃料和矿石的比例是零点六六六比一。
    这些煤耗低、出铁多的新纪录，是政治挂帅和技术革命的花朵。无锡市申新纺织厂党委组织了炉前大辩论，辩论“要不要，能不能增加矿石比重，降低煤耗？”统一了认识，激励了群众革新技术的信心，很快就打破了省煤技术关。无锡市首先用煤屑、矿屑制成煤球、矿球炼铁成功，常州、苏州等地立即派人去学习并加以推广。苏州东风钢铁厂进一步用矿屑、煤屑做成的混合矿球和混合焦，炼出了铁。南汇县周浦钢铁团五营技术员陈仁良，在零点一八立方公尺的小高炉上试用东山煤屑直接炼铁成功。从1日八时至6日十七时，共炼出铁一千零四十四公斤，最高炉产量达六十九斤。这是在降低煤耗运动中出现的一项技术上的重大创举。
    各地还推广了矿石预热焙烧的方法。这种办法不但可以降低煤耗，还可缩短冶炼时间，延长炉子寿命。（附图表）
