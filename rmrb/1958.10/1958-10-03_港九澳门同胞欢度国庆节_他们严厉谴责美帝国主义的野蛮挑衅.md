Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 1st: Encouraged by the glorious achievements of the motherland's socialist construction, the number of compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon participating in various National Day celebrations this year has doubled compared to last year.

At 11:00 a.m., more than 5,000 representatives from all strata of society in Hong Kong and Kowloon successively arrived at the Jinling Restaurant in the Western District of Hong Kong to hold a joint celebration meeting for the 1958 National Day for all circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The representatives participating in this meeting were more extensive than any previous session.

Gao Zhuoxiong, Chairman of the Presidium of the meeting, said in his speech: Today, the motherland has made unprecedented great achievements in the cause of socialist construction, and its international prestige is constantly improving. This makes the legitimate rights and interests of our Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots even more guaranteed. We must support the motherland's socialist construction with practical actions. Liang Weilin, Director of the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency, gave a detailed account of the motherland's achievements in all aspects and the reasons for these achievements, and condemned the U.S. imperialist military provocations against our country, exposing the U.S. conspiracy to play the so-called "ceasefire" trick. He said: Our Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against our territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. If imperialism dares to launch a war against China, the result will only be complete failure and destruction.

Chen Yaocai, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, Zheng Tieru, General Manager of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, Fei Yimin, Director of the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao", and barrister Chen Pishi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, also spoke at the meeting.

From September 26th, compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon began celebrating National Day, and these activities will continue until October 7th. More than 3,000 representatives from more than 100 trade unions participated in the National Day celebration meeting held by workers from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon tonight, an increase of one-third compared to last year.

The Hong Kong Fujian Chamber of Commerce, Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, Fujian Sports Association and other Fujian people's organizations and relatives of overseas Chinese, more than 1,000 people, jointly held a National Day celebration meeting last night.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting General Association, an organization of Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers, held a joint celebration meeting at noon today with more than 300 farmer representatives participating. Eleven agricultural areas including Kowloon, Yuen Long, Sha Tin, and Tsuen Wan have held separate celebration meetings before the festival.

The education sector, the industrial and commercial sector, the news and publishing sector, the film and drama sector, the shipping sector, the financial and trade sector, the photography sector, scientific and technical workers, art workers, students, women, and public organizations from all walks of life have held grand celebration meetings and dinners in recent days. Street public in six districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon also held various forms of celebrations for the first time.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 1st: Compatriots from all walks of life in Macao held a National Day celebration meeting tonight, with more than 1,400 representatives from all walks of life participating.

He Xian, Chairman of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, after reporting on the achievements of the motherland's all-round Great Leap Forward this year, angrily condemned the U.S. aggressors' military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area. He said: The Chinese people cannot be deceived. Whoever dares to invade China will be met with a devastating blow. Liang Pei, Chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, said: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, actually used missiles to attack our People's Air Force. This is an extremely serious event. Macao workers are very angry about this. We unanimously demand that the Chiang bandits be given a punitive blow. Ma Wanqi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Qinghui, Chairman of the Macao Women's Federation, Feng Jiao Sheng, Chairman of the Student Union, and heads of various public organizations also unanimously expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan and recover the Jinmen and Mazu Islands.
