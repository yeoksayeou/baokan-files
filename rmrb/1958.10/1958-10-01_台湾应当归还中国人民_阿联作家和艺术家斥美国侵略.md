Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch: According to TASS, Cairo, October 29th: Writers and artists in the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic issued a statement here pointing out: "The imperialist policies pursued by the United States in the Far East and the Middle East are not only a threat to the security of the People's Republic of China and Arab countries, but also a threat to world peace."

The statement said: "We declare that the occupation of Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, by the United States military and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and the continuous provocations and troop deployments by the United States to obstruct the liberation of this Chinese territory, are all blatant violations of the principles of the United Nations and infringements upon the sovereignty of other peoples."

The statement added: "We are very clear that the aggressive stance of the United States on the Taiwan liberation issue is directly related to its policies towards Lebanon and Jordan. American troops still occupy Arab land to this day. The United States, disregarding the unanimous resolution passed by the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, continues to delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon. The United Kingdom, pursuing the same policy, also refuses to withdraw troops from Jordan."

The statement pointed out: "The imperialist policy pursued by the United States is the cause of international tensions. Because of this policy, nuclear tests that endanger mankind continue to this day; because of this policy, high-level meetings have been obstructed from being held; because of this policy, no disarmament agreement has been reached and the principle of peaceful coexistence has not been recognized, although only peaceful coexistence can ensure peace and international cooperation."

The statement demanded: "Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese people, and the People's Republic of China should occupy its legitimate seat in the United Nations and the Security Council. The United States and the United Kingdom should immediately implement the resolutions of the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly and withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan."

The statement was signed by two hundred and fifteen writers and artists in the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, including Ihsan Quddus, the editor-in-chief of the "Rouz El Youssef" weekly.

    台湾应当归还中国人民
    阿联作家和艺术家斥美国侵略
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社开罗29日讯：阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区的作家和艺术工作者在这里发表声明指出：“美国在远东和中东所奉行的帝国主义政策，不仅对中华人民共和国和阿拉伯国家的安全是一个威胁，而且对世界和平也是一个威胁。”
    声明说：“我们声明，美国军队和蒋介石卖国集团窃据中国领土不可分割的部分台湾，美国为了阻挠这块中国领土的解放而不断进行挑衅和集结军队，这些行为都粗暴地破坏了联合国原则和侵犯了别国人民的主权。”
    声明又说：“我们十分清楚，美国在台湾解放问题上的侵略立场同它对黎巴嫩和约旦的政策有着直接的联系。美国军队直到现在仍然占领着阿拉伯的土地。美国不顾联合国大会紧急会议一致通过的决定，继续拖延从黎巴嫩撤兵。英国奉行同样的政策也拒绝从约旦撤兵。”
    声明指出：“美国奉行的帝国主义政策是造成国际局势紧张的原因。由于这种政策，直到现在还继续着危害人类的核试验；由于这种政策，高级会议一直受阻未能举行；由于这种政策，直到现在还没有达成裁军协议和承认和平共处的原则，虽然只有和平共处才能确保和平和国际合作。”
    声明要求：“台湾应当归还中国人民，中华人民共和国应当占有自己在联合国和安全理事会中的合法席位。美国和英国应当立即履行联合国大会紧急会议的决议，把军队撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。”
    在声明上签名的有阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区的二百一十五名文学家和艺术工作者，其中有“鲁兹·优素福”周刊的总编辑伊赫桑·库多斯等。
