Agriculture as the Foundation, Industry Also as the Foundation
Shaoxing Party Criticizes Small-Scale, Short-Term Thinking, Launches Large-Scale Iron and Steel Industry

(Reported by Zhejiang Daily) The party organizations and all cadres in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, through repeated debates, criticized the idea of "agriculture as the foundation, industry as secondary" and temporary views on running the iron and steel industry, firmly established the idea of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and taking steel as the key link, which led to the rapid development of pig iron production.

The county only produced more than 289 tons of iron in September. On October 8, the daily output of pig iron soared to 761 tons, and another 467 tons of sintered iron were produced. Six people's communes in the county also produced more than 100 tons of iron per day.

Shaoxing County started its iron and steel industry in August. At that time, the county party committee leadership mainly focused on agriculture, with only one deputy secretary of the county party committee in charge of industry and steel. In mid-September, the county party committee studied the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Based on the principle of vigorously developing the iron and steel industry while not relaxing agriculture, it was decided that the first secretary and two deputy secretaries of the county party committee would be in charge of the iron and steel industry, and the other two deputy secretaries would be in charge of agriculture. It was also stipulated that leading cadres from the county party committee to each commune should personally take command of the iron and steel industry. However, at this time, the thinking of many leading cadres below the county level had not changed, and they had not effectively grasped the iron and steel industry. The general thinking of district and township cadres was: engaging in agriculture is their main job, engaging in steel is an extra burden, and they were afraid that engaging in steel would affect agricultural production. Therefore, the county party committee immediately organized all cadres in the county to conduct a great debate. During the debate, many people cited facts to illustrate the relationship between developing the iron and steel industry and realizing the long-term plan of the people's commune, and refuted the argument that "engaging in the iron and steel industry will affect agricultural production."

With the deepening development of the large-scale iron and steel industry movement, the county party committee continuously paid attention to solving new ideological problems. When the iron production blitz was launched on September 29, the county's pig iron production increased, but it was far from the original plan. After analysis, the county party committee believed that a very important reason for this phenomenon was that some cadres had temporary views on running the iron and steel industry, and after working for a period of time, they wanted to withdraw. In early October, in response to this situation, the county party committee further organized cadres to debate the question: "Should the iron and steel industry be carried out on a large scale or a small scale? Should it be a 'long-term effort' or a 'short-term effort'?" After the debate began, the focus of the debate was: Should industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification be realized at high speed? If so, it must be done on a large scale, not a small scale; it must be done for a long time, not a short time. In this regard, the facts of the Qunying People's Commune gave everyone a profound inspiration. Before September, due to the existence of small-scale and "short-term" thinking, the commune did not have much enthusiasm, and as a result, it only produced 360 jin of pig iron in dozens of days. Later, after criticizing these ideas, more than 4,000 workers, farmers, students, and shop assistants in the commune were mobilized to quickly build more than 1,000 earthen furnaces and transport more than 4,000 tons of ore. After a few days, the commune's daily output of pig iron suddenly increased to more than 100 tons. Through the debate, the cadres of the people's commune mostly established the idea of running the iron and steel industry on a long-term and large scale, and fixed a part of the labor force transferred to the iron and steel front as a standing force for steel production.

Now, the county's iron and steel army of more than 100,000 people, composed of workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants, is fighting day and night in front of the furnaces, mines, and transportation lines. In view of the fact that the furnace construction work has been basically completed, the county party committee is making every effort to grasp production and actively strengthen the management of the furnace groups, and universally implement the "five-determination system of 'determining furnace groups, determining cadres, determining workers, determining tasks, and determining three materials'," so that production gradually moves towards planning and normalization.

    农为本工亦为本
    绍兴全党批判小干短干思想大办钢铁工业
    据浙江日报报道　浙江省绍兴县的党组织和全体干部经过反复辩论，批判了“以农为本，以工为副”的思想和对办钢铁工业的临时观点，坚定地树立了工农业并举和以钢为纲的思想，使生铁生产有了迅速的发展。
    这个县9月份只产生铁二百八十九吨多，10月8日，生铁日产量激增到七百六十一吨，另外还生产了烧结铁四百六十七吨。全县还有六个人民公社日产铁百吨以上。
    绍兴县办钢铁工业是从8月份开始的。当时，县委领导主要是抓农业，只有一个管工业的县委副书记抓钢铁。9月中旬，县委学习了中共中央政治局扩大会议的精神，根据大办钢铁工业同时不放松农业的原则，确定由县委第一书记和两位副书记抓钢铁工业，另外两位副书记管农业，并且规定从县委到每一个公社，领导干部都要亲自挂帅抓钢铁工业。但是，这时许多县以下的领导干部一时思想转不过来，还没有把钢铁工业切实地抓起来。区、乡干部普遍的思想情况是：搞农业是自己的本行，搞钢铁是额外负担，生怕搞了钢铁会影响农业生产。县委于是立即组织全县干部大鸣大放大辩论。在辩论中，许多人列举事实，说明了发展钢铁工业和实现人民公社远景规划的关系，批驳了“搞钢铁工业会影响农业生产”的论调。
    随着大办钢铁工业运动的深入发展，县委不断地注意解决新的思想问题。在9月29日开展产铁突击战时，全县生铁产量虽有增长，但离原订计划相差很远。县委分析后认为，出现这种现象的一个很重要的原因是，有些干部对办钢铁工业存在着临时观点，在干了一段时间之后，就想收兵回营。10月初，县委针对这种情况，进一步组织干部辩论这样一个问题：“办钢铁工业是大干还是小干？是‘长干’还是‘短干’？”辩论展开后，争论的焦点是：要不要高速度实现工业化和农业机械化、电气化？要，就必须大干，不能小干；就必须长干，不能短干，在这方面，群英人民公社的事实给了大家很深刻的启示。这个社在9月份以前，由于存在着小干、“短干”的思想，劲头不大，结果几十天只生产出三百六十斤生铁。后来批判了这些思想以后，发动社内工人、农民、学生、店员四千多人迅速建成一千多座土炉，运来四千多吨矿石，几天之后全社生铁日产量就猛然增加到一百多吨。通过辩论，人民公社的干部大都树立了长期大办钢铁工业的思想，把抽调到钢铁战线上的一部分劳动力固定下来，作为钢铁生产的常备队伍。
    现在，全县由工农兵学商组成的十几万人的钢铁大军，正不分昼夜地奋战在炉前、矿山和运输线上。县委鉴于建炉工作已经基本完成，正全力以赴大抓生产，积极加强对炉群的管理，普遍实行“定炉群、定干部、定工人、定任务、定三料”的五定制度，使生产逐步走向计划化、正常化。
