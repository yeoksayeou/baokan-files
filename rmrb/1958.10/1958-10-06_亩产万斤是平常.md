    Ten Thousand Jin Per Mu is Commonplace
    The iron tree blossoms after a thousand years,
    Conservative thoughts are greatly liberated,
    Grain production increases greatly from now on,
    Ten thousand jin per mu is commonplace.
            ——Anhui

    亩产万斤是平常
    千年铁树开了花，
    保守思想大解放，
    粮食从此大增产，
    亩产万斤是平常。
            ——安徽
