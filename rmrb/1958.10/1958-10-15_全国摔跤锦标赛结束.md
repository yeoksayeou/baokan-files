    全国摔跤锦标赛结束
    新华社天津13日电在天津举行的1958年全国摔跤锦标赛，经过九天，七百五十多场的激烈争夺，13日闭幕。八个级别的冠亚军是：次最轻量级冠军高富桐（天津）、亚军李兰田（山西）；最轻量级冠军王恩信（天津）、亚军钱德仁（北京）；次轻量级冠军张毛清（山西）、亚军王鸿书（天津）；轻量级冠军贾福才（天津）；亚军胡和阿尔斯楞（内蒙古）；次中量级冠军老来（内蒙古）、亚军崔福海（山西）；中量级冠军刘生才（辽宁）、亚军徐茂（北京）；次重量级冠军杨子明（天津）亚军陈金泉（北京）；重量级冠军拉玛（内蒙古）亚军胡胡勒（内蒙古）。从这次比赛中可以看到，摔跤运动已经在我国普遍开展起来。参加这次比赛的一百八十五名运动员，都是经过二十五个省（市）、自治区选拔出来的，其中大部分是新手，但他们在耐力和技术上普遍比1956年全国摔跤锦标赛时有了显著提高。
    这次比赛中，很多运动员表现了卓越的技巧，能够利用机会、时间、方法、力量四方面结合的条件战胜对方。
