Steel Flows from the Rehabilitation Center

It was late at night on August 9th, and people were already asleep. But the steelmaking furnace at the Henan Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers' Rehabilitation Center was still blazing fiercely. Two blowers hummed, sending air into the furnace. More than a dozen disabled soldiers, working as steelmakers, were sweating profusely from the intense heat of the furnace. Zhou Yunlong, the steelmaking team leader, supporting himself on crutches, watched the melting steel with both excitement and anxiety. He thought, this is the fourth steelmaking trial.

Ten days ago, when he and eleven other disabled soldiers received the steelmaking task, they were both happy and anxious. Happy because it suited their wishes, and anxious because they were afraid of not being able to make steel. He thought to himself, steelmaking is completely new to us. We have never even seen it before, let alone done it. How can we make steel? Then he thought, difficulties are dead, people are alive. As long as we want to do it, nothing is impossible. So he took his hand-cranked tricycle and went out to learn steelmaking experience. In the initial construction of the furnace, they used green bricks instead of firebricks, and mobilized the masses to collect cylinder sand and fire clay when they didn't have them. If they didn't know how to build a furnace, they built an earthen furnace underground. After several days and nights of hard work, the first steelmaking furnace was finally built on July 31st, and steelmaking began. Unexpectedly, after three furnaces, all the results were failures. At this time, Zhou Yunlong was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. He couldn't eat or sleep, and walked around the furnace opening on his crutches, carefully examining it. Suddenly, he noticed a small piece had collapsed on the furnace wall. When he poked it with a stick, some of the green bricks inside had already melted. He immediately mobilized the masses to thicken the furnace wall and start refining again. Then another tense furnace building began. Qiao Keming, who had been ill for a long time, took the lead in building the furnace, while Ma Xinglong and Ren Heping, who were disabled in both legs, hurried to cut scrap iron. Zheng Yougong, the president of the rehabilitation center, also came to participate in the work. After preparation, that night, the flames in the steelmaking furnace were burning again. In a burst of tense blower noise and the roar of the furnace fire, the fiery red steel flowed out of the crucible, sparks flying, illuminating the earth red.

After the steel cooled, the results of the analysis by the Xinxiang Municipal Bureau of Industry proved that this furnace of steel fully met the standard of first-class high-quality steel. Zhou Yunlong happily said: "There is nothing mysterious about steelmaking. As long as you have the determination, you can make steel. We plan to produce eight tons of high-quality steel for the country by the end of this year to support national industrial construction."

    教养院钢水奔流
    8月9日深夜，人们都已入睡了。可是河南省革命残废军人教养院的炼钢炉还在冒着熊熊的火焰，两部吹风机嗡嗡地往炉里送风，十几个炼钢的残废军人，被强烈的炉火烤得汗流浃背，连夜守在炉旁的炼钢队长周云龙，扶着双拐，看着溶化的钢水，心里既激动又紧张，他想，这已是第四次炼钢试验了。
    在十天前，当他和十一个残废军人接受炼钢任务时，心里又喜又急，喜的是正合心意，急的是怕炼不出钢。他心里想，炼钢咱可是个门外汉，过去别说炼啦连见都没见过，怎能炼出钢呢？再一想，困难是死的，人是活的，只要想干，没有办不成的。于是他坐着手摇三轮车，就到外边去学习炼钢经验。在初建炉时，没有耐火砖就用青砖代替，没有缸砂和耐火土就发动群众收集，不会建炉就在地下盘土炉。经过几昼夜的苦战，到7月31日，第一个炼钢炉终于建成了，并开始了炼钢。不料，连炼了三炉，结果都遭到了失败，这时，周云龙急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，吃不下饭，睡不着觉，一个人扶着拐杖在炉口旁转来转去，仔细查看。突然发现炉壁上塌了一小块。再用棍子一捣，里边的青砖有的已经烧化。他马上发动群众，加厚炉壁，重新再炼。接着一场紧张的建炉工作又开始了，病了很久的乔克明带头垒炉，双腿残废的马兴龙和任和平赶截碎铁，郑有功院长也来参加工作。经过准备后，当晚，炼钢炉里的火焰又燃烧了起来。在一阵紧张的吹风机吹火声和炉火的吼叫声中，火红色的钢水从坩锅里流了出来，火花四溅，照红了大地。
    钢水冷却后，经过新乡市工业局化验的结果，证明这一炉钢完全达到了一等优质钢的标准。周云龙高兴地说：“炼钢并没有什么神秘，只要有决心，就能炼出钢来，我们计划到今年年底，要为祖国炼出八吨优质钢，支援国家工业建设。”
