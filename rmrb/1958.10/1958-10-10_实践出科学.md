    Practice Produces Science
    Xu Feiguang
    This year, China's 500 million farmers, through extraordinary efforts, achieved a high-speed increase in grain production, breaking grain high-yield records both ancient and modern, domestic and foreign. They overturned so-called "theories" such as the "law of diminishing returns," "agricultural products will not increase by several tens of percent annually," and "maximum limit for per-mu yield." Some outstanding farmers have been hired as researchers or teachers by scientific research institutions and universities. This is a challenge from the farmers to agricultural research institutions, agricultural schools, and agricultural scientists. The farmers have checkmated them severely. Many agronomists have been shocked by this fact. They began to change their views on farmers, admitting that farmers are more capable than themselves. They realized that if they do not catch up quickly, learn from the farmers, then their titles as scientists will also be in jeopardy. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, they are working hard to reform their thinking, get close to the masses, and face production, wanting to become scientific workers who are both red and expert. However, there are also many people who turn a blind eye to this situation, still holding their tails high. At first, they closed their eyes and shook their heads, not believing that farmers could create miracles that "scientific conclusions" did not allow. Later, a large number of miracles continued to appear, forcing them to admit that this was an objective fact, but inwardly they remained unconvinced. In the eyes of these people, only they themselves understand science, while farmers only know how to farm and do not understand science at all. They emphasize that the high yields created by farmers cannot be explained scientifically, have no basis or precedent, and are therefore not in line with science. As for "uneducated" farmers without higher education becoming scientists, they believe that this fundamentally violates the "conventional path" of scientist development. In a word, they are still the capable ones, while the farmers are not.
    To study agricultural science but look down on farmers engaged in agricultural practice, to look down on the experience gained by farmers from practice, proves that they do not understand the principle of "science reflects reality" spoken by Chairman Mao, do not understand that science is the knowledge of natural laws that people have obtained in production practice. They do not understand that only practice is the source of the occurrence and development of science. Without human practice, there would be no science at all. Once science is separated from practice, it will become a tree without roots, neither flowering nor bearing fruit, and will quickly wither and die. This means that science must listen to the voice of practice in its development, use practice to test its conclusions, discover new laws from practice, and summarize and summarize new achievements and new experiences. Only in this case can science truly serve production and promote the development of production. Most of today's scientists have skipped the stage of practice, only accepting the practical experience of predecessors and foreigners, while they themselves lack this experience. Therefore, they easily develop a misconception: that scientific conclusions can be generated out of thin air, regardless of practice. Little do they know that the very production practice that they disdain is the mother of all scientific conclusions. When production practice develops forward, the old scientific conclusions must be replaced by new scientific conclusions. This is called practice produces science, practice promotes science.
    Based on this materialistic understanding, we must admit that the unprecedented miracles created by farmers are in line with science and will inevitably lead to a revolution in agricultural science. Since farmers have done in practice what scientists at home and abroad, ancient and modern, have not done, this shows that farmers' understanding of natural laws is more profound and specific than that of many scientists, and the principles they understand are more useful in practice. Faced with this situation, the task of scientists should be to re-examine, revise, supplement, and even abandon those outdated conclusions based on new facts, and not to deny the scientific value of new facts simply because the new facts do not conform to certain old "scientific conclusions."
    Some people are superstitious about things in books and of foreigners, do not recognize the things created in our current reality, do not recognize that we can surpass foreigners and predecessors, and also show that their way of thinking is metaphysical, not understanding the dialectical view of development. According to this view, people's ability to understand nature, people's creativity and wisdom, like all other things, are infinite. Since predecessors and foreigners can draw experience from practice and develop science, then we can also summarize new experiences based on our practice, develop science, and add things that were not originally there. If it is destined that we can only do what the predecessors and foreigners have said, then science will stagnate or even die in our hands, not to mention that some foreign and previous scientific research was also separated from production practice. In the past, the peasant masses were forced by poverty to not even be able to talk about studying science; scientists and scientific research activities were only limited to a small circle, and even if there were research results, they could not be promoted. Therefore, their cognitive limitations are very large. In the current situation in our country, the change of ownership of the means of production, the liberation of people's minds, and the complete breaking of the limitations of scientific research have made the mass cultural and technological revolution movement of everyone learning science and studying science appear, which has opened up an infinitely broad road for the development of science, enabling science to develop and advance at high speed.
    According to dialectics, any scientific discovery or conclusion is only a recognition of one aspect of the laws of nature at one stage, and not a complete and final recognition. For example, in the production of grain, increased production can be obtained from improvements in any aspect of seeds, fertilizers, water, deep plowing, close planting, and field management, and greater harvests can be obtained from comprehensive improvements in all aspects. Moreover, with human practice, new aspects will be discovered, such as the application of growth stimulants, lengthening the duration of sunlight, and so on. There is no limit to agricultural production increase, and the more methods of increasing production, the better. Every new development makes people feel that the potential seems to have been exhausted, but later new possibilities for increasing production will be discovered. This development will extend forever to infinity.
    People realize this unlimited possibility, dare to think and dare to act, even if they lack scientific knowledge, as long as they explore through practice, they can still produce new production results and scientific conclusions, although this will cost a greater price and go through a more tortuous road. However, science cannot move forward even a step away from practice. Therefore, a true scientist must first respect practice and respect those who engage in production practice.
    We respect practice, but we are by no means narrow empiricists. We believe that true science can promote production practice and make human practice conscious. The current upsurge of farmers learning science and culture reflects their thirst for cultural and scientific knowledge. Our country also needs a large number of agricultural scientists to serve production. Farmers should learn scientific knowledge, and scientists should go to practice to summarize the experience of farmers, combine science with production, and serve production. Here, it must be seen that for a person who has been educated in the bourgeoisie for a long time and is divorced from production, to combine with production and clarify the purpose of serving production is a fundamental change of position. This transformation requires them to undergo a thorough revolution of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in their thinking, undergoing a complete transformation. Some of them hold a contemptuous attitude towards the initiatives of farmers, which reflects that they are not very willing to take this path, not very accustomed to it, often looking back and forth, and are nostalgic for the old state. Therefore, a little public opinion pressure should be applied to them, "checkmate" them, and pour a little cold water on their tails, so that they tuck their tails between their legs and look at the farmers with new respect. As for farmers learning science, this is another matter. This is a smooth road, but it is just returning what originally belonged to them. Because they are directly engaged in production, the purpose of learning science is very clear, and learning and application are completely consistent, so they can not only quickly master and apply science, but also dare to break through old conclusions and create new conclusions.
    Since practice can produce reason and produce science, it is natural that it can also produce scientists, which is completely in line with the law. Farmers have accumulated and summarized extremely rich experience in production practice, so they can be considered agricultural experts and are qualified to enter universities and scientific research institutions to become scientists. Some people's accusations and criticisms against them are mainly based on the argument that their knowledge lacks scientificity and systematicness. What is scientificity? In our view, knowledge that conforms to reality and objective logic is scientific. And the scientificity that some scholars talk about mainly refers to the description in books. As for how this "theory" works in practice, they don't ask. The experience of producing tens of thousands of catties of grain per mu is indeed not in books, but this experience is definitely scientific, otherwise it would not have been possible to achieve such great results. As for systematicness, no one who has been to Zhaiquan University in Henan and listened to the lectures of cotton planting experts there does not admit that his reports are not only very high in scientific level, but also very systematic, with clear levels, well-organized, detailed, and appropriate. Farmers participate in the production process from beginning to end, and they are familiar with every link of production, knowing which is the main and which is the secondary. Of course, some of the farmers' creations and experiences have not yet clarified the reasons, and some things still lack the effort of processing and polishing, but these problems can be completely solved as their cultural and scientific level gradually improves.
    According to the bourgeois saying, it is not "conventional" to produce scientists from producers, and we now want to establish such a convention. We believe that only by learning science in practice can we learn faster and better. The policy of combining labor with education put forward by the Party is precisely to change the tendency of only valuing theory and not valuing practice. It is the result of class society separating education from labor and separating labor from scientific work to spend decades specializing in education and then becoming a scientist. This should not only be regarded as a convention, but it is precisely an abnormal phenomenon that should be fundamentally eliminated. In our society, education must be closely combined with labor. As Chairman Mao said, "Factories are schools, schools are factories, and agricultural cooperatives are also schools." Everyone is both a laborer and a student; working while receiving education. It is the regular path for scientists to emerge from among them in the future.

    实践出科学
    徐非光
    今年，我国五亿农民以卓绝的努力争得了粮食的高速度增产，打破了古今中外的粮食高产纪录。他们把那些“土地报酬递减律”、“农产每年不会增加百分之几十”和“亩产量最高限度”等等“理论”统统都推翻了。一些优秀的农民被聘为科学研究机关、高等学校的研究员或教师。这是农民对农业研究机关、农业学校和农业科学家的挑战。农民狠狠地将了他们一“军”。不少农学家被这种事实所震惊。他们开始改变了对农民的看法，承认农民比自己行。他们认识到，如果自己不急起直追，向农民看齐，那末科学家头衔也势将不保了。于是，他们在党的领导下努力改造思想，接近群众，面向生产，想使自己成为又红又专的科学工作者。但是，也有不少人对这种形势熟视无睹，尾巴仍然翘得高高的。他们始则闭眼摇头，不相信农民会创造出“科学结论”所不允许的奇迹。以后大量的奇迹不断出现，迫使他们不得不承认这是客观事实，但内心仍不服输。在这些人看来，只有他们自己是懂科学的，而农民则只懂种地，根本不懂科学。他们强调说，农民创造的高产在科学上无法解释，没有根据和前例，因而也就是不符合于科学的。至于没有受过高等教育的“大老粗”农民当科学家，他们认为这是根本上违背了科学家成长的“常规”。一句话，还是他们行，而农民则不行。
    研究农业科学而看不起从事农业实践的农民，看不起农民从实践中取得的经验，这证明他们不懂得毛主席所说的“科学反映实际”的道理，不懂得科学是人们在生产实践中所获得的对自然规律的认识。不懂得只有实践才是科学发生和发展的源泉。没有了人类的实践便根本不会有科学出现。科学一旦同实践分了家，便会变成无根之木，既不开花又不结果，并且很快就会枯萎死亡。这就是说，科学在其发展中必须倾听实践的呼声，用实践来检验自己的结论，从实践中发现新的规律，概括和总结新的成果和新的经验。只有在这种情况下，科学才能真正为生产服务，推动生产的发展。现在的科学家大多数是越过实践的阶段，仅仅接受了先人的和外国人的实践经验，而自己则缺少这种经验。所以他们很容易发生一种错觉：似乎科学结论可以凭空产生，同实践无关。殊不知一切科学结论的生身之母正是他们所不屑一顾的生产实践。当生产实践向前发展了的时候，旧的科学结论就必须为新的科学结论所代替。这叫做实践出科学，实践推进科学。
    根据这种唯物的理解，我们必须承认农民创造的史无前例的奇迹是符合科学的，而且必然会引起农业科学的革命。农民在实践中既然做出了古今中外的科学家所没有做到的事，这就说明农民对自然规律的了解比许多科学家更为深刻而具体，他们所懂得的道理在实践中更为有用。面对这种情况，科学家的任务应当是根据新的事实，重新审查、修改、补充以至抛弃那些已经陈旧了的结论，而不能因为新的事实不符合某些旧的“科学结论”而不承认新事实的科学价值。
    有些人迷信书本上和外国人的东西，不承认我国当前现实中创造的东西，不承认我们可以超出外国人和前人，还表现出他们的思想方法是形而上学的，不懂得辩证的发展观。根据这种观点，人对自然界的认识能力，人的创造力和智慧，也同其他一切事物一样，是无限的。前人和外国人既然可以从实践中得出经验，发展科学，那末我们就同样可以根据我们的实践总结新的经验，发展科学，增加原来没有的东西。如果注定前人和外国人说了我们就只能照着做，那末科学在我们手里就会停滞以至死亡，何况外国的和以前的科学研究也有一些是同生产实践分离的。农民群众过去迫于生活的贫困，根本谈不到研究科学；科学家和科学研究活动只限制在一个小圈子内，即有研究成果也无法推广。因此，他们的认识局限性很大。在我国现时情况下，生产资料所有制的改变，人民思想的解放，把科学研究的局限性彻底打破了，人人学科学、研究科学的群众性文化和技术革命运动已经出现，这就为科学的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路，使科学可以高速度地发展前进。
    根据辩证法，科学上的任何发现或结论，都只能是对自然规律的一个方面在一个阶段的认识，而不是全部的最后的认识。比如粮食的生产，可以从对种子、肥料、水、深耕、密植、田间管理中的任何一方面的改进获得增产，也可以从各方面的综合改进中获得更大的丰收。并且，随着人的实践，还会发现新的方面，如施用生长刺激素，加长日光照射时间，等等。农业增产是不会有顶的，增产的方法也是愈来愈多愈好。每一次新的发展都使人们觉得潜力似乎挖尽了，但以后又会发现新的增产可能性。这种发展将永远伸延以至无穷。
    人们认识到这种无限的可能性，敢想敢作，即使缺少科学知识，但是只要通过实践摸索，还是可以产生出新的生产成果和科学的结论来的，虽然这要花较大的代价和经过更为曲折的道路。然而，科学脱离了实践却一步也无法前进。因此，一个真正的科学家必须首先尊重实践，尊重那些从事生产实践的人。
    我们尊重实践，但绝不是狭隘的经验主义。我们认为，真正的科学可以推动生产实践，使人的实践具有自觉性。我国农民现在正在掀起学科学、学文化的高潮，这正反映了他们对文化科学知识的如饥似渴的要求。我们国家也需要有大量的农业科学家来为生产服务。农民要学科学知识，科学家则应当到实践中去总结农民的经验，把科学同生产结合起来，为生产服务。这里必须看到，一个长期受资产阶级教育、脱离生产的人，要同生产结合，明确为生产服务的目的，这是一个根本立场的转变。这个转变要求他们在思想上来一个彻底的兴无灭资的革命，脱胎换骨。他们当中有些人对农民的创举持藐视的态度，这正反映了他们对走这条路还不大自愿，不大习惯，常常前顾后盼，留恋旧的状态。因此，对他们应当施加一点舆论的压力，将他们的“军”，向他们的尾巴上浇点冷水，使他们夹起尾巴来对农民“刮目而视”。至于农民学科学，这却是另外一回事。这是一条顺路，不过是把原来属于他们的东西重新归还他们。由于他们直接从事生产，学科学的目的非常明确，学用完全一致，所以他们不仅能很快掌握运用科学，而且也敢于突破旧的结论，创造新的结论。
    既然实践能出道理，出科学，自然也就能够出科学家，这是完全合乎规律的事。农民在生产实践中积累和总结了极其丰富的经验，他们便可以被认为是农业上的专家，便有资格进入大学和科学研究机构当科学家。有些人对他们的指责、非难，主要理由是说他们的知识缺乏科学性和系统性。什么叫科学性呢？在我们看来，知识符合实际，合乎客观的逻辑，就是有科学性。而有些学者所说的科学性，却主要是指书本上的叙述。至于这种“理论”拿到实践中作用如何，就不问了。亩产几万斤粮的经验，书本上的确没有，但这经验肯定是有科学性的，不然就不可能取得这么大的成果。至于系统性，去过河南翟泉大学、听过那里植棉专家的课的人没一个不承认他的报告不仅科学水平很高，而且系统性也十分强，层次分明，条理井然，详略适当。农民是从头到尾参与生产过程的，他们熟知生产的每一个环节，知道哪是主要的，哪是次要的。当然，农民的创造和经验中有一些还没有弄清道理，有些东西还缺乏加工和琢磨的功夫，但是，这些问题在他们文化科学水平逐步提高的情况下是完全可以解决的。
    根据资产阶级说法，从生产者中出科学家不是“常规”，我们现在就要建立这样的常规。我们认为，只有在实践中学习科学才可能学得更快更好。党所提出的劳动同教育相结合的方针，正是为了改变那种只重理论不重实践的倾向。专门用几十年去受教育，然后当上科学家，这是阶级社会把教育同劳动分开、把劳动同科学工作分开的结果，这不仅不应视为常规，而恰恰是应当根本消除的一种反常现象。在我们的社会中，教育必须同劳动密切结合。正如毛主席说的那样，“工厂是学校，学校是工厂，农业合作社也是学校”。人人既是劳动者，又是学生；边劳动，边受教育。从他们中间产生科学家，这才是今后的正规的道路。
