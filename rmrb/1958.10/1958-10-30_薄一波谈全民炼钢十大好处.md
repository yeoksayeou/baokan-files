Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 29th: Comrade Bo Yibo, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, praised the enthusiasm of the people of Xuzhou in vigorously developing the steel industry during his inspection of the steel and machinery industries in Xuzhou on the 21st. Based on the situation in Xuzhou, he discussed the benefits of the whole people engaging in the steel industry. He said that launching a mass movement in the steel industry has at least ten major benefits:

	First, in a very short period of time, it has cultivated a large number of cadres and workers familiar with steel smelting technology, at least ten million people nationwide. Which university could train so many talents? It doesn't exist in the world.

	Second, it has maximized the organization of labor, mobilizing all idle labor. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, men, women, old and young, urban residents, are all fighting for steel. There is no idle person in urban and rural areas, which is the greatest good thing.

	Third, the development speed of the steel industry has been greatly accelerated. With the mobilization of the whole people, steel production has doubled. This speed cannot be compared with any capitalist country.

	Fourth, taking steel as the key link drives everything. Taking steel as the key link promotes everything. Vigorously developing the steel industry promotes the development of other industries. Due to the whole people running the steel industry, the great leap forward in mining, coal, machinery, electricity, forestry, chemical industry, and transportation has been promoted.

	Fifth, only by launching a mass movement can physical labor and mental labor be combined, and the difference between the two can be gradually eliminated. Participating in smelting steel changes people's ideologies, enabling many people who have not participated in physical labor to establish or strengthen their views on production, labor, and class.

	Sixth, in common labor, people truly appear with equal attitudes, thereby further improving the relationship between leaders and the led, and further realizing "two participations and one reform" and the combination of cadres, workers, and technicians.

	Seventh, in the steel industry, resolutely implementing the principle of focusing on small-scale and indigenous methods can ignite a mass movement, which will be vigorous and lively, and not cold and deserted.

	Eighth, only on the basis of a mass movement can a great technical revolution be launched. When technology is mastered by the masses, it can improve output and quality, reduce labor intensity, and ensure high-speed progress.

	Ninth, it completely breaks the superstition in industry. Without engineers or experts, good steel and iron can still be produced.

	Tenth, the greatest benefit is cultivating people's communist ideology of "one for all, all for one." Facts refute the erroneous argument of some people that launching a mass movement in industry is "rural style" and "guerrilla habits."

	That afternoon, Comrade Bo Yibo also attended the meeting of the first secretaries of county and city Party committees held by the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the CPC, and spoke at the meeting. He encouraged the comrades present to make full use of Xuzhou's favorable conditions such as coal, ore, and convenient transportation, to take on greater responsibilities in the smelting and coal mining industries, and to build Xuzhou into a "coal and steel joint base."

    薄一波谈全民炼钢十大好处
    新华社南京29日电　中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理薄一波同志21日在徐州视察钢铁、机械工业时，盛赞徐州人民大搞钢铁工业的干劲，并根据徐州情况谈了全民大搞钢铁工业的好处。他说，在钢铁工业上大搞群众运动，至少有十大好处：
    第一，在很短时间内，培养了很多熟习钢铁冶炼技术的干部和工人，全国至少有一千万人。那一个大学能培养出这样多的人材呢？世界上是没有的。
    第二，最大限度的组织了劳动力，把一切闲散的劳动力都动员起来了。工农兵学商，男女老幼，城镇居民，都为钢铁而战。城乡无闲人，这是一件最大的好事情。
    第三，使钢铁工业发展速度大大加快了，全民动员，钢铁翻一番，这种速度是任何资本主义国家所不能比拟的。
    第四，以钢为纲带动一切，以钢为纲，推动一切，大办钢铁工业，促进了其他工业的发展。由于全民办钢铁工业，促进了采矿、煤炭、机械、电力、森林、化学工业和交通运输事业的大跃进。
    第五，只有大搞群众运动，才能使体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，逐步消灭两者之间的差别。参加冶炼钢铁，改变了人们的观念形态，使很多没有参加过体力劳动的人，树立或增强了生产观点、劳动观点和阶级观点。
    第六，在共同劳动中，人们真正以平等的姿态出现，从而进一步改善了领导与被领导的关系，进一步实现了“两参一改”和干部、工人和技术人员相结合。
    第七，在钢铁工业上，坚决贯彻以小为主以土为主的方针，就能掀起群众运动，就会轰轰烈烈，而不会冷冷清清。
    第八，也只有在群众运动的基础上，才能大闹技术革命。技术为群众所掌握，才能提高产量、质量，降低劳动强度，保证高速度前进。
    第九，彻底破除了工业上的迷信，没有工程师，没有专家，也能炼出好钢好铁。
    第十，最大的好处是培养人们的“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想。事实驳倒了某些人认为在工业上大搞群众运动是“农村作风”、“游击习气”的错误论调。
    这一天下午，薄一波同志还出席了中共徐州地委召开的县、市委第一书记会议，并在会上讲了话。他勉励到会同志要充分利用徐州有煤、有矿石和交通便利等有利条件，在冶炼、采煤工业上负起更大的责任，把徐州建成“煤钢联合基地”。
