Uproot the Spontaneous Forces of Capitalism and Build a Ladder to Communism
Xiangshan Commune in Anhui Province Was the First to Implement the "Supply System"

(Reported by this newspaper) The Xiangshan Commune in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, has cultivated a communist spirit among its members and greatly promoted production through its three-year-old "supply system" of distribution. This method has been warmly welcomed by the masses.

The Xiangshan Agricultural Cooperative was established in 1955, with an original 613 households, 2,725 people, and 4,230 mu of cultivated land. It has now been built into a people's commune with more than 6,200 households in two townships. The "supply system" distribution method used by Xiangshan Commune, although basically still based on the principle of "to each according to his work," already contains several obvious communist elements.

How is the Supply Provided?

(1) The labor income of commune members is deposited uniformly within the commune. The commune supplies the commune members with their main means of subsistence. When money is needed, it can be withdrawn with the approval of the commune, and the final settlement is made at the end.

	In terms of grain: After the autumn harvest distribution, the grain due to the commune members is not distributed to the households at once, but is uniformly stored in the commune and then distributed monthly according to the national grain ration standard. Initially, it was distributed to households. Now that canteens have been set up in all production teams, it is uniformly distributed to the canteens, and commune members eat in the canteens with meal tickets.

	In terms of daily necessities: Each household reports its actual needs to the production team, and the production team uniformly reports to the leadership for approval, and then goes to the commune's supply and marketing cooperative to collect them. These daily necessities include firewood, salt, cooking oil, towels, soap, pork, cigarettes, etc. The scope and quantity of these daily necessities have been continuously expanded and increased over the years due to the development of production. For some daily necessities that are needed in smaller quantities by some commune members, such as underwear, scarves, rubber shoes, umbrellas, brown sugar, washbasins, and thermos bottles, commune members can directly collect them from the commune's supply and marketing cooperative after the commune approves.

	During the New Year and festivals, in addition to the commune members withdrawing cash from the commune, the commune mainly distributes seasonal consumer goods. Taking this year's Spring Festival as an example, the commune distributed salt, kerosene, cigarettes, Spring Festival couplet paper, pork, as well as wine and noodles. During the Gregorian New Year, the Lantern Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, different seasonal consumer goods are distributed.

	In cases of birth, old age, illness, death, and marriage, commune members with deposits can receive physical objects or cash from the commune according to their needs. For commune members with overdrafts, the commune also lends them physical objects and cash. When commune members are sick, they can go to the clinic established within the commune for medical treatment.

	In addition, the commune has barbers for commune members to get haircuts, and the commune has a repair shop for adding or repairing furniture.

	For the above aspects, commune members do not pay cash, and all accounts are settled together after the autumn distribution.

(2) Implement the principle of "to each according to his work," more work, more pay, but guarantee the basic living needs of each commune member.

	The main principles followed in the implementation of the "supply system" of distribution are: First, according to the principle of "to each according to his work," those who work more and earn more can be supplied with more items in addition to the rationed supply. For overdraft households with less labor and more people, the commune provides supplies in terms of basic living necessities, generally not less than deposit households; and it tries to make proper arrangements in production, assigning them more suitable work to increase their income. By doing so, overdraft households have gradually decreased over the years. For some lazy people and idlers, the commune adopts the method of strengthening education and urging production, so that they can live on the remuneration they get from labor.

	The second is to implement the policy of diligence and thrift. The distribution of daily necessities is subject to the approval of the commune leadership. According to the policy of diligence and thrift, the leadership will not approve unreasonable consumption and improper needs. When implementing the above two principles, the commune leadership strengthened political and ideological work and conscientiously implemented the principle of democratic commune management.

(3) Implement free supply in some aspects.

	In addition to the food, clothing, bedding, mosquito nets, and medical care of the "five guarantees" households, which are supplied free of charge by the commune as needed, all houses belong to the commune and are distributed to commune members free of charge. Welfare undertakings such as homes for the elderly, kindergartens, and nurseries are implemented on a half-fee or free basis. Tuition fees are provided by the commune for some outstanding students. Commune members do not pay to watch plays or movies. The scope of free supply will be gradually expanded with the development of production.

	The proportion of unified supply by the Xiangshan Commune in the consumption of commune members: Calculated according to the figures distributed by the commune members, it was 90.5% in 1956, 94% in 1957, and 98.1% in 1958 (estimated); plus the income from household sideline occupations, it was 19% in 1956, 81.4% in 1957, and 83% in 1958 (estimated). That is to say, on the one hand, the physical supply part is increasing year by year, and on the other hand, commune members generally have enough pocket money.

	With the implementation of the above methods, all physical objects and cash in the commune are centrally controlled by the commune, and the needs of commune members are uniformly supplied by the commune. Regardless of the remuneration of commune members, equal supplies are guaranteed in terms of daily necessities. No interest is calculated on deposits or loans. These all have communist elements of varying degrees. The collective welfare undertakings organized by the commune are mostly of the nature of "each according to his needs."

What are the Benefits?

	First, this distribution system reduces the links of commodity supply and marketing and narrows the scope of currency circulation. The main means of subsistence of commune members are supplied by the commune, rather than purchased from the market. At the same time, the income of commune members is uniformly controlled by the commune, and its use is subject to certain review and approval, which also breaks through individual ownership and can be adjusted and used by the commune. These can further block the path of spontaneous capitalist forces and facilitate the transition to a communist society. For example, in the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, the wealthy middle peasants in the surrounding communes stirred up trouble, but here it was calm. Although this commune was not wealthy at first, it has never owed state public grain or loans since the implementation of the supply system, and there have never been incidents of grain shortages, panic buying, speculation, or usury exploitation.

	Second, this distribution system is a good way to increase the commune's working capital and thus promote production. All labor income of commune members is deposited in the commune, and the commune is very proactive in economic terms. The actual consumption of commune members each year is generally lower than the labor remuneration they should have received. The difference between the two is deposited in the commune, which increases the commune's working capital. In 1956, commune members saved more than 20,000 yuan in the commune, and in 1957, they saved more than 40,000 yuan. This has played a significant role in expanding reproduction, vigorously developing industry and sideline occupations, and vigorously developing collective undertakings. At the same time, the implementation of the "supply system" also reduces many unnecessary troubles for commune members, relatively increases labor time, and promotes the development of production. Since the establishment of the Xiangshan Commune in 1955, production has developed year by year, from a historically grain-deficient area to a surplus grain commune that sold 130,000 jin of surplus grain in 1957. In industry, there used to be nothing, but now more than 100 factories of various types have been established, and the lives of the masses have been greatly improved.

	Third, this distribution system greatly promotes the growth of commune members' communist ideas and accelerates the elimination of the remnants of private ownership of the means of production. In the past, production was collective, but life was managed by each individual. The supply system makes commune members' lives planned and collectivized, and further closely links the fate of individual commune members with the collective interests. Commune members are not worried about food and clothing, and their minds are greatly liberated. Commune members are now wholeheartedly busy with production, with an attendance rate of almost 100%, and can maintain it for a long time. Commune members generally believe that "the commune is more reliable than the family," love the commune more than love the family, and the communist idea of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" is taking root and sprouting among them. As long as it is a collective undertaking, commune members are eager to do it, for fear of falling behind. When the commune proposed to vigorously develop industry, commune members enthusiastically invested their wood at home and the money they got from cutting firewood, selling pigs, and overproduction bonuses in the commune. Because of the improvement of commune members' ideological awareness and the increase in the commune's income, this commune had long stopped relying on the remaining means of production to solve problems, so before January 1958, it turned the houses and homesteads over to the commune for public ownership, and recently it also turned over the private plots (one cent per household) to the commune for public ownership. By this time, the remnants of private ownership in the means of production had been basically eliminated, and commune members generally only had a small number of poultry and grass-cutting sickles. Moreover, this commune has not experienced any incidents of concealing production for private distribution or serious waste of public property since 1956, and there have been no lazy people because of the implementation of the "supply system," and the masses have a high level of enthusiasm for production.

The Masses' Reflections

	The implementation of the supply system by the Xiangshan Commune, on the one hand, implemented the principle of "to each according to his work," more work, more pay; on the other hand, it also contains several factors of "distribution according to need," reflecting the direction of "each according to his needs." The method of distribution by "supply system" was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants from the beginning, and later a small number of wealthy middle peasants were also satisfied. The members of the Xiangshan Commune used self-composed folk songs to praise the "supply system": "Rice, firewood, and salt are distributed, everything is complete during the New Year and festivals, there are cigarettes, meat, and sesame oil, brown sugar, firecrackers, and noodles. Straw hats are distributed when it's hot, and there is also a banana leaf fan. Towels and cigarettes are distributed, and there is also soap for washing sweat shirts. To get married, you can withdraw money, and it's even safer to have children, with maternity leave not counting, glutinous rice, brown sugar, and eggs are added. Men, women, old and young are all happy, and are happily busy with production. We help each other, our hearts are connected, and Xiangshan has become a happy mountain." An old man who had left here for more than 30 years moved back to his hometown from dozens of miles away and firmly applied to join the commune. He said: "In the past, Xiangshan forced people to leave, but now Xiangshan attracts people to come."

The Origin of the "Supply System"

	The process of implementing the "supply system" in Xiangshan Commune was not smooth sailing, but involved struggle. The essence of this struggle was the struggle between socialism and capitalism. In the spring of 1956, when the state invested in repairing the Wuwei Dam along the Yangtze River, some commune members worked on the dam and received a total labor remuneration of 11,560 yuan. At that time, the commune had just been established and had a weak foundation, and commune members still had many difficulties in their lives. Chen Guangfu, the director of the commune, a Communist Party member, and a veteran, proposed to convert the labor remuneration of the commune members working on the dam into workdays and distribute dividends together in the autumn; use this money as a fund for the implementation of the "supply system," on the one hand, to purchase some means of production, and on the other hand, for the commune to uniformly purchase grain and some daily necessities, and distribute them according to actual needs. This opinion was first opposed by Li Ping (a wealthy middle peasant), the party branch secretary who had led the commune members to work on the dam at that time. Li Ping advocated distributing all the money to individuals, arguing that it was labor income. As for the lack of funds in the commune and the difficulties in production and life, he advocated applying for loans from the state. The two opinions were debated at the party branch meeting and the commune members' meeting. In the debate, everyone unanimously criticized Li Ping's proposal, believing that Li Ping's proposal reflected the capitalist ideas of the wealthy middle peasants. The commune members pointed out that the income obtained by commune members working on the dam and participating in production in the commune should participate in the commune's collective distribution, and it is not in accordance with the commune charter to put it in their own pockets. Everyone unanimously agreed with Chen Guangfu's opinion to implement the "supply system."

	In the middle of the implementation of the supply system of distribution, some wealthy middle peasants disagreed with depositing their due share of grain and cash in the commune. Some of them wanted to develop capitalism, and some shouted "no freedom." For the wealthy middle peasants who wanted to develop capitalism, the commune launched a debate on the two roads. In the debate, some wealthy middle peasants realized the mistake of developing capitalism. For the wealthy middle peasants who shouted no freedom, the commune leadership strengthened political and ideological education on the one hand, explaining that depositing their income in the commune is beneficial to the development of production and the improvement of the lives of every commune member (including wealthy middle peasants). It was explained that they can withdraw the money at any time if they need it. On the other hand, for individual wealthy middle peasants who resolutely demanded to withdraw all labor remuneration, they were also allowed to withdraw it. In this way, the fallacy of shouting that the implementation of the "supply system" is not free was completely negated, so that the wealthy middle peasants gradually became satisfied with this distribution system.

	The method of implementing the "supply system" in Xiangshan Commune is not only greatly conducive to accelerating the victorious pace of socialist construction and rapidly increasing production, but also creates a good foundation for transitioning to a communist distribution system. Therefore, it can be said that it is a ladder to communism, a sprout of communism.

    拔掉资本主义自发势力的根　架起通向共产主义的阶梯
    安徽响山社最早实行“供给制”
    本报讯　安徽省无为县响山社三年来用“供给制”进行分配的办法，培养了社员共产主义精神，大大促进了生产。这个办法受到群众热烈欢迎。
    响山农业社于1955年建立，原有六百一十三户，二千七百二十五人，耕地四千二百三十亩。现已建成包括两个乡的六千二百多户的人民公社。响山社用“供给制”的分配办法，虽然基本上还是按照“按劳取酬”的原则，但是已经包含着若干明显的共产主义因素。
    怎样供给？
    （一）社员的劳动收入，统一存放在社内，由社供给社员主要生活资料，需用钱时经社批准可以领取，最后结算。
    粮食方面：秋收决分以后，社员应分的粮食不是一次分到户，而是统一存在社内，以后逐月按照国家粮食定量标准发放。开始时是发放到户，现在各生产队都办起食堂以后，就统一发放到食堂，社员凭饭票到食堂吃饭。
    生活必需品方面：由各户根据实际需要报告生产队，以生产队为单位统一报告领导批准后，到社内的供销部领取。这些生活必需品，包括柴、盐、食油、毛巾、肥皂、猪肉、香烟等。这些生活必需品的供应范围和数量，几年来由于生产的发展，都在不断的扩大和提高。一部分社员需要量较少的日用品，如卫生衣、围巾、胶鞋、雨伞、红糖、脸盆、热水瓶等，经社批准后，社员直接向社的供销部领取。
    过年过节时，除了社员向社支取现金外，社内主要发给节令消费品。以今年春节为例，社内发出了盐、煤油、香烟、春联纸、猪肉，还有酒和面条等物品。在阳历年、元宵节、端阳节、中秋节，都有不同节令消费品发放。
    遇到生、老、病、死和婚嫁等事，存款户的社员可以根据自己的需要，向社领取实物或现金，超支户的社员，社里也贷给实物和现金。社员生病，可到社内建立的卫生所医疗。
    此外，社员要理发，社里有理发员；要添置或修理家具，社内有修配厂。
    上述这些方面，社员不要付现金，都在秋后决分时一并结账。
    （二）实行按劳取酬，多劳多得，但是保证每个社员的基本生活需要。
    实行“供给制”分配中掌握的原则，主要有两条：一是根据按劳取酬的原则，多劳多得者，定量供应以外的物品可以多供给。对于劳力少、人口多的超支户，社内在基本生活必需品方面给予供给，一般不少于存款户；并设法在生产上给予妥善安排，分配他们多做适合的活，来增加他们的收入，这样做，几年来超支户逐渐减少。对一些懒汉、二流子，社内采取加强教育和督促生产的办法，使他们用劳动得来的报酬生活。
    二是贯彻勤俭节约的方针。生活日用品的发放，一律经社里领导批准，领导根据勤俭节约的方针，对不合理的消费和不正当的需要，就不批准。社领导在贯彻上述二个原则时，加强了政治思想工作和认真执行了民主办社的原则。
    （三）在某些方面实行无偿供给。
    除五保户的伙食、衣服、被褥、蚊帐、医药等，根据需要由社免费供给外，所有房屋全部归社，免费分给社员居住。幸福院、幼儿园、托儿所等福利事业，实行半费或免费。一部分优秀学生由社供给读书费用。社员看戏、看电影不要钱。无偿供给的范围将随着生产的发展而逐步扩大。
    响山社统一供给部分占社员消费的比例：按照社员由社分得的数字计算，1956年是90.5％，1957年是94％，1958年（预计）是98.1％；加上家庭副业收入，1956年是19％，1957年是81.4％，1958年（预计）是83％。这就是说，一方面实物供给部分逐年增加，另方面社员一般都有足够的零用钱。
    实行以上办法，社里的一切实物和现金由社集中掌握，社员的需要由社统一供给，无论社员报酬多少，在生活必需品方面均保证给以同等供给，存款或借款不计利息，这些都带有程度不同的共产主义因素，社里所举办的集体福利事业，绝大多数都是各取所需的性质。
    有哪些好处？
    第一，这个分配制度，减少了商品供销环节，缩小了货币流通范围，社员的主要生活资料都由社供给，而不是从市场上购买。同时，社员的收入统一由社掌握，使用时经过一定的审查批准，这也就突破了个人的所有权，可以由社调剂使用。这些都可以进一步堵死资本主义自发势力的道路，有利于向共产主义社会过渡。如1956年冬和1957年春，周围社富裕中农兴风作浪，而这里却风平浪静。这个社最初虽不富裕，但在实行供给制以后，从不欠国家公粮和贷款，从未发生过闹粮事件、抢购、投机倒把和放债剥削的现象。
    第二，这个分配制度是增加社的流动资金，从而促进生产的好办法。社员的劳动收入全部存在社内，社里在经济方面便非常主动。社员每年实际的消费量，一般都低于应得的劳动报酬。两者之间的差额，存在社内，就增加了社的流动资金。1956年社员节余存入社内达二万余元，1957年达四万多元。这对扩大再生产、大办工业和副业，大办集体事业等都起了很大作用。同时，实行“供给制”还减少社员许多不必要的麻烦，相对增加了劳动时间，促进了生产的发展。响山社从1955年办起农业社以后，生产逐年发展，从历史上缺粮的地区，到1957年变成出售余粮十三万斤的余粮社。工业上过去是空白，现在已办起各种类型的工厂百余个，因而群众生活也大为改善。
    第三，这个分配制度，大大促进了社员的共产主义思想的成长，加速了生产资料私有制残余的消灭。过去，生产是集体的，而生活则是各管各的。供给制使社员的生活计划化、集体化，把社员个人的命运和集体利益更进一步地紧密联系起来了。社员们吃穿不愁，思想大大解放。社员们现在一心忙生产，出勤率几乎达百分之百，而且能够持久。社员普遍认为“社比家牢靠”，爱社重于爱家，“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想正在他们中间扎根发芽。只要是集体事业社员们都争着干，唯恐落后。这个社在提出大办工业时，社员们把家里的木料和砍柴、卖猪、超产奖得来的钱都踊跃向社投资。这个社由于社员思想觉悟的提高和社里收入的增加，早就不依靠残存的那点生产资料解决问题，所以在1958年1月以前，就把房屋、宅基等归社公有，最近又把自留地（每户一厘）归社公有了。至此，生产资料方面的私有制的残余已基本消灭，社员一般只有少量的家禽和割草的镰刀。而且这个社1956年以后就没有发生过瞒产私分和严重浪费公共财物的现象，也没有因为实行了“供给制”而出现懒汉，群众的生产积极性很高。
    群众的反映
    响山社实行供给制，一方面贯彻了按劳取酬，多劳多得的原则；另方面又包含有若干“按需要分配”的因素，体现了“各取所需”的方向。用“供给制”进行分配的办法，开始就受到广大的贫农、下中农的热烈欢迎，后来一小部分富裕中农也满意了。响山社社员用自编的民歌赞颂“供给制”道：“发米发柴又发盐，过年过节样样全，有烟有肉有香油，红糖、鞭炮带挂面。到热天发草帽，另有一把芭蕉扇。发毛巾，发香烟，还有肥皂洗汗衫。要结婚，能支钱，生了孩子更安全，有产假还不算，糯米、红糖加鸡蛋。男女老少喜洋洋，高高兴兴忙生产。要互助，心相连，响山变成幸福山。”一位离开这里三十多年的老人，从数十里以外搬家回乡，坚决申请入社。他说：“过去响山逼人走，现今响山引人来”。
  实行“供给制”的来由
    响山社在实行“供给制”的过程中，并不是一帆风顺，而是有斗争的。这个斗争的实质，就是社会主义和资本主义的斗争。1956年春，那时国家投资整修长江沿岸的无为大堤，社内一部分社员在堤上做工，共得劳动报酬一万一千五百六十元。当时这个社刚办起不久，底子薄，社员生活还有不少困难。这个社的社主任、共产党员、复员军人陈广复，提议把社员在堤上做工的劳动报酬折成劳动日，在秋后一起分红；利用这笔钱作为实行“供给制”的基金，一方面购买一些生产资料，另方面由社统一购买粮食和一些生活必需品，按照实际需要进行分配。这个意见首先受到当时曾领导社员在堤上做工的党支部书记李平（富裕中农）的反对。李平主张全都分配给个人，理由是劳动所得。至于社内资金缺乏，生产和生活上有困难，他主张向国家贷款。两种意见在党支部会上和社员大会上进行了辩论。在辩论中，大家一致批判了李平的主张，认为李平的主张反映了富裕中农的资本主义思想。社员们指出，社员到堤上做工和在社内参加生产一样，所得的收入，应该参加社的集体分配，放在自己的腰包是不符合社章规定的。大家一致同意陈广复的意见实行“供给制”。
    在实行供给制分配的中间，一部分富裕中农不同意把自己应分的粮食和现金存在社内，他们中间有人想发展资本主义，有人则叫喊“不自由”。对于想发展资本主义的富裕中农，社里展开了两条道路的辩论，在辩论中，一些富裕中农认识到发展资本主义的错误。对叫喊不自由的富裕中农，社领导一方面加强政治思想教育，说明把自己收入存在社内，对发展生产、改善每个社员生活（包括富裕中农）都有好处。说明只要需要，随时可取。另方面对于个别坚决要求全部领回劳动报酬的富裕中农，也允许领回。这样，彻底否定了叫喊实行“供给制”不自由的谬论，从而使富裕中农也逐渐满意这个分配制度。
    响山社实行“供给制”的办法，不仅大大地有利于加速社会主义建设胜利的步伐，迅速提高了生产，而且是为过渡到共产主义的分配制度创造了良好基础。因此，可以说它是通往共产主义的阶梯，共产主义的幼芽。
