    A Flower on the Banks of the Wei River
    ——The Transformation of Daliushu Village, Wushan County, Gansu
  　Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    "Dirty Village" Becomes a Garden
    Many people who come to Daliushu Village in Wushan County for the first time will ask this question: Is this the countryside or the city? Because this village is so neat and beautiful! There are gardens and orchards of all sizes in the village, neat and clean streets and courtyards, clear water channels running through the village, and rows of various trees and flowers on the banks of the street canals... This beautiful scenery is like a city, but it is actually an ordinary village. And it used to be a notorious "dirty village" and "sick village" in the area. The village has a total of 193 households with a population of 827. Like many other farmers in other regions, the farmers living here did not have the habit of paying attention to hygiene in the past. At that time, garbage was everywhere in the streets and alleys, and weeds grew everywhere inside and outside the village. The several canals running through the village had never been dredged, and there were several smelly ponds on the west side of the village. Therefore, every summer and autumn, flies and mosquitoes flew around, and the whole village exuded a stench. At that time, a folk song was popular in the village: "Spring cold, summer malaria, autumn dysentery. Entering Daliuzhuang, tears welling up in my eyes, a good village, but the scabies make it so desolate." Starting in 1954, the Party members, Youth League members, and activists in this village led the villagers in launching hygiene campaigns time and time again, clearing away garbage and weeds, dredging canals filled with sludge, and filling in smelly ponds that had existed for many years. Moreover, they also used their lunch break time to repair roads, build parks and bathrooms, and plant flowers, trees, and fruit trees... They changed the appearance of environmental sanitation, beautified the village, eliminated the "seven pests" and various infectious diseases, turning this "sick village" and "dirty village" into a model hygiene village. Over the years, Daliushu Village has been like a fresh flower that never fades, attracting visitors from all over the country.
    Walking into the village is like entering a garden. There is a large garden in the center of the village, and every household has a small garden. We first visited the large garden, which used to be a large stagnant pond, filled with smelly water and sludge all year round. Every summer, weeds grew around the pond, crawling with mosquitoes and flies, emitting a nauseating stench. During the patriotic health campaign, the farmers in the village turned this smelly pond into the current garden. In the alleyways we walked through, every household whitewashed the courtyard walls, and the walls were painted with colorful murals, including spring plowing pictures, harvest pictures... Almost every household's wall revealed fruit-laden branches, enticing passers-by. We visited the home of poor peasant Chen Jingfu. As soon as we entered the courtyard, we were greeted with a sense of neatness and cleanliness. This poor peasant family of nine, although raising pigs, chickens, ducks, rabbits, pigeons, and bees, had a very clean yard. But the most attractive thing was his small garden. In addition to the paths leading to the gate, rooms, chicken coop, toilet, and pigsty, the courtyard was full of flowers and fruit trees, including grape trellises, chrysanthemums, bamboo, peonies, crabapples, and newly planted pear and apricot trees. The garden was arranged neatly, and some pebbles were laid around it.
    Only Pregnant Women Stay in the Hospital
    The most important achievement of Daliushu Village's health work is that the village has completely eliminated the "seven pests" and various infectious diseases. This should be a miracle for ordinary rural villages. We visited the village's privately run hospital. The privately run hospital and maternity hospital are together. It would be more appropriate to say that it is part of the garden, because the hospital is connected to the garden, and the number of flowers and fruit trees planted in the hospital is more than in the garden, and the area is also larger than the garden. Patients can take walks and rest among the flowers and under the fruit trees. Yu Guojun, the director of the privately run hospital, introduced us to the mass health work in Daliushu Village, saying that before the health campaign was launched, diseases were very prevalent in the village, especially before liberation, when diseases were prevalent all year round, just as the masses said, "Spring measles, summer malaria, autumn and winter colds and dysentery." For example, in the spring of 1948, a total of 130 people suffered from measles, 12 died, and 4 became blind due to the disease. In the spring of 1954, 31 people suffered from measles, and in the spring of 1955, 3 people suffered from measles. Since 1956, there has not been a single patient with measles. Other infectious diseases such as malaria, dysentery, and colds have also disappeared since 1956. Since 1956, there has not been a single patient in the village, except for an old man who fell and was injured. He also introduced us to the village's prevention of influenza in 1957. The influenza epidemic in 1957 was the most serious one. All agricultural cooperatives in Wushan County were infected, especially the villages along the Wei River. Many agricultural cooperatives around Daliushu Village stopped production, but no one in the village was infected with influenza. This is mainly because the mass health work was done well. They wore masks when working in the fields and attending meetings outside, and during the flu epidemic, the masses voluntarily did not visit relatives or go to markets and shops. Hearing this, someone in our group asked with a smile, "So, is your hospital going to close?" Director Yu also replied with a smile, "It can't be closed. Now people come to see the doctor every day, and there are still two inpatients, but these are not from Daliushu Village, they are patients from the surrounding rural areas." Finally, he smiled and said, "Now, only pregnant women stay in the hospital in Daliushu Village."

      New Customs
    The masses in Daliushu Village have become accustomed to paying attention to hygiene, and it has become an indispensable part of their daily life. Every household is like this, and everyone is like this. Every household in the village has a spittoon, every household has a trash can, everyone has a toothbrush, everyone has separate bowls and chopsticks, washbasins, and towels, and most people have two sets of clothes (one for work and one for rest). Every day at dawn, everyone in the village cleans the courtyard and streets, washes their face, brushes their teeth, and then goes to work in the fields. In the evening, after returning from work, they take a bath in the bathroom before resting. If anyone does not do this or does not do it thoroughly, they will be criticized: "You don't look like someone from Daliushu Village."
    However, it is not easy to establish this new custom. Almost everyone underwent a period of ideological struggle. The 61-year-old Chen Zhen told us about his own ideological transformation. He is a poor peasant, and in his sixty years, he had washed his face only a few times, and he never washed a new piece of clothing until his skin was exposed. His yard was full of garbage and chicken and dog feces, and he used to deal with diseases frequently. When the village launched the health campaign, he was one of the most uncooperative people. Now, Chen Zhen has become an activist in health work. He led his family in building a very beautiful small garden, planting grapes, peach trees, apricot trees, and pear trees. The whole family keeps everything very clean, with spittoons and trash cans. The kitchen utensils are covered with gauze, and all seven members of the family have their own bowls, chopsticks, washbasins, and towels. The old man said to us with a smile: He hasn't been sick for more than two years!
    Production and Health Leap Forward Together
    The village's health campaign has not only not affected production, but has also strongly supported the production movement. From the beginning of the health campaign, the village proposed to closely integrate it with production. For example, cleaning up garbage, demolishing old walls, and accumulating manure are combined, and health work can be carried out around production all year round. Taking last year as an example, they combined environmental sanitation with cleaning up more than 1.2 million catties of garbage and weeds, which were all turned into fertilizer. In the past, the village had an average of one person out of every four households who could not work due to illness. In the most serious cases, the attendance rate of the village's 600 full and semi-laborers was only 42%, while since 1956, the attendance rate has often been between 90% and 98%. They have all regained their health and rejoined the labor force. In the first half of this year alone, they have worked more than 5,700 labor days. Because health work has supported production, the village's agricultural production has increased rapidly. In 1956, the village's average yield per mu was 291 catties. Last year, the average yield per mu was 324 catties, and this year, the average yield per mu reached 2,300 catties.
    Now, Daliushu Village and several nearby agricultural cooperatives have merged to form a people's commune. The commune recently tentatively proposed a long-term vision. With the hospital as the center, its west side will be built into a welfare area, with parks, cinemas, theaters, sports fields, and libraries. Its east side will be a residential area, with houses all facing south and built into rows of flower beds and courtyards.

    渭河岸上一朵花
    ——甘肃武山县大柳树村的变迁
  　本报记者　朱波
    “脏村”变花园
    很多人初次来到武山县大柳树村的时候，都会提出这样的疑问：这是农村还是城市？因为这个村子太整洁太美丽了！村里有大大小小的花园和果园，整齐而清洁的街道和场院，横穿村中的清水渠道以及街道渠岸上成排的各种树木和花草……。这美丽的景色好像城市一样，其实这是一个普通的农村。而且是过去当地出了名的“脏村”、“病村”。这个村子共有一百九十三户，八百二十七口人。居住在这里的农民和其他很多地区的农民一样，过去没有讲卫生的习惯，那时候街头巷尾，垃圾遍地，庄里村外，野草丛生。贯穿村内的几条水渠从未疏通过，村西头还有几个臭水坑。因此，每到夏季和秋季苍蝇、蚊子横飞，全村到处都散发着一股臭味。当时村里流行着一首歌谣：“春感冒，夏疟疾，秋天到了拉痢疾。进了大柳庄，两眼泪汪汪，一个好村庄，秃疮弄的真凄凉。”从1954年开始，这个村的党、团员和积极分子带领全村群众，展开一次又一次的卫生运动，清除了垃圾和杂草，疏通了积满污泥的渠道，填平了多年的臭水坑。并且，他们还利用歇晌的时间整修了道路，修建起公园和浴室，并栽种花木和果树……。改变了环境卫生面貌，美化了村庄，消灭了七害和各种传染病，使这个“病村”、“脏村”变成了卫生模范村。几年来，大柳树村就像是开不败的一朵鲜花一样，吸引着全国各地的参观者。
    走进村子真像到了一个花园里一样，村中心有一个大花园，家家都有小花园。我们先看了大花园，这里过去是一个很大的死水坑，一年四季积满了臭水、污泥，每逢夏天，坑周围杂草丛生，爬满了蚊蝇，发出恶心的臭味。在爱国卫生运动中，全村的农民就把这个臭水坑修成了现在的花园。在我们走过的胡同，家家户户都把院墙刷成粉白色，墙上画着彩色壁画，有春耕图、丰收图……，几乎每家的墙头上，都露出果实累累的枝头，引逗着行人。我们参观了贫农陈敬福的家庭，一走进院子就给人以整齐清洁的感觉。这个九口人的贫农之家，虽然养着猪、鸡、鸭、兔、鸽子和蜜蜂，院子里却非常干净。但是最吸引人的还是他的小花园。院子里除了通往大门、房间、鸡窝、厕所和猪圈的小路外，满院都种上了鲜花和果树，其中有葡萄架、菊花、竹子、牡丹、海棠和新栽的梨树和杏树等，花园布置的很整齐，周围还铺了一些河卵石。
    只有孕妇才住医院
    大柳树村卫生工作最主要的成绩，还是该村彻底消灭了七害和消灭了各种传染疾病。这对普通农村来说应该是一个奇迹。我们访问了这个村的民办医院。民办医院和产院在一起，如果说是医院，还不如说是花园的一部分恰当些，因为医院紧连着花园，医院里种的鲜花和果树的样数比花园还多，而且，面积比花园也大。病人可以在花丛中、果树下散步休息。民办医院院长于国俊向我们介绍大柳树村的群众卫生工作的情况说，开展卫生运动之前，该村疾病流行的很严重，尤其是解放前，一年四季都有疾病流行，正如群众所说的“春患麻疹夏疟疾，秋冬感冒拉痢疾。”例如1948年的春天，患麻疹的共一百三十人，死亡十二人，因病双目失明的四人，1954年春患麻疹的三十一人，1955年春三人。1956年以后没有一个患麻疹的病人，其它如疟疾、痢疾、感冒等十几种传染病，从1956年起也都绝迹了。从1956年起，全村没有一个病人，只有一个跌伤的老人。他还向我们介绍了1957年该村预防流行性感冒的情况。1957年流行性感冒是最严重的一次，武山县各个农业社都传染上了，尤其是沿渭河两岸的村庄更严重，大柳树村周围有很多农业社都停止了生产，但是，该村没有一个人被传染上流行性感冒。这主要原因是群众卫生工作搞的好。上地劳动，出外开会都带着口罩，而且在传染感冒期间，群众都自动不串亲戚，不赶集上店。听到这里，我们当中有人笑着问道：“这么说，你们医院不是要关门了吗？”于院长也笑着回答说：“关不了门，现在每天都有人看病，并且还有两个住院的病人，但是，这不是大柳树村的，都是周围农村的病人。”最后，他笑笑又说：“现在，大柳树村只有孕妇才住院呢。”
      新风尚
    大柳树村的群众讲卫生已经成为习惯了，成为日常生活中不可缺少的东西。家家如此，人人如此。全村家家有痰盂，家家有垃圾箱，人人有牙刷，人人都分碗筷、分脸盆和手巾，多数的人都有两套衣服（劳动时一套，休息时一套），每天天刚亮，全村的人就打扫院子、街道，洗脸、刷牙，然后才下地劳动，傍晚劳动归来，到浴室里洗个澡才休息，如果有谁没有这样做或做的不彻底，就会受到批评：“你不像是大柳树村的人”。
    但是，这种新的风尚的树立很不容易。几乎每个人都进行了一番思想斗争。六十一岁的老陈榛告诉我们他本人思想转变的过程。他是个贫农，六十多年来他洗过有数的几次脸，一件新衣服到露出肉也不洗一次。在他住的院子里到处都是垃圾和鸡、狗的粪便，他过去经常和病魔打交道。当全村开展卫生运动的时候，他是思想最不通的一个。现在，老陈榛已经成为卫生工作的积极分子。他领着全家人修了一个非常美丽的小花园，种了葡萄、桃树、杏树和梨树。全家收拾得非常清洁，有痰盂，有垃圾箱，厨房的食具都用纱布罩着，并且全家七口人都有自己的碗筷、洗脸盆和手巾，老汉乐哈哈地对我们说：他两年多没生过病啦！
    生产，卫生齐跃进
    这个村的卫生运动不仅没有影响生产，而且有力地支援了生产运动。该村从搞卫生运动开始，就提出要紧密结合生产。例如，清除垃圾，拆旧墙和积肥相结合，并且使卫生工作一年四季都能围绕着生产进行。就以去年为例，他们结合搞环境卫生，清除垃圾、杂草一百二十多万斤，全部变成了肥料。该村过去平均每四户经常有一个人因病不能劳动，最严重的时候，全村出勤率经常只占六百多个全、半劳力的42％，而从1956年以来出勤率经常在90％—98％。他们也都恢复了健康，重新参加了劳动。仅今年前半年，他们就工作了五千七百多个劳动日。由于卫生工作支援了生产，该村农业生产提高的很快。1956年，该村平均每亩产量二百九十一斤，去年平均亩产三百二十四斤，今年平均亩产达到二千三百斤。
    现在大柳树村已经和附近的几个农业社合并建成一个人民公社，这个公社最近初步提出了一个远景图案，以医院为中心，它的西面则建成福利区，有公园，有影剧院，有运动场，有图书馆，它的东面为居民住宅区，房屋一律坐北向南，并都修成一排排的花坛庭院。
