The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has presented many new problems for plant protection work, some of which were previously considered difficult to solve, but this year they have been successfully resolved one by one. The large-scale control of wheat rust is one example.

In the first half of this year, the Anhui and Jiangsu Provincial Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, with great determination and boldness, mobilized the broad masses of the province to use agents to control wheat stem rust on tens of millions of mu of wheat fields, achieving great success. This broke the superstition that agents could not be used to control the threat of wheat rust on a large scale.

It is particularly worth mentioning that in the process of prevention and control, the broad masses of farmers in Anhui Province displayed a spirit of daring to think and act, boldly creating and using various indigenous pesticides for prevention and control. The area controlled with indigenous pesticides accounted for 38.7% of the province's total control area, solving the problem of insufficient supply of lime and sulfur. This is a remarkable achievement. However, many plant pathology experts have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of indigenous pesticides. Recently, our Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Department of Biology of Peking University cooperated to conduct greenhouse inoculation identification of many kinds of indigenous pesticides, confirming that there are indeed quite a few kinds that have a preventive effect on wheat rust, including the well-known "cat's eye" (Euphorbia helioscopia) and red shank (Persicaria maculosa). It can be affirmed that there are extremely rich scientific treasures in these that can serve current production. This proves that the central government's policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods is completely correct.

    药剂防治大面积小麦锈病的创举
    证明土农药中有极为丰富的科学宝藏
    汪可宁
    农业生产的大跃进给植物保护工作提出了许多新问题，其中有一些在过去一直是认为难于解决的，但是今年都一一迎刃而解。小麦锈病大面积的防治就是一例。
    今年上半年，中共安徽、江苏两省省委都以极大的决心和魄力，动员了全省的广大群众，在数千万亩的麦田上用药剂来防治小麦秆锈病，取得了很大的成绩。破除了大面积上不能用药剂防治小麦锈病威胁的迷信。
    特别值得一提的是在防治过程中，安徽省广大农民群众发挥了敢想敢做的精神，大胆地创用了各种土农药进行防治。用土农药防治面积，占全省总防治面积的38.7％，解决了石灰和硫黄供应不足的问题，这是一件很了不起的事情，但是，有不少的植病专家却曾经对土农药的效果表示怀疑。最近我们农业科学院植物保护研究所和北京大学生物系合作，对很多种土农药进行了温室接种鉴定，证实其中对小麦锈病有预防作用的种类确属不少，包括大家所熟知的猫儿眼、红蓼等在内，可以肯定这里面有着能为当前生产服务的极为丰富的科学宝藏。证明了中央所提出的土洋结合的方针是完全正确的。
