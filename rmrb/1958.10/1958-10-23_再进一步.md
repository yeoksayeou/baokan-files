	One Step Further
	Zhang Jing
	The autumn iron and steel front is just like the peonies in spring, with thousand-ton counties and ten-thousand-ton counties blooming more vibrantly than the last. Looking at this beautiful picture, who wouldn't feel proud of this inspiring victory?
	However, we must never be intoxicated by the scenery before us. Although the production of pig iron is increasing every day, there are still many problems in some areas regarding product quality and the organization and allocation of labor.
	What attitude should we take towards the new problems currently facing indigenous iron smelting? There are two attitudes here: one is to maintain the status quo. They say, "Indigenous methods are inevitably wasteful of labor and reduce quality." This kind of thinking is, in essence, a distortion of the "small, indigenous, mass" policy. The "small, indigenous, mass" policy put forward by the Party is a positive one. Its purpose is to develop our iron and steel industry more, faster, better, and more economically. If we achieved the requirements of "more" and "faster" yesterday, then today we must strive further towards the directions of "better" and "more economically." Anyone who wants to maintain the status quo will not only fail to solve new contradictions, but will also find it difficult to consolidate existing achievements. This is a very obvious truth.
	The other is the attitude of continuous revolution, which is neither satisfied with existing achievements nor avoids new contradictions. We must always adhere to the "small, indigenous, mass" policy and constantly enrich and develop its content in practice. The Puzhen Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Nanjing, after its iron production normalized, continued to mobilize the masses to carry out a large-scale technical revolution, achieving mechanized and automated operation, modular furnace building, gas ventilation, and mass technical participation. This is the best example of correctly treating "small, indigenous, mass" methods.
	Currently, about 20 million people across the country are engaged in manual crushing of raw materials and fuel for steel production. If various localities make a concentrated effort to manufacture a batch of crushing machinery to replace manual labor, then not only can a group of laborers be freed up to go to the places where industrial and agricultural production is most needed, but it will also be of great significance in preparing for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture next year. The experience of Puzhen gives us an important enlightenment: to make indigenous iron smelting bloom more beautifully, we must resolutely carry out tool reform.

    再进一步

    秋天的钢铁战线，恰像春天的牡丹一样，千吨县、万吨县，一朵比一朵开得更鲜艳。看看这幅美丽的图画，谁能不为这个振奋人心的胜利而感到自豪。
    但是，我们绝不迷恋于眼前的景色。目前，生铁的产量虽然是天天提高了，有些地方的产品质量以及劳动力的组织和调配上还存在着不少问题。
    究竟应该采取什么态度对待目前土法炼铁中面临着的新的问题呢？这里有两种态度：一种是维持现状。他们说：“小土群嘛，就是免不了要浪费劳力、减低质量的。这种思想，实质上是对小、土、群方针的曲解。党所提出的小、土、群方针是积极的。它的目的是为了更多、更快、更好、更省地发展我们的钢铁工业。如果说，昨天我们达到了多与快的要求，那末今天就要进一步向好与省的方向去努力。谁要想维持现状，不但是新的矛盾不能解决，连已有的成绩也很难巩固。这是很明显的道理。
    另一种是不断革命的态度，既不满足于已有的成绩，也不回避新的矛盾。始终坚持小、土、群的方针，并且在实践中不断地去充实和发展它的内容。南京浦镇车辆修理工厂在出铁正常之后，继续发动群众来了一个大规模的技术革命，做到了操作机械化自动化，砌炉模具化，通风瓦斯化，技术群众化，这是正确对待小土群的一个最好的例子。
    目前，全国大约有两千万人担负着钢铁生产的原料燃料的手工破碎劳动，如果各地突击制造一批破碎机械，代替手工操作，那末，不仅可以抽出一批劳动力到工农业生产最需要的地方去，而且对准备明年工农业大跃进更有重大意义。浦镇的经验，使我们得到一个重要启示，要使土法炼铁开放出更美的花朵，必须坚决进行工具改革。
