　　Zhang Shifu had just reached the door after getting off work when he was called into the office by Old Li, the Party Branch Secretary of the workshop. After sitting down, Old Li began, "Zhang Shifu, in order to support the construction of our Wuhan Iron and Steel Works, our factory has decided to send Xiao Liu with some people. We are seeking your opinion." At first, Zhang Shifu listened with his hands supporting his chin, but suddenly he lowered his hands and looked at Old Li in surprise. He couldn't believe his ears and asked suspiciously, "Xiao Liu!?" Zhang Shifu then asked, "Can't someone else go?" Old Li smiled and said, "Xiao Liu has high skills and ability. Are you reluctant to part with him?" Zhang Shifu said, "That's not necessarily the case. Our production is also important." Old Li walked up to Zhang Shifu, patted him on the shoulder affectionately, and said, "Zhang Shifu, production is also important in other places. The whole country is in the Great Leap Forward. We must send the most advanced people there to ensure Wuhan Iron and Steel is completed as soon as possible." Zhang Shifu lowered his head and said nothing.

　　Zhang Shifu walked out of the office, his head buzzing. The weather was very hot, and Zhang Shifu felt even more upset. When he got home, he washed his face and lay down on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. He counted on his fingers: Five years! He had taught more than forty apprentices, and one by one they had been transferred away. Now he only had Xiao Liu by his side, and now he was also being transferred. Didn't this mean they didn't value our production? He remembered arguing with the workshop director the year before to keep Xiao Liu. The workshop director called him "selfish and disregarding the overall situation." He still couldn't figure out the meaning of these words.

　　After a clap of thunder, it started to rain heavily. Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and Xiao Liu, wearing a raincoat, ran into the house, soaked to the skin. It turned out that Xiao Liu had already known that he was going to Wuhan Iron and Steel Works and was so happy that he jumped up and down. Old Li told Xiao Liu to persuade Zhang Shifu. As soon as Xiao Liu stepped into the door, he grinned non-stop and walked up to Zhang Shifu, saying, "Shifu, I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. Are you reluctant to let me go?" Zhang Shifu smiled wryly and said, "I am." As he said this, he felt a pang in his heart and his eyes blurred. He forced himself to calm down and said, "Go!" Xiao Liu saw that Zhang Shifu had agreed and happily said, "I'll go pack my things."

　　After Xiao Liu left, Zhang Shifu sat on the bed and sank into thought again. He thought: Young people regard going to places thousands of miles away from home for construction as their glory. Can I stop them from going? Keeping skilled people in our own factory and letting other factories fall behind, isn't that selfishness? It's all for socialism, what's there to be reluctant about? I'm not that old yet, and I can train some more people in the future. He decided to go to Old Li.

　　The sky cleared after the rain, and the air was very fresh. Zhang Shifu took a deep breath. Countless giant blast furnaces stood on the ground, half the sky was red, iron was being tapped, and the light of electric welding flashed on and off. Zhang Shifu felt unspeakably happy. He walked quickly, and soon reached the door of the office. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, Old Li greeted him. Zhang Shifu opened his mouth and said, "Old Li, I've figured it out, let Xiao Liu go!" Old Li smiled and said, "Are you willing?" Zhang Shifu said decisively, "What's there to be unwilling about!"

　　Zhang Shifu went to Xiao Liu's dormitory and silently helped him pack his things. Before leaving, Zhang Shifu said to Xiao Liu, "I have nothing to say to you. I only hope that you will work hard after you get there, don't miss me, and write to me."

　　More than half a month later, Old Li led twenty or so young people to Zhang Shifu and said, "They are here to ask you to be their Shifu." Zhang Shifu's heart blossomed with joy. Looking at these young people, all with rosy faces and sturdy builds, he said excitedly, "Old Li! You really haven't disappointed me!"

    张师傅送走了徒弟
    安徽马鞍山铁厂　濮德富
    下班了。张师傅刚走到门口，就被车间党支部书记老李喊到办公室里。坐好以后，老李开口说：“张师傅，为了支援咱们的武钢建设，我们厂里决定派小刘带一些人去，我们征求您意见。”起先张师傅两手托着下颚地听着，突然他放下了手，惊奇地望着老李。他不相信自己的耳朵，怀疑地问：“小刘！？”张师傅紧接着问：“能不能换别人去？”老李笑着说：“小刘技术高，有能力。您舍不得他？”张师傅说：“那倒不一定。我们的生产也要紧。”老李走到张师傅的面前，拍着他的肩膀亲热地说：“张师傅，别的地方生产也要紧，全国都在大跃进，我们要把最先进的人派到那里去，让武钢早日建成。”张师傅低着头不说话了。
    张师傅走出办公室，头脑嗡嗡地响着，天气闷热得很，张师傅心里更加烦闷。回到家，洗了一下脸，他就倒在床上，望着天花板出神。他扳着指头计算：五年了！教出的徒弟有四十多人，一个一个都调走了，身边现在只有一个小刘，现在也要调走，这不是不重视我们的生产吗？他想起前一年为了留下小刘和车间主任顶嘴的事，车间主任说他“自私，不顾大局”，他现在还琢磨不透这句话的道理。
    一阵雷响后，哗哗地下起大雨来。突然，门一推，小刘披着件雨衣，水淋淋地跑进屋来。原来小刘早已知道自己要到武钢去，高兴得蹦跳起来，老李告诉小刘要他说服一下张师傅。小刘一跨进门，就咧着嘴笑个不停，走到张师傅面前说：“师傅，我后天要走了，您舍得我离开吗？”，张师傅苦笑了一下说：“舍得。”说着，不觉心里一酸，只觉得眼睛模糊，他勉强镇静地说：“你去吧！”小刘看到了张师傅说愿意了，就高兴地说：“我整理东西去。”
    小刘走后，张师傅坐在床上，又沉入了思索中，他想：青年人都把到离家千里远的地方去建设当作自己的光荣，我能阻挡他们去吗？把技术高的人留在自己厂里，让别的厂落后，这不是自私是什么呢？同是为了社会主义，有什么舍不得呢？自己年龄还不算怎么大，今后再培养出一些人来。他决定找老李去。
    雨后天晴，空气非常新鲜，张师傅深深地吸了一口气。无数个巨人般的高炉矗立在地面上，半个天边通红，正在出铁，电焊的光一闪一闪。张师傅心里有说不出来的快活。他急急地走着，不一会到了办公室门口，刚跨进门槛，老李就迎上来。张师傅开口就说：“老李，我想通了，让小刘去！”老李笑着说：“您舍得吗？”张师傅斩钉截铁地说：“有什么舍不得的！”
    张师傅到了小刘宿舍里，默默地帮他理东西。临走，张师傅对小刘说：“我也没有什么话对你说，我只希望你到那里后要努力工作，不要挂念我，要写信给我。”
    过了半个多月，老李引着二十几个青年人到张师傅面前说：“他们来拜您做师傅。”张师傅心里乐开了花，望着这些青年人个个都是红光满面，体格魁梧，他激动地说：“老李！您真没有使我失望！”
