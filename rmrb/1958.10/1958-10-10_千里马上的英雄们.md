    Heroes on the Chollima Horse
    By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang
    Chollima has become the symbol of the era for the Korean people today. In the factories and villages of North Korea, and in the ranks of mass parades, one can see everywhere a winged steed: a picture of a horse rearing up on its hind legs and galloping forward. Responding to Premier Kim Il-sung's call to "ride the Chollima and advance towards socialism," the broad masses of working people are pushing socialist construction to its climax with soaring enthusiasm and unprecedented speed. Korean workers are set to produce more steel, coal, electricity, and chemical fertilizers this year than in any year in history. Farmers will produce nearly 3.7 million tons of grain this year, close to the 1961 target. Look! The millions upon millions of Koreans who have mounted the Chollima are displaying their talents and wisdom for socialism, and countless dazzling heroes are constantly emerging.
    
    The Person Who Stepped into 1962
    Ju Bing-shan, a weaver at the Pyongyang Textile Factory, is the person who, holding high the red flag, first stepped into 1962. In April of this year, she completed the task of weaving 350,000 meters of cloth within the first Five-Year Plan, three years and eight months ahead of schedule, in one year and four months.
    
    I saw this 27-year-old female worker in the weaving factory. Dressed in a snow-white work uniform, she darted like a swallow among the thirty looms. She weaves both high-quality and large quantities of cloth, with a first-class product rate reaching over 99%. She is the first person in the Republic to reach this level of technical proficiency. However, she has recently increased the number of looms she oversees to thirty-five and is striving to reach forty. She said that from now until 1961, the year the Five-Year Plan is completed, she will produce one million meters of cloth more than the Five-Year Plan stipulates. This is two hundred thousand meters more than the total amount of cloth she has woven in the ten years she has been a weaver.
    
    Ju Bing-shan is the daughter of a tenant farmer. Her parents died of poverty and illness when she was fourteen. Ten years ago, in the spring of the year the Republic was founded, this seventeen-year-old orphan entered the textile factory as a weaver. Today, she is a labor hero and a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. She has never attended school, but she has learned the equivalent of junior high school education at the factory's adult school. She said, "I grew up under the care of the Republic, I am a daughter of the Republic."
    
    Ju Bing-shan is a banner of the Pyongyang Textile Factory. She has taken the lead in stepping into 1962, and her companions Park Jin-yu and Kim Bong-ye are catching up from behind.
    
    Doctor Iron Coke
    People have given the metallurgical engineer Zhu Zhongming a nickname called "Doctor Iron Coke." This 35-year-old young engineer, who has never studied abroad, fully deserves the title of Doctor. Through seven years of arduous research and experimentation with his companions, he produced iron coke and formally used iron coke to make iron for the first time in the world, which greatly increased the iron output of the blast furnace and saved a lot of coke. This pioneering work greatly revolutionized iron-making technology and contributed to the development of world metallurgical technology.
    
    I met this young engineer in the office of the director of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works. He was wearing an ordinary gray cadre uniform, but his simple, dark face and strong arms made him look more like a worker than an engineer. Before the war, he studied in the Department of Metallurgy at Kim Chaek University of Technology. During the war, he joined the People's Army. After being demobilized in 1952, he began the research work of iron coke according to the situation that North Korea lacked coking coal. His material was only a brief introduction about iron coke in a Soviet magazine. Iron coke is simple to say (just mixing a certain proportion of iron ore powder into the coal for coking), but it involves a series of specific and complex theoretical and technical problems, which have not yet been solved in the world.
    
    However, Zhu Zhongming, who dared to think and act, under the support of the Korean Workers' Party, tenaciously delved into it. He and his comrades picked up broken refractory bricks on the beach, built small coking furnaces and iron-making furnaces, and carried out experimental research. They conducted one hundred times after ten failures, and one thousand times after one hundred failures. In the past seven years, they have conducted more than four thousand experiments with twelve kinds of coal and six kinds of ore, and finally succeeded. Their long-term practice has proved that iron coke can produce 35% more iron than ordinary coke and save 27% of coking coal.
    
    Now, the painstaking efforts of Zhu Zhongming and his comrades have blossomed and bear fruit. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works has been using iron coke to make iron for more than a month. The output of pig iron has increased from the average daily output of more than 460 tons in late June to more than 630 tons in mid-August. Recently, it has increased by more than 100 tons. The daily output of this blast furnace has reached more than twice the level during the Japanese rule.
    
    Sixty-Two Year Old Hero
    According to the labor laws of Korea, workers who are sixty years old should retire. However, Yuan Daozhong, an old riveter at the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works, was awarded the title of Labor Hero this year at the age of sixty-two. The reporter met this respectable old man in the office next to the blast furnace construction site of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works. He is an old worker in this factory for more than 40 years, wearing a white work clothes, his bald head and missing teeth explain his age. It is truly incredible that during the most intense period of the blast furnace restoration project last winter and this spring, he and the young workers climbed to the top of the blast furnace more than 30 meters high and stormed the assembly of the furnace top in the face of the biting cold wind. Moreover, after working all day, the young men tried hard to persuade him to go home, but after a while, his old and thin body appeared on the brightly lit building frame again.
    
    What is most touching is the invention and creation of the old man. Restoring the blast furnace required processing very large two-and-a-half centimeter thick iron plates into cylinders. At present, the most mechanical factories in northern Korea can only process two-centimeter thick iron plates. If these iron plates were sent abroad for processing, the construction period would be delayed. This became a key issue as to whether the blast furnace could be built before the "May Day" holiday. Yuan Daozhong thought about this problem day and night, and he was inspired by the pile driving hammer. He created a 400 kilogram hammer, plus 40 years of experience as a riveter, and processed 20 feet of iron plate according to specifications in less than a month and a half. Yuan Daozhong told reporters that now the factory is our own workers', and the blast furnace is restored by our Korean people with their own hands. Thinking of these, I feel proud, and the hard work is not hard.

    千里马上的英雄们
    本报记者　王玉章
    千里马已成为朝鲜人民今天的时代的象征。在朝鲜北部的工厂农村和群众游行的行列里，到处都可以看到一匹长着翅膀的骏马：高扬起前蹄向前飞奔的图画。广大劳动人民响应金日成首相提出的“跨上千里马向社会主义前进”的号召，以冲天的干劲和空前的速度把社会主义建设推向最高潮。朝鲜的工人今年要生产比历史上任何一年都要多的钢铁、煤炭、电力、化学肥料。农民们今年生产的粮食几乎可达三百七十万吨，接近1961年的指标。看吧！跨上了千里马的千千万万的朝鲜人，都为社会主义施展出了他们的才能和智慧，无数光采夺目的英雄正在不断地涌现出来。
    跨进1962年的人
    平壤纺织工厂织布工朱炳善是高举着红旗首先跨进1962年的人。她在今年4月就以一年零四个月的时间，提前三年八个月，完成了第一个五年计划内织布三十五万公尺的任务。
    我曾在织布厂里看到这位二十七岁的女工。她穿着雪白工作服，像一只燕子一样轻捷地穿行在三十台织布机中间，她织的布又多又好，一等品达到99％以上。在共和国达到这样的技术水平她是第一个。可是，最近她看的织布机数已增加到三十五台，并且正在争取达到四十台。她说，从现在到1961年五年计划完成的那一年，她要比五年计划规定的任务多生产一百万公尺布，这比她当织布工十年以来织的布的总数还多二十万公尺。
    朱炳善是一个佃农的女儿，十四岁上她的父母就在贫病交加的折磨下死去。十年前，也就是共和国成立的那一年春天，这个十七岁的孤儿进了纺织厂当织布工。今天她是劳动英雄、最高人民会议议员。她没有上过学，可是她在工厂里的成人学校中学到了等于初中的文化程度。她说，我是在共和国的抚育下成长起来的，我是共和国的女儿。
    朱炳善是平壤纺织工厂的一面旗帜，她领先跨进了1962年，她的同伴朴金玉、金凤礼正在随后赶上来。
    铁焦博士
    人们给冶金工程师朱锺鸣取了一个绰号叫做“铁焦博士”。这位并没有出洋留过学的三十五岁的青年工程师，对博士的称号是完全当之无愧的。他同他的同伴通过七年如一日的艰苦的研究试验，制成了铁焦，并在世界上第一次用铁焦正式炼铁，使高炉的出铁量大大增加，节约了许多焦炭。这个创举大大地革新了炼铁技术，为世界冶金技术的发展作出了贡献。
    在黄海制铁所的厂长办公室里，我会见了这位年轻的工程师。他穿着一套普通的灰色干部服，但他那质朴黝黑的面孔和粗强的手臂，都使人感觉到他不像一个工程师而更像一个工人。他在战争以前在金策工业大学冶金系上学，战时他参加了人民军。1952年复员后，他根据朝鲜缺少炼焦煤的情况，开始了铁焦的研究工作，他的材料只有一本苏联杂志上一篇概要的介绍铁焦的文章。铁焦说起来虽很简单（只是把一定比例的铁矿石粉末掺入煤中去炼焦），但是做起来却有一系列的具体的复杂的理论和技术的问题，在世界上还没有解决。
    但是，敢想敢做的朱锺鸣，在朝鲜劳动党的支持下，顽强地钻研，他和他的同志们到海滩上拣来破碎了的耐火砖，修起小型的炼焦炉和炼铁炉，进行试验研究。十次失败了进行一百次，一百次失败了进行一千次，七年来他们分别用十二种煤和六种矿石共进行了四千多次试验，终于得到了成功。他们长期的实践证明，用铁焦可比普通焦增产生铁35％，而且节约焦煤27％。
    现在，朱锺鸣和他的同志们的心血已开花结果了。黄海制铁所的第一号高炉用铁焦炼铁已经一个多月了。生铁的产量已由6月下旬的平均日产量四百六十多吨增加到8月中旬六百三十多吨。最近又增加了一百多吨。这座高炉的日产量已经达到了日本统治时期的两倍以上。
    六十二岁的老英雄
    根据朝鲜的劳动法令，六十岁的工人就该退休了。可是，黄海制铁所的老铆工元道仲却在今年六十二岁的时候，获得了劳动英雄的称号。记者在黄海制铁所高炉建筑工地旁边的办公室里，见到了这位可敬的老人。他是这个厂四十多年的老工人了，穿着一身白色的工作服，秃了的头顶和脱落了的牙齿说明着他的年纪。说起来真令人难以置信，在去冬今春高炉恢复工程最紧张的时候，他同青年工人们一道竟爬上三十多公尺高的高炉顶，迎着刺骨的寒风突击装配炉顶。而且当干了一天活以后，小伙子们好容易把他劝回家去，可是过不了一会儿，他那苍老而瘦劲的身躯又出现在电灯辉煌的建筑架上了。
    最使人感动的是老人搞的发明创造。恢复高炉需要把很大的厚二点五公分的铁板加工成圆筒。目前朝鲜北部各机械厂最多只能加工两公分厚的铁板。如果把这些铁板送到国外去加工就误了工期。这成了一个能否在“五一”节前建成高炉的关键问题。元道仲昼夜地想这个问题，他从打桩用的吊锤得到了启发。他创造了一个四百公斤的吊锤，再加上四十年铆工的经验，不到一个半月就把二十丈铁板按照规格加工好了。元道仲对记者说，现在工厂是我们工人自己的，高炉是我们朝鲜人民用自己的手恢复起来的，想到这些，我就感到自豪，吃力的活也不吃力了。
