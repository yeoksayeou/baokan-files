Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 4th. The Wuhan Railway Hub Project was completed ahead of schedule and handed over to the state for use on October 1st. The project includes the construction and expansion of twelve passenger and freight stations, and the construction of five new large and medium-sized bridges, including more than 80 kilometers of new station lines and bypasses around the Hankou urban area. Its completion has met the busy transportation needs of the north-south railway after the opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
　　
The Wuhan Railway Hub Project started construction in May 1957 and was originally scheduled to be completed in June 1959. The entire project was technically very complex and faced many construction difficulties, but the vast number of officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army, who were responsible for the construction of this project, displayed soaring enthusiasm and determination in the construction, which finally led to the completion date being brought forward again and again.

    适应南北铁路运输需要
    武汉铁路枢纽工程建成
    新华社武汉4日电　武汉铁路枢纽工程提前建成，已在10月1日交付国家使用。这一工程共新建和扩建了十二个客货运站，新建大、中桥梁五座，其中新建站线和绕汉口市区的迂回线长达八十多公里。它的建成使武汉长江大桥通车后南北铁路繁忙的运输需要得到满足。
    武汉铁路枢纽工程是1957年5月动工兴建的，原计划1959年6月建成。整个工程技术十分复杂，施工困难很多，但是担任这一工程建设的人民解放军铁道兵某部的广大官兵，在施工中发挥了冲天干劲和钻劲，终于使竣工期限一再提前。
