The Industrial Research Institute of the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry has vigorously implemented the policy of "exploring the potential of domestic resources" for the past six months, achieving remarkable results. The Institute has successfully trial-produced a batch of new raw materials and products using local raw materials, including wood glue, rayon, wild banana paper, and moisture-proof paper.

    After referring to the glue-making formula of a glue factory in Tianjin, China, the Institute used raw materials such as cattle blood and pig blood to make wood glue. The quality of this wood glue is no worse than that of foreign goods and can adapt to the Vietnamese climate.

    Rayon is made from some kinds of trees and reeds in the mountains. After testing, the rayon made from these woods may replace some cotton yarn in weaving fabrics.

    Wild banana paper is made from wild bananas. The paper is white in color and has good toughness. Its quality is better than the paper currently produced in Vietnam. Wild bananas are ubiquitous in Vietnam.

    The Institute has also successfully researched using "Golden Plum" oil to replace part of coconut oil in making soap. This soap is of good quality, not only does it have a lot of foam, but it is also durable. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    利用土原料制成新产品
    越南工业部工业研究院半年来大力贯彻“发掘国内资源潜力”的方针，获得了显著的成绩。研究院用土产原料试制成功一批新原料和产品，其中有粘木胶、人造纤维、野蕉纸、防湿纸等。
    研究院参考了中国天津一个制胶厂的制胶配方后，用牛血和猪血等做原料，制成粘木胶。这种粘木胶的质量不比外国货差，而且能够适应越南的气候。
    人造纤维是用山区的一些种类的树木和茅草制成的。在经过试验后，用这些木材制成的人造纤维可能代替一部分棉纱织成布料。
    野蕉纸是用野蕉制成的。纸色泽洁白，并且富有韧性，质量比越南目前出产的纸还好。野蕉在越南到处皆是。
    研究院还研究成功用“金丝李”油代替一部分椰油，制成肥皂。这种肥皂质量良好，不仅泡沫多，而且耐用。（据新华社讯）
