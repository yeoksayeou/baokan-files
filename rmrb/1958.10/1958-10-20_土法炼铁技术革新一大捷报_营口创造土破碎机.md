    A Great Victory in Technical Innovation of Indigenous Iron Smelting
    Yingkou Creates Indigenous Crusher
    This ore crusher can replace the labor of more than two hundred people, supplying the production needs of twenty small blast furnaces.
    According to a report in the Liaoning Daily, Han Yongfu, a carpenter from the Hejiatun Gold Mine in Yingkou County, and three others recently trial-produced a twenty-foot ore crusher using wood. After two weeks of production, the results proved to be good.
    In iron and steel production, the crushing of iron ore currently occupies the most labor. The crusher manufactured by Han Yongfu and others can effectively solve this problem. A twenty-foot wooden crusher, powered by a twenty-horsepower diesel engine and operated by twelve workers per shift, can crush 129,600 catties of ore per day, replacing the labor of 260 workers, with a production efficiency eleven times higher than manual operation.
    This crusher has a hardwood structure. The wooden frame has twenty feet, with an iron hammer installed at one end of each foot. The lower part uses granite to create a small grooved trough. The ore is placed in the trough, and when the power is turned on, the feet pound the ore up and down. Each foot has a controller, and after the ore is crushed, it undergoes automatic screening to produce ore of a certain particle size. Each worker can operate five feet. To build such a crusher, no steel is needed, only two cubic meters of hardwood and 300 catties of iron, costing approximately 900 yuan. One such crusher can supply the ore needs of twenty 1.5 cubic meter small blast furnaces.
    Yingkou County recently held an on-site meeting to introduce this experience. According to calculations, if this crusher is promoted throughout the county, it can save more than 7,000 laborers per day.

    土法炼铁技术革新一大捷报
    营口创造土破碎机
    这种矿石破碎机可以代替二百多人的劳动，供应二十座小高炉的生产需要。
    据辽宁日报报道　营口县何家屯金矿木工韩永福等四人最近用木材试制出一台二十个立足的矿石破碎机。经过两周的生产，证明效果良好。
    在钢铁生产中，目前占用劳动力最多的是破碎铁矿石。采用韩永福等人制造的破碎机可以有效地解决这个问题。一台二十立足的木制破碎机用二十马力柴油机带动，每班十二名工人操作，一天可破碎十二万九千六百斤矿石，可以代替二百六十名工人的劳动，生产效率比手工操作提高十一倍。
    这种破碎机是硬质木材结构，木架设有二十个立足，立足一端安上铁锤；下部用花岗岩石作成小型带沿的对槽，矿石放在槽内，开动动力，立足便上下捣矿。每个立足都有控制器，将矿石捣碎后经过自动选筛，便生产出一定规格粒度的矿石。每个工人可以操纵五个立足。造一台这样的破碎机不用钢材，只用两立方公尺硬质木材，三百斤铁就行了，成本大约九百元左右。一台这样的破碎机，可以供应二十座一点五立方公尺小高炉的矿石需要。
    营口县最近召开现场会议介绍了这一经验。据计算，全县推广这种破碎机以后，一天可以节省七千多个劳动力。
