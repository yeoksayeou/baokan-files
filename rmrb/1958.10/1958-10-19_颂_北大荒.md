    Ode to "Beidahuang"
    Hua Ming
    After reading this special page, a beautiful picture of the enchanting "Beidahuang" immediately appears before us. Beidahuang is no longer barren. The fields there were once densely covered with golden wheat and soybeans. Like all parts of the country, this year's agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, more than doubling. There are herds of pigs, cattle, and horses, with the number of pigs tripling compared to last year. Teams of people are building reservoirs, wanting to make the reservoirs spread across this land like "stars in the sky" and "bunches of grapes." Tall chimneys have been erected in the sky, and many factories have been established. Especially after the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of striving for 10.7 million tons of steel, the people of "Beidahuang," together with the people of the whole country, are also working diligently for steel. They have built more than 80 small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces, producing more than 1,000 tons of iron... The people of "Beidahuang" have made a grand ambition to transform "Beidahuang" into a second Jiangnan, no, to surpass Jiangnan. They sing: "The reclamation army is a hundred thousand strong, red flags are planted on the Wandashan Mountains, hard work for three years will turn it into a granary, we want to make Jiangnan catch up with Mishan."
    Two years ago, "Beidahuang" was still a desolate place, especially in winter, with thousands of miles of ice and snow. People who came here for the first time not only had no place to live, but even had to carve out the roads themselves. In order to develop this wasteland, even in the severe winter, people began to fight against the wind and snow. They worked hard in strong winds and heavy snow, worked harder in light winds and light snow, and worked furiously when there was no wind or snow. Finally, with their heroic iron arms, they created a beautiful "Beidahuang."
    The changes in "Beidahuang" give us an enlightenment: the people of the socialist era are truly earth-shattering heroes. They dare to think about problems that predecessors did not dare to think about, and dare to do things that predecessors did not dare to do. "Beidahuang" has been dormant for thousands of years. In the past, no one dared to develop it into a second Jiangnan. Whoever stood beside it could only sigh: When will it wake up? But in just two years, under the heroic struggle, not only have crops grown, but also factories have been established. This is just as Chairman Mao Zedong said in his poem "Farewell to the God of Plague": "The spring breeze sends willows in thousands of strands, six hundred million in this land are all like Emperors Shun and Yao."
    In our country, there are many rich and beautiful regions like "Beidahuang." They not only have vast land, but also fertile soil; they not only have countless forests, but also rich treasures underground; they can not only develop agriculture and animal husbandry, but also develop industry. Some of these places are being developed, but very slowly, or the land is still dormant, waiting for people to awaken it.
    Going to those places will certainly encounter many difficulties, just like the people in "Beidahuang," without a place to live and without roads. But for people with lofty ideals, this is a small matter. If there are no houses, they will build them themselves; if there are no roads, they will carve them out themselves; if there is no food, they will grow it themselves. Difficulties will only scare away those without lofty ideals. The masses say: How big your "courage" is, how big things you can do. Isn't this "courage" a far-reaching ideal and a grand ambition?
    May more people go to develop those "treasure lands" in the border areas, and may more new and beautiful "Beidahuangs" appear throughout the country.

### 颂“北大荒”

    颂“北大荒”
    华明
    读了这个专页之后，在我们面前立刻呈现出一幅令人神往的“北大荒”的美丽的图景。北大荒已不荒了。那里田野里曾经密密地长满金黄色的麦子和大豆，同全国各地一样，今年农业生产获得了空前大丰收，翻了一番半。那里有成群的猪、牛、马，猪比去年增加了三倍。那里一队队的人正在修建水库，要使水库像“满天星”“葡萄串”一样地布满在这块大地上。那里天空中树立起了高大的烟囱，建立起了很多的工厂，特别在党中央提出为一千零七十万吨钢而斗争的口号以后，“北大荒”的人们也同全国人民一起在为钢铁而勤劳地工作着，他们已建立起小高炉土高炉八十多座，出铁一千多吨……。“北大荒”的人们，立下了宏伟的志愿，要把“北大荒”改造成为第二个江南，不，要超过江南，他们唱着：“垦荒大军兵十万，红旗插上完达山，苦战三年变粮仓，要叫江南赶密山。”
    两年以前呢，“北大荒”还是一个荒凉地方，尤其是冬天，千里冰封，万里雪飘。初到这里的人，不光没有住处，连道路都得要自己走出来。为了开发这个荒地，还是严寒的冬天，人们就开始同风雪斗争，他们是大风大雪苦干，小风小雪大干，无风无雪猛干。终于，用他们的英勇铁臂，创造出一个美丽的“北大荒”来。
    “北大荒”的变化，给我们一个启示：社会主义时代的人，真是翻天复地的英雄好汉。他们敢想前人不敢想的问题，敢做前人不敢做的事情。“北大荒”沉睡了几千年，过去，谁也没有胆子把它开发成为第二个江南。谁站在它的旁边只会叹息：它什么时候苏醒过来呢？可是仅仅两年的时间，在英雄好汉的奋战之下，不仅长出了庄稼，而且办起了工厂。这正如毛泽东同志在“送瘟神”诗中说的：“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”。
    在我们祖国，像“北大荒”这样富饶而美丽的地区是不少的，那里不仅有广阔的土地，而且土质肥沃；那里不仅有无数的森林，而且地底下有丰富的宝藏；那里不仅可以发展农业、畜牧业，而且可以发展工业。那些地方或者有人正在开发，但很迟缓，或者那些土地还在沉睡着，等待着人们去唤醒它。
    到那些地方去，当然也会遇到很多困难，像在“北大荒”的人们一样，没有住处，没有道路。但这对于具有崇高理想的人来说，是一件小事，没有房子自己修建，没有路自己走出来，没有粮食自己种。困难只会吓倒没有崇高理想的人。群众说：人有多大“胆”，就可办多大的事。这“胆”不就是远大的理想、宏伟的志愿吗？
    愿有更多的人去开发边疆那些“宝地”，愿全国出现更多的新的美丽的“北大荒”。
