Xinhua News Agency, October 20th, 11:30 AM: On October 19th, at 23:30, a U.S. dock landing ship was discovered intruding into our territorial waters in the Xiamen and Kinmen sea area. Subsequently, at 23:50, three U.S. destroyers were discovered in the same sea area, providing cover for the dock landing ship. At 23:45, a Chiang Kai-shek warship escorted several mechanical landing crafts from Kinmen towards these U.S. warships. These U.S. warships did not completely withdraw from our territorial waters until 4:48 on the 20th. A spokesman for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting on instructions, declared: Disregarding repeated warnings from the Chinese government, U.S. naval and air forces have continuously violated our territorial waters and airspace. This time, a dock landing ship and three destroyers intruded into our territorial waters in the Xiamen and Kinmen area, clearly providing escort for military transport to Kinmen by the Taiwan Kuomintang army. This is an extremely serious provocative incident after our announcement that Americans are prohibited from providing escorts in the Kinmen sea area. The Chinese government lodges its 36th serious warning against this.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: On October 20th, four U.S. destroyers again intruded into our territorial waters in the Pingtan and Matsu areas of Fujian Province. Regarding this U.S. military provocation, a spokesman for our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acting on instructions, lodges its 37th serious warning.

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st: From the night of October 19th to the morning of October 20th, a U.S. Navy dock landing ship, under the cover of three U.S. destroyers, intruded into our Xiamen and Kinmen sea area, providing escort for the Kuomintang army's military transport. After this extremely serious provocative incident was exposed, Lieutenant Commander Lempgin, a spokesman for the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, issued a statement on the 20th, attempting to deny it. However, he could not deny that a U.S. Navy dock landing ship was indeed engaged in transporting Kuomintang supply ships. At the same time, he insisted that the dock landing ship was not providing an escort and did not enter waters within at least fifteen nautical miles of Kinmen.

A spokesman for our Ministry of National Defense issued the following statement in response:

The serious provocative act of U.S. warships intruding into our Xiamen and Kinmen sea area to provide escort for Kuomintang supply ships cannot be denied in any way. We have conclusive evidence proving that the U.S. Navy dock landing ship "Oak Hill" arrived at a location six nautical miles south of Liaoluotou, Kinmen (24 degrees 18 seconds North latitude, 118 degrees 26 seconds East longitude) at 23:30 on the 19th, and penetrated deep into our territorial waters to engage in transporting Kuomintang supply ships. Subsequently, at 23:50, the U.S. destroyers McCain, J.W. Thomason, and Cogswell intruded into the same sea area, providing cover for this dock landing ship for as long as five hours. These activities of the U.S. warships undeniably constitute an escort for Kuomintang supply ships. Any denial by the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command can only be a futile attempt to conceal the truth.

### 美舰公然护航向我严重挑衅  我政府提出严重警告　国防部驳斥美国无耻抵赖

    美舰公然护航向我严重挑衅
    我政府提出严重警告　国防部驳斥美国无耻抵赖
    新华社20日十一时三十分讯　10月19日二十三时三十分，在厦门、金门海域发现美国船坞登陆舰一艘侵入我国领海，接着在二十三时五十分，在同一海域又发现美国驱逐舰三艘侵入我国领海，对该艘船坞登陆舰进行掩护。在二十三时四十五分有蒋舰一艘护送机械登陆艇数艘从金门向这些美国军舰驶去。这些美国军舰直到20日四时四十八分才全部退出我国领海。我外交部发言人奉命声明：美国海、空军不顾我国政府的连续警告，不断侵犯我国领海和领海上空，这次竟以一艘船坞登陆舰和三艘驱逐舰侵入我厦门、金门地区的领海，显然是为台湾国民党军队向金门的军事运输进行护航。这是在我国宣布金门海域美国人不得护航之后的极其严重的挑衅事件。中国政府对此第三十六次提出严重警告。
    新华社20日讯　10月20日，美国驱逐舰四艘又侵入我福建省平潭、马祖地区的领海。对于美国这种军事挑衅，我外交部发言人奉命第三十七次提出严重警告。
    新华社21日讯　10月19日夜至20日晨，美国海军船坞登陆舰一艘，在三艘美国驱逐舰的掩护下，侵入我厦门、金门海域，为国民党军队的军事运输进行护航。在这一极其严重的挑衅事件被揭露以后，侵台美军司令部发言人勒姆普金海军中校竟在20日发表声明，企图抵赖。但是，他不能不承认确实有一艘美国海军船坞登陆舰担任接送国民党供应船只的工作。同时，他又硬说，这艘船坞登陆舰不是进行护航，也没有开进离金门至少有十五浬的海面。
    我国防部发言人为此发表谈话如下：
    美国军舰侵入我厦门、金门海域，为国民党的供应船只进行护航的严重挑衅行为，是无论如何抵赖不了的。我们掌握的确凿材料证明，美国海军船坞登陆舰“橡树山”号（Oak　Hill）在19日二十三时三十分驶抵我金门料罗头正南六浬多的地方（北纬二十四度十八秒，东经一百一十八度二十六秒），深入我领海进行接送国民党供应船只的活动；接着，在二十三时五十分，美国驱逐舰麦克凯恩号（McCain）、汤马逊号（J·W·Thomason）、科格斯威尔号（Cogswell）三艘侵入同一海域，对这艘船坞登陆舰进行掩护，达五小时之久。美国军舰的这些活动，无可否认地构成了对国民党供应船只的护航。侵台美军司令部的任何抵赖，只能欲盖弥彰。
