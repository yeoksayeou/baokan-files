Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first large planetarium projector in China was born at the Beijing Institute of Technology. On the 9th, after preliminary tests, all parts of this most complex and ingenious instrument were operating normally.

The large planetarium projector is an optical instrument representing one of the world's cutting-edge technologies. It consists of over a hundred sets of optical systems and more than ten thousand precision mechanical parts. Currently, only the Carl Zeiss factory in the German Democratic Republic produces them. Young teachers, students, and staff of the Instrument Manufacturing Department of the Beijing Institute of Technology, after fighting hard for three months, independently designed and manufactured a large planetarium projector, marking that China's optical instrument manufacturing industry has climbed to the world's scientific peak.

Engineers from the Beijing Planetarium, after visiting the large planetarium projector, considered its performance to be excellent. They said that it took the United States four years to imitate the Zeiss factory's large planetarium projector, and the quality was very poor. Japan has been imitating it for more than two years and has not yet completed it. The Beijing Institute of Technology made it in just three months, which is unprecedented.

The main instrument of the large planetarium projector made by the Beijing Institute of Technology is about four meters long. It can project astronomical phenomena such as the movement of stars, the sun, and planets, the waxing and waning of the moon, etc. It can also project eight thousand stars of the fifth magnitude or brighter while projecting these astronomical phenomena. The middle part of the planetarium projector consists of an electric motor and many gears to form a transmission system, which can project an artificial starry sky and its operation and changes on a hemispherical screen with a radius of eight to twelve meters. Two large copper balls are installed at both ends to radiate stars; the part between the middle section and the two balls is equipped with seven cages to show the special starry sky phenomena such as the interrelationship of planetary movements. This large planetarium projector fully possesses the advantages of the large planetarium projector manufactured by the Zeiss factory in terms of performance. At the same time, it is simpler in structure and slightly smaller in size than the Zeiss factory's, making it more suitable for medium-sized planetariums in medium-sized cities. It can also be used for large planetariums in large cities. The projected stars can also flash, and it can also reflect the twenty-four solar terms of the Chinese lunar calendar.

Under the leadership of the Party, the more than three hundred young teachers, students, and staff who participated in the design and manufacture of the planetarium projector overcame many difficulties and successfully trial-produced it in a short period of time. The entire instrument mechanism and more than ten thousand precision parts were all made by themselves using indigenous equipment. On the master copy of the large planetarium projector used to project the artificial starry sky, the coordinate position of each star point must be determined after complex mathematical calculations. The young teachers and students painstakingly studied and created a new calculation method, and completed this complex and huge calculation in twenty days of hard work. This is even shorter than the time the United States used electronic computers to calculate (including all the preparatory work before the calculation).

In the past, China relied on imports for large planetarium projectors. The Beijing Institute of Technology will formally start production to meet the needs of China's great leap forward in science and technology.

### 光学仪器工业攀登世界科学顶峰  北京制出大型天象仪

    光学仪器工业攀登世界科学顶峰
    北京制出大型天象仪
    据新华社讯　我国第一台大型天象仪在北京工业学院诞生了。9日，经初步试验，这台最复杂、最巧妙的仪器的各个机件均运转正常。
    大型天象仪是世界尖端技术之一的光学仪器，共有一百多套光学系统和一万多个精细的机械零件，目前世界上主要有德意志民主共和国蔡斯工厂一家进行生产。北京工业学院仪器制造系青年师生和职工奋战三个月，自己设计和制造成功大型天象仪，标志着我国光学仪器制造工业已攀上了世界科学的顶峰。
    北京天文馆的工程师们参观了大型天象仪后认为这架天象仪性能良好。他们说美国仿蔡斯工厂制造的大型天象仪，共用四年时间，质量很差，日本仿制二年多还未制成。北京工业学院用短短三个月时间制成是史无前例的。
    北京工业学院制成的大型天象仪，主要仪器长度约四公尺，它能放映的天文现象有：恒星、太阳、行星的运行，月亮的盈亏等，还能在放映这些天文现象的同时放映八千个五等星以上的星星。天象仪的中间部分由电动机和许多齿轮组成一个传动系统，可以在半径为八公尺至十二公尺的半球形天幕上放映出一个人造星空和它的运转、变化的情况；两头装有两个大铜球用来放射恒星；中段与两球之间的部分装有七个笼子用来表演行星的相互运行关系等特殊星空现象。这台大型天象仪在性能上完全具备了蔡斯工厂制造的大型天象仪的优点，同时，在结构上较蔡斯厂的简单、形体稍小，更适合中等城市的中型天文馆使用，也可用于大城市的大型天文馆，放射出来的星体还可以闪动，它还能反映我国农历上的二十四节气。
    参加设计和制造天象仪的三百多青年师生和职工，在党的领导下，克服了许多困难，在短期内试制成功。整个仪器的机构和一万多个精细的零件，都是他们自己动手，利用土设备制造的。大型天象仪中放映人造星空的底版上，每一颗星点座标位置，都要经过复杂的数学计算后确定，青年师生们苦心钻研，创造了一种新的计算方法，苦战二十天就完成了这个复杂庞大的计算。比美国利用电子计算机计算（包括计算前的一切准备工作）的时间还短。
    我国使用的大型天象仪过去靠进口，北京工业学院将正式进行生产，满足我国科学技术大跃进的需要。
