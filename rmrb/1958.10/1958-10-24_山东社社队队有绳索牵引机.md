Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd: Shandong Province, after a month of intensive effort, has popularized over 600,000 rope-drawn traction machines, basically covering all communes and production teams in the province. In some areas, rope-drawn traction machines are already being used for major agricultural tasks such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, rolling, harvesting, and digging. Over 70 counties and cities, including Zhaoyuan, Huangxian, Shouzhang, and Fanxian, have achieved rope-drawn traction plowing. Currently, the people of the province are still very enthusiastic about promoting rope-drawn traction machines, advancing at a rate of 50,000 units per day.

During the promotion process, various localities first deeply mobilized the masses, promptly resolving ideological concerns. Initially, a significant number of people believed that rope-drawn traction machines were not very effective or efficient; others believed that while they were useful, they feared a shortage of materials and manpower, and were daunted by the difficulties. Leading cadres went deep into the grassroots to cultivate model examples, commend the advanced, promote the backward, and used methods of clarifying through debate those who did not understand, learning by observing those who did not know how, and experimenting for those who did not believe, so that cadres had red flags planted in their minds and learned the technology. In the nearly 20 days before October 5th, only over 100,000 units were promoted throughout the province; after resolving the various ideological concerns hindering the promotion work, this number increased to 470,000 units by the 15th.

The second problem encountered during the promotion was a lack of materials and labor. However, these difficulties were overcome by the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. In many places, the masses spontaneously offered to provide whatever was needed and actively contributed materials. In Shouzhang County, the masses contributed 23,000 jin of hemp and 2 million jin of timber and other materials in twelve days. To solve the problem of insufficient labor, various localities adopted effective methods such as rational arrangements and organizing "winch armies."

### 山东社社队队有绳索牵引机

    山东社社队队有绳索牵引机
    据新华社济南23日电　山东省奋战一个月，推广绳索牵引机六十多万部，全省所有社、队基本普及。有些地方已能把绳索牵引机运用到耕、耙、播种、砘轧、收刨等主要农活上。招远、黄县、寿张、范县等七十多个县、市已经实现耕犁绳索牵引化。现在全省人民推广绳索牵引机的劲头仍然很大，每天正以五万部的速度向前推进。
    各地在推广中首先深入发动群众，及时解决一些思想顾虑。开始，有相当一部分人认为绳索牵引机作用不大，效率不高；另一些人认为虽有作用，但怕料物不足，人手缺少，畏难发愁。领导干部就深入下层培养典型，表扬先进，促进落后，用不通就辩，不会就看，不信就试验的方法，使干部在思想上插上了红旗，学会了技术。全省在10月5日前近二十天中，仅推广十万多部；解决了阻碍推广工作的种种思想顾虑后，到15日就增加到四十七万部。
    推广中碰到的第二个问题是料物缺乏，劳力不足。可是这些困难都被群众的革命干劲冲破了。许多地方的群众自动提出要啥有啥、积极献料。寿张县群众在十二天中献出麻二万三千斤，木料等两百万斤。解决劳力不足问题，各地采用的有效办法是合理安排，组织“绞关大军”。
