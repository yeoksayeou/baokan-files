Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 7th: The spokesman for the Information Department of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic said here on the 6th that De Gaulle's speech in Constantine on October 3rd was a repetition of the old hopes he put forward in 1943, attempting to suppress the united Algerian national movement. However, in the face of the Algerian people's united determination to fight for independence, this hope has been clearly defeated.

The spokesman said that De Gaulle's plan is already fifteen years old, and it constitutes a real political anachronism. This firm refusal to comply with historical facts proves that De Gaulle is continuing to pursue France's traditional imperialist policy.

The spokesman pointed out that De Gaulle's speech was based on the voting activities organized by the French army in Algeria, and the results of this activity only show the wishes of the French army and do not explain anything else. This referendum does not bind anyone outside of France, and it has nothing to do with the Algerian people.

The spokesman said that the Algerian people's desire is freedom and national independence, and they have demonstrated this desire and determination through armed struggle against French imperialism. The spokesman concluded by saying that France has no other way out than to respect the wishes of the Algerian people and recognize their independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 6th: The "Voice of the Algerian Republic" program broadcast by the "Voice of the Arabs" radio station on the 5th commented on the speech made by French Prime Minister De Gaulle in Constantine, Algeria, saying that De Gaulle showed that, like other French politicians, he insisted on indefinitely continuing the Algerian war, which was the main reason for the collapse of the Fourth French Republic and the cause of France's current crisis, and also a serious threat to international security and peace.

The commentary emphasized that no matter what tricks De Gaulle plays, the Algerian people are determined to fight for a just cause, to fight for freedom and independence, and to fight to maintain their glory and national dignity. The commentary said that De Gaulle's insistence on carrying out a colonialist war against Algeria is shooting himself in the foot. Those who do evil will eventually suffer the consequences.

    阿尔及利亚独立决心不可动摇
    临时政府发言人斥戴高乐坚持殖民政策
    新华社开罗7日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府宣传部的发言人6日在这里说，戴高乐10月3日在君士坦丁发表的演说是重复他在1943年提出的陈旧的指望，企图镇压团结一致的阿尔及利亚民族运动。但是，在阿尔及利亚人民团结一致和争取独立的决心面前，这种指望已经遭到了明显的失败。
    这位发言人说，戴高乐的计划已经有十五年的历史，它造成真正的政治上的时代错误，这种坚决拒绝顺应历史事实的态度证明，戴高乐正在继续奉行法国传统的帝国主义政策。
    这位发言人指出，戴高乐的演说是以法国军队在阿尔及利亚组织的投票活动为基础的，这种活动的结果除了表明法国军队的愿望以外，不说明任何问题。这次公民投票约束不了法国以外的任何人，它与阿尔及利亚人民无关。
    这位发言人说，阿尔及利亚人民的愿望是自由和民族独立，他们通过向法国帝国主义者进行的武装斗争已经表明他们的这种愿望和决心。发言人最后说，法国除了尊重阿尔及利亚人民的愿望和承认他们的独立以外，没有别的出路。
    据新华社开罗6日电　“阿拉伯之声”电台5日广播的“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”的节目就法国总理戴高乐在阿尔及利亚君士坦丁发表的演说发表评论说，戴高乐表明，他同其他法国政客一样，坚持要无限期地进行阿尔及利亚战争，而这场战争是法兰西第四共和国垮台和造成法国目前危机的主要原因，也是对国际安全和和平的严重威胁。
    评论强调说，不管戴高乐玩弄什么诡计，阿尔及利亚人民决心为正义的事业进行斗争，为实现自由和独立进行斗争，为保持自己的光荣和民族尊严而进行斗争。评论说，戴高乐坚持进行对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义战争，是推石头砸自己的脚。作恶者必将自食其果。（附图片）
