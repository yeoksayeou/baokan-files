    A Suite Singing the Great Leap Forward
    ——Review of the Documentary “Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, Students, and Merchants”
    Xu Xiaobing
    The documentary “Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, Students, and Merchants,” through five short films: “Iron Flowers in Full Bloom,” “Agricultural Satellites Soaring,” “Everything for the Customer,” “Straight to the Clouds,” and “Under the Banner of Defending the Motherland,” reflects the leaping progress on the fronts of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants. It can be said to be a microcosm of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction.
    “Iron Flowers in Full Bloom” takes the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation as its subject matter, focusing on the construction of WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace and the intense battle to produce iron ahead of schedule. Seeing a film with this theme during these times of全民炼钢铁 (all people making steel) is extremely inspiring. The film devotes considerable space to portraying the workers' selfless struggle, as well as the Party's encouragement and care for them. Among them, the scenes of workers laboring intensely under the scorching sun and in the pouring rain, as well as the scene of Chairman Mao inspecting WISCO and the jubilation of ten thousand people, are particularly exciting. The filmmakers used simple techniques to illustrate the central idea: WISCO's ability to go into production nine months ahead of schedule is an unprecedented victory; and such a victory was achieved under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, with the workers summoning soaring enthusiasm and overcoming various difficulties. Unfortunately, the filmmakers were not bold enough or detailed enough in their characterizations. For example, the group of shots depicting the workers struggling in extremely difficult environments failed to fully express their tenacious and unyielding iron will. In addition, shortcomings such as the lack of full close-ups and the relatively rigid camera angles also affected the film's screening effect.
    "Agricultural Satellites Soaring" is a report of great bumper harvests in agricultural production. This film brings together scenes of Guangdong launching mid-season rice satellites, Shandong launching millet and corn satellites, Anhui launching grape satellites, and large-scale bumper harvests of cotton, sorghum, and other crops in other regions, giving people the feeling that "agricultural satellites are soaring everywhere." The robust and plump rice grains, the nearly one-foot-long golden corn, and the crystal-clear, round bunches of grapes are miracles created by the peasant brothers and sisters after breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and working hard. In the past, some people thought that such high yields were an impossible dream, but now, we have seen with our own eyes on the screen that this is a fact. The film is simple and vivid. Although it expresses the same theme of bumper harvests, it does not give people a repetitive and monotonous feeling.
    "Straight to the Clouds" depicts the enthusiasm of teachers and students at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics in building their own aircraft. The film's focus is on presenting difficulties from the front, overcoming difficulties, and even conquering difficulties, which makes the film not only have a quite clear theme but also avoids falling into the trap of generalization in artistic treatment. When introducing characters, the film grasps their mental state very well, and the angle positions are also chosen very appropriately.
    The other two short films, "Everything for the Customer" and "Under the Banner of Defending the Motherland," the former reflects the Great Leap Forward in commercial work, and the latter reports on the combat dynamics of our powerful People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force on the Fujian front, showing the boundless ambition of the people's soldiers to defend the motherland and world peace. These two short films also reflect exciting themes and events. Together with the other three short films, they form a suite singing the socialist Great Leap Forward. The magnificent and beautiful picture it depicts gives us great strength and encouragement.

    歌唱大跃进的一支组曲
    ——评纪录片“工农兵学商”
    徐肖冰
    纪录片“工农兵学商”通过“铁花怒放”、“农业卫星满天飞”、“一切为了顾客”、“直上云霄”、“在保卫祖国的旗帜下”等五部短片，反映了工农兵学商等战线上的跃进景象，可以说是我国社会主义建设事业大跃进的一幅缩影。
    “铁花怒放”以武汉钢铁公司的建设为题材，以武钢第一号高炉的修建和一切为了提前出铁的紧张战斗为主要情节。在这全民炼钢铁的时日里，看到这样题材的影片，使我们万分振奋。影片以相当篇幅表现了工人的忘我奋斗的情景，也表现了党对他们的鼓励和关怀。其中工人们在灼热的阳光下和在倾盆大雨中紧张劳动的场面，以及毛主席视察武钢万人欢腾的情景，是特别激动人心的。影片作者以朴素的手法，阐明了这样的中心思想：武钢能比原计划提前九个月投入生产，这是史无前例的巨大胜利；而这样的胜利，是在党和毛主席的英明领导下，工人们鼓起了冲天干劲，战胜了各种困难，才取得的。可惜作者在人物刻划方面，却嫌不够大胆，也不够细致，譬如描写工人们在极艰苦的环境中苦战的那一组镜头，就没有能够把人们那种顽强不屈的钢铁意志充分地表现出来。此外，特写镜头不够饱满和摄影角度比较呆板等缺点，也影响了影片映出的效果。
    “农业卫星满天飞”是一份关于农业生产大丰收的捷报。这部片子把广东放射中稻卫星、山东放射谷子和玉米卫星、安徽放射葡萄卫星的情景，以及其它地区的棉花、高粮等大面积丰收的景象，汇编在一起，集中地反映出来，真给人“农业卫星满天飞”的感觉。那颗粒壮实肥大的稻子，那差不多有一尺长的黄澄澄的玉米，那水晶一样莹泽的累累成球的葡萄，是农民弟兄们破除迷信、解放思想、苦干硬干后创造出的奇迹。过去有人认为这样的高额丰产是不可能实现的梦想，但现在，我们却从银幕上亲眼看到了这是事实。影片拍摄得简洁而且生动。虽然表现的都是同一的丰产题材，但并不给人重复单调的感觉。
    “直上云霄”描写了北京航空学院师生自制飞机的干劲。影片的着眼点，放在从正面提出困难、克服困难，以至战胜困难方面，就使得影片不但具有了相当鲜明的主题思想，而且在艺术处理上，也不致陷入一般化的圈套。影片介绍人物时，对于人物的精神状态掌握得很好，角度位置也选取得很合适。
    其它两部短片“一切为了顾客”和“在保卫祖国的旗帜下”，前者反映了商业工作的大跃进；后者报道了我们强大的人民解放军陆海空军在福建前线的战斗动态，显示了人民战士保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的无比的壮志雄心。这两部短片，同样反映的是激动人心的主题和事件。它们和其它三部短片一起，汇成了一支歌唱社会主义大跃进的组曲。它所描绘的那种壮丽美妙的图景，给了我们莫大的力量和鼓舞。
