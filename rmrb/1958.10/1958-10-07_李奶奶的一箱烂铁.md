    Grandma Li would pick up any nail or piece of scrap copper she came across while walking, carefully putting it in a specific place. Drop by drop, a river forms; as days went by, she accumulated a whole box full. Grandpa Li once said, "Sell it and get some money..." Before he could finish, Grandma Li interrupted, "We're not lacking food or clothes now, why sell it? It's not like it's bothering you." Grandpa Li had no choice but to remain silent.
    One day, the neighborhood held a meeting to convey the government's call to purchase scrap copper and iron to ensure the "marshal" of steel could ascend the stage. As soon as the meeting ended, Grandma Li hurriedly ran home.
    As soon as she got home, she lit the lamp and moved the box of "treasures" out; she also rummaged behind the wardrobe, finding the broken pot, rusty spatula, leaky copper kettle, water ladle, and broken fire poker that had been unused for years.
    Grandpa Li stepped in the door, startled for a moment: "What's with this big cleaning at night?"
    After Grandpa Li heard the explanation, he smacked his lips and said, "Hey, this is a good thing! Come on, I'll help you." Saying that, he rolled up his sleeves and helped Grandma Li load the scattered copper and scrap iron on the ground into three full hemp sacks, pushed them onto a small flatbed cart, and pulled it in front. Grandma Li pushed behind, "Clang, clang," all the way to the recycling station.
    Grandma Li took the money from the recycling worker, greeted Grandpa Li, and walked straight to the street office.
    The office was lit, and Grandma Li solemnly handed the thirty-five yuan, without keeping a penny, to Comrade Wang: "Please send it to the comrades at the front line in Fujian!"

    李奶奶的一箱烂铁
    李奶奶平时走路碰到一个钉子，或一片烂铜，都要拣起来，很小心的放在一定地方。滴水成河，日子久了，竟也积存了满满一箱子。李大爷曾经说过：“把它卖了，换几个钱。……”话没落音，李奶奶插进来说：“现在不缺吃，不少穿的，卖它干啥，又不累你的事。”李大爷只好不吱声。
    那一天，街道上开会，传达政府提出收购废铜、废铁、保证钢铁“元帅”升帐的号召。会刚散，李奶奶就急急忙忙跑回家去。
    一到家，就点着灯，把那箱“宝贝”搬了出来；又钻到衣柜后面，将好几年不用的破锅、烂?、漏铜壶、水瓢、断火柱统统翻腾出来。
    李大爷跨进门来，楞了一下：“怎么黑夜大扫除？”
    李大爷听了原委，拍了一下巴掌，说：“嗨，这是好事嘛，来，我帮助你。”说着，卷起袖筒，帮李奶奶将地上的碎铜，烂铁，装了满满三麻袋，抬到小平车上，在前面拉着。李奶奶在后面推着，“叽哩哐?”的，走到收购站。
    李奶奶从收购员手里，接过钱，和李大爷招呼了一声，径向街道办事处走去。
    办公室亮着灯光，李奶奶把三十五块钱，一分没留，郑重地交给王同志：“把它寄给福建前线的同志们吧！”
