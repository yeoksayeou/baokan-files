Launching a "Huaihai Campaign" on the Iron and Steel Front
    Shandong Establishes a Fixed Iron and Steel Contingent and Base; Shanxi Launches a Competition to Organize High-Yield Iron and Steel Production Week
    Jiangxi Determined to Produce 150,000 Tons of Iron in October; Guizhou Sums Up Experience to Definitely Break Through the 10,000-Ton Barrier
    Henan Decides to Combine "Satellite" Launching with Normal Production

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th - The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to organize a four-million-strong professional iron and steel contingent to wholeheartedly engage in iron and steel production. This is a new measure they have taken to comprehensively arrange rural labor and ensure the simultaneous leap forward in iron and steel and agricultural production.

    The Provincial Committee requires all localities, after allocating a portion of their labor force to form the iron and steel contingent, to use the remaining majority of their labor force to seize the autumn harvest and planting and farmland water conservancy construction work, resolutely ensuring that iron and steel are the key to driving the overall leap forward in grain, machinery, and other tasks.

    In order to further organize iron and steel production, the Shandong Provincial Committee convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal committees from the 6th to the 8th to summarize the achievements and experiences of the province's iron and steel production over the past two months, and to make arrangements for future work. The meeting decided to designate Linyi, Laiwu, Yi County, Zibo, Zhangqiu, and Weifang, which have coal and mineral resources, as the province's iron and steel bases. Iron and steel, mining, and transportation companies will be organized in these areas to ensure the normal production of iron and steel.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th - The Secretariat of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal committees on October 7th to deploy the "Huaihai Campaign" on iron and steel production in October. The meeting determined that from October 15th to October 21st, a high-yield week for iron and steel production should be launched throughout the province to ensure a steady leap forward in iron and steel production. During this high-yield week, the average daily output of steel is required to reach more than 6,000 tons, and the average daily output of iron is required to reach more than 15,000 tons.

    The meeting required all localities to immediately start preparing for the high-yield week and to make overall arrangements for labor according to local conditions. The meeting called on all localities to organize socialist competitions between furnaces, between communes, between counties, and between factories. Everyone should strive to win the red flag, support each other, promote each other, and improve together. At the same time, safety education should be carried out in iron and steel production, and effective measures should be taken to prevent accidents and ensure safe production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th - The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee and a telephone conference to review and summarize the iron and steel production situation in September and to deploy the iron and steel production tasks for the next three months, especially October. The Provincial Committee demanded that the task of producing 150,000 tons of iron in October be resolutely completed, and that the combination of shock production and normal production be achieved so that the daily output of pig iron in the province is stabilized at more than 5,000 tons and increases day by day.

    In order to fight this battle well in October, the Provincial Committee requires all localities to take the following measures: First, the masses must fully understand the significance of the whole people running iron and steel. Fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Second, all efforts must be made to seek methods to increase the daily output of iron and steel production in a faster, better, and more economical way. Third, all counties must conduct experiments on using various types of coal to replace charcoal, and at the same time mobilize the masses to organize special coal mining teams to mine coal to prepare sufficient fuel for the iron smelting furnaces for the winter. Fourth, improve transportation conditions. Fifth, strengthen communist cooperation.

    The Provincial Committee believes that in October, in addition to focusing on pig iron production, all localities must also focus on the task of steel production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 11th - Guizhou Province is organizing the province's iron and steel production army to catch up quickly, striving to become a province with a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron on the 20th. From October 5th to 9th, Guizhou Province gathered more than 200 commanders from the front lines of iron and steel production in 82 counties and cities in Zunyi Prefecture, which has already achieved abundant production experience, and held a conference on launching pig iron production satellites.

    The representatives visited some iron smelting furnaces in Zunyi County, which had already achieved a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron, and listened to the experience introduction of Xishui County, the first county in the province to achieve a daily output of 1,000 tons of pig iron.

    Through visits and discussions, the representatives greatly developed the dare-to-think and dare-to-do communist style and expressed their determination to break through the 10,000-ton barrier in the province on October 20th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th - The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened an emergency meeting on iron and steel production in the province, demanding that all localities in the province continue to thoroughly implement the "small, indigenous, mass" policy, comprehensively break through the technical barriers in iron and steel production, and ensure the completion of the production of 800,000 tons of iron and 200,000 tons of steel in October. The meeting believes that based on the practical situation in September, the people have inexhaustible potential, and as long as leadership is strengthened and the masses are fully mobilized, it is entirely possible to complete and overfulfill the iron and steel production plan. The meeting called for a comprehensive breakthrough in production technology; to launch satellites on a large scale, continuously launch satellites, and comprehensively launch satellites. It is necessary to combine satellite launching with normal production. Political and technical work must be well integrated.

    The meeting required all localities to fully mobilize the masses, quickly determine the local superior furnace type, mine ore on a large scale, pan for iron sand on a large scale, and vigorously rectify transportation work. In terms of labor organization, the method of "professional team plus shock force" should be adopted to establish a permanent and fixed team; strengthen coordination and unified command. And with cadres, Party members, League members, and veteran workers as the backbone, a technical team of 100,000 people should be trained.
