    Red Scarf Sugar Factory
    More than 1,100 Young Pioneers in Lucheng Township, Daxing District, Beijing, launched a "Hundred Jin of Dry Grass" campaign in their spare time. With the money earned from collecting grass, they established a sugar factory that produces 1,200 jin of sugar daily. The township Party committee named the factory "Red Scarf Sugar Factory."
    How was this sugar factory established?
    This year on Children's Day, June 1st, the township Party secretary explained the General Line to the Young Pioneers, saying that their township was going to build thirty-eight factories. They thought, "We Young Pioneers shouldn't lag behind either!" They also wanted to contribute their strength to building a beautiful socialism.
    After the Young Pioneers discussed it, they decided to use their labor income to build a sugar factory in the township. Under the leadership of the township Communist Youth League committee, they launched a campaign to collect one hundred jin of dry grass per person. They proposed: Work hard for three days, work intensely for five days, compete for two days, compare enthusiasm, compare quality, and ensure that collecting grass and studying are not neglected. On June 3rd, the Young Pioneers of the entire township took action, going out to collect grass in their spare time every day. The Young Pioneers of each school were full of energy, putting forward the slogan: "Our enthusiasm for collecting grass is great, we don't go home until the sun sets; strive to collect one more basket of grass to realize industrialization." The Young Pioneers of the entire township spent twelve days of extracurricular time collecting more than 200,000 jin of grass, selling it for 2,780 yuan. On June 25th, the Young Pioneers of the entire township held a grand meeting, presenting the money to the township Party committee and holding a groundbreaking ceremony for the factory. Now, the factory buildings of the Red Scarf Sugar Factory have been built and production will begin soon.

    红领巾制糖厂
    北京市大兴区卢城乡的一千一百多个少先队员在课余时间展开了百斤干草运动，用打草换来的钱办了一个每日生产一千二百斤糖的制糖厂。乡党委把这个厂命名为“红领巾制糖厂”。
    这个糖厂是怎样办起来的呢？
    今年“六一”儿童节的时候，乡党委书记给少先队员们讲了总路线，说他们乡要办三十八个工厂。他们想：“我们少先队员也不该落后啊！”他们也要为建设美好的社会主义贡献自己的力量。
    经过少先队员们研究以后，决定用自己劳动的收入在乡里办一个制糖厂。他们在乡团委的领导下开展了每人百斤干草运动。他们提出：苦干三天，大干五天，竞赛两天，比干劲，比质量，比打草学习两不误。6月3日全乡的少先队员就行动起来了，每天他们利用课余时间出去打草。各校的少先队员都干劲十足，大家提出：“我们打草干劲大，太阳不落不回家；力争多打一筐草，用来实现工业化”。全乡少先队员用了十二天的课外活动时间打草二十多万斤，卖了二千七百八十元。6月25日那一天，全乡少先队员开了一个大会，把这些钱献给了乡党委，举行了建厂开工典礼。现在红领巾糖厂的厂房已经建成了，不久就要开工生产。
