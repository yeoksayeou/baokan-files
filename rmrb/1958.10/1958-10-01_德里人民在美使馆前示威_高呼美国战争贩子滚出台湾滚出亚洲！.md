Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 29th - People of Delhi held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy this evening despite the rain, shouting slogans such as "U.S. War-Mongers, Get Out of Taiwan, Get Out of Asia!" and "Indian and Chinese People are Brothers!"

The demonstration team, led by Sundarlal, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, and Chandra, the Secretary-General, consisted of workers and people from all walks of life. They braved the rain, which soaked their clothes, parading through the main streets of Delhi, holding up the national flags of China and India, as well as placards with slogans such as "No Interference in Quemoy and Matsu." They shouted slogans along the way.

When the demonstration team arrived at the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Embassy tightly closed its iron gates.

Sundarlal handed a memorandum to an official of the U.S. Embassy standing in front of the gate, demanding that the United States "unconditionally and as soon as possible withdraw all its troops from Taiwan and neighboring areas." Sundarlal also read the memorandum in front of the gate.

The memorandum pointed out: "Taiwan and the neighboring islands are Chinese territory. Therefore, the presence of American troops in Taiwan constitutes a dangerous interference in the affairs of other countries."

The memorandum said: "There is an urgent need to withdraw all American troops from Taiwan while it is not too late." It said, "Because the key to peace in the Far East and the world lies there."

At this time, the demonstrators shouted slogans: "We will not allow war to happen again!" "American warmongers must stop!" "Indian and Chinese people are brothers!"

    德里人民在美使馆前示威
    高呼美国战争贩子滚出台湾滚出亚洲！
    新华社新德里29日电　德里人民今天傍晚冒雨在美国大使馆门前举行了示威，示威群众高呼“美国战争贩子滚出台湾、滚出亚洲！”“印中人民是兄弟！”等口号。
    由全印和平理事会主席森德拉尔和秘书长钱德拉率领的由工人和各界人士组成的示威队伍，高举着中国和印度两国的国旗以及写着“不许干涉金门和马祖”等口号的标语牌，不顾雨水湿透衣服，在德里各主要街道上游行，并且沿途高呼口号。
    在示威队伍到达美国大使馆时，美国大使馆把它的铁门紧紧关上。
    森德拉尔把一项要求美国“无条件地和尽快地把它的所有军队撤出台湾和邻近地区”的备忘录交给站在门前的美国大使馆官员，森德拉尔还在门前宣读了备忘录。
    备忘录指出：“台湾和邻近的岛屿是中国的领土。因此，美国部队驻在台湾构成了对他国事务的危险的干涉”。
  备忘录说：“有迫切需要在为时还不过晚的时候把全部美军撤离台湾”。它说，“因为远东和世界和平的关键就在那里”。
    这时候，示威群众高呼口号：“我们不允许再发生战争！”“美国战争狂人必须住手！”“印中人民是兄弟！”
