Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. While fiercely attacking steel production, Yunnan Province has also launched a mass copper smelting upsurge. Many special districts and counties already have thousands upon thousands of people going up the mountains to mine and build furnaces. In the Machangqing mining area of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture alone, more than 16,000 people are fighting day and night. By late September, the province had built more than 1,600 native furnaces, and more than 670 furnaces had been put into production, producing more than 610 tons of copper.

	On these copper smelting fronts, the first secretaries or secretaries of the county party committees are in command. They divided the copper smelting teams into five armies: mining, fuel, furnace construction, smelting, and transportation.  Heze County fought continuously for five days and built 103 furnaces. Then, after fighting hard for three days and nights, they put 19 furnaces into production, and the county's copper production jumped more than 20 times. On September 22, copper production exceeded three tons. Malipo County relied on the power of the masses to build a copper smelting plant with 42 factory buildings (grass huts) and 15 native furnaces in five days with an investment of only two yuan.  Daily production has reached about 1.5 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha. Hunan Province is launching a mass copper smelting campaign. By late September, the province had built 70 native copper smelting furnaces and smelted more than 20,000 catties of crude copper.

	On September 16, a native furnace in the Baifang Township Copper Mine in Changning County produced 1,100 catties of crude copper per day, and the quality of the copper was very good. This copper mine has more than 160 people who have produced more than 9,000 catties of crude copper and more than 160 tons of copper ore using indigenous methods. The Liaojiacun Township in Sangzhi County established a copper smelting plant in August and also smelted high-quality red copper. They use canning furnaces, and it only takes 30 minutes to smelt one furnace. It is estimated that 54 tons of red copper can be produced this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 5th. More than a dozen counties in Anhui Province are conducting native copper smelting. In recent days, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau has received samples of copper smelted by indigenous methods from the Bamoushan Copper Mine in Zongyang County, the Zishanling Copper Mine in Fanchang County, the Shatanjiao Copper Mine in Nanling County, the Tongshan Copper Mine in Guichi County, the Tongshan Copper Mine in Tongling County, the Tongguanshan Smelting Plant, and the 803 Geological Prospecting Team. Chemical tests have proven that the quality is very good.

	In order to help various localities break through the technical barriers of native copper smelting, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an on-site conference on native copper smelting in mid-September. At the conference, furnaces were built with bricks, mud, and other raw materials, and blister copper was smelted using wooden bellows, raw coal, and low-grade ore.  Crude copper was smelted using semi-foreign and semi-native furnaces.

    千军万马开山取铜
    云南湖南安徽掀起全民炼铜运动
    据新华社昆明电　云南省在猛攻钢铁的同时，又发起了一个群众性的炼铜高潮。许多专区和县已经有成千成万的人上山开矿建炉。大理白族自治州仅在马厂菁一个矿区，就有一万六千多人日夜苦战。到9月下旬，全省已建成土炉一千六百多座，有六百七十多座炉子已投入生产，产铜六百一十多吨。
    在这些炼铜阵地上，都由县委第一书记或书记挂帅。他们把炼铜队伍分别组成采矿、燃料、建炉、冶炼、运输等五路大军。会泽县连战五天，建炉一百零三座，接着又苦战三昼夜，使十九座炉子投入生产，全县铜的产量猛跃二十多倍。9月22日产铜三吨以上。麻栗坡县依靠群众的力量在五天内，只花两块钱的投资，就盖起了一座拥有四十二间厂房（草屋）和十五座土炉子的炼铜厂，每天的产量已达一吨半左右。
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省正在开展全民炼铜运动。到9月下旬，全省已建炼铜土炉七十座，炼出粗铜两万多斤。
    常宁县柏坊乡铜矿9月16日有一座土炉日产粗铜一千一百斤，铜的质量很好。这个铜矿有一百六十多人，用土法已生产粗铜九千多斤，铜矿砂一百六十多吨。桑植县廖家村乡在8月建立一座炼铜厂，也炼出了优质红铜。他们利用罐头炉，每炼一炉只要三十分钟，预计今年可产红铜五十四吨。
    据新华社合肥5日电　安徽省已有十多个县在进行土法炼铜。连日来，省冶金工业局收到了枞阳县拔茅山铜矿、繁昌县梓山岭铜矿、南陵县沙滩角铜矿、贵池县铜山铜矿、铜陵县铜山铜矿、铜官山冶炼厂和八○三地质勘察队等单位用土法炼出的铜的样品，经化验证明质量都很好。
    为了帮助各地突破对土法炼铜的技术关，中共安徽省委在9月中旬召开了一次土法炼铜现场会议，会议上用砖头、泥巴等原料砌成炉子，用木制的风箱、原煤、低品位矿石，炼出了冰铜，又用半洋半土的炉子炼出了粗铜。
