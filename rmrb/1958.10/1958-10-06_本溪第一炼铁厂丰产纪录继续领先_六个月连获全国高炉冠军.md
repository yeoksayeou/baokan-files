Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, October 5th: The Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, which has been awarded the high-yield red flag for five consecutive months, created another national record in September with an average utilization coefficient of 2.077, planting the high-yield red flag on an even higher peak.

    The average utilization coefficient of this iron and steel plant in August was 1.93, with a daily pig iron production of 1,264 tons. Through the efforts of the workers, the average utilization coefficient in September increased to 2.077, and the daily production of pig iron increased by more than 90 tons compared to August, with a total of more than 2,700 tons of pig iron produced more than in August. Including September, it has won the title of national blast furnace "champion" for six consecutive months, continuing to lead in the high-yield records of large and medium-sized blast furnaces.

    The two medium-sized blast furnaces of Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant were old blast furnaces that had been in use for more than 40 years, with very low daily output. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, its highest daily output once reached more than 400 tons, with an average utilization coefficient of only 0.628. After liberation, by 1957, the average daily output of the two blast furnaces had increased to more than 850 tons, and the utilization coefficient had increased to 1.33. In April of this year, after the Double-Anti Movement criticized the conservative thinking that old furnaces could not increase production, the advanced experience of strengthening the smelting intensity of blast furnaces was conscientiously implemented, which caused the pig iron production of the blast furnaces to rise sharply. By the end of August, the average utilization coefficient of the two blast furnaces continued to increase to 1.93, and the daily output increased by 400 tons compared to the average daily output in 1957.

    After the People's Daily published the news of the plant being awarded the high-yield red flag on September 9, the workers of iron smelting blast furnaces in various regions put forward the slogan of "Catch up with Benxi, surpass Benxi," and launched a friendly competition with the workers of this plant, which further motivated the workers' confidence in "creating high-yield satellites and maintaining the red flag." The blast furnace workers operating under high temperatures strengthened the cooperation between the three shifts, carefully maintained and repaired the blast furnaces, and continued to expand the air supply and strengthen the smelting intensity of the blast furnaces. The workers in the mine, ore dressing, coking, and sintering production units outside the factory also launched a competition to create favorable conditions for the blast furnaces. Open-pit mining workers boldly improved their operating methods, increasing the daily output of ore from 24,000 tons to about 30,000 tons. The ore dressing plant formed a collaborative army of dozens of work sections with thousands of people, which greatly improved the output and quality of fine ore powder. The workers in the coking and sintering workshops also tried to send the best quality coke and sintered ore to the blast furnace for smelting. Thus, after a month of hard work by the vast number of workers, the pig iron production of the blast furnace increased by 7% compared to August, and new daily production records were created seven times in a row.

    本溪第一炼铁厂丰产纪录继续领先
    六个月连获全国高炉冠军
    据新华社本溪5日电  五个月连插高产红旗的本溪第一炼铁厂，9月份又创造平均利用系数二点○七七的全国最高纪录，把高产红旗插上更高峰。
    这个炼铁厂8月份的平均利用系数是一点九三，日产生铁一千二百六十四吨。经过职工们的努力，9月份的平均利用系数提高到二点○七七，生铁的日产量比8月份增加九十多吨，全月比8月份多炼出二千七百多吨生铁。连同9月份在内，它已经连续六个月荣获全国高炉“冠军”的称号，在大中型高炉的丰产纪录中继续领先。
    本溪第一炼铁厂的两座中型高炉，原是使用了四十多年的陈旧的高炉，日产量很低。日伪统治时期，它的最高日产量曾经达到四百多吨，平均利用系数只有○点六二八；解放以后，到1957年两座高炉的平均日产量提高到八百五十多吨，利用系数提高到一点三三。今年4月，经过双反运动，批判了认为老炉子不能提高产量的保守思想以后，认真推行了加强高炉冶炼强度的先进经验，因而使高炉的生铁产量直线上升。到8月底，两座高炉的平均利用系数继续提高到一点九三，日产量比1957年的平均日产量增加了四百吨。
    人民日报9月9日刊登这个厂连插高产红旗的消息以后，各地炼铁高炉的职工提出了“赶本溪、超本溪”的口号，向这个厂的职工展开友谊竞赛，更加激励了职工们“创造高产卫星、保住红旗”的信心。在高温下操作的高炉工人，加强了三班之间的协作，精心地维护检修高炉，并且继续扩大送风量，加强高炉的冶炼强度；厂外的矿山、选矿、炼焦和团烧等生产单位的职工，也展开为高炉创造有利条件的竞赛活动。露天开采工人大胆改进操作方法，把矿石的日产量由过去的二万四千吨提高到三万吨左右；选矿厂组成包括数十个工段上千人的协作大军，使精矿粉产量和质量大大提高。炼焦和团烧车间的工人，也设法把质量最好的焦炭和烧结矿送给高炉冶炼。这样，经过广大职工一个月的奋战，终于使高炉的生铁产量又比8月份提高7％，并且接连七次创造了日产量的新纪录。（附图片）
