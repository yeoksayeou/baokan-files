Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 13th: The Arab League Council, at its meeting today, passed a resolution condemning the speech made by the Tunisian chief delegate at the meeting on the 11th. This meeting was the first held after a crisis arose due to a conflict between Tunisia and the United Arab Republic at the Council meeting on the 11th.

The representatives of both the United Arab Republic and Tunisia did not attend today's meeting. Tunisian chief delegate Chatti left Cairo this morning to return to Tunisia for instructions.

The resolution passed at today's meeting stated that the Council approved of the actions taken by the Chairman of the meeting to prevent Tunisian chief delegate Chatti from making a second speech at the meeting on the 11th, and "condemned and rejected the attacks made by the Tunisian chief delegate in his speech against the Arab League and one of its member states," and decided to remove from the documents the full text of Chatti's talk at the press conference, which was distributed to the League's member states.

The resolution also requested the Chairman of the Council and the Secretary-General of the League to invite the delegation of the United Arab Republic to continue to participate in the Council meetings.

At the Arab League Council meeting held on October 11th (the first time the Tunisian delegation participated in this meeting after Tunisia was admitted as a member of the League), Tunisian chief delegate Chatti said in his speech that the reason Tunisia had not participated in the Arab League in the past was because the League had become an organization that "implements a policy, serves a certain interest, and is dictated to by one member state."

The chief delegate of the United Arab Republic, Abdul Hamid Ghalib, immediately replied that the Tunisian representative's speech confirmed the reports of foreign news agencies. These reports said that someone was plotting a conspiracy against the United Arab Republic within the Arab League. He said that this made him believe that the Arab League was about to become a tool of destruction rather than a tool of construction. Therefore, the United Arab Republic delegation believed that there was no other way but to withdraw from the meeting. The delegation of the United Arab Republic then left the meeting.

Subsequently, Tunisian chief delegate Chatti requested to speak a second time, but was prevented by the Chairman of the meeting, the head of the Saudi Arabian delegation. The Chairman suggested holding a secret meeting of the chief delegates of the various countries. The meeting was adjourned.

That evening, Chatti held a press conference, reading two statements to reporters saying that the Tunisian delegation refused to attend the current session of the Arab League Council because relations between the United Arab Republic and Tunisia were strained and cooperation within the League was impossible.

Many reporters in Cairo questioned the Tunisian government's position. In response, Chatti admitted that Tunisia had accepted weapons from the United States and that Tunisia's policy was to cooperate with the West.

    阿拉伯联盟理事会通过决议
    指责突尼斯代表攻击阿联
    突尼斯代表团宣布退出本届会议
    据新华社开罗13日电　阿拉伯联盟理事会在今天举行的会议上通过决议，谴责突尼斯首席代表在11日会议上的发言。这次会议是在由于突尼斯和阿拉伯联合共和国之间在11日的理事会会议上发生冲突而引起危机之后举行的第一次会议。
    阿拉伯联合共和国和突尼斯的代表都没有出席今天的会议。突尼斯首席代表沙提今晨离开罗回突尼斯请示。
    今天会议通过的决议说，理事会赞成会议主席为阻止突尼斯首席代表沙提在11日的会议上作第二次发言所采取的行动，以及“指责并拒绝突尼斯首席代表的发言中对于阿拉伯联盟和这个联盟的一个会员国所作的攻击”，并且决定从文件中撤销沙提在记者招待会上发表的、分发给联盟成员国的谈话全文。
    决议并且要求理事会主席和联盟秘书长邀请阿拉伯联合共和国的代表团继续参加理事会会议。
    在阿拉伯联盟理事会在10月11日举行的会议（突尼斯代表团在突尼斯被接纳为联盟成员国以后第一次参加这个会议）上，突尼斯首席代表沙提在他的发言中说，突尼斯过去未参加阿拉伯联盟的原因，是因为这个联盟已经成为这样一个组织：它“执行着一种方针，为一种利益效劳，并且听命于一个会员国”。
    阿拉伯联合共和国首席代表阿卜杜勒·哈米德·加利卜立即回答说，突尼斯代表的发言证实了外国通讯社的报道。这些报道说，有人正在阿拉伯联盟内部策划着反对阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋。他说，这使他相信，阿拉伯联盟就要变成一个破坏的工具，而不是一个建设的工具。因此阿拉伯联合共和国代表团认为，除了退出会议之外，别无其他办法。接着阿拉伯联合共和国代表团就离开了会场。
    随后，突尼斯首席代表沙提又要求第二次发言，但是被大会主席、沙特阿拉伯代表团团长所阻止。这位大会主席建议举行各国首席代表的秘密会议。会议就这样休会了。
    当天晚上，沙提举行了记者招待会，向记者们宣读了两篇声明说，突尼斯代表团拒绝出席阿拉伯联盟理事会的本届会议，因为阿拉伯联合共和国和突尼斯之间的关系是紧张的，要在联盟内进行合作是不可能的。
    开罗许多记者对突尼斯政府的立场提出了质问，沙提在答复中承认，突尼斯接受了美国的武器，突尼斯的政策是同西方合作。
