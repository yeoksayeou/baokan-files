    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd - The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article today condemning the United States for continuing its aggressive provocations against China, saying that the Americans must leave Taiwan and that the Chinese people have the strength to strike any aggressor. China is supported by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all progressive mankind.
    The newspaper emphasized that the whole world sees the powerful strength of the Soviet Union. Let Dulles and his ilk listen to what Khrushchev said in his letter to Eisenhower!
    The "Naval Gazette" said in an article that the US ruling group, regardless of the angry protests of the American people and the people of the world, still does not stop provoking China in the Taiwan region. Eisenhower's recent speech at a press conference and Dulles's talks with Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan show that the United States continues to interfere in China's internal affairs, but the crimes of the United States are doomed to fail.
    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 23rd -
  The Argentine Mothers for Peace Committee, celebrating Mother's Day here, has collected thousands of signatures below a declaration from the Argentine Peace Committee to the Argentine government and parliament.
    The declaration demands the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Taiwan, Lebanon, and British troops from Jordan, and demands an immediate halt to nuclear testing. Two members of the Mothers for Peace Committee collected more than six hundred signatures in an hour and a half.
    The committee members traveled around the city all day in a propaganda carriage decorated with peace-seeking pictures. They called on people to sign the declaration, to support the struggle of the Chinese people, and to awaken the Argentine people to condemn the American aggression in Taiwan.
    The Argentine Mothers for Peace Committee issued a declaration to celebrate Mother's Day. The declaration called on Argentine mothers to oppose nuclear war in order to protect their children.

    苏联报纸警告杜勒斯之流
    美国干涉中国内政注定要失败
    阿根廷母亲征集签名要美军立即撤出台湾
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联“共青团真理报”今天发表文章，谴责美国继续对中国进行侵略挑衅说，美国人必须离开台湾，中国人民具有给任何侵略者以打击的强大力量。和中国在一起的有苏联及其他社会主义国家和全体进步人类。
    这家报纸强调指出，全世界都看到苏联拥有强大力量，让杜勒斯之流听一听赫鲁晓夫在致艾森豪威尔的信中所说的那些话罢！
    “海军报”在一篇文章中说，美国统治集团不顾美国普通人民和全世界人民的愤怒抗议，仍不停止在台湾地区对中国进行挑衅。艾森豪威尔最近在记者招待会上的演说和杜勒斯在台湾和蒋介石进行的谈判，说明美国继续干涉中国的内政，但是美国的罪行是注定要失败的。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯23日电
