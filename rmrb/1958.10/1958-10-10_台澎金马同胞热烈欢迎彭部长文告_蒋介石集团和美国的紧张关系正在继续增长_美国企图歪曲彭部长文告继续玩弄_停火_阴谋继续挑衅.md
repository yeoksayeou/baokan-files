    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Various sources indicate that the letter from our Minister of National Defense, Peng Dehuai, to compatriots in Taiwan has been warmly welcomed by military personnel and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. Following the temporary cessation of punitive shelling of Chiang's troops in Kinmen and other areas by our People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front on the 6th, a United Press International reporter reported from Kinmen on the same day that "You don't need to speak Chinese to notice that the atmosphere on this island has eased, and everyone is in a very happy mood." The reporter said that although the Kinmen Chiang military authorities did not publish Minister Peng Dehuai's message, the news of the cessation of shelling was "passed from one artillery position to another, and then passed to the beaches" among Chiang's troops. The Kinmen Chiang troops, who were forced to sell their lives for the American plot to use Chinese to fight Chinese, "felt happy" about the suspension of shelling, and their thinking was: "We can at least live for another week."

    In Taiwan, according to Agence France-Presse, Minister Peng Dehuai's message "caused a great sensation" in Taipei on the morning of the 6th.

    The Taiwan authorities have held a series of secret meetings in recent days. Chiang Kai-shek convened an emergency meeting on the 6th, gathering Chen Cheng, Zhang Qun, and other senior military and government personnel to study the message.

    When answering questions from a reporter from the American National Broadcasting Company on the 6th, Chiang Kai-shek said that the message was "completely a trick" and expressed that he would "ignore it."

    The Taiwan authorities' spokesperson, Shen Chi, also stated that the cessation of shelling was "playing an evil peace offensive" and was a "respite before launching a new offensive," etc. According to him, this "peace offensive" aims to "relax the morale of our military and civilians in Kinmen" and "sow discord" between the people of the Taiwan area and the United States.

    At the same time, the Taiwan authorities' spokesperson's remarks and their newspapers specifically emphasized what attitude the United States should take. Chiang Kai-shek emphasized that he would "rather risk continued shelling and blockade than allow the American ally to withdraw its escort." He demanded that the United States and the Taiwan authorities "continue to take a firm stand" and not "retreat." Taipei's "Central Daily News" demanded on the 7th that the United States interrupt the Sino-American talks in Warsaw. The newspaper said, "Any further negotiations will inevitably become a discussion about the United States withdrawing from the Western Pacific." Before the "Central Daily News" advocated this, Chiang Kai-shek himself, in an interview with a reporter from the British "Sunday Times," had already demanded the immediate cessation of the Warsaw talks.

    Taiwan authorities spokesman Shen Chi also called on "American allies not to be misled by the enemy's tricks" and "must further strengthen (US-Chiang) unity at this critical moment."

    On the same day that the U.S. State Department publicly announced the temporary cessation of escorting on the 8th, Bolk, the army chief of the U.S. military assistance advisory group in Taiwan, made it clear in Taipei that "any action taken by the United States towards Chiang Kai-shek's army is primarily for the benefit of the United States," and "We will not do anything for China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique) that does not benefit the United States."

    Since Dulles's speech on September 30th, Taiwan newspapers have been worried that the United States is not reliable. In this speech, Dulles openly condemned the Chiang Kai-shek clique for gathering a large number of troops in Kinmen and other places as "foolish" and blatantly hinted at the possibility of the United States abandoning Chiang Kai-shek and finding another agent. A few days ago, the "United Daily News," which is close to the Taiwan authorities, said, "We should ask the United States to frankly tell us to what extent it is prepared to support us." The "Public Opinion Daily," run by Taiwanese people, said on the 5th that Dulles's speech "at least shows the weakness of the United States. These words show that the United States is a paper tiger."

    News said that the "tense relationship" between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States is continuing to grow. Agence France-Presse's Taipei correspondent reported on the 6th that people in the Chiang Kai-shek clique "often make mutually contradictory comments, which in fact show a deep embarrassment," and their "worry about future developments is increasing."

    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Since the Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Peng Dehuai, issued a letter to compatriots in Taiwan on the 6th, it can be seen from the statements and speeches of the U.S. government leaders in the past three days that the U.S. authorities, on the one hand, expressed welcome to the actions of the Chinese government, but on the other hand, deliberately distorted the Chinese government's humanitarian measures and patriotic appeals to the Chinese military and civilians in the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu areas, confusing it with the U.S. authorities' so-called "ceasefire" request, while continuing to carry out intimidation and blackmail, threatening the Chinese people to accept its so-called "permanent ceasefire."

    U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herter, in the first official statement issued on the same day as Minister Peng Dehuai's message on the 6th, said, "(The) State Department has noted a statement broadcast by Beijing Radio, allegedly issued by the Chinese Communist Minister of National Defense. This statement... seems to be moving in the direction of a ceasefire." "Regardless of the motives of the Chinese Communists, the United States welcomes their announcement of their intention to stop shelling the coastal islands for a week and hopes that this foreshadows their permanent cessation of armed attacks." The statement also said, "The U.S. government is carefully studying this statement in close consultation with its ally, the government of the Republic of China (i.e., the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique)." State Department spokesman White further explained the intentions of the United States on the 8th, saying, "The entire purpose of the United States in the Kinmen crisis has always been to achieve a ceasefire, and obviously we hope that the current ceasefire will continue."

    At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, Vice President Nixon, and Secretary of Defense McElroy successively came forward and expressed their opinions on China's message. Dulles, upon returning to Washington on the 7th, made a statement, saying, "This is exactly what the United States has been striving to seek." He also said, "This also shows that if the Chinese Communists resume the war again, they will definitely be condemned by the whole world." Nixon also shamelessly vilified the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory of Kinmen and Matsu as "wanton aggression" in a speech on the 8th. Nixon advocated continuing to implement the so-called "firm policy" towards China and not retreating in the face of aggression against the Chinese people. On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy said in Seoul that China's suspension of shelling Kinmen was "an encouragement to peace," but he also expressed that China should "extend" the period of suspension of shelling, while also slandering China for "committing aggression" and clamoring that the United States must maintain its "deterrent force."

    It is worth noting that the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 8th, saying on the one hand that the U.S. government's order to the Seventh Fleet to "escort" the Chiang Kai-shek clique's supply of materials to Kinmen "does not need to be revised," and on the other hand, it said, "Since the Chinese Communists have stopped attacking the coastal islands and the supply work to these islands, the United States has no need to carry out escorting militarily for the time being." This is different from the Taiwan authorities' current clamor that they would rather risk continued shelling and blockade than allow the United States to withdraw its escort. However, the statement immediately followed by saying, "If the Chinese Communists resume the attack, then according to this order, the U.S. escort activities will immediately resume to the required extent." This means that the U.S. government is ready to further infringe upon China's territorial waters and airspace, interfere in China's internal affairs, and carry out military provocations at any time.

    After the U.S. State Department statement announced the temporary cessation of escorting, news dispatches from U.S. news agencies from Taipei admitted that this was only an expedient measure and did not mean any change in policy. United Press International quoted "well-informed sources" as saying that the temporary cessation of U.S. escorting did not mean the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Taiwan Strait area, and at the same time, "the overall plan for U.S. naval escorting remains unchanged." In addition, according to U.S. military authorities in Taipei on the 7th, U.S. long-range reconnaissance bombers will also continue to patrol the entire area of ​​activity of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's fleet in the Taiwan Strait.

    Another fact that people cannot ignore is that the United States continues to strengthen its military forces and aggressive deployments in Taiwan. The United States is using the tense situation it created to further intensify its overall control over Taiwan in all aspects. The United States has transferred the Second Missile Battalion of the 71st Artillery Regiment, equipped with "Nike-Hercules" missiles and atomic warheads, to Taiwan. This is the first such battalion that the United States has transferred to the Far East. The missile equipment of this battalion and more than 700 soldiers operating the missiles have arrived in Keelung on the 5th and 8th respectively. The missile launch base is being built at an accelerated pace.

    These actions of the U.S. authorities in persisting in aggression and continuing to intensify war threats and military provocations cannot but raise questions about whether the United States has the sincerity to conduct peace negotiations and resolve the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan region.

    台澎金马同胞热烈欢迎彭部长文告
    蒋介石集团和美国的紧张关系正在继续增长
    美国企图歪曲彭部长文告继续玩弄“停火”阴谋继续挑衅
    新华社9日讯　各方消息表明，我国国防部长彭德怀告台湾同胞书，受到了台、澎、金、马军民同胞们的热烈欢迎。在6日我福建前线人民解放军暂时停止对金门等地蒋军的惩罚性炮轰以后，合众国际社记者当天从金门发出的报道里说，“你不必说中国话就可以注意到这个岛上气氛缓和下来了，每个人的心情都非常愉快”。这个记者说，虽然金门蒋军当局没有公布彭德怀部长文告，但是停止炮轰的消息从蒋军“一个炮位口传到另一个炮位，并且口传到了海滩”。被迫替美国利用中国人打中国人的阴谋卖命的金门蒋军对于暂停炮轰“感到高兴”，他们的想法是：“我们至少还可以再活一星期”。
    在台湾，据法新社报道，彭德怀部长文告发表后，6日清晨在台北“引起很大轰动”。
    台湾当局连日来紧张地举行了一连串的秘密会议。蒋介石在6日当天召集陈诚、张群等高级军政人员举行紧急会议，研究这个文告。
    蒋介石6日在回答美国国家广播公司记者的问题时，说这个文告“完全是一种骗局”，并表示“不予理会”。
    台湾当局的发言人沈锜发表的谈话也说什么停止炮轰是“玩弄邪恶的和平攻势”，是“发动新攻势前的喘息”等等。照他的说法，这个“和平攻势”旨在“松弛我金门军民的士气”，“挑拨离间”台湾地区人民同美国间的“感情”。
    同时，台湾当局的发言人的谈话，和他们的报纸都特别强调美国应当采取什么态度。蒋介石强调说，“宁愿冒继续炮击封锁的危险，亦决不愿意美国盟邦退出护航”。他要求美国同台湾当局一起“继续采取坚定立场”，不要“退却”。台北的“中央日报”7日要求美国中断华沙中美会谈。这家报纸说，“再举行任何谈判就一定会成为关于美国撤出西太平洋的讨论”。在“中央日报”这样主张以前，蒋介石自己在对英国“星期日泰晤士报”记者的谈话里，已经要求过立即停止华沙会谈。
    台湾当局发言人沈锜也在呼吁“美国盟友不要误中毒计”，“在此紧要关头，必须更进一步加强（美蒋）团结”。
    美国国务院在8日公开宣布暂时停止护航的同一天，美国驻台湾的“军事援助顾问团”陆军组长博尔克在台北明白表示，美国对蒋介石军队“所采取的任何行动都是为了首先使美国受益”，“凡不能使美国受益的事情，我们就不替中国（指蒋介石集团）做”。
    在杜勒斯9月30日的谈话发表以后，台湾报纸这些天来已经一直是忧心忡忡，担心美国并不可靠。杜勒斯在这次谈话里公开斥责蒋介石集团把大量兵力集结到金门等地是“愚蠢”的，并且露骨地暗示美国抛弃蒋介石另找代理人的可能性。前几天，接近台湾当局的“联合报”说，“我们应该要求美国坦率地告诉我们，它准备支持我们到什么程度”。台湾人士办的“公论报”在5日说，杜勒斯谈话“所投下的阴影”，“至少表明美国的软弱。这些话表明美国是一个纸老虎”。
    消息说，蒋介石集团同美国间的“紧张关系”正在继续增长。法新社驻台北记者6日报道，蒋介石集团人士“常常是互相矛盾的评论，事实上表现了一种深刻的狼狈”，他们对于今后发展的“担心在与时俱增”。
    新华社9日讯　在中华人民共和国国防部长彭德怀6日发表告台湾同胞书以后，从三天来美国政府首脑人物的声明和发言中可以看出，美国当局一方面表示欢迎中国政府的行动，另一方面却故意歪曲中国政府对台、澎、金、马地区中国军民的这一人道主义的措施和爱国主义的号召，把它同美国当局的所谓“停火”要求混淆起来，同时继续进行恫吓讹诈，威胁中国人民必须接受它所谓的“永久停火”。
    美国代理国务卿赫脱在6日当天就彭德怀部长文告发表的第一个官方声明说，“（美国）国务院注意到了北京电台广播的一项据称是中国共产党国防部长发表的声明。这声明……看来是朝着停火的方向走的”。“不管中共的动机如何，美国欢迎他们宣布打算停止炮轰沿海岛屿一星期的表示，并希望这预示他们将永远停止武装进攻”。声明又说，“美国政府正在同它的盟国中华民国政府（即台湾蒋介石集团）密切磋商的情况下仔细研究这项声明。”国务院发言人怀特8日进一步说明了美国所怀抱的意图，他说，“美国在金门危机中的整个目的一直是实现停火，显然我们希望目前的停火将继续下去。”
    同时，美国国务卿杜勒斯、副总统尼克松、国防部长麦克耳罗伊相继出马，对中国的文告发表了意见。杜勒斯在7日回到华盛顿的时候发表了谈话，表示“这正是美国一直努力寻求的”。他还说，“这件事也说明，中国共产党人如果再度恢复战争，就一定会受到全世界的谴责”。尼克松也在8日发表的演说中无耻之尤地诬蔑中国人民解放自己领土金门马祖的斗争是“无端的侵略”。尼克松鼓吹要继续对中国实行所谓“坚定政策”，而不要在侵略中国人民方面后退。同一天，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在汉城发表谈话说，中国暂停炮轰金门的行动是“对和平的鼓舞”，但是他也表示要中国方面“延长”停止炮击的期限，同时还诬蔑中国“进行侵略”，叫嚷美国必须保持“威慑力量”。
    值得注意的是，美国国务院8日发表声明，一方面说美国政府向第七舰队发出的为蒋介石集团向金门输送补给物资“护航”的命令“不需要修正”，另一方面又说，“由于中国共产党停止袭击沿海岛屿和对这些岛屿的补给工作，美国在军事上暂时没有必要进行护航”。这一点是同台湾当局目前关于宁肯冒继续被炮轰封锁的危险也决不愿意美国退出护航的叫嚷是不同的。但是，声明紧接着又说，“如果中国共产党恢复袭击，那么根据这个命令，美国的护航活动将马上恢复到需要的程度。”这就是说，美国政府随时准备进一步侵犯中国领海领空、干涉中国内政、进行军事挑衅。
    在美国国务院声明宣布暂时停止护航以后，美国通讯社从台北发出的消息承认，这只是一个权宜之计，它并不意味着政策有什么改变。合众国际社引用“消息灵通人士”的话说，美国暂时停止护航并不意味着美军撤出台湾海峡地区，同时，“美国海军护航的总的计划仍然不变”。此外，据台北美国军方权威人士7日透露，美国长程侦察轰炸机也将在台湾海峡上空在蒋介石集团的船队活动的整个地区继续巡逻。
    人们所不能忽视的另一个事实是，美国继续在台湾加强军事力量和侵略部署。美国正利用它一手制造的紧张局势力图从各方面进一步加紧它对台湾的全面控制。美国已经把配备“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹和原子弹头的第七十一炮兵团第二导弹营调到台湾，这是美国调到远东来的第一个这样的营。这个营的导弹装备和七百多名操纵导弹的士兵已经先后在5日和8日到达基隆。这种导弹的发射基地正在加紧修建中。
    美国当局这种坚持侵略和继续加紧进行战争威胁和军事挑衅的行动，使人不能不对美国有无诚意来进行和平谈判，解决中美之间在台湾地区的国际争端提出疑问。
