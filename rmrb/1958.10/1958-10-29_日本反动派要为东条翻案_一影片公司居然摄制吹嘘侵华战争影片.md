    Japanese Reactionaries Attempt to Overturn the Verdict on Tojo
    A Film Company Actually Produces a Film Glorifying the War of Aggression Against China
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: Amidst the countercurrent of the Kishi Nobusuke government's intensified efforts to revive Japanese militarism, the Japanese Shintoho Film Company is vigorously producing films to overturn the verdict on the Japanese militarists' crimes of aggression in World War II.
    Shintoho Film Company has just completed a color film tentatively titled "The Greater East Asia War," openly portraying Hideki Tojo, the mastermind behind the war of aggression against China and the instigator of the Pacific War, as a "hero." The film also describes the Far East Military Tribunal, which sentenced the war criminal Tojo to death by hanging, as "illegal" and "unreasonable."
    This film openly trumpets the "ideal" of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" as being realized, describes Japan's crimes of aggression in World War II as "self-defense," and denies that Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a sneak attack.
    This company has also produced two other films glorifying the war of aggression against China and the Russo-Japanese War launched by Japan. (Attached picture)

    日本反动派要为东条翻案
    一影片公司居然摄制吹嘘侵华战争影片
    新华社28日讯　东京消息：在岸信介政府加紧进行复活日本军国主义的逆流中，日本新东宝影片公司大力摄制为日本军国主义在第二次世界大战中的侵略罪行翻案的影片。
    新东宝影片公司刚摄制完成一部暂时命名为“大东亚战争”的五彩影片，公然把侵华战争的元凶和发动太平洋战争的祸首东条英机描绘成“英雄”。这部影片并且把将战犯东条判处绞刑的远东军事法庭说成是“非法的”和“无理的”。
    这部影片公然吹嘘“大东亚共荣圈”的“理想”正在实现，把日本在第二次世界大战中的侵略罪行说成是“自卫”，并且否认日本对美国珍珠港的突然进攻是偷袭。
    这个公司另外还摄制了为日本发动的侵华战争和日俄战争吹嘘的两部影片。（附图片）
