    Jinping – A Banner for Rapid and High-Yielding Forest Production
    By our reporter Wu Zhenquan
    Jinping County is a red flag county in the national movement for rapid and high-yielding forest production. Forests cover 70% of the county's total area, and the current timber reserves amount to more than 20 million cubic meters. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the county averaged 5.7 cubic meters of timber felled per person, directly supporting the construction projects of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Sanmenxia Reservoir, and the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the county have been cultivating Chinese fir forests for more than 300 years and have accumulated rich experience. The county has been known for decades as one of the homelands of "Eighteen Fir" (meaning that fir trees mature in eighteen years), and the county seat is known as "Timber City."
    This spring, influenced by the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, Jinping County launched a new upsurge in forestry production, taking the all-people rectification campaign as the guiding principle. Subsequently, the Jinping County Party Committee proposed to launch a rapid and high-yielding Chinese fir production movement throughout the county. To this end, the County Party Committee organized a large number of cadres to travel through the deep mountains and dense forests to conduct investigations and research among the vast number of forest farmers, and discovered a large number of rapid and high-yielding Chinese fir forests. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 6,000 mu of fir trees that have matured in eight to eighteen years throughout the county. Among them, the "Eighteen Fir" in Hekou Township generally reach more than 20 meters in height, with a diameter at breast height of about 30 centimeters, and timber reserves of more than 50 cubic meters per mu. In the past, Southern Chinese fir trees generally took 30 years to mature, and Northern pine trees generally took 70 or 80 years to mature. Now, the Chinese fir trees in Jinping County only need to grow for about ten years to mature (diameter at breast height reaches 20 centimeters), which is not only a miracle in the history of Chinese fir tree growth, but also a miracle in the history of world tree growth.
    The Jinping County Party Committee made a detailed study of the technical measures taken by forest farmers of all ethnic groups to cultivate Chinese fir trees. In June, the County Party Committee issued a call to the people of all ethnic groups in the county to launch a movement to change "Eighteen Fir" to "Ten Fir," requiring the county to cultivate one million mu of rapid and high-yielding fir trees, planting more than 400 fir seedlings per mu, to mature within ten years, with timber reserves of 60 cubic meters per mu; and to cultivate 10,000 mu of high-yield fir forests, densely planting more than 600 fir seedlings per mu, to mature within ten years. This grand plan, after in-depth dissemination and discussion, has now formed a conscious movement of the people of the entire county. According to current statistics, the county has cultivated 520,000 mu of rapid and high-yielding forests. The experience of Jinping County is very valuable and has therefore received attention from forestry representatives of many provinces and regions. We believe that in the next few years, Jinping County's experience in forest production will blossom and bear fruit across the vast land of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    锦屏——林木快速丰产的旗帜
    本报记者　吴振全
    锦屏县是全国开展林木快速丰产运动的红旗县。全县森林面积占总面积的70％，现在木材积蓄量达二千多万立方公尺。在第一个五年计划期间，这个县平均每人采伐五点七立方公尺，直接支援了武汉长江大桥、三门峡水库、包兰铁路等地建设工程。
    这个县的各族人民，营造杉林已有三百多年的历史，积累了丰富的经验。这个县几十年一直被誉为“十八杉”（即杉树生长十八年成材）的家乡之一，县城被誉为“木头城”。
    今年春天，在全国工农业生产大跃进形势的影响下，锦屏县以开展全民整风为纲掀起了林业生产的新高潮，接着中共锦屏县委提出要在全县开展杉木快速丰产运动。为此，县委组织大批干部走遍深山密林，向广大林农作调查研究，发现了大批杉木快速丰产林。据初步统计，在八年至十八年内生长成材的杉树，全县有六千多亩。其中河口乡的“十八杉”一般树高达二十多公尺，胸高直径三十公分左右，每亩木材积蓄量达五十多立方公尺。过去南方杉树一般要三十年才能成材，北方松树一般要七、八十年才能成材。如今，锦屏县的杉树只要生长十年左右就能成材（胸高直径达二十公分），这不仅是中国杉树生长史上的奇迹，而且是世界树木生长史上的奇迹。
    中共锦屏县委会，对各族林农培植杉树的技术措施作了细致研究，6月间中共县委会已向全县各族人民发出开展改“十八杉”为“十杉”运动的号召，要求全县培植快速丰产杉一百万亩，每亩栽杉苗四百株以上，在十年以内生长成材，每亩木材积蓄量达六十立方公尺；并培植一万亩高额丰产杉林，每亩密植杉苗六百株以上，在十年内生长成材。这个宏伟的规划，经过深入地传达和讨论，现已形成了全县人民的自觉运动。截至目前统计，全县培育的快速丰产林已达五十二万亩。锦屏县的经验是十分宝贵的，因此得到了许多省区林业代表的重视。我们相信，今后要不了几年，锦屏县的林木丰产经验就将在祖国的大片河山上开花结果。（附图片）
