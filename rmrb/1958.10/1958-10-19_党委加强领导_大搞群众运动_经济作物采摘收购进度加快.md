Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Thanks to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels and the vigorous launch of mass movements, the harvesting and procurement of economic crops such as cotton, tobacco, and hemp across the country has begun to improve. As of October 10th, the country had procured over 7.9 million dan of ginned cotton, over 1.95 million dan of cured tobacco, and over 1.87 million dan of various types of hemp. The procurement progress of cotton and tobacco has increased compared to the same period last year, but it is still far behind this year's total output and procurement targets. The procurement progress of hemp is even lower than last year.

The procurement progress of cotton has increased relatively quickly in Henan and Hebei. In the first ten days of October, the amount of ginned cotton procured in these two provinces increased by 1.25 times and 2 times respectively compared to the entire month of September. The procurement volume in the first ten days of October in Zhejiang, Beijing, and other places also increased compared to late September. However, progress in many regions, such as Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Shandong provinces, has been relatively slow. The procurement volume of tobacco and hemp has increased rapidly in some areas, but progress is slow in most areas.

Currently, many cotton, tobacco, and hemp producing areas have launched mass harvesting and emergency harvesting campaigns. Some areas that have taken action quickly have initially reversed the phenomenon of no one picking the cotton that is spitting out fibers, and no one harvesting, baking, and stripping the ripened tobacco and hemp. At the beginning of October, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee held a telephone conference, deciding to launch a vigorous cotton picking and purchasing campaign throughout the province. After the meeting, the province organized a 5 million strong army, including the old, young, semi-able-bodied, and students, to carry out a concentrated cotton picking and selling effort. By the 10th, more than 60% of the 1.4 billion jin of seed cotton that had sprouted in the province had been picked. Under the attention and leadership of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, a 3 million strong army for cotton picking and delivery was organized, advancing at a rate of 32 million jin of seed cotton picked per day. Liaoning Province has also organized nearly 200,000 laborers to carry out a concentrated cotton picking effort, with a daily picking volume reaching 15 million jin.

On the basis of large-scale cotton picking and ensuring that every piece of cotton fiber returns home, a cotton selling upsurge, larger in scale and more concentrated in time than in previous years, is forming in various places. Adapting to the increased awareness of the masses and the maturity of technical conditions after the people's communes were established, many regions have implemented a method of procurement whereby the people's communes themselves inspect the grades, weigh the cotton, settle the accounts, and transport it themselves. The main task of commercial staff is to strengthen technical instruction and guidance. As a result, labor has been greatly saved, costs have been reduced, and procurement progress has been accelerated. In areas where this procurement method is implemented, inspection is generally accurate, weighing is error-free, and the work of separate picking, storage, drying, and selling is done very well. The quality of cotton has not only not decreased, but has even improved. In Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, the best quality second-grade cotton only accounted for 8% last year. After implementing the new method this year, second-grade cotton has increased to 38%, which can increase the income of the county's people's communes by 196,000 yuan. With the support of the masses' enthusiasm for selling cotton, the progress of cotton procurement in many counties has been extremely rapid. Xincai County in Henan Province took the lead in the country, exceeding the annual unified purchase task by 171% by the 10th. In Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui, the commissioner personally took charge, and by the end of September, more than 60% of the annual procurement plan had been completed, an increase of 13.5 times compared to the same period last year. After a mass upsurge of hemp selling was launched in many counties in Jiangxi Province, more than 50% of the hemp procurement task has been completed.

Currently, the main problems in the harvesting and procurement of cotton, tobacco, and hemp are still slow harvesting, procurement not keeping up, untimely transportation, and slow processing in some areas. These all require Party committees at all levels to continue to strengthen leadership, uniformly arrange labor, closely rely on the masses, and use the method of "large movement encompassing small movements, regular center encompassing temporary crash programs" to push the procurement work to a new climax.

### 党委加强领导　大搞群众运动  经济作物采摘收购进度加快

    党委加强领导　大搞群众运动
    经济作物采摘收购进度加快
    新华社17日讯　由于各地党委的加强领导和大搞群众运动，全国棉、烟、麻等经济作物的采摘、收购情况开始好转。截至10月10日统计，全国共已收购皮棉七百九十多万担，烤烟一百九十五万多担，各类麻一百八十七万多担。棉、烟收购进度都比去年同期有所增长，但是同今年的总产量和收购任务比较起来却还相差很远；麻类收购进度还不如去年。
    棉花收购进度增长较快的是河南、河北。这两省10月上旬收购的皮棉分别比9月份全月收购量增长一点二五倍和二倍。浙江、北京等地10月上旬的收购量比9月下旬也有上升。但有不少地区如山西、陕西、山东等省进展比较迟缓。烟麻的收购量是部分地区增长较快，大部地区进展缓慢。
    现在许多棉、烟、麻产区已经展开了群众性的采摘、抢收运动，部分行动较快的地区初步扭转了棉花吐絮无人采摘，烟、麻成熟无人采摘、烘烤和剥制的现象。河北省人民委员会在10月初召开电话会议，决定在全省开展一个轰轰烈烈的采棉收棉运动。会后全省组织了包括老幼半劳力和学生等在内的五百万人大军，突击摘棉售棉，到10日，全省吐絮的十四亿斤籽棉已采摘了60％以上。河南省在省委的重视和领导下，组织了三百多万人的棉花采摘、交售大军，以日摘籽棉三千二百万斤的速度前进。辽宁省也组织了近二十万劳动力进行突击摘棉，日摘量达到一千五百万斤。
    在棉花大量采摘并做到朵絮还家的基础上，一个比往年数量更大、时间更加集中的售棉热潮正在各地形成。适应人民公社化以后广大群众觉悟提高和技术条件的成熟，不少地区在收购方法上实行了由人民公社自行验级、自行过秤、自行结算、自行运交的方法，商业工作人员的主要任务是加强技术传授和指导。这样作的结果，大大节约了劳动力，降低了费用，而且加快了收购进度。实行这种收购办法的地区，一般都能做到检验准确、秤无差错，而且分摘、分存、分晒、分售的工作也做得很好，棉花品级不仅没有降低，而且有所提高。辽宁省盖平县去年质量最好的二级棉只占8％，今年实行新办法后，二级棉提高到占38％，可以为全县人民公社增加收入十九万六千元。在群众这种售棉热情支持下，许多县的棉花收购进度极为迅速。河南省新蔡县在全国一马当先，到10日就超额完成了全年统购任务171％。安徽阜阳专区由专员亲自挂帅，到9月底已完成全年收购计划60％以上，比去年同期增长了十三倍半。江西省不少县掀起群众性售麻高潮后，麻类收购任务已完成50％以上。
    当前，棉、烟、麻的采摘收购中的主要问题仍然是采摘迟缓，收购跟不上，运输不及时，有些地区加工也赶不上。这些都需要各地党委继续加强领导，统一安排劳动力，紧密依靠群众，用大运动套小运动、经常中心套临时突击的办法，把收购工作推向新的高潮。
