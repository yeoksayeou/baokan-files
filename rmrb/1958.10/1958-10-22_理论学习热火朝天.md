Theoretical Study is in Full Swing

Yangquan Mining Bureau Fourth Mine Ventilation Workshop Party Branch Secretary Niè Tiězhù

Before the housing adjustment, the Fourth Mine Ventilation Workshop, etc., had 194 employees, residing in Taolinggou, Cai'ao, Shibuju, Xiaoyangquan, and other places. Due to the scattered residences, it was inconvenient to conduct political and ideological education for employees in their spare time. Some workers lived more than ten miles away from the mine, wasting valuable time on commuting; those living in collective dormitories, after work, either watched operas, strolled the streets, or played mahjong and cards, having nothing to do. Since the mine unified housing adjustments in February this year, the employees of the ventilation workshop have moved to the Duanjiabei dormitory from all directions, not only solving the problem of dormitories being far from the mine but also creating favorable conditions for employees to engage in regular entertainment and study in their spare time. Therefore, according to the general requirements of the employees, we organized all the workshop employees to study theory and compiled the employees with lower education levels into six study groups, letting those with higher education levels regularly read newspapers and magazines such as Red Flag and Forward for them. After the workers' theoretical study was launched, their ideological awareness has been greatly improved. Through study and debate, 130 employees clarified the relationship between national and personal interests and examined their selfish and self-interested thoughts, the phenomena of absenteeism and absence have decreased. The workers generally feel that they have gained a lot from studying theory, and many people actively subscribe to newspapers and periodicals. The number of newspapers and magazines subscribed to by the entire workshop has quickly increased from the original 28 to 207, with an average of more than one copy per person. (Attached picture)

After adjusting their dormitories, they set aside a portion of their bonuses to set up a library. After work, they gather together to study.　Photo by Liáng Yì (Draft from Shanxi Daily)

    理论学习热火朝天
    阳泉矿务局第四矿通风车间支部书记　聂铁柱
    调整住房以前，四矿通风车间等有职工一百九十四人，分别住宿在桃林沟、蔡凹、石卜咀、小阳泉等地，由于住地分散，在业余时间对职工进行政治思想教育有许多不便。有的工人住处离矿十多里路，把一些宝贵的时间都耽误在上下班的道路上了；住在集体宿舍的职工下了班，不是看戏、逛大街就是打麻将、玩扑克，没有事干。自从今年2月矿上统一调整了住房，通风车间的职工们从四面八方都搬在段家贝宿舍里住，不仅解决了宿舍离矿远的困难，而且也为职工们在业余时间进行正规的娱乐和学习创造了有利条件。于是根据职工们普遍要求，组织起全车间职工学理论，并且把文化程度较低的职工编成了六个学习小组，让文化程度较高的经常给他们读报纸和红旗、前进等杂志。工人们理论学习开展起来以后，思想觉悟都有很大提高，通过学习辩论，有一百三十名职工明确了国家利益和个人利益的关系，检查了自己自私自利的思想，旷工、缺勤等现象。工人学了理论，普遍感到收获很大，不少人积极订阅报刊，全车间订的报刊、杂志由原来的二十八份，很快就增加到二百零七份，平均每人有一份还多。（附图片）
