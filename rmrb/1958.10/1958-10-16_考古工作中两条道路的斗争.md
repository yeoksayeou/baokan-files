The struggle between two lines is acute in archeology. It is our urgent task to criticize the bourgeois line and clarify the socialist line.

In the past three decades, archeology based on investigation and excavation began to appear in China through the introduction of bourgeois scholars who studied in Europe and the United States. However, in the years before liberation, it was almost entirely dependent on the "funding" of imperialists, and therefore, could only do very little work.

At that time, Marxist historians in our country had already realized the role of physical materials in historical research, and thus regarded archeology as an important component of historical science. A review of the situation in the historical circles in the 1920s and 1930s will illustrate the problem. Marxists have tried their best to use archeological data in their historical works, and they have also made outstanding achievements in archeological research. This is a model for our archeological workers today.

While archeological technology was introduced from capitalist countries, it also brought in bourgeois academic thoughts. Archeology during the reactionary ruling period was deeply influenced by the reactionary thoughts of Hu Shih and Fu Sinian; imperialists and cultural relics compradors left behind many toxins in archeology. Since liberation, after several ideological remolding and academic criticism movements, the archeological community has made considerable progress in political understanding. However, these movements have not really touched the bourgeois academic strongholds in archeology. Therefore, these strongholds are still stubbornly resisting. If ancient history in historical science is the stronghold where the bourgeoisie is stubbornly resisting, then archeology is one of the most stubborn corners. Just examining the academic journals and monographs in archeology in recent years, one can find the serious bourgeois academic thoughts and styles that exist in them.

Their first argument is that archeology has nothing to do with politics. Politics is a matter for the Communists, and the Communists are political talents who do not understand archeology. Not only do they think that archeology has nothing to do with politics, but they also think that they themselves have nothing to do with politics. They are mostly indifferent to good and bad things at home and abroad, and only see pottery jars and antiques as higher than everything else. In their view, it seems that any important and urgent basic construction should be subject to slow archeological excavation, as for how important the site is and what role it plays in social history research, it can be left unaccounted for! "Important treasures, please do not disturb the earth," the current people should unconditionally take care of the dead, as if it is their only principle. They indulge in objects and lose their ambition, appreciating themselves in solitude. This kind of obsession with antiques is like being addicted to opium. What is revolution and reaction, what is socialism and imperialism? They often cannot distinguish clearly. They are even more indistinguishable between enemies and ourselves in academics, and often measure our archeological work according to the so-called academic standards of imperialism. Once praised by imperialist scholars, they feel that their reputation has increased tenfold, and they are complacent. Some individuals even degenerate to the point of recognizing the thief as their father. There was such an archeologist who, after the vigorous national anti-rightist struggle, actually took out the scene photos of him following the Japanese invading army to steal cultural relics in our country in an attempt to insert them into the text for publication. In the eyes of this kind of person, as long as they can occupy a little archeological material, the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race is nothing to be afraid of.

Their second argument is that archeology can do without theory and without Marxism. Some people say: "Archeology studies matter, it is inherently materialistic." Some say: "Archeology is a science with strong technicality." Their research work is desperately drilling into fragmented small problems, wholeheartedly looking for a star and a half of so-called new discoveries. They believe that "small problems cannot be studied clearly, large problems cannot be started, and fundamental problems must start from trivial problems." In fact, small problems cannot be studied completely, and can only become more and more, making research work forever trapped in tedious situations. When they write articles, they often list a large amount of data, quoting scriptures and classics to show off their erudition, but in fact they cannot grasp the key issues, and of course they cannot put forward issues worth discussing, let alone solve problems. Some even do not know what problem they want to explain.

They believe that solving any small problem, as long as there is evidence, has equal value, or even higher value, to solving a fundamental theoretical problem. "Discovering a word is equivalent to discovering a star"; they regard their so-called discovery as an irrefutable eternal conclusion. This is full of Hu Shih's poison of "talk more about problems, less about isms." They value materials and despise theory, believing that new materials produce new articles, new articles produce new talents, and treasures can make articles immortal. They take mastering materials or material knowledge as erudition. Under the control of this thought, field work aims to hunt for rare and exotic objects, while turning a blind eye to the large number of phenomena that reflect social life and production. "Seeing the tip of an autumn hair but not seeing a cartload of firewood." They panic in the face of a large amount of data, and the reports they write are tedious, fully demonstrating the bewildered state of losing their souls. An archeologist said "I only introduce materials, I don't make inferences," to show his so-called scientific attitude. This is of course a replica of Hu Shih's "say one point for one point of material" and Fu Sinian's "produce one point of goods for one point of material." In 1954, Hu Shih's thought was criticized beyond recognition, but its poison is still corroding their archeological work.

Their third argument is that archeology is a profound and unpredictable knowledge that cannot be understood by ordinary people. Therefore, the articles they write strive to be obscure, writing easy-to-understand truths in a mysterious way, just to prevent people from understanding. They regard themselves as experts, thinking that they are insiders, and try their best to make themselves idols of superstition, so that archeological workers can be obsessed with them. They themselves believe in Europe and the United States, thinking that archeology can only be done in the UK and the US, not in China. The vast number of archeological workers are unreliable, let alone outsiders. Therefore, they are only willing to work alone and do not want to cooperate. They hold infinite concerns about popularizing knowledge, fearing that once it is popularized, things will be ruined. The so-called ruined things are nothing more than destroying their so-called "specifications." These "specifications" are precisely the outdated rules and regulations formulated under the guidance of bourgeois academic thoughts that hinder academic development.

We believe that science itself is not the purpose, and "science for science's sake" is an extremely wrong view. Archeology has never been and cannot be separated from politics. It serves different political purposes in different countries. In capitalist countries, it has served the colonialism of the bourgeoisie. Reactionary bourgeois archeologists try to use archeology to create various fallacies to oppose Marxism, using "cultural dissemination theory" and vulgar evolutionism to find theoretical basis for imperialist racial discrimination and external expansion, and to justify imperialist military aggression. In short, they create some so-called theories to serve the reactionary politics of capitalism. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the academic tyrants on the one hand tried their best to promote that archeology has nothing to do with politics, and on the other hand monopolized the data to attack Marxist historical research. Under the guise of "archeology for archeology," they embellished the then reactionary rule and paralyzed the people's revolutionary fighting spirit. Fu Sinian and his ilk long occupied the archeological position in our country, using pseudo-science to serve the reactionary politics of the Kuomintang. In socialist today, archeology must serve the socialist cultural construction, to prosper the motherland's historical research, and to enrich Marxist historical materialism. Without this political purpose, there can be no bright future.

If archeology is to fulfill the task of serving the people and serving socialist construction, it must work under the guidance of Marxist ideology. As a historical science, archeology, field excavation and the publication of archeological data are of course indispensable steps, but it must not stop only at field investigation and excavation work, nor can it stop at simply describing the data, publishing the data, and researching the age, use, name and manufacturing method of the data. These should be the preparatory stage for research work, and we must further explain the social features at that time according to the specific materials, and then study the laws of historical development. It is impossible to complete such a task without Marxism as a guiding ideology. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "People were able to make a comprehensive historical understanding of the development of social history and turn their understanding of society into science only when the modern proletariat appeared with the huge productive forces—the large industry, which is the science of Marxism." ("On Practice"), Lenin once clearly pointed out the two main shortcomings of all historical theories before Marx: "First, all previous historical theories, at most, only examined the ideological motives of people's historical activities, but did not examine what caused these motives, did not grasp the objective laws in the development of the social relations system, and did not recognize the level of material production development as the root of this relationship; second, the previous theories happened not to include the actions of the masses of the people, and only historical materialism enabled us for the first time to examine the social conditions of mass life and the changes in these conditions with a natural historical precision. The "sociology" and history before Marx, at most, collected some fragmentary and stiff facts and described individual aspects of the historical process." As a science, archeology cannot be without theory. There are indeed some technical tasks in archeology, but more important is theory, and the establishment of a theoretical system of Chinese archeology guided by Marxism. The bourgeoisie dare not face up to the laws of historical development, because the development of history is destined for the demise of the bourgeoisie itself. Therefore, bourgeois scholars try their best to guide historical research to the textual research of trivial issues that are irrelevant to the essence. The same is true in archeology. Denying the importance of theory is the only way they resist Marxism when they are increasingly declining.

We advocate putting politics in command, clarifying the political purpose of archeological work, and vigorously carrying out comprehensive research guided by Marxist ideology. Field work and writing reports should have clear academic purpose. Different academic opinions should implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and gradually distinguish right from wrong in the debate. We believe that we must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois academic thoughts in archeology, and criticize the current bourgeois academic direction and style in our work. Only by carrying out a resolute struggle against bourgeois academic thoughts and eliminating their toxins, can Marxism be promoted in the archeology of our country, and our comprehensive research work can be carried out in the correct direction; only in this way can our archeological work have a clear purpose and a clear political direction. Some people believe that the bourgeois academic direction has been criticized, and they are very unfamiliar with the comprehensive research work guided by Marxism; "the old methods are wrong, and the new methods have not yet been learned, so they are worried and extremely troubled. In fact, this is completely unnecessary. As long as we take a positive attitude, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, and infiltrate the basic spirit and basic principles of Marxism into specific research work, and use the Marxist position, viewpoint, and method to transform our research work, it will generate great courage, eliminate our bourgeois academic thoughts and styles; break superstitions, liberate our minds, and we will see a broad prospect.

We believe that if we want to change our academic style, we cannot do it behind closed doors. We must follow the mass line, put out the true state of our academic thoughts in the masses, and sincerely conduct joint research and joint criticism with comrades in order to solve the problem. Any forgiveness and defense of the bourgeois academic thoughts that exist in oneself will become an obstacle to self-revolution.

Since liberation, thanks to the attention and support of the Party and the government, archeological work has achieved unprecedented development, the archeological team has grown, and a large number of extremely valuable historical and cultural relics data have been discovered. For the past six months, the people of the whole country have been drumming up full enthusiasm and carrying out a great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and at the same time, it will inevitably promote the archeological workers of the whole country to adapt to this situation, and a new atmosphere will appear in archeological work. This fully shows that our archeological cause has entered an era of great promise; however, due to the vicious influence of bourgeois academic thoughts, the so-called archeologists are facing such a gratifying situation and have generated endless worries; facing such a rich and large number of material historical materials, they are at a loss and do not know what to do, but they are stockpiled in warehouses in batches. Is this strange phenomenon of "begging for food with a golden bowl" not serious? Is it not clear that the leaping situation in archeological work cannot appear without pulling out the white flag and inserting the red flag in archeological work? Archeological workers should break all worries, thoroughly criticize bourgeois academic thoughts, eliminate their vicious influence, so that our archeological work will have a new style, so as to do our archeological work well under the situation of the national great leap forward.

    考古工作中两条道路的斗争
    尹达
    在考古学中存在着尖锐的两条路线的斗争。批判资产阶级路线，明确社会主义路线，是我们的迫切任务。
    我国在近三十年来，通过留学英美的资产阶级学者的介绍，以调查发掘为基础的考古学开始出现，但在解放以前的许多年，它差不多完全是依靠帝国主义者的“资助”，因之，也只能作很少的工作。
    当时，我国的马克思主义的历史学家就已经认识到实物资料在历史研究中的作用，从而把考古学看作历史科学的一个重要的组成部分。只要回顾一下二三十年以来历史学界的情况，就可以说明问题了。马克思主义者曾经在自己的历史著作中尽量地利用了考古资料，而且他们在考古研究中也作出了优异的成绩。这是我们今天考古工作者的榜样。
    考古技术从资本主义国家介绍来的同时，也带来了资产阶级的学术思想。反动统治时期的考古学受到胡适、傅斯年的反动思想的影响很深；帝国主义分子和文物买办在考古学中遗留下许多毒素。解放以来经过几次思想改造和学术批判运动，考古学界在政治认识上是有相当提高的，但是，在这几次运动中，并没有真正触及考古学中资产阶级的学术堡垒，因此，这些堡垒到现在还在负隅顽抗。如果说历史科学中的古代史是资产阶级负隅顽抗的据点，那么考古学就是其中最顽固的一个角落。只要把考古学方面几年来的学术刊物和专著检视一下，就可以发现其中所存在的严重的资产阶级学术思想和学术作风。
    他们的第一个论调是，考古和政治无关。政治是共产党人的事，而共产党是政治人材，不懂得考古。他们不但认为考古学和政治无关，而且认为他们的自身也与政治无关。他们对于国内外的好事和坏事，大都无动于衷，只见陶罐、古物高于一切。在他们看来，似乎任何重要而紧迫的基本建设都应该服从于慢吞吞的考古发掘，至于那里的遗址怎样重要，对于社会历史的研究起什么作用，却可以不作应有的交代！“宝物重地，请勿动土，”现在的人应该无条件的照顾死人，仿佛就是他们唯一原则。他们玩物丧志，孤芳自赏，这种迷恋古物的神情，像上了鸦片烟瘾。什么是革命与反动，什么是社会主义和帝国主义？他们往往分辨不清。他们在学术上更是敌我不分，经常按照帝国主义的所谓学术标准来衡量我们的考古工作。一经帝国主义学者的称赞，他们就感到声价十倍，沾沾自喜。个别人甚至堕落到认贼作父的地步。有这么一位考古学家，在轰轰烈烈的全国反右派斗争之后，竟拿出他追随日本侵华军人在我国盗掘古物的现场照片企图插在文字里发表。在这种人看来，只要能占有一点考古材料，亡国灭种是在所不顾的。
    他们的第二个论调是，考古学可以不要理论，不要马克思主义。有人说：“考古学研究的是物质，他本来就是唯物的”。有的说：“考古学是一门技术性较强的科学”。他们的研究工作是拼命的钻向支离破碎的小问题，一心一意去找一星半点的所谓新发现。他们认为“小问题不研究清楚，大问题就无从着手，根本问题须从枝叶问题开始”。实际上，小问题是研究不完的，只能愈来愈多，使研究工作永远陷入烦琐不堪的境地。他们写起文章来，往往罗列大量资料，引经据典，以炫耀其博学，实则既抓不住关键问题，当然也就提不出值得讨论的问题，更谈不到解决问题了。有的甚至连要说明什么问题自己也不甚了然。
    他们认为解决任何一个小问题，只要有证据，和解决一个带有根本性的理论问题有相等的价值，或者有更高的价值。“发现一个字就等于发现一颗恒星”；把自己的一点所谓发现看作颠扑不破的千古定论。这里充满胡适的“多谈些问题，少谈些主义”的毒素。他们重材料轻理论，认为新材料出新文章，新文章出新人才，宝物可以使文章不朽。他们以掌握资料或资料性的知识为博学。在这种思想支配之下，田野工作志在猎取珍奇异物，对于反映社会生活和生产面貌的大量现象却视而不见。“明察秋毫之末而不见舆薪”。他们在大量资料面前慌了手脚，编写的报告烦琐不堪，充分表现出丧失灵魂的迷惘状态。有一位考古学家说“我只介绍材料，不作推论”，用以表示自己的所谓科学态度。这当然是胡适“有一分材料说一分话”、傅斯年的“有一分材料出一分货”的翻版。1954年胡适思想已被批判得体无完肤，但它的毒素却仍然在腐蚀着他们的考古工作。
    他们的第三个论调是：考古学是一门高深莫测的学问，非一般人所能理解。因此他们所写的文章，力求艰涩，把容易懂得的道理写得很神秘，无非是不让人懂。他们以专家自居，自以为内行，极力使自己成为迷信的偶像，好让考古工作者迷恋他们。他们自己却迷信欧美，认为考古学也只有英美行，中国不行。广大考古工作者是不可靠的，更不用说外行了。因此，就只肯单干，不想合作。对于推广知识，却抱着无穷的顾虑，怕的是一经推广，就会坏事。所谓坏事，不过是破坏了他们的所谓“规格”而已。这种“规格”，正是在资产阶级学术思想指导下制定出来的、一些阻碍学术发展的清规戒律。
    我们认为科学本身不是目的，“为科学而科学”是一种极其错误的观点。考古学从来没有而且也不可能脱离政治，它在不同的国家为不同的政治目的服务。在资本主义国家，它曾为资产阶级的殖民主义服务。反动的资产阶级考古学家力图通过考古学制造各种谬论来反对马克思主义，用“文化传播论”和庸俗进化论为帝国主义种族歧视、向外扩张找寻理论根据，为帝国主义的军事侵略张目。总之，他们制造一些所谓学说为资本主义的反动政治服务。在国民党反动统治下，学阀一方面极力宣扬考古与政治无关，一方面却垄断资料，用以攻击马克思主义的历史研究，他们在“为考古而考古”的幌子下，为当时的反动统治粉饰太平，麻痹人民的革命斗志。傅斯年之流曾长期占据我国考古学阵地，用伪科学为国民党的反动政治服务。在社会主义的今天，考古学必须为社会主义的文化建设服务，为繁荣祖国的历史研究、丰富马克思主义的历史唯物主义服务。失去了这个政治目的性，就不可能有光明的前途。
    考古学要完成为人民服务、为社会主义建设服务的任务，就必须在马克思主义思想指导之下进行工作。考古学作为一门历史科学，田野发掘以及考古资料的公布，固然是不可缺少的步骤，但是，绝不能仅仅停留在田野调查和发掘工作上，也不能停留在仅仅描述资料、公布资料以及考证资料的年代、用途、名称和制法等等。这些应当是研究工作的准备阶段，必须更进一步根据具体的材料去阐明当时社会面貌，进而研究历史发展的规律。要完成这样的任务，没有马克思主义作为指导思想是不可能的。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“人们能够对于社会历史的发展作全面的历史的了解，把对于社会的认识变成了科学，这只是到了伴随巨大生产力——大工业而出现近代无产阶级的时候，这就是马克思主义的科学。”（实践论），列宁曾经明确指出马克思以前一切历史理论底两个主要缺点：“第一，先前一切历史理论，至多不过考察了人们历史活动的思想动机，却没有考察这些动机究竟是由什么所引起的，没有捉摸到社会关系体系发展中的客观规律性，没有认定物质生产发展程度是这种关系的根源；第二，先前的理论，恰巧没有包括到人民群众的行动，只有历史唯物主义才第一次使我们能用自然历史精确眼光考察群众生活底社会条件，以及这些条件的变更。马克思以前的‘社会学’和历史学，至多不过搜集了一些片断的生硬事实描写了历史过程底个别方面”。考古学作为一门科学，就不可能没有理论。在考古学中固然有某些技术性的工作，但是，更重要的却是理论，却是以马克思主义为指导思想的中国考古学的理论体系的建立。资产阶级不敢正视历史的发展规律，因为历史的发展注定了资产阶级自身的灭亡，于是资产阶级学者极力引导历史研究走向无关本质的细微末节的问题的考证上去，在考古学方面也正是如此。否定理论的重要性正是他们在日趋没落时对抗马克思主义的唯一手法。
    我们主张政治挂帅，明确考古工作的政治目的性，大力开展以马克思主义为指导思想的综合研究。田野工作和编写报告等工作都应该有明确的学术目的性。学术上的不同意见应该贯彻百家争鸣的方针，在争论中逐渐辨明是非。我们认为，必须彻底批判考古学中的资产阶级的学术思想，批判当前工作中的资产阶级学术方向和作风。只有同资产阶级的学术思想进行坚决的斗争，清除其毒素，马克思主义在我国考古学中才能得到发扬，我们的综合研究工作才能够在正确的方向下开展起来；只有这样，才能使我们的考古工作有明确的目的性，有明确的政治方向。有人认为资产阶级学术方向批判了，以马克思主义为指导思想的综合研究工作，自己又十分生疏；“旧的作法错了新的作法还没有学会，因此忧虑多端，烦恼异常。其实，这是完全不必要的，只要采取积极的态度，认真学习马克思列宁主义，把马克思主义的基本精神、基本原理渗透到具体研究工作中去，运用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去改造自己的研究工作，就会产生极大的勇气，清除自己的资产阶级学术思想和作风；破除迷信，解放思想，就会看到广阔的前景。
    我们认为，要想改变自己的学术作风，关起门来，是办不到的，必须走群众路线，在群众中把自己的学术思想的真实状况摆出来，诚心诚意的和同志们共同研究，共同批判，才能够解决问题。对自己所存在的资产阶级学术思想的任何原谅和辩解，都会成为自我革命的障碍。
    解放以来，由于党和政府的重视和支持，考古工作得到了空前的发展，考古学的队伍壮大了，且发现了大量的极其宝贵的历史文物资料。半年以来，全国人民正鼓起十足的干劲，开展工业和农业的大跃进，同时也必然要推动全国的考古工作者适应着这一形势，在考古工作中出现一种新的气象。这充分说明我国的考古事业已进入了大有可为的时代；但是由于资产阶级学术思想的恶毒影响，所谓考古学家面向着这样可喜的局面，竟然产生了无穷的忧虑；面对着这样丰富的大量物质史料，竟手足无措不知如何是好，却使它们一批批的积压到仓库里去。这种“端着金碗要饭吃”的怪现象，难道还不严重吗？不拔掉考古工作中的白旗，不插上红旗，在考古工作中就不可能出现跃进的形势，难道还不清楚吗？考古工作者应当打破一切顾虑，彻底批判资产阶级的学术思想，清除其恶毒的影响，使我们的考古工作出现一个新的作风，以便在全国大跃进的形势下，作好我们的考古工作。
