Keep This on File
    The "Martyr" Did Not "Achieve Virtue"
    The Chiang Plane Truly Crashed and Broke to Pieces
    Lies Cannot Conceal Ugliness
    Self-Deception Cannot Deceive Others
    Zhang Naijun, a second lieutenant pilot of the 27th Squadron of the Fifth Wing of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force who was captured, has eliminated the fear caused by the rumors spread by senior Chiang Kai-shek military officers that "being captured by the Communist army means being beheaded and buried alive" under the influence of our policy of leniency towards prisoners, and is living a peaceful life.
    This "martyr," who was portrayed by Taiwan newspapers as having "died heroically" while rescuing the lead plane, was captured by militiamen such as Chen Jinhua of the Haikou People's Commune, who had already realized universal conscription, when his plane crashed and he parachuted to the ground. That day was October 10th, when a total of six F-86 American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes intruded into the mainland off the coast of Fujian, but three of them were shot down by our air force as soon as they invaded. Of the planes shot down, two crashed near Longtian, and one crashed into the sea.

    “烈士”并未“成仁”
    蒋机确已粉身
    撒谎难掩丑态
    自欺焉能欺人
    被俘的蒋军空军第五大队二十七中队少尉飞行员张乃军在我宽待俘虏政策的感召下，已经消除了由于蒋军高级军官散布“当共军俘虏、要被砍头活埋”的谣言所产生的恐惧心理，过着平安的生活。
    这个被台湾报纸描绘成为因援救长机而“壮烈成仁”的“烈士”是在飞机坠落跳伞着陆时被业已实现全民皆兵的海口人民公社的民兵陈金华等俘获的。那天正是10月10日，当时共有六架F—86型美制蒋机窜扰我福建沿海大陆，可是刚刚侵入便被我空军击落三架。被击落的飞机，有两架坠毁于龙田附近，一架坠入海中。
