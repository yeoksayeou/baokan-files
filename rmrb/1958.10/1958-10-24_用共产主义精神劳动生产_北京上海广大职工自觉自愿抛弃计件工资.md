Xinhua News Agency report: Based on the conscious and voluntary actions of the working masses, many enterprises in Beijing have recently abolished piece-rate wages. The workers say that they are now engaged in socialist construction with a Communist spirit. Piece-rate wages are not in line with the Communist spirit. Therefore, they have requested the abolition of this wage system.

As early as a year ago, some workers had criticized the piece-rate wage system. During the rectification campaign, workers launched extensive airing of views, big debates, and big character posters under the topic of "For Whom Do We Work?" Whether piece-rate wages had any superiority became one of the prominent issues in this debate.

Those who were superstitious about piece-rate wages being able to promote the development of productivity believed that piece-rate wages could best stimulate workers' enthusiasm for production and were a driving force for promoting production. Therefore, it was the best form of labor remuneration in socialist state-owned enterprises.

However, the vast majority of workers cited a large number of facts, exposing a series of negative factors that emerged after the implementation of piece-rate wages: First, under the "stimulation" of piece-rate wages, many workers were picky about their work, neglecting quality. During each revision of quotas, some workers often stood in opposition to the factory, haggling over every detail. A few workers even resorted to deception, over-reporting finished products, and fraudulently claiming wages. Second, piece-rate wages also created artificial contradictions between new and old workers, and between workers on time-based wages and workers on piece-rate wages. Old skilled workers were generally assigned to do jobs with complex products, with high requirements and time-consuming work. Young workers, due to their lack of technical skills of advanced workers, could only be assigned to specialize in one or two kinds of work. Practice makes perfect, and they produced more. Calculated on a piece-rate basis, young workers often received more wages than old skilled workers. Third, units implementing piece-rate wages had extremely cumbersome work-hour quotas and reporting systems. The Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had more than 16,000 work-hour quotas, and the Second Machine Tool Factory's monthly reports weighed as much as 41 kilograms. This not only required a whole set of institutions and personnel to serve this purpose but also made the workshop directors trapped in matters related to piece-rate wages all day long and unable to extricate themselves. Fourth, and more importantly, in these economic units, only money was seen, not politics, which led workers' thinking to individualism. Some workers who received wages on a piece-rate basis even asked, "Do we get paid for attending meetings and cleaning?" Through these facts, workers criticized themselves for not treating their country with an employer-employee attitude. At the same time, they suggested that leaders should improve their awareness through political and ideological education and should not one-sidedly use material incentives to replace workers' consciousness. The workers said heroically: During the several revolutionary wars, there was no piece-rate wage system. Revolutionary cadres and people spared no blood and sacrificed themselves to work selflessly for the people's cause. After liberation, a low-wage system was implemented. Without the stimulus of the piece-rate wage system, the working class, under the leadership of the Party, quickly restored production. In today's great leap forward in socialist construction, when the consciousness of the working masses has been greatly improved, is it still necessary to rely on pure material incentives?

While exposing the various malpractices of piece-rate wages, the workers actively requested the leadership to immediately abolish this wage system. Before the leadership had approved it, the workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration stopped filling out the "work tickets" used as the basis for piece-rate calculations. More workers in enterprises returned the excess earnings from piece-rate wages. After the leadership approved their request, the workers immediately launched a new upsurge in production. At present, among the 58 large-scale state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the city that implemented piece-rate wages, 51 units have approved or are approving the workers' requests to stop implementing piece-rate wages. Employees of the remaining seven state-owned enterprises and construction, commercial, and joint state-private enterprises are also making such requests to the leadership. However, units for which it is appropriate to implement piece-rate wages, such as household sideline production and other industries, will not be changed for the time being.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: In the great leap forward in production, Shanghai workers resolutely demanded the abolition of the piece-rate wage system that hinders the leap forward, criticizing the implementation of this system as "putting money in command," not putting politics in command. As of the beginning of October, workers in more than 40 large and medium-sized heavy industrial factories in the city, such as machinery manufacturing, steel, and shipbuilding, had mostly abolished piece-rate wages. More than 100,000 workers in the textile and light industries also demanded the freezing or abolition of piece-rate wages.

According to statistics at the end of last year, there were approximately 250,000 industrial workers in Shanghai who implemented the piece-rate wage system, of which 200,000 were piece-rate wage systems inherited from capitalist enterprises (mainly in the textile and light industries, most of which have been reformed to some extent after liberation). Less than 50,000 people have implemented piece-rate wages only after liberation, generally accounting for only 20%-30% of the total number of employees in the factory. The drawbacks of the piece-rate wage system were exposed as early as March and April of this year when workers in various factories aired their views on unreasonable rules and regulations, and they became even more obvious since the great leap forward in production. In many factories, with the production tasks increasing many times over and the technical revolution surging, the tasks of time-based workers also increased, and their wages remained the same, while the wage income of piece-rate workers rose linearly, and their actual income generally exceeded their basic wage by 30%-40%, and the high ones exceeded it by more than double. After the rectification and double-anti movements, the workers' consciousness improved. They felt that everyone was making a leap forward, and it was disgraceful to have too much personal income. They said one after another, "The great leap forward has put money into our own pockets, what is it called a great leap forward!" Workers at the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory said: "Implementing piece-rate wages is equivalent to buying workers' enthusiasm with money. This underestimates the consciousness of our workers too much." Because the workers' consciousness has improved, many factories have workers refusing to receive overtime wages or overtime pay after working overtime, and taking voluntary labor as an honor. It was in this situation that the workers in various factories resolutely demanded the abolition of the piece-rate wage system.

A large number of facts in recent months have proved that in all cases where the piece-rate wage system has been abolished on the basis of mass consciousness and replaced with a time-based wage, the workers are more cheerful, internal unity has been strengthened, production has leap-forwarded faster, and the Communist spirit has been greatly promoted. Relevant departments investigated 43 factories in the Yangpu District, the most concentrated area of factories in Hudong, and not a single factory experienced a decline in production after the abolition of piece-rate wages. The Diesel Engine Factory has seen its output increase month by month since the abolition of the piece-rate wage system in June. In the Diesel Engine Workshop of the Qiuxin Shipyard, the output in September increased by 35% compared with August. The forging workshop of the Jiangnan Shipyard completed more than 10,000 more work hours in September than in August. In the past, when assigning tasks, people often picked and chose the easy ones. Now, it has become extremely common for workers to arrive at work early, leave late, participate in voluntary labor on rest days, and strive to create wealth for socialism every minute and every second.

### 用共产主义精神劳动生产  北京上海广大职工自觉自愿抛弃计件工资

    用共产主义精神劳动生产
    北京上海广大职工自觉自愿抛弃计件工资
    据新华社讯　在工人群众自觉自愿的基础上，北京市不少企业最近取消了计件工资。工人们说，他们现在是以共产主义的精神从事社会主义的建设。计件工资不符合共产主义精神。因此他们要求取消这种工资制。
    早在一年以前，有些工人对计件工资制就提出过批评。在整风运动中，工人们在“为谁劳动”这个议题下，展开了大鸣大放大争大辩。计件工资到底有无优越性成为这次争辩中的突出问题之一。
    迷信计件工资能促进生产力发展的人们认为：计件工资最能刺激工人的生产积极性，是推动生产发展的动力，因而它是社会主义国营企业中的劳动报酬的最好的形式。
    但是，绝大部分工人举出大量事实，揭发了实行计件工资以后所产生的一系列的消极因素：第一，在计件工资的“刺激”下，许多工人干活时挑肥拣瘦，忽视质量。在每次修改定额时，有些工人往往和工厂站在对立的地位，锱铢必较地讨价还价。少数工人甚至弄虚作假，多计成品，冒领工资。第二，计件工资也使新老工人之间、拿计时工资的工人和拿计件工资的工人之间，产生了人为的矛盾。老技工一般都被分配做产品复杂的活，要求高，费时多，青年工人由于没有高级工的技术水平，只能分配他们专做一两种活，熟能生巧，出活就多，按计件工资计算，青年工人往往因此比老技工得到更多的工资。第三，实行计件工资的单位，有着极其繁琐的工时定额和表报制度，长辛店机车车辆修理厂有一万六千多种工时定额，第二机床厂每个月的表报重达四十一斤，它不仅需有一整套为此服务的机构和人员，并且使工长整天陷在有关计件工资的事务中而不能自拔。第四，更重要的是在这些经济单位中，只见钱，不见政治，把工人的思想引向个人主义。有些按计件工资领取工资的工人甚至问：“开会搞卫生给不给钱？”通过这些事实，工人们批评自己不应该以雇佣态度对待自己的国家，同时也建议领导上应该通过政治思想教育来提高他们的觉悟，不要片面地用物质刺激的办法来代替工人的自觉。工人们豪迈地说：在几次革命战争时期没有任何计件工资制，革命的干部和人民不惜流血牺牲忘我地为人民的事业努力工作；解放以后实行低工资制，没有计件工资制的刺激，工人阶级在党的领导下迅速地使生产得到恢复；在工人群众觉悟大大提高和在社会主义建设大跃进的今天，难道还必须依靠单纯的物质刺激吗？
    工人们在揭发计件工资各种流弊的同时，积极要求领导上立即取消这种工资制。在领导上还未批准的时候，北京铁路管理局丰台机务段的工人即停止填写作为计件依据的“作业小票”；更多企业的工人则纷纷退回计件工资超额所得部分。而在领导上批准他们的要求以后，工人们又立即掀起了一个新的生产高潮。现在，全市实行计件工资的五十八个国营和地方国营的大型工矿企业，已有五十一个单位批准和正在批准工人们提出的停止执行计件工资的请求，其余七个国营企业和建筑、商业、公私合营企业等单位的职工，也正在向领导上提出这种要求。但是对于有些工种、行业如家庭副业生产等以实行计件工资为宜的单位则暂时仍不改变。
    据新华社上海电　上海工人在生产大跃进中，坚决要求取消妨碍跃进的计件工资制度，批评实行这个制度是“钞票挂帅”，不是政治挂帅。截至10月上旬止，全市的机械制造、钢铁、造船等四十多个大中型的重工业厂的工人，已绝大部分取消了计件工资；纺织、轻工业中也有十多万工人要求冻结或取消计件工资。
    据去年年底的统计，上海市实行计件工资制的产业工人约有二十五万人，其中有二十万人是由资本主义企业遗留下来的计件工资制（主要是纺织工业和轻工业，其中大部分在解放后已作了若干改革）。解放后才实行计件工资的还不到五万人，一般也只占厂内职工总人数的20％—30％。计件工资制的弊端，早在今年3、4月间，各厂工人对不合理的规章制度进行鸣放时，就开始揭露，生产大跃进以来，暴露得更加明显。很多厂在生产任务成倍增加、技术革命风起云涌的情况下，计时工人的任务同样增加，工资仍按原数，而计件工人的工资收入直线上升，实际收入普遍超过基本工资的30％—40％，高的超过一倍以上。经过整风和双反运动，工人觉悟提高了，他们感到大家同样跃进，个人收入过多是不光彩的，纷纷说：“大跃进把钞票都装进了自己袋袋里，还叫什么大跃进！”上海电机厂工人说：“实行计件工资等于拿钞票买工人的积极性，这是把我们工人的觉悟估计得太低了。”由于工人觉悟提高，好多厂都有工人在加班加点之后拒绝领取超额工资或加班费，以义务劳动为光荣。各厂工人就是在这样情况下，坚决要求取消计件工资制的。
    近几个月来的大量事实证明，凡是在群众自觉的基础上取消了计件工资制，改为计时工资以后，工人们心情舒畅，内部团结加强了，生产跃进更快了，共产主义精神大大发扬。有关部门调查了沪东工厂最集中的杨浦区的四十三个厂，在取消计件工资以后，没有一个厂生产下降。柴油机厂从6月份取消计件工资制到现在，产量月月上升。求新造船厂的柴油机车间，9月份的产量比8月份上升35％，江南造船厂锻工车间9月份比8月多做一万多工时，过去分配任务常常有人挑肥拣瘦，现在，工人们早上班、迟下班，休息日参加义务劳动，争取一分一秒的时间为社会主义创造财富成为极平常的现象了。
