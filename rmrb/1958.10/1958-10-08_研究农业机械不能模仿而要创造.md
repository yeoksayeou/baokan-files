Title: Research on Agricultural Machinery Should Emphasize Creation, Not Imitation

    After the bumper harvest in agriculture, two issues have been raised regarding agricultural mechanization. One is that due to the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the increased labor input, it is necessary to accelerate mechanization. The other is that old-style agricultural machinery equipment cannot meet the needs of today's agricultural development, and new tools need to be created.
    Currently, due to the rapid development of industrial production, there are conditions for mass-producing agricultural machinery. The question is, what kind of machinery should we manufacture? For example, what kind of tractors are needed, mainly high-horsepower or low-horsepower? This is a major issue that needs to be considered. In the past, we envisioned promoting small, versatile tractors, but if small tractors cannot solve the problem of deep plowing in the context of the universal demand for deep plowing in agricultural bumper harvests, this may not be the case. Some people used to think that China only needed to improve foreign tractors. Now it seems that the more important thing is to create our own tractors or other power sources according to our special requirements. If electric plows can be used, many places may not need tractors.
    The situation with farm tools is even more so. In the past, there was a lot of dogmatism on this issue. For example, on the issue of deep plowing, foreign literature rarely exceeds 25 to 30 centimeters, and deep plowing tools rarely go beyond the scope of plows. The design principle of plows can be said to be derived only from a geometric point of view. Now that we need to deep plow, loosen the soil, and solve the problems of excessive resistance and deep fertilization, it makes people feel that we must break with convention and create our own.
    Currently, the most important thing is to create some new tools, especially deep plowing machinery, which needs to be created quickly. The agricultural mechanics we have seen in the past are mainly written based on foreign farming experience, and now it is clear that we need to create our own theory based on China's own farming experience. In the past, we believed that to catch up with the world level in agricultural machinery science, we only needed to learn from foreign countries and master foreign technology. Now it seems that the main thing should be to learn from the experience of domestic farmers. As long as we can summarize our own experience, we will inevitably be able to reach and exceed the world level. Such a path has never been clearer than it is now. Foreign combine harvesters can only harvest up to 600 jin of wheat per mu, while some of our high-yield fields have yields of several thousand jin or tens of thousands of jin per mu. Our harvesters not only need to be changed in individual mechanisms, but also need to be created in the principles applied to harvesting. We used to think that agricultural machinery was relatively far from cutting-edge science, but now it seems that many problems may need to be solved by making good use of cutting-edge science.

    研究农业机械不能模仿而要创造
    陶鼎来
    农业丰产以后，对农业机械化提出了两个问题。一个是由于农业生产的大跃进，劳动量的加大，需要加速实行机械化。一个是旧样式的农业机械装备，不能适应今天农业发展的需要，需要创制新工具。
    目前，由于工业生产大发展，有条件大量制造农业机械。问题在于我们应该制造什么样的机械？例如，要什么样的拖拉机，是以大马力的为主，还是以小马力的为主？这就是当前需要考虑的一个大问题。过去，我们曾设想要推广小型万能拖拉机，这在农业丰产普遍要求深耕的情况下，如果小型拖拉机不能解决深耕问题就不一定如此了。有些人过去认为，我国只要把外国拖拉机加以改进就行了。现在看来，更主要的应当是根据我们的特殊要求，来创造我们自己的拖拉机或其它动力。如果能用电犁，许多地方就可以不要拖拉机。
    农具方面的情况更是如此。过去在这个问题上，教条主义很多。例如深耕的问题，国外文献很少有超过二十五到三十公分的，深耕工具很少超过犁的范围。犁的设计原理，可以说仅是从几何学的观点推算出来的。现在我们既要深耕，又要松土，还要解决阻力过大和深层施肥等问题。这就使人感到必须打破陈规，自己去创造。
    目前最重要的是要创造一些新的工具，特别是深耕机械，需要赶快创制。我们过去所看到的农业机械学，主要是根据国外的耕作经验写的，现在显然需要根据中国自己的耕作经验，创造一套我们自己的理论。过去我们认为，要在农业机械科学方面赶上世界水平，只有向外国学习，掌握外国的技术。现在看来，主要的应当是向国内农民的经验学习。只要我们能够总结自己的经验，就必然可以达到和超过世界水平。这样的一条道路，没有比现在更明显的了。国外的谷物联合收割机，最多只能收割亩产六百斤的麦子，而我们一些丰产田的亩产量却是几千斤，几万斤，我们的收割机就不仅在个别机构上要有所改变，在收割所应用的原理上，也必须有所创造。我们过去认为，农业机械距离尖端科学比较远，现在看来，有许多问题可能需要好好利用尖端科学才能解决。
