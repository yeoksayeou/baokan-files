    Rapidly and Fundamentally Harnessing the Yellow River
    Construction Begins on the Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia Key Water Conservancy Projects
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou – To fundamentally control the Yellow River's flood damage and develop its water resources, the Liujiaxia and Yanguoxia key water conservancy projects simultaneously commenced construction ahead of schedule on the 27th of last month. After these two major projects are completed, not only will the Northwest region and Gansu Province receive a powerful supply of electricity, but the Yellow River, which has long threatened the safety of the people along its banks, will also be used extensively to irrigate farmland.
    Liujiaxia is located eighty kilometers southwest of Lanzhou. This water conservancy project was designed independently by Chinese engineering and technical personnel under the guidance of Soviet experts; all hydropower equipment will also be manufactured domestically. The total installed capacity of the power station is 1.05 million kilowatts, and it can generate 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually after completion.
    Yanguoxia is located near the downstream of Liujiaxia. The installed capacity of the Yanguoxia water conservancy project is 595,000 kilowatts, and the reservoir capacity is more than 200 million cubic meters. From surveying and design to formal construction, the power station only took four months.
    Both major water conservancy projects will implement the principles of "local methods first, diversified approaches, a combination of local and foreign methods, and gradual mechanization" during construction. Currently, in the case of insufficient machinery, more than 6,000 employees on the construction site are taking semi-mechanical methods for construction. They are determined to complete the two major water conservancy projects at the fastest speed. (Attached picture)
    Construction of the Liujiaxia water conservancy project has begun.
    This project is extremely magnificent. Its dam is 146 meters high. The main dam and secondary dam are 993 meters long; the total reservoir capacity is 5.7 billion cubic meters.

    快速根治黄河
    刘家峡、盐锅峡两大水利枢纽工程开工
    新华社兰州电　为根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利而建设的刘家峡和盐锅峡两大水利枢纽工程，在上月27日同时提前开工。这两大工程建成后，不但西北地区和甘肃境内将得到强大的电力供应，而且一直威胁沿岸人民安全的黄河水，也将被大量利用来灌溉农田。
    刘家峡位于兰州市西南八十公里。这个水利枢纽工程是在苏联专家指导下，由我国工程技术人员自行设计的；全部水力发电设备也将由国内制造。电站装机总容量为一百零五万瓩，建成后每年可以发电五十亿度。
    盐锅峡在刘家峡下游附近。盐锅峡水利枢纽装机容量为五十九万五千瓩，水库容量为两亿多公方。电站从勘测设计到正式施工，前后只用了四个月。
    这两大水利枢纽工程在施工中都将贯彻“土法先上马、方法多样化、土洋相结合、逐步机械化”的方针。目前，在机械不足的情况下，工地上的六千多名职工正在采取半机械的方法进行施工。他们决心用最快的速度建成两大水利枢纽工程。（附图片）
    刘家峡水利枢纽工程动工了。
    这一工程极其宏伟。它的拦河大坝高达一百四十六公尺。主坝与副坝共长九百九十三公尺；水库总容量为五十七亿立方公尺。
