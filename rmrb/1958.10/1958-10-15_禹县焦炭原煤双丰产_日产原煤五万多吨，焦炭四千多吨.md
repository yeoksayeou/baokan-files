Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th: The 50,000-strong coal army in Yuxian County, Henan Province, after working day and night, launched double "satellites" on the 12th, producing 56,760 tons of raw coal and 4,236 tons of coke daily. Coke production surpassed Linru, and raw coal production surpassed Baofeng, taking the first place in the province. The daily output of raw coal increased by 20.8 times compared to the average daily output in early October; coke production increased by 18.1 times compared to the average daily output in early October.

The launch of this "satellite" in Yuxian vividly illustrates that as long as we are under the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses, and give full play to the wisdom and strength of the people, we can create miracles.

In terms of methodology, Yuxian promoted "five grasps and five simultaneous actions." The five grasps are grasping political mobilization, grasping ideological education, grasping labor organization, grasping small-scale indigenous groups, and grasping transportation. The five simultaneous actions are simultaneous coal mining, simultaneous coke production, simultaneous transportation, simultaneous production, and simultaneous warehousing. The county also implemented a system of three fixings, three guarantees, and one breakthrough: first, fixing leaders to be responsible for mines and small teams; second, fixing time to guarantee timely completion; third, fixing tasks to guarantee both quality and quantity; in order to break through the coal production barrier.

    禹县焦炭原煤双丰产
    日产原煤五万多吨，焦炭四千多吨
    据新华社郑州14日电　河南省禹县五万煤炭大军经过昼夜苦战，在12日放出了日产原煤五万六千七百六十吨、日产焦炭四千二百三十六吨的双“卫星”。焦炭超过了临汝，原煤超过了宝丰，跃居全省第一位。这天产的原煤比10月上旬平均日产量增长二十点八倍；焦炭产量比10月上旬平均日产量增长十八点一倍。
    禹县这次“卫星”上天，生动地说明了只要在党的领导下，充分发动群众，把人民群众的智慧和力量发挥出来，就可以创造奇迹。
    在运动的方法上，禹县推行了“五抓与五边”。五抓即抓政治鼓动，抓思想教育，抓劳动组织，抓小土群，抓运输。五边即边采煤，边炼焦，边运输，边生产，边入库。全县还实行了三定三包一突破：一为定领导，包矿井和小班；二为定时间，包按时完成；三为定任务，包质包量；以便突破煤炭生产这一关。
