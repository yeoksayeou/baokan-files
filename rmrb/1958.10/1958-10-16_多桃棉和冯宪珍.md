Multiflora Cotton and Feng Xianzhen

In late September, I came to Linzhang County, the southernmost part of Hebei Province, and visited the multiflora cotton cultivated by Feng Xianzhen, a 50-year-old farmer in the Hongguang People's Commune of this county. This kind of cotton is not only rare in China, but also very precious in the world.

When Feng Xianzhen and several other comrades led me into the cotton field, I saw many cotton bolls growing together like twin lotus flowers. These cotton bolls generally grow in twos, threes, or fours, and some even have ten or more cotton bolls growing together. Each cotton plant generally has thirty or forty cotton bolls, and some have as many as two hundred. This year, the commune planted more than 38 mu of multiflora cotton, with an average yield of 2,000 jin of high-grade seed cotton per mu.

Multiflora cotton not only has a high yield, but also good quality. According to the local processing plant's inspection, its lint is finer and longer than other cotton lint. Ordinary cotton lint is 1 and 1/16 inches long, while multiflora cotton lint is as long as 1 and 1/8 to 1 and 3/16 inches. According to the actual investigation and identification of farmer Feng Xianzhen over the past three years, and the results of planting this year in the Qinsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Xitian Town, Laizhou County, Shandong Province; the Dongxing Second Cooperative in Sanyu District, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province; the Xiawu Production Team of the Wuyi People's Commune in Lutai, Ninghe County, Hebei Province; and the Dashi Gezhuang Production Team of the Shangzhuang People's Commune in Xushui County, the seeds have not changed at all, on the contrary, the cotton bolls have become even more numerous than before!

Farmer Feng Xianzhen told me: This multiflora cotton was not easy to obtain! He remembers that in 1942, while tending cotton in the field, he suddenly discovered a double-boll cotton plant, with sixty cotton bolls growing in pairs on ten fruit branches.

In August 1954, Feng Xianzhen suddenly discovered another plant in another cotton field, with eighteen cotton bolls all being double bolls. From then on, he paid close attention to cultivating this double-boll cotton plant. In the spring of 1955, he planted more than twenty double-boll cotton seeds. These eighteen cotton plants developed even better than the one he had discovered in 1954, turning into three bolls growing together, and the double-boll cotton became multiflora cotton. During picking, these eighteen plants yielded a total of two jin and fourteen liang of cotton. In the spring of 1957, the commune allocated him 1.2 mu of land and asked him to specially cultivate this multiflora cotton. After his careful management, the multiflora cotton, which used to have only two or three cotton bolls growing in a cluster, now has four, five, or even a dozen cotton bolls growing together.

    多桃棉和冯宪珍
    9月下旬，我来到河北省最南部的临漳县，在这县的红光人民公社参观了五十岁的老农冯宪珍培植起来的多桃棉。这种棉种不仅在中国少，在世界上也是非常珍奇的。
    当冯宪珍还有其他几个同志领着我走进棉田时，我看到许多棉铃像并蒂莲一样地生长在一起。这些棉铃一般的是两个、三个到四个，多者竟有十来个棉铃生长在一起的。每株棉一般的都长有三、四十个棉铃，多者竟达二百余。今年社里种的三十八亩多桃棉，平均每亩可收高级籽棉二千斤。
    多桃棉不仅产量高，质量还很好，据当地加工厂的检验，它的绒比其他的棉绒细而长，一般的棉绒长一又十六分之一吋，多桃棉绒长达一又八分之一至一又十六分之三吋。根据老农冯宪珍这三年的实际考察鉴定和今年山东省掖县西田镇勤生农业社、江苏省南通县三余区东星二社、河北宁河县芦台五一人民公社下坞生产队、徐水县商庄人民公社大史各庄生产队各地种植的结果，籽种一点也没变样，相反的棉铃比过去越发的增多了！
    老农冯宪珍告诉我：这个多桃棉得来的可不容易啦！他记得1942年在地里修整棉花，忽然发现了一棵双桃棉，十个果枝上结着六十个棉桃都是双双的。
    1954年的8月间，冯宪珍突然又在另一块棉田里发现了一棵，十八个棉铃都是双桃。从此，他便十分注意培育这棵双桃棉，到1955年春天，点种上二十多棵双桃棉籽，这十八棵棉花较1954年刚发现的那棵有了更好的发展，变成了三个并蒂在一块，双桃棉变成了多桃棉。摘花时，这十八棵共摘了棉花二斤十四两。1957年春天，社里拨给他一亩二分地，叫他专门培植这种多桃棉花。经过他细心经管，过去一簇只长两个、三个棉铃的多桃棉，现在一簇竟有四、五个到十几个棉铃并蒂结在一起了。
