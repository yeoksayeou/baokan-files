Comprehensive report from our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency dispatches, over six thousand people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, held a grand rally on the 10th amidst swirling snow to celebrate the official opening of two bridges and three highways built with Chinese assistance. The celebration rally was held on the newly built overpass.

Damdinjav, head of the Mongolian government delegation and Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, spoke at the celebration rally, expressing his gratitude to the Chinese people for their tremendous assistance to Mongolia's socialist construction. He said that the completion of this bridge more than a year ahead of schedule fully demonstrated the drive of the Chinese comrades.

Xie Fusheng, head of the Chinese government delegation and Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, said at the celebration rally that the formal handover of the bridges and highways built with Chinese assistance in accordance with the Sino-Mongolian government agreement is a new fruit of friendship between the two peoples. He said that the Mongolian people support China's socialist construction and fully support the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan, which fully demonstrates the profound friendship of the Mongolian people for the Chinese people.

After the ribbon-cutting, Mongolian Party and government leaders such as Tsende, Dugersuren, and Baljinyam, who participated in the celebration rally, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Mongolia, visited the bridge. Subsequently, dozens of vehicles of all sizes passed over the snow-covered overpass. At this time, a train was also arriving under the bridge, heading towards Beijing.

Today, the Presidium of the Mongolian Great People's Hural awarded medals and orders to advanced Chinese workers who built the bridges and highways. In the evening, Molomjamts, Vice Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, also held a grand reception.

On the 9th, the Chinese delegation accompanied the Mongolian delegation to inspect and accept the above-mentioned construction projects. The quality of the project meets the design standards.

The reinforced concrete overpass is 370 meters long and spans the railway line from Beijing to Moscow via Ulaanbaatar. The bridge also spans a highway. Now, trains and cars can pass under the bridge, and cars and pedestrians can travel freely on the bridge. The Mongolian people call this overpass the "Peace Bridge".

Another highway bridge spans the Tuul River and is an important transportation route from Ulaanbaatar to eastern Mongolia.

The three suburban highways are more than sixteen kilometers long in total, all with asphalt pavement.

The above-mentioned construction projects were carried out with China's gratuitous assistance to Mongolia in accordance with the 1956 Sino-Mongolian agreement on China's provision of economic and technical assistance to Mongolia.

    乌兰巴托举行集会庆祝正式通车
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：蒙古首都乌兰巴托市各界人民六千多人10日下午在白雪纷飞中举行大会，庆祝由中国帮助建成的两座桥梁和三条公路正式通车。庆祝大会是在新建的跨线桥上举行的。
    蒙古政府代表团团长、邮电运输部长达姆京扎布在庆祝大会上讲话，他对中国人民对蒙古的社会主义建设的巨大援助表示感谢。他说，这座桥梁提前一年多完工，充分说明了中国同志们的干劲。
    中国政府代表团团长、中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生在庆祝大会上讲话说，根据中蒙两国政府协定由中国帮助建成的桥梁和公路今天正式接交，这是两国人民友谊的新果实。他说，蒙古人民支援中国社会主义建设，全力支持中国人民反对帝国主义的侵略和解放台湾的斗争，这充分表明了蒙古人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。
    剪彩以后，参加庆祝大会的蒙古党政负责人曾德、杜格苏伦、巴尔吉尼雅姆等以及各国驻蒙古的外交使节参观了大桥。随后几十辆大小汽车从铺着白雪的跨线桥上通过。这时，一列火车也正来到桥下，向北京方向驶去。
    今天，蒙古大人民呼拉尔主席团授给了修建桥梁、公路的中国先进职工以勋章和奖章。晚间，蒙古部长会议副主席莫洛姆扎木茨还举行了盛大的招待会。
    9日，中国代表团陪同蒙古代表团对上述建设工程项目进行了验收。工程质量合乎设计标准。
    用钢筋混凝土建成的跨线桥的桥身长三百七十多公尺，大桥横跨在由北京经乌兰巴托去莫斯科的铁路线上。大桥还横跨一条公路。现在，桥下可以通行火车、汽车，桥上的汽车和行人可以畅行。蒙古人民把这座跨线桥叫做“和平桥”。
    另一座公路桥横跨在杜拉河上，是乌兰巴托通往蒙古东部的交通要道。
    三条市郊公路共长十六公里多，都是柏油路面。
    以上这些建设工程是根据1956年中蒙两国签订的关于中国给予蒙古经济和技术援助协定无偿地帮助蒙古修建的。
