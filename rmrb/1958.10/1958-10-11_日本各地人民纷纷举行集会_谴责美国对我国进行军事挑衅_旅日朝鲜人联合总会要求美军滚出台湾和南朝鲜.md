Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: People in various parts of Japan have held rallies, demanding that the American aggressor troops withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area and that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policy of hostility towards China. These rallies are part of the two-month "Movement Month for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations, Opposing American War Provocations in the Taiwan Strait Area, and Promoting the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations," which began in early September.

    By October 4th, rallies had been held in Hokkaido, Osaka, Ibaraki, Aichi, and Gunma prefectures. Rallies were also held in six cities: Shiogama, Takasaki, Kyoto, Shimonoseki, Otaru, and Hakodate.

    The rallies held in prefectures and cities unanimously passed resolutions demanding that the United States cease its military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and immediately withdraw from the Taiwan area. The resolutions also demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policy of hostility towards China. In Nara, Mie, Shiga, Fukuoka, and other places, hundreds of rallies and informal discussion meetings were also held at the regional and group levels. In Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nagasaki and other big cities, celebrations and receptions were held on the Chinese National Day and the eve of the National Day. In Nagano, Ishikawa, Hiroshima, Miyagi, Fukuoka, and other places, preparations are being actively made to hold gatherings of the same nature.

    These rallies were mostly jointly prepared by the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan Trade Union Local Council, farmers' associations, local assembly members' leagues, local branches of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, the Japan Socialist Party, and the Japanese Communist Party.

    During the Movement Month, many famous figures went to various cities and rural areas to hold many lectures. These people included: Kenzo Nakajima, Director-General of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association; Tadataka Sata, Director of the International Department of the Socialist Party, who recently returned from a visit to China; the famous dancer Tokubei Hanayagi; Kanzo Uchiyama, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association; Vice Director-General Michio Iwamura; and the famous military commentator Katsuya Hayashi, and others.

    From August 15th to September 14th, the Youth Department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association went to the streets five times to collect signatures for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Despite the police's best efforts to obstruct them, they finally collected more than 10,000 signatures and 15,000 yen in donations.

    From May to the end of September, a total of thirty-three prefectural and municipal local assemblies in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Shizuoka, and other places passed resolutions demanding that the Japanese government break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan issued a statement on September 30th, condemning U.S. imperialism for carrying out heinous war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, demanding that U.S. aggressor troops immediately get out of Taiwan and South Korea, and expressing its determination to fight more resolutely for the peaceful reunification of the motherland together with the Chinese people who are struggling for the liberation of Taiwan.

    The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism is occupying Taiwan, the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, interfering in China's internal affairs, and plotting a heinous atomic war.

    The statement said that today, U.S. imperialism is occupying the southern half of Korea and has set up missiles there. They are also plotting new war conspiracies against the Chinese people, seriously threatening the security of the people of Korea and China and world peace.

    The statement pointed out that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is a sacred and inviolable right, and U.S. imperialism must stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The statement demanded that the American aggressors immediately stop their provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait and get out of Taiwan immediately.

    The statement also demanded that U.S. aggressor troops immediately withdraw from South Korea. The statement said that the Korean people, who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, stand with the Chinese people at all times in the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

    The statement said that an attack on the Chinese people is an attack on the Korean people. We will strengthen the flesh-and-blood unity between the peoples of Korea and China, strengthen ties with peace-loving people all over the world, and further expand the struggle to get U.S. imperialism to withdraw from the Taiwan Strait and get out of South Korea.
