Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th. The industrially backward Fuyang Special District of Anhui Province has laid the foundation for the district's machinery industry by adopting the method of self-reliance and hard work for three months. Before May, this special district could only produce some waterwheels and sluice gates. Now it has manufactured large gantry planers, milling machines, four to eight-foot lathes, and various agricultural machines, and is trial-producing tractors and automobiles. Before May, the entire district had only four iron factories, eighty-eight iron cooperatives, and iron groups. Now it has developed into twenty-two special district and county machinery factories, one thousand and eighty-two district and township repair stations, and more than two thousand agricultural cooperative repair groups.

Since the Great Leap Forward in industry, the Fuyang Special District has held high the red flag of the General Line, striving to produce lathes to equip its own machinery industry and gradually produce agricultural machines to supply agricultural needs. Originally, the entire special district did not have a single gantry planer used to process lathe parts. Seven workers from the Bo County Machinery Factory worked hard for fourteen days and first made a twelve-foot automatic gantry planer by hand and with small lathes, greatly liberating people's thinking. The machinery factories in the other nine counties also followed suit and produced gantry planers of various sizes, laying the foundation for mass production of lathes. In the process of producing lathes, they used old machines as blueprints because they didn't have any. When the technical force was insufficient, they concentrated the old workers and sent them to other places to study and visit. The blacksmiths in various districts and townships of Jieshou County even brought their own raw materials to the county machinery factory to learn lathe-making techniques. They participated in the entire process of the factory's lathe manufacturing. When the lathes were made, they had also learned the skills and went back to teach others. The steel materials for manufacturing machine tools were also made by utilizing scrap copper and iron contributed by the people of the entire district. From May to now, the ten counties in the entire special district have self-made 378 various lathes and 1,578 simple lathes.

Because the entire special district vigorously produces lathes and universally uses lathes, production efficiency has been greatly improved, the fatigue of manual production has been reduced, and the quality of products has also been improved. The workers said, "Small lathe, four feet long, iron or wood, it's all the same, it can cut, can shave, can plane, and can drill holes and grind. As long as we have it, the mechanization of agriculture and industry has a way." These lathes have produced 800,000 sets of bearings and a large number of agricultural machines. At present, various machinery factories are organizing all employees to support the launch of the iron and steel industry and produce mechanical equipment for 4.25 cubic meter open hearth furnaces.

In order to establish a relatively independent local machinery industry within one or two years, the Fuyang Special District is currently focusing on two major measures: one is to develop the iron and steel industry. The entire district is establishing two iron and steel production bases centered on Fuyang and Fengtai counties based on the distribution of mineral resources. At the same time, according to the production characteristics of the machinery industry in each county, a major division of labor and collaboration is implemented. For example, Jieshou and Fuyang counties produce good bearings, so these two counties are used as bearing production bases; Bo County manufactures high-quality lathes, so it specializes in producing various lathes; and Woyang and Mengcheng counties specialize in producing power equipment.

### 阜阳专区自力更生白手起家  自制车床　自造机械  全区已有二十多个机械工厂、一千多个修配站

    阜阳专区自力更生白手起家
    自制车床　自造机械
    全区已有二十多个机械工厂、一千多个修配站
    新华社合肥15日电　工业落后的安徽阜阳专区，采用自力更生苦战三月的办法，为全区机械工业打下基础。这个专区在5月份以前只能生产部分水车、启闭机，现在已经制造出来大型龙门刨床、铣床、四——八尺车床和各种农业机械，并且正在试制拖拉机和汽车。5月份以前，全区只有四个铁工厂，八十八个铁业社和铁业组，现在已经发展到有二十二个专区和县的机械厂、一千零八十二个区乡修配站，二千多个农业社修配组。
    自工业大跃进以来，阜阳专区就高举总路线红旗，力争生产车床，装备自己的机械工业，并逐步地生产农业机器供应农业需要。原来全专区没有一部用来加工车床部件的龙门刨床，亳县机械厂七个工人苦战十四天，首先用手工和小车床制出了一丈二尺的自动龙门刨床，大大解放了人们的思想。其他九个县的机械厂也都跟着造出了各种尺寸的龙门刨床，为大批生产车床打下基础。在生产车床的过程中，没有图样，他们就用旧机器作图样。技术力量不足，他们就把老工人集中起来到外地学习参观。界首县各区乡的铁工还自带原料到县机械厂学制车床技术，他们参加这个工厂制造车床的全部过程，车床造好，本领也学好了，再回去教给别人。制造机床的钢铁材料，也是利用全区人民献出来的破铜烂铁。从5月到现在，全专区十个县自制了各种车床三百七十八台，简易车床一千五百七十八台。
    由于全专区大力生产车床，普遍使用车床，就大大提高了生产效率，减轻了手工生产的劳累，产品的质量也有提高。工人们说：“小车床，四尺长，铁制木制都一样，能切能削能刨光，又能钻眼和磨光。只要有了它，工农业机械化有办法。”这些车床已经生产了八十万套轴承和大批的农业机器。目前各个机械厂正组织全体职工为了支援钢铁工业上马，生产四点二五立方公尺平炉的机械设备。
    为了在一两年内建立起比较独立的地方机械工业，阜阳专区最近正大抓两个措施：一个是发展钢铁工业。全区根据矿产资源分布的情况，正以阜阳、凤台两个县为中心建立两个钢铁生产基地。同时，根据各县机械工业生产的特点，实行大分工大协作。如界首、阜阳两县生产的轴承好，便以这两个县作为轴承生产基地，亳县制造的车床质量高，就专门生产各种车床；涡阳、蒙城两个县则专门生产动力设备。
