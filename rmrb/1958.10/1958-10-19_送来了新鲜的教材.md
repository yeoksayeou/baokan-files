    Fresh Teaching Materials Arrive
    Some time ago, when our third-year junior high school literature class was studying the thesis "Strive to Achieve 1,000 Jin Per Mu of Wheat Within One or Two Years," written by Comrade Shen Hanmin, First Secretary of the Gucheng County Party Committee in Hubei Province, we adopted the method of group discussion, with teachers and students studying and analyzing simultaneously. At this time, we happened to read the news published in the People's Daily on October 8th about Gucheng County striving to achieve 3,000 jin per mu of wheat next year. This news brought us fresh materials in a timely manner. After hearing this news, the students were all elated and expressed their determination to intensify their studies, actively participate in work-study programs, and contribute their youth and strength to the great socialist construction of the motherland!

    送来了新鲜的教材
    前些日子我们初中三年级文学课学到湖北省谷城县委第一书记沈汉民同志写的“争取一两年内小麦亩产千斤”的论文，我们采用了小组集体讨论的方法，师生同时进行学习和分析，这时恰好读到人民日报10月8日发表的谷城县力争明年全县亩产小麦三千斤的新闻。这篇新闻及时地给我们带来了新鲜的材料。同学们听到这个新闻后，个个欢欣鼓舞，都表示要加紧学习，积极参加勤工俭学的劳动，为祖国伟大社会主义建设，贡献自己的青春和力量！
