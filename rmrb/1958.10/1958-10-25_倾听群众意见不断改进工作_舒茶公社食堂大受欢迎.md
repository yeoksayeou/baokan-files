Listening to the Masses and Continuously Improving Work
Shucha Commune's Canteens Are Very Popular

(Reported by this newspaper) The Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, has adopted various measures to strengthen the leadership of public canteens. All canteens in the commune are well-run and welcomed by the commune members.

The Shucha People's Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to run the public canteens well, successively convened Party and Youth League member meetings, commune cadre meetings, activist meetings, and commune member meetings. It also universally mobilized the masses to debate the issue of running canteens, laying an ideological foundation for running the canteens well among all commune members. Then, it established 316 canteens. Generally, a production team runs a public canteen, or several production teams jointly run a public canteen, based on the living conditions of the masses. In some places where commune members are too scattered, the canteens are divided into several points in each small village, providing great convenience to the commune members.

In order to run the public canteens well, the Shucha People's Commune established a set of organizations to manage the canteens. The commune committee decided that a deputy director should be specifically responsible for directing the canteen work and other supply work. Each production brigade has a life brigade leader, who is generally concurrently held by the production brigade leader. Each canteen has established a management committee with five to seven members, absorbing commune members who can promptly reflect the opinions of the commune members, are good at managing the household diligently and frugally, are selfless, and canteen managers and commune and team leaders. These members include women, the elderly, and young people; this can fully reflect the opinions of all parties.

In terms of canteen management system, food management, meeting, and inspection systems have been established. Food is uniformly allocated and managed by the commune according to standards, and directly distributed to the canteens in batches and months. The canteen management committee holds four meetings a month to study how to improve the canteen work. Each canteen constantly solicits the opinions of the masses to improve its work. For example, some canteens initially made the rice very hard, and some elderly commune members had opinions, so the canteen made a few pots of soft rice specifically for them. For the convenience of mothers and children, many canteens also specifically purchased several pots. If there are mothers or children in the household, they can use the public pots to take the rice back and heat it up to eat.

In terms of the supply of non-staple foods, according to the principle of self-reliance, it tries to meet the needs of the commune members as much as possible. Each canteen grows its own vegetables, makes tofu, and raises pigs. The commune allocates an average of two to three cents of land per person to each canteen to grow vegetables, and each canteen assigns one to three people to specialize in growing vegetables and raising pigs. Other people in the canteen also help grow vegetables in their spare time. Now, each canteen has raised twenty or thirty pigs and planted dozens of acres of vegetable gardens. Generally, each person can eat one kilogram of fresh vegetables every day, and half a kilogram of pork every one to two weeks.

The Shucha People's Commune attaches great importance to canteen hygiene. Each canteen has organized a hygiene team of three to five people, stipulating that they clean three times a day. Now, the kitchen utensils and food in each canteen are very clean.

Since women have been freed from household chores and invested in collective production, the average daily labor force participating in production in this commune has increased by five to six thousand compared to before the establishment of the canteens. Many women have also participated in iron smelting and other industrial production.

The public canteens of the Shucha People's Commune have been welcomed and praised by the masses due to their continuous improvement of work by listening to the opinions of the masses. Chen Li, a woman from the Satellite Brigade, said: "The canteen is really good, the children cry less, the mothers are less anxious, no need to cook, just take a bowl and eat. In the past, I had to take care of both the fields and the house, and I was worried about both ends; now we are specialized, everyone is an expert, everyone is for me, and I am for everyone."

### 倾听群众意见不断改进工作  舒茶公社食堂大受欢迎

    倾听群众意见不断改进工作
    舒茶公社食堂大受欢迎
    本报讯　安徽省舒城县舒茶人民公社采取各种措施加强公共食堂的领导，全社食堂都办得很好，受到社员们的欢迎。
    中共舒茶人民公社委员会为了办好公共食堂，曾先后召开了党团员会议、公社干部会议、积极分子会议、社员大会，并普遍发动群众辩论办食堂的问题，在全体社员中奠定了办好食堂的思想基础，然后办起了三百一十六个食堂。一般都是根据群众居住的情况，一个生产专业队办一个公共食堂，或是几个生产专业队联合办一个公共食堂。有些地方社员居住过于分散，食堂还在每个小庄分成几个点，给社员以很大便利。
    舒茶人民公社为了办好公共食堂，建立了一套管理食堂的组织。社委会确定由一位副社长专门负责指挥食堂工作和其他供应工作。每个生产大队设生活大队长一人，生活大队长一般都由生产大队长兼任。每个食堂设立了管理委员会，有委员五人至七人，吸收能及时反映社员意见、善于勤俭持家、大公无私的社员和食堂管理人员、社队负责人充任。这些委员中有妇女、老年、青年；这样就可以充分反映各方面的意见。
    在食堂管理制度方面，建立了粮食管理、会议、检查等制度。粮食由公社按标准统一调拨、统一管理，分批分月直接分配到食堂。食堂管理委员会每月召开四次会议，研究如何改进食堂工作。每个食堂不断地征求群众的意见改进工作。如有些食堂开始做的饭很硬，有些老年社员有意见，于是食堂就专为他们做几锅软饭。为了产妇和小孩子的方便，很多食堂还专门购买了几口锅，谁家有产妇或小孩就用公锅打饭回去烧热了吃。
    在副食品供应方面，根据自力更生的原则，尽量满足社员的需要。每个食堂都自己种蔬菜、做豆腐、养猪。公社划给每个食堂平均每人二分至三分地种蔬菜，每个食堂都确定一至三人专种蔬菜和养猪，食堂其他的人在空隙时间也帮助种蔬菜。现在每个食堂都已养猪二、三十头，种了几十亩菜园，一般每人每天已经可以吃到一斤新鲜蔬菜，每一个到两个星期能吃到半斤猪肉。
    舒茶人民公社很重视食堂卫生工作。每个食堂组织了三人至五人的卫生小组，规定每天打扫三次。现在每个食堂厨具和饭菜都很清洁。
    由于妇女摆脱了家务琐事，投入集体生产，现在这个公社平均每天参加生产的劳动力比办食堂前增加五、六千个。很多妇女还参加了炼铁和其他工业生产。
    舒茶人民公社的公共食堂由于不断地听取群众的意见改进工作，受到了群众的欢迎和赞扬。卫星大队妇女陈立说：“食堂真正好，孩子少哭，妈妈少急，不要烧饭，拿碗就吃。以前地里家里一把抓，出去两头挂；现在专业化，个个当专家，人人为着我，我又为大家。”
