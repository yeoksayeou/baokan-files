Anshan, October 22 (from our newspaper) – Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) is launching a massive mass movement to ensure the overfulfillment of the task of producing 4.5 million tons of steel. From the very beginning, the mass movement has continuously pushed production to new heights. In the 21 days from September 25th to October 15th, Angang, without increasing any equipment or manpower, increased the average daily steel output by more than 1,460 tons compared to the average daily output in the first two weeks of September. The number of high-yield "satellites" released by various factories and mines has increased several times over.

On September 25th, Li Fuchun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, made a mobilization report at a mass meeting of 30,000 workers in Angang. On the same day, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC organized workers to conduct a thorough airing of views, a great debate, on how to liberate their thinking and overfulfill the task of steel production. In the debate, the workers conducted a comprehensive inspection of production through seminars, big-character posters, and other forms, and exposed and criticized various kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas and dogmatism that blindly believed in books and predecessors. They put forward many revolutionary measures and implemented these measures themselves.

Angang's experience proves that using the method of mass movement to lead production can effectively overcome various erroneous ideas that hinder production development and change the stagnant situation in production. After the steel plants handed over the October production tasks and the recent high-yield weekly production targets to the workers for discussion, the workers put forward many measures and suggestions for completing the plans and criticized the shortcomings in production. After debate, the production targets proposed by the masses exceeded the plans proposed by the leadership. In the past, it took 30 hours for the No. 2 Steel Plant to overhaul a 100-ton crane. After mobilizing the masses, the workers actively looked for "tricks" and found ways to repair it in only nine hours. In the past, it took a week to heighten a molten steel ladle; now, one is heightened in a day. Many problems that the leadership originally thought were difficult to solve were easily solved by consulting with the masses. The broad masses of workers were full of energy and unwilling to lag behind. In the past, there was overtime pay for overtime work; now, if it is proposed to give workers overtime pay, it will be criticized by the workers. Workers in many factories have automatically organized amateur shock teams to help solve problems wherever they arise. In the steel plants, ingot casting workers often raise big-character posters demanding quick steel tapping and send them to steelmaking workers immediately after casting ingots; when steelmaking workers find that the sulfur content of molten iron is high, affecting steelmaking time, they raise big-character posters demanding desulfurization and send them to ironmaking workers to the sound of gongs and drums. This practice, which was previously ridiculed as "irregular" and "guerrilla habits," has now become a huge force for promoting production.

In the past, some people in Angang believed that the various links in a large enterprise were closely connected, and that if one link had a problem, it would affect the overall situation. Therefore, they worried that the mass movement would cause "trouble" and affect centralized and unified leadership. But the opposite is true. After the masses were mobilized, the spirit of mass communist cooperation was unprecedentedly high, which greatly strengthened the centralized and unified leadership. In the past, it was often difficult for the company manager to transfer equipment and workers from one factory to another. Recently, the steel ingot mold factory lacked crane drivers, and several factories simultaneously sent crane drivers to support it without a company manager's order. In the past, the steel plant had been asking the leadership to solve the crane problem. The company asked them to solve it themselves, but they could not understand it ideologically, and the problem could not be solved. Recently, they criticized "the theory of sole reliance on conditions" and mobilized the masses to use ground cranes and other methods to alleviate the tension of cranes. Due to the improvement of workers' consciousness, a new situation of workers supervising each other's production and consciously abiding by labor discipline has recently emerged in many factories.

In the past, some people believed that large enterprises had complex technology and new equipment, and that only a few experts could solve problems. The experience of this movement proves that the working masses have infinite wisdom and can completely operate complex technical equipment. Some blast furnaces in the ironmaking plant had been producing poorly in the past, mainly because the production leadership was in the hands of a few technical personnel whose ideology was not thoroughly reformed. In this mass movement, various erroneous ideas of technical personnel were criticized, and the working masses were mobilized to think about measures and put forward methods around key production issues. New situations appeared in production in a short period of time. Many new technologies and new measures that have recently appeared in the No. 1 Steel Plant were put forward by the working masses. Among them, the old worker Liu Tieling himself proposed and successfully tested a new method of blowing compressed air during the melting period of steel, which can shorten the smelting time of each furnace of steel by 20 minutes. Hou Yingwu, a steelmaking worker in the No. 2 Steel Plant's No. 16 open-hearth furnace, has only been a steelmaking worker for a few months, but he has created a set of fast steelmaking methods, which reduces the time for smelting a furnace of steel from more than ten hours in the past to more than six hours. The fastest time only took five hours and ten minutes, setting a new national record for large open-hearth steelmaking furnaces.

The huge power formed by the mass movement has also promoted the liberation of the leadership's thinking. After a thorough airing of views and a great debate, the director of the No. 1 Steel Plant successively put forward two innovation suggestions with great significance, such as the mixed steelmaking method and the use of steel frames to support steel ladles, which played a great role in increasing steel production. The transportation department closely cooperated with the railway department, abolished the old set of rules and regulations, and shortened the time that locomotives and vehicles stayed in Angang from more than 20 hours in the past to 11 hours in recent days.

The mass movement in Angang is currently not developing evenly enough. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the CPC is now taking measures to promote the healthier development of this movement. (Attached pictures)

### 只有充分发挥群众力量才能充分运用优越条件  “大”“洋”不能离“群”  鞍钢大搞群众运动把生产推向新的高峰

    只有充分发挥群众力量才能充分运用优越条件
    “大”“洋”不能离“群”
    鞍钢大搞群众运动把生产推向新的高峰
    本报鞍山22日电　鞍钢正在开展一个声势浩大的群众运动，来保证超额完成生产四百五十万吨钢的任务。群众运动一开始就把生产不断地推向新的高峰。从9月25日到10月15日的二十一天中，鞍钢没有增加任何设备和人力，就使每天的钢产量平均比9月上中两旬的每天产量增加了一千四百六十多吨。各厂矿放出的高产“卫星”的数量，增加了好几倍。
    9月25日，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李富春同志在鞍钢召开的三万职工的群众大会上作了动员报告，中共鞍山市委当天就组织职工就如何解放思想、超额完成钢铁生产任务的问题，展开了大鸣大放大辩论。职工们在辩论中通过座谈会、大字报等形式，对生产进行了全面检查，对形形色色的右倾保守思想和迷信书本、迷信前人的教条主义进行了揭露和批判，提出了许多革命性措施，并且自己动手来实现这些措施。
    鞍钢的经验证明，采用群众运动的方法领导生产，就可以有效地克服阻碍生产发展的各种错误思想，改变生产上冷冷清清的局面。各炼钢厂在把10月份生产任务和最近高产周生产指标交给工人讨论以后，工人们就提出了许多完成计划的措施和建议，也批评了生产中的缺点。经过辩论，群众提出的生产指标都超过了领导提出的计划。第二炼钢厂检修一台百吨吊车，过去要三十个小时，经过发动群众，工人积极找“窍门”想办法，只用九个小时就修好了。过去加高一个钢水罐要一个星期，现在一天就加高了一个。许多原来领导认为不好解决的问题，一同群众商量，就都迎刃而解。广大职工干劲冲天，谁也不甘落后。过去加班有加班费，现在如果提出给工人加班费，就要受到工人的批评。许多工厂的工人自动组织了业余突击队，哪里有困难，就到哪里去帮助解决。在炼钢厂，铸锭工人往往一铸完锭，就抬起要求快出钢的大字报送给炼钢工人；炼钢工人一发现铁水含硫高，影响炼钢时间，就抬着要求除硫的大字报，敲锣打鼓地送给炼铁工人。这种过去被人讥为“不正规”、“游击习气”的做法，现在成了推动生产的巨大力量。
    过去鞍钢有些人认为，大企业各个环节衔接很紧，一个环节出了问题就要影响全盘，因此担心群众运动会出“乱子”，会影响集中统一领导。但是事实恰巧相反。群众发动起来以后，群众共产主义协作精神空前高涨，大大加强了集中统一领导。从前公司经理要从一个厂抽调设备和工人给另一个工厂，往往很困难，最近钢锭模厂缺少吊车司机，没有公司经理调令，就有几个厂同时抽出吊车司机去支援。炼钢厂过去一直要求领导给解决吊车问题，公司要他们自己解决，他们思想不通，问题解决不了。最近他们批判了“唯条件论”，发动群众采用地吊等办法，缓和了吊车紧张的情况。由于职工觉悟的提高，在许多工厂最近都出现了工人互相监督生产、自觉遵守劳动纪律的新局面。
    过去有人认为，大企业技术复杂，设备新，只有少数专家才能解决问题。这次运动的经验证明，工人群众有着无穷的智慧，完全可以驾驶复杂的技术装备。炼铁厂有些高炉过去生产一直不好，主要原因就是生产领导掌握在少数思想改造不彻底的技术人员的手里。在这次群众运动中，批判了技术人员的各种错误思想，发动工人群众围绕生产关键问题，想措施，提办法，生产上短期内就出现了新的气象。第一炼钢厂最近出现的许多新技术新措施，都是工人群众提出来的，其中老工人刘铁岭自己提出自己试验成功的钢水熔化期吹压缩空气的新操作法，可使每炉钢的冶炼时间缩短二十分钟。第二炼钢厂十六号平炉炼钢工侯英武，当炼钢工还只有几个月，已创造了一套快速炼钢的方法，使炼一炉钢的时间由过去的十多个小时减到六个多小时，最快时只用了五点十分钟，创造了全国大型平炼钢炉新纪录。
    群众运动所形成的巨大力量，也促进了领导思想的解放。第一炼钢厂厂长经过大鸣大放大辩论，先后提出了混合炼钢法、用钢架托钢罐等两项有很大意义的革新建议，对提高钢产量起了很大作用。运输部门同铁路部门密切协作，废除了旧的一套规章制度，使最近几天机车车辆在鞍钢停留的时间，由过去二十多个小时缩短为十一个小时。
    鞍钢的群众运动目前发展得还不够平衡，中共鞍山市委现在正在采取措施，来推动这个运动更加健全地发展。（附图片）
