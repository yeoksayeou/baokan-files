Shattering the Spiritual Shackles of the People

The Concept of Divine Authority – Ropes that Bind the People's Spirit

The underworld system composed of King Yama, City God, and even the Earth God, and the system of immortals composed of the Jade Emperor and various deities and monsters – collectively referred to as the ghost and god system, or the concept of divine authority – was the superstructure of old Chinese society. This decadent ideology, like a rope, long bound the Chinese people, especially the vast peasantry, in spirit. It paralyzed the revolutionary will of the peasants, hindered the development of class struggle, and limited the peasants' courage to struggle against nature, obstructing the development of their wisdom. This anti-scientific superstitious concept permeated the entire production and life of the peasants. Whether it was plowing, sowing, harvesting, or storing, whether it was birth, aging, illness, or death, they had to burn incense and make vows, seek divine guidance, and obey the dictates of ghosts and gods and fate. This rope of divine authority not only bound the peasants spiritually but also placed a heavy economic burden on them. In the past, in addition to being exploited by landlords and rich peasants, the peasants were also exploited by ghosts and gods. They had to take a portion of the grain they earned from their hard labor and spend it on ghosts and gods. According to materials from several agricultural cooperatives in Anhui, before liberation, an average lower-middle peasant household spent money on burning incense and paper, sometimes reaching over a hundred catties of rice a year. In the event of funerals, the waste from superstitious activities was even greater.

Successive Mass Movements – Shocks to the Concept of Divine Authority

"People's consciousness changes with their living conditions, their social relations, and their social life" (Communist Manifesto). In China's long revolutionary struggle, especially in the process of revolution and construction since liberation, the concept of divine authority has been subjected to several fierce shocks. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out thirty years ago in "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "Once the landlord's power is overthrown, clan authority, divine authority, and husband authority will all be shaken." Since liberation, with the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the establishment of New China, and the subsequent land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and a series of social reforms, the reactionary regimes in the vast rural areas that served as the foundation of feudal superstition and other powers were destroyed. The concept of divine authority suffered a violent shock throughout the country, the position of atheism expanded, and the power of the ghost and god system gradually weakened. Not long after liberation, many monasteries and temples in various places were converted into schools and warehouses. The grand temple fairs held every spring disappeared, and the burning of incense began to decrease. After the land reform movement, the landlord class was overthrown, and ancestral halls were used as schools. Many superstitious customs previously presided over, led, and actively maintained by landlords, rich peasants, and clan leaders were changed. Superstitious activities were greatly reduced. Those who made a living from superstition – feng shui masters, fortune-tellers, witches, spirit mediums, etc. – were allocated land, and some began to participate in labor. Through this fierce class struggle, the vast peasantry was not only liberated from the shackles of feudal land ownership but also began to be liberated from the shackles of the concept of divine authority.

The publicity for the general line of the transition period in 1953 and the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in 1955 dealt another fierce blow to the concept of divine authority. After the high tide of cooperativization, due to the fundamental changes in the relations of production in the countryside, people's ideological consciousness also underwent a series of significant changes. The concept of divine authority and old superstitious customs also changed further. The burning of incense and worship of Buddha decreased even more. With the popularization of medicine and hygiene, many peasants no longer sought divine help when they were sick but consulted doctors. Many water conservancy projects that could not be built in the past due to superstition were also started. Those who made a living from superstition have basically changed to proper occupations.

In general, from the national liberation in 1949 until after the high tide of cooperativization, the concept of divine authority was in the process of gradual weakening. However, this process was not a straight line. The struggle between divine authority and anti-divine authority also rose and fell, progressing in waves, along with the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution, and the struggle to transform nature. When the high tide of social reform movements arrived and the struggle to transform nature progressed smoothly, the concept of divine authority would be significantly weakened. When capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside raised their heads, class enemies stirred, or natural disasters were severe, superstitious thoughts would struggle to rise again. However, after the above two violent shocks, and after several years of repeated struggles, its class foundation and social forces have been destroyed. The general trend is to gradually weaken.

The Great Leap Forward – A Thorough Cleaning of the Concept of Divine Authority

The socialist great debate since last winter, especially the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, has been the most thorough and most violent shock to the concept of divine authority. In many areas, peasants naturally launched a massive struggle to eliminate superstition and change customs. Through this shock and struggle, another foundation of the concept of divine authority, namely, the state of people's powerlessness in the face of nature, has also been destroyed, finally prompting the ghost and god system to begin a comprehensive collapse.

The violent impact of the Great Leap Forward in production since this spring on the concept of divine authority is concentrated in the mass actions of dismantling land temples and leveling graves to prepare land. The Earth Gods that the peasants used to worship and kneel before were either thrown under the pot or smashed to pieces. All the land temples were swept away in a few short days, and the bricks and tiles that were dismantled were used to build roads, broadcasting stations, propaganda pavilions, and toilets. The graves of the dead standing in the fertile fields, which had been considered sacred and inviolable for thousands of years, were all moved or deeply buried on the spot by the peasants themselves in this struggle. This struggle to eliminate superstition and change customs was entirely initiated by the peasant masses themselves. The dismantling of land temples and leveling of graves in Chaoxian County was entirely a spontaneous action by the masses. When one team started doing it, the entire commune immediately followed suit; when one commune started doing it, other communes immediately followed suit. The reason why the vast peasant masses were able to act so spontaneously is, on the one hand, the urgent demand of the masses for rapid increase in production during the Great Leap Forward in production. The vast peasantry has profoundly realized from their own production practice that the land temples and tombs, etc., everywhere supported by the ghost and god system, are serious obstacles to the development of production. On the other hand, the Great Leap Forward in production has enhanced the peasants' confidence and courage in overcoming the forces of nature. Water can be diverted over mountains, and bumper harvests can be achieved even in severe droughts. These miracles that only existed in myths in the past are now created by the working people themselves with their own hands under the leadership of the Party. This shows that the working people of our country are not only no longer slaves of the old society and have become masters of the new society, but they are also no longer slaves belonging to the forces of nature and have begun to become masters of nature. This situation shows that the time has really come to break the shackles of the ghost and god system, just like "the melon falls off when it is ripe" and "the water flows when the channel is dug." As long as someone "guides" it, the peasants will naturally rise up in a rush. The rapid formation of a mass upsurge of eliminating superstition in various places is by no means accidental.

The Great Debate – A Good Way to Eliminate the Concept of Divine Authority

In this ideological revolution to eliminate superstition and change customs, there will naturally be contradictions, and the struggle between atheism and theism runs through the entire struggle. According to surveys of some agricultural cooperatives, the actions of Party members, Youth League members, and young peasants are the most active and resolute. They are the vanguards of this revolutionary struggle. The majority of poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their enthusiastic support, and some middle-of-the-roaders and even backward elements also changed their attitudes, expressing their approval and participating in the struggle. Atheistic thought occupies an absolute advantage. However, there are also a few well-to-do middle peasants who have resistance, and some older peasants also have ideological difficulties. They are afraid that dismantling the temples will offend the "Bodhisattva" and that moving the graves will "ruin the feng shui." Since the opposition universally exists, it is inevitable to launch a great debate on whether there are gods, whether there are ghosts, whether there is feng shui, and whether there is fate. These meetings are all held vibrantly and are full of humor. When debating whether there are gods, many people say: "Where are the gods? No one has ever seen them. In the past, almost every family burned incense and worshipped gods, but the poor were still poor and exploited. Now, not a single incense stick is burned, and life is better year by year." Xu Shouye, director of Daishan Commune in Chaoxian County, said: "The Bodhisattva is made of wood. The same piece of wood, the upper half is carved into a Bodhisattva, and people burn incense and kowtow to it. The lower half is made into a chamber pot, and people use it for urination and defecation. To say that this half of the wood has a spirit and the other half of the wood has no spirit, isn't this deceiving people?" When debating whether there are ghosts, everyone said: "When a person dies, it is like a lamp going out. There are no ghosts at all. Now that the graves are leveled or moved, we haven't seen any ghosts." When debating whether there is feng shui or fate, in the face of countless conclusive facts, the feng shui masters and fortune-tellers were refuted to the point of being speechless and had to admit defeat, admitting that so-called "feng shui" and "eight characters" are all deceitful nonsense. Li Shirong, a poor peasant from Liaoyuan Commune in Feidong County, said: "In the past, I worked as a long-term laborer in the house of landlord Wang Youqing. All year round, the whole family could not even fill their stomachs. When the New Year came, I wanted to borrow a few斗 of rice from the landlord. Not only was he unwilling to lend it to me, but he also sarcastically said: 'Who told your family's ancestral grave not to exert itself?' In the past, I was deceived by the landlord and thought that his family's ancestral grave was 'powerful' and our family's ancestral grave had 'bad feng shui.' After liberation, the landlord was overthrown, and Wang Youqing was also arrested for labor reform. How come his ancestral grave is not 'powerful' anymore? After land reform and cooperativization, the peasants' lives are getting better day by day. Is it because the ancestral grave has suddenly become 'powerful'? Isn't this superstition?" Many peasants say: "The leadership of the Communist Party is 'good luck,' and New China is full of 'good feng shui.'"

The Great Leap Forward in production has promoted the struggle of the peasant masses to eliminate superstition and free themselves from the shackles of the concept of divine authority. The victory of the peasant masses' struggle to level graves, dismantle temples, and oppose the concept of divine authority has in turn promoted a more vigorous leap forward in production. When the peasants are freed from the shackles of the rope of divine authority, they will more bravely march towards conquering nature. Since May of this year, Chaoxian and Feidong counties in Anhui Province have not had a thorough rain for more than a hundred days. The drought situation has greatly exceeded the heaviest drought in history in 1934, but no one has advocated carrying Bodhisattvas to pray for rain, and no one has been found burning incense and making vows. The people's enthusiasm for fighting drought is greater than the sky and higher than the mountains. They compare themselves to "Bodhisattvas" and "Dragon Kings," determined to overcome the drought with collective strength and strive for a bumper harvest. "Commune members are all Dragon Kings, commanding lake water to ascend mountain ridges!" has become the peasants' slogan of action.

Our Task – Thoroughly Eradicating the Concept of Divine Authority

On the issue of whether there are gods or not, Marxists are militant materialists and advocate thorough atheism. From the perspective of historical materialism, superstition of ghosts and gods is an inevitable historical product in the development of human society. It is the manifestation of humans seeking help from mysterious forces in the face of incomprehensible and seemingly irresistible natural and social forces. It is a grotesque, illusory, and distorted reflection of reality in people's consciousness. In the early stages of human history, people's weakness and fear of natural forces when struggling with nature gave rise to the belief in ghosts and gods and souls. After the emergence of class society, in addition to the natural forces that ruled people, social forces were added. The exploited classes lived extremely painful lives. When they were unable to struggle with the exploiting classes, they would inevitably produce the belief in fate and the worship of ghosts and gods. The exploiting classes, seeing that the concept of divine authority was conducive to their rule, vigorously supported it, cultivated it, and used it to numb the people. Therefore, in the old society, the concept of divine authority was widely spread and developed. This is the epistemological root and social class root of the emergence and long-term existence of superstition. Marxist atheism has an essential difference from pre-Marxist atheism. Pre-Marxist atheists, both Chinese Wang Chong and Fan Zhen, or the French materialists of the eighteenth century, could not see the class roots and social roots of the ghost and god system. Therefore, when they fought against superstitious religious theism, they generally only limited themselves to exposing its epistemological roots. They often regarded raising cultural levels and popularizing education as the main means of eliminating superstition, and restricted the struggle to the small circle of "culturalism." Marxist atheism believes that the rule of the exploiting classes and the enslavement of people by natural forces are the ultimate source of all superstitious ideas of divine authority. To completely eliminate the superstitious ideas of ghosts and gods, on the one hand, it is naturally necessary to spread scientific knowledge and widely publicize atheistic ideas. This is a component of Marxist propaganda, and it is an important task. But on the other hand, which is also the main aspect, it is necessary to combine the elimination of superstition with the struggle to transform society and transform nature. Lenin once said: "Marxists should be materialists, that is, people who resolutely oppose religion, but they should be dialectical materialists, that is, they should not abstractly raise the question of the anti-religious struggle, and should not carry out the anti-religious struggle based on abstract, purely theoretical, and immutable teachings, but should specifically raise this question, should raise this question based on the class struggle that is currently actually being carried out and can best educate the broad masses." ("Socialism and Religion") Lenin's instructions on the religious question are also fully applicable to the general superstitious ideas of ghosts and gods among the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong once clearly instructed us: "...The destruction of familism, superstitious ideas, and incorrect male-female relationships is a natural result of the victory of political struggle and economic struggle." "The Bodhisattvas are erected by the peasants, and at a certain time, the peasants will use their own hands to discard these Bodhisattvas, without the need for others to discard the Bodhisattvas too early. The propaganda policy of the Communist Party on these things should be: 'Guide but do not fire, leap like this.' The Bodhisattvas must be discarded by the peasants themselves, and the martyr's shrines and chastity arches must be destroyed by the peasants themselves. It is wrong for others to do it for them" ("Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"). In the long revolutionary struggle and in the revolutionary and construction process since liberation, our Party has resolutely implemented the instructions of Lenin and Comrade Mao Zedong. Therefore, we have achieved significant achievements in the elimination of superstition, gradually freeing the broad masses from the shackles of divine authority and gaining spiritual liberation step by step. This is the victory of Marxist-Leninist atheism, and this is the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's atheistic thought.

With the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political and ideological fronts, our country has entered a new period of technological revolution and the cultural revolution that goes hand in hand with the technological revolution. Eliminating superstition and changing customs is an important content of the cultural revolution. We must, on the basis of the existing victories, guide a wider range of people to participate in this unprecedented struggle to eliminate the superstition of ghosts and gods, use atheism to defeat theism, completely change social customs, completely change the spiritual outlook of the people, and promote the continuous and victorious advance of socialist and even future communist construction.

    打碎人民精神上的枷锁
    陆学斌
    神权观念——束缚人民精神的绳索
    由阎罗天子、城隍老爷以至土地菩萨组成的阴间系统以及由玉皇大帝以至各种神怪组成的神仙系统——总称为鬼神系统的神权观念，是旧中国社会的上层建筑。这种腐朽的意识形态，像一条绳索长期地在精神上束缚着中国人民，尤其是广大农民。它麻痹了农民的革命意志，阻碍了阶级斗争的开展；它限制了农民向自然斗争的勇气，阻碍了农民智慧的发展。这种反科学的迷信观念，贯穿在农民的整个生产与生活当中，不论耕、种、收、藏，不论生、老、病、死，都要烧香许愿，求神问卜，听从鬼神和命运的摆布。这条神权的绳索不仅在精神上束缚着农民，而且在经济上也造成农民沉重的负担。过去农民除了受地主、富农的剥削以外，还受着鬼神的剥削，在自己辛勤劳动所换来的一些粮食中，还要拿出一部分花在鬼神的身上，根据安徽几个农业社的材料，解放以前，一户普通的下中农，每年花费在烧香烧纸上的钱，有的一年竟要达到一百多斤稻谷，遇到丧葬，迷信活动的浪费，数字就更大得多了。
    历次群众运动——对神权观念的冲击
     “人们的意识，是随着人们的生活条件，人们的社会关系，人们的社会生活改变而改变的”（共产党宣言）。在我国长期的革命斗争中，特别是在解放以后革命和建设的过程中，神权观念受到了几次猛烈的冲击。正如三十年前毛泽东同志在“湖南农民运动考察报告”中所论述的那样：“地主政权既被打翻，族权、神权、夫权便一概跟着动摇起来”。解放以来，随着国民党反动统治的崩溃，新中国的成立，以及随后进行的土地改革、镇压反革命等一系列的社会改革，摧毁了广大农村中作为封建迷信等权力基干的反动政权，神权观念在全国范围内受到了一次猛烈冲击，无神论思想阵地扩大，鬼神系统的势力渐渐削弱。在刚刚解放不久，不少地方的庵庙，都先后改成了学校和仓库，每年春季庙里盛大的香会没有了，烧香的也开始减少了。土地改革运动后，地主阶级被打倒，祠堂都做了学校。过去地主、富农、族长等主持、带头和积极维护的很多迷信习俗都改变了。迷信活动大为减少。迷信职业者——地理先生、算命先生、巫神、超亡婆等等分得了土地，有的开始参加劳动。经过这一场猛烈的阶级斗争，广大农民不仅从封建土地所有制的枷锁下解放出来，而且也开始从神权观念的枷锁下解放出来。
    1953年过渡时期总路线宣传和1955年农业合作化的高潮，神权观念再一次受到猛烈的冲击。在合作化高潮以后，由于农村中的生产关系有了根本的改变，人们的思想意识也发生了一系列的重大变化，神权观念和旧的迷信习俗也跟着进一步的变化。烧香、拜菩萨的更加减少了；随着医药卫生的普及，很多农民在生病的时候，不再求神拜佛，而是请医生诊治了；很多过去因迷信而不能兴修的水利工程，也动工兴修了；迷信职业者基本上都已改务正业了。
    总的说来，从1949年全国解放直到合作化高潮以后，神权观念是处于逐步削弱的过程中，但是这个过程并不是一条直线，神权与反神权的斗争，也是随着农村中的两条道路的斗争、革命与反革命的斗争以及改造自然的斗争而时起时伏，波浪式地向前发展。当社会改革运动高潮到来和改造自然的斗争顺利开展的时候，神权观念就会显著的削弱；当农村中资本主义自发势力抬头，阶级敌人蠢动或者自然灾害严重的时候，迷信思想又会挣扎抬头。但神权观念经过上述两次猛烈的冲击，经过几年来这样反复的斗争，它的阶级基础和社会力量已受到了摧毁，总的趋势是在逐步削弱下去的。
    大跃进——对神权观念的大扫除
    去年冬季以来的社会主义大辩论，特别是农业生产上的大跃进，这是对神权观念一次最彻底、最猛烈的冲击。不少地区的农民很自然的掀起了一个声势浩大的破除迷信、移风易俗的斗争。经过这次冲击与斗争，已使神权观念的另一基础，即人们在大自然面前无能为力的状况，也受到摧毁，终于促使鬼神系统开始全面性的土崩瓦解。
    今春以来的生产大跃进运动对于神权观念的猛烈冲击，集中表现在群众性的拆除土地庙和平坟整地的行动上。过去农民对之供奉跪拜的土地菩萨，有的被丢到锅底下，有的被打得稀烂，全部土地庙在短短的几天内一扫而光，拆出的砖瓦用来修了道路报、广播台、宣传亭和厕所。矗立在良田中的死人坟墓，千百年来都认为是神圣不可侵犯的东西，在这次斗争中，都被农民自己动手移掉或者就地深葬了。这一场破除迷信、移风易俗的斗争，完全是农民群众自己发动起来的。巢县的拆除土地庙和平坟整地的斗争，则完全是群众的自发行动，一个队干起来，全社马上跟着干；一个社干起来，其他社也马上跟着干。广大农民群众所以能这样自发地行动起来，一方面是生产大跃进中群众对于迅速增加生产的迫切要求，广大农民从自己的生产实践当中已经深刻地体会到鬼神系统所依托的、到处普遍存在的土地庙和坟墓等等，是发展生产的严重障碍。另一方面是生产大跃进提高了农民对于战胜自然力的胜利信心与勇气。引水可以过山，大旱可以丰产，这些过去只有神话里才有的奇迹，今天在党的领导下，劳动人民自己用双手创造出来了，这表明我国劳动人民不仅早已不再是旧社会的奴隶，成为新社会的主人，而且已不再是隶属于自然力量的奴隶，开始成为大自然的主人。这种情况正说明打碎鬼神系统的枷锁，真是已经到了“瓜熟蒂落”、“水到渠成”的时候。只要有人一“引”，农民就会自然而然地一轰而起，各地一个群众性的破除迷信的高潮所以能迅速地形成，决不是偶然的。
    大辩论——破除神权观念的好方法
    在这一场破除迷信、移风易俗的思想革命里，自然不会没有矛盾，无神论与有神论的斗争就始终贯穿在整个斗争过程中。根据一些农业社的调查，党员、团员和青年农民的行动最积极、最坚决，他们是这一场革命斗争的急先锋；大多数贫农和下中农表示热烈拥护，有些中间分子甚至落后分子也转变了态度，表示赞成，参加到斗争中来；无神论思想占着绝对的优势。但是，也有少数富裕中农有抵触情绪，老年农民中也有些人思想不通，他们怕拆庙会得罪“菩萨”，怕迁坟会“败了风水”。既然对立面普遍存在，就不可避免要展开一场有没有神、有没有鬼、有没有风水和有没有命运的大辩论。这些会都开得有声有色，都富有风趣。在辩论有没有神的时候，很多人都说：“神仙在哪里？没有一个人看到过。过去差不多家家烧香敬神，穷苦人家还是照样受穷受剥削，现在一根香不烧，日子一年反比一年好。”巢县岱山社主任徐守叶说：“菩萨本是木头雕的，同一块木头，上半截雕个菩萨，人们就向他烧香磕头，下半截做个马桶，人们就用来大小便。说这半截木头有灵，那半截木头没有灵，这不是骗人吗？”在辩论到有没有鬼的时候，大家都说：“人死如灯灭，根本没有鬼。现在坟墓平的平，迁的迁，也没有见到鬼在哪里。”在辩论有没有风水、有没有命运的时候，在无数确凿的事实面前，地理先生和算命先生被驳得闭口无言，不得不表示服输，承认所谓“风水”和“八字”都是骗人的鬼话。肥东燎原社的贫农李世荣说：“过去我在地主王佑庆家里做长工，一年到头，一家人都糊不住嘴，过年时想向地主借几斗米，他不但不肯借，还讽刺说：‘谁叫你家祖坟不出力气？’过去受地主欺骗，还以为是他家祖坟‘得力’，自家祖坟‘风水不好’。解放后，地主打倒了，王佑庆也捉去劳改了，怎么他的祖坟不‘得力’了？经过土改和合作化，农民的日子一天比一天好，难道是祖坟一下‘得力’了？这不是迷信是什么？”很多农民都说：“共产党的领导就是‘好运气’，新中国处处都是‘好风水’”。
    生产大跃进推动了农民群众破除迷信、解除神权观念束缚的斗争，农民群众的平坟拆庙反神权观念斗争的胜利，反过来又促进生产更猛烈的跃进。当农民们摆脱了神权绳索的束缚以后，就更加英勇的向征服大自然进军。今年5月以来，安徽巢县、肥东两县一百多天未落透雨，旱情大大超过历史上旱灾最重的1934年，但没有一个人主张抬菩萨求雨，也没有发现一户烧香许愿。人们的抗旱劲头比天还大，比山还高。他们把自己比做“菩萨”，比做“龙王”，决心以集体的力量战胜干旱，力争丰收。“社员个个当龙王，喝令湖水上山岗！”成了农民们的行动口号。
    我们的任务——彻底肃清神权观念
    在有神无神的问题上，马克思主义者是战斗的唯物论者，主张彻底的无神论。从历史唯物论的观点看来，迷信鬼神是人类社会发展过程中必然的历史产物，是人类在不能理解的、认为是不可抗拒的自然力量和社会力量面前，求助于神秘力量的表现，是现实在人们意识中荒诞的、虚幻的、歪曲的反映。在人类历史的初期，人们在与自然作斗争时软弱无力和对自然力量的恐惧，就产生了相信鬼神和灵魂的思想，到了阶级社会产生以后，在统治着人们的自然力量以外，又加上了社会力量，被剥削阶级过着极端痛苦的生活，在他们无力与剥削阶级斗争时，也必然会产生迷信命运的思想和对于鬼神的崇拜。剥削阶级鉴于神权观念有利于他们的统治，就极力地支持它，培植它，用它来麻醉人民，因而，在旧社会中，神权观念得到广泛的传播和发展。这就是迷信产生和长期存在的认识根源和社会阶级根源。马克思主义的无神论与马克思以前的无神论有本质的区别。马克思主义以前的中外无神论者，不论中国的王充、范缜也好，或者十八世纪的法国唯物论者也好，他们都看不清鬼神系统的阶级根源与社会根源，所以他们在和迷信宗教有神论作斗争时，一般只限于揭露其认识论根源，他们常常把提高文化水平，普及教育作为破除迷信的主要手段，把斗争局限于“文化主义”的小圈子里。而马克思主义的无神论则认为，剥削阶级的统治和自然力对人们的奴役是一切神权迷信思想的最终根源，要彻底破除鬼神的迷信思想，一方面，自然必须传播科学知识，广泛宣传无神论的思想，这是马克思主义宣传的组成部分，这是件重要的工作；但是另一方面，也是主要的方面，必须把破除迷信和改造社会、改造自然的斗争结合起来。列宁曾经说过：“马克思主义者应当是唯物主义者，即坚决反对宗教的人，但他们应当是辩证唯物主义者，就是说，他们不应抽象提出反宗教斗争的问题，不应根据抽象的，纯粹理论上的，始终不变的说教来进行反宗教斗争，而应具体提出这个问题，应根据目前实际在进行的和最能教育广大群众的阶级斗争提出这个问题。”（“社会主义与宗教”）列宁关于宗教问题的指示，对于群众一般的鬼神迷信思想来说，也是完全适用的。毛泽东同志曾经明确指示我们：“……家族主义、迷信观念和不正确的男女关系之破坏，乃是政治斗争和经济斗争胜利以后自然而然的结果。”“菩萨是农民立起来的，到了一定时期农民会用他们自己的双手丢开这些菩萨，无须旁人过早地代庖丢菩萨。共产党对于这些东西的宣传政策应当是：‘引而不发，跃如也。’菩萨要农民自己去丢，烈女祠、节孝坊要农民自己去摧毁、别人代庖是不对的”（“湖南农民运动考察报告”）。在长期的革命斗争中和解放以来的革命和建设过程中，我们党坚决地执行了列宁和毛泽东同志的指示，因此，在破除迷信问题上取得了重大的成绩，使广大群众逐步摆脱了神权绳索的束缚，一步一步获得了精神上的解放。这是马克思列宁主义无神论的胜利，这是毛泽东同志的无神论思想的胜利。
    随着经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的基本胜利，我国已经进入技术革命以及同技术革命相辅而行的文化革命的新时期。破除迷信，移风易俗，是文化革命的一个重要内容。我们必须在已有的胜利的基础上，引导更广泛的人民群众起来参加这一史无前例的破除鬼神迷信的斗争，以无神论去战胜有神论，彻底改变社会风气，彻底改变人民的精神面貌，推动社会主义以至将来共产主义建设事业不断地胜利前进。
