Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch from Taipei: According to an AFP report on the 13th, after the Ministry of National Defense's order for another two-week suspension of the Quemoy bombardment reached Taiwan, the Chiang Kai-shek clique felt even more "deeply uneasy" about two aspects of the situation. On the one hand, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is worried that their army's "morale will be shaken," and at the same time, they are worried about the attitude of the United States.

The AFP report stated that the Chinese government's peaceful statement to Taiwanese residents made the Taiwan authorities "fear that this propaganda will, in the long run, shake the morale of the soldiers, the vast majority of whom now have to be recruited from the Taiwanese."

At the same time, the news said that what caused the Chiang Kai-shek clique "panic" was that Taiwan authorities pointed out that "Washington may recently put pressure on Chiang Kai-shek to induce him to reduce the troops stationed on the coastal islands, and then demilitarize these islands." Taiwan authorities are currently holding "a bittersweet mood," "fearing that [the United States] will ask them to make sacrifices."

The "United Daily News," close to the Taiwan authorities, accused the United States on the 12th of acting "hesitantly, or at least not clearly enough" in the past week. The newspaper urged the United States to "formally announce the termination of the Warsaw talks" and "strengthen the concentration of forces in the Taiwan Strait" to "coordinate and cooperate with" the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "ensure Quemoy and Matsu."

A United Press International dispatch from Taipei on the 13th also stated that "American officials want the Nationalists to reduce the number of their troops stationed on the coastal islands," which made Taiwan authorities "official figures feel frustrated."

    我再停止炮轰金门的消息传到台湾
    蒋介石集团心事重重
    一怕军心动摇二怕美国施加压力
    新华社14日讯　台北消息：据法新社13日报道，我国防部命令对金门炮击再停两星期的消息传到台湾后，蒋介石集团对两方面的情况更加“深刻不安”。蒋介石集团一方面担心他们的军队会“士气动摇”，同时又担心着美国的态度。
    法新社消息说，中国政府对台湾居民发表的和平声明，使台湾当局领导人“担心这种宣传长远来说会动摇士兵的士气，这些士兵的极大部分现在不得不在台湾人中去征召”。
    同时，消息说，另一方面引起蒋介石集团“惊慌”的是，台湾当局人士指出，“华盛顿可能在最近向蒋介石施加压力，以促使他削减驻扎在沿海岛屿的部队，然后把这些岛屿非军事化”。台湾当局人士目前抱着“一种辛酸的心情”，“害怕（美国）要求他们作牺牲”。
    接近台湾当局的“联合报”在12日指责美国在过去一个星期表现得“犹豫不定，至少是态度不够鲜明”。这家报纸竭力要求美国“正式宣布终止华沙谈判”，并且“加强集结兵力于台湾海峡”，与蒋介石集团“协同配合以确保金马”。
    合众国际社台北13日消息也说，“美国官员们要国民党人减少他们驻在沿海岛屿上的部队的人数”，这使台湾当局“官方人士感到沮丧”。
