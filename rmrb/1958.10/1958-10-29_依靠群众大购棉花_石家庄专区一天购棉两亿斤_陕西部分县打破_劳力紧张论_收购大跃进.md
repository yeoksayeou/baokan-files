    Relying on the Masses to Purchase Cotton on a Large Scale
    Shijiazhuang Prefecture Purchases Two Hundred Million Jin of Cotton in One Day
    Some Counties in Shaanxi Break the "Labor Shortage Theory" and Achieve a Great Leap Forward in Purchasing

    (Reported by this newspaper) Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, the commercial departments of Shijiazhuang Prefecture fully mobilized and relied on the masses, launching a vigorous high tide of picking, transporting, and purchasing cotton. On October 21st, despite rain, wind, and muddy roads, the entire prefecture purchased 200 million jin of unginned cotton, a 30-fold increase compared to the highest daily purchase volume in previous years, setting a historical record. As of the 21st, a total of 185.5 million jin of ginned cotton had been purchased, completing 44.2% of the annual cotton purchase plan. Among them, Shulu and Luancheng counties had already overfulfilled the annual cotton purchase plan ahead of schedule.

    The Party committee taking the lead is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in cotton purchasing. To strengthen leadership in cotton picking and purchasing, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office held a telephone conference on the morning of the 21st, requiring all counties to launch a greater high tide of cotton harvesting while grasping steel production and deep plowing, working hard for five days and nights to collect 550 million jin of cotton, ensuring the completion of the cotton purchasing plan by the end of October. On the same day, the Party secretaries of various counties, people's communes, and production teams immediately mobilized the broad masses to launch a concentrated effort to pick and deliver cotton. The entire prefecture rearranged the labor force, organizing 1.6 million people and over 80,000 vehicles of all sizes to pick and transport cotton. Shulu County purchased 30 million jin of unginned cotton on the 21st. On the 20th, the four Party secretaries, five directors, and eleven department heads of the Zhangguzhuang Red Flag People's Commune in this county led more than 30,000 people to send 1.7 million jin of cotton to Xinji, which was 35 *hua li* away. They also transported 200,000 jin of scrap iron back, and brought back 2 million jin of coal and 42 large barrels of kerosene. All counties in the prefecture are expected to guarantee the completion of the annual cotton purchase task by the end of October.

    (Reported from Xi'an on the 28th by this newspaper) Two situations have emerged in Shaanxi Province's current cotton purchase work: one is being constrained by the thought of "labor shortage," resulting in slow progress in purchasing; the other is breaking through the "labor shortage theory," reversing the slow progress of purchasing. This year, Shaanxi Province has a bumper cotton harvest, but until the beginning of October, white cotton was still all over the fields with no one to pick it, and a small portion that was picked was not ginned. As of the 15th of this month, in the cotton-producing areas of Guanzhong, including Wugong, Mei County, Fufeng, Qian County, and Yao County, cotton purchased accounted for only 0.1% to 0.85% of the purchase task.

    The cadres and masses of the cotton-producing counties believe that the current labor force is too tight, and most of the labor force has been invested in urgent production tasks such as steel smelting, deep plowing, autumn harvesting, and autumn sowing, leaving few people to pick and gin cotton.

    In mid-October, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held a provincial telephone conference, requiring all localities to fully and rationally arrange labor through debate, and to concentrate on rushing to harvest cotton and purchase cotton. Huaxian County has a total of 80,000 laborers. At this time, nearly 80,000 laborers had been dispatched to invest in urgent production tasks such as iron smelting, deep plowing, and fertilizer delivery, leaving few people for cotton field harvesting and cotton transportation. After receiving the instructions from the Provincial Party Committee, the Huaxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party quickly broke the "labor shortage" theory, re-arranged the labor force in an all-round way, and immediately extracted more than 40,000 women, semi-laborers, and students to concentrate on picking cotton. They also extracted some stronger male full-time laborers to operate cotton gins, so that cotton purchasing and other tasks advanced simultaneously. The amount of cotton purchased quickly increased to more than 17,200 dan, becoming the county with the best completion of the purchase task in the province so far.

    依靠群众大购棉花
    石家庄专区一天购棉两亿斤
    陕西部分县打破“劳力紧张论”收购大跃进
    本报讯　石家庄专区商业部门在各级党委的统一领导下，充分发动群众依靠群众，掀起了热火朝天的摘棉、运棉、收棉高潮，在10月21日一天当中在风雨交加道路泥泞的情况下，全区收购籽棉二亿斤，比往年最高日收量增加三十倍。创历史最高纪录。截至21日共收购皮棉一亿八千五百五十万斤，完成了全年收棉计划的44.2％，其中束鹿栾城两县都已提前超额完成了全年收棉计划。
    党委挂帅是作好收棉工作的根本保证。为加强领导收摘棉花工作，石家庄专署曾在21日早晨召开电话会议，要求各县在抓钢铁和深翻土地的同时，掀起更大的收棉高潮，大干五昼夜，收棉五亿五千万斤，10月底保证完成收棉计划。当天各县、各人民公社和生产队的党委书记立即发动广大群众突击摘棉送棉。全区重新安排了劳动力，共组织了一百六十万人和各种大小车八万多辆摘送棉花。束鹿县在21日收购籽棉三千万斤。这个县张古庄红旗人民公社20日四个党委书记、五个主任、十一个部长率领着三万多人向距离三十五华里的辛集送棉一百七十万斤，还运送废铁二十万斤，拉回煤炭二百万斤，煤油四十二大桶。全专区各县预计10月底能保证完成全年的收棉任务。
    本报西安28日电　陕西省在当前收购棉花工作中出现了两种情况：一种是受“劳力紧张论”的思想束缚，收购进度迟迟不前；另一种是突破了“劳力紧张论”，扭转了收购进度缓慢的情况。今年陕西省棉花大丰收，但是直到10月初，田里还有白花遍地无人拾，拾回的一少部分也没人轧，截至本月15日，关中武功、郿县、扶风、乾县、耀县等产棉区，收购棉花只占收购任务的0.1％到0.85％。
    各产棉县的干部和群众认为当前劳力过于紧张，大部分劳力都投入炼钢铁、深翻地和秋收秋播等运动，抽不出人来拾花轧花。
    中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会在10月中旬召开全省电话会议，要求各地通过辩论，全面合理地安排劳力，突击抢收棉花和收购棉花等工作，华县共有八万个劳动力，这时已派出近八万个劳动力投入炼铁、深翻地和送粪等紧迫的生产任务，用于棉田收摘和棉花运送的就没有多少人了。中共华县委员会在接到省委指示后，很快打破“劳力紧张”论，重新全面安排了劳力，立刻抽出妇女半劳力和学生共四万多人突击收摘棉花，又抽出部分较强壮的男全劳力开动轧花机，使棉花收购工作和其他各项工作齐头并进。收购棉花的数量很快增加到一万七千二百多担，成为目前全省完成收购工作最好的一个县。
