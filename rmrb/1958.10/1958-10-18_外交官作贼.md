    Diplomat Turned Thief
    Tianma Poem, Yintao Drawing
    Reported: The U.S. Deputy Military Attaché at the Embassy in the Soviet Union stole someone's letter in Tbilisi... A dignified diplomatic official, disregarding all decency, brazenly stole someone's letter in public. The letter was military mail, delighting the pickpocket's heart, stealing it to seek credit and reward, such an opportunity is hard to come by. He was caught on the spot, the pickpocket at a loss, with both human and physical evidence, he had no choice but to admit his mistake with his head down. When asked to sign a statement, he shamelessly refused, using the excuse that he was good at finding loopholes: "Violates diplomatic norms." What fine "diplomatic norms," a diplomatic official acting as a thief, so-called American diplomacy: conspiracy, fraud, theft!

    外交官作贼
    天马诗　英韬画报载：美国驻苏大使馆副武官在第比利斯偷人信件……堂堂外交官员，不顾什么体面，大庭广众之中，竟然偷人信件。信件本是军邮，扒手喜在心头，偷去邀功请赏，这个机会难求。当场被人抓住，扒手手脚无措，人证物证俱在，只好低头认错。要他签字具结，老着脸皮拒绝，借口亏他会找：“违反外交惯例”。好个“外交惯例”，外交官员作贼，所谓美国外交：阴谋、诈骗、盗窃！
