Finding the "Seam"
    Shang Ye

    At present, the commercial sector must take advantage of the gaps in the two major movements of steel and agriculture, "seizing the opportunity," to quickly reverse the slow pace of purchasing agricultural and sideline products.

    However, some people now cannot see the "seam." All they see is an abnormal labor shortage, with not even a single gap. Since they cannot see the "seam," the "needle" cannot be inserted, so the purchase of agricultural and sideline products there is at a standstill; either no one is picking cotton, or after it is picked, no one is purchasing and transporting it. In the famous cotton-producing areas of Guanzhong, such as Wugong and Mei counties, by mid-October, less than 1% of the cotton purchasing task has been completed.

    Why can some people see the "seam," while others cannot? It turns out that the "seams" of labor, time, and transportation are not absolute. If you look for it, it will be there; if you don't look, it will be squeezed out by other things. Here, people's subjective initiative plays an important role. We often encounter such situations in our daily lives. Take work and study, for example. Everyone's work is very demanding, and sometimes it seems that there is no time to read at all. However, if you think learning is essential and rationally arrange your day, study time can be squeezed out. Those who emphasize difficulties in the purchasing work do not see people's subjective initiative, nor do they see the potential of the masses. Therefore, they neither see the "seam" nor want to find the "seam."

    What method should be used to find the "seam"? The fundamental way is to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and arrange the labor force properly. Today's news in this newspaper about the "satellite" launched by the Shijiazhuang Special Zone in Hebei Province in purchasing work powerfully refutes the "labor shortage theory." Does the Shijiazhuang Special Zone not vigorously develop steel and deeply plow the land? Is their labor force and transportation capacity not tight? However, they organized 1.6 million people and 80,000 vehicles in just one day, purchasing thirty times the highest daily volume of cotton in previous years.

    Cotton, as well as other agricultural and sideline products that the state needs to purchase, will always have to be purchased. If they are not purchased now, they will have to be purchased in the future. The labor and transportation needed for purchasing will always be used; if they are not used now, they will have to be used in the future. The difference is that by adopting the method of "seizing the opportunity" to purchase, it can be purchased in a timely manner, can support the urgent needs of all aspects, and will promote the smooth sale of means of production and consumer goods. However, if the matter is delayed, it is likely to bring losses to the national economy and create passivity in all aspects of work, and ultimately, the problem will still have to be solved.

    At present, party organizations and commercial departments in all regions, without exception, need to rely on and mobilize the masses like the Shijiazhuang Special Zone, and do everything possible to find the "seams" of labor, time, and transportation, and quickly insert the "needle" of agricultural and sideline products purchase and transport. This is an urgent task.

    找“缝”
    尚叶
    在当前，商业部门必须利用钢铁和农业两大运动的空隙，“见缝插针”，才能迅速扭转农副产品收购迟缓的局面。
    但是，现在有些人却看不见“缝”，他们看见的只是劳动力异常紧张，连一点空隙也没有。既然看不见“缝”，“针”当然也就无法插上去，因而那里的农副产品收购工作是处于停滞状态；棉花不是没人收摘，就是收摘了没人收购和调运。著名的关中产棉区武功、郿县等五个县，截至10月中旬，已经收购起来的棉花还不到收购任务的1％。
    为什么有的人看得见“缝”，有的人却看不见“缝”呢？原来，劳动力、时间、运输力的“缝”，不是绝对的。你要找它，就有；不去找，就会被别的事情挤掉了。这里，人的主观能动性起着重要的作用。我们日常生活中也常常遇到这样的情况。拿工作和学习来说，大家工作都很紧张，有时看来根本没有时间读书。但是，如果你认为学习是必不可少的，把一天的生活合理地安排一下，学习时间也就挤出来了。在收购工作上强调困难的，看不见人的主观能动性、看不见群众的潜力，因而他们既看不见“缝”，也不想去找“缝”。
    用什么办法去找“缝”呢？根本的办法是依靠群众、发动群众，安排好劳动力。今天本报发表的河北省石家庄专区收购工作放“卫星”的消息，就有力地驳倒了“劳动力紧张论”者。石家庄专区难道不大搞钢铁、不深翻土地吗？他们的劳动力、运输力难道不紧张吗？但是，他们仅仅在一天当中，就组织起一百六十万人和八万辆车，收购了三十倍于往年最高日收量的棉花。
    棉花，还有国家需要收购的其他农副产品，总是要收购起来的，现在不收购将来也要收购。为收购所需要的劳动力和运输力也总是要用的，现在不用将来也要用。所不同的是：采取“见缝插针”的办法来收购，就可以收购得及时，可以支援各方面的迫切需要，而且会促进生产资料和消费资料的畅销。而如果拖延时日，就很可能给国民经济带来损失，给各方面的工作造成被动，而最终，问题还是要解决。
    在目前，各地党组织和商业部门，无例外地，都需要像石家庄专区那样，依靠和发动群众，想尽一切办法，找出劳动力、时间和运输力的“缝”来，把农副产品收购和调运这根“针”迅速插上去。这是一项迫不及待的任务。
