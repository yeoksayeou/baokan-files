This newspaper reports: The Ministry of Agriculture convened the Fifth National Rice Transplanter Conference in Nanjing in early September. After field trials, evaluations, and appraisals of forty rice transplanters submitted from various regions, five rice transplanters were selected for nationwide promotion. This marks a new stage in China's history of creating rice transplanters, moving from the experimental stage to a new stage of mass manufacturing and comprehensive application.

China began creating and trial-producing rice transplanters in 1952. In recent years, especially with the comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the work of creating and researching rice transplanters has made remarkable progress. At the Fourth National Rice Transplanter Conference held last October, only eight rice transplanters were submitted from various regions, and only four were actually capable of transplanting rice in the fields. During this conference, forty models were submitted, and over 90% could transplant rice. Even the rice transplanters with average transplanting quality have caught up with the best rice transplanters from last year. According to incomplete statistics from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other fourteen provinces and cities represented at the conference, 689 types of rice transplanters have been created, and 3,020 units have been promoted. The conference believes that these brilliant achievements are the result of adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, following the mass line, and mobilizing the broad masses of workers and peasants to work hard; at the same time, it is the result of breaking down mystical viewpoints, emancipating the mind, and establishing a daring and innovative communist style, thus making the research and creation of rice transplanters a mass activity.

During the conference, field trials were conducted on the rice transplanters submitted from various regions. In accordance with the principles and standards of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Liling County Simple Rice Transplanter from Hunan, the Red Flag No. 1 from Jiangxi, the Nan-105 from the Nanjing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, the Innovation Model from Zhuji, Zhejiang, and the Direct Planting Type from Yuyao, Zhejiang, were selected for nationwide promotion. The general characteristics of these rice transplanters are: 1. High transplanting efficiency, generally increasing efficiency by more than six times compared to manual transplanting, with some increasing it by about twenty times. 2. Good transplanting quality, with very few injured or floating seedlings. 3. Easy to obtain materials, simple structure, convenient manufacturing, low cost, and simple operation. 4. Suitable for dense planting. Generally, each mu can plant more than 50,000 holes, and some can reach about 300,000 holes per mu. 5. Applicable to various different regions (such as mountainous areas, hills, and plains).

The delegates unanimously agreed that, based on the advantages of the five selected rice transplanters, the conditions for widespread promotion of large-scale mechanized transplanting are already mature. The conference demanded that manual rice transplanting be basically eliminated next year, achieving semi-mechanization of rice transplanting. This is of great significance for liberating the labor force and promoting a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year.

In order to create a vigorous upsurge in the manufacturing, promotion, and application of rice transplanters, it is necessary to make full preparations in terms of materials and technology from now on. A large number should be manufactured and promoted before the autumn harvest this year, and technical teams should be organized to widely publicize and impart operating techniques in various forms, passing the technology on to the members of the people's communes and agricultural cooperatives. The conference believes that, in accordance with the spirit of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the principle of combining lower and higher levels, combining simple and complex methods, and combining popularization and improvement should be adopted in the promotion. For rice transplanters manufactured in various regions with good transplanting quality, high efficiency, and simple manufacturing, comprehensive promotion should be carried out now. For those with good transplanting quality, high efficiency, but relatively complex manufacturing, they should be vigorously recommended now, and regions with the conditions should also actively promote them. The delegates also pointed out that the rice transplanters selected at this conference must continue to summarize experience, improve them, and continuously improve quality in the process of use, so as to make them more perfect.

Nan-105 Rice Transplanter

The "Nan-105" rice transplanter uses a comb-chisel longitudinal pulling seedling dividing method to divide seedlings. It can adapt to the transplanting work of early, middle, and late season seedlings.

The machine is operated by two people, with a working width of 1.2 meters. The pulling resistance is 50 to 60 kg. It is suitable for manual, animal, small tractor, and rope traction machines. The working quality is not affected by the speed of forward movement. It can transplant 20 to 25 mu per day.

Yuyao Direct Planting Rice Transplanter

It is 150 cm long, 80 cm wide, and 90 cm high. Iron and wood structure (mainly wood), weighing 50.5 kg, and costing about 60 yuan. The row and plant spacing is 2 x 2 inches. It is operated by two people, one pulling and one transplanting. It transplants more than 2 mu per day, increasing efficiency by 5 to 6 times compared to manual transplanting.

    水稻插秧明年半机械化
    水稻插秧机会议评选出五台插秧机向全国推广
    本报讯　农业部9月初在南京召开了全国第五次水稻插秧机会议，对各地选送的四十台插秧机经过田间试验、评比和鉴定，评选出五台插秧机向全国推广。这标志着我国创造水稻插秧机的历史，已经从试验阶段步入到大量制造、全面推广使用的新阶段。
    我国创造试制水稻插秧机是在1952年。几年来，特别是随着工农业生产全面跃进，水稻插秧机的创造研究工作有突飞猛进。在去年10月举行的全国第四次水稻插秧机会议上，各地选送的插秧机只有八台，而真正能够下田插秧的仅有四台。在这次会议期间，送到了四十种型号，90％以上都能插秧。其中属于插秧质量一般的也已赶上去年质量最好的插秧机。据到会的浙江、江苏等十四个省市不完全统计，已经创造的插秧机有六百八十九种，推广了三千零二十台。会议认为取得这些辉煌成就，是由于采取了政治挂帅，走群众路线，发动广大工农群众大干特干的结果；同时是破除了神秘观点，解放了思想，树立了敢想敢作的共产主义风格，因而使插秧机的研究创造发展成为群众活动。
    会议期间各地选送的插秧机都进行了田间试验。按照多快好省的原则和标准，评选出湖南醴陵县简易插秧机、江西红旗一号、南京农业机械化研究所南—105、浙江诸暨革新号和该省余姚直插式等五台插秧机向全国推广。这些插秧机的一般特点是：一、插秧效率高，一般都比人插提高工效六倍以上，有的提高到二十倍左右。二、插秧质量好，伤秧、漂秧很少。三、取材容易，结构简单，制造方便，造价便宜，操作简单。四、适于密植。一般每亩能插五万穴以上，多的可以达到每亩三十万穴左右。五、适用于各种不同地区（如山区、丘陵、平原）。
    到会代表一致认为从已评选出的五种插秧机所具有的优点来看，普遍推广大面积机插的条件业已成熟。会议要求明年要做到基本上取消用手插秧，做到水稻插秧半机械化。这样对于解放劳动力和促进明年农业生产更大跃进有重要意义。
    为了掀起一个轰轰烈烈的制造、推广和使用水稻插秧机的热潮，从现在起要在物质上技术上作好充分准备。今年秋收前大量制造一批，推广一批，并组织一批技术队伍，采取多种多样形式，广泛宣传和传授操作技术，把技术交给人民公社、农业社的社员。会议认为根据多快好省的精神，在推广中应当采取低级与高级相结合，简单与复杂相结合，普及与提高相结合的方针。对于各地制造的插秧质量好、效率高、制造简单的插秧机，现在就全面推广。对于那些插秧质量好、效率高，但制造比较复杂的，现在就大力推荐，有条件的地区也应积极推广。代表们还指出，这次会上评选出的插秧机，还必须在使用的过程中不断总结经验，加以改进，不断提高质量，使之更加完善。
