After several years of practice, it has been proven that "supply system - wage system - supply system" is by no means an objective law or a spiral-like ascent, but rather a detour we took due to a lack of experience. Does saying this mean we lack a historical materialist viewpoint? No. We believe that the wage system negating the supply system after 1953, and now the supply system negating the wage system, is a gradual process of people's understanding of the truth. When we began socialist construction, due to a lack of experience, there was a tendency to exaggerate and attack the shortcomings of the supply system, and the "graded wage system" was excessively idealized. This prompted the change from the long-standing and effective supply system to the wage system. However, after several years of practical testing, especially after the rectification campaign, the liberation of thought, and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, people began to recognize the shortcomings of the wage system and reaffirmed the benefits of the supply system. Practice, understanding, and reaffirming the correct things of the past are completely in line with the laws of recognizing things.

    改工资制是走了弯路
    高朔
    经过几年的实践证明，“供给制——工资制——供给制”这决不是什么客观规律和螺旋式的上升，而是由于我们缺乏经验而走了一段弯路。这样说，是不是就没有历史唯物主义观点呢？不是的。我们认为1953年以后工资制否定供给制，现在又由供给制来否定工资制，是人们对真理的逐渐认识过程。当开始实行社会主义建设的时候，由于没有经验，一时出现了夸大和攻击供给制的缺点的倾向，而把“等级工资制”过分理想化了。这样促使曾经久已行之有效的供给制改为工资制。但是，经过几年的实践检验的结果，特别是经过了整风，解放了思想，工农业生产大跃进，人们开始认识到工资制的缺点，而重新肯定了供给制的好处。实践、认识，重新肯定了过去正确的东西，这是完全符合认识事物的规律的。
