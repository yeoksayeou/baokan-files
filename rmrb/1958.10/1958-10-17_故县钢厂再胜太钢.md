This Dispatch from our Changzhi Correspondent on the 16th: The Guxian Steel Plant in Changzhi, Shanxi Province, after exceeding the steel production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company on September 30th, again surpassed Taiyuan Iron and Steel's highest daily output of more than 1,800 tons of steel, created on October 11th, with a new record of 2,150 tons of steel on October 14th. In this communist friendship competition, the average daily output of Guxian Steel Plant from October 1st to 14th also greatly increased compared to the same period last month.

The Guxian Steel Plant is a small-scale iron and steel complex. Due to their active exploration of the potential of existing equipment and the serious development of the "small indigenous groups" steelmaking and ironmaking movement, on September 30th, they exceeded the daily output of Taiyuan Iron and Steel’s 732 tons on the same day with a production of 1,162 tons. Immediately afterwards, all employees of the plant launched a great airing of views, great debate on catching up with and surpassing Taiyuan Iron and Steel in average daily output. In recent days, they have continued to vigorously promote "small indigenous groups," with small converters, indigenous open-hearth furnaces, and channel steel furnaces increasing from more than 120 to more than 200. The rolling mill workshop created an advanced method of hot patching furnace linings, extending the life of the furnace, and increasing the steel output per furnace from 1.2 tons to 2.5 tons. In order to produce more and better steel, a red flag competition was launched between all units in the plant and between furnaces, and work was also carried out to expand furnace capacity, improve air ducts, and recycle large amounts of scrap steel.

    故县钢厂再胜太钢
    本报长治16日电　山西省长治故县钢铁厂继上月30日超过太原钢铁公司的钢产量之后，10月14日又以日产二千一百五十吨钢的新纪录，超过了太钢11日创造的一千八百多吨钢的最高日产量。在这场共产主义的友谊竞赛中，故县钢铁厂10月1日至14日的平均日产量，也比上月同期大为提高。
    故县钢铁厂是一个小型钢铁联合企业。他们由于积极挖掘现有设备的潜力，认真开展“小土群”炼钢炼铁运动，在9月30日，曾以日产一千一百六十二吨的成绩，超过了同一天太钢产钢七百三十二吨的日产量。紧接着，全厂职工开展了平均日产量赶太钢超太钢的大鸣大放大辩论。连日来，他们继续大搞“小土群”，小转炉、土平炉、槽钢炉由一百二十多个增加到二百多个。轧钢车间创造了热补炉层的先进方法，延长了炉的寿命，并且使每炉的钢产量由一点二吨增加到二点五吨。为了多出钢出好钢，全厂各个单位之间、炉与炉之间开展了红旗竞赛，还进行了扩大炉的容量，改进风道和大量回收废钢铁等工作。
