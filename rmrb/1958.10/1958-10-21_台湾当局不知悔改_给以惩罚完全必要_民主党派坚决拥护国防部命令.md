Xinhua News Agency, October 20th. Members of the Central Committee and heads of various departments of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Beijing gathered this afternoon, unanimously supporting the Ministry of National Defense's order to resume shelling of Jinmen. Shao Lizi, Chen Shaoxian, Zhu Yunshan, Liu Fei, Qian Changzhao, Hou Jingru, and others spoke at the meeting.

In their speeches, everyone unanimously condemned the Taiwan authorities for openly violating our conditions for suspending the shelling and for introducing the crime of US military escort. They felt extremely angry at the Taiwan authorities' stubborn refusal to accept peace talks, their intensified collusion with US imperialism, their stepped-up war preparations, and their clamoring for a counterattack on the mainland. It was considered that, under these circumstances, our army's resumption of shelling to show punishment was completely timely and necessary.

In their speeches, everyone also pointed out that Dulles' visit to Taiwan harbored great conspiracies and misfortunes, and peace-loving countries and people around the world must pay serious attention and vigilance. Everyone stated that the Chinese people's position on liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu is firm and unwavering. This is China's internal affair, and no US interference is absolutely allowed. We must strengthen the struggle against US aggression and shatter all its conspiracies and tricks.

Everyone emphasized that the Chinese people of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are mostly patriotic, and only a very small number persist in reactionary positions. It is hoped that this very small number of people can recognize the current situation and return from their misguided path.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th. Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued a statement today, resolutely advocating punitive strikes against the Chiang Kai-shek group, which insists on its stubborn policy, and warning that the US military must immediately get out of Taiwan.

Shen Junru said that the Taiwan authorities insist on their stubborn attitude, intensify war preparations, clamor for a counterattack on the mainland, collude with Dulles to further implement the so-called US-Chiang "treaty," and even bring in US warships for escort. The people of the whole country can no longer tolerate this situation, and shelling must be resumed immediately to give punishment.

Shen Junru said that in the orders issued by the Ministry of National Defense several times, it has been repeatedly emphasized that we must recognize the national righteousness and distinguish clearly between China and the United States. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are all Chinese territory. Whether we fight or make peace with the Taiwan authorities is entirely our internal affair and has nothing to do with the Americans. US military escorts in the Jinmen sea area and Dulles' conspiracy activities in Taiwan are interference in China's internal affairs and infringement upon China's territory and sovereignty, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. Recovering Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu is the sacred task of the Chinese people. The shameless Americans who are赖 (lai- hang around, refuse to leave) in Taiwan must go back. If they don't go back themselves, the entire Chinese people, including the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, will bury them in the strait.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th. The person in charge of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a statement on the Ministry of National Defense's order to resume shelling of Jinmen, as follows:

All members of our China Democratic National Construction Association and the industrial and commercial masses connected with them firmly support the Ministry of National Defense's order to resume shelling of Jinmen. Since October 6th, our army has suspended shelling of Jinmen for humanitarian reasons, but on the condition that there is no US escort. However, the Taiwan authorities actually introduced US military escort, so our army's resumption of shelling is absolutely necessary.

Our country's recovery of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu is China's internal affair, and no US interference is absolutely allowed. US Secretary of State Dulles' visit to Taiwan this time to plan the further implementation of the US-Chiang "treaty" shows that the United States still wants to賴 (lai- hang around, refuse to leave) in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait to endanger peace in the Far East and the world. In order to defend the integrity of our territory and sovereignty and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, our people absolutely cannot tolerate this rampant act of aggression by the United States. The US government must abandon its policy of aggression and war, and the US military must get out of the Taiwan Strait area.

We want to solemnly warn the Taiwan authorities that the affairs of the Chinese should be resolved by the Chinese themselves; problems between the Chinese can always be resolved through peaceful negotiations. No US interference is allowed. We hope you will not be obsessed and fail to see the truth. Of the thirty-six strategies, peace is the best strategy. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu must return to the embrace of the great motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, October 20th. A spokesperson for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement today, saying: The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League firmly supports the order to resume shelling issued by our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai.

The spokesperson also said: Our People's Liberation Army has twice stopped shelling for humanitarianism and national righteousness, and suggested holding peace talks. However, the Taiwan authorities not only have no repentance and continue to adhere to their stubborn attitude; but also clamor for a "counterattack on the mainland" and even introduce US military escort, openly violating our army's conditions for suspending shelling. Therefore, giving punishment is absolutely necessary.

US warships invading our country's territorial waters in the Xiamen and Jinmen areas to escort the Taiwan Kuomintang army is an extremely serious provocative incident after our announcement that Americans are not allowed to escort. We resolutely oppose the US robbers using the Taiwan authorities to carry out any acts of infringing upon our country's sovereignty. The US aggressors who continue to賴 (lai- hang around, refuse to leave) in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait will surely be hanged in these places.

"Of the thirty-six strategies, peace is the best strategy." We expect the Taiwan authorities to be clear about national righteousness, quickly rein in at the brink of the precipice, and not embark on a dead end.

    台湾当局不知悔改
    给以惩罚完全必要
    民主党派坚决拥护国防部命令
    新华社20日讯　中国国民党革命委员会在京中央委员和各部门负责人今天下午集会，一致拥护国防部恢复炮击金门的命令。在会上发言的有邵力子、陈劭先、朱蕴山、刘斐、钱昌照、侯镜如等。
    大家在发言中一致指责台湾当局公然违反我们暂停炮击的条件，引进美军护航的罪行；对于台湾当局执迷不悟，拒绝接受和谈，并变本加厉地与美帝国主义相勾结，加紧战争准备，叫嚣反攻大陆，尤其感到极大的愤怒。认为在此情况下，我军恢复炮击，以示惩罚，完全是适时的和必要的。
    在发言中，大家还指出杜勒斯到台湾是包藏着极大的阴谋和祸心的，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民必须予以严重的注意和警惕。大家表示，中国人民解放台、澎、金、马的立场是坚定不移的，这是中国的内政，绝对不容许美国干涉，我们一定要加强反对美国侵略的斗争，粉碎它的一切阴谋诡计。
    大家着重指出，台、澎、金、马的中国人，爱国的是多数，坚持反动立场的是极少数，希望这极少数的人能够认清时局，迷途知返。
    新华社20日讯　中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒今天发表谈话，坚决主张给坚持顽固政策的蒋介石集团以惩罚性打击，警告美国军队必须立刻从台湾滚出去。
    沈钧儒说，台湾当局坚持顽固态度，加紧战争准备，叫嚣反攻大陆，同杜勒斯策划进一步实施所谓美蒋“条约”，竟然把美国军舰引来护航，全国人民对这种情况实在是忍无可忍，必须立即恢复炮击，给予惩罚。
    沈钧儒说，在国防部几次发出的命令中，一再提出要认清民族大义，必须把中美界限分得清清楚楚。台、澎、金、马都是中国的领土，我们和台湾当局打也好，和也好，全是我们中国内部的事情，与美国人毫不相干。美军在金门海域护航，杜勒斯到台湾进行阴谋活动，这就是干涉中国内政，就是侵犯中国的领土和主权，我们是绝对不能容忍的。收复台、澎、金、马是中国人民的神圣任务，厚颜无耻赖在台湾的美国人必须滚回去，如果他们自己不滚回去，我们全中国人民包括台、澎、金、马的爱国军民在内，一定会把他们埋葬在海峡里。
    新华社20日讯　中国民主建国会中央常务委员会负责人就国防部发布恢复炮击金门的命令一事发表谈话如下：
    我们中国民主建国会全体成员及其有联系的工商界群众坚决拥护国防部发布的对金门恢复炮击的命令。从10月6日起，我军暂停炮击金门，是为了人道主义，但以没有美国人护航为条件。可是台湾当局竟引进美军护航，所以我军恢复炮击，这是完全必要的。
    我国收复台、澎、金、马是中国的内政，绝不容许美国人干涉。美国国务卿杜勒斯这次到台湾策划进一步实施美蒋“条约”，可见美国还要死赖在台湾和台湾海峡，以危害远东和世界和平。我国人民为了保卫领土和主权的完整，保卫远东和世界的和平，绝不能容忍美国这种猖獗的侵略行为，美国政府必须放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策，美国军队必须从台湾海峡地区滚回去。
    我们要正告台湾当局，中国人的事应该由中国人自己解决；中国人之间的问题，总可以通过和平谈判的方法来解决的，不允许美国人插手干涉，希望你们不要执迷不悟，三十六计，和为上计，台澎金马是一定要回到伟大的祖国怀抱的。
    新华社20日讯　台湾民主自治同盟发言人今天发表谈话说：台湾民主自治同盟坚决拥护我国部防长彭德怀发出的恢复炮击的命令。
    发言人还说：我人民解放军为了人道主义和民族大义，曾两次停止炮击，建议举行和谈。但是，台湾当局不仅毫无悔悟，继续坚持顽固态度；而且大肆叫嚣“反攻大陆”，竟引进美军护航，公然违反我军暂停炮击的条件。因此，给予惩罚是完全必要的。
    美国军舰侵入我国厦门、金门地区的领海，为台湾国民党军队护航，这是我国宣布美国人不得护航之后的极其严重的挑衅事件。我们坚决反对美国强盗利用台湾当局进行任何侵犯我国主权的勾当。美国侵略者继续赖在台湾和台湾海峡，必将被绞死在这些地方。
    “三十六计，和为上计”。我们期望台湾当局明于民族大义，赶快悬崖勒马，不要走上绝路。
