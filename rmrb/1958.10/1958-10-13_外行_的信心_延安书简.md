    The Confidence of the "Layman"
    ——Letters from Yan'an
    Yan Ling
    In Yan'an, I saw many cadres like this: When our motherland, our society, our era needed them to change their steeds, at a single command, they would immediately jump from the horse they were familiar with to another horse they were not familiar with. We can't say they were not attached to the horse they had raised and were used to riding, nor can we say they were unaware of the difficulties of taming a new horse. However, you couldn't see any hesitation in them, and you couldn't hear them say, "I'm not familiar with it" or "It doesn't suit my interests." In these ordinary cadres of the Party and the people, you could see how courage, perseverance, awareness, and discipline were harmoniously intertwined.

    In the courtyard of the Yan'an County Party Committee, there were two nursery plots. The small poplar branches planted in the spring had already taken root and grown into small trees several feet tall. The walnuts planted had also turned into walnut trees, growing vigorously. This was the experimental nursery of the comrades of the County Communist Youth League Committee. They didn't know how to plant trees in the past. When the task of greening the motherland and greening Yan'an came, they tried every means to master the knowledge of planting trees. Not long ago, Comrade Diao Sijing, the secretary of the County Communist Youth League Committee, was still enthusiastically and carefully tending these seedlings with everyone, mastering the science of afforestation. When the task of developing local industry came, the Party Committee decided to transfer him to the industrial front. Soon, he became the director of an iron smelting plant, leading the construction of the first mechanized blast furnace in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region.

    In Panlong District, there was a cadre most beloved by the masses, Comrade Wang Qishi, the former deputy district chief. The first time I saw him, he was working with the masses on a water conservancy construction site. In the past, he was an "old peasant" and also a "layman" when it came to water conservancy projects. In the mass movement to build water conservancy projects over the past few months, he mastered a complete set of knowledge from surveying to construction, and summarized many experiences. Developing the iron smelting industry required a large amount of coal; soon, he was transferred to be the director of a coal mine. He was going to a new job the next day, and on the first day he ran a long way to check a new canal. As soon as he arrived at his new post, he worked hard with the masses, and soon he gradually became an expert in the basic construction and production of coal mines.

    Comrade Luo Youbiao, the original secretary of the Panlong District Party Committee, had never even seen what a factory looked like; however, a phone call came, asking him to be the director of a cement plant with an annual output of more than 30,000 tons that was about to be built. He handed over his work, drank a few farewell cups of wine with the comrades he had worked with, and left with his luggage.

    "The Party tells me to do what, I'll do what!" Do it when you say it, forge ahead! Many good comrades are like this.

    I attended a meeting convened by the County Party Committee to discuss industrial issues. The meeting place was on the Mao'ergou mountain where Yan'an's first oil refinery was being built, at the entrance of a cave dwelling.

    The participants in the meeting were: Liu Fenggong, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, Bai Zhizhong, the director of the County Party Committee's Industry Department, Chang Weishun, the chief of the County People's Committee's Industry and Transportation Section, Dang Jiangcheng, the first secretary of the Panlong Township Party Committee and the Gongnong People's Commune Party Committee, and Wang Zhiwen, the director of the oil refinery. It can be said that none of the participants in this industrial meeting were industrial experts. Comrade Liu Fenggong was the director of the Prefectural Committee's Rural Work Department a few months ago, and before that, he was a revolutionary soldier. Comrade Bai Zhizhong was the deputy director of the County Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department not long ago. Comrade Chang Weishun used to be the district chief of Ganguyi District. Comrade Wang Zhiwen was the secretary of the Liulin District Party Committee a month or two ago. In the past, they could be said to be old hands at planting crops, but they were either completely ignorant of industry or had just started to touch it. It was precisely these people who were going to lead the masses in vigorously developing industry, to open up new battlefields and achieve new victories in the march towards nature. They believed that as long as there were minerals and people, they would definitely be able to produce iron and oil!

    When they talked about the mineral deposits in various parts of Yan'an, especially in the Panlong area, they were so excited and so familiar! Comrades Chang Weishun and Dang Jiangcheng laid out the distribution areas of coal mines, iron mines, and oil shale, and also talked about their quantity and quality, as if they were enumerating their family treasures.

    They calculated in detail and accurately: how many bricks, how many cubic meters of stone, how much sand, how much lime, how much cement were needed; how heavy a cubic meter of stone was, how heavy a brick was; how much could a large cart pull at a time, how much could a small cart carry at a time; how much could a large furnace produce per month, how much could a small furnace produce per month; how much labor force was needed for agriculture and water conservancy, how much labor force was needed for iron smelting, oil refining, and coal mining…

    They estimated the various difficulties that might arise and found out strategies to conquer the difficulties.

    "Can't we design a mineral crushing machine based on the model of a ramming machine? Why must coal be carried by people in the mine? Can't we lay wooden rails and use 'native trains' to transport it?" Comrade Liu Fenggong quickly put forward several suggestions for improving tools.

    Is there a shortage of refractory bricks? Why buy them from far away? We can make them ourselves. The Yan'an Xinhua Ceramics Factory and the Panlong Porcelain Kiln have already fired refractory bricks. Not enough? White sand can replace bricks; porcelain clay, crock powder, clay plus coke powder can replace it, these things are everywhere in Yan'an…

    The information that each person knew was concentrated at the meeting. The industrial knowledge that each person had just learned was exchanged at the meeting. This made everyone more clear-headed and more powerful.

    Difficult? Yes. But wasn't it difficult during the period of opening up the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia base area? Wasn't it difficult during the Anti-Japanese War? Wasn't it difficult during the Liberation War?

    On the way back from Mao'ergou, Comrade Liu Fenggong excitedly talked to us a lot. Passing by Liujiaping, he said that it was the place where he lived when he first joined the revolutionary army in 1935. It was there that he learned many revolutionary truths from the old Red Army soldiers and learned many fighting songs. However, he really learned how to fight, how to be brave and resourceful, after participating in the first battle. Before participating in the battle, I always felt that fighting was very mysterious, and it was inevitable that I would feel a little scared. Once the fighting started, courage and skills suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

    Comrade Liu Fenggong's leg was slightly lame. This was because he was injured on the edge of a cliff during a night march when he was on the Long March. Walking was naturally a little difficult. However, this time he walked more than a hundred miles from Yan'an to get here. It was to see the crops, the waterways, the springs, the factories, and the minerals along the way… He often left the main road and walked in deep mountain valleys, walked on mountain slopes without roads… When he went to see a canal diverting mountain springs, he told me that he wanted to launch a "Ten Thousand Springs Movement" throughout the county - digging more than ten thousand mountain springs. Even small springs that can only irrigate a few acres of land must be utilized.

    Now, on the industrial front, people have the feeling of "fighting the first battle" again. People who can learn to fight will definitely be able to learn how to run industries. A "Ten Thousand Springs Movement" will definitely appear in Yan'an in industry; we will definitely see a torrent of iron and oil flowing here soon!

    “外行”的信心
    ——延安书简
    燕凌
    在延安，我看到许多这样的干部：当我们的祖国、我们的社会、我们的时代需要他们变换自己的鞍骑的时候，一声令下，他们就立即从自己熟悉了的马背上跳到他们不熟悉的另一匹马上去。不能说他们对于自己过去养熟了骑惯了的马不依恋，也不能说他们对于驯服新马的困难毫不在意。可是，看不到他们有什么犹豫，听不到他们说什么“我不熟悉”“兴趣不合”。在党和人民的这些平平常常的干部身上，可以看到勇气、毅力、觉悟、纪律是怎样和谐地交织在一起。
    在延安县委的大院子里，有两片苗圃。春天插下的杨树的小枝条，都已经扎了根，长成了几尺高的小树。种下的核桃，也变成了核桃树，旺盛地成长着。——这是共青团县团委的同志们的试验苗圃。他们过去并不懂得种树。绿化祖国、绿化延安的任务来了，他们就想一切办法掌握种树的知识。不久以前，县团委书记刁思敬同志还在兴致勃勃而又小心翼翼地同大家一起在伺弄这些树苗、掌握造林科学。发展地方工业的任务来了，党委决定抽调他到工业战线上去。很快，他就做了冶铁厂的厂长，领导着建设陕北地区的第一个机械化的高炉。
    蟠龙区有一个最受群众爱戴的干部，就是原来的副区长王起世同志。我第一次见到他的时候，他正在水利工地上同群众一起劳动。过去，他是个“老农”，对于水利工程也是“外行”。在几个月的兴修水利的群众运动中，他就掌握了从勘测到施工的一整套知识，总结了许多经验。发展炼铁工业需要大量的煤炭；不久，他被调去做了煤矿矿长。第二天就要到新的工作岗位上去了，头一天他还跑了很远的路去查看一条新的水渠。一到新的岗位上，就同群众一起紧张地劳动，没多久，他对于煤矿的基本建设和生产又渐渐成了内行。
    原来的蟠龙区委书记罗有彪同志，还没有看到过工厂是什么样子；可是，一个电话打来，要调他去做一个不久就要动工兴建的年产三万多吨水泥的水泥厂厂长。他交代了工作，同原来一起工作的同志们喝上几杯告别的酒，扛起行李就走了。
    “党叫干啥，我就干啥！”说干就干，勇往直前！——这样的好同志，多得很。
    我参加过县委召开的一次讨论工业问题的会议。会议地点，就在正在建设延安的第一个炼油厂的毛儿沟的山上，在一个土窑洞门口。
    参加会议的人是：县委第一书记刘丰功、县委工业部部长白志中、县人委工交科科长常维顺、蟠龙乡党委和工农人民公社党委第一书记党将成、炼油厂厂长王志文。这个工业会议的参加者，可以说没有一个是工业专家。刘丰功同志几个月以前还是地委农村工作部部长，再以前是个革命军人。白志中同志不久以前是县委财贸部副部长。常维顺同志以前是甘谷驿区区长。王志文同志一两个月以前还是柳林区区委书记。过去，他们对于种庄稼倒可以说是老手，对工业是不摸边或者刚刚挨边。就正是这些人，要领导群众大办工业，要在向大自然进军中开辟新的战场，取得新的胜利。他们相信：有矿，有人，就一定能出铁，出油！
    谈起来延安各地、特别是蟠龙地区的矿藏来，他们是多么兴奋又多么熟悉！常维顺同志和党将成同志把煤矿、铁矿、油页岩的分布地区摆了一下，还谈了它们的数量和质量，真是如数家珍。
    他们详细地准确地计算了：需要多少砖，多少方石头，多少砂子，多少石灰，多少水泥；一方石头有多重，一块砖有多重；一个大车一次能拉多少，一个小车一次能载多重；大炉每月能产多少，小炉每月能产多少；农业、水利各需要多少劳动力，炼铁、炼油、采煤各需要多少劳动力……
    他们估计了可能发生的各种困难，找出了征服困难的计策。
      “仿照打夯机的样子，不可以设计一个矿石粉碎机吗？矿上运煤为什么非用人抬不行，不可以铺上木轨用‘土火车’运吗？”刘丰功同志很快就提出了好几件改进工具的建议。
    缺少耐火砖吗？何必到很远的地方去买，自己可以造。延安新华陶瓷厂和蟠龙瓷窑都已经烧出来了耐火砖。还不够用吗？白沙石可以代替砖；瓷土、缸片粉、胶泥加焦炭粉可以代替它，这些东西在延安到处都有……
    各个人了解的情况，在会议上集中了起来。各个人刚学到的工业知识，在会议上交流了起来。这就使每个人都更清醒也更有力量了。
    困难吗？有的。可是，开创陕北根据地时期不困难吗？抗日战争时期不困难吗？解放战争时期不困难吗？
    在从毛儿沟回来的路上，刘丰功同志兴奋地同我们谈了很多。路过刘家坪，他说，那是1935年他刚参加革命军队的时候住过的地方。他就是在那里向老红军学到了许多革命的道理，学会了许多战斗的歌曲。可是，真正学会打仗，学会勇敢和机智，还是在参加了第一次战斗之后。参加战斗之前，总觉得打仗很神秘，也难免有点恐惧心理。一打响，勇气和本领不知道怎么就突然出来了。
    刘丰功同志的腿稍微有些跛。这是当年西征的时候夜行军中在崖边摔伤的。走路自然有些困难。可是，这次他是从延安步行一百多里到这里来的。为的是沿途看庄稼，看水路，看泉源，看工厂，看矿石……时常离开大路，走在深山沟里，走在没有路的山坡上……在去看一条引山泉的水渠的时候，他告诉我：要在全县开展一个“万泉运动”——挖掘一万多个山泉。哪怕只能浇几分地的小泉，也要利用起来。
    现在，在工业战线上，人们又有了“第一次打仗”的心情。能学会打仗的人也一定能学会办工业。延安在工业上一定也会出现一个“万泉运动”；我们不久以后一定会在这里看到铁水和石油万泉奔流！
