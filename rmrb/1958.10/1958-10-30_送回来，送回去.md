    Sent Back, Sent Again
    Song Gang, Volunteer Soldier
    Today's holiday was like any other, spent helping the Anpingli Agricultural Cooperative repair its irrigation canals. In the evening, as we finished work and returned to camp, passing by the medical company's station, we suddenly saw a group of officers and soldiers gathered there in disarray, everyone chattering away! "Where did the chicken run off to? Have you forgotten your duty as duty officer?" In the middle of the crowd, a soldier wearing a duty officer armband stood there ashamed, listening to everyone's accusations, as if he had committed some terrible mistake.
    "What's going on? What does the duty officer have to do with a chicken?" For a moment, we couldn't make head or tail of it. Just then, a group of Korean children came running, surrounding an Ahjumma who was carrying two chickens. The comrades from the medical company immediately went to greet her, happily taking the chickens and gesturing as they spoke. Those who knew what was happening all laughed.
    As they were saying goodbye, another group of children came chasing after a flock of sheep, shouting "依哩哇啦". Everyone quickly spread out in a line, blocking the sheep's path. When the sheep saw the comrades from the medical company, they stopped, bleating, and affectionately rubbed against the soldiers' legs. What was going on here? Just as I was wondering, the medical company commander came over, smiling and shaking hands with the Ahjumma. Then, he and several soldiers led the children, accompanying the Ahjumma and herded the sheep back to the agricultural cooperative. At that moment, the chickens being carried by the soldiers clucked softly, and the sheep bleated on their way home. How could they know what this was all about?
    Back in the dormitory, Assistant Wang told me the whole story.
      "Do you remember that slightly taller girl wearing a red scarf?" Before I could answer, he continued, "The Ahjumma and her husband only have that one daughter. Some time ago, the girl suddenly fell ill with some kind of stomach swelling disease. She hadn't eaten anything in eight days and was as thin as a twig, on the verge of death. Just when her life was in danger, the comrades from our medical company found out and immediately sent a doctor to treat her, saving her life. During her recovery, the medical company continued to send people to check on her and deliver medicine every day, sometimes even bringing candy for her. The child quickly recovered, and the Ahjumma was endlessly grateful. One day, she brought these two hens as a token of her gratitude. How could our Volunteer Army accept gifts from the masses so easily! But, after repeatedly refusing without success, we had to accept them. The medical company held a soldiers' meeting and everyone unanimously decided: to temporarily keep the chickens, and when they laid eggs and hatched some chicks, to return the hens and chicks to the Ahjumma when we return home; that would truly be lasting friendship! From then on, in addition to handling daily affairs, the duty officer had to feed these two chickens like a nanny. But the chickens didn't understand the sentiment behind it! They weren't used to this place and took every opportunity to sneak back to their old home. Today's duty officer was being criticised by his comrades for this. The comrades originally thought the chickens were lost, but the Ahjumma brought them back.
      "It's also a coincidence..." he continued, "This spring, the medical company bought eight sheep from the motherland, intending to slaughter them to improve the troops' living conditions. But when the soldiers heard the decision to withdraw the troops, they all suggested leaving the sheep behind to give to the agricultural cooperative to develop sideline production. To be honest, the mountain grass and spring water here are so good! These eight sheep will multiply into a large flock in a few years! So, the medical company chose representatives and sent the eight sheep to the agricultural cooperative with drums and gongs. Also, because the lambs were used to living with the troops, they would secretly run back several times a day. Whenever they came back, the soldiers would send them back again.

    "And so, the Ahjumma sent the chickens back, and the soldiers sent the sheep back, sent back, sent again...."

    送回来，送回去
    志愿军战士　松岗
    今天的假日和往常一样，是去帮助安平里农业社修水渠。傍晚，我们收工回营走到卫生连驻地的时候，忽然见到一群官兵散乱地集聚在那里，大家七嘴八舌的嚷着！“鸡跑到哪里去了？你把值班员的职责都忘了吗？”人群中间，有一位戴着值班员红袖章的战士，像犯了什么大错误，羞愧地站在那里倾听着大家的指责。
    “这是怎么回事呢？值班员跟鸡有什么关系呢？”我们一时弄不清头尾。正在这时，一群朝鲜孩子簇拥着一位阿妈尼抱着两只鸡走来了。卫生连的同志们立刻迎上去，高兴地把鸡接过来，指手划脚地说了一些话。知道内情的人都笑了。
    双方正在互相告别的时候，又有一群孩子依哩哇啦地追逐着一群羊跑来了。大家马上来了个一线散开，堵住了羊的去路。羊儿见了卫生连的同志们，都咩咩叫着停住了，一个个亲热地偎着战士们的大腿转来转去。这又是怎么回事呢？我正在纳闷的时候，卫生连连长走过来，笑嘻嘻的和阿妈尼握手问好，接着，又同几个战士领着孩子，伴送着阿妈尼，赶着羊群送回了农业社。这时，送来的鸡在战士们的怀里咕咕的啼着，送走的羊儿在归途中咩咩叫着，它们怎么会知道这是为了什么呢。
    回到宿舍里，王助理员才把这件事情的来龙去脉告诉了我。
      “你记得那个带红领巾的、稍微高一点的女孩子吗？”他没等我回答就又接着说，“阿妈尼和她的丈夫只有这么一个女孩子。前些日子，忽然女孩子生病了，是什么胃肿症，八天中茶饭没沾牙，孩子瘦的像根干柴似的，眼看就没有命了。就在这女孩子生命危险的时候，被我们卫生连的同志知道了，立刻派医生去给孩子治疗，这个女孩子才得救了。女孩子在恢复健康期间，卫生连还是每天派人去复诊送药，有时还买一些糖果给孩子带去。这样，孩子的病很快就好了，阿妈尼说不尽的感激。一天，她便送来了这两只母鸡，作为酬礼。我们志愿军怎能随便接收群众的礼物呢！但，经过再三谢绝无效时，只好收下了。为了这件事，卫生连召开了个军人大会，大家一致决定：把鸡暂时养着，等鸡生了蛋再孵出几只小鸡，到我们回国的时候，连老母鸡和小鸡一起送还给阿妈尼；这才真是友谊长存呢！从此，值班员除了处理日常事情外，还得像保姆似地喂养着这两只鸡。可是，这鸡不懂这其中的情谊呀！它们不习惯这个地方，得到机会就溜回老家去了。今天的值班员就是为了这个受到了同志们的指责。同志们原来以为鸡失落了，可是阿妈尼又把它们送回来了。
      “事情也凑巧……”他接着又说：“今年春天，卫生连从祖国买来了八只羊，准备杀了改善部队生活，可是，当战士们听到要撤军的决定以后，都建议把羊留下来，赠给农业社发展副业生产。说实在的，这里的山草、泉水有多么好呀！这八只羊住几年就会繁殖一大群羊的！于是，卫生连选出了代表，敲锣打鼓地把八只羊送给了农业社。也是因为小羊在部队住习惯了，每天都要偷偷地跑回来几次。只要一回来，战士们就又把它们送回去了，
    “就这样，阿妈尼把鸡送回来，战士把羊送回去，送回来，送回去……。”
