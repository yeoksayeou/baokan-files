Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 9th - The crimes of American imperialism in interfering in China's internal affairs have aroused the anger of patriotic overseas Chinese. Many patriotic overseas Chinese have written letters or sent telegrams to express their sympathy and solicitude to the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense front troops and the people in the front-line areas, and expressed their determination to fight alongside the people of the motherland to resolutely oppose American imperialist aggression and liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan.

The entire Chinese community in Mumbai, India, recently sent a telegram to all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, saying that the Chinese in Mumbai are determined to fully support the People's Liberation Army in its struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the liberation of Taiwan, and will always be their staunch support. The Chinese Association of Nganjuk, Indonesia, said in a letter of sympathy to the front-line troops that all patriotic overseas Chinese in Nganjuk are extremely angry about the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in harassing the coastal areas and are determined to strengthen the patriotic unity movement of overseas Chinese and support the People's Liberation Army in its struggle to liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan with practical actions. The Chinese Association of Lawang, Indonesia, sent a telegram to the teachers and students of Xiamen University and Xiamen No. 3 Middle School who were shelled by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, expressing their cordial sympathy.

The overseas Chinese organizations that sent letters and telegrams of sympathy to the front-line troops and the people in the front-line areas also include the Board of Directors of the Chinese School in Palembang, Indonesia, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Palembang, the Alumni Association of Jimme School in Yangon, Myanmar, and the Overseas Chinese Association of Lugang in Myanmar.
