    A Division Commander's Letter Home as a Private
    Zhao Zhihua, People's Liberation Army stationed in Jilin
    "Yunying: It's been a long time since I wrote to you. Your letter from half a month ago just reached me today. You really want to come here to see me? Alright! Please allow Private Li Hua to report the situation to you.
    "You might say: What, a private? Yes, don't rush, listen to me!
    "On National Day night, just when you were taking Lili to see the fireworks at Tiananmen Square, Old Chen and I boarded the train directly to Jilin from Shenyang. Before boarding, I shaved my beard again and again to look younger, but it was no use. The hard-seat carriage was crowded, and passengers kept looking at Chen and me with surprise. We pretended to be fine and chatted with the folks.
    "Chatting with the masses was a lot of fun. Here are a few interesting dialogues for you:
    'Comrade, you're so old, does the conscription office still want you?'
    'Old man, we are responding to the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on cadres participating in physical labor and have been sent down to the company as soldiers.'
    'No wonder, I was wondering when did they have such an old conscript! These are all cadres educated by Chairman Mao!'
    "The train arrived in Jilin just as it was getting light. I've been here often, so the road is naturally familiar! Chief of Staff Chen, no! It should be Comrade Private Chen Ji. After getting off the train, he went to the bus stop to queue. Half an hour before the bus left, I poked Old Chen: 'How about carrying forward the glorious tradition? Twenty li, let's get to the company for breakfast.' Old Chen said: 'Good!' We immediately shouldered our backpacks and strode along the suburban avenue.
    "The autumn hillsides and forests were golden. In the fields, piles of crops were stacked like small mountains. Workers who had just finished the night shift were in high spirits, talking and laughing as they walked. The roadside lights used for the rush repair of local blast furnaces overnight hadn't been turned off yet. Rows of tall chimneys in the factories were already belching thick smoke. How beautiful is the motherland's morning!
    "The more we walked, the more energetic we became. We walked more than ten li in one breath, covered in sweat. A bit tired, but when I thought of the war years, you must remember, we ran circles every day, how many times did we not walk a hundred and eighty li in a hurry, it's nothing really, how can we be worse now? That won't do! With that thought, I added fuel to my feet and walked faster and faster.
    "Walking, walking, Old Chen suddenly came to grab my backpack: 'Let's have some mutual assistance in marching, this is also a glorious tradition!' I quickly declined: 'That won't do, don't think I'm ten years older than you, I was in the iron-legged squad during the Long March, I guarantee I won't fall behind you.' That really worked, he didn't grab it anymore. Ha! My old arthritis can't fool you!
    "We heard that the company we were going to had two new recruits coming today. The company commander and political instructor led a dozen soldiers to meet them two or three li away, and ran over to grab our backpacks from afar. We hurried up and saluted: 'Company Commander, Privates Li Hua and Chen Ji are reporting for duty.' The company commander didn't know what to do for a moment, his face flushed red: 'Political Commissar,... um! Division leaders, please come to the company for a rest!' Old Chen said correctly: 'Company Commander, you are the leader, just call us by our names. Please give us 'new soldier veterans' more help and education in the future.'
    "Yunying: Guess who this company commander is? You must not have forgotten, it's Hou Yushan, Little Hou, the guard who always followed me during the Liberation War. He is the youngest company commander in the entire division, and still looks like a child!
    "That's how we returned to our 'mother's home.' We arrived just in time for breakfast, devoured a few pieces of steaming sorghum flour cake, and drank two bowls of soy milk with relish. After breakfast, the company went to the mountains for tactical exercises. The company leaders wanted us to sleep, how could that work? After a lot of begging, we were allowed to follow them up the mountain.
    "The intense company life began!
    "Report temporarily ends here. Without me saying, you will definitely give up the idea of coming to see me and concentrate on your work! Take good care of Lili, see you next year!"

    师长列兵的家信
    解放军驻吉林部队　赵志华
    “蕴英：好久没给你写信了。你半月前写的信今天才转到我手里。你真的要上我这儿来吗？好吧！请允许列兵李桦向你报告情况。
    “你也许会说：什么，列兵？是的，你不要忙，听我说下去！
    “国庆之夜，正是你带着丽丽在天安门看焰火的时候，我和老陈搭上了沈阳直达吉林的列车。上车前，我把胡子刮了又刮，这样会显得年青一些，可是这也无济于事。硬席车厢里人很多，来来往往的乘客都看着我和老陈出奇。我俩装没事一样的和老乡们搭讪。
    “和群众聊天很起劲，摘几句有趣的对话给你听：
    ‘同志你这么大岁数，兵役局要你吗？’
    ‘老大爷，我们是响应党中央和国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的决定下放到连队当兵的。’
    ‘怪不得，我是说没见过这么老的义务兵吗！这都是毛主席教育出的干部啊！’
    “车到吉林天刚亮。过去常来这里，路自然很熟咯！陈参谋长，不！应该是列兵陈迹同志，下了火车就到公共汽车站去排队了。离开车还有半小时，我捅了老陈一下：‘发扬一下光荣传统怎么样？二十里路，赶到连队吃早饭。’老陈说：‘好哇！’我们随即背起背包，顺着郊区大道撩开了步子。
    “秋天的山坡、树林一片金黄。田野里一堆堆庄稼垛得像一座座小山。刚下夜班的工人精神抖擞，有说有笑的走着。连夜赶修土高炉用的路旁电灯还没熄掉。工厂里一排排高大的烟囱已经吐着浓烟。祖国的早晨多么美好啊！
    “越走越带劲，一口气走了十来里，满头大汗了。有点累，但一想起过去战争年代，你一定记得，那时候天天跑圈子，哪次不是急走百儿八十里的，真不算啥，如今怎么比不上了？这可不行！这么一想，脚底加了油，倒越走越快了。
    “走着，走着，老陈突然来抢我的背包：‘来个行军互助吧，这也是光荣传统！’我急忙谢绝：‘这可不行，别看我比你年长十岁，当年长征中铁腿班的兵，保险掉不到你后面。’这一下真灵，他不抢了。哈！我这老关节炎可哄不了你呀！
    “我们去的这个连，听说今天来了两个新兵，连长、指导员带着十几名战士接出来两三里，老远就跑过来抢背包。我们赶上去行了个礼：‘连长同志，列兵李桦、陈迹报到。’连长一时不知如何才好，脸顿时通红：‘政委，……嗯！师首长们快到连里歇歇吧！’老陈说得对：‘连长同志，你是首长，尽管叫我俩名字。以后请多帮助教育我们这‘新兵老战士。’
    “蕴英：你猜一猜，这个连长是谁？你一定没忘掉，就是解放战争中一直跟着我的警卫员小侯子侯玉山。他是全师最年青的连长，看起来还带着过去那种孩子气呢！
    “我们就这样回到了‘娘家’。正赶上早饭，狼吞虎咽的吃了几块热腾腾的高粱面发糕，又美美的喝上两碗豆浆。饭后，连队到山地进行战术演习。连首长要我们俩睡觉，这那能行呢？经过苦苦的请求，才允许跟着上山。
    “紧张的连队生活开始了！
    “报告暂到这里。不用我说，你一定会放弃来看我的念头而安心工作罗！好好照顾丽丽，咱们明年见！”
