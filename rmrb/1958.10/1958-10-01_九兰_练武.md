“Nine Orchid” Practice Martial Arts
By our reporters Ding Gu and Jiang Qingzhao

The "Nine Orchid Group," famous at home and abroad for their glorious achievements in the Ming Tombs Reservoir project, has now become an outstanding female militia. With excitement and pride, they are intensifying their martial arts training, improving their skills, and preparing to march heroically across Tiananmen Square with the mighty militia队伍(d隊伍–contingent), during the great National Day celebration, to receive the review of our beloved leader Chairman Mao.

On the eve of National Day, when we visited them, we saw them all holding shiny submachine guns, looking heroic and spirited. If they were to put on military uniforms, they would truly look like capable female soldiers.

These nine brave and hardworking girls recently returned from a visit abroad. They told us that in mid-September, when they were still in Moscow, upon hearing the news that American imperialism was conducting military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and conspiring to expand its aggression against our country, they were all burning with anger and so agitated that they couldn't sleep at night. How much they wished to immediately fly back to the motherland and, together with the people of the motherland, take up arms and fight these rampant beasts! The three girls who had just turned seventeen, Sun Shulan, Liu Jilan, and Jin Shulan, were worried that they were too young to join the militia, and they were so anxious that they didn't know what to do. Although the older sisters comforted and encouraged them, they still couldn't put their minds at ease. Finally, these three clever girls came up with a reason to argue: "Don't look at how young we are, we are taller than our guns. As for determination, let alone American paper tigers, we will smash even iron tigers!"

With this noble aspiration and iron will, the heroic girls, after returning to their motherland and hometown, immediately requested to join the militia and immediately threw themselves into military training. When they first arrived on the training ground, they didn't even know how to stand at ease or attention, but they wanted to carry forward the courageous spirit they displayed in building the Ming Tombs Reservoir and exert the power of the collective – "Nine Orchid, one heart" – to make difficulties bow their heads to them. Therefore, they automatically formed a mutual learning assistance group and launched a competition with all the female militia members, often using rest and breaks to teach and learn from each other, and sometimes practicing diligently under the moonlight at night. In this way, in just a few days, the "Nine Orchid Group" has achieved excellent results in military training. (Attached picture)

    “九兰”练武
    本报记者　丁固　姜庆肇
    曾经在十三陵水库工程中建立光辉功迹而闻名中外的“九兰组”，今天已成了优秀的女民兵。她们怀着激奋和骄傲的心情，正在加紧练武，提高本领，准备在伟大的国庆节日里，同浩浩荡荡的民兵队伍一道，雄赳赳地迈过天安门广场，接受敬爱的领袖毛主席的检阅。
    国庆前夕，当我们去访问她们的时候，看到她们都端着乌亮的冲锋枪，英姿焕发，如果再穿上军装，那就真像精明强干的女兵了。
    这九个勇敢勤劳的姑娘，不久前才出国访问回来。她们告诉我们，在9月中旬，当她们还在莫斯科，听到美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅，并阴谋对我国扩大侵略活动的消息时，个个怒火烧心，激愤得连夜睡不着觉。她们多么希望立刻飞回祖国，和祖国人民一道拿起武器，打这些横行霸道的野兽啊！三个刚满十七岁的姑娘，孙淑兰、刘继兰和金淑兰，怕自己的年纪小，当不上民兵，急得不知如何是好。虽然大姐们安慰鼓励她们，可是她们怎么也放不下心。最后，这三个聪明的姑娘终于想出准备争辩的理由：“别看我们的年纪小，我们的个头却比枪高。至于说决心嚒，别说是美国纸老虎，就是铁老虎也要砸烂它！”
    英雄的姑娘们就是怀着这种崇高的愿望和钢铁般的意志，在回到祖国和家乡以后，便马上要求参加了民兵队，并立即投入军事训练。她们第一天上操场时，连稍息立正都不会，可是她们要发扬在修建十三陵水库中的勇敢作风，发挥集体的力量——“九兰一条心”，让困难向她们低头。于是，她们自动成立了学习互助组，并且和全队女民兵展开了竞赛，经常利用休息和空隙时间互教互学，有时晚上也在月亮下勤学苦练。就这样，“九兰组”在短短的几天里，已取得了军事训练的优秀成绩。（附图片）
