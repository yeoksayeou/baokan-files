　　Don't Put Money in Command
　　Shi Jing

　　Since the Great Leap Forward in production this year, production tasks in many factories in Shanghai have increased several times over. Under these circumstances, the production tasks of workers receiving time-based wages have also increased, but their wages remain the same. However, the wages of workers receiving piece-rate wages have increased dramatically. According to statistics from the machinist, foundry, and forging workshops of the diesel engine factory, the average proportion by which piece-rate workers' earnings exceeded their basic wages was: February: 23.32%, 37.4%, 49.06%; April: 42.16%, 61.14%, 78.92%. A grade three or four worker with a basic wage of fifty or sixty yuan was actually earning one hundred and ten or twenty yuan. It was also very common for grade two workers to earn eighty or ninety yuan. In machine tool factories, electrical machinery factories, and shipyards, there were not a few piece-rate workers whose actual income exceeded their basic wage by more than double. In an electrical machinery factory, individual grade four workers earned around three hundred yuan. This situation caused contradictions between time-based workers and piece-rate workers. Many piece-rate workers themselves also felt very embarrassed: they felt uneasy taking too much money for doing more work, and some would stop working once they exceeded a certain amount, fearing that others would ridicule them for wanting to earn more money. But they were also very anxious about not completing their tasks if they didn't work. The masses of workers, whose awareness had greatly increased after the rectification, anti-rightist, and Great Leap Forward movements, generally believed that the piece-rate wage system could not meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward and was not conducive to high-speed development of production. Therefore, they voluntarily abolished the system. From some situations after June, changing piece-rate wages to time-based wages did not affect workers' enthusiasm for production, as some factory leaders had worried. The facts proved the opposite. Taking the diesel engine factory as an example, the output in April and May (before the piece-rate wage was abolished) was three hundred and three hundred and fifty units, respectively. In June, after the piece-rate wage was abolished, the output increased month by month, and in September it had increased to five hundred and fifty-five units. After the China Textile Machinery Factory abolished piece-rate wages, the daily output of looms increased sharply by more than twenty units in twenty days. In the forging workshop, cold-drawing workers used to average around six hundred work points per person per day, but now they generally reach over one thousand. Worker Gu Qichang used to dare not do more than eight or nine hundred work points a day, but now he does one thousand and six hundred work points. Many workers said: "In the past, piece-rate meant thinking about money, but now time-based means thinking about tasks." Some said: "In the past, I would do more if I was happy, and less if I wasn't, thinking it was my own business and had nothing to do with others. Now, if I do less, I feel sorry for the leaders and the group." With the abolition of piece-rate wages, the collectivist spirit of mutual teaching and mutual assistance among workers has also developed rapidly. The workers call the present "politics in command" and the past piece-rate wage "money in command." They resolutely want politics in command, not money in command. Lu Jianping, a worker at the diesel engine factory, wrote a poem saying: "Political awareness is rising steadily, time-based is better than piece-rate. High output and quality are guaranteed, the red flag will always flutter in the wind."

　　It is not difficult to see from this situation in Shanghai that the actual awareness of the working masses far exceeds the estimates of some factory leaders. They have been able to deeply understand that the current labor is essentially different from the previous labor, and do not insist that more work should mean more money. To a certain extent, they are willing to engage in a kind of labor that has some communist characteristics. This kind of labor, as Lenin said, is "unpaid labor for the benefit of society." This labor "is not performed to fulfill certain obligations, not to enjoy the right to obtain certain products, not according to pre-determined legal quotas, but is voluntary labor, is unlimited labor, is labor that does not expect rewards, has no conditions for rewards, is labor based on the habit of working for the public good, based on the conscious requirement to work for the public good (which has become a habit), this labor is a natural need of a healthy body." If we say that we have not yet fully reached this state, at least there is such a beginning, and our workers have taken a big step forward.

　　No one will deny that we are still building a socialist society. Our level of productive forces has not yet reached the level of development where we can implement "to each according to his needs," and generally we can only distribute consumer goods according to the quantity and quality of labor performed by the laborers. The principle of distribution according to labor is the basic principle of distribution in the socialist stage. It specifically embodies the unity of individual interests and national interests. At the same time, our country also decides economic policies and manages the economic life of the whole people based on the principle of correctly combining individual interests and public interests. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out in his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress that "the state's policies on wages, subsidies, welfare, bonuses, prices, taxes, and profits must reasonably take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. A certain reasonable difference is necessary between the living standards of workers and peasants, between the living standards of urban and rural areas, and between the wages of different types of work, different technical levels, and different regions, but unreasonable and excessive distances should be avoided." This succinctly and concisely clarifies our country's social policies at the current stage.

　　The distribution system of "to each according to his work" is linked to and adapted to a certain historical stage of the development of productive forces. For the capitalist system of exploitation, this is a revolutionary leap, a negation. In a certain historical period, this system will play a positive role in developing production, and at the same time it will be our weapon to fight against the bourgeoisie. This system will attract workers from all countries to participate in the struggle against capital like a red flag. Lenin's slogan "He who does not work, neither shall he eat" once severely hit the exploiting classes who did not work for a living and inspired hundreds of millions of working people. However, for the system of "to each according to his work," we must also treat it as a process, see its occurrence, development, and also see its final destination, just like we treat other things and phenomena. At the current stage of productive forces development, "to each according to his work" is inevitable. But we are not like metaphysicians, regarding it as an eternal thing. We affirm it only to create the conditions to negate it, to negate it at the appropriate time, and to advance society to a higher stage, that is, the communist stage of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." For example, if we now have the conditions to implement a communist-style supply system or semi-supply system, then we should implement it as soon as possible. We should implement as much as we can. We do not want to unconditionally consolidate the socialist principle of distribution according to work; instead, we should always pay attention to shaking it so that it does not grow deep-rooted and become difficult to change. Our attitude towards it is both agreeing and disagreeing.

　　Based on this view, on the one hand, we must stand on the ground, stand on the basis of reality, and not hope to fully implement the principle of "to each according to his needs" too early. That is impossible and not conducive to the development of production. But on the other hand, we must also make our people understand that we still have more distant and more glorious goals of struggle behind us, waiting for us to strive for. In order to strive to achieve more distant and more glorious goals, we cannot over-calculate some small personal interests in front of us, and sometimes we need to sacrifice some of these small interests. Otherwise, we will lose big because of small, and harm the future because of the present. This is called socialist reality and communist thought. These two seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are unified. Having clear communist ideas and goals of struggle can enable us to see the sprouts of communism from the reality of socialism, cultivate them, support them, and make them strong. The growth of these sprouts promotes the development of communist thought, so that communism grows up in more aspects, eventually leading to a qualitative change in the entire society.

　　Some comrades often underestimate the wisdom and revolutionary awareness of the working masses, thinking that workers can only see some small interests in front of them. Now the facts prove that they are wrong. The working masses do not reduce their enthusiasm for labor just because they take less wages, as they thought. On the contrary, on the one hand, they voluntarily abolish unreasonable and excessively high remuneration, and on the other hand, they step up the development of production. They want to create the conditions for the realization of the communist principle of distribution - "to each according to his needs" - more quickly. The working masses are fully capable of deeply understanding their historical position and historical mission, and therefore they are fully capable of correctly understanding and handling their own immediate interests and long-term interests.

　　The facts in Shanghai show that we also need to have a developing point of view when looking at the working masses. Compared with the time of liberation in 1949, the footsteps of the working masses, like the actual situation of our country (including productive forces), have gone far ahead. What our country could not do in the past, what we did not have, we have now done and have. What is reflected in the consciousness of the workers will of course be what was not clear in the past, but is now clear. What could not be believed in the past is now believed. Then, why don't they struggle for a more distant and more glorious future? Why can't they sacrifice a little immediate interest? And some of our comrades still look at them with the perspective of the past, so deviations and errors occur.

　　Communists are the leaders of the people, and they should see higher and further in order to guide the people to move forward continuously. In order to do this, they must always live among the masses, share the breath with the masses, and be familiar with every new development and change in the thoughts and feelings of the masses. Otherwise, they will actually fall behind the advancing ranks of the people and become a tail.

    不要钞票挂帅
    史经
    今年生产大跃进以来，上海很多工厂生产任务猛增几倍。在这种情况下，领取计时工资的工人生产任务同样增加，工资仍按原数。而领取计件工资的工人所得工资却直线上升。柴油机厂的机工、铸工、锻工三个车间统计，计件工人因此所得的超过基本工资的比例平均为：2月份：23.32％，37.4％，49.06％。4月份：42.16％，61.14％，78.92％。一个三、四级工基本工资五、六十元，实际收入达到一百一、二十元。二级工收入八、九十元的也极普遍。在机床厂，电机厂，造船厂，计件工人实际收入超过基本工资一倍以上的不在少数。电机厂个别四级工收入达到三百元上下。这种情况引起计时工人和计件工人间的矛盾。许多计件工人自己也感到很为难：干多了工资拿得太多过意不去，有的超额到一定程度就停手，怕别人讽刺自己想多拿钱。而不干又眼看任务完不成很着急。经过整风反右和大跃进运动觉悟大大提高了的工人群众，普遍认为计件工资制度不能适应大跃进的要求，对高速度发展生产不利。于是纷纷自动起来废除这个制度。从6月份以后一些情况看，把计件工资改为计时工资，并不像某些工厂领导干部所担心的那样，会影响工人生产积极性。事实恰好相反。以柴油机厂为例，4月和5月（计件工资未取消）产量是三百台和三百五十台，6月份取消了计件工资，产量逐月上升，9月份已增至五百五十五台。中国纺织机械厂取消计件工资后二十天织机日产量猛增二十台以上。锻压车间冷拉工人过去一人一天平均做六百个左右工分，现在普遍达到一千个以上。工人顾其昌过去一天做到八九百工分就不敢再多做了，现在做到一千六百工分。不少工人说：“过去计件想钞票，现在计时想任务。”有的说：“过去高兴就多做，不高兴就少做，觉得是自己的事，与别人无关。现在做少了觉得对不起领导，对不起小组。”随着计件工资的废除，工人间互教互助的集体主义思想也有了迅速的发展。工人们把现在称为“政治挂帅”，把过去的计件工资称为“钞票挂帅”。他们坚决要政治挂帅，不要钞票挂帅。柴油机厂工人陆建平写了一首诗说：“政治觉悟节节高，计时要比计件好。产量高来质量保，红旗永远迎风飘。”
    从上海这个情况里不难看出，工人群众的实际觉悟远远超过了一些工厂领导人的估计。他们已经能够深刻地理解现在的劳动同从前的劳动有本质的区别，并不坚持多做就要多拿钱。在一定程度上说，他们甘愿进行一种多少具有共产主义性质的劳动。这种劳动，如列宁所说的，是“一种为社会造福的无报酬的劳动”。这种劳动“不是为了履行一定的义务，不是为了享有取得某种产品的权利，不是按照事先规定的法定定额进行的劳动，而是自愿的劳动，是无定额的劳动，是不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动，是根据为公共利益劳动的习惯、根据必须为公共利益劳动的自觉要求（这已成为习惯）来进行的劳动，这种劳动是健康的身体的自然需要。”倘使说现时我们还没有完全达到这种境地，至少是有了这样一个开端，我们的工人前进了一大步。
    谁也不会否认，我们还正在建设社会主义社会。我们的生产力水平，还没有达到可以实行“各取所需”的发展程度，一般只能按照劳动者劳动的数量和质量来分配消费品。按劳取酬的原则，是社会主义阶段进行分配的基本原则。它具体地体现了个人利益与国家利益的一致。同时，我们的国家也正是根据个人利益与公共利益正确结合的原则来决定经济政策，管理全民的经济生活的。刘少奇同志在“八大”二次会议的工作报告中曾经指出，“国家关于工资、补贴、福利、奖金、价格、税收和利润等方面的政策，都必须合理地兼顾国家、集体和个人三方面的利益。在工农生活水平、城乡生活水平之间，在不同工种、不同技术等级、不同地区的工资之间，一定的合理的差别是必要的，但是应当避免不合理的过大的距离”。这里简单而扼要地阐明了我们国家在目前阶段的社会政策。
    按劳取酬这种分配制度，是同生产力发展的一定历史阶段相联系相适应的。对资产阶级的剥削制度来说，这是一个革命的飞跃，是一个否定。在一定的历史时期，这种制度将在发展生产上发挥它的积极作用，同时也将是我们对资产阶级进行斗争的武器。这个制度会像一面红旗一样吸引各个国家的工人来参加反对资本的斗争。列宁所提出的“不劳动者不得食”的口号，曾经沉重地打击了不劳而获的剥削阶级，鼓舞了亿万劳动群众。但是，对于按劳取酬这个制度，我们也必须像对待其他事物现象一样，把它看成一个过程，看到它的发生、发展，也看到它的最后归趋。在当前的生产力发展阶段上，按劳取酬是不可免的。但我们并不是像形而上学者一样，把它看成永恒的东西。我们肯定它，只是为了创造否定它的条件，在适当的时候来否定它，把社会推进到更高的阶段，即各尽所能各取所需的共产主义阶段。比如现在有了条件实行共产主义性质的供给制或半供给制，那我们就要尽快实行。能实行多少就实行多少。我们对于社会主义的按劳分配原则，并不是要无条件地去巩固它；而要经常注意去动摇它，使它不至长得根深蒂固，积重难返。我们对它的态度，是又赞成，又不赞成。
    根据这种观点，我们一方面要把脚跟站在土地上，站在现实的基础上，不要希望过早地完全实行“各取所需”的原则。那是办不到的，也不利于发展生产。但是另一方面，我们也必须使我们的人民懂得，我们还有更远大更光辉的奋斗目标在后面，要我们去争取它。为了争取达到更远大更光辉的目标，我们就不能过多地计较个人的眼前的一些小小的利益，有时候还需要牺牲一些这样的小利益。不然就会因小失大，因现在妨害将来。这叫做社会主义的实际，共产主义的思想。这两者看去有矛盾，实则是统一的。有明确的共产主义思想和奋斗目标，可以使我们从社会主义的现实中看见共产主义的萌芽，培育它，扶植它，使它壮大。这些萌芽的滋长，又促进共产主义思想的发展，使共产主义在更多的方面生长起来，终至发生整个社会的质变。
    有一些同志时常低估工人群众的智慧和革命觉悟，以为工人只能看到眼前一些小的利益，现在事实证明他们错了。工人群众并不像他们所想的，少拿几个工钱就会降低劳动积极性。相反的，他们一方面自动起来取消不合理的过高报酬，一方面加紧发展生产。他们要更快地创造实现共产主义分配原则——各取所需的条件。工人群众完全能够深刻地理解自己的历史地位和历史使命，因此也就完全能够正确地认识和处理自己的眼前利益和长远利益。
    上海的事实表明：在看待工人群众上也需要有发展的观点。与1949年刚解放的时候相比，工人群众的脚跟也同我们国家的实际情况（包括生产力）一样，远远地走前去了。过去我们国家做不到的，没有的，现在做到了，有了。反映在工人的意识上的，当然会是过去看不清的，现在看清了。过去不能确信的，现在确信了。那么，他们为什么不为更远大更光辉的前途奋斗呢？为什么不能牺牲眼前一点小利呢？而我们有些同志还拿过去的眼光看他们，所以就发生了偏差和错误。
    共产党人是人民群众的领导者，他们应该看得更高些更远些，以便引导人民不断前进。而要想做到这一些，他们就必须经常生活在群众中间，与群众同呼吸，熟悉群众思想感情的每一个新的发展和变化。不如此，他们就会实际上落到人民群众前进队伍的后面，成为一条尾巴。
