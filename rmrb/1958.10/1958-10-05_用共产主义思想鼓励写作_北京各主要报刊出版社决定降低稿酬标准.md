    Using Communist Ideology to Encourage Writing
    Major Beijing Newspapers and Publishers Decide to Lower Manuscript Fees

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Major Beijing newspapers and publishers, including People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Ta Kung Pao, China Youth Daily, People's Publishing House, People's Literature Publishing House, Writers Publishing House, Science Press, China Youth Publishing House, and People's Fine Arts Publishing House, are enthusiastically responding to the actions of Shanghai newspapers and publishers in lowering manuscript fees. On the 28th, representatives from various units held a symposium and decided to uniformly implement a general reduction of manuscript fees by about half, starting from October 1st, and issued a proposal to newspapers and publishers nationwide.

    The symposium pointed out that since liberation, especially in recent years, manuscript fees for books and newspapers have greatly increased, and the income of authors from manuscript fees has significantly improved compared to pre-liberation times. This has played a certain role in ensuring the livelihoods of authors, encouraging creation, and promoting academic culture. However, there are also very unreasonable situations, which have had some adverse effects on society. The main points are: Now, most authors and translators have occupations and normal salary income, which can meet their living needs. A large amount of manuscript fee income often leads to their living standards being higher than those of ordinary working people, forming a special status for this group and detaching them from the workers and peasants. At the same time, some young people who are beginning to write and students who are beginning to translate, seeing the generous manuscript fees for writing and translation, even neglect their regular work and studies in pursuit of manuscript fees. Some disregard the work assigned by the state and want to get rich by translating books. It now appears that excessively generous manuscript fees for authors and translators not only fail to play a positive role, but on the contrary, have produced serious adverse consequences, causing some people to develop bourgeois individualistic ideas of fame and profit, fostering the erroneous idea of ​​despising physical labor, and artificially increasing the gap between physical and mental labor. This is extremely incompatible with the current situation and the trend of social development in our country. In particular, with the rapid development of social productive forces and the universal improvement of the communist consciousness of the people across the country, and the unprecedented prosperity of literary and artistic creation by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the current high manuscript fee system is clearly completely unable to adapt to this new situation. In view of the above situation, everyone unanimously believes that it is necessary to greatly reduce the current manuscript fee standards.

    Qian Junrui, Deputy Minister of Culture, attended the symposium. He expressed strong support for the decision of the newspapers and publishers to lower manuscript fee standards. He said: Lowering manuscript fees, and even fundamentally changing the manuscript fee system, has important political significance and is an inevitable trend of social development. It is conducive to the integration of physical and mental labor, conducive to the ideological transformation of intellectuals, and conducive to the improvement of the communist ideological level of cultural publishing work. Today, most authors write for socialism and communism, not for manuscript fees. Therefore, our newspapers' and publishers' decision to lower manuscript fee standards is correct and timely. The past practice of using high manuscript fees to solicit manuscripts was clearly wrong. In the future, we should use communist ideology to mobilize and organize the vast number of authors and the masses to work hard at writing.

    用共产主义思想鼓励写作
    北京各主要报刊出版社决定降低稿酬标准
    新华社讯　北京各主要报刊、出版社，包括人民日报、光明日报、大公报、中国青年报、人民出版社、人民文学出版社、作家出版社、科学出版社、中国青年出版社、人民美术出版社在内，热烈响应上海报刊、出版社降低稿酬标准的行动。28日各单位代表举行座谈会，决定自10月1日起，一致实行一般地降低稿酬标准一半左右的办法，并向全国各报刊、出版社发出倡议。
    座谈会指出：解放后，尤其是近几年来，书籍和报刊的稿酬有很大增长，作者的稿酬收入比解放前有显著的提高。这对保障作者生活，鼓励创作和繁荣学术文化，曾起了一定的作用。但同时也存在着很不合理情况，对社会起了一些不良影响。主要是：现在一般著译者都有职业，有正常的工薪收入，可以满足生活需要。大量稿费收入往往促使他们生活水平高于一般劳动人民，形成这一部分人生活特殊化，脱离工农群众。同时，有些初学写作的青年和初学翻译的学生，看到写作和翻译有优厚稿酬，甚至为了追求稿费而荒废正业和学习，有的不顾服从国家分配的工作，想靠译书致富。现在看来，对著译者过于优厚的稿酬，不但不能起积极作用，相反，产生了严重的不良后果，使一部分人滋长了资产阶级个人主义名利思想，助长了轻视体力劳动的错误思想，人为地加大了体力劳动与脑力劳动的差异。这是与我国当前形势和社会发展的趋势极不相适应的。特别是目前社会生产力迅速发展，全国人民群众共产主义觉悟普遍提高，广大工农兵文艺创作空前繁荣，现行的高稿酬制度显然已经完全不能适应这一新的形势。鉴于上述情况，大家一致认为有将现行稿酬标准大大降低的必要。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞出席了这次座谈会。他对各报刊、出版社降低稿酬标准的决定，表示大力支持。他说：降低稿酬以至根本改变稿酬制度，有重要的政治意义，也是社会发展的必然趋势。它有利于体力劳动与脑力劳动的结合，有利于知识分子的思想改造，有利于文化出版工作的共产主义思想水平的提高。今天，大部分作者写作是为了社会主义和共产主义，而不是为了稿费。因此，我们报刊、出版社降低稿酬标准的决定是正确的，适时的。过去用高稿酬去拉稿的办法，显然是错误的。今后我们应当用共产主义思想去动员和组织广大作者和群众努力写作。
