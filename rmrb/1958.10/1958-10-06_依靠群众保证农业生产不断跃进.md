Rely on the Masses to Ensure Continuous Leaps Forward in Agricultural Production
Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee

The Grain Shortage Situation in Gansu Has Been Fundamentally Changed

The 13 million people of Gansu Province are celebrating this year's bumper harvest with great excitement. The total grain output of the province has increased from 8.5 billion jin last year to 20 billion jin this year, a net increase of approximately 140%. This rate of growth is unprecedented in Gansu Province. Before liberation, the total grain output of Gansu Province was 3.9 billion jin. In the eight years from 1950 to 1957, the total grain output increased by 4.6 billion jin, only equal to 40% of this year's increase. The per-mu yield of grain was 101 jin in 1949, increasing to 175 jin by 1957, an increase of 74 jin; this year, the per-mu yield jumped to 405 jin, an increase of 230 jin compared to last year, achieving the "four, five, eight" targets of the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. Calculated on the basis of per capita grain quantity, in 1949, each person had 321 jin, in 1957, each person had 700 jin, and in 1958, each person had an average of 1,540 jin of grain. The situation of grain shortage or lack of grain affluence in the province has been fundamentally changed.

This year's bumper grain harvest in Gansu Province is a glorious victory. This victory is the result of the resolute implementation of the various policies of the Party Central Committee by Party organizations at all levels in Gansu, and moving forward while holding high the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong! This victory is the result of consolidating and further strengthening the leadership of the Party through the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, repelling the Rightists' attack on the Party, and liquidating Right-leaning opportunist thinking within the Party! This victory is the result of the people of the province actively implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Nanning Conference, and the Chengdu Conference, breaking down superstitions, emancipating their minds, uprooting white flags, planting red flags, and establishing the communist revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act! This victory is the result of our actively learning from the advanced experiences of various fraternal provinces!

In recent years, Gansu Province has encountered many difficulties in agricultural production. This year's grain harvest was obtained through struggle against various difficulties. Looking back on the road we have travelled, the actual struggle has given us many experiences and lessons, enabling us to have a deeper understanding of how to correctly implement the Party's policies, comprehensively implement the general line of socialist construction, and achieve the transition from socialism to communism at an early date.

Agricultural Harvest is the Result of an Ideological Harvest

This year's agricultural harvest is actually an ideological harvest. Ideological work and political work are forever the soul and commander of all work. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always taught us this way. The thorough implementation of this instruction at any time, in any work, and in any corner has become an inexhaustible force for promoting the continuous leap forward of various tasks in Gansu Province. Ideology is the soul, politics is the commander, uprooting white flags and planting red flags means establishing the absolute dominance of the Party's ideology in all tasks, and it means unswervingly carrying out irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena that violate the Party's line. The practice of agricultural production in Gansu proves that objectively there are no low-yielding crops, low-yielding land, or low-yielding natural conditions; there are only low-yielding leadership ideas and low-yielding backward measures. Of all the thousands of principles, the Party's leadership is the first. Actual struggle has made us fully understand the great significance of "not yielding an inch of ground when planting red flags" both rationally and perceptually. This struggle is not only reflected in the aspect of socialist transformation, but also in the aspect of transforming nature, that is to say, "to revolutionize nature, one must first revolutionize one's ideology."

Recalling the time before the autumn of 1955, when those who advocated the "Gansu Backwardness Theory" emphasized Gansu's backwardness and intentionally obliterated the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, causing the cause of agricultural cooperativization to stagnate, the development speed of agricultural production was slow. Because those who advocated the "Gansu Backwardness Theory" observed things with a reactionary metaphysical viewpoint and did not understand the dialectical relationship that the people in economically backward areas are the most revolutionary people, they always exaggerated the unfavorable aspects of objective things to revolutionary work, attempting to negate the leading role of the Party and the subjective initiative of people in the process of transforming society and transforming nature. We launched a struggle against this tendency. This struggle was a struggle of dialectical materialism against metaphysical idealism in theory; in revolutionary practice, it was a struggle of advancing versus retreating. After this Right-leaning opportunist thinking was criticized, a high tide of socialist transformation immediately appeared throughout the province, followed by a high tide of agricultural production, building more than 4.3 million mu of irrigated land, increasing grain production by 2.6 billion jin, a net increase of 31%, creating a new record for grain production increase. However, this ideological revolution did not continue, and the struggle was not thorough enough. Before long, Rightist elements within the Party and Rightist elements in society colluded to deny our achievements. They nitpicked and looked for individual shortcomings and mistakes in our work, attacking us greatly, saying that this was not good, that was not right, and that all tasks were rushing ahead blindly, launching a fierce attack on the Party, causing great difficulties in actual work. As a result, the agricultural production tasks for 1957 could not be distributed, and the total grain output did not increase much, resulting in a "saddle-shaped" curve in agricultural production. After the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, especially after implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and the Chengdu Conference, various Right-leaning conservative ideas were criticized, people broke down superstitions, emancipated their minds, and established the revolutionary spirit of communism, launching a more vigorous and magnificent socialist high tide throughout the province. A huge movement to march towards nature, centered on water conservancy, was launched on the agricultural front. Taking water conservancy as an example alone, the original plan was to build 15 million mu of irrigated land, but now 17.77 million mu have been completed, which is 3.8 times the irrigated land before liberation, and more than twice the new irrigated land built in the eight years from liberation to 1957. Following the Wushan Dongliang Canal, the emergence of more than 5,000 canals diverting water up the mountains, and the 2,000-li-long Tao River project, marks a new stage in our province's water conservancy cause, and marks that the people of Gansu have been liberated from the shackles of fatalism, no longer waiting for the gift of nature, no longer slaves of nature, but masters of nature, and are able to consciously exert their subjective initiative in the face of nature, study and master the laws of nature, systematically transform nature, and seize freedom and wealth from nature.

The "saddle shape" of 1957 gave us profound lessons. This was a great good thing, as it improved our understanding, made us realize the arduousness and long-term nature of the struggle between the two lines; and made us realize that even under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the struggle between the two roads and the two lines must continue, and there must be no relaxation at all. The situation of the Great Leap Forward this year has brought us new problems, and some new difficulties have also occurred. Some people were frightened by the difficulties and surrendered to the difficulties, becoming doubters in the Great Leap Forward. At this time, we educated Party cadres to bravely overcome all difficulties, and educated everyone to recognize that the existence of difficulties in work is a normal phenomenon. If there are no difficulties in work, it is equivalent to no struggle, and there is no need to carry out work, and there is no need for Party leadership! In this way, we organized an inspection team of about 150,000 people throughout the province to inspect water, fertilizer, soil, density, management and other work, establish opposition, uproot white flags, plant red flags, and eliminate third-class fields. In this process, we used the method of more, faster, better and more economical, and fought against the method of less, slower, worse and more expensive. The method of less, slower, worse and more expensive, reflected in the ideological field, is Right-leaning conservative thinking, which is a stumbling block on the road of socialist advance. Because we insisted on continuously struggling against Right-leaning conservative thinking, "not yielding an inch of ground when planting red flags" not only became the guiding ideology of the Provincial Party Committee, but also became the actual action of cadres and the masses throughout the province, which greatly strengthened the leadership of the Party and quickly implemented the Party's policies into actual work, ensuring the continuous leap forward of agricultural production.

The Revolutionary Spirit of the People
is the Guarantee for Completing Various Tasks

The old society left Gansu people with economic poverty and backwardness. The same was true in agriculture. Through several years of work, although we have completed various social reforms throughout the province and made economic progress, the lives of the broad masses of people are not very prosperous. In 1957, the average person had no more than 700 jin of grain. This could neither increase a lot of accumulation for expanded reproduction, nor greatly improve people's living standards. After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the call for the people of the whole country to work hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of various regions, the encouragement to us was very great. At that time, we realized that the burden on our shoulders was very heavy, but we still had the confidence to realize this glorious task. This confidence comes from Chairman Mao's teachings to us. Chairman Mao said: "In addition to other characteristics, the salient feature of China's 600 million people is poverty and blankness. These seem like bad things, but they are actually good things. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burdens, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." This gave us great ideological inspiration. It taught us to firmly grasp the revolutionary spirit of the masses of people, the most dynamic factor, and rely on this force to complete the great socialist cause, because the revolutionary will of millions of people is the fundamental guarantee for completing various tasks. This enabled us to deeply understand the theoretical and practical significance of the mass line that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have often instructed us to implement. During the second session of the Provincial Party Congress, we formulated a plan to fundamentally change the face of Gansu through three years of hard work, and boldly shortened the time for realizing water conservancy from ten years to three years. The reason we had this courage was because we saw the hope that millions of people have yearned for for many years to change the economic situation. Gansu is a poorer and blanker area, and the people have a stronger revolutionary spirit. The Provincial Party Committee educated Party organizations at all levels and all Party cadres that in implementing this plan, they must closely rely on the masses, think about what the masses want to think, say what the masses want to say, do what the masses want to do, and support any enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, we also educated cadres that to rely on the masses, they must sincerely believe in the masses, and they must know that the wishes and actions of the broad masses of people are in line with the laws of social development, and leading cadres must reflect this objective existence and adapt to this objective law in their thinking and work methods.

From the high tide of the Great Leap Forward that began to form in October last year to the present, countless facts have eloquently proven the great power of the truth of the mass line. Through the nationwide rectification movement in the countryside, mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, put up big-character posters, and launch big debates, the broad masses of people rose up and stood with the Party to smash the attacks of the Rightist elements, defeat various Right-leaning conservative ideas, and raise their communist awareness in the struggle, setting off a high tide of agricultural production. Because the Provincial Party Committee put forward the agricultural production increase movement centered on building water conservancy and overcoming the threat of drought, reflecting the wishes and demands of the broad masses of farmers for many years, the farmers used double the strength to create miracles that people in the past dared not imagine, to answer the Party's care for them. The masses not only dared to let water go up the mountains, but also dared to build the 2,000-li-long "mountain canal" - the Tao River project. This year, the original plan was to build 3 million mu of new irrigated land, but after mass discussions, the plan has been rising linearly, increasing to 15 million mu, and now 17.77 million mu have been completed, and the entire province can realize water conservancy next year. This is also one year ahead of the plan at the beginning of the year. The original plan for soil and water conservation work this year was to realize 10,000 "Dengjia Forts" and control soil erosion in an area of 40,000 square kilometers, but the result is that more than 15,800 "Dengjia Forts" have appeared, controlling soil erosion in an area of 50,600 square kilometers. Because Gansu Province has a small population and a lot of land, and poor technology, we encountered quite a few difficulties in the entire process of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, such as a shortage of people, money, technology, and materials. Whenever we encountered difficulties, we would discuss them with the masses. As a result, there was everything, and few people complained. Although we encountered many difficulties on the agricultural front this year, everyone did not reach out to the state for things, and overcame many difficulties mainly through self-reliance.

In order to enable the broad masses of cadres and the masses to maintain frequent contact, to be able to understand the difficulties of the masses in a timely manner, and to discover and promote the inventions and creations of the masses in a timely manner, we vigorously carried out the work of cadres participating in physical labor and cadres planting experimental fields. More than 14,700 cadres throughout the province went down to participate in labor, of which more than 7,700 participated in agricultural production labor. Through participating in physical labor, not only were the thoughts of the cadres transformed, but also the relationship between the cadres and the masses was strengthened, and the relationship between the leading organs and the masses was consolidated and strengthened. Cadres of organs below the county level throughout the province, 70% of them planted more than 110,000 mu of experimental fields with the masses, releasing many "satellites." On the one hand, through experimental fields, models were established, superstitions were broken, and the thoughts of cadres and the masses were liberated; on the other hand, cadres were transformed from laymen into experts, which has an important role in implementing the mass line. Cadres participating in physical labor and planting experimental fields with the masses established an equal communist relationship with the masses and increased mutual trust. This is an important part of implementing the mass line, so we have adhered to this system.

Continuous Revolution Can Continuously Achieve Victory

Continuously putting forward new tasks for agricultural production, continuously carrying out agricultural technical revolution, and continuously using new battle slogans to inspire the masses are also one of the fundamental guarantees for our grain harvest this year. We communists are people who are constantly carrying out revolution, people who are never satisfied with existing achievements, and people who are always moving from one victory to another. Because Gansu has frequent droughts, barren mountains, a dry climate, serious soil erosion, and low grain yields, the task of transforming nature for the people of Gansu is particularly arduous. In order to change the face of nature as soon as possible, our province has fully paid attention to the issue of continuous revolution when formulating agricultural production plans, determining the key tasks for each period, or putting forward specific tasks in one aspect. In the water conservancy construction cause in recent years, the level of water conservancy has gradually improved from plains to high mountains, from partial governance to overall planning, and from simple irrigation to comprehensive (including power generation and shipping) utilization. Now, the "mountain canal" being rushed by 160,000 people is the crystallization of the continuous revolution in the water conservancy cause. The completion of this project will not only solve the irrigation problem of 15 million to 20 million mu of land, but also generate a large amount of electricity to help rural areas achieve electrification, and can also be navigable. More importantly, it can fundamentally change the climate of arid areas. The same is true in soil and water conservation work. Now, areas throughout the province that have completed soil and water conservation work have begun to cut mountains and fill ditches, connect land into pieces, and build horizontal terraced fields, creating conditions for irrigation and mechanized farming in mountainous areas. This practice of improving step by step and putting forward new goals step by step is an effective measure for carrying out continuous revolution towards nature. The broad masses of farmers support this practice, because they see a better future from here and increase their determination and perseverance to overcome nature.

The continuous revolution in agricultural technology has also brought reliable guarantees for grain harvest. The history of Gansu with its vast land and sparse population, frequent droughts and disasters has left many backward habits in agricultural technology. Due to extensive planting and thin harvesting, coarse farming habits such as not deep plowing, little fertilization, and not dense planting have emerged. Without changing this backward situation, even if water conservancy is built, production cannot be increased greatly. In the past, we had noticed the revolution in agricultural technology, but the momentum was not strong. This year, the Provincial Party Committee especially emphasized and put forward the specific content of this revolution. As a result, the two-ox plowing method that has been used for thousands of years has been replaced by 7 million new-style agricultural tools. The amount of fertilizer applied has also increased significantly compared to the past, and summer and autumn crops have generally achieved three irrigations and four fertilizations or four irrigations and five fertilizations. The planting area of improved varieties has been significantly expanded. These reforms have a decisive significance for increasing yield per unit area. The average yield per mu of 1 million mu of spring wheat and 4 million mu of autumn grain in the province is 1,000 jin, creating a record for large-area high-yield, which is the result of continuously carrying out agricultural technical revolution.

The above-mentioned aspects are the basic experiences and understandings of our leadership in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Of course, there are other aspects of experience, such as strengthening planning, organizing comprehensive collaboration, establishing typical examples to promote the general, organizing mass comparisons and inspections, and strengthening the construction of Party grassroots organizations to give full play to their role, all of which have played a significant role in ensuring this year's grain increase.

Strive to Achieve an Average Yield of 1,000 Jin Per Mu Next Year

Now, the 13 million people of the province are consolidating their existing victories and continuing to move forward. Now, nearly a million labor armies have embarked on the steel front, millions of people are working hard to develop 40 million mu of deep plowing land, 160,000 strong young men and women are fighting on the Tao River construction site, a fertilizer accumulation movement is being widely carried out in rural areas, various places are harvesting autumn crops, hundreds of unfinished water diversion projects are being accelerated, and a large number of farmers are moving to newly opened factories and mines. At this time, a shortage of labor has appeared throughout the province, which is a gratifying phenomenon, and it proves that the high tide of socialist construction in Gansu is still developing forward. The whole province has been people's communalized, which will further give full play to labor potential and complete more work. At present, our task is to further strengthen the leadership of the people's communes, strengthen the leadership of steel production, and strengthen the leadership of preparations for agricultural production next year. We are determined and confident to achieve more brilliant victories in these areas. I remember that at the beginning of this year, the "autumn accounting faction" was waiting for the autumn harvest to settle accounts with us, but today these people are silent in the face of ironclad facts. Now, it is possible that some people are arranging our outcome for next year, waiting for us to appear in a "saddle shape" in agricultural production again next year. It is certain that this expectation is in vain. While grasping steel production, the Provincial Party Committee is preparing for agricultural production next year on the basis of the people's communalization, formulating specific indicators and measures for water, fertilizer, soil, density, seed, and management, preparing for a major battle this winter and next spring, and ensuring that grain production next year will double again on the basis of this year, striving to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. As long as we continue to adhere to putting politics in command, follow the mass line, and continuously revolutionize, we will be able to achieve unexpected victories and make the lives of the people of Gansu more prosperous and better!

    依靠群众保证农业生产不断跃进
    中共甘肃省委第一书记　张仲良
    甘肃缺粮情况已根本改变
    甘肃省一千三百万人民，正万分兴奋地庆祝今年农业的大丰收。全省粮食总产量由去年的八十五亿斤增至今年的二百亿斤，净增率约140％。这一增长速度，在甘肃省是史无前例的。甘肃省解放前粮食总产量是三十九亿斤。1950年到1957年的八年过程中，粮食总产量增加了四十六亿斤，只等于今年一年增产量的40％。粮食的亩产量，1949年是一百零一斤，到1957年为一百七十五斤，增加七十四斤；今年亩产量一跃为四百零五斤，比去年增加二百三十斤，提前实现了农业纲要四十条“四、五、八”的指标。按每人平均粮食数量计算，1949年每人三百二十一斤，1957年每人七百斤，1958年每人平均有粮食一千五百四十斤，全省缺粮或粮食不富裕的情况，已得到根本改变。
    今年甘肃省粮食大丰收，是一个极为辉煌的胜利。这个胜利，是甘肃各级党组织坚决贯彻执行党中央的各项政策，高高举起毛泽东同志的旗帜前进的结果！这个胜利，是通过全民整风运动和反右派斗争，打退了右派分子向党的进攻，清算了党内右倾机会主义思想，巩固和更进一步加强了党的领导的结果！这个胜利，是全省人民积极贯彻执行八届三中全会、南宁会议、成都会议精神，破除迷信，解放思想，拔白旗、插红旗，树立敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义革命精神的结果！这一胜利，是我们积极学习各兄弟省各种先进经验的结果！
    几年来，甘肃省在农业生产上遇到的困难是非常多的。今年的粮食丰收，就是向各种困难作斗争中得来的。回顾过去走过的道路，现实斗争给了我们很多经验和教训，使我们对于如何正确地贯彻执行党的政策，全面地执行社会主义建设总路线，及早地实现由社会主义向共产主义的过渡，有了更深刻的体会。
    农业丰收是思想丰收的结果
    今年的农业丰收，乃是一次思想上的丰收。思想工作和政治工作永远是一切工作的灵魂和统帅。党中央和毛主席一直是这样教导我们的。在任何时候、任何一项工作、任何一个角落都贯彻执行这个指示，已经成为甘肃省推动各项工作不断跃进的无穷力量。思想是灵魂，政治是统帅，拔白旗，插红旗，就是要在各项工作中建立党的思想的绝对统治，就是要坚持不懈地向一切违反党的路线的现象进行不调和的斗争。甘肃农业生产的实践证明：客观上没有低产的作物、低产的土地、低产的自然条件；有的只是低产的领导思想和低产的落后措施。千条万条，党的领导第一条。实际斗争使我们从理性上和感性上完全懂得了“插红旗寸土不让”的伟大意义。这个斗争不仅反映在社会主义改造方面，而且也反映在改造自然方面，就是说“要革自然命，必先革思想的命。”
    回忆1955年秋季以前，当“甘肃落后论”者强调甘肃落后，有意抹杀人民群众革命干劲，使农业合作化事业裹足不前的时候，农业生产发展速度是缓慢的。由于“甘肃落后论”者用反动的形而上学的观点去观察事物，不懂得经济落后地区的人民是革命性最强的人民这个辩证关系，所以总是夸大客观事物中不利于革命工作的一面，企图否定改造社会和改造自然过程中党的领导作用和人的主观能动作用。我们向这种倾向展开了斗争。这场斗争，在理论上是辩证唯物主义向形而上学的唯心主义的斗争；在革命实践上是前进向后退的斗争。当这种右倾机会主义思想受到批判以后，全省马上出现了社会主义改造的高潮，接着掀起了农业生产的高潮，兴修水地四百三十多万亩，增产粮食二十六亿斤，净增率31％，创造了粮食增产新纪录。但是，这次的思想革命没有持续下来，斗争的不够彻底，为时不久，党内的右派分子和社会上的右派分子勾结起来，想否定我们的成绩。他们吹毛求疵地寻找我们工作中个别缺点和错误，大加攻击，说我们这也不好，那也不对，各项工作都冒进了，向党展开猛烈的进攻，给实际工作造成了极大的困难。结果，1957年农业生产的任务分配不下去，粮食总产量没有增加多少，出现了农业生产上的“马鞍形”。全民整风和反右派斗争，特别是贯彻八届三中全会和成都会议精神以后，批判了各种右倾保守思想，人们破除了迷信，解放了思想，树立了共产主义的革命精神，在全省范围内更猛烈地掀起了波澜壮阔的社会主义高潮。农业战线上展开了以水利为中心巨大的向大自然进军的运动。只以水利为例，原计划修水地一千五百万亩，而现在已完成一千七百七十七万亩，等于解放前水地的三点八倍，等于解放后至1957年八年间新修水地的二倍多。随着武山东梁渠之后出现的五千余条引水上山渠道，长二千多华里的引洮工程，标志着我省水利事业的新阶段，标志着甘肃人民已经从宿命论的束缚下解放出来，不再等待大自然的赐与，不再是自然界的奴隶，而是自然界的主人，已能够自觉地发挥人在自然面前的主观能动作用，研究和掌握自然的规律，对大自然进行系统的改造，从大自然那里夺取自由，夺取财富。
    1957年的“马鞍形”给我们的教训是深刻的。这却是一件大好事，它使我们提高了认识，使我们认识到两条路线的斗争的艰苦性和长期性；使我们认识到纵然在大跃进的形势下，两条道路和两条路线的斗争仍是要继续下去，丝毫不能有所放松。今年大跃进的形势，给我们带来新的问题，也发生了某些新的困难。有的人被困难吓倒，向困难投降，成了大跃进中的怀疑派。这时，我们教育全党干部要勇敢地去克服一切困难，教育大家要认识到工作中存在困难是正常的现象，如果工作中没有困难，等于没有斗争，也就不需要进行工作，也就不需要党的领导了！这样，我们在全省范围内组织了约有十五万人参加的检查团，检查了水、肥、土、密、管等工作，树立对立面，拔白旗、插红旗，消灭三类田。在这个过程中，我们用多快好省的做法，斗倒少慢差费的做法。少慢差费的做法，反映在思想领域中，就是右倾保守思想，是社会主义前进道路上的绊脚石。由于我们坚持不断地向右倾保守思想作斗争，“插红旗寸土不让”不但成了省委的指导思想，而且成为全省干部和人民群众的实际行动，这就大大的加强了党的领导，迅速把党的政策贯彻到实际工作中去，保证了农业生产不断地跃进。
    人民群众的革命性
    是完成各项事业的保证
    旧社会给甘肃人民留下了经济上的贫困和落后。农业方面也是如此。经过几年来的工作，虽然我们在全省内完成了各种社会改革，经济上有了发展，而广大人民的生活并不是很富裕的。1957年每人平均粮食不过七百斤。既不能给扩大再生产增加很多的积累，更不能大大提高人民的生活水平。党中央和毛主席提出全国人民苦战三年根本改变各地区的面貌的号召以后，给我们的鼓励是很大的。当时，我们意识到放在我们肩上的担子是很重的，然而我们仍然有实现这一光荣任务的信心。这个信心，来自毛主席对我们的教导。毛主席说：“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”这给我们思想上的启发很大。就是教给我们要紧紧抓住人民群众的革命性这一最富有生命力的因素，依靠这个力量去完成社会主义丰功伟业，因为千百万群众的革命意志，就是完成各项事业的根本保证。这使我们深刻领会到党中央和毛主席经常指示我们贯彻群众路线的理论意义和实践意义。在省党代表大会第二次会议期间，我们制订出苦战三年根本改变甘肃面貌的计划，大胆地把实现水利化时间由十年缩短到三年。我们所以有这个胆量，是因为我们看到了千百万群众多年来一直向往改变经济面貌的希望。甘肃是个更穷更白的地区，人民就更具有强烈的革命性。省委教育各级党的组织和全党的干部，在执行这个计划时，必须紧紧依靠群众，想群众要想的事情，说群众要说的话，做群众要做的事，支持群众任何积极性。同时，我们还教育干部，要想依靠群众必须衷心的相信群众，要知道广大人民群众的愿望和行动是符合社会发展规律的，领导干部就是要在思想上、工作方法上反映出这个客观存在，适应这个客观规律。
    从去年10月间开始形成的大跃进的高潮到现在，无数事实雄辩的证明走群众路线这个真理的伟大力量。通过农村全民性整风运动，发动群众大鸣大放，贴大字报，展开大辩论的结果，广大群众起来和党站在一起粉碎了右派分子的进攻，打垮了各种右倾保守思想，在斗争中提高了共产主义觉悟，掀起了农业生产大跃进的高潮。由于省委提出兴修水利、战胜干旱威胁为中心的农业增产运动，反映了广大农民多年来的愿望与要求，农民们用加倍的力量创造了过去人们不敢想像的奇迹，来回答党对他们的关怀。群众不仅敢于让水上山，而且敢于修建长达二千华里的“山上运河”——洮河工程。今年原计划新建水地三百万亩，经过群众讨论，计划一直是直线上升，增加到一千五百万亩，现在完成了一千七百七十七万亩，明年全省即可实现水利化。这又比年初的计划提前了一年。水土保持工作，原计划今年实现一万个“邓家堡”，控制水土流失面积四万平方公里，结果现在出现了一万五千八百多个“邓家堡”，控制水土流失面积五万零六百平方公里。由于甘肃省人口少，土地多，技术差，在整个农业大跃进的过程中，我们遇到的困难是相当多的，如缺人、缺钱、缺技术、缺材料，每遇到困难我们就要给群众去讨论。结果什么都有，很少有人叫苦。今年在农业战线上虽遇到很多困难，大家却没有伸手向国家要东西，以自力更生为主地克服了许多困难。
    为了使广大干部和群众保持经常的联系，能够及时了解群众的困难，及时发现与推广群众中的发明创造，我们大力开展了干部参加体力劳动，干部种试验田的工作。全省下放劳动干部一万四千七百多人，其中有七千七百多人参加了农业生产劳动。经过参加体力劳动，不仅改造了干部的思想，而且密切了干部与群众的关系，巩固和加强领导机关与群众的关系。全省县级以下机关干部，70％的人同群众一起种了试验田十一万多亩，放出了很多“卫星”。一方面经过试验田，树立了榜样，破除了迷信，解放了干部和群众的思想；另一方面，干部由外行变成了内行，对贯彻群众路线有着重要的作用。干部参加体力劳动，同群众一起种试验田，与群众建立了共产主义的平等关系，增加相互间的信任，这是贯彻群众路线的重要组成部分，因此我们坚持了这种制度。
  不断革命就能不断取得胜利
    不断地提出农业生产的新任务，不断地进行农业技术革命，不断地用新的战斗口号去鼓舞群众，也是我们今年粮食丰收的根本保证之一。我们共产党人是不断进行革命的人，是永远不满足现有成就的人，是永远由一个胜利走向另一个胜利的人。由于甘肃旱灾频繁、童山秃岭、气候干燥、水土流失严重，粮食产量低，甘肃人民改造大自然的任务特别艰巨。为了尽快地改变自然面貌，我省在制定农业生产规划，确定每个时期的工作重点，或提出一个方面的具体任务时，都充分注意到不断革命这个问题。几年来在水利建设事业上，从平川到高山，从局部治理到整体规划，从单纯灌溉到综合（包括发电、航运）利用，逐步提高了水利化的水平。现在，由十六万人正在突击挖凿的“山上运河”，就是水利事业不断革命的结晶。这个工程的完成，不但解决一千五百万到二千万亩的土地灌溉问题，而且可以发出大量的电，帮助农村实现电气化，还可以通航，更重要的是能够根本改变干旱地区的气候。在水土保持工作上也是如此。现在，全省完成水土保持工作的地区，已经开始削山填沟、土地连片、大修水平梭田，为山区的灌溉和机耕创造条件。这种步步提高、步步提出新的目标的做法，是向大自然进行不断革命的有效措施。广大农民是拥护这种做法的，因为他们从这里看到了更美好的未来，增加了战胜自然的决心和毅力。
    农业技术上的不断革命，也给粮食丰收带来了可靠的保证。甘肃地广人稀、干旱多灾的历史，给农业技术留下了不少落后的习惯。由于广种薄收，产生了不深耕、施肥很少、不密植等耕作粗放习惯。不改变这种落后状况，虽兴修水利，仍然不能大量增产。过去，我们曾注意到农业技术的革命，但声势不壮。今年，省委特别强调提出了这方面的革命。我们根据节气、作物生长的状况，不断提出这方面革命的具体内容。结果，几千年来一直沿用的二牛抬杠已被七百万个新式农具代替了。施肥量也比过去大量的增加了，夏秋作物一般作到了三水四肥或四水五肥。优良品种的种植面积有了显著的扩大。这些改革，对提高单位面积产量具有决定意义。全省有一百万亩春小麦、四百万亩秋粮平均亩产千斤，创大面积丰产纪录，这是不断进行农业技术革命的结果。
    前述的几个方面，就是我们领导农业生产大跃进的基本经验和体会。当然，其他方面的经验还是有的，如加强规划，组织全面的协作，树立典型推动一般，组织群众性的评比检查，加强党基层组织的建设充分发挥其作用等，对保证今年粮食增产都曾发挥了不小的作用。
    明年争取达到平均亩产千斤
    现在，全省一千三百万人民，正在巩固已有的胜利，继续前进。现在，近百万的劳动大军已走上钢铁战线，成百万人正在为发展四千万亩深翻地而紧张劳动着，十六万个强壮的男女青壮年战斗在洮河工地上，积肥运动正在农村中广泛地进行着，各地正在收割秋季作物，数百条尚未完成的引水上山渠道工程正在加紧施工，大批的农民正在走向新开办的工厂和矿山。这时，在全省各地出现了劳动力不足的现象，这又是可喜的现象，它恰恰证明甘肃的社会主义建设的高潮还在向前发展。全省已经人民公社化了，这将进一步充分发挥劳动潜力，完成更多的工作。当前，我们的任务是进一步加强对人民公社的领导，加强对钢铁生产的领导，加强对明年农业生产准备的领导。我们有决心也有信心在这几个方面取得更辉煌的胜利。记得今年年初，“秋后算账派”等着秋收后向我们算账，而今天这些人在铁一般的事实面前一声不响了。现在，也可能又有人在那里安排我们明年的下场，等待我们明年在农业生产方面再出现一次“马鞍形”。肯定的说，这种期待是白费的。省委在大抓钢铁的同时，正在人民公社化的基础上展开了明年农业生产的准备，制定了具体的指标和水、肥、土、密、种、管等措施，准备大战今冬明春，保证使明年粮食产量在今年的基础上再加一番，争取平均亩产千斤。只要我们继续坚持政治挂帅，走群众路线，不断革命，我们就能够取得预计不到的胜利，让甘肃人民的生活更加富裕，更加美好！
