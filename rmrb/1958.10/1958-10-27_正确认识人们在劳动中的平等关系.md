    Editor's Note: The following article originally appeared in the Shanghai "Liberation" bi-monthly magazine, issue eight. The situation mentioned in the article indicates that a few comrades have an incorrect understanding of communist society, believing that there is no need for leadership or any division of labor in a communist society. This is clearly a misunderstanding. This article elaborates on this issue and is worth reading.
    On the industrial production front, Shanghai, like other parts of the country, has seen an unprecedented Great Leap Forward this year. The foundation of this Great Leap Forward is the tremendous victory achieved by the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and the increasingly widespread understanding of Chairman Mao's doctrine on the correct handling of contradictions among the people by the vast number of cadres and masses. Many cadres have learned or begun to learn how to lead and manage socialist enterprises using the mass line method, and the mutual relationships among people in labor have improved. However, the further Great Leap Forward in production has revealed that the work of enterprise management lags behind the development of production, requiring a further implementation of the mass line in the leadership and management of enterprises. The key to further implementing the mass line lies in thoroughly breaking down the remnants of bourgeois rights and their ideological influence, and establishing genuine equal relationships among people in labor.
    From the perspective of factories and enterprises, the mutual relationships among people in labor mainly involve three issues:
    First, the relationship between leaders and the masses. Since the rectification movement, this aspect has greatly improved. Most leading cadres have shed their bureaucratic airs, relying not on prestige or officialdom but on in-depth personal example and political-ideological work, relying not on coercion but on persuasion, to carry out their work; boldly mobilizing the masses and allowing the workers to participate in the management of enterprises, thereby greatly arousing the enthusiasm and initiative of the workers. However, not all leading cadres have been thoroughly rectified, and not all bureaucratic airs have been completely eliminated. The work of workers participating in enterprise management has not only not been done well in all aspects, but is also insufficient in some areas. Some enterprise leaders are still not letting go or are not letting go enough. Therefore, this aspect needs to be further resolved.
    Second, the relationship between the leadership core of enterprises and departments, and the relationship between technical personnel in departments and the workers, is actually the relationship between technology and labor, science and practice, and management work and production work. The problem reflected here is still a mass line issue. Since the rectification movement, this aspect has also undergone many changes and is continuing to change. The situation of relying only on a few departmental technical personnel without relying on the workers, and the situation of departmental work being aloof and detached, divorced from reality, not caring about the interests of the workers, and not promoting the wisdom of the workers, which embodies the concept of bourgeois rights, has greatly improved. As a result, the work of departments has more effectively played a role in promoting production. However, this aspect has not been changed thoroughly, and the changes vary greatly among enterprises, so it still needs to be further transformed.
    Third, various rules and regulations that reflect and regulate the mutual relationships among people in labor. There are many problems in this regard. Some rules and regulations are not formulated based on the needs of production development, especially not from the perspective of promoting the enthusiasm and initiative of the workers, but rather inherit certain views of bourgeois rights, starting from managing people, and are also stipulated too rigidly. These unreasonable rules and regulations must be abolished, but have not yet been. Some rules and regulations were appropriate in the previous period, but have become outdated and no longer suitable for the requirements of further production development, and should be changed in a timely manner but have not been. However, although there are many problems, they ultimately boil down to a mass line issue. Since the rectification movement, cadres and masses have broken superstitions, their minds have been greatly liberated, and many unreasonable, outdated rules and regulations that hindered the development of productive forces have been broken and changed, changing the past phenomenon of overlapping organizations, bloated institutions, cumbersome procedures, and unclear responsibilities, promoting the formation of a Great Leap Forward in production. However, this aspect has not been changed thoroughly, and many problems still need to be further resolved.
    At the same time, based on Shanghai's practical experience, it can now be affirmed that the basic method for the leadership and management of factories and enterprises to follow the mass line is to implement cadre participation in labor, worker participation in management, and reform those rules and regulations that embody bourgeois rights and are outdated, under the collective leadership of the Party committee. This is what Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out as "two participations and one reform," and its basic content is to require the combination of leaders, technical personnel, and workers. It is very clear that it is definitely not and cannot be the abolition of leadership, the abolition of departments, and the abolition of rules and regulations.
    However, some of our comrades do not like to specifically analyze problems and have generated some confused concepts, regarding all the mutual relationships among people in labor in our socialist enterprises and the rules and regulations that embody these relationships as bourgeois rights, wanting to abolish all departments and abolish all rules and regulations, thinking that this is the only way to be thoroughly revolutionary. In this way, they have actually negated all the achievements of our socialist transformation and socialist construction in enterprise management since liberation. For example, in order to "eliminate the name of management personnel" and "eliminate the boundary between cadres and the masses," the Wanguo Rubber Factory in Putuo District carried out a "great revolution" in the factory's organizational structure, changing all departments into service stations, hanging up a sign that read "Service Station for Production Workers," and the original cadres and department personnel were all called "service personnel," with each person wearing a badge on their chest with the words "Service Personnel No. ×." The Party branch secretary was Service Personnel No. 1, and the factory director was Service Personnel No. 2. Everyone was a service person, and according to the opinions of some comrades, labor should be the main focus, and business should be secondary. One of the main contents of labor was to make beds, fold quilts, and pour tea for the workers. As a result, the Party's leadership and administrative leadership disappeared, the division of labor in technical departments disappeared, and rules and regulations were abandoned. A workshop Party branch secretary in a factory wrote an article for "Liberation" magazine, believing that "the administrative organization in factories and enterprises is essentially a legacy of the bourgeois rights system," simply demanding the abolition of administrative institutions, believing that "if administrative institutions can be eliminated, it will be of great significance in eliminating certain contradictions among the people."
    It seems that three questions must be debated: First, is leadership necessary? Does having leadership mean it is bourgeois rights? Second, is division of labor necessary? Does socialism or even communism mean that there is no division of labor? Third, are rules and regulations necessary, and can all rules and regulations be fundamentally abolished?
    First of all, leadership is not only indispensable but must also be strengthened. Not only have classes not yet been eliminated, the class struggle in politics and ideology has not been extinguished, and the struggle with powerful enemies abroad is still a serious task, all of which cannot do without the proletariat's headquarters to organize and lead these struggles; moreover, accelerating socialist construction and the transition to communism is an even more complex task, and it is clearly impossible without strong political leadership and specific administrative work leadership. Our current emphasis on leading cadres shedding their bureaucratic airs, going deep into the workers, and eating, living, and laboring with the workers is to thoroughly break down the influence of bourgeois rights and establish the genuine equal relationship between leadership and the masses in communism. It is to improve leadership and strengthen leadership, to make leadership follow the mass line, and definitely not to abolish leadership. Even in the distant future, although classes are eliminated and everyone has communist ideas, there will still be three states of people: advanced, intermediate, and backward, and people will still need to organize to engage in the struggle for production. Therefore, there will still be a relationship between leader and led. There must always be a head in everything, "a snake cannot move without a head," how can anything be accomplished without a head or brain? Democracy and centralization are a pair of categories, the more democratic the more centralized. In the future, people's consciousness will be further elevated, democracy will become people's habit, to the point where they do not feel the existence of any democratic system, and centralization will similarly become people's conscious need, to the point where they do not feel the existence of any centralized system. But this does not mean that centralization does not actually exist. It can be seen that leadership is still indispensable. It is just that what kind of leadership should there be, and how should leadership be conducted, these are things that need to be changed according to the development of the situation. The situation of people taking turns holding social public office in the future, as pointed out by Lenin in "State and Revolution," will definitely occur. If there is no relationship between leadership and the masses at all, then there can be no question of "taking turns holding social public office." The situation in which certain people are fixed in leadership positions, while the majority of people are fixed in a position of being led, will certainly be eliminated. This is one thing; the division of labor between leadership work and general work will also exist, this is another thing.
    Secondly, is division of labor necessary? Should departments be abolished? First, our current advocacy of department technical personnel going down to workshops to participate in physical labor has two meanings: one is because some department technical personnel's bourgeois stance and views have not been well transformed, and some old cadres who have been tempered by revolutionary struggle for a long time are inevitably still shrouded in certain influences of bourgeois rights. Having them go down to workshops to participate in physical labor is to make them transform their thinking through labor practice and by undergoing the education of the workers; the other is that the division of labor between department technical personnel and workers, one being indirect producers and the other being direct producers, there must be contradictions between these two. However, the main task of factories and enterprises is to do a good job in production, so the technical work of departments must serve production and serve the workers who are directly engaged in production. Having them go down to the workshops to participate in labor is to make them familiar with production conditions and the thinking of the workers, to resolve contradictions, and to better play the role of the technical work of departments. Both of these meanings definitely do not mean that we should abolish all departments now. Second, the situation of overlapping organizations and bloated personnel must naturally be changed, and management institutions such as departments must be streamlined to the minimum. But this must be subordinate to doing a good job in production. We definitely cannot immediately abolish all management institutions regardless of whether production can be carried out in an organized manner. Of course, in the near future, the division of labor between mental and physical labor, the situation where mental laborers are unwilling and unable to do physical labor, and physical laborers cannot and have difficulty engaging in mental labor, is definitely going to be eliminated. The kind of division of labor created by the bourgeois rights system, where everyone can only engage in a very narrow occupation, is also definitely going to be eliminated. Now, factories and agricultural communes are running schools, and schools are adopting the policy of combining education with productive labor, making workers and peasants knowledgeable and intellectuals workers and peasants, everyone is developing in the direction of becoming a versatile person, all of which will eventually completely merge mental and physical labor, and everyone will become "people who are capable of doing all kinds of things" (Lenin). Whether there will be a better form of organization in the future that is more conducive to production than the current department organization, of course, still needs to be explored in practice. But no matter what, the cause of production is always very complex, not only is there a distinction between industry and agriculture, but there are also all kinds of jobs, which must be carried out in an organized manner, and organization must have a division of labor. It is one thing for a person to be able to do this job and that job; it is another thing for a person to be assigned to focus on doing a certain aspect or several aspects of work within a certain period of time. Therefore, this meaning of the division of labor cannot be abolished, otherwise, production will be impossible.
    Finally, rules and regulations should never be immutable, and rules and regulations are by no means omnipotent. Any rules and regulations in factories and enterprises should be formulated, supplemented, and revised according to the development of production; suitable and reasonable rules and regulations can only play a positive role in organizing production when they are grasped by the masses and consciously implemented. However, reasonable rules and regulations must always exist. Reasonable rules and regulations must reflect the objective laws of the development of things, and are a necessary order suitable for their further development, summarized after reaching a new balance from imbalance. It is built on the basis of certain objective conditions. When conditions change, the balance is broken, the old order can no longer be maintained, so the original rules and regulations seem outdated, and must be changed accordingly, otherwise it will be detrimental to production and detrimental to social development. However, when the old balance is broken, a new balance and a new order must be established, so there must be new rules and regulations. What we want to abolish are those rules and regulations that are not suitable for socialism and communism, that are outdated and not suitable for the further leap forward situation in production. Our rules and regulations need to be constantly reformed, but definitely not fundamentally without rules and regulations.
    Of course, the ideological trend pointed out here is not only not the mainstream in the actual work of the entire Shanghai, but has only begun to emerge in the thinking of a small number of cadres in a very small number of factories and enterprises. However, "a storm arises from a puff of wind at the end of a green blade," this is a direction of the wind. If no attention is paid, this puff of wind may become a gale.
    At present, our country is in a period of rapid development where "one day equals twenty years." The situation is changing so greatly, so quickly, and so complexly that some comrades are eager to catch up with the situation, but lack the correct ideological method as a guide. They cannot follow Chairman Mao's teachings and earnestly conduct investigation and research, and use the theoretical weapon of Marxism-Leninism to make scientific analysis. Instead, they only grasp a few principles and only see some superficial phenomena, and then think that it is the truth. This makes it inevitable that they are prone to misunderstand the problem and do the wrong thing. It should be said that many comrades who advocate abolishing departments and abolishing all rules and regulations are subjectively aiming to thoroughly destroy the remnants of the bourgeois rights system and establish the equal relationship among people in labor in communism, and this is undoubtedly correct. However, "Any truth, if it is said to be 'excessive' ... beyond the limits of its actual application, can be turned into absurd nonsense" (Lenin). If people's thinking is lacking in a bit of dialectics, metaphysics will fill the void. If they do not seriously study dialectics, they cannot break the shackles of the metaphysical way of thinking, and they will inevitably commit this error pointed out by Lenin. Especially in this rapidly developing situation, we need to learn more dialectics in order to catch up with the situation. (This text has been slightly abridged by this newspaper)

### 正确认识人们在劳动中的平等关系

    正确认识人们在劳动中的平等关系
    编者按：下面这篇文章原载上海“解放”半月刊第八期，文中提到的情况表明：有少数同志对共产主义社会有不正确的理解，以为在共产主义社会里就不要领导，也没有任何分工了。显然，这是误解。此文就这个问题作了阐述，值得大家一读。
    在工业生产的战线上，上海也同全国各地一样，这一年来出现了空前未有的大跃进。这种大跃进形成的基础，是整风运动和反右斗争取得了极其伟大的胜利，毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说日益为广大干部和群众所掌握，许多干部学会了或者开始学会用群众路线的方法来领导和管理社会主义的企业，人们在劳动中的相互关系得到了改善。但是，生产的进一步大跃进，又显示出企业管理工作落后于生产发展的形势，便要求更进一步在企业的领导和管理上更进一步贯彻群众路线。而要进一步贯彻群众路线，其关键，又在于必须彻底破除资产阶级法权制度的残余及其思想影响，建立起人们在劳动中的真正的平等关系。
    从工厂企业来看，人们在劳动中的相互关系，主要有三个问题：
    一是领导与群众的关系。整风以来，这一条有了很大改善，大部分领导干部打掉了官气，不靠威风、不靠官架子而是靠深入的以身作则和政治思想工作，不靠压服而是靠说服，来进行工作；放手发动群众，让工人群众也参加企业的管理工作，因而大大地发挥了工人群众的积极性与主动性。但是，并非所有领导干部都已整风整得很好，并非官气都已去净；工人参加企业管理的工作，不仅并非都已做得很好，而且有些方面还很不够，有的企业领导上还不放手或者还不大放手。所以，这一方面还得进一步去解决。
    二是企业的领导骨干与科室之间的关系、科室技术人员与工人群众之间的关系，实际上是技术与劳动、科学与实践、管理工作与生产工作之间的关系。这里面所反映的问题，也还是一个群众路线问题。整风以来，这一方面，也有了不少转变，并且正在继续转变。那种体现资产阶级法权观念的只依靠少数科室技术人员不依靠工人群众的状况，和科室工作高高在上、闭门造车，不关心工人群众的利益，不发扬工人群众智慧的状况，都有了不少改善。因而科室工作便比较有效地发挥了促进生产的作用。但是，这方面改变得还不很彻底，各个企业改变得也颇不平衡，因而也还得进一步去加以变革。
    三是反映和规定着人们在劳动中的相互关系的各种规章制度。这方面的问题也很多，有些规章制度不是根据生产发展的需要来制定的，特别不是从有利于发动工人群众的积极性和主动性出发来制定的，而是因袭着资产阶级法权的某些观点，从管人出发，并且又规定得太死。这种不合理的规章制度必需革除，但尚未革除。有些规章制度在前一个时期曾经是合适的，却已不适合生产进一步发展的要求而变得陈旧了，也应当及时改变而尚未改变。但是，问题虽然很多，归结起来也还是个群众路线问题。整风以来，干部和群众打破了迷信，思想大大解放，许多不合理的、陈旧了的、束缚生产力发展的规章制度，被冲破了，改变了过去那种组织重叠、机构臃肿、手续繁琐、职责不明的现象，促进了生产大跃进形势的形成。但是，这方面的改变也还不彻底，许多问题也还得进一步去解决。
    同时，从上海的实践经验来看，现在可以肯定的，工厂企业的领导和管理工作走群众路线的基本办法是在党委集体领导下实行干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，改革那些体现资产阶级法权的和陈旧了的规章制度。这也就是邓小平同志所指出的“两参一改”，而其基本内容就是要求做到领导、技术人员与工人群众三结合。很明显，决不是也不能是取消领导，取消科室，取消规章制度。
    可是，我们有些同志不大喜欢去具体分析问题，产生了一些糊涂观念，把我们社会主义企业中人们在劳动中的相互关系以及体现这种相互关系的规章制度一概看作资产阶级法权，要把科室都一律取消，把所有规章制度都一律废除，以为只有这样才是彻底的革命。这样，他们便实际上把解放以来我们在企业管理方面的社会主义改造与社会主义建设的成果全部给否定了。例如普陀区的万国橡胶厂，为了“取消管理人员这个名字”，“消除干部和群众的界线”，就对厂里的组织机构来了一个“大革命”，把全部科室改为服务站，挂上了一块
  “为生产工人服务站”的招牌，原来的干部和科室人员都称为“服务员”，每个人的胸前别
  上了“第×号服务员”的字样，党支部书记是第一号服务员，厂长是第二号服务员。大家都是服务员，而且按照有些同志的意见，还要以劳动为主、业务为次，劳动的主要内容之一，又是为工人铺床、叠被、倒茶水等等。于是，党的领导和行政领导一古脑儿没有了，科室技术的分工没有了，规章制度不要了。有个工厂的车间支部书记写了篇文章给“解放”杂志，认为“工厂企业中的行政组织，实质上也是资产阶级法权制度的遗产”，干脆要求取消行政机构，认为“行政机构如果能消除，对消除人民内部的某些矛盾有很大的意义”。
    看来，有三个问题必须争辩一下：第一个问题，要不要领导？有了领导，是不是就是资产阶级法权？第二个问题，要不要分工？社会主义以至共产主义是不是便不要分工？第三个问题，要不要规章制度，能不能从根本上全部取消任何规章制度？
    首先，领导不仅不能不要，而且还必须加强。不仅现在阶级尚未消灭，政治上、思想上的阶级斗争并未熄灭，同国外强大敌人之间的斗争还是严重的任务，都不能没有无产阶级的司令部来组织与领导这些斗争；而且，加速社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡，是更其复杂的任务，没有坚强的政治领导和具体的行政工作的领导是显然不行的。我们现在强调导领干部要打掉官气、深入到工人群众中与工人群众同吃、同住、同劳动，是为了彻底破除资产阶级法权的影响，建立共产主义的真正平等的领导与群众之间的相互关系，是为了改善领导与加强领导，是要领导走群众路线而决不是取消领导。即令在遥远的将来，尽管阶级消灭了，大家都是共产主义思想了，但人们之中总还会有先进、中间、落后的三种状态，人们总还要组织起来从事生产斗争。因而就还是会有领导与被领导的关系。凡事总要有个头，“蛇无头则不行”，无头无脑怎么成？民主与集中是一对畴范，愈民主就愈有集中。将来人们的自觉性更进一步高涨，民主成为人们的习惯，以至不觉得什么民主制的存在，集中也就同样变成了人们的自觉的需要，以至不觉得什么集中制的存在。但这并非在实际上也不存在集中了。可见，领导还是不能不要的。只是应当有怎样的领导，怎样去进行领导，这是要根据形势的发展而有所变化的。列宁在“国家与革命”一书中所指出的将来轮流担任社会公职的情况一定会出现。如果根本不存在领导与群众的关系，也就根本不可能存在什么“轮流担任社会公职”的问题了。某些人被固定在领导岗位上，而大多数人被固定于被领导地位的状况必将消灭，这是一回事；领导工作与一般工作的分工也必将存在，这又是另一回事。
    其次，分工是否需要？要不要取消科室？第一，我们现在提倡科室技术人员都下车间参加体力劳动，有两层意思：一层是因为有些科室技术人员的资产阶级立场、观点还没有很好地得到改造，有些曾经长期受过革命斗争锻炼的老干部，也免不了还笼罩着某些资产阶级法权的影响，要他们下车间参加体力劳动，是使他们通过劳动实践和经受工人群众的教育来改造思想；另一层是因为科室技术人员与工人群众的分工，一个是非直接生产者，一个是直接生产者，这两者之间不能不有矛盾，但是，工厂企业主要是要搞好生产的，因而科室技术工作就得为生产服务、为直接进行生产的工人群众服务。要他们下车间参加劳动，是要他们熟悉生产情况、熟悉工人群众的思想，来解决矛盾，更好地发挥科室技术工作的作用。这两层意思，都决不是说现在就要全部取消科室。第二，组织重叠、人员臃肿的状况自然是必须改变的，科室等管理机构必须精简到最低限度。但这必须是服从于搞好生产，决不能不顾生产能否有组织的进行，而马上全部取消管理机构。当然，不久的将来，脑力劳动与体力劳动的分工，脑力劳动者不愿和不能干体力劳动，体力劳动者不能和难于去从事脑力劳动的状况，是肯定要消灭的。资产阶级法权制度所造成的每个人只能从事于非常狭隘的某种职业的那种分工，也肯定是要消灭的。现在，工厂、农业公社都办学校，学校采取教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，工人农民知识化，知识分子工农化，人人向多面手的方向发展，所有这一切，最后就将完全地使脑力劳动与体力劳动溶合起来，人人成为“能够作所有一切事情的人”（列宁）。将来企业生产的组织，是不是还会有一种更好的有利于进行生产的形式，来代替现在的这种科室组织，当然也还需要在实践中摸索。但是，不管怎样，生产事业总是非常复杂的，不仅有工业、农业之别，而且还有各种各样的工种，总得有组织地进行，有组织就必得有分工。一个人既可以做这样工作又可以做那样工作，这是一回事；一个人在一定的时间内被分配着重做某一方面或某几方面的工作，又是一回事。因此，这种意义上的分工就是不能取消的，否则，生产就将无法进行了。
    最后，规章制度决不应一成不变，规章制度也决不是万能的。工厂企业中的任何规章制度，都应当根据生产的发展来制定、补充和修改；适合需要的、合理的规章制度，也只有当其为群众所掌握和自觉执行的时候，才能够起积极组织生产的作用。但是，合理的规章制度总必得有。合理的规章制度，一定是反映事物发展的客观规律的，是从不平衡到达新的平衡以后所总结出来的一套适合自己进一步发展的必要的秩序。它是建筑在一定的客观条件的基础上的。条件变化了，平衡被打破了，旧的秩序不能再维持，于是原有的规章制度就显得陈旧了，就得相应地改变，否则不利于生产、不利于社会的发展。但是，旧的平衡被打破，总还得建立起新的平衡，新的秩序，因而也就还得有新的规章制度。我们所要取消的，是那些不适合于社会主义、共产主义的、已经过时了的不适合生产进一步跃进形势的规章制度，我们的规章制度需要不断地加以变革，但决不是根本不要规章制度。
    当然，这里所指出的这种思想倾向，在整个上海的实际工作中，不仅并不是主流，而且只是在极少数的几个工厂企业中，在一小部分的干部思想中，开始露了头。但是，“风起于青苹之末”，这是一点风向。如果不加注意，这一点风也许就会变成一股风的。
    目前，我国正处于“一天等于二十年”的飞跃发展的时期，形势变化如此之大，如此之快，如此之复杂，有些同志急于要赶上形势，却缺少正确的思想方法作指导，不能脚踏实地的按照毛主席的教诲，认真进行调查研究，用马克思列宁主义的理论武器来作科学的分析，而是只抓住几条原则，只看到一点表面现象，就以为是真理了，这就使他们不能不反而容易看错了问题，做错了事。应该说，主张取消科室、取消一切规章制度的许多同志，主观上是为了要彻底破坏资产阶级法权制度的残余，建立共产主义的人们在劳动中的平等关系的，而这一点无疑是正确的。可是，“任何真理，如果把它说得‘过火’……超过了它实际上所能应用的限度以外，便可以弄成荒谈谬论”（列宁）。人们的思想，辩证法少了一点，形而上学就会来填空子，不认真学习辩证法，就不能破除形而上学的思想方法的束缚，就免不了要犯列宁所指出的这种错误。特别是在这飞跃发展的形势下，我们就更需要多学点辩证法，以利于赶上形势。　（此文本报略加删节）
