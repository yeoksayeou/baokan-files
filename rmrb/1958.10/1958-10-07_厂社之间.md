	Between Factory and Commune
	Sun Yuedong

	The cadres of the Mianfeng Agricultural Cooperative Management Committee in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, want to write a letter to Chengdu Factory 402, reporting to the workers the unprecedented agricultural harvest their cooperative has achieved this year. Cooperative Director Zhang Sizhou has even set aside several tall cotton plants, ready to send them to the factory for the workers to see. They said: The cooperative's grain and cotton production increase plans have been overfulfilled this year. The worker elder brothers will be so happy to hear this!

	Zhang Sizhou, the director of the Mianfeng Agricultural Cooperative and a model cotton producer, and Yuan Zhixian, the chairman of the Chengdu 402 Factory Trade Union and an industrial labor model, are both deputies to the National People's Congress. Several years ago, on a trip to Beijing for a meeting, they shared a sleeping car on the Jinghan Railway train. Zhang Sizhou, who rarely had time to study, seized the opportunity to learn culture on the train, and Yuan Zhixian, who was more educated, acted as his temporary teacher. Thus, their friendship began. Later, they met frequently at various meetings. When they met, they talked intimately about production and changes. Whenever Zhang Sizhou went to Chengdu, he always came to see Yuan Zhixian.

	At the beginning of this year, the whole country was swept into the wave of the Great Leap Forward, and the Mianfeng Cooperative formulated its Leap Forward plan for the year. At the Fifth Session of the National People's Congress, Zhang Sizhou delivered a speech, reporting the cooperative's production Leap Forward plan. The plan was to achieve a per-mu yield of 800 jin of grain and 113 jin of ginned cotton on more than 4,400 mu of cultivated land throughout the cooperative, with the total annual output value increasing by one time compared to last year. At the time, Yuan Zhixian was very worried for Zhang Sizhou because he knew that the soil quality of the Mianfeng Cooperative was poor and the natural conditions were relatively poor. To have such a big leap forward was indeed not an easy thing. But Zhang Sizhou said to Yuan Zhixian with certainty: "We will definitely not fire empty cannons. We have found specific measures to increase production." Yuan Zhixian said happily: "That's good. If you encounter any difficulties in production, tell me, and we workers will definitely support you."

	In order to expand the scope of production and operation, the Mianfeng Cooperative decided to open various small factories this year. They bought an old car engine as a power machine. But in this remote rural area, the farmers had never even seen machines, let alone operate them. Zhang Sizhou raised this difficult problem during a meeting with Yuan Zhixian, asking for support from the worker comrades. Yuan Zhixian returned to the factory and discussed it with the leadership. The factory Party committee decided to send people to support them. After the workers saw the old engine bought by the Mianfeng Cooperative, they believed that it was not only low in horsepower but also very old and could not meet the needs. Everyone decided to repair another car engine themselves, and convert it to use charcoal as fuel, which was suitable for rural application, and send it to the Mianfeng Cooperative as a gift to support their Great Leap Forward. In early April of this year, with the help of the workers, both machines were installed, and the cooperative used machine power to open rice milling, flour milling, feed processing, and cotton ginning factories. Mei Zhongyun, a fourth-grade worker from Factory 402, also lived in the cooperative for a long time, helping five young cooperative members learn operating and repair techniques. Now, the Mianfeng Cooperative has also added a generator, which will soon be installed for electric lighting and industrial electricity.

	Under the Great Leap Forward situation, new changes have also taken place in Factory 402. Some of the workers' family members were unwilling to leave their hands idle in the nationwide Great Leap Forward, and they asked for an opportunity to contribute their strength to socialist construction. Because the factory itself had difficulty accommodating so many people, they mobilized them to go to the countryside to participate in production. As the flesh-and-blood friends of Factory 402, the Mianfeng Cooperative warmly accepted more than 40 workers' family members to settle in the agricultural cooperative in April of this year. When the workers' families first arrived, the cooperative members vacated their own houses for them to live in, lent them tables, stools, wooden beds, and other odd items; the cooperative also allocated grain and vegetables for them, and solved various difficulties for them as if they were receiving relatives, gradually acclimating them to rural life. In agricultural work, the cooperative also took care of them as much as possible according to their physical strength and expertise, enabling them to gradually get used to rural life. Chen Xiaolan, the mother of two children, was originally just an ordinary housewife. Since coming to the agricultural cooperative, she has actively participated in labor and has been praised by the cooperative members. She has been selected as the women's captain of the fifth production team.

	From then on, the Mianfeng Cooperative and Factory 402 became even more closely related, and their mutual support and cooperation became even closer. At the end of April, when it was time to transplant rice seedlings and set cotton seedlings, the Mianfeng Cooperative experienced a drought. The cotton seedlings were drying up and it was difficult to keep them alive, and the rice seedlings could not be transplanted. This was a decisive key: either overcome the drought, or let the Leap Forward plan fall through, one of the two must happen. All the cooperative members turned out, running a long way and using buckets to carry water to fight the drought. But the road was long and the water was scarce, which did not help. At this time, the news reached Factory 402. The workers found two old water pumps from the warehouse, rushed to repair them, and five people took them on a truck to the Mianfeng Cooperative, more than 100 miles away. They installed the water pumps, slept and ate in the mountains, and guarded the water day and night to fight the drought, and finally overcame the drought. Whenever the cooperative members talked about this, they said: "If it weren't for the help of the worker elder brothers, it would have been difficult to get such a great harvest."

	The Mianfeng Cooperative finally achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain and cotton. The cooperative averaged more than 1,000 jin of grain per mu and about 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu on more than 4,400 mu of cultivated land, overfulfilling the original plan. Cooperative Director Zhang Sizhou also remembered Yuan Zhixian's instructions, asking him to bring the tall cotton flowers to the worker comrades in the autumn to take a look.

    厂社之间
    孙跃冬
    四川省简阳县棉丰农业社管理委员会的干部们，要写一封信给成都402工厂，向工人们报告他们社里今年获得农业空前丰收的情况。社长张泗洲还特地留出几株高大的棉株，准备将来送到工厂里去给工人们看看。他们说：今年社里的粮棉增产计划都超额完成了，工人老大哥听了真不知道会乐成什么样子哩。
    棉丰农业社社长、棉花丰产模范张泗洲和成都4 02工厂工会主席、工业劳动模范袁志先，两人都是全国人民代表大会的代表。几年前，在一次到北京去开会的路上，他们两同住在京汉铁路列车的一间寝车里。平时很难坐下来学习的张泗洲，便抓紧时间在车上学习文化，而文化程度稍高的袁志先，就当了他的临时教师。这样，他们之间的友谊便开始了。以后，他俩在参加各种会议时经常见面。他们碰在一起，便亲密地交谈生产情况和种种变化。张泗洲到成都，总要来看一看袁志先。
    今年年初，全国卷进大跃进的浪潮里，棉丰社制订出了今年的跃进规划。在全国人民代表大会第五次会议上，张泗洲作了大会发言，报告了全社的生产跃进计划。计划今年全社在四千四百多亩耕地上，粮食亩产八百斤，棉花亩产皮棉一百一十三斤，全年生产总值要比去年增加一倍。当时袁志先听了很为张泗洲担心，因为他知道棉丰社的土质不好，自然条件较差，要有这样大的跃进，的确是一件不容易的事情。但是张泗洲却肯定地对袁志先说：“决不会放空炮，我们具体的增产措施都找出来了。”袁志先高兴地说：“那好，你们生产上如果遇到什么困难，告诉我，我们工人一定支援你们。”
    为了扩大生产经营范围，棉丰社今年决定开办各种小型工厂。他们买来一部旧汽车引擎作为动力机械。但是在这个偏僻的农村里，农民们连机器都没有看见过，更不要说操纵机械了。这个困难问题，张泗洲在一次和袁志先见面时提了出来，要求工人同志们支援。袁志先回到厂里和领导上商量，工厂党委会决定派人前往支援。工人们看了棉丰社买来的旧引擎以后，认为不仅马力小，而且十分破旧，不能适应需要。大家决定自己再修理出一部汽车引擎，并改装成用木炭作为燃料，适于农村应用，送给棉丰社作为支援他们大跃进的献礼。今年4月初，在工人们的帮助下，两部机器都安装起来，社里用机器动力开办了碾米、磨面、加工饲料、轧花等工厂。来自4 02工厂的四级工人梅仲云，还长期住在社里，帮助五个年青的社员学习操作和修理技术。现在，棉丰社还添置了发电机，最近将安装起来作为电灯照明和工业用电之用。
    在大跃进形势下，4 02工厂也发生了新的变化。一部分工人家属，不愿在全民大跃进中闲着一双手，他们纷纷要求有一个机会为社会主义建设贡献出自己的力量。工厂因为本身容纳这样多人有困难，便动员他们到农村中去参加生产。作为4 02厂血肉相连的朋友——棉丰社，在今年4月间以极大的热情接受了四十多个工人家属来农业社落户。工人家属初来时，社员们都腾出自己的住房给他们住，借给他们桌凳和木床及其他零星用具；社里还为他们调剂出粮食和蔬菜，还像接待亲人一样，为他们解决各种困难。在农事活路上，社里也根据她们的体力和特长，尽量照顾她们。使她们渐渐习惯农村生活。两个孩子的母亲陈小兰，原来只不过是一个普通家庭妇女，自从来到农业社后积极参加劳动，受到社员们的赞扬，已经被选为第五生产队的妇女队长了。
    从此，棉丰社与4 02厂更是结成了血亲关系，彼此的支援和协作更加紧密了。4月底，正是水稻栽秧和棉花定苗的时候，棉丰社发生了旱象，眼看棉苗干得难活，水稻也栽不下秧苗，这是决定性的关键：或者战胜干旱，或者使跃进计划落空，二者必居其一。社员们全体出动，跑很远的路，用水桶挑水抗旱。但是路远、水少，无济于事。这时，消息传到了402工厂。工人们从仓库里找出两架旧水泵，突击修理好，由五个人带着乘一辆大卡车赶往一百多里以外的棉丰社。他们把水泵安装好，自己在山头露宿和吃饭，昼夜守着提水抗旱，最后终于战胜了干旱。社员们每逢谈起这件事，就说：“若不是工人老大哥出一臂之力帮助，难以得到这样一个大丰收。”
    棉丰社终于取得了粮棉空前大丰收。全社在四千四百多亩耕地上，平均亩产粮食一千多斤，产皮棉两百斤左右，超额完成了原订计划。社长张泗洲还牢记着袁志先的嘱咐，要他秋后把又高又大的棉花拿来给工人同志们看看。
