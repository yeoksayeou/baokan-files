Why Can Graphite Crucibles Withstand Fire?
    Chuan Liu

    Steelworkers all know that graphite crucibles are the most heat-resistant. When you put a graphite crucible into a raging furnace to make steel, have you ever thought that this graphite, which only melts at a high temperature of 3800 degrees, actually comes from the same source as the burning coal? They are all carbon. This cannot help but remind people of the famous poem "Beans are boiled with bean stalks." However, the bean stalks can cook the beans, but graphite cannot be melted by coal fire.

    Why is this? Originally, in coal, carbon atoms are clustered together haphazardly and not tightly bound; we call it amorphous. The carbon atoms inside graphite are combined together in a very orderly manner, usually arranged in layers; it is crystalline. Like a well-trained army compared to a rabble, the fighting power between graphite and coal differs greatly. This is reflected in the significant difference in fire resistance.

    Due to the above characteristics of graphite, it is used to manufacture crucibles for metallurgy, as a coating for casting molds, as well as lubricant, coating, electrodes, etc. The lead in our commonly used pencils is also made of graphite. In the utilization of atomic energy, graphite also occupies an important position.

    Where does such useful graphite come from? It is formed under high temperature. In naturally occurring graphite mines, some are transformed from carbon dioxide separated from magma; the oxygen in the carbon dioxide runs off, and the carbon gathers together to become graphite; there are also those transformed from coal; coal or carbon-rich rocks, after being baked by magma, adjust the organization of internal carbon atoms and become graphite.

    Carbon forms graphite under high temperature, but why do charcoal and coal burn at lower temperatures, while graphite doesn't burn during the high-temperature formation process? This is because combustion is not determined by high temperature alone. For example, combustion requires oxygen. In the underground environment, carbon does not burn, but embarks on the path of becoming graphite, and sometimes even turns into something else, such as diamonds.

    It can be seen that to look at problems, we must comprehensively observe various conditions. The transformation from coal to graphite, and from fuel to refractory material, also illustrates that things in nature are not immutable, and can even transform in the opposite direction.

### 为什么石墨坩埚能耐火？

    为什么石墨坩埚能耐火？
    川流
    炼钢的同志们都知道，石墨坩埚最能耐火。当你把石墨坩埚放到熊熊的炉火中炼钢时，你可曾想到这要三千八百度高温才熔化的石墨，竟和正在燃烧着的煤源出一体？它们都是碳。这不禁使人想到“煮豆燃豆箕”的著名诗句。不过豆箕可以把豆煮熟，而石墨却不能为煤火所熔化。
    为什么会这样呢？原来，在煤里，碳的原子杂乱无章的聚在一起，结合不紧密，我们叫它非晶质。石墨内部的碳原子很有秩序地结合在一起，通常是成层的排列，是结晶质。就像训练有素的队伍和乌合之众相较量一样，石墨同煤两者之间的战斗力相差悬殊。表现在耐火上，也就有了显著的差别。
    由于石墨有上面这些特性，所以它被用来制造冶金用的坩埚、作为铸造模子的涂料，以及作为润滑剂、涂料、电极等，我们常用的铅笔心也是石墨制造的。在原子能的利用中，石墨也占了重要的位置。
    这样有用的石墨，是从哪里来的呢？它是在高温之下形成的。在天然产出的石墨矿中，有的是岩浆中分离出来的二氧化碳变成的，二氧化碳中的氧跑掉了，碳聚在一起成为石墨；还有就是从煤变成的，煤或含碳多的岩石在受到岩浆的烘烤以后，调整了内部碳原子的组织，成为石墨。
    碳在高温之下形成了石墨，可是为什么木炭、煤炭在不高的温度下就会燃烧，石墨却在高温的形成过程中没有燃烧呢？这是因为燃烧并不只是温度高一个因素所能决定的。譬如说燃烧需要氧气，在地下那种环境里，碳就没有烧起来，走上了成为石墨的道路，有时还变成别的东西譬如金刚石。
    可见看问题必须把各种条件综合起来观察，而从煤到石墨、从燃料到耐火材料的变化中，也说明了自然界的事物没有一成不变的，甚至向相反的方面转化。
