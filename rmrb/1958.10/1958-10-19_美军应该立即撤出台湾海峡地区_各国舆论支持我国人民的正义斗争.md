Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 16th: The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote: Washington is taking new measures to sharpen the situation in the Taiwan Strait area.

The newspaper pointed out that large quantities of weapons, including rockets, for the U.S. military and Chiang Kai-shek, are constantly being shipped to Taiwan. The newspaper wrote that although U.S. warships no longer escort Chiang Kai-shek's ships, they continue to intrude into Chinese territorial waters.

The newspaper said that Dulles, at a recent press conference, remained silent on whether the United States intends to withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait area and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. Based on the facts known so far, it can be concluded that Dulles' previous claim that the U.S. policy in the Taiwan area would be more "flexible" was merely intended to appease world public opinion. Because world public opinion is increasingly resolutely condemning the provocative actions of the United States. U.S. policy is causing increasingly strong unease around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Mexico News: The "Mexican Voice" published here condemned the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people in an article, and demanded that the U.S. military immediately withdraw from Taiwan in order to eliminate the threat of war in the Far East.

The article pointed out that the situation in the Far East has been very critical for more than a month. U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique it supports are attempting to prevent the Chinese people from recovering Jinmen and Mazu, which are only three nautical miles from the Chinese mainland. The war provocations being carried out by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek there are creating a war threat to the People's Republic of China.

The article condemned the outrageous provocative action of U.S. imperialism in supplying Chiang Kai-shek with Sidewinder missiles. The article pointed out that U.S. imperialism is attempting to force the People's Republic of China to abandon its right to liberate its own territory, in order to use the coastal islands of China to launch an attack on the Chinese mainland. The article finally expressed support for Premier Zhou's statement, which is: the United States must immediately stop playing with fire and withdraw its troops from the Taiwan Strait area.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th: The Calcutta "Amrita Bazar Patrika" said in today's editorial that Taiwan and the coastal islands should be governed by China, and the United States' basic policy toward China should be changed.

Commenting on Eisenhower and Dulles' recent talks on the Far East situation, the newspaper pointed out that they completely disregarded the opinions of the United States and the world. The newspaper said that due to such a position, "it is difficult to see where the Warsaw talks can lead." The newspaper wrote: "The Far East crisis stems entirely from this absurd position of the United States. It seems that the United States is still not prepared to change this attitude, therefore, there is little hope that the current tense situation will ease in the near future."

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Bangkok News: The "Universal Daily News" published an editorial on the 14th, pointing out that the Taiwan Strait issue is, in fact, China's internal affair. It is only due to U.S. intervention that all kinds of troublesome things have happened.

The editorial said that the United States will not have any peace by continuing to stay in Taiwan. The editorial hopes that the United States will change its wrong policy as soon as possible and demands that the United States withdraw its troops from Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th: According to TASS, Ottawa, 15th: The Canadian bi-monthly "Maclean's" published an editorial in its latest issue, calling for an end to U.S. aggression in the Taiwan area.

The magazine said: The situation in the Taiwan Strait is too dangerous to be ignored any longer. It pointed out: Jinmen and Mazu have always belonged to China, and China will never tolerate these islands becoming a springboard for aggression against the Chinese mainland. This is also something that no other sovereign country can tolerate.

    美军应该立即撤出台湾海峡地区
    各国舆论支持我国人民的正义斗争
    新华社华沙16日电　波兰“人民论坛报”写道：华盛顿又采取新的措施来使台湾海峡地区的局势尖锐化。
    报纸指出，供给美国军队和蒋介石的大批武器，其中包括火箭，源源不断地运到台湾。报纸写道，虽然美国军舰已不给蒋介石船只护航，但是它们继续窜扰中国领海。
    报纸说，杜勒斯在最近一次记者招待会上闭口不谈美国是否打算从台湾海峡地区撤出自己的武装部队和停止干涉中国内政的问题。根据现在为止所知道的事实可以得出这样一种见解：杜勒斯以前提出所谓美国在台湾地区的政策将更有“灵活性”的说法，其目的只不过是要平抚世界舆论。因为世界舆论越来越坚决地斥责美国的挑衅行动。美国的政策在全世界引起了越来越强烈的不安。
    新华社18日讯　墨西哥消息：这里出版的“墨西哥呼声报”在一篇文章中谴责美帝国主义对中国人民的挑衅行动，并且要求美国军队立即撤出台湾以便消除远东地区的战争威胁。
    文章指出，一个多月以来远东的局势非常危急。美帝国主义和它支持下的蒋介石集团企图阻止中国人民收复距离中国大陆只有三海里的金门和马祖。美国和蒋介石正在那里进行的战争挑衅，造成了对中华人民共和国的战争威胁。
    文章谴责美帝国主义供应蒋介石响尾蛇导弹这种猖狂挑衅行动。文章指出，美帝国主义企图迫使中华人民共和国放弃解放自己领土的权利，以便利用中国沿海岛屿来发动对中国大陆的进攻。文章最后表示支持周总理的声明，这就是：美国必须立即停止玩火，并且从台湾海峡地区撤出它的军队。
    新华社新德里17日电　加尔各答“甘露市场报”今天的社论说，台湾和沿海岛屿应当由中国治理，美国对中国的基本政策应当改变。
    这家报纸在评论艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近关于远东局势的谈话时指出，他们完全不顾美国和全世界的舆论。这家报纸说，由于这样的立场，“很难看出华沙会谈能够导向何处”。这家报纸写道：“远东危机完全源于美国的这种荒唐立场。看来美国甚至到现在还不准备改变这种态度，因此，目前紧张局势没有什么希望在最近将来趋于缓和。”
    新华社18日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”14日发表社论指出，台湾海峡地区问题实实在在是中国的内政问题。只是由于美国的干预，才发生各种各样麻烦的事情。
    社论说，美国继续留在台湾，将不会有什么安乐。社论希望美国及早改变它的错误政策，要求美国从台湾撤出它的军队。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社渥太华15日讯：加拿大“麦克林”半月刊在最近一期发表社论，要求制止美国在台湾地区的侵略行动。
    这家刊物说：台湾海峡的局势太危险了，不能再加忽视。它指出：金门和马祖一直是属于中国的，中国绝不会容忍这些岛屿成为侵略中国大陆的跳板。这也是其它任何主权国所不能容忍的。
