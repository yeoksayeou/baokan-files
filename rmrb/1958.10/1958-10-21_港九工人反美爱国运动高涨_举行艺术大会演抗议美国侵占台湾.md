Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 20th (Reporter Huang Wenfang): Starting from the 14th of this month, workers from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon held five consecutive days of drama, song and dance, and ballad performances centered on opposing the US occupation of Taiwan and the creation of violence in Hong Kong. This series of performances reflects the rising tide of the anti-American patriotic movement among Hong Kong and Kowloon workers.

A total of seven performances were staged, with over a thousand worker-actors and staff participating. The program included the drama "Blood Debt," which truthfully recorded the US bombing of the Hong Kong ships "Flying Goose" and "Moro" in Indonesian waters and the massacre of Hong Kong seafarers; the drama "Flames of Anger," which reflected the extreme hatred of Hong Kong workers towards US imperialism; the Cantonese opera "Hundred Ugly Pictures," which exposed the US instigation of secret agents to undermine the Hong Kong workers' movement; the dance "The Noose Around the Neck of the Warmonger," which demonstrated the inevitable demise of US imperialism; as well as a set of Cantonese songs "Anti-US Imperialist Occupation of Taiwan Suite" and three anti-American songs. Except for the last three songs, all the performances were collectively created by Hong Kong workers in their spare time.

In Hong Kong, workers could not find a decent performance venue. The seven performances were held separately on the rooftop platforms of seven trade unions. Some audience members sat scattered on the ground, while others climbed on the walls. The actors sang on very simple makeshift stages. However, the high spirits of the audience were unlike anything seen in any beautiful theater in Hong Kong. During the seafarers' performance of "Blood Debt" on the 14th, agitated worker-audience members constantly shouted slogans such as "Oppose the murderous US imperialism" from the audience. The indignation of the worker-audience and the worker-actors on stage merged into one, and the grand performance turned into a protest rally by workers against the US occupation of Taiwan.

Since Premier Zhou Enlai issued a statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait in September, Hong Kong workers have held hundreds of protest rallies and launched a widespread signature campaign against the US occupation of Taiwan. Workers from all walks of life have been singing anti-American songs and performing anti-American dramas and dances. The vast number of workers are using their limited spare time to take up pens and create artistic works with the theme of exposing the crimes of US imperialism. In September alone, workers created and performed four large-scale dramas, Cantonese operas, and more than a dozen Cantonese songs with anti-American themes. The dance "The Noose Around the Neck of the Warmonger," which reflects the inevitable demise of US imperialism, was collectively created overnight by workers at the Taikoo Dockyard on the third day after Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council meeting on September 8.

Currently, the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers against the US occupation of Taiwan is unfolding more widely and deeply, and the workers' anti-American patriotic sentiment is very high. After watching the grand performance, the workers returned to their respective trade unions and rehearsed the programs performed in the grand performance, preparing to perform them more widely in their own trade unions. Now, many workers have picked up their pens again and written more new anti-American patriotic works.

### 港九工人反美爱国运动高涨  举行艺术大会演抗议美国侵占台湾

    港九工人反美爱国运动高涨
    举行艺术大会演抗议美国侵占台湾
    新华社香港20日电　本社记者黄文放报道：从本月14日起，港九各业工人举行了连续五天的以反对美国侵占台湾和在香港制造暴行为主题的戏剧、歌舞和曲艺大会演。这次大会演反映出港九工人的反美爱国运动正在日益高涨。
    这次大会演一共演了七场，参加会演的工人演员和工作人员在一千人以上。会演的节目包括有真实地记录美国在印度尼西亚海面滥炸香港“飞雁”、“摩洛”两轮，屠杀香港海员工人事件的话剧“血海深仇”，反映香港工人对美帝国主义的极度憎恨情绪的话剧“愤怒的火焰”，揭露美国主使特务破坏香港工人运动的粤剧“百丑图”，表现美帝国主义必定灭亡的舞蹈“绞索套在战争狂人脖子上”，以及一组粤曲“反对美帝侵占台湾组曲”和三首反美歌曲。除最后三首歌曲外，全部会演节目都是由香港工人用业余时间集体创作出来的。
    在香港，工人无法找到一个像样的演出场地，七场会演都是分散在七个工会的屋顶露天平台上举行的。观众有的散坐在地上，有的爬在墙头上，演员们在非常简陋的临时舞台上演唱。但是，观众的高涨情绪，在香港任何漂亮的剧院里都没有出现过。在海员工人14日演出“血海深仇”的时候，激愤的工人观众不断在台下高呼“反对杀人凶手美帝国主义”的口号。台下工人观众和台上工人演员的愤慨情绪连成一片，大会演变成了工人反对美国侵占台湾的抗议大会。
    自从周恩来总理在9月间发表了关于台湾海峡局势的声明以后，香港工人曾经举行了数以百计的抗议集会，广泛地展开反对美国侵占台湾的签名运动。各业工人纷纷唱出反美的歌曲、演出反美的戏剧和舞蹈。广大工人利用自己有限的业余时间，拿起笔来进行以揭露美帝国主义罪行为主题的艺术创作。仅在9月间，工人就创作和演唱了四个以反美为主题的大型话剧、粤剧和十多首粤曲。反映美帝国主义一定要灭亡的舞蹈“绞索套在战争狂人的脖子上”，就是毛主席9月8日在最高国务会议上的讲话发表后的第三天，由太古船坞的工人连夜集体创作出来的。
    目前，港九工人反对美国侵占台湾的斗争正在更加广泛深入地展开，工人的反美爱国情绪非常高涨。观看了大会演的工人回到自己所属的工会以后，纷纷排练大会演上演出的节目，准备在自己的工会里更广泛地演出。现在许多工人又提起笔来，写出了更多新的反美爱国的作品。
