National Day grows more splendid year by year, and this year brings a new scene.
The Monument to the People's Heroes stands tall in Tiananmen Square.
The square is vast, a sea of people, the monument towering, dwarfing the sky.
Two suns appear in the human world, adding light to heaven and earth.
The cannons boom, shaking mountains and rivers, red flags and songs ripple across the land.
China has always had many heroes, but today's heroes are even more extraordinary.
A grand military parade is held every year, with all kinds of martial arts for peace.
To protect the fruits of the revolution, to protect the crystallization of construction.
The good tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, the unity between the army and the people is like a gentle breeze.
Now even division commanders and chiefs of staff are serving as soldiers, soldiers and generals embracing each other.
The higher the discipline, the greater the freedom, the stronger the leadership, the greater the democracy.
Looking at the three services with joy, lively and truly mighty.
Divine eagles fly in formation in the sky, far exceeding the speed of sound, traceable by electricity.
Flying silently from nothing, only hearing the thunder after passing.
Combining soldiers and civilians strengthens national defense, and peaceful construction consolidates the golden citadel.
We will not attack unless attacked; if anyone offends us, we will surely destroy the war criminals.
The masses of the people march in a grand parade, and red scarves are seen at the head of the procession.
Xiang Tuo taught Confucius at the age of seven, and now there are little teachers everywhere.
Workers, peasants, merchants, and students are all in formation, and the achievements of the year are unparalleled.
Cultural and art teams and sports teams are neat, magnificent, and striving for novelty.
Ten thousand white doves flutter in the air, and ten thousand balloons fly into the sky.
Below the balloons hang streamers, ten thousand slogans like poems.
Numerical targets rise like rockets, one day equals twenty years.
The People's Republic of China has existed for more than 20 million days.
Celebrating a bumper harvest of cotton and grain, no need to worry about food and clothing.
Steel waves surge and surge, mines boil and high-rise buildings rise.
Superstition is broken and many leaders emerge, and airplanes are created by students' hands.
No need to worry about missiles lacking intercontinental capability, airships are about to enter the moon.
Flying dragons soar through the clouds, twisting and turning, lions rolling balls, lively and fresh.
Peacocks are seen spreading their tails, and lotus-picking boats are everywhere in the streets.
People are lotus flowers, flowers reaching into the clouds, celestial maidens in the clouds longing for the mortal world.
Heaven and earth are a big stage, and all kinds of plays are presented in new ways.
The five lights and ten colors compete for splendor, embodying the national family.
Everyone shouts "Long live!" in unison, singing praises to the leader and celebrating peace.
Not only are the hosts overjoyed, but the guests are also intoxicated.
Not only are today's people greatly excited, but the ancients also have the intention of rejuvenation.
The base of the monument has bas-reliefs, each side vivid with real guns and knives.
Although the deceased have passed away for over a hundred years, we see today's leading figures.
Lin Zexu comes from the monument, Hong Xiuquan, Yang Xiuqing, Chen Yucheng, and Li Xiucheng all applaud.
Especially moved is Sun Yat-sen, whose eloquent tongue makes the lotus flower bloom again:
"The tillers having their own land was realized early, and the scourge of capital has returned to heaven.
Airplanes are now seen flying all over the sky, and railways and ships are no longer rare.
"A century of humiliation has disappeared without a trace, and foreign forces have been swept away.
I only hate that one inch of Taiwan's soil is still covered in a stinking mess.
"I want to scold Chiang Kai-shek severely, selling the country and himself in a despicable way.
Presuming to be a general with the characteristics of a hoodlum, how can the blue sky and white sun tolerate you!
"Your shamelessness exceeds Shi Jingtang, and your wickedness surpasses Zhang Bangchang.
You now inherit Wang Jingwei, recognizing the thief as your father and calling yourself a son-emperor.
"I ask you what you can be content with, serving as an accomplice for tigers and ghosts?
China has undergone great changes today, and in the midst of joy, I cannot help but feel ashamed for you.
"The people's spirit is as strong as the clouds, their fighting spirit is high, and their spirits are uplifted.
We will recreate the universe, and how difficult is it to recover Taiwan Province!
"American imperialism is a paper tiger, frost on the roof tiles, and you are willing to be a funerary object.
You are no longer Chinese, without a heart, liver, or five internal organs."
Mr. Sun Yat-sen's voice is high, flying into Taiwan Island with the wind.
Souls wandering in the cauldron, if they repent, it is the right time to jump out of the oil pot.
If you do not repent, it does not matter, anyway, the time is not long.
Taiwan compatriots are mostly patriotic and will also expel the US and Chiang.
The red flag is planted on Mount Ali, and the sun and moon shine again on Sun Moon Lake.
Eight million people are liberated together, and ten thousand voices shout "Long live!" in a surging tide.
The marching masses have a heroic momentum, and the gongs and drums shake the sky.
Hundreds of millions of flags reflect the sun, and the Yangtze River turns and the East China Sea collapses.
Suddenly, cheers are heard like thunder, and Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin all smile.
They all come down from the wall and become one with the masses.
The four mentors are forever young, and Lenin is publicly elected as the representative.
Ascending straight to Tiananmen, they shout "Comrades, how are you!"
"Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, your leadership is a good style.
You have developed Marxism, and the Chinese revolution celebrates success.
"There are contradictions within the people, and you teach us to launch great debates.
Contradictions promote new balance, promoting the people's great leap forward.
"To eliminate the division between mental and physical labor, education should set a new direction.
You make everyone equal, and 600 million people are of one heart and mind.
"The development of the times is reaching a climax, and you are now good at both destruction and construction.
Nine years of decay have turned into magic, and the West Wind has now been suppressed.
"You are extraordinary in revolutionary undertakings, and you use the countryside to surround the cities.
Construction undertakings have also been renewed, with red flowers blooming later and green leaves earlier.
"Splitting mountains and opening canals is known throughout the world, truly seeing great rivers rising above high mountains.
Eliminating the four pests makes people healthy and happy, and greening the four sides creates many terraces.
"Pinghu emerges everywhere from the mountains, mainly storing small groups.
The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and the Sanmenxia, reservoir projects are unparalleled in the world.
"The yield of rice is so amazing, it has been heard that the yield per mu is several tens of thousands of jin!
The people's communes are large and public, unifying workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers.
"New sprouts of communism, first blooming in the countryside.
Turning around to promote industrialization, steel and machinery straddle galloping horses.
"Steel production grows like the wind, and the speed is unimaginable.
This year it will surely exceed ten million tons, and in a few years, it will be hundreds of millions of tons strong.
"I have been to the exhibition hall, and the mechanical production surface is very wide.
Precision instruments surpass the UK and the US, and electronic computers replace abacuses.
"The Wuhan Bridge was built early, and the 'East Wind' goes straight to the top of the Kunlun Mountains.
Underground treasures are opened one by one, and soon we will see oil derricks become forests.
"The road is correct and the methods are high, combining production with large, medium, and small.
Implementing tiered management and diligent inspection, unified planning with leadership.
"Planting cotton and protecting peaches requires topping, and grasping the key points of overall construction.
Taking grasping the key points to drive the overall situation, remote control is unprecedented.
"A hundred flowers bloom in literature and art, and new talents emerge everywhere.
Folk songs are like a vast sea, and buildings rise from the ground in the blink of an eye.
"Science and technology soar like ten thousand horses, combining foreign and domestic methods in a bold and unconstrained manner.
Fully spreading the foundation is thick, and high-level breakthroughs emerge with sharpness and novelty.
"The people's living standards have greatly improved, each contributing their ability without seeking reward.
Every road leads to communism, and more, faster, better, and more economical is the guiding principle.
"Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, no wonder people sing 'The East is Red'.
You are the red sun in the East, and 600 million people are happy.
"The great Communist Party of China has a good undertaking of historical mission.
The democratic camp is united tightly, and revisionism is not allowed to be rampant.
"Sino-Soviet friendship is the core, uniting mankind to maintain peace.
Industry is about to undergo a great revolution, fully utilizing atomic energy.
"The road of imperialism is exhausted, and the final struggle is like a frenzy.
If they do not restrain themselves and eliminate them, they will promote the world to great harmony!"
As soon as Lenin finished speaking, the portrait was still on the wall.
The five mentors stand facing each other, with smiles in their ten eyes, silent.
World War II was a disaster, ending thirteen years ago.
How could the war end? Mankind thanks the Soviet Union in unison.
However, the scourge of war is still fresh, and there are still madmen playing with fire.
American imperialism is taking advantage of the fisherman's profits, with one hand holding atomic bombs and the other holding gold dollars.
Inheriting the old traditions of the Axis powers, self-proclaimed masters of the globe.
Military bases are everywhere, delusional to confine humanity in a cage.
The great revolution of the Chinese people, the victory of the red flag shows five stars.
Reflecting each other, the red October came first, and the proletariat exercised dictatorship.
Expelling American imperialism from China, the world strategy was broken.
The blockade is still unrelenting, but what can nine years do to me?
Far away in the western Pacific, a new crescent-shaped battle line is formed.
North from Korea to South Vietnam, I am the target of the blockade.
The longer the blockade, the stronger I become, and self-reliance increases strength.
I have grasped the initiative and have caused the enemy to be affected.
Moreover, there is a large democratic camp, with the Soviet Union as the leader, becoming more and more firm.
The forces of peace are increasing day by day, please see the red great satellite.
The madmen still do not realize it, supporting puppets and colluding with foxes and rats.
Occupying Taiwan and Penghu, and even Kinmen and Matsu.
Obstructing my entry into the United Nations, reversing black and white and wantonly slandering.
Saying that I am invading my territory, wanting the United States to protect him.
In the past, they committed armed aggression against Korea, and even attacked to the Yalu River.
The Chinese and Korean peoples fought together to resist aggression, and were defeated and retreated back to the 38th parallel.
This summer, they recklessly sent troops to West Asia, invading Lebanon for no reason.
The people of the world condemn it together, the old accounts have not been settled and new ones have been added.
War maniacs are always forgetful, putting the noose around their own necks.
The ends of the rope are being pulled by others, but they are still complacent and arrogant.
The gunboat policy is long out of date, and atomic blackmail is truly childish.
Delusional to scare the Chinese people, who knows that today is not what it used to be!
The problem is actually very simple, and the people of the world have seen through it early.
If Dulles does not control himself, he is a great war criminal.
American troops withdraw from Taiwan, not allowing a moment's delay.
Do not use Warsaw as a cover, no one can be deceived!
No more playing with fire and the fire will stop itself, warning the madmen to wake up early.
Interfering in China's internal affairs will inevitably be hanged sooner or later!
I have declared it long ago: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
Taiwan must be liberated, and North America is no longer a peach blossom paradise!
A piece of military music is melodious, and the Yangko dance is seen filling the square again.
Guerrilla warfare style of the New Eighth Route Army, the rural atmosphere is full of fragrance.
Three years of hard work have changed the face of society, and nature has been transformed together.
Please look east at Chang'an Street, the streets have extended out of the castle.
Just fifty days of hard work, a wide road appears before your eyes.
When National Day comes next year, high-rise buildings will reach the sky on both sides.
This is a new model for construction, and it is similar throughout the country.
A proactive spirit is higher than the sky, and the people's power is greatly liberated.
Many people have great strength, and concentrated labor is skilled.
Putting politics in command and inserting the red flag, all difficulties will be swept away.
Conservatism and waste have been opposed, and the masses dare to create and dare.
Dare to think, dare to say, and dare to do, the sun, moon, and five stars listen to dispatch.
The ancients said that Pangu created the world, and now Pangu is everywhere.
Worship the masses as teachers, and the masses will believe in you.
Advise the rightists not to hesitate, take the time to open their minds quickly.
The temperature of the times is hundreds of millions of degrees high, and it is bound to melt granite.
The past is like death yesterday, and the future starts from scratch.
Know that the kingdom of heaven is in the human world, and 600 million people are all gods.
What is the use of being indecisive? Do not delay any longer, do not be inferior.
Deeply plow the soil to increase yields, and deeply plow the mind to fertilize it well.
If you do not isolate yourself, you can be in a group, and time cannot be lost, even for a second.
Get rid of all dirt and be unburdened, reborn and become a new person.
Have you not heard that three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang?
Now 600 million Zhuge Liangs listen to the Communist Party of China.
Have you not seen that three people with one heart can break gold!
Now 600 million people with one heart, their strength exceeds the fusion of hydrogen!
With both democracy and centralism, the masses support with open minds.
Imperialism has become an isolated island, and Asia, Africa, and South America are all brothers.
The struggle between two roads, victory already belongs to us.
The choice of two methods, we have chosen more, faster, better, and more economical.
Everyone encourages each other to strive for the upstream, and there is a higher upstream.
Always follow the Communist Party, always follow the leader.
National construction is faster than sound, and the Yellow River and Yellow Sea are eternally green.
Celebrating National Day with joy every year, the universe is filled with songs of praise.
