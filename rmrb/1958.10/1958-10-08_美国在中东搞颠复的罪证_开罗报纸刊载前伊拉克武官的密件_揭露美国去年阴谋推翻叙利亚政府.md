(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Cairo’s “Al-Gomhouria” newspaper exposed on the 5th and 6th the U.S. attempt last year to overthrow the nationalist government of Syria.

On the 5th, the newspaper published a photocopy of an internal report written by Samadton, the former Iraqi military attaché to Beirut and Damascus, provided by the Iraqi military intelligence agency. On the 6th, it published another report written by the same military attaché in photocopy form. The former report, written by Samadton around March 1957, revealed that the American and British ambassadors were working under the pseudonyms of Rasafi and Karl H., names representing two districts in Baghdad where the U.S. and British embassies were located.

The report revealed that the U.S. and Britain had secret terrorist armed forces in Lebanon, led by the Chamoun regime. The U.S. and British ambassadors in Baghdad paid these forces 160,000 lira (Turkish pounds) per month.

Another report written by Samadton exposed that the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, using the alias Rasafi, plotted to launch a coup in Syria on April 17, 1957. After this plot failed, it was decided to make a second attempt during Eid al-Fitr (the Feast of Fast-Breaking), but this plot also failed.

The military attaché's report said that the U.S. ambassador controlled a large group of officers in the Syrian army, but he mistakenly trusted certain officers.

According to the report, the conspirators planned to collude with the illegal Syrian Social Nationalist Party and the commander of the gendarmerie to arrest fourteen civilian and military officials, and to form a provisional government composed entirely of so-called "neutral independents" headed by Majd al-Din al-Jabri.

The former Syrian Social Nationalist Party handed over all of its armed forces to Rasafi's control, ready to take action in Damascus upon receiving a signal.

However, this plot was thwarted because some officers were unwilling to carry out the arrests. They then decided to act at the beginning of Eid al-Fitr, but this plot also failed because these officers ceased their activities.

The report showed that the U.S. ambassador was eager to see the Syrian coup succeed, and he promised to pay his accomplices large sums of money, and had already paid them large sums of money.

Pravda commented on the U.S. subversive plot on the 5th, requesting that copies of the discovered documents be distributed to all national representatives stationed at the United Nations.

It said that the world should know about this direct and overt criminal interference by the United States in Arab countries.

    美国在中东搞颠复的罪证
    开罗报纸刊载前伊拉克武官的密件  揭露美国去年阴谋推翻叙利亚政府
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：开罗“共和国报”5日和6日连续揭露去年美国企图推翻叙利亚民族主义政府的阴谋。
    这家报纸在5日影印刊登了伊拉克军事情报机关所提供的前伊拉克驻贝鲁特和大马士革武官萨马顿所写的内部报告，6日又刊载了这个武官所写的另一份报告的影印照片。前一份报告是萨马顿于1957年3月间所写的，它透露美国和英国大使是以拉萨菲和卡尔赫两个假名进行工作的，这两个名字代表美、英两国大使馆所在的巴格达的两个区。
    报告透露，美、英在黎巴嫩有着秘密的恐怖武装，这些武装由夏蒙政权领导。美英驻巴格达的大使每月付给这支武装十六万里拉（土耳其镑）。
    萨马顿所写的另一份报告揭发，美国驻巴格达大使用拉萨菲的化名策划阴谋，企图在1957年4月17日在叙利亚发动政变。在这次阴谋失败以后又决定在开斋节作第二次尝试，可是这一阴谋也遭到了失败。
    这位武官的报告说，美国大使在叙利亚陆军军官当中掌握着很大的一个集团，但是他错信了某些军官。
    据这份报告说，阴谋分子打算勾通非法的叙利亚国家社会党和宪兵司令逮捕十四名文武官员，并且组成以马吉德丁·贾布里为首的完全是所谓“中立的独立人士”的临时政府。
    前叙利亚国家社会党把它的全部武装力量都交由拉萨菲掌握，准备一接到信号就在大马士革采取行动。
    但是，这一阴谋由于某些军官不愿意动手进行逮捕而遭到了挫折。他们就决定在开斋节开始行动，但是这次阴谋又告流产，因为这些军官停止活动了。
    这一报告表明，美国大使急于使叙利亚的政变获得成功，他答应付给他的同谋大笔金钱，并且已经付给他们大笔钱财。
    “消息报”5日在评论美国的颠复阴谋时，要求一定要把发现的文件抄本分发给所有各国驻在联合国的代表。
    它说，应该使全世界都知道美国对阿拉伯国家进行的这种直接的公开的罪恶干涉。
