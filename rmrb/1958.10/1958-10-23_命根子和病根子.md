    Lifeblood and Root of Illness
    Liu Rengan

    Once, people were debating the issue of "combining education with productive labor." One professor vehemently opposed this policy. According to him, if schools implemented work-study programs and half-work, half-study systems, it would inevitably "lower teaching quality" and "waste the time of young people." He said it was "treating university students as technicians" and was "shortsighted and deeply regrettable," appearing every inch the protector of youth and education. Finally, he even pounded the table with his hand in agitation, saying: "This is tantamount to digging up our lifeblood!"

    "Digging up the lifeblood"—is it really that serious? I thought perhaps the professor was exaggerating somewhat, which is to say, "overstating" things. But on second thought, this is indeed the professor's heartfelt sentiment, and it is spoken with great pain.

    For example, a group of people similar to this professor, that is, the bourgeois intellectuals, still exist as a special social class in our society. Then, where are its roots? As a class, its roots are of course connected to the exploiting classes; but isn't it the educational system that is separated from productive labor that has created them as such a special class? Now they say that this is their lifeblood, which can be considered a kind of "drinking water and thinking of the source, not forgetting its origin." Moreover, they also rely on it to protect their paper-mâché academic crowns and maintain their special interests, don't they? Therefore, they, like the intellectuals of the exploiting classes throughout history, desperately protect this "root," not allowing people to touch it, and certainly not allowing it to be dug up. Once it is dug up, they will naturally scream like pigs being slaughtered.

    Of course, this kind of root has a long history and was not created by them. As far back as the time of the "most holy teacher" Confucius, it already existed. He once rebuked his student Fan Chi as a "small man" because Fan Chi wanted to learn how to grow crops and vegetables. Mencius also insisted on the principle of "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others." However, the "science" of the Confucian and Mencian era was not as developed as it is today, so even though they were "most holy" and "great sages," they still couldn't find many scientific reasons to defend their views. In this regard, bourgeois educators and scholars are superior to their predecessors. They have found many "scientific" bases to prove the inevitability of the separation of theory and practice and that education must be separated from productive labor. For example, what "scientists have big heads and small hands, suitable for theoretical research; while workers and farmers have small heads and big hands, and can only engage in physical labor," or what "mental labor consumes protein, physical labor consumes starch, and people engaged in mental labor are not suitable for physical labor," and so on, and so forth. In fact, they understand that as long as the separation of mental and physical labor continues to be maintained, the boundary of high and low, noble and humble can be maintained, allowing them to live in a position higher than the general working masses. Although the working class has been emancipated economically and politically, as long as culture, according to the old social division of labor, remains in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals, they are still a valuable commodity: "You can't do without me." But once education is combined with productive labor, the difference between mental and physical labor, between mental laborers and physical laborers, will inevitably gradually disappear, everyone will be knowledgeable, and everyone will have to work. This group of people, as special figures, can no longer act as any "valuable commodity," and naturally lose their special value. For them, this is truly something that cannot be dug up!

    What these gentlemen regard as their lifeblood is, in our view, merely a root of illness, their root of illness, and also a root of illness for the entire education system and the entire society. Why have many experts and professors recently made fools of themselves in the face of reality? Being far from reality leads to pretentiousness; once they stand in front of reality, they reveal that pathetic appearance. Isn't this morbid? As for what these gentlemen themselves say, "big head, small hands," what is so valuable about that? As for its harm to society, causing the great disease of antagonism between people, there is no need to say more. Therefore, this root of illness must be dug up, and the Party's policy of "combining education with productive labor" is precisely to thoroughly eradicate this root of illness and plant the roots of happiness and health.

    The separation of education and productive labor is indeed a kind of root, and replacing it with new policies and systems is indeed digging up roots. The question is how to regard it as what kind of root? And how to treat digging up roots: is it to regard it as a lifeblood and desperately resist letting it be dug up? Or is it to regard it as a root of illness and welcome others to dig it up, while also actively digging it up oneself? This is the boundary between two kinds of people standing on different positions.

    命根子和病根子
    刘任敢
    一次人们辩论“教育与生产劳动相结合”的问题，有一位教授激烈地反对这个方针，据他说，学校教育一实行勤工俭学、半工半读，就必然“会降低教学质量”，“荒废青年人的光阴”；说这是“把大学生当成技工培养”，“目光短浅，深为可惜”等等，俨然是一副青年和教育事业保护者的面孔，正经得怕人；最后，他竟激动地用手砸着桌子说：“这等于挖掉我们的命根子！”
    “挖掉命根子”，果真这等严重么？我想也许是教授先生表演得有些过分，也就是所谓“夸张”的吧。但再一想，这的确又是教授的由衷之言，而且说得痛切得很。
    比如说吧，类似这位教授的一批人，也就是资产阶级知识分子们，仍然作为一个特殊的社会阶层在我们这个社会上存在。那末，它的根子扎在哪里呢？作为阶级的根子当然是连在剥削阶级身上的；但把他们造就成为这样一个特殊阶层的不正是教育与生产劳动相割裂的教育制度么？如今他们说这是他们的命根子，倒也算得是一种“饮水思源，不忘其本”。何况，他们还要靠它来掩护着纸糊的学冠，维护着特殊的利益呢？所以他们便像历来的剥削阶级的知识分子一样，死命地护持着这“根子”，不让人们去触动它，至于挖就更不允许，一挖，自然要杀猪般地叫起来。
    当然，这种根子由来已久，并非他们手创。远从“至圣先师”孔老二那时候起，就已有了的。他就曾斥责他的学生樊迟是“小人”，因为樊迟想学种庄稼和种菜。孟子也坚持“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的道理。不过，孔孟时代的“科学”，还没有如今的发达，所以虽是“至圣”和“大贤”，也还不能找出多少科学道理来，为自己的观点辩护。这一点，资产阶级教育家和学者们，是后人胜过先人的。他们为证明理论与实践分裂的必然性，教育必须同生产劳动割裂开，找出了许多的“科学”根据。比如什么“科学家是大脑袋、小手，宜于搞理论研究；而工人农民是小脑袋、大手，只能从事体力劳动”呀，什么“脑力劳动消耗蛋白质，体力劳动消耗淀粉质，搞脑力劳动的人不宜于搞体力劳动”呀，等等，如此这般，不一而足。其实，他们明白：只要继续维持脑力劳动与体力劳动的分离，就可以保持着高低贵溅的界限，而使他们安居于高出一般劳动群众之上的地位。工农群众尽管在经济上政治上翻了身，但只要在文化上按照旧的社会分工仍然掌握在资产阶级知识分子手里，他们还是奇货可居的：“你们离了我不行”。而教育和生产劳动一结合，脑力劳动同体力劳动、脑力劳动者同体力劳动者间的差别，势必逐渐消除，人人都有学问，人人都须劳动，作为特殊人物的这批人，再不能充当什么“奇货”，自然也失去了特殊的身价。对他们来说，这真真是挖不得的呀！
    被这些先生们视作命根子的这东西，在我们看来只不过是病根子，是他们的病根子，也是整个教育和整个社会的一个病根子。最近不少专家、教授在实际面前大出洋相，咎由何来？远离实际便装腔作势，一站到实际面前来，便露出那副可怜相来，岂非病态？就照这些先生们自己说的“脑袋大、手小”，又有什么可贵之处？至于它的为害社会，造成人同人之间的对立的大病就更不用说了。因此，这病根势在必挖，而党的“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，正是要彻底挖除这病根而植下幸福健康的根子。
    教育与生产劳动相分离的确是一种根子，用新的方针和制度来代替它，的确又是挖根子。问题就在于把它看作是什么根子？而又怎样对待挖根子：是当作命根子而死命抵住不让挖呢？还是当作病根子而欢迎别人来挖，同时自己也积极地挖？这便是立足与不同立场的两种人的分界。
