    The Hungarian musical dances have left a very deep impression on the Chinese people. The melody and simple dance steps of "Bottle Dance" are popular among the masses. The works of Hungarian musicians Liszt and Bartok are very familiar to the Chinese music circle and a wide range of music lovers. Therefore, when the Hungarian Music and Ballet Art Troupe arrived in Beijing, the performance tickets were quickly snatched up.

    They focused on introducing the works of Hungarian national composers Liszt, Bartok, Kodály, Erkel, and Farkas, while also performing famous works by world classical writers.

    Némethy Lili, is a highly artistically accomplished opera soloist. She performed Kodály's "Under Mount Csitár," and sang the aria from Puccini's opera "Madame Butterfly." She demonstrated a particularly deep understanding of Madame Butterfly's role, her situation at the time, and her longing for her lover, as well as the complex changes in her psychology. The timbre of her voice was rich and varied, and she exuded the deepest charm in the soft, tender, and miserable passages.

    Gábor Gabos' piano solo was also a rare program. He was the first prize winner of the Paris International Piano Competition. He played Chopin's "Polonaise in A-flat major," the famous revolutionary dance that expressed the patriotic spirit of the Polish people, which was fully elucidated by the performer. He was passionate, powerful, meticulously analytical, and sharply contrasting, throwing his whole heart and soul into the deepest part of the music. From his performance, people could also feel the strong and ardent characteristics of the Hungarian Liszt piano school.

    Baráth László, a baritone, is a singer with a sonorous, even, and dramatic voice. From his handling of "Toreador Song" from "Carmen" and Erkel's "My Homeland" from "Bánk Bán", the character of his voice is also colorful and distinctive.

    Cellist Dénes Vera is a very experienced performer with high technique. The two young violinists each have their own characteristics. Kovács Dénes is delicate, with a beautiful tone and rich variations, while Szirmay András is fiery and sharply contrasting. Both received enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    Finally, I would also like to say that the performances of the four solo dancers from the Hungarian State Opera House in the art troupe were also warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience. Let me wish the entire art troupe greater success in its performance tour in our country.

    匈牙利艺术家的演出
    李凌
    匈牙利的音乐舞蹈，在我国人民中，有着极深的印象，《瓶舞》的旋律和朴素的舞步，在广大的群众中流行着，匈牙利音乐家李斯特、巴尔托克的作品，对中国音乐界和广泛的音乐爱好者说来，是很熟悉的。因此，当匈牙利音乐芭蕾舞艺术团一到北京，演出的入场券很快就一抢而光了。
    他们着重地介绍了匈牙利民族作曲家李斯特、巴尔托克、科达伊、艾格尔、法卡斯的作品，同时表演了世界古典作家的名作。
    奈梅尼·丽丽，是一位艺术修养极高的歌剧院独唱演员，她表演了科达伊的“奇塔山下”，更唱了普契尼的歌剧《蝴蝶夫人》中的咏叹调。她对蝴蝶夫人这个角色，当时的处境，和蝴蝶夫人对恋人的思念，和心理上的复杂的变化，表现得特别深刻，她的歌声的音色是丰富多样的，在轻声的、柔情的、苦惨的段落中，她体现出至深的魅力。
    高伯什·加伯尔的钢琴独奏，也是一个难得的节目，他是巴黎国际钢琴比赛会第一名获奖者，他弹奏了肖邦的《变A长音阶波罗涅兹舞曲》，这首有名的表现了波兰人民爱国精神的革命舞曲，被演奏者充分地阐扬出来。他热情，有力，分析细致，对比鲜明，全身心倾入到音乐最深中间去了。从他的表演中，人们还可以感到匈牙利李斯特钢琴学派刚劲，炽热的特点。
    男中音保罗兹·拉斯洛，是一位声音雄浑、匀称，而富于剧性的歌唱家，从他对《卡门》中的《斗牛士之歌》和艾格尔的《班克督军》中的《我的祖国》的处理，声音的性格也是多彩而有特色的。
    大提琴家德奈什·维拉是很有经验的表演者，她的技巧是很高的，两位年青的小提琴家各有特点，柯瓦奇·德奈什是细致、音色优美，变化丰富，西莫尔·安德烈什则火热、对比强烈，都受到观众热情的喝彩。
    最后，我还要说一句，艺术团中四位匈牙利国家歌剧院独舞演员的表演，同样受到了北京观众的热烈欢迎。让我预祝艺术团全体在我国的访问演出，将获得更大的成功。
