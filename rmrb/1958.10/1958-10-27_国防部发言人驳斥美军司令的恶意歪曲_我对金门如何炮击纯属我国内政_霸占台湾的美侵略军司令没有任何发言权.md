Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The commander of the US forces invading Taiwan, Vice Admiral Smott, issued a statement on October 26th, falsely accusing our Fujian front troops' bombardment of Jinmen today of violating the order announced by our Minister of National Defense, Peng Dehuai, in the "Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots" on October 25th. In response, the spokesperson of our Ministry of National Defense issued the following statement: Today happens to be an even-numbered date. Our Fujian front troops strictly abided by the order of our Minister of National Defense. When bombarding Jinmen, they did not hit Jinmen's airport, the wharf at Liaoluo Bay, the beaches, or ships. The statement by Vice Admiral Smott, commander of the US forces invading Taiwan, is a deliberate distortion of the order of our Minister of National Defense. Whether our army bombards Jinmen and how it bombards Jinmen is entirely China's internal affair, and no outsider has the right to interfere. The commander of the US aggressor army occupying China's territory of Taiwan has even less right to speak.

    新华社26日讯　侵台美军司令斯摩特海军中将在10月26日发表声明，诬蔑我福建前线部队今日炮击金门是违反了我国防部长彭德怀元帅在10月25日“再告台湾同胞书”中所宣布的命令。为此，我国防部发言人发表谈话如下：今日适逢双日，我福建前线部队严格遵守了我国防部长的命令，在炮击金门时，没有打金门的飞机场、料罗湾的码头、海滩和船只。侵台美军司令斯摩特海军中将的声明是对我国防部长命令的故意歪曲。我军对金门是否炮击和如何炮击，完全是中国的内政，不容外人置喙，霸占着中国领土台湾的美国侵略军司令更没有任何发言权。
