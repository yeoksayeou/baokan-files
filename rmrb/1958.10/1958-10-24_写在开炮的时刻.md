Xiamen Letter

    Writing at the Moment of Bombardment
    Li Li
    At this moment, the Xiamen front is filled with the roar of artillery fire, as our heroic soldiers are treating the Chiang bandit troops to some "snacks."
    Before serving the "snacks," our forward broadcasting station, which is very, very close to Kinmen, repeatedly broadcast the order for our army to resume shelling, the sound waves crossing the uneasy sea surface and reaching Kinmen Island.
    I remember that when our army announced a temporary cessation of shelling more than ten days ago, this broadcasting station, known as the "Voice of Peace," also sent humanitarian gospel to Kinmen Island. In an observation post, I saw those Chiang troops cowering in their bunkers, coming out to sunbathe and swim in the sea during the day; Chiang Kai-shek's warships and planes also came and went, desperately transporting and unloading supplies to Kinmen. At that time, I went to an artillery position, and a soldier told me: These days, we are giving Kinmen a "holiday" to see if Chiang Kai-shek repents. If he doesn't repent, let him transport! No matter how much he transports, it doesn't amount to anything. A few days ago, we only fired a few shells and made the enemy dizzy. Sure enough, those frightened pilots even delivered the canned pork meant for the besieged Kinmen to our position.
    Tonight, as the thunderous artillery fire punishing the Chiang bandit troops echoes from the front again, I am reminded of what this soldier said. Chiang Kai-shek is nothing, and American imperialism is just so-so. Our thousands of soldiers have this kind of heroic spirit.
    The artillery fire interrupted my thoughts, and I went out into the street. I only heard people shouting "Extra! Extra!" The Xiamen Daily extra edition spread the news of the resumption of shelling throughout the island. Like a mobilization order, the people on the front line took action.
    Another night of battle has begun. A blaze of fire reddened the night sky. This city of 200,000 people is fighting for steel again. These days, they have continuously broken through the daily output of 100 tons of steel and are advancing towards the goal of 200 tons per day. Beside thousands of small steel furnaces, people are refining pig iron and scavenged shrapnel into steel. The people of He厝乡, on the front line, made a vow beside the iron smelting furnace to be pioneers in supporting the front and increasing steel production. The "Little Eighth Route Armies" and "Ten Sisters," who made great contributions to supporting the front since August 23rd, have launched support activities again. In the midst of the artillery fire, the children polished the shells until they shone. They also boiled water and sent it to the positions.
    Steel is strength! On this front line, resounding with artillery fire, we have a new understanding of this sentence. (Xiamen, October 20)

    写在开炮的时刻
    黎梨
    此刻，厦门前线炮声隆隆，我们的英勇的战士们正在请蒋贼军吃“点心”了。
    在请吃“点心”之前，我们那个离金门很近很近的前沿对敌广播站，一次又一次地播送我军恢复炮击的命令，声波穿过不平静的海面传到金门岛上。
    我记得，十几天前，我军宣布暂停炮击的时候，这个被称为“和平之音”的广播站，也给金门岛上送去人道主义的福音。我在一个观察所里，看到过那些龟缩在地洞里的蒋军，大白天跑了出来晒太阳，洗海澡；蒋介石的军舰、飞机，也来来往往，拚命往金门运卸物资。那时候，我到过一个炮兵阵地，有个战士曾经告诉我：这几天，我们给金门“放假”，看蒋介石悔悟还是不悔悟。不悔悟，运呀！运再多也算不了什么。前些天，我们不过打了一些炮弹，就把敌人打得昏头昏脑。可不，那些吓坏了胆的飞行员，连把送给围困中的金门的猪肉罐头，也送到我们阵地上来了。
    今夜，前线又传来惩罚蒋贼军的隆隆的炮声时，使我想起了这个战士说的这段话。蒋介石算不了什么，美帝国主义也不过如此。我们的千万战士就是有这种英雄的气概。
    炮声打断了我的思潮，我走上街头。只听见街上吵嚷着“号外……号外”。厦门日报号外把恢复炮击的消息传遍全岛。像一纸动员令，前线人民行动起来了。
    又一个战斗的夜开始了。一片火光，映红了夜空。这个二十万人的城市，又在为钢而战。这些天来他们已经连续突破了日产百吨钢的大关，正在向日产二百吨的目标前进。在千百个小炼钢炉旁，人们把生铁和拣来的炮弹片炼成钢。前沿何厝乡的人民，在炼铁炉旁立下誓言，支前打先锋，炼钢增高产。8月23日以来支前立下大功的“小八路”、“十姐妹”又开展了支前活动。炮声中，孩子们把炮弹擦得亮闪闪。他们也烧了开水送到阵地上。
    钢铁就是力量！在这震响着炮声的前沿，我们对这句话又有了新的体会。　（10月20日厦门）
