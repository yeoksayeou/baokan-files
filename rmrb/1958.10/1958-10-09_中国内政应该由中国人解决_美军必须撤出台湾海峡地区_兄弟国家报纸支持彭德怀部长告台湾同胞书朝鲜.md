Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th: "Democratic Korea" today published a commentary on the message to Taiwan compatriots by Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, saying that there is only one China, and that is the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people will inevitably restore the integrity of their territory. This is an inevitable historical result that no force can stop, and it is also the firm and unwavering will of the Chinese people.

The commentary pointed out that Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the coastal islands are inseparable parts of China's territory. Liberating these islands is entirely China's internal affair and a continuation of the ongoing Chinese revolutionary war. This is a fact that no one can deny today. The commentary pointed out that there are two issues of different natures regarding the Taiwan issue: the issue of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan and other islands, and the issue of eliminating the tension caused by the U.S. occupation of this region. These two different issues must be resolved according to different principles and methods.

The commentary said that the Chinese government's proposal to hold talks with the Taiwan authorities, and its decision to suspend the shelling of Jinmen Island for seven days, once again demonstrated the Chinese people's love and humanity towards their compatriots.

The commentary emphasized that the issue between China and the United States should be treated separately. There is no war between China and the United States at present, so there is no "ceasefire." To solve the issue between China and the United States, the U.S. imperialism must withdraw from the Taiwan Strait region. The commentary said that any shameless sophistry of U.S. imperialism is untenable. The United States must not be allowed to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" newspaper today pointed out in a commentary on Minister Peng Dehuai's message to Taiwan compatriots that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's bombardment of Jinmen and Mazu was a punitive measure against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was constantly harassing and sabotaging the mainland using China's coastal islands. This is entirely the internal affair of the Chinese people. The tension in the Taiwan Strait area is entirely caused by the armed provocations of U.S. imperialism against China.

The commentary warned the U.S. aggressors that it is now very clear that if the U.S. imperialists do not get out of Taiwan, they must bear the serious consequences of their aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 8th: The Hungarian "People's Freedom" pointed out in a commentary on the 8th that the U.S. ruling clique, in order to save face, is trying to treat China's decision to temporarily stop shelling Jinmen as China's acceptance of the U.S. "ceasefire" proposal. But this is not the case at all. There is no war between China and the United States, so there is no so-called "ceasefire."

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. ruling clique is still pursuing a policy of provocation against China, but neither provocation nor threats can intimidate the Chinese people.

The commentary reminded that we must not be paralyzed in the slightest, because the United States is still continuing to transport war materials to the islands off the coast of mainland China, and is transporting new missiles to Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 8th: The Polish "People's Tribune" today published a commentary on the message to Taiwan compatriots by Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai.

The commentary wrote that it is necessary to clearly distinguish between two issues: the first is China's internal issue. This is the indisputable right of the People's Republic of China to liberate its territory. This issue is a continuation of the Chinese civil war after the Chinese People's Liberation Army crushed the forces of Chiang Kai-shek. This issue should be resolved by China itself. The second issue is the presence of U.S. armed forces and U.S. armed escort for Chiang Kai-shek in the Taiwan Strait.

The commentary said that the United States should stop occupying Chinese territory thousands of nautical miles away from the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 8th: The Romanian "Spark" newspaper today published a commentary on the message to Taiwan compatriots issued by our Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, saying that this message can remind the people of Taiwan that the most ferocious enemy of all the Chinese people is U.S. imperialism. The decisions of China mentioned in the message will further isolate those who continue to interfere in China's internal affairs. The people of all countries will further unite their forces and resolutely demand that the United States end its policy of aggression and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

The commentary emphasized that Peng Dehuai's message once again shows that the policy of aggression and interference in China's internal affairs pursued by the United States is absurd, completely unrealistic, and illogical. If the United States continues on the path of war, it will inevitably face the most shameful defeat.

    中国内政应该由中国人解决  美军必须撤出台湾海峡地区
    兄弟国家报纸支持彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书朝鲜
    新华社平壤8日电  “民主朝鲜报”今天就中国国防部部长彭德怀的告台湾同胞书发表评论说，中国只有一个，这就是中华人民共和国。中国人民必将恢复他们的领土的完整，这是任何力量也不能阻挡的历史必然结果，也是中国人民坚定不移的意志。
    评论指出，台湾、澎湖列岛和沿海岛屿是中国不可分割的领土。解放这些岛屿完全是中国的内政问题，也是一直在进行着的中国革命战争的延续，这是今天任何人也不能否认的事实。评论指出，在台湾问题上存在两个性质不同的问题：中国人民解放台湾等岛屿的问题和消除由于美国侵占这个地区而造成的紧张局势问题。对这两个不同的问题，必须根据不同的原则和采取不同的方法加以解决。
    评论说，中国政府建议同台湾当局举行会谈，同时决定停止炮击金门岛七天，再次表现了中国人民对同胞的爱和人道主义。
    评论强调说，但是，中美间的问题应当另作别论。目前中美两国之间没有进行任何战争，谈不到什么“停火”。要解决中美两国之间的问题，只有美帝国主义从台湾海峡地区撤走。评论说，美帝国主义的任何厚颜无耻的诡辩都是站不住脚的。绝对不能容许美国干涉中国的内政。
    保加利亚
    新华社索非亚8日电  保加利亚“工人事业报”今天在一篇评论彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书的文章中指出，中国人民解放军炮轰金门、马祖是对利用中国沿海岛屿不断对大陆进行骚扰和破坏的蒋介石集团的惩罚性的措施，这完全是中国人民的内政。而台湾海峡地区的紧张局势则完全是由美帝国主义对中国的武装挑衅所造成的。
    评论警告美国侵略者说，现在已经非常清楚，如果美帝国主义者不从台湾滚出去，就必须承担他们的侵略行动所引起的严重后果。
    匈牙利
    新华社布达佩斯8日电  匈牙利“人民自由报”8日在一篇评论中指出，美国统治集团为了少丢面子，企图把中国暂时停止炮轰金门的决定当做是中国接受了美国“停火”的建议。但是事实根本不是这样，中美两国之间并没有发生战争，无所谓“停火”。
    评论指出，美国统治集团仍然在执行对中国挑衅的政策，但是无论是挑衅或者是威胁，都不能够吓倒中国人民。
    评论提醒说，现在一点也不允许我们麻痹，因为美国仍然在把战争物资继续运到中国大陆沿海的岛屿，并且把新的导弹运到台湾。
    波兰
    新华社华沙8日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天就中国国防部长彭德怀的告台湾同胞书发表了评论。
    评论写道，必须十分明确地分清两个问题：第一是中国内部的问题。这是中华人民共和国解放领土的无可争辩的权利。这个问题是中国人民解放军粉碎了蒋介石力量以后的中国内战的继续。这个问题应当由中国自己解决。第二个问题是台湾海峡存在着美国武装力量和美国为蒋介石进行武装护航。
    评论说，美国应当停止占领远离美国好几千海里的中国领土的做法。
    罗马尼亚
    新华社布加勒斯特8日电　罗马尼亚“火花报”今天就我国国防部长彭德怀发表的告台湾同胞书发表评论说，这一文告可以使台湾的人们记住，全中国人民最凶恶的敌人是美帝国主义。文告中所谈到的中国的决定将使那些继续干涉中国内政的人们更加孤立。各国人民将更加团结自己的力量，坚决要求美国终止侵略政策、停止干涉中国的内政。
    评论强调指出，彭德怀的文告再一次表明，美国所奉行的侵略和干涉中国内政的政策是荒谬的、完全不现实和不合逻辑的。如果美国继续走战争的道路，那么等待它的必将是最可耻的失败。
