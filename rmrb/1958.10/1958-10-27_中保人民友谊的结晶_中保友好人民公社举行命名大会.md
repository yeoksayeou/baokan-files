Xinhua News Agency, The crystallization of Sino-Bulgarian People's Friendship: Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune Holds Naming Ceremony.

According to Xinhua News Agency, a people's commune in Xishan Township, western suburbs of Beijing, was named the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune today and held a naming ceremony. Participants in the meeting included Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Mr. Panchevski, the Bulgarian agricultural delegation headed by Mr. Buchevalov, Minister of Agriculture of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, and staff members of the Bulgarian Embassy.

Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, Vice Mayor of Beijing Wu Han, and Vice Minister of Agriculture Yang Xiandong also attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Buchevalov, on behalf of the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, presented the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune with nine kinds of gifts, including electric centrifugal water pumps, five-bottom plows, vineyard sprayers, fodder cutters, computers, and broadcasting equipment.

Wu Han said at the meeting that the naming of this commune and the gifts presented by Bulgaria are a great encouragement to us. He encouraged the members of the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune to exert their efforts and make greater achievements in order to respond to the kindness of the Bulgarian people.

Ambassador Panchevski said that the brotherly friendship and all-round cooperation between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples are developing day by day, and this is also reflected in agriculture. Many Bulgarian experts have visited China to learn from China's agricultural experience, and have successfully trial-planted excellent varieties of rice, tomatoes, and sweet potatoes in Bulgaria. Bulgaria has a "Eastern Red" agricultural production cooperative, which, together with the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune, will become a living monument to the eternal brotherly friendship and mutual assistance between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples.

Buchevalov, Yang Xiandong, and Yang Ming, the representative of the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship People's Commune, also spoke.
