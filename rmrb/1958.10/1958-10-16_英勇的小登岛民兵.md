    Heroic Militiamen of Little Deng Island

    Fighting Shoulder to Shoulder with the Artillery
    On August 23rd, when our heroic artillery forces launched a punitive counterattack against the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen, the sixteen militiamen of Little Deng Island, including Hong Machao and Xu Shenzhu, were at the pier, transporting artillery shells to the front lines. When they heard the roar of our artillery, they felt extremely happy and immediately requested to participate in the artillery battle from the leaders of the artillery unit. On the front line, they stripped to the waist and passed shells one by one to the gunners, loaded them into the gun barrels, and fiercely attacked the enemy until the end of the battle.
    Many militiamen lived on the front lines, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the artillerymen. One day, twenty-five militiamen participated in a fierce battle. Although the ears of Qiu Qingzhi, Hong Tian, and others were bleeding from the shock, they were all in high spirits, shouting while fighting, "Good shot, accurate shot, keep it up!" In another artillery battle, the front line urgently needed to replenish ammunition. The militiaman Zhang Yuanshun led eight militiamen, broke through the enemy's artillery blockade, and braved the flying shrapnel to bring a large amount of ammunition. Then, they wiped these shells clean and handed them to the gunners, firing at the enemy's positions. Another day, when Qiu Jinjing was transporting shells with sixteen militiamen, they were suddenly attacked by enemy artillery fire. One militiaman's heel and the top of his foot were burned and bleeding by enemy shrapnel, but he still bravely sent a large number of shells to the front line.
          Practicing Military Skills in Battle
    In August, the weather was hot, and the militiamen took advantage of every spare moment to learn military skills. Many people lay prone on the scorching ground at noon, practicing gun aiming, and some people did not stop even when their knees were scraped. In a very short time, they learned the skills of shooting, marching, and weapon maintenance to kill the enemy. Since the start of the artillery battles, they have been supporting the front, fighting, and practicing military skills at the same time. Hong Machao, Qiu Ruiren, Qiu Qingzhi, and eighteen others actively learned various artillery techniques during rest periods from supporting the front. They have now learned several gunner actions. Some have even become gunners, fighting alongside the artillerymen to strike the enemy. Now they are rushing to master "aiming skills," determined to become "all-around gunners" in the shortest possible time.
    Pointing Out a Way Out for Chiang's Troops
    At dawn on September 15th, more than a dozen tall wooden signs stood on the sea off Kinmen, with the words "Chiang's officers and soldiers, surrender and revolt, you will be rewarded for meritorious service" written on them. Each character was one square zhang in size. This was a propaganda slogan made by this militia team with wooden boards to point out a way out for Chiang's troops. On the night of the 14th, Hong Shunli led sixteen militiamen, bravely sailed a small boat, and used very ingenious methods to erect this propaganda slogan in front of the enemy.
    The militiamen's vigilance, strength, and courage have been loved by the masses and the officers and soldiers of the army. The leaders of the army cherish them as much as their own soldiers. A unit of the People's Liberation Army presented them with a large red flag with the words "Model of Supporting the Front." The township also awarded merits to more than forty militiamen.

    英勇的小登岛民兵
    新华社记者　曾永明
    同炮兵并肩作战
    8月23日，我英勇的炮兵对金门蒋军进行惩罚性反击时，小登岛上的民兵洪马超、许神助等十六人正在码头上，向阵地搬运炮弹。当他们听到我军大炮的怒吼声以后，心里痛快极了，立即向炮兵部队首长要求参加炮战。在阵地上，他们光着膀子，把一发一发炮弹递给炮手，填进炮膛，猛击敌人，一直到战斗结束。
    许多民兵曾住在阵地上，和炮兵们并肩作战。一天，二十五个民兵参加了一次激烈的战斗。丘清志、洪田等耳朵虽然被震得流血，但个个精神抖擞，边打边喊：“打得好，打得准，加油打啊！”在另一次炮战中，阵地上急需补充弹药，民兵张元顺带着八个民兵，冲过敌人炮火封锁地带，冒着横飞的弹片搬来了大批的炮弹，然后把这些炮弹擦得亮光光地递给炮手，射向敌人的阵地。另一天，丘金敬带着十六个民兵在搬运炮弹的时候，突然遭到敌人炮火的袭击。有一个民兵的脚跟、脚面被敌人的弹片烫破流血了，但他仍然勇敢地把大批炮弹送上了阵地。
          战斗中习武
    8月，天气炎热，民兵们利用点滴空隙时间学习军事技术。许多人在烈日当空的中午，伏在炙人肌肤的地上，练习枪法瞄准，有的人膝盖擦破了，还不停止。他们在很短的时间内，学会了枪法、步法、武器保管等杀敌本领。炮战开始以来，他们边支前，边战斗，边习武。洪马超、丘瑞仁、丘清志等十八人在支前休息时间，积极学习打炮的各种技术。现在已学会了几个炮手的动作。有的人还当上了炮手，与炮兵共同打击过敌人。现在他们正在突击“瞄准头”，决心在最短的时间内，成为“全能炮手”。
    给蒋军指明出路
    9月15日黎明，金门的海面上耸立着十多个高大的木牌，上面写着“蒋军官兵，投诚起义，立功受奖”。每个字都有一方丈大。这是这支民兵队为了给蒋军指明出路，用木板做的宣传标语牌。14日晚上，洪顺利带着十六个民兵，勇敢地架着小船，用非常巧妙的方法，把这个宣传标语牌竖在敌人的面前。
    民兵们这种机警、坚强、勇敢的精神，受到广大群众与部队官兵的热爱。部队首长像对自己的战士一样对他们爱护备至。解放军某部赠给他们一面“支前模范”的大红旗。乡里也为四十多个民兵评了功。
