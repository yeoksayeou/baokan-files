Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 29th: Pyongyang newspapers today published editorials warmly supporting the statement issued by the Korean government regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and strongly demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea.

    The "Rodong Sinmun" editorial stated that the Chinese People's Volunteers completed their historically significant withdrawal work on the 26th, opening up a new situation for easing tensions in Korea and promoting a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and making a significant contribution to maintaining peace in Asia. The editorial stated that the Korean government's demand in the statement for the U.S. government to withdraw its troops from South Korea reflects the unanimous desire of all Korean people who yearn for the peaceful reunification of their country, and is also a legitimate demand that conforms to the interests of peace in the Far East and the world.

    The editorial stated that Korea belongs to the Korean people, and the Korean people can solve their own problems themselves, and no external force has the right to interfere. It is unreasonable for the U.S. aggressor troops to invade Korea and forcibly occupy South Korea. Now that five years have passed since the Korean armistice and the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea, the U.S. has no excuse to remain in South Korea.

    The editorial pointed out that the U.S. State Department's statement on the 27th shamelessly used the so-called "United Nations resolution" as an excuse to refuse to withdraw its aggressor troops from South Korea. The editorial stated that the so-called "United Nations resolution" is nothing more than a tool for U.S. imperialism to steal the banner of the United Nations to carry out its war of aggression against Korea, and it can never be used as an excuse to refuse withdrawal. The U.S. State Department's use of this to defend itself only exposes its dead end.

    The editorial stated that the U.S. aggressors are still dreaming of permanently dividing Korea and turning South Korea into its colony and military base. But whether the aggressors want it or not, the day of their withdrawal will inevitably come. After the Chinese People's Volunteers voluntarily and completely withdrew, the voices demanding the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from Korea have become louder and louder throughout the socialist camp and the vast majority of Asian and African countries, and even within Western countries. The time is ripe to end the U.S. aggressor troops' forcible occupation of South Korea, eliminate the root cause of the war threat in Korea, and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Korean people can no longer endure the tragedy of national and territorial division. The U.S. aggressor troops must get out of South Korea without delay.

    The editorial concluded by saying that today, the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue depends on the sincerity of the United States. People all over the world are closely watching what attitude the U.S. aggressors will take.

    The "Democratic Korea" editorial stated that the historically significant action of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea fully complies with the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and will play a huge role in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of tensions in the Far East.

    The editorial also demanded that the U.S. imperialists abandon their stupid policy of aggression and immediately withdraw their aggressor troops from South Korea. The editorial pointed out that this is the only path for the U.S. imperialists.

    平壤各报发表社论指出
    全世界都注视着美国的态度
    新华社平壤29日电　平壤各报今天发表社论，热烈支持朝鲜政府就中国人民志愿军从朝鲜全部撤出一事发表的声明，并且强烈要求美国侵略军从南朝鲜撤走。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说，中国人民志愿军在26日全部完成了有历史意义的撤军工作，为缓和朝鲜紧张局势和促使和平解决朝鲜问题打开了新的局面，并且对于维护亚洲和平作出了重大的贡献。社论说，朝鲜政府在声明中要求美国政府把他的军队从南朝鲜撤出，这反映了渴望和平统一祖国的全朝鲜人民的一致愿望，也是符合远东和世界和平利益的正当要求。
    社论说，朝鲜是属于朝鲜人民的，朝鲜人民自己可以解决自己的问题，任何外力都没有权利干涉。美国侵略军侵略朝鲜、强占南朝鲜是毫无道理的，在朝鲜停战已经过了五年，中国人民志愿军已经全部撤出了朝鲜的今天，美国更没有任何借口赖在南朝鲜不走。
    社论指出，美国国务院27日发表的声明中，厚颜无耻地拿所谓“联合国决议”为借口，拒绝从南朝鲜撤出侵略军。社论说，所谓“联合国决议”只不过是美帝国主义者盗用联合国的旗帜作为进行侵朝战争的工具罢了，绝不能用来作为拒绝撤军的口实，而美国国务院竟以此来进行辩护，只能暴露了它的穷途末技。
    社论说，美国侵略者还在做梦，想永远分裂朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成他的殖民地和军事基地。但是不管侵略者愿不愿意，他们撤走的日子必然要到来，在中国人民志愿军主动地全部撤军以后，整个社会主义阵营各国和绝大多数的亚非国家、甚至在西方国家内，要求美国侵略军撤出朝鲜的声音越来越响亮了；终止美国侵略军强占南朝鲜、肃清朝鲜的战争威胁的根源和实现朝鲜和平统一的时机早已成熟，朝鲜人民再也不能忍受民族和国土分裂的悲剧。美国侵略军必须毫不延迟地从南朝鲜滚出去。
    社论最后说，今天和平解决朝鲜的问题，就要看美国的诚意如何。全世界人民正在密切注视着美国侵略者究竟采取什么态度。
    “民主朝鲜报”的社论说，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜这一富有历史意义的行动，完全符合朝鲜停战协定的规定，同时对于朝鲜问题的和平解决和缓和远东的紧张局势将起巨大的作用。
    社论还要求美帝国主义者抛弃愚蠢的侵略政策，立即从南朝鲜撤退它的侵略军。社论指出，这是美帝国主义者唯一的道路。
