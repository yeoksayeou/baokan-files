    Who Should Be Taught a Lesson?
    Ji Gong
    The old tune of "all other professions are base, only 'theory' is noble" is gradually retreating in this rapidly changing era, in the face of the constantly emerging mythical facts. However, in the depths of some people's hearts, it is not truly and sincerely convinced. If it encounters a suitable climate and soil, it will inevitably ferment and grow again. Therefore, it is also necessary to talk about lessons.
    A story that happened at Tsinghua University was published in the newspaper: When the foundry workshop was manufacturing ductile iron castings for the locomobile boiler, the temperature of the furnace could not rise, and spheroidization was unsuccessful. The workers believed that the opening of the blower should be reduced, but the teachers of the foundry teaching and research group insisted on the so-called "theoretically, the opening should be greater than 25% of the furnace膛," and argued with the workers using foreign books. One worker answered well: "The climate, coke, and furnace bricks here are not foreign. Specific conditions are different, and measures should also be different." The workers reduced the opening for testing, and the temperature immediately rose from 1330 degrees to 1380 degrees, and the ductile iron was successfully manufactured.
    Those professors who usually keep saying: "Theory must be linked to practice!" What "we must humbly learn from the working class"... I am afraid it has long been thrown to the winds. However, the facts are the most eloquent. Those gentlemen who hold theoretical books and shout "theory first" are the ones who should be taught a lesson.
    Is theory necessary? The answer is affirmative. But we will never allow holding "theory" as a capital for being "high above." What we want is a theory that can solve practical production problems and is beneficial to the working people.

    谁应该得到教训？
    继功
    “万般皆下品，唯有‘理论’高”的滥调，在日新月异的年代里、在不断涌现出的神话般的事实面前，已经逐渐在打退堂鼓了。但在某些人的心灵深处，还不是真正心悦诚服的。如果一旦碰到适宜的气候和土壤，它就又会情不自禁地发酵、滋长起来。因此，谈谈教训，也很必要。
    报上登过一件发生在清华大学的故事：铸工车间在制造锅驼机的球墨铸铁铸件时，因为炉子的温度上不去，而球化不成功。工人们认为应当缩小鼓风机的封口，而铸工教研组的教师却坚持所谓“理论上封口应大于炉膛25％”，并且拿着外文书去跟工人争论。一个工人回答得好：“这里的气候、焦炭、炉砖都不是外国的。具体条件不同，措施也应该不同。”工人们缩小封口试验的结果，温度马上从一千三百三十度，提高到一千三百八十度，球墨铸铁就制造成功了。
    那位教授平日挂在嘴边的：什么“理论必须联系实际啊！”什么“一定要向工人阶级虚心学习啊”……怕早已抛到九霄云外去了。然而，事实最雄辩，应该受到教训的，正是那些手捧理论书，口喊“理论至上”的先生们。
    理论要不要？答复是肯定的。但我们决不允许怀抱“理论”作为“高高在上”的资本。我们要的是能够解决生产实际问题的、对劳动人民有益的理论。
