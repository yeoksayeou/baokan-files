Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th. Pyongyang newspapers today devoted a significant portion of their pages to publishing articles and pictures praising the merits of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and published editorials to welcome the return of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to their country.

"Labor News" editorial said that today, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completed the withdrawal of three batches of troops. Korean mothers who lost their sons in the war did not shed tears, but today, when saying goodbye to the Volunteer Army returning home, they are filled with tears, and even the mountains, rivers, plants and trees of Korea cannot help but shake when they hear the whistle of the train carrying the Volunteer Army back home. Every Korean is filled with feelings of reluctance and excitement.

The editorial said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defended the freedom and independence of the Korean people with blood, and safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world. The fact that the people of Korea and China defeated the imperialist aggression forces headed by the United States and achieved victory marks a new era in the history of the Eastern people. This is the death knell for the collapse and disintegration of Western imperialism and colonialism, and a new example of invincible proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that the people of Korea and China love peace, but are by no means afraid of the war threats of imperialist aggressors. Today, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has brilliantly completed its mission and, in accordance with the proactive measures of the governments of Korea and China, has proactively withdrawn from Korea out of a desire for peace. The US aggressor army has no excuse to continue to stay in South Korea. The US aggressors must withdraw from South Korea quickly.

The editorial wished the Chinese People's Volunteer Army a safe journey and great achievements in the great leap forward of socialist construction in their motherland after returning home.

Today's "Democratic Korea" newspaper editorial said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came for justice and peace, and today they leave for peace and justice. Their spirit of faithfully adhering to proletarian internationalism and their sincere desire for the peaceful reunification of Korea not only greatly move the Korean people, but also move peace-loving people all over the world.

The editorial emphasized that the Korean people proudly declare to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: Just like your determination to liberate Taiwan, we are also determined to realize the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

    战友归国去　草木亦动情
    平壤各报发表社论欢送志愿军
    新华社平壤25日电　平壤各报今天以大部分的篇幅发表了赞扬中国人民志愿军的功勋的文章和图片，并发表社论欢送中国人民志愿军总部回国。
    “劳动新闻”的社论说，今天，中国人民志愿军已经结束了先后三批的撤军。朝鲜的母亲在战争中丧失了儿子也没有流泪，但是，今天在送别志愿军回国的时候，却热泪满眶，就连朝鲜山水草木听到志愿军归国列车的汽笛声，也不禁摇动起来。朝鲜人民个个满怀惜别激动之情。
    社论说，中国人民志愿军以鲜血捍卫了朝鲜人民的自由和独立，维护了远东和世界和平。朝中两国人民打退以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力，取得胜利的事实，标志着东方人民的历史进入了新的时代。这是西方帝国主义殖民主义崩溃瓦解的丧钟，是战无不胜的无产阶级国际主义的新榜样。
    社论说，朝中两国人民热爱和平，但是绝不害怕帝国主义侵略者的战争威胁。今天，中国人民志愿军光辉地完成了自己的使命，按照朝中两国政府的主动措施，从为了和平的愿望出发，已经主动从朝鲜撤出。美国侵略军再没有任何借口继续留在南朝鲜了。美国侵略者必须迅速从南朝鲜撤走。
    社论祝中国人民志愿军一路平安，回国后在祖国社会主义建设的大跃进中建立大功。
    “民主朝鲜”报今天的社论说，中国人民志愿军为正义和和平而来，今天又为和平和正义而走。他们这种忠实于无产阶级国际主义的精神和对朝鲜和平统一的真诚愿望，不仅极大地感动着朝鲜人民，而且感动着全世界爱好和平的人民。
    社论强调说，朝鲜人民以骄傲的心情，向中国人民志愿军官兵宣誓：像你们解放台湾的决心一样，我们也决心实现祖国的和平统一。
