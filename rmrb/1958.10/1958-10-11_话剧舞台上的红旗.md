    Red Flag on the Drama Stage
    Feng Zi
    We live in the great Mao Zedong era, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, we are galloping forward to build a socialist society and gradually transition to communism. The Beijing People's Art Theatre recently staged "Blazing Red Heart" and "Red Flag Fluttering," reflecting the face of the great era we live in from different aspects and to different degrees: writing about people with a communist style; writing about how we started from scratch, built our home from nothing, and how we are changing our poor and blank state; writing about how, in the unprecedented furnace of this era, bourgeois intellectuals are transforming themselves under the leadership of the Party; and even more, writing about the leadership thinking and leadership art of Party organizations and Party committee secretaries at all levels, embodying the Party's leadership intentions.
    The deeds of steelworker Qiu Cai Kang and demobilized soldiers like Xu Guoqing are themselves very moving and educational. After reading the story in the newspaper about rescuing Qiu Cai Kang's life, some people were so moved that they shed tears. Qiu Cai Kang's high communist qualities are our best living teaching materials. However, this does not mean that simply moving real people and real events onto the stage constitutes a play. A play requires artistic generalization and processing. At the same time, even if it is a real person and a real event, it depends on the magnitude of the contradictions and conflicts. What to write? How to write? This is the writer's creative yardstick, and it is also the yardstick for readers and audiences to measure the ideological content of a work.
    The authors of "Blazing Red Heart" and "Red Flag Fluttering" accepted such a glorious task and also completed this task well and relatively well. To write about themes that reflect the political outlook of our great era, writers must have the political enthusiasm that is commensurate with our era; otherwise, it will be impossible to complete the task well.
    These two plays, with different themes and different subjects, both profoundly reflect a common and major problem in our society today, which is the contradictory opposition between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. This contradiction is reflected in "Red Flag Fluttering" in the proletarian master's thought of the Party Committee Secretary Lin, who is headed by "doing everything possible to save the steel worker Kang Yongguang," and the ideological struggle between the young doctor's bold initiative to skin grafting and the bourgeois experts such as Director Fang who are superstitious about foreign countries and foreign literature. Under the inspiration and guidance of Secretary Lin, and also infected and educated by the noble proletarian qualities of people like Kang Yongguang, who disregard personal pain, even life, for the sake of the Party's cause and steelmaking, it shows that bourgeois intellectuals like Director Fang can be transformed under the leadership of the Party. This play also shows that capitalist countries cannot create new medical achievements and new medical literature records for a scalded worker; only countries where the proletariat has seized power can create them.
    This contradiction is reflected in "Blazing Red Heart" in the question of how to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction. Bourgeois experts, for the industrial equipment urgently needed by the country, do not consider how to set up factories for manufacturing in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Their minds are filled with the literature and data of capitalist countries; their eyes are on the United States, Britain, and Japan; their minds are considering funds, technology, and equipment; therefore, they speak of ten years at the outset, and the fastest is ten months! However, the demobilized soldier Xu Guoqing, with a tenacious spirit and fighting will, overcame unexpected difficulties and completed the task urgently needed by the Party and the people in just three months. What an amazing miracle! Such a miracle is precisely the reality we live in today! It is precisely such miracles that are changing our country's poor and blank state!
    From the perspective of the thematic political significance and the performance effect of these two plays, they can be said to be new red flags on the drama stage!
    Speaking of the plays themselves, I would like to talk more about
  "Blazing Red Heart." In the shaping of typical characters, "Blazing Red Heart" not only wrote about the fierce tiger company commander Xu Guoqing and other characters such as the demobilized soldier Zhang Fushan, but also wrote about the bourgeois ideological expert Qian Xingmei. Especially Xu Guoqing, the author successfully created this brilliant image with communist ideology and style, which is a creation and example on the drama stage.
    Xu Guoqing is a good son of the Party who has been tempered by revolution. He has experienced the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. His thoughts and feelings are simple but strong, everything is for the revolution, and there are no personal plans. He has never seen or heard of what an electronic tube is. The country needs it, and bourgeois experts have no way to do it. For the sake of the revolution, he asked to undertake this task. Of course, there are many difficulties placed in front of Xu Guoqing. The author did not avoid difficulties and conflicts. On the contrary, through a chain of problems, the conflicts were pushed to a climax. We can see how Xu Guoqing, under the leadership of the Party, overcame the difficulties with revolutionary vigor and unparalleled perseverance. The reason why the character of Xu Guoqing is so prominent is not only because the script writes about how he faced difficulties and how he overcame them, but also because the character of Xu Guoqing is not isolated. There is the Party above, and the masses below. Xu Guoqing is just one of the large collective, and the mental outlook of the characters is also enriched through the relationship between people and the relationship between individuals and the collective. Through Xu Guoqing, we breathe the atmosphere of the era in which we live, because Xu Guoqing is one of the thousands of communist-style builders in our era. Seeing Xu Guoqing will naturally increase confidence a hundredfold. In front of Xu Guoqing, bourgeois ideology and individualists have no place to stand.
      "Blazing Red Heart" also wrote about the leadership of the Party. Writing about the Party's leadership thinking and leadership art is a political task of literary works, but before this, at least in theatrical creation, this task has not been completed very well. From
  the county Party Secretary Han and Zhang Fushan of the Rongjun Refractory Plant in "Blazing Red Heart," as well as the branch led by Xu Guoqing and Zhang Fushan, the leadership role of the Party can be seen very clearly. Secretary Han does not appear many times, but his appearance not only solves the problem, but also pushes the conflict to a higher climax. It is also in these places that the Party's leadership art is written very vividly and figuratively with not much ink, and the Party's ideological leadership is well reflected.
    "Red Flag Fluttering" itself is an educational subject, and it also reflects the new face of communist cooperation in today's society, but in the characterization of the characters and the writing of the Party's leadership, it feels insufficient. "Red Flag Fluttering" seems not bold enough in the excavation of the characters' thoughts. For example, Director Fang, this so-called senior intellectual, should be familiar to the authors, why is such a main character that appears in the script so simple and so gray? Gray is the thought of the type of character Director Fang, but the ideological activities of characters with gray thoughts are very complicated, and they are not completely gray. This kind of person cannot actively come out to bask in the sun, but we want to pull him out to bask in the sun. Director Fang is not stubborn, how does he protect himself, and how does he accept transformation? If we can deeply dig into the soul of this kind of person, then the educational effect on bourgeois intellectuals will be greater.
    The fact that Director Fang is not written enough and the character of Secretary Lin is written simply are related to each other. However, this shortcoming has been compensated for in the performance. Here, the achievements of Yu Shizhi's portrayal of Secretary Lin should be mentioned. Yu Shizhi created a simple and amiable image of a leading cadre, and he was quite decisive in dealing with problems. In the face of complex ideological struggles, the leader needs to make decisive decisions, and Yu Shizhi's performance is very calm and natural on several key issues. Yu Shizhi is an actor familiar to the audience, and the image of Party Committee Secretary Lin he created is a new gain worthy of attention. Good actors should create characters with different personalities, but they should first create characters that mark our era well. We require writers and also require actors to pay attention to absorbing more nourishment in life, and our stage will inevitably have more communist party members, Party leaders, and heroic and exemplary figures who have emerged from the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    The performance of "Blazing Red Heart" is quite exciting. However, the passion of some actors is not full enough. Although they raised their voices in some places, they made people feel that their hearts were not very real. Is there a problem of understanding the ideological feelings of revolutionary soldiers here? In addition, the handling of the local expert Shao Dezhi is also not appropriate. This character is not well written in the script, and it is even more inappropriate for the actor to excessively exaggerate the incompetence and inferiority of the local expert in the image.
    Of course, the script also has some shortcomings in the description of minor characters, such as the love relationship, which makes people feel fake. This is ultimately a secondary issue. It is hoped that Comrade Tong Chao, who has basically grasped the character image of Xu Guoqing, will add more processing to this character and more touch on the character's ideological feelings. Xu Guoqing is a revolutionary soldier, but do not make the revolutionary soldier superficial.
    Liu Chuan, the author of "Blazing Red Heart," accepted this writing task under the guidance of Zhou Huan, the political commissar of the troops stationed in Shenyang. "Red Flag Fluttering" was originally the creation of doctors from Guangci Hospital in Shanghai, and teachers from the Shanghai Theater Academy participated in the writing. These two different collective creations are worth introducing and promoting. Because the effect of this kind of cooperation shows that the Party's general line of more, faster, better, and more economical can insert red flags and release satellites in theatrical creation.

    话剧舞台上的红旗
    凤子
    我们生活在伟大的毛泽东时代，在共产党领导下，正万马奔腾地建设着社会主义社会，并且逐步过渡到共产主义。北京人民艺术剧院最近先后演出的“烈火红心”和“红旗飘飘”，从不同方面、不同程度地反映了我们所生活的这个伟大时代的面貌：写出了具有共产主义风格的人；写出了我们怎样从无到有、白手兴家，怎样在改变着一穷二白的面貌；写出了在这样史无前例的时代的洪炉中，资产阶级知识分子在党领导下怎样在改造着自己；更写出了体现党的领导意图的各级党的组织和党委书记们的领导思想和领导艺术。
    炼钢工人丘财康和像许国清这样的复员军人的事迹本身就十分感动人，富有教育意义。读了报上刊载的关于抢救丘财康生命的故事，有人感动得流下泪来，丘财康的高度的共产主义品质是我们最好不过的活教材。尽管如此，不等于把真人真事搬上舞台就是戏，戏需要艺术的概括和加工，同时，就是真人真事，也要看矛盾冲突性质的大小。写什么？如何写？是作家创作的标尺，也是读者、观众衡量一个作品思想内容的标尺。
    “烈火红心”和“红旗飘飘”的作者们，接受了这样一个光荣任务，而且也很好地和较好地完成了这个任务。要写反映我们伟大时代的政治面貌的题材，作家必须具有和我们这个时代相适应的政治热情，否则就不可能很好地完成任务。
    这两个戏，题材不同，主题不同，但都深刻地反映了我们今天社会上一个共同的、主要的问题，就是无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想对立的矛盾。这个矛盾，反映在“红旗飘飘”里是以党委林书记为首的“用千方百计一定要救活钢铁工人康永光”这种无产阶级主人翁的思想，和青年大夫植皮的大胆创议，同迷信外国、迷信外国文献的方主任等资产阶级专家们之间的思想斗争。在林书记的启发诱导下，又受到像康永光这样为了党的事业、为了炼钢，个人病痛，甚至生命也置之度外的无产阶级高贵品质的感染和教育，说明像方主任这样资产阶级知识分子在党的领导下，是可以得到改造的。这个戏，还说明了资本主义国家不可能为一个烫伤的工人创造新的医学成绩，新的医学文献记录；只有无产阶级掌握了政权的国家才能创造出来。
    这个矛盾反映在“烈火红心”里，是如何贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线问题。资产阶级专家，对于国家急需的工业器材，根本不考虑如何多快好省地设厂制造，他们脑子里塞满了资本主义国家的文献资料；眼睛看着的是美国、英国、日本；心里考虑的是资金、技术、设备；因此一开口就是十年，最快最快也得十个月！可是复员军人许国清以顽强的精神、战斗的意志，克服了意想不到的困难，仅仅三个月时间就完成了党和人民迫切需要的任务。这是多么惊人的奇迹！这样的奇迹正是我们今天所生活的现实！正是这样的奇迹在改变着我国一穷二白的面貌！
    从这两个戏的主题政治意义和演出的效果来看，可以说是话剧舞台上的新的红旗！
    就戏论戏，我想更多地谈一谈
  “烈火红心”。在典型人物的塑造上，“烈火红心”不止是写出了猛虎连长许国清，写出了其他复员军人张福山等人物形象，也写出了资产阶级思想专家钱行美。特别是许国清，作者成功地创造了这个具有共产主义思想和风格的光辉形象，这是话剧舞台上的一个创举和范例。
    许国清是经过革命锻炼的党的好儿子，他经历过抗美援朝战争。他的思想感情单纯而又坚强，一切为了革命，没有任何个人打算。什么叫电偶管，他没见过也没听说过。国家需要，资产阶级专家没有办法，为了革命，他便要求担负起这个任务。当然摆在许国清面前的困难是不少的，作者没有逃避困难和冲突，相反的通过一环扣一环的问题，把冲突推向高潮。我们可以看到许国清在党的领导下，以革命的干劲，无比的毅力如何地克服了困难。许国清这个人物形象所以如此突出，不仅仅因为剧本写出了他如何面对困难和如何克服了困难，同时许国清这个人物也不是孤立的。上面有党，下面有群众。许国清只是大的集体中的一个，通过人和人的关系，个人和集体的关系，也从而丰富了人物的精神面貌。通过许国清，我们呼吸到我们所生活的时代的气息，因为许国清就是我们这个时代里万万千千个共产主义风格的建设者之一。看到许国清，自然地会增长百倍的信心。在许国清面前资产阶级思想和个人主义分子是没有立足之地的。
      “烈火红心”还写出了党的领导。写党的领导思想和领导艺术，是文学作品的一个政治性的任务，可是在这之前，至少，在戏剧创作中还没有很好地完成这个任务。从
  “烈火红心”中的县委韩书记和荣军耐火厂的张福山，以及许国清、张福山所领导的支部，非常鲜明地看出党的领导作用。韩书记出场不多，可是他的出场既解决了问题，又把矛盾推向更高的高潮。也正在这些地方，着墨并不多，却很生动、形象地写出了党的领导艺术，很好地体现了党的思想领导。
    “红旗飘飘”题材本身是具有教育意义的，也反映出了今天社会共产主义大协作的新面貌，可是在人物的刻划和写党的领导上，就感到不足了。“红旗飘飘”在人物思想的挖掘上似乎还不够大胆，像方主任这个所谓高级知识分子吧，应该是作者们所熟悉的，为什么出现在剧本中的这样一个主要人物是那样简单，那样灰色呢？灰色是方主任这一类型人物的思想，可是具有灰色思想的人物，他的思想活动却是很复杂的，也不完全是灰色的。这种人不可能主动地出来晒晒太阳，但我们要拉他出来晒晒太阳。方主任并不是顽固不化的，他是怎样地在防护着自己，又怎样地接受了改造的？如果能深刻地挖一下这种人的灵魂，那么对资产阶级知识分子们的教育作用就更大些。
    方主任写得不够和林书记这个人物写得简单是有相互的关系的。不过，这个缺点在演出时有所弥补。这里应该提到于是之饰演林书记的成绩。于是之创造了一个朴素可亲的领导干部形象，他处理问题时是相当有魄力的。在复杂的思想斗争面前，需要领导者当机立断，在几个关键性问题上，于是之演来是非常从容自然。于是之是观众们熟悉的演员，他创造的党委林书记的形象，是个值得重视的新的收获。好的演员应该创造出各种性格不同的人物，但首先应该创造好标志着我们这个时代的人物来。我们要求作家同时也要求演员注意在生活中多吸收这方面的养料，我们的舞台必然将更多地出现共产党员、党的领导人和工农群众中涌现的英雄、模范的人物形象。
    “烈火红心”的演出相当激动人心。但是，有些演员的激情还不够饱满，尽管在某些地方提高了声音，却使人感到内心不太实在。这里是否存在对革命军人的思想感情的体会的问题？此外，对土专家邵德志的处理也是不够合适的，剧本中这个人物写得不够，演员过多地在形象上渲染土专家的无能和自卑更是不妥的。
    当然剧本对次要人物的描写，也有不够的地方，如爱情关系，就使人感到虚假。这到底是次要的问题。希望基本上把握了许国清这个人物形象的童超同志，对这个人物再加加工，更多地捉摸一下这个人物的思想感情。许国清是革命军人，但不要把革命军人表面化。
    “烈火红心”的作者刘川，在驻沈阳部队周桓政委指导下接受了这个写作任务。“红旗飘飘”原是上海广慈医院医生的创作，上海戏剧学院教员参加了写作的。这两种不同的集体创作，都是值得介绍和提倡的。因为这种合作的效果，说明了党的多快好省的总路线在戏剧创作上是可以插红旗，放出卫星来的。
