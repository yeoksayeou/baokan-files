Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 9th: Anhui Province, implementing the policy of "large-scale purchase, large-scale collection," exceeded this year's national hog and egg procurement plan by 37% in early September. It has become a red banner in the nation's hog and egg procurement work.

    The responsible person of the Finance and Trade Department of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee believes that the early completion of the hog and egg procurement plan is attributed to the following reasons, in addition to this year's production development:

    First, Party committees at all levels highly emphasized the significant meaning of large-scale hog and egg procurement in supporting national construction. Party committees in various regions included procurement work in their work agenda and closely integrated it with the central tasks of each period. For example, during the tense period of fighting drought and protecting seedlings, the Party committee not only organized commercial department cadres to serve this central task but also required them to establish close contact with agricultural cooperatives, pre-ordering purchases from farmers at the drought relief construction sites. As a result, even when the task of fighting drought and protecting seedlings was paramount, procurement work was still completed very well. Party committees at all levels also organized relevant departments to educate farmers in conjunction with the General Line propaganda, so that people of all ages in rural areas enthusiastically sold hogs and eggs to the state. The provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees all established agricultural and sideline product procurement offices to grasp policy ideology, procurement measures, procurement progress, advanced experience, and existing problems, and to powerfully guide procurement work.

    Second, through brainstorming, commercial leading organs enabled employees in various regions to recognize the new situation in rural areas and adopt procurement methods that adapted to this situation. The measures taken by the commercial departments were to increase procurement points and strengthen procurement forces to deepen procurement work in rural areas. In addition to increasing their own procurement personnel and setting up procurement points, the commercial departments also entrusted cooperative stores, People's Banks, grain and oil stations, and supply and marketing departments of agricultural cooperatives to set up purchasing points, and organized hundreds of thousands of rural "five-guarantee" households, rural propagandists, government cadres, teachers, students, and others to assist in procurement. In this way, a vast network of hog and egg procurement was formed in rural areas.

    政治工作深透　办法切合实际
    安徽完成全年生猪鸡蛋收购计划
    据新华社合肥9日电　安徽省贯彻大购大收方针，提前在9月上旬超额37％完成了今年国家的生猪、鸡蛋收购计划。成为全国生猪、鸡蛋收购工作的一面红旗。
    中共安徽省委财贸部负责人认为，生猪、鸡蛋收购计划能够提前完成，除了今年生产有了发展以外，主要有下面几个原因：
    第一，各级党委非常强调大量收购生猪、鸡蛋，对支援国家建设的重要意义。各地党委都把收购工作列入工作日程，同各个时期的中心工作紧密结合起来。例如在抗旱保苗紧张时期，党委一面组织商业部门干部为这一中心任务服务，一面要他们与农业社取得密切联系，在抗旱工地向农民预约收购，结果在抗旱保苗任务压倒一切的时候，收购工作仍旧完成得很好。各级党委还组织有关部门，结合总路线宣传，对农民进行教育，使农村老老少少踊跃地把生猪、鸡蛋卖给国家。省委、地委、县委都设立了农副产品采购办公室，抓政策思想，抓收购措施，抓收购进度，抓先进经验，抓存在的问题，强有力地指导了收购工作。
    第二，商业领导机关通过务虚，使各地职工认清农村中的新形势，采取了适应这个形势的采购方法。商业部门采取的措施是增加收购点，壮大收购力量，使收购工作深入农村。商业部门除了自己增加收购人员、增设收购点以外，还委托合作商店、人民银行、粮油站、农业社供销部设立代购点，并且组织数以十万计的农村五保户、农村宣传员、机关干部、教师、学生等协助收购。这样，在农村中形成了一个庞大的生猪、鸡蛋收购网。
