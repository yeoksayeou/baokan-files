(Reported by our newspaper) The Yunnan Provincial Party Congress Precisely Analyzes the Leaping Forward Situation of the Past Year.
Tension Makes People Progress; Tension Makes Work Progress.
Next Year, We Will Refine Over One Million Tons of Steel and Obtain Three Hundred Billion Jin of Grain.

(Our Newspaper) The Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province concluded on September 30th. This meeting seriously summarized the work of this year. In 1958, Yunnan Province achieved unprecedentedly great achievements on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts. In agriculture, since last winter and this spring, 15 million mu of water conservancy projects have been constructed, exceeding two and a half times the total area built before liberation. Although this year suffered a severe drought unseen in decades, thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the people of Yunnan under the leadership of the Party, the total grain output reached more than 20 billion jin, achieving an average of 1,000 jin of grain per person in the province. The production of cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, sugarcane, and rapeseed will also increase by one to three times compared to last year. The total industrial output value of the province (excluding industrial enterprises run by agricultural cooperatives) has reached more than 1.86 billion yuan, more than doubling last year's industrial output value. The annual output value will increase two to three times, catching up with or exceeding the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries. On the cultural and educational front, 79 counties have basically eliminated illiteracy, and agricultural middle schools have been established in more than 100 counties and cities.

The party representatives attending the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to strive for even greater victories on the existing foundation. In 1959, the total grain output will reach 30 billion jin, 1,500 jin of grain per person, 30 jin of meat, 30 jin of sugar, 10 jin of oil, and 5 jin of cotton. In steel production, every effort will be made to complete the targets of 750,000 tons of pig iron, 500,000 tons of steel, and 80,000 tons of copper.

During the meeting, half of the time was spent on extensive airing of views, full blooming of ideas, and great debates. In the airing of views and debates, the representatives wrote nearly 2,000 big-character posters. Some of these big-character posters used poetry to express their enthusiasm for fighting, and some used paintings to depict a beautiful future, truly a scene of "aspiring to compete with the heavens." A few comrades expressed that "this year is tense, and next year will be even more tense," fearing tension, which is actually a manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking. The Provincial Party Committee made a precise analysis of this thinking. The great achievements of 1958 are the result of the tension of our Yunnan people. The Provincial Party Committee believes that tension will make people progress and tension will make work progress. Our revolutionary practice has proven this simple and plain truth. The Ten-Year Civil War, the 25,000-Li Long March, the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Three-Year War of Liberation were always very tense. Without tension, there would be no revolutionary victory.

At the Party Congress, in order to ensure the overall leap forward of national plans and local industries in future industrial construction, copper will be given a more important position than steel, while completing steel production, to ensure the completion of national tasks. Rapidly improving the transportation conditions inside and outside the province has, to a certain extent, become an important key to the industrial and agricultural construction and the entire economic development of Yunnan. It is necessary to ensure that the Neikun Railway and other lines are opened to traffic in 1960.

In agriculture, on the premise of fully meeting the need for grain, grain and cash crops should advance side by side; unit area yield and planting area must be considered uniformly. With the focus on increasing the average yield of large areas, winter grain crops and cash crops must be developed at a revolutionary speed.

This meeting held enthusiastic discussions on actively leading the establishment of the people's commune movement. The establishment of people's communes will be completed throughout the province by the end of October. However, in establishing communes, the entire process of the movement must be closely integrated with production, and the mass line method of running communes stipulated by the central government must be adhered to.

    云南党代会精辟分析一年来的跃进形势
    紧张使人进步　紧张使工作进步
    明年要炼出上百万吨钢铁拿到三百亿斤粮食
    本报讯　中共云南省第三次党代表大会于9月30日闭幕。这次会议认真总结了今年来的工作。1958年云南省在工农业和其他的战线上，取得空前伟大的成绩。农业方面，去冬今春以来，进行了一千五百万亩的水利建设，超过了解放以前全部兴修面积的两倍半。虽然今年遭到几十年未有的大旱，由于云南人民在党领导下的冲天干劲，使粮食的总产量达到二百多亿斤，做到全省平均每人千斤粮食。棉花、烤烟、甘蔗、油菜经济作物，也将比去年增产一至三倍。全省工业总产值（不包括农业社办的工业）已达到十八亿六千多万元，超过去年工业产值的一倍以上。全年的产值将增长两倍到三倍，赶上或超过农副业的总产值。在文教战线上，有七十九个县已基本上扫除了文盲，一百多个县市普遍办起了农业中学。
    与会的党代表一致表示要在现有的基础上，争取更大的胜利。在1959年，使粮食总产量达到三百亿斤，每人一千五百斤粮食，三十斤肉，三十斤糖，十斤油，五斤棉花。在钢铁生产上，千方百计的完成生铁七十五万吨，钢五十万吨，铜八万吨的指标。
    会议期间，用了一半的时间大鸣、大放、大争。在鸣放辩论中，代表们写了近两千张大字报。这些大字报里有的用诗来表达自己奋战的热情，有的用画来描绘美好的未来，真是一派“欲与天公试比高”的前进气概。有少数同志表示“今年紧张，明年会更紧张”，怕紧张，实际上是一种右倾保守思想的表现。省委对这种思想作了精辟的分析。1958年的伟大成就，就是我们云南人民紧张的结果。省委会认为紧张会使人进步，紧张会使工作进步。我们革命的实践证明了这条简单朴素的真理。十年内战、两万五千里长征、八年抗战、三年解放战争，总是很紧张的，没有紧张便没有革命的胜利。
    党代会上，对今后工业建设上为保证国家计划和地方工业的全面跃进，在一面完成钢铁生产的情况下，将把铜摆在比钢铁还重要的位置上来，来保证国家任务的完成。迅速改善省内外的交通状况，在一定程度上已成为云南工农业建设和整个经济发展的重要关键，必须保证内昆等路在1960年通车。
    农业方面，在充分满足需要粮食的前提下，粮食和经济作物齐头并进；单位面积产量和播种面积必须统一考虑。以全力提高大面积的平均产量为中心，对小春粮食作物和经济作物必须以革命的速度加以发展。
    这次会议对积极领导建立人民公社运动做了热烈的讨论。10月底将在全省范围内完成人民公社的建立。但在建立公社时，必须使整个运动的过程密切结合生产，并坚持中央规定的群众路线的办社方法。
