Xinhua News Agency, October 5th dispatch from New York, October 4th (TASS): Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, and current White House advisor on overseas bases, Hoopes, published an article entitled "The Significance of Overseas Bases for American Strategy" in the October issue of "Foreign Affairs Quarterly."

Hoopes said that the U.S. armed forces are distributed on the territories of approximately thirty-five countries, not even including the regions to which the U.S. later successively dispatched training corps and "advisory groups." If military and administrative personnel are included, a total of more than one million Americans are "engaged in military activities abroad," and the cost of maintaining these armed forces is more than two billion U.S. dollars per year.

Hoopes admitted that the establishment of military bases by the United States on foreign territories "has caused friction and has made relations between the United States and the countries where these bases are located very tense." The author said that in countries where there are U.S. military bases, people are increasingly worried that these bases will become targets of attack and destruction in the event of war.

Hoopes confirmed that the Far East, Africa, and the Middle East are spontaneously resisting atomic weapons. He complained that the United States' European partners in the North Atlantic Group remain as cold as ever to the proposal to provide intermediate-range missiles.

He also said that the weaknesses of overseas bases have been exposed so seriously that it is highly doubtful whether these bases can be used for a long time. However, he insisted that the U.S. overseas base system remains, as in the past, a "major factor in U.S. foreign policy."

    美前国防部副部长承认
    美国到处设立基地犯众怒
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：美国前国防部副部长、现任白宫海外基地问题顾问胡普斯在10月份出版的“外交季刊”上发表了题为“海外基地对美国战略的意义”的文章。
    胡普斯说，美国武装部队分布在大约三十五个国家的领土上，还没有把美国以后陆续派有训练团和“顾问团”的地区计算在内。如果加上军政人员，共有一百多万美国人“在国外进行军事活动”，每年维持这批武装力量的费用在二十亿美元以上。
    胡普斯承认，美国在外国领土上建立军事基地“引起了摩擦，并使美国和设有这些基地的国家之间的关系搞得非常紧张”。作者说，在设有美国军事基地的国家，人们越来越担心，一旦发生战争，这些基地就将成为进攻和破坏的目标。
    胡普斯证实，远东、非洲和中东都自发地抗拒原子武器。他满腹牢骚地指出，美国在北大西洋集团中的欧洲伙伴像过去一样对提供中程导弹的建议仍然非常冷淡。
    他还说，海外基地的弱点已经暴露得十分严重，现在能否长期使用这些基地非常值得怀疑。但是，他坚持说，美国海外基地体系仍然同过去一样，还是“美国对外政策的主要因素”。
