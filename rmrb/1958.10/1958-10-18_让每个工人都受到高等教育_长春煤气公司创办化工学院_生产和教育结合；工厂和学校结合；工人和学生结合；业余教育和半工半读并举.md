    Let Every Worker Receive Higher Education
    Changchun Gas Company Establishes Chemical Engineering Institute
    Combining Production and Education; Combining Factory and School; Combining Workers and Students; Simultaneously Promoting Spare-Time Education and Part-Work, Part-Study
    (Our Dispatch) The Changchun City Gas Company, on the basis of long-term adherence to workers' spare-time education, has established a Chemical Engineering Institute to realize the principle of prioritizing production, closely combining production and education, factory and school, workers and students; and simultaneously promoting spare-time learning and part-work, part-study, gradually moving towards complete unity of factory and school.
    The Gas Company's Chemical Engineering Institute was established in August. It consists of a complete educational system comprising research, advanced, intermediate, higher primary, and technical worker divisions. The Institute has organized all employees into the various divisions, according to the company's production needs, for tiered, department-specific, and major-specific study. The Research Division is composed of veteran workers with more than fifteen years of service in the company, leading cadres, and lecturers from the Chemistry Department of Jilin Normal University. They combine the experience of veteran workers with critical production problems to conduct specialized research, summarize them into theories, guide production, enrich the teaching of various divisions, and write books and establish theories. The Advanced and Intermediate Divisions, which set up various majors according to production needs, absorb employees with considerable skill levels to train them as professional engineers and professional technicians. Workers who have just become literate study in the Higher Primary Division; the Technical Worker Division recruits graduates from higher primary schools in society to train them as technical workers for the factory.
    The president and vice-presidents of this Chemical Engineering Institute are the Party Secretary and Manager of the Gas Company and the principals of the cooperating schools. The faculty members are composed of leading cadres, full-time cultural teachers, technicians, experienced veteran workers from the factory, and some teachers from cooperating schools. Each of them participates in the study of a certain grade level and also serves as a teacher in a certain major. In teaching, they compile teaching materials for each major based on production characteristics, production realities, and personal learning and research insights. Among the more than thirty classes in the Chemical Engineering Institute, many teachers are veteran workers with rich production experience. For example, veteran worker Bian Yuzhong, who once created the national record for charcoal black production using the channel iron method, participates in advanced division studies in his spare time and also teaches charcoal black in the intermediate division. Bian Yuzhong, based on his learning and production experience, prepares his own lesson plans and handouts. In class, he talks about matters related to production in the carbon black workshop. Back in the workshop, they conduct practical operations together. The worker-students in the carbon black workshop quickly understand and accept what he teaches.
    One class in the Intermediate Division of the Chemical Engineering Institute is already implementing part-work, part-study. All newly recruited students in the Technical Worker Division are implementing part-work, part-study. The Advanced Division will also gradually implement part-work, part-study. They organize their studies according to the method of "unifying political study, specializing in technology, and catching up with culture," and put forward the slogan: "Politics is the soul, technology is the center, culture follows, and veteran workers write books and establish theories." They also determine the purpose of study as: "Universally improve, comprehensively develop, be both red and expert, and promote production." In order to help schools outside the factory carry out work-study programs, cultivate more talents for society, and also solve the difficulties of insufficient labor, teachers, and textbooks encountered by some classes in the Chemical Engineering Institute implementing part-work, part-study, they have also fully cooperated with the nearby Tenth Middle School. The Gas Company has helped the Tenth Middle School establish two chemical factories as "satellite" factories of the company and practice factories of the school, and has sent people to provide technical guidance and assist in solving supply, production, and sales problems. The Tenth Middle School helps the company run the Technical Worker Division and organizes part-work, part-study students to participate in labor in the company.
    The Chemical Engineering Institute closely revolves around production and key technical issues to carry out scientific research and teaching, and pays attention to combining basic courses with professional courses. The Advanced and Intermediate Divisions of the Institute determine basic courses based on professional courses. Courses that are not closely related to the major are treated as general studies. In order to complete the major task assigned by the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China of producing 40,000 tons of metallurgical coke by the end of the year, the Research Division has determined two research topics: "How to refine metallurgical coke using horizontal furnaces" and "How to solve coke refining in earth kilns and recover by-products." After two discussions, they solved a series of problems such as how to use the original horizontal furnaces and the newly built fifty earth kilns to manufacture machinery, use substitutes, fully recover by-products, and crush, screen, wash coal, and dry distillation in the absence of raw materials, ensuring the completion of the 40,000-ton metallurgical coke task. A large batch of metallurgical coke has now begun to be refined, and a considerable amount of by-products such as gas, tar, and carbon black will be recovered successively.
    Of the fifty-seven workers studying in the pipeline class of the Intermediate Division, only seven people could understand drawings when installing gas pipelines in the past, but now they can all install according to the drawings. After the workers in the carbon black workshop participated in the study, the output has jumped from 400 kilograms per shift in the past to 1,600 kilograms, and they are now striving to reach 1,800 kilograms or more.
    Changchun City Gas Company is an old enterprise with a history of more than thirty years. There are many veteran workers in this factory, but the workers' cultural level is very low. In 1952, only three workers in the entire factory had junior high school education, and illiteracy accounted for 76% of the total number of employees. The technology in the factory is very complex, and more than 85% of the entire production process belongs to technical operation, while there are very few technicians in the factory. The technical guidance of the entire production almost entirely relies on the practical experience of veteran workers. The veteran workers feel very distressed about their lack of education. In order to enable veteran workers to improve their culture, reform technology, and improve productivity as soon as possible, this factory started running workers' spare-time schools in 1952. Now, all workers in the factory have reached the level of higher primary school or above. Among them, eighteen workers who were illiterate in the past have now been promoted to the level of technicians and engineers, and forty-three workers have been promoted to leadership positions. The improvement of workers' cultural level has promoted the current great leap forward in production. In the past, this factory could only produce a single variety, but since this year, it has been able to produce fourteen varieties, and the productivity has increased five times compared with the past.

    让每个工人都受到高等教育
    长春煤气公司创办化工学院
    生产和教育结合；工厂和学校结合；工人和学生结合；业余教育和半工半读并举
    本报讯　长春市煤气公司在长期坚持职工业余教育的基础上，创办化工学院，实现以生产为主，使生产和教育、工厂和学校、工人和学生密切结合；使业余学习与半工半读同时并举，逐步走向工厂和学校的完全合一。
    煤气公司的化工学院是在8月成立的，它包括研究、高级、中级、高小、技工五个部所组成的一个完整的教育体系。学院根据煤气公司生产的需要，已将全部职工分别组织在各部，分级、分系、分专业进行学习。研究部是由本公司十五年以上工龄的老工人、领导干部和吉林师范大学化学系讲师等组成，以老工人的经验结合生产中的关键性问题进行专题研究，总结成理论，指导生产，丰富各部教学，并且著书立论。按生产需要设置多种专业的高级部和中级部，吸收相当水平的职工，培养为专业工程师和专业技术员。刚脱盲的工人在高小部学习；技工部招收社会上的高小毕业生，为本厂培养技术工人。
    这个化工学院的正副院长，是由煤气公司的党委书记、经理和协作学校的校长担任。教员由本厂领导干部、专职文化教员、技术员、生产经验丰富的老工人和协作学校的部分教师担任，他们各人都参加一定学级的学习，同时又担任某一专业的教学工作。在教学中，他们根据生产特点、生产实际以及个人学习和研究心得，为各个专业编写教材。在化工学院现有的三十多个班中，有很多教员是富有生产经验的老工人。如曾经创造槽铁法制炭黑全国最高纪录的老工人卞玉忠，在生产之余，参加高级部学习，同时又担任中级部炭黑的教学。卞玉忠根据学习和生产经验，自编教案、讲义，在课堂上讲的是炭黑车间生产上的事，回到车间就一起进行实际操作，炭黑车间的工人学员们很快就领会接受了。
    化工学院的中级部已有一个班实行半工半读，新招的技工部的学生全部实行半工半读，高级部也将逐步实行半工半读。他们按照“统一学政治，分门学技术，分级学文化”的方法组织学习，提出：“政治是灵魂，技术做中心，文化跟上去，老工人著书立论”的口号，并确定学习目的是：“普遍提高，全面发展，又红又专，推动生产”。他们为了帮助厂外的学校开展勤工俭学活动，为社会培养更多人才，同时也解决化工学院部分班次实行半工半读所遇到的劳动力、师资、教材不足的困难，还和附近的第十中学实行了全面合作。煤气公司已帮助第十中学建立了两个化工厂，作为公司的“卫星”厂和学校的实习厂，并且派人作技术指导，协助解决供产销问题。第十中学帮助公司办技工部，组织半工半读学生到公司里参加劳动。
    化工学院紧紧围绕生产和技术关键问题进行科学研究和教学工作，并注意结合专业课安排基础课程。学院的高级和中级部都是根据专业课确定基础课程，对和专业联系不密切的课，则作为一般学习。研究部为了完成中共长春市委给的在年底前完成四万吨炼冶金焦炭的重大任务，确定了“怎样用水平炉炼冶金焦”、“怎样解决土窑炼焦及回收副产品”两个研究题目。经过两次讨论，解决了怎样利用原有水平炉和新建五十座土窑，在原材料缺乏的情况下，制造机械、利用代用品、副产品全部回收以及粉碎、筛、洗煤、干馏等一系列问题，使四万吨冶金焦的任务得到保证。现在已经开始炼出大批冶金焦炭，而且将陆续回收相当数量的煤气、焦油、炭黑等副产品。
    在中级部管路班学习的五十七个工人，过去安装煤气管道时，只有七个人能看懂图纸，现在都可以按图纸进行安装了。炭黑车间的工人们参加学习以后，产量已由过去每班四百公斤跃进到一千六百公斤，现正努力争取达到一千八百公斤以上。
    长春市煤气公司是一个具有三十多年历史的老企业，这个工厂老工人很多，但是，工人的文化水平很低。1952年全厂只有三个工人具有初中文化水平，文盲占职工总数的76％。厂里的技术很复杂，整个生产过程有85％以上属于技术操作，而厂里的技术人员极少，整个生产的技术指导几乎全部依靠老工人的实际经验。老工人对自己没有文化感到很苦恼。为了使老工人尽快地提高文化，改革技术，提高生产率，这个厂从1952年起就办起职工业余学校。现在，全厂所有工人都达到高小以上水平。其中有十八名过去是文盲的工人，现在已经提高到技术员和工程师的水平，有四十三名工人被提拔担任领导工作。工人文化水平的提高，促进了当前的生产大跃进。这个厂过去只能生产单一品种，今年以来，已能生产十四种品种，生产率比过去提高五倍。
