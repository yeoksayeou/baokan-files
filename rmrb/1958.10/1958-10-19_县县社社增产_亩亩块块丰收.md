This newspaper, Nanning, 18th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is stepping up the harvesting of mid-season rice. As of the 12th, more than 2.18 million mu of the region's more than 6 million mu of mid-season rice have been harvested, with an average yield of 701 jin per mu, an increase of 149% over last year. The Liuzhou Special District has harvested more than 470,000 mu of mid-season rice, with an average yield of 1,069 jin per mu, an increase of 291.5% over last year. Huanjiang County in this special district has harvested more than 82,000 mu, with an average yield of 4,010 jin per mu. The Guilin Special District has completed the harvesting of mid-season rice, with increased production in every county and commune, and bumper harvests on every mu and plot. Longsheng Autonomous County, a high and cold mountainous area, has an average yield of 1,500 jin per mu, an increase of two and a half times over last year.

There are 7 million laborers in the rural areas of the Autonomous Region. Since September, various localities have successively transferred 5 million laborers to the iron and steel production front. Due to the reduction of labor in the rear, the labor organization was somewhat disorganized, so some cadres and peasants had the idea of sitting back and waiting for help, shouting "the rear is empty, there is no way to do a good job in agricultural production." In order to harvest the mature mid-season rice in a timely manner, a large-scale debate was launched in early October to criticize this passive waiting mentality of sitting back and waiting for help, and every effort was made to tap the labor potential, mobilize all the people who could work, and arrange for reasonable use. Liucheng, Laibin, Shilong and other counties also launched mutual competitions between the front and rear to see who could launch a "satellite" first. After carrying out mutual competition, the 103 laborers of the Xiaotang Production Brigade of the Hongqi People's Commune in Nandan County went to work at 2:00 in the morning and returned at dark, increasing the harvesting efficiency by four times. After research, Du'an Yao Autonomous County adopted a method of combining charcoal burning, mining, and autumn harvest, concentrated its strength for large-scale collaboration, and harvested more than 75,000 mu in a concentrated attack for two days.

    县县社社增产　亩亩块块丰收
    本报南宁18日电　广西僮族自治区正在加紧收割中稻。到12日止，全区六百多万亩中稻已经收割二百十八万多亩，平均亩产七百零一斤，比去年增产149％。柳州专区已收割的四十七万多亩中稻，平均亩产一千零六十九斤，比去年增产291.5％。这个专区的环江县已收八万二千多亩，平均亩产四千零十斤。桂林专区中稻已全部收完，县县社社增产，亩亩块块丰收；高寒山区的龙胜各族自治县，平均亩产一千五百斤，比去年增产两倍半。
    自治区农村共有七百万个劳动力。从9月以来，各地先后抽调了五百万个劳动力到钢铁生产战线去。由于后方劳动力减少，劳动组织有些涣散，因而部分干部和农民就产生坐以待援思想，叫喊“后方空虚了，没法搞好农业生产”。为了及时把成熟的中稻收回来，10月初各地展开大辩论，批判了这种坐以待援的消极等待思想，千方百计地挖掘劳动潜力，把能劳动的人员都动员起来，合理安排使用。柳城、来宾、石龙等县还展开了前后方的互相竞赛，看谁先放“卫星”。南丹县红旗人民公社小塘生产大队一百零三个劳动力，开展互相竞赛后，早上两点钟出工，天黑收工，收割效率提高了四倍。都安瑶族自治县经过研究，采取烧炭、采矿与秋收相结合的办法，集中力量大协作，突击两天，就收割了七万五千多亩。
