South Korea: A Living Hell
By Wu Shoulin, Korea

The South Korean "Dawn" magazine in its January issue this year pointed out: If we analyze the pathology of South Korean society and write a diagnosis for it, it should read "Suffering from third-stage lung disease, on the verge of death."

Today, the vast majority of the South Korean people live a life worse than that of beasts of burden in a hell of unemployment, poverty, hunger, and disenfranchisement. According to survey data recently released by the so-called "Korean-American Economic Cooperation Committee," cobbled together by the United States to control South Korea's economic lifeline, the number of unemployed in South Korea today has increased to 4.2 million. This number is more than 220,000 more than the combined population of Norway, Luxembourg, Monaco, Greenland, and Iceland.

According to statistics from the Lee Seung-man authorities and South Korean newspapers, which are obviously understated, there are more than 600,000 women in South Korea today who have no way to make a living, and hundreds of thousands of orphans who have no one to rely on. These unemployed people, women, and orphans are displaced all over South Korea, looking for ways to survive. In addition, there are more than three million patients of various diseases who are groaning and cannot get any treatment; and as many as 500,000 people who have lost their ability to work and must be given relief. There are also more than three million vagrants who live under bridges and eaves, barely sheltering from the wind and rain because they have nowhere to live. We do not need to explain much about the situation of these people, what kind of misfortune and pain they have suffered. The Seoul correspondent of the British magazine "The Economist" wrote in his article: "Koreans (i.e., the South Korean people) are still at the bottom of the human pyramid, and anyone will shed tears of sympathy for them." As he wrote, today in South Korea there are shocking or tearful tragedies everywhere due to serious difficulties in life.

Kim Jeong-ok, a woman living in Hyoja-dong, Seoul, recently committed suicide by poisoning herself along with her nine-year-old son because she could not survive. Yun Hak-chul, a worker at the Obong Mine in Gyeongsangbuk-do, worked so hard that his back was bent, but his family was always underfed and poorly clothed. In despair, he committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. Ahn Ju-mae, a resident of Seungseong-ri, June-myeon, Yangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do, had been starving for days. Her five-year-old son was dying of hunger. The mother's heart was cut like a knife, and she couldn't bear to watch, so she cruelly strangled her own son and then tried to commit suicide but was rescued. Such tragedies are everywhere in South Korea today, becoming more and more tragic, and increasing day by day.

A Swedish journalist who once visited South Korea published an article in the "Swedish News" entitled "I Toured a Living Hell," in which he wrote:

"No matter how you come to South Korea with unusual imagination and mental preparation, you will be frightened by unexpected misery and unforeseen cruel poverty and disaster."

We Korean people fully know that the root of all this misfortune lies entirely in the American aggressors' occupation of South Korea, turning South Korea into their colony.

Since occupying South Korea, the U.S. imperialists have made full use of the Lee Seung-man puppet government to pursue a war policy and, in the name of "aid," have continuously exported surplus commodities to South Korea, destroying and crushing South Korea's national industry and rural economy, and frantically squeezing super profits. In the past thirteen years, the U.S. imperialists' so-called "aid" has been shockingly destructive to the South Korean economy.

In 1957, South Korea's total industrial output value fell to 63% of the 1940 level. At the end of Japanese rule, the output of pig iron, although pitifully small, was still 3,700 tons, but even this level cannot be reached this year.

According to South Korean newspapers, from 1955 to 1957, more than 2,500 small and medium-sized factories and enterprises declared bankruptcy due to difficulties in raw materials, funds, and sales. According to Reuters, 60% to 80% of South Korean industrial equipment has stopped operating or shortened production time.

In South Korea, workers who are fortunate enough not to be unemployed are forced to engage in slave-like labor all day long. According to the Dongyang News Agency, more than 600 workers in various factories in Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do, work under the supervision and coercion of 106 Americans, police, and factory police, like beasts of burden, but their wages are not even one-third of the minimum living expenses; what is worse is that they cannot even receive such a small amount of wages in a timely manner. The Lee Seung-man government-operated enterprises owed wages of up to 2.1 billion won (South Korean currency) in June this year.

Let's take a look at the situation of the South Korean rural economy! At present, the sown area in South Korea has been reduced by 600,000 hectares compared with the Japanese rule period, and the total grain output has been reduced by 40%. As a result, South Korea, once known as a "granary," has long become a famine area, and it is necessary to import more than 5 million stones of grain every year. Chronic famine has spread throughout South Korea, and millions of farmers who have run out of food eat grass roots and tree bark every day to eke out a living.

The South Korean people are suffering from countless disasters. Under the police terror rule of the U.S. and Lee, the South Korean people have lost all rights and freedoms, and the youth have lost all learning conditions. The U.S. and Lee clique forcibly conscript young people to be cannon fodder and kill the South Korean people at will.

U.S. soldiers shot and killed a three-year-old child in Incheon, South Korea, and called him a thief! The U.S. military police suddenly attacked the village of Paju in broad daylight, killing, setting fires, and doing everything.

A Western journalist, in talking about the barbaric behavior of the U.S. military in South Korea, wrote: "Like on a deserted island, the leather shoes of the U.S. military trample on Korea (South Korea). Wherever they go, factories have to stop working and villages have to be burned. Koreans are nothing in the eyes of American soldiers, just like what the ancestors of the U.S. military did in the Americas more than a hundred years ago, they eliminate the aborigines when they see them. Today, the Koreans spoken of here (South Korea) are just targets for American clumsy gunners."

In the past thirteen years, the U.S. aggressors have turned South Korea into a living hell. It is precisely because of this that the anti-American and anti-Lee Seung-man struggle is rising in South Korea today.

The Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have repeatedly proposed plans for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland in order to unify the divided territory and save the southern compatriots. However, due to the consistent obstruction of the U.S. and Lee clique, the Korean people's heartfelt desire—the peaceful reunification of the fatherland—has not yet been realized, and the southern people continue to be trapped in the hell of hunger, poverty, and disenfranchisement.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always made unremitting efforts for the unification and independence of the fatherland and the freedom and happiness of the people. Based on the tremendous achievements in the economy, it made a decision on August 21: to provide the south with 150,000 stones of white rice, 5 million meters of textiles, 10,000 tons of aquatic products, and 4 million pairs of shoes free of charge in order to relieve the unemployed and homeless orphans in the south. It is also willing to adopt all the homeless orphans in the south and provide a monthly scholarship of 1,000 won per person to 3,000 college students in the south for a long period of time. Today, the people in the north are working hard to realize this decision. However, the heinous U.S. and Lee clique, as before, obstruct this helping hand extended from brotherly love to relieve suffering compatriots.

We Korean people have once again recognized from this fact that U.S. imperialism and its running dog Lee Seung-man are the irreconcilable enemies of the Korean people. The Korean people are determined to drive U.S. imperialism out of South Korea in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

    人间地狱南朝鲜
    朝鲜　吴寿麟
    今年一月号的南朝鲜“黎明”杂志指出：如果分析南朝鲜社会的病理，而给它写一份诊断书的话，就应该写成“患第三期肺病，濒于死亡。”
    今天，南朝鲜广大人民，在失业、贫穷、饥饿和丧失权利的地狱中，过着牛马不如的生活。根据美国为控制南朝鲜经济命脉而拼凑的所谓“韩美经济合作委员会”不久前发表的调查资料，今天南朝鲜的失业者已增加到四百二十万人。这个数字竟比挪威、卢森堡、摩纳哥、格陵兰、冰岛这五国加在一起的人口还要多二十多万人。
    根据李承晚当局和南朝鲜报刊显然缩小了的统计数字，今天南朝鲜生活无路的妇女有六 十多万，无倚无靠的孤儿也有几十万。这些失业者，妇女和孤儿在南朝鲜各地流离失所，到处寻找活路。此外，还有三百多万各种病人在呻吟，而得不到任何治疗；而丧失了劳动能力、必须加以救济的人也达五十万之多。还因无家可归而住在桥底下、房檐底下勉强避风躲雨的流浪者，也超过了三百万人。关于这些人的处境如何，受到了什么样的不幸和痛苦，我们不需要作很多的说明。英国“经济学家”杂志驻汉城记者在自己的文章中写道：“韩国人（即南朝鲜人民）还处在人间金字塔的最下层，不管是任何人，都会含泪寄予他们同情。”正如他所写的那样，今天在南朝鲜到处都有因严重的生活困难而发生使人震惊或令人流泪的悲剧。
    住在汉城孝子洞的妇女金贞玉，因为无法活下去，最近终于同九岁的儿子一起服毒自杀。庆尚北道五峰矿山的工人云学出，干活儿干得腰都要弯了，但全家人总是穿不暖吃不饱，他在悲观之余，竟投河自杀了。京畿道杨州郡州内面上升里居民安珠妹，一连饿了好几天，五岁的儿子饿得奄奄一息，母亲心痛如割，实在目不忍睹，就狠心勒死了亲生的儿子，再去自杀而遇救。这样的悲剧，今天在南朝鲜到处都是，越来越悲惨，而且与日俱增。
    一个曾经访问过南朝鲜的瑞典记者，在“瑞典新闻”上发表了一篇题为“我巡视了一下活地狱”的文章，在这文章中有一段写道：
    “不管你怎样带着异于寻常的想像和精神准备来到南朝鲜，也会为出乎意外的凄惨现象和预料不到的残酷的贫困和灾难所吓倒。”
    我们朝鲜人民完全知道，这一切不幸的根源完全在于美国侵略者强占了南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成了他们的殖民地。
    美帝国主义自从占领南朝鲜以来，充分利用李承晚傀儡政府奉行战争政策，并以“援助”为名，源源向南朝鲜输出剩余商品，破坏并挤垮了南朝鲜的民族工业和农村经济，疯狂地压榨超额利润。十三年来，美帝国主义的所谓“援助”，对南朝鲜经济的破坏是惊人的。
    1957年南朝鲜的工业总产值降到了1940年水平的63％。在日本统治末期，生铁的产量虽然少得可怜，但是还有三千七百吨，而今年连这样的水平也达不到了。
    据南朝鲜报刊报道，从1955年到1957年，就有二千五百多家中小工厂企业因原料、资金、销路等方面的困难而宣告破产。据路透社报道，南朝鲜工业设备有60％到80％已经停止运转或缩短生产时间。
    在南朝鲜，侥幸没有失业的工人，终日被迫进行着奴隶般的劳动。据东洋通讯社报道，忠清北道忠州市各工厂的六百多工人，在一百零六个美国人、警察和厂警等的监视和逼迫下劳动，如同牛马，但他们的工资却不敷最低生活费的三分之一；更糟的是他们连这么一点工资也不能及时领到。李承晚政府直接经营的企业，今年6月里就积欠工资达二十一亿圆（南朝鲜币）。
    再看一看南朝鲜农村经济的情况吧！目前南朝鲜播种面积已较日本统治时期减少了六十万公顷，谷物总产量减少了40％。这样，曾经以“粮仓”著称的南朝鲜，早已变成了饥馑地区，每年非进口五百万石以上粮食不可。慢性饥馑已蔓延整个南朝鲜，数百万断粮农民，镇日吃草根树皮以苟延残喘。
    南朝鲜人民灾难重重。在美李的警察恐怖统治下，南朝鲜人民丧失了一切权利和自由，青年们丧失了一切学习条件。美李集团强征青年们去当炮灰，并且随意残杀南朝鲜人民。
    美国兵在南朝鲜仁川枪杀了一个三岁小孩，竟把他说成是小偷！美国宪兵部队在光天化日之下，突然袭击了坡州村庄，杀人放火，无所不为。
    一位西方国家记者，在谈到美军在南朝鲜的野蛮行为时写道：“就像在无人岛上那样，美军的皮鞋踏遍着韩国（南朝鲜），他们走到哪里，哪里的工厂就要停工，村庄就要被烧。韩国人在美国兵的眼里算不了什么，就像美军的祖先们早在一百多年前在美洲大陆上所做的一样，他们看到土人就加以消灭。今天在这里（南朝鲜）所说的韩国人，不过是美国笨炮手打靶的目标而已。”
    在过去的十三年间，美国侵略者已把南朝鲜变成人间地狱。正是因为这样，今天在南朝鲜反美反李承晚的斗争日趋高涨。
    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，为统一分裂的国土，为拯救南部同胞，屡次提出和平统一祖国的方案。但是由于美李集团一贯的阻挠，朝鲜人民的切身愿望——祖国和平统一尚未实现，南部人民继续陷于饥饿、贫穷和丧失权利的地狱中。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一向为祖国的统一、独立和人民的自由、幸福而进行不懈的努力，并在经济上获得巨大成就的基础上，在8月21日作出决定：为救济南部的失业者和流浪孤儿，而无偿地向南部提供十五万石白米、五百万公尺纺织品、一万吨水产品和四百万双鞋子，并愿收养南部的所有流浪孤儿和对南部三千名大学生长期地每月支给每人一千圆奖学金。今天，北部人民正在为实现这项决定而努力。但是，穷凶极恶的美李集团仍然同从前一样，对这种从同胞爱出发、为救济苦难的同胞而伸出去的援助之手横加阻拦。
    我们朝鲜人民从这一事实再一次认清，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚是朝鲜人民不共戴天的仇人。朝鲜人民决心要把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜，以实现祖国的和平统一。
