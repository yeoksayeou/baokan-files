    Granny Factory

    The Zhuhe Town in Jianli County, Hubei Province, recently established a cloth shoe upper factory. All the workers in the factory are fourteen gray-haired, lonely old women. Before liberation, these old women lived by begging and their lives were very difficult. After liberation, they were able to maintain their lives only with government relief. During the Great Leap Forward, these old women refused to live solely on government relief and asked the government to help them establish this factory.

    On the day the cloth shoe upper factory started, the sky was just dawning, and the old women happily went to work. On that day, they made more than 30 pieces of cloth shoe uppers. Now, they can make more than 80 pieces every day. The factory's income, after retaining a portion for the public accumulation fund, is used as wages for the old women, which are paid every five days. In this way, not only has wealth been added to the country, but also their lives have been improved. Therefore, since the start of work, every old woman has been chanting about repaying the Party and the government for their kindness. Grandma Gong, who is seventy-eight years old, said: "Before liberation, we lacked food, clothing, and housing. After liberation, the government sent relief funds to our doorsteps, and now they have found a way for us to produce. Although we are old, we must contribute to socialism." (Attached picture)

    老婆婆工厂
    湖北省监利县的朱河镇，最近办了一个布壳（做鞋用的）厂，全厂的工人是十四个白发苍苍的孤老婆婆。解放前，这些老婆婆都靠行乞度日，生活很困苦；解放后也是靠政府救济才能维持生活。在大跃进中，这些老婆婆们说什么也不愿意单靠政府救济生活了，便要求政府帮助她们建立了这个工厂。
    布壳厂开工的那一天，天刚蒙蒙亮，老婆婆们就喜气洋洋地去上工了。这一天，她们一共做了三十多块布壳；现在，她们每天已经能做八十多块了。厂里的收入除留一部分公积金外，其余的都作为老婆婆们的工资，每五天发一次。这样，不但为国家增加了财富，也改善了她们的生活。因此，从开工到现在，每个老婆婆都天天念道着要报答党和政府给她们的恩情。七十八岁的龚妈妈说：“解放前缺吃少穿没房住，解放后政府把救济款送上门，现在又给我们找到了生产门路，我们虽然老了，可一定要为社会主义出点力气。”（附图片）
