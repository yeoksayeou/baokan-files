Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd: Jiangsu Province has launched a high-yield iron and steel movement starting from the 15th. In the week up to the 21st, the province's daily pig iron production stabilized at around 3,831 tons, a twofold increase compared to the daily production of the seven days prior. Steel production also experienced a significant leap forward.

Jiangsu Province achieved this result under extremely difficult conditions of coal and iron ore shortages. Wherever there was coal or ore, localities mobilized thousands upon thousands of people to mine and transport it. The entire province launched a technical revolution movement centered on conserving coal, making every effort to reduce coal consumption and fully tap into the potential of coal, enabling the blast furnaces put into production to be fully fed.

In the past week, indigenous steelmaking methods in Jiangsu Province have developed from scattered efforts to a full-blown widespread movement. The experience of low-temperature steelmaking in Henan has been universally promoted. Nanjing alone built 2,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces in a matter of days, with a peak daily output of 445 tons. Various indigenous open-hearth furnaces and indigenous converters have also been created in various places.

Currently, various localities are making every effort to solve the difficulties of coal and ore self-reliantly, continuing to advance victoriously.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 23rd: Jiangxi Province's people overcame continuous rain and raised the average daily pig iron production to more than 3,270 tons during the "Leap Forward Week" for iron and steel from the 15th to the 21st, more than doubling the average daily production of the first half of the month.

Before the start of the "Leap Forward Week," all parts of Jiangxi unfolded extensive discussions, full airing of views, and great debates on the significance and requirements for ensuring the completion of the state's iron and steel production plan. As a result, the more than two million strong army of iron and steel workers were all highly motivated, battling through wind, cold, and rain, working tirelessly day and night at the furnaces, mining sites, and transportation lines. They said, "No matter how cold the weather, it cannot stop our determination to seize iron and steel!" During the Iron and Steel Leap Forward Week, all localities organized comprehensive breakthroughs targeting the weak links in production, especially focusing on coal and coke production, ensuring that wherever there was coal, they would dig it, and wherever the coal was good, they would go there, ensuring the fuel needs of the indigenous blast furnaces.

In order to achieve the requirement of "striving for every ounce of steel and not losing a single grain of food," Party committees at all levels from the province to the township and commune went all out. Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries of the Secretariat Shao Shiping, Fang Zhichun, and Liu Junxi personally went to various counties in the Ganzhou, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Shangrao and other regions to supervise the battle, helping various localities to rationally arrange labor. Therefore, while iron and steel achieved high yields, the province's winter planting work also achieved remarkable results.

    针对薄弱环节组织全面突击
    江苏江西铁产量提高两倍
    新华社南京23日电　江苏省从15日开始开展了钢铁高额丰产运动。到21日为止的一周里，全省生铁日产量稳定在三千八百三十一吨左右，比这七天以前的日产量增涨二倍；钢的产量也有显著的跃进。
    江苏省的这一成绩，是在煤与铁矿石万分困难的情况下获得的。各地凡是有煤、有矿的地区，都发动成千上万的人上山采矿、挖煤，边采边运。全省开展了一个以节约用煤为中心的技术革命运动，千方百计地降低煤耗，充分挖掘了煤的潜力，使投入生产的高炉得以吃饱。
    一周来，江苏省的土法炼钢，已经从星星点点发展成全面开花，各地普遍推广了河南低温炼钢的经验，仅南京市在几天内就建成了两千座土炼钢炉，最高日产量达到四百四十五吨。各地还创造了各种土平炉、土转炉。
    目前，各地正千方百计地自力更生解决煤和矿石的困难，继续乘胜前进。
    新华社南昌23日电　江西省人民战胜了连绵的阴雨，在15日到21日的钢铁跃进周中，把生铁平均日产量提高到了三千二百七十多吨，比本月上半月平均日产量提高了两倍多。
    江西各地在“跃进周”开始前，对保证完成国家钢铁生产计划的意义和要求，展开了广泛的大鸣、大放、大辩论，因此，二百多万钢铁大军个个情绪高涨，冒着风寒雨露，彻夜苦战在炉前、采矿场和运输线上。他们说：“天再冷，也挡不住我们夺取钢铁的心”。各地在钢铁跃进周中针对生产上的薄弱环节，组织了全面突击，特别是抓紧了煤焦生产，做到了哪里有煤就到哪里挖，哪里煤好就到哪里去，保证了土高炉的燃料需要。
    为了实现“钢铁斤两必争，粮食颗粒不丢”的要求，从省到乡、社各级党委都全力以赴。省委第一书记杨尚奎、书记处书记邵式平、方志纯、刘俊秀等都亲往赣南、九江、吉安、上饶等专区各县督战，帮助各地合理安排劳力。因此，在钢铁获得高产的同时，全省冬种工作也获得了显著成绩。
