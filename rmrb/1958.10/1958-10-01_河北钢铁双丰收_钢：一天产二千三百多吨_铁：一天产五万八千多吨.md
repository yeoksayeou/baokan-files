Our Tianjin Dispatch, 30th—On the eve of National Day, Hebei Province has launched high-yield "satellites" in both iron and steel production. On the 29th, the province's daily iron production reached 58,300 tons, and daily steel production reached 2,328 tons. Among the regions in the province, Baoding Special District produced over 20,000 tons of iron per day, while Handan, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang Special Districts each produced over 10,000 tons. Twenty-four counties and cities, including Wu'an and Zhangjiakou City, produced over 1,000 tons of iron per day. The Chengguan and Wuji People's Communes in Wu'an County, and the Hongqi People's Commune in Yuanshi County, also achieved a daily iron production of over 1,000 tons.

The main reason Hebei Province was able to launch such high-yield satellites in a short period is that Party committees at all levels have implemented the policy of utilizing both indigenous and foreign methods, and combining them. After the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call on September 17th to produce 10,000 tons of iron per day to greet National Day, Party committees at all levels mobilized the masses to launch airing of views and debates, powerfully criticizing the idea of valuing foreign methods over indigenous ones. Various localities put forward the battle cry of "Catch up with Lushan, surpass Wu'an, determined to achieve 10,000-ton Special Districts and 1,000-ton Counties, and present gifts before National Day." The entire province formed a steel army of more than 4.5 million people, fighting day and night without rest. Another factor in launching high-yield satellites is that Party committees at all levels went all out to solve key problems, mobilizing all available forces to resolutely break through wherever difficulties arose. With a large number of indigenous furnaces put into production in various places, the need for coal and ore increased sharply, and many areas immediately launched a mass movement focusing on crash mining and increased coal production.

### 河北钢铁双丰收  钢：一天产二千三百多吨  铁：一天产五万八千多吨

    河北钢铁双丰收
    钢：一天产二千三百多吨  铁：一天产五万八千多吨
    本报天津30日电　国庆节前夕，河北省在炼铁、炼钢方面都放射出了高产卫星。29日，全省日产铁五万八千三百吨，日产钢两千三百二十八吨。全省日产铁二万吨以上的有保定专区，一万吨以上的有邯郸、张家口、石家庄三个专区；日产铁千吨以上的，有武安、张家口市等二十四个县市。武安县的城关、午汲和元氏县的红旗等三个人民公社，日产铁也达到千吨以上。
    河北省在短时期内，能够放射出这样的高产卫星，主要是由于各级党委贯彻执行了土洋并举、土洋结合方针的结果。9月17日，中共河北省委提出日产万吨铁迎接国庆节的号召以后，各级党委发动群众展开了鸣放、辩论，有力地批判了轻土重洋的思想。各地提出：“赶鲁山、超武安，决心实现万吨专、千吨县，国庆节前把礼献”的战斗口号，全省组成四百五十多万人的钢铁大军，日夜奋战不息。放射出高产大卫星的另一个因素，是各级党委全力以赴，突击解决关键问题，那里有困难，就调动一切可以调动的力量，坚决突破。各地大批的土炉投入生产，煤炭、矿石的需要骤增，很多地区立即掀起一个以突击采矿、增产煤炭为主的群众运动。
