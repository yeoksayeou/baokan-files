Last Year's Highest Cotton Record
The highest cotton yield record in 1957 was 1,467 jin of seed cotton, equivalent to about 500 jin of ginned cotton. This record was created by the Yu Aihua group of the 21st Farm in the Usu Reclamation Area of Xinjiang. The area of this high-yield field was 1.8 mu. In the southern cotton-growing area, the He Luo Agricultural Cooperative in Yicheng County, Hubei Province, also achieved a high yield that was only slightly lower than the Yu Aihua group, by about 30 jin of seed cotton. Both of these production units planted single-season cotton fields.

    去年的棉花最高纪录
    1957年棉花单产最高纪录是籽棉一千四百六十七斤，约合皮棉五百斤左右。创造这个纪录的是新疆乌苏垦区二十一农场于爱花小组，这块丰产田面积是一亩八分。南方棉区的湖北宜城县何骆农业社去年也获得比于爱花小组仅低籽棉三十多斤的高产成绩。这两个生产单位种植的都是一熟棉田。
