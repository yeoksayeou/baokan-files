Wherever There Are People, There Are Doctors and Medicine
A Preliminary Rural Medical and Health Care Network Formed in Most Parts of the Country

(Our reporter Zhang Guoning reports) The people-run rural medical and health undertakings across the country have seen rapid development in the past six months. According to incomplete statistics from 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, the number of people-run rural maternity hospitals and hospitals has grown to more than 58,000. A socialist rural medical and health care network has been initially formed in most parts of the country, gradually realizing the goal of "wherever there are people, there are doctors and medicine." People-run rural medical and health services are playing a significant role in protecting the health of all people and promoting production.

Relying on the leadership of the Party, grassroots Party and government cadres and health cadres in various places have continuously criticized right-leaning conservative ideas such as "regularization," "conditionalism," and "emphasizing state-run and de-emphasizing people-run." This has liberated the minds of many cadres, broken down superstitions, and, based on the needs of the Great Leap Forward and the urgent demands of the masses, adhered to the principles of serving production, relying on the masses, mobilizing the whole Party and all the people, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results through the "walking on two legs" approach to vigorously develop people-run medical and health services. In 75 counties in Shaanxi Province, including Jingyang, Xianyang, and Liquan, the Party committee secretaries at all levels took the lead, vigorously publicizing and mobilizing the masses, and explaining the benefits of maternal and child safety, labor savings, and comparisons between the past and present. This made the masses realize that people-run health institutions could provide nearby treatment and were beneficial to production. Therefore, they were very enthusiastic about establishing maternity hospitals and hospitals. These 75 counties, after two or three months or just over ten days of hard work, achieved the goal of having maternity hospitals in every township and commune. The number of people-run rural maternity hospitals and hospitals in the province has increased dramatically from dozens last year to more than 6,000. In Gansu Province, the number of people-run hospitals and maternity hospitals has rapidly grown to more than 5,000 in the past few months. People-run health services have also been developing vigorously in many ethnic minority areas and remote mountainous areas. Yongshun County, Hunan Province, is a region inhabited by the Tujia ethnic group. Before liberation, there was only one health institution here that served the landlord class. This year, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole county worked hard and established 34 rural hospitals in just over 20 days. All agricultural cooperatives have established health clinics, and all production teams have health workers, basically realizing the goal of "wherever there are people, there are doctors and medicine."

In the process of establishing maternity hospitals and hospitals in various places, the masses have enthusiastically donated labor and materials, and lent their surplus houses and furniture to the communes for use. In many places, maternity hospitals and hospitals were established by each household donating a few strands of thread or a few eggs. When the seven agricultural cooperatives in Baiwang Township, Jingyang County, Shaanxi, established a maternity hospital, after discussion, the women proposed the slogan: "One egg per person, don't ask the commune for a penny, women build the maternity hospital themselves." In five days, they donated more than 35,000 eggs, helping to establish maternity hospitals and hospitals. A considerable portion of the medicines and equipment used in the more than 90 rural hospitals established in Huanjiang County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region this year were self-made, and most used local herbal medicines, which were self-collected and self-produced. This saved money and treated diseases.

The great development of people-run rural health services plays a significant role in popularizing health knowledge, changing customs, protecting people's health, and promoting production. Maternity hospitals in various places have made significant achievements in popularizing modern midwifery and other work. The use of modern midwifery in Gansu, Hebei, Ningxia, and other places has increased from about 70% last year to about 90% this year. In Xihe County, Gansu, which is located in a high-altitude mountainous area, the infant mortality rate used to be very high. Now, this county has established more than 300 maternity hospitals, and the rate of modern midwifery has reached 96%. People-run health institutions in various places have also implemented the policy of "prevention first." After building more than 340 rural maternity hospitals and hospitals this year, Xiao County, Anhui, has not only treated more than 670 patients and received more than 300 maternity cases in a few months, but also regularly gone deep into the fields and farmers' homes to carry out disease prevention and control work. Many rural hospitals have also established disease patrol systems and epidemic reporting systems, and promptly prevent and control infectious diseases. (Attached photo)

    哪里有人　哪里有医有药
    全国多数地区初步形成农村医药卫生保健网
    本报讯　记者张国宁报道：全国农村民办医药卫生事业半年多来有了飞跃发展。据全国二十个省、市和自治区不完全统计，民办农村产院和医院已经发展到五万八千多所。社会主义的农村医药卫生保健网在全国多数地区已初步形成，逐渐实现了“哪里有人，哪里有医有药”。民办农村医疗卫生事业对保护全民身体健康，促进生产发生着重大作用。
    各地基层党政干部和卫生干部依靠党的领导，不断批判了“正规化”、“条件论”、“重公办轻民办”等右倾保守思想，使许多干部解放了思想，破除了迷信，而根据大跃进形势的需要和群众迫切要求，坚持面向生产、依靠群众、全党全民动手和两条腿走路的多快好省的方针，大力发展民办医疗卫生事业。陕西省泾阳、咸阳、醴泉等七十五个县各级党委书记挂帅，大力宣传和发动群众，向群众算母子平安账、节省劳力账和今昔对比账等三笔账，使群众认识到民办卫生机构能够就近治疗，有利生产，因此，他们对办产院、医院的积极性很高。这七十五个县经过两三个月或十多天的奋战就实现了乡乡社社有产院。全省民办农村产院、医院由去年的几十所激增到六千多所。甘肃省几个月来民办医院和产院迅速发展到五千多所。许多少数民族地区和边远山区民办卫生事业也蓬勃地发展起来。湖南省永顺县是土家族居住地区，解放前这里只有一所为地主阶级服务的卫生机构，今年党领导全县人民大干特干，只二十多天时间就建立了三十四所农村医院。各农业社都成立了保健室，各生产队有了卫生员，基本上实现了“哪里有人，哪里有医有药”。
    各地在建立产院和医院工作中，群众纷纷献工献料，把自己多余的房屋和家具借给社里使用，许多地方都是由每户捐出几缕线或几个鸡蛋而办起了产院、医院。陕西泾阳县白王乡七个农业社在建立产院时，经过讨论，妇女们提出：“一人一个鸡蛋，不要社里一文钱，妇女自己建产院”的口号，五天就捐献出鸡蛋三万五千多个，帮助建立产院和医院。广西僮族自治区环江县今年办的九十多所农村医院相当一部分药品器械都是自己仿造，大部分采用本地草药，自采、自制。既省了钱，又治了病。
    农村民办卫生事业的大发展，对于普及卫生知识，移风易俗，保护人民健康和促进生产起着重大作用。各地产院在普及新法接生等工作中做出了显著成绩。甘肃、河北、宁夏等地今年用新法接生由去年的70％增加到90％左右。处于高寒山区的甘肃西和县过去婴儿死亡率很高，现在这个县办起了三百多处产院，新法接生达到96％。各地民办卫生机构还贯彻了“预防为主”的方针。安徽萧县今年建成三百四十多所农村产院和医院后，几个月中间除收治病人六百七十多人和接纳了三百多名产妇分娩外，还经常深入田间、农户进行疾病防治工作。许多农村医院还建立了疾病巡视制度和疫情报告制度，发现传染病及时防治。（附图片）
