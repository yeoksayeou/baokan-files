    Refining High-Quality Steel from a Young Age
    Bai Lu
    Our Party loves children and always regards them as successors to the socialist and communist cause. Our motherland's magnificent future belongs to all of us now, but even more so to the children. They will make great achievements in the motherland's communist cause, achievements that we cannot make. Schools are for nurturing children. The school's responsibility is to cultivate new successors according to the Party's instructions and to fully embody the Party's care and love in the children.
    How should we nurture children? Should we cultivate them in a greenhouse into delicate, weak flowers? Or should we put them by the steel furnace to temper them into steel? The former approach is actually harming them. Flowers in a greenhouse cannot withstand wind and rain. What use is a weak scholar to the country and humanity? The latter method is true care and love for them, so that they can be tempered into steel.
    Can children work? The answer should be yes. Labor is a bitter chore for exploiters; but for working people, it is a need in life, an adaptation to general natural laws; the same is true for pure children. Only since the exploiting class opposed mental and physical labor has labor been regarded as a hard service. Today, the "Young Pioneers" under the Party's education, the conscious young pioneers, have already begun to regard productive labor as a conscious activity, happily and proudly spending a happy childhood. Four thousand young children in Luoyang, under the guidance of teachers, established the Young Pioneer Steel Plant and joined the people of the whole country to "send the steel commander to take command." What a heroic act this is!
    Some people also raise questions with good intentions, "Will labor damage children's health?" We say that there are many kinds of labor that can be adapted to the age and physical strength of children, arranging rhythmic labor for them. In rhythmic labor, it will only promote the health of children and strengthen their physical strength. Of course, without this kind of rhythmic labor, the development of children cannot be complete, and their physique cannot be healthy. In the Luoyang Young Pioneer Steel Plant, we can see those who can pick up iron, pick up iron, those who can pan sand, pan sand, those who can pick up firewood, pick up firewood, those who can make sand molds, make sand molds, those who can forge, forge, those who can move two taels, move two taels, those who can take half a catty, take half a catty. This is a happy and lively concert of young laborers. Party organizations in schools have a responsibility to ensure that children's physical and mental health is healthier and to fight against phenomena that harm children's physical and mental health from different aspects.
    Refining steel and refining people! The Young Pioneer Steel Plant can add its own numbers to the 10.07 million tons of steel, which is truly something to be proud of! But what is even more worthy of pride is to train oneself to become a cultured laborer with socialist consciousness. The Party's education serves the politics of the proletariat. The policy of combining education with productive labor applies to universities, middle schools, and primary schools. This is the only correct policy. If all 117.59 million primary school students in the country can be trained to become glorious laborers in the combination of education and productive labor, and tempered into high-quality steel from an early age, then we can imagine that under the shining light of the Party, they will become outstanding heroes in the construction of communism.

    从小炼成优质钢
    白路
    我们党是热爱少年儿童的，一向把儿童当作社会主义和共产主义事业的接班人。我们祖国的壮丽的未来，是属于我们现在所有的人的，但是，更多的是属于少年儿童的。他们将在祖国的共产主义事业中，做出我们所做不出来的丰功伟绩。学校是培养少年儿童的。学校的责任，就是要按照党的指示，去培养新的接班人，把党的关怀和爱护在少年儿童的身上充分体现出来。
    怎样去培养少年儿童？把他们放在温室中培养成弱不禁风的花朵呢？还是把他们放在炼钢炉边百炼成钢呢？前一种做法实际上是害了他们。温室中的花朵经不起狂风骤雨，一个文弱书生对祖国，对人类有什么用处？后一种办法是真正关怀他们，爱护他们，才能使他们百炼成钢。
    少年儿童能不能劳动呢？回答应当是肯定的。劳动对于剥削者来说，是一件苦差事；而对于劳动人民来说，则是人生的需要，是对于一般自然规律的适应；对于纯洁的少年儿童来说，也是如此。只是从剥削阶级把脑力劳动与体力劳动对立起来的时候起，劳动才被看作是苦役。今天在党教育下的“红领巾”，有觉悟的少年儿童先锋队员们，已经开始把生产劳动作为自觉的活动，愉快而骄傲地度着幸福的童年。洛阳四千多少年儿童，在教师的指导下，建立了红领巾钢铁厂，同全国人民一道，来“送钢帅升帐”，这是多么豪迈的举动啊！
    也有些人怀着好心提出疑问，“劳动会不会损害儿童的健康？”我们说有许多劳动是能和儿童的年龄和体力相适应的，给他们安排有节奏的劳动。在有节奏的劳动中，只会促进少年儿童身体的健康，增强他们的体力。当然，如果没有这种有节奏的劳动，就不能使少年儿童的发育完全，体格健美。在洛阳红领巾钢铁厂，我们可以看到，能拾铁的拾铁，能淘沙的淘沙，能捡木柴的捡木柴，能做砂型的做砂型，能锻造的锻造，能动二两的动二两，能拿半斤的拿半斤。这是一支快乐的、活泼的少年儿童劳动者的合奏曲。学校中的党组织有责任来保证少年儿童的身心更加健康，并且同那种从不同方面来的损害少年儿童身心健康的现象作斗争。
    炼钢又炼人！红领巾钢铁厂能在一千零七十万吨钢中加上自己的数字，真正足以自豪啊！但更值得自豪的是把自己锻炼成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动结合的方针既适用于大学也适用于中学和小学。这是唯一的正确的方针。如果全国一亿一千七百五十九万小学生，都能在教育结合生产劳动中培养成为光荣的劳动者，从小就锻炼成为优质钢，那我们可以想像，在党的光辉的照耀下，他们将成为共产主义建设的出色的英雄人物。
