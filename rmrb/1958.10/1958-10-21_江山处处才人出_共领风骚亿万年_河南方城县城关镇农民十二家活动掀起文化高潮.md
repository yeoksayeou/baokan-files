Cultural flowers bloom in unison, facing the sun in a riot of color;
Men and women, young and old, sing joyfully, their leap forward songs resounding in all directions.

This is a poem written by farmer-writers in Chengguan Town, Fangcheng County, Henan Province. The cultural leap forward, centered around the Twelve-Family Activities, has greatly promoted the overall leap forward centered on industrial and agricultural production, bringing about profound changes in the town.

A Cultural Wind Sweeps Across the Town
Twelve Families Emerge in Succession

Chengguan Town, Fangcheng County, achieved the goal of becoming an illiteracy-free town on March 23. After eliminating illiteracy, it immediately put forward the fighting goal of "Igniting the leap forward fire, burning away cultural illiteracy, working hard for half a month, and achieving the goal of becoming a cultural town by May 1st." This call immediately turned into action by the masses, who began singing jingles such as "Whirr, whirr, whirr, pay attention to hygiene, learn culture, and play in the club; Fear nothing, fear no one, be able to speak with a pen in hand, be literate yesterday, write essays today, and become writers tomorrow; To realize a cultural town, first realize a cultural family, see who runs ahead, who will take the red flag.” Encouraged by these action slogans, a nationwide cultural construction movement rapidly formed.

Chengguan Town has a total of 3,313 households and 11,528 citizens and farmers, with four streets, three agricultural cooperatives, and four production cooperatives for poor citizens and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The cultural leap forward was first ignited by the fire of eliminating the four pests. While launching a large-scale hygiene campaign to attack the remnants of the four pests, the learning enthusiasm of the broad masses also generally increased. Four private middle schools were established in the town, with 213 students, and six private primary school classes were established, with 376 students, accounting for 99.9% of the 592 school-age youth and children. Six mass-run spare-time middle schools were opened, with 213 students, and 28 spare-time primary school classes were opened, with 1,494 students, accounting for 92.8% of the original 1,653 literacy target population. Fourteen kindergartens and thirteen nurseries were established. Seven cadre spare-time red and expert universities were opened, with 204 participants. The whole town achieved the goal of every street having a middle school, every cooperative having a primary school, every district (residential area) and team having a spare-time primary school, and the sound of reading could be heard everywhere.

Because the broad masses have mastered the tools of literacy, in the vigorous propaganda movement and the leap forward climax of education and health work, a large number of poems and clapper rhymes have been compiled to publicize the Party's policies and praise their own efforts and ideals, various folk art activities and sports activities have been organized, and various talents have emerged. But the masses still feel that cultural life is insufficient, and put forward higher ideals and requirements such as "Learn culture today, become a writer tomorrow." The town party committee immediately guided the masses to march toward science and culture, enrich nurseries and kindergartens, establish clubs, libraries, and broadcasting, install loudspeakers, rectify amateur opera troupes, and establish writing groups, adopting various forms of activities, and artistic talents displayed their genius, and a cultural wind swept across the town. In order to further mobilize all positive factors, vigorously publicize and implement the General Line, and carry out technical revolution and cultural revolution, the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee proposed to carry out Twelve-Family Activities. According to the demands of the masses and the various forms of activities and talents created by the masses themselves, the town party committee organized and developed 34 mass writers (who can compose songs, write poems, compile jingles, clapper rhymes, short plays, write manuscripts, etc.), 16 inventors (who have inventions, creations, and improvements to production tools, daily necessities, and various equipment), 18 scientists (who have specialized theoretical and practical knowledge of the production technology of various crops), 19 men of letters (who can write, create, love literature and have literary works), 18 academics (who are proficient in health and medical skills or other academics), 31 singers (who understand general music theory, can sing, have good voices, are good at singing and like singing, and play a backbone role in singing), 31 musicians (who understand music theory, can play and play, specialize in a music theory, and have a technical level higher than average), 67 playwrights (who have performance skills, higher than average), 14 painters (who can paint Chinese paintings, cartoons, have painting skills, and have made achievements), 19 athletes (who understand sports rules and have specialized skills), 24 folk storytellers (who specialize in a folk storytelling art, such as drum storytelling, zhui zi, etc.), 27 folk dancers (such as lion dance, land boats, who have a specialized dance technique). A total of 318 cultural artists of various kinds, accounting for 3% of the total population, formed the activity team of twelve families. Six literary creation groups, six cultural relic preservation groups, thirty literary groups, thirty singing groups, four hundred reading groups, six gymnasiums, one agricultural technology research association, six technical research groups, and four amateur opera troupes were established, so that every cooperative has a club, library, opera troupe, gymnasium, literary creation group, cultural relic preservation group, and every team has a literary group, storytelling group, singing group, reading group. The propaganda team has expanded from 2,044 people to 3,544 people, accounting for 30.7% of the total population. The whole town has emerged with singing, reading, and entertaining sounds of pulling and singing, and the cultural atmosphere is generally high.

The Twelve Families Show Their Talents
Political Propaganda as Vanguard

After the formation of the Twelve-Family Activities, they were followed by a series of production tasks such as summer harvesting and planting, publicizing and implementing the General Line, fighting drought and sowing seeds, protecting seedlings, managing autumn fields, and vigorously supporting the rural areas by handicrafts. In the movement of the overall leap forward with the propaganda of the General Line as the key link, the twelve families showed their great skills. "Everyone comes up with ideas, everyone contributes their skills, sings the General Line, and propagandizes as the vanguard" is the common slogan of the twelve families. The writers of Minquan Street and Beixin Street, under the leadership of the branch, published the Dongfeng Bao and Yuejin Bao in succession. Once the broad masses have mastered cultural knowledge, their thinking has been liberated, and they are singing the happy mood in labor anytime and anywhere, compiling a large number of songs and poems, turning the enthusiasm of the masses into heroic poems and clapper rhymes. In the joy of harvesting wheat, the masses used poems to praise the Communist Party and celebrate the bumper harvest:

Chairman Mao is like our parents, leading the masses in the right direction;
This year's wheat harvest is a bumper harvest, and men and women, young and old, are overjoyed.
The moon is curved and the wind is blowing, rushing to harvest and plant like celebrating the New Year;
The wheat grows as big as eggs, with a yield of 630 catties per mu.
The more you work, the more energetic you become, singing happily all over the streets and fields;
Celebrating the bumper harvest happily and singing the praises of the beloved Communist Party.

Su Baozhen, a singer from Minquan Street, composed a short and powerful ditty during the rush harvest: "Be determined and resolute, and finish the wheat harvest day and night to feel at ease." Hundreds and thousands of poems vigorously encouraged the masses and quickly turned into action. The town party committee's plan to harvest wheat in three days was broken through by the enthusiasm of the masses, and the harvest was basically completed in one day and night. Zong Quand, a writer from Minquan Street (secretary of the branch), found that the efficiency of the women's team of Song Junying was not high in the drought resistance, so he compiled a very combative clapper rhyme and taught the members to sing:

Enthusiasm breaks through the sky, everyone strives to be a model;
Be a good promoter and don't fall behind the line.
Protect the bumper harvest without rain, and protect the increased production in a flood;
Live and eat at the construction site, and treat the night as the day.
One day is worth three autumns, and one hour is worth one year;
Seize the time to work hard to ensure a bumper harvest.

Encouraged by the singing of this soaring enthusiasm, Captain Song Junying organized the women of the whole team to carry out a debate on saving time with more, faster, better and more economical methods. Carrying water by two people was changed to carrying water by one person, which greatly improved the efficiency of sowing. All 28 women in the team, except for those who were too old or had children, all 19 of them lived and ate at the construction site, ensuring that the sowing task was completed on time.

After issuing the call to deeply publicize the General Line, the twelve families gave full play to their creative talents, eight immortals crossed the sea, each showing their magical powers, compiling scripts such as "Singing a New Chengguan", "Changes in Haijiagang", "Li Louji", and songs such as "East Wind Overwhelms West Wind", "Singing the General Line", teaching them to the masses to sing, and there are a large number of poems, clapper rhymes, song lyrics and so on.

Encouraged by the General Line, the creators are becoming more and more enthusiastic, the writers are the masses, reflecting the labor life of the masses anytime and anywhere, and wonderful articles are appearing everywhere. In more than a month, a total of 11 scripts have been created, five of which have been staged, and more than 3,100 poems, clapper rhymes, and lyrics have been written, and 17 songs have been written. Li Xiurong of Shengli Street was originally illiterate. In the forty days since literacy, she has compiled more than 30 jingles, writing whenever she has time. Poetry has penetrated into her daily life. For mowing grass in the field, after eating, she didn't wash the dishes, so she wrote a poem and put it on the stove: "My daughter is not at home, my mother washes the pot, my mother pays attention to hygiene, and can live to be 108 years old." The upsurge of creation is constantly developing.

Encouraged by the General Line, the inventors have all gathered their energy and strived to go upstream, their thinking has been greatly liberated, and they have made bold innovations, creations and improvements to production tools and daily necessities. Wang Jinde of the Iron Industry Production Cooperative trial-produced a wheat harvester, which does not cost much and can harvest 20 mu every day, improving efficiency by 10 times. Liu Changrong of the Wood Industry Cooperative invented a wooden water pump. Wang Hongchang of the Agricultural Cooperative created a weeding and fertilizing machine. Luo Tingfu created a cotton soil cultivator, which has been widely used. Around "July 1", a mass upsurge of inventing and creating tool reforms to pay tribute to "July 1" was set off. At present, 113 kinds of tools have been created.

The scientists are focusing on the current research on the cultivation and management techniques of crops such as cotton, sweet potatoes, and rice. All three agricultural cooperatives in the town have cotton professional teams, and each team has technicians, who are both technicians and scientists. This spring, the 700 mu of cotton in the Heping Agricultural Cooperative suffered frost, and there was a phenomenon of drying up. Sixteen scientists conducted multiple studies and decided to apply chemical fertilizer on one side and cotton oil soap on the other. After four or five days, the cotton seedlings improved. Now the seedlings are deep and the plants are strong, with no grass or insects, which has strengthened their confidence in striving for a high yield of 20,000 catties per mu in the fertile fields and 1,000 catties per mu in general fields. They are full of energy and are striving to achieve this goal. On June 13, Li Xiurong of Shengli Street discovered that more than a dozen rabbits in the cooperative died in one day, so she studied technical books and found that it was hot and lacking water. She immediately used alum and cowpea water to feed the rabbits, and none of them have died in the past 20 days.

Medical academics are also studying ways to eliminate and prevent several diseases. Wang Hengzhang and other two people, after studying, designed an eight-free automated toilet, which has been tested well and does not cost money. It has been widely promoted throughout the town, further improving toilet hygiene.

The singers' slogan of action is: spread the singing throughout the town. Grasp the singing groups of each production team as the backbone force, and teach the socialist songs to all the masses. On the basis of already reaching a point where some of the masses have learned 10 to 12 songs, most have learned 5 to 6 songs, and a few have learned 2 to 3 songs, they are now creating and teaching singing according to the spirit of the General Line and combined with real people and real events.

The painters, after three days and nights of hard work, have transformed all the slogans in the town into cartoons. Ni Xiangting and others of Heping Street drew rockets, trains, ducks, etc. in the summer harvest, and the cartoon-style appraisal table effectively promoted the summer harvest. Shengli Street drew a comic strip of the changes in Haijiagang to expand publicity. They are now marching towards beautifying the city and beautifying the courtyards. With the assistance of relevant forces, 2,740 entrances of the 3,313 households have been beautified. The athletes organized four basketball teams as the core and cooperated with the club to carry out sports activities indoors and outdoors. Playwrights, on the one hand, rehearsed excellent repertoires such as "The General Line is Exciting" and "Liu Jie Mei", and on the other hand, developed towards self-writing, self-singing and self-entertainment, creating scripts, and have already rehearsed "New Fangcheng", "Chengguan in Leap Forward",
 "Changes in Haijiagang" and other five repertoires. In addition to the original folk dance forms, the dancers collectively created two youth dances, which are being learned and performed, and at the same time, they are vigorously promoting them. The men of letters have also invested in creative activities, writing works that reflect the present. Storytellers, musicians, playwrights, dancers, and street propagandists organized a large propaganda team, consisting of 21 forms and 28 teams such as land boats, dances, and short plays, to publicize and implement the Party's General Line to every corner of Chengguan.

Everyone's hearts are blooming, everyone's faces are smiling
Songs are rising everywhere, dances are coming everywhere

The twelve families cooperated with each other, playing a backbone role in publicizing the General Line, technological revolution and cultural revolution, striving for a bumper harvest, making the streets and alleys lively, and promoting the leap forward in various tasks.

1. The propagandists and the twelve families cooperated with each other, making the propaganda activities rich and colorful, encouraging people's hearts anytime and anywhere, and the propaganda was more extensive and in-depth. Therefore, men and women, young and old, in the town quickly mastered the spirit of the General Line, directly promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and ensuring a great wheat harvest, with a yield of 250 to 630 catties per mu. Encouraged by the General Line, all citizens launched a movement of accumulating and contributing fertilizer, contributing a total of 410 carts of fertilizer in half a month, which strongly supported agricultural production.

2. It has greatly liberated people's thinking, promoted technological revolution and cultural revolution, changed people's mental outlook, and consolidated and improved the results of literacy.

First of all, driven by the inventors and scientists, the spirit of daring to speak and daring to do has greatly increased. Originally, more than 30 kinds of tools were created and modified. After the technical reform exhibition, the superstitious beliefs were broken with vivid facts, and a wave of creating, inventing and reforming tools to pay tribute to "July 1" was set off. Various creations reached 113 kinds. After Liu Changrong and Zhang Fulu of Beixin Street created four tools: a winnowing machine, a corn seeder, a water pump, and a deep-plowing step plow, they sang their own poem "The corn seeder plows the ground instead of hoeing, saving one person, and the seedlings come out evenly", and then studied two new tools.

Secondly, it has boosted morale, established new living habits, and greatly changed the environment and family hygiene. On the basis of the original twelveizations, the toilet has basically achieved eight-free automation, the walls are all mud-plastered, the street slogans are beautified, the indoor and courtyard walls are artistically sloganned, weeds are eradicated, indoor ventilation is improved, dung pits are frequently padded and covered, every household has a water channel seepage pool, food is covered, every cooperative has a maternity hospital, every courtyard has a garden, and the elimination of large dung fields and dung piles in the fields has been realized. The sanitation of the whole town has entered a new stage, developing towards the direction of completely changing hygiene habits, changing the environment, beautifying Chengguan, and preventing and eliminating diseases.

New cultural life is gradually forming an indispensable part of people's daily life, and more and more people are joining the cultural team. The team of twelve families is expanding from 318 people to 629 people, and the propaganda team is expanding to 4,355 people. More than 100 old ladies over the age of 40 and 50 have participated in twisting the yangko and publicizing the General Line. Women who did not participate in social activities in the past are also practicing to participate in street dance. Gao Yufang, an old lady from Shengli Street (who used to be very feudal), happily twisted the yangko while cooking. Geng Benqing, an old lady in her 60s from Minquan Street, still twisted the yangko with her children before going to bed at night. Under this influence, the cadres of the organs formed a propaganda team of 312 people, disguised themselves to carry out propaganda. Sun Peiru, a doctor from the Health Institute, did not participate in political activities in the past, but now he also dresses up and goes to the streets. More and more young and middle-aged women on the streets are participating in political activities. These situations show that people's old ideology is rapidly collapsing. The reason why they participate in activities so happily is that after ideological liberation, they deeply realize the happiness under the socialist system, and they cannot suppress their happy mood. As Dong Shiping of Shengli Street said: "In the old society, life was not good when I was young, and I couldn't be happy even if I wanted to. In the new society, who would be happy if I wasn't?" Xu Dezhi, the family member of a martyr, said: "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to turn over, who would go to the streets to twist? I didn't expect to go through my youth again." At the same time, in the cultural activities, their creative enthusiasm has been greatly stimulated, not only dancing, but also asking to compose and sing themselves. Wu Xiangying, Wang Jirong and other three women from Beixin Street who had just become literate thought that the songs composed by others were not catchy, so they collectively created the yangko tune "Singing the General Line" in one night:

The General Line is like the sun, shining wherever it shines, wherever there is the General Line, the people are bright. Bright!
Gather up the courage to strive for the upstream, participate in labor is the most glorious, build socialism with more, faster, better and more economical methods, and building socialism should take the lead. Take the lead!
The overall work is a great leap forward, everyone's enthusiasm breaks through the sky, the ten-year plan is completed in one year, and a bumper harvest is guaranteed every year. Bumper harvest!
Always follow the Communist Party, keep Chairman Mao's words in mind, build the motherland with diligence and frugality, and socialism is infinitely happy. Infinitely happy!

In short, the lively situation of "everyone's hearts are blooming, everyone's faces are smiling, songs are rising everywhere, and dances are coming everywhere" has already appeared and is developing.

3. People's communist style is being established. When the masses realized the superiority of the socialist system, the enthusiasm for doing socialist cause soared rapidly. Overcoming departmentalism, a socialist great cooperation was carried out. When the Heping Cooperative was short of labor, Xiguan sent people to support it. Only 100 people were needed, and 250 members volunteered to go, ensuring the full completion of the rush harvest task. The seeds of communism are growing everywhere. Communist canteens have been established in every team of the agricultural cooperative, and they sing the song: "The canteen is really good, it saves food and fills us up, it saves time to work, it strives for a bumper harvest, we will do our best for a long time, and everything will be realized." Canteens have also been established in the civil production cooperatives one after another. With the improvement of the masses' awareness and urgent demands, kindergartens and nurseries have been greatly consolidated, the five-guarantee households have moved into the Happy Courtyard of Production with the desire to "spend their old age happily", and the maternity hospitals of each cooperative have been established one after another. Now, the face of the whole town is undergoing new and profound changes.

Combining Popularization and Improvement
Marching Towards an Advanced Cultural Town

After the widely carried out cultural leap forward centered on the Twelve-Family Activities in Chengguan Town, it is developing in a new direction. With the development of the activities, more people are actively participating in creation, singing, and dancing, and at the same time, the masses have raised the issue of improving quality. Wang Baozhu, a painter from Minquan Street, painted poorly, and the masses gave their opinions. He produced during the day and practiced hard for three nights, catching up with the general level, and the masses asked him to paint. In order to meet the needs of the masses, popularize and improve cultural life, and promote technological revolution and cultural revolution, the town party committee has now put forward the slogan of "Marching towards an advanced cultural town" and is looking for new forms of activities and working methods. Starting from the guiding ideology of combining popularization and improvement, it is making efforts in the following aspects.

1. Improve the political consciousness of Party members, League members, cadres and all the people. Four Marxist-Leninist colleges have been established in the town, absorbing 112 people, including all Party members and main cadres of streets and cooperatives, to participate in learning. Various red and expert universities and specialized schools have uniformly set up political courses. The town party committee prepares lessons uniformly, lectures in sections, and systematically implements the Party's policies and policies. Students of the Marxist-Leninist College serve as political counselors in various schools, carrying out mass activities of studying theory and Party policies to improve the political quality of each family.

2. Nine comprehensive red and expert universities, health, drama and music, dance specialized schools, and normal specialized schools have been established to train backbones in order to absorb more people to participate in activities. Outstanding people from the twelve families are selected to serve as lecturers, and the rest are used as backbone students. The method of unified study of politics, separate classes for culture, seasonal study of technology, and the site as a classroom is adopted for learning. Judging from the current activities, the effect is relatively good. Shi Jinshan (scientist), a lecturer in the crop cultivation department of the Heping Street Comprehensive University, found that there was peeling in the cotton field when pruning and topping, so he organized a technical class on the ground, talked about the methods of pruning and topping and the harm of peeling to cotton seedlings, and criticized the erroneous idea of being afraid of trouble and not paying attention to quality. The students further mastered the technology. Chen Hongyi and Zhou Guozhen (dancers), students of the Shengli Street Sports, Music, Dance, and Art Specialized School, studied new dance art at the school, and then went back to organize more than a dozen women and old ladies who actively asked to participate in dance to learn. With the development of this activity, both popularization and improvement have received preliminary results.

3. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the twelve families and give full play to the enthusiasm of all kinds of skilled people, research work has been carried out. The town has established organizations such as the Writers Association, the Science Popularization Association, the Music and Dance Association, the Sports Association, the Fine Arts Association, and the Drama Association to carry out research, study, and exchange experience in an organized and planned manner. Now, various associations are working together to carry out a large-scale book creation activity, and nearly 50 to 60 books have been completed.

Leadership Methods of the Town Party Committee

1. The leaders personally take charge, the whole party is mobilized, all the people are mobilized, grasp the political and ideological work, create momentum, and set off a climax. The town party committee has a special person in charge, and the committee members divide their work and take charge of the comprehensive work while grasping the cultural work, often going deep into the masses, specifically checking, the leaders take the lead, actively influencing, the party members and league members of the town have a unified understanding, take the lead in the movement, form a core force, organize a propaganda army, everyone speaks, everyone talks, so that the plan becomes the action of the masses, the old are eighty and the young are five years old, regardless of men, women, old and young, citizens, farmers, workers, cadres, and students all start working together, and no one is idle. This forms a cultural leap forward army that has both leadership and gives full play to the enthusiasm of the masses.

2. Combine production and serve production. The leap forward in production has promoted the leap forward in culture, and the leap forward in culture has actively served and promoted the upsurge of production. Production and construction are the foundation of cultural construction. This is an unshakable guiding ideology. The strength is properly arranged, and all kinds of skilled people are mobilized to serve production, so that science, literary and artistic creation, and invention are all implemented in production. The cultural climax has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and promoted production. Facts have proved that the two are not contradictory, but promote each other.

3. Break through at one point, blossom in all directions, one link brings another, summarize step by step, raise questions, and arrange new tasks. The cultural construction climax in Chengguan Town first started with sanitation. When the masses saw the achievements of the sanitation work, they immediately grasped the education work and set off a climax of national learning. When education and sanitation leap forward, culture appeared to be lagging behind, and the masses were organized to immediately march toward science and culture. The three giant flows merged together, grasping the twelve family activities to create a new situation, and then put forward the slogan of "Marching towards an advanced cultural town" and developed in the direction of popularization and improvement. In this way, the front wave passed and the rear wave caught up, thus maintaining full energy and preventing slack and complacency, and the situation of leap forward in everything and overall leap forward appeared.

4. Grasp the advanced, grasp the typical, visit and compare, grasp the surface and buckle the points, and maintain balance. This is a new leadership method created under the situation of the great leap forward. This method was used in the development of the Farmer Twelve-Family Activities. First, do a good job in various tasks, organize visits and studies, unify ideological understanding through rectification spirit, and carry out comprehensive actions, unified inspection and evaluation. The sanitation work was first launched from Haijiagang. This place is mostly poor Hui people who slaughter cattle and sheep, and the living environment and terrain are not good, but it has leaped to become the banner of the whole town. After organizing street cadres, mass groups, organ cadres, and school teachers and students to visit, many units debated on the spot, criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas and the condition theory, and quickly set off an overall climax. After the formation of the climax, timely evaluation and summary were carried out, and each family regularly rotates to evaluate and exchange experience to vigorously promote the progress of the movement. At the same time, pay attention to discovering dead corners, organize forces, concentrate on doing it, and reverse the situation in time to strive for balance.

    方城县城关镇在3月23日实现了无文盲镇。在扫除文盲之后，立即提出了“点起跃进火，烧掉文化盲，苦干半个月，五一实现文化镇”的奋斗目标。这一号召，马上变为群众的行动，群众唱起了“哗啦啦，哗啦啦，讲卫生，学文化，俱乐部里玩一下；天不怕，地不怕，拿着笔杆能说话，前天会识字，今天会作文，明天就要当作家；要实现文化镇，先要实现文化家，看谁跑在前，红旗谁来拿”等顺口溜。在这些行动口号的鼓舞下，迅速形成了全民性的文化建设运动。
    城关镇全镇市民、农民共三千三百一十三户、一万一千五百二十八人，有四条街三个农业社，四个贫苦市民和烈军属生产社。文化跃进是先由消灭四害之火烧起来的。在向四害残余进军大搞卫生的同时，广大群众学习热情也普遍高涨。全镇建立了民办中学四所，学生二百一十三人，民办小学六班，学生三百七十六人，共占应入学青少年和儿童五百九十二人的99.9％。开办群众业余中学六所，学生二百一十三人，业余小学二十八班，一千四百九十四人，占原扫盲对象一千六百五十三人的92.8％。成立幼儿园十四所，托儿所十三处。开办了干部业余红专大学七所，参加学习的二百零四人。全镇达到街街有中学，社社有小学，区区（居民区）、队队有业余小学，读书之声，到处都有。

    十二家各显神通
    政治宣传当尖兵
    十二家活动形成后，紧接着就是夏收夏种、宣传贯彻总路线、抗旱播种、保苗、秋田管理、手工业大力支援农村等一系列的生产任务。在以宣传总路线为纲的全面大跃进的运动中，十二家们大显身手。“个个出主意，人人献本领，歌唱总路线，宣传当尖兵”，是十二家的共同口号。民权街、北新街的作家们，在支部领导下，办的东风报和跃进报相继出版。广大群众一旦掌握了文化知识，思想得到了解放，随时随地在歌唱劳动中的愉快心情，编写了大量的歌曲和诗歌，把群众的干劲变为豪壮的诗歌和快板。在收麦的欢乐中，群众用诗歌来歌颂共产党，欢唱大丰收：

    今年麦子大丰收，男女老少喜洋洋。
    月儿弯弯风扑面，抢收抢种似过年；
    麦子长的鸡蛋大，一亩单产六百三。
    干活越干越有劲，满街遍野齐欢唱；
    欢天喜地庆丰收，歌颂亲爱的共产党。
    民权街歌唱家苏保珍，在抢收中编了短小有力的小歌子：“立志气，下决心，一天一夜完成小麦收割才放心。”成百上千的诗歌，有力地鼓舞着群众，迅速变成了行动。镇委三天收完麦的计划，被群众的干劲冲破，一昼夜基本收割完。民权街作家宗全德（支书），发觉抗旱中妇女宋俊英队效率不高，就编写了战斗性很强的快板，教给社员来说唱：
    干劲冲破天，个个争模范；
    当好促进派，不落阵后边。
    无雨保丰收，涝天保增产；
    食宿在工地，夜晚当白天。
    一日当三秋，一时当一年；
    抓紧时间干，才能保丰产。
    在这种冲天干劲的歌声鼓舞下，队长宋俊英组织全队妇女开展了多快好省争时间的辩论，由两人抬水变成了单人挑，大大提高了播种效率。全队二十八个妇女，除年纪过大和有小孩的以外，其余十九人全部食宿在工地，保证了播种任务按时完成。
    在发出深入宣传总路线的号召后，十二家更充分发挥了创作天才，八仙过海，各显神通，编写了“歌唱新城关”、“海家岗的变化”、“李楼记”等剧本，和“东风压倒西风”、“歌唱总路线”等歌子，教给群众唱，还有大量的诗歌、快板。
    在总路线的鼓舞下，创作家们干劲越来越足，作家是群众，随时随地反映着群众的劳动生活，精彩的文章到处出现。一个多月来，共创作了剧本十一本，已排演了五本，诗歌、快板、唱词等三千一百余篇，歌曲十七首。胜利街李秀荣，原来是文盲，扫盲以后的四十多天来，编写顺口溜三十多篇，有空就写，诗歌已渗透到她的日常生活中，为下地割草，吃罢饭没洗碗，就写了一首诗放在锅台上，“女儿不在家，妈妈把锅刷，妈妈讲卫生，能活一百八”。创作的热潮正在不断地发展。
    发明家们，在总路线的鼓舞下，个个鼓足干劲，力争上游，思想大大解放，对生产工具和生活用品都作了大胆的革新创造和改进。铁业生产社王金德试制了小麦收割机，成本不高，每天能收割二十亩，提高效率十倍。木业社刘长荣发明了木制抽水机。农业社王宏昌创造了锄草施肥两用机。罗廷甫创制了棉花培土器，已经广泛使用。在“七一”前后掀起了向“七一”献礼的群众性的发明创造工具改革的热潮。目前已创制各种工具一百一十三种。
    科学家们，抓住当前对棉花、红薯、水稻等作物为主的栽培管理技术研究。全镇三个农业社，社社有棉花专业队，队队都有技术员，既是技术员又是科学家。和平农业社七百亩棉花，今春棉苗受霜冻，出现了干枯现象，十六个科学家进行多次研究，决定一面追化肥，一面打棉油皂，四、五天后棉苗好转，现在苗深棵旺，无草无虫，坚定了争取高额丰产的信心，干劲十足，正在为实现丰产田亩产两万斤，一般地亩产一千斤而奋斗。胜利街李秀荣6月13日发现社里家兔一天死了十几只，就钻研技术书籍，发现天热缺水，即用白矾、菜豆水给兔子喝，二十多天来没有死一个。
    医学学术家也正在研究消灭、预防几种疾病的方法。王衡章等二人，经过钻研，设计了八无自动化厕所，经试验良好，又不费钱，已在全镇普遍推广，进一步改善了厕所卫生。
    歌唱家的行动口号是：把歌声传遍全镇。抓住各生产队的歌唱组为骨干力量，向全体群众教唱社会主义歌曲。在已经达到一部分群众学会十至十二首，大部分学会五至六首，少部分学会二至三首歌的基础上，现在正根据总路线的精神，结合真人真事进行创作和教唱。
    画家经过苦战三昼夜，全镇已经标语漫画化。和平街倪相亭等在夏收中画了火箭、火车、鸭子等，以漫画形式的评比表，有力地推动了夏收。胜利街画了海家岗的变化连环画，扩大宣传。现在正在向美化城市、美化院落进军，三千三百一十三户，在有关力量的协助下，已完成了二千七百四十个门口的美化工作。体育家组织了四个篮球队为核心，配合俱乐部在室内外开展体育活动。戏剧家，一方面排演了“总路线激动人心”、“刘介梅”等优秀的剧目，一方面往自编自唱自乐方面发展，创作了剧本，并且已排了“新方城”、“跃进中的城关”、
  “海家岗的变化”等五个剧目。舞蹈家除原有的民间舞蹈形式外，又集体创作了青年舞两个，正在学习和表演，同时正在大力进行普及。文学家也投入了创作活动，编写反映现时的作品。说唱家、音乐家、戏剧家、舞蹈家和街道宣传员，组织了一支声势浩大的宣传队伍，组成旱船、舞蹈、小剧等二十一种形式、二十八个队，向城关的各个角落宣传贯彻党的总路线。
    人人心花放　个个笑颜开
    歌声四处起　舞蹈遍地来
    十二家相互配合，在宣传总路线、技术革命和文化革命、争取大丰收中起了骨干作用，闹得大街小巷热火朝天，促使各项工作跃进。
    一、宣传员和十二家互相配合，使宣传活动丰富多彩，随时随地鼓舞着人心，宣传更加广泛深入，因而全镇男女老少很快地掌握了总路线的精神，直接促进了工农业生产的大跃进，保证了小麦大丰收，亩产二百五十到六百三十斤。全体市民在总路线的鼓舞下，开展了积肥、献肥运动，半月来共献肥四百一十车，有力地支援了农业生产。
    二、大大解放了人们的思想，促进了技术革命和文化革命，改变了人们的精神面貌，巩固和提高了扫盲成果。
    首先在创造发明家和科学家的带动下，敢说敢做的思想大大高涨，原来创制和改制各种工具三十多种，经过技术改革展览以后，以生动事实打破了迷信，掀起了向“七一”献礼的创造发明改革工具的热潮，各种创造达一百一十三种。北新街刘长荣、张付禄创造了扬场机、玉米点播机、抽水机、深翻步犁四种工具以后，唱着自己编的“玉米点播器，随犁代耩地，节省一个人，苗又出的齐”的诗歌，又钻研两种新工具。
    其次，振奋了精神，树立了新的生活习惯，环境和家庭卫生大改观。在原来十二化的基础上，又基本实现了厕所八无自动化，墙壁全部泥搪化，街道标语美术化，室院墙壁标语艺术化，杂草铲除化，室内改良通风化，粪坑勤垫加盖化，户户水道渗池化，食物笼罩化，社社产院化，院院花园化，消灭大粪场和田间粪堆化，全镇卫生面貌进入了新的阶段，向彻底改变卫生习惯，改变环境，美化城关，预防、消灭疾病的方向发展。
    新的文化生活正在逐渐形成为人们日常生活中不可缺少的部分，越来越多的人参加到文化队伍里来，十二家的队伍正在扩大，由三百一十八人发展到六百二十九人，宣传队伍扩大到四千三百五十五人。有一百多个四、五十岁以上的老太太参加了扭秧歌和总路线宣传，过去不参加社会活动的妇女，也在练习参加街头舞蹈。胜利街高玉芳老太太（过去很封建）做着饭高兴得还扭秧歌，民权街六十多岁的老太太耿本清晚上临睡时还和小孩一起扭秧歌。在这种影响下，机关干部组成了三百一十二人的宣传队伍，化装开展宣传，卫生院医生孙佩儒过去不参加政治活动，现在也化装上街。街道青壮年妇女越来越多地参加政治活动。这些情况说明人们旧的思想意识正在迅速地土崩瓦解。他们所以这样高兴地参加活动，是在思想解放以后，深刻体会到在社会主义制度下的幸福，他们压抑不住愉快的心情。正如胜利街董士平说：“旧社会年轻时日子不好过，想高兴也不得高兴，新社会我不高兴谁高兴？”烈属徐德芝说：“要不是毛主席领导我们翻了身，谁会得上街扭扭？想不到又从青年时过一过。”同时，在文化活动中，大大激发了他们的创作热情，不但舞蹈，而且要求自编自歌唱。北新街吴相英、王季荣等刚脱盲的三个妇女，嫌别人编的唱着不顺口，一晚上集体创作了秧歌调“歌唱总路线”：
    总路线像太阳，照到哪儿哪儿亮，哪儿有了总路线，哪儿人民亮堂堂。亮堂堂！
    鼓足干劲争上游，参加劳动最光荣，多快好省搞建设，建设社会理当先。理当先！
    全面工作大跃进，人人干劲冲破天，十年计划一年完，保证年年大丰产。大丰产！
    永远跟着共产党，毛主席的话儿记心间，勤俭节约建祖国，社会主义乐无边。乐无边！
    总之，现在“人人心花放，个个笑颜开，歌声四处起，舞蹈遍地来”的生动活泼的局面已经出现和正在发展。
    三、人们的共产主义风格正在树立。当群众体会到社会主义制度的优越性后，大搞社会主义事业的劲头迅速高涨。克服了本位主义，开展了社会主义大协作。和平社劳动力不足，西关即派人支援，只需要一百人，社员自报去了二百五十人，保证了抢收任务的全面完成。共产主义的萌芽到处生长。农业社队队都建立了共产主义食堂，他们唱着：“食堂真正好，既省粮食又吃饱，干活省时间，争取大丰产，大干一老晌，全部要实现”的歌子。市民生产社也随着相继建立了食堂。在群众的觉悟提高和迫切要求下，幼儿园、托儿所大大巩固，五保户抱着“欢欢乐乐度过晚年”的愿望，搬进了生产幸福院，各社的妇产院相继建立。现在，全镇面貌正在发生着新的深刻的变化。
    普及和提高相结合
    向高级文化镇迈进
    城关镇以十二家活动为中心内容的文化大跃进广泛开展起来以后，正在往新的方向发展。随着活动的开展，更多的人积极参加了创作、歌唱、舞蹈，同时群众提出了提高质量的问题。民权街画家王保珠画的比较差，群众提意见，他白天生产，晚上苦练三夜，赶上了一般水平，群众都请他画了。为了适应群众的要求，普及和提高文化生活，促进技术革命和文化革命，现在，镇委已提出“向高级文化镇进军”的口号，寻找着新的活动形式和工作方法。从普及和提高相结合的指导思想出发，正在从以下几方面努力。
    一、提高党、团员、干部和全民的政治觉悟。全镇建立马克思列宁主义学院四所，吸收全体党员、街、社主要干部一百一十二人参加学习，各种红专大学和专科学校统一设政治课。镇委统一备课，分片讲授，系统地贯彻党的方针政策。马克思列宁主义学院学员担任各学校的政治辅导员，开展群众性的学习理论、党的政策的活动，提高各家的政治质量。
    二、建立了综合红专大学、卫生、戏剧音乐、舞蹈专科学校、师范专科学校共九所，培养骨干，以便吸收更多的人参加活动。从十二家能手中挑选优秀的担任讲师，其余作为骨干学员。采取统一学政治，分班学文化，按季学技术，现场当课堂的方法进行学习。从目前活动情况看，效果比较良好。和平街综合大学作物栽培系讲师石金山（科学家），发现棉田整枝打杈有脱皮现象，随即组织了地头技术课，讲了整枝打杈的方法和脱皮对棉苗的危害，批判了怕麻烦不注意质量的错误思想，学员进一步掌握了技术。胜利街体、音、舞、美专科学校学员陈红义、周国珍（舞蹈家）在学校研究和学习了新的舞蹈艺术，随即回去组织积极要求参加舞蹈的十几个妇女和老太太进行学习。随着这一活动的开展，普及和提高都收到了初步的效果。
    三、为了加强党对十二家的领导和充分发挥各家能手的积极性，开展了研究工作。全镇建立了作家协会、科普协会、音舞协会、体育协会、美术协会、戏剧协会等组织，有组织有计划地开展研究学习和交流经验。现在，各个协会共同协作，正开展着规模宏大的百本书创作活动，将近完成的已有五、六十本。
      镇委的领导方法
    一、领导亲自挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，抓政治思想工作，造声势，掀高潮。镇委有专人负责，委员分工分片，抓起全面工作的同时抓起文化工作，经常深入群众，具体检查，领导带头，积极影响，全镇党团员统一认识，在运动中，一马当先，形成核心力量，组织宣传大军，人人说，个个讲，使规划变为群众的行动，老者八十小者五岁，不管男女老少，市民、农民、工人、干部、学生一齐动手，人人不闲。这就形成了一支既有领导又充分发挥群众积极性的文化跃进大军。
    二、结合生产，服务生产。生产的跃进推动了文化的跃进，文化的跃进又积极地服务和推动着生产高潮，生产建设是文化建设的基础，这是不可动摇的指导思想。力量妥善安排，调动各家能手为生产服务，使科学、文艺创作、创造发明等都贯彻到生产中去。文化高潮大大鼓起了群众的干劲，促进了生产。事实证明，两者并不矛盾，而是互相推动。
    三、一点突破，全面开花，一环带一环，步步总结，提出问题，安排新任务。城关镇的文化建设高潮，先在卫生上开始，当群众看到卫生工作的成绩时，就及时抓着教育工作，掀起全民学习的高潮，当教育、卫生跃进起来的时候，就显得文化落后了，组织群众立即向科学、文化进军，三股巨流汇合一起，抓着十二家活动造成新的局面，并随即提出“向高级文化镇进军”的口号，向普及和提高的方向发展。这样前浪过去后浪追上，从而保持干劲十足，防止了松劲和自满情绪，出现了事事跃进，全面跃进的形势。
    四、抓先进，抓典型，参观评比，抓着面扣着点，掌握平衡。这是在大跃进形势下创造出来的新的领导方法。在开展农民十二家的活动中运用了这一方法，各项工作先搞出样子，组织参观学习，以整风精神鸣放辩论，统一思想认识，全面行动，统一检查评比。卫生工作就是首先从海家岗掀起的。这个地方多是杀牛宰羊的贫苦回民，居住环境、地势都不好，但一跃而成为全镇的旗帜，组织街道干部群众、机关干部、学校师生进行参观后，不少单位就地辩论，批判右倾保守思想和条件论，迅速掀起了全面高潮。在高潮形成以后，及时进行评比总结，并且经常坚持各家定期轮流评比，交流经验，有力地推动了运动的进展。同时，注意发现死角，组织力量，集中去搞，及时扭转局面，争取平衡。
