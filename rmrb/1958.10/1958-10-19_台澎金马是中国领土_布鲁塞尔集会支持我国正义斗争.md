Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 16th: A conference supporting the struggle of the Chinese people was held in Brussels on the 13th.

The meeting was chaired by Émile Cavénaille, a member of the Executive Committee of the Belgian League for the Defense of Peace. Jules Chome, a lawyer of the High Court, gave a report at the meeting. Based on irrefutable documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, he proved that Jinmen, Matsu, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands are an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

Ahmed, Vice President of the Belgium-China Association, enthusiastically introduced the leap-forward development of the Chinese people's peaceful construction. He advocated that the Belgian government recognize China and denounced the absurd and unrealistic attitude of those who insisted on ignoring the 600 million Chinese people.
