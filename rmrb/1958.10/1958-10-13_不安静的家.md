    The Uneasy Home
    Rural Department of the CPC Foshan Prefectural Committee of Guangdong, Liu Jiong
    On the night of celebrating the establishment of the People's Commune, my dad shook me awake in the middle of the night: "Dachun, you have to assign me a job today."
    I was really stunned when I heard it: "He's over eighty years old, an old man who hung up his plow twenty years ago, he should go to the House of Happiness."
    "You bastard, you're just bullying me! Is Huang Zhong younger than me? If there's a place to be useful, who can't fight a hundred and eighty rounds."
    "But I, as the captain, have to be responsible."
    Dad got even angrier when he heard that: "Putting on airs with me too!" He stormed out of the door and went to the commune committee to complain about me.
    I couldn't resist him, so I had to allocate some light work for him to enjoy, but who knew that in just two days, he started a fire again: "These small, piecemeal things are not suitable, assign a big job for the transition to communism."
    When the fertilizer factory was being mechanized, he clamored to go and fiddle with it. When the water pump came, there was something else for him to clamor about, saying that he would also "eliminate the difference between workers and peasants." When everyone was making ball bearings, he also wanted to do it. ... In a word, whatever everyone was doing, he wanted to get involved. If anyone said he was too "active," he would teach them a lesson: "Silly boy, I've been rolling in the fields for forty or fifty years, and I haven't rolled out anything, and I've always been at the mercy of that damned landlord! Now, every day is different, everything is fresh, if I don't move around and learn something, I won't have anything to say when I see the King of Hell in the future."
    "Okay, Uncle Old-but-vigorous, do as you say. But if you get your fingers crushed, it's not my business." The ball bearing factory director gave him a native machine and taught him how to roll the balls, and it was only with great difficulty that he got rid of his entanglement.
    So, my home had the added music of rolling steel balls, and the interlude of my little son's loud counting: "Grandpa, another one! Thirty... thirty-five..."

    不安静的家
    中共广东佛山地委农村部　刘炯
    庆祝人民公社成立的那天晚上，爹在大半夜就摇醒了我：“大春，今朝得给我派件活计。”
    我听了着实给怔住了：“已经八十过了头，二十年前就挂了犁的老人家，该到幸福院去。”
    “混账，尽欺负老子！黄忠比我嫩吗？有用场谁不能打个一百八十回合。”
    “可是我这个队长要负责任的呀。”
    爹一听更气了：“跟老子也装腔做势！”他气鼓鼓的冲出了门，上社委会告我的状去了。
    拗不过他，只好随便拨点轻活儿让他过过瘾，谁知才不过两天，他又开火了：“这些零零碎碎的小玩艺不称手，派过渡到共产主义的大活来吧。”
    肥料厂闹机械化，他就闹着要去搬弄搬弄。抽水机来了又有他闹的事，说什么他也来“消灭工农差别”。全民闹滚珠轴承，他也要干。……一句话，大伙闹啥，他都想插手。有谁说了他一句太“活动”了，他就教训人家：“傻小子啊，我先前在地里滚了四、五十年啦，也没滚出个头，时时尽受那狗日的地主的气！如今呀，日日不同，套套新鲜，我要是不活动活动，学着点，日后见着阎王爷我可就没话说啦。”
    “好啦，老来红大叔，依你说的办。但轧着了指头可不关我的事呀。”滚珠轴承厂长发给了他土机器，教会了他轧珠子的法子，才好容易甩开了他的纠缠。
    于是，我家里多添了轧钢珠的音乐声，还有我的小儿子的高声报数的插曲：“爷爷，又一颗！三十……三十五……”
