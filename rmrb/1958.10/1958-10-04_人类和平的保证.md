    The Guarantee of Human Peace
    Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    On October 4th last year, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first man-made satellite into space, sending a happy signal to the world on its orbit. This was an epoch-making event in the history of science. It not only demonstrated the outstanding achievements of Soviet science under the superior socialist system, but also marked the beginning of a new era in science. Mankind has since taken a giant step forward, entering a new era of conquering the stars.

    Conquering the universe and traveling through space has been mankind's long-held dream. The Chinese book Liezi has an imagination of riding the wind, and there are many folk tales about the sky. Rockets were invented in China at the beginning of the 13th century. Although they were only decorations for festivals at that time, they are now the only tools available for humans to fly into outer space. The great Russian middle school teacher Tsiolkovsky studied the problem of interstellar travel and published a paper "Exploring the Universe with Jet Propulsion" in 1903. Due to his exquisite research, he had already proposed the principles and details of flying rockets, multi-stage rockets, and artificial satellites at that time. Today, the launch of artificial satellites still follows the direction he pointed out. Now it is just using new achievements in science and technology to realize Tsiolkovsky's ideal.

    Launching an artificial satellite is a highly comprehensive task, and it is the crystallization of modern scientific and technological achievements. First of all, there must be a technology that surpasses rocket jet engines so that the first-stage rocket can reach a thrust of several thousand tons in order to send the artificial satellite into its orbit. Secondly, it is necessary to master an extremely complex and precise remote control system so that the carrier rocket can proceed according to the pre-calculated orbit. In order to record the data measured at high altitude, there should be various sensitive sensing instruments and telemetry systems. Finally, a complete observation system is required on the ground to correctly collect and sort out all the scientific data detected by the artificial satellite. Therefore, to complete the above work, the joint efforts of scientists and engineers in mechanics, astronomy, physics, geophysics, radio, automation, etc. are required, and this is only possible under the superior socialist system, where people have the opportunity to give full play to their collective creative power.

    In the past year, the Soviet Union has successfully launched three artificial satellites. The payload of the satellites has become larger and larger, and the observation items have become more and more numerous. They have made great achievements in science. Through the exploration of artificial satellites, Soviet scientists have carried out scientific measurements that predecessors could not do in terms of solar radiation, cosmic rays, micrometeorites, and ionospheric structure. On the second artificial satellite, a dog was successfully transported to outer space, obtaining a series of medical and physiological data related to interstellar navigation, clarifying problems that could not be clarified under laboratory conditions or general flight conditions, thereby moving human spaceflight a step further. Judging from the Soviet Union's technical conditions, it is believed that launching artificial satellites to the moon will not be far off.

    During the International Geophysical Year, the successful launch of a series of artificial satellites by the Soviet Union made a great contribution to the cause of peace. Soviet scientists have not only made great achievements in high-altitude physics and interstellar navigation, but have also driven the progress of other sciences. Due to the operation of Soviet artificial satellites over the Earth, the interest of thousands of amateur radio and astronomers around the world has been aroused, popularizing science and making geophysical knowledge known to the broad masses of people, which will play a far-reaching role in promoting science and strengthening international cooperation. Last year, in the process of establishing twelve artificial satellite optical observation stations in our country, the Soviet Academy of Sciences provided a lot of help. In addition to donating wide-field telescopes, it also sent experts to train our amateur observers. This great selfless friendship will never be forgotten by the Chinese people.

    In these days when American imperialist war-mongers are creating tension in the Middle East and the Far East and provoking war crises, celebrating the first anniversary of the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite into space has its special significance. Artificial satellites send a call for peace to the world, and also show the world that the East wind prevails over the West wind. In the era when mankind has entered atomic energy and conquered outer space, fighting against nature is mankind's great goal. Peace is a prerequisite for completing this great task. Therefore, we need peace and must do everything possible to defend peace. However, if imperialism wants to impose war on us, we are not afraid of war either. Under the call of the Party, we will dedicate all our strength to defend peace and fight imperialism to the end. We firmly believe that the result of the struggle will inevitably end with the extinction of imperialism on a global scale. In an era of lasting peace, the people of the world will march towards nature with heroic steps and fly in outer space.

    人类和平的保证
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长  赵九章
    去年10月4日，苏联成功地把第一颗人造卫星发射上天，在它运行的轨道上，向全世界发出幸福的信号，这是科学史上一件划时代的大事。它不仅显示出在优越的社会主义制度下，苏联科学卓越的成就，同时也标志着一个科学新纪元的开始。人类从此跨了一大步，进入征服星空的新时代。
    征服宇宙，遨游太空，是人类长期以来的梦想。我国列子有御风而行的想像，民间有许多关于天空的传说。十三世纪初我国已发明了火箭，在当时虽然只是节日的点缀品，但在现在却是人类飞入宇宙空间唯一可用的工具。伟大的俄国中学教师齐奥尔科夫斯基研究了星际航行的问题，1903年发表论文“利用喷气机来探测宇宙”。由于他精湛的研究，当时他已提出了飞行火箭、多级火箭、人造卫星的原理同细节。今天人造卫星的发射，人们还是依照他所指出的方向前进的。现在不过是用了科学技术的新成就来实现齐奥尔科夫斯基的理想而已。
    发射人造卫星是一项有高度综合性的工作，它是近代科学技术成就的结晶。首先，必须有超越的火箭喷气机的技术，使第一级火箭可以达到数千吨的推进力，才能把人造卫星送上它的轨道；其次，要掌握极其复杂而精确的遥远控制系统，使运载火箭能够按照预先计算好的轨道前进；为了记载高空测量的数据，应有各种灵敏的感应仪器以及遥测系统；最后在地面上还需要一套完整的观测系统，才能正确地把人造卫星所探测到的科学资料全部收集并加以整理。因此，要完成以上工作，必须力学、天文、物理、地球物理、无线电、自动化等科学家及工程师的通力协作，而这只有在优越的社会主义制度下，人们才有充分发挥集体创造力量的可能。
    一年来，苏联成功地发射了三个人造卫星，卫星的荷载重量一个比一个大，观测项目也一个比一个多，在科学上已取得巨大的成就。通过人造卫星的探测，苏联科学家在太阳辐射、宇宙线、微流星、电离层结构等方面，进行了前人所不能做的科学测量。在第二颗人造卫星上还成功地把一只狗运送到外空间，取得一系列有关星际航行的医学生理的资料，弄清实验室条件下或一般飞行条件下所不能弄清楚的问题，从而使人类宇宙飞行又迈进一步。从苏联的技术条件来看，相信把人造卫星发射到月球，将是不远的事了。
    在国际地球物理年内，苏联一系列人造卫星发射的成功，对和平事业作出巨大的贡献。苏联科学家不仅在高空物理及星际航行方面取得伟大的成就，而且也带动着其他科学的前进。由于苏联人造卫星在地球上空的运转，引起了全世界千千万万业余无线电及天文学家的兴趣，普及了科学，使地球物理学知识为广大人民所注意，这对于推进科学加强国际合作，将起着深远的作用。去年我国在建立十二个人造卫星光学观测站的过程中，苏联科学院提供了大量的帮助，除了赠送广野望远镜外，还派专家前来训练我国业余观测人员。这种伟大无私的友情是中国人民永远不能忘怀的。
    在美帝国主义战争贩子在中东、远东制造紧张局势挑起战争危机的日子里，庆祝苏联成功发射人造卫星上天一周年是有它特殊的意义的。人造卫星向全世界发出和平的呼吁，也向全世界显示出东风压倒西风的形势。在人类已进入原子能及征服宇宙空间的时代里，向自然作斗争是人类的伟大目标。和平是完成这项伟大任务的先决条件。因此，我们需要和平，而且要尽一切力量来保卫和平。但是，如果帝国主义要把战争强加于我们头上时，我们也不怕战争。在党的号召下，为捍卫和平，我们将献出一切力量，与帝国主义斗争到底。我们深信，斗争的结果必然是以在全世界范围内帝国主义的复灭而告终。在持久和平的时代里，全世界人民，将以豪迈步伐向大自然进军，飞翔于宇宙空间。
