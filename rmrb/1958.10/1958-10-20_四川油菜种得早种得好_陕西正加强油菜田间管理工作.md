Sichuan's Rapeseed Planting is Early and Well Done
Shaanxi is Strengthening Rapeseed Field Management Work

This newspaper news (reporter Yu Jingqi reported): Sichuan Province is vigorously strengthening leadership, implementing political command and rational organization of labor, and the rapeseed sowing work is early, more, faster and better.

At present, the province's rapeseed sowing has basically ended, one to two seasons earlier than last year. According to preliminary statistics, the sowing area has expanded from more than five million mu last year to more than six million mu, and the province has basically realized the superior seed of "Victory Rapeseed." Technical measures have also been well implemented: deep plowing is generally more than one foot deep, the sowing amount is more than doubled compared with last year, the density of transplanting is about 10,000 plants, and more than 50,000 jin of base fertilizer is applied. Last year's fertilization amount was only a few thousand jin.

This year, the Party committees at all levels in Sichuan have grasped rapeseed production early and tightly. Since August, the province has formulated rapeseed production plans for next year from the special district to the county, township, and commune levels, summarized high-yield experiences, launched technical teaching and seed allocation activities.

During the sowing period, when a large number of rural laborers were supporting the steel industry, in order to solve the contradiction of many farm works and insufficient labor during the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, sowing and plowing), various places focused on grasping two points: First, comprehensively arrange and organize rural labor commando teams and professional teams, adopt a combination of division of labor and cooperation, and divide and combine tactics to separately carry out deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and management of autumn fields, and concentrate on the rush sowing of rapeseed; second, distinguish between priorities, postpone other farm work as much as possible during the rapeseed sowing period, and carry out "small movements" on a large scale. During the sowing period, Nanbu County organized a "national rapeseed sowing" campaign, with men, women, old and young all going into battle, concentrating efforts on the professional team as the center to carry out a concentrated rush, completing the sowing work that used to take more than half a month in just over five days, and all the Victory Rapeseed was planted. In addition, taking advantage of the favorable conditions of the "large" communes, various places also carried out communist large-scale cooperation. High mountains supported plains, and communes and production teams that planted less or did not plant rapeseed supported communes and teams that planted more, which greatly accelerated the sowing progress.

Many places have listed deep soil layers, fertile soil quality, and convenient irrigation and drainage as conditions for planting rapeseed. Many counties in Nanchong, Neijiang, and Wanxian special districts have ensured that all rapeseed fields are of upper and upper-middle grade. For the first time, large areas of rapeseed fields have appeared in the hilly areas of central Sichuan.

Now, farmers throughout the province are stepping up transplanting and carrying out autumn field management, determined to strive for more than doubling the rapeseed yield next year, reaching about 13 million dan to 20 million dan. Two special districts and twenty counties are determined to become thousand-jin counties, and many experimental fields are planned to yield more than 5,000 jin, and many even reach more than 10,000 jin.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: More than one million mu of rapeseed in Shaanxi Province has basically been sown, and various places are currently strengthening the field management of rapeseed.

This year, Shaanxi Province's rapeseed sowing work was discussed and studied by the masses in various places beforehand, criticizing the erroneous idea of not attaching importance to rapeseed production in previous years, and formulated specific yield increase plans and measures, requiring the province's rapeseed yield to double next year, with an average yield of 140 jin per mu, and cultivate 500,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields, with an average yield of 240 jin per mu. Guanzhong and other places first resolutely eliminated the phenomenon of hard stubble sowing of rapeseed, the amount of fertilizer applied was also doubled compared with the past, and mixed sowing was changed to intercropping and single cropping, of which intercropping accounted for 50% of the total area and single cropping accounted for 25% of the total area. At present, the rapeseed seedlings are emerging neatly, and weeding and thinning have been carried out once each, and some places have also carried out topdressing and pest control, and the seedlings are growing very strongly. Rapeseed in northern and southern Shaanxi has also been sown successively recently.

### 四川油菜种得早种得好  陕西正加强油菜田间管理工作

    四川油菜种得早种得好
    陕西正加强油菜田间管理工作
    本报讯　记者于竞祁报道：四川省大力加强领导，实行政治挂帅和合理组织劳力，油菜播种工作又早、又多、又快、又好。
    目前，全省油菜播种已基本结束，比去年提早了一个到两个季节。据初步统计，播种面积从去年的五百多万亩扩大到六百多万亩，全省基本上实现了“胜利油菜”良种化。技术措施也贯彻的好：深耕普遍在一尺以上，播种量比去年增加一倍以上，移栽的密度都在一万株左右，施底肥五万斤以上。去年的施肥量只几千斤。
    今年四川各级党委对油菜生产抓得早、抓得紧。从8月份起，全省就从专区到县、乡、社层层制订了明年油菜生产规划，总结高产经验，展开技术传授和调剂种籽的活动。
    播种期间，正值大量农村劳力支援钢铁，为了解决“三秋”期间农活多而劳力不足的矛盾，各地着重抓了两条：一、全面安排和组织农村劳力突击队和专业队，采取分工和协作相结合，又分又合的战术，分头深耕、积肥、管理秋田，集中突击播种油菜；二、区别轻重缓急，把油菜播种期间其他农活尽量推前移后，大搞“小运动”。南部县播种期间，组织了一个“全民播种油菜”的运动，男女老少一齐上阵，以专业队为中心集中力量突击，五天多就完成了往年半个多月才能完成的播种工作，全部种上了胜利油菜。此外，利用公社“大”的有利条件，各地还大搞共产主义大协作。高山支援平坝，种得少或不种油菜的公社和生产队，支援种得多的社和队，也大大加快了播种进度。
    许多地方都把土层深厚、土质肥沃、灌、排水方便，列为种油菜地的条件，南充、内江、万县等专区不少县都做到了油菜田全是上等和中上等地。在川中丘陵区第一次出现了大面积成片的油菜田。
    现在全省农民正加紧移栽和进行秋田管理，决心争取明年油菜产量翻一番以上，达到一千三百万担到两千万担左右，有两个专区和二十个县决心成为千斤县，许多试验田计划都在五千斤以上，不少还达到一万多斤。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省一百多万亩油菜基本播种完毕，目前各地正在加强油菜的田间管理工作。
    今年陕西省的油菜播种工作，事前经过各地群众讨论研究，批判了历年不重视油菜生产的错误思想，分别制定出具体的增产方案和措施，要求明年全省油菜产量翻一番，平均亩产达到一百四十斤，并培养五十万亩大面积丰产田，平均亩产二百四十斤。关中各地首先坚决消灭了油菜的硬槎播种现象，施肥量也比过去增加了一倍，并改混作为间作、单作，其中间作占总面积的50％，单作占总面积的25％。目前油菜出苗整齐，已经锄草、间苗各一次，部分地方并进行了追肥和防虫，幼苗生长十分健壮，陕北、陕南地区油菜最近也已先后播种完毕。
