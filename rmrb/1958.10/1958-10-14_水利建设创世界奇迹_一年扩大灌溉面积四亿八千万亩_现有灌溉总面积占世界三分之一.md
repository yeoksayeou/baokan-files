Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: The People's Republic of China's Ministry of Agriculture's 1958 Communiqué on Achievements in Farmland Water Conservancy.

　　In 1958, China's farmland water conservancy construction, in the high tide of the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture, took the lead and achieved unprecedented great results. The close combination of various agricultural production increase measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and close planting played a huge role in resisting floods and droughts and ensuring this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. According to the recent instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy work, a greater water conservancy upsurge will surely be launched across the country this winter and next spring to basically realize water conservancy and ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

　　From the beginning of October last year to the end of September this year was one year of farmland water conservancy construction in 1958. Now, the huge achievements made by hundreds of millions of working people through arduous struggle in this year are announced as follows:

　　In one year, the country expanded its irrigated area by 480 million mu, improved waterlogged areas by 210 million mu, preliminarily controlled soil and water conservation areas by 300,000 square kilometers, newly built rural hydropower stations with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, and hydropower stations with a capacity of 180,000 horsepower. The total amount of earth and stone work completed was 58 billion cubic meters. At present, China's irrigated area has reached 1 billion mu, and the proportion of the total cultivated land area in the country has jumped from 31% in September 1957 to 59.5%, accounting for more than one-third of the world's total irrigated area. Judging from the speed of development, the scale of construction, and the quantity completed, the development of China's farmland water conservancy construction this year has created a miracle in the history of world water conservancy.

　　The characteristics of the farmland water conservancy construction movement this year are: early start and quick action; strong leadership and sufficient drive; large scale and long duration; many creations and good quality; large-scale collaboration and high efficiency; small investment and great results.

　　In the water conservancy upsurge, the enthusiasm and creativity of 600 million people have been fully utilized. From mountains to hills, plains, depressions, and coasts, red flags for harnessing mountains and rivers have been planted everywhere. (1) Wushan County in Gansu, Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei, Yuxi County in Yunnan, and Xiuwen County in Guizhou first established the banner of diverting water up the mountains like long vines bearing many gourds. Many areas have developed their experiences, building canals around mountains, intercepting rivers at every level, linking canals and reservoirs, and combining diversion and storage to form a complete self-flowing irrigation system in mountainous areas, solving the problem of realizing water conservancy in mountainous and hilly areas. The Yin Tao project in Gansu and the Yin Longjiang River water project in Liuzhou Prefecture, Guangxi, are even greater initiatives in the development of water conservancy in mountainous areas. (2) The experience of river network development in the Huaibei area of Anhui and the transformation of depressions in the Tianjin Prefecture of Hebei pointed out the direction for the fundamental management of vast plain areas prone to waterlogging and coastal low-lying barren alkaline areas. (3) In soil and water conservation work, various regions have promoted and developed the experiences of Daquanshan Mountain in Shanxi, Dengjiabao in Gansu, and Yuxian County in Henan, adopting methods such as digging fish-scale pits, horizontal ditches, building valley check dams, reservoir groups, closing mountains for afforestation, planting trees and grass, and terracing cultivated land, combining engineering measures with biological measures, developing from point management to large-area management, fully utilizing soil and water resources, and fundamentally transforming the appearance of mountainous areas. (4) The experience of the Manghe River in Henan, the comprehensive management of the Shaying River in Henan, the Haihe River in Hebei, and the Ningjiang River in Xingning County, Guangdong, centered on the Anning River, from top to bottom, comprehensively controlled and developed, establishing the direction of river basin management combining large, medium, and small-scale projects. (5) In irrigation management work, adapting to new agricultural production increase measures, the experiences of irrigation cultivation gardenization in Anguo County, Hebei, the double insurance of canal irrigation and well irrigation in Xushui County, Gansu's Wushan County's mountain irrigation, the underground canals in Yanshi County, Henan, the self-flowing irrigation in Hengyang Prefecture, Hunan, the transformation of saline-alkali land in Xinjiang, and the transformation of string irrigation into rotational irrigation and the transformation of rotten mud fields and cold water fields in Fujian have opened up roads for technological innovation in the irrigation industry. (6) In rural hydropower construction, the experience of plain hydropower stations in Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei, and the construction of rural hydropower stations and hydropower stations in Yongchun, Fujian, and Chongqing, Sichuan, have strongly promoted the development of rural electrification. (7) Other experiences, such as winter construction in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, increasing the utilization rate of drainage and irrigation machinery and equipment in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, digging machine wells and natural springs in Hebei and Shanxi, and the creation, modification, and promotion of tens of millions of construction, water lifting, and homemade surveying instruments, as well as cement and explosives in various regions. All of these have set good examples in water conservancy work, greatly developed the experience of previous generations in water management, and enriched the treasure house of water conservancy science and technology knowledge.

　　This year was not a year of favorable weather conditions, and the threats of drought and flood were very serious. From south to north, many areas continuously experienced severe drought from last autumn sowing until the arrival of the rainy season this year. The cumulative drought-affected area nationwide was 470 million mu. Thanks to the role played by the large number of newly built irrigation projects in various regions, 380 million mu of drought-affected land did not become disaster areas, and the remaining 90 million mu became disaster areas, but losses were also mitigated to varying degrees. In summer, heavy rainfall was concentrated in some areas, with rainfall of 300-400 millimeters in the center of the rainstorm within 20 days, and more than 500 millimeters in individual areas. According to previous years' situations, under such rainfall conditions, the estimated flood area would be about 100 million mu. Due to large-scale water storage and control of surface runoff, the flood-affected area nationwide was only 58 million mu, and the disaster-stricken area was 18 million mu, greatly reducing the severity of the disaster. Due to large-scale water conservancy construction, droughts and floods were effectively resisted, and it is estimated that grain losses were reduced by about 30 billion to 40 billion jin. At the same time, the rice planting area in the twelve provinces (regions) and cities in the north increased by more than 17 million mu, and many historical low-yield disaster areas have become rice-producing areas. The area of dry land converted to paddy fields in the south has also greatly developed. Farmland water conservancy construction, combined with a large amount of fertilizer application, deep plowing, the promotion of improved varieties, and close planting, has enabled China to achieve unprecedented bumper harvests of crops such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds this year. As stated in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy work, the farmland water conservancy construction since last winter has played a huge role in this year's flood control and drought resistance struggles, reduced the disaster-stricken area, mitigated the degree of disaster, and began to create the possibility that agricultural production can basically avoid general flood and drought disasters, so that agricultural production can develop relatively stably.

　　Such huge achievements in water conservancy construction have been achieved under the correct leadership of the Party, through the nationwide rectification movement, and on the basis of the decisive victory of the socialist revolution on the economic and ideological fronts; they have been achieved by constantly overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, planting red flags, pulling out white flags, resolutely implementing the "three main principles" of "small-scale as the main focus, storage as the main focus, and community-run as the main focus," and relying on the infinite wisdom and soaring revolutionary energy of hundreds of millions of people, working hard for a winter and going all out for a spring. Since the beginning of winter water conservancy construction, various regions have adhered to the working style of putting politics in command, secretaries taking the lead, the whole party mobilizing, the whole people launching, and implementing the mass line, and have carried forward the style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, breaking with old conventions, thereby continuously promoting the sustained development of the water conservancy upsurge. In the nationwide water conservancy construction movement, the natural landscape and economic landscape are rapidly changing, and at the same time, the spiritual outlook of hundreds of millions of people is also changing. This is the growth of the communist idea of "I for everyone, everyone for me." Many regions have seen thousands of farmers bringing their own tools and food to support neighboring townships, counties, and provinces, and using their advanced experience and advanced technology to help brother regions, so as to achieve common leap forward. This spirit of communist large-scale collaboration is an important guarantee for accelerating the realization of water conservancy and should continue to be carried forward.

　　According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy work on August 29, 1958, in order to adapt to the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, we must continue to work hard for two more winters and two more springs to basically complete water conservancy in the country's existing cultivated land and ensure a stable and bumper harvest in agricultural production. In this winter and next spring's water conservancy upsurge, we must continue to expand the irrigated area on the basis of the huge achievements already made, and according to the conditions of different regions, improve the drought and flood prevention standards of various water conservancy facilities. Preliminary planning: In 1959, the irrigated area will be expanded by 500 million mu, and the total irrigated area will reach about 1.5 billion mu, accounting for 89% of the cultivated land area; the area of waterlogged land to be treated will be 72.81 million mu; the area of preliminary control of soil and water conservation will be increased by 500,000 to 700,000 square kilometers, so that the total area of preliminary control of soil and water loss will reach 1 million to 1.2 million square kilometers, accounting for 66% to 80% of the soil and water loss area; 3.5 million kilowatts of new rural hydropower stations will be built. In areas that have been initially water conservancy, we should continue to improve and consolidate them, and achieve ten modernizations: terracing of slopes, river network development on plains, reservoir development in gullies, terraces on river channels, systematization of projects, gardenization of cultivated land, mechanization of water lifting, electrification of hydropower, diversification of aquaculture, and greening of barren mountains, barren slopes, and surrounding areas.

　　In order to successfully complete the glorious task of farmland water conservancy construction, it is necessary to earnestly understand and implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy work. Party and government leaders at all levels should take this instruction of the Central Committee as the fundamental guiding ideology for water conservancy work, correctly implement the "three main principles" of "small-scale as the main focus, storage as the main focus, and community-run as the main focus." On the premise of small-scale projects as the foundation, medium-sized projects and some necessary and possible large-scale projects must be appropriately developed, and large, medium, and small-scale projects should be combined with each other, and planned to gradually form a relatively complete water conservancy project system; accelerate the regional planning, river basin planning, and national long-term water conservancy planning of water conservancy construction; summarize, promote, and continue to develop the advanced experience of water conservancy construction in various regions; strengthen the technical reform in water conservancy construction, especially to focus on the two key points of tool improvement and improvement of operating technology, so as to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the huge task of water conservancy construction.

　　Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, and under the brilliant light of the general line, let us confidently launch a larger-scale and higher-level farmland water conservancy construction movement, work hard for a winter and spring, basically realize water conservancy in most areas, and ensure a greater leap forward in agricultural production.

    水利建设创世界奇迹
    一年扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩
    现有灌溉总面积占世界三分之一
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国农业部1958年农田水利成就公报。
    1958年我国农田水利建设，在工农业全面大跃进的高潮里，一马当先，获得史无前例的巨大成绩。水、肥、土、种、密等各项农业增产措施的密切结合，对抗御水旱灾害，保证今年农业生产的空前丰收，发挥了巨大作用。根据中共中央最近关于水利工作的指示，今冬明春全国必将掀起更大的水利高潮，基本实现水利化，保证农业生产的更大跃进。
    从去年10月初到今年9月底是1958年农田水利建设的一个年度，现在将这一年度亿万劳动人民坚苦奋战所取得的巨大成就，公报如下：
    一年期间，全国共扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，洼改治涝面积二亿一千万亩，水土保持初步控制面积三十万平方公里，新建农村水电站十万瓩，水力站十八万马力，完成土石方总量五百八十亿公方。当前我国的灌溉面积已达十亿亩，占全国耕地总面积的比例，由1957年9月份的31％跃升到59.5％，占世界灌溉总面积三分之一以上。从发展速度、建设规模、完成数量上看，今年我国农田水利建设事业的发展，创造了世界水利史上的奇迹。
    今年兴修农田水利运动的特点是：动手早，行动快；领导强，干劲足；规模大，持续久；创造多，质量好；大协作，效率高；投资少，收效宏。
    在水利高潮中，充分发挥了六亿人民的积极性和创造性，从山区到丘陵、平原、洼地、海滨，插遍了治山治水的红旗。（一）甘肃武山县、湖北襄阳专区、云南玉溪县、贵州修文县首先树立了引水上山长藤结瓜的旗帜。很多地区发展了它们的经验，盘山开渠，节节拦河，渠库相联，引蓄结合，形成山区完整的自流灌溉系统，解决了山区、丘陵区实现水利化的问题。甘肃引洮工程，广西柳州专区引龙江水工程，更是发展山区水利的伟大创举。（二）安徽淮北地区的河网化，河北天津专区的洼地改造等经验，为广大平原易涝地区和沿海低洼荒碱地区的根本治理，指出了方向。（三）在水土保持工作中，各地推广和发展了山西大泉山、甘肃邓家堡、河南禹县等地经验，采取挖鱼鳞坑、水平沟、修建谷坊、水库群、封山育林、植树种草、耕地梯田化等办法，工程措施与生物措施相结合，由点的治理发展到大面积的治理，充分利用水土资源，根本改造山区面貌。（四）河南漭河的经验，河南沙颍河、河北海河和广东兴宁县按宁江水为中心的治理，从上到下，全面控制，综合开发，确立了大、中、小型工程相结合的流域治理方向。（五）在灌溉管理工作中，适应新的农业增产措施，河北安国县的灌溉耕作园田化和徐水县渠灌井灌双保险，甘肃武山县山地灌溉，河南偃师县地下渠道，湖南衡阳专区的自流灌溉，新疆改造盐碱地，以及福建改串灌为轮灌和改造烂泥田、冷水田等经验，为灌溉事业的技术革新开辟了道路。（六）在农村水电建设中，河北天津专区的平原水电站，福建永春、四川崇庆修建农村水电站、水力站的经验，有力地促进了农村电气化事业的发展。（七）其他如东北、内蒙古冬季施工，江苏、浙江、广东等省提高排灌机械设备利用率，河北、山西打机井、挖自流泉以及各地创造改制和推广了数以千万计的施工、提水、土制测量仪器以及水泥、炸药等经验。这些都在水利工作中树立了良好的榜样，大大发展了前人治水的经验，丰富了水利科学技术知识的宝库。
    今年并不是风调雨顺的，旱涝威胁都很严重。从南到北有不少地区从去年秋播到今年雨季到来前，不断发生严重旱象，全国累计受旱面积共四亿七千万亩，由于各地新修的大量灌溉工程发挥了作用，有三亿八千万亩受旱未成灾，其余九千万亩成灾，但也在不同程度上减轻了损失。夏季部分地区暴雨集中，暴雨中心二十天降雨三、四百公厘，个别地区在五百公厘以上。按往年情况，在这种雨情下，洪涝面积估计约在一亿亩左右。由于大量蓄水，控制地面径流，全国受涝面积只有五千八百万亩，成灾面积一千八百万亩，灾情大大减轻。由于大修水利，有效地抗御了水旱灾害，估计减少粮食损失约三百亿斤到四百亿斤。同时北方十二省（区）市水稻种植面积扩大了一千七百多万亩，很多历史上的低产灾区变成了米粮川。南方旱地改水田的面积也有很大发展。农田水利建设结合大量增施肥料、深翻土地、推广优良品种和密植等各项农业增产措施，使我国今年粮、棉、油料等作物，都获得了空前大丰收。正如中共中央关于水利工作的指示中所说的，去冬以来的农田水利建设，在今年防汛抗旱斗争中，发挥了巨大作用，缩小了成灾面积，减轻了灾害程度，开始创造了农业生产能够基本上避免一般水旱灾害的可能，使农业生产能够比较稳定的发展。
    这样巨大的水利建设成就，是在党的正确领导下，经过全民整风运动，并在经济战线上、思想战线上的社会主义革命得到决定性胜利的基础上取得的；是在不断克服右倾保守思想，插红旗，拔白旗，坚决贯彻“小型为主，以蓄为主，社办为主”的三主方针，依靠亿万人民的无穷智慧和冲天革命干劲，苦干一冬，大干一春取得的。自冬修水利开始，各地都坚持了政治挂帅，书记动手，全党动员，全民发动，贯彻群众路线的工作作风，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干的风格，打破陈规旧套，从而不断地促进了水利高潮的持续发展。在全民性的水利建设运动中，迅速地改变着自然面貌、经济面貌，同时也在改变着亿万人民的精神面貌。这就是“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想的成长。不少地区成千上万的农民，自带工具、口粮，支援邻乡、邻县、邻省，并以自己的先进经验和先进技术，帮助兄弟地区，以达到共同跃进。这种共产主义大协作的精神，是加速实现水利化的一个重要保证，应当继续发扬。
    根据1958年8月29日中共中央关于水利工作的指示，为了适应工农业生产更大的跃进，我们必须再苦战两冬两春，使全国现有耕地，基本上完成水利化，保证农业生产稳定丰收。在今冬明春的水利高潮当中要在已经取得的巨大成就的基础上，适应人民公社化运动的发展，继续扩大灌溉面积，并根据不同地区条件，提高各项水利设施的抗旱防涝标准。初步规划：1959年扩大灌溉面积五亿亩，总灌溉面积达到十五亿亩左右，占耕地面积89％；治涝面积七千二百八十一万亩；增加水土保持初步控制面积五十至七十万平方公里，使初步控制水土流失总面积达到一百至一百二十万平方公里，占水土流失面积66％至80％；新建农村水电站三百五十万瓩。在已经初步水利化的地区则应继续提高、巩固，实现十化：坡地梯田化，平原河网化，沟壑川台水库化，河道阶梯化，工程系统化，耕地园田化，提水机械化，水力电气化，水产多样化，荒山荒坡四旁绿化。
    为了胜利完成农田水利建设的光荣任务，必须认真领会和贯彻执行中共中央关于水利工作的指示。各级党政领导要把中央这一指示，作为水利工作上的根本指导思想，正确贯彻“小型为主，以蓄为主，社办为主”的三主方针，在以小型工程为基础的前提下，必须适当地发展中型工程和必要的可能的某些大型工程，并使大、中、小工程相互结合，有计划地逐渐形成为比较完整的水利工程系统；加速进行水利建设的地区规划、流域规划和全国范围的较长远的水利规划；总结推广和继续发展各地的水利建设先进经验；加强水利建设中的技术改革，特别要抓紧工具改良和提高操作技术这两个关键，以保证兴修水利巨大任务的提前和超额完成。
    在党中央的正确领导下，在总路线的光辉照耀下，让我们满怀信心地掀起一个规模更大水平更高的兴修农田水利运动，大干一冬春，在大部分地区基本实现水利化，保证农业生产的更大跃进。
