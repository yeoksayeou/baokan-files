    New Tool for Large-Scale Frost Prevention
    A Hand-Pushed Anti-Frost Device Can Protect Over One Hundred Mu of Crops from Frost Damage
    (Our dispatch) Before the arrival of frost this year, the Shijiazhuang Special District Agricultural Science Institute in Hebei Province produced a hand-pushed anti-frost device that is easy to operate, produces a lot of smoke, produces smoke quickly, saves fuel, saves labor, and has a great effect. It can guarantee that no frost damage will occur in one hundred mu of land.
    This anti-frost device is simple to manufacture, uses common materials, and is easy to promote. Its main part is the smoke generator, which is made of a medium-sized gasoline drum (or a cylindrical shape made of No. 24 galvanized iron) with mud plastered on the inner wall. An air inlet and a small ash removal door are opened at the bottom of the drum, with a perforated iron clamp and grate above the air inlet. A large charging door is opened in the upper middle part of the smoke generator. The top of the cylinder is a conical movable cover, with three iron tubes rolled from No. 32 galvanized iron (the middle one is slightly thinner than the left and right ones) serving as smoke pipes connected to the smoke generator. When in use, blowing air with a bellows (fan, blower) will quickly produce thick smoke. For easy movement and transportation, the smoke generator needs to be installed on a handcart.
    The technology for operating the anti-frost device is very simple. First, place a small amount of dry firewood at the bottom of the furnace, then put random firewood, leaves, weeds, etc. into the furnace. After ignition, it cannot be fully burned, generating a large amount of thick smoke that spreads into the air through the smoke pipes. According to the institute's tests, using a general cooking blower can guarantee four hundred mu to be free from frost damage per hour; using the fan of a powder sprayer can solve the frost prevention problem for two hundred mu of land per hour; using a household bellows can solve the frost prevention problem for one hundred mu of land per hour.

    大面积防霜冻的新工具
    一部手推式防霜器能保证百亩以上庄稼不受霜冻
    本报讯　在今年霜冻来临之前，河北省石家庄专区农业科学研究所制作了操作简便，生烟多、生烟快、省燃料、省劳力、效果大的手推式防霜器，能在百亩地里保证不发生霜冻现象。
    这种防霜器制作方法简单，用料普通，易于推广。其主要部分是生烟炉，用中型汽油筒（或用二十四号白铁作成圆筒形）内壁抹泥，筒下开一入风嘴和排除残灰的小炉门，风口上面是多孔铁夹和炉条。生烟炉上中部开一投料大炉门。圆筒上面是圆锥形活盖，有用三十二号白铁卷成的三支铁筒（中间一支比左右两支稍细一些）作烟筒通生烟炉。使用时用风箱（风扇、风机）吹风，浓烟即迅速冒出。为了移动、转运方便，需将生烟炉安置在手推车上。
    操作防霜器的技术十分简便。先将干柴少许放于炉底，再将乱柴、树叶，杂草等放于炉内。点火后因不能充分燃烧，生成大量浓烟沿出烟筒散于空中。经过该所试验，用一般炊事用吹风机吹风，每小时可保证四百亩不发生霜冻；用喷粉器上的风扇吹风每小时可解决二百亩地的防霜问题；用家庭风箱吹风每小时可解决百亩地的防霜问题。（附图片）
