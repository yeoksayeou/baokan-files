    Tapping Potential from Collaboration
    Qǐ Mín

    Marx said in "Das Kapital," "Cooperation not only raises the productive power of the individual, but creates a productive power..." This statement has particularly profound guiding significance for us who are accelerating socialist construction. The tremendous achievements made by Lìshān Town in Suí County, Húběi Province, in implementing comprehensive collaboration during the Great Leap Forward are a concrete example.

    The same Lìshān Town, the same government offices and cadres, just a few months ago, when they were still "each sweeping the snow from their own doorstep," the progress of various tasks was as slow as a snail's pace. But when they criticized all kinds of ideas that were not conducive to great collaboration and implemented comprehensive, multi-faceted communist collaboration, things quickly changed. Many cadres became all-rounders, transforming from the "one-skilled" to the "three-skilled" or "five-skilled." The communist consciousness of the cadres greatly improved. After going to the countryside, they no longer only managed the work of their own agency or department, but instead, everyone "grasped everything when going to the countryside and divided the work after returning." In this way, the work efficiency of cadres increased many times over, and the work in both the town and the villages opened up a new situation of the Great Leap Forward. From this, we can see how different the results are between collaboration and non-collaboration, comprehensive collaboration and partial collaboration!

    Why does collaboration generate such tremendous power? The main reason is that it fully leverages people's work enthusiasm and potential strength. People, especially those with communist consciousness, have unlimited potential strength. Such people, when their potential is unleashed, will continuously create amazing miracles. We can imagine that when cadres working in postal and telecommunications in this town can transform from "one-skill experts" to "five-skill experts"; when cadres working in banks, whether they are directors, accountants, or savings clerks, can replace each other and work interchangeably, achieving a situation where things are idle but people are not; when medical personnel change from the past "three-no-diagnoses" to workers who are available at any time and proactively go to the countryside to implement mobile medical services; when cadres working in the countryside or in the city are all "not going empty-handed, and not returning with empty shoulders," how could they not create miracles? How could various tasks not forge ahead in a Great Leap Forward?

    However, even today, some people, and some leaders of units, still do not have a clear or deep understanding of the significance of communist great collaboration, especially the significance of tapping people's potential strength from collaboration. It is said that there is such a leader who recently heard that he was required to fight with two fists, to grasp steel on one hand and grain on the other, and he began to complain, saying that there was insufficient labor, not enough manpower, and that there could not be two work focuses at the same time, and so on. In fact, these comrades often only see things but not people when observing things. Even when they see people, they only see them as isolated individuals, and do not see people's dynamism and their power to collaborate. They only see that there are many tasks and that the tasks are urgent, but they do not know that the tasks are all completed by people, and that people have unlimited potential. They do not know that the art of leadership lies in doing a good job in people's work and being good at maximizing the wisdom and enthusiasm of each individual. Experience proves that organizing communist comprehensive collaboration is an important method for unleashing people's potential. Therefore, as long as the organization is good and the collaboration is good, even the biggest and most urgent tasks can definitely be completed. Countless examples of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture have already set a good example. In the future, more examples will surely emerge in the greater leap forward. It is hoped that those who view things and the masses metaphysically will change their views and unleash their infinite potential under the organization of great collaboration.

    从协作中挖潜力
    启民
    马克思在“资本论”中说“协作不仅提高了个人的生产力，并且创造了一种生产力……。”这句话对正在加速建设社会主义的我们说来，具有特别深刻的指导意义。湖北随县厉山镇在大跃进中实行全面大协作所获得的巨大成就，就是一个具体的例证。
    同样一个厉山镇，同样是这些机关和干部，几个月以前，当他们还是“各人自扫门前雪”的时候，各项工作都像蜗牛走路一样进步很慢。但是当他们批判了各种不利于大协作的思想，实行了全面的、多边的共产主义大协作后，很快就变了样子。许多干部成了多面手，由过去的“一员”变成现在的“三员”或“五员”，干部的共产主义觉悟大大提高了，下乡后不再是各人只管本机关本部门的工作，而是人人“下乡一把抓，回来再分家”了。这样，干部的工作效率成倍地提高，无论镇里或乡上的工作都打开了大跃进的新局面。由此可见，协作与不协作，全面的协作与部分的协作，其结果多么不同！
    协作，为什么会产生这样巨大的力量呢？最主要的原因是，彻底发挥了人的工作积极性和潜在力量。人，特别是具有共产主义觉悟的人，他们的潜在力量是无限的，这样的人，发挥了潜力会不断地创造出惊人的奇迹。我们可以想像得到，当这个镇作邮电工作的干部都能由“一员通”变成“五员通”；作银行工作的干部不论主任、会计或储蓄员，都能互相代替，交叉工作，作到物闲人不闲的时候；当医务人员由过去的“三不诊”变成随叫随到和主动下乡实行巡回医疗的工作者的时候；当不论下乡或进城工作的干部，个个都是“人不空去，肩不空回”的时候，还能不创造奇迹吗？各项工作还能不勇往直前地大跃进吗？
    但是，至今还有一些人，还有一些单位的领导者，对共产主义大协作的意义，特别是对从协作中挖掘人的潜在力量的意义，仍然认识不清，理解不深。据说有这样一个领导人员，最近一听说要叫两个拳头作战，要一手抓钢铁，一手抓粮食，就叫起苦来，说什么劳力不足啦，人手不够啦，工作重心同时不能有两个啦，等等。其实，这些同志观察事物，往往只见物，不见人，见人也只是把人看成一个个孤立的东西，而没有看到人的能动性和他们进行协作的力量。他们只看到任务多，任务紧，而不知任务都是人来完成的，而人却是有着无限潜力的。他们不知道领导的艺术就在于做好人的工作、善于最大限度地发挥每一个人的智慧和积极性。经验证明，组织共产主义的全面大协作是发挥人的潜力的重要方法。因此，只要组织得好，协作得好，再大再紧的任务也一定能够完成。工农业大跃进的无数事例已经作出了榜样，今后在更大的跃进中一定会出现更多的榜样，希望形而上学地看待事物和群众的人改变自己的观点，在组织大协作下发挥无穷无尽的潜力吧。
