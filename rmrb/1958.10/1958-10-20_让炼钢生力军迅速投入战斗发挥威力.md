Let the New Force of Steelmaking Quickly Join the Battle and Exert Its Power
By Our Staff Commentator

Since late August, thousands of new converters have been built across the country. This batch of converters is a powerful new force on the steel production front, responsible for more than one-fifth of the year's steel output. It is obvious that enabling these new converters to go into production as soon as possible and to give full play to their effectiveness is of great significance for ensuring the early completion of this year's steel production task.

However, the current problem is that about half of these converters cannot be put into production quickly due to incomplete auxiliary equipment. Among the furnaces that have already been put into production, some are also unable to fully exert their effectiveness due to insufficient auxiliary equipment. This situation shows that, in order to achieve a sharp increase in steel production, one of the most urgent problems to be solved at present is to quickly complete the sets of newly built converters and put them into production as soon as possible. Therefore, the local Party committees should personally take charge of this matter. First of all, a thorough inspection should be carried out on the converters that have been built but not yet put into production and those that are under construction to find out what auxiliary equipment is missing and how much is needed. Then, immediately organize the relevant machinery factories to cooperate closely and rush to manufacture them. In the shortest possible time, ensure that whatever is missing is available, and that the quantity meets the need, and that all items are of excellent quality. Secondly, the allocation and distribution of auxiliary equipment should be expedited. Currently, there is a situation where some parts are surplus in Area A, but insufficient in Area B, while some parts stockpiled in Area B are exactly what Area C urgently needs. Due to a lack of mutual understanding and timely coordination, everyone is "missing some instruments." Therefore, while expediting manufacturing, all areas should also expedite coordination. As many sets as can be assembled should be put into production immediately. Regardless of which unit or system they belong to, they must all obey unified scheduling; it is absolutely not allowed for each to hold half a set, without mutual assistance, thereby affecting production.

Among the furnaces that have already been put into production, there are still many that have not fully exerted their effectiveness because they have not broken through technical barriers. According to past experience, a one-ton converter could generally produce thirty heats a day, but now not many can achieve twenty heats a day. At the same time, the lifespan of the furnaces is also relatively short, often requiring shutdown for maintenance after continuous production of ten or so heats, and in the worst cases, even after only one or two heats. The poor production performance of these new furnaces is mainly due to a lack of experience. In the past, steelmaking in our country mainly used open-hearth furnaces and electric furnaces, with very few converters, so there were also very few skilled workers and technicians in this field. Now that a large number of converters have been put into production, the technical strength is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, all steel plants must fully rely on veteran skilled workers and experienced technicians. In areas where there were no steel plants in the past, full reliance should be placed on the college students and technicians sent by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Although these people are not experts in converter steelmaking, they understand general smelting technology and will master converters more quickly. For these skilled workers, students, and technicians, all enterprises and regions must use them in a concentrated manner, first breaking through technical barriers on one or two furnaces, accumulating experience, and adopting the method of masters leading apprentices, apprentices becoming masters, experienced masters leading new masters, and new masters leading new apprentices to conduct on-site training and rapidly expand technical strength in batches. In this way, we can strive to make all converters put into production obey our commands and fully exert their due power in the shortest possible time.

Finally, let us repeat one more sentence: The task undertaken by these new converters accounts for more than one-fifth of the 10.7 million tons of steel. In order to seize this "one-fifth," all the soldiers who manufacture and use converters must act immediately. Seize steel from time, race against every second, and not yield an inch of land. This is our battle cry!

    让炼钢生力军迅速投入战斗发挥威力
    本报评论员
    8月下旬以来，全国各地新制成了上千座转炉。这批转炉是钢铁生产战线上一支强有力的生力军，担负着占全年钢产量五分之一以上的生产任务。显然不用说明，让这批新转炉及早投入生产和充分发挥效能，对保证提前完成今年钢产量的任务，具有何等重大的意义。
    但是，目前的问题是，这些转炉中有一半左右因为配套设备不齐全还不能很快投入生产。已经投入生产的炉，也有一部分由于附属设备不足而不能充分发挥效能。这个情况说明，要使钢产量猛烈上涨，当前迫切需要解决的问题之一，就是赶紧把新制成的转炉配成套，及早投入生产。因此，各地党委应该亲自下手抓这件事情。首先要对已经建成还没有投入生产的和正在建设中的转炉，进行一次清查，摸清缺少什么附属设备，缺多少？然后立即组织有关的机械工厂，密切协作，突击赶造，要在最短的时间内做到缺什么有什么，缺多少有多少，件件都是优等质量。其次，要抓紧配套设备的调剂分配工作。目前存在着这样的情况：某些配件甲地有余，乙地却不足，而乙地积压的某种配件，又正是丙地急需的。由于彼此不了解情况，没有及时调剂，结果大家都是“锣齐鼓不齐”。因此，各地在抓紧制造的同时，也要抓紧调剂，能配成几套，就先配成几套立即投入生产。不论是属于哪个单位或哪个系统的，都必须服从统一调度；决不容许各持半套，互不协助而影响生产。
    在已经投入生产的炉子中，现在还有很多因为没有突破技术关而没有充分发挥效能。按照过去的情形，一个一吨能力的转炉，一般的一天能出三十炉，但是现在能够达到日出二十炉的还不多。同时炉子的寿命也比较短，常常连续生产十来炉就需要停产检修，最坏的甚至只开一两炉就要检修。这些新炉子的生产情况不好，主要是因为缺乏经验，过去我国炼钢主要是用平炉和电炉，转炉很少，因此这方面的技术工人和技术人员也很少。现在大批转炉投入生产，技术力量远远不能满足需要。因此，为了解决这个问题，各个钢铁厂必须充分依靠老技术工人和有经验的技术人员，原来没有钢铁厂的地方，要充分依靠冶金工业部派下去的大学生和技术人员，这些人虽然不是转炉炼钢的内行，但是懂得一般的冶炼技术，掌握转炉会快一些。对于这些技术工人、学生和技术人员，各企业、各地区都要集中使用，先在一两个炉子上突破技术关，积累经验，采取师傅带徒弟，徒弟变师傅，老师傅带新师傅，新师傅带新徒弟的办法，进行现场训练，成批地迅速壮大技术力量。这样，我们就可以争取在最短的时间内让所有投入生产的转炉都听从使唤，充分发挥它们应有的威力。
    最后，让我们再重复一句：这些新转炉所担负的任务，占一千零七十万吨钢的五分之一以上。为了夺取这“五分之一”，一切制造和使用转炉的战士们要立即行动起来。向时间夺钢，分秒必争，寸土不让，这就是我们的战斗口号！
