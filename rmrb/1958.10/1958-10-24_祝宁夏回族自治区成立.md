    Congratulating the Establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
    Lin Boqu
    Throughout China are various ethnic groups, whose unity today is unprecedented. Establishing regional autonomy in Ningxia, founding the government and building its base in Yinchuan. Politics takes command in all matters, with workers and farmers competing and a hundred flowers blooming brightly. The people love the commune even more, achieving twenty years of progress in a single day.

    祝宁夏回族自治区成立
    林伯渠中华遍布各民族，于今团结史无先。划区自治兴宁夏，开府建基始银川。政治挂帅万事理，工农评比百花鲜。人民更爱公社好，一日跃进二十年。
