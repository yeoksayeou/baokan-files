To complete this year's pig iron production plan and meet the needs of producing 10.07 million tons of steel after more than a month of hard work, seems to be relatively certain. This is because we have found the "small, indigenous, mass" approach, with more than 700,000 indigenous blast furnaces built nationwide. If more than half of them can be quickly put into production, and more than half of those can operate normally, then the pig iron produced by these indigenous blast furnaces, plus the pig iron produced by modern large blast furnaces, will guarantee the supply for steelmaking and the cast iron needs of the machinery industry.

To say "relatively certain" and "guaranteed" does not, of course, mean that no effort is needed. The situation on the pig iron production front is different from what it was before National Day. From a positive point of view, the number of furnaces has increased, initial experience in iron smelting has been gained, many indigenous blast furnaces have been tested, and cadres and the masses have initially mastered the technology. However, from the perspective of difficulties, the situation is as follows: First, there are not as many people engaged in pig iron production as before. Before National Day, 50 million people rushed to the steel front, most of whom were concentrated in iron smelting. This was one of the important reasons why the "big satellite" of nearly 300,000 tons of pig iron production per day could be launched on September 29. Now, the mass movement for steelmaking has been launched, the autumn harvest and planting in agriculture are imminent, and the entire population must also be involved in copper and aluminum smelting. It is no longer possible to concentrate so many people on the iron smelting front, and the trend in the future is to produce the same amount, or even more, pig iron with fewer people. Second, the climate is not as good as before. Severe cold is approaching in the north, and continuous autumn rains in the south pose a serious threat to the production of indigenous blast furnaces. Without proper cold and rain protection measures, indigenous blast furnaces cannot produce iron normally, or even cannot produce iron at all. Third, the requirements for indigenous iron production should be higher than before. Previously, the goal was to pass the "iron production barrier," and any iron production, no matter how poor, was considered a victory. Now, attention must be paid to quality and cost. Sintered iron should be eliminated, and costs should be reduced as much as possible. All of this indicates that although completing the pig iron production plan is relatively certain, there are still many new problems under the new situation. Our task in pig iron production is to consolidate, improve, and continue to expand the achievements in pig iron production while requiring even higher standards than before.

How can we consolidate, improve, and continue to expand our achievements? Here, we want to focus on the issue of furnace types. The furnace is the foundation of pig iron production. Whether the furnace is good or not has a decisive impact on the output, quality, and cost of pig iron production. Currently, our 700,000-plus indigenous blast furnaces are of all kinds, some good and some bad. Many of these furnaces are good, such as the underground indigenous blast furnace clusters in Yuxian County, Henan Province, introduced in today's newspaper. This type of furnace is not only quick to build and saves materials, but also simple to operate, highly efficient in production, produces good quality iron, and has a long furnace life. In addition, this type of furnace can retain heat, which can solve the problem of winter production, and rain protection is also relatively easy. An indigenous blast furnace with so many advantages can be considered a treasure. If all of the nation's 700,000-plus indigenous blast furnaces had as many advantages as the underground indigenous blast furnaces in Yuxian County, then the problems of output, quality, cost, winter production, and rain protection for indigenous blast furnace production would not be difficult to solve. It would also be easier to consolidate, improve, and continue to expand the achievements in pig iron production.

The problem is that among the 700,000-plus indigenous blast furnaces, a large proportion of them have poor furnace types. Some cannot produce iron normally, some only produce sintered iron, and some only produce slag but no iron. There are also some indigenous blast furnaces that have significant advantages in certain aspects, but also have serious shortcomings in other aspects. For example, the output is relatively high, but the quality is not very good, or the quality is relatively good, but the furnace often malfunctions. Thus, although we have built 700,000-plus indigenous blast furnaces, mobilized tens of millions of people, and achieved great results, it must be admitted that the labor of some of these people has not achieved the desired results. They dug out ore, transported it to the furnace, and worked hard day and night, but due to the defects of the furnace, they were unable to produce iron; or although they produced iron, the output, quality, and cost could not keep up with others.

This disparity in achievements is unavoidable in the early stages of the movement. Building so many indigenous blast furnaces at once meant that everyone lacked experience and could only explore and create on their own, resulting in good and bad furnaces being built. Only after the furnaces are built, put into production, and tested in practice, can it be determined which type of furnace is better and which type is worse. Moreover, even the better furnaces can only be perfected after practice, discovering their structural defects, and further improving them. The underground indigenous blast furnace clusters in Yuxian County were only equipped with ten major advantages after being put into production and continuously improved.

However, now that more than a month of practice has made it clear that some furnaces are better and can produce more, faster, better, and more economically, and some furnaces are worse and cannot produce more, faster, better, and more economically, good furnace types should be gradually used to replace bad furnace types. Especially at a time when labor is extremely tight, the weather is turning cold, production conditions are poor, and improving quality and reducing costs cannot be delayed, it is even more necessary to use good furnace types to replace bad furnace types, so that every person invested in the iron smelting front can play the greatest role, and every furnace of iron can be of high quality and low price.

Therefore, we suggest that each province (city) and autonomous region summarize the experience of various indigenous blast furnaces. For places that have not yet completed their furnace construction plans and are preparing to continue building furnaces, they must select several types of indigenous blast furnaces that are suitable for local terrain, climate, ore, fuel, and other building materials, and can produce more, faster, better, and more economically, as models for widespread promotion, in order to avoid detours. For places that have already completed their furnace construction plans, they should also select several of the best furnace types from the various furnace types in the local area, promote them, and gradually replace those furnaces that cannot produce normally, or absorb the advantages of good furnace types to transform those furnaces that cannot produce normally. Although this takes some effort, it is absolutely necessary.

Having quantity before quality, and moving from popularization to improvement, is the law of development. When we have not yet built many indigenous blast furnaces, it is impossible to talk about selecting furnace types. Now that we have 700,000-plus indigenous blast furnaces, if we do not pay attention to selecting good furnace types, widely promoting them, and gradually replacing bad furnace types, it will bring losses to the work. The reason why pig iron production fluctuates greatly in some places is that good furnace types have not yet been promoted, so that most furnaces can produce stably and normally. As long as good furnace types are popularized, and most furnaces can produce more, faster, better, and more economically, consolidating, improving, and continuing to expand the achievements in pig iron production will have a reliable material foundation.

Of course, promoting good furnace types is only one issue in consolidating, improving, and continuing to expand the achievements in pig iron production. In addition to this, digging, transporting, smelting, and political and ideological work must all continue to be firmly grasped. We believe that as long as the leaders in various regions, while paying special attention to the mass movement for steelmaking, do not relax their leadership over pig iron production, it is entirely possible to consolidate, improve, and continue to expand the achievements in pig iron production with less manpower.

### 要选定和推广好炉型

    要选定和推广好炉型
    经过一个多月的苦战，完成今年的生铁生产计划，满足生产一千零七十万吨钢的需要，看来已经比较有把握了。这是因为我们找到了“小、土、群”的办法，全国建成的土高炉已达七十多万座，如果其中半数以上能够迅速投入生产，又有半数以上能够正常生产，那么这些土高炉生产的生铁加上现代化大高炉生产的生铁，供应炼钢以及机械工业铸铁的需要，就有了保证。
    说“已经比较有把握了”和“有了保证”，当然并不是说就不需要努力了。目前生铁战线上的情况，同国庆前夕比较起来，已经有了变化。从好的方面看，炉子的数目增加了，炼铁的经验已经初步摸索到了，许多土高炉已经过了考验，干部和群众也初步掌握了技术。但是，从困难方面看，则有如下的情况：第一、用在生铁生产方面的人没有从前那么多了。国庆前夕，五千万人奔赴钢铁前线，其中多数又集中在炼铁方面，这是9月29日能放出日产生铁近三十万吨的“大卫星”的重要原因之一。现在，炼钢的群众运动已经开展起来，农业秋收秋种刻不容缓，炼铜炼铝也要全民动手，再在炼铁战线上集中那样多的人，已不可能，并且今后的趋势是用更少的人生产同样多的、甚至更多的生铁。第二、气候不如以前了。北方严寒将届，南方秋雨绵绵，这对土高炉的生产是一个严重的威胁。没有妥善的御寒防雨措施，土高炉就不能正常出铁，甚至根本不能出铁。第三、对土铁生产的要求应该比以前提高一些。以前是过“出铁关”，好歹炼出铁来，就是胜利。现在要讲究质量、讲究成本。烧结铁应该消灭，成本要尽可能降低。凡此种种，都说明完成生铁生产计划虽然比较有把握了，但在新的形势下还有许多新的问题。我们在生铁生产上的任务，就是要在要求还比以前高的情况下，巩固、提高和继续扩大生铁生产的战果。
    怎样巩固、提高和继续扩大战果呢？这里，我们想着重谈一谈炉型的问题。炉子是生铁生产的基础。炉子好不好，对生铁生产的产量、质量、成本，都有着决定性的影响。目前我们所有的七十多万座土高炉，可说是各式各样，良莠不齐的。其中有很多炉子是好的，今天本报介绍的河南省禹县地下土高炉群就是一种。这种炉子不但建造快、用料省，而且操作简单，生产效率高，铁的质量好，炉子寿命长。此外，这种炉子能保温，可以解决过冬的问题，雨天防备也比较容易。一个土高炉能够兼有这么多的优点，可算是一宝。如果全国七十多万座土高炉都能像禹县的地下土高炉一样，具有这许多优点，那么土高炉生产的产量问题、质量问题、成本问题以及过冬问题、防雨问题都不难解决。巩固、提高和继续扩大生铁生产的战果也就比较容易了。
    问题是现在七十多万座土高炉中，还有很大一部分炉子炉型不好，有的不能正常出铁，有的只出烧结铁、有的出渣不出铁。还有一些土高炉虽然在某几个方面有显著的优点，但在另一些方面又有严重的缺点，例如产量比较高但质量不大好，或者质量也比较好但炉子常常出毛病。这样，虽然我们建了七十多万座土高炉，动员了几千万人，取得了很大的成绩。但也不能不承认，这当中有一部分人付出的劳动没有得到应有的效果。他们挖出矿石，运到炉边，日夜苦炼，但由于炉子的缺陷，没有能炼出铁来；或者虽然炼出铁来，但产量、质量、成本都赶不上别人。
    这种战果的悬殊，在运动的初期是难免的。一下子建设这么多的土高炉，大家都没有经验，只能各自摸索、创造，因而建成的炉子有好有坏。只有把炉子建成了，投入生产，经过实践，才能判明哪一种炉子比较好，哪一种炉子比较差。并且，即便是比较好的炉子，也只有经过实践，发现自己构造上的缺点，进一步加以改进，才能臻于完善。禹县的地下土高炉群就是投入生产后，经过不断的改进，才兼备了十大优点的。
    但是，既然经过一个多月来的实践，已经判明有一些炉子比较好，能够多快好省地进行生产，有一些炉子比较差，不能多快好省地进行生产，就应该逐步用好的炉型来代替不好的炉型。特别是在当前劳动力极其紧张，天气转寒，生产条件不好，而提高质量，降低成本又不容迟疑，因而要求投入炼铁战线的每一个人力都能发挥最大的作用，每一炉铁都能物美价廉的时候，更需要用好的炉型来代替不好的炉型，使每一座土高炉都能多快好省地进行生产。
    因此，我们建议，各省（市）和自治区总结各种土高炉的经验，对于还没有完成建炉计划和还准备继续建炉的地方，一定要选定几种适合本地地形、气象、矿石、燃料和其他建筑材料情况的，能够多快好省地进行生产的土高炉的炉型，作为范本，普遍推广，以便少走弯路。对于已经完成建炉计划的地方，也要从当地各种各样的炉型中选择几种最好的炉型，加以推广，逐步代替那些不能正常生产的炉子，或者吸取好的炉型的优点，来改造那些不能正常生产的炉子。这样做虽然费一些事，但却是完全必要的。
    有了数量才有质量，由普及到提高，这是事物发展的规律。当我们还没有建造多少土高炉的时候，就不可能来谈论选择炉型的问题。当我们有了七十多万土高炉的时候，再不注意选择好的炉型，普遍推广，逐步代替不好的炉型，就要给工作带来损失，现在有些地方的生铁产量忽高忽低，起伏很大。重要原因之一，就是还没推广好的炉型，使大部分炉子都能稳定地、正常地生产。只要普及了好的炉型，大部分炉子都能多快好省地进行生产，巩固、提高和继续扩大生铁生产的战果，就有了可靠的物质基础。
    当然，推广好的炉型，只是巩固、提高和继续扩大生铁生产战果的一个问题。除此以外，挖、运、炼以及政治思想工作等等，都需继续抓紧。我们相信，只要各地领导在特别抓紧炼钢的群众运动的同时，不要放松对生铁生产的领导，用更少的人力，巩固、提高和继续扩大生铁生产的战果，是完全可能的。
