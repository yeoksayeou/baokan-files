    The Flower of Friendship Blooms in the Liupan Mountains

    In the Liupan Mountain region of Guyuan County, there is a joint agricultural cooperative called the Liuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative, made up of Hui and Han farmers, which people call "The Flower of Friendship."

    The Liuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative was originally formed by merging five elementary cooperatives. In the very first year of establishing the elementary cooperatives, the Han-populated Liuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative needed to set up a threshing ground, but there was no large, flat area near the village. The Hui farmers of the Qianjin Cooperative immediately exchanged their flat land near Liuzhuang for it. That autumn, the Qianjin Cooperative lacked sufficient labor, and the crops could not be harvested. The snowy season was approaching, and delays were impossible. When the Liuzhuang Cooperative learned of this, they immediately organized labor, vehicles, and livestock to help the Qianjin Cooperative harvest for a full four days. Afterward, the Hui and Han farmers often helped each other, and their friendship deepened daily. Some Hui cooperative members said, "Hui and Han unity is truly as close as family." In the autumn of 1956, at the urgent request of the Hui and Han cooperative members, the Hui and Han farmers of the six mountain villages jointly established an advanced cooperative.

    From then on, the Hui and Han cooperative members learned from each other, produced together, and were intimately connected within the same cooperative. This summer, the Liuzhuang Cooperative suffered a hailstorm, with the Hui team being the most severely affected. The Hui and Han cooperative members of other teams organized a total of nineteen shock brigades to carry out emergency rescue efforts, ensuring that the original severely damaged crops on more than 1,000 mu still achieved 70% of their expected harvest; the more than 2,000 mu of flax yielded an average of eighty jin per mu, an increase of twenty jin compared to last year. In addition to sideline production, the income of the cooperative members also increased compared to last year.

    "Unity is strength! Unity is happiness!" This is the deep feeling of every cooperative member in this joint Hui and Han cooperative. Now, the cooperative members are joyfully discussing the establishment of a people's commune with the cooperative members of nearby agricultural cooperatives.

    友谊花开六盘山
    在固原县六盘山区，有一个回汉族农民联合组成的六庄农业社，人们管它叫“友谊之花”。
    六庄农业社原先是由五个初级社合并建成的。还在建立初级社第一年，汉民的刘庄农业社需要设一个打谷场，但靠近庄边没有大块平地，回族农民的前进社立即就把他们靠近刘家庄的一块平地兑换了。那年秋天，前进社因劳力不足，庄稼收不回来，眼看就到风雪季节，不能再拖延。刘家庄社知道了这件事，马上就组织劳力、车辆、牲畜，帮助前进社收割了整整四天。以后，回汉族农民经常互相帮助，友谊日益深厚，有的回民社员说：“回汉团结真是亲如一家。”1956年秋天，在回汉族社员的迫切要求下，六个山庄的回汉族农民联合成立了一个高级社。
    从此，回汉族社员在一个社里互相学习，一起生产，亲密无间。今年夏天，六庄社遭受雹灾，回民队受灾较重，其他队的回汉族社员共组织了十九个突击队，进行紧急挽救，使原来受灾严重的一千多亩庄稼，收成仍达到70％；两千多亩胡麻亩产平均八十斤，比去年还增产二十斤，再加上副业生产，社员收入比去年还有所增加。
    “团结就是力量！团结就是幸福。”这是这个回汉联合社每个社员的深切体会。现在，这个社的社员又在欢天喜地地和附近的农业社社员酝酿建立人民公社。
