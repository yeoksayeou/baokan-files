Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi received all members of six Japanese delegations who were invited to visit China this afternoon.

These six delegations are: the Japan-China Friendship Association Delegation headed by Matsumoto Jiichiro, the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Delegation headed by Kazami Akira, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Delegation headed by Kaneda Tomitaro, the Japan Central Metal Joint Struggle Council Delegation headed by Uchida Kazuo, the Japan Peace Delegation, and the Japan Korin Memorial Exhibition Delegation headed by Nakagawa Issei.

During the meeting, Premier Zhou held talks with the Japanese guests for more than two hours on the Taiwan issue and Sino-Japanese relations.

When talking about the Taiwan issue, Premier Zhou reiterated the Chinese people's position that they must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He said that Taiwan will always return to the People's Republic of China, and the conspiracy of "two Chinas" is bound to fail; it's only a matter of time. As for some people internationally attempting to separate Taiwan from China and place it under international co-management, and even a very small number of people in Japan advocating that Taiwan be ceded to Japan, these are dreams and absolutely impossible; the Chinese people resolutely oppose them.

Premier Zhou pointed out that the U.S. government must abandon its policy of aggression and war, withdraw all its troops from the Taiwan Strait area, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. He said that there has been no war between China and the United States, so there is no question of a "ceasefire." The problem now is that the United States must stop playing with fire, from not escorting to a complete withdrawal of troops. If this is achieved, the Taiwan Strait will be calm. If U.S. troops continue to stay there, there will be military typhoons in the Taiwan Strait every day. Since the U.S. troops came on their own, they must leave on their own. Mr. Kazami Akira is right to say that for Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, "of the thirty-six stratagems, reconciliation is the best," and for the United States, "of the thirty-six stratagems, withdrawal is the best." This is the best suggestion for the American people and the best advice for the U.S. government. The later they leave, the more passive they become.

Premier Zhou said that U.S. troops will eventually withdraw from the Taiwan Strait, just as they will withdraw from their military bases in Japan and all military bases around the world. From this point of view, the struggles of the Chinese and Japanese people have something in common. Both peoples demand that the U.S. government abandon its policies of aggression and war. The Japanese people oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following the United States, and we support the Japanese people's position.

When talking about Sino-Japanese relations, Premier Zhou pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is following the U.S. policy of aggression, is hostile to the Chinese people, attempts to rearm Japan, revive militarism, let the Japanese fight for the Americans, and drag the Japanese people into a disastrous situation, which is resolutely opposed by the Chinese and Japanese people. The Chinese and Japanese people must carry out a joint struggle against the U.S. policy of aggression and war, and against imposing war on the two peoples.

Premier Zhou said that the Chinese people love peace and are willing to be friendly with the Japanese people. We support the Japanese people's desire to strive for national independence, for peaceful neutrality, and for the development of their own economy, but we resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of following the United States and being hostile to China. The Chinese people's position has been like this in the past, is like this now, and will not change in the future. We should work together for peaceful coexistence, for national independence, for the independent development of the economies of all countries, against foreign interference and aggression, against war, against developed industrial countries exploiting backward countries by using privileges, and against the exploitative policies of Western colonialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that some people in the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet have made a big mistake; they have overestimated the strength of the Americans and underestimated the strength of the Chinese and Japanese people. The Americans are nothing great; they foolishly disperse their military forces all over the world, so they are beaten everywhere. If one link in this American front is broken, the entire line is broken.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also expressed the hope that more peace-loving Japanese non-governmental organizations will come to China for visits in the future, to pave the way for the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people.

During the meeting, Matsumoto Jiichiro, Kazami Akira, Kaneda Tomitaro, Uchida Kazuo, and Nakagawa Issei all expressed their agreement with Premier Zhou's remarks, unanimously condemned the U.S. imperialist provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait, expressed opposition to the conspiracy of "two Chinas," stated their readiness to take practical actions after returning home to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and the early restoration of normal Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and congratulated the Chinese people on the victory of liberating Jinmen, Matsu, and the Penghu Islands in Taiwan. Premier Zhou thanked the Japanese friends for their support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Jinmen, Matsu, the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, and oppose U.S. military provocations. He wished the Japanese people victory on the road to progress, and wished the success of the Japanese people's National Congress for Opening Japan-China Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, which will be held in Tokyo on October 8.

    周总理接见日本六个代表团时谈台湾问题
    美国应从不护航到全部撤军
    中日两国人民必须共同斗争反对美国侵略政策
    新华社7日讯　周恩来总理和陈毅副总理今天下午接见了应邀来我国访问的日本六个代表团的全体人员。
    这六个代表团是：以松本治一郎为首的日中友好协会访华代表团，以风见章为首的日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团，以兼田富太郎为首的日本工会总评议会代表团，以内田一夫为首的日本中央金属共斗会议访华代表团，访华日本和平代表团，以中川一政为首的日本光琳纪念展览访华代表团。
    接见的时候，周总理同日本来宾们就台湾问题和中日关系问题作了两个多小时的谈话。
    在谈到台湾问题的时候，周总理重申中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马的立场，坚决反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，台湾总是要归还中华人民共和国的，“两个中国”的阴谋一定要失败，这只是时间迟早的问题。至于国际上有些人企图把台湾从中国分裂出去，交由国际共管，甚至在日本有极少数人主张把台湾划给日本，这些都是梦想，是绝对做不到的，中国人民坚决反对。
    周总理指出，美国政府必须放弃它的侵略政策和战争政策，从台湾海峡地区撤走它的一切军队，停止对中国内政的干涉。他说，中美之间没有发生战争，谈不到“停火”。现在的问题是美国必须停止玩火，从不护航到全部撤军，这一点如果实现，台湾海峡将风平浪静。如果美国军队继续留在那里，台湾海峡将每天都有军事台风。美国军队既然自己来了，就得自己走。风见章先生说得对，对台湾蒋介石来说，是“三十六计，和为上计”，对美国来说，是“三十六计，走为上计”，这是对美国人民的最好建议，也是对美国政府的最好的劝告。他们晚走一天，也就被动一天。
    周总理说，美国军队终有一天要从台湾海峡撤走，正如同它要从它在日本的军事基地和全世界一切军事基地上撤走一样，从这一点上说，中日两国人民的斗争有着共同性。两国人民都要求美国政府放弃侵略政策和战争政策。日本人民反对岸信介政府追随美国的政策，我们支持日本人民的这个立场。
    在谈到中日两国关系的问题时，周总理指出，岸信介政府追随美国的侵略政策，敌视中国人民，企图重新武装日本，复活军国主义，让日本人替美国人打仗，把日本人民拖到灾难深重的境地，这是中日两国人民所坚决反对的。中日两国人民必须进行共同的斗争，反对美国的侵略政策和战争政策，反对把战争强加在两国人民的头上。
    周总理说，中国人民爱好和平，愿意同日本人民友好。对于日本人民争取民族独立，争取和平中立和发展本国经济的愿望，我们是支持的，但是坚决反对岸信介政府追随美国敌视中国的政策。中国人民的这个立场过去是这样，现在是这样，将来也不会改变。我们应该共同为和平共处，为民族独立，为各国经济的独立发展而共同努力，反对外来的干涉和侵略，反对战争，反对工业发达的国家利用特权剥削落后的国家，反对西方殖民主义的剥削政策。
    陈毅副总理说，岸信介内阁的某些人犯了一个大错误，他们过高地估计了美国人的力量，过低地估计了中国人民和日本人民的力量。美国人并没有甚么了不起，他们愚蠢地把军事力量分散在全世界，这样就到处都挨打。美国的这条战线，只要一个环节被突破，就全线被突破。
    陈毅副总理还希望今后有更多的爱好和平的日本民间团体到中国来访问，为发展中日两国人民的友好关系开辟道路。
    接见的时候，松本治一郎、风见章、兼田富太郎、内田一夫和中川一政都表示赞同周总理的谈话，一致谴责美帝国主义在台湾海峡的挑衅行为，表示反对“两个中国”的阴谋，准备回国后要以实际行动促进中日人民间的友好和中日邦交的早日恢复正常，并祝贺中国人民解放金门马祖和台湾澎湖列岛的胜利。周总理感谢日本朋友对中国人民解放金门马祖台湾澎湖列岛以及反对美国军事挑衅的正义斗争的支持。祝日本人民在进步的道路上胜利前进，并预祝10月8日在东京召开的日本人民打开日中关系禁止核武装国民大会的成功。
