American Aggressors Serve as Negative Teachers for Us
"Hongqi" Magazine Commentator

With American robbers standing beside the bed of the Chinese people, every Chinese person cannot help but further awaken and cannot help but become more tense in their work. With soaring enthusiasm, we must strengthen our national power to effectively deal with this enemy.

American aggressors bully us, but in many ways, they serve as negative teachers for us:

First, American aggressors bully us because our steel production is still too low. This requires us to work harder to develop the steel industry at the fastest speed.

Second, American aggressors bully us because our machinery is still too little. This requires us to work harder to develop the machinery manufacturing industry at the fastest speed.

Third, American aggressors often mock our country's poverty. Our people have doubled grain production this year and demand that we continue to work harder to increase grain production at the highest speed to answer them.

Fourth, American aggressors still hold the old China mentality, believing that the Chinese people are a disorganized mass and easy to bully. This requires our people to be further organized. Indeed, on the basis of socialist transformation, we have universally promoted the people's commune movement, further uniting the 600 million people as one.

Fifth, American aggressors bully us, which requires us to vigorously strengthen our national defense forces. We must not only have a strong regular army, but also vigorously develop militia divisions to achieve universal conscription.

Sixth, American aggressors bully us, which requires us to work harder to rapidly climb to the world's peak in cutting-edge science and technology.

Seventh, American aggressors insist on implementing a policy of blockade and embargo against our country, which promotes greater and faster results in our country's construction.

Eighth, the United States insists on a policy of hostility towards our country in the international arena, which constantly reminds our people and makes us good at distinguishing between friend and foe. Our friends are all over the world, while American imperialists have isolated themselves.

These are the lessons that the American aggressor, this negative teacher, has taught us.

From their own long-term struggle experiences, the Chinese people deeply understand the role of negative teachers. The masses of people often need to educate themselves with socialist and communist ideas, and to educate themselves by summing up experiences in struggle. At the same time, the enemy's use of various means to deal with the people is an important negative teaching material for raising the awareness of the masses.

Hitler, Mussolini, and Japanese imperialism were all the best negative teachers for the people of the world and the Chinese people. Their heinous acts of aggression mobilized the people of the world, resulting in the victory of the war against German and Italian fascism in Europe, and the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan in the East. The overall result was that socialist and national revolutions achieved victory in many countries in the East and West.

For the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek played the role of this negative teacher. His counter-revolution educated the people of the whole country, aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, and thus promoted the victory of the great Chinese people's revolution. Now he continues to play the role of a negative teacher for the Chinese people in Taiwan.

The Tito clique can also be called a very good negative teacher. With their typical revisionism, they educate the whole world, and the Chinese communists, making people clearly understand what is true socialism and what is false socialism; what is true Marxism and what is false Marxism.

American imperialism has inherited the mantle of all reactionaries in history and has become the "Number One" negative teacher for the people of the world and the Chinese people. He cultivates, subsidizes, and directs all the big and small reactionaries in the world, becoming the head of all the negative teachers in the world. American imperialism uses its policy of aggression and war as reactionary teaching material to educate the people of the world. In this way, the American aggressors have linked the struggle of the whole world against American imperialism into a common struggle. In this way, the American aggressors have created an increasingly powerful force to bury themselves.

    美国侵略者给我们充当反面教员
    “红旗”杂志评论员
    在中国人民的卧榻之旁，站着美国强盗，这就使每一个中国人不能不进一步觉悟起来，不能不在工作上紧张起来，以冲天干劲，增强国力，来有效地对付这个敌人。
    美国侵略者欺负我们，但是，却在各方面给我们充当了反面教员：
    第一，美国侵略者欺负我们，就是因为我们的钢铁还太少了，这就要求我们必须更加努力以最快速度发展钢铁工业。
    第二，美国侵略者欺负我们，就是因为我们的机器还太少了，这就要求我们必须更加努力以最快速度发展机械制造工业。
    第三，美国侵略者经常嘲笑我国贫穷。我国人民就在今年把粮食生产猛增一倍，并且要求我们更加继续努力以最高速度增产粮食来回答它。
    第四，美国侵略者还是抱着看待旧中国的观念，认为中国人是一盘散沙，是好欺负的。这就要求我国人民要更进一步地组织起来，而果然，我国人民就在社会主义改造的基础上普遍地推广了人民公社化运动，进一步地把六亿人民团结得像一个人一样。
    第五，美国侵略者欺负我们，这就要求我们必须大力增强我们的国防力量。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师，实现全民皆兵。
    第六，美国侵略者欺负我们，这就要求我们必须更加努力在尖端科学技术方面迅速攀登世界的高峰。
    第七，美国侵略者坚持对我国实行封锁禁运政策，这就促使我国的建设收到更大更快的效果。
    第八，美国在国际上坚持敌视我国的政策，这就经常地提醒我国人民，使我国人民善于分清敌我。我们的朋友遍于全世界，而美国帝国主义者恰好把自己孤立起来了。
    如此等等，就是美国侵略者这个反面教员给我们上的课程。
    中国人民从自己长期斗争的切身经验中，深深地懂得反面教员的作用。人民群众经常要用社会主义和共产主义的思想来教育自己，要在斗争中总结经验来教育自己。同时，敌人采用各种手段来对付人民，就是提高人民群众的觉悟的重要的反面教材。
    希特勒、墨索里尼和日本帝国主义者，都曾经是世界人民和中国人民的最好的反面教员。他们穷凶极恶的侵略行为，把全世界人民动员起来，结果在欧洲取得了反对德、意法西斯战争的胜利，在东方取得了抗日战争的胜利。总的结果，就是：社会主义革命和民族革命在东西方许多国家中取得了胜利。
    对于中国人民，蒋介石起了这种反面教员的作用。他的反革命，教育了全国人民，激起了中国人民的义愤，从而促进了伟大的中国人民革命的胜利。现在他在台湾还继续对于中国人民起着反面教员的作用。
    铁托集团也称得起是很好的反面教员。他们以自己的典型的修正主义，来教育全世界，和中国共产党人，使人们清楚地懂得了什么是真社会主义，什么是假社会主义；什么是真马克思主义，什么是假马克思主义。
    美帝国主义者继承了历史上一切反动派的衣钵，成了全世界人民和中国人民“天字第一号”的反面教员。他培植、接济和指挥全世界大大小小的反动派，成为全世界一切反面教员的头子。美帝国主义用他的侵略和战争政策，作为教育全世界人民的反动教材。这样，美国侵略者就把全世界反对美帝国主义的斗争连结成为共同的斗争。这样，美国侵略者就制造了一支日益强大的埋葬自己的力量。
