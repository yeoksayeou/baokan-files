    Born in Molten Iron
    Xindian Township, Mingshan, Sichuan

    Sichuan has an old Dragon Mountain,
    Thousands upon thousands of treasures in the mountain.
    Going into the mountain to seek treasure is easy,
    But returning is difficult, difficult, difficult.
      —Old Folk Song

    The County Party Secretary leads the team, heading towards the dark mass of Old Dragon Mountain,
    Taking a step and clearing away several clumps of thorns, hey! Treating them as conservative thoughts to be eradicated!
    The County Party Secretary leads the team, walking on the misty Old Dragon Mountain,
    Each foot kicking away the obstructing stones, hey! Treating them as superstitious viewpoints to be kicked away!
    The County Party Secretary leads the team, entering the glistening mountain hollow!
    Several punches kill a vicious wolf, hey! Just like dealing with the American imperialist aggressors!
    The County Party Secretary takes the lead, digging into the heart of Old Dragon,
    And that's how we got the iron ore, ha! That's how we got the iron and steel plant!
    The furnace fire ignited by our hearts, burning so vigorously!
    When the molten iron finally flows out of the furnace door, ha!
    Good news riding on red clouds...
    The molten iron is flowing, the sky is laughing, the mountain is roaring:
    Hahaha! Good, good, good!
    We, these local engineers, were born in molten iron!
