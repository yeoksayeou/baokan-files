Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 23rd: Hunan Province achieved a major victory in the high-yield steel and coal week from the 15th to the 21st.

During this week, the average daily output of pig iron in the province was 10,150 tons, the average daily output of steel was 2,099.83 tons, and the average daily output of raw coal was 200,000 tons. Both iron and coal exceeded the daily production plan target. Coal has already overfulfilled the October production plan.

During this week, high-yield red flags emerged everywhere. The Meitian People's Commune in Yizhang County launched the province's largest daily output satellite of more than 299,000 tons of raw coal on the 18th. Xinhua County, whose daily pig iron production has remained stable at a fairly high level since entering October, still led the province in daily pig iron production during the high-yield week. Xiangtan County has done a good job in repairing roads and organizing and managing the transportation army, so that there is no backlog of materials in the county, becoming an outstanding red flag in the province's transportation work. The technical barriers of indigenous steelmaking and indigenous ironmaking have been broken through by the steelmaking army throughout the province, and steel production has risen in a straight line.

The significant achievements in steel production in Hunan Province this week were achieved under unfavorable conditions such as continuous wind and rain, cold waves, and floods in some areas. The province's steelmaking army persisted in production in the wind and rain. The iron smelting furnaces of the Shaba Red Flag People's Commune in Sangzhi County were hit by mountain floods. One hundred and twenty-four iron smelting workers and cadres fought the floods. They repaired the flood control dam in three hours, and many people took off their clothes to wrap the furnace body and block the furnace mouth. As soon as the mountain flood receded, they immediately dried the furnace with firewood and continued production. With such tenacious fighting by the people of the county, the number of furnaces fired for ironmaking increased from the original 225 to 465. Under the unfavorable conditions of continuous wind and rain, various localities have rushed to repair a large number of factory buildings and rushed to transport a large number of raw materials and fuels, laying the foundation for the wintering, windproofing, and rainproofing of indigenous furnaces.

Currently, a technological innovation movement in steel production is unfolding throughout the province. The six million-strong steelmaking army is producing in a more organized and rhythmic manner than before, and has the experience and ability to fight persistently and achieve consistently high yields.

    湖南钢铁煤全面报捷
    据新华社长沙23日电　湖南省在15日到21日的钢铁煤高产周中，取得重大胜利。
    这一周，全省生铁平均日产一万零一百五十吨，钢平均日产二千零九十九点八三吨，原煤平均日产二十万吨。铁和煤都超过日产计划指标。煤已经超额完成10月份的产量计划。
    这一周中，高产红旗到处涌现。宜章县梅田人民公社，在18日放出了全省最大的日产原煤二十九万九千多吨的卫星。进入10月份以来生铁日产量一直稳定在相当高的水平上的新化县，高产周中的生铁日产量仍在全省领先。湘潭县由于大修道路，对运输大军组织管理的好，做到全县物资无积压，成为全省运输工作一面出色的红旗。土法炼钢和土铁炼钢的技术关，已被全省各地的钢铁大军突破，钢产量直线上升。
    湖南省这一周钢铁生产的重大成就，是在连日风雨、寒潮侵袭、部分地区还发生山洪的不利条件下取得的。全省钢铁大军在风雨交加中坚持生产。桑植县砂坝红旗人民公社的炼铁炉受到山洪冲击，一百二十四名炼铁工人和干部与洪水搏斗，在三小时内修好了防洪坝，很多人脱下身上的衣服包住炉身，堵住炉口，山洪一退，马上又用木柴烤干炉子，继续生产。全县人民这样顽强战斗，使开火炼铁的炉子由原来的二百二十五座增加到四百六十五座。在连日风雨的不利条件下，各地都抢修了大批厂房，抢运了大批原料和燃料，为土炉过冬、防风、防雨打下了基础。
    目前，一个钢铁生产的技术革新运动，正在全省展开。六百万钢铁大军比以前更有组织、更有节奏地进行生产，具备了持久作战、经常高产的经验和能力。
