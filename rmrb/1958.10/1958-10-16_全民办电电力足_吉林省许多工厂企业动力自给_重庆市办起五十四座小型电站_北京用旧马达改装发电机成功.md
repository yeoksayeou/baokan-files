Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 15th: Medium and small industrial enterprises in various parts of Jilin Province are vigorously carrying out electricity conservation and power generation campaigns. Many factories and enterprises have already achieved self-sufficiency in power (electricity).

The relevant leading authorities in Jilin Province, anticipating the objective trend of insufficient electricity, have vigorously mobilized factories and enterprises to conserve and generate electricity since September. Up to now, the three power supply areas of Changchun, Jilin, and Liaoyuan alone have resolved more than 7,000 kilowatts of various electricity (including converted power). Jilin City's factories and enterprises can increase their power by 40,000 to 50,000 kilowatts by the end of the year through self-generation. Jilin Fertilizer Plant put forward the slogan "Everyone should take action to utilize all energy sources," and vigorously engaged in steam, wind, and hydropower generation. A wind turbine installed on a granulation tower more than sixty meters high in the ammonium nitrate workshop has already started generating electricity. Employees of the Jilin Railway Bureau installed a turbine on a heating boiler to drive a motor to generate electricity, achieving a dual purpose (steam can still be sent into the heating pipes for heating after power generation), turning the steam heating room into a power plant. Employees of the Jilin Paper Mill used factory sewage as a driving force to generate electricity, with a power generation capacity of 1,500 kilowatt-hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th: A mass power generation campaign is unfolding in Chongqing. Up to now, the city has built 54 small power stations using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, with a total installed capacity of more than 1,600 kilowatts.

Those who built these power stations were ordinary workers, farmers, and grassroots cadres who knew little or nothing about the electricity industry. In rural suburbs, small power stations were generally built using hydropower, thermal power, and biogas. They made their own wooden water turbines, distribution boards, and pressure water pipes. The steelmaking and ironmaking workshops of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company had a large amount of hot water flowing out of their water pipes, and the employees used it to generate electricity; the employees of Beibei Glass Factory also successfully used a kind of high-heat gas from glass burning to generate electricity. A thermal power plant built by Chongqing University itself will be put into production in November. This power plant, which originally required more than 100 tons of steel to build, only used more than 30 tons of steel materials.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The Central Laboratory of the Beijing Electric Power Administration and the Repair and Assembly Plant of the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company modified old motors into self-excited induction generators to generate electricity, solving the problem of lighting electricity for their own units, and supporting industrial production with the saved electricity.

This new type of "power station" that has emerged in mass power generation only needs a prime mover (such as a car engine, a locomobile boiler, a gas engine, a diesel engine, etc.) to drive the motor and assemble a capacitor to generate electricity. Fuels can be biogas, charcoal, coal, gasoline, diesel, etc. Many organs and schools in the city have these equipments, so this method of power generation is extremely simple and easy to implement in the city.

The process of using motors to generate electricity in these two units is very simple. They used a car engine as a prime mover. As long as a belt loop is used, one end is installed on the motor and the other end is installed on a suspended tire behind the car. Starting the engine, the tire drives the motor to generate electricity for lighting. The electricity required for lighting in a three-story building of the Central Laboratory of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau is supplied by the electricity generated by a 10-kilowatt motor.

    全民办电电力足
    吉林省许多工厂企业动力自给
    重庆市办起五十四座小型电站
    北京用旧马达改装发电机成功
    据新华社长春15日电　吉林省各地中、小型工业企业，正在大力开展节电、办电运动。许多工厂、企业已经做到了动力（电力）自给。
    吉林省有关领导机关预计到电力不足的客观趋势，从9月份以来就大力发动各厂矿企业节电、办电。到目前为止，仅长春、吉林、辽源三个供电区就已解决各种电力（包括动力折合）七千多瓩。吉林市工厂企业到年底可以通过自己办电增加电力四万瓩到五万瓩。吉林肥料厂提出“人人动手，把一切能源都利用起来”的口号，大搞蒸汽、风力、水力发电。硝铵车间在六十多公尺高的造粒塔上安装的一个风力发电机，已经发出电来。吉林市铁路管理局职工将涡轮机安装在暖气锅炉上，带动电动机发电，做到一物两用（蒸汽发电后仍可送入暖气管路，供人取暖），蒸汽暖房变成了发电厂。吉林造纸厂职工利用工厂下水道废水作原动力发电，发电量达到一千五百度。
    据新华社重庆15日电　一个群众性的办电运动正在重庆市展开。到目前为止，全市已用土洋结合的办法建起五十四座小型发电站，总设备容量在一千六百瓩以上。
    办这些电站的都是不懂或很少懂得电业知识的普通工人、农民和基层干部，在郊区农村，一般利用水力、火力和沼气，建立小型电站。他们用木头自制水轮机、配电板和压力水管等设备。重庆钢铁公司炼钢、炼铁车间的水管流出大量热水，职工们利用它发出了电；北碚玻璃厂的职工也利用烧玻璃的一种高热汽体发电成功。重庆大学自建的一座火力发电厂，11月份就可以投入生产。本来需要一百多吨钢铁才能建成的这个发电厂，只用了三十多吨钢铁材料。
    新华社15日讯　北京电业管理局中心试验所和北京市汽车运输公司修配厂，用旧马达改装为自激感应发电机发出电力，解决了本单位照明用电的问题，把节约下来的电力支援了工业生产。
    这种在群众办电中出现的新型“发电站”，只要有原动力（如汽车引擎、锅驼机、煤汽机、柴油机等）来带动马达，装配一个电容器，就可以发出电力。燃料可以采用沼气、木炭、煤、汽油、柴油等。在城市里，许多机关、学校都有这些设备，因此这种发电方法在城市极其简便易行。
    这两个单位采用马达发电的过程很简单。他们利用汽车引擎作原动力，只要用一个皮带圈，一头装在马达上，另一头装在汽车后面一个悬空的轮胎上，开动引擎，轮胎牵动马达就能发出照明用的电力。北京电业局中心试验所一幢三层楼房所需的照明用电，是由一个十瓩的马达发出的电力供应的。
