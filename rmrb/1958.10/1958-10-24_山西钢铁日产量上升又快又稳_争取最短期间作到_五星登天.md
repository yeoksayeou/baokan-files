Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd. Shanxi Province has already achieved brilliant results in the steel production high-yield week from the 15th to the 21st. Now, all regions in the province are organizing new high-yield weeks or high-yield ten-day periods on this basis, striving to achieve "Five Stars Ascending to Heaven" in the shortest possible time, with overall bumper harvests in steel, iron, ore, coal, and coke.

During the week from the 15th to the 21st, the province produced a total of 67,088 tons of steel and 88,511 tons of iron. The average daily output of steel was 9,584 tons, and the average daily output of iron was 12,644 tons. Compared with the week from the 8th to the 14th, the average daily output of steel increased by 2.3 times, and the average daily output of iron increased by 2.25 times. The characteristics of the increase in steel production during this high-yield week were rapid, steady, and widespread. On the 15th, only Taiyuan and Changzhi cities had a steel output of over 1,000 tons; only five counties and cities had a steel output of over 1,000 tons. On the 21st, the cities and counties with an iron output of over 1,000 tons included Yu County, Yangquan, Changzhi, Yuci, and Taiyuan, among which Taiyuan City produced nearly 20,000 tons of steel in one day; there were sixteen counties and cities with an iron output of over 1,000 tons, among which Pingyao County produced 6,680 tons of iron in one day, setting a red flag in the province.

During the high-yield week, the development of various industries was driven by the implementation of "taking steel as the key link." In particular, the mining, coal mining, and coking industries developed more rapidly. On the 21st, the province's coal production reached more than 260,000 tons, and the output of coal mined by "small indigenous groups" has greatly exceeded that of state-owned large coal mines. Yuci Prefecture produced more than 20,000 tons of coke in one day, which is more than 20 times the daily coke production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company. The mining volume in various places generally exceeded the iron smelting output by one to several times. Great achievements have also been made in the production of refractory materials using indigenous methods, and transportation has also made great leaps forward.

Now, Shanxi is advancing victoriously, and local committees and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee have all re-arranged the tasks and measures for organizing high-yield weeks or high-yield ten-day periods starting from the 22nd. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to focus on coal mining and coking in the high-yield ten-day period from the 22nd to the end of the month, requiring the daily coal output to reach more than 50,000 tons and the daily iron output to remain above 3,700 tons. The Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held a district-wide telephone conference on the evening of the 22nd, which, in addition to deciding to achieve an average daily iron output of more than 10,000 tons in the high-yield ten-day period until the end of the month, also called for overall high yields in steel, iron, ore, coal, and coke. Taiyuan City, Changzhi Prefecture, Xinxian Prefecture, and Yanbei Prefecture have also made arrangements for continuing the high-yield movement. (Attached picture)

### 山西钢铁日产量上升又快又稳  争取最短期间作到“五星登天”

    山西钢铁日产量上升又快又稳
    争取最短期间作到“五星登天”
    新华社太原23日电　山西省在15日至21日的钢铁高产周里，已经取得了辉煌的战果。现在，全省各个地区正在这个基础上组织新的高产周或高产旬，争取在最短时间内使钢、铁、矿、煤、焦“五星登天”，全面丰产。
    在15日到21日这一周，全省共产钢六万七千零八十八吨，产铁八万八千五百一十一吨。平均每天产钢九千五百八十四吨，每天产铁一万二千六百四十四吨，同8日至14日的一周比较，钢的平均日产量增加了二点三倍，铁的平均日产量增加了二点二五倍。在这个高产周中，钢铁产量上升的特点是又快又稳又普遍。15日全省产钢千吨以上的只有太原、长治等两市；产钢千吨以上的只有五个县市。21日产铁千吨以上的即有盂县、阳泉、长治、榆次、太原等四市一县，其中太原市一天产钢近二万吨；产铁千吨以上的有十六个县市，其中平遥县一天产铁六千六百八十吨，在全省树立起了红旗。
    在高产周中，由于贯彻了“以钢为纲”，带动了各方面工业的发展。特别是采矿、采煤、炼焦工业，发展得更为迅速。21日全省煤产达到了二十六万多吨，其中“小土群”采煤的产量已大大超过了国营大煤矿。榆次专区一天炼焦二万多吨，超过了太原钢铁公司炼焦日产量的二十多倍。各地采矿量一般都超过炼铁产量的一倍至数倍，用土办法生产耐火材料也取得很大成绩，交通运输也有了飞跃的发展。
    现在，山西各地正在乘胜前进，各地委和太原市委都已重新安排了从22日起组织高产周或高产旬的任务和措施。中共晋南地委决定在22日至月底的高产旬中，要大抓采煤炼焦，煤的日产量要求达到五万吨以上，铁的日产量要求保持在三千七百吨以上。中共榆次地委在22日晚上召开了全区电话会议，除了决定在到月底的高产旬中平均达到日产铁万吨以上，还要钢、铁、矿、煤、焦全面高产。太原市、长治专区、忻县专区、雁北专区，也对继续开展高产运动作了部署。（附图片）
