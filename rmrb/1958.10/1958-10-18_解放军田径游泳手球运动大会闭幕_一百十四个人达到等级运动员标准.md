Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 17th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's 1958 Track and Field, Swimming, and Handball Games, which lasted for four days, closed on the 15th.

This congress achieved outstanding results. One hundred and fourteen people reached the standard of graded athletes, including five who reached the first-grade athlete level and seventy-two who reached the second-grade athlete level, an increase of more than 65% compared to the number of graded athletes before the games; two people broke the national record of 1 minute 13.7 seconds for the 100-meter sidestroke with times of 1 minute 10.5 seconds and 1 minute 13.1 seconds, respectively.

Of the 634 athletes who participated in the competition, 324 were soldiers from various companies. Xu Wangcai and Hu Wanhe, who broke the national record for the 100-meter sidestroke, are a private first class and a sergeant, respectively.

This sports meeting fully reflected the collectivist spirit and the glorious tradition of unity and friendship of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. After the Railway Corps team, which had relatively poor swimming skills, arrived, the Guangzhou Military Region team took the initiative to help them practice, which rapidly improved the swimming skills of the Railway Corps team.

The congress awarded nine banners to the Navy, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Fuzhou delegations, which won the top three places in the overall track and field, swimming, and handball scores, respectively, and awarded 107 medals to the athletes who won the top six places in each competition.

    新华社广州17日电　举行了四天的中国人民解放军1958年田径、游泳、手球运动大会，已在15日闭幕。
    这次大会获得了优异的成绩，有一百一十四人达到了等级运动员的标准，其中有五人达到了一级运动员，七十二人达到二级运动员，比会前等级运动员的人数增加了65％强；有两人分别以一分十秒五和一分十三秒一的成绩，打破了一分十三秒七的一百公尺侧泳全国纪录。
    这次前来参加比赛的六百三十四名运动员中，有三百二十四名是来自各连队的战士。打破一百公尺侧泳全国纪录的徐旺采和胡万何，一个是上等兵，一个是上士。
