Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The "Chinese Workers' Rally for the Struggle for Peace and Disarmament and Solidarity Week," jointly convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, was held in Beijing tonight.

The "Struggle for Peace and Disarmament and Solidarity Week" was initiated by European workers in June of this year under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions. From the 15th to the 22nd of this month, workers around the world will widely carry out various activities in this solidarity week to strive for peace and demand a halt to nuclear weapons testing.

More than 600 worker representatives from various industrial systems in the capital participated in tonight's rally. Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class has consistently carried out a resolute struggle for world peace. We warmly respond to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions and European workers; Chinese workers believe that peace is indivisible, and defending peace in Europe is defending peace in Asia, and defending world peace. The Chinese working class has always been concerned about the issue of peace in Europe and has given strong support to European brothers. As long as the people of all countries take action and the workers of the world unite, imperialist aggression can be completely defeated, and imperialist war conspiracies can be completely stopped.

Xu Zhizhen said that the military provocations of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in the Taiwan Strait area have aroused the anger of the 650 million Chinese people and their determination to fight the U.S. aggressors to the end. The people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and all peace-loving people in the world stand on the side of the Chinese people. As long as we strengthen unity and persist in the struggle to stop aggression and safeguard peace, victory will surely belong to us.

Xu Zhizhen finally called on all employees to take active action and strive to continuously enhance the strength to stop aggression and safeguard peace!

Duan Shoufu, a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, and Zhang Shuzhi, a worker from the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, spoke at the rally, expressing the Chinese workers' determination to stop wars of aggression and their firm will to defend peace. They said that workers all over the world are one family. Chinese workers are determined to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, unite closely with worker brothers all over the world and peace-loving people of all countries, and strive to defend world peace. Chinese workers firmly believe that the death of imperialism is getting closer and closer, and victory will always belong to the peace-loving people. They also warned the U.S. aggressors to immediately get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

The rally unanimously adopted a telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressing full support for the just struggle of European workers and resolving to work with workers around the world to stop aggression and defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The "Chinese Workers' Rally for the Struggle for Peace and Disarmament and Solidarity Week" sent a telegram to the World Federation of Trade Unions, expressing the Chinese workers' determination to resolutely stop aggression and defend peace. The full text of the telegram is as follows: To the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and forwarded to the trade unions and workers of European countries:

Under the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Struggle for Peace and Disarmament and Solidarity Week initiated by European workers, and the extensive activities carried out by workers and trade unions around the world during the Solidarity Week, demonstrate the growing strength of the international working class in the struggle to stop aggression and safeguard peace. World peace is indivisible, and Chinese workers and people fully support the just struggle of European workers. The unity and mutual support of workers in all countries is an important guarantee for winning victory in all just struggles. U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan and is carrying out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, which has aroused the unparalleled anger of the 650 million Chinese people and workers and people of all countries in the world. All U.S. aggressor troops must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. Chinese workers resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's use of West German atomic bases and the revival of West German militarism to threaten the peaceful lives of the people of Europe and the world. The U.S. aggressors themselves have forged the struggle of the whole world against U.S. imperialism into a common struggle, and the U.S. aggressors themselves have created an increasingly powerful force to bury themselves. Final victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people of the world.

    首都举行争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周大会
    中国工人制止侵略志坚如钢
    大会致电世界工联，表示全力支持欧洲工人的正义斗争
    新华社15日讯　中华全国总工会和北京市工会联合会联合召集的“中国工人争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周大会”，今晚在北京举行。
    “争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周”是在世界工联的号召下，由欧洲工人在今年6月间发起的。从本月15日到本月22日，全世界工人都将在这个团结周里广泛开展争取和平和要求停止核武器试验等各种活动。
    首都各产业系统的六百多名职工代表参加了今晚的大会。中华全国总工会副主席许之桢首先在会上讲话。他指出，中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导之下，一贯地为争取世界和平而进行坚决的斗争。我们热烈地响应世界工联和欧洲工人的号召；中国工人认为和平是不可分割的，保卫欧洲和平，就是保卫亚洲和平，也就是保卫世界和平。中国工人阶级历来关心欧洲和平问题，并且给予欧洲兄弟以有力的支持。只要各国人民行动起来，全世界工人团结起来，帝国主义的侵略完全可以被打败，帝国主义的战争阴谋完全可以被制止。
    许之桢说，美帝国主义侵略者在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅，已经激起了六亿五千万中国人民的愤怒和同美国侵略者斗争到底的决心，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都站在中国人民这一边，只要我们加强团结，坚持制止侵略、维护和平的斗争，胜利必然属于我们。
    许之桢最后还号召全体职工积极行动起来，为了不断地增强制止侵略、维护和平的力量而奋斗！
    石景山钢铁公司工人段守福、国营北京第三棉纺织厂工人张淑芝先后在大会上讲话，表达了中国工人制止侵略战争的决心和保卫和平的坚强意志。他们说，天下工人是一家。中国工人坚决高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，同全世界工人兄弟和各国爱好和平的人民紧密团结一起，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。中国工人坚信，帝国主义的死亡已经越来越近了，胜利永远属于爱好和平的人民。他们还警告美国侵略者必须立即从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去。
    大会最后一致通过致世界工联的电文，表示全力支援欧洲工人的正义斗争，决心同全世界工人一起制止侵略，保卫和平。
    新华社15日讯　“中国工人争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周大会”致电世界工联，表达中国工人坚决制止侵略和保卫和平的决心。电报全文如下：世界工联书记处转欧洲各国工会和工人们：
    在世界工联的号召之下，由欧洲工人发起的争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周，全世界工人和工会在团结周中所进行的广泛活动，显示了国际工人阶级在制止侵略、维护和平的斗争中日益壮大的力量。世界和平不可分割，中国工人和人民全力支援欧洲工人的正义斗争。世界各国工人的团结和相互支援，是一切正义斗争赢得胜利的重要保证。美帝国主义侵占了我国领土台湾并在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅，已激起了六亿五千万中国人民和世界各国工人和人民的无比愤怒。美国一切侵略军队必须从台湾和台湾海峡地区滚出去。中国工人坚决反对美帝国主义利用西德原子基地和复活西德军国主义来威胁欧洲和世界人民的和平生活。美国侵略者自己把全世界反对美帝国主义的斗争结成了共同的斗争，美国侵略者自己制造了一支日益强大的埋葬自己的力量。最后胜利一定属于爱好和平的世界人民。
