Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The increasingly intensified economic plunder of Latin American countries by U.S. monopoly capital has aroused widespread opposition from the people of Latin American countries.

    U.S. Dumps Surplus Agricultural Products on Latin America
    Argentine Newspaper Condemns U.S. for Shifting Economic Crisis
    The Argentine weekly "Qué" published an article entitled "Agricultural Surplus Products and the World Wheat Market," condemning the U.S. "surplus agricultural products" dumping policy, which has caused Argentina, a Latin American wheat-producing country, to experience increasingly deteriorating economic conditions in the past three years. It has become a real malignant tumor that devours the fruits of the Argentine people's labor and national savings.
    The article stated that the pressure exerted by the United States on other countries to step up the promotion of its "surplus agricultural products" has caused serious chaos in the international market and decisively led the agricultural product market to depression. The article pointed out that due to the U.S. "surplus agricultural products" dumping policy, Argentina's wheat exports in 1957 decreased by 24% compared to the period of 1935-1939, while U.S. sales almost increased tenfold, reaching 53 million tons, almost double the exports of all other wheat exporting countries in the world.
    The Argentine "Times" pointed out that the U.S. dumping of "surplus agricultural products" in Latin America has disrupted the traditional trade relations of these countries and severely damaged their economies.
    The newspaper pointed out that the economic crisis has led to a sharp increase in unsalable inventories in the United States, and the U.S. "surplus agricultural products" dumping policy is an attempt to shift the consequences of the economic crisis onto Latin American countries.

    U.S. Restricts Lead and Zinc Imports to Benefit Itself at the Expense of Others
  South American Countries Suffer Serious Economic Losses
    The U.S. government recently announced a 20% reduction in lead and zinc imports, citing the need to alleviate the "difficult situation" of domestic non-ferrous metal enterprises. This measure has seriously damaged the economies of some Latin American countries that rely on lead and zinc exports as an important source of income. The influential Peruvian newspaper "El Comercio" emphasized that the U.S. government's decision has "brought a serious blow" to the economies of Latin American countries, especially Peru. Peruvian Minister of Labor Ri E. Abarisio said that the measure will cause about 50,000 workers in Peru to lose their jobs. The president of the Mexican Mining Association, José Epilio, said that the Mexican mining industry was already in a state of crisis, and the U.S. import reduction will bankrupt many Mexican companies.
    According to the Uruguayan "Popular Newspaper," the Bolivian House of Representatives issued an official statement, angrily protesting the U.S.'s above-mentioned decision. The statement considered the U.S.'s measure to be "economic aggression against Bolivia." The House of Representatives suggested in the statement that the government find new sales markets for Bolivia's non-ferrous metals.

    Peruvian Magazine Points Out
    U.S. Gives Peru One Dollar, Peru Has to Pay Two Dollars
    The Peruvian magazine "1958" published an article fiercely criticizing U.S. economic plunder of Peru.
    The article stated when discussing U.S. "aid" to Peru, that this is "a noose around the neck of Peruvian producers, and this noose has already strangled them." The U.S. gives Peru one dollar, "and we have to pay two dollars." The magazine then wrote that the U.S. controls all sectors of Peruvian economic life. To illustrate this point, the magazine quoted a passage from a booklet published by the U.S. Embassy in Lima, "The Role of American Investment in the Peruvian Economy": "In recent years, the production of foreign enterprises (most of which are American enterprises) accounts for 35% to 40% of Peru's total output." The booklet also mentioned that among the long-term investments of foreign monopoly capital in Peru, 76% belong to the U.S., and 93% of short-term investments belong to the U.S.
    The magazine wrote: "Oil belongs to the Americans. Copper mines and most textile factories are also controlled by the Americans. The U.S. has a monopoly on cotton sales, coffee, zinc, and lead exports, and they control air transport, export machinery, etc."

    华尔街是拉丁美洲的毒瘤
    美国经济掠夺激起南美各国强烈反对
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国垄断资本日益加紧对拉丁美洲国家的经济掠夺，激起了拉丁美洲各国人民的广泛反对。
    美国向拉丁美洲倾销剩余农产品
    阿报斥美国转嫁经济危机
    阿根廷“什么”周刊以“农业剩余产品和小麦世界市场”为题发表文章，谴责美国“剩余农产品”倾销政策造成阿根廷这个拉丁美洲产麦国家最近三年内的经济情况日益恶化。它已经变成吞食阿根廷人民劳动成果和国家积蓄的一颗真正的毒瘤。
    文章说，美国为加紧推销其“剩余农产品”而对其它国家施加的压力，引起了国际市场的严重混乱，并决定性地使农产品市场趋向萧条。文章指出，由于美国的“剩余农产品”倾销政策，阿根廷1957年小麦的出口比1935—1939年期间下降了24％，而美国的销售却差不多增加到十倍，达到五千三百万吨，差不多比世界上其它所有小麦出口国家的出口多一倍。
    阿根廷“时报”指出，美国在拉丁美洲倾销“剩余农产品”，使这些国家的传统贸易关系遭到破坏，并且使它们的经济受到严重的伤害。
    这家报纸指出，经济危机使美国没有销路的存货急剧增加，美国“剩余农产品”倾销政策是企图把经济危机的后果转嫁到拉丁美洲国家的身上。
    美国损人利己限制铅锌进口
  南美国家经济遭到严重损失
    美国政府借口缓和国内有色金属企业的“困难处境”，最近宣布削减铅和锌的进口20％，这一项措施使一向以铅锌出口作为一项重要收入的一些拉丁美洲国家的经济受到严重损害。有影响的秘鲁报纸“商报”强调指出，美国政府的决定给拉丁美洲国家、特别是秘鲁的经济“带来严重打击”。秘鲁劳工部长里·埃·阿巴里修说，这项措施将使秘鲁约有五万工人失业。墨西哥矿业协会主席何塞·埃皮利奥说，墨西哥的采矿工业本来已处在危机状态，美国缩减进口将使墨西哥许多公司破产。
    据乌拉圭“人民报”报道，玻利维亚众议院发表了官方声明，愤怒抗议美国的上述决定。声明认为，美国的这种措施是“对玻利维亚进行经济侵略”。众议院在声明中建议政府为玻利维亚的有色金属寻找新的销售市场。
    秘鲁杂志指出
    美国给秘鲁一元　秘鲁得付出两元
    秘鲁杂志“1958年”发表文章猛烈抨击美国对秘鲁的经济掠夺。
    这篇文章谈到美国对秘鲁的“援助”时写道，这是“套在秘鲁生产者脖子上的绞索，这根绞索已经把他们勒死了”。美国给秘鲁一块美元，“我们就得付出两块美元”。杂志接着写道，美国控制着秘鲁经济生活的所有部门。为了说明这个问题，杂志摘引了美国驻利马大使馆出版的一本小册子“美国投资在秘鲁经济中的作用”的一段话：“最近几年来，外国企业（其中大部分是美国企业）的生产占秘鲁总产值的35％到40％”。这本小册子还提到，外国垄断资本在秘鲁的长期投资中有76％在短期投资中有93％属于美国。
    杂志写道：“石油属于美国人。铜矿和大多数纺织厂也掌握在美国人手里。美国对棉花收售、咖啡、锌和铅的出口拥有垄断权，他们掌握空运、出口机器等等。”
