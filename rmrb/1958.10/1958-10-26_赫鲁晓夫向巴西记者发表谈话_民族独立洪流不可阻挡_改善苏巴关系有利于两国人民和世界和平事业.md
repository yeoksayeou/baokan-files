Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 24th: According to TASS, Soviet Premier Khrushchev, in a recent meeting with Brazilian journalist Murilo Marroquim, stated that the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are an invincible movement of modern times. Colonialist and aggressive forces cannot stop this surging, irresistible tide.
	Khrushchev's remarks were published in the eleventh issue of "International Life" magazine.
	Khrushchev spoke to the journalist about the relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil. He said that the Soviet government can do its best to promote Brazil's industrial development. Agreements can be reached on the supply of machinery and equipment, sending Soviet experts to Brazil, and training Brazilian experts in the Soviet Union.
	Khrushchev pointed out that the lack of diplomatic relations makes it difficult to develop economic, trade, and cultural ties between the two countries. He said that the improvement and normalization of relations between our two countries benefits the peoples of both countries and the cause of world peace.
	Speaking of international issues, Khrushchev said that aggression in the Near East and aggression in the Far East are two links in the same chain, the direct result of Dulles' "brink of war" policy.
	Khrushchev said: The Soviet Union advocates establishing friendly relations between all countries, regardless of their social systems and national systems. We see no obstacles sufficient to hinder the development of the broadest comprehensive ties between socialist and capitalist countries. At the same time, we do not ignore the fact that there cannot but be disputes, differences of opinion, and conflicts of interest between socialist and capitalist countries. However, we believe that such differences and conflicts should not lead to war. Only political madmen and those courting death would think of using war as a means of resolving international disputes and differences of opinion. As for the ideological differences between capitalist and socialist countries, we believe that today, attempting to impose one's own beliefs on others by force is simply foolish.

    赫鲁晓夫向巴西记者发表谈话
    民族独立洪流不可阻挡
    改善苏巴关系有利于两国人民和世界和平事业
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫最近在接见巴西记者穆里洛·马罗基姆说，亚非人民和拉丁美洲人民的民族解放斗争是现代的不可战胜的运动。殖民主义和侵略势力阻挡不住这股汹涌澎湃的、不可战胜的洪流。
    赫鲁晓夫的谈话刊载在第十一期“国际生活”杂志上。
    赫鲁晓夫对这位记者谈到了苏联和巴西两国之间的关系问题。他说，苏联政府可以尽力促进巴西的工业发展。可以就供应机器和设备、往巴西派遣苏联专家、在苏联培养和训练巴西专家等问题达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，没有外交关系使两国的经济、贸易和文化联系难以得到发展。他说，我们两国关系的改善和正常化有利于我们两国人民，有利于世界和平事业。
    谈到国际问题的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，在近东的侵略和在远东的侵略是一个链条上的两个环节，是杜勒斯“战争边缘”政策的直接产物。
    赫鲁晓夫说：苏联主张在一切国家之间建立友好关系，不管它们的社会制度和国家制度如何，我们看不到有任何障碍足以阻挠社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间发展最广泛的全面联系。同时，我们也不忽视社会主义国家和资本主义国家之间不能不存在争端、意见不同和利益冲突这一点。但是，我们认为，这种分歧和冲突不应该导致战争。只有政治狂人和自找死亡的人才想把战争当作解决国际争端和意见分歧的手段。至于谈到资本主义国家和社会主义国家之间的意识形态上的分歧，我们认为，在今天企图用武力把自己的思想信仰强加给别人的做法简直是愚蠢的。
