    Taking the First Step – Reducing Royalties
    Qian Junrui
    The current royalty system for newspapers, periodicals, and books basically conforms to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." As one factor (but it should never be the primary one, let alone the only one), it generally plays a role in stimulating and promoting writing. At the same time, it generally takes into account that this system must ensure that authors and translators continue to work and never allow them to live off writing a single book for the rest of their lives.
    However, this royalty system is, after all, a reflection of bourgeois right. The vast disparity in royalty amounts is one aspect. The disparity between royalty standards (compensation for mental labor) and the income of workers and peasants (compensation for physical labor) is another aspect, and a more important one. These very prominently demonstrate the actual inequality between people, especially between mental and physical laborers.
    The situation in our country is developing rapidly. The current royalty system is clearly no longer suited to the current new situation, and if we look a little further ahead, it will be even more unsuited.
    What are some new circumstances related to this issue in our country?
    Social productive forces are developing rapidly, and the socialist and communist consciousness of the working class and peasantry is rapidly improving. People are not only building socialism with soaring enthusiasm, striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, but also preparing to transition to communism with boundless fervor. People are making the greatest efforts, adopting the best organizational forms and correct steps, to gradually eliminate the differences between industry and agriculture, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. The communization of the entire rural population has been basically completed, and the new distribution systems of semi-supply and supply systems are being rapidly promoted.
    A cultural revolution is vigorously unfolding throughout the country, and the worker-peasant masses are rapidly mastering culture and participating in the creation of new culture. The masses' poems and articles are as vast as the ocean. The number of submissions from workers, peasants, soldiers, and worker-peasant cadres, as well as mass-run newspapers and periodicals, is rapidly increasing to all newspapers and publishers. In our China, the era of a few intellectuals monopolizing the literary world is gone forever. It is clear that the purpose of the vast worker-peasant-soldier masses and worker-peasant cadres in writing poetry, articles, and summarizing experiences is definitely not to obtain a few cents of royalties, but to vigorously build socialism and communism. It can be asserted that this trend will become the mainstream of the writing community in our country. In addition, paying royalties to worker-peasant and worker-peasant cadre authors according to the current royalty system has adverse effects on the development of industrial and agricultural production and the raising of mass consciousness, and has increasingly aroused dissatisfaction and disgust among the worker-peasant masses.
    It should also be pointed out that the intellectuals in our country are undergoing profound changes. The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, as well as the nationwide comprehensive Great Leap Forward, have promoted the rapid progress of many intellectuals. Bourgeois individualism has suffered a devastating blow. The private ownership of mental labor products, inherent in and insisted upon by old intellectuals, has run into a wall in the face of socialism. In the minds of many intellectuals, this private ownership has already or is going bankrupt. A new type of intellectual is rapidly growing. Writing for royalties, "struggling for RMB," is clearly not their purpose. Their purpose in writing is for the construction of socialism and the realization of communism. On the other hand, after the rectification and anti-rightist campaign, the harm of high royalties to people's ideology has become increasingly apparent, and has been increasingly criticized and opposed by people.
    In response to the above situation, the current royalty system must undergo a fundamental reform, and the first step is to lower royalty standards. Without doing so, it will be completely impossible to adapt to the development of the current situation. Therefore, we fully agree with the method of lowering royalties proposed by the literary and art circles and publishing institutions in Shanghai and Beijing, and suggest that it be promoted throughout the country. Such measures are very beneficial for the further transformation of the ideology of intellectuals throughout the country, for the combination of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and for the prosperity and improvement of the publishing industry.

    先走第一步——降低稿费
    钱俊瑞
    现行的报刊图书的稿酬制度基本上是符合“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则的。作为一种因素（但决不应该是主要的，更不应该是唯一的因素），它一般地起着刺激和促进写作的作用。同时，一般地也注意到了，这个制度要保证著译者必须继续不断地劳动，决不容许靠写了一本书就可以吃一辈子。
    但是，这个稿酬制度毕竟是资产阶级法权形态的一种反映。稿酬本身高低悬殊，这是一个方面。稿酬（脑力劳动的报酬）标准和工人农民收入（体力劳动的报酬）的悬殊，这又是一个方面，而且是更加重要的一个方面。这些非常突出地表现人们，特别是脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间的实际上的不平等。
    我们国家的形势在一日千里地发展着。目前的稿酬制度显然已经不能适应当前的新形势，如果稍微看得远一点，那就更加不能适应了。
    在我们的国家里，有些什么有关这样一个问题的新情况呢？
    社会生产力迅速发展，工农劳动人民的社会主义和共产主义觉悟迅速提高，人们不仅在以冲天干劲，多快好省地建设社会主义，而且在以无限的热忱，准备过渡到共产主义。人们正在以最大的努力，采用最好的组织形式和正确的步骤，逐步地消灭工农业之间的差别、城乡差别和脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别。全国农村人民公社化已经基本上完成，半供给制和供给制的新的分配制度在迅速推广。
    文化革命在全国范围内蓬勃开展，工农群众迅速掌握文化，并且参与新文化的创造。群众诗文浩如烟海。各报刊各出版社从工农兵和工农干部方面的来稿以及群众自办的报刊急剧增加。在我们中国，由少数知识分子独占文坛的时代已经一去不复返了。很显然，广大工农兵和工农干部的写诗、写文章、总结经验，目的决不在于得到几文稿费，而是为着大搞社会主义和共产主义。可以断定，这种趋势必将成为我国著作界的主流。此外，按照目前的稿酬制度支付稿费给工农和工农干部作者，对发展工农业生产和提高群众觉悟都有不利的影响，并且已经日益引起工农群众的不满和嫌恶。
    还应该指出，我国的知识分子在经历着深刻的变化。整风反右派斗争和全国全面的大跃进，推动了许多知识分子迅速前进。资产阶级个人主义受到毁灭性的打击。旧知识分子所固有和坚持的脑力劳动产品的私有制，在社会主义的大关前面碰了壁。在许多知识分子的头脑里，这个私有制已经或者正在破产。新型的知识分子在迅速成长。为稿费而创作，“为人民币而奋斗”，显然不是他们的目的。他们写作的目的是为了社会主义的建成和共产主义的实现。另一方面，经过整风反右，高额稿酬对于人们思想意识的害处越来越明显了，也越来越遭到人们的非议和反对。
    针对着上述情况，目前的稿酬制度必须来个带根本性质的改革，而第一步就是降低稿酬标准。不这样办，就完全不能适应当前形势的发展。因此我们完全赞成上海和北京的文艺界和出版机关所倡议的降低稿酬的办法，并且建议全国各地推行。这样的措施对于全国知识分子思想的进一步改造，对于工农和知识分子的结合，对于出版事业的繁荣和提高都是十分有利的。
