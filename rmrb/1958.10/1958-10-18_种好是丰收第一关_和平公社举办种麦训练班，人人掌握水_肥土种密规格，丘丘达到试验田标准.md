Good Sowing is the First Step to a Bumper Harvest
Heping Commune Holds Wheat Sowing Training Class, Everyone Masters the Specifications for Water, Fertilizer, Soil, Sowing Density, and Each Plot Reaches the Standard of an Experimental Field

Nanjing, October 17th (Our Newspaper) – Heping People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, is vigorously carrying out field training classes, simultaneously grasping the five key factors for increasing production: water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, comprehensively improving the quality of autumn plowing and sowing. The three wheat fields generally achieve a deep plowing of more than 1.5 chi (about 50 cm), a base fertilizer application of more than 5,000 dan (about 250,000 kg), seeds passing through six checkpoints, a sowing rate of 50 jin (25 kg) per mu (0.067 hectares), a ridge width of 1 zhang (3.3 meters), and ditches forming a grid pattern. They have truly achieved garden-style cultivation and standardized technical quality specifications.

The Heping People's Commune's target for next year's yield of three wheats on more than 16,000 mu (1067 hectares) is 5,000 jin (2,500 kg) per mu. The Commune Party Committee accepted the lesson from last year's poor attention to the three wheats and put forward the leap forward targets and measures early this year. It adopted the method of field training classes, concentrating labor to vigorously develop high-yield experimental fields, and in the actual field operations, implemented various specifications and standards to cadres and the masses. At the beginning of October, the first training session concentrated 300 cadres, labor team leaders, and key militia members from the six brigades of the entire commune to build a high-yield embankment of 25 mu (1.67 hectares). They spent three days completing the entire set of technical operations from deep plowing the land, applying fertilizer in layers, treating seeds, to sowing. After these 300 people returned to their respective brigades, they became the backbone of the field training classes in each brigade. Subsequently, the commune concentrated more than 4,000 laborers for the second time, including cadres, Party members, Youth League members, and activists from various brigades, to vigorously develop high-yield experimental fields in conjunction with field training. Coupled with the field training in various brigades, nearly 10,000 people in the entire commune have been trained to learn the technical operating procedures for this year's wheat, so that everyone can state and implement the five major requirements and specifications proposed by the Party Committee regarding water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, and each plot of land reaches the standard of an experimental field.

The quality of autumn plowing and sowing in Heping People's Commune is even more refined than that of vegetable gardens. In the 20-mu (1.33 hectares) youth experimental embankment, more than 100 Youth League members and young men concentrated the 1-chi (33cm) deep layer of soil plowed on the ground into small mounds, smoking the soil by burning grass; then using ropes to pull machines for deep plowing 1 chi further down. This method of smoking the local soil to create fertilizer not only achieves the requirements of deep plowing, but also creates fertilizer, improves the soil, and kills various pests, achieving three benefits in one stroke. The soil turned up in the women's experimental field is piled up high, making it look less like plowing and more like dredging a river. Some people use a chaff cutter to chop straw on one side, and then turn the chopped straw into the bottom layer, and then apply river mud, smoked soil fertilizer and pig manure ash to the upper soil layer.

The Heping People's Commune adopted new methods such as smoking local soil to create fertilizer and returning rice straw to the fields, plus river mud, garbage, pig manure ash and various natural fertilizers. This year, the average base fertilizer application for the three wheat fields reached more than 5,000 dan (250,000 kg) per mu, and some experimental fields even exceeded this standard.

In the 25-mu (1.67 hectares) wheat high-yield experimental embankment of the First Brigade, wheat has already been sown, with a sowing rate of 50 jin (25 kg) per mu. The seeds have all gone through six checkpoints: wind selection, screening, salt water or muddy water selection, sun drying, drug seed mixing, and fertilizer-field powder seed mixing, and have undergone strict treatment. On the eve of sowing, the sowing experts selected by each brigade gathered together to study how to evenly sow 50 jin of wheat seeds in one mu of land, because their sowing rate last year was 18 jin to 20 jin, and even less in the past.

The Heping People's Commune is located in the low-lying area of ​​the Taihu Lake water network area. In order to completely solve the waterlogging problem, this year it changed the old rules of not opening ditches when sowing in the past. In the past, shallow ditches were opened when it rained, and ditches were opened every time it rained. This year, when plowing and sowing, the ditches are opened all at once, the ditches are half a person deep, forming a grid pattern, and the ridge head is one zhang (3.3 meters) wide, which also greatly improves land utilization.

In order to ensure that the late rice fields reach the standard of deep plowing and strictly abide by the seasonal "law", the Heping People's Commune has adopted the method of raising seedlings and transplanting for some late rice fields. The wheat seedling fields are also made very carefully. The First Brigade has a seedling field with wide ridges, straight ditches, and a layer of grass ash spread on the finely crushed soil, and the sown wheat seeds have grown tender yellow buds.

    种好是丰收第一关
    和平公社举办种麦训练班，人人掌握水
    肥土种密规格，丘丘达到试验田标准
    本报南京17日电　江苏省常熟县和平人民公社大搞田间训练班，水、肥、土、种、密五大增产关键从头一齐抓，全面提高了秋耕秋播的质量。三麦田普遍达到深耕一尺五以上，基肥五千担以上，种子经过六道关，播种量每亩五十斤，埨宽一丈，沟成井字形。真正做到了耕作园田化，技术质量规格化。
    和平人民公社一万六千多亩三麦明年亩产指标五千斤。社党委接受去年三麦抓头抓得不好的教训，今年及早提出了跃进指标和措施，并采取田间训练班的办法，集中劳力大搞丰产试验田，在田间实际操作中把各项规格标准贯彻到干部和群众中去。10月初第一次训练集中了全社六个大队三百个干部、劳动组长和基干民兵，搞了二十五亩大的一个丰产圩。他们用三天时间完成了从深翻土地、分层施肥、种子处理到播种的全套技术操作。这三百人回到各大队后，就成为各大队田间训练班的骨干。接着社里第二次又集中了四千多劳力，包括各大队的干部、党、团员和积极分子，结合田间训练大搞丰产试验田。加上各大队的田间训练，全社经过训练学会了今年小麦技术操作规程的达万人，使党委提出的关于水、肥、土、种、密等方面的五大要求和规格，人人都能说得出，做得来，丘丘田达到了试验田的标准。
    和平人民公社秋耕秋播质量比菜园还要做得精细。在二十亩大的青年试验圩里，一百多个共青团员和青年小伙子们，把地面耕翻起来的一尺深的土层，集中堆成一个个小土丘，烧草熏土；下面再用绳索牵引机深翻一尺。这种本田熏土造肥的方法，既能达到深耕的要求，又造了肥，改良了土壤，还烧死了各种害虫，一举三得。妇女试验田里翻起来的土，堆得高高的，简直不像是在耕地，而像是在开河。有人用铡刀在一边铡稻草，再把切碎的稻草翻在最下层，上面的土层里再施上河泥、熏土肥及猪灰。
    和平人民公社采用了本田熏土造肥和稻草还田等新办法，加上河泥、垃圾、猪灰及各种自然肥料，今年三麦田平均每亩基肥达到五千担以上，有些试验田还超过了这个标准。
    在一大队二十五亩大的小麦丰产试验圩里，麦子已经播下去了，每亩播种量是五十斤。种子都经过风选、筛选、盐水或泥水选、太阳晒、药剂拌种、肥田粉拌种等六道关，经过严格的处理。在播种的头天晚上，各大队推选出的播种能手就在一起研究，怎样才能把五十斤麦种均匀地播在一亩地里，因为他们去年的播种量是十八斤到二十斤，过去就播得更少了。
    和平人民公社地处太湖水网地带的低洼地区，为了彻底解决水涝问题，今年改变了过去播种时不开沟的陋规。过去是遇雨才开浅沟，下一次雨开一次沟。今年是翻地播种时一次把沟开好，沟有半人深，成井字形，埨头宽一丈，这样也大大提高了土地利用率。
    为了使晚稻田既要达到深耕标准，又要严格遵守季节“法律”，和平人民公社有一部分晚稻田采用育苗移栽的办法。小麦育苗田也做得非常精细。一大队有块育苗田，宽宽的埨头，笔直的沟，细碎的土垡上铺满了一层草木灰，播下的麦种已长出嫩黄色的幼芽。
