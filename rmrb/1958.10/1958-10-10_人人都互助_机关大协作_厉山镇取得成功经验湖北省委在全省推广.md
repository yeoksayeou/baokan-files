Everyone Helps Each Other, Government Agencies Cooperate Closely
Lishan Town Achieves Successful Experience, Hubei Provincial Party Committee Promotes It Throughout the Province

(This report from our reporter Tao JinYan) Hubei Province’s Sui County Lishan Town implements large-scale urban-rural cooperation, cooperation between various departments, cooperation between departments and residents, and cooperation between people within departments, thereby resolving various contradictions, leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production, and promoting the great leap forward in the work of various departments. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is currently summarizing the experience of Lishan Town and promoting it throughout the province.

Lishan Town has more than 6,000 people, with eleven units including supply and marketing, grain, banking, taxation, primary and secondary schools, culture and health, a farm tool cooperative factory, and three handicraft cooperatives. It is surrounded by seven townships and eighty-two agricultural cooperatives. The Lishan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party leads the work of the seven townships, and the Lishan Town Committee of the Chinese Communist Party leads the work of the town's various departments (various departments also have leadership relationships with the District Committee). In the past, they supported production and did a lot of work, but due to each emphasizing its own interests, the working relationship was not very coordinated, and conflicts often occurred between the district and the town and between departments. After the great leap forward in agricultural production, the average number of tasks in the district and town increased by 2.7 times compared with last year, but one-fifth of the cadres in the district and town were transferred to lower levels. With fewer people and more tasks, coupled with the uncoordinated relationships between the district and the town, between urban and rural areas, and between departments, both the District Committee and the Town Committee felt that the work was difficult to handle.

Once, at an on-site meeting, the County Committee commended the deeds of a agricultural loan officer: when he went to work in the countryside, he encountered torrential rain and floods submerged the bridge. After he completed his mission in the rain, he thought that transportation was inconvenient on rainy days, and other departments had difficulties in going to work in the countryside, so he took the initiative to help the post office bring back the letters from the township, and helped the tax office collect taxes. This agricultural loan officer's communist style deeply moved the District Committee and the Town Committee, and they began to have the idea of ​​cooperation. Then they heard the County Committee introduce the experience of the "Eight Hook-ups" in Qichun County and the experience of Macheng Songbu Town in supporting rural areas and implementing large-scale urban-rural cooperation, and they clearly realized that only by implementing cooperation between the district and town, between urban and rural areas, and between various departments, eliminating various contradictions, and mobilizing the positive factors of the masses can we do the work well.

After extensive airing of views and debates, the District Committee and the Town Committee resolved several issues of cooperation: 1. Thoroughly criticize the ideology of departmentalism; 2. Clarify that the purpose of cooperation is to support agricultural production (because only with the leap forward in agricultural production can the work of various departments make a leap forward); 3. Implement the unified leadership of the Party; the power of the District Committee and the Town Committee is used uniformly, and the entire district, from urban to rural areas, is uniformly divided into five fronts: industry, agriculture, finance and trade, culture, education and health, and residents' welfare, which are contracted by the District and Town Committees by front. The District Committee and the Town Committee regularly convene meetings of heads of various departments, and each department submits its work tasks, requirements, and practices to the meeting for research and discussion. After the District and Town Committees make comprehensive arrangements, they are uniformly deployed and jointly implemented, and reporting, inspection, and evaluation systems are stipulated to ensure the successful completion of tasks.

Subsequently, the District Committee and the Town Committee organized more than 100 agreements between departments, between systems, and even between streets. The two parties signing the agreements widely launched red flag competitions to compare cooperative spirit and to compare support for agricultural production. A comprehensive cooperation situation formed from the district to the town, and four forms of cooperation emerged successively:

(1) Urban-rural cooperation. Urban cadres and the masses support rural areas in terms of manpower, materials, and technology, providing whatever agricultural production needs. According to statistics, since the beginning of spring, the town has sent more than 1.7 million piculs of fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives, and has mobilized more than 20,000 laborers to support agricultural cooperatives in wheat harvesting, rice transplanting, drought resistance, and frost prevention. Various departments have organized a large number of technical personnel to go to the countryside to train nearly a thousand technicians for agricultural cooperatives.

Rural support for the town is no less impressive. When purchasing local specialties in a concentrated way, the quantity sold by agricultural cooperatives in three days increased by nearly two times compared with the total quantity purchased in the previous year. When the town was short of firewood, the township promptly delivered firewood to supply it. When the town was short of carpenters, the countryside also provided timely support. Agricultural cooperatives also often give priority to meeting the town's needs for vegetables and other non-staple foods.

(2) Departmental cooperation. Under the unified leadership of the District Committee and the Town Committee, when the town's departments carry out work, they have changed the past practice of "each sweeping the snow from their own door," and have carried out cooperation in business, supply and marketing, technology, and equipment. In order to solve the difficulty of various departments not being familiar with each other's business in cooperation, each department first printed relevant policies, guidelines, and technical issues into materials and distributed them to other departments. Through these materials, each department basically understood the business overview of other departments, and cooperation became very convenient. For example, after each department learned the knowledge of carrying out savings business, each department assisted the bank in establishing agency offices and developed more than 100 cooperative savings officers, which promoted the rapid growth of deposits in the town.

(3) Cooperation between people within departments. In response to the phenomenon of uneven busyness between business personnel and administrative personnel in various departments, human resources were uniformly arranged, replaced each other, and worked in a cross-cutting manner, so that the potential of people could be maximized. For example, after the finance office implemented cooperation between people, each person was both a tax collector, a finance officer, and a claims adjuster; the director, accountant, and statistics personnel of the bank all learned to be savings officers; when going out on business, they carried a savings bag with them and handled deposit business anytime and anywhere; after the post office implemented "five-member proficiency" (that is, everyone is a operator, a business person, a deliverer, a postal deliverer, and a cook), work efficiency was greatly improved.

(4) Cooperation between departments and residents. In order to leverage the role of idle social forces and realize the slogan of "no idle households on every street, no idle people in every household, everyone has something to do, and everyone has income" in the town, the District Committee and the Town Committee organized residents to establish 19 factories such as granular fertilizer, repair, fiber, leather, alum boiling, and noodle rolling. At the same time, they organized various departments to give play to the spirit of cooperation and provide strong support in terms of financial resources and materials. For example, when the three granular fertilizer factories were built, they encountered difficulties such as funds, factory buildings, and tools. The bank loaned nearly 40,000 yuan, and various departments supported 1,500 yuan in funds and vacated 20 rooms.

When departments and rural areas have urgent tasks, residents also organize forces to assist in completing them with all their strength. They have helped rural areas harvest wheat, resist drought, and prevent frost; during the early rice transplanting season, the grain management office urgently needed to send the grain seeds to the township, but there were insufficient manpower. Residents helped carry and transport them, and promptly sent more than 200,000 kilograms of rice to the farmers.

Organizing all-people cooperation in Lishan Town has not been smooth sailing. The process of realizing comprehensive cooperation in the town is also the process of struggle between collectivism and individualism. During the climax of the red flag competition to compete for cooperative spirit and to compete for support for agricultural production, some backward party branches, units, and individuals appeared in the town. They did not clearly understand the significance of cooperation, and thought that they would suffer losses if they cooperated with others, so they were not very enthusiastic about cooperation. The District Committee and the Town Committee paid great attention to strengthening the leadership of political and ideological work. For example, the branch of the joint venture and cooperative enterprises originally had resistance to cooperation and support for agricultural production. The District Committee and the Town Committee organized the branch to air their views and debate to eliminate the ideology of departmentalism. The branch actively led the town's joint venture and cooperative enterprises to cooperate with the bank, and assisted the finance office in achieving tax collection "three no's" and "five goods." During the wheat harvest, they also dispatched more than 400 people to help agricultural cooperatives harvest wheat, transplant rice, and resist drought; the agricultural cooperatives beat gongs and drums for this purpose and presented nine red flags to the branch to express their deep gratitude.

    人人都互助  机关大协作
    厉山镇取得成功经验湖北省委在全省推广
    本报讯　记者陶锦琰报道：湖北省随县厉山镇实行城乡大协作、各部门之间的协作、各部门与居民的协作、部门内部人与人的协作，从而解决了各种矛盾，发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，推动了农业生产大跃进，推动了各部门的工作大跃进。中共湖北省委正在总结厉山镇的经验在全省各地推广。
    厉山镇有六千多人口，有供销、粮食、银行、税务、中小学、文化卫生等十一个单位，有一个农具合作工厂，三个手工业社。它的周围有七个乡、八十二个农业社。中共厉山区委领导七个乡的工作，中共厉山镇委领导城镇各部门的工作（各部门和区委也有领导关系）。过去他们支援生产，做了不少的工作，但是，在区镇之间、部门之间，由于各自强调本身利益，工作关系不很协调，经常发生矛盾。农业生产大跃进后，区、镇各项任务平均比去年增加了二点七倍，区、镇干部却下放了五分之一。在人少事多的情况下，加上区、镇之间，城乡之间、部门之间的关系不协调，区委和镇委都感到工作不好办。
    有一次，县委在一个现场会议上表扬了一个农贷员的事迹：当他下乡工作时，正遇大雨滂沱，洪水淹没桥梁，他冒雨完成任务之后，想到雨天交通不便，别的部门下乡工作有困难，就主动帮助邮电所把乡里的信件带回，帮助税务所代收了税款。这个农贷员的共产主义风格，使区委和镇委深深受到感动，开始产生了协作的念头。接着他们又听到县委介绍圻春县“八挂钩”的经验，和麻城宋埠镇支援农村、实行城乡大协作的经验，才明确认识到只有区、镇之间、城乡之间、各部门之间实行协作，消除各种各样的矛盾，调动群众的积极因素，才能把工作做好。
    经过广泛的鸣放，辩论，区委和镇委解决了协作的几个问题：一、彻底批判了本位主义思想；二、明确协作的目的是支援农业生产（因为只有农业生产的跃进，各部门的工作才能跃进）；三、实行党的统一领导；区委和镇委的力量统一使用，全区从城镇到农村，统一分成工业、农业、财贸、文教卫生和居民福利五条战线，由区、镇委分战线包干。区委和镇委定期召集各部门负责人开会，由各部门将工作任务、要求、作法等提交会议研究、讨论，经过区、镇委会全面安排后，统一布置，共同执行，并且规定汇报、检查、评比制度，保证任务的圆满完成。
    接着区委和镇委组织部门之间、系统之间以至街道之间，签订了一百多份协议书，签订协议书的双方，广泛开展了比协作精神、比支援农业生产的红旗竞赛，从区到镇形成了一个全面大协作的局面，先后出现了四种协作形式：
    （一）城乡协作。城镇干部、群众从人力、物力、技术等方面支援农村，做到农业生产需要什么就给什么。据统计，入春以来，全镇已送往农业社一百七十多万担肥料，先后调动二万多个劳动力支援农业社的割麦、插秧、抗旱、防冻等。各部门组织了大批技术力量下乡，替农业社培养了近千名技术人员。
    农村对城镇的支援也不逊色。在突击收购土特产时，农业社三天中出售的数量就比去年全年收购数量增加近两倍。城镇缺少烧柴，乡里及时送木柴供应，镇上缺少木工，农村也及时给予支援；农业社还经常优先满足城镇蔬菜等副食品的需要。
    （二）部门协作。在区、镇委的统一领导下，全镇各部门进行工作时，改变了过去“各人自扫门前雪”的作法，进行了业务、供销、技术、设备等多方面的协作。为了解决各部门在协作当中不熟悉对方业务的困难，各部门首先把有关政策、方针、技术等问题印成材料，分发给其他部门，各部门通过这些材料，基本上通晓了其他部门的业务概貌，协作起来就非常方便。例如，各部门学会了开展储蓄业务的知识后，每个部门协助银行建立代办所，发展了一百多个协储员，促使全镇存款迅速增长。
    （三）部门内部人与人协作。各部门针对业务人员与行政人员忙闲不均的现象，统一安排人力，互相代替，交叉工作，使人的潜力得到最大限度的发挥。如财政所实行人与人协作后，每个人既是税收员又是财政员和理赔员；银行的主任、会计、统计人员等，每人都学会当储蓄员；有事外出，随身带着储蓄包，随时随地办理存款业务；邮电局实行“五员通”（即人人当话务员、业务员、投递员、邮运员和炊事员）后，工作效率大大提高。
    （四）部门与居民协作。为了发挥社会闲散力量的作用，使全镇实现“街街无闲户，户户无闲人，人人有事做，个个有收入”的口号，区委和镇委组织居民建立了颗粒肥料、修配、纤维、皮革、熬硝、轧面等十九个工厂，同时组织各部门发挥协作精神，拿出财力、物力大力支援。如三个颗粒肥料厂建厂时，遇到资金、厂房、工具等困难，银行就贷款近四万元，各部门支援了一千五百元资金、腾出二十间房屋。
    当部门和农村有紧迫任务时，居民们也都组织力量，全力以赴地协助完成。他们曾帮助农村割麦、抗旱和防冻；早稻下秧时节，粮管所急需把谷种送到乡里，但人力不足，居民帮忙挑的挑、运的运，及时把二十多万斤稻谷送到了农民手里。
    厉山镇组织全民大协作并不是一帆风顺的，全镇实现全面大协作的过程，也是集体主义和个人主义思想斗争的过程。在争比协作精神、争比支援农业生产的红旗竞赛高潮中，镇上曾经出现过一些落后的党支部、单位和个人。他们对于协作的意义认识不清，以为和别人协作，自己要吃亏，因而对协作不大积极。区委和镇委会十分注意加强政治思想工作的领导。例如合营、合作企业分支部原来对协作和支援农业生产有抵触思想，区、镇委组织分支部鸣放辩论，清除了本位 主义思想。分支部便积极领导全镇合营、合作企业和银行协作，并且协助财政所做到税收“三无”、“五好”。麦收期间，他们还抽调四百多人，帮助农业社割麦、插秧、抗旱；农业社为此敲锣打鼓，送上了九面红旗给分支部，向他们表示深切感谢。
