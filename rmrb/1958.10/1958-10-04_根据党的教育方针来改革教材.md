    Henan Province's agricultural and forestry education workers, under the leadership of the Rural Work Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, have carried out a thorough reform of the textbooks for agricultural and forestry schools. In just over five months, they compiled a complete set of teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks for higher, intermediate, and primary level agricultural and forestry schools. The newly compiled teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks embody the Party's education policy, greatly strengthening the textbooks' political and ideological content and their connection with production practice, especially with the production practice in Henan. The reform of agricultural and forestry school textbooks in Henan has taken another step forward in combining education with production, laying a good foundation for future teaching reforms.
    According to the Party Central Committee and the State Council's policy on education, carrying out a major reform of teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks is a pressing task in current educational work. All levels and types of schools are currently vigorously implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor. This is a profound educational revolution that is bound to cause a series of changes within the schools. Socialist education combines productive labor with theory and practice, and mental labor with physical labor; capitalist education separates from labor, theory from practice, and mental labor from physical labor. The two are completely opposed. After the new education policy begins to be implemented, the old things will inevitably be broken down, followed by the need to establish new teaching systems, teaching content, and teaching methods. Teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks must be thoroughly reformed according to the education policy. At present, China's industrial and agricultural production is advancing by leaps and bounds, rapidly changing the face of the country. This situation also forces school education to accelerate reform. This is most evident in agricultural schools at all levels. As everyone knows, this year, China's agricultural yield per unit area has increased several times to dozens of times, and "satellites" have appeared in various crops. This fact not only means that Chinese farmers have created a large amount of material wealth for the country, but also means new developments in science and technology in China's transformation of nature and improvement of crop cultivation. The original teaching content of agricultural schools at all levels in China is far behind the actual situation from the perspective of the great leap forward in agriculture. Farmers are planting high-yield rice with yields of tens of thousands of catties per mu, while the schools are still teaching six hundred catties or one thousand catties; wheat yields have reached seven thousand or eight thousand catties per mu, but textbooks still say it is a low-yield crop; the masses have many innovations and creations in crop cultivation, plant protection, soil improvement, fertilization, and irrigation, while the schools are still teaching the old ways. Many practical production problems, such as wheat and rice lodging and cotton boll shedding, have been solved by the masses in production, but the textbooks cannot explain them. All of this forces agricultural schools to carry out a series of reforms in teaching content, teaching organization, and teaching methods; otherwise, the students trained by agricultural schools will not be able to promote agricultural production or help farmers improve their scientific and technological level.
    The reform of teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks is an important part of educational reform. As everyone knows, teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks are the action program for teaching and the main basis for teachers to carry out teaching. Without a set of teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks that embody the Party's education policy and meet the needs of China's socialist construction and conform to China's reality in terms of political ideology and cultural and scientific knowledge, it is impossible to realize the political and ideological education of students and combine education with productive labor. Therefore, the reform of teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks is of great significance.
    So, how should textbooks be reformed? The textbook compilation work of Henan Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Schools has put forward many beneficial experiences. The most fundamental experience is that editing textbooks must proceed from the actual situation of the country and the province, combine with production practice, and resolutely overcome dogmatism. In the newly compiled textbooks, they not only greatly increased local materials and the masses' production experience in professional courses, but also increased materials closely related to production practice in general courses. This experience is very valuable, and it is the correct measure taken to address the main shortcomings in past textbooks. In the past, there were more or less dogmatic phenomena of detachment from politics, detachment from production, and detachment from China's reality in textbooks at all levels and types of schools. Some textbooks' content was either too light or too heavy, and some textbooks' content did not fit or did not fully fit China's reality, so even if students learned a lot of book knowledge, they could not apply it or could not use it in production practice. The newly compiled textbooks in Henan have basically overcome these shortcomings. The characteristic of agricultural schools is that they mainly train talents for the local area, and agricultural production also has great regional characteristics. There are great differences in natural conditions, economic foundations, crop varieties, and cultivation methods in various places, so it is completely appropriate to greatly increase local teaching materials in the curriculum. As for general schools or other schools, it is not necessarily required to have the same amount, but it must also be combined with China's specific reality and also be combined with the specific situation of the local area as much as possible.
    The reform of textbooks is a struggle to destroy bourgeois ideology and dogmatic thinking and establish the proletarian ideology of linking theory with practice. In the process of compiling textbooks in Henan Province, some people advocated that textbooks should only be compiled according to the blueprint of the old textbooks; otherwise, the systematicness and scientificness of the textbooks would be destroyed. Some people even said that only knowledge in books is knowledge. When some people were compiling crop textbooks, they were unwilling to adopt the advanced production experience created by the masses in China and the province and proven by practice, but insisted on copying materials from Japan, Britain, and other countries from books. In the eyes of these people, so-called systematicness and scientificness means copying and writing according to the original textbook arrangement system and according to the materials in the books. This is not systematicness or scientificness, but a blind faith in books and a blind faith in foreign countries. This so-called "systematicness" and "scientificness" must be greatly broken. It is completely correct to have systematicness and scientificness in editing textbooks. The arrangement system of some original textbooks cannot be completely negated, but more importantly, one should not copy blindly, but should proceed from specific objective conditions and subjective conditions, and there should be differences according to different subjects and different objects as to what should be abolished and what should be established. For example, in the past, the soil science course in secondary agricultural schools, the arrangement system of the textbooks has always been from the formation of soil to various soil classifications, and all kinds of soils, whether useful or useless, must be covered in all aspects. This is based on the history of soil formation as a system, and it is necessary to talk about this for those who specialize in soil; but for students of secondary agricultural technical schools, it is not necessary to talk about everything in such detail. We compile textbooks not for the sake of system or for the sake of knowledge, but to enable students to better understand and better apply what they have learned. Therefore, when compiling textbooks, not only should the materials be selected, but the structure system of the textbooks should also be considered. The newly compiled soil science textbooks in Henan have changed the arrangement system of the original textbooks, reorganized a new system, reduced some things that are irrelevant to China, and increased the geological history of Henan and the practical materials of deep plowing of land in Changge County and the transformation of upper seepage land and saline-alkali land in Neixiang and Xinxiang, and put soil science and soil classification at the end. Such a system is not from ancient to modern, from foreign to Chinese, but from Chinese to foreign, from modern to ancient; it has both theory and practice, and students are easy to accept. Isn't such a system better than the original textbook system?
    The method of compiling textbooks should also jump out of the old circle. In the past, the work of compiling textbooks was mostly concentrated in a few specialized agencies and a few experts in the central government, allowing them to work behind closed doors and single-handedly. These comrades also worked hard to compile many textbooks, but because the method was not correct and the strength was weak, the compilation of textbooks was always not satisfactory, and some textbooks could not even be compiled for a long time. This time, the textbook compilation work in Henan also reversed the routine, adopted the mass line working method, and mobilized the masses to compile textbooks. The people who participated in the compilation of textbooks were not experts, and the vast majority were young teachers who had never compiled textbooks. Their sources of information were not only large books and magazines, but also personally collected a lot of rich and vivid practical materials from the masses. They were not single-handed, but obtained the assistance of the masses and relevant departments. When they did not understand the problems, they asked the old farmers and relevant departments for advice, and discussed and studied with the masses. The masses provided materials, gave ideas, and directly and indirectly participated in the compilation of textbooks. This is the mass line working method, and it is also a method that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Education is the cause of the people, running education must follow the mass line, and compiling textbooks must also follow the mass line. We should combine the strength of the central government and the local governments, combine the strength of experts and the strength of the masses, so that experts and teachers can often contact reality, approach the masses, and often and timely summarize experience. Compiling textbooks should also take two legs, the central government compiles, the local governments compile, the experts compile, and the teachers and the masses also compile. In this regard, we must also break superstition, get rid of the idea of dependence, and do not think that compiling textbooks is mysterious and only specialized agencies can do it, do not just reach out to the higher levels, but should do it ourselves, rely on our own efforts. Henan Province can rely on its own strength to compile a complete set of textbooks, and other provinces will certainly be able to do it. The problem lies in putting politics in command, in strengthening the ideological leadership of this work by the Party Committee, and in following the mass line.
    Schools in various places have begun to try textbook reform. At present, many teachers and students of higher agricultural schools who have been sent to the countryside for labor training also plan to organize teachers and students to complete the work of adapting textbooks. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. We believe that on the basis of textbook reforms in various places, after analysis and research, and synthesizing the best things, we can compile textbooks that are universally applicable. We must thoroughly transform textbooks in the tide of the cultural revolution.

    根据党的教育方针来改革教材
    河南省农林业教育工作者，在中共河南省委农村工作部、省人民委员会农林厅的领导下，对于农林业学校的教材进行了一次彻底的改革。在短短五个多月的时间，新编了高、中、初三级农林业学校整套的教学计划、教学大纲和教材。新编的教学计划、大纲、教材体现了党的教育方针，教材的政治思想性、教材与生产实际特别是与河南的生产实际的联系大大加强了。河南农林业学校教材的改革，使教育和生产的结合又向前跨进了一步，给今后的教学改革打下一个良好的基础。
    根据党中央和国务院关于教育工作的方针，对教学计划、教学大纲、教材进行一次大改革，是目前教育工作中的迫切任务。各级各类学校目前正在大力贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。这是一个深刻的教育革命，它势必会引起学校内部一系列的变革。社会主义的教育结合生产劳动、理论联系实际、脑力劳动结合体力劳动；资本主义的教育脱离劳动，理论脱离实际，脑力劳动脱离体力劳动，两者是完全对立的。新的教育方针开始执行以后，旧的东西必然被破除，跟着就需要建立新的教学制度、教学内容、教学方法。教学计划、大纲、教材必须根据教育方针，彻底地加以改革。目前我国的工农业生产一日千里地前进，迅速地改变着国家的面貌。这种形势也迫使学校教育加速地进行改革。这在各级农业学校表现最为明显。尽人皆知，今年我国的农业单位面积产量几倍几十倍的增长，各种作物都出现了“卫星”。这一事实不仅意味着我国的农民为国家创造了大量的物质财富，而且意味着我国在改造自然、改进农作物耕作等方面科学技术的新发展。我国各级农业学校的原来的教学内容，从农业大跃进的形势来看，已经远远地落后于实际。农民种的高产水稻亩产量已经以万斤计了，而学校讲的还是六百斤、一千斤；小麦亩产量已达到七千、八千多斤，教课书中却还说它是低产作物；群众在作物栽培、植物保护、土壤的改良、施肥、灌溉等方面有许多革新、创造，而学校讲的仍然是旧的一套。许多生产的实际问题例如小麦、水稻倒伏、棉铃的脱落问题，群众在生产中已经解决了，而书本上却讲不出个所以然。凡此种种，都逼使农业学校不论在教学内容还是在教学组织、教学方法上进行一系列的改革，否则，农业学校培养出来的学生就不能促进农业生产，不能帮助农民提高科学技术水平。
    教学计划、大纲、教材的改革，是教育改革的重要内容。大家知道，教学计划、大纲、教材是进行教学的行动纲领，是教师进行教学的主要依据，如果没有一套体现党的教育方针的、没有一套在政治思想和文化科学知识方面符合于我国社会主义建设需要和符合于我国实际的教学计划、大纲、教材，就不能实现对于学生的政治思想教育，实现教育和生产劳动的结合。因此，教学计划、大纲、教材的改革是有重大意义的。
  那么，教材怎样进行改革呢？河南省农林业学校教材的编写工作提出了许多有益的经验。其中最根本的经验就是编辑教材必须从本国和本省的实际出发，和生产实际结合，坚决克服教条主义。他们在新编的教材中不仅在专业课方面大量增加了乡土材料和群众的生产经验，而且普通课也增加了与生产实际密切相关的材料。这条经验非常可贵，这是针对过去教材中的主要缺点所采取的正确措施。过去各级各类学校的教材中都或多或少的存在脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离我国实际的教条主义现象。有些教材的内容不是分量过轻就是分量过重，有些教材的内容不切合或不完全切合我国的实际，因而学生纵然学了一大堆书本知识，但到生产实际中，不是不会应用就是用不上。这次河南新编的教材就基本上克服了这些缺点。农业学校的特点是主要为本地培养人材，同时农业生产也有很大的地区性，各地自然条件、经济基础、作物品种、耕作方法等都有很大差异，因此课程中大量增加乡土教材是完全应该的。至于普通学校或其他学校不一定要求同等的分量，但是，也必须和我国的具体实际相结合，并且也尽可能地与本地的具体情况相结合。
    教材的改革是一个破资产阶级思想和教条主义思想，立无产阶级的理论联系实际思想的斗争。河南省在编写教材的过程中，有人就主张编教材只能照旧教材的蓝本去编，否则，就破坏了教材的系统性、科学性。有人甚至这样说，只有书本上的知识才是知识。有人在编写作物教材的时候，对我国以及该省群众创造的并且已被实践证明的先进生产经验，不肯采用，而偏偏从书本上去抄引日本、英国等国的材料。在这些人的眼里，所谓系统性、科学性就是按原有教材的编排系统，照书本上的材料照抄照写。这不是什么系统性、科学性，而是对书本的迷信，对于外国的迷信。这种所谓“系统性”、“科学性”是要大破特破的。编辑教材要有系统性、科学性，这是完全对的。对于原有的一些教材的编排系统不能一概否定，但更重要的是不能照葫芦画瓢，而应当从具体的客观情况和主观条件出发，何者该废，何者该立，根据不同的学科、不同的对象而有所差别。例如过去中等农业学校的土壤学这门课程，教材的编排系统一直都是从土壤的形成讲到各种各样的土壤分类，不管这些土类有用无用，都要面面俱到的去讲。这是以土壤形成的历史为系统来讲的，对专学土壤的人，有这一讲的必要；但对于中等农业技术学校的学生来说就不需要过细的样样都讲。我们编教材不是为系统而系统，为知识而知识，而是使学生学了以后能够更好的理解、更好的应用。因此，编写教材的时候，不仅材料应当有所选择，教材的结构系统也应当有所考虑。这次河南新编的土壤学教材就改变了原有教材的编排系统，另行组织了新的系统，削减了一些与我国无关的东西，增加了河南的地质史料以及长葛县深翻土地、内乡和新乡等地改造上浸地和盐碱地的实际材料，而把土壤学说、土壤的分类等放在最后去讲。这样的系统不是由古及今，由外国及中国，而是由中国及外国，由今及古；既有理论又有实际，学生容易接受。这样的系统比之原来的教材系统不是更好吗？
    编写教材的方法同样要跳出旧的圈子。过去，教材的编写工作大都集中在中央少数专门机关和少数专家身上，让他们关门闭户、单枪匹马的去干。这些同志也辛辛苦苦地编出了许多教材，但由于方法不对头，力量单薄，教材的编写总不合需要，有些教材甚至在长时间内编写不出来。这次河南教材的编写工作也一反常规，采取群众路线的工作方法，发动群众编写教材。参加编写教材的人员不是什么专家，绝大多数都是从未编过教材的年青教师。他们的资料来源不光是大宗的图书杂志，还亲自到群众中搜集了大量的丰富的活生生的实际材料。他们不是单枪匹马，而是取得了群众和有关部门的协助。他们不懂的问题就向老农、向有关部门请教，同群众一起座谈、一起研究。群众提供材料、出主意，直接间接参加了教材的编写工作。这是群众路线的工作方法，也是多快好省的方法。教育是人民的事业，办教育要走群众路线，编教材也要走群众路线。我们应当把中央和地方的力量结合起来，把专家的力量和群众的力量结合起来，要使专家和教师经常地接触实际、接近群众，并且经常地及时地总结经验。编教材也要两条腿走路，中央编，地方编，专家编，教师和群众也编。在这方面也要破除迷信，打掉依赖思想，不要以为编教材是神秘的，只有专门机关才能做，不要只伸手向上边要，而要自己动手，自力更生。河南省可以依靠自己的力量编写出一套完整的教材，其他省也一定能够做到。问题在于政治挂帅，在于党委加强这一工作的思想领导，在于走群众路线。
    各地学校已开始教材改革的尝试。现在不少下放农村劳动锻炼的高等农业学校的师生，也计划组织师生完成改编教材的工作。这是一个非常可喜的现象。我们相信，在各地教材改革的基础上，经过分析研究，综合最好的东西，就可以编出普遍适用的教材来。我们必须在文化革命的浪潮中，使教科书也彻底地翻身。
