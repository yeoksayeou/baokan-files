Dear Premier Kim Il-sung, Dear Chairman Choi Yong-kun, Dear Vice-Premier Kim Il, Dear Comrades and Friends:

The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to leave heroic Korea. During our two days in Pyongyang, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, the Supreme People's Assembly, the Government of the Republic, and the people of all circles in Pyongyang have received us with such warm hospitality and such grand farewells. This has once again made us deeply feel the flesh-and-blood affection of the Korean people for the Volunteers and the unparalleled warmth of the great socialist family. Here, allow me, on behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the heroic people of Pyongyang and, through you, to all the Korean people!

Dear Comrades: Tomorrow, October 25th, is the eighth anniversary of the Volunteers' entry into the war. We have spent a full eight years in Korea, from our arrival to our departure. Eight years is an extremely short fragment in the long history of mankind. However, these eight years of our common struggle are unforgettable. During this period, tremendous changes have taken place in heroic Korea, in our motherland, and even in the entire world. In these eight years, the Chinese and Korean people fought together to defeat the American aggressors and maintained peace in the Far East. These eight years were eight years in which the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people was unprecedentedly consolidated and developed through the irrigation of blood and sweat; eight years in which the heroic Korean people rebuilt a more magnificent and beautiful home from the ruins with their own laboring hands; and also eight years in which the East wind increasingly prevailed over the West wind throughout the world. In the past eight years, we have personally witnessed the heroic achievements of the Korean people in bravely defeating American aggression and diligently building a democratic base. Today, as we are about to bid farewell to the beloved Korean people and return to our motherland, we cannot help but feel infinitely reluctant at parting with our close comrades-in-arms. On the other hand, we are also infinitely excited about the great achievements the Korean people have made in these eight years. In these eight years of practice, we have deeply understood the truth that resisting America and aiding Korea means protecting our homes and defending our country, and we have understood the relationship of mutual assistance and interdependence between socialist countries. Imperialism touching one socialist country means touching the entire socialist camp, and the strengthening of the strength of any socialist country is the strengthening of the strength of the entire socialist camp. All our officers and soldiers are as excited and cheered by every achievement of the Korean people in building socialism and every piece of news about the Korean people striding forward on the Chollima horse as they are by the Great Leap Forward in our motherland. In these days before leaving Korea, the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers are particularly enthusiastically spreading the word and praising the new and great achievements of the heroic Korean people in various fields. For example, the great victory of agricultural collectivization and this year's bumper harvest of grain; the vigorous development of local industries since June, with output value leaping several times; the construction of the Haeju-Haseong inter-track wide-gauge railway by young socialist builders in seventy-five days; the completion of 20,000 residential units by the workers of Pyongyang with the materials and labor for the construction of 7,000 residential units; and the beautiful scene of the people's lives being improved day by day on the basis of the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production. We are excited to see that precisely because of this series of tremendous changes, the positive proposals put forward by the Labor Party and the Republic government for the peaceful reunification of the motherland are increasingly inspiring the struggle of the people in the southern half against the dark rule of the US-Syngman Rhee clique. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea now stands as a more powerful outpost of the socialist camp in the East. It proves to the world that the Korean people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and led by the Korean Workers' Party, have an invincible and great force.

Eight years ago, on "October 25th," the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea to participate in the war. At that time, our motherland had only been established for a year, and the wounds left by the long-term devastation of imperialism and domestic reactionaries had not yet been healed. The people who had been through decades of war had not yet had a rest, and the situation was extremely difficult. In the early stages of the Volunteers' entry into the war, they fought almost exclusively with machine guns, rifles, bayonets, and hand grenades against the number one imperialist army that occupied "air and sea superiority." However, despite this, because we were a volunteer army organized by the people liberated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fighting for justice and for peace, and with the support of socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world, we, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, after three years and one month of arduous war, finally defeated the American robbers who dominated the world and forced them to sign the armistice agreement and admit defeat. From then until now, it has only been a little over five years, but the American aggressors seem to have forgotten these lessons again. Not only do they refuse to leave South Korea and continue to instigate the Syngman Rhee clique to expand their army and prepare for war, obstructing the reunification of North and South Korea; but they also disregard the repeated warnings of our government and constantly carry out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region of our country. However, we must solemnly warn the aggressors that if they regard the patient actions of the Chinese and Korean people in seeking peace as a sign of weakness, then they are very wrong. If the American robbers insist on imposing war on the Chinese and Korean people, then they will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat, and a fate even more tragic than Shangganling and "Heartbreak Ridge" awaits them. It should be known that the Chinese People's Volunteers, at a time when imperialism is stirring up trouble in the Far East, resolutely and in accordance with the statements of the two governments, withdrew all of their troops from Korea according to the original plan, which not only once again demonstrated the sincerity of the Chinese and Korean people in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, but also proved even more that the Chinese and Korean people have the strength and confidence to safeguard the fruits of their struggle. Of course, the Chinese people's tremendous effort for peace in withdrawing their volunteers from Korea does not mean that the Chinese people have abandoned their internationalist obligations to their fraternal neighbor, the Korean people. After our withdrawal from Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers representatives remaining in the Korean Military Armistice Commission will continue to perform the task of supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement together with the Korean People's Army representatives. We firmly believe that whether it is a military fight or a verbal fight, imperialism is doomed to failure. Our just cause will surely win. The beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea over three thousand li will surely be unified, and our Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu will surely return to the embrace of the motherland. The giant of history will bear witness to us.

In the past eight years, we have personally seen and felt how heroic the Korean people are in war, how diligent they are in labor, and how optimistic they are in the face of hardship. The Korean people are the people who gave birth to heroes of the Republic such as Kim Chang-ryeol and Li Shou-fu, and the people who gave birth to internationalist fighters such as Ahn Ok-hee and Park Jae-geun. In front of such a people, what enemies cannot be defeated, and what difficulties cannot be overcome? The Korean people's style of being incomparably hateful to the enemy, brave and unyielding, and incomparably loving to friends, and selflessly dedicating themselves to others, is a unique common style of the people under the socialist system. And the Korean people, through the heroic and extraordinary struggle against American imperialism, and through the arduous and unremitting struggle for post-war recovery and construction, have made their own brilliant example in this regard. The Korean people, with their heroic deeds, have inspired the struggles of all the invaded and oppressed people, and inspired the construction enthusiasm of the people of socialist countries. In the eight years of getting along, the Korean people's spirit of patriotism and internationalism has given all officers and soldiers of the Volunteers an exceptionally vivid education. The people of our motherland have always been proud to have such a neighbor, and the Volunteers are even more honored to have fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and to be close comrades-in-arms of the Korean people.

Comrades, on the eve of our departure from Korea, being able to gather with you once again in this heroic city of Pyongyang fills us with feelings of nostalgia and excitement. Pyongyang, this heroic city that was bombed into ruins by the enemy and rebuilt, this city that persevered through the daily bombing during the war and has become more beautiful and magnificent, this city that is changing its face day by day with the famous "Pyongyang speed," has become a banner for the entire Korean people to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and a banner for the people of Eastern countries to resist aggression and maintain independence and freedom. On her, are recorded the bloody crimes of the American robbers; and on her, are written the magnificent epics of the Korean people. When we walk on Moranbong Hill and along the Taedong River today, we are not only deeply attracted by this picturesque landscape, but also feel infinitely excited by this unyielding heroic city. Pyongyang, together with the beautiful rivers and mountains of the entire Korea and the heroic people, will forever be engraved in our hearts. Here, in Pyongyang, the capital of Democratic Korea, we naturally think of our motherland's Beijing today, and we also easily recall Yan'an in the past. We will never forget that many Korean comrades were with us in Yan'an in those years, in various anti-Japanese base areas, and on the vast land of our country from the foot of Changbai Mountain to the coast of the South China Sea, sharing the days of battle. The Chinese people once won the liberation of the entire China starting from Yan'an. We firmly believe that the Korean people will also be able to start from this heroic city and finally win the peaceful reunification of the three thousand li of beautiful rivers and mountains. The wheels of history are moving forward in this way, and the victorious tomorrow is in front of us!

Tomorrow, we will set off from here and return home. Dear comrades, let us once again extend our heartfelt thanks and high respect to you here at the time of parting.

Let us shout:

Long live the heroic Korean people!

Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood and sweat!

Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    杨勇上将在平壤欢送志愿军大会上讲话
    朝鲜锦绣江山必将统一
    台澎金马一定重归祖国
    亲爱的金日成首相、亲爱的崔庸健委员长、亲爱的金一副首相、亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    中国人民志愿军总部，就要离开英雄的朝鲜了。我们经过平壤的这两天里，劳动党中央、最高人民会议、共和国政府、以及平壤市各界人民对我们如此热情的接待，如此隆重的欢送，使我们再一次深深地体会到了朝鲜人民对志愿军骨肉般的深情，体会到在社会主义阵营大家庭的无比温暖。在这里，让我代表中国人民志愿军全体同志，向英雄的平壤市人民并通过你们向全朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    亲爱的同志们：明天——10月25日，正是志愿军八年前出国参战的日子。我们从出国到回国，在朝鲜整整度过了八年时间。八年，在人类历史的漫长岁月里，是极其短暂的一个片断。但是，我们共同斗争的这八年，却是令人永远难忘的八年。在这期间里，无论是在英雄的朝鲜，在我们的祖国，以至在整个世界都起了巨大的变化。在这八年里，中朝人民曾在一起打败了美国侵略者，又在一起维护了远东的和平。这八年，是中朝人民的传统友谊在鲜血和汗水的灌溉中空前巩固发展起来的八年；是英雄的朝鲜人民用自己劳动的双手从废墟中重建起更雄伟、更美丽的家园的八年；同时，这八年也是在全世界范围内东风日益压倒西风的八年。八年来，我们亲身看到了朝鲜人民英勇战胜美国侵略、勤劳建设民主基地的种种英雄业迹。今天，当我们就要告别亲爱的朝鲜人民返回祖国的时候，一方面不能不有着同亲密战友分别时的无限依恋，另一方面，更为朝鲜人民在这八年中取得的伟大成就感到无限兴奋。我们在这八年实践中，深深地懂得了抗美援朝就是保家卫国的真理，懂得了社会主义各国互相援助唇齿相依的关系。帝国主义触动一个社会主义国家就是触动整个社会主义阵营，而任何一个社会主义国家的力量的增强，也就是整个社会主义阵营力量的增强。我们全军指战员，对朝鲜人民建设社会主义的每一个成就，对朝鲜人民跨上千里马，加鞭前进的每一个消息，都如同对待我们祖国大跃进一样兴奋欢呼。在就要离开朝鲜的这些日子里，志愿军的指战员特别热烈地奔走相告，互相传颂着英雄的朝鲜人民各方面新的巨大的成就。例如：农业合作化的伟大胜利和今年的粮食大丰收；今年6月以来，大办地方工业，产值跃进几倍；青年社会主义建设者以七十五天时间建成海州下圣间宽轨铁路；平壤市劳动者以建设七千户住宅的材料和劳动力完成两万户住宅的建设；以及人民生活在工农业生产飞速增长的基础上日益改善的美好情景。我们兴奋地看到，正是由于这一系列的巨大变化，劳动党和共和国政府为和平统一祖国提出的积极主张，正在越来越巨大地鼓舞着南半部人民反对美李黑暗统治的斗争。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国现在以更强大的姿态屹立在社会主义阵营的东方前哨，它向全世界证明，在马克思列宁主义武装起来的朝鲜劳动党领导下的朝鲜人民，有着不可战胜的巨大力量。
    八年前的“十·二五”，中国人民志愿军入朝参战。当时，我们的祖国建国才一年，而帝国主义和国内反动派长期蹂躏所留下的创伤还没有得到恢复，经过数十年战争的人民还没有得到休息，情况是异常困难的。志愿军出国初期，几乎只是用机关枪、步枪、刺刀和手榴弹和占有“海空优势”的头号帝国主义军队作战。但是，尽管这样，由于我们是在中国共产党领导下解放了的人民组织起来的志愿军，为正义而战，为和平而战，有社会主义各国及全世界爱好和平的人民的支援，我们同英雄的朝鲜人民军一起，经过三年零一个月艰苦卓绝的战争，终于把称霸世界的美国强盗打败了，逼使它在停战协定上签字认输。从那时到现在，只不过五年多时间，可是，美国侵略者似乎又忘记了这些教训，它不但赖在南朝鲜不走，继续唆使李承晚集团扩军备战，阻挠朝鲜的南北统一；而且无视我国政府的多次警告，不断在我国台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅。但是，我们要严正警告侵略者，如果把中朝人民谋求和平的耐心的行动，看作是示弱，那就大错特错了。美国强盗如果硬要把战争强加在中朝人民头上，那么，它必将遭到更可耻的失败，比上甘岭、“伤心岭”更惨的命运正在等待着它。要知道，中国人民志愿军在帝国主义正在远东兴风作浪的时候，毅然地遵照两国政府的声明，按原定计划全部撤出朝鲜，不但再一次表明了中朝人民对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，而且更证明了中朝人民有力量有信心维护自己斗争的成果。当然，中国人民把自己的志愿军撤出朝鲜这种对和平的巨大努力，并不意味着中国人民放弃了对兄弟般的邻邦——朝鲜人民的国际主义义务。在我们撤出朝鲜之后，留在朝鲜军事停战委员会内的中国人民志愿军代表，仍将同朝鲜人民军代表一道，继续执行监督朝鲜停战协定实施的任务。我们坚信，无论是武打，还是文打，帝国主义终究是死路一条。我们的正义事业必然胜利。朝鲜三千里锦绣江山必定统一，我国台、澎、金、马必定会重归祖国的怀抱。历史的巨人会给我们来作证的。
    八年来，我们亲身看到、感受到朝鲜人民在战争中是如此英勇，在劳动中是如此勤奋，在艰苦中是如此乐观。朝鲜人民是产生了金昌杰、李寿福这样的共和国英雄的人民，是产生了安玉姬、朴在根这样的国际主义战士的人民。在这样的人民面前，还能有什么战胜不了的敌人，还能有什么克服不了的困难。朝鲜人民这种对敌人无比仇恨，英勇不屈，对朋友无比热爱，舍己为人的风格，是社会主义制度下人民特有的共同风格。而朝鲜人民通过和美帝国主义的英勇非凡的斗争，通过战后恢复建设的艰苦卓绝的斗争，在这方面作出了自己的光辉的榜样。朝鲜人民以自己的英雄事迹，鼓舞了一切被侵略、被压迫人民的斗争，鼓舞了社会主义各国人民的建设热情。在八年的相处中，朝鲜人民的爱国主义和国际主义的精神使志愿军全体官兵受到异常生动的教育。我们祖国人民一直以有这样一个邻邦而感到骄傲，志愿军更以曾经与朝鲜人民军并肩奋斗，能作为朝鲜人民的亲密战友而感到无尚光荣。
    同志们，在我们撤离朝鲜的前夕，能在这英雄的城市——平壤同你们再一次欢聚，使我们充满留恋和兴奋的心情。平壤，这被敌人炸成一片废墟又重新建设起来的英雄城市，这从战争时期天天遭受轰炸的地下生活中坚持过来、又变得更加美丽雄伟的城市，这正在以著名的“平壤速度”日新月异地改变着自己面貌的城市，成了全朝鲜人民争取自己祖国和平统一的旗帜，成了东方各国人民反抗侵略、维护独立自由的旗帜。在她身上，记录了美国强盗血腥的罪行；在她身上，又写下了朝鲜人民壮丽的史诗。当我们今天漫步在牡丹峰上、大同江边的时候，不但为这如画似锦的江山所深深吸引，而且为这不屈的英雄城市而感到无限兴奋。平壤，将同整个朝鲜美丽的江山、英雄的人民一起，永远铭记在我们心里。在这里，在作为朝鲜民主首都的平壤，我们很自然地联想到我们祖国今天的北京，也容易想起过去的延安。我们永远不会忘记，许多朝鲜同志曾经和我们在一起，在当年的延安、在当年的各个抗日根据地，在从长白山麓到南海之滨的我国大地上，共同度过的战斗的日子。中国人民曾经从延安出发赢得了整个中国的解放。我们坚信，朝鲜人民也一定能从这英雄的城市出发，最后赢得三千里锦绣江山的和平统一。历史的车轮正是在这样前进着，胜利的明天就在我们前面！
    明天，我们就要从这里启程回国了。亲爱的同志们，让我们在这里再一次向你们致以临别的衷心感谢和崇高敬意。
    让我们高呼：
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    中朝两国人民以血汗凝成的友谊万古长青！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
