The rapid development of China's agriculture urgently requires agricultural economics scientists to serve the great leap forward in agriculture. The task of struggle requires us to unify our thinking. Agricultural work is carried out under the leadership of the Party and under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. However, in agricultural economic research and teaching, the struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology is extremely incomplete. The bourgeois white flag has not been completely removed, and the proletarian red flag has not yet been firmly established. After the whole people's rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, many people have politically chosen the path of socialism and expressed their obedience to the leadership of the Party. However, in the field of academic thought, there are still many people who cling to bourgeois ideas, adopting various disguises to continue spreading poison. There are quite a few people who eat socialist food but do capitalist things; they wear the signboard of socialist professors and smuggle bourgeois private goods onto the podium of socialist universities. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. In all corners of agricultural economic scientific work, white flags must be pulled out and red flags must be planted everywhere. We must bring agricultural economic research and teaching work into the orbit of the great leap forward in agricultural production and into the orbit of the general line of socialist construction.

    The Struggle Between Two Roads in Agricultural Economic Science

The struggle between two roads on the agricultural economic science front has been going on for a long time. In the stage of democratic revolution, our Party advocated using revolutionary methods to solve the peasants' land problem, while bourgeois scholars used various methods to help the ruling class rule and oppress the peasants, maintain the landlords, and oppose the revolution. In the stage of socialist revolution, on the issue of agricultural transformation, our Party advocated taking the socialist road, while bourgeois scholars opposed taking the socialist road. The struggle has been long, and the camps are very distinct.

First, let's talk about the revolutionary situation.

Old China's peasants suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, falling into poverty, hunger, bankruptcy, and extreme suffering. They strongly demanded revolution and the solution of the land problem. The Chinese national bourgeoisie did not put forward a thorough land program. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen put forward the slogan of "land to the tiller," he did not propose a way to realize this slogan. Only after the working class stepped onto the political stage and the Communist Party was established did the Communist Party formulate a thorough land program. Only the Chinese working class and its vanguard fought for the liberation of the peasants for a long time. Chinese peasants were liberated under the leadership of the Chinese working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. After the liberation of the Chinese peasants, they immediately carried out the socialist transformation of agriculture under the leadership of the Party. Our Party, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of continuous revolution, led the peasants from one victory to another. In China, the history of solving the peasants' land problem and the socialist transformation of agriculture is the history of the Communist Party leading the peasants in a victorious liberation struggle. The victorious revolutionary practice has yielded rich scientific and theoretical results, which are systematically and completely expressed in the documents of the Party Central Committee and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

In the stage of democratic revolution, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out from the beginning that the peasant problem was the fundamental problem of the Chinese revolution. In the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," Chairman Mao fully estimated the role of the Chinese peasants in the Chinese revolution and put forward the necessity of establishing peasant armed forces and rural political power in the countryside. Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the task of establishing and developing revolutionary base areas in the countryside, regarding this revolutionary base area as the main form of political, economic, and military alliance between Chinese workers and peasants, and as the starting point for the victory of the revolution throughout the country, using the revolutionary countryside to encircle the cities, thus achieving the victory of the revolution throughout the country. On the land issue, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong proposed adopting revolutionary methods to abolish the feudal exploitation of land ownership by the landlord class and implement peasant land ownership. According to China's characteristics, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong formulated a complete set of guidelines, policies, and steps for solving the peasants' land problem, so that land reform could be carried out in a guided, planned, and orderly manner, completing land reform nationwide in a relatively short period of time. In the land reform, the greatest creation of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong was to adopt the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, mobilizing the peasant masses from the bottom up, conducting a series of struggles against the landlord class through anti-hegemony, rent reduction, reasoning struggles, confiscation and distribution of land, and at the same time, adding the support of the state power from top to bottom, so that we could thoroughly eliminate feudalism without causing half-baked meals. The peasants changed from the status of land slaves to the masters of the land, which consolidated the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. Due to the great development of the masses' enthusiasm for production, the task of restoring the national economy was completed in a short period of time. In a large country like China, thoroughly eliminating the ancient feudal system and enabling 500 million peasants to obtain land is not only a world-shaking event in our country, but also an international event of great historical significance.

In the stage of socialist revolution, after the Party led the peasants to complete the land reform, it timely put forward the task of socialist transformation. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively solved the task of the peasants transitioning from individual ownership to collective ownership under China's specific conditions. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the two kinds of enthusiasm for collective production and individual production of peasants after the land reform, and the two kinds of possibilities for rural development. At this time, the peasants came to a crossroads. Should they take the socialist road or the capitalist road? The Party pointed out the task of leading the peasants to fight against the rich peasants and other capitalist elements in the new revolutionary stage. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that if socialism does not occupy the rural front, capitalism will occupy it. The only way to solve the problem of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads is to implement cooperation. The path of agricultural cooperation in China planned by Comrade Mao Zedong is the path of gradual transition. That is, from the mutual aid group of socialist buds to the semi-socialist primary society, and then to the completely socialist advanced society. This steady progress has brought great benefits to the smooth development of our cooperation. It enables us to avoid various losses that could be avoided due to sudden changes. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the class policy in the socialist transformation of agriculture: relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, establishing the leading advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperatives, and consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. In the cooperative movement, the Party emphasized the need to adopt the method of the mass line, that is, to guide the masses to voluntarily organize through persuasion education and typical demonstrations. Another characteristic of China's agricultural cooperation is that the three major transformations—the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, handicrafts, and agriculture—are mutually linked and coordinated, and the upsurge of socialist transformation in urban and rural areas promotes each other. Various socialist measures in the countryside are also coordinated with each other. While carrying out agricultural cooperation, the policy of unified purchase and sales is implemented to gradually bring agriculture into the orbit of the national planned economy; develop supply and marketing cooperatives to cut off the connection between urban and rural capitalism; develop credit cooperatives to restrict and eliminate rural usury. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," which enabled us to quickly complete the collectivization of agriculture. The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that under China's specific conditions, there must be cooperation first, and then large machines can be used, breaking the old concept that some comrades once believed that it is difficult to implement large-scale agricultural cooperation without agricultural mechanization, and pointing out the road for China's agricultural technology transformation to modernization. The collectivization of 500 million Chinese peasants in a short period of time is a great historical event both in China and internationally.

After completing agricultural cooperation and basically solving the problem of who will win in terms of ownership of the means of production, Comrade Mao Zedong promptly put forward the issue of further thoroughly solving the problem of who will win on the political and ideological fronts. According to this instruction, a nationwide rectification campaign and anti-rightist struggle were launched. On the basis of the ideological liberation of the whole people, a new upsurge in agricultural production was set off.

Due to the comprehensive and continuous leap forward in China's agricultural production and the increasing political consciousness of the 500 million peasants, the original agricultural production cooperatives with relatively small organizational scale, relatively simple business items, and relatively low degree of collectivity have been unable to meet the requirements of further development of productive forces. The Party Central Committee pointed out: "Under the current situation, the establishment of people's communes that comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs is the basic policy that must be adopted to guide the peasants to accelerate socialist construction, build socialism ahead of schedule, and gradually transition to communism." Under the advocacy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the movement to establish people's communes has gained rapid development.

Comrade Mao Zedong made an outstanding theoretical generalization of the rich experience of these struggles, which is a great contribution of our Party to the development of Marxism-Leninism and to the international communist movement.

Let's take a look at the counter-revolutionary situation.

While Chinese peasants were carrying out revolutionary struggles under the leadership of the Communist Party, the spokesmen of the Chinese reactionaries, the reactionary bourgeois economists, sang a duet with the Communist Party. They had many brands, but the common point was to help the landlord class oppress and exploit the peasants and oppose the revolution.

The Land Administration Society, which openly appeared in the guise of the Kuomintang reactionaries, spoke nakedly for the landlords. We said that landlords were supported by peasants, but these people said with a guilty conscience: "Those who have land do not cultivate, and those who have money do not work, which is beneficial to the poor people, otherwise, where can the poor hired peasants find food to eat?" They even wanted to draft a land law to consolidate the landlord's land system with laws.

Local warlords and landlord ruling factions also thought of many ways to attack the peasants and oppose the revolution. Liang Shuming, a retainer of Han Fuqu in Shandong, advocated "rural construction." What this gentleman was worried about was not imperialist aggression and feudal exploitation, but the peasants' desire for revolution. He advocated managing the peasants well and establishing rural order, which was actually the order of landlords exploiting peasants. Li Zongren of Guangxi advocated the civil corps system integrating politics, education, support, and health, and Peng Yuting and Bie Tingfang's so-called village governance in Henan were all tricks for landlords to rule and exploit the peasants.

Among the bourgeois agricultural economists, the more influential ones are the imperialist element Buck and his disciples in China, such as Yan Yangchu, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, and so on. Buck used to be a professor at Jinling University for more than 20 years, hiring a group of servants to conduct some false investigations in rural China, and wrote three reactionary works ("Chinese Farm Economy," "Chinese Land Utilization," and "Chinese Farm Management"), propagating the bourgeois "population theory," "the law of diminishing returns," "tenant superiority theory," "fair rent theory," etc., serving imperialist aggression against China, maintaining feudal rule, and opposing the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. After liberation, Buck's disciples and followers changed their identities and became experts and scholars, occupying many agricultural economics departments in schools, where they wreaked havoc. Of course, among this group of people, there were those who willingly served Buck wholeheartedly, and some who were indeed unclear about their understanding and have now repented, etc. But a group of people trained by Buck, all those who have not undergone thorough transformation, have played a bad role.

In the revolutionary struggles of the democratic revolution and socialist revolution stages, on the issue of peasants' land and agricultural transformation, the revolutionary people defeated all kinds of enemies. "Listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party's path." This is the conclusion reached by the Chinese peasants themselves.

    Class Nature and Objectivity

Now let's talk about some of the reactionary viewpoints spread by bourgeois agricultural economists among young people.

The first question is that bourgeois scholars sing the praises of objectivism. They say that agricultural economic science should be supra-class, supra-partisan, and supra-political, and that what they study is pure science, pure theory, and pure technology.

After discussion and exposure, it turns out that none of these people have ever been neutral in academic thought, and they have always served the reactionaries in the past.

So why are they pretending to be supra-class and supra-political now? Because these people do not dare to openly state their class and party positions, and attempt to use disguises to spread poison and harm the people. What they call "supra-class, supra-partisan, and supra-political" is completely deceptive.

In a class society, science, theory, and technology have never been neutral, and class views run through all fields of knowledge.

Some people say, what class nature does natural science itself have? Yes, but the scientists themselves have class nature, and they have class nature when explaining natural phenomena or using science and technology.

Social science itself is a science with strong class and party nature. Agricultural economics is a branch of social science. The object of study is the relations of production in rural areas, the relations between people in agricultural production, exchange, and distribution, and the countryside is a countryside with classes, so it cannot be separated from class relations and cannot be separated from class and party nature.

Some people say, what I am talking about is the management organization of socialist agricultural enterprises, and what I am talking about is accounting and statistics. What class nature is there in this? In fact, it is also inseparable from class nature, because there is a question of serving whom here.

Science, theory, and technology all have the question of who uses them and for whom they are used, and all have a class problem, a party problem, and a political problem. Marx made it very clear. He said that when the exploited and oppressed class has not been liberated, science is to help people carry out the liberation struggle. When they are liberated, science is to help them build. This is the real science. Chairman Mao also said: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with the class." In a class society, talking about supra-class, supra-partisan, and supra-political is itself a deception. There is no such thing in the world. On this issue, whether you like it or not, whether you are willing or not, since the society you are in is a class society, you cannot be separated from class, party, and politics. This is an objective law that does not depend on people's will.

Bourgeois scholars say that observing things becomes unobjective once they are stained with class and party. They put the objective attitude towards things in opposition to class and party nature.

The bourgeoisie is indeed opposed to an objective attitude. Because it wants to exploit workers and maintain its ruling position of exploiting workers, it must cover up the truth of exploitation and oppression of workers in many ways and conceal its reactionary position.

The working class and the vanguard of the working class are the most objective. The objective attitude towards things is completely consistent with the class and party nature of the working class. Because the working class is the most revolutionary class, it not only wants to liberate itself, but also to liberate all mankind. In order to promote the progress of world history, it needs to thoroughly understand the world. The soul of Marxist materialist dialectics is to make specific analysis of specific things. The working class does not need to conceal its class and party positions. The stronger its class nature and the stronger its party nature, the more truly it can reflect objective things.

Why do bourgeois economists want to put the so-called objective attitude in opposition to class and party nature? On the one hand, they dare not openly state their bourgeois position. On the other hand, they are unwilling to stand on the position of the proletariat and unwilling to abandon the bourgeois position. The essence of the problem lies here.

    The Party's Guidelines and Policies and Objective Laws

The second question is about objective laws and the Party's guidelines and policies. Bourgeois scholars have said thousands of words in the classroom, but they do not talk about the Communist Party's guidelines and policies. They believe that the Party's guidelines and policies do not reflect objective laws and have no scientific value; scientists who study agricultural economics should not follow the Party's guidelines and policies. On the contrary, the Party should act according to the "laws" studied by these so-called scientists.

Is it true that these people do not talk about guidelines and policies? No, they are talking about guidelines and policies, talking about Buck's set, the capitalist set. What they call not talking about guidelines and policies is not talking about the proletariat's guidelines and policies, not talking about the Communist Party's guidelines and policies.

What is a law? According to Chairman Mao, it is the internal connection of objective things, or the movement of the essential contradictions of objective things. We study laws and master laws in order to promote the development of things. The action plan formulated in accordance with objective laws is the Party's guidelines and policies. The task of scientific research is to do research work in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, to serve the Party's guidelines and policies, and to develop science in the process of service.

From the perspective of the entire liberation process of the Chinese people, because our Party has grasped the objective laws and stipulated the guidelines and policies in accordance with these objective laws, it has been able to promote the development of history.

Bourgeois economists do not have any "unwritten books" of laws. What they have is only a set of bourgeois, reactionary, fabricated, subjective, and fundamentally unscientific things that do not constitute laws. Whether it is from the entire issue of the Chinese revolution, or on the issue of peasants' land and agricultural cooperation, only the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have made the most profound, most specific, and most scientific analysis of the Chinese situation. The Party's guidelines and policies are formulated on the basis of scientific analysis of objective situations, scientific investigation and research, and summarizing the experience of mass struggles. The Party's guidelines and policies themselves are science and have great scientific value. In this regard, laws, science, and the Party's guidelines and policies are unified, not opposed. Therefore, to study the scientific laws in this area, it is necessary to study the Party's guidelines and policies. Without the Party's guidelines and policies, there is no science.

    The Great Leap Forward and the Stability, System, and Completeness of Science

The third question is that bourgeois scholars do not talk about the situation of the Great Leap Forward and do not introduce advanced experiences. They say: "Talking about the Great Leap Forward and advanced experiences will destroy the stability, system, and completeness of science."

Then, let's talk about the issue of "stability." Science is also developed in accordance with the laws of dialectics and has relative stability. But this stability is only relative and temporary, while its change and development are permanent and absolute. Everything is changing and developing. The task of science is to reflect this change and reflect this development. The change and development of things is the basis for the development of science. The reason why science can continue to develop is because objective things are constantly developing. Now China's socialist construction is in a great leap forward, our countryside has entered the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, and our science must well reflect this Great Leap Forward, stand at the forefront of this Great Leap Forward, and advance together with the Great Leap Forward.

Now is not the time to talk about "stability." The yield per unit area of grain in our country has exceeded 10,000 jin, 20,000 jin, and there are more than 50,000 jin. Large-scale high yields are all above 1,000 jin. Bourgeois scholars are still taking the old stuff of 500 jin to teach. Everyone is leaping forward, but they say, "Slow down, don't go, at least stabilize for two or three years!" Is its role to promote or to demote?

When we say this, these "scholars" will scare people again: "Great, we talk about the leap forward, but what if the system and completeness of science are destroyed?!" Don't be afraid. Let the system be broken. Let the completeness be broken. The more thoroughly it is broken, the better. If the old is not broken, the new will not stand. Break the old, smelly, and reactionary completeness and system to pieces, and new, revolutionary, complete, and systematic things will come out. This new, complete, and systematic thing will definitely come later, and the old one will be beyond reach. Lenin once criticized that the bourgeoisie always likes to talk about eternal laws. There are no eternal laws in the world. The so-called eternal laws are all fabricated.

The purpose of all those who talk about stability, system, and completeness is only one, that is, to maintain the old set, refuse to serve the general line of socialism, and refuse to serve the great leap forward in agriculture.

    "Population Theory" and Production Increase Issues

The fourth question is that at this meeting, the old roots of bourgeois economists were exposed, the so-called Malthusian population theory and the law of diminishing returns. They used this set as capital to spread nonsense against the great leap forward in agriculture and against the general line of socialism.

Why should this issue be raised? Because at this meeting, there are still individuals who do not quite understand the criticism of the population theory in their minds. Some people say: "Of course, it is wrong to talk about population theory, but it is ultimately a naturally existing law." Some people say: "If you think about it, it seems a little wrong, but if you think about it again, it seems that there are still some merits." Does the population theory have any merits, and is it science? Marx, Engels, and Lenin said a lot. Marx said: "Malthus is not a scientist, but just a hired advocate, a defender of the enemies of the British working class, and a shameless flatterer of the ruling class." "The conclusions made by Malthus are for the benefit of the general ruling classes, especially for the benefit of the reactionary elements in these ruling classes. In other words, he fabricated science for this benefit." All new and old Malthusian population theorists look at the population problem from the standpoint of the exploiting class, and attribute the poverty of the working people to the natural cause of too rapid population growth, thereby exonerating the exploiting class system.

Now the fallacy that has the greatest impact on young people is the so-called population growth in geometric progression, while the output of means of livelihood can only grow in arithmetic progression, and the growth of means of livelihood will never catch up with the rate of population growth. What is the truth? The great leap forward in agriculture in our country has completely shattered Malthus's population theory. The reality of socialist agricultural production in our country shows that the growth rate of means of livelihood far exceeds the rate of population growth. Our population may increase by a little more than 2% this year; but our summer grain harvest this year has increased by 69%, and the whole year may increase by 60%-90%. Which one is increasing slowly and which one is increasing fast?

But bourgeois scholars are unwilling to see and unwilling to listen to the facts of the great leap forward in agricultural production and the large increase in grain production in our country; even if they see and hear them, they still create various fallacies to oppose them.

Regarding the issue of large-area high yields, they said: "Small-area high yields are possible, but large-area high yields are not promising." Then please look at the facts: The average yield per mu of 6.13 million mu of early rice in Anhui Province is 1,003 jin. The average yield per mu of 4.62 million mu of early rice in Hubei Province is 1,033 jin. The average yield per mu of 2.6 million mu of early rice in Jiangsu Province is 1,014 jin. A yield of 1,000 jin per mu in the whole province is a big deal. In the face of such facts, do you still say that large-area high yields are impossible?

Can high yields be sustained? Some people say: "High yields this year may not be possible next year; high yields next year may not be possible the year after." Can high yields be sustained? Yes, it is certain. Last year, we only had more than 100,000 mu of wheat with 1,000 jin per mu, but this year we have more than 1 million mu. The area of 1,000 jin per mu in rice in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces alone is more than 8.7 million mu. The scope of large-area high yields is expanding year by year, which is a fact that no one can overturn.

So they finally came up with another point: "I don't deny the high-yield facts you said, but your high yield is not cost-effective!" High yields are not cost-effective, and not having high yields is cost-effective! A yield of 1,000 jin per mu is called "not cost-effective," while 100 jin is "cost-effective." What kind of theory is this? Bourgeois scholars, what you call "cost-effective" is from the perspective of capitalists exploiting workers. It is not cost-effective to exploit a few less, and it is cost-effective to exploit a few more. We are now engaged in socialism, and it is not the same thing at all! We have more than 100 million peasant households. Everyone is encouraged to work hard and produce thousands or tens of thousands of jin. Is this cost-effective? Or is it cost-effective for everyone to be idle and sit idle? The truth should be very clear.

Some scholars say that "more people, more consumption, less accumulation"; "more people is China's fatal wound, and the population problem is China's main problem." These are all absurd and strange theories. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his work report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "They only see that people are consumers, and more people consume more. They do not first see that people are producers, and more people can produce more and accumulate more." So we say that more people is a good thing, not a bad thing.

In the past, someone asked our Ministry of Agriculture, saying that the population is increasing so fast, what preparations do you have in the Ministry of Agriculture? We said that we are prepared. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the whole country are prepared for bumper harvests every year.

    The So-called "Method Is Advisable" and "Data Is Available"

The fifth question is the issue of research methods. On this issue, we are also opposed to bourgeois economists. Some people say: Buck's theory is reactionary, but the method is advisable and the data is available.

Whether the method is advisable depends first on what method it is. Buck's theory is consistent with his method. Buck's theory is reactionary, and the method is subjective and idealistic. His method is a metaphysical method that covers up the essence of classes, and it is a method that deceives the masses by concealing the truth in all aspects. The method we use is the method of materialist dialectics, the method of class analysis, and the method of the mass line. The so-called "the theory is reactionary, the method is advisable" is completely wrong.

Is the sentence "the data is available" correct? After everyone's discussion, there are also two views, called two different views of utilization.

One is the bourgeois scholar's view of utilization. They said: Science has continuity. If we don't use these materials, how can we catch up with the international level? This statement is wrong and reactionary. What we want to inherit is progressive and revolutionary, not reactionary. The so-called international level should be a progressive and revolutionary international level. Now the most advanced international level is socialism, and socialism has surpassed capitalism. If you really study, develop, and elaborate on the Chinese land reform issue, the socialist transformation issue, and the great leap forward in agriculture, this is the real international level. Trying to inherit Buck's things will only lead students to a dead end. This is a reactionary view of utilization.

There is also a revolutionary view of utilization. Buck's several books on agricultural economy, land use, and farm management are reactionary, but we do not burn them. We want to use them as a proof of the crimes of imperialist elements and reactionary ruling classes. On appropriate occasions, we will adopt a critical point of view and use them as negative teaching materials, so that people can see how those imperialist elements and reactionary economists attacked the peasants, distorted the truth, and spread poison in the past.

    Future Tasks

First, we must put politics in command and work in accordance with the Party's general line and the Party's guidelines and policies. Theoretical work must take the reality of class struggle and production struggle as its starting point, serve the construction of socialism, serve the great leap forward in agricultural production, serve the communization of people's communes, and serve the modernization of China's agriculture. And in the process of service, develop agricultural economic science.

Second, we must systematically study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Mao Zedong's thought is a living and creative Marxism-Leninism that combines the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. In the future, agricultural economic research and teaching work should take Mao Zedong's thought as the guiding principle. When studying Chairman Mao's works, we should also study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin; when studying these classic works, we should study Chairman Mao's method of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and we cannot separate the two.

Third, we must continue to criticize bourgeois ideas and revisionist ideas, and also overcome dogmatic ideas. In the field of agricultural economic science, we must not only solve the problem of the two roads of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but also solve the problem of the two methods.

Fourth, we must go deep into the countryside, go deep into reality, carry out labor training, transform our thinking, and combine with workers and peasants. Now we must resolve to go to the countryside and conduct investigations of the people's communes and the peasants' lives and production in the process of living and working with the peasants, so that theoretical research is closely integrated with reality.

Fifth, agricultural economics courses in all schools should take Chairman Mao's works and the documents of the Party Central Committee as the main teaching materials and the guiding ideology for compiling teaching materials. We must start writing textbooks on Chinese socialist agricultural economics. All regions must compile them, and adopt the method of everyone working together, combining leadership and the masses.

Sixth, we must resolve to establish a strong theoretical team of agricultural economic science that is both red and expert. We must vigorously train a group of worker-peasant backbones from the people's communes and rural work cadres, improve the existing proletarian theoretical cadres, and transform bourgeois intellectuals. We must advance on several fronts at the same time.

    资产阶级农业经济理论必须彻底批判
    刘瑞龙
    我国农业的飞跃发展迫切要求农业经济科学工作者为农业大跃进服务，斗争的任务要求我们必须统一思想。农业工作是在党的领导下，是在马克思列宁主义—毛泽东思想的指导下进行的。但是，在农业经济研究和教学工作中，兴无灭资的斗争极不彻底，资产阶级的白旗没有完全拔掉，无产阶级的红旗还没有巩固地树立起来。经过了全民整风和反右派斗争，很多人在政治上选择了社会主义的道路，表示服从党的领导。但是，在学术思想领域里，还有不少人死抱着资产阶级思想不放，采取各种伪装的办法，继续散布毒素。有不少人，吃社会主义的饭，作资本主义的事；顶着社会主义教授的招牌，在社会主义大学的讲台上偷运资产阶级的私货。这种情况，是不能让它继续下去的。在农业经济科学工作的所有角落，必须拔尽白旗，插遍红旗。把农业经济研究工作和教学工作，纳入农业生产大跃进的轨道，纳入社会主义建设总路线的轨道。
    农业经济科学上的
    两条道路的斗争
    农业经济科学战线上两条道路的斗争，很早就在进行着。在民主革命阶段，我们党主张用革命的办法来解决农民土地问题，资产阶级学者则用各种办法帮助统治阶级统治和压迫农民，维护地主，反对革命。在社会主义革命阶段、在农业改造问题上，我们党主张走社会主义道路，资产阶级学者反对走社会主义道路。斗争时间很长，营垒十分分明。
    首先谈谈革命方面的情况。
    旧中国农民身受帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的残酷压迫和剥削，陷于贫困、饥饿、破产，痛苦异常深重，强烈地要求革命，解决土地问题。中国民族资产阶级，没有提出一个彻底的土地纲领。孙中山先生虽然提出耕者有其田的口号，但是没有提出实现这个口号的办法。只是在工人阶级走上了政治舞台，共产党成立以后，才由共产党制定了彻底的土地纲领。只有中国工人阶级和她的先锋队，为了解放农民，进行了长期的斗争。中国农民是在中国工人阶级和她的先锋队——共产党领导之下获得解放的。中国农民解放以后，紧接着又在党领导下进行了农业的社会主义改造。我们的党按照毛泽东同志不断革命的思想，领导农民从一个胜利走向一个胜利。在中国，解决农民土地问题和农业社会主义改造的历史，就是共产党领导农民进行胜利的解放斗争的历史。胜利的革命实践，得出了丰富的科学理论的成果，它系统地、完整地表现在党中央的文献和毛泽东同志的著作中。
    在民主革命阶段，党和毛泽东同志一开始就指出农民问题是中国革命的根本问题。毛主席在“湖南农民运动考察报告”里面，充分地估计了中国农民在中国革命中的作用，提出了在农村中建立农民武装和农村政权的必要性。毛泽东同志提出在乡村中建立和发展革命根据地的任务，把这个革命根据地，作为中国工人和农民在政治上、经济上、军事上联盟的主要形式，作为革命在全国取得胜利的出发点，以革命的乡村包围城市，这样就取得了革命在全国的胜利。在土地问题上，党和毛泽东同志提出了采用革命的方法，来废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民土地所有制。按照中国的特点，党和毛泽东同志制定了一整套解决农民土地问题的方针、政策和步骤，使得土地改革能够有领导地、有计划地、有秩序地进行，以较短期间，在全国范围内，完成了土地改革。在土地改革中，党和毛泽东同志的最大创造，就是采取放手发动群众的方针，自下而上的发动农民群众，经过反霸、减租、说理斗争、没收和分配土地，对地主阶级进行一系列的斗争，同时加上国家政权自上而下的支持，这样，使得我们有可能彻底消灭封建，而不致于煮夹生饭。农民从土地奴隶的地位变成了土地的主人，这就巩固了人民民主专政的基础。由于群众的生产积极性大大发扬，就在短时间内完成了恢复国民经济的任务。在中国这样一个大国，把古老的封建制度彻底消灭，使得五亿农民获得土地，这不仅在我国是一个翻天复地的大事件，而且也是一个有伟大历史意义的国际事件。
    在社会主义革命阶段，党在领导农民完成了土地改革以后，及时地提出了社会主义改造任务。党和毛泽东同志创造性地解决了在中国具体条件下，农民从个体所有制过渡到集体所有制的任务。党中央和毛泽东同志分析了土地改革以后，农民集体生产和个体生产的两种积极性，农村发展的两种可能性。这个时候，农民走到了十字路口，究竟是走社会主义呢？还是走资本主义呢？党指出了在新的革命阶段，领导农民对富农以及其他资本主义因素进行斗争的任务。毛泽东同志指出，农村阵地社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领。我们要解决社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的问题，唯一办法就是实行合作化。毛泽东同志所规划的中国农业合作化的道路，就是逐步过渡的道路。即由社会主义萌芽的互助组到半社会主义的初级社，然后再到完全社会主义的高级社。这种稳步前进的办法给我们合作化的顺畅发展，带来了极大的好处。使我们避免了可以避免的由于突然变化而可能引起的种种损失。党中央和毛泽东同志提出了在农业社会主义改造中的阶级政策：依靠贫农和下中农，树立贫农和下中农在合作社内的领导优势，巩固地团结中农。在合作化运动中，党强调了要采用群众路线的方法，就是通过说服教育、典型示范的方法引导群众自愿的组织起来。中国农业合作化的另一个特点，就是三大改造——资本主义工商业、手工业和农业的社会主义改造是互相联系配合进行的，城乡社会主义改造的高潮互相促进。农村中各项社会主义措施也是互相配合的，在进行农业合作化的同时，实行统购统销政策，把农业逐步纳入国家计划经济的轨道；发展供销合作，斩断城乡资本主义的联系；发展信用合作，限制和消灭农村的高利贷。党和毛泽东同志提出“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，使我们能够迅速地完成农业的合作化。党和毛泽东同志指出，在我国具体条件下，必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器，打破了曾经有一些同志认为没有农业机械化，就很难实行大规模的农业合作化的旧观念，指明了我国农业技术改造走向现代化的道路。中国五亿农民短时期就实现了合作化，无论在中国，在国际上，都是一个有伟大历史意义的事件。
    在完成了农业合作化，基本上解决了生产资料所有制方面谁战胜谁的问题以后，毛泽东同志又及时地提出了进一步在政治战线、思想战线上彻底解决谁战胜谁的问题。根据这一指示，展开了全民整风和反右派斗争。在全民思想解放的基础上，掀起了新的农业生产高潮。
    由于我国农业生产全面的不断的跃进和五亿农民愈来愈高的政治觉悟，原有的组织规模比较狭小、经营项目比较单纯、集体程度比较低的农业生产合作社已经不能适应生产力进一步发展的要求。党中央指出：“在目前形势下，建立农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵互相结合的人民公社，是指导农民加速社会主义建设、提前建成社会主义并逐步过渡到共产主义所必须采取的基本方针。”经过党中央和毛主席的倡导，建立人民公社的运动获得了迅速的发展。
    对于这些斗争的丰富的经验，毛泽东同志作了卓越的理论的概括，这是我们党对于发展马列主义，对于国际共产主义运动的极大贡献。
    我们再来看一看反革命方面的情况。
    当中国农民在共产党领导下进行革命斗争的同时，中国反动派的代言人，反动的资产阶级经济学者，就和共产党唱对台戏。他们牌号很多，共同点是帮助地主阶级压迫剥削农民，反对革命。
    公开以国民党反动派的面目出现的有地政学会，他们是赤裸裸地替地主说话的。我们说地主是靠农民养活的，这些人昧着良心说：“有田者不耕，有钱者不劳，倒是对于贫民有利的，不然，贫雇农到哪里找饭吃？”他们甚至还要起草土地法，把地主的土地制度，用法律巩固起来。
    地方军阀、地主当权派，也想了许多进攻农民、反对革命的办法。山东韩复榘的食客梁漱溟主张“乡村建设”，这位先生所忧愁的不是帝国主义侵略和封建剥削而是农民要革命，他主张要把农民好好的管起来，建立乡村秩序，实际是地主剥削农民的秩序。广西李宗仁提倡政教养卫合一的民团制度，河南彭禹廷、别庭芳的所谓村治，这些都是地主统治农民、剥削农民的花样。
    在资产阶级农业经济学者中影响比较大的，要数帝国主义分子卜凯及其在中国的门徒晏阳初、费孝通、吴景超等等。卜凯过去曾经在金陵大学当过二十多年教授，雇佣了一批仆从，在中国农村进行了一些虚假的调查，写了三本反动的著作（中国农家经济、中国土地利用、中国农场管理学），宣传资产阶级的“人口论”、“土地报酬递减率”、“佃农优越论”、“公允地租论”等等，为帝国主义侵略中国服务，维护封建统治，反对中国人民的革命斗争。解放后，卜凯的门徒和跟班们摇身一变，成了专家、学者，占领了许多学校的农业经济系，在那里兴妖作怪。当然这一批人里边，有甘心五体投地为卜凯服务的，也有些人确实认识不清，现在已经悔悟了的，等等不一。但是卜凯所训练的一批人，现在凡是没有经过彻底改造的，都起了坏作用。
    我们党在民主革命和社会主义革命两个阶段的革命斗争中，在农民土地问题、农业改造问题上，革命的人民击败了形形色色的敌人。“听毛主席的话，走共产党的路”，这就是中国农民自己作出的结论。
    阶级性和客观性
    现在谈谈资产阶级农业经济学者在青年中间散布的若干反动论点。
    第一个问题，资产阶级学者高唱客观主义。他们说农业经济科学应该是超阶级、超党派、超政治的，他们研究的是纯科学、纯理论、纯技术。
    经过讨论、揭发，原来这批人在学术思想上，从来没有一个是中立的，他们过去一直是为反动派服务的。
    那么现在他们为什么装出超阶级、超政治的姿态呢？因为这些人不敢公开他们的阶级立场和党派立场，企图利用伪装，散布毒素，毒害人民。他们所说的“超阶级、超党派、超政治”，完全是欺人之谈。
    在阶级社会里，科学、理论、技术从来就不是中立的，阶级观点贯穿着一切知识的领域。
    有人说，自然科学本身有什么阶级性呀？是的，但是科学家本身是有阶级性的，他在解释自然现象或使用科学技术的时候，是有阶级性的。
    社会科学本身就是阶级性、党派性很强的科学，农业经济学是社会科学的一个分支，研究的对象是农村的生产关系，农业的生产、交换、分配中人和人的关系，而农村又是一个有阶级的农村，因此就脱离不了阶级关系，脱离不开阶级性、党派性。
    有人说，我讲的是社会主义农业企业的经营组织，讲的是会计、统计，这中间有什么阶级性呢？其实，这里也离不开阶级性，因为这里都有一个为谁服务的问题。
    科学、理论、技术这一切都有一个谁来用和为谁用的问题，都有一个阶级问题、党派问题和政治问题。马克思讲的很清楚，他说当被剥削被压迫的阶级还没有解放的时候，科学就是要帮助人们进行解放斗争，当他们解放以后，科学就是要帮助他们建设，这才是真正的科学。毛主席也讲过：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”在阶级社会里，大谈什么超阶级、超党派、超政治，本身就是欺骗。世界上根本没有这种东西。在这个问题上，不管你喜欢不喜欢，愿意不愿意，你所处的社会既然是个阶级社会，你就离不开阶级、党派和政治，这倒是一条不折不扣的不依照人们意志为转移的客观规律。
    资产阶级学者说，观察事物，一沾上阶级、党派就不客观了。他们把对事物的客观态度和阶级性、党派性对立起来。
    资产阶级确实是和客观态度相对立的。因为他要剥削工人，要维持剥削工人的统治地位，就要多方面掩盖剥削和压迫工人的真相，隐蔽自己的反动立场。
    工人阶级和工人阶级的先锋队则是最客观的，对待事物的客观态度和工人阶级的阶级性、党派性是完全一致的。因为工人阶级是最革命的阶级，他不仅要解放自己，还要解放全人类。为了推动世界历史的前进，它需要彻底的了解世界。马克思主义唯物辩证法的灵魂就是对具体事物做具体分析。工人阶级不需要隐蔽自己的阶级立场和党派立场。它的阶级性愈强，党派性愈强，它就愈能够真实地反映客观事物。
    资产阶级经济学者为什么要把所谓客观态度和阶级性、党派性对立起来呢？一方面，他们不敢公开自己的资产阶级立场，另一方面，他们不愿意站在无产阶级的立场上，不愿意放弃资产阶级立场，问题的实质就在这里。
  党的方针政策和客观规律
    第二个问题，关于客观规律和党的方针政策问题。资产阶级学者在课堂上讲了千言万语，就是不讲共产党的方针政策。他们认为党的方针政策是不反映客观规律的，是没有科学价值的；研究农业经济的科学家不应该跟着党的方针政策走，相反，党要按着他们这批所谓科学家所研究的“规律”来行事。
    是不是这些人当真不讲方针政策呢？不是的，他们在大讲方针政策，讲的是卜凯的那一套，资本主义的那一套。他们所谓不讲方针政策，是不讲无产阶级的方针政策，不讲共产党的方针政策。
    什么东西叫规律？按毛主席的说法是客观事物的内部联系，或者说是客观事物本质矛盾的运动。我们研究规律，掌握规律，是为了推动事物的发展。按照客观规律所制定的行动计划，就是我们党的方针政策。科学研究的任务就是按照党的方针政策去做研究工作，为党的方针政策服务，而在服务中发展科学。
    从中国人民整个解放过程来讲，因为我们党掌握了客观规律，按照这个客观规律规定了方针政策，因此就能够推动历史的发展。
    资产阶级的经济学者并没有什么“无字天书”的规律，有的只是一套资产阶级的、反动的、臆造的、主观的、根本不成其为规律的臭东西。无论从中国革命的整个问题来讲，或是在农民土地问题、农业合作化问题上，对中国情况作了最深刻、最具体、最科学的分析的只有共产党和毛泽东同志。我们党的方针政策，是根据对客观情况的科学分析，根据科学的调查研究，在总结群众斗争经验的基础上制定出来的。党的方针政策本身就是科学，有极大的科学价值，在这方面，规律、科学与党的方针政策是统一的，而不是对立的。因此，要研究这方面的科学规律，就必须研究党的方针政策，离开了党的方针政策，就谈不上科学。
  大跃进和科学的稳定性、
    系统性、完整性
    第三个问题，资产阶级学者不讲大跃进的情况，不介绍先进经验。他们说：“一讲大跃进和先进经验，就破坏了科学的稳定性、系统性和完整性”。
    那么，我们就来谈谈关于“稳定性”的问题。科学也是按照辩证的规律发展的，有相对稳定性。但这种稳定性，只是相对的、暂时的，而它的变动发展则是永久的、绝对的。任何事物都在变动，都在发展。科学的任务就是要反映这种变动，反映这种发展。事物的变动和发展，是科学能够发展的根据，科学所以能够不断地发展，就是因为客观事物在不断地发展。现在我国社会主义建设正在大跃进，我们的农村已经进入大跃进的高潮，我们的科学要很好的反映这个大跃进，站在这个大跃进的前头，和大跃进一起前进。
    现在不是谈什么“稳定性”的时候，我国粮食单位面积产量已经突破一万斤，两万斤，出现了五万多斤，大面积丰产都在千斤以上。资产阶级的学者却还在拿五百斤的老东西去教。大家都在那里飞跃前进，他们却说“慢一点，不能走，起码要稳定两三年！”它的作用到底是促进，还是促退？
    我们这样说，这些“学者”又要吓唬人了：“好哇，我们讲跃进，但是科学的系统性、完整性破坏了怎么办呢？！”不要怕。系统性，让它破。完整性，让它破。破得愈彻底愈好。旧的不破，新的不立。把那个旧的、臭的、反动的完整性、系统性破了，破得稀烂，新的、革命的、完整的系统的东西，就出来了。这个新的、完整的、系统的东西，一定是后来居上，旧的是望尘莫及的。列宁曾经批判过，资产阶级总喜欢讲什么永恒的规律，世界上就没有什么永恒的规律，所谓永恒的规律都是虚构的。
    所有讲什么稳定性、系统性、完整性的人，目的只有一个，就是要保持旧的一套，拒绝为社会主义总路线服务，拒绝为农业大跃进服务。
    “人口论”和增产问题
    第四个问题，这次会议上，揭发了资产阶级经济学者在理论上的老根子，所谓马尔萨斯的人口论、土地报酬递减律。他们拿这一套做本钱，散布反对农业大跃进，反对社会主义总路线的胡说。
    为什么要把这个问题提出来呢？因为在这次会议上，还有个别的人思想上对批判人口论不大通。有人讲：“说起人口论来当然不对，但究竟是自然存在的规律。”有人讲：“想一想，似乎有点不对，又一想，似乎还有可取之处。”人口论究竟有没有可取之处，究竟是不是科学？马克思、恩格斯、列宁说得很多。马克思说：“马尔萨斯不是一个科学家，只是一个被人收买的辩护士，是英国工人阶级敌人的辩护者，是统治阶级一个无耻的阿谀者。”“马尔萨斯所作的结论是为了一般统治阶级的利益，特别是为了这些统治阶级中的反动分子的利益，换句话说，他是为了这种利益而捏造科学。”一切新的旧的马尔萨斯人口论者，都是站在剥削阶级的立场上来看待人口问题的，把劳动人民的贫穷，说成是由于人口增殖过快这个自然的原因，从而为剥削阶级的制度开脱罪责。
    现在对于青年影响最大的谬论是所谓人口是按几何级数增长，而生活资料的产量只能是按算术级数增长，生活资料的增长永远赶不上人口增长的速度。事实怎样呢？我们中国农业的大跃进，就把马尔萨斯的人口论打了个稀烂。我国社会主义农业生产的现实说明：生活资料的增长速度远远地超过了人口的增长速度。我们今年的人口可能增加2％多一点；但是我们今年的粮食夏收增长了69％，全年可能增加60％—90％。这到底是哪一个增加的慢，哪一个增加的快？
    但是资产阶级学者对我国农业生产大跃进、粮食大增产的事实，硬是不愿看，不愿听；看到和听到了，还要制造种种谬论加以反对。
    关于大面积丰产问题，他们说：“小面积丰产可以，大面积丰产没有希望。”那么请看事实：安徽全省六百一十三万亩早稻产量平均亩产一千零三斤。湖北全省四百六十二万亩早稻平均亩产一千零三十三斤。江苏全省二百六十万亩早稻平均亩产一千零十四斤。全省亩产千斤，这是多大的事情。在这样的事实面前，你还说大面积丰产不可能吗？
    丰产能不能持久？有人讲：“今年丰产，明年不一定；明年丰产，后年不一定。”丰产能不能持久？能够持久，这是肯定的。去年我们麦子千斤亩只有十万多亩，今年千斤亩是一百多万亩。水稻仅安徽、江苏两个省千斤亩就是八百七十多万亩，大面积丰产的范围一年比一年扩大，这是谁也无法推翻的事实。
    于是他们最后又来了一条：“你说的丰产事实，我不否认，但是你这个丰产是划不来的！”丰产划不来，不丰产倒划得来！亩产一千斤叫“划不来”，一百斤倒“划得来”。这是什么理论？资产阶级学者先生们，你们所谓“划得来”，是从资本家剥削工人来说的，少剥削几个就划不来了，多剥削几个就划得来了。我们现在搞社会主义，根本不是那么回事！我们有一亿多农户，大家都鼓劲去干，干出他个几千上万斤，是这个划得来呢？还是大家闲着手，坐吃山空划得来呢？道理应该是很清楚的。
    某些学者说什么“人口多，消费就多，积累就少”；“人口多是中国的致命伤，人口问题是中国的主要问题”，这些都是荒谬的奇谈怪论。刘少奇同志在党的八大二次会议的工作报告里说：“他们只看到人是消费者，人多消费要多，而不首先看到人是生产者，人多就有可能生产得更多，积累得更多。”所以我们说，人多是件好事，不是一件坏事。
    以前曾经有人问我们农业部，说现在人口增加得这样快，你们农业部究竟有什么准备？我们说有准备，全国人民在共产党领导下，准备了年年大丰产。所谓“方法可取”“资料可用”
    第五个问题，就是研究方法问题。在这个问题上，我们和资产阶级的经济学者也是对立的。有人说：卜凯的理论是反动的，方法是可取的，资料是可用的。
    方法是否可取？先要看一看是什么方法。卜凯的理论和他的方法是一致的，卜凯的理论是反动的，方法是主观唯心的。他的方法是掩盖阶级实质的形而上学的方法，是从各方面蒙蔽真象、欺骗群众的方法。我们用的方法是唯物辩证的方法，是阶级分析的方法，是群众路线的方法。所谓“理论是反动的，方法是可取的”，这种说法，是完全错误的。
    “资料是可用的”这句话对不对？经过大家讨论，也有两种看法，叫做两种不同的利用观。
    一种是资产阶级学者的利用观。他们说：科学有继承性，我们不用这些材料，有什么办法去赶国际水平？这种说法是错误的、反动的。我们所要继承的是进步的、革命的，而不是反动的。所谓国际水平，应该是进步的、革命的国际水平。现在最先进的国际水平，就是社会主义，社会主义已经超过了资本主义。你把中国的土地改革问题、社会主义改造问题、农业大跃进这一套，真正研究一番，发挥一番，这才是真正的国际水平。想把卜凯的东西拿来继承，只会把学生引到绝路上去，这是一种反动的利用观。
    另外还有革命的利用观，卜凯的农业经济、土地利用、农场管理学等几本书，是反动的，但我们并不把它烧掉，我们要用它作为帝国主义分子、反动统治阶级的一种罪证，在适当的场合，采取批判的观点，用它作反面教材，可以让人们看到过去那些帝国主义分子、反动经济学者，是怎样进攻农民、歪曲真象和散布毒素的。
    今后的任务
    第一，必须政治挂帅，要按照党的总路线、党的方针、政策进行工作。理论工作必须以现实的阶级斗争和生产斗争作为出发点，为建设社会主义服务，为农业生产大跃进服务，为人民公社化服务，为我国农业的现代化服务。并在服务的过程中，发展农业经济科学。
    第二，要系统地学习毛泽东同志的著作。毛主席的思想是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的、活生生的、创造性的马克思列宁主义。今后农业经济的研究工作和教学工作都要以毛主席的思想为纲。我们在学习毛主席著作时，还要学习马、恩、列、斯的著作；在学习这些经典著作的时候，要学习毛主席把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的方法，不能把两者分割开来看。
    第三，继续批判资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，也还要克服教条主义思想。在农业经济科学领域中，既要解决资产阶级和无产阶级两条道路的问题，也还必须解决两种方法的问题。
    第四，要深入农村、深入实际，进行劳动锻炼，改造思想，与工农相结合。现在要决心下乡，在与农民同生活、同劳动的过程中，进行人民公社和农民生活、生产情况的调查，使理论研究密切结合实际。
    第五，各学校的农业经济课，都应该以毛主席的著作、党中央的文件作为主要教材和编辑教材的指导思想。要动手编写中国社会主义农业经济学教科书，各地都要编，采取大家动手、领导和群众相结合的办法。
    第六，下决心建立起一支强大的、又红又专的农业经济科学的理论队伍。大力从人民公社和农村工作干部中培养出一批工农骨干，提高现有的无产阶级的理论干部，改造资产阶级知识分子，要几方面齐头并进。
