Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Saigon dispatch: U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy made a statement to reporters in Saigon on the 21st, once again issuing dangerous war provocations and calls for military intervention against the Chinese people. This is the latest in a series of similar statements made by senior U.S. military and government personnel in recent days.

According to reports, when McElroy spoke about China's decision to resume shelling Jinmen to punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops, he said: If Communist China goes "too far" and the Nationalists cannot resist them, the United States should intervene according to the agreement it has with the Nationalists (Chiang Kai-shek group) to assist the Nationalists.

As everyone knows, Dulles is in Taipei discussing with Chiang Kai-shek how to "further implement" the U.S.-Chiang military treaty.

McElroy also arrogantly acted as the "Emperor" of the Chinese people, making unwarranted comments on China's internal war measures, and openly stated that the United States would take action to "protect" the Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Jinmen and Mazu. He said: "It seems that the Chinese Communists are determined to continue the war and determined to seize the islands of Jinmen and Mazu by force, and our policy is to resist any forcible seizure."

Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Washington dispatch: Following the warmongering clamors of some U.S. military leaders, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining yelled yesterday that the U.S.'s "national policy requires that we use nuclear weapons whenever it is in our interest to do so"; U.S. strategy requires fighting the enemy "on our terms, not the enemy's terms."

In a speech to the Association of the United States Army, Twining once again demonstrated that the United States is pursuing this insane policy of preparing to launch a nuclear war. He said: "We should be prepared to use these weapons."

Twining rehashed the cliché of using "strength" to "oppose Communist expansion," and tried his best to advocate that the United States and its allies should "maintain military and industrial strength" to oppose the socialist camp. He said that the U.S. Army should become a dense, mobile force with strong striking power, and should emphasize firepower and speed. To this end, he demanded that the Army concentrate its efforts on developing certain nuclear weapons and the most lethal weapons.

He also emphasized the role of the Air Force, because the Air Force is "suitable for rapidly inflicting huge destructive blows on the enemy."

    任你穷凶极恶　老虎还是纸糊
    麦克耳罗伊对我国人民进行恫吓
    特文宁叫嚣美国准备使用核武器
    新华社22日讯  西贡消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊21日在西贡对记者发表谈话，再一次向中国人民发出危险的战争挑衅和军事干涉的叫嚣。这是最近几天里美国高级军政人员接连发表类似谈话的又一次。
    据报道，麦克耳罗伊在谈到中国为了惩罚蒋军而恢复炮击金门的决定时说：如果共产党中国作得“太过份”，而国民党人不能抗拒他们的话，美国应当根据它和国民党（蒋介石集团）缔结的协定进行干预，来协助国民党。
    大家知道，杜勒斯正在台北同蒋介石商谈如何“进一步实施”美蒋军事条约的问题。
    麦克耳罗伊还硬以中国人民的“太上皇”自居，对中国的内战措施妄加评论，并公然表示美国将采取行动来“保护”蒋介石军队盘踞在金门马祖。他说：“看来中国共产党人决心要使战争继续下去，决心用武力夺取金门和马祖两岛，而我们的政策是抵抗任何强行夺取。”
    新华社22日讯　华盛顿消息：继美国一些军事头目发出好战叫嚣之后，美国参谋长联席会议主席特文宁昨天叫嚷说，美国的“国家政策要求，只要使用核武器对我们有利，就使用这种武器”；美国的战略要求“根据我们的条件而不是敌人的条件”来同敌人作战。
    特文宁在对美国陆军协会发表谈话时，再一次表明了美国奉行的是这种准备发动核战争的疯狂政策。他说：“我们应该作好使用这种武器的准备。”
    特文宁重弹所谓要以“实力”来“反对共产党的扩张”的滥调，竭力鼓吹美国和它的盟国要“保持军事和工业力量”来反对社会主义阵营。他说，美国的陆军应该成为一支密集的、机动的、具有强大打击力量的部队，应该强调火力和速度。为此，他要求陆军集中力量来发展某些核武器和杀伤力最大的武器。
    他还强调空军的作用，因为空军“适合于迅速给敌人以巨大的毁灭性打击”。
