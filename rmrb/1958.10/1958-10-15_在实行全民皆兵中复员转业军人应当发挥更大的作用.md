Comrades, demobilized and transferred military personnel and militiamen across the country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, are engaging in the great cause of socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm, and have achieved great victories on all fronts. In particular, this year's agriculture has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. Now, the entire nation is taking steel as the key, seizing every second, and carrying out a great leap forward on the steel front, which will surely achieve even greater successes on this front. In order to resist American imperialist aggression and conquer nature, all parts of the country are organizing and implementing universal military service while the people's commune movement is developing widely, establishing militia divisions and regiments everywhere. In just one month, Fujian Province established 131 militia divisions, Jiangsu Province 185 divisions, and Beijing Municipality 156 divisions. Chairman Mao said: "The organization of militia division is very good and should be promoted. This is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization." "The imperialists are bullying us so much that we need to deal with them seriously. We must not only have a strong regular army, but also vigorously establish militia divisions. In this way, when imperialism invades us, it will make it impossible for them to move an inch." Premier Zhou said: "The Chinese people feel extremely angry about the war provocations of American imperialism. The powerful demonstrations of hundreds of millions of people in urban and rural areas across the country against American aggression, and the vigorous development of the universal military service movement in various places, are the Chinese people's powerful answers to American aggressors." Implementing universal military service is not only conducive to the scientific organization and allocation of labor to march towards nature, but also facilitates the mobilization of the entire people to arm themselves and annihilate invading enemies when imperialism launches a war of aggression.

In universal military service, demobilized and transferred military personnel should play a greater role. As Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, said: "Demobilized soldiers should become the backbone of the militia." Because our six million-plus demobilized and transferred military personnel are all good soldiers educated by our Party and Chairman Mao, and are outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. They have high political awareness, strong organizational discipline, and most of them are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and meritorious model combat heroes. In the long revolutionary war in the past, many demobilized and transferred military personnel personally defeated Japanese imperialism and annihilated millions of Chiang Kai-shek's American-equipped troops. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, they also severely taught the invading armies of sixteen countries headed by American imperialism. In the process of competing with these enemies, our comrades have been trained to be more resourceful, brave, and as strong as steel. Therefore, after our comrades are demobilized and transferred, they are not only the backbone force for maintaining social order, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, opposing rightists, and capturing airborne and lurking special agents, but also an active force in various construction undertakings such as industry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, construction, exploration, and culture and education. Especially in the great leap forward in production, demobilized and transferred military personnel have demonstrated the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army, actively invested in various constructions with soaring enthusiasm, worked hard and lived plainly, and were not afraid of difficulties. They closely followed the people of the whole country, actively implemented the Party's various policies; in the march to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy and transform nature, they fully demonstrated their indomitable spirit and the heroic spirit of bravely moving forward; in the cultural and technological revolution movement, they had the communist style of daring to be original. Comrades who have been demobilized and transferred are welcomed and loved by the masses everywhere, and most of them are the grassroots backbone of various local work. In the statistics of 310,000 demobilized and transferred military personnel in Henan Province alone, 230,000 were elected as grassroots cadres and advanced workers. As the central government said, this is a valuable and active force. Many of our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades have become all-round talents who are capable of both writing and fighting. In the universal military service movement, especially in the work of vigorously establishing militia divisions, comrades are not only active propagandists and organizers of Party organizations, but also very good military and political instructors and cadres in the militia. Comrades are and will be the backbone force of universal military service.

Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades have all been educated by the Party in the army, are loyal to serving the people's revolutionary cause, and are familiar with the military work and political work of the army. Therefore, in implementing universal military service, in addition to actively taking the lead in participating in the militia, the more important thing is to implement the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army into all aspects of universal military service. What should be implemented in universal military service? I think:

　　1. Implement military organization. The People's Liberation Army has a strict organization, which we are all familiar with. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades should implement this tradition into universal military service, realize military organization, and make the whole people have a strict organization like the army. In this way, it is convenient for large-scale labor cooperation, convenient for transforming nature, convenient for learning and conducting communist education, convenient for universal military training and sports activities, and convenient for organized mobilization and annihilation of enemies when imperialism invades. In this way, every militia member "can be a worker in the factory, a farmer in the field, and a soldier with a gun, becoming an all-round talent who is both red and expert."

　　2. Implement combat operations. The People's Liberation Army has a spirit of indomitable advance. As Chairman Mao pointed out, it must overwhelm all enemies and never be subdued by enemies. In any difficult and arduous situation, as long as there is one person left, this person must continue to fight. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades should bring this tenacious fighting style to universal military service, use the spirit of combat to engage in production, engage in work, engage in learning, and use the spirit of combat to overcome all difficulties. When marching towards nature, we must have the heroic spirit of "mountains bowing their heads and rivers making way"; when fighting against domestic and foreign class enemies, we should despise all enemies, bravely move forward with a fearless heroic spirit, and resolutely, decisively, thoroughly, and completely annihilate the enemies.

　　3. Implement collective life. The People's Liberation Army has lived a military communist life for a long time, implementing a supply system. In the long collective life, the entire army has developed strict organization, discipline, a high sense of collectivism and good habits of cooperation, and has the fine traditions of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, unity between the army and the people, unity between the army and the government, and unity between me and my friends. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades should bring this tradition to universal military service, use it to overcome the backward habits of selfishness and not taking care of the overall situation left in a few people by the old society, so as to enhance the people's organization and discipline, cultivate a sense of collectivism and communist ideas, and unite the broad masses of people around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, using the communist method of large-scale collaboration to accelerate socialist construction.

　　4. Implement putting politics in command. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades all have a high degree of political awareness. We must not only remember the traditions of military democracy, political democracy, economic democracy, and following the mass line in the army, but also carry forward this tradition, bring this tradition to universal military service, use democratic methods to discuss things with the masses; use the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly to educate the militia; use the method of debate to improve the people's ideological awareness, strengthen the militia's education in patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism; give priority to ideas in everything, set examples and plant red flags everywhere, so that the militia comrades are energetic, in a good mood, have lively ideas, and are united.

　　5. Go all out and strive for the top. The People's Liberation Army has always had abundant enthusiasm. It strives to be a pioneer in fighting, and also competes in capturing prisoners and seizing guns. It strives to go wherever there are difficulties, and strives to make contributions to the people in everything. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades must carry forward this glorious tradition, go all out with revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive for the top in the movements of vigorously developing steel, vigorously developing grain, vigorously developing machinery, and vigorously promoting cultural revolution and technological revolution, so as to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically.

　　6. Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and give play to the spirit of originality. The People's Liberation Army has gone from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, and has seized the enemy's weapons to arm itself, and has defeated various modern and powerful enemies with inferior equipment. Now, it is victoriously defending the motherland and the cause of world peace. The entire historical development process of our army is a revolutionary process of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. This is a brilliant example of Chairman Mao combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and it is the development of Marxist-Leninist military science. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades must earnestly study Chairman Mao's spirit of originality, break superstitions, liberate their minds, boldly invent and create, and march towards various scientific and technological fields.

　　7. Have the spirit of continuous revolution. The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting team and a working team. It goes from one victory to another, and always moves forward holding high the banner of Chairman Mao. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades must bring this vigorous spirit of continuous revolution to universal military service. We must remember the truth taught by Chairman Mao: "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind," overcome arrogance and complacency, and make our work, production, and study always energetic, vigorous, and continuously move forward.

　　8. Maintain the fine tradition of hard work and plain living. The People's Liberation Army has always had the fine traditional style of hard work and plain living. This is what our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades all know. We must not only maintain this traditional style, but also bring this style to universal military service, work diligently, pay attention to saving, overcome the atmosphere of extravagance and waste, and cultivate a good style of building the country through diligence and thrift, running the community through diligence and thrift, and running all undertakings through diligence and thrift.

　　9. Greatly establish the communist style. The People's Liberation Army is selfless and always wholeheartedly serves the country and the people. When fighting, no matter what kind of enemy, it will resolutely annihilate it; when there are difficulties, no matter how big or small, it will resolutely overcome them; when working, no matter what region or when, it will definitely do it well. At any time, it does not care about personal gains or losses. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades are very familiar with this communist style. We must not only maintain this noble style, but also carry forward this communist style in universal military service to accelerate socialist construction.

　　10. Always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao. Our Party and Chairman Mao have led us in decades of revolutionary struggle, defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad, and enabled us to gain liberation. Now, they are leading us to build a great socialism and striving to realize communism. The Communist Party is our lighthouse, and Chairman Mao is our banner of victory. Our demobilized and transferred military personnel comrades must always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, stand firm on the revolutionary stand, and advance forever under the banner of Chairman Mao.

Now, hundreds of millions of men, women, young people, and adults are organizing and arming themselves to implement universal military service. This is a large army for production and labor, and also a large army for defending the motherland. Comrades who have been demobilized and transferred should become the backbone force in this large army. We are a big country of 600 million people, with a powerful standing army equipped with modern equipment, and an infinitely strong armed force of the people. The safety of our great motherland is reliably guaranteed. If imperialism dares to invade our motherland, it will be submerged in the sea of our entire people's armed forces.

    在实行全民皆兵中复员转业军人应当发挥更大的作用
    傅秋涛
    在党中央和毛主席的领导下，全国复员转业军人和民兵同志与广大人民一道，都以冲天的干劲，从事伟大的社会主义建设，在各个战线上都取得了伟大的胜利，特别是今年的农业已获得空前的大丰收，现在全民又以钢为纲，以分秒必争的精神，在钢铁战线上实行大进军，一定能够在这个战线上获得更大的成就。为了反抗美帝国主义侵略，为了征服自然，全国各地在人民公社运动普遍发展的同时，到处都组织起来，实行全民皆兵，成立民兵师团。在短短一个月时间内，仅福建省就建立了一百三十一个民兵师，江苏省一百八十五个师，北京市一百五十六个师。毛主席说：“民兵师的组织很好，应当推广。这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我们的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”周总理说：“中国人民对于美国帝国主义的战争挑衅，感到极大的愤怒。全国城乡数亿人民反对美国侵略的强大示威，全国各地蓬勃发展的全民皆兵运动，是中国人民对美国侵略者的有力回答。”实行全民皆兵，不但便于科学地组织和调配劳动力向自然界进军，同时，也是为了在帝国主义发动侵略战争的时候，便于动员全民武装，歼灭进犯的敌人。
    在全民皆兵中，复员转业军人应当发挥更大的作用。正如国防部长彭德怀元帅所说：“复员军人应当成为民兵的骨干。”因为，我们六百多万复员转业军人，都是我们党和毛主席教育下的好战士，是中国人民的优秀儿女，政治觉悟较高，组织纪律性较强，多数是共产党员、共青团员，和功臣模范战斗英雄。在过去长期的革命战争中，许多复员转业军人，当时就亲手打败过日本帝国主义，歼灭过蒋介石数百万美式装备的军队，在抗美援朝战争中，也狠狠地教训过以美帝国主义为首的十六个国家的侵略军队，在与这些敌人较量的过程中，使我们的同志锻炼得更加机智、勇敢，像钢铁一样的坚强。因此，当我们同志复员转业之后，不仅是维护社会治安、镇反、反对右派以及捕捉空降和潜伏特务等各种斗争的骨干力量，而且是工业、农业、商业、交通、建筑、勘探、文教等各项建设事业上的积极力量。特别是在生产大跃进中，复员转业军人更是发挥了人民解放军的优良传统，以冲天的干劲，积极投入各项建设，艰苦朴素，不怕困难，紧紧与全国人民一道，积极贯彻执行党的各项政策；在大搞农田水利、改造自然的进军中，充分表现了顽强不屈的精神和勇往直前的英雄气概；在文化技术革命的运动中，具有敢于独创的共产主义风格，复员转业军人同志，处处得到群众的欢迎和爱戴，而且多数是地方各项工作的基层骨干。仅在河南省三十一万复员转业军人的统计中，就有二十三万人当选为基层干部和先进工作者。正如中央所说，这是一批宝贵的积极的力量。我们许多复员转业军人同志，已经成为能文、能武的全面人材。在全民皆兵的运动中，特别是大办民兵师的工作中，同志们不但是党组织的积极的宣传者和组织者，而且是民兵中很好的军政教员和干部，同志们在现在和将来都是全民皆兵的骨干力量。
    我们复员转业军人同志，都是在军队中受过党的教育，忠心耿耿为人民革命事业服务，都熟悉军队的军事工作和政治工作。因此，在实行全民皆兵的时候，除了要积极带头参加民兵之外，更重要的事情，就是要把人民解放军的优良传统，贯彻到全民皆兵的各项工作中去。哪些应当在全民皆兵中贯彻呢？我觉得：
    一、要贯彻组织军事化。人民解放军是有严密组织的，这是我们大家都熟悉的。我们复员转业军人同志，要把这种传统贯彻到全民皆兵中去，实现组织军事化，使全民像军队一样也有严密的组织。这样，就便于劳动大协作，便于改造大自然，便于学习和进行共产主义教育，便于全民练武和体育活动，一旦帝国主义侵略的时候，便于有组织地动员，歼灭敌人。这样，使每一个民兵成员“做到进工厂是工人，下田是农民，拿枪是军人，成为又红又专的全面人材。”
    二、要贯彻行动战斗化。人民解放军具有一往无前的精神，正如毛主席所指出的，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服，不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。我们复员转业军人同志，要把这种顽强的战斗作风，带到全民皆兵中去，要用战斗的精神去从事生产、从事工作、从事学习，要用战斗的精神去克服一切困难。当向大自然进军的时候，我们要具有使“高山低头，河水让路”的气壮山河的英雄气概；当向国内外阶级敌人进行斗争的时候，我们应蔑视一切敌人，以大无畏的英雄气魄，勇猛直前，坚决、干脆、彻底、全部歼灭敌人。
    三、要贯彻生活集体化。人民解放军过去长期过的是军事共产主义生活，实行供给制。在长期的集体生活中，使全军养成严格的组织性、纪律性和高度的集体观念和良好的协作习惯，并具有官兵一致，上下一致，军民一致，军政一致，我友一致的优良传统。我们复员转业军人同志，要把这种传统带到全民皆兵中去，用它来克服旧社会遗留在少数群众中的自私自利、不照顾全面的落后习惯，以增强人民的组织性、纪律性，培养集体主义观念和共产主义思想，使广大人民团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，以共产主义的大协作方法，加速社会主义建设。
    四、要贯彻政治挂帅。我们复员转业军人同志，都具有高度的政治觉悟，我们不但要记住在部队中的军事民主、政治民主、经济民主和走群众路线的传统，而且要发扬这种传统，要把这种传统带到全民皆兵中去，要用民主的方法同群众商量办事；要把全心全意地为人民服务的思想去教育民兵；要用辩论方法，提高人民的思想觉悟，要加强民兵的爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义教育；事事要思想领先，处处立标兵、插红旗，使民兵同志精神奋发，心情舒畅，思想活泼，团结一致。
    五、要鼓足干劲，力争上游。人民解放军的干劲，向来是充沛的，打仗争先锋，捉俘虏、缴枪也要比赛，哪里有困难就争取到哪里去，事事都争取为人民立功。我们复员转业军人同志，要发扬这种光荣传统，鼓足革命干劲，在大搞钢铁、大搞粮食、大搞机械、大闹文化革命和技术革命运动中，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。
    六、要敢想、敢说、敢干，发挥独创精神。人民解放军从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，就是夺取敌人的武器来武装自己，又以劣势的装备打败了各种现代化的强大敌人，现在又胜利地保卫着祖国和世界和平事业。我军整个历史的发展过程，就是敢想、敢说、敢干的革命过程，这是毛主席把马列主义普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的光辉范例，它是马列主义军事科学的发展。我们复员转业军人同志，要认真学习毛主席这种独创精神，破除迷信，解放思想，大胆发明创造，向各种科学技术进军。
    七、要有不断革命的精神。人民解放军永远是战斗队，又是工作队，它是由一个胜利走向一个胜利，永远高举毛主席的旗帜前进。我们复员转业军人同志，要把这种旺盛的不断革命的精神，带到全民皆兵中去，要记住毛主席教导我们的：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的真理，克服骄傲自满，使我们的工作、生产和学习，永远朝气蓬勃，雷厉风行，不断前进。
    八、要保持艰苦朴素的优良传统。人民解放军一向有艰苦朴素的优良传统作风。这是我们复员转业军人同志都知道的。我们不但要保持这种传统作风，而且要把这种作风带到全民皆兵中去，勤劳动，讲节省，克服铺张浪费的风气，培养勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的良好作风。
    九、要大立共产主义风格。人民解放军就是大公无私，向来是全心全意为国家、为人民服务。打仗吗，不管什么敌人，都坚决把它歼灭；困难吗，不论大小困难，都坚决把它克服；工作吗，不论什么地区、什么时候，都一定把它作好。任何时候，都不计较个人得失。这种共产主义风格，我们复员转业军人同志都是很熟悉的，我们不但要保持这种崇高的风格，而且要在全民皆兵中发扬这种共产主义风格，加速社会主义建设。
    十、永远听党的话，听毛主席的话。我们党和毛主席领导我们进行数十年的革命斗争，打败过国内外的强大的敌人，使我们获得翻身解放。现在，又领导我们建设伟大的社会主义，并为实现共产主义而奋斗。共产党是我们的灯塔，毛主席是我们的胜利旗帜。我们复员转业军人同志，要永远听党的话，听毛主席的话，站稳革命立场，在毛主席的旗帜下，永远前进。
    现在，亿万男女青壮年，正在组织起来，武装起来，实行全民皆兵。这是一支生产劳动大军，又是一支保卫祖国的战斗大军。复员转业军人同志，应当成为这支大军中的骨干力量。我们是六亿人的大国，有现代化装备的强大的常备军队，又有无限雄厚的人民群众的武装力量，我们伟大祖国的安全，是有牢靠保障的。如果帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们祖国，它将淹没在我们全民武装的大海里。
