    Late Stubble Wheat
    Late stubble wheat is also known as returning stubble wheat. It refers to winter wheat planted in northern regions on land where late autumn crops have been harvested. Fields planted with late stubble wheat or returning stubble wheat are generally double-cropped in a year (one crop of wheat and one crop of miscellaneous grains, etc.). Early stubble wheat and regular stubble wheat are generally single-cropped in a year.
