Title: Thinking of Last Year, This Day, This Year

Thinking of last year, this day, this year,
The first satellite ascended to the sky,
I, like a naive child,
Wrote poems of praise.
Imagination grew wings to ride the clouds,
My heart filled with joy,
The sound of the telegraph's "dada,"
Still rings intimately in my ears.

Satellites are the flowers of socialism,
Blooming from the ground into the sky,
Each one bigger than the last,
Each one more vividly red.
My heart silently anticipates,
Anticipates such a moment,
"The Soviet satellite has flown to the Moon,"
A piece of news suddenly appears before my eyes.

From last year to this year,
How many "firsts" have come from the Soviet Union?
The imperialists gnash their teeth,
Thrown far behind.
A year is a short time,
The world has greatly changed,
On the land of socialism,
One new "satellite" after another appears!

    今年今天想去年
    臧克家
  今年今天想去年，
  第一颗卫星升上天，
  我像一个天真的孩子，
  写下了歌颂的诗篇。
  幻想扎上了腾云翅，
  心胸给快乐充满，
  哒哒电波的声音，
  还亲切地响在耳边。
  卫星是社会主义的花，
  从地下开到天空，
  一朵比一朵肥大，
  一朵比一朵鲜红。
  我的心在默默期待，
  期待这样一个时间，
  “苏联的卫星飞到了月宫，”
  一个消息突然出现在眼前。
  从去年到今年，
  多少个“第一”出在苏联？
  帝国主义者咬碎了牙齿，
  远远地被摔到了后边。
  一年的时间很短，
  世界已经大变，
  社会主义的土地上，
  一颗颗新的“卫星”出现！
