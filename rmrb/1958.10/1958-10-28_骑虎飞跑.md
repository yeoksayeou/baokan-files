Riding the tiger and flying, half-work and half-study,
    The news spreads, a smile on the lips, the heart leaps.
    Everywhere they talk about it, clapping their hands and cheering,
    The Party's policy is really good!
    School - factory, factory - school,
    Four combinations, a broad road to both red and expert.
    Training cadres, the quality is particularly high;
    The white flag is pulled down, the red flag flutters.
    Fighting hard for half a month, the infrastructure is well done.
    Starting from scratch, running the school frugally.
    Self-labor, self-transformation.
    Machines roar, chimneys stand tall and dense.
    Going to work in the morning, light smoke curls up.
    Studying and working, riding the tiger and flying!

### 骑虎飞跑

    骑虎飞跑半工半读，消息传到，嘴边微笑，心蹦蹦跳。处处谈论，拍手叫好，党的政策，实在是好！学校—工厂，工厂—学校，四个结合，红专大道。培养干部，质量特高；白旗拔掉，红旗飘飘。奋战半月，基建搞好。白手起家，勤俭办校。自己劳动，自我改造。机器隆响，烟囱林茂。早晨上工，青烟袅袅。读书劳动，骑虎飞跑！
