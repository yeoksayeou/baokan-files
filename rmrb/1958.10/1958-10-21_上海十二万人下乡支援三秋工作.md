Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th - A voluntary labor army of 120,000 people composed of cadres, workers, teachers, students, officers, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai has been dispatched in batches to people's communes in Shanghai, Baoshan, Jiading, and Pudong counties in the past two days to participate in the Three Autumn Harvest labor, ensuring that grain and cotton are harvested in a timely manner and stored in warehouses, striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. This is the largest urban support for agricultural labor in Shanghai to date.

This voluntary labor army is organized according to the principles of militarized organization, combat-oriented action, and collectivized life. Those participating in voluntary labor are all carrying their own backpacks and walking to the countryside, breaking the previous practice of taking cars to the countryside to participate in labor.

    上海十二万人下乡支援三秋工作
    据新华社上海20日电　上海市机关干部、工人、教师、学生、解放军官兵和社会人士所组成的一支十二万人的义务劳动大军，这两天已分批开赴上海、宝山、嘉定、浦东等县人民公社参加三秋劳动，确保粮食棉花及时收获，颗粒入仓，争取明年农业生产更大跃进。这是上海城市人民支援农业劳动规模最大的一次。
    这支义务劳动大军是按照组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的原则组织起来的。参加义务劳动的人们，都是自己背背包，徒步前往，打破了过去坐车下乡参加劳动的常规。
