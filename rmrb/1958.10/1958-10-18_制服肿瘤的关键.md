    The Key to Conquering Tumors
    Yushan
    The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences has mobilized the masses to carry out research work to conquer malignant tumors within five years. This is a brilliant example of the spirit of the Chinese medical and health community in breaking superstitions, daring to think, speak, and act, and establishing the red flag of the Party's mass line in research work. Since the start of this work, many achievements have been made. It can be affirmed that, due to mobilizing the masses to conduct in-depth research based on reality and the correct direction, this work will continue to achieve greater success.
    Following the mass line is the key to the great leap forward in scientific research. It is one approach to have a few people in the laboratory, quietly, using a small amount of material, conducting research detached from practical data; it is another approach to mobilize the masses to collect a large amount of practical data, give play to collective wisdom, and discuss and study together. Which approach is more, faster, better, and more economical? The example of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences proves that it belongs to the latter. Science comes from practice. Mobilizing the masses to engage in science can most widely connect with reality, and scientifically analyze and deduce the large amount of historical data and living data obtained in practical work, which will inevitably promote the accelerated development of research work. For example, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences closely integrates research work with the clinical treatment of its affiliated tumor hospital, obtaining data in a timely manner during clinical treatment; organizing youth commando teams to mobilize young people to participate in research work, and in just over twenty days, they rushed to sort out the data related to tumors from Peking Union Medical College Hospital over the past forty years; cooperating with street cadres in Beijing, they completed a plan for large-scale cervical tumor screening for women in three weeks; in terms of treatment, adopting comprehensive treatment methods that take the patient as the starting point, and at the same time widely collecting effective treatment methods in the practice of tumor treatment in the Chinese medical community for research. All these measures have created favorable conditions for accelerating the development of research work. At present, great progress has been made in tumor research, especially in cervical tumors in women, where methods for prevention are already being tested, which is clear evidence.
    However, for bourgeois professors and experts, it is difficult to understand the Party's leadership in mobilizing the masses to conduct research, and they hold an attitude of resistance. They believe that scientific research can only be carried out by a few "scholars" and "knowledgeable" people, that the "satellites" launched by the broad masses in the Great Leap Forward are not scientific, and that mobilizing young people to march towards science will "mess things up." They look down on the current achievements and act as onlookers, sneering there. Facts will soon break their granite heads. They are stumbling blocks to mobilizing the masses to engage in scientific research. Therefore, at present, to mobilize the masses to engage in scientific research, mobilizing the masses does not mean that experts are not needed, but to combine experts with the masses; but it is necessary to oppose the bourgeois expert line in scientific research. The primary task is to not let stumbling blocks block the way under the leadership of the Party, so as to break through the first hurdle of the Great Leap Forward and move forward with great strides.

    制服肿瘤的关键
    雨山
    中国医学科学院发动群众开展研究工作，要在五年内制服恶性肿瘤，这是我国医药卫生界在医学科学工作方面，打破迷信，敢说敢想敢作，在研究工作上树立党的群众路线的红旗的光辉一例。这一工作开展以来，已获得了不少成绩，可以肯定，由于发动群众深入实际进行研究，方向对头，这一工作将继续取得更大的成绩。
    走群众路线是科学研究工作跃进的关键。在研究室中少数人冷冷清清，就少量材料，脱离实际资料的研究，是一种路线；发动群众搜集大量实际资料，发挥集体智慧，大家讨论研究，又是一种路线。哪一种路线更多快好省呢？中国医学科学院的事例，证明属于后一种。科学来自实践，发动群众搞科学，就可以最广泛地联系实际，把实际工作中得到的大量历史资料和活资料，加以科学的分析、推理，这必然将促使研究工作加速发展。例如中国医学科学院把研究工作与其所附属的肿瘤医院的临床治疗密切结合起来，在临床治疗中，及时获得了资料；组织青年突击队，发动青年参加研究工作，仅仅二十多天，就突击整理了协和医院四十年来有关肿瘤的资料；和北京市街道干部合作，在三个星期内就完成了对妇女进行宫颈瘤大规模检查的计划；在治疗方面，采取一切为病人出发的综合疗法，同时广泛搜集中国医药界在治疗肿瘤实践中的有效治疗方法加以研究。所有这些措施，都为加速研究工作的开展创造了有利条件。目前肿瘤的研究工作已经有了很大的进展，特别是对妇女的宫颈瘤，已经着手试验预防的方法，就是明证。
    但是，党来领导，发动群众搞研究，对资产阶级的教授、专家来说是难以理解的，他们抱着对抗的情绪。他们认为科学研究工作只能由少数“学者”、“有学问”的人去搞，广大群众在大跃进中所放出的“卫星”，都不是科学，发动青年向科学进军会“搞乱”的。他们看不起目前已有的成就，摆起观潮派的劲头，在那里冷笑。事实不久将会打破他们花岗岩脑袋的。他们是发动群众大搞科学研究工作的绊脚石。因之，目前要发动群众来搞科学研究，发动群众并不是不要专家，而是要使专家和群众相结合；但是一定要反对科学研究工作中的资产阶级专家路线。首要任务是在党的领导下，不让绊脚石挡路，才能突破跃进第一关，大踏步前进。
