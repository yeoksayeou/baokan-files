Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi said today: "If the United States regards our suspension of the bombardment of Jinmen as a sign of weakness, or misinterprets it as conforming to its 'ceasefire' demands, then it has completely miscalculated. The great Chinese people will certainly be able to break through any obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism and complete the sacred cause of unifying the motherland."

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks this evening at the National Day reception held by Wang Daier, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu and will never allow any foreign interference. Marshal Peng Dehuai, our Minister of National Defense, has already issued a message to the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, announcing a temporary cessation of the bombardment of Jinmen for seven days, provided there is no U.S. escort, and suggesting negotiations to peacefully resolve the civil war issue between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is a humanitarian measure and also a great patriotic call. Every conscientious Chinese should respond to this call, unite, and oppose our common enemy—U.S. imperialism. For the past dozen years, the Chinese people, especially the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, have tasted the bitterness of the United States using Chinese to fight Chinese. Now we must never again suffer losses from the United States. The Chinese people are fully capable of solving their own problems and will never allow the United States to interfere. If the United States regards our suspension of the bombardment of Jinmen as a sign of weakness, or misinterprets it as conforming to its 'ceasefire' demands, then it has completely miscalculated. The great Chinese people will certainly be able to break through any obstruction and sabotage by U.S. imperialism and complete the sacred cause of unifying the motherland."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "In the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, the Chinese people have received brotherly sympathy and support from the German people. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I express my heartfelt gratitude. In this struggle, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have given the Chinese people strong support. Peace-loving countries and people all over the world also stand on the side of the Chinese people. This fully proves that justice belongs to the Chinese people, and the United States is completely unreasonable. The United States has long occupied Taiwan and Penghu and is now attempting to interfere in Jinmen and Mazu in the name of 'ceasefire' to solidify the division of China in order to realize its conspiracy to create 'two Chinas.' The Chinese people will never allow this conspiracy to succeed. The Chinese people are willing to resolve the disputes between China and the United States through the Warsaw talks, but they will never allow the United States to distort one China into 'two Chinas' and distort China's internal affairs into international disputes. Today, there is only one path before United States, and that is to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw all its armed forces from the Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. Any conspiracy that the United States wants to play will absolutely not work, and it will only make the United States forever passive."

These words of Vice Premier Chen Yi were received with extremely warm welcome from the Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th - Wang Daier, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, held a grand reception in Beijing this evening to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian, President Dong Biwu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, President of the Sino-German Friendship Association Zhu Kezhen, and others attended the reception.

In his speech at the reception, Ambassador Wang Daier emphatically pointed out that the shameful provocations and bloody adventures of U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Strait region are bound to meet with complete bankruptcy. He said, "The German Democratic Republic stands closely and friendly on the side of the People's Republic of China and assures the fraternal Chinese people of its full support for their just struggle."

Ambassador Wang Daier said: "The peaceful policy consistently pursued by the German Democratic Republic is also the only path to the unification of the two Germanys into one unified, peaceful, and anti-imperialist Germany." "The sinister German militarists and imperialist agents, who have twice ignited wars in the world and are still in power in West Germany today, are plotting bloody provocations against the German Democratic Republic with the support of U.S. imperialism. But the mad acts of war and reactionary forces are destined to fail. The victory of democratic forces throughout Germany is unstoppable. The existence and development of the German Democratic Republic is the strongest pillar of this victory."

Ambassador Wang Daier said: "The German Democratic Republic faithfully and firmly stands on the basis of Marxism-Leninism in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This gives it special strength to accomplish its historical mission.

Cooperation with countries of the socialist camp, especially the fruitful friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, is developing more and more. The government and people of the German Democratic Republic observe with great admiration the bold and principled policies adopted by the People's Republic of China in consolidating its international prestige and domestic socialist transformation."

Ambassador Wang Daier warmly wished the friendship between China and Germany to be further consolidated and developed.

In his speech at the reception, Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extended warm congratulations to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. He said: "In the past nine years, the people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved tremendous achievements in socialist construction and are now working selflessly to realize the second five-year plan. The Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held in July this year, put forward the task of completing socialist construction in a short historical period. The realization of this great call will not only greatly promote the economic and cultural upsurge of the German Democratic Republic but will also further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said: "The German Democratic Republic is the western barrier of the socialist camp and an important force in preventing the U.S. aggressors from launching a new war in Europe. The German people have been carrying out unremitting struggles for consolidating European peace and for unifying their own country on the basis of peace and democracy. On September 5 this year, the government of the German Democratic Republic submitted notes to the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, requesting the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and at the same time suggested that the West German government cooperate to make the necessary preparations for peace negotiations. Although this new effort has once again been unreasonably rejected by the governments of the United States and West Germany, it will surely receive the support of more and more German people and people of all countries in the world. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support this proposal of the German Democratic Republic and are deeply convinced that the heroic German people will surely make their country a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country!"

He emphasized: "China and Germany are brother countries born in the same year and the same month in the big family of the socialist camp. In the past few years, the friendly cooperative relations between our two peoples have developed greatly. Our two countries have been continuously strengthening mutual support in the struggle to safeguard world peace. In the future, with the rapid development of the socialist construction of our two countries, the unbreakable fraternal friendship between our two peoples will surely be further developed, and our mutual assistance and cooperation in all aspects will surely be closer."

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi also reiterated the Chinese people's position on the Taiwan issue and thanked the German people for the brotherly sympathy and support given to the Chinese people in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression.

The friendly reception lasted for two hours. Among the ambassador's guests were people from all walks of life in China and envoys from various countries to China.

    陈毅副总理在民主德国国庆招待会上说
    暂停炮击绝非示弱  美国不要打错算盘
    汪戴尔大使指出美国血腥冒险定将破产
    新华社7日讯　陈毅副总理兼外交部长今天说：“如果美国把我们暂停炮击金门的行动，看成是示弱的表现，或者曲解为符合他的‘停火’要求，那他就完全打错了算盘。伟大的中国人民，一定能够冲破美帝国主义的任何阻挠和破坏，完成统一祖国的神圣事业。”
    陈毅副总理是今晚在德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔举行的国庆招待会上讲话时这样说的。
    陈毅副总理说：“中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马，决不容许任何外来干涉。我国国防部长彭德怀元帅已经向台、澎、金、马的军民同胞发出文告，宣布在没有美国护航的条件下，暂以七天为期，停止炮击金门，并且建议举行谈判，实行和平解决，来结束中国人民同蒋介石集团之间的内战问题。这是一个人道主义的措施，同时也是一个伟大的爱国主义的号召。每一个有良心的中国人，都应该响应这个号召，团结起来，反对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义。近十几年来，中国人民，特别是台、澎、金、马的军民同胞，尝尽了美国利用中国人打中国人的苦头。现在我们决不能再吃美国的亏。中国人民完全能够解决自己的问题，绝不许美国插手。如果美国把我们暂停炮击金门的行动，看成是示弱的表现，或者曲解为符合了他的‘停火’要求，那他就完全打错了算盘。伟大的中国人民，一定能够冲破美帝国主义的任何阻挠和破坏，完成统一祖国的神圣事业。”
    陈毅副总理说：“中国人民在反对美国帝国主义侵略的斗争中，得到了德国人民兄弟般的同情和支持，我代表中国政府和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。在这场斗争中，苏联和其他社会主义国家给了中国人民强有力的支持。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民也都站在中国人民这一边。这就充分证明，正义属于中国人民，美国是完全无理的。美国长期侵占台湾、澎湖，现在又企图以‘停火’为名，插手金门、马祖，把中国的分裂局面固定下来，以便于实现它制造‘两个中国’的阴谋。中国人民决不能容许这种阴谋得逞。中国人民愿意通过华沙谈判来解决中美两国之间的争端，但是，决不能容许美国把一个中国歪曲成为‘两个中国’，把中国的内政问题歪曲成为国际争端。今天摆在美国面前的只有一条路，那就是停止对中国内政的干涉，从台湾和台湾海峡撤出他的一切武装力量。美国要想玩弄任何阴谋都是绝对行不通的，它只会使美国永远被动下去。”
    陈毅副总理的这些话，受到了出席招待会的中外人士的极其热烈的欢迎。
    新华社7日讯　德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔今天晚间在北京举行盛大招待会，庆祝德意志民主共和国成立九周年。
    周恩来总理、陈毅副总理，李济深、陈叔通、程潜副委员长，董必武院长，外交部曾涌泉副部长，中德友好协会竺可桢会长等都出席了招待会。
    汪戴尔大使在招待会上的讲话中强调指出，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中华人民共和国的可耻挑衅和血腥冒险，一定要遭到彻底破产。他说，“德意志民主共和国亲密友好地站在中华人民共和国一边，并向兄弟中国人民保证全力支持他们的正义斗争。”
    汪戴尔大使说：“德意志民主共和国所一贯奉行的和平政策也是两个德国统一成为一个统一、和平和反帝的德国的唯一道路。”“曾经两度在世界上燃起战火、今天还在西德执掌政权的罪恶的德国军国主义者和帝国主义者的代理人，在美帝国主义的支持下正在策划反对德意志民主共和国的血腥挑衅。但是战争和反动势力的疯狂行为注定是要失败的。民主力量在整个德国的胜利是不可阻挡的。德意志民主共和国的存在和发展是这种胜利的最有力的支柱。”
    汪戴尔大使说：“德意志民主共和国忠实地和坚定地在马克思列宁主义的基础上站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中。这给予它特别的力量来完成它的历史任务。
    同社会主义阵营各国的合作、特别是中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国在政治、经济和文化生活各方面的卓有成效的友好合作，正在越来越发展。德意志民主共和国政府和人民怀着万分钦佩的心情注视着中华人民共和国在巩固它的国际威信和国内社会主义改造方面所采取的大胆而忠于原则的政策。”
    汪戴尔大使热情地祝愿中德两国之间的友谊更进一步地巩固和发展。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上讲话，代表中国政府和中国人民，向德意志民主共和国政府和德意志人民，表示热烈的祝贺。他说：“九年来，德意志民主共和国人民在社会主义建设中获得了巨大的成就，现在正在为实现第二个五年计划进行着忘我的劳动。今年7月举行的德国统一社会党第五次代表大会提出了在短短的历史时期内完成社会主义建设的任务。这一伟大号召的实现，不仅将大大促进德意志民主共和国经济和文化的高涨，而且将进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。”
    陈毅副总理说：“德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营的西方屏障。是防止美国侵略者在欧洲发动新战争的重要力量。德意志人民对于巩固欧洲和平，对于在和平、民主的基础上统一自己的祖国，进行了坚持不懈的斗争。今年9月5日，德意志民主共和国政府向苏、美、英、法四国政府，提出了要求缔结对德和约的照会，同时建议西德政府共同合作，为和平谈判进行必要的准备工作。虽然这个新的努力又一次遭到了美国和西德等国政府的无理拒绝，但是它必将得到越来越多的德意志人民和世界各国人民的支持。中国政府和中国人民完全支持德意志民主共和国的这项建议，并且深信，英勇的德意志人民一定能够使他们的祖国成为一个统一的、民主的、爱好和平的国家！”
    他强调说：“中德两国是社会主义阵营大家庭中同年同月诞生的兄弟国家。几年来，我们两国人民的友好合作关系已经有了很大的发展。我们两国在维护世界和平的斗争中不断地加强着相互的支持。今后随着两国社会主义建设事业的突飞猛进，我们两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊一定会得到进一步的发展，我们两国在各方面的互助合作也一定会更加紧密。”
    陈毅副总理在讲话中还重申了中国人民在台湾问题上的立场，并且感谢德国人民在中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中所给予的兄弟般的同情和支持。
    充满友谊的招待会共进行了两个小时。在大使的客人中，还有中国各方面的人士和各国驻中国的使节。
