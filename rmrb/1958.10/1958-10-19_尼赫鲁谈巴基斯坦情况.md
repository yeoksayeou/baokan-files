Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 18th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a public gathering in Mount Abu, Rajasthan, on the evening of the 17th that it was strange that some major powers refused to recognize China.

He said it was a ridiculous thing that the United Nations could not see the actual situation.

Speaking about the situation in Pakistan, Nehru said that Pakistan had abolished its constitution and announced martial law. The events that occurred there clearly showed that the country had been established for twelve years but could not settle down and function normally.

He added that he had no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of neighboring countries when expressing these views. He hoped that the people of Pakistan would be happy.

    尼赫鲁谈巴基斯坦情况
    新华社新德里18日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁17日晚间在拉贾斯坦邦阿布山地方举行的一个公众集会上说，一些大国拒不承认中国，令人感到奇怪。
    他说，联合国看不见实际情况，这是一件滑稽的事情。
    在谈到巴基斯坦局势时，尼赫鲁说，巴基斯坦废除了宪法，公布了军事戒严令，那里发生的事件清楚地表明，这个国家建立了十二年，还不能安定下来和正常地活动。
    他又说，他发表这些看法时，无意干涉邻国内政。他希望巴基斯坦人民幸福。
