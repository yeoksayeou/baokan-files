    My Master
    Li Songxian, Factory Electrician, Jiangxi Labor Bureau Technical School
    The militia regiment finished their exercises, and I rushed into the canteen in a panic. Looking up, the electric clock on the wall already showed 7:40. According to my master's rules, even if I didn't eat, I would still be late. Every day at work, if you didn't arrive half an hour early, he would do all the preparatory work for you. When you arrived, he would gently say:
  "Eh! Why come so early? Afraid of being at a disadvantage? Quickly sit down and rest!" These few non-committal words often made me feel so bad I wanted to cry! Thinking of this, I didn't bother to sit down and eat, but squeezed into the crowd, bought a few steamed buns, and ran towards the workshop.
    When I entered the workshop, my master saw me but didn't say a word, just rolled his eyes at me.
    "Master, today I am...".
    "Shut up!" Before I could finish, my master got angry. "What are you? To be honest, I didn't blame you much for being late in the past. Today, I feel sad in my heart that you are late... Xiao Li, you are not young anymore! Haven't you seen what time it is now? The Chiang gang is using American missiles to shoot down our planes. American imperialism is directly infringing on our airspace and sea ten or twenty times! They are bullying us like this, don't you have any anger?" I lowered my head, and my master swallowed and said, "The Party now wants us to make great efforts in steel production. This is competing with imperialism! Now is a time when every second counts! Xiao Li, why aren't you moved at all?"
    Hearing my master's words, I was so moved that I almost wanted to jump into his arms. I quickly explained softly, "Master, you don't know, I didn't deliberately come late today. Everyone is the same, because we participated in militia training!"
    "Militia?" My master exclaimed, "When did you participate? How come I don't know?"
    "Because you are old, we didn't notify you to attend the meeting."
    "Ah!" "I said, we talk about 'everyone a soldier' every day! Why isn't there any movement here?" Suddenly, he frowned and said, "Oh! Xiao Li, don't be like me, I was too rude just now... In the future, then don't rush to do preparatory work, I will do it for you. You can rest assured and train well! That is also work!"

    我的师傅
    江西劳动局技工学校工厂电工　李松贤
    民兵团收了操，我慌地跑进食堂，抬头一看，墙上的电钟已经七点四十分了。按我师傅的规矩，就是不吃饭，也算迟到了。每天上班，你若不提前半小时去，那他就会把一切准备工作替你作好。等你到了，他就轻轻地说：
  “咦！来这么早弄啥？不怕吃亏么？快坐那休息休息吧！”这几句不痛不痒的话，常常使我难过的要哭！想到这里，我顾不得坐下吃饭，只挤进人群买了几个馒头啃着便往车间里跑。
    进了车间，师傅见了我，一句话也没有说，只是翻了我一眼。
    “师傅，今天我是……”。
    “住口！”没等我说完，师傅就火起来了。“你是怎么？说实在话，你过去迟到，我都不怎么怪你。今天迟到，我心里感到难过。……小李，你不小啦！你就没看看今天到了啥时期啦？蒋贼用美国导弹，打我们的飞机。美帝直接十次二十次的侵犯我们的海空！它们这样欺侮我们，你就没一点怒气吗？”我低着头，师傅咽了口吐沫又说：“党现在要我们大炼钢铁，这就是跟帝国主义争胜负的呀！现在是分秒必争的时候呀！小李，你为啥没一点感动呢？”
    听师傅这一番话，我感动的几乎想扑到他怀里去。我忙轻声解释道：“师傅你不知道，今天我不是故意来晚的。大家都一样，因为我们参加了民兵训练！”
    “民兵？”师傅惊叫一声：“什么时候参加的？我怎么不知道？”
    “因为你年纪大了所以没通知你去开会。”
    “啊！”“我说，天天说‘全民皆兵’哩！我们这里为啥没动静呢？”忽然，他皱起眉头说：“咳！小李，别跟我一样，刚才我太粗莽了……以后，那你就别急着来作准备工作了，我会替你作好。你放心操练好啦！那也是工作嘛！”
