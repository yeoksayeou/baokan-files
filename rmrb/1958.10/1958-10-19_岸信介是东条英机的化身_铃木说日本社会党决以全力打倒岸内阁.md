Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th -- Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said at the party's Central Committee meeting today: "The Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is the second Tojo Cabinet, and Kishi Nobusuke is the incarnation of Hideki Tojo. Japan is currently in a state of emergency. The people should reorganize all struggles based on this understanding and devote all their strength to overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet."

When talking about the international situation, Suzuki said that the world is now harboring the crisis of a nuclear weapons war, and the United States is lagging behind the Soviet Union in terms of atomic warfare capabilities, so it is showing anxiety. He said that this is very dangerous.

Suzuki called on the Japanese people to make efforts, cooperate with peace-loving people all over the world, and not get involved in war.

Suzuki pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet had repeatedly made suggestions to the United States on the issue of revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," but the United States demanded that Kishi Nobusuke strengthen the "Self-Defense Forces," send troops abroad, and organize the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" as conditions. The fact that the United States has now accepted the request to revise the treaty shows that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet has accepted the conditions of the United States and undertaken major obligations. Suzuki pointed out that in order to obstruct the Japanese people's counterattack against its conspiracy to revise the "Security Treaty," the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is attempting to forcibly implement reactionary measures such as the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" and the "Performance Evaluation" system.

Suzuki pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's talk to NBC reporter Brown was merely announcing to this American reporter in advance what he would have to announce to the Japanese people sooner or later.

Suzuki stated that the Socialist Party is determined to fight alongside the Japanese people.

Suzuki also stated that he would thoroughly investigate the corruption cases of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The Socialist Party began a two-day Central Committee meeting in Tokyo today. The meeting will focus on mobilizing the strength of the entire party and preparing for struggles inside and outside the Diet in order to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet. The meeting will also condemn the Kishi Nobusuke government for implementing the "Performance Evaluation" system, revising the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," and pursuing policies that are hostile to the Chinese people.

    岸信介是东条英机的化身
    铃木说日本社会党决以全力打倒岸内阁
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎今天在这个党的中央委员会会议上说：“岸信介内阁是第二个东条内阁，岸信介就是东条英机的化身。日本目前正处于非常状态。国民应该根据这样的认识来重新安排一切斗争，拿出全部力量来打倒岸信介内阁。”
    铃木在谈到国际局势的时候说，现在，世界正包藏着核武器战争的危机，美国在原子战争力量方面落后于苏联，因此表现出焦急的情绪。他说，这是很危险的事情。
    铃木要求日本人民进行努力，同全世界爱好和平的人民实行合作，不要卷进战争里去。
    铃木指出，岸信介内阁曾经屡次就修改日美“安全条约”的问题向美国提出建议，但是美国要以岸信介增强“自卫队”、派兵出国和组织“东北亚条约组织”为条件。美国这一次接受了修改条约的要求，说明岸信介内阁已经接受了美国的条件，承担了重大的义务。铃木指出，岸信介内阁为了阻挠日本人民对它修改“安全条约”的阴谋的反击，正在企图强迫实施“警察官职务执行法修正案”和“勤务评定”制度等反动措施。
    铃木指出，岸信介向美国全国广播公司记者布朗发表的谈话，只不过是把迟早不得不向日本人民宣布的事情预先向这位美国记者发表而已。
    铃木表示，社会党决心同日本人民一起进行斗争。
    铃木还表示要对岸信介政府的贪污案件进行彻底追查。
    社会党今天在东京开始举行为期两天的中央委员会会议，会议将特别着重讨论发挥全党的力量，作好在国会内外进行斗争的准备工作，以便打倒岸信介内阁；会议还将就反对岸信介政府实施“勤务评定”制度、修改“警察官职务执行法”和它奉行敌视中国人民等政策进行谴责。
