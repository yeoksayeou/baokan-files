North Korea Vigorously Develops Electric Power Industry
    Expected Annual Power Generation to Reach 20 Billion Kilowatt-hours in Six to Seven Years
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, rich in electrical power resources, plans to produce 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually within 6-7 years in order to promote the electrification of the country.
    According to the directives of the First Five-Year People's Economic Plan (1957-1961), the renovation project of the Sup'ung Dam, with a generating capacity of 700,000 kilowatts, has been completed, and the construction projects of the Turujian Hydropower Station, with a generating capacity of 90,000 kilowatts, and the Jiangjie Youth Hydropower Station, with a generating capacity of 246,000 kilowatts, are underway. Recently, construction has begun on a large hydropower station, the Unbong Power Station, with a generating capacity of 600,000 kilowatts. To build this hydropower station, a dam is to be built on the middle reaches of the Yalu River, the largest river in Korea.
    The construction of this hydropower station will involve 800,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work, and the construction of an 800-meter-long dam, which will require the pouring of 3 million cubic meters of concrete. After the dam is completed, it will form a large reservoir of more than 17,000 square kilometers.
    This hydropower station is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 1962. During this period, other hydropower station projects under construction and the Pyongyang Thermal Power Plant, with a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts, as well as many small and medium-sized hydropower station projects, will also be completed.
    In the near future, when the average electricity production per capita in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reaches 2,000 kilowatts, it will be one of the countries with the most abundant electricity in the world, catching up with or surpassing the 1955 levels of Britain, France, and Japan.

    朝鲜大力发展电力工业
    预计六七年内年产电力达二百亿度
    本报讯　电力资源丰富的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，为了促进国家的电气化要在6—7年之内年产电力二百亿度。
    根据第一个五年人民经济计划（1957年—1961年）的指令，已经完成发电能力达七十万瓩的水丰发电站改建工程，并正在进行着发电能力达九万瓩的秃鲁江水电站和发电能力达二十四万六千瓩的江界青年水电站建设工程。最近开始兴建一所发电能力达六十万瓩的大水电站——云峰发电站；为了修这个水电站，要在朝鲜最大的江——鸭绿江的中游上修堰堤。
    为建设这个水电站，要进行八十万立方公尺土方和石方作业，修一道长八百公尺堰堤，这道堰堤要浇灌混凝土三百万立方公尺。在修好这道堰堤之后，就可以形成一座一万七千多平方公里的大水库。
    这所水电站将在1962年上半年竣工。在这个期间，还要完成正在兴建中的其他水电站工程和发电能力达十万瓩的平壤火力发电站，以及许多中小规模的水电站工程。
    在不久将来，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国每个人口平均的电力产量要达到二千瓩时，这将是世界上电力最丰富的国家之一，而赶上或是超过英国、法国、日本1955年的水平。（附图片）
