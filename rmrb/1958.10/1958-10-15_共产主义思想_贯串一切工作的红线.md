    Communist Ideology -
    The Red Line Running Through All Work
    The "Study" magazine, published on October 10th, featured an article by Chi Liaozhou entitled "Promoting Communist Ideology." The article states that an important task of the Party's propaganda and education work in the future is to correctly and practically explain the issues of accelerating socialist construction and transitioning to communism to the people of the whole country, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas." To treat the promotion of communist ideology as a guiding principle, or, as a red line, running through all work. From the content of this resolution, the most fundamental characteristics of communism are: first, abundant products, and second, high ideals; and the most important means to achieve these goals are labor and education. To enable social products to be greatly enriched, the most important issue is to thoroughly liberate the productive forces and to ensure that all people with labor capacity in society engage in labor within their capabilities. Understanding communism from the perspective of labor allows us to more deeply understand why the Party Central Committee so emphasizes cadres participating in physical labor, intellectuals going to the countryside and mountains for labor training, education being integrated with productive labor, and the thorough liberation of women from tedious housework, etc., all for the sake of realizing a communist society where everyone engages in labor. Emphasizing physical labor is also for the sake of better integrating physical and mental labor. Voluntary labor, labor without quotas, labor without expecting rewards, and labor without conditions for remuneration should become our slogans for promoting communist ideology.
    The article says that another important issue in promoting communism is the gradual elimination of the remnants of bourgeois right and the thorough overcoming of bourgeois ideology of right. "To each according to his work" has its progressive role in a certain historical stage. However, this principle is also a temporary compromise and concession to the remnants of bourgeois right. This means that in the socialist stage, the remnants of bourgeois right are not some immutable principle that cannot be touched at all. For example, piece-rate wage systems, royalty systems, various forms of bonus systems, the salary grade system for cadres, and other things such as patriarchal systems, and old enterprise management systems, can and should be gradually reformed or eliminated. Narrow views that reflect the remnants of bourgeois right, that is, the bourgeois ideology of right, must be immediately and thoroughly criticized and overcome.

    共产主义思想——
    贯串一切工作的红线
    10月10日出版的“学习”杂志第十九期发表了迟蓼洲写的一篇题为“宣传共产主义思想”的文章。文章说，党的宣传教育工作今后的一项重要任务，就是要根据党中央“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”的精神，向全国人民正确地联系实际地解释关于加速社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡的问题。把宣传共产主义思想，当作一个纲，或者说，作为一条红线把一切工作贯串起来。从这个决议的内容看来，共产主义最基本的特点：一是产品多，二是思想高；而实现这目标的最重要的手段，就是劳动和教育。要使社会产品能够极大地丰富起来，最主要的问题是彻底解放劳动力，使社会上所有有劳动力的人都进行力所能及的劳动。从劳动出发来理解共产主义，我们就可以更深刻地懂得，党中央为什么那么强调干部参加体力劳动，知识分子下乡上山进行劳动锻炼，教育必须和生产劳动相结合，把妇女从繁琐家务中彻底解放出来，等等，是为着实现一个人人都进行劳动的共产主义社会。强调体力劳动，也是为着能够更好地使体力劳动和脑力劳动密切地结合起来。自愿的劳动，无定额的劳动，不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动应该成为我们宣传共产主义思想的口号。
    文章说，宣传共产主义中的另一个重要问题，就是关于逐步消灭资产阶级法权残余和彻底克服资产阶级法权思想的问题。“按劳取酬”在一定历史阶段，是有其进步作用的。但是，这个原则，也是对资产阶级法权残余的一种暂时的妥协和让步。这也就是说，在社会主义阶段，资产阶级法权残余并不是根本动不得的一种什么固定不变的原则。例如，对计件工资制、稿酬制度、多种名目的奖金制度、干部的工资级别制度以及其他如家长制、旧企业的管理制度，都是可以而且应该逐步加以改革或消灭的。对于反映资产阶级法权残余的狭隘观点，即资产阶级法权思想，必须立即进行彻底地批判和克服。
