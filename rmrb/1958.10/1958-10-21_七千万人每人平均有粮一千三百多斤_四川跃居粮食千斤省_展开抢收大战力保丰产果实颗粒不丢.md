Our Chengdu dispatch of the 20th: (Reporters Yu Jingqi and Sun Yuedong) Sichuan Province has organized a field combat corps of over ten million people, launching a final rush harvest battle, determined to bring in all the fruits of the abundant harvest.

This year, Sichuan's total grain output is expected to reach 96 billion catties, an increase of 106% over last year, with an average yield of 1,020 catties per mu, leaping to the forefront as a province with 1,000 catties per person. The province's more than 70 million people have an average of 1,333 catties of grain per person, exceeding the target for increased production set in the National Agricultural Development Program for 1967, nine years ahead of schedule. Total cotton production is also expected to reach 3.24 million dan, an increase of 131% over last year. Currently, more than 50 billion catties of grain have been harvested, with nearly half of the grain and cotton still in the fields, urgently awaiting harvest.

Now, a magnificent scene of rushing the harvest is unfolding between the mountains and rivers of Sichuan. In the terraced fields, there are crowds of people during the day and bright lights at night. The rush harvest army, mainly composed of women, is waving scythes and turning threshing machines, busily rushing to harvest the late rice. At the same time, hundreds and thousands of specialized teams are rushing to dig sweet potatoes and pick cotton in the mountains and fields. In the high mountain area of Pengshui County, the secretary takes the lead, with Party members and Youth League members as vanguards, leading the masses to rush harvest crops. The masses sing loudly: "Regardless of whether it is dark or light, as long as the grain is harvested, we are willing to shed thousands of drops of sweat to prevent the grain from rotting." The deep plowing teams in sweet potato producing areas generally use one set of personnel for two purposes, deep plowing while digging sweet potatoes, speeding up the progress of digging sweet potatoes. Neijiang Prefecture dug and harvested a quarter of the prefecture's three million mu of sweet potatoes in less than ten days.

Rushing the harvest requires overcoming ideological obstacles. Initially, how to rush harvest the ripened crops did not attract the attention of all farmers. Some people said: "Take your time, what's the rush? In previous years, sweet potatoes were dug after the frost, there is still plenty of time." Some people believe that most of the main labor force has been transferred to steelmaking, and with fewer people, they can't handle it, and being anxious and busy won't help. Some people also look down on women and semi-laborers, saying that they can't do much work. In order to strengthen ideological work for rushing the harvest, many places launched small rectification campaigns. Longchang County criticized the "labor difficulty theory" through debate. Everyone contributed ideas, tapped potential, and came up with solutions. The whole county implemented collectivization, militarization, and combatization, going to work early and returning late, with men, women, old, and young all participating, unearthing more than 20,000 women's and children's labor potential, basically overcoming the labor shortage. The Zhouxing Commune originally calculated that only over a thousand people in the commune were engaged in rushing the harvest, and it would take a month to harvest everything. Through labor accounting, tapping potential, and rational organization, the actual number of people participating in rushing the harvest in this commune has now reached more than 4,500, and the harvest was completed in just three days.

All localities have formed various combat regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and specialized combat groups, and have been promptly put into battle. Xichong County mobilized 250,000 laborers, divided into two major armies for deep plowing and sweet potato digging and autumn planting, using more than 13,000 sweet potato digging plows, combined with deep plowing plows, and organized 10,000 rush harvest teams to contract for all the tasks of digging sweet potatoes, carrying sweet potatoes, transporting sweet potatoes, and deep plowing sweet potato fields. Within a few days, they dug sweet potatoes and deep plowed 30,000 mu. The Ciyun Brigade of the Lishi Commune in Jiangjin County mobilized more than 1,600 people, forming more than 150 combat groups with threshing machines and mixing buckets as the center. Each group has eight to twelve commune members, young and strong women threshing grain, those with slightly weaker physical strength cutting grain, the elderly and weak drying grain, and children carrying grain. The labor force is properly matched, so that the harvesting work of the whole team is carried out quickly and well. In Suining, Nanchong, and other places, many urban residents, industrialists, businessmen, government cadres, and school teachers have also suspended business and taken holidays to help farmers rush the harvest.

In order to ensure "a bountiful harvest," "a ten percent yield, a ten percent harvest, without losing a single grain," many places have reformed harvesting tools and improved harvesting methods. Some counties cut off the rice ears when harvesting grain and transport them back to the drying yard for harvesting and threshing, minimizing spillage.

    七千万人每人平均有粮一千三百多斤
    四川跃居粮食千斤省
    展开抢收大战力保丰产果实颗粒不丢
    本报成都20日电　记者于竞祁、孙跃冬报道：四川省组织了一千多万人的田野战斗兵团，展开最后抢收大战，决心把丰产果实全部拿到手里。
    今年四川全省粮食总产量预计可达到九百六十亿斤，比去年增产106％，平均亩产一千零二十斤，一跃而为千斤省。全省七千多万人口，平均每人有粮一千三百三十三斤，提前九年超额完成了全国农业发展纲要规定的1967年的增产指标。棉花总产量也可达到三百二十四万担，比去年增产131％。目前，已收回粮食五百多亿斤，还有将近一半的粮食和棉花在地里急待收获。
    现在，一幅宏伟的抢收图景，在巴山蜀水之间展开。层层的梯田里，白天人山人海，晚上灯火通明，以妇女为主力的抢收大军，挥动着镰刀、转动着打谷机，紧张地抢收晚稻。与此同时，成百成千的专业队正在山野里抢挖红苕、摘棉花。彭水县高山区的群山社，书记挂帅，党团员打先锋，带领群众抢收庄稼。群众高唱：“不管天黑和天亮，只要粮食抢收光，我们愿流千滴汗，不让粮食遭霉烂。”红苕产区的深耕队，普遍作到一套人马两使用，边深耕，边挖苕，加快了挖苕进度。内江专区不到十天就挖收了全区三百万亩红苕的四分之一。
    抢收要过思想关。起初，如何抢收成熟了的庄稼，并没有引起所有农民的重视。有人说：“慢慢来，忙什么，往年都是过了霜降才挖红苕，时间还早哩。”有的人认为，主要劳动力大都调去炼钢铁，人少搞不过来，再急再忙也不抵事。有的人还看不起妇女和半劳动力，说他们做不了什么活路。为了加强抢收的思想工作，许多地方展开了小整风。隆昌县通过辩论批判了“劳力困难论”。人人献计、挖潜力、想办法，全县实行了集体化、军事化、战斗化，早出工，晚收工，男女老少齐出动，共挖掘出妇女、儿童劳动潜力二万多个，基本克服了劳力困难。周兴公社原来计算全社只有一千多人投入抢收，要一个月才能收光；通过劳力算账、挖潜力、合理组织，现在这个社实际参加抢收的人数已达四千五百多人，只三天就抢收完了。
    各地都组成各种战斗团、营、连、排和专业战斗组，及时投入战斗。西充县出动二十五万个劳动力，分成深耕挖苕和秋种两路大军，以一万三千多个挖苕犁，配合深耕犁，组织一万个抢收队，包干挖苕，背苕、运苕和苕地深耕等全部活路，几天之内就挖苕和深耕三万亩。江津县李市公社慈云大队，动员了一千六百多人，以打谷机和拌桶为中心，组成一百五十多个战斗小组，每组有八至十二个社员，年轻力壮的妇女打谷子，体力稍差的割谷子，老年人和体力弱的晒谷子、儿童背谷子，劳动力搭配恰当，使全队收割工作进行得又快又好。遂宁、南充等地许多城镇居民、工商业者、机关干部、学校师生，也都停业放假，帮助农民抢收。
    为了保证“丰产丰收”、“十成产，十成收，不丢一颗，不掉一粒”，许多地方改革收割工具，改进收割方法。有的县收谷时将稻穗割下，运回晒场上收打，尽量减少抛撒。
