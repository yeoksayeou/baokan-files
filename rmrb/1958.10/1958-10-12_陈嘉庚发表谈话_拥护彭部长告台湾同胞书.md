Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, issued a statement regarding Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's letter to compatriots in Taiwan, saying:

　　I fully endorse the letter to compatriots in Taiwan issued by Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai. Minister Peng Dehuai's message continues the spirit of Premier Zhou's call of several years ago, suggesting negotiations to achieve a peaceful resolution, to end the civil war between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek group, that is, to end the suffering endured by the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu islands in recent years. This is not only humanitarianism, but also a call for great patriotism. The people of the whole country support this great call, and all patriotic overseas Chinese also support this great call. I hope that the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu islands will also rise up urgently to support this great call.

　　American imperialists are our common enemy. We cannot allow them to act wantonly in our territory, territorial waters, and airspace. We must drive them away, and we will certainly be able to drive them away.

    陈嘉庚发表谈话
    拥护彭部长告台湾同胞书
    新华社11日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚就国防部彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话说：
    我完全拥护国防部长彭德怀发表的告台湾同胞书。彭德怀部长的文告是继周总理几年前的号召的精神，建议举行谈判实行和平解决，来结束中国人民与蒋介石集团之间的内战，也就是结束台、澎、金、马岛上的军民同胞几年来所遭受的苦难。这不但是人道主义，而且是伟大的爱国主义的号召。全国人民支持这一伟大号召，全体爱国华侨也支持这一伟大号召。我希望台、澎、金、马军民同胞们也应急起拥护这一伟大的号召。
    美帝国主义者是我们共同的公敌。我们不能容许他们在我们的领土、领海、领空作威作恶，我们必须把他们赶走，我们也一定能把他们赶走。
