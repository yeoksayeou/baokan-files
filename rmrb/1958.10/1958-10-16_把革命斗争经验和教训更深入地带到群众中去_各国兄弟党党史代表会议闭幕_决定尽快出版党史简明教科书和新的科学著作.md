The meeting opened on October 7th. The meeting discussed issues related to researching the history of Communist and Workers' Parties and compiling teaching materials, as well as issues related to scientifically summarizing the experience accumulated in the history of the international workers' movement and the communist movement. Representatives of the parties of various countries spoke at the meeting, talking about the situation of various parties in researching their own national party history, the history of the international workers' movement, and the communist movement, and put forward suggestions.

Arnold, Director of the Marxist-Leninist Institute of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, gave a concluding speech. He said that Marxist party history workers will bring the experience and lessons of the international proletarian revolutionary struggle more deeply to the masses, so as to complete the important tasks put forward to the world communist movement by the Moscow Declaration last year. He emphasized that this meeting clearly demonstrated the close cooperation of fraternal parties in socialist and capitalist countries in the research work of the history of the world communist movement.

The meeting unanimously decided that the next meeting of representatives will be held in Bucharest in August next year, and the agenda will include: 1.

    把革命斗争经验和教训更深入地带到群众中去
    各国兄弟党党史代表会议闭幕
    决定尽快出版党史简明教科书和新的科学著作
    新华社柏林15日电　各国共产党和工人党马克思列宁主义研究院党史代表会议历时八天，于14日在柏林闭幕。
    会议通过的决议指出，这次会议的参加者在科学地研究共产党和工人党历史的问题上取得了完全一致的意见。鉴于资产阶级历史学家和修正主义者加紧了对科学共产主义的进攻，决议认为，各国党史研究机构今后三、四年的工作任务是：尽快出版党史简明教科书，出版新的科学著作，以便用无产阶级国际主义精神教育群众，并批判资产阶级混淆历史；出版一部共产国际文献集，以迎接共产国际成立四十周年；准备关于第一国际活动的文集；发表阐述国际工人运动杰出领袖的作用的专论等。
    这次会议是10月7日开幕的。会议讨论了有关研究共产党和工人党的历史和编辑教材的问题，以及有关科学地总结国际工人运动和共产主义运动史方面所积累的经验问题。参加会议的各国党的代表先后在会上发了言，谈到了各国党研究本国党史、国际工人运动和共产主义运动史的情况，并且提出了建议。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会马克思列宁主义研究院院长阿诺德最后作了总结发言。他说，马克思主义的党史工作者将把国际无产阶级革命斗争的经验和教训更深入地带到群众中去，这样来完成去年莫斯科宣言给世界共产主义运动提出的重要任务。他强调指出，这次会议清楚地表明了社会主义国家和资本主义国家的兄弟党在世界共产主义运动史的研究工作方面携手合作。
    会议最后一致决定，下一次代表会议将于明年8月在布加勒斯特举行，议程将包括：一、各国共产党和工人党争取工人阶级统一的斗争；二、历史科学在反修正主义斗争中的任务。
