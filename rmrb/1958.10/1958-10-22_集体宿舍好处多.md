Collective Dormitories Have Many Advantages (Clapper Talk)

Yangquan No. 3 Mine Electrical and Mechanical Worker Li Shaohua

The bamboo clappers sound, echoing in the sky,
Let's talk about the benefits of collective living,
In the past, residence was scattered and not concentrated,
Various things could not be done,
You went east, I went west,
It was not easy to concentrate.
Since collective living,
The various advantages are countless.
Eating and living together,
Military organization is very easy to achieve,
And working to liberate Taiwan is guaranteed.
Eating and living together,
Collective study is really convenient,
When the teacher's whistle blows,
All the students arrive.
Eating and living together,
Subscribing to newspapers and periodicals for study,
Put together, there are quite a few,
The dormitory is also a library.
Eating and living together,
Cultural and sports activities are lively,
Playing basketball, doing gymnastics,
Horizontal bars, parallel bars, short and long runs,
Entertainment time is really active,
Everyone dances together,
Self-composed songs we sing ourselves,
Leap Forward songs resound through the sky.
Eating and living together,
We learn from each other,
Comparing red and expert, comparing practical,
Planting red flags and cutting down white flags,
Mutual understanding is deep,
Unity surpasses kinship.
Leaders and masses live together,
Problems are discovered and dealt with,
The mass line is put into practice,
Getting rid of officialdom and lethargy.
Eating and living together,
Public health is paid attention to,
Everyone supervises each other,
The mobile red flag is the symbol,
Calling out to comrades, listen,
The advantages of collective dormitories are endless,
Everyone quickly engages in collectivism,
Communism will be built soon.

    集体宿舍好处多（快板）
    阳泉三矿机电工人　李绍华竹板打，响连天，集体住宿好处谈一谈，在过去居住分散不集中，各样事情办不成，你往东我往西，集中起来不容易。自从集体住宿后，各样好处说不清。饮食居住在一起，军事化实现很容易，又工作解放台湾有保证。饮食居住在一起，集体学习真便利，老师哨子一声响，全体学员都到齐。饮食居住在一起，订上报刊都学习，凑在一起真不少，宿舍也是图书室。饮食居住在一起，文体活动好热闹，打篮球，作体操，单杠双杠长短跑，娱乐时间真活跃，大家一起把舞跳，自编歌子自己唱，跃进歌声响彻九霄。饮食居住在一起，互相之间来学习，比红专，比实际，插上红旗砍白旗，互相之间了解深，团结赛过亲兄弟。领导群众住在一起，发现问题就处理，群众路线得实践，打掉官气和暮气。饮食居住在一起，公共卫生都注意，大家互相来监督，流动红旗是标志，叫同志，你们听，集体宿舍的好处说不清大家赶快搞集体，共产主义早建成。
