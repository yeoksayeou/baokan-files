    "Water Tank Furnace" and its Founder
    Comrade Zhou Shuigen, the director of Jiashan County Oil Pressing Factory in Zhejiang Province, is the founder of the Jiashan "Water Tank Furnace."
    In mid-August, the oil pressing factory decided to smelt iron, but they had no iron smelting equipment. Based on the factory's experience of using crock shards to build the "tip door" of the steamed bun oven, Zhou Shuigen had an idea: since crock shards are heat resistant, wouldn't it be possible to put two crocks together to make an iron smelting furnace? That day, he found two workers to work with him to build the furnace. After two days and nights of hard work, the first "Water Tank Furnace" was built. After being put into production, it smelted more than thirty catties of iron in one batch.
    The "Water Tank Furnace" was promoted throughout the county, and Zhou Shuigen became a "Water Tank Furnace doctor." In September, the furnace chamber of the "Water Tank Furnace" in Xitang Village froze, and they asked Zhou Shuigen to repair it. He saw that the furnace temperature had begun to drop sharply, so he ignored the intense heat and thick smoke and used an iron bar to chisel down from the top of the furnace. The heat inside the furnace made it difficult for him to breathe. He persevered until he had chiseled off the iron block that had formed inside the furnace. After repairing the furnace, he patiently explained to the workers the cause of the accident and how to prevent it.
    Zhou Shuigen has also explored some experiences to prolong the life of the furnace. Their factory's "Water Tank Furnace" can produce continuously for eight days and nights without needing repair. (Zhang Chunyuan) (Attached picture)

    “水缸炉”及其创始人
    浙江省嘉善县榨油厂厂长周水根同志，是嘉善“水缸炉”的创始人。
    8月中旬，榨油厂决定炼铁，但是没有炼铁设备。周水根根据厂里用缸片砌蒸饼炉“尖门”的经验，起了一个念头：缸片既然能耐火，把两只缸合拢起来作炼铁炉，不是也可以吗？当天，他就找了两个工人，同自己一起动手砌炉。苦战两昼夜，第一只“水缸炉”砌成了。投入生产后，一次就炼出了三十多斤铁。
    “水缸炉”在全县推广开了，周水根又当起了“水缸炉医生”。9月间，西塘村的“水缸炉”炉膛冻结了，请周水根去检修。他一看炉温已经开始急剧下降，就顾不得烈火浓烟，拿起铁条从炉顶上凿下去。炉里的热气，逼得他透不过气来。他坚持着，直到凿掉了结在炉内的铁块。修好炉子以后，他还耐心地向工人们讲解了发生事故的原因和防止的办法。
    周水根还摸索出了一些使炉子长寿的经验。他们厂的“水缸炉”能够连续生产八昼夜不必检修。　（张春元）（附图片）
