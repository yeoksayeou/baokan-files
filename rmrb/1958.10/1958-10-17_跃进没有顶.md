    The Great Leap Forward Has No Ceiling

    In Guangxi's Xincheng County, a mighty army of 70,000 people toiled for nineteen hours and produced over 670,000 tons of coal. In Hunan's Liling County, the Bali'ao People's Commune also achieved a daily coal output of over 20,000 tons. These are truly two inspiring "satellites."

    What is the driving force behind the launch of these two "satellites"? It is the masses, it is politics, it is communist ideology.

    Some people, after leaping forward one or two steps, feel they have reached the peak. After reading the news from Xincheng and Liling, these people should realize how far they have fallen behind. The Great Leap Forward has no peak, because the power of the millions of masses who have grasped communist ideology has no peak. After reading the news from Xincheng and Liling, who dares to say that he had long anticipated that the power of the masses would be so great? Those who are still shrinking back and shaking their heads in the face of the mass movement should quickly get on the horse and catch up! There are only places in the world where the masses have not been fully mobilized; there is absolutely no place where potential has been exhausted and production has reached its limit.

    跃进没有顶
    广西忻城县七万大军奋战十九个小时，生产了六十七万多吨煤，湖南醴陵县八里坳人民公社煤的日产量也达到了二万多吨，这真是两颗振奋人心的大卫星。
    发射这两颗大卫星的动力是什么？是群众，是政治，是共产主义思想。
    有些人跃进了一步两步，就觉得已经到了顶点。这些人读了忻城和醴陵的消息，应当觉悟到自己的落后。跃进是没有顶点的，因为掌握了共产主义思想的千百万群众的力量是没有顶点的。读了忻城和醴陵的消息，谁敢说他早就料到了群众的力量会有这样大？那些至今还在群众运动面前缩手摇头的人，赶快上马急追吧。世上只有群众没有充分发动的地方，绝没有潜力挖尽、生产到顶的地方。
