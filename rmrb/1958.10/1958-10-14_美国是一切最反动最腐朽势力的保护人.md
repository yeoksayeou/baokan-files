The U.S. imperialism's support for the reactionaries of various countries is a malicious means for it to realize its aggression plans and occupy many colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases. The puppet regimes fostered by the United States in the world, from the Far East to the Middle East, from Europe to Latin America, number no less than several dozen.

Li Seung-man, the Vanguard of the "Brink of War" Policy

How did Li Seung-man, who was praised by the United States as a "national hero" of Korea, ascend to the throne of "President"? According to historical records, it was like this: In 1945, with the arrival of the U.S. occupation army's luggage car in Korea, it brought Li Seung-man, a "U.S. citizen" who had spent half his life in Hawaii and Washington. In May 1948, Li Seung-man transplanted the American "democratic methods" to what he called the "wilderness area" of South Korea. In a congress protected by American bayonets, without the participation of voters, Li Seung-man was elected the first "President."

South Korea, known as the "granary of Korea," has been continuously plundered and destroyed economically under the reactionary rule of the United States and the Li Seung-man clique, and has become a land of hunger. According to South Korean news agencies, the United States has given South Korea $2.188 billion in "aid" in the past thirteen years. Among them, 76.7% are American surplus materials. The flooding of American surplus materials has overwhelmed South Korea's industry and agriculture. Most of South Korea's original factories have been squeezed out or forced to shut down. Its industrial output value is now only half of what it was during the period of Japanese imperialism's rule. The number of unemployed people has reached 1,135,000. The area of agricultural sowing has been reduced by 600,000 cho, and grain production has decreased by 40%. South Korea, which used to export several million stones (each stone is 150 kilograms) of grain every year before the American occupation, now imports 5 million stones of grain every year, and still, famine victims are everywhere.

Obviously, the United States is making every effort to support this Li Seung-man, who is extremely isolated in South Korea, not only because he is an eighty-year-old "American old citizen," but more importantly because he is the United States' "most loyal and reliable ally in the Far East."

In February 1950, MacArthur sent a telegram to Seoul, and Li Seung-man immediately flew to Tokyo. MacArthur ordered Li Seung-man to provoke the Korean civil war, and Li Seung-man immediately transferred his senior officers to Japan for training. Dulles boasted that South Korea was the "best springboard for attacking mainland China"; Li Seung-man immediately wrote on all the big stones on the 38th parallel: "Today the 38th parallel, tomorrow Changbai Mountain." After the Korean War was stopped by the pressure of the people of the world, the United States decided to violate the armistice agreement and instructed South Korea to expand its army and prepare for war. Li Seung-man immediately forcibly conscripted cannon fodder, increasing South Korea's army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to the current thirty-one divisions. ... In short, Li Seung-man's execution of orders from his American superiors has always been "immediate action" and always "exceeded expectations." And this is also what the United States is most satisfied with.

The Cleaner Ngo Dinh Diem Invading Vietnam

The United States' choice of Ngo Dinh Diem as the puppet prime minister of South Vietnam was by no means accidental. This old spy, who had been trained in Washington for nearly four years since 1950, was hurriedly put on the stage by the United States not long before the conclusion of the Geneva armistice agreement. His first action was to actively eliminate French influence and clear the way for the United States to fully control South Vietnam.

Despite the Geneva Accords stipulating that there should be no increase in troops, import of war materials, or establishment of military bases, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique openly violated them. Regarding the free elections for the reunification of Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Accords, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have consistently adopted delaying and denial tactics. Naturally, Ngo Dinh Diem's every word and deed is not determined by himself at all; look at how he is a parrot that follows his American master.

	Dulles: "Washington does not have a direct responsibility in Indochina under the Geneva Accords."
	Ngo Dinh Diem: "The South Vietnamese government did not sign the Geneva Accords, and it continues to refuse to recognize the provisions of this agreement."
	Dulles: "South Vietnam is a showcase of the 'free world' (the United States)."
	Ngo: "The borders of the United States have extended to the 17th parallel in Vietnam."

Perhaps some people think Ngo Dinh Diem's words are too extreme; unfortunately, the fact is indeed so. Today in South Vietnam, 2,000 American military advisers led by General Williams control all aspects of the South Vietnamese army's construction, training, command, base construction, and strategic highways. The "American Public Affairs Mission" headed by Barros deeply controls all departments of the South Vietnamese government. According to published figures, from 1955 to 1957, the United States gave South Vietnam a total of $750 million, which means that "U.S. aid" accounts for 40% of South Vietnam's fiscal budget. In fact, the "prestige" of U.S. aid far exceeds the figures it represents. It is reported that whenever South Vietnamese officials have different opinions from American advisers, as long as the American yells and slams the table saying "Who gave the money?" the matter will be dropped. No wonder an Indian journalist interviewing in South Vietnam couldn't help but ask: "I really don't know if the Americans live on Ngo Dinh Diem's territory, or Ngo Dinh Diem lives on American territory."

Hitler's Tool Becomes Wall Street's Loyal Servant

The most telling example of the nature of this U.S. policy of being hostile to the people of the world is its support for the Spanish dictator Franco.

Everyone knows that Franco is a bloodthirsty executioner. During the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, under Franco's butcher knife, the blood of one million Spanish Republican people was spilled all over the fields and pastures on the southern slopes of the Pyrenees. Franco was also a disciple of Hitler and Mussolini, a complete fascist. During World War II, he was the most resolute supporter of German and Italian fascism. During the war, Franco organized 470,000 cutthroats and hooligans into the "Blue Division" and sent them to the Eastern Front. When the Hitler bandits were defeated, Franco immediately took in 30,000 Nazis who had fled to Spain and gave them Spanish citizenship. ...

The war ended, Franco's teacher Mussolini was hanged in Milan by Italian patriots, and Hitler also committed suicide. Only he, still sitting in Madrid with a body full of blood debts. At that time, the U.S. State Department, in a white paper published in 1946, had to list evidence of Spain's support for German and Italian fascism during World War II; and agreed to the United Nations General Assembly's motion to boycott the Franco regime.

However, three years later, the U.S. fleet couldn't wait to sign an agreement and began using Spanish military bases under the pretext of a "friendly visit." In October of the following year, when the United Nations General Assembly's Special Committee discussed the Spanish issue, the United States openly disregarded the wishes of the people of the world and canceled the 1946 United Nations motion to boycott Franco.

Since then, the United States has made one dirty deal after another with Franco. In 1953, the United States bought Spain's sovereignty at the cost of $226 million in "aid," turning it into the Puerto Rico of the Mediterranean.

U.S. monopoly capital used the "U.S.-Spanish Agreement" to obtain "more preferential treatment in Spanish history than any country had ever enjoyed like the United States." Through the U.S.-Spanish military agreement, the United States established a 500-mile-long military base network in Spain. The United States' ambitions are not limited to these, and it is actively advocating the conclusion of a "Mediterranean Pact" including North African countries and Franco's Spain, extending its aggressive claws to African countries.

Franco went from being Hitler's tool to being a loyal servant of U.S. monopoly capital. Facing Spain's collapse and the people's increasingly strong opposition, Franco used concentration camps and torture to maintain his regime. It is estimated that today, nineteen years after the end of the civil war, at least 200,000 political prisoners are still in prison.

In this way, an extremely barbaric and dictatorial dictator is regarded by the United States as a partner in "defending culture, democracy, and peace"; not only strongly supporting him but even specifically allocating him 200 saber-type jet fighters to suppress the people's resistance.

The Old U.S. Lackey Batista

The U.S. support for the Cuban dictator Batista is another prominent example.

Some people in Cuba say: "Without the United States, not even a small leaf on the island of Cuba would dare to shake." This is a painful truth.

Batista is an old lackey of U.S. monopoly capital. As early as before World War II, he colluded with U.S. forces to launch a coup; in 1952, he was re-appointed as "President" by the United States and imposed on the Cuban people. In order to repay his U.S. masters, Batista opened the door to U.S. monopoly organizations, allowing the Cuban economy to be completely controlled by 200 U.S. companies. Since Batista came to power, U.S. companies have increased their investment in Cuba by $400 million, carrying out astonishing colonial plunder of Cuba. According to a report by the National Bank of Cuba, U.S. companies that invested a total of $800 million in Cuba have looted $750 million in wealth from the Cuban people in the past five years alone.

A regime that betrays national interests cannot but be resisted by the entire people. Therefore, Batista has always implemented a dictatorial rule. After he came to power, he abolished the constitution, dissolved the congress, canceled all democratic freedoms, and disbanded various democratic groups; although he announced the restoration of the constitution in 1955, he continued to persecute progressive forces. However, any fascist means are of no avail. With the guerrillas led by Castro joining the battle in November 1956, the Cuban people's struggle against Batista's reactionary rule has become increasingly massive, sweeping every corner of the country.

The situation in Cuba has made "the United States never feel so heavy-hearted," so it disregards the condemnation of all righteous people, provides Batista with a large amount of weapons and ammunition, and sends a military mission, openly interfering in the Cuban civil war. U.S. Congressman Powell revealed that the United States has jointly massacred 4,000 Cubans with Batista and burned countless villages. This blood debt is conclusive evidence that cannot be erased by any means. Cuban guerrillas have also released dozens of American soldiers; moreover, the incident in July this year when the U.S. Marine Corps attempted to land in Cuba under the pretext of "protecting the base's water source" is also obvious to all.

If you want to ask why the United States is so vicious and doesn't hesitate to further expose its aggressive face, the reason is very simple, just as the "New York Times" admitted: "Due to the large amount of investment in Cuba, sugar exports, and the strategic significance of Cuba."

Doing All Kinds of Bad Things Will Inevitably Be Besieged

From the above examples, it can be seen that although the United States differs in the specific use of these many traitorous puppets to serve its colonial interests: some focus on providing it with military bases and cannon fodder, creating international tensions, and implementing the "brink of war" policy, such as Li Seung-man and Ngo Dinh Diem; some mainly serve as tools for its colonial plunder, such as Batista; or both roles are combined, such as Franco. However, these puppets supported by the United States all have one thing in common: none of them are the most vicious enemies of their country's people; none of them are in an extremely isolated situation in their country. Why does the U.S. government insist on unreservedly supporting such mediocre, incompetent, and rotten guys? The fundamental "reason" is only one: since the U.S. government's aggressive policy violates the will of the people of so many countries and their national interests, the U.S. government cannot expect to get the cooperation of the people of these countries, and it cannot but arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, using military methods to establish a traitorous puppet regime that can "cooperate" with the U.S. government. Today, even in the United States, clear-sighted people have already felt that the fire is running underground, let's see what they are saying:

	South Korea "The forces opposing President Li Seung-man's long-term rule in South Korea are growing." ("United Press International")
	South Vietnam "The South Vietnamese people do not want to be people under American boots. An atmosphere of hostility surrounds everything with American marks." ("Vietnam Times")
	Spain "The people's dissatisfaction and desire for freedom are clamoring, rising higher and higher. The superficial tranquility is like boiling soup in a pot. Only because Franco is sitting on the top of the pot, the internal situation cannot be seen from the outside." ("New York Times")
	Cuba "For General Batista, every day is a crisis." ("U.S. News & World Report")

U.S. imperialism, as the protector of all the most reactionary and decadent forces in the world, its face has been exposed very clearly today. Precisely because of this, their lives will not be very long either, because the bad things they have done have forced all the oppressed people to rise up and attack them.

    美国是一切最反动最腐朽势力的保护人
    萧光
    美帝国主义扶植各国人民的反动派，是它实现侵略计划、霸占许多殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地的一个恶毒手段。美国在世界上所扶植的傀儡政权，从远东到中近东，从欧洲到拉丁美洲，前后总不下几十个。
    “战争边缘”政策的马前卒李承晚
    被美国捧为朝鲜“民族英雄”的李承晚，是怎样登上“总统”宝座的呢？按照历史的记载，是这样：1945年，随着美国占领军行李车的抵达朝鲜，带来了在夏威夷和华盛顿度过半生的“美国公民”李承晚。1948年5月，李承晚在他称之为南朝鲜“荒野的地区”上，移植了美国的“民主方式”。在没有选民参加的、美国刺刀保护下的国会里，李承晚当选了第一任“总统”。
    号称“朝鲜谷仓”的南朝鲜，在美国和李承晚集团的反动统治下，经济上不断遭到掠夺和破坏，已变成饥饿的土地。据南朝鲜通讯社统计，十三年来，美国给了南朝鲜二十一亿八千八百万美元的“援助”。其中76.7％是美国剩余物资。美国剩余物资的泛滥，冲垮了南朝鲜的工农业。南朝鲜原有的工厂大都被挤垮或是被迫停工。它的工业产值现今已减少到只有日本帝国主义统治时期的一半。失业的人达到一百一十三万五千。农业播种面积减少了六十万町步，粮食减产40％。在美国占领前每年都出口几百万石（每石一百五十公斤）粮食的南朝鲜，现在每年进口粮食五百万石，还是饥民遍野。
    显然，美国竭力支持这个在南朝鲜极端孤立的李承晚，不单因为他是一个八十多岁的“美国老公民”，更主要因为他是美国“在远东最忠实可靠的同盟者”。
    1950年2月，麦克阿瑟一个电报发到汉城，李承晚立刻就飞到了东京。麦克阿瑟命令李承晚必须挑起朝鲜内战，李承晚就立刻把他的高级将校调赴日本受训。杜勒斯夸南朝鲜是“进攻中国大陆最好的跳板”；李承晚就立刻把三八线所有的大石头都写上：“今天三八线，明天长白山。”朝鲜战争被全世界人民的压力制止以后，美国决意违反停战协定，指示南朝鲜扩军备战，李承晚就立刻强征炮灰，使南朝鲜的军队由停战时的十六个师增加到现在的三十一个师。……总之，李承晚执行美国上司的命令，从来都是“立刻行动”，从来都是“有过之无不及”。而这也是美国对他感到最满意的地方。	  侵入越南的清道夫吴庭艳
    美国选择吴庭艳担任南越的傀儡总理，也绝非出于偶然。这个自1950年起在华盛顿受了将近四年训练的间谍老手，于日内瓦停战协定缔结前的不久被美国匆匆捧上台后，第一个行动就是积极排除法国势力，为美国全面控制南越扫清道路。
    尽管日内瓦协议规定不得增援兵力、输入作战物资和建立军事基地等，美国和吴庭艳集团公然进行破坏。对于日内瓦协议规定的统一越南的自由选举，美国和吴庭艳集团一贯采取拖延和抵赖的态度。自然，吴庭艳的一言一行，完全不决定于自己；请看他是怎样一只追随美国主子的鹦鹉吧。
      杜勒斯：“华盛顿在印度支那并不负有根据日内瓦协议承担的
  直接责任。”
      吴庭艳：“南越政府没有在日内瓦协定签字，它继续拒绝承认
  这个协定的规定。”
      杜：“南越是‘自由世界’（美国）的橱窗。”
      吴：“美国的边界已伸延到越南的十七纬线。”
    也许有人以为吴庭艳这话说得太过火了；不幸，事实的确是这样。今天在南越，威廉斯将军领导的二千名美国军事顾问掌握着南越军队的建设、教练、指挥、修建基地和战略公路等各方面的一切大权。以巴罗斯为首的“美国公务代表团”深入控制着南越政府的各个部门。根据已公布的数字，自1955年到1957年，美国共给南越七亿五千万美元，这就是说“美援”在南越财政预算中占40％。而实际上，美援的“威风”却远远超过它所代表的数字。据报道，每逢南越官员与美国顾问有不同的意见，只要美国佬拍桌子大骂“谁给的钱”？问题就此不了了之。难怪一位在南越采访的印度记者，不禁发出这样的疑问：“真不知道是美国人生活在吴庭艳的领土上，还是吴庭艳生活在美国的领土上。”
    希特勒的工具变成华尔街的忠仆
    最能够表明美国这种与全世界人民为敌的政策本质的，莫过于它对于西班牙独裁者佛朗哥的支持了。
    谁都知道佛朗哥是一个满手血腥的刽子手。1936到1939年西班牙内战期间，在佛朗哥的屠刀下，一百万西班牙共和国人民的鲜血，洒遍了比利牛斯山南麓的原野和牧场。佛朗哥还是希特勒、墨索里尼的门徒，一个十足的法西斯头子。第二次世界大战中，他是德、意法西斯最坚决的支持者。大战期间，佛朗哥把刽子手和流氓组成了四十七万人的“蓝色师团”，派到东线作战。当希特勒匪徒被击败了的时候，佛朗哥又立刻收容了逃跑到西班牙去的三万纳粹分子，赐给他们西班牙公民的身份。……
    战争结束了，佛朗哥的老师墨索里尼被意大利爱国者在米兰吊死，希特勒也自杀了。只有他，带着一身血债照旧坐在马德里，当时，美国国务院在1946年发表的白皮书里，曾不得不列举第二次大战时西班牙支持德、意法西斯的证据；并同意联合国大会抵制佛朗哥政权的议案。
    可是，过了三年，美国舰队等不及签订协定，就借口“友谊访问”开始使用了西班牙的军事基地。第二年10月，在联合国大会特别委员会讨论西班牙问题的时候，美国公然蔑视世界人民的愿望，取消了1946年联合国抵制佛朗哥的议案。
    从此，美国同佛朗哥做成了一宗又一宗的肮脏交易。1953年，美国以二亿二千六百万美元“援助”的代价，收买到西班牙的主权，使它变成了地中海的波多黎各。
    美国垄断资本利用“美西协定”取得了“在西班牙历史中没有过任何一个国家享受像美国那么多的优待。”通过美西军事协定，美国在西班牙建立起一面长达五百哩的军事基地网。美国的野心还不止于这些，正极力鼓吹缔结一个包括北非国家和佛朗哥西班牙的“地中海公约”，把它的侵略魔爪伸向非洲国家。
    佛朗哥由希特勒的工具，变成了美国垄断资本的忠仆。面对着西班牙的崩溃和人民越来越强烈的反对，佛朗哥更加用集中营和酷刑拷打来维持他的政权。据估计，在内战结束十九年以后的今天，至少还有二十万名政治犯被关在监狱里。
    就这样，一个极端野蛮、专横的独裁者，却被美国看成是“保卫文化、民主与和平”的伙伴；不仅大力予以支持，甚至专门拨给他二百架佩刀式喷气机来镇压人民的反抗。
  美国的老牌走狗巴蒂斯塔
    美国对于古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔的扶植，是另一个突出的例子。
    古巴有人说：“如果没有美国，古巴岛上连一片小树叶都不敢抖动一下。”这是沉痛的实话。
    巴蒂斯塔是美国垄断资本的老牌走狗了，早在第二次大战以前，就曾勾结美国势力发动政变；1952年被美国再度封为“总统”，强加到古巴人民的头上。为了向美国主子报恩，巴蒂斯塔对美国垄断组织敞开大门，使古巴经济完全为二百家美国公司所操纵。美国公司自从巴蒂斯塔掌权以来，在古巴的投资增加了四亿美元；对古巴进行了惊人的殖民掠夺。据古巴国家银行的报告，总共在古巴投资八亿美元的美国公司，仅在近五年内就劫走了古巴人民七亿五千万美元的财富。
    这样一个出卖民族利益的政权，不能不遭到全民的反抗。所以巴蒂斯塔一向实行独裁统治，他上台后就废除宪法，解散国会，取消一切民主自由，解散各民主团体；1955年虽然宣布恢复宪法，但仍对进步势力继续迫害。只是，任何法西斯手段也无济于事。随着卡斯特罗领导的游击队1956年11月的投入战斗，古巴人民反抗巴蒂斯塔反动统治的斗争声势日益浩大，席卷了全国各个角落。
    古巴的局势使“美国的心情从来没有这样沉重过”，于是它不顾一切正义人们的谴责，大量供给巴蒂斯塔武器弹药，并且派出军事使团，公然干涉古巴内战。美国众议员鲍威尔揭露，美国已和巴蒂斯塔共同屠杀了四千名古巴人，焚毁无数村庄。这笔血债证据确凿，是任何手法也抹不掉的。古巴游击队也曾释放过几十名美国士兵；何况今年7月，美国海军陆战队借口“保护基地水源”企图在古巴登陆的事件，也是有目共睹的。
    若要问，美国为什么如此穷凶极恶，甚至不惜进一步暴露自己的侵略嘴脸？理由很简单，一切正像“纽约时报”承认的那样：“由于在古巴的大量投资、食糖出口和古巴的战略意义。”
  尽做坏事，必将遭到围攻
    从以上的例子可以看出，尽管美国在具体使用这许多卖国傀儡为它的殖民利益服务方面有所不同：有的着重为它提供军事基地和炮灰、制造国际紧张局势，贯彻“战争边缘”政策，如李承晚、吴庭艳；有的主要作为它进行殖民掠夺的工具，如巴蒂斯塔；或两种作用兼而有之，如佛朗哥。但是，美国扶植的这些傀儡，全有一个共同之点就是：没有一个不是他们国家人民最凶恶的敌人；没有一个在他们国内的处境不是万分孤立。美国政府为什么偏偏要毫无保留地支持这样一些昏庸无能、腐烂透顶的家伙呢？根本的“理由”只有一个：美国政府的侵略政策既然违反这许多国家人民的意志和它们的民族权益，美国政府就不可能指望得到这些国家人民的合作，就不可能不专横地干涉这些国家内政，用军事方法建立一个可以同美国政府“合作”的卖国傀儡政权。今天即使在美国，明眼的人们也已感到，地下的火在运行，请看他们是怎样说的：
    南朝鲜“反对李承晚总统在南朝鲜的长期统治的势力正在增长。”（“合众社”）
    南越“南越人民不愿做美国皮靴底下的人。在一切具有美国标记的东西周围，都笼罩着仇视的气氛。”（“越南时报”）
    西班牙“人民的不满情绪和追求自由的愿望正在喧腾，日益高昂。外表上的平静就像锅里沸汤。只因为佛朗哥坐在锅顶，内部的情形才不能为外间所见”（“纽约时报”）
    古巴“对于巴蒂斯塔将军来说，每天都是危机。”（“美国新闻与世界报道”）
    美帝国主义作为世界上一切最反动、最腐朽势力的保护人，它的面目今天已经暴露得十分清楚。正由于此，他们的寿命也不会很长了，因为他们所做的坏事，已迫使一切被欺负的人民群起而攻之。
