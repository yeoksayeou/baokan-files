    A Better Steelmaking Method
    —Henan’s Indigenous Reflection Furnace Steelmaking
    In the high tide of launching satellites in Zhengzhou City, several indigenous steelmaking methods emerged. Among them, the indigenous reflection furnace steelmaking method of the Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School in Henan Province has greater promotional value. This steelmaking method is based on the improvement of the indigenous steelmaking method in Weiyuan, Sichuan. The main improvements are the expansion of the coal-burning hearth and the improvement of the flue structure, which results in strong firepower, larger steel output per furnace, and faster steel tapping. The characteristic of this indigenous steelmaking method is low-temperature, colloidal-state steelmaking, which does not require high-temperature molten iron like the Western converter steelmaking method. Therefore, it does not rigidly require the silicon content of pig iron, nor does it need to add ferroalloys to aid combustion. It can adapt to various indigenous irons and scrap irons with inconsistent compositions, and it also breaks away from the dogma that so-called low-silicon iron (white cast iron) cannot be used for steelmaking.
    Because the characteristic of this steelmaking method is indirect heating by flame, rather than direct contact between fuel and steel, it can widely use various fuels such as bituminous coal, anthracite, coal briquettes, coal balls..., therefore, it can be adopted in places lacking wood and charcoal. The only requirement is that the sulfur content in the coal should be as low as possible to avoid adversely affecting the quality of the steel (becoming brittle during hot forging). This furnace uses mechanical blowing. If a bellows is used instead, it is estimated that a large bellows requiring several people to pull would be needed, which would require more manpower.
    This indigenous reflection furnace loads 100 to 180 jin of cold iron per furnace each time, and it takes about 90 minutes or less to refine one furnace of steel (excluding the time for hammering into blocks). Each furnace can produce about one ton of steel per day, and the quality of the steel produced is also good. According to analysis, the steel made from scrap iron and scrap pots with low silicon content (0.27%) and high sulfur and phosphorus content (sulfur 0.67%, phosphorus 0.63%) has a good composition: carbon 0.096%, silicon 0.1%, phosphorus 0.07%, sulfur 0.089%.
    Very few materials and equipment are needed to build this type of steelmaking furnace. Each furnace requires only 30 to 40 refractory bricks and 9 pig iron bars, in addition to the motor and blower. The rest are blue bricks, brick blanks, and yellow mud.
    Using this method, the ratio of steel to coal is one to one, or preferably two to one or three to one, which will greatly reduce coal consumption, and it is also possible to try hot charging. If there are small indigenous blast furnaces in the area, and hot molten iron can be directly used in the indigenous reflection furnace for steelmaking, it is estimated that coal consumption will be greatly reduced.
    Part of the inner cavity of the indigenous reflection furnace is lined with refractory materials. The inner wall of the coal-burning hearth is lined with a layer of refractory mud (one-quarter) and coke powder (three-quarters) mixture, which is both heat-resistant and non-stick to coal slag.
    The flue, the upper part of the coal-burning hearth (about 30 cm), and the area around the nozzle have the highest temperatures and require suitable refractory materials. Other parts can be built with adobe, blue bricks, or red bricks, using mud mortar. The outside of the furnace body is covered with yellow mud and straw to prevent air leakage.
    Blower: 2 to 3 horsepower, wind pressure 300 to 400 mm water column, air volume 8 to 10 cubic meters per minute.
    For the furnace charge for indigenous reflection furnace steelmaking, they have used the following three batching methods. One is all pig iron (both white cast iron and gray cast iron are acceptable), using iron with the lowest possible sulfur and phosphorus content. One is 82% pig iron, 12% iron ore, 6% limestone (for chemical analysis of the steel produced). Another is 93% pig iron, 3% iron ore, 4% limestone. The raw materials vary from place to place, so it is not possible to apply rigidly. Adding iron ore to the batch is as an oxidizing agent, and limestone is as a flux. Iron ore and limestone should not be added too much.
    Operating procedures: 1. Ignition: After igniting the coal-burning hearth with firewood, add a small amount of coal. After it ignites, put all the coal in (usually adding about 100 jin of coal), then add the cover, seal it, and blow air. If the temperature is not high enough during the smelting process, you can add coal midway, but you must do it quickly. 2. Charging: The time can be either early or late. According to the furnace type in the attached diagram, add all the iron material at once, 100 to 120 jin (the highest has been 188 jin). The iron blocks should not be too large; thin slices 5 to 6 cm, blocks 3 to 4 cm. Limestone and iron blocks are about 1 cm in size. 3. Heating: In the initial stage of heating, block the furnace mouth with an iron plate. There is no need to move the raw materials much. When it turns red and white, move the iron blocks around the edge with lower temperatures to the middle. 4. Stirring: When the iron material is fragmented or in a thick paste, the color changes from red to white. At this time, you need to stir it more, turning up the black material from the lower layer and turning it thoroughly. Pay special attention to preventing iron from sticking to the bottom at the back of the melting pool, so that the raw materials are evenly subjected to flame blowing. After several stirs, the iron particles turn white and the slag begins to flow. Continue to stir, and the number of stirs depends on the specific situation, generally stirring once every two to five minutes. If you see a lot of white sparks splashing out, you should reduce the air volume. If you see the melting pool boiling very violently and turning white, you should also reduce the air volume. After the raw materials become a sticky paste, stir twice more, then concentrate the steel material to the melting pool and stop stirring. However, the steel material must be loosened to promote ventilation. After about three minutes, when the steel particles stick together, you can prepare to tap the steel. 5. Tapping: Break the steel mass into blocks weighing about 5 to 15 jin. The size of the steel mass can be determined according to needs. After the steel mass is out of the furnace, quickly hammer it on a wooden anvil with a wooden hammer (or you can hammer it on an iron anvil with an iron hammer). Hammer quickly, otherwise the blank is prone to cracking. 6. After the steel is tapped, the slag must be removed clearly in preparation for the next furnace. The coal slag on the grate and walls of the coal-burning hearth should also be removed. (Attached pictures)

    一种比较好的炼钢法
    ——河南土法反射炉炼钢
    郑州市在大放卫星的高潮中，出现了几种土法炼钢方法，其中推广价值较大的是河南郑州农业机械化学校的土法反射炉炼钢，这种炼钢方法是在四川威远的土法炼钢基础上改进的。主要是扩大了烧煤炉膛、改善火道结构，从而使火力旺盛，每炉炼钢较多、出钢较快。这个土法炼钢方法的特点是低温、胶体状态炼钢，不像洋法转炉炼钢那样一定要用高温铁水炼钢。因此不死板要求生铁中的含矽成分，也不需要外加铁合金去助燃，既能适应成分不一的各种土铁废铁，又摆脱了所谓低矽铁（白口铁）不能炼钢的教条束缚。
    因为这个炼钢方法的特点是靠火焰间接加热，而不是燃料与钢直接接触，所以它能广泛使用各种燃料如烟煤、无烟煤、煤块、煤球……，因此，在缺少木材木炭的地方，都可以采用。唯一的要求是煤中硫份尽可能低些，以免钢的质量受到不良的影响（热锻时发脆）。这个炉是用机械鼓风的。如果改用风箱，估计需用几个人拉的大风箱，则用人就要比较多一些。
    这个土法反射炉每炉每次装冷铁一百到一百八十斤，每炼一炉钢（不包括锤打成块的时间）约九十分钟或更短一些，每炉每天能产钢一吨左右，炼出的钢质量还好。据分析，用含矽低（0.27％）、硫磷均高（硫0.67％、磷0.63％）的废铁、废锅炼出的钢，成分却不差：炭0.096％、矽0.1％、磷0.07％、硫0.089％。
    建设这种炼钢炉所需的材料、设备是很少的。每个炉子除马达、鼓风机等外，只需三、四十块耐火砖、九根生铁条。其余是青砖、砖坯和黄泥。
    采用这个方法，钢与煤的比例是一比一，较好的二比一或三比一，这将大大减少煤的耗量，也可以设法用热装。如果在有小土高炉的地方，都能用热铁水直接在土法反射炉里炼钢，估计更会大大降低煤耗。
    土法反射炉的部分内腔是用耐火材料做衬里。烧煤炉膛内壁上，另加一层厚二公分的耐火泥（占四分之一）、焦炭粉（占四分之三）的混料，这样既耐高温，又不粘煤渣。
    火道、烧煤炉膛上部（约三十公分）和喷嘴周围，温度最高，需用合适的耐火材料。其他部分可以用土坯、青砖或红砖，用泥砌。炉身外面都用黄土加草筋涂满，以防漏气。
    鼓风机：二到三马力，风压三百到四百公厘水柱，风量每分钟八到十立方公尺。
    土法反射炉炼钢的炉料，他们曾经用过下面三种配料方法。一种是全部生铁（白口铁、灰口铁都可以），尽可能用硫、磷较低的铁。一种是生铁82％，铁矿石12％，石灰石6％（炼的钢作化学分析）。另一种，生铁93％，铁矿石，3％，石灰石4％。各地原料不同，不能硬套。配料中加铁矿石是作氧化剂，石灰石是熔剂。铁矿石和石灰石不能加得太多。
    操作步骤：1、点火：烧煤炉膛内用木柴点着后加一小部分煤，燃起后把全部煤放进去（一般加煤一百斤左右），然后加盖、封口、鼓风。冶炼过程中如觉温度不够，可以中途加煤，但要动作快一些。2、装料：时间早晚一点皆可，按附图炉型，一次加入全部铁料一百到一百二十斤（最高曾加过一百八十八斤）。铁块不宜太大；薄片五到六公分，块子三到四公分。石灰石和铁块都在一公分左右。3、加热：在加热初期，炉口用铁板挡住，不必多动原料，等它发红发白时，把周围边上温度较低的铁块拨到中间去。4、搅炼：铁料碎散或成厚糊状时，颜色先红后白。这时要多搅翻，把下层的黑料翻起来，翻得彻底。尤其要注意熔池后部不让有铁粘底，让原料均匀地受到火焰吹炼。经过多次搅动，铁粒变白、炉渣开始流动。继续搅动，搅的次数，根据具体情况，一般二到五分钟搅翻一次。如见很多白色火花外溅，应减少风量。如见熔池内沸腾很厉害，发白，也要减少风量。原料成粘糊状后，再搅动两次，然后把钢料集中到熔池，不再翻搅。但须使钢料抛松些，促进通气。这样隔三分钟左右，等到钢粒互粘，就可以准备出钢。5、出钢：把钢团捣成一块块重五到十五斤左右的块子，钢团的大小可以根据需要来规定。钢团出炉后，快用木锤在木砧上打（也可以用铁锤在铁砧上打）。要打得快，否则毛胚易裂。6、钢出完后，必须把渣扒清楚，备下一炉用。烧煤炉膛的炉篦上、壁上的煤渣也要清除。（附图片）
