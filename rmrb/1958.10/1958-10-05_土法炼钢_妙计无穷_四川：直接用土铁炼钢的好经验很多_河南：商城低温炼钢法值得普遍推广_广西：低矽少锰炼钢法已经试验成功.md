This newspaper Chongqing, October 4th dispatch: In Sichuan, various places in the mass indigenous steelmaking movement have created many good experiences in directly refining local iron into steel.

    Currently, towns, institutions, schools, and street residents in Sichuan Province are widely using crucible furnaces for steelmaking, generally using scrap steel or adding a small amount of pig iron as raw materials. To solve the problem of limited scrap steel and its inability to be supplied for the long term, the faculty and students of the Department of Metallurgy at Chongqing University recently conducted steelmaking experiments in crucible furnaces using pig iron with more impurities produced by indigenous blast furnaces. As a result, they produced a batch of medium carbon steel. They used local iron as raw material, and hematite ore and iron oxide scale as oxidizing agents to remove the impurities contained in the local iron, and then used lime and fluorite as slagging agents. The quality of the refined steel was proven to be good after chemical testing. Many units in Chongqing are now promoting this experience.

    The Suining Special District is prevalent in a kind of local iron cementation steelmaking method. This method does not require ferrosilicon or scrap steel, but directly uses a wrought iron furnace to stir local iron into wrought iron, then puts it into a blacksmith's furnace for heating, and cements a certain amount of carbon into it, making it into carbon steel with a carbon content of less than 1.7%, and then draws it into strips, and quenching turns it into steel. This method has simple equipment, as long as a carbon fire reverberatory furnace is built with sand, stone, and clay, equipped with bellows or a blower, plus tools such as large hammers and fire tongs, steel can be made, and it is most suitable for promotion in villages, communes, and units with few people.

    Many counties in northern Sichuan use an indigenous converter to directly refine local iron into steel. This indigenous converter is made by cutting gasoline drums in half. A small half is used as a furnace cover, and quartz stone is crushed into fine powder and mixed with yellow mud to paste inside the other half of the barrel to make the furnace body, and a five-horsepower blower is installed to make an indigenous converter. This method is generally suitable for steelmaking in special and county agricultural implement factories, with each loading about two hundred catties of material and a steel output rate of 75%.

    The experience of various places in Sichuan proves that indigenous steelmaking can completely turn local iron directly into steel without using scrap steel or only mixing a small amount of scrap steel. Blacksmith furnaces in many towns turn local iron into wrought iron, heat it red, and repeatedly hammer and forge it to refine low-carbon steel.

    According to Henan Daily, Xinyang County and Shangcheng County in Henan Province produced 1,167.33 tons and 1,083.75 tons of steel respectively on September 30th. The Shangcheng County's homegrown low-temperature steelmaking method is worth popularizing.

    These two counties rely on the "small, indigenous, mass" method of steelmaking, and steel production has soared. After three days of preparation, Xinyang County increased its daily steel production from 2 tons on September 27th to more than 1,100 tons on the 30th, more than doubling the total steel production from January 1st to September 28th this year. Six hundred and twenty-one steelmaking furnaces in Shangcheng County are producing day and night, and the cumulative steel production in nine months has reached more than 2,560 tons.

    The steelmaking method homegrown in Shangcheng County is simple and easy to learn, and raw materials can be obtained locally. It can be promoted wherever there is iron, and it fully conforms to the "small, indigenous, mass" principle. The characteristics of Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking method are:
    
    (1) Obtain materials locally and use them locally. White pig iron smelted by indigenous blast furnaces can be directly refined into low-carbon steel, and waste pots and scrap iron can also be used as steelmaking raw materials. Both cold iron and hot molten iron can be used for steelmaking. The fuel used is firewood and charcoal. The quality of the steel is not much different from the low-carbon round, square, and flat steel materials refined by foreign methods, and it can be used to manufacture various agricultural tools, implements, tools, etc.

    (2) The equipment is simple, the furnace is built quickly, it costs less money, but the output is not small. The indigenous steelmaking furnace itself is lined with yellow soil and sand, and only three small iron plates and six iron nails are used. The steelmaking tools are a bellows, four iron bars, five iron hammers, and two anvils. A pair of steelmaking furnaces can be built in twelve hours of work. It only costs about 300 yuan to build a pair of furnaces (build furnaces in pairs, using one in rotation). A shift can refine 1,500 jin of steel.

    (3) There are not many people used, the organization is flexible, and the technology is easy to learn. Each steelmaking furnace has eight people per shift: one steelmaker, two tongsmen (tongs steel blocks during forging), four hammerers (hammer steel blocks), and one bellows puller. Steelmaking technology can be learned in ten and a half months.

    (4) Steelmaking saves pig iron, and not much fuel is used. Each ton of steel uses 1.15 tons of cold pig iron. If hot molten iron is used, it only needs about 1.1 tons. Each ton of steel uses about 120 kilograms of firewood and charcoal. If hot molten iron is used for steelmaking, it only needs about 50 kilograms of firewood and charcoal.

    The principle of Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking is basically the same as that of foreign converter steelmaking: that is, using air blowing to oxidize the impurities (carbon, silicon, etc.) in the iron. However, its advantage is that it refines steel in a low-temperature, colloidal state. Unlike converter steelmaking, it must use high-temperature molten iron for steelmaking, so it does not require high or low silicon content in the pig iron raw materials, nor does it need to add ferroalloys to aid combustion. Therefore, it can adapt to the situation where the composition of pig iron from indigenous iron smelting furnaces is uncertain, and it also gets rid of the dogmatic束缚 of adding ferrosilicon when using low-silicon iron for steelmaking. This low-temperature steelmaking method can be on an equal footing with other steelmaking methods; in the current situation where indigenous iron is produced in large quantities, converter steelmaking cannot keep up, and raw materials such as ferroalloys are lacking, it is worth popularizing.

    This newspaper Nanning, October 4th dispatch: Reporter Gong Chenghua reported: A low-silicon and low-manganese steelmaking method that can save a large amount of important raw materials for steelmaking—ferrosilicon and ferromanganese—has been successfully tested at the Liuzhou Manufacturing Plant in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and is currently being widely promoted. This is an important method to alleviate the current tension in the supply of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese in the nationwide steelmaking campaign.

    Low-silicon and low-manganese steelmaking is to use the original silicon content of pig iron itself for blowing during the melting of molten iron in a cupola furnace and in converter steelmaking, and only add a small amount of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese as deoxidizers in the molten steel ladle. The chemical composition and physical properties of the steel made by this method, after testing and microscopic examination with a metallographic microscope, fully meet the national standards for No. 6 medium carbon steel. According to this method, the Liuzhou Manufacturing Plant reduced the proportion of ferrosilicon from 2.2% to 0.5% and ferromanganese from 3% to 0.8% for every ton of steel refined. Due to the reduction of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese, the combustion time was shortened, and the time for the Liuzhou Manufacturing Plant to blow a furnace of steel with the same 200 kg Bessemer converter was reduced from 18 to 22 minutes in the past to 11 to 12 minutes. Recently, the experience of the Liuzhou Manufacturing Plant has been promoted in some steelmaking units in Nanning and Guilin. Guilin Agricultural Machinery Factory also achieved success in using waste scrap iron and white pig iron without adding ferrosilicon for steelmaking. (Attached picture)

  本报重庆4日电　四川各地在群众性土法炼钢运动中，创造了许多直接把土铁炼成钢的好经验。
    目前四川省各城镇、机关、学校和街道居民，广泛用坩锅炉炼钢，普遍以废钢铁或加少量生铁作原料。为了解决废钢铁有限、不能长期供应的难题，重庆大学冶金系师生最近全部用土高炉生产的含杂质较多的生铁在坩锅炉内进行炼钢试验，结果，炼出了一批中炭钢。他们用土铁作原料，用赤铁矿石和氧化铁皮作氧化剂，去掉了土铁中所含的杂质，再用石灰和萤石作造渣剂。炼出的钢经化验证明质量良好。现在重庆许多单位都在推广这项经验。
    遂宁专区盛行一种土铁渗钢法。这种方法不需要用矽铁、废钢铁，而直接用炒钢炉把土铁炒制成毛铁，然后放入打铁炉加热，渗进一定数量的炭素，使它变成含炭1.7％以内的炭素钢，再抽打成条，淬火就变成钢。这种办法，设备简单，只要用沙石、粘土筑一个炭火反射炉，装上风箱或鼓风机，加上大锤、火钳等工具就能炼钢，乡、社和人少的单位最适宜于推广。
    四川北部不少县采用一种土转炉直接把土铁炼成钢。这种土转炉是把汽油桶截成两半做成的。其中一小半做炉盖，再用石英石碎成细粉，和黄泥糊在另一半节桶内做炉身，装一个五马力的鼓风机，就成了土转炉。这种办法一般适合于专、县农具厂炼钢，每次装料二百斤左右，出钢率达到75％。
    四川各地的经验证明，土法炼钢可以不用废钢铁或只要掺和少量的废钢铁，就能完全把土铁直接变成钢。许多城镇的铁匠炉把土铁变成毛铁后，烧红，反复锤、锻，就炼出低炭钢来。
    据河南日报消息　河南省信阳县和商城县在9月30日一天中，分别产钢一千一百六十七点三三吨和一千零八十三点七五吨。商城县土生土长的低温炼钢法值得普遍推广。
    这两个县依靠“小、土、群”的办法炼钢，钢产量激增。信阳县经过三天的准备，使钢的日产量由9月27日的日产两吨跃进到30日的一千一百多吨，超过了今年1月1日到9月28日产钢总数的一倍还多。商城县六百二十一座炼钢炉日夜进行生产，九个月产钢累计已达二千五百六十多吨。
    商城县土生土长的炼钢法简单易学，原料可就地取材，凡有铁的地方都可推行，完全符合“小、土、群”的方针。商城土法炼钢的特点是：
      （1）就地取材，就地使用。能用土高炉炼的白口生铁直接炼成低炭钢，也能用废锅废铁作炼钢原料。既能用冷铁炼钢，也能用热铁水炼钢。用的燃料是劈柴、木炭。钢的质量与洋法炼的低炭圆、方、扁钢料不差上下，可以制造各种农具、器具、工具等。
    （2）设备简单，建炉快，花钱少，产量却不少。土法炼钢炉本身用黄土加砂搪成，只用三个小铁板，六个铁钉。炼钢工具是风箱一只，铁杠四根，铁锤五个，铁砧两个。一班工作十二小时就可以建起一对炼钢炉。建一对炉子（成对建炉，轮流使用一个）只要花三百元左右。一班能炼钢一千五百斤。
    （3）用人不多，组织灵活，技术容易学会。每个炼钢炉上，每班八人：一人炼钢，两人掌钳（锻钢时钳钢块），四人打锤（打钢块），一个拉风箱。炼钢技术十天半月就能学会。
    （4）炼钢节约生铁，用燃料也不多。每吨钢用冷生铁一点一五吨，如用热铁水只要一点一吨左右。每吨钢用劈柴、木炭共约一百二十公斤，如用热铁水炼钢，只要劈柴、木炭五十公斤左右。
    商城土法炼钢与洋法转炉炼钢的道理，基本上是一致的：即用空气吹炼，氧化掉铁中的杂质（碳、矽等）。但它的优点是：在低温、胶体状态炼钢，不像转炉炼钢那样一定要用高温铁水炼钢，所以不要求生铁原料中含矽高低，也不需要外加铁合金去助燃。因此，既能适应土炼铁炉生铁成分不定的情况，又摆脱了用低矽铁炼钢需加矽铁的教条束缚。这种低温炼钢法，可与其他炼钢方法平起平坐；在当前土铁大量生产，转炉炼钢跟不上去、铁合金等原料缺乏的情况下，值得普遍推广。
    本报南宁4日电　记者龚成华报道：一种能够大量节约炼钢重要原料——矽铁、锰铁的低矽少锰炼钢法，在广西僮族自治区柳州制造厂试验成功，目前正在普遍推广。这是缓和当前全民炼钢运动中矽铁、锰铁供应紧张的一个重要方法。
    低矽少锰炼钢就是在冲天炉里熔化铁水和在转炉炼钢时，利用生铁本身原有的含矽量来吹炼，只在钢水包中加入少量的矽铁和锰铁作脱氧剂。用这种方法炼出的钢化学成分和物理性能，经过化验和用金相显微镜检查，都完全符合国家规定的六号中炭钢的标准。根据这个方法，柳州制造厂由过去每炼一吨钢的矽铁比例由2.2％降低到0.5％，锰铁由3％降低到0.8％。由于矽铁、锰铁减少，燃烧时间缩短，柳州制造厂用同样一个二百公斤的贝氏转炉吹炼一炉钢的时间，由过去的十八到二十二分钟降低到十一至十二分钟。最近，柳州制造厂经验已经在南宁、桂林的一些炼钢单位中推广。桂林农械厂用废杂铁、白口铁，不加矽铁炼钢也获得成功。（附图片）
