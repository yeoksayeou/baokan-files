    Training with Warriors, Living with Soldiers:
    PLA Officers Go Down to Companies to Serve as Soldiers

Xinhua News Agency, 7th – Recently, a large number of officers from all branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been enthusiastically discussing the benefits of cadres serving as soldiers, eagerly signing up to go down to the companies. The first group of officers who went down to the companies are living a happy life as soldiers, eating, living, working, operating, and entertaining with the soldiers.

Since the issuance of the decision by the CCP Central Committee and the State Council regarding cadres participating in physical labor, and the General Political Department's regulation that cadres at all levels should spend one month each year serving as soldiers in companies, "Go to the company to be a soldier!" has become a fervent demand of cadres at all levels. At the Party Representative Conference held in the Guangzhou area, General Huang Yongsheng and more than 570 other officers signed up in the first batch. Among the officers in the Nanjing area who were approved by the Party committee to go down to the companies after individual applications, there were 30 generals including General Xu Shifa. In the Shenyang area, General Deng Hua, Lieutenant General Du Ping, and 218 other officers all arrived at the companies on the 5th. Lieutenant General Qin Jiwei in the Kunming area also led more than 120 officers from the leading organs to the companies to serve as soldiers on the same day. The officers in the Chengdu area, led by Lieutenant General Huang Xinting and Lieutenant General Wei Jie, unanimously expressed their determination to be "five-good" soldiers to offer as a gift to the Party.

The vast majority of the first group of officers who went down to the companies were veteran soldiers who had fought in numerous battles. Today, they are all wearing ordinary soldiers' uniforms again, carrying soldiers' luggage and equipment, and living with young soldiers. After General Yang Dezhi, Major General Li Yaowen, and Major General Chen Meizao of the Jinan area carried their backpacks to the company, they were immediately assigned to squads. Under the command of the squad leader, they "touched, crawled, rolled, and fought" with the soldiers in training, and eagerly swept the floor, tidied up their personal belongings, and served meals. After Qi Zhicheng, the artillery commander of a certain unit, arrived at the company, he immediately learned how to operate artillery with the soldiers, and during breaks, he scrambled to fetch hot water and wipe weapons. As soon as Zhao Zhenxing, the deputy head of a certain regiment, arrived at the breeding squad, he was assigned to do public service. Without even tidying up his backpack, he went to hoe weeds and lead the horses. Ten cadres from a certain unit who were assigned to the artillery squad learned the movements of all the artillerymen in three days. After learning the basic movements of the artilleryman, the chief of staff of a certain regiment said that serving as a soldier in the company can make oneself a true artillery expert with theory and practice. Many leading cadres also realized the significant role of going deep into reality and getting close to the masses in improving their leadership style.

These decentralized cadres have generally been welcomed by the soldiers in the companies. Some soldiers said: The leading comrades are so old, living, crawling, and studying hard with us. How can we not study hard! Some said that it is a rare and unprecedented event for a sergeant squad leader to lead a general, and the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, and sharing weal and woe in the People's Army is truly touching. In these companies, the relationship between officers and soldiers is closer than before, the unity is more consolidated, and all tasks are advancing by leaps and bounds, presenting a brand new situation of leaping forward again.

    和战士同操练　与士兵共生活
    解放军军官下连队当兵
    新华社7日讯　中国人民解放军各兵种部队的广大军官，最近几天大谈干部当兵的好处，争相报名下连当兵。第一批下连的军官，都和战士同吃、同住、同劳动、同操作、同娱乐，过着愉快的士兵生活。
    从中共中央、国务院关于干部参加体力劳动的决定和总政治部关于各级干部每年下连当兵一个月的规定发出以后，“到连队当兵去！”成了各级干部的热烈要求。广州地区部队举行的党代表大会上，黄永胜上将等五百七十多位军官第一批报了名。南京地区部队经过个人申请，党委批准下连当兵的军官当中，有许世发上将等将军三十名。沈阳地区部队邓华上将、杜平中将等二百十八名军官，5日全部到了连队。昆明地区部队秦基伟中将也在这天带领一百二十多名军官离开领导机关前往连队当兵。成都地区部队以黄新廷中将、韦杰中将为首的下连当兵的军官，一致表示当“五好”战士，向党献礼。
    第一批下连的军官绝大多数是身经百战的老战士，他们今天都重新穿上普通士兵的服装、携带着士兵的行李和装备，和年青的士兵一起生活。济南地区部队杨得志上将、李耀文少将、陈美藻少将等背着背包到连队以后，立即被分配到班里，在班长指挥下和士兵一起“摸、爬、滚、打”地进行操练，并抢着扫地、整理内务、打饭打菜。某部炮兵司令员齐志诚到连队以后，立即跟士兵学习操炮，休息时间争着打开水、擦拭武器。某团副团长赵振兴刚到饲养班，就遇到派公差，他连背包没有整就去锄草、蹓马。某部十个到炮班当兵的干部，三天学会了各个炮手的动作。某团参谋长在学习了炮手基本动作以后说，下连当兵可以使自己成为一个有理论、有实际的真正的炮兵内行。许多领导干部也体会到深入实际，接近群众，对改进领导作风的重大作用。
    这些下放干部在连队里，普遍受到了士兵的欢迎，有的士兵说：领导同志这样大年纪，和我们一起生活，一起滚爬，苦学苦练，我们不好好学习还行吗！有的说，一个中士班长领导一个上将，真是亘古未有的奇事，人民军队的官兵一致、上下一致、同甘苦共患难的光荣传统，真是叫人感动。在这些连队里，官兵关系比以前更加密切了，团结更加巩固了，各项工作都在突飞猛进，出现了跃进再跃进的崭新局面。
