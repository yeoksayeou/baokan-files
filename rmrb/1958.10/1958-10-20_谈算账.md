In our work, to understand the relevant aspects of a situation, and to explore the basis and methods for completing tasks, we often need to calculate accounts. "If you don't adjust the lamp, it won't be bright; if you don't calculate the accounts, things won't be clear." After calculating the accounts, we have a clear picture in mind, and the work is easier to arrange and carry out. When planning a task, we often calculate more than one account, but many. For example, we calculate the manpower account, the material resources account, the time account, and also the account of the interrelationships between various tasks. Among these, the most important is, of course, the manpower account. There are different ways to calculate the manpower account. Some people simply count the number of people, while others not only count the number of people but also include the most valuable things about people – their thoughts, wisdom, and experience.

At present, the rural work tasks are very heavy. Steelmaking and ironmaking need people, autumn harvesting and planting need people, and other work also needs people. Labor is temporarily tight. Therefore, everyone has been calculating the manpower account recently, seeking effective ways to overcome this difficulty. However, because the calculation methods are different, the results are very different.

After the nationwide rectification campaign and socialist education, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production, people's communist consciousness has greatly improved. They work without regard to compensation, day and night, and try every means to do a good job. One such person can be worth two, five, ten… Mobilizing such people can overcome any difficulty, no matter how great. As long as the manpower account is calculated in this way, both leaders and the masses will feel happy and have high confidence. In these places, a lively situation of simultaneous steel production and autumn harvesting and planting has already emerged. This is one situation.

But there is another situation where people simply count the number of people – how many people there were in the past, how many people there are now… As a result, the labor force becomes more and more strained, the difficulties become more and more numerous, and they are full of worries and concerns. They say, "The strong laborers have all been transferred to the steel front, and there is no way to complete the agricultural production tasks." Due to the influence of this kind of thinking, the work tends to grasp one aspect and lose the other, and there is even a danger of grasping nothing and achieving nothing.

Why do some people calculate the manpower account in one way, and others in another way? There is only one reason: have they really seen the people? The sign of really seeing the people does not lie in seeing the shape of the people, nor merely in seeing the number of the people, but in seeing the people's thoughts, wisdom, experience, and the power of organization. If you have not seen these, you cannot be said to have truly seen the people. Isn't the fact very obvious? The farmers of New China are different from the farmers of Old China, the farmers who have liberated their minds are different from the farmers who have not liberated their minds, today's farmers are different from yesterday's farmers, and tomorrow's farmers will be different from today's farmers. Only by seeing these differences, only by seeing the changes in the farmers' thinking, the development in wisdom and experience, can we make a correct estimate of the strength of today's farmers, and can we closely rely on the farmers in rural work, and work with the farmers to find ways to solve various problems. Not long ago, Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province extracted 50,000 laborers for steel production, and some people shouted that the labor force was tight. The Chang'an County Party Committee decided to launch a major debate on the issue of "labor shortage" among cadres and the masses throughout the county. Once the debate started, solutions were found. They mobilized all women who were not participating in production, teenagers over the age of ten and elderly people around the age of sixty, students, office cadres, urban residents, and local troops, adding approximately 70,000 male and female laborers. The people's communes also freed up more than 7,000 laborers from sewing departments, canteens, and barbershops to invest in autumn harvesting and planting. Field labor was militarized to improve labor utilization and labor efficiency. In addition, the masses also proposed methods such as not letting vehicles return empty and not letting people return empty-handed, bringing manure to the fields and carrying crops home on the way back. After adopting these measures, people no longer shouted "labor shortage," and the county was able to shorten the completion of autumn harvest and sowing from the originally planned thirty-five days to twenty-five days.

To calculate such accounts, we cannot only rely on a few people sitting in a room to calculate, but we must mobilize the peasant masses to calculate. Experience has proven that when major difficulties occur in work, if only a few cadres calculate accounts behind closed doors, they may not be able to figure out a solution even after eight days and eight nights, because the vision, hearing, and thoughts of a few cadres are, after all, limited, and some people are not very likely to accurately see the thoughts, wisdom, and experience of the peasant masses. But once the peasant masses are mobilized to speak out freely and engage in major debates, the difficulties that previously worried a few cadres become the focus of attention of the broad masses, and the methods to overcome the difficulties that the cadres had not previously thought of are constantly being generated. In this way, the more the accounts are calculated, the more hopeful they become, and the more joyful they become, and the cadres and the masses all have a strong confidence in overcoming difficulties and completing tasks. A township Party secretary in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, said a profound thing: "Now, the rural labor account cannot be calculated while sitting in a room, or your head will spin; but as long as you talk to the masses and present the task, the masses' soaring enthusiasm will make your heart clear, solutions will be found, and problems will be solved." This is truly based on experience.

    谈算账
    程浦
    在工作当中，为了弄清有关各方面的情况，探求完成任务的依据和方法，常常要算账。“灯不拨不明，账不算不清。”经过算账，心中有数了，工作也就便于安排和展开了。筹划一件工作，往往不止算一笔账，而是要算好多笔账，比如算人力的账，算物力的账，算时间的账，还要算各种工作相互关系的账。其中最重要的当然是人力的账。对于人力账，有不同的算法，有人只简单算人数，有人不光算人数还把人的最可贵的东西——思想、智慧、经验都算在里边。
    当前农村工作任务十分繁重，炼钢炼铁要人，秋收秋种要人，其他工作也要人，劳动力一时紧张起来。因此，近来大家都在算人力账，寻求克服这个困难的有效办法。但因算法不同，结果也就大不相同。
    经过全民整风和社会主义教育，特别是农业生产的大跃进，人们的共产主义觉悟大大提高，劳动不计报酬，白天干，黑夜干，而且千方百计地要干好。这样的人一个可以顶二个、五个、十个……。把这样的人调动起来，天大的困难都能克服。只要是这样来算人力账的，领导者和群众都心情舒畅，信心很高。在这些地方也已经出现了钢铁生产和秋收秋种并驾齐驱的生动局面。这是一种情况。
    但也有另一种情况，因为只是简单算人数，过去有多少人，现在有多少人，……结果，劳力越算越紧张，困难越算越多，忧心忡忡，顾虑重重。他们说：“强劳力都调到钢铁前线上去了，农业生产任务没办法完成。”由于这种思想的影响，工作有抓住一面，丢掉另一面的趋势，甚至更有什么也抓不住，什么也搞不好的危险。
    同是算人力账，为什么有的人是这样算，有的人是那样算？原因只有一个：真正见到了人没有？真正见到了人的标志不在于见到人的形状，也不仅仅在于见到人的数量，而在于见到了人的思想、智慧、经验和组织起来的威力。没有见到这些，就不能算真正见到了人。事实不是很明显吗？新中国的农民就不同于旧中国的农民，解放了思想的农民就不同于没有解放思想的农民，今天的农民就不同于昨天的农民，明天的农民又会不同于今天的农民。只有看到这些不同，只有看到农民的思想方面的变化，智慧、经验方面的发展，才会使我们对今天的农民的力量作出正确的估计，才会使我们在农村工作中紧紧地去依靠农民群众，同农民群众一起来想办法，解决各种各样的问题。陕西省长安县不久以前抽出五万劳动力搞钢铁生产，有些人大叫劳力紧张。长安县委就决定在全县干部和群众中就“劳力紧张”问题展开大辩论。一辩论就有了办法。把全县没有参加生产的妇女，十岁以上的少年和六十岁左右的老人，学生、机关干部、城镇居民、当地驻军动员起来，大约增加了七万个男女劳动力。各个人民公社又从缝纫部、食堂、理发室腾出七千多个劳动力投入秋收秋种。田间劳动实现军事化，提高劳动利用率和劳动效率。另外群众还提出了出车不空放、人不空手回的办法，下地带送粪，回家捎庄稼。采取这些措施以后，人们再不喊“劳力紧张”了，全县完成秋收秋播可由原计划的三十五天缩短到二十五天。
    要算这样的账，不能只靠少数人坐在房子里算，必须发动农民群众来算。经验证明，当工作发生重大困难的时候，如果只是少数几个干部关着门算账，即使算它八天八宿也不一定能算出个眉目来，因为少数干部的所见、所闻、所想，毕竟是有限的，有些人也不大容易准确地看得见农民群众的思想、智慧和经验。而一当发动农民群众起来大鸣大放大辩论，原先使少数干部发愁的困难就变成广大群众注意的焦点，原先干部没曾想到的克服困难的办法也源源不断地被想出来了。这样，账越算越有希望，越叫人欢喜，干部和群众都有了战胜困难、完成任务的坚强信心。湖南省宜章县一个乡党委书记说过这样一段意味深长的话：“如今农村劳力账坐在房子里算不得，一算脑壳就发昏；可是只要你和群众一谈，把任务一摆，群众的冲天干劲就会教你心里亮堂，办法也有了，问题也就解决了。”这真是经验之谈。
