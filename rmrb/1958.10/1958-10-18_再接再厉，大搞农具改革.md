　　On October 16th, this newspaper reported on page three that Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, had popularized more than 2,000 rope-traction machines, completing the autumn sowing task eight days ahead of schedule, and the deep plowing was all over one foot deep. Qingyang People's Commune in Jiangyin County made very slow progress in autumn sowing because it did not use all the rope-traction machines in the commune. These two examples well illustrate that reforming agricultural tools is one of the important ways to solve the shortage of labor. In fact, the experience of the past year has long proven this point. In the large-scale farmland water conservancy basic construction last winter and this spring, and in the subsequent spring plowing and summer hoeing campaigns, there was also a phenomenon of labor shortage. The solution, in addition to strengthening specific leadership, making comprehensive arrangements for labor, and mobilizing the broad masses of farmers to exert their efforts, was to reform agricultural tools. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, farmers across the country have reformed nearly 300 million pieces of agricultural tools, saving a total of 60 billion workdays. Many places have come to the conclusion that agricultural tool reform is one of the seven major measures (water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, elimination of pests, and tool reform) for striving for high yields.
　　Recently, due to the further implementation of the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, grasping industry with the right hand and agriculture with the left, the rural labor force has appeared tight. The labor shortage is a great thing, which not only illustrates the rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural construction, but also forces us to carry out technological revolution and vigorously promote agricultural tool reform. At present, many places are further mobilizing the masses to vigorously promote agricultural tool reform to solve the problem of labor shortage. However, this work, especially the promotion of new agricultural tools, has been very slow in a few places. There are many reasons for this phenomenon.
　　Some people think that production is too busy and tense now, and there is no time for tool reform. Being busy is a fact, and being tense is also a fact. But reforming tools is precisely to solve the problem of being busy and the problem of being tense. To put the tool reform work in opposition to the busy and tense production is to look at the problem superficially: production is already very busy, and adding a tool reform work is really adding more work to the busy and more tension to the tense. In fact, reforming tools is to solve the problem of being busy and tense. Why are we busy? Why are we tense? Isn't it because of the labor shortage? Reforming tools is to add labor from another aspect. Reforming and popularizing a new tool can increase labor efficiency by multiples or tens of times, which is equivalent to increasing the labor force by multiples or tens of times. Doesn't this solve the problem of being busy and tense? When Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, promoted rope-traction machines, it spent a lot of effort in rushing to make rope-traction machines, holding on-site meetings, organizing everyone to debate, and so on. But after the promotion, not only did they no longer feel the labor shortage, but they also completed the autumn sowing task ahead of schedule. Can this be said to be adding more work to the busy and more tension to the tense? Only those who dare not and are unwilling to carry out tool reform are becoming more and more busy and more and more tense. Isn't this the case with Qingyang People's Commune in Jiangyin County?
　　Some people think that mobilizing the masses to reform old agricultural tools one by one has a small effect and is slow, so it is better to achieve mechanization all at once. Of course, it is good to implement mechanization all at once. But it is not possible now. Because to implement mechanization, we must first develop the iron and steel and machinery industries. Now the people of the whole country are fighting for the development of the iron and steel and machinery industries. According to China's experience, the road and steps to implement mechanization should be to first reform the existing agricultural tools to achieve semi-mechanization; and then, on the basis of this semi-mechanization, implement complete mechanization. This is a way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. In the past year, nearly 300 million pieces of agricultural tools have been reformed across the country, and they are all made locally. Among the agricultural tools created and invented by the masses, a few have been improved and upgraded to become advanced agricultural tools. For example, the already existing electric rope-traction machine (electric plow) is no less efficient than a tractor, and it has advantages that a tractor does not have. Chinese farmers have thousands of years of practical experience in agricultural tools, passed down from generation to generation, and it has always been an untapped treasure, long buried. After liberation, especially after the whole-people rectification and the great leap forward in agricultural production, the broad masses of farmers have established a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and have begun to develop and improve the accumulated experience. Therefore, we should attach great importance to this creation of the broad masses of farmers, and we must not give it any slight regard.
　　Some people think that reforming agricultural tools is easy to say but difficult to do. Sometimes there is no technology, sometimes there is no material; sometimes although there is technology and material, they cannot be manufactured for a while, and even if they are manufactured, they are not perfect; sometimes even if they are made well, the farmers are not used to using them... In short, there are too many difficulties, too many difficulties, and the agricultural tool reform work cannot be carried out. There are difficulties, even great ones, but they are not insurmountable. When any new thing appears, it will encounter some difficulties, and only after overcoming these difficulties can the new thing develop. The same is true of agricultural tool reform. "Reform" is to revolutionize the old, not only the "life" of the old agricultural tools, but also the "life" of the thinking of people who are accustomed to using the old agricultural tools. The experience of agricultural tool reform in the past year has proved that in this work, there should be such a revolutionary spirit: if there are no tools, reform them ourselves; if there are no materials, put them together ourselves; if there is no technology, study it ourselves.
　　It must also be explained that our advocacy of mobilizing the masses to solve problems with "native" methods does not mean that we do not want "foreign" methods. The "foreign" methods that others have used effectively and scientifically are also indispensable. Therefore, in addition to universally mobilizing the masses to reform tools, each county can also have some specialists who use "foreign" methods to improve and upgrade the "native" tools with universal significance into "foreign" tools. This is "foreign" out of "native." The electric rope-traction machine was produced on the basis of mass creation. But at present, "native" should be the main focus.
　　The mass viewpoint of some leaders who are in charge of agricultural tool reform is very weak. They do not believe in the masses, and they do not rely on the masses. They do not consult with the masses to solve problems. They look down on the inventions and creations of the masses, thinking that they cannot solve major problems. However, the agricultural tool reform movement is precisely a mass creative movement. Therefore, to do a good job in agricultural tool reform, we must first solve the mass viewpoint problem of these people, that is, strengthen their mass viewpoint, ask them to follow the mass line, and discuss and carry out agricultural tool reform work together with the masses. Otherwise, it will not be done well. The fact is also proving this: if the masses are deeply mobilized, the agricultural tool reform work can be transformed into a vigorous mass movement, and great achievements can be obtained. On the contrary, it will be scattered, deserted, and nothing can be done well.
　　In order to solve the problem of labor shortage brought about by the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture, and also to prepare for a greater leap forward in production next year, all localities should continue their efforts and do a good job in agricultural tool reform.

### 再接再厉，大搞农具改革

    再接再厉，大搞农具改革
    10月16日本报三版报道江苏江都县小纪人民公社推广了二千多部绳索牵引机，提前八天完成了秋播任务，而且深耕都在一尺以上。江阴县青暘人民公社因为没有把全社的绳索牵引机使用起来，秋播工作进展得十分迟缓。这两个例子很好地说明了改革农具是解决劳动力不足的重要办法之一。其实，一年来的经验，早就证明了这一点。去冬今春进行大规模农田水利基本建设和以后的春耕、夏锄运动中，也曾有过劳动力不足的现象，解决的方法，除了加强具体领导，对劳动力进行全面安排，发动广大农民鼓足干劲之外，就是改革农具。据不完全统计，一年来，全国农民改革农具近三亿件，节省出来的劳动日共有六百亿个。不少地方得出这样的经验，农具改革是争取丰产的七大措施（水、肥、土、种、密和消灭虫害、改革工具）之一。
    最近，由于进一步贯彻执行工农业并举的方针，右手抓工业，左手抓农业，农村劳动力就显得紧张。劳力紧张是一件大好事，它既说明了我国工农业建设的飞跃发展，又逼着我们去进行技术革命，大搞农具改革。目前已经有许多地方正在进一步发动群众大搞农具改革，解决劳力不足的问题。但是这个工作特别是对新农具的推广，在少数地方进展得很迟缓。所以发生这种现象，原因很多。
    有人认为现在生产太忙太紧张，没有时间进行工具改革。忙是事实，紧张也是事实。但是改革工具正是为了解决忙的问题、紧张的问题。把改革工具工作同生产忙、紧张对立起来，这是从表面上看问题：生产已经很忙，再加上一项工具改革工作，真是忙上加忙，紧张上加紧张。实际上呢，改革工具，就是为了解决忙和紧张的问题。为什么忙呢？为什么紧张呢？还不是因为劳动力不足？改革工具就是从另一个方面去增添劳动力。改革和推广了一种新工具，可以成倍、成十倍地提高劳动效率，这也就等于成倍成十倍地增加了劳动力。这样不是解决了忙和紧张的问题了吗？江苏江都小纪人民公社在推广绳索牵引机的时候，是花了不少力量，赶制绳索牵引机，召开现场会议，组织大家辩论，等等。但是推广以后，不但不再觉得劳动力紧张，而且提前完成了秋播任务。这能说忙上加忙吗？紧张上加紧张吗？只有那种不敢和不愿进行工具改革的人，才是越来越忙，越来越紧张。江阴青暘人民公社不就是这样吗？
    有人认为发动群众一件一件地改革旧农具，效果小，来得慢，不如一下实现机械化好。能一下实行机械化当然好。但是现在还办不到。因为要实行机械化，就得首先发展钢铁和机械工业。现在全国人民正在为钢铁、机械工业的发展而斗争。按照中国的经验，实行机械化的道路和步骤应当是首先对已有的农具进行改革，达到半机械化；然后在这半机械化的基础上，再实行完全的机械化。这是一种多快好省的办法。一年来，全国就改革了近三亿件农具，而且都是就地取材，就地制造。在群众所创造发明的农具中，又有少数经过改进提高之后，成为先进的农具。像已经出现的电力绳索牵引机（电犁），效率就不低于拖拉机，而且具有拖拉机所没有的优点。中国农民在农具上面有几千年的实践经验，一代传一代，一直是一个未开发的宝藏，长期被埋没着。解放以后，特别是经过全民整风和农业生产大跃进，广大农民树立起了敢想敢说敢作的共产主义风格，开始把积累下来的经验，加以发挥，加以提高。因此，我们应当十分重视广大农民的这种创造，绝不能予以半点轻视。
    有人认为改革农具说起来容易做起来很难，有时没有技术，有时没有材料；有时技术、材料虽然都有了，但是一时制造不出来，即使制造出来了，又不十全十美；有时即使作得还不错，但农民不习惯使用……，总之，困难太多了，困难太多了，农具改革工作无法进行。困难是有的，甚至很大，但不是不能克服。任何新事物出现时，都会遇到一些困难，只有战胜这些困难之后，新事物才能发展起来。农具改革也是如此。“改革”就是革旧的命，不仅革旧农具的“命”，而且要革习惯使用旧农具的人的思想的“命”。一年来农具改革的经验证明，在这一工作上，应当有这样的革命精神：没有工具自己改，没有材料自己凑，没有技术自己钻。
    也必须说明，我们提倡发动群众，用“土”办法解决问题，并不等于不要“洋”办法。别人已经用之有效的、合乎科学的“洋”办法，同样是不可缺少的。因此，每个县除了普遍发动群众改革工具以外，还可以有些专人采用“洋”办法，把带有普遍意义的“土”工具加以改进提高，成为“洋”工具。这是“土”中出“洋”。电力绳索牵引机是在群众创造的基础上产生的。但是目前应当以“土”为主。
    有些领导农具改革工作的干部的群众观点非常薄弱，不相信群众，不依靠群众，他们有困难不同群众商量解决；他们对群众的发明创造看不起，认为解决不了大问题。可是农具改革运动恰恰是个群众性的创造运动。因此要搞好农具改革工作，就得首先解决这些人的群众观点问题，即加强他们的群众观点，要他们走群众路线，同群众一起来讨论和进行农具改革工作。否则，是搞不好的。事实也是这样证明的，深入发动了群众，就可以把农具改革工作变成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动，就可以获得巨大的成就。反之，就零零落落，冷冷清清，搞什么东西也不成，搞什么东西也不好。
    为了解决工农业共同跃进所带来的劳力不足问题，同时也为了给明年更大的生产跃进作准备，各地都应该再接再厉，把农具改革工作做好。
