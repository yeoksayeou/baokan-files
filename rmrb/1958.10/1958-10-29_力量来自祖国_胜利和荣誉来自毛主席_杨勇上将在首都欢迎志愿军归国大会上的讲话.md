Dear Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and Central Leaders, fellow elders, brothers, and sisters of the capital:

Your children, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who have been away from you for a long time, have now returned to the embrace of the motherland and to the side of their loved ones. We have come to the capital with the wish of all officers and soldiers of the army, "To see Chairman Mao in Beijing after achieving victory," to meet with the Central Committee comrades. Entrusted by all officers and soldiers, we are here to report on the Volunteer Army's eight years of work in resisting America and aiding Korea to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the China Peace Committee, who led us to achieve the great victory in the struggle against America and aiding Korea. Please allow me, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, to extend our greetings to the beloved people of the capital! Greetings to Chairman Mao! Greetings to the leaders of the Party Central Committee!

Our Victory is Due to the Correct Leadership of the Party and the Support of the People of the Motherland

From the first day of our return to the country, we have been warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland. After arriving in Beijing, we have received a grand welcome and warm reception from the Central Committee, various agencies, organizations, and the people of the capital. This has made us deeply realize once again the boundless love of our great motherland for her children. This is the greatest honor bestowed upon us by the people of the motherland, and it is also a great encouragement and impetus to us. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the people of the capital and to the people of the whole country! We clearly know that any achievement made by the Volunteer Army in the past eight years is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and the full support of the people of the whole country. The Volunteer Army has only done its share of the work. The decisive factors in the great struggle against America and aiding Korea were the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to resist America and aid Korea, the great movement against America and aiding Korea launched by the people of the whole country, and the support of the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world. Those who should enjoy the honor of victory are first and foremost our beloved Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, the great people of the motherland, as well as the people of the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world.

Comrades: In the struggle against America and aiding Korea, the reason why the Volunteer Army was able to defeat the most powerful American army in imperialism with inferior equipment, expose the true face of this outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger to the world, and achieve great victory, lies in the fact that the Volunteer Army implemented the correct political and military lines of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in the full support of the motherland for us. When we lacked weapons and equipment, the motherland donated and transported large quantities of aircraft, artillery, and tanks to us. When we were in the most difficult living conditions, the motherland made and transported winter clothing, summer clothing, and other supplies that were better year by year. The motherland selected the most outstanding children and sent them to the front lines in Korea to ensure the replenishment of our new recruits, so that hundreds and thousands of new soldier heroes emerged in the Battle of Shangganling and the counterattack on the Jin City front. The successive comfort delegations and cultural troupes sent by the motherland brought us unlimited spiritual encouragement. It was Chairman Mao's instruction that the United States is a paper tiger, that we should despise the enemy strategically and take the enemy seriously tactically, that gave us the direction and confidence to defeat the American aggressors. It was Chairman Mao's instruction to learn warfare through warfare that enabled us to break the superstition of modern warfare, and thus, according to the characteristics of the Korean War, create tunnel warfare, small-unit activities, sniper and artillery attacks, mass infantry firepower against air strikes, iron transportation lines, and other effective combat methods rarely seen in ancient and modern war history, achieving "fight one battle, take one step forward," becoming stronger and stronger as we fought, and achieving victory. It was Chairman Mao's instruction to cherish every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea that made us understand how to specifically apply and develop the fine traditions of our people's army in military-government relations and military-civilian relations while fighting alongside the armies and people of brotherly countries abroad, thus greatly consolidating and developing the friendship between China and Korea over these eight years. Therefore, when the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army talk about the achievements of resisting America and aiding Korea, they always say: "Strength comes from the motherland, victory and honor come from Chairman Mao." This is absolutely correct. It is precisely because of this that in the eight years that the Volunteer Army was in Korea, whether in the difficult years of war or in the days of defending peace after the war, we were always thinking of the motherland, thinking of Chairman Mao, and naturally thinking of Beijing. In the past eight years, although we were far away from the motherland, Beijing was very close to us. Whether in the tunnels, on the sentry posts and patrol lines along the 38th parallel, or on construction sites working together with the Korean people, we heard the voice of Beijing on the radio and passed on and discussed everything we heard from the motherland. Thus, we intimately felt the warmth given to us by the motherly care of the people of the motherland, the confidence and strength given to us by Chairman Mao's kind teachings, and the encouragement given to us by the rapid progress of the motherland's construction under the leadership of the Party. We often felt that Beijing was not thousands of miles away, but close to us. In the Battle of Shangganling, the phrase "Behind Wusheng Mountain is Beijing" became the greatest source of encouragement for defending every tunnel and every trench. When we personally built the underground Great Wall spanning the 38th parallel, the soldiers affectionately called some of the larger tunnels, which could garrison troops in wartime and hold meetings in peacetime, our Beijing Hotel, and the passages connecting the tunnels our East and West Chang'an Avenue. This was not a casual name, but an expression of the hearts of our soldiers. They regarded Beijing as the heart of the motherland, as a symbol of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Indeed, for eight years, Beijing gave us light and warmth. The five-star red flag that was first raised in Tiananmen Square nine years ago has been flying in the hearts of each of us. Every year on May 1st and October 1st, Chairman Mao's warm greetings to the marching crowds on the Tiananmen Gate Tower echoed in the minds of each of us, encouraging us to do everything the motherland needs us to do for the motherland! Whenever we thought of the motherland, we first thought of Beijing, of our beloved Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao who lived in Beijing. In this way, we felt warm in the severe cold of forty degrees below zero; in the fierce battle of gunfire, we were even more courageous; and when working with the Korean people, we were full of energy. Whenever we encountered serious difficulties, the officers and soldiers would be greatly encouraged and all difficulties would be easily solved when they thought of the motherland and Chairman Mao; whenever we encountered unimaginable hardships, the officers and soldiers would be full of hope and confidence when they thought of the motherland and Chairman Mao, and laughter of revolutionary optimism would be everywhere, even if they did not eat for several days and did not sleep for several nights, they would still win the battle; whenever they encountered danger, the officers and soldiers would be full of energy when they thought of the motherland and Chairman Mao, and no danger would be a problem, even if they had to go through fire and water and dedicate their precious lives, they would not hesitate. Huang Jiguang, upon hearing that the motherland's comfort delegation to Korea had arrived at the Shangganling front, said, "Let the people of the motherland, let the representatives sent by Chairman Mao hear our good news!" After such a heroic oath, he threw himself on the enemy's gun muzzle and used his own blood and chest to block the enemy's machine gun that was firing frantically, opening the road to victory for his comrades. The martyr Zhang Jianhua wrote in his diary before his sacrifice: "Even if we shed some blood today, it can make our motherland strong and firm, unafraid of bombs, unafraid of burning flames, our parents will always laugh." He embraced such a wish and shed his last drop of blood in Korea. The wish of Huang Jiguang and Zhang Jianhua is the common wish of thousands of officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army. It is this wish that encouraged them to do one heroic deed after another. Some sacrificed themselves generously on the heroic Korean land, and some insisted on the struggle against America and aiding Korea for eight years. Although they were far away from their hometowns for a long time, they wholeheartedly regarded the safety of the motherland and the happiness of thousands of compatriots as their greatest pleasure. The reason why the motherland can produce such a great power for the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army is not because of anything else, but because our motherland is liberated, a motherland where the working people are the masters of their own affairs, a motherland that is advancing towards an infinitely beautiful socialist and communist society under the leadership of the great Communist Party and the great people's leader Chairman Mao. In order to defend such a lovable motherland, how could every officer and soldier of our Volunteer Army not fight and work selflessly?

Comrades, since we crossed the triumphal arch on the Yalu River Bridge and returned to the embrace of the motherland three days ago, one new atmosphere and new things after another have unfolded before our eyes along the thousand-mile journey from Andong to Beijing. We have deeply felt that our understanding of the great appearance of the motherland's Great Leap Forward is still too little. Not to mention comrades who have not returned to the motherland for a long time, even comrades who returned to the motherland a few months ago to participate in the "May Day" celebration all felt that the motherland had undergone tremendous changes in these short few months. Faced with these changes, we could not restrain our excited feelings. Along the way, we heard the songs of the Great Leap Forward, saw the scenes of the Great Leap Forward, and felt the increasingly rising communist spirit. In these few days, we only walked a corner of our great motherland, but the great spirit of the people of the motherland rushing forward like ten thousand horses to wage war on the earth and attack nature deeply attracted the children who had been away from the motherland for a long time, making the soldiers who had just returned from the 38th parallel in Korea couldn't help but eagerly try and long to join the labor upsurge of building the motherland.

Brought the Deep Affection of the Korean People, Brought the Good News of the Korean People's Whipping Forward

Comrades, we have just returned from heroic Korea. We have brought to the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao the deep affection of the Korean people for the Chinese people. At the same time, we have also brought the good news of the Korean people galloping forward on the Chollima towards socialism. After the Korean people frugally, worked hard, and overfulfilled and completed the post-war three-year plan for the reconstruction and construction of the national economy ahead of schedule, they started the first five-year plan for socialist construction last year, deciding to develop agriculture and light industry at the same time under the premise of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. The Korean people carried out arduous struggles to realize the plan indicators ahead of schedule. In 1957, both industrial and agricultural production greatly overfulfilled the tasks. The total industrial output value was originally planned to increase by 22% compared with 1956, but actually reached 44%. Agriculture was originally planned to increase grain production to 2.85 million tons, but although it suffered a particularly severe drought, the output still increased to 3.2 million tons, reaching the highest record in Korean history. By August of this year, the total number of farmers joining cooperatives had reached 98.6%. This year, almost at the same time as the people of our country launched the Great Leap Forward, Premier Kim Il-sung proposed to the Korean people to gallop forward on the Chollima on the socialist road. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Workers' Party, based on the proposal of Premier Kim Il-sung, vigorously mobilized the masses to run local industries on a large scale. In less than three months, with no national investment at all, relying on the masses to create and use waste materials, more than 400 factories were set up by the end of August, and the output value jumped several times. Now, the slogan "Galloping on the Chollima" is a household name in Korea, everyone is full of energy, and miracles are appearing one after another. For example, the 75-mile wide-gauge railway in Hizhou's Xiashanggian, according to the speed of laying during the Japanese rule, would have taken three to four years, but the youth commando team completed it in only 75 days. In order to meet the rapidly growing housing needs, construction workers in Pyongyang have exhausted all kinds of methods and are building 20,000 houses with the labor and materials originally planned to build 7,000 houses. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards, the northern democratic base of Korea has been unprecedentedly consolidated, and the people are full of confidence and optimism about the future. Premier Kim Il-sung recently told us that Korea's first five-year plan will likely be completed in the first three years; and in a few years, Korea will reach an annual output of 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, 25 million tons of coal, 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and grain production will increase to 7 million tons. This thriving development scene of the northern democratic base of Korea is in sharp contrast with the dark and miserable scene in southern Korea under the rule of Syngman Rhee. There, large areas of land are barren, and grain production is reduced by 40% compared to the past. Factories are closing down one after another, and the output value is less than half of that during the Japanese rule. The number of unemployed people is more than 4 million, and there are 500,000 homeless orphans. The two are a clear contrast of two worlds. The Syngman Rhee clique relies on American aid and squeezes the blood and sweat of the people, desperately expanding its own army and armed forces, and is willing to be a tool and sacrifice for American imperialism to create tension. The Syngman Rhee clique has long lost its prestige, and it is difficult to maintain its puppet rule without relying on the bayonets of American soldiers; but the more it pleases the Americans, the more it will anger the patriotic Korean people, and it will eventually be unable to escape the fate of destruction. The Korean people are continuing to devote themselves to the peaceful reunification of the motherland with unparalleled firm confidence. We believe that the Korean people, who have shown unparalleled heroism and tenacity in the war against American aggression and unparalleled diligence and hard work in reconstruction, will surely achieve the expected victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, realize their own wishes, and no one can stop the reunion of the 30 million compatriots in the north and south of Korea and the peaceful reunification of the 3,000-mile rivers and mountains.

During our troop withdrawal this time, we deeply experienced the unparalleled deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people. On our way from the garrison, through Pyongyang to Sinuiju, we were warmly greeted everywhere by the Korean people, who supported the old and the young and sang and danced. Many old Korean grandpas and grandmas, the treasures passed down from their ancestors for generations, and the beloved items that were rescued from the flames of war in every possible way and have been cherished all the time, like many old grandpas giving the enemy-killing steel knives used by their ancestors in the Renyin Patriotic War, like the mother of Korean People's Democratic Republic hero Li Shoufu giving her most precious souvenirs, Li Shoufu's ring left when he sacrificed, were all warmly given to our officers and soldiers when bidding farewell to the Volunteer Army, asking us to bring the Korean old people's heart to Chinese fathers and mothers. Workers sent their own machine models and ore specimens to let us show them to the Chinese workers' brothers. Farmers sent carefully selected famous Korean rice varieties and the "Rose of Sharon," which symbolizes that the flower of friendship will never fade, and asked us to bring them back to sow on the land of China and bear more grain and flowers of friendship. Women solemnly presented us with banners embroidered by thousands of people collectively, with poems praising the friendship between China and Korea, and even the girls' most precious hair, as well as the homework books and drawing books of young students. Along the way, even children as young as three or five years old waved their small hands to us, and the kind of moving friendship was very touching. The heroic Korean people never shed a tear under the atrocities and cruel bombing of the US military. In front of the enemy, they swallowed their tears into their stomachs and turned them into a fire of hatred, and carried out the most heroic and tenacious desperate struggle against the invaders. However, when bidding farewell to the Volunteer Army, they couldn't help but shed tears of farewell.

Proletarian Internationalist Solidarity is the Most Reliable Source of Strength for us to Defeat Imperialism

The Korean people's such flesh-and-blood friendship towards our army and the people of our country has an extremely deep foundation and a long history. The Korean people have cultivated extremely deep internationalist ideas in their long struggle. Therefore, the Korean people have shown the greatest comradeship and comrades-in-arms feelings in the world to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who resisted the American aggressors with them. In the early days of the war, the great Korean mother An Yuji sacrificed herself to save a Volunteer Army scout who fell into the hands of the enemy; in the middle of the war, in the Battle of Shangganling, there appeared the famous internationalist fighter Park Jae-geun; in the counterattack on the Jin City front in 1953, when the Volunteer Army wounded being carried by the Korean stretcher team was bombed by enemy planes, there were father and son heroes Fang Xingfu and Fang Yuangen who sacrificed their son to cover the wounded, and the father left his injured son to rescue the Volunteer Army wounded first; in the post-war period, in order to help our army build barracks, Zheng Shangji, a worker and party member of Pyongyang City, dedicated his precious life to labor. All of this is certainly not accidental. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, the heroic Korean people have truly achieved the close integration of patriotism and internationalism, and have developed a noble style of unparalleled hatred for the enemy, unyielding loyalty, and unparalleled love and selflessness for friends. The Volunteer Army in Korea for eight years can be said to have attended a full eight years of internationalist university, and the education received was extremely profound. In practice, we have deeply realized that proletarian internationalist solidarity is the most reliable source of strength for us to defeat imperialism. A Chinese People's Volunteer Army can be far away from the motherland and hometown and unhesitatingly dedicate his life to the cause of independence and freedom of another country and nation; similarly, an ordinary Korean people can unsparingly shed his own blood for a warrior who is not related to him, does not speak his language, and comes from another country. This is simply incomprehensible in the eyes of gentlemen in capitalist countries. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is unbreakable. Because the formation of this friendship is not only due to the coincidence of interests between the two peoples in the face of enemy aggression, but more importantly, because we are both socialist countries, both under the leadership of the Communist Party, and have the same great goal of fighting for communism. Only when the great Marxism is grasped by the liberated working people, and when patriotism and internationalism are completely integrated for the sake of common beliefs and common interests, is it possible to raise the relationship between one country and nation and another country and nation to the same high level as the friendship between China and Korea. This is the specific manifestation of the communist thought of "One for all, all for one" in international relations. We relied on this solidarity to achieve past victories, and we will continue to rely on this solidarity in the future to win greater victories in the struggle for lasting world peace and the construction of socialism.

Going Abroad to Participate in the War for Peace, Returning to the Motherland for Peace, We are Still Ready at All Times for the Motherland's Call

Comrades, when the last batch of Volunteer Army troops began to withdraw from Korea, the army of US imperialism not only continued to be entrenched in South Korea, but also frantically interfered in our country's internal affairs in the Taiwan Strait area, creating new threats of war. By the time the Volunteer Army had completely withdrawn from Korea, this military provocation was still going on. In the face of such facts, who wants peace and who wants war; who is aggression and who is justice; who is sending troops across the ocean to other countries to expand colonial rule, and who is truly and consistently striving to let the people of all countries solve their own problems, is really the clearest. What else does the US aggressor have to say? The rulers of the United States must know that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army still withdrew from Korea in its entirety according to the original plan while you were intensifying the tension in the Far East. This not only shows the sincerity of the Chinese people in striving for peace, but also shows that we have great power and firm confidence in maintaining the peace we have won, crushing any aggression, realizing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and realizing the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu in our country. This action itself is a great contempt for the war threats of US imperialism. The US imperialists in the Korean War have long been thoroughly exposed by the Chinese and Korean people as a paper tiger that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, no matter how it bares its fangs and claws, it can no longer scare anyone. At present, whether it is the overall world situation, the Asian situation, or the situation in the Korean and Chinese Taiwan Strait regions, the East wind prevails over the West wind. The US imperialists, who persist in the war policy, have fallen into a state of siege in the Arab region, the Taiwan Strait region, or the Korean issue, and are everywhere in the position of the accused, and everywhere have put the noose around their own necks. If it does not repent and confess its crimes, and does not withdraw its aggressive troops from the Taiwan Strait region, withdraw from southern Korea, and withdraw from all other military bases on foreign territory as soon as possible, then this public enemy of mankind, who has done all kinds of bad things in the world, will eventually suffer the consequences of its own actions and eventually be destroyed by the noose it has put around its own neck. The Chinese people are willing to have peace, and the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea is the most powerful proof. But striving for peace does not mean fearing war. Eight years ago, we also repeatedly warned the American aggressors who were frantically attacking Korea at that time, and repeatedly put forward the proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. We had endured again and again, waited again and again, but when all of this was ineffective, when the American aggressor army even marched in force to the Yalu River and fired bombs and shells on our northeastern territory, the Chinese people, who could no longer endure, resolutely sent their own Volunteer Army to Korea to fight alongside the heroic Korean People's Army and drive them back to the 38th parallel where they originally launched the war. After our army entered Korea to participate in the war, we still consistently devoted ourselves to striving for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. Since the Korean armistice negotiations began in July 1951, we have repeatedly made great efforts to achieve a ceasefire. However, when the American aggressors mistakenly regarded our peace efforts as a sign of weakness and instead repeatedly made unreasonable demands, we had no choice but to use force to teach a lesson to such an aggressor who was obsessed with force and lost his mind. In the summer of 1953, we launched a counterattack on the Jin City front, breaking through the enemy's solid defense line overnight, and shifting the front line southward on a large scale within a few days, annihilating more than 120,000 enemies one after another. The American aggressors, who originally wanted to unreasonably occupy 1,200 square kilometers north of the defense line between us and North Korea, were then forced to quickly sign the armistice, thereby ending the shameful war launched by the American aggressors in Korea. From the entry of the Volunteer Army into Korea eight years ago until our army's complete withdrawal from Korea today, historical facts have proved to the world: We went abroad to participate in the war for peace, and returned to the motherland for peace, but our love for peace and our striving for peace do not mean begging for peace from the aggressors. Our endurance for peace is limited. We have a firm determination and enough strength to teach a lesson to the fire players of war when necessary. The American aggressors should not forget: when you launched the Korean War, the economic strength and national defense strength of the Chinese and Korean people were still relatively weak. At that time, we mainly relied on light weapons, and later we only had a small number of aircraft and artillery to fight. The US military had the advantage of the sea and air force, which played a major role in the terrain of the Korean Peninsula, and used all the latest weapons in large quantities except for atomic bombs. But after three years of fighting, the American aggressors paid a huge price of 390,000 American casualties and consumed 20 billion US dollars in war expenses, but they got nothing, and were finally driven back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel and forced to cease fire. So, today, when the strength of the Chinese and Korean people is ten times or dozens of times greater than it was a few years ago, when the desire of all the Korean people for the US military to get out of the southern half and for the peaceful reunification of the motherland is unprecedentedly strong, when our motherland can overproduce 10.7 million tons of steel this year and reach 1,000 kilograms of grain per person, has its own nuclear energy industry, and has implemented the people's commune of all people being soldiers, when the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is united as never before, and the Soviet Union has mastered the advantage of intercontinental missiles, if US imperialism is unwilling to give up aggression and wants to risk fighting us again, then it will not only be a loss of troops and generals. At that time, along with the failure of its aggression, it will be the complete destruction of the entire US imperialism. The Volunteer Army soldiers said it well: "US imperialism, US imperialism, don't be picky, bombs will blow up your big belly; the noose has been put around your neck, if you move around, you will surely go west!" The Volunteer Army soldiers who personally punctured the US paper tiger have no doubt about this. At the same time, the entire withdrawal of the Volunteer Army from Korea, this action to strive for peace, does not mean that the Chinese people have abandoned the internationalist obligation to jointly defend against aggression with the Korean people. After the Volunteer Army returns to China, the Volunteer Army representatives in the Korean Military Armistice Commission will still remain there and work together with the Korean People's Army representatives to continue to strive to supervise the implementation of the Korean armistice. Comrades: Now US imperialism is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and American warships and planes are constantly intruding into our country's territorial waters and airspace, carrying out military provocations, interfering in China's internal affairs, and creating a conspiracy of two Chinas. On the way home, the officers and soldiers wrote down their vows in a gun poem. This poem is like this: "Gun is polished, knife is unsheathed, anger is burning in the chest; Motherland, I swear to you, the order will be given immediately." This poem fully represents the firm will of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and no Americans are allowed to interfere. The American robbers should get out of Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Mazu, and complete the great cause of the motherland's reunification. Dear ones, we are ready at all times to listen to your call. As long as the motherland needs, we will not hesitate to contribute everything we have to our beloved motherland!

Long live our great motherland!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    同志们：在抗美援朝斗争中，志愿军所以能够以劣势装备战胜了帝国主义中最强大的美国军队，向全世界戳穿了这只外强中干的纸老虎的真像，取得了巨大的胜利，原因就在于志愿军执行了党中央和毛主席的正确的政治路线和军事路线，在于祖国对我们的全力支援。祖国，在我们缺乏武器装备的时候，给我们捐献和运来了大批飞机、大炮和坦克，祖国，在我们生活最艰苦的时候，给我们制作和运来了一年更比一年好的冬装、夏服以及其他各种物资。祖国，把最优秀的子弟选送到朝鲜前线保证了我们新兵的补充，使上甘岭战斗和金城前线反击战中，涌现出成百成千的新战士英雄。祖国，一次一次派来的慰问团、文工团给我们带来了无限的精神鼓舞。是毛主席关于美国是一只纸老虎，战略上要藐视敌人，战术上要重视敌人的指示，给了我们以打败美国侵略军的方针与信心。是毛主席关于在战争中学习战争的指示，使我们打破了对现代化战争的迷信，从而根据朝鲜战争的特点，创造出坑道战，小部队活动、冷枪冷炮杀敌，群众性步兵火器对空射击、钢铁运输线等等成效卓著的、古今中外战史上所少有的战法，做到了“打一仗，进一步”，愈战愈强，而获得胜利。是毛主席关于爱护朝鲜一山一水，一草一木的指示，使我们懂得了在国外同兄弟国家的军队和人民并肩奋斗中，如何具体运用我国人民军队在军政关系、军民关系上的优良传统并加以发扬，从而在这八年中，大大巩固与发展了中朝友谊关系。所以，志愿军的指战员在谈到抗美援朝的成绩时，总是说：“力量来自祖国，胜利和荣誉来自毛主席”，这是一点也不错的。也正是因为这样，志愿军在朝鲜的八年间，无论是在艰苦的战争岁月里，或是在战后捍卫和平的日子里，都无时无刻不想念着祖国，想念着毛主席，同时也就自然的想念着北京。在过去的八年当中，我们虽然远离祖国，但北京对我们却是非常亲切的。无论在坑道里，在三八线的哨位和巡逻线上，或者在同朝鲜人民共同劳动的工地上，我们都从广播里听到北京的声音，并且互相传告和讨论着听到祖国的一切。从而亲切地感受到了祖国人民对我们慈母般的关怀所给予我们的温暖，感受到毛主席对我们亲切的教导所给予我们的信心与力量，以及在党的领导下祖国建设一日千里的进展所给予我们的鼓舞。我们经常觉得北京不是远在千里之外，而是近在我们身边。在上甘岭战斗里，“五圣山后通北京”这一句话，成为坚守每一条坑道、每一条战壕的最大鼓舞力量。当我们亲手建筑起横贯三八线的地下长城的时候，战士们把一些比较宽敞的，战时可以屯兵，平时能够开会的大坑道，亲切地叫做我们的北京饭店，把一些连接坑道的通道，亲切地称呼为我们的东西长安街。这不是随便的称呼，而是表达了我们战士的心，他们把北京看做祖国的心脏，看做是党中央和毛主席领袖的象征。的确是这样，八年来，北京给了我们光和热，九年前在天安门前第一次升起的五星红旗，一直飘扬在我们每个人的心间，每年“五·一”、“十·一”毛主席在天安门城楼上向游行队伍亲切的问好声，时刻回响在我们每个人的脑际，鼓舞着我们去为祖国做祖国需要我们做的一切！每当我们想起祖国的时候，首先我们就想起北京，想起住在北京的我们亲爱的党中央和毛主席，这样，在零下四十度的严寒里，我们感到了温暖；在枪林弹雨的激烈战斗里，我们更加勇气百倍，在和朝鲜人民一起劳动的时候，我们干劲十足。每当遇到严重的困难时，一想到祖国和毛主席，指战员们就勇气倍增，一切困难就迎刃而解；每当我们遇到难以想像的艰苦时，一想到祖国和毛主席，指战员们就充满着希望和信心，到处洋溢着革命乐观主义的欢笑，即使几天不吃东西，几夜不睡觉，也照样打胜仗；每当遇到危险时，只要一想到祖国和毛主席，指战员们便浑身是劲，什么样的危险都一概不在话下，即使赴汤蹈火，献出自己宝贵的生命，也在所不惜。黄继光就是在听到祖国赴朝慰问团到了上甘岭前线时，说了“让祖国人民，让毛主席派来的代表听我们的好消息吧！”这样的壮烈誓言之后，奋身扑到敌人的枪眼上，用自己的热血和胸膛，堵住了敌人正在疯狂扫射的机枪，为战友打开了胜利的道路。烈士张建华在牺牲前的日记里边这样写道：“就是我们今天流点血，能使我们祖国牢又牢，不怕炸弹炸，不怕烈火烧，我们的父母常欢笑”，而他也就抱着这样的愿望，把自己的最后一滴血流在了朝鲜。黄继光、张建华的这种愿望，也就是志愿军千千万万指战员的共同愿望，就是这种愿望，鼓舞了他们做出一个又一个的英雄事迹，有的慷慨牺牲于英雄的朝鲜国土之上，有的八年如一日地坚持了抗美援朝斗争，虽然长期远离家乡，却一心把祖国能得到安全，千千万万同胞能得到幸福视为自己最大的愉快。祖国，对志愿军指战员所以能产生这样巨大的力量，不是因为别的，而是因为我们的祖国是解放了的，由劳动人民当家做主的祖国，是在伟大的共产党和伟大的人民领袖毛主席的领导下，向着无限美好的社会主义、共产主义社会迈进的祖国。为了保卫这样一个可爱的祖国，我们志愿军每一个指战员，怎么能不忘我地去战斗和工作呢？
    同志们，从我们跨过鸭绿江桥上的凯旋门，回到祖国怀抱的三天以来，从安东到北京的千里旅途中，一个接一个的新气象，新事物展现在我们眼前，我们更深深感到，我们对祖国大跃进的伟大面貌的了解还是太少了；不必说长期没有回过祖国的同志，就连几个月以前曾回过祖国参加“五一”观礼的同志，也无不感到祖国在这短短的几个月内又已发生了巨大变化。面对着这些变化我们实在抑制不住激动的心情。一路上我们听到的是跃进的歌声，看到的是跃进的景象，感到的是日益高涨的共产主义风气。我们在这几天里，只不过走了我们伟大祖国的一个角，但是祖国人民万马奔腾向地球开战、向大自然进攻的伟大气概，却深深吸引了久别祖国的儿女，使刚从朝鲜三八线那边归来的战士禁不住跃跃欲试，渴望投入建设祖国的劳动热潮中去了。
    带来了朝鲜人民的深情厚谊，带来了朝鲜人民加鞭前进的好消息
    同志们，我们刚刚从英雄的朝鲜回来，我们给祖国人民、给毛主席带来了朝鲜人民对中国人民的一片深情厚谊。同时，也带来了朝鲜人民跨上千里马向社会主义加鞭前进的好消息。朝鲜人民在节衣缩食、艰苦奋斗，超额和提前完成了战后三年人民经济恢复建设计划之后，从去年就开始了第一个社会主义建设的五年计划，决定在优先发展重工业的条件下，同时发展农业和轻工业。朝鲜人民为提前实现计划指标进行了艰巨奋斗，1957年工农业生产都大大超额完成任务，工业总产值原计划比1956年增长22％，实际达到44％，农业原计划谷物增产到二百八十五万吨，虽然遭到了特别严重的干旱，但产量仍然提高到三百二十万吨，达到了朝鲜历史上的最高纪录。合作化运动到今年8月，加入合作社的农户总数已达到98.6％。今年，差不多在和我国人民展开大跃进的同时，金日成首相向朝鲜人民提出了在社会主义大道上跨上千里马加鞭前进的号召。劳动党的六月全会，又根据金日成首相的建议，大力发动群众，大办地方工业，不到三个月时间，在完全没有国家投资的情况下，依靠群众创造和利用废旧物资，到8月底就已经办起了四百多个工厂，产值一下跃进了几倍。现在，“跨上千里马”的口号，在朝鲜已是家喻户晓，人人都是干劲冲天，奇迹一个接一个出现。例如，海州下圣间七十五里的宽轨铁道，按日本统治时期铺设速度，需要花三年到四年时间，但青年突击队只用了七十五天就完成了。平壤市建筑工人为了满足飞速增长的住宅需要，就想尽各种办法，正在用原计划建筑七千户住宅的劳力、资材，建筑两万户住宅。随着工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善，朝鲜北部民主基地已空前巩固，人民充满对前途的信心和乐观。金日成首相最近告诉我们说，朝鲜的第一个五年计划，将有可能在头三年内完成；而再过几年，朝鲜就将达到年产钢三百万到三百五十万吨，煤炭二千五百万吨，电力二百亿度，粮食产量将增长到七百万吨。朝鲜北半部民主基地这种欣欣向荣的发展景象，同朝鲜南部在李承晚统治下一片黑暗凄惨景象恰成鲜明对照。在那里，田地大片荒芜，粮食产量比过去减少40％。工厂纷纷倒闭，产值不到日本统治时期的二分之一，失业人数达四百余万，流离失所的孤儿达五十万。两相对比，真是两个世界。李承晚集团依靠美援，并榨干了人民血汗，拼命扩大自己的军队和武装，甘心作美帝国主义制造紧张局势的工具和牺牲品。李承晚集团早已威信扫地，不依靠美国兵的刺刀就很难维持其傀儡统治了；但它越是讨美国人的好，就越将激怒爱国的朝鲜人民，而最后将难逃灭亡的命运。朝鲜人民正以无比坚定的信心，继续致力于祖国的和平统一。我们相信，在抗美卫国战争中表现了无比英勇顽强、在恢复建设中表现了无比勤劳奋发的朝鲜人民，在争取祖国和平统一的斗争中，也一定会取得预期的胜利，实现他们自己的愿望，谁也阻挡不了朝鲜南北三千万同胞的骨肉团聚和三千里江山的和平统一。
    在我们这次撤军的过程中，我们深深体会到了朝鲜人民对中国人民的无比深厚的友谊。在我们从驻地出发，经过平壤直到新义州的路上，到处受到朝鲜人民扶老携幼、载歌载舞的热情欢送。许多朝鲜老大爷、老大娘把自己祖传几代的传家宝，和在战争烽火中千方百计抢救出来，一直珍藏身边的心爱物品，像好多位老大爷把自己祖先在壬辰卫国战争时用过的杀敌钢刀，像朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄李寿福的妈妈把自己最珍贵的纪念品、李寿福牺牲时留下的戒指都在送别志愿军时热情地赠给了我们的指战员，要我们把朝鲜老人的一片心意带给中国的父亲和母亲。工人送来了自己创制的机器模型和矿石标本，要我们带给中国的工人兄弟看一看。农民们送来了精心挑选的著名的朝鲜水稻良种和象征着友谊之花永开不败的
  “无穷花”，要我们带回来播种在中国的土地上，结出更多的友谊的粮食和鲜花。妇女们把由几千人集体绣成的、写着歌颂中朝友谊诗句的锦旗，甚至连同姑娘们最珍贵的头发，以及青年学生的作业本、习画册，都郑重的献给了我们。一路上，连三、五岁的孩子都无不伸着小手向我们挥手致意，那种种动人的友情真使人万分感动。英雄的朝鲜人民在美军的暴行和残酷轰炸下，从没有掉过一滴眼泪，他们在敌人面前把眼泪吞到肚里，变为仇恨的烈火，同侵略者进行了最英勇顽强的殊死斗争。但是，他们在送别志愿军时，却禁不住纷纷流下了惜别的热泪。
    无产阶级国际主义团结，是我们战胜帝国主义最可靠的力量源泉
    朝鲜人民对我军，对我国人民的这种亲如骨肉的友情，有着极其深厚的基础和长久的渊源。朝鲜人民在自己长期斗争的经历中，培植起了极其深厚的国际主义思想。因此，朝鲜人民对同他们一起反抗美国侵略者的中国人民志愿军，就表现了人世间最伟大的同志之爱和战友之情。还在战争初期，伟大的朝鲜母亲安玉姬，就为了援救一位陷入敌手的志愿军的侦察员而牺牲了自己；在战争中期的上甘岭战斗中，又出现了著名的国际主义战士朴在根；到1953年金城前线反击战中，在朝鲜担架队抬运的志愿军伤员遭受到敌机轰炸时，又有儿子舍身掩护伤员，父亲又舍下负伤的儿子，先把志愿军伤员抢救出来的父子英雄方兴福和方元根；到战后时期，为了帮助我军进行营房建设，平壤市工人、劳动党员郑山吉，又在劳动中献出了宝贵生命。这一切，当然不是偶然的。英雄的朝鲜人民在劳动党领导下，真正是做到了把爱国主义与国际主义紧紧融合在一起，养成了对敌人无比仇恨、坚贞不屈，而对朋友则无比热爱、舍己为人的高尚风格。志愿军在朝鲜的八年，可以说是上了整整八年国际主义的大学，所受的教育是极其深刻的。我们在实践中，深深体会到，无产阶级国际主义团结，是我们战胜帝国主义最可靠的力量源泉。一个中国人民志愿军，可以远离祖国和故乡，为了另一个国家和民族的独立自由事业，毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命；同样，一个朝鲜的普通人民，能够为着一个和自己非亲非故、语言不通、从另一个国家来的战士，毫不吝惜流尽自己的鲜血。这在资本主义国家的绅士们看来，是根本不可理解的，中朝人民之间这种友谊是牢不可破的。因为这种友谊的形成，并不仅仅是由于两国人民在敌人侵略面前的利害一致，更重要的，是由于我们都是社会主义国家，都是在共产主义政党领导下，有着为共产主义而奋斗的同一个伟大目标。只有当伟大的马克思主义为解放了的劳动人民所掌握的时候，为共同的信仰、共同的利益，把爱国主义和国际主义完全融合为一的时候，才有可能把一个国家和民族同另一个国家和民族的关系，提高到像中朝两国之间的友谊那样崇高的水平。这就是“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义思想在国际关系上的具体表现。我们依靠这个团结取得了过去的胜利，我们今后还要依靠这种团结，去赢得争取世界持久和平和建设社会主义的更大胜利。
    为和平出国参战，为和平返回祖国，我们仍时刻准备着祖国的召唤
    同志们，志愿军最后一批部队开始撤出朝鲜的时候，美帝国主义的军队不但继续盘踞在南朝鲜，而且又在我国台湾海峡地区疯狂干涉我国内政，制造新的战争威胁。到志愿军全部撤出朝鲜时，这种军事挑衅仍在进行。在这样的事实面前，究竟谁要和平，谁要战争；谁是侵略，谁是正义；谁为扩张殖民主义统治，而派兵远渡重洋到别的国家去，谁又是真正言行一致地努力让各国人民自己解决自己的问题，实在是最清楚不过了。美国侵略者现在还有什么话好说呢？美国的统治者必须知道，中国人民志愿军正在你们加剧远东紧张局势的时候，仍然按原计划全部撤出了朝鲜，这不仅表明了中国人民竭力谋求和平的诚意，而且还表明了：我们对于维护已得的和平，粉碎任何的侵略，对实现朝鲜问题的和平解决，实现我国台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖的解放，具有巨大的力量和坚强的信心。这个行动本身，就是对美帝国主义者战争威胁的一个极大的蔑视。美帝国主义者在朝鲜战争中，早已被中朝人民所彻底戳穿，是一只外强中干的纸老虎，不管它怎样张牙舞爪，再也吓不倒任何人了。目前，无论就整个世界局势，就亚洲局势，就朝鲜和中国台湾海峡地区的局势来说，都是东风压倒西风，坚持战争政策的美帝国主义者，无论是在阿拉伯地区的问题上，台湾海峡地区的问题上，或是朝鲜问题上，都已经陷入四面楚歌之中，并且处处居于被告的地位，处处把绞索套上了自己的脖子。它如果还不悔祸服罪，还不趁早把自己的侵略军队撤出台湾海峡地区，撤出朝鲜南部，撤出其它一切在外国领土上的军事基地，那么，这个在世界上做尽了坏事的人类公敌，终将自作自受，最后毁灭在它自己套在自己脖子上的绞索中。中国人民是愿意和平的，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，就是一个最有力的证明。但是努力谋求和平，却不等于害怕战争。八年前，我们对当时疯狂进攻朝鲜的美国侵略者，也曾一再发出警告，一再提出和平解决朝鲜问题的主张。我们曾忍耐再忍耐，等待再等待，但是当这一切都终归无效，当美国侵略军竟然大举向鸭绿江边进军，并把炸弹和炮弹打到我国东北领土上的时候，忍无可忍的中国人民就毅然派出了自己的志愿军入朝作战，同英雄的朝鲜人民军一道把它赶回到原来发动战争的三八线上。在我军入朝参战之后，仍然始终一贯地致力于争取朝鲜问题的和平解决。从1951年7月开始朝鲜停战谈判以后，我们曾一再为实现停战作过巨大的努力。但是，当美国侵略者错误地把我们的和平努力看作是示弱，反而一再提出无理要求，对这样迷信武力而丧失理智的侵略者，我们也只好用武力去教训它。1953年夏季，我们在金城前线举行反击，一夜之间突破敌坚固防线，几天之内使战线大片南移，先后歼敌十二万余人，原先要想无理侵占我朝中防线以北一千二百平方公里的美国侵略者，这时才被迫赶快签字停战，从而结束了美国侵略者在朝鲜发动的可耻战争。从八年前志愿军入朝参战直到今天我军全部撤出朝鲜，历史事实向全世界证明了：我们是为和平而出国参战，又为和平而返回祖国，但我们热爱和平，力争和平，决不是向侵略者乞求和平，我们为和平而忍耐是有限度的，我们有坚强的决心，也有足够的力量在必要时用来教训战争的玩火者。美国侵略者不应该忘记：在你们发动朝鲜战争的时候，中朝人民的经济力量与国防力量还是比较薄弱的，当时我们主要依靠轻武器，后来也只有少量的飞机大炮作战，而美军则拥有在朝鲜半岛地形上起重大作用的海空军优势，并且除了原子弹以外，大量使用了一切最新式的武器，但是打了三年的结果，美国侵略者以伤亡美军三十九万，消耗战费二百亿美元的巨大代价，却什么也没有得到，终于被赶回三八线附近，被迫停战。那么，当今天，中朝人民的力量已经十倍、几十倍于前几年的时候，当全朝鲜人民要求美军滚出南半部，要求祖国和平统一的愿望空前强烈的时候，当我们祖国今年就可超额生产一千零七十万吨钢达到每人千斤粮，有了自己的原子能工业，并且实行了全民皆兵的人民公社化的时候，当整个以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前团结一致，苏联已经掌握了洲际导弹优势的时候，美帝国主义如果不甘心于放弃侵略，而要冒险同我们再一次较量的话，那就将不仅仅是损兵折将而已，那时，连同他的侵略的失败一起到来的，将是整个美帝国主义的彻底毁灭。志愿军的战士说得好：“美帝美帝，不要挑皮，炸弹炸破你的大肚皮；绞索已套进你的脖子，你如乱动，管叫你一命归西！”亲手戳破了美国纸老虎的志愿军战士，对这一点确实是毫不怀疑的。同时，志愿军全部撤出朝鲜这一努力谋求和平的行动，并不意味着中国人民放弃了和朝鲜人民共同防御侵略的国际主义义务。志愿军回国之后，朝鲜军事停战委员会中的志愿军代表仍将留在那里，同朝鲜人民军代表一道，继续为监督朝鲜停战的实施而努力。同志们：现在美帝国主义仍霸占我国领土台湾，美国的军舰飞机不断的侵入我国领海领空，进行军事挑衅，干涉中国内政，制造两个中国的阴谋。归国途中指战员们曾在一首枪杆诗里写下了他们的誓言。这首诗是这样的：“枪擦亮，刀出鞘，胸中怒火在燃烧；祖国我向你宣誓，命令一下马上到。”这首诗完全代表了中国人民志愿军全体同志的坚定意志。解放台湾是中国的内政，决不允许美国人插手。美国强盗应当从台湾滚出去，我们一定要解放台、澎、金、马，完成祖国的伟大统一事业。亲人们，我们时刻准备着听从你们的召唤。只要祖国需要，我们将毫不吝惜地把自己的一切贡献给我们亲爱的祖国！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
