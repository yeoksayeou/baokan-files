    Under the brilliant illumination of the general line of our Party for socialist construction, and just as the people of all ethnic groups in our country are accelerating socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm, the fourth provincial-level ethnic autonomous region in our country—the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region—was officially proclaimed on October 25 in Yinchuan, the capital of the autonomous region. This is a great joyous event for our multi-ethnic country. We believe that the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will better embody the Party's ethnic policies in the Ningxia region. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia will further unite closely, working together with all their might, so that the economic and cultural construction of the entire region can advance at a higher speed.
    As early as 1956, the Party Central Committee proposed the establishment of a provincial-level Hui autonomous region in areas where the Hui people of Ningxia live in relatively large numbers. This initiative reflected the long-standing aspirations of the Hui people, and it also conformed to the common development interests of the Hui, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups in the region. Therefore, it was enthusiastically supported by the people of all ethnic groups and strongly supported by the people of the whole country. Now, this wish has become a reality. The most important task before the people of the autonomous region is to concentrate their main efforts on accelerating the development of economic and cultural undertakings while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, actively carrying out the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and building together with the people of the whole country by leaps and bounds.
    Accelerating socialist construction in the Ningxia region and striving to completely change the face of the autonomous region in the shortest possible time are possible because of extremely favorable conditions. In the few years since the national liberation, under the leadership of our Party and the People's Government, the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups in the Ningxia region have not only completed the democratic reforms, but have also basically completed the socialist transformation. Last year, they underwent a nationwide rectification campaign and socialist education movement, and recently, on the basis of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, they further realized the people's commune system in the countryside. Like the people of the whole country, the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia have been liberated from the shackles of the old system and old ideas. People are eagerly demanding to develop production, improve their material and cultural life, and completely change the state of poverty and blankness. Once the power of the masses is mobilized, it is endless. It can move mountains and seas, and it can turn all ideals into living reality. At the same time, Ningxia is rich in resources, with large plains and pastures, and a relatively developed water conservancy and irrigation system, which can develop agriculture and animal husbandry on a large scale. Underground resources include coal, iron, oil, copper, lead, zinc, and other minerals, and the potential for developing industry is very great. Since the comprehensive Great Leap Forward, the economic and cultural undertakings here have developed relatively rapidly. This year's grain output is more than double that of last year. From January to September this year alone, more than 9,300 large and small factories and mines have been newly built and rebuilt, which is equal to 95 times the original number of factories and mines. All this shows that as long as we further strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the people of all ethnic groups, it is entirely possible to develop the economic and cultural undertakings of the Ningxia region on a larger scale and more rapidly.
    Strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, especially the unity of the Hui and Han people, is of extremely great significance for accelerating the development of economic and cultural undertakings in the Ningxia region. The estrangement between the Hui and Han people caused by the oppression and alienation of the reactionary ruling class has become a thing of the past. After the national liberation, due to the implementation of the policies of ethnic equality, fraternity, and cooperation by our Party and government, the resolute opposition to bourgeois nationalism, and the widespread use of socialist ethnic unity to educate the people, the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups worked together, lived together, and struggled together to build socialism, and the unity between ethnic groups was unprecedentedly enhanced. In the future, in order to more rapidly promote socialist construction in the autonomous region, it is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth education on ethnic unity, resolutely oppose bad people and bad deeds that hinder the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, vigorously promote and advocate mutual assistance and cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups, and promote the communist spirit of cooperation among the people. After the realization of the people's commune system in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, many people's communes were jointly established by the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups, who worked together, lived together, and studied together. This is a favorable condition for further strengthening unity.
    Now, the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has brought the socialist construction of this region into a new historical period. Strengthening the leadership of the Party, implementing the Party's ethnic policies, and implementing the general line of socialist construction are the basic guarantees for consolidating and strengthening the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and enabling the people of all ethnic groups to move towards prosperity and happiness. In order to strengthen the leadership of the Party and deeply mobilize the masses, it is necessary to constantly pay attention to carrying out communist education for cadres, so that all ethnic groups within the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are united around the Party and, together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country, build our motherland into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    The birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is another major victory for the ethnic regional autonomy policy of our Party and government, and it is also a great victory for the unity and cooperation of the Hui and Han nationalities and all ethnic groups in the autonomous region! We believe that under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region will hold hands more closely, respect each other, unite closely, and work together to accelerate the pace of the autonomous region and achieve new and greater achievements in socialist construction!

    祝宁夏回族自治区成立
    在我们党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀之下，正当我国各族人民以冲天的干劲加速社会主义建设的时候，我国第四个省一级的民族自治区——宁夏回族自治区，10月25日在自治区的首府银川市正式宣告成立了。这对我们一个多民族的国家来说，是一件大喜事。我们相信，宁夏回族自治区的成立，将在宁夏地区更好地体现党的民族政策；宁夏各民族人民在党的统一领导下，将进一步亲密团结，把干劲拧成一股绳，使全区的经济和文化建设以更高的速度前进。
    党中央在1956年就提出了在宁夏回族人民聚居比较多的地方成立宁夏省一级回族自治区的建议。这个倡议反映了回族人民多年来的愿望，也符合区内回、汉、满、蒙古等各族人民共同发展的利益，因而得到各族人民的热诚拥护，也得到全国人民的大力支持。现在，这个愿望已经变成现实。摆在自治区人民面前的最主要的任务，就是要在继续完成政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，集中主要力量加速发展经济和文化事业，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，同全国人民一起大踏步地建设。
    加速宁夏地区的社会主义建设，争取在最短的时间内彻底改变自治区的面貌，这是有着极为有利的条件的。全国解放几年以来，在我们党和人民政府的领导之下，宁夏地区的回、汉等各族人民，不但已经完成了民主改革，而且已经基本上完成了社会主义改造，在去年又经过了全民整风和社会主义教育运动，最近更进而在全面大跃进的基础上实现了农村的人民公社化。同全国人民一样，宁夏各族人民已经从旧制度和旧思想的束缚下解放出来。人们迫切地要求发展生产，改善自己的物质和文化生活，彻底改变一穷二白的状况；而群众的力量一经发动起来，是无穷无尽的，它能移山倒海，它能把一切理想变成活生生的现实。同时，宁夏资源丰富，境内有大片的平原和牧场，有比较发达的水利灌溉系统，可以大规模地发展农业和畜牧业。地下资源有煤、铁、石油、铜、铅、锌等多种矿藏，发展工业的潜力是很大的。自从全面大跃进以来，这里的经济和文化事业有了比较迅速的发展，今年的粮食产量比去年提高一倍多；今年1至9月就新建和改建了大小厂矿九千三百多个，等于原有厂矿的九十五倍。所有这些都说明，只要更进一步地加强领导，把各族人民的积极性和主动性充分发动起来，更大规模地、更加迅速地发展宁夏地区的经济和文化事业是完全可能的。
    加强各族人民的团结、特别是回汉两族人民的团结，对于加速发展宁夏地区的经济和文化事业有着极其重大的意义。反动统治阶级的压迫和挑拨离间所造成的回汉两族人民之间的隔阂已成过去。全国解放以后，由于我们党和政府实行了民族平等、友爱和合作的政策，坚决反对了资产阶级民族主义，广泛地用社会主义民族团结的思想教育人民，回族、汉族和其他民族人民共同劳动，共同生活，共同为建设社会主义而奋斗，民族之间的团结空前增强。今后，为了更加迅速地推进自治区的社会主义建设，加强各族人民的团结，必须广泛深入地进行民族团结的教育，坚决反对妨碍各民族团结合作的坏人坏事，大力宣传和提倡各族人民之间互助合作，发扬人们的共产主义协作精神。在宁夏回族自治区实现人民公社化后，许多人民公社都是回汉等各族人民共同建立起来的，他们一起劳动，一起生活，一起学习。这是进一步加强团结的有利条件。
    现在，宁夏回族自治区的成立，使这个地区的社会主义建设进入了一个新的历史时期。加强党的领导，贯彻党的民族政策，执行社会主义建设总路线，是巩固和增强各族人民的团结，使各族人民走向富裕和幸福的基本保证。为了加强党的领导，深入发动群众，必须经常注意对干部进行共产主义教育，使宁夏回族自治区内部的各个民族团结在党的周围，同全国各族人民一起，把我们的祖国建设成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    宁夏回族自治区的诞生，是我们党和政府的民族区域自治政策的又一重大胜利，也是回汉民族和自治区内的各族人民团结合作的伟大胜利！我们相信，在党的领导下，自治区各族人民将更加亲密地携起手来，互相尊重，亲密团结，共同努力，一定使自治区更加加速前进的步伐，在社会主义建设上取得新的更大的成就！
