Mechanical Marshal Chases Steel Marshal
    By the end of September, the country had produced more than 4,500 iron-smelting blast furnaces, 1,838 steel-making furnaces, 530,000 kilowatts of steam and hydro-electric generators, and more than 52,500 machine tools.

    This Newspaper reports that in the first three quarters of this year, China's machinery industry has launched high-yield "satellites." The output of smelting equipment, power generation equipment and machine tools has greatly exceeded the production level of the entire last year. As of September 30, the country has produced more than 4,500 iron-smelting blast furnaces with a capacity of three cubic meters or more, and 1,838 various steel-making furnaces, providing the smelting industry with a production capacity of more than 15 million tons of iron and 12 million tons of steel per year. The output of various smelting equipment in September reached the highest level since this year. In this month, the output of blast furnaces exceeded 30% of the total output in the first eight months; the output of converters was equivalent to 276% of the total output from January to August, and the output of blowers also more than doubled.
    In order to ensure the realization of the great call of the Party Central Committee to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, all localities, from provinces, cities, enterprises to workshops, have personally taken charge by secretaries, formed smelting equipment production headquarters or leading groups, and mobilized all possible manufacturing forces. Liaoning Province organized and mobilized ten cities including Shenyang, Dalian, Jinzhou, and ten systems including machinery, mining, railways, and schools, and 139 major factories to launch an unprecedented large-scale collaborative production, and promoted the spirit of "one for all, all for one". For example, after Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Factory published a letter of request for waste steel in the Dalian Daily, all brother enterprises immediately took out more than 380 tons of waste steel they needed to support it.
    In this intense battle, the vast number of workers in the machinery industry have displayed soaring energy and unparalleled wisdom. Enterprise leaders moved to the front line, personally supervised the battle, and coordinated production with the masses to break through the key points. The broad masses created various forms of "ants gnawing at bones" and "teapot boiling pig heads" and other effective local methods to overcome the difficulties of processing large parts and casting large parts, shortening the manufacturing cycle of smelting equipment.
    While the smelting equipment production front has achieved a bumper harvest, good news has been pouring in from the power generation equipment and machine tool manufacturing. As of September 30, the country had produced 530,000 kilowatts of steam and hydro-electric generators; and more than 52,500 machine tools, including more than 800 large machine tools. In the last week of September, the national daily output of machine tools reached an unprecedented record of 830 units. Many factories launched "satellites" of advanced, precision, large, and cutting-edge products, and manufactured more than 60 kinds of major new products. Among them are 60,000-kilowatt hydro-electric generating equipment and 25,000-kilowatt thermal power generating equipment; 5-meter hobbing machines and program-controlled milling machines; 2,000-horsepower and 3,000-horsepower marine low-speed diesel engines, 98-horsepower free-piston gas turbine sets, internal combustion rock drills, and digital logic computers; In terms of heavy machinery, a 2,500-ton forging hydraulic press and a 150-ton bridge crane were successfully trial-produced; in order to meet the needs of agricultural tool bearingization, a high-efficiency simple steel ball rolling mill was successfully trial-produced. These major achievements mark that China's machinery industry is rapidly entering the world's advanced ranks.
    China's machinery industry has made amazing progress in the first nine months, but compared with this year's plan, power station equipment, blast furnaces and rolling mills are still far from being completed. Rolling equipment and power station equipment have not yet reached 50% of the annual plan. Some of the metallurgical equipment that has already been produced cannot be put into production immediately because some parts are not complete. In the fourth quarter, the national machinery manufacturing departments must not only catch up with production, strive to complete and advance the annual plan, solve the problem of complete equipment supply, but also strengthen the input to prepare for greater production leaps next year.

    机械元帅追赶钢帅
    到九月底，全国已生产炼铁高炉四千五百多座，炼钢炉一千八百三十八座，汽轮和水轮发电机五十三万瓩，机床五万二千五百多台。
    本报讯　我国机械工业今年前三个季度放出了高产“卫星”，冶炼设备，发电设备和机床的产量都已大大超过了去年全年的生产水平。至9月30日止，全国生产的三立方公尺以上的炼铁高炉已达四千五百多座，各种炼钢炉一千八百三十八座，为冶炼工业提供了年产一千五百多万吨铁和一千二百万吨钢的生产能力。9月份各种冶炼设备的产量更达到今年以来的最高水平，这个月高炉的产量超过了前八个月生产总和的30％；转炉产量相当于1至8月总产量的276％，鼓风机也超过了一倍多。
    各地为了确保实现党中央提出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的伟大号召，从省、市、企业直到车间都由书记亲自挂帅，组成了冶金设备生产指挥部或领导小组，调动了一切可以动员的制造力量。辽宁省就组织动员了沈阳、旅大、锦州等十个城市，机械、采矿、铁道、学校等十个系统一百三十九个主要工厂，展开了空前规模的协作生产，发扬了“我为人人，人人为我”的协作精神，如大连工矿车辆厂在旅大日报登出急需废钢铁的求援信后，各兄弟企业立即把自己需要的三百八十多吨废钢铁拿出支援。
    在这一紧张的战斗中，机械工业广大职工发挥出冲天的干劲和无比的智慧，企业领导搬到现场，亲自督战，同群众一起调度生产，突破关键。广大群众创造了各种形式的“蚂蚁啃骨头”“茶壶煮猪头”等立竿见影的土办法，克服了加工大件、铸造大件的困难，缩短了冶炼设备的制造周期。
    与冶炼设备生产战线获得丰收的同时，发电设备和机床制造捷报频传。至9月30日止，全国已生产出的汽轮和水轮发电机达五十三万瓩；机床五万二千五百多台，其中大型机床达八百多台。在9月最后一个星期全国机床日产量达到了八百三十台的空前纪录。许多工厂放出了高级、精密、大型和尖端产品的“卫星”，制造出重大新产品六十多种。其中有六万瓩的水轮发电设备和二万五千瓩的火力发电设备；有五公尺滚齿机、以及程序控制铣床；有二千马力和三千马力船用低速柴油机、九十八马力自由活塞燃气轮机组、内燃式凿岩机、数字逻辑计算机；重型机器方面试制成功了二千五百吨锻造水压机、一百五十吨桥式起重机；为满足农具轴承化的需要试制成功了高效率的简易钢球轧机。这些重大的成就，标志着我国机械工业正在迅速地迈入世界先进的行列。
    我国机械工业在前九个月中跃进速度是惊人的，但是比起今年的计划来，电站设备、高炉和轧钢机都还完成得很差，轧钢设备和电站设备还没有达到年计划50％。一些已经生产出来的冶金设备，由于还有一部分配不成套，也还不能立即投入生产。全国机械制造部门在第四季中，不仅要把产量赶上去，力争完成和提前全年的计划，解决设备的成套供应的问题，并且还要为明年的更大生产跃进做好准备工作，加强投料。（附图片）
