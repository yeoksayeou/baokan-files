Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th. Anhui Province's more than 3.7 million mu of cotton fields have yielded an unprecedented bumper harvest. The estimated total output could reach 3 million dan, doubling last year's output. The average yield per mu is over 80 jin, an increase of 150% over last year.

Currently, cotton plants in general cotton fields across the province are about three chi tall, laden with flowers and bolls. The cotton plants in the 17,000-plus mu of high-yield cotton fields are even more vigorous, with plant height exceeding four chi five cun, and an average of more than 25 fruiting branches. Early-sown cotton has now been more than half harvested, and ordinary cotton has been more than one-third harvested. In Yingshang County, the Shuguang Brigade of the Chengjiao People's Commune has basically completed the harvesting of six mu of cotton, collecting a total of 14,562 jin of ginned cotton, an average yield of 2,427 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In Chaoxian County, the 27,000-plus mu of cotton in Fuxing Township is expected to yield an average of over 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

This year, Anhui's unprecedented bumper cotton harvest is primarily the result of breaking superstitions and liberating thought. Various regions have changed the old habit of only planting cotton on sandy soil and have also extensively planted cotton on alluvial soil and other types of land. All cotton-growing areas have also universally overturned the past assertion that cotton cannot be pruned or side-shooted, and have carried out pruning and side-shooting, causing the cotton plants to bear more bolls.

    安徽棉花大丰收
    总产量比去年增产二倍
    据新华社合肥17日电　安徽省三百七十多万亩棉花空前大丰收。预计总产量可达三百万担，比去年增产两倍。平均亩产在八十斤以上，比去年提高一倍半。
    目前，各地一般棉田的棉株高三尺左右，花桃累累。一万七千多亩丰产棉田的棉花长得更旺盛，株高超过四尺五寸，果枝平均在二十五个以上。早播的棉花现在已收一半以上。一般的已收三分之一以上。颖上县城郊人民公社曙光大队六亩棉花已基本收完，共收皮棉一万四千五百六十二斤，平均亩收皮棉二千四百二十七斤。巢县复兴乡两万七千多亩棉花，预计平均每亩可收皮棉千斤以上。
    今年，安徽棉花空前丰收，首先是打破迷信，解放思想的结果。各地改变了只有沙土地才能种棉的老习惯，在淤土等地也大量种植棉花，各棉区还普遍地推翻了过去棉花不能整枝打杈的论调，进行整枝打杈，使棉株多结棉桃。
