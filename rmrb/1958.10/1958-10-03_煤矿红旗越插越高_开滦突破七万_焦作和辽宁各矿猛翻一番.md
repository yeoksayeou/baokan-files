The red flag of coal mines flies higher and higher.
Kailuan breaks through 70,000 tons, Jiaozuo and Liaoning mines more than double their output.
    This newspaper reports: After releasing a satellite of daily output of over 55,000 tons on the 26th, the Kailuan Mining Bureau reached a daily output of 70,545 tons on the 29th. This is a 99% increase compared to the average daily output in August. The 5299 workface of the Tangjiazhuang Mine set another world coal mining record, extracting 60,000 tons of coal in twenty-nine days, an 88.79% increase over the world record set in June.
    This newspaper reports: On September 29th, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine produced 22,747 tons of coal, a 157.2% increase over the average daily output in the national plan and a 127.5% increase over the average daily output in August.
    After airing their views and debating, all mine workers put forward the slogan "Double steel, increase coal tenfold, produce coal and steel quickly, and defeat the American imperialist wolves." The Xiaomacun Inclined Shaft and No. 39 Shaft adopted twelve measures to increase coal production, increasing the daily output of each mine from over 1,000 tons to over 4,000 tons, more than three times their designed capacity. National model worker Liu Jiuxue's coal mining team and the workers of the New Second Team overcame difficulties in the working face and increased daily output to over 1,800 tons. (Liu Tonggui)
    This newspaper reports: On September 29th, all coal mine workers in Liaoning Province released a high-yield satellite of 213,000 tons (including local mines), an increase of 1.08 times over the average daily output in August. Among them, the Cai Tun Mine of the Benxi Bureau, which produces coking coal, increased by 1.65 times, the Benxi Mine increased by nearly one time, the Beipiao Bureau increased by 1.38 times, and the Fushun Bureau increased by 1.01 times. The Fuxin Bureau, which produces important industrial coal, increased by 1.07 times. The output of local coal mines has also greatly increased.
