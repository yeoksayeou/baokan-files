Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 13th: A conference of all-Soviet drama workers, playwrights, and drama critics was held in Moscow from October 7th to 11th. The conference focused on the issue of drama reflecting modern life.

Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Furtseva read out the congratulatory message from the CPSU Central Committee to the conference. The congratulatory message emphasized that Soviet dramatic art is incompatible with formalism and any other tendency that deviates from socialist realism. It is a truly people's art that is close to and understood by the broad masses of working people. The glorious duty of Soviet drama workers is to reflect the great events of our time in artistic works, to reflect the fundamental changes taking place in our reality, especially in recent years, and to express the entire rich spiritual life and creative activities of the Soviet people.

The congratulatory message pointed out that artists should also expose the old remnants in people's consciousness, manifestations of conservatism, selfishness, and departmentalism, the ideological influence of private ownership, and expose everything that hinders the building of a communist society.

Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov delivered a report at the meeting entitled "The Tasks of Soviet Drama in the Current Stage."

Mikhailov said that Soviet drama is a product of the socialist revolution. The new dramatic art has been consolidated and grown up in the resolute struggle against various ideological enemies.

Speaking of the themes of drama, Mikhailov emphasized that Soviet audiences want to see works on stage that conform to their inner state and reflect life with artistic tools. However, he pointed out that there are still not many dramas on the theater stage that are in harmony with the people's lives. He said that dramatists should depict the Communist Party, labor, scientific achievements, youth, and should help peaceful forces and ruthlessly strike at the instigators of new wars.

Speaking of the science of dramatic theory, Mikhailov emphasized that revisionism is the main danger on the ideological front. Revisionism attempts to attack socialist realism as an artistic method.

He also said that it is very clear that revisionists are particularly frantically attacking the principle of the Party's leadership of art. The entire history of the emergence and development of Soviet literature and art convincingly proves that the strength of our literature and art lies in the Party's leadership.

Writer Lavrenyov reported on the status and tasks of modern Soviet drama. He said that modern themes are the basis of the repertoire. Genuine and vivid modern themes, patriotism and Party spirit, and a focus on the ordinary people who create history have always been the characteristics of Soviet drama.

He said that truthfully reflecting reality in art and the writer's deep understanding of life are of particular significance now. A true understanding of life and true artistic truth are inconceivable without a clear Party stance.

He finally pointed out that among the huge and important tasks facing Soviet playwrights, the main task—reflecting today's, modern reality—has not yet become the main direction in the theatrical world. He called on Soviet playwrights to pay more and more attention to the lives of the people.

The meeting then launched a heated discussion on the two reports. The delegates finally adopted a letter to the CPSU Central Committee, guaranteeing to do everything possible to create works that truthfully and vividly reflect the cause and achievements of the Soviet people.

    舞台应该成为生活的镜子
    苏联举行全国戏剧工作会议
    肯定戏剧必须反映现代生活
    新华社莫斯科13日电　全苏戏剧工作者、剧作家和戏剧批评家会议10月7日到11日在莫斯科举行。这次会议着重讨论了戏剧反映现代生活的问题。
    苏共中央书记福尔采娃在会议期间宣读了苏共中央给会议的贺词。贺词强调指出，苏联戏剧艺术同形式主义倾向和任何其他脱离社会主义现实主义的倾向是格格不入的，它是接近广大劳动群众并为他们所理解的真正人民艺术。苏联戏剧工作者的光荣职责就是在艺术作品中反映当代的伟大事件，反映我们的现实中所发生的、特别是在近几年来发生的根本变化，表现苏维埃人的整个丰富的精神生活和创造性活动。
    贺词指出，艺术工作者还应当揭露人们意识中的旧的残余，因循保守、自私自利、本位主义的表现，私有制的思想影响，揭露一切妨碍建设共产主义社会的东西。
    苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫在会上作了题为“苏联戏剧事业在现阶段的任务”的报告。
    米哈伊洛夫说，苏联戏剧事业是社会主义革命的产物。新的戏剧艺术是在同各种思想敌人的坚决斗争中巩固和成长起来的。
    谈到戏剧的主题时，米哈伊洛夫着重指出，苏联观众愿意在舞台上看到符合他们内心状况、以艺术工具反映生活的作品。但是，他指出，在剧院舞台上同人民生活协调的戏剧还不多。他说，戏剧家应当描写共产党、劳动、科学成就、青年，应当帮助和平力量而无情打击新战争挑拨者。
    谈到戏剧理论科学时，米哈伊洛夫强调指出，修正主义是思想战线上的主要危险。修正主义力图进攻作为艺术方法的社会主义现实主义。
    他还说，修正主义者特别疯狂攻击党领导艺术这一原则，这是十分清楚的。苏联文学艺术的产生和发展的整个历史都令人信服地证明，我们文学艺术的力量就在于党的领导。
    作家拉夫列涅夫在会上报告了现代苏联戏剧事业的状况和任务。他说，现代主题是剧目单的基础。真正的和生动的现代主题、爱国主义和党性、对创造历史的普通人的集中注意，一直是苏维埃戏剧的特点。
    他说，在艺术中忠实地反映真实、作家深刻地理解生活，在现在具有特别的意义。真正认识生活、真正的艺术真实，没有明确的党的立场是不可思议的。
    他最后指出，在苏联剧作家面临的一些巨大而重要的任务中，主要的任务——反映今天的、现代的现实——还没有成为戏剧界中主要方向。他要求苏联剧作家越来越集中地注意人民的生活。
    会议随后就这两个报告展开了热烈的讨论。会议代表们最后通过了给苏共中央的信，保证尽一切力量创作真实而生动反映苏维埃人的事业和功绩的作品。
