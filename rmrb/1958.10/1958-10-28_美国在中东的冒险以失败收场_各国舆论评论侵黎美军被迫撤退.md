Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 27th. The Polish "People's Tribune" commented today on the withdrawal of American and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, writing: "The second armed intervention by Western countries against the Arab people in the past two years has met its deserved end. The withdrawal of the last American soldier from Lebanon actually signifies the end of the 'Eisenhower Doctrine'."

The commentary stated that the withdrawal of the intervention forces could normalize the internal situation in Lebanon, Jordan, and the entire Arab East, and would be conducive to easing the international situation. It is clear to everyone that if the Americans also withdraw their armed forces from the Taiwan Strait and cease their intervention there, the dangerous situation in the Far East could also be quickly eliminated, the world situation would be greatly improved, and favorable conditions could be created to study and resolve other pressing issues, including disarmament.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th. "Al-Gomhouria" published an editorial today saying that the forced withdrawal of the American and British occupation forces from Lebanon and Jordan is another shameful failure for the imperialists following the shameful defeat suffered during the tripartite aggression by Britain, France, and Israel.

The newspaper said that the people of all countries now hope that the imperialist countries have learned a lesson and realize that the era of aggression is gone forever, and that the will of the people of all countries, who are now much stronger than imperialism, cannot be challenged.

"Al-Shaab" said that the American imperialist adventure in the Middle East, just as expected from the beginning, ended in failure. People had long predicted that this adventure, like the tripartite aggression against Egypt, would end in complete failure. This proves that aggression cannot bring them anything.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th. "Al-Youm" and "Al-Nour" published editorials today commenting on the forced withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon under pressure from around the world.

"Al-Youm" said: The withdrawal of American troops "firstly proves that the era in which strong countries were accustomed to controlling the fate of weak countries, and imperialist countries could arbitrarily send troops to invade small countries, is gone forever."

"Al-Nour" said that the American armed occupation of Lebanon was the "darkest" chapter in Lebanese history, and that the withdrawal of these occupation forces was a great victory for the Lebanese people, all its groups, parties, and national organizations, the result of their struggle, and the result of Arab and global solidarity with Lebanon.

The newspaper said that the invaders "withdrew amidst the curses of the Lebanese people and every Arab."

The newspaper also called on the Lebanese people and national forces to unite and remain vigilant in order to defeat the new conspiracies of the imperialists and their agents against them.

    美国在中东的冒险以失败收场
    各国舆论评论侵黎美军被迫撤退
    新华社华沙27日电　波兰“人民论坛报”今天评论美英军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤军的问题时写道：“最近两年中西方国家对阿拉伯人民的第二次武装干涉得到了应有的结局。最后一个美国兵的撤出黎巴嫩，实际上意味着‘艾森豪威尔主义’的完蛋。”
    评论说，干涉军的撤退能够使黎巴嫩、约旦和整个阿拉伯东方内部局势正常化，并且有利于缓和国际局势。有一点是大家都清楚的：如果美国人也把自己的武装部队撤出台湾海峡，并且停止在那里的干涉，那末远东的危险局势也就很快地可以消除，世界局势就会大大好转，并且可以造成有利条件来研究和解决其他迫切问题，其中包括裁军问题。
    新华社开罗26日电　“共和国报”今天发表社论说，美英占领军被迫从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退，是帝国主义者继在英法以三国侵略遭受的可耻失败以后又一次遭到可耻的失败。
    这家报纸说，各国人民现在希望帝国主义国家已经得到教训，认识侵略时代是一去不复返了，现在比帝国主义强大得多的世界各国人民的意志是不容许挑战的。
    “人民报”说，美帝国主义在中东的冒险正像一开始所预料的那样是以失败收场了，人们早就预料，这次冒险正像三国对埃及的侵略一样会在彻底的失败中结束。这就证明侵略不能给它们带来任何东西。
    新华社大马士革26日电　“今天报”和“光明报”今天发表社论评论美国军队在全世界的压力下被迫从黎巴嫩撤退这件事。
    “今天报”说：美国军队撤退这件事“首先证明强国惯于支配弱国的命运、帝国主义国家可以任意派军队侵略小国的时代已经一去不复返了。
    “光明报”说，美国武装占领黎巴嫩是黎巴嫩历史上“最黑暗的”一章，这些占领军的撤退是黎巴嫩人民、它的所有团体、党派和全国性组织的伟大胜利，是它们的斗争的成果，是阿拉伯和全世界声援黎巴嫩的结果。
    这家报纸说，侵略者“是在黎巴嫩人民和每一个阿拉伯人的诅咒声中撤退的”。
    这家报纸还要求黎巴嫩人民和民族力量团结一致，保持警惕，以击败帝国主义者和他们的代理人对付他们的新阴谋。
