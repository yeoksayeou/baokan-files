Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese People’s Association for Cultural Relation with Foreign Countries, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, and the Red Cross Society of China today sent a telegram to the Japanese National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, congratulating the opening of the conference on the 8th. The text is as follows: National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament:

    On the occasion of the Japanese people from all walks of life holding the National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, we would like to extend our warm congratulations to your conference.

    At a time when the United States is using military bases in Japan to continuously expand its interference in the Taiwan Strait region and carry out military provocations, the Japanese people from all walks of life are convening the National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, which will not only help the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, but also make important contributions to peace in Asia and the world.

    The determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, which have always been Chinese territories, cannot be hindered by any external forces. It is the Chinese people's own business, and it is China's internal affair, to liberate their own territory at an appropriate time and in an appropriate manner, that is, through peaceful negotiations or other means. No foreign interference is allowed. At present, the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region is caused by the United States' blatant interference. The Japanese people and the people of Asian countries are increasingly aware that U.S. imperialism, which is far away in the Eastern Pacific, has come to the Western Pacific under the pretext of "defense" to carry out military provocations, occupy Taiwan and Penghu, expand its aggression to Jinmen and Mazu, and occupy Okinawa and other areas in Japan. It is the only source of threat to peace in Asia.

    On October 6, Mr. Akira Kazami, head of the Japanese Delegation of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Mr. Jiichiro Matsumoto, head of the Japanese-Chinese Friendship Association Delegation, Mr. Yoshitaro Hirano, deputy head, and Mr. Tomitaro Kaneda, head of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Delegation, who are currently on a friendly visit to China, unanimously pointed out that the United States must withdraw from the Taiwan Strait region. It is the common goal of the Asian people to withdraw US troops from Taiwan, from the mainland of Japan, Okinawa, South Korea and other places. Asian affairs should be handled by Asians. Only in this way can peace in Asia and the world be guaranteed.

    At present, the United States is using Japan as a supply base and an atomic strategic base for its aggression and war, while the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is following U.S. imperialism in implementing a policy of hostility towards China and obstructing the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. On the Taiwan issue, it is also cooperating with the United States to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy, which the Chinese people resolutely oppose.

    Recently, peace-loving Japanese people have launched a national movement demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government abandon its policy of hostility towards China, abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the "Japan-Chiang Treaty", and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. They have also launched extensive struggles to win Japan's national independence, freedom, democracy and peace. The Chinese people will vigorously support the just struggle of the Japanese people and thank the peace-loving Japanese people for their support for the Chinese people's opposition to U.S. imperialist aggression and the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu Islands, and Jinmen and Mazu.

    We wish the conference a success.

          Congratulatory Telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions today sent a telegram to the Japanese "National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament," congratulating the opening of the conference on the 8th.

    The telegram stated that we are pleased to see that Japanese workers and people are increasingly strongly demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the strengthening of friendly relations, and opposing the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which follows the U.S. war policy and is blindly hostile to China. Recently, the joint statement issued by our association and the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, reflects the common demands and wishes of the working class and people of China and Japan, and is also a solid foundation for further strengthening friendly unity.

    U.S. imperialism's creation of a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait not only threatens China's security, but also seriously undermines peace in the Far East, thereby placing Japan, which is in a state of semi-occupation by the United States, in an even more precarious position. Japanese workers and people have deeply realized from their own experiences that U.S. imperialism, which occupies Okinawa on Japanese territory and deprives the Japanese nation of its sovereignty, is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government is willing to act as a pawn of the United States, allowing the U.S. military to use Japanese military bases, and stepping up the nuclear armament of the Japanese military in order to realize its ambition to revive militarism, which will drive the Japanese people into the abyss of a more disastrous war once again.

    We fully support the struggle of Japanese workers and people to win national independence and democratic freedom, oppose nuclear armament, demand the strengthening of Sino-Japanese people's friendship, and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. We firmly believe that you will unite to overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous development and victory in the struggle.

    Congratulatory Telegram from Six Japanese Visiting Delegations

    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Six Japanese visiting delegations sent a telegram back to Japan on the 6th, congratulating the "National Conference on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament" on its opening on the 8th. The text is as follows:

    We were invited to participate in the celebration of the 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is in an unprecedented Great Leap Forward.

    We have seen that despite the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards China, the Chinese people's friendship towards the Japanese people is firm and unwavering. We have also personally experienced that the Chinese people, with a strong will and unwavering confidence, are determined to smash U.S. imperialist aggression and defend peace.

    We have been fighting for Japan's independence, peace, and Japan-China friendship. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government follows U.S. imperialism, is hostile to China, adopts a series of reactionary fascist policies at home, and supports the United States' aggressive policies in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The Kishi Nobusuke government, in collusion with the United States, separates the Taiwan issue from the armed interference in Jinmen and Mazu, and conspires to create two Chinas, and infringes upon China's sovereignty by submitting the Taiwan issue to the United Nations, which we resolutely oppose. We demand that U.S. troops must withdraw from the Taiwan region first.

    Your conference demands the opening of Japan-China relations, the banning of nuclear armament, and the struggle against the common enemies of the people of Japan and China. We wish your conference brilliant achievements. We will also certainly fight with you with hope and confidence.

    反对美国侵略政策  促进中日人民友好
    中日两国人民共同斗争互相支持
    我国人民团体和日本六个访华代表团电贺打开日中关系和禁止核武装大会
    中国外交学会等五个团体的贺电
    新华社7日讯　中国人民外交学会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国红十字会今天打电报给日本打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会，祝贺大会在8日开幕，文如下：打开中日关系和禁止核武装国民大会：
    值此日本各界举行打开中日关系和禁止核武装国民大会之际，我们谨向贵大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    在美国利用日本的军事基地对台湾海峡地区不断扩大干涉，进行军事挑衅的时候，日本各界人民召开打开中日关系和禁止核武装国民大会，不仅有助于中日两国人民的友好，而且对亚洲和世界和平也将作出重要的贡献。
    中国人民要求解放从来就是中国的领土台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖的决心，是任何外力所不能阻挠的。中国人民在适当时机，用适当的方式即用和平谈判或其他方式解放自己的领土，是中国人民自己的事情，是中国的内政问题，绝不容许外国进行任何干涉。目前，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势是美国进行蛮横的干涉所造成的。日本人民和亚洲各国人民日益清楚的认识到，远在东太平洋的美国帝国主义跑到西太平洋来借口“防卫”进行军事挑衅，侵占台湾、澎湖、扩大侵略到金门马祖，霸占日本的冲绳和其他地区，是威胁亚洲和平的唯一根源。
    10月6日，正在中国进行友好访问的日本恢复日中邦交国民会议代表团团长风见章、日本中国友好协会代表团团长松本治一郎、副团长平野义太郎、日本工会总评议会代表团团长兼田富太郎等先生曾一致指出美国必须从台湾海峡地区撤退。使美军从台湾撤出，从日本本土、冲绳、南朝鲜等地撤出，是亚洲人民共同斗争的目标。亚洲的事务应由亚洲人处理。只有这样，亚洲和世界和平才能得到保证。
    目前，美国正在利用日本做为其推行侵略战争的补给基地和原子战略基地，而日本岸信介政府正在追随美国帝国主义执行敌视中国、阻挠中日关系正常化的政策，在台湾问题上，又配合美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，这是中国人民坚决反对的。
    最近以来，爱好和平的日本人民掀起要求岸信介政府放弃敌视中国的政策、废除日美“安全条约”和“日蒋条约”，促进中日邦交正常化的国民运动，并且为争取日本民族独立、自由、民主和和平展开了广泛的斗争。中国人民将大力支持日本人民的正义斗争，并感谢日本爱好和平人民对中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，解放台湾澎湖列岛和金门马祖的支持。

          中华全国总工会的贺电
    新华社7日讯　中华全国总工会今天打电报给日本“打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会”，祝贺这个大会8日开会。
    电报中说，我们高兴地看到，日本工人和人民越来越强烈地要求与中国恢复邦交和加强友好关系，反对岸信介政府追随美国战争政策和一味敌视中国的反动政策。最近，我会与总评访华代表团发表的联合声明，反映了中日两国工人阶级和人民的共同要求和愿望，也是进一步加强友好团结的巩固基础。
    美帝国主义在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，不仅威胁中国的安全，而且严重地破坏远东的和平，从而使在美国半占领状态下的日本陷于更加不安的地位。日本工人和人民已从切身的体会中深刻地认识到，霸占日本国土冲绳、剥夺日本民族主权的美帝国主义，是日本人民和中国人民的共同敌人。岸信介政府甘心充当美国的走卒，容许美国军队使用日本的军事基地，加紧进行日本军队的核武装，以实现其复活军国主义的野心，这将驱使日本人民再一次陷于更加灾难的战争的深渊。
    我们完全支持日本工人和人民争取民族独立和民主自由、反对核武装、要求加强中日人民友好和恢复中日邦交的斗争，并深信你们将团结一致地克服各种困难，使斗争获得不断的发展和胜利。
    日本六个访华代表团的贺电
    新华社7日讯　日本六个访华代表团6日打电报回日本，祝贺“打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会”在8日开会，文如下：
    我们应邀参加了中华人民共和国建国九周年国庆节。中华人民共和国正处在史无前例的大跃进中。
    我们看到，尽管岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，但中国人民对于日本人民的友谊是坚定而不变的。我们还亲身体会到，中国人民抱着坚强的意志和不可动摇的信心，坚决粉碎美帝国主义的侵略，保卫和平。
    我们一直为日本的独立、和平与日中友好而斗争。但是，岸信介政府追随美帝国主义，敌视中国，在国内采取一系列的反动法西斯政策，并且支持美国在台湾和台湾海峡的侵略政策。岸信介政府伙同美国，把台湾问题和对金门、马祖的武装干涉分割开来，阴谋制造两个中国，并且侵害中国的主权，要把台湾问题提交联合国，我们对此是坚决反对的。我们要求，首先美军必须从台湾地区撤退。
    贵大会要求打开日中关系，禁止核武装，向日中两国人民的共同敌人进行斗争。祝贵大会获得光辉的成就。我们也一定抱着希望和信心，同你们一道进行斗争。　恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团
