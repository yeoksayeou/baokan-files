Farewell at the Foot of Mount Myohyang
Lei Ju
　　The mountains and fields are just waking, the morning mist is like smoke, who is it, carrying a Korean small hoe, gently calling at the roadside wicker door?
Dear cooperative chairman:
　　There are thousands of acres of good fields on this Mount Myohyang, on which piece can we write down
　　The parting words of a thousand languages,
　　The friendly words of ten thousand languages? (with picture)

    妙香山下告别
    雷炬山野初醒，朝雾如烟，是谁提着朝鲜小锄头，将路旁的荆扉轻唤？亲爱的合作社社长：这妙香山上良田千万，哪一块能让我们写下
  临别的千言万语，
  友谊的万语千言？（附图片）
