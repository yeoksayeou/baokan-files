Consolidating Communes Through Communist Education
He Zhuo

The report in this newspaper on October 7 concerning the Communist education movement being carried out in Guangxi and Zhejiang raised the following question: Should the method of conducting a Communist education movement be used to consolidate and elevate the people's communes? Guangxi, precisely because it extensively and deeply carried out the Communist education movement, criticized individualism and departmentalism among its members, and immediately spurred the rise of the Communist spirit.

This question is raised very well. The fact that the rural areas across the country basically achieved the people's commune system in a very short time indeed illustrates that the people's commune is the inevitable trend of the current situation's development. However, this does not mean that there is no struggle in this movement. "On Contradiction" tells us that all things have contradictions and struggles, which cause the movement and development of things. The people's commune movement is no exception. This contradiction and struggle is the contradiction and struggle between collectivism and communism versus individualism and departmentalism. In the process of establishing communes, it is necessary to fight against individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideology, which hinder the people's commune movement. In future consolidation and improvement work, individualism, departmentalism, and capitalist ideology will still create mischief, and the struggle will continue.

To oppose these individualistic, departmentalistic, and capitalist ideas, although not very difficult, is also not something that can be done in a day or two. Individualism and departmentalism are like stubborn scabies; if they are eliminated today, they reappear tomorrow; if they are eliminated here, they reappear there. Does this mean that individualism and departmentalism can never be eliminated? No. It simply means that for individualism and departmentalism, long-term patient persuasive education methods, and methods of Communist ideological education, must be used. Only when each member has Communist ideology can individualism and departmentalism truly disappear. This is the situation in Guangxi and Zhejiang. Before Communist education was carried out, individualism and departmentalism created mischief; after education, the Communist spirit soared.

Consolidating and improving the people's communes relies on developing production on the one hand, and on improving the Communist awareness of the members on the other. From the current situation, the latter is more important. This is not only because, at present, when dealing with various specific economic problems, each member needs to treat them with a Communist spirit, and in the future gradual transition to ownership by the whole people and the Communist distribution system, each member's Communist ideological awareness needs to be continuously improved; it is also because, in developing production, it is necessary to use Communist ideology as a guiding ideology, and it is necessary to universally establish a Communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. Only when Communist ideology is firmly established, that is, only when a firm Communist worldview is possessed, can one have lofty ideals, can one have a spirit of selfless devotion and fearlessness, can one discover the truth and adhere to the truth, and can one continuously revolutionize and move forward forever.

In the past, because we carried out the socialist and Communist education movement, today's people's commune movement appeared. In the future, we can only continue to carry out the Communist education movement, and the people's communes can be consolidated and improved in the vigorous mass movement.

    用共产主义教育来巩固公社
    何卓
    十月七日本报关于广西、浙江开展共产主义教育运动的报道中，提出了这样一个问题：应当用开展共产主义教育运动的方法，来巩固和提高人民公社。广西就因为广泛地深入地开展了共产主义教育运动，社员中的个人主义、本位主义受到批判，共产主义精神立即高涨。
    这个问题提得很对。全国农村在很短的时间内，基本上实现了人民公社化的事实，的确说明了人民公社是目前形势发展的必然趋势。但是，这不等于说，在这个运动中，就没有什么斗争了。“矛盾论”告诉我们：任何事物都有矛盾斗争，从而引起了事物的运动和发展。在人民公社化运动中，也不例外。这种矛盾斗争，就是集体主义、共产主义同个人主义、本位主义的矛盾斗争。在建立公社的过程中，一定要同阻挠人民公社运动的个人主义、本位主义和资本主义思想作斗争。在今后的巩固、提高工作中，个人主义本位主义和资本主义思想也还会兴妖作怪，斗争还要继续进行。
    要反掉这一些个人主义本位主义和资本主义思想，虽然不十分困难，但也不是一天两天所能做到的事情。个人主义本位主义就像顽固的疥癣一样，今天反掉了，明天又冒出来了，在这里反掉了，在那里又冒出来了。这样说，是不是个人主义本位主义，永远反不掉了呢？不是。这只是说，对于个人主义本位主义要用长期耐心的说服教育方法，要用共产主义思想教育的方法。每个社员有了共产主义思想，个人主义本位主义才能真正消失。广西、浙江的情形就是如此。在没有进行共产主义教育之前，个人主义本位主义作怪，在教育之后，共产主义精神高涨。
    巩固和提高人民公社，一方面依靠发展生产，另一方面依靠社员共产主义觉悟的提高。从目前情况来看，后者更为重要。这不仅仅因为目前处理各种具体经济问题时，需要每个社员以共产主义精神来对待，在今后逐步过渡到全民所有制和共产主义的分配制度的过程中，需要每个社员的共产主义思想觉悟不断提高；就是在发展生产中，也需要用共产主义思想来作指导思想，也需要普遍树立起敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。只有共产主义思想牢固地树立起来，也就是说只有具有了坚定的共产主义人生观，才能有远大的理想，才能有大公无私、大无畏的精神，才能发现真理坚持真理，才能不断革命，永远前进。
    过去，因为我们开展了社会主义共产主义教育运动，出现了今天的人民公社运动。今后，我们也只有继续开展共产主义教育运动，人民公社才能在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中巩固和提高。
