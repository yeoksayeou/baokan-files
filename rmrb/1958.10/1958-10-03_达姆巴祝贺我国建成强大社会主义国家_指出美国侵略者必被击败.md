Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 1st: At a reception held by Xie Fusheng, the Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia, on October 1st to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Damba, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said that the Mongolian people strongly protested against the armed provocations of American imperialism against China and fully supported all the measures taken by the Chinese government to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands. He said that the American aggressors would be defeated by the growing forces of peace. Speaking of the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people, Damba said that China's selfless assistance had contributed to Mongolia's socialist construction.

In his speech, Damba also congratulated the Chinese people on rapidly changing the backwardness of the old semi-colonial China in a short period of time and building a powerful socialist country.

Ambassador Xie Fusheng said at the reception that recently, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese people, American imperialism instructed the Chiang Kai-shek air force to attack the Chinese air force with missiles. The Chinese people must resolutely strike at this crime. He said that if American imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, this paper tiger, which was beaten badly on the Korean battlefield, will once again be severely hit.

In his speech, Xie Fusheng also thanked the Mongolian people for their support for China's socialist construction and for their support for the just struggle of the Chinese people.

Among those attending the reception were Mongolian party and government leaders such as Sambuu, Tsende, Dugersuren, and Balzhinnyam, heads of various people's organizations, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Mongolia, totaling about 400 people.

    达姆巴祝贺我国建成强大社会主义国家
    指出美国侵略者必被击败
    据新华社乌兰巴托1日电　蒙古人民革命党中央第一书记达姆巴1日在中国驻蒙古大使谢甫生举行的庆祝中国国庆九周年的招待会上说，蒙古人民严厉抗议美帝国主义对中国的武装挑衅，并且全力支持中国政府为解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿所采取的一切措施。他说，美国侵略者将为日益增长的和平力量所击败。在谈到中蒙两国人民的友谊时，达姆巴说，中国的无私援助对蒙古的社会主义建设作出了贡献。
    达姆巴在讲话中还祝贺中国人民在短期内迅速改变了旧中国半殖民地的落后面貌建成为一个强大的社会主义国家。
    谢甫生大使在招待会上讲话说，最近美帝国主义不顾中国人民的一再警告，竟指使蒋介石空军使用导弹向中国空军进攻，中国人民对此罪行一定要给予坚决的打击。他说，美帝国主义如果胆敢把战争强加在中国人民的头上，这只曾经在朝鲜战场上被打得头破血流的纸老虎一定会再次受到沉重的打击。
    谢甫生在讲话中还感谢蒙古人民对中国社会主义建设的支援和对中国人民正义斗争的支持。
    出席招待会的有桑布、曾德、杜格苏伦、巴尔吉尼雅姆等蒙古党政领导人，各人民团体的负责人，各国驻蒙古的外交使节等共约四百人。
