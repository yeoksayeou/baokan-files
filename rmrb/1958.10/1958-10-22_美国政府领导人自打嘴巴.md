    U.S. Government Leaders Contradict Themselves
    Editor's Note: The American "New York Post" published an editorial on October 16 entitled "Washington's Battle." This editorial listed a series of facts, pointing out that the recent remarks by Eisenhower and Dulles on the Taiwan Strait issue were full of "contradiction and confusion."
      Why are the words of the U.S. government leaders so inconsistent and contradictory? The "New York Post" did not answer this question. However, it is not difficult to find the reasons in some other American newspapers. This is: The Chinese people's firm determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Ma disrupted the U.S. government's conspiracy to set fire in the Taiwan Strait while forcing the Chinese people to "cease fire"; the U.S. aggressive policy has been met with fierce opposition at home and abroad. The incoherent remarks of Eisenhower and Dulles reflect the embarrassing situation of the U.S. government, which encounters difficulties in pursuing an aggressive policy but is unwilling to give it up.
    In order to let everyone see the current embarrassing and shameless faces of Eisenhower and Dulles, we publish the summary of the "New York Post" editorial below.

    Here are the contradictions and confusions that have recently appeared in the capital of this country (the United States)...

    Dulles Refutes Dulles on the Jinmen Issue

    Three weeks ago (September 25), Dulles told the world that Jinmen was as important to the U.S. political position in the Far East as Berlin was in Europe (referring to the West). Two weeks ago, on September 30, he announced that it was foolish for Chiang Kai-shek to station so many troops in Jinmen, because it was not very important for the defense of Formosa (referring to Taiwan). He said he would approve of reducing the troops if the Communists stopped shelling. On the 14th, he said that the United States had no policy on the issue of troop reduction at all. This is entirely a military issue and Chiang Kai-shek's personal matter.

    Eisenhower Refutes Dulles on the Jinmen Issue

    President Eisenhower said on the 15th that he would welcome the Kuomintang (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) voluntarily reducing the troops in Jinmen.

    Eisenhower Refutes Dulles on (Domestic) Politics

    Dulles said at his press conference on the 14th that he did not object to debating the basic principles of foreign policy in the election campaign, but he did not think it was a good thing to debate the current situation.

    Eisenhower said at his press conference on the 15th that no debate should be launched on comprehensive and general policies, but he expected that those who criticized the government would not fail to attack certain actions taken according to the general foreign policy decisions.

    Dulles Refutes Dulles on (Domestic) Politics

    Dulles criticized Vice President Nixon's accusations on the 14th, Nixon said: "The Acheson-Truman foreign policy caused the war, and the Eisenhower-Dulles policy caused peace." He said that these words did not conform to what he considered to be a "calm and composed" debate.

    Dulles issued a correction on the 15th, explaining that he did not criticize Nixon at all. Dulles said that Nixon was answering the "foreign policy challenge" issued by the Democratic Foreign Policy Advisory Committee on the 12th, and the Vice President's rhetoric was obviously justified.

### 美国政府领导人自打嘴巴

专栏：外论摘要

    美国政府领导人自打嘴巴
    编者按：美国“纽约邮报”在10月16日发表了一篇以“华盛顿的战斗”为题的社论。这篇社论列举了一系列事实，指出艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯最近就台湾海峡问题发表的言论充满了“矛盾和混乱”。
      为什么美国政府领导人的言论会这样出尔反尔、颠三倒四呢？“纽约邮报”并没有答复这个问题。但是，从美国其它一些报刊上，人们不难找到原因何在。这就是：中国人民要解放台、澎、金、马的坚定决心，打乱了美国政府在台湾海峡地区放火同时又硬要中国人民“停火”的阴谋；美国的侵略政策遭到了国内外的激烈反对。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之所以会语无伦次，正是反映了美国政府推行侵略政策遇到困难而又不愿放弃侵略政策的尴尬处境。
    为了让大家看看艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流当前的狼狈相和无耻面目，我们把“纽约邮报”的社论摘要发表于后。

    这里是关于这个国家（美国）首都最近出现的矛盾、混乱……。
    在金门问题上杜勒斯驳斥杜勒斯
    三个星期以前（9月25日），杜勒斯对世界说，金门对美国在远东的政治地位同柏林在欧洲（指西方）一样重要。两个星期以前9月30日，他宣布，蒋介石把这么多的军队驻在金门是愚蠢的，因为它对福摩萨（指台湾）的防御并不是十分重要的，他说，他将赞成减少军队，如果共产党人停止炮轰的话。在14日，他说，美国根本没有关于减少军队问题的政策。这完全是一个军事问题和蒋介石的私人事情。
    在金门问题上艾森豪威尔驳斥杜勒斯
    艾森豪威尔总统15日表示，他将欢迎国民党（指蒋介石集团）自愿减少金门的军队。
    在（国内）政治上艾森豪威尔驳斥杜勒斯
    杜勒斯14日在他的记者招待会上说，他不反对在竞选运动中辩论外交政策的基本原则，但是他认为辩论目前的局势并不是一件好事情。
    艾森豪威尔15日在他的记者招待会上说，对全面的总的政策不应该展开任何辩论，但是他预料批评政府的人不会不攻击根据总的外交政策决定所采取的某些行动。
    在（国内）政治上杜勒斯驳斥杜勒斯
    杜勒斯14日批评副总统尼克松的指责，尼克松说：“艾奇逊—杜鲁门的外交政策造成了战争，艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的政策造成了和平。”他说，这种话不符合他所认为的“平心静气”的辩论。
    杜勒斯15日发表一个更正，解释说，他实在一点也没有批评尼克松。杜勒斯说，尼克松是回答民主党外交谘询委员会12日发表的“外交政策挑战的，副总统的雄辩显然是有道理的”。
