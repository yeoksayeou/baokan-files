Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th. The Ministry of Communications convened a National Waterborne Steel Transport Leap Forward Conference in Wuhan from the 6th to the 12th. The conference decided to launch a vigorous mass movement, further develop a massive technical revolution and communist large-scale collaboration, tap transportation potential, multiply water transport capacity, and ensure the completion of steel production material and other important material transportation tasks.

The conference believes that the greatest potential for water transport lies in ports. The main method for tapping port potential is to launch a vigorous mass movement, implement the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation, and adopt both manual labor and mechanization simultaneously. Large and medium-sized ports should learn from the experience of Changzhou City's "ants moving Mount Tai," and under the leadership of the local Party committee, organize workers' families, citizens, students, government cadres, and others to complete loading and unloading work through shock efforts. Ports with the conditions should learn from the experience of the Guanting Township Commune Transportation Team in Changge County, Henan Province, and organize commune members to form loading and unloading combat organizations. In terms of loading and unloading machinery, a large number of simple and effective small machines should be promoted. All available indigenous and foreign tools should be used, and ropes and carrying poles should be adopted when necessary. In addition, the organization of labor and the scheduling of ports should be strengthened to ensure that goods are loaded and unloaded upon arrival, quickly loaded and unloaded, materials are not accumulated, and ports are not congested.

The carrying potential of ships, especially wooden sailing ships, is also very large. There are many typical examples of tapping the potential of ships. For example, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, by fully exploiting horsepower efficiency and finding ways to increase the carrying capacity of ships, tapped 47,000 horsepower, accounting for 34.5% of the original ship horsepower, and 74,000 tons of deadweight, accounting for 12.4% of the original ship tonnage. Along the coast, cargo ships tow barges and one ship is used for two purposes, increasing transport capacity by 26%. Hubei Province promoted the method of rudderless pushing and iron-wood mixed formation, which solved the difficulties of wooden boats being unable to push and barges being insufficient, increasing the load by half to one time. The Jiang'an Wheel of the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau proposed "no factory visits for five years, old ships become new ships," and adopted the method of running satellite factories and carrying out self-repair and maintenance activities. In recent months, the amount of repair work they have done themselves is equivalent to a medium repair project for a ship; at the same time, they are also responsible for the parts manufacturing tasks of four ships. The conference believes that, on the premise of ensuring safety and adapting to local conditions, it is necessary to promote advanced experience and vigorously tap the potential of ships.

The country's wooden sailing ships are a huge transportation force, and their tonnage is many times that of the country's motorized ships, but this transportation force has not been fully utilized. They often sail for one day and stay in port for many days. The conference pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the technical transformation and organizational work of wooden sailing ships. As long as slight improvements are made in each link, the carrying capacity of wooden sailing ships can be doubled. For example, the Wuhan Wooden Sailing Ship Management Station strengthened cooperation with cargo owners, loading and unloading, and dock departments, which shortened the port stay time of wooden sailing ships from the past ten to fifteen days to three to five days.

The conference pointed out that tapping transportation potential must launch a mass movement, carry out technical innovation in a big way, and engage in large-scale collaboration. The port is a hub connecting ships, trains, automobiles, and material consignment departments, and is a collection point of contradictions. The quality of collaboration is very important to the entire water transport work. The cooperative relationship between ports, between ports and ships, railways, and material consignment departments must be handled well.

In terms of technical innovation, the prominent shortcomings currently existing are: only paying attention to invention and creation, not paying attention to exchange and promotion, often being vigorous before the event and deserted afterwards, so many high-yield "satellites" cannot be developed into "large-scale high yield," and many technical improvements cannot be further improved. The conference pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely overcome this bureaucratic attitude that undermines the enthusiasm of the masses, and achieve that technical innovation blossoms and bears fruit, and continuously pushes technical innovation wave after wave to a higher stage around improving transportation capacity.

The conference also made arrangements for next year's water transport work plan, believing that it is necessary to seize the basic construction of ports and ships, so that newly built ships, warehouses, docks, cargo yards, and mechanical equipment are put into production as early as possible.

    让江河湖海为钢帅开路
    航运部门力争运量加番当好先行官
    据新华社武汉14日电　交通部6日到12日在武汉召开全国水上钢铁运输跃进会议，决定大搞群众运动，进一步开展轰轰烈烈的技术革命和共产主义大协作，挖掘运输潜力，使水上运输能力成倍地增长，保证钢铁生产物资和其他重要物资运输任务的完成。
    会议认为当前水上运输潜力最大的是港口。挖掘港口潜力，目前的主要方法在于大搞群众运动，执行全党全民办交通的方针，采取人力和机械化同时并举。大中港口要学习常州市“蚂蚁搬泰山”的经验，在当地党委领导下，组织职工家属、市民、学生、机关干部等突击完成装卸工作；有条件的港口，要学习河南长葛县官亭乡公社运输队的经验，组织公社社员成立装卸战斗组织。在装卸机械方面，要大量推广各种简单有效的小型机械，凡能到手的土工具、洋工具都要使用，必要时扁担绳子也要采用。另外，还要加强劳动力的组织、港口的调度等工作，做到货物随到随装卸，快装快卸，物资不积压，港口不堵塞。
    船舶的载运潜力，特别是木帆船的载运潜力也很大。挖掘船舶方面潜力的典型事例很多，如长江航运局和上海海运局通过充分发挥马力效能及多方设法提高船舶载重能力，就挖掘出四万七千马力，为原有船只马力的34.5％，载重量七万四千吨，为原有船只吨位的12.4％。沿海实行货轮拖驳、一船两用，增加运力26％。湖北省推行无舵顶推和铁木混合编队的方法，解决了木船不能顶推和驳船不足的困难，载量提高半倍到一倍。长江航运局江安轮倡议“五年不进厂、老船变新船”，采取大办卫星厂，开展自修和保养活动，几个月来自己进行修理的工作量相当于一个船舶的中修工程；同时他们还负责四艘船舶的配件制造任务。会议认为，在保证安全和因地制宜的条件下，必须推广先进经验，大力挖掘船舶的潜力。
    全国的木帆船是一支巨大的运输力量，它的吨位等于全国机动船的许多倍，但这支运输力量远没有得到充分利用。它们往往航行一天，在港口要停留许多天。会议指出，必须大力加强木帆船的技术改造和组织工作，只要在各个环节稍加改进，木帆船的运力就可以加番。如武汉木帆船管理站加强同货主、装卸和码头等部门的协作，就使木帆船的停港时间由过去的十至十五天，缩短到三至五天。
    会议指出，挖掘运输潜力必须开展群众运动，大闹技术革新，大搞协作。港口是连接轮船、火车、汽车和物资托运部门的枢纽，是矛盾的集合点，协作得好坏对整个水运工作关系很大，各港口之间，港口与船舶、铁路以及物资托运部门之间的协作关系，必须搞好。
    在技术革新方面，目前存在的突出缺点是：只重视发明创造，不注意交流推广，往往事前轰轰烈烈，事后冷冷清清，很多高产“卫星”因此不能发展为“大面积丰产”，很多技术改进得不到进一步提高。会议指出，必须坚决克服这种挫伤群众积极性的官僚主义态度，做到技术革新开一个花结一个果，围绕着提高运输能力不断把技术革新一浪逐一浪地推向更高阶段。
    会议对明年的水运工作计划也作了安排，认为必须抓紧港口和船舶的基本建设，使新建船舶、仓库、码头、货场和机械设备尽量提前投入生产。
