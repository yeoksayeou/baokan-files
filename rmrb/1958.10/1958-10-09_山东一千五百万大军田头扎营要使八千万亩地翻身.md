Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 8th (Reporter Hu Lei) reports: Shandong has recently mobilized over 15 million people, launching a massive land-turning campaign. The people of this province are calling this intense and heated autumn harvest and planting movement the "Huaihai Campaign," determined to bring hundreds of billions of catties of grain home in a short period and give 80 million mu of land a complete transformation, laying a solid foundation for achieving a per-mu yield of 1,000 catties of wheat next year.

The reporter recently traveled through 700 li of plains in western Shandong and witnessed a vast scene of people and vehicles everywhere, making the autumn harvest a magnificent spectacle. The tents in the fields along the way were virtually strung together like streets, stretching for dozens of miles, seemingly without end. Inside those tents were women's dormitories, men's dormitories, field canteens, command posts, department stores, food stores, health clinics, cultural stations, bookstores, nurseries, and field red-and-expert universities. All departments and personnel serving the autumn harvest and planting have moved to the fields. During rest periods, the fields have become the most active places for political work. Students from the red-and-expert universities are attending classes in the fields, discussing the science and technology of wheat planting. Readers and propagandists are inserting themselves among the people to read newspapers. Broadcasters are broadcasting heroic and model deeds and publishing battle reports everywhere. Militiamen are practicing martial arts. Young people are singing and writing big-character posters. All these scenes show that it is this huge and rigorous labor collective and in-depth political and ideological work that has inspired people's vigorous enthusiasm.

This surging land-turning movement has spread throughout the province, demonstrating the tremendous superiority of the people's communes. Now, the entire province of Shandong has realized communization, and various places have formed countless field corps, camping in the fields, staying on the worksite day and night, and working intensely. Party committee secretaries have all gone to the fields. The vast majority of cadres have generally moved to the worksite to eat, live, and work with the masses. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has proposed that all wheat be sown before the Frost's Descent solar term. As of the 7th, the province had turned over 36 million mu of land and rush-planted over 10 million mu of wheat. The wheat fields in various places have generally been deeply ploughed to a depth of 1.5 to 2 feet, and some have been deeply ploughed to a depth of 5 feet or even 1 zhang.

Because the masses have been deeply mobilized, heroes have emerged everywhere, unafraid of any difficulties. Shou Zhang County has a "Ten Golden Sisters" team that proposed the slogan: "If the Wheat Marshal does not ascend his command post, if the satellite does not go into space, we will never go home." They are determined to work in the fields throughout the winter and spring to strive for miracles next year. Auntie Zhen from Shahe Township transports 60,000 catties of fertilizer to the fields in one day, and people call her the "Fertilizer Transport King." This county also has a 70-year-old grandmother who competed with a young man in transporting fertilizer. The two competed for a whole day, without a winner. Farmers wrote big-character posters praising this as the "Iron Grandma vs. Sun Wukong." Lin Yi Prefecture is currently experiencing drought, and the people's communes there have mobilized 3 million people, launching a massive drought-resistant wheat planting campaign. Huan Tai County has 60,000 people launching a fierce attack on the drought, planting more than 10,000 mu of wheat in a few days.

The operations of the various field corps have reached a high degree of organization. They have adopted a series of assembly line operations, such as land turning, fumigation, fertilization, irrigation, ridge construction, and sowing. Thousands of acres of land are completed sequentially, one process after another, according to uniform farming specifications. Farmers call this a clean and efficient "mopping-up operation." In order to ensure the quality of wheat planting and overcome backward phenomena, many regions have conducted special free airing of views and debates to unify the thinking of the entire party and people on planting wheat well. Shou Zhang County raised a series of questions to the masses, such as how much fertilizer to apply, how much seed to use, how deep to plough, how dense to plant, and how many catties to harvest, and launched a mass debate to overcome right-leaning conservative ideas. This enabled all 120,000 mu of early-stage land to be deeply ploughed to three feet, and the satellite fields to be deeply ploughed to five feet to one zhang. They were all built into small ridge fields, and the amount of fertilizer applied averaged 300,000 to 500,000 catties per mu, and the "satellite" fields reached more than 1 million catties. In order to ensure specifications and quality, He Ze Prefecture launched a mass "eight checks and five comparisons" movement, unfolded large-scale free airing of views and debates in the checks and comparisons, promptly promoted good experiences, and corrected phenomena that did not meet specifications and quality. The Red Flag People's Commune in Lai Yang Prefecture recently held a meeting of cadres above the battalion level to examine and criticize the slow progress of land turning and wheat planting in the previous stage. Everyone proposed to turn defeat into victory and maintain the red flag. After a night of fierce battle, they turned over 950 mu of land and harvested 810 mu of corn.

In this "Huaihai Campaign," the millions of iron and wood workers in the commune-run factories have also been mobilized to fight for a thousand-catty-per-mu wheat yield province. Lin Yi Prefecture decided to build 10,000 li of simple railways for wooden trains to solve transportation difficulties, and workers have already built several thousand li. Huang Xian mobilized 4,000 technicians and worked hard for seven days and nights to produce 10,000 sets of rope-drawn deep ploughs, basically realizing the rope-traction of cultivated land. The masses were greatly encouraged by this. They praised: "The capstan is powerful, stronger than four strong oxen. Deep ploughing one and a half feet, cultivates two mu a day, better than a tractor, angers old oxen." (Attached picture)

    山东一千五百万大军田头扎营要使八千万亩地翻身
    新华社济南8日电　记者胡雷报道：山东最近出动了一千五百多万人，掀起了轰轰烈烈的大翻地运动。这个省的人民称这次紧张热烈的秋收秋种运动为“淮海大战”，他们决心要在短期内把数百亿斤粮食颗粒还家，把八千万亩土地来个大翻身，为明年实现小麦千斤省打下良好的根基。
    记者最近乘车穿过了鲁西七百里平原，只见那里遍野人山人海，车水马龙，三秋的景象蔚为壮观。沿途田野里的帐棚简直搭成了一条条的街道，绵延几十里，极目无边。在那些帐棚里，有女寝室，有男宿舍，有田间食堂，有指挥所、百货部、食品部、卫生所、文化站、书店、托儿组，以及田间红专大学。所有为秋收秋种服务的部门和人员，都搬到了田间。在休息的时候，田间成了政治工作最活跃的地方。红专大学的学生们，在田头上课，讨论种麦的科学技术。读报员、宣传员插到人们中间读报。广播员到处广播英雄模范事迹，发表战报。民兵们在练武。青年们有的在唱歌，有的在写大字报。所有这些景象表明，正是这种巨大而严密的劳动集体和深入的政治思想工作，鼓起了人们蓬蓬勃勃的干劲。
    这种万马奔腾的大翻地运动已经遍及全省，人民公社显示出了巨大优越性。现在山东全省已经实现了公社化，各地组成了无数支野战兵团，在田间安营扎寨，昼夜不离工地，紧张地进行劳动。党委书记都到了田间。广大干部普遍搬到工地上和群众同吃同住同劳动。中共山东省委提出要在霜降以前全部种好小麦。到7日为止，全省已翻地三千六百多万亩，抢种了小麦一千多万亩。各地的麦田普遍深翻了一尺半到二尺深，有的深翻达到五尺甚至一丈。
    由于群众深入发动起来，各地英雄辈出，他们不惧任何困难。寿张县有一个“金刚十姊妹”队，她们提出口号：“小麦元帅不升帐，卫星不上天，决不回家。”她们决心要在田间劳动一冬春，争取明年创奇迹。沙河乡甄大娘一天往地里运肥六万斤，人们称她是“运肥大王”。这个县还有一个七十岁的老奶奶，同一个青年人比运肥，两人整整比赛了一天，不分胜负，农民写大字报表扬说，这是“铁奶奶大战孙悟空”。临沂专区目前正呈现旱象，那里的人民公社动员了三百万人，掀起了轰轰烈烈的抗旱种麦运动。桓台县有六万人向干旱发起了猛攻，几天之内就种小麦一万多亩。
    各个野战兵团的作战，达到了高度的组织性，他们采取翻地、熏肥、施肥、灌水、打畦田、播种等一系列的流水作业法，几千亩几万亩土地，一道工序接一道工序，按照统一的耕作规格，顺序完成，农民叫这是干净利落的“扫荡战”。为了保证种麦的规格质量和克服落后现象，许多地区为此进行了专题鸣放辩论，统一了全党全民种好小麦的思想。寿张县向群众提出施多少肥，用多少种，翻多么深，种多么密，收多少斤等一系列问题，展开全民大辩论，战胜了右倾保守思想，使十二万亩早茬地全部深翻三尺，卫星田深翻五尺到一丈，并且都打成了小畦田，施肥量平均每亩达到三十万斤到五十万斤，“卫星”田达到一百万斤以上。菏泽专区为了确保规格质量，发起全民性八查五比运动，在查比中展开了大鸣大放大辩论，及时推广了好经验，纠正了不合规格质量的现象。莱阳专区的红旗人民公社，最近召开了营以上的干部会，检查批判了前段翻地种麦迟缓的现象，大家提出要败中取胜，保住红旗，会后经过一个通宵的激战，就翻地九百五十亩，收割玉米八百一十亩。
    在这个“淮海大战”中，人民公社的社办工厂里，几百万铁木工人也都动员起来，为小麦千斤省而战斗。临沂专区决定修建行驶木制火车的简易路轨一万华里，解决运输困难，现在工人们已经修好几千华里。黄县动员了四千名技术工人，奋战七昼夜，制成了一万部绳索牵引深耕犁，基本实现了耕地绳索牵引化。群众对此大受鼓舞，他们赞扬道：“绞关机，力气大，四头壮牛不如它，深耕一尺五，一天耕二亩，赛过拖拉机，气死老黄牛”。（附图片）
