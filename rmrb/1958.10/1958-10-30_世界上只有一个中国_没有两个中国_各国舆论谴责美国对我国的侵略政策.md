Reported by our newspaper: The United States is stepping up its efforts to promote the conspiracy of creating "two Chinas," which has aroused condemnation from public opinion in various countries. Newspapers and periodicals in many countries unanimously pointed out that there has only been one China since ancient times, and the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is bound to fail.

The Albanian "Warrior Daily" stated that the Dulles-Chiang talks fully demonstrated the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas," without concealing its aggressive policy against China. The attempt of US imperialism to oppose everything about China has been fully exposed to the people of the world, and it will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

The French "Liberation Newspaper" said that the Dulles-Chiang talks did not solve any problems. Dulles's argument that "two Chinas exist in fact" is a means for the United States to occupy Taiwan. However, China will never agree.

The "Geneva Forum" published an editorial on the 27th, signed by Jean-Jacques Gautier, commenting on the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks. It said that on the surface, it was not worth Dulles's trip to Taiwan, but Dulles's trip was engaged in the conspiracy of "two Chinas." "When Dulles also said that his talks involved more fundamental issues, one can imagine that he was hinting at the 'two Chinas' issue."

The editorial also pointed out that the Chinese government has always opposed the absurd claim of "two Chinas."

The editorial analyzed the situation of discord between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, saying that on the one hand, "what Chiang Kai-shek cares about is to get assurances that he will not be abandoned by his American friends"; on the other hand, Dulles's "main task is to prevent the Kuomintang leader from creating new troubles for the Washington government." But Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek have one thing in common, that is, Chiang Kai-shek had to admit that he was powerless to "recover the mainland," and "the Americans have in fact accepted the existence of the Beijing government."

A Japanese radio station also admitted in a radio commentary that the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" would not succeed. The commentary pointed out that the US plan "is not tolerable to the communist China that insists that 'there is only one China and the Taiwan issue is an internal affair'." At the same time, the commentary said that this plan of the United States would "shake the foundation" of the Chiang Kai-shek group, "and it will become a Taiwanese government in name, or create a trusteeship imagined by some Western countries. Therefore, it is only natural that the Kuomintang expresses strong opposition to this." The radio commentary believes that Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwanese compatriots is a "direct response to the Dulles-Chiang Joint Communiqué."

### 世界上只有一个中国　没有两个中国  各国舆论谴责美国对我国的侵略政策

    世界上只有一个中国　没有两个中国
    各国舆论谴责美国对我国的侵略政策
    本报综合报道　美国加紧推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，引起了各国舆论的谴责。很多国家的报刊一致指出，中国自古只有一个，美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋肯定是要失败的。
    阿尔巴尼亚“战士报”说，杜蒋会谈完全表明了美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，毫不隐饰它反对中国的侵略政策。美帝国主义反对中国的一切企图已完全暴露在全世界人们面前，它定将遭到可耻的失败。
    法国“解放报”说，杜蒋会谈什么问题也没有解决。杜勒斯所谓“事实上存在着两个中国”的论点，是美国霸占台湾的一种手段。可是，中国决不会同意。
    “日内瓦论坛报”27日发表了让—雅克·乔艾署名的评论杜勒斯和蒋介石会谈的一篇社论。说，从表面上看来，杜勒斯不值得跑台湾一趟，但是杜勒斯此行却在搞“两个中国”的阴谋。“当杜勒斯还说他的会谈牵涉到更为根本性的问题时，人们可以设想，他是在暗示‘两个中国’的问题”。
    社论还指出，中国政府从来反对“两个中国”的荒谬主涨。
    社论分析了美蒋之间同床异梦的情况说，一方面，“蒋介石所关心的，就是要得到保证，不会被他的美国朋友所唾弃”；另一方面，杜勒斯“主要是要这位国民党领袖不再为华盛顿政府制造新的麻烦”。但杜勒斯和蒋介石有一点是共同的，那就是，蒋介石不得不承认无力“收复大陆”，“美国人事实上接受北京政府的存在”。
    日本广播电台在一篇广播评论也承认美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋是不会得逞的。评论指出，美国这个打算，“对于主张‘中国只有一个，台湾问题是内政问题’的共产党中国说来，不是它所能容忍的。”同时这篇评论说，美国这种打算，对蒋介石集团说来，它的“基础就会动摇，会名符其实地变成台湾政府，或者是造成西方部分国家所想像的托管。因此，国民党对此表示强烈反对也是理所当然的。”这篇广播评论认为，中国国防部长彭德怀再告台湾同胞书就是“对于杜蒋联合公报的直接答复”。
