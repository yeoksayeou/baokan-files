Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. Small coal kilns and mines are blossoming everywhere in Shaanxi. More than 1,200 small coal kilns and mines that have already been put into production throughout the province have produced more than 990,000 tons of raw coal by the beginning of October. More than 100 small coal kilns and mines are still under construction. It is estimated that the total coal production of small coal kilns and mines in the province this year will reach 2 million tons. Together with the coal production of the state-owned Tongchuan Coal Mine, the province's coal consumption this year can not only be basically self-sufficient, but also support Gansu Province with 200,000 tons of coking coal.

Shaanxi is rich in coal reserves, with coal resources in more than 70 counties. In the past, there was only one large Tongchuan Coal Mine and more than 70 small coal kilns and mines, and the province's coal consumption still needed to be transferred from outside. At the beginning of the year, Shaanxi Province decided to build small coal kilns and mines on a large scale everywhere. Now, not only has the Weinan area, which already has a coal industry base, seen new developments in small coal kilns and mines, but even the southern Shaanxi area, where coal resources were previously unclear, has built a large number of small coal kilns. Among them, more than 550 small coal kilns built in the Ankang area, which used to be short of coal, have now produced more than 260,000 tons of raw coal. Small coal kilns and mines in various places not only produce general industrial coal and civilian coal, but also Yan'an, Yulin, Shangluo and other areas with remote transportation are undertaking the task of supplying coking coal and coke for the local iron and steel industry for the first time.

Various places in Shaanxi use simple local methods to mine, with less investment and quick results. For example, the small mine built in Chengcheng County uses locally produced bricks instead of cement to build the shaft, and uses a hand-cranked winch as the power to transport stone slag. The average investment per ton of coal is only seven yuan. There are also some small coal kilns mined by agricultural cooperatives in various places, which are generally mined in shallow coal seams or coal seam outcrops. This year, Tongchuan Coal Mine has also newly built four small mine shafts outside the state plan. The technical force and designers for mining were drawn from large mines.

    陕西煤炭今年自给
    据新华社西安电　陕西各地新建小煤窑、小煤矿遍地开花。全省现已经投入生产的一千二百多个小煤窑和小煤矿，到十月初为止已经生产了九十九万多吨原煤。还有一百多个小煤窑、矿正在继续建设。预计今年全省小煤窑、矿产煤总量将达二百万吨。加上国营铜川煤矿的产煤量，今年全省用煤不但可以基本自给，还可以支援甘肃省二十万吨焦煤。
    陕西煤藏丰富，七十多个县都有煤炭资源。过去，只有一个大型的铜川煤矿，和七十多个小煤窑、矿，本省用煤还需从外边调入。陕西省在年初就确定各地普遍大建小煤窑、矿。现在，不但在已有煤炭工业基础的渭北地带，小煤窑、矿有了新的发展，连过去煤炭资源不清的陕南地区，也新建了大批小煤窑。其中过去缺煤的安康地区建设的五百五十多个小煤窑，现已生产了二十六万多吨原煤。各地小煤窑、矿不仅生产一般工业用煤和民用煤，延安、榆林、商雒等交通较偏僻的地区，还第一次承担起供应本区钢铁工业焦煤和焦炭的任务。
    陕西各地用简易的土办法开矿，投资少，见效快。如澄城县建设的小矿，用当地生产的砖代替水泥砌开筒，用手摇绞车做运石碴的动力，平均每吨煤的投资只需七元。各地还有一些由农业社开采的小煤窑，一般都在浅煤层或煤层露头上开采。铜川煤矿今年在国家计划外，也新增建了四个小矿井。开矿的技术力量和设计人员都是从大矿抽出的。
