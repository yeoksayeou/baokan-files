    A New Variant of the Calculating Faction
    You Mowen
    Autumn harvest is over, and the bumper harvest and high yields are a settled matter. The original calculating faction members, staring blankly at the mountains of grain and cotton, have nothing to say. The more honest ones have already admitted defeat and transformed into promoters; but there are still some who think they are smarter than others, and they want to calculate another account. They say: "High-yield fields? Requiring hundreds of labor days and tens of thousands of fertilizer applications, the grain produced is a lot, but the capital invested is also considerable. This is a losing proposition and not worthwhile. Only making a huge profit with little investment counts as real skill!" Let's temporarily call these people "loss theorists." This is a new variant of the old calculating faction in the context of a bumper harvest.
    The new account proposed by the "loss theorists" will still lead to their defeat.
    If we calculate the costs, it's not just the labor and fertilizer mentioned by the "loss theorists," but also seeds, pesticides, and machinery. Because the achievement of high yields, in addition to deep plowing, watering, and fertilization, also involves close planting, pest control, and the use of improved tools, and so on. Then, calculated in this way, isn't the "loss" even greater?
    However, that's not the case. First, we have obtained an unprecedented amount of grain and cotton to ensure adequate food and clothing; second, we have achieved a victory of man over nature: taming rivers, eliminating droughts and floods, understanding that "man can conquer nature," breaking superstitions, and establishing a communist style; third, we have obtained a complete set of new cultivation techniques and field management experience, which is a great creation without precedent and cannot be measured by price; fourth, we have uncovered new secrets of soil and seeds, and discovered new theories in agricultural science, providing a solid foundation for ensuring greater yields from the land. Compared with the labor and costs spent, this is not only "making a huge profit with little investment," but the benefits are endless and cannot be counted by anyone. The "loss theorists" think that we are disregarding profit and not caring about costs. Wrong, we pay great attention to significant gains and know how to use steel on the blade. We simply despise the small gains and small profits that the "loss theorists" are constantly thinking about. As for further improving technology, increasing labor efficiency, and reducing costs, these are naturally problems that need to be continuously addressed; but they have nothing to do with "loss."
    However, this account is not finished yet, and we must ask the "loss theorists" two questions: First, do you understand the peasant saying: "An ox that doesn't plow the field will still get old." The power of people is inexhaustible and increases with use. Don't you see strongmen, who lift more and more weight, and their strength also increases more and more; don't you see pale scholars who become more and more incapable of tying chickens and weak and unable to withstand the wind the less they exert themselves. Then, how can human labor spent on production be called a "loss"? Second, do you understand that fertilizer is used to fertilize the fields. Besides fertilizing the fields, what else can manure be used for? As for how much fertilizer to apply? Naturally, it is best to use an appropriate amount. How can it be considered uneconomical to use more fertilizer to obtain more grain? I wonder what the "loss theorists" mean by "making a huge profit with little investment"? Could it be not spending labor or applying fertilizer and letting God bestow high yields?
    Just as people have obtained the first great bumper harvest and are vigorously preparing to achieve an even greater harvest next year, the "loss theorists" are making cold remarks, with the aim of demoralizing people and undermining the military spirit. This is still the true color of the retreating faction and must be exposed.

    算账派的新变种
    游默文
    秋收过了，丰收和高产成了定论，原来的算账派们，看着堆积如山的粮、棉发呆，无话可说了。诚实些的已经服输，转化成了促进派；但还有些自以为比别人聪明的，却又要算另一笔账。他们说：“高产田么？费工几百，施肥数万，打的粮多，下的老本也不少，这是赔本买卖，不合算。能一本万利才算真本事咧！”暂且把这种人命名为赔本论者吧，这是在丰收的情况下旧算账派的新变种。
    “赔本论”者提出的这笔新账，算起来他们还是要输的。
    倘计工本，其实不只是“赔本论”者所举出的人工和肥料，应该还有种子，农药和器械。因为高产的取得，除了深耕、浇水、施肥以外，也还有密植、除虫以及使用改良的工具等等。那末，如此算来，“本”赔得不是更多了吗？
    然而不然。第一，我们取得了从来没有过的这样多的保证丰衣足食的粮棉；第二，我们取得了人对自然的胜利：驯服了江河，旱、涝，懂得了“人定胜天”，破除了迷信思想，树立了共产主义风格；第三，我们取得了成套的新的耕作技术和田间管理的经验，这是前无古人的伟大创造，是无法以价计量的；第四，我们揭破了土壤和种子的新的秘密，发现了农业科学方面的新理论，为保证土地更大产量提供了坚实的基础。这些同所花工本比较起来，不仅是“一本万利”，而是其利无穷，谁都没法数。“赔本论”者以为我们是不计功利不惜工本的。错了，我们是非常注意大功大利而又知道把钢用在刀刃上的。只是鄙视“赔本论”者所念念不忘的那小功小利而已。至于更加提高技术，发挥人工效率降低成本，自然是要不断注意解决的问题；但同“赔本”无关。
    然而这账还没算完，还要反问“赔本论”者两个问题：第一，你们懂不懂农民一句俗语：“牛不耕地也要老”。人的力量是用之不尽的。而且越用越多。君不见大力士，他举的重量越来越多，他的力气增长的也越来越多；君不见白面书生越不出力，就越发地手不能缚鸡，弱不能禁风。那末，人力花在生产上又怎能叫作“赔本”呢？第二，你们懂不懂肥料就是用来肥田的。除了肥田，大粪又能作什么用？至于肥应用多少？自然以适宜为妙。多施肥料来多得粮食，怎能叫不合算呢？不知“赔本论”者所说的“一本万利”究竟是什么？难道是不费人工也不施肥料而让老天爷赐予高产吗？
    正当人们获得了第一个大丰收，精神奋发地准备去取得明年更大的丰收的时候，“赔本论”者冷言冷语，目的无非是要泄人们的气，瓦解军心。这仍是促退派的本色，不能不予以揭穿。
