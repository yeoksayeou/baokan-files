A Day in the Commune
By Our Correspondent

    A Battle in the Mountains
    At dawn on September 26th, before the sun had risen over the mountains, the sounds of gongs, whistles, and horns echoed through the dozens of villages in Shimen Township, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province. Male and female commune members, formed into teams, hurried to their respective production posts. The People's Commune's day of battle began anew.
    This is the Shimen Cultivation Area of the Xindeng People's Commune, and also the main supplier of charcoal fuel for the commune's indigenous iron smelting furnaces.
    From early morning, everywhere was bustling with forest felling teams, kiln firing teams, and charcoal transportation teams. The mountain tops, hillsides, valleys, and roadside were all filled with the smoke from the charcoal kilns...
    The male and female commune members of the Third Platoon of the Fourth Company were building a new charcoal kiln, aiming to produce over two thousand catties of charcoal in a single firing, more than double the previous output. The brick and tile factory belonging to the cultivation area, located next to the Fourth Company, also converted a brick and tile kiln into a charcoal kiln, planning to produce over ten thousand catties of charcoal per firing to meet the needs of iron and steel production.
    In the Second Company, Company Commander Jin Dechao led more than twenty women and several elderly commune members from the Second Platoon to Kaojianwu, six miles from home. They were determined to build charcoal kilns all over this deep mountain area. The nursery and canteen were also moved up the mountain. Jin Dechao's wife, Luo Zhuxiang, used to be overwhelmed by her five children, unable to leave home to work. Now, with the children and household chores no longer her concern, she happily followed her husband up the mountain every day, focusing wholeheartedly on production. That day, she helped the elderly commune member Cheng Laowu build a charcoal kiln, already quite skilled in the work.
    On this day, the members of the transportation team were also achieving new successes. The First Platoon of the Fourth Company set up a bamboo rope transportation line, several dozen feet long, to transport large amounts of firewood from the high mountains to the roadside below, greatly increasing efficiency compared to the past. The teams transporting charcoal to Chengyang Town, forty miles away, launched a competition to deliver more and faster. Some commune members were now able to transport over a thousand catties of charcoal each time, double what they had done before.
    A small blast furnace located in the Fifth Company was fired up for the first time that day, the first furnace in the entire cultivation area to go into production. Various companies supported the iron smelting furnace, some sending charcoal and ore, others crushing charcoal and ore. The director of the Xindeng Third Steel Factory also led several workers to help with the iron smelting, the vast majority of whom were originally farmers living in this cultivation area. They not only smelted iron, but also taught techniques. When the first molten iron flowed out at three o'clock in the afternoon, a wall of people formed around the furnace. An old woman in her eighties even brought her child to visit, and everywhere was filled with laughter.
    At night, the Red and Expert School held classes, where young men and women studied diligently. Lights were scattered along the mountainside and on the mountain, and the roar of the small blast furnace's motor reverberated through the valley, as people worked tirelessly.

    Mid-Autumn Night Poetry Gathering
    On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moonlight was bright and clear, and the autumn breeze brought a chill to the air. After a day of intense labor, the members of the Leap Forward People's Commune in the southwestern suburbs of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, spontaneously gathered to eat mooncakes and fruit, and admire the moon. Many commune members who loved poetry composed and recited poems, holding a poetry gathering. One work hailed as excellent was "Singing of the Great Harvest in Jinci" written in collaboration by commune members Wu Rongkui and Li Quanzhong:
    Mining up Jilong Mountain, boundless fields of harvest in sight;
    Patches of red, patches of yellow, red and yellow reflecting beautifully.
    Sorghum heads like umbrellas, corn cobs a foot and a half long;
    Millet heads are large and full of grains, rice paddies rolling like the south of the Yangtze River.
    Last year, the yield was eight hundred catties per mu, this year a leap forward to three thousand three;
    The potential of the land is incalculable, all depends on how we utilize it.
    This year's leap forward has begun, next year we will fight a main battle;
    Let us make a promise of a bumper harvest now, and revel again at this time next year.

    In recent days, the iron smelting army, toiling hard in the Mafangou ravine west of the village, had built over a hundred iron smelting furnaces, which had been producing iron one after another. On this Mid-Autumn Festival, the entire workforce did not rest, and built another batch of new furnaces. Zhang Yinniu, an activist in socialist construction and a member of the Communist Youth League, and the commune members, while working hard, composed a clapper talk called "Great Battle in Mafangou":
    Mafang Mountain, Mafang Ravine, stones piled upon stones,
    No grass grows, no grain is harvested, cursed since ancient times as "cattle-killing."
    A mighty army marches heroically, the ravine yields and the mountain bows;
    Molten iron flows throughout the mountains and ravines, turning the poor ravine into a rich ravine.

    In another group, mostly young men and women, everyone ate, drank, talked, and sang, very happily. Guo Zhi, an old farmer who had suffered hunger and cold in the old society, was moved by the scene and recalled the past. He said:
    Others think of their parents during the festival, I think of the bitter times of the past:
    Unable to eat three meals a day, unable to wear cotton clothes in the twelfth lunar month.
    The landlord's family eats mooncakes, even ghosts get a share, but the farmhands don't get a crumb.
    Young people don't know the suffering of the past, they are catching up with the happy times;
    Where does this happiness come from? Never forget the Communist Party.
    Old Guo's words left the young people speechless, and one by one they picked up their tools and went to work.

    Junior High School Entrance Examination
    On September 25th, the newly established junior high school of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, held an entrance examination for new students. More than a hundred primary school graduates from major brigades across the commune participated in the entrance examination. These children are fortunate, as they will be able to continue their education all the way to university without leaving the commune, because the commune has already made plans to open a high school and a university.
    The first language test for the new students was an essay on "The People's Commune is Good." To write this essay well, it was not enough for the children to rely solely on textbook knowledge, because the term "People's Commune" did not yet exist in primary school textbooks. However, in the month or so since the establishment of the commune, the children's experiences had been profound. Wang Zuchun, a fourteen-year-old girl, wrote: "As soon as the commune was established, it bought tractors, built a hydroelectric power station, and established a Happiness Home. The teams are all working hard, striving to move forward, and contributing ideas to increase production."

    To Increase Production Next Year
    At five o'clock on the morning of the Mid-Autumn Festival, before the signal to go to work in the fields had sounded in the Beiyuan People's Commune of Licheng County, Shandong Province, vehicles transporting manure to the wheat fields were already shuttling back and forth. Many fertilizer-burning stoves in the fields had already sent up thick white smoke, making the fresh morning air foggy. The army of land turners, covering the fields, sang as they worked: Work, work, guarantee that each mu of wheat will yield twenty thousand catties. Not resting during the Mid-Autumn Festival, for the sake of increasing production next year. On this day, they deep-plowed two hundred mu of wheat fields, to a depth of one and a half feet.
    More than a thousand commune members building furnaces on the iron and steel front, after fighting hard for three days and nights, were still full of energy and soaring spirits. Amidst the slogans "Fear no hardship, fear no fatigue, guarantee the production of fifty tons of iron, and present it as a gift to National Day," they basically completed the construction of thirty-five indigenous blast furnaces and ten thousand crucibles by evening.

    An Extraordinary Day
    On my way to the fertilizer factory of the Dongfeng Commune in Pixian County, I met technician Du Shikang and lab technician Liu Zhongyu and two others.
    They told me that the factory had a great piece of good news today, and that they were on their way to report it to the commune party committee.
    Du Shikang unfolded a large red report of victory, revealing that the earthen method of cement manufacture he had been working on for a week with eight trials had finally been successfully tested that morning. He opened a packet of gray cement for me to see, which looked just like machine-made cement. He happily said: "The raw materials are everywhere, and in the future we can manufacture it in large quantities, making it convenient for the commune to build new residential areas."

    Happy People in the Happiness Home
    On September 27th, we visited the Happiness Home of the Fourth Team, She'er Village, Xianfeng People's Commune, Anguo County, Hebei Province. The walls inside the courtyard were white, the ground was swept clean, and a row of sixteen main rooms were all fitted with bright, clean glass windows. The courtyard was shaded by green trees and planted with many vegetables and flowers, like a small garden. The home housed fourteen elderly people in their seventies and eighties, with a cook and a attendant serving them. We entered the club room of the Happiness Home, where three happy elderly people were chatting after a meal, and greeted us warmly, inviting us to sit down. We asked them what kind of entertainment they had. Zhang Wenlin, an old man in his seventies, pointed to the erhu, horizontal flute hanging on the wall and the chess set on the table, and said with a smile: "The commune was afraid we would be bored, so they bought these things for us to play with, but we are all farmers, who knows how to play those things! When we get bored, we find some odd jobs to do, both to increase production and to exercise." When asked if they had any suggestions for the Happiness Home, Liu Zhanshan, an old man, said with a smile: "Comrades! We have entered paradise, what else could we ask for?" Then he said: "I lack sons and daughters, and I am without support. In the past, after working, I had to cook my own meals, and life was never sweet! Now that I'm in the Happiness Home, I'm relaxed! I'm being served three meals a day, and I feel younger and more energetic, thanks to Chairman Mao!" We strolled to the couples' dormitories and men's and women's dormitories for a visit, and each courtyard was clean, with thick bedding, landscape mirrors, teapots and teacups on the tables, and paintings and happy wishes pasted on the walls. Some old women were making their own cotton clothes, and some old people were reading newspapers. As we said goodbye to these happy old people, Zhang Youyu, an old man with difficulty moving, deaf ears and dim eyes, said with tears in his eyes and his hands clasped together: "Please write a letter to Chairman Mao for me, wishing him boundless happiness."

    公社的一日
    本报记者
    山中的战斗
    9月26日早晨，太阳还在山那边没有露出头来，浙江新登县石门乡的几十个村子里，就响起了锣声、哨子声或号声，男男女女的社员，成队地奔赴各自的生产岗位。人民公社一天的战斗生活又开始了。
    这里是新登人民公社的石门耕作区，也是全公社炼铁土炉燃料——木炭的主要供应地。
    从早晨开始，到处活跃着森林砍伐队、烧窑队和木炭运输队，在山顶上、山腰里、山谷中、山脚大路边，都弥漫着木炭窑散发出的浓烟……。
    第四连第三排的男女公社社员正在建造一只新的木炭窑，这只窑要创造一窑出二千多斤木炭的成绩，比过去提高产量一倍以上。设在第四连旁边的属于耕作区的砖瓦厂，也把一只砖瓦窑改成木炭窑，计划每窑产木炭一万多斤，来满足钢铁生产的需要。
    在第二连，连长金德潮带着第二排的二十多个妇女和几个老年社员来到离家六里的考涧坞，他们要在这个深山里把木炭窑建造得遍地都是。托儿所和食堂也跟着搬上山来了。金德潮的妻子罗祝香，过去由于五个孩子牵累，每天忙得不可开交，没有上山生产过。现在，孩子和家务事再也不用罗祝香操心了，每天，她高高兴兴地跟着丈夫一起上山，安安心心地搞生产。这天，她帮助老年社员程老五建造木炭窑，干起活来已经很熟练了。
    这一天，运输队的社员们也在创造新的成绩。四连一排设置了一根数十丈长的竹绳运输线，把高山上的大量木柴从空中运到山下的大路边来，效率比过去快许多倍。向离此四十里的城阳镇送木炭的队伍，展开了多送快送的竞赛，有的社员每人每次已能送炭一千多斤，比过去提高了一倍。
    设在第五连的一只小高炉，这一天第一次生火炼铁，这是全耕作区投入生产的第一只炉子。各个连队都支援这只炼铁炉，有的送炭、送矿石，有的敲炭、敲矿石。新登第三钢铁厂的厂长也率领几个工人来帮助炼铁，其中绝大部分是原先住在这个耕作区的农民。他们一边炼铁，一边教技术。下午三点多，第一炉铁水流出来的时候，炉子旁边筑起了人墙，八十多岁的老太太也带着孩子来参观了，到处是一片欢笑声。
    入夜，红专学校上课了，男女青年们在这里专心学习。山边和山上散布着灯火，小高炉的马达声响彻山谷，人们在加紧工作。
    中秋夜诗会
    中秋节夜晚，月色清明，阵阵秋风为人们带来了寒意。山西太原市郊西南方向跃进人民公社的社员们在紧张劳动以后，自动集合在一起吃月饼、水果，赏月。许多爱好诗歌的社员作诗、诵诗，举行诗会。被称为优秀作品的是社员武荣魁和李全忠合作的“唱唱晋祠大丰收”：
    挖矿上了鸡笼山，丰收庄田望无边；
    红一片，黄一片，红黄相映实好看。
    高粱穗子像雨伞，玉米棒子一尺半；
    谷子穗大籽粒满，稻田滚滚赛江南。
    去年亩产八百斤，今年跃进三千三；
    土地潜力难计算，全看咱们怎动弹。
    今年跃进开了头，明年打个主力战；
    现在许个丰产愿，明年此刻再狂欢。
    连日来，在村西马坊沟苦战的炼铁大军建成的一百多个炼铁炉，已经陆续出铁。中秋节这天全盘人马不休息，又建成了一批新炉。社会主义建设积极分子、共青团员张银牛和社员们一边苦干，一边编了一段“大战马坊沟”的快板：
    马坊山，马坊沟，石头上边垒石头，
    草不长，禾不收，自古咒它“气死牛”。
    千军万马雄赳赳，沟让路来山低头；
    满山遍沟铁水流，穷山沟变成富山沟。
    在另一个小组里，大部分是青年男女，大家吃吃喝喝，说说唱唱，十分高兴。在旧社会饱受饥寒之苦的老农民郭祉触景生情，回忆起往事。他说：
    别人过节想爹娘，我想过去苦时光：
    成天吃不饱三顿饭，腊月穿不上棉衣裳。
    地主家人吃月饼鬼有份，长工渣也不得尝。
    青年人不知过去苦，幸福时代正赶上；
    这样幸福从何降？多会也莫忘共产党。
    郭老汉一席话，说得青年们鸦雀无声，一个个拿起工具干活去了。
    初中新生入学考试
    9月25日，四川郫县东风人民公社新开办的初级中学举行新生入学考试。来自全社各大队的小学毕业生一百多人参加了入学考试。这些孩子是幸福的，他们将来不出公社就能够一直读到大学毕业，因为社里已作出开办高中和大学的规划。
    新生第一堂语文考试的作文题是“人民公社好”，要作好这篇文章，孩子们只凭课本知识是不行的，因为小学课本上还没有人民公社这个名辞。但是，在公社建立以来的一个多月里，孩子们的体会是深刻的。一个十四岁的女孩王祖春写道：“公社刚成立就买了拖拉机，修了水电站，有了幸福院，队上还办了集体食堂，社员都鼓足干劲，力争上游，为增产而献计。”
    为了明年多增产
    中秋早晨五点钟，山东历城县北园人民公社下坡干活的号声还没有响，向麦田里送粪的车辆就已往来如梭。田野里许多个熏肥火灶，早已升起浓浓白烟，把空气清新的早晨变得云雾弥漫。布满田间的翻地大军，边干边唱：干哪干，保证每亩小麦打两万斤。中秋佳节不休息，为的明年多增产。这一天他们深翻了二百亩麦田，一尺半深。
    钢铁战线上的一千多名建炉社员，苦战了三个昼夜，仍然是精神饱满，干劲冲天。他们在“不怕苦，不怕累，保证产铁五十吨，向国庆献礼”的口号声中，到晚上基本完成了三十五座土高炉和一万个坩锅的建筑任务。
    不平常的一天
    在我往郫县东风社肥料厂的路上，遇到技术员杜世康和化验员刘忠余等四人。
    他们告诉我，今天厂里有件大喜事，他们正是向公社党委会去报喜的。
    杜世康把一张大红捷报打开，原来他苦战一周试验了八次的土法制造水泥，这天上午最后试制成功了。他打开一包灰色的水泥让我看，就像机制的水泥一样。他高兴地说：“原料到处有，将来可以大量制造，公社修建新的居民区就方便了。”
    幸福院里幸福人
    9月27日，我们访问了河北安国县先锋人民公社四队舍二村幸福院。院内墙壁洁白，地扫得干干净净，一排十六间的正房，都安装着玻璃窗，擦得明亮，院内绿树成荫，还种着许多蔬菜和花草，好像个小花园。院里共住着十四个七、八十岁的老人，有一个炊事员和一个服务员侍奉着他们。我们走进幸福院的俱乐室，有三个幸福的老人正在饭后闲谈，对我们热情地招呼让坐。我们问他们有什么娱乐？七十多的老人张文林指着墙上挂的二胡、横笛和桌子上的象棋笑着说：“公社里怕我们闷的慌，买了这些玩艺，我们都是庄稼人谁会那个呀！闷的慌了就找些零活干，一来增加生产，二来锻炼身体。”在征求他们对幸福院有啥意见时，刘占山老人喜笑颜开地说：“同志！我们入了天堂啦，还有啥意见。”接着他说：“我缺儿少女，无依无靠，过去干活回来还得自己做饭，生活那有个甜！现在入了幸福院，松心啦！一天三顿饭有人侍奉着，我觉得越过越年轻，越活越带劲，这是托毛主席的福啊！”我们信步走向夫妻宿舍、男女宿舍去参观，个个院里都干干净净，被褥铺得厚厚的，桌子上陈列着风景镜、茶壶和茶碗，墙上贴着画和幸福的祝词。有的老太太在做自己的棉衣，有的老人在看报纸。当我们告别这些幸福老人的时候，身体动转艰难、耳聋眼花的张有余老人，眼里含着激动的泪花，双手合掌地说：“请你们替我写信给毛主席，祝他老人家幸福无疆。”
