    “Hero” Catches Up with “Parker”
    Shanghai-produced "Hero" gold pens have, in practical use, caught up with the famous American "Parker" gold pens.
    The Shanghai research unit concerned with gold pens recently conducted many interesting tests on "Hero" and "Parker" pens. They ground both pen nibs into the same style and placed them on the same testing instrument, drawing circles continuously on the same paper at the same speed for 200 hours. As a result, the iridium particles on the Parker pen nib wore away by 4.25 milligrams, while the Hero pen nib wore away by only 3.25 milligrams. In terms of leakage temperature difference and nib smoothness, the test results were sometimes as good as Parker pens and sometimes even better. A few days ago, at the National Pen Manufacturing Industry Conference, the quality of Hero gold pens was rated as the best in the country.

    “英雄”赶上“派克”
    上海生产的“英雄”金笔在实际使用上已经赶上美国著名的“派克”金笔。
    上海有关金笔的研究单位，最近把“英雄”、“派克”两种金笔做了许多有趣的测定。他们把这两种笔尖都磨成一个式样，放在同一个试验仪器上，在同一张纸上，以同样的速度连续画二百个小时的圆圈。结果，派克笔尖上的铱粒磨掉了四点二五公丝，而英雄笔尖只磨掉了三点二五公丝。在漏水温差、笔尖圆滑等方面，测定的结果有的和派克笔一样好，有的比派克笔还好。前几天，在全国制笔工业会议上，英雄金笔的质量已被评为全国第一。
