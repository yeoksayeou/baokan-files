Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 20th. The Politburo of the Tunisian Communist Party recently issued a statement regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between Tunisia and the United Arab Republic, saying that the current dispute between the two countries will ultimately only benefit the imperialists, because they have consistently tried to undermine the rapid development of the liberation cause of Arab countries and the unity between these countries.

The statement expressed regret over the Tunisian government's resolute step of severing diplomatic relations. It pointed out that this extreme measure has created a serious situation that will have unfortunate consequences for Tunisia itself, for all countries in the East, and for the Arab North African countries.

The statement emphasized that, in reality, this measure will isolate Tunisia in the Arab world; and now is precisely the time when Tunisia needs natural allies to deal with the various dangers constantly laid by the imperialists on its path of progress, and precisely the time when unity is needed to solve the most important problem facing the entire Arab North Africa - the Algerian question.

The statement expressed hope that normal relations between Tunisia and the United Arab Republic could be quickly restored.

    突共政治局发表声明
    突尼斯和阿联断绝关系只会有利于帝国主义者
    新华社20日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯共产党政治局最近就突尼斯—阿拉伯联合共和国断绝外交关系一事发表声明说，目前两国的纠纷，最终只会有利于帝国主义者，因为他们一贯力图破坏阿拉伯各国解放事业的飞跃发展和这些国家之间的团结。
    声明对突尼斯政府断然采取断绝外交关系的步骤这一点表示遗憾。它指出，这种极端措施造成了严重局面，它将对突尼斯本身、对所有东方的国家和阿拉伯北非国家带来不幸后果。
    声明强调说，实际上这一措施将使突尼斯在阿拉伯世界陷于孤立；而目前正是突尼斯需要天然的盟邦来对付帝国主义者不断在它前进的道路上布下的各种危险，正是需要团结一致来解决整个阿拉伯北非所面临的最重大问题——阿尔及利亚问题的时候。
    声明表示希望突尼斯和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的正常关系能够迅速恢复。
