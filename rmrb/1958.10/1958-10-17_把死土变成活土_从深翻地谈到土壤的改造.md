    Turning Dead Soil into Living Soil
    ——From Deep Plowing to Soil Transformation
　　Gao Shiqi
    To achieve a bumper harvest, we must continuously transform the soil. Today, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, our demands on the soil have greatly increased. We must command the soil to obey human will, develop in the direction desired by mankind, and enable it to better serve the great agricultural bumper harvest. Recently, the Party Central Committee summarized the rich experience of farmers in achieving high yields and issued instructions on deep plowing and soil improvement. This instruction puts forward two very important basic measures: deep plowing of the soil and layered fertilization.
    In the language of the farmers: deep plowing can turn dead soil into living soil. That is to say, to transform soil without fertility into fertile soil; to transform dead soil without production value into living soil that can produce crops.
    Layered fertilization can ensure that living soil is transformed into oily soil. Making fertile soil even more fertile, thereby obtaining high yields.
    Deep plowing of land is a traditional farming method in our country. It can change the appearance and characteristics of the soil, making the soil more conducive to crop growth.
    The advantage of deep plowing lies in its ability to thicken the loose layer of the soil and increase the pores in the soil, which can appropriately regulate moisture, air, and temperature. This is conducive to the development and extension of crop roots, strengthening wind resistance and preventing lodging.
    Although deep plowing cannot directly increase organic matter and nitrogen, it can strengthen the weathering of soil minerals, liberate a large amount of phosphorus and potassium, and greatly activate life activities in the soil.
    Deep plowing of land can conserve more and better moisture and nutrients in the soil, reducing the loss of rainwater; it also reduces the loss of moisture evaporation. Deep plowing can also level the land and improve all the harmful effects of the soil. It can eliminate weeds, pests, and toxic substances in the oxidized soil.
    However, some people still have concerns about the issue of deep plowing. They believe that if the soil layer is plowed every year, it will destroy the soil's aggregate structure and reduce the soil's fertility. Others say that if the raw soil below is turned up, it will actually reduce crop yields in the current year.
    Layered fertilization solves these contradictions.
    Layered fertilization matures the soil and increases the organic matter and humus content in the soil, making the soil even more oily from living soil.
    Organic matter and humus are cohesive. They can transform soil with a single-grain structure into soil with an aggregate structure, which can greatly improve the soil's fertility.
    In soil with a single-grain structure, the soil particles are close together one by one, and the pores between them are very small, so the ability to retain water and fertilizer is very poor. When it rains, only 30% or less of the rainwater can seep into the soil; more than 70% of the rainwater flows away from the surface. Once a sunny day arrives, the infiltrated rainwater rises along the capillaries and evaporates.
    In soil with an aggregate structure, due to the action of organic matter and humus, the single grains of soil are cemented together to form aggregates. The pores between aggregates are much larger than the pores between single grains, and there are also many small pores inside the aggregate soil. When it rains, rainwater can directly pass through the large pores between the aggregates. No matter how heavy the rain, it can seep into the deep layers of the soil. Once the rain stops, the rainwater in the large pores drains away, and air comes to take its place. When the moisture in the aggregates begins to evaporate, the evaporation of moisture from the soil below is slower because the capillary action is interrupted. Therefore, soil with an aggregate structure will not suffer from drought or flood.
    Now, the clarion call for deep plowing of the soil has sounded on the vast fields of the motherland. If deep plowing can be combined with fertilization, coupled with important measures such as close planting, large-scale high yields next year can certainly be expected.

    把死土变成活土
    ——从深翻地谈到土壤的改造
　　高士其
    为了要丰收，必须不断地改造土壤。在今天，随着农业生产的大跃进，我们对于土壤的要求更大大的提高了。我们要命令土壤服从人类的意志，向人类所愿望的方向发展，使它们能更好的为农业大丰收服务。最近，党中央总结了农民丰产的丰富经验，发布了关于深耕和改良土壤的指示。这个指示提出两项非常重要的基本措施：深翻土壤和分层施肥。
    用农民的语言来说：深翻可以使死土变成活土。这就是说，使没有肥力的泥土，变成有肥力的土壤；使没有生产价值的死土，变成能生产作物的活土。
    分层施肥可以保证活土变成油土。使有肥力的土壤更加肥沃，从而获得高额的丰产。
    深翻土地，是我国固有的一种耕作法，它能改变土壤的面貌和特性，使土壤有利于作物生长。
    深翻的好处，在于它能加厚土壤的疏松层，又能使土壤里的孔隙增大，可以适当调节水分、空气和温度，这就有利于农作物根系的发育和伸展，加强抗风力、防止倒伏。
    深翻虽然不能直接增加有机质和氮素，但是它能加强土壤矿物质的风化作用，把大量的磷素和钾素解放出来，使土壤里的生命活动大形活跃起来。
    深翻土地，能使土壤中的水分和养料保蓄得更多更好，减少了雨水的流失；同时也减少了水分蒸发的损失。深翻又可以平整土地，改良土壤的一切有害作用，它能消灭杂草、病虫害和氧化土壤的有毒物质。
    但是，有些人对于深翻问题还有顾虑。他们认为：如果每年翻耕土层，就会破坏了土壤的团粒结构，降低了土壤的肥力。又有的人说：如果把下面的生土翻上来，反而要使当年庄稼减产。
    分层施肥解决了这些矛盾。
    分层施肥使土壤熟化，增加土壤里的有机质和腐植质的成分，使土壤由活土更进一步地变成油土。
    有机质和腐植质是有胶结性的，它们能把单粒结构的土壤变成团粒结构的土壤，这样就能大大地提高土壤的肥力。
    在单粒结构的土壤里，土粒都是一个一个的紧靠在一起，它们之间的孔隙非常小，因而保水保肥的能力还很差。下雨的时候，只有30％以下的雨水能够渗到土壤里去；70％以上的雨水都从地面上流走了。晴天一到，渗下去的雨水，就沿着毛细管上升而蒸发掉。
    在团粒结构的土壤里，由于有机质和腐植质的作用，把单粒的泥土都胶结起来成为团粒。团粒和团粒之间的孔隙比单粒和单粒之间的孔隙大得多，同时团粒土壤的内部还存在着许多小孔隙。下雨的时候，雨水可以直接穿过团粒间的大孔隙，无论多大的雨水，都能渗到土壤里的深层。雨一停，大孔隙里的雨水都溜光了，随着空气就来接替它的位置。当团粒里的水分开始蒸发的时候，因为毛细管的作用被打断，下面土壤的水分蒸发就较慢。因此团粒结构的土壤就不会旱涝为灾。
    现在，在广阔无边的祖国的田野上，已经响起深翻土壤的冲锋号。如果能把深翻结合施肥工作做好，再加上密植等重要措施，来年大面积的高额丰产，一定可以拭目以待。
