    The Motor Didn't Stop
    On October 11th, the No. 4 blast furnace in the Xigang District of Sujia Village, on the outskirts of Lüda City, won a victory, producing more than two thousand catties of iron in one day.
    The next day, during production, the power suddenly went out. Watching the motor slowly stop turning, the blower couldn't send air into the furnace, the temperature inside the furnace began to drop, and the molten iron was about to solidify. The workers stood by the furnace, anxious.
    At this critical moment, a young man walked out from the crowd. His name was Yang Hongying. The young man excitedly said to everyone: "Comrades, in order to strive for greater victory, even without electricity, we must keep the motor running and continue production as usual!" After speaking, he used his hands to pull the belt on the motor. The motor started to turn. Those who had been standing aside, unable to come up with an idea for a moment, also came over to pull the belt together. With more people, there was more strength, and the motor turned quickly.
    By the time the electricity came back on, they had already fought hard for eighty minutes. By this time, everyone's clothes were soaked with sweat, and many people felt backaches and leg pain. However, no one complained of fatigue; looking at the smoothly flowing molten iron, everyone's faces showed victorious smiles. (Chen Dexiang)

    马达没有停
    旅大市郊苏家村西岗区的四号高炉在10月11日打了一个胜仗，一天炼出了两千多斤铁。
    第二天，正当生产进行中，突然停电了。眼看着马达缓缓地停止了转动，鼓风机不能往炉里送风，炉内的温度开始下降，铁水即将凝固。工人们站在炉旁，心急如火。
    就在这紧急的关头，从人群里走出来一个小伙子。他叫杨洪英。小伙子激动地对大家说：“同志们，为了争取更大的胜利，没有电，也要让马达转动，照常生产。”说完，他就用手拉马达上的皮带。马达随着转动起来。原来站在一旁一时没想出主意的人，也都走过来一齐拉皮带。人多力量大，马达飞快地转动着。
    等来了电，他们已经苦战了八十分钟。这时候，每个人的衣服都被汗水浸湿了，不少人感到腰酸腿痛。可是，谁也没有喊累；看着畅流的铁水，脸上都呈现出胜利的微笑。　（陈德祥）
