    Prevent Frost, Protect the Harvest

    According to the forecast of the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, the Yellow River Basin and the Huai River Basin may experience the first frost in mid-to-late October. This forecast tells us that the labor army fighting on the agricultural production front will be engaged in another large-scale struggle, which is to prevent frost from taking away any of the fruits of our harvest.

    China's agriculture has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests this year. The total output of grain and cotton is expected to increase by about or more than double compared to last year, and the harvests of oil crops and economic crops such as tobacco, hemp, and sugar are also much better than in previous years. Some of these exceptionally well-growing crops have already been harvested, while others are still growing in the fields. Late autumn miscellaneous grains and rice in some areas of the north, and cotton in cotton-growing areas across the country, are all in the continuing maturation stage. Late rice in southern regions is even in the late stage of growth. At present, the total area of crops still in the fields is several hundred million mu. This is a considerable figure. The greater the proportion of crops growing in the fields, the greater our task of protecting crops from frost damage. Protecting these hundreds of millions of mu of crops to grow safely and mature is another important task in current agricultural production.

    Frost damage is one of the many natural disasters in agricultural production. Like other natural disasters, people can not only predict its occurrence but also find ways to overcome it. This spring, many winter wheat producing areas experienced late frost. Because these areas mobilized the masses and adopted various preventive measures, the wheat seedlings were not damaged by frost. Not long ago, Baoyingzi Township in Chaoyang County, Liaoning, and other places also overcame the first frost that appeared, protecting the maturing rice and cotton. These facts are enough to prove that frost can be prevented. In fact, the process of agricultural production is the process of people fighting against natural disasters. Only by overcoming various natural disasters can crops achieve bumper harvests. In the past, we had the courage and strength to overcome various natural disasters. Today, we also have the courage and strength to prevent frost damage.

    Of course, preventing frost damage is not an easy task. Methods such as smoke and spraying water require a lot of manpower and material resources, and they can only be effective with strict organization. Since the basic realization of communization throughout the country, not only has the communist consciousness of the peasant masses greatly increased, and they will more actively participate in the struggle against frost; but it is also easier to uniformly allocate labor and raise the materials needed for frost prevention. These are the most favorable conditions for frost prevention this year. However, it must also be seen that today, when the whole country is vigorously engaged in iron and steel production and the tasks of autumn harvest and planting in rural areas are very heavy, if the leadership's arrangements for various tasks are improper, it will not be possible to effectively overcome frost damage. Every region and every people's commune must make comprehensive arrangements for current tasks, ensuring both the doubling of iron and steel production and the completion of autumn harvest and planting tasks, ensuring that the various crops still in the fields do not suffer any losses. This requires finding every possible way to tap labor potential, rationally allocate labor, and prevent frost damage to crops.

    Preventing frost requires certain techniques. While arranging manpower and material resources for frost prevention, all localities should also summarize and promote local frost prevention experience and organize the masses to learn frost prevention methods from other places. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen agricultural meteorological forecasting.

    An effective measure to prevent frost is to promote the early maturity of crops to prevent problems before they occur. Experience has shown that deep cultivation in cotton fields and "pushing plants together" and draining and drying fields in rice fields all have the effect of promoting the early maturity of cotton and rice. Crops that can mature one day earlier reduce the possibility of being damaged by one day. "Pushing plants together" in cotton fields can also improve the quality of cotton; draining and drying fields in rice fields also have the effect of preventing lodging in the later stage. From this point of view, using methods to promote the early maturity of cotton and rice to prevent frost damage is a win-win situation.

    For crops that can be harvested early, especially sweet potatoes, they should be harvested as soon as possible, which is also a good way to avoid frost. Among the crops that have not yet been harvested, sweet potatoes account for a large proportion, and sweet potatoes will rot in large quantities when exposed to frost. Therefore, all areas that may suffer from frost damage must be vigilant and harvest sweet potatoes as early as possible to reduce the scope of frost damage.

    With local Party committees strengthening specific leadership, carrying out strict organizational work, and mobilizing the masses to muster greater enthusiasm to fight against frost—with all of this, we will certainly be able to ensure that the fruits of the harvest that are about to be obtained are not damaged, and we will certainly be able to win a complete victory on the agricultural front this year!

### 防霜冻  保丰收

    防霜冻  保丰收
    据中央气象科学研究所的预报，黄河流域、淮河流域在10月中、下旬，可能先后出现初霜。这个预报告诉了我们：正在农业生产战线上奋战的劳动大军，又将投入另一个规模巨大的斗争，这就是不让霜冻从我们手里夺走一点丰收果实。
    我国农业今年获得空前丰产，粮食、棉花总产量预计都将比去年提高一倍左右或一倍以上，油料和烟、麻、糖等经济作物的收成也都比往年强得多。这些生长空前良好的农作物有些已经收获完了，有些还生长在田间。像北方部分地区的晚秋杂粮和水稻，全国棉区的棉花，都在继续成熟阶段。南方地区的晚稻更是处在生长后期。目前，尚在田间的作物的总面积还有好几亿亩。这是一个不小的数字。生长在田里的作物比重越大，我们防护作物不受霜害的任务就越大。保护这几亿亩作物安全地生长成熟，是当前农业生产上的又一项重要任务。
    霜冻袭击是农业生产的许多自然灾害中的一种。这种自然灾害和别的自然灾害一样，人们不但能够预测出它的发生，而且有办法战胜它。今年春季，许多冬小麦产区曾经出现过晚霜，由于这些地区发动了群众，采用了各种防御办法，使小麦的幼苗没有受到霜害。不久以前，辽宁朝阳县宝营子乡等地，也曾战胜了第一次出现的霜冻，保护了正在成熟的水稻和棉花。这些事实足以证明，霜冻是可以防范的。实际上，农业生产的过程，就是人们同自然灾害斗争的过程，只有战胜了各种自然灾害，农作物才能获得丰收。过去，我们有勇气、有力量战胜各种自然灾害，今天，我们也有勇气有力量防止霜冻灾害。
    当然，防止霜冻灾害并不是一件轻而易举的事情。像熏烟、喷水等办法，都需要大量的人力、物力，而且需要有严密的组织工作才能奏效。全国基本上实现公社化以后，不仅农民群众的共产主义觉悟大大提高，会更加积极参加防范霜冻的斗争；而且更便于统一调配劳力和筹集防霜所需要的物资；这些，都是今年防霜防冻的最有利的条件。但是，也须看到，在全国大干钢铁生产、农村秋收秋种任务十分繁重的今天，如果领导上对各项工作安排不当，就不可能有效地战胜霜冻灾害。每一个地区、每一个人民公社必须对当前各项工作加以全面安排，既要保证钢铁生产翻一翻，又要保证秋收秋种任务的完成，保证尚在田间的各种庄稼不受任何损失，这就需要千方百计地挖掘劳动潜力，合理地调配劳动力，防止霜冻对作物的为害。
    防止霜冻需要一定的技术。各地在为防霜安排人力、物力的同时，还要总结和推广当地的防霜经验，组织群众学习外地的防霜办法。此外，还要加强农业气象的预测工作。
    防止霜冻的一个有效措施，是促使作物提早成熟，以防患于未然。经验证明，对棉田实行深中耕和“推株并垅”，对稻田排水晒田，都有促使棉花、水稻早熟的作用。作物能够早熟一天，就减少一天被害的可能。对棉田“推株并垅”，还可以提高棉花质量；对稻田排水晒田，也有防止后期倒伏的作用。从这一点看，用促进棉花、水稻早熟的办法来防止霜害，是一件一举两得的事情。
    对于可以提早收获的作物，特别是甘薯，应该尽早的收回来，这也是避免霜冻的一个好办法。目前尚未收获的作物中，甘薯占的比重很大，而甘薯一遇霜冻就会引起大量腐烂。因此，凡可能遭受霜冻灾害的地区，都必须提高警惕，尽可能提前收获甘薯，以缩小霜冻为害的范围。
    各地党委加强具体领导，进行严密的组织工作，再加上发动群众鼓起更大的干劲，向霜冻进行斗争——有了这一切，我们就一定能够保证即将拿到手的丰收果实不受损害，一定能争取今年农业战线上的全胜！
