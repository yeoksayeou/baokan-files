    一场充满友谊的足球赛
    北京队昨胜阿富汗教育部队
    据新华社4日讯　应邀来我国访问的阿富汗王国教育部混合足球队今天在这里同北京足球队举行了一场友谊比赛，北京足球队以八比一获胜。
    这场球赛是在十分友好的气氛中进行的，在历时九十分钟的紧张比赛中，充分地显示了两国运动员和人民之间的友谊。
    周恩来总理和贺龙、陈毅副总理、彭真市长以及阿富汗王国驻我国大使萨马德看完比赛以后，在足球场上接见了双方运动员，并且一起照了相。
    阿富汗王国教育部混合足球队的队员体力充沛，战斗作风顽强。他们在今天比赛中，前锋推进速度快，后卫防守也比较严密。北京队一开始踢得不够冷静，锋卫之间配合较差，失误很多。上半场只攻进客队一个球。
    下半场比赛，北京队加快了进攻速度，五前锋经常一齐切入对方禁区，在四十五分钟内，北京队接连攻进了对方七个球。客队也在十六分钟时由左内锋阿尤比射入一球。终场比数成八比一。
    客队守门员巴达尔在这场比赛中，先后共救出了二十多个险球，很受观众称赞。
