    Hurrah for the Fraternal Nationalities Marching Towards Culture
    I carefully read the column "Various Nationalities Jointly Attack the Cultural Fortress" on the seventh page of the People's Daily on September 24th, and was greatly encouraged. From these reports, I learned that under the wise leadership of the Party, the cultural and scientific and technological knowledge of various fraternal nationalities is rapidly improving. I hope that the People's Daily will publish more such news in the future.

    欢呼兄弟民族向文化进军
    9月24日人民日报第七版“各族人民齐攻文化堡垒”这个专栏，我仔细看了一遍，得到很大的鼓舞。从这几篇报道中了解到各兄弟民族在党的英明领导之下，文化和科学技术知识正在飞跃地提高。希望人民日报今后多发表这样的消息。广西贵县石龙人民公社　谢树萱
