Xinhua News Agency, Shangcheng, 11th – The National On-Site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking, hosted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, opened in Shangcheng County, Henan Province, on the afternoon of the 11th. This conference will unify ideological understanding and promote the experience of indigenous steelmaking through on-site visits and practical exercises, in order to launch a vigorous and large-scale "small-scale indigenous group" all-people steelmaking movement nationwide.

Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Henan Provincial Committee to the convening of this conference in Shangcheng County.

Xia Yun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, delivered a report entitled "Indigenous Steelmaking Opens Up a Broad Road for All-People Steelmaking" at the meeting. He said that since the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel, a mass movement of all-people steelmaking has surged across the country. In just over a month, a large number of iron-smelting furnaces and indigenous steelmaking furnaces have been built nationwide, forming a steel and iron army of more than 50 million people. The speed of construction and the scale of the masses are unprecedented in world history.

Xia Yun said that there are many types of indigenous steelmaking methods in Henan. This conference will focus on introducing the experiences of two types of indigenous steelmaking: Shangcheng and Zhengzhou. The indigenous steelmaking method in Shangcheng is also called the low-temperature steelmaking method. The furnace is made of yellow mud and sand, with wooden bellows. The raw materials can be white pig iron, gray pig iron, or scrap steel. The fuel is firewood and charcoal. This method has a long history in the border area of Hubei and Henan and is a legacy of folk steelmaking. Each furnace can produce more than one ton of low-carbon steel per day using this method, and the initial tests fully meet the quality standards of low-carbon steel. Zhengzhou's indigenous steelmaking uses a reverberatory furnace. It is a furnace improved by teachers and students of the Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School based on indigenous furnaces in Weiyuan, Sichuan, and other places. It can be plastered with mud and requires only a small amount of refractory bricks and refractory mud. The blast is driven by an electric motor, and the raw materials can be waste pot iron and various types of indigenous iron. The fuel is mainly bituminous coal. This method can produce steel once an hour, with a daily output of more than one ton, and the quality also meets the standards. The common characteristics of these two methods are that they are quick to build, require little investment, are easy to operate technically, and are easy to promote rapidly among the masses. If 10,000 to 20,000 such furnaces can be promoted nationwide, low-carbon steelmaking alone can increase the country's production by more than 20,000 tons per day. This conference will also organize on-site technical exchanges on indigenous steelmaking based on the experiences of Sichuan, Shanxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Guangxi, and other places.

Xia Yun said that this conference will also further implement the policy of small-scale indigenous groups through on-site performances, exhibitions, debates, and internships, so that indigenous steel can gain its due status in people's minds and be on par with foreign steel. He pointed out that indigenous steel and foreign steel are like two legs, and we must make indigenous steel and foreign steel advance simultaneously in order to develop China's steel industry at a high speed. The facts in September proved that, under the conditions of a relative lack of technical equipment and silicon steel and manganese steel, the large-scale development of indigenous steelmaking can complete the task in a faster, better, and more economical way, and can also achieve a great leap forward in steel. At the same time, developing indigenous steelmaking can fully mobilize the masses and mobilize all positive factors, leading to unexpected miracles.

Xia Yun said that to promote indigenous steelmaking, so that indigenous steel can blossom everywhere in our country and keep pace with foreign steel, we must break down conservatism, refute skeptics, and conduct an unavoidable great debate. Is indigenous steel steel? We must first recognize the results of experimental analysis. Facts speak louder than words. The results of indigenous steel testing prove that the content of carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur generally meets the requirements of low-carbon steel. Secondly, we must recognize that indigenous steelmaking has a history of one or two thousand years in our country. It is a valuable legacy left by our ancestors. He said that the problem now is very obvious: is it better to have large but few, foreign but slow? Or is it better to have small but many, indigenous but fast? Therefore, raising the status of indigenous steel is not simply a technical issue, but a political issue.

When talking about how to expand and consolidate the achievements of indigenous steelmaking, Xia Yun said that, according to the experience of Henan in vigorously developing the steel industry, we must put politics in command, conscientiously implement the policy of small-scale indigenous groups, and organize a mass-based great leap forward in indigenous steelmaking with the spirit of continuous revolution and the method of launching satellites. Xia Yun finally called for carrying out a technical revolution in indigenous steelmaking and mobilizing the masses to strive to improve the quality of indigenous steel, expand the variety and uses of indigenous steel.

Those who have arrived to participate in this conference include the secretaries of the provincial and municipal Party committees, ministers of industry, and directors of metallurgical bureaus from twenty-four provinces and cities, as well as technical personnel, totaling four hundred people.

This newspaper, Shangcheng, 12th – On the second day of the National On-Site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking in Shangcheng, all the representatives participating in the conference visited the operating process of indigenous steelmaking on the spot and unanimously agreed that indigenous steelmaking is very good.

The county seat of Shangcheng County, dressed in festive attire, warmly welcomes the envoys from the steel front from all over the country. Several excellent indigenous steelmaking furnaces in Henan Province are concentrated here: the indigenous steelmaking furnace in Shangcheng County, the indigenous reverberatory steelmaking furnace in Zhengzhou City, and the jet engine-style three-chamber reverberatory steelmaking furnace are all showing off their power. The Sanchahe Steel Smelting Plant of the Chaoying People's Commune, which built 66 indigenous steelmaking furnaces on a blank field overnight, participated in the performance today. The three-chamber reverberatory steelmaking furnace, which only started construction on the night of the 11th, began to spew out steel flowers this morning. Next to the iron-smelting furnace of the Shangcheng County No. 1 Steel Plant, piles of broken pots and scrap iron are piled up, which are the main raw materials for steelmaking. Waste pot iron, because it contains too much phosphorus, is the worst raw material for steelmaking, but the indigenous steelmaking furnace uses it to produce very good steel. These indigenous furnaces, which take materials locally and eat whatever is available, aroused great interest among the representatives. What made the representatives even more curious was the red water stir-frying steel, that is, the molten iron flowing out of the indigenous blast furnace is immediately injected into the indigenous steel furnace for smelting. This method saves raw materials, shortens smelting time, and has high output, which is a new creation of the people of Shangcheng. The equipment for these steelmaking methods is also extremely simple. The Shangcheng indigenous steelmaking furnace has nothing else except a wooden blower and a blacksmith's hammer. The equipment of the Zhengzhou reverberatory steelmaking furnace and the three-chamber reverberatory steelmaking furnace is no more than an air blower driven by a small motor. Representatives from all over the country drew pictures while visiting, and some conducted on-site interviews, which enhanced their confidence in completing the steel production task. Representatives from the Ji'an Special Zone in Jiangxi happily said: With this indigenous method, completing the annual steel production task of 50,000 tons is no problem. They plan to build 10,000 indigenous steel furnaces after returning, so that this indigenous steelmaking will blossom and bear fruit throughout the area.

More than 600 kinds of products made of indigenous steel were also displayed on the site. There are not only various agricultural tools, household utensils, and mechanical transportation vehicles, but also small lathes and ball bearings. After seeing the products made of this indigenous steel, the representatives repeatedly praised the indigenous steel.

    河南低温炉和土反射炉开辟全民炼钢宽阔道路
    土法炼钢炼出两面红旗
    现场会议要求各地进一步开展小土群炼钢运动
    新华社商城11日电　冶金工业部主持召开的全国土法炼钢现场会议，11日下午在河南省商城县开幕。这次会议将通过现场参观和实习操作，统一思想认识，推广土法炼钢经验，以便在全国范围内开展一个轰轰烈烈的声势浩大的“小土群”的全民炼钢运动。
    中共河南省委书记杨蔚屏，代表河南省委对在商城县召开这次会议表示热烈欢迎。
    冶金工业部副部长夏耘在会上作了题为“土法炼钢开辟了全民炼钢的广阔道路”的报告。他说，自从党中央提出生产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大号召以来，全国已经形成风起云涌地全民办钢铁的群众运动。在一个多月的时间内，全国已经建成了大批炼铁炉和土炼钢炉，组成了一支五千多万人参加的钢铁大军。建设速度之快，群众规模之大，都是世界历史上所没有的。
    夏耘说，河南的土法炼钢，多种多样。这次会议将着重介绍商城和郑州两种土法炼钢的经验。商城的土法炼钢的方法也叫低温炼钢法。炉子是用黄泥和砂子做的，木制风箱，原料可用白口铁，也可用灰口铁或废钢铁，燃料是木柴和木炭。这种方法在鄂豫边界一带有着悠久的历史，是民间炼钢的一种遗产。用这种方法每个炉子每天可产一吨多低炭钢，经过初步化验完全合乎低炭钢的质量标准。郑州土法炼钢是反射炉。它是郑州农业机械化学校师生们根据四川威远等地土炉改进的炉子，可以用泥巴糊，只用少量的耐火砖、耐火泥，鼓风采取电动马达带动机械，原料可用废锅铁和各种土铁，燃料主要是烟煤。这种方法每小时可以出钢一次，日产量可达一吨以上，质量也合乎标准。这两种方法的共同特点是，建设快、投资少、技术操作简单，便于在群众中迅速推广。如果全国能够推广一万到二万个这种炉子，仅低炭炼钢一项每天就可为国家增产二万吨以上。这次大会还将根据四川、山西、湖南、贵州、广东、广西等地的经验，组织土法炼钢的现场技术交流。
    夏耘说，这次会议还将通过现场表演、展览和辩论、实习，进一步贯彻执行小土群的方针，使土钢在人们心目中获得应有的地位，与洋钢平起平坐。他指出，土钢和洋钢好比两条腿，我们必须使土钢和洋钢同时并举，才能高速度发展我国的炼钢工业。9月份的事实证明，在技术装备和矽钢、锰钢比较缺乏的条件下，大量发展土法炼钢可以多快好省地完成任务，也可以实现钢铁的大跃进。同时发展土法炼钢，可以充分地发动群众调动一切积极因素，出现想不到的奇迹。
    夏耘说，要推广土法炼钢，让土钢在我国遍地开花，与洋钢并驾齐驱同时升帐，就必须打破保守论，驳倒怀疑派，进行一场无可避免的大辩论。土钢是不是钢？要首先承认试验分析的结果，事实胜于雄辩。土钢化验结果证明：炭、矽、锰、磷、硫的含量，一般都合乎低炭钢的要求。其次，要承认土法炼钢在我国已有了一、两千年的历史。它是我们祖先留下的宝贵遗产。他说，现在的问题很明显，是大而少、洋而慢好呢？还是小而多、土而快好呢？因此提高土钢的地位并不是单纯的技术问题，而是一个政治问题。
    在谈到如何扩大巩固土法炼钢成果时，夏耘说，根据河南大办钢铁的经验，必须政治挂帅，认真贯彻执行小土群的方针，以不断革命的精神和大放卫星的方法，组织群众性的土法炼钢大跃进。夏耘最后要求开展土法炼钢的技术革命，并发动群众为提高土钢的质量、扩大土钢的品种和用途而奋斗。
    参加这次会议的，已到达的有二十四个省、市的中共省、市委书记、工业部长、冶金局长，以及技术人员共四百人。
    本报商城12日电　在全国土法炼钢商城现场会议的第二天，参加会议的全体代表实地参观了土法炼钢的操作过程，一致认为土法炼钢好得很。
    披着节日盛装的商城县县城热烈地迎接着来自全国各地钢铁战线上的使者。这里集中了河南省几种优秀的土法炼钢炉：商城县的土法炼钢炉、郑州市的土法反射炼钢炉及喷气机式的一炉三膛反射炼钢炉，都大抖威风。超英人民公社三里桥钢铁冶炼厂一夜之间在一座空白场地上，筑起的六十六个土炼钢炉，今天就参加了表演。11日夜才着手建筑的一炉三膛反射炼钢炉，在今天上午开始喷射出钢花。在商城县第一钢铁厂的炼铁炉旁，堆放着成堆的破锅与碎铁，这就是炼钢的主要原料，废锅铁对炼钢来说，因含磷过多，是一种最坏的原料，但土法炼钢炉却用它炼出了很好的钢。这几种土炉，就地取材，有啥吃啥的特点，引起了代表们的极大兴趣。使代表们更加感到新奇的是红水炒钢，即土高炉流出的铁水，马上即注入土钢炉内进行冶炼。这种方法节省原料，缩短冶炼时间，产量高，这是商城人民的新创举。这几种炼钢的设备，也极为简单。商城土法炼钢炉，除了一个木质鼓风箱及打铁锤外，别无其他。郑州市的反射炼钢炉和一炉三膛反射炼钢炉的设备，也不过多了一个小马达带动的鼓气机而已。来自全国各地的代表们，边参观边绘图，有的当场访问，增强了他们对完成钢产任务的信心。江西吉安专区代表高兴地说：有了这种土办法，完成年产五万吨钢任务，不成问题。他们计划回去后建立一万个土钢炉，使这种土法炼钢在全区开花结果。
    用土钢所制造的六百多种产品，也在现场上陈列出来。这里不仅有各种农具、生活用具、机械交通工具，还有小车床和滚珠轴承。代表们看了这种土钢所出的产品后，连连称赞土钢好。
