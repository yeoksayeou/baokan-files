Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 26th – The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba's" commentaries on the situation in the Taiwan Strait area on the 22nd and 25th fully expose what its "non-aligned policy," which is usually considered to reflect the views of the authorities, really amounts to. Disregarding the fact that the U.S. naval escort violated the prerequisite for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's suspension of the bombardment of Jinmen, and that China therefore resumed the bombardment of Jinmen, "Borba" echoed the statements of the spokespersons of U.S. and British imperialism in its commentaries on these two days, actually expressing "regret" over China's resumption of the bombardment. In its commentary on the 22nd, "Borba" said: "It is regrettable that the Chinese Ministry of National Defense declared its previous order to cease bombardment for three weeks invalid." In its commentary on the 25th, it said again: "China's resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen and Mazu (one week earlier than the scheduled deadline for the suspension of bombardment) is regrettable in any case." "Borba" completely avoided mentioning the U.S.'s violation of the prerequisite for the suspension of bombardment, although it merely lightly mentioned that "on the other hand, no active measures were taken to take advantage of the favorable situation created by the suspension of bombardment." "Borba" did not mention that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and its military provocations and threats of war are the real root cause of the tense situation in the Far East, but only said: "If the Chiang Kai-shek troops remain on the coastal islands of China, the situation in the Taiwan Strait will not ease."

Here, it is not difficult to see that this newspaper is providing arguments for the U.S. to manufacture a "Two Chinas" plot. Regarding this point, "Borba's" commentary on the 25th regarding the talks between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek is even clearer. Although the newspaper said: "Judging from the communique of the talks, the United States has not only failed to make any positive progress, but has instead further strengthened the unrealistic factors in its Far East policy," it still tried to avoid the essence of the issue—the U.S. aggression against China—and even catered to the U.S.'s intention to occupy Taiwan for a long time, treating Taiwan and Jinmen and Mazu as two separate matters. The newspaper said: "In order to eliminate the danger, it is necessary to separate the coastal islands of China from the so-called Formosa (referring to Taiwan) issue," and "to withdraw Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Jinmen and Mazu." "Borba" deliberately made it seem as if the root cause of the current tense situation in the Taiwan area is only due to the presence of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jinmen and Mazu. It said: "World public opinion demands a solution to the Jinmen and Mazu issue, demanding the withdrawal of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from these islands in order to eliminate the direct root cause of the tension in this region." Obviously, "Borba's" statement is similar to the arguments of the American bourgeois press, which is not a mere coincidence.

    南“战斗报”为美国战斗
    对我国恢复炮轰金门竟然表示遗憾
    给美国制造两个中国阴谋提供论据
    新华社贝尔格莱德26日电南斯拉夫“战斗报”22日和25日的关于台湾海峡地区形势的评论，完全暴露了通常被认为反映当局观点的这家报纸的“非集团政策”是怎么一回事。“战斗报”完全不顾这样的事实，美舰的护航，破坏了中国国防部暂停炮击金门的前提条件，因而中国恢复了对金门的炮击。“战斗报”在这两天的评论中，附和了美英帝国主义代言人的说法，竟然对中国恢复炮击表示“遗憾”。“战斗报”在22日的评论中说：“中国国防部把自己以前关于停止炮击三星期的命令宣布无效是令人遗憾的”。在25日的评论中，它又说：“中国恢复炮击金门和马祖（比停止炮击的命令的预定的期限提早一星期），无论如何是令人遗憾的。”“战斗报”对美国破坏暂停炮击的前提条件完全避而不谈，虽然，它仅仅轻描淡写地说什么“另一方面也没有利用停止炮击而造成的有利的局势采取积极的行动。”“战斗报”没有提到美国占领台湾和进行军事挑衅及战争威胁是远东形势紧张的真正根源，而只是说：“如果蒋介石军队仍在中国沿海岛屿，台湾海峡的局势就不会缓和。”
    在这里，人们不难看到这家报纸为美国制造两个中国的阴谋提供了论据。关于这点“战斗报”25日对于杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈的评论就表现得更加清楚。这家报纸虽然说到：“根据会谈公报判断，美国不仅没有作出任何积极性的进化，而是更加加强了它在远东政策中的不现实的因素”，但是，它仍然力图避开问题的实质——美国对中国的侵略，甚至迎合美国企图长期霸占台湾的打算，而把台湾和金、马说成是两回事。这家报纸说：“为了消除危险，必须把中国沿海岛屿同所谓福摩萨（指台湾）问题分开”，而“要蒋介石的军队从金门和马祖撤退。”“战斗报”故意把事情说成是，好像目前台湾地区的紧张局势的根源只是由于蒋介石军队驻在金门和马祖而产生的。它说：“世界舆论要求解决金马问题，要求蒋介石军队从这些岛屿撤退，以便消除这个地区紧张局势的直接根源。”很明显，“战斗报”的这种说法同美国资产阶级报刊的论点是异曲而同工的，而不是偶然的巧合。
