Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th. The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge Construction Committee has recently been established. This committee is jointly composed of leading bodies from the Ministry of Railways, Jiangsu Province, and Nanjing Municipality. Hui Yuyu, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, serves as the chairman, and Peng Chong, Peng Min, and Wang Zhiping serve as the vice-chairmen. The committee has already held its first meeting and has begun the exploration, design, and various preparations for the bridge, in order to officially start construction next year.

The Ministry of Railways decided to expedite the construction of the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in view of the ever-increasing volume of transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River since the Great Leap Forward. The bridge site is located near Baota Bridge in the Xiaguan District. Preliminary estimates suggest that it will exceed the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in both length and height, and the amount of work will be about three times greater than that of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The scale of the bridge construction will be rare in the world. The design and construction of this bridge will be entirely undertaken by Chinese engineers and technicians.

    南京筹建长江大桥
    新华社南京14日电  南京长江大桥建设委员会最近已经成立。这个委员会由铁道部、江苏省及南京市领导机关共同组成，由中共江苏省委书记惠浴宇任主任委员，彭冲、彭敏、王治平任副主任委员。委员会已经举行了第一次会议，并且开始了大桥的勘探、设计和各项准备工作，以便在明年正式动工兴建。
    南京长江大桥是铁道部鉴于大跃进以来长江南北运输量日益增长的需要，决定提前建设的。大桥桥址位于下关区宝塔桥附近。据初步预测，无论在长度、高度方面都要超过武汉长江大桥，工程量约比武汉长江大桥大三倍，建桥工程规模之大将为世界上少有。这座大桥的设计和建设，将完全由我国工程技术人员担任。
