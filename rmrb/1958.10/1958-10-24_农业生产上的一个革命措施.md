    A Revolutionary Measure in Agricultural Production

    Today, this newspaper publishes reports from An'guo County in Hebei Province, Shanxian County in Shandong Province, Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province, and Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi Province, on major revolutionary measures taken in agricultural production. These areas are taking a considerable amount of cultivated land from the total arable land as "high-yield zones," high-yielding fields, or "basic farmland" to cultivate large-scale high-yields, requiring an average yield of 5,000 to 10,000 jin per mu. To cultivate large areas of high-yield fields, An'guo County is vigorously promoting measures such as standardized sowing, regionalized planting, gardening-style cultivation, and superior varieties. Shanxian County, Chang'an County, and Changzhi Prefecture are also taking measures of intensive farming and meticulous cultivation. This approach is a revolution in the farming system. It points out a direction for us to accelerate the development of agriculture in the new situation. As long as we earnestly study the trend of continuous leaps in China's agriculture and the rich experience provided by this leap, we will see that the path taken by An'guo and other places in the current development of agricultural production is also the path that all parts of the country should take to develop agriculture.

    This year, China's agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with both grain and cotton production doubling. However, we are proponents of continuous revolution, and the development of agriculture cannot stop there. In reality, the grain problem is only basically resolved, not thoroughly resolved; as for cotton, oil crops, and other issues, they are even less resolved. In order to ensure greater leaps in agricultural production, we must adopt more powerful and advanced measures based on this year's experience of high yields, so that the output of various major agricultural products will achieve greater growth. This year, the average grain yield per mu in An'guo County reached 3,600 jin, an increase of more than six times compared to last year. Those right-leaning conservatives who are accustomed to doubting this and doubting that may think that this time production has reached its peak and cannot move forward anymore. Some comrades who are easily satisfied may be complacent in the face of such great production increases and slow down their pace of progress. However, the comrades in An'guo County did not think or act that way. Their eyes are always on the future, seeing far and accurately. They saw that the potential for increasing production is still very great. Therefore, they boldly adopted revolutionary measures to further accelerate the development of agriculture, determined to achieve the magnificent goal of 5,000 jin of wheat per mu next year. This fully demonstrates the communist style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to innovate, and it also fully demonstrates the communist spirit of continuous revolution and the ambition to strive for the top.

    An'guo County and other places regard cultivating large-scale high-yield fields as the fundamental measure for striving for a great leap in production next year, which is of utmost importance. These regions have selected a considerable amount of cultivated land from the total area of farmland as large-scale "high-yield zones," high-yielding fields, or "basic farmland." Irrigation water, fertilizers, and technical forces are concentrated there to ensure that the unit area yield reaches high-yield targets. This approach is a major step in implementing the "three-three system" (using one-third of the total arable land for growing crops, one-third for planting trees and grass, and one-third for fallow) farming system proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong. After implementing this farming system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest, not only can some land be freed up to accelerate afforestation, but also some labor can be saved to invest in industrial and other aspects of production and construction. This is the direction of China's agricultural development.

    The high-yield "satellites" that have emerged throughout the country this year have revealed the prospect of obtaining sufficient agricultural products on a small amount of land. However, some people still doubt: "High yields on small plots are possible, but it is impossible for large areas of farmland to achieve such high yields." These people do not understand the relationship between small area and large area. There is no impassable chasm between small and large; today it is small, tomorrow it can be large, and large is developed from small. The thousands of small-area high-yield "satellites" that have emerged across the country are not accidental products. They are merely created by people by changing production conditions such as water conservancy, fertilizer, and soil, and boldly adopting various new cultivation techniques. Since this can be done on a small area, why can't it be done on a large area? People are so enthusiastically cultivating small-area high-yield experimental fields, originally to gain experience and strive for large-area high yields. Moreover, many areas have already achieved large-area high-yields this year. The problem now is no longer whether large-area high yield is possible, but how to quickly take effective measures to achieve large-area high yield.

    What measures should be taken to ensure the realization of large-area high yield? An'guo County has adopted standardized sowing, regionalized planting, gardening-style cultivation, and so on. Among them, the most important is gardening-style cultivation. The experience of An'guo County and other regions proves that gardening-style cultivation is the most effective advanced measure to ensure high-yield increases. Its essence is to require intensive farming and meticulous cultivation. Plowing, sowing, management, irrigation, and fertilization must be refined and improved to meet strictly prescribed specifications and standards. In places where gardening-style cultivation is implemented, we see new land that people have never seen before in thousands of years: it is no longer countless fragments that are intricate, chaotic, uneven, but rather neat, "land as flat as a mirror, ridges as straight as lines" of good fields, like the most orderly vegetable garden. The land that our ancestors cultivated for thousands of years has truly turned over in the hands of our generation.

    Some people will say that taking such a high degree of intensive farming and meticulous cultivation as gardening requires a lot of manpower. Where can we find so much labor? Yes, when starting to cultivate large-scale high-yield fields, there may be a shortage of labor, but this is not an insoluble problem. We have the advanced system of people's communes, which can organize labor on a large scale; many of our rural work cadres are also learning the art of large-scale allocation of labor; the communist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the masses of peasants are unprecedentedly high; and vigorously promoting the movement to reform tools can also continuously save a large amount of labor. All of these are the most favorable conditions for solving the problem of insufficient rural labor. In the long run, cultivating large-scale high-yield fields is an effective way to solve the problem of insufficient rural labor. Because with reliable large-scale high-yield fields that guarantee increased production, we can consider appropriately reducing the planting area, or consider appropriately reducing the amount of labor used on farmland outside the large-scale high-yield fields, so as to concentrate labor on the large-scale high-yield fields for intensive farming and meticulous cultivation. This saves much more labor than using labor evenly on all cultivated land. It can be seen that in the development of the large-scale high-yield movement, the difficulties in labor can be overcome. Of course, in the process of implementing such revolutionary measures as large-scale high-yield fields, even if the difficulties in labor are solved, we may still encounter difficulties in other aspects. However, as long as we have the determination, the courage, and dare to stride towards the great goal of large-scale high yield, we will never be tripped up by difficulties, and we will definitely be able to reach our destination victoriously!

### 农业生产上的一个革命措施

    农业生产上的一个革命措施
    今天本报发表河北省安国县、山东省单县、陕西省长安县、山西省长治专区在农业生产上采取重大的革命措施的报道，这些地方从全部耕地中拿出相当数量的耕地，作为“高产片”、丰产田或“基本农田”，来培养大面积的高额丰产，要求平均每亩产量达到五千斤到一万斤。为了培养大面积的高产田，安国县正在大规模地推行播种规格化、种植区域化、耕作园田化和优种化等措施。单县、长安县和长治专区也采取精耕细作的措施。这种作法，是耕作制度的革命。它为我们在新的形势下加速发展农业指出了一个方向。只要认真地研究一下我国农业不断跃进的趋势和这个跃进所提供的丰富的经验，就会看到，安国等地在当前发展农业生产上所走的道路，也正是全国各地发展农业所应该走的道路。
    今年我国农业获得了史无前例的大丰收，粮食、棉花都加倍地增产。但是，我们是不断革命论者，农业的发展不能到此止步。实际上，粮食问题还只是基本上解决，而不是彻底解决；至于棉花、油料等问题，更没有解决。为了保证农业生产有更大的跃进，就必须根据今年丰产的经验，采取更有力、更先进的措施，使各种主要农产品产量获得更大的增长。安国县今年粮食平均亩产量达三千六百斤，比去年增长六倍多。那些惯于怀疑这怀疑那的右倾保守主义者会以为，这回可增产到顶了，不能再前进了。某些容易知足的同志面对着这样大的增产成绩，也许会心满意足，把前进的脚步放慢了。然而安国县的同志们却没有那样想，那样做。他们的眼睛总是向着前方，看得远，看得准。他们看到了增产的潜力还大得很。于是便大胆地采取了进一步加速发展农业的革命性措施，决心明年实现小麦亩产五千斤的雄伟目标。这里充分表现了共产主义者的敢想、敢干、敢独创的风格，也充分表现了共产主义的不断革命精神和力争上游的气魄。
    安国县等地把培养大面积高产田作为争取明年生产大跃进的根本措施，这一点具有十分重要的意义。这些地区都从农田总面积中选择出相当数量的耕地，作为大面积的“高产片”、丰产田或“基本农田”。在那里集中使用灌溉用水、肥料和技术力量，保证单位面积产量达到高产的指标。这种做法，正是实行毛泽东同志提出的“三三制”（用总耕地的三分之一种庄稼，三分之一种树种草，三分之一休闲）的耕作制度的重大步骤。实行这种少种、高产、多收的耕作制度之后，不但可以腾出部分土地加速绿化，而且可以节省出部分劳动力投入工业和其他方面的生产建设。这是我国农业发展的方向。
    今年全国各地出现的高产“卫星”，已经揭示了可以在小量的土地上取得足够的农产品的前景。但是仍然有人怀疑：“小块田的高产是可能的，要大面积的农田像那样高产，是不可能的。”这些人不懂得小面积和大面积的关系。小大之间并没有隔着一条天河，今天是小，明天就可以大，大就是从小发展起来的。全国各地涌现出来的千百个小面积高产“卫星”，并不是偶然的产物，它们不过是人们通过改变水利、肥料、土壤等生产条件，大胆采用各种新的耕作技术创造出来的。既然在小面积上可以这样做，为什么不可以在大面积上这样做？人们那样热心地培养小面积高产试验田，本来就是为了取得经验，争取大面积高产。而且，今年已经有不少地区出现了大面积高额丰产。现在的问题，已经不是大面积高产可能不可能的问题，而是如何迅速地采取有效的措施去实现大面积高产的问题。
    用什么措施来保证大面积高产的实现呢？安国县采取的是播种规格化、种植区域化、耕作园田化等等。其中最重要的则是耕作园田化。安国县和其他地区的经验证明，耕作园田化是保证高额增产的最有效的先进措施。它的精髓就是要求精耕细作，翻耕、播种、管理、灌溉、施肥都要精益求精，达到严格规定的规格和标准。在实行耕作园田化的地方，我们看到千百年来人们从不曾见过的崭新的土地：它已经不再是错综混乱、凸凹不平的无数碎块，而是一畦一畦的“地平如镜、畦直如线”的良田，像最整齐的菜园一样。被我们的祖先耕种过几千年的土地，到我们这一代的手里，是真正地翻身了。
    有人会说，采取园田化这样高度的精耕细作，要消耗大量的人工，哪儿去找那么多的劳动力？是的，在开始培养大面积高产田的时候，可能会发生劳动力紧张的现象，但是，这不是不可解决的问题。我们拥有人民公社这样先进的制度，可以大规模地组织劳动力；我们的许多农村工作干部也正在学会大规模地调配劳动力的艺术；农民群众的共产主义觉悟和劳动热情空前地高涨；大力推进工具改革运动，也可以不断地节省大批劳动力。所有这些，都是解决农村劳动力不足问题的最有利的条件。从长远看，培养大面积高产田，正是解决农村劳动力不足的问题的有效办法。因为有了可靠的增产保证的大面积高产田，就可以考虑适当地缩减种植面积，或者考虑适当地减少在大面积高产田以外的农田的用工量，以便把劳动力集中使用在大面积的高产田上，精耕细作。这样，比在全部耕地上平均使用劳动力要节省得多。由此可见，在开展大面积高产运动中，劳动力的困难是可以得到克服的。当然，在实行大面积高产田这样的革命性措施的过程中，就是解决了劳动力方面的困难，也还可能在别的方面遇到困难，但是，只要我们有决心，有胆略，敢于迈开大步向大面积高产的伟大目标奔驰，我们决不会被困难绊倒，我们一定能胜利到达目的地！
