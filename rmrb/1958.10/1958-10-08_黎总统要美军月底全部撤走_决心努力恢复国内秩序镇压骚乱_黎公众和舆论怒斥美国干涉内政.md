Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th - According to a report in the Beirut "al-Telegraph" on the 6th, Lebanese President Chehab has reminded U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, that American troops must withdraw from Lebanon before the end of October this year. He pointed out to the U.S. Ambassador that it is impossible to restore domestic order if U.S. troops do not withdraw from Lebanon.

"al-Telegraph" also emphasized that the conversation also touched on the issue of McClintock's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

It is reported that Chehab continued to hold talks with people from all walks of life yesterday to discuss resolving the current domestic situation. Those who met with Chehab included Speaker Oussairan, "Third Force" leaders Henri Pharaon, Youssef Sallam, Taqi-al-Din al-Solh, and others.

Beirut newspapers pointed out that Chehab is preparing the necessary conditions to convene a broad-based meeting in the form of a National Congress to discuss national reconciliation in order to extinguish certain religious conflicts that have erupted in Lebanon.

According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, Chehab said during a meeting with leaders of the Lebanese National Front on the evening of the 5th that he would use the army to suppress all riots when necessary. He also pointed out that he opposes all actions that damage the country's prestige, and these actions are condemned by the government and the people.

The radio station also said that Lebanese Prime Minister Karami, who attended the meeting, said that national reconciliation should be achieved, but not through political agreements that violate the will of the people. Lebanese National Front leader Sallam also believes that the current problem is how to restore order disrupted by certain political thugs, and not at all a question of reorganizing the Karami cabinet.

According to reports in today's newspapers, Karami said publicly yesterday, "We will never let Chamoun's supporters have the opportunity to do what they are planning, and we must destroy any attempt to realize their conspiracy." Karami also convened a meeting of senior government officials last night, instructing them to use force to stop and prevent the riots created by Chamoun's supporters.

It is reported that yesterday Chehab ordered the reinstatement of four Muslim judges who had previously been dismissed by Chamoun.

Local newspapers also reported that Chamoun's henchmen, under the direction of the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of the U.S. invading forces in Lebanon, continued to create riots throughout the country. Reactionary Phalange members placed iron nails on the roads leading to Beirut, puncturing the tires of many vehicles and then setting them on fire. Fascist National Socialist Party bandits also launched armed provocations in the Baalbek area of central Lebanon. The local anti-Chamoun uprising forces resolutely fought back, killing eleven of them. Many people on both sides were injured.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th - TASS, Cairo, 7th: Lebanese President Chehab said in an interview with the Cairo weekly "Rose al-Youssef" that the Lebanese government's primary task is to restore domestic order. The President emphasized that the government is determined to restore order and normal life in Lebanon, and will not allow any person or group to obstruct this work. Chehab said that the first measure of the policy program is to reorganize the administrative institutions, and this measure will be implemented "quickly, without waiting a month."

The reporter asked him if some people would enter the cabinet. The President replied: "The issue of cabinet members has been decided. This matter is over." Chehab pointed out that he does not intend to invite military officers to participate in the cabinet.

The President expressed his firm belief that Lebanon must maintain close ties with all Arab countries. Chehab hopes that Lebanon's relations with the United Arab Republic will return to normal.

Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report - According to Xinhua News Agency: U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock's interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, and the U.S. occupying forces' instigation of riots in Lebanon, have aroused strong dissatisfaction and criticism from Lebanese public opinion.

According to "al-Siyasah", former Lebanese Member of Parliament Abdullah al-Hajj said that McClintock's interference and his protection of Chamoun's followers once again show that the United States believes that Chamoun's failure is also the failure of the United States and the failure of U.S. policy towards Lebanon. He said: "The purpose of the U.S. Ambassador's actions is to paralyze the activities of the new government and create difficulties within the cabinet, in an attempt to prevent Lebanon from making any internal reforms or changing the foreign policy direction pursued by Chamoun in the past. McClintock's goal is precisely to maintain Lebanon's dependence on U.S. imperialism."

The "Lebanese Democratic Youth League" issued a statement, firmly condemning "U.S. Ambassador McClintock's interference in our country's internal affairs and attempts to provoke war between religious groups and create chaos in order to find excuses for the U.S. occupying forces to stay and destroy Lebanon's freedom and independence." The "Lebanese Democratic Youth League" demands that the national government indicate to the U.S. Ambassador and the U.S. government that the Republic of Lebanon is an independent and sovereign Arab country. The statement said: "Drive away the U.S. Ambassador, completely withdraw the invading troops, and stop U.S. interference in our country's internal affairs - only in this way can we restore our country's prestige and restore our people's honor and dignity."

Beirut newspapers have also published commentaries condemning the United States for inciting riots in Lebanon. The weekly "al-Khabar" published an editorial on the 6th, strongly condemning the United States for currently inciting riots in Lebanon in order to allow its troops to continue to stay in Lebanon.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon's arrogant behavior and his actions of openly interfering in matters that are purely Lebanon's internal affairs are aimed at supporting the supporters of the former regime so that they can continue to carry out criminal gangster-style activities against the new regime and against the people.

    黎总统要美军月底全部撤走
    决心努力恢复国内秩序镇压骚乱
    黎公众和舆论怒斥美国干涉内政
    新华社大马士革7日电　据贝鲁特“电讯报”6日报道，黎巴嫩总统谢哈布已经提醒美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克说，美国军队必须在今年10月底以前撤出黎巴嫩。他向美国大使指出，美国军队不撤出黎巴嫩，就不可能恢复国内的秩序。
    “电讯报”还着重指出，谈话还涉及麦克林托克干涉黎巴嫩内政的问题。
    据报道，谢哈布昨天继续同各界人士进行会谈，商讨解决当前国内局势问题。同谢哈布会谈的有议长奥塞兰、“第三力量”领袖亨利·法拉昂、优素福·萨拉姆、塔基丁·索勒哈等人。
    贝鲁特报纸指出，谢哈布正在准备必要的条件来召开国民大会形式的广泛性会议，讨论全国和解问题，以便扑灭在黎巴嫩爆发的某些宗教冲突。
    据开罗电台广播，谢哈布5日晚上在同黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖们进行会谈时曾经表示，在必要的时候，他将使用军队来镇压一切骚乱。他还指出，他反对一切损害国家威信的行为，这些行动受到政府和人民的谴责。
    这家电台还说，参加那次会谈的黎巴嫩总理卡拉米曾经表示，民族和解是应该实现的，但不是通过达成一些违背人民意志的政治性协议来加以实现。黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖萨拉姆也认为，目前的问题是如何恢复某些政治暴徒所扰乱的秩序，而根本不是什么改组卡拉米内阁的问题。
    据此间报纸今天报道，卡拉米昨天公开说，“我们永远不会让夏蒙的支持者有机会干他们所策划的事情，我们一定要摧毁实现他们阴谋的任何企图。”卡拉米在昨天晚上还召集政府高级官员开会，要他们使用武力来制止和防止夏蒙支持者制造的骚乱。
    据报道，昨天谢哈布下令恢复以前被夏蒙解职的四名穆斯林法官的职务。
    此间报纸还报道，夏蒙党徒在美国大使馆和侵黎美军总部的指使下，继续在全国各地制造骚乱。反动的长枪党徒在通到贝鲁特的各条公路上安置铁钉，使许多车辆的车胎都被戳破不能行驶，他们然后就纵火烧毁这些汽车。法西斯的国家社会党匪徒也在黎巴嫩中部的巴尔贝克地区发动武装挑衅。当地以前反对夏蒙的起义武装坚决进行回击，打死他们十一人。双方有多人受伤。
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社开罗7日讯：黎巴嫩总统谢哈布向开罗“鲁兹·优素福”周刊记者发表谈话说，黎巴嫩政府的首要任务是恢复国内秩序。这位总统强调指出，政府坚决打算恢复黎巴嫩的秩序和正常生活，不容许任何人和任何团体阻挠这项工作。谢哈布说，施政纲领的头一项措施是改组行政机构，这项措施将“很快地、不需要等一个月就可以实行”。
    记者问他是否将有一些人进入内阁。总统答道：“内阁人员的问题已经决定。这件事情已经结束了。”谢哈布指出，不打算邀请军官们参加内阁。
    总统表示深信，黎巴嫩必须同所有阿拉伯国家保持紧密联系。谢哈布希望黎巴嫩同阿拉伯联合共和国的关系将重新正常起来。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克干涉黎巴嫩的内政，以及美国占领军在黎巴嫩煽动骚乱，激起了黎巴嫩公众舆论的强烈不满和抨击。
    据“政治报”报道，前黎巴嫩议会议员阿卜杜拉·哈吉说，麦克林托克的干涉和他对夏蒙追随者的保护再一次表明，美国认为夏蒙的失败也就是美国的失败和美国对黎巴嫩政策的失败。他说：“美国大使行动的目的是要使新政府的活动趋于瘫痪并在内阁内部制造困难，是企图阻止黎巴嫩作任何内部改革或改变夏蒙过去所奉行的外交政策方针。麦克林托克的目标恰恰是要保持黎巴嫩对美帝国主义的依赖。”
    “黎巴嫩民主青年同盟”发表声明，坚决指责“美国大使麦克林托克对我国内政的干涉，并企图挑起宗教集团之间的战争和制造混乱，以便为美国占领军的留驻和摧毁黎巴嫩的自由和独立找借口”。“黎巴嫩民主青年同盟”要求本国政府示意美国大使和美国政府，黎巴嫩共和国是一个独立自主的阿拉伯国家。声明说：“赶走美国大使，全部撤退侵略军队，停止美国对我国内政的干涉——这样才能挽回我们祖国的威信，才能挽回我国人民的荣誉和尊严。”
    贝鲁特的报纸也纷纷发表评论，谴责美国在黎巴嫩煽动骚乱。“消息报”周刊6日发表社论，强烈谴责美国目前在黎巴嫩煽动骚乱，以便使它的军队继续留在黎巴嫩。
    社论指出，美国驻黎巴嫩大使的蛮横行为和他公然干涉纯粹是黎巴嫩内政的事务的行动，目的是给前政权的支持者撑腰，以便使他们能够继续进行罪恶的匪帮式的活动，反对新政权，反对人民。
