Xinhua News Agency, Honolulu, 20th: U.S. Air Force Undersecretary Mcintyre touted aggressive war in Honolulu on the 17th. He self-mockingly described the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's temporary cessation of bombardment of Jinmen for humanitarian reasons as a "retreat in the face of strong Western forces," saying that the "strategy" of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek authorities was "a very important factor" in promoting this action. Although everyone knows that China's bombardment of Jinmen is only equivalent to moving a little finger, the cessation of bombardment was conditional on the United States stopping its escort. If the United States escorts, China will resume bombardment. Mcintyre also stated that the United States will continue to carry out aggression and provocation in the Far East and the Middle East. He said: The only permanent thing we can get from the Formosa (referring to Taiwan) situation as scheduled is that crises of this nature will continue to occur in the future. They may occur in Formosa (referring to Taiwan), or in a completely different region in Asia, or in the Middle East. He also said: The U.S. Air Force will quickly go to the places where trouble occurs.
　　
Former U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Stump also clamored for the United States to take a "firm attitude" on the Taiwan Strait issue in a television speech in Buffalo, USA, on the 18th. He said that if the U.S. withdrew from the islands where Chiang Kai-shek's troops were concentrated, the prestige of the United States would decline "sharply."

    不合时宜的自我解嘲
    美空军副部长把我停止炮轰说成是退却
    新华社20日讯　檀香山消息：美国空军副部长麦金泰尔17日在檀香山鼓吹侵略战争。他自我解嘲地把中国国防部为了人道主义而暂时停止炮击金门说成是在“强大的西方力量面前撤退”，说什么美国和蒋介石当局的“战略”是促成这个行动的“一个非常重要的因素”，虽然大家知道，中国炮击金门只等于动一个小指头，停止炮击是以美国停止护航为条件的，如美国护航，中国就要恢复炮击。麦金泰尔还表示，美国将在远东和中东继续进行侵略和挑衅。他说：我们从福摩萨（指台湾）局势中能够如期得到的唯一永久性的事情就是，今后还要继续发生这种性质的危机。它们可能在福摩萨（指台湾）、或者在亚洲另一个完全不同的地区，或者在中东发生。他并说：美国空军会迅速开到出乱子的地方去。
    前美国第七舰队司令斯图普18日在美国布法罗城发表电视演说时也叫嚷美国在台湾海峡地区问题上要采取“坚决态度”。他说，如果从蒋介石军队集中的岛屿上撤退，那么美国的威望，将会“猛烈地”下降。
