Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 28th: The route for diverting water from the Han River to supplement the Huai and Yellow Rivers has been basically determined. This route will draw water from the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, passing through Xichuan, Dengxian, Nanyang, Fangcheng, Xinzheng and other counties and cities, and then flow into the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. Survey and design work on this route has already begun.

After the completion of this project, it will not only lay the foundation for further south-to-north water diversion and for diverting water from the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to the north, but also become the central section of China's future Beijing-Guangzhou Grand Canal.

Before the route was basically determined, a large-scale survey was conducted. The personnel participating in the survey went as far south as Xichuan County and the construction site of the Danjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, as far east as Dongming County, and as far west as Xingyang, passing through more than 20 counties and cities, covering a distance of more than 2,000 kilometers. After returning to Zhengzhou, they discussed the existing data and the data collected during the survey. Everyone basically reached a consensus on the important issues related to water diversion, and clarified that this project is a comprehensive utilization project for irrigation, navigation, and power generation.

    把汉水调进黄河
    据新华社郑州28日电　引汉水接济淮河、黄河的线路已基本确定。这条线路从汉水丹江口水库引水，经过淅川、邓县、南阳、方城、新郑等县市到郑州附近注入黄河。对这一线路的勘测设计工作已开始进行。
    这一工程实现后，不仅将为进一步做好南水北调，为引长江三峡水北上打下基础，而且也将成为我国未来的（北）京广（州）大运河的中段。
    在线路基本确定前，曾进行了大规模查勘。参加查勘的人员南到淅川县和汉水丹江口水库工程工地，东达东明县，西抵荥阳，经过二十多个县市，行程二千多公里。回到郑州后，又根据已有资料和查勘中搜集的资料进行了讨论。大家对有关引水的重要问题基本上取得了一致的意见，明确了这个工程是灌溉、航运、发电综合利用的工程。（附图片）
