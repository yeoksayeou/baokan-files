Having Suffered Enough at the Hands of the Americans
Gu Fan

For eight years, the American aggressors have been intensifying their control over Taiwan, a fact well known to everyone on the island. Even the newspapers and publications of the Kuomintang in Taiwan have recently stopped denying this. A recent editorial in the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily," published by the Kuomintang in Hong Kong, wrote: "We also deeply understand that, given our current situation, to expect to achieve 'equal cooperation' with the United States would be considered excessive... To put it bluntly, the United States wants to treat Chinese (Taiwanese) officials and soldiers as loyal servants, confining them in a 'life sentence' prison, while acting as the prison guards themselves."

It isn't just the "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" that compares the relationship between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek to that between prison guards and imprisoned slaves. The "Observatory," a bi-daily publication by the Kuomintang in Hong Kong, also makes this point, saying, "The United States' aid to Taiwan is meant for Taiwanese officials and soldiers to guard their bases. Taiwanese officials and soldiers are merely hired by the United States; this is by no means an exaggeration."

As for the American side, whether it's the open discussions of officials and members of Congress in Washington or the opinions expressed in American newspapers and magazines, the instances of treating the Chiang Kai-shek clique as slaves of the United States are countless. In the mouths of Eisenhower and Truman, Chiang Kai-shek was someone they could "release from the cage" or "chain up" at will. In fact, the phrases "release from the cage" and "chain up" have become common terms in American media when discussing U.S.-Chiang relations in recent years. "Release from the cage" means that the United States incites the Chiang Kai-shek clique to harass the mainland, while "chain up" means letting the Chiang Kai-shek clique maintain the current remnant situation in Taiwan. Originally, words like "release from the cage" were not used to describe human activities in the United States, just as in China. Taiwanese newspapers and publications often translate and reprint articles from American newspapers, and they have to avoid such terms when they encounter them. When Kuomintang military and government officials in Taiwan read these things in the American newspapers and magazines that flood the island, they truly "experience a unique feeling in their hearts." Indeed, American newspapers do not acknowledge the so-called "allies" or "allied nations" between the U.S. and Chiang when mentioning U.S.-Chiang relations. For example, the "Pacific Shipper" weekly, published in San Francisco, openly stated in an editorial that "Chiang Kai-shek is, after all, our puppet."

The control exerted by the United States over the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan can be described as truly aggressive. It seeks to control everything militarily, economically, and politically. The United States does this not only to easily control the Chiang Kai-shek clique and use it to expand its aggression, but also to make it easier to abandon the Chiang Kai-shek clique one day, replacing it with figures like Liao Wenyi.

The United States has established many aggressive institutions in Taiwan. These institutions primarily carry out the U.S. mission of invading Taiwan, suppressing the Taiwanese people, and preparing to expand aggression against our country. On the other hand, they also exist as institutions for the United States to control the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Among these American aggressive institutions in Taiwan, the main ones include the American "Embassy" in Taiwan, responsible for political aggression and political control over the Chiang Kai-shek clique; the Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration, which carries out economic plunder and economic control over the Chiang Kai-shek clique; and the "United States Taiwan Defense Command—Military Assistance Advisory Group Headquarters," responsible for military occupation and military control over the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In addition to these three main American aggressive institutions, there are also the United States Information Service, the "China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee," White Engineering Corporation, etc., which are responsible for carrying out aggressive activities and controlling the Chiang Kai-shek clique in cultural education, agriculture, and industrial transportation, respectively. Even for handling the veterans of the Chiang Kai-shek army, forcing these old, weak, and disabled veterans to build military bases for the United States, the United States has also established a specialized institution in Taiwan, named the "George Fry Management Consultant Company Taiwan Technical Advisory Group." As for the officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army, they are controlled by American military advisors in the Chiang Kai-shek army, and after retirement, they are still controlled by the advisors of this American management company. The pervasiveness of American control over the Chiang Kai-shek clique is evident from this.

As the rope that the United States has tied around the neck of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the "aid" that the United States has invested in Taiwan averages about 300 million US dollars per year from 1949 to the present. Among them, "military aid" accounts for slightly more than 200 million US dollars, and "economic aid" is less than 100 million US dollars. Both "military aid" and "economic aid" are attached with very harsh conditions.

According to many so-called "treaties" signed between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States, there are now about twenty American military units in Taiwan. The unified command structure for these invading American military units is the "United States Taiwan Defense Command—Military Assistance Advisory Group Headquarters." This is the supreme command for American military forces in the Taiwan area and the Chiang Kai-shek army. The magnitude of the American military structure in Taiwan can be seen from the organization of the Military Assistance Advisory Group within this American military headquarters. This advisory group has a group leader, deputy group leader, chief of staff, directors of the first to fifth departments, cartographer, operations officer, adjutant general, judge advocate, political advisor, provost marshal, postal officer, finance officer, signals officer, etc.; it also has the Taiwan Base Command, Army Group, Navy Group, and Air Force Group, with several to more than ten sections set up under each group. In total, the advisory group has about sixty departments, divisions, groups, and sections, which issue orders to the various branches of the Chiang Kai-shek army and the American advisor groups stationed in the Chiang Kai-shek army. The American military advisors regard themselves as "supreme emperors" everywhere in the Chiang Kai-shek army. Their work extends to all departments of the Chiang Kai-shek army, including land, sea, air, logistics, artillery, engineering, intelligence, and communications. American military advisors often inspect the Chiang Kai-shek army's companies, platoons, and squads. American military advisors are not only responsible for the supply, combat, and training of the Chiang Kai-shek army, but they also often formulate and inspect the Chiang Kai-shek army's internal affairs and dress codes. Some American military advisors are responsible for directly checking whether the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers' weapons are wiped clean without a speck of dust and whether there is dirt on their shirt collars. If Chiang Kai-shek soldiers are a little careless during inspections, the American military advisors will send a "memorandum" to the higher authorities, causing them to be punished. Every time the Chiang Kai-shek army's planes take off, ships go to sea, a bunker is built, or a barrel of gasoline is used, approval must be obtained from the American military advisors. Even the appointment, removal, promotion, or training of some Chiang Kai-shek military officers must be approved by the American military advisors. The officers and soldiers of the 76th Regiment of the 26th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army often discuss: "We can't even make our own decisions when building a bunker, and we still have to be directed by Americans." "American devils point fingers everywhere, we have become their slaves." The United States is gradually intensifying its control over the Chiang Kai-shek army through military advisors.

The Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration, responsible for economic control of Taiwan, has more than fifty departments, groups, advisor offices, and commissioner offices. The titles are numerous, such as executive officer, financial advisor, economic and financial analysis specialist, planning analysis specialist, construction advisor, fisheries advisor, agricultural vocational education specialist, shipping specialist, small industry advisor, coal mine geology specialist, metal and non-metal geology specialist, industrial management and distribution advisor, etc. This huge "US Aid" institution extends its suction cups for American economic plunder into all aspects of Taiwan's industry, mining, agriculture, fisheries, and transportation. The US Aid Utilization Committee, Economic Stabilization Committee, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Taiwan Bank under the Executive Yuan of the Chiang Kai-shek clique often have Americans participate in their meetings. Officials sent by the Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration participate in the meetings under the name of "observers," but in reality, they control the real power of every economic measure. American economic control and plunder penetrates into many industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan. The United States even annexed the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation under the name of "leasing," turning it into the Taiwan branch of the American Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation. After the Taiwan Power Company accepted "economic aid" funds from the United States with very high interest rates, the Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration repeatedly coerced the Taiwan Power Company to repeatedly increase electricity prices in order for the United States to seize huge profits. Such things are countless.

The intensified control and enslavement by the United States in Taiwan has not only aroused the anger of the Taiwanese people but also aroused dissatisfaction among the Kuomintang military and government personnel. United Press International reporter Miller wrote that "anti-Americanism" is flourishing on the island of Taiwan, and "many Americans believe that the most basic need is for American officials to universally recognize or acknowledge the fact that anti-American sentiment in Taiwan is very tense." Obviously, the flourishing anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese people cannot but have an increasingly profound impact on the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan whose conscience has not been obliterated. Especially since the American aggressors do not treat them as human beings and insult them arrogantly, they all feel the same way. Among the lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army, an undercurrent of anti-American military advisors has formed, which makes the invading American military extremely troubled. In recent years, many "legislators" and "supervisory committee members" in Taiwan have also repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with their subordination to the United States, and have revealed their aversion to the deepening control and enslavement that the United States has imposed on them. When one "legislator" talked about Taiwan's economic situation, he angrily questioned the Executive Yuan of the Chiang Kai-shek clique: Is Taiwan's "financial and economic policy independent and autonomous? Or is it controlled by others?" He also asked: "Do I use US aid? Or does US aid use me?" Many legislators and supervisory committee members also demanded that the Taiwan authorities abolish the "extraterritoriality" enjoyed by Americans in Taiwan, and demanded that "independent and autonomous policies" be adopted in the future, and that "sovereignty" not be abandoned. Many facts show that many Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan realize that relying on external forces to maintain the remnant situation brings them not only a long night of humiliating life but also the hidden worry of being sacrificed, and will also leave a bad name for ten thousand years. Patriotism does not distinguish between early and late, but what about selling out the country? What to do? Has become a question that many people in the Taiwan military and government personnel cannot but think about. (Attached picture)

    吃尽了美国人的苦头
    古凡
    八年以来，美国侵略者愈来愈加紧对台湾的控制，这是台湾尽人皆知的事。甚至台湾国民党出版的报纸刊物，近来也不讳言这一点了。台湾国民党在香港出版的“工商日报”最近发表的一篇社论写道：“我们也深深明白，我们今日的处境，要期望做到和美国‘平等合作’的地步，会被认为过分……说句不中听的话，美国要把中国（台湾）官员士兵做忠仆，安置在一个‘无期徒刑’的监狱里，而自为监狱官。”
    把美蒋关系比喻为监狱官和被囚禁的奴仆之间的关系的，不只是这家“工商日报”。台湾国民党在香港出版的“天文台”两日刊也有这一说法，并且说，“美国之援助台湾，是要台湾官员士兵替它守基地。台湾的官员士兵们就是美国的雇佣者，这绝不是苛论。”
    至于美国方面，不管是华盛顿的官员和议员们的公开谈论或者是美国报纸杂志的言论，把蒋介石集团视作美国的奴隶的，那真是数不胜数了。在艾森豪威尔和杜鲁门的口中，蒋介石是可以随便让他们“放出笼”或“拴起来”的。事实上，“放出笼”和“拴起来”这两句话，近年来已经成为美国舆论界谈论美蒋关系时的专用词汇。“放出笼”的意思就是美国驱使蒋介石集团骚扰大陆，“拴起来”的意思就是让蒋介石集团维持着目前在台湾的残局。本来，像“放出笼”这类词汇，在美国也像在中国一样，并不是用来写人的活动的。台湾的报纸刊物常常译载美国报刊的东西，遇到这种词汇的时候只好加以避讳。台湾国民党军政官员在泛滥于台湾的美国报刊上读到这些东西，真是“别有一番滋味在心头”。确实，美国报刊提到美蒋关系的时候，并不理会所谓美蒋之间是“盟友”、“盟邦”这些自欺欺人的一套。例如，在旧金山出版的“太平洋装货人”周刊在一篇社论中公然说，“蒋介石毕竟是我们的傀儡”。
    美国在台湾对蒋介石集团的控制，可以说真是咄咄逼人。它要在军事上、经济上、政治上都一把抓。美国这样做，一方面固然为了便于控制蒋介石集团和利用它扩大侵略。另一方面，也为了美国有朝一日需要抛弃蒋介石集团，用廖文毅之流来替代的时候，可以更加顺手。
    美国设立在台湾的侵略机构很多。这些机构主要是执行美国侵略台湾和镇压台湾人民，准备扩大侵略我国的任务。另一方面，它们也是作为美国对蒋介石集团进行控制的机构而存在的。
    在这些美国侵略台湾的机构中，主要的有负责政治侵略和在政治上控制蒋介石集团的美国驻台湾“大使馆”；进行经济掠夺和在经济上控制蒋介石集团的美国国际合作署台湾分署；负责军事侵占和在军事上控制蒋介石集团的“美国台湾防卫司令部一军事援助顾问团总部”。除了这三个主要的美国侵略机构以外，另外还有美国新闻处、“中国农村复兴委员会”、怀特工程公司等等，分别负责在文化教育、农业、工业交通等方面进行侵略活动和控制蒋介石集团。甚至为了处理蒋介石军队的退伍军人，强迫这些老弱残废的退伍蒋军替美国修筑军事基地，美国在台湾也设立了一个专门的机构，名为“乔治富莱管理顾问公司驻台湾技术顾问团”。以蒋介石军队的官兵来说，他们在蒋军中要受美国军事顾问的控制，而退役以后，仍然要受到这个美国管理公司的顾问们的控制。美国对蒋介石集团控制的无孔不入，由此也可见了。
    作为美国套在蒋介石集团脖子上的绳索，从1949年到现在，美国平均每年投在台湾的“援助”约值三亿美元。其中“军事援助”占了二亿美元多一点，“经济援助”不足一亿美元。不管是“军事援助”或者是“经济援助”，都附有非常苛刻的条件。
    依照蒋介石集团同美国签定的许多所谓“条约”，现在美国在台湾一共大约有二十个军事单位。这些侵台美军单位的统一指挥机构是“美国台湾防卫司令部一军事援助顾问团总部”。这是台湾地区美军和蒋介石军队的最高司令部。侵台美军机构的庞大，可以从这个美军总部内的军事援助顾问团的组织看出来。这个顾问团设有团长、副团长、参谋长、一至五处处长、制图官、作战官、副官长、军法参谋、政治顾问、宪兵司令、邮务官、财务官、信号官等；还设置了台湾基地司令部、陆军组、海军组、空军组，各个组下面分别设置了几个到十多个科。计算起来，顾问团设有六十个左右的部、处、组、科的组织，分头对蒋军各兵种和驻在蒋军各部队的美军顾问小组发号施令。美军顾问团对于蒋介石军队处处以“太上皇”自居。他们的工作范围伸展到蒋军陆、海、空、后勤和炮兵、工兵、情报、通讯等各个部门，美国军事顾问常常到蒋军的连、排、班去视察。美军顾问不但负责蒋军的供给、作战和训练，甚至蒋军的内务和着装规则等，也常常由他们制定和检查。有一些美军顾问负责直接检查蒋军士兵的武器是否擦拭得没有一丝尘土，衬衫领上有没有污垢等等。蒋军官兵受检查的时候稍有一点疏忽，美国军事顾问就会向上级机关送上“备忘录”，使他们受到处罚。蒋军的飞机起飞一次，舰艇出海一次，修筑一个碉堡，动用一桶汽油，都要获得美国军事顾问的批准。甚至一些蒋军军官的任免和升迁或调去训练，也要美国军事顾问的同意。蒋军二十六师七十六团的官兵们常常议论说：“我们连修一个地堡都做不了主，还要受美国人指挥”。“美国鬼子处处指手划脚，我们成了他的奴隶。”美国通过军事顾问一步步地加紧对蒋军的控制。
    负责在经济方面控制台湾的美国国际合作署台湾分署，设有五十多个处、组、顾问办公室、专员办公室等。其中的名目繁多，如执行官、金融顾问、经济财政分析专员、计划分析专员、营建顾问、渔业顾问、农业职教专员、航业专员、小型工业顾问、煤矿地质专员、金属及非金属地质专员、工业管理和分配顾问等等。这个庞大的“美援”机构，无孔不入地把美国进行经济掠夺的吸盘，伸展到台湾工业、矿业、农业、渔业、交通运输等各个方面。蒋介石集团行政院属下的美援运用委员会、经济安定委员会、经济部、财政部以及台湾银行等财经机构，在开会的时候常常有美国人参加。这些美国国际合作署台湾分署派出的官员以“观察员”的名义参加会议，但是实际上却操纵着每项经济措施的实权。美国进行的经济控制和掠夺，渗透到台湾的许多工矿企业单位。美国甚至以“租赁”为名，吞并了台湾造船公司，把它改为美国英加尔斯造船公司在台湾的分公司。台湾电力公司接受了美国利息很高的“经济援助”款项以后，美国国际合作署台湾分署连年胁迫台湾电力公司一再提高电价，以便美国攫取暴利。这类事情数不胜数。
    美国在台湾的加紧控制和奴役，不但引起了台湾人民的愤怒，也引起国民党军政人员的不满。合众国际社记者米勒写道，“反美主义”正在台湾岛上蓬勃生长，“许多美国人认为，最基本的需要是要美国官方普遍认识到、或者承认这个事实，那就是台湾的反美情绪是很紧张的。”显然，台湾人民蓬勃增长的反美情绪，不可能不给予良心未泯的台湾国民党军政人员以日渐深刻的影响。尤其是美国侵略者把他们不当作人看待，盛气凌辱，他们都是感同身受的。在蒋介石军队的中下级官兵中，已经形成一股反美国军事顾问的暗流，这使得侵台美军十分头痛。近年来，台湾的许多“立法委员”们和“监察委员”们，也一再发出对屈从美国表示不满的言论，并且对美国给他们的控制奴役步步加深流露了反感。有一个“立法委员”谈到台湾经济情况的时候，气愤地质问蒋介石集团行政院：台湾“财经措施是独立自主的？还是受人支配的？”又问：“是我运用美援？还是美援运用我？”许多立法委员和监察委员们还要求台湾当局取消美国人在台湾享有“治外法权”，要求今后采取“独立自主的政策”，不要“放弃主权”。许多事实表明，不少台湾国民党军政人员认识到依赖外力维持残局，给他们带来的不只是长夜漫漫的屈辱生活，并且是被人牺牲的隐忧，还将遗臭万年。爱国不分先后，卖国还是爱国？何去何从？已经成为台湾军政人员中许多人不能不思考的问题。（附图片）
