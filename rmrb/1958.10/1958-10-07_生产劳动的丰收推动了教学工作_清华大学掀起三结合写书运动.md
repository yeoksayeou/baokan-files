    Bumper Harvest of Productive Labor Promotes Teaching Work
    Tsinghua University Launches Three-Way Combination Book Writing Campaign
    (Our newspaper reporter Zhu Bin reports) Tsinghua University, on the basis of a bumper harvest in productive labor, has launched a vigorous book writing campaign using the method of Party Committee leadership and a three-way combination of teachers, students, and workers to summarize experiences and compile teaching materials, textbooks, and scientific and technical books. A lively situation of workers, students, and teachers learning from each other has formed.
    All students who have participated in productive labor, regardless of whether they are in higher or lower grades, have joined teachers and workers in the movement to write books and summarize experiences. Inheriting the "guerrilla habits of the countryside," they are working hard day and night. Some people engage in productive labor during the day and write under the lamp until dawn at night; others write continuously for forty-eight hours or fifty-six hours. The books they write cover a wide range, including highly theoretical introductions to various projects, basic principles of various majors, as well as construction techniques for various projects and design and manufacturing techniques for machines such as automobiles and internal combustion locomotives. Currently, specialized teams are writing lecture notes for all major theoretical and professional courses in the school's eleven departments and thirty-plus majors.
    Judging from the lecture notes that have been written, they have three significant characteristics: First, they run through the principle of guiding practice and have a certain degree of dialectical materialism. All laws, formulas, and experiences in the books clearly state the conditions of their creation, the trends of development, and the subjective initiative of people. Second, they implement the Party's General Line and related guidelines and policies. For example, the courses in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering include large, medium, and small-sized water conservancy projects; the course in Agricultural Water Conservancy has added the main experiences of soil and water conservation; and the lecture notes in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering include both indigenous and foreign methods. Third, there are some creations and inventions by Tsinghua University teachers and students in production or scientific research, as well as advanced experiences from various industrial fronts in the country and the latest technologies in the world. These lecture notes have fundamentally changed the past tendency of teaching materials to be divorced from politics and reality.
    Tsinghua University's book writing movement developed from the participation of students and teachers in productive labor. In March of this year, Tsinghua University organized a large number of teachers and students to participate in productive labor in factories and construction sites both on and off campus. In early August, in accordance with the principles of the theory of practice, all teachers and students began to summarize the gains from productive labor and, based on the Party's educational policy, examined and criticized the old teaching plans and syllabi and formulated new teaching plans and syllabi. In this reform, the old framework in which teaching work could only be handled by a few teachers was broken, and students and teachers were mobilized to cooperate. At the time, many people expressed doubts about doing so. They said that students, by definition, are here to "learn"; if they haven't finished learning, how can they be in charge of "teaching"? Some teachers, based on personal feelings, felt that in the past, teachers always lectured and students listened, and now they couldn't bear to be reversed. Each department debated this issue. In the debate, everyone objectively analyzed the situation of the students. Most people believed that the current students, after the rectification and anti-Rightist movements and the "two antis," the vast majority support the Party's leadership, are enthusiastic about taking the socialist road, and strive to study Marxism-Leninism. They not only have some professional knowledge from books, but also have participated in labor and have some practical knowledge. They are a huge collective; one student's knowledge and ability are certainly not much, but when dozens or hundreds of students are united, their wisdom increases. Some department Party branches also first led a group of students to conduct pilot projects and compiled better teaching syllabi and teaching plans. This convinced those who were skeptical and opposed. It also made teachers and students further realize that using the mass line and mass movement methods to engage in teaching work can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results on the one hand when teachers and students cooperate to set teaching plans; on the other hand, it can also summarize the existing experience of productive practice and apply it to teaching, which is a correct path to improve oneself.
    In early September, the third-year students of the Automotive and Tractor Specialty of the Power Department, in cooperation with workers and teachers, first summarized their five months of experience in repairing automobiles and wrote a 50,000-word "Automobile Repair Studies." Many people who read this book believed that it had flesh, blood, and bones, and could be used to run an automobile repair factory or as a textbook. The Tsinghua University Party Committee immediately seized this advanced model and promoted it throughout the school, and the trend of writing books immediately became a mass movement.
    There are also various methods of writing books. Some focus on summarizing their own production and design experience; such books can be used as teaching materials for the next class of students participating in this labor. Others, on the basis of summarizing their own production and design experience, further investigate and collect materials from advanced factories and mines in various places, and summarize the advanced experience of these departments into teaching materials. The teaching materials written in this way can make up for the lack of experience of teachers and students and make the content richer. Currently, the fourth-year students of the Foundry Specialty in the Department of Mechanical Engineering are using this method to compile teaching materials for four courses for the fifth grade, including Foundry Technology Automation, Casting Quality Inspection, and Foundry Workshop Design.
    The work of writing books is carried out collectively with division of labor. Each group is only responsible for one book. In the Drainage Specialty of the Department of Architecture, more than one hundred students are divided into twelve groups and are jointly writing a lecture on the construction of water supply and drainage pipelines, and each group only writes one chapter of the entire lecture. In order to exchange information in a timely manner and give full play to the collective strength, they send representatives to the stage to speak after each group has written a chapter. Those who listen below include not only students, but also teachers and workers. After the student representative finishes speaking, everyone asks questions. If the speaker cannot answer some questions, the teachers and workers will supplement them. Then the group responsible for writing that chapter will revise the lecture notes according to these opinions. (Attached picture)

    生产劳动的丰收推动了教学工作
    清华大学掀起三结合写书运动
    本报讯　记者朱彬报道：清华大学在生产劳动丰收的基础上，采用党委领导，教师、学生、工人三结合的方法掀起了轰轰烈烈地总结经验编写讲义、教科书和科学技术书籍的写书运动。形成了工人、学生、教师互教互学的生动局面。
    全校参加过生产劳动的学生，不分高年级低年级都和教师、工人一起投入了写书总结经验的运动。他们承继着“农村的游击习气”，不分日夜地大干特干。有的人白天生产劳动，晚上在灯下写到天亮，有的人连续写四十八小时、五十六小时。他们所写的书涉及的范围很广，有理论性较强的各种工程概论、各个专业的基本原理，也有各种工程的施工技术和汽车、内燃机机车等机器的设计制造技术。现在全校十一个系三十多个专业的各项主要理论课、专业课所用的讲稿，都有专门的小组在写作。
    从已写出的讲稿来看，具有三个显著的特点：第一，贯穿了指导实践的原则，并具有一定的辩证唯物主义思想。书中所有的各项定律、公式、经验，都写明了产生的条件、发展的趋势，以及人的主观能动性。第二，贯彻了党的总路线和有关方针政策。如水利系的各门课程中有大中小型水利工程；在农田水利学中增加了水土保持的主要经验；在机械、电机等系的讲稿中就有土有洋。第三，有清华大学师生们在生产中或科学研究中的一些创造发明，也有当前国内各个工业战线上的先进经验，世界上的最新技术。这些讲稿基本上改变了过去教材中脱离政治、脱离实际的倾向。
    清华大学的写书运动是由学生、教师参加生产劳动发展而来的。今年3月间，清华大学就组织了大批师生在校内校外工厂和工地上参加生产劳动。8月初，全校师生按照实践论的原则开始总结生产劳动中的收获，并依据党的教育方针检查批判了旧的教学计划和教学大纲，制订了新的教学计划和教学大纲。在这项改革中，打破了教学工作只能由少数教师包办的旧框框，而发动了学生和教师共同合作。当时不少人对这样做表示怀疑。他们说学生顾名思义是来“学”的，学还没学完怎么能管起“教”来呢？有的教师从个人意气出发认为：以往一贯都是教师讲学生听，现在要反过来受不了。各系就这个问题进行了辩论。在辩论中大家客观地分析了学生的状况。多数人都认为目前的学生经过整风反右、双反，绝大多数都拥护党的领导，热心走社会主义道路，努力学习马列主义。他们不但有一些书本上的专业知识，而且参加了劳动，也具有一些实践知识。他们是一个巨大的集体，一个学生的知识和能力固然不多，但几十几百个学生联合在一起他们的智慧就多了。有些系的党总支还先领导了一部分学生作试点，编出了较好的教学大纲和教学计划。这样就说服了那些怀疑派、反对派。也使师生们进一步体会到这样用群众路线和群众运动的办法来搞教学工作，一方面师生合作订教学计划可以作到多快好省；另一方面也可以把已有的生产实践的经验加以总结，运用到教学上去，是提高自己的一条正确道路。
    动力系汽车拖拉机专业三年级的学生9月初和工人、教师首先合作总结了自己五个月来修理汽车的经验，写成了五万字的“汽车修理学”。不少人读了这本书后，都认为它有血有肉有骨头，可以用它办汽车修理厂，也可以用它作教科书。清华大学党委立即抓住这个先进的典型在全校推广，写书之风立即就成了群众运动。
    写书的方法也有多种多样，有的以总结自己的生产设计经验为主，这样的书可以作下一班的学生参加这项劳动的教材。也有的在总结自己的生产设计经验的基础上，又进一步到各地各个先进厂矿企业调查搜集资料，把这些部门的先进经验也总结到教材中去，这样写出的教材，可以补师生们的经验不足，内容更加丰富。现在机械系铸工专业四年级的学生正在用这个办法编写五年级的铸工工艺自动化、铸件品质检验、铸工车间设计等四门课的教材。
    写书的工作是分工集体进行的，每一个组只担负一本书，在建筑系排水专业里，一百多个学生分成十二个小组，共同在写一本上下水道管道施工讲义，而每一组只写全部讲义的一章。为了及时交流情况，发挥集体的力量，他们每个组写好一章后就推代表上台讲。在下面听的不仅有学生，也有教师和工人。学生代表讲完后大家就提问题，有些问题主讲人答不出，就由教师和工人来补充。然后负责写作这一章的小组再按照这些意见修改讲稿。（附图片）
