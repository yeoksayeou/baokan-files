    Fiberglass Cement Boat

    (Our report) Staff members of the Concrete Research Office of the Cement Research Institute of the Ministry of Building Construction, after fifteen days of hard work, successfully trial-produced a fiberglass cement boat on September 24.

    This boat is seven meters long, 1.8 meters wide, has a displacement of six cubic meters, and a carrying capacity of 3.5 to 4 tons. The estimated cost is 1,500 yuan, equivalent to one-half of the price of a similar type of wooden boat and one-twentieth of the price of a fiberglass boat. Its advantages are simple manufacturing, sturdiness and durability, corrosion resistance, anti-corrosion, mothproof, fire resistance, impermeability, and a certain impact strength. After launching tests, the performance is very good. It can seat more than 30 people. It can be driven by a motor, manpower, or sails.

    The research and application of fiberglass cement is a cutting-edge science and technology in the world. China has only been carrying out this work for half a year. This new type of material is made of cement slurry as a cementing agent to bond glass fibers. Its elasticity, crack resistance, and flexural strength all exceed concrete, and it is easier to manufacture than steel wire cement, and its performance can be comparable to it. It can replace steel and wood for industrial and civil buildings, for shipbuilding, and for manufacturing machine casings, bases, etc. Because the raw materials are easy to obtain and the price is low, this new material has great development prospects.

    玻璃纤维水泥船
    本报讯　建筑工程部水泥研究院混凝土研究室职工经过十五天苦战，在9月24日试制成功一艘玻璃纤维水泥船。
    这艘船长七公尺，宽一点八公尺，排水量六立方公尺，载重量达三点五到四吨。估算成本为一千五百元，相等于同类型木船价格的二分之一，玻璃钢船价格的二十分之一，它的优点是制造简便，坚固耐久，防腐、防蚀、防蛀、耐火、不透水，并有一定的冲击强度。经下水试验，性能很好。能坐三十余人。可用马达、人力或船帆来带动。
    玻璃纤维水泥的研究与应用，在世界上是尖端性的科学技术，我国开展这项工作还只有半年。这种新型的材料，是用水泥浆做胶凝剂来粘结玻璃纤维制成的。它的弹性、抗裂性和抗折强度都超过混凝土，比钢丝水泥容易制造，性能方面则可与之比美。它可以代替钢材、木材，用于工业和民用建筑，用来造船，制造机器外壳、底座等。由于原料易得，价格低廉，这种新材料很有发展前途。
