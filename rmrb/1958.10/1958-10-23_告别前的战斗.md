　　When the train entered Xuancheon Station, it encountered a heavy rain. Before long, news came: the railways and bridges between Xuancheon and Sinuiju had been washed out in several places, and the train could not proceed. Lieutenant Colonel Zhao Zenglin, the head of the unit, immediately convened an emergency meeting with the responsible officers from each carriage to study and arrange for the repair of roadbeds and bridges.

　　The responsible comrades of the local Workers' Party specifically came to the station to take care of the unit's meals and rest. When they learned that the officers and soldiers were going to assist in repairing the roadbed and bridges, they refused to allow it, not wanting the officers and soldiers to be tired out again just before leaving Korea. After a dispute, they were forced to agree.

　　At dawn the next day, more than three hundred officers and soldiers, full of energy, set off for Donglim with tools such as picks and shovels. Xu Zhen, the battalion commander of the engineering battalion, upon hearing that he was being left behind, immediately said to the leadership, "I am an engineer. Soldiers cannot desert before a battle. I must participate." Instructor Hu Qinghua, who had a cold, also resolutely requested to join the repair team. The military doctors also formed a first aid and safety security team. Under the slogan of "Using practical actions to thank the Korean people for their care in the moment before farewell," the officers and soldiers, regardless of the rain soaking their clothes, worked with soaring enthusiasm. In just four hours, they cleared the accumulated water and leveled the roadbed at three disaster-stricken sections of the line from Donglim to Namsi Station. Then, everyone marched to Liangchaek to repair the roadbed and bridges.

　　After nearly twenty hours of hard work, the roadbeds and bridges that had been washed away were finally completely repaired, allowing trains to pass through the Xuancheon to Sinuiju section of the railway without any obstruction. When the comrades put down their picks, packed their gear, and boarded the train to continue their journey, countless people from Xuancheon rushed to the station to see them off, waving to the officers and soldiers for a long time, thanking them for the friendship they had left behind in their final moments.

    告别前的战斗
    许培如
    列车驶入宣川车站时，遇上了暴雨。不一会，传来了消息：宣川至新义州之间的铁路和桥梁，有几处被水冲坏，列车不能行驶。部队首长赵增林中校，立即召开了有各个车厢负责干部参加的紧急会议，研究和布置了抢修路基和桥梁问题。
    当地的劳动党的负责同志特地赶到车站来照料部队的膳食和休息问题，当他了解到官兵们要去协助抢修路基和桥梁时，说什么也不让动，他不愿意官兵们在临离朝时，再去劳累。经过一场争执，他被迫同意了。
    第二天拂晓，三百多名官兵个个精神充沛，拿着洋镐、铁铲等工具向东林进发。工兵营营长许振听说把自己留下，立即向领导提出：“我是工兵，行军不能临阵脱逃，一定要去参加。”患了感冒的指导员胡庆华，也坚决要求参加抢修队伍。军医们也组成了急救和防险保安小组。官兵们在“告别的前一刻，用实际行动来感谢朝鲜人民的关怀”的口号下，不顾雨水淋衣，干劲冲天，只四小时，就将东林至南市站一带的三处遭灾的线路，排除了积水，垫平了路基，然后大家又进军到良策一带抢修路基和桥梁。
    经过近二十小时的奋战，终于全部修复了被水冲坏的路基和桥梁，使一列列的火车毫无阻碍地通过宣川至新义州段的铁路。当同志们放下铁镐，整装登车继续前进的时候，无数的宣川人民赶到车站送行，长久地向官兵招手致意，感谢大家在最后时刻留下的友谊。
