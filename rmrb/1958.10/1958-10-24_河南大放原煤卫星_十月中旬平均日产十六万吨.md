Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd -- In mid-October, Henan Province's average daily raw coal output reached over 160,000 tons, an increase of two and a half times compared to the average daily output in September. On the 20th, the province created a record high of 636,663 tons of daily output. By the 20th, the province's raw coal production had already exceeded the state's October plan. Xuchang Prefecture has overfulfilled the annual raw coal production plan by 5% eighty days ahead of schedule.

In these ten days, counties, mainly relying on "small, indigenous, and mass" methods, created one high-yield raw coal record after another. Linru County's daily output exceeded the 200,000-ton mark, reaching 208,830 tons; Yuxian, Bo'ai, and Shanxian exceeded the 100,000-ton mark; Baofeng County exceeded the 50,000-ton mark; and Lushan County and Xichuan County exceeded the 10,000-ton mark.

Large mines, fighting alongside the small coal mines in various counties, also continuously tapped their potential and improved technical operations, resulting in a daily increase in output. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's average daily output has been over 20,000 tons since the 15th, and on the 15th, it created an unprecedented record of over 40,000 tons of raw coal daily output. In the week from the 13th to the 19th, the mining bureau's raw coal output exceeded the weekly plan by 57.91%, earning the title of the province's first "Satellite Mine."

Since the beginning of October, Henan Province has increased the number of newly opened small coal kilns of various types to more than 3,650. The raw coal output of small coal kilns accounts for the vast majority of the total output in various regions. In the production of small coal kilns, the open-pit coal mines mined by the masses themselves have shown tremendous superiority. Linru County's daily raw coal output on the 15th was more than 71,000 tons, 90% of which was produced by 26 open-pit coal mines, and one open-pit coal mine in Mangchuan Township produced more than 40,000 tons. Before creating a record of 100,000 tons of raw coal daily output, Yuxian summarized the advantages of open-pit coal mining being fast, high-yielding, economical, and technically simple, and mobilized the masses throughout the county to engage in open-pit coal mining on a large scale, adopting methods of comprehensive development, focusing on key targets, and large-scale stripping, opening twenty-three open-pit coal mines in a few days.

    河南大放原煤卫星
    十月中旬平均日产十六万吨
    新华社郑州23日电　河南省10月中旬的原煤平均日产量达到了十六万吨以上，比9月份平均日产量增加两倍半，20日更创造了全省日产六十三万六千六百六十三吨的最高纪录。到20日为止，全省原煤生产已经超额完成10月份的国家计划。许昌专区已提前八十天超额5％完成全年的原煤生产计划。
    在这十天内，各县以“小、土、群”为主创造的原煤高产纪录，一个接着一个地出现。日产量突破二十万吨大关的有临汝县，达到二十万八千八百三十吨；突破十万吨大关的有禹县、博爱、陕县；突破五万吨的有宝丰县；突破万吨的有鲁山县和淅川县。
    同各县小煤矿并肩作战的大矿井，也不断挖掘潜力，改进技术操作，使产量逐日上升。焦作矿务局从15日开始，每天的平均产量都在二万吨以上，15日还创造了日产原煤四万多吨的空前纪录。这个矿务局在13日到19日一周中，原煤产量超过周计划57.91％，荣获了全省第一个“卫星矿”的称号。
    河南省从10月初以来，新开采的各式小煤窑增加到了三千六百五十多个。小煤窑的原煤产量占了各地总产量的绝大比重。在小煤窑生产中，群众自己开采的露天煤矿更显示了巨大的优越性。临汝县15日日产原煤七万一千多吨，其中90％是依靠二十六个露天煤矿生产的，蟒川乡一个露天煤矿就生产了四万多吨。禹县在创造日产十万吨原煤的纪录以前，曾总结了露天煤矿开采快、产量高、开支节省、技术简单的优越性，发动全县群众大搞露天煤矿，采取全面开花、重点突击和大揭顶的方法，几天之内就开采了二十三个露天煤矿。
