    Jilin Province Exceeds Steel Production Target Last Month
    Heilongjiang Produces 1,300 Tons of Steel Daily

    (Our dispatch) Jilin Province exceeded its national target of producing 3,000 tons of steel in September. By September 29th, the province had already produced 3,414.41 tons of steel.

    After the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the call to double steel production, a mass movement of the whole party and the whole people to run the iron and steel industry rapidly took shape throughout Jilin Province. Although the people of Jilin Province had never made steel before, they were determined to produce 100,000 tons of steel this year. Many party and government leading cadres in various units moved to the front of the steelmaking furnaces, eating and sleeping beside them, fighting day and night. Various localities adopted the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods to accelerate the construction of crucible furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces. On September 26th, only twenty-six furnaces in the province were making steel, but by the 29th, this number had increased to fifty-five. Now, the people of the province are determined to produce 21,000 tons of steel in October, with an average daily output of 700 tons.

    (Our dispatch) On September 29th, under the attack of cold currents and heavy rain, steelworkers in Heilongjiang Province still created the province's highest daily output of pig iron, 494 tons, an increase of 2.19 times compared to the 28th. On the 29th, steel production also reached 1,340 tons.

    In the past two days, Heilongjiang Province has been hit by cold currents, with temperatures dropping to minus 1.2 degrees Celsius. The cold wind, accompanied by torrential rain, seriously threatened the production of iron-smelting furnaces. However, these difficulties did not affect the fighting spirit of the iron and steel army. They braved the rain and stood firm beside the furnaces. Construction workers from various factories and construction sites brought tools to support them, rushing to rescue the iron-smelting furnaces that were in danger under the impact of the rain. Steelworkers from various factories in Harbin stayed by the furnaces day and night, using new technologies such as enlarging the furnace bottom to increase the daily steel output from 99 tons to 334 tons, an increase of nearly two and a half times in one day. Hundreds of mechanized small blast furnaces that are being newly built throughout the province are also under construction in the heavy rain. On the 29th alone, fifty-nine new indigenous small blast furnaces were put into production, while only fifteen indigenous small blast furnaces were originally in production. Therefore, pig iron production in many areas has increased exponentially.

### 吉林省上月超额出钢  黑龙江日产钢一千三百吨

    欢庆九月放卫星　预祝十月大丰产
    吉林省上月超额出钢
    黑龙江日产钢一千三百吨
    本报讯　吉林省超额完成9月份产钢三千吨的国家计划，到9月29日，全省就炼钢三千四百一十四点四一吨。
    中共中央政治局扩大会议发出钢产量翻一番的号召以后，全党全民大办钢铁工业的群众运动在吉林全省迅速形成。尽管吉林省人民从来没有炼过钢，但是他们决心在今年生产十万吨钢。许多单位的党、政领导干部都搬到炼钢炉前，吃在炉旁，睡在炉旁，日夜奋战。各地采取土洋并举的方针，加快建设坩锅炉、转炉和电炉。9月26日全省只有二十六个炉子炼钢，到29日就增加到五十五个。现在，全省人民决心在10月份炼二万一千吨钢，平均日产量要达到七百吨。
    本报讯　9月29日在寒流和大雨的袭击下，黑龙江省钢铁工人仍创全省生铁最高日产量四百九十四吨，比28日提高了二点一九倍。29日钢的产量也达到了一千三百四十吨。
    这两天来，黑龙江省遭到了寒流袭击，气温下降到摄氏零下一点二度，寒风带着滂沱大雨严重威胁着炼铁炉的生产。但是这些困难并没有影响钢铁大军的斗志，他们冒雨坚守在炉旁，各工厂、工地的建设工人都带了工具前去支援，随时抢救在雨水冲击下告急的炼铁炉。哈尔滨各厂炼钢工人昼夜守在炉旁采用加大炉底等新技术使钢的日产量从头一天的九十九吨提高到三百三十四吨。一天产量增加近两倍半。全省正在新建的数百座机械化的小高炉，在大雨中也紧张地施工，29日一天新投入生产的洋小高炉就有五十九座，而原来生产的洋小高炉只有十五座。因此许多地区生铁产量就成倍地提高。
