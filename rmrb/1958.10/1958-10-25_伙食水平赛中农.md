    The public mess hall of the Fifth Company of the Fourth Battalion of the Shangyou People's Commune in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, has implemented the policy of running the mess hall diligently and thriftily. Currently, the quality of food has surpassed the living standards of middle peasants.
    Now, not only do all commune members not have to pay for meals, but they also eat better than they did at home. Each person can eat seven liang of vegetables and two liang of fish and shrimp per meal, and sometimes they can have extra dishes. Everyone has pork to eat. The middle peasant Huang Zao Sheng said, "Now we eat even better than at home."
    How did this mess hall manage to do so well? Because after the mess hall was established, they assigned some people to engage in sideline occupations in a big way and mobilized everyone to think of ways to eat better. As a result, three of the five cooks were assigned to fish, and the fishnets were provided by the commune members. The seven irrigation personnel in the company also catch fish and shrimp for the mess hall when they finish watering; elementary school students go to pick snails for the mess hall to make dishes after school. In this way, the mess hall not only does not have to ask commune members to pay for vegetables, but also has more fish and shrimp than they can eat because they catch so much. The mess hall also raises 37 pigs, 71 geese, 371 ducks, and 370 chickens, and has planted more than 20 mu of vegetables. In the future, everything except oil and salt can be self-sufficient.

    伙食水平赛中农
    广东中山县上游人民公社第四营第五连的公共食堂，由于贯彻了勤俭办食堂的方针，目前在伙食质量上已经超过中农生活水平。
    现在全体社员每天吃饭不单不用给钱，而且还比他们在自己家里吃得好。每餐每人都可以吃到青菜七两，鱼虾二两，有时还可以加菜，人人有猪肉吃。中农黄早胜说：“现在比家里吃得还好。”
    这个食堂怎么办得这样好呢？因为他们在食堂办起来以后，就分配一部分人去大搞副业，并发动大家都为吃得更好想办法。结果在五个炊事人员中抽了三个去捞鱼，鱼网都是由社员拿出的。连内的七个排灌人员在放完水的时候，也捞鱼虾给食堂；小学生放学回来都去拾田螺给食堂做菜。这样食堂不但不用让社员拿菜钱，而且因鱼虾捞的多，吃不完。食堂还养了猪三十七头，鹅七十一只，鸭三百七十一只，鸡三百七十只，并已种了蔬菜二十多亩。以后除了油盐以外，全部都可以自供自给了。
