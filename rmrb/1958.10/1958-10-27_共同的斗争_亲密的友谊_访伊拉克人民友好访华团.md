    Common Struggle, Close Friendship
    —A Visit with the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China

The militant friendship forged between the Chinese and Iraqi people in their common struggle has rapidly advanced to a new historical stage since the victory of the Iraqi revolution. During a recent interview with the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, which had returned to Beijing after visiting various parts of our country, head of the delegation, Mahmoud, and many members, expressed their most sincere feelings for the Chinese people with tones full of close friendship, asking the reporters to convey these sentiments.

     "Our visit to China is a historically significant event in the friendly relations between the Chinese and Iraqi people, and also the happiest moment of our lives," said Head Mahmoud enthusiastically at the beginning of our conversation. "The people of China, Iraq, Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been engaged in a common struggle in the past and present, which is the struggle against imperialism, the struggle to completely eliminate imperialism from the earth. From our visits to various parts of China, we have seen that the Chinese people deeply understand and support us. We want to cooperate with such people forever and support each other forever."

    "The Iraqi government and people realize that the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands is our own struggle, the struggle of the Iraqi people. In this struggle, we fully support you!" Head Mahmoud said firmly.

On the battlefront against imperialism, the Chinese and Iraqi people will always stand heart-to-heart. Head Mahmoud pointed out that this view was also the common view of all members of the delegation. He said: "When we departed from Baghdad, we were friendly envoys sent to China by the Iraqi people, and when we return to Baghdad shortly, we will become friendly envoys from the Chinese people to Iraq. We will convey to all the Iraqi people the great achievements China has made after getting rid of the shackles of imperialism, as well as the profound friendship of all the people, both in cities and villages, towards the Iraqi people, without missing any details."

Guests from the emerging revolutionary country spoke with great passion about the achievements of the Chinese people in the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, showing that they regarded China's achievements as their own. Delegation member Hairi told reporters that amidst the warm welcome of thousands of workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, they excitedly wrote the following congratulations on the factory's blackboard newspaper on behalf of the entire delegation: "Every ton of steel and iron here is a blow to imperialism. Imperialism is our common enemy. Congratulations on your more brilliant achievements in the Great Leap Forward." Hairi excitedly told the reporter: "The sparks of steel and iron at Anshan illuminate the path for the people of Asian and African countries to ultimately get rid of the shackles of imperialism!"

    "In an Eastern country that accounts for a quarter of the world's population, there is happiness everywhere, and it contains incomparably huge potential. Those who do not understand this fact are blind; those who understand this fact but pretend not to understand are ostriches who only bury their heads in the sand," wrote delegation member Duraha in a written statement at the reporter's invitation. He also pointed out: "The most exciting thing is that the Chinese people ask nothing of the Arab people, but they extend a hand of support full of sincere friendship to the Arab people. This is because the Arab people are people who are fighting for freedom and against colonialism, and their struggle is a just struggle. This is the most unforgettable impression I got when I visited China."

While the reporter was talking with delegation member Safwani, editor-in-chief of the Iraqi "Awakening Daily," in a reception room at the Beijing Hotel, Hafeidell, one of the leaders of the Iraqi Independence Party, also came from his bedroom to join our conversation. He expressed that when he learned that a Chinese reporter had come to their residence, he couldn't help but want to convey his feelings of friendship to the Chinese people through the newspaper. Safwani and Hafeidell told the reporter that the Chinese people are advancing by leaps and bounds in their great construction cause, and their growing strength is a serious blow to imperialism. The Chinese people, the Arab people, and all the people of Asia and Africa have united as never before, and this unity is an indestructible iron wall.

    "Imperialism has reached old age, and it is time for the awakened people of the East, the people of Latin America, and the people of the whole world to rise up and end its fate!" When Safwani used these words to express his firm will against imperialism, Hafeidell then said: "The Chinese people and the people of Arab countries have formed a huge historical force. They will simultaneously tighten the noose around the neck of imperialism in the Far East and the Near East until they strangle them to death!"

Whether it was Head Mahmoud or other members of the delegation, when they described their deepest impressions of visiting China to the reporter, they also talked about the heroic struggle of the Iraqi people against imperialism and domestic reactionary forces for a long time, and how they enthusiastically looked forward to the victory of the Chinese revolution in the difficult years of the past. This situation not only aroused our infinite admiration for the heroic Iraqi people, but also made us more deeply understand the profound foundation of the militant friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people.

The Iraqi people's struggle against imperialist colonial rule and the domestic reactionary dynasty has lasted for forty years. In these forty years, people have stepped forward one after another, regardless of sacrifice, and countless touching deeds of struggle have emerged. In this fifteen-member delegation, the head and many members had been in prison and suffered painful exile in the past struggles. They had been imprisoned for a total of forty years, and they themselves were participants and witnesses of the long and heroic struggle of the Iraqi people. Hairi, who spent fourteen young years in prison before the revolution, told the reporter that in the 1920 national revolutionary movement against British imperialist aggression alone, 100,000 Iraqis participated in large-scale armed struggles. This struggle lasted for more than half a year. In an attack on the British invading army, the insurgents annihilated four brigades of the enemy at once. At that time, some British troops attempted to retreat from one place, and thousands of peasants ambushed along the way. They climbed onto trains and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy using spears, bayonets, and daggers. Although the enemy, fully equipped with modern weapons, had a retreat distance of only one hundred kilometers, it took them a full twelve days. The oil workers, who have a long and glorious revolutionary tradition, held a general strike for twelve consecutive days in 1946. The imperialists surrounded the meeting place of the workers and ordered the shooting of twelve workers, but the heroic workers were not only not intimidated, but they carried the bodies of their dead comrades, broke through the encirclement, took to the streets, and launched a larger-scale strike demonstration. Over the years, imperialist colonialists and their running dogs have imprisoned and exiled thousands of patriotic people to the desolate desert, but patriotic people have also turned prisons and exiles into places to continue the struggle. They have continued to carry out various political struggles. One hunger strike lasted as long as twenty days. In November 1956, despite the suppression of the people by imperialists and domestic reactionaries with airplanes and artillery, the Iraqi people launched a wave of demonstrations and strikes against colonialism and reactionary rule throughout the country, which lasted for more than two months. Hairi said: "Although this revolutionary movement still failed, it educated the people and made them understand that to fight against enemies armed to the teeth, they must have their own armed forces. This revolution actually made direct preparations for the July 14th revolution this year."

The Iraqi guests also told reporters that during their long and arduous struggles in the past, many Iraqi revolutionary fighters risked imprisonment, exile, and even the sacrifice of their lives to secretly read Mao Zedong's works at night. When they heard the news of the founding of the People's Republic of China in prison, everyone was overjoyed, toasted each other with water instead of wine, and warmly celebrated. Whenever they talked about this, the Iraqi friends said to the reporter in extremely excited tones: "Now, we have come to this great country in person, and we toast the Chinese people with the finest wine for the brilliant achievements they have made in construction!"

    共同的斗争　亲密的友谊
    ——访伊拉克人民友好访华团
    新华社记者　袁　木　于民生
    中国和伊拉克人民在共同的斗争中结成的战斗友谊，在伊拉克革命胜利后又迅速地跨进了一个新的历史阶段。在记者最近访问从我国各地参观后回到北京的伊拉克人民友好访华团时，马哈茂德团长和许多团员，都以充满了亲密友情的语调，要求记者转达他们对中国人民最诚挚的感情。
      “我们对中国的访问是中伊人民友好关系上的一个有历史意义的事件，也是我们一生当中最幸福的时刻。”马哈茂德团长在同我们的谈话一开始，就这样热烈地表达了他的感情：“中国、伊拉克、亚非和拉丁美洲人民，过去和现在都在进行着一个共同的斗争，这就是反对帝国主义的斗争，是把帝国主义从地球上彻底消灭的斗争。我们从中国各地的参观访问中看到，中国人民深刻地了解我们，支持我们，我们就是要同这样的人民永远合作，永远互相支持。”
    “伊拉克政府和人民都认识到，中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争，就是我们伊拉克人民自己的斗争，在这个斗争当中，我们全力支持你们！”马哈茂德团长坚定地说。
    在反对帝国主义的战线上，中国和伊拉克人民将会永远心连心地站在一起。马哈茂德团长指出他的这种看法也是访华团全体人员的共同看法。他说：“我们从巴格达动身的时候是伊拉克人民派到中国来的友好使者，而我们不久以后再回到巴格达时，就将成为中国人民访问伊拉克的友好使者。我们将把自己看到的中国在摆脱帝国主义的束缚以后所取得的巨大成就，以及无论城市和乡村的所有人民对伊拉克人民的深厚情谊，都一起转达给全体伊拉克人民，决不放过任何一个细节。”
    来自新兴的革命国家的客人们在谈到中国人民在社会主义建设全面大跃进中所取得的成就时，他们的声调是那样的充满激情，可以看出他们是把中国的成就也看做是他们自己的成就。代表团团员哈依里告诉记者，在鞍山钢铁公司成千工人的热烈欢迎声中，他们曾经以全团人员的名义，激动地在工厂的黑板报上写下这样的祝贺：“这里的每一吨钢、每一吨铁，都是对帝国主义的打击。帝国主义是我们的共同敌人，祝贺你们在大跃进中取得更加辉煌的成绩。”哈依里激动地对记者说：“鞍山的钢花和铁水，照亮了亚非国家人民最终地要摆脱帝国主义束缚的道路！”
      “在占有世界四分之一人口的一个东方国家里，这里无处不是幸福，这里蕴藏着无比巨大的潜力。不懂得这个事实的人就是瞎子；懂得这个事实而假装不懂的人，他们就是只会把头埋在沙子里的鸵鸟”，团员杜拉哈在应记者的邀请写的书面谈话中这样写道，他并且指出：“最令人激动的是，中国人民对阿拉伯人民无所要求，而他们却向阿拉伯人民伸出了充满诚挚情谊的支援之手。这原因就是因为阿拉伯人民是争取自由和反殖民主义的人民，他们的斗争是正义的斗争。这是我访问中国时所得到的最难忘的印象。”
    当记者在北京饭店的一间会客室中正同代表团团员、伊拉克“觉醒报”主编萨夫瓦尼谈话的时候，代表团团员、伊拉克独立党领导人之一的哈费德尔也从他的卧室中走来参加我们的谈话。他表示当他知道有中国记者来到他们的住所以后，怎么也抑制不住要通过报纸向中国人民转达友谊的感情。萨夫瓦尼和哈费德尔对记者说，中国人民正在伟大建设事业中大踏步前进，他们的力量的日益增强，就是对帝国主义的严重打击。中国人民、阿拉伯人民和所有亚非人民已经空前地团结起来，这种团结是任何力量都不能摧毁的铜墙铁壁。
      “帝国主义已经到了老年，是应该由觉醒了的东方人民、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民起来结束它的命运的时候了！”当萨夫瓦尼用这样的话来表达他反对帝国主义的坚定意志的时候，哈费德尔紧接着说：“中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民已经结成了一股巨大的历史的力量，他们将在远东和中近东同时拉紧套在帝国主义脖子上的绞索，直到勒死它们才能罢手！”
    无论是马哈茂德团长或者是代表团的其他团员，他们在向记者叙述访问中国的最深刻的印象时，也曾经谈到伊拉克人民长期同帝国主义和国内反动势力进行英勇斗争的事迹，以及他们在过去的艰苦年代中是如何热情地期待着中国革命的胜利，这种情况不仅激起了我们对英雄的伊拉克人民的无限敬佩，并且使我们更深刻地理解了中伊两国人民战斗友谊的深厚基础。
    伊拉克人民同帝国主义殖民统治和国内反动王朝的斗争已经有了四十年的历史。在这四十年中，人们前仆后继，不惜牺牲，出现了无数可歌可泣的斗争事迹。在这个十五人的代表团中，团长和许多团员在过去的斗争中都曾经坐过监狱，经受过痛苦的流放生活，他们总共被监禁的时间就有四十年，他们本身就是伊拉克人民长期英勇斗争的参加者和目击者。革命胜利前在监狱中度过十四年年青的岁月的哈依里举例告诉记者，仅在1920年的一次反对英帝国主义侵略的民族革命运动中，伊拉克就有十万人参加了大规模的武装斗争。这次斗争一直持续了半年多。起义者在一次袭击英国侵略军的战争中，一下子就消灭了敌人的军队四个旅。当时，有一部分英国军队企图从一个地方撤退，成千成万的农民在沿途伏击，他们爬上火车用梭标、刺刀和匕首同敌人肉搏，全副现代化武装的敌人的撤退路程虽然只有一百公里，但却整整用了十二天的时间。有着长期光荣革命传统的石油工人在1946年曾经举行了持续十二天的总罢工，帝国主义者包围了工人们开会的会场，下令枪杀了十二名工人，但英勇的工人们不仅没有被吓倒，他们却抬着死难同伴的尸首，冲出重围走上街头，展开了更大规模的罢工示威游行。多少年来，帝国主义殖民者及其走狗把成千成万的爱国志士关进监狱，放逐到荒凉的沙漠，而爱国志士却把监狱和流放地也变成了继续战斗的场所，他们持续不断地进行各种政治斗争，有一次绝食斗争竟达二十天之久。1956年11月，尽管帝国主义者和国内反动派用飞机大炮对人民进行镇压，而伊拉克人民却在全国范围内掀起了一个反对殖民主义和反动统治的游行示威和罢工运动，这个运动一直持续了两个多月。哈依里说：“这次革命运动虽然还是失败了，但它却教育了人民，使他们懂得同武装到牙齿的敌人进行斗争，必须有人民自己的武装，这次革命实际上为今年7月14日的革命作了直接的准备。”
    伊拉克的客人们还告诉记者，当他们在过去那长期的艰苦斗争中，许多伊拉克革命斗士曾经冒着坐牢、流放甚至牺牲生命的危险，偷偷地成夜地阅读毛泽东的著作。而当他们在监狱中听到中华人民共和国成立的消息时，大家欢乐非凡，以水代酒，互相干杯，热烈庆祝。每当谈到这里的时候，伊拉克的朋友们都以极度兴奋的语调对记者说：“现在，我们亲自来到了这个伟大的国家，并且用最美的酒为中国人民在建设中取得的辉煌成就而干杯！”
