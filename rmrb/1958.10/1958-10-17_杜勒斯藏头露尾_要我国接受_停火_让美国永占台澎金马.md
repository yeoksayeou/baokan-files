Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Washington Dispatch: US Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on the 14th at a press conference in Washington regarding the order from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense for a two-week extension of the ceasefire of the shelling of Jinmen. This statement once again confused the issue by equating the international dispute between China and the US caused by the US’s aggressive actions in the Taiwan Strait with the internal affair of the Chinese people unifying their own territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Matsu. The statement indicated that the US wants to insist on interfering in China's internal affairs and force the Chinese people to accept the so-called "long-term ceasefire" and the US's occupation of Taiwan.

Dulles's statement said: "The United States welcomes the Chinese Communists' decision on October 12 to continue the cessation of shelling of Jinmen. We hope that this cessation of shelling will in fact exceed the two weeks mentioned. A short cessation of armed attacks does not provide a solid basis for stabilizing the situation in the interest of peace."

Dulles also said in his statement: "We will strive for peace while honorably fulfilling our obligations to our allies and the world order."

Dulles then pointed out that the US's "obligation" mentioned here is that the US must fulfill the US-Chiang Kai-shek military treaty to "defend" Taiwan. This exposes that Dulles's "seeking peace" is to have the Chinese people recognize the US's banditry of invading China.

There is an "irreconcilable" contradiction between US imperialism and the Chinese people on the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands, Dulles himself said. Dulles's current approach is to continue to use flowery language to peddle his conspiracy to achieve a "reliable ceasefire" to the Chinese people. China's announcement of a pause in the shelling of Jinmen was originally a measure in China's civil war, which has nothing to do with the United States, and the United States has no right to interfere. But Dulles insisted on saying that China's suspension of shelling "may just be a trick" and that "there is basically nothing reliable that we (the United States) can trust in their attitude." At the same time, he also said that if the Chinese people agree to implement a "reliable ceasefire" that abandons territorial sovereignty and tolerates US aggression, then "quite a few things will naturally happen. The situation will almost automatically undergo considerable changes, just like an unambiguous logical problem."

However, even the stubborn Dulles had to admit helplessly in the same conversation that, so far, the US's attempts to peddle its conspiracy to the Chinese people have failed. He said that on the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands, "there is nothing to bargain with the Communists. In all our talks, whether in Warsaw or elsewhere, in everything they have said, there is no indication that you can reach an agreement with the Communists on these islands."

The fact is that the Chinese people have seen through Dulles's conspiracies and tricks. Behind the "ceasefire" trick is the US's occupation of Taiwan, Penghu, and direct involvement in Jinmen and Matsu. Regarding Jinmen and Matsu, Dulles said that the United States "does not favor handing these islands over to the Chinese Communists," and he even openly said, "Even if the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) agrees," the United States is "unwilling." This clearly shows that the United States is determined to directly control these islands in China's inland sea as a springboard for aggression against the Chinese mainland at any time. At the same time, Dulles himself also exposed the meaning of the US's so-called plan to reduce the Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed in Jinmen. He said that reducing the Jinmen Chiang troops is purely a "troop deployment issue," and "the troop deployment issue is entirely about how to most effectively and powerfully use existing troops." He said that this military deployment is for "greater flexibility and a wider range of operations, and they can return to Jinmen when needed." This completely exposes the US's ambition to expand its aggression against China.

Dulles's conversation involved the relationship between the United States and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group in many places. News from Taipei shows that the United States' actions in accordance with its own interests have caused panic and dissatisfaction among the Taiwan authorities. Dulles's remarks were published against this background. Dulles said, "In the past, the United States tended to think that there were too many troops there, exceeding the needs of the situation, and we still hold this view. But the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group) maintains its opinion." He admitted that US Secretary of Defense McElroy went to Taipei to "discuss how to most effectively deploy the Republic of China's troops" with the Chiang Kai-shek group. McElroy intended to have Chiang Kai-shek agree to reduce the Jinmen troops in exchange for the United States increasing the firepower there.

Due to fear of further irritating the Chiang Kai-shek group, Dulles deliberately concealed the truth and dared not publicly disclose it. He pretended to say that reducing the Jinmen troops "is mainly a matter to be decided by the Republic of China (the Chiang Kai-shek group)," "I don't want to leave people with the impression that we are urging or intend to urge the Republic of China (the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group) to take some action against its own better judgment."

When talking about the impact of his last press conference on September 30, in which he said that the Chiang Kai-shek group's "return to the mainland" was hopeless, Dulles revealed the US's concerns, saying: "I think people must be very cautious and not say anything that would cause Taiwan to make a wrong interpretation, but it is easy for such things to happen."

In answering questions from reporters, Dulles admitted that although the United States did not want to submit the Taiwan issue to the United Nations and the International Court of Justice in order to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs, this conspiracy was difficult to achieve because the Chinese people resolutely opposed it and world public opinion did not support the United States.

Because the US's policy of playing with fire on the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands has caused a wave of condemnation in the United States and created an extremely unfavorable situation for the Republican Party in the upcoming US congressional elections, Dulles called for no arguing over foreign policy in the election campaign. He said: "It is unwise to raise some aspects of current foreign policy in the election campaign." He hoped that the Democratic and Republican parties "on both sides would calm down in this aspect of the debate." He admitted that he had discussed with Eisenhower and cabinet members to "find ways" to prevent the discussion of foreign policy issues in the election debate.

### 杜勒斯藏头露尾  要我国接受“停火”让美国永占台澎金马

    杜勒斯藏头露尾
    要我国接受“停火”让美国永占台澎金马
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯14日在华盛顿的记者招待会上就中国国防部关于对金门的炮击再停两星期的命令发表了声明。这个声明再一次混淆视听地把美国在台湾海峡地区的侵略行动所引起的中美两国国际争端同中国人民统一自己的国土台湾、澎湖和金门、马祖的内政问题混为一谈，声明表示美国要坚持干涉中国内政，迫使中国人民接受所谓“长期停火”和美国霸占台湾的事实。
    杜勒斯的声明说：“美国欢迎中国共产党在10月12日作出的继续停止炮击金门的决定。我们希望这次停止炮击事实上将会超过所提到的两星期。短时间的停止武装袭击并不能提供巩固的基础来稳定局势以利于和平。”
    杜勒斯在声明中还说：“我们将在光荣地履行我们对我们的盟国和世界秩序所负的义务的情况下努力谋求和平。”
    杜勒斯紧接着就指出，这里所谈的美国的“义务”就是美国要履行美蒋军事条约来“保卫”台湾。这就暴露了，杜勒斯的“谋求和平”就是要中国人民承认美国侵略中国的强盗勾当。
    美帝国主义同中国人民在台湾和沿海岛屿问题上有“不可调和”的矛盾，杜勒斯自己也这样说。杜勒斯目前的做法是：继续用花言巧语来向中国人民兜售他的实现“可靠的停火”的阴谋。中国宣布暂停炮击金门，本来是中国内战中的一个措施，这同美国毫无关系，美国根本无权过问。但是杜勒斯偏偏要说什么中国暂停炮击“可能只是一个诡计”，“在他们的态度方面根本没有什么我们（美国）可以信赖的很可靠的东西”。同时他又说，如果中国人民同意实行放弃领土主权和容忍美国侵略的“可靠停火”，那么“就会自然而然地发生相当不少的一系列的事情。局势差不多就会像毫不含糊的逻辑问题一样，自动地发生相当可观的变化”。
    但是，连顽固的杜勒斯也不得不在同一篇谈话里无可奈何地承认，迄今为止，美国向中国人民兜售它的阴谋的作法失败了。他说，在台湾和沿海岛屿问题上“没有什么可以同共产党讨价还价的。在我们的所有会谈中，不管是在华沙也好，别处也好，在他们所发表的一切言论中，没有任何迹象说明你能够在这些岛屿问题上同共产党达成协议。”
    事实是，中国人民对杜勒斯的阴谋诡计已洞察无遗了，在“停火”诡计的后边是美国霸占台湾、澎湖和直接插手金门、马祖。关于金门、马祖杜勒斯说，美国“不赞成把这些岛屿交给中国共产党人”，他甚至公然说，“即使中华民国（指蒋介石集团）同意。”美国也“不愿意”。这就再也清楚不过地说明了，美国决心要直接控制这些中国内海的岛屿作为随时可以动用的侵略中国大陆的跳板。同时，杜勒斯自己还揭穿了美国所谓减少驻金门的蒋介石军队的计划的含意。他说，减少金门蒋军纯粹是一个“军队部署问题”，而“军队部署问题完全是如何能够最有效地和最有力地使用现有军队的问题”。他说，这种军事布署是为了“有更大的灵活性，而且具有更广泛的行动范围，而且一旦需要的时候他们还可以回到金门去”。这就完全暴露了美国阴谋扩大对中国的侵略的野心。
    杜勒斯的谈话在许多地方涉及美国同台湾蒋介石集团的关系，台北消息表明，美国按照它自己的利益行事，已经引起台湾当局的恐慌和不满。杜勒斯的这些谈话正是在这种背景下发表的。杜勒斯说，“过去美国倾向于认为，那里的军队太多了，超过了形势的需要，而这个意见我们仍然保持着。但是中华民国（即蒋介石集团）保持着它的意见。”他承认，美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊去台北是同蒋介石集团“讨论如何能够最有效地部署中华民国的军队”，麦克耳罗伊打算要蒋介石答应减少金门军队而由美国增加那里的火力作为交换条件。
    由于害怕进一步激怒蒋介石集团，杜勒斯故意遮遮掩掩不敢公开披露真象。他故作姿态地说，减少金门军队“主要是一个要由中华民国（蒋介石集团）来决定的问题”，“我不愿意给人们留下这样的印象：我们正在力促或者打算力促中华民国（台湾蒋介石集团）违背它自己的更高明的判断而采取某种行动。”
    在谈到他上次9月30日记者招待会上关于蒋介石集团“重返大陆”已经无望的谈话的影响时，杜勒斯透露了美国的担心说：“我想人们必须很谨慎，不要说什么会使台湾作出错误解释的话，然而很容易发生这样的事。”
    杜勒斯在答复记者提出的问题时承认，虽然美国并非不想把台湾问题提交联合国和国际法院以便利用联合国来干涉中国内政，但是由于中国人民坚决反对，世界舆论也并不支持美国，因此这种阴谋很难实现。
    由于美国在台湾和沿海岛屿问题上的玩火政策已经在美国国内引起一片责难，在即将到来的美国国会选举中给共和党造成极其不利的形势，杜勒斯呼吁不要在竞选运动中为外交政策争吵。他说：“在竞选运动中提出外交政策当前的一些方面是不明智的。”他希望民主党和共和党“双方会在辩论的这个方面冷静下来”。他承认他曾同艾森豪威尔和内阁人员共同商讨，“设法”阻止在竞选辩论中谈论外交政策问题。
