Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its plenary session on the 2nd. The head of the Soviet delegation, Foreign Minister Gromyko, delivered a speech at the afternoon session on the issue of the speedy withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

The head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that the current international situation is extremely tense and fraught with the danger of a serious military explosion that could plunge humanity into the abyss of a destructive atomic war.

Gromyko then pointed out that the issue of the withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan, as raised by the Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, has not been resolved. Although there has been much clamoring that US and British troops are about to withdraw, they remain stationed in these countries. This means that the threat to the Near and Middle East region posed by US-British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has not been eliminated in the slightest. The Soviet representative pointed out that the Secretary-General of the United Nations' report on this issue proves that there is no room for complacency because the United States and Great Britain have not fulfilled the obligations placed upon them by the General Assembly.

Gromyko exposed the conspiracy of the United States and Great Britain, who are employing various tricks to delay the withdrawal of troops and are grossly and unreasonably interfering in the internal affairs of Lebanon and Jordan. Gromyko said that since the Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly, there has been ample time, and if the United States and Great Britain truly valued the United Nations Organization, they would not only have been able to begin withdrawing their troops from Lebanon and Jordan but also to complete such a withdrawal. Gromyko emphasized that the various arguments put forward by the United States and Great Britain to justify their policy of interference and their delaying tactics are absurd.

Gromyko pointed out that any attempt to delay the completion of the task of the rapid withdrawal of US and British troops from Lebanon and Jordan is a serious violation of the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions. Gromyko said that the position of the United States and Great Britain on this issue gives every reason to demand that the issue of troop withdrawal, that is, the elimination of the consequences of US-British aggression against the Near East, be included as a separate item on the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. Representatives from Yugoslavia, Cuba, Bolivia, and Peru spoke at the morning session on the 2nd.

Yugoslav Federal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Popovic, when talking about the situation in the Far East, said that Taiwan and the islands of the Taiwan Strait are part of Chinese territory, and no one can deny this fact. He said, "We believe that the reason for the sharpening of the situation in this region is mainly because the People's Republic of China has not yet been given its legitimate seat in the United Nations."

Popovic said that his delegation would support partial measures on disarmament, especially measures to reduce military spending and stop nuclear testing. The Yugoslav representative advocated that disarmament negotiations should be conducted primarily within the framework of the United Nations.

In his speech, Popovic also defended Yugoslavia's so-called "active coexistence" policy. He said, with ulterior motives, that "the main source of the difficulties that Yugoslavia encounters in its relations with certain countries" lies in "those countries that attempt to divide the world into two camps."

The Cuban representative, as in the past, made the most despicable slanders against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries. This representative of the bloody Batista dictatorship called on the "Western world" to launch a crusade against communism.

The Bolivian representative attempted to defend the economic enslavement of Latin America by the United States, insisting that the "economic aggression" threatening his country came from the Soviet Union.

The representative of Peru emphasized in his speech that the issue of expanding the scope of territorial waters must be resolved. He said that for countries like Peru (whose prosperity depends to a considerable extent on aquatic products), a three-nautical-mile wide area is completely unacceptable.

    葛罗米柯在联大就中东问题发言中指出
    联大决议不容蔑视　美英必须立即撤军
    大会应把消除美英对中东侵略后果问题列入议程
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会2日继续举行全体会议。苏联代表团团长、外交部部长葛罗米柯在下午的会议上就关于必须从黎巴嫩和约旦尽速撤退美英军队问题发表了演说。
    苏联代表团团长指出，当前国际局势极为紧张，并蕴藏着严重的军事性爆炸的危险，这种军事性爆炸会把人类推入破坏性原子战争的深渊。
    葛罗米柯接着指出，大会紧急特别会议所提出的从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退美英军队的问题并没有解决。虽然有人大声叫喊，说美英军队就要撤退，然而美英军队仍然留驻这些国家。这意味着，由于美英侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而形成的对中近东地区的威胁丝毫没有消除。苏联代表指出，联合国秘书长关于这个问题的报告证明，根本没有自慰的余地，因为美国和英国没有履行大会加于它们的义务。
    葛罗米柯揭露美国和英国的阴谋，美国和英国玩弄种种手腕，迟迟不撤退军队，粗暴无理地干涉黎巴嫩和约旦的内政。葛罗米柯说，自从联大紧急特别会议到现在，时间是十分充裕的，如果美英两国真正重视联合国组织的话，它们不仅能够开始从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退自己的军队，而且能够完成这种撤退。葛罗米柯着重指出，美国和英国为了给它们的干涉政策和它们采取的拖延策略辩解而提出的种种论据是荒谬的。
    葛罗米柯指出，任何企图拖延完成美英军队迅速从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出这一任务的作法都是严重违背联合国大会的决议的。葛罗米柯说，美国和英国在这个问题上的立场使人完全有理由要求把撤军问题，也就是把消除美英对近东的侵略的后果的问题作为一项单独的问题列入本届大会议程。在2日上午会议上发言的有南斯拉夫、古巴、玻利维亚和秘鲁等国代表。
    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国外交国务秘书波波维奇在谈到远东局势时说，台湾和台湾海峡岛屿是中国领土的一部分，谁也不能否认这个事实。他说，我们认为，引起这一地区局势尖锐化的原因，主要是由于到目前为止还没有让中华人民共和国在联合国中占有合法席位。
    波波维奇说，他的代表团将支持关于裁军的局部措施，特别是缩减军事开支及停止核试验的措施。南斯拉夫代表主张裁军谈判基本上在联合国范围内进行。
    波波维奇在发言中还为南斯拉夫的所谓“积极共处”政策辩护。他别有用心地硬说南斯拉夫“在同某些国家的关系方面遇到的困难的主要根源”，是在于“那些企图把世界分为两个阵营的国家”。
    古巴代表在发言中同过去一样对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家进行了最卑鄙的诽谤。这个巴蒂斯塔血腥独裁统治的代表要“西方世界”对共产主义进行十字军讨伐。
    玻利维亚代表企图为美国对拉丁美洲的经济奴役辩护，他硬说，威胁着他的国家的“经济侵略”来自苏联。
    秘鲁代表的发言中着重指出，必须解决关于扩大领海范围的问题。他说，像秘鲁这样的一些国家（它们的富裕在相当程度上取决于水产品），三海里宽的地区是完全不能接受的。
