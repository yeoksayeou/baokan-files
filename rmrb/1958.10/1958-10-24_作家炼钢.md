    Writers Smelt Steel

    On the 22nd, in an ordinary courtyard in the Dongcheng District of Beijing, groups of people were happily working from midnight to dusk. These were poets, writers, foreign literature researchers, literary editors, and literary organization staff from the capital, participating in steel smelting production organized by the Chinese Writers Association. Among them were Shao Quanlin, Liu Baiyu, Zhou Libo, Zhang Tianyi, Cao Yu, Ai Wu, Zhang Guangnian, Hou Jinjing, Yan Wenjing, Zang Kejia, Chen Baichen, Chen Bochui, Lou Shiyi, Jin Ren, Ru Long, and many editors from "Wenyi Bao" ("Literature and Art Gazette"), "Renmin Wenxue" ("People's Literature"), "Shikan" ("Poetry Journal"), "Yiwen" ("Translation"), "Xin Guancha" ("New Observer"), and the Writers Publishing House. From midnight to 7:00 PM on the 22nd, they had already smelted 1,056 jin (approximately 528 kg) of steel in this courtyard using three methods: crucible, low-temperature furnace steelmaking, and reverberatory furnace steelmaking. One batch of high-carbon steel smelted in a crucible was produced by Shao Quanlin, Liu Baiyu, and others.

    In order to respond to the Party Central Committee's call for nationwide steel smelting and to better train and transform themselves through labor, the Chinese Writers Association began organizing literary workers to smelt steel on the 10th of this month. To master steel smelting techniques, the Party General Branch of the Chinese Writers Association sent Deputy Secretary Zhang Xi to lead a seven-person team to the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Culture to visit and learn basic knowledge about steel smelting. With the help of the Dongcheng District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Beijing, they began building their own furnaces and smelting steel themselves. After more than ten days of hard work day and night, and after several failures, by 7:00 PM on the 22nd, they had successively smelted 1,863 jin (approximately 931.5 kg) of steel, including two batches of high-carbon steel with a carbon content of 0.86%. In the past few days, they have been striving to maintain a daily steel output of 1,000 jin (approximately 500 kg) and are also preparing to engage in converter steelmaking.

    作家炼钢
    22日，在北京东城区的一个普通的庭院里，从午夜到黄昏，都有一群群人在欢笑地劳动着。这是首都的诗人、作家、外国文学研究者、文学编辑工作者、文学团体工作人员们在参加中国作家协会所组织的炼钢生产。他们中间有邵荃麟、刘白羽、周立波、张天翼、曹禺、艾芜、张光年、侯金镜、严文井、臧克家、陈白尘、陈伯吹、楼适夷、金人、汝龙等人，还有“文艺报”、“人民文学”、“诗刊”、“译文”、“新观察”和作家出版社的许多编辑工作者。他们从22日零时到下午七时，已在这个院子里用坩锅、低温炉炒钢、反射炉炒钢等三种办法炼出了一千零五十六斤钢。其中一炉用坩锅炼出的高炭钢是由邵荃麟、刘白羽等炼出来的。
    中国作家协会为了响应党中央的全民炼钢的号召，更好地在劳动中锻炼、改造自己，从本月10日就开始组织文学工作者炼钢。为了掌握炼钢技术，中共作协党总支曾派副书记张僖带领一个七人小组到中宣部、文化部参观炼钢学习了有关炼钢的基本知识，在中共北京东城区委会的帮助下开始自己砌炉，自己炼钢。经过十多天的昼夜苦战，也经过几次的失败，到22日下午七时，他们已经先后炼出了一千八百六十三斤钢，其中有两炉是含炭量0.86％的高炭钢。最近几天，他们要争取每天保持产钢千斤，还准备搞转炉炼钢。
