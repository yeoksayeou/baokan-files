Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. The Soviet people are greeting the great 41st anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with unprecedented enthusiasm. Whether in factories, mines, collective farms, or construction sites, a new upsurge of socialist labor emulation has been launched everywhere. Everyone is striving to present significant labor achievements as gifts to these two major events.

In recent days, various economic regions have successively reported the early completion of the ten-month production plan. Enterprises in the Moscow Economic Zone completed the ten-month plan for total output and many important products ahead of schedule on the 20th. The automotive industry sector of this economic zone, due to the labor emulation launched to greet the October Revolution Day, completed the ten-month production plan half a month ahead of schedule.

The Latvian Economic Zone completed the first ten months' plan ahead of schedule this year, with a total output increase of over 11% compared to the same period last year. The machine-building workers of the Almaty Economic Zone completed the fourth-quarter orders for metallurgical equipment for China, North Korea, and Romania ahead of schedule.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced ninety-four slogans on October 18 to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution. The announcement of these slogans further encouraged all working people. At the symposiums to study this document, everyone expressed their determination to respond to the Party's call with practical actions.

Construction workers in Tbilisi are working hard to find ways to reduce the cost of each square meter of living space. Textile workers in Tashkent are redoubling their efforts to produce hundreds of thousands of meters of fabric for the country by saving raw materials and semi-finished products.

Soviet agricultural laborers, who have achieved a bumper harvest this year, are even more jubilantly continuing to greet the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution with even greater labor achievements. As of the 10th, state farms and collective farms across the Soviet Union had sold 1.487 billion poods of grain to the state, greatly exceeding the sales volume of 1953—a year of bumper harvest—a record never seen in history. The sales volume of meat also increased by 62% compared to the same period in 1953, and milk doubled compared to 1953. Now, agricultural laborers in Siberia and Kazakhstan are working day and night to complete the final harvest work in order to greet their great festival. Many areas that have completed the harvest are making various preparations to lay the foundation for an even greater agricultural harvest next year.

    迎接十月革命四十一周年
    苏联人民掀起劳动竞赛高潮
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联人民正在以空前高涨的热情来迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年和苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会。不论在工厂、矿山、集体农庄或建筑工地，到处都掀起了社会主义劳动竞赛的新高潮。每个人都在努力争取以显著的劳动成就作为对这两个重大日子的献礼。
    这几天来，各个经济区纷纷传来提前完成十个月生产计划的消息。莫斯科市经济区各企业在20日提前完成了总产量和许多重要产品的十个月计划。这个经济区的汽车工业部门由于展开了迎接十月革命节的劳动竞赛，提前半个月完成了十个月生产计划。
    拉脱维亚经济区今年提前完成头十个月计划，总产量比去年同时期增加了11％以上。阿拉木图经济区的机器制造工人提前完成了第四季度中国、朝鲜和罗马尼亚冶金设备的订货。
    苏共中央在10月18日公布了九十四条的庆祝十月革命四十一周年的口号。这个口号公布后，更加鼓舞了全体劳动人民。在学习这个文件的座谈会上，大家都表示要以实际行动响应党所提出的号召。
    第比利斯的建筑工人正在努力设法减低每一平方公尺居住面积的成本。塔什干的纺织工人正在加倍努力用节约原料和半成品的办法多为国家生产出几十万公尺的织物。
    今年获得大丰收的苏联农业劳动者更是欢欣鼓舞地继续以更大的劳动成就来迎接十月革命四十一周年。到10日止，全苏联的国营农场和集体农庄已向国家交售了十四亿八千七百万普特粮食，大大超过了1953年——丰收年的交售量，这是历史上从来没有过的纪录。肉类的交售量也比1953年同期多62％，牛奶比1953年增加了一倍。现在，西伯利亚和哈萨克的农业劳动者为迎接自己的伟大节日，正在夜以继日地完成最后的收割工作。许多已经完成收割工作的地区，正在作好各种准备，为明年农业更大的丰收打下基础。
