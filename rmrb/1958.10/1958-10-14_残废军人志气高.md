    Disabled Soldiers Have High Aspirations
        Selected and Edited by Jun Qian
	I
  The East Wind sweeps across ten thousand miles, red flags flutter;
    Disabled soldiers have high aspirations;
  Industry, agriculture, and sideline occupations leap forward,
    Three horses gallop, soaring into the clouds.
	II
  Heroic will is firm and steadfast,
    Disabled heroes engage in production.
  Increasing wealth for national construction,
    Throwing the "consumer" label to the side.
  Accumulating 100,000 in '58,
    Increasing forty-fold in five years.
	III
  Red flags wave, covering the sky,
    Production enthusiasm breaks through the long rainbow;
  What is there to fear from the difficulties of disability?
    Determination and willpower can swallow the clouds and wind.
  Apples are fragrant, grapes are sweet,
    Apricots are waxy yellow, peaches have rosy faces;
  Ordinary people grow delicious fruit,
    Veteran soldiers grow even more delicious fruit.

    残废军人志气高
        君谦选辑 	一
  东风万里红旗飘，
    残废军人志气高；
  工农副业大跃进，
    三马奔腾冲云霄。	二
  英雄意志坚又坚，
    残废豪杰搞生产。
  为国建设增财富，
    消费帽子扔一边。
  五八年积累十万整，
    五年翻上四十番。	三
  红旗招展遮太空，
    生产干劲破长虹；
  残废困难何所怕，
    决心毅力啖云风。
  四苹果喷香葡萄甜，
    杏儿蜡黄桃红脸；
  常人植果果味美，
    荣军植果味更鲜。
