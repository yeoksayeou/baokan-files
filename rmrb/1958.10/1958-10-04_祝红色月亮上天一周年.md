    Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Red Moon Ascending to Heaven

    It has been a year since the Soviet Union successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite into space. On this day last year, the signal of the "Red Moon" shook the world. The Soviet Union's first satellite was a landmark event, marking the beginning of mankind's conquest of the universe. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite is not a simple event, a new era of mankind's further conquest of nature has begun." In the past year, the Soviet Union has continued to launch two larger artificial Earth satellites, and to this day the Soviet Union's third satellite is still operating in the skies above the world. The three Soviet satellites have greatly encouraged the people of all countries in their struggle for peace and human progress. The Chinese people are proud of the tremendous achievements of the Soviet people in science and technology, and warmly congratulate the Soviet people on their fruitful results in conquering outer space.

    The Soviet satellite's ascent into the sky is a powerful proof of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind." Recently, former U.S. Air Force Secretary Symington even said: "The Soviet Union's first successful launch of a satellite has shattered the American claim of surpassing the Soviets in quality." Now, the world situation has undergone great changes. What is particularly important is that the economic situations of the socialist camp and the imperialist camp have developed in drastically different ways. The Soviet Union's industrial production in the first half of this year increased by 10.5% compared with the same period last year, and agriculture also achieved a bumper harvest. Our country's steel and grain production this year will both double compared to last year. Other socialist countries have also made great progress in industry and agriculture this year. In the imperialist camp, however, especially in the most developed capitalist country, the United States, a serious economic crisis has occurred. In terms of science and technology, the Soviet Union has not only launched three large satellites, but also made newer achievements in many important areas. Last December, the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker built by the Soviet Union was launched; in August this year, a geophysical rocket carrying animals was successfully launched; in September this year, the Soviet Union's second nuclear power plant also partially began generating electricity; this year, the Soviet Union also built a new type of thermonuclear reaction device—the "Ogra" device, which is an important achievement of the Soviet Union in researching the peaceful use of thermonuclear reactions. In the past year, the United States, after countless failed experiments, only launched three small satellites with very low scientific value; the United States' blind launch of "lunar satellites" without sufficient scientific and technological preparation also failed. All of these powerfully prove that the socialist camp has achieved greater and greater advantages in the peaceful competition with the capitalist camp.

    The Soviet Union's tremendous achievements in science and technology are a boon for the people of all countries in the socialist camp and for all mankind. The Soviet Union has already taken the lead in the peaceful use of atomic energy, but the Soviet Union does not intend to monopolize this extremely important achievement of human science. The Soviet Union advocates the establishment of international cooperation and is willing to conduct research jointly with nuclear physicists from all countries. As early as 1955, the Soviet Union decided to provide other socialist countries with scientific and technological and production assistance in the work of establishing scientific experiments in nuclear physics research and the peaceful use of atomic energy. In 1956, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research was established in Moscow, and the Soviet Union helped researchers from fraternal countries to carry out research in nuclear physics. At present, with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, many socialist countries have established atomic reactors; our country's first experimental atomic reactor and cyclotron have also been completed recently. In order to express the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, Soviet scientists announced to the world in Beijing in August this year the new achievements of the Soviet Union in researching the peaceful use of thermonuclear reactions—the completion of a new type of thermonuclear reaction device—the "Ogra" device. In addition, the Soviet Union has also cooperated with Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, and other countries in nuclear physics research and the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union's selfless assistance to all countries in this regard is not only of great significance for promoting the technological progress and productivity development of these countries, but also a great contribution to the cause of human science and progress. We firmly believe that the results achieved by the Soviet Union in launching satellites for extensive research on outer space will help socialist countries and other countries in their research work in this area, and encourage scientists from all countries to strive to enable mankind to conquer outer space as soon as possible.

    The Soviet Union and other socialist camp countries have always advocated using modern scientific and technological achievements for peaceful purposes, and resolutely oppose the aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism using modern scientific and technological achievements for the purposes of war and aggression. The Soviet Union has made great efforts to strive for the cessation of testing all types of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. In March this year, the Soviet Union unilaterally announced the cessation of testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, precisely for this peaceful purpose. However, the U.S. imperialists completely disregarded this effort by the Soviet Union, disregarded the peaceful aspirations of the people of the world, and took advantage of the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing to intensify their "atomic blackmail" against the people of the world, conducting about forty nuclear weapons explosions in the Pacific region and the U.S. mainland. It is very obvious that although U.S. imperialism has long been lagging behind in atomic weapons and rocket weapons, it still wants to take advantage of the Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear weapons testing to obtain unilateral maximum military advantages and carry out "atomic blackmail" against the people of all countries. Recently, when U.S. imperialism carried out military provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, it repeatedly clamored to use atomic weapons and dispatched air force units equipped with nuclear weapons to Taiwan, which is a very clear example. Under these circumstances, the Soviet government's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing is not only out of consideration for the Soviet Union's own security, but more importantly, it will be conducive to ensuring world peace and human safety. The Soviet Union's resumption of nuclear weapons testing is a serious warning to the U.S. warmongers and will encourage greater confidence and courage for the world's peace-loving people to strive for peace.

    Today, our country has entered a new era of technological revolution and cultural revolution. The technical reform movement of the broad masses of workers and peasants in our country is flourishing, and our scientific and technological personnel are fiercely attacking "cutting-edge science." Every achievement of the Soviet Union in science and technology is a great encouragement to the people of our country. We sincerely thank the Soviet Union for the fraternal assistance it has given to the people of our country in science and technology, and continue to earnestly study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, so that our country becomes a socialist country with a high level of science and technology.

    祝红色月亮上天一周年
    苏联成功地发射世界上第一个人造地球卫星上天一周年了。去年今天，“红色月亮”的讯号声震动了全世界。苏联第一个卫星上天，是一个划时代的事件，它标志着人类征服宇宙的开始。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星不是一个简单的事件，人类进一步征服自然界的新纪元从此开始了。”在过去一年中，苏联又继续发射了两个更大的人造地球卫星，至今苏联的第三个卫星还在全世界的上空运转。苏联三个卫星给予各国人民争取和平和人类进步的事业以极大的鼓舞。中国人民为苏联人民在科学技术方面所获得的巨大成就而自豪，并且热烈祝贺苏联人民在征服宇宙空间方面取得丰硕的成果。
    苏联卫星上了天，是“东风压倒西风”的有力证明。最近美国前空军部长薛明顿还在说：“苏联第一次成功地发射卫星，使美国的以优质胜过苏联人的说法告吹了。”现在，世界形势又有了很大的变化。特别重要的是，社会主义阵营同帝国主义阵营的经济情况发生了截然不同的发展。苏联今年上半年的工业生产比去年同期增加了10.5％，农业也获得丰收。我国今年钢和粮食生产都将比去年增产一倍。其他社会主义国家今年在工业和农业方面也有很大的发展。而在帝国主义阵营，首先是在资本主义最发达的美国，却发生了严重的经济危机。在科学技术方面，苏联不仅发射了三个大卫星，而且在许多重要的方面都有了更新的成就。去年12月，苏联建造的世界上第一艘原子破冰船下了水；今年8月，又成功地发射了载有动物的一级地球物理火箭；今年9月，苏联第二个原子能发电站也部分开始发电；今年苏联还建成了新型热核反应装置——“奥格拉”装置，这是苏联在研究和平利用热核反应方面的重要成果。而美国在过去一年中，在无数次的试验失败中，才发射出三个科学价值很低的小卫星；美国在没有足够的科学技术准备的情况下，盲目发射“月球卫星”也遭到了失败。所有这些，都有力地证明了社会主义阵营在同资本主义阵营进行的和平竞赛中，已经取得了越来越大的优势。
    苏联在科学技术方面的巨大成就，是社会主义阵营各国人民的福音，是全人类的福音。苏联在和平利用原子能方面，已经走在全世界的前头，可是苏联并没有打算垄断这个人类科学上极重要的成果。苏联主张建立国际合作，愿意同一切国家的核子物理学家共同进行研究。早在1955年，苏联就决定在建立核子物理研究与和平利用原子能的科学实验工作中，给予其他社会主义国家以科学技术方面和生产方面的援助。1956年又在莫斯科成立了联合核子研究所，苏联帮助各兄弟国家的研究人员进行核子物理方面的研究。目前，在苏联的大力援助下，许多社会主义国家已经建立了原子反应堆；我国第一个实验性原子反应堆和回旋加速器也已经在最近建成。苏联科学家为了表示中苏两国人民的深厚友谊，今年8月在北京向全世界宣布苏联研究和平利用热核反应的新成果——建成新型热核反应装置——“奥格拉”装置。此外，苏联还同印度尼西亚、阿联等国在核子物理研究与和平利用原子能方面进行了合作。苏联在这方面给予各国的无私的援助，不仅对促进这些国家的技术进步和生产力发展有重大的意义，而且是对人类科学和进步事业的巨大贡献。我们深信，苏联在发射卫星对宇宙空间进行广泛研究方面所取得的成果，将有助于社会主义各国和其他国家在这方面的研究工作，鼓舞各国科学家为使人类早日征服宇宙空间而努力。
    苏联和其他社会主义阵营国家一向主张把现代科学技术成就用于和平目的，坚决反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团把现代科学技术成就用于战争和侵略的目的。苏联为争取停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器，曾经作了很大的努力。苏联在今年3月间，单方面宣布停止试验原子武器和氢武器，就是为了这个和平的目的。可是，美帝国主义者完全无视苏联这种努力，无视世界人民的和平愿望，趁苏联单方面停止试验核武器的时候，变本加厉地向世界各国人民进行“原子讹诈”，在太平洋地区和美国本土进行了四十次左右的核武器爆炸。很明显，虽然美帝国主义在原子武器和火箭武器方面早已落后了，然而它仍然想利用苏联停止试验核武器的机会，来取得单方面的最大限度的军事优势，向各国人民进行“原子讹诈”。最近，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区向我国进行军事挑衅时，一再叫嚣要使用原子武器，并向台湾派遣配备有核武器的空军部队，就是很显明的例子。在这种情况下，苏联政府决定恢复核武器试验，这不仅是出于苏联自身安全的考虑，更重要的是将有利于保障世界的和平和人类安全。苏联恢复核武器试验，对美国好战分子是一个严重的警告，并且将鼓舞全世界爱好和平人民争取和平斗争的更大信心和勇气。
    今天，我国已进入技术革命和文化革命的新时代。我国广大工农群众的技术改革运动正在蓬勃发展，我国科学技术人员正在猛攻“尖端科学”。苏联在科学技术方面的每一个成就，都是对我国人民的巨大鼓舞。我们衷心感谢苏联在科学技术方面给予我国人民的兄弟般的援助，并且继续认真地学习苏联先进的科学技术，使我国成为一个有高度科学技术水平的社会主义国家。
