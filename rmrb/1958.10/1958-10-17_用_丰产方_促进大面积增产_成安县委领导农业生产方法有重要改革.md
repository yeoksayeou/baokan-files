Using "High-Yield Blocks" to Promote Large-Scale Production Increase
Cheng'an County Party Committee Leads Important Reform in Agricultural Production Methods

(Our Newspaper News) The Cheng'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province has combined experimental fields and high-yield fields to form large-scale "high-yield blocks" for the same crop. This is an important reform in the leadership of agricultural production. This experience has yielded significant results in cotton production this year and will be further applied to grain, oil, and other production.

This year, Cheng'an County planted 340,000 mu of cotton. Preliminary estimates put the average yield at at least 290 jin of ginned cotton per mu. With further management and careful harvesting, achieving 300 jin is highly likely. This represents an increase of more than threefold compared to the bumper year of 1957. Recently, cotton has universally started to bloom. The results of the first picking show that an average of more than 150 jin of seed cotton per mu has been harvested. The yield of the first bloom alone has already surpassed the entire annual yield per mu last year. Not only has a universal bumper harvest been achieved, but also many high-yield "satellites" have emerged. Preliminary statistics show that the county has 5,400 mu with a yield of 600 to 1200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

The fundamental reason for the universal bumper harvest of cotton this year is that the County Party Committee consistently implemented the "three-in-one" principle of "high-yield as a model, large-scale high-yield as the backbone, and overall production increase as the goal" from beginning to end. On the basis of vigorously developing experimental fields, farmers throughout the county further combined experimental fields and high-yield fields, using the new form of "high-yield blocks" to promote a large-scale high-yield campaign throughout the county.

"High-yield blocks" are a product of the great leap forward situation, a new development in the mass experimental field movement of the entire party and the entire people, and also an important reform in agricultural production leadership methods. In the early stage of the Great Leap Forward movement this year, although the mass high-yield movement has been further developed. However, the bias of grasping satellite fields and neglecting large-scale high-yield and universal production increase has not been truly resolved. Due to the existence of contradictions such as scattered experimental field plots, unconcentrated leadership, and incoordination between individual experiments and team farm work, the universal high-yield movement failed to take off. In this situation, the Daodongbao Township Party Committee proposed a plan to connect scattered small experimental fields and high-yield lands into large "high-yield blocks". They planned the land of six communities including Daodongbao, Qucun, and Xinan Village together, fixed labor, unified measures, unified actions, assigned responsibilities by section, and determined it as a ten-thousand-mu thousand-jin block. After discovering this situation, the County Party Committee believed that this approach could not only establish a model but also effectively promote universal high-yield and combine production, technology, and culture. Therefore, it decided to promote this leadership experience throughout the county. Following this, many "high-yield roads" and "high-yield blocks" appeared. The "high-yield road" of Xucun Commune reached fifteen li in length. The cotton in these "blocks" and "roads" was truly uniformly green, uniformly tall, and uniformly robust. Especially after the Xucun on-site meeting, the townships and communes built as they worked, and the mass "high-yield block" movement rapidly grew and expanded throughout the county. In the end, a total of one hundred "high-yield blocks" and twenty "high-yield roads" appeared throughout the county. The cotton fields of the "high-yield blocks" reached more than 150,000 mu. On this basis, many "high-yield blocks" not only engaged in production but also added many new contents. The "high-yield block" of the Zhanghedian Alliance Commune established a Leap Forward shed, established a Red and Expert school, conducted political, technical, and cultural studies, and established a canteen and club. They took the "block" as the center of people's activities. As the cadres who visited from other places gave them four lines of advice: entering the "high-yield block" is like a small farm, men and women are busy with production, and everywhere is full of joy.

This year's practice has proven that vigorously developing "high-yield blocks" has at least the following five benefits:

First, "high-yield blocks" are a concrete manifestation of implementing the County Party Committee's proposed policy of "high-yield as a model, large-scale high-yield as the backbone, and overall production increase as the goal." It can combine cadre experimental fields with large-scale high-yield, further drive the development of the high-yield movement, and effectively overcome the phenomenon of satellite fields, high-yield fields, and universal production increase being disconnected. This year, the average yield of ginned cotton in the 150,000 mu of "high-yield blocks" was 350 jin per mu. Although the area only accounted for 44% of the total cotton planting area, the output accounted for 62% of the total output.

A comparison of the two communes further illustrates this situation. Last year, Xin Village Commune of Donghe Township had a yield of 182 jin of seed cotton per mu. This year, it did not establish a "block," and the increase in production was relatively small. It is estimated that it will produce 374 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 106% over last year. However, Guoqing Commune of Daodongbao Township had a yield of 126 jin of seed cotton per mu last year. This year, it established a "high-yield block," and the yield per mu is estimated to be 655 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 420% over last year. The growth rate of the two communes differs by about three times.

Second, since "high-yield blocks" are set up according to crops, they can specialize labor, fix labor, concentrate leadership, clarify responsibilities, specify measures, and ensure various operating requirements. In the past, the County Party Committee also proposed carrying out a large-scale high-yield movement, but because the leadership was not concentrated, the labor was not fixed, and the measures were not specific, it did not achieve good results. This year, with the determination of "high-yield blocks", the leadership and labor can be fixed, and specific production increase measures can be proposed according to the "block." This overcomes the phenomenon of excessive labor mobility and the failure to implement plans and measures.

Third, the establishment and implementation of specialized management of "high-yield blocks" themselves play a role in inter-competition. Therefore, it further encourages cadres and the masses to learn from advanced experiences and catch up with advanced levels, changing the face of backward teams inside the "block" and backward teams outside the "block." After the establishment of the "block," many township and commune cadres automatically visited, secretly increased their efforts, automatically merged "blocks," established specialized organizations, and regularly conducted inspections and evaluations, quickly setting off a high-yield competition movement. Like the backward Huadian Village, which had never grown good crops in the past, this year cotton, grain, and various other crops have all reached the first category.

Fourth, vigorously developing "high-yield blocks" is adapted to the development of reducing planting area and increasing yield per unit area under the conditions of communization. With "high-yield blocks," planting area can be reduced, and part of the land can be freed up to develop forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and other production in a planned manner, and agricultural basic construction such as gardenification and river network can be accelerated.

Fifth, with large-scale "high-yield blocks," a technical revolution is required, and learning culture and science will inevitably become the urgent need of the broad masses. All "blocks" or "roads" in the county combine science, culture, and production to varying degrees. The "high-yield blocks" promoted a climax of community members studying technology and culture. In turn, the improvement of cultural and technical level promoted the development of production. The "high-yield block" of Zhanghedian, because of their good combination of production, culture, and technology, all cadres and community members felt comfortable, and everyone's enthusiasm for production and learning was high.

In short, vigorously developing high-yield blocks is completely in line with the objective development needs of large-scale production, and it is also the urgent demand of the broad masses of community members after the people's commune.

In order to have a greater leap forward in 1959, the Cheng'an County Party Committee is continuing to implement the established policy of high-yield as a model, large-scale high-yield as the backbone, and overall production increase as the goal, based on the spirit of centering on a large increase in cotton, grain, and oil, and correspondingly developing forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries in an all-round way. In 1959, it is planned to plant 350,000 mu of cotton, requiring a yield of 600 jin of ginned cotton per mu, striving for 1,000 jin; 200,000 mu of grain crops, guaranteeing a yield of 3,000 jin per mu, striving for 5,000 jin; and 30,000 mu of oil crops, with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu. The County Party Committee believes that with the extremely superior conditions of the people's commune, all crops in the county will be planted in "blocks" next year, and special management will be implemented according to the "blocks." First, we will start with planting wheat to carry out planting in "blocks." In the autumn and winter, in conjunction with the production plan of the People's Commune, we will immediately plan comprehensively, and all kinds of crops in the county will be planted according to regionalization, and professional management will be implemented, so that agricultural production will show a new face.

### 用“丰产方”促进大面积增产  成安县委领导农业生产方法有重要改革

    用“丰产方”促进大面积增产
    成安县委领导农业生产方法有重要改革
    本报讯　中共河北省成安县委把试验田和丰产田结合起来，组成同一作物的大面积“丰产方”，是领导农业生产方法上的一个重要改革。这个经验今年已在棉花生产上收到显著成效，并将进一步运用到粮食、油料等生产上去。
    成安县今年种棉三十四万亩，初步估产平均亩产至少二百九十斤皮棉，再经过后期管理和精收细摘，实现三百斤也大有可能，这与丰收的1957年对比起来增产三倍以上。最近棉花普遍开絮，第一遍摘的结果，平均每亩摘籽棉一百五十斤以上，头一喷花已抵住去年全年的亩产量。不但获得普遍丰收，而且还出现了许多高产卫星，初步统计全县有五千四百亩，亩产皮棉可达到六百斤至一千二百斤以上。
    今年棉花普遍实现丰收的根本原因：是县委自始至终贯彻了“以高额丰产为样板、大面丰产为骨干、全面增产为目的”的三位一体的方针。全县农民在大搞试验田的基础上，进一步把试验田与丰产田结合起来，用“丰产方”这一新的形式，推动全县范围内的大面积丰产运动。
    “丰产方”是生产大跃进形势下的产物，是全党全民大搞试验田运动的新发展，也是农业生产领导方法上的一项重要改革。在今年大跃进运动的初期，虽然群众丰产运动有了进一步开展。但是抓住卫星田，忽视大面积丰产和普遍增产的偏向还没有真正解决。由于存在试验田地块分散，领导不集中，个人试验与队内农活不调和等矛盾，普遍丰产运动未能开展起来。在这种情况下，道东堡乡党委提出把零星的小块试验田和丰产地连成大块“丰产方”的计划。他们将道东堡、曲村、西南庄等六个社的土地规划在一起，固定劳力，统一措施，统一行动，分段负责，确定为万亩千斤方。县委发现这个情况后，认为这样作既能树立典型，又能有效的推动普遍的丰产，并能使生产、技术、文化结合起来。因此，决定在全县推广这一领导经验。跟着出现了许多“丰产路”“丰产方”。徐村社“丰产路”达十五里地长。这些“方”与“路”的棉花真是青一色、高一头、大一膀。特别是经过徐村现场会议后，各乡、社一边建一边干，大搞“丰产方”运动在全县范围内迅速的成长壮大起来，最后全县共出现了一百个“丰产方”，二十条“丰产路”。“丰产方”的棉田达到十五万亩以上。在这一基础上，许多“丰产方”不仅搞生产，还添了许多新的内容。漳河店联盟社的“丰产方”，设立了跃进棚，建立了红专学校，进行政治、技术、文化学习，建立了食堂、俱乐部。他们把“方”作为人们的活动中心。正如外地参观的干部给他们的四句赠言：进了“丰产方”，好比小农庄，男女生产忙，到处喜洋洋。
    今年实践证明大搞“丰产方”至少有以下五个好处：
    第一、“丰产方”是贯彻执行县委提出的以“高额丰产为样板、大面丰产为骨干、全面增产为目的”的方针的具体化，它可以把干部试验田和大面积的丰产结合起来，进一步带动丰产运动的开展，有效地克服了卫星田、丰产田与普遍增产脱节的现象。今年在十五万亩“丰产方”中平均亩产三百五十斤皮棉。虽然面积仅占总植棉亩数的44％，但产量却占总产量的62％。
    再从两个社的对比来看，更能显明说明这个情况。东河乡一心社去年亩产籽棉一百八十二斤，今年没有搞“方”，增产较少，估计产籽棉三百七十四斤，比去年增产106％。而道东堡乡国庆社去年亩产籽棉一百二十六斤，今年搞了“丰产方”，亩产量估计可产籽棉六百五十五斤，比去年增产420％。这两个社的增产速度相差三倍左右。
    第二、由于“丰产方”是按作物设置的，它可以使劳力专业化，劳力固定，领导力量集中，责任明确，措施具体，各项操作要求都有了保证。过去县委也提过开展大面积丰产运动，但因为领导力量不集中，劳力不固定，措施不具体，没有收到很好的效果。今年确定了“丰产方”，可以把领导力量、劳力固定下来，并且按“方”提出具体增产措施，这样就克服了劳力流动性过大，计划、措施不落实的现象。
    第三、“丰产方”建立和实行专业化管理，它本身就起着相互间竞赛的作用。因此进一步鼓舞干部、群众学先进、赶先进的积极性，改变了“方”内落后队和“方”外落后队的面貌。建“方”后，不少乡、社干部自动参观，暗地加劲，自动并“方”，建立专门组织，定期检查评比，很快地掀起一个丰产竞赛运动。像落后的化店村，过去没有长过好庄稼，今年棉花、粮食各种作物都站到了第一类。
    第四、大搞“丰产方”是适应公社化以后，在大量提高单位面积产量的条件下，向少种多收的方向发展的。有了“丰产方”可以减少种植面积，腾出一部分土地有计划地发展林业、牧业、渔业等生产，并且可以加速进行园田化、河网化等农田基本建设。
    第五、有了大面积的“丰产方”就要求来一个技术革命，学习文化、科学必然成为广大群众的迫切要求。全县各个“方”或“路”都程度不同地把科学、文化与生产结合起来。通过“丰产方”推动了社员群众学习技术、学习文化的高潮。反过来由于文化、技术水平的提高，又推动了生产的发展。漳河店“丰产方”，由于他们生产、文化、技术结合的好，干部、社员个个心情舒畅，人人生产学习情绪高涨。
    总之，大搞丰产方是完全符合大生产客观发展需要的，也是人民公社化后广大社员群众迫切要求的。
    为了在1959年再来一个更大的跃进，成安县委正本着以大量增产棉、粮、油为中心，相应地全面发展林、牧、副、渔业的精神，继续贯彻以高额丰产为样板，大面丰产为骨干，全面增产为目的的既定方针。1959年计划种棉三十五万亩，要求亩产皮棉六百斤，争取一千斤；粮食作物二十万亩，保证亩产三千斤，争取五千斤；油料作物三万亩，亩产三千斤。县委认为有了人民公社这样一个极其优越条件，明年全县各种作物全部划“方”种植，按“方”实行专责管理，首先从种麦开始进行划“方”种植。秋、冬季结合人民公社的生产规划，立即全面规划，全县各种作物按照区域化进行种植，实行专业管理，使农业生产出现一个新的面貌。
