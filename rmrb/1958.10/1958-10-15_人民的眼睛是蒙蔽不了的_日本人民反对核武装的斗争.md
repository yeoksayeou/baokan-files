    The Eyes of the People Cannot Be Deceived
    ——The Japanese People's Struggle Against Nuclear Armament

    "Merchants of Death" Lurking in the Shadows
    Every night, in the dazzling and decadent Tokyo, a group of "gentlemen" indulge in extravagant pleasures in nightclubs and bars, spending money like water. Among them, the American "merchants of death" are the biggest spenders. Mixed in with them are high-ranking officials from the Japanese government's Defense Agency, militarists who control the Liberal Democratic Party's National Defense Committee, and the Japanese arms importers and manufacturers who gather around them. The American "merchants of death" are vying to buy off Japanese "gentlemen," peddling outdated American nuclear weapons and aircraft. The Japanese "merchants of death" are also engaged in open and covert struggles to win contracting rights. According to recent disclosures in Japanese newspapers, the Japanese government has decided to spend 100 billion yen from the national treasury to order 300 fighter jets from the United States, but the Defense Agency and the "powerful figures" of the Liberal Democratic Party have quarreled over which company and which model to choose. It is said that this farce is about to be brought to the Diet.
    Japanese Government Hiding its Head and Showing its Tail
    On June 16th of this year, the Soviet government sent a second note to the Japanese government regarding the issue of atomic bases on Japanese territory. In its reply on August 23rd, the Japanese government flatly denied this, saying that the Soviet government's accusations were "groundless." However, only four days later, on August 27th, the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee meeting held in Tokyo discussed the "modernization of equipment" of the Self-Defense Forces and the acceptance of American "aid." The next day, the Japanese Defense Agency publicly announced its 1959 defense plan, which centered on strengthening the missile equipment of the Self-Defense Forces, establishing a new "missile testing unit" for the Ground Self-Defense Force, and continuing to purchase "Sidewinder" missiles to equip the Air Self-Defense Force. The Liberal Democratic Party's National Defense Committee meeting, held on the same day, believed that in order to research and develop new weapons such as missiles, it was necessary to implement a "counter-espionage law" and prepared to submit a "counter-espionage bill" to the Diet. The Japanese government had already implemented the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement Secret Protection Law in 1954 (violators would be sentenced to up to ten years in prison). However, the United States was not satisfied with this and demanded that the Japanese government implement a "counter-espionage law" as the price for the United States providing nuclear weapons to Japan. Obviously, its purpose is to deprive the Japanese people of the right to discuss any issue, just as in the Tojo era.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government is playing a double game, deceiving the Japanese people on the one hand by saying that it also opposes bringing nuclear weapons into Japan; on the other hand, it turns a deaf ear to the fact that the United States has already brought nuclear weapons into Japan, saying that it has no right to stop it; at the same time, it is actively demanding that the United States provide missiles to Japan, preparing to equip the Japanese Self-Defense Forces with nuclear weapons. This kind of head-in-the-sand behavior cannot deceive the Japanese people in the slightest. At the Fourth World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament, Japanese representatives fully exposed the situation of Japan's nuclear armament and determined the direction of the struggle against nuclear armament.
    Atomic Bases All Over Japan
    Under the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of "strengthening Japan-U.S. cooperation," Japan is stepping up its involvement in the U.S. atomic strategy system, and the whole of Japan has become a U.S. atomic base.

    The U.S. Seventh Fleet, stationed at the Sasebo naval port, possesses nuclear weapons. The commander of this fleet clamors that he can use atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs for attacks at any time.

    The U.S. Naval Aviation Force stationed at the Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi Prefecture had a squadron entirely composed of A4D "Skyhawk" aircraft a year ago. These "Skyhawks" carry atomic bombs and patrol the skies over Japan all day long. At Itazuke Airport in northern Kyushu, there are also F100 aircraft that can carry atomic bombs.

    It is no longer a secret that the U.S. "Honest John" missiles have been transported into Japan. Now, the U.S. Fifth Air Force Headquarters at Yokota Base near Tokyo is preparing to transport in "Nike" II surface-to-air missiles, and plans to transport in medium-range ballistic missiles in the future, and has expanded the base for this purpose.

    As for Okinawa, which is occupied by the United States, atomic war preparations are being carried out even more hysterically. The United States is building eight "Nike" surface-to-air missile bases in Okinawa, and 80% of the aircraft taking off from Okinawa can carry atomic bombs. In particular, the two major air force bases of Kadena and Naha have heavy jet bombers and various aircraft that can carry atomic bombs. This May, "Thor" medium-range ballistic missiles were transported into Okinawa.

    Under the atomic strategy system, the importance of ground forces has been greatly reduced, so almost all U.S. ground forces stationed in Japan were withdrawn last year. But on the other hand, U.S. air force bases such as Misawa, Johnson, Itazuke, Atsugi, and Yokota are strengthening nuclear armament (missileization). The U.S. naval bases at Yokosuka and Sasebo have also been greatly strengthened.

    For several years, the U.S. military has been trying to expand the Tachikawa Air Force Base. Due to the fierce opposition of the Japanese people, the plan to forcibly requisition land in Sunagawa Town to expand this base has not been realized to this day. But the U.S. military has not abandoned this plan, and is now reapplying pressure, trying to realize its plan.
    Nuclear Armament of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces
    The Japanese Self-Defense Forces currently have 170,000 in the army, 991 aircraft in the air force, and 124,000 tons of warships, with a total firepower six times that of the pre-war Japanese army. Now, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces are starting to equip themselves with missiles. The Ground Self-Defense Force has opened a school in Omiya near Tokyo, specializing in training atomic warfare skills, and also conducting research on germ warfare. The Ground Self-Defense Force is also preparing to establish a missile testing unit starting next year.

    The Air Self-Defense Force has already put the "Sidewinder" air-to-air missile into practical use with the F86F aircraft. Japan is also manufacturing the 11F aircraft, which can drop atomic bombs, and has conducted exercises for dropping atomic and hydrogen bombs in Hokkaido. The P2V anti-submarine patrol aircraft of the Maritime Self-Defense Force can also drop atomic bombs.

    During the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea, the Japanese "merchants of death," who made huge profits from the blood, established organizations such as the Keidanren Defense Production Committee, the Japan Ordnance Industry Association, the Japan Aerospace Industries Association, and the Missile Council, and colluded with the Defense Agency to start producing jet aircraft and missiles. Not only that, in order to promote the export of arms to South Korea, Taiwan, South Vietnam, and Southeast Asia, the Keidanren's Defense Production Committee is also preparing to establish a "Defense Industry Research Association," which will have various specialized departments for researching the production of aircraft, missile weapons, electronic weapons, warships, and fuels. These "merchants of death," colluding with a handful of remnants of militarism, are leading Japan down a disastrous and dangerous path of relying on U.S. warmongering forces and stepping up its involvement in the U.S. atomic strategy system.
  Japanese People Oppose Nuclear Armament
    But the Japanese people do not want to take this path. They are actively and bravely struggling against Japan's nuclear armament. Not long ago, the Yokohama dockworkers refused to unload the "Oerlikon 56" missiles purchased by the Japanese government from Switzerland, which is a clear example. Although the Kishi Nobusuke government sent the Self-Defense Forces to transport the missiles to the Yokosuka naval port, and then secretly transported the missiles from the back door to the Defense Agency's Technical Research Institute in Meguro, Tokyo, at night, it will be very difficult for the Defense Agency to find a test site for the "Oerlikon 56" missiles in Japan. Since last year, despite the various deceptive means employed by the Kishi Nobusuke government, the plan to establish a missile test site on Niijima Island in Tokyo Bay has not been realized due to the strong opposition of the local people. The second target selected as a missile test site is the North Fuji Training Area. The people of Yamanashi Prefecture also held a rally to stop the "Oerlikon" missile test, resolutely opposing the testing of missiles here.

    The Japanese people, led by the working class, are well aware that the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of nuclear armament and war policy of subordination to the United States means great disaster for the Japanese people. The prefectural assemblies of Fukuoka, Ishikawa, Shiga, and Yamanashi prefectures and the city assemblies of thirty cities have already made resolutions opposing nuclear armament, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government not establish nuclear weapon bases in Japan and not carry out nuclear armament of the Self-Defense Forces. This demand is increasingly spreading throughout the country. The World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and for Disarmament has also proposed that the Japanese Diet form an investigation team to investigate the nuclear equipment and missileization of the Self-Defense Forces and publicize the results of the investigation to the people.

    From September to November, the Japanese people's struggle against nuclear armament will merge with the struggle to defend the people's rights, uphold democracy, the struggle against the implementation of "performance appraisal," and the struggle against hostility towards China and demanding the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and develop into a national unified movement. The National Conference for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, which opened in Tokyo on October 8, is a sign that the Japanese people's struggle against nuclear armament has developed to a new stage. The Japanese people are increasingly clearly aware that the struggle against war and for peace and democracy is the struggle to safeguard their vital interests. And peace cannot be begged for; it can only be achieved through a firm struggle. (Attached picture)

    人民的眼睛是蒙蔽不了的
    ——日本人民反对核武装的斗争
    蓝海
    “死亡贩子”暗中蠢动
    每天夜里，在纸醉金迷的东京，都有一群“绅士”们在夜总会和酒吧间里，花天酒地，挥金如土。其中钱花得最凶的是美国的“死亡贩子”们。同他们搅在一起的有日本政府防卫厅的高级官僚，操纵自由民主党国防委员会的军国主义分子以及聚集在他们周围的日本军火进口商和军火制造商。美国的“死亡贩子”们正在竞相收买日本的“绅士”，兜售早已陈旧过时的美国的核武器和飞机。日本的“死亡贩子”们，也在为争夺承包权益而进行明争暗斗。据最近日本报纸揭露，日本政府决定以一千亿日元国库开支从美国订购三百架战斗机，但在选择哪个公司和哪个机种的问题上，防卫厅同自由民主党的“实力派”却发生了争吵。这幕丑剧据说已经快要闹到国会里去了。
    日本政府藏头露尾
    今年6月16日苏联政府曾就日本境内设有原子基地问题，向日本政府提出了第二次照会。日本政府在8月23日的复照中矢口否认，说什么苏联政府的指责是“缺乏根据”的。但是，事隔四日之后，即8月27日，在东京召开的日美安全委员会会议，却就自卫队三军的“装备现代化”和接受美国“援助”问题进行了协议。第二天，日本防卫厅即公然发表了以加强自卫队三军的导弹装备、新成立陆上自卫队的“导弹试验部队”、继续购置装备自卫队空军用的“响尾蛇”式导弹等为中心的1959年度防卫计划。同一天召开的自由民主党国防委员会会议认为，为了研究和发明导弹等新武器，有必要实行“防谍法”，并准备向国会提出一项“防谍法案”。日本政府早在1954年就实行了共同防卫援助协定秘密保护法（违者处以十年以下的徒刑）。但是，美国并不以此为满足，它要求日本政府实行“防谍法”作为美国向日本提供核武器的代价。显然，其目的是要像东条时代那样剥夺日本人民有谈论一切问题的权利。
    岸信介政府正在玩弄两面手法，一面欺骗日本人民说，它也反对把核武器运进日本；一面对美国已经把核武器运进日本的事实却装聋作哑，表示无权阻止；同时又积极要求美国对日本提供导弹，准备用核武器装备日本自卫队。这种藏头露尾的行径丝毫也蒙骗不了日本人民。在第四届禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会上，日本代表们就曾充分揭露了日本进行核武装的情况，并确定了反对核武装斗争的方针。
    原子基地遍布日本
    在岸信介政府“加强日美合作”的方针下，日本正在加紧卷入美国的原子战略体系，整个日本已经成为美国的原子基地。
    驻在佐世保军港的美国第七舰队拥有核武器。这个舰队的司令官，叫嚣随时都可以使用原子弹和氢弹进行攻击。
    驻在山口县岩国基地的美国海军航空部队，在一年前就有一个全是用A4D型“空中之鹰”式的飞机组成的航空中队。这些“空中之鹰”携带着原子弹整天在日本上空巡逻。在北九州的板付机场，也有可以携带原子弹的F100型飞机。
    美国的“诚实的约翰”式导弹已经运进日本，早已不是什么秘密。现在东京附近横田基地的美国第五空军司令部，正在准备运进“奈克”第二号地空导弹，将来还计划运进中程的弹道导弹，并且为此已经扩大了基地。
    至于在美国霸占着的冲绳，原子备战活动进行得就更加歇斯底里。美国正在冲绳建设八个“奈克”式地空导弹基地，从冲绳起飞的飞机，有80％是可以携带原子弹的。特别是嘉手纳、那霸两大空军基地，有重型喷气轰炸机和各种可以携带原子弹的飞机。今年5月“雷神”式中程弹道导弹已被运进了冲绳。
    在原子战略体制下，地上部队的重要性已经大大减轻，因此美国驻在日本的地上部队在去年一年内几乎全部撤走了。但是另一面，三泽、约翰逊、板付、厚木、横田等美国空军基地，却在加强核武装（导弹化）。横须贺、佐世保的美国海军基地也大大加强了。
    几年来驻日美军一直想扩大立川空军基地，由于日本人民的激烈反对，强迫征用砂川町的土地来扩大这个基地的计划迄今未能实现。但美军并没有放弃这个计划，现在又重新施加压力，极力企图实现它的计划。
  日本自卫队的核武装
    日本自卫队目前有陆军十七万，空军飞机九百九十一架，舰艇十二万四千吨，总火力为战前日军的六倍。现在日本自卫队正在着手进行导弹装备。陆上自卫队在东京附近的大宫，开设了一个学校，专门训练原子作战技能，同时还进行有关细菌战的研究。陆上自卫队还准备从明年起建立导弹试验部队。
    航空自卫队已把“响尾蛇”式空空导弹作为F86F型飞机的实战用装备。日本自己也在制造的11F型能够投掷原子弹的飞机，并且已在北海道进行投掷原子弹氢弹的演习。海上自卫队的P2V反潜水艇巡逻机，也是可以投原子弹的飞机。
    在美帝国主义侵朝战争期间，从鲜血里捞取了大批利润的日本的“死亡贩子”们，设立了经济团体联合会防卫生产委员会、日本军火工业会、日本航空工业会、导弹协议会等机构，同防卫厅勾结在一起，着手生产喷气式飞机和导弹。不仅如此，为了促进向南朝鲜、台湾、南越、东南亚输出军火，经济团体联合会的防卫生产委员会还在筹备设立一个“防卫产业研究会”，其中将设有研究飞机、导弹武器、电子武器、军舰、燃料等生产的各种专门部门。这些“死亡贩子”们和一小撮军国主义余孽勾结在一起，正在把日本引上一条依附美国好战势力、加紧卷入美国原子战略体系的充满灾难和危险的道路上去。
  日本人民反对核武装
    但是日本人民不想走这条道路。他们正在为反对日本进行核武装进行着积极而英勇的斗争。不久以前，横滨码头工人拒绝卸运日本政府从瑞士买来的“厄利康56”型导弹，就是一个明显的例子。岸信介政府虽然派出自卫队，把导弹运到横须贺军港，又从那里在深夜偷偷摸摸把导弹从后门运到了东京目黑的防卫厅技术研究所，但是，防卫厅要在日本国内寻找“厄利康56”型导弹的试射场，也将是很困难的。去年以来，尽管岸信介政府施展了各种诱骗手段，但是在东京湾外的新岛设立一个导弹试射场的计划，由于遭到当地人民的强烈反对，仍然未能实现。被选为导弹试射场的第二个目标是北富士演习场。山梨县人民也举行了制止“厄利康”型导弹试射大会，坚决反对在这里试射导弹。
    以工人阶级为首的日本人民，深知岸信介政府核武装政策和对美从属的战争政策，对于日本人民来说，意味着莫大的灾难。福冈、石川、滋贺、山梨等四县的县议会和三十个城市的市议会，已经作出了反对核武装的决议，要求岸信介政府不在日本境内建立核武器基地，不进行自卫队的核武装。这个要求正日益扩及到全国各地。禁止原子弹氢弹和争取裁军世界大会，也提议由日本国会组成调查团，就自卫队的核装备及导弹化进行调查，并向人民公布调查结果。
    从9月到11月，日本人民反对核武装的斗争，将同保卫人民权利、拥护民主的斗争，反对实行“勤务评定”的斗争，以及反对敌视中国、要求恢复中日邦交的斗争汇合起来，发展成为一个全民性的统一运动。10月8日在东京开幕的打开日中关系和禁止核武装国民大会就是日本人民反对核武装斗争发展到新阶段的一个标志。日本人民日益清楚地认识到，反对战争，争取和平民主的斗争，就是维护他们切身利益的斗争。而和平是不能乞求的，只有通过坚强的斗争才能达到这个目的。（附图片）
