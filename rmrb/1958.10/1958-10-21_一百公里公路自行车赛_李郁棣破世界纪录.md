Xinhua News Agency, 20th: At the Beijing Third People's Sports Meeting continuing today, Beijing athlete Li Yudi broke the world record for the men's 100km road cycling race with an excellent time of two hours, twelve minutes, and eighteen point nine seconds.

The previous world record was set by the Italian Bennidetti in 1942 with a time of two hours, twenty minutes, and forty-four point eight seconds, and had remained unbroken for sixteen years.

The chief referee of the Municipal Games and national referee Xia Xiang, and the deputy chief referee and national referee Li Zhou were present when the record was broken. The timing referees were national referee Liu Shiming, national referee Jin Deyao, and referee He Yitang. They used Omega double-hand stopwatches. The race was held on the Beijing-Tianjin highway.

Li Yudi is a 21-year-old Communist Party member working in the Beijing Public Security Bureau. In June of this year, he was selected as a member of the Beijing Cycling Team and began regular training. In the Beijing Second Road Cycling Championship held in mid-September this year, he achieved a time of two hours, twenty-seven minutes, and fifty-four point two seconds, reaching the Master of Sports standard.

The teams participating in today's event were strong: among the 51 athletes, 23 were Masters of Sports. As a result of the competition, five athletes broke the national record of two hours, fifty-one minutes, and fifteen seconds set in 1957. The photo shows Li Yudi.
