The distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages is essentially a combination of partial, elementary "to each according to his needs" and partial distribution according to work.

According to the "People's Daily" of September 29, 70% of the people's communes in Henan Province have implemented a distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages. This distribution system is as follows: the distribution of means of livelihood is partly based on a wage system of basic wages plus bonuses; and partly on a supply system. In Henan, the supply part has three forms: (1) Grain supply system, that is, free supply of rations to all members of the commune according to the national grain supply standards; (2) Food supply system, that is, the commune takes full responsibility for the food of all members, and eating in the commune canteen (including rice, vegetables, oil, salt, and firewood, etc.) is free of charge; (3) Basic living needs supply system, that is, according to the economic conditions within the commune and the consumption level of the members, the basic living needs of all members are supplied, such as food, clothing, housing, childbirth, education, medical care, and funeral expenses.

What is the nature of this distribution system? The wage part takes labor as the measure of distribution, that is, remuneration according to work. The supply part, however, does not take labor as the measure of distribution, but takes needs as the measure. This supply system is different from the supply system we implemented during the war and the early days of liberation. In the past, the supply system implemented in the army and among staff members was military communism; it was implemented under conditions of scarcity of living materials and relatively difficult living conditions. The partial supply system now implemented in some people's communes is a manifestation of considerable production development and increasingly abundant living materials. The current supply system is also different from the "to each according to his needs" of communist society: first, in communist society, all consumer goods are "to each according to his needs," while the current supply system only distributes a part of consumer goods according to needs; second, in communist society, people's consumption level is very high, and because products are extremely abundant, "to each according to his needs" can fully meet people's needs, and there is no limit on basic living needs; the current supply system has a lower consumption level and cannot but stipulate a limit. Despite these differences, since the current supply system is not distributed according to labor, but according to needs, it already belongs to the category of communist distribution principles. The difference between it and the "to each according to his needs" of communist society is that one is partial and elementary; the other is complete and advanced.

From this, it seems that the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages is essentially a combination of partial, elementary "to each according to his needs" (distribution according to needs) and partial remuneration according to work. Here, two distribution criteria—labor and needs—are working at the same time. The implementation of this distribution system is completely in line with the objective requirements of social development. It is the inevitable result of the great leap in production and the increased communist consciousness of the masses; it will inevitably promote a greater leap in production and a further increase in people's communist consciousness; at the same time, it is also the best form for a gradual transition to communism in terms of distribution.

Due to the great leap in production, distribution according to needs in certain areas has become an objective trend.

The implementation of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages must have certain conditions. The conditions are: (1) production is relatively developed, the income of the commune is stable, and it can guarantee the supply of food or basic living needs of the members; (2) the members have a considerable communist consciousness and can consciously consolidate labor discipline. Now, although it may not be possible for all communes to immediately implement this distribution system, it is an inevitable trend. What is the basis for saying this?

Since the great leap in production, communist social welfare and cultural undertakings have sprung up in various communes. For example: commune-run primary schools, middle schools, and technical schools are free or semi-free; nurseries and kindergartens are free or semi-free; maternity leave is paid wages (or work points) or the commune subsidizes a part; maternity hospitals and health centers are subsidized by the commune, and some even run collective free medical care (members pay part and the commune subsidizes part). Some communes also plan to allocate funds in batches within a few years to build houses and improve the living conditions of the members. From the perspective of distribution, this has already broken through the scope of distribution according to work and belongs to the category of distribution according to needs. As everyone knows, this has won the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of members. Why is it that it has won the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of members? In addition to the factor that people have raised their communist consciousness (of course, this is a very important factor), it is because doing so is a requirement for developing production, and thus it is in line with both the collective interests and the individual interests of the members. For example, running free nurseries and kindergartens is a necessary condition for liberating the vast number of women's labor force from housework; when they are liberated from housework and actively and conscientiously devote themselves to production, the total product of the entire commune will greatly increase, and thus the income of each member will also generally increase. The same is true for running free middle schools and technical schools. It can quickly train a large number of scientific and technological backbones for the commune and the entire society. This is an urgent requirement for the great leap in production, and it has a significant effect on promoting the production of the commune and increasing the income of each member. Because of this, even those who do not have children entering nurseries or schools, from the perspective of their personal interests, support the commune in running free nurseries, kindergartens, and free schools. In addition, the commune invests in maternity hospitals and health centers, runs collective free medical care, and pays wages during maternity leave, etc., all of which are required to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all members to promote production. Therefore, these measures are also in line with both collective interests and the individual interests of the members.

From the above analysis, we can see that commune-run communist social welfare and cultural undertakings, breaking through the scope of distribution according to work in certain smaller areas, is not accidental, but a requirement for developing production. This means that distribution according to needs in certain areas has become an objective trend. As mentioned above, the implementation of free nurseries and kindergartens, free school enrollment, wages during maternity leave, collective free medical care, and collective construction of houses by the commune in batches, isn't that the realization of the supply system in terms of childbirth, upbringing, education, medical care, and housing expenses? The partial supply system now implemented in some communes is actually expanding (expanding to aspects of food and clothing), improving, and institutionalizing the trend that has emerged since the great leap in production to begin breaking through the scope of distribution according to work in certain smaller areas.

The implementation of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages can greatly weaken the remnants of bourgeois rights and further promote the communist spirit.

On the basis of meeting certain conditions, the implementation of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages will inevitably promote a greater leap in production and a greater increase in the level of communist consciousness of the masses. Because this distribution system is fully in line with the requirements of social development at the present stage.

Marx said that the equal right of distribution according to work "is still in principle a bourgeois right, although principle and practice here are no longer in contradiction with each other." What does this mean? We know that the principle of capitalist commodity exchange is "equal exchange"; it is reflected in bourgeois rights as the so-called "equality" principle. But the essence of bourgeois rights is to safeguard and consolidate the capitalist system of exploitation. On the one hand, it stipulates formal equality, "the law should treat all citizens equally," and on the other hand, it stipulates that "private property is an inviolable and sacred right" (from the French "Declaration of the Rights of Man"). The latter is the axis of bourgeois rights, and all its legal clauses revolve around this axis. Therefore, in bourgeois society, the "equality" principle is in contradiction with practice. This equality is based on economic inequality. For workers, it is actually the right to be exploited and freely unemployed, so equality is empty talk. In socialist society, the private ownership of the means of production and the system of distribution based on the amount of means of production occupied have been abolished, and the distribution system of remuneration according to work has been implemented on the basis of public ownership of the means of production. In this way, the bourgeois rights have been abolished in terms of the ownership of the means of production. However, the principle of "equal exchange" is still in effect in the distribution of consumer goods, that is, consumer goods are distributed according to the quantity and quality of the labor of the laborers. It does not recognize any privileges, and all members of society (except those who have lost their ability to work) are paid according to their work. This is an equal right; however, for unequal individuals (strong or weak in body, high or low in technology), it is an unequal right. Therefore, the situation inevitably arises that those with strong labor ability and few children live well; those with weak labor ability and many children live poorly. Because the principle of "equal exchange" is still at work here, inequality still exists between unequal laborers, so Marx said that in principle this is a bourgeois right, because the equal right of remuneration according to work is truly realized, so he also said that "principle and practice are no longer in contradiction here." This means that in the distribution of consumer goods, there are still remnants of unequal bourgeois rights. At the same time, since the means of livelihood obtained according to work are privately owned and can become privately owned property, the bourgeois rights such as the right of inheritance, creditor's rights (of course, usury is not allowed), and bank deposit interest cannot but be preserved. These are all birthmarks left over from the old society.

However, as Marx said: "Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and the cultural development of society determined by this economic structure." In socialist society, it is impossible not to implement remuneration according to work. Remuneration according to work is first and foremost a weapon for fighting bourgeois ideology. This not only means implementing "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" to force the exploiters to participate in labor, but also plays a role in opposing the influence of bourgeois individualism and consolidating labor discipline among the laborers. However, this is only one aspect. On the other hand, due to the existence of remnants of bourgeois rights, bourgeois ideology, private ownership, and hierarchical concepts cannot be completely eliminated in the whole society. It is both a weapon for fighting bourgeois ideology and a condition for the partial existence of remnants of bourgeois ideology. This is a contradiction. If this contradiction is not properly handled, it will become prominent with the development of production and hinder the mobilization of people's enthusiasm. For example, those with many children, seeing that collective production has greatly developed and the lives of others have improved, but their own lives have not improved or have improved very little despite their equally active labor, their labor enthusiasm will not be high. And those with few children and strong labor ability, whose remuneration is too much and whose lives have improved too prominently (or have too much savings), will make them detached from the masses; and it may also foster individualistic ideas that more work is only for personal gain and hierarchical concepts that they are superior to others, and they may no longer be willing to actively work. If we one-sidedly emphasize more pay for more work, the stimulation of personal material interests, and ignore communist ideological education, then remuneration according to work, which was originally a weapon for fighting bourgeois ideology, will go to its own opposite and become something that promotes bourgeois ideology, seriously hindering socialist and communist construction.

So, how should this contradiction be handled?

Our party has consistently emphasized the command of communist ideology, on the one hand, implementing the distribution system of remuneration according to work; on the other hand, opposing excessive wage level gaps and large disparities in living standards, while strengthening communist education, especially teaching Communist Party members and advanced elements to treat remuneration according to work with communist ideology, advocating labor with more work and less pay and not counting on remuneration as an honor, and opposing being too calculating about personal gains and losses. Facts have proved that this is the only correct policy for handling the above-mentioned contradictions. All those who have resolutely implemented this policy (this is basic) have achieved the effect of promoting the communist spirit, strengthening unity, and fully mobilizing people's enthusiasm to develop production; on the contrary, all those who have deviated from this policy and one-sidedly emphasized the stimulation of personal material interests have promoted bourgeois ideology, seriously hindering the unity of the working people and the mobilization of people's enthusiasm.

Now that production has made a great leap forward, the distribution system of remuneration according to work itself is no longer completely suitable for the requirements of further development of production in some places. As mentioned earlier, life itself has required breaking through the scope of remuneration according to work in certain aspects. Should we completely abolish the distribution system of remuneration according to work? No. There is no material basis; from the perspective of the whole society, it has not completely lost its role in opposing bourgeois ideology. Remuneration according to work is still a weapon for fighting bourgeois ideology, but it has begun to hinder or will soon hinder the full mobilization of people's enthusiasm. Such is the objective contradiction. What should we do? Practice has answered this question. That is, in addition to continuing to strengthen communist ideological education, we should implement a distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages in distribution. In principle, this is precisely the concrete application of the party's guiding principle of communist ideology in command, on the one hand, implementing remuneration according to work, and on the other hand, opposing excessive wage level gaps and large disparities in living standards under new conditions.

The distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages skillfully and organically combines the two distribution criteria (labor, needs), and they complement and supplement each other. The partial supply system supplements remuneration according to work, preventing and overcoming the negative effects that have begun to arise or will soon arise, so that it only plays the role of promoting production and opposing bourgeois ideology, and does not play the role of hindering the mobilization of people's enthusiasm. The partial remuneration according to work supplements the supply system of distribution according to needs, preventing possible side effects among some people with low consciousness, so that it only plays the role of promoting production and raising people's communist consciousness. The implementation of this distribution system (1) can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all members; (2) can concentrate and unify the use of material resources, develop production and cultural education more quickly, and improve the lives of the masses more effectively; (3) can more effectively overcome bourgeois ideology and promote the communist spirit. The implementation of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages greatly weakens the remnants of bourgeois rights, and the partial supply system belongs to the category of communist distribution. This social existence will inevitably cause major changes in people's ideology and consciousness. Private ownership, the concept of bourgeois rights, individualism, and departmentalism will be quickly overcome; and collectivism, the communist spirit of unpaid labor for society, will inevitably be further promoted. All of this is of course of great significance for accelerating socialist and communist construction.

Another great significance of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages lies in providing the best form for the gradual transition from remuneration according to work to "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

We know in principle that the transition from remuneration according to work to "to each according to his needs" is gradual. However, in practice, through what form and what path is the gradual transition? Practice has answered this question: the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages is the best form of transition. This distribution system itself is transitional. Its transitional nature is manifested in: it has two distribution criteria according to needs and according to labor, and the proportion of these two distribution criteria changes with the development of production. From here, we can see a path of gradual transition, that is: with the development of production and the improvement of the communist consciousness of the masses, the supply part is gradually expanded and improved (expanding the scope of supply, increasing the quantity and quality of supply), and the wage part, that is, the part of distribution according to work, is gradually reduced, until the final realization of to each according to his needs. This path of gradual transition is the gradual transition from partial, elementary to each according to his needs to complete, advanced to each according to his needs; as for the speed of the transition, it is mainly determined by the development of production. I believe that this path of transition will be universally applicable; although there will be some differences in specific practices, in principle, it must be a combination of partial, elementary to each according to his needs and partial remuneration according to work. For example, Xiangshan Commune in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, implements a full supply system, but it is divided into two parts: free supply and paid supply, so in essence, it is also a combination of partial, elementary distribution according to needs and partial distribution according to work.

The gradual replacement of distribution according to work by distribution according to needs is an inevitable law of the transition from socialism to communism.

In the minds of some comrades, there is a one-sided absolute concept that in socialist society, remuneration according to work must be absolutely implemented, and there cannot be any factors or parts of to each according to his needs before entering communist society. This is wrong and violates dialectics. Marx pointed out in the "Critique of the Gotha Program": First, the cost of expanding reproduction must be deducted, and then the administrative expenses that do not belong to production, "expenses for meeting common needs, such as schools, health institutions, etc.," and "funds established for those who have lost their labor ability, etc." must also be deducted; after these deductions, distribution can be carried out according to labor. Obviously, "expenses for meeting common needs" and "funds established for those who have lost their labor ability" are not distributed according to labor, but according to needs. Marx also pointed out that "expenses for meeting common needs" "will increase day by day with the development of the new society." This means that with the development of the new society, the part that is collectively used and is essentially distributed according to needs will increase day by day.

Regarding the distribution in socialist society, Engels wrote in his letter "To C. Schmidt" in 1890: "The distribution mode largely depends on the amount of products being distributed, and this amount naturally changes with the progress of production and social organization, so the distribution mode should also change accordingly. However, in the opinion of all those who participated in the debate (note: refers to the debate on the distribution of products in socialist society - note by the translator), 'socialist society' is not a thing that is constantly changing and progressing, but a thing of stability and immutability, so it should have an immutable distribution mode. When reasoned logically, one can only (1) try to find the distribution mode with which to start in the future, (2) try to find the general direction in which further development will proceed." According to Engels' instructions, first, socialist society cannot have an immutable distribution mode, it must change with the development of production; second, the distribution mode of socialist society is a development process, it must gradually transition from the "distribution mode with which to start" (distribution according to work) to to each according to his needs. Therefore, in socialist society, the gradual emergence of factors and parts of to each according to his needs (elementary form) is inevitable. If it is always 100% distribution according to work, and distribution according to work is completely consolidated, then how can the remnants of bourgeois rights be gradually weakened and abolished, and gradually transition to communism? We acknowledge that the characteristics that distinguish socialist society from communist society are: the former "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," the latter "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." However, in practice, there cannot be a gap between the two, they are two stages of a society. The gradual replacement of distribution according to work by distribution according to needs is precisely the law of the development of communism from a lower stage to a higher stage.

The great significance of the distribution system combining partial supply and partial wages lies in pointing out: the concrete path for socialism to develop forward from the "distribution mode with which to start" with the development of production, and the concrete form for the gradual transition from remuneration according to work to to each according to his needs. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a major Marxist discovery obtained from practice under the guidance of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.

    向共产主义过渡的最好的分配形式
    试论部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度
    关锋
    部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，实质上是部分的、初级的“各取所需”和部分的按劳取酬相结合的分配制度。
    据9月29日“人民日报”载：河南省已经有70％的人民公社实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度。这种分配制度是这样的：生活资料的分配，一部分实行基本工资加奖励的工资制；一部分实行供给制。供给部分在河南有三种形式：（一）粮食供给制，即按照国家规定的粮食供应标准，免费供给全社人员的口粮；（二）伙食供给制，即由公社包干供给全社人员的伙食，在公社食堂里吃饭（包括饭、菜、油、盐和烧柴等）不要钱；（三）生活基本需要供给制，即根据社内经济条件和社员消费水平，供给全社人员的基本生活需要，如吃饭、穿衣、住房、生育、教育、看病和婚丧等费用。
    这种分配制度是属于什么性质的呢？工资部分，是以劳动作为分配的尺度，即按劳取酬。供给部分，却不是以劳动作为分配的尺度，而是以需要作为分配的尺度。这种供给制和我们在战争时期和解放初期实行的供给制不同。过去我们在军队、工作人员中实行的供给制是军事共产主义；是在生活物品缺乏、生活比较困难的条件下实行的。现在某些人民公社实行的部分供给制，则是生产相当发达、生活物品日益富裕的表现。现在的供给制和共产主义社会的“各取所需”也不同：第一，在共产主义社会里，全部消费品都是“各取所需”，现在的供给制只是一部分消费品按需要分配；第二，在共产主义社会里，人们的消费水平很高，由于产品极为丰富，“各取所需”能够充分满足人们的需要，基本生活需要不规定限量；现在的供给制，消费水平较低，还不能不规定一个限量。尽管有这些不同，但是由于现在的供给制已经不是按劳分配，而是按需要分配，所以它已经是属于共产主义分配原则的范畴。它跟共产主义社会的“各取所需”的区别在于：一个是部分的、初级的；一个是完全的、高级的。
    由此看来，部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，实质上是部分的、初级的“各取所需”（按需要分配）和部分的按劳取酬相结合的分配制度。在这里，是两种分配尺度——劳动和需要——同时起作用。实行这种分配制度是完全符合社会发展的客观要求的，它是生产大跃进和群众共产主义觉悟提高的必然结果；它又必然促进生产更大的跃进和人们共产主义觉悟更进一步的提高；同时，它又是在分配方面向共产主义逐步过渡的一种最好的形式。
    由于生产大跃进，在某些范围里实行按需要分配，已经成了客观趋势。
    实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，必须有一定条件。其条件就是：（1）生产比较发达，社的收入稳定，能够保证社员的粮食或基本生活需要的供给；（2）社员有相当的共产主义觉悟，能够自觉的巩固劳动纪律。现在，虽然还未必是所有公社都可以立即实行这种分配制度；但是，实行这种分配制度却是必然的趋势。根据什么这么说呢？
    生产大跃进以来，各个社里风起云涌地举办共产主义的社会福利和文化事业。例如：社办小学、中学、技术学校免费或半免费；托儿所、幼儿园免费或半免费；产妇假期照给工资（或工分）或社里津贴一部分；妇产院、卫生院社里津贴一部分，还有的举办集体公费医疗（社员出钱和社里津贴一部分）。还有的社，计划在几年之内由社里拨款分批兴建住宅，改善社员居住条件。这一些，从分配角度看来，它已经突破了按劳分配的范围，而是属于按需要分配的范畴了。大家知道，这是获得了广大社员的热烈拥护的。为什么会获得广大社员的热烈拥护？除了人们提高了共产主义觉悟这个因素以外（当然这是一个很重要的因素），就是因为：这样做是发展生产的要求，因而既符合集体利益，又符合社员的个人利益。例如办免费托儿所、幼儿园，这是把广大妇女劳动力从家务劳动中解放出来的必要条件；她们从家务劳动中解放出来，积极的安心的投入生产，就会使全社的总产品大大增加，因而每个社员的收益也普遍提高。办免费中学、技术学校也是这样，它能够迅速为本社和整个社会培养大批科学技术的骨干力量，这是生产大跃进的迫切要求，对于促进本社的生产和提高每个社员的收益是有重大作用的。正因为这样，所以没有子女入所、入校的，就是从其个人利益来考虑，也是拥护社里办免费托儿所、幼儿园和免费学校的。再如社里出资办妇产院、卫生院，举办集体公费医疗，产妇假期照发工资等，也都是充分调动所有社员的积极性以推动生产所要求的，因而这些措施也是既符合集体利益，又符合社员的个人利益的。
    从上面的分析我们可以看出：社办共产主义的社会福利和文化事业、在某些较小范围里突破按劳分配，不是偶然的，而是发展生产的要求。这也就是说：在某些范围里实行按需要分配，已经成了客观趋势。如上边所说，实行了托儿所、幼儿园免费，入校免费，产妇假期照发工资，集体公费医疗，社里集体分批兴建住宅等，不就是实现了生育、教养、教育、看病和住房费用等方面的供给制吗？现在某些公社实行的部分供给制，实际上就是把大跃进以来产生的开始在某些较小范围里突破按劳分配的趋势，加以扩大（扩大到吃饭穿衣方面）、提高和制度化。
    实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，可以大大削弱资产阶级法权的残余，进一步发扬共产主义精神。
    在具备一定条件的基础上，实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，必然推动生产更大的跃进和群众共产主义觉悟程度更大的提高。因为这种分配制度，完全符合现阶段社会发展的要求。
    马克思说过：按劳分配的平等权利，“在原则上仍然是资产阶级式的法权，虽然原则和实践在这里已不再互相矛盾”。这是什么意思呢？我们知道，资本主义商品交换的原则是“等价交换”；它反映在资产阶级的法权上就是所谓“平等”原则。但是资产阶级法权的实质是维护和巩固资本主义剥削制度的，它一方面规定了形式上的平等，“法律对一切的国民要有平等的待遇”，另一方面又规定“私有财产是一种不可侵犯的神圣权利”（法国“人权宣言”语），而后者是资产阶级法权的轴心，它的一切法律条文都是围绕着这个轴心旋转的。因此，在资产阶级的社会里，“平等”原则是和实践相矛盾的，这种平等是以经济不平等为基础的，对于工人说来，实际上是被剥削和自由失业的权利，所以平等是一句空话。在社会主义社会里，废除了生产资料私有制及根据占有生产资料多少来分配的制度，而在生产资料公有制的基础上实行了按劳取酬的分配制度。这样，在生产资料所有制方面，也就废除了资产阶级法权，但是，在消费品的分配方面起作用的却还是“等价交换”的原则，即按照劳动者劳动的数量和质量分配消费品。它不承认任何特权，对于所有的社会成员（除了丧失劳动能力的以外）都是按劳取酬，这是一个平等权利；但是，对于不同等的个人（身体强弱、技术高低）说来却是一个不平等的权利。因此，就不可避免地出现这种情况，劳动能力强、子女少的，生活就好；劳动能力弱、子女多的，生活就差。因为在这里起作用的还是“等价交换”的原则，在不同等的劳动者之间还存在着不平等，所以马克思说在原则上这是资产阶级式的法权，因为真正实现了按劳取酬的平等权利，所以他又说“原则和实践在这里已经不再相矛盾”了。这也就是说：在消费品的分配方面，还保留着不平等的资产阶级法权残余。同时，由于按劳所得的生活资料是归个人所有，可以成为私人所有的财产，也就不能不保存着继承权、债权（当然不准放高利贷）和银行存款利息等资产阶级法权。这一些都是旧社会遗留下来的斑痣。
    但是，如马克思所说：“法权永不能超过社会经济制度以及由此经济制度所决定的社会文化发展程度。”在社会主义社会里是不能不实行按劳取酬的。按劳取酬，首先是和资产阶级思想作斗争的武器。这不仅是实行“不劳动者不得食”来迫使剥削者参加劳动，而且，它在劳动者中间也起着反对资产阶级个人主义思想影响和巩固劳动纪律的作用。但是，这只是一方面。另一方面，由于资产阶级法权残余的存在，就整个社会说来，资产阶级思想，私有观念，等级观念，也还不能彻底肃清。又是和资产阶级思想作斗争的武器，又是资产阶级思想残余得以部分存在下去的一种条件，这是一个矛盾。对这个矛盾如不适当处理，会随着生产的发展突出起来，妨碍调动人们的积极性。例如，子女多的，看到集体生产大大发展了，别人的生活改善了，自己同样积极劳动但自家的生活却没有改善或很少改善，他们的劳动积极性就会不高。而子女少、劳动能力强的，所得报酬过多，生活提高得过分突出（或存款过多），就会使他们脱离群众；并且可能滋长多劳只是为了个人多得的个人主义思想和高人一等的等级观念，也可能不再愿意积极劳动。如果片面地强调多劳多得、个人物质利益的刺激，忽视共产主义思想教育，那末，按劳分配这个本来是和资产阶级思想作斗争的武器，就会走到它自己的反面，成为助长资产阶级思想的东西，严重妨碍社会主义和共产主义建设。
    那么，应该怎样处理这种矛盾呢？
    我们党一贯的强调共产主义思想挂帅，一方面贯彻执行按劳取酬的分配制度；一方面又反对工资级别距离过大、生活悬殊，同时加强共产主义教育，特别是教导共产党员、先进分子要以共产主义思想对待按劳取酬，提倡以多劳少得、不计报酬的劳动为光荣，而反对斤斤计较个人得失。事实证明，这是处理上述矛盾的唯一正确方针。凡是坚决贯彻执行了这个方针的（这是基本的），就收到了发扬共产主义精神、加强团结和充分调动人们的积极性以发展生产的效果；反之，凡是离开了这个方针而片面强调个人物质利益刺激的，就助长了资产阶级思想，严重地妨碍了劳动人民的团结和调动人们的积极性。
    现在生产大跃进了，按劳取酬的分配制本身在某些地方已经不完全适合生产进一步发展的要求了。如前边所说，生活本身已经要求在某些方面突破按劳取酬的范围。完全取消按劳取酬的分配制度吗？不行。没有物质基础；从整个社会说来，它还没有完全失掉反对资产阶级思想的作用。按劳取酬仍然是反对资产阶级思想的武器，但是它又开始妨碍或即将妨碍充分调动人们的积极性。客观的矛盾就是如此。怎么办？实践回答了这个问题，这就是除了继续加强共产主义思想教育以外，在分配上实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度。从原则上说来，这正是党的共产主义思想挂帅，一方面实行按劳取酬，一方面反对工资级别距离过大、生活悬殊这个指导方针在新条件下的具体运用。
    部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，把两种分配尺度（劳动、需要）巧妙地有机结合了起来，它们相反相成，相互补充。部分供给制补充按劳取酬，防止和克服它开始产生或即将产生的消极作用，使它只起推动生产和反对资产阶级思想的作用，而不起妨碍调动人们的积极性的作用。部分的按劳取酬补充按需要分配的供给制，防止可能在某些觉悟不高的人们当中产生副作用，使它只起推动生产和提高人们共产主义觉悟的作用。实行这种分配制度，（一）可以充分调动所有社员的积极性；（二）可以集中、统一使用物力，更快地发展生产和文化教育以及更有效地改善群众生活；（三）可以更有效地克服资产阶级思想，发扬共产主义精神。实行部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，就大大地削弱了资产阶级法权的残余，部分供给制又是属于共产主义分配范畴的，这种社会存在必然引起人们思想意识的重大变化。私有观念、资产阶级法权观念、个人主义、本位主义将得到迅速克服；而集体主义、不计报酬为社会劳动的共产主义精神，必然会得到更高的昂扬。这一些，对于加速社会主义和共产主义建设，当然是有巨大意义的。
    部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度的另一个巨大意义，在于对由按劳取酬向“各尽所能，各取所需”逐步过渡提供了一种最好的形式。
    我们从原则上知道，从按劳取酬到“各取所需”是逐渐过渡的。但是，在实践上通过什么形式、何种途径逐渐过渡呢？实践回答了这个问题：部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度，就是一种最好的过渡形式。这种分配制度本身就是过渡性的，其过渡性表现在：它具有按需要和按劳动的两种分配尺度，以及这两种分配尺度的比重随着生产的发展而变化。从这里，我们可以看出一条逐渐过渡的途径，这就是：随着生产的发展和群众共产主义觉悟的提高，而逐步扩大和提高供给部分（扩大供给范围，提高供给的数量和质量），逐步缩小工资即按劳分配的部分，以至最后完全实现各取所需。这条逐步过渡的途径，即是由部分的初级的各取所需逐步向完全的高级的各取所需过渡；至于过渡的缓速则主要的由生产的发展决定。我以为这条过渡的途径，将是普遍适用的；尽管在具体作法上会有若干差别，但是从原则上说来，必然是部分的初级的各取所需和部分的按劳取酬相结合。例如安徽无为县响山社实行的是全供给制，但是分成无偿供给和有偿供给两部分，所以实质上也是部分的初级的按需要分配和部分的按劳分配相结合。
    按劳分配逐渐为按需要分配所代替，是社会主义向共产主义过渡的必然规律。
    某些同志的头脑里，有一个片面的绝对的观念，认为在社会主义社会里必须绝对的实行按劳取酬，直到进入共产主义社会以前不能有任何各取所需的因素、部分。这是不对的，违背辩证法的。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中指出：首先要扣除扩大再生产的费用，然后还须扣除不属于生产的管理费用，“作为共同满足需要的费用，如学校、保健机关等费用”，“为丧失劳动力者设立的基金等”；作了这些扣除之后，才能按照劳动进行分配。显然，“作为共同满足需要的费用”、“为丧失劳动力者设立的基金”这部分生活资料不是按劳分配，而是按需要分配的。马克思还指出，“作为共同满足需要的费用”，“将随着新社会的发展而日益增加。”这就是说，随着新社会的发展，集体使用而实质上是按需要分配的部分要日益增加。
    关于社会主义社会的分配，恩格斯在1890年“致康·施米特”的信中曾经写道：“分配方式在很大程度上取决于所被分配的产品数量，而这种数量当然随着生产和社会组织的进步而改变，从而分配方式也应随着改变的。但是，在所有参加辩论（按：指关于社会主义社会产品分配的辩论——引者注）的人看来，‘社会主义社会’并不是一种经常改变、经常进步的东西，而是一种稳定性的、一成不变的东西，因而它应当有个一成不变的分配方式。合理推论起来时，只能（一）设法发现将来由以开始的分配方式，（二）尽力找出进一步的发展将循以进行的总方向。”根据恩格斯的指示，第一，社会主义社会不能有个一成不变的分配方式，它必然随着生产的发展而变化；第二，社会主义社会的分配方式是一个发展过程，它必然从“由以开始的分配方式”（按劳分配）逐步向各取所需过渡。因此，在社会主义社会里，逐步产生各取所需的因素、部分（初级形式）是必然的。如果一直是百分之百的按劳分配，一直把按劳分配完完全全的巩固起来，那怎么能逐步削弱、废除资产阶级法权残余，逐渐向共产主义过渡呢？我们承认社会主义社会和共产主义社会区别开来的特征是：前者“各尽所能，按劳取酬”，后者“各尽所能，各取所需”。但是，在实践上两者不能隔着一道鸿沟，它们是一个社会的两个阶段。按劳分配逐渐一步一步地为按需要分配所代替，正是共产主义由低级阶段向高级阶段发展的规律。
    部分供给和部分工资相结合的分配制度的伟大意义，就在于它指出了：社会主义从“由以开始的分配方式”，随着生产的发展而向前发展的具体途径，由按劳取酬向各取所需逐步过渡的具体形式。毫不夸大的说，这是在马克思主义、毛泽东思想指导下，从实践中获得的一个重大的马克思主义的发现。
