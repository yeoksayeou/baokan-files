Dear Comrades and Friends:

	We, the delegation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, on the occasion of attending this conference in the Chinese capital with social figures and many foreign guests, would like to extend to you, our dear Chinese friends, our congratulations on the upcoming National Day – the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	In our hearts, we bring the love and respect of the Soviet people for the great Chinese people – our friends and faithful allies in the struggle for socialism and communism.

	Dear friends, the working people of our country, the people of the socialist camp, and peace-loving people all over the world join you in rejoicing at the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in developing its national economy and culture and in improving the material and cultural living standards of its people.

	We are not only happy for the achievements of the People's Republic of China, but we also admire the heroic efforts of the fraternal Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, are transforming China into a powerful socialist industrialized country.

	After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the friendship between our two peoples entered a new stage of development. The Soviet people remember that the Chinese Volunteer Army once took up arms alongside our working class and peasants to heroically defend the young Soviet Republic. The Soviet people will always have deep sympathy for the Chinese people's heroic struggle for their freedom and independence. We have forged an unbreakable friendship in the common struggle against the common enemy – the imperialists.

	After the Chinese people achieved their historic victory, our friendship became not only a powerful factor for peace in the Far East, but also a powerful factor for peace in the whole world.

	There is no force in the world that can weaken the unbreakable and eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The basis of the fraternal unity of our two peoples is the loyalty to the great and invincible Marxism-Leninism, our common fervent desire to build a communist society, and our common fervent desire to live in peace and friendship with all peoples, regardless of their social system.

	The historic meeting in Beijing between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev vividly demonstrated the fraternal friendship, common goals, and unwavering unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

	At the rallies of friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples held throughout our country, the Soviet people unanimously endorsed the results of the Beijing talks and resolutely stated that they would continue to do everything possible to strengthen the unity of the Soviet and Chinese peoples in the face of the aggressive actions of the imperialists who are inciting a new world war.

	In our country, everyone's heart is filled with a strong hatred for the US imperialists, who have embarked on the path of war adventure directly against the peace-loving Chinese people. The imperialist gentlemen may well remember the wise Chinese proverb – "As you sow, so shall you reap."

	The Soviet working people, together with the Chinese people, the people of the socialist camp, and all progressive humanity, resolutely demand that the United States troops immediately withdraw from the Taiwan area and stop provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait.

	Our determination to steadfastly defend the cause of world peace together with the peace-loving people of the world is unshakable.

	We are very happy to participate in this conference and warmly congratulate the establishment of ten friendship associations between China and other socialist countries. The establishment of these associations will undoubtedly be a new contribution to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of all countries and will further consolidate the cause of peace.

	At this solemn moment, on the eve of the glorious National Day of the People's Republic of China, we shout:

	Long live the great Chinese people!

	Long live the friendship between the peoples of all countries for peace, democracy and progress!

    加强各国人民友谊的新贡献
    苏中友协代表团团长契列德尼钦科的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我们苏中友好协会代表团，值此参加中国首都社会人士和许多外国客人出席的这次大会的之际，仅向你们，亲爱的中国朋友们，祝贺即将到来的国庆节——中华人民共和国成立九周年。
    在我们的心中带来了苏联人民对于伟大中国人民——为社会主义和共产主义而斗争的我们的朋友和忠实同盟者的热爱和尊敬。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们祖国的劳动者和社会主义阵营国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民同你们一起，共同为中华人民共和国在发展国家经济和文化方面、在提高人民物质生活水平和文化水平方面所取得的巨大成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    我们不仅为中华人民共和国的成就而高兴，我们也赞美兄弟中国人民的英勇努力，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下正在把中国变成一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命之后，我们两国人民之间的友谊进入了新的发展阶段。苏联人记得，中国志愿军曾经同我国工人阶级和农民一起拿起武器英勇地保卫过年轻的苏维埃共和国。苏联人民对中国人民争取自己的自由和独立的英勇斗争永远怀着深切的同情。我们在反对共同的敌人——帝国主义者的共同斗争中结成了牢不可破的友谊。
    在中国人民取得了历史性的胜利之后，我们的友谊不仅成了远东和平的强大因素，而且也成了全世界和平的强大因素。
    在世界上没有任何力量能够削弱中苏之间牢不可破的永恒的友谊。我们两国人民兄弟团结的基础是对于伟大的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的忠诚，是我们建设共产主义社会的共同的热烈愿望，是我们同各国人民，不论其社会制度如何，和平友好相处的共同的热烈愿望。
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志在北京的历史性的会谈，鲜明地表现了中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊、共同的目标和不可动摇的团结。
    在我们全国各地举行的苏中两国人民友好的集会上，苏联人民一致赞同北京会谈的结果，并且坚决表示在煽动新世界大战的帝国主义者的侵略行动面前，继续尽一切力量来加强苏中人民的团结。
    在我们国家里，每个人的心中都充满着对美帝国主义者的强烈仇恨，美帝国主义者已走上直接对爱好和平的中国人民的进行战争冒险的道路。帝国主义先生们不妨牢牢记住中国的一句英明的谚语——“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”。
    苏联劳动人民和中国人民、社会主义阵营各国人民以及全体进步人类一起，坚决要求美国军队立即从台湾地区撤退和停止在台湾海峡的挑衅行动。
    我们同全世界爱好和平的人民一道坚定不移地捍卫世界和平事业的决心是不可动摇的。
    我们非常高兴地参加这个大会，并热烈祝贺中国与其他社会主义国家的十个友好协会的成立。这些协会的成立无疑将是加强各国人民之间友谊的新贡献，并且将使和平事业得到进一步的巩固。
    在这个庄严的时刻，在中华人民共和国光荣的国庆的前夕，我们高呼：
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    为了和平、民主和进步的各国人民之间的友谊万岁！
