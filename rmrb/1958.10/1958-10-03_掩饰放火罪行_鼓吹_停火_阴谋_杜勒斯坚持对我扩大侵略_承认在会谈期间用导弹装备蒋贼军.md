Xinhua News Agency, 2nd Dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once again delivered a preposterous speech at a press conference on September 30, insisting on expanding aggression against our country and sophistically defending this aggressive behavior of the United States. Dulles's speech showed that the United States will continue to play the conspiracy of a so-called "ceasefire."

A reporter asked Dulles whether it could be said that the United States' policy in the Taiwan Strait has not changed up to now. In answering this question, Dulles apparently attempted to confuse world and American public opinion regarding the worries and criticisms of the American war-mongering policy. He said, "Our (American) policy in this regard is flexible and adapts to the situations we must deal with. If the situation we must deal with changes, our policy will also change accordingly." The "change" in the situation that Dulles is talking about here refers to China "conceding" to the military provocation policy of U.S. imperialism and the Chinese people stopping punishing Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Obviously, this is just another trick.

In this speech, Dulles clearly stated that the United States will insist on playing the conspiracy of so-called "renunciation of the use of force" and "ceasefire," attempting to restrain the Chinese people and make them submit to the slaughter of U.S. imperialism.

Not only that, Dulles also openly stated that he would support Chiang Kai-shek's restoration in mainland China, fantasizing about a so-called "Hungarian incident" happening in China. He said, "If some kind of unrest and chaos occur on the mainland, such as the kind of incident that broke out in Hungary, then a free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek remnant traitorous group) with considerable power a few miles away may become a very important factor in the situation." He also said that in that case, "If a government recognized (by the United States) asks for assistance, I would not think that would involve armed intervention in China." Dulles's remarks most clearly show that U.S. imperialism has not given up its conspiracy to invade mainland China by force and subvert the Chinese government for a moment.

Dulles's speech also exposed that the U.S. government is not sincere about the current Sino-U.S. talks in Warsaw. The United States is attempting to prolong the Warsaw Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks for a long time, wanting to use the guise of talks to conceal the U.S. aggression against China. He said that the Warsaw talks "may last for quite a long time" and "may continue almost indefinitely." He even said, "Walking a little slower may be more conducive to the cause of peace." However, Dulles's speech showed that the "cause of peace" in his mouth is just a synonym for preparing to expand the war of aggression. He admitted that the United States equipped Chiang Kai-shek's group of traitorous troops with "Sidewinder" missiles during the Warsaw talks. He said, "They do have Sidewinders" missiles, and "improving" the training and equipment of Chiang Kai-shek's air force has always been "part of the effort" of the United States. Dulles attempted to conceal the conspiracy of the United States to help and condone Chiang Kai-shek in intensifying and expanding provocations against mainland China by this method. He described the United States supplying Chiang Kai-shek with "Sidewinder" missiles during the Sino-U.S. Warsaw talks as "purely accidental."

When talking about the situation in Jinmen and Mazu, Dulles, on the one hand, said that it was "stupid" and "unwise" for the Chiang Kai-shek group to station "a considerable number of troops" on these islands, but at the same time admitted that this provocative action by the Chiang gang was approved by its American master. He said, "The United States does not think it is right to undertake the obligation to use force on a large scale in these areas as the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang gang) hopes. But in view of the firm attitude of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang gang), we reluctantly acquiesced in this opinion. We did not try to oppose this opinion."

Dulles said that the United States does not have any legal obligation to defend the coastal islands of China, but he also said, "If the President of the United States believes that defending the coastal islands is necessary or appropriate for defending the (U.S.-Chiang) treaty area, U.S. troops can also be used for this purpose."

When asked about the recent revelations in American newspapers that the U.S. State Department received a large number of letters opposing the U.S. war-mongering policy in the Taiwan Strait, Dulles showed a completely indifferent attitude towards public opinion. He said, "Foreign policy cannot be swayed by public opinion," and "Public opinion expressed through opinion polls and letters cannot be used as the basis for public policy." He said, "The fact is that we do not intend to revise our policy."

    掩饰放火罪行　鼓吹“停火”阴谋
    杜勒斯坚持对我扩大侵略
    承认在会谈期间用导弹装备蒋贼军
    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯9月30日在记者招待会上又发表了一通坚持扩大对我国的侵略，并为美国这种侵略行为进行狡辩的谬论。杜勒斯的谈话表明了美国将继续玩弄“停火”的阴谋。
    有记者问杜勒斯，是否可以说美国在台湾海峡的政策到现在为止没有改变？杜勒斯在回答这个问题时显然是企图迷惑世界的以及美国的舆论对美国战争冒险政策表示的忧虑和抨击。他说，“我们（美国）于这方面的政策是灵活的，是适应在我们必须应付的局势的。如果我们必须应付的局势改变了，我们的政策也会随之改变”。杜勒斯在这里说的局势的“改变”指的是要中国向美帝国主义的军事挑衅政策“让步”，要中国人民停止惩罚蒋贼军，显然，这只不过是又一个骗局。
    杜勒斯在这次谈话中清楚地表明，美国将坚持玩弄所谓“放弃使用武力”和“停火”的阴谋，企图以此来束缚中国人民的手脚，使中国人民听任美帝国主义的宰割。
    不仅如此，杜勒斯还公然表示要支持蒋介石在中国大陆复辟，幻想在中国发生所谓“匈牙利事件”。他说，“如果大陆上发生某种动乱和混乱，譬如说匈牙利爆发的那种事件，那么，在几英里之外有一个拥有相当大力量的自由中国（指蒋介石残余卖国集团），就可能成为局势中的一个非常重要的因素。”他还说，在那种情况下，“如果一个得到（美国）承认的政府要求援助的话，我不会认为那会牵涉到对中国的武装干涉”。杜勒斯的这段话最清楚不过地说明了：美帝国主义一刻也没有放弃武装侵略中国大陆和颠复中国政府的阴谋活动。
    杜勒斯这次谈话还暴露美国政府对目前在华沙进行的中美会谈是没有诚意的。美国正在企图长期拖延华沙中美大使级会谈，它想借用会谈的外衣来掩饰美国对中国的侵略。他说，华沙会谈“可能进行相当长的时间”，“可能几乎无限期地举行下去”。他竟然说，“步子
  走得慢一些也许更有利于和平的事
  业”。但是，杜勒斯的谈话表明，他嘴里的“和平事业”不过是准备扩大侵略战争的同义语。他承认美
  国在华沙会谈期间用“响尾蛇”导弹装备了蒋介石集团卖国军队，他说，“他们确实有响尾蛇”式导弹，“改善”蒋介石空军的训练和装备一直是美国的“努力的一部分”。杜勒斯企图掩饰美国用这种办法帮助和纵容蒋介石加剧和扩大对中国大陆的挑衅的阴谋，他把美国在中美华沙会谈期间供给蒋介石“响尾蛇”导弹说成是“纯粹是偶然的”。
    在谈到金门和马祖的局势时，杜勒斯一方面说蒋介石集团在这些岛屿上驻扎“为数不少的部队是愚蠢的”，“不明智的”，同时又承认：蒋帮的这种挑衅行动是得到其美国主子的批准的。他说，“美国并不认为像中国政府（指蒋帮）希望的那样承担在这些地区大规模地使用武力的义务是正确的。但是鉴于中华民国（指蒋帮）态度很坚决，我们勉强地默然同意了这种意见。我们没有试图反对这种意见。”
    杜勒斯说，美国并没有保卫中国沿海岛屿的任何法律义务，但是，他又说，“如果美国总统认为保卫沿海岛屿对于保卫（美蒋）条约地区是必要的或者适当的，也就可以把美国部队用于这个目的。”
    有记者问到，最近美国报纸透露出来的美国国务院收到大批信件反对美国在台湾海峡的战争冒险政策的事，杜勒斯表现了全然漠视公众舆论的态度，他说，“不能让外交政策为舆论所左右”，“通过民意测验和信件表现出来的舆论是不能作为公共政策的依据的”，他说，“事实是我们并不打算修改我们的政策。”
