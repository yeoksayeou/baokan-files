Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. According to TASS: Marshal Amir, Vice President and Minister of Defense of the United Arab Republic, who is currently visiting Moscow, held a grand reception on the evening of the 21st.

Soviet leaders Khrushchev, Kozlov, Mikoyan and others attended the reception.

At the reception, Marshal Amir and Khrushchev delivered speeches successively.

In his speech, Amir said that the relationship between the Soviet Union and the UAR marks the victory of the Bandung principles.

He said that the firm stance taken by the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, led by the Soviet Union, is of great significance in guaranteeing the victory of our people's struggle against aggression and against imperialist conspiracies. The Soviet Union's stance against the imperialist attempt to suppress the rising tide of the liberation movement in Arab countries, together with the general struggle of the Arab people, played a decisive role in defeating imperialist conspiracies.

Amir said that the struggle against imperialist conspiracies continues. A few days ago, we received a message saying that imperialism plans to strengthen the armed forces of Israel, which is an aggressive springboard placed by the imperialists in the heart of Arab countries and a constant source of threat to peace in the region. He said, however, I would like to tell you and the world that the Arab people are vigilant in the face of this threat, and they will certainly be able to crush all attempts to deprive them of their hard-won independence, and crush all attempts to bring them back under the control of imperialist forces.

Marshal Amir said that the people and government of our country are closely watching the struggle of the friendly Chinese people, and believe that the issue in that region is an internal affair of the Chinese people, and any foreign interference would pose a threat to world peace.

Amir said that the people of the United Arab Republic welcome the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union with enthusiasm and great excitement. He said that the purpose of this assistance is to realize the industrialization of the United Arab Republic, improve the living standards, and strengthen the economic independence of the United Arab Republic. This economic assistance has no purpose of establishing domination and no purpose of establishing spheres of influence.

In his speech, Khrushchev expressed his gratitude to Marshal Amir for his praise of the Soviet people and the Soviet government. He said that the Soviet government firmly fights for peace, for peaceful coexistence, and for ensuring a situation in which some countries do not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. There is no estrangement in the relations between the Soviet Union and Arab countries. Relations of sincere friendship and cooperation have been established between our countries.

Khrushchev emphasized that the era when lions used roars to scare people, occupied other countries with impunity, and plundered the people of various countries, is gone forever. New forces – the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries – have been born. These countries have every possibility to block the road of imperialism and prevent them from intimidating those peoples who are still weak today but are full of determination to fight for their freedom and independence.

Khrushchev said that the imperialists want to establish an international gendarmerie force actually controlled by the United States to suppress the people of all countries who resist colonial enslavement. This will not succeed! The peace-loving people of all countries have enough strength to oppose the conspiracies of the imperialists and crush their vicious plots. There is no force in the world that can stop the movement of the people of all countries who are fighting for their independence and liberation.

When talking about the issue of economically assisting underdeveloped countries, Khrushchev pointed out the characteristics of the Soviet government and other socialist countries’ governments implementing the policy of selfless assistance, and at the same time exposed the essence of the imperialist countries’ "aid" to underdeveloped countries.

Khrushchev said that the Western press is talking lavishly about the need to economically assist underdeveloped countries. We are in favor of providing such assistance. Let us have a competition in this regard. But such economic assistance must be provided in such a way that the countries receiving the assistance have the possibility to truly develop their own economy, have the possibility to get rid of their dependence on economically strong countries, and practically guarantee their independence.

    赫鲁晓夫在阿密尔举行的招待会上说
    社会主义国家能堵塞帝国主义的道路
    阿密尔强调苏联坚定立场对阿拉伯民族运动的作用
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：正在莫斯科访问的阿拉伯联合共和国副总统兼国防部长阿密尔元帅，21日晚间举行了盛大的招待会。
    苏联领导人赫鲁晓夫、科兹洛夫、米高扬等出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，阿密尔元帅和赫鲁晓夫相继讲了话。
    阿密尔在讲话中说，苏联同阿联之间的关系标志着万隆原则的胜利。
    他说，以苏联为首的世界各国爱好和平的人民所采取的坚定的立场对于保证我国人民反对侵略、反对帝国主义阴谋的斗争的胜利具有重大意义。苏联对帝国主义想镇压阿拉伯各国日益高涨的解放运动浪潮的企图所采取的立场、同阿拉伯人民普遍的斗争一起，在击败帝国主义阴谋方面起了决定性的作用。
    阿密尔说，反对帝国主义阴谋的斗争在继续着。几天前我们得到了一个消息说，帝国主义计划加强以色列的武装部队，而以色列是帝国主义者安置在阿拉伯国家心脏的侵略跳板和经常威胁这个地区和平的策源地。他说，但是，我愿意告诉你们和全世界，阿拉伯人民在这个威胁的面前是警惕的，他们一定能粉碎一切想剥夺他们取得的独立的企图，粉碎一切使他们回到帝国主义势力控制下的企图。
    阿密尔元帅说，我国人民和我国政府密切注视着友好的中国人民的斗争，并且认为，在那个地区的问题是中国人民内部的事情，任何外国干涉都会造成对世界和平的威胁。
    阿密尔谈到，阿拉伯联合共和国的人民怀着热情和巨大的兴奋欢迎苏联的真诚援助。他说，这种援助的目的是实现阿拉伯联合共和国的工业化，提高生活水平和加强阿拉伯联合共和国的经济独立。这种经济援助没有建立统治的目的，没有建立势力的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中对阿密尔元帅对苏联人民和苏联政府的称赞表示感谢。他说，苏联政府坚决地为和平、为和平共处、为确保不使一些国家干涉别国内政这样一个局面而斗争。在苏联和阿拉伯国家的关系中没有任何隔阂。在我们这些国家之间建立了真诚友好和合作的关系。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，狮子用咆哮吓唬人民的时代，不受惩罚地占领其他国家和掠夺各国人民的时代，已经一去不复返了。新的力量——苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家诞生了。这些国家有一切可能来堵塞帝国主义的道路，不让他们恫吓今天还软弱、但充满决心为本国自由和独立而斗争的那些人民。
    赫鲁晓夫说，帝国主义者想建立一种实际上由美国控制的国际宪兵部队，用以镇压反抗殖民主义奴役的各国人民。这是不能得逞的！爱好和平的各国人民有足够力量，来反对帝国主义者的阴谋，粉碎他们恶毒的阴谋。世界上没有一种力量能够制止为本国独立和解放而斗争的各国人民的运动。
    在谈到关于经济上援助不发达的国家的问题时，赫鲁晓夫指出了苏联政府和其他社会主义国家政府执行无私援助的政策的特点，他同时还揭穿了帝国主义国家“援助”不发达国家的实质。
    赫鲁晓夫说，西方国家的报刊侈谈什么必须在经济上援助不发达国家。我们是主张提供这种援助的。让我们在这方面来个竞赛吧。但是必须提供这样的经济援助：接受援助的国家要有可能真正发展自己的经济，有可能摆脱对经济上强的国家的依赖，在实际上保证自己的独立。
