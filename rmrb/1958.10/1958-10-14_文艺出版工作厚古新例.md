    A New Example of Emphasizing the Past in Literary Publishing
    Liu Housheng

    To commemorate the 700th anniversary of Guan Hanqing's creative life, the China Drama Publishing House has compiled and published a complete collection of his existing works, "Guan Hanqing's Plays." This is the first time in Chinese history that a playwright's works have been treated so solemnly as a valuable cultural heritage of the motherland and published in a complete collection. This is a very meaningful undertaking and worthy of gratitude. The layout and format of the book are also very generous and eye-catching, worthy of being called "large-character complete edition."

    However, after reading a few plays, flipping through the entire book, and studying the "Editorial Notes," I felt somewhat uneasy and had a question.

    When publishing such a book, especially when widely introducing and commemorating Guan Hanqing among the broad masses, and publishing his complete works for the first time, should the primary purpose be popularization or improvement? I believe it should be the former. But judging from the current situation of the book, it seems to be for "improvement."

    Mr. Wu Xiaoling said in the "Editorial Notes": "This time, our editorial work utilized a relatively large number of versions." How many? The main ones include nine Yuan drama collections such as "Thirty Kinds of Yuan Carved Ancient and Modern Dramas," and "World Library" was also consulted. For each play, one version is used as the "base text," and one to three versions are used as "collation texts." The result of the editing and collation is that a "collation note" is attached to the end of each play, listing the differences between the various collation texts and the base text word by word. The "collation notes" are extensive, with the "collation notes" for the eighteen zaju plays reaching a total of four hundred and eighty-eight pages, accounting for more than half of the entire book (excluding the "appendix") of nine hundred and twenty-two pages. That is to say, in the thick two-volume complete collection, more than one volume is collation.

    General readers do not need to, nor is it possible, to flip through the "collation notes" thirty times when reading a page such as "Wangjiang Pavilion Mid-Autumn Festival Cutting Carp Dan" (page 735) to see "This word is not in the Zang edition" or "Guqu Zhai edition makes '×' character." In fact, it is impossible to remember even after reading it. What readers need most is to understand these great works from seven hundred years ago. In this regard, the "Drama Collection" does not provide any annotations or explanations for many Yuan Dynasty customs, terms, dialects, obscure characters, allusions, etc., that are not easily understood by today's general readers. Even the punctuation is still in the old style of one circle per sentence, instead of the new punctuation.

    This shows that the publication of this book is for studying the differences in versions of Guan Hanqing's works, rather than for the general reader to understand Guan Hanqing. In fact, the average reader spent the money for two volumes to buy one volume.

    I do not mean to negate the collation work. For studying the differences in versions of Guan Hanqing's works, and for pioneering "Guan Studies," collation work is necessary, and the arduous work of Mr. Wu Xiaoling and others will not be in vain. However, the results of this work, which is not urgently needed, should be published as "Collection of Collated Versions of Guan Hanqing's Works," rather than as a large-character complete edition like the present one for the purpose of wide commemoration.

    Because the "Guan Hanqing Drama Collection" was the first to be sent to readers during the widest commemoration of Guan Hanqing, including the most complete works of Guan, we have reason to demand it first from the perspective of popularization.

    文艺出版工作厚古新例
    刘厚生
    中国戏剧出版社为了纪念关汉卿创作生活七百年，编校出版了他的现存作品全集“关汉卿戏曲集”。中国历史上的剧作家的作品被这样郑重地当做祖国宝贵的文化遗产，编印全集，这还是第一人第一次。这是非常有意义的工作，是值得感谢的。书的编排格式等等也很大方醒目，称得上是“大字足本”。
    然而当我读了几出戏，翻阅了全书，研读了“编校后记”之后，却觉得有些不舒畅，产生了一个疑问。
    出这样的一部书，特别是在广大群众中间广泛介绍、纪念关汉卿，第一次出他的全集时，最主要的目的应该是普及呢，还是提高？我认为应该是前者。但从现在出的书的情况看来，似乎是为了“提高”。
    吴晓铃先生在“编校后记”中说：“这一次我们的编校工作利用的版本是较多的，”有多少呢？主要的，有“元椠古今杂剧三十种”等元曲集书九种，同时还参考了“世界文库”等。每一出戏，都用一种版本做“底本”，同时再分别用一到三种版本做“校本”。编校的结果，就是在每一出戏的后面附上一篇“校勘记”，把各种校本与底本不同之处逐字分别列出。“校勘记”的篇幅浩繁，十八个杂剧的“校勘记”共达四百八十八页，占全书（“附录”不计）九百二十二页的一半以上。也就是说，现在厚厚的两册全集中，有一册以上都是校勘。
    一般读者不必要、也不可能在看一页例如“望江亭中秋切鱠旦”（七百三十五页）时，要翻上三十次“校勘记”去看“臧本无此字”或“顾曲斋本作‘×’字”之类的校勘。事实上看了也根本无从记住。读者所需要的，首先是读懂这些七百年前的伟大作品。而在这一方面，“戏曲集”对于许多为今日一般读者所不易明了的元代习惯、用语、方言、僻字、典故等等却无一字注解，无一语阐释。连标点都还是按老式一句一圈，而不用新式标点。
    这就说明：这部书的出版，是为了研究关汉卿著作版本差异比较，而不是为了一般读者读懂关汉卿、了解关汉卿。一般读者事实上是花了两册书的钱买了一册书。
    我没有意思否定校勘工作，对于研究关汉卿著作的版本差异，对于开创“关学”，校勘工作有其必要，吴晓铃等先生的繁重工作不致白费。然而这种并非当务之急的工作的结果，应该出版的是“关汉卿著作版本校勘集”，而不是像现在这样的大字足本以广泛纪念为目的的全集。
    “关汉卿戏曲集”由于是在最广泛地纪念关汉卿时，最先送到读者手中的，包括了最完全的关氏作品，因此我们有理由首先从普及的角度来要求它。
