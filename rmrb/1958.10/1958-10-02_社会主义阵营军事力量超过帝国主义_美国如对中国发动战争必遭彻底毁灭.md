    Brotherly Countries Warmly Celebrate Our National Day
    Andreyev Warns Aggressors at Moscow Rally
    The Military Strength of the Socialist Camp Surpasses Imperialism
    If the United States Launches a War Against China, It Will Inevitably Be Completely Destroyed
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 30th: More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Moscow held a grand rally at the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Palace on the evening of September 30th to celebrate China's National Day.

    Comrade Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, delivered a report at the meeting, issuing a warning to the American aggressors who are constantly intensifying their military provocations against China. He said that the countries of the socialist camp have stated more than once that they are militarily superior to imperialism. Therefore, the attempt of the American imperialists to intimidate people with their military force is hopeless. The American aggressors must get out of the Chinese territory they occupy. If they do not do so, if they launch a war against the People's China recklessly, then they will only accelerate their own complete destruction, and they will inevitably suffer the fate of Hitler.

    The celebration was jointly held by seven organizations and groups, including the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries under the Soviet Council of Ministers, the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association. Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, was invited to attend the meeting.

    Andreyev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Chairman of the Council of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, delivered a lengthy report to the meeting on China's National Day. He discussed the historical significance of the Chinese revolution and the tremendous achievements of China's socialist construction.

    Andreyev said that the glorious path taken by the Chinese people has enriched the theory and practice of socialist revolution and communist construction, and is an extremely rich experience for the entire international workers' movement and communist movement. Certain new forms and paths of the Chinese people building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party of China undoubtedly have international significance. He said that in the nine years of People's China, in terms of the speed of its political, economic, and cultural development, it has leapt into an advanced socialist country.

    Andreyev pointed out that the Chinese socialist revolution possesses such extraordinary strength and scale because there are three fundamental sources. The first source of this strength is the great, industrious, and intelligent Chinese people of more than 600 million. The second source is the existence of a powerful socialist camp. The third and most important source is that the Chinese people are led by the long-tested Communist Party, which has grown up in the fire of revolutionary struggle and the struggle against feudal, capitalist, and imperialist oppression. The source of the Party's strength is its constant and inseparable connection with the masses and the implementation of its measures through the masses. Another source of its strength is that its entire theory and practice are based on Marxism-Leninism. Correctly and creatively applying Marxism-Leninism under the specific conditions of China, as well as the spirit of internationalism and the irreconcilable spirit towards revisionism and dogmatism, is the source of the strength, courage, and determination with which the Communist Party of China leads the Chinese people on the socialist road.

    Andreyev said that the characteristic of the outstanding leadership methods of the Communist Party of China is to always move forward, not tolerate stagnation, and combine a sober assessment of the situation with a resolute shift from solving one task that has been put forward to solving another task. We Soviet Communists and all the Soviet people sincerely rejoice in the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and every achievement made by the Communist Party of China.

    Andreyev then condemned the aggressive actions and war threats of the American imperialists against China.

    Ambassador Liu Xiao then spoke at the meeting. He spoke about the achievements of China's socialist construction and the great leap forward of the Chinese people, about the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and thanked the Soviet government and people for their selfless assistance to China's socialist construction.

    Liu Xiao said that when American imperialism threatens our country with war, the Soviet people resolutely condemn the aggressors. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet people for this lofty internationalism and great brotherly friendship. The Chinese people will always stand with the Soviet people, always support each other, and continuously strengthen our great unity and great fighting friendship.

    欢呼我国伟大建设成就　反对美国在远东的战争挑衅
    兄弟国家热烈庆祝我国国庆
    安德烈耶夫在莫斯科集会上警告侵略者
    社会主义阵营军事力量超过帝国主义
    美国如对中国发动战争必遭彻底毁灭
    据新华社莫斯科30日电　莫斯科各界代表一千多人9月30日晚间在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行盛大集会，庆祝中国国庆。
    苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫同志在会上作报告时，对不断加紧对中国进行军事挑衅的美国侵略者提出了警告。他说，社会主义阵营国家不止一次地表明在军事上比帝国主义占优势。因此，美国帝国主义者想用自己的武力恫吓人的企图是没有希望的。美国侵略者必须从他们所占领的中国领土上滚出去。如果他们不这样做，如果他们不顾一切而对人民中国发动战争，那末，他们只会加速自己的彻底毁灭，他们将不可避免地遭到希特勒的命运。
    这次庆祝大会是由全苏工会中央理事会、苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会、苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会、苏联文化部、苏联部长会议国家对外文化委员会、苏联对外友好和文化协会联合会、苏中友好协会等七个组织和团体联合举行的。中国驻苏联大使刘晓应邀参加了大会。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员、苏共中央委员、苏中友好协会理事会主席安德烈耶夫向大会做了关于中国国庆的长篇报告。他论述了中国革命的历史意义和中国社会主义建设的巨大成就。
    安德烈耶夫说，中国人民所走过的光荣道路丰富了社会主义革命和共产主义建设的理论和实践，并且是整个国际工人运动和共产主义运动的极其丰富的经验。中国人民在中国共产党领导下建设社会主义的某些新形式和道路无疑地是具有国际意义的。他说，人民中国九年来就其政治、经济和文化发展的速度来说，已经跃进为先进的社会主义国家。
    安德烈耶夫指出，中国社会主义革命之所以具有如此非凡的力量和规模，这是因为有三个基本泉源。这种力量的第一个泉源是伟大的、六亿多的勤劳而智慧的中国人民。第二个泉源是强大的社会主义国家阵营的存在。第三个最重要的泉源是，领导中国人民的是久经考验的、在革命斗争和反封建、反资本主义和反帝国主义压迫的斗争的烈火中成长起来的共产党。党的力量的泉源是它同群众的经常而不可分割的联系以及通过群众来实行自己的措施。它的力量的另一个泉源就是它的全部理论和实践都以马克思列宁主义为基础。正确地和创造性地在中国的特定条件下运用马克思列宁主义以及国际主义精神和对修正主义和教条主义的不调和精神，这就是中国共产党领导中国人民走社会主义道路的那种力量、魄力和决心的泉源。
    安德烈耶夫说，中国共产党出色的领导方法的特点是，永远前进，不容忍停滞现象，结合对情况的清醒的估计，从解决一个已提出的任务坚决转向解决另一个任务。我们苏联共产党员和全体苏联人民衷心地为中国共产党的英明领导和中国共产党取得的每一个成就感到高兴。
    安德烈耶夫随后谴责美帝国主义者对中国的侵略行动和战争威胁。
    刘晓大使接着在会上讲了话。他谈到了中国社会主义建设和中国人民大跃进的成就，谈到了中苏两国人民的友谊，并且感谢苏联政府和人民对中国社会主义建设的无私援助。
    刘晓说，当美帝国主义以战争威胁我国的时候，苏联人民坚决谴责侵略者。中国人民对于苏联人民这种崇高的国际主义和伟大的兄弟情谊表示衷心的感谢。中国人民要和苏联人民永远站在一起，永远互相支持，不断加强我们之间的伟大团结和伟大的战斗友谊。
