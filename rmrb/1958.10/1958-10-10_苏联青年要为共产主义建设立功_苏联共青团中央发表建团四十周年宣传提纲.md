Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. TASS reports: October 29th this year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union. The Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol today published a propaganda outline for the 40th anniversary of its founding.

The outline points out that the Soviet Komsomol was born on the basis of the Russian proletariat's revolutionary struggle, and its founders were the great Soviet Communist Party and its leader V.I. Lenin. The Soviet Komsomol is the fighting assistant and reserve force of the Soviet Communist Party. Currently, the Komsomol, with 18 million members, is working on the front lines of building a communist society. It organizes and unites Soviet youth, and educates them to study, live, and work in a communist style.

The outline then discusses the outstanding contributions and meritorious deeds of the Soviet Komsomol in the struggle for socialist construction and defense of the socialist motherland over the past forty years. The outline points out that since the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the Komsomol has participated more actively in national, economic, and cultural construction. More than 700,000 Komsomol members and youth have been sent to various parts of the Soviet Union to participate in the construction of factories, mines, and hydroelectric power stations, and to reclaim wasteland. The Komsomol's participation in the reclamation of 36 million hectares of wasteland is a glorious page in the history of the Komsomol and a glorious page in the history of communist construction.

After the 13th Congress of the Soviet Komsomol held in April this year, participation in the construction of large enterprises, power stations, coal mines, and mines in the eastern, northern, and Donbass regions of the Soviet Union is one of the fighting tasks of Soviet youth. In addition, all rural Komsomol organizations are fighting to increase agricultural production.

The propaganda outline says that the Soviet Leninist Komsomol, led and nurtured by the Communist Party, has faithfully and wholeheartedly served the revolution for forty years. During this time, 67 million Soviet youth have been educated in its ranks. Contemporary Soviet youth have inherited the revolutionary traditions of the Party and the people and are fulfilling the great historical revolutionary mission. Never in any era has there been such a great leap forward and such great historical changes as those occurring today in the era of transition from capitalism to communism. The Soviet Leninist Komsomol is determined to write new and glorious chapters in the heroic cause of the Soviet people in building communism.

    苏联青年要为共产主义建设立功
    苏联共青团中央发表建团四十周年宣传提纲
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今年10月29日是苏联列宁共产主义青年团建立四十周年。苏联共青团中央委员会今天发表了建团四十周年的宣传提纲。
    提纲指出，苏联共青团是在俄国无产阶级革命斗争的基础上诞生的，它的创始者是伟大的苏联共产党和其领袖弗·伊·列宁。苏联共青团是苏联共产党的战斗助手和后备军。目前，拥有一千八百万团员的共青团正在建设共产主义社会的战线上进行着劳动，它组织和团结苏联青年，教育他们以共产主义的风格进行学习、生活和工作。
    提纲接着谈到了四十年来苏联共青团在社会主义建设和保卫社会主义祖国的斗争中所作出的卓越贡献和为祖国建立的功勋。提纲指出，在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，共青团更加积极地参加了国家、经济和文化建设。有七十多万共青团员和青年被派到苏联各地，参加工厂、矿山和水电站的建设，去开垦荒地。共青团参加开垦三千六百万公顷荒地这件事，是共青团历史中光辉的一页，是共产主义建设史中光辉的一页。
    在苏联共青团今年4月间举行第十三次代表大会以后，参加苏联东部、北部和顿巴斯地区的大企业、发电站、煤矿和矿山的建设是苏联青年的战斗任务之一。此外，所有农村共青团组织都在为增加农业生产而斗争。
    宣传提纲说，由共产党领导和哺育的苏联列宁共青团忠实地和全心全意地为革命服务已经四十年了。在这段时间里，六千七百万苏联青年在它的队伍里受到了教育。当代的苏联青年继承了党和人民的革命传统，正在完成伟大的历史的革命使命。在过去任何一个时代都没有发生过像今天由资本主义向共产主义过渡的时代中所发生的这样巨大的跃进和这样伟大的历史变化。苏联列宁共青团满怀决心要在苏联人民建设共产主义的英雄事业中写下新的光辉的篇章。
