Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 8th: The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a telephone conference on the evening of the 6th, deciding that the province should immediately mobilize four million people to form a professional army for deep plowing and soil improvement, plunging into the battle of deep plowing and soil improvement.

The Provincial Party Committee pointed out in the telephone conference: Deep plowing and soil improvement are the most important measures for striving for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. The experience of this year's late rice crop fully demonstrates that only on the basis of deep plowing and soil improvement can the role of various measures be fully utilized, allowing seedlings to grow densely and strongly. Therefore, deep plowing and soil improvement should be regarded as the most central task of agricultural capital construction this winter. The Provincial Party Committee also made the following regulations:

First, the province should immediately mobilize four million laborers to form a professional army for deep plowing and soil improvement, concentrating them in communes to immediately join the battle, contracting and taking responsibility for completing the tasks of deep plowing and soil improvement. This army will not stop working during the autumn harvest and will be expanded to six million people after the autumn harvest. Party committees at all levels should also organize deep plowing and soil improvement command headquarters to be responsible for commanding and ensuring the completion of the tasks.

Second, deep plowing and soil improvement should be carried out according to the following specifications: first, the depth of plowing should reach one foot; second, all land that has been deeply plowed must undergo soil improvement; third, combining deep plowing and soil improvement, layered fertilization should be carried out.

Third, there must be comprehensive planning. The land to be deeply plowed this year should mainly be the land that is to be planted with rice and important cash crops next year. Because Guangdong has already passed the hurdle of food this year, it plans to reduce the planting area of rice next year, focusing on improving the yield per unit area, so it is necessary to ensure that the land to be planted with rice next year has been deeply plowed and improved.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the deep plowing and soil improvement movement, the Provincial Party Committee called on party committees at all levels to establish and improve the leadership of the agricultural front while vigorously developing steel production. The secretary in charge of agriculture should immediately take command, and the Party Committee's office should also be divided into two teams, one to focus on industry and one to focus on agriculture. Secondly, arrangements and plans for the labor force should be made; various tasks should be lined up, and then war zones and labor forces should be divided according to contracted tasks. On the basis of contracting, labor organization should be actively improved and labor efficiency should be improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 7th: Various places in Shanxi Province have begun to rectify and improve the ranks of the steel army, establishing specialized and professional "field armies" for mining and smelting to ensure the further development of the steel industry.

In the past month, more than 2.2 million people in Shanxi Province have gone to various mountainous areas to participate in building furnaces, mining, and transporting ore. After day and night of hard work, the province's pig iron production has exceeded the 10,000-ton daily output mark. After a period of training, this steel army has largely mastered the techniques of iron smelting. However, they were originally organized to complete temporary shock tasks, and the manpower lacked reasonable allocation and overall planning. Some areas have seen an imbalance in the strength of the "five barriers" of mining, transportation, furnace construction, smelting, and coal mining.

Based on the practice of this period, various places in Shanxi began to vigorously rectify this steel army. They adjusted the manpower of the original mining, transportation, and smelting teams according to needs, and respectively established five more or less fixed professional teams for mining, transportation, furnace construction, coal mining, and smelting. Each professional team was organized into platoons and companies in a military-style organization and established cooperative relationships. After such rectification, the problem of furnaces not being able to be put into production quickly due to the shortage of ore and the lack of transportation in the early stage of the people's steel industry has been initially resolved.

The specialized and professional steel "field armies" now implement the five-fixed contract responsibility system of fixed leadership, fixed personnel, fixed time, fixed output, and fixed quality. Each mining point, each transportation line, and each furnace has a full-time cadre responsible for it, so labor efficiency has generally improved. In the past, Xiyang County needed 120 people to produce one ton of iron from mining and transportation to smelting, but now it only needs 68 people at most, and about 40 people at least. After the Taiyuan Steel Army implemented the five-fixed system, it has been able to free up a quarter of the labor force.

    组织专业军　调整劳动力
    广东将建四百万深翻军　山西整顿二百万钢铁军
    据新华社广州8日电　中共广东省委于6日晚召开电话会议，决定全省立即抽调四百万人，组成深翻土地和改良土壤的专业大军，投入深翻土地和改良土壤的战斗。
    省委在电话会议中指出：深翻土地、改良土壤是争取明年农业生产更大跃进的最重要的措施。今年晚造的经验充分说明，只有在深翻土地、改良土壤的基础上，才能充分发挥各项措施的作用，使禾苗长得既密又壮。因此，应把深翻土地、改良土壤作为今冬农业基本建设最中心的任务。省委并作了如下几项规定：
    第一，全省要立即抽调四百万个劳动力，组成一支深翻土地和改良土壤的专业大军，以公社为单位集中起来，马上投入战斗，包干负责完成深翻土地和改良土壤的任务。这支大军秋收时也不停止工作，秋收后还要扩大到六百万人。各级党委也要组织深翻土地和改良土壤指挥部，负责进行指挥，保证任务的完成。
    第二，深翻土地和改良土壤要按下列的规格进行：首先是深翻要达一尺；其次是所有经过深翻的土地，都必须经过改良土壤；再次是结合深翻土地和改良土壤，要进行分层施肥。
    第三，要有全面的规划。今年深翻的土地，主要的应该是那些明年准备种植水稻和重要经济作物的土地。广东由于今年粮食问题已经过关，明年准备减缩水稻种植面积，着重提高单位面积产量，因此要保证明年种植水稻的土地，都经过深翻和改良土壤。
    为了加强对深翻、改良土壤运动的领导，省委号召各级党委在大抓钢铁的同时，要建立和健全农业战线的领导。负责管农业的书记要立即挂帅，同时，党委的办公室也要分成两个班子，一个抓工业，一个抓农业。其次，要作好劳动力的安排和规划；要把各项任务进行排队，然后按任务包干划分战线和分配劳动力，在包干的基础上，积极改善劳动组织和提高劳动效率。
    据新华社太原7日电　山西省各地开始整顿和健全钢铁大军的队伍，建立采矿、冶炼等专职专业的“野战军”，以保证钢铁工业的进一步发展。
    近一个月来，山西全省已经有二百二十多万人开赴各个山区，参加建炉、采矿、运矿石。经过日夜苦战，全省生铁已经突破日产万吨大关。这支钢铁大军经过这一段时间的锻炼，大都初步掌握了炼铁技术。但是，他们原来大都是为完成临时突击任务而组织起来的，人力缺乏合理调配和统筹安排，有些地区已出现采矿、运输、建炉、冶炼、挖煤“五关”力量不平衡的现象。
    根据这个时期的实践，山西各地就开始来着手大力整顿这一支钢铁大军。他们把原有的采矿、运输、冶炼等队伍的人力根据需要作了调整，分别建立起采矿、运输、建炉、采煤、冶炼五支大体固定的专业队伍，各个专业队伍都按军事化的组织编成班排连，并建立了协作关系。经过这样的整顿，全民办钢铁工业初期存在的因矿石少、运输跟不上而造成炉子不能迅速投入生产的问题，现在已经初步得到解决。
    各个专职专业的钢铁“野战军”，现在都实行了定领导、定人员、定时间、定产量、定质量的五定包干负责制度，每一个矿点、每一个运输线、每一个炉子，都有专职干部负责，因此劳动效率普遍提高。昔阳县过去每出一吨铁，从采矿、运输到冶炼需要一百二十个人，现在最多的只要六十八个人，少的四十个人左右就可以了。太原市钢铁大军实行五定以后，已经可以腾出四分之一的劳动力。
