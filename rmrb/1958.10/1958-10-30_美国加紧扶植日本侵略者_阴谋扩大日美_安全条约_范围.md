　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Sources well-informed at the Japanese Jiji Press reported that the United States has proposed to Japan to expand the scope of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," which is currently under revision, to the entire Western Pacific region, including Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, which are important U.S. military bases.

　　These sources said that the U.S. side believes that in order to revise the current "Security Treaty" to give Japan "equal say" in "bilateral defense arrangements," expanding the treaty's applicable area is "logical."

　　The U.S. and Japan have already held two official talks on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on October 4th and 22nd. On the 28th, the Vice Minister of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Hisanari Yamada, also held preparatory talks with the U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo, Douglas MacArthur II.

　　The Kishi Nobusuke government has long expressed its intention to include Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands within the U.S.-Japan "joint defense area" in order to realize the U.S. conspiracy to organize an anti-communist alliance of Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, and to achieve the Kishi Nobusuke government's goal of reviving Japanese aggressive forces.

　　The news revealed that the Kishi Nobusuke government is concerned that the U.S. proposal will provoke opposition from Japanese public opinion, and that the Japanese constitution prohibits Japan from sending troops abroad.

    美国加紧扶植日本侵略者
    阴谋扩大日美“安全条约”范围
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：据日本时事通讯社消息灵通人士透露，美国已经向日本提出，要把正在修改中的日美“安全条约”的适用范围扩大到整个西太平洋地区，其中包括美国重要军事基地冲绳和小笠原群岛。
    这些人士说，美国方面认为，要把现行的“安全条约”修改为使日本在“双边的防卫安排”中有“平等的发言权”，扩大条约的适用地区是“合乎逻辑的”。
    日美双方已经在10月4日和22日就修改日美“安全条约”的问题举行了两次正式会谈。日本外务省次官山田久就在28日又同美国驻东京大使麦克阿瑟第二进行了准备性的会谈。
    岸信介政府早已表示要把冲绳和小笠原群岛包括在日美“共同防御地区”之内，以便实现美国组织日本、李承晚、蒋介石反共联盟的阴谋，并且达到岸信介政府复活日本侵略势力的目的。
    消息透露，岸信介政府担心美国的建议将引起日本公众舆论的反对，并且日本宪法禁止日本派兵出国。
