Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: The Ministry of Light Industry held an on-site conference on the comprehensive utilization of potatoes in southern provinces in Chen County Special District, Hunan Province, from the 10th to the 14th, requesting light industry departments in various regions to quickly mobilize, rely on Party committees, and fully mobilize the masses to make good use of the abundant sweet potato harvest this year.

This year, southern provinces have generally had bumper sweet potato harvests. Sichuan is expected to harvest 100 billion jin, and Hunan is expected to harvest 80 billion jin. Since it cannot all be consumed, it must be comprehensively utilized. The conference pointed out that sweet potatoes can not only be made into delicious foods, but also used as feed, and can also be refined into fuel for machines and raw materials for industry. To make good comprehensive use of sweet potatoes, it is necessary to implement a technological revolution and improve processing capacity. The conference believed that the hydraulic automated universal processing plant in Yongxing County and the animal-powered turntable sweet potato processing machine in Xiangyin County can not only handle sweet potatoes well, but also process other agricultural products. The hydraulic automated universal processing plants in Yongxing Wuxing People's Commune and Hongqi People's Commune are mostly made of wood. Relying on hydraulic power, they carry out sweet potato washing, transportation, grinding, filtration, and starch production. At the same time, they can also drive two rasping machines and slicing machines. With only four people operating, they can process 150,000 jin of sweet potatoes per day. Similar factories can be built according to local conditions in vast rural areas, especially where water resources are abundant or where there is a lot of animal power. The alcohol tower for refining alcohol from sweet potatoes in Yongxing Hongqi People's Commune is made of ceramic, the pipes are made of bamboo, and the condenser and condenser pipes are made of glass. These methods can be imitated everywhere. If rural industries across the country effectively utilize water resources and natural energy, they can save tens of millions of labor force and a lot of steel every year.

The conference believes that the light industry system must now pay attention to the industrial construction of people's communes. The industrial construction of people's communes should be comprehensively arranged according to the urgent needs of industry and agriculture. Factories must implement diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of raw materials to make products diverse, inexpensive, and beautiful to meet the needs of commune members. The industrial construction of communes should combine decentralization and centralization, large-scale and small-scale, and mechanical operation with appropriate manual labor. The conference pointed out that the basic construction work of light industry in the future will mainly be carried out within the people's communes, so everyone should pay attention to the industrial construction of the communes.

### 实行技术革命提高加工能力  把薯类综合利用好

    实行技术革命提高加工能力
    把薯类综合利用好
    新华社长沙18日电　轻工业部10日到14日在湖南省郴县专区召开南方各省薯类综合利用现场会议，要求各地轻工业部门迅速动员起来，依靠党委，充分发动群众，利用好今年大面积丰收的红薯。
    今年南方各省红薯普遍大丰收，预计四川可收一千亿斤，湖南可收八百亿斤，食用不了，必须加以综合利用。会议指出，红薯不但可以制作美味的食品，也可以作为饲料，还可以提炼机器用的燃料和作为工业用的原料。要把红薯综合利用好，必须实行技术革命，提高加工能力。会议认为湖南永兴县的水力自动化万能加工厂，湘阴县的畜力转盘红薯加工机，不仅可以很好地处理红薯，而且可以加工其他农产品。永兴五星人民公社和红旗人民公社的水力自动化万能加工厂，大部分是木质的，它依靠水力冲动，进行洗薯、运薯、磨粉、过滤和制造淀粉，同时还能带动两部刨丝机、切片机，只要四个人操作，一天能处理十五万斤红薯。在广大农村特别是水力资源充足的地方或者畜力多的地方，都可以根据当地情况，建设类似的工厂。永兴红旗人民公社用红薯提炼酒精的酒精塔是陶瓷做的，管子是用竹子制的，分凝器和冷凝器管子是用玻璃制的，这些办法各地都可仿效。如果全国农村工业有效地发挥水力资源和天然能的能力，一年就可以节约几千万个劳力和不少钢铁。
    会议认为，轻工业系统现在必须重视人民公社的工业建设。人民公社的工业建设，应当根据工农业的迫切需要，全面安排，工厂必须实行多种经营和对原料的综合利用，做到产品多样又价廉物美，以满足社员的需要。公社的工业建设，应做到分散与集中相结合，大型与小型相结合，机械操作与适当的手工劳动相结合。会议指出，今后轻工业的基本建设工作，主要的是在人民公社内进行，因此大家都应当重视公社的工业建设。
