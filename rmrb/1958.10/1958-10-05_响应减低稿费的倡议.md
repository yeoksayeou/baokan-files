    After reading the initiative by comrades Zhang Tianyi, Zhou Libo, and Ai Wu regarding the suggestion to reduce manuscript fees, we deeply sympathize. In the current situation of the Great Leap Forward, the creations and inventions of the workers and peasants are increasing, all of which can increase production by several times, even tens, hundreds, and tens of thousands of times. If we compare the work and remuneration of intellectuals with the contributions and treatment of workers and peasants, it can be clearly seen that the intellectuals receive much higher remuneration. This problem is particularly prominent in the manuscript fees received by writers and translators.

    Currently, the manuscript fee standards of various newspapers and periodicals in Beijing are generally too high, which is an unreasonable phenomenon. The existence of this phenomenon will inevitably contribute to the breeding of bourgeois ideology, making them regard themselves as special, despise physical labor, and thus deepen the opposition between mental and physical labor.

    Excessive manuscript fees are also detrimental to work and the progress of intellectuals, and are extremely incompatible with the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward. It seems that reducing or even abolishing manuscript fees is also an inevitable trend in social development.

    We fully agree with the initiative of the three writers. The phenomenon of excessively high manuscript fees should be corrected immediately. The manuscript fee standards of various newspapers and periodicals in Beijing should be greatly reduced, and the standards for paying manuscript fees in major and medium-sized cities across the country should also be adjusted according to this spirit.

    响应减低稿费的倡议
    读了张天翼、周立波、艾芜三位同志关于建议减低稿费报酬的倡议之后，我们深有同感。在目前大跃进的形势下，工农群众的创造和发明越来越多，都是能提高生产几倍以至几十、几百和上万倍的。如果把知识分子做的工作和拿的报酬，和工农群众的贡献和待遇比一比，就可以很明显看出，知识分子所拿的报酬高得多。这个问题在作家、翻译家所拿的稿费报酬上表现得特别突出。
    目前，北京各报刊的稿费标准一般都过高，这是一个不合理现象。这个现象的存在，必然会助长资产阶级思想的滋生，使他们自视特殊，轻视体力劳动，从而加深了脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立。
    稿费过高，对工作、对知识分子的进步，也都是不利的，同全国大跃进的形势是极不相适应的。看来减低稿酬以至取消稿酬也是社会发展的必然趋势。
    我们完全赞同三位作家的倡议，稿酬过高的现象应立即纠正，北京各报刊的稿费报酬标准应该大大减低，全国各大中城市支付稿酬的标准也应根据这样的精神来调整。
