Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Tokyo dispatch: The National Convention for Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Banning Nuclear Armament, held in Tokyo, unanimously passed a resolution on the evening of the 28th, resolutely opposing all attempts to drag Japan back to dark politics and conspiracies to launch war against China, and strongly demanding that American troops withdraw from Japan, China's Taiwan, and the Taiwan Strait area.

The resolution opposes revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and concluding a Japan-U.S. "Mutual Defense Treaty," demanding the abolition of the "Security Treaty" and striving for Japan's complete independence, and opposing the transportation of nuclear weapons into Japan and demanding the cessation of nuclear armament of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

The resolution opposes the Kishi Nobusuke government's malicious revision of the Japanese Constitution and sending Japanese soldiers abroad, and opposes the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and the enactment of an "Anti-Espionage Law."

The resolution demands that the Kishi Nobusuke government abolish the "Japan-Chiang Treaty" and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and demands that it stop its conspiracy to organize a military alliance between Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

The convention also passed a special resolution on the Okinawa issue. The resolution pointed out that due to the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Okinawa may become the central point of the Japan-Rhee-Chiang military alliance. The resolution strongly opposes the United States' attempt to annex Okinawa and demands that the United States immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa to Japan.

The declaration passed by the convention pointed out that Japan's democracy and Asian peace are facing the biggest crisis since the war. The declaration called on all the Japanese people to put the overall interests first, unite, and resolutely fight to the end against the conspiracy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, the enemy of peace, to revive dark politics.

The convention passed the current movement guidelines. The guidelines stipulate the establishment of centers for opening Sino-Japanese relations or peace movement centers in various prefectures, counties, cities, towns, and villages in Japan, as well as workplaces. At the same time, various gatherings on opening Sino-Japanese relations should be organized, and the movement of one million people wearing badges symbolizing the demand for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations on their chests should be promoted. It also demands that local assemblies at all levels pass resolutions at the end-of-year regular meetings demanding the immediate restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Tokyo dispatch: Under the auspices of the "National Conference Against the Revision of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law," representatives from more than sixty organizations in Japan held a meeting in Tokyo today and decided to designate November 5th as the "National Unified Action Day Against the Revision of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law" to launch a large-scale mass struggle.

The organizations participating in the meeting included the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the Writers' Association, the All-Japan Youth and Women's Conference, the Women's Agreement for the Protection of Human Rights, the Christian Women's Temperance Association, and the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.

Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution Chairman Katayama Tetsu, "Sohyo" Secretary-General Iwai Akira, and cultural figures such as Yoko Matsuoka spoke at the meeting, reporting on the recent situation of the struggle against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law."

The representative of the Women's Agreement for the Protection of Human Rights reported that the Women's Agreement would organize a "Grand March of Mothers and Women" of more than 1,500 people to participate in the unified struggle on November 5th. Famous actress Kishida Kyoko expressed that many cultural figures and artists are organizing marching teams to prepare to participate in the struggle on that day.

The meeting unanimously passed a statement strongly demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party abolish the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" and calling on all organizations and individuals who love peace and democracy to rise up together on November 5th to launch protest struggles.

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Tokyo dispatch: The Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting in Tokyo today and decided to resolutely oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to extend the session of the extraordinary Diet in order to forcibly pass the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment," which is unanimously opposed by the people of Japan.

The meeting decided that the Socialist Party would completely concentrate its struggle on the issue of overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet in the final stage of the extraordinary Diet session. Therefore, the meeting decided to successively submit motions of no confidence against Aoki Tadashi, Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, Natae Hirokichi, Minister of Education, and Sato Gisuke, Director-General of the "Defense Agency," before and after November 5th, and then submit a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The meeting also decided to strengthen the struggle outside the Diet. Leading cadres such as the Chairman of the Socialist Party will participate in debate speeches to be held in five locations, including Kobe and Yokohama. (Attached photo)
