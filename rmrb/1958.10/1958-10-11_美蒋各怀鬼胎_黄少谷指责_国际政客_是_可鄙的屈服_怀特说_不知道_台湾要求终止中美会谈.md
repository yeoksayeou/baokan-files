Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Taipei dispatch: Taiwan authority's "Foreign Minister" Huang Shao-gu delivered a speech on the evening of the 9th, fiercely attacking the "deals" of "international politicians," saying their behavior was "despicable capitulation."

In this speech, Huang Shao-gu mentioned that "some people are now advocating" that the Chiang Kai-shek clique should hand over the coastal islands in exchange for a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait. He also said that "some hints have been heard about neutralizing or demilitarizing these islands," and some people "suggested that any ceasefire arrangement" should include the Chiang Kai-shek clique "withdrawing or reducing troops stationed on these islands." Huang Shao-gu said that all those making these suggestions were taking an "irresponsible attitude," "lacked understanding of the basic facts or key issues involved," and were "cowardly people" who "trembled at every attack." He stated that the Taiwan authorities "resolutely opposed" "neutralization or demilitarization" "in any form."

He also opposed bringing the coastal islands issue to the United Nations for "vague discussions." He said that there were "some selfish international politicians who, in order to appease or please the communist bloc, would not hesitate to abandon moral and legal principles" and "engage in any possible open or secret deals." He said, "The United Nations should not become a stock exchange." He declared that the Taiwan authorities were "not bound by any arrangements detrimental to their interests, whether within or outside the United Nations."

Huang Shao-gu did not specifically name who was making these proposals, referring to them generally as "international politicians." However, as previously reported, US Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference on September 30th, also said, while touting the US "ceasefire" plot, that if there was a "reliable ceasefire," the Chiang Kai-shek clique should withdraw some troops from the coastal islands. Dulles also mentioned that the United States might bring this issue to the United Nations in the future. Dulles also denounced the Chiang Kai-shek clique's concentration of large numbers of troops on the coastal islands as "stupid."

Huang Shao-gu's speech also defended this point, saying that these troops had been sent gradually since 1949.

More than thirty organizations controlled by the Taiwan authorities also jointly wrote a letter to US President Eisenhower on the same day, calling on the United States to "terminate the Warsaw talks" and expressing opposition to "any reduction" of Chiang's troops in Jinmen and other places.

News from Washington said that US State Department spokesman White told reporters on the 9th that he "did not know" that the Chiang Kai-shek clique had requested the United States to suspend the Warsaw talks, and he had "not received" any "news from" the Chiang Kai-shek clique "accusing the communists of massively concentrating troops on the mainland."

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Washington dispatch: US State Department spokesman White stated at a press conference on the 9th that the US government would adhere to its aggressor stance of interfering in China's internal affairs and continue to play the bankrupt "ceasefire" conspiracy.

White announced: The United States will demand China at today's eighth meeting of the Warsaw talks to "extend" the deadline for ceasing the bombardment of Jinmen, despite the Chinese government's solemn declaration that how long the Chinese army ceases the bombardment of Jinmen is purely China's internal affair, and the Americans have no right to interfere at all. White also said that the "entire purpose" of the US holding Warsaw talks with China was to "promote a ceasefire." This statement fundamentally distorted the mission of the Sino-US talks, which is to discuss and resolve the issue of withdrawing all US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, thereby eliminating the source of tension in the Taiwan Strait area.

    美蒋各怀鬼胎
    黄少谷指责“国际政客”是“可鄙的屈服”
    怀特说“不知道”台湾要求终止中美会谈
    新华社10日讯　台北消息：台湾当局的“外交部长”黄少谷在9日晚上发表了一篇演说，猛烈地指责“国际政客们”的“交易”，说他们的行为是“可鄙的屈服”。
    黄少谷在这篇演说里谈到，“现在已有些人主张”为在台湾海峡“停火”蒋介石集团应交出沿海岛屿。他还说，“也听到一些暗示想使此等岛屿中立化或非军事化”，有些人“又建议任何停火的安排”里要蒋介石集团“撤退或减少驻在这些岛屿的部队”。黄少谷说，所有作这些建议的人是采取“不负责任的态度”，是“对有关的基本事实或关键问题缺乏认识”，是因“每一袭击而战栗”的“怯懦的人”。他表示，台湾当局“断然反对”“不论出以任何形式”的“中立化或非军事化”。
    他也反对把沿海岛屿问题提到联合国作“含糊讨论”。他说，有“一些自私自利的国际政客，他们为了姑息或取悦共产集团，会毫不犹豫地放弃道义的及法律的原则”，“从事任何可能的公开或秘密的买卖”。他说，“联合国不应成为交易所”。他声明台湾当局“不受任何有损其利益的安排之约束，无论是联合国之内或之外的安排均属相同。”
    黄少谷没有具体指明是那些人提出这些主张的，他泛泛说是“国际政客们”。但是，前已报道，美国国务卿杜勒斯9月30日在记者招待会上鼓吹美国的“停火”阴谋时也是说过，如果有了“可靠的停火”，蒋介石集团就应从沿海岛屿撤退一部分军队。杜勒斯并且谈到美国以后可能要把这个问题提到联合国。杜勒斯还斥骂蒋介石集团在沿海岛屿集结大量兵力是“愚蠢”的。
    黄少谷的演说在这一点上也作了辩护，他说，这些兵力集结是从1949年陆续派去的。
    台湾当局控制的三十几个团体也在同一天联名写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，呼吁美国“终止华沙会谈”，并表示反对“任何裁减”金门等地蒋军。
    从华盛顿传来的消息说，美国国务院发言人怀特在9日对新闻记者说，他“不知道”蒋介石集团要求美国中断华沙会谈，他也“并没有接到”蒋介石集团“指责共产党人在大陆大量集结兵力的消息”。
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特9日在记者招待会上表明，美国政府将坚持它干涉中国内政的侵略者的立场，继续玩弄已经破产的“停火”阴谋。
    怀特宣布：美国将在今天华沙会谈的第八次会议上要求中国“延长”停止炮击金门的期限，尽管中国政府已经严正声明，中国军队停止炮击金门多久，纯粹是中国内政问题，美国人根本无权过问。怀特并且说，美国同中国举行华沙会谈的“全部目的”就是“促成停火”。这一声明根本歪曲了中美会谈的任务，这就是讨论和解决从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤退一切美国武装力量从而消除台湾海峡地区紧张局势的根源问题。
