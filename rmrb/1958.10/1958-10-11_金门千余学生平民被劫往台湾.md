Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to an Associated Press report from Kinmen, the Chiang Kai-shek clique kidnapped approximately 1,100 civilians from Kinmen Island to Taiwan on the 9th. Among those kidnapped were 964 students and 45 teachers from Kinmen High School, and about 100 other civilians.

The report stated that all the middle school students and teachers from Kinmen Island who were kidnapped were only informed five hours before being forced onto the Chiang military landing craft that they were being forcibly taken to Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek clique also forbade their parents from seeing them off at the beach. The report revealed that these middle school teachers and students were all "agitated" by the forced kidnapping. When they were ordered onto the landing craft by Chiang Kai-shek's naval personnel, the order was so chaotic that several girls and their luggage fell down.

Associated Press said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique recently also intends to kidnap all of the more than 5,700 civilians on Lesser Kinmen Island to Taiwan. Registration work is currently underway before the kidnapping.

    金门千余学生平民被劫往台湾
    新华社10日讯　据美联社金门消息，蒋介石集团在9日把约一千一百名金门岛上的平民劫往台湾。被劫走的平民中，包括金门中学的九百六十四名学生、四十五名教师和约一百名其他平民。
    消息说，被劫走的金门岛上全部中学生和教师，在被驱押上蒋军登陆艇以前的五小时才接到强迫去台湾的通知。蒋介石集团还禁止他们的父母到海滩送行。消息透露，这些中学师生对于被强迫劫运情绪上都“感到激动”。当他们被蒋介石海军人员喝令登上登陆艇的时候秩序十分混乱，以致有好几个女孩子同行李一起掉下去。
    美联社说，蒋介石集团最近还打算把小金门岛上的五千七百多名平民全部劫运到台湾去。目前正在进行劫运前的登记工作。
