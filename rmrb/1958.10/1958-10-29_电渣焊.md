    Electroslag welding, also known as molten slag welding, is a welding method for thick sections completed in a single pass. It is a relatively new technology that has emerged worldwide in recent years. The metal thickness and weight that can be welded using this method are virtually unlimited. In situations where equipment conditions are limited and large castings or forgings cannot be made, large components can be divided into several smaller components and welded into a single unit using the electroslag welding method. This method opens up a new path for the design and manufacturing of heavy machinery.

    The simple principle of electroslag welding is to create a molten slag pool between the workpieces to be welded and specially made sliders. Current passes from the electrode through the molten slag to the workpieces, thereby heating the molten slag and maintaining its high conductivity. The temperature of the molten slag pool is much higher than the melting points of the workpieces and the electrode, causing the electrode to turn into droplets and merge with the molten edges of the workpieces to form a metal pool. Thus, as the electrode is continuously fed in, the molten slag pool and the metal pool gradually rise, and the metal pool below gradually solidifies, forming a weld that connects the workpieces into a single unit.

    A single electrode can weld metal approximately sixty millimeters thick. If the electrode is reciprocated in the thickness direction of the workpiece, thick sections of one hundred fifty to two hundred millimeters can be welded. By increasing the number of electrodes, workpieces of any thickness can be welded.

    As the power of modern machines continues to grow, machine parts are often made of very large and thick castings or forgings. The larger the size and weight of the parts, the more complex the manufacturing process, and the more difficult it becomes to achieve uniform consistency in the metal of the castings and forgings. In addition, large castings and forgings can only be manufactured manually, resulting in low production efficiency and requiring giant specialized equipment. Electroslag welding can be used to combine several small and medium-sized casting and forging units into cast and forged structures of any shape and size. This "divide and conquer" approach greatly simplifies production, reduces the requirements for equipment conditions, and enables factories without heavy blank manufacturing equipment to manufacture heavy blanks using welding methods.

    电渣焊
    电渣焊又叫熔渣焊，是一种在一次行程中焊接厚断面的电焊方法，它是世界上最近几年才出现的一种新技术。这种焊接方法可焊的金属厚度和重量实际上是无限制的。在设备条件受到限制，做不了大型铸锻件的情况下，都可以把大件分为若干小型件用电渣焊方法焊接成为一个整体。这种方法给重型机器设计和制造开辟了一个新的道路。
    电渣焊的简单道理是在要焊的工件和特制的滑块之间构成熔渣池，电流由焊条经过熔渣通到焊件上，从而加热熔渣，使熔渣保持高度的导电性。熔渣池的温度比焊件和焊条的熔点高出很多，因而使焊条变成熔滴于熔化的焊件边缘连成金属熔池。这样，连续送入焊条，熔渣池和金属熔池逐渐上升，下面的金属熔池逐渐凝固，形成把工件连成一个整体的焊缝。
    一根焊条能焊接约六十公厘厚的金属，如果使焊条在工件厚度方面往复移动，就能焊接一百五十至二百公厘的厚断面。增加焊条数目，就可以焊接任意厚度的工件。
    现代机器的功率不断增长，机器零件常用很大很厚的铸件或锻件制成，零件的尺寸和重量愈大，制成过程越复杂，铸件锻件金属也越难均匀一致。此外，大型铸锻件只能用手工制造，生产效率很低，而且需要巨型的特殊设备。用电渣焊就可以由几个中小型铸锻件的单元并成任何形状和尺寸的铸锻件结构。这种化大为小的做法就大大地简化了生产，降低了对设备条件的要求，使没有重型毛胚制造设备的工厂也能用焊接方法制造出重型毛胚。
