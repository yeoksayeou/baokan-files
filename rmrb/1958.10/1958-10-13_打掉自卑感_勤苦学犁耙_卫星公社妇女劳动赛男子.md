    Overcoming Inferiority Complex, Diligently Learning to Plow and Harrow:
    Satellite Commune Women's Labor Competition Surpasses Men

    (Reported by this newspaper) Jiangxi Province, Gao'an County, Satellite People's Commune female commune members, with the majority of male labor force being drawn away for steel production, demonstrated revolutionary spirit, diligently studied, and excellently completed field work. In the recent agricultural production evaluation organized by the entire county, Satellite Commune gloriously won the "Upstream" Red Flag.

    Satellite Commune is a large commune with over ten thousand households, possessing over one hundred thousand mu of paddy and dry land. The entire commune's over eighteen thousand full and semi-laborers are burdened with an average of more than five mu of cultivated land per person, and among them, nine thousand four hundred male laborers have always been the main force of production. Although women have the habit of labor, the majority can only engage in supplementary labor. In order to engage in steel production, over eight thousand male laborers were transferred on September 10th, and another one thousand male laborers also participated in supporting steel production by burning charcoal and transporting materials. At this time, in the entire commune, apart from the small team leader and accountant in each team who were men, the rest who remained to engage in agricultural production were all women. At this time, agricultural production was at a critical juncture. Over sixteen thousand mu of late rice in the entire commune were suffering from severe drought threats, two thousand eight hundred mu of third-class seedlings had to be urgently top-dressed with fertilizer, and over eighteen thousand mu of autumn fields also had to be plowed in preparation for autumn planting. In addition, dry crops such as cotton, sesame, and sweet potatoes also had to be managed and harvested in a timely manner. Whether it was possible to not delay agricultural production in the face of difficulties, and who to rely on to improve agricultural production, became a serious problem. Initially, the production team leaders did not quite believe in the strength of women, and proposed "to go up the mountains to make steel, not stay at home to lead a bunch of women." Some even said: "Relying solely on these women, we cannot be responsible if production suffers!" As for the women, many had an inferiority complex, feeling that they could not shoulder such a heavy burden of production.

    Based on this ideological situation, the commune Party committee immediately convened a meeting of production team leaders and women representatives to organize a debate on why to vigorously engage in steel production? Could women shoulder the important task of agricultural production after the men left? During the debate, everyone first recognized the great significance of steel production, and that drawing the labor force back was not feasible. Therefore, many women proposed to boldly break superstitions and first overcome the idea of looking down on themselves. They said: Men were not born knowing everything either, we will learn what we don't know, and there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome through hard study and hard work. Some women who were skilled in plowing and harrowing also introduced their experiences. Under the leadership of the Party committee, everyone boosted their energy and immediately took action. Commune members assigned to fight the drought tinkled and clanked and installed ball bearings on all the waterwheels in one night, and started a day and night battle to draw water to fight the drought. The Solidarity Brigade wanted to draw water from the dam behind the mountain, but opening a canal required over a thousand workdays, and both labor and time did not allow it. All thirty-eight women in the team concentrated nineteen waterwheels and connected them together, drawing water over the mountain to rescue the seedlings. The battle persisted for a day and a night, and they were not willing to get off the wheels to rest. The female commune members storming the field management were even less willing to fall behind, sending fertilizer and top-dressing in the fields day and night, and eliminating two thousand five hundred mu of third-class seedlings in less than five days. In late September, some areas received rain, and the autumn crop harvest was already set. At this time, apart from a small portion of the labor force harvesting cotton and sesame, the majority of the labor force returned to plowing the fields for autumn planting. The master teaches the apprentice, three in a group in the field, five in a bunch, diligently teaching and practicing hard. The women who were newly learning to plow and harrow initially found it particularly difficult. They would get sore hands and arms after walking only a short distance, and the quality was not up to standard, but none were discouraged. If one pass didn't work, they would do another. Persisting in hard study and hard practice in this way, in less than a few days, all seven thousand women participating in plowing and harrowing mastered the technology, greatly accelerating the progress of autumn plowing and autumn planting. The Jiangshang small team of the Meikou Brigade originally allocated three days to complete the plowing of sixty mu of land. Initially, the small team leader was unwilling to accept the task, but all twenty-six women in the team completed it in only two and a half days.

    The male commune members fighting on the steel front, hearing that production at home was not delayed, all praised the women for their drive and resourcefulness, saying that they could rest assured.

    Now the late rice is ripening soon, and the even busier task of autumn harvest and autumn planting is coming again. The women are already prepared to resolutely ensure that harvesting and planting are done simultaneously, and done well, even if not a single person is transferred back from the iron smelting base.

    打掉自卑感　勤苦学犁耙
    卫星公社妇女劳动赛男子
    本报讯　江西省高安县卫星人民公社妇女社员在绝大部分男劳动力被抽走搞钢铁的情况下，发挥革命干劲，苦学苦干，出色地完成了田间作业。在最近全县组织的农业生产评比中，卫星社光荣的获得了“上游”红旗。
    卫星社是个一万多户的大社，共有十万多亩水田和旱地，全社一万八千多个整、半劳动力平均每人负担五亩多耕地，而其中九千四百多个男劳力一向是生产的主力。妇女虽有劳动习惯，但大部分只能从事附带劳动。为了搞钢铁生产，9月10日有八千多个男劳力被调走了，另一千个男劳力也参加了烧木炭、运输等支援钢铁的工作。这时，全社留下搞农业生产的，除每个队的小队长和会计是男人以外，其余都是妇女了。这个时候，农业生产正值紧要关头。全社一万六千多亩晚稻遭受严重的旱灾威胁，有二千八百亩三类禾苗必须抓紧追肥，一万八千多亩秋田也要翻耕准备秋种。另外棉花、芝麻、红薯等旱作物还要管理和及时收、摘。在困难面前能不能做到不误农业生产，依靠谁来搞好农业生产，成了严重的问题。开始生产队长们不大相信妇女的力量，提出“要上山搞钢铁，不在家领导一群婆娘”。甚至说：“光靠这些妇女，生产受到损失不负责！”妇女呢，许多人有自卑感，认为搞生产这么重的担子担不起。
    根据这种思想状况，公社党委会立即召开了生产队长和妇女代表会议，就为什么要大闹钢铁？男人走了妇女能不能担当农业生产的重任？组织了辩论。辩论中，大家首先认识到钢铁生产的重大意义，若把劳动力抽回来是不行的，因此，许多妇女提出了要大胆破除迷信，首先打掉自己看不起自己的思想。她们说：男人也不是天生下来就样样会做的，我们不会的就学，苦学苦干没有克服不了的困难。一些能犁会耙的妇女并且介绍了自己的经验。在党委会的领导下，人人鼓足干劲立即行动起来。分配抗旱的社员叮叮当当一个晚上就把全部水车装上了滚珠，开始日夜车水大战旱灾。团结大队要引山背后的坝水，但开一条圳需千多个工，劳力和时间都不允许，全队三十八个妇女便集中了十九部水车连接起来，引水过山抢救禾苗，战斗坚持到一天一夜，还不肯下车休息。突击田间管理的女社员更不甘落后，日夜在田间送肥追肥，不到五天即消灭了二千五百亩三类禾苗。9月下旬部分地区落了雨，秋季作物丰收已成定局。这时除少部分劳力收棉花、芝麻以外，大部分劳力又转上了翻田秋种。师傅带徒弟，田里三个一群，五个一伙，勤教苦练。新学犁耙的妇女开始学习特别吃力，走不多远就扎得手酸臂痛，质量也不够标准，但没一个灰心，一道不行就再来一道。这样坚持苦学苦练，不到几天时间参加犁田耙田的七千名妇女就全部掌握了技术，大大加快了秋耕秋种的进度。梅口大队江上小队原来分配三天完成六十亩田的翻耕任务，最初小队长不肯接受，但全队二十六个妇女只用了两天半就完成了。
    战斗在钢铁前线的男社员们听到家里生产没有误事，都称赞妇女们有干劲，有办法，说他们可以放下心了。
    现在晚稻快熟了，更繁忙的秋收秋种任务又到来了。妇女们已经准备即使不从炼铁基地调回一个人来，也要坚决做到随收随种，收好种好。　（马锺明）（附图片）
