    苏联建议美英举行三国外长会议
    商讨缔结永远停止试验核武器协定
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科1日电：苏联政府1日正式建议苏联、美国和英国外交部长就停止核武器试验问题于10月31日在日内瓦举行会议。
    苏联的这个建议是在苏联政府给美国政府的复照中提出的。两份同样内容的照会已由苏联外交部于10月1日交给美国和英国驻莫斯科的大使馆。
    苏联政府在这份照会中说，这个会议的目的将是就各国永远停止试验原子武器和氢武器缔结协定，并就执行这项协定建立可靠监督。
    照会中强调指出，立刻全面永远停止核武器试验是有关全人类切身利益的刻不容缓的问题，因此苏联政府希望，参加会议者能尽一切努力，在最短期间内达成并签订相应的协议。
    美国政府在1958年9月10日给苏联政府的照会中指出，美国政府已任命美国裁军问题代表华兹沃斯大使为美国参加10月31日开幕的日内瓦会议代表团主席。
