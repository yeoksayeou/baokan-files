    To guarantee the completion of the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year and the higher-speed development of industry and agriculture next year, the central task of the machinery industry at present is to guarantee the completion of the metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, and machine tools needed for the expanded reproduction of the machinery industry itself, as stipulated by the state. And among these three key areas, the priority is to ensure the metallurgical equipment needed for the production of 10.7 million tons of steel.
    Metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, and the heavy machine tools that manufacture these, are all large and heavy machines. For example, the 650 mm rolling mill, which is a medium-sized rolling mill, already weighs 1,200 tons, and the main parts of the host machine are over ten tons. A 15,000 kW water turbine can only be considered a small hydroelectric power generation equipment, but its main components are also around ten tons. From the perspective of demand, these medium and small metallurgical and power generation equipments are the largest in quantity and number in the hundreds. This raises a problem: in order to guarantee the success of the steel production and the priority of power supply, the central problem that the machinery industry urgently needs to solve is to vigorously develop the manufacturing of heavy machinery.
    To break through the weak link of heavy machinery manufacturing in the shortest possible time, it is first necessary to implement the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises. Some people believe that small and medium-sized enterprises do not have the conditions to manufacture heavy machinery, so isn't it forcing their hands to ask them to manufacture heavy machinery? That is to say, the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises is not applicable to heavy machinery production. We believe that this view is incorrect. The policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises is not only very necessary for heavy machinery manufacturing, but also fully applicable. The current problem to be solved is precisely how to enable small and medium-sized factories that did not originally have the conditions to take a series of effective measures to manufacture heavy machinery.
    The main difficulties encountered in heavy machinery manufacturing are two: one is the lack of large processing equipment, and the other is the lack of large casting and forging production capacity. How to concentrate efforts to break through these two basic links is the key to accelerating the development of heavy machinery manufacturing.
    The advanced experience of "ants gnawing at bones" created by the masses enables small machines to do big jobs, which fundamentally solves the difficulty of many factories lacking large processing equipment, and at the same time can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. At present, "ants gnawing at bones" has become a household name and is deeply rooted in people's hearts. Hundreds of creations are constantly emerging, and factories that have never manufactured heavy machinery are now vigorously manufacturing medium and large-sized smelting equipment, rolling equipment, power generation equipment, and mining machinery. However, the problem of insufficient production capacity of large castings and forgings is still the main contradiction in the current development of heavy machinery manufacturing. In other words, after solving the problem of "ants" being able to gnaw at bones, the manufacturing and supply of "bones" becomes more prominent. As some factory workers reflect: "We can also gnaw at bones, but there are no bones to gnaw."
    The production of large castings and forgings requires heavy hydraulic presses, large steelmaking and casting equipment, and corresponding complete sets of auxiliary equipment and lifting and transportation equipment. These are precisely a weak link in my country's machinery industry, and only a few heavy machinery manufacturing plants have these conditions. During the first five-year plan, the large blanks required by factories across the country were centrally manufactured and supplied in a unified manner by a few heavy machinery plants. The original local state-owned enterprises basically did not develop the production capacity of large castings and forgings. Therefore, the tasks in 1958 and 1959 are particularly tight.
    To solve this contradiction, on the one hand, we must speed up the construction of a new batch of heavy machinery manufacturing plants or casting and forging centers, and on the other hand, we must tap the potential capacity of existing large casting and forging plants. In fact, in the overall national plan, the central and local governments have already arranged the construction of a batch of heavy machinery manufacturing plants and casting and forging centers, and are carrying out construction at a Great Leap Forward speed. However, the growth of casting and forging capacity, from design and construction to equipment installation and commissioning, cannot be accomplished overnight. Generally speaking, only a few of these newly built or renovated projects can be completed, put into production, and play a role in 1958 and 1959. As for the existing few heavy machinery manufacturing plants, although they are also constantly leaping forward and constantly tapping potential capacity, it is not possible to complete the task of large castings and forgings that has increased several times in a very short period of time. Therefore, to break through the weak link of insufficient capacity of large castings and forgings in a very short period of time, we cannot only rely on the existing few heavy machinery manufacturing plants, nor can we wait for the newly built projects during the second five-year plan period, because doing so cannot meet the needs of quantity, nor can it meet the requirements of seizing the time.
    There are two different ways to solve this problem. One is the same as during the first five-year plan, still concentrating the needs of the whole country on the existing few heavy machinery plants for unified solutions. This method is obviously not feasible. The other method is to widely mobilize the masses, offer suggestions, and wherever heavy machinery is manufactured, solve the manufacturing of large blanks themselves. What we need to greatly promote is the latter method. Many factories have now chosen the latter method.
    The experience created by the masses proves that it is not absolutely necessary to use integral large castings and forgings in the design of many types of machines, and it is often based on the traditional structure and the past material selection habits. The masses break the old traditions and abandon the old habits in production, divide the large castings and forgings in many heavy machines into small castings and forgings, and then use mechanical combination or welding connection and other composite process methods to manufacture them. Some people compare this approach to "sewing new clothes with scraps." For example, when the Tangshan Machinery Factory manufactured a 650 mm rolling mill, the frame originally required an integral steel casting, weighing more than 16 tons, which exceeded the capacity of the steelmaking furnace and could not be manufactured. They divided the frame into two castings, each weighing more than eight tons, and then welded them into a whole, which solved the problem. The rotors and seat rings of the 15,000 kW water turbines manufactured by the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory were originally integral steel castings weighing more than ten tons, and in the past they all relied on the cooperation of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory to solve the problem. Now they use the method of block welding, with the largest piece being no more than five tons, which the factory can solve by itself. This advanced method of turning large pieces into small pieces and combining small pieces into large pieces can turn the impossible into the possible for factories without large casting and forging production capacity, transform the absence of conditions into the presence of conditions, and enable general machinery manufacturing factories to solve the manufacturing of large castings and forgings by themselves.
    Secondly, the experience of many factories proves that, in terms of load conditions, the large pieces on certain machines do not necessarily require forged steel parts or cast steel parts; it is entirely possible to replace forged steel with cast steel, replace cast steel with cast iron, replace steel with cement, and replace metal with non-metal. The masses have already created many valuable experiences in this regard. For example, the high-pressure reaction cylinder of fertilizer equipment has always used integral forged steel parts in foreign countries, which requires a heavy hydraulic press of several thousand tons to be competent. Another method is to use a multi-layer steel plate welded structure, but this method is very labor-intensive. Shanghai broke superstition and boldly tried to make high-pressure reaction cylinders with cast steel, and the blasting test proved that the quality was no different from that of forged steel. Another example is that the use of ductile iron has been gradually expanding in recent years. Angang Steel used it to manufacture the rolls of a 1,150 mm primary rolling mill to replace forged steel rolls, which no one had seriously tested in the past. The crankshafts on diesel engines, the frames of certain mining machinery, rotating shafts, rotating gears, etc., which were previously considered to be important machine parts that must be made of forged steel, have also been successfully used with ductile iron. For some models of diesel engines in the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory, 72.4% of the steel parts have been replaced by ductile iron. In addition, the use of reinforced concrete to replace steel to manufacture heavy machine tools has been widely promoted and applied in Chongqing, Xi'an, Shanghai and other places, and more heavy machines are being redesigned with cement structures.
    The above experiences point out an important technical direction in the current development of heavy machinery manufacturing, after the popularization of the "ants gnawing at bones" method. This direction can be summarized as "turn big into small, combine small into big; replace steel with iron, replace forging with casting; use cement for large parts." This direction is the creation of the masses in breaking superstition and boldly innovating. We believe that following this direction can greatly reduce the demand for integral large castings and forgings, so that general factories without large casting and forging equipment can solve the supply of large blanks by themselves, which can greatly alleviate the current situation of large blanks being concentrated in a few heavy machinery manufacturing plants, resulting in a tight supply that cannot meet the demand. This approach, coupled with the use of the "ants gnawing at bones" method to solve large-part processing, can truly achieve the large-scale manufacturing of heavy machinery by large, medium, and small factories in the shortest possible time.
    It should be emphasized that to implement the policy of "turn big into small, combine small into big; replace steel with iron, replace forging with casting; use cement for large parts," it is first necessary to solve two ideological obstacles. First, we must break the idea of some comrades who simply rely on heavy machinery manufacturing plants to centrally supply blanks. Second, we must break the conservative ideas of some technical personnel, especially product designers, who believe that combined structures are always inferior to integral structures, castings are always inferior to forgings, and iron is always inferior to steel. It is unrealistic to rely on a few heavy machinery manufacturing plants to undertake the production of large castings and forgings for the whole country. As for those conservatives and superstitious people, they need to open their eyes and see more facts, and let the facts correct their minds.
    For the time being, "turn big into small, combine small into big; replace steel with iron, replace forging with casting; use cement for large parts" is a method of combining indigenous and foreign methods and making use of local conditions, with the purpose of reducing the pressure that large casting and forging production capacity cannot meet for a while. But its significance is more than that. It opens up a path for large, medium, and small factories, machinery manufacturing and non-machinery manufacturing departments to manufacture heavy machinery independently, quickly, well, and economically. From the perspective of development, it is entirely possible to become a new technical direction in the design and manufacturing of heavy machinery in our country. It is the creation of the masses in the high-speed development of my country's machinery industry, and at the same time, it creates favorable conditions for the future development of heavy machinery manufacturing at an even higher speed.

    给“蚂蚁”供应充足的“骨头”
    为了保证完成今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的任务和明年工农业的更高速度的发展，当前机械工业的中心任务是保证完成国家所规定的冶金设备、发电设备和机械工业本身扩大再生产所需要的机床。而在这三个重点中，又要首先保证为生产一千零七十万吨钢所需要的冶金设备。
    冶金、发电设备以及制造这些设备的重型机床，都是尺寸很大、重量很大的重型机器。例如六百五十公厘轧钢机，在轧钢机中是属于中型的一种，但是它的全重已达一千二百吨，主机的主要零件都在十吨以上。一万五千瓩的水轮机只能算是一种小型的水力发电设备，但是它的主要部件也都在十吨上下。而从需要上看，这些中、小型的冶金和发电设备正是数量最大、数以百计的。这里就出现了一个问题，为了保证钢帅升帐和电力先行，机械工业急需解决的中心问题就是要大力发展重型机器制造。
    要在最短的时间内突破重型机器制造这一薄弱环节，首先要贯彻大中小相结合的方针。有人认为，中小企业不具备制造重型机器的条件，要他们也制造重型机器岂不是强人之难？也就是说，大中小相结合的方针，对重型机器生产是不适用的。我们认为，这种看法是不对的。大中小相结合的方针对于重型机器制造不仅十分必要，而且完全适用。当前要解决的问题正是如何使原来不具备条件的中小工厂采取一系列有效的措施，制造重型机器。
    重型机器制造中遇到的主要困难有两个：一是大型加工设备不足，二是大型铸锻生产能力不足。如何集中力量突破这两个基本环节，是加速发展重型机器制造的关键。
    群众创造的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的先进经验，使小机器也可以干大活，从方法上一举而解决了许多工厂大型加工设备不足的困难，同时又能做到又多又快又好又省。目前，“蚂蚁啃骨头”已经家喻户晓，深入人心，数以百计的创造正不断地涌现出来，从来没有制造过重型机器的工厂现在也在大力制造中型和大型的冶炼设备、轧钢设备、发电设备和矿山机械。但是，大型铸锻件生产能力不足的问题，仍然是当前发展重型机器制造的主要矛盾。换句话说，解决了“蚂蚁”能啃骨头以后，“骨头”的制造和供应问题就显得更为突出了。正如有些工厂的职工们反映：“我们也能啃骨头，就是没有骨头啃。”
    大型铸锻件的生产，需要重型水压机、大型炼钢和铸造设备，以及与之相适应的成套的辅助设备和起重运输设备。而这些正是目前我国机械工业的一个薄弱环节，只有少数重型机器制造厂具备这样的条件。在第一个五年计划期间，全国各厂所需要的大型毛胚都是由少数重型机器厂集中制造、统筹供应的。原来的地方国营企业，基本上没有发展大型铸锻件的生产能力。因此1958年和1959年的任务就显得特别的紧张。
    解决这个矛盾，一方面要加紧建设一批新的重型机器制造厂或铸锻中心厂，另一方面要挖掘现有大型铸锻生产厂的潜在能力。事实上在全国的总体规划中中央和地方都已经安排了一批重型机器制造厂和铸锻中心厂的建设，而且正以大跃进的速度进行建设。但是铸锻能力的增长，从设计、施工到设备安装、投入生产究竟不是一蹴而成的。一般说来，这些新建改建项目能够在1958年和1959年建成并投入生产、发挥作用的为数不多。至于现有的少数重型机器制造厂虽然也在不断地跃进，不断地挖掘潜在能力，但是要求完成成倍增长的大型铸锻件任务，也不是很短时间内能办到的。因此，要在很短时间内突破大型铸锻件能力不足这一薄弱环节，不能仅仅依靠现有的少数重型机器制造厂，也不能等待第二个五年计划期内新建的项目，因为这样做既不能满足数量的需要，也不能达到抢时间的要求。
    解决这个问题有两种不同的办法。一种是和第一个五年计划期间一样，仍把全国的需要集中到现有的几个重型机器厂统一解决，这个办法显然行不通。另一种办法是广泛发动群众，献计献策，那里制造重型机器，那里自己解决大件毛胚的制造。我们需要大大提倡的正是后一种办法。现在已经有许多工厂选择了后一种办法。
    群众创造的经验证明：许多类型的机器在设计中采用整体的大型铸锻件并非绝对必须，往往是出之于沿用传统结构和套用过去的选料习惯。群众在生产中打破旧传统，废弃老习惯，把许多重型机器中的大型铸锻件分成小型铸锻件，然后采用机械并合或焊接联结等复合工艺的方法来制造。有人把这种做法比作“零料缝新衣”。例如唐山机械厂制造六百五十公厘轧钢机，机架原来要求整体铸钢件，全重十六吨多，超出了炼钢炉的能力，没法制造。他们就把机架分成两块铸造，每块重八吨多，然后焊成整体，就解决了问题。哈尔滨电机厂制造一万五千瓩水轮机的转子和座环原来都是十几吨重的整体铸钢件，过去都依靠沈阳重型机器厂协作解决。现在他们采用分块焊接的方法，最大件不过五吨，本厂可以自己解决。这种化大件为小件、并小件成大件的先进方法，对没有大型铸锻生产能力的工厂就能够化不可能为可能，变没有条件为有了条件，使一般机器制造厂都能自己解决大铸锻件的制造。
    其次，许多工厂的经验证明，某些机器上的大件就其负荷条件来说，并不一定需要锻钢件或铸钢件；以铸钢代替锻钢，以铸铁代替铸钢，以水泥代替钢铁，以非金属代替金属是完全可能的。这方面群众已经创造了许多宝贵的经验。例如化肥设备的高压反应筒，国外一直使用整体锻钢件，这需要几千吨的重型水压机才能胜任。另一种方法是用多层钢板焊接结构，但这种办法很费工。上海市破除迷信，大胆尝试，用铸钢制成高压反应筒，经过爆破试验证明和锻钢的质量并无差别。又如球墨铸铁的用途这几年正在逐渐扩大，鞍钢用来制造一千一百五十公厘初轧机的轧辊代替锻钢轧辊，这也是过去没有人认真进行过试验的。柴油机上的曲轴、某些矿山机械的机架、转动轴、转动齿轮等，过去认为必须用锻钢的重要机器零件，也都成功地使用了球墨铸铁。无锡柴油机厂某些型号的柴油机，72.4％的钢件已经用球墨铸铁代替。此外，用钢筋混凝土代替钢铁制造重型机床，在重庆、西安、上海等地都大量推广应用，更多的重型机器改用水泥结构，现在也正在设计。
    以上的经验指出了当前发展重型机器制造中，在“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法推广以后，一个重要的技术方向。这个方向概括地说，就是“大化小，小拼大；铁代钢，铸代锻；水泥作大件。”这个方向是群众破除迷信、大胆革新的创造。我们认为，遵循这个方向就能够大量减少整体大型铸锻件的需要量，使一般没有大型铸锻设备的工厂都能自己解决大件毛胚的供应，这样就可以大大地缓和目前大型毛胚集中在少数重型机器制造厂，因而供不应求的紧张局面。这样作法，再加上用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法解决大件加工，就能在最短时间内真正做到大中小厂大造重型机器。
    应该着重指出：要贯彻“大化小，小拼大；铁代钢，铸代锻；水泥作大件”的方针，首先需要解决两个思想上的障碍。第一、要打破某些同志单纯依靠重型机器制造厂集中供应毛胚的思想。第二、要打破某些技术人员，特别是产品设计人员，那种认为并合结构总不如整体结构，铸件总不如锻件，铁总不如钢的保守思想。依赖少数重型机器制造厂包揽全国大型铸锻件的生产是不现实的。至于那些保守派、迷信派则需要让他们睁开眼睛多看看事实，让事实来纠正他们的脑筋。
    就目前来说，“大化小，小拼大；铁代钢，铸代锻；水泥作大件”是一种土洋结合、因陋就简的作法，目的在于减轻大型铸锻生产能力一时不能满足需要的压力。但是它的意义不止于此。它为大中小工厂、机械制造和非机械制造部门的工厂自力更生制造重型机器开辟了一条多快好省的道路。从发展来看，完全有可能成为我国重型机器设计和制造的一个新的技术方向。它是我国机械工业高速度发展中的群众创造，同时，它又为今后以更高速度发展重型机器制造创造了有利的条件。
