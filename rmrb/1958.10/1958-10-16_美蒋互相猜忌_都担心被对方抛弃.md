Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 15th: A Hamburg dispatch reports that "Der Spiegel" magazine, in an article published today discussing the recent suspicions and disputes between the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States, writes: "American diplomats fear that the 'Formosa (referring to Taiwan) Group's' disappointment with Dulles' September 30th statement could lead to hatred of the United States." "Washington was already able to see these anti-American signs last week." The magazine also states that Washington is very concerned that if Taiwan and the Chinese on the mainland "reach an agreement," it "could very likely cause the United States to lose its base in Formosa (referring to Taiwan)." The article quotes "one of the most influential diplomats" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique as saying: "We will never trust the United States again; we Chinese should now find our own solutions to our own problems." The article writes: "The more the Kuomintang's dream of a triumphant return home is shattered, the more they tend to negotiate and reach an agreement with Red China." The article believes that Dulles' September 30th statement "shattered" the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "illusion" of "being able to land." The article also quotes the "New York Times" as saying: "President Chiang's (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) subordinates are no longer interested in prolonged exile and are not very willing to continue fighting with Red China."

    美蒋互相猜忌
    都担心被对方抛弃
    新华社柏林15日电　汉堡消息，今天出版的一期“明镜”周刊登载的一篇文章在谈到蒋介石集团同美国之间最近发生的猜忌和争吵时写道：“美国外交家担心，福摩萨（指台湾）集团”对杜勒斯9月30日的谈话“所感到的失望会导致憎恨美国”、“华盛顿在上周已经能够看到这种反美迹象”。这家周刊还说，华盛顿很担心台湾同大陆上的中国人如果“协商一致”，就“很可能使美国丧失福摩萨（指台湾）的基地。”文章引用蒋介石集团“最有影响的外交官之一”的话说：“我们将永远不再相信美国，我们中国人现在应该对自己的问题找到自己的解决办法”。文章写道：“国民党人凯旋归国的美梦愈是遭到破灭，他们愈是倾向于同红色中国协商取得一致”。文章认为，杜勒斯9月30日的谈话“打破了”蒋介石集团“能够登陆”的“幻想”。文章还引用“纽约时报”的话写道：“蒋总统（指蒋介石）的部下对长久亡命已不感兴趣，不大想同红色中国继续战斗下去”。
