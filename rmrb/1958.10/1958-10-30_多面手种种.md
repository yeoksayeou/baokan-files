	Various Types of All-Rounders

	“All-Rounders” In March of this year, advanced producers Shen Xikai and Yu Changbo of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant expansion construction site proposed to the workers of Taiyuan City: "Everyone should be an all-rounder, and machines should do multiple jobs." Workers in industrial and mining enterprises and construction enterprises in Shanxi Province also launched an "all-rounder" learning movement throughout the province. Subsequently, workers in many places across the country also successively launched activities to "specialize in one thing while seeking to learn more, learning multiple technologies." The Zhang Baifa Steel Bar Youth Shock Brigade of the Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, in addition to mastering steel bar worker techniques, has learned more than ten technologies in the past two years, including electric welding, gas welding, furnace baking, concrete, machinist, ash and soil worker, scaffolder, sheet metal, and plumbing, with an average of five or six skills per person. Zhao Shikai, a car driver in the Sixth Motor Vehicle Team of the Tianjin Transportation Company, has learned the techniques of repairing carburetors, electrical components, brakes, engines, fitter work, carpentry, maintenance work, tire repair, and tin welding in automobiles, totaling eleven types of work.

	“All-Capable People” In April of this year, Xuguang First Cooperative (now Xuguang People's Commune) in Echeng County, Hubei Province, launched an "all-capable people" movement, requiring each commune member to learn multiple production techniques. The ten standards for "all-capable people" are that male commune members must know the complete set of agricultural production techniques, carpentry, blacksmithing, stonemasonry, bricklaying, operating power machinery, repairing, designing, raising livestock, and navigation, while female commune members must know the complete set of agricultural production techniques, be thrifty in managing the household, operating power machinery, using cattle, repairing, designing, raising livestock, needlework, accounting, and acting. Those who have learned at least five items can be awarded the glorious title of all-capable person. Commune members Yu Xufa and Xiao Gongpu have learned the use, maintenance, and repair techniques of water pumps, and have also learned blacksmithing, forging, fitting, welding, carpentry, bricklaying, drawing design, and sailing, among other techniques. Xiao Gongpu can also generate electricity from biogas. Tian Guiying, a nineteen-year-old "cotton" girl, in addition to understanding the entire set of cotton planting techniques, can also repair radios, patch rubber tire inner tubes, and repair sprayers. The "all-capable people" movement has been vigorously carried out in the vast rural areas of Hubei.

	“Clever Girls” "Clever Girls" is what people call Song Chou'er, a Communist Party member, and Wang Leping and Li Chunhua, members of the Communist Youth League, from Maole Cooperative, Mishan Township, Gaoping County, Shanxi Province. They can not only cut paper flowers, embroider, make cotton wadding, and sew, but also have learned to plow the land with a double-shared plow, manage a pot-camel machine, drill wells with a drilling machine, graft trees, raise bees, feed pigs, and raise chickens; they can also transplant seedlings, weed, irrigate corn, artificially pollinate, and harvest corn, among other farm work. These three red and expert, all-rounder "Clever Girls" have become the banner and example for women throughout the county.

    多面手种种
    “多面手”今年3月，太原钢铁厂扩建工地先进生产者沈锡凯、于长波等向太原市工人提出建议：“人人要作多面手，机器要作多种活。”山西省工矿企业和建筑企业的职工们也在全省开展了一个学习“多面手”运动。随后，全国许多地方的职工也先后开展了“精一求多，学习多种技术”的活动，北京市第三建筑工程公司张百发钢筋工青年突击队，除掌握钢筋工技术外，两年来已经学会了电焊、汽焊、烘炉、混凝土、机工、灰土工、架子工、白铁、水暖等工种的十多种技术，平均每人会五、六种。天津市运输公司第六汽车队汽车司机赵世凯学会修理汽车中的化油器、电气、制动器、引擎、钳工、木工、保养工、轮胎修补、锡焊等十一个工种的技术。
      “万能人”　今年4月，湖北鄂城县旭光一社（现在是旭光人民公社）开展了“万能人”运动，要每个社员学会多种生产技术。“万能人”的十项标准是男社员要会农业生产全套技术、木匠、铁匠、石匠、泥瓦匠、开动力机、修理、设计、饲养、航行，女社员要会农业生产全套技术、勤俭持家、开动力机、用牛、修理、设计、饲养、针线活、会计、演员。其中只要学会了五项就可获得万能人的光荣称号。社员余绪发、肖功普已学会抽水机的使用、保养和修理技术，又学会了打铁、锻工、钳工、焊工、木工、泥瓦工、绘图设计、驾驶帆船等技术。肖功普还会沼气发电。十九岁的“棉花”姑娘田桂英，除懂得整套植棉技术外，还会修理收音机、补胶轮内胎，修理喷雾器。“万能人”运动，已在湖北广大农村蓬勃开展。
      “巧姑娘”　“巧姑娘”是人们对山西省高平县米山乡茂乐社的共产党员宋丑儿、共青团员王乐平和李春花的称呼。她们不仅会剪花、刺绣、弹花、缝纫；更学会了用双铧犁犁地，管理锅驼机，用钻机打井，接树、养蜂、喂猪、养鸡；还会拔苗、锄苗、玉米灌心、人工授粉、割玉茭等农活。这三个又红又专、多面手的“巧姑娘”，已经成为全县妇女的旗帜和榜样。
