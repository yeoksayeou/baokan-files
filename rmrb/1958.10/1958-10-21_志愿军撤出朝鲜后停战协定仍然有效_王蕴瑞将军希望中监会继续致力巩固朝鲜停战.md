Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th – Major General Ren Rong, member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, held a banquet tonight to entertain the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea.

Polish member Major General Szamett, Swedish member Brigadier General Edberg, Czechoslovakian member Major General Šíle, and Swiss alternate member Colonel Wieland attended the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were Major General Jiang Shanghao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, and General Wang Yunrui, Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Major General Ren Rong said at the beginning of the banquet that we highly cherish the friendship that you, our friends, have come from afar to Korea to work with the Korean people and us for peace in Korea, and we believe that the friendship between us will continue to be consolidated and developed. Major General Ren Rong said, "I believe that all friends of the NNSC will continue to fulfill the lofty responsibilities entrusted to them by the Armistice Agreement in the future and continue to contribute to peace in Korea."

General Wang Yunrui said at the banquet, "I am very happy to be able to meet with friends from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission today. Please allow me to take this opportunity to express my best wishes to all friends of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission."

General Wang Yunrui said that over the past five years since the armistice, the NNSC has made significant efforts and played a positive role in monitoring and stabilizing the Korean armistice and maintaining peace in Korea. The work of the NNSC is meaningful. Although the NNSC has encountered various difficulties in the process of carrying out its mission, the very existence of the NNSC has played a role in stabilizing the situation in Korea. We fully support the beneficial work of the NNSC to consolidate the Korean armistice, and we will continue to provide all possible assistance as in the past in your continued execution of the tasks stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

General Wang Yunrui emphasized that the third batch of troop withdrawals carried out by the Chinese People's Volunteers in accordance with the decision announced in the statement of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers on February 20, 1958, is about to end. The Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers will also soon withdraw from Korea. This fully demonstrates that the Chinese people love peace. However, the United States military is still insisting on staying in South Korea and is carrying out war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area. Therefore, after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the Armistice Agreement remains in effect, and the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Military Armistice Commission will continue to remain with the representatives of the Korean People's Army to supervise the implementation of the Armistice Agreement and work for peace in Korea.

The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Czechoslovakian member Major General Šíle thanked the hosts for their hospitality and cordial remarks on the work of the NNSC on behalf of the four member nations of the NNSC. He proposed a toast to the health of the hosts, to the peaceful reunification of Korea, and to the happiness of the Chinese people!

Before the end of the banquet, the Chinese color documentaries "Department Store" and "Zhanjiang New Port" were also shown.

    志愿军撤出朝鲜后停战协定仍然有效
    王蕴瑞将军希望中监会继续致力巩固朝鲜停战
    新华社开城20日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面委员任荣少将今晚举行便宴，招待朝鲜中立国监察委员会的委员。
    波兰委员沙麦特少将，瑞典委员艾德柏准将，捷克斯洛伐克委员席列少将，瑞士候补委员维兰德上校等应邀出席了宴会。
    出席宴会的还有军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员姜尚昊少将和中国人民志愿军参谋长王蕴瑞将军。
    任荣少将在宴会开始时讲话说，各位朋友千里迢迢来到朝鲜同朝鲜人民和我们一起为朝鲜的和平而工作，我们十分珍视这一友谊，并相信我们之间的友谊将会不断的巩固和发展。任荣少将说，我相信中监会各位朋友今后将继续履行停战协定所赋予的崇高职责，为朝鲜的和平而继续作出贡献。
    王蕴瑞将军在宴会上讲话说，今天我能够同中立国监察委员会的朋友们见面，感到十分愉快，请允许我借此机会向中立国监察委员会各位朋友表示最好的祝愿。
    王蕴瑞将军说，停战五年来，中监会对监察和稳定朝鲜停战以及维护朝鲜和平，作了重大的努力，并起了积极的作用。中监会的工作是有意义的。中监会在执行自己任务的过程中，虽曾遭到过种种困难，但是中监会存在这一事实本身，就起着稳定朝鲜局势的作用。我们完全支持中监会为巩固朝鲜停战而进行的有益的工作，在你们继续执行停战协定所规定的任务的过程中，我们将像过去一样继续提供一切可能的协助。
    王蕴瑞将军强调指出，现在，中国人民志愿军根据中国人民志愿军总部1958年2月20日声明中所宣布的决定而进行的第三批撤军工作，即将结束。中国人民志愿军总部也即将撤离朝鲜。这充分表示了中国人民是热爱和平的。但是，目前美国军队仍然坚持留在南朝鲜，而且正在台湾海峡地区向中国人民进行战争挑衅。因此，在中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜以后，停战协定仍然继续有效，军事停战委员会的中国人民志愿军代表将继续留下同朝鲜人民军代表一道为监督停战协定的实施，为朝鲜和平而努力。
    宴会洋溢着热情友好的气氛。捷克斯洛伐克委员席列少将代表中监会四国委员感谢主人的盛情招待和对中监会工作的亲切谈话。他提议为主人的健康，为朝鲜的和平统一和中国人民的幸福干杯！
    在宴会结束前，还放映了中国彩色纪录影片“百货大楼”和“湛江新港”。
