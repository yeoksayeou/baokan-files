    Developing Water Transport
    Our country is a country of abundant water. The great development of water conservancy and river network construction has created extremely favorable conditions for the development of water transport in our country. Ancient poets praised the Jiangnan region as the "richest area," which is inseparable from the fact that the Jiangnan area has a crisscrossing water network, farmland can be irrigated, and water transportation is relatively developed. Last winter and this spring, the Huaibei area of Anhui Province carried out large-scale river network construction, providing a water management experience for the northern plains of our country. Adopting their experience can not only eradicate water and drought disasters in the vast plains of the north and promote the leap forward development of industrial and agricultural production, but also directly create the best conditions for the development of water transport. The ideal of transforming the northern plains into Jiangnan will soon be realized, and the phenomenon of "southerners traveling by boat and northerners riding horses" for thousands of years will be changed. All types of ships will sail on the vast plains of northern China.
    Water transport occupies an important position in transportation. In the Huai River and Yangtze River basin areas, water transport accounts for about 70% of the total freight volume in these areas. Moreover, water transport has the advantages of large volume and low cost. For example, a train car can generally only load 50 or 60 tons, a car can only load a few tons, a handcart can only load a few hundred kilograms, and an airplane can only load a few tons, while ships under 100 tons are considered small boats, and large ships can carry tens of thousands of tons. In terms of cost, according to comparisons between Hubei, Guangdong, and other places with automobiles, automobiles cost about 0.2 yuan per ton-kilometer, while ship transportation only costs about 0.02 yuan, only one-tenth of the cost of automobiles. Therefore, in the context of the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in our country and the extremely tight transportation situation, seizing the great opportunity of the unprecedented large-scale river network construction movement that is about to be launched in various places and vigorously developing water transport will be a shortcut to solving the need for transportation to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural production, and further promote industrial and agricultural production. It is also in line with the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    While grasping the navigation of large river networks, the navigation work of small river networks must not be ignored. Because small river networks are usually the main aspect used by people's communes to carry out field transportation such as transporting grain and delivering fertilizer. These small river networks can be dug quickly, and wooden boats can pass after they are dug. The transportation capacity of a small boat is several times or even dozens of times more than that of ox carts and handcarts, and the speed is much faster than that of ox carts and handcarts. With the further leap forward development of agricultural production, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land and the output of grain will increase several times or dozens of times. It will take a lot of labor to simply deliver these fertilizers to the fields and transport the grain back home. If most of the transportation is done by water, a large amount of labor can be saved to engage in intensive cultivation and expand industrial and sideline production.
    This winter and next spring, the planned earthwork tasks for digging river networks in various provinces in the northern plains of our country are all above 10 billion cubic meters, which will open up hundreds of thousands of kilometers of waterways for the transportation sector. If the transportation department closely cooperates with water conservancy, agriculture, and other relevant departments, plans early, and achieves roughly consistent standards for the specifications of waterways, ship locks, and bridges between provinces and within provinces, and makes a series of preparations such as ship manufacturing and technical personnel training in advance, then a brand new situation will emerge in water transport in our country next year.

### 发展水上运输

    发展水上运输
    我国是个多水的国家。大闹水利化、河网化，这就为发展我国的水上运输创造了极有利的条件。古代诗人歌颂江南是“首富之区”，这是和江南地区水网纵横，农田能得到灌溉、水上交通比较发达分不开的。去冬今春，安徽省淮北地区大修河网化工程，为我国北方平原地区提供了一条治水经验，采取他们的经验，不仅可以根除北方广大平原上的水旱灾害，促进工农业生产的飞跃发展，而且也直接为发展水上运输创造了最好的条件。一个变北方平原为江南的理想，不会很久就可以实现了，千百年来“南人乘船、北人骑马”的现象将要改变了，各种类型的船只将要在祖国北方的辽阔平原上航行了。
    水上运输在交通运输中占着重要的地位。在淮河以及长江流域地区，水上运输的货运量都占到这些地区的货运总量的70％左右。而且水上运输具有量大、成本低的优越性。如火车车皮一般只能装载五、六十吨，汽车只能装几吨，手推车只能装几百公斤，飞机也只能装几吨，而船只在一百吨以下的算小船，大船可载运几万吨。论成本，据湖北、广东等地与汽车比较，汽车每一吨公里要两角钱左右，而船运只要两分钱上下，只及汽车成本的十分之一。因此，在我国工农业生产一日千里地飞跃发展、交通运输异常紧张的形势下，抓住各地即将开展空前规模的河网化运动的大好时机，大力发展水上运输，将是解决交通运输不能适应工农业生产发展的需要，并进一步促进工农业生产的一条捷径，也是符合多快好省的总路线精神的。
    在抓大河网的航运的同时，绝不能忽视小河网的航运工作。因为小河网通常是人民公社用来进行运粮、送肥等田间运输的主要方面，这种小河网开挖起来快，挖成后就可通木船，一只小船的运量要比牛车、手推车的运量多几倍甚至几十倍，而且速度还比牛车、手推车快得多。随着农业生产的进一步飞跃发展，每亩土地的施肥量和粮食的产量都要成倍或几十倍地增加，仅仅把这些肥料送下地，把粮食运回家，就要不少劳动力。如果大部分采用水运，就能大量地节省出劳动力来从事精耕细作，扩大工业、副业等生产。
    今冬明春，我国北方平原地区各省计划开挖河网的土方任务，都在一百亿公方以上，这将为交通运输部门开辟几十万公里的航道。交通部门如果与水利、农业等有关部门紧密协作，及早规划，把省内和省际之间的航道、船闸、桥梁等的规格取得大体一致的标准，并预先作好船舶制造、技术人员培养等一系列的准备工作，那么明年我国的水上运输将出现一个崭新的局面。
