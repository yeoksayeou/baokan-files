Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th. Menon, head of the Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, stated in a television program on CBS in the United States on the 12th that India only recognizes one China.

He said that both mainland China and Taiwan are part of China. Unless there is a possibility of unification between mainland China and Taiwan, the crisis in the Taiwan Strait will continue. Menon said that he personally believes that the Chinese have a great ability to resolve their differences, so the best thing to do is to let the Chinese resolve their own affairs.

Menon expressed his disapproval of the United Nations interfering in this issue, which belongs to China's internal affairs. He welcomed the order from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense to extend the ceasefire of shelling of Jinmen for another two weeks.

Menon stated that Americans should not encourage Chiang Kai-shek to believe that the United States will continue to support him in his dispute with the Communists. But he then stated that he did not mean that the United States should abandon its obligations to Taiwan.

    梅农在美国发表演说指出
    台湾问题应由中国人解决
    联合国不应对中国内政进行干涉
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：印度参加联合国大会代表团团长梅农12日在美国哥伦比亚广播公司的电视节目中发表演说说，印度只承认有一个中国。
    他说，中国大陆和台湾都是中国的一部分。除非有了中国大陆和台湾统一的可能，台湾海峡的危机会继续存在下去。梅农说，他个人认为，中国人有解决分歧的巨大的能力，因此最好的事情就是让中国人自己来解决他们的事情。
    梅农表示不赞成联合国来干涉这一属于中国内政的问题。他表示欢迎中国国防部对金门炮击再停两个星期的命令。
      梅农表示，美国人不应当鼓励蒋介石认为美国在他同共产党人纠纷中将继续支持他。但是他接着又表示，他这样谈并不意味着美国应当背弃它对台湾承担的义务。
