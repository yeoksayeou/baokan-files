Problems Urgently Requiring Solutions for Bumper Cotton Harvests
Bud and Boll Dropping, Shaded Cotton Fields, and Labor Shortages
Yang Shufan

There are still two months before the cotton harvest is complete, but "satellites" (high yield records) are already showing promise. It is estimated that this year's total output will increase by more than double compared to last year.

This year, cotton production has not only seen great changes in basic production conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil, but has also broken with conventions in production management. Post-planting cotton field management has been strengthened, changing the old habits of not cultivating, irrigating, or topdressing fertilizer in the later stages.

The changes in cotton production this year have brought about some new problems that need to be solved, such as: 1. The problem of bud and boll abscission. Although this is an old problem, the need to solve it is even more urgent in the context of high yields. 2. The problem of shading in cotton fields. This is due to changes in soil and fertilizer conditions, close planting, and tall cotton plants. The arrangement of row spacing in cotton fields needs further research in the future. 3. The problem of labor shortage. In addition to solving this problem through the organization and arrangement of labor, it is more important to reform tools; such as deep plowing, sowing, cultivating, fertilizing, pest control, and pulling cotton stalks, all of which require improved and newly created labor-saving, effective, and high-efficiency tools.

    棉花丰产亟需解决的问题
    蕾铃脱落棉田荫蔽劳力不足
    杨树藩
    现在离棉花收获完毕还有两个月，但是“卫星”已露苗头。据估计今年总产量将比去年增加一倍以上。
    今年棉花生产不仅是水、肥、土等基本生产条件有了很大改变，在生产管理上也打破了陈规，加强了棉田后期管理，改变了过去一到后期就不中耕、不灌溉、不追肥的老习惯。
    今年棉花生产情况的改变，出现一些新的问题需要解决，例如：一、蕾铃脱落问题。虽然这是一个老问题，但是在高额丰产的情况下，解决这个问题的要求更为迫切了。二、棉田荫蔽问题。这是由于土、肥条件改变、密植和棉花枝株高大而产生的。今后棉田株行距的排列等需做进一步的研究。三、劳动力不足问题。除在劳力的组织安排上解决外，更重要的是工具改革；如深耕、播种、中耕、施肥、治虫以及拔棉柴等，都需要改进和创造省工、效果好、效率高的工具。
