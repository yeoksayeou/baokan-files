Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 28th: Hong Kong sources report: Hong Kong newspapers associated with Taiwan have recently published commentaries on the results of the US-Chiang talks, generally expressing disappointment with the Taiwan authorities' subservient situation and anger and dissatisfaction with the United States.

　　The "Universal Daily News" commentary on the 26th stated that the US-Chiang joint communiqué "shows that the United States now wants to adopt a new policy toward China," which is a "policy of isolating the Communists from the Nationalists." The United States' so-called demands that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group "abandon the use of force to counterattack the mainland" and reduce the garrison on Kinmen, as well as proposing so-called "permanent ceasefire," are all "concrete steps and methods for the United States to implement its 'isolation policy'." The commentary said, "What Dulles left to Taipei on this trip, undeniably, is a heavy heart." Is the Taiwan authorities "preparing to die of old age in Taiwan"? The commentary said that the "consequences are indeed unimaginable" of the Dulles-Chiang talks communiqué, and "how can this not make the old man of Caoshan (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) impatient!"

　　The "Hong Kong Commercial Daily" editorial on the 26th said that the publication of the US-Chiang joint communiqué has at least "three major disadvantages." The first is that "Taiwanese public opinion is deeply dissatisfied with this," believing that the Taiwan authorities' "negotiations with the United States have failed." The second is that some pro-Kuomintang overseas Chinese "are extremely shaken in their hearts, and the trauma to their minds can be compared to eating a political 'atomic bomb'." The third is that "foreigners believe that this communiqué has given Dulles two major victories," that is, Dulles forced Chiang Kai-shek to provide a "guarantee of abandoning the use of force" and forced the Taiwan authorities to accept the concept of "two Chinas."

　　This Kuomintang newspaper asked, "After paying these huge prices, what can the Taiwan authorities get?" "Strictly speaking, we will gain nothing." This newspaper said that the US-Chiang joint communiqué has been published, and in the "perceptions of the Kuomintang people, they will not only resent the inhuman attitude of the United States, but also regret that our government authorities (referring to the Taiwan authorities) have been too accommodating." This joint communiqué makes the Taiwan authorities "sacrifice their sovereignty and basic principles first, then it is truly seeing the harm before seeing the benefit." The Taiwan authorities "are so accommodating to others, it is difficult to explain to the people of the country," so "it is truly painful to say" and "truly regrettable."

　　The "Sing Tao Daily" editorial angrily said that the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué shows that the Taiwan authorities "have sacrificed for the United States, which can be described as the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness. In today's world, there is nothing greater than sacrificing for friendship in friendship." The editorial said that according to the joint communiqué, the Taiwan authorities "have to bear a lot of responsibility, and what they get is relatively small. That is to say, the United States benefits more." The editorial said, "Is the Taiwan authorities willing to commit suicide for the American ally? It should be made clear first, don't commit suicide and still be regarded as 'stupid'."

　　The "Natural Daily" published a Taipei dispatch on the 26th saying that the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué has caused a "strong reaction" among Chiang Kai-shek's troops, causing dissatisfaction. At the same time, this newspaper published a commentary entitled "We Cannot Ask the United States Not to Want the People's Hearts, We Should Abolish the Sino-American (Chiang) Communiqué and Turn Grief and Anger into Action." After pointing out that the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué made "Taiwanese newspapers unanimously express anger," this pro-Chiang newspaper said, "Indeed, this is a tragedy being staged, 'laughter and tears depend on the person', 'wiping saliva from one's face', in the world, there is nothing more worthy of grief and regret than this. Today, with the facts before us, may I ask what is the difference between us and cowards? May I ask if the continuation of this action is not the staging of a political tragedy?" The commentary said that the Taiwan authorities "should not sacrifice and suffer for others." It said that the Taiwan authorities "have been humiliated too much and can hardly bear it anymore." This newspaper advocated "abolishing this communiqué immediately."

　　Another commentary in the "Natural Daily" also said that Dulles' trip was successful, and the loser was Chiang Kai-shek. This newspaper lamented: "Alas, the way of friendship, alas, justice, since Dulles is our 'old friend', then his actions are too sentimental!"

　　The Hong Kong "Shanghai Daily" commentary on the 25th said that the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué makes people "feel depressed" because it is the Taiwan authorities' "obvious submission to the United States, highly demonstrating the spirit of 'enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens'," and "with the publication of this communiqué, people will know that it is due to American pressure, as long as people understand that the government (referring to the Taiwan authorities) has no choice but to do so, then in their hearts, they will have greater antipathy towards the United States."

　　The "Hong Kong Times" commentaries over the past few days have been self-deceptive and feigned joy, trying to cover up the Taiwan authorities' missteps in the Dulles-Chiang talks, attempting to soothe people's hearts, and insisting that the Dulles-Chiang talks have "gained" a lot. However, this Kuomintang mouthpiece had to admit that the results of the Dulles-Chiang talks had "many reactions" among Kuomintang personnel, and "undoubtedly many people will be indignant." This newspaper revealed the emotions of some people in the Taiwan Kuomintang who were worried about being abandoned by the United States on the one hand, and still had illusions about the United States on the other, and also revealed their worries about the cracks that had already appeared between the United States and the Taiwan authorities. It said that in the "current international environment," the US and Chiang "are both struggling hard in the midst of dangers." It did not mention everything Dulles did to "struggle hard" with Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, but desperately called on the US and Chiang to "trust and understand each other."

    香港亲蒋报纸对蒋美会谈结果不胜唏嘘
    愤美国“盟友”之咄咄逼人  悲台湾当局之忍气吞声
    新华社广州28日电　香港消息：与台湾方面有关的香港报纸最近几天对美蒋会谈的结果连续发表评论，普遍流露出对台湾当局俯仰由人的处境感到失望和对美国愤慨不满的情绪。
    “环球报”26日的评论说，美蒋会谈公报“显示美国现欲采取一种对华新政策”，那就是“国共隔离政策”。美国所谓要台湾蒋介石集团“放弃以武力反攻大陆”和削减金门驻军，以及提出所谓“永久停火”等等，都是美国“实行‘隔离政策’的具体步骤与方法”。评论说，“杜勒斯此行留给台北的，无可讳言的是沉重的心情”。台湾当局是否
  “准备老死台湾”呢？评论说，杜蒋会谈公报的“后果确是不堪想像的”，这
  “如何能使草山老人（指蒋介石）不躁急”！
    “工商日报”26日社论说，美蒋会谈公报的发表，至少已有“三大不利”。第一是“台湾舆论对此深表不满”，认为台湾当局的“对美谈判，已告失败”。第二是使一些亲国民党的华侨“人心极为震动，其心灵所受的创伤，可以比于吃了一颗政治‘原子弹’”。第三是“外国人的看法，认为此项公报已使杜勒斯取得两大胜利”，那就是杜勒斯迫使蒋介石提供“放弃使用武力”的“保证”，以及迫使台湾当局接受“两个中国”的观念。
    这家国民党报纸问道，台湾当局“付出这些巨大代价之后，能够得到一些什么呢？”“严格的说，我们将是一无所得。”这家报纸说，杜蒋会谈公报发表了，它在国民党人“观感中，不仅将怨恨美国态度的不近人情，且将抱憾我政府当局（指台湾当局）的过于迁就”。这个会谈公报使台湾当局“自己先自牺牲其主权与基本的原则，那就真正未见其利先蒙其害了”。台湾当局“如此屈就他人，那是很难以向国人交代的”，因此“说来真该引为悲痛”和“真堪惋惜”。
      “星岛日报”的社论愤愤地说，杜蒋会谈公报说明台湾当局“为美国而牺牲，可谓仁至义尽矣。当今之世，有在友道上为友情而牺牲者，这当属最大的一桩”。社论说，依照联合公报，台湾当局“要负很多责任，而所得比较少。那就是说美国占便宜多”。社论说，台湾当局“愿为美国盟友而自杀吗？应先弄清楚，不要自杀了，还被人目为‘愚蠢’”。
      “自然日报”26日发表台北消息说，杜蒋会谈公报已在蒋介石军队方面发生了“强烈反响”，引起了不满。同时，这家报纸以“我们不能要美国不要民心，应废止中（蒋）美公报，把悲愤化为行动”为标题发表评论，在指出杜蒋会谈公报使“台湾报纸一致表示愤怒”以后，这家亲蒋报纸说，“诚然，这是一个悲剧上演，‘啼笑因人’，‘唾脸自干’，世界上，任何值得悲愤与扼惋的事莫若如此。今天事实摆在面前，试问我们与懦夫有何分别？试问这一行动的延续，不是个政治悲剧的上演吗？”评论说，台湾当局“实在不应把自己命运拿来替代别人牺牲受过”。它说，台湾当局“受辱的地方太多了，也难再忍受了”。这家报纸主张
  “应该立即废止这个公报”。
      “自然日报”另外一篇评论还说，杜勒斯此行是成功的，失败者是蒋介石。这家报纸悲叹：“呜呼友道，呜呼正义，杜卿既是我们‘老友’，则他此举太使人感慨了！”
    香港“上海日报”25日的评论说，杜蒋会谈公报使人“闷闷不乐”，因为它是台湾当局“显然的屈从美国，高度表现了‘忍辱负重’的精神”，而“此项公报的发表，人们都会知道是出于美国的压力，只要人们了解政府（指台湾当局）此举是无可奈何，那在他们的内心，一定会对美国怀有更大的反感”。
    “香港时报”连日的评论则自欺欺人地强作欢颜，竭力遮掩台湾当局在杜蒋会谈中的失策，企图抚慰人心，硬说杜蒋会谈大有“收获”。但是，这家国民党机关报不得不承认，杜蒋会谈的结果在国民党人员中“反应颇多”，并且“无疑许多人都会愤懑不平”。这家报纸流露了台湾国民党一些人士一方面担心被美国抛弃，另一方面对美国仍存有幻想的情绪，并且流露出对美国和台湾当局之间已经出现的裂痕忧心忡忡。它说，在“目前的国际环境”中，美蒋“双方都在险阻丛生中艰苦奋斗”。它没有提到杜勒斯跑到台湾向蒋介石“艰苦奋斗”的一切所作所为，却声嘶力竭地呼吁美蒋“双方应该互信互谅”。
