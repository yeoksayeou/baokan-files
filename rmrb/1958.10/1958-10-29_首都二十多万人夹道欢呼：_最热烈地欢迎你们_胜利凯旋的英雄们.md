Xinhua News Agency, 28th—Our great motherland's enthusiastic welcome to the returning outstanding sons and daughters – the Chinese People's Volunteer Army – reached a new climax in the capital today.

This afternoon, when the glorious delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived in Beijing by train, Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Premier of the State Council, and all responsible persons of the central organs in Beijing went to the station to welcome them. Comrade Zhou Enlai tightly grasped the hands of General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, and said excitedly:

	"On behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, on behalf of the government and the people of the whole country, I most enthusiastically welcome you – the heroes of victory!"

When the glorious delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived at its residence in the Beijing Hotel from the station, more than 200,000 people lined the long road to welcome the returning heroes. People waved flowers and red flags, beat gongs and drums, and set off firecrackers. Colored paper scraps and streamers flew all over the sky. More than 200,000 people in the capital unanimously expressed their common inner voice to the heroes: "Welcome, the most beloved people!"

Today, in the capital of the motherland, from the platform of the Beijing Railway Station to the gate of the Beijing Hotel, the streets were full of colorful flags, ribbons, and banners, and many slogan towers were erected along the way. On the historically famous Qianmen Arrow Tower, huge red slogan squares were written with eye-catching golden characters: "Welcome the Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." On the tall building of the Beijing Hotel, two huge slogans stretched straight down from the roof, reaching a length of forty meters, on which were written: "Salute to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" "Long live the victory of the great Resist America, Aid Korea Movement!" Two huge oil paintings stood on both sides of the gate, depicting the everlasting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood and the warm welcome of the people of the motherland to the heroes who have repeatedly made meritorious deeds in the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. These were created overnight by famous artists in the capital.

At exactly 3:00 PM, the train carrying the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Volunteer Army Art Troupe slowly entered Beijing Station. At this time, the military band played the solemn battle song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Comrade Zhou Enlai and thousands of people from all walks of life sang this heroic battle song together with great joy.

After the heroes stepped off the train, they were warmly welcomed by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Mayor of Beijing, Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, and Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Resist America, Aid Korea Branch, as well as Li Yonghao, the Korean Ambassador to China.

It is difficult to describe with the most beautiful language the vivid scene when the central leaders at all levels met with the returning heroes. Some people shook hands with the heroes warmly, some hugged each other enthusiastically, some were talking loudly, and many people could not restrain their excited feelings and shed tears. Premier Zhou Enlai excitedly took the arms of two Volunteer Army heroes and took photos with them. Hundreds of children representing the people of the capital presented flowers to the returning heroes. When the heroes stepped out of the platform decorated with colored silk and slogans amidst joyful music, the masses on the platform jumped and cheered, scattering a large number of colored paper scraps and streamers to the heroes. General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, with tears of gratitude in their eyes, waved flowers to greet the welcoming masses.

After leaving the station, General Yang Yong, accompanied by Peng Zhen and Guo Moruo, and General Wang Ping, accompanied by Li Jishen and Cheng Qian, took convertibles separately, together with the delegation of the Volunteer Army and the Volunteer Army Art Troupe, from the station to the Beijing Hotel. Along this long road, there were crowds of people everywhere, densely packed with welcoming masses. During the thirty minutes the car passed, firecrackers kept booming in the sky above this wide road, smoke and dust filled the air, various musical instruments kept playing, colorful flags were like forests, colorful flowers flew, and songs and slogans continued to resound through the clouds. Wherever the heroes went, there was a climax of joy.

The more than 200,000 welcoming masses included workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and people from all walks of life. They not only represented the more than six million people of the capital to welcome the returning heroes, but also represented the more than 600 million people of the whole country to welcome the returning heroes. Representatives of the three armed forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the army, navy, and air force, and all the militiamen of the Capital Militia Division were particularly excited when they saw their heroic comrades. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army applauded warmly, cheering for the great victory achieved by the close comrades-in-arms, the Volunteer Army, in the Resist America, Aid Korea struggle. They shouted excitedly: "Our heroic comrades have returned!" "Salute to you!" Shang Suokui, a new soldier of the artillery second company of a certain unit who won the title of "Five Good," said that the Volunteer Army has the most experience in fighting the American devils. I must work hard to learn from them, train myself to become a steel warrior, and contribute my strength to opposing American imperialist aggression and defending the security of the motherland. The men and women militiamen of the Capital Militia Division were fully armed today, standing solemnly in formation on the station square to welcome the Volunteer Army. When the convertible carrying General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping passed in front of the Militia Division's formation, the commanders of each battalion and company shouted, "Salute to the Volunteer Army," and the militiamen followed suit with three rhythmic shouts: Salute, Salute, Salute.

General Yang Yong constantly waved bouquets to express his greetings to the capital's militiamen, and from time to time chatted with Peng Zhen and Guo Moruo, praising the majestic and orderly lineup of the capital's militia as a powerful reserve force of the motherland.

Cai Liancheng, the shift leader of the converter workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, had not slept for three days and three nights in the battle for steel. Although his eyes were bloodshot, he still came with full spirit to welcome the most beloved people. All the workers in his class specially held a class meeting this morning, and everyone proposed to increase the daily smelting of thirty furnaces of steel to thirty-five furnaces, that is, to produce fifteen tons more steel to welcome the most beloved people. The Sijiqing People's Commune, which is in the midst of deep plowing and deep turning and a high tide of steelmaking, released a satellite yesterday that produced 10,000 jin of steel per day. Today, Wang Fuhai, the deputy director of this commune, specially rushed from the suburbs to the station to welcome the Volunteer Army. He said that the Volunteer Army defeated American imperialism and defended our victorious fruits, so that the people of the motherland can build socialism well. At this time, Liu Guoqiang, a station chief of the Dongfeng People's Commune, who was standing next to Wang Fuhai, also said excitedly that welcoming the Volunteer Army who are far away from the motherland is a great happy event in our lives!

In the residential team in Dongdan Zhenjiang Hutong, Gu Mama, the mother of nine children, squeezed to the front of the team, waving the flowers in her hand to welcome the relatives returning victoriously from Korea. After receiving a letter from her son in Korea a week ago, she looked forward to this moment day and night. When the car carrying the Volunteer Army representatives slowly drove over, she was moved to tears, and the scene of sending off her youngest child to the Korean front eight years ago flashed in her mind again. She said to the people next to her with a smile, "How much has changed today compared to eight years ago! My son must have grown stronger during the years of resisting America and aiding Korea. If the American devils dare to launch a war in the Taiwan Strait, I will resolutely let my son go to the front again to severely打击(dǎjī - strike/hit) the aggressors."

Tiananmen Square was dressed in festive attire again today. The eight red palace lanterns and eight large red flags flying in the wind reappeared on the Tiananmen Gate Tower. On both sides of Tiananmen, huge slogans in red and gold welcoming the victorious return of the Volunteer Army were prominently displayed in front of people's eyes: "Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood!" When General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping passed through Tiananmen Square in convertibles, thousands of hands crossed over people's heads, constantly waving to welcome the most beloved people.

The solemn welcome of the people of the motherland greatly encouraged the heroes of the Volunteer Army. They expressed that in the future, they will contribute all their strength to the cause of building and defending the motherland. Wang Zhanshan, a second-class combat hero who had made meritorious service in the Battle of Jincheng, said: I must work hard in the future to repay the motherland for its love. He also said: American imperialism is still occupying our country's territory of Taiwan and interfering in our country's internal affairs. We will be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland and fight for the liberation of Taiwan.

    首都二十多万人夹道欢呼：
    最热烈地欢迎你们  胜利凯旋的英雄们
    新华社28日讯　我们伟大祖国对凯旋归来的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军的热烈欢迎，今天在首都达到了新的高潮。
    今天下午，当光荣的中国人民志愿军代表团乘火车到达北京的时候，中共中央副主席、全国人民政协主席、国务院总理周恩来和中央机关在北京的所有负责人都到车站欢迎。周恩来同志紧紧地握着中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将和政治委员王平上将的手，激动地说：
  “我代表党中央和毛主席，代表政府和全国人民，最热烈地欢迎你们——胜利凯旋的英雄们！”
    当光荣的中国人民志愿军代表团由车站乘车到达北京饭店住所时，在漫长的道路两旁有二十多万人夹道欢迎凯旋归来的英雄们。人们挥舞着鲜花和红旗，鸣锣击鼓，燃放鞭炮。彩色纸片和纸条漫天飞舞，二十多万首都人民不约而同地向英雄们道出了自己内心的共同话语：“欢迎你，最可爱的人！”
    今天，在祖国的首都，从北京车站的月台到北京饭店的大门前，沿街挂满了彩旗、彩带和横幅标语，沿途还搭起了许多标语塔。在历史悠久的前门箭楼，一个个巨大的红色标语方牌上，写着醒目的金色大字：“欢迎中国人民志愿军代表团”。在北京饭店的高大建筑物上，两幅巨大标语从楼顶直贯楼下，长达四十公尺，那上面写着：“向英雄的中国人民志愿军致敬！”“伟大的抗美援朝运动胜利万岁！”有两幅巨大的油画竖立在大门两旁，它们描绘了中朝两国人民的以鲜血凝成的友谊万古长青和祖国人民热烈欢迎在抗美援朝运动中屡建功勋的英雄们。这是首都著名画家彻夜创作出来的。
    下午三时整，中国人民志愿军代表团和志愿军文艺工作团乘坐的火车徐徐开进北京车站。这时，军乐队奏起了庄严的中国人民志愿军战歌，周恩来同志和成千的各界人民一起，合着乐曲兴高彩烈地唱起这支英雄的战歌来。
    英雄们步下火车以后，受到了周恩来同志，中共中央政治局委员、人大常委会副委员长、北京市长彭真，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅元帅，人大常委会副委员长、中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若，人大常委会副委员长、民革中央主席李济深，人大常委会副委员长程潜，国防委员会副主席张治中和北京抗美援朝分会主席张奚若，以及朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐等的热烈欢迎。
    用最美好的语言也难于形容出中央各级领导同志同凯旋归来的英雄们会见时的生动情景。有人在紧紧的同英雄们亲切握手，有人互相热烈拥抱，有人在大声地叙谈着，许多人抑制不住兴奋的感情而落下了眼泪。周恩来总理兴奋地挽着两个志愿军英雄战士的手臂，同他们一起合影留念。几百名少年儿童代表首都人民向归国英雄们献了鲜花。当英雄们在欢乐的乐曲中步出用彩绸和标语装饰起来的月台时，月台上的群众跳跃欢呼，把大批彩色纸片和纸条撒给英雄们。杨勇上将和王平上将含着感激的眼泪，挥舞着鲜花向欢迎群众致意。
    走出车站以后，杨勇上将由彭真和郭沫若陪同，王平上将由李济深和程潜陪同分别乘上敞篷汽车，同志愿军代表团和志愿军文艺工作团一起由车站到北京饭店。在这条漫长的道路两旁，人山人海，到处都是密密麻麻的欢迎群众。在汽车所经过的三十分钟的时间内，这条宽阔的马路上空，鞭炮一直在轰响，烟尘蔽空，各种乐器一直在奏鸣，彩旗如林，彩花飞舞，歌声和口号声连绵不断，响彻云端，英雄们走到那里，那里就是欢乐的高潮。
    二十多万欢迎群众中，包括工、农、兵、学、商和各行各业，他们不仅代表六百多万首都人民来欢迎归国的英雄们，而且他们也代表着全国六亿多人民来欢迎归国的英雄们。中国人民解放军陆海空三军部队代表和首都民兵师全体民兵在看到他们英勇的战友时特别兴奋。解放军的官兵们热烈鼓掌，为亲密的战友志愿军在抗美援朝斗争中所取得的伟大胜利而欢呼。他们兴奋地喊着：“我们英雄的战友回来啦！”“向你们致敬！”某部炮兵二连的荣获“五好”的新战士尚锁魁说，志愿军打美国鬼子最有经验，我要努力向他们学习，把自己锻炼成为钢铁战士，为反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫祖国安全贡献出自己的力量。首都民兵师的男女民兵今天全副武装，雄赳赳地整队在车站广场上欢迎志愿军。当杨勇上将、王平上将乘坐的敞篷车走到民兵师的队伍前，这时在民兵师的队伍里，各营连的指挥员都高呼：“向志愿军致敬”，民兵们也随之有节奏地高呼三声：致敬、致敬、致敬。
    杨勇上将不断挥舞着花束向首都民兵们表示致意，并且不时地和彭真、郭沫若交谈，称赞祖国首都的民兵阵容雄壮整齐，是祖国一支强大的后备力量。
    石景山钢铁厂转炉车间的值班长蔡连成在为钢铁的战斗中，已经三天三夜没有睡觉了，他虽然两眼熬得通红，但依然精神饱满地赶来欢迎最可爱的人。他所在的一个班的全体工人特地在今晨开了班务会，大伙提出要把每天炼三十炉钢提高到三十五炉，即多出十五吨钢来迎接最可爱的人。正处在深耕深翻和炼钢高潮中的四季青人民公社，昨天放出了日产万斤钢的卫星。今天，这个社的副主任王福海特从郊外赶到车站来欢迎志愿军。他说，志愿军打败了美帝国主义，保卫了我们胜利的果实；才使祖国人民能好好地建设社会主义。这时，站在王福海身旁的东风人民公社的一个站长刘国强也激动地说，欢迎远离祖国的志愿军，是我们一生中的大喜事啊！
    在东单镇江胡同的居民队伍中，九个孩子的顾妈妈挤在队伍的最前列，舞动着手中的鲜花迎接从朝鲜凯旋归来的亲人。她在一个星期前接到儿子从朝鲜的来信后，就日夜盼望今天这个时刻。当志愿军代表乘坐的汽车徐徐驰过来时，她激动得热泪盈眶，在脑中又闪出八年前送别自己最小的孩子走上朝鲜前线的情景。她满面笑容地对身旁的人说，“今天和八年前有多大的变化啊！我儿子在抗美援朝的年月里一定长得更结实了，如果美国鬼子敢在台湾海峡发动战争，我坚决让儿子再走上前线狠狠地打击侵略者。”
    天安门广场今天又披上了节日的盛装。红色的八盏宫灯，迎风飘扬的八面大红旗又出现在天安门城楼上。在天安门两侧，红底金色的欢迎志愿军凯旋的巨大标语突出地展现在人们的眼前：“中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！”当杨勇上将、王平上将分乘敞篷汽车经过天安门时，千万双手越过人头，不断挥舞，欢迎最可爱的人。
    祖国人民的隆重欢迎，大大鼓舞了志愿军的英雄们。他们表示今后要在建设和保卫祖国的事业中，贡献出自己的全部力量。曾经在金城反击战中立过功的二级战斗英雄王占山说：我今后一定要好好工作，来报答祖国对我的爱护。他还说：美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，干涉我国的内政，我们将随时准备着响应祖国号召，为解放台湾而战斗。
