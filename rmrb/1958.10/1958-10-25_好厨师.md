The members of the Huanglou North Production Team's first canteen in the Fenghuo People's Commune, Xiangqin County, Shanxi Province, smile from ear to ear when they eat their meals, saying, "This food is really delicious! Old Man Lian Genwang truly deserves to be called a good cook."

Old Man Lian Genwang's cooking methods involve "one saving," "four diligences," and "five attentions." "One saving" means: saving at all times and in all places. "Four diligences" are: diligent in watching the fire, diligent in watching the pot, diligent in maintaining hygiene, and diligent in researching improvements. "Five attentions" are: when making rice porridge, pay attention to: adding the rice after the water boils, using high heat to boil the rice until it blossoms, and then using weak coal to keep the fire steady. When making noodles, pay attention to: kneading the dough hard and evenly, rolling it thin, and cutting it finely. When steaming buns, pay attention to: fermenting the dough thoroughly, adding less unfermented dough, and using an appropriate amount of alkali. When making dishes, pay attention to: cutting them finely and adding enough seasonings. When making mixed grain rice, pay attention to: adding more water, adding the rice early, and simmering slowly over low heat.

In the twenty-three days that Old Man Lian Genwang has been a cook, he has saved a total of more than 130 jin of rice and flour, 1,300 jin of coal, and 20 jin of seasonings.

    好厨师
    山西襄沁县烽火人民公社黄楼北生产队第一食堂的社员们，一端碗吃饭，就眉开眼笑地说：“这饭真好吃呀！连根旺老汉真不愧是个好厨师”。
    连根旺老汉的做饭方法有一省、四勤、五注意。一省是：时时处处要节省。四勤是：勤看火、勤看锅、勤讲卫生、勤研究改进。五注意是：做米粥要注意：水开了就下米，用大火把米煮得开了花，再用稀煤把火压严。做面条要注意：把面和硬、和匀，赶薄、切细。蒸馍要注意：多发酵面，少掺接面，上合适碱。做菜要注意：细细切，加足调料。做和子饭要注意：多添水、早下米，小火慢慢熬。
    从连根旺老汉当厨师的二十三天，共节约米面一百三十多斤，煤炭一千三百斤，调料二十斤。
