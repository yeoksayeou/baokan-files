    Victory Song of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Guo Moruo

	A rain of flowers showers down as never before,
	The most beloved people now return in triumph.
	The mountains of Pyongyang roar with cheers that shake the earth,
	The waves of Fengcheng surge, stirring the heavens.
	Red flags line the road, dancing in the wind,
	Noble deeds remain, spreading beyond our borders.
	Drink water, remember the source, credit goes to the Party,
	May the people's leader live ten thousand years.

		October 28, 1958

    志愿军凯歌
    郭沫若迎头花雨洒空前，最可爱人今凯旋。平壤山呼犹动地，凤城海啸又掀天。红旗夹道风中舞，青简留芳域外传。饮水思源功在党，人民领袖万斯年。
