Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 15th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 15th that the Soviet Foreign Ministry released a memorandum from the Soviet government to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the 14th. The memorandum points out that the West German government has been obstructing the development of relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union and is constantly engaging in anti-Soviet propaganda. The memorandum hopes that the West German government will take the necessary measures to gradually improve relations between the two countries.

The memorandum points out that opportunities to improve relations between the two countries have not been fully utilized. For a long time, the West German government has repeatedly delayed negotiations on signing cultural and scientific-technical exchange agreements and has continuously obstructed the strengthening of contacts between government officials and political activists of the two countries. The initiatives proposed by the Soviet side to implement measures that had been previously agreed upon have also often been opposed by the West German authorities.

The memorandum states that the tendency displayed by this policy of the West German government is not only hindering the development of relations between the two countries but also carries the risk of relations regressing to the state they were in several years ago. The memorandum cites many facts to illustrate that West Germany is constantly engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda. The memorandum emphasizes that during an inspection of Federal Armed Forces exercises a few days ago, the commander of the West German armed forces, Heusinger, said that West German troops must be trained to perform the tasks that the Hitler Wehrmacht undertook in the last war. Although the provocative nature of this statement is so blatant, it has not been condemned in any way by the West German federal government.

The memorandum then points out that the Soviet government cannot ignore the numerous statements by official spokesmen of the West German government, which imply that the further development of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany depends, in effect, on whether the Soviet government can assist the West German government to some extent in its schemes to interfere in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic.

The memorandum emphasizes that it is completely unrealistic to expect the Soviet government to carry out any interference in the internal affairs of the German Democratic Republic in order to cater to the tastes of the West German ruling circles. The Soviet Union will never establish relations with any country on this basis.

    苏联政府指责西德当局进行反苏宣传
    希望西德政府采取措施改善两国关系
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联外交部发表了苏联政府14日给德意志联邦共和国政府的一项备忘录。备忘录指出，西德政府一直在阻挠发展西德和苏联的关系，而且在不断进行反苏宣传。备忘录希望西德政府采取必要的措施，以便有可能逐步改善两国之间的关系。
    备忘录指出，改善两国关系的机会远没有充分利用。长时期以来，西德政府一再拖延关于签订文化和科学技术交流协定的谈判，不断阻挠加强两国政府人士和政治活动家的接触。苏联方面为实现早先已取得协议的措施而提出的倡议，也常常遭到西德当局的反对。
    备忘录说，西德政府的这种政策所表现的倾向不仅是在阻挠两国关系的发展，而且有使两国关系倒退到几年以前那种状况的危险。备忘录举出许多事实，说明西德经常不断地在进行反苏宣传。备忘录着重指出，西德武装部队司令豪辛格前几天在视察联邦国防军演习时说，必须训练西德军队，使之执行希特勒国防军在上一次战争中所担负的那些任务。这个声明的挑衅性质虽然是这样露骨，然而却没有受到西德联邦政府的任何谴责。
    备忘录接着指出，苏联政府对于西德政府官方发言人的多次声明不能置若罔闻，这些声明的意思是说，苏联和西德两国关系的进一步发展，实际上取决于苏联政府在某种程度上是否能协助西德政府进行干涉民主德国内政的勾当。
    备忘录强调说，指望苏联政府为迎合西德统治集团的口胃而对民主德国的内政进行某种干涉，这是完全不现实的。苏联永远不会在这种基础上同任何国家建立关系。
