Popularization Breeds Experts
Zhang Pei

Contradiction, or the struggle of opposites, always runs through the development process of everything, especially when new things appear. This is no exception to the current upsurge of philosophy popularization, the study of philosophy by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the nationwide study of philosophy.

It is said that some philosophy experts look down on popularization and do not believe that uneducated workers and peasants can master philosophy—even if they do, it will only be nagging and vulgarized. Some people fly into a rage at the mention of theory linking with practice and deeply detest it. They stand on the sidelines, watching coldly and making critical remarks during the popularization of philosophy.

In fact, the popularization of philosophy does not need this kind of philosophy expert. Just imagine, when workers, peasants, and soldiers are studying philosophy, what use can experts who constantly quote ancient Greece and never leave Kant, or dogmatists who recite dialectical materialism as a six-character mantra, possibly have?! They always go from books to books, like Sun Wukong unable to escape the palm of the Buddha. It is said that Mr. Feng Youlan created a formula: "Theory - Practice - Theory." In my opinion, this formula does not reflect the ideological essence of these experts, because the formula of these experts is only "Theory - Theory," and the middle term "Practice" can never be found. Adding this term is just a trick to deceive the eye. They have always been floating in the air, never touching the ground. — This faction is a downright fake expert.

However, there is another kind of expert, a true Marxist-Leninist philosophy expert, a true expert who is both red and expert. They are either workers, peasants, and soldiers who have rapidly grown up through popularization, or although they are not workers, peasants, and soldiers, they can combine with workers and peasants and vigorously engage in popularization work; thus, in the process of vigorously engaging in popularization, they gradually become true philosophy experts.

Why can popularization breed experts?

For workers, peasants, and soldiers, in their rich experience of production struggles and class struggles, there is originally a rich source of philosophy. Once they realize that this is philosophy, they have found the source. They discover inexhaustible philosophical principles in their actual lives. Therefore, they can not only learn, learn well, use, and use well, but also teach and teach well. This is the new force, the new philosophy experts, that have grown out of popularization.

For intellectuals, as long as they can closely integrate with workers and peasants and vigorously engage in popularization work, they can gain rich life experiences, be among the masses, and share the same breath with workers and peasants. By learning from the masses and concentrating the wisdom of the masses, they can obtain the "true scripture" of Marxist-Leninist philosophy among the masses, making them true philosophy experts.

In fact, the truth is simple. A tree cannot live without soil, water cannot grow without a source, thoughts are not real without life, and theories are not true without practice. The exhaustion of fake experts lies in this, and the vitality of true experts also lies in this. Here are two attitudes, two paths, two futures, and two different results. It embodies the struggle of ideological confrontation in real life, the struggle of promotion and hindrance, which is enough to give people food for thought.

Therefore, everyone who truly wants to become a true philosophy expert who is both red and expert, including fake experts, should devote themselves to the popularization of philosophy and vigorously engage in the popularization of philosophy. In the process of popularization, let themselves find soil and find the source.

### 普及出专家

    普及出专家
    章沛
    矛盾，或者说，对立面的斗争，总是贯串于一切事物的发展过程中，尤其是当新东西出现的时候。这对于当前的哲学普及、工农学哲学、全民学哲学的热潮来说，也毫不例外。
    据说，有一种哲学专家是瞧不起普及的，也不相信工农大老粗能够掌握哲学——即使掌握了，也不过婆婆妈妈、庸俗化。也有人闻理论联系实际而怒发冲冠，深恶痛绝。他们在哲学的普及当中，站在一边冷眼旁观，指手划脚。
    其实，哲学的普及工作也并不需要这种哲学专家的。试想，在工农学哲学的时候，言必称希腊、语不离康德的专家，或者把辩证唯物主义当六字真经念的教条主义者，又能派什么用场？！他们永远从书本到书本，有如孙悟空离不开如来佛的掌心。听说冯友兰先生创造了一个公式：“理论—实际—理论”。这个公式据我看来，并不反映这种专家们的思想实质，因为这种专家们的公式只是“理论—理论”，断乎找不到“实际”这一中项。安上这一项，遮眼法而已。他们从来就是飘飘然，脚不沾地的。——这一派，是地地道道的假专家。
    然而，也有另一种专家，这是真正的马克思列宁主义的哲学专家，是又红又专的真专家。他们，或者是工农群众，自普及当中迅速长成，或者虽然不是工农群众，但能够与工农相结合，大搞其普及工作；因而也就在大搞普及当中，逐渐成为真正的哲学专家。
    为什么普及能出专家呢？
    对于工农群众来说，在他们的丰富的生产斗争经验及阶级斗争经验中，原来就有着丰富的哲学源泉，一旦他们认识了这就是哲学之后，就算是找到源头了，他们在自己的实际生活中发现有着取之不尽、用之不竭的哲学道理。因此，他们不单能学、学得好，能用、用得好，而且还能教，教得好。这就是从普及中生长出来的新力量，新哲学专家。
    对于知识分子来说，只要他能和工农紧密结合，大搞普及工作，他就能获得丰富的生活体验，处于群众之中，与工农同呼吸。他以群众为师，集中群众的智慧，就能在群众中取得马克思列宁主义哲学的“真经”，使他成为真正的哲学专家。
    其实，道理是浅显的。没有泥土的树不活，没有源头的水不长，没有生活的思想不实，没有实际的理论不真。假专家之枯竭以此，真专家之生气勃勃亦以此。这里是两种态度，两条道路，两个前途，两样结果。体现了现实生活中的思想对抗的斗争，促进与促退的斗争，足以发人深省。
    因此，一切愿意真正成为又红又专的哲学真专家的人，也包括假专家在内，都应该投身于哲学的普及工作，大搞哲学普及工作。在普及当中，让自己找到泥土、找到源泉。
