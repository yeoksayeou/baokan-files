Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 22nd: The people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, working together with one heart and fighting hard day and night, achieved an unprecedented victory on the 20th, producing 192,459 tons of pig iron, 94,079 tons of sintered iron, and 3,659 tons of steel in a single day. The pig iron output alone is equivalent to the total pig iron production of the entire province in the past two years.

On this day, Da Fang, Pan County, Zunyi, and Xishui counties each produced more than 20,000 tons of iron; Tongzi, Jinsha, Zhijin, and Renhuai counties each produced more than 10,000 tons; and Shuicheng, Fenggang, Daozhen, Qianxi, Bijie, Zhengan, Nayong, Yuqing, Meitan, Suiyang, Sinan, Chishui, and Weining thirteen counties and Guiyang city each produced more than 1,000 tons.

After Guizhou Province overfulfilled its annual pig iron production plan at the end of September, the people of all ethnic groups decided to produce another 500,000 tons of pig iron for the country by the end of the year. In the past twenty days, more than two million people in the province have been directly involved in the steel and iron front. In twenty days, the province produced a total of 244,493 tons of pig iron, more than double the total output from January to September.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd: Since the high-yield campaign for steel and iron production began in Henan Province on the 15th, it has developed rapidly with unstoppable momentum. From the 15th to the 20th, the province's pig iron production was: 23,318 tons on the 15th, 26,040 tons on the 16th, 30,332 tons on the 17th, 37,331 tons on the 18th, 48,122 tons on the 19th, and 48,368 tons on the 20th. From the 15th to the 21st, the province's average daily steel production also increased from more than 1,000 tons to more than 4,000 tons, with the highest reaching 8,809 tons on the 16th.

The most significant feature of this high-yield campaign for steel and iron is that the number of advanced counties is increasing. In recent days, eighteen counties and cities in the province have broken the 1,000-ton mark for daily pig iron production.

Around the start of the high-yield campaign for steel and iron in Henan Province, all parts of the province experienced strong winds and heavy rain, and temperatures dropped sharply. Some areas even experienced light snow. However, the more than six million steel and iron troops, full of fighting spirit, fought hard day and night in the wind and snow, ensuring that thousands of small blast furnaces continued to produce normally in the wind and rain.

Starting in late September, Henan Province made full preparations for the high-yield campaign for steel and iron in terms of fuel, raw materials, transportation, and furnace construction. Since the beginning of October, more than 500,000 vehicles, more than 10,000 mules, and more than 9,000 tugboats and wooden sailboats have been transporting materials to the steel and iron front day and night.

Currently, steel and iron production in various parts of Henan Province is developing in the direction of production baseization, furnace cluster factoryization, furnace grouping, and team specialization.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 22nd: In the one day from 12:00 noon on the 18th to 12:00 noon on the 19th, Yunnan Province produced 1,980 tons of steel (plus 2,725 tons of indigenous steel produced in Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture and other places); 39,628 tons of pig iron (including the poorer quality iron selected from the iron smelting kilns); and 317.8 tons of copper.

Starting in early October, Party organizations at all levels conducted strong political and ideological education work among the masses. By the 18th, more than 3.7 million people in the province had been投入 (thrown into) the steel and copper battlefront, building nearly 70,000 indigenous iron smelting furnaces and more than 30,000 indigenous iron smelting kilns. From noon on the 18th to noon on the 19th, Kunming City's steel output reached 1,502 tons; Rongfeng, Luoping, Fuyuan, Kunming and other counties and cities produced more than 1,000 tons of iron. In recent days, one hundred and seven thousand people have been投入 (thrown into) the battle every day in the province in the area of copper smelting alone.

Since the 16th, Yunnan Province has experienced continuous rainy weather and falling temperatures, but the fighting spirit of the more than 3.7 million steel and iron warriors has remained very high. After a tenacious struggle, they ensured that the vast majority of furnaces did not go out or collapse.

    在完成全年计划以后，20日再获空前胜利
    贵州一天产铁十九万吨
    河南六天来日日高产　云南钢铁铜三路报捷
    据新华社贵阳22日电　贵州省各族人民同心协力，日夜苦战，20日取得了日产生铁十九万二千四百五十九吨、烧结铁九万四千零七十九吨、钢三千六百五十九吨的空前胜利。仅生铁产量一项，就相当于过去两年全省生铁的总产量。
    这一天，产铁两万吨以上的有大方、盘县、遵义、鳛水四个县；万吨以上的有桐梓、金沙、织金、仁怀四个县；千吨以上的有水城、凤冈、道真、黔西、毕节、正安、纳雍、余庆、湄潭、绥阳、思南、赤水、威宁十三个县和贵阳市。
    贵州省自9月底超额完成全年生铁生产计划以后，各族人民决定到年底再给国家生产五十万吨生铁。近二十天来全省有二百多万人直接投入钢铁前线。在二十天内，全省共生产了二十四万四千四百九十三吨生铁，比1月至9月份的总产量增加了一倍多。
    据新华社郑州22日电　河南省钢铁生产从15日开展高产运动以来，以破竹之势猛烈发展。从15日到20日，全省的生铁产量是：15日二万三千三百一十八吨，16日二万六千零四十吨，17日三万零三百三十二吨，18日三万七千三百三十一吨，19日四万八千一百二十二吨，20日四万八千三百六十八吨。15日到21日，全省钢的平均日产量也由以前的一千多吨提高到四千多吨，最高的16日曾达到八千八百零九吨。
    这次钢铁高产运动的显著特点是：先进县越来越多，全省在最近几天，有十八个县、市都突破了生铁日产千吨关。
    河南省钢铁高产运动开始前后，全省各地都遇到大风大雨，气温急剧下降，有些地区还降了小雪。但是六百多万钢铁大军，斗志昂扬，在风雪交加中，白天黑夜艰苦奋战，终于使千万个炼铁小高炉，在风雨中照常生产。
    9月下旬起，河南省就在燃料、原料、运输、建炉等方面为钢铁高产运动作充分的准备。进入10月份以来，全省有五十多万辆车，一万多头驮骡，九千多只拖轮、木帆船等，日夜向钢铁战线运输物资。
    目前，河南省各地钢铁生产正在向生产基地化、炉群工厂化、炉子成组化、队伍专业化的方向发展。
    据新华社昆明22日电　从18日中午十二时至19日中午十二时的一天中，云南省生产了钢一千九百八十吨（另有红河哈尼族彝族自治州等地生产的土钢二千七百二十五吨）；生铁三万九千六百二十八吨
  （其中包括从炼铁窑中挑选出来的质量较差的铁）；铜三百一十七点八吨。
    从10月上旬起，各级党组织在广大群众中进行了强有力的政治思想教育工作，到18日，全省已有三百七十多万人投入钢铁铜战线，建成近七万个土炼铁炉和三万多座土炼铁窑。在18日中午至19日中午，昆明市钢产量已经达到一千五百零二吨；榕峰、罗平、富源、昆明等县市都产铁千吨以上。最近几天来全省单是炼铜方面，每天都有一百零七万人投入战斗。
    16日以来，云南省连日阴雨，气温下降，但是三百七十多万钢铁战士的战斗情绪始终非常饱满，经过顽强搏斗，保证了绝大部分炉子不熄火、不倒塌。
