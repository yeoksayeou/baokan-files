    In an Instant, Golden River Transforms into Golden Mountain
    Looking from afar, Golden River surges in great waves,
    Looking up close, the foxtail millet grows past the shoulders,
    The harvest rush teams battle under the moonlight,
    In an instant, Golden River transforms into Golden Mountain.
              ——Ningxia

    霎时金川变金山
    远看金川大浪翻，
    近看糜谷长过肩，
    抢收大队月下战，
    霎时金川变金山。
              ——宁夏
