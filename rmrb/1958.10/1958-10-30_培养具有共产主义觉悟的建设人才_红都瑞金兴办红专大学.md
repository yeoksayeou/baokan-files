Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 28th: The Red Capital of Ruijin County is establishing a new type of Red and Expert University. This university was founded by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition and cultivate construction talents with communist consciousness. The university is located in Shazhouba, the former site of the Central Democratic Government, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao founded many revolutionary schools such as the Soviet University, the Marxism School, the Workers' and Peasants' Red and Expert School, and the Lenin Normal School, which trained a large number of outstanding cadres loyal to the proletarian revolutionary cause for the Party.

The Red and Expert University follows the Party's policy of education serving politics and combining education with productive labor, resolutely implements the proletarian educational line, and practices diligence and thrift in education, and part-work part-study. The study period is tentatively set at four years. The first year of the school's establishment will focus on socialist ideological education, combined with cultural education and productive labor; after the second year, departments and majors such as philosophy, literature and history, industry, and agronomy will be established. Throughout the entire teaching process, Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies will always be the most basic courses.

The president of the Red and Expert University is Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The school stipulates that 600 new students will be enrolled this year. The main targets are outstanding young workers, peasants, demobilized young soldiers, children of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and outstanding members of the Communist Youth League and young people in urban and rural areas who have a junior high school education.

At present, all preparations for the Red and Expert University are ready. New, practical, and beautiful school buildings have begun construction to the left of the former Soviet Central Auditorium in Shazhouba and are expected to open in mid-November.

    培养具有共产主义觉悟的建设人才
    红都瑞金兴办红专大学
    新华社南昌28日电　红都瑞金县正在兴办一所新型的红专大学。这所大学是中共江西省委为了继承和发扬革命传统，培养具有共产主义觉悟的建设人才而创办的。红专大学的校址设在前中央民主政府所在地——沙洲坝，党中央和毛主席曾在这里创办过苏维埃大学、马克思主义学校、工农红专学校、列宁师范等许多革命学校，为党培养了大批的忠于无产阶级革命事业的优秀干部。
    红专大学遵循着党的教育为政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，坚决贯彻无产阶级的办学路线，实行勤工俭学，半工半读。学习年限暂定为四年，建校第一年以社会主义思想教育为主，结合进行文化教育和生产劳动；第二年后分别建立哲学、文史、工业、农艺等系和专业。在整个教学过程中，将始终以毛主席的著作和党的方针政策为最基本的课程。
    红专大学校长由中共江西省委书记方志纯兼任。学校规定今年招收新生六百名。主要招收具有初中毕业文化程度的优秀青年工人、农民、青年复员军人、烈军属子女及城乡优秀共青团员和青年。
    目前，红专大学的各项筹备工作已经就绪，适用、美观的新校舍已在沙洲坝前苏维埃中央大礼堂左侧动工兴建，预计在11月中旬可开学。
