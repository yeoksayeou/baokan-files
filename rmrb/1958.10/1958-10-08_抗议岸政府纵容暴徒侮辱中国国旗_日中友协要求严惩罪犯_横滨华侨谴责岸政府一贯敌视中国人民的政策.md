Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. The Japan-China Friendship Association held an enlarged meeting of its national board of directors today to discuss how to promote the Japan-China friendship movement in the current situation of tension in the Taiwan Strait region due to American aggression and war threats.

    The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of protest against the Japanese government and the Yokohama police authorities for condoning thugs tearing down the Chinese national flag and deliberately delaying the investigation of the criminals' responsibility.

    The letter of protest demanded that the Japanese authorities concerned take active measures to arrest and severely punish the criminals who insulted the Chinese national flag in Yokohama, and try to resolve the incident of thugs insulting the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki as soon as possible.

    All participants in the meeting unanimously welcomed the Japanese Arts Council's suspension of the plan to invite the Chiang gang Peking Opera troupe from Taiwan to perform in Japan. The Japanese Arts Council formally notified the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and other Japan-China friendship groups of this decision this afternoon.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that it was the strong opposition of the Japanese people and Japanese public opinion that forced the organizers to abandon their original plan, and that this was a victory of the people's power over the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in culture. All participants unanimously stated that they will continue to fight to the end to smash the conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in sports and other fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th. The Yokohama Overseas Chinese Celebration of National Day Committee issued a statement on the 6th regarding the incident on September 30th in which thugs in Yokohama tore down the Chinese national flag, demanding that the Yokohama police authorities urgently return the Chinese national flag and punish the criminals according to law.

    The Yokohama Overseas Chinese had been preparing to hold a celebration banquet for Chinese National Day on the evening of September 30th at the Taipinglou Restaurant in Chinatown, Yamashita-cho, Yokohama. The person in charge of the Overseas Chinese informed the responsible Kagacho Police Station on the same day about hanging two Chinese national flags in front of the window on the second floor of the Taipinglou Restaurant, and requested protection. However, not long after the national flags were hung up at around 1:00 pm, five or six thugs suddenly tore down one of the national flags while Japanese police watched.

    The statement pointed out that the police witnessed the thugs tearing down the Chinese national flag on the spot, and the matter was so obvious, but there has been no whereabouts of the perpetrators to date, which is a deliberate delay in investigation.

    The statement pointed out that this is clearly another act by the Kishi Nobusuke government, since the incident of thugs insulting the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki, to deliberately protect thugs who insult the Chinese national flag and are hostile to our motherland.

    The statement pointed out that on October 1st, the Yokohama Kagacho Police Station again violated its previous agreement and canceled the Yokohama Overseas Chinese's permit for a dragon dance parade to celebrate National Day, and sent more than 200 armed police officers to surround the dragon dance team and prevent them from departing, obstructing and threatening the Overseas Chinese's legitimate activities of loving their motherland and celebrating National Day.

    The statement pointed out that the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag and the measures to prohibit the dragon dance are concrete manifestations of the Kishi Nobusuke government's consistent policy of antagonism towards the Chinese people.

    The statement stated that the Yokohama Overseas Chinese are extremely angry at the Japanese police authorities' delay in handling the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag and their illegal oppression of the patriotic actions of the Overseas Chinese.

    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会今天举行全国理事会扩大会议，讨论了在由于美国的侵略和战争威胁而形成的台湾海峡地区的紧张形势的目前，如何推进日中友好运动的问题。
    会议一致通过了抗议书，抗议日本政府和横滨警察有关当局纵容暴徒扯下中国国旗，并且故意拖延追究罪犯的责任。
    抗议书要求日本有关当局采取积极措施逮捕和严惩在横滨侮辱中国国旗的罪犯，并且设法尽速解决长崎暴徒侮辱中国国旗的事件。
    会议的全体与会者一致对日本艺术会议停止执行邀请台湾蒋帮京剧团到日本演出的计划表示欢迎。日本艺术会议已经在今日下午把这个决定正式通知日中友好协会和日中文化交流协会等日中友好团体。
    会议一致认为，这是日本人民和日本舆论强烈的反对才迫使主办团体无法执行原定的计划，这是人民的力量战胜了企图在文化上制造“两个中国”的阴谋。全体与会者一致表示，他们将继续为粉碎在体育和其他方面制造“两个中国”的阴谋而斗争到底。
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：横滨华侨庆祝国庆节委员会6日就9月30日横滨暴徒扯走中国国旗事件发表声明，要求横滨警察当局急速追还中国国旗，并且依法惩办罪犯。
    横滨华侨曾筹备在9月30日晚上在横滨市山下町中华街的太平楼举行庆祝中国国庆宴会。华侨的负责人当天就把在会场太平楼二楼窗前悬挂两面中国国旗的事通知了主管的加贺町警察署，并且要求给予保护。但是在下午一时许悬挂国旗以后不久，突有暴徒五、六人在日本警察目睹下将国旗扯走一面。
    声明指出，暴徒扯走中国国旗时，警察是当场看见的，事情如此明显，但至今尚无下落，这是故意拖延不进行追究。
    声明指出，这分明是自从发生暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗的事件以来，岸信介政府又一次有意识地庇护暴徒侮辱中国国旗、敌视我们祖国的行为。
    声明指出，横滨加贺町警察署10月1日又违反前约，取消了横滨华侨为庆祝国庆节而举行的舞龙游行的许可，并且派出二百多名武装警察包围舞龙队，阻止他们出发，对华侨热爱祖国、欢度国庆节的正当活动进行阻挠和威胁。
    声明指出，侮辱中国国旗的事件和禁止舞龙的措施，都是岸信介政府一贯敌视中国人民的政策的具体表现。
    声明表示，横滨华侨对于日本警察当局延不处理侮辱中国国旗的事件和对华侨爱国行动的非法压迫感到极大的愤怒。
