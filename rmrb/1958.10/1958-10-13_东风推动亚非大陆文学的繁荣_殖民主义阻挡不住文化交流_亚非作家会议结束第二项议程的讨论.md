Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent Dispatch: The Asian-African Writers' Conference held a plenary session from the morning of the 11th to discuss the second item on the agenda: the mutual relations of the cultures of the Asian and African peoples and their connections with Western culture. The discussion of this item on the agenda concluded on the evening of the 11th. Representatives from a total of fifteen countries spoke.

The representatives of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, Japan, China, the United Arab Republic, India, Afghanistan, Senegal, and Democratic Korea spoke at the morning session on the 11th. Japanese representative Kato Shuichi said at the meeting that the development of Japanese art is closely related to China, and China has had a profound influence on Japanese religion, morality, culture, and politics. He said that the issue of opposing colonialism is also related to Japanese writers. Even now, there are forces that want to drag Japan onto the path of colonialism, but Japanese writers oppose this colonialist force.

Indian representative Kumar Sanial said that the era of Western rule in Asia and Africa has ended, and colonialism is dying. Establishing close ties between Eastern and Western cultures can bring happiness and joy to mankind.

United Arab Republic representative Mohammed Halaf said that Arab culture was one of the great cultures of the world in ancient times, and cultural workers in the United Arab Republic are now expanding their international contacts.

Afghan representative Khalili said that the Afghan government and people desire world peace and are always ready to expand international friendly relations.

Senegalese writer Ousmane said that since imperialism "descended" on Africa, Africa's ancient culture has been destroyed. He said that although the ocean separates us from some Asian and African countries, we are still the closest friends.

Also speaking at the meeting on the 11th was the conference's guest, the famous peace fighter, and African-American writer W.E.B. Du Bois. He said that the death of colonialism is now imminent, and imperialism can never get out of the dead end.

Du Bois believes that it is necessary to carry out cultural exchanges between East and West, and mutual visits by writers from various countries can expand their knowledge. For example, African writers can go not only to the United States and Britain, but also to the Soviet Union and China.

Today, the participants warmly welcomed a group of writers from Mozambique, the Ivory Coast, and Madagascar in Africa. The meeting read out a congratulatory telegram from Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah. United Arab Republic President Nasser also sent a congratulatory telegram yesterday.

Writers from Algeria, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Madagascar, and India spoke at the afternoon and evening sessions on the 11th.

Algerian writer Garli said that before the arrival of French colonialists, Algerian culture was prosperous. After the colonialists arrived, they closed schools and banned the teaching of Algerian languages. But the Algerian people will never compromise with the forces that attack their national culture and national characteristics. Only when the Algerian people win in the liberation struggle can its national culture shine. In the struggle, we are by no means isolated; the Asian and African people are united with us.

Sudanese representative Zarouk said that although we have suffered from the scourge of Western colonialism, we still believe that we should utilize Western culture. He suggested strengthening the connections between the people of various continents and taking the development of such connections as our fundamental task.

Vietnamese writer Pham Huy Thong said that the East wind is now blowing stronger than the West wind. The historical task of Asian and African writers is to fight to maintain the pride of their nations. We should call on the Asian and African people to unite and oppose colonialism.

Soviet Azerbaijani Republic writer Hussein said at the meeting that Soviet writers are members of a large family, and within this family, all writers have made their contributions. The common goal of Soviet writers is to serve the people, and in Soviet literature, all racism, hatred of humanity and the world, and the promotion of nationalism are opposed. He said that when heroic people are waiting for help in the struggle against reactionary forces and colonialism, people should not remain silent.

Cambodian writer Maliken said that Eastern and Western cultures will always exist and will continue to develop. Eastern and Western cultures should coexist harmoniously and influence each other equally.

Madagascar representative Rabenoro said that we are united, although our cultural development is different. Our task is to strengthen our friendship and mutual assistance so that our unity is even stronger.

Indian representative Chatterjee emphasized that people living anywhere can create great spiritual wealth.

Chilean poet Koleny and Italian writer Mucci also spoke at the meeting.

After the speeches, the discussion of the second item on the agenda was declared over.

The conference adjourned for one day on the 12th. On this day, writers from various countries will be invited to visit collective farms and visit the homes of Uzbek writers as guests. The closing ceremony will be held on the 13th.

    东风推动亚非大陆文学的繁荣
    殖民主义阻挡不住文化交流
    亚非作家会议结束第二项议程的讨论
    本报综合报道　据新华社塔什干电：亚非作家会议从11日上午起举行全体会议讨论第二项议程：亚非各国人民文化的相互关系及其与西方文化的联系。这项议程的讨论已于11日晚上结束。一共有十五个国家的代表发言。
    在11日上午会议上讲话的有苏联的塔吉克共和国、日本、中国、阿联、印度、阿富汗、塞内加尔、民主朝鲜等国的代表。日本代表加藤周一在会上说，日本艺术的开展是和中国有密切联系的，中国对日本的宗教、道德、文化和政治都有深刻的影响。他说，反对殖民主义的问题也与日本作家有关。直到现在，还有某种力量想把日本拖到殖民主义道路上去，但是，日本作家反对这种殖民主义的力量。
    印度代表库马尔·萨尼尔说，西方统治亚洲和非洲的时代已经结束，殖民主义正在死亡。建立东西方文化之间紧密的联系能够给人类带来幸福与快乐。
    阿联代表穆罕默德·哈拉夫说，阿拉伯文化在古代是世界伟大文化之一，阿联的文化工作者现在正在扩大自己的国际联系。
    阿富汗代表卡利利说，阿富汗政府和人民愿望世界和平并随时准备扩大国际友好联系。
    塞内加尔作家乌斯曼说，自从帝国主义“驾临”了非洲，非洲的古老文化就遭受破坏。他说，海洋虽然把我们和一些亚非国家分隔开，但是，我们仍然是最亲密的朋友。
  在11日会议上讲话的还有会议的来宾、著名和平战士、美国黑人作家杜波依斯。他说，现在，殖民主义的死亡已是指日可待了，帝国主义决不能从死胡同里走出来。
    杜波依斯认为有必要进行东西方文化的交流，各国作家的互相访问可以扩充自己的知识。例如非洲作家，不但可以到美国和英国，而且可以到苏联和中国去。
    今天，与会者热烈欢迎了来自非洲莫三鼻给、象牙海岸、马达加斯加的一批作家。会上宣读了加纳总理恩克鲁玛的贺电。阿联总统纳赛尔在昨天也发来了贺电。
    在11日下午和晚上的会上发言的有阿尔及利亚、苏丹、越南民主共和国、阿塞拜疆、柬埔寨、马达加斯加、印度等国的作家。
    阿尔及利亚作家加尔利说，在法国殖民主义者到来之前，阿尔及利亚的文化是繁荣的。殖民主义者来到以后就关闭学校，禁止教授阿尔及利亚语言。但是阿尔及利亚人民决不向进攻自己的民族文化及民族特点的力量妥协。只有阿尔及利亚人民在解放斗争中获得胜利，它的民族文化才能发出光芒。在斗争中，我们绝不是孤立的，亚非人民和我们团结在一起。
    苏丹代表扎鲁克说，我们虽然遭到了西方殖民主义的祸害，但是我们仍然认为应该利用西方文化。他建议加强各大洲人民间的联系，并且以开展这种联系作为我们的根本任务。
    越南作家范辉通说，东风现在比西风吹得更猛烈。亚非作家的历史任务是为维护自己民族的自豪感而斗争。我们应该号召亚非人民团结起来，反对殖民主义。
    苏联阿塞拜疆共和国作家古谢因在会上说，苏联作家是一个大家庭的成员，在这个大家庭内，所有的作家都作出了自己的贡献。苏联作家的共同目的是为人民服务，在苏联文学中、所有种族主义、对人类和世界的憎恨、民族主义的宣传，都受到反对。他说，当英勇的人民在反对反动势力和殖民主义的斗争中等待帮助的时候，人们不应该沉默。
    柬埔寨作家马列肯说，东西方文化永远存在，而且将不断发展。东西方文化应该和谐地共存，平等地相互影响。
    马达加斯加代表拉伯诺罗说，我们是团结的，虽然我们的文化发展情况不一样。我们的任务就是加强我们的友谊和互助，使我们的团结更加有力量。
    印度代表查特吉强调指出，不管住在什么地方的人都能创造出伟大的精神财富。
    智利诗人科勒尼和意大利作家穆契也在会上发了言。
    发言完毕后，第二项议程的讨论就宣告结束。
    会议在12日休会一天。这一天各国作家将应邀访问集体农庄和到乌兹别克作家家中作客。13日举行闭幕式。
