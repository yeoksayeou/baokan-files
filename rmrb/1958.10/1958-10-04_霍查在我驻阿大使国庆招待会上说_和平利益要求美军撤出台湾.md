Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 2nd. Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, said at the reception held by the Chinese Ambassador to Albania, Luo Shigao, on the evening of the 1st to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the founding of our country, that we once again declare that we fully support China's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands, and demand that US imperialism stop its brutal interference in China's internal affairs and its military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.

Also attending the reception were Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu, other party and government leaders, heads of various people's organizations, and more than 200 representatives from all walks of life.

In his speech, Hoxha pointed out that the United States has adopted a policy of playing with fire in the Far East, and its absurd proposal of so-called "ceasefire" is merely a trick to legitimize the occupation of Chinese territory and expand its aggression against China.

Hoxha emphasized that China has become a strong fortress in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has made valuable contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and defending world peace.

Hoxha pointed out that the Soviet Union and all socialist countries fully support the Chinese government's struggle to defend its legitimate rights to Taiwan and other coastal islands, and believe that an attack on China is an attack on the entire socialist camp and all progressive mankind. This will cost imperialism a heavy price. The interests of peace demand that the United States immediately withdraw its troops from the Taiwan Strait area.

In his speech, Hoxha also pointed out that restoring China's seat in the United Nations is its legitimate right. Because everyone knows that no major international issues can be resolved today without the participation of the Chinese giant. In his speech, Hoxha gave extremely high praise to the achievements made by the Chinese people in the past nine years. He said that we regard China's brilliant achievements as our own achievements. Because these achievements have further strengthened the socialist camp and consolidated the socialist cause, and are a huge contribution to the cause of peace.

In his speech, Hoxha also condemned modern revisionism. He pointed out that the imperialists and their servants, the revisionists of Belgrade, who are trying to split the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international workers' movement, will never achieve their goals.

    霍查在我驻阿大使国庆招待会上说
    和平利益要求美军撤出台湾
    新华社地拉那2日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查1日晚间在我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使罗士高举行的庆祝我国建国九周年的招待会上说，我们再一次声明，我们全力支持中国解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争，要求美帝国主义停止粗暴地干涉中国内政和在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅行为。
    参加这次招待会的还有阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡以及其他党政领导人、各人民团体的负责人和各界代表二百多人。
    霍查在讲话中指出，美国在远东采取了玩火的政策，它提出的荒谬的所谓“停火”的主张只不过是想使侵占中国领土的行为合法化和扩大对中国的侵略的诡计。
    霍查强调指出，中国已经成为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中的一个强大的堡垒，它在加强社会主义阵营团结和保卫世界和平的事业中作出了宝贵的贡献。
    霍查指出，苏联和所有社会主义国家完全支持中国政府保卫它对台湾和其他沿海岛屿的合法权利的斗争，并且认为，进攻中国就是进攻整个社会主义阵营和全体进步人类。而这将使帝国主义付出重大的代价。和平的利益要求美国军队立即撤出台湾海峡地区。
    霍查在讲话中还指出，恢复中国在联合国的席位是它的合法权利。因为大家都知道，今天没有中国巨人的参加就不能解决重大的国际问题。霍查在讲话中对中国人民在九年期间所获得的成就给与了极高的评价。他说，我们把中国的辉煌成就当作我们自己的成就。因为这些成就进一步加强了社会主义阵营和巩固了社会主义事业，并且是对和平事业的一个巨大的贡献。
    霍查在讲话中还谴责了现代修正主义。他指出，企图分裂以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结和国际工人运动的团结的帝国主义者和他们的仆从、贝尔格莱德的修正主义者，决不会达到它们的目的。
