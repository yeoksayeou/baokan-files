With the development of production, the cultural life of the workers here has also become greatly active. The reclamation area is vigorously carrying out technical and cultural revolutions. All farms have established primary schools, middle schools, agricultural technical schools, and Red and Expert schools. The Land Reclamation Bureau has also established new types of agricultural universities and animal husbandry universities. The farms have also established kindergartens, post offices, canteens, and department stores. The amateur art troupes, bands, drama troupes, and film projection teams of the farms often perform in the fields. On the banks of the Ussuri River, by Xingkai Lake, and at the foot of the Wanda Mountains, north and south, one can hear beautiful songs praising labor everywhere. (Attached image)
