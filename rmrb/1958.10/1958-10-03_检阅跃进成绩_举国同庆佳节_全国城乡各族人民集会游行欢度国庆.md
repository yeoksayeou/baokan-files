Xinhua News Agency report: People across the country celebrated this year's National Day with even greater joy than in previous years.

When celebrating this year's National Day, people in various places cheered the great victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the brilliant achievements made this year in the Great Leap Forward of "one year equals twenty years."

Sichuan

The 70 million people of Sichuan Province launched a wide variety of celebrations. The parades and gatherings in Chengdu, Yibin, Nanchong and other cities involved 60,000 to 150,000 people. The people in these areas presented gifts to National Day, carrying charts showing the leap-forward development of various undertakings and new combat targets. These charts show that Sichuan's nearly 10 million-strong iron and steel army has built more than 100,000 indigenous blast furnaces, with daily pig iron production exceeding 10,000 tons and daily steel production exceeding 5,000 tons. This year's total grain output can reach more than 85 billion jin, averaging more than 1,000 jin per person.

In Chongqing, one million people braved the rain to participate in National Day parades and gatherings on the 1st. In the 100,000-strong parade in the urban area, the majestic and powerful People's Liberation Army and militia teams marched at the forefront, carrying various new types of weapons, ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and give the American aggressors who dare to touch a hair of our people a head-on blow.

In the workers, farmers, government organs, schools, and residents' contingents, slogans such as "We must recover Jinmen and Mazu" and "We must liberate Taiwan" were shouted continuously, echoing through the clouds. Recently, half of Chongqing's population has been involved in the torrent of fighting for steel. On the eve of National Day, the city's daily steel production has leaped to more than 5,000 tons, a sharp increase of 2.6 times compared with the city's average daily steel production in the first half of September.

Henan

Zhengzhou, Henan Province, held a grand parade of 150,000 people on National Day. 1958 is a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward in Henan Province. Steel production is in a new stage of rapid progress. The province has formed a 5.77 million-strong iron and steel army and built 220,000 various furnaces. In September, the province produced more than 278,800 tons of iron. An unprecedented bumper harvest has also been achieved on the agricultural front. The total grain output in summer and autumn can reach more than 70 billion jin, more than double that of last year.

The vanguard of the parade at the central venue was the PLA stationed in Wuhan, who accepted the review with a firm belief in liberating the motherland's territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

The whole Party and the whole people presented the achievements of large-scale steel production to National Day, which was another feature of the parade on the 1st. The waving red flags and the towering models of indigenous and modern blast furnaces adorned the parade in an extraordinary way, which was a microcosm of the city's large-scale steel production by the whole people. As of the 1st, in less than a month, 400,000 people from all walks of life in Wuhan have joined the movement to seize steel. The city has built more than 3,000 steelmaking furnaces and ironmaking furnaces, and thousands of ironmaking furnaces have officially produced iron, producing a large amount of steel for the country.

In the ranks of the militia in the suburbs of Guangzhou, there were four large trucks towing four anti-aircraft guns, each carrying 42 militiamen gunners neatly standing.

Steelworkers participated in the parade carrying steel ingots and iron blocks they produced. Their indicator signs read: "We will never give up until we complete 130,000 tons of steel this year!" "The torrent of steel is better than the Yangtze River, fiercely fighting back against the American wolf!"

The people who participated in the parade expressed their extreme anger at the US imperialism's instruction to Chiang's air force to attack our air force with missiles. After seeing the statement of the Ministry of National Defense spokesperson, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Army, Air Force, and Artillery troops and the militiamen of the two militia divisions composed of city government cadres wrote thousands of letters of determination, expressing their readiness to strike at the American robbers and Chiang's bandit army at any time.

They are all advanced units and model heroes. In order to defend the motherland, they have fought countless times against the American imperialist dog Chiang's bandit army and made immortal contributions to the people. Recently, the officers and soldiers of the three services were even more angered by the crime of the US imperialism instructing Chiang's bandit army to attack our mainland with missiles supplied by the United States.
