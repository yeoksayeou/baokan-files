Eating without paying,
Have you ever heard of it?
Eating without paying,
Where have you ever seen it?
Never existed in ancient times,
Never existed in the world either.
How could there be such a thing?
Afraid it's just talking in a dream.
Eating without paying,
Who knew it was true!
Right here in our commune,
Vegetables are also free.
You wouldn't believe it if I told you,
But the food has gone into our stomachs.
Thinking of the past,
I can't help but feel bitter.
Life was hard in the past,
Working hard every day,
Never getting enough to eat,
Not even as good as cattle or horses.
Martyrs shed their blood,
Watering the flowers of victory.
Celebrating a bumper harvest of grain,
Establishing a great people's commune.
Production has increased several times over,
We can't finish eating all the grain.
Eating without paying,
A dream about to be realized.
When the news spreads,
The world will be shaken.
The East is all red,
Long live Mao Zedong.

    吃饭不要钱
    徐迟
  吃饭不要钱，
  几曾听说过？
  吃饭不要钱，
  哪里看见过？
  自古所没有，
  世界也从无。
  哪能有这事？
  怕是说梦话。
  吃饭不要钱，
  谁知是真的！
  就在咱公社，
  菜蔬也免费。
  说来不相信，
  饭菜进了肚。
  想起从前事，
  不觉心酸苦。
  从前生活难，
  天天做苦工，
  顿顿吃不饱，
  牛马都不如。
  烈士流鲜血，
  浇出胜利花。
  粮食庆丰收，
  办起大公社。
  生产翻几番，
  粮食吃不完。
  吃饭不要钱，
  梦想要实现。
  消息传出去，
  世界要震动。
  东方一片红，
  万岁毛泽东。
