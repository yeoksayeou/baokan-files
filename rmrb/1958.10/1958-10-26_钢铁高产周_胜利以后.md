    Following the victory of the "Steel High-Yield Week," from October 15th to 21st, a vigorous "Steel Production High-Yield Week" was launched across the country, pushing the mass movement of steel production in our country to a new high. During this week, the average daily steel output increased by 85% compared to the average daily output of the previous fourteen days, and the average daily pig iron output increased by 303% compared to the previous period. The highest daily steel output reached over 100,000 tons, and the highest daily pig iron output reached over 370,000 tons. Surrounding the development of steel production, the national coal production "satellite" continued to operate for ten days, with an average daily coal production of over one million tons. The railway loading "satellite" was also launched for a week, with an average daily loading volume of over 35,000 cars. The high-yield achievements of this week demonstrate that if we can strive for a high-yield record for one day, we can strive for a high-yield record for one week, and we will definitely be able to strive for a high-yield record for a longer period of time.
    Now, we are even more confident in completing the plan to double this year's steel production. Because the launching of "satellites" not only created miracles and inspired people, but more importantly, it enabled us to grasp the laws of high-speed development of production. We have launched high-yield "satellites" for one day and one week, and we have not only achieved a material production harvest for one day and one week, but more importantly, we have learned the experience of controlling material production. This experience is of great significance for our future high-speed development of production and construction.
    What methods should be used to develop socialist construction at high speed? From the heroic feats of steel production and other fronts launching "satellites," we have gained a most valuable experience, which is what Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly taught us: vigorously promote mass movements. This is true in agriculture, and it is also true in industry. After this period of rich practical activities, we have a deeper understanding of mass movements in industry. It is now clear that there are two types of mass movements in industry: small, indigenous, and mass; and large, foreign, and mass. These two types of mass movements are two legs of industry, and neither is dispensable.
    Small, indigenous, and mass is still in the process of trial, popularization, and gradual improvement. Small, indigenous, and mass in iron smelting has been promoted in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Although small, indigenous, and mass in steelmaking has been widely carried out in provinces such as Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Hunan, and Sichuan, some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have only just begun to promote it. Small, indigenous, and mass in other areas such as copper, aluminum, coal, transportation, petroleum, chemical fertilizers, and cement have mostly just begun to be trialed. This leg of industry obviously needs to be strengthened. Therefore, all industries must pay close attention to the experience of steel production's small, indigenous, and mass, which has taken the first step, and prepare to build a small, indigenous, and mass industrial system nationwide that complements large, foreign, and mass.
    From a national perspective, small, indigenous, and mass steel production is now in a process of gradual and planned development from popularization to improvement. For places where small, indigenous, and mass steel production started late and has not yet been popularized, the primary task is of course popularization. However, places where small, indigenous, and mass steel production has already been popularized should pay attention to gradually and systematically developing in the direction of improvement. The so-called gradual and planned development in the direction of improvement means that, on the one hand, professional teams for steel production should be organized, the labor force should be fixed, and technological innovations should be carried out in mining, crushing, smelting, transportation, and coal mining to improve tools, improve technology, and improve equipment in order to save manpower, improve efficiency, improve quality, and reduce costs. On the other hand, good furnace types should be selected, and places with better iron ore and coal mines should be selected to establish iron smelting and steelmaking furnace groups, small, indigenous, and mass coal kilns, and small, indigenous, and mass transportation lines, and gradually develop towards small-scale, indigenous-foreign combined iron and steel joint bases.
    The gradual development of small, indigenous, and mass from popularization to improvement is the inevitable law of the movement of things. Some people think that since small, indigenous, and mass will gradually develop in the direction of improvement, and small ones will become relatively large ones, and indigenous ones will become a combination of indigenous and foreign, why bother to vigorously promote small, indigenous, and mass? They do not understand that without a foundation of popularization, there is no way to talk about improvement. Without using small, indigenous, and mass methods to first produce more steel and train more steelworkers, there is no way to talk about changing small furnaces into slightly larger furnaces, or changing indigenous equipment into indigenous-foreign combined equipment. Without the leg of small, indigenous, and mass, our industry cannot run very fast. Some people also think that since it is small, indigenous, and mass, why bother to spend effort to improve it? They believe that small, indigenous, and mass is just small, indigenous, and mass, that it is necessary to spend more labor, and that the quality must be lower. These comrades regard small, indigenous, and mass as something that is immutable. They do not understand that everything is developing. The gradual development of small, indigenous, and mass from popularization to improvement is completely necessary and completely possible. It is necessary because labor is very tight everywhere, the steel front should improve efficiency and save manpower, and the quality of indigenous iron and indigenous steel needs to be improved, all of which require small, indigenous, and mass to develop in the direction of improvement. It is possible because with the foundation of small, indigenous, and mass popularization, and with more steel and more technical strength, it is not difficult for small, indigenous, and mass to gradually develop in the direction of improvement. If it is both necessary and possible, why not do it?
    The large, foreign, and mass aspect of industry has also begun, but it is not yet deep, thorough, or widespread. Large, foreign, and mass is actually a revolutionary movement in the management of large-scale modern enterprises. We cannot say that there have been no mass movements in our large-scale modern enterprises in the past, but comparatively speaking, this aspect of work is weak. Some cadres of large-scale modern enterprises often only see the power of equipment and the experience in books, and are only accustomed to relying on rules and regulations and relying on orders, and do not see the power of the masses. They are always afraid that when the mass movement rises, it will disrupt the "order" of production. This shackles the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and prevents the full potential of large-scale modern enterprises from being realized. Anshan Iron and Steel and other 18 key enterprises on the steel front paid attention to vigorously promoting mass movements during the "Steel Production High-Yield Week," which increased the average daily steel output by 27.4% compared to the previous fourteen days. This proves that as long as mass movements are vigorously promoted, large-scale modern enterprises can tap great potential. 27.4% is by no means the highest limit. Mastering the magic weapon of vigorously promoting mass movements will surely lead to even greater achievements.
    There are now some good experiences in carrying out mass movements in large-scale modern enterprises. "Two participations (cadres participate in production, workers participate in management), one reform (reform of rules and regulations), three combinations (leading cadres, workers, and technicians), and four bigs (big airing, big blooming, big debate, big-character posters)" have universal significance and should be vigorously promoted.
    The mass movement of steel production and the several "satellites" launched in the past month have greatly changed our country's steel production capacity. Let us redouble our efforts in the last few dozen days to not only ensure the quantity of steel production but also ensure the quality of steel production.

### “钢铁高产周”胜利以后

    “钢铁高产周”胜利以后
    从10月15日到21日，全国各地开展了轰轰烈烈的“钢铁生产高产周”，把我国钢铁生产的群众运动推向了一个新的高潮。在这一周内，钢的平均日产量比以前十四天的平均日产量增加了85％，生铁的平均日产量比以前增加了303％；其中钢的最高日产量曾达到十万多吨，生铁的最高日产量曾达到三十七万多吨。围绕着钢铁生产的发展，全国煤炭生产“卫星”持续运行一旬，平均日采煤炭一百多万吨，铁路装车“卫星”也连放一周，平均每日装车数达三万五千多车。这一周的高产成就表明：我们能争得一天的高产纪录，就能争得一周的高产纪录，也一定能争得更久更长时间的高产纪录。
    现在来看完成今年钢产加番的计划，就更有把握了。因为“卫星”的放射，不只是创造了奇迹，鼓舞了人心；更重要的还在于它使我们掌握了高速度发展生产的规律。我们放出了一天、一周的高产“卫星”，不只是得到一天、一周物质生产上的丰收；更重要的还在于学到了驾驭物质生产的经验，这些经验对于我们今后进一步高速度地发展生产建设有着重大的意义。
    用什么方法去高速度地发展社会主义建设事业？从钢铁战线和其他战线竞放“卫星”的壮举中，我们得到一条最宝贵的经验，这就是毛泽东同志曾反复教导我们的：大搞群众运动。农业上是如此，工业上也是如此。经过这一段时期丰富的实践活动，对于工业方面的群众运动，我们已经有更深的体会了。现在可以看得很清楚，工业方面的群众运动有两种，一种是小、土、群，一种是大、洋、群。这两种群众运动是工业方面的两条腿，缺一不可。
    小、土、群，现在还是一个试办、普及和逐步提高的过程。炼铁方面的小、土、群，已在全国各省、市、自治区推行；炼钢方面的小、土、群，虽然在河南、山西、山东、湖南、四川等省已经普遍开展，但也有一些省、市、自治区才着手推行。其他铜、铝、煤、运输、石油、化肥、水泥等方面的小、土、群，大都才开始试办。工业方面的这一条腿显然还有待于加强。因此，各行各业都要十分注意先行一步的钢铁生产的小、土、群的经验，准备在全国范围内建设起一个同大、洋、群相辅而行的小、土、群的工业体系。
    钢铁生产的小、土、群，从全国范围来看，现在处于一个逐步有计划地由普及向提高发展的过程。对于钢铁生产的小、土、群动手较晚、现在还没有普及的地方，首要任务当然是普及；但钢铁生产的小、土、群已经普及了的地方，则应该注意逐步有计划地向提高的方向发展。所谓逐步有计划地向提高的方向发展，就是说，一方面组织钢铁生产的专业队伍，把劳动力固定下来，在采矿、碎矿、冶炼、运输、采煤等方面开展技术革新，改进工具，改进技术，改进设备，以便节省人力，提高效率，提高质量，降低成本；另一方面选择好的炉型，选择有较好的铁矿和煤矿的地方，建立炼铁和炼钢的炉群，小、土、群的煤窑，小、土、群的运输线，逐步向小型的土洋结合的钢铁联合基地发展。
    小、土、群逐步由普及向提高发展，是事物运动的必然规律。有人以为既然小、土、群要逐步向提高的方向发展，小的要变成比较大的，土的要变成土洋结合的，又何必大搞小、土、群呢？他们不了解，没有普及的基础就无从谈到提高，不用小、土、群的办法先炼出更多的钢铁、培养更多的钢铁工人，就根本谈不到把小的炉子改成稍大一点的炉子，把土的设备改成土洋结合的设备。没有小、土、群这一条腿，我们的工业是不可能跑得很快的。还有些人以为，既然是小、土、群，又何必再费心血去提高呢？他们认为小、土、群就是小、土、群，就是要多费劳动力，质量就是要低些。这些同志把小、土、群看成是一成不变的东西。他们不了解任何事情都是发展的。小、土、群逐步由普及向提高发展，完全必要，也完全可能。所以说是必要，因为各地劳动力都很紧张，钢铁战线应该提高效率，节省人力，土铁土钢的质量尤需提高，这些都需要小、土、群朝提高的方向发展；所以说是可能，因为有了小、土、群普及的基础，有了比较多的钢铁，比较多的技术力量，小、土、群逐步朝提高的方向发展并不困难。既需要又可能，何乐而不为？
    工业方面的大、洋、群也已经开始，但目前还不深、不透、不普遍。大、洋、群实际上是大型现代化企业管理上的一次革命运动。我们的大型现代化企业，不能说过去都没有过群众运动，但比较起来，这方面的工作是薄弱的。一些大型现代化企业的干部常常只看到设备的力量、书本上的经验，只习惯于靠规章制度、靠命令办事，而看不到群众的力量，总害怕群众运动起来了，会打乱生产的“秩序”。这就束缚了群众的积极性和创造性，不能充分发挥大型现代化企业的潜力。鞍钢等十八个钢铁战线上的重点企业，在“钢铁生产高产周”中，注意了大搞群众运动，使钢的平均日产量比以前十四天提高了27.4％。这就证明了只要大搞群众运动，大型的现代化企业可以挖掘出很大的潜力来。27.4％决不是最高的限度，掌握了大搞群众运动这个法宝，一定能有更高的成就。
    在大型现代化企业搞群众运动，现在也已有了一些好的经验。“两参（干部参加生产、工人参加管理）、一改（改革规章制度）、三结合（领导干部、工人和技术人员）、四大（大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报）”是有普遍意义的，应该大力推行。
    一个多月来钢铁生产的群众运动和几番“卫星”上天，已经使我国钢铁生产的能力大为改观。让我们在最后几十天的时间里加倍努力，不仅保证钢铁生产的数量，而且保证钢铁生产的质量。
