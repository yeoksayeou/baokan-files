Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. Chinese People's Volunteer Army headquarters officers and soldiers, led by General Yang Yong, Commander of the Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, boarded the "China-Korea Friendship" train at 7:00 PM today to return home triumphantly, accompanied by Li Il-kyong, Minister of Education and Culture of the Korean Cabinet, and General Li Kwon-mu, Chief of Staff of the Korean People's Army.

At 9:15 AM today, over ten thousand Korean people held a grand farewell meeting at the Volunteer Army headquarters' station. Zhang Yun-pil, Vice Chairman of the local People's Committee, delivered a farewell speech. After outlining the great significance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's resistance against America and aid to Korea, as well as its voluntary withdrawal from Korea, he said: Your great contributions to the cause of peace and the enormous assistance given to the Korean people will forever remain in the hearts of all Korean people. Zhang Yun-pil sternly condemned the American aggressors for creating tension in the Taiwan Strait. He said: The American aggressors should immediately stop their brutal interference in China's internal affairs and should immediately get out of South Korea and Taiwan. The Korean people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle for territorial integrity and the maintenance of their sovereignty, and are confident that the Chinese people will surely win.

After Zhang Yun-pil's speech, the Party and government organs and overseas Chinese in the Volunteer Army headquarters' station presented silk banners and gifts to the Volunteer Army headquarters. The people of a certain county presented the Volunteer Army headquarters with a silk banner embroidered by 3,112 women from seventeen villages, working day and night. The banner was embroidered with twenty-nine large characters: "The heroic feats of the commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army will shine forever in our history."

General Xiao Yingtang, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Volunteer Army, delivered a reply. He said earnestly, "Dear elders, brothers, and sisters! Although we are about to leave, our hearts will forever be linked with yours. Our struggles in both China and Korea are still centered around a common goal—peace and socialism. Your struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland will always receive our full support. May you achieve new successes in the struggle to develop the Korean economy and peacefully reunify the motherland."

After the meeting, headquarters officers and soldiers and the farewell crowd held a get-together, exchanging souvenirs.

At 10:30 AM, General Yang Yong, General Wang Ping, and others led headquarters officers and soldiers through the ten-mile-long farewell procession, then switched to cars to proceed to the boarding station. Wherever the motorcade passed, Korean people from all over the country, working in the fields and along the roadsides, stopped their work and waved their hands and hats to cheer the returning heroes, wishing them a safe journey. More than 1,200 local soldiers and civilians and actors from a certain provincial art theater, who were waiting at the station square to bid farewell to the Volunteer Army as they boarded the train, also held a get-together and farewell performance with the Volunteer Army heroes after the motorcade entered the square.

    离别英雄的土地　重返亲爱的祖国
    志愿军总部官兵走上归途
    据新华社平壤22日电　中国人民志愿军总部官兵在志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将等率领下，今天下午七时在朝鲜内阁教育文化相李一卿、人民军总参谋长李权武上将陪同下，登上“朝中友谊”号列车凯旋归国。
    今天上午九时十五分，一万多朝鲜人民在志愿军总部驻地举行隆重的欢送大会。当地人民委员会副委员长张允弼致欢送词。他概述了中国人民志愿军抗美援朝以及主动撤离朝鲜的重大意义后说：你们对于和平事业的重大贡献和给予朝鲜人民的巨大援助，将永远留在全体朝鲜人民的心上。张允弼严厉谴责美国侵略者在台湾海峡制造紧张局势。他说：美国侵略者应立即停止对中国内政的横暴干涉，应立即从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去。朝鲜人民全力支持中国人民为国土完整和维护自己主权而进行的正义斗争，并确信中国人民一定获得胜利。
    张允弼讲话后，志愿军总部驻地的党政机关和华侨向志愿军总部赠送了锦旗和礼品。某郡人民把十七个里三千一百一十二名妇女日夜赶绣的一面锦旗赠给志愿军总部。旗上绣着“英雄的中国人民志愿军指战员的伟大功勋将在我国历史上永放光芒”二十九个大字。
    志愿军副参谋长萧应棠将军致答谢词。他语重情深地说，亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们！虽然我们就要离别了，但我们的心将永远同你们连在一起。我们在中国和朝鲜两地进行的斗争，仍然是围着一个共同的目标——和平和社会主义。你们和平统一祖国的斗争，将永远得到我们的全力支持。愿你们在发展朝鲜经济、和平统一祖国的斗争中，取得新的成就。
    大会结束后，总部官兵和欢送的人群进行了联欢，互相赠送了纪念品。
    十时三十分，杨勇上将、王平上将等率领总部官兵穿过十里长的欢送行列，然后改乘汽车向登车站前进。车队过处，正在田野里和公路边劳动的各地朝鲜人民，都停止了作业，向归国的英雄们举手挥帽欢呼，祝英雄们一路平安。等候在车站广场上欢送志愿军登车的一千二百多当地军民和某道艺术剧场的演员们，在车队进入广场后，还和志愿军英雄们进行了联欢和送别演出。（附图片）
