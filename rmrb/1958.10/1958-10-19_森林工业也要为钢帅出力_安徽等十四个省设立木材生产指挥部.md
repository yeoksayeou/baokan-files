The nation's forestry workers are determined to contribute to the steel commander and coal production, and are actively striving to overfulfill this year's timber production tasks. From January to early October this year, national timber production completed nearly 71.64% of the annual plan. Eleven forestry bureaus, including Yitulihe, Tulihe, and Ganhe in Inner Mongolia, and Jianghua and Qiyang in Hunan, and Ninghua in Fujian, have respectively completed their annual timber production plans ahead of schedule in July and September. Jianghua in Hunan is striving to double next year's timber production task next month.

Due to the massive increase in steel and coal production, the supply of pit props has become a prominent issue. In response to this problem, various localities have made new deployments for timber production. Currently, fourteen provinces, including Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, have established timber production headquarters, with vice governors or heads of provincial rural work departments personally taking charge of timber production. The Anhui Provincial Party Committee recently specifically studied the labor issues in timber production and decided that each special district and county should complete the annual timber production tasks within this month. It demanded the adoption of methods used during wartime to support the front lines, drawing 80,000 laborers from non-forestry areas to organize more than 330 specialized timber production teams, totaling over 100,000 people, to make a concentrated effort in timber production. Wuhu Special District in the province mobilized 70,000 to 80,000 people for a 30-day hard battle and has completed the annual felling task. Guangxi Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County mobilized an army of 150,000 people, and from October 1st to 8th, after eight days and nights of combat, felled 400,000 cubic meters of timber, equivalent to the total timber production task of the past four years, and also cut 1.3 million bamboo poles, equivalent to the total bamboo production task of the past six years. Over 30,000 women in the county participated in timber production for the first time ever. The Secretary of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture Committee in Guizhou Province personally took command, grasped timber production, organized an army of 50,000 people to go up the mountains, implemented militarized organization at the county level, established regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons, and set a deadline of before October 15th to complete this year's timber production tasks.

In order to increase the production of large quantities of timber, various localities have also grasped the small-area timber felling in areas with scattered forest resources in accordance with the principle of "many points and wide coverage." The people's communes in many places implemented the four-responsibility system: responsibility for quantity, responsibility for quality, responsibility for time, and responsibility for delivery location. Fujian Province launched people-run logging yards, and the counties in Longyan Special District alone established 179 logging yards.

In order to make a concentrated effort to increase timber production, the southern provinces are taking vigorous measures to promote technical innovations in felling, gathering, and transportation operations, such as widely promoting curved saws, bamboo chips, bamboo cableways, building wooden railways, and improving waterways, striving to break through the three barriers of felling, gathering, and transportation. The Taishijing Forestry Bureau in Anhui has built a "five-ization" rapid gathering and transportation network (mountain steep slope slide trackization, aerial ropewayization, land transportation vehicleization, loading and unloading mechanization - wooden cranes, water transport herding floatingization); Hunan Province relied on the local Party committee to mobilize the masses to run their own tool factories and cement factories, solving the difficulties in the supply of materials and equipment. The Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas are vigorously building aerial ropeways and making full use of all new tools. Some areas have implemented a two-shift or three-shift production system.

    森林工业也要为钢帅出力
    安徽等十四个省设立木材生产指挥部
    本报讯　全国林业职工决心为钢帅、煤炭出力，正积极为超额完成今年木材生产任务而奋斗。今年1月至10月上旬全国木材生产完成全年计划近71.64％，内蒙古伊图里河、图里河、甘河、湖南江华、祁阳、福建宁化等十一个林业局已分别于7、9月提前完成了全年木材生产计划，湖南江华正争取下月完成明年木材生产翻一番的任务。
    由于钢铁煤炭的大增产，整个坑木供应成为当前突出的问题。针对这个问题，各地对木材生产都作了新的部署。现在全国已有湖南、贵州、江西、浙江、安徽等十四个省成立木材生产指挥部，由副省长或省委农村工作部长亲自抓木材生产。安徽省委最近专门研究木材生产中的劳力问题，并决定各专县在本月内突击完成全年木材生产任务。要求采用战争期间支援前线的办法，从非林产区抽调八万劳力组织三百三十多个木材生产专业队总共十余万人突击木材生产。该省芜湖专区发动七八万人苦战三十天，已完成全年采伐任务。广西大苗山苗族自治县动员十五万大军，从10月1日到8日经过八昼夜的战斗，砍伐木材四十万立方公尺，相当于过去四年木材生产任务的总和，同时砍竹子一百三十万根，相当于过去六年竹子生产任务的总和。全县有三万多妇女破天荒第一次参加木材生产。贵州省黔东南苗族、侗族自治州州委书记亲自挂帅，掌握木材生产，组织了五万大军上山，以县为单位，实行军事化组织，成立团、营、连、排，限期10月15日以前完成今年木材生产任务。
    为增产大量木材，各地还根据“点多面广”的方针，抓紧了森林资源分散地区的小面积木材采伐。许多地方的人民公社实行的四包制：包数量、包质量、包时间、包交货地点。福建省发动民办伐木场，仅龙岩专区各县建立的伐木场就有一百七十九个。
    为了突击增产木材，南方各省正采取大力推广弯把锯、竹片、篾缆索道，搞木轨道，改进河道等采运作业中的技术革新措施，力争突破采伐、集材、运输三关。安徽太石旌林业局的采伐已建成一个“五化”快速集材运输网（高山陡坡滑道化、空中索道化、陆运车子化、装卸机械化——木制起重机、水运赶羊流送化）；湖南省依靠当地党委发动群众，自办工具厂、水泥厂，解决了物资器材供应的困难。东北、内蒙古林区大搞架空索道，把所有的新工具，都充分利用起来，有些地区已实行双班制或三班制生产。（附图片）
