Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, October 29th: Lebanese Prime Minister and Minister of Information, Karami, said at a press conference today that, with the withdrawal of U.S. troops, stability has returned to Lebanon, and "UN observers no longer have any reason to remain here."

He said, "The government will soon ask Hammarskjöld to withdraw the observers."

Karami pointed out that the "accusations" made by the Chamoun regime against the United Arab Republic cannot be a reason to keep UN observers in Lebanon. He said that a committee of legal experts has been formed "to study all the legal procedures and measures that will enable us to end these accusations."

Someone asked whether the Lebanese government was seeking foreign financial assistance. Karami said that the U.S. ambassador had visited him and indicated that the U.S. government was willing to provide loans to Lebanon. He said, "The government will first study its financial revenues and expenditures, and then request assistance according to our needs."

A reporter asked him what he thought about seeking Soviet assistance. Karami said, "They have previously shown kindness and goodwill." Here he was referring to Soviet aid to the United Arab Republic.

    卡拉米说黎巴嫩已恢复稳定
    将要求联合国观察员撤退
    据新华社贝鲁特29日电　黎巴嫩总理兼宣传部长卡拉米今天在记者招待会上说，由于美军撤退，黎巴嫩的稳定已经恢复，“联合国观察员不再有任何理由留在这里”。
    他说，“政府不久将要求哈马舍尔德撤退观察员。”
    卡拉米指出，夏蒙政权对阿拉伯联合共和国提出的“控诉”，不能成为在黎巴嫩保留联合国观察员的理由。他说，法律专家委员会已经组成，“研究使我们结束这种控诉的一切法律手续和措施”。
    有人问，黎巴嫩政府是否正在寻求外国的财政援助。卡拉米说，美国大使访问了他，并且表示美国政府愿意向黎巴嫩提供贷款。他说：“政府将首先研究财政收支，然后根据我们的需要来要求帮助。”
    有记者问他，对谋求苏联援助有什么想法。卡拉米说：“他们先前已经表现出仁厚和好意。”他在这里指的是苏联对阿拉伯联合共和国的援助。
