Xinhua News Agency, October 26th dispatch from Washington: The U.S. government is stepping up its efforts to expand military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities in order to further exacerbate tensions in the Taiwan Strait region and continue to interfere in China's internal affairs.

According to a report by United Press reporter Haytowar on the 25th, "U.S. officials are now discussing the issue of shipping more modern weapons to Nationalist China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) as a means of strengthening the anti-communist forces in the Formosa Strait (referring to the Taiwan Strait)." Haytowar said, "The result of the discussion may be an expansion of the military aid program to the Nationalists (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities)," and "Some authorities estimate that the cost of doing so may range from hundreds of millions of dollars to more than one billion dollars."

Haytowar pointed out that since August of this year, the U.S. government has spent approximately 300 million U.S. dollars, equivalent to one-fifth of the U.S.'s foreign military aid appropriation for this year, in order to continuously transport military supplies, artillery, and other supplies to Jinmen. Haytowar said that in order to expand aid to Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. government, with its limited aid funds, may have to propose to Congress next year to increase appropriations.

Haytowar admitted that the U.S.'s planned increase in military aid to Chiang Kai-shek is also related to the U.S. government's insistence on forcing Chiang Kai-shek to accept its scheme to create "two Chinas." The United States is attempting to use the bait of "providing newer American weapons" to induce Chiang Kai-shek to reduce the number of troops stationed on China's coastal islands.

    硬要继续干涉我国内政
    美策划给蒋介石更多军火
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在加紧策划扩大对蒋介石当局的军事援助，以进一步加剧台湾海峡地区的紧张局势和继续干涉中国内政。
    据美联社记者海托华25日报道说，“美国官员们现在正在讨论向国民党中国（指蒋介石集团）运送更新式的武器，以作为加强在福摩萨海峡（指台湾海峡）的反共部队的力量的手段的问题。”海托华说，“讨论的结果可能是扩大对国民党人（指蒋介石当局）的军事援助计划”，“有些权威人士估计，这样做所需要的费用可能从几亿美元一直到十亿多美元”。
    海托华指出，自从今年8月以来，美国政府为了不断向金门输送军火、大炮和其他补给品已经用了大约三亿美元，等于美国今年的对外军事援助拨款的五分之一。海托华说，为了扩大对蒋介石的援助，援助基金有限的美国政府明年可能要向国会提出增拨经费的问题。
    海托华承认，美国计划中的增加对蒋介石的军事援助也同美国政府硬要蒋介石接受它的制造“两个中国”的阴谋一事有关。美国企图以“提供更新的美国武器”为诱饵来使蒋介石削减驻在中国沿海岛屿的军队。
