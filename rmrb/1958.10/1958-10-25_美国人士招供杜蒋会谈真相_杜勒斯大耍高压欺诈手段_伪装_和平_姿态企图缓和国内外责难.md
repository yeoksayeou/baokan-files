    Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: According to Western news agencies, American sources are shamelessly gloating over the pressure and deceptive tactics employed by Dulles during the U.S.-Chiang talks.

    American sources are boasting that Dulles "achieved victory." Representative Zablocki, Chairman of the Far East Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters on the 23rd after hearing a briefing from government officials regarding the Taipei talks that he believed "Dulles won" in the talks. United Press International sent a message from Washington reflecting the U.S. authorities' attitude of utmost insult toward the Chiang Kai-shek clique, stating that the Eisenhower administration had retracted the practice of "letting the Chiang Kai-shek clique out of the cage," and that Dulles asked Chiang Kai-shek to "guarantee not to use force to attack the mainland" in the joint communique, thereby making "Chiang Kai-shek openly and formally re-tie himself." When talking about this, Roberts, a news analyst for the Associated Press, also said, "In reality, Chiang Kai-shek has always been controlled by the noose that Americans put around his neck."

    According to American news agencies, Dulles spared no effort in forcing Chiang Kai-shek to issue a "no use of force" statement during this meeting because of America's own needs. The United States' brinkmanship policy in the Taiwan Strait is facing widespread criticism at home and abroad. The news said that the American Republican government "due to domestic election needs," and "due to pressure from allied countries who have raised criticisms," therefore needs to make some gesture.

    At the same time, according to United Press International, senior Washington officials stated that they can still "freely use force" to attack the mainland when "rebellion" occurs on the Chinese mainland. United Press International said that the U.S. State Department will "consider" this "definition of rebellion" and the "correct timing to release Chiang Kai-shek's 500,000 troops."

    Agence France-Presse reported that Dulles "wrestled (the guarantee of renouncing the use of force) from Chiang Kai-shek," causing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to "helplessly accept the concept of two Chinas."

    Some Western news agency reports also stated that Dulles made "concessions" to Chiang Kai-shek during this meeting, as manifested in the U.S. mentioning in the joint communique that "under the present circumstances, the defense of Quemoy together with Matsu is closely related to the defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores." However, according to United Press International, Washington diplomatic officials pointed out that "by limiting this relationship to 'the present circumstances,' the communique allows Eisenhower and Dulles the freedom to separate these two issues," and "it is believed that the wording of the communique gives the United States an escape route in this regard."

    United Press International's Washington correspondent Potts reported that after Chiang Kai-shek made guarantees according to the demands of the United States, "what did he get in return? The communique does not show any new or revised aspects of U.S. policy."

    An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Taipei said that Dulles' visit created "resentment" in Taipei. Agence France-Presse's Taipei dispatch said that the United States forced the Chiang Kai-shek clique to make concessions in this meeting, and "Chiang Kai-shek and his assistants repeatedly expressed anger about the loss of face caused by making these concessions." Western diplomats in Taipei believe that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "reluctantly agreed to make concessions," and "these concessions will widen the rift between Nationalist China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek clique) and the United States."

    美国人士招供杜蒋会谈真相
    杜勒斯大耍高压欺诈手段
    伪装“和平”姿态企图缓和国内外责难
    新华社24日讯　据西方通讯社报道，美国人士正在不知羞耻地对杜勒斯在美蒋会谈中所采取的压力和欺诈手段津津乐道。
    美国人士吹嘘杜勒斯“取得了胜利”。美国众议院外交委员会远东小组委员会主席扎布洛基，23日在听取政府官员关于台北会谈的汇报后，对记者说，他认为在会谈里
  “是杜勒斯赢了”。合众国际社从华盛顿发出了一条反映美国当局对蒋介石集团的极尽侮辱之能事的态度的消息说，艾森豪威尔政府已经收回了把蒋介石集团“放出笼”的做法，杜勒斯要蒋介石在会谈公报中“保证不使用武力进攻大陆”，这样来使得“蒋介石已经公开地和正式地把自己重新束缚了起来”。美联社新闻分析员罗伯茨在谈到这一点时还说，“实在的讲，蒋介石一向都被美国人所套的颈圈控制着”。
    据美国通讯社说，杜勒斯所以在这次会谈里竭力迫使蒋介石发表
  “不使用武力”的声明，是出于美国自己的需要。美国在台湾海峡地区的战争边缘政策正在国内外遭到广泛的责难。消息说，美国共和党政府“由于国内选举的需要”，由于“受到提出批评的盟国的压力”，因而需要作出某种姿态。
    同时，据合众国际社报道，华盛顿高级官员表示，在中国大陆上发生“叛乱”时，仍然可以“自由使用武力”来向大陆进攻。合众国际社说，这种“叛乱的定义”和把蒋介石“五十万军队放出来的正确时机”，将由美国国务院“考虑”。
    法新社消息说，杜勒斯从“蒋介石那里硬争到了（放弃使用武力）的保证”，而使得蒋介石集团“无可奈何地接受了两个中国的概念”。
    西方通讯社有些报道里也说，杜勒斯在这次会谈里对蒋介石作出了“让步”，表现在美国在会谈公报里谈到“在目前情况下，金门连同马祖的防务，是同台湾和澎湖的防务密切相关的”。然而，据合众国际社报道，华盛顿外交官员指出，“由于把这种关系限于‘目前情况’，公报使艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯可以自由地把这两个问题分开”、“人们认为，公报的措词使美国在这方面有一个逃路”。
    合众国际社驻华盛顿记者波茨的报道里说，蒋介石根据美国的要求作了保证以后“换得了什么呢？公报中看不出美国政策有什么新的或者修正之处”。
    法新社从台北发出的一条消息说，杜勒斯此行在台北造成了“怨恨情绪”。法新社台北消息说，美国在这次会谈中迫使蒋介石集团作出让步，“蒋介石和他的助手们曾经再三对作出这些让步使他们丢面子的情况，表示气愤”。在台北的西方外交人士认为，蒋介石集团“勉强答应让步”，而“这些让步却会扩大国民党中国（即蒋介石集团）和美国之间的裂痕”。
