Xinhua News Agency, 30th — Chairman Mao Zedong recently inspected several provinces in the Yangtze River Basin. From September 10th to 15th, Chairman Mao was in Wuhan, watching the first iron smelting of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation; meeting with the worker masses; watching the small blast furnace iron smelting of the No. 1 Cotton Mill; watching the many small chemical factories run by the teachers and students of the Chemistry Department of Wuhan University and meeting with the teachers and students; watched the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory and met with the workers; and met with cadres from all walks of life in Wuhan. On the 15th, Chairman Mao traveled from Wuchang via Echeng and Daye to Huangshigang, along the way viewing the abundant agriculture, the Daye Iron Mine, and the Huangshigang Special Steel Plant, and meeting with the worker masses. On the morning of the 16th, Chairman Mao arrived in Anqing, watching a small blast furnace at a middle school in Anqing; watching the small blast furnace clusters run by the government offices, and met with the people of Anqing. On the same day, Chairman Mao arrived in Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, passing through the three counties of Tongcheng, Shucheng, and Feixi, viewing the abundant agriculture and visiting a people's commune. On the highway, Chairman Mao saw the vast streams of people traveling tens or hundreds of kilometers to counties where iron ore could be found for mining and smelting. Chairman Mao visited Hefei for the first time. Here, Chairman Mao watched two medium-sized steel plants; watched an agricultural implements exhibition; and visited an exhibition hall of industrial and agricultural products and inventions. Chairman Mao met with cadres and the broad masses of people in Hefei; in Wuhu, he visited factories and met with cadres. On the 20th, Chairman Mao arrived at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant and met with workers and citizens. Chairman Mao arrived in Nanjing on the 20th, met with cadres, and then went to Shanghai, met with cadres, and visited a steel plant. Chairman Mao returned to Beijing on September 29th.

Chairman Mao told reporters from this agency: This trip showed me the great enthusiasm of the people, and on this basis, all tasks can be accomplished. The task on the steel front should be completed first. On the steel front, the broad masses have already been mobilized. But as far as the whole country is concerned, in some places and in some enterprises, the work of mobilizing the masses has not been done well. Mass meetings have not been held, the tasks, reasons, and methods have not been explained clearly to the masses, and debates have not been launched among the masses. To this day, some of our comrades are still unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in industry. They describe engaging in mass movements on the industrial front as "irregular," denigrating it as "rural style" and "guerrilla habits." This is obviously wrong. Chairman Mao told reporters: While working hard on steel, don't lose sight of agriculture. The people's communes must plant wheat and rapeseed well, and plow the land deeply. The agricultural tasks for 1959 should have a greater leap forward than in 1958. For this reason, the labor force in industry and agriculture should be well organized, and people's communes should be universally promoted. Chairman Mao said: The organization of militia divisions is very good and should be promoted. This is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization. Chairman Mao said: The imperialists are bullying us so much that we need to deal with them seriously. We must not only have a strong regular army, but also run militia divisions on a large scale. In this way, when imperialism invades our country, it will make it impossible for them to move an inch. Chairman Mao said: The life of the imperialists will not be long, because they are doing evil, specializing in supporting anti-people reactionaries in various countries, occupying a large number of colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases, and threatening peace with atomic war. In this way, they are forcing more than 90% of the people in the world to rise up against them. But the imperialists are still alive, and they are still rampant in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are still oppressing the people of their own countries in the Western world. Chairman Mao said: This situation must change. Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly US imperialism, is the task of the people of the world.

General Zhang Zhizhong traveled with Chairman Mao on this trip. He is a people's representative and vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission. He is from Anhui. He is interested in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. He is very concerned about those people in Taiwan who had connections with him in the past, and hopes that they will recognize the ferocity of US imperialism and take the path of patriotism.

    毛主席巡视大江南北
    回京后对记者发表重要谈话
    人民群众干劲很大，在这个基础上各项任务都是可以完成的。——首先应完成钢铁战线的任务。工业方面要搞大规模群众运动。——明年农业应有一个更大的跃进，应把工业和农业方面的劳动力好好组织起来。——我们不但要有强大的正规军，还要大办民兵师。——帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了。结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。
    新华社30日讯　毛泽东主席最近巡视了长江流域的几个省。毛主席9月10日至15日在武汉，看了武汉钢铁公司第一炉出铁；会见了工人群众；看了第一纱厂的小高炉出铁；看了武汉大学化学系师生们办的许多小型化学工厂，同武汉大学师生见了面；看了武汉重型机床厂，同工人见了面；在武汉同各方面的干部见了面。15日，毛主席由武昌经鄂城、大冶到了黄石港，沿途看了丰盛的农业、大冶铁山、黄石港特殊钢厂，同工人群众见了面。16日上午，毛主席到安庆，看了安庆一个中学的小高炉；看了由机关办的小高炉群，会见了安庆人民群众。当天毛主席到了安徽省会合肥城，沿途经过桐城、舒城、肥西三县，看了丰盛的农业，看了一个人民公社。在汽车道上，毛主席看见了要走几十公里或者几百公里路到有铁矿石可找的县份去挖矿、炼铁的广大的人流。毛主席第一次访问了合肥城。在这里，毛主席看了两个中型钢铁厂；看了农具展览场；又看了工业农业产品和发明的展览馆。毛主席在合肥会见了干部和广大的人民群众；在芜湖，看了工厂，会见了干部。20日毛主席到了马鞍山钢铁厂，会见了工人和市民群众。毛主席20日到南京，跟干部们见了面，然后到上海，会见了干部，看了一个钢铁厂。毛主席已经在9月29日回到北京。
    毛主席对本社记者说：此次旅行，看到了人民群众很大的干劲，在这个基础上各项任务都是可以完成的。首先应当完成钢铁战线上的任务。在钢铁战线上，广大群众已经发动起来了。但是就全国来说，有一些地方，有一些企业，对于发动群众的工作还没有做好，没有开群众大会，没有将任务、理由和方法，向群众讲得清清楚楚，并在群众中展开辩论。到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是“不正规”，贬之为“农村作风”、“游击习气”。这显然是不对的。毛主席对记者说：在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉了。人民公社一定要把小麦种好，把油菜种好，把土地深翻好。1959年农业方面的任务，应当比1958年有一个更大的跃进。为此，应当把工业方面和农业方面的劳动力好好组织起来，人民公社应当普遍推广。毛主席说：民兵师的组织很好，应当推广。这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。毛主席说：帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。毛主席说：帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界90％以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。但是帝国主义者目前还是在活着，他们依然在向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道。他们在西方世界也依然在压迫他们本国的人民群众。毛主席说：这种局面必需改变。结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。
    此次同毛主席一起旅行的，有张治中将军。他是人民代表和国防委员会副主席。他是安徽人。他对工业、农业大跃进感到兴趣。他很关心在台湾的那些过去和他有联系的人们，希望他们认识美帝国主义的凶恶，走到爱国主义的道路上来。（附图片）
