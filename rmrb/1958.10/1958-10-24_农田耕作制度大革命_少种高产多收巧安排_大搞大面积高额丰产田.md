Hebei Anguo County: Large High-Yield Areas Achieve Garden-Style Cultivation
Shanxi Changzhi Region: Concentrate Efforts on Intensive Cultivation of "Basic Farmland"
Shaanxi Chang'an County: Plan to Implement the "Three-Thirds System" for Agricultural Production
Shandong Shan County: Transform 600,000 Mu of Early-Season Wheat into High-Yield Fields

According to Hebei Daily News: Anguo County, based on this year's bumper harvest, boldly carried out a revolution in wheat cultivation systems. On nearly half of the county's wheat fields, large-scale high-yield areas were developed, with smaller high-yield demonstration fields nested within these large areas. The harvest from these high-yield areas alone can guarantee a yield of 5,000 jin per mu across the county's 400,000 mu of wheat fields.

To achieve this leap forward target, the Anguo County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) put forward the requirements of standardized sowing, regionalized planting, garden-style cultivation, and improved varieties, and formulated specific operating procedures, specifying strict standards and quality for deep plowing, fertilization, irrigation, sowing, and harrowing.

To ensure the standardized quality of wheat planting, cadres and members of the communes throughout the county were highly motivated and full of energy. Their slogans were: "Half a woman counts as a whole, women count as men, one counts as ten, a hundred counts as a thousand, determined to plant wheat well and guarantee 5,000 jin next year." In addition to promoting "ten things to the field," the communes generally adopted measures such as reducing the number of nursery staff, administrators, salespeople, and feeders, and having government agencies and schools go to the battlefield. In this way, more than 250,000 laborers in the county participated in plowing and planting wheat. Cadres and the masses established more than 200 headquarters and more than 11,000 battle sheds in the field, organizing all the labor force into specialized teams and groups for plowing, fertilizer delivery, irrigation, and sowing, launching a day and night battle with military-style actions. By October 19th, 380,000 mu of land that should have been deep-plowed this year had been plowed, with a depth of more than 1.2 chi. More than 200,000 mu reached more than 1.5 chi. General wheat fields were fertilized with more than 30,000 to 50,000 jin per mu; 180,000 mu of large high-yield areas were fertilized with 80,000 to 100,000 jin per mu; and 80,000 mu of satellite fields were fertilized with 220,000 jin per mu. The wheat fields in the county have all been transformed into ridge fields, and the land has been harrowed like old farmers planting vegetable gardens, truly achieving "land as flat as a mirror, ridges as straight as a line."

When formulating next year's wheat production increase plan, the Anguo County Committee of the CPC first analyzed the situation of the county's great leap forward in agriculture. This year, the average yield of grain in the county can reach 3,600 jin per mu (the average summer yield was 491 jin per mu), an increase of more than six times compared with last year. Based on these facts, the county committee believes that it is entirely possible to achieve a wheat yield of 5,000 jin per mu next year under the condition of realizing the people's commune system.

After the county committee put forward this ambitious plan, the people's communes first adopted the revolutionary measure of developing large-scale high-yield fields. After planning, the county divided twenty-two large high-yield wheat areas. The Dongfeng People's Commune further nested small high-yield demonstration fields within the large high-yield areas. The commune plans to plant 95,000 mu of wheat. In addition to planning three high-yield areas (a total of more than 60,000 mu), it also designated 1,000 mu of satellite fields in the high-yield area of ​​Wurenqiao Village, striving to achieve an average yield of 20,000 jin per mu. This method of large areas enclosing small areas, with small areas driving large areas, is a revolution in wheat planting. It broke the original decentralized planting method of small cooperatives, first realized regionalized planting, achieved adapting to local conditions, and at the same time, it was convenient to concentrate manpower, material resources, and technical forces to achieve garden-style cultivation. After discovering this creation of the Dongfeng People's Commune, the Anguo County Committee of the CPC immediately promoted it. Therefore, while developing large-scale high-yield fields, various names such as "10,000-mu satellite fields" appeared successively in more than 80,000 mu of high-yield "satellite" fields.

This newspaper reported that the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the CPC in Shanxi Province recently convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the county and city committees to formulate a plan for next year's great leap forward in agriculture. It was decided to continue to implement the "basic farmland" system, further abandon 600,000 mu of barren mountain slopes, and concentrate efforts on intensive cultivation of "basic farmland" to strive for large-scale high yields next year.

Since last winter, the Changzhi region has implemented the "basic farmland" system, planned to abandon some cultivated land, and implemented intensive cultivation on the "basic farmland," achieving unprecedented harvests. This year, the total output is expected to reach 3.3 billion jin. In order to further improve land utilization and develop grain production in the tense situation of the Great Leap Forward in Steel Production, the meeting planned the region's 8.6 million mu of farmland: all 600,000 mu of barren mountain slopes were returned to forest; 1 million mu of small terraced fields and slopes were managed extensively, planting buckwheat, peas, broad beans, and other minor grains, without specifying production targets, calculating the harvest as it comes; 7 million mu of good land were designated as "basic farmland," of which 1 million mu were planted with cash crops and vegetables, and 6 million mu were used as grain fields. These 6 million mu of "basic farmland" were further divided into fully intensively cultivated grain fields and generally intensively cultivated grain fields. Three million mu of fully intensively cultivated grain fields guarantee a yield of 5,000 jin per mu; 3 million mu of generally intensively cultivated grain fields guarantee a yield of 2,000 jin per mu. After the implementation of this plan, the total grain output of "basic farmland" alone in the region can reach 21 billion jin, an increase of more than five times compared with this year's estimated total grain output of 3.3 billion jin, exceeding this year's total grain output of Shanxi Province.

Regarding the yield increase measures for "basic farmland," the meeting required water, soil, fertilizer, seeds, and density to be implemented simultaneously, and to seize the current opportunity to deep-plow and accumulate fertilizer.

Before the 15th, the region had completed the deep-plowing and sowing tasks for 2.5 million mu of wheat fields. Currently, 500,000 to 600,000 farmers are deep-plowing the remaining 3.5 million mu of "basic farmland" at a rate of more than 100,000 mu per day.

This newspaper reported that farmers in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, are vigorously developing the movement of high-yield wheat satellite fields and are starting to plan for the "three-thirds system" of agricultural production (using one-third of the total cultivated land to grow crops, one-third to plant trees and grass, and one-third to lie fallow).

This year, farmers in Chang'an County cultivated a total of 74,000 mu of wheat satellite fields with yields of more than 10,000 jin per mu and 120,000 mu with yields of more than 6,000 jin per mu, accounting for 36% of the total wheat area next year. At present, these satellite fields have been basically sown, and various measures have generally met the requirements.

Before sowing, the county organized more than 1,570 satellite field professional teams and groups to carry out a technical reform movement centered on dense planting, and launched a surge of deep plowing and fertilizer production and accumulation. From July to September, the county accumulated a total of 88 billion jin of fertilizer. In addition to applying sufficient base fertilizer to large areas of wheat fields, satellite fields with yields of more than 6,000 jin per mu applied 100,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu and deep-plowed about 1.5 chi; those with yields of more than 10,000 jin per mu applied 200,000 to 300,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu and deep-plowed more than 2 chi; the most fertilizer applied was 2 million jin, of which more than 2,000 mu were deep-plowed more than 5 chi, and 550 mu were deep-plowed more than 1 zhang. These satellite fields have all undergone field design, and land utilization, fertilization, and irrigation have all reached garden-style standards. The cooperatives and teams have also generally carried out seed and dense planting experiments, and launched a campaign to contribute ideas and suggestions on "how to solve the problem of ventilation and light transmission." At present, each professional team is combining seedling inspection and seedling replanting to top-dress the satellite fields, and to fertilize based on the seedlings and individual plants, striving to eliminate the third category of seedlings before the ground freezes.

In order to adapt to the future development requirements of the large-scale satellite field movement, the leaders of Chang'an County have begun to fundamentally solve the water and fertilizer problems of satellite fields. In terms of water conservancy, Chang'an County has decided to vigorously develop well irrigation in plain areas and build large, medium, and small reservoirs in plateau areas. In terms of fertilizer, in order to solve the fertilizer needs of satellite fields, it has been decided that most of the wheat straw in the county will be used to compost fertilizer in the fields, except for some that will be used as livestock feed; at the same time, a large number of green manure crops will be developed. The people's communes have also established certain professional organizations, separated from large field production, and concentrated on cultivating satellite fields, so as to learn and familiarize themselves with operating techniques for a long time, and improve the quality of cultivation.

According to calculations, the total output of wheat satellite fields in the county next year will reach 1.52 billion jin, which is more than six times greater than the total output of all large field wheat in the county this year. With the realization of the satellite field planting plan for autumn crops, in the future, farmers in the county can rely on satellite fields for food, freeing up part of the land for greening and crop rotation. Now, the Chang'an County Committee of the CPC has initially put forward the design plan for the "three-thirds system" of agricultural production and has dispatched working groups to investigate and survey land utilization planning on a county basis. According to the design plan requirements, by 1962, all of the county's more than 2 million mu of mountainous land in remote mountainous areas must be greened and used as the county's timber forest base. The 400,000 mu of mountainous land in the near-mountain areas will be used to build economic forests, and the 80,000 mu of level terraced fields along the mountains will all be returned to cultivation to build fruit forests. The remaining land will be rotated and fallowed in appropriate proportions. From next year, the replanting will be planned to be compressed and the double cropping area will be expanded to ensure high yields. By 1962, the county's summer and autumn crops will be basically single-cropped, requiring 10,000 jin of grain and 1,000 jin of cotton per mu.

According to Dazhong Daily News: Shan County, Shandong Province, plans to plant 930,000 mu of wheat this year. The county committee has decided to turn 600,000 mu of early-season wheat into high-yield fields, requiring an average yield of 6,000 jin of wheat per mu, of which 60,000 mu of satellite fields require a yield of more than 20,000 jin per mu.

In order to make the large-area high-yield fields meet the sowing specification standards, at the beginning of wheat planting, the county committee put forward the requirements of "fourizations" and "seven goods," namely, land preparation being ridge-fieldized, operation being technicalized, sowing being standardized, and improved varieties being popularized; and land being deep-plowed well, fertilizer being applied well, land leveling and ridge field preparation being good, irrigation and stubble watering being good, seed treatment being good, sowing quality being good, and rolling and compaction being good. After the day and night battles of the people throughout the county, by October 7th, the 600,000 mu of early-season wheat had all been planted. After inspection and acceptance, the specification standards were basically met: deep plowing was more than 2 chi, satellite fields were deep plowed 5 chi to 7 chi; base fertilizer application was more than 200,000 jin, satellite fields reached more than 500,000 jin; sowing was more than 40 jin, satellite fields were about 100 jin. All seeds were selected, soaked, and mixed with pesticides and nitrogen-fixing bacteria before sowing, and mud water was used for floating seed selection. To prevent underground pests, pesticides were also generally applied. The wheat seeds were all improved varieties such as Bima No. 1, No. 4, and "Plain 50."

After the early-season wheat was sown, the county committee promptly put forward measures to strengthen field management: 600,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields, organized a professional management team of 60,000 people, fixed specific personnel, fixed plots, and were responsible from planting to harvesting. At present, they are particularly focusing on seedling inspection and replanting, conducting general inspections, classifying and ranking, proposing measures based on different situations, and making up lessons for each category.

    农田耕作制度大革命　少种高产多收巧安排
    大搞大面积高额丰产田
    河北安国县　大片高产片实现了耕作园田化
    山西长治专区　集中力量精耕细作“基本农田”
    陕西长安县　规划实行农业生产的“三三制”
    山东单县　把六十万亩早茬麦变成丰产田
    据河北日报消息　安国县在今年大丰收的基础上，大胆地进行了小麦耕作制度的革命。在全县将近二分之一的麦田上，大搞大片高产片，在大片高产片中，又套之以小片高额丰产田。仅这些高产片的收成，即可保证全县四十万亩麦田亩产达到五千斤。
    为了实现这个跃进的指标，中共安国县委提出了播种规格化、种植区域化、耕作园田化和优种化的要求，并制订了具体的操作规程，对深翻地、施肥、浇水、下种、耙轧等都提出了严格的规格和质量。
    为了保证种麦的规格质量，该县各公社的干部、社员，人人斗志昂扬，个个干劲冲天。他们的口号是：“半当整、女当男、一当十、百当千，决心种好麦，明年保五千。”各公社除推行了“十到田”外，还普遍采取了四减（减保育员、管理员、售货员、饲养员）和机关、学校上战场等办法。这样，全县参加翻地种麦的劳力达到了二十五万多人。干部和群众在野外建立了二百多个指挥部，一万一千多个战斗棚，把所有的劳力编成翻地、送粪、浇水、播种等各个专业队、组，以军事化的行动展开了日夜鏖战。到10月19日，今年全县应深翻的土地，已翻完三十八万亩，深度都在一尺二以上。其中有二十多万亩达到了一尺五寸以上。一般麦田施肥都在三万至五万斤以上；十八万亩大片高产片亩施肥八至十万斤；八万亩卫星田亩施肥二十二万斤。小麦的播种量每亩达到了五十斤以上。全县麦田都实现了畦田化，像过去老农种菜园子那样打耙了土地，真正达到了“地平如镜、埂直如线”。
    中共安国县委在制订明年小麦增产计划时，首先分析了全县农业大跃进的形势。今年全县粮食平均亩产可达到三千六百斤（夏季平均亩产四百九十一斤），比去年增产六倍多。县委根据这些事实，认为在实现了人民公社化的条件下，实现明年小麦亩产五千斤是完全有可能的。
    在县委提出了这一宏伟计划以后，各人民公社首先采取了大搞大片丰产田的革命措施。经过规划，全县划出了二十二大片小麦高产片。东风人民公社又进一步在大片高产片中套以小片高额丰产田。这个社共计划种植九万五千亩小麦，除规划出三个高产片（共六万多亩）外，又在伍仁桥村的高产片内划出了一千亩卫星田，力争平均亩产达到双万斤。这种大片套小片，小片带大面的方法，是小麦种植上的一个革命。它打破了原来小社的那种分散种植的方法，首先实现了种植区域化，达到了因地制宜，同时，也便于集中人力物力和技术力量，实现耕作园田化。中共安国县委在发现了东风人民公社这一创造后，立即加以推广。因此，各公社在大搞大片丰产田的同时，相继又出现了“万亩卫星田”等各种名称的八万多亩高产“卫星”田。
    本报讯　中共山西长治地委最近召开了各县市委第一书记会议，制定了明年农业大跃进计划，决定继续实行“基本农田”制，进一步放弃六十万亩高山贫瘠坡头，集中力量在“基本农田”上精耕细作，争取明年大面积高产。
    长治专区从去冬以来，即实行了“基本农田”制，有计划地放弃一部分耕地，在“基本农田”上实行精耕细作，获得了空前未有的丰收，今年预计总产量可达三十三亿斤。为了在大炼钢铁的紧张情况下进一步提高土地利用率，发展粮食生产，会议将全区八百六十万亩农田作了规划：把六十万亩高山贫瘠坡地全部退耕还林；一百万亩小块梯田和坡地粗放经营，栽种荞麦、豌豆、扇豆等各种小杂粮，不规定产量指标，收多少算多少；七百万亩好地作为“基本农田”，其中一百万亩栽种经济作物和蔬菜，六百万亩作粮田。这六百万亩“基本农田”中，又分为完全精耕粮田和一般精耕粮田。完全精耕粮田三百万亩，保证亩产五千斤；一般精耕粮田三百万亩，保证亩产二千斤。这个计划实现后，全专区仅“基本农田”粮食的总产量就可达到二百一十亿斤，比今年全专区预计粮食总产量三十三亿斤提高五倍多，超过今年山西全省粮食总产量。
    在“基本农田”的增产措施上，会议要求水、土、肥、种、密一齐上马，当前抓紧深翻地和积肥。
    15日以前，全区已经完成二百五十万亩麦田的深翻下种任务。现在五六十万农民，正在其余三百五十万亩“基本农田”上，以每日十多万亩的速度进行深翻。
    本报讯　陕西省长安县农民大搞小麦丰产卫星田运动，并着手进行农业生产“三三制”规划（用总耕地的三分之一种庄稼，三分之一种树种草，三分之一休闲）。
    今年，长安县农民共培养亩产万斤以上的小麦卫星田七万四千亩，亩产六千斤以上的十二万亩，共占明年小麦总面积的36％。目前，这些卫星田已基本播种完毕，各项措施一般都达到了要求。
    播种前，全县共组织了一千五百七十多个卫星田专业队、组，开展以密植为中心的技术改革运动，掀起突击深翻地和造肥、积肥高潮。从7月到9月，全县共积肥八百八十亿斤，除给大面积麦田施够底肥外，亩产六千斤以上的卫星田每亩施底肥十万斤，深翻一尺五寸左右；亩产万斤以上的，每亩施底肥二十至三十万斤，深翻二尺以上；最多的施肥达二百万斤，其中两千多亩深翻达五尺以上，五百五十亩深翻达一丈以上。这些卫星田都进行了田间设计，从土地利用到施肥、灌溉都达到园田化标准。各社队还普遍进行了种籽和密植试验，并开展了“如何解决通风透光问题”的献策献计运动。目前，各专业队正结合查苗补苗，给卫星田追肥，看苗看棵补肥，争取在地冻以前，突击消灭三类苗。
    为了适应大面积卫星田运动今后的发展要求，长安县领导上已着手从根本上解决卫星田的水、肥等问题。在水利方面，长安县决定在平川地区大力发展机井灌溉，在高原地区兴修大、中、小型水库。在肥料方面，为了解决卫星田肥料需要，决定把全县的麦草除部分作牲口饲料外，其余大部分用来在地头沤肥；同时，大量发展压青绿肥。各人民公社还成立了一定的专业组织，脱离大田生产，集中务育卫星田，以便长期集中学习、熟悉操作技术，提高耕作质量。
    根据推算，明年全县小麦卫星田的总产将达到十五亿二千万斤，比今年全县全部大田小麦的总产还要大六倍多，加上秋田作物卫星田种植规划的实现，今后全县农民就可以靠卫星田吃饭，腾出一部分土地进行绿化和轮作休耕。现在，中共长安县委已初步提出了农业生产“三三制”的设计方案，并派出工作组以县为单位调查勘查土地利用规划。根据设计方案要求，到1962年要把全县远山区的二百多万亩山地全部进行绿化，作为全县用材林基地。近山地区的四十万亩山地营造经济林，沿山地区的八万亩水平梯田，全部退耕营造水果林。剩余土地按照适当的比例进行轮作休耕，从明年起有计划地压缩复种、扩大正槎面积，以保证高额丰产，到1962年基本实现全县夏秋作物单作制，要求亩产万斤粮千斤棉。
                        （王　永）
    据大众日报消息　山东省单县今年计划种麦九十三万亩，县委决定把六十万亩早茬麦搞成丰产田，要求平均亩产小麦六千斤，其中六万亩卫星田要求亩产二万斤以上。
    为了使大面积丰产田达到播种规格标准，在种麦开始，县委即提出了“四化”、“七好”的要求，即整地畦田化，操作技术化，播种规格化，良种普及化；和土地深翻好，施肥好，平整土地畦田好，灌浇塌茬水好，种子处理好，播种质量好，砘压好。经过全县人民日夜奋战，到10月7日，六十万亩早茬麦已全部种完。经检查验收，基本达到了规格标准：深翻二尺以上，卫星田深翻五尺到七尺；施底肥二十万斤以上，卫星田达五十万斤以上；播种四十斤以上，卫星田百斤左右。播种前全部进行了选种、浸种和用农药及固氮菌拌种，泥水漂种。为防除地下虫害，还普遍施用了农药。小麦种子，全部用的是碧蚂一、四号和“平原五○”等良种。
    早茬麦播完之后，县委又及时提出了加强田间管理的措施：六十万亩大面积丰产田，组织了六万人的专业管理队伍，固定专人，固定地块，从种到收，负责到底。当前特别抓紧查苗补种，普遍进行检查，分类排队，分别不同情况，提出措施，逐类补课。（附图片）
