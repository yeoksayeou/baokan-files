    Black Metallurgical Design Institute Modifies Universal Design
    (Our dispatch) The universal designs for small blast furnaces of 3, 8, 13, 28, and 55 cubic meters, and small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises with an annual output of 6,000 to 100,000 tons of steel, designed by the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, have been widely adopted in various places during the Great Leap Forward in the steel industry. According to recent feedback from various locations, certain plant structures in these designs are not suitable for some areas, and some of the equipment specified in the designs is difficult for local machinery factories to manufacture. In order to build the steel industry more, faster, better, and more economically, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently instructed the Design Institute to make a major modification to these designs. After working day and night, the comrades of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute have completed the modification work on the small blast furnaces.
    The modified design greatly reduces the consumption of steel, refractory materials, and cement. For example, the amount of refractory bricks used in the 8 and 13 cubic meter small blast furnaces, which are widely used in various places, has been reduced from the original 75 tons and 85 tons to 14.5 tons and 20.5 tons respectively, and the amount of steel has been reduced from the original 2.7 tons and 9 tons to 1.2 tons and 1.3 tons, respectively. The amount of cement used has also been greatly reduced. The workshops for steelmaking and rolling with capacities of 50,000 tons and 100,000 tons have changed the original precast reinforced concrete structure to a brick-wood structure, and the equipment foundations have also been changed to low-grade cement or rubble masonry.
    In order to make the steel industry easier to operate, the Design Institute has also recompiled the universal designs for small-scale iron and steel joint enterprises with annual outputs of 6,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 tons of steel, based on the experience of various places. More thorough modifications have been made to the plant structure and equipment design. The plant buildings now use brick-wood structures, and the weight of some equipment has also been reduced to make it easier to cast and process. This new set of designs will be more suitable for the needs of various places.

    黑色冶金设计院修改通用设计
    本报讯　由冶金工业部黑色冶金设计总院设计的三、十八、十三、二十八、五十五立方公尺的小高炉，以及年产钢六千吨至十万吨的小型钢铁联合企业的通用设计，在钢铁工业的大跃进中，已为各地广泛采用。据最近各地反映，这批设计中的某些厂房结构，对一些地区还不合适，设计中规定的一些设备在地方机械厂里制造还有困难。为了更加多快好省地建设钢铁工业，冶金工业部最近指示设计院，对这批设计进行一次较大的修改。黑色冶金设计总院的同志经过夜以继日地奋战，小高炉的修改工作已经完成。
    修改后的设计大大减少了钢铁、耐火材料和水泥的用量，如为各地大量采用的八和十三立方公尺的小高炉所用耐火砖，由原来的七十五吨和八十五吨分别减至十四点五吨和二十点五吨，钢材由原来的二点七吨和九吨减为一点二吨和一点三吨，水泥用量也大大减少。五万吨和十万吨的炼钢车间和轧钢车间的厂房，把原来的预制钢筋混凝土结构改为砖木结构，设备基础也改用低标号水泥或用块石砌筑。
    为了使钢铁工业更易于举办，设计院又根据各地的经验，重新编制了年产钢六千、一万、二万、五万、十万吨的小型钢铁联合企业的通用设计，对厂房结构和设备设计都作了比较彻底的修改，厂房采用了砖木结构，一些设备也减轻了单件的重量，使其更便于铸造和加工。这批新的设计将更适于各地的需要。
