Xinhua News Agency, 30th. China's first jet-powered advanced trainer and a small civilian aircraft, the "Capital No. 1," following the "Beijing No. 1" made by the Aviation Institute, flew into the clear skies of Beijing again today. This is a precious gift from the workers of Beijing factories to the National Day and another major new achievement in China's aviation industry.

　　This jet trainer performed aerobatics during its test flight today. It sometimes flew to high altitude, suddenly dived, and somersaulted in the air; sometimes it flew to ultra-low altitude, then rose straight up, and rolled horizontally in the air. The test pilot praised the aircraft's good performance and ease of handling in his report on the test flight.

　　This aircraft has a speed of over 1,000 kilometers per hour and can fly to an altitude of over 14,000 meters. Except for the engine, all parts are manufactured by themselves and in cooperation with fraternal factories in the country.

　　The small civilian aircraft "Capital No. 1" can be used for transporting goods, sowing seeds, eliminating locusts, and as a civil aviation aircraft. It can carry eight passengers. Its structure is simple, and its fuselage is short. One does not need a ladder to board the plane; it's like getting into a car, you can step right in. The runway requirements for takeoff and landing are not high; a large football field is sufficient. All parts of this aircraft are manufactured by this factory itself and in cooperation with fraternal factories in the country. (Attached picture)

    北京制成两种新飞机
    喷气式教练机直上青云四万尺  小型民用机足球场上随意起落
    新华社30日讯　我国制造的第一架喷气式高级教练机和一架小型民用飞机“首都一号”，继航空学院制造的“北京一号”之后今天又飞上北京的晴空。这是北京工厂职工献给国庆节的珍贵礼物，也是我国航空工业的又一个重大的新成就。
    这架喷气式教练机今天在试飞的时候，作了特技表演。它时而飞到高空，猛然下滑，在空中翻跟斗；时而飞到超低空，然后直线上升，并且在空中横滚。试飞员报告试飞情况的时候，连声称赞飞机的性能好，驾驶起来得心应手。
    这架飞机的时速达一千多公里，能够飞上一万四千公尺以上的高空。除发动机外，全部部件都是他们自己制造和国内兄弟厂协作制造的。
    小型的民用飞机“首都一号”，可以运货、播种、灭蝗，也可以作为民用航空飞机用，能乘坐八个客人。它的结构简单，机身短小，上飞机不用梯子，同上汽车一样，一步就能踏进去；起落时用的跑道要求不高，大一点的足球场就可以起落。这架飞机的全部部件都是这个厂自己制造和国内兄弟厂协作制造的。（附图片）
    首都一号上了天，高级教练机也快起飞了。　（北京日报社稿）
