Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The spokesman of the Japanese Communist Party and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, Ii Yashiro, issued a statement today, strongly demanding that the United States withdraw all its troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area and stop interfering in the Chinese people's cause of unifying their own country.

Ii pointed out that a ceasefire is China's internal affair, and there is no so-called "ceasefire" between China and the United States; the United States is simply not qualified to interfere in this matter. Ii then emphasized that if the United States wants to take advantage of China's cessation of the bombardment of Jinmen to further intensify its war provocation conspiracy, then this conspiracy will be thoroughly crushed under the firm unity of the Chinese people.

Yasui Hayakawa, Permanent Director of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out that the cause of liberating Taiwan is the legitimate right of the Chinese people. The Chinese government has consistently maintained that as long as the United States stops interfering in China's internal affairs, the Chinese people are fully capable of resolving the Taiwan issue themselves. The measures taken by the Chinese government this time are a concrete manifestation of this position.

Hayakawa stated that the Japan Peace Committee firmly demands that the United States immediately withdraw from Taiwan and opposes the Japanese government's following the United States, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek Group, and assisting US-Chiang war provocations against China. He stated that the Peace Committee will further strengthen the struggle to make the Kishi Nobusuke government change its policy of assisting the US-Chiang and being hostile to China.

Kaoru Ota, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), also demanded that the US military immediately withdraw from Taiwan.

Ota stated that Sohyo will strengthen its unity with various Japanese people's organizations and political parties and launch a powerful movement to urge the Kishi Nobusuke government to sever all its relations with the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

    日本共产党、和平委员会和“总评”
    要求美军撤出台湾海峡地区
    谴责岸政府协助美国对中国的战争挑衅
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党发言人、中央委员会书记局书记伊井弥四郎今天发表谈话，强烈要求美国从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出它的一切军队，并且停止干涉中国人民统一自己国家的事业。
    伊井指出，停战是中国的内政问题，中国同美国之间没有所谓“停战”，美国根本没有资格干涉这个问题。伊井接着强调说，如果美国想利用中国停止炮轰金门的时机进一步加紧它的战争挑衅阴谋，那末这个阴谋将在中国人民坚决团结之下被彻底粉碎。
    日本和平委员会常任理事早川康弌指出，解放台湾的事业是中国人民正当的权利，中国政府一贯主张，只要美国停止干涉中国内政，中国人是完全能够自己解决台湾问题的。中国政府这次采取的措施是这种主张的具体表现。
    早川表示，日本和平委员会坚决要求美国立即撤出台湾，并且反对日本政府追随美国、勾结蒋介石集团，协助美、蒋对中国的战争挑衅。他表示，和平委员会将要进一步加强使岸信介政府改变协助美蒋和敌视中国的政策的斗争。
    日本工会总评议会议长太田熏也要求美国军队立即撤出台湾。
    太田表示，“总评”将加强同日本各人民团体和政党的团结，展开强有力的运动，以促使岸信介政府断绝它同蒋介石集团的一切关系。
