    The True Colors of American Colonialists Exposed

    On October 10th, twenty-four American oil businessmen and engineers who had set up tents near Madrejón in the Gran Chaco region of Paraguay, preparing to explore and exploit oil, were besieged by local Indian residents. On October 15th, the "New York Times" actually exaggerated this incident into a Western-style action-packed adventure story.

    What is the truth of the matter?

    The Gran Chaco region, bordering Bolivia to the north and Paraguay to the south, is rich in resources, especially known for its timber and oil reserves. Under the behind-the-scenes competition of American and British monopoly capital, Bolivia and Paraguay engaged in a long war to seize the Gran Chaco region. In 1938, the war ended, with Paraguay gaining three-quarters of the Gran Chaco region. As early as 1945, the American California United Oil Company obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in the Gran Chaco region for fifty years. In 1947, the Americans left the Gran Chaco. But in the second half of 1955, the Paraguayan government again allowed American oil monopoly organizations to exploit oil in the Gran Chaco region.

    The Indians reside in the Madrejón area of the Gran Chaco region.

    The vanguard of the American oil businessmen – missionaries – had already begun operations in the Gran Chaco region, using a city in southern Bolivia as their headquarters. In early September, two missionaries, representing the oil businessmen, entered the area inhabited by the Indians. They left some items as bribes and then left. On September 10th, these two missionaries, believing that the Indians had accepted the bribes, entered the Indian-inhabited area again with a translator, preparing to negotiate on behalf of the oil businessmen.

    The angry Indians beat the translator and also gave one of the missionaries a severe beating. On October 10th, they surrounded the tents of the oil businessmen, demanding that the colonialists get out. The Indians used their crude weapons: spears and bows and arrows to attack the tents. These weapons were very blunt and did not cause any casualties. But the colonialists revealed their ferocious faces and opened fire on the Indians. According to a report in the "New York Times" on October 15th, which tried its best to cover up the crimes of the colonialists, "They killed at least one Indian and injured another."

    The colonialists' massacre did not frighten the Indians. They surrounded the oil businessmen's tents and refused to retreat. On October 12th, the Paraguayan authorities sent a large number of troops to relieve the American oil businessmen.

    Now, under the protection of the Paraguayan army's bayonets, the American colonialists have decided to stay put and continue to explore and exploit oil in the Gran Chaco region.

    美国殖民者现形记
    10月10日，在巴拉圭大厦谷地区马德列松地方附近设下帐篷，准备勘探、开采石油的二十四名美国石油商人和工程师，遭受当地居民印第安人的围攻。10月15日，“纽约时报”竟把这件事渲染为美国西部武打惊险故事式的事件。
    事实的真相究竟是怎样的？
    大厦谷地区，北接玻利维亚、南邻巴拉圭、拥有丰富的资源，尤以木材和石油的蕴藏著称。在美、英垄断资本幕后的角逐下，玻利维亚与巴拉圭为了争夺大厦谷地区爆发过长期的战争。1938年，战争结束，巴拉圭取得四分之三的大厦谷地区。远在1945年，美国加利福尼亚联合石油公司就取得在大厦谷地区勘探和开采石油五十年的权利。1947年美国人离开了大厦谷。但是1955年下半年，巴拉圭政府又允许美国石油垄断组织在大厦谷地区开采石油。
    居住在大厦谷地区马德列松地方的是印第安人。
    美国石油商人的先遣部队——传教士，以玻利维亚南部的一个城市为总部，早就在大厦谷地区展开了活动。9月初，两名传教士代表石油商人进入印第安人居住的地区。他们留下一些贿赂的物品以后就走了。9月10日，这两名传教士以为印第安人接受了贿赂，于是携带一名翻译，再度进入印第安人居住地区，准备代表石油商人进行谈判。
    愤怒的印第安人，殴打了翻译，也痛揍了一名传教士。10月10日，他们包围了石油商人的帐篷，要求殖民者滚回去。印第安人用他们的粗陋的武器：标枪、弓箭向帐篷进攻。这些武器十分迟钝，并没有造成伤亡。但是殖民者露出了狰狞的面孔，开枪向印第安人射击，据“纽约时报”10月15日极力掩饰殖民者罪行的报道称：“他们至少打死了一名印第安人，打伤了一名。”
    殖民者的屠杀并没有吓倒印第安人。他们包围着石油商人的帐篷不肯后退。10月12日，巴拉圭当局派来了大批军队，才给美国石油商人解了围。
    现在，在巴拉圭军队刺刀的保护下，美国殖民者决定赖着不走，继续在大厦谷地区勘探、开采石油。
