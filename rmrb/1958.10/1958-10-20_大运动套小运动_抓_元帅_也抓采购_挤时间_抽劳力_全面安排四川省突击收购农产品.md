Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th. While grasping the two "marshals" of steel and grain, party leadership in Sichuan adopted the method of big campaigns encompassing small campaigns, squeezing time and extracting labor to make a rush purchase of agricultural products. There has been great progress in the procurement of cotton, live pigs, and many minor agricultural products.

Most agricultural products in the province are concentrated on the market in the fourth quarter, and the procurement tasks for major products have increased by 50% to 70% compared with last year. On the other hand, doing a good job in the steel front and the supply of materials for the peak season market is also a top priority. At the same time, after the realization of communization in the rural areas of the province, great changes have taken place in market laws, purchasing and marketing methods, etc. The task is heavy, the supply of materials and transportation, and labor are all tight. This is the situation currently facing rural purchasing and marketing work.

In light of this new situation, Party committees in various places, while arranging steel production and deep plowing, have adopted a blitz approach to carry out the procurement of agricultural products. When arranging the procurement of live pigs, the CPC Wenjiang Prefectural Committee divided the counties in the entire prefecture into groups, adopting the method of assigning people, assigning locations, assigning times, and assigning tasks, making arrangements at once, and carrying out segmented blitzes, squeezing out time for farmers to sell and deliver pigs. As a result, the purchase volume of live pigs doubled within ten days, achieving the goal of not hindering production or selling pigs. After this experience was promoted throughout the province, the purchase volume of live pigs greatly increased. Since the beginning of this year in Hujia District, Xuanhan County, farmers have been busy with agricultural production, squeezing out the production of many minor agricultural and sideline products. Recently, under the unified arrangement of the district committee, taking advantage of the gaps in replanting late autumn crops and autumn plowing, more than 30,000 people were organized to go to the mountains for one or two days to make a blitz collection of more than one million catties of wild fibers. Counties such as Fuling and Nanchuan used the gaps in production to hold "Finance and Trade Movement Weeks," organizing all the forces of state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and small vendors to contract to organize farmers to rush to pick tea, cut lacquer, and sell pigs. The farmers were very satisfied, and the supply and marketing cooperatives also purchased the agricultural products they needed.

The "small campaigns" carried out in various places to make a blitz purchase generally adopt the practice of "three days of preparation, one day of blitz, and one day of finishing work" to avoid affecting steel and grain production. In order to widely promote this experience throughout the province, the Sichuan Provincial Commercial Department summarized five experiences: (1) Focus on agricultural production, grasp the agricultural season, agricultural hard work, commercial preparation; agricultural rest, commercial blitz, to achieve every possible time, no idle people in work or rest; (2) conduct product line up according to season, to achieve produce what is collected; (3) the varieties of each blitz purchase should not exceed four or five; (4) the production progress varies from place to place, and the scope of small movements should not be too large, generally it is better to take the commune as a unit; (5) under the leadership of the Party committee, unify the organization of forces, set targets, assign tasks, contract by area, go deep into teams and households to facilitate the sale of the masses. In order to combine small movements with year-round purchases, people's communes in various places have included the task of purchasing agricultural products in the economic plans of the commune.

### 大运动套小运动  抓“元帅”也抓采购  挤时间　抽劳力　全面安排四川省突击收购农产品

    大运动套小运动
    抓“元帅”也抓采购
    挤时间　抽劳力　全面安排四川省突击收购农产品
    新华社成都19日电　四川各地党的领导在抓钢铁、粮食两个“元帅”的同时，采取大运动套小运动的方法，挤时间、抽劳力，突击采购农产品，棉花、生猪和许多小宗农产品的收购都有很大进展。
    全省大部分农产品都集中在第四季度上市，主要产品的收购任务比去年增加50％至70％；另一方面做好钢铁战线和旺季市场物资供应工作，又是当务之急；同时，全省农村实现公社化后，市场规律、购销方式方法等都发生了巨大的变化。任务大，物资供应和运输、劳动力都很紧张，这就是当前农村购销工作面临的情况。
    各地党委根据这种新情况，在安排钢铁生产和深耕的同时，采用突击的办法开展农产品收购工作。中共温江地委在安排生猪的收购工作时，把全专区各县划分为组，采取定人、定点、定时、定任务，一次安排，分段突击的办法，挤出了时间让农民卖猪、送猪。结果十天内就使生猪收购量上升一倍，做到生产、卖猪两不误。全省推广这个经验后，生猪收购量大大增加。宣汉县胡家区今年以来，农民一直忙于农业生产，把许多小宗农副产品的生产挤掉了。最近，在区委统一安排下，利用补种晚秋作物和秋耕的空隙，抽出一、二天时间，组织了三万多人上山，突击采摘了一百多万斤野生纤维。涪陵、南川等县利用生产空隙举行“财经运动周”，把国营商店、供销社和小商贩的力量全部组织起来，分片包干组织农民突击采茶、割漆、售猪，农民很满意，供销社也收购到了需要的农产品。
    各地开展“小运动”突击收购，一般是采取“三天准备、一天突击、一天扫尾”的作法，以免影响钢铁、粮食生产。为了使这项经验在全省广泛推广，四川省商业部门总结了五项经验：（1）围绕农业生产，掌握农业季节，农业苦战、商业备战；农业休整、商业突击，做到见缝插针，工休无闲人；（2）根据季节进行产品排队，做到产啥收啥；（3）每次突击收购的品种不超过四、五种；（4）各地生产进度不一，开展小运动的范围不宜过大，一般以公社为单位为好；（5）在党委领导下，统一组织力量，提指标，下任务，分片包干，深入队、户，便利群众出售。为了使小运动和常年收购结合起来，各地人民公社都把农产品采购任务列入了公社的经济计划。（附图片）
