Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd. Prominent Korean and Chinese poets held a grand poetry evening tonight at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang to celebrate "Sino-Korean Friendship Month." At the meeting, the poets recited their own works, enthusiastically praising the great achievements and brotherly fighting friendship created by the people of the two countries, China and Korea, in their common struggle against the aggression of the American imperialists.

At the evening party, eight Korean poets recited poems they had written praising the friendship between China and Korea and the Chinese People's Volunteers. The gray-haired, well-known Korean old poet Park Se-yong recited at the meeting: "Your great achievements have been embroidered into our solemn construction picture, golden waves are rolling in the fields, and the heroic land is shining like the morning glow. Please convey all this to 600 million Chinese brothers."

The famous Korean veteran poet Park Pal-yang, who had visited China, recited a poem he wrote entitled "Friendship Deeper Than the Sea." The poem says: "In the dawning land of Asia, the victorious 600 million people are our brothers. They have opened up the road of friendship in the towering Tianshan Mountains and built a dam of happiness on the Wanli Yellow River. This is a friendship deeper than the sea, a friendship forged with blood. Unforgettable comrades, our brothers - the Chinese people."

Amidst warm applause, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation and a famous poet, took the stage and recited four poems he wrote during his visit to Korea, one of which was: "The flags of the two countries are red on both sides of the road, and the train speeds across the Yalu River. The mountains and rivers are stained with blue blood, and the soil is fertile with abundant autumn harvests. A burst of drum sounds echoes in the bright sun, and the dragon dance sways in the gentle breeze. A short stay at the station is hard to part with, eight years of fighting side by side is different."

Ding Chi, a colonel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Wang Jianmin, a member of the Chinese People's Volunteers' cultural troupe, also recited poems they had written. Wang Jianmin wrote in his poem entitled "Good Brothers": "A pair of good brothers, always together, we fought guerrillas in the Changbai Mountains, sang the same song, held the same flag, defeated the Japanese devils, for me and for you, in Shangganling, we fought as snipers, guarded the same position, ate the same handful of coarse rice, defeated the American robbers, and forged a deep friendship. For the sake of peace, we must separate, but if the enemy launches another war, they will be doubly beaten."

Today's poetry evening was sponsored by the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' League.

Before the recitation began, Han Xueye, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' League, said in his speech that the Korean people will never forget the great achievements and deep friendship established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea. Therefore, the poets sing with boiling enthusiasm, and will forever sing the immortal feats of the great Chinese people and their sons and daughters - the Chinese People's Volunteer comrades.

More than 800 people attended today's evening party, including people from the Korean literary and art circles and various circles of the Party, government, and military, as well as the Chinese People's Delegation and representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th. Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, recently wrote poems praising Sino-Korean friendship during his visit to Korea.

"Rodong Sinmun" and "Pyongyang Sinmun" today published the poems personally inscribed by Guo Moruo for these two newspapers, and also published the Korean translation.

The poem that Guo Moruo inscribed for "Pyongyang Sinmun" is: "Sino-Korean friendship forged in blood, brothers fighting side-by-side, living and dying together. The mountain stream flows with sweat, and the stubborn stones in the moat turn into smoke. The heroic city shines again, and the martyrs' cemetery lasts for eternity. No wonder it is so difficult to part, the hair is braided into shoes to send people on their way."

Guo Moruo recited four poems he had recently written at the poetry evening celebrating "Sino-Korean Friendship Month" on the 22nd, one of which was: "The mat in Panmunjom is still there, a line separates two different skies. The south fields are deserted and become wasteland, and the north mountains have birds praising the abundant years. The world can see clearly, and the two devils patrol back and forth. The paper tiger is wounded but still flaunts its power, pitying itself for running into the fiery pit." Another poem is: "Aiding Korea to resist America to defend peace, the relationship between lips and teeth is clear. The martyrs seek benevolence without regret, and the good neighbors cherish virtue with much affection. The rivers and mountains are beautiful for three thousand miles, and the treasured swords are sharpened for ten thousand. Watch for the day when the evil atmosphere is swept away, and the southern sky is clear to save all living beings."

    中朝友谊血凝成　兄弟并肩死共生
    朝中诗人赋诗歌颂中朝友谊
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜和中国著名诗人为了庆祝“朝中友好月”，今天晚上在平壤市牡丹峰剧场举行盛大的诗人晚会。诗人们在会上朗诵了他们自己的作品，热情地歌颂了朝中两国人民在共同反抗美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中所创造的伟大功勋和兄弟般的战斗友谊。
    在晚会上，有八位朝鲜诗人朗诵了他们自己写的歌颂朝中友谊和中国人民志愿军的诗。白发苍苍的朝鲜著名老诗人朴世永在会上朗诵道：“你们的丰功伟绩已绣入我们的庄严的建设图画中，田野上翻起金色的波浪，英雄的土地像朝霞般的灿烂发光，请把这一切转告六亿中国兄弟。”
    曾经访问过中国的朝鲜著名老诗人朴八阳朗诵了他的一首题为
  “比大海还深的友谊”的诗。这首诗说：“破晓的亚洲大地，胜利了的六亿人民是我们的兄弟，他们在天山的峻岭开辟了友谊的道路，在万里的黄河上筑起了幸福的堤坝，这是比海还深的友谊，这是用鲜血结成的友谊，永远不能忘记的战友，是我们的兄弟——中国人民。”
    在热烈的掌声中，中国人民代表团团长、著名诗人郭沫若登台朗诵他在访问朝鲜期间写的四首诗，其中一首是：“两国旌旗夹道红，火轮驰过鸭江东。山川碧血遗痕在，土壤膏膄秋获丰。一片鼓声通皓日，几圆龙舞漾和风，站头小驻犹难别，八载并肩自不同。”
    中国人民志愿军丁池上校和志愿军文工团团员王建民等三个人也在会上朗诵了他们自己写的诗。王建民在题为“好兄弟”的诗中写道：“一对好兄弟，永远在一起，长白山上我们打过游击，合唱一支歌，同举一样旗，打垮日本鬼，为我也为你，上甘岭上，我们打过狙击，共守一个阵地，同吃一把糙米，打败了美国强盗，结下了深情厚谊，为了和平，我们就要分离，如果敌人再发动战争，就会遭到加倍的打击。”
    今天的诗人晚会是由朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会主办的。
    朗诵开始以前，朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会委员长韩雪野在致词时说，朝鲜人民永远忘不了中国人民志愿军在朝鲜建立的丰功和深厚的友谊，因此，诗人们以沸腾的热情歌颂，而且今后将永远歌颂伟大的中国人民和他们的儿女——中国人民志愿军同志们的不朽功勋。
    参加今天晚会的有八百多人，其中包括朝鲜文学艺术界和党、政、军各界人士，以及中国人民代表团和中国人民志愿军代表。
    新华社平壤24日电　中国人民代表团团长郭沫若最近在访问朝鲜时，作诗热情歌颂中朝友谊。
      “劳动新闻”和“平壤新闻”今天刊载了郭沫若亲笔为这两家报纸题的诗，并且刊出了朝文译文。
    郭沫若为“平壤新闻”题的诗是：“中朝友谊血凝成，兄弟并肩死共生。洞里流泉随汗滴，濠中顽石化烟横。英雄城市辉重日，烈士陵园亘万龄。无怪依依难割舍，发编双履送人行。”
    郭沫若22日在庆祝“朝中友好月”的诗人晚会上曾经朗诵了他最近写的四首诗，其中一首是：“板门店里席依然，一线分开两样天。南甸无人成废地，北山有鸟颂丰年。万方视听明而彻，二鬼巡逻往复旋。纸虎鳞伤犹耀武，剧怜自窜火坑边。”另一首是：“援朝抗美卫和平，唇齿辅车事理明。烈士求仁无点憾，善邻怀德甚多情。江山锦秀三千里，宝剑磨砻十万横。指日妖氛看荡扫，南天晴朗济苍生。”
