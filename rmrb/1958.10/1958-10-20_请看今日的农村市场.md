    Look at Today's Rural Market
    Car water pumps, tractors, steel, explosives, telephones
    Kerosene lamps, fertilizer, canvas tarpaulins - now that the families are large and the businesses are big, they can afford them!
    Large pots and large steamers sell well, small pots and small bowls are ignored.
    Fountain pens and ink are swept away, thermos bottles are brought home.
    Little twill fabric or plain cloth is bought, but hot items are gabardine and serge.
    Towels and toothpaste are used by everyone, every household buys spittoons.
    Basketballs and volleyballs are sold out, after buying gongs and drums, they buy flutes.
    The supply and marketing cooperative of Zong'ai Town, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, conducted a survey and research in the newly established People's Commune for more than a month, and found five major characteristics of market changes after communization: large, new, many, urgent, and good. These five new characteristics have already been reflected in the current supply and marketing business.
    The economic composition of the People's Commune is the all-round development of agriculture, industry, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. It has its own small-scale industry, and many small agricultural tools and simple machines can be manufactured and distributed directly, and are no longer traded in the market or supplied through commercial departments. The Xin Sheng People's Commune has established a total of 408 small factories and 156 iron smelting furnaces. Small agricultural tools can generally be self-sufficient. The commune requires the supply of large agricultural machinery that it cannot produce itself, materials for steel production, and cooking utensils for the collective canteen. According to statistics from the production teams, a total of 20 large tractors, 100 universal tractors, 50 cars, power mills, grinders, and water pumps each, 100 mules and horses, 200 kerosene lamps, 200 flatbed carts, 20 telephones, 1.5 million jin of smokeless coal, and 3.3 million jin of chemical fertilizers are needed, as well as a large amount of steel, canvas tarpaulins, iron hammers, drill rods, explosives, etc. In terms of large cooking utensils, according to preliminary estimates, the entire commune needs 150 large iron pots, 150 large steamers, 50 blowers, 50 tea stoves, 100 bellows, 15,000 large bowls, 1,000 rice buckets, and 500 gourd ladles. Large bowls used to sell very little, but by the end of August, all 340 in stock had been sold. Small bowls and small pots that used to be used by individual households sell very little or simply no one wants them. The original small pots were sold as scrap iron.
    Since most of the commune members eat in the canteen, and there is no fire at home, matches are needed for smoking and lighting, and boiled water needs to be brought back from the canteen. Therefore, the sales of matches and thermos bottles have greatly increased. In early September, the sales of matches increased 28 times compared with the same period last month. In the past, only a dozen thermos bottles were sold each month, but in August, 150 were sold.
    Large-scale means of production are purchased by the commune, and the purchasing power of individual commune members, in addition to adding a few necessary small agricultural tools, has begun to shift to daily-use industrial products. Most of the cotton cloth is of high-grade varieties, such as canvas, gabardine, double-sided card, and corduroy, and sales have increased sharply. Serge used to be bought only by a few people to make shoe uppers, but now some people use it for clothing. Twill and fine cloth, which used to sell well, have now decreased a lot. Because women participate in labor and have no time to sew clothes and socks, the commune has established a sewing factory, and nine sewing machines have been sold within a few days, while only two were sold in the first half of the year. According to statistics, the entire commune needs 50 sewing machines. After the sewing factory was built, the commune members mostly had their clothes made to measure. In August, 36 pieces of ready-made clothes were sold, a decrease of one and a half times compared with the previous month. The sales of woolen sweaters, woolen blankets, rubber shoes, socks, children's toys, cigarettes, and bottled wine have all increased.
    Since the establishment of the commune, the number of schools has increased, and the number of primary and middle school students has increased by 55% and 73% respectively compared with last year. Therefore, cultural and educational supplies are selling greatly, and some are varieties that could not be sold or operated in the past. For example, Chicken Brand ink, which had been in stock for several years, has become a best-selling item, and the 72 iridium gold pens that had been stored for a long time have been sold out. At the same time, the commune has established clubs and amateur theatrical troupes, and the demand for musical instruments such as gongs and drums is very urgent. Basketballs and volleyballs that had been in stock for four years have been sold out.
    The health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, under the supervision and inspection of the commune, is more widespread and in-depth. Spittoons could not be sold at all in the past, and the supply and marketing cooperative had never operated them, but now every household has to buy them. The sales of towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and soap have all increased several times. Recently, because commune members have successively painted doors and windows to beautify their homes, Yongming paint, advertising oil, dyes, etc., which the supply and marketing cooperative had not operated in the past, have begun to be sold in larger quantities.

    请看今日的农村市场
    汽车水泵拖拉机　钢材炸药电话机
    汽灯化肥帆布棚　家大业大买得起
    大锅大笼卖得多　小锅小碗没人理
    金笔墨水一扫光　开水暖瓶往家提
    斜纹平布买的少　热货卡机华达呢
    毛巾牙膏人人用　家家户户买痰盂
    篮球排球都卖尽　买了锣鼓买箫笛
    山西寿阳县宗艾镇供销社在新生人民公社作了一个多月的调查研究，找出公社化以后市场变化的五大特点——大、新、多、急、好。这五个新的特点，已经在目前的供销业务中体现了出来。
    人民公社的经济组成是农工林牧副全面发展，本身有小型工业，许多小农具、简单机械可以自行制造，直接分配，不再在市场交易或通过商业部门供应了。新生人民公社共建立四百零八个小型工厂，一百五十六个炼铁炉，小农具一般都能自给自足。公社要求供应自己不能生产的大型农械、钢铁生产用的物资和集体食堂的炊事用具。据各生产队统计，共需大型拖拉机二十台，万能拖拉机一百台，汽车及动力磨、碾、水泵各五十个，骡马一百匹，汽灯二百盏，平车二百辆，电话机二十部，无烟煤一百五十万斤，化肥三百三十万斤，还有大量的钢材、帆布棚、铁锤、炮钎、炸药等。在大型炊事用具方面，据初步估算，全社需要大铁锅一百五十口，大笼一百五十套，吹风机五十架，茶炉五十个，风箱一百个，大碗一万五千个，饭桶一千个，葫芦瓢五百个。 大碗过去销量很少，8月下旬即销出了全部库存三百四十个。过去一家一户用的小碗、小锅卖的很少或干脆没人要，原有的小锅都当作废铁出售了。
    由于社员吃饭大多数到了食堂，家里不生火，吸烟、点灯都需要火柴，开水需要从食堂打回来，火柴和暖水瓶的销量因此大大增加。9月上旬火柴的销量比上月同期增加二十八倍。暖水瓶过去每月只销十余个，8月份销出了一百五十个。
    大型生产资料由公社购买，社员个人的购买力除添买少数必要的小农具之外，已开始转移到日用工业品方面。棉布大多要高档品种，如帆布、华达呢、双面卡、灯芯绒销量突增，冲服呢过去只是少数地被买去做鞋面，现在有人用做衣料、过去销量大的斜纹、细布现在减少了许多，由于妇女参加劳动，无暇缝衣做鞋袜，公社成立了缝纫厂，缝纫机几天之内就销售了九架，而上半年仅销出二架。据统计，全社共需五十架，缝纫厂建成后，社员们多量体做衣，8月份成衣销售三十六件，比上月下降一倍半。绒衣、线毯、胶鞋、袜子、儿童玩具、纸烟、瓶酒等的销量都有增加。
    公社建立以后，学校增多，小学生和中学生比去年分别增加55％和73％以上，因此，文教用品大大行销起来，有些是过去卖不了和不经营的品种，如积压了几年的鸡牌墨水变成畅销货，长期积存的七十二支铱金笔已销售一空。同时，公社建立了俱乐部和业余剧团，对锣、鼓等乐器要求很迫切，积压四年之久的篮球、排球都卖光了。
    以除四害为中心的卫生运动，在公社的督促检查下，更加普遍深入，痰盂已往根本卖不了，供销社也没经营过，现在家家都要买。毛巾、牙刷、牙膏、肥皂的销量都成倍地增加。近来，因为社员们相继油刷门窗，美化家庭，供销社过去没有经营过的永明漆、广告油、染色等开始较大量地销售。
