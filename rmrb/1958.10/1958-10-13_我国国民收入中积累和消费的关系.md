The level of a country's national income basically reflects the country's production level and national strength. The distribution relationship of national income is determined by the country's relations of production. In capitalist countries, because the means of production are privately owned by capitalists, the vast majority of the national income created by the working people every year is seized by the capitalists for their own use and used to support their huge state apparatus, with very little share going to the working people. In socialist countries, because there are no exploiting classes who reap without sowing, and the means of production are owned by the whole people and collectively by the working people, the national income created by the working people every year belongs entirely to themselves and is distributed within the working people.

During China's First Five-Year Plan, with the rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production and the rapid development of construction, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commerce, national income also grew rapidly, with an average annual growth of about 9% from 1952 to 1957. This growth rate is not only unprecedented in China's history, but also significantly higher than that of industrialized capitalist countries. From 1952 to 1957, the national income of the United States grew at an average annual rate of about 2.7%, and the national income of the United Kingdom grew at an average annual rate of about 2.9%. Such a rapid growth rate of China's national income fully demonstrates the great superiority of China's socialist system.

At present, China's national income level is still relatively low compared with major countries in the world. This determines that the living standards of the Chinese people can only be temporarily lower, and the scale of accumulation must be limited to a certain extent. However, with the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, national income will grow rapidly, the people's living standards will continue to improve significantly, and a large amount of accumulation can be increased, so that China's production level and people's living standards can quickly catch up with the advanced countries in the world. In socialist countries, the distribution of accumulation and consumption in the use of national income is fundamentally unified. The purpose of accumulation is to increase the funds for expanded reproduction, promote the overall leap forward of the entire national economy, and ensure the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society. However, there are also contradictions between the two. Accumulation basically represents the collective and long-term interests of the people, while consumption basically represents the individual and current interests of the people. To increase accumulation will, to some extent, reduce consumption in a certain period of time. Therefore, correctly handling the distribution of accumulation and consumption is not only a major issue related to the speed of China's socialist construction, but also a fundamental issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people. The principle for handling this issue should be: starting from 600 million people, "overall planning and appropriate arrangement."

During China's First Five-Year Plan, with the rapid growth of national income, both accumulation funds and consumption funds grew rapidly. Compared with 1952, accumulation funds increased by 77%, and consumption funds increased by 40%. The ratio of accumulation to consumption was 19.7% to 80.3% in 1952 and 23.7% to 76.3% in 1957, with an average of 23% to 77% over the five years. This means that the proportion of accumulation has been steadily increasing year by year.

Some comrades, seeing that the current living standards of the Chinese people are still relatively low, and that the growth rate of accumulation has been faster than the growth rate of consumption in the past few years, with the proportion of accumulation gradually increasing, believe that the accumulation rate is too high and advocate reducing accumulation and increasing consumption to further improve the people's living standards. This view is incorrect. First of all, we admit that although the living standards of the Chinese people have greatly improved compared with the past, they are indeed still very low compared with other advanced countries. The fundamental reason for this is that China's economy is backward and its productivity level is still low, not because there is too much accumulation. Looking at the situation in the past few years, China's national income has increased by an average of more than 6 billion yuan each year. After deducting about 1.3 billion yuan of consumption funds that must be increased each year due to population growth (about 13 million), there are only about 5 billion yuan left that can be used to increase accumulation and consumption. Even if this part of the national income is entirely used to improve consumption, the per capita consumption amount can only be increased by about 8 yuan per year, and the living standards are still very low. Secondly, to change the current situation of China's economic backwardness and low living standards, the most fundamental way is to develop production. For this reason, it is necessary to increase accumulation as much and as quickly as possible on the basis of the continuous increase of national income and under the principle of ensuring that the people's living standards are gradually improved, and to increase investment in expanded reproduction.

In addition, it must be pointed out that many comrades often simply regard the increase of accumulation funds as something that directly contradicts the improvement of the current people's lives. In fact, this is incorrect and incomplete. Accumulation funds include two parts: one part, which is also the main part, is productive accumulation, such as newly built factories, mines, reservoirs, railways, and newly added machinery, equipment, raw materials for production, fuel, etc.; the other part is consumer accumulation, such as newly built schools, hospitals, residential buildings, cinemas, theaters, newly added public transportation equipment, and various consumer goods (grain, cotton cloth, cooking oil, sugar, daily necessities, etc.) reserves, etc. The former is used to expand reproduction, while the latter is directly used to improve the current lives of the people and to meet the consumption needs of the people. Therefore, when explaining whether the accumulation rate is high or low and its relationship with the current lives of the people, it is necessary to analyze the composition of the accumulation funds at the same time. Only in this way can we comprehensively and accurately explain the problem.

During China's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, what will be the trend of the ratio of accumulation and consumption in the use of national income due to the several-fold or dozens-fold upward growth of industrial and agricultural production, and is it necessary to continue to increase the proportion of accumulation? It is absolutely necessary. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his work report at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Under the conditions of production development and gradual improvement of people's lives, both the state-owned economy and the collective economy should appropriately increase the proportion of accumulation in the national income in order to carry out socialist construction more and faster." Experience has proven that only with more productive accumulation can there be a reliable material guarantee for further expanded reproduction.

Is it possible to increase the proportion of accumulation in the national income? The answer is also affirmative. As everyone knows, the amount and speed of accumulation are most fundamentally determined by production. As long as production grows rapidly and national income increases rapidly, it is possible for accumulation to grow more and faster. Judging from the current situation, the growth rate of China's industrial production and agricultural production this year will greatly exceed any year during the First Five-Year Plan. This unprecedented new situation of a great leap forward in production provides a huge possibility for further increasing accumulation and raising the proportion of accumulation in the national income. Not only is this the case in industry, but even in agriculture, which was once considered to have a low accumulation ratio, the situation has changed significantly after the agricultural production cooperatives were transformed into people's communes after the great leap forward in production, and it is also possible to greatly increase accumulation. For example, last year the accumulated public welfare funds of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide were only about 3 billion yuan, but this year it may increase by two or three times, which will be much more than the total amount of public welfare funds accumulated in the past two years. In the past two years, the proportion of public welfare funds drawn by agricultural production cooperatives in various places accounted for only a little more than 10% of net income. This year and in the next few years, according to the data of some people's communes, the proportion of public welfare funds in net income may increase to more than 30% or even 40%. Even so, the lives of farmers can be greatly improved compared to the past few years. Therefore, the view of some people that China has a large population, so consumption must be high and accumulation cannot be high, is wrong.

Increasing the proportion of accumulation in the use of national income will not affect the improvement of people's lives. What we mean by increasing the proportion of accumulation and reducing the proportion of consumption refers to the relative proportion in the distribution of all national income. Due to the expansion of the total amount of national income, although the proportion of consumption funds is reduced, its absolute amount still has a significant increase. It does not mean reducing the absolute amount of consumption funds to increase accumulation funds. Facts have proven that in the case of high-speed development of various production undertakings and high-speed growth of national income, maintaining the growth rate of accumulation funds faster than the growth rate of consumption funds can still ensure that the people's lives continue to improve significantly, and can greatly increase accumulation and significantly increase the proportion of accumulation in the national income. For example, suppose that the national income during the First Five-Year Plan was 100, of which accumulation funds accounted for 23 and consumption funds accounted for 77. If the national income during the Second Five-Year Plan increases to 300, even if the proportion of accumulation funds is increased to 40% and the proportion of consumption funds is reduced to 60%, the absolute amount of consumption funds will still increase from 77 to 180, that is, an increase of more than 130%, and the people's living standards can still be greatly improved. It can be seen from this that as long as the premise is the rapid development of production, any concerns about the increase in the proportion of accumulation are unfounded.

The ratio of accumulation and consumption in the use of national income and its changes have objective laws. Experience has proven that the amount and speed of accumulation are mainly determined by production. Only when production develops rapidly and national income increases rapidly can accumulation grow more and faster. Similarly, only when there is more and faster productive accumulation can there be a reliable material guarantee for further expanded reproduction. Therefore, it can be said that the relationship between accumulation and production is mutually reinforcing and complementary. We should proceed from the basic point of actively developing production to continuously increase accumulation and rationally arrange the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption. Not focusing on actively developing production, but simply focusing on the distribution aspect and mechanically and statically balancing the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption is a passive and therefore wrong approach. Secondly, it is determined by consumption. In the development of production, it is necessary to ensure that the people's living standards are gradually improved. It is wrong to only pay attention to developing production and expanding accumulation without paying attention to improving the people's lives. However, because the demands for improving people's lives are endless and the growth of national income is limited, the speed of improving lives must be appropriately arranged. Otherwise, although production develops and national income increases, but if we do not pay attention to rational distribution, and do not arrange consumption according to the principle of gradually improving people's lives, but instead have a great leap forward in production and also a step-up in life, then it will still be impossible for accumulation to have more and faster growth, and it may even decrease. This is obviously completely contrary to the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift.

Dialectical materialism tells us that objective things are developing and changing, and any proportional relationship in the development of the national economy is not and cannot be fixed and unchanging. Production is constantly leaping forward, needs are constantly changing, and correspondingly, various proportional relationships in the development of the national economy, including the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption, will inevitably continue to change. The development of facts is just as Chairman Mao said in his famous speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In the economy of ownership by the whole people and the economy of collective ownership, between these two forms of socialist economy, the issue of the distribution of accumulation and consumption is a complex issue, and it is not easy to completely resolve it reasonably at once... Our country makes an economic plan once a year, arranges an appropriate proportion of accumulation and consumption, and seeks a balance between production and needs. The so-called balance is the temporary and relative unity of contradictions. After a year, generally speaking, this balance is broken by the struggle of contradictions, this unity changes, balance becomes imbalance, unity becomes disunity, and it is necessary to make a balance and unity for the second year. This is the superiority of our planned economy."

We must face up to the contradiction between social production and social needs that will objectively exist for a long time, and make full use of the superiority of China's socialist planned economy to constantly pay attention to rationally arranging and adjusting the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption; organically combine the individual interests and collective interests, current interests and long-term interests of the people, and build China into a great country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

    我国国民收入中积累和消费的关系
    杨波
    每个国家的国民收入水平的高低，基本上反映着这个国家的生产水平和国力的大小；国民收入的分配关系，则决定于这个国家的生产关系。在资本主义国家里，由于生产资料归资本家私人占有，劳动人民每年创造的国民收入，绝大部分都被资本家攫为己有，和用以豢养其庞大的国家机构，劳动人民所得的份额很少。在社会主义国家里，由于没有不劳而获的剥削阶级，生产资料归全民所有和劳动人民集体所有，因之，劳动人民每年创造的国民收入，也就全部归自己所有，在劳动人民内部进行分配。
    我国第一个五年计划期间，随着工农业生产的迅速增长，建筑业、运输邮电业和商业的迅速发展，国民收入也有了很快的增长，从1952年到1957年每年平均增长9％左右。这一增长速度，不仅是我国历史上从来没有过的，而且也大大高于工业发达的资本主义国家。从1952年到1957年美国的国民收入每年平均增长2.7％左右；英国的国民收入每年平均增长2.9％左右。我国国民收入增长速度这样快，充分证明了我国社会主义制度的巨大优越性。
    目前我国的国民收入水平，同世界上各个主要国家比较起来，还是比较低的。这一点决定了我国人民的生活水平暂时只能低一点，积累的规模也不能不受到一定的限制。但是，随着我国工农业生产的大跃进，国民收入将很快增长，人民生活水平将不断有显著提高，又能大量地增加积累，使我国的生产水平和人民生活水平迅速赶上世界先进国家。在社会主义国家里，国民收入使用中积累和消费之间的分配，从根本上说是统一的。积累的目的，是为增加扩大再生产的资金，促进整个国民经济的全面跃进，保证全社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。但是，两者之间也存在着矛盾。积累基本上代表着人民的集体利益和长远利益，消费基本上代表着人民的个人利益和目前利益；要增加积累，就会在一定时期内或多或少地减少消费。因之，正确处理积累和消费的分配问题，不仅是一个关系到我国社会主义建设速度的重大问题，而且也是一个正确处理人民内部矛盾的基本问题。处理这一问题的原则，应该是：从六亿人口出发，“统筹兼顾、适当安排”。
    我国第一个五年计划期间，随着国民收入的迅速增长，积累基金和消费基金都有很快的增长。1957年同1952年比较，积累基金增长了77％，消费基金增长了40％；积累和消费的比例是：1952年19.7％比80.3％， 1957年23.7％比76.3％，五年平均是23％比77％。这就是说，积累所占的比重，是逐年稳步上升的。
    有的同志看到目前我国人民生活水平还比较低，而过去几年中积累的增长速度又快于消费的增长速度，积累所占比重逐渐提高，就认为积累率高了，主张减少积累增加消费，更多地改善人民生活。这种意见是不对的。首先，我们承认，目前我国人民的生活水平，虽比过去有很大提高，但与其它先进的国家比较起来，确实还是很低的。其根本原因在于我国经济落后，生产力水平还较低，而不是因为积累多了。从过去几年的情况看，我国的国民收入每年平均增加约六十多亿元，除去每年因人口增加
  （约一千三百万左右）而必须增加的消费基金约十三亿元左右外，剩下可以用于增加积累和消费的只有五十亿元左右，即使把这部分国民收入全部用于提高消费，每人每年的消费额也只能提高八元左右，生活水平依然是很低的。其次，要改变我国经济落后、人民生活水平低的现状，最根本的办法是发展生产。为此，就应该在国民收入不断增加的基础上，在保证人民生活逐步有所提高的原则下，尽可能多地快地增加积累，增加扩大再生产的投资。
    此外，还必须说明一点，就是许多同志往往把积累基金的增加，简单地看成都是同改善当前人民生活直接相矛盾的事情。其实，这是不对的，不全面的。积累基金包括两个部分：一部分也是主要的部分，是生产性的积累，如新建的工厂、矿山、水库、铁路，新增加的机器、设备、生产用原材料、燃料，等等；一部分是消费性的积累，如新建的学校、医院、住宅、电影院、戏院，新增加的公共交通设备、各种消费品（粮食、棉布、食油、食糖、日用百货等）储备，等等。前者是用于扩大再生产的，后者则是直接用于改善人民当前生活的，是为满足人民的消费需要。因之，在说明积累率高或低以及它与当前人民生活的关系时，必须同时分析积累基金的构成内容。只有这样，才能全面地、确切地说明问题。
    在我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划期间，由于工农业生产几倍几十倍地向上增长，国民收入使用中积累和消费的比例的变化趋势将会怎样，积累所占比重是否有必要继续提高呢？完全必要。刘少奇同志在中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议上所作的工作报告中指出：“在生产发展和人民生活逐步改善的条件下，无论国营经济和集体经济，都应当适当地提高积累在国民收入中的比重，以便更多更快地进行社会主义建设。”经验证明，只有生产性的积累多了，进一步扩大再生产才有可靠的物质保证。
    提高积累在国民收入中的比重，是否可能呢？回答也是肯定的。大家知道，积累的多少和增长的快慢，最基本的是决定于生产。只要生产迅速增长了，国民收入迅速增加了，积累就有可能较多较快地增长。就目前的情况看，今年我国的工业生产增长速度和农业生产增长速度，都将大大超过第一个五年计划期间的任何一年。这样史无前例的生产大跃进的新形势，为进一步增加积累，提高国民收入中的积累比重，提供了巨大的可能性。不仅工业如此，就连过去一向被人认为积累比重只能低的农业，在生产大跃进以后，随着农业生产合作社改变为人民公社，情况也发生了显著变化，也有可能大大增加积累。例如，去年全国农业生产合作社积累的公积金只有三十亿元左右，今年则可能增加两倍三倍以上，将比过去两年积累的公积金总额还要多很多。过去两年中，各地农业生产合作社所提公积金占纯收入的比例，最多只有10％多一点，今年及今后几年，根据部分人民公社的资料估算，公积金占纯收入的比例，有可能提高到30％甚至40％以上。即便如此，农民的生活比过去几年还可以有很大的改善。因之，某些人认为我国人口多，消费就得多，积累就不能多，这是错误的。
    提高国民收入使用中积累所占比重，并不会影响人民生活的改善。我们所说的提高积累比重，降低消费比重，是就全部国民收入分配中的相对比例而言的。由于国民收入总额扩大，消费基金所占比重虽然缩小，但其绝对数仍有显著的增长，并不是减少了消费基金的绝对额来增加积累基金。事实证明，在各种生产事业高速度发展，国民收入高速度增长的情况下，保持积累基金的增长速度快于消费基金的增长速度，仍然可以既保证人民生活不断有显著提高，又能大大增加积累，显著提高积累在国民收入中的比重。例如，假定第一个五年计划期间的国民收入为一百，其中积累基金占二十三，消费基金占七十七；第二个五年计划期间的国民收入增加到三百，其中积累基金所占比重即使提高到40％，消费基金所占比重降为60％，这样，消费基金的绝对额，仍将由七十七增加到一百八十，即增长了130％以上，人民的生活水平仍然可以大大提高。由此可见，只要在生产迅速发展的前提下，对积累比重增大的任何顾虑都是没有根据的。
    国民收入使用中积累和消费的比例及其变化，是有客观规律的。经验证明，积累的多少和增长的快慢，主要决定于生产。只有生产迅速发展，国民收入迅速增加，积累才可能较多较快地增长。同样，也只有生产性的积累多了、快了，进一步扩大再生产才有可靠的物质保证。因之，可以说，积累和生产的关系，是相互促进相辅相成的。我们应当从积极发展生产这一基本点出发，来不断地增加积累，合理安排积累和消费的比例关系。不从积极发展生产方面着眼，单纯从分配方面打主意，机械地、静止地去平衡积累和消费的比例关系，是消极的办法，从而也是错误的。其次决定于消费。在生产发展中，必须保证人民的生活水平逐步有所提高。只注意发展生产、扩大积累，不注意改善人民生活是不对的。但是，由于人民生活改善的要求是无穷尽的，而国民收入的增长是有限的，所以生活改善的速度必须作适当的安排。否则，虽然生产发展了，国民收入增加了，但不注意合理分配，不是根据人民生活逐步提高的原则来安排消费，而是生产大跃进，生活也来个一步登天，那么，积累依然不可能有较多、较快的增长，甚至还有可能降低。这显然是完全违反勤俭建国方针的。
    辩证唯物主义告诉我们，客观事物是发展的，变化的，国民经济发展中的任何一项比例关系，都不是也不可能是固定的，一成不变的。生产在不断跃进，需要也在不断变化，与此相适应国民经济发展中的各项比例关系，包括积累和消费的比例关系，也必将不断发生变化。事实的发展，正如毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的著名讲演中所说的：“在全民所有制经济和集体所有制经济里面，在这两种社会主义经济形式之间，积累和消费的分配问题是一个复杂的问题，也不容易一下子解决得完全合理。……我国每年作一次经济计划，安排积累和消费的适当比例，求得生产和需要之间的平衡。所谓平衡，就是矛盾的暂时的相对的统一。过了一年，就整个说来，这种平衡就被矛盾的斗争所打破了，这种统一就变化了，平衡成为不平衡，统一成为不统一，又需要作第二年的平衡和统一。这就是我们计划经济的优越性。”
    我们必须正视客观上将会长期存在的社会生产和社会需要之间的矛盾，并充分利用我国社会主义计划经济的优越性，经常不断地注意合理安排和调整积累和消费的比例关系；把人民的个人利益和集体利益、目前利益和长远利益有机地结合起来，尽快地把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
