Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Taipei dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles continued his talks with Chiang Kai-shek this morning. At a time when Western news agencies have widely reported serious disagreements in the talks, Chiang Kai-shek Group's "Foreign Ministry" spokesman Jiang Yisheng denied this this morning, saying that he "was unaware of any disagreement." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson already held a press conference yesterday afternoon to deny that disagreements had occurred in the talks.

At the same time, according to the Associated Press, American and Chiang Kai-shek Group figures in Taiwan emphasized this morning that Dulles had clearly stated in his statement upon arriving in Taipei that the U.S.-Chiang talks "were not to reach any new agreement."

Reuters and United Press International dispatches from Taipei last night and early this morning continued to point out that "major disagreements" had emerged in the talks between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek.

According to Reuters, "highly authoritative Kuomintang sources said that Chiang Kai-shek was very uneasy about earlier suggestions from the United States that the strength of the garrisons on the coastal islands of Quemoy and Matsu could be reduced." Chiang Kai-shek also said "some sharply worded words" about the Warsaw talks.

According to United Press International, the "differences are centered on the American proposal to have the Kuomintang make an overall reduction in its troops and the Kuomintang's demand for more weapons from the United States. Well-informed sources said that Dulles asked Chiang Kai-shek to cut the number of his 500,000 troops, which Chiang refused. Dulles then refused to give any affirmative guarantees on Chiang Kai-shek's demand for more weapons." The report also pointed out that yesterday, the Americans "held two press conferences in an attempt to emphasize that the talks were progressing smoothly," but the Kuomintang authorities did not express any opinions. The Kuomintang authorities originally planned to issue a communique after the talks last night, but later "abandoned this plan." According to a Kuomintang figure, "this insistence on remaining silent indicates the disappointment of the Kuomintang."

    蒋杜会谈分歧掩盖不住
    美国人力图散布乐观空气台湾当局欲说还休
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在今天上午同蒋介石继续举行会谈。在西方通讯社已经广泛传出会谈产生严重分歧的时候，蒋介石集团“外交部”发言人江易生今天上午否认这一点，他说，他“不知道有任何分歧”。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊昨天下午已经举行了记者招待会，否认会谈发生分歧。
    同时，据美联社报道，台湾的美国和蒋介石集团人士在今天上午又强调，杜勒斯在到台北时发表的声明里已经清楚说过，这次美蒋会谈“不是要达成任何新的协议”。
    路透社和合众国际社昨夜和今天凌晨从台北发出的消息都继续指出杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈中出现了“重大的分歧”。
    据路透社报道，“非常权威的国民党人士说，蒋介石对美国早些时候提出的意见非常不安，这个意见认为可以减少沿海岛屿金门和马祖驻军的力量”。蒋介石并且对华沙会谈说了“一些措词很尖锐的话”。
    据合众国际社消息说，双方“分歧集中在美国关于要国民党人全面减少军队的建议上和国民党要美国给予更多武器的要求上。消息灵通人士说，杜勒斯要求蒋介石削减他的五十万军队的人数，蒋拒绝了这一点。然后杜勒斯拒绝就蒋介石关于给予更多武器的要求作出任何肯定的保证。”消息并且指出，昨天一天，美国人“举行了两次记者招待会，企图强调指出会谈进展顺利”，但是国民党当局没有表示任何意见。国民党当局原来准备在昨晚会谈后发表一项公报，但是后来又“放弃了这项计划”，据一个国民党人士说，“这种坚持保持沉默的态度表明了国民党人的失望”。
