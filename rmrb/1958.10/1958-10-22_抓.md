Grasp

Xiè Juézaicái

"Grasp four times a year," "Grasp once a month," "Grasp industry with the right hand, grasp agriculture with the left hand," "Grasp the two ends, bring along the middle," "Grasp the key points," "Don't grasp at sesame seeds and lose the watermelon." - Many documents mention "grasping" when discussing work arrangements and methods.

Humans, known as "the most intelligent of all creatures," are primarily so because they have nimble hands that can grasp. A child's "grasping at the first birthday" is the beginning of the combined use of the brain and hands; the brain selects, and the hands act, first grasping this, then grasping that. They won't grasp nothing at all, nor will they grasp everything at once.

We are much more advanced than children "grasping at the first birthday," but sometimes we are not much wiser than children, so there is a need to talk about it.

First, it is necessary to grasp. Some people don't care about anything, going to work and getting off work as usual, drafting and signing as usual, knowing a little about everything, but not delving deeply into anything. Daily efforts are insufficient, and monthly and yearly efforts are still insufficient. This is very undesirable.

Second, grasping must be planned. Grasping the small things and not the big ones; grasping the slow things and not the urgent ones; grasping what should be grasped first later, and grasping what should be grasped later first; or grasping several things at the same time, using strength evenly, and feeling that strength is insufficient everywhere; all of these are bad. However, some comrades' working methods are often like this.

Third, grasp quickly. Now is an era when "one day equals twenty years." What is considered advanced today becomes backward tomorrow. What is upstream here becomes midstream there. New things are constantly happening. If you don't grasp them quickly, then your self-proclaimed new research, your documents, will be said to be calculating last year's almanac. Since it is an old almanac, it is better not to pay attention to it. However, new developments are mostly made on the basis of existing ones. If the existing ones are not clear, how can you guide the work of new developments, or even fail to understand the new work and become an amateur?

Fourth, grasp firmly and thoroughly. Grasping without firmness is equivalent to not grasping; grasping without thoroughness is also equivalent to not grasping. Spending more time and going deeper into the field is firmness; analyzing the causes and consequences of things, determining guiding methods, and being able to modify and supplement them with new factors that arise at any time is thoroughness. If grasping is not firm, it will inevitably not be able to be grasped, like "riding a horse to look at flowers," the flowers are seen, but you don't know whether they are peach or apricot; if grasping is not thorough, it is like scratching an itch through a boot, no matter how hard you grasp, the itchy spot is still not felt. This is the final stage of grasping.

Grasping is not difficult: greatness comes from the ordinary, and everyone can understand the道理 (dàolǐ, principle).

Grasping is also not easy: it requires practicing the ability to think, accumulating some social common sense and business experience, being good at analyzing the various aspects of each thing's connections and contradictions, and being able to make correct judgments without being bound by not very reasonable judgments.

    抓
    谢觉哉
    “一年抓四次”，“一月抓一次”，“右手抓工业，左手抓农业”，“抓两头，带中间”，“抓重点”，“不要抓了芝麻，丢掉西瓜”。——许多文件上讲工作布置和工作方法，都提到“抓”。
    人，称为“万物之灵”，主要是有能抓的灵便的双手。小孩子“抓周”，是脑与手结合运用的开始，脑在选择，手就动作，先抓这，次抓那，他不会一件也不抓，也不会把所有东西一齐抓。
    我们比“抓周”的小孩进步多了，但有时也并不比小孩高明多少，因此还有说一说的必要。
    一、必须抓。有的人甚么都不在乎，照例上班下班，照例起草签字，甚么都知道一些，又甚么都不深入，日计不足，月计岁计仍是不足。这是很不可以的。
    二、要有计划的抓。抓小的不抓大的；抓缓的不抓急的；应先抓的后抓，应后抓的先抓；或几件事同时抓，平均使用力量，处处感到力量不足；这都是不好的。然而有些同志的工作方法，却常常是这样。
    三、要抓得快。现在是“一天等于二十年”的时代，今天认为先进的，到明天就成为落后的了。这里居于上游的，在那里变为中游了。新的事物不断发生，不赶快抓，那你自以为是新的研究，作出文件，人家却说你是在推算去年的历书。既是旧的历书，那就不理它罢了，但是，新的发展大都是在已有的基础上做出的，已有的不清楚，怎能指导新发展的工作，甚至对于新的工作，将不能了解而成为外行。
    四、要抓紧透。抓而不紧，等于不抓；抓而不透，也等于不抓。用的时间多，深入现场多，是紧；分析事物的来因去果，定出指导的方法，并能随着随时发生的新因素而加以修正和补充，是透。抓如不紧，必然抓不起来，“走马看花”，花是看到了，但不知它是桃是杏；抓如不透，等于隔着靴桶抓痒，尽管用力抓，痒处仍没有感觉。这是抓的最后一关。
    抓不是难事：伟大出于平凡，道理人人可懂。
    抓也不是易事：要练习思考能力，要积累一些社会常识和业务经验，要善于分析每一件事的各方面的联系和矛盾，要能正确作出判断而又不拘泥于不甚合理的判断。
