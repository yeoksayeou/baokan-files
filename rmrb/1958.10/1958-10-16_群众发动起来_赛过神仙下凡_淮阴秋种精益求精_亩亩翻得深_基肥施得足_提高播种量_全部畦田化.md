This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 15th (Reporter Jiang Weicai): The Huaiyin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in leading the autumn harvest and planting work, has focused on ideology, timing, and quality. It has mobilized the masses for extensive airing of views and debates, resulting in rapid progress and high quality in the autumn harvest and planting. As of the 9th, all 390,000 mu of early and mid-season wheat, barley, and naked barley fields in the city's rural areas have been deeply plowed to a depth of one chi (foot) or more, 1.5 billion dan of fertilizer have been transported to 300,000 mu of fields, and 200,000 mu of early-season wheat have been sown in five days.

Huaiyin City was newly formed by the merger of the former Qingjiang City and Huaiyin County. This year, the total planting area for wheat, barley, and naked barley is 500,000 mu. At the beginning of the autumn planting season, 100,000 mu of mid-season rice and 150,000 mu of cotton urgently needed to be harvested, and 330,000 mu of late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes, carrots, and late-season rice needed late-stage field management. Based on this situation, the Huaiyin Municipal Committee, in addition to tightly grasping industrial production, especially steel production, decided to use 100,000 laborers to rush-harvest mid-season rice and cotton and manage late autumn crops, and to use 100,000 laborers to launch a shock campaign for rush-planting.

Initially, some grassroots cadres and the masses, faced with urgent autumn harvest and planting tasks, high quality requirements, and a perceived shortage of labor, developed a fear of difficulty. Some said, "To ensure timely harvesting, we cannot guarantee timely planting," "To ensure timely planting, we cannot guarantee specifications and quality"; others said, "We only have this many people anyway, we can only take care of one end or the other," "Even if immortals descended to earth, they wouldn't be able to do it in time." These people attempted to ease the labor shortage by lowering specifications and quality or slowing down the autumn planting speed.

After discovering these ideological issues, the Huaiyin Municipal Committee immediately launched cadres and the masses in a large-scale airing of views and debates targeting the above-mentioned ideas. The central question of the debate was: how to complete the autumn harvest and planting in a timely manner while ensuring the specifications and quality of the autumn planting? What methods should be used to solve the labor shortage? In the airing of views and debates, methods such as presenting ideas, presenting facts, and presenting detailed accounts were widely used. Commune members of the Yugou People's Commune identified the reasons for this year's low wheat yield during the debate. They believed that there were four omissions in last year's autumn planting: first, omission of deep plowing, only plowing to a depth of four or five cun (inches); second, omission of base fertilizer, only applying ten or so dan of base fertilizer per mu; third, omission of seeding rate, only fifteen jin (pounds) of seeds per mu for sandy soil, and only seven or eight jin for silty soil; fourth, omission of the season, with planting delayed until after the frost. After calculating this account, the cadres and the masses suddenly became enlightened. Through airing of views and debates, cadres and the masses in the city's rural areas recognized the importance of completing the autumn planting in a timely manner and ensuring specifications and quality, further boosting their revolutionary zeal, and labor efficiency generally increased by 30%.

While helping cadres and the masses overcome their fear of difficulty, the Huaiyin Municipal Committee also mobilized the masses to discuss specific methods to solve the labor shortage. In addition to mobilizing cadres of organs, family members of cadres, family members of workers, keepers, watermen, and citizens to participate in the autumn harvest and planting, and vigorously running public canteens and nurseries, etc., to excavate 20,000 laborers, the city also adopted the following five measures to solve the labor shortage: First, give full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, unify the deployment and use of labor, and organize large-scale corps operations. A total of more than 400 field corps were organized throughout the city, camping in the fields to carry out harvesting, fertilizer transportation, deep plowing of land, and sowing. The five-determination method of determining people, time, work, quality, and quantity was also adopted to give play to the enthusiasm of the masses. After adopting large-scale corps operations and implementing the five-determination method, the San Shu People's Commune, with 10,000 laborers, completed the deep plowing, fertilization, and sowing tasks for 10,000 mu of early-season wheat in only four days. Second, differentiate between urgency and carry out shock campaigns. For example, in order to ensure that each mu of base fertilizer reached 5,000 dan, the city organized 100,000 laborers from September 20th to 30th to launch a shock campaign to transport 1.5 billion dan of fertilizer to 300,000 mu of fields. At the same time, according to the soil characteristics of silty land that are "dry for three days, muddy for three days, and can be planted neither dry nor muddy for three days," 40,000 laborers were transferred from various sandy soil areas to support the silty soil areas, and a shock campaign was launched to complete the sowing task of 120,000 mu of early-season silty land. Third, rationally arrange labor to closely integrate the autumn harvest with autumn planting. For example, taking fine work during the day--harvesting, sowing, picking cotton, and fertilizing sweet potato fields, etc., and coarse work at night--threshing rice, deep plowing of land, and transporting fertilizer, etc., to achieve harvesting one piece, plowing one piece, fertilizing one piece, and sowing one piece. Fourth, vigorously reform tools to improve labor efficiency. According to incomplete statistics, the city has reformed more than 32,000 transportation tools, increasing work efficiency by more than one time. Fifth, leadership methods are militarized, universally achieving seven points in the fields: commanders in the fields, propaganda and mobilization in the fields, lodging in the fields, medical care in the fields, telephones in the fields, material supply in the fields, agricultural tool repair in the fields, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses.

Because ideological and political work has been done well and labor has been comprehensively arranged, the quality of this year's autumn planting in the city's rural areas is better than any previous year. Deep plowing has reached one chi (foot) or more, satellite fields have generally reached about three chi (feet), the seeding rate per mu is more than 25 jin (pounds), the base fertilizer per mu has reached 4,000 to 5,000 dan, and all have achieved kitchen garden-style and ridged fields.

### 群众发动起来　赛过神仙下凡  淮阴秋种精益求精  亩亩翻得深　基肥施得足　提高播种量　全部畦田化

    群众发动起来　赛过神仙下凡
    淮阴秋种精益求精
    亩亩翻得深　基肥施得足　提高播种量　全部畦田化
    本报南京15日电　记者姜韦才报道：中共江苏省淮阴市委在领导秋收秋种工作中，抓思想、抓时机、抓质量，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，使秋收秋种做得又快，质量又好。截至9日止，全市农村区三十九万亩早、中茬小麦和元、大麦田全部深翻一尺以上，向三十万亩田运送了十五亿担肥料，并且在五天中播种了二十万亩早茬麦。
    淮阴市是原清江市与淮阴县两个单位新近合并成立的。今年小麦和元、大麦播种面积共为五十万亩。在秋种开始时，十万亩中稻和十五万亩棉花急待收获，三十三万亩山芋、葫萝卜、晚稻等晚秋作物需要进行后期田间管理。淮阴市委根据这个情况，除了紧紧抓住工业生产，特别是钢铁生产外，决定以十万个劳动力抢收中稻、棉花和管理晚秋作物，以十万个劳动力突击抢种。
    开始，部分基层干部和群众在秋收秋种任务急迫、规格质量要求又高、而劳动力又感到紧张的情况下，产生了畏难情绪。有人说：“要保证及时抢收，就不能保证及时播种”，“要保证及时播种，就不能保证规格质量”；还有人说，“横竖就这么多人，两头只能顾一头”，“就是神仙下凡也来不及”。这些人企图以降低规格质量或者放慢秋种速度来缓和劳动力紧张状况。
    淮阴市委发现这些思想情况以后，立即发动了干部和群众针对上述思想大鸣大放大辩论。辩论的中心问题是：怎样做到既能及时完成秋收秋种，又能保证秋种的规格质量？用什么办法解决劳动力紧张？在鸣放辩论中，普遍运用了摆思想、摆事实、摆细账等办法。渔沟人民公社社员在辩论中找出了今年小麦产量不高的原因。他们认为去年秋种有四个漏：一是漏了深翻，只耕四、五寸深；二是漏了基肥，每亩下基肥只十来担；三是漏了播种量，沙土地每亩下种十五斤，淤土地每亩下种只有七、八斤；四是漏了季节，种播都拖迟到霜降以后。这样一算账，干部和群众思想就豁然开朗了。全市农村区干部和群众，就这样经过鸣放辩论，认识到及时完成秋种和保证规格质量的重要性，更鼓足了革命干劲，劳动效率普遍提高了30％。
    淮阴市委在帮助干部群众克服畏难思想的同时，又发动群众讨论解决劳动力紧张问题的具体办法。全市从除了发动机关干部、干部家属、工人家属、饲养员、看水员、市民参加秋收秋种和大办公共食堂、托儿所等，挖掘出二万个劳动力外，又采取了以下五项解决劳动力紧张问题的办法：一、充分发挥人民公社的优越性，统一调度和使用劳力，组织大兵团作战。全市共组织了四百多个野战兵团，在田头安营扎寨，进行抢收、运送肥料、深翻土地和播种等工作。还采取定人、定时、定工、定质、定量的五定办法，发挥群众的劳动积极性。三树人民公社在采取大兵团作战和实行五定办法后，全公社一万个劳动力，仅四天时间就完成了一万亩早茬麦的深翻、运肥和播种任务。二、分别缓急，进行突击。例如为了保证每亩基肥达到五千担，全市从9月20日至30日，组织了十万个劳动力，突击向三十万亩田中运送了十五亿担肥料。同时，根据淤土地“干三天，滥三天，不干不滥种三天”的怕干怕滥的土质特点，从各个沙土地区抽调了四万个劳力支援淤土地区，突击完成了十二万亩早茬淤土地的播种任务。三、合理安排劳动力，使秋收与秋种紧密结合。如采取白天干细活——收割、播种、拾棉花和山芋田的施肥等，晚间干粗活——甩稻、深翻土地和运送肥料等，做到收一块、翻一块、运肥一块、播种一块。四、大力改革工具，提高劳动效率。据不完全统计，全市共改革运输工具三万二千多件，提高工效一倍以上。五、领导方法战斗化，普遍做到七上田：指挥上田、宣传鼓动上田、住宿上田、医疗上田、电话上田、物资供应上田、农具修配上田、大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。
    由于做好了思想政治工作和全面地安排了劳动力，全市农村区今年的秋种质量都比以往任何一年好。深翻都达到一尺以上，卫星田普遍达到三尺左右，每亩播种量都在二十五斤以上，每亩基肥都达到四千担到五千担，并且全部做到菜园化和畦田化。（附图片）
