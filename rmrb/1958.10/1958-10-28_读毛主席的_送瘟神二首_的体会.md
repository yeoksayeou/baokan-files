Thoughts on Reading Chairman Mao's "Farewell to the God of Plague - Two Poems"
    Wu Tianshi

Recently, Chairman Mao published "Farewell to the God of Plague - Two Poems." Chairman Mao's poems are the supreme embodiment of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, unmatched by any poet past or present, Chinese or foreign. Therefore, it is impossible to explain them clearly using the method of annotating old poetry. Here, I write down my personal preliminary understanding for comrades to study. Due to my limited level, there may be errors, and I hope to receive corrections.

The general meaning of the first poem:

Our motherland has green waters and green mountains everywhere, but in the past, schistosomiasis, like a plague god, harmed the health of the people. The harm of schistosomiasis was so great that even the famous ancient doctor Hua Tuo had no way to deal with it. For many years, a tragic fate shrouded the land of our motherland.

What kind of situation was it?

Thousands of villages and fields were abandoned, covered in weeds and wild smoke; the people were emaciated and weak, unable to cultivate the land due to illness;

Tens of thousands of families were infected with this disease, and once infected, the mortality rate was very high, leading to desolation everywhere. Only ghosts triumphantly sang at night.

How vast was the area where schistosomiasis spread!

We traveled eighty thousand miles on land from south to north, and still we were in the area where schistosomiasis was prevalent, seeing schistosomiasis wreaking havoc everywhere;

We flew into the sky to inspect, from east to west, looking at thousands of rivers, and we only saw schistosomiasis raging everywhere, these rivers becoming breeding grounds for schistosomiasis.

The plague god was rampant to such an extent!

The Cowherd in the sky wanted to ask about dealing with this plague god, but he, like the masses of people on earth, had no way to deal with this vicious plague god, and could only share their joys and sorrows, watching these tragic days pass year after year like flowing water.

The general meaning of the second poem:

Now the situation is different. China has the Communist Party, and 600 million people have turned over and become masters of the country. Schistosomiasis has been cured, the plague god can no longer show off its power, and it must be completely and cleanly eliminated from the land of our motherland by the people.

Now our motherland is in the bright spring season. In the warm spring breeze, thousands of willows dance in the wind, showing boundless vitality. Six hundred million Chinese people have exerted endless wisdom and strength, each like the ancient sages Yao and Shun, with noble moral qualities. What distinguishes them from the saints of the past is that today's people also possess a noble communist style, daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to act, and are fighting with nature and changing its appearance.

How endless is the wisdom and strength of the people!

In the blooming suburbs of the motherland, red flowers bloom everywhere. The wind blows the flowers down, causing showers of red rain. These red rains turn into waves with the people's will, becoming various beautiful pictures, and the people's hearts also rise with the waves turned by the red rain. The motherland is in the high tide of socialist construction, in an era where "one day equals twenty years."

The people are building water conservancy projects, leading green water to the green mountains, turning high gorges into calm lakes. In the face of the fearless Chinese people, high mountains are bowing their heads and rivers are making way. Now bridges are being built on high mountains, which are sky bridges for people to reach their beautiful ideals and happy roads.

Now, from south to north, from high mountains to great rivers, what kind of situation is it?

Look! The Chinese people are like giants: In agricultural production, wielding silver hoes higher than the sky, they are "calling dragons to plow the smoke and plant Yao grass"; in industrial production, chimneys stand tall everywhere like iron arms. These factories work to shake the heavens and move the earth, even the shadows of the Three Gorges and the Milky Way are shaking.

The plague god that harms the people has no place to hide in China anymore. To avoid being eliminated, it has no choice but to leave China, "of the thirty-six stratagems, running away is the best."

Okay, the plague god wants to leave, so let's send it off. Light up brilliant candles high, happily tie up a paper boat, and burn the paper boat to the boundless sky according to the ancient method of sending ghosts: "Plague god! Get the hell out!"

The above is the general meaning of the two poems.

I believe that these two poems not only describe the elimination of schistosomiasis in New China, but also adopt a contrasting writing method to show the contrast between the new and old China. The first poem describes the tragic fate of the people in old China, and the second poem describes the leaping progress of the people in New China. Chairman Mao said in the preface to the poems that he was "full of thoughts" when writing these two poems, and I believe that we should also "be full of thoughts" when understanding these two poems.

Our country has vast fertile land, providing us with food and clothing; there are large and small mountain ranges across the country, giving us vast forests and storing rich mineral resources; there are many rivers and lakes, giving us the benefits of boats and irrigation; there is a very long coastline, giving us the convenience of communication with overseas ethnic groups. How vast, large, beautiful, and lovely our motherland is! But since China broke away from the slave system, its economic, political, and cultural development has long been trapped in a state of slow development. Since the Opium War in 1840, imperialism has invaded China, and China has gradually become a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Imperialism stretched out its blood-sucking tubes, sucking the blood and sweat of the Chinese people like demons, and the lives of the Chinese people became an even more tragic picture of bloodstains. I think the first poem of "Farewell to the God of Plague" is about this theme.

Since the founding of New China in 1949, under the leadership of the Communist Party, China has stood up like a giant. From then on, the days of being oppressed, invaded, and slaughtered are gone forever, and the Chinese people have become masters of the country. After achieving a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the political, economic, and ideological fronts, the spirit is even more invigorated, the fighting spirit is even more high-spirited, and the spirit is even more vigorous. The heroic slogan of "fighting hard for three years to fundamentally change the face" has been put forward, awakening the mineral deposits buried underground for hundreds of millions of years, to control floods and overcome natural disasters, so that nature listens to our dispatch and serves us; factories are spreading chimneys throughout the large and small cities of the country, so that the sound of machines is everywhere on the site of all productive labor, and electric lights are sent to every remote mountain village; we are striving to climb the peak of world science and technology, to eliminate poverty and backwardness, so that our people can live the happiest life. The people of the whole country are struggling to build a new socialist China with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. I think the second poem of "Farewell to the God of Plague" is about this theme.

Chairman Mao's two poems were written after reading the People's Daily report on June 30 this year about Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, eliminating schistosomiasis. I think there is a more important meaning in publishing them in early October. We have already driven out the aggressive forces of imperialism from the Chinese mainland nine years ago, but the US imperialism is still colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to occupy our coastal islands and Taiwan and Penghu, and is constantly creating tense situations, attempting to expand its aggression. The Chinese people who have stood up will never allow any demons to continue to harm the Chinese people. We must liberate Kinmen and Matsu, liberate Taiwan and Penghu, this is our internal affair. The aggressive forces of US imperialism must get out of the Taiwan Strait area, "of the thirty-six stratagems, running away is the best." If it insists on not leaving and continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan and conducts war provocations in the Taiwan Strait, then one day, we will eliminate it like we eliminated schistosomiasis! The publication of Chairman Mao's two poems at this time is a great encouragement and unparalleled strength to the Chinese people, who are like giants, waving "silver hoes" and dancing "iron arms," in the struggle for the final expulsion of US imperialism and the recovery of our territory. Chairman Mao said that he was "full of thoughts" when writing these two poems, and I think we should also be so "full of thoughts" when understanding Chairman's poems.

(Editor's note: After Chairman Mao's poems "Farewell to the God of Plague - Two Poems" were published, we received many letters from readers hoping to see explanatory articles, and many newspapers and periodicals have also published some one after another. This article by Comrade Wu Tianshi was originally published in "Masses" magazine. We are now reprinting it for your reference when studying Chairman Mao's poems, and it is not a definitive conclusion.)

    读毛主席的“送瘟神二首”的体会
    吴天石
    最近，毛主席发表了“送瘟神二首”。主席的诗，是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义最高结合的典范，不是任何古今中外的诗人所可比拟的，所以不可能用注释旧诗词的方法注释清楚。在这里，写出我个人初步学习后的一点体会，和同志们研究。因为水平限制，有错误的地方，希望得到指正。
    第一首诗的大意：
    我们祖国到处有绿水青山，但是在过去的时代，因为有血吸虫像瘟神一样地危害人民健康，这种血吸虫为害之烈，即使古代名医华佗也没有办法对付它，多少年来，悲惨的命运就笼罩在祖国的大地上。
    是怎样的一种情景呢？
    成千的村落、田地荒芜了，到处是蔓草荒烟；人民则形消骨立，害了病没有气力去耕种田地；
    上万的人家因为传染了这种病，而且一经传染之后，死亡率很大，弄得到处萧条，到晚来只有鬼在那儿得意地歌唱。
    血吸虫病蔓延的地方你看有多么广阔！
    我们在陆地上自南至北，走八万里的路程，还是在血吸虫病流行的区域，到处看到血吸虫在为害；
    我们飞到天空中巡视，从东到西，看遍千万条河流，也只见血吸虫到处在肆虐，这些河流变成了血吸虫孳生繁殖之地。
    瘟神是猖獗到了这样的地步！
    天上的牛郎想过问一下对付这瘟神的事情，但是他和地上的人民大众一样也没有办法对付这凶恶的瘟神，只能和地上的人民一样同其哀乐，眼看着这悲惨的日子东流水似地一年一年地逝去。
    第二首诗的大意：
    现在的情形不同了，中国有了共产党，六亿人民翻了身，做了国家的主人，血吸虫病治愈了，瘟神不能再逞威风了，要从我们祖国的土地上被人民彻底干净地消灭了。
    现在我们祖国正是处在阳光明媚的大好春天，在和煦的春风中，千条万条的杨柳随风舞弄，表现了无限的生机，六亿中国人民发挥了无穷无尽的智慧和力量，一个个像古代传说中的圣人尧舜一样，有着高尚的道德品质，而和过去圣人不同的，是今天的人民还具有高尚的共产主义风格，敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为，正在和大自然进行搏斗，改变着自然的面貌。
    人民的智慧和力量是怎样地无穷无尽啊！
    在祖国百花灿烂的郊原上，到处开满着红花，风吹花落，下起一阵阵红雨，这些红雨随着人们的心意翻成波浪，变成各种美丽的画图，人们的心潮也随着红雨翻成的浪潮不断高涨。祖国正处在社会主义建设的高潮之中，处在“一天等于二十年”的时代里。
    人们兴修水利，把绿水引上青山，把高峡变成平湖，在无畏的中国人民面前，高山正在低头，河水正在让路。高山上现在架起桥来了，这是人们通向美好理想、幸福道路的天桥。
    现在，从南方到北方，从高山到大河，又是怎样一种情景？
    你看！中国人民像巨人一样：在农业生产上，挥起银锄比天还要高，在那儿“呼龙耕烟种瑶草”；在工业生产上，烟囱到处竖起了铁臂，这些工厂工作起来，真是动天地、泣鬼神，连三峡星河的影子也在动摇。
    危害人民的瘟神在中国再也没有藏身之处了，要免除被消灭的命运，只有离开中国，“三十六着，走为上着”。
    好吧，瘟神要走，就送它走。高高地点起辉煌的明烛，愉快地扎起一只纸船，按照古代送鬼的办法，对着无边无岸的高天把纸船烧掉：“瘟神！滚你的蛋吧！”
    以上是两首诗的大意。
    我以为这两首诗，不单是写的新中国消灭了血吸虫病，而是采取对照的写法，写出了新、旧中国的对照。第一首写旧中国人民悲惨的命运，第二首写新中国人民跃进的情形。毛主席在诗的序言中说，写这两首诗时，“浮想联翩”，我以为我们对这两首诗也要这样来体会。
    我国有广大的肥田沃地，给我们以衣食之源；有纵横全国的大小山脉，给我们生长了广大的森林，贮藏了丰富的矿产；有很多的江河湖泽，给我们以舟楫和灌溉之利；有很长的海岸线，给我们以交通海外各民族的方便。我们的祖国多么辽阔、广大，美丽可爱啊！但是中国自从脱离奴隶制度以后，其经济、政治、文化的发展，就长期地陷在发展迟缓的状态中。自从1840年的鸦片战争以来，帝国主义侵入了中国，中国一步一步地变成了一个半殖民地半封建的社会。帝国主义伸进了它的吸血管，像魔鬼一样地吸吮着中国人民的血汗，中国人民的生活，更变成为一幅血迹斑斑的悲惨图画。送瘟神诗的第一首，我以为是写的这一个主题。
    自从1949年新中国成立，在共产党的领导下，中国像巨人一样地站起来了，从此被压迫、被侵凌、被宰割的日子一去不复返了，中国人民做了国家的主人。在政治战线、经济战线、思想战线上取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利之后，精神更振奋了，斗志更昂扬了，意气更风发了，提出了“苦战三年，根本改变面貌”的英雄口号，正在唤醒埋藏在地下几亿年的矿藏，要驾驭洪水、战胜天灾，让大自然听我们使唤，为我们服务；正在把工厂的烟囱遍布向全国的大小城镇，要使一切生产劳动的场地上都有机器的声音，要把电灯送到每一个深山小村；正在努力攀登世界科学技术的高峰，要消灭贫穷和落后，使我们的人民过最幸福的生活。全国人民正在为建设一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义新中国而奋斗。送瘟神诗的第二首，我以为是写的这一个主题。
    毛主席这两首诗是今年6月30日读了人民日报报道的江西省余江县消灭血吸虫病以后写的。在10月上旬发表，我以为还有更重要的意义。我们已经在九年之前，从中国大陆上把帝国主义的侵略势力赶了出去，但是，美帝国主义还勾结蒋介石集团侵占着我国沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖，而且不断在制造紧张局势，企图扩大侵略。站起来了的中国人民，是绝不允许任何魔鬼继续危害中国人民的，我们一定要解放金门、马祖，解放台湾、澎湖，这是我们的内政。美帝国主义的侵略势力一定要从台湾海峡地区滚出去，“三十六计，走为上计”，如果它一定不走，继续侵占我国的领土台湾，在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅，那末，终有一天，我们就要像消灭血吸虫一样地把它消灭掉！毛主席的这两首诗，在现在发表，这对巨人一样的中国人民正在挥动着“银锄”、舞起了“铁臂”，为最后驱逐美帝国主义，收复我国领土而进行的斗争，是极大的鼓舞，无比的力量。主席讲他写这两首诗时“浮想联翩”，我以为我们体会主席的诗时，也应当这样的“浮想”。
    （编者附记：毛主席的诗“送瘟神二首”发表后，我们收到不少读者来信，希望能看到解释的文章，许多报刊也陆续发表了一些。吴天石同志此文，原载“群众”杂志，我们现在加以转载，是为了供大家在研究毛主席诗时参考，并不是定论。）
