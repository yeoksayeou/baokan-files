Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: A mighty steelmaking army of 700,000 people in Beijing, under conditions of severely insufficient raw material supply and only 40% of production capacity utilized, produced 5,134 tons of steel on the 26th. This figure is equivalent to ten times the average daily output of the city in the first half of October, and more than doubles the previous peak daily output of 1,586 tons, created on the 22nd of this month. Among them, the Beijing Steel Plant, the Special Steel Plant, and the small steel plants of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company produced 1,057 tons of steel; the rest was produced by factories, schools, government agencies, military units, rural communes, and street residents.

Among the people working beside the steelmaking furnaces were employees and teachers and students who gave up their holidays, farmers who had just returned from the fields after putting down their hoes, government ministers, and both "Red Scarves" and "white-haired grandpas." As soon as the night shows were over, the actors hurriedly removed their makeup and rushed over; the salespersons of the stores sent off the last batch of customers, closed the doors of the stores, and came too; mothers lulled their children to sleep, put on headscarves, and left their homes. The steelmaking sites had all kinds of earthen furnaces and earthen blowers, and the "small local groups" exerted great power. The 100,000 residents of Chaoyang District produced 1,008 tons of steel, equivalent to more than 150% of the Beijing Steel Plant's steel production that day. The steel production of other districts all exceeded that of the Special Steel Plant.

In this day's battle to seize steel, people fully demonstrated the noble communist spirit of loving labor, helping each other, forgetting time, and not caring about remuneration. In residential areas such as Lanman Hutong, 80% of housewives voluntarily participated in steelmaking activities. Someone told Zhou Wenrui, who was stir-frying steel, that she had something at home and should go back and take a look. Zhou Wenrui waved her hand and said, "Nothing is more important than steelmaking." At the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, workers' families made steel together with the workers who had just gotten off work; in the steelmaking ranks, there were also retired "February 7th" veteran workers Sun Shuwang and Sun Jiufeng. Yu Kemin, a technician at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, served as a stoker in front of the stir-frying furnace. When she stir-fried steel for the first time, she was timid, closed her eyes, and was afraid that steel sparks would jump into her eyes. Under the guidance of the chief stoker, she boldly used a poker to stir the silver-like molten steel up and down when she stir-fried steel for the second time. The central government agencies also participated in the steelmaking battle together with the people of Beijing. He Changgong, Vice Minister and Party Secretary of the Ministry of Geology, together with the staff of the Ministry of Geology, produced 13.3 tons of steel that day, ranking among the top of the central government agencies. Many teachers, writers, artists, and scientists also produced steel for the country.

Party and state leaders attached great importance to Beijing's steelmaking Sunday. On this day, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai separately inspected the mass steelmaking situation at the Guanghua Timber Factory and the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, respectively. They praised the workers' spirit of engaging in this kind of communist labor. (Attached picture)

    首都钢铁星期日
    城里城外红一片　七十万人大炼钢
    新华社27日讯　北京市七十万人组成的一支强大的炼钢大军，26日在原材料严重供应不足、生产能力只发挥了40％的情况下，炼出了五千一百三十四吨钢。这个数字相当于10月上半月全市平均日产量的十倍，比本月22日创造的日产量一千五百八十六吨的最高纪录陡长两倍多。其中北京钢厂、特殊钢厂和石景山钢铁公司的小钢厂产钢一千零五十七吨，其他都是工厂、学校、机关、部队、农村公社和街道居民炼出的。
    在炼钢炉旁劳动的人群中，有放了假不休息的职工和师生，有刚放下锹镐从田野上回来的农民，有政府的部长，也有“红领巾”和“白发爷爷”。夜戏刚散，演员们匆忙地卸了装赶来了；商店的售货员们送走了最后一批顾客，关上商店的门也来了；母亲们哄睡了自己的孩子，围上头巾离开了家门。炼钢场上有着各式各样的土炉子和土鼓风机，“小土群”发挥了极大的威力。朝阳区十万炼钢居民产钢一千零八吨，等于北京钢厂当天产钢量的150％多。其他各区的钢产量都超过了特殊钢厂。
    人们在这一天的夺钢战斗中，充分发扬了热爱劳动、互相帮助、忘记时间、不计报酬的崇高的共产主义精神。烂缦胡同等居民区80％的家庭妇女自动参加了炼钢活动。有人告诉正在炒钢的周文瑞说，她家里有事让她回去看看。周文瑞摆着手说，“什么事也没炼钢重要”。在长辛店机车车辆厂，职工家属同刚下班的工人们一起炼钢；在炼钢队伍里，还有退休的“二七”老工人孙树旺、孙九峰。协和医院技术员于克敏在炒钢炉前当司炉。她第一次炒钢时胆子小，闭着眼，怕钢花跳进眼睛里。在司炉长的指导下，第二次炒钢时就大胆地用通条把白银似的钢液炒得上下翻腾。中央国家机关也同北京人民一起参加了炼钢战斗。地质部副部长、党组书记何长工，同地质部的工作人员一起，这天炼出了十三点三吨钢，跃居中央国家机关的前列。许多教师、作家、艺术家和科学家们都为国家炼出了钢水。
    党和国家领导人对北京的炼钢星期天很为重视。这一天，朱德副主席和周恩来总理，曾分别到光华木材厂和中共北京市委机关视察了群众炼钢的情形。他们对职工们从事这种共产主义劳动的精神表示称赞。（附图片）
    26日，周恩来总理在北京市委负责同志陪同下，视察了北京市大炼钢铁的情况，并对深夜苦战的钢铁战士致以亲切的慰问。这是周总理在劳动。                           新华社记者　郑震孙摄
