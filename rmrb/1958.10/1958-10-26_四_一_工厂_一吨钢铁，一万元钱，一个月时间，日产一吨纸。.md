    Four "One" Factory
    One ton of steel, 10,000 yuan, one month, daily production of one ton of paper.
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Huixian
    The "Red Flag Paper Mill," built from scratch by students of the Statistics Department of the Renmin University of China, is known as the Four "One" Factory. The Four "One"s are: only one ton of steel was used; just over 10,000 yuan was spent; the factory was built in one month (twenty-five days); and it produces one ton of paper per day.
    This factory is located on the campus of the Renmin University of China. The entire factory has four workshops: raw materials, cooking, papermaking, and gas production. All are sheds and factory buildings built with wooden strips and mud. Around a small shed are stacks of straw. Inside the shed is an ordinary grass cutter for livestock, which is the raw material workshop. The shredded grass is transported to the cooking workshop. The equipment here, such as the cooking pot, washing pool, mixing pool, and settling basin, are all made of brick, pottery, and concrete. On the platform are two stone mills used for rice milling, which replace the "steel blade beater" to uniformly grind the pulp. The produced pulp flows automatically through pipes into a wooden gas-heated cylinder paper machine in the papermaking workshop. This machine functions the same as the steel-made foreign paper machines in large paper mills. The machine operates rhythmically, and white glazed paper comes out of the tail end of the paper machine and is rolled onto a paper roll. Except for the heating cylinder and main shaft, which are made of steel, all the parts of this paper machine, such as the cylinder cage, felt roller, and idler roller, are made of wood. However, the glazed paper rolled on the paper roll is so white and uniform, just slightly thicker.
    When we entered the gas workshop, Liu Heqian, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the department and the director of the factory, pointed to the gas generator and said, "This gas generator is a great creation. It is an important part of the gas-heated cylinder paper machine. It solves the key problem of the papermaking industry going up to the mountains and down to the countryside." Except for the furnace cover, furnace door, and grate, which are made of iron, the rest of this furnace is made of red bricks and mortar. The coarse filter and fine filter of the purification section are made of earthenware pipes. The gas storage tank is made of large earthenware jars, the air duct is made of galvanized iron sheet, and the explosion-proof device is made of kerosene barrels filled with water. This simple gas furnace replaces the complex steam boiler made of steel. Its advantage is not only that it saves steel, but more importantly, it can be universally made in rural areas.
    After visiting the factory, Liu Heqian described in detail to me how more than 300 students from the Statistics Department, with the support of the Party, used their 300 pairs of hands to build this paper mill self-reliantly and from scratch.
    In July, the students wanted to build a decent paper mill. How to build the factory? The students inquired everywhere. According to the factory construction information they found, building even the smallest paper mill would require at least 30 tons of steel and an investment of more than 100,000 yuan. Initially, department head Qi Lumin and Liu Heqian led the students to Mentougou to find iron ore, attempting to mine the ore and exchange it for steel from the steel mill. Students were sent to Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places to find machines. Despite climbing over mountains and ridges in the scorching heat, the iron ore was finally found, but there was not even a small road on this mountain, and there was no way to transport the mined ore. This told everyone that the route of "building a factory with steel" could not be reached for the time being. They decided to ask the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry for help and create a paper mill that used little or no steel through self-reliance. This proposal was supported by the leaders of the Paper Industry Bureau, and engineering and technical personnel were sent to help with the design.
    Teachers and students competed to sign up to participate in the factory construction. Everyone took out their savings to contribute to the factory's construction funds. The students and technical personnel quickly researched and designed a fast and economical paper mill plan. In order to complete the factory as soon as possible, the students did not waste a single second to find materials and tools at various construction sites.
    No one knew how to make machines. What to do? Everyone discussed a solution: "The Dragon King's son can swim," meaning that whoever's father did what, they would do that. Thus, Li Zhuyan signed up as a blacksmith, Gong Fengbao and Huang Guoan became carpenters, and Liu Shixiong became a lathe operator. Seeing the students' soaring enthusiasm, an engineer said, "Living with you makes me feel young again." Engineering and technical personnel also worked alongside the students, providing them with a lot of help. Some visitors also lent a hand. In this way, the construction of the factory building and the manufacture of the machines were all completed in just twenty-five days. Compared with the "21" model paper mill that produces two tons per day, the steel consumption of this factory is only one thirty-fifth, and the investment is only one-tenth.
    The factory has now started operation. The students spend half their time in class and half their time taking turns participating in production here.

    四“一”工厂
    一吨钢铁，一万元钱，一个月时间，日产一吨纸。
    本报记者　张慧贤
    中国人民大学统计系学生们白手起家建成的“红旗造纸厂”，号称四“一”工厂。四“一”是：只用了一吨钢铁；一万多块钱；一个月建厂（二十五天）；日产一吨纸。
    这座工厂座落在中国人民大学校园里，全厂有原料、蒸煮、造纸、煤汽等四个车间，都是用木条、泥土搭抹起来的棚子和厂房。一个小棚子周围堆满了一垛垛的稻草。棚子里面有一台给牲畜切草的普通切草机，这就是原料车间。切碎了的草运到蒸煮车间。这里的设备如蒸煮锅、洗涤池、搅拌池、沉砂盘等全部都是用砖、陶、混凝土制成的。平台上还有两个碾米用的石碾，它是用来代替“钢刀打浆机”把纸浆碾匀。制出的纸浆，通过管道自动流入造纸车间一台木制煤汽烘缸造纸机内。这个机器和大造纸厂钢铁制成的洋造纸机的作用一样。机器在有节奏地运转着，白色的有光纸从造纸机的尾端出来被卷在纸辊上。这台造纸机，除了烘缸和主轴是用钢铁制成的以外，圆纲笼、毛布辊、托辊等全部零件都是木制的，但是卷在卷纸辊上的有光纸却是那么洁白均匀，只是稍厚些。
    当我们走进煤汽车间时，这个系的共青团总支书记、这个厂的厂长刘鹤谦指着煤汽发生炉说：“这个煤汽发生炉可是个大创造，它是煤汽烘缸造纸机的重要组成部分，它解决了造纸工业上山下乡的关键问题。”这个炉子除炉盖、炉门、炉篦是用铁制的以外，其它全是用红砖和灰砂浆砌成的。净化部分的粗滤器和细滤器是用缸瓦管组成的，贮汽罐用的是大瓦缸，风道用的是白铁皮，防爆器是用煤油桶装水制成的。就是这么简单的煤汽炉，就代替了钢铁制造的复杂的蒸汽锅炉。它的好处不仅是节省了钢材，更重要的是农村可以普遍制作。
    看了工厂以后，刘鹤谦详细地向我介绍了统计系三百多个同学在党的支持下，如何用他们三百双手，自力更生、白手起家建设这个纸厂的情景。
    7月间，同学们想办一个像样的造纸厂。工厂怎么办呢？学生们到处打听，从找到的建厂资料看，办一个最小型的造纸厂至少也需要用三十多吨钢铁和十几万元的投资。开始，系主任祁鲁明和刘鹤谦带着学生到门头沟去找铁矿，企图开采矿石向钢铁厂换钢铁。同学派人到天津、唐山等地去找机器。大伏天爬山越岭，铁矿总算找到了，但是这个山上连一条小路都没有，开采了铁矿也没办法运出来。这告诉大家走“钢铁建厂”的路线一时是走不到头的。他们就决定请轻工业部造纸局帮助，自力更生创建一个不用或少用钢铁的造纸厂。这个提议得到了造纸局领导上的支持，并派了工程技术人员来帮助设计。
    师生们争先报名参加建厂工作。每个人都把自己的积蓄拿出来做建厂资金。学生们和技术人员很快就研究、设计出了一个又快、又省的造纸厂的方案。为了工厂早日建成，同学们不放过一分一秒时间，到各工地去找材料、找工具。
    没有一个人会造机器，怎么办呢？大家商量了一个“龙王爷的儿子会浮水”的办法，看谁的父亲是干什么的，就叫他干什么。这样，李著彦就报名当了锻工，贡冯宝、黄国安就当了木工，刘世雄当了车工。看到学生的冲天干劲，一个工程师说：“同你们生活在一起，使我恢复了青春。”工程技术人员也和学生一起干起活来，给了学生们不少帮助。有的来参观的人，也下手帮他们干活。这样，厂房建设和机器制造，只用了二十五天就全部完成了。这个厂同日产两吨的“21”型造纸厂比较，钢铁用量仅为三十五分之一，投资仅为十分之一。
    现在工厂已经开工了。学生们半天上课，半天在这里轮流参加生产。
