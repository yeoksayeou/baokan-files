    Zhao Zhongde Didn't Back Down
    In the disabled veterans' sanatorium, whenever Zhao Zhongde is mentioned, everyone praises him as an outstanding pig farmer.
    Zhao Zhongde is an old soldier with twenty years of military life, and is fifty-seven years old this year. After he retired and came to the sanatorium, he eagerly requested to participate in production. He said, "Although I am old, my heart is not old. I want to contribute my share of energy." This spring, when the sanatorium launched a large-scale agricultural and sideline production campaign, Zhao Zhongde was the first to sign up and took the lead in raising nine pigs. When this news spread, some people said: "He's so old and still feeding pigs! Just wait to eat dead pork."
    Since becoming a feeder, Zhao Zhongde has been working tirelessly day and night. At that time, grass was not available in the fields, so he carried a basket to the family compound and canteen to collect rotten vegetable leaves to cook for the pigs. Every time he fed the pigs, he stood by and watched, afraid that the pigs would not be full. However, because he had no experience in feeding pigs at first, the pigs became thinner and thinner. Soon, some developed ringworm, some fell ill, and two died in succession. Zhao Zhongde felt very sad. Some kind-hearted people advised him, "Forget it, let someone else feed them. You're so old, you should rest for a few days, why bother?" However, Zhao Zhongde did not back down. He thought, "The reason why I didn't raise the pigs well is because my skills are not high. As a Communist Party member, I must not bow my head to difficulties. I will overcome this difficulty."
    From then on, Zhao Zhongde actively studied pig raising techniques, bought reference books, and went to nearby agricultural cooperatives to learn experience. Once, he heard that the Xinxiang City Food Company was holding a battlefield conference on pig raising, so he quietly ran to participate. At the conference, he learned how to ferment green grass and process cow dung to feed pigs. After testing, the effect was very good. He was extremely happy, and every day he pulled a cart to dig cow dung and cut green grass to cook for the pigs. At the same time, he also asked comrades from the city's epidemic prevention station to treat the pigs' ringworm. In less than a few months, the ringworm was cured, the sows were pregnant, and all of them were fat and strong. In August of this year, he was named a pig-raising model by the city's military service bureau.

    赵忠德没打退堂鼓
    在残废军人教养院里，人们一提到赵忠德，大家都异口同声称赞他是个出色的养猪能手。
    赵忠德是一个有着二十年戎马生活的老战士，今年五十七岁。他退休来到教养院后，迫切地要求参加生产，他说，我虽然年老了，但我的心不老，我要有一分热，发一分光。今年春天，教养院开展农、副业大生产时，赵忠德首先报名参加，带头养了九只猪。这一消息传出后，有的说：“这样大的年纪还喂猪哩！等着吃死猪肉吧。”
    赵忠德自担任饲养员后，整天废寝忘食地劳动着。当时地里割不着草，他就担着筐子到家属院和食堂里收集烂菜叶，给猪煮食。每次喂猪时，他都站在旁边看，唯恐猪吃不饱。可是，由于一开始他没有喂猪经验，猪越喂越瘦，不久，有的生了癣，有的病倒，接连死了两头。赵忠德心里非常难过，有些好心肠的人们劝他说：“算了吧，叫别人去喂吧，你这样大年纪的人，该休息几天了，何必自找麻烦呢。”但是，赵忠德并没有打退堂鼓，他想，猪没有喂好是我的技术不高，作为一个共产党员，决不能向困难低头，我要打破这个难关。
    从此以后，赵忠德就积极学习养猪技术，买参考书籍，到附近农业社里去学习经验。有一次，他听说新乡市食品公司召开养猪战地会议，他就悄悄地跑去参加。在大会上，他学会了青草发酵和牛粪加工的喂猪方法后，经过试验，效果很好。他可高兴极了，每天拉着小车出去挖牛粪割青草，给猪煮食。同时，还请了市防疫站的同志给猪治癣。不到几个月的时间，癣也治好了，母猪也怀了孕，个个都吃得肥头大耳，腿粗腰圆。在今年8月，他被市兵役局评为养猪模范。
