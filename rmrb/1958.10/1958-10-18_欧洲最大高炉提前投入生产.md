    Europe's Largest Blast Furnace Put Into Production Ahead of Schedule

    A new blast furnace at the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant in the Urals was put into production on the 15th, two and a half months ahead of schedule. In terms of production capacity, this blast furnace is even larger than the largest European blast furnace recently put into production in Krivoy Rog in the Soviet Union.

    This large blast furnace was built by Soviet Communist Youth League members, and it only took nine months from commencement to completion.

    American metallurgical workers who visited this project at the end of May were very surprised to learn that this blast furnace would be ignited before November 7th ahead of schedule. But later, the Soviet youth builders moved the original date forward by another month, and on October 7th this huge blast furnace began furnace baking.

    The entire ironmaking process of this new blast furnace is automatically controlled. The blast furnace is equipped with an economical steam cooling system, which was pioneered by Soviet engineers in the world. (Attached picture)

    欧洲最大高炉提前投入生产
    乌拉尔车里雅宾斯克冶金工厂的一座新高炉在15日提前两个半月投入生产。按生产能力来说，这座高炉比不久前在苏联的克里沃罗格投入生产的欧洲最大的高炉还大。
    这座大高炉是由苏联共青团员建筑的，从动工到建成只用了九个月的时间。
    今年5月底访问过这个工程的美国冶金工作者在知道了这座高炉将提前在11月7日以前点火时感到十分惊奇。但后来苏联的青年建设者们又把原来的日期提前了一个月，10月7日这座特大的高炉就开始烘炉了。
    这座新高炉的全部炼铁过程都是自动化操纵的。高炉装备有经济的蒸汽冷却系统，这种冷却系统是苏联工程师在世界上首创的。（附图片）
