Xinhua News Agency, October 29th. Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, held a banquet this evening to bid farewell to the entire Bulgarian Parliamentary Delegation, which is about to conclude its visit to China.

Vice Chairman Peng Zhen said at the banquet that the visit of the Bulgarian Parliamentary Delegation to China is a major event in the ever-developing friendly relations between China and Bulgaria. This visit has further deepened the mutual understanding and brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Bulgaria.

Peng Zhen said that both China and Bulgaria are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. The entire socialist camp is leaping forward in socialist and communist construction at a speed that capitalist countries cannot match. The socialist camp is like the rising sun, thriving and prosperous. In contrast, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is nearing its end, like the setting sun. However, imperialism is by no means willing to withdraw from the stage of history automatically and is stepping up the creation of tense situations and pursuing a policy of aggression. It continues to carry out military provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait, attempting to expand its aggression against China, and is playing the trick of "ceasefire" and creating "two Chinas," attempting to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu for a long time and interfere in China's internal affairs. But the era of imperialism running rampant over the Chinese people is over. The Chinese people, who have stood up, are determined and confident in recovering their territory of Taiwan, which cannot be shaken by any force, and the United States is not allowed to interfere in its own affairs in the slightest. All aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism will only tighten the noose around its neck and hasten its own demise.

Peng Zhen asked the delegation to convey the profound friendship of the Chinese people to the fraternal Bulgarian people. He proposed a toast to the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples, and to the great unity of the countries of the socialist camp!

In his speech, Chairman Chervenkov praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in the great leap forward of socialist construction. He said, "We must admit that we did not expect to see such an unprecedented production upsurge in your country, to see such a large-scale, energetic, numerous, confident, and powerful unprecedented production upsurge. This upsurge is growing, expanding, and deepening not every day, but every hour."

Chervenkov said that the Chinese people, with infinite confidence in the truth of communism, are unprecedentedly united around the Communist Party, determined to make any sacrifices, work hard, and accept tests in order to complete the Party's instructions. The infinite trust of 650 million people in the Party is an extraordinary force, a force that can create miracles and defeat any enemy.

Chervenkov said that Taiwan and other islands, Chinese territory currently occupied by U.S. imperialists, must return to the embrace of their motherland. Imperialism has miscalculated, and its future is not bright. No matter how rampant the various Dulleses are in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere, tomorrow does not belong to them. Their deeds are doomed to failure. Our cause—the cause of peace and socialism—will surely triumph.

Chervenkov emphasized the growing strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and the great role it plays in defending world peace and promoting the economic development of socialist countries.

Chervenkov finally raised his glass to wish the friendship between Bulgaria and China to grow and strengthen, and the common eternal friendship between Bulgaria, China, and the Soviet Union to grow and strengthen. Bulgarian Ambassador to China Panchevski and his wife were invited to attend the banquet tonight.

Li Jishen and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council, Luo Guibo, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and heads of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and relevant departments attended the banquet tonight.

    彭真副委员长举行宴会
    欢送保加利亚议会代表团
    新华社29日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、北京市市长彭真今天晚间举行宴会，欢送即将结束在我国访问的保加利亚议会代表团全体人员。
    彭真副委员长在宴会上讲话说，保加利亚议会代表团来我国访问是中保两国日益发展的友好关系中的大事。通过这次访问进一步加深了中保两国人民的相互了解和兄弟友谊。
    彭真说，中保两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员。整个社会主义阵营都在以资本主义国家不能比拟的速度飞跃地进行社会主义和共产主义的建设。社会主义阵营有如旭日东升、蒸蒸日上。与此相反，以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在日暮途穷，日落西山。但是帝国主义绝不甘心自动地退出历史舞台，正在加紧制造紧张局势，推行侵略政策。继续在台湾海峡地区对我国进行军事挑衅，企图扩大对我国的侵略，并且玩弄“停火”和制造“两个中国”伎俩，妄图长期霸占我国领土台湾、澎湖。干涉我国内政。可是帝国主义在中国人民头上横行霸道的时代已经过去了。站起来了的中国人民收复自己领土台湾的决心和信心，是没有任何力量可以动摇的，是丝毫都不能允许美国干涉自己的事务的。美帝国主义的一切侵略活动只会把它套在脖子上的绞索越拉越紧，更快地促成自己的灭亡。
    彭真请代表团把中国人民的深厚友谊转达给兄弟的保加利亚人民。提议为中保两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊，为社会主义阵营各国的伟大团结干杯！
    契尔文科夫团长在讲话中赞扬了中国人民在社会主义建设大跃进中所取得的巨大成绩。他说，我们应当承认，我们没有料到在你们国家内能看到这样前所未见的生产高潮，能看到这样规模浩大、干劲冲天、人数众多、信心十足、力量强大的空前的生产高潮。这一高潮不是每天，而是每小时都在增长扩展和深入着。
    契尔文科夫说，中国人民正怀着对共产主义真理的无限信心，空前地团结在共产党的周围，为了完成党的指示而决心作任何牺牲、紧张劳动和接受考验，六亿五千万人民对党的无限信任，这是不平凡的力量，这个力量能够创造奇迹，能够击败任何敌人。
    契尔文科夫说，目前被美帝国主义者所占领的中国领土台湾以及其他岛屿一定要回到他们祖国的怀抱里。帝国主义已经失算了，它的前途是不美妙的。各种各样的杜勒斯在台湾海峡和其他地方不管怎样地猖狂，可是明天是不属于他们的。他们的勾当注定要失败的。我们的事业——和平和社会主义事业一定会胜利。
    契尔文科夫强调指出以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益壮大的力量和团结，对保卫世界和平以及促进各社会主义国家经济发展所起的巨大作用。
    契尔文科夫最后举杯祝保中友谊日益发展和巩固、为中保两国与苏联共同的永恒友谊日益发展和巩固。保加利亚驻华大使潘切夫斯基和夫人等应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
    参加今晚宴会的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、程潜，国务院副总理李富春，外交部副部长罗贵波，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员以及各人民团体、各民主党派和各有关部门的负责人。（附图片）
