Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th: Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong "Jing Bao" published a Taipei dispatch on the 23rd titled "Record of Taipei Opening the Door to Invite Du," which said that two days before Dulles arrived in Taiwan, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department of Taiwan convened a meeting to "review propaganda guidelines, believing that there were many 'stupid' things. First, everyone previously followed the United States in accusing the Chinese Communists of shelling Kinmen as 'aggression.' This really fell into the trap of the American conspiracy of 'two Chinas.' Only wars between countries are 'aggression.' If we follow this tone, in the future, when we (the Taiwan Kuomintang calling themselves) counterattack the mainland, the United States will also accuse us of aggression. Second, regarding what Ike (referring to Eisenhower) said: 'The Chinese Communists' firing is a military expansion of territory,' we also cannot follow him blindly, lest when we want to counterattack the mainland, Ike also says it is a 'military expansion of territory.'"
This Taipei dispatch said that the Taiwan Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department "brought up these two matters for review" because Dulles's purpose in coming to Taiwan was to play the "ceasefire" trick of "whoever fires is the aggressor, whoever is militarily expanding territory" in order to "implement the 'two Chinas' plan."
This dispatch said that a Taiwan official newspaper drafted a headline "Vice President Chen Will Personally Greet Dulles" which was also reprimanded by the Taiwan Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department. The reason was that Chen Cheng was greeting Dulles in his capacity as "Premier of the Executive Yuan" and not as "Vice President." Because "Dulles is just a foreign minister," why should the "Vice President" "stoop to greet him."
This dispatch said that the Taiwan newspapers of the 22nd did not publish photos of Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek together, which made readers "feel very strange" because "in the past, when even a minor American official came, Chiang would personally greet them, shake hands, take photos, and order all newspapers to publish large-format pictures."

### 香港报纸一篇台北通讯揭露内幕  台湾当局满怀怨气“开门揖杜”

    香港报纸一篇台北通讯揭露内幕
    台湾当局满怀怨气“开门揖杜”
    新华社广州25日电　香港消息：香港“晶报”23日以 “台北开门揖杜记”为题刊载了一则台北航讯说，在杜勒斯抵台湾的前两天，台湾国民党中宣部召开了一个会议“检讨宣传方针，认为有许多属于‘蠢材’的事。第一是以前大家跟着美国尾巴指中共炮轰金门是‘侵略’，这实在中了美国执行‘两个中国’阴谋，只有国与国间战争，才是‘侵略’。如照此语气，将来我们（台湾国民党自称）反攻大陆，美国也会指我们侵略了。第二是关于艾克（指艾森豪威尔）所说：‘中共开火，是武力扩张领土’，也不可跟着他乱说，提防我们要反攻大陆时，艾克也说是‘武力扩张领土’。”
    这篇台北航讯说，台湾国民党中宣部“把两事提出来检讨”，是因为杜勒斯到台湾的目的就是要玩弄“谁开火谁就是侵略，谁就是武力扩张领土”的“停火”诡计来“执行‘两个中国’计划”。
    这篇航讯说，台湾一家官方报纸拟了一条“陈副总统明将亲迎杜卿”的标题，也受到台湾国民党中宣部传令训斥。理由是陈诚不是以“副总统”的身份而是以“行政院长”的身份去迎接杜勒斯。因为“杜卿不过是一个外交部长而已”，“副总统”“为什么要卑躬屈节去迎他”。
    这篇航讯说，22日的台湾报纸全都没有把杜勒斯和蒋介石同拍的照片刊出，使读者“深感奇异”，因为“以前美国一个芝麻绿豆小官来了，官来了，蒋必亲迎、握手、拍照，也必传令各报大大制图刊出的”。
