According to the *New Hunan Daily*: The Meitanba Coal Mine in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, implemented the policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale operations, integrating indigenous and foreign methods, and implemented a method of one work zone leading several satellite small coal kilns. A mass movement was launched. In September, the planned coal production was 18,000 tons, but the actual completion was 23,067 tons, exceeding the original plan by 28.1%. This outstanding achievement strongly supported the "steel marshal."

The mine's daily output continuously increased throughout September. The average daily output in early September was 500 tons, and by late September, it reached 860 tons. On September 28th and 29th, two high-yield "satellites" were launched consecutively, with a daily coal production of 2,030 tons, surpassing the output level of the entire month last year, and increasing three times compared to early September; daily coke production was 426 tons, an increase of more than six times compared to early September. High production levels have been maintained recently.

During the high-yield campaign, the Meitanba Coal Mine carried out a large-scale mobilization from top to bottom, launching a vigorous mass movement among more than 3,000 employees. After open discussions and debates, the workers unanimously agreed that without coal and coke, steel cannot be produced; without steel, there would be no prosperity for the motherland and happiness for the people. Everyone was energetic and enthusiastic in the production battle. For example, the Laoshanbian work zone was assigned a task of producing 410 tons of coal on September 29th by the mine headquarters. After mass discussion, it was raised to 453 tons, but they actually produced 514 tons. Worker Liu Dizhu was scheduled to rest on the 28th, but seeing the urgency of the production task, he insisted on not resting, saying: "Even if I have to carry it in the tunnels, I will carry out 2,600 catties of coal." As a result, he transported 3,000 catties of coal from underground that day. In mid-August, there were only more than 1,500 underground workers in the mine, but by the end of September, it had increased to 2,700. These new workers were farmers who had just put down their hoes, lacked technical skills, and lacked knowledge of safe production. Thanks to the mine's adoption of methods such as veteran workers teaching new workers and experienced workers guiding newcomers, the work efficiency of the new workers was rapidly improved.

After the ideological mobilization of the workers, the potential of the equipment was fully exploited through technical innovation. For example, the hoist in No. 1 Well of Laobian Mountain, previously, some people had conservative ideas and dared not fully open the air valve, so it could only lift two buckets every five minutes; now, with the air valve fully opened, it can lift three buckets every five minutes. In addition, due to the shortage of ventilation equipment, the workers created a wooden hydraulic ventilator to solve the underground ventilation problem.

During the high-yield campaign, through ideological mobilization and strengthened organizational management, the workers fully demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation. For example, the supply and marketing departments ensured the supply of materials; the cooks improved the meals; and the health department ensured that there was someone in every well. Cooperation in production has been greatly strengthened compared to before. For example, in terms of hoist lifting, the coordination between workers above and below ground was not good enough in the past, but now they are very proactive, which has improved the efficiency of lifting. The cooperation between the shifts is also very good. The incoming shift always does a good job of preparing for production for the outgoing shift.

All the employees of the Meitanba Coal Mine also proposed to redouble their efforts and strive to achieve a daily output of 4,000 tons of raw coal by mid-October.

    井上井下大辩论　大窑小窑齐心干
    煤炭坝煤产量急升
    超额完成上月计划创日产二千多吨纪录
    据新湖南报消息：湖南省宁乡县煤炭坝煤矿贯彻执行了大中小结合、土洋并举的方针，实行了一个工区带几个卫星小煤窑的办法，开展了群众运动，9月份计划产煤一万八千吨，实际完成了二万三千零六十七吨，超额28.1％完成原订计划，创造了出色的成绩，有力地支援了钢铁元帅。
    这个矿9月份内，日产量不断提高。9月上旬平均日产量五百吨，到下旬平均日产量就达到了八百六十吨。9月28、29日，连续放出了两颗高产“卫星”，日产煤二千零三十吨，超过了去年一个月的产量水平，比9月初提高了三倍；日产焦四百二十六吨，比9月初增加了六倍多。最近仍然保持了高产水平。
    在高产运动中，煤炭坝煤矿，从上到下进行了大规模的动员，在三千多名职工中掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众运动。经过鸣放辩论，职工们一致认为没有煤焦，就生产不出钢铁；没有钢铁，就没有祖国的富强和人民的幸福。在生产战斗中个个都是生龙活虎，干劲冲天。例如老山边工区，矿部下达给他们的任务是9月29日产煤四百一十吨，经过群众讨论提高到了四百五十三吨，实际上他们生产了五百一十四吨。工人刘迪祝28日轮到他休息，他看到生产任务紧张，坚决要求不休息，他说：我到窿洞里去担也要担二千六百斤煤出来。结果他这一天从井下运出了三千斤煤。8月中旬，该矿井下生产的工人还只有一千五百多人，到9月底就增加到了二千七百人，这些新工人都是刚放下锄头的农民，技术不熟练，而且缺乏安全生产知识。由于矿上采取了老工人教新工人、先来的工人带后来的工人等办法，使新工人的工作效率迅速地得到了提高。
    当职工群众的思想充分发动起来以后，通过技术革新，设备的潜力也得到了充分的发挥。如老边山一号井的绞车，从前由于有些人存在保守思想，气阀不敢完全打开，每五分钟只能提升两桶；现在把气阀完全打开，每五分钟就可提升三桶了。又如通风设备少，职工们就创造了一种木质水力抽风机，来解决井下通风问题。
    在高产运动中，通过思想发动和加强组织管理，职工们充分发挥了共产主义协作精神。如供销部门保证材料供应；炊事员搞好伙食；保健部门做到每个井都有人。生产上的协作比以前大大加强。比如在绞车提升方面，过去井上井下的工人配合得不够好，现在彼此都很主动，这样就提高了提升的工效。各班工人之间的协作也很好。上班总替下班做好生产前的准备工作。
    煤炭坝煤矿的全体职工还提出要加倍努力，争取在10月中旬达到日产原煤四千吨。
