　　"Granny Meng, you're seventy years old, with no relatives or family. Hurry up and go to the communal kitchen to eat the 'Five Guarantees' meals!" When the cadres saw Granny Meng, they said this with concern. But Granny Meng always answered like this: "Look how sturdy I am. Just eating without working, others would gossip, and I'd be ashamed!"

　　Granny Meng is considered the oldest female member of the Taipingqiao Production Team in the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai, Beijing. But she is old in years, not in spirit, and her enthusiasm is greater than anyone else's. Every morning, just as the sky is beginning to lighten, she carries her farm tools to the fields, and in the evening, she is often the last one to leave the field. From New Year's Day this year until now, she has never missed a day of work due to illness; she also takes the time to do more than ten days of voluntary labor for the cooperative. Once, her leg hurt, and the doctor, seeing that she was old, told her to rest for a few days, but she only rested for one day and then ran back to work. The team leader wanted her to go back home, but she became so anxious that her face turned red.

　　When Granny Meng works, she never bargains, regardless of whether the work is light or heavy, whether she gets a lot or a little. However, if there is a shortage of people doing heavy work, and the team leader assigns her lighter work, she has objections. Once, there were few people carrying earth to repair the canal, so she put down the light work and ran to carry earth, which made many young men who were tired and wanted to rest feel embarrassed, and they hurried over to replace her. Someone asked her, why work so hard at this old age? She said: "In the past, my family had little land and a shortage of people, lacking this and that, and suffered greatly. Now the Communist Party has arranged everything for us in an orderly way, with someone in charge of production, someone in charge of money, and someone to cook, which is both worry-free and reassuring. If I have strength and don't use it, what am I saving it for?"

    孟大娘不要五保
    “孟大娘，你七十岁的人了，家里没亲没故，赶快到大伙房里去吃五保饭吧！”干部们见了孟大娘，都关切地这样说。可是孟大娘却总是这样回答：“你看我身子骨这么结实，光吃饭不干活，别人不说闲话，我还嫌害臊呢！”
    孟大娘在北京丰台东方红农业社太平桥生产队里，算是年纪最大的一个女社员了。可是她人老心不老，干劲比谁都不小。每天早晨天刚露亮，她就扛着农具往地里走，晚上又常是最后一个离开地头。从今年元旦到现在，她从没有因事缺过一天勤；还抽时间为社里作了十多天的义务劳动。有一次她腿痛，医生看她老了，嘱咐她多休息几天，可是她只休息了一天，就又跑来上工。队长要她回去，她急得脸都发了红。
    孟大娘干活，不管活轻活重，分多分少，从来不讲价钱。可是，如果干重活的人缺，队长再分配她作轻活，她可有意见。有一次，修渠抬土的人手少，她就放下轻活跑去抬土，使得许多干累了想歇歇的小伙子都感到不好意思，赶忙跑来把她换下去。有人问她，这大年纪了，干么这样苦干？她说：“过去我家里地少人缺，短这没那，受了大苦。现在共产党给我们安排的条条是道，有人管生产，有人管钱，有人给做饭，又省心，又踏实。我有劲不使，可留着干么呢？”
