Datong dispatch from our newspaper: A trial using indigenous methods to process potatoes and produce refined starch has recently succeeded in Datong City, Shanxi Province.

Shanxi Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of potatoes this year. The handling of potatoes this year has shifted from primarily eating fresh potatoes to primarily processing them, with grinding starch for comprehensive utilization taking a leading position in processing. More than 20 workers, farmers, cadres, students, and technicians participating in the experiment discovered, during a collective study of the problem of making starch from potatoes, that the indigenous grinding methods used everywhere can only produce coarse starch. Then the national processing departments use coarse starch to process refined starch. This has many processes, wastes time, and is uneconomical. Therefore, they combined the two processing steps into one and analyzed the root cause of the shortcomings of indigenous coarse starch grinding, experimenting with improvements in each production link. First, the potatoes are selected and washed, and the insect-eaten and rotten parts are removed; when grinding the flour, 0.2 degrees of 11% sulfurous acid water is added per ton of potatoes to replace bleaching powder or potassium permanganate, etc., overcoming some of the shortcomings caused by the use of these raw materials, making the starch both white and viscous; after grinding into a slurry and passing through silk, it is washed and precipitated repeatedly to remove sand; attention is paid to dust prevention when drying the starch. The experimental results: the starch moisture meets the standard, and the ash content and spots exceed the standard for first-grade powder, approaching the standard for extra-grade powder, breaking the claim that indigenous methods cannot produce refined starch, and opening up a new path for processing high-grade starch.

This indigenous method of manufacturing refined starch requires less investment, is simple and easy to implement, and is convenient for rural promotion. After calculation, the average processing fee for producing one ton of starch in this way is ten yuan, which is 94% lower than the previous processing fee. The main raw material for making starch with this indigenous method is sulfurous acid. The participants in the experiment also successfully tested the indigenous method of making sulfurous acid water with sulfur, which not only reduced processing costs but also guaranteed the source of raw materials.

    土办法能制精淀粉
    大同为处理马铃薯开辟新路
    本报大同电  一项采用土办法加工山药蛋制造精淀粉的试验，最近在山西省大同市获得成功。
    山西省山药蛋今年获得空前大丰收，今年山药蛋处理由过去以食用鲜薯为主一变而为以加工为主，加工中磨制淀粉综合利用又占着首要地位。参加试验的二十多个工人、农民、干部、学生和技术人员在集体研究山药蛋制淀粉问题中，发现各地通用的土磨制淀粉法只能制粗淀粉，国家加工部门再用粗淀粉加工精淀粉，这样工序繁多、浪费时间，很不经济。因此他们把两道加工手续合而为一，并分析了土磨粗淀粉的缺点根源，从各个生产环节上试验改进。先把山药蛋挑选洗净，把虫蚀、腐烂部分割除；磨粉时每吨山药蛋加零点二度11％的亚硫酸水，代替了漂白粉或高锰酸钾等，克服了使用这些原料产生的一些缺点，使淀粉既洁白又有粘性；磨成浆过绢罗后多洗多沉淀、去砂；淀粉烘干时注意防尘。试验结果：淀粉水份合乎标准，灰分、斑点超过一级粉标准，接近特级粉标准，打破了土办法不能制精淀粉的说法，开辟了一条加工高级淀粉的新路。
    这种制造精淀粉的土办法，投资少、简单易行，便于农村推广。经过计算，这样制粉每吨淀粉平均十元加工费，比过去的加工费降低了94％。用这种土办法制淀粉主要原料是亚硫酸，参加试验人员采用土法用硫磺制亚硫酸水也试验成功，这样不仅降低了加工成本，并保证了原料来源。　　（杨义）
