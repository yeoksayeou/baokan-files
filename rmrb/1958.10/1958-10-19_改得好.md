    A Good Improvement
    Huang Shaojin
    The Miao, Dong, and Yao women of the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County have consciously and voluntarily reformed their ethnic clothing, which was previously detrimental to production, during the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. This is worth strongly advocating in minority areas.
    These ethnic groups' old clothing was cumbersome and inconvenient to wear, and especially from weaving and dyeing to embroidery, women had to spend a long time operating, so a large amount of labor was wasted. If each person makes one new set of clothes each year, the more than 60,000 women in the Great Miao Mountain will spend about two million workdays, which is such a great waste!
    Since the Great Leap Forward, various construction projects have been advancing simultaneously, and the shortage of labor has become a widespread problem. In minority areas, due to the vast land and sparse population, the problem of labor shortage is even more prominent in the struggle to conquer nature. Therefore, unnecessary labor should be saved and used to accelerate socialist construction. The reform of ethnic clothing is not a trivial matter of life, but a reflection of the further liberation of social productive forces. It will powerfully promote the development of productive forces.
    Some people say that clothing reform will change the inherent characteristics of the nation. This is a right-leaning conservative thought. The style of clothing of any nation is a manifestation of people's way of life under certain historical conditions. It will change with the changes in people's production and lifestyle. Minority women, in the past under the relatively backward natural economy, were limited by the level of production. It is natural to spend so much effort making clothing. After liberation, especially after cooperativization and the people's commune, the ownership system in minority areas has changed from individual economy to collective ownership, and productive forces have developed unprecedentedly. The backward economic and cultural outlook is changing rapidly. The old clothing styles that hindered the development of productive forces are gradually reformed and replaced by new clothing styles that are conducive to the development of production. This is inevitable. Of course, the original clothing can still be worn at meetings and study sessions, so that it will not hinder production. The women of all ethnic groups in the Great Miao Mountain have overcome many concerns today, want to change, dare to change, and boldly change. This is a great liberation in thought. This is their new style of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and starting everything from accelerating socialist construction.

    改得好
    黄绍进
    大苗山苗族自治县苗、侗、瑶族妇女，在工农业大跃进中，自觉自愿地改革原来不利于生产的民族服装。这件事在少数民族地区值得大大提倡。
    这些民族旧有的服装，穿戴麻烦而又笨重，特别是从织染到刺绣都要经过妇女们长期的操作，大量的劳动力因而浪费了。如以每人每年添制一套衣服计，大苗山六万多妇女，就要花费约二百万个工，这是多么大的浪费！
    自大跃进以来，各项建设事业齐头并进，劳动力不足已是普遍的问题。在少数民族地区，由于地广人稀，在征服自然的斗争中，劳动力少的问题显得更加突出。因此，就应该把不必要花费的劳动力节省下来，用于加速社会主义建设方面去。民族服装的改革不是一件生活小事，而是体现了社会生产力的进一步解放。它将有力地促进生产力的发展。
    有人说，服装改革就改掉了民族固有的特点。这是一种右倾保守思想。任何民族的服装式样，都是一定历史条件下人们生活方式的一种表现。它会随着人们生产、生活方式的改变而改变。少数民族妇女，在过去那种较为落后的自然经济的条件下，受生产水平的限制。制作服装花费那么多的精力，这是很自然的。解放以后，特别是经过合作化和人民公社化，少数民族地区的所有制已由个体经济改变为集体所有制，生产力空前地发展了，落后的经济文化面貌正在飞跃地改变着。束缚生产力发展的旧有的服装样式，逐渐改革，代之以有利于发展生产的新服装式样，这是必然的。当然原来的服装在开会、学习时仍可穿戴，这样才不会妨碍生产。大苗山各族妇女今天破除了重重顾虑，想改、敢改、大胆地改了，这是思想上的一个大解放。这是他们学先进、赶先进，一切从加速社会主义建设出发的新风格。
