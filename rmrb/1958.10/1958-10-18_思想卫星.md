    Ideological Satellites
    Deng Qiwen
    Our country is currently a country of great satellite launches. In agricultural production, industrial production, science and technology...many satellites have been launched. Our satellites are not yet like the Soviet Union's elder brother's man-made red moons. We don't have satellites in that area yet. However, our people call many of the miracles they have created "satellites."
    All our brothers and friends are overjoyed at our achievements. They feel that these achievements do not only belong to one country or one nation, but to all the people of the world. However, they were not without doubts about these mythical miracles at first, and we cannot say that no one doubts them today. This is not difficult to understand. Because the miracles themselves are so unbelievable, were there not many "wave watchers" and "bean counters" among our own people when faced with the budding and growth of these miracles? It was only when the wave had been watched enough, the accounts were settled, and the things were all there, that they dispelled their doubts and prostrated themselves in admiration.
    Although the facts cannot be denied, the reasons are not all clear. Why can the Chinese people create these miracles first? Why have the Chinese people only now created such miracles?
    The simple answer is: Because we launched ideological satellites before that.
    The first ideological satellite is called "All-People Rectification" No. This is an unprecedented large-scale mass political and ideological revolution that swept away the shackles of capitalism and bourgeois individualism on people, making socialism and communism take command politically, and establishing the communist red flag of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" and "labor without remuneration." The people themselves shouted the resounding slogan "We want politics in command, not money in command." If such a banner were not planted ideologically, the kind of completely selfless labor would not appear, and thus there would be no high yields in agriculture and industry. This precious labor is priceless. If it were really to be paid for, how could mere gold and banknotes be able to repay it? For our people, the supreme honor of communism and the life of beauty already in sight are incomparable to any gold mountain or sea of money.
    The second ideological satellite is called "Ideological Emancipation" No. The mass ideological emancipation movement has made people ideologically plant the banner of dialectical materialism, armed their minds with the theory of continuous revolution, thoroughly shattered the shackles that idealism and metaphysics had created for people's minds, and destroyed slave thinking and superstitious thinking. The great communist style has been established. The people themselves made a summary: "How daring people are, how high the land yields"; "Don't be afraid of not being able to do it, only be afraid of not being able to think of it." People understand that all things in nature must obey people and be used by them. The so-called "moving mountains and overturning seas, calling wind and summoning rain" mysteries have become a reality in our hands. When great thought is combined with great labor, miracles are born, not mysteriously. Our ideological emancipation movement is essentially a mass movement of criticism of the old culture and old science, and a construction movement of the new culture and new science. This is the cultural revolution and technological revolution that we are carrying out vigorously.
    The third ideological satellite is called "Mass Line" No. The Party's mass line, guided by Marxist ideology, is the general program that runs through all mass movements and all aspects of the Party's work. It is also the core of the Party's general line for building socialism. Our great leap forward and great satellite launches in industry, agriculture, culture and science are essentially the result of the masses running industry, agriculture, culture and science under the leadership of the Party, and the result of vigorously carrying out mass movements. If this is collectively called a mass economic construction and cultural construction movement, then the mass political and ideological revolution and ideological emancipation movement under the leadership of the Party can be called a mass ideological construction movement.
    It is this mass and conscious ideological construction movement that has created a great upsurge of communist thought, created a great communist momentum in our country, which permeates and diffuses in all areas of life, promotes the progress of all work, and makes us a country flying the red flag of communism.
    Communist ideological satellites have a more far-reaching and broad significance than all industrial, agricultural, scientific and technological satellites. It is the mother of all "satellites." It is shining globally and illuminating the world!

    思想卫星
    邓启文
    我们的国家，目前是一个大放卫星的国家，农业生产上，工业生产上，科学技术上……都放出了不少卫星。我们这些卫星，还不是苏联老大哥那样的人造红色月亮，关于这方面的卫星，我们现在还没有。但是，我们的人民，把自己创造的许多奇迹都叫作卫星。
    我们所有的兄弟和朋友，都为我们的成就而欢欣鼓舞，他们感受得到，这成就不只属于一个国家，一个民族，而是属于全世界的全体人民。但是，他们对于这神话般的奇迹一开始不是没有怀疑的，今天，也不能说就没有人怀疑了；这并不难理解。因为这奇迹的本身，是那样的难以令人置信，在我们自己人民之中，面对着这奇迹的萌芽、生长，不是也有过许多观潮派、算账派的吗？只是当观潮已足、账也结清，事物俱在，他们这才消除怀疑而五体投地了的。
    事实虽然不容否认，但道理未必全都了然，为什么中国人民能够首创这些奇迹？为什么中国人民目前才创造出这样的奇迹？
    简单地回答就是：由于我们在这之前，先放出了思想卫星。
    第一颗思想卫星叫作“全民整风”号。这是规模空前宏大的群众性的政治思想革命，荡除了资本主义、资产阶级个人主义对人的束缚，使得社会主义和共产主义政治挂了帅，树起了“我为人人，人人为我”“劳动不计报酬”的共产主义红旗，人民自己喊出了“要政治挂帅不要钞票挂帅”的响亮口号。倘不在思想上插起这样的旗子，那种完全忘我的劳动就不会出现，从而也不会有什么农业和工业的高产。这种可贵的劳动是无价之宝，倘真的要计予报酬，岂是区区黄金和钞票所能酬报得了？对于我们的人民来说，共产主义的无尚荣誉和已经在望的生活美景，是任何金山钱海所不能比及的。
    第二颗思想卫星叫“思想解放”号。群众性的思想解放运动，使人们思想上插起了辩证唯物主义的帅旗，用不断革命论武装了自己的头脑，彻底打碎了唯心主义、形而上学给人们思想造成的枷锁，奴隶思想、迷信思想破除了，伟大的共产主义的风格树立了起来。人民自己作了总结：“人有多大胆，地有多高产”；“不怕作不到，只怕想不到”，人们明白了自然万物都要听命于人，供人役使。所谓“移山倒海，呼风唤雨”的玄术，在我们手里变成了现实。伟大的思想同伟大的劳动一结合，奇迹便应手而生，并非玄妙。我们的思想解放运动，实质上就是群众性的对于旧文化、旧科学的批判运动，是新文化、新科学的建设运动。这就是我们正在轰轰烈烈地进行着的文化革命和技术革命。
    第三颗思想卫星叫“群众路线”号。以马克思主义思想作指导的党的群众路线，是贯穿于一切群众运动，一切党的工作方面的总纲，它也是党的建设社会主义总路线的核心。我们在工业、农业、文化科学方面的大跃进，大放卫星，实质上是在党的领导下的群众大办工业、农业、文化科学事业的结果，是大搞群众运动的结果。如果把这总称为群众性的经济建设和文化建设运动，那末在党领导下的群众性的政治思想革命，思想解放运动，就可以称之为群众性的思想建设运动。
    正是这种群众性的自觉地思想建设运动，造成了共产主义思想的大高涨，在我们国家里造成了伟大的共产主义的气势，洋溢弥漫于一切生活领域，推动着一切工作的前进，使我们成为一个飘扬着共产主义红旗的国度。
    共产主义的思想卫星，比一切工业的、农业的、科学技术的卫星，意义更为深远广大，它是产生一切“卫星”的母体，它正在光被全球，照耀世界！
