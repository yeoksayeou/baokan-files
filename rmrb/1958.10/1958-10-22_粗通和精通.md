    Superficial Understanding and Mastery
    Cheng Pu
    Not long ago, this newspaper published a report about how Zhang Qiuxiang, a famous cotton-growing expert, enthusiastically helped her competitor rescue cotton crops affected by pests in a competition (see this newspaper, August 14). Everyone who read this report was moved by Zhang Qiuxiang's noble communist spirit. Now, we have read another report about how she and her cotton-growing team have achieved new significant successes in production. This time, we have learned new things from her creative labor.
    Zhang Qiuxiang and her team created an astonishing high cotton yield record on a piece of Zhuang base land with poor soil quality: four acres and three points of high-yield fields are predicted to yield more than a thousand catties of ginned cotton per mu. If you ask them what the "secret" to growing cotton is, then the only "secret" is that they can proceed from reality and apply various technical measures according to the specific conditions of the land, climate, and crop growth. For example, she understands the dialectics of production, and she is good at using her own and others' experiences.
    Irrigation, fertilization, cultivation, pruning, etc. of cotton fields are all cotton-growing technical measures that every ordinary cotton farmer understands. However, in Zhang Qiuxiang's hands, these technical measures have become a series of infinitely mysterious and lively things. For example, thinning and setting seedlings in cotton fields seems to be a relatively simple task, but when Zhang Qiuxiang does it, she takes great pains to consider various conditions such as the strength of the cotton seedlings, the warmth of the weather, and the height of the ground temperature, and most appropriately determines the timing of thinning and setting seedlings. Zhang Qiuxiang also makes a big deal out of weeding and watering cotton fields: at one stage, she wants to irrigate frequently with shallow irrigation and shallow hoeing; at another stage, she advocates stopping irrigation and deep hoeing, all of which are arranged according to changes in weather, ground temperature, and the needs of cotton development. From this, it can be seen that Zhang Qiuxiang knows both what and why for various technical measures, so she can use various technical measures handily and freely in production.
    It is precisely because of this that Zhang Qiuxiang is not satisfied with her existing experience, and even less is she bound by experience like a narrow-minded empiricist. She constantly uses her brain, pays attention to studying new problems that arise in production, and is not afraid of new things breaking through the circle of old experiences. Seeing that the conditions of land, water conservancy, fertilizer, etc. have changed, she leaves more cotton branches and bolls in order to harvest more cotton. And doing so has caused some new problems in field management (such as difficulty in light transmission and ventilation, etc.), so she studies and seeks solutions to these problems herself, and at the same time, she goes to other places to learn new experiences. Here, she also shows the style of daring to accept new things and constantly moving forward.
    No good yield-increasing measure will take effect by itself. Only when producers and production instructors master these yield-increasing measures skillfully can they give full play to their yield-increasing effects. Water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, varieties, close planting, and field management are all well-known yield-increasing measures; however, due to the different specific methods people use to master and apply these measures, the results obtained will also vary, and sometimes there will even be large differences. Just like cooking, the same is frying, stir-frying, steaming, boiling, braising, and stewing. Ordinary cooks can only make ordinary dishes using these methods, while skilled chefs can make exquisite and delicious delicacies using these cooking methods. The difference here lies in the difference between superficial and mastery, skill and clumsiness. Growing crops is also the same. Water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, plus field management, also have profound knowledge. Now, many of our cadres and peasant activists who are both red and expert can master various technical measures in their positions like Zhang Qiuxiang. However, there are still quite a few cadres and peasant activists who only have a superficial understanding of these technical measures. For these things, they know what but do not fully know why; they know the general idea, but do not know the subtleties; they know what to do in ordinary circumstances, but do not know what to do in another situation. Blindness and empiricism in production have a lot to do with this. These comrades should learn from Zhang Qiuxiang's example and creatively guide production and carry out labor. That is to say, they need to study and practice hard to delve into production, so as to deeply understand the role of various yield-increasing measures and the relationship between them, constantly accept new things in production, and constantly enrich their knowledge of the laws of production. In this way, they can master the production business of their profession. In this way, they can swim freely in the ocean of production.

    粗通和精通
    程浦
    不久以前，本报曾经发表过关于著名植棉能手张秋香在竞赛中如何热情地帮助她的对手抢救受虫害棉花的报道（见8月14日本报），凡是读过这篇报道的人莫不为张秋香的那种崇高的共产主义风格所感动。现在，我们又读到了关于她和她的植棉小组如何在生产中创造了新的重大成就的报道，这一次我们从她那创造性的劳动中又学到了新的东西。
    张秋香和她的小组在一块土质并不好的庄基地上创造了惊人的棉花高产纪录：四亩三分丰产田预测每亩可收皮棉一千几百斤。要问她们栽培棉花有什么“秘诀”的话，那么唯一的“秘诀”就是她们能够从实际出发，根据土地、气候和庄稼生长等具体情况来运用各种技术措施。如懂得生产中的辩证法，她善于运用自己的和别人的经验。
    棉田的灌溉、施肥、中耕、整枝等等，是每一个普通棉农都懂得的植棉技术措施，但是到张秋香手里，这些技术措施却变成了一系列的奥妙无穷、生动活泼的东西。比如棉田的间苗定苗，看来是比较简单的工作，但是张秋香做起来，却要煞费苦心地考虑到棉苗的强弱、天气的冷暖、地温的高低等种种条件，最恰当地确定间苗定苗时间的早晚。棉田的除草和灌水，张秋香做起来也大有文章：一个时期她要勤浇浅灌浅锄；另一个时期她又主张停灌深锄，一切也都依天气、地温的变化和棉花发育的需要来安排。从这里可以看出，张秋香对于各项技术措施是知其然而又知其所以然的，因此她在生产中运用各项技术措施，就能得心应手，灵活自如。　　正因为如此，张秋香就不满足于已有的经验，更没有像狭隘经验主义者那样为经验所束缚。她时时勤动脑筋，留心研究生产中出现的新问题，不怕新事物冲破旧有的经验的圈子。看到土地、水利、肥料等等条件变化了，她就多留棉枝和棉桃，以便多收棉花。而这样做，又使田间管理发生了一些新问题（如透光通风困难之类），于是她又一面自己钻研寻求解决这些问题的办法，一面又到外地学习新经验。这里，又表现了勇于接受新事物、不断前进的风格。
    任何好的增产措施都不会自己生效，只有生产者和生产指导者熟练地掌握了这些增产措施，才能充分发挥它们的增产作用。水利、肥料、土壤、品种、密植和田间管理，这些都是人所共知的增产措施；但是由于人们掌握和运用这些措施的具体作法不同，获得的效果也就会有所差异，有时甚至会有很大的差异。正像烹饪一样，同是煎、炒、蒸、煮、烩、炖，普通的炊事人员运用这些方法只能做出普通的菜，高明的厨师运用这些烹饪方法却能制出精美适口的佳肴。这里的差别就在于粗和精，巧和拙的不同。种庄稼也是一样。水、肥、土、种、密加上田间管理，也有着深奥的学问。现在我们有不少又红又专的干部和农民积极分子都能像张秋香一样精通自己岗位上的各种技术措施。但是也还有相当多的干部和农民积极分子只是粗通这些技术措施，对于这些东西，他们是知其然而不完全知其所以然；知其大略，而不知其细微；知道在普通情况下怎样做，而不知道在另一个情况下怎样做。生产中的盲目性和经验主义，跟这有很大关系。这些同志应当学习张秋香的榜样，创造性地指导生产和进行劳动。这就是说，须要通过学习和实践，下苦工夫钻研生产，以便深刻地理解各项增产措施的作用和它们之间的关系，不断地接受生产中的新事物，不断地丰富自己对于生产规律的知识。这样，他们就能精通本行的生产业务了。这样，他们就能在生产的海洋中自由地游泳了。
