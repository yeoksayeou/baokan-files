    Who Created the "Tool-Free" Granary?
    I heard a story at the grain system technical innovation exhibition: Some people said that Henan's "tool-free" granary was created by Jia County, while others said it was created by Xu Quanren, a Red Army veteran from Xiang County.

    Who exactly created the "tool-free" granary? Many people wanted to know. Later, after checking, both of these statements were correct, and also incorrect. It turned out that this tool originated in Jia County, and then, after improvements by Xu Quanren, a Red Army veteran, it gradually became perfected. Moreover, even at Xu Quanren's place, it was he who led a collective of warehouse workers to improve it.

    Xu Quanren, who is over sixty years old, originally worked half-time recuperating at the Xiang County Martyrs' Memorial Hall. However, he repeatedly requested to work in the most difficult places. The county magistrate couldn't dissuade him, so he sent him to a notorious "moldy warehouse." After he went there, he worked hard day and night. The workers were inspired by his communist ideology and were all determined to improve the warehouse. In this way, no one expected that this moldy warehouse would quickly become a "model warehouse," and, moreover, it was here that a heat-gathering, high-temperature insecticidal, "tool-free" granary was created.

    谁创造的“无器材”粮仓？
    我在粮食系统技术革新展览会上听到过这样一个故事：有人说河南的“无器材”粮仓是郏县创造的，有人说是襄县的红军老战士许全仁创造的。
    “无器材”粮仓究竟是谁创造的呢？很多人都想知道。后来，核对一下，这两个说法都对，也都不对。原来，这种工具创始于郏县，而后经过红军老战士许全仁的改进，才逐渐臻于完善。而且，就是在许全仁那里，也是他领着一个仓库的工人集体改进的。
    年过花甲的许全仁，原来是在襄县烈士纪念馆半疗养半工作的。可是他再三要求到最艰苦的地方工作，县长劝不下他，才把他送到一个有名的“霉烂仓”去。他去了以后，日夜苦干，职工们受到他的共产主义思想的感召，也都决心把仓库搞好。就这样，谁也没料到，就是这个霉烂仓，很快成了“模范仓”，而且，就是在这里创造出了一种聚热高温杀虫、“无器材”粮仓。（新记）
