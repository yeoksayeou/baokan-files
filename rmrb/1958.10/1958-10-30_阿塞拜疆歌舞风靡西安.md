Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 29th. The Soviet Azerbaijan National Song and Dance Troupe, led by its director Sait Zadeh, left Xi'an on the afternoon of October 29th after a week-long visit and performances in Xi'an.

This song and dance troupe from the "Land of Song and Dance" achieved great success in Xi'an. Their excellent folk songs and dances captivated nearly 40,000 spectators. In addition, more than 120,000 listeners listened to live recordings of their performances on the radio. Azerbaijani folk art has become a household name in Xi'an. The Shaanxi Daily and Xi'an Daily published a large number of articles and pictures to satisfy the audience's demands.

During their stay in Xi'an, the song and dance troupe also performed for more than 10,000 workers and farmers in Xi'an's "Electrical Engineering City" and the Dongfeng People's Commune. After watching their performances, the workers and farmers wrote letters of thanks, expressing their gratitude for the troupe's tireless visit by continuing to vigorously promote the technological revolution and launching high-yield wheat "satellites". The song and dance troupe also toured many of Xi'an's famous historical sites and exchanged experiences with Xi'an's song and dance workers. They praised the Xi'an People's Song and Dance Troupe for quickly learning Azerbaijani songs such as "My Little Chicken". During their stay in Xi'an, they were warmly received by the leaders of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, government, and cultural and artistic departments.

    阿塞拜疆歌舞风靡西安
    新华社西安29日电　苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团在团长萨伊特·扎德率领下10月23日到达西安作了一周的访问演出后，已于29日下午离开西安。
    这个来自“歌舞之乡”的歌舞团在西安演出获得了最大的成功。它们的优秀民歌和民间歌舞陶醉了近四万名观众，另外，还有十二万多听众在广播上收听了它们演出的实况录音。阿塞拜疆民间艺术在西安已是烩炙人口。陕西日报和西安日报刊载了大量文章和图片来努力满足观众的要求。
    歌舞团在西安期间，还在西安的“电工城”和东风人民公社为一万多名工人和农民演出，工人和农民看了它们的演出后，写了感谢信，表示要以继续大闹技术革命和大放小麦高产“卫星”来感谢歌舞团不辞劳苦的访问。歌舞团还游览了西安的许多名胜古迹，并和西安的歌舞工作者交流了经验。他们对西安人民歌舞团很快学会了阿塞拜疆的“我的小鸡”等歌曲称赞不已。他们在西安期间受到陕西省党政和文化艺术部门负责人的热烈接待。
