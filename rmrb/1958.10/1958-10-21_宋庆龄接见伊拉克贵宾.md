Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th - Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, received the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation headed by Mahmoud in Shanghai this afternoon.

　　Vice-Chairman Soong had a cordial conversation with the guests. She asked the delegation to convey her respects to the independent Iraqi people. She said: In the struggle against colonialism and for national independence, the Chinese people will always be the most faithful friends of the Iraqi people. The sun is rising in the East, and the African and Asian people who have stood up are undertaking the task of new historical creators. Imperialism does not have much life left, but it is still struggling. It is hoped that the Iraqi people will be full of confidence in victory, strengthen unity, and be vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism. Our common cause is to safeguard world peace and develop the cause of human progress. May we work together.

　　Mahmoud expressed his gratitude for the support given by the Chinese people to the Iraqi people, and said: The Iraqi people will give their full support to the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan. Taiwan is Chinese territory and will eventually be returned to China.

　　Also present at the reception were Gong Dafei, Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and Director of the China-Iraq Friendship Association, and Zhang Yaohui, Director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
