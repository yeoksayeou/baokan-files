General Wang Ping said: "When we return to our motherland, we will continue to be concerned about the common cause of our two peoples in resisting aggression and defending peace, just as we were in Korea. If the U.S. imperialism and its followers dare to launch another war of aggression against Korea, then as long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters across the Yalu River once again to fight together with the Korean People's Army to crush the enemy's invasion.

After the farewell meeting, the Party and government leaders of North Pyongan Province held a grand farewell banquet.

After the banquet, the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers continued to board the train and headed towards Andong. The people of Sinuiju cheered and watched the train carrying the returning heroes drive onto the Yalu River Bridge.

    新华社安东26日电　中国人民志愿军总部官兵，今天十二时十分乘坐最后一列撤军列车，回到祖国边疆城市安东。至此，中国人民志愿军已全部撤离朝鲜，回到祖国了。
    归国英雄们受到以廖承志为首的中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团和安东市各界人民的热烈欢迎。当载着最后一批归国英雄的列车，离开朝鲜的英雄国土，驶过鸭绿江桥，穿过“凯旋门”，徐徐驶进车站时，从鸭绿江桥头排列到站台上的欢迎人群，高举花束，摇动彩旗，欢呼跳跃起来，锣鼓声，鞭炮声响彻云霄。志愿军官兵们，把头探出车厢，眼里含着感激的泪水，向祖国亲人们致谢。
    列车停稳后，杨勇司令员、王平政治委员和其他将军们，健步走出车厢，先后同廖承志等祖国亲人的代表们热烈的握手、拥抱，站台上到处响起了亲切的问候声。一群孩子跑上前，喊着“志愿军叔叔辛苦了”，把一束束的鲜花献给志愿军官兵。
    接着，廖承志等陪同杨勇上将、王平上将等官兵代表走出车站，徒步通过高大的彩牌楼，穿过四千人的夹道欢迎队伍，前往安东旅社休息。这时，人们摆动着花束，喊着口号，纷纷向归国的英雄们身上撒彩色纸屑。杨勇司令员、王平政治委员，也举起鲜花，向欢迎人群致意，并不断地高呼“毛主席万岁”。
    今天到车站欢迎的还有朝鲜驻我国大使馆参赞文在洙。
    新华社安东26日电　以廖承志为首的中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团，今晚在安东举行盛大宴会，欢宴中国人民志愿军总部的全体官兵，庆贺抗美援朝的伟大胜利和英雄们的凯旋归来。
    以廖承志为首的代表团全体人员在餐厅门口欢迎志愿军总部全体官兵入席。

    廖承志在宴会开始时讲话。他说，你们经过了八年的艰苦奋斗，今天光荣地回到了祖国的怀抱。这不仅是中国人民、亚洲人民的胜利，也是全世界爱好和平人民的胜利。他说，你们的功绩，是全中国人民子子孙孙万世万代永远不会忘记的。他的讲话时时被欢呼声和鼓掌声打断。志愿军官兵们不断高呼“感谢祖国亲人的热烈欢迎！”“光荣属于中国共产党！”“光荣属于毛主席！”“光荣属于祖国人民！”
    志愿军司令员杨勇上将在宴会上衷心地感谢祖国人民对他们的热诚欢迎。他说，祖国人民奋发的劳动热情和革命干劲，宏伟的气魄和高尚的共产主义风格，对志愿军有着极大的教育和鼓舞作用。今后，志愿军决心立即投入到保卫祖国和建设祖国的斗争中去，一定要像执行抗美援朝任务一样来完成祖国所赋予的新任务。
    席间，鲍尔汉、康克清，老舍等人先后向归国英雄们祝酒。
    宴会后，中国京剧院第一团为归国英雄们举行了慰问演出晚会。

    朝鲜劳动党平安北道委员会委员长徐春植在会上致欢送词。他说：
  “在你们最后撤离我国的这一时刻里，朝鲜人民的每一颗善良的心，都充满着对经常给予我们以无微不至的至诚的援助的六亿中国兄弟和英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们的无限热爱、感谢和尊敬。”
    徐春植说：中国人民志愿军在战争时期以鲜血援助了我们，在战后时期又以高贵的劳动对我国人民幸福生活和和平生活给予了至诚的援助。中国人民志愿军这种高尚的道德品质，我们全朝鲜人民将永远记在心里，而且将同朝鲜人民的社会主义建设成就一起永放光芒。
    接着，平安北道人民委员会委员长宋昌簾代表平安北道人民委员会、朝鲜劳动党平安北道委员会向中国人民志愿军赠送了锦旗。各界人民向志愿军赠送了礼品。
    中国人民志愿军政治委员王平上将在欢送大会上作告别讲话。他代表全体官兵，向新义州人民和全朝鲜人民表示最深切的感谢和最崇高的敬意。
    王平上将说：“我们回到祖国将仍然像在朝鲜的时候一样，继续关怀着我们两国人民反抗侵略、保卫和平的共同事业。如果美帝国主义和他的追随者，胆敢再一次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起，为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。
    欢送大会结束后，平安北道党政领导人举行了盛大的欢送宴会。
    宴会后，志愿军官兵们继续登车向安东进发。新义州人民一直欢呼着目送归国英雄们乘坐的列车驶上鸭绿江桥。
