Dear Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
Dear officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers:
Dear comrades and friends:

Tomorrow, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who raised the sacred banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea," participated in the Korean front alongside us, and sincerely helped the Korean people, will completely withdraw from our country.

Today, on the eve of our final farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the hearts of all the Korean people are filled with deep emotion and endless gratitude for the friends who have shared life and death and weathered storms together for the past eight years.

On behalf of all the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Republic's government, I extend my heartfelt thanks and respect to you who are about to return home after gloriously completing the great mission of "Resist America, Aid Korea."

Eight years ago, when the Korean people's struggle to defend the freedom and independence of their homeland against the armed aggression of sixteen imperialist countries led by the United States was at its most difficult, the fraternal Chinese people sent us the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their finest sons and daughters. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the war was a just act of jointly opposing imperialist aggression, safeguarding the freedom, independence, and revolutionary achievements of our people, and defending peace and socialism. The participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers turned the Korean War in a direction favorable to us. The joint combat of the Korean and Chinese people's armies was a powerful force that defeated the American aggressors.

From the first day of their participation in the war, the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers withstood the test of war together with our People's Army, bravely overcame difficulties, and inflicted heavy blows on the American aggressors. The Chinese People's Volunteers, in close coordination with the Korean People's Army, fully demonstrated collective heroism and invincible combat power in many battles and campaigns such as the counterattacks along the Chongchon River and Changjin Lake, the defensive battles along the south bank of the Han River and the Zhaoyang River and the mobile warfare along the Yeoncheon boundary line, the defensive battle of Triangle Hill, and the counterattack south of Kumsong. During the three years of war, the Korean and Chinese people's armies, through their heroic struggles, completely shattered the myth of the so-called "strength" of the head of world imperialism—the American imperialist aggressors, and made the Western imperialists bow before us Eastern people who had been mistreated and oppressed by them for so long.

The Korean and Chinese people's armies defeated the American imperialist aggressors, foiled the enemy's sinister attempt to use Korea as a springboard to expand the flames of war, and staunchly defended peace in the Far East and the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

The victory we achieved in the common struggle against the American imperialist aggressors clearly proves that the power of the people who have been liberated from imperialist oppression, who firmly hold sovereignty in their own hands, and who are led by Marxist-Leninist parties is strong; and it shows that no imperialist can stop the people who are strongly united in the socialist family from moving forward.

The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers—defended every inch of our homeland with their blood and left indelible feats and achievements in our past Fatherland Liberation War, along with our People's Army.

In the most difficult period of the war, they used the hearts of their youth to block the enemy's firing ports, ensuring the victory of the war; in fierce battles, when they ran out of ammunition, they hugged explosives and jumped into the enemy's positions, annihilating the enemy; and they unhesitatingly sacrificed their lives for the freedom and independence of our country and for peace in the Far East.

Hero Huang Jiguang even said in his last words: "Dear Korea, what difference is there between you and my hometown, my motherland! The enemy's bullets can take my life, but they can never take away my motherland and my Korean brothers." This sentence clearly demonstrates the warm internationalist spirit of all the Volunteer Army warriors.

The noble internationalist spirit and heroism displayed by the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the arduous struggle against the American imperialists have aroused boundless respect and trust not only among our people but also among peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world.

The great achievements left by the fraternal officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on our homeland will forever live in the hearts of our people. I take this opportunity to once again pay my highest respect to all the officers and soldiers of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers who have established immortal merits on the Korean front and are returning to their homeland.

For the past eight years, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, cultivated by the glorious Communist Party of China, have unerringly demonstrated the noble moral qualities that only a true people's army armed with Marxism-Leninism can maintain. They cherished every mountain, river, tree, and blade of grass in Korea as if they were their own, and helped our people with sincere affection and sincerity, as if they were treating their own relatives.

They even sacrificed their own lives to save the lives and property of our people, and used the gaps in fierce fighting to help our farmers with agricultural production, repaired destroyed roads and bridges, and saved food rations to distribute to our war-stricken people.

In the post-war period, the fraternal officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the soldiers of the People's Army, firmly guarded the line of peace and, under the slogan of "Everyone should do more good deeds for the Korean people!" spared no effort in all aspects to help the Korean people mobilize to fight for the restoration of cities and villages that had been turned into ruins.

Since coming to Korea, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have helped farmers cultivate land, sow seeds, transplant rice seedlings, weed, and harvest crops on a total area of more than 284,000 chongbo, and have restored and built many houses, schools, public buildings, factories, railways, and bridges, and have dug more than 1,200 kilometers of canals, and have also helped build thousands of large and small irrigation projects and dikes, as well as reservoirs, etc.

Near the time of their withdrawal from Korea, the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers handed over their barracks, equipment, buildings, materials, and equipment to our People's Army free of charge. The fruits obtained from your sincere help to our people will shine brightly in the happy lives of the Korean people forever.

Our people have always loved and respected the Chinese People's Volunteers as if they were their own children, and regarded doing everything possible to support the Chinese People's Volunteers as their bounden duty and their infinite joy.

In the arduous struggle against the American imperialist aggressors, the heroic sons and daughters of the Korean and Chinese people, with a burning heart to defend their motherland and hometown, overcame all kinds of difficulties shoulder to shoulder, resolutely sacrificed their lives at dangerous moments, saved their comrades, and helped each other, setting a vivid example of proletarian internationalism. The victorious common struggle of our two peoples, who had formed a traditional friendship in the long bloody revolutionary struggle against the Japanese imperialist plunderers, has made the internationalist friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people an even more invincible force. The fraternal friendship and solidarity between the two peoples, consolidated and developed in the arduous struggle against the common enemy, has embroidered the most beautiful page not only in the history of the two peoples but also in the history of progressive mankind. It was with this great force of friendship that the Korean and Chinese people terrified and subdued the American imperialists, who boasted of being the "strongest in the world." No force can destroy the great friendship and solidarity of our two peoples, forged in blood and severely tested in the struggle for national independence and freedom.

Dear comrades, eight years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers came to Korea to stop American imperialist aggression and to defend peace, and today they are withdrawing from our country to consolidate peace in Korea and to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers have once again clearly demonstrated through their actions that they have made and are making consistent and sincere efforts for the peaceful reunification of our country and for peace in the Far East and the world. Today, all progressive mankind and peace-loving people throughout the world unanimously support the proactive measures taken by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the great contributions they have made to the cause of peace, and are watching the future actions of the American aggressor group with sharp eyes.

Today, as the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to complete their withdrawal from the northern half of the Republic, American imperialism cannot justify its occupation of South Korea for any reason.

However, the American imperialists are resolutely opposed to the peaceful reunification of our country and are more openly carrying out aggressive actions that threaten peace in Korea and the Far East.

On the day when the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from the north, the American imperialists, who occupied the southern half of our country, not only did not withdraw from South Korea, but also desperately struggled to occupy South Korea forever and intensify the tense situation in Korea. They transported atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic war, and instigated the Syngman Rhee gang to create constant "northward" disturbances. Recently, the American aggressors dared to carry out provocative actions against the People's Republic of China, thereby seriously threatening the situation in the Far East. Disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, they have increased their military strength in the Taiwan Strait and continued to invade Chinese territorial waters and airspace. At a time when the unanimous hope of the people of the world for peace is greater than ever, American imperialism continues to intensify the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait, thereby exposing its ferocious face more clearly to all mankind. As everyone knows, Taiwan and other coastal islands have been an inseparable part of China's territory since ancient times, and the Chinese people have the right to exercise their sovereignty over these islands, and no one can infringe upon this sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. American imperialism must immediately stop its brutal interference in China's internal affairs and must immediately withdraw from Taiwan and other coastal islands of China. The Korean people firmly believe that the Chinese people's just struggle for the liberation of Taiwan will be victorious.

If American imperialism estimates that it can entrench itself in South Korea and Taiwan to satisfy its aggressive ambitions, then it has miscalculated. American imperialism should see clearly the situation in Asia today. The era in which imperialism arbitrarily invaded and plundered the people of the East is gone forever. The Korean and Chinese people have fully demonstrated this truth to the American aggressors in the Korean War. If the American aggressors forget the historical lessons of the shameful and miserable defeat they suffered in the Korean War, ignore the serious warnings and protests of the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and continue to carry out foolish aggressive plots and insist on taking the dangerous path of launching a war, then it will not be able to avoid a defeat even more cruel than the Korean War and will suffer the consequences of playing with fire and burning itself. The Korean people, who have formed a flesh-and-blood relationship with the Chinese people in the long and arduous common struggle against foreign aggressors, will, in the future, also march forward side by side with the Chinese people forever, along with the people of all countries in the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, in the struggle against the American imperialist policy of war and for maintaining lasting peace in the Far East and the world.

The forces of peace and socialism, led by the great Soviet Union, possess the powerful strength and all the means to stop and smash the imperialists' new war provocations. The great strength of the Korean and Chinese people, closely united in the socialist camp family, is growing stronger day by day.

Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, Korea has healed the serious wounds of war in a short period of time and has now entered a new high tide of a great revolution in socialist construction. Our working people clearly see the broad prospects of socialist construction and are galloping with the spirit of Chollima to complete the first five-year plan one and a half years ahead of schedule, and to complete the programmatic tasks proposed by Comrade Kim Il-sung in his report commemorating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, which are to be implemented in six or seven years.

Our people are now enthusiastically supporting the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, which is to complete the task of transforming nature that has never been done in our history—expanding the irrigated area of one million chongbo of dry land and paddy fields—in two or three years; to successfully carry out the task of strengthening heavy industry bases such as the metal industry; and to widely launch a collective innovation movement in all departments, creating new miracles at all times. On this land defended by the heroic sons and daughters of the Korean and Chinese people with their blood, our people will surely let the happy life of socialism blossom and bear fruit. We believe that this is the way to promote the peaceful reunification of our country and the internationalist obligation that should be fulfilled for our common great cause of peace and socialism.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the 650 million Chinese people are vigorously launching a labor upsurge to overfulfill the second five-year plan, and are making great leaps forward in all sectors of the national economy, such as industry and agriculture. The victory of the socialist revolution on the vast land of China is rapidly transforming the People's Republic of China into a great socialist power. The People's Republic of China is playing a huge role in further strengthening the unified power of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and in maintaining world peace. All these achievements of the fraternal Chinese people infinitely encourage our people who are fighting for the peaceful reunification of the country and for socialism. Our people are proud to have the great Soviet Union and socialist China as their neighbors, and to have such reliable friends.

Today, the Korean and Chinese people, who firmly defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, are closely united by the commonality of Marxist-Leninist thought, the common goals of peace and socialism, and the unbreakable friendship of proletarian internationalism. The strong friendship and cooperative relationship between our two peoples is a guarantee for the prosperity of the two peoples who are making great leaps forward on the road to socialism and for the security and peace of the Far East. No conspiracy of the enemy can stop the just struggle and the advancing path of the Korean and Chinese people. All the Korean people will bravely overcome difficulties and obstacles, and will surely victoriously strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the great cause of socialist construction in the northern part of the Republic.

Dear comrades! You will be leaving our country tomorrow, but our Korean people's hearts will be with you forever—the comrades who have overcome arduous trials in the struggle against the common enemy, the American imperialist aggressors, and who have shared life and death and weal and woe together. More than 6,847,000 Korean people throughout the country have already signed their names on letters to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the fraternal Chinese people. This shows how deep the feelings of gratitude and love that our people have for the close friends of the great neighbor. The Korean people will resolutely make every effort to further strengthen and develop the flesh-and-blood relationship with the fraternal Chinese people in the big family of the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Distinguished comrades! I wish you a safe journey! I hope that after returning to your homeland, you will convey the deep gratitude and love of the Korean people to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. We sincerely wish you brilliant achievements in the great cause of socialist construction and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world after your return to your country.

Eternal glory belongs to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers who gloriously completed the sacred task of "Resist America, Aid Korea" and returned to their homeland!

Long live the Communist Party of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong and the great Chinese people!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese people!

    金一副首相在平壤欢送志愿军大会上讲话
    朝中伟大友谊使美国丧魂失魄亲爱的中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇同志和政治委员王平同志：亲爱的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们：亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    高举“抗美援朝”的神圣旗帜，参加朝鲜前线同我们一起战斗，并诚心诚意帮助朝鲜人民的兄弟的中国人民志愿军官兵们，明天就要全部撤离我国了。
    今天，在最后送别中国人民志愿军官兵们的前夕，全体朝鲜人民的心里充满着对八年来同生死共患难的朋友难舍难分的情意和话不尽的感谢。
    我以全朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的名义向光辉地完成
  “抗美援朝”的伟大任务后即将回国的你们，致以衷心的感谢和荣誉。
    八年前，在朝鲜人民反对以美国为首的十六个帝国主义武装侵略者保卫祖国的自由和独立的斗争处于最艰苦的时期，兄弟的中国人民给我们派遣了以自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军。中国人民志愿军的参战，是共同反对帝国主义侵略，保卫我们人民的自由独立和革命果实，捍卫和平和社会主义的正义行动。中国人民志愿军的参战，使朝鲜战争向对我们有利的方向转变了。朝、中人民军队的共同作战，是击溃美国侵略者的强有力的力量。
    兄弟的中国人民志愿军从参战的第一天起，同我们人民军队一起经受了战争考验，英勇地克服了困难，给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击。中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军紧密协同作战，在清川江边和长津湖的反击战、汉江南岸和照阳江边以及砚里界线的机动战、上甘岭的防御战和金城以南的反击战等许多战役和战斗中，充分地显示了集体英雄主义和不可战胜的战斗威力。朝中人民军队在三年来的战争时期，以自己的英勇斗争，彻底地粉碎了世界帝国主义的头子——美帝国主义侵略者的所谓“强大性”的神话，使西方帝国主义者在长久以来被他们虐待和压迫的我们东方人民面前屈膝了。
    朝中人民军队战胜了美帝国主义侵略者，粉碎了敌人以朝鲜为跳板，扩大战争火焰的凶恶企图，坚强地保卫了远东的和平和社会主义阵营的东方前哨。
    我们在反对美帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争中所获得的胜利，清楚地证明了：从帝国主义压迫下获得了解放的、把主权牢固地掌握在自己手中的、在马克思列宁主义政党领导下的人民的力量是强大的；并且显示了：任何帝国主义者都挡不住坚强的团结在社会主义大家庭里前进的人民。
    中国人民的优秀儿女——英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵在过去的我们的祖国解放战争中，同我们人民军一道，以鲜血保卫了我们祖国的每一寸土地，留下了不可磨灭的伟勋和业绩。
    他们在战争最艰苦的时期，用青年的心脏堵住敌人的射击口，保障了战争的胜利；在剧烈的战斗中，用尽弹药，就抱着炸药，跳进敌人阵地，歼灭了敌人；为我们祖国的自由和独立，为远东的和平，毫不踌躇地献出了自己的生命。
    黄继光英雄还最后说了这样一句话：“可爱的朝鲜，你和我的家乡、我的祖国有什么区别呢！敌人的子弹可以夺去我的生命，但决不能夺去祖国和朝鲜的兄弟。”这句话清楚地说明全体志愿军勇士们具有热烈的国际主义精神。
    中国人民志愿军官兵在反对美帝国主义者的艰苦的斗争中所发挥的高尚的国际主义精神和英雄气概，不仅在我国人民中，而且在热爱和平和正义的全世界人民中唤起了无限尊敬和信赖。
    兄弟的中国人民志愿军官兵在我们祖国土地上留下的丰功伟绩，将永远活在我国人民的心里。我借这个机会再一次向在朝鲜前线建立了不朽功勋的返回祖国的英雄的中国人民志愿军全体官兵致以崇高的敬意。
    八年来，光荣的中国共产党培养出来的中国人民志愿军官兵，无遗地发挥了只有以马克思列宁主义武装起来的真正的人民军队才能保持的高尚的道德品质。他们像爱护自己的东西一样爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木，像对待自己的亲人一样以诚挚的情谊，诚心诚意地帮助了我国人民。
    他们甚至牺牲自己的生命，拯救了我国人民的生命和财产，利用激烈的战斗空隙，帮助了我国农民的农业生产，修了被破坏的公路和桥梁，节约口粮分给了我国战争灾民。
    在战后时期，兄弟的中国人民志愿军官兵和人民军将士一起坚固地守卫了和平防线，并在“每个人都要为朝鲜人民多做一件好事！”的口号下，从各方面不惜一切地帮助了朝鲜人民一致动员起来为恢复变成废墟的城市和农村而进行斗争。
    中国人民志愿军官兵来到朝鲜以来，帮助农民耕地、播种、插秧、锄草、秋收的面积共达二十八万四千多町步，并恢复和新建了许多住宅、学校、公共建筑物、工厂、铁路和桥梁，挖好了共达一千二百多公里的水渠，还帮助兴修了数千所大小灌溉工程和堤坝以及水库等。
    中国人民志愿军司令部临近撤出朝鲜时期就把自己的营房、设备、建筑物、物资及器材都无偿地交给了我们人民军队。由于你们给予我国人民的诚挚的帮助而得到的果实，将在朝鲜人民的幸福的生活中永放光芒。
    我国人民像热爱自己的亲儿女一样经常热爱和尊重中国人民志愿军，并把竭尽一切力量给予中国人民志愿军的支援当做自己应尽的义务，当做自己无限的喜悦。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略者的艰苦的斗争中，朝中两国人民英雄的儿女们怀着一颗保卫自己祖国和家乡的火热的心，肩并肩地克服种种困难，在危险的关头毅然牺牲自己的性命，拯救了战友并互相帮助，树立了无产阶级国际主义的活生生的榜样。早在反对日本帝国主义掠夺者长期流血的革命斗争中结成了传统的友谊关系的我们两国人民胜利的共同斗争，使朝中两国人民之间结成的国际主义友谊团结，成为更加战无不胜的力量。两国人民的在反对共同敌人的艰苦的斗争中巩固和发展起来的兄弟的友谊团结，不仅在两国人民的历史上而且在进步人类的历史上绣成了最美丽的一页。朝中两国人民就用这一伟大的友谊力量使自夸为“世界最强”的美帝国主义丧魂失魄，并使它们屈服了。任何力量也决不能破坏在为民族独立和自由的斗争中以鲜血结成的经历了严重考验的我们两国人民的伟大的友谊团结。
    亲爱的同志们，八年前为了制止美帝国主义侵略，为了保卫和平来到朝鲜的中国人民志愿军，今天为了巩固朝鲜的和平，为了促进朝鲜的和平统一撤离我国了。中国人民和中国人民志愿军以实际行动再一次明确地证实了他们为我们祖国的和平统一、远东和世界和平，作出并作着一贯的有诚意的努力。今天全世界一切进步人类和爱好和平人民一致支持中国人民志愿军采取的主动措施，为和平事业作出的巨大贡献，并用尖锐的眼光注视着美国侵略集团今后的行动。
    在中国人民志愿军就要结束从共和国北半部撤军的今天，美帝国主义用任何理由也决不能把它强占南朝鲜的事实说成是正当的。
    但是美帝国主义者坚决反对我们祖国的和平统一，更加露骨地进行着威胁朝鲜和远东和平的侵略行动。
    强占我们祖国南半部的美帝国主义在中国人民志愿军从北部全部撤出的今天，不但不撤出南朝鲜，且变为永远强占南朝鲜和加紧朝鲜紧张局面而垂死挣扎。他们往南朝鲜运进了原子武器和导弹武器，使南朝鲜变为原子战争基地，并唆使李承晚匪帮制造不断的“北进”扰乱。最近美国侵略者竟敢进行着反对中华人民共和国的挑衅行动，从而使远东局势受到了严重的威胁。他们不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的屡次警告，在台湾海峡增强军事力量，继续侵犯中国领海和领空。在全世界人民对和平的一致希望比任何时候都更热爱和平的今天，美帝国主义在台湾海峡继续加剧紧张局势从而在全世界人类面前更加清楚地暴露了自己凶恶的面目。众所周知，台湾和其他沿海岛屿是自古以来的中国的不可分割的领土，中国人民有对这些岛屿行使自己主权的权利，任何人也决不能侵略中国人民这一神圣不可侵犯的权利。美帝国主义必须立即停止对中国内政的横暴干涉，必须立即从台湾和中国其他沿海岛屿撤走。朝鲜人民深信中国人民为解放台湾正义斗争将取得胜利。
    如果美帝国主义估计自己能够盘踞在南朝鲜和台湾满足自己阴谋的侵略野心，那就是它们打错了算盘。美帝国主义应该看清今天的亚洲的局势，帝国主义任意地侵略和掠夺东方人民的时代已一去不复返了。朝中人民已在朝鲜战争中给美国侵略者充分地显示了这个真理。如果美国侵略者忘记了在朝鲜战争中所遭到的可耻惨败的历史教训，无视朝中两国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的严重警告和抗议，继续进行愚蠢的侵略策划，硬走发动战争的危险道路的话，那么它就避免不了比朝鲜战争更加残酷的失败，并将遭到玩火自焚的结果。在反对外来侵略者的长期艰苦的共同斗争中与中国人民结成了血肉关系的朝鲜人民，在反对美帝国主义的战争政策和维护远东和世界持久和平的斗争中，今后也同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民一道永远和中国人民并肩前进。
    以伟大苏联为首的和平和社会主义力量具有能够制止和粉碎帝国主义新战争挑衅策划的强大力量和一切手段，在社会主义阵营的大家庭中紧紧团结起来的朝中人民的伟大力量正在得到日益强大。
    朝鲜在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，短时期内医治了战争的严重创伤，今天已经进入了社会主义建设的一个大革命的新高潮时期。我国劳动人民清楚地看到了社会主义建设的广阔前景，正在为提前一年半完成第一个五年计划，并为在四、五年内完成金日成同志在庆祝共和国成立十周年纪念报告中提出的要在六、七年内实行的纲领性任务，而以跨上千里马的气概奔驰着。
    我国人民现在热烈拥护朝鲜劳动党中央委员会9月全体会议决议，要在两三年内完成在我国历史上未曾有过的改观自然的任务——扩大一百万町步旱地与水田灌溉面积；胜利地进行加强金属工业等重工业基地的任务，在所有部门广泛地展开着集体革新运动，时时刻刻创造出新的奇迹。我国人民在朝中两国人民的英雄儿女以鲜血捍卫的这块土地上，一定会让社会主义幸福生活开花结果。我们认为这就是促进我们祖国和平统一的道路，也是对我们的和平和社会主义共同的伟大事业应尽的国际主义义务。
    六亿五千万中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的正确领导下，为了超额完成第二个五年计划大力掀起劳动热潮，在工业、农业等国民经济所有部门正在大跃进。在辽阔的中国土地上，社会主义革命取得了胜利，正使中华人民共和国急速转变为伟大的社会主义强国。中华人民共和国为进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的统一的威力和维护全世界和平起着巨大作用。兄弟的中国人民所取得的这一切成就，无限鼓舞着为祖国的和平统一和为社会主义而斗争的我国人民。我国人民因为有伟大苏联和社会主义中国作为自己的邻邦，因为有这样可靠的朋友，而感到骄傲。
    今天坚强地捍卫社会主义阵营东方前哨的朝中两国人民由于马列主义思想的共同性、和平和社会主义的共同目的，以无产阶级国际主义的牢不可破友谊紧紧地团结起来了。我们两国人民的坚强的友谊和合作关系，是在社会主义道路上大跃进的两国人民的繁荣和远东的安全与和平的保证。敌人的任何阴谋也不能阻挡朝中两国人民正义的斗争和前进的道路。全体朝鲜人民将勇敢地克服困难和障碍，必将胜利地争取祖国的和平统一和实现在共和国北部的社会主义建设的伟大事业。
    亲爱的同志们！你们明天就要离开我国了，但是，我们朝鲜人民的心将和你们——在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中冲破艰巨的考验、同生死共甘苦的战友永远在一起。全国有六百八十四万七千多名朝鲜人民已经在给英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵和兄弟的中国人民的信上签了名。这说明：我们人民对伟大邻邦的亲密的朋友抱有多么深厚的感谢和热爱的情意。朝鲜人民将坚决地根据马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，在以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营的大家庭中，为进一步加强和发展同兄弟的中国人民的血肉关系进行百般的努力。
    尊贵的战友们！祝你们一路平安！希望你们在回到祖国以后，把朝鲜人民对中国人民和中国人民志愿军的深深感谢和热爱的情意转告给中国人民。我们衷心的预祝：你们回国以后，在社会主义建设和保卫远东和世界和平的伟大事业中，获得辉煌的成就。
    永恒的光荣，属于光荣地完成“抗美援朝”的神圣任务而返回祖国的英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵！
    以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民万岁！
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
