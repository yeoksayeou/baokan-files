When we enter the National Grain System Technological Innovation Exhibition, a feeling of surprise, pride, and happiness wells up in our hearts. Hundreds and thousands of wonderful methods for warehousing and preservation, new processing machines, and countless pieces of indigenous mechanization, indigenous automation, or highly mechanized granaries, grain stores, and grain processing plants create a splendid picture.

Industrious and wise, the Chinese working people created many types of granaries and grain processing machines very early on. According to the "Book of Rites," during the Warring States period, China invented square, round granaries and cellars. At that time, Gongshuban of the State of Lu, the Grandpa Luban we often talk about, also created the stone mill. In the hands of the great mathematician Zu Chongzhi, who invented the circumference ratio during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, this mill was fitted with a water wheel and became a water mill, the ancestor of the water-powered pestles in southern China today. The wisdom of the working people is infinite. However, the exploitative system of old China bound the hands of heroes, and until liberation, China's grain storage and processing industry remained at a very backward level. In the north, people pushed mills and ground grain, while in the south, they pounded rice in stone mortars. All storage and processing largely used ancient tools and old methods that were hundreds or even thousands of years old.

Thinking of the past and looking at today, how can people not be surprised? How can they not feel proud and happy for the great creations of the nearly one million employees of the grain departments in our country over the past year!

Like Immortals Crossing the Sea, Each Displaying Their Unique Skills

Here, every exhibit is a treasure. The staff of the exhibition told me: "This is like immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique skills; it is not easy to judge which is better." I wandered in this ocean of treasures for a few days, and the more I looked, the more I felt that this statement was pertinent.

The grass stack granary in Jiangsu Province, covered with straw, is suitable for the south. The earth stack granary, made of adobe, is suitable for the north. Their cost is only about one-tenth of that of an ordinary folding-mat granary, but their effectiveness is no worse than that of an ordinary granary. People lingered in front of these thatched huts and earthen houses, praising them incessantly. However, when everyone walked in front of the "no equipment" granary in Henan Province, they would immediately feel that this treasure was even newer. This type of granary does not require the usual "necessary" equipment such as sacks, straw mats, and sleepers. It only needs to be built with surrounding walls around ordinary houses, with yellow sand sandwiched in the middle, and then sealed with some yellow sand covering the top of the granary. It requires almost no storage costs and can store large amounts of grain. There are already more than a thousand such granaries in Henan Province.

However, among the storage exhibits, the most attractive to visitors are the various indigenous machinery and automatic machinery of the indigenous mechanized granaries. The automatic wind sieve looks almost no different from an ordinary old windmill, but it is indeed a true "magician." Crowds of viewers surrounded it to watch its performance: the funnel filled with grain let the grain flow down, impacting the bellows like flowing water and driving the sieve to rotate. Then, the grain cleans itself by wind sieving. Just such a wooden machine, which looks unassuming, marks that the end of China's history of hand-cranked windmills is imminent. There are many exhibits at the meeting that stand shoulder to shoulder with this "magician." The lever-operated grain transport vehicle, known as the "Hercules," allows a female narrator to stand on it, lightly moving the lever up and down with one hand and operating the steering wheel with the other, and can carry thousands of pounds of grain at will. The aerial flying wheel car in Pan County, Guizhou Province, and the wind-powered conveyor in Liaoning Province, which combines indigenous and foreign methods, have even higher performance and effectiveness than the "Hercules." In addition, in terms of inspection and protection, many indigenous mechanical "scouts" that are locally sourced and simple in structure have also appeared, which are very low in cost and easy to promote.

Right next to these indigenous machines, we also saw many highly mechanized machines, including the latest model of a mechanized granary, infrared insect killers, electronic rapid moisture testers, and huge wind suction conveyors. This type of machine can suck grains from within more than 200 meters into its mouth and transfer them to warehouses or workshops. It is said that many of these machines can already be compared with the latest foreign products.

How to process grain to make it more fragrant and delicious, maximize the power of the Grain Marshal, and save more labor? Several magical processing machines in the exhibits provide ingenious methods. We saw a model of a waterborne processing boat from Sichuan Province. In relatively rapid currents, the flowing water impacts three pairs of water impellers beside the processing boat, causing the millstones, rollers, and wind sieves on the boat to rotate. As long as people load and take flour on the boat, three people can replace the labor of fifteen people and eighteen animals, and the work efficiency is increased by more than ten times. The wheat peeling machine created by Wang XueRui, a worker at Chengji Flour Mill in Jinan City, Shandong Province, is even more magical. It changed the historical situation of wheat being ground with the skin, resulting in less flour and an unwhite color. It is really strange. It swallows whole wheat at the top, and what it pulls out at the bottom is wheat kernels with the skin removed, like a stream flowing out. The narrator said: Compared with grinding wheat with the skin, making flour with wheat kernels increases the flour yield by more than two catties per hundred catties of wheat, the flour color is also whiter, and the nutrition is also higher.

Arrangements Have Been Made for Potatoes and Other Tubers

Hundreds of novel, practical, labor-saving, and money-saving potato cellars and processing tools provide extremely favorable conditions for the safe storage, safe wintering, and comprehensive utilization of the thousands of billions of catties of potatoes and other tubers harvested in our country this year.

People praise the improved potato cellars, shed cellars, and well cellars in Hebei Province as "sweet potato sanatoriums." From the model, we can see that their temperature measurement, ventilation equipment, and storage performance are particularly good. Generally, they can be stored for more than half a year, and if sand is pressed in the cellar, they can be stored for a year without spoilage.

The wooden foot-operated high-speed potato slicer in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as long as one person steps on it, the knife disc rotates, and the silver light flashes, potato slices will surge out like a tide, and can cut seven or eight thousand catties per hour. This is the most effective machine for processing potato slices at the conference. The set of indigenous machinery of the starch joint processing plant exhibited in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, surprised the audience even more with its degree of perfection. This set of machinery consists of a cleaning machine, a shredding and powdering machine, and a water delivery and power system, which can process potato shreds and starch, and is suitable for various power sources. Muddy sweet potatoes enter the machine from one end, and starch slurry comes out from the other. The large water tank, winding water pipes, and even the faucets of this set of machinery are all made of Mao bamboo and wood produced in Hunan.

People regard every exhibit here as a red flag, saying that it is the crystallization of communist ideology. Without communist ideology in command, it would be impossible for the employees of the grain system to have an average of less than ten people with a new technological innovation achievement. The exhibits at the meeting could not be like today, mostly written with the name of the collective. (Attached image)

    服务粮帅妙法多
    本报记者　徐士杰
    当我们走进全国粮食系统技术革新展览会以后，一种惊奇、自豪、幸福的感觉，就会涌上心头。成百上千种的仓储保管妙法和新的加工机具，数不清的土机械化、土自动化或高度机械化的粮仓、粮店、粮食加工厂，组成了一幅绚烂的画面。
    勤劳、智慧的我国劳动人民，很早很早就创造了许多类型的粮仓和粮食加工机具。据“周礼”记载，战国时代，我国就发明了方形的、圆形的粮仓和地窖。当时，鲁国的公输班，就是我们常说的鲁班爷爷，还创造了石磨。这种磨，到了南北朝发明圆周率的大数学家祖冲之的手里，又加上水轮，变成水磨，成为今天我国南方水碓的鼻祖。劳动人民的智慧是无穷的。但是，旧中国的剥削制度把英雄的双手束着，直到解放前，我国的粮食保管加工事业还停留在十分落后的水平上。北方人推磨碾，南方石臼舂米，全部的仓储加工还大都沿用着几百年、乃至千年以前的古老工具和旧法。
    心想过去，眼看今天，人们怎么能不惊奇？怎么能不为我国近百万的粮食部门职工一年来的伟大创造而感到自豪，感到幸福！
    万仙过海  各显其能
    这里，每一件展品就是一件宝。展览会的工作人员告诉我：“这是万仙过海，各显其能，要评出个高低可不容易。”我在这个宝贝的海洋里游了几天，愈看就愈觉得这句话说得中肯。
    江苏省的草囤仓，用稻草围盖，适用于南方。土囤仓，用土坯砌成，适用于北方。它们的造价只抵普通折席式粮仓的十分之一上下，效用却比普通粮仓一点不差。人们在这些茅棚、土屋似的粮仓前留连很久，赞声不绝。可是，当大家走到河南省的“无器材”粮仓的前面，马上就会感到：这个宝贝更新奇。这种仓不用通常“必需”的麻袋、草席、枕木等粮仓器材，只需要在普通民房的四周砌上套墙，中间夹上黄砂，粮仓上再用一些黄砂复盖密封就成了。它几乎不用什么保管费用，就可以保管大量粮食。这种粮仓，在河南省已经有一千多座了。
    但是，在仓储展品中，最招引观众的还是那些土机械化粮仓的各类土机械和自动机械。自动风筛机外貌和普通的旧风车几乎没有区别，可是它确是个真正的“魔术家”。观众成群地围着看它表演：满装粮食的漏斗漏下粮食，像流水似地冲击风箱，并且带动筛子转动，然后，粮食自己把自己风筛干净。就是这样一部木制的机器，看来貌不惊人，但它却标志着我国结束几千年来手摇风车的历史，已经近在眉睫了。和这位“魔术家”平起平坐的展品，会上还有很多。被人誉为“大力士”的压杆运粮车，一个女讲解员站在上面，轻轻地一只手上下搬动压杆，一只手操纵方向盘，就可以载着上千斤粮食随意跑。而贵州省盘县的空中飞轮跑车，辽宁省的土洋结合的风力输送机，性能和功效又都比
  “大力士”要高得多。另外，检验和防护方面，也出现了许多就地取材、构造简单的土机械“侦察兵”，造价很低，非常易于推广。
    就在这些土机械的近旁，我们还看到了许许多多高度机械化的机具，有最新式的机械化粮仓模型，有红外线杀虫器和电子快速水分测定器等，也有巨大的风力吸运机。这种机器能把二百多公尺内的谷物吸进口里，转送到仓库或车间。据说，这些机具中有不少已可与国外最新的产品媲美。
    怎样把粮食加工得更清香可口，更大地发挥粮帅的威力，更多地节省劳动力？展品中有几种神通广大的加工机具，提供了巧妙的作法。我们面前出现了一艘四川省的水上加工船的模型。在较急的水流中，流水冲动加工船旁三对水叶轮，船上的磨盘、碾盘和风筛就会转动，人只要在船上装粮取粉，三个人就可代替十五个人、十八个牲口的劳动，而且工效提高十多倍。山东省济南市成记面粉厂工人王学锐创造的小麦脱皮机，更是妙法无边。历史上小麦连皮制粉，出粉少，色不白的情况被它改变了。它可真怪，上边吞下整麦，下边拉出的就是脱了皮的麦仁，就像流水似的涌出。讲解员说：用麦仁制粉，每百斤麦子跟连皮磨粉比较，出粉率提高两斤多，粉色也白，而且营养也高。
    为薯类作了安排
    数百种新颖、实用、省工省钱的薯窖和加工工具，给我国今年丰收的数千亿斤薯类安全贮藏、平安过冬、综合利用，提供了极有利的条件。
    人们夸奖河北省改良的薯窖、棚窖、井窖是“红薯疗养所”。从模型上可以看到：它们的测温、通风设备和保藏性能都特别好，一般地能保藏半年多，如果窖内压砂，还能保藏一年不坏。
    广西僮族自治区的木制脚踏高速薯类切片机，只要一个人用脚踏动，刀盘转动，银光闪闪，薯片就潮水似的涌出来，一小时能切七、八千斤。这是大会上加工薯片功效最高的机器。湖南省湘阴县展出的淀粉联合加工厂的一套土机械，观众们更是惊讶它的完善程度。这套机械由清洗机、切丝制粉机和送水、动力系统组成，能加工薯丝和淀粉，而且适用各种动力。带泥的红薯从一头进机器，另一头出来的就是淀粉浆。这套机械的大水箱、曲曲弯弯的水管，连水龙头也都是湖南盛产的毛竹和木材做成的。
    人们把这里的每一件展品都看作一面红旗，说它是共产主义思想的结晶。如果没有共产主义思想挂帅，粮食系统的职工就不可能平均不到十个人就有一项技术革新的新成就。会上的展品，也不可能像今天这样，大都写着集体的名字。（附图片）
