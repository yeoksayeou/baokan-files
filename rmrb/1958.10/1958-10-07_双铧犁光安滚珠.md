    Workers Zhang Zhenhua and Ma Dianyun of the Qianjin Bicycle Repair Shop in Qinhuangdao, Hebei Province, inspired by the principle of using Guang'an ball bearings without bearings in bicycle hubs, created a method for double-share plow wheels that eliminates the need for bearings by using Guang'an ball bearings. The specific method is as follows: Cut an oval flange from a 5-fen thin iron plate according to the original bowl size and weld it securely. Then, place the axle bowl inside the axle ring and secure it to the wheel. Put ball bearings inside the axle bowl. Install axle stops both inside and outside the axle, and also place ball bearings inside the stops. The advantages of using this method to modify double-share plow wheels are: first, they are sturdy and durable, with a wear resistance one time higher than that of installing No. 204 ball bearings; second, the cost is low, as installing No. 204 ball bearings costs more than ten yuan, while axle bowl beads only cost more than seven yuan; third, the structure is simple, allowing for self-production, self-installation, and self-repair; fourth, installation is easy. Installing bearings requires a lathe to grind the axle and turn the wheel, while Guang'an ball bearings only require drilling a hole in the axle.

    双铧犁光安滚珠
    河北秦皇岛市前进自行车修配社工人张振华、马殿云，根据自行车中轴光安滚珠不用轴承的道理，创造了双铧犁犁轮不用轴承光安滚珠的办法。具体作法是：按原扣碗大小，用五分薄铁板剪成椭圆形法兰盘加以焊固。然后把轴碗下到轴圈内，卡到轮上，在轴碗里放上珠粒；轴内外均安轴档，档内也放上珠粒。用这个办法改装双铧犁犁轮的优点是：第一，坚固耐用，较安204号滚珠轴承耐磨率高一倍；第二，成本低，安装204号滚珠轴承需十元多，而轴碗珠只用七元多；第三，构造简单，可以自作、自安、自修；第四，容易安装，安轴承得经车床磨轴旋轮，而光安滚珠，只要在轴上打个眼就行。
