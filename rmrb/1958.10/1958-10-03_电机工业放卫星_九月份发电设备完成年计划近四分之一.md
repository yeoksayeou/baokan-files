The staff and workers of the power equipment manufacturing industry, after a month of hard work, launched an unprecedented high-yield satellite in September and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. This year's leap forward plan for power equipment is 928,800 kilowatts, which is 4.7 times the actual output of last year. In September alone, 221,600 kilowatts of power equipment were completed, equivalent to 23.8% of the annual leap forward plan, which is 12.5% more than the total output in 1957.

    Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant and Harbin Electric Machinery Plant play a decisive role in completing this leap forward plan. In September, high-yield satellites were launched simultaneously in the north and south. The power equipment capacity produced by Harbin Electric Machinery Plant in one month was 46% more than the total capacity produced from January to August. The output of Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant also increased by 35% compared with August. These two modern factories are moving towards international levels in mastering the production technology of large-scale power equipment. In September, they simultaneously trial-produced 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, and Harbin Electric Machinery Plant also produced 60,000-kilowatt hydro-generators.

    Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant, Chongqing Electrical Equipment Plant, Xiaoshan Electric Machinery Plant, Boshan Electric Machinery Plant, Liaoning-Jilin Electric Power Bureau, Yunnan Electric Power Bureau, etc., which had never manufactured power equipment in the past, have all uncovered the secrets of manufacturing power equipment and are working hard to produce power equipment, becoming an emerging force that cannot be ignored in the power equipment manufacturing industry. Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Plant just established a workshop for producing generators on July 18. After 45 days of hard work, it trial-produced two 750-kilowatt steam turbine generators and one 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generator. Among them, the 1,500-kilowatt steam turbine generator only took one month, while according to general practice, such a complex product would take at least three to four months.

    电机工业放卫星
    九月份发电设备完成年计划近四分之一
    本报讯　发电设备制造工业的职工，经过一个月的苦战，9月份放出了空前的高产卫星，并获得了大面积丰收。今年发电设备的跃进计划是九十二万八千八百瓩，为去年实际产量的四点七倍，9月份一个月完成了发电设备二十二万一千六百瓩，相当于年跃进计划的23.8％，比1957年全年产量还多12.5％。
    上海电机厂和哈尔滨电机厂对完成这个跃进计划起着决定性的作用，9月份在南北两地同时放出高产卫星。哈尔滨电机厂一个月生产的发电设备容量比1至8月份生产的总容量还多46％，上海电机厂比8月份产量也提高了35％。这两个现代化工厂在掌握大型发电设备的生产技术方面，正向国际水平迈进，9月份同时试制完成二万五千瓩汽轮发电机，哈尔滨电机厂并制成了六万瓩水轮发电机。
    过去从来没有制造过发电设备的重庆建设机床厂、重庆电工器材厂、萧山电机厂、博山电机厂、辽吉电业局、云南电业局等，都揭开了制造发电设备的秘密，大干发电设备，成为发电设备制造业不可忽视的新生力量。重庆建设机床厂7月18日刚成立一个生产发电机的车间，苦战四十五天就试制完成两台七百五十瓩汽轮发电机和一台一千五百瓩汽轮发电机。其中一千五百瓩汽轮发电机仅仅花了一个月的时间，而按一般常规，这样复杂的产品至少需三、四个月。
