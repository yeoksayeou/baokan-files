    "The Poet is Oneself"
    Zhu Shulan
    Be a hero underground, be a model writer above ground.

    This gilded couplet is pasted on the pine memorial archway at the entrance of the Mentougou Coal Mine in the suburbs of Beijing. Walking through the gate, the colorful poem and painting boards on both sides of the road immediately attract people's attention. Each poem and painting board is carefully adorned with about a hundred neatly written poems and pictures. I softly chanted along the poem and painting boards, and it was as if countless majestic and loud songs were ringing in my ears, these songs converging into a torrent of inspiring emotion. This is the socialist ode of the coal miners. Listen:

      "Without clouds in the sky, it's hard to rain,
      Without soil underground, it's hard to take root,
      Without the Communist Party for the miners,
      It's hard to turn over even if our bones are broken."

    Walking along the road, it's all poetry like this. The workers sing the praises of the Communist Party, sing the praises of Chairman Mao; they express their determination to resolutely implement the General Line; they praise the new society, and denounce the old life; ... They sing about whatever is on their minds. A comrade next to me said: This has become a poetry street. Right! Poetry street, there is no more fitting name for it. On this poetry street, stretching three hundred meters from the entrance to the pithead, I read these poems of the coal miners over and over again, as if I were attending a vivid communist lesson.

    Who are the authors of these poems? All of them are coal miners. As they themselves sing: In the past, they were blind men, today they are writers. Mentougou Mine only completed its literacy campaign at the beginning of September. Starting in mid-September, in less than a month, a fiery mass literary and artistic activity unfolded. As of October 9th, more than 11,200 poems had been written by over 2,800 employees in the entire mine, with the most prolific writer having written 107 poems. This kind of energy, this kind of emotion, is expressed in a poem by Hu Yanting, a worker in the tunneling section:

      "Hearing that writing poetry is not easy,
      In reality, it is not mysterious,
      As long as you study hard,
      The poet is oneself."

    Speaking of this poem, it was written by Hu Yanting on the second day he started writing. Old Hu is tall, with an air of confidence. When people asked how this poem was written, he took out a small notebook from his pocket, flipping through it as he said, "I'm just learning to write, it's not very good."

    One night in mid-September, after finishing the night shift and taking a shower, it was already past eleven o'clock. Branch Secretary Lao Pan came to him, saying that cadres from the China Youth Art Theater had come to the mine to help them develop literary and artistic activities, and hoping that he would take the lead in writing poetry. Hu Yanting thought to himself: Write poetry? That's something new! Two or three years ago, he was still semi-literate. In the past two years, he has only finished the fifth or sixth grade textbooks intermittently. Now, writing is not yet smooth, how can he write poetry? The branch secretary seemed to see through Hu Yanting's thoughts, and addressing his superstitious ideas, pointed out that coal miners should not only surpass Britain on the production front, but also be experts on the cultural front, as long as they dare to think and dare to do, they can write anything. Hu Yanting saw that this was a task assigned by the Party, how could he not complete it? He didn't even bother to go home to rest, and sat down to write. At first, Hu Yanting really didn't know where to start. Later: Branch Secretary Pan's words about writing about both major national events and trivial matters around you suddenly reminded him, and all of a sudden, it was as if the levee had broken and water was gushing out, and he wrote five poems in one breath. The next day, when he went to the factory, he saw that many people's poems had been posted, and he thought, "I originally thought that writing poetry was very difficult, and it was not something for us coal miners, but now everyone is writing it, so it's not mysterious, it's true that as long as you dare to think and dare to write, you can write it." As he thought, he muttered to himself: Can't this meaning also be written into a poem to break down superstition? Today, this poem, which is praised by everyone in the mine, has been written on the couplet of another tall archway on the poetry street, and it will be a testament to the many coal miners who have just taken off their illiterate hats and picked up their pens to write the newest and most beautiful poems of our time.

    The workers of Mentougou Coal Mine have already begun to write poems of joy and happiness today, but they have not only begun to sing today. In the long dark night before liberation, they also left behind countless songs of pain and sorrow and anger. Old miner Bo Delu will tell you about the situation of those years, so you can't help but feel silent and sad. Take this whistle for example. Before liberation, whenever there was an accident in the mine, the whistle would sound like a wail, and the iron gate would immediately be crowded with family members dragging their children, craning their necks and trembling with fear that their husbands and sons would not return. A song like this was spread among the people:

      "The whistle sounds, like a gut-wrenching cry,
      Alarming wives and frightening mothers,
      Fathers and mothers await their children, wives await their husbands."

    In the past, coal miners used their most profound and powerful poems to denounce the darkness of the old society. Today, coal miners have begun to use the newest and most beautiful poems to praise the new life from the posture of masters. Their immortal poems will be like their selfless labor:

      Digging open Jiulong Mountain in one fell swoop,
      Black gold rolling outwards,
      Black gold surpasses the Yangtze River water,
      Flowing endlessly for thousands of years.

### “诗人就是自己”

    “诗人就是自己”
    朱树兰
    井下当超英好汉，井上当作家模范。
    这副金字对联，贴在京郊门头沟煤矿大门口的松枚牌楼上。走进大门，路两旁五颜六色的诗画牌，一下子就把人吸引住了，诗画牌上都精心地贴着约百来张字迹工整的诗歌和图画。我顺着一块块的诗画牌轻声低吟，耳边像响起无数支雄壮嘹亮的歌声，这歌声汇合成一道激动人心的巨流。这是煤矿工人的社会主义颂歌，你听：
      “天上无云难下雨，
      地下无土难生根，
      矿工没有共产党，
      挣断骨头难翻身。”
    一路走过去，都是这样的诗。工人们歌唱共产党，歌唱毛主席；表示了坚决实现总路线的决心；他们赞美新社会，控诉旧生活；……他们心里想着什么就歌唱什么。我旁边的一位同志说：这成了一条诗街了。对！诗街，再没有比这更合适的名称了。在这条进门一直到井口，足有三百公尺长的诗街上，我一遍又一遍地念着煤矿工人的这些诗歌，我像是上了一堂生动的共产主义课程。
    这些诗的作者是谁？都是煤矿工人。像他们自己唱的：过去睁眼瞎，今天当作家。门头沟矿9月初才完成扫盲工作，从9月月中开始，不到一个月时间，一个火热的群众性文艺活动就展开了。到10月9日为止，全矿两千八百多职工已经写了一万一千二百多首诗，最多的一个人写了一百零七首。这种劲头，这种情绪，表现在掘进段工人胡延亭的一首诗里：
      “听说写诗不易，
      实际并不神秘，
      只要刻苦钻研，
      诗人就是自己。”
    说起这首诗，那不过是胡延亭开始写的第二天就写出来的。老胡高高的个儿，有一副充满自信的神气。当人们问起这首诗是怎样写出来的时候，他就从上衣口袋里拿出一个小记事本，一边翻，一边说：“我这是刚学着写，写不好。”
    9月中旬的一个夜晚，上完夜班洗过澡已经十一点多了，支部书记老潘来找他，说是中国青年艺术剧院的干部来矿上帮助他们开展文艺活动，希望他带头写诗。胡延亭一听，心想：写诗？新鲜事！头两、三年自己还是个半文盲，这两年断断续续才念完小学五、六册课本，如今，写起字来还不怎么顺心，那能够写诗呢？支部书记像是看透了胡延亭的心思，针对了他的迷信思想，指出煤矿工人不仅在生产战线上要超过英国，也应该是文化战线上的能手，只要敢想、敢干，什么都写得出来。胡延亭一看，这是党交给的任务，能不完成吗？他顾不得回家休息，坐下来就写。开头，胡延亭真不晓得从那里写起，后来：潘支书说的国家大事身边小事都能写这句话忽然提醒了他，一下子，就像堤裂了口水往外涌似的，一口气便写出了五首。第二天进厂，看见不少人写的诗都贴出来了，心里想，原以为写诗很不容易，没有我们煤矿工人的份，现在大家都写出来了，可见并不神秘，真是只要敢想、敢写就能写出来。想着想着，他自言自语说：这个意思不也能写成一首破除迷信的诗吗？如今，这首在矿上人人传颂的诗已经写在诗街另一座高大牌楼的对联上，它将是许许多多刚摘掉文盲帽子就提起笔来、写出我们这个时代最新最美诗歌的煤矿工人的见证。
    门头沟煤矿的工人们今天已经开始写着欢乐和幸福的诗篇，但是，他们不是今天才歌唱的，在解放前那漫长的黑夜里，他们也曾留下过不知多少痛苦哀歌和愤怒的歌。老矿工薄德禄会对你叙述当年的情景，叫你不能不黯默心酸。就拿这汽笛来说吧，解放前，矿上一出事故，汽笛就像哭号似的叫起来，铁门外面马上便挤满了拖儿带女的家属，她们伸着脖子心惊胆跳地害怕自己的丈夫、儿子回不来。人们中流传了这样一首歌：
      “汽笛响，似勾肠，
      惊动了妻子吓坏娘，
      爹妈盼儿女，妻子盼夫郎。”
    过去的煤矿工人用他们最深刻、最有力的诗句控诉了旧社会的黑暗，今天的煤矿工人已经开始从主人翁的姿态，用最新最美的诗句来歌颂新生活，他们不朽的诗篇将会同忘我的劳动一样：
      一下挖开九龙山，
      黑金滚滚往外翻，
      黑金赛过长江水，
      千年万世流不完。
