The Suffering of the American People

How Many are Unemployed?

What is the actual number of unemployed people in the United States? The official figures released by the U.S. government state that the number of unemployed in the United States in July was 5.3 million, but this is a greatly reduced figure, and the actual unemployment situation is much more serious.

According to the September issue of "Economic Notes" published by the American "Labor Research Association," if the large number of part-time workers who can only find a few hours of work each week are converted into unemployed, at least 1.5 million should be added to the official unemployment figure. Thus, "the actual number of unemployed has reached more than 7 million, accounting for about 10% of the civilian labor force."

The magazine also pointed out that, due to the impact of the economic crisis, many young people who were supposed to graduate and leave school this year are willing to stay in school. In addition, there are many older workers and women who could have looked for work, but are now forced to "retire" from the labor force, and the U.S. government has not included these people in the unemployment figures.

Workers Sell Blood, Bosses Suck Blood

In Detroit, the industrial center of the United States with a population of 1.8 million, the number of unemployed has reached 300,000. The lives of unemployed workers are very difficult. Especially those who can no longer receive unemployment benefits after their term expires are facing desperation. Many people are forced to rely on selling their own blood to make ends meet.

According to a report in the September 14th issue of the American "Worker's Weekly," in front of a blood collection station of the "Midwest Blood Service Company" in Detroit, many unemployed workers line up early every morning to sell blood. The person in charge of this collection station said gleefully: "The economic crisis is getting more and more serious, people are in urgent need of money, so we are very busy."

These capitalists who trade in human blood are so mad as to drive down the purchase price and then sell it at a high price, thereby making huge profits. The purchase price of a pint of blood is only $5.50, but hospitals charge $25 per pint for blood transfusions to patients. American capitalists have not even let go of the opportunity to exploit the blood sold by workers.

Rats Infest Slums

According to the American "Worker's Weekly," Muskegon, located on the shores of Lake Michigan, has always been a famous tourist destination for wealthy Americans to enjoy themselves. But in the worker's residential area in a remote corner of the other end of this bustling city, rats are rampant. According to the city's housing inspector, a large number of hungry rats invaded homes, forcing residents to take turns sleeping and guarding their sleeping children at night to avoid being bitten by rats. More than 500 houses in this area have been in disrepair for many years, and according to the standards of the City Health Bureau, they are "unfit for human habitation." The gutters in a sloping two-story building are filled with dirt, and the water pipes, which have not been changed for more than 50 years, are leaking all the time. An inspector pointed out: "This area is infested with rats, the largest of which are 14 inches long." A police officer also said that an infant nearby had his ears bitten off and his wrists scratched by rats not long ago, and died of illness.

Labor and mass organizations in Muskegon are launching a struggle, demanding that the city authorities eliminate slums and improve workers' living conditions.

Black Family Sleeps on the Street

According to a report in the "New York Post" on September 17, this March, the New York City Housing Authority evicted the Atkins family and 226 other households from the Housing Authority's houses on the pretext of being "unwelcome." Atkins used to work in the transportation department, but lost his job due to a hand injury. Later, he repeatedly requested help from the city welfare department, and only then did he get a small room where four children could barely sleep at night, while the adults had to sit and doze all night. But now they can't even keep this small room, and the city welfare department wants to take back their housing. The "New York Post" said that although Atkins wanted to change his career and learn a craft, whether he would be able to find a job in the future is a big question. In order to protest against the city government authorities that caused their predicament, the six members of the Atkins family have now moved to sleep in front of the City Housing Authority.

### 美国人民的苦难

    美国人民的苦难
    失业人数知多少
    目前美国的失业人数究竟有多少？美国政府发表的官方材料说，
  7月份美国失业人数为五百三十万人，但这是大大缩小的数字，实际上的失业情况要严重得多。
    据美国“劳工研究协会”出版的9月号“经济扎记”指出，如果将许多每周仅能找到数小时工作的大量半失业者折成失业者，至少应在官方的失业数字再加上一百五十万，这样，“实际失业人数已达七百多万，约占平民劳动力的10％”。
    这家杂志还指出，由于经济危机的影响，今年许多该毕业离校的青年情愿留在校内。另外，还有许多本来可以寻找工作，但是目前被迫从劳动队伍“退休”的年龄较大的工人和妇女，美国政府也未将这些人计算在失业人数之内。
  工人卖血　老板吸血
    在拥有一百八十万人口的美国工业中心的底特律市，失业人数已高达三十万人。失业工人的生活十分困苦。特别是那些因期满而不能再领取失业救济金的人更面临绝境。许多人被迫依靠出卖自己的鲜血以勉强糊口。
    据9月14日美国“工人周报”报道，在底特律市一家“中西部血液服务公司”的一个血液收购站门前，每天大清早就有很多失业工人排队等候卖血。这个收购站的负责人幸灾乐祸地说：“经济危机日益严重，人们急需用钱，我们也就十分忙碌”。
    这些做人血生意的资本家竟丧心病狂地压低收购价格，然后以高价出售，从而获取巨额利润。一品脱血液收购价格仅五点五美元，但是医院对病人输血，每品脱却收费二十五美元。美国资本家连工人卖的血液也没有放过剥削机会。
  老鼠充斥贫民窟
    据美国“工人周报”报道，位于密执安湖滨的马斯凯根城，历来是美国富豪们享乐的著名游览胜地。可是就在这个繁华城市另一头的偏僻角落的工人住宅区里，老鼠却成群为患。据这个城市的房屋检查员说，大批饥饿的老鼠侵入住宅，迫使居民夜晚不得不轮流睡觉、守护睡熟的孩子，以免被老鼠咬伤。这个区的五百余所房子都已年久失修，按照市卫生局标准，都“不适宜人类居住”。在一座倾斜的两层楼房的阴沟里塞满污物，五十多年未换的水管时刻漏水。一位检查员指着说：“这一带老鼠充斥，最大的有十四英寸长。”一位警察也说，附近有一个婴孩不久前被老鼠咬掉耳朵和抓破手腕，不治死了。
    马斯凯根城的劳工和群众组织正展开斗争，要求市当局消灭贫民窟，改善工人居住条件。
  黑人家庭露宿街头
    据9月17日“纽约邮报”报道，今年3月间，纽约市房产局以“不受欢迎”的借口，将黑人阿金斯一家及其他二百二十六家住户，逐出房产局的房子。阿金斯原在运输部门工作，因手受伤而失去职业。后来他向市福利部门不断请求帮助，才得到了一间晚上勉强可以睡下四个孩子的小房间，而大人只好整夜坐着打盹。可是现在他们连这个小房间也保不住了，市福利部门要收回他们的住房。“纽约邮报”说，阿金斯虽想改行学手艺，但是将来能否找到职业，大成问题。为了向造成他们这种困难处境的市政府当局表示抗议，现在阿金斯一家六口搬到市房产局门前露宿。（龙）（附图片）
