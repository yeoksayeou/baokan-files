To His Excellency Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

	On this festive occasion, we cannot but recall with pleasure and satisfaction the development of the close and lasting friendship between our two governments and peoples, which has been beneficial to both of us. The many things we have in common and the increasing understanding and friendly cooperation between our two peoples greatly enhance the prospects for further consolidating our friendship, which in turn will enable us, jointly or separately, to make a greater contribution to the cause of world peace.

	U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma
