Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan has expressed dissatisfaction with an editorial in the American "New York Times" advocating that Chiang Kai-shek's troops withdraw from Jinmen and Mazu.

The "New York Times," one of the leading newspapers of the American ruling group, published an editorial on the 16th, advocating that the Chiang Kai-shek group withdraw from Kinmen and Matsu, and then the United States should strengthen Taiwan's military strength and try to bring some Pacific countries together to jointly "guarantee" the United States' long-term occupation of Taiwan.

This "New York Times" editorial has aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek group's "Foreign Ministry" spokesman, Jiang Yisheng, openly opposed the "New York Times" proposal at a press conference on the 17th. He said, "We believe the 'New York Times' is wrong." He reiterated that the Chiang Kai-shek group is unwilling to hand over the coastal islands. On the morning of the same day, Chiang Kai-shek met with McGregor, the "New York Times" reporter in Taipei. Afterwards, McGregor said that Chiang Kai-shek asked him in the conversation to write to the president of his newspaper, explaining the Chiang Kai-shek group's opposition.

A senior official of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Ministry of National Defense" commented on the "New York Times" editorial on the 17th, saying that for the Kuomintang in Taiwan, the retreat from the coastal islands "would be unthinkable."

The "New York Times" editorial stated, "As long as the Chinese Communist regime continues to rule mainland China, Jinmen Island and Mazu Island should be handed over to the Chinese Communists. These islands should be handed over in this way because (1) historically and geographically, these islands have always been part of the mainland; (2) these islands are of no use to Chiang Kai-shek except for offensive purposes; (3) these islands are close to the Chinese mainland almost like Staten Island is close to the American mainland, and as long as they continue to be controlled by an openly hostile government—the Chiang Kai-shek regime—it will be impossible to maintain a truly stable situation and eliminate what President Eisenhower called ‘a thorn in the side of peace.’"

### 美报主张蒋军撤出金马  蒋介石集团表示极不满

    美报主张蒋军撤出金马
    蒋介石集团表示极不满
    新华社18日讯　台湾蒋介石集团对美国“纽约时报”社论主张蒋介石军队撤出金、马一事，表示不满。
    美国统治集团的首要报纸之一“纽约时报”16日发表社论，主张蒋介石集团撤出金门、马祖，然后由美国加强台湾的军力并设法把太平洋一些国家拉在一起来共同“保障”美国长期霸占台湾。
      “纽约时报”这篇社论在台湾蒋介石集团中间引起了强烈的不满。蒋介石集团“外交部”发言人江易生17日在记者招待会上公开表示反对“纽约时报”的主张。他说，“我们认为‘纽约时报’是错误的。”他重申蒋介石集团不愿意交出沿海岛屿。同一天上午，蒋介石接见了“纽约时报”在台北的记者麦格雷戈，事后麦格雷戈说，蒋介石在谈话里要求他写信给他的报社的社长，说明蒋介石集团的反对意见。
    蒋介石集团“国防部”的一个高级官员17日对“纽约时报”的社论发表意见说，对台湾国民党来说，撤退沿海岛屿“将是不堪设想的”。
    “纽约时报”的这篇社论说，“只要中国共产党政权在中国大陆上继续执政，金门岛和马祖岛就应当移交给中国共产党。这些岛屿之所以应当这样移交，是（一）因为从历史上和地理上来说，这些岛屿一向是大陆的一部分；（二）因为这些岛屿除了进攻的目的以外，对蒋介石毫无用处；（三）因为这些岛屿靠近中国大陆几乎就像斯塔腾岛靠近美国大陆一样，只要它们继续掌握在一个公然敌对的政府——蒋介石政权手中，就不可能维持真正稳定的局势和消除艾森豪威尔总统所说的‘和平身上的一根芒刺’。”
