Developments in Literary and Art Theory Research

    Shaanxi Province Formulates a “Five-Year Plan for Literary and Art Theory Scientific Research”

    The five-year plan includes seven research projects: Research on the Party's literary and art policies; research on major issues raised in creative practice; research on national folk literature and art; special research; linguistics; research on the history of literature and art; and research on advanced experiences. It includes a total of fifty-two major topics and proposes the following specific measures:

    (1) All associations should pay attention to expanding the ranks of literary and art theory, vigorously cultivate new forces, carry out mass-based commentary work, and establish commentary groups in factories, rural areas, government agencies, schools, and literary and art organizations.

    (2) Hold regular creative discussion meetings, concentrate efforts, and solve the urgent problems existing in creation in a relatively thorough way.

    (3) Utilize literary and art publications, adopt forms such as written discussions and symposiums, discuss the outstanding works of writers in the region, and suggest that literary and art publications open up a "Everyone Talks" style forum to launch mass-based airing of views and debates, so that the work of critics and mass commentary can be closely integrated.

    (4) Mobilize theoretical workers to draw up detailed personal research plans and supervise their implementation.

    (5) Collect and sort out various materials around theoretical research to serve the research work.

    Art Scientific Research Work in Henan Province

    (1) Henan Province has now established an Art Institute, which will specialize in art scientific research and art education.

    (2) The work of opera research is the responsibility of the provincial Drama Program Work Committee. The current state of research is that it is preliminarily planned to write about the historical origins and musical materials of various local opera genres in the province, and some people are preparing to write "A History of Henan Opera," which is planned to be completed this year.

    (3) The Henan Yu Opera Theater and other theaters and troupes are separately responsible for the research work of Yu Opera and other opera genres, and have already published materials such as musical scores for Yu Opera and Qu Opera.

    (4) At present, many people's communes in Henan Province have established Red and Expert Universities, and many Red and Expert Universities have drama departments, such as the art department of the Zhaiquan (Mengjin County) Red and Expert University (as reported by "People's Daily"); some people's communes have also established Red and Expert Art Institutes, such as the Youth Red and Expert Art Institute established in Guocun Township, Shangqiu County, and the Drama Research Institute and Literary and Art Farm established in Chenliuzhen, Kaifeng County. These are all amateur art organizations run by the masses, and they are actively cultivating artists from the working people.
