    Writing about Oneself, Acting as Oneself
    Shanghai Film Studio Produces a Batch of New Feature Films Reflecting the Great Leap Forward

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai Film Studio has produced a batch of new feature films reflecting heroic figures and heroic deeds in the current Great Leap Forward, which have been released in various places around the National Day.

    These new feature films are a new form in film art, rapidly reflecting the rich and vivid scenes of the Great Leap Forward on all fronts, and the characters and stories depicted are all real people and real events. The films released this time, such as "Steel Men and Iron Horses," "Love the Factory as Home," "Giant Waves," "Huang Baomei," "Heroes Catch Up with Parker," "Revolution in Twenty Days," and "Little Masters in the Great Leap Forward," all depict new people and new events familiar to the people of Shanghai. In order to achieve better artistic effects, the films have made appropriate cuts to objective facts. Some not only have realistic portrayals but also romantic ideals; some films feature workers and farmers on the screen, acting as themselves. For example, the film depicting the communist spirit of Huang Baomei, a nationally renowned model worker and textile worker, features the original team on screen. Some films have some roles played by the masses themselves and some roles played by actors. For example, "Heroes Catch Up with Parker," which depicts the Hero brand gold pen of the China Fuhua Gold Pen Factory catching up with the American Parker gold pen in quality within twenty-five days, and "Steel Men and Iron Horses," are completely acted by actors.

    In the process of creating these films, the mass line of running films by the whole people has been implemented. Many scripts are created collectively. Not only inside the film studio, but all kinds of staff such as screenwriters, directors, actors, and administrative staff are writing scripts, and many cadres and masses from production units are also participating in the creation of film scripts. The script of "Huang Baomei" was collectively written by the Party Committee members and Propaganda Minister of the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17, Huang Baomei, and the twenty-odd female workers in her group, along with the screenwriters, directors, and factory directors of Tianma Film Studio, through multiple discussions and revisions. The romantic scene in the film, where all the textile industrial equipment is fully automated and electrified, and the textile workers become fairies, was proposed by the Party Committee and factory director of the State-owned Cotton Mill No. 17. In the past, it generally took more than a year from writing the script to completing the production of a feature film, but now many films are completed in two or three months.

    The benefit of doing so is that film creation can keep up with the pace of the times more quickly, and film workers can directly delve into life, labor together with workers and peasants, and create together in the creative process, which is conducive to them transforming and improving their thinking, enriching life experience, and is also of great benefit to creating excellent feature films in the future.

    This year, the three film studios in Shanghai, Tianma, Jiangnan, and Haiyan, will shoot about thirty such new feature films in total.

### 自己写自己　自己演自己  上影摄制一批反映大跃进的新艺术片

    自己写自己　自己演自己
    上影摄制一批反映大跃进的新艺术片
    本报讯　上海电影制片公司摄制的一批反映当前大跃进中英雄人物和英雄事迹的新艺术片，国庆节前后已在各地上映。
    这些新艺术片是电影艺术中的一个新形式，它迅速反映当前各条战线上丰富生动的大跃进面貌，而且表现的人物和故事都是真有其人，实有其事。这次上映的“钢人铁马”、“爱厂如家”、“巨浪”、“黄宝妹”、“英雄赶派克”、“二十天革个命”、“大跃进中的小主人”等影片，所表现的就都是上海人民所熟知的新人新事。影片为了获得更好的艺术效果，对客观事实作了适当的剪裁，有的不但有现实的描绘，还有浪漫主义的理想；有的影片是工人农民上银幕，自己演自己。如表现全国著名劳动模范、纺织女工黄宝妹的共产主义风格的影片，就是原班人马上银幕。有的影片部分角色由群众自演，部分角色由演员扮演。如描写华孚金笔厂英雄牌金笔质量二十五天内赶上美国派克金笔的“英雄赶派克”等。还有“钢人铁马”等影片是完全由演员演的。
    这些影片的创作过程中，贯彻了全民办电影的群众路线的方针。许多剧本都是集体创作出来的。不仅电影制片厂内部，编剧、导演、演员、行政人员等各种工作人员都动手写剧本，许多生产单位的干部和群众也参加了电影剧本的创作。“黄宝妹”的剧本就是由国棉十七厂党委委员、宣传部长、黄宝妹和她小组里的二十几个女工，同天马电影制片厂的编剧、导演、厂长等经过多次讨论和修改集体写成的。影片最后纺织工业设备全部自动化、电气化、纺织女工变成仙女的浪漫主义镜头就是国棉十七厂党委和厂长提出的。过去一部艺术片从写剧本到摄制完毕，一般都要一年以上，而现在许多影片在二、三个月内就完成了。
    这样做的好处是，电影创作能比较迅速地跟上时代的步伐，而且电影工作者在创作过程中，直接深入生活，与工农群众同劳动，共创作，有利于他们改造和提高自己的思想，丰富生活经验，对今后创作优秀故事片也有很大好处。
    今年上海的天马、江南、海燕三个电影制片厂，总共要拍摄三十部左右这样的新艺术片。
