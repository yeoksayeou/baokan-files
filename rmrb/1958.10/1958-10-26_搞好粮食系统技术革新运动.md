    Promote Technical Innovation Movement in the Grain System
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    With the development of the great leap forward in agricultural production, grain production is increasing more and more, and the work of grain storage, transportation, and processing is also becoming more and more burdensome. In the past, every year grain procurement and collection and transportation required the mobilization of hundreds of millions of rural laborers; the masses of farmers themselves also spent a lot of labor processing their own rations. This year's grain production has increased many times over, and more labor will be required. Under the circumstances of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture and the extreme shortage of labor, how can we transport and store the grain produced by the hard work of the masses in a timely manner? It now seems that there are two methods: one is to widely mobilize the masses to participate in this work, and the other is to further carry out the technical innovation movement.
    In the past year, on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement, the grain department has implemented the principle of putting politics in command, and in accordance with the principle of serving production and serving the masses, has widely carried out the technical innovation movement in grain work, and has already achieved significant results. For example, many grain units have achieved indigenous mechanization and semi-indigenous mechanization, shortening the grain delivery time, speeding up the warehousing progress, and saving labor. Jiangxi Nanchang County has saved more than 530,000 farmer labor days due to the creation and use of warehousing machinery. There have also been many innovations in the reform of grain processing tools.
    However, it should be made clear that this is only a beginning. There are still some problems that need to be solved in order to further carry out this movement. At present, the technical innovation movement is developing unevenly between regions, units, and business links. The vast majority of regions and units have actively taken action, but some regions and units have not done a good job in carrying out the movement because some comrades believe that the equipment conditions are poor and the cadres' cultural level is low. This understanding is wrong. Many regions, especially grassroots grain units, although they do not have modern equipment and the cultural level of cadres is not high, have already created miracles. The Tanghui District Grain Management Office in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, had simple equipment and lacked materials, but all the staff worked hard and diligently, looking for substitutes, and after six days and nights of hard work, finally realized the mechanization of grain warehouses and the automation of steamed grain and grain supply. According to the statistics of the creators of more than 390 kinds of tools in the grain department of Yunnan Province, those with primary school education accounted for 60%, those with junior high school education accounted for 30%, and there was only one college student. This fully shows that whether or not technical innovation can be carried out and whether or not achievements can be made does not depend on the quality of the equipment and the level of education, but on whether or not one dares to think and dare to act.
    Another major problem in the current technical innovation movement in the grain department is the lack of widespread promotion of new creations and inventions. There are various reasons for the formation of this situation, but the main reason is ideological. Some comrades believe that only their own innovations are innovations, and do not recognize other people's inventions and creations, let alone promote other people's inventions and creations; some comrades only want to engage in "foreign," "large," and complete sets, and do not want to engage in "indigenous," "small," and bit-by-bit innovations; although they have also created some indigenous machinery that uses wind and water power, they still pin their hopes on tomorrow's electricity and are unwilling to promote it immediately. These ideas not only hinder the promotion of technical innovation achievements, but also affect the widespread and in-depth development of the technical innovation movement to a certain extent. They do not understand that the purpose of carrying out technical innovation is to improve work, support production, and facilitate the masses. All new technical reforms that meet this requirement, no matter who the inventor is, should be actively promoted. Here, we must oppose any kind of chauvinism and individualism in the competition for medals. In the technical innovation movement of the grain department, we must resolutely implement the policy of combining "indigenous" and "foreign," with "indigenous" as the main focus. We must adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and vigorously promote existing technical achievements. Any idea that despises "indigenous" methods, does not actively use local raw materials, only wants to engage in "foreign" methods, and only wants to ask the leading organs for steel and power is detrimental to the work.
    Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line are the fundamental methods for carrying out the technical innovation movement. However, at present, in the technical innovation movement in the grain department, some units have not fully mobilized the masses, but have placed the task of technical innovation on a few technicians. Obviously, this approach is wrong. The strength and wisdom of the masses are infinite, and as long as the masses are mobilized, any work can be successful and any difficulty can be overcome. Therefore, to carry out technical innovation, we must believe in the masses, let go and mobilize the masses, and mobilize the strength of all personnel.
    At present, the new situation of the realization of people's communes in rural areas has put forward new tasks for the technical innovation movement in the grain department. The grain department must not only take good care of the state's grain and oil, but also help the people's communes take good care of the grain and oil, so as to ensure that the results of the leap forward in agricultural production are not lost. This requires the grain department to quickly overcome the shortcomings existing in the current technical innovation movement, thoroughly emancipate the mind, and push the technical innovation movement to a new climax.

    搞好粮食系统技术革新运动
    本报评论员
    随着农业生产大跃进的发展，粮食增产越来越多，粮食的保管、运输、加工等工作也越来越繁重。过去每年粮食征购、集运，都要动员数以亿计的农村劳动力；农民群众自己加工口粮，也要花费大量的劳动。今年粮食成倍地增产，所需的劳力将更多。在工农业同时并举、劳动力异常紧张的情况下，怎样才能把群众千辛万苦生产出来的粮食及时运送好并保管好呢？现在看来有两个方法：一个是广泛地发动群众来参加这一工作，另一个是进一步开展技术革新运动。
    一年来，粮食部门在整风运动取得胜利的基础上，实行政治挂帅，根据为生产服务、为群众服务的方针，广泛开展了粮食工作上的技术革新运动，并且已经取得了重大的成绩。例如，不少粮食单位实现了土机械化和半土机械化，缩短了交粮时间，加快了入库进度，节省了劳动力。江西南昌县由于创造和使用入库机械，全县可节约农民劳动日五十三万多个。在粮食加工工具的改革方面，也有许多创造。
    但是，应该说清，这还只是一个开端。要把这个运动进一步开展起来，还有一些问题需要解决。目前技术革新运动在地区间、单位间和业务环节间发展不平衡。绝大部分地区和单位都积极地行动起来了，但有的地区和单位，由于某些同志认为设备条件差、干部文化水平低，因而没有很好地去开展运动。这种认识是不对的。不少地区，特别是基层粮食单位，虽没有现代化的设备，干部的文化程度也并不高，可是已经创造了奇迹。浙江省嘉兴县塘汇区粮食管理所，设备简陋、材料缺乏，但是全所职工苦学苦钻，寻找代用品，经过六昼夜的苦战，终于实现了粮仓机械化，蒸谷、粮食供应自动化。云南省粮食部门，根据三百九十多种工具的创造人统计，小学文化程度的占60％，初中文化程度的占30％，大学生只有一人。这充分地说明：技术革新能否开展，能否取得成就，并不决定于设备好坏和文化程度高低，而在于敢不敢想，敢不敢干。
    当前粮食部门技术革新运动中的另一个重大问题，是没有广泛地推广新的创造发明。这种情况的形成，有各种各样的原因，但主要是思想问题。有的同志认为只有自己的革新才算革新，不承认别人的发明创造，更不愿推广别人的发明创造；有的同志只想搞“洋”的、“大”的和成套的，不想搞“土”的、“小”的和点点滴滴的；他们虽然也创造了一些利用风力、水力的土机械，但仍把希望寄托在明天的电力上，不愿意马上推广。这些思想不仅阻碍了技术革新成就的推广，而且在一定程度上影响了技术革新运动广泛深入地开展。他们不了解，开展技术革新的目的，是为了改进工作，支援生产，便利群众，一切合乎这个要求的新的技术改革，无论创造发明人是谁，都应该积极地加以推广。在这里，我们要反对任何锦标主义和个人主义的想法和做法。在粮食部门的技术革新运动中，必须坚决贯彻“土”“洋”并举，以“土”为主的方针。要因地制宜，就地取材，大力推广现有的技术成就。任何轻视“土”办法，不积极利用当地原材料，只想搞“洋”的，只想向领导机关要钢材、要动力的思想，对工作都是不利的。
    相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，是开展技术革新运动的根本方法。但是，目前在粮食部门的技术革新运动中，有些单位还没有把群众充分地发动起来，而把技术革新的任务放在少数几个技术人员的身上。显然，这种做法是不对的。群众的力量和智慧是无穷无尽的，只要群众发动起来，任何工作都可以取得成就，任何困难都可以克服。因此，搞技术革新，必须相信群众，放手发动群众，把一切人员的力量都调动起来。
    目前，农村实现人民公社化的新形势，向粮食部门的技术革新运动提出了新的任务。粮食部门不但要把国家的粮油保管好，而且要帮助人民公社把粮油保管好，保证农业生产的跃进成果不受损失。这就要求粮食部门迅速地克服当前技术革新运动中存在的缺点，彻底解放思想，把技术革新运动推向新的高潮。全国粮食系统技术革新展览会上展出的小巧玲珑的小麦脱皮机新华社记者　邹健东、雪印摄
