Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 28th: The Chinese film "Dong Cunrui" has been warmly welcomed by Baghdad audiences. This is the first Chinese film to be shown in Baghdad. The Chinese film "Dong Cunrui" began showing in Baghdad on the 27th. Shortly after noon, viewers came in a steady stream, and many people could not buy tickets. During the screening, cheers were constant, and sometimes the dialogue in the film could not be heard. Although the film only had simple Arabic and English explanations, the audience was able to understand the plot from the heart. People began to love Dong Cunrui from the very first few shots, because these shots clearly showed Dong Cunrui's character.

Chen Zhifang, the Chinese Ambassador to Baghdad, and other officials of the embassy watched the film. Ambassador Chen Zhifang received a very warm welcome from the thousands of people gathered outside the cinema. More and more people waited outside until the ambassador came out again. They surrounded Ambassador Chen, and shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Qasim!" "Long live the friendship between the two countries!" The masses inside and outside the cinema also shouted "Liberate Taiwan" in Chinese. The enthusiastic people were so crowded that it was difficult for Ambassador Chen Zhifang and the officials to get out of the crowd.

It is reported that the income from the first screening of this Chinese film will be given to the Iraqi People's Resistance Forces. The commander of the People's Resistance Forces also attended the screening of the film.

    英雄形象越关山　中伊人民心连心
    “董存瑞”激动了巴格达
    新华社巴格达28日电　中国影片“董存瑞”受到巴格达观众的热烈欢迎。这是在巴格达放映的第一部中国影片。中国影片“董存瑞”从27日起开始在巴格达放映。从中午过后不久，观众就源源而来，还有许多人没有买到票。在放映的时候，欢呼声一直不断，有时连影片中的对话都听不见。虽然影片只有简单的阿拉伯文和英文的说明，但是观众能够从内心了解这部影片的情节。人们从最初的几个镜头起，就开始热爱董存瑞，因为这些镜头清楚地显示了董存瑞的性格。
    中国驻巴格达大使陈志方和大使馆的其他官员观看了这部影片。陈志方大使受到群集在电影院外面的成千的人非常热烈的欢迎，越来越多的人们在外面等着，一直到大使再度出来。他们包围着陈大使，并且高呼“毛泽东万岁！”“卡塞姆万岁！”“两国友谊万岁！”在电影院里面和外面的群众还用中文高呼“解放台湾”。热情的人们是这样拥挤，以致陈志方大使和官员们很难从群众中走出来。
    据悉，这部中国影片第一次放映的收入将给伊拉克人民抵抗部队。人民抵抗部队司令也出席观看了这部影片。
