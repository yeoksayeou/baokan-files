Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 25th: Speech by Lin Boqu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, at the First Session of the First People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on October 25th. Excerpts are as follows:

Comrades, Delegates:

    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, after nearly two years of deliberation, consultation, and preparation, is officially established today. This is a great joyous event for the Hui people and the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, and it is also a common joyous event for the people of all ethnic groups in the country. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, I would like to extend warm congratulations to all the delegates, to the Hui people, and to the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region. The Hui people are one of the more populous and economically and culturally developed ethnic minorities in our country. The Hui people live scattered throughout the country, but are more concentrated in Ningxia and other places. Like other ethnic groups, the Hui people are a hardworking and brave nation, and have made glorious contributions to the founding of our great motherland. In history, the reactionary ruling classes of both the Hui and Han nationalities cruelly exploited and oppressed the Hui people, and the Kuomintang reactionaries even fundamentally refused to recognize the Hui people as a nation. From the very first day of its birth, the Communist Party of China, based on the principle of national equality, recognized the Hui people as a minority ethnic group in our country, and has made unremitting struggles for the liberation and development of the Hui people. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Party established autonomous regions for the Hui people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and organized and led the anti-Japanese struggles of the Hui people in various places. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party again led the Hui people in their struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and supported and participated in the national people's liberation war. After liberation, the Party abolished the system of national oppression throughout the country and realized national equality. On the one hand, it conscientiously guaranteed the equal rights of the Hui people living in mixed and scattered communities throughout the country, and continued to promote national regional autonomy in areas where the Hui people lived in concentrated communities, successively establishing four Hui autonomous prefectures and nine Hui autonomous counties, and one autonomous county jointly with other ethnic groups, in Ningxia, Gansu, and other places. On the other hand, it actively led the Hui people in carrying out democratic revolution and socialist revolution, cultivated cadres, developed the economy and culture, and improved and raised the people's living standards, thereby fundamentally changing the social outlook of the Hui people. The friendly and united relations between the Hui people and the Han people and other ethnic groups have also been further consolidated and developed. In the spring of 1956, the Party Central Committee proposed to establish a national autonomous region equivalent to a province for the Hui people, in order to satisfy the long-standing desire of the Hui people. Under the kind care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of Gansu Province and other fraternal regions, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was finally established. This is another major victory for our Party's ethnic policy and is worthy of celebration and encouragement by all of us.

    The basic policy of our Party in solving the national question is to implement national regional autonomy. In recent years, the work of promoting national regional autonomy has achieved great success. Thirty-five minority ethnic groups have implemented regional autonomy nationwide, with a total population of more than 25 million, accounting for more than 90% of the population of concentrated minority ethnic groups. The national regional autonomy policy fully conforms to the actual situation in our country and the common aspirations of all ethnic groups, and is a key to solving our country's national question. The fact that national regional autonomy is implemented among the Hui people fully proves the great superiority of this policy. Because Hui autonomous regions of different sizes have been established in places where Hui people live in concentrated communities, not only has the right of the Hui people to be masters of their own affairs in managing their internal affairs been guaranteed, greatly arousing their enthusiasm and initiative in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland, but also the historical divisions between the Hui and Han nationalities and other nationalities have been quickly eliminated, and mutual trust and unity among the nationalities have been enhanced. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will surely inspire greater revolutionary enthusiasm among the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, and will be conducive to the cause of socialist construction and the strengthening of national unity.

    Under the leadership of the Party, Ningxia region has made great achievements in its work in recent years. Democratic reform and socialist transformation have been carried out, and the socialist economic and cultural construction has been developed; in the rectification campaign and socialist education movement that began last year, localism, local nationalism and bourgeois individualism were criticized, and great victories were achieved in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Starting this year, under the favorable situation of the overall leap forward in socialist construction across the country, Ningxia's industrial and agricultural production has developed even more, with grain increasing by more than double compared to last year, and more than 9,000 large and small industrial units being built. Recently, the extreme right-wing elements of the Islamic community Ma Zhenwu, who were cloaked in religious garb, were struggled against, and a struggle against bad people and bad deeds in religious circles was launched, further liberating the Hui people politically and ideologically. People's communes have also been basically realized in the rural areas of the Autonomous Region. All of these have laid a good foundation for the construction work of the Autonomous Region in the future. At the same time, the Autonomous Region has fertile land and abundant products, and there are many extremely favorable conditions for construction work. The whole region has 4.7 million mu of paddy fields, with an average of more than two mu per person. After the completion of the Qingtongxia Reservoir project, the irrigated area can be expanded by several million mu. People often say, "The Yellow River enriches Ningxia," which refers to this place. According to preliminary exploration, there are dozens of kinds of mineral resources in the region, among which coal and petroleum reserves are the most abundant, and there is great potential for industrial development. The transportation in the Autonomous Region is also very convenient. All counties and cities have highways. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway running through the Autonomous Region has been opened to traffic, and the Beijing-Baotou-Yinchuan-Lanzhou air route has also been established. Therefore, after the establishment of the Autonomous Region, as long as it can fully rely on the masses under the leadership of the Party, it will surely be able to develop the socialist construction cause of the Autonomous Region at a high speed, and it will surely be able to open up a bright and brilliant future for the Autonomous Region.

    The comrades of the Autonomous Region have put forward that the most prominent problem encountered in the overall leap forward in socialist construction is the lack of labor force, and they have asked the Central Committee to provide support in this regard. In order to meet this requirement of the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, the Central Committee has agreed to draw a batch of labor force from other provinces in the next few years to support the construction work of the Autonomous Region. This is an important measure related to the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region and the high-speed development of socialist construction, and it is also a manifestation of the great unity and great collaboration of all ethnic groups in the great leap forward in socialist construction in our country. The realization of this measure will surely further accelerate the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region, and will have a far-reaching impact on the entire face of the Autonomous Region.

    Now, our country is in a great historical period of accelerating socialist construction and actively preparing conditions for the transition to a communist society. For all ethnic groups, communist society will be a society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" with highly developed production and culture, extremely abundant social products, and extremely noble moral qualities of the people. In this society, there will be no differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor, and the differences between all ethnic groups will gradually disappear and merge into a whole. At present, the situation in our country, from the perspective of national relations, is also in a historical period in which all ethnic groups are developing and prospering together on the basis of socialism, and are actively preparing conditions for the integration of all ethnic groups on the basis of communism. Because with the forward development of the socialist revolution and the great leap forward in socialist construction and the victory of the people's commune movement, the contact between the people of all ethnic groups in our country is becoming more and more frequent, the connections are becoming closer and closer, the people of all ethnic groups are working and living together, helping each other, and learning from each other within the same people's commune, and the cooperative relations between ethnic regions and between people's communes are being universally formed and greatly developed, thereby making the commonality and integration factors between ethnic groups more and more, the differences less and less, and the psychological remnants of national estrangement left over from history will eventually tend to disappear. The great Lenin once said: "The purpose of socialism is not only to eliminate the phenomenon of mankind being divided into many small countries and any state of isolation between ethnic groups, not only to make ethnic groups help each other and be close, but to make ethnic groups merge into one." Of course, to achieve the complete integration of all ethnic groups, it is necessary to go through the long-term efforts of the people of all ethnic groups. Because the integration of nationalities is the result of the high development and prosperity of the economy and culture of all nationalities on the socialist road. Without the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups on the socialist road, there can be no future common integration of all ethnic groups. Only after the common development and common prosperity of all ethnic groups and after the realization of communism can this integration be gradually achieved. However, now in our country, in the socialist revolution and the great leap forward in socialist construction, the general trend of all ethnic groups is to gradually move towards integration. The people of all ethnic groups in our country should adopt a welcoming attitude towards this trend and actively promote it.

    The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in such a great period of overall leap forward in socialist construction and great development of national relations has important significance, and at the same time assumes a glorious responsibility. What is the task of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region after its establishment? Its task is to unite the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, implement the Party's general line of building socialism, and while thoroughly completing the socialist revolution and consolidating the people's commune system, actively carry out technical and cultural revolution, accelerate the overall leap forward in socialist construction, strive to completely change the face of the Autonomous Region in the shortest possible time, continuously improve and raise the people's material and cultural life, and contribute the greatest strength to the socialist and communist construction of the motherland.

    The leadership of the Party is the decisive condition for the victory of our revolutionary and construction cause, and for the liberation, development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. Any work, whether it is revolutionary work or construction work, will inevitably lose its direction and lead to failure without the leadership of the Party; any ethnic group cannot be liberated, developed and prospered without the leadership of the Party. The Hui people's road to liberation and development and the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are also the result of the Party's leadership. Therefore, after the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the leadership of the Party must be further strengthened. Any unit and any work must be placed under the unified leadership and strict supervision of the Party. All Party cadres, whether they are Hui or Han cadres, local or outside cadres, new or old cadres, must be communized, must be measured by communist standards, and must be united on the basis of communist principles. Only in this way can the Party's leadership over the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region be implemented, and can the various tasks of the Autonomous Region be smoothly developed.

    The great unity and great cooperation between ethnic groups are the basic guarantees for building socialism. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was established on the basis of the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia region, mainly the Hui and Han nationalities. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region, this relationship of unity and cooperation between ethnic groups must be further strengthened and consolidated, and the unity between the various people's communes, between the various ethnic regions, and with fraternal neighboring regions must be further strengthened, and the socialist and communist spirit of great unity and great cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups must be promoted. On the basis of the great unity of the working people of all ethnic groups, the work of uniting and transforming the upper strata of all ethnic groups must continue to be strengthened.

    The mass line is the fundamental line of the Party in all its work. The Party's general line of building socialism is also the implementation and application of the Party's mass line in the cause of socialist construction. Only by believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses can we do a good job in revolutionary and construction work. Therefore, after the establishment of the Autonomous Region, the mass line must be thoroughly implemented in all kinds of work under the leadership of the Party. Big blooming, big contending, big debates, and big-character posters are the best ways for socialist mass movements and must be fully utilized.

    In order to accelerate the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region and actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism, in order to consolidate and develop the socialist national relations that have been established by the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region, we must continuously struggle against bourgeois nationalism, and at present, we should still focus on struggling against local nationalist tendencies. For this reason, we must continue to strengthen socialist and communist education for the broad masses of cadres and people, and arm cadres and people with the Marxist-Leninist world outlook and national outlook. We must take the people's commune as a school for carrying out the most vivid national unity education for the people of all ethnic groups, carry out education on the communist world outlook and national outlook for members of all ethnic groups at any time and any place, constantly struggle against bourgeois nationalist tendencies or other capitalist remnants, and overcome various narrow national viewpoints.

    When celebrating the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, we should not forget that US imperialism is extremely hateful of all the achievements and victories won by the people of all ethnic groups in our country. For several years, it has been occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, and in recent months, it has been creating tensions in the Taiwan Strait, constantly infringing on our country's territorial waters and airspace. This frenzied war provocation has seriously threatened peace in the Far East and the world. The people of all ethnic groups in our country must unite more closely, be vigilant at all times, defeat any provocation by US imperialism, and wage a resolute struggle for the liberation of Taiwan and other coastal islands, for safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland, and for defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    Comrades, Delegates: We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will further unite, gloriously shoulder the various tasks assigned to them by the Party and the state, and make the greatest efforts for the construction of the Autonomous Region and the common socialist construction cause of the people of all ethnic groups in the great motherland, and contribute all their strength to supporting the liberation of Taiwan and other coastal islands.

    加强民族团结　建设社会主义
    林伯渠在宁夏回族自治区首届人代大会上的讲话
    新华社银川25日电　中共中央政治局委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠10月25日在宁夏回族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上的讲话。摘要如下：各位代表、各位同志：
    宁夏回族自治区经过将近两年的酝酿、协商和筹备，今天正式宣告成立了。这是回族人民和自治区内各民族人民的一件大喜事，也是全国各民族人民的一件共同的喜事。我谨代表中国共产党中央委员会、中央人民政府和毛主席，向各位代表、向回族人民和自治区内各民族人民致以热烈的祝贺。回族是我国少数民族中人口比较多，经济、文化比较发展的一个民族。回族人民分散居住在全国各地，而以宁夏等地比较集中。回族和其他民族一样，是我国勤劳、勇敢的民族，对我们伟大祖国的缔造有过光荣的贡献。在历史上，回、汉两族的反动统治阶级曾经对回族人民进行了残酷的剥削和压迫，国民党反动派甚至根本不承认回族是一个民族。中国共产党从它诞生的第一天起，就根据民族平等的原则，承认回族是我国的一个少数民族，并且曾经为回族人民的解放和发展进行了不懈的斗争。在抗日战争时期，党就在陕甘宁边区为回族人民建立了自治地方，并且组织和领导了各地方的回族人民的抗日斗争。在第三次国内革命战争时期，党又领导回族人民进行了反对国民党反动派的斗争，支援和参加了全国人民的解放战争。解放以后，党在全国范围内废除了民族压迫制度，实现了民族平等。一方面认真保障了全国各地杂居、散居的回族人民的平等权利，继续在回族人民聚居的地方推行了民族区域自治，先后在宁夏、甘肃等地建立了四个回族自治州和九个回族自治县、一个和其他民族联合的自治县；另一方面积极领导回族人民进行了民主革命和社会主义革命，培养了干部，发展了经济和文化，改善和提高了人民的生活，从而使回族的社会面貌发生了根本的变化。回族同汉族及其他民族间的友爱团结关系，也获得了进一步的巩固和发展。1956年春天，党中央又倡议为回族人民建立一个相当于省一级的民族自治地方，以满足回族人民多年来的愿望。在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下，在甘肃省和其他兄弟地区的大力支持下，宁夏回族自治区终于建立起来了。这是我们党的民族政策的又一个重大的胜利，是值得我们大家欢欣鼓舞的。
    我们党解决民族问题的基本政策是实行民族区域自治。几年来，推行民族区域自治的工作已经获得了巨大的成绩。全国实行区域自治的已经有三十五个少数民族，人口共达二千五百多万，约占聚居的少数民族人口的90％以上。民族区域自治政策完全符合我国的实际情况和各民族的共同愿望，是解决我国民族问题的一把钥匙。在回族中推行民族区域自治的事实，就充分证明了这个政策的巨大优越性。由于在各地回民聚居的地方依据聚居地方的大小分别建立了大小不同的回族自治地方，不但保障了回族人民在管理本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利，大大激发了他们参加祖国社会主义建设的积极性和主动精神，而且迅速消除了历史上残留下来的回族和汉族及其他民族间的隔阂，增进了各民族间的互相信任和团结。毫无疑问，宁夏回族自治区的成立，一定会鼓舞起自治区内各民族人民更大的革命干劲，有利于社会主义建设事业和增强民族团结。
    宁夏地区在党的领导下，几年来工作有很大成绩。进行了民主改革和社会主义改造，发展了社会主义的经济、文化建设事业；在去年开始的整风和社会主义教育运动中，批判了地方主义、地方民族主义和资产阶级个人主义，取得了政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利。今年开始，在全国社会主义建设全面大跃进的有利形势下，宁夏工农业生产有了更大的发展，粮食比去年增加一倍多，兴建大小工业单位九千多个。最近又斗争了披着宗教外衣的伊斯兰教界极右分子马震武，开展了反对宗教界的坏人坏事的斗争，使回族人民在政治上、思想上获得了进一步的解放。自治区农村也已基本上实现了人民公社化。所有这些，都为自治区今后的建设工作打下了良好的基础。同时，自治区土地肥沃、物产丰富，在建设工作上有许多极为有利的条件。全区现有水田四百七十万亩，平均每人两亩多，青铜峡水库工程建成后，还可扩大灌溉面积几百万亩。人们常说：“天下黄河富宁夏”，就是指的这个地方。区内矿产资源据初步勘探就有几十种，其中尤以煤和石油蕴藏量最为丰富，发展工业的潜力很大。自治区的交通也很便利，所有县、市都有公路，横贯自治区的包兰铁路已经通车，京——包——银——兰航空线也已建立。因此，自治区成立以后，只要能够在党的领导下，充分依靠群众，就一定能够使自治区的社会主义建设事业高速度地发展起来，就一定能够为自治区开拓出光辉灿烂的前途。
    自治区的同志提出，在社会主义建设全面大跃进中遇到的一个最突出的问题是劳动力缺乏，并且要求中央在这方面给以支援。为了满足自治区各民族人民的这个要求，中央同意在今后几年内从其他各省抽调一批劳动力来支援自治区的建设工作。这是一个关系到自治区内各民族团结合作和社会主义建设高速度发展的重要措施，也是在我国社会主义建设大跃进中各民族大团结，大协作的表现。这一措施的实现，必将进一步加速自治区的社会主义建设，对整个自治区的面貌将会发生深远的影响。
    现在，我国正处在一个加速社会主义建设，并且为过渡到共产主义社会积极准备条件的伟大历史时期。共产主义社会对于各族人民说来，将是一个生产和文化高度发展、社会产品极为丰富、人们的道德品质极为高尚的“各尽所能、各取所需”的社会，在这个社会里将没有工农差别、城乡差别和脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，而各民族之间的差别也将逐渐消失，融合为一个整体。目前我国的形势，从民族关系方面来说，也就是正处在一个各民族在社会主义基础上共同发展和共同繁荣，并为各民族在共产主义基础上融合为一体而积极准备条件的历史时期。因为随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设大跃进的向前发展和人民公社运动的胜利，我国各民族人民之间的接触愈来愈多，联系愈来愈密切，各民族人民在同一人民公社内部共同劳动、共同生活、互相帮助、互相学习，以及各民族地区之间和各人民公社之间的协作关系正在普遍形成和大大发展，从而使各民族之间的共同性和融合的因素愈来愈多，差别性愈来愈少，历史遗留下来的民族隔阂的心理残余将会最后趋于消灭。伟大的列宁曾经说过：“社会主义的目的不只是要消灭人类分为许多小国家的现象和各民族间的任何隔离状态，不只是要使各民族互助亲近，而是要使各民族融为一体。”当然，要达到各民族的完全融合，还必须经过各民族人民的长期努力。因为民族的融合，是各民族在社会主义道路上经济、文化高度发展和繁荣的结果。没有各民族在社会主义道路上的共同发展和共同繁荣，就不可能有将来各民族的共同融合。只有经过各民族的共同发展和共同繁荣并在实现了共产主义之后，才能逐步达到这种融合。但是，现在我国在社会主义革命和社会主义建设大跃进中，各民族总的趋向是逐步走向融合。对这种趋向，我国各民族人民应该采取欢迎的态度，并且积极加以促进。
    宁夏回族自治区在这样一个社会主义建设全面大跃进和民族关系大发展的伟大时期成立，具有重要的意义，同时也承担了光荣的责任。宁夏回族自治区成立以后，它的任务是什么呢？它的任务就是要团结自治区内各民族人民，贯彻实现党的建设社会主义总路线，在彻底完成社会主义革命和巩固人民公社制度的同时，积极进行技术和文化革命，加速实现社会主义建设全面大跃进，争取在最短期间彻底改变自治区的面貌，不断改善和提高人民的物质文化生活，并为祖国的社会主义和共产主义建设贡献出最大的力量。
    党的领导是我们革命和建设事业获得胜利，各民族获得解放、发展和繁荣的决定条件。任何工作，不管是革命工作或是建设工作，离开党的领导，就必然迷失方向，导致失败；任何民族，离开党的领导就不可能获得解放、发展和繁荣。回族人民走上解放和发展的道路以及宁夏回族自治区的成立，也正是党领导的结果。因此，宁夏回族自治区成立以后，必须进一步加强党的领导。任何单位、任何工作都必须置于党的统一领导和严格监督之下。所有党的干部，不论是回族干部或汉族干部，本地干部或外来干部，新干部或老干部，都必须共产主义化，都必须用共产主义的标准来衡量，都必须在共产主义的原则基础上团结起来。只有这样，才能贯彻实现党对自治区各民族人民的领导，才能使自治区的各项工作得到顺利的发展。
    民族之间的大团结、大协作，是建设社会主义的基本保证。宁夏回族自治区是在宁夏地区各民族、主要是回、汉两族团结合作的基础上建立的。自治区成立以后，必须进一步加强和巩固民族之间的这种团结合作关系，进一步加强各人民公社之间、各民族地区之间以及同兄弟邻区之间的团结，发扬各民族人民大团结、大协作的社会主义和共产主义精神。在各民族劳动人民大团结的基础上，还必须继续加强对各民族上层人士的团结、改造工作。
    群众路线是党在一切工作中的根本路线。党的建设社会主义总路线也是党的群众路线在社会主义建设事业上的贯彻和运用。只有相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，才能搞好革命和建设工作。因此，自治区成立以后，必须在党的领导下，在各种工作中彻底贯彻群众路线。大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报是社会主义群众运动的最好方式，必须充分加以运用。
    为了加速自治区的社会主义建设，并且为过渡到共产主义积极准备条件，为了巩固和发展自治区各民族人民已经建立起来的社会主义的民族关系，必须不断地和资产阶级民族主义思想进行斗争，当前仍然应当着重和地方民族主义倾向进行斗争，为此就必须继续加强对广大干部和人民群众进行社会主义和共产主义教育，用马克思列宁主义的世界观和民族观来武装干部和人民。必须把人民公社作为向各民族人民进行最生动的民族团结教育的学校，随时随地对各民族社员进行共产主义世界观和民族观的教育，经常和资产阶级民族主义倾向或其他资本主义残余进行斗争，克服各种狭隘的民族观点。
    在庆祝宁夏回族自治区成立的时候，我们不应该忘记：美帝国主义对我国各族人民所获得的一切成就和胜利是极端仇恨的。几年来它一直霸占着我国的领土台湾，最近几个月来又在台湾海峡制造紧张局势，不断地侵犯我国的领海和领空。这种疯狂的战争挑衅，使远东和世界和平受到了严重的威胁。我国各民族人民必须更加紧密地团结起来，时刻提高警惕，击败美帝国主义的任何挑衅，为解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿，为维护祖国的主权和领土完整，为保卫远东和世界和平而进行坚决的斗争。
    各位代表、各位同志：我们完全相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，宁夏回族自治区的各民族人民一定会更进一步地团结起来，光荣地担负起党和国家所交给他们的各项任务，为自治区的建设和伟大祖国各民族人民共同的社会主义建设事业作出最大的努力，为支援解放台湾及其他沿海岛屿贡献出他们的全部力量。
