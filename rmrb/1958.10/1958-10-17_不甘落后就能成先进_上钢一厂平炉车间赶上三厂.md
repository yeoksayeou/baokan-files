Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1's Open Hearth Furnace Workshop Catches Up with Plant No. 3

(Our Shanghai dispatch, October 16) After failing to meet its production plan for three consecutive months, the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 strove for advancement in October and leaped to the production level of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3's open hearth furnace workshop, a national high-yield open hearth furnace banner. In the first fourteen days of October, the open hearth furnace workshop of Plant No. 1 had already completed 45.9% of its monthly steel production leap forward plan, with an average daily output increase of more than 81% compared to the previous month, and the utilization coefficient surged from 8-point-something in September to over 16.

This leap forward in the workshop after entering October provides a vivid example of lagging behind and then catching up rapidly. The leading personnel and the masses of workers in this workshop, starting from the second half of September, focused on loading more and refining faster, and made a series of improvements from leadership style and leadership methods to production technology organization. They first concentrated their efforts on solving two major problems: one was to improve equipment. Taking advantage of the furnace's intermediate repairs, they implemented eleven measures such as expanding the hearth and enlarging the checker openings (reducing waste gas resistance and increasing furnace temperature). The second was to vigorously engage in rapid steelmaking. The workshop cadres and the masses divided into two groups, one group set up a rapid steelmaking team to conduct research, and the other sent production backbones to the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 to learn. More importantly, there was a significant transformation in the organization and leadership of daily production. Starting at the end of September, the workshop leaders moved to the site to work. The dispatch room in the corner of the workshop became the office and dormitory of the workshop's Party general branch secretary and the workshop director. Previously, the workshop cadres looked at the production reports afterward, discovered problems, and summarized lessons. Now, they understand the production situation at any time, and solve problems on-site in a timely manner. The production plan has been grasped by the masses. The entire workshop has formed a new situation of leadership grasping, the masses grasping, shift grasping, and furnace grasping.

With the concerted efforts of the entire workshop, significant results have been achieved in loading more and refining faster. The output of each furnace of steel has increased by nearly ten tons, and the smelting time has been shortened by more than one hour compared to the past.

The workers in this workshop are striving to achieve an average utilization coefficient of 16 for the entire month of October, and with this as a condition, they are challenging the national high-yield open hearth furnace banner – the open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3. The open hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 immediately launched a "defend the red banner movement," further raising its indicators to challenge with the condition of achieving an average utilization coefficient of 17 for the entire month.

### 不甘落后就能成先进  上钢一厂平炉车间赶上三厂

    不甘落后就能成先进
    上钢一厂平炉车间赶上三厂
    本报上海16日电　连续三个月没有完成计划的上海第一钢铁厂平炉车间，10月份力争上游，一跃赶上了全国平炉高产红旗——上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间的生产水平。一厂平炉车间在10月份前十四天中，已完成全月钢产量跃进计划45.9％，平均日产量比上月增长了81％以上，利用系数由9月份的八点几猛增到十六以上。
    这个车间跨进10月后出现的这一飞跃，提供了一个落后猛赶先进的生动范例。这个车间的领导人员和工人群众一起，从9月下半月起，以多装快炼为中心，从领导作风、领导方法到生产技术组织作了一系列的改进。他们首先集中力量解决了两个重大问题：一是改进设备。利用炉子中修的机会，实行了扩大炉膛、放大格子孔（减少废气阻力、提高炉温）等十一项措施。二是大搞快速炼钢。车间干部和群众兵分两路，一面成立快速炼钢小组进行研究，一面派出生产骨干到上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间学习。更重要的是，日常生产组织领导有了极大的转变。从9月底开始，车间领导干部搬到现场办公。车间角落里的调度室，成了车间党总支书记和车间主任的办公室和宿舍。以前，车间干部都是事后看生产表报，发现问题，总结教训。现在是随时了解生产情况，有问题在现场及时解决。生产计划已经为群众所掌握。整个车间形成了领导抓、群众抓、班班抓、炉炉抓的新局面。
    全车间齐心努力，已在多装快炼方面取得显著成效。每炉钢产量增加了将近十吨，冶炼时间反比过去缩短了一小时多。
    这个车间的工人力争10月份全月平均利用系数达到十六，并以此为条件，向全国平炉高产红旗——上钢三厂平炉车间挑战。上钢三厂平炉车间也立即展开了“保红旗运动”，再度提高指标，以全月平均利用系数达到十七的条件应战。
