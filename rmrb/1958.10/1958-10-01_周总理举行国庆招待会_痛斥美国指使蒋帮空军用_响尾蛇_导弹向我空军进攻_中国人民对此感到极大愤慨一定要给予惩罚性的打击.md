Xinhua News Agency, September 30th. Premier Zhou Enlai, at the National Day reception held tonight, exposed the serious crime of US imperialism directing the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force to attack our Air Force with "Sidewinder" missiles supplied by the United States to guests from more than seventy countries and regions.

Premier Zhou solemnly warned, "The Chinese people will certainly give a punitive blow to the crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the direction of the United States. The Chinese people feel extreme anger at the war provocations of US imperialism."

He said, "If the American aggressors disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and continue to carry out military provocations and expand aggression against our country, then the American aggressors will tighten the noose around their own necks and will not be able to escape."

Guests from more than seventy countries and regions from the world's five continents attended tonight's reception. The crowded banquet halls showed that the Chinese people have friends all over the world.

Premier Zhou emphatically pointed out at the grand reception, "Since the resumption of the Sino-US talks in Warsaw, the United States has continued to gather troops from Japan and other US military bases, constantly violating our territorial waters and airspace, and recently even directed the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force to attack our Air Force with 'Sidewinder' missiles supplied by the United States. All this shows that the United States is not seriously negotiating, but is repeatedly provoking incidents and expanding its aggression against our country. The problem is now very clear: the key to eliminating the tension and danger of war in the Taiwan Strait area is by no means the 'ceasefire' trick played by the United States. Instead the United States must immediately stop playing with fire and withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu and the waters of Taiwan."

The serious war threat of the American aggressors cannot scare the Chinese people. The powerful voice issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people aroused enthusiastic responses from Chinese and foreign guests, who expressed their support for the just struggle of the Chinese people with long applause.

At the beginning of the reception, Premier Zhou expressed a warm welcome to the guests from various countries. In his speech, he first talked about the situation of China's Great Leap Forward. The Premier announced to friends from various countries that various facts prove that "the schedule for our country to catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of industrial output will definitely be greatly shortened compared with the original estimates."

He said with full confidence that China "will not only be able to develop by leaps and bounds, but will certainly be able to gain the upper hand in the peaceful competition with imperialism."

This is good news for peace-loving people all over the world. Everyone at the venue was overjoyed and burst into thunderous applause.

At the grand reception, Albanian First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Baluku, Bulgarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chervenkov, North Korean Deputy Premier of the Cabinet, Li Zhouyuan, Romanian Military Delegation Leader General Salajan, and Mongolian Visiting Military Delegation Leader Lieutenant General Dorji, sat at the same round table with Premier Zhou Enlai and others. They had cordial conversations and frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to congratulate the unity and friendship of the people of the world.

Tonight, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai, He Long, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Luo Ronghuan, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Chen Shutong, and Cheng Qian, President Dong Biwu, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying and Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Burhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and others attended the reception. They joyfully drank and chatted with the guests.

Amid bursts of warm applause, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi raised their glasses and walked to the guests' seats, warmly toasting with the guests. They thanked the Soviet Union and the brotherly countries for their sincere assistance to our country's construction, expressed the sympathy and support of the Chinese people to the guests from Asia, Africa, and Latin America at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle, and mutually congratulated the victory of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with the guests from all countries. Wherever Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi went, the atmosphere was full of friendship and joy.

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi walked to the seats of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation and the Iraqi Cultural Delegation, the distinguished guests proposed a toast to the victory of China's anti-aggression struggle. Premier Zhou expressed his gratitude for the distinguished guests' congratulations. He said that the longer the US troops stay in Taiwan, the tighter the noose around its neck, and the closer the day of its death. Premier Zhou toasted the guests from the United Arab Republic for their victories and wished them greater victories. At the seat of the Latin American Legal Workers Delegation, a Colombian representative shouted "Long live China!" in newly learned Chinese. When Premier Zhou toasted him, he congratulated "Long live the Latin American people!" When a representative of the West African Railway Workers' Union expressed to Premier Zhou how excited he was to see China's great achievements, and how deeply he regretted that his nation was still suffering from colonial rule, Premier Zhou said that you will soon become independent, and all oppressed nations in the world will achieve independence.

When Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi met with student representatives from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the hall immediately erupted, and slogans and applause intertwined. These young friends chanted in unison in Chinese: "Long live peace!" "Liberate Taiwan!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" (Attached picture)

    周总理举行国庆招待会
    痛斥美国指使蒋帮空军用“响尾蛇”导弹向我空军进攻
    中国人民对此感到极大愤慨一定要给予惩罚性的打击
    新华社30日讯　周恩来总理今天晚上在他举行的国庆九周年招待会上，向来自七十多个国家和地区的来宾，揭露美帝国主义指使蒋介石空军用美国供给的“响尾蛇”导弹向我国空军进攻的严重罪行。
    周总理严重警告说：“中国人民对于蒋介石集团在美国指使下所犯的罪行，一定要给予惩罚性的打击。中国人民对于美国帝国主义的战争挑衅，感到极大的愤怒。”
    他说：“如果美国侵略者不顾中国人民的一再警告，继续对我国进行军事挑衅和扩大侵略，那么，美国侵略者就会使套在自己脖子上的绞索越拉越紧，无法逃脱。”
    出席今晚招待会的有来自世界五大洲七十多个国家和地区的来宾，三个宴会大厅里宾客济济，表明了中国人民的朋友遍于全世界。
    周总理在盛大的招待会上强调地指出，“自从中美会谈在华沙恢复以后，美国仍然继续从日本和其他美国军事基地调集兵力，不断侵犯我国的领海和领空，最近甚至指使蒋介石空军用美国供给的‘响尾蛇’导弹向我国空军进攻。这一切说明，美国不是在认真地谈判，而是一再挑起事件，扩大对我国的侵略。现在的问题很清楚，消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势和战争危险的关键，决不是美国所耍弄的‘停火’把戏，而是美国必须立即停止玩火，从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。”
    美国侵略者严重的战争威胁吓不倒中国人民。周恩来总理代表六亿中国人民发出的强有力的声音，激起了中外来宾热烈的反响，人们以长时间的掌声来表示支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    招待会开始时，周总理向各国来宾表示了热烈的欢迎之意。他在讲话中首先谈到了中国大跃进的情况，总理向各国朋友们宣布说，各种事实证明，“我国在工业产量方面赶上和超过主要资本主义国家的日程，一定会比原来估计的要大大缩短”。
    他满怀信心地说，中国“不但能够突飞猛进地发展，而且一定能够在同帝国主义的和平竞赛中取得优胜”。
    这是全世界爱好和平人民的福音，会场上人人欢欣鼓舞，不断地发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    在盛大的招待会上，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议第一副主席巴卢库，保加利亚部长会议副主席契尔文科夫，朝鲜内阁副首相李周渊，罗马尼亚军事代表团团长萨拉扬上将和蒙古访华军事代表团团长道尔吉中将，同周恩来总理等坐在一张圆桌上，他们在一起亲切交谈，频频举杯祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，祝贺世界人民的团结和友谊。
    今晚，彭德怀、贺龙、陈毅、李富春、李先念、聂荣臻、薄一波副总理，林伯渠、李济深、罗荣桓、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通、程潜副委员长，董必武院长，张鼎丞检察长，国防委员会叶剑英、张治中副主席，政协全国委员会包尔汉副主席，外交部张闻天副部长等，都出席了招待会。他们同客人们在一起欢畅地饮酒交谈。
    在一阵阵热烈欢迎的掌声中，周恩来总理和陈毅副总理举杯走到客人们的席位前面，同来宾们热烈碰杯，他们感谢苏联和各兄弟国家对我国建设的真诚援助，向来自反殖民主义斗争前线的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的客人们表示中国人民的同情和支持，并且和所有国家的来宾们互相祝贺和平共处五项原则的胜利。周总理和陈毅副总理走到哪里，哪里就充满友谊欢乐的气氛。
    周总理和陈毅副总理走到伊拉克人民友好访华代表团和伊拉克文化代表团的席前时，贵宾们提议为中国反侵略斗争取得胜利而干杯。周总理对贵宾们的祝贺表示感谢。他说，美国军队在台湾的时间越长，套在它脖子上的绞索就越紧，它死亡的日子就越近了。周总理同来自阿拉伯联合共和国的客人们一起为他们已经取得的胜利干杯，并且祝他们取得更大的胜利。在拉丁美洲法律工作者代表团的席前，一位哥伦比亚代表用刚学会的中国话喊起“中国万岁！”周总理同他碰杯时祝贺“拉丁美洲人民万岁！”当西非铁路工会的一位代表向周总理表示他看到中国的伟大成就是多么激动，同时又多么痛惜自己的民族还遭受着殖民主义统治的时候，周总理说，你们很快会独立起来，世界所有被压迫的民族都会取得独立。
    周恩来总理和陈毅副总理同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的学生代表们见面时，大厅里立时沸腾起来，口号声和掌声交织成一片，这些年青朋友用中国话齐声高呼：“和平万岁！”“解放台湾！”“毛主席万岁！”（附图片）
