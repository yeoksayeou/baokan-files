    Liucheng Creates Automatic Shifting Deep Plow
    Changxing Manufactures Pile-less Rope Traction Machine

    (Reported by this newspaper) On October 6th, workers at the Liucheng County Universal Machinery Factory in Guangxi successfully created an automatic shifting deep plow using rope traction. After testing, this plow proved to fully meet the requirements of automation. Using a side-by-side animal-powered rope traction machine, the plow does not require manual handling. Upon reaching the end of the field, it can automatically lift and shift, requiring no human operation, which can greatly improve work efficiency. The depth can reach about one foot. The quality of soil turning also meets agricultural production requirements: turning the topsoil without turning the subsoil, and all the soil clods are turned to one side. The plow column of the automatic shifting plow is movable and can swing twenty-five degrees forward and backward. When the rope is pulled forward, the front guide wheel touches the ground, the front plow blade enters the soil, and the rear plow blade and rear guide wheel are lifted off the ground. The opposite happens when pulling backward. Since the guide wheel is suspended before touching the ground again, the plow beam only needs to be slightly swung to the left or right to automatically shift. More than twenty people were present during the plow's trial, including cadres from the Regional Department of Agriculture, the Special District Party Committee and the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, the County Party Committee, the County People's Committee, and representatives from various places who came to Liucheng for a visit. Everyone unanimously praised that this plow truly solved a major problem in the automation of rope traction. This plow was created by Su Zhaolun, a technical cadre dispatched by the Liuzhou Prefectural Party Committee to assist the county in rope traction plowing, and Zhao Dechang, a technician from the factory, after working hard for three days and two nights. It is now being promoted throughout the Liuzhou Special District.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, has successfully trial-produced a pile-less rope traction machine.

    After visiting and learning about the Fengxian rope traction machine in Jiangsu, the Changxing County Party Committee's Agricultural Tool Reform Office working group immediately imitated and built a rope traction machine. During a plowing test, the visiting masses reflected, "This rope-drawn deep plow is good, but driving piles and moving it takes too much labor." It turned out that this type of rope traction machine required driving four wooden stakes, and it had to be moved after plowing thirteen rows, which was both labor-intensive and resource-consuming. The County Party Committee believed that the masses' opinions were correct and decided to further improve the rope traction machine. After the trial production working group and all the workers worked hard for four days and nights, they finally successfully trial-produced a pile-less rope traction machine.

    The main advantages of this pile-less rope traction machine are that it does not require pile driving, is easy to operate and move, and saves labor and materials. Originally, installing a rope traction machine and driving piles required at least one worker's labor, and it had to be moved after plowing thirteen rows. The pile-less rope traction machine only requires lengthening the chassis of the traction machine, using the front end of the chassis to support the field ridge, and pressing the back with a large stone weighing one hundred pounds to use. Moving it takes only a few minutes. The operation is also very simple and easy. It only takes four women to easily push it to plow to a depth of one foot.

    绳索牵引犁有新发展
    柳城创造自动移行深耕犁
    长兴制成无桩绳索牵引机
    本报讯　广西柳城县通用机械厂职工10月6日创造成功一架利用绳索牵引的自动移行深耕犁。这种犁经过试验，证明完全符合自动化的要求，犁用并立式畜力绳索牵引机，不用人扶，犁到田头能够自动起犁和移行，完全不用人操纵，可以大大提高工作效率；深度可达一尺左右。翻土质量也符合农业生产要求：翻表土不翻底土，土垡都倒向一边。自动移行犁的犁柱是活动的，可以前后摆动各二十五度。当绳索向前牵引时，前导轮着地，前犁头入土，后犁头与后导轮即翘离地面。向后牵引则相反。由于导轮悬空再着地，只要犁辕稍向左或右偏摆一些，就能自动移行。这架犁试验的时候，在场的有区农业厅、专区地委及农林水利局、县委、县人委干部及各地来柳城参观的代表二十多人，大家一致赞扬这架犁的确解决了绳索牵引自动化方面一个很大问题。这架犁是由柳州地委派到该县协助搞绳索牵引犁的技术干部苏肇伦同该厂技工赵德昌共同努力钻研下，经过三天两夜苦干创造出来的。现正在柳州专区全面推广。

    本报讯　浙江省长兴县试制成功了一种无桩绳索牵引机。
    长兴县委农具改革办公室工作组，在参观和学习了江苏奉贤绳索牵引机以后，当即仿造了一部绳索牵引机。进行耕地试验时，参观的群众反映说：“这种绳索牵引深耕犁好是好，就是打桩、移动花工太大。”原来这种绳索牵引机要打四个木桩，耕十三行就要移一次，既花工，又花料。县委认为群众意见很对，决定进一步改进绳索牵引机。经过试制工作组和全体工人苦战四昼夜，终于试制成功了一部无桩绳索牵引机。
    这种无桩绳索牵引机，主要优点是不要打桩，操作、移动方便，节省劳动力和木料。原来安装一只绳索牵引机打桩至少要花一工劳力，耕十三行就要移动一次。而无桩绳索牵引机，只要把牵引机底架改长，使盘底架前端支住田埂，后面用一块百斤大石头压住即可使用。移动一次只花几分钟。操作又很简便、轻快，耕深一尺只要四个妇女就可轻松地推动。
