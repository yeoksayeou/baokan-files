A magnificent wave of the entire population engaging in iron and steel production has swept many people onto the iron and steel production front. In Sichuan Province, "Women's Furnaces" and "Iron and Steel March 8th Women's Camps" have emerged. Women in Hunan have proposed: "Women hold up half the sky, strive to be first in everything." This is an unprecedented miracle in our country's history, demonstrating that women can not only participate in agriculture and light industry production, but also undertake heavy industrial production like steelmaking and ironmaking. Generally speaking, no one would openly oppose women participating in labor production anymore. However, there are still different views on what kind of production women can participate in. Some say, "Women's physical strength is not good enough, they can only engage in light industry, not heavy industry." "Steelmaking and ironmaking are too much for women." "Mining coal and digging ore are also not suitable for women"… This is not suitable, that is not suitable, setting many forbidden zones for women, preventing them from participating in various kinds of labor. This is essentially still underestimating women's power and viewing women with old, unequal eyes. Lenin pointed out in many articles: "If women are busy with housework, their status will inevitably be restricted. To completely liberate women and make them truly equal to men, there must be public economy and women must participate in common productive labor. Only in this way can women be on an equal footing with men." Here, Lenin's "participating in common productive labor" clearly includes heavy industrial labor. Therefore, while taking into account the physiological characteristics of women, women should be allowed to participate in common labor, including heavy industry, just like men. This is the correct approach to truly liberate women completely and achieve true gender equality.

As for whether women's physical strength can cope with heavy industrial labor? Facts have proven that they can. Li Dingshu, a young woman from Qifeng Township in Sichuan, was originally considered only a semi-labor force in the countryside. Once she joined the iron and steel front, she quickly became a versatile worker in mining, batching, and smelting. Qiu San'e from Daqiao Township in Hunan worked like a man on the ironmaking site, and her technical progress was also very rapid. Similar examples are numerous in various places. We should see that with the development of the technological revolution and the increasing advancement of science, the degree of mechanization and automation in heavy industrial production will become greater and greater in the future, and manual labor will be reduced to a minimum. Moreover, women's physical strength can be cultivated, and their physical strength has been and will be enhanced in labor. Therefore, the above concerns are completely superfluous.

Women are a powerful force in creating social culture and social wealth. Many of them possess a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. To correctly estimate the position and role of women in the cause of socialist construction, we should also break with conventions, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of old ideas that underestimate women, fully explore the labor potential of women, and let them, together with men, blossom brightly in the construction cause and in the field of culture and science.

    不可忽视的生力军
    规模壮阔的全民办钢铁的浪潮把许许多多的人都卷到钢铁生产战线上来了。四川省出现了“妇女炉”群和“钢铁三八妇女营”的组织，湖南妇女们提出：“妇女半边天，事事要争先”。这是我国历史上没有过的奇迹。说明妇女不但可以参加农业、轻工业生产，而且也可以担任炼钢炼铁的重工业生产。一般说来，妇女参加劳动生产，已经没有人会公开反对的了。但是对妇女参加什么样的生产，还有种种不同的看法。有人说：“妇女体力不行，只能搞轻工业，不能搞重工业。”“炼钢炼铁，妇女可吃不消。”“挖煤挖矿，妇女也不行”……这也不行，那也不行，给妇女划下了许多禁地，使她们不能参加各种各样的劳动，这实质上仍然是轻视妇女力量，以旧的不平等的眼光看待妇女的表现。列宁在许多文章里指出：“妇女要是忙于家务，她们的地位总不免要受到限制。要彻底解放妇女，要使她与男子真正平等，就必须有公共经济，必须让妇女参加共同的生产劳动。这样，妇女才会和男子处于平等地位。”这里，列宁所指的“参加共同的生产劳动”，显然是包括重工业劳动在内。因此，在照顾妇女生理特点的情况下，应该让妇女和男子一样，参加包括重工业在内的共同劳动，这才是真正使妇女彻底解放，做到真正男女平等的正确做法。
    至于妇女的体力能不能胜任重工业劳动？事实证明是可以胜任的。四川起凤乡的青年妇女李定书原来在农村里只算她是个半劳动力，一旦参加钢铁战线，很快成为开矿配料冶炼的多面手。湖南大桥乡的丘三娥在炼铁工地上同男人一样劳动，技术进步也很快。类似这样的事例，各地很多很多。我们应该看到，随着技术革命运动的发展，科学的日益发达，将来在重工业生产中机械化自动化程度会越来越增大，体力劳动越来越会减低到最小的限度。何况妇女的体力是可以培养的，她们的体力已经将会而且在劳动中增强起来。因此，上述的顾虑完全是多余的。
    妇女是创造社会文化和社会财富的一支强大力量，她们当中有不少的人是具有敢想敢说敢作敢为的共产主义风格的。正确估计妇女在社会主义建设事业中的地位和作用，也应打破清规戒律，彻底清除轻视妇女的旧思想残余，充分发掘妇女的劳动潜力，让她们和男子一起，在建设事业中、在文化科学领域里开放鲜艳的花朵。
