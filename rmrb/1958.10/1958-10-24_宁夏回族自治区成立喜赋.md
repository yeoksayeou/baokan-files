Ningxia, upstream of the Yellow River, first in tranquility, Dragon Head and Helan Mountains straddle, Ejin, Juyan, and Jade Sea lie horizontally, Jilan and Yanchi are even more priceless, the Great River alluvial plains are formed, the land north of the border and the land of abundance surprisingly mirror each other, wheat and rice yield abundantly like the southeast, cattle and sheep descend in droves in the northwest.

　　Yinchuan has been majestic since ancient times, leaning against the Great Wall to the north and bordering the river to the east, Shizuishan and Zhongwei are rich in wool and leather, Dingyuan's trade rubs shoulders, Lingwu governs ditches and furrows vertically and horizontally, the rivers and mountains embrace Pingluo, two million Hui and Han people live together, resting and recuperating forever without error. The reactionary rule regarded it as a pouch, deceiving and swindling wantonly, all rejoice in liberation for nearly ten years, people's lives are increasingly lively, living in a large family of six hundred million, dividing into autonomous regions and vast territories, all cheer for the wise leadership, the great national plan will never be forgotten.

　　Joyful news spreads from the west, just as the autumn is high and the air is crisp, a piece of paper travels and vibrates the mallet, diligently proclaiming the Party's virtue with a grand and extensive voice, Jinma, Taiwan and Penghu are full of troubles, uniting in hatred against the enemy,挟风雷, driving together the swift camels for a thousand miles, holding hands to destroy the stubborn enemy across the straits. Do not say that the northwest is full of dangers, the Baotou-Lanzhou railway connects Baotou and Yinchuan, guiding the river can also facilitate navigation, why use leather rafts to supply肥羜, human and material resources are brought into play together, developing resources without detail, the socialist future is good, production leaps forward in this sequence.

　　Happily sending congratulatory messages on the occasion of the establishment, returning autonomy is the foundation, the national policy is a great victory, the whole country rejoices in the spring scene, from now on the great unity of Hui and Han, responding to the call to show great promise, creating miracles on the general line, the red flag fluttering and flying in the western border!

    宁夏回族自治区成立喜赋
    李济深黄河上游首宁夏，龙首贺兰两山跨，额济居延玉海横，吉兰盐池更无价，大河冲积成平原，塞上天府交相讶，麦稻丰产美东南，西北戢戢牛羊下。
          　银川自古极嵯峨，北倚长城东带河，石嘴中卫饶毛革，定远贸易肩相摩，灵武纵横治沟洫，河山襟带推平罗，回汉共处二百万，休养生息永无讹。反动统治视瓯脱，尔虞我诈肆囊括，共喜解放近十年，人民生活日活泼，同居六亿大家庭，划分自治及辽阔，万众欢呼领导贤，民族大计长不沫。
          　遥传喜讯自西来，正值秋高气爽开，一纸风行振遒铎，勤宣党德声宏恢，金马台澎正多事，同仇御侮挟风雷，齐驱明驼千里足，挽手海峡顽敌摧。莫道西北多险阻，包兰路通包夏举，导河亦可利航行，何须皮筏供肥羜，人力物力齐发挥，开辟资源无细巨，社会主义好前程，生产飞跃循斯序。
          　欣值成立致贺词，归还自治此开基，民族政策大胜利，举国共喜春台熙，从兹回汉大团结，响应号召展猷为，总路线上创奇迹，红旗飘飘扬西陲！
