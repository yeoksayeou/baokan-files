Learning from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Chen Bochui

    Riding the Longhai Railway train, whether heading east or west, when passing through Luoyang, one can clearly see the new atmosphere of the industrial zone: towering chimneys, orderly factory buildings, dazzling red rooftops, surrounded by boundless green fields, the socialist construction scene is such a beautiful picture.

    If you take a night train through here, the lights in this area are even more fascinating. It is as if someone generously scattered countless night-shining pearls in the wilderness, permeating the night sky with a shimmering treasure, making the stars and crescent moon in the sky pale in comparison.

    Indeed, today, people coming to Luoyang are no longer preoccupied with the peonies in the Jin Valley Garden, or the Qiyun Pagoda next to the White Horse Temple, or even the Longmen Grottoes on the banks of the Yi River. Their hearts are drawn to the newly built factories standing in the western suburbs of the city.

    In the morning, I visited the ball bearing factory. As a writer, facing those tall, heavy, and powerful lathes and other machines, I felt even more ignorant. If it weren't for the comrade who was guiding me, explaining as we walked, looking at one cold, big fellow after another, I could only stare blankly.

    What catches the eye are those large and small steel balls – the rolling elements – flashing with bright, silvery light, looking truly lovely. I unconsciously recalled Bai Juyi's line of poetry, "Large pearls, small pearls falling on a jade plate." However, in the class-exploitative society of the feudal dynasty where "living in Chang'an is not easy," how could the poet have ever personally witnessed so many pearls, it was clearly just a fantasy. But in today's real life, I have indeed seen countless steel balls that could not be measured by cartloads, and their value far exceeds that of decorative pearls. They have the power to change the face of a social era!

    The comrade guiding me pointed to the female workers who were inspecting the steel balls and said, "In terms of precision, it almost needs to reach the same level as manufacturing measuring instruments. The sphericity deviation of the balls used for ultra-precision bearings cannot exceed one micron – one-thousandth of a millimeter. It's thinner than a hair!"

    Seeing the young female workers meticulously inspecting each process with extremely skilled techniques, one after another, an infinite feeling of respect welled up. Their cheerful and responsible work attitude showed that they all loved this kind of work and life.

    Ball bearings are known as the "soul of all machinery." Now, agricultural cooperatives across the country have issued the heroic call of "everyone smashes ball bearings, everyone grinds bearings," boldly reforming farm tools and welcoming the autumn harvest.

    The facts are clear: In one month, Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province established 793 ball bearing factories and manufactured 150,000 sets of ball bearings. Other provinces are also working at full speed to transform waterwheels, stone mills, handcarts, animal-powered vehicles, and even double-wheeled double-shared plows into semi-mechanized farm tools in a fiery technical revolution.

    As I finished writing this short article, I couldn't help but seriously think: Why do the workers and peasants dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and even think of making ball bearings with a Great Leap Forward spirit: big and small together, combining indigenous and foreign methods, walking on two legs, chasing after that "old British ox"? While demanding highly precise ball bearings to assemble cars, airplanes, and rockets, it's okay to equip less precise machinery with lower-grade ball bearings, materials don't need to be high-grade steel; equipment can also be simple and crude, not necessarily modern; people with poorer skills can also learn to trial-produce. Everything is improved from the basis of popularization. They have truly learned Marxism from labor training and production practice, and have implemented dialectical materialism into their work and life. But we intellectuals cannot do this. Because individualism is still deeply rooted, we do not "care about every pulse beat of the masses," we lack both political enthusiasm and our thinking stagnates in place, unable to break out of the "superstition" circle in the conservative kingdom. As a result, we become mystics towards science and technology; we become onlookers in the tide of the production upsurge initiated by industry and agriculture. How alarming and worthy of introspection!

    "In any work, we must implement the struggle of two lines," we have certainly learned the "theory of two points" in theory; but in the face of concrete things, we are still confused. And the wisdom and potential of the people are endless, and this ball bearing movement has added another example – an ironclad proof. I, not only appear to be lacking in knowledge, but most seriously and terrifyingly, my thinking is backward. I bow my head and take the workers, peasants, and soldiers as my teachers.

    以工农兵为师
    陈伯吹
    搭乘陇海铁路火车，不论往东、往西走，经过洛阳时，都能够清晰地望见一派新气象的工业区：高耸的烟筒，整齐的厂房，耀眼的红屋顶，四围衬着无边的绿野，社会主义建设图景竟是一幅这样美丽的图案画。
    如果坐夜车经过这里，那么，这一带的灯火，是更迷人的。仿佛谁慷慨地把无数夜明珠撒在旷野里，在夜空下弥漫着一片珠光宝气，叫天上的繁星、弦月，黯然失色。
    可不是，今天来到洛阳的人，已经心不在焉那金谷园里的牡丹，或者白马寺旁的齐云塔，甚至于伊水之滨的龙门古迹了。心向往之的是屹立在市区西郊的新建的工厂。
    早晨，我去参观了轴承厂。作为一个拿笔杆的人，面对着那些高大的、沉重的、有力的车床和其他机器，显得知识更加贫乏了。如果没有招待同志带领着边走边讲，独个儿瞧着一台又一台冷冰冰的大家伙，那只能瞠目凝视了。
    引人注目的是那些作为滚动体的大大小小的钢球——滚珠，闪出亮晶晶的银色的光辉，看来真是可爱。我不知不觉地联想起白居易的诗句“大珠小珠落玉盘”来。然而在“长安居，大不易”的封建王朝的阶级剥削社会里，诗人何尝亲眼目睹过那么多的珍珠，显然只是幻想罢了。可是在今天现实生活里，我的的确确看到了多得不可能以车载斗量的钢珠，而且它的价值远远地超过了作为装饰用的珍珠。它力能改变一个社会时代的面貌呢！
    招待同志指着正在检验钢球的女工们又说：“在精密度方面，几乎要达到相当于制造量具检验仪器一样的高度。那超精级轴承滚动体用的滚珠，它们圆度的偏差，不能超过一公忽——一公厘的千分之一。比一根头发还细！”
    看到青年女工正在以极其熟练的技术，迅速地一道接着一道工序严格地检验着时，涌起了无限钦敬的心情。从愉快负责的工作态度上，显出她们都是热爱着这样的工作和生活。
    滚珠轴承号称“一切机械的灵魂”。现在，全国各农业社都发出了“人人砸滚珠，个个磨轴承”的豪迈声音，大胆地起来改革农具，迎接秋季大丰收。
    事实摆得明明白白：安徽省阜阳专区就在一个月里建立了七百九十三个滚珠轴承工厂，同时制造出十五万套滚珠轴承。其他各省也是一样地快马加鞭，把那些水车、石磨、手推车、畜力运载车辆，甚至双轮双铧犁，都在热火朝天的技术革命干劲下，一下子被“脱胎换骨”地成了半机械化的农具了。
    当我写完了这篇短文，不能不严肃地想一想：为什么工农群众敢想、敢说、敢做，竟会想到制造滚珠轴承也可以来个大跃进：大小齐来，土洋并举，用两条腿走路，直追那条“老英牛”。在要求有精密度极高的滚珠轴承来装配汽车、飞机、火箭的同时，不妨对那些不太精密的机械，装配较低级的滚珠轴承，材料不需要高级钢；设备也可以因陋就简，非一定现代化不可；技术较差的人，也可以学习试制生产。一切都从普及的基础上提高。他们是从劳动锻炼、生产实践中，真正学会了马克思主义，把辩证唯物论贯彻到工作生活里去。而我们这些知识分子却不能够这样。由于个人主义还根深蒂固，不“关心群众每一脉搏跳动”，既缺乏政治热情，思想又在原地踏步，走不出保守王国里的“迷信”圈子。以致对科学技术成为神秘论者；对工农业掀起的生产高潮成为观潮派中的旁观者。是多么值得警惕猛省啊！
    “在任何工作中都要贯彻两条路线的斗争”，在理论上固然学习了“两点论”；可是在具体事物面前，仍然稀里糊涂。而人民的智慧和潜力无穷无尽，在这一次滚珠轴承化运动上又多了一个事例——一个铁证。我，不仅显得知识贫乏，最严重可怕的还是思想落后。低下头来，以工农兵为师。
