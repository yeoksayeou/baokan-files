A word from everyone:

    Let's Twirl the Yangko
    Feng Liping, Xi'an Normal College

    I saw the Yangko again!
    In the National Day parade in Yan'an, there were children from Nanguan Elementary School, and young men and women from Yan'an Normal School. They were all dressed so beautifully, and they all twirled so lively and happily. Watching, watching, I couldn't help but smile; it was as if I had returned to nine years ago, when I danced with red ribbons in the Yangko team. Celebrating festivals, paying New Year's visits to the families of revolutionary martyrs, and going to the countryside to do propaganda, all required the Yangko team. From sensible children to seventy-year-old grandmothers, they all embodied their excited feelings, their respect for the families of revolutionary martyrs, and their love for a happy life in this joyful twist and jump. How could this scene be forgotten?
    No force can sever my feelings for Yangko. However, I haven't twirled the Yangko for five or six years; I've lived in the city for a few years, and I rarely see Yangko. It is said that Yangko is a low-level art with nothing to see; some even say it is uncomfortable to watch. As a result, in some areas of Guanzhong, especially in big cities like Xi'an, Yangko has been neglected, and the prosperous scene at the time of the initial liberation has gradually become deserted.
    The people have not forgotten Yangko. Farmers often ask us: Why don't you twirl the Yangko anymore?
    The people love Yangko. Yangko is the art of the people. In today's socialist construction, with the all-round Great Leap Forward, especially the Great Leap Forward in culture, the status of Yangko should be restored.
    Let's twirl the Yangko! If large cities like Beijing and Xi'an also had hundreds and thousands of Yangko teams in the festive parades, just like Yan'an, what kind of atmosphere would it be? If in the cities and villages across the country, Yangko teams could be seen everywhere, just like at the time of the initial liberation, what kind of atmosphere would it be?

### 扭起秧歌来

    扭起秧歌来
    西安师范学院　冯力平
    我又看到秧歌了！
    在延安庆祝国庆节的游行队伍中，有南关小学的小孩子，也有延安师范的青年男女们，他们都打扮得那样好看，都扭得那样活泼、愉快。看着，看着，我禁不住笑了；仿佛回到了九年前，那时，我在秧歌队里舞动过红绸。庆祝节日，给烈军属拜年，到农村宣传，都少不了秧歌队。从懂事的娃娃到七十岁的老太婆，都把他们兴奋的心情、对烈军属的尊敬、对幸福生活的热爱，体现在这欢乐的一扭一跳中。这情景难道能够忘记么？
    没有什么力量能割断我和秧歌的感情。但是，我已经有五六年没有扭过秧歌了；在城市住了几年，也很少看到过秧歌。据说，秧歌是一种低级的艺术，没有什么看头；甚至有人说看着不舒服。于是，在关中某些地区、特别是像西安那样的大城市，秧歌受到了冷遇，初解放时那种兴盛景象就逐渐冷落了。
    人民群众没有忘记秧歌。农民常常问我们：你们怎么不扭秧歌了？
    人民群众热爱秧歌。秧歌是人民群众的艺术。在社会主义建设全面大跃进、特别是文化大跃进的今天，应该恢复秧歌的地位。
    扭起秧歌来！如果像北京、西安这样的大城市，也和延安一样，节日的游行队伍中有上百上千的秧歌队，那将会是怎样的一种气氛呢？如果在全国的城市和农村，都像初解放时一样，时时处处可以看到秧歌队，那又将是怎样一种气氛呢？
