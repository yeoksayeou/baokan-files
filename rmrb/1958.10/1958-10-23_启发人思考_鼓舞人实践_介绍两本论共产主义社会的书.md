Inspiring Thought and Encouraging Practice
Introducing Two Books on Communist Society
Wei Xiong

    At a time when the people of the whole country are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the movement to communize people's communes, and the communist education movement is being widely carried out throughout the country, the books "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Communist Society" published by the People's Publishing House and "On Communist Communes" (Second Edition) published by the China People's University Press are worth studying.

    "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Communist Society" provides a relatively comprehensive introduction to the works and speeches of Marxist-Leninist classical writers on communist society. Due to the limitations of the era in which they lived, the founders of Marxism-Leninism could not leave ready-made formulas for all the details of the future communist society, but the principles of communist society formulated by them based on scientific communist thought are still applicable to us today. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, once combined with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, has given a completely new look to the Chinese revolution." ("Reform Our Study") Now, as the people of the whole country are accelerating socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm and gradually transitioning to communism, it is of more practical significance to seriously study the Marxist-Leninist principles of communism than at any time in the past.

    In this book, the editors have divided the main principles of communist society into twenty-five special topics, including "Overview of Communist Society," "Communist Labor," "Distribution and Consumption of Products, 'From Each According to His Ability, to Each According to His Needs'," "Equality and Average Issues," "Conditions for Transition to Communist Society," and the disappearance of differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between manual and mental labor. While discussing these issues, Marxist-Leninist classical writers also criticized various distortions and misunderstandings of communist society.

    In "Critique of the Gotha Program," Marx made a summary of communist society, saying: "In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life’s prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!" (Page 95 of this book) Based on China's specific conditions, our party has developed the Marxist theory on the conditions for communist society. The Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas pointed out six conditions for realizing communist society in China. When these conditions are met, our society will enter the communist era of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. The Marxist-Leninist theory on the conditions for realizing communist society shines like a lighthouse, pointing out the goals of our progress.

    In communist society, labor will become the primary need of people's lives. As Lenin pointed out, communist labor is unremunerated labor that benefits society, is voluntary labor, and is a natural need for a healthy body. This means that communist labor must be carried out on the basis of people having a high degree of communist political consciousness and moral character. Therefore, when we strive to accelerate socialist construction and promote the early realization of communism, we cannot but strengthen the communist ideological education of the people. The idea of unilaterally emphasizing "to each according to his needs" while intentionally or unintentionally ignoring "from each according to his ability" is actually a misunderstanding of communist society.

    Marxist-Leninists regard the complete elimination of bourgeois rights ideology as an important symbol of the realization of communist society. In the first stage of communist society—socialist society—bourgeois rights have been abolished in terms of the private ownership of the means of production, but they have not been completely overcome in terms of distribution. The existence of bourgeois rights remnants is unavoidable. As Marx pointed out, "Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby." (Page 95 of this book) Lenin wrote in "State and Revolution": "If we are not to indulge in utopianism, we must not assume that after the overthrow of capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any standard of right; indeed, the abolition of capitalism does not immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change." (Page 186 of this book)

    However, in the process of its own development, a socialist country never allows such bourgeois rights to be retained for a long time. On the contrary, it should gradually reduce its role and even completely eliminate the remnants of bourgeois rights in order to create conditions for the transition to communist society. Failing to see the objectivity of the remnants of bourgeois rights remaining in the transition period from capitalism to socialism, or failing to resolutely overcome the ideology of bourgeois rights in the process of socialist development, makes it impossible to fully understand the thorough elimination of bourgeois rights ideology among all the people today.

    The book "On Communist Communes" (Second Edition) has three parts. The first part is about the current people's commune movement in our country, the second part is excerpts from the works of Marxist-Leninist classical writers on communist society, and the third part is an introduction to the speculations and imaginations of European utopian socialists on the ideal society of the future. The end of the book also includes an index of relevant information on the recent people's commune movement in our country.

    Included in the first part of this book are excerpts from Comrade Mao Zedong's speeches on the people's commune issue, the instructions of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee on the people's communes, the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas, and editorials, reports, and articles on people's communes published in the People's Daily. These documents will make us deeply realize that "the people's commune is the inevitable trend of the development of the situation" (page 2 of this book), which marks a new stage in the development of the socialist revolution in our country. The people's communes, which were actively created by the masses on the basis of the improvement of communist consciousness, were quickly and widely established throughout the country under the advocacy of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. As pointed out in the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas, "Under the current situation, establishing people's communes that comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, side occupations, and fishery, and integrate industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, is the basic policy that must be adopted to guide the peasants to accelerate socialist construction, build socialism ahead of schedule, and gradually transition to communism." (Page 3 of this book)

    In merging big communities and transforming into communes, the struggle reflected in people's thinking still exists. Therefore, in the process of building communes, the struggle between the two roads should still be implemented, and the communist ideological education of the masses should be strengthened. The socialist democratic method of airing views, debates, and big-character posters created by our party must still be adopted when establishing people's communes. In this book, we see that the Chao Ying People's Commune, after airing views and debates, summarized the ten advantages of running people's communes, which is a very good proof. (Page 32 of this book)

    Practice has proved that the establishment of people's communes has created extremely favorable conditions for the further development of rural relations of production. The consolidation and development of people's communes makes it possible to eliminate the differences between rural and urban areas, between workers and peasants, and between manual and mental labor, and the realization of communist society in our country is no longer a distant future. Therefore, the current people's commune "will develop into the basic unit of the future communist society" (page 5 of this book).

    The second part of this book excerpts the remarks of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on communist society. This part has the same materials as those collected in the book "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Communist Society," but the quantity is smaller.

    The third part of this book collects comments and introductions to some European utopian socialists. European utopian socialists before the birth of Marxism appeared in the early period when the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie had not yet developed. They generally did not recognize the significance of the working class political movement, and especially abandoned all revolutionary actions of the working class. They did not find the correct way to realize their ideals, and their various claims were entirely utopian in nature. However, the speculations and imaginations of utopian socialists about the ideal society of the future did have positive significance at that time. Their criticism of the entire foundation of society at that time also provided valuable materials for enlightening workers' consciousness. Engels believed in "The Peasant War in Germany" that German socialist theory, "will never forget that it stood on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen." Utopians ingeniously foresaw many things, and these predictions can now be proved correct by scientific methods.

    Of course, the progressive significance of European utopian socialism has become smaller and smaller with the passage of time. After the birth of Marxism, the disciples of utopian socialists could only play a reactionary role in the process of the proletarian revolution. The third part of this book can be used as a critical reference when we study the issue of people's communes.

    启发人思考  鼓舞人实践
    介绍两本论共产主义社会的书维雄
    在当前全国人民正在欢欣鼓舞地投入人民公社化运动，以及共产主义教育运动正在全国范围内广泛地开展的时候，人民出版社出版的
  “马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论共产主义社会”和中国人民大学出版社出版的“论共产主义公社”（第二版）两本书，是值得大家学习的。
    “马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论共产主义社会”一书，比较全面地介绍了马克思列宁主义经典作家有关共产主义社会的著作和言论。马克思列宁主义的创始人，由于他们所处的时代限制，对于未来共产主义社会的全部细节还不可能留下现成的公式，但是他们根据科学共产主义思想所制定的共产主义社会的原理、原则，对于我们今天仍然是适用的。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“马克思列宁主义的普遍真理一经和中国革命的具体实践相结合，就使中国革命的面目为之一新。”（“改造我们的学习”）现在，当全国人民正以冲天干劲，加速社会主义的建设，逐步向共产主义过渡的时候，认真地学习马克思列宁主义关于共产主义的原理，比起过去任何一个时期来，都更加具有现实的意义。
    在这本书中，编者就共产主义社会的各个主要原则，分列了二十五个专题，其中包括“共产主义社会的概况”，“共产主义的劳动”，“生产品的分配和消费，‘各尽所能，各取所需’”，“平等和平均问题”，“向共产主义社会过渡的条件”，以及城乡之间、工农之间、体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别的消失等等问题。马克思列宁主义经典作家们在论述这些问题的同时，也批判了各色各样的对共产主义社会的歪曲和误解。
    马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中，曾经对共产主义社会作过概括的论述，他说：“在共产主义社会高级阶段上，当那奴役人们、迫使其服从社会分工的情形已经消失后；当智力劳动和体力劳动的对立已随之消失后；当劳动已经不单单是谋生的手段，而且本身已成为乐生的第一要素时；当生产力已随着每个人在各方面的发展而增高，一切公共财富泉源都尽量涌现出来时，——只有那时，才可把资产阶级式的法权的狭隘眼界完全克服，而社会就能在自己的旗帜上写着：各尽所能，各取所需！”（本书第九十五页）我们党根据我国的具体情况，发展了马克思主义关于共产主义社会的条件的学说。在中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中，指出了在我国实现共产主义社会的六个条件。实现这些条件，我国社会就将进入了各尽所能、各取所需的共产主义时代。马克思列宁主义关于实现共产主义社会的条件的学说，就像灯塔一样地指明了我们前进的目标。
    在共产主义社会里，劳动将成为人们生活的第一需要。诚如列宁所指出的，共产主义劳动是一种为社会造福的无报酬的劳动，是自愿的劳动，是健康身体的自然需要。这就意味着共产主义的劳动必须是在人们具有高度的共产主义政治觉悟和道德品质的基础上进行的。因此，当我们为加速社会主义的建设，促使共产主义早日实现而努力奋斗的时候，我们就不能不加强对人们的共产主义思想教育。那种片面地只强调“各取所需”而有意无意地忽视“各尽所能”的思想，实际上是对共产主义社会的误解。
    马克思列宁主义者把彻底消除资产阶级法权思想，看成是实现共产主义社会的重要标志。在共产主义社会的第一阶段——社会主义社会里，资产阶级法权在生产资料的私人占有方面是取消了，但是在分配等方面并没有完全克服。资产阶级法权残余的存在是不可避免的。正如马克思所指出的，“法权永不能超过社会经济制度以及由此经济制度所决定的社会文化发展程度。”（本书第九十五页）列宁在“国家和革命”一书中写道：“如果不愿陷入空想主义，那就不能认为，在推翻资本主义之后，人们立即就会不需要任何法规而为社会劳动，况且资本主义的废除，不能立即为这种变更创造经济前提。”（本书第一百八十六页）
    但是，社会主义国家，在其自身发展的过程中，决不是让这种资产阶级法权长期地保留下来，相反地，应该逐步缩小其作用，乃至彻底消除资产阶级法权的残余，以便为过渡到共产主义社会创造条件。看不到从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期中还遗留着资产阶级法权的残余的客观性，或者在社会主义发展的过程中不坚决地去克服资产阶级法权思想，就不可能对当前在全体人民中彻底破除资产阶级法权思想作出全面的理解。
    “论共产主义公社”（第二版）一书，共有三个部分，第一部分是有关我国当前人民公社化运动的资料，第二部分是马克思列宁主义经典作家有关共产主义社会的著作摘录，第三部分则是介绍欧洲空想社会主义者对未来理想社会的臆测和想像，书末还附有最近我国人民公社运动的有关资料的索引。
    选入本书第一部分的有毛泽东同志关于人民公社问题的言论摘录，中共中央政治局扩大会议关于人民公社的指示，中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议，以及人民日报发表的有关人民公社的社论、报道和文章。这些文件将使我们深切地体会到，“人民公社是形势发展的必然趋势”（本书第二页），它标志着我国的社会主义革命发展的一个新的阶段。群众在共产主义觉悟提高的基础上主动创造的人民公社，经过党中央和毛泽东同志的倡导，很快地便在全国范围内广泛建立起来了。诚如中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中指出的，“在目前形势下，建立农林牧副渔全面发展，工农商学兵互相结合的人民公社，是指导农民加速社会主义建设，提前建成社会主义并逐步过渡到共产主义所必须采取的基本方针。”（本书第三页）
    在并大社、转公社中，反映在人们思想上的斗争，仍然是存在的。因此，在建社的过程中，仍应贯彻两条道路的斗争，并应加强对群众进行共产主义思想的教育。我们党所创造的鸣放辩论这种社会主义的民主方式，在建立人民公社时仍然必须采用。在这本书中，我们所看到的超英人民公社，在鸣放辩论之后，就总结出了办人民公社的十大优越性，这就是一个很好的证明。（本书第三十二页）
    实践已经证明，人民公社的建立，已为农村生产关系的进一步发展，创造了极其有利的条件。人民公社的巩固和发展，使农村和城市、工人和农民、体力劳动和智力劳动之间的差别的消失成为可能，在我国实现共产主义社会已经不是什么遥远将来的事情了。因此，当前的人民公社，“将发展成为未来共产主义社会的基层单位”
  （本书第五页）。
    本书第二部分，摘录了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于共产主义社会的言论。这一部分和“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论共产主义社会”一书所收的材料相同，只是数量较少。
    本书第三部分，收集了对欧洲一些空想社会主义者的评述和介绍。马克思主义诞生前的欧洲空想社会主义者是在无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争尚未发展的最初时期出现的。他们一般都没有认识到工人阶级政治运动的意义，特别是抛弃了工人阶级的一切革命行动。他们没有找到实现自己理想的正确道路，他们的种种主张也全然是带有空想的性质的。但是，空想社会主义者对于未来理想社会的臆测和想像，在当时来说，确有积极意义。他们对当时社会全部基础的抨击，对于启发工人意识，也提供了宝贵的材料。恩格斯在“德国农民战争”中，认为德国的社会主义理论，“永远不会忘记它是站在圣西门、傅立叶和欧文的肩上的。”乌托邦主义者天才的预见到很多事情，这些预见现在已经可用科学方法来证明其正确了。
    当然，欧洲空想社会主义的进步意义，随着时间的增长就愈来愈小了。当马克思主义诞生以后，空想社会主义者的门徒们，在无产阶级革命的过程中，就只能起反动的作用。本书第三部分可以作为我们学习人民公社问题时批判参考之用。
