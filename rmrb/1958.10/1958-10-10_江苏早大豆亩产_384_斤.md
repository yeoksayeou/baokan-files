Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 9th. Jiangsu Province has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of early soybeans. Calculated at 42.5% for interplanted early soybeans, the actual area is 983,500 mu. Adding the 1,576,700 mu of sole-cropped early soybeans, the total area is 2,560,200 mu. The actual total output is 985,150,000 jin, with an average yield of 384.12 jin per mu. In Xuzhou Prefecture, the main soybean producing area, the yield reached 586 jin per mu, an increase of more than eight times compared to last year.

In recent years, although soybean production in Jiangsu Province has increased somewhat, the yield has remained around 100 jin per mu each year and has been very unstable. Therefore, many people regard soybeans as a "low-yield crop" and believe that it is difficult to increase production. Since the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of cadres and people have broken superstitions and resolved to remove the "low-yield" label from soybeans. Guanyun County first proposed the goal of achieving a soybean yield of 500 jin per mu, followed by the cities and counties of Pi County, Pei County, Suining, Shuyang, and Wujin, responding to this proposal. Millions of cadres and people in various counties launched a competition to win the soybean championship. Various counties continuously increased their measures and targets. A great revolution was carried out in farming and cultivation measures. Deep plowing was universally implemented, land preparation was standardized into raised fields, base fertilizer was generally applied, improved varieties were selected, the seeding rate was increased by about 50% compared to the past, appropriate close planting was carried out, more than 80% of the soybean fields were top-dressed once or twice, some areas were top-dressed three times, and weeding was done more than four or five times to ensure that there were no weeds in the fields. This year, soybean pests occurred widely, and various localities adopted a combination of manual capture and chemical control, and a combination of local and foreign pesticides, mobilizing the masses to carry out round-the-clock emergency prevention and control, which did not cause major insect damage, ensuring increased soybean production.

    江苏早大豆亩产384斤
    新华社南京9日电　江苏省的早大豆获得大面积丰收。全省间作的早大豆按42.5％折算，实际面积为九十八万三千五百亩，加上单作的早大豆面积一百五十七万六千七百亩，共有二百五十六万零二百亩，实收总产量九亿八千五百一十五万斤，平均单产三百八十四点一二斤。大豆的主要产区徐州专区，亩产五百八十六斤，比去年增产八倍以上。
    近几年来，江苏省大豆产量虽然有所增长，但每年亩产都在百斤上下，而且很不稳定，因此许多人把大豆看作是“低产作物”，认为很难增产。大跃进以来，广大干部、群众破除迷信，下定决心为大豆摘掉低产帽子。灌云县首先倡议实现大豆亩产五百斤县，接着就有邳县、沛县、睢宁、沭阳、武进等市县响应了这一倡议。各县千百万干部群众为夺取大豆冠军，展开了竞赛。各县措施指标不断加码。在耕作栽培措施上实行了大革命，普遍进行了深耕，整地畦田化，普遍施了基肥，选用了良种，播种量比过去增加50％左右，进行了适当密植，80％以上的大豆田追了一遍至二遍肥，部分地区追了三遍肥，除草在四、五遍以上，做到田中无杂草。今年大豆虫害曾普遍发生，各地采取了人工捕捉与药械防治相结合、土洋农药相结合的办法，发动群众日夜突击防治，没有造成重大虫害，确保了大豆增产。
