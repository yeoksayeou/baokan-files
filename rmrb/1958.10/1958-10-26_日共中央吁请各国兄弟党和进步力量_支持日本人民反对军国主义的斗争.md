Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party wrote to communist parties, workers' parties, democratic parties, and progressive individuals of all countries on the 24th, appealing for support for the Japanese people's struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of reviving militarism and revising the "Police Duties Execution Law."

The letter first reveals that the Kishi Nobusuke government's sudden submission of the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law" to the extraordinary session of the Diet is an attempt to strengthen the suppression of the labor and democratic movements, deprive the people of their rights and freedoms, revise the entire constitution including the articles prohibiting the use of force, restore the extreme nationalistic military police state, and establish a system capable of dispatching troops abroad to invade neighboring Asian countries.

The letter points out that the ongoing negotiations on revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" after the Dulles-Fujiyama talks are aimed at concluding a new military alliance between Japan and the the U.S., strengthening the Japan-U.S. joint combat system, and establishing a Northeast Asian military alliance. This is inextricably linked to the U.S.'s policy of dominating the world and means the revival of Japanese imperialism and militarism. Kishi Nobusuke's remarks to American reporters on October 14 thoroughly exposed this face of his.

The letter says that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks demonstrate his intention to follow and collude with U.S. imperialism and launch another aggression against neighboring Asian countries.

The letter says: Such a plan to revive Japanese militarism will make the current U.S. use of Japanese bases to infringe on Chinese territory and carry out armed provocations against the Chinese people even more dangerous, which threatens the security of the people of neighboring countries and threatens world peace.

The letter says that the people of all countries who have a glorious history of fighting against the brutal aggression of Japanese imperialism during the Second World War will never allow Class A war criminal Kishi Nobusuke, a member of the Tojo cabinet, and his followers to revive militarism wantonly.

The letter points out that the Japanese people have suffered greatly because they were unable to prevent Japanese imperialism's foreign aggression, but today the Japanese people have grown up and will never allow the Kishi Nobusuke government's sinister schemes to succeed.

The letter points out that the struggle of the Japanese people, centered on the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the trade unions, against the revision of the Police Law and against the revival of the military police state is rapidly rising and becoming an unprecedentedly large-scale movement.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party stated in the letter that it, together with millions of supporters, is standing at the forefront of this struggle, making every effort to win the victory.

The Japanese Communist Party appeals to the fraternal parties, democratic parties, and all progressive people of all countries to strengthen solidarity and take action to support the struggle of the Japanese people in order to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to threaten the peace of Asia and the world, obstruct the friendship and goodwill of the people of all countries, and lead the Japanese people into war.

    日共中央吁请各国兄弟党和进步力量
    支持日本人民反对军国主义的斗争
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央24日写信给世界各国的共产党、工人党和民主党派以及进步人士，吁请支持日本人民为反对岸信介政府复活军国主义的政策和修改“警察官职务执行法”而进行的斗争。
    信中首先揭露：岸信介政府突然向国会临时会议提出“警察官职务执行法修正案”，是企图加强镇压劳工运动和民主运动，剥夺人民的权利和自由，修改包括有禁止使用武力的条款的全部宪法，恢复极端的国粹主义的军事警察国家，以建立能够派遣军队到国外去侵略邻近的亚洲国家的体系。
    信中指出，在杜勒斯—藤山会谈结束以后，目前正在进行的关于修改日美“安全条约”的谈判，是以在日美两国间缔结新的军事同盟、加强日美共同作战体系和建立东北亚军事同盟为目的的。这是同美国的统治世界政策有分不开的密切关系，并且意味着复活日本帝国主义和军国主义。岸信介在10月14日向美国记者发表的谈话，彻底暴露了他的这种面目。
    信里说，岸信介的这番谈话表明了他的意图是在于追随和勾结美帝国主义，再次对邻近的亚洲各国发动侵略。
    信中说：像这样的复活日本军国主义的计划，将使得目前美国利用日本基地侵犯中国领土和对中国人民进行武装挑衅的行为更加凶险，这威胁着邻近各国人民的安全和威胁着世界和平。
    信中说，在第二次世界大战时期，具有同日本帝国主义的残暴侵略进行斗争的光荣历史的各国人民，绝不会容许曾经身为东条内阁的一员的甲级战犯岸信介以及他的党徒恣意复活军国主义。
    信中指出，日本人民曾经因为没有能够阻止日本帝国主义的对外侵略而备尝痛苦，但是，日本人民今天已经成长起来，决不再让岸信介政府的恶毒阴谋得逞。
    信中指出，以共产党、社会党和工会为中心的日本人民的反对修改警察法、反对复活军事警察国家的斗争，正在迅速高涨，成为空前大规模的运动。
    日本共产党中央在信里表示，它同几百万的支持者正在站在这个斗争的前列，全力争取斗争的胜利。
    日本共产党吁请各国兄弟党、民主党派和一切进步人民，为了粉碎岸信介政府威胁亚洲和世界和平、阻挠各国人民友好和亲善、把日本人民导进战争的阴谋，而加紧团结起来，并且采取行动，以支持日本人民的斗争。
