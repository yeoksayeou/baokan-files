    Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, Says
    The United States is the Most Hated Country
    (Report from this newspaper) According to a United Press International dispatch: Former United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George F. Kennan, said on the 12th, while addressing a gathering of 1,500 foreign students at Brandeis University, that the United States is the most hated country in the world.
    He said, "Apart from this (American) situation, I cannot think of any other instance where a major power has attracted so much vilification, so much ill-feeling, so much dissatisfaction, and so much criticism, and, in some cases, so much naked hatred to itself; or at least become the object of all this."
    Kennan admitted that "in Asia, we are accused of having unworthy motives for our economic activities, attempting to use our economic power to control other countries, and being unsympathetic to the broad national sentiments that dominate so many people."
    Kennan also said, "In Europe, we are resented for very complex reasons." But he said: "I suspect it is largely because people envy what are considered to be our riches."

    前美国驻苏大使凯南说
    美国是最受人憎恨的国家
    本报讯　据合众国际社消息：据前美国驻苏联大使乔治·弗·凯南12日在一个有一千五百人出席的布兰德斯大学外国学生集会上发表演说时说，美国是世界上最受人憎恨的国家。
    他说，“除了这一个（美国的）情况外，我想不出其他的事例，说明哪一个大国竟为自己招来这么多的詈骂，这么多的恶感，这么多的不满和这么多的批评，以及在某些情况下这么多的赤裸裸的仇恨；或至少成为这一切的对象。
    凯南承认“在亚洲，人们指责我们进行经济活动的动机是不值得尊敬的，企图用我们的经济实力来控制其他国家，并且指责我们对支配着这么多人的广泛的民族情绪缺乏同情。”
    凯南又说，“在欧洲，由于非常复杂的理由，我们受人怨恨”。但是他却说：“我怀疑，在很大程度上是因为人们羡慕那些被认为是我们的财富的东西。”
