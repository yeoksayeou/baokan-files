    Conditions Arise From Enthusiasm
    Jiu Ze
    "Conditions arise from enthusiasm" – a phrase that incisively reveals the role of human subjective initiative and creativity. The large-scale development of the electric power industry in Jilin, Jiangxi, and other places under extremely difficult conditions by adopting small-scale, indigenous, and mass-movement methods is a clear example of this subjective initiative at work.
    However, all sorts of conditionalism can still be encountered everywhere. Existing conditions determine everything – this is a relatively prevalent form of conditionalism. The tune of this conditionalism is: "You can only eat noodles if you have money," "Do only what you have enough people to do." For example, if a power station requires two hundred tons of steel axles according to the design, then there must be two hundred tons of ready-made steel axles; otherwise, the power station cannot be built. If you criticize them for lacking enthusiasm at this time, they will be very annoyed and say, "We can't just indulge in fantasy; enthusiasm must be based on conditions!"
    It is not difficult to see that, first, these conditionalists exclude an important factor that constitutes a condition – people, people with a high degree of socialist political consciousness – when calculating. On their bills, there is only how much steel axle, how much cement, but they do not see the wisdom, enthusiasm, and creativity of people, and how much steel axle and cement this wisdom, enthusiasm, and creativity can create, and how many ways to overcome difficulties can be thought of. Of course, they do not include it in the account. Second, these conditionalists completely separate enthusiasm and conditions, failing to see the relationship between the two; moreover, when they think something is impossible, but others are determined to do it, they describe this enthusiasm as fantasy and reckless action.
    "Enthusiasm must be based on conditions," this is generally true. But what is enthusiasm? Enthusiasm is politics, it is a revolutionary will, a revolutionary thought, a revolutionary strong desire. It is produced in the situation of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction. That is to say, it is an objective reflection, an objective requirement; once this enthusiasm is produced, it will create conditions and accelerate the construction of our socialist cause. The facts of Jiangxi, Jilin, and other provinces accelerating the development of the electric power industry specifically illustrate this problem. The conditions for developing the electric power industry in many places were originally very poor, but when the development of steel and machinery urgently needed electricity to catch up, due to the full play of subjective initiative, methods were found, conditions were gradually created, and difficulties were gradually overcome. Measures such as starting construction on all fronts, ensuring key projects, completing them in batches, using small-scale projects to serve large-scale projects, and using slow progress to relieve urgent needs were also created.
    Conditions arise from enthusiasm, correctly reflecting that the revolutionary enthusiasm in the situation of the Great Leap Forward in our country's socialist construction can proactively promote the development of our country's socialist cause. Let us accelerate the socialist construction of our country under the guidance of this thought!

    干劲出条件
    久泽
    “干劲出条件”，一语道破了人的主观能动性和创造性的作用。吉林、江西等地在极困难的条件下采取小、土、群的办法，大办电力工业，就是这种主观能动作用的一个鲜明例证。
    但是，形形色色的条件论还到处可以碰到。现有条件决定一切，这是现在较为普遍的一种条件论。这种条件论的论调是：“尽钱吃面”“有多少人办多少人的事”；比如说，一个电站按照设计需要二百吨钢轴，那就得要有现成的二百吨钢轴，不然电站就不能建设。这时要是批评他干劲不足，那他会很恼火，说：“我们总不能想入非非，干劲也得以条件为基础呀！”
    不难看出，第一，这种条件论者在算账的时候把构成一种条件的一个重要因素——人，有着高度社会主义政治觉悟的人这个因素剔除在外。在他们的账单上只有钢轴多少，水泥多少，至于人的智慧、干劲、创造性和这种智慧、干劲、创造性能够创造出多少钢轴、水泥，能够想出多少克服困难的办法，他们看不到。当然也就不把它计入账内。第二，这种条件论者把干劲和条件完全分割了开来，看不到两者之间的关系；并且，当他们认为办不到的事情，别人坚决干，他们就把这种干劲说成是空想和蛮干。
    “干劲也得以条件为基础”，这一般地说不错。但干劲是什么？干劲就是政治，就是一种革命意志，一种革命思想，一种革命的强烈愿望。它是在我国社会主义建设大跃进的形势下产生的。就是说，是一种客观反映，一种客观要求；这种干劲一经产生出来，它就会创造出条件，加速我国社会主义事业的建设。江西、吉林等省加速发展电力工业的事实具体地说明了这个问题。许多地方发展电力工业的条件本来都是很差的，但是当钢铁、机械的发展迫切需要电力赶上去的时候，由于充分发挥主观能动作用，办法便想出来了，条件逐步创造出来了，困难逐步克服了。全面开工，保证重点，分批建成，以小服大，以缓济急等措施，也创造出来了。
    干劲出条件，正确反映了我国社会主义建设大跃进形势的革命干劲能够能动地推进我国社会主义事业的发展。让我们在这一思想的指导下加速我国的社会主义建设！
