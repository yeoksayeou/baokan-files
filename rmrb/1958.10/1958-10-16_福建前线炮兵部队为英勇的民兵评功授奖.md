Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 13th – The artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front have recently been actively commending and awarding the heroic militiamen who have valiantly cooperated with them in combat.

In the battles to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen, the militiamen in the coastal areas of Fujian became a powerful assistant to the frontline artillery. Many of them lived in the artillery squads from late August, helping the artillery build fortifications, transport ammunition, and pass shells. Many even directly served as gunners in combat. In a document to a township Party committee, one artillery battalion suggested that three militiamen be commended. Among them, Huang Jianzhi, who is under twenty years old, served as the third gunner in a artillery battle, loading thirty shells in one go. Huang Jingwei braved artillery fire during a fierce artillery battle to run to the artillery squad and help the gunners wipe shells, and clean up shell casings and empty ammunition boxes. Many militiamen on Dadeng Island not only became excellent gunners, but some also rushed to connect wires under intense artillery fire. Zhang Mingduan, Zhang Jiming, and others connected more than twenty telephone lines that were cut off by enemy shells in one artillery barrage.

Currently, the artillery units are compiling the deeds of outstanding militiamen and recommending that the leading organs or the townships and communes to which the militiamen belong grant them commendations. Some have even directly commended or awarded them.

    福建前线炮兵部队为英勇的民兵评功授奖
    新华社福建前线13日电　中国人民解放军福建前线各炮兵部队，最近纷纷为英勇配合他们作战的沿海民兵评功、授奖。
    在严惩金门蒋军的战斗中，福建沿海地区的民兵，成为前线炮兵的有力助手。他们中的许多人从8月下旬就住在炮兵班里，帮助炮兵修工事、搬运弹药、传递炮弹，有许多人还在战斗中直接担任了炮手。炮兵某营给某乡党委会写的一份材料中，建议给三个民兵记功。其中不满二十岁的黄坚志，在一次炮战中，当了三炮手，一气装填了三十多发炮弹。黄经伟在一次激烈的炮战中，冒着炮火跑到炮兵班，帮助炮手们擦炮弹、清理炮弹壳和空弹药箱。大嶝岛上的许多民兵，不仅成了出色的炮手，有些人还在炽烈的炮火下抢接电线，张明段、张基明等，在一次炮火中接了二十多处被敌人炮弹打断了的电话线。
    目前，各炮兵部队都把优秀民兵的事迹整理出来，建议领导机关或民兵本人所在的乡、社给予记功，有的还直接为他们评了功或授了奖。
