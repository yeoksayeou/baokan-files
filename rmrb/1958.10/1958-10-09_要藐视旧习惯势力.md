    It Is Necessary to Despise Old Habits and Forces
    Chen Xu
    The current people's commune movement is reaching a climax. This is a leap towards communism, leaving capitalism, individual economy, and private ownership far, far behind. Some people once worried whether the masses would easily accept such a leap, and whether it would take a long time. However, the vigorous progress of the mass movement has greatly surpassed the cooperativization of 1955, overwhelming and unstoppable. In just about a month, the entire province of Gansu has become communalized.
    This incident once again reminds us that we must adequately estimate the consciousness of the masses. The masses demand socialism and communism. The masses have already risen to break the spiritual shackles left over from the old society, fight against old ideas, and break with traditional habits.
    In the face of this situation, everyone is encouraged, and everyone is also undergoing a test. Those who stand in front of the mass movement, have the courage to despise all old habits and forces, and lead the masses to build a new life without any scruples, are qualified to be promoters. Those who stand beside or behind the mass movement, overestimate the forces of habit and underestimate the consciousness of the masses, are destined to play the role of retarders.
    Some people who prefer "prudence" often seize Lenin's words, "The force of habit of millions is the most terrible force," as a shield. However, conservative thinking can never find sufficient reason, and it is only self-defeating to cite classical works away from specific situations. Lenin's words appeared in Chapter 5 of "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder," written in 1920. At that time, it was to teach the West European communists to understand well the interrelationship between leaders, parties, classes, and the masses, and to fully estimate the difficulties of transforming small producers, so as to adopt correct policies and tactics to overcome these difficulties. Of course, this teaching has universal significance. Our Party, leading 500 million peasants, gradually implemented cooperativization, and further realized the people's communes. The flexibility of tactics and the richness of steps and methods should be said to be a model of deeply understanding and implementing Lenin's above-mentioned teachings. However, today's situation is that ownership has been changed for several years, the individual economy no longer exists, and the forces of habit left over from the old society mainly exist in the ideological aspects of the masses. The foundation has been updated, and the old superstructure is bound to change. As long as it is correctly guided, it is just like "building a high dam and pouring down," which is not difficult. Furthermore, Lenin's book "Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder" very prominently criticizes the phenomenon in the communist movement of only shouting slogans and not seriously doing mass work. The spirit of the passage on estimating the forces of habit of the masses is also here. Obviously, our situation is completely different. Our Party has always adhered to the mass line, and in various revolutionary stages, in realizing various major tasks, it has always insisted on mobilizing the masses, carrying out revolutionary struggles, and achieving tangible victories. As for the influence left by the old society to the masses, including thoughts, viewpoints, styles, habits, etc., all those that are not suitable for the socialist economic base and do not meet the needs of the people, even if they have hundreds or thousands of years of tradition, must be changed in a very short time. This must be done, and it can be done, and it should be said that there is no doubt about it.
    Of course, to speak of despising old habits and forces is by no means to say that there is no need for flexible policies and arduous mass work. To speak of despising is not to advocate sleeping more and thinking less, but to advocate fighting more bravely. Flexible policies and arduous mass work are needed at all times.
    Old habits and forces are the remnants of the old life, formed by the old production methods and lifestyles being repeated countless times among the masses. Today, we want to build a new socialist and communist life, to establish new thoughts, viewpoints, styles, and habits among the masses to replace the old ones. The fundamental method is to follow the mass line and make tenacious struggles. Some things may succeed in one reform; some things may require multiple reforms to finally succeed. Together with the masses, firmly support new things, eliminate old influences, and persevere until socialism and communism are embodied in the actual lives of hundreds of millions of people. This is our style, our aspiration, and our responsibility!

### 要藐视旧习惯势力

    要藐视旧习惯势力
    陈煦
    目前人民公社运动正在高潮。这是向共产主义的一个跃进，把资本主义、个体经济、私有制抛得很远很远了。曾经有些人担心，这样一个跳跃，群众是否容易接受？是否要花很长的时间？然而，群众运动进展的猛烈大大超过1955年的合作化，排山倒海，势不可当，不过一个月光景，甘肃全省就公社化了。
    这件事，再次提醒我们，要足够估量群众的觉悟。群众要求社会主义，要求共产主义。群众已经起来自己打碎旧社会遗留下的精神上的枷锁，同旧观念搏斗，同传统的习惯势力决裂。
    在这个形势面前，人人受到鼓舞，人人也经受着考验。站在群众运动前面的人，有勇气藐视一切旧的习惯势力，毫无顾虑地领导群众建设新的生活，就有资格当促进派。站在群众运动旁边或后边的人，对习惯势力估计过高，对群众的觉悟估计过低，就注定要充当促退派的角色。
    有些偏爱“稳健”的人，还常常抓住列宁的一句话“千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力”作为挡箭牌。但是，保守思想永远找不到充足的理由，离开具体情况去引证经典著作，也只有自己倒霉。列宁的这句话，出在“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书第五章，写于1920年。当时是教导西欧共产党人，要很好地理解领袖、政党、阶级、群众间的相互关系，要充分地估计改造小生产者的困难，以便采取正确的政策、策略，战胜这种困难。当然，这种教导具有普遍的意义。我们党，领导五亿农民，逐步实行合作化，更进而实现人民公社化，策略的灵活，步骤、方法的丰富多彩，应当说是深刻理解和实行列宁上述教导的典范。但是，今天情况是所有制已改变几年了，个体经济不存在了，旧社会遗留下来的习惯势力，主要是存在于群众的意识形态方面。基础已经更新，旧的上层建筑势在必变，只要加以正确引导，就恰似“高屋建瓴，倾泄而下”，这不是很难的事了。再则，列宁的“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”一书，非常突出地批判共产主义运动中只喊口号、不认真做群众工作的现象，关于估量群众习惯势力的一段话，精神也在这里。很明显，我们的情况是完全不同的。我们党一贯坚持群众路线，在各个革命阶段，在实现各项重大任务时，都是坚持发动群众，开展革命斗争，取得实实在在的胜利。至于旧社会遗留给群众的影响，包括思想、观点、作风、习惯等，凡是不适合于社会主义经济基础的，不符合人民的需要的，那怕有几百年、几千年的传统，都要在很短的时间内加以改变。这一点必须做到，也能够做到，应该说是毫无疑问的了。
    当然，讲藐视旧习惯势力，绝不是说就不需要灵活的政策和艰苦的群众工作了。讲藐视，不是提倡多睡觉，少想办法，而是提倡更勇敢地去斗争。灵活的政策和艰苦的群众工作，任何时候都是需要的。
    旧习惯势力是旧生活的遗迹，是旧的生产方法、生活样式在群众中重复了无数次所形成的。今天我们要建设社会主义、共产主义的新生活，要在群众中树立新的思想、观点、作风、习惯，去代替旧的东西，根本的办法是走群众路线和作韧性的斗争。有些事，可能一次改革就成功；有些事，或许要作多次的改革，才能最后成功。同群众一起，坚定地扶持新事物，扫除旧影响，坚持不懈，直到社会主义、共产主义体现在亿万人民的实际生活中。这就是我们的作风，我们的志愿，我们的责任！
