    Four Cotton-Padded Coats
    Feng Wenlian
    In order to support the iron and steel marshal's grand entrance, the Qilizhuang Production Team sent out eleven carts with people and horses for transportation, which would take almost a week. That afternoon, Liu Guangzu returned home, and after a while, he went, covered in sweat, to the homes of bachelors like Zeng Defu. Finally, he rushed, breathless, to the home of the production team leader, Shi Changhua, and said to the leader in a flustered manner, "Leader, something bad has happened! Our cotton-padded coats have been stolen!"
    This sudden theft puzzled the leader greatly. He thought: So many years after liberation, nothing has been lost in the village. Now that we've formed a people's commune, are we going to have such cases?
    "Leader, quickly think of a solution! We're still wearing them to drive the night shift tonight!"
    The leader was about to ring the bell to summon the commune members for an emergency meeting to discuss the matter when Wang Ershen, a seventy-five-year-old from the nearby Happiness Home, heard their conversation. She walked over, squinting, and said slowly:
    "Oh dear, losing a cotton-padded coat is a small matter. It would be terrible if you two were to argue and cause trouble!" She then pursed her lips and smiled.
    Seeing her expression, the leader was even more puzzled. He thought: This matter of the lost cotton-padded coats probably has something to do with her.
    After a while, Li Si Grandma and Niu Da Ma from the Happiness Home came in, each carrying two cotton-padded coats:
    "Uncle, we've caught the thief! Here you go—" They then threw the cotton-padded coats to the leader.
    Old Liu grabbed the cotton-padded coats and examined them carefully. Every one of them was washed and cleaned as if they were new. He patted the coats and said, "Ah! So you were the ones who took them apart and washed them! Wait, we'll thank you when we come back after completing our task!" He then grabbed the clean cotton-padded coats and hopped and skipped away to drive the night shift.

    四件棉袄
    冯文连
    为了支援钢铁元帅升帐，七里庄生产队十一辆大车连人带马出去搞运输，快个把礼拜了。那天下午，刘光祖回到家，一会儿，他又满头大汗地往曾德富等单身汉家里转了一圈。最后，上气不接下气地直奔生产队长石昌华家，见到队长便气急慌忙地说：“队长，不好了！我们的棉袄被人偷走了！”
    这种突如其来的窃案，弄得队长十分纳闷。心想：解放以后这么多年，庄里还没有丢过东西，如今成立了人民公社倒会犯这号案子？
    “队长，快想办法呀！今晚还穿着赶夜车哩”！
    队长正准备去敲钟召集社员开紧急会，讨论这件事，谁知他俩的说话，被隔壁幸福院里七十五岁的王二婶听到了。她忙走过来。眯?着两眼，慢条斯理地说：
    “唉呀，丢了棉袄是小事，天给你俩吵塌就麻烦啦！”说完就抿着嘴笑。
    看到她的表情，队长心里更纳闷。心想：这丢棉袄的事，八成和她有关系。
    过了一阵子，幸福院的李四奶奶和牛大妈，每人抱了两件棉袄也进来了：
    “他大叔，贼给我们逮住了！喏——”说完，把棉袄扔给了队长。
    老刘抢过棉袄，仔细一看，件件拆洗得像新的，他拍着棉袄，说：“啊！原来是您们给拆洗了！等着吧，我们完成任务回来谢您们！”说完，抱着拆洗得干干净净的棉袄连蹦带跳地赶夜车去了。
