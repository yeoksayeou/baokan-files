    Looking for the Secretary
    Yu Kailai
    The day before yesterday I went to find the secretary,
    The secretary was looking at blueprints,
    The paper was a drawing of an indigenous blast furnace,
    In his hand was a meter ruler.
    Yesterday I went to find the secretary again,
    The secretary was in command at the construction site,
    The chopping knife rang with a "ding-dong",
    His whole body and face were covered in mud.
    Today I went to find the secretary again,
    The secretary was at the furnace checking the wind force,
    With a whoosh the furnace door opened,
    Ten thousand people cheered to welcome the molten iron.
    The secretary took command and planted the red flag,
    Thousands of heroes gathered,
    Like a giant dragon riding the east wind,
    Ten thousand blast furnaces rise from the ground.

    找书记
    余开来
    前天我去找书记，
    书记正在看图纸，
    纸上画的土高炉，
    手中拿的米突尺。
    昨天又去找书记，
    书记挂帅在工地，
    砍刀碰得叮咚响，
    满身满脸都是泥。
    今天再去找书记，
    书记炉前看风力，
    哗啦一下炉门开，
    万众欢呼迎铁水。
    书记挂帅插红旗，
    千万英雄来结集，
    好比巨龙乘东风，
    万座高炉平地起。
