Xinhua News Agency, October 11th dispatch: Karachi, October 10th dispatch: Pakistani President Mirza and Military Administrator of Martial Law, Army Commander Ayub Khan, stated that they will jointly formulate policies, which will then be implemented by the army.

The two men received reporters on the 9th and 10th. They both emphasized that Pakistan will continue to honor the international obligations undertaken by the previous government.

Mirza, when discussing the actions of abolishing the constitution and issuing martial law, said: "My power does not come from the constitution, nor is it explicitly stipulated in law." He said: "I chose the path of peaceful revolution to save the country from a bloody revolution."

Ayub Khan said, "What I want to avoid is anything similar to what happened in Iraq."

Mirza and Ayub Khan both said that Pakistan is "not abandoning democracy forever," but they added that they do not know exactly when martial law will be lifted.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, October 11th dispatch: Karachi dispatch: Pakistani President Mirza issued an order on the 10th stipulating that the "Islamic Republic of Pakistan" will henceforth be referred to only as "Pakistan."

The order also stated that all laws and regulations that were in effect under the old constitution, which was abolished on October 7th, will continue to be valid.

All existing courts will continue to exist, and they are all bound by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to issue summonses, but they may not issue summonses to the Chief Martial Law Administrator or Deputy Administrators, or to anyone exercising power or judicial authority on their orders.

Regarding the new regime, Chief Martial Law Administrator Ayub Khan, at a press conference held here yesterday, called it the "President-Military Regime."

    据新华社11日讯　据卡拉奇10日消息：巴基斯坦总统米尔扎和军事戒严令执行人、陆军司令阿尤布汗说，他们两人将一起制订政策，然后由陆军来执行。
    他们两人在9日和10日接见了新闻记者。他们都强调说，巴基斯坦将继续承担前届政府所承担的国际义务。
    米尔扎在谈到采取废除宪法和发布戒严令的行动时说：“我的权力不是来自宪法，也不是在法律上有明文规定的。”他说：“我选择和平革命的方式以使国家避免一次流血的革命”。
    阿尤布汗说，“我希望避免的事情就是任何类似在伊拉克所发生的事情。”
    米尔扎和阿尤布汗都说，巴基斯坦“不是永远摒弃民主”，但是，他们补充说，他们不确切地知道什么时候将解除戒严。
    据新华社卡拉奇11日电　卡拉奇消息：巴基斯坦总统米尔扎在10日颁布了一项命令，规定“巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国”从今后仅称为“巴基斯坦”。
    命令还说，根据10月7日被废除的旧宪法有效的一切法律和条例将继续有效。
    现有的一切法院将继续存在，它们都受到最高法院的约束。最高法院和高等法院有权发出传票，但是它们不得对戒严令执行长官或副长官或奉他们的命令运用权力或司法权的任何人发出传票。
    关于新政权，戒严令执行长官阿尤布汗昨天在这里举行的记者招待会上把它称作“总统——军事政权”。
