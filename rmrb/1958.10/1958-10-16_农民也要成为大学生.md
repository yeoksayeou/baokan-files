Peasants Must Also Become University Students
Wang Changjiang, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Xiaohetai Township, Changchun Suburban District

    Under the new situation of the great development of socialist construction and the great leap forward in production, technical and cultural revolutions have become the urgent demands of the broad masses of peasants in Hongqi People's Commune, Xiaohetai Township. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line, the Township Party Committee has liberated its thinking, brought into play the spirit of communist daring to think, dare to act, and dare to innovate, and founded a new type of Hongqi People's Commune Hongqi University. This university is divided into three levels: advanced (part-work, part-study), intermediate (mainly using spare time for regular classes), and elementary (those who cannot enter the advanced or intermediate levels enter the elementary level). The whole school will have sixteen departments, including vegetable, forestry and fruit, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, literature and entertainment, and military sports. Fifteen departments have already started classes, with a total of sixty-one classes and two thousand three hundred and eighty-five commune members enrolled. This ensures that students can study from the elementary level all the way to the advanced level. By adopting these educational forms, the township is confident that it can realize the universalization of higher education among peasants within fifteen years.

    We believe that in our populous country with a relatively backward culture, it is very difficult to raise the entire people to the level of higher education in a relatively short period without adopting the mass line method. Therefore, only by running schools by the whole people, with everyone being a student, and adopting methods such as "those who are capable can be teachers," can we achieve this great goal.

    农民也要成为大学生
    中共长春市郊区小河台乡党委副书记　王昌江
    小河台乡红旗人民公社，在社会主义建设事业大发展、生产大跃进的新形势下，技术革命和文化革命已成为广大农民的迫切要求，乡党委在总路线的光辉照耀下，解放思想，发挥了敢想敢干敢独创的共产主义精神，创办了一所新型的红旗人民公社红旗大学。这所大学共分高级（半工半读）、中级（基本上利用业余时间定期上课）、初级三级（不能入高、中级者均入初级），全校将有蔬菜、林果、畜牧、兽医、文娱、军体等十六个系，其中已有十五个系开学上课，共六十一个班，二千三百八十五名社员入学学习。这样就保证了学员们从初级一直学到高级。采取这几种教育形式，全乡在十五年以内，就可以有把握地在农民中实现普及高等教育。
    我们认为，在我们人口众多文化又比较落后的大国里，不采取群众路线的方法，在比较短的年度里把全民提高到高等教育的水平是很困难的。因此，只有全民办学，人人是学生，采取能者为师等办法，才能实现这个伟大的目的。
