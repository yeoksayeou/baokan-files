The world's first automated iron smelting furnace is under construction at the "Azovstal" factory in Zhdanov, Ukraine, Soviet Union.

This Soviet Union's largest iron smelting furnace is equipped with a system of automatic and computing equipment. This equipment will complete all complex and heavy operations: from weighing ore and charging the furnace to sending signals when smelting is complete. The instruments will continuously measure one hundred and fifty numerical values. Based on these values, the computing equipment will instantaneously (six pulses per second) complete the mathematical calculations of all technological indices of the blast furnace operation within one minute, and then transmit them to the control instruments to control the smelting process. The foreman's role is only to adjust the instruments and monitor them.

The automation system for the iron smelting furnace was designed by Ukrainian scientists in cooperation with engineers and designers from several factories in the Soviet Union. Some instruments for the automated blast furnace have already been manufactured and have undergone industrial testing.

    天下第一座自动化炼铁炉在建造中
    炼铁的一切复杂操作都将用自动设备完成
    苏联的乌克兰日丹诺夫城“阿佐弗斯塔尔”工厂正在建造世界第一座自动化炼铁炉。
    这座苏联最大的炼铁炉是用自动设备和计算设备系统装配的。这些设备将完成一切复杂而繁重的操作：从秤量矿石和装炉到发出炼好的信号。仪器将不停地进行一百五十项数值的测量，按照这些数值，计算设备闪电般地（每秒脉冲六次）在一分钟内做完炼铁炉操作全部工艺指数的数学计算，然后通过控制仪器传送给控制熔炼过程的机械。工长的作用只是调整仪器和看管仪器。
    炼铁炉的自动化系统是乌克兰的科学家同苏联一些工厂的工程师和设计者们合作设计的。自动化高炉的一部分仪器已经制成并且已经进行了工业试验。
