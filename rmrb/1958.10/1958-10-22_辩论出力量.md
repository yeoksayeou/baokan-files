Debate Creates Strength

(Our report) The fact that the autumn plowing and sowing speed of the Sanba People's Commune in Su County, Anhui Province, has increased tenfold proves that as long as the masses are mobilized and potential is tapped, the same number of people can do more.

This large commune, with more than 27,000 households, is currently facing four major tasks: a great battle for steel, the excavation of river network projects, the rush harvesting of rice, and autumn plowing and sowing. Labor is extremely tight. After unified allocation, less than 11,000 people were left to participate in autumn plowing and sowing. The task was very arduous. Early on, it was discovered that some production teams were only concerned with speed and disregarded quality, or that they were concerned with quality but the progress was very slow.

Seeing that the situation was not right, the Commune Party Committee immediately convened a branch secretary meeting on October 4th to ascertain the situation. They learned that there were two reasons for the slow progress and low quality of autumn plowing: first, some cadres and masses still had resistance to deep plowing, close planting, and ridge cultivation, and their enthusiasm was insufficient; second, the labor organization was not scientific, the potential had not been exploited, and cadres and masses had a fear of the difficulty of this year's autumn plowing and sowing tasks.

Therefore, the Party Committee decided to launch a debate among all commune members. After the debate, the situation completely changed, and the commune members tapped labor potential from various aspects. According to the needs of farm work and each person's special skills, they formed a deep plowing professional team of 6,300 people, camping in the fields, eating and living on the spot, saving the time of going back and forth to the fields, and being able to work at least two hours more per day. A fall planting professional team of 4,400 people brought fertilizer to the fields every time they went to work, which also accelerated the speed of fertilizer transportation. They also combined frost prevention by smoking indigenous fertilizer in the fields, reducing the amount of fertilizer transportation. While comprehensively promoting rope-drawn machines for deep plowing, they also adopted the method of using multiple plows to avoid delaying the autumn plowing time. In order to make strip planting and close planting fast and good, the method of using multiple seeders was universally promoted, so that each mu of land was planted with about 50 jin of wheat seeds. Public canteens delivered meals and tea to the fields.

After the commune adopted the above measures, labor efficiency increased rapidly, and the daily autumn plowing and sowing speed rose from more than 1,000 mu to 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 mu. By October 9th, more than 12,400 mu were completed in one day, ten times faster than the daily progress before the debate. The commune has completed the sowing of 57,000 mu of wheat, accounting for more than one-quarter of the plan. According to this speed, the commune's autumn plowing and sowing tasks can be completed ahead of schedule. (Shi Zhengzhang)

    辩论出力量
    本报讯从安徽省宿县三八人民公社秋耕秋种速度陡增十倍的事实证明，只要发动群众，挖掘潜力，一样多的人，可以做更多的事。
    这个拥有二万七千多户的大社，当前正面临着大战钢铁、开挖河网化工程、抢收水稻和秋耕秋种四大主要任务，劳力空前紧张。经过统一调配，留给参加秋耕秋种的还不到一万一千人。任务是很艰巨的，一开始就发现有部分生产队只图快，不顾质量，或者是顾了质量，但进度很慢等现象。
    公社党委看情况不对头，立即就在10月4日召开了支部书记会议，摸清了情况，知道秋耕进度不快、质量不高的原因有二：首先是在干部和群众中，对深耕、密植和做畦田等还存在着抵触思想，干劲不足；二来是劳动组织还不科学，潜力没有发挥，干部和群众对今年的秋耕秋种任务有畏难情绪。
    于是党委会就决定在全体社员中开展了一次辩论。经过辩论，局面就完全改变了，社员们从多方面来挖掘劳动潜力。他们根据农活需要、每人的特长，编成了六千三百人的深耕专业队，在田间安营扎寨，就地食宿，节省了往返田间的时间，每天至少可多干两小时的活；有四千四百人参加的秋种专业队，利用每次上工的机会，把肥料带下田，也加快了运肥的速度。他们还结合防霜，在田间熏制土肥，减少了肥料的运输量。在全面推广绳索牵引机来深耕的同时，一边采用套犁的办法深耕，以免延误秋耕时间。为了使条播密植搞得又快又好，普遍推广了套耩的办法，使每亩田都下了五十斤左右的麦种。公共食堂把饭食茶水送到田头。
    这个社采取了上述措施以后，劳动效率迅速提高，每天的秋耕秋种速度由一千多亩，逐日上升为二千、四千、八千亩，到10月9日，一天完成了一万二千四百多亩，比辩论会前的每日进度快了十倍。全社已完成五万七千亩的小麦播种，占计划的四分之一以上。根据这样的速度，全社的秋耕秋种任务可以提前完成。　（石正章）
