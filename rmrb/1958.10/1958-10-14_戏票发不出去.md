    Tickets That Couldn't Be Given Away

    One Saturday afternoon, the union chairman handed me four theater tickets, patted me on the shoulder and said, "There are too few tickets for too many people, explain it well to everyone!"

    Holding the tickets, I was really worried. Who should I give these four tickets to? Those who don't get them will surely have opinions about me again, just like last time.

    I entered the office and said in a voice full of good news, "Comrades, good news! Guess what!" Everyone immediately looked at me with surprise.

    "The second batch of steel rails has been produced, right?" the "theater fan" Xiao Wang asked first.

    "That's already old news."

    "I know!" Little Ma, who loves to play, said with confidence, "The No. 5 blast furnace has been built! Right?"

    "You didn't guess right either."

    "Then tell us quickly!" Everyone urged me.

    "Everyone listen!" I coughed and said slowly, "There's a performance tonight, and our group got four tickets--" Before I could finish, everyone "ummed" from their noses, like deflated balloons, and slumped down.

    "Yo! What's going on?" I was surprised: Could it be that everyone still remembers the last time we distributed tickets? So I said, "I suggest that those who didn't get a ticket last time should have priority this time..."

    "I give up!" the "theater fan" said sincerely. "I have to participate in building the No. 5 blast furnace tonight!"

    "I give up too!" Little Ma said with a smile, "I signed up early to join them in working hard all night!"

    Then, one after another, they all said in unison that they gave up.

    I had no choice but to return the four tickets to the union chairman.

### 戏票发不出去

    戏票发不出去
    星期六的下午，工会主席交给我四张戏票，拍着我的肩胛说：“票少人多，分不过来，好好给大家解释解释！”
    我拿着戏票真愁得慌，这四张戏票给谁呀？分不到的人一定又像上回那样对我有意见。
    进了办公室，我用报喜的声音说：“同志们，好消息！猜猜看！”大伙立时都惊喜地望着我。
    “第二批钢轨制成了是不是？”“戏迷”小王抢先说道。
    “那已经是旧闻了。”
    “我知道！”最爱玩儿的小马满有把握地说：“第五号高炉砌成了！对吧？”
    “也没猜中。”
    “那你快说吧！”大伙都催我。
    “大家听着！”我咳嗽了一声，慢吞吞地说：“今晚有演出，咱们小组分到四张票——”我的话还没有说完，大伙从鼻子里“嗯”了一声，像泄了气的皮球，一个个瘪下去了。
    “哟！怎么回事啊？”我感到诧异：莫非大伙还记着上回分票的事儿？我就说：“我建议，上回没分到的，这回有优先权。……”
    “我放弃！”“戏迷”真诚地说。“今晚我要参加建造五号高炉呢！”
    “我也放弃！”小马笑嘻嘻地说：“我早报上名，参加他们苦战一夜哩！”
    接着，一个个都异口同声地说放弃。
    我只好把那四张戏票仍旧还给工会主席。
