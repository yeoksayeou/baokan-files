    "On Contradiction" Solved My Ideological Contradictions
    Soldier of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Cheng Yin Suo
    I am a private in the People's Liberation Army. I only attended school for four years before joining the army, and now my education level is that of an elementary school graduate.
    In the spring of 1957, right-wing elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party. I felt extremely resentful, but I didn't know where the fallacies of the right-wing elements were wrong, and I couldn't refute them effectively. Sometimes I couldn't even distinguish between right and wrong, and I couldn't draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. Through this struggle, I deeply felt that it is very dangerous for a revolutionary soldier, a Communist Party member, not to seriously study political theory and improve his understanding. From then on, I made up my mind to study theory, study philosophy, and study Chairman Mao's works.
    In the past two years, I have read more than 30 theoretical books, including "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members," and I have written 150,000 words of study notes. Although my study is not deep or thorough, my ideological understanding and theoretical level have improved somewhat. Here, I will only talk about my experience in solving the struggle between new and old ideas in light of "On Contradiction."
    There was a soldier who joined the army and the Party at the same time as me, and his cultural level was even lower than mine, but he became a sergeant squad leader, and I am still a private. At that time, I thought, he is really great, but I can't do it. After studying theory, I realized that this kind of thinking is bourgeois individualism. Different positions are just different divisions of labor in the revolutionary cause, and there is no distinction between high and low. Being a squad leader is important, and helping the leader do some things is also important. When I realized my mistake, I became even more enthusiastic about being a private. Now I feel very honored to be called an ordinary soldier. Through this ideological struggle, I realized that if communist ideology defeats individualist ideology, and the ideological contradiction is resolved, then we will move forward; if individualist ideology defeats communist ideology, then it will be terrible, and we will make mistakes.
    So, when a person has a contradiction between new and old ideas, how can he ensure that the new ideas defeat the old ideas? My experience is that on the one hand, we must rely on the leadership of the Party and the mutual supervision of comrades, and on the other hand, we must rely on individual consciousness. We should always pay attention to the fact that in the struggle of contradictions between new and old ideas, we must strive to consciously make new ideas and communist ideas the main aspect of the contradiction, acting as the marshal; once this marshal takes command, old ideas and bourgeois ideas will be overcome. Our discussion meetings, praising the advanced and criticizing the backward, are a good way to support and help new ideas overcome old ideas. However, these methods are only a kind of external help for a person, and the key lies in the individual's consciousness. The help of comrades can only work through one's own subjective efforts. Often, after a criticism meeting, some people who have made mistakes become better, but there are also some people who have made mistakes and still have not made progress, and that is the reason. How can we improve consciousness? According to my experience, studying political theory hard, especially studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works, has the greatest enlightening and educational effect on people.

    “矛盾论”解决了我的思想矛盾
    解放军某部战士　程银锁
    我是人民解放军的一名列兵。入伍前只上过四年学，现在文化程度是高小水平。
    1957年春天，右派分子向党猖狂进攻，我心里极端愤恨，可是对右派分子的一些谬论，却不知道错在什么地方，不能对他们进行有力的驳斥，有时甚至还辨不清是非，划不清敌我界限。通过这场斗争，我深深感觉到：一个革命战士，一个共产党员，如果不认真学习政治理论，提高自己的认识，是十分危险的。从此，我下定决心要学习理论，学习哲学，学习毛主席的著作。
    两年以来，我已经读了“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”、“论共产党员的修养”等三十多本理论书籍，并写了十五万字的读书笔记。虽然学的还不深不透，可是自己的思想认识和理论水平已经有了一些提高。这里只就自己解决新旧思想的斗争问题来谈谈对“矛盾论”的体会。
    有一个和我同时入伍，同时入党的战士，文化水平比我还低，可是人家当了中士班长，我还是一个列兵。那时我想，人家真棒，咱可不行了。学习理论以后认识到，这种思想是资产阶级个人主义思想。不同的职务，只是革命事业中的不同分工，并没有高下贵贱的分别。当班长是重要的，干勤务帮助首长做些事情，也是重要的。当我认识了错误，对当列兵就有了更大的热情。现在我对普通一兵这个称号，感到很光荣。通过这场思想斗争，我认识到，如果共产主义思想战胜了个人主义思想，思想上的矛盾解决了，那么，就会前进一步；如果个人主义思想战胜了共产主义思想，那就糟糕了，就要犯错误。
    那么，当一个人产生了新旧思想的矛盾时，怎样才能保证新思想战胜旧思想呢？我的体会是，一方面要依靠党的领导和同志们的互相监督，另一方面也要依靠个人的自觉性。应该经常注意，在新旧思想的矛盾斗争中，要努力自觉地使新思想、共产主义思想成为矛盾的主要方面，充当元帅；这个元帅升了帐，旧思想、资产阶级思想就会被克服。我们开讨论会，表扬先进，批评落后，就是一套扶持和帮助新思想战胜旧思想的好办法。但是，这些办法，对于一个人来说，只是一种外力的帮助，关键还在于个人的自觉性。同志们的帮助，只有通过自己的主观努力才能起作用。常常一个批评会之后，有些犯了错误的人变好了，可是也有一些犯了错误的人仍然没有进步，就是这个道理。怎样才能提高自觉性呢？根据我的经验，努力学习政治理论，特别是学习毛主席的哲学著作，对人们的启发教育作用最大。
