Xinhua News Agency, 21st - American imperialism continues to carry out serious war threats in the sea near our country. Clark, commander of the US Seventh Fleet's Task Force 77, arrogantly clamored on the 20th that the five aircraft carriers of this fleet, with their "supersonic bombers and fighter planes, are operating at the same pace as during the Communist Chinese bombardment of Jinmen, and are fully loaded with nuclear bombs, ready to drop them on mainland China within an hour of notification."

Clark clamored that his "ships and planes are still patrolling the Formosa (Taiwan) Strait twenty-four hours a day." According to reports, the bomber pilots on the aircraft carriers such as the "Midway" are currently "on alert day and night," with teams of two or three bombers taking off every two or three hours.

At the same time, the United States has also strengthened its war deployment on Taiwan Island. According to reports, several "Nike-Hercules" missile launchers near Taipei are "fully prepared for launch."

In addition, according to a United Press International report, retired US Navy Admiral Cooke clamored in Sonoma, California, on the 20th that he "suggested drawing one or two battleships from the uncommissioned main force to prepare" to deal with the so-called "emergency in the Jinmen area." This former commander of the US Seventh Fleet clamored that the United States "is obligated under treaty and its own interests to defend" Jinmen, and "the most effective counter-fire would be the sixteen-inch guns on the battleships. Heavy cruisers could provide some supplementary guns." He wildly said that transporting these cannons into the Taiwan Strait area "would be the best guarantee against the intensified bombardment of Jinmen by the Communists."

    美国想吓唬吓不倒的人民
    克拉克之流又叫嚣要对我进行核战争
    新华社21日讯　美帝国主义继续在我国附近海面进行严重的战争威胁。美国第七舰队第七十七航空母舰特遣舰队司令克拉克20日狂妄地叫嚣说，这个舰队五艘航空母舰的“超音速轰炸机和战斗机在以共产党中国人炮击金门期间同样的步调进行活动，并且满载核炸弹，得到通知后一小时内就能够在大陆中国投掷”。
    克拉克叫嚣说，他的“舰只和飞机仍然二十四小时都在福摩萨（台湾）海峡巡逻”。消息说，目前，“中途号”等航空母舰上的轰炸机驾驶员们，正在“日夜处在戒备状态之中”，每两小时或三小时，便有两三架一队的轰炸机起飞。
    同时，美国在台湾岛上也加强了战争部署。消息说，台北附近有好几个“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹发射装置已经“完全作好发射的准备”。
    另据合众国际社消息，已退休的美国海军上将库克20日在加利福尼亚州索诺玛叫嚣说，他“建议在未服现役的主力舰中抽出一两艘来作好准备”，来对付所谓“金门地区的紧急事变”。这个前美国第七舰队司令叫嚣说，美国“根据条约和它自己的利益有义务来保卫”金门，而“最有效的还击炮火将是主力舰上的十六英寸的大炮。重巡洋舰可以提供一部分作补充用的大炮”。他猖狂地说，把这些大炮运入台湾海峡地区“将是对付加紧轰击金门的共产党人的最好保证”。
