    Gucheng Launches High-Efficiency Movement
    Labor Efficiency Doubles, Plowing and Planting Wheat Gets Faster Every Day
    (Our reporter Fang Di reports) Gucheng County, Hubei Province, has launched a mass high-efficiency movement. In the past month, although about half of the county's labor force has been diverted to large-scale steel production, the winter planting preparations, mainly deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation, have been completed very well. Currently, a massive winter planting movement has taken shape throughout the county.
    In mid-September, after a large number of laborers were put into steel production, the problem of insufficient rural labor became very prominent. At that time, cadres and masses in agricultural positions were not very stable in their emotions and lacked confidence. To this end, the Gucheng County Party Committee first educated cadres and the masses on the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and organized them to conduct large-scale debates. Through debates, they criticized the erroneous ideas of insufficient understanding of the significance of the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. On this basis, they also led cadres and the masses to carry out a mass "investigation and calculation" movement. The content of the investigation and calculation included: investigating solutions, calculating labor needs, investigating labor force, calculating work efficiency, investigating solutions, and arranging labor force, etc. After investigation and calculation, people found that there were still many loopholes in the past work, such as improper work arrangement and labor use and serious idling. Various localities believed that as long as they further improved labor organization and adopted various methods to improve work efficiency, they could do a good job in agricultural production while ensuring the task of steel production. The county party committee decided to launch a mass high-efficiency movement to overcome the contradiction of insufficient labor force, and called on cadres to take the lead in setting high-efficiency "satellites." After September 20, a mass high-efficiency movement quickly took shape throughout the county.
    The main content of the high-efficiency movement is: learning advanced technology, reforming production tools, improving labor organization, and improving labor proficiency. Socialist competitions were also carried out in the movement. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was very high, and various advanced figures and advanced deeds continued to emerge. Under the leadership of female production team leader Chen Zhihai, more than 400 women in the Ganping Joint Team of the New Life People's Commune learned to use plows for deep plowing in two or three days, with an average work efficiency of 2.5 mu per ox, which was about 1.5 times higher than the general level before the start of the movement. In the Shenwan Joint Team of the Dongfeng People's Commune, many people originally believed that it was difficult to improve the efficiency of manual deep plowing in hilly areas. Qiu Hongxuan, the secretary of the commune party committee, led cadres and shock team members to conduct trial plowing. They adopted a method of layered digging with tools such as iron shovels and iron forks, and also reasonably organized the labor force to eliminate idling. As a result, they achieved a rate of 0.05 mu of land plowed per person per day, increasing work efficiency by four times. Their achievements liberated the minds of the masses, who improved their digging techniques one after another, and successively created records of plowing more than 0.05 mu or even 0.08 mu of land per person per day; some masses also launched "satellites" of plowing six to eight mu of land per ox per day. The Cihe Joint Team of the New Atmosphere People's Commune transformed 50 double-furrow plows into 100 single-furrow plows, which not only increased work efficiency by more than one time, but also increased the cultivated layer from the original 7 inches to more than 1 foot. In terms of accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and sowing wheat and rapeseed, various communes also used methods such as organizing professional shock teams, selecting local materials for local processing, accumulating and delivering at the same time, and timely commending advanced figures and disseminating advanced experience to continuously improve work efficiency while ensuring quality.
    Because the mass high-efficiency movement played a huge role in overcoming the contradiction of insufficient labor force. In the past month, Gucheng County has completed its agricultural production tasks very well. Taking deep plowing as an example, each ox could only plow an average of 1 mu of land per day, but after the high-efficiency movement took shape, it quickly increased to 2 mu to 3 mu. Manual plowing originally only yielded about 0.01 mu per person per day, but after the start of the movement, it generally increased to 0.02 mu or 0.03 mu. The county originally planned to deep plow 350,000 mu of land, which was completed ahead of schedule by early October, and all were plowed to more than 1 foot; the 40,000 mu of "satellite" land planned to produce 10,000 jin of wheat per mu was generally deep plowed to about 3 feet. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, according to statistics, the winter planting fertilizer accumulated throughout the county has reached the requirement of more than 1,000 dan per mu, and most of it has been delivered to the fields, catching up with the needs of sowing. Because of this, the progress of sowing in Gucheng County is also faster than in previous years.

    谷城开展高工效运动
    劳动效率倍倍增　翻地种麦日日快
    本报讯　记者方堤报道：湖北省谷城县掀起了一个群众性的高工效运动。近一个月来，尽管全县抽调了大约一半的劳动力大办钢铁，但以深翻土地和积肥为主的各项冬播准备工作仍完成得很好。目前，一个声势浩大的冬播运动已经在全县形成。
    9月中旬，当大批劳动力投入钢铁生产以后，农村劳动力不足的问题显得十分突出。当时，农业工作岗位上的干部和群众情绪不大稳定，也缺乏信心。为此，中共谷城县委首先向干部和群众进行工农业同时并举的教育，并组织他们开展大辩论，通过辩论，批判了对工农业同时并举的意义认识不足的错误思想。在此基础上，又领导干部和群众开展了一个群众性的“查算”运动。查算的内容包括：查活路、算需工，查劳力、算工效，查活路、安排劳力等。经过查算以后，人们发现过去工作中还存在着很多漏洞，如像活路安排和劳力使用不当和窝工等严重情况。各地认为，只要进一步改善劳动组织，采用各种办法提高工效，是可以在确保钢铁生产任务的同时搞好农业生产的。县委决定开展群众性的高工效运动，来克服劳动力不足的矛盾，并号召干部带头放高工效“卫星”。9月20日以后，群众性的高工效运动迅速地在全县范围内形成了。
    高工效运动的主要内容是：学习先进技术、改革生产工具，改进劳动组织，提高劳动熟练程度等。在运动中又开展了社会主义竞赛。干部和群众的热情都很高涨，各种先进人物和先进事迹不断涌现。新生活人民公社甘坪联队有四百多个妇女在女生产队长陈治海的带动下，在两三天内就先后学会了用犁深翻，平均工效达到每犋牛二亩半，比运动开展前的一般水平高出一倍半左右。东风人民公社沈湾联队原来有不少人认为岗地用人工深翻效率很难提高，公社党委书记丘洪宣就带领干部和突击队员进行试翻。他们采用了铁锹、铁叉等工具分层挖的办法，还合理组织劳动力，消除了窝工现象，结果达到每人每天翻地五分，提高工效四倍。他们的成绩使广大群众解放了思想，纷纷改进挖地技术，接连创造出每人每天翻地五分以上甚至八分多的纪录；有的群众还放出了用一犋牛每天翻地六亩到八亩的“卫星”。新气象人民公社茨河联队把五十部双铧犁改装为一百部单铧犁，不但提高工效一倍多，而且耕层也由原来的七寸提高到一尺以上。在积肥、造肥和播种小麦、油菜方面，各公社也用组织专业突击队、就地选材就地加工、边积边送和及时表扬先进人物、传播先进经验等作法，在保证质量的前提下不断提高工效。
    由于开展群众性的高工效运动，对于克服劳动力不足的矛盾起了巨大作用。将近一个月来，谷城县农业生产任务完成得很好。以深翻土地为例，原来每犋牛每天平均只能翻地一亩，当高工效运动形成以后，即迅速提高为二亩到三亩。用人工翻地，原来每人每天只一分左右，运动开展后普遍提高到二分、三分。全县原计划深翻的三十五万亩地，到10月上旬提前完成了，而且都翻到一尺以上；四万亩计划亩产小麦万斤以上的“卫星”地，普遍深翻到三尺左右。积肥方面，据统计，全县积的冬播肥料已达到了每亩千担以上的要求，绝大部分都已经送到地里，赶上了播种的需要。正因为这样，目前谷城县播种工作进度也较往年迅速。
