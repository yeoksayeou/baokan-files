The entire factory is a military camp
Following the arming of the entire population at the Shijingshan Power Plant, a series of changes have taken place in the people's mindset and in production and construction.
By our reporter Lian Yunshan
The Shijingshan Power Plant is now a factory where management is militarized, life is collectivized, and production operations are combat-oriented.
The arming of the entire factory has brought a series of new changes to the people's mindset and to production and construction.

Ideals Realized
In September, the U.S. Air Force and Navy assembled in the Taiwan Strait and frequently carried out military provocations against our country. Under the Party's call for "arming the entire population," the factory's workers were eager to participate in militia organizations, learn military techniques, and prepare to support the liberation of Taiwan and defend the motherland. Soon, the Shijingshan Power Plant Workers' Militia Regiment was formally established. Subsequently, comrades who were veterans of the People's Liberation Army and had been transferred to the factory served as instructors, using their spare time every day to begin intensive military training. Now, the entire factory has completed basic military movements and basic shooting training. They have also adopted methods of sending people to the military for "study" and inviting military comrades to the factory for training, learning radar operation, radio communication, anti-aircraft machine gun, and anti-aircraft artillery techniques, cooperating with the military to undertake air combat tasks.

Militarized Actions, Renewed Thoughts
"To all commanders and fighters of the regiment: Please attend a report at the auditorium at 6:30 p.m. tonight. Please arrive on time. The seating positions for each battalion are as follows (diagram)
\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRegiment Headquarters"
This is a meeting notice posted at the gate of the Shijingshan Power Plant on the 17th of this month. After arming the entire factory, the militia military organization and the production organization were completely integrated. The director and deputy director of the factory are the regiment commander and deputy regiment commander of the militia, and the Party committee secretary is the political commissar. The chief engineer is the chief of staff, the engineers are the staff officers, and other responsible comrades of the Party and the Communist Youth League are the directors of the political department. The organization of companies, platoons, and squads is consistent with that of work sections, teams, and groups. Because after the arming of the entire factory, people demand of themselves the cultivation of the People's Liberation Army and the ideological style of soldiers, it is more convenient to carry out work and leadership with military organizations. In the past, it took at least half an hour for people to arrive when a workshop meeting was called, and this was even more true for factory-wide meetings. Now, meetings are attended by battalions and companies in formation, arriving ahead of time. Before the meeting, they cheer and sing to each other, "First Company, give us a song!" "Third Company, sing quickly!" Everyone's mood is high, and their enthusiasm is great. In the past, many people couldn't sing collectively, and a few workers liked to sing things like "Little Sister Sings, the Boy Plays the Qin." Now, this situation is gone forever. Workers go to work, attend meetings, and practice martial arts in formation, singing "I Am a Soldier," "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention," "Song of the Navy," and other new revolutionary songs. They learn many songs and sing them happily.
Eighty percent of this factory are young workers. In the past, they would stroll down the street, chat idly, and often quarrel and fight when they returned to the dormitory, reading yellow novels. Now, these situations have been replaced by the organized, healthy, and beneficial activities of the militia; in their spare time, they either practice aiming and shooting, disassembling and assembling weapons, teaching each other, and learning from each other, or engage in various sports activities. The militia organization also frequently invites demobilized soldiers to tell revolutionary historical combat stories. The head of the militia regiment and factory director, Comrade Zhang Guinan, and the demobilized PLA company commander, Comrade Zhang Caiyun, are often surrounded by young workers, listening to their stories of past wars. The Party and Youth League leaders also widely organize the militia to read literary books and periodicals reflecting the combat stories of the People's Liberation Army. For example, the book "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" is now available in every youth collective dormitory, with a maximum of three or four copies. The young people take the noble qualities of Shao Jianbo, Yang Zirong, and others as their role models and often talk about them.

The Glorious Example of the People's Liberation Army is Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts
The Spirit of Daring Combat is Greatly Promoted
In the context of U.S. imperialism's military threat to our country and the great development of the people's commune movement throughout the country, workers felt that ordinary leaps forward were no longer satisfactory. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army's fighting spirit, which feared no difficulties, became their example. They put forward the slogan "Use the PLA's spirit of fighting to engage in production." Soon after the militia was established, they worked hard day and night and proposed 9,200 rationalization proposals, overcoming 42 technical barriers, greatly promoting production. Recently, the factory wanted to produce steel on a large scale and needed coke. The militia battalions took advantage of their spare time to engage in a major battle. They launched competitions between companies, platoons, and squads at the construction site. As a result, they moved 500,000 bricks in just four hours, built twelve coke ovens, and completed the ignition. The combat-assault style of the militia organization has played a huge role in promoting the factory's normal production and expansion.
When reporters accompanied representatives of the National Militia Work Conference to visit the factory, Party Committee Secretary Li Ximing said: After the workers were approved to participate in the militia, everyone underwent ideological changes, and they considered this to be the greatest honor. At the same time, due to the implementation of militarization, collectivization, and combat readiness, the organizational discipline and collectivist spirit of cadres and workers have also been greatly improved. Therefore, not only are more things done faster, but people's spiritual life is also more pleasant and rich, and they also rest better. Those who were worried that militarization would affect workers' rest and production have now changed their views. At the same time, because after their militarization, all production organizations hold regular life review meetings in accordance with the PLA's military democracy, political democracy, and economic democracy, launching criticism and self-criticism between superiors and subordinates and between people; the resolution and decision of various production and technical issues are all based on the leaders first proposing a plan, submitting it to the masses for democratic discussion, offering suggestions and strategies, and then concentrating it before implementing it. Therefore, the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between people is closer, and democratic life is more active.

    全厂皆兵
    石景山发电厂全民武装以后，给人们的思想面貌和生产建设带来了一系列的变化。
    本报记者　连云山
    石景山发电厂，现在是工厂管理军事化，生活集体化，生产行动战斗化的一个工厂。
    全厂皆兵给人们的思想面貌和生产建设带来了一系列的新变化。
    理想实现了
    9月间，美国海空军集结台湾海峡，对我国频繁地进行军事挑衅。在党的“全民皆兵”号召下，这个厂的工人纷纷磨拳擦掌，一致要求参加民兵组织，学习军事技术，准备为支援解放台湾，保卫祖国而战。很快地，正式组成了石景山发电厂工人民兵团。接着，由解放军退伍到厂的同志担任教员，利用每天的业余时间开始了紧张的军事训练。现在全厂已学完了军人基本动作和射击基本教练。他们还采取派人到部队去“留学”和邀请部队同志来厂教练的办法，学会雷达操纵，无线电通讯，高射机枪和高射炮技术，配合部队担任对空战斗任务。
    行动军事化思想日日新
    “全团指战员同志们：今晚六时半在礼堂听报告，请准时到达。各营入座位置如下（图示）
                             团指挥部”
    这是石景山发电厂本月17日贴在大门口的一张开会通知。全厂皆兵后，民兵军事组织同生产组织完全合一了。正副厂长就是民兵团的正副团长，党委书记就是政治委员。总工程师是参谋长，工程师是参谋，党团其它负责同志就是政治处主任。营长、教导员由各车间主任和总支书记担任。连、排、班的组织，也同工段、班、组是一致的。由于全厂皆兵后，人们都以人民解放军的修养和战士的思想作风要求自己，因此以军事组织进行工作更便利于生产和领导。从前车间开会，人们至少得半小时才能到齐，全厂开会更是如此。现在开会是以营、连为单位整队入场，提前到达。会前互相啦啦唱歌，“第一连，来一个”“第三连，快唱吧！”大伙情绪很高，劲头很大。过去很多人不会集体唱歌，少数工人爱唱些什么“小妹妹唱歌郎奏琴”之类。现在这种情况已经一去不返了。工人们上班、开会、练武，都是整队合唱“我是一个兵”、“三大纪律、八项注意”、
  “海军之歌”等新的革命歌曲。他们的歌子学得多，唱的欢。
    这个厂有80％是青年工人，在从前，他们有空闲时间就蹓大街，扯乱谈，回宿舍后常爱斗嘴打架，看黄色小说。现在，这些情况，已被民兵有组织的健康有益的活动所代替；在业余时间里，或者是练习瞄准射击，分解、安装武器，互教互学。或者是做各种体育活动。民兵组织还经常请复员军人讲革命历史战斗故事。民兵团长、厂长张桂楠同志，复员的解放军连长张彩云同志，都常常被青年工人围得水泄不通，听他们讲过去的战争故事。党团领导还广泛组织民兵阅读反映解放军战斗故事的文艺书刊，像“林海雪源”一书，现在每个青年集体宿舍都有一本，最多的有三、四本，青年们都把少剑波、杨子荣等人的高尚品质作为自己的学习榜样，经常谈论着。
    解放军光辉榜样深入人心
    突击战斗作风大大发扬
    在美帝国主义对我国进行军事威胁和全国人民公社运动大发展的情况下，工人们感到一般的跃进已不满足。于是，解放军不怕任何困难的战斗精神就成了他们的榜样。他们提出了“要用解放军打仗的劲头搞生产”。在民兵刚成立以后，他们苦战一昼夜，就提出了九千二百条合理化建议，攻克了四十二个技术堡垒，大大推动了生产。最近厂里要大炼钢，需要焦炭。各营民兵们又利用业余时间大干了一场。他们在工地展开了连与连、排与排、班与班的比赛，结果只四个小时便搬运了五十万块砖，砌起了十二座炼焦炉，并且点火完毕。民兵组织的战斗突击作风，对这个厂的正常生产和扩建起了巨大的推动作用。
    记者随全国民兵工作会议代表访问这个工厂时，党委书记李锡铭同志说：工人群众被批准参加民兵后，每一个人都有思想变化，他们认为这是最大的光荣。同时，由于军事化、集体化和战斗化的实行，干部和工人的组织性、纪律性和集体主义精神也大大提高。因此不但事情做得又多，又快，而且人们的精神生活也更愉快、丰富，休息得也更好了。曾经耽心军事化会影响工人休息和生产的人，现在也转变了这种看法。同时，因为他们军事化以后，各个生产组织都按照解放军军事民主、政治民主、经济民主那样定期召开生活检讨会，上下之间、人与人之间互相展开批评和自我批评；各项生产、技术等问题的解决、决定，都是领导先提出方案，交群众民主讨论，献计献策，然后集中起来再付诸实行。因此，使上下之间、人与人之间的关系更加亲密，民主生活更为活跃了。
