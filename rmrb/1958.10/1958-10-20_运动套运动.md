Whatsoever matter, provided it requires the majority of people to undertake it, using the form of mass movement to accomplish it will always result in faster and better completion. This point has been proven by countless experiences. In GuCheng County, Hubei Province, half of the rural labor force was diverted to steel production, yet the remaining manpower was able to successfully undertake the arduous tasks of deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and winter sowing, and to complete them very well. The "magic weapon" relied upon by this county was the mass movement. This county launched a "high work efficiency movement" with the content of studying advanced technology, reforming production tools, improving labor organization, and improving labor proficiency, which greatly accelerated the progress of deep plowing. Originally, deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and winter sowing were already large-scale mass movements. GuCheng County launched a movement with the goal of improving labor efficiency within this movement. This is a large movement encompassing a small movement, and the small movement solves the key to the large movement—overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor. Under the current situation of the great leap forward in agriculture, large movements must be carried out, and small movements that serve the large movements are also worth promoting. In fact, small movements are also components of large movements. Vigorously launching mass movements, with movements within movements, is our Party's "magic weapon," and the most important guarantee for completing various tasks quickly, well, and economically.

    运动套运动
    不论什么事情，只要是需要多数人去干的，运用群众运动的形式完成它，总是会完成得更快更好。这点已为无数的经验所证明。湖北省谷城县一半农村劳动力抽出搞钢铁生产去了，剩下的人力却能胜利地担负起深耕、积肥和冬播的繁重任务，而且完成得很好。这个县所凭借的“法宝”就是群众运动。这个县开展了一个以学习先进技术、改革生产工具、改进劳动组织、提高劳动熟练程度为内容的“高工效运动”，使深翻地进度大大加快。本来深耕、积肥和冬播就是一个大规模的群众运动，谷城县在这个运动中又开展了以提高劳动效率为目标的运动，这是大运动套小运动，而小运动所解决的正是大运动的关键——克服劳力不足的困难。在当前农业大跃进的形势下，大运动是非搞不可的，而为大运动服务的小运动也是值得提倡的，事实上小运动也就是大运动的组成部分。大搞群众运动，运动中套运动，这是我们党的“法宝”，这是多快好省地完成各项工作的最重要的保证。
