They unanimously agreed to issue a "Joint Statement by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association." The two sides held a signing ceremony for the joint statement on the evening of the 10th.

Signing on behalf of the Chinese Red Cross Society were Hu Lansheng, Wu Yunfu, Zhao Anbo, and Ni Feijun.

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: The full text of the joint statement by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China Peace Committee, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and the Delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association is as follows:

Since its establishment nine years ago, the Japan-China Friendship Association has consistently worked to promote friendship between China and Japan. Last year, it also issued a joint statement with the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, China Peace Committee, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and the Chinese Red Cross Society to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and to promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The Kishida government's policy of following the United States and adopting a hostile attitude towards China has led to the interruption of all relations between China and Japan. However, at this very moment, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, at the invitation of the Chinese People's Friendship Association, visited the People's Republic of China and participated in the Ninth National Day celebrations. This proves that despite the Kishida government's hostile policy towards China, the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples has never changed.

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and representatives of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China People's Peace Committee, and the Chinese Red Cross Society held talks in a friendly atmosphere on enhancing the friendship between the two peoples and on the current Taiwan Strait issue, and reached a consensus:

(1) Today, the people-to-people exchanges and cooperation between China and Japan, which have been built up through years of effort, have been interrupted due to the Kishida government's hostile policy towards China. In order to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association resolutely expresses its determination to launch a nationwide struggle to force the Kishida government to change its policy. Representatives of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and other relevant organizations emphasized that the Chinese people's attitude towards the Kishida government is different from their attitude towards the Japanese people. The Chinese people, whether in the past, present, or future, welcome friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between the two peoples. The Chinese people's friendly attitude towards the peace-loving Japanese people will never change.

(2) Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu have been an integral part of Chinese territory since ancient times. However, the United States is currently occupying Taiwan and Penghu, and has concentrated strong military forces in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, engaging in armed intervention and war provocations, and obstructing the People's Republic of China from liberating Kinmen, Matsu, and other coastal islands, as well as Taiwan and Penghu. This is clearly interference in and infringement upon the internal affairs and sovereignty of the People's Republic of China, and a threat to peace in Asia. The Chinese people demand that the American aggressors withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship supports the just demands of the Chinese people. The United States has established huge military bases in various parts of Japan, including Okinawa, undermining Japan's independence, suppressing the Japanese people, and transporting atomic weapons into Japan, while using Japan as a base for armed aggression against the Taiwan Strait area. The Japanese people oppose these aggressive acts by the United States, the Chinese People's Friendship Association and other relevant Chinese organizations express support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association resolutely expresses its determination to work with the Japanese people to demand that the Kishida government immediately abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the "Japan-Taiwan Treaty," refuse to support the U.S. war policy, and refuse the use of Japanese military bases by the U.S. military. The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the relevant Chinese organizations express their support for this determination.

The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association believes that any attempt to separate Taiwan and Penghu from the People's Republic of China and create a "two Chinas" conspiracy, or to submit the Taiwan issue to the United Nations in an attempt to use the United Nations to "legitimize" the American occupation of Taiwan, is an interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, a violation of the United Nations Charter, and should be resolutely opposed.

(3) The delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association reiterates that the deterioration of relations between Japan and China and the interruption of trade and fisheries are the result of the Kishida government's policy of following the United States and being hostile to China. In order to create conditions for the resumption of trade and fisheries relations, the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association expresses its determination to fight together with the Japanese people to demand that the Kishida government change its hostile policy towards China, abandon the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and stop hindering the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

    尽管岸信介政府敌视中国两国人民友谊始终未变
    新华社10日讯  中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国红十字会总会，日前在北京同前来我国进行访问的日本中国友好协会访华代表团，就增进中日两国人民的友谊以及关于当前的台湾海峡问题进行了会谈，一致同意发表“中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国红十字会总会和日本中国友好协会访华代表团的共同声明”，双方并在10日晚间举行了共同声明的签字仪式。

    代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会签字的是廖承志和王明远。
    代表中国红十字会总会签字的是胡兰生、伍云甫、赵安博和倪斐君。

    新华社10日讯　中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国红十字会和日本中国友好协会访华代表团的共同声明，全文如下：
    日中友好协会从九年前成立以来，一贯为了增进中日两国之间的友好进行了努力。去年还为增进中日两国人民的友谊，促使中日邦交正常化，同中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民外交学会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国国际贸易促进委员会以及中国红十字会发表了共同声明。
    岸信介政府采取追随美国，采取敌视中国的政策，使中日之间的一切关系陷于中断，但是就在这个时候，日中友好协会访华代表团应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请，访问了中华人民共和国，参加了第九届国庆节。这就证明了：尽管岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，中日两国人民之间的友谊却始终没有改变。
    日中友好协会访华代表团同中国人民对外文化协会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国红十字会的代表在友好的气氛中，就增进两国人民的友谊和当前的台湾海峡问题进行了会谈，并且取得了一致的意见：
      （一）今天，中日两国人民经过多年努力建立起来的民间往来和合作已经由于岸信介政府敌视中国的政策而中断了。为加强两国人民的友好和合作，日中友好协会访华代表团坚决表示决心为迫使岸信介政府改变政策而展开全民斗争。中国人民对外文化协会等有关团体的代表强调指出：中国人民对待岸信介政府和对待日本人民的态度是有区别的，中国人民无论在过去、现在和将来，都欢迎两国人民之间的友好往来和文化交流。中国人民对爱好和平的日本人民的友好态度始终不会改变。
    （二）台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖自古以来就是中国领土的一部分，然而目前美国却占领了台湾和澎湖，并且在台湾和台湾海峡地区集中了强大的军事力量，进行武力干涉和战争挑衅，阻挠中华人民共和国解放金门、马祖等沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖。这显然是干涉和侵犯中华人民共和国的内政和主权，威胁亚洲的和平。中国人民要求美国侵略军撤出台湾及台湾海峡地区。日中友好协会访华代表团支持中国人民的正义要求。美国在日本各地，包括冲绳在内，建立了庞大的军事基地，破坏日本独立，压制日本人民，并将原子武器运进日本，同时把日本作为基地对台湾海峡地区进行武装侵略。日本人民反对美国这些侵略行为，中国人民对外文化协会等中国有关团体对日本人民的正义斗争表示支持。日中友好协会访华代表团坚决表示决心和日本人民一起，要求岸信介政府立即废除日美安全条约和“日台条约”，拒绝支持美国的战争政策，拒绝美国军队利用日本的军事基地，中国人民对外文化协会等中国有关团体表示支持这一决心。
    日中友好协会访华代表团认为无论是把台湾、澎湖从中华人民共和国中分裂出去，制造“两个中国”的阴谋，或是把台湾问题提交联合国，企图利用联合国使美国占领台湾“合法化”的阴谋，都是干涉中华人民共和国的内政，都是违反联合国宪章的，应该坚决予以反对。
      （三）日中友好协会访华代表团重申日中两国关系的恶化和贸易、渔业的中断是岸信介政府追随美国，敌视中国政策的结果。为了创造条件恢复贸易和渔业关系，日中友好协会访华代表团表示决心和日本人民共同进行斗争，要求岸信介政府改变敌视中国的政策，放弃制造“两个中国”的阴谋，停止阻挠日中两国恢复邦交。中国人民对外文化协会等中国有关团体表示：如果岸信介政府彻底改变敌视中国的政策，并且采取必要的具体措施，那么，可以考虑在改善贸易、渔业等关系上予以协助。日中友好协会访华代表团还对中国方面热情协助一般日侨、探亲妇女和被释放的战犯回国表示感谢，并且希望中国今后继续予以协助。对此中国方面表示同意。日中友好协会访华代表团确认长崎的污辱中国国旗的事件和刘连仁问题是岸信介政府敌视中国的政策所引起的，并表示决心要求日本政府必须合理解决这些问题，调查在战争中被掳到日本的中国人民的情况和提供名单，并收集和送还牺牲了的中国殉难烈士的遗骨。中国方面对此表示关心并完全予以支持。
