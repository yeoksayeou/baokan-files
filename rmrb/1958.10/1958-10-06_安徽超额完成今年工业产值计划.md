Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Anhui Province has achieved great success on the industrial production front this year, exceeding the annual industrial production output value plan in just nine months. As of September 30th, the province's industrial production output value had already reached 177.2% of the 1958 annual plan, 377.5% of the output value for the same period last year.

In implementing this year's industrial production plan, steel production ranked first. By the end of September, the province had produced more than 253,000 tons of pig iron and more than 10,000 tons of steel. Taking steel as the key link, it drove the great leap forward in various industries throughout the province. According to statistics on thirty-seven major industrial products, eleven products have completed the annual output plan, and ten products have completed more than 75% of the annual plan. In the past nine months, more than 1,000 new industrial products have been successfully trial-produced, including diesel engines, water turbines, and gas engines. In the past, these products relied entirely on support from other regions, but now the province can produce them in large quantities or partially produce them.

The characteristic of Anhui Province's completion of this year's industrial production plan is: the masses are running factories and mines on a large scale. There are more than 880,000 industrial production factories and mines in the province, of which more than 680,000 have been put into production. The small factories and mines built by the masses below the county level account for 99% of the total number of newly built factories and mines put into production in the province. The province has already achieved the goal of having factories in every township and commune.

    安徽超额完成今年工业产值计划
    据新华社讯　今年安徽省在工业生产战线上获得了很大成就，九个月就超额完成了全年工业生产产值计划。截至9月30日止，全省工业生产产值已经完成1958年年度计划的177.2％，为去年同期产值的377.5％。
    在执行今年工业生产计划中，钢铁生产居于首位，到9月底，全省生产生铁二十五万三千多吨，钢一万多吨，以钢为纲，带动了全省各项工业的大跃进。根据三十七种主要工业产品的统计，已经有十一种产品完成了年度产量计划，有十种产品完成了年度计划75％以上。在九个月中，试制成功了一千多种工业新产品，其中有柴油机、水轮机、煤气机等，这些产品过去全靠外地支援，现在省内已经能够大量生产或部分地生产。
    安徽省完成今年工业生产计划的特点是：群众大办厂矿。全省有工业生产厂矿八十八万多个，其中投入生产的有六十八万多个，而县以下群众兴办的小型厂矿即占全省新建投入生产的厂矿总数99％。全省已作到乡乡社社都办工厂。
