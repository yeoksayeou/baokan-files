    Large Planetarium
    A planetarium is an optical instrument for observing the universe and the starry sky. It can represent the movement of celestial bodies in a short period of time. In addition, there are many other auxiliary instruments used to simulate comets, meteors, auroras, etc., creating an artificial starry sky.
    Through the planetarium's performance, you can see the movement of the sun, planets, and stars; the alternation of day and night; the movement of the Earth and the six major planets (Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn) in the sky; and their positions in the universe tens of thousands of years ago and tens of thousands of years later. Other sky phenomena such as solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, comets, meteor showers, and auroras can also be seen.
    The use of artificial instruments to observe sky phenomena originated in China. Zhang Heng, an astronomer of the Eastern Han Dynasty (78-139 AD), once created a armillary sphere that was rotated by water leakage. It could show the rising and setting of stars, which completely matched the real celestial phenomena seen outdoors. Nowadays, when countries around the world talk about the history of planetariums, most of them regard Zhang Heng's armillary sphere as the founder. Therefore, the birth of the first large planetarium has special significance.
    Planetariums are divided into three types: large, medium, and small. Only the German Zeiss factory can manufacture large planetariums. There are a total of twenty-nine. The large planetarium at the Beijing Planetarium in China is the thirtieth in the world. Ten of these planetariums were destroyed in World War II. (Attached picture)

    大型天象仪
    天象仪是一种观察宇宙星空情况的光学仪器，它能够在短时间内，把天体的运动表示出来，此外还有许多其它的附属仪器，用来表演彗星、流星、极光等等，造成一个人造星空。
    通过天象仪的表演，可以看见太阳、行星、恒星的运行情况；昼夜交替的情况；地球和金、木、水、火、土六大行星在空中的运动情况；以及几万年前和几万年后它们在宇宙间的位置，其它还有日蚀、月蚀、彗星、流星雨、北极光等天空现象，都可以看到。
    用人造仪器来观察天空现象起源于我国，东汉时代的天文学家张衡（公元78—139年）曾经创造过用漏水来转动的浑天仪，它可以看到星星的东升西落，和室外所看到的真正天象完全符合。现今，世界各国谈到天象仪的历史，多半是以张衡的浑天仪为开山鼻祖，因此，第一台大型天象仪的诞生，具有特殊的意义。
    天象仪分大、中、小三种。大型天象仪在世界上只有德国蔡斯工厂能制造，一共有二十九架，我国北京天文馆的大型天象仪是世界上的第三十架。这些天象仪在第二次世界大战中被毁掉十架。（附图片）
