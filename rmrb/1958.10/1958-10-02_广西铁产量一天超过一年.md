This newspaper's Nanning, 1st dispatch: The three million iron and steel army, fighting day and night on Guangxi's iron and steel front, under the slogans of producing more iron and producing iron faster, to offer gifts to National Day and to demonstrate to American imperialism, in a day and night battle from 00:00 to 24:00 on the 29th, with an astonishing speed more than nine times faster than the usual daily production, smelted 4,553 tons of pig iron.

This leap forward is a starting point for Guangxi's iron and steel production to enter large-scale production. Guangxi's iron and steel industrial base was very weak in the past, and the production quantity was very low. The pig iron production on the 29th exceeded the total annual output of 3,895 tons last year by 658 tons, and exceeded the highest daily output of 420.48 tons on September 27 by more than nine times.

On the 29th, the Liuzhou Special Zone, where the Zhuang ethnic group is concentrated, produced a total of 3,679.92 tons of iron, becoming a high-yield special zone for daily pig iron production in the entire autonomous region. On this day, two satellite counties with a daily pig iron production of 1,000 tons appeared in this special zone. Among them, Luocheng had the highest, with a daily pig iron production of 1,052 tons. Second only to Luocheng County was Huanjiang County, which produced 1,014.4 tons of iron.

    广西铁产量一天超过一年
    本报南宁1日电　日夜奋战在广西钢铁战线上的三百万钢铁大军，在多出铁、快出铁，向国庆节献礼，向美帝国主义示威的口号下，在29日零时到二十四时一昼夜的鏖战中，以比平常日产数量快九倍多的惊人速度，炼出生铁四千五百五十三吨。
    这次跃进是广西钢铁生产进入大生产的一个起点。广西过去钢铁工业基础十分薄弱，生产数量很低。29日的生铁产量，比去年全年产量总和三千八百九十五吨还超过六百五十八吨，比最高日产量9月27日的四百二十点四八吨超过九倍多。
    在29日，僮族聚集的柳州专区共产生铁三千六百七十九点九二吨，成为全自治区日产生铁的高产专区。这个专区在这一天出现两个日产生铁千吨的卫星县，其中以罗城为最高，日产生铁一千零五十二吨，仅次于罗城县的是环江县，产生铁一千零一十四点四吨。
