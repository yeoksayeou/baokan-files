A Little Song for the Front Lines (Peking Opera)
Words by Tian Han, Sung by Mei Lanfang

(Nan Bangzi) Just to meet the heroes on the front lines, crossing the Yellow River and the Yangtze to reach Jiangnan. Along the way, small earthen furnaces gleam red, all of China has become like a steel plant. Just leaving the gentle waters of West Lake, in an instant, iron horses arrive at Yingtan. The Yingxia Railway, a project unparalleled in the world, passes through the layered peaks and overlapping ridges of the Wuyi Mountains, with the Futun River
(Transition to Er Liu) accompanying me, sending me to Gulangyu in Minjiang. The U.S. imperialists are unwilling to accept their defeat in China, supporting the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, using Jinmen and Matsu as stepping stones, they even妄想to return to the mainland and regain the throne. Our coastal defense soldiers are truly brave
(Transition to Allegro) beating them until the waves roll and churn. The People's Liberation Army are all heroes like Zhou Chu and Wu Song, their hearts are uneasy until the motherland's territory is liberated. It has always been easy to catch tigers on the mountain, what difficulty is there in slaying dragons in the sea. Stop and fight as we please, first, we must speak of national righteousness. Work hard with wisdom and courage, the red flag will be planted in Taiwan soon. If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade,
(Transition to Scattered Rhythm) we will ensure that not a single piece of their armor remains!

    慰问前线小唱（京剧）
    田汉词  梅兰芳唱
  （南梆子）都只为到前线和英雄会见，跨黄河渡扬子来到江南。一路上，土高炉，红光灿烂，全中国都成了钢厂一般。才离了西子湖上温水软，一霎时铁马到鹰潭。鹰厦路，工程天下险，穿过了层峦叠嶂的武夷山，富屯溪水
  （转二六）来相伴，送我到闽江鼓岭间。美帝在中国失败他心不甘，支持蒋匪卖国集团，金门马祖当跳板，他竟妄想回大陆重上金銮。我海防将士真勇敢
  （转快板）打得他浪滚波又翻。解放军尽都是周处武松英雄
  汉，不解放祖国领土心不安。上山擒虎从来易，入海斩蛟又何难。停停打打随我便，先把那民族大义说一番。智勇双全努力干，红旗指日插台湾。美帝胆敢来侵犯，
  （转散板）管叫他片甲不复还！
