Xinhua News Agency, October 25th -- The text of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China's second message to Taiwan compatriots is as follows:

To the Military and Civilian Compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu:

We fully understand that the vast majority of you are patriotic, and only a tiny minority are willing to be slaves of the Americans. Compatriots, Chinese affairs can only be resolved by us Chinese ourselves. If it is difficult to resolve temporarily, we can discuss it over a longer period. The American political broker Dulles, a busybody, wants to stick his hand into the historical disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, ordering the Chinese to do this and that, harming the interests of the Chinese people and suiting the interests of the Americans. That is to say, the first step is to isolate Taiwan; the second step is to put Taiwan under trusteeship. If this does not succeed, the most vicious means can be used. Do you know how General Zhang Zuolin died? There is a place called Huanggu Village in the Northeast, and he was killed there. Imperialist elements in the world have no conscience. American imperialists are particularly ferocious, at least no less than the Japanese who killed Zhang Zuolin. Compatriots, I advise you to be careful. I advise you not to be too dependent on others, letting them take away all your power. The matters between our two parties are easy to handle. I have ordered the Fujian Front to not bomb the Kinmen airport, the Liaoluo Bay wharf, the beaches, and ships on even-numbered days, so that the military and civilian compatriots on the large and small islands of Greater Kinmen, Lesser Kinmen, Greater Dadan, and Lesser Dadan will have sufficient supplies, including food, vegetables, cooking oil, fuel, and military equipment, to facilitate your long-term defense. If there is a shortage, we can supply it as long as you ask. Now is the time to turn enemies into friends. On odd-numbered days, your ships and planes should not come. We may not necessarily fire artillery on odd-numbered days, but you should not come to avoid possible losses. In this way, you can transport supplies for half the month, and the supply can be guaranteed. Some of you suspect that we want to disintegrate the unity between your military and civilians, and between officers and soldiers. Compatriots, no, we hope you strengthen your unity in order to resist foreign aggression together. The on-again, off-again, half-attack, half-stop situation is not a trick, but a normal product of the current specific situation. We will not bomb airports, wharves, beaches, and ships, still on the condition that no American escorts are introduced. If there are escorts, this will not apply. At the Chiang-Dulles talks, you suffered a little loss; you only have the right to speak on behalf of "Free China"; plus a small number of overseas Chinese, and you are allowed to represent them as well. The Americans have sealed you off as a small China. On October 23rd, the U.S. State Department released Dulles' remarks to a reporter from a British broadcasting company on October 16th. Dulles took off from Taiwan, and the remarks were issued. He said that he saw a Communist China, and that this country really exists and is willing to deal with it, and so on. Thank God, our country has been seen by an American master. This is a big China. The Americans, forced by the situation, have changed their policy and regard you as a "de facto existing political entity," but not as a country. This "de facto existing political entity" is still needed by the Americans in the first stage that is now beginning. This is to isolate Taiwan. The second stage is to put Taiwan under trusteeship. Kuomintang friends, don't you feel this danger yet? What is the way out? Please think about it. The communique of the Chiang-Dulles talks is just a public announcement and has no legal effect. It is easy to get rid of it, depending on whether you have the determination. There is only one China in the world, not two Chinas. We are united on this point. The American trick of forcibly creating two Chinas will absolutely not be allowed to be realized by all Chinese people, including you and overseas Chinese. The present era is an era full of hope, and all patriots have a way out. Don't be afraid of any imperialists. Of course, we are not advising you to break with the Americans immediately; such a thought is unrealistic. We only hope that you will not succumb to American pressure, follow others blindly, lose your sovereignty, and finally end up with nowhere to stand and be thrown into the sea. These words of ours are well-intentioned, not malicious, and you will gradually understand them in the future.

Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai

    国防部彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞
    中国人的事只能由中国人自己解决
    一切爱国者都有出路，不要怕帝国主义者。决不能让美国人制造两个中国的阴谋得逞不要屈服于美国人的压力，随人俯仰，丧失主权，最后存身无地，被人丢到大海里去
    新华社25日讯　中华人民共和国国防部再告台湾同胞书，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国国防部再告台湾同胞书台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖军民同胞们：
    我们完全明白，你们绝大多数都是爱国的，甘心做美国人奴隶的只有极少数。同胞们，中国人的事只能由我们中国人自己解决。一时难于解决，可以从长商议。美国的政治掮客杜勒斯，爱管闲事，想从国共两党的历史纠纷这件事情中间插进一只手来，命令中国人做这样，做那样，损害中国人的利益，适合美国人的利益。就是说，第一步，孤立台湾；第二步，托管台湾。如不遂意，最毒辣的手段，都可以拿出来。你们知道张作霖将军是怎样死去的么？东北有一个皇姑屯，他就是在那里被人治死的。世界上的帝国主义分子都没有良心。美帝国主义者尤为凶恶，至少不下于治死张作霖的日本人。同胞们，我劝你们当心一点儿。我劝你们不要过于依人篱下，让人家把一切权柄都拿了去。我们两党间的事情很好办。我已命令福建前线，逢双日不打金门的飞机场、料罗湾的码头、海滩和船只，使大金门、小金门、大担、二担大小岛屿上的军民同胞都得到充分的供应，包括粮食、蔬菜、食油、燃料和军事装备在内，以利你们长期固守。如有不足，只要你们开口，我们可以供应。化敌为友，此其时矣。逢单日，你们的船只、飞机不要来。逢单日我们也不一定打炮，但是你们不要来，以免受到可能的损失。这样，一个月中有半月可以运输，供应可以无缺。你们有些人怀疑，我们要瓦解你们军民之间官兵之间的团结。同胞们，不，我们希望你们加强团结，以便一致对外。打打停停，半打半停，不是诡计，而是当前具体情况下的正常产物。不打飞机场、码头、海滩、船只，仍以不引进美国人护航为条件。如有护航，不在此例。蒋、杜会谈，你们吃了一点亏，你们只有代表“自由中国”发言的权利了；再加上小部分华侨，还许你们代表他们。美国人把你们封为一个小中国。十月二十三日，美国国务院发表十月十六日杜勒斯预制的同英国一家广播公司所派记者的谈话，杜勒斯从台湾一起飞，谈话就发出来。他说，他看见了一个共产党人的中国，并且说，这个国家确实存在，愿意同它打交道，云云。谢天谢地，我们这个国家，算是被一位美国老爷看见了。这是一个大中国。美国人迫于形势，改变了政策，把你们当作一个“事实上存在的政治单位”，其实并非当作一个国家。这种“事实上存在的政治单位”，在目前开始的第一个阶段，美国人还是需要的。这就是孤立台湾。第二个阶段，就要托管台湾了。国民党朋友们，难道你们还不感觉这种危险吗？出路何在？请你们想一想吧。此次蒋杜会谈文告不过是个公报，没有法律效力，要摆脱是容易的，就看你们有无决心。世界上只有一个中国，没有两个中国。这一点我们是一致的。美国人强迫制造两个中国的伎俩，全中国人民，包括你们和海外侨胞在内，是绝对不容许其实现的。现在这个时代，是一个充满希望的时代，一切爱国者都有出路，不要怕什么帝国主义者。当然，我们并不劝你们马上同美国人决裂，这样想，是不现实的。我们只是希望你们不要屈服于美国人的压力，随人俯仰，丧失主权，最后走到存身无地，被人丢到大海里去。我们这些话是好心，非恶意，将来你们会慢慢理解的。
                    国防部长　彭德怀
                      一九五八年十月二十五日
