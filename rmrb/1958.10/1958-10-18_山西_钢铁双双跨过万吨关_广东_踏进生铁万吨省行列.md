Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. Shanxi Province’s high-yield steel production week has fired its first shot. On the first day of the high-yield week – the 15th – the province produced 11,275.5 tons of steel, more than three times the average daily output of the second week of this month (8th – 14th), exceeding the planned daily production target for the high-yield week by 79.8%. Taiyuan, Lingchuan, Gaoping, Yangcheng, and Jincheng cities and counties all broke through the 1,000-ton mark. On this day, the province produced 13,021 tons of iron, exceeding the planned daily production target for the high-yield week by 76%.

On the 15th, small indigenous furnaces competed with large modern furnaces, and small units competed with large units throughout the province. After several days of hard work, more than two million new steel fighters throughout the province rushed to build a large number of indigenous steelmaking furnaces. The 4,703 indigenous steelmaking furnaces built in Changzhi Prefecture in the previous two days all produced molten steel on the 15th, and the steel output far exceeded that of Taiyuan City, leading all prefectures in the province. Lingchuan County, which had a relatively low steel output, originally planned to surpass Jincheng and Gaoping counties, which had higher steel outputs, in October. However, after four days and nights of hard work, it produced 1,516 tons of steel on the 15th, becoming the county with the highest steel output in the province. The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Heavy Machinery Factory, and other seven machinery factories, which are not primarily engaged in steel production, jointly competed with the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company on this day. As a result, the steel produced by the machinery factories' small furnaces and indigenous furnaces accounted for more than 55% of the city's steel output, exceeding that of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. Guangdong Province's pig iron production surpassed the 10,000-ton mark on the 15th. The province produced a total of 12,072.43 tons of pig iron on this day, plus another 5,490 tons of sintered iron and sponge iron.

After criticizing the ideology of "emphasizing foreign and large-scale," Guangdong Province rapidly built a large number of small and indigenous iron smelting furnaces in various places. Steel armies have been universally established throughout the province. The labor force投入 into the iron smelting front on the 15th has surged from more than two million at the beginning of October to more than four million. In order to strengthen organizational leadership, the secretaries and committee members of the local CPC committees have been going to the iron smelting furnaces in recent days to lead the masses in carrying out large-scale debates, helping to solve specific problems, and continuously improving labor efficiency.

Currently, all parts of the province are concentrating their efforts on striving for new high pig iron production records during the week of the 16th to 22nd. Various places have dispatched large forces to the deep mountains and forests to mine, extract coal, and burn charcoal to prepare "supplies" for the iron smelting furnaces.

    山西　钢铁双双跨过万吨关
    广东　踏进生铁万吨省行列
    新华社太原17日电　山西省钢铁丰产周打响了第一炮。高产周的第一天——15日，全省产钢一万一千二百七十五点五吨，比本月第二周（8日——14日）的平均日产量增长三倍以上，超过高产周的计划日产指标79.8％。太原、陵川、高平、阳城、晋城五个市县，都突破了千吨大关。这一天全省产铁一万三千零二十一吨，超过高产周的计划日产指标76％。
    15日，全省小土炉和大洋炉、小单位和大单位展开了竞赛。全省二百多万钢铁新战士经过几天苦战，抢建了大批土炼钢炉。长治专区前两天建设的四千七百零三座土炼钢炉，15日都流出了钢水，钢产量远远超过了太原市，在全省专区中领先。产钢较少的陵川县，原来计划在10月份超过产钢多的晋城和高平等县，但是经过四昼夜苦战，15日就产钢一千五百一十六吨，成为全省产钢最多的县。并不是以产钢为主的太原矿山机械厂、重型机器厂等七个机器厂，在这一天联合同太原钢铁公司竞赛，结果机器厂的小炉子和土炉子炼出的钢占全市钢产量55％以上，超过了太原钢铁公司。
    新华社广州16日电　广东省生铁产量15日跃过了万吨关。全省这一天共产生铁一万二千零七十二点四三吨，另外还有五千四百九十多吨烧结铁和海绵铁。
    广东省在批判了“重洋贪大”的思想后，各地迅速建起了大批又小又土的炼铁炉。全省普遍建立了钢铁师，15日投入炼铁战线的劳动力，已从10月初的两百多万人激增到四百多万人。为了加强组织领导，各地中共党委书记和党委委员，这几天来都分头深入到炼铁炉旁，领导群众开展炉边大鸣大放大辩论，帮助解决具体问题，使劳动效率不断提高。
    现在，全省各地正在集中力量要在16日至22日这一周，争取新的生铁高产纪录。各地已出动千军万马开赴深山野林，开矿、采煤、烧炭，给炼铁炉准备“粮草”。
