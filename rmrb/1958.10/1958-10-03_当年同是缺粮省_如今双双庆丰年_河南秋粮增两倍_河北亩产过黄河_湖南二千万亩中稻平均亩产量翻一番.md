    Zhengzhou, October 2nd (by this newspaper) – According to preliminary statistics from the Henan Statistics Bureau: The total output of autumn grain in Henan Province this year can reach over 50 billion jin, more than double that of last year. Including the summer grain output, which increased by 1.5 times, the 48 million people in the province can have an average of about 1,500 jin of grain per person. Henan Province, which has historically had very low agricultural output, has transformed into a grain-rich "Land of Abundance."
    According to preliminary statistics and estimations, the average mixed yield of early autumn grain crops per mu reaches 922 jin, with a total output of over 12.1 billion jin, more than double the total output of early autumn grain crops last year. Including the estimated output of 5.6 million mu of spring sweet potatoes, the total output of nearly 20 million mu of early autumn grains and sweet potato crops can reach over 28.9 billion jin, exceeding last year's total output of grains and sweet potatoes of 24.6 billion jin. Among them, 5.6 million mu of spring sweet potatoes are estimated to yield at least 12,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, equivalent to 3,000 jin of grain; 3.98 million mu of early rice yielded an actual average of 1,392 jin per mu. The average yield per mu of spring-sown corn, sorghum, and millet has increased by more than two to five times compared to last year. The estimated average yield per unit area of the entire autumn grain crop can reach over 500 jin, with a total output of over 50 billion jin.
    Along with the great development of grain crop production, the production of cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, and flue-cured tobacco in the province will also achieve rapid development this year. The province's over 12 million mu of cotton fields are expected to have an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, with a total output of over 1 billion jin, an increase of two times compared to last year. Among oilseed crops, peanut yields can reach 500 jin per mu, an increase of 3.7 times compared to last year; sesame yields 100 jin per mu, an increase of two times compared to last year; the total output can reach 480 million jin. The total output of flue-cured tobacco in the province is expected to be nearly 1 billion jin, an increase of more than seven times compared to last year.
    The characteristics of the comprehensive bumper harvest of autumn crops in the province this year are: high yields, large areas, and the emergence of "marshals" and "satellites" in large numbers. According to the regulations of the Henan Provincial People's Committee: counties with an average yield per mu of over 800 jin of rice in new rice areas, an average yield per mu of over 1,000 jin of rice in old rice areas, an average yield per mu of over 800 jin of corn, an average yield per mu of over 600 jin of millet, and an average yield per mu of over 500 jin of sorghum will be awarded the glorious title of "Marshal County." According to statistics, there are currently 59 rice marshal counties and cities, 92 corn marshal counties (cities), 38 millet marshal counties (cities), and 38 sorghum marshal counties (cities) in the province. In Changge County, famous throughout the country for its deep plowing, the average yield per mu of over 100,000 mu of corn reached 3,303 jin. High-yield "satellites" of various crops have also emerged in various places.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 2nd – The peasants of Hebei Province have overcome various difficulties and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. It is estimated that the total grain output of the province can reach 45 billion jin (including 1.355 billion jin of soybeans), an increase of 128.3% compared to last year's total output; the average yield per mu reaches 537.08 jin, exceeding the Yellow River. The total cotton output can reach 1.6 billion jin, an increase of 156.8% compared to last year. The total peanut output can reach 1.2 billion jin, an increase of 143.9% compared to last year. Whether it is mountainous, plain, or low-lying areas, all have achieved bumper harvests. Even in the high-altitude and cold Chengde area, the average yield per mu reached 451.4 jin, stepping onto the banks of the Yellow River in one step. Various crops have "marshals" being promoted and "satellites" going to the sky.
    Hebei Province is a province that has historically lacked grain. After this year's bumper harvest, Hebei Province has basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain, which is of great significance for accelerating national construction. At the same time, Hebei Province occupies an extremely important position in cotton production in the country. The unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton and peanuts in Hebei Province will also play a huge role in supporting industrial construction.
    The achievement of this great harvest is a great victory for the Party's General Line. In the production struggle of the past year, all parts of Hebei resolutely implemented the Party's General Line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, relying on the masses, boldly creating, and actively adopting advanced technologies. At the same time, they carried out sharp struggles against superstition, conservatism, the "wait and see" attitude, and those who settle accounts after the autumn harvest. In the struggle, all localities used the method of big blooming, big contending, and big debating to overcome backward ideas and greatly advance production.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the masses in various places were full of enthusiasm. The bold slogans they put forward were: "Demand grain from nature, declare war on the earth," "Hard land is not harder than our determination, high mountains are not higher than our footsteps." Their actual actions were: eating and sleeping in the fields, fighting day and night. Especially in water conservancy construction and the fight against drought, the people of the province established the communist style of "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me," universally breaking down the boundaries between townships and counties, and carrying out communist collaboration. According to statistics, the number of people who have been supporting other areas for a long time alone has reached more than 1.3 million.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 2nd – Following the bumper harvest of early rice, Hunan Province has achieved an even greater bumper harvest of over 20 million mu of intermediate rice. According to preliminary statistics on the 29th, over 20.049 million mu of intermediate rice in the province yielded a total of 16.514494 billion jin of dried grain, with an average yield of 806 jin per mu, an increase of more than double the 388 jin per mu of intermediate rice last year. At present, the province has already obtained more than 29.8 billion jin of early and intermediate rice, which is more than 7.4 billion jin more than the total grain output of 22.4 billion jin for the entire year last year.
    The characteristics of this year's bumper harvest of intermediate rice in the province are large-scale, high-speed, and balanced yield increases. Among the 95 counties and cities in the province, 32 counties and cities have become intermediate rice thousand-jin counties. Thousand-jin townships, five thousand-jin communes, and ten thousand-jin mu are everywhere. Yueyang County alone has 105 mu of intermediate rice with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu. Whether it is in the plains, hilly areas, or mountainous areas, all are leaping forward at a speed of doubling to tripling the yield of intermediate rice. This year, the three thousand-jin intermediate rice areas that have emerged in the province are the Changde area, which is distributed in the Dongting Lake Plain, the Hengyang area in the hilly area, and the Qianyang area, which is located in the high-altitude and cold mountains of western Hunan.
    This year's bumper harvest of intermediate rice in Hunan Province was achieved through the struggle against continuous rain, drought, and insect pests. The main reasons for the bumper harvest are that politics are in command, relying on the masses, resolutely carrying out the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, mobilizing the masses to truly shoulder the burden of thousand-jin yields; that after the nationwide rectification movement and repeated struggles against right-leaning conservative thinking, the thinking of the vast number of cadres and masses was liberated; and that cadres were transferred layer by layer to go deep into the fields to plant experimental fields, etc.
    Now, inspired by the bumper harvest of early and intermediate rice and in the high tide of the communization movement, the peasants of Hunan are advancing victoriously, strengthening the field management of over 14 million mu of late rice, and striving for an even greater bumper harvest of late rice.

    当年同是缺粮省　如今双双庆丰年
    河南秋粮增两倍　河北亩产过黄河
    湖南二千万亩中稻平均亩产量翻一番
    本报郑州2日电　据河南统计局初步统计：河南全省今年秋收粮食总产量可达五百亿斤以上，要比去年增加二倍多，连同增产一点五倍的夏收粮食总产量在内，全省四千八百万人，每人平均可有粮一千五百斤左右，历来农业产量很低的河南省，一变而为粮食丰饶的“天府之国”。
    据初步统计和估算：全省早秋粮食作物的混合产量，每亩平均达九百二十二斤，总产量可达一百二十一亿斤以上，比去年的早秋粮食作物总产量增产二倍多。加上五百六十万亩春红薯的预计产量在内，全省近二千万亩的早秋粮食和薯类作物的总产量，就可达到二百八十九亿斤以上，超过去年全年粮食和薯类总产量二百四十六亿斤的总和，其中五百六十万亩春红薯，估计每亩至少可收红薯一万二千斤，折粮食三千斤；三百九十八万多亩早稻，平均每亩实收一千三百九十二斤。春播的玉米、高粱、谷子等平均单产都比去年增长二倍以上到五倍。整个秋季粮食作物预计平均单位面积产量可达五百斤以上，总产可达五百亿斤以上。
    伴随着粮食作物生产的大发展，今年全省的棉花、油料、烤烟等经济作物生产也将获得飞跃的发展。全省一千二百多万亩棉田预计平均单产可达皮棉一百斤，总产量可达十亿斤以上，比去年增产二倍。油料作物中的花生单产可达五百斤，比去年增产三点七倍；芝麻亩产一百斤，比去年增产二倍；总产量可达四点八亿斤。全省烤烟总产量预计近十亿斤，比去年增产七倍多。
    全省今年秋季作物全面大丰收的特点是：产量高，面积大，“元帅”和“卫星”层出不穷。根据河南省人民委员会规定：凡水稻在新稻区平均亩产八百斤以上、老稻区平均亩产千斤以上、玉米亩产八百斤以上、谷子平均亩产六百斤以上、高粱亩产五百斤以上的县，都获得“元帅县”的光荣称号。据统计：目前全省已出现五十九个水稻元帅县、市，玉米元帅县（市）九十二个，谷子元帅县（市）三十八个，高粱元帅县（市）三十八个。以深翻土地闻名全国的长葛县，全县十万多亩玉米，平均亩产达三千三百零三斤。各地还出现了许多各种作物的高产“卫星”。
    据新华社天津2日电　河北省农民战胜各种困难，获得了空前未有的大丰收。据预计，全省粮食总产量可达四百五十亿斤（包括大豆十三亿五千五百万斤），比去年总产量将增长128.3％；平均亩产达五百三十七点零八斤，越过了黄河。棉花总产量可达到十六亿斤，比去年增长156.8％。花生总产量可达到十二亿斤，比去年增长143.9％。不论山区、平原或是低洼地区，都获得丰收，就连高寒的承德专区，平均亩产也达到四百五十一点四斤，一步踏到黄河边。各种作物都有“元帅”升帐和“卫星”上天。
    河北省是历年缺粮的省份，今年丰收后，河北省就基本上达到了粮食自给，这对加速国家的建设有着极为重大的意义。同时，河北省棉花在全国占着极为重要的地位，河北省棉花和花生的空前大丰收，对支援工业建设也将起到巨大的作用。
    这个大丰收的取得，是党的总路线的巨大胜利。在一年来的生产斗争中，河北各地坚决贯彻了党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，依靠群众，大胆创造，积极采取先进技术，同时向迷信、保守、观潮派，秋后算账派进行了尖锐的斗争。在斗争中，各地运用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，战胜了落后思想，使生产大大地前进一步。
    各地群众在党的领导下，干劲冲天，他们提出的豪迈口号是：“向自然要粮，向地球开战”、“地硬硬不过我们的决心，山高高不过我们的脚心”。他们的实际行动是：食宿在田间，昼夜奋战。特别是在水利建设和抗旱斗争中，全省人民树立了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义风格，普遍打破乡界县界，进行共产主义大协作。据统计，仅长期在外支援的人数，即达一百三十余万人。
    据新华社长沙2日电　继早稻丰收后，湖南省两千多万亩中稻又获得更大的丰收。据29日初步统计，全省二千零四十九万多亩中稻，共收干谷一百六十五亿一千四百九十四万多斤，平均亩产八百零六斤，较去年中稻亩产三百八十八斤增产一倍多。目前，全省已拿到手的早、中稻谷即达二百九十八亿多斤，比去年全年粮食总产量二百二十四亿多斤还多七十四亿多斤。
    今年全省中稻丰收的特点是，大面积的、高速度的平衡增产。全省九十五个县、市中，已有三十二个县、市成为中稻千斤县。千斤乡、五千斤社和万斤亩，到处皆是。单是岳阳县中稻亩产万斤以上的就有一百零五亩。无论是平原、丘陵区和山区，都以中稻翻一番到两番的速度跃进。今年全省已出现的三个中稻千斤专区，有分布在洞庭湖滨平原的常德专区，丘陵地带的衡阳专区和地处湘西高寒山地的黔阳专区。
    湖南省今年中稻丰收是同霪雨、干旱、虫害灾害作斗争才夺来的。丰收的主要原因，在于政治挂帅，依靠群众，坚决地开展农村两条道路的斗争，发动群众真正担起千斤丰产的担子；在于经过全民整风运动和反复向右倾保守思想作斗争，广大干部、群众思想获得了解放；在于干部层层下放，深入田间，种试验田等。
    现在，湖南农民在早、中稻丰收的鼓舞下，在公社化运动的高潮中，又乘胜前进，加强一千四百多万亩晚稻的田间管理，要争取晚稻更大的丰收。
