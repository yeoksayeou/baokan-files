    Students Surpass Teachers
    Mu Ye
    Many university students, in the work of teaching reform, have held high the red flag, boldly broken superstitions, liberated their minds, and with a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, bravely taken on the task of formulating teaching syllabi and writing textbooks. This is an unprecedented initiative and a magnificent feat.
    Formulating teaching syllabi has always been the prerogative of "experts," and young people who have not yet left school have never had a part in it. Therefore, it has also been met with endless contempt and criticism from some people hanging the "professor" and "expert" signs. Let's cite two facts from the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University:
    First, the students in the classical literature group initially heard such a mocking voice: "You can't write a syllabus in a vacuum! You don't have enough material." An old teacher even contemptuously questioned the students: "Do you know the Four Divine Things? Do you know the Four Great Legends?" Then came a long stream of tedious textual research and showing off, attempting to strike the students down with a "deterrent blow." Second, some students in the foreign literature group, in order to understand the situation of progressive Indonesian literature, enthusiastically went to Peking University to consult a certain professor, but were met with a series of impolite questions: "Do you understand Indonesian? How many foreign languages do you know?" When the students repeatedly asked him for advice, he said: "Indonesian literature is very complex. We won't be able to offer this course until 1962..." A bucket of cold water was poured over these students.
    Now, let's see what the results are. First of all, as the students in the classical literature group said, the "material hurdle" did not stump them. Encouraged and led by the Party member students in the group, they worked twenty-odd hours a day, not sleeping for three consecutive nights, and mastered all the necessary materials in three or four days. One subgroup alone (a total of twenty-odd people) read nearly three hundred books in this time. They said: "Marxist-Leninist viewpoints married the materials and rapidly nurtured a newborn infant." After seven days and nights of hard work, they finally produced a draft syllabus with completely new content, and its quality far exceeded another syllabus drafted by the teachers during the same period. The foreign literature group ran all over all the libraries and related units they could reach, searching all the materials they could find (including Indonesian literature), and in a short time sorted out more than 10,000 cards. Finally, they drafted the first foreign literature syllabus in the country that focuses on proletarian socialist literature and progressive oriental literature. Now they have already started writing part of the lectures based on this completely new system syllabus. This is the result, and it is also the young people's answer to those who are just hanging the "professor" and "expert" signs. Obviously, this answer is powerful and ruthless. In the face of this fact, all the ridicule and criticism of the bourgeois professors and experts have completely failed.
    Today, our era is an era in which students surpass teachers, an era in which the communist style blossoms everywhere. Anyone who does not see the wisdom of the masses under the leadership of the Party, looks down on the new forces, and dares not or is unwilling to jump out of all idealism, metaphysics, and outdated frameworks that cling to the old and preserve the worn-out, can only create a tragedy that is not to be pitied for themselves.

    学生胜过老师

    许多高等学校的同学，在教学改革的工作中高举红旗，大胆破除迷信、解放思想，以敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，勇敢地承担起了拟定教学大纲编写教材的任务。这是一件前所未有的创举与壮举。
    从来拟制教学大纲是只有“专家”才有资格去作的，根本不曾有过未出校门的青年人的份儿。因此，它也遭到了一些挂着“教授”、“专家”的招牌的人的层出不穷的白眼与非难。下面不妨举出北京师大中文系的两件事实：
    第一件，古典文学小组的同学在一开始就听到这样一种讥讽的声音：“写大纲不能架空呀！你们掌握的材料太少了。”有个老教师更轻蔑地向同学考问道：“你知道四大神物吗？你知道四大传奇是什么吗？”接着，便是一大通繁琐考证的卖弄，企图将同学们一“杀威棒”打下去。第二件，外国文学组有几位同学，为了了解印度尼西亚进步文学的情况，曾满怀热情地到北大去请教某教授，得到的回答却是一连串的不客气的反问：“你们懂得印尼文吗？你们会几国外国语啊？”当同学们一再向他求教时，他又说道：“印尼文学很复杂，我们要到1962年才能开这门课……”，一盆冷水把这几位同学泼回去了。
    现在，让我们来看看事情的结果是怎么样吧。首先，正如古典文学组同学所说的，“材料关”并没有难倒他们，在组内党员同学的鼓舞和带动下，他们一天工作二十几个小时，一连三夜不睡觉，在三、四天内就掌握了全部必要的材料，其中仅一个分组（共二十余人），在这个时间里，就看了近三百册书。他们说：“马列主义观点和材料结了婚，迅速地哺育出新生的婴儿。”经过七昼夜的苦战，终于作出了内容崭新的教学大纲初稿，而且质量远远地超过了教师们在同时期拟定的另一份大纲。外国文学组的人，跑遍了一切能跑到的图书馆与有关单位，找遍了一切能够找到的资料（包括印尼文学的），在短时间内整理出一万多张卡片，最后，也终于拟定出了目前全国仅有的第一份以无产阶级社会主义文学与东方进步文学为主体的外国文学教学大纲，现在他们已经按照这完全是新的体系的大纲，编写出一部分讲义来了。这就是事情的结果，也是青年人们对那些空挂着“教授”、“专家”招牌的人的回答。显然，这个回答是有力的，同时也是无情的。在这个事实面前，资产阶级教授、专家们的一切嘲笑与非难，都全部落空。
    今天，我们的时代是学生胜过老师的时代，是共产主义风格遍地开花的时代。任何看不见党领导下的群众的智慧、看不起新生力量，不敢或不愿跳出一切唯心主义、形而上学与抱残守缺的陈旧框框的人，只能给自己制造着不被同情的悲剧。
