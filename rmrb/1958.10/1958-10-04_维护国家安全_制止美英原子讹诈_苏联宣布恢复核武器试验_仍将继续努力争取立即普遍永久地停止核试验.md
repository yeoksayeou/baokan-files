Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 3rd. TASS Moscow, October 2nd: According to a decision by the Soviet government, the Soviet Union has now resumed nuclear weapons testing; TASS is authorized to issue the following statement.

As everyone knows, throughout the entire post-war period, the Soviet Union has consistently waged a tenacious struggle to achieve a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons and, as a first step in this regard, to achieve an immediate and universal cessation of testing such weapons. The Soviet Union's struggle has thus far been unsuccessful due to obstruction by the U.S. and British governments, which have continuously created obstacles to reaching an agreement on this issue.

In order to make a practical start on the immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing, thereby taking a first step in completely freeing humanity from the threat of a devastating atomic war, the Soviet Union, on March 31 of this year, adopted a decision to cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons in the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Soviet government then declared in advance that if other countries possessing such weapons continued to conduct tests, the Soviet government, considering the interests of Soviet security, would be free to act on the issue of conducting nuclear weapons tests in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government took the above decision in the original hope that the U.S. and British governments, which possess nuclear weapons, could emulate the Soviet Union's lofty example. The Soviet Union's cessation of testing received warm support and endorsement from broad world public opinion, which had long called for a cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

Regrettably, the Soviet Union's hopes were dashed. The facts of recent times show that the U.S. and Britain have not only failed to adopt the Soviet Union's honest and clear proposal to universally cease all tests of nuclear weapons and conclude a corresponding agreement for this purpose, but, on the contrary, they have disregarded the will of the people of all countries and have used the Soviet Union's actions to obtain a unilateral maximum military advantage. The proof is that, precisely after March 31 of this year, after the Soviet Union ceased nuclear testing and called on other countries to emulate its example, the U.S. and British governments conducted a series of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests of unprecedented scale in recent years. The U.S. alone conducted about forty nuclear weapons explosions during this period.

The Soviet Union originally expected that the decision of the Geneva conference of experts on the possibility of supervising violations of the ban on testing atomic and hydrogen weapons could prompt the U.S. and British governments to also cease testing nuclear weapons and conclude a corresponding agreement with the Soviet Union. However, after the Geneva conference, the U.S. and Britain not only did not cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, but also formally declared that they would continue to conduct such tests. The U.S. announced at the end of August that, after completing a series of nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific, it would conduct a series of tests on U.S. soil, which are currently being conducted in Nevada. These actions by the U.S. and British governments show that they are verbally declaring their willingness to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, but in actual fact they are stepping up the arms race in an attempt to gain a military advantage in order to realize their policy of military threat.

Considering these circumstances, the Soviet government cannot allow the security interests of the Soviet state to be harmed by the actions of the U.S. and Britain. Therefore, the Soviet government declared on August 30 of this year that the actions of the U.S. and Britain released the Soviet Union from the obligations it had unilaterally undertaken in the hope that Western governments would show sincerity on the issue of the immediate and universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

TASS is also authorized to declare that, due to the actions of the U.S. and Britain, the Soviet Union has been forced to resume nuclear weapons testing, but at the same time, the Soviet Union will continue to wage a consistent struggle to achieve the immediate, universal, and permanent cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. If this goal can be achieved, it would be a major contribution to the cause of maintaining peace and ensuring universal security.

    维护国家安全　制止美英原子讹诈
    苏联宣布恢复核武器试验
    仍将继续努力争取立即普遍永久地停止核试验
    新华社3日讯　塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：根据苏联政府的决定，苏联现在已经恢复核武器试验；为此，塔斯社受权发表声明如下。
    大家知道，在整个战后时期，苏联一直始终不渝地进行着顽强的斗争，争取完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，作为这方面的第一步——争取立即普遍停止试验这类武器。苏联的这一斗争由于美国和英国政府的阻挠迄今没有得到成功，因为美国和英国政府在就这一问题达成协定方面不断制造障碍。
    苏联为了给立即普遍停止试验核武器打开一个实际开端，从而在使人类彻底免除毁灭性的原子战争的威胁方面迈出第一步，于今年3月31日通过在苏联停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的决定。同时，苏联政府当时就预先声明：如果拥有这类武器的其他国家继续进行试验，苏联政府考虑到苏联安全的利益，在苏联进行核武器试验问题上将自由行动。
    苏联政府采取上述决定，原希望拥有核武器的美国和英国政府能效法苏联的崇高榜样。苏联的停止试验获得了广大世界公众的热烈支持和护拥，世界公众早就呼吁停止试验核武器。
    遗憾的是，苏联的希望落空了。最近时期的事实说明，美国和英国不仅没有采纳苏联的正直而明确的建议，来普遍停止核武器的一切试验及为此缔结相应的协定，而是相反，它们无视各国人民的意志，竟利用苏联的这种作法来取得单方面的最大限度的军事优势。其证明就是，恰恰是在今年3月31日以后，在苏联停止核试验并呼吁其他国家效法它的榜样以后，美国和英国政府却进行了历年来规模空前巨大的一系列原子武器和氢武器试验。仅仅美国在这一时期内就进行了四十次左右的核武器爆炸。
    苏联原指望，日内瓦专家会议关于有可能对破坏禁止试验原子武器和氢武器的禁令实行监督的决定能够推动美国和英国政府也停止试验核武器，并同苏联缔结相应的协定。但是，日内瓦会议以后，美国和英国不仅没有停止试验原子武器和氢武器，而且正式声明它们将继续进行这种试验。美国在8月底曾宣布，它在结束在太平洋进行的一系列核武器试验后，还要在美国本土上进行一系列的试验，目前这种试验正在内华达州进行。美国和英国政府的这些行动表明，它们在口头上声明愿意停止试验原子武器和氢武器，而在实际行动上却加紧军备竞赛，企图获得军事优势来实现它们所推行的军事威胁政策。
    考虑到这些情况，苏联政府不能容许，由于美国和英国的这种行动而使苏维埃国家的安全利益遭到损失。因此，苏联政府在今年8月30日就声明，美国和英国的行动解除了苏联为了希望西方国家政府在立即普遍停止试验核武器问题上表现诚意而单方面承担的义务。
    塔斯社还受权声明，苏联由于美国和英国的行动而不得不恢复核武器试验，但同时苏联今后仍将继续进行一贯的斗争，争取立即普遍地、永久地停止试验原子武器和氢武器。若能达到这一目的，那将是对维护和平和保证普遍安全事业的一大贡献。
