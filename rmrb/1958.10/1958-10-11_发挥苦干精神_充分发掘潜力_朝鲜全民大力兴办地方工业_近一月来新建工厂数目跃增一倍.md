Xinhua News Agency Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, since the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee issued a call in June for the entire population to develop industry, the people in various parts of northern Korea have actively responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, shattered the idea of "mystifying" industrial development, and vigorously developed local industries.

In the past month, the number of factories built in various parts of North Korea has doubled, reaching more than 960. On average, each city and county has 5.5 factories.

These factories, built after the June Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party, were constructed by fully exploiting potential, utilizing existing equipment, and minimizing state investment. The workers in the factories are mostly family members of staff and workers. The more than 100 hand looms and 35 various knitting machines of the newly built Jiangxi Textile Factory were collected from various villages in the county.

In response to the call of the Labor Party and the government, the people of North Korea have displayed a high degree of initiative and creativity. The farmers of the Zhongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Dusan Village, Ningyuan County, Pingan South Road, with the help of workers from the province's electric power company, built a small hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 15 kilowatts. The generator used by the power station was rushed out by the workers of the electric power company after four days and nights of hard work. In addition to supplying lighting for 100 households in the area, the power station can also be used by farmers for rice husking, grain threshing, and water pumping for irrigation.

The electric power company in the province is about to complete a small thermal power station with a power generation capacity of 10 kilowatts, using corn stalks as fuel, and only needs 150 catties of fuel per day. This thermal power station can also refine by-products such as tar, industrial oil, and high-grade coatings in the future. The electric power company plans to help farmers build 37 small hydroelectric power stations next year.

At present, North Korea's local industry has entered a new stage. According to preliminary statistics: the total output value of all local industries (including existing ones) and handicraft production cooperatives will reach more than 100 billion yuan (North Korean currency) next year. They can produce 1.2 million tons of cement, more than 50,000 tons of pig iron, 510,000 tons of lime, more than 44 million meters of textiles, 75,000 ox carts, more than 6,400 tons of paper, more than 140 million tiles, as well as other daily necessities and food, which will play a huge role in local construction, the development of the rural economy, and the improvement of people's lives.

As early as the end of August, 445 factories had been built in various parts of North Korea, with an average of three to four factories built in each city and county. After these factories were put into production, they produced a large number of foods, textiles, building materials, agricultural tools, ceramics, and paper that the people needed.

When building factories, cadres and the masses in various places worked together and displayed the spirit of hard work. A small cement plant built in Shunchuan County, Pingan South Road, had its small cement kiln built by Zheng Jingxi, chairman of the Shunchuan County Committee of the Labor Party, along with workers after four days and nights of hard work. This kiln has already produced 15 tons of cement. The factory will also build 20 small cement kilns next year, with an annual output of 100,000 tons of cement. A small hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 2.5 kilowatts, recently built by the First Agricultural Cooperative in Yunzhong Village, Yunshi County, Ciangdao, has provided electricity for the remote mountain village, and electricity is used for irrigation.

### 发挥苦干精神  充分发掘潜力  朝鲜全民大力兴办地方工业  近一月来新建工厂数目跃增一倍

    发挥苦干精神  充分发掘潜力
    朝鲜全民大力兴办地方工业
    近一月来新建工厂数目跃增一倍
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：自从朝鲜劳动党中央六月全会发出关于全民办工业的号召以来，朝鲜北部各地人民都积极地响应党中央的号召，打破了办工业“神秘化”的思想，大力兴办地方工业。
    最近一个月来朝鲜各地兴建起来的工厂跃增一倍，达到九百六十多个。平均每个市、郡有五点五个工厂。
    这些在朝鲜劳动党六月全会以后兴办起来的工厂，都是采取充分发掘潜力、利用旧有设备和尽量减少国家投资的方法建成的。工厂的工人绝大部分是职工家属。新建起来的江西纺织厂的一百多台手工织布机和三十五台各种针织机都是从郡内各里收集起来的。
    为了响应劳动党和政府的号召，朝鲜各地人民发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。平安南道宁远郡都三里中兴农业社的农民，在这个道的电业公司工人的帮助下，建成了一座发电能力为十五瓩的小型水力发电站。发电站所用的发电机是电业公司的工人们经过四昼夜的苦战赶制成的。这个发电站除供应当地一百户人家的照明外，还可供农民们捣米、脱谷和抽水浇田等之用。
    这个道的电业公司即将建成的发电能力为十瓩的小型火电站，用玉蜀黍秸作燃料，一天只需一百五十斤燃料就够了。这个火电站将来还能炼出焦油、工业用油和高级涂料等副产品。这个电业公司计划在明年帮助农民建设三十七所小型水力发电站。
    目前，朝鲜北部地方工业已进入了新的阶段。据初步统计：所有地方工业（包括已有的）和各手工业生产合作社明年的生产总值将达到一千多亿元（朝币）。它们可以生产一百二十万吨水泥，五万多吨生铁，五十一万吨石灰，四千四百多万公尺纺织品，七万五千辆牛车，六千四百多吨纸张，一亿四千多万块瓦，以及其它日用品和食品，这将对地方建设和发展农村经济以及提高人民生活起巨大作用。
    早在8月底，朝鲜各地就已经兴办了四百四十五个工厂，平均每个市、郡都兴建了三个到四个。这些工厂在投入生产后，生产了大批人民需要的食品、纺织品、建筑材料、农具、陶瓷器和纸张等。
    在兴建工厂时，各地干部和群众在一起，发挥了苦干精神。平安南道顺川郡建成的一座小水泥厂，这个厂的小水泥窑是在劳动党顺川郡委员会委员长郑景锡同工人们一起苦战四昼夜建成的，这座窑已经出产了十五吨水泥。这个厂在明年还将建成二十座小水泥窑，年产十万吨水泥。慈江道云时郡云中里第一农业社最近建成的一座发电能力为二点五瓩的小水力发电站，使这个偏僻的山村有了电灯，并且用电力进行灌溉。
