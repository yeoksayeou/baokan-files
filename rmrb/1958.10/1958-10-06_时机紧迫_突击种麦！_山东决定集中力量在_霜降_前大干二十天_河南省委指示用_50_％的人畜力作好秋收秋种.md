Time is Tight, Rush to Plant Wheat!
    Shandong Decides to Concentrate Efforts on a 20-Day Push Before "Frost's Descent"
    Henan Provincial Party Committee Directs 50% of Manpower and Animal Power to Do a Good Job in Autumn Harvest and Autumn Planting
    (By Our Newspaper) A great and arduous effort for twenty days to ensure that wheat is fully planted and well planted – this is the battle call issued by the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a telephone conference of local municipal party committees on the evening of the 2nd.
    At the meeting, Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a report on the issues of rushing to harvest, rushing to plow, and ensuring the timely completion of wheat planting tasks. He said that according to Shandong's agricultural season requirements, the autumn planting task must be completed before "Frost's Descent" (October 24th) at the latest. At the same time, many crops are already ripe but have not been harvested in time. If this work is not done well, the rich fruits of labor created by a year of hard work will suffer undue losses when they are within reach. Therefore, there is a serious contradiction between the autumn harvest and autumn planting tasks and the time, labor, animal power, and agricultural implements available. If these contradictions cannot be resolved by all possible means, it will inevitably lead to either shallow and rough planting for the sake of speed or a failure to meet the agricultural season, preventing the completion of the autumn planting task in terms of quality and quantity, and thereby adversely affecting the great leap forward in steel production. Shu Tong called on all localities to seriously face this problem and immediately mobilize to work hard for twenty days, or preferably half a month, to ensure the high-quality, high-speed, and high-efficiency victory of completing the task of planting 80 million mu of wheat. To this end, Shu Tong asked all localities to earnestly do the following tasks:
    1.  Properly arrange the current steel production and autumn harvest and autumn planting work. In the current situation where the mass campaign for all the people to make steel has been widely launched and the autumn harvest and autumn planting task has reached the final urgent stage, it is necessary to concentrate the main force before "Frost's Descent" to quickly and intensively rush through the tasks of rushing to harvest, rushing to plow, and rushing to plant to ensure a bumper harvest this year and strive for a greater leap forward next year.
    2.  From leading party and government organs at all levels to the vast numbers of commune members of the people's communes, organize two fronts, open up two battlefields, advance side by side, and adopt a two-pronged approach to ensure the organic combination of steel production and autumn harvest and autumn planting. On the agricultural front, it is necessary to organize different work organizations, implement division of labor and responsibility, and implement assembly line operations to achieve simultaneous harvesting, plowing, transporting fertilizer, and sowing.
    3.  On the current agricultural production front, it is necessary to grasp the key points and take overall consideration. It is necessary to concentrate efforts to plant the 80 million mu of wheat fully and well without missing the opportunity and also to take out the necessary force to do a good job in the autumn harvest – timely harvesting and bringing every grain home.
    4.  Continue to vigorously carry out technological reforms and save a lot of manpower and animal power. He especially praised the method of rope-pulled plows and the large-scale use of simple tracks in the Linyi area.
    5.  Continue to promote large-scale collaboration and support between counties, townships, communes, and teams.
    6.  In order to strengthen the leadership of the current autumn harvest and autumn planting work, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels should, in addition to continuing to vigorously grasp steel production, devote a certain amount of time to grasping autumn planting work and earnestly achieve grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other. (Cao Xuepu)
    (By Our Newspaper) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China urgently instructed party committees at all levels that while vigorously engaging in steel production, they must ensure that wheat is planted well in a timely manner and strive to lay a good foundation for achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of wheat throughout the province next year.
    The instruction said: "Cold Dew" is approaching, and the autumn harvest and wheat planting have reached the most intense time. In order to ensure that while vigorously engaging in steel production, the land is turned over in a timely manner, wheat is planted well, the following urgent instructions are hereby made:
    1.  Party committees at all levels must clearly understand that vigorously engaging in steel production is the primary task of the whole party. However, while vigorously engaging in steel production, it is necessary to grasp the autumn harvest and wheat planting and not relax in the slightest. The central tasks of current agricultural production are: to ensure a good harvest in autumn, turn over the land well, apply sufficient base fertilizer, complete the expansion of the wheat planting area, plant wheat well, and lay the material foundation for the goal of a thousand-jin province for wheat next year. Certain views that oppose agricultural production and steel production and the practice of single-mindedness should be overcome and prevented.
    2.  The first secretaries of party committees at all levels must grasp industry with one hand and agriculture with the other under the premise of vigorously engaging in steel production. A secretary or deputy secretary and an appropriate number of party committee members should be designated to specifically lead agricultural production work. Those who have not yet been designated should be designated, and those who have not yet been fixed should be fixed. According to the different sowing seasons of wheat, each locality should ensure that about 50% of the labor and animal power is invested in the autumn harvest and wheat planting campaign during the most intense two weeks of sowing to rush and plant wheat well.
    3.  Specific problems regarding wheat planting should be solved quickly and locally. A general inspection and airing should be carried out on the wheat seeds, and germination tests should be conducted. If the amount of seeds is insufficient, the people's communes should be mobilized to solve it locally to ensure that 30 jin are sown per mu. Regarding the issue of expanding the wheat planting area, the area of sweet potatoes and late autumn crops should be reduced in a planned manner, and some early cotton can also be changed to cotton-wheat intercropping appropriately. Soil treatment for the prevention and control of underground insects should be stepped up to ensure full emergence of seedlings. Livestock work should be strengthened in feeding management, attention should be paid to rational use, and full fattening should be ensured.
    4.  The Provincial Party Committee has decided to organize forces to conduct inspections and summarize and exchange experiences in a timely manner. It also plans to organize cadres from provincial-level agencies to help farmers turn over the land. All localities, cities, county party committees, agencies, schools, and troops can organize a deep plowing army to support the turning of the land and wheat planting and strive for a thousand-jin province for wheat next year.

    时机紧迫  突击种麦！
    山东决定集中力量在“霜降”前大干二十天
    河南省委指示用50％的人畜力作好秋收秋种
    本报讯　大干苦干二十天，保证把小麦种足种好，这是中共山东省委在2日晚召开的各地市委电话会议上提出的战斗号召。
    会上，省委第一书记舒同就抢收、抢耕，保证适时完成种麦任务问题作了报告。他说，根据山东农时季节要求，秋种任务最迟要在“霜降”（10月24日）以前全部完成。同时，目前许多作物已经成熟了，还没有及时收获，这一工作作不好，一年苦战所创造的丰富的劳动成果，就会在到手的时候遭受不应有的损失。因此，秋收秋种任务与时间、劳力、畜力、农具之间发生了严重的不相适应的矛盾。这些矛盾如果不能想尽一切办法加以解决，必将发生不是为了图快就浅耕粗种，就是违误农时，不能按质按量地完成秋种任务，并且由此对钢铁生产大跃进发生不利的影响。舒同号召各地应当严重地正视这个问题，要立即动员起来，大干苦干二十天，最好争取半个月，确保秋种八千万亩小麦的任务保质保量、又快又好的胜利完成。为此，舒同要求各地认真作好以下几项工作：
    一、要妥善安排当前的钢铁生产和秋收秋种工作。在全党全民大炼钢铁的运动已广泛发动起来的情况下，在秋收秋种任务已到刻不容缓的最后紧张阶段的情况下，有必要在“霜降”以前集中主要力量，迅速突击一下抢收、抢耕、抢种工作，以保证今年丰产丰收和争取明年更大的跃进。
    二、从各级党政领导机关到人民公社的广大社员群众，组织两条战线，开辟两个战场，齐头并进，双管齐下，保证钢铁生产和秋收秋种有机结合进行。在农业战线方面，要组织不同的作业组织，实行分工负责，流水作业，达到边收、边耕、边运肥、边播种。
    三、在当前的农业生产战线上，必须抓住重点，兼顾全面。既要集中力量使八千万亩小麦不失时机的种足种好，又要拿出必要的力量作好秋收——适时收割，颗粒还家。
    四、继续大搞技术改革，大量节约人力、畜力。他特别推崇绳索牵引犁和临沂专区大搞简易轨道的办法。
    五、继续提倡县乡社队之间的大协作大支援。
    六、为了加强当前秋收秋种工作的领导，各级党委第一书记除了继续大抓钢铁生产之外，应抽出一定的时间抓秋种工作，认真作到一手抓工业，一手抓农业。（曹学璞）
    本报讯　中共河南省委紧急指示各级党委在大搞钢铁的同时，要保证适时种好小麦，力争为实现明年全省小麦亩产千斤打下良好基础。
    指示说：“寒露”将至，秋收种麦已到最紧张的时候。为保证在大搞钢铁的同时，适时翻完土地、种好小麦，特作如下紧急指示：
    一、各级党委必须明确大干钢铁是全党的首要任务。但是在大干钢铁生产的同时，必须把秋收种麦抓起来，不能有所放松。当前农业生产中心任务是：保证收好秋，翻好地，施足底肥，完成扩大麦播面积，种好小麦，打下明年小麦千斤省的物质基础。某些把农业生产和钢铁生产对立起来的看法和单打一的作法，应加以克服和防止。
    二、各级党委的第一书记必须在大干钢铁的前提下，一手抓工业，一手抓农业。应确定一位书记或副书记和适当数量的党委委员专门领导农业生产工作。凡是没有确定的应确定下来，没有固定的应固定下来。各地可根据小麦不同的播种季节，在播种最紧张的半个月里，应保证有50％左右的劳、畜力投入秋收种麦运动，突击把小麦种好。
    三、关于种麦的具体问题，应迅速就地解决。对于小麦种子问题，应普遍进行一次检查、翻晒，进行发芽试验。如种子量不够时，应发动人民公社就地解决，保证每亩播种三十斤。对于扩大小麦播种面积问题，主要是有计划地减缩红薯和晚秋作物面积，也可以适当地改一部分早棉为棉麦间作。防治地下虫的土壤处理工作应抓紧进行，以保证全苗。对于牲畜工作应加强饲养管理，注意合理使役，保证满膘。
    四、省委决定除组织力量进行检查，及时总结交流经验外，计划组织省直机关干部帮助农民翻地。各地、市、县委，各级机关、学校、部队都可以组织深翻大军支援翻地种麦，为争取明年小麦千斤省而奋斗。　（阚枫）
