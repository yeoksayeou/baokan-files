Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Mayor Peng Zhen said at the banquet he held tonight to welcome the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China that the people of China and Iraq, the people of Asia and Africa, and the people of the world are all in the same boat, and as long as the people of all countries in the world unite and fight together, imperialism will surely fail.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that there is an old saying in China called "in the same boat". The people of China and Iraq, the people of Asia and Africa, and the people of all countries in the world are all in the same boat. Both China and Iraq have a long history and a long culture. Both countries have suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time. We have successively defeated the enemies who oppressed us and achieved victory. After the victory, the people of the two countries have a common enemy, which is imperialism. After the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution, U.S. imperialism armed invaded Lebanon, threatening the security of the young Republic of Iraq. It is the same imperialist who is still occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan and constantly carrying out military provocations against us. Those who threaten our security are common enemies. We have common interests and no conflicting interests. This fully illustrates that we are in the same boat.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that U.S. imperialists not only made a noose for themselves, but are also tightening this noose. Just that one America is against the people of China, Iraq, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. With just that little power, it is distributed all over the world. From ancient times to the present, no country that has been the enemy of so many countries has not suffered a disastrous defeat in the end. As long as the people of all countries in the world unite and fight together, imperialism will surely fail. Therefore, the unity of the people of China and Iraq, the people of Asian and African countries, and the people of all countries in the world is the most important thing in the world. The visit of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China is a support for the Chinese people, and we also regard it as the most important thing.

Head of the delegation Mahmoud then spoke. He said that the Iraqi people and the Arab people regard the Chinese people as the elder brother in the big family of the Asian and African people, because the Chinese people have always supported the Arab people's national independence movement. In the days after the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution, the Iraqi people received valuable support and assistance from China and other socialist countries, which will always remain in our hearts. The friendship and mutual support between us and China and other socialist countries will last forever.

The head of the delegation said that any victory of the people in the Middle East is a victory for the people in the Far East, and any victory of the people in the Far East is also a victory for the people in the Middle East. Indeed, we are brothers and sisters in the same boat, partners in the common struggle, our enemy is one, and our destiny is only one. The head of the delegation said that we view your struggle to recover Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu in the same way as we view the struggle of the people of Arab countries for national independence. We are fighting a common battle on different battlefields and are engaged in one struggle. Therefore, we hope that you will achieve victory in the struggle in the near future.

In his speech, the head of the delegation also talked about his impressions of visiting various places in China. He said that from the first minute they arrived in this beautiful country, they lived in deep friendship. "The friendly reception received during the visit to China is our valuable asset, but the greater wealth is what we have learned in China. We have seen the Chinese people working hard day and night to build their own happy future."

    彭真在招待伊拉克人民友好访华团宴会上说
    全世界人民风雨同舟应共济
    马哈茂德说伊拉克人民永不忘中国兄弟的支持
    新华社23日讯　彭真市长今晚在他举行的招待伊拉克人民友好访华团的宴会上说，中伊两国人民、亚非人民和全世界人民都是风雨同舟的人民，只要全世界各国人民团结起来共同进行斗争，帝国主义一定失败。
    彭真市长说，中国有一句老话叫
  “风雨同舟”。中伊两国人民，亚非人民，全世界各国人民都是风雨同舟的人民。中伊两国都有悠久的历史，悠久的文化，两国同样都长期遭受过帝国主义的压迫，我们先后都打倒了压迫我们的敌人取得了胜利。在胜利以后，两国人民面前还有一个共同的敌人，这就是帝国主义。在伊拉克人民革命胜利以后，美帝国主义就武装侵入了黎巴嫩，威胁着年青的伊拉克共和国的安全。就是这个同样的帝国主义者现在还霸占着我国的神圣领土台湾，并且不断对我们进行军事挑衅。威胁我们安全的都是共同的敌人。我们有共同利害的关系，没有利害的矛盾，这一点完全可以说明我们是风雨同舟的。
    彭真市长说，美帝国主义者不但自己制造了绞索套在自己的脖子上，而且正在自己勒紧这个绞索。就那么个美国，却同中国、伊拉克、亚非、拉丁美洲和全世界各国人民为敌。就那么一点力量，却分布在全世界各处。从古到今从来没有一个国家同这么许多国家的人民为敌而最后不遭受惨败的。只要全世界各国人民团结起来共同进行斗争，帝国主义一定失败。所以，中伊两国人民，亚非各国人民，全世界各国人民的团结是世界上头等重要的事情。伊拉克人民友好访华团访问中国是对中国人民的支持，我们也看成是头等重要的事情。
    马哈茂德团长接着讲话。他说，伊拉克人民和阿拉伯人民把中国人民看成是亚非人民大家庭中的老大哥，因为中国人民一贯支持阿拉伯人民的民族独立运动。在伊拉克人民革命胜利后的日子里，伊拉克人民从中国和其他社会主义国家中得到了宝贵的支持和帮助，它将永远留在我们的心里，我们和中国及其他社会主义国家之间的友谊和互相支持，将会永远保持下去。
    团长说，中东人民的任何胜利就是远东人民的胜利，远东人民的任何胜利也是中东人民的胜利。的确，我们是风雨同舟的兄弟，是共同战斗中的伙伴，我们的敌人是一个，我们的命运也只有一个。团长说，我们看你们收复台、澎、金、马的斗争，正像我们看阿拉伯各国人民争取民族独立的斗争一样，我们是在不同的战场上，进行着共同战斗，从事着一个斗争。因此，我们希望你们在最近的将来就能取得斗争的胜利。
    团长在讲话中还畅述了在中国各地参观访问的印象。他说，当他们到达这个美好国家的第一分钟起，就生活在深厚的友谊中。“访问中国期间所受到的友好接待是我们宝贵的财富，然而更大的财富却是在中国所学到的东西。我们看到中国人民夜以继日地辛勤劳动，来建设自己幸福的未来。”
