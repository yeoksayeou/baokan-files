Vice Chairman Zhu De, during his recent inspection of work in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, attended an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee. He listened to Comrade Wang Enmao's report on the situation in Xinjiang and made an important speech.

At the enlarged meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Standing Committee, Vice Chairman Zhu first gave a high appraisal of the work achievements in the Xinjiang region over the past nine years. He said that you have done a very good job and achieved great results under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; the work achievements of the Xinjiang Military Region and the Production and Construction Corps are also significant. Next, Vice Chairman Zhu gave instructions on the work of industry, agriculture, animal husbandry and other aspects in the Xinjiang region. In terms of industry, he said: While giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we must develop various industries to meet local needs. You have already "hung up the marshal" for grain here, but steel and machinery have not yet "hung up the marshal." One of the main reasons is that the "pioneer" has not been prepared. Transportation and the power industry are the "pioneers." When these two "pioneers" are ready, the marshal will be able to set up camp. Therefore, you must seize the opportunity to build railways and develop the power industry in order to greatly develop the steel and machinery industries. At the same time, we must also pay attention to developing various industries to meet local needs, such as light industry for daily necessities, the building materials industry, and the food processing industry. He also talked about developing industries to meet national needs. The Xinjiang region is vast, with more than 1.7 million square kilometers. The Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains, and the Pamir Plateau are all in this area, and the underground mineral deposits are abundant, especially oil, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and coal are extremely rich. You must greatly develop these industries to meet the needs of the country's socialist construction. He also said that it is necessary to develop industries to meet export needs. Xinjiang is rich in mineral products, animal products, silk, fruits, etc. It is necessary to develop the mining industry and processing industry to increase exports and exchange for machinery. Vice Chairman Zhu emphasized that the Autonomous Region must actively implement the policy of using local materials, blooming everywhere, and the whole people running industry, and greatly develop the local industry of the Autonomous Region.

In terms of agriculture, Vice Chairman Zhu first pointed out that large-scale land reclamation is conditional in Xinjiang. Your plan to reclaim 100 million mu of wasteland is also a major event in the country. He said that Xinjiang has several basins and several large mountains. Grass grows on the mountains and can be used for grazing, and the basins can be turned into fertile fields as long as there is water, which is in many ways no less than Jiangnan in inland China. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has set an example in land reclamation. In the future, the Autonomous Region must also greatly develop grain production, and at the same time greatly develop cotton, oil crops, melons and fruits, etc., so that Xinjiang can develop into one of the country's largest production bases for cotton, melons and fruits, etc. Water conservancy is the main guarantee for increased agricultural production, and must be vigorously promoted; snow water on the mountains and underground water must be utilized.

Vice Chairman Zhu particularly emphasized that Xinjiang should plant trees and create forests on a large scale, transform nature, and achieve greening. He said that so-called greening means that you can't see the Gobi Desert or beaches. Is Xinjiang so big, can it be greened? As long as the water problem is solved, it is possible to gradually green and gradually eliminate the desert. Overcoming nature and transforming nature is the goal of communism.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that in terms of animal husbandry, it is necessary to greatly develop various livestock. The total number of livestock in Xinjiang should be increased from the current 20 million to more than 100 million, so that Xinjiang can become one of the country's largest production bases for wool and meat.

Vice Chairman Zhu also gave instructions on the development of transportation in the Autonomous Region. He said that transportation is the pioneer for the development of industry, agriculture and animal husbandry, and it is even more important in Xinjiang. Because you have fewer people, the role of railways is even greater. Now the state advocates local railway construction, people of all ethnic groups build roadbeds, the state provides rails, and factories and communes can also invest in railway construction themselves, and the state can also provide rails. Highways mainly rely on communes, and highways must be well built. Kelamayi has a Black Oil Mountain, and all the asphalt can be moved down and used to pave roads all the way to Xi'an and Wuhan. Asphalt roads are cheap and good.

Vice Chairman Zhu instructed that the Autonomous Region should continue to strengthen unity among all ethnic groups. He said that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the ethnic problems in Xinjiang have been resolved well and important experiences have been gained. It is hoped that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will strive to become a model area of ​​national unity in the country.

Vice Chairman Zhu also gave important instructions on the people's commune movement in the Autonomous Region. He pointed out: The people's commune is a great force for promoting the further leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and scientific and cultural undertakings, the best organizational form for accelerating China's socialist construction and transitioning from socialism to communism in the future, and the best organizational form for realizing the arming of the whole people and strengthening China's national defense forces. The establishment of people's communes integrating workers, peasants, merchants, students and soldiers, and integrating townships and communes, is not only a great event in Chinese history, but also a great event in world history.

Finally, Vice Chairman Zhu called on the more than 130,000 Communist Party members, 160,000 Communist Youth League members, 600,000 workers and 6 million people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to further boost their energy, strive for progress, carry forward communist ideology and style, and quickly build the Autonomous Region into a socialist garden in a faster, better and more economical way, in order to prepare for the transition to communism together with all parts of the country.

From September 4th to 25th, Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for more than twenty days. The areas inspected included Urumqi City, Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Aksu, Kashgar, Hami Prefectures, Hutubi, Kuche, Turpan Counties, Dushanzi and Kelamayi oil mining areas, and the reclamation areas of the Xinjiang Military Region troops and the Production and Construction Corps in various places. Accompanying Vice Chairman Zhu to various places for inspection were Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat and Chairman of the Autonomous Region Saifuddin, and Chairman of the Autonomous Region Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan, and others.

When Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected various places, he went deep into factories, farms, people's communes, schools, and troops, met and talked with many cadres and masses, listened to reports from local party organizations, learned about local work, production, and the living conditions of people of all ethnic groups, conveyed the concern of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and gave many important instructions on the work in various places.

After Vice Chairman Zhu came to Urumqi, he attached great importance to the development of iron and steel, machinery and other industrial production in the Autonomous Region. During his stay in Urumqi, he first inspected five units including the Xinjiang "August 1" Iron and Steel Plant and the Urumqi Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant. After listening to the reports of the Xinjiang "August 1" Iron and Steel Plant and other units, Vice Chairman Zhu believed that the iron and steel and machinery industries of the Autonomous Region had overcome various difficulties and developed from nothing, from small to large, without an industrial base and inconvenient transportation in the past. This spirit is very good. He also encouraged everyone to carry forward the spirit of using indigenous methods to make iron and the communist style during the Yan'an period, and strive to complete this year's iron and steel and machinery production tasks in order to strive for a greater leap forward next year.

When Vice Chairman Zhu inspected Xinjiang College and Xinjiang Medical College, he checked the implementation of the Party's education policy in the Xinjiang region, inquired about the ideological transformation of ethnic minority intellectuals, and instructed that school education must strengthen political and ideological work.

When Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Preparatory Committee of the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he received Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who was inspecting work in Xinjiang, and a group of scientific workers in the Autonomous Region. Vice Chairman Zhu watched a batch of unearthed cultural relics and historical sites and had a cordial conversation with the scientific workers. Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that the Gobi Desert, the desert, and the ice on the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains can all be conquered by people; the ice and snow on the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains must be used to serve human life. Various mineral products, wild plants, animals and other wealth will be used by our hard-working and brave people of all ethnic groups to improve and improve their lives in the future. Vice Chairman Zhu also instructed researchers of ethnic history to pay attention to studying the history of the development of all ethnic groups after liberation, and not to value the ancient over the present.

Vice Chairman Zhu successively inspected the Shihezi and Usu reclamation areas, the Dushanzi and Kelamayi oil areas, and Yining City, the capital of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, in the northern Xinjiang region. On the way to Kelamayi, he visited the Yuanfeng, Dafeng, and Qijin agricultural cooperatives of the Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Ula Usu Army Reclamation Farm and Anjihai Mass Farm. Vice Chairman Zhu was very excited when he inspected the cotton, corn, sugar beets, soybeans, Sudan grass, and lush shelterbelts planted by the soldiers at the Ula Usu Army Reclamation Farm. Pointing to a cotton field of nearly a thousand acres, he said: Your crops are growing very well, I am afraid they are growing better than the crops in the best agricultural areas in the country. Xinjiang is a good place. Your place is a blank sheet of paper, you can draw the newest and most beautiful pictures. Whatever you want to draw, you can draw. Therefore, it is entirely possible to build this place into a model area of ​​communism.

Kelamayi is one of the important bases of China's petroleum industry. Vice Chairman Zhu personally saw the tremendous changes in all aspects here and was very happy. At a conference, he said to the cadres and advanced producers of all ethnic groups in the mining area: Three years ago, there was only an old Uyghur hunter here, but three years later, you have established a petroleum city of 40,000 people in this barren Gobi Desert. This is a great achievement. Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Zhang Yunqing drilling team, which created the highest national drilling footage record, the Wusouer installation team, which used tractors to transport large derricks in three dimensions, and the "March 8 Drilling Team" and "March 8 Refinery" organized by family members and operated oil wells. He said to the responsible comrades of the mining area party committee and advanced producers: The leap forward plan you have put forward is an inspiring plan. I believe you will be able to complete it on schedule and over fulfill it. The people of the whole country, the Party and the government are looking forward to you completing this great and arduous plan.

Vice Chairman Zhu came to Yining City, the capital of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, for inspection. This area is the center of the Three Districts Revolution in which the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang once launched an anti-Kuomintang reactionary rule. Vice Chairman Zhu received representatives of more than a dozen ethnic groups here and spoke to representatives and cadres of all ethnic groups. He said: Like other areas in Xinjiang, the Ili Autonomous Prefecture, under the leadership of the Party, has realized the close unity of all ethnic groups, forever eliminated national oppression, ethnic disputes and mutual distrust caused by the class exploitation system, and embarked on a new era of national equality, friendship, unity, mutual assistance, and mutual trust. Vice Chairman Zhu also said: National unity is the only way for multi-ethnic Xinjiang and the entire China to achieve victory in the cause of revolution and construction. The party organizations at all levels in the Xinjiang region, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have opposed the tendency of Han chauvinism that hinders national unity, and then opposed the tendency of local nationalism that hinders national unity, which is entirely necessary. Vice Chairman Zhu gave a high appraisal of the victory of the rectification and anti-local nationalism struggle in the Autonomous Region in recent years, pointing out that this is of great significance for accelerating socialist construction in minority areas, accelerating the economic and cultural development of minority nationalities, and enabling minority nationalities to jointly transition to communist society with the Han nationality and other fraternal ethnic groups. These measures have been firmly supported by the broad masses of people and cadres of all ethnic groups.

Vice Chairman Zhu De went to Kuche, Aksu and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang. In Kuche, he represented the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao to express condolences to the residents of all ethnic groups who had been affected by the floods not long ago. In addition to expressing his satisfaction with the disaster relief work of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, he also encouraged residents of all ethnic groups to work hard in production and rebuild the new Kuche city. In Kashgar City, Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Red Flag People's Commune in the suburbs, which was composed of more than 20,000 people, listened to the work reports of the CPC Kashgar Prefectural Committee, the CPC Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture Committee, and the CPC Hotan Prefectural Committee, and gave important instructions. Vice Chairman Zhu said: Like the rest of the country, Xinjiang is leaping forward by leaps and bounds on all production fronts. In this great leap forward, you must first focus on these three items: steel, machinery, and grain, especially steel and grain are more important. The grain problem has been basically solved in Xinjiang and the country this year. Therefore, from now on, the focus of the entire party's leadership must be placed on industry centered on steel. Because with steel, we can develop the machinery industry, develop all other industries, and realize the mechanization of agriculture and develop agriculture even more. The Xinjiang region is vast and transportation is inconvenient, so we must vigorously develop the transportation industry. We must also greatly develop the light industry of daily necessities, the building materials industry, and the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products. Xinjiang has a lot of raw materials. In developing local industry, we must adopt the policy of using local materials, blooming everywhere, and the whole people running industry. Vice Chairman Zhu was pleased that the People's Commune movement in Xinjiang was developing rapidly like the inland areas. Seeing that the foundation of the Red Flag People's Commune in the suburbs of Kashgar was very good, he encouraged them to strive to become a model commune in the country.

Vice Chairman Zhu also inspected the Wuxing People's Commune and Grape People's Commune in Turpan County, and the small indigenous blast furnace group of the Honglu Production Cooperative in Hami County for iron smelting production. In Hami, Vice Chairman Zhu inquired in detail about the progress of the construction of the Lanxin Railway and instructed relevant departments to seize the opportunity to build the roadbed and strive to open the railway to traffic as soon as possible.

During his inspection of Urumqi City and Yining City, Vice Chairman Zhu also laid wreaths in front of the tombs of martyrs Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and Ahemaitijiang.

Vice Chairman Zhu's inspection in Xinjiang gave great encouragement to the cadres and masses of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region. The cadres and masses of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region unanimously stated that they will resolutely implement Vice Chairman Zhu's instructions and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policies, boost their energy even more, unite as one, do a good job in the Autonomous Region, and make the socialist construction cause of the Autonomous Region achieve greater achievements.

    朱副主席视察天山南北时说
    新疆应建成模范自治区
    大大发展自治区地方工业和粮食生产，并使新疆成为全国最大的棉花、瓜果、羊毛和肉类生产基地之一。——科学工作者努力工作，一定要把天山、昆仑山、阿尔泰山的冰雪用来为人类生活服务；注意研究解放后新疆各民族发展的历史，不要厚古薄今。——民族团结，是全中国取得革命和建设事业胜利的唯一道路。整风和反地方民族主义斗争的胜利对少数民族地区的社会主义建设具有重大意义。
    新华社乌鲁木齐6日电　朱德副主席最近在新疆维吾尔自治区视察工作期间，出席了中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会召开的一次常委扩大会议，听取了王恩茂同志关于新疆工作情况的汇报，并作了重要的讲话。
    朱副主席在自治区党委常委扩大会议上，首先对新疆地区九年来的工作成绩作了很高的估价。他说，你们在党中央和毛主席的领导下工作得很好，成绩很大；新疆军区和生产建设兵团的工作成绩也是显著的。接着，朱副主席对新疆地区的工农牧业和其它方面工作作了指示。在工业方面：他说，要在优先发展重工业的同时，发展满足当地需要的各种工业。你们这里粮食是挂起帅了，但是钢铁和机械还没有挂起帅来。其中主要的原因之一是“先行”还没有准备好。交通运输、电力工业是“先行”，这两个“先行”准备好了，元帅就好升帐，因此你们必须抓紧修铁路和发展电力工业，以利于大大发展钢铁和机械工业。在此同时还要注意发展满足本地需要的各种工业，例如日用品轻工业、建筑材料工业、食品加工工业等。他又谈到要发展为满足全国需要的工业。新疆地区辽阔，有一百七十多万平方公里，天山、阿尔泰山、昆仑山、帕米尔高原都在这个区域里，地下矿藏丰富，特别是石油、有色金属、稀有金属、煤炭等极为丰富，你们必须大大发展这些工业，以满足国家社会主义建设的需要。他还说到，要发展为满足出口需要的工业。新疆盛产矿产品、畜产品、蚕丝、水果等，必须发展采矿业和加工工业，增加出口，换回机器。朱副主席强调指出，自治区今后必须积极贯彻就地取材、遍地开花、全民办工业的方针，大大发展自治区的地方工业。
    农业方面：朱副主席首先指出，大量开荒，在新疆是有条件的。你们计划开一亿亩荒地，在全国也是一件大事。他说，新疆有几个盆地，几个大山，山上长草可以放牧，盆地只要有水即可开成良田，在许多方面不亚于塞内的江南。新疆生产建设兵团在开荒方面已经树立了榜样。自治区今后还要大大发展粮食生产，同时要大量发展棉花、油料、瓜果等，使新疆发展成为全国最大的棉花、瓜果等的生产基地之一。水利是农业增产的主要保证，必须大搞；山上的雪水，地下的水，都要把它利用起来。
    朱副主席特别强调地指出，新疆要大量植树造林，改造自然，实现绿化。他说，所谓绿化，就是见不到戈壁、沙滩。新疆这么大，能不能绿化呢？只要解决了水的问题，就有可能逐步绿化，逐步消灭沙漠。战胜自然和改造自然，这就是共产主义的目的。
    朱副主席说，畜牧业方面，要大量发展各种牲畜。使新疆牲畜的总头数从现在的两千多万头，发展到一亿头以上，从而使新疆成为全国最大的羊毛和肉类生产基地之一。
    朱副主席对自治区发展交通运输事业也作了指示。他说，交通运输是发展工、农、牧业的先行，在新疆更为重要。因为你们人少，铁路的作用就更大。现在国家提倡地方修铁路，各族人民修路基，国家出铁轨，工厂、公社也可以自己投资修铁路，国家也可以给铁轨。公路主要依靠公社办，公路一定要修好。克拉玛依有个黑油山，把沥青统统搬下来，一直铺到西安、武汉都用不完，修成沥青路又便宜又好。
    朱副主席指示，自治区要继续加强各民族之间的团结。他说，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，新疆的民族问题是解决得好的，并且取得了重要的经验，希望新疆维吾尔自治区争取成为全国民族团结的模范地区。
    朱副主席对自治区人民公社化运动也作了重要指示。他指出：人民公社是推动我国工农业生产和科学文化事业进一步跃进的伟大力量，是加速我国社会主义建设、将来从社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好的组织形式，又是实现全民武装、加强我国国防力量的最好的组织形式。组织工农商学兵合一、乡社合一的人民公社，不仅是中国历史上的伟大事件，而且是世界历史上的伟大事件。
    朱副主席最后号召自治区十三万多共产党员、十六万共青团员、六十万职工和六百万各族人民进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，发扬共产主义思想和风格，多快好省地把自治区迅速建成为社会主义的大花园，以便准备和全国各地同时向共产主义过渡。
    朱德副主席9月4日到25日在新疆维吾尔自治区进行了二十几天的视察。视察的地区有乌鲁木齐市，伊犁哈萨克族自治州，昌吉回族自治州，阿克苏、喀什、哈密专区，呼图壁、库车、吐鲁番等县，独山子、克拉玛依石油矿区，新疆军区的部队和生产建设兵团在各地的垦区。陪同朱副主席前往各地视察的有中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂，书记处书记、自治区主席赛福鼎和政协自治区委员会主席包尔汉等。
    朱德副主席在各地视察的时候，曾深入到工厂、农场、人民公社、学校、部队，同许多干部和群众见面、谈话，听取各地党组织的汇报，了解当地的工作、生产情况和各族人民的生活状况，传达党中央和毛主席对新疆各族人民的关怀，并对各地工作作了许多重要的指示。
    朱副主席来到乌鲁木齐后，十分重视自治区钢铁、机械等工业生产发展的情况。在乌鲁木齐期间，首先视察了新疆“八一”钢铁厂和乌鲁木齐农业机械制造厂等五个单位。朱副主席听了新疆“八一”钢铁厂等单位的汇报后，认为自治区钢铁、机械工业在过去没有工业基础、交通不便的情况下，克服种种困难，从无到有、从小到大地发展起来，这种精神是很好的。他并勉励大家发扬在延安时期用土法炼铁的劲头和共产主义的风格，努力完成今年钢铁和机械生产的任务，以便争取明年更大的跃进。
    朱副主席在视察新疆学院和新疆医学院的时候，检查了党的教育工作方针在新疆地区贯彻执行的情况，询问了少数民族知识分子思想改造进行的情况，并指示学校教育必须加强政治、思想工作。
    朱副主席在中国科学院新疆分院筹备委员会视察的时候，接见了正在新疆检查工作的中国科学院副院长竺可祯和自治区的一批科学工作者。朱副主席观看了一批出土文物古迹，同科学工作者们作了亲切的谈话。朱副主席指出，新疆的戈壁、沙漠、冰大坂，都是可以被人们征服的；天山、昆仑山、阿尔泰山的冰雪，一定要使它为人类生活服务。各种矿产、野生植物、动物等财富，将来都会被我们勤劳而勇敢的各族人民用来改善和提高自己的生活。朱副主席并指示研究民族历史的人员，要注意研究解放后各民族发展的历史，不要厚古薄今。
    朱副主席在北疆地区先后视察了石河子、乌苏垦区和独山子、克拉玛依油区及伊犁哈萨克族自治州首府伊宁市。在赴克拉玛依途中，访问了昌吉回族自治州的园丰、大丰、旗进农业社和乌拉乌苏军垦农场、安集海群众农庄。朱副主席在乌拉乌苏军垦农场视察战士们种的棉花、玉米、甜菜、大豆、苏丹草和茂盛的防护林带的时候，异常兴奋。他指着近千亩大的一块棉田说：你们的庄稼长得真好，恐怕比全国最好的农业区庄稼都长得还要好。新疆是个好地方。你们这里是一张白纸，可以画最新最美的图画。要画什么，就是什么。因此，把这个地方建设成为共产主义的模范区是完全可能的。
    克拉玛依是我国石油工业重要基地之一。朱副主席亲眼看到了这里各方面的巨大变化，十分高兴。他在一次大会上，对矿区的各族干部和先进生产者们说：在三年以前，这里只有一个打猎的维吾尔族老人，可是三年以后，你们在这荒凉的戈壁滩上，已经建立起一座四万人口的石油城市，这是一个很大的成绩。朱副主席视察了创造全国钻井进尺最高纪录的张云清钻井队、采用拖拉机立体搬运大井架的乌受尔安装队和家属们组织起来的“三八钻井队”、“三八炼油厂”及喷油井的操作以后，向矿区党委负责同志和先进生产者们说：你们所提出的大跃进计划，是一个鼓舞人心的计划，我相信你们一定能够如期完成并且超额完成。全国人民、党和政府都在盼望着你们完成这个伟大而艰巨的计划。
    朱副主席来到伊犁哈萨克族自治州的首府——伊宁市进行视察。这个地区是新疆各族人民曾经举行过反对国民党反动统治的三区革命的中心。朱副主席在这里接见了十多个民族的代表，并对各族代表和干部讲了话。他说：伊犁自治州和新疆其他地区一样，各族人民在党的领导下，实现了各民族的紧密团结，永远消灭了由阶级剥削制度造成的民族压迫、民族纷争和互不信任的现象，而走上了民族平等友爱、团结互助、互相信任的新时代。朱副主席还说：民族团结是多民族的新疆和全中国取得革命和建设事业胜利的唯一道路。新疆地区党的各级组织，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，在反对了妨害民族团结的大汉族主义的倾向之后，又反对了妨害民族团结的地方民族主义倾向，这是完全必要的。朱副主席对于近年来自治区整风和反地方民族主义斗争的胜利作了很高的估价，指出这对于加速少数民族地区社会主义建设，加速少数民族经济文化的发展，使少数民族与汉民族等兄弟民族共同过渡到共产主义社会具有重大意义。这些措施得到了各民族广大人民群众和干部的坚决支持。
    朱德副主席到了南疆的库车、阿克苏和喀什市。在库车，他代表中共中央、中央人民政府和毛主席慰问了不久前因洪水而受灾害的各族居民。他除了对自治区党的救灾工作表示满意以外，并勉励各族居民大家努力生产，重建新的库车城。朱副主席在喀什市，视察了郊区由两万多人组成的红旗人民公社，听取了中共喀什地委、中共克孜勒苏克尔克孜族自治州州委和中共和阗地委的工作汇报，并作了重要的指示。朱副主席说：新疆和全国一样，在各个生产战线上正在一日千里地跃进。在这个大跃进中，你们首先要抓住钢铁、机械、粮食这三项，特别是钢铁和粮食更为重要。粮食问题在新疆和全国今年都已得到基本解决。所以，从现在起，全党的领导重点必须放到以钢铁为中心的工业方面来。因为有了钢铁才能发展机械工业，才能发展一切其他工业，才能实现农业机械化更大地发展农业。新疆地区辽阔，交通不便，因此必须大力发展交通运输业。关于日用必需品的轻工业、建筑材料工业以及农副产品的加工工业，也必须大大发展。新疆的原料很多，在发展地方工业上，必须采取就地取材，遍地开花，全民办工业的方针。朱副主席对新疆人民公社化运动和内地一样发展迅速，感到高兴，看到喀什郊区红旗人民公社的基础很好，鼓励他们争取成为全国的一个模范公社。
    朱副主席还视察了吐鲁番县的五星人民公社、葡萄人民公社和哈密县红炉生产合作社的小土高炉群的炼铁生产。朱副主席在哈密详细地询问了兰新铁路修建进展的情况，并指示有关部门抓紧修好路基，争取铁路提早通车。
    朱副主席在视察乌鲁木齐市和伊宁市期间，还分别到陈潭秋、毛泽民等烈士及阿合买提江烈士陵墓前献了花圈。
    朱副主席在新疆的视察，给了自治区各族干部和群众极大的鼓舞。自治区各族干部和群众一致表示，要坚决贯彻执行朱副主席的指示和党中央、毛主席的方针政策，更加鼓足干劲，团结一致，做好自治区的工作，使自治区的社会主义建设事业获得更大的成就。（附图片）
