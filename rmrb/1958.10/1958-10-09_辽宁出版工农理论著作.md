    Liaoning Publishes Workers' and Peasants' Theoretical Works
    In recent months, workers and peasants in Liaoning Province have launched a high tide of theoretical study. In the high tide of study, many workers and peasants, combined with their own work and thoughts, have written many excellent papers, which will be compiled and published by Liaoning People's Publishing House.
    Recently, the following books are planned to be published: "Mao Zedong's Works are the Lighthouse Guiding Us Forward." This book selects articles written by several workers from Shenyang Liming Machinery Factory. These articles reflect how they have improved their thinking and promoted production after studying Mao Zedong's works such as "On Contradiction." There are also "Theory is Not Mysterious, Farmers Can Learn and Use It," "On the Role of Communist Party Members," "On the Glory of Big-Character Posters," "On the Political and Economic Significance of the Great King's Field," and "On the Socialization of Housework." These books are selected from a large number of papers written by farmers from Xinfashe Cooperative in Huangsha Township, Tai'an County. These papers were written in the spirit of "do what you do, write what you do" and "learn and use at the same time" after they studied the theory. The content is specific and well-founded.

    辽宁出版工农理论著作
    近几个月来，辽宁省的工人、农民掀起了一个学理论的高潮。在学习高潮中，不少工人农民结合自己的工作和思想，写出了不少优秀的论文，这些论文将由辽宁人民出版社汇编出版。
    最近准备出版的有“毛主席著作是指引我们前进的灯塔”，这本书，选编了沈阳黎明机械厂几个工人写的文章，这些文章反映了他们学习毛主席的“矛盾论”等著作后，如何提高了思想，推动了生产。还有“理论并不神秘，农民能学又会用”、“论共产党员的作用”、“论大字报的荣誉”、“论大王田的政治经济意义”、“论家务劳动社会化”，这几本书，都是从台安县黄沙乡新发社农民写的大批论文中选编成的。这些论文是他们学习理论以后，本着“做什么，写什么”、“边学边用”的精神写成的。内容具体，有理有据。
