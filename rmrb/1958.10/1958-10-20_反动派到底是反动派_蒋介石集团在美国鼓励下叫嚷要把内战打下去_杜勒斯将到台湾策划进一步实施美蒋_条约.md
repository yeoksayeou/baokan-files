Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Taipei news: These past few days, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan has been constantly clamoring for "counterattacking the mainland," insisting on continuing the civil war with the support of U.S. war and aggression policies.

According to a report published in the Hong Kong "De Chen West Post" by Australian journalist Warner, Chiang Kai-shek met with this journalist in Taipei on the 14th. When the journalist asked Chiang Kai-shek about his current plans, Chiang Kai-shek replied, "We have every reason to believe that our efforts to recover the mainland will succeed." Chiang Kai-shek said that perhaps this cannot be easily achieved in the eyes of the Western public, "but we believe that this is completely achievable, feasible and realistic."

When talking about "the fact that the Communists seem to have seized the initiative," Chiang Kai-shek tried his best to encourage Western countries to take unified action in interfering in China's internal affairs. He said: "Only when Western countries decide to take collective action can they seize the initiative from the Communists." He complained that the time was not yet fully ripe, and that "Western countries still lack the necessary determination and courage to face the problem."

Chiang Kai-shek also told Warner that if fighting resumed, the Chiang Kai-shek clique was "ready to go back, and go back fiercely, especially in the issue of coastal islands." He also clamored that as to whether the war should be carried out to the mainland, "that depends on the situation."

Chiang Kai-shek said that he had "not considered the issue of withdrawing troops from the coastal islands." For him, it was "no retreat, no appeasement, and be ready to deal with force with greater force at any time."

On the 17th, Chiang Kai-shek also gave an interview to McGregor, a reporter for the "New York Times." The "New York Times" reported that Chiang Kai-shek told McGregor, "We are definitely determined to hold on to the coastal islands." "If we withdraw from these islands under pressure," then "the hope of counterattacking the mainland will be shattered."

In his conversation, he opposed the "New York Times" editorial published on the 16th advocating for the withdrawal of Chiang's army from Kinmen and Matsu. He said, "It seems that some people in the United States believe that the troops of the National Government (Chiang Kai-shek clique) should be transferred back from the coastal islands to strengthen the defense of Taiwan and Penghu. But doing so will have a very bad effect on morale, and it will have extremely adverse effects. People will ask: 'If the United States wants us to do this, then won't they also abandon us in the matter of defending Taiwan?'" Chiang Kai-shek said that doing so would "lose confidence in the United States."

Chiang Kai-shek said, "We hope to emphasize again the importance of Kinmen as a barrier to the entire U.S. position in the West Pacific." He advocated, "Kinmen, Matsu and other coastal islands must be held because they are essential to defending the Taiwan Strait and the West Pacific."

While Chiang Kai-shek continued to make these statements, "Vice President" Chen Cheng also told reporters on the 14th that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's troops "will never withdraw" from the coastal islands, and "the issue of reducing the garrison on the coastal islands is out of the question."

The Taiwan authorities' "ambassador" to the United States, Yeh Kung-chao, also gave a speech in the United States on the 16th, emphasizing that Kinmen and Matsu are "located within the important positions facing the Communist ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou," and "occupy an extremely important strategic position." He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "has no intention of abandoning these islands."

According to U.S. news agencies, in the past two weeks, the United States has taken frantic steps to step up the delivery of missiles, airplanes, tanks, artillery and many other military materials to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's troops for use. A large number of U.S. 155mm caliber cannons and 8-inch caliber howitzers provided to strengthen Chiang's army's firepower have been shipped to Kinmen, and a large number of U.S.-made shells and other military materials bearing the markings "United States of America·Foreign Aid" are also continuously pouring onto Kinmen beaches. A military spokesman for the Taiwan authorities announced on the 17th that Chiang's army entrenched in Kinmen continued to "blockade" the port of Xiamen.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Taipei news: The U.S. "Embassy" in Taipei announced today that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will arrive in Taipei from Rome at 7:00 AM on the 21st. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor and U.S. Commander of the Pacific Armed Forces White will arrive in Taipei on the same day as Dulles. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson and the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "ambassador" to Washington, Yeh Kung-chao, will arrive in Taipei on the evening of the 20th.

The news revealed that Dulles's visit to Taipei this time is to step up helping Chiang Kai-shek plan military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area and conspire to launch new acts of aggression against the Chinese people.

According to American sources in Taipei, Dulles will hold several talks with Chiang Kai-shek during his three-day visit to Taipei. General Taylor will also attend some of the talks.

This is Dulles's fifth visit to Taiwan.

U.S. news agencies reported that, according to "authoritative" sources in Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek expects Dulles to be able to promise the so-called "security" of the inland sea islands of mainland China during his visit to Taipei, which means that the United States must guarantee direct intervention when the Chinese people liberate Kinmen and Matsu. Jiang Yisheng, a spokesperson for Taiwan's "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," also said that the invitation to Dulles to visit was to "further implement" the current U.S.-Chiang military treaty.

A report by UPI said that Dulles would probably make all possible assurances to Chiang Kai-shek, guaranteeing that the United States would continue to give Chiang Kai-shek support and cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks on October 14th have aroused much discussion in the British and American press.

The British "Times" said that Dulles "has spoken many different opinions at different moments," and "he has obviously retreated from the position two weeks ago."

"Daily Express" said, "Mr. Dulles's diplomatic dance steps took a smooth turn today on the troubled coastal islands of Kinmen and Matsu. He cooperated with his dance partner, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of Nationalist China, and skillfully completed the dance."

"Daily Mail" pointed out that "Dulles has turned to a tough stance again." "The United States will not exchange peace in the Taiwan Strait by handing over the Kinmen and Matsu Islands to the Communists."

The "Scotsman" believes that Dulles's so-called "flexibility" in his U.S. policy on September 30th "cannot be seen" from Dulles's remarks on the 14th.

The American "Washington Post" analyzed Dulles's talks on September 30th and October 14th in an editorial on the 16th, and pointed out the difference in attitudes between the two talks. The newspaper said that he "may have been persuaded by fanatics." The newspaper pointed out in another editorial on the 18th that it would be "very foolish" if the Eisenhower government took "this temporary ceasefire as an excuse for doing nothing about its involvement in the crisis on the coastal islands." The New York "Daily News" said on the 16th, "One day, the Secretary of State said that it was stupid to strengthen the Kinmen garrison, and hinted that he would try to get Chiang Kai-shek to reduce this garrison. Later, he said that he would not force Chiang Kai-shek to do anything. No one can guess what he will say tomorrow or the day after."

    反动派到底是反动派
    蒋介石集团在美国鼓励下叫嚷要把内战打下去
    杜勒斯将到台湾策划进一步实施美蒋“条约”
    新华社19日讯　台北消息：这几天来，台湾蒋介石集团在不断叫嚷“反攻大陆”，坚持要在美国战争侵略政策的支持下把内战打下去。
    根据澳大利亚记者华尔纳在香港“德臣西报”发表的报道，蒋介石14日在台北会见了这个记者。这个记者问到蒋介石目前的打算如何，蒋介石回答说，“我们有一切理由相信，我们收复大陆的努力将会成功。”蒋介石说，也许在西方公众看来，这是不能轻易实现的，“但是，我们认为这是完全做得到的、可行而现实的事情。”
    在谈到“共产党看来掌握了主动这个事实”的时候，蒋介石尽力鼓吹西方国家在干涉中国内政这一件事上采取一致行动。他说：“只有在西方国家决定采取集体行动的时候，才能从共产党那里夺取主动权。”他抱怨这个时机还不完全成熟，“西方国家还缺乏面对问题应有的决心和勇气”。
    蒋介石还对华尔纳说，如果恢复战斗，蒋介石集团“准备回去，而且狠狠地回去，在沿海岛屿问题上情况尤其如此”。他并且叫嚷，至于是否要把战争进行到大陆上去，“那要看情况而定”。
    蒋介石说，他“没有考虑过从沿海岛屿撤退军队的问题”，对他说来，是“不撤退，不姑息，随时准备以更大的武力来对付武力”。
    17日，蒋介石又对“纽约时报”记者麦克雷戈发表了谈话。“纽约时报”报道，蒋介石对麦克雷戈说，“我们肯定决心扼守沿海岛屿。”“如果我们在压力下撤出这些岛屿”，那末“反攻大陆的希望将告幻灭”。
    他在谈话里反对“纽约时报”16日发表的主张蒋军撤出金马的社论。他说，“看来美国有人认为，应该把国民政府（蒋介石集团）军队从沿海岛屿调回来，加强台湾和澎湖的防御。但是这样做对于士气会产生极坏的影响，这样做会产生极其不利的影响。人们会问：‘如果美国会要我们这样做，那末他们在防卫台湾这个问题上不会也撒手不管我们吗？’”蒋介石说，这样做会“对美国失去信心”。
    蒋介石说，“我们希望再次强调金门作为整个西太平洋美国阵地的屏障的重要性。”他鼓吹，“必须守住金门、马祖和其他沿海岛屿，因为它们是保卫台湾海峡和西太平洋必不可少的。”
    在蒋介石连续发表这些谈话的同时，“副总统”陈诚也在14日对新闻记者表示，蒋介石集团军队“决不会撤出”沿海岛屿，“减少沿海岛屿的驻军问题是谈不上的”。
    台湾当局驻美国的“大使”叶公超16日也在美国发表演说，着重说明金门和马祖“位于面对共产党港口厦门和福州这些重要阵地之内”，“居于极重要的战略地位”。他说，蒋介石集团“无意放弃这些岛屿”。
    据美国通讯社报道，在最近两周里，美国采取了疯狂的步骤来加紧把导弹、飞机、坦克、大炮及其他许多军事物资交给蒋介石集团军队使用。为了加强蒋军火力而提供的大批美国一五五毫米口径大炮和八英寸口径榴弹炮已经运到金门，大量带着“美利坚合众国·外援”字样的标记的美制炮弹及其他军事物资也在陆续不断地涌到金门海滩。台湾当局军事发言人17日宣布，盘踞在金门的蒋军继续在对厦门港口进行“封锁”。
    新华社18日讯　台北消息：美国驻台北的“大使馆”今天宣布，美国国务卿杜勒斯将在21日上午七点从罗马到达台北。和杜勒斯同一天到达台北的有美国陆军参谋长泰勒以及美国驻太平洋武装部队司令怀特。美国国务院助理国务卿罗伯逊和蒋介石集团驻华盛顿“大使”叶公超将在20日晚上抵达台北。
    消息透露，杜勒斯这次来台北是为了加紧帮助蒋介石策划在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和阴谋布置对中国人民的新的侵略活动。
    据台北的美国人士说，杜勒斯在台北的三天访问期间将同蒋介石进行好几次会谈。泰勒将军也将参加其中的几次会谈。
    这是杜勒斯第五次前来台湾。
    美国通讯社报道，据“权威的”台湾方面人士说，蒋介石期望杜勒斯这次来台北能够答应“保证”中国大陆内海岛屿的所谓“安全”，这就是说，要美国保证在中国人民解放金门、马祖的时候直接插手干涉。台湾的“外交部”发言人江易生也说，邀请杜勒斯来访问是为了“进一步实施”目前的美蒋军事条约。
    合众国际社的一条消息说，杜勒斯大概将向蒋介石提出一切可能的保证，担保美国继续给予蒋介石支持，并且同蒋介石合作。
    新华社19日讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯10月14日的谈话，引起了英国和美国报刊议论纷纷。
    英国的“泰晤士报”说，杜勒斯“在不同的时刻讲了许多不同的意见”，“他显然是从两星期前的立场倒退。”
      “每日快报”说，“杜勒斯先生的外交舞步，今天在麻烦的沿海岛屿金门和马祖问题上来了一个圆滑的转弯。他同舞伴、国民党中国的蒋介石委员长配合，巧妙地跳完了舞。”
    “每日邮报”指出“杜勒斯又转而采取强硬态度。”“美国将不在福摩萨海峡用将金门群岛和马祖列岛交给共产党人的办法来换取和平。”
    “苏格兰人报”认为，从杜勒斯14日的谈话“看不出来”他的9月30日所说的美国政策的所谓“灵活性”。
    美国的“华盛顿邮报”16日在社论中对杜勒斯9月30日和10月14日的谈话进行了分析以后，指出了两次谈话中的态度的不同。这家报纸说，他“也许被狂热分子说服了”。这家报纸在18日的另一篇社论中指出，如果艾森豪威尔政府把“这种暂时停火对它卷入沿海岛屿的危机的做法不作任何事情的借口，那是非常愚蠢的”。纽约“每日新闻”16日说，“某一天，国务卿说加强金门守军的做法是愚蠢的，并且暗示他将设法使蒋介石减少这支守军。后来，他又说他不会强使蒋介石做任何事情。谁也猜不透，明天或者后天他究竟又会说些什么。”
