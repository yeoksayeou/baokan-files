    Nostalgia for the South
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Xiong
    The news of the Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw troops from Korea has spread to every corner of South Korea. With incomparable excitement, the South Korean people express their deep respect for this major step taken by the Volunteers for peace and are extremely resentful of the American aggressor troops who continue to occupy South Korea.

    Many people from South Korea have brought vivid stories of the people there praising and cherishing the Volunteers.

    In the spring of 1951, on both sides of the Han River and on the banks of the Zhaoyang River, on Baiyun Mountain and Daofeng Mountain, in the Iron Triangle and the Hengcheng area, the heroic deeds of the Volunteers left an unforgettable impression on the people in the southern half. People on the south bank of the Han River still tell the story of how a Volunteer soldier threw himself at a group of American soldiers with his body engulfed in flames from an enemy incendiary bomb, perishing with the enemy.

    Those who have always lived south of the 38th parallel praise the Volunteers as an "army of benevolence and courage" or "an army of benevolence and righteousness." They often talk about how the Volunteers rescued children from raging fires, how they treated critically ill Korean elders, how they fought while starving themselves, and how they saved military rations to help the people in the war zone. This is a story circulating in the Suwon area: In a battle on the south bank of the Han River, when American beasts drove groups of Korean women and children to shield their soldiers, the Volunteer soldiers preferred to endure greater losses, rescuing these innocent women and children before striking the enemy.

    In the areas of South Korea where the Volunteers once passed through, the common people still often feel honored to have had Volunteers stay in their homes or to have sung and talked with the Volunteers. People in the Hengcheng area often proudly talk about how they risked enemy bombing and strafing to deliver food to the Volunteers. Many people also secretly keep souvenirs left by the Volunteers, including Chairman Mao badges, as well as apology notes and Korean currency left by Volunteer soldiers after eating sweet potatoes and apples they found without finding the owner.

    Every Spring Festival and holiday, South Koreans secretly commemorate the Volunteers in various ways. One year, on October 25th, the Lee Seung-man gang convened a so-called "County People's Congress Against the Chinese Communist Army's Participation in the Korean War" in a certain place. Under the threat of bayonets and clubs, the local people not only did not participate, but instead turned this day into a festival of resistance against the US-Lee rule and commemoration of the Volunteers' resistance against US aggression and aid to Korea. In a certain place in South Korea, a brave and respectable Korean sister-in-law bravely rescued a dying Volunteer soldier on the battlefield more than seven years ago. When this soldier unfortunately passed away, she secretly buried him at the foot of a mountain. For several years, every Tomb-Sweeping Day, she would go to sweep his grave. Her family of five, including her beloved children, had successively died under American bombs and bayonets.

    In areas where the Volunteers had not previously been, the Volunteers' military prestige and political qualities also had a profound influence. On the banks of the Nakdong River, on Geoje Island, and in many other places, people everywhere spread various legends about the Volunteers. A student from South Korea studying at Songdo Political and Economic University in Kaesong said that his family was originally a feudal family, and the elders all believed in "Confucianism." They all believed that the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea was just like the Ming Dynasty Li Rusong's army's participation in the war to resist Japanese aggression and aid Korea during the "Imjin War" more than 360 years ago, which was just and a traditional fighting friendship between China and Korea. In the past, Li Rusong used the "tactics of summoning wind and rain" and worked with the famous Korean general Yi Sun-sin to defeat the Japanese pirates, which was historically called "the prosperity of Rusong." Today, the Volunteers and the People's Army have once again used more novel and ingenious tactics to defeat the American army. This is "the prosperity of Mao's red army," that is, the prosperity of Mao Zedong's Red Army. People in the Gyeongsangbuk-do area all say: The Volunteers are the most moral and bravest people. Residents of the East Sea coast and under the Daebaek Mountains also cited the example of a Volunteer unit infiltrating the enemy's interior during the Fifth Campaign and annihilating the enemy, saying: "The Volunteers can fly down from the sky, emerge from the mountains, travel hundreds of miles a day, go without food for several days, fight during the day without fear of airplanes, and drive cars in the pitch dark." Others said that the Volunteers have the art of divine calculation and unpredictable methods, which can make cowardly people brave and discern the tricks of treacherous people. They all envied the people in the northern half of the country for being able to fight and live together with such a good army, saying that the northern half of the country had made a "red" fortune, while the southern half, under the rampant tyranny of the US military, had suffered a "catastrophe."

    The vast number of soldiers of the Lee puppet army also inwardly admired the Volunteers' brave fighting style, excellent political qualities, and humanitarian spirit towards prisoners. Many former soldiers of the Lee puppet army have said that what moved the soldiers of the Lee puppet army the most was that the Volunteers treated prisoners with more respect than the American soldiers treated the Lee puppet army units. When fighting the enemy, the Volunteers were resolute and ruthless, but when the enemy laid down their weapons or were wounded and captured, they were immediately given proper care. An officer of the Lee puppet army who revolted said that among the soldiers of the Lee puppet army, there is now a growing tendency to admire their combat opponents—the Volunteers and the People's Army.

    Like an inexhaustible wildfire, everywhere in South Korea, one can hear people softly but affectionately singing "Kim Il-sung's Song," "The East is Red," and "The Volunteers' War Song." Because of their nostalgia for the People's Army and the Volunteers, many people have also composed some songs themselves. A song popular in a certain place called "Nostalgia for the South" includes the following lyrics about the Volunteers:

    Wind, can you transmit a message for me?
    Bird, can you cross the dividing line?
    Tell the dear Volunteers!
    We miss you day and night!

    In order to express their nostalgia for the Volunteers, many people have also written many "unstamped letters of appreciation" to the Volunteers over the years. Now, upon hearing that the Volunteers are withdrawing from Korea and returning to their country, and that the northern half of the Republic is signing a letter of gratitude to the Volunteers nationwide, many people in the southern half are also spontaneously and quietly writing farewell letters to the Volunteers. A group of South Korean youths expressed to the Volunteers in their letters: "We, a group of people living under the rule of the American-made modern Lee Dynasty, miss you at all times." "We must drive the American barbarians out of Korea, and our Republic must be peacefully reunified. Let us speak our minds freely again on the day of complete victory!" An educator from South Korea said it well: The US military has sown the seeds of disaster and hatred in Korea, while the Volunteers have sown the seeds of happiness and friendship in Korea. The volcano of hatred will eventually erupt, and the flower of friendship will surely bloom in the hearts of all the Korean people.

### 南方的怀念

    南方的怀念
    新华社记者　徐熊
    中国人民志愿军从朝鲜主动撤军的消息，传遍了南朝鲜的每一个角落。南朝鲜人民以无比激动的心情对志愿军这种为和平而采取的重大步骤，表示深深的敬意，并对仍继续霸占南朝鲜的美国侵略军万分愤恨。
    许多来自南朝鲜的人，带来了那里的人们歌颂和怀念志愿军的生动故事。
    1951年春，在汉江南北和照阳江畔，在白云山和道峰山上，在铁三角和横城地带，志愿军英勇作战的事迹给南半部人们留下了永世难忘的印象。汉江南岸的人们至今还传颂着一个志愿军战士，如何用自己被敌人燃烧弹打中了的身子扑向一群美国兵而和敌人同归于尽的故事。
    那些一直居住在三八线南的人们，称赞志愿军是“仁勇之军”或“仁义之师”。他们常常谈起，当年志愿军如何从烈火中抢救出幼儿，如何医治好病危中的朝鲜老人，如何自己饿着肚子打仗，省下军粮救济战区人民。这是流传在水原一带的故事：在汉江南岸一次战斗中，当美国兽军驱使成群的朝鲜妇女和儿童掩护他们士兵作战时，志愿军战士宁可忍受较大的损失，在抢救出这些无辜妇婴以后，再去打击敌人。
    在南朝鲜志愿军当年所经过的地方，老百姓现在还常常以他们从前家中住过志愿军或者同志愿军一起唱过歌、谈过话而感到光彩。横城地区人们常骄傲地谈起，当年他们冒着敌机轰炸扫射为志愿军送饭的事迹。也有许多人还暗暗保存着志愿军所留下的纪念品。其中有毛主席纪念章，也有志愿军战士吃了当时找不到物主的地蛋、苹果以后所留下的道歉信和朝鲜币。
    每逢过年过节，南朝鲜人就用各种各样方式来暗暗纪念志愿军。有一年10月25日，李承晚匪帮在某地召开一个所谓“反对中共军入朝参战郡民大会”。当地人民在刺刀和木棍的威胁下，不但不去参加，反而纷纷把这天变成反抗美李统治和纪念志愿军抗美援朝的一个节日。南朝鲜某地有一位英勇可敬的朝鲜嫂嫂在七年多前，曾英勇地在战场上抢救了一位垂死的志愿军战士。当这个战士不幸逝世后，她偷偷地把他埋葬在一处山脚下。几年来，每逢清明节，她总要去为他扫一次墓。她家有五口人，包括她心爱的孩子在内，都先后死在美国人的炸弹和刺刀之下。
    在志愿军过去未曾到过的地区，志愿军的军威和政治品质也有着深远的影响。在洛东江畔、在巨济岛上，在许许多多地方，人们到处流传着关于志愿军的各种各样传说。在开城松都政治经济大学读书的一位家住南朝鲜的学生说，他家本是一个封建家庭，老人们都信“儒教”。他们都认为，中国人民志愿军出兵抗美援朝，就如同三百六十多年前的“壬辰战争”时期明朝李如松军队出兵抗日援朝一样，是正义的，是中朝传统的战斗友谊。过去李如松曾用“呼风唤雨之战术”，和朝鲜名将李舜臣一起击败了日寇，史称“如松之盛”。今天志愿军又和人民军一起用更加新奇巧妙之战法，打败了美国军队，这是“毛红之盛”，即毛泽东红军的兴盛。庆尚北道一带的人都说：志愿军是最有道德、最勇敢的人。东海滨、大白山下的居民还引证志愿军一支部队在第五次战役穿插到敌人内脏里把敌人歼灭了的事例说：“志愿军能从天上飞下来，从山中钻出来，能日行数百里，能几天不吃饭，白天打仗不怕飞机，黑漆地里也能开汽车。”还有人说，志愿军有神机妙算之术，有神出鬼没之法，能使胆小的人勇敢，能识穿奸人鬼计。他们都羡慕北半部人民能和这样的好军队共同战斗、共同生活，说这是北半部交了“红”运，而在美军横行霸道下的南半部遭到了“劫数”。
    李伪军的广大士兵，也对志愿军勇敢的战斗作风、优良的政治品质和对俘虏的人道主义精神，内心感到钦佩。许多前李伪军的士兵都谈到，李伪军士兵最受感动的，是志愿军对待俘虏比美国士兵对待李伪军部队还要尊重一些。志愿军在同敌人作战的时候，坚决而无情，可是当敌人放下武器或者负伤被俘的时候，却立即给予妥善的照顾。一个起义的李伪军军官说，在李伪军士兵中，现在正增长一种爱慕他们的作战对象——志愿军和人民军的倾向。
    像扑不尽的野火，在南朝鲜到处可以听到人们在低声地但却是深情地唱“金日成之歌”、“东方红”和“志愿军战歌”。由于怀念人民军和志愿军，许多人还自编了一些歌曲。有一首在某地流行的叫做“南方的怀念”的歌词中，对志愿军的部分是这样写的：
    风呀，你能替我传送消息吗？
    鸟呀，你能穿过分界线吗？
    告诉亲爱的志愿军呵！
    我们在日夜怀念你！
    许多人为了表达向志愿军的怀念之情，几年来还向志愿军写了不少“未付邮的慰问信”。现在，当听到志愿军从朝鲜撤军回国，而共和国北半部又正在全民签字向志愿军写感谢信的时候，南半部也有许多人自发地、悄悄地向志愿军写送行信。一群南朝鲜青年们在信上向志愿军表示：“我们这群生活在美制的现代李氏王朝统治下的人们，无时无刻不在怀念你们。”“我们一定要把美国野蛮人逐出朝鲜，我们的共和国一定要和平统一。让我们在将来全胜之日，再畅诉心怀吧！”一位来自南朝鲜的教育工作者说得好：美军在朝鲜撒下的是灾难和仇恨的种子，志愿军在朝鲜播下的是幸福和友爱的种子。仇恨的火山终将爆发，而友爱之花也一定会盛开在全朝鲜人民的心上。
