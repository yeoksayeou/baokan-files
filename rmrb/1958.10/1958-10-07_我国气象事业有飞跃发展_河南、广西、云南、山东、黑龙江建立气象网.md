Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: Under the guidance of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running meteorological undertakings, China's meteorological undertakings have undergone a leap forward development. As of September 30th, according to incomplete statistics from twenty-two provinces and autonomous regions, since July, 53 special district meteorological observatories, 326 county-level meteorological (observation) stations, 12,878 people's commune or agricultural cooperative meteorological outposts, and 122,237 meteorological groups have been newly established. The five provinces (regions) of Henan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shandong, and Heilongjiang have achieved the goal of having meteorological observatories in every special district, meteorological (observation) stations in every county, meteorological outposts in every township (or people's commune), and meteorological groups in every natural village or production team.

As soon as the meteorological organizations in various places were established, they closely combined with the local production needs at the time and effectively carried out meteorological service work to ensure the realization of agricultural production increase tasks. The meteorological outpost of Liaohe Village, Nanyang County, Henan Province, started making weather forecasts on the second day of its establishment, telling the members that the weather was fine that day, and the members applied "666" pesticide powder to the cotton; another day, the members were preparing to apply pesticide powder to the cotton again, and the meteorological outpost told the members that there would be thunderstorms that day, so the members did not apply pesticide powder, and as a result, it rained heavily. Therefore, the masses strongly support the large-scale development of meteorological work.

The reasons why the meteorological undertaking can develop so quickly are mainly: First, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the policy of relying on the whole Party and the whole people to run meteorological undertakings was implemented, superstitions were broken, and minds were liberated, especially with the leadership of Party committees at all levels, with secretaries taking the lead, and extensively mobilizing the masses, thus rapidly setting off a high tide of large-scale meteorological undertakings across the country.

Secondly, in carrying out the work of large-scale meteorological undertakings, various places have implemented the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Generally, the principle of spending less money and doing more things was followed, and methods of mainly using indigenous methods, supplemented by foreign methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, starting from small to large, from simple to complex, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials were adopted. Yilin Township, Muling County, Heilongjiang Province, built an agricultural meteorological outpost and six meteorological groups, costing a total of only one yuan and one jiao.

Thirdly, the people's commune movement greatly promoted the development of meteorological undertakings. For example, Xuchang Special District in Henan Province listed meteorological undertakings as a task of the people's commune and proposed that with the establishment of people's communes, meteorological modernization should also be realized.

### 我国气象事业有飞跃发展  河南、广西、云南、山东、黑龙江建立气象网

    我国气象事业有飞跃发展
    河南、广西、云南、山东、黑龙江建立气象网
    据新华社6日讯　在贯彻全党全民大办气象事业的方针下，我国气象事业有了飞跃的发展。截止9月30日，根据二十二个省、自治区不完全的统计，从7月份以来已新建立了专区气象台五十三个，县气象（候）站三百二十六个，人民公社或农业社气象哨一万二千八百七十八个，气象小组十二万二千二百三十七个。河南、广西、云南、山东和黑龙江五个省（区）已实现了专区有气象台，县县有气象（候）站，乡乡（或人民公社）有气象哨，自然村或生产队有气象小组。
    各地气象组织一建立起来，就密切结合当地当时的生产需要，有效地开展气象服务工作，保证农业增产任务的实现。河南省南阳县辽河村气象哨在建立的第二天，即开始做天气预报，告诉社员这天天气晴好，社员们给棉花打了“六六六”药粉；又一天社员们准备再给棉花打药粉，气象哨告诉社员那天有雷雨，社员就没打药粉，结果下了大雨。因此群众非常拥护大办气象工作。
    气象事业所以能发展的这样快，主要是：第一，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，贯彻依靠全党全民办气象事业的方针，打破了迷信，解放了思想，特别是各级党委领导，书记挂帅，广泛地发动群众，因此，在全国迅速地掀起了大办气象事业的高潮。
    其次，各地在开展大办气象的工作上，贯彻了多快好省的建设方针。一般都是本着少花钱多办事的原则，采取了以土法为主，洋法为辅，土洋结合，从小到大，从简到繁，因地制宜，就地取材的办法。黑龙江省穆棱县伊林乡建了一个农业气象哨，六个气象小组，一共才花了一元一角钱。
    第三，人民公社化运动大大的推动了气象事业的发展。如河南省许昌专区把气象事业列为人民公社的一项任务，并提出人民公社建立起来，气象化也要实现。
