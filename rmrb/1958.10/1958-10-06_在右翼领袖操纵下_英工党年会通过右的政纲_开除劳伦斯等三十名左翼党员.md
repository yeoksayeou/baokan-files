Xinhua News Agency, Scarborough, 3rd. Our correspondent Qian Xing reports: The British Labour Party concluded its annual conference today in the seaside town of Scarborough, England. During the five-day session, the conference determined the Labour Party's future foreign policy and domestic program.

The Labour Party openly criticized the United States' Far East policy, stating that it would not participate in a war of aggression against China, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek's troops withdraw from the Chinese coastal islands and that China's legitimate rights in the United Nations be restored. However, it still disregarded China's sacred and inviolable sovereignty over Taiwan, and advocated for the United Nations to "trusteeship" China's territory of Taiwan.

The Labour Party opposed the government's plan to partition Cyprus, but did not mention the principle of self-determination to end British colonial rule on the island.

During the discussion of disarmament issues, delegate after delegate passionately demanded: the United States must not establish missile bases in Britain, and American aircraft carrying nuclear weapons must not patrol from British bases.

Many people demanded that a future Labour government should ban the use of nuclear weapons.

Those who made these demands won warm applause from the majority of the 1,300 delegates attending the conference. However, Labour leader Gaitskell tried his best to persuade the conference to reject these demands. Under the manipulation of the Labour Party's right-wing leadership, a number of comprehensive proposals reflecting the above-mentioned demands were rejected by the voting machine. These comprehensive proposals were summarized from more than 100 proposals submitted by various trade unions and local Labour Party organizations in various constituencies. What remained and was unanimously agreed by the whole party was: when the Labour Party is in power, it will stop nuclear weapons testing.

The theme of the Labour Party's economic policy adopted at the meeting—"Plan for Progress"—is to keep capitalism functioning. A planned economy based on socialist ownership was not even mentioned in this document. A motion at the meeting requesting the next Labour government to support wage demands was also rejected.

Xinhua News Agency, Scarborough, 4th. According to reports, at a secret meeting on the afternoon of September 30, the British Labour Party annual conference approved the Labour Party National Executive Committee's expulsion of thirty members, headed by John Lawrence, a member of the St. Pancras Municipal Council, who are all members of the Holborn and St. Pancras Labour Party local organizations.

The reason given by the National Executive Committee was that their "entire activities and views were considered to be contrary to the best interests of the Labour Party and completely indistinguishable from the activities and views of those known to be Communists."

Lawrence, on behalf of all the expelled members, stated the entire situation of this purge in a booklet addressed to the annual conference delegates.

The booklet listed one by one all the important work carried out by the St. Pancras City Council in the twelve months starting from May 1957. These works included constructive work in housing, slum clearance, public utilities, cultural activities, and major financial issues.

The booklet said: "We have not violated any rules of the party." The booklet also said: "Because we managed to act like socialists, we angered the Conservative newspapers, which have been shouting for action against the 'Reds of St. Pancras'."

### 在右翼领袖操纵下  英工党年会通过右的政纲  开除劳伦斯等三十名左翼党员

    在右翼领袖操纵下
    英工党年会通过右的政纲
    开除劳伦斯等三十名左翼党员
    据新华社斯卡巴罗3日电　本社记者钱行报道：英国工党今天结束了在英格兰海滨城市斯卡巴罗举行的年会。会议在为期五天的工作中确定了工党今后的外交政策和内政纲领。
    工党公开指责美国的远东政策，表明它不参加对中国的侵略战争，要求蒋介石的军队撤出中国沿海岛屿和恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。但是，它仍然无视中国对台湾神圣不可侵犯的主权，而主张由联合国“托管”中国的领土台湾。
    工党反对政府分裂塞浦路斯的计划，但是没有提到自决的原则以结束英国在这个岛上的殖民统治。
    在讨论裁军问题的过程中，代表们一个接着一个情绪激昂地要求：不许美国在英国建立导弹基地，不许带核武器的美国飞机从英国基地起飞巡逻。
    许多人要求，未来的工党政府应该禁止使用核武器。
    提出这些要求的人博得了出席会议的一千三百名代表中大多数人的热烈的掌声。但是工党领袖盖茨克尔竭力促使会议拒绝了这些要求。在工党右翼领导机构的操纵下，反映上述要求的一些综合提案都被投票机器否决了，这些综合提案是从各工会和各选区工党地方组织提出的一百多个提案归纳而成的。剩下来全党一致同意的是：当工党执政时，它将停止核武器试验。
    会议通过的工党经济政策——“争取进步的计划”的主题是使资本主义继续起作用。以社会主义所有制为基础的计划经济在这个文件里连提都没有提到。会上要求下届工党政府支持工资要求的动议也遭到否决。
    据新华社4日讯　斯卡巴罗消息：据透露，英国工党年会在9月30日下午的秘密会议上批准工党全国执行委员会开除以圣潘克拉斯市政委员会委员约翰·劳伦斯为首三十名党员，他们都是荷尔波恩和圣潘克拉斯工党地方组织的成员。
    全国执行委员会提出的理由是，他们的“整个活动和见解被认为是违反工党的最高利益的，并且同那些已经被人知道是共产党员的人的活动和见解完全无法区别”。
    劳伦斯代表全体被开除的党员在致年会代表的小册子中陈述了这次清洗的全部情况。
    小册子逐一列举了圣潘克拉斯市委员会在从1957年5月开始的十二个月中所从事的一切重要工作。这些工作包括在住房、清除贫民区、公用事业、文化活动以及主要的财政问题方面的建设性工作。
    小册子说：“我们没有破坏党的任何规则。”小册子还说：“由于我们设法像社会主义者那样地行事而激怒了保守党报纸，这些报纸一直在吼叫对‘圣潘克拉斯的赤色分子’采取行动。”
