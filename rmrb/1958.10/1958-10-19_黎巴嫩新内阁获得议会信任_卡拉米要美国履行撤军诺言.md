Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 18th: According to the Beirut "Political News", Lebanese Prime Minister Karami summoned US Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock on the 16th, drawing his attention to the US government's promise to withdraw American troops from Lebanon before the end of October this year. Karami pointed out to the US Ambassador that this promise must be fulfilled.

According to the "Alif Baa" newspaper here, Foreign Minister Oueini met with McClintock on the 17th to discuss arrangements for the withdrawal of US troops.

According to reports in today's newspapers, Lebanese President Chehab met with the leader of the National Social Party, Ashkar, on the 17th and warned him that anyone among his party members who dared to create chaos in Lebanon would be severely punished. Ashkar issued a statement two days ago declaring that his party opposed Karami's new government. This reactionary party leader, who is also a member of parliament, did not attend the parliamentary meeting on the 17th where a vote of confidence was unanimously given to Karami's government. The "Masses News" reported today that the Lebanese army, at the request of Interior Minister Edde, withdrew from the streets of Beirut starting on the 17th, allowing the police and gendarmerie to take over the task of maintaining order. The "Alif Baa" newspaper reported today that streetcars resumed operation for the first time since May this year, and all shops in Beirut also resumed business on the 17th. The newspaper reported that Edde said on the 17th that if the situation remained as it was on the 17th, he hoped that the curfew in Beirut could be lifted soon.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Karami said on the 17th that foreigners were manipulating the recent chaos and disturbances behind the scenes, but the Lebanese people had proven that they were united in responding to the government's call not to create division.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 17th: It is reported that the four-member cabinet headed by Lebanese Prime Minister Karami today won a vote of confidence in parliament. The Lebanese parliament has a total of sixty-six members. All fifty members present today voted in favor.

Karami said at the meeting that his government was determined to safeguard Lebanon's sovereignty and defend its independence, so that Lebanon remains an independent, proud, and free Arab nation. In a policy statement read to parliament before the vote, Karami said his government's primary responsibility was to consolidate national unity and gain the cooperation and trust of its citizens. Karami said his government's domestic and foreign policies would follow the policies articulated by President Chehab in his inaugural address on September 23rd. In that speech, Chehab promised to demand the early withdrawal of American troops, and expressed friendship with Arab countries and adherence to the Arab League Charter and the United Nations Charter, to restore domestic security and collect all group weapons.

According to today's newspapers here, the Lebanese National Front decided on the 16th to support Karami's new cabinet.

    据今天各报报道，黎巴嫩总统谢哈布17日同国家社会党党魁阿什卡尔会谈，并且向他提出警告说，如果他的党羽中间的任何人胆敢在黎巴嫩制造混乱，必将遭到严厉制裁。阿什卡尔在两天前发表声明，宣布他的党反对卡拉米的新政府。这个身为议员的反动党魁没有出席17日对卡拉米政府一致投信任票的议会会议。“群众报”今天报道，黎巴嫩陆军应内政部长埃迪的要求从17日起撤出贝鲁特的街道，让警察和宪兵接管维持秩序的任务。“阿利夫巴报”今天报道，从今年5月以来电车第一次恢复通行，贝鲁特所有的商店也在17日恢复营业。这家报纸报道，埃迪17日说，如果局势像17日一样的话，他希望贝鲁特的戒严很快就能取消。
    据中东通讯社报道，卡拉米在17日说，外国人在幕后操纵最近发生的混乱和骚动，但是黎巴嫩人民证明他们是团结一致地响应政府的不要制造分裂的号召。
    据新华社大马士革17日电　据报道，黎巴嫩以卡拉米总理为首的四人内阁今天获得了议会的信任票。黎巴嫩议会共有六十六名议员。今天出席的五十名议员一致投赞成票。
    卡拉米在会议上说，他的政府决心维护黎巴嫩的主权并且保卫它的独立，使黎巴嫩保持为一个独立、自豪和自由的阿拉伯国家。卡拉米在议会进行投票前宣读内阁的政策声明时说，他的政府的首要责任是巩固民族团结和获取公民的合作和信任。卡拉米说，他的政府的国内和外交政策将遵循谢哈布总统在9月23日发表的就职演说中所阐明的政策。谢哈布在那篇演说中曾经答应将要求美军早日撤退，并且表示同阿拉伯国家友好以及遵守阿拉伯联盟公约和联合国宪章，恢复国内安全并收集所有集团的武器。
    据今天这里的报纸报道，黎巴嫩民族阵线16日决定支持卡拉米的新内阁。
