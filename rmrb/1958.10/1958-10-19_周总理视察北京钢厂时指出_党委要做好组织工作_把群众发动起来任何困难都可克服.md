Xinhua News Agency, 18th - On the night of the 16th, Premier Zhou Enlai inspected work at the Beijing Steel Plant. Accompanying him were Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee; Zheng Tianxiang, Secretary of the Secretariat; and Jia Tingsan, Minister of the Ministry of Industry.

The Beijing Steel Plant's steel production for that day and night was 669 tons, doubling the previous days. Premier Zhou expressed his satisfaction with this achievement, encouraging everyone to overcome difficulties and strive to overfulfill this year's production plan.

Plant Director Wei Wenlie told the Premier that the factory's raw materials were entirely scrap iron. Premier Zhou said: Your raw materials are good, your equipment is also good, and you have the support of relevant departments of the Central Government, you should make even greater achievements.

In his report, Wei Wenlie said that the factory's small 3-cubic-meter blast furnace can now produce 7.183 tons of pig iron in one day and night. Premier Zhou said, "When I came to your factory on August 17th, the maximum output per day was only three tons. Now you have reached the advanced level in the country, which is very good."

Premier Zhou asked Plant Director Wei Wenlie: "Have you mobilized the masses in your factory? Have you held a large meeting? Has anyone from the Municipal Party Committee come to speak?" He was very pleased to learn that the factory had already held a large meeting, Jia Tingsan had also spoken at the meeting, and comrades Liu Ren, Zheng Tianxiang, Jia Tingsan and others frequently came to the factory to inspect and urge production.

When Premier Zhou learned that six engineers and forty-two technicians from the Black Metallurgy Design Institute had come to support the factory's production, he said to the plant director, "The technology is taken care of by them, the party secretary of the factory should take political command, do a good job of organizational work, and allocate personnel well. Each shift must have capable people. In this way, with politics on one side and technology on the other, your job as plant director will be easier."

Premier Zhou also said, "The difficulties of your factory are not too great. If there are no engineers, you can train them yourselves. Smelting technology is not difficult to learn. You can learn it well as long as you are bold and careful. If there are few machine tools, and the machine tools are small, you can use the method of ants gnawing on bones to make large machines." Premier Zhou cited many examples of factories working hard and frugally, illustrating that any difficulty can be overcome. He pointed out that the Party Committee should do a good job of organizational work, mobilize the masses, and prevent and eliminate accidents. He instructed the cadres from the Black Metallurgy Design Institute who came to the factory: "One person should mentor four apprentices to cultivate the factory's machine repair force."

Premier Zhou did not leave the factory until 1:30 a.m. the next morning.

After Premier Zhou left, the factory Party Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss how to increase production. The workers proposed that they must respond to Premier Zhou's concern with practical actions to increase production.

    周总理视察北京钢厂时指出
    党委要做好组织工作
    把群众发动起来任何困难都可克服
    新华社18日讯　16日夜间十一点多钟，周恩来总理到北京钢厂视察工作。陪同视察的有中共北京市委第二书记刘仁、书记处书记郑天翔、工业部部长贾庭三。
    北京钢厂这天一昼夜的钢产量是六百六十九吨，比前几天提高了一倍。周总理对这个成绩表示满意，他勉励大家克服困难，争取超额完成今年的生产计划。
    魏文烈厂长告诉总理，工厂里用的原料完全是洋铁。周总理说：你们原材料好，设备也好，再加上有中央各有关方面的支援，你们应该做出更多的成绩。
    魏文烈在汇报中说，工厂一座三立方公尺的小高炉现在一天一夜能出七点一八三吨生铁。周总理说，8月17日我到你们厂时，那时一天最多才出三吨铁，现在你们已经达到全国的先进水平了，很不错。
    周总理问魏文烈厂长：“你们厂发动群众没有？开过大会没有？市委有没有人来讲话？”当他了解到厂里已经开过大会，贾庭三还在会上讲了话，刘仁、郑天翔、贾庭三等同志经常来厂检查督促生产时，他很满意。
    当周总理了解到黑色冶金设计院有六名工程师、四十二名技术员来支援这个工厂的生产时，他对厂长说，技术由他们包了，厂里的党委书记要政治挂帅做好组织工作，把人调配好，每班都要有能手。这样，一面政治，一面技术，你这厂长就好当了。
    周总理又说，你们工厂的困难并不太大。没有工程师可以自己培养，冶炼技术并不难学，你们只要大胆、细心，就可以学好。机床少，机床小，可以用蚂蚁啃骨头的办法做大机器。周总理举了许多工厂穷干苦干的事例，说明任何困难都是可以克服的。他指出党委应当作好组织工作，把群众发动起来，防止和消灭事故。他嘱咐黑色冶金设计院来厂的干部：一个人带四个徒弟，培养工厂的机修力量。
    周总理第二天早晨一点半钟才离开工厂。
    周总理走后，工厂党委会立即开会研究如何提高生产。工人们提出，一定要用增产的实际行动来回答周总理的关怀。
