Korean Poet Bids Farewell to Comrades

    Double Circle Ring
    Jin Guilian
In the spacious courtyard, the entire village gathered, bidding farewell to the Chinese People's Volunteers like sending off their own children. Girls danced, young men sang, while the Volunteer soldiers became the guests of honor. An Ah Ma Ni (Korean for mother/aunt) walked through the crowd, looking around as if searching for someone. She tightly grasped the hand of the young soldier, Xiao Wei, handed him a small package, and whispered, "If you return to your hometown by the Songhua River and marry that smart and beautiful girl of yours, put this double circle ring on her finger. But don't ever forget your relatives in Korea!" Who could know that this tightly wrapped double circle ring was actually the Ah Ma Ni's wedding memento, which she had never worn in the dark years, and had been kept through countless hardships until now. Xiao Wei seemed to know the origin of the ring. In an instant, he was both surprised and delighted, lowering his head and saying nothing. Tears of gratitude couldn't help but flow down, engraving the Ah Ma Ni's affection deep within his heart. The Ah Ma Ni gently caressed the young man, as if sending her own son off on a long journey, gazing at the young man's lovely face, as if to recount the unforgettable years from beginning to end. This Ah Ma Ni, who had not repaid her debt of gratitude, silently pondered the past years. Children, I cannot keep you either. When will I be able to see these good sons and daughters again? Righteous friends, noble names! You came for peace and leave for peace. Although Anju, Pyongchon, and the Songhua River are far apart, our hearts will forever be connected!

专栏：朝鲜诗人送别战友

    双圈戒指
    金贵莲宽敞的庭院里聚集着全村人，像送别儿女一般欢送志愿军。姑娘们跳着，小伙子们唱着，只有志愿军战士当上了客人。穿过人群走来了一位阿妈妮，向四处望着仿佛在找什么人，她紧紧握住年青的小魏的手递过一个小包，又低声叮咛：“要是你回到松花江畔的老家跟你那聪明漂亮的姑娘结亲，就把这双圈戒指戴在她手上，可千万别忘掉在朝鲜的亲人！”谁能知道紧裹着的双圈戒指，正是阿妈妮做新娘的纪念品，在黯淡的岁月里没带过一次，经过无数艰辛一直放到如今。小魏仿佛深知这戒指的来历，一霎那间又惊又喜低头不语。感激的泪水禁不住滚滚流下，把阿妈妮情谊刻在心灵深处。阿妈妮把年青人轻轻地爱抚，仿佛要送亲生儿子走上远路，凝视着小伙子的可爱的面庞，像要把难忘的岁月从头细数。这没有报完恩功的阿妈妮心默想着逝去了的每一个寒暑，孩子们呀，我也留不住你们，啥时候才能重见这些好儿女？正义的朋友，高贵的名字呵！你们为和平而来为和平而去，安州平川和松花江虽隔遥远，我们的心永远永远连在一处！
