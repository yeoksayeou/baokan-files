    Grain Seeds with Insects Should Not Be Transferred Out
    Selecting superior grain seeds is a major measure to strive for a bumper wheat harvest in 1959. All regions are allocating grain seeds and supporting each other in the spirit of communist cooperation. However, some local grain departments, in the process of transferring seed grain, disregard the overall interest and transfer seed grain with insects to other places. For example, on September 24th, our county received 55 tons of "Yanzhou Bima No. 1" wheat seeds sent from the Third Warehouse of Luoyang City, Henan Province, and it was found that there were rice weevils in it, with an average of ten insects per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), and as many as seventy insects in severe cases, with an insect damage rate of 3%. This greatly affects the quality and germination rate of the seed grain. It is hoped that grain departments in various regions will strengthen the management of seed grain and eliminate the transfer of insect-infested grain.

    有虫的麦种不应外调
    选用优良麦种是争取1959年小麦大丰收的一大措施。各地都以共产主义的协作精神，调拨麦种，互相支援。但是有些地方的粮食部门，在调运种子粮当中不顾整体利益，有虫的种子粮也往外调。如我县在9月24日，收到由河南洛阳市三库发来兖州碧蚂一号麦种五十五吨，就发现其中有米象虫，平均每市斤有虫十头，严重的达七十余头，虫蚀率达3％。这就大大影响了麦种的质量和发芽率。希各地粮食部门加强种子粮的保管工作，并杜绝虫粮外调。
