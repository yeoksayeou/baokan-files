Xinhua News Agency, October 12th, New York (via TASS): The Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement on October 10th regarding the United States government memorandum distributed by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld concerning the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon, exposing the US plot to delay the troop withdrawal.

The US government's memorandum stated that the United States intends to complete the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon by the end of October "if no unforeseen events occur."

The Soviet delegation's statement said that the attached conditions in the US government memorandum clearly show that there are still people in the United States who have not abandoned the plan to continue the armed occupation of Lebanon. Everyone understands that, with American troops stationed in Lebanon and US officials constantly interfering in the country's internal affairs to benefit opponents of the current government, there is always the possibility of creating such "unforeseen" situations.

The statement continued that at the same time as the US government issued the above memorandum, news emerged that some American troops might remain in Lebanon after October 31st to protect "American lives and property." The colonialists' trick – first instigating unrest, then sending troops to "protect" their special envoys – is being used again.

The statement concluded that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly emergency special session on the need for the rapid withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon and British troops from Jordan must be implemented immediately. The faster this resolution is implemented, the better it will be for the cause of peace in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, October 11th: The Iraqi Republic Radio Station criticized Britain on October 10th for stepping up the arming of Israel, handing over the first of two submarines promised to Israel at Portsmouth Harbour on October 9th.

In addition, Britain also signed an agreement with Israel stipulating the provision of weapons, aircraft and military equipment worth 50 million pounds to Israel.

The radio station pointed out that equipping Israel with such a huge quantity of weapons, coupled with the US and Britain not withdrawing their troops from Lebanon and Jordan, means that the Western powers are as determined as ever to make Israel a threat to Arab countries.

It pointed out that all this is happening at a time when the US is instigating its henchmen in Lebanon to plot the overthrow of the Karami-led national government and attempting to establish a regime that is subservient to imperialism and colludes with Israel. The US is also creating excuses in an attempt not to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The radio station pointed out that this shows that the United States is attempting to collude with Israel, France, and Britain to threaten the Iraqi Republic and the United Arab Republic.

The radio station finally emphasized that Western countries should withdraw from the Middle East, hand over the Arab countries to the Arabs, and stop making Israel a tool to disrupt the security of the Middle East and threaten world peace.

    苏联出席联大代表团发表声明揭露
    美国企图拖延从黎巴嫩撤军
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：出席联合国大会的苏联代表团10日就联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德散发的美国政府关于从黎巴嫩撤出军队的备忘录发表声明，揭露美国想拖延从黎巴嫩撤军的阴谋。
    美国政府的备忘录表示，“如果不发生意外事件”，美国打算在10月底完成从黎巴嫩撤出军队的工作。
    苏联代表团的声明说，美国政府备忘录中提出的附带条件，十分明确地表明，现在美国仍然有人没有放弃美军继续武装占领黎巴嫩的计划。谁都明白，在美军驻扎黎巴嫩和美国官方人士不断干涉这个国家的内政以利于现政府的反对者的情况下，总有制造这种“意外”情况的可能性。
    声明又说，在美国政府发表上述备忘录的同时出现了这样一些消息，即在10月31日以后美国某些部队还可能留在黎巴嫩，以保护“美国人的生命和财产”。殖民主义者的伎俩——先煽起动乱，然后派遣军队“保护”他们的特使的伎俩又被应用了。
    声明最后说，联合国大会紧急特别会议关于必须迅速从黎巴嫩撤出美国军队和从约旦撤出英国军队的决议必须立即执行。这个决议执行得越快，对中近东的和平事业就越有好处。
    新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克共和国电台10日抨击英国加紧武装以色列，于10月9日在朴次茅斯港把答应给以色列的两艘潜水艇的第一艘交给了以色列。
    另外，英国还同以色列签订了一项协定，规定要给予以色列价值五千万英镑的武器、飞机和军事装备。
    这家电台指出，用这样巨大数量的武器来装备以色列，再加上美英不从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出他们的军队，这就意味着西方大国同过去一样地决心要使以色列威胁阿拉伯国家。
    它指出，这一切发生在美国指使它在黎巴嫩的走卒阴谋推翻卡拉米所领导的民族政府，并且企图建立一个听命于帝国主义、并与以色列勾结的政权的时候，美国还制造借口，企图不从黎巴嫩撤军。电台指出，这表明，美国企图同以色列、法国和英国勾结起来，威胁伊拉克共和国和阿拉伯联合共和国。
    这家电台最后强调，西方国家应该撤出中东，把阿拉伯人的国家交给阿拉伯人，停止使以色列成为扰乱中东地区的安全和威胁世界和平的工具。
