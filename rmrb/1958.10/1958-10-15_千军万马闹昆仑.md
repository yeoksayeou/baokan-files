Thousands of Soldiers and Horses Stir up the Kunlun Mountains
Li Ji

Kunlun Mountain, reaching high into the clouds,
Its peaks abound with countless treasures;
Gold, silver, copper, iron, everything is there,
Just waiting for heroes to come and claim them.

Thousands of heroes,
Marching into Kunlun with mighty force.
Setting soaring ambitions atop the mountain,
Vowing to dig out all the treasures of Kunlun.

Teams and groups,
Troops from all directions converge on Kunlun.
You ride camels, I ride horses,
Trucks lead the way, followed by donkeys.

With cadres, with farmers,
Exploration teams lead the charge.
Drilling workers erect derricks,
Drilling deep into Kunlun for thousands of feet.

Snow dances wildly, cold wind howls,
Wind and snow lash the face, freezing people to death.
But heroes fear not the millennia of snow,
Hearts burning like fire, warming Kunlun.

Tell Kunlun, don't resent us,
We have no grievances, no hatred;
Just for the sake of the motherland's industrialization,
Please hand over millions of tons of steel.

Kunlun Mountain, reaching high into the clouds,
Thousands of soldiers and horses stir up the Kunlun.
Atop the ten-thousand-foot peak, shouting to the Earth:
Look at us, six hundred million Chinese building steel!

September 23, 1958, at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains

    千军万马闹昆仑
    李季昆仑山，高入云，山高宝多数不尽；金银铜铁样样有，单等英雄好汉们。千万个，英雄们，浩浩荡荡进昆仑。山顶立下冲天志，誓把昆仑宝挖尽。一队队，一群群，各路兵马会昆仑。你骑骆驼我骑马，汽车开路毛驴跟。有干部，有农民，勘探队员打头阵。钻探工人搭井架，钻透昆仑万丈深。雪乱舞，寒风紧，风雪扑面冻死人。英雄不怕千年雪，心热似火暖昆仑。叫昆仑，莫怨恨，咱们无冤又无恨；只为祖国工业化，请你交出钢铁千万吨。昆仑山，高入云，千军万马闹昆仑。万丈山顶对着地球喊：看我们六亿钢铁的中国人！
  1958年9月23日于昆仑山麓
