Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, made a statement regarding Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots, saying: We fully support Minister Peng Dehuai of our National Defense Ministry's letter to Taiwan compatriots on October 6th. The letter suggests holding negotiations and implementing a peaceful resolution; this fully demonstrates the mainland compatriots' deep concern for the military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei, and also points out the only way out for the military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei.

American imperialism is the common enemy of all Chinese people. For several years, it has been occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, trampling on the military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei; it also attempts to create so-called "two Chinas" to realize its long-term occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan. This is intolerable to every Chinese person. The military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei are all Chinese. Are you willing to sacrifice yourselves for the Americans instead of jointly driving out the American invaders and safeguarding the sovereignty, security, and world peace of the motherland?

In the new world situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, it is not only shameful but also a dead end to fantasize about relying on American imperialism and eking out a meager existence on the islands of Taiwan, because American imperialism is not only a paper tiger but also a ruthless wolf. It is neither reliable nor can it be relied upon. We hope that the military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mawei will not miss the opportunity, accept Minister Peng Dehuai's suggestion in time, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible to jointly build a prosperous and happy new China with the people of the whole country.

    中国致公党主席陈其尤说
    祖国为台湾军民指明出路
    新华社7日讯　中国致公党主席陈其尤就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话说：我们完全拥护我国国防部彭德怀部长10月6日告台湾同胞书。书中建议举行谈判，实行和平解决；这充分表现出大陆同胞对台、澎、金、马军民同胞的深切关怀，也为台、澎、金、马军民同胞指出了唯一的出路。
    美帝国主义是我们全中国人民的公敌、几年来一直侵占我国领土台湾，蹂躏台、澎、金、马的军民同胞；还企图制造所谓两个中国以实现其长期侵占我国领土台湾的阴谋。这是每一个中国人所不能容忍的。台、澎、金、马的军民同胞都是中国人，难道你们甘愿为美国人牺牲自己而不共同起来赶走美国侵略者，保卫祖国的主权、安全和全世界的和平吗？
    在东风压倒西风的世界新形势下，幻想依靠美帝国主义，借台湾各岛屿苟延残喘，不仅是可耻的而且只有死路一条，因为美帝国主义不但是纸老虎，而且也是个狠心狼，它既不可靠也不能靠的。我们希望台、澎、金、马的军民同胞，勿失良机，及时接受彭德怀部长的建议，早日回到祖国的怀抱，同全国人民一道共同建设繁荣幸福的新中国。
