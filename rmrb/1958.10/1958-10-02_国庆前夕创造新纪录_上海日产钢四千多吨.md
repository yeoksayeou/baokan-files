New Records Created on the Eve of National Day
Shanghai's Daily Steel Output Exceeds Four Thousand Tons
Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 1st October. On September 30th, the day before National Day, the Shanghai steel front created an unprecedented record of producing more than 4,400 tons of steel per day. This figure represents a 71% increase compared to the 29th, and 120.8% higher than the average daily output of the previous twenty-nine days of this month.

On this day, red flags were fluttering everywhere in Shanghai's steel plants, gongs and drums were sounding, the steelmaking furnaces were bustling with activity, and molten steel was flowing everywhere. All major steelmaking workshops in the city achieved record production. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which holds the national red flag for high open-hearth furnace production, produced thirteen heats of steel from its two open-hearth furnaces throughout the day, five more heats than on the 29th, reaching a new peak utilization coefficient of 22.2. The open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, which has recently set new records for rapid steelmaking, closely followed the red flag of the open-hearth furnace of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and set a new record of smelting a heat of steel in three hours and forty-seven minutes at noon on the 30th. The utilization coefficient of the open-hearth furnace reached 22.4 on this day. The electric furnace section of Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory, which has completed the state plan for thirty consecutive months, completed the state plan for September ahead of schedule on the 28th. On the 30th, the first and second shifts of this factory produced sixteen heats of rapid steelmaking (two furnaces), and the smelting time per heat was shortened by more than half an hour on average compared to the previous month.

The five large and medium-sized converter workshops that were newly built and expanded throughout the city exerted tremendous power on the 30th, and the new converters in these workshops produced about 1,000 tons of steel. Dozens of small converters, indigenous open-hearth furnaces, and small electric furnaces in non-metallurgical systems such as textile factories, shipyards, machine factories, and schools also joined the battle.

The materials supply and transportation departments also worked intensively to ensure that the steelmaking furnaces did not lack raw materials. In one day and night on the 29th, the automobile team of the Transportation Bureau alone transported more than 27,000 tons of steel raw materials, more than 10,000 tons more than usual. Many cadres, students, and family members of workers participated in voluntary labor, pushing material carts and carrying coke in the factory.

Singers and actors from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Theatre Academy, and Shanghai Film Studio took turns performing in the factories today, and the workshops were filled with songs from morning till night. Many teachers and students of the Conservatory of Music improvised new songs in the steelmaking workshops, praising the soaring enthusiasm of the steelworkers.

    钢铁“卫星”齐放　国庆“礼花”纷飞
    国庆前夕创造新纪录
    上海日产钢四千多吨
    新华社上海1日电　国庆节的前一天——9月30日，上海钢铁战线上创造了日产四千四百多吨钢的空前纪录。这个数字比29日增长了71％，比这个月前二十九天的平均日产量高出120.8％。
    这一天，上海各炼钢厂里到处红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，炼钢炉旁人声鼎沸，钢水奔流，全市主要炼钢车间都出现了丰产纪录。高举全国平炉高产红旗的上钢三厂两座平炉，全天炼出了十三炉钢，比29日多出五炉，利用系数达到二十二点二的新高峰。最近几天连创快速炼钢新纪录的上钢一厂平炉车间，紧追在上钢三厂平炉红旗的后面，30日中午又创三小时四十七分炼一炉钢的更高纪录，这天的平炉利用系数达到了二十二点四。连续三十个月完成国家计划的上海机修总厂电炉工段，28日提前完成了9月份国家计划。30日，这个厂的第一、第二两班连出十六炉（二个炉子）快速炼钢，冶炼时间炉炉比上个月平均缩短半小时以上。
    全市新建和扩建完工的五个大型和中型转炉车间，30日发挥了巨大的威力，这批车间的新转炉共炼出了约一千吨钢。非冶金系统的纺织厂、造船厂、机器厂以及学校等单位，也有几十个小转炉、土平炉和小电炉投入战斗。
    物资供应、交通运输部门也紧张调度，保证炼钢炉不缺原料。29日一昼夜间，单是交通运输局汽车一场就输送了二万七千多吨钢铁原料，比平时多运一万多吨。很多机关干部、学生、职工家属参加义务劳动，到场里推料车、扛焦炭。
    上海音乐学院、上海戏剧学院和上海电影制片公司的歌唱家、演员们今天都轮番到场作慰问演出，从早到晚车间里歌声不息。音乐学院很多师生在炼钢车间即席编出新歌，歌颂炼钢工人的冲天干劲。
