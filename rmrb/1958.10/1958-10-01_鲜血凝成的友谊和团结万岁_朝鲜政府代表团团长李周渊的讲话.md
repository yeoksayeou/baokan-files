Dear Vice Chairman Zhu De,
Dear Comrades and Friends:

I am extremely excited and honored to be able to attend the inaugural meeting of the China-Korea Friendship Association, which signifies the further consolidation and development of the friendly unity between our two peoples, and I warmly congratulate the nine fraternal associations that were born today at the same time as the China-Korea Friendship Association.

Korea and China are close neighbors bordering each other. Since ancient times, we have maintained friendly relations and have had extensive cultural exchanges, giving each other positive influence in the development of national cultures. Moreover, in the past common struggle against the common enemy of Japanese imperialism, especially during the Korean people's war of liberation against American imperialism, the friendship and solidarity between the two peoples has been further consolidated and developed. During the most difficult period of the Korean War, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, not only provided us with material and spiritual assistance, but also sent the Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to help us with blood. They fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, repelled the invasion of the sixteen-nation allied forces led by American imperialism, which boasted of being the strongest in the world, and forced them to sign the armistice agreement. In the post-war construction period, the fraternal Chinese people again gave the Korean people tremendous material and spiritual assistance. Recently, the government delegations of Korea and China held talks on economic cooperation, which further promoted the development of economic cooperation between Korea and China, and the material assistance that the Chinese government decided to give to the Korean government is the equipment that the Korean people urgently need to build socialism in their country. This will be a great encouragement to the Korean people's cause of peaceful reunification of their motherland.

This friendly and cooperative relationship between the Korean and Chinese peoples is being strengthened and developed day by day. I firmly believe that the China-Korea Friendship Association, established here today, will inspire the peoples of Korea and China to strive for even greater achievements in further developing the long-standing friendly unity and cooperative relationship between them.

The strengthening and development of the friendly solidarity and cooperation between the Korean and Chinese peoples will make a great contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East and will be a heavy blow to the war provocations of the imperialists.

The Korean people have pointed out that the American imperialists' armed provocations not only in the southern half of our country, but also in the Taiwan Strait region today, are a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world, and resolutely condemn its so-called "ceasefire" conspiracy. If American imperialism disregards the powerful force of the great 600 million Chinese people and continues its stupid war provocations, then without a doubt, it will suffer a disastrous defeat and be destroyed in the flames of war.

At a time when the friendship and unity between the Korean people and the Chinese people is developing to a new and higher stage, the entire Korean people, in order to further consolidate the friendly relationship with the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, has decided to conduct a month-long national activity, the Korea-China Friendship Month, centered on the National Day of the great Chinese people and the anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into Korea.

During this period, rich and colorful commemorative activities will be organized and carried out in every corner of Korea. The Volunteers' Memorial Tower will soon be completed, and the Korea-China Friendship Association will also be established soon.

Finally, on this significant day, I would like to convey the deep gratitude of the Korean people to the Chinese people for organizing the China-Korea Friendship Association, and at the same time wish all fraternal countries organized between the friendly associations to achieve greater success in their work in the future.

Long live the friendship and unity cemented in blood between the peoples of Korea and China!
Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the peoples of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China headed by Chairman Mao Zedong!
Long live the great Chinese people who have launched a great leap forward in socialist construction!

### 鲜血凝成的友谊和团结万岁  朝鲜政府代表团团长李周渊的讲话

    鲜血凝成的友谊和团结万岁
    朝鲜政府代表团团长李周渊的讲话亲爱的朱德副主席同志亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我能够参加意味着我们两国人民的友好团结进一步巩固和标志着它的进一步发展的中朝友好协会成立大会，感到无比兴奋和光荣，并热烈祝贺今天和中朝友好协会在同一时刻诞生的九个兄弟协会。
    朝中两国人民是国境毗连的近邻，自古以来就一直保持着友好关系，并且有着广泛的文化交流，在发展民族文化方面互相给予了积极的影响。不仅如此，在过去抗击仇敌日本帝国主义的共同斗争中，特别是在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的祖国解放战争时期，两国人民的友谊和团结更加得到了巩固和发展。在朝鲜战争最艰苦的时期，中国人民高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，不仅从物质上和精神上援助了我们，而且派遣了由自己优秀的儿女组成的志愿军，用鲜血援助了我们。他们同朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打退了自己吹嘘为世界最强的以美帝国主义为首的十六国联合武装的进犯，迫使它们不得不在停战协定上签字。在战后建设时期，兄弟的中国人民又从物质上和精神上给予了朝鲜人民巨大的援助。最近，朝鲜政府代表团和中华人民共和国政府代表团举行了有关经济合作的会谈，进一步促进了朝中两国经济合作的发展，而中国政府所决定给予朝鲜政府的物质帮助则是朝鲜人民建设祖国社会主义极其需要的设备。这对于朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的事业，将会成为巨大的鼓舞。
    朝中人民之间的这种友好合作关系正在日益加强和发展。我深信，今天在这里成立的中朝友好协会，在进一步发展朝中人民久已存在的友好团结和合作关系方面，将鼓舞朝中两国人民争取更辉煌的成就。
    朝中两国人民的友好团结和合作的加强与发展，将会对维护远东和平作出巨大的贡献，并沉重地打击帝国主义者的战争挑衅。
    朝鲜人民曾经指出，美帝国主义不仅在我们祖国南半部，而且今天在台湾海峡地区所进行的武装挑衅行为，是对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁，并且坚决痛斥它的所谓“停火”的阴谋。如果美帝国主义悍然不顾伟大六亿中国人民的强大力量，继续其愚蠢的战争挑衅，那么毫无疑问，一定会遭到惨败，毁灭在战火之中。
    在朝鲜人民和中国人民的友谊和团结发展到新的、更高的阶段的时候，全体朝鲜人民为了进一步巩固同中国人民和中国人民志愿军的友好关系，决定以伟大中国人民的国庆节和志愿军赴朝作战纪念日为中心，进行一个月的全国性活动——朝中友好月。
    这期间，朝鲜的每一个角落，都要组织和开展丰富多采的纪念活动。志愿军追慕塔即将落成，朝中友好协会也即将成立。
    最后，值此意义重大的日子，我谨转达朝鲜人民对组织中朝友好协会的中国人民的深切谢意，同时预祝各兄弟国家之间组织的友好协会，今后在自己的工作中获得更大的成就。
    朝中两国人民鲜血结成的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国万岁！
    掀起社会主义建设大跃进运动的伟大中国人民万岁！
