Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, October 21st. Nazim Majdalani, leader of the Lebanese National Front and member of parliament, said today that the Lebanese people have opposed U.S. military intervention from the very beginning. Lebanese independence was not threatened before the U.S. occupation.

Majdalani pointed out during an exclusive interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the U.S. has claimed to have "changed" its policies towards Arab countries. "The U.S. has said this many times, but unfortunately, until now, we still haven't felt any change."

When asked about his opinion of the current four-member cabinet, the Greek Orthodox member of parliament believed that the current cabinet would only last for a short period and would inevitably be reorganized. He hoped that after the situation stabilized, those who blindly followed Chamoun would wake up, and Lebanon would "return to the traditional policies since 1943: not participating in military treaties and treating all countries equally in the spirit of friendship."

He pointed out: "Lebanon must remove Chamoun's followers and other fifth columnists who work for imperialism from all government institutions. We must dissolve the parliament that does not represent the will of the people in the near future."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 21st. According to the Middle East News Agency, the Lebanese parliament re-elected Oueidat as speaker on the 21st. Oueidat received thirty-one votes, and his opponent, Sabri Hamadeh, the candidate of the National Front, lost by five votes.

This is the third consecutive time that Oueidat has been elected as speaker.

It is said that the Free National Party, headed by Chamoun, had differing opinions during the voting, with some members voting for Oueidat and others voting for Hamadeh.

The news agency also said that Mounir Abu Fadel, a supporter of Chamoun, was elected as deputy speaker. He received thirty-two votes, and his opponent, Adib Ferzli of the National Front, received nineteen votes. Fadel served as a police officer during the British Mandate in Palestine and cooperated with the British intelligence services there. After the British ceased their mandate, he left Palestine for Lebanon. He has been elected as a member of parliament several times in Lebanon. This is the first time he has been elected as deputy speaker.

Oueidat delivered a speech after being elected. He expressed his hope that he could promote cooperation between the parliament and the government. He praised President Chehab's attitude, saying: "Chehab recognizes Lebanon's urgent needs, such as restoring normalcy and collecting civilian weapons, so that Lebanon can fulfill its responsibility as an independent and neutral country."

    黎民族阵线领袖马吉达兰尼说
    美国占领威胁黎巴嫩独立
    奥塞兰重新当选黎巴嫩议会议长
    新华社贝鲁特21日电　黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖、议会议员纳齐姆·马吉达兰尼今天说，黎巴嫩人民从一开始就反对美国进行军事干涉。在美国进行占领之前，黎巴嫩的独立并没有受到威胁。
    马吉达兰尼在单独接见新华社记者时指出，美国所谓已经“改变”了对阿拉伯国家的政策，“这种话美国已经谈过多少次了，但是不幸，一直到现在，我们仍然没有感到有什么改变。”
    谈到他对目前的四人内阁的估计时，这位希腊正教徒议员认为，目前的内阁将只维持一个短暂期间，势必改组。他希望在局势平稳以后，那些盲目追随夏蒙的人会醒悟过来，黎巴嫩将“恢复到1943年以来的传统政策：不参加军事条约，本着友爱精神一视同仁地对待一切国家。”
    他指出：“黎巴嫩必须从一切政府机构中清除夏蒙分子以及其他为帝国主义工作的第五纵队分子。我们必须在最近将来解散不代表人民意志的议会。”
    新华社大马士革21日电　据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩议会在21日重新选出奥塞兰为议长。奥塞兰得三十一票，他的对手、民族阵线的候选人萨布里·哈马德以五票之差落选。
    这是奥塞兰连续第三次当选议长。
    据说，以夏蒙为首的自由国民党在投票时意见不一致，有些党员投票赞成奥塞兰，另外一些党员投票赞成哈马德。
    这家通讯社又说，夏蒙的支持者、穆尼·阿布·法德勒当选为副议长。他得三十二票，他的对手、民族阵线的阿迪卜费泽利得十九票。法德勒在巴勒斯坦英国托管时期曾担任警官，并且同那里的英国情报处进行合作。在英国停止托管以后，他离开巴勒斯坦到黎巴嫩。他在黎巴嫩几次当选为议员。他当选为副议长还是第一次。
    奥塞兰在当选后发表演说。他表示希望能够促使议会和政府之间进行合作。他赞扬谢哈布总统的态度说：“谢哈布认识到黎巴嫩的迫切需要，例如恢复正常状态和收集民间的武器，以便使黎巴嫩能够履行它作为一个享有独立的中立国家的责任。”
