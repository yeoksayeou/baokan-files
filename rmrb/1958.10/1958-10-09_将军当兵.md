Generals serving as soldiers is unprecedented. In the People's Liberation Army, across all service branches and military regions, a communist wind of "generals becoming soldiers in the companies" has sprung up among the vast numbers of officers, including commanders of military regions. This is a glorious tradition of the people's army, and also a fine aspect of so-called "guerrilla habits."

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's own army. In past revolutionary wars, it promoted the glorious tradition of unity between the military and the people, unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, sharing weal and woe, thereby achieving invincibility and winning the great victory of the people's revolution. However, after the victory of the revolution, some people considered this glorious tradition to be "guerrilla habits" and not "formal." Now, in the great era of "one day equaling twenty years," as we accelerate the building of socialism and prepare to gradually transition to communism, we should not only not discard this "guerrilla habit" of glorious tradition, but, on the contrary, should continue to highly promote it.

Generals going down to the companies to serve as soldiers will, under the new conditions, certainly further improve the leadership thinking and leadership style of the officers in the various units; further deepen the intimate relationship between officers and soldiers, superiors and subordinates; and surely bring about leaps and bounds in the work of each company and each service branch, thereby adapting to the new era and accelerating the building of a modern, regular army. It can be expected that our people's own army will play an even greater role as a fighting force, a production force, and a political work force, creating labor miracles in socialist construction, establishing merits in killing the enemy while resisting aggression and defending the motherland, and setting a shining example of excellent qualities and noble style for the future transition to communism.

    将军当兵
    将军当兵，史无前例。中国人民解放军各兵种、各军区部队的广大军官、包括军区司令员，兴起了“到连队当兵去”的共产主义之风；这是人民子弟兵的光荣传统，也是所谓“游击习气”的优良风气。
    中国人民解放军是人民子弟兵，在过去历次革命战争中都发扬了军民一致、官兵一致、上下一致、同甘苦共患难的光荣传统，从而所向无敌，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。但是，这种光荣传统，在革命胜利以后，也曾经被一些人认为是“游击习气”，不“正规”。现在，在加速建成社会主义并准备逐步向共产主义过渡的“一天等于二十年”的伟大年代里，不仅不应丢弃这种光荣传统的“游击习气”，而且，相反地，应当继续高度发扬。
    将军下连队当兵，必将在新的条件下，使各部队军官的领导思想、领导作风进一步得到改进；军官关系、上下关系进一步亲密无间；各连队、各兵种的各项工作必将飞跃进展，从而适应新的时代，加速建成现代化的常备军。可以预期，我们的人民子弟兵必将更大地发挥战斗队、生产队、政治工作队的巨大作用，在社会主义建设中创造劳动奇迹，在抗御侵略捍卫祖国中建立杀敌功勋，在为将来过渡到共产主义树起优良品质、高尚风格的光辉榜样。
