The Inspiring "Daughter of the Party"
	Shi Lianxing

"Daughter of the Party" is an excellent film. The glorious deeds of the revolutionary martyrs it reflects can not only educate the younger generation, but also, at a time when the US imperialists are instigating the Chiang Kai-shek clique to launch military provocations against us, will redouble our hatred for the enemy and urge us to repel the invaders with greater determination.

The background of "Daughter of the Party" is the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi. Since the Red Army went north to resist Japan, the reactionaries have carried out inhumane devastation against the people here. Villages were looted, houses were burned down, chickens, dogs, cattle, and sheep were slaughtered... However, even in this time of the most severe white terror, the Communist Party members, guerrillas, military dependents, and those who wholeheartedly followed the Party remained closely united and fought the enemy indomitably! "Daughter of the Party" portrays these moving facts, praises those heroic fighters who fought for freedom and liberation, and quite successfully portrays the image of a Communist Party member like Li Yumei.

Li Yumei is the daughter of a poor peasant and a strong Communist Party member. She escaped from the enemy's artillery fire and went to find the Party again. In the process of finding the Party, she was obstructed by the traitor Ma Jiahui, causing misunderstanding among her comrades, but she was not discouraged. She won the trust of her comrades with her actions, organized them, established a Party group, and continued to work for the Party. Finally, because of Ma Jiahui's betrayal, she fell into the hands of the enemy and died heroically. When she was being taken to the execution ground by the enemy, she held her head high, her eyes flashing with hatred. She was unyielding to the death, with her heart set on the Party. Many places in the film vividly express this Communist Party member's loyalty and unyielding character. For example, when Li Yumei saw Ma Jiahui, although her situation was so dangerous, she put her personal safety aside and righteously denounced the traitor. Also, when she used the Party dues contributed by her comrades and herself to buy pickles, preparing to send them to the guerrillas on the mountain who lacked salt, she resolutely refused to let her beloved daughter Xiaoniu grab some to eat. Although these are details, we can clearly see the brilliance shining from her. Comrade Tian Hua, who played Li Yumei, vividly shaped this image, and her acting skills are simple and realistic, without any traces of carving. The film also depicts several other Party members with different personalities, such as the branch secretary, Xiuying, Huizhen, etc., and also portrays some images of the masses, such as Xiuying's grandfather, the children's corps member Tusong, etc. Although they are not given much attention, they also left a good impression on the audience.

The shortcomings of the film are that the conflicts are not fully developed, the entire plot seems relatively thin, and some of the characters and events still lack authenticity and credibility. For example, for the role of Ma Jiahui's wife, Guiying, is the author trying to make people sympathize with her or hate her? It is very unclear. She is a traitor, who betrayed her comrades along with Ma Jiahui, and her hands are stained with the blood of her comrades, but when Yumei looked for Ma Jiahui, Guiying confessed to Yumei, and later rescued Yumei, making the audience forgive her and sympathize with her situation. This way of handling this character will undoubtedly weaken the film's ideology. When the three female Party members went to Dongshan to find the guerrillas, the enemy cavalry had just passed by, and they picked up a pair of worn-out straw sandals worn by the guerrillas and shouted in unison, "Guerrillas!" As a result, they called the enemy back to search. This plot is also not true. The actual situation was that at that time, the mountains and fields were full of either the enemy's large forces or the enemy's "communist eradication corps," and at that time, it was impossible for the Red Army guerrillas to have such cavalry. As long as they heard the cavalry, they could determine that it was the enemy. The local people all knew this situation, so how could they shout for the guerrillas in unison? In addition, the film contains too many shots of children crying and the corpses of martyrs being hanged, which makes the tone tend to be tragic and low, which is inconsistent with the heroic historical facts of the entire film.

    激动人心的“党的女儿”
    石联星
    “党的女儿”是一部优秀的影片。它所反映的革命先烈的光辉事迹，不仅可以教育青年一代，而在美帝国主义指使蒋介石集团向我们进行军事挑衅的今天，也将加倍激起我们对敌人的仇恨，促使我们以更大的决心去反击侵略者。
    “党的女儿”的背景是江西老革命根据地。自从红军北上抗日以后，反动派对这里的人民进行了惨无人道的摧残。村庄被洗劫一空，房屋被焚烧了，鸡犬牛羊被宰杀了……然而就在这白色恐怖最严重的时刻，共产党员们、游击队员们、军属们和一心跟着党走的人们，仍然紧密地团结在一起，不屈不挠地跟敌人斗争！“党的女儿”表现了这些可歌可泣的事实，歌颂了那些争取自由解放的英勇的斗士，而且相当成功地刻划了像李玉梅那样的共产党员的形象。
    李玉梅是一个贫农的女儿，一个坚强的共产党员。她从敌人的炮火下死里逃生跑了出来，重新去找党。在找党的过程中，她受到叛徒马家辉的阻挠，引起了同志们的误解，但是她没有灰心。她用自己的行动取得了同志们的信任，把同志们组织起来，成立了党小组，继续为党工作。最后，因为马家辉的出卖，她落到敌人手里，英勇牺牲了。在被敌人绑赴刑场时，她昂着头，眼睛里闪射着仇恨的火光，她至死不屈，一心向党。影片中好多地方都鲜明地表现了这个共产党员的忠贞不屈的性格。例如李玉梅见到马家辉的时候，虽然她的处境那么危险，然而她却把个人生死置之度外，义正辞严地斥责叛徒；又如她将同志们和自己交的党费买成咸菜，准备送给山上缺盐吃的游击队时，她最心爱的女儿小妞要抓点来吃，她也坚决不许。这些虽然是细节，但是从中我们也可以清晰地看到从她身上闪射出来的光辉。扮演李玉梅的田华同志生动地塑造了这个形象，她的演技朴素真实，没有雕琢的痕迹。影片还描绘了其它几个不同性格的党员，如支部书记、秀英、惠珍等，也刻划了一些群众的形象，如秀英爷爷、儿童团员土松等。他们虽然着墨不多，但也给观众留下了很好的印象。
    影片的不足之处，是矛盾没有充分展开，整个故事情节看来比较单薄，其中有些人物和事件也还缺乏真实可信性。如马家辉的妻子桂英这个角色，作者是想使人同情还是想使人憎恨呢，就很不明确。她是个叛徒，与马家辉一起出卖了同志，她的手上是沾有同志们的鲜血的，但当玉梅找马家辉时，桂英却向玉梅忏悔，后来又救出玉梅，使得观众原谅她同情她的处境。这样来处理这个人物，无疑会削弱影片的思想性。三位女党员到东山找游击队时，敌人马队刚过，她们拾到了一双游击队员穿过的破草鞋就齐声高喊：“游击队”，结果把敌人又喊回来搜索，这一情节也不真实。实际情况是当时满山遍野不是敌人的大部队就是敌人的“铲共团”，而且当时红军游击队不可能有这样的马队，只要听到马队就可断定是敌人，当地群众都知道这种情况，她们怎么会齐声喊游击队呢？此外，影片中过多出现孩子哭啼和烈士尸体被吊着的镜头，也使得调子趋于悲怆低沉，和整个影片的壮烈史实不相一致。
