    No More Xs for Bookkeeping
    A little team member, returning home,
    Helps mother learn to read.
    A left stroke, a right slash,
    Grandma recognizes Arabic numerals.
    1 looks like chalk,
    2 looks like a duck,
    3 looks like an ear,
    4 looks like a plow,
    5 looks like a weighing hook,
    6 looks like a bean sprout,
    7 looks like a sickle,
    8 looks like twisted dough,
    9 looks like a rice scoop,
    0 looks like a watermelon.
    Learning the numerals makes me happy,
    No more Xs for bookkeeping.

    记账不再划××
    小队员，回了家，
    帮助妈妈学文化。
    左一撇，右一划，
    大娘认识洋字码。
    1字像粉笔，
    2字像只鸭，
    3字像耳朵，
    4字像犁铧，
    5字像秤钩，
    6字像豆芽，
    7字像镰刀，
    8字像麻花，
    9字像饭勺，
    0字像西瓜。
    学会字码心高兴，
    记账不再划××。
