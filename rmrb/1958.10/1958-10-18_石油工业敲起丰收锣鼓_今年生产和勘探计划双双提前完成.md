Xinhua News Agency, October 17th: China's petroleum industry has achieved a double bumper harvest in production and exploration. The state's crude oil production plan for this year has been completed eighty-eight days ahead of schedule. As of the end of September, the national petroleum exploration drilling footage reached over 800,000 meters, also completing the annual state plan three months ahead of schedule.

The two major harvests in the petroleum industry are the result of implementing the general line for socialist construction. This year, after clarifying the policy of simultaneously focusing on deep and shallow oil layers, developing both large and small oilfields, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and drilling more wells to find more oil and gas fields in a faster, better, and more economical way, the petroleum exploration workers unleashed soaring enthusiasm. They vigorously engaged in the technical innovation movement, proposing hundreds of thousands of rationalization proposals to save money, conserve equipment, and improve operating methods. In recent months, the national average monthly drilling footage per rig has increased by one to two times compared to last year. Last year, no drilling rig in the country could advance 1,000 meters per month, but this year in September, there were ninety-two drilling teams that advanced 1,000 meters per month. The Wang Jinxi Drilling Team of Yumen even created a national record of 5,009 meters per month. This record is rare even in the world. These facts indicate that China's drilling speed has stepped into the world's advanced ranks.

Crude oil production has implemented the policy of simultaneously focusing on natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum, developing both large, medium, and small oil plants (fields), and combining indigenous and foreign methods to enable large and small petroleum enterprises to rapidly blossom and bear fruit across the country. This year, not only have new petroleum bases been added and the recoverable reserves of crude oil expanded, but more than 1,000 small-scale synthetic petroleum factories have also been newly built throughout the country. This year, Nong'an County in Jilin Province alone has established more than 100 shale oil plants.

Currently, twenty-seven provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country have petroleum factories.

    石油工业敲起丰收锣鼓
    今年生产和勘探计划双双提前完成
    据新华社17日讯　我国石油工业生产和勘探双双丰收。今年国家的原油生产计划已提前八十八天完成；全国石油勘探钻井进尺到9月底已达八十多万公尺，也提前三个月完成了全年的国家计划。
    石油工业的两大丰收，是贯彻社会主义建设总路线的结果。今年，石油勘探的职工们，明确了深浅油层齐抓，大小油田并举，土洋办法结合，多打井，多找油气田的多快好省方针以后，发挥了冲天干劲。他们大闹技术革新运动，提出数十万件节省钱、节省设备、改进操作方法的合理化建议。最近数月，全国平均每部钻机月进尺数比去年提高了一倍到两倍以上。去年，全国没有一个钻机能月进千公尺的，而今年9月份月进千公尺的井队就有九十二个。玉门王进喜钻井队更创造了月进五千零九公尺的全国最高纪录。这个纪录在世界上也是少有的。这些情况表明，我国钻井速度已跨进世界先进行列。
    原油生产贯彻了天然石油和人造石油并举，大、中、小油厂（田）并举，土洋办法结合的全民办石油的方针，使大小石油企业迅速地在全国各地开花结果。今年不仅增加了新的石油基地，扩大了原油可采储量，全国各地还新建了一千多个小型人造石油工厂。吉林省农安县一个县今年以来就建立了一百多个页岩油厂。
    现在，全国已有二十七个省、自治区、市有了石油工厂。
