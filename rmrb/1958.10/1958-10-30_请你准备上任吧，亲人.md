Please Prepare to Take Office, Dear Ones
    Lǚ Yuǎn
    One. Eight years ago, you left your home, like a valiant knight mounting his saddle. You drank a mouthful of Yalu River water and stepped into the battle of Korea. You and the People's Army joined forces, becoming a single iron fist. The iron fist was simply waved, snapping the flagpole of imperialism. Even a three-year-old child in Africa knows why the Americans knelt to negotiate at the 38th parallel.
    Two. Today, you are back, brothers! You have returned, stepping on the radiant sunshine of the motherland, singing songs of triumph. You have returned. Eight years is not long; the children in the village have just finished elementary school. But brothers, do you know how many years the motherland has leaped forward?

    You can take a car across the Qilian Mountains to see the oil fields of Tarim; you can take a domestically produced plane to smell the fragrant smoke spewing from the ubiquitous blast furnaces. If not, come with me to see the abundant orchards on our East Mountain, come with me to see the small hydroelectric power station on the river west of our village, and then look at the land of our commune—a single furrow twelve li long—and then look at the main road in front of our village, which is fully three zhang wide.
    Three. For eight years, you guarded the gate of peace abroad. Under your protection, the motherland has marched forward with great strides. The enemy has been defeated, and you have returned. The motherland is celebrating with gongs and drums to welcome loved ones. Look, brothers, the motherland has prepared the best posts for you: the steelmaking furnaces in the bountiful fields, and the front line in Fujian—the artillery is aimed directly at the enemy. Please prepare to take office! Greater victories are waiting for you!
