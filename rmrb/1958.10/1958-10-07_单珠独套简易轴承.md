    Single Ball Single Race Simple Bearing
    Workers at the Yichuan County Machinery Manufacturing and Repair Plant in Henan Province have recently successfully trial-produced a single ball single race simple bearing. After testing, the effect is good, and the pulling force can be reduced by more than half, making it suitable for rural use.
    This simple bearing is easy to manufacture and does not waste materials. Any agricultural cooperative with drilling and filing tools can manufacture it. Previously, making a set of ball bearings for a large cart required 23 jin of iron and 12 workdays, with each set costing more than 30 yuan. Making a set of single ball single race simple bearings only requires 2 jin of iron and 2 workdays, with each set costing about 5 yuan. Each modification saves 10 workdays and 21 jin of iron compared to before. Yichuan County has 12,000 large carts. If all of them are equipped with simple bearings, it can save the country 252,000 jin of steel and 120,000 workdays, and greatly accelerate the speed of bearingization.

    单珠独套简易轴承
    河南伊川县机械制造修配厂的职工，最近试制成功单珠独套简易轴承，经过试验，效果良好，拉力可减轻一半以上，适合农村使用。
    这种简易轴承制造简单，又不废材料，凡是有钻锉两种工具的农业社都可制造。以前做一套大车的滚珠轴承，需要铁二十三斤、工十二个，每套价值在三十元以上；做单珠独套简易轴承一套，只需要铁二斤，工两个，每套价值五元左右，每改一辆比以前节省十个工，二十一斤铁，伊川县有大车一万二千辆，全部安上简易轴承可给国家节约钢铁二十五万二千斤，节省人工十二万个，并可大大提前运转轴承化速度。
