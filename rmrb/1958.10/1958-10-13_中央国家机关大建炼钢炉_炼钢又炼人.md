Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Central government organs have launched a mass campaign to make steel. Today is the second day of steel production for various units, and the output has increased sixfold compared to yesterday.

Under the slogan "Fight for Steel," the broad masses of workers and staff in various units are in high spirits, and many leading cadres are personally taking action. The State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and the State Technology Commission are jointly refining steel, with leading cadres working alongside the masses, lighting the furnace on the same day it was built. Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng participated in on-site work. The Ministry of Internal Affairs worked hard through the night and quickly produced two batches of steel. The masses of the Ministry of Public Security are full of energy, and it only took six hours from repairing the furnace to producing steel. The first batch produced 47 kilograms of steel, which was tested to be medium carbon steel. The Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways worked hard and produced 300 kilograms of steel yesterday.

To solve the shortage of raw materials, the staff of various units are both contributing ideas and actively taking action. The Ministry of Geology relied on everyone to donate iron, and quickly collected more than 18 tons of iron. The First Ministry of Machine Building cleared out its warehouse overnight and picked out 10 tons of scrap iron.

All units regard the mass steelmaking movement as a good way to train people. In order to enable more people to participate in this vigorous movement, many units are constantly expanding their plans. On the basis of building a steel furnace, the Ministry of Geology will also build a coking furnace. After it is put into production, it is estimated that the daily output of coke can reach more than 40 tons. The Ministry of Chemical Industry already has fifteen crucibles lit, and plans to build three more 114-kilogram small converters.

In order to help various units learn steelmaking technology, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has sent a large number of personnel to various units to provide on-site guidance, disseminate technology, and exchange experiences.

    中央国家机关大建炼钢炉
    炼钢又炼人
    新华社11日讯　中央国家机关各单位掀起了群众性的炼钢热潮。今天是各单位炼钢出钢的第二天，产量比昨天猛增六倍。
    在“为钢而战”的口号下，各单位广大职工斗志昂扬，许多领导干部亲自出马。国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会、国家技术委员会联合炼钢，领导干部同群众一起劳动，当日建炉点火。教育部部长杨秀峰参加现场工作。内务部通宵苦战，很快炼出了两炉钢。公安部群众干劲冲天，从修炉到出钢只用了六小时，第一炉就出了四十七公斤钢，经化验是中炭钢。铁道部铁道科学院经过苦战，昨天一天出钢达三百公斤。
    各单位职工为了解决原料不足，一面献策献计，一面积极行动。地质部依靠大家献铁，很快收集到十八吨多铁。第一机械工业部连夜清理仓库，拣出废铁十吨。
    各单位都把群众炼钢运动看作是锻炼人的好方法。为了能使更多的人参加到这个轰轰烈烈的运动中来，许多单位的计划都在不断扩大。地质部在建成炼钢炉的基础上，还要修建炼焦炉，投入生产以后，估计日产焦炭可以达到四十多吨。化工部已经有十五个坩锅点了火，还准备再建三个一百一十四公斤的小转炉。
    为了帮助各单位学习炼钢技术，冶金工业部派出大批人员到各单位去进行现场指导，传播技术，交流经验。
