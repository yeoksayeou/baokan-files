As the Chiang Kai-shek clique introduced US warships for escort, our Ministry of National Defense issued an order at 3 p.m. on October 20, announcing that the order of October 13 regarding the cessation of shelling of Jinmen was invalid, and shelling must be resumed. Serving themselves right – this is the deserved punishment for the recent actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Our Ministry of National Defense clearly announced in its order of October 13: "American personnel are not allowed to escort ships in the Jinmen sea area. If there is an escort, fire immediately." However, on October 19 and 20, three US dock landing ships and destroyers successively invaded our Jinmen sea area to escort Chiang's troops for as long as five hours. Since Chiang's troops dared to violate the order of our Ministry of National Defense, and our army always keeps its word, they will of course be severely punished without leniency. Our Ministry of National Defense has long announced that the supply problem of Jinmen should be solved by the Chinese themselves, and it is not right to bring wolves into the house and ask the Americans for escort. Now that Chiang's troops have violated the conditions for the suspension of shelling and insist on seeking support from the United States, let them see what benefits they get from introducing US warships for escort!

Half a month ago, people had hoped that the Taiwan authorities would value peace and patriotism, and that the Chinese issue would be resolved by the Chinese themselves; however, since our army suspended the shelling, the Taiwan authorities have not made any corresponding gestures, refusing peace talks and showing no remorse. On the contrary, the Chiang Kai-shek clique clamored loudly, saying that "our efforts to recover the mainland will be successful," and "the time is not far away, definitely not years later." They described our army's suspension of shelling as their "victory." It seems that the Taiwan authorities still have great hopes for the Americans. Although Dulles and his ilk, in order to shirk responsibility, once scolded Chiang Kai-shek for being foolish in stationing heavy troops in Jinmen and Matsu, and believed that relying solely on the Chiang Kai-shek clique's own strength would not allow them to return to the mainland, which made the Taiwan authorities very annoyed and resentful; however, due to the Americans' repeated appeasement and the actual acceleration of the supply of a large number of weapons, including eight-inch howitzers, F100 jet aircraft, "Walker Bulldog" tanks, "Sidewinder" missiles, and the decision to give Chiang's troops "Nike-Hercules" missiles, the Chiang Kai-shek clique once again became arrogant. This time, the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles, according to the US State Department and the Taiwan authorities, aimed to jointly discuss the military situation of defending Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and to further implement the US-Chiang treaty. Regarding the stubbornness and frenzy of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, as the order of our Ministry of National Defense said, "This is tolerable, but what is not?"

A series of facts in the past two weeks show that the United States and the Taiwan authorities are playing a double act. On one hand, Dulles and his ilk play the role of the good guy, repeatedly declaring to the world and its allies that the United States wants to reduce Chiang's troops in Jinmen and Matsu, reduce the extra combat troops that the United States has additionally increased to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and that the United States is putting pressure on Taiwan to carry out "persuasion." Look, what a "conciliatory" and "flexible" policy, what a great "new transformation"!

However, on the other hand, the Taiwan authorities come out to play the role of the bad guy, shouting and objecting. After the "New York Times" published an editorial on the 16th advocating that Chiang's troops withdraw from Jinmen and Matsu, Chiang Kai-shek and Jiang Yisheng, the spokesman of the Taiwan "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," issued statements saying, "We hope to emphasize again the importance of Jinmen as a barrier to the entire US position in the Western Pacific," and "if we withdraw from these islands under pressure," then "the hope of counterattacking the mainland will be shattered." Transferring Chiang's troops from Jinmen and Matsu from the coastal islands back to Taiwan "will have a very bad impact on morale, and doing so will have extremely unfavorable consequences. People will ask: If the United States asks us to do this, then won't they also abandon us in defending Taiwan?"

People can't help but ask: Whose words count, the Americans' or the Taiwanese'?

If we compare it with other situations, the problem becomes even clearer. Eisenhower and Dulles have repeatedly stated that they have not put any pressure on the Taiwan authorities, "We have no plans to ask him to do this at all." And the Taiwan authorities have also repeatedly stated that "no American official has ever raised" this issue; "not even a shadow of such a suggestion"; "I cannot believe that any responsible American official has such an idea." In this case, what other explanation can there be for the "conciliatory" gestures made by Dulles and his ilk, other than to deceive world public opinion!

Dulles is not clever, and the double act he directed is very clumsy. What is more thorough in exposing this double act than Dulles's talk on October 14th? He said: Even if the Taiwan authorities agree, "we do not approve of handing these islands over to the Chinese Communists." Regarding Dulles's speech, the British "Times" said: Dulles "expressed many different opinions at different times," and "he has obviously retreated from his position two weeks ago." However, if anyone thinks that the "double act" directed by Dulles has come to an end, it is too early. "Dulles's visit to Taiwan" is being unveiled amidst the sound of gongs and drums. People can predict that no matter how hard Dulles tries, he cannot conceal the United States' hostility towards the Chinese people, its continued interference in China's internal affairs, its occupation of Taiwan, and its ambition to expand its aggression against China. The Chinese people will never allow the United States to interfere in China's civil war, and the Chinese people will surely recover Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu entirely and complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. This great determination of the Chinese people cannot be changed by any aggressive force, even if the entire US army, navy, and air force are transferred to the Taiwan Strait, nor can it be shaken by any American conspiracies and tricks. All the aggressive plans of Dulles and his ilk will only continue to suffer shameful failures.

We advocate that the Chinese people solve their own problems. The sound of artillery fire on the Fujian front should make the Taiwan side more sober. We still have hopes for a peaceful resolution. If the Chiang Kai-shek clique stubbornly refuses peace talks and blindly obeys the orders of the Americans, then they cannot blame us for taking all necessary measures.

### 咎由自取

    咎由自取
    由于蒋介石集团引进美舰护航，我国防部在10月20日下午三时发布命令，宣布10月13日的关于停止炮击金门的命令无效，必须恢复炮击。咎由自取，这是蒋介石集团最近所作所为的应得的惩罚。
    我国防部10月13日的命令中，明明白白宣布：“金门海域，美国人不得护航。如有护航，立即开炮。”可是，10月19日和20日，竟先后有美国船坞登陆舰和驱逐舰三艘侵入我金门海域为蒋军护航，达五小时之久。蒋军敢于违犯我国防部命令，我军言出法随，当然严惩不贷。我国防部早已宣布，金门的供应问题，应由中国人自己解决，不应该引狼入室、要美国人护航。现在，蒋军既然破坏了暂停炮击的条件，硬要找美国做靠山，那么，就让他们看看引进美舰护航究竟对他们有什么益处！
    半个月以前，人们曾希望台湾当局能以和为贵，以爱国为重，中国的问题由中国人自己解决；可是，在我军暂停炮击以来，台湾当局并无任何相应的表示，拒绝和谈，毫无悔悟之意。相反的，蒋介石集团大肆叫嚣，说什么“我们收复大陆的努力将会成功”，“已为时不远，肯定不会是几年以后的事情”，他们把我军暂停炮击说成是他们的“胜利”。看来，台湾当局对于美国人还抱有颇大的希望。虽然杜勒斯之流为了推卸责任，曾经责骂蒋介石把重兵驻在金马为愚蠢，并且认为只靠蒋介石集团自己的力量是不会回到大陆上去的，使得台湾当局甚为恼火，怨愤交加；但是，由于美国人的百般安抚，又实际上加紧供应了大量武器，其中有八英寸口径的榴弹炮，F100喷气飞机，“瓦克恶犬”式坦克，“响尾蛇”式导弹，并且决定给蒋军“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹，这样，蒋介石集团就又翘起尾巴来了。这次蒋介石和杜勒斯会谈，据美国国务院和台湾当局宣布，目的是共商防卫台、澎、金、马的军机，进一步实施美蒋条约。对于蒋介石集团这样的顽固和猖狂，正如我国防部命令中所说的，“是可忍，孰不可忍”。
    两周以来的一系列的事实表明，美国和台湾当局在扮演双簧。一面是杜勒斯之流扮红脸，一再向全世界和它的盟国表白：美国要减少金马蒋军，减少美国额外增加到台湾和台湾海峡的额外战斗部队，美国正在向台湾施加压力，进行“说服”。看啊，这是多么“和解”和“灵活”的政策呀，这是多么大的“新转变”呀！
    可是，另一方面，台湾当局出来扮白脸，大叫大嚷反对。“纽约时报”16日发表主张蒋军撤出金马的社论以后，蒋介石和台湾“外交部”发言人江易生发表谈话说，“我们希望再次强调金门作为整个西太平洋美国阵地的屏障的重要性”，“如果我们在压力下撤出这些岛屿”，那末，“反攻大陆的希望将告幻灭”，把蒋军从金马从沿海岛屿调回台湾，“对于士气会产生极坏的影响，这样做会产生极其不利的影响。人们会问：如果美国会要我们这样做，那末他们在防卫台湾这个问题上不会也撒手不管我们吗？”
    人们不免要问：究竟是美国人说的话算数，还是台湾方面说的话算数呢？
    如果再对照一下其它的情况，问题就更加清楚了。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯一再声明说，没有对台湾当局施加过什么压力，“我们一点也没有要求他这样做的计划”。而台湾当局也一再声明说，“没有一个美国官员曾经提出过”这个问题；“连这样一个建议的影子都没有”；“我不能相信任何负责的美国官员有这种想法。”如此看来，杜勒斯之流所作的“和解”姿态，除了为的是欺骗世界舆论以外，还能作什么别的解释呢！
    杜勒斯并不高明，他所导演的双簧是很别脚的。拆穿这一出双簧的，还有比杜勒斯10月14日的谈话更透底的吗？他说：即使台湾当局同意，“我们不赞成把这些岛屿交给中国共产党人”。对于杜勒斯的这次谈话，英国“泰晤士报”说：杜勒斯“在不同的时刻讲了许多不同的意见”，“他显然是从两星期前的立场倒退”了。不过，如果谁以为杜勒斯导演的“双簧”就此告终，那还嫌过早。“杜勒斯访台”的一场，正在锣鼓声中揭幕。人们可以预断，不管杜勒斯怎么卖力，也掩盖不了美国敌视中国人民、继续干涉中国内政、霸占台湾、扩大对中国侵略的野心。中国人民决不会允许美国插手中国的内战，中国人民一定要整个地收复台、澎、金、马，完成祖国统一的大业。中国人民这种伟大的决心，是任何侵略武力，即使把美国全部海陆空军调到台湾海峡上来，也改变不了，也是任何美国的阴谋诡计所动摇不了的。杜勒斯之流的一切侵略计划，只会继续遭到可耻的失败。
    我们主张中国人的事由中国人自己解决。福建前线的炮声，应该使台湾方面清醒一些。我们对于和平解决仍是寄予希望的。如果蒋介石集团顽固拒绝和谈，一味唯美国人之命是从，那就不能怪我们采取一切必要的措施了。
