Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: At the grand banquet held tonight to welcome the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his gratitude to the triumphant Chinese People's Volunteers with great excitement and fervent emotion. The Premier said that our Volunteers have all withdrawn from Korea, but the American aggressor troops are still赖 [lai, to depend on, to hang around] hanging around in South Korea and赖 hanging around in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. He said that since we have the power to defeat American imperialism at Shangganling, then if the United States dares to provoke a new war, it will surely suffer even more disastrous defeat!

The Premier's speech aroused bursts of stormy and frenzied applause from soldiers, workers, farmers and representatives from all walks of life attending the banquet.

Tonight's banquet was jointly held by six units to welcome the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The six units are: the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, and the Beijing Branch of the Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

More than 1,000 people attended tonight's banquet. Party and state leaders and representatives from all walks of life in the capital, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students and merchants, gathered with the Volunteer representatives, warmly greeting each other and joyfully recounting the great victory on the Korean battlefield eight years ago and the great achievements of national construction.

At 7:00 p.m., Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo and others accompanied General Yang Yong, commander of the Volunteers, and General Wang Ping, political commissar of the Volunteers, into the banquet hall. At this time, the audience applauded enthusiastically to welcome them.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Ambassador Li Yong-ho, and the heads of the units hosting the banquet, including Bao Erhan, Liao Chengzhi, Wan Li, Wu Han, and Zhang Xiruo, accompanied the Volunteer combat heroes Wang Huyuan, Huang Zhifu, Wang Zhanshan, Lu Changrong, Zhao Jihua, as well as some model workers in industry and agriculture in the capital, sitting at the five tables in the front, drinking wine together without restraint and talking cordially.

At tonight's banquet, people toasted victory with uncontainable excitement. Steelworkers attending the banquet, farmers from people's communes in the suburbs, soldiers from the Beijing Military Region, militiamen, and students went to the seats of Generals Yang Yong and Wang Ping in groups to toast the returning heroes. The Volunteer combat heroes also toasted Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo. At each table, bursts of laughter rang out constantly, and people singing could not help but dance. Over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the motherland, the Chinese People's Volunteers have worked hard with the Korean people for the cause of peace. Tonight, people toasted and toasted the heroes with heartfelt gratitude. An old farmer, aged 63, from the "August 1st" People's Commune in Huairou County said to a Volunteer comrade, "Our farmers have made a great leap forward and achieved a bumper harvest. We don't need money to eat, and there are no poor farmers anywhere. We must thank the Volunteer comrades for this happy life. It is you who have used your blood to protect our happiness." The mood of this old farmer is the mood of the people of the whole country.

Guo Moruo emphasized:
We fully support the Korean government's statement firmly demanding that the US troops get out of South Korea

Guo Moruo first made a speech at the meeting with full enthusiasm, welcoming and congratulating the Chinese People's Volunteers who had established immortal merits and completed the tasks entrusted to them by the people of the motherland, returning to the embrace of the motherland. In his speech, Guo Moruo emphasized that we fully support the statement issued by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on October 28 regarding the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and that, like our firm demand that the US aggressor troops withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, we resolutely demand that the US aggressor troops and the troops of other puppet countries get out of South Korea.

Guo Moruo spoke in an extremely excited tone about the great historical significance of the Volunteers' departure abroad. He said that the Chinese and Korean people defeated the US aggressor troops and exposed the US paper tiger. This not only defended the independence of Korea and ensured the security of the motherland, but also encouraged the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to fight for national independence and against colonialism and imperialism, thereby safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

Guo Moruo finally said that during the eight years of the Volunteers in Korea, the people of the whole country took you as a model and called you the most beloved people. You have inspired the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country and promoted the development of the motherland's construction. Now, you—the most beloved people—are all back. The people of the whole country are welcoming you and hope that you will always be the most beloved people, under the leadership of the Party and under the brilliant light of the general line of building socialism, together with the people of the whole country, just like defeating US imperialism in Korea, defeat the earth, defeat nature, and bring the glorious achievements of Shangganling to all fronts of the motherland's construction.

Yang Yong expressed the Volunteers' determination:
Devote even greater energy than at Shangganling
Join the new battle to build and defend the motherland

General Yang Yong expressed his deep gratitude in his speech. He said that in the short two days since we arrived in the capital, we have deeply felt the loving care and warmth of the motherland for its children, and that in the midst of the national great leap forward, we have been welcomed on such a large scale. This afternoon, our great leader Chairman Mao personally received us and gave us extremely cordial guidance. All the comrades in the delegation felt that this was the greatest happiness in their lives and the glory bestowed on all the Volunteer comrades by Chairman Mao.

At the banquet, Yang Yong expressed the determination of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers. He said that in the future, we will start from scratch as primary school students on the construction front, spur ourselves on, humbly learn from the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the motherland, and, together with the people of the whole country, devote even greater energy than at Shangganling to the new struggle to build and defend the motherland. Yang Yong said that for the early victory of the great communist cause in our country, we will not hesitate to contribute all our strength.

Korean Ambassador to China Li Yong-ho extended the best wishes to the Chinese people and the Volunteers in his speech. He said, "I extend my heartfelt thanks and high honor to all the heroic Volunteer officers and soldiers who aided the Korean people with their blood in our most difficult times, and wish you greater achievements in your future work."

Ambassador Li Yong-ho also congratulated the further consolidation of the friendship and solidarity between Korea and China, which was solidified with blood, and congratulated the Korean and Chinese people on their great victory in the struggle to strive for the integrity of their motherland's territory and to crush the war provocation conspiracy of US imperialism.

Liao Chengzhi, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Bao Erhan, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Wu Han, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC, and Zhang Xiruo, chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, also made impromptu toasts one after another, warmly congratulating the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in defeating US aggressor troops, and sincerely thanking the Volunteers for their great contribution to the great struggle to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

The wife of Korean Ambassador to China Li Yong-ho also toasted at the banquet. She said that during the arduous struggle of the Korean people to fight against US imperialist aggression, she thanked the mothers and wives of the Volunteers for sending out their loved ones to aid the Korean people's struggle against aggression with their blood. She warmly wished the mothers and wives of the Volunteers good health.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet. He said: "The Chinese People's Volunteers have been to Korea for a full eight years. You have successfully completed the tasks assigned to you by the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. On behalf of the people of the whole country, our Party, the government, and Chairman Mao, I thank you. Our battle is not over yet, US imperialism is still provoking us, and our battle must continue."

"Our Volunteers have all withdrawn from Korea, but US aggressor troops are still hanging around in South Korea and hanging around in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The people of China and Korea and the people of the world will never allow them to赖 [lai, to depend on, to hang around]hang around there."

"US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, but the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people has proved that it is only a paper tiger. Since we have the power to defeat the invading troops of US imperialism at Shangganling, then if the United States dares to provoke a new war of aggression, it will surely suffer an even more disastrous defeat."

"The reason why we are so happy and so jubilant at today's banquet is by no means accidental. This is because the spirit of Resisting US Aggression and Aid Korea has inspired us. Today's banquet of more than 1,000 people represents the feelings of the 650 million people of the whole country. We must always learn from the example of the Volunteers. We must combine the spirit of Resisting US Aggression and Aid Korea, the spirit of the Volunteers, with the spirit of everyone being a soldier, and greatly accelerate the great leap forward in our country's socialist construction."

The Premier finally said: "Today is the new era of the 20th century, the era of the people. Under the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, we must contribute all our strength and fight to the end for the cause of world peace and human progress."

Vice Chairman Zhu De then said: "The victory of the Chinese and Korean people against US aggression is also a victory for the people of the world. The Chinese people will surely be able to repel any provocation by US imperialism and build a communist society at an early date. Building communism is everyone's greatest happiness and highest happiness. You have already established great merits, and I hope you will continue to work hard in the future."

The speeches of Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai aroused bursts of stormy applause and frenzied cheers from the audience.

Also present at tonight's banquet were Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, Yang Chengwu, Zhang Aiping, Gan Siqi, Xiao Hua and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the heads of various departments of state organs, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and Party and government organs and people's organizations in Beijing.

After the banquet, a grand dance was held. The Party and state leaders and representatives from all walks of life in the capital who attended the banquet rejoiced with the most beloved people until late at night. (Attached picture)

  今天一千多人的宴会，代表着全国六亿五千万人民的感情。我们要永远学习志愿军的榜样。我们要把抗美援朝的精神，志愿军的精神，同全民皆兵的精神结合起来，大大加快我国社会主义建设的大跃进。
    新华社29日讯　在今晚举行的欢迎中国人民志愿军代表团的盛大宴会上，周恩来总理怀着极大的兴奋和激昂的感情向凯旋归来的中国人民志愿军表示感谢。总理说，我们的志愿军全部从朝鲜撤回来了，但是，美国侵略军至今还赖在南朝鲜，赖在台湾和台湾海峡。他说，我们既然有力量在上甘岭把美帝国主义打败，那么，如果美国敢于挑起新的战争，它就一定会遭到更惨重的失败！
    总理的讲话激起了出席宴会的士兵、工人、农民及各界代表一阵阵暴风雨般的狂热的掌声。
    今晚的宴会是由六个单位为欢迎中国人民志愿军代表团而联合举行的，六单位是：全国人大常委会、政协全国委员会、中国人民抗美援朝总会、北京市人民委员会、市政协、市抗美援朝分会。

    郭沫若强调说：我们完全支持朝鲜政府声明坚决要求美军滚出南朝鲜
    郭沫若怀着满腔热情首先在会上致词，欢迎和祝贺建立了不朽功劳，完成了祖国人民委托的中国人民志愿军，回到祖国的怀抱。郭沫若在讲话中强调说，我们完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在10月28日发出的关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的声明，和我们坚决要求美国侵略军从台湾和台湾海峡撤出一样，我们坚决要美国侵略军和其它仆从国家的军队从南朝鲜滚出去。
    郭沫若以极为兴奋的语调讲述了志愿军出国的伟大历史意义。他说，中朝人民打败了美国侵略军，戳穿了美国纸老虎，这不仅保卫了朝鲜的独立，保证了祖国的安全，而且鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立斗争、反对殖民主义和帝国主义的斗争，从而保卫了亚洲和世界的和平。
    郭沫若最后说，志愿军在朝鲜的八年期间，全国人民都以你们为模范，称你们是最可爱的人，你们鼓舞了全国人民的热情，促进了祖国建设事业的发展。现在，你们——最可爱的人都回来了，全国人民都在欢迎你们，并且希望你们永远做最可爱的人，在党的领导下，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，同全国人民一起，如同在朝鲜打败美帝国主义那样，打败地球，打败自然，把上甘岭的辉煌战绩带到祖国建设的各个战线上去。
    杨勇表示志愿军的决心：
    拿出比上甘岭更大的劲头
    投入建设和保卫祖国新战斗
    杨勇上将在讲话中表示了深切的感激之情，他说，我们来到首都在短短的两天中，深深感到祖国对自己儿女慈母般的抚爱和温暖，在全民大跃进的百忙中，还这样大规模地来欢迎我们。今天下午，伟大的领袖毛主席又亲自接见了我们，给我们作了异常亲切的教导，代表团所有同志都觉得这是自己一生中最大的幸福，是毛主席给予所有志愿军同志的光荣。
    杨勇在宴会上代表志愿军指战员表示决心说，今后我们要在建设战线上从头当一个小学生，鞭策自己，虚心学习祖国人民冲天的干劲，同全国人民一起，拿出比上甘岭更大的劲头来，投入建设祖国、保卫祖国的新的斗争中去。杨勇说，为了伟大的共产主义事业在我国早日胜利，我们将毫不犹豫地贡献出自己的一切力量。

    “我们的志愿军全部从朝鲜撤回来了，但是，美国侵略军至今还赖在南朝鲜，赖在台湾和台湾海峡。我们中朝两国人民和全世界人民决不容许他们赖在那里。
    “美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，但是，中朝人民的伟大胜利已经证明它不过是一只纸老虎。我们既然有力量在上甘岭把美帝国主义的侵略军打败，那么，如果美国敢于挑起新的侵略战争，它就一定会遭到更惨重的失败。
    “我们在今天的宴会上所以如此高兴，如此欢欣鼓舞，这决不是偶然的。这是因为抗美援朝的精神鼓舞了我们。今天一千多人的宴会，代表着全国六亿五千万人民的感情。我们要永远学习志愿军的榜样。我们要把抗美援朝的精神，志愿军的精神，同全民皆兵的精神结合起来，大大加快我国社会主义建设的大跃进。”
    总理最后说：“今天是二十世纪的新时代，是人民的时代。在马列主义光辉的照耀下，在毛泽东同志的领导下，我们要贡献出我们的全部力量，为世界和平和人类进步的事业而奋斗到底。”
    朱德副主席接着讲话说：中朝两国人民反对美国侵略的胜利也是全世界人民的胜利。中国人民一定能够击退美帝国主义的任何挑衅，早日建设起共产主义的社会。建设起共产主义，这是大家最大的快乐，最高的幸福。你们已经建立了很大的功勋，希望你们今后继续努力。
