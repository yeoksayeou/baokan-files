    Unity Road
    On the Guanshan Ridge in the Liupan Mountains, there is a 27-kilometer-long winding road. This is the Longjing Highway, built jointly by the Hui and Han people of Longde and Jingyuan counties, conquering the Guanshan Mountains. The local Hui and Han people call it "Unity Road."
    The Liupan Mountains lie between these two counties. East of the mountains is Jingyuan County, where the Hui people live, and west of the mountains is Longde County, which is predominantly Han. Although they are neighboring counties, there was little contact between the Hui and Han people due to the obstruction of Guanshan. More than a year ago, the people of the two counties proposed to jointly build this highway. They jointly organized a construction organization and a construction team of more than 4,000 people to survey and stake out the line on Guanshan Ridge, and then began construction in two sections, east and west. At that time, the Hui laborers in Jingyuan County lacked road-building tools, so Longde County supported them with a large number of road-building tools, and after completing their own engineering tasks ahead of schedule, they took the initiative to go to the section undertaken by the Hui laborers in Jingyuan County to help build the road. This winding road with a total of 290 large and small bends and 17 large and small bridges and culverts was completed in just over a month.
    After the highway was opened to traffic, the exchanges between the Hui and Han people in the two counties became closer day by day. This year, Jingyuan County has sent cadres to Longde County many times to learn about soil and water conservation experience. Longde County also went to Jingyuan to collect tree seeds and transport coal along this road. During the autumn sowing season, Jingyuan County lacked improved wheat varieties, so Longde County supported the Hui people of Jingyuan with hundreds of thousands of kilograms of Ukrainian improved wheat varieties for sowing.

    团结路
    在六盘山脉的关山岭上，有一条二十七公里长的盘旋公路，这是隆德、泾源两县的回汉族人民共同征服关山山岭，修通的隆泾公路，当地回汉族人民把它叫做“团结路”。
    六盘山横亘在这两县之间，山以东是回族人民聚居的泾源县，山以西是汉族占绝大多数的隆德县，虽为邻县，但因关山隔阻，回汉人民来往很少。一年多以前，两县人民提出共同兴修这条公路。他们共同组织了施工机构和四千多人的施工队伍，到关山岭上勘测、定线，然后分东西两段施工。当时泾源县回族民工缺少筑路工具，隆德县就用大批筑路工具支援他们，并在提前完成自己担负的工程任务后，主动到泾源县回族民工担负的工段，帮助修路。这条共有二百九十个大小弯道、十七个大小桥涵的盘山公路，只用一个多月就修通了。
    公路通车以后，两县的回汉人民交往一天比一天密切。今年泾源县曾多次派干部到隆德县学习水土保持经验。隆德县也到泾源采集树种，并通过这条路拉运煤炭。秋种时，泾源县缺少小麦良种，隆德县就把几十万斤乌克兰良种小麦，支援泾源回族人民播种。（附图片）
