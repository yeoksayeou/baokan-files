On the morning of October 10th, the sea off Fuqing Bay was dotted with white sails, and fishermen were sailing their boats to fish. Along the coast, people were strengthening field management in the rice paddies, where the rice was flowering and heading. The young men and women engaged in steel production worked in shifts, one after another, laboring selflessly... At this time, the sound of airplanes grew closer and closer. It turned out to be six F-86 type American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, hiding in the clouds more than 10,000 meters high, carrying out harassing activities. The people on the frontline of coastal defense, who had been tempered for a long time, glared angrily, and there was a burst of angry curses. In the blink of an eye, our air force plane formation swept across the sky. The angry curses immediately turned into cheers and jubilation in all directions. Then "dong, dong, dong," a series of fierce artillery battles came from the south of Dongyong Mountain near Haikou.

Hundreds of militia members of the Haikou People's Commune, who were already "everyone a soldier," shouted: "Go grab prisoners!" They picked up rifles, Mauser pistols, machine guns, and submachine guns, and rushed to the seaside, the mountains, and the fields. The militia from the villages and towns around Haikou Town also surged up, and the militia from Changle County, forty miles away, also came from all directions, over mountains and ridges, weapons in hand, hearing the sound. In an instant, the sky and the ground within a hundred miles formed a great encirclement circle to annihilate enemy planes and capture prisoners.

Along with the artillery fire, three Chiang Kai-shek planes lost their lives, dragging flames, and plunging down from the clouds. At this time, a white parachute slowly descended. People rushed up with guns, hoes, and stones. The sound of capturing prisoners was everywhere. Chen Jinhua, a veteran who had fought fiercely against the Chiang Kai-shek army in the Liberation War and fought against the American wolves in Korea, holding a rifle, and several militiamen, took the lead. In a sweet potato field south of Dongyong Mountain, they first approached the Chiang Kai-shek pilot who was untying his parachute straps and trying to escape. "Don't move, treat prisoners leniently..." Chen Jinhua skillfully ordered the Chiang Kai-shek pilot to raise his hands and surrender, just like he captured prisoners in the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. This Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Fifth Brigade Twenty-seventh Squadron Second Lieutenant pilot, Zhang Naijun, raised his hands, trembling, and said: "I am Chinese, Chinese..." He obediently surrendered. The Haikou Commune Militia Rescue Team bandaged the wounds on his neck and palms, which were broken during the parachute jump, and sent him to the rear.

The broad masses of militiamen and the masses then went to the top and foot of Dongyong Mountain to put out the flames of the burning wreckage of the Chiang Kai-shek plane. While putting out the fire, everyone proudly talked around the wreckage of the enemy plane: We have a heroic air force in the sky, a heroic navy on the sea, an invincible army on land, and incredibly powerful militia in every village and commune. Wherever the enemy comes from, we will annihilate them there.

    喜看空战，勇捉俘虏
    新华社记者　刘葵华
    10日清晨七时，福清湾海面，白帆点点，渔民们正在驾船捕鱼。沿岸人民正在扬花吐穗的稻田里，加强田间管理。进行钢铁生产的男女青年，一班下来，一班又上去，在忘我地劳动着……。这时候，飞机轰轰声越来越近，原来是六架F—86型美制蒋机，钻在白云密布的一万多公尺高空，进行袭扰活动。久经锻炼的海防前线人民，个个怒目而视，一片怒骂声。一转眼，我空军机群掠空而来。四野里由怒骂立即转为一片雀跃欢腾。接着“咚咚咚”，从海口附近东?山南面，就传来一阵阵猛烈的炮战声。
      “全民皆兵”了的海口人民公社几百名基干民兵，高喊着：“抓俘虏去！”拿起步枪、驳壳枪、机关枪、冲锋枪，向海边、山头、田野奔去。海口镇周围各个村镇的民兵也蜂涌而起，四十里外的长乐县民兵也手执武器，翻山越岭地从四面八方闻声赶来。倾刻间，纵横百里内的天空和地面形成了一个歼敌机、抓俘虏的大围歼圈。
    随着炮声，三架蒋机丧了命，拖着大火，从白云中栽了下来。这时，一顶白色降落伞，徐徐下降。人们端着枪支、锄头和石块蜂涌而上，满山遍野到处是捉俘虏的声音。曾在解放战争中痛歼过蒋军，在朝鲜打击过美国狼的转业军人陈金华，手提步枪，和几个民兵，一马当先，在东?山南的一块地瓜田里，首先逼近了正在解降落伞带、想逃跑的蒋军飞行员。“不准动，宽待俘虏……”陈金华像在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中抓俘虏一样，熟练地命令蒋军飞行员举手投降。这个蒋空军五大队二十七中队少尉飞行员张乃军，高举着双手，战战兢兢地说：“我是中国人、中国人……”乖乖地就擒了。海口公社民兵救护队，把他颈部和手掌跳伞时碰破的伤口扎好，送往后方。
    广大民兵和群众然后又分头奔往东?山顶和山脚，扑灭着了火的蒋机残骸。大家一边灭火，一面围着敌机残骸，骄傲地欢谈着：我们天上有英勇的空军，海上有英勇的海军，陆上有战无不胜的陆军，乡乡社社有强大无比的民兵，敌人从哪里来，就把它消灭在哪里。
