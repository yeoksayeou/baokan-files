    Resolutely Eliminate the Poisonous Weeds of Anti-Sovietism and Anti-Socialism
    Soviet Writers' Union Expels Pasternak
    Pasternak's novel "Doctor Zhivago" seriously distorts reality and is a blatantly anti-Soviet and anti-artistic work. After being criticized, he actually sent the manuscript abroad for publication, becoming a propaganda tool for the Western bourgeoisie in carrying out the Cold War. The Western bourgeoisie awarded Pasternak the Nobel Prize not because he was a poet or writer, but because he was a slanderer.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 28th: The Soviet "Literary Gazette" reported today that on the 27th, the Soviet Writers' Union passed a resolution expelling Boris Pasternak, the author of the novel "Doctor Zhivago," which viciously slanders the socialist revolution, the Soviet people, and Soviet intellectuals, from the Soviet Writers' Union.
    According to Soviet press reports, Doctor Zhivago in Pasternak's novel is an intellectual of the old Russian bourgeoisie, a philistine with base emotions and vulgar thoughts. The revolution prevented him from living according to "convention," he longed for the old bourgeois system, and he hated the revolution and the new system. However, Pasternak portrayed this doctor, who insisted on individualism and ultimately rolled onto a reactionary stance, as an "outstanding" representative of the old Russian intelligentsia. He used maliciously distorted reality to depict a picture of the "destruction" of Russian intellectuals in the new society through Doctor Zhivago. In September 1956, the Soviet "New World" magazine refused to publish this obviously anti-Soviet and anti-artistic work, and wrote a long rejection letter to Pasternak, providing a detailed critical analysis of the novel. But he embarked on a path that tarnished the noble title of Soviet writer, sending the manuscript of this novel abroad to be published by those who openly opposed socialism. As soon as the novel was published, it was welcomed by the Western bourgeoisie, and reactionary newspapers launched anti-Soviet clamor around it. The Swedish Academy, acting on the will of the big bourgeoisie, awarded this year's Nobel Prize for Literature on October 23 to the author of this novel, which has no literary value.
    The decision of the Soviet Writers' Union was unanimously adopted at a joint meeting of the Presidium of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, the Executive Bureau of the Organizing Committee of the Writers' Union of the Russian Federation, and the Presidium of the Committee of the Moscow Branch of the Writers' Union. The decision emphasized that Pasternak's actions are incompatible with the title of Soviet writer and are hostile to Russian literary traditions, the people, peace, and socialism. Pasternak began by advocating "pure art" and ultimately became a bourgeois propaganda tool, a profitable object for those who carry out the Cold War and try to slander all progressive and revolutionary movements. He turned his name and activities into a political tool in the hands of reactionaries.
    Soviet prominent political commentator Zaslavsky condemned the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Pasternak. In an article published in "Pravda" on the 26th, he said that the reactionary bourgeoisie awarded the Nobel Prize to Pasternak not because he was a poet or writer, but because he was a slanderer. While pointing out that the image of Doctor Zhivago is a distortion of reality, Zaslavsky wrote that the outstanding intellectuals of the old Russian era were associated with Timiryazev, Pavlov, Michurin, Tsiolkovsky, etc. They cooperated closely with young Soviet scientists and achieved unprecedented achievements in all aspects of culture and science.
    The former members of the editorial board of "New World" magazine also pointed out in a letter to "Literary Gazette" on the 25th that awarding Pasternak the Nobel Prize was purely a political action hostile to the Soviet Union and aimed at inciting the Cold War.

    坚决清除反苏反社会主义的毒草
    苏联作家协会开除帕斯捷尔纳克
    帕斯捷尔纳克的小说“日瓦戈医生”严重歪曲现实，是一部明显地反苏、反艺术的作品。在受到批判后，他竟把手稿寄往国外发表，成为西方资产阶级进行冷战的宣传工具。西方资产阶级授予帕斯捷尔纳克以诺贝尔奖金，不是因为他是诗人、作家，而是因为他是诽谤家。
    新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联“文学报”今天报道，苏联作家协会27日通过决定，把恶毒诬蔑社会主义革命、苏联人民和苏联知识分子的小说“日瓦戈医生”的作者帕斯捷尔纳克清除出苏联作家协会。
    据苏联报刊报道，帕斯捷尔纳克小说中的日瓦戈医生，是一位旧俄资产阶级知识分子，一个感情低级、思想庸俗的市侩。革命使他不能再按“常规”生活下去，他向往旧的资产阶级的制度，他仇视革命，仇视新的制度。但是，帕斯捷尔纳克却把这个坚持个人主义而最后滚到反动立场上的医生，描写成为旧俄知识界的“优秀”代表。他用恶意歪曲现实的手法通过日瓦戈医生描绘了一幅俄国知识分子在新社会“毁灭”的图景。1956年9月，苏联“新世界”杂志曾经拒绝出版这部明显地反苏、反艺术的作品，并给帕斯捷尔纳克写了一封很长的退稿信，对这部小说作了详尽的批判的分析。但是他却走上了沾辱苏联作家崇高称号的道路，把这部小说的手稿寄往国外，交由那些公开反对社会主义的人出版。这部小说一经出版，立即受到西方资产阶级的欢迎，反动报刊围绕这部小说掀起了反苏叫嚣。瑞典科学院竟在10月23日秉承大资产阶级的意志，把今年的诺贝尔文学奖金授给了这部没有任何文学价值的小说的作者。
    苏联作家协会的决定是在苏联作家协会委员会主席团、俄罗斯联邦作家协会组织委员会执行局和作家协会莫斯科分会委员会主席团联席会议上一致通过的。决定强调指出，帕斯捷尔纳克的行径是同苏联作家的称号不相容的，是同俄罗斯文学传统、人民、和平和社会主义相敌对的。帕斯捷尔纳克开始是宣扬“纯粹的艺术”，最后则成为资产阶级宣传工具，成为进行冷战、极力诽谤一切进步和革命运动的人的有利投机对象。他把他的名字和活动变成了反动派手中的政治工具。
    苏联著名政论家萨斯拉夫斯基谴责了授予帕斯捷尔纳克诺贝尔奖金的行为。他在26日在“真理报”上撰文说，反动的资产阶级之所以把诺贝尔奖金奖给帕斯捷尔纳克，不是因为他是诗人，是作家，而是因为他是诽谤家。萨斯拉夫斯基在指出日瓦戈医生的形象是对现实的歪曲时写道，旧俄时代的优秀知识分子是同季米里亚泽夫、巴甫洛夫、米丘林、齐奥尔科夫斯基等有联系的，他们同年轻的苏维埃科学家密切合作，在文化科学各方面取得了空前巨大的成就。
    “新世界”杂志前编委会委员们25日在给“文学报”的信中也指出，授予帕斯捷尔纳克以诺贝尔奖金，纯粹是一个敌视苏联、企图煽起冷战的政治行动。
