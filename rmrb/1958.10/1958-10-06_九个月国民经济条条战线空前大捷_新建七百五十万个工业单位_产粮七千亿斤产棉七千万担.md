Xinhua News Agency, October 5th. Exciting news has been constantly pouring in from all fronts of the national economy in the third quarter. According to materials provided by the State Statistical Bureau, the total value of industrial and handicraft output in the third quarter reached 32.6 billion yuan (excluding industries run by agricultural cooperatives and people's communes), an increase of nearly 100% compared with the same period last year. In the hard work of September, steel production increased day by day, reaching new peaks, with new achievements appearing every day. Currently, about 40 to 50 million people across the country have joined this battle for the whole people to make steel in a big way, determined to double China's steel production this year compared to last year. On the agricultural front, reports of bumper harvests have been coming one after another. This year, the total grain output of the country may reach more than 700 billion jin, which is almost double that of last year. Following China's wheat production exceeding that of the United States and ranking second in the world, this year China's total cotton output is expected to reach about 70 million dan, surpassing the United States and ranking first in the world.

    Industrial Output Value Increased by 57% Compared with the Same Period Last Year
    According to the report of the State Statistical Bureau on the implementation of the national economic plan in the third quarter, under the situation of the whole party and the whole people running industries in a big way, industrial production has achieved unprecedented high-speed development. The cumulative total output value from January to September increased by 57% compared with the same period last year, exceeding any previous year.
    Due to the earnest implementation of the Party's proposed construction policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, simultaneously developing large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, combining indigenous methods with foreign methods, and the whole people running industries, industrial construction has achieved unprecedented leaps and bounds this year. From the first quarter to the third quarter, about 7.5 million new industrial and handicraft enterprises were built across the country, of which about 6 million units were run by agricultural cooperatives and people's communes. Since the third quarter, a mass movement of the whole party and the whole people grasping steel has been formed. From January to September 21, a total of about 500,000 small blast furnaces and indigenous blast furnaces have been built across the country, of which 175,000 have been put into production. Many provinces and autonomous regions that did not produce or rarely produced steel in the past have now released or are striving to release high-yield "satellites." The national steel output in September increased by 44% compared with August, and the iron output increased by 93%.
    In order to ensure the "marshal" of steel ascends the stage, the manufacture of metallurgical equipment has seen a great leap forward. From June 1 to 21 alone, 993 sets of blast furnace equipment were produced, equal to 51% of the total output from January to August; 735 sets of converters, equal to 157% of the output from January to August. The complete sets of power generation equipment produced in September were 172,000 kilowatts, an increase of nearly two times over the previous month.
    The power generation in September was 2.56 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 4.1% over the previous month; from January to September, the national power generation was 19.17 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 38.5% over the same period last year. From January to September, the cumulative newly added power generation capacity nationwide was 1.3544 million kilowatts.
    From the first to the third quarter of this year, other important industrial products have also increased greatly compared with the same period last year. Raw coal increased by 58.4%, crude oil increased by 45.8%, nitrogen fertilizer increased by 64.7%, cement increased by 33.4%, timber increased by 25.4%, and cotton cloth increased by 31.4%.
    On the basis of continuously liberating the mind and breaking the concept of technical mystery, the technical revolution movement was further deepened in the third quarter. From the first to the third quarter, employees across the country proposed about 9.6 million technical innovation projects, and successfully trial-produced 87,000 new products, of which 42,000 were successfully trial-produced in the third quarter.

    Wheat and Cotton Overwhelm the United States, Cotton Production Ranks First in the World
    In agriculture, it is currently the busiest season for autumn harvest and autumn planting, and the large-scale harvesting of crops has already begun. The total amount of grain harvested in summer and early autumn across the country has reached more than 360 billion jin, close to the total grain output of the entire year last year. According to the estimates of various regions in late September, the total grain output of China this year may reach more than 700 billion jin, an increase of nearly 100% compared with last year, equivalent to more than twice the highest annual output before liberation. Calculated on the basis of the national population, the average grain per person this year can reach more than 1,000 jin.
    In 1958, China's total cotton output has jumped to the first place in the world, and is expected to reach about 70 million dan, an increase of more than 100% compared with last year, more than 17 million dan more than the U.S. Department of Agriculture's announced estimated output of U.S. cotton in 1958 of 52.53 million dan; China's cotton yield per unit area has jumped from an average of 38 jin per mu in 1957 to an average of 91 jin per mu this year, an increase of 1.4 times. It is estimated that there are six provinces and cities, including Zhejiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, with an average yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, among which the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in Zhejiang and Shanghai can reach more than 150 jin.
    The increase in the output of soybeans and various major oil crops this year has also greatly exceeded that of any previous year.
    The State Statistical Bureau's materials on the brief situation of transportation, commerce, and culture and education are:

    Transportation Volume Increased by 23%, Retail Sales of Goods Increased by 11.4%
    (1) Transportation: From January to September this year, the freight volume of various means of transportation increased by 23% compared with the same period last year, of which railway transportation increased by 31% and water transportation increased by 34%. Due to the unprecedented great leap forward of the entire national economy with steel as the key link, transportation in September was still very tight. At present, all railway employees, water transport employees, and all employees in other departments of transportation across the country are fighting with all their strength, and good news continues to come.
    (2) Commerce: In the first nine months of this year, a new phenomenon of no slack season in the off-season, early peak season, and overall increase in both urban and rural areas appeared in the national market. The retail sales of social commodities increased quarter by quarter, with the second quarter increasing by 11.8% compared with the first quarter, and the third quarter increasing by 6.6% compared with the second quarter. Prices have remained stable. The cumulative retail sales in the first three quarters of this year increased by 11.4% compared with the same period last year. The supply of means of production has increased rapidly, with the supply of agricultural means of production alone increasing by 1.2 times compared with the same period last year. The supply of means of subsistence increased by 3.3% compared with the same period last year.

    Universities Increased Threefold, Middle Schools Increased Elevenfold, Illiteracy Eliminated for More Than 90 Million People
    (3) Culture and Education: The cultural revolution has entered a climax, and the education cause has developed rapidly. As of September 20, there were more than 1,000 institutions of higher learning nationwide (excluding spare-time universities and red and expert universities), an increase of three times compared with 1957; the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher learning reached about 700,000, an increase of 66% compared with 1957. There were more than 150,000 middle schools, an increase of eleven times compared with last year; with more than 14 million students, an increase of nearly 100% compared with last year. There were 936,000 primary schools, with 92.61 million students, an increase of 44% compared with last year. 774 counties and cities across the country have established institutions of higher learning, 1,546 counties and cities have achieved the goal of having middle schools in every township, and 1,936 counties and cities have popularized primary school education. The literacy campaign has also seen unprecedented development, with the number of people who have graduated from literacy studies across the country reaching about 94 million, and 1,483 counties and cities across the country have eliminated illiteracy. Jilin, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Henan, Fujian, Guizhou and other provinces have basically eliminated illiteracy throughout the province.

    九个月国民经济条条战线空前大捷
    新建七百五十万个工业单位  产粮七千亿斤产棉七千万担
    新华社5日讯　第三季度国民经济战线上不断传来令人兴奋的消息。据国家统计局提供的材料表明，第三季度全国工业和手工业总产值达三百二十六亿元（不包括农业社和人民公社社办工业），比去年同期增长几近一倍。在9月份的奋战中，钢铁生产与日俱增，达到了新的高峰，每天都有新的成就出现。目前，全国大约有四、五千万人投入了这场全民大搞钢铁的战斗，决心要使今年我国钢的产量比去年翻一番。在农业战线上，丰收捷报一个接着一个，今年全国粮食总产量可能达到七千亿斤以上，与去年比较差不多可以翻一番；继我国小麦产量超过美国跃居世界第二位之后，今年我国棉花总产量预计可达七千万担左右，又超过美国而跃居世界第一位。
    工业总产值比去年同期增长57％
    根据国家统计局关于第三季度国民经济计划执行情况的报告，在全党全民大办工业的形势下，工业生产获得了从未有过的高速度发展，1月至9月累计总产值比去年同期增长57％，超过以往任何一年。
    由于认真贯彻执行了党提出的中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中、小型企业同时并举，土办法和洋办法相结合以及全民办工业等建设方针，今年工业建设获得了空前的飞跃发展。一季度至三季度全国新建的工业和手工业企业约七百五十万个，其中农业社和人民公社办的约有六百万个单位。第三季度以来，更形成了一个全党全民大抓钢铁的群众运动。从1月至9月21日，全国累计建成小高炉和土高炉约计五十万座左右，投入生产的已有十七点五万座。过去许多不产或很少产钢铁的省、自治区，现在已经放出或正在争取放出高产“卫星”。9月份全国钢产量比8月份增加了44％，铁产量增加93％。
    为确保钢铁“元帅”升帐，冶金设备的制造出现了大跃进的局面。仅6月1日至21日就生产了高炉设备九百九十三套，等于1月至8月总产量的51％；转炉设备七百三十五套，等于1月至8月的157％。9月份生产的成套发电设备有十七万二千瓩，比上月增长近两倍。
    9月份的发电量为二十五点六亿度，比上月增加4.1％；1—9月份，全国发电量为一百九十一点七亿度，比去年同期增加了38.5％。1—9月份全国累计新增加的发电能力，有一百三十五万四千瓩。
    今年一——三季度其他重要工业产品，比去年同期也都有很大的增长。原煤增长58.4％，原油增长45.8％，氮肥增长64.7％，水泥增长33.4％，原木增长25.4％，棉布增长31.4％。
    在不断解放思想、打破技术神秘观点的基础上，第三季度技术革命运动更加深入了。一至三季度全国职工提出技术革新项目约九百六十万件，试制成功的新产品有八万七千种，其中第三季试制成功四万二千种。
  小麦棉花压倒美国，棉产量跃居世界第一
    农业方面，目前正是秋收秋种最忙的季节，农作物的大量收获已经开始。全国夏季和早秋已收获的粮食达三千六百多亿斤，接近去年全年粮食总产量。根据各地9月下旬的预计，今年全年我国粮食总产量可能达到七千亿斤以上，比去年增长将近一倍，相当于解放前最高年产量的两倍还多。按全国人口计算，今年每人平均粮食可达一千多斤。
    1958年我国棉花总产量已跃居世界第一，预计可达七千万担左右，比去年增长一倍还多，比美国农业部宣布的1958年美国棉花预计产量五千二百五十三万担还要多一千七百多万担；我国棉花单位面积产量已由1957年平均每亩三十八斤跃到今年的平均每亩九十一斤，增长一点四倍。预计平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的有浙江、上海、湖北、河北、陕西、山西等六个省市，其中浙江、上海两个省市平均亩产皮棉可达一百五十斤以上。
    今年大豆和各种主要油料作物的增产幅度也大大超过了以往任何一年。
    国家统计局的材料中关于交通运输、商业和文教方面的简要情况是：
  运输量增长23％，商品零售额增长11.4％
    （一）交通运输：今年1月至9月，各种运输工具的货运量比去年同期增长23％，其中铁路运输增长31％，水运增长34％。由于以钢为纲的整个国民经济的史无前例的大跃进，9月份交通运输仍然十分紧张。目前，全国铁路职工、水运职工和交通运输其他部门的所有职工，都在全力奋战，喜讯不断传来。
    （二）商业：今年头九个月，全国市场出现了淡季不淡、旺季提早、城乡全升的新气象。社会商品零售额逐季增长，第二季度比第一季度增长11.8％，第三季度又比第二季度增长6.6％。物价一直保持稳定。今年头三个季度累计零售额比去年同期增长11.4％。生产资料的供应增长较快，单农业生产资料的供应额就比去年同期增长一点二倍。生活资料供应额比去年同期增长了3.3％。
  大学增三倍，中学增十一倍，扫盲九千多万人
    （三）文教事业：文化革命已进入高潮，教育事业突飞猛进。截至9月20日，全国已有高等学校一千多所（不包括业余大学和红专大学），比1957年增长三倍；高等学校在校人数达到七十万人左右，比1957年增长66％。中等学校十五万多所，比去年增加了十一倍；学生一千四百多万人，比去年增加近一倍。小学校九十三万六千所，学生九千二百六十一万人，比去年增加44％。全国已有七百七十四个县、市设立了高等学校，有一千五百四十六个县、市达到了乡乡有中学，有一千九百三十六个县、市普及了小学教育。扫盲运动也有了空前的发展，全国扫盲学习毕业的人数已约达九千四百万人，全国已有一千四百八十三个县市扫除了文盲。吉林、黑龙江、浙江、河南、福建、贵州等省，已经在全省范围内基本上扫除了文盲。
