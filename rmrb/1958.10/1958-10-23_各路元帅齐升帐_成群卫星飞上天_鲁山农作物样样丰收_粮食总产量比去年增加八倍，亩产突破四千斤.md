Our Newspaper Dispatch: Reporter Jin Feng reports: Marxism produces grain, which has once again been vividly proven in Lushan, Henan.

The people of Lushan, holding high the red flag of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, while vigorously engaging in steel production, have further improved agricultural production and achieved an unprecedented comprehensive autumn harvest. According to statistics from collected harvests: the total output of autumn grain from over 490,000 mu in the entire commune (i.e., the entire county) reached 1,763,130,000 jin, an increase of 11.6 times compared to last year, with an average yield of 3,557 jin per mu, an increase of 9.16 times compared to last year's yield per mu. Including summer grain, Lushan's total grain output this year reached 1,984,130,000 jin, an increase of 8.1 times compared to last year; the average yield was 4,040 jin per mu, an increase of 10.54 times compared to last year. The 430,000 commune members in the entire commune have an average of 4,582 jin of grain per person, far exceeding the level of all capitalist countries in the world. The per-unit area yield of all crops in the commune, such as corn, sweet potatoes, rice, millet, sorghum, mung beans, peanuts, sesame, and tobacco, has reached the standard of a "Marshal County." At the same time, many high-yield "satellites" have been launched in mountainous areas, plains, hills, and slopes. This year's autumn harvest scene in Lushan County is truly one where marshals from all sides are setting up camp, and satellites are flying into the sky in droves.

The main reasons for Lushan's bumper grain harvest this year are, first, the county party committee took political thought as the commander, deeply mobilized the masses, earnestly implemented the spirit of the General Line, and prominently resolved the idea of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, forming a vigorous mass movement of great leaps forward in industry and agriculture throughout the county. In order to strive for a double bumper harvest of steel and grain, the CCP Lushan County Committee grasped industry with its right hand and agriculture with its left hand. While working hard on steel production, it strengthened its leadership over agricultural production and changed its past method of all-encompassing leadership. The county party committee divided the work and delineated battle lines: two secretaries and eight committee members were in charge of industry, while the other two secretaries and eight committee members were in charge of agriculture.

After the leadership ideology and division of labor were resolved, under the unified ideological guidance of the county party committee, and after the summer bumper harvest, a great blooming and great debate on whether steel and agriculture could leap forward simultaneously and how to achieve it was carried out throughout the county. The slogan was put forward: "The whole party and the whole people are mobilized, industry and agriculture compete, labor and animal power cooperate well, the front and rear are not disconnected, steel satellites take off, agricultural satellites soar into the clouds, the two marshals set up camp together, and always strive to be the best," fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of hundreds of thousands of people. Through propaganda, education, blooming and debate, the masses realized the dialectical relationship between industrial development and agricultural development, and realized that ensuring local industry was built on the basis of agricultural development, and that it was impossible to develop industry without the support of agriculture. The masses also realized the great role of developing steel production in agricultural mechanization and electrification, as well as the importance of steel production in accelerating socialist construction. The negative and erroneous ideas of a few people who believed that "with the great leap forward in steel, agriculture cannot leap forward" and "steel is important in the future, and agriculture is not important" were criticized. After the ideological problems were largely resolved, a competition between the industrial front and the agricultural front was launched throughout the county, supporting and promoting each other, forming a mass movement of great leaps forward in industry and agriculture in which more than 200,000 people regularly participated. In the production process, the county party committee always adhered to communist education and the struggle between the two roads. For example, determining production targets was an acute struggle with right-leaning conservative thinking.

Secondly, the establishment of the new-type organization of the People's Commune greatly liberated the productive forces and powerfully supported the great construction of industry and agriculture. In August of this year, Lushan established a People's Commune in the entire county. Human, financial, and material resources completely broke through the boundaries of the past 430 small cooperatives, which ensured that while nearly 100,000 laborers were transferred to work hard on the steel industry, there were still more than 100,000 laborers concentrated on tackling agriculture in the county. Because the commune realized the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, and the collectivization of life, it greatly improved labor efficiency and completely liberated the women masses. Due to the establishment of other welfare organizations and the improvement of mass awareness, the number of laborers in the county increased from 180,000 to 240,000. Wheat harvesting and autumn field management mainly relied on women, the elderly, and teenagers as auxiliary laborers, which ensured that steel and grain could both set up camp at the same time in terms of labor. In addition, the commune implemented the integration of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and the integration of county and commune, which reduced the contradictions between different departments and sectors in the past in terms of organization, and comprehensively ensured the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production under the unified leadership of the commune.

Thirdly, the whole county conscientiously implemented the "water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, plus field management" agricultural production constitution, especially the widespread establishment of satellite command fields, which created favorable conditions for large-scale high yields. This year, the county carried out large-scale water conservancy projects, and 88% of the cultivated land was irrigated, increasing the area of irrigated land from 250,000 mu last year to 530,000 mu, greatly reducing water and drought disasters. This allowed the area to avoid disaster from a single rainfall of more than 300 millimeters this autumn, and enabled the planting of wheat during the two months of drought in the summer. In terms of accumulating and applying fertilizer, 50,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu during the wheat season, and 90,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu during the autumn season, with three or more applications of base fertilizer and top dressing, completely eliminating "pale-faced land." All autumn fields were deep-plowed to a depth of more than one foot, with the deepest reaching three to four feet. Rational close planting of various crops was carried out, and improved varieties were implemented. In terms of autumn field management, there were three or more cultivations and weedings, and two or more weed removals, achieving weed-free conditions. The masses were also organized in a timely manner to eliminate diseases and insect pests, and artificial pollination was implemented.

The satellite command fields played a good organizational and demonstration role in realizing all these yield-increasing measures. The satellite command field was first implemented by Fengli Cooperative, led by Wen Xianglan, a national labor model of Zhangliang Branch Commune, and was later promoted throughout the county. It was generally established by the cooperative cadres and production team leaders, and each person was assigned work, and this satellite command field commanded several mu of large-scale operation areas. The satellite command field took the lead in implementing the agricultural production constitution. Each time a technical measure was carried out, an on-site meeting was held for demonstration, and the large-scale operation area was carried out in the same way. The measures required were the same, but the quantities were lower. After doing so, the cadres also inspected the quality, which made the technology of agricultural high yield popular and comprehensive in a timely manner. It is a powerful means for leaders and the masses to combine to promote large-scale high yield. Now, the entire county and the entire commune are launching a huge scale of "Three Autumns" wheat planting upsurge, striving to guarantee a wheat yield of 5,000 jin per mu next year, and striving for an annual grain yield of double 10,000 jin per mu.

    各路元帅齐升帐　成群卫星飞上天
    鲁山农作物样样丰收
    粮食总产量比去年增加八倍，亩产突破四千斤
    本报讯　记者金凤报道：马克思主义出粮食，在河南鲁山又一次得到生动的证明。
    鲁山人民高举工农业并举的红旗，在大搞钢铁生产的同时，进一步搞好了农业生产，获得了空前未有的秋季全面大丰收。据已收情况统计：全公社（即全县）四十九万多亩秋粮，总产达十七亿六千三百一十三万斤，比去年增产十一点六倍，平均亩产三千五百五十七斤，比去年亩产增产九点一六倍。连同夏季粮食在内，鲁山今年粮食总产量达十九亿八千四百一十三万斤，比去年增产八点一倍；平均亩产四千零四十斤，比去年增产十点五四倍。全公社四十三万社员，平均每人有粮食四千五百八十二斤，远远超过世界上所有资本主义国家的水平。公社所有玉米、红薯、水稻、谷子、高粱、绿豆、花生、芝麻、烟叶等各种作物的单位面积产量，都达到元帅县的标准。同时不论山区、平原、丘陵、坡地均放出许多高额丰产的卫星。鲁山县今年的秋收景象真正是各路元帅齐升帐，成群卫星飞上天。
    鲁山今年粮食丰收的主要原因，首先是县委以政治思想为统帅，深入发动群众，认真贯彻总路线的精神，突出解决了工农业并举的思想，在全县形成了轰轰烈烈的工农业大跃进的群众运动。中共鲁山县委为了力争钢铁和粮食双丰收，右手抓工业，左手抓农业，在大干钢铁的同时，加强了对农业生产的领导，改变了过去一揽子的领导方法。县委分工划分战线：两个书记、八个委员管工业，另外两个书记、八个委员管农业。
    领导思想及分工解决以后，在县委的统一的思想指导下，在夏季大丰收以后，在全县范围内开展了钢铁和农业能不能齐跃进，怎样齐跃进的大鸣大放、大辩论，并提出了：“全党全民总动员，工业农业比着干，劳力畜力配合好，前方后方不脱节，钢铁卫星腾空起，农业卫星冲云霄，两个元帅齐升帐，永占上游争第一”的豪迈口号，充分调动数十万群众的生产积极性。通过宣传教育和鸣放辩论，使群众认识到工业发展和农业发展的辩证关系，认识到保证地方工业是在农业发展的基础上搞起来的，发展工业没有农业的支援是不行的。又使群众认识到发展钢铁生产对于农业机械化、电气化的巨大作用，以及钢铁生产对于加速社会主义建设的重要意义。批判了少数人认为“钢铁大跃进，农业就无法跃进了”和“今后钢铁重要，农业就不重要了”等消极错误思想。在思想问题大体解决以后，即在全县开展工业战线和农业战线的竞赛，互相支援、互相促进，形成了经常有二十万以上群众参加的工农业大跃进的群众运动。在生产过程中，县委又始终坚持了共产主义教育和两条道路的斗争。如确定生产指标，就是一场尖锐的同右倾保守思想之间的斗争。
    其次，人民公社这一新型组织的建立，大大解放了生产力，有力地支援了工农业大建设。鲁山在今年8月全县建立了一个人民公社，人力财力物力完全打破了过去四百三十个小社的界限，这就保证在抽调近十万劳力大办钢铁工业的同时，全县还有十多万劳力集中突击农业。因为公社实现了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，大大提高了劳动效率，彻底解放了妇女群众。由于其他福利组织建立，以及群众觉悟的提高，全县劳力由十八万名增加到二十四万名。麦收、秋田管理，主要依靠妇女及老人、少年等辅助劳力，这才在劳力方面保证了钢、粮二帅的同时升帐。此外，公社实行工农商学兵合一、县社合一，在组织上减少了过去条条与块块之间的矛盾，各部门集中在公社的统一领导下，全面保证工农业生产的大跃进。
    第三，全县认真执行了“水、肥、
  土、种、密，加上田间管理”这个农业生产的宪法，特别是卫星指挥田的普遍建立，更为大面积丰产创造了有利条件。全县今年大兴水利，88％的耕地水利化，水浇地的面积由去年的二十五万亩扩大到五十三万亩，大大减轻了水旱灾害，使今秋一次降雨三百多公厘没受灾，夏季两月不雨，抗旱种上了麦。积肥、施肥方面，麦季每亩施肥五万斤，秋季施肥每亩九万斤，普遍施底肥、追肥三遍以上，有的施到四遍五遍，彻底消灭了“白脸地”。所有秋田深翻一尺以上，最深的达三尺四尺。各种作物进行了合理密植，实行了良种化，在秋田管理方面，中耕锄草三遍以上，拔草两次以上，达到了无草化。又及时组织群众消灭了病虫害，实行了人工授粉。
    所有这些增产措施的实现，卫星指挥田起了良好的组织与示范作用。卫星指挥田由张良分社全国劳动模范文香兰领导的丰丽社最早实行，后来推广到全县。一般由社干部和生产队长一级直接指挥生产的干部建立，每人分工，由这块卫星指挥田指挥若干亩大面积作业区。卫星指挥田带头执行农业生产的宪法，每进行一项技术措施，即召开现场会议示范，大面积作业区即照样进行。措施要求一样，只是数量低些，做了以后，干部还验收质量，这就使农业丰产的技术及时普及全面，是领导和群众相结合推行大面积丰产的有力手段。现在全县全公社正掀起一个巨大规模的三秋种麦高潮，为保证明年小麦亩产五千斤，力争全年粮食亩产双万斤而奋斗。
