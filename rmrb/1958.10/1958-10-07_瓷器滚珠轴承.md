    Porcelain Ball Bearings
    Workers of the Fourth Porcelain Factory's Fen Ding Fourth Group and the Thirteenth Porcelain Factory's Experimental Group in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, have successfully trial-produced porcelain ball bearings. This is a new creation of using porcelain instead of steel. After assessment, this batch of ball bearings performed well. When used on electric jigger machines for porcelain production, their rotation speed and hardness were the same as those made of steel. Installed on large flatbed carts, they could carry six adults or six hundred catties of refractory bricks.
    To enhance the pressure resistance of porcelain ball bearings, the workers are continuing their research and improvement with even greater enthusiasm. (Xu Yin Jie)

    瓷器滚珠轴承
    江西景德镇第四瓷厂粉定四组和第十三瓷厂试验组工人，试制成功瓷器滚珠轴承。这是以瓷代钢铁的一个新创造。这批滚珠轴承，经过鉴定，效果良好。用于制瓷的电动轭辘车上，转速和硬度同钢铁制成的一样。安装在大板车上，可载六个成人或六百斤重的耐火砖。
    为了增强瓷器滚珠轴承的耐压力，工人们正以更大的干劲继续研究改进。　（徐银洁）
