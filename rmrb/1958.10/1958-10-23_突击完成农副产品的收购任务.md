    Rush to Complete the Procurement Task of Agricultural and Sideline Products

    This year, agricultural products such as grain, oil crops, cotton, tobacco, and hemp will have unprecedented bumper harvests. It is estimated that the total grain output will reach 700 to 800 billion jin, an increase of about double last year. The total cotton output will reach more than 70 million dan, an increase of more than double last year. The total tobacco output will reach about 20 million dan, an increase of about four times last year. The total output of oil crops and hemp has also increased significantly compared to last year. Therefore, seizing the opportunity to mobilize the masses to carry out meticulous harvesting, picking, and stripping, and vigorously developing procurement work, has become an extremely urgent and arduous task at present. In addition, there are a wide variety of local and special products and wild plants with abundant resources that need to be collected, vigorously purchased, and fully utilized in a timely manner. This is of great significance for increasing farmers' income, developing mountainous economies, supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and expanding export sources.

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on strengthening the procurement of cotton and tobacco on August 30, many regions have earnestly implemented the procurement policy of "quick collection, more collection, good collection, and sufficient collection" while vigorously engaging in steel production and autumn plowing and planting. They have carried out the collection and procurement of grain, oil crops, cotton, tobacco, hemp, and other local and special products. In particular, after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued an emergency notice on October 6 regarding seizing the time for autumn harvest and planting, many regions launched a mass movement of harvesting, picking, and selling. For example, after two days of preparation, three days of concentrated effort, and one day of finishing touches, Dancheng County in Henan Province purchased and stored 109.25% of its original planned grain. In early October, Hebei Province organized a 2.88 million-strong army of cotton pickers and sellers within three days, and the amount of cotton picked and sold increased rapidly. Shulu County was able to pick more than 6 million jin of seed cotton every day, and purchased 15.26 million jin on October 12 alone. However, in some other regions, due to the lack of good overall arrangements and a failure to closely focus on autumn harvest work, large amounts of grain and oil crops were not harvested, exposed to the sun, sold, or transported in a timely manner. In some areas, large amounts of cotton had burst forth, but were still not picked in a timely manner; the cotton that had been picked was not processed and purchased in a timely manner, and quickly sent to the cotton mills. In some areas, large amounts of tobacco leaves matured, but were not picked in time and dried in the fields, causing great losses. In some areas, hemp crops were not harvested and stripped in time, which not only affected the yield, but also reduced the quality of the products. Some wild plant oil crops and starches were also not collected in time, and large quantities of them rotted in the fields. Judging from the national procurement situation, there is a problem of slow procurement progress and untimely transportation for grain, oil crops, cotton, tobacco, hemp, and other local and special products, which affects the supply of cities and industrial and mining areas. If this situation is not reversed as soon as possible, it will cause even greater losses. We know that if every mu of cotton field loses one jin of cotton, the country will harvest 900,000 dan less, and weave 10 million fewer bolts of cloth. Therefore, we must seize the opportunity to collect quickly and collect more, conscientiously achieve a bumper harvest, and ensure that the vast number of farmers receive all the fruits of their year of hard work.

    Now, the picking and procurement of grain, cotton, oil crops, tobacco, hemp, and local and special products has entered its peak season. In order to ensure that all the fruits of this year's agricultural harvest are obtained, and in order to complete this year's agricultural product procurement tasks, Party committees in various regions must, in accordance with the spirit of the "Emergency Instructions on Rushing to Complete the Procurement and Transportation Tasks of Agricultural Products" issued today by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, immediately make a comprehensive arrangement of the current main work, conscientiously plan and schedule labor, and while vigorously engaging in steel production, deep plowing, and autumn planting, strengthen the leadership of the harvesting, picking, processing, procurement, and transportation of grain, oil crops, cotton, tobacco, hemp, and other important local and special products, fully mobilize the masses, and quickly carry out these tasks. It must be pointed out that whether this work is done well not only directly affects this year's bumper harvest and whether we can strive for a greater bumper harvest next year, but also affects the supply of urban industrial and mining areas and export goods, which is of great significance.

    In order to achieve the procurement policy of "quick collection, more collection, good collection, and sufficient collection," on the agricultural and sideline product procurement front, the Party committee must also take the lead, leading cadres must personally take charge, and a harvest, picking, and procurement army, mainly composed of people's communes and participated in by a broad number of women, children, students, and workers, must be formed to carry out mass procurement and transportation movements. This year, the amount of agricultural and sideline products procured is larger and more concentrated than in previous years, especially the amount of agricultural and sideline products that should be picked but have not been picked, should be collected but have not been collected, and should be transported but have not been transported is very large, the task is very heavy, and the time is very tight. However, as long as we strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, everyone takes action, forms a movement, and comprehensively plans according to the picking seasons of various products, adopts the method of large-scale movements encompassing small-scale movements, organically combines central tasks with general tasks, and intersperses them rhythmically, organizes several concentrated procurement and transportation battles, we will be able to complete and overfulfill the state's procurement and transportation tasks quickly, well, and economically while ensuring the marshal's ascension. Under the unified arrangement of the Party committee, Sichuan Province used the gaps between the two major movements of steel and agriculture, and adopted the method of concentrated efforts to carry out the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, which greatly promoted the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Tanghe County in Henan Province, led by the county Party secretary, with cadres contracted to specific areas and comprehensively arranged labor, organized a large army to pick cotton, and carried out three concentrated efforts, picking a total of 26 million jin of cotton, basically achieving timely picking. These are all new procurement methods suitable for the current new situation in rural areas and are worth promoting.

    The problem is very clear, and the comprehensive arrangement of labor is an extremely important issue. Now the early autumn harvest has been completed, and the deep plowing task will also be completed. In particular, the realization of the people's commune in rural areas are all favorable conditions for uniformly arranging labor and organizing the collection, sale, and procurement of agricultural and sideline products. Various regions can transfer a portion of fixed labor to undertake the picking, processing, and transportation of grain, oil crops, cotton, tobacco, and hemp, and to carry out the picking and procurement of certain large-scale local and sideline products, to ensure the supply of raw materials needed for the great leap forward in industrial production and export goods, and to support the needs of larger-scale water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

    According to the new situation of people's communes, this year's procurement of agricultural and sideline products must fully mobilize the masses and rely on the people's communes. At present, many regions are implementing the "four selfs" method, where the people's communes weigh, grade, package, settle accounts, store, or directly send them to processing plants (or state warehouses) themselves, which not only greatly saves labor and reduces costs, but also improves product quality and speeds up the procurement process. This method is beneficial to both the people's communes and the state, and should be vigorously promoted. In the process of implementation, commercial departments must pay special attention to strengthening technical guidance and instruction.

    In addition, to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, we must also pay attention to solving problems such as processing, packaging, transportation, and storage. Solving these problems also requires relying on the masses. Especially in the case of tight labor, we should give full play to the masses in vigorously carrying out technical innovation, reforming production tools, and promoting advanced experiences, and try to achieve picking, collection, processing, and transportation simultaneously.

    In order to meet the needs of the people's communes to purchase means of production and means of livelihood after selling agricultural products, and in order to guide the people's communes and commune members to rationally use the funds obtained after selling agricultural products, commercial departments and financial departments must also do a good job in rural material supply and savings deposits. To quickly transport industrial products to rural areas to support the procurement of agricultural products; to quickly transport grain and raw materials for non-staple food industries to cities and industrial and mining areas to ensure the supply of materials to cities and industrial and mining areas, this is an urgent task in the current national economy. Various regions should insert concentrated transportation of industrial and agricultural products in the middle of steel and coal transportation, combining concentrated transportation with regular transportation; combining modern transportation tools with folk transportation tools; and organizing all forces that can be organized (including transportation forces of government agencies, organizations, schools, and residents), and making full use of all returning vehicles and ships, to do everything possible to complete the transportation tasks.

    突击完成农副产品的收购任务
    今年粮食、油料、棉、烟、麻等农产品都将获得空前大丰收。预计粮食总产量可达七千至八千亿斤，比去年增加一倍上下。棉花总产量可达七千多万担，比去年增产一倍以上。烟叶总产量可达二千万担左右，比去年增长四倍左右。油料和麻的总产量也比去年增长很多。因此，抓紧时机，发动群众进行精细的收获、采摘和剥制，并大力开展收购工作，已成为当前一项十分紧迫而又繁重的任务。此外，还有品种繁多、资源丰富的土、特产品和野生植物等，需要及时采集，大力收购和充分利用。这对增加农民收入，发展山区经济，支援工农业生产大跃进，扩大出口货源，都具有重要的意义。
    自8月30日中共中央和国务院发布了关于加强棉花、烟叶收购工作的指示后，不少地区在大搞钢铁生产和秋耕、秋种的同时，认真贯彻执行了“快收、多收、收好、收足”的采购方针，开展了粮食、油料、棉、烟、麻和其他土特产品的采集、收购工作。特别是中共中央和国务院10月6日发出关于抓紧秋收、秋种工作的紧急通知后，许多地区掀起了群众性的收获、采摘、出售运动。比如，河南省郸城县经过两天准备，三天突击，一天扫尾，征购入库的粮食占原计划的109.25％。河北省10月上旬在三天内就组织了二百八十八万人的采棉、售棉大军，采摘、出售的数量都迅速增加。束鹿县每天就能采摘籽棉六百多万斤，仅在10月12日一天就收购一千五百二十六万斤。但是，还有些地区，由于没有很好地全面安排，对于秋收工作抓得不紧，以致大量粮食、油料没有及时收割、曝晒、出售和调运。有些地区棉花大量吐絮，仍未能及时采摘；已经采摘的棉花，也没有及时加工和收购，迅速地送到纱厂。有的地区烟叶大量成熟，没有及时采摘而干在地里，造成很大损失。有的地区的麻类，因未能及时收割剥制，不仅影响了产量，而且降低了产品质量。有些野生植物油料和淀粉也未及时采集，有很大数量熟烂在地里。从全国的收购情况来看，粮食、油料、棉、烟、麻和其他土、特产品都存在着收购进度不快和调运不及时的情况，影响到城市和工矿区的供应。这种情况如不及早扭转，必将造成更大的损失。我们知道，如果每亩棉田损失一斤棉花，全国就要少收九十万担，少织一千万匹布。因此，我们必须抓紧时机，快收、多收，认真做到丰产丰收，使广大农民一年辛勤劳动的果实全部拿到手。
    现在，粮食、棉、油料、烟、麻和土特产品的采摘和收购已经进入旺季。为了保证今年农业的丰收果实全部到手，为了完成今年的农产品收购任务，各地党委必须根据中共中央和国务院今天发布的“关于突击完成农产品收购调运任务的紧急指示”的精神，立即把当前的主要工作做一全面安排，认真做好劳力的筹划和调度，在大搞钢铁生产、深翻秋种的同时，加强对粮食、油料、棉、烟、麻和其他重要土特产品的收获、采摘、加工、收购、调运工作的领导，充分发动群众，把这些工作迅速开展起来。必须指出，这一工作做得好坏，不仅直接关系着今年的大丰收和能否争取明年更大的丰收，而且关系到城市工矿区和出口物资的供应，意义是十分重大的。
    为了实现“快收、多收、收好、收足”的采购方针，在农、副产品的收购战线上，也必须是党委挂帅，领导干部亲自出马，组成一个以人民公社为主的有广大妇女、儿童、学生、职工参加的收获、采摘、收购大军，开展群众性的收购和调运运动。今年农、副产品的收购数量比往年更大、更集中，特别是当前应采未采、应收未收、应运未运的农副产品数量很大，任务非常繁重，时间十分紧迫。但是，只要我们加强领导，发动群众，大家动手，形成运动，并根据各种产品的采摘季节，全面规划，采用大运动套小运动的办法，把中心工作和一般工作有机地结合起来，有节奏地穿插起来，组织几次突击采购和调运战役，就能够在保证元帅升帐的同时，多快好省地完成和超额完成国家的收购和调运任务。四川省在党委的统一安排下，利用钢铁和农业两大运动的空隙，采用突击的办法开展农副产品收购工作，使农副产品的收购工作有很大的进展。河南唐河县由县委书记挂帅，干部分片包干，全面安排劳力，组织摘棉大军，三次突击，共摘棉二千六百万斤，基本上做到了采摘适时。这些都是适合当前农村新形势的一种新的采购方法，值得推广。
    问题很明显，全面安排劳力是一个极为重要的问题。现在早秋已经收完，深耕任务亦将完成，特别是农村人民公社化的实现，都是统一安排劳力和组织采摘、出售和收购农副产品大军的有利条件。各地可以抽调一部分固定劳力来担负粮食、油料、棉烟麻的采摘、加工、运输等工作，和开展某些大宗的土副产品的采摘、收购工作，以保证工业生产跃进所需原料和出口物资的供应，支持今冬明春更大规模的水利建设的需要。
    根据人民公社化的新形势，今年农副产品的采购工作必须充分发动群众、依靠人民公社来进行。目前有不少地区实行由人民公社自行过秤，自行分级、打包，自行结算，自行保管或直送加工厂（或国家仓库）的“四自”方法，不仅大大地节省了劳力，降低了费用，而且也提高了产品的质量，加快了收购进度。这种办法对人民公社和国家都有利，应当大力推广。在推行中，商业部门必须特别注意加强技术指导和传授。
    此外，要做好农、副产品的采购工作，还必须注意解决加工、包装、运输、保管等问题。解决这些问题，同样需要依靠群众，特别是在劳力紧张的情况下，应充分发挥群众大搞技术革新，改革生产工具，推广先进经验，尽量做到随摘、随收、随加工、随调运。
    为了满足人民公社出售农产品以后购买生产资料和生活资料的需要，为了指导人民公社和公社社员合理使用出售农产品以后所得到的货款，商业部门和金融部门还必须做好农村的物资供应和储蓄存款等工作。把工业品迅速地运往农村，以支持农产品采购工作；把粮食、副食品工业原料迅速地运到城市、工矿区，以保证城市、工矿区的物资供应，这是当前国民经济中一项迫切的任务。各地要在钢铁、煤炭运输中间插上工农业产品的突击运输，把突击运输和经常运输结合起来；把现代运输工具和民间运输工具结合起来；要组织一切可以组织的力量（包括机关、团体、学校、居民的运输力量），充分利用一切回空的车辆和船舶，千方百计地完成调运任务。
