    A Moment of Thrill and Danger

    The third tap of the steel had just sounded, and Master Worker Ma Haiqing rushed to the tapping hole and opened it. Instantly, sparks of molten steel splashed, reddening half the sky.

    Suddenly, someone shouted, "It's bad! The waist door is leaking steel!" As soon as the words fell, a stream of molten steel broke through the waist door eye and flowed straight to the bottom of the furnace. At this critical moment, the heroic Communist Party member Comrade Ma Haiqing stepped forward bravely, rushed forward, braved temperatures above a thousand degrees, grasped the iron crowbar tightly with both hands, inserted it into the waist door eye, stepped on the crowbar with his foot, and refused to relax, even unto death.

    At this moment, the area around the tapping trough was already a sea of fire. The Party Branch Secretary of the workshop rushed forward and led the comrades to repair the furnace, and some comrades carried over steel ladles to receive the molten steel. The molten steel flowed more and more fiercely, and the temperature became higher and higher. On Ma Haiqing's head, beads of sweat the size of soybeans dripped down. His clothes were scorched and smoking. The Party Branch Secretary tried to replace him several times, but he resolutely refused. Like a steel giant, he stood firmly beside the tapping trough, motionless, until the last drop of molten steel flowed out of the furnace, and then he put down the crowbar.

    The workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 4 furnace all remember this thrilling moment and the heroic deed of Communist Party member Comrade Ma Haiqing in risking his life to save the molten steel.

    惊险的时刻
    第三次出钢钟刚敲过，马海清老师傅飞快地跑到出钢口前打开出钢眼。立时钢花飞溅，染红了半边天。
    忽然有人高喊一声：“不好了！腰门眼子漏钢了！”话音刚落，就见有一股钢水穿破腰门眼子一直往炉底泻去。在这紧要关头，英勇的共产党员马海清同志挺身而出，飞步向前，冒着千度以上的高温，双手握紧铁撬杠，插进腰门眼子，用脚踩住撬杠，死也不肯放松。
    此刻，出钢槽周围已是一片火海。车间党支部书记赶上前来，领着同志们修炉子，还有一些同志抬过盛钢桶来接钢水。钢水越流越猛，热度越来越高。马海清头上，豆粒大的汗珠直往下淌。衣服烤焦了，直冒青烟。党支书几次要替换他，他都坚决不肯。像一个钢铁巨人一样，屹立在出钢槽旁，纹丝不动，直到炉里流完最后一滴钢水，他才放下撬杠。
    重庆钢铁公司四号炉的职工们，都记着这个惊险的时刻，记着共产党员马海清同志这种冒险抢救钢水的英勇事迹。
