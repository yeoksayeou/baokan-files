Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement on Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to compatriots in Taiwan, the text of which is as follows:

	We fully support the suggestion in the letter from our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai to compatriots in Taiwan to hold negotiations and implement a peaceful resolution. We believe this provides the best opportunity for the KMT military and government personnel in Taiwan to seek a way out.

	Taiwanese military and government personnel should know that Taiwan has long been impoverished, its soldiers weary, and Kinmen and Matsu are even more devoid of ammunition and food, facing imminent danger. Relying on the islands of Taiwan to resist stubbornly will ultimately lead to a dead end. The United States is both unreliable and untrustworthy. Its aggressive actions have aroused the anger of people around the world; it is truly like a clay ox crossing the sea, unable to protect itself, and will eventually abandon you. Therefore, the situation facing the Taiwanese military and government personnel is very clear: clinging to American imperialism and stubbornly resisting will result in either being sacrificed or perishing together; holding negotiations and implementing a peaceful resolution is the only way out.

	The KMT military and government personnel in Taiwan still recognize themselves as Chinese. If you are Chinese, you should love China and join us in opposing American imperialist aggression and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Time waits for no one, and opportunities are rare. We sincerely hope that the KMT military and government personnel in Taiwan can reflect on the past, face reality, and promptly accept Minister Peng Dehuai's suggestion, and not miss this opportunity.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The responsible person of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued a statement on Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to compatriots in Taiwan, the text of which is as follows:

	We, the China Democratic League, fully support the letter to compatriots in Taiwan issued by our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai. The letter to compatriots in Taiwan fully expresses the deep concern of the mainland compatriots for the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and also conforms to the requirements and aspirations of the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

	American imperialism is our enemy. We, the mainland compatriots, cannot tolerate the American imperialists occupying our territory of Taiwan and trampling on the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu; the time has come for the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu to settle their blood debts with the American imperialists. Let us unite, point our guns outward, drive out the invaders, and defend our motherland, defend peace in the Far East and the world.

	Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland's socialist construction is advancing by leaps and bounds, shining brilliantly. All Chinese compatriots with a little sense of national pride and patriotism are jubilant and encouraged by this. Therefore, we hope that the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu can respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call with practical actions, hold negotiations as soon as possible, and realize a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, so that our military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu can return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible and join the people of the whole country in building a prosperous, strong, glorious, and great new China.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The spokesperson of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a statement on Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to compatriots in Taiwan, the text of which is as follows:

	The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League fully supports the letter to compatriots in Taiwan issued by Minister Peng Dehuai. This document correctly points out that the only way out for the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu is: "Of the thirty-six stratagems, reconciliation is the best." Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territory, not American territory; they are part of China, not another country. We resolutely oppose American imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and resolutely oppose the United States occupying Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and interfering in our internal affairs. Today, under the situation where the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind, American imperialism is unprecedentedly isolated. The Chiang Kai-shek clique should realize that following American imperialism will only lead to a dead end. Only by accepting Minister Peng Dehuai's suggestion and holding negotiations to implement a peaceful resolution is there a single way out.

    台澎金马军民同胞的唯一出路
    举行和平谈判　赶走美国强盗
    民革、民盟、台盟负责人拥护国防部长彭德怀告台湾同胞书
    新华社6日讯　中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话，文如下：
    我国防部长彭德怀告台湾同胞书中，建议举行谈判实行和平解决，我们完全拥护。我们认为这是给了台湾国民党军政人员自求生路的一个最好机会。
    台湾军政人员应该知道，台湾早已民穷财尽，师老兵疲，金门、马祖更是弹尽粮绝，朝不保夕，凭借台湾各岛负隅顽抗，终归是死路一条。美国是既不可靠，也靠不住的。它的侵略行动，已经激起了全世界人民的愤怒，真是泥牛过海，自身难保，迟早总要丢掉你们的。所以摆在台湾军政人员面前的形势很明显：依附美帝国主义负隅顽抗，结果不是被人牺牲就是同归于尽；举行谈判，实行和平解决，才是唯一的生路。
    台湾的国民党军政人员总还承认自己是中国人。是中国人就应该爱中国，就应该同我们一道反对美帝国主义的侵略，反对它制造两个中国的阴谋。时不待人，机会难再，我们恳切希望台湾国民党军政人员能够想想过去，正视现实，及时接受彭德怀部长的建议，慎勿坐失良机。
    新华社6日讯　中国民主同盟中央负责人就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话，文如下：
    我们中国民主同盟完全拥护我国国防部长彭德怀发表的告台湾同胞书。告台湾同胞书充分表达了大陆同胞对台、澎、金、马军民同胞的深切关怀，也符合于台、澎、金、马军民同胞的要求和愿望。
    美帝国主义是我们的敌人。我们大陆同胞不能容忍美帝侵占我国领土台湾和对台、澎、金、马军民同胞的蹂躏；台、澎、金、马军民同胞对于美帝的血泪仇也到了清算的时候。让我们团结一致，枪口对外，赶走侵略者，保卫祖国，保卫远东和世界和平。
    我们祖国在中国共产党领导之下，社会主义建设事业正在突飞猛进，光芒万丈。凡属稍有民族感和稍有爱国心的中国同胞，莫不为之欢欣鼓舞。因此，我们希望台、澎、金、马军民同胞们能以实际行动，响应彭德怀部长的号召，尽速举行谈判，实现和平解决台湾问题，使我台、澎、金、马军民同胞们能够尽早回到祖国怀抱，同全国人民一道，来共同建设繁荣富强、光荣伟大的新中国。
    新华社6日讯　台湾民主自治同盟发言人就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话，文如下：
    台湾民主自治同盟完全拥护彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书。这一文告正确地指出了台、澎、金、马军民同胞唯一的出路是：“三十六计，和为上计。”台、澎、金、马是中国的领土，不是美国的领土，是中国的一部分，不是另一个国家。我们坚决反对美帝国主义制造两个中国的阴谋，坚决反对美国侵占台、澎与台湾海峡，干涉我国内政。今天在东风继续压倒西风的形势下，美帝国主义空前孤立，蒋介石集团应该认识到跟着美帝国主义只有死路一条。只有接受彭德怀部长的建议，举行谈判实行和平解决才是唯一的活路。
