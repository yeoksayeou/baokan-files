Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Mass movements of people from all walks of life throughout Japan are resolutely opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the implementation of the reactionary "Performance Evaluation" system.

The Western Regional Council of the National Railway Workers' Union and the Western Regional Council of the National Railway Locomotive Union held mass meetings today at various workplaces to express their opposition to the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

More than 1,800 workers in the Hiratsuka area of Kanagawa Prefecture held a citizens' rally in Hiratsuka City on the 24th to oppose the revision of the Police Law.

On the same day, approximately 500 union members in Yokosuka and 500 union members in Utsunomiya City also held meetings and passed resolutions expressing their opposition to the government's revision of the Police Law.

The Faculty of Education of Gunma University held a student assembly on the afternoon of the 24th and decided to hold a strike on October 27th and 28th to express opposition to the government's revision of the Police Law and to demand that the government not implement the "Performance Evaluation" system. The assembly also decided to appeal to citizens from the 25th onwards to oppose the government's revision of the Police Law.

The Hyogo Prefecture High School Teachers and Staff Union held an extraordinary meeting on the 24th and decided to stop classes from noon on the 28th to participate in protest rallies held in six locations including Kobe and Himeji to express opposition to the revision of the Police Law and the implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system. The Nara Prefecture Student Self-Government Association Federation also held a protest rally in Nara City on the 24th, attended by students from three universities including Nara Women's University. After the assembly, participants held a demonstration in the city, appealing to citizens to oppose the revision of the Police Law and the implementation of the "Performance Evaluation" system.

The Japan Christian Council, with 1,500 participating churches, issued a statement at its 10th General Assembly in Tokyo on the 24th opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's police law amendment. The statement said, "This amendment seeks to restore the suppression of religious belief that occurred during the war."

The Committee on Protecting Academic and Intellectual Freedom of the Autumn Assembly of the Science Council of Japan held a meeting on the 23rd. The meeting pointed out that some provisions of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" currently under deliberation in the Japanese Diet could infringe upon fundamental human rights and even suppress academic and intellectual freedom.

The committee decided to submit a written opinion to the Kishi Nobusuke government, requesting it to carefully consider the bill during its handling.

The chairman of the committee, Tokuzo Aoki, stated that incidents such as police officers searching academic research institutions, the Vice-Minister of Education issuing a notice regarding the implementation of a "Performance Evaluation" system for university professors, and the government recently submitting the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" to the Diet, show that protecting academic and intellectual freedom is now more necessary than at the end of the war. Moreover, protecting academic and intellectual freedom has become extremely difficult.

Just as people from all walks of life in Japan are rising up to oppose the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, at a meeting of Diet members convened by the Liberal Democratic Party on the 24th, asked the Diet members to cooperate and strengthen party unity" so that the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" would definitely be passed at this Diet session.

At the same time, the National Railway authorities unreasonably handed a letter of warning to the National Railway Workers' Union and the National Railway Locomotive Union on the 24th, prohibiting them from taking actions such as holding workplace rallies to oppose the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," and ordering managers of all branch companies and directors of railway administrations to "severely punish" employees participating in such activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: "Akahata" published an editorial on the 25th calling on the whole party to unite all democratic forces, develop the people's united struggle, and strive to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The editorial pointed out that, judging from the current serious situation and the nature of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is an absolutely necessary condition for achieving victory in the people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards.

The editorial said that the Japanese Communist Party is determined to actively support the Socialist Party's declaration to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, to develop a people's movement to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet together with the Socialist Party, and to stand at the forefront of this movement to carry out the struggle.

The editorial pointed out that the people's anger at the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" is developing widely and deeply. The situation in which a small number of reactionaries, aided by U.S. imperialism, are in open conflict with the broad masses of the people is developing rapidly. Advanced elements among the people have seen through the militaristic, traitorous, and reactionary nature of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet and have begun to demand its overthrow. With political propaganda and correct leadership, there is a great possibility that the broad masses of the people will rise up to carry out a united struggle to deal with the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The decisive factor in this is to unite all democratic forces. The editorial said that the Japanese Communist Party believes that there is only one true path to overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet: to unite all democratic forces and develop the people's united struggle.

The editorial called on the whole party to mobilize the people to combine the struggle against the revision of the Police Law with other major struggles, and to carry out struggles related to the Taiwan Strait issue, the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and opposition to industrial rationalization; and called on the people to carry out a united struggle to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.
