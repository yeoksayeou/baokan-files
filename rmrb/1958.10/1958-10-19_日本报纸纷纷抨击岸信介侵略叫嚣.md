Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: Japanese major newspapers have successively published commentaries, strongly condemning Nobusuke Kishi's remarks to American reporter Brown regarding the revival of Japanese militarism.

    The "Yomiuri Shimbun" pointed out in a commentary on the 17th that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks prove that China's accusation that the Kishi Nobusuke government is an imperialist government with ambitions and attempts to revive the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is not without basis, but a reliable fact.

    The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also pointed out in an editorial that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks will further deteriorate relations between Japan and China.

    The editorial said that, just as the Japanese Socialist Party condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government, Japan will henceforth voluntarily promote the establishment of a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" system, which is a dangerous thing that the Japanese people could never have dreamed of. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also said that Kishi Nobusuke said he intended to comprehensively revise the constitution, which exposed his true intentions.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" criticized Kishi Nobusuke in a short commentary on the 17th as a person who defends Dulles. It said that we urgently feel that Japanese politics cannot be entrusted to a figure like Kishi Nobusuke.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" also stated in an editorial that the Japanese people will never tolerate Japan's return to the pre-war state. The newspaper also demanded the complete elimination of acts that undermine democratic politics.

    The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial on the 17th, expressing deep concern about Kishi Nobusuke's remarks. It pointed out that the part of the conversation concerning the China issue especially surprised us.

    日本报纸纷纷抨击岸信介侵略叫嚣
    新华社18日讯　日本各大报相继发表评论，强烈谴责岸信介对美国记者布朗所发表的复活日本军国主义的谈话。
    “读卖新闻”17日在一篇评论中指出，岸信介的谈话证明，中国指责岸信介政府是有帝国主义野心的政府并企图复活“大东亚共荣圈”，这并不是没有根据的，而是可靠的事实。
    “读卖新闻”又在社论中指出，岸信介的谈话将使日中两国关系更加恶化。
    社论说，正如日本社会党谴责岸信介政府那样，日本从此将自愿推进建立“东北亚军事同盟”的体系，这是日本人民梦想不到的危险的事情。“读卖新闻”还说，岸信介说他有意全面修改宪法，这暴露了他的真心本意。
    “朝日新闻”17日的短评指责岸信介是杜勒斯辩护的人。它说，我们迫切感到，日本的政治是不能委托像岸信介这样一个人物的。
    “朝日新闻”还在社论中表示，日本人民绝不容忍日本恢复战前的状态。报纸并且要求彻底排除破坏民主政治的行为。
    “每日新闻”在17日发表社论，对岸信介的谈话表示深刻的忧虑。它指出，谈话中关于中国问题的部分尤其使我们大吃一惊。
