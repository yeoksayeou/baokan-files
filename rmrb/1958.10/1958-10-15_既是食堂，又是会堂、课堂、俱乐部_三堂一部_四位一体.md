Simultaneously a Dining Hall, Meeting Hall, Classroom, and Club
"Three Halls and One Department" as a Unified Whole
 社员 of the Sishui People's Commune Praised:
　　Eating and reading newspapers, knowing current affairs,
　　Arranging production is timely and thorough.
　　Singing ditties, morale is even higher,
　　Harvesting day and night, feeling no fatigue.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: The Sishui People's Commune in Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, utilizes collective dining halls to carry out cultural activities, making the dining hall simultaneously a meeting hall, classroom, and club. The peasants call it "Three Halls and One Department." This method ensures that cultural and propaganda education work in the commune can still be persisted with even under the tense circumstances of the autumn harvest and planting.

The "Three Halls and One Department" cultural activities of the Sishui Commune have lively and rich content. People can see a blackboard at the entrance when entering the dining hall of the first team, second platoon, and third platoon of the Suli Brigade of this commune, with a few lines of large characters written on it: "Our Great Leap Forward team has launched a large satellite, harvesting a total of 68,744.4 jin of rice from twelve mu of land, with an average yield of 5,728 jin per mu. Let's work harder and strive to go to Beijing." Inside the dining hall, the tables and stools are neat and tidy, and clean. On a larger wall, there are special columns on the wall newspaper for commendations, criticisms, challenges, good news, questions and answers, storytelling, and riddles. The rest of the walls, pillars, and beams are also covered with dazibao [big-character posters], which are colorful and dazzling. One dazibao commending female commune member Lü Heying wrote: "Production model Lü Heying, everyone smiles when mentioning her, she is not afraid of any difficulties, and takes the lead in everything. She rushes to harvest rice day and night, and can be called a good party member of a martyr's family." Another dazibao is from commune member Tan Suzhen criticizing her husband, Ma Bugao: "Ma Bugao, is chronically slow, he is absent-minded when working. I urge him, but he is not in a hurry, and scolds me when I get angry."

In addition to dazibao and wall newspapers, "Three Halls and One Department" also makes use of the time when commune members are waiting for meals to read newspapers, teach songs, and tell kuaiban [clapper talks], and uses the time after meals to hold short meetings to arrange production tasks. Through the "Three Halls and One Department," the commune members' eating, entertainment, learning, and meetings are well organized.

Now this commune has established 246 such "Three Halls and One Department" facilities. The commune members are satisfied and praised: "Three Halls and One Department, the method is really good; eating and reading newspapers, knowing current affairs, learning culture, opening the mind; arranging production, timely and thorough; singing ditties, morale is even higher; harvesting day and night, feeling no fatigue." This pioneering creation of "Three Halls and One Department" not only facilitates the cultural activities of commune members, but also solves the current difficulties of insufficient housing in the commune and the lack of suitable locations for clubs to carry out activities.

    既是食堂，又是会堂、课堂、俱乐部
    “三堂一部”四位一体
          汜水人民公社社员赞道：
    吃饭读报　时事知晓　布置生产　及时周到
    唱唱小调　干劲更高　日夜抢割　不觉疲劳
    新华社南京14日电　江苏宝应县汜水人民公社利用集体食堂开展文化活动，使食堂成为既是会堂、课堂，又是俱乐部。农民们把它叫做“三堂一部”。这种办法保证了在秋收秋种紧张的情况，仍能坚持公社的文化和宣传教育工作。
    汜水公社的“三堂一部”文化活动，内容生动、丰富。人们走进这个社的苏立大队一连二排和三排的食堂，就可以看到大门口挂着一块黑板报，上书几行大字：“我们跃进组放出一颗大卫星，十二亩地共收稻六万八千七百四十四斤四两，平均亩产五千七百二十八斤，大家再努力，争取上北京。”食堂里桌子凳子整整齐齐，干干净净。在一块较大的墙壁上，有墙报的表扬、批评、挑应战、好消息、问答、说故事、猜谜语等专栏，其余的墙壁和柱子、横梁上，也到处贴满了大字报，红红绿绿，琳琅满目。有一张表扬女社员吕鹤英的大字报写道：“生产模范吕鹤英，人人提她笑盈盈，什么困难她不怕，样样事情走在先，连日带晚赶割稻，称得上烈属好党员。”还有一张大字报是社员谭素珍批评她的丈夫马步高的：“马步高，死慢症，做起活来会发楞，我催他来他不急，催起火来还训我一大顿。”
    除了大字报、墙报外，“三堂一部”里还利用社员们等饭的时候读报、教歌、说快板，利用吃饭后的时间，开简短的布置生产任务的小会。通过“三堂一部”，把社员们吃饭、娱乐、学习、开会等很好地组织起来了。
    现在这个公社已经建立了二百四十六个这样的“三堂一部”。社员们满意地称赞道：“三堂一部，办法真好；吃饭读报，时事知晓，学习文化，开了心窍；布置生产，及时周到；唱唱小调，干劲更高；日夜抢割，不觉疲劳。”这种“三堂一部”的创举，不但便于公社社员的文化活动，而且还解决了目前公社房屋不够、俱乐部无适当地点开展活动的困难。（附图片）
    叔叔，瞧它也是多面手了！
