Dear Comrades and Friends:

Today, on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the establishment of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association by the Chinese people will greatly promote the ever-developing and deepening brotherly relations between China and Hungary. This is a matter of great honor and excitement for the Hungarian people. And choosing to establish it at this time is the best initiative.

The Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association, along with the friendship associations China has established with other fraternal countries, is a great victory. It is a great victory for the internationalist spirit demonstrated by the Chinese people, who are going all out and striving for the upper reaches to build socialism, and for the ever-strengthening internationalism of the proletarians of all countries.

The friendship between our two peoples, and the internationalism of the Chinese people, demonstrated its full power in a dangerous moment, namely when the counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by imperialism and its running dogs in October 1956 attempted to place Hungary under fascist slavery. The People's Republic of China, like the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, was one of the first countries to provide support to the Hungarian people and gave invaluable political, moral, and economic assistance to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian people. This assistance was one of the important factors in the rapid suppression of the Hungarian counter-revolution, the normalization and stabilization of domestic life, and the Hungarian people's firm and enthusiastic construction of a socialist society under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party. For this assistance, the Hungarian people express gratitude and respect to the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries.

The American imperialists suffered a shameful defeat in Hungary. They have met the same fate in their war provocations in the Middle East, Near East, and Indonesia. All this fully proves that even in the face of small or economically underdeveloped countries, as long as they resolutely fight for their freedom, relying on the selfless friendship of the socialist world and all peace-loving people, the American imperialist paper tiger is not to be feared.

However, the American monopoly capitalists, who attempt to control the world, have not yet awakened, despite repeated failures. Now we can see how these adventurers are digging their own graves. They constantly and shamelessly interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, and carry out war provocations against the Chinese people. But the great Chinese people, with the united support of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world, are determined to defend their rights and recover every inch of land seized by American imperialism. If the invaders dare to invade, the Chinese people are prepared to give them a fatal blow.

Our people are watching with sympathy the struggle of the Chinese people against the provocations of our common enemy in the Taiwan Strait. The Hungarian people and government fully support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands.

We are currently facing a situation in which the star of imperialism is beginning to fall, while the forces of socialism are developing on a world scale. The current situation of the Great Leap Forward in the People's Republic of China particularly powerfully demonstrates the growth of the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Comrades! Your achievements are an example for the Hungarian people, and these achievements inspire our people and the people of all socialist countries. The work of each of us draws strength from this. Your achievements also strengthen the entire socialist camp, bring the solidarity of the countries of the socialist camp closer, and enhance the confidence of the people of all countries fighting against imperialist rule, for freedom and peace, in their own strength and future.

The establishment of the Sino-Hungarian Friendship Association fills the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian working people with joy and excitement. I firmly believe that the work of this association will greatly contribute to the further development of relations between our two peoples, to the further consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp, and to the final victory of Marxism-Leninism. On behalf of the Hungarian people, the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and myself, I congratulate the newly established association on achieving the above-mentioned goals.

I wish the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples prosperity and development, and may it last forever!

### 中匈人民友谊万古长青  匈牙利驻华大使诺格拉第的讲话

    中匈人民友谊万古长青
    匈牙利驻华大使诺格拉第的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    今天，在伟大的中华人民共和国建国九周年的前夕，由于中国人民建立了中匈友好协会，把日益发展、日益加深的中匈两国兄弟关系更向前大大推进了。这是匈牙利人民感到非常荣幸、非常兴奋的事情。而选择在这个时候成立，这个崇高倡议是再好不过的了。
    中匈友好协会和中国与其它兄弟国家建立的友好协会是伟大的胜利，是正在鼓足干劲、力争上游建设社会主义的中国人民所表现的国际主义精神和世界各国无产阶级日益加强的国际主义的伟大胜利。
    我们两国人民的友谊，和中国人民的国际主义，在危险的时刻，即当帝国主义及其走狗所发动的1956年10月反革命暴乱企图把匈牙利置于法西斯主义奴役之下的时候，表现了它的全部威力。中华人民共和国，同苏联及其他人民民主国家一样，是最先给予匈牙利人民支持的国家之一，并且给了匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利人民以不可估价的政治、道义和经济上的援助。这种援助是匈牙利反革命被迅速消灭，国内生活正常化和稳定，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党领导下坚定热情地建设社会主义社会的重要因素之一。为了这个援助，匈牙利人民向伟大的苏联，向中华人民共和国及其他的社会主义国家表示感激和敬意。
    美帝国主义者在匈牙利遭到了可耻的失败。他们在中东、近东和印度尼西亚所进行的战争挑衅也遭到了同样的命运。这一切充分证明，即使在一些小的或者经济上不发达的国家的面前，只要他们坚决为自己的自由而奋斗，依靠社会主义世界和所有爱好和平的人民大公无私的友谊，美帝国主义这个纸老虎，也不可怕。
    然而，企图控制全世界的美国垄断资本家，虽然屡遭失败，至今仍执迷不悟。现在我们可以看到，这些冒险者如何自取灭亡。他们不断地无耻地干涉中华人民共和国内政，对中国人民进行战争挑衅但是伟大的中国人民，在全世界爱好和平和自由的人民一致支持下，决心保卫自己的权利，收回被美帝强占的每一寸土地。如果侵略者胆敢进犯，中国人民准备给其以致命的打击。
    我国人民怀着同情注视着中国人民为反对我们共同敌人在台湾海峡的挑衅所进行的斗争。匈牙利人民和政府全力支持中国人民为解放台湾和沿海岛屿而进行的正义斗争。
    我们目前面临着这样一种形势，即是帝国主义之星开始殒落，同时社会主义力量在世界规模的发展。目前中华人民共和国出现了大跃进的形势，这特别有力地证明以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的增长。同志们！你们的成就是匈牙利人民的榜样，这些成就鼓舞着我国人民和所有社会主义国家的人民。我们每个人的工作都从这里得到了力量。你们的成就同时也加强了整个社会主义阵营，使社会主义阵营各国之间的团结更加密切，增强了为反对帝国主义统治、为自由与和平而进行斗争的各国人民对于自己的力量和未来的信心。
    中匈友好协会的成立使成千上万的匈牙利劳动人民充满欢欣鼓舞的心情。我坚信这个协会的工作对于我们两国人民之间的关系的进一步发展，对于社会主义阵营的团结的进一步巩固，对于马克思列宁主义的最后胜利将有很大的贡献。我以匈牙利人民、匈牙利工农革命政府以及我自己的名义，祝贺现在建立的协会达到上述的目的。
    祝中匈两国人民牢不可破的友谊繁荣发展，万古长青！
