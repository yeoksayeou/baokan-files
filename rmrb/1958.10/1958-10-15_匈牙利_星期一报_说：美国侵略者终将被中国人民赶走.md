    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 13th. Today, the "Monday News" pointed out in a short commentary that the American imperialists' aggression against China has intensified the situation in the Far East. American troops directly occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and use warships and aircraft to carry out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.

    The commentary pointed out that when Chiang Kai-shek bombed the mainland, the United States said this was a "Chinese civil war," but when China shelled Kinmen, the United States said that China directly harmed American interests and threatened international peace. But China has pointed out the root causes of the tense situation in the Far East and the solutions in front of world public opinion.

    The commentary emphasized that there are two issues here. One is that the Chinese civil war is still ongoing, and ending the civil war is a matter between the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek. China, whether by peaceful or military means, will eventually liberate its own territory and restore the integrity of its territory. The other is American aggression against Taiwan. The commentary said that the United States must either stop its acts of aggression, or eventually be driven out by the Chinese people.

    匈牙利“星期一报”说：
    美国侵略者终将被中国人民赶走
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　今天“星期一报”在一篇短评中指出，美帝国主义者对中国的侵略使远东局势尖锐化。美国的军队直接占领了台湾和澎湖列岛，利用军舰和飞机在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅。
    评论指出，在蒋介石轰炸大陆的时候，美国说这是“中国内战”，但是当中国炮轰金门的时候，美国则说什么中国直接损害了美国的利益，威胁国际和平。但是中国已经在全世界舆论面前指出了造成远东紧张局势的根源和解决的办法。
    评论强调说，这里有两个问题，一个是中国内战仍在进行，结束内战是中国人民和蒋介石之间的事情。中国不论是用和平的或者是武力的方法，最终一定要解放自己的领土，恢复自己领土的完整。另外一个是美国侵略台湾。评论说，美国或者是停止自己的侵略行为，或者是最终被中国人民赶出去。
