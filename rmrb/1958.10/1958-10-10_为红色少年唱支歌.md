    Sing a Song for the Red Youths
    Su Fang

    In the streets, we often come across groups of young people. They are like lively little birds, chirping and chattering incessantly, laughing. Their clear voices can be heard from dozens of steps away, as if proclaiming to people: We have inexhaustible vitality, we are growing vigorously!

    However, are they merely a group of carefree, talkative children? In the ranks of building the motherland, they are also a fighting force; in the era of the Great Leap Forward, they also emit their own heat and light!

    Autumn dusk. The gentle breeze occasionally carries the crisp sound of shouts: "Read all about it, the freshly published Beijing Evening News!" That's them—the young people. While carrying their schoolbags, they also carry newspapers, excitedly shouting. At this time of day, when they should be going home to eat a dinner prepared by their mother's own hands, they still tirelessly chase after the setting sun, wanting to do something more for the motherland in the short time before its remaining glow fades.

    Early in the morning, they appear before people again. By the side of the road, at the tram stop… they hold loudspeakers and shout loudly, like a collective poetry recitation: "Uncles and Aunts, please don't spit anywhere…" They do it meticulously, they do it seriously and earnestly, and the admiring and approving gazes cast upon them do not make them blush or timid. Yes, why should they blush or be timid? Isn't this precisely a glorious and pride-worthy thing?

    When people pass through the village entrance or the fields, they are often stopped by the young people. They point to the wooden sign hanging on the tree, asking you to recognize the words written on it, or asking you to sing a song. They are working for the literacy station. They raise their heads, their gazes so earnest and sincere, that you can't help but be moved, can't help but seriously recognize even the simplest of words, can't help but try your best to sing a song well. When you see them nodding in satisfaction and waving goodbye to you, you will also feel immense comfort and happiness.

    They, these young people growing up in a happy era, their thoughts are like wings soaring to the sky, flying lightly in the vastness, unrestrained and unfettered; they dare to think and dare to do! They use their clever hands to graft tomatoes and potatoes together, wanting the land to grow such strange "two-story" plants: tomatoes blooming and bearing fruit above ground, and potato tubers growing strong and fat underground! They boldly set up factories, using the simplest unglazed earthenware pots as iron-smelting furnaces, using the most ordinary fertilizer and greenstone powder instead of nitrogen raw materials, smelting pig iron. Their iron factory is named "Young Pioneers Iron Factory," this will forever be their pride and glory!

    They have sweated in various production and political movements, adding bricks and tiles to the construction of the socialist edifice. They are the new people of communism, red youths who surpass Gan Luo and Luo Cheng!

    Now they appear before me again. They are probably going to a Young Pioneer activity, they are lined up in neat straight rows, heads held high, taking firm steps, and marching forward singing "Socialism is Good." The red flag is fluttering in front, and the red scarves and red cheeks reflect each other. The singing is so high-spirited and full of confidence, it attracts me, moves me, and I can't help but echo in my heart and sing a song. I sing about them, these red youths as agile as falcons; I sing about the great motherland, the dear Party, it is they who have nurtured and cultivated such strong successors to communism!

    为红色少年唱支歌
    苏方
    在街头，我们经常会碰见三五成群的少年们。他们像活泼的小鸟，叽叽喳喳地不停嘴地说着，笑着。清朗的声音，几十步远以外都可以听到，它似乎在向人们宣告：我们有着永不涸竭的活力，我们正在蓬蓬勃勃地成长！
    然而，他们岂止是一群无忧无虑爱说爱闹的孩子吗？在建设祖国的行列里，他们也是一支战斗的队伍；在大跃进的年代里，他们也发射出了自己的热和光！
    秋日的黄昏。轻拂着的风不时会送来几声清脆的喊声：“买报瞧，刚出版的北京晚报。”那是他们——少年们。他们一边挎着书包，一边夹着报纸，兴冲冲地叫着。在这散学归去的时候，本来应该回家吃一顿妈妈亲手为他们准备的晚饭；然而，他们却仍然毫无倦意地追赶着那快要落山的太阳，想在它的余辉还未熄灭的短暂时光里，为祖国再做一些事情。
    清晨，他们又出现在人们面前了。在马路旁，在电车站……他们拿着喇叭筒大声喊着，像集体朗诵诗一样：“叔叔阿姨们，请不要随地吐痰……”他们做得一丝不苟，他们做得严肃认真，投射到他们身上的赞美和称许的目光，也不会使他们面红或胆怯。是的，为什么要面红或胆怯呢？难道这不正是光荣的、值得自豪的事情吗？
    人们走过村口、田头的时候，常常会被少年们拦住。他们指着挂在树上的木牌，请你认一认上面写的字，或者要求你唱一支歌。这是他们在为扫盲站工作。他们扬着头，目光是那样恳切诚挚，你不由得会被感动，不由得会认真地去认那即或是很简单的字，不由得会竭尽全力唱好一支歌。当你看到他们满意地点着头挥手向你说“再见”时，你也会感到无比的欣慰和快乐。
    他们，这些生长在幸福的年代的少年们，思想像生了冲霄的羽翼，在苍天阔海里轻快地翱翔，毫不拘谨，不受束缚；他们敢想又敢作！他们用灵巧的双手把西红柿和马铃薯嫁接在一起，要让土地长出这样奇异的“两层楼”植物：地面上西红柿开花结果，地底下马铃薯的块茎长得又壮又肥！他们大胆地办起了工厂，用最简陋的不上釉的沙罐作炼铁炉，用最平常的肥田粉和青翠石代替氮原料，炼出了生铁。他们的铁厂被命名为“红领巾铁厂”，这永远是他们的骄傲和光荣！
    他们在各项生产运动和政治运动中，流了自己的汗，为建设社会主义大厦添上一砖一瓦。他们是共产主义的新人，是赛过甘罗，赛过罗成的红色少年！
    现在他们又出现在我的面前了。是到什么地方去过队日吧，他们排成整齐的直直的一行，昂着头，跨着坚定的步子，唱着“社会主义好”的歌前进。红旗在前面招展，红领巾和红面颊辉映成一片。歌声是如此昂扬并且满怀自信，它吸引了我，震动了我，我心里也不禁应和着唱起一支歌来。我歌唱的是他们，是这些像鹰隼一样矫捷的红色少年们；我歌唱的是伟大的祖国，亲爱的党，是她们孕育培养出了这样坚强的共产主义接班人！
