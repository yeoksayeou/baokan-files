    Using Bayonets and Fraud to Rape African Public Opinion
    De Gaulle's "Referendum" Full of Dirty Tricks
    (Our newspaper's combined reports) The inside story of the "referendum" farce directed by De Gaulle in Algeria and French Africa has been thoroughly exposed by public opinion. More and more facts prove that De Gaulle relied on naked military suppression, intimidation, forgery, and political blackmail, among other barbaric and despicable methods, to impose a dictatorial "constitution" that maintained colonial rule on the people of Algeria and West Africa.

    Military Threat
    The first method used by De Gaulle was to mobilize hundreds of thousands of French colonial troops and military police to carry out large-scale suppression and military threats against local residents.

    According to Radio "Voice of the Algerian Republic," the French colonial army stationed in Algeria received the task months before the "referendum" to win this so-called "referendum battle" at all costs. After the "referendum" began, 500,000 to 600,000 French colonial troops and 170,000 military police and local troops were all dispatched to surround villages and urban residential areas, arrest everyone they saw, and load them onto trucks to transport them to polling stations. Because the number of troops was insufficient, the "referendum" farce in Algeria lasted for three days.

    The French colonialists carried out bloody massacres and suppression of resisting residents. They arrested thousands of residents who refused to vote and threw them into prisons and concentration camps. In Bergendum, French colonialists even opened fire on women holding protest demonstrations.

    Deception and Bribery
    De Gaulle's second method was to deceive, buy off, and bribe the local public.

    According to Madjhemout Diop, First Secretary of the African Independence Party, in Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, French colonialists bribed some religious leaders to get them to vote in favor of De Gaulle's "constitution."

    In the rural areas of French West Africa, French colonialists used specially selected peanut seeds to buy off farmers. Farmers who refused to vote were not given seeds by the authorities, and peanuts were the main income for local residents.

    Forgery and Blackmail
    De Gaulle's third method was to carry out blatant forgery and political blackmail.

    According to Madjhemout Diop, First Secretary of the African Independence Party, when the "referendum" was held in Dakar, the capital of French West Africa, the French colonialists issued two types of ballots, one with the word "agree" printed on it and the other with the word "disagree" printed on it. However, the French authorities only distributed some "disagree" ballots in the morning. By noon, they told people that the "disagree" ballots had been used up, and they could only get "agree" ballots. In this way, people had no choice but to vote "agree."

    Diop said that in rural areas, farmers were forced to vote and were only given "agree" ballots. No "disagree" ballots were issued.

    According to Bakari, Vice Chairman of the Niger Administrative Committee and Secretary-General of the "African People's Union," the French colonial authorities forged the voting results in many forest areas in Niger, where "the vast majority of voters opposed De Gaulle's constitution."

    Can't Deceive People
    However, De Gaulle's clumsy methods cannot deceive the people of Algeria and French Africa, nor can they deceive world opinion.

    A commentary by Radio "Voice of the Algerian Republic" pointed out that no lies can cover up the truth. If it were really the case that 97% of Algerians supported France, as De Gaulle and Salan and his ilk said, then why doesn't France withdraw its 600,000-strong army from Algeria? Why does Salan demand the dispatch of new reinforcements and talk about carrying out large-scale mopping-up operations?

    The Leadership Committee of the General Union of Black African Workers issued a statement saying: "Never in the history of our country has there been such a hypocritical election."

### 用刺刀和诈骗强奸非洲民意  戴高乐“公民投票”黑幕重重

    用刺刀和诈骗强奸非洲民意
    戴高乐“公民投票”黑幕重重
    本报综合报道　戴高乐在阿尔及利亚和法属非洲导演的“公民投票”丑剧的内幕，已经被公众舆论彻底揭穿了。根据越来越多的事实证明，戴高乐依靠赤裸裸的武力镇压、恫吓、伪造和政治讹诈等等野蛮和卑鄙的手法，把维持殖民统治的独裁“宪法”强加在阿尔及利亚和西非人民的头上。
    武力威胁
    戴高乐使用的第一个手法，就是动员法国数十万殖民军队和宪警，对当地居民进行大规模的镇压和武力威胁。
    据“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台揭露，在“公民投票”几个月以前，法国驻阿尔及利亚殖民军就接受了任务，要不惜一切代价打胜这场所谓“公民投票战役”。“公民投票”开始后，五、六十万的法国殖民军和十七万宪兵及地方部队全部出动，包围了村庄和城镇居民区，把见到的人都抓起来，装上卡车运到投票站去。由于军队人数不够，阿尔及利亚的“公民投票”丑剧搞了三天才演完。
    对于反抗的居民，法国殖民者进行了血腥的屠杀和镇压。他们把成千的拒绝前去投票的居民逮捕起来，投进监狱和集中营。在贝尔格登，法国殖民者对举行抗议示威的妇女竞开枪射击。
    欺骗收买
    戴高乐的第二个手法，就是对当地公众进行欺骗收买和贿赂。
    据非洲独立党第一书记马杰赫穆特·迪乌普揭露，在法属西非首府达喀尔，法国殖民者就贿赂了一些宗教界领袖，以使他们投票赞成戴高乐“宪法”。
    在法属西非的农村，法国殖民者用精选的花生种子来收买农民。对于拒绝投票的农民，当局都不给予种子，而花生是当地居民的主要收入。
    伪造和讹诈
    戴高乐的第三个手法，是进行明目张胆的伪造和政治讹诈。
    据非洲独立党第一书记马杰赫穆特·迪乌普揭露，在法属西非首府达喀尔举行“公民投票”时，法国殖民者发出两种选票，一种上面印有“赞成”字样，另一种上面印有“反对”字样。但是法国当局只是在早晨分发了一些“反对”票。到了中午就对人们说，“反对”票已经发完了，他们只可得到“赞成”票。这样，人们除了投“赞成”票以外就别无其他选择。
    迪乌普说，在农村，农民们是被迫去投票的，并且只发给他们“赞成”票。没有发“反对”票。
    据尼日尔行政委员会副主席、“非洲人民联盟”秘书长巴卡里揭露，法国殖民当局伪造了尼日尔国内许多森林地区的投票结果，那些地区“绝大多数的选民都反对戴高乐的宪法”。
    骗不了人
    但是，戴高乐的拙劣手法，不仅欺骗不了阿尔及利亚和法属非洲的人民，而且也蒙蔽不了世界舆论。
    “阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台的评论指出，一切谎言都无法掩盖真相，如果真的像戴高乐、萨兰之流所说有97％的阿尔及利亚人支持法国，那么法国为什么不把它那支六十万人的大军从阿尔及利亚撤走？萨兰又为什么要求增派新的援军并且大谈要进行大规模扫荡战呢？
    黑非洲总工会领导委员会发表声明说：“在我们国家的历史中，从来没有过这样虚伪的选举。”
