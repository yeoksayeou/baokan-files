Experiences in Leading the All-Round Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee

    1958 was a year of rapid development in agricultural production in Henan Province. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the 48 million people of Henan Province, like their brothers and sisters in other provinces and cities across the country, won a comprehensive bumper harvest in both summer and autumn after a year of intense fighting. The great leap forward in agricultural production promoted the great leap forward in industry and other tasks. Not only did agriculture launch "satellites," but also industrial production, centered on steel, launched "satellites" as well. In particular, after the realization of people's communes throughout the province in August, the combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the collectivization of life, the militarization of organization, and the combatization of action greatly accelerated the speed of socialist construction.

    The great leap forward in agricultural production in Henan began in the autumn of last year. Its development process can be roughly divided into four stages: First, the farmland water conservancy movement centered on overcoming water and drought disasters from last winter to this spring. A 15 million-strong labor force in the province, working hard for more than 200 days, completed 8.8 billion cubic meters of earth and stone at a rate of 330,000 mu per day, with a water storage capacity of more than 26.2 billion cubic meters, expanding the irrigated area by 82.54 million mu, basically realizing water conservancy. Second, the spring production movement centered on striving for a bumper wheat harvest. The province universally promoted "three fertilizers and five irrigations," applying more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, irrigating more than 100 million mu times, overcoming several wind and frost disasters, and eliminating wheat midges on 24 million mu of wheat, especially strengthening the late-stage management of wheat, resulting in a comprehensive bumper harvest in the summer. Third, the production movement to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the autumn. The province continuously overcame four rainstorms, basically without disasters, storing 18 billion cubic meters of water, ensuring the normal growth of crops; carried out the autumn field management movement with the "six no's" as the content, namely no weeds, no pests, no weak seedlings, no missing seedlings and broken ridges, no water and drought disasters, and no third-class seedlings; boldly carried out reform, expanding rice by 10 million mu, sweet potatoes by more than 10 million mu; vigorously grasped cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, and oilseeds; vigorously engaged in satellite fields and large-area high-yield; and comprehensively carried out agricultural tool improvement with rolling bearings as the center, with most areas of the province initially achieving semi-mechanization, which played a huge role in striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn. Fourth, at the same time as vigorously developing steel, the autumn harvest and planting movement centered on deep plowing of land is currently being carried out. The province's farmers are determined to plant all of this year's 80 million mu of wheat on deeply plowed land, laying a solid foundation for achieving a thousand-jin province for wheat in 1959.

    After a series of efforts, our province has achieved brilliant results in agricultural production. The total summer grain output was 22.6 billion jin, an increase of one and a half times over last year; the early autumn was 12.1 billion jin, an increase of two times over last year; the late autumn is expected to be 38 billion jin, an increase of more than two times over last year. The total grain output for the year is expected to reach more than 70 billion jin, an increase of more than two times over last year's 24.6 billion jin, equivalent to more than 60% of the total grain output of the first five-year plan. The average yield per mu this year is about 700 jin, an increase of more than two times over last year's 221 jin. The average grain per person is about 1,500 jin, an increase of nearly two times over last year's average of 513 jin per person. The total cotton output is expected to exceed 1 billion jin, with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the total output increased by two times over last year, and the yield per mu increased by 2.7 times over last year. The expected yield of flue-cured tobacco is about 600 jin, an increase of six times over last year; the total output is nearly 1 billion jin, an increase of more than seven times over last year. The expected peanut yield is 500 jin, an increase of 3.7 times over last year; the total output is more than 2 billion jin, an increase of more than three times over last year. The sesame yield is 100 jin, an increase of 2.2 times over last year; the total output is more than 400 million jin, an increase of 1.6 times over last year. In both the wheat and autumn seasons, many "satellites" have been launched and "marshals" have been promoted.

    Henan's high-speed development of agricultural production this year is unprecedented. This is a great victory for the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," and it is the result of the heroic and day-and-night struggle of the 48 million people of the province in response to Chairman Mao's great call to "work hard for three years to change the face"; it is a prominent manifestation of the great superiority of the further developed socialist system (the realization of people's communes). Due to the comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production, Henan Province has shed its label as a disaster area and a low-yield area; due to the comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, the people of our province have the strength, foundation, and conditions to realize the policy of combining industry and agriculture; due to the comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, the development of productive forces, the people have more rations, industrial grain, and necessary reserve grain, basically solving the grain problem. And these have created a material foundation for gradually achieving a well-fed and well-clothed standard; and created conditions for further accelerating socialist construction, achieving agricultural mechanization and electrification ahead of schedule, and actively transitioning to communist society.

    In the past year, in leading the great leap forward in agricultural production, we have the following experiences:

    1.  The great leap forward in agricultural production first depends on the leap forward in thought and the harvest of thought. In the past year, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, every corner, every link, and every department have consistently implemented and carried out the struggle between the two roads and the two methods from beginning to end. One victory after another in production, and one ideological victory after another. On the one hand, we struggled against right-leaning opportunists and people's right-leaning, conservative, backward, and selfish thoughts, and on the other hand, we struggled against nature, transforming nature, and marching towards nature. The more thoroughly we oppose right-leaning conservative thoughts, the more production will leap forward; the leap forward in production, in turn, promotes the leap forward in people's thoughts. The enemies of Henan on the production front are mainly the "pessimistic theories of production" spread by right-leaning opportunists. They said, "Henan has a large population and little land, the land is barren and the people are poor, the cultivation is rough, and there are disasters every year," with no confidence in increasing production and powerless against natural disasters. The people of Henan launched a fierce struggle against their reactionary arguments and erroneous thoughts. Through the whole-people rectification campaign and socialist education movement, great airing of views, great contending, big-character posters, great debates, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, thoroughly smashing the "pessimistic theories of production" spread by right-leaning opportunists. For example, in production and disaster relief, we criticized the erroneous line of simply relying on state relief, that disaster areas cannot engage in basic construction, and cannot leap forward; and established the correct line of relying on the collective, self-reliance, developing production, people will conquer nature, fundamentally controlling disasters, and eliminating disasters. Yingju Commune in Fengqiu County is a great red banner that has fundamentally controlled natural disasters and achieved a comprehensive leap forward from production and disaster relief. In water conservancy construction, we criticized the water control line of simply relying on the state, relying on large-scale, and simply discharging, and established the "storage, small-scale, mass" three-main policy, launching a whole-people water conservancy movement. In agricultural production, we criticized the arguments that can only progress gradually and cannot leap forward, can only be low-yield and cannot be high-yield, can only be high-yield in small areas and cannot be high-yield in large areas, can achieve high yield here but not there, do not believe in advanced experience, do not believe in high-yield, do not believe in bumper harvests, and doubt high-yield "satellites"; and established the communist style of believing that things are done by people, daring to think and dare to do, breaking superstitions, and liberating the mind, that any region, any crop, and any condition can achieve bumper harvests, can achieve high yield, can leap forward, and can launch "satellites." The fact that all kinds of crops have shed their low-yield hats this year is ironclad proof. In technological innovation and tool reform, in various measures to increase production, we strictly criticized the right-leaning thoughts of following the old ways and not daring to innovate boldly, as well as the thoughts of doubting inventions and creations, attacking the advanced, and not supporting the advanced. For example, in the deep plowing of land movement, someone said, "People live to ninety-nine, and have never seen the land deeply plowed to one and a half chi. If you want to deeply plow to one and a half chi, you can only harvest one dou per mu." After strictly criticizing this thought, a large-scale upsurge of deep plowing of land appeared, not only plowing fast but also plowing with good quality. The above facts show that if we do not achieve victory on the ideological front, if political thought is not in command, it is impossible to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture.

    2.  Strengthen the Party's leadership, unify thoughts, the secretary takes action, the whole Party mobilizes, with great determination, full of energy, and tight grip. The Party always stands at the forefront of the movement, actively supports advanced things, constantly criticizes and overcomes right-leaning conservative thoughts, and leads the broad masses of cadres and people forward. At different times, different fighting slogans are put forward, last winter we proposed: "Work hard this winter and spring to achieve water conservancy," in the spring we proposed "Achieve four, five, and eight ahead of schedule, and realize the ten-year plan in one year," after the wheat harvest we proposed "Go all out, advance victoriously, and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn," in order to constantly inspire the fighting spirit of the masses. In the people's commune movement, Party committees at all levels actively supported the demands of the masses and firmly led the masses forward, so that the province quickly realized communization. In addition, the victories of water conservancy movement, rice reform, tool reform and other works are inseparable from the leadership, determination and drive of Party organizations at all levels. Leaders at all levels and cadres who have been sent down to the countryside are universally taking the lead in conducting experimental fields. 70,000 to 80,000 cadres in the province who have gone down to the countryside and up to the mountains eat, live, and work with the masses, and universally create advanced experiences in the combination of cadres, technicians, and farmers, and the cadre experimental fields have mostly launched "satellites." In the agricultural production movement, the spirit of continuous revolution has been implemented from beginning to end, constantly putting forward new indicators and new tasks, so that the advanced become more advanced, the backward catch up with the advanced, and everyone leaps forward again and again. Organizations at all levels have gained a lot of experience in leading the comprehensive leap forward, mainly: visits and comparisons, on-site meetings, exhibitions, inviting in and sending out, organizing five-level cadre large-scale inspections and evaluations. In particular, we attach importance to mass creation, establish advanced banners, promote advanced experience, and lead the backward with the advanced, seeking balanced development of the movement. At the same time, the comprehensive leap forward is inseparable from the support of manpower and material resources from brother provinces, as well as humbly learning from the experience of neighboring provinces.

    3.  Freely mobilize the masses, believe in the masses in everything, rely on the masses in everything, fully exert the wisdom and strength of the masses, constantly organize mass movements, and continuously leap forward. In practice, we deeply experienced that the great airing of views, great contending, and big-character posters instructed by Chairman Mao "are the best forms of socialist democracy." What to air views on, what to contend, what to debate, if you don't believe it, go and see, if you don't understand it, debate it. Rely on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, implement the Party's class line, carry out the struggle between the two roads and the two lines, correctly handle the contradictions among the people, criticize and debate various right-leaning conservative thoughts and well-to-do middle peasants with capitalist thoughts, strengthen communist education, commend the advanced, drive the backward, constantly improve the work style of cadres, crack down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and protect the enthusiasm and production order of the masses. Various places have universally adopted on-the-spot airing of views and debates, sending big-character posters to the door, going to the door to rectify, material exhibitions, self-painting and self-speaking, large-scale disputes, small-scale disputes, fully promoting socialist democracy, distinguishing between right and wrong, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. This kind of airing of views and debates has become a habit of the masses, and is everywhere in meal yards and fields, truly becoming the driving force for promoting various tasks. All those who have advanced production increase indicators, specific measures, and can promptly discover and promote advanced technologies are the result of consulting with the masses in the form of representative meetings, symposiums, and Zhuge Liang meetings, concentrating mass wisdom, and following the mass line.

    In the movement, a large number of socialist activists who are both red and expert have been trained. They are the leaders in carrying out agricultural production increase movements and conducting socialist construction. They dare to boldly invent and create, dare to fight against various right-leaning conservative thoughts, and dare to boldly carry out technical revolution and innovation attempts; they have clear banners, active thoughts, charge forward, and are not afraid of failure. All the experimental fields, satellite fields, inventions and creations, and typical examples of ideological struggle were mostly done by these people. We must love and resolutely support these advanced figures and activists. This part of the population accounts for about 30% of the rural male and female labor force.

    The masses are full of energy in the great leap forward. Various places have universally adopted large-scale corps operations, combining labor and military affairs, and combining labor and study. Night is like day, and the moon is like the sun. Red flags flutter during the day, and bright lights are everywhere at night, fighting day and night, truly achieving: food and lodging to the field, office meetings to the field, nurseries to the field, agricultural tool repair to the field, livestock to the field, commodity supply to the field, learning to the field, and cultural entertainment to the field. Now a mass movement of vigorously developing steel, vigorously engaging in agricultural production increase, vigorously engaging in cultural and technical revolution, actively supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and accelerating socialist construction has formed in the countryside. Everywhere you can hear the songs: "Deeply plow the land to produce more grain, fiercely strike the American wolves" "Pour more steel water, strike the American devils."

    4.  The agricultural technology revolution, which includes the seven measures of water, fertilizer, soil, seed, density, agricultural tool reform, and field management, is a correct line for agricultural production and construction. Once this line is mastered by the broad masses, it produces the power to be invincible and conquer everything. It powerfully breaks the right-leaning conservative thoughts, breaks through the conventions, promotes agricultural technology reform, and guarantees a bumper harvest in agriculture. In the past year, the province's water conservancy irrigation area has expanded from the original 43 million mu to more than 111 million mu, an increase of nearly two times, which is more than eleven times that of before liberation. Not only has it overcome the drought of one hundred days without rain, but it has also basically eliminated water disasters. In the past, the average disaster area in the province was about 30 million mu per year. This year, under the condition that the rainfall is greater than in the past, only more than 2 million mu, including the Yellow River灘地, were affected by the disaster, reducing the disaster by more than 90%. In the past year, a total of more than 9 trillion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated, calculated according to the cultivated area, an average of 70,000 jin per mu. The base fertilizer for winter wheat this year is about 50,000 jin per mu, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased more than ten times compared with last year. Soil improvement and deep plowing have greatly developed. Last year, the wheat耕層 had already doubled, and the "satellite" field was耕深 one and a half chi or more. This year, the 耕層 of autumn crops has been improved again, and more than 20 million mu has been deeply plowed to one chi or more. All 80 million mu of winter wheat have been deeply plowed to one chi and two inches or more, and the "satellite" field has been deeply plowed to three chi or more. All kinds of crops have realized improved varieties, and all have been densely planted. The amount of wheat sown last year was 12 or 13 jin per mu, and this year it has increased to about 30 jin, and the "satellite" field is 50 jin or more per mu. The number of cotton and sweet potato plants has increased from about 2,000 per mu in the past to more than 3,000. The number of rice plants has generally increased from 7,000 or 8,000 clusters to more than 20,000 clusters, and some have reached 50,000 or 60,000 clusters. In the field management of various crops, the management has been regularized, and "the crop does not harvest, the management does not stop." Currently, the province is carrying out wheat planting work centered on deep plowing of land. This is a revolutionary movement to fight against the earth and turn the land over.

    5.  With the development of the great leap forward situation, communist ideas have been greatly developed, and communist large-scale cooperation has been widely developed. This is a new production relationship that has emerged in the great leap forward, and it is also a communist bud. The development of this new production relationship not only has a huge impetus for the bumper harvest in agriculture, but also has a very important significance for accelerating socialist construction, promoting the people's communes, and improving and cultivating the communist ideology and moral character of the broad masses. A new style of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" has appeared everywhere, everyone is striving to be upstream, and everything is done with greater, faster, better and more economical results. On the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, industry and agriculture are carried out simultaneously, industry and agriculture promote each other, comprehensive large-scale cooperation, galloping forward, racing against time, and accelerating construction. Last winter and this spring, in order to realize the great leap forward in production, the whole Party and the whole people, industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and the military twisted into a rope, breaking the boundaries between urban and rural areas, regional boundaries, and departmental boundaries, and supporting each other. In water control, there were 3 million people, and in the summer harvest and summer planting, there were 5 million people, leaving their hometowns, bringing their own rations, bringing their own tools, bringing their own livestock, bringing their own seeds and seedlings, carrying red flags, beating gongs and drums to support other places. This is a great manifestation of communist thought. Rural labor goes to the city and up to the mountains to vigorously develop steel, supporting industry; urban workers bring machines and technology to the countryside to support agriculture. Working as both workers and farmers and soldiers, everyone becomes a versatile player. This new type of urban-rural relationship, worker-peasant relationship, the relationship between the state and the commune, and the relationship between individuals and collectives is developing rapidly with the development of industrial and agricultural production.

    Henan, like the rest of the country, is in a great period of accelerating socialist construction and actively preparing conditions for the transition to communist society. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, the 48 million people of Henan are using the spirit of continuous revolution and the momentum of overwhelming the world to push the upsurge of socialist construction wave after wave. In the past year, although we have achieved a great victory on the agricultural production front, this is only the beginning, and a greater leap forward is still in 1959. We must not be satisfied with the status quo, we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, sum up local experience, humbly learn from foreign experience, go all out with greater effort, unite the whole Party and the whole people, and strive to consolidate and improve the people's communes and give full play to its incomparable superiority, and strive to complete and overfulfill the steel production plan; strive to fight the mountainous areas, vigorously develop river networking, fundamentally control water and drought disasters; strive to achieve a thousand-jin province for wheat and a greater bumper harvest throughout the year next year, fundamentally solve the grain problem, and vigorously support national construction. At present, the whole Party and the people of the province are fighting heroically with full confidence to complete this great and arduous task.

    领导农业生产全面跃进的体会
    中共河南省委书记处书记　史向生
    1958年是河南省农业生产飞跃发展的一年。河南省四千八百万人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，和全国各兄弟省市一样，经过一年的紧张战斗，赢得了夏秋两季全面大丰收。农业生产的大跃进促进了工业和其他各项工作的大跃进。不但农业上放“卫星”，以钢铁为中心的工业生产也大放“卫星”。尤其8月份全省实现人民公社化以后，工、农、商、学、兵互相结合，农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，生活集体化，组织军事化，行动战斗化，大大加快了社会主义建设的速度。
    河南农业生产大跃进是从去年秋季开始的。其发展过程大体可分为四个段落：一是去冬今春以战胜水旱灾害为中心的农田水利运动。全省一千五百万劳动大军，苦战二百余天，以每天三十三万亩的速度，共完成了土石方八十八亿公方，蓄水能力二百六十二亿多方，扩大灌溉面积八千二百五十四万亩，基本上实现了水利化。二是以争取小麦丰收为中心的春季生产运动。全省普遍推广了“三肥五水”，每亩追肥两万斤以上，浇地一亿多亩次，战胜了数次风霜灾害，消灭了二千四百万亩小麦上的吸浆虫，特别是加强了小麦的后期管理，获得了夏季全面大丰收。三是争取秋季全面大丰收的生产运动。全省连续战胜了四次暴雨，基本上没有发生灾害，蓄水一百八十亿方，保证了作物的正常生长；开展了以无杂草、无虫害、无瘦苗、无缺苗断垅、无水旱灾害、无三类苗的“六无”为内容的秋田管理运动；大胆进行改制，扩大水稻一千万亩，红薯一千多万亩；大抓棉花、烟叶、油料等经济作物；大搞卫星田和大面积高额丰产；并且以滚珠轴承为中心全面进行农具改良，全省大部地区初步实现了半机械化，这对争取秋季大丰收起了极大的作用。四是目前在大办钢铁的同时，开展了以深翻土地为中心的秋收秋种运动。全省农民决心把今年的八千万亩小麦全部种在深翻土地上，为实现1959年小麦千斤省打下坚实的基础。
    经过一系列的努力，我省在农业生产上，取得了辉煌成果。夏季粮食总产量二百二十六亿斤，比去年增产了一倍半；早秋一百二十一亿斤，比去年增产了两倍；晚秋预计三百八十亿斤，比去年增产两倍多。全年粮食总产量预计可达七百余亿斤，比去年二百四十六亿斤增产两倍还多，相当于第一个五年计划粮食产量总和的60％以上。今年平均亩产七百斤左右，比去年二百二十一斤增产两倍以上。每人平均粮食一千五百斤左右，比去年每人平均五百一十三斤增加将近两倍。棉花预计总产量将超过十亿斤，亩产可达百斤皮棉；总产比去年增产两倍，亩产比去年增产二点七倍。烤烟预计单产六百斤左右，比去年增产六倍；总产近十亿斤，比去年增产七倍多。花生预计单产五百斤，比去年增产三点七倍；总产量二十亿斤以上，比去年增产三倍多。芝麻单产一百斤，比去年增产二点二倍；总产四亿斤以上，比去年增产一点六倍。在麦秋两季，都有很多“卫星”上天和“元帅”升帐。
    河南今年农业生产高速度的发展，是亘古未有的。这是党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线的伟大胜利，是全省四千八百万人民响应毛主席“苦战三年，改变面貌”的伟大号召，日夜英勇奋战的结果；是进一步发展中的社会主义制度（实现人民公社化）的巨大优越性的突出表现。由于农业生产的全面丰收，河南省摘掉了灾区帽子，摘掉了低产帽子；由于农业的全面丰收，我省人民完全有力量、有基础、有条件实现工农业并举的方针；由于农业的全面丰收，生产力的发展，人民拥有较多的口粮、工业用粮和必要的储备粮，基本上解决了粮食问题。而这些都为逐步达到丰衣足食标准，创造了物质基础；为进一步加速社会主义建设，提前实现农业机械化和电气化，为积极向共产主义社会过渡创造了条件。
    一年来，在领导农业生产大跃进当中，我们有以下几点体会：
    一、农业生产大跃进，首先取决于思想跃进和思想丰收。一年以来，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，每个角落、每个环节、每个部门自始至终都贯彻与进行了两条道路、两种方法的斗争。生产上一个胜利接着一个胜利，思想胜仗也是一个接着一个。一方面向右倾机会主义者和人们的右倾、保守、落后、自私思想作斗争，一方面向自然作斗争，改造自然，向自然进军。对右倾保守思想反的越彻底，生产就越跃进；生产上的跃进，反转来又促进人们的思想跃进。河南在生产战线上的敌人，主要是右倾机会主义者所散布的“生产悲观论”，他们说：“河南人多地少，地瘠民贫，耕作粗糙，年年有灾”，“十年也解决不了粮食问题”，对增产毫无信心，对自然灾害无能为力。河南人民对他们这种反动论点和错误思想，针锋相对地展开了激烈的斗争。通过全民整风和社会主义教育运动，大鸣大放，大字报，大辩论，兴无灭资，大破大立，拔白旗，插红旗，彻底粉碎了右倾机会主义分子所散布的“生产悲观论”。譬如在生产救灾中，批判了单纯依靠国家救济、灾区不能搞基本建设、不能跃进的错误路线；树立了依靠集体，自力更生，发展生产，人定胜天，根治灾害，消灭灾害的正确路线。封丘县应举社就是从生产救灾中根治自然灾害，取得全面大跃进的一面大红旗。在水利建设中，批判了单纯依靠国家、依靠大型、单纯排泄的治水路线，树立了“蓄、小、群”三主方针，开展了全民办水利运动。在农业生产上，批判了只能渐进不能跃进，只能低产不能高产，只能小面积高产不能大面积高产，此处能高产彼处不能高产，不相信先进经验，不相信高额丰产，不相信大丰收，怀疑高产“卫星”等论调；树立事在人为、敢想敢干、破除迷信、思想解放的共产主义风格，不论什么地区、什么作物、什么条件都可以丰收，都可以高产，都可以跃进，都可以放出“卫星”。今年各种作物都摘掉了低产帽子，就是铁证。在技术革新和工具改革中，在各种增产施措中，严格批判了因循守旧、不敢大胆革新的右倾思想，以及怀疑发明创造、打击先进、不支持先进的思想。如深翻土地运动中，有人说：“人活九十九，没见过土地深翻一尺五，如要深翻一尺五，每亩只能打一斗”。在严格的批判了这种思想之后，就出现了热火朝天规模巨大的深翻土地高潮，不但翻的快而且翻的质量好。以上事实说明，如果不取得思想战线上的胜利，不是政治思想挂帅，要取得农业的大丰收是不可能的。
    二、加强党的领导，统一思想，书记动手，全党动员，决心大，劲头足，抓的紧。党不论在什么时候都是站在运动的最前列，积极支持先进事物，不断批判和克服右倾保守思想，带领广大干部和群众前进。在不同时期提出不同的战斗口号，去冬提出：“苦干一冬春实现水利化”，春季提出“提前实现四、五、八，十年规划一年实现”，麦收后提出“鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，争取秋季大丰收”，以不断鼓舞群众斗志。在人民公社化运动中，各级党委积极支持群众要求，坚定的领导群众前进，使全省很快实现了公社化，此外，如水利化运动、稻改、工具改革等工作的胜利，也都是和各级党组织的领导决心与干劲分不开的。各级领导和下放干部都以生产领导生产，普遍带头搞试验田。全省下乡上山的干部七、八万人，都与群众同吃同住同劳动，普遍创造了干部、技术人员、农民三者结合的先进经验，干部试验田并且大都放了“卫星”。在农业生产运动中，自始至终贯彻了不断革命的精神，不断提出新的指标和新的任务，使先进的更先进，后进的赶先进，大家跃进再跃进。各级组织在领导全面大跃进中，已经取得了不少经验，主要是：参观评比，现场会，展览会，请进来派出去，组织五级干部大检查大评比。特别是重视群众创造，树立先进旗帜，推广先进经验，以先进带后进，求得运动平衡发展。同时，全面大跃进是和兄弟省人力、物力的支援，以及虚心学习友邻省的经验分不开的。
    三、放手发动群众，一切相信群众，一切依靠群众，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，不断组织群众运动，连续跃进。在实践中我们深深体验到毛主席所指示的大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报“是社会主义民主的最好形式”。做什么鸣放什么、辩论什么，不信就看，不通就辩。依靠广大贫农下中农，贯彻执行党的阶级路线，开展两条道路和两条路线的斗争，正确处理人民内部矛盾，对于各种右倾保守思想和带有资本主义思想的富裕中农进行批判辩论，加强共产主义教育，表扬先进，带动落后，不断改善干部作风，打击地、富、反、坏的破坏活动，保护群众热情和生产秩序。各地普遍采取了就地鸣放辩论，送大字报上门，登门整改，实物展览，自画自讲，大争大辩，小争小辩，充分发扬社会主义民主，分清大是大非，调动群众积极性。这种鸣放辩论已成为群众习惯，饭场、地头到处皆有，真正成为推动各种工作的动力。凡是增产指标先进，措施具体，并能及时发现和推广先进技术的，都是运用代表会、座谈会、诸葛亮会等形式和群众商量，集中群众智慧，走群众路线的结果。
    在运动中培养了大批又红又专的社会主义积极分子，他们是开展农业增产运动，进行社会主义建设的带头人。他们敢于大胆发明创造，敢于和各种右倾保守思想进行斗争，敢于大胆的进行技术革命和革新的尝试；他们旗帜鲜明，思想活跃，冲锋陷阵，不怕失败。所有的试验田，卫星田，发明创造和思想斗争的典型范例，大部是这些人干出来的。我们要热爱和坚决支持这种先进人物和积极分子。这部分人大约占农村男女劳动力的30％左右。
    群众在大跃进中干劲冲天。各地普遍采用大兵团作战，劳武结合，劳学结合。黑夜当白天，月亮当太阳。白天红旗招展，晚上遍地明灯，日夜鏖战，真正做到了：食宿到田，办公开会到田，托儿所到田，修配农具到田，牲畜到田，百货供应到田，学习到田，文化娱乐到田。现在农村形成一个大办钢铁，大搞农业增产，大搞文化技术革命，积极支援解放台湾斗争，加速社会主义建设的群众运动的高潮到处可以听到：“深翻土地多打粮，狠狠打击美国狼”“多流钢铁水，打击美国鬼”的歌声。
    四、以水、肥、土、种、密、农具改革和田间管理七项措施为内容的农业技术革命，是农业生产建设上的一条正确路线，这条路线一为广大群众所掌握，就产生了战无不胜，攻无不克的力量。它有力地打破右倾保守思想，突破了常规，推动了农业技术改革，保证了农业大丰收。一年来，全省水利灌溉面积由原来的四千三百万亩扩大到一万一千余万亩，增加了将近两倍，等于解放前的十一倍多。不仅战胜了百日无雨的干旱，并且基本上消除了水害。过去全省每年受灾面积平均在三千万亩左右，今年在雨量大于过去的情况下，包括黄河滩地在内仅受灾二百多万亩，减少灾害90％以上。一年来共积肥九万多亿斤，按耕地面积计算，每亩平均七万斤。今年冬播小麦底肥每亩五万斤左右，施肥量比去年增加十倍以上。改良土壤和深耕有很大发展，去年小麦耕层就已经增加一倍，“卫星”田耕深一尺半以上。今年秋季作物耕层又有提高，深翻一尺以上的二千多万亩。冬播小麦八千万亩全部深翻一尺二以上，“卫星”田深翻三尺以上。各种作物全部实现良种化，全部进行密植。小麦播种量去年每亩十二、三斤，今年增加到三十斤左右，“卫星”田每亩五十斤以上。棉花、红薯由过去每亩二千株左右增加到三千株以上。水稻一般由七、八千墩增加到二万墩以上，有的达五、六万墩。在各种作物的田间管理上，做到了管理经常化，“作物不收，管理不停”。目前全省正在进行以深翻土地为中心的种麦工作，这是向地球开战，土地大翻身的一个革命运动。
    五、随着大跃进形势的发展，共产主义思想大大发扬，共产主义大协作广泛发展。这是在大跃进中出现的一种新的生产关系，也是一种共产主义萌芽，这种新的生产关系的发展，不仅对农业大丰收有着巨大的推动作用，而且对于加速社会主义建设，促进人民公社化，提高和培养广大群众的共产主义思想和道德品质，也有着十分重大的意义。到处出现“我为人人，人人为我”的新风尚，个个争上游，事事多快好省。在优先发展重工业的基础上实行工农业并举，工业与农业互相促进，全面大协作，快马加鞭，分秒必争，加速建设。去冬今春为了实现生产大跃进，全党全民，工农商学兵，拧成一股绳，打破城乡界限，地区界限，部门之间的界限，相互支援。在治水中有三百万人，在夏收夏种中有五百万人，离开家乡，自带口粮，自带工具，自带牲畜，自带种子，树苗，扛着红旗，敲锣打鼓去外地支援。这是共产主义思想的伟大表现。农村劳动力进城上山大办钢铁，支援工业；城市工人带机器，带技术下乡支援农业。亦工亦农亦兵，人人变成多面手。这种新型的城乡关系、工农关系，国家与社、个人与集体的关系，随着工农业生产的发展，正在迅速向前发展。
    河南和全国一样，正处在加速社会主义建设和为过渡到共产主义社会积极准备条件的伟大时期。河南四千八百万人民在毛泽东的旗帜下，正以不断革命的精神，以排山倒海的气概，把社会主义建设高潮一个接一个，一浪接一浪地向前推进。一年来，我们虽取得了农业生产战线上的伟大胜利，但这只是开始，更大的跃进还在1959年。我们决不能满足现状，要戒骄戒躁，总结本地经验，虚心学习外地经验，鼓足更大的干劲，团结全党全民，为巩固提高人民公社，发挥它的无比优越性，为完成和超额完成钢铁生产计划而努力；为大战山区，大干河网化，根治水旱灾害而努力；为争取明年实现小麦千斤省和全年更大丰收，从根本上解决粮食问题，大力支援国家建设而努力。目前全党和全省人民正信心百倍地为完成这一伟大而艰巨的任务而英勇奋战。
