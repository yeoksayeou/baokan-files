Large Enterprises Must Vigorously Launch Mass Movements

China's iron and steel industry takes off with two wings: one is "large (large and medium-sized enterprises), foreign (modern production methods), mass (mass line)"; the other is "small (small enterprises), indigenous (local methods), mass (mass line)"; this is the concrete manifestation of the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises and combining "indigenous" and "foreign" methods in the iron and steel industry. In the aspect of "small, indigenous, mass," the broad masses have already been mobilized. They have shattered the mystique of running the iron and steel industry, vigorously engaging in indigenous methods of iron and steel smelting, creating all sorts of miracles, and presenting a flourishing scene with satellites being launched in competition. They are full of confidence in completing this year's iron and steel production plan. However, in the aspect of "large, foreign, mass," mainly the eighteen key iron and steel enterprises nationwide, some of these enterprises have not yet fully mobilized the masses. In these enterprises, some cadres (even including a few enterprise leaders) are unwilling to mobilize the workers. There is no vigorous mass movement there, but a cold and desolate atmosphere, clinging to "rules" and "regulations." Even when the workers have already broken through production conventions and created new achievements, they are still shaking their heads and criticizing. These comrades account for a considerable proportion in large enterprises, and their influence cannot be ignored.

In his important talks with Xinhua News Agency reporters after inspecting various parts of the country and returning to Beijing, Chairman Mao pointed out: "On the iron and steel front, the broad masses have already been mobilized. However, nationwide, there are some places, some enterprises, where the work of mobilizing the masses has not been done well, mass meetings have not been held, and the tasks, reasons, and methods have not been explained clearly to the masses, nor have debates been launched among the masses. To this day, we still have some comrades who are unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in industry, and they describe engaging in mass movements on the industrial front as 'irregular,' belittling it as 'rural style' and 'guerrilla habits.' This is obviously wrong." Chairman Mao's instructions have particularly important significance for those key iron and steel enterprises that are unwilling to vigorously launch mass movements. Key iron and steel enterprises play a decisive role in completing this year's iron and steel production tasks. More than 80% of the steel and more than 40% of the iron planned for this year rely on these enterprises to complete. If the erroneous thinking existing among the leaders of some key enterprises is not refuted, the mass movement there will encounter stumbling blocks, and this year's iron and steel production will suffer losses.

The first mistake of this group of comrades is that they are superstitious about equipment, superstitious about "things," and do not value the "people" and the "theory of conditions." They say: Want to increase iron and steel production? Please bring cranes and motors! Indeed, adding new equipment is necessary and is one of the important measures to complete the iron and steel production task, which no one has denied. However, this is by no means the only condition, and the question is how to create these conditions: by relying on a few leaders to reach out to higher authorities, or by mobilizing the broad masses to create them? Is it passively waiting, or actively striving?

Our opposition to the "theory of conditions" does not mean fundamentally denying the role of conditions. On the contrary, we believe that conditions are important, but conditions must be created by people; and how to give play to the role of existing conditions depends on people's use. "Things" are static, while the power of people is infinite. The exertion of the role of "things" depends on the degree of people's understanding and mastery of "things." Only by mobilizing the broad masses of workers to create equipment conditions with one heart and one mind can equipment conditions be created faster and better. For example, after the output of a steel plant increased, several open-hearth furnaces simultaneously tapped steel, and the cranes were not enough. At this time, some people advocated reducing the charge, slowing down the tapping, or increasing the number of cranes to solve this contradiction; while the workers and the masses advocated, on the contrary, that steel should be smelted quickly and tapped quickly. If one steel furnace is faster, the use of cranes by other furnaces will be easier. At the same time, they put the molten steel ladle on the rack and pushed it, which also solved the difficulty of insufficient cranes. According to the former idea, passively waiting and not daring to break the old balance will only lead to the regression of steel production. This is the backward-looking and regressive method proposed by people who "dare not sleep for fear of wetting the bed"; while the latter idea finds positive factors, seizes them, breaks through difficulties, and creates a new balance. This is the forward-looking and progressive method proposed by people with revolutionary spirit, which is the style that Communists should have.

Is it true that miracles can only be created when the "thing" conditions are good, and that miracles cannot be created when the "thing" conditions are poor? Not necessarily. The key lies in how well the initiative of people is brought into play, and in how well people grasp the conditions of "things." How can this be seen? There is an example to prove it. The open-hearth furnace of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant is far inferior to the open-hearth furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel in terms of equipment and production conditions, but the red flag of the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces nationwide is planted in Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant, not in Anshan Iron and Steel. In September, the utilization coefficient of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant was fourteen, while the best of the steel plants in Anshan Iron and Steel was only 9.98. Another example is Benxi Iron and Steel Company. The equipment and production conditions of the first iron-smelting plant are worse than those of the second iron-smelting plant, but the red flag of blast furnaces nationwide is planted in the first plant, not in the second plant. In September, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace in the first plant was 2.077, while that of the second plant was 1.982.

The second mistake of these comrades is that they are superstitious about technical regulations, superstitious about predecessors, and superstitious about old experiences. Their thinking is firmly bound by stereotypes and routines, and they dare not and have never thought of breaking routines and creating miracles. It is said that in a steel plant, the night shift workers asked to go to work early to prepare for production, so as to strive to smelt more steel, but the person in charge of the cloakroom shook his head and said that it is a rule to go to work and get off work on time, and it cannot be changed. Those dogmatists and empiricists, like the cloakroom attendant who shook his head, regard technical indicators and operating procedures as sacred and inviolable, and cannot be changed in the slightest. Therefore, they do not enthusiastically encourage, support, and promote the new creations and inventions of the broad masses, but reject them with the reasons of "non-compliance with regulations" and "unprecedented." The workers of Blast Furnace No. 8 of Anshan Iron and Steel Company took positive measures to add more charge, which once increased the daily output of pig iron to 2,000 tons. As a result, some people came out and said: "It is a fluke to produce 2,000 tons of iron!" "That is risky operation!" and so on. When the workers of Open-hearth Furnace No. 16 and Open-hearth Furnace No. 11 of the Second Steel Plant successively created new records in rapid steelmaking, some people also said that this was just an occasional phenomenon. These comrades have a common problem, that is, they do not understand that any technical indicators, operating procedures, and advanced experiences are created by the people from production practice, and they are not absolutely immutable. Today's regulations and experiences are created after breaking yesterday's established rules, and are created after negating yesterday's conclusions; and once new regulations and new experiences are created tomorrow, they will replace today's. Production practice is eternally developing forward, and new regulations and new experiences will be continuously created. For our working class and Communists, there is no miracle that we cannot create. The kind of thinking that the things of the predecessors are unattainable and cannot be changed is "Jia Gui thinking," which is incompatible with the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act.

Because of their superstition about "things," superstition about established rules, superstition about predecessors, and superstition about old experiences, they only know how to use administrative orders to carry out work, and do not know how to use the mass line, that is, to clearly explain to the workers the production tasks of the enterprise, the great significance of completing the tasks, and what measures and methods to take to complete the tasks, and to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, offer suggestions and plans, and engage in a technical revolution. Facts have proved that the unprecedented great leap forward situation that has emerged on the national iron and steel front since August this year is actually the victory of vigorously launching the mass movement under the leadership of the Party. Wherever the masses are mobilized, the production will definitely be new and the difficulties will be swept away. Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant created the highest record of open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient in the country, Dalian Steel Plant created the highest record of electric furnace utilization coefficient in the country, Benxi Iron and Steel Company First Ironmaking Plant created the highest record of blast furnace utilization coefficient in the country, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Refractory Materials Workshop created the highest record of refractory material firing time in the country, and the national steel high-yield record on September 29... all of them are victories achieved by fully mobilizing the masses under the leadership of the Party.

To let go of mobilizing the masses and thoroughly take the mass line is the leading method and working method that we must follow in all our work; if there is only the enthusiasm of a few leaders in doing any work, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses is not mobilized, the result can only be the empty busy of a few people. Now there are only seventy days left until the end of the year. The task facing the eighteen key enterprises is still very arduous. The most fundamental guarantee for completing and overfulfilling this arduous task is to immediately launch a mass movement under the unified leadership of the Party.

For key enterprises, vigorously launching mass movements, first of all, requires a movement of ideological emancipation among cadres and technicians, to eliminate their superstition about "things," technical regulations, and predecessors, and to liberate them from the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism. At the same time, it is necessary to thoroughly take the mass line, hand over the production tasks to hundreds of thousands of iron and steel workers, and mobilize them more deeply, more thoroughly, and more extensively to complete this year's plan, pool their wisdom and efforts, and engage in a technical revolution; so that every factory, furnace, and team has its own plan and its own leap forward goals. It is also necessary to conscientiously promote the experience of two participations (cadres participating in labor and workers participating in management), one change (reforming rules and regulations), and three combinations (under the leadership of the Party, administrative personnel, technical personnel, and the masses of workers closely combining) in key enterprises. We believe that the potential of hundreds of thousands of iron and steel workers in the eighteen key iron and steel enterprises is endless, and they will surely be able to unite and create great miracles under the leadership of the Party; this year's iron and steel production tasks will definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

### 大企业必须大搞群众运动

    大企业必须大搞群众运动
    我国钢铁工业展翅高飞，有两个翅膀：一个是“大（大型、中型企业）、洋（现代化生产方法）、群（群众路线）”；一个是“小（小型企业）、土（土办法）、群（群众路线）”；这也就是大、中、小型企业同时并举、“土”
  “洋”结合的方针在钢铁工业上的具体体现。在“小、土、群”方面，广大群众已经发动起来了。他们打破了办钢铁工业的神秘观点，大搞土法炼铁、炼钢，已经创造出种种奇迹，出现了卫星竞发、百花齐放的局面。他们对完成今年的钢铁生产计划信心百倍。但是，在“大、洋、群”方面，主要是全国十八个重点钢铁企业，其中有好些企业还没有把群众充分发动起来，这些企业中还有一部分干部（甚至包括少数企业领导干部在内）不愿去发动职工群众，那里没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，而是冷冷清清的局面，抱住“规章”“制度”不放。甚至当工人群众已经冲破了生产常规创造出新的成就的时候，他们还在那里摇头议论，指点挑剔。这些同志在大型企业里占相当一部分人，他们的影响不可忽视。
    毛主席在巡视大江南北回京后，对新华社记者发表的重要谈话中指出：“在钢铁战线上，广大群众已经发动起来了。但是就全国来说，有一些地方，有一些企业，对于发动群众的工作还没有做好，没有开群众大会，没有将任务、理由和方法，向群众讲得清清楚楚，并在群众中展开辩论。到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是‘不正规’，贬之为‘农村作风’、‘游击习气’。这显然是不对的。”毛主席的指示，对于那些不愿意大搞群众运动的重点钢铁企业来说，有着特别重要的意义。重点钢铁企业，对于完成今年钢铁生产任务，起着决定性的作用。今年计划产量中，80％以上的钢和40％以上的铁，依靠这些企业完成。如果不驳倒存在于某些重点企业领导人员中的错误思想，那里的群众运动就会遇到绊脚石，今年的钢铁生产就要受到损失。
    这一部分同志的第一个错误是迷信设备，迷信“物”，而不重视“人”的“唯条件论”。他们说：要增产钢铁么？请拿吊车、马达来！诚然，增添新设备是需要的，是完成钢铁生产任务的重要措施之一，这是谁也没有否认过的。但是，这绝不是唯一的条件，而且问题还在于怎样去创造这些条件：是靠少数领导人向上级伸手呢，还是发动广大群众去创造？是消极等待呢，还是积极地争取？
    我们反对“唯条件论”，并不意味着根本否定条件的作用。恰恰相反，我们认为，条件是重要的，但条件要依靠人去创造；而如何发挥已有的条件的作用，又依靠人去运用。“物”是静止的东西，而人的力量才是无穷的。“物”的作用的发挥，取决于人对“物”的认识程度和掌握程度。只有发动广大职工群众同心协力地创造设备条件，设备条件才能更快更好地创造出来。例如，有一个炼钢厂产量提高后，几座平炉同时出钢，吊车不够用了。这时有人主张少装料、慢出钢，或是增加吊车，来解决这个矛盾；而职工群众和这相反，他们主张快炼钢快出钢，一个炼钢炉快了，别的炉子使用吊车就松和了，他们同时把钢水包放在架子上，推着走，也解决了吊车不够的困难。按照前一种主张，消极等待，不敢打破旧的平衡，结果只有使钢产量退步走，这是“怕尿床就不敢睡觉”的人提出来的、向后看的、促退的办法；而后一种主张，寻找积极的因素，抓住它，冲破困难，创造新的平衡，这是具有革命气概的人提出来的、向前看的、促进的办法，是共产党人应有的风格。
    是不是“物”的条件好才能创造奇迹，“物”的条件差就不能呢？未必。决定的关键在于人的能动性发挥的程度如何，在于人对“物”的条件掌握的程度如何。何以见得？有例为证。上海钢铁公司三厂的平炉，论设备、论生产条件，比鞍钢的平炉差远矣，但是全国平炉利用系数的红旗插在上钢三厂，而不在鞍钢。9月份，上钢三厂的利用系数是十四，而鞍钢各炼钢厂，最好的只有九点九八。再如本溪钢铁公司，第一炼铁厂的设备和生产条件都比第二炼铁厂差，但是全国高炉的红旗插在一厂而不在二厂。9月份一厂的高炉利用系数为二点零七七，二厂是一点九八二。
    这些同志的第二个错误是迷信技术规程，迷信前人，迷信老经验。他们的思想被陈套、常规拴得死死的，不敢也不曾想去打破常规、创造奇迹。据说有一个炼钢厂，夜班工人要求提前上班，作生产准备工作，好争取多炼些钢，但是看管更衣室的人摇摇头说，按时上下班是制度，改动不得。那些教条主义者和经验主义者，就像这位摇头的更衣室看管人一样，把技术指标、操作规程，当作神圣不可侵犯的东西，丝毫变动不得。因此，他们对于广大群众新的创造发明，不是去热情地加以鼓励、支持和推广，而是以“不合规程”、“从古未有”为理由顶回去。鞍钢八号高炉的职工采取多上料的积极措施，曾使生铁日产量提高到二千吨，于是，有人出来说话了：“出二千吨铁是侥幸！”“那是冒险作业！”等等。第二炼钢厂的十六号平炉、十一号平炉的工人们，接连创造出快速炼钢的新纪录时，也有人说这不过是偶然的现象。这些同志有个通病，就是他们不懂得，任何技术指标、操作规程、先进经验，都是人民群众从生产实践中创造出来的，它们并不是绝对不可变更的。今天的规程、经验，是打破了昨天的成规后创造出来的，是否定了昨天的结论之后创造出来的；而一旦明天创造了新的规程、经验，又会把今天的取而代之。生产实践是永恒地向前发展着的，新的规程、新的经验也就会不断地创造出来。对于我们工人阶级和共产党人来说，没有什么奇迹是我们创造不出来的。那种认为前人的东西高不可攀、改动不得的思想，就是“贾桂思想”，这是和敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格不相容的。
    由于迷信“物”，迷信成规，迷信前人，迷信老经验，他们只会用行政命令的办法去进行工作，不会用群众路线的办法，即把企业的生产任务、完成任务的重大意义以及采取什么措施和方法去完成任务等等，向职工群众清清楚楚地交底，发动群众大鸣大放，献策献计，大闹技术革命。事实证明，今年8月以来，全国钢铁战线上出现的空前未有的大跃进局面，其实就是在党的领导下大搞群众运动的胜利。哪里只要发动了群众，哪里生产上就一定能气象一新，困难为之一扫。上钢三厂创造全国平炉利用系数最高纪录，大连钢厂创造全国电炉利用系数最高纪录，本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂创造全国高炉利用系数最高纪录，重庆钢铁公司耐火材料车间创造全国耐火材料烧成时间的最高纪录，9月29日全国钢铁高产纪录……，无一不是在党的领导下充分发动群众所取得的胜利。
    放手发动群众，彻底走群众路线，这是我们从事一切工作所必须遵循的领导方法和工作方法；做任何一件工作，假如只有少数领导人的积极性，而没有发动广大群众的积极性，结果只能是少数人的空忙。现在离年底只剩下七十天了。摆在十八个重点企业面前的任务还是很繁重的。完成和超额完成这个繁重的任务，最根本的保证就是要在党的统一领导下，立即大搞群众运动。
    对于重点企业来说，大搞群众运动，首先要在干部和技术人员中来一个思想解放运动，破除他们对“物”，对技术成规，对前人的迷信，使他们从教条主义和经验主义的束缚中解放出来。与此同时，必须彻底地走群众路线，把生产任务交给数十万钢铁工人，更深、更透、更广泛地发动他们为完成今年的计划，群策群力，大闹技术革命；使每一个工厂、炉子、班组都有自己的计划，都有自己的跃进目标。还要在重点企业里认真推行两参（干部参加劳动，工人参加管理）、一改（改革规章制度）、三结合（在党的领导下，行政人员、技术人员和工人群众密切结合）的经验。我们相信，十八个重点钢铁企业数十万钢铁工人的潜力是无穷无尽的，他们一定能在党的领导下，团结一致，创造出伟大的奇迹；今年的钢铁生产任务一定能够完成和超额完成。
