Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Matsumoto and Hirano Condemn US War Provocations Against China
Opposing American aggression is the common struggle task of the Chinese and Japanese people.
Asia is for Asians. American troops must withdraw quickly.
Xinhua News Agency, October 6th - Matsumoto Jiichiro, head of the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation visiting China, and Hirano Yoshitaro, the deputy head, met with Xinhua News Agency reporters today to discuss the situation in the Taiwan Strait region and related issues.

Matsumoto Jiichiro first pointed out that Taiwan is Chinese territory, which no one can deny, and more and more Americans have this idea. He added that if the United States did not interfere, the Taiwan issue would be easy to resolve.

Matsumoto said that some time ago, the United States suffered a defeat in the Middle East, and now it has turned its attention to the Far East. He said that today's China is no longer the chaotic China of the past. 600 million people are united and making great leaps forward, and the claim that they harbor the intention of "invading Asia" is ridiculous. He expressed his belief that the ambitions of the United States are bound to fail.

Hirano Yoshitaro emphasized in his speech that the "ceasefire" issue raised by the United States does not exist. In fact, the United States is carrying out aggression. As long as the United States stops its aggression and the US Seventh Fleet withdraws from the Taiwan Strait region, the problem will be solved. He went on to say that the issues of Taiwan, Kinmen, and Matsu are China's internal affairs, and China can exercise its sovereignty. It is completely unreasonable for the United States to submit this issue to the United Nations. He also said that the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is exactly the same in nature as the "Security Treaty" signed between the United States and Japan, and both are aimed at antagonizing China. He pointed out that these two treaties, signed during the Korean War, are invalid and should be abolished.

Matsumoto Jiichiro and Hirano Yoshitaro both criticized the United States for using Japanese bases to carry out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region and condemned the Kishida Nobusuke government for following the United States and antagonizing China. Matsumoto pointed out that the United States has military bases in Japan, and the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is also a major threat to Japan. Hirano listed facts to expose the United States' use of military bases in Japan to create tension in the Taiwan Strait region, and he said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the facts revealed in the Soviet government's memorandum, but this cannot be denied. They also revealed that the Kishida Nobusuke government shielded the Liao Wenyi group, creating the impression that some people were demanding "independence" for Taiwan. They pointed out that Taiwan is actually under US military rule, and the true purpose of the United States is to directly occupy Taiwan.

They said that more and more Japanese people are realizing that the Kishida Nobusuke government's policy of antagonizing China is only harmful and not beneficial to them. They also talked about the rising struggle of the Japanese people against US military bases. In October, the Japanese people will hold a series of national conferences to discuss issues such as the prohibition of nuclear weapons, the situation in the Taiwan Strait region, and the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations. The Japanese people will also hold large demonstrations for this purpose. They said that the purpose of these actions is to stop the United States from using military bases in Japan to create tension in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region. They also mentioned that the demand for the recovery of Okinawa is also growing in Japan.

They said that the common struggle goal of the Asian people is to make the US military withdraw from Taiwan, Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and South Vietnam. Matsumoto said that Asia should become Asia's Asia. He said that, in the final analysis, this is a matter of unity among peace-loving people. As long as all Asian people unite and become strong, European and American aggressor countries will not be able to enter Asia.

Matsumoto and Hirano are both members of the World Peace Council. They talked about the significance of the World Peace Council's recent appeal calling for the withdrawal of US troops from the Taiwan Strait region.

Matsumoto Jiichiro, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said that the work of the Japan-China Friendship Association is to unite the people of Japan and China, so that Asia can truly become Asia's Asia and eliminate all colonies and concessions from Asia. He said that this work is closely related to world peace.

    反对美国侵略是中日人民共同斗争任务
    松本和平野斥美国对我国的战争挑衅
    亚洲是亚洲人的亚洲  美国军队必须快撤走
    新华社6日讯　日中友好协会访华代表团团长松本治一郎和副团长平野义太郎今天接见了新华社记者，就台湾海峡地区局势和有关问题发表了谈话。
    松本治一郎首先指出，台湾是中国的领土，这是任何人都不能否认的，具有这种想法的美国人也愈来愈多。他又说，如果美国不插手进来，台湾问题是容易解决的。
    松本说，前些时候，美国在中东遭到失败，现在他又把矛头转到远东。他说，今天的中国已经不是过去的混乱的中国，六亿人民团结一致，正在大跃进，说他们抱有“侵略亚洲”的意图的说法是可笑的。他表示相信，美国的野心一定要失败。
    平野义太郎在谈话中着重说，美国提出的“停火”问题并不存在，实际上是美国在进行侵略，只要美国停止侵略，只要美国第七舰队撤出台湾海峡地区，问题就解决了。他接着说，台湾、金门和马祖的问题是中国的内政问题，中国可以行使主权，美国要把这个问题提交到联合国去，是完全没有道理的。他又说，美国和蒋介石签订的“共同防御条约”同美国和日本签订的“安全条约”的性质完全一样，其目的都是敌视中国。他指出，这两个在朝鲜战争期间签订的条约是无效的，都应当废除。
    松本治一郎和平野义太郎都抨击美国利用日本基地在台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅，并且谴责岸信介政府追随美国、敌视中国的态度。松本指出，美国在日本有军事基地，台湾海峡局势紧张对日本也是一个很大的威胁。平野列举事实揭露美国利用在日本的军事基地在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，他说，日本外务省否认苏联政府备忘录所揭露的事实，这是否认不了的。他们还揭露，岸信介政府包庇廖文毅集团，制造有人要求台湾“独立”的印象。他们指出，实际上台湾处于美国的军事统治之下，美国的真正目的是要直接占领台湾。
    他们说，愈来愈多的日本人民认识到岸信介政府敌视中国的政策，对他们只有害处，没有好处。他们还谈到了日益高涨的日本人民反对美军基地的斗争。10月间，日本人民将举行一系列的国民大会，讨论禁止核武器、台湾海峡地区局势、恢复日中邦交等问题。日本人民还将为此举行大示威。他们说，这些行动的目的在于制止美国利用在日本的军事基地在台湾和在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势。他们还谈到，要求收复冲绳的呼声在日本也愈来愈高。
    他们说，使美军撤出台湾、日本、冲绳、南朝鲜和南越等地，是亚洲人民的共同斗争目标。松本说，要使亚洲成为亚洲人的亚洲。他说，归根到底，这是爱好和平的人民团结一致的问题，只要全亚洲人民团结起来，强大起来，欧美侵略国家就进不了亚洲。
    松本和平野都是世界和平理事会理事，他们谈到了世界和平理事会最近发表的要求美军撤出台湾海峡地区的呼吁书的意义。
    日中友好协会会长松本治一郎说，日中友协的工作就是把日中两国人民团结起来，使亚洲真正变成亚洲人的亚洲，从亚洲消除一切殖民地和租借地。他说，这个工作与世界和平是密切关联的。
