Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 26th: Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 10 Blast Furnace, the largest in China, is nearing completion. It has only taken four months from breaking ground to near completion, far exceeding the fastest construction speed of large blast furnaces in the world. The builders are currently rushing to install the final batch of metal structures and mechanical equipment in the last few days so that the blast furnace can produce molten iron as soon as possible.

The effective volume of No. 10 Blast Furnace is more than one-half larger than the largest blast furnace currently at Anshan Iron and Steel, and more than 120 cubic meters larger than Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace. After this blast furnace is put into production, the molten iron produced in one day can be smelted into steel to manufacture more than 1,000 heavy-duty trucks, or lay more than 100 kilometers of railway. It will basically solve the current tight situation of insufficient molten iron in Anshan Iron and Steel, and provide a reliable guarantee for fully exploiting the potential of open-hearth furnaces and overfulfilling this year's leap forward plan for steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 26th: The two large open-hearth furnaces that Anshan Iron and Steel started building in June of this year have entered the completion stage and will soon be completed and produce steel one after the other.

The original design of these two open-hearth furnaces was the same as the largest open-hearth furnaces currently in the world, with a charging capacity of 500 tons. However, during the construction process, the design and construction departments absorbed the new technology of three-tap steelmaking from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and modified the original design without changing the structure of the plant, increasing the charging capacity of each furnace to 660 tons, making them the largest open-hearth furnaces in the world, while the construction speed was more than doubled compared to the original plan.

    我国最大的高炉和平炉
    据新华社鞍山26日电　在鞍山建设的我国最大的高炉——鞍钢十号高炉，即将竣工。这座高炉从挖第一铲土到现在，只有四个多月，远远超过了世界大型高炉的最快建设速度。建设者们在最近几天中，正在突击安装最后一批金属结构和机械设备，使高炉尽早流出铁水。
    十号高炉的有效容积比目前鞍钢最大的高炉大二分之一以上，比武钢一号高炉还大一百二十多立方公尺。这座高炉投入生产后，一天生产的铁水炼成钢，能够制造一千多辆载重汽车，或是铺设一百多公里铁路。它将基本解决目前鞍钢铁水不足的紧张状况，为充分发挥平炉潜力、超额完成今年钢的跃进计划提供了可靠的保证。
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢今年6月间动工兴建的两座大平炉，已经跨进竣工阶段，即将相继建成出钢。
    这两座平炉原设计同目前国际上拥有的最大平炉一样，装入量都为五百吨。但是在施工过程中，设计和施工部门吸收了太原钢铁厂三槽出钢的新技术，在厂房结构不变的情况下，修改了原设计，把每座炉的装入量扩大为六百六十吨，成为目前世界上最大的平炉，而施工速度反比原计划加快了一倍多。
