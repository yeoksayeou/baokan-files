　　Cannot be Exempted

　　The mass line and mass movements are the "golden keys" to victory. Countless historical examples and countless leaps forward have proven this truth.

　　However, some comrades are still unwilling to launch mass movements in the industrial field. They emphasize the particularity of industrial production (such as tight production schedules, complex technologies, etc.), advocate the "regularization" of industrial production, and fear that mobilizing the masses will disrupt production.

　　The news published in this newspaper today about Liaoning's mass conservation of electricity and the establishment of power stations is a powerful rebuttal to this view. Setting up power plants has always been the business of power plant workers. Now, many factories, mines, schools, communes, and organizations and troops in other industries in Liaoning are also setting up their own power stations. These "laymen" quickly mastered the complex technology of power generation and the production of power generation equipment, and did not cause any trouble. On the contrary, it is precisely because of mass movements that it is possible to solve the contradiction of insufficient power in the great leap forward in production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

　　Mass movements should be carried out in all work, and industrial production is no exception.

### 不能例外

    不能例外
    走群众路线，开展群众运动，是通向胜利的“金钥匙”。说不完的历史事例，数不清的跃进奇迹，都证明了这一真理。
    可是，有一部分同志至今还不愿意在工业方面大搞群众运动。他们强调工业生产的特殊性（什么生产紧张、技术复杂，等等），主张工业生产要“正规化”，生怕群众发动起来，会把生产搞乱了。
    今天本报发表的辽宁全民节约用电、兴办电站的消息，对这种观点是一个有力的驳斥。办电从来是电站职工的事。现在辽宁许多其他行业的工厂、矿山、学校、公社以及机关、部队也自己办起电站来了。这些“外行”很快掌握了复杂的发电以及生产发电设备的技术，并没有闹出什么乱子。相反的，正因为搞了群众运动，才有利于又多又快又好又省地解决生产大跃进中电力不足的矛盾。
    什么工作都要搞群众运动，工业生产并不例外。
