A Banner for Indigenous Copper Smelting
By Our Correspondent Chen Zheng

The sixteen indigenous furnaces of the local state-owned Mouding Copper Mine in Yunnan Province, which have already been put into production, have all smelted copper. By August, they had smelted more than ten tons of blister copper, becoming a banner for indigenous copper smelting.

The Mouding Copper Mine was officially established in mid-February of this year. According to geological exploration data, the prospective reserves of copper in the mining area are about 500,000 tons, of which sulfide ore accounts for more than 80%, with a grade of only about 1%. The production conditions were also extremely poor. The entire mining area had neither modern equipment nor engineers or experts.

Of the initial sixty-eight employees who went up the mountain to smelt copper, only the factory director knew some mining knowledge. The rest were demobilized soldiers who had never seen an indigenous copper smelting furnace. They had to go around asking for advice and found Wu Jiakuan, a 76-year-old indigenous expert who had smelted copper locally. Without a single technician, they relied on this old man to build the first furnace using local refractory stone and refractory sand, and smelted 53 kilograms of copper in 21 hours. With Wu Jiakuan's help, more than 40 of the 68 employees quickly learned the technology of building indigenous furnaces and indigenous operation. They later became the furnace chiefs of the sixteen indigenous furnaces.

The first indigenous furnace was built using the ancient local structure and methods, so it required "pouring the furnace to extract copper." That is, each time copper was smelted, the slag and ore had to be taken out while still hot at high temperatures, and then the furnace was cooled with water to freeze the copper inside the furnace, and finally the furnace was broken to take out the copper. In this way, it took three or four days to repair the furnace each time copper was produced, which seriously affected production. Operating at high temperatures was also bad for the workers' health. In order to improve the structure and operation method of the furnace, the mine leadership sent people to other mining areas to study and visit, and invited experienced masters from other mining areas to guide the work in the mining area. Based on foreign experience, they successively built eight types of indigenous furnaces, such as "Dongchuan type," "Jiangsu type," and "Sichuan type," for comparative research. As a result, a "Leap Forward Furnace" that absorbed the advantages of various furnaces was built in the cadres' experimental field. This furnace has the advantages of stable furnace temperature and normal production. At the same time, the problem of continuous copper tapping was solved by adopting the method of retaining the copper tapping port.

The quality of the ore and the amount of material added directly affect the output and quality of copper. Since 80% of the ore in the Mouding mining area is sulfide ore with a high content of silicon dioxide that is difficult to smelt, adding too much results in very poor quality copper or even no copper at all. In order to master the smelting method of sulfide ore, the workers used two methods for testing: smelting a mixture of sulfide ore and oxide ore and smelting sulfide ore separately. When testing mixed smelting, according to the characteristics of sulfide ore, such as high hardness and high silicon dioxide content, five measures were taken, including using smaller ore pieces than oxide ore when charging, processing oxide ore first, and adding sulfide ore to the furnace charge after the furnace condition is normal and the furnace temperature rises, which solved the problem of difficult-to-melt silicon dioxide. Oxide ore was smelted separately in twelve tests. Practice has proved that smelting sulfide ore directly in the furnace does not produce copper. It must be roasted first to reduce the silicon dioxide content. The Mouding mining area also adopted the method of obtaining materials locally and using simple equipment to solve the roasting equipment. At the same time, the roasting method was explored in the experiment. In August, the mining area had already smelted more than 30 kilograms of blister copper separately using roasted sulfide ore.

At the beginning of smelting, influenced by the old view that "the more coke used, the higher the furnace temperature; the higher the furnace temperature, the more normal the furnace," the coke ratio was as high as 170%, and generally around 100%. Excessive coke usage instead produced five major harms. In addition to wasting coke and increasing production costs, excessive coke often caused insufficient wind pressure, enhanced the reducibility of the ore, and the smelted product was mostly copper-iron alloy. Excessive coke usage also easily caused the high-temperature zone to move upward, lowering the temperature of the original high-temperature zone, causing poor digestion in the furnace, and easily blocking the furnace. The mine's Party general branch promptly put forward the call to "use the least amount of coke to consume the most ore." Now, the general coke ratio has been reduced to 17% to 23%, and the Leap Forward Furnace has even created a record of 14.3%. The copper smelted in this way is of higher quality.

To make the indigenous furnace produce copper normally, it also needs relatively ideal blowing equipment. Most of the blowing equipment here is hand-pulled bellows, and each furnace requires ten to twelve people to take turns pulling the bellows in two shifts. Due to the unevenness of physical strength, manual pulling of the bellows often produces defects such as air stoppages, which affects the normal production of the furnace. The Party general branch led the workers to carry out a technical innovation campaign based on the existing equipment. The workers in the carpentry team worked hard for two days and nights and successfully trial-produced a hydraulic blower. Using a hydraulic blower can reduce one-third of the labor force, and at the same time can avoid many of the shortcomings of manual bellows pulling. The speed of this blower can reach 1,500 to 2,000 revolutions per minute; the cost of a hydraulic blower is only more than 90 yuan. Later, the workers also created semi-mechanized blowers in the form of horse-drawn, foot-pedaled, and hand-cranked, using them to replace people pulling the bellows. In the technical innovation campaign, the workers also greatly saved labor by using large blasting for mining and vehicle-based transportation.

    土法炼铜的一面旗帜
    本报记者　陈铮
    云南省地方国营牟定铜矿已经投入生产的十六座土炉子全部炼出了铜，到8月间就炼出粗铜十多吨，成为土法炼铜的一面旗帜。
    牟定铜矿是今年2月中旬正式建立的。根据地质勘探资料，矿区铜的远景储量约五十万吨，其中硫化矿占80％强，品位只有1％左右。生产条件也是一穷二白，整个矿区既无现代化设备，也没有工程师、专家。
    最初上山炼铜的六十八个职工中，除了厂长懂得些矿业知识外，其余都是复员军人，他们从未见过炼铜的土炉子。他们只好四出访贤问能，找到了个曾经在当地炼过铜的七十六岁的土专家吴家宽。在没有一个技术人员的情况下，就靠这位老人利用当地的耐火石、耐火泥沙砌起了第一座炉子，并在二十一小时内炼出了五十三公斤铜。在吴家宽的帮助下，六十八个职工中很快就有四十多个人学会了砌土炉和土法操作的技术。他们后来成了十六座土炉的炉长。
    第一座土炉是沿用当地古老的结构形式和方法修筑的，因此需要“泼炉出铜”。即每炼一次铜，必须在高温下趁热将?和矿石掏出来，再用水将炉泼冷，使铜冻结在炉内，最后破炉将铜取出。这样，每出一次铜需花三、四天的时间修炉子，严重影响产量。工人在高温下操作，对身体健康也不利。为了改进炉子的构造和操作方法，矿区领导一方面派人到别的矿区去学习、参观，一方面邀请其它矿区的老师傅来矿区指导。他们根据外地的经验，先后建起了“东川式”、“江苏式”、“四川式”等八种形式的土炉子，进行比较研究。结果，在干部试验田里试建了一座吸取了各种炉子优点的“跃进炉”。这种炉子具有炉温稳定、生产正常等优点，同时由于采取了留淌铜水口的办法，解决了连续出铜的问题。
    矿石的好坏和加料的数量都会直接影响铜的产量和质量。牟定矿区由于80％的矿石是含二氧化矽较高的、不易熔炼的硫化矿，放多了炼出的铜质量很坏，甚至炼不出铜来。职工们为了掌握硫化矿的冶炼方法，曾采用硫化矿和氧化矿混合炼及硫化矿单独冶炼的两种方法进行试验。试验混合冶炼时，按照硫化矿硬度较大、含二氧化矽高等特点，采取入炉块度比氧化矿小一点和先处理氧化矿，待炉况正常、炉温提高后，在炉料中再配入硫化矿等五种措施，解决了二氧化矽难熔的问题。氧化矿单独冶炼，先后试验了十二次。实践证明，将硫化矿直接放入炉中冶炼，炼不出铜来，一定要先经过焙烧，降低二氧化矽的含量。牟定矿区还采取就地取材、因陋就简的办法，解决了焙烧的设备，同时在试验中摸索到了焙烧的方法。8月间，矿区就已经用焙烧过的硫化矿单独炼出了三十多公斤粗铜。
    在刚开始冶炼时，受“用焦炭愈多，炉温愈高；炉温愈高，炉子愈正常”这一老看法的影响，焦比曾高达170％，一般也在100％左右。用焦炭过多反而产生了五大害处。除浪费焦炭，增加生产成本外，还往往因焦炭过多使风压不足，增强矿石的还原性，冶炼出来的大多是铜铁合金。用焦炭过多，还容易使高温区上移，使原来的高温区降低温度，造成炉内消化不良，容易堵死炉子。矿区党总支及时提出了“用最少的焦炭吃最多的矿石”的号召，现在一般焦比都已经降低到17％到23％，跃进炉还曾创造过14.3％的纪录。这样炼出来的铜，质量反而更高。
    要使土炉子正常出铜，还需要有比较理想的鼓风设备。这里的绝大部分鼓风设备是手拉风箱，每个炉子需要十到十二个人分两班轮换拉风箱。由于体力强弱不均，人工拉风箱常产生停风等缺点，影响炉子的正常生产。党总支领导职工们在现有设备的基础上开展了技术革新运动。木工组的工人们苦战两昼夜，试制成功了水力鼓风机。使用水力鼓风机，可以减少三分之一的劳动力，同时可以避免人工拉风箱的许多缺陷。这种鼓风机每分钟转速可以达到一千五百到二千转；一台水力鼓风机的成本只要九十多元。后来，工人们又创造出马拉、脚踏、手摇等形式的半机械化鼓风机，用它们代替人拉风箱。在技术革新运动中，职工们还用大爆破采矿和运输车子化的办法，大大节省了劳动力。
