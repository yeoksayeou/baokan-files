    Sending Grain, Transporting Grass, Increasing Troops and Adding Generals for the Steel Commander
    National Commercial Workers Strive to Support Steel Production in Every Possible Way

    (Our report) The broad masses of commercial workers across the country are doing everything possible to "send grain, transport grass," "increase troops and add generals" for the steel marshal, supporting steel production in every possible way.

    Commercial departments in various regions, under the unified leadership of the Party committees, have mobilized the masses and launched a massive campaign to collect scrap steel and scrap metal. According to incomplete statistics, from January to August, more than 1.1 million tons of scrap steel have been purchased nationwide, exceeding the original annual plan by more than 25%; more than 86,000 tons of scrap copper have been purchased, exceeding the original annual plan by more than double.

    In order to ensure that workers eat well and live well, commercial departments in various regions are making every effort to strengthen the supply of daily necessities to the steel front lines. They have basically ensured that wherever there is a construction site, there are vegetables to eat; pork and other non-staple foods are also given priority supply to steel bases and industrial and mining areas. When the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex was at its most intense, many stores in Wuhan operated around the clock, allowing workers on day and night shifts to eat at any time. Employees of retail stores in the suburbs of Hangzhou moved their bedding to the construction sites of small blast furnaces, lived and ate with the workers, and sold goods around the clock. Commercial departments in various regions have also added supply points in the vast rural areas and mountainous mining bases and small blast furnace construction sites.

    Commercial departments in various regions have also adopted measures such as streamlining institutions, reducing staff, recruiting housewives, using women instead of men, using the elderly instead of the strong, and establishing resident consignment stores, in order to extract young and middle-aged labor from commercial departments and transfer them to the steel and industrial fronts. Commercial departments in many regions have overcome all difficulties, promoted the spirit of communist cooperation, "stopped cars to give way," and supported the urgent needs of steel construction sites with various raw materials and equipment. For example, when the Shanghai Second Steel Store heard the call from the Municipal Metallurgical Office that they were "waiting for rice to cook," it immediately took the initiative to support the steel industry with the 17 tons of thick steel plates that the Jiangnan Shipyard had provided to the store; when the store heard that the Shanghai Third Steel Plant was temporarily unable to supply raw pig iron, it immediately supplied all the more than 100 tons of pig iron in stock, and directly transported the 200 tons of pig iron shipped from Suzhou to the store to the steel plant, solving the urgent needs of the steel plant.

### 为钢帅送粮运草增兵添将  全国商业职工千方百计支援钢铁生产

    为钢帅送粮运草增兵添将
    全国商业职工千方百计支援钢铁生产
    本报讯　全国商业部门广大职工，正在千方百计地为钢铁元帅“送粮运草”“增兵添将”，从各个方面支持钢铁生产。
    各地商业部门，都在党委的统一领导下，发动群众，掀起了声势浩大的大收废钢铁、废金属的运动。据不完全统计，全国1—8月份，已收购废钢铁一百一十多万吨，超过原定全年计划的25％；收购杂铜八万六千多吨，超过原定全年计划一倍以上。
    为了让工人吃好、生活好，各地商业部门全力以赴地加强了对钢铁前线的生活资料供应工作。基本上做到哪里有工地，哪里有菜吃；猪肉和其他副食品，也是优先供应钢铁基地和工矿区。武汉商业部门在武钢施工最紧张的时候，许多商店昼夜不停，通宵营业，使日班和夜班的工人都能随时吃到东西。杭州市郊区各零售商店的职工，把铺盖搬到小高炉工地上，和工人同吃同住，昼夜不停地跟班售货。在广大农村、山区的矿山基地和小高炉群工地，各地商业部门也都增设了供应点。
    各地商业部门，还采取了紧缩机构，精简人员，吸收家庭妇女，以女代男，以老代壮，大办居民代销店等办法，把商业部门中的青壮年劳动力抽出来，输送到钢铁和工业战线上去。许多地区的商业部门，排除万难，发扬共产主义协作精神，“停车让路”，以各种原材料、器材支援钢铁工地的急需。如上海第二钢铁商店，听到市冶金办公室的“等米下锅”的呼声后，立即主动地将江南造船厂支援该店的十七吨厚钢板支援了钢铁工业；当该店听到上海第三钢铁厂生铁原料一时供应不上的消息时，一面将库存仅有的一百多吨生铁扫数供应，一面将苏州发运该店的二百吨生铁，直运钢厂，解决了钢厂的急需。
