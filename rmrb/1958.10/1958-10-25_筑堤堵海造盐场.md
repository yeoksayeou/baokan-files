Building Dykes to Enclose the Sea for Salt Fields

The Zhanjiang and Leidong sea enclosure projects, which mark Zhanjiang City's leap towards becoming a chemical industry base, have recently commenced in the Puzixu and Donghai Island areas of Zhanjiang City and Leidong County, respectively. Two giant seawalls will be constructed, extending from Zhanjiang City towards Donghai Island in Leidong County, a distance of six to seven kilometers. These two dykes will later be widened and railway tracks laid upon them, extending the Li-Zhan Railway to Donghai Island.

Zhanjiang City plans to build itself into a chemical industry base within three years. The main raw material for the chemical industry is salt. The Zhanjiang Soda Ash Plant, which is currently under construction, alone requires hundreds of thousands of tons of raw salt annually. Electrolysis plants, nylon plants, calcium cyanamide fertilizer plants, and other planned facilities also require large quantities of salt as raw material. Upon completion of the sea enclosure project, a large salt field, rare in the world, with an annual output of five million tons of salt will be gradually built on 210,000 mu of beaches inside and outside the northeast and southwest seawalls.

    筑堤堵海造盐场
    标志着湛江市向化学工业基地跃进的湛江、雷东堵海工程，已于最近在湛江市铺仔墟和雷东县东海岛两个工区先后动工。这里将修建两条巨大的海堤从湛江市伸向六、七公里以外的雷东县东海岛。这两条大堤将来还要加宽堤面，铺设铁轨，把黎湛铁路伸延到东海岛去。
    湛江市规划在三年内建成为化学工业基地。化学工业的主要原料是盐，单是正在兴建中的湛江制碱厂，每年就需要原料盐数十万吨。计划兴建的电解厂、尼龙厂、石灰氮肥厂等也需要大量的盐作原料。堵海工程完成以后，在东北和西南两大海堤内外二十一万亩海滩上，将逐步建成一个年产盐五百万吨的世界上少有的大盐场。（附图片）
