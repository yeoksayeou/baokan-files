Open Hearth Workers, Catch Up Quickly!
    The No. 1 Open Hearth Workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant has raised a red banner for open hearth furnaces. We are extremely delighted to see a high-yield red banner appearing on open hearth furnaces.

    This year, the vast majority of the newly built modern steelmaking furnaces across the country are open hearth furnaces, but the utilization coefficient is generally not high. Some produce less than 40-50 tons of steel per nominal ton per day and night, while the open hearth furnaces of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant have increased to over 90 tons. This cannot but be a major event in open hearth production.

    How should we view this major event? Can we catch up quickly and seize such high-yield records? Some say no, because this workshop uses acid open hearth furnaces and special high-quality materials for steelmaking, while the alkaline open hearth furnaces currently being built on a large scale in our country use poor-quality materials. Granted, the good quality of the pig iron raw materials used by the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant is a favorable condition, but the utilization coefficient of this workshop was only in the seventies before July. Now, the equipment conditions have not changed, but the utilization coefficient has increased to over ninety. How do the condition-only theorists explain this?

    The workers of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant say it well: "Steel must be smelted, and people must also be steeled." The dynamic role of people is a powerful factor in creating and changing conditions. If we fail to see this point, everything will become incomprehensible.

### 转炉工人，急起直追！

    转炉工人，急起直追！
    上钢一厂第一转炉车间高举起一面转炉红旗。我们看到转炉上出现了高产红旗，感到无比的欢欣。
    今年全国各地新建的现代化炼钢炉极大多数是转炉，而利用系数一般还不高，有的每公称吨一昼夜产钢在四五十吨以下，上钢一厂的转炉却提高到九十吨以上，这不能不是转炉生产上的一件大事。
    怎样看待这件大事呢？能不能急起直追，夺取这样的高产纪录呢？有人说，不能，因为这个车间用的是酸性转炉，专用好料炼钢。而目前我国大量兴建的是碱性转炉，用料坏。固然，上钢一厂用的生铁原料好，是一个有利条件，但这个车间在7月份以前的利用系数只有七十几，现在设备条件并没有变，而利用系数则提高到九十以上，试问唯条件论者又作何解答呢？
    上钢一厂的工人说得好：“钢要炼，人也要炼”，人的能动作用是创造条件改变条件的有力因素，看不到这点，一切事情就会不可理解了。
