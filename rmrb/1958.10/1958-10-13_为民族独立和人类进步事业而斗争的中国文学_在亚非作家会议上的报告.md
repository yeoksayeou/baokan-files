Chinese Literature Fighting for National Independence and Human Progress
—Report at the Asian-African Writers' Conference
Mao Dun

Our Chinese writers' delegation comes to this conference with excitement and pride. Asia and Africa were once the birthplaces of great human civilizations, and our people of all countries have made brilliant contributions to human culture. It is a further symbol of the great unity of the Asian and African people that Asian and African writers can gather together today to hold such a conference. We would like to extend our most sincere congratulations to the conference—an unprecedented grand gathering of Asian and African writers.

We gather today in this beautiful city of Tashkent, and we cannot help but recall the world-famous "Silk Road" that passed through Uzbekistan. As early as the sixth century BC, the people of Uzbekistan, the people of Central Asia, Syria, Afghanistan, Persia, and China worked diligently and arduously together to open up this road connecting East Asia and West Asia. In the second century BC, the Chinese explorer Zhang Qian visited various countries in Central Asia and West Asia via the "Silk Road," opening up cultural exchange relations between China and the countries of West Asia. Later, the Chinese people also established peaceful and friendly cultural exchange relations with almost all countries and nations in Asia and Africa through maritime transportation. As early as two thousand years ago, monks from Kangju (located in present-day Samarkand, Uzbekistan), Yuezhi (in the Amu Darya River basin of Turkmenistan), and Parthia (Iran) first introduced Indian Buddhism into China. In the first century AD, we translated Indian Buddhist scriptures into Chinese. The two eminent monks, Fa Xian, who went to India to seek scriptures in the fifth century, and Xuanzang, who went in the seventh century, are well known to the world, and they left behind great achievements in Sino-Indian cultural exchange.

The exchanges between China and Egypt began as early as the sixth century BC. China has had two thousand years of history of interactions with Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Burma. As for the history of cultural exchange between China and Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, Ceylon, Thailand, and other Asian and African countries, it began in the second century, or at the latest in the early seventh century. These friendly exchanges have enabled us to influence each other in culture and art and to understand, trust, and rely on each other in friendship.

Dear friends, please forgive me for making such wonderful and long-standing historical recollections, because, in contrast to these exciting traditional friendships, we cannot help but feel extremely indignant when we think of the common disasters we have all suffered in the past century. As we all know, since the sixteenth century, the shadow of colonialism has come to the East, and the peaceful and friendly cultural exchange relations between our countries have begun to be destroyed. Colonialism brought cultural aggression! After the eighteenth century, many of us were forced to accept other people's so-called "civilization" and were falsely accused of being "backward" as a nation, and our own literary treasures were excluded from the world's literary treasure house. Colonialists always want to undermine the unity of the people and cultural exchanges between the countries they enslave. Therefore, the work of introducing and translating these treasures among ourselves has been hindered, so much so that at today's conference, we still have to introduce our own literary history to each other like new friends, which cannot but be the greatest regret!

China's great writers and poets throughout history have been warriors who loved truth, loved the people, loved peace, and opposed aggression. Their works are precisely what those colonialists hate.

Dear friends, please allow me to take Chinese literature as an example. In the fifth century BC, we collected and edited a general collection of poems dating back to the eleventh century BC: "The Book of Songs." This is the oldest source of China's excellent literary tradition. The lyrical epic "Li Sao" by China's greatest poet Qu Yuan (340-278 BC) is an immortal work and a model for Chinese poets of all dynasties for more than two thousand years. After Qu Yuan, we continued to produce countless great writers such as Sima Qian, Tao Yuanming, Du Fu, Li Bai, Bai Juyi, Wang Shifu, Guan Hanqing, Shi Nai'an, Luo Guanzhong, Wu Jingzi, Cao Xueqin, and so on. Their works have always been loved and treasured by the Chinese people, shining with immortal brilliance. These works are rare treasures in the world's literary treasure house, but why haven't they achieved their due status in the world's literary treasure house, like many classical masterpieces in Asia and Africa?

The reason is very simple. Like the truly great writers of any country in the world, these great writers and poets of China are warriors who love truth, love the people, love peace, and oppose aggression. Their works are precisely what those colonialists who used force to invade other countries and oppress the people of other countries hated.

While destroying Oriental culture, Western colonialists exported "new" "culture." What kind of "works" were these in literature? As our great Chinese writer Lu Xun said, they were "stories of detectives, adventurers, English girls, and African 'barbarians,' 'works' that can only scratch an itch on a bloated body after getting drunk and full." They were "works" that demoralized the oppressed. After World War II, some new things were added, namely American swing dances and American pornographic movies that made people even more depraved and degenerate.

But the East has awakened! Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the people of Asia and Africa have risen up to fight to get rid of colonial rule! Asian and African writers have also made outstanding contributions to creating their own new literature under the historical demands of defending peace, safeguarding national independence, and opposing colonialism. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the Chinese people launched a revolutionary movement in 1919 against imperialist aggression and domestic feudal warlords, which was the famous "May Fourth" Movement. China's New Literature Movement was born at the same time as one wing of the Chinese People's Revolution. Our modern great writer Lu Xun was the founder of this New Literature Movement. Then the Communist Party of China was founded, and under the leadership of the Party, China's New Literature Movement flourished with a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal spirit.

The thirty years of Chinese New Literature from 1919 to 1949 were consistently permeated with a red line with anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism as the theme. Moreover, this anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism were two inseparable aspects of a complete theme. Lu Xun's works and the works of Guo Moruo and many other well-known writers became revolutionary horns at that time, mobilizing a large number of educated youths to join the revolutionary ranks. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, their literary works became powerful weapons to combat Japanese and American imperialism and their running dogs and defend national independence. During these thirty years, Chinese writers, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, were with the Chinese people and gloriously completed the great cause of safeguarding national independence and liberating the whole of China. This is something that Chinese writers are proud of.

In 1949, the People's Republic of China was born, and Chinese literature entered a new stage. But this new stage had already begun in 1942 with Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This "Talks" is the literary direction that Chinese writers have followed together for the past sixteen years. Many friends have already read this "Talks," so there is no need for me to give a detailed introduction. Its most basic spirit is that writers must combine with the working people, and literature must serve the working people. This is a further development of the New Literature since the "May Fourth" Movement. Since 1942, many writers have lived, breathed, and shared the joys and sorrows of the working masses. This has resulted in Zhao Shuli's novels "The Rhymes of Li Youcai" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," Zhou Libo's novel "Hurricane," Li Ji's long poem "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," and He Jingzhi and Ding Yi's opera "The White-Haired Girl," and so on. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, there were also novels "Sanliwan Village" (Zhao Shuli), "Sparks Ahead" (Liu Baiyu), "Defend Yan'an" (Du Pengcheng), reportage "Dedicate Everything to the Party" (Wu Yunduo), plays "Across a Thousand Mountains and Rivers" (Chen Qitong), "Dragon Beard Ditch" (Lao She), "A Bright Sky" (Cao Yu), and so on.

The above-mentioned works are a brand-new socialist literature. Using the language and emotions of the people, they sing the praises of the people's struggles and victories, courage and wit, hard work and creation, and reflect the panoramic view of the great changes in the new China during its creation and after its establishment. Therefore, they are deeply loved by the masses of people and have also educated the masses of people. The general printing numbers of these works are in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even more than three million copies, which is the best proof.

Friends, China is a multi-ethnic country. In addition to the Han people, all our ethnic minorities have their own extremely rich literary heritage. As early as the third and fourth centuries, the Uyghur people created the beautiful long poem "Towadua." The Mongolian people also produced the epic "The Story of Gesar" in the early eleventh century. Tibetan literature began to develop from the ninth century, and its long-standing dramatic literature is extremely distinctive. The Dai people's orally transmitted "O Bian · Samluo" is an ancient narrative poem of love tragedy. The Yi people's long poem "Meige," with more than eleven thousand lines, is also an orally transmitted epic about the origin of mankind and the struggle against nature. In addition, other ethnic minorities have their own rich and beautiful legends, narrative poems, and folk literature. After the founding of the new China, all ethnic groups are sorting out and publishing these literary heritages, and many have been translated into Chinese. The new literature of ethnic minorities is also flourishing, and new and outstanding writers have emerged. Mongolian poet Na. Saiyinchaoketu, Uyghur playwright Zulun Kader, etc. are also well-known throughout China, and their works are an important part of contemporary Chinese literature.

Chinese literature is now entering a new period of unprecedented upsurge. Almost all factories and rural areas across the country are filled with poetry. This year's creative harvest has also been particularly rich.

Dear friends, please allow me to introduce the development of Chinese literature in the past year. Because this year is an earth-shattering year, a year of constant mythical miracles. China's economic construction has shown the heroic posture of the Great Leap Forward. One miracle after another has appeared on the agricultural and industrial production fronts. The great Uzbek poet Alisher Navoi, in his famous poem "Farhad and Shirin," wrote the male protagonist as a Chinese prince. The poet praised the prince's labor in this way: "What he does in a day, no one can finish in three years." Regarding his "superhuman power," the poet could not help but exclaim: "...not just strength, but also a high degree of art! No! The world has never seen such a miracle!" The poet Navoi has truly become a prophet! It's just that the Chinese prince has become ordinary Chinese workers and farmers. From October last year to April this year, the water conservancy projects built by the peasants themselves across the country have expanded the irrigated area by 350 million mu, which is 110 million mu more than the total irrigated area achieved in the thousands of years before liberation! The highest yield of rice per mu in one season has reached more than 60,000 jin! This year's total grain output will double last year's! Steel production will jump from more than 5 million tons last year to more than 10 million tons! From this autumn, agricultural production cooperatives across the country have voluntarily merged and established people's communes. This movement is booming. It is estimated that this winter and next spring, people's communes will be universally established in rural areas across the country!

Literature has entered a new period of unprecedented upsurge in such a historical background. First of all, there is the upsurge of the mass literary movement. Since the spring of this year, almost all factories and rural areas across the country have been filled with a warm literary atmosphere, and there is poetry everywhere. The poet Guo Moruo visited a rural area rich in fruit trees. The walls or doors of the entire rural area were covered with poems and paintings created by the farmers themselves. Guo Moruo couldn't help but write the poem "Ten thousand fruit trees are planted in the garden, ten thousand poems are written on the walls." Such "poetry villages" can be seen everywhere. Many agricultural cooperatives have established creative writing groups. In factories and mines, workers have also established their own literary organizations, and some factories have a creative writing group in each workshop. In addition to poetry, workers have also written many novels, plays, and works in folk literary forms. Because these works are directly produced from labor, especially produced in the overwhelming Great Leap Forward in production, and they inherit the tradition of ancient Chinese literature. Therefore, they have true and simple labor emotions, a magnificent and heroic spirit, and an optimistic spirit. A worker said: "Where there is labor, there is poetry." Poetry and labor are closely integrated. A farmer said in his poem: "Myths and poems are everywhere," and China has become a country of poetry!

In the past year, more than 700 writers from across the country have gone deep into rural areas, factories, mines, and the armed forces. Because they deeply know that if they do not further go deep among the people and understand the thoughts and feelings of the working people, they will not be able to depict the spiritual outlook of the working people more truthfully and perfectly in their creations, and they will not be able to reflect this earth-shattering era.

The harvest this year has also been particularly abundant: there are Zhou Libo's "Great Changes in a Mountain Village," Ai Wu's "Tempered Steel," Du Pengcheng's "In the Days of Peace," Liang Bin's "Red Flag Spectrum," Qu Bo's "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," Wu Qiang's "Red Sun," Feng Deying's "Bitter Herbs," Yang Mo's "Song of Youth," etc.; there are Tian Han's "Guan Hanqing," Jin Shan's "Red Storm," etc., and there are also many excellent one-act plays and poems. These works are full of the spirit of revolutionary heroism and have been warmly loved by the majority of readers as soon as they are published.

Chinese writers love their motherland, love the working life of the people, and also love world peace and human liberation.

Chinese writers love their motherland, love the working life of the people, and also love world peace and human liberation. Chinese writers realize that any effort they make is inseparable from consolidating and prospering their motherland and maintaining world peace and promoting human progress.

But imperialism will always be hostile to peace. When the American imperialist's aggressive hands threatened the independence of Korea and the security of China, Chinese writers stood among the people and joined hands with the Korean people to conduct a just war to safeguard national independence and defend world peace. Chinese writers wrote many outstanding works for the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea during and after the war. These works played an extremely profound role in mobilizing the people to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression. In the winter of 1956, British and French imperialism invaded Egypt. Chinese writers also joined the Chinese people in expressing their condemnation of imperialism, using their pens to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people and cheering the victory of the Egyptian people. In this struggle, Chinese writers established revolutionary friendship with Egyptian writers. On July 14 this year, the Iraqi people's revolution succeeded. Then the US and British imperialism invaded Lebanon and Jordan. The Chinese people launched an even greater revolutionary wave to support the struggle of their Arab brothers. After the news of the armed intervention of Lebanon and Jordan by the United States and Britain spread, poetry leaflets appeared on the streets of major cities across the country. Every newspaper was filled with poems and cartoons. Every literary magazine published a special issue. The walls were covered with paintings, and theaters went to the streets to perform. ... Whether it was poetry or painting, prose or theatrical performance, thousands of voices converged into a roar: "Support the Arab people! American and British troops get out of Arab countries!" Recently, American imperialism has been provoking in the Taiwan Strait region of our country, which has aroused great indignation among the people of our country and the people of the world. Now the people of the whole country have risen up to fight against the American imperialist's aggression and threats of war. More than 300 million Chinese people have participated in demonstrations. Chinese writers have also resolutely mobilized all their forces and used the weapon of literature to participate in the sacred struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace. No provocation can ever scare the Chinese people. We believe that victory must belong to the just Chinese people who defend peace.

Similarly, we also know that Asian and African writers and their people have supported the Chinese people with actions and just pens in our struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and in this struggle against American imperialism's provocations in the Taiwan Strait region. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to you here and through you to the people of Asian and African countries!

Dear friends, defending peace, safeguarding national independence, and opposing colonialism have become an irresistible great force among the people of the world. The people and writers of Asian and African countries have further established our friendly cultural relations in this solemn and great struggle. The mutual visits between writers from our countries and Asian and African countries have been greatly strengthened. In the past nine years, there have been many cultural delegations coming and going, and writers account for a large proportion of them. Literary works from Asian and African countries have also been widely disseminated in China. In the past nine years, we have translated 267 kinds of classical and modern literary works from Asian and African countries, with a total of 5 million copies printed. The Chinese people have held grand memorial services for many great writers from Asian and African countries, such as the ancient Indian poet Kalidasa and the ancient Iranian poet Sadi. Kalidasa's famous drama "Shakuntala" was also performed in Beijing. This performance was recognized as a rare success. These activities have helped us to understand the people of Asian and African countries, consolidate friendly cooperation relations, and strengthen unity. Cultural exchange between China and Asian and African countries is now not only fully restored but also unprecedentedly expanded and deepened. This has made an important contribution to peace in the Asian and African regions and the world!

But, dear friends, the Western colonialists' ambition to enslave the people of Asia and Africa has not died, and colonial culture has not been eradicated. Only if we, the people of Asian and African countries, strengthen our unity even more and finally drive away the ugly shadow of colonialism can we lay the foundation for the peaceful and friendly cooperation relations between Asian and African countries for all ages. As the most outstanding representatives of the people of all countries, let us, Asian and African writers, first unite closely! The Lebanese poet Youssef Saïd sings well in his "The Baker":
	We must unite for a common destiny,
	Otherwise, others will bully and oppress us,
	Let our working hands be forever clenched together,
	Brothers, let us fight side by side.

Our conference is a conference of literary exchange, a conference of unity. Let us congratulate:
Long live the friendly unity of the people of Asian and African countries!
Long live the unity of writers from Asian and African countries!
Long live Asian-African and world peace!

    为民族独立和人类进步事业而斗争的中国文学
    ——在亚非作家会议上的报告
    茅盾
    我们中国作家代表团以兴奋而自豪的心情来参加这个大会。亚洲和非洲曾经是人类伟大文明的发祥地，我们各国人民都曾对人类文化有过辉煌的贡献，亚非作家今天能共聚一堂，举行这样的大会，这是亚非人民大团结的又一象征。我们谨向大会——历史上空前的亚非作家大团结的盛会，表示最最真诚的祝贺。
    我们今天在这个美丽城市塔什干集会，首先不能不回忆起举世闻名的、在乌兹别克境内通过的“丝绸之路”。远在纪元前六世纪，由于乌兹别克人民和中亚细亚各国人民，以及叙利亚、阿富汗、波斯、中国人民共同的辛勤艰苦劳动，开辟了这条沟通东亚与西亚的道路。公元前二世纪，中国探险家张骞经由“丝绸之路”访问了中亚和西亚各国。开辟了中国和西亚各国间的文化交流关系。后来中国人民又通过海上交通，和亚非的所有国家、民族几乎都建立了文化交流的和平友好关系。远在两千年前，位于今日乌兹别克撒马儿罕的康居国的僧人，和月支国（在土库曼的阿姆河流域地方）、安息国（伊朗）的僧人们就首先把印度的佛教传入了中国。公元一世纪间，我们就用汉文翻译了印度的佛经。五世纪前往印度求经的法显和七世纪的玄奘两位法师是世所周知的，他们在中印文化交流上留下了伟大的业绩。
    中国和埃及的往还远在公元前六世纪就开始了。中国和日本、朝鲜、越南、缅甸的交往，都有了两千年的历史。至于和印度尼西亚、柬埔寨、老挝、尼泊尔、锡兰、泰国以及其他亚非国家间的文化交流历史，远在二世纪，最迟到七世纪初年也都先后开始了。这些友好往还，使得我们在文化艺术上相互影响，使得我们在友谊上相互了解，相互信赖。
    亲爱的朋友们，请原谅我作这样美好的历史悠久的回忆，因为，对照着这些使人兴奋的传统友谊，我们不能不愤慨万分地想起了近百年来我们大家所曾经共同蒙受的祸害。我们都知道，自从十六世纪以后，殖民主义的魔影来到了东方，我们各国之间和平友好的文化交流关系就开始被破坏了。殖民主义带来了文化侵略！十八世纪以后，我们中间许多国家被强迫着接受别人的所谓“文明”，而硬被诬蔑自己的民族为“落后”，我们自己的文学宝藏被摈弃在世界文学宝库之外。殖民主义者总是要破坏其所奴役的国家之间的人民团结和文化交流。因此，我们之间相互介绍翻译这些宝藏的工作就受到阻碍，以至于到今天的大会上，我们还要新朋友似地相互介绍自己的文学历史，这不能不是最大的遗憾！
    中国历来的伟大作家和诗人，都是热爱真理、热爱人民、热爱和平而反对侵略的战士。他们的作品正是那些殖民主义者所痛恨的。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我以中国文学为例。我们在公元前五世纪就搜集、编辑了一部上溯到公元前十一世纪的诗歌的总集：“诗经”。这是中国文学优良传统的最古的源头。中国最伟大的诗人屈原（公元前340—278）的抒情长诗“离骚”是一部不朽之作，是二千多年来中国历代诗人的典范。屈原以后，我们还不断地产生了像司马迁、陶渊明、杜甫、李白、白居易、王实甫、关汉卿、施耐庵、罗贯中、吴敬梓、曹雪芹等等数之不尽的伟大作家，他们的作品一直都为中国人民所喜爱珍藏，发着不灭的光芒。这些作品都是世界文学宝库中的奇珍异宝，但它们和亚非国家许多古典名著一样，没有在世界文学宝库中取得其应有的地位，这是为什么呢？
    原因很简单。和世界上任何国家的真正伟大作家一样，中国这些伟大作家和诗人，都是热爱真理，热爱人民，热爱和平而反对侵略的战士。他们的作品正是那些以武力侵略别的国家，压迫别国人民的殖民主义者所痛恨的。
    与摧毁东方文化的同时，西方殖民者输出了“新”的“文化”。在文学方面是些什么“作品”呢？正如我们中国大作家鲁迅所说的，是“包探，冒险家，英国姑娘，非洲‘野蛮’的故事，是只能醉饱之后，在发胀的身体上搔搔痒的”“作品”。是使被压迫者精神堕落的“作品”。二次世界大战以后又增加了一些新东西，那就是使人更加下流、堕落的美国摇摆舞和美国的黄色电影。
    但东方觉醒了！从二十世纪初亚非人民开始为摆脱殖民统治而起来斗争了！亚非各国作家也在保卫和平、维护民族独立的反殖民主义的历史要求下，为创造自己的新文学而作出卓越的贡献。中国人民在十月革命的影响之下，于1919年爆发了反对帝国主义侵略和国内封建军阀的革命运动，这就是著名的“五四”运动。中国的新文学运动就作为中国人民革命的一翼而与之同时诞生。我国近代伟大作家鲁迅，便是这一新文学运动的奠基人。接着中国共产党成立，中国的新文学运动在党的领导下，以彻底的反帝、反封建的精神蓬勃发展起来。
    1919—1949三十年间的中国新文学，自始至终贯串着一根以反帝、反封建为主题的红线。而且这反帝和反封建是一个完整主题的不可分割的两面。鲁迅的作品和郭沫若以及其他许多知名作家的作品一样，成为当时的革命号角，曾经动员了广大知识青年参加革命队伍。特别是在抗日战争和解放战争时期，他们的文学作品成为打击日、美帝国主义及其走狗，保卫民族独立的有力武器。在这三十年间中国作家在中国共产党领导之下，和中国人民在一起，光荣地完成了维护民族独立和解放全中国的伟大事业。这是中国作家引以自豪的。
    1949年，中华人民共和国诞生了，中国文学进入了新的阶段。但这新的阶段是早在1942年毛泽东主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”就开始了的。这个“讲话”是十六年来中国作家所共同遵循的文学方向。这个“讲话”很多朋友们已经读过，无需我作详尽的介绍。它的最基本的精神，就是作家必须与劳动人民相结合，文学必须为劳动人民服务。这是“五四”以来新文学的进一步发展。1942年以来许多作家和劳动群众同生活、共呼吸、达到了休戚相关、欢乐与共的关系。这样就产生了赵树理的小说“李有才板话”和“小二黑结婚”，周立波的小说“暴风骤雨”，李季的长诗“王贵与李香香”，贺敬之、丁毅的歌剧“白毛女”等等。1949年中华人民共和国成立后，又产生了小说“三里湾”（赵树理）、“火光在前”（刘白羽）、“保卫延安”（杜鹏程），报告文学“把一切献给党”（吴运铎），剧本“万水千山”（陈其通）、“龙须沟”（老舍）、“明朗的天”（曹禺）等等。
    上述这些作品，是一种崭新的社会主义的文学，它以人民群众的语言和感情，歌颂了人民的斗争和胜利、勇敢和机智、艰苦的奋斗和创造，反映了新中国在创造中和建立后大变革面貌的全景。因此它们为人民群众所深深热爱，也教育了人民群众。它们一般的印行数字都在几万册、几十万册甚至三百万册以上，就是最好的证明。
    朋友们，中国是个多民族的国家，除了汉族以外，我们所有的少数民族都各自有其极为丰富的文学遗产。维吾尔族人民远在第三、四世纪就创造了优美的长诗“托瓦杜瓦”。蒙古人民也在十一世纪初就产生了史诗“格斯尔的故事”。藏族文学从九世纪起即开始发展，它的历史悠久的戏剧文学是极富特色的。傣族口头流传的“俄变·撒木落”是一首古老的恋爱悲剧叙事诗。彝族的一万一千余行长诗“梅葛”，也是口头流传的关于人类来历及对大自然斗争的史诗。此外的少数民族都有自己的丰富优美的传说、叙事诗和民间文学。新中国成立后，各民族都在整理、出版这些文学遗产，有许多已经译成了汉文。少数民族新的文学也在蓬勃发展中，都产生了新的优秀的作家。蒙族诗人纳·赛音朝克图，维吾尔族剧作家祖隆·卡得尔等在全中国也很知名，他们的作品是当前中国文学重要的组成部分。
    中国文学现在进入新的空前高涨的时期。几乎全国所有的工厂和农村，到处都是诗。这一年来创作上的收获也特别丰盛。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我再介绍一下中国文学最近一年的发展。因为这一年是惊天动地的一年，是神话式的奇迹不断出现的一年。我国的经济建设出现了大跃进的雄姿。在农业和工业生产战线上一个奇迹接着一个奇迹出现了。乌兹别克大诗人阿里谢尔·纳瓦伊，在他著名诗篇“法尔哈德和希琳”里他把男主角写成是中国的一位王子。对于这位王子，诗人是这样赞美他的劳动的：“他一天当中所做的事情，任何人三个年头都做不尽。”对于他的“超人的力量”，诗人又不禁加以这样的惊叹：“……不只是力量，还是高度的艺术！不！全世界还从未见过这样的奇迹！”诗人纳瓦伊真成了预言家！只不过中国王子变为中国的普通工人和农民罢了。从去年10月到今年4月，全国农民自己兴修的水利，扩大了灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，比解放以前几千年间所达到的灌溉总面积还多一亿一千万亩！一亩地一季稻子的最高产量已经达到六万斤以上！今年粮食总产量将比去年增加一倍！钢的生产从去年的五百多万吨一跃而将超过一千万吨！从今年秋天起，全国农业生产合作社纷纷自动并社，建立了人民公社。这个运动正在蓬勃发展，估计今冬明春，人民公社将在全国农村普遍建立起来！
    文学就在这样的历史背景上，进入新的空前高涨时期，首先是群众文学运动的高涨，从今年春天起，几乎全国所有工厂和农村都充满了热烈的文艺气氛，到处都是诗。诗人郭沫若访问了一个盛产果木的农村，在整个农村的墙壁或门户上，贴满了农民自己创作的诗和画。郭沫若不禁写下了“万株果树种满园，万首诗歌写满墙”的诗句，这样的“诗村”到处可见。许多农业合作社都成立了创作组。在工矿中，工人们也建立起自己的文学组织，有的工厂每个车间都有一个创作组。除了诗歌以外，工人们还写了不少的小说、剧本和民间文学形式的作品。这些作品由于它是直接从劳动中产生的，特别是在排山倒海的生产大跃进中产生的，而它又继承了中国古代文学传统。因此它具有真实而朴素的劳动感情，具有一种雄伟而豪迈的气概和乐观主义精神。有个工人说：“哪里有劳动，哪里就有诗。”诗和劳动紧密结合起来了。一个农民在他的诗里说：“遍地神话遍地诗”，中国成为一个诗国了！
    最近一年来，全国有七百多作家深入到农村、工矿、部队中去。因为他们深深知道，如果不进一步深入人民中间，理解劳动人民的思想感情，将无法在创作上更真实、更完美地描绘出劳动人民的精神面貌，也就无法反映出这个惊天动地的时代。
    这一年的收获也就特别丰盛：长篇小说有周立波的“山乡巨变”，艾芜的“百炼成钢”，杜鹏程的“在和平的日子里”，梁斌的“红旗谱”，曲波的“林海雪原”，吴强的“红日”，冯德英的“苦菜花”，杨沫的“青春之歌”等；戏剧有田汉的“关汉卿”，金山的“红色风暴”等，此外还有许多优秀的独幕剧和诗歌。这些作品充满了革命英雄主义的精神，一出版立刻受到广大读者的热烈喜爱。
    中国作家热爱自己的祖国，热爱人民的劳动生活，也热爱世界和平和人类解放。
    中国作家热爱自己的祖国，热爱人民的劳动生活，也热爱世界和平和人类解放，中国作家们意识到自己的任何一个努力，都是与巩固和繁荣自己的祖国及维护世界和平促进人类的进步分不开的。
    但帝国主义是永远敌视和平的。当美帝的侵略魔手威胁到朝鲜的独立和中国的安全的时候，中国作家站在人民中间和朝鲜人民并肩携手，为维护民族独立、保卫世界和平而进行了正义的战争。中国作家在战争时期及以后为抗美援朝所写下许多杰出的作品。这些作品对动员人民保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争都起了极其刻深的作用，1956年冬，英法帝国主义侵略埃及，中国作家也和中国人民一起表示了对帝国主义的声讨，以自己的笔声援埃及人民的正义斗争，欢呼埃及人民的胜利。在这次斗争中，中国作家与埃及作家建立了革命的友谊，今年7月14日伊拉克人民革命成功，接着美英帝国主义侵略黎巴嫩和约旦，中国人民掀起更为巨大的革命浪潮来支援阿拉伯兄弟的斗争。在美、英帝国主义武装干涉黎、约消息传到以后，全国各大城市的街头就出现了诗传单，每一张报纸上都充满了诗和漫画，每一个文艺杂志都出了特辑，墙头上画满了画，剧院都到街头演出，……不论是诗或画，散文或戏剧演出，千千万万的声音汇成一声怒吼：“支援阿拉伯人民！美英军队滚出阿拉伯国家去！”最近美帝国主义在我国台湾海峡地区进行挑衅，这已激起我国人民和世界人民巨大的愤慨，现在全国人民已经起来，为反对美帝国主义的侵略行动和战争威胁而斗争，三亿以上中国人民参加了示威，中国作家也已经坚决调动一切力量，运用文学的武器，投入保卫祖国，保卫和平的神圣斗争，任何挑衅都绝对吓不倒中国人民。我们相信，胜利一定属于正义的、保卫和平的中国人民。
    同样，我们也知道：亚非各国作家和他们的人民一道，在我国抗美援朝斗争中，以及这次反对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行挑衅的斗争中，都曾以行动和正义的笔支援过中国人民。我们在此向你们，并通过你们向亚非各国人民表示衷心的感谢！
    亲爱的朋友们，保卫和平，维护民族独立，反对殖民主义，已经成为全世界人民中不可抗拒的伟大力量，亚非各国人民和作家在这个庄严的伟大的斗争中，更进一步建立了我们友好的文化关系。我们和亚非各国之间作家的相互访问大大加强了，九年来相互来往的文化代表团非常多，其中作家占了很大的比重。亚非各国文学作品也在中国得到了广泛的传播。九年间，我们翻译了二百六十七种亚非各国古典的和现代的文学作品，印行总数达到五百万册。对于亚非国家的许多伟大作家如印度的古代诗人迦梨陀娑和伊朗的古诗人萨迪，中国人民都曾经举行过隆重的纪念会。迦梨陀娑的名剧“沙恭达罗”并曾在北京演出，这次演出被公认为难得的成功，这些活动帮助了我们对亚非各国人民的了解，巩固了相互间友好合作关系，加强了团结，中国和亚非国家的文化交流工作现在不仅完全恢复，而且空前扩大了，愈益深入了。这对于亚非地区以至世界的和平有了重要的贡献！
    但是，亲爱的朋友们，西方殖民主义者奴役亚非人民的野心未死，殖民文化尚未根除，我们亚非各国人民只有更加强团结，最后赶走殖民主义这个丑恶的魔影，才能为亚非各国之间和平友好合作关系奠定万世的基础。作为各国人民最优秀的代表的亚非作家们，让我们首先紧紧地团结起来吧！黎巴嫩诗人尤素夫·萨依德在他的“面包师”里歌唱得好：
        我们应当为共同的命运团结起来，
        否则别人会把我们欺凌压迫，
        让我们劳动的手永远紧握在一起，
        兄弟，让我们并肩作战。
    我们的大会是文学交流大会，是团结大会，让我们祝贺：
    亚非各国人民友好团结万岁！
    亚非各国作家团结万岁！
    亚非和世界和平万岁！
