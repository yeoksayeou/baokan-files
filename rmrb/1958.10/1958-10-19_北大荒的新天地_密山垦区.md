The Mishan Reclamation Area is one of the two major reclamation areas in the Great Northern Wilderness, located in the eastern part of the Great Northern Wilderness. It includes Mishan, Hulin, Baoqing, and Raohe counties in Heilongjiang Province, as well as parts of nearby counties, covering a total area of approximately 50,000 square kilometers, with 15 million mu of reclaimable land. The frost-free period here is about 140 days throughout the year, with the freezing period starting in early November and the thawing period in late March. The eastern edge of the reclamation area is separated from the Soviet Union by a river. Most of the reclamation area consists of large plains formed by the alluvial deposits of the Heilongjiang, Songhua River, and Ussuri River converging. The soil of the plains is very fertile, with a black soil layer generally three chi deep, and in some areas five or six chi deep. The newly reclaimed land appears as a vast expanse of black oil. This fertile land is not only suitable for planting soybeans, wheat, rice, corn, sorghum, and potatoes, but also for cultivating cash crops such as sugar beets and flax.

The reclamation area not only has fertile fields, but also mountains, forests, water, and grasslands. In addition to the three major rivers mentioned above, there are also Xingkai Lake, Small Xingkai Lake, Muling River, Shanghulin River, Hamatong River, and other waterways. The water from these rivers and lakes can be used for power generation and irrigation. These rivers and lakes are also rich in various types of fish, including the famous chum salmon, which comes from the Ussuri River here.

The Wanda Mountains is a large mountain range that runs through the reclamation area. This mountain has dense forests, with forest by-products available for harvesting and hunting such as ginseng, agaric, tigers, deer, bears, and sable foxes. The Wanda Mountains also provides various resources for our industrial development. According to surveys, there are reserves of gold, tin, copper, and other rare metals here. The reserves of coal, kerosene, and oil shale in this area are also very large.

There are also many lush natural pastures in the area north and south of the Wanda Mountains. The famous Mudanjiang Stud Farm is located here.

The Mishan Reclamation Area has been established for more than two years. In the summer of 1956, more than 10,000 demobilized soldiers from the railway corps moved here and began large-scale mechanized land reclamation and agricultural production. In 1957, 1.71 million mu of land was reclaimed and 1.08 million mu were sown. At the same time, fourteen farms and ranches of varying sizes were established. This spring, another 60,000 demobilized soldiers came to the reclamation area. 1958 is a year of the Great Leap Forward. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and with the addition of a large number of new forces, the Mishan Reclamation Area will reclaim 4.5 million mu of land and begin to establish various industrial and sideline productions. This wasteland, which has been dormant for thousands of years, has been awakened by these people who are soldiers, workers, and farmers. Dear readers: We are now reporting to you on behalf of this land: The Great Northern Wilderness is no longer desolate! (Attached image)

### 北大荒的新天地——密山垦区

    北大荒的新天地——密山垦区
    密山垦区是北大荒的两大垦区的一个，这个垦区在北大荒的东半部。包括黑龙江省的密山、虎林、宝清、饶河四县和附近各县的部分地区，总面积约有五万平方公里，可垦荒地有一千五百万亩。这里全年无霜期有一百四十天左右，结冻期在11月上旬，解冻期在3月下旬。垦区的东部边缘和苏联只有一江之隔。垦区的大部分地区都是黑龙江、松花江、乌苏里江“三江汇流”冲积成的一块块的大平原。平原的土壤十分肥沃，黑土层一般有三市尺深，有些地区五、六尺深。新开垦出来的土地，望去是黑油油的一片。这块千里沃土上不但适合种植大豆、小麦、水稻、玉米、高粱、马铃薯，而且可以栽培甜菜、亚麻等经济作物。
    垦区不仅有千里沃野，同时还有山、有林、有水、有草。垦区除了前面说的三条大江以外还有兴凯湖、小兴凯湖、穆棱河、上虎林河、哈马通河等水流，这些大小江河的水可以发电，可以灌溉。这些江河湖泊还盛产各种鱼类，有名的大马哈鱼，就出自这里的乌苏里江。
    完达山是一条横贯垦区境内的大山。这座山有茂密的森林，有人参、木耳、虎、鹿、熊、种狐等可供采猎的森林副业产品。完达山还为我们发展工业准备了各种资源。据调查，这里储藏有金、锡、铜和其他稀有金属。这个地区的煤、煤油、油母页岩的储量也很大。
    完达山南北一带还有不少水草丰美的天然牧场，有名的牡丹江种畜场就在这里。
    密山垦区已经建立两年多了。1956年夏季一万多铁道兵的复员官兵进住到这里，开始了大规模机械垦荒和农业生产。1957年垦荒一百七十一万亩，播种一百零八万亩，同时建立了十四个大小不等的农牧场。今年春天垦区又来了六万名转业军人。1958年是大跃进的一年，密山垦区在党的社会主义建设总路线光辉照耀下，再加上有了大批的生力军，垦荒的面积将达到四百五十万亩，并开始建立了各种工业、副业生产。这块沉睡了千万年的荒地，被这些是兵、是工、也是农的人们叫醒了。亲爱的读者们：我们现在替这块大地向你们汇报：北大荒现在已经开始不荒了。（附图片）
