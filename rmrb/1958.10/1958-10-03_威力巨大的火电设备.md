Xinhua News Agency, Harbin – China's first complete set of 25,000-kilowatt high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power generation equipment was successfully trial-produced on the 29th. This is a gift from the workers of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, Boiler Factory, and Turbine Factory to celebrate National Day. The successful manufacturing of this set of equipment marks a new stage in China's electrical machinery manufacturing industry, entering the era of independently manufacturing complete sets of modern, large-scale thermal power station equipment.

This large thermal power generation equipment consists of a 230-ton high-pressure boiler, a 25,000-kilowatt high-temperature, high-pressure, high-speed steam turbine, and a turbo generator. The electricity it generates is sufficient to supply a steel plant with an annual output of one million tons of steel or six textile mills with one hundred thousand spindles, and can also provide lighting for a city of 1.5 million people. This high-temperature and high-pressure power generation equipment has good performance, high efficiency, and a very high coal utilization rate. It can save approximately 160,000 tons of coal per year compared to medium-temperature and medium-pressure thermal power generation equipment of the same capacity. After operational testing, the equipment is running very well. With the support of 55 factories across the country, including the Shanghai Turbine Factory and Shanghai Third Steel Plant, and the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, they finally realized their wish on the 29th.

    威力巨大的火电设备
    新华社哈尔滨电　我国第一套二万五千瓩的高温高压火力发电设备，在29日全部试制成功。这是哈尔滨电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂的职工合作向国庆节献出的礼品。这套设备的制造成功，标志着我国电机制造工业进入了自行制造成套现代化大型热电站设备的新阶段。
    这套大型火力发电设备，由二百三十吨的高压锅炉、二万五千瓩的高温高压高速汽轮机和汽轮发电机组成。它发出的电力，足可供一座年产一百万吨钢的炼钢厂或六座十万纱锭的纺织厂用，也可供一百五十万人口的城市照明用。这套高温高压发电设备的性能好，效率高，煤的利用率很高，比同样容量的中温中压火力发电设备每年可节约煤炭十六万吨左右。这套设备经过运转试验，运行情况很好。他们在上海汽轮机厂、上海第三钢厂等全国五十五个工厂的支援和苏联专家热忱指导下，终于在29日实现了他们的愿望。
