    To Factories, To the Countryside, To Construction Sites, To Fisheries
    Finding Various Ways to Combine Education with Labor
    Shanghai's Universities and Colleges Link Up with Various Production Departments According to Their Professional Characteristics
    (Our Correspondents Chen Xiangdong and Yu Huiyin report) After half a year of exploration and practice, various types of universities and colleges in Shanghai have found ways to combine their professional characteristics and implement the policy of education serving politics and education combining with productive labor. As this new semester has just begun, each school has adopted new measures to further implement this policy.
    The productive labor in which engineering students participate can generally be combined with their major. However, in the past, productive labor and classroom teaching have not been organically combined. Starting this semester, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Tongji University, East China Institute of Chemical Technology, Textile Engineering Institute, Shanghai Fisheries College, and other engineering universities and colleges, in addition to organizing students to take turns going to factories, rural areas, construction sites, and fisheries to labor and study in production practice, some professional courses, especially process courses, instructors also went to the production site with the students, combined with the students' labor to conduct teaching. In addition to teaching, teachers also guide or labor together with the students. The teaching of the transferred courses broke the past convention, the teaching content is to learn what to do, teach what is lacking; teachers no longer read from the textbook, but adopt various new teaching methods such as lectures on key technologies and theoretical issues, and technical innovation discussion meetings. Some schools not only have teachers lecturing, but also students participating in lecturing. Students participating in production labor in different departments and types of work compile teaching materials based on their practical experience and learning experiences, and teach each other.
    In the past, a major problem in work-study programs in humanities and social sciences was how to ensure that students received labor training and improved teaching quality. The Department of Philosophy at Fudan University provided a good way in this regard. From March of this year, all students and some teachers in this department began to participate in labor in rural areas of Zhejiang, and combined labor to conduct investigations and research, summarize experience, and learn how to use dialectical materialism to analyze problems encountered in practice. In the past six months, they have proposed more than 2,000 philosophical research topics, written more than 300 papers of various sizes, and also carried out philosophical popularization work in rural areas, helping farmers organize more than 20 philosophical study groups. These groups have recently developed into a farmers' philosophy academy. At present, the departments of economics, political science and law, and journalism at Fudan University and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences are also adopting this approach, organizing teachers and students to participate in productive labor in rural areas and factories in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and other places for half a year to a year, and at the same time, combined with their professional knowledge, to participate in agricultural social economic surveys, rural class struggle surveys, and run rural and factory tabloids and other practical work. While participating in labor in factories and rural areas, students from East China Normal University and Shanghai Normal College also assisted these units in running various spare-time industrial and agricultural universities and secondary schools. Art colleges have adopted a method of combining teaching with labor and artistic practice. Teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music are concentrating on one month of agricultural labor in the suburbs of Shanghai. Afterwards, they will depart for six provinces including Anhui, Shandong, and Fujian to labor, perform, study, and collect folk songs and operas.
    Students from the Shanghai First Medical College and other three medical universities and colleges, in addition to participating in labor training, also participated with teachers in the Shanghai urban area and the counties under its jurisdiction in the general survey of diseases and health conditions, organizing medical and health care networks, and establishing residential district hospitals, as a way to participate in business practice.
    In Shanghai's universities and colleges, the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor has also encountered various ideological obstacles. Some bourgeois scholars believe that work-study programs can only train laborers, not intellectuals; that combining education with productive labor will destroy the integrity and systematic nature of teaching. The facts of the double harvest of thought and study that students have gained through work-study activities in the past six months have forcefully refuted these fallacies. Since the implementation of the new measures, some good results have been seen quickly. This semester, 88 fifth-year students of the Shipbuilding Department of Jiaotong University are working as workers in the shipbuilding workshop of the Hudong Shipyard, working during the day and studying two professional courses, "Shipbuilding Technology" and "Ship Equipment and Systems," in the evening. Many problems that could not be solved in the classroom were quickly solved after the students came into contact with production practice. In the past, it took two or three class hours for teachers to explain the types and applications of gantry shears, but now it only takes 20 minutes for students to understand, because they have not only seen but also personally used this tool. In the labor, the students not only learned a lot of valuable production experience from the workers, but also combined their knowledge with the workers' production experience to make a revolution in technology. The construction technology course at Tongji University originally only taught new achievements in highly mechanized construction technology abroad, which was very different from the actual situation of construction in our country. In the past, although students put forward many opinions, requesting that the construction process be moved to the production site for teaching, most of the teachers in the construction technology teaching and research group thought it was unnecessary, thinking that doing so would make construction science not look like a science. However, six months of practice has gradually made them realize the necessity of combining education with productive labor. Now all the teachers of this teaching and research group have come to the construction site with the students, and the construction courses have also been transferred to the site with them.

    到工厂　到农村　到工地　到渔场
    找到教育同劳动结合的各种途径
    上海各高等学校结合自己专业特点同各种生产部门挂钩
    本报讯　记者陈向东、余辉音报道：经过半年的摸索和实践，上海各种类型的高等学校都找到了结合自己专业特点，贯彻教育为政治服务、教育结合生产劳动方针的途径。在这新学年刚刚开始的时候，各校都分别采取了一种新的措施，进一步贯彻这个方针。
    工科高等学校学生参加的生产劳动一般是能够结合自己专业的。但是，过去生产劳动和课堂教学二者还没有能够有机地结合起来，这学期起，上海交通大学、同济大学、华东化工学院、纺织工学院、上海水产学院等工科高等学校除了结合学生的专业，组织他们轮流到工厂、农村、工地、渔场一面劳动一面在生产实践中学习外，一部分专业课程特别是工艺性课程授课教师也随着学生一起下放到生产现场，结合学生的劳动进行教学。教师除上课外，还指导或和学生们一起劳动。下放课程的教学打破了过去的常规，教学内容是做什么学什么，缺什么教什么；教师不再照本宣读，而是采取关键性技术、理论问题讲座、技术革新讨论会等各种新的教学方式。有的学校不仅教师讲课，学生自己也参加讲课。参加不同部门、工种生产劳动的学生，根据自己的实践和学习的体会，分别编写讲义，互相上课。
    人文社会科学院系过去勤工俭学中的一个主要问题是如何使学生既受到劳动锻炼又提高教学质量。复旦大学哲学系在这方面提供了一个很好的途径。这个系的全体学生和部分教师从今年3月开始在浙江农村参加劳动，并结合劳动进行调查研究、总结经验，学习如何运用辩证唯物主义分析实践中遇到的问题，六个月来提出了二千多个哲学研究课题，写出了大小论文三百多篇，还在农村中开展了哲学普及工作，帮助农民组织了二十多个哲学学习小组，这些小组最近并发展成为一所农民哲学学院。目前复旦大学、上海社会科学院的经济、政法、新闻等系，也都采取这种作法，组织师生们到江苏、安徽和上海等地的农村和工厂参加生产劳动半年至一年，同时结合自己的专业分别参加农业社经济调查、农村阶级斗争情况调查和办农村、工厂小报等实际工作。华东师范大学和上海师范学院学生在工厂农村参加劳动的同时还协助这些单位大办各种工农业余大、中学校。艺术院校采取了教学结合劳动和艺术实践的方式。上海音乐学院师生正在上海郊区集中进行一个月的农业劳动，随后他们将出发到安徽、山东、福建等六省，边劳动，边演出，边学习，边采风。
    上海第一医学院等三所医科高等学校学生，除了参加劳动锻炼外，还和教师一道参加了上海市区与所属各县疾病与健康情况普查、组织医疗保健网、创办居民地段医院等工作，作为参加业务实践的一种方式。
    在上海高等学校里贯彻教育结合生产劳动的方针，同样遇到各种各样的思想障碍。一些资产阶级学者认为，勤工俭学只能培养劳动者，不能培养知识分子；教育结合生产劳动就会破坏教学的完整性和系统性。半年来学生们通过勤工俭学活动所获得的思想、学习两丰收的事实，已对这些谬论作了有力的驳斥。新措施执行以来，很快就已看到一些良好的效果。交通大学船舶制造系五年级八十八名学生这学期在沪东造船厂造船车间当工人，白天劳动，晚上学习“造船工艺学”和“船舶设备与系统”两门专业课。关在教室里百思不得解的许多问题，在学生们接触生产实践以后很快解决了。过去教师讲龙门剪刀车的种类和应用，需要讲二、三个学时，现在只讲了二十分钟，学生全懂了，因为他们不仅见到而且亲自用了这种工具。在劳动中，学生们不仅从工人那里学到许多宝贵的生产经验，还把自己的知识和工人的生产经验结合起来大闹技术革命。同济大学建筑施工技术课程原来只讲授国外施工技术高度机械化的新成就，和我国施工实际情况距离很远。过去虽然学生们提出很多意见，要求把施工过程搬到生产现场进行教学，建筑施工技术教研组的大多数教师却认为没有必要，认为这样做会使施工科学不像一门科学了。但是半年来的实践，使他们逐渐认识到教育结合生产劳动的必要，现在这个教研组的全体教师都和学生一道来到建筑工地，施工课程也和他们一道下放到现场了。
