Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 3rd. As winter approaches, iron smelting sites in mountainous areas of Shaanxi are making preparations for cold prevention to ensure normal iron smelting in cold weather.

Currently, in the Bashan, Qinling, and northern Shaanxi mountainous areas, some are "dressing" their indigenous blast furnaces – erecting sheds around the top of the furnace, which is conducive to maintaining furnace temperature and facilitating worker operations. Some are building grass sheds at mineral and fuel storage locations. In the simple sheds where mining and smelting workers live, some have already spread a thick and soft layer of rice straw or other crop stalks. Winter clothing and quilts needed by the workers are also being collected from each individual's family and continuously sent up the mountains by designated personnel.

It is now deep autumn, and Shaanxi is colder earlier this year than in previous years. The minimum temperature during rainfall in some mountainous areas has approached zero degrees. Workers in the mountains need to wear cotton-padded clothing in the morning and evening. Many of the people who went up the mountains for mining and smelting went before the weather turned cold and before the autumn harvest. Some places were not adequately prepared for rain and cold protection for the indigenous blast furnaces and workers. Therefore, after the weather changed, a few workers became ill due to the cold; some indigenous blast furnaces were affected in their normal iron production because of the drop in temperature and excessive moisture in the charcoal used for smelting. In response to the above situation, many counties such as Zhenba, Xixiang, Zhen'an, and Zichang have recently studied various cold prevention measures in a timely manner, and while carrying out production, they have allocated a certain amount of manpower to carry out cold prevention preparation work.

In carrying out this work, all localities have implemented the principles of adapting to local conditions and making use of what is available. Zhen'an County, located in the Bashan mountainous area, has drawn on the cold prevention experience of local people in winter iron smelting in the past, building simple houses around the top of the indigenous blast furnace. The worker's sheds are built near the warm indigenous blast furnaces. In the loess plateau area of northern Shaanxi, where the weather is severely cold and coal resources are abundant, some are making full use of existing cave dwellings or digging new cave dwellings for workers to live in. Some are preparing to mine more coal to make fires next to the indigenous blast furnaces or in the mineral sheds. Some, in order to increase the furnace temperature, are actively studying how to change the cold air of the indigenous blast furnace to hot air.

### 研究防寒措施　加紧防寒准备  陕西保证高炉安全过冬

    研究防寒措施　加紧防寒准备
    陕西保证高炉安全过冬
    新华社西安3日电　冬季将到，陕西各地山区炼铁工地正在进行防寒准备，以保证天冷时照常炼铁。
    现在，巴山、秦岭和陕北山区，有的正在给土高炉穿衣裳——在沿炉顶四周搭上棚子，既有利于保持炉温，又使工人操作便利。有的在矿石、燃料存放处搭起草棚。采矿、炼铁工人们住宿的简易工棚里，有的已经铺上一层厚而松软的稻草或者其他禾秸。工人所需的冬衣、棉被，也由专人从各个人的家庭集中，开始源源送上山去。
    目前已是深秋季节，陕西省今年又比往年冷得较早，有些山区下雨时最低温度曾接近零度。在山区工作早晚都要穿棉衣。大批上山采矿、炼铁的人，都是在天气较暖、秋收以前去的，有的地方对土高炉和工人的防雨、防寒工作准备不够。因此，天气变化以后，有少数工人因冷生病；有的土高炉因为气温下降和供炼铁用的木炭着雨水分过多，正常出铁受到影响。针对上述情况，镇巴、西乡、镇安、子长等许多县，最近都及时研究了各种防寒措施，在进行生产的同时，抽出一定的人力进行防寒准备工作。
    各地在进行这个工作中，都贯彻了因地制宜和因陋就简的方针。处在巴山山区的镇安县，吸取当地群众过去冬季炼铁的防寒经验，在沿土高炉炉顶四周盖上简易的房子，炼铁工人的工棚又都搭在暖和的土高炉附近。在天气严寒、煤源较多的陕北黄土高原地区，有的尽量利用旧有窑洞或挖新的窑洞供工人住宿，有的准备多采一些煤在土高炉旁或矿石棚里生火；有的为了提高炉温，积极研究把土高炉的冷风改为送热风。
