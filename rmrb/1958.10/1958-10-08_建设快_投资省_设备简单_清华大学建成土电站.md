Fast Construction, Low Investment, Simple Equipment
Tsinghua University Builds Indigenous Power Station

(Our report) Tsinghua University faculty and students, working hard for two months using indigenous methods, have built a 2,000 kW rural experimental integrated utilization power station. This power station not only has a fast construction speed (ordinary power stations of the same type require fourteen months to build), but also saves a lot of investment. Generally, the investment for the same type of power station is 800 to 1,000 yuan per kW of generating capacity, but this power station only costs 300 yuan.

This power station is "indigenous" inside and out. Wooden sticks and bamboo poles replace power poles, earthenware pipes replace steel pipes in chemical and circulating water sections, red bricks replace refractory bricks, brick pillars replace steel frames, bamboo reinforcement replaces steel to build stairs and platforms, and wooden boards and water tanks are used to make oil switches. Construction also did not use cranes, but used indigenous methods to lift and install equipment. What is particularly prominent is that electrical equipment has also been "indigenized." They created indigenous fuses, indigenous lightning arresters, indigenous disconnecting switches, indigenous relays, indigenous insulators, indigenous capacitors, and indigenous lines and other power generation equipment. These devices are reliable in performance, can be made from local materials, and cost only one-twentieth to one-fiftieth of foreign equipment. These major innovations save more than 30% of steel.

This indigenous power station is located in an old Temple of Guan Yu, and boilers and condensers are exceptionally installed in the open air. They also simplified some equipment. This not only saves equipment and investment, but also simplifies the production process and operating procedures.

In addition to generating electricity, this power station can also produce many kinds of fuels, chemical raw materials, and building materials. According to calculations, this power station uses 18,000 tons of coal per year. In addition to generating electricity, it can produce 100 tons of gasoline, 185 tons of light diesel, 450 tons of heavy diesel, 74 tons of phenol, 92 tons of ammonia fertilizer, 13.5 million cubic meters of gas, 1,250 tons of clay cement, and 1,950 tons of slag cement. In this way, the cost of electricity generation is very low.

    建设快　投资省　设备简单
    清华大学建成土电站
    本报讯　清华大学师生奋战两个月，用土办法建成了一座二千瓩农村试验性的综合利用电站。这座电站不仅建设速度快（普通同类型电站需要十四个月建成），而且节省了大量投资，一般同类型电站每瓩发电容量需要投资八百到一千元，这个电站仅合三百元。
    这座电站里外都“土”。木棍、竹竿代替电杆，缸瓦管代替化工、循环水等部分的钢管，红砖代替耐火砖，砖柱代替钢架，竹筋代替钢材建成楼梯、平台，木板、水缸制成油开关；施工也没有用起重机，而是用土法起吊和安装设备。特别突出的是，电器设备也“土”化了。他们创造了土熔断器，土避雷器，土隔离开关，土继电器，土绝缘子，土电容器，土线路等发电设备。这些设备性能可靠，可以就地取材，成本仅及洋设备的二十分之一到五十分之一。这些重大的革新，节约钢材30％以上。
    这个土电站设在一个旧关帝庙里，锅炉、凝汽器破例地安装在露天地里。他们还简化了一些设备。这样不仅节省了设备和投资，还简化了生产过程和操作程序。
    这座电站除发电外，还可以生产出许多种燃料、化工原料和建筑材料。据计算，这个电站一年用一万八千吨煤，除发电外，可以生产出一百吨汽油，一百八十五吨轻柴油，四百五十吨重柴油，七十四吨酚，九十二吨氨肥，一千三百五十万立方公尺瓦斯，一千二百五十吨粘土水泥和一千九百五十吨矿渣水泥。这样一来，发电成本就十分便宜了。
