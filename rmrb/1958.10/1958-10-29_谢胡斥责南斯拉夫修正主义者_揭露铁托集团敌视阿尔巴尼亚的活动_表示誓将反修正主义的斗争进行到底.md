Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 27th: Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu recently condemned the U.S. imperialists' plot to launch a new war, particularly their provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area, at a mass rally. He said that all the conspiracies of the United States to ignite the flames of war have failed in the past and will fail in the future. The fate of the world today is no longer in the hands of the imperialists. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become a powerful and unbreakable force. If the imperialists want to launch a war against the socialist camp, the result will only bring complete destruction to the imperialists.

Shehu recently inspected the Tropoja region in northern Albania bordering Yugoslavia, attended a meeting of economic work activists in the region, and delivered a report on the domestic and international situation.

In his report, Shehu spoke of the imperialists' efforts to weaken the internal unity of the socialist camp, pointing out that the Yugoslav Tito group, wearing the cloak of socialism and communism, plays the role of saboteur for the imperialists, carrying out destructive activities against the international communist movement. The Yugoslav revisionists attempted to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, to undermine the prestige of the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, and issued calls against the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the government. Shehu said that the facts show that Albania is the best mirror of all the hostile activities carried out by the Yugoslav Trotskyite leaders, who oppose our country with conspiracies, sabotage, and intimidation.

Shehu said that the Albanian people will never forget the activities of the Yugoslav Trotskyites against our country. In particular, when we exposed to the world the Tito authorities' oppression and enslavement of our brothers living in Kosovo, Montenegro, and Macedonia within Yugoslavia, they frantically clamored through newspapers and radio stations. There are more than one million Albanians in Yugoslavia, thousands of whom have died under the machine guns of the Tito authorities, hundreds have been imprisoned in medieval prisons for refusing to give up their rights as a people of the Albanian nation, and thousands have been forcibly deprived of this right and driven to Turkey and remote areas of Yugoslavia. We loudly appeal for Tito's brutal oppression of our brothers and will make every effort until our brothers in Yugoslavia enjoy the basic rights of national minorities in capitalist countries. We demand, and will continue to demand, that they be given all rights.

Shehu then exposed Yugoslav espionage activities on the Albanian border, saying that the people of Tropoja all know that from 1948 to the present, the Yugoslav State Security Service has sent many spies and bandits to Tropoja. They are led by the enemy of the people, Tahir Hoxha, who used to be the Italian fascist gendarmerie captain in the Tropoja region and personally killed many guerrillas and patriots. These enemies of the people have hands stained with blood. They opposed our people under the Italian and German fascist occupiers, and today they are opposing our country from the side of the Yugoslav Tito group.

Shehu said that we vow to carry the struggle against revisionism through to the end. The Albanian people's struggle against revisionism is inseparable from the struggle against imperialism. They want to dig a grave for our People's Republic and our Party, but they themselves will fall into this grave.

    谢胡斥责南斯拉夫修正主义者
    揭露铁托集团敌视阿尔巴尼亚的活动
    表示誓将反修正主义的斗争进行到底
    新华社地拉那27日电  阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡最近在一个群众集会上谴责了美帝国主义者发动新战争的阴谋、特别是在台湾海峡地区对中国的挑衅。他说，美国企图燃起战火的一切阴谋过去已遭到了失败，今后还将会遭到失败。今天的世界命运已不再为帝国主义者所掌握，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已成为强大的和牢不可破的力量，帝国主义想发动反对社会主义阵营的战争，其结果只会给帝国主义带来彻底的毁灭。
    谢胡最近视察了阿尔巴尼亚北部同南斯拉夫接壤的特罗波雅地区，参加了这个地区的经济工作积极分子的集会，并在会上作了关于国内外形势的报告。
    谢胡在报告中谈到帝国主义竭力想削弱社会主义阵营内部团结时指出：南斯拉夫铁托集团披着社会主义和共产主义的外衣，充当给帝国主义者作破坏者的角色，在对国际共产主义运动进行破坏活动。南斯拉夫修正主义者企图破坏社会主义阵营的团结，企图破坏苏联、中国和所有社会主义国家的威信，发出了反对阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的叫嚣。谢胡说，事实表明，阿尔巴尼亚是南斯拉夫托洛茨基领导者们所干出的一切敌对活动的最好的镜子，这些破坏者以阴谋破坏活动和恫吓手段来反对我国。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚人民永远也忘记不了南斯拉夫托洛茨基分子反对我国的活动。特别是当我们向全世界揭露铁托当局压迫、奴役我们的生活在南斯拉夫境内科索沃、门的内哥罗和马其顿的兄弟时，他们就通过报刊和广播电台疯狂地叫嚣起来。南斯拉夫有一百多万阿尔巴尼亚族人，其中已有几千人死于铁托当局的机关枪下，有成百人由于不愿放弃作为阿尔巴尼亚民族的人民的权利，而被关进了中世纪的监狱，成千人则被强制丧失了这种权利和被赶往土耳其以及南斯拉夫边远的地区。我们为铁托残酷压迫我们的兄弟而高声呼吁，并将作出一切努力，直到我们在南斯拉夫的兄弟们享受到在资本主义国家少数民族的基本的权利。我们要求、并将继续要求给予他们一切的权利。
    谢胡接着揭露了南斯拉夫在阿尔巴尼亚边境的间谋活动，他说，特罗波雅人都知道，从1948年到现在，南斯拉夫国家保安处向特罗波雅派出了不少间谋和匪徒。他们由人民敌人塔希尔·霍查所领导，他过去曾是意大利法西斯在特罗波雅地区的宪兵队长，曾亲手杀过许多游击队员和爱国者。这些人民敌人的双手都是沾满着鲜血的，他们在意大利和德国法西斯占领者的手下反对过我们的人民，而今天，他们又在南斯拉夫铁托集团的那边来反对我们的国家。
    谢胡说，我们誓将把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底。阿尔巴尼亚人民反对修正主义的斗争和反对帝国主义的斗争是分不开的。他们想为我们的人民共和国和我们的党挖掘坟墓，但是，掉进这个坟墓的将是他们自己。
