Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 4th: Beirut News: After the US ambassador failed to forcefully insert Chamoun elements into the Lebanese Karami cabinet, the destructive activities of the Phalangist and National Socialist Party thugs who support Chamoun have become rampant throughout the country. In Beirut, Phalangists attacked the Lebanese Ministry of Defense yesterday. They also organized riot "demonstrations" in the streets, throwing stones at security forces. The rioters set fire to some shops and destroyed cars.

The Lebanese government dispatched troops, armored vehicles, and tanks to suppress the rioters. It is reported that the army opened fire, killing and wounding some of the rioters. Prime Minister Karami told reporters yesterday that the government had decided to continue to take strict measures to crack down on elements who dare to create disturbances.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 5th: According to reports in the "Oriental Daily" and "Star Daily" here today, Lebanese political leaders held a meeting at President Shehab's residence today to discuss the "principles of national reconciliation."

Phalangist leader Gemayel has met with Shehab twice in the past two days. Under the instigation of the United States and Chamoun, this fascist element is creating riots to undermine the Karami cabinet.

Beirut was relatively calm this morning. However, the obstacles in the northeastern districts have not yet been removed, and armed Phalangists and National Socialist Party members are still blocking vehicles from passing through there and the Beirut-Tripoli highway.
