    A Hundred Thousand Troops Open Mountains and Split Ridges: One Day's Production Equals One Year's
    Liucheng Daily Coal Output Reaches 86,000 Tons
    (Our newspaper, Nanning, 10th dispatch) The Liucheng County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region adopted the method of large-scale mass movements to run industry, and on September 30th released a "satellite" of indigenous coal mining with a daily output of 86,234 tons. Liucheng County's coal production on this day was equivalent to 96% of their annual coal mining task, and was 7,013 tons more than the average monthly output of Guangxi from January to August this year.
    The fact that Liucheng County launched a high-yield coal satellite proves that the most important reason for achieving this great achievement is the mobilization of the whole party and all the people with all their strength to carry out a large-scale mass movement to run industry. After the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee determined that Liucheng County's main task in the great iron and steel campaign was to produce "grain and grass" for iron and steel, the county party committee immediately made coal mining, coking, and the production of refractory bricks the central task overriding all others in the county, and immediately organized the whole party and all the people to carry out a great airing of views, big-character posters, great debates, and large-scale propaganda. The focus of the debate was whether industrial development could be carried out through mass movements. During the debate, the masses posted more than 65,000 big-character posters, refuting all the old arguments of those accustomed to doing things in the old way. After the promoters achieved a decisive victory ideologically, the masses throughout the county quickly organized themselves. In order to improve labor efficiency, the county party committee organized the labor force into a powerful field army and implemented the militarization of all the people. After the general mobilization of the whole party and the whole people, the Liucheng County Committee organized more than 100,000 people into a field army, with the county party secretary, ministers, and commune party secretaries serving as army, division, and regimental commanders and political commissars respectively, dividing the area into six war zones to contract for and command operations. In the production process, they also launched a large-scale competition movement, publishing combat newsletters, constantly commending the advanced, setting up banners, boosting morale, and comprehensively launching a movement to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the advanced. The enthusiasm of the masses was extremely high. In the first and second divisions alone, more than 6,000 advanced individuals were commended. The 72-year-old white-haired and silver-bearded old hero, Qin Zhifu, of the first regiment of the first division, charged alongside the young people. When the young people advised him to rest, he said, "I only realized at the age of seventy-two that this barren mountain has treasures. In order to see mechanization and electrification as soon as possible, I will risk my old life to compete with you young people."
    Because Liucheng County vigorously promoted mass movements, the difficulties in the work were easily solved. For example, the third division did not have hammers or steel drills, so they held a "Zhuge Liang meeting" at the construction site. At the meeting, the masses proposed that people should take turns to work day and night; use indigenous tools instead of foreign tools, using iron nails and rake teeth as steel drills, and using axes and pebbles instead of iron hammers; and immediately launched a tool collection campaign throughout the division. Due to insufficient technical strength, they adopted the method of experienced workers leading new workers, forming technical guidance groups to guide the work at various construction sites. In this way, people cut off the mountains in the middle to find coal routes. In one day, the hundred thousand field army peeled open six large mountains, split twenty-four large ridges, and removed 3.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone. The production efficiency also rapidly increased from one ton of coal mined by eight people per day in the past to one ton of coal mined by one person per day.
    Now, Liucheng County has decided to increase this year's coal production to one million tons, based on having already overfulfilled this year's national plan of producing 90,000 tons of coal.

    十万大军开山劈岭　一天产量抵得一年
    柳城日产煤八万六千吨
    本报南宁10日电　广西僮族自治区柳城县采取大规模群众运动的方法办工业，在9月30日放出土法采煤日产八万六千二百三十四吨的大“卫星”。柳城县这一天的煤产量，就相当于他们的全年采煤任务的96％，比广西今年1至8月份平均月产量还多七千零一十三吨。
    柳城县大放产煤卫星的事实证明：全党全民全力总动员，开展大规模的群众性的大办工业运动，是取得这个巨大成绩的重要原因。当自治区党委和柳州地委确定在大办钢铁当中柳城县的主要任务是生产钢铁的“粮草”以后，县委立即将挖煤、炼焦、生产耐火砖作为全县压倒一切的中心任务，并立即组织全党全民开展了大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论、大宣传。辩论的焦点是，办工业究竟能不能用群众运动的办法？辩论中，群众共贴出六万五千多张大字报。驳倒了习惯用老办法办事的人的一切陈旧论点，促进派在思想上取得决定性胜利后，全县群众迅速组织起来。县委为提高劳动效率，把劳动力组成强大野战军，实行全民军事化。经过全党全民总动员，柳城县委把十多万群众组成野战军，由县委书记、部长、公社党委书记分别担任军、师、团长和政治委员，划分六个战区，包干指挥作战。在生产过程中，还开展大竞赛运动，出版战斗小报，不断表扬先进，树立旗帜，鼓舞士气，全面开展学先进、赶先进、超先进的运动，群众情绪极为高涨。仅第一、第二两师受到表扬的先进人物就有六千多。第一师一团七十二岁白发银须的老英雄覃志富和青年一起打冲锋，青年人劝他休息，他说：“七十二岁才知道这个荒山有宝贝，为了早日看到机械化、电气化，我拼老命也和你们青年来比赛。”
    柳城县由于大搞群众运动，工作中的困难都迎刃而解。比如第三师没有铁锤、钢钻，他们就在工地召开“诸葛亮会”。会上群众提出人停工具不停，轮班日夜使用；以土工具代洋工具，用铁钉、耙齿当钢钻，用斧头、鹅卵石代铁锤；并且立即在全师范围内开展收工具运动。技术力量不足，他们就采取老手带新手的办法，把熟悉采煤技术的人组成技术指导小组，到各工地指导。就这样，人们把大山拦腰切断，寻找煤路，十万野战大军在一天中，就剥开六座大山，劈掉二十四个大岭，剥下土石方三百五十万立方。生产效率也由过去每天八人挖煤一吨迅速提高到每人一天挖煤一吨。
    现在，柳城县决定在已超额完成今年国家计划产煤九万吨的基础上，把今年的煤产量提高到一百万吨。
