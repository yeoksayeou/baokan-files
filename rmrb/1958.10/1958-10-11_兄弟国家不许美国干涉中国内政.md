Yugov Says: The Socialist Camp is China's Backing
Grotewohl Says: We Stand Completely with China
Hoxha Says: China Has the Power to Crush American Aggressive Conspiracies
Truong Chinh Says: America's "Ceasefire" Conspiracy Cannot Deceive People
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 9th: Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Yugov and German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke today at a mass rally at the Stalin Chemical Plant in Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria, condemning the US imperialists' shameless aggression against the Chinese people and expressing full support for the Chinese people's just struggle.

In his speech, Yugov pointed out that after suffering defeat in the Near East, the United States extended its aggressive war to the Taiwan Strait area, carrying out shameless provocations against China. However, the US imperialists encountered six hundred million Chinese people who firmly oppose aggression and have the powerful Soviet Union, the entire socialist camp, and all peace-loving humanity as their backing. Yugov emphasized that whether in the Near East or the Far East, imperialism will everywhere be decisively struck by the peace-loving and socialist countries.

In his speech, Grotewohl sternly condemned the US military provocations against China and said that the struggle of our Chinese friends is just, and we stand completely with them.

In his speech, Grotewohl heartily welcomed and fully supported the sincere desire of the Bulgarian people and government to make the Balkan region, once the powder keg of Europe, a zone of peace.

Yugov and Grotewohl spoke at a rally at the Stalin Chemical Plant welcoming the delegation from the East German party and government.

In their speeches, they also emphasized the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Yugov also said that the imperialists' echoers—modern revisionists—are attempting to undermine this unity in vain.

The East German party and government delegation, currently visiting Bulgaria, split into two groups today, led by Ulbricht and Grotewohl respectively, and left Sofia in the company of Zhivkov and Yugov to visit Varna and Dimitrovgrad. The people in various places held mass rallies to warmly welcome the delegation's visit.

Xinhua News Agency: Tirana, October 5th: Albanian Labor Party First Secretary Hoxha said on the 5th that US imperialism is carrying out military provocations against China, but today's China is already a powerful country, with a large and powerful army. At the same time, it is not isolated. The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is stronger than ever. In any case, every conspiracy of imperialism can be crushed.

Hoxha made these remarks to the local garrison during a visit to the Premeti region in southern Albania.

Hoxha told the soldiers that there is still a danger of war from imperialism, of course, this danger cannot scare us. But this situation must be faced squarely. He encouraged the soldiers to better master new weapons and study more of the theory of Marxism-Leninism.

On the same day, Hoxha also visited the agricultural cooperative in Premeti and talked with cooperative members about agricultural cultivation issues and the current international situation. Hoxha also condemned modern revisionism. He said that the revisionists in Belgrade have abandoned Marxism-Leninism and the path of establishing cooperatives in the countryside. Rich peasants and monopolists are again exploiting and plundering the farmers of Yugoslavia. The whole world has seen that the Yugoslav revisionists have become faithful servants of the imperialists, first and foremost the US imperialists.

Hoxha also visited two coal mining areas in southern Albania on the 4th. Hoxha told local teachers that the younger generation should be educated to love labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Truong Chinh, a member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese Labor Party, analyzed the current international situation here on the evening of the 8th to more than 10,000 cadres.

Speaking of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, Truong Chinh said that no one can be deceived by the American "ceasefire" conspiracy. He said that the actions of the US imperialists are indeed very brutal, but they have never been as isolated as they are now, and as politically bankrupt as they are now.

Truong Chinh welcomed the Chinese government's humanitarian action of ceasing shelling of Jinmen for seven days. He said that the Vietnamese people believe that the struggle of the Chinese people to liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan is purely China's internal affair, and no country has the right to interfere.

Truong Chinh said that the conclusions of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties over the past eleven months are completely correct.

Truong Chinh said that the facts of the past year have proven that socialism is increasingly overwhelming capitalism. The socialist camp is increasingly supported by the people of all countries in the world, especially the colonies and dependencies, and the newly independent countries, while the imperialist colonial system is rapidly disintegrating with the success of the Iraqi revolution, the establishment of the Republic of Algeria, and the birth of the Republic of Guinea.

Truong Chinh emphasized that the people no longer want to live as slaves, and the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union has given strong support to their struggles.

Speaking of the French "referendum," Truong Chinh said that de Gaulle's "constitution" was imposed on the French people, aiming to pave the way for a militarist dictatorship. He pointed out that the French people's struggle to safeguard the republican system will surely be victorious.

    兄弟国家不许美国干涉中国内政
    于哥夫说：社会主义阵营是中国的后盾
    格罗提渥说：我们完全同中国站在一起
    霍查说：中国有力量粉碎美国侵略阴谋
    长征说：美国的“停火”阴谋欺骗不了人
    新华社索非亚9日电　保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥今天在保加利亚的季米特洛夫格勒市斯大林化学工厂的群众大会上讲话，谴责了美帝国主义者对中国人民的无耻侵略，并且表示全力支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    于哥夫在讲话中指出，美国在近东遭到失败以后，又把它的侵略战火引向台湾海峡地区，对中国进行无耻挑衅。但是，美帝国主义者却在那里碰到了有着强大的苏联、整个社会主义阵营以及全体爱好和平的人类作为后盾的、坚决反对侵略的六亿中国人民。于哥夫强调指出，无论是在近东和远东，帝国主义到处都要受到珍视和平和社会主义的各国人民的决定性的打击。
    格罗提渥在讲话中严厉谴责美国对中国的军事挑衅以后说，我们的中国朋友们的斗争是正义的，我们完全同他们站在一起。
    格罗提渥在讲话中衷心表示欢迎和完全支持保加利亚人民和政府的要使曾是欧洲火药库的巴尔干地区成为和平区域的真诚愿望。
    于哥夫和格罗提渥是在斯大林化学工厂欢迎民主德国党政代表团的集会上讲话的。
    他们在讲话中还强调指出了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚如磐石的团结。于哥夫还说，帝国主义者的应声虫——现代修正主义分子企图破坏这一团结是枉费心机的。
    正在保加利亚访问的民主德国党政代表团今天分成两批，分别由乌布利希和格罗提渥率领，在日夫科夫和于哥夫的陪同下离开索非亚到瓦尔纳和季米特洛夫格勒访问。各地人民都举行了群众大会，热烈欢迎代表团的来访。
    据新华社讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记霍查5日说，美帝国主义正在对中国进行军事挑衅，但是，今天的中国已经是一个强大的国家，它拥有庞大的和强有力的军队。同时，它不是孤立的。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经比任何时候都强大了。在任何情况下，帝国主义的每一个阴谋都是可以粉碎的。
    霍查是在访问阿尔巴尼亚南部的普累美特地区时对当地的驻军说这番话的。
    霍查对战士们说，目前还存在来自帝国主义的战争危险，当然这种危险是吓不倒我们的。但是，应当正视这一情况。他勉励军人们要更好地掌握新武器和更多地学习马克思列宁主义的理论。
    同一天，霍查还访问了普累美特的农业合作社，并且同合作社社员们交谈了农业耕作问题和当前的国际形势。霍查还谴责了现代修正主义。他说，贝尔格莱德的修正主义者抛掉了马克思列宁主义和在农村建立合作社的道路。富农们、垄断者们又重新压榨和掠夺着南斯拉夫的农民。全世界都看到了南斯拉夫修正主义者已成了帝国主义者、首先是美帝国主义者的忠实仆从。
    霍查还在4日访问了阿尔巴尼亚南部的两个煤矿区。霍查对当地教师们说，应当教育年青一代热爱劳动。
    新华社河内10日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南劳动党政治局委员长征8日晚上在这里向一万多名干部分析了目前的国际局势。
    长征在谈到台湾海峡局势时说，美国的“停火”阴谋谁也欺骗不了。他说，美帝国主义者的行为确实非常残暴，但是它们从未像现在这样孤立，像现在这样在政治上陷于破产。
    长征表示欢迎中国政府停止七天炮击金门的人道主义的行动。他说，越南人民认为，中国人民解放沿海岛屿和台湾的斗争，纯粹是中国的内政，任何国家都无权干涉。
    长征说，过去十一个月以来的共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言的论断是完全正确的。
    长征说，过去一年的事实证明，社会主义越来越压倒资本主义。社会主义阵营日益得到全世界各国人民的支持，特别是殖民地和附庸国以及新近独立的国家的支持，而帝国主义殖民制度随着伊拉克革命成功、阿尔及利亚共和国成立、几内亚共和国诞生等事件正在迅速趋于分崩离析。
    长征强调指出，人民再也不愿过奴隶的生活了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对他们的斗争给予了有力支持。
    长征在谈到法国的“公民投票”时说，戴高乐“宪法”是强加在法国人民身上的，目的是为军国主义独裁政权铺平道路。他指出，法国人民维护共和制度的斗争必将取得胜利。
