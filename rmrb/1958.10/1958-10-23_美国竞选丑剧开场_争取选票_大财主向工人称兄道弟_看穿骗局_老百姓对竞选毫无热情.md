Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch, According to TASS, New York, 21st dispatch: The United States will hold elections on November 4th. The election includes one-third of the Senate seats, all House of Representatives seats, and governors and certain other officials of local government in thirty-four states. The election campaign has already begun enthusiastically in various places. As in the past, the entire election campaign this year is actually a farce orchestrated by American monopoly capital, with candidates from the two bourgeois parties, the Republican and Democratic parties, attacking each other. Even bourgeois figures cannot help but admit this point. John Knight, publisher of the Chicago "Daily News," recently wrote, when talking about the indifference shown by the American people toward the election campaign: "In recent years, our parties have not shown the people any real differences." He said that you can vote for Republicans or Democrats, but you will get "the same foreign policy and the same high taxes."

The election campaign currently underway in New York State particularly clearly demonstrates that American bourgeois democracy, based on the so-called "two-party system," is purely for show. The Democratic Party has once again nominated the financier Harriman as its candidate for governor of the state, and the Republican Party has nominated the even bigger financial tycoon Nelson Rockefeller. The journalist Alsop "discovered" that the only difference between these two is that "Harriman has already served as the governor of New York State, while Rockefeller is only just hoping to get the position." However, in order to win votes, these two financial oligarchs are competing to show their "love" for the workers. Rockefeller said at a mass meeting, "I have always been a friend of the workers." A few days later, Harriman went even further than Rockefeller, saying that he was not only a "friend of the workers," but that he himself was a "worker." He said, "I work sixteen hours a day and should be accepted as a union member." Harriman and Rockefeller often appeared in working-class residential areas to prove their "closeness" to the people, shaking hands with everyone they met. Once, in a coffee shop, a worker refused to shake hands with Rockefeller, saying, "A handshake is not something that can be deposited in the bank."

In the election, the power of money is enormous, as can be clearly seen from the attitude of the "New York Post" in this election. This newspaper is perhaps the only major American newspaper that consistently supports the Democratic Party. In 1954, this newspaper supported the Democratic candidate Harriman. It was to be expected that this newspaper would do the same in the current election campaign, but supporting candidate Harriman is equivalent to opposing the powerful Rockefeller family. The newspaper's publisher, Schiff, openly said that this year "choosing a candidate" is a difficult matter for her newspaper. Schiff's hesitation is obviously due to the "attraction" of Rockefeller's large amount of money. Another proof of Rockefeller's power of money is that, although he was formally nominated as the Republican candidate, he is running for election in the name of Rockefeller, because he believes that the name Rockefeller is more recognizable than the name of a Republican. In fact, since both the Republican and Democratic parties serve the Rockefeller family, it is perfectly "legitimate" for the Rockefeller family's representatives to place themselves above the two parties. As for why Rockefeller was nominated as the candidate for governor of New York State, most political commentators believe that being elected governor of New York State is only a stepping stone for Rockefeller to be nominated as a candidate for President of the United States in 1960.

Another lively scene in this farce is in California. The extremely reactionary Republican figure Nolan will participate in the gubernatorial election this time. Like Rockefeller, monopoly capital also hopes to have Nolan elected as the governor of a state as large as California, thus ensuring that he has the possibility of being nominated as a candidate for President of the United States in 1960. The election campaign in California has caused infighting within the Republican Party. Knight, the current Republican governor of California, refuses to withdraw from the election. However, some influential local capitalists demanded that Knight give this opportunity to Senator Nolan. These capitalists threatened that if Knight still wanted to nominate himself as a candidate for governor, they would not provide Knight with financial support. They suggested nominating Knight as a candidate for senator to compensate for Knight's "loss." So Knight surrendered. However, after the election campaign began, Knight, who is still the leader of the Republican Party organization in California, refused to publicly support candidate Nolan. In private conversations, Knight said that he would rather elect the Democratic candidate Brown than the Republican Nolan.

    美国竞选丑剧开场
    争取选票　大财主向工人称兄道弟
    看穿骗局　老百姓对竞选毫无热情
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社纽约21日讯：美国将在11月4日举行选举。选举三分之一的参议院议员，全体众议院议员以及三十四个州的州长和地方政权机构的某些其他官员。现在各地的竞选运动已经热烈展开。像过去一样，今年的整个竞选运动实际上是美国垄断资本所导演的两个资产阶级政党——共和党和民主党候选人之间互相攻讦的一场丑剧。这一点，就连资产阶级人士也不能不承认。芝加哥“每日新闻”发行人约翰·奈特最近在谈到美国老百姓对竞选运动所表现的冷漠态度时写道：“近几年来我们的政党没有向人民显示出真正的区别”。他说，你们可以投票选举共和党人，也可以选举民主党人，反正所得到的都是“同一种外交政策和同样高的捐税”。
    目前在纽约州进行的竞选运动中可以特别清楚地看到以所谓“两党制”为基础的美国资产阶级民主纯粹是装饰门面的。民主党再度提出这个州州长候选人是大金融家哈里曼，共和党提出的候选人是更大的金融头子纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。记者艾尔索普“发现”了这两人之间的唯一区别就是“哈里曼已经担任过纽约州州长，而洛克菲勒只不过是刚刚希望得到这个职位”。但是，为了骗取选票，这两个金融寡头竞相表现他们对工人的“热爱”。洛克菲勒在一次群众大会上说，“我一向是工人的朋友”。几天以后，哈里曼比洛克菲勒更进一步，他说，他不仅是“工人的朋友”，而且他本人就是“工人”。他说，“我一昼夜工作十六个小时，应该接受我为工会会员”。哈里曼和洛克菲勒为了证明他们同人民的“接近”，常常出现在工人住宅区，同所有和他们见面的人握手。有一次，在咖啡店里，一个工人拒绝同洛克菲勒握手，他说，“握手是不能够存入银行的东西。”
    在竞选中，金钱的力量是巨大的，从“纽约邮报”在这次选举中表示的态度可以明显地看出这一点。这家报纸也许是唯一的一贯支持民主党的美国大报。在1954年，这家报纸支持过民主党的候选人哈里曼。本来可以预料，这家报纸在目前的竞选运动中也会这样做的，但是，支持候选人哈里曼，就等于反对势力雄厚的洛克菲勒家族。这家报纸的发行人希夫公开说，今年
  “选择候选人”对她这家报纸来说是一件难事。希夫的犹豫不定显然是因为洛克菲勒的大量金钱的“吸引力”。洛克菲勒的金钱的力量又一证明是，虽然他正式被提名为共和党的候选人，但是他却以洛克菲勒的名义参加选举，因为他认为，洛克菲勒这个名字比共和党人的名字更响亮。事实上，共和党和民主党这两个党都是为洛克菲勒家族服务的，因此洛克菲勒家族的代表把自己置于这两个党之上，也是完全“合法”的。至于为什么提名洛克菲勒作为纽约州州长候选人这一点，大多数政治评论员都认为，当选为纽约州州长对洛克菲勒来说，只不过是为在1960年提名为美国总统候选人的一个台阶而已。
    这出丑剧的另一个热闹场面是在加利福尼亚州。共和党极反动的人物诺兰这次将参加州长竞选。同洛克菲勒一样，垄断资本也指望让诺兰当选为像加利福尼亚州这样大的州的州长，这样保证他有可能被提名为1960年的美国总统候选人。加利福尼亚州的竞选运动引起了共和党的内哄。目前任加利福尼亚州州长的共和党人奈特不肯退出竞选。但是，一些有影响的当地资本家要求奈特把这个机会让给参议员诺兰。这些资本家威胁说，如果奈特仍然要提他自己为州长候选人，那么，他们就不给予奈特以财政支持。他们建议，提奈特为参议员候选人来补偿奈特的“损失”。于是奈特就投降了。然而竞选运动开始以后，仍然担任共和党加利福尼亚党组织领袖的奈特拒绝公开支持候选人诺兰。奈特在私下谈话中说，他宁愿选举民主党候选人布朗，也不选举共和党人诺兰。
