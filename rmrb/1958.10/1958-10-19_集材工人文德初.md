    Timber Rafting Worker Wen Dechu
    Lin Guang

    Wen Dechu, a worker at the Zoushi Timber Yard in Hunan, has over ten years of experience. For many years, he has been engaged in the heavy labor of re-tying timber rafts.

    One day, he was re-tying a large raft and found it very tiring to lift hundreds of pounds of railway sleepers from the water onto the bottom raft. He suddenly thought, "If the bottom raft could be sunk a little lower, allowing the small rafts from upstream to be directly supported on the bottom raft for tying, wouldn't that improve work efficiency and eliminate the need for shoulder carrying?" This idea made him very happy. However, sinking a raft several feet long below the water surface was not an easy task. How much force would be needed to sink such a large raft? And what kind of tools could be used to push it down? A series of questions were difficult to solve.

    One day, he happened to see a car being repaired, with the driver using a jack to lift the car. He watched the car for a long time, and suddenly exclaimed, "Now I've figured it out!" He realized that "A small jack can lift such a large car just by twisting a screw. If several pulleys were installed on the riverbed under the raft, couldn't the raft be pulled down into the water?" He immediately ran home to make a plan, which was immediately strongly supported by the yard leaders, who also assigned six workers to assist him.

    How much buoyancy did the raft actually have in the water? Wen Dechu had not attended school and found it difficult to calculate. However, more than ten years of experience working on the water led him to devise a simple method for measuring buoyancy. He took a sixteen-centimeter diameter Chinese fir log and conducted three tests in the water, calculating the buoyancy of the Chinese fir and then extrapolating the buoyancy of pine and miscellaneous wood.

    With the buoyancy problem solved, he began to design the drawings. He had never drawn before, and worked hard for thirteen days and nights, drawing over a hundred drawings before finally producing a draft. The raft-sinking method he designed was finally successfully implemented.

    Using this new method to re-tie large rafts, each person can tie 480 cubic meters per day, increasing work efficiency by 19.2 times compared to manual shoulder carrying; saving 32.8 yuan in raft-tying costs. The entire year can save the country 32,136 labor days and save 65,878 yuan in funds. (Attached picture)

    集材工人文德初
    林光
    湖南陬市集材场工人文德初，已有十多年工龄，多少年来他就从事着改扎木排的繁重劳动。
    一天，他在改扎大排，要把几百斤重的枕木从水里抬到底排上，感到很吃累。忽然想起“如果把底排压沉得下一点，让上游送来的小排直接撑到底排上编扎起来，不是可以提高工效，消灭肩扛了吗？”这一想法使他非常高兴。可是要把数丈长的大木排压沉到水面以下，可不是一件容易的事。压沉这样大排需要多大力呢？又用什么样的工具才能压下去呢？一连串的问题都不好解决。
    有一天他偶然遇见一辆正在修理车轮的汽车，他看见汽车司机用千斤顶把汽车顶住，他在汽车旁看了很久，忽然情不自禁的叫起来“这下我可想出来了。”原来他想到：“小小的千斤顶只要扭扭螺丝就把那么大的汽车顶起来，如果在木排下面的河底上安置几个滑车，不也可以把木排拉到水下去吗？”他立刻跑回家作了个计划，当即得到场领导方面的大力支持，并派了六名工人协助他工作。
    木排在水里究竟有多大浮力？文德初没有读过书，很难计算出来。但是，十余年的水上工作经验，使他想出了一种简单测量浮力的方法。他拿一根十六公分中径的杉木放在水里，进行了三次试验，推算出杉木在水中的浮力，又推算出松杂木在水中的浮力。
    浮力问题解决了，便开始设计图样。他没有画过图，一连苦干了十三个昼夜，画过一百多张图纸，最后终于绘出了一张草图。他所设计的压排方法，终于胜利实现了。
    采用这种新方法改扎大排，每人每天可扎四百八十立方公尺，比过去人力肩运扎排提高工效十九点二倍；节省扎排费三十二点八元。全年可为国家节省劳力三万二千一百三十六个，节约资金六万五千八百七十八元。（附图片）
