Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 2nd - Beirut Dispatch: U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, has publicly demanded that the Karami government allow the henchmen of the Shamun traitorous clique, already spurned by the people, to participate in the cabinet. This blatant act of U.S. interference in Lebanese internal affairs has aroused great indignation among Lebanese politicians and the people.

According to reports, on September 30, the U.S. Ambassador, under the guise of "mediation," invited some Lebanese officials and Shamun group members, including Phalange leader Gemayel, to attend his "reception." At the meeting, he even demanded that the Karami government agree to the unreasonable demands of the Phalange Party, ceding four ministerial seats in the cabinet to the Shamun group and increasing the number of parliamentarians from sixty-six to eighty-eight. In this way, Shamun elements would vote in favor of the Karami cabinet in parliament.

The U.S. Ambassador also defended himself at a press conference held on the 1st, saying that the reason he convened the meeting was because "the situation in Lebanon is heading towards a dead end." He did not dare to explain the real reason for the recent resurgence of tension in Lebanon, which is due to the U.S. instigating the Shamun group and Phalange elements behind the scenes to carry out provocations and sabotage, attempting to obstruct the restoration of normal life in Lebanon and obstruct the Karami government from implementing policies that safeguard national interests.

McClintock admitted that his behavior was "unprecedented" for a diplomat, but he also threatened that if it was not resolved according to his method, Lebanon "might have a civil war."

Lebanese Prime Minister Karami refused to attend the U.S. Ambassador's "reception." The next day, he firmly stated that he rejected the U.S. Ambassador's "suggestions." He made it clear that under no circumstances would he be willing to reorganize the cabinet. Karami also held talks with Speaker of Parliament Oseiran and some parliamentarians that day. According to reports, Karami stated that if a majority opposing the government appeared in parliament, he would not hesitate to dissolve the parliament.

The Lebanese National Front issued a statement on the 1st, strongly condemning the U.S. Ambassador's interference in Lebanese internal affairs, and emphasized that the National Front does not welcome any "mediation plan" whose purpose is solely based on "obtaining positions."

Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yafi said, "I cannot understand how the U.S. Ambassador can hold such a reception and talk about purely Lebanese internal affairs. I believe that this interference by the U.S. Ambassador is a carefully planned action aimed at creating difficulties for the government in dealing with the current crisis." He pointed out that this interference reminded people of the foreign high commissioners who used to rule Lebanon but have now been driven away.

In the face of open U.S. interference and the Shamun group's sabotage, Lebanese patriotic forces are gathering to support the Karami government.

    美国大使公然胁迫卡拉米改组内阁
    黎巴嫩公众怒斥美国干涉内政
    据新华社大马士革2日电　贝鲁特消息：美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克公然要求卡拉米政府让已被人民唾弃的夏蒙卖国集团的党徒参加内阁，美国大使这种露骨干涉黎巴嫩内政的行径已经在黎巴嫩政治家和人民中间引起了极大的愤慨。
    据报道，美国大使在9月30日以“调停”为名，邀请一些黎巴嫩官员和夏蒙集团分子包括长枪党头子杰马耶勒等参加他的“招待会”。会上，他竟然要求卡拉米政府同意长枪党提出的无理要求，把内阁中的四个部长席位让给夏蒙集团，以及把议会人数从六十六名增加到八十八名。这样，夏蒙分子将在议会中投票赞成卡拉米内阁。
    美国大使还在1日举行的记者招待会上辩解说，他之所以召开这次会议，是因为“黎巴嫩局势正走向绝路”。他没有敢说明黎巴嫩最近局势的复趋紧张的真正原因，是由于美国在背后策动夏蒙集团和长枪党徒进行挑衅和捣乱，企图阻挠黎巴嫩正常生活的恢复和阻挠卡拉米政府执行维护民族利益的政策。
    麦克林托克承认他的行为作为一个外交官来说是“前所未有的”，但是他又威胁说，如果不按他的办法解决，黎巴嫩“可能发生内战”。
    黎巴嫩总理卡拉米拒绝出席美国大使的“招待会”。第二天，他又坚决表示拒绝美国大使的“建议”。他明白地说，在任何情况下，他都不愿改组内阁。卡拉米当天还同议长奥塞兰和一些议员进行会谈。据报道，卡拉米表示，如果在议会中出现反对政府的多数，他将毫不迟疑地解散议会。
    黎巴嫩民族阵线在1日发表声明，强烈谴责美国大使干涉黎巴嫩内政，并且强调指出，民族阵线不欢迎目的只在以“获得职位”为基础的任何“调解计划”。
    反对派领袖、前总理雅非说，“我不能够理解，美国大使怎么能够举行这种招待会和谈论纯粹是黎巴嫩内政的问题。我认为，美国大使的这种干涉是事先周密计划好了的行动，目的是要在政府面前制造处理目前危机的困难。”他指出，这种干涉使人们忆起了在过去统治黎巴嫩、可是现在已经被赶走的外国高级专员。
    在美国公开干涉和夏蒙集团捣乱的面前，黎巴嫩爱国力量正在集合起来支持卡拉米政府。
