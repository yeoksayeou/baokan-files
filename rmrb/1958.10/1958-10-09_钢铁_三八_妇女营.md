    Steel "March 8th" Women's Camp
    By Our Correspondents Shao Tingjun and Liu Zongtang
    "An Unprecedented Initiative"
    On the morning of August 1st, a rainstorm engulfed the Yangjia'ao Mountains in western Fushun County, Sichuan Province. The valley reverberated, and the forests howled. At that moment, a group of young women, carrying luggage, rations, hoes, and baskets, braving the wind and rain, climbed towards the mountaintop on the muddy and rugged sheep trails, singing battle songs. At the front of the line was a red flag with the words "An Unprecedented Initiative" written on it.
    These are the "Steel March 8th Women's Camp" we want to introduce to our readers. They are on a forced march to the front lines of steel production. This camp has more than sixty members, all women, with an average age of twenty-one. Before setting off, they made a solemn oath: to mine and smelt iron in the Yangjia'ao Mountains and make contributions to the motherland. They would never give up until they achieved their goal. For this, no storm could stop them.
    The Heartfelt Wish of All the People
    After the central government issued the call for the whole people to make steel, the women of Qifeng Township in Yongnian District, Fushun County, proposed to set up a "March 8th Furnace." On the afternoon of July 26th, the township women's federation made a mobilization report. As soon as the meeting ended, the office of the township women's federation was surrounded by women who wanted to sign up, packed inside and out, with more than a hundred people registering that day.
    In order to be cautious, the township stipulated that everyone must obtain the consent of their family. This stumped some people because they were worried that their families would not agree. Qiao Yonggui, a female member of the Communist Youth League, had a father whose thinking had always been backward; he was one of the few individual farmers in the township. Father and daughter had argued countless times over joining the cooperative. This time, Qiao Yonggui was prepared to have another big fight with her father. However, unexpectedly, the old father suddenly had a major change of heart. Not only did he agree to her going, but he also made a special trip to see her shortly after she went up the mountain, bringing some pickles; he also brought good news: the family had already joined the cooperative. Originally, in the past, the township had been promoting the future path of collectivization, using machines to farm.... He always thought, "It's all just empty talk. If everyone uses machines, where will all the steel come from?" Now, when he saw that many iron-smelting furnaces had been set up in his township, he believed that machine farming would come soon, and the idea of joining the cooperative was born.
    Only thirty-seven people were approved to go up the mountain in the first batch, with the conditions: aged between seventeen and twenty-five, physically strong, and with no family burdens. Many people could not go because they did not meet the requirements, but they still insisted on going. Auntie Li is already over fifty years old this year, and the township did not approve her. After the team went up the mountain, she secretly followed. Everyone knew that she was a progressive old lady with strong labor power. But the mountain was high and the road was slippery, which was indeed not suitable for her. After repeated persuasion, she finally agreed to go back. But she made a new request: she would go back and ask her daughter to come in her place tomorrow. The next day, she really brought her seventeen-year-old daughter.
    Everyone Surpasses the Men
    The Yangjia'ao Mountains are sparsely populated, with towering trees, and are often roamed by tigers and leopards. This group of women started from scratch here, mining and smelting iron, facing many unimaginable difficulties. It goes without saying that they encountered difficulties in their daily lives. For them, the greater difficulty lay in production. Mining requires the ability to identify ore; opening a mine requires drilling holes and blasting on cliffs; building a furnace requires manpower to push large rocks weighing hundreds of pounds onto the furnace. However, under the bold words "We are not afraid when we come, we will never go home until we have mined all the ore," they launched a struggle against various difficulties. If they didn't know how, they would learn from other male comrades and from the masters sent to teach them technology. If they didn't learn it once, they would learn it twice, three times, ten times, a hundred times, and finally overcome all the difficulties. Li Dingshu, who was only a semi-laborer at home, became an all-rounder in ore selection, mountain opening, drilling holes, blasting, batching, and smelting in less than a month after going up the mountain and was twice named a labor model. In addition to learning with everyone during the day, she often sneaked up the mountain alone late at night to practice. She was even learning technology in her dreams. The construction site is a battlefield and also a classroom, and the girls have become stronger. Someone said, "This is not just smelting iron, but also smelting people." We see the profound changes caused by Li Youqin. This girl used to live in a township and lived a pampered life. She had only been in the countryside for a few months. When she first came, everyone was afraid that she couldn't handle it, but now she can carry more than a hundred pounds of things and walk dozens of miles of mountain roads, and she works like she has a motor on her body. Everyone rated her as a labor model.
  Who Says Women Can't Smelt Iron?
    When they first came, the male comrades who were smelting iron on the nearby blast furnaces ridiculed them, saying: The girls all want to mine and smelt iron, it's just a pipe dream. Unexpectedly, after five days and nights of hard work, they built a three-cubic-meter earthen blast furnace. At this time, the male comrades who came to visit praised repeatedly, saying: It's really not easy.
    But the really not easy thing was still on the day of ignition and production.
    When the blast furnace was completed and put into production on August 18th, the women became even more nervous. They worked in shifts day and night, and people rested but tools did not. Each person usually only slept for four or five hours a day. However, no molten iron flowed out after ignition on the 23rd, and they failed. However, they checked and summarized the reasons for the failure, cleared the slag, loaded the materials, and ignited. In these three days, people's hearts were focused on "getting iron." Everyone was fighting regardless of their personal safety.
    After several days and nights of hard work, the moment that these sixty-odd hearts had been waiting for day and night arrived: "Iron is coming out! Iron is coming out!" Dozens of girls rushed from all directions and crowded in front of the blast furnace. Red-hot sparks kept splashing in all directions, but no one seemed to feel it. Jumping, bouncing, laughing, the slowly flowing bright red and glowing molten iron illuminated the faces of the girls.
    This was one of the three earliest iron-producing newly built earthen blast furnaces in the county. They used the first furnace of molten iron to cast iron blocks with the words "March 8th" on them, and that night, they sent four representatives carrying the iron blocks to the Fushun County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to report the good news. The County Party Committee awarded them a banner with the words "Steel Pioneers."
    Since the news of the first furnace of molten iron flowing out spread, women in all townships in the county launched a surge of "Learning from Qifeng, Catching up with Qifeng, Surpassing Qifeng." In a few days, women in thirty-three townships began to prepare for the "March 8th Blast Furnace," and nine factories had already started construction. (Attached picture)

    钢铁“三八”妇女营

    “史无前例的创举”
    8月1日上午，暴风雨掩没了四川省富顺县西部的杨家坳大山，山谷在震荡，树林在呼啸。就在这个时候，一队年青的姑娘，背着行李、干粮，扛着锄头、箩筐，迎着风雨，高唱着战歌，在泞滑而崎岖的羊肠小道上向山顶攀登。队伍的前面打着一面红旗，上面写着“史无前例的创举”几个大字。
    这就是我们要向读者介绍的“钢铁三八妇女营”，她们是在向钢铁生产前线上急行军。这个营有六十多人，全部是妇女，平均年龄是二十一岁。她们在出发之前，就立下了庄严的誓愿：要在杨家坳大山上开矿炼铁，为祖国立功。不达目的，决不罢休。为了这，狂风暴雨那能阻挡住她们。
    全民的心愿
    当中央发出全民办钢铁的号召后，富顺县永年区起凤乡的妇女就提出要求办一个“三八炉”。7月26日下午，乡妇联作了一次动员报告，刚一散会，乡妇联办公室就被要求报名的妇女们包围起来了，里里外外挤得水泄不通，当天就有一百多人报了名。
    乡里为了慎重起见，规定每个人必须征得家庭的同意。这下可把有些人难住了，因为她们耽心家里人不会同意。女共青团员乔永贵的父亲思想一向很落后，是全乡仅有的几个单干户中的一个，为了入社父女俩不知道争吵过多少次。这次乔永贵已作好准备再和父亲大闹一番。可是，想不到老父亲突然来了个大转变，不但同意她去，而且在她上山不久，又特地带些咸菜跑来看她；还带来一个好消息：家里已经入社了。原来，过去乡里宣传将来走合作化道路，要用机器种田……，他总是这样想：“尽是瞎吹，大家都用机器，那里来那么多钢铁？”现在，当他看到自己乡里已办起许多炼铁炉，才相信机器种田很快就要来了，入社思想也就产生了。
    第一批批准上山的只有三十七人，条件是：年龄在十七岁到二十五岁，体格健壮，无家庭牵累。有许多人因条件不够，去不成，但她们仍然闹着要去。李大娘今年已经五十多岁了，乡里没有批准她。在队伍上山以后，她偷偷跟了上来。大家都知道她是个思想进步的老大娘，劳动力也强。可是山高路滑，对她来说确实不适合。大家再三劝说，她总算答应回去。可是她提出新的要求说：我回去明天叫我的女儿代我来，第二天她果真把她的十七岁的女儿领了来。
    个个赛过男子汉
    杨家坳大山是一座人烟稀少、树木参天，常有虎豹出没的高山，这批妇女在这里白手起家，开矿炼铁，有许多难以想像的困难。生活上遇到困难不用细谈了，对她们说来，更大的困难还在生产上。采矿要能识别矿石；开矿要在悬岩陡壁上打炮眼、放大炮；建炉要把几百斤重的大石头靠人力推到炉上去。可是，她们在“来了就不怕，不把矿石挖尽决不回家”的壮言豪语下，和各种困难展开斗争。不会就向其他男同志学，向派来传授技术的师傅学。一次学不会，二次三次、十次百次地学，终于突破了重重难关。二十一岁的李定书在家里时还是个半劳动力，上山后不到一个月就成了个选矿、开山、打炮眼、放炮、配料、冶炼样样都行的多面手，两次被评为劳动模范。她除了白天和大家在一起学外，常常深夜还一个人摸到山上去练习。连做梦也在学技术。工地是战场，也是课堂，姑娘们锻炼得更坚强了。有人这样说：“这不只是在炼铁，而是在炼人。”从李幼琴身上，我们看到引起的深刻变化。这位姑娘过去长期住在乡镇上过着娇生惯养的生活，到农村才几个月，当她刚来时，大家都怕她吃不消，可是现在她能担一百多斤东西走上几十里山路，干起活来像身上带着马达一样，大家评她为劳动模范。
  谁说妇女不能炼铁？
    当她们刚来的时候，附近高炉上炼铁的男同志耻笑她们说：女娃儿都想开矿炼铁，真是白天做梦。不料，她们经过五昼夜的苦战就建成了一座三立方公尺容积的土高炉。这时，来参观的男同志连声称赞说：真不简单。
    但是，真正不简单的事情还在点火生产的日子里。
    当8月18日高炉建成投入生产时，妇女们的心情就更加紧张了。她们日夜轮流工作，人休息工具不休息。每人每天通常只睡四、五个小时。但是，23日点火后没有能够流出铁水，失败了。可是，她们检查和总结了失败的原因，清理炉碴，装料，点火。在这三天，人们的心都集中到“出铁”上来。个个都是奋不顾身的战斗着。
    经过几昼夜的苦战，这六十多颗心朝夕盼望的时刻来到了：“出铁了！出铁了！”几十个姑娘从四面赶来拥挤在高炉前，赤热的铁花不断向四方飞溅，但谁也像没有感觉到一样。跳呀，蹦呀，笑呀，徐徐流出的鲜红发光的铁水，映红了姑娘们的脸。
    这是全县新建土高炉三个最早出铁中的一个，她们用第一炉铁水，铸成了有三八字样的铁块，当夜就派了四个代表背着铁块送到中共富顺县委报喜，县委奖给她们一面写着“钢铁先锋”锦旗。
    自从第一炉铁水流出的消息传出后，全县各乡妇女风起云涌地掀起“学起凤、赶起凤、超起凤”的浪潮，在几天之中，有三十三个乡的妇女动手筹办“三八高炉”，有九个厂已经动工。（附图片）
