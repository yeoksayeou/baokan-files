Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 13th. Former Kuomintang uprising generals and former Kuomintang military and political personnel now in Guangzhou, after seeing Minister Peng Dehuai's order to suspend the shelling of Jinmen for another two weeks, expressed their views, hoping that their relatives and military and political personnel in Taiwan would recognize the greater national interest, make decisive decisions, take action, and jointly deal with U.S. imperialism.

　　Liang Shiji, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Counselor's Office and former Lieutenant General Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang Pacification Headquarters, who is participating in the leadership of steelmaking at the newly established Democratic Personages Hongzhuan Steel Plant, said today next to the coke oven: Minister Peng Dehuai's order to suspend the shelling of Jinmen for another two weeks is entirely in the spirit of national righteousness and unity against foreign enemies. It is once again a call to the military and political personnel in Taiwan. Anyone with a little patriotism should wake up and respond to the motherland's call. Taiwan is our country's sacred territory and will never allow U.S. imperialism to invade. I hope that the military and political personnel in Taiwan will, based on a patriotic standpoint, resolve to get rid of the enslavement of U.S. imperialism. Of the thirty-six stratagems, reconciliation is the best. Let them establish merit in the cause of resolving Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland.

　　Lu Man, former Lieutenant General Counselor of the Kuomintang Military Commission and current Counselor of the Guangdong Provincial Counselor's Office, said: When the Taiwan troops who are bitterly defending Jinmen and Ma are running out of ammunition and food, repeatedly stopping the shelling of Jinmen to allow them to receive adequate supplies shows that the people of the motherland have done their utmost and are magnanimous towards the military and political personnel in Taiwan. I have many old colleagues and old acquaintances in Taiwan, most of whom are patriotic. Today, as the motherland prospers and grows stronger, we are living a happy life in the motherland, while they are living a life of servitude in Taiwan under the humiliation of American aggressors. We hope that they can seize the opportunity to promote a peaceful resolution of Taiwan and jointly deal with our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

　　Lu Wenhao, former Colonel Counselor of the Kuomintang 62nd Army of the South Road Uprising Personnel and current Counselor of the Guangdong Provincial Counselor's Office, and others pointed out in their talks: Our motherland's people are fully capable of liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Ma, and repeatedly stopping the shelling of Jinmen is giving the military and political personnel in Taiwan a great opportunity to turn to the motherland. They hope that their old colleagues in Taiwan will wake up as soon as possible, and, in the patriotic spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, promote a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, and together with the people of the motherland, drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

    抓紧时机促成和平解决台湾问题
    新华社广州13日电　现在广州的前国民党起义将领和前国民党军政人员，今天看到了彭德怀部长发布金门炮击再停两星期的命令后，纷纷发表谈话，希望他们在台湾的亲友和军政人员认识民族大义，当机立断，行动起来，共同对付美帝国主义。
    正在新建立的民主人士红专钢铁厂参加领导炼钢工作的广东省参事室副主任、前国民党绥靖公署中将参谋长梁世骥，今天在炼焦炉旁发表谈话说：彭德怀部长命令再停止炮击金门两星期，完全是本着民族大义和一致对外的精神，再次向台湾军政人员发出呼唤，凡是稍有爱国心的人，都应该觉悟过来，响应祖国的号召。台湾是我国的神圣领土决不容许美帝国主义侵略。希望台湾军政人员本着爱国立场，决心摆脱美帝国主义的奴役。三十六着，和为上着，在解决台湾重归祖国怀抱的事业上建立功劳。
    前国民党军事委员会中将参议、现任广东省参事室参事陆满说：当苦守金、马的台湾军队弹尽粮绝的时候，一再停止对金门的炮击，让他们得到充分的补给，这说明祖国人民对台湾军政人员是仁至义尽的，气魄是伟大的。我有不少旧同事、旧相好在台湾，他们大部分是有爱国心的，在祖国繁荣富强的今天，我们在祖国过着幸福的生活，他们却在台湾在美国侵略者的凌辱下过着奴役的生活，我们希望他们能够抓紧时机，促成和平解决台湾，一致对付我们共同的敌人美帝国主义。
    前南路起义人员国民党六十二军上校参议、现任广东省参事室参事陆文浩等在谈话中指出：我们祖国人民完全有力量解放台、澎、金、马，一再停止炮击金门是给台湾军政人员投向祖国的一个大好机会。他们希望在台湾的旧同事早日觉悟过来，本着反帝反殖民主义的爱国精神，促成和平解决台湾问题，和祖国人民一起把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。
