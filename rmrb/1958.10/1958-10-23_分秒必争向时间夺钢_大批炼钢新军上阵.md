Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: Recently, a large number of new converters have been successively built on the steelmaking industrial front in our country and have joined the battle. This year, eighteen key iron and steel enterprises have newly built and expanded converter steelmaking workshops. According to statistics up to October 10, seventy new converters have been built, of which fifty have been put into production. In addition to the newly added medium and small-sized converters in various provinces and cities, the total number of large, medium, and small-sized converters built nationwide has reached over one thousand, with more than seven hundred already put into production; another batch is under construction.

The construction of these new converters is an important measure taken by various localities to achieve the great task of doubling steel production. The construction speed of this batch of converters is much faster than in previous years. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees, relevant departments in various localities have launched large-scale cooperation and support for local converter construction. The workers building the furnaces have also put forward slogans such as "Seizing every second" and "Grabbing steel from time," breaking through conventional construction practices, and thus creating many excellent achievements in rapid construction. The workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, for example, spent only fourteen days and nights to build a converter workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons of steel from a cornfield, becoming the first banner for rapid converter construction in the country. Since then, many new converters have been built rapidly in various places. In order to manufacture equipment in time and send it to the converter construction sites and workshops, mechanical factories across the country have placed the urgent production of metallurgical equipment at the top of their production plans, and many local non-mechanical industrial departments have also mobilized their machine repair workshops to rush the equipment for converters. Some enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, such as Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel, have also tried their best to tap the potential of enterprise machine repair facilities and rush-manufactured a batch of metallurgical equipment.

### 分秒必争向时间夺钢  大批炼钢新军上阵

    分秒必争向时间夺钢
    大批炼钢新军上阵
    据新华社22日讯　我国炼钢工业战线上最近有一大批新转炉陆续建成，参加了战斗行列。今年十八个重点钢铁企业都新建、扩建了转炉炼钢车间，到10月10日止的统计，已经建成七十座新转炉，其中五十座已经投入生产。加上各省市新增加的中、小型转炉，目前全国已经建成的大、中、小型转炉已达一千数百座，其中七百多座已经投入生产；还有一批正在建设。
    这些新转炉的建设，是各地为实现钢产量翻一番的伟大任务而采取的一项重要措施。这批转炉的建设速度比往年快得多。各地有关部门在党委的统一领导下，都对当地的转炉建设展开了大协作，大支援；建炉的职工们也纷纷提出“分秒必争”、“向时间夺钢”的口号，冲破施工常规，因而创造了许多快速施工的优异成绩。石景山钢铁公司的职工们就是这样，他们只用十四个昼夜的时间，便从苞谷地里建起了一座年产十万吨钢的转炉车间，成为全国转炉快速施工的第一面旗帜。以后，各地又出现了许多快速建成的新转炉。为了及时把设备制造出来送到转炉建设工地和车间，全国的机械工厂把赶制冶炼设备排在生产计划的第一位，许多地方的非机械工业部门也动员自己的机修车间为转炉赶作设备。冶金工业部所属的一些企业，如鞍钢、武钢、包钢和太原钢铁公司等，也多方设法，发挥企业机修设施的潜力，赶制了一批冶炼设备。
