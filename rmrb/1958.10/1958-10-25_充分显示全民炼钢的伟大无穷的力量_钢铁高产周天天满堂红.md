Xinhua News Agency, 24th: From the 15th to the 21st, the steel armies across the country launched a vigorous "High Production Week", pushing steel production to a new climax. The national steel production soared during the high production week. In one week, 437,000 tons of steel and 1,760,000 tons of iron were produced. The average daily output of steel was 62,500 tons, an increase of 85% compared to the previous fourteen-day average, and the average daily output of pig iron was 251,000 tons, an increase of 303%. Among them, the steel output on the 21st reached 107,424 tons, and on the 20th, the pig iron output reached 371,763 tons, creating the most glorious new production record since this year.

Continuous and large-scale high production is the distinct characteristic of this steel high production week. It once again demonstrates the great and unparalleled power of the whole Party and the entire people in vigorously developing the steel industry.

Due to the earnest implementation of the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach in various regions, indigenous steelmaking is unfolding across the country with the force of a thunderbolt and has begun to bear fruit. During the high production week, thousands of indigenous steel furnaces and furnace clusters were built in various provinces. The average daily steel output in Shanxi Province approached 10,000 tons. The three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Sichuan also reached more than 8,000 tons and 4,000 tons respectively. Shanxi and Shandong provinces once created new records of producing more than 20,000 tons of steel per day, exceeding the highest daily output level of Anshan Iron and Steel. During the high production week, the two provinces saw the emergence of fourteen counties and cities with a daily steel output of more than 1,000 tons. The steel output in Guizhou, Fujian, Guangxi, Gansu, Yunnan, Guangdong and other provinces also increased by seven to more than twenty times compared to the daily output in September.

Hundreds of thousands of steel workers in eighteen key enterprises strived to tap the potential of existing equipment during the high production week and put some newly built converters into production one after another. Therefore, the average daily steel output increased by 27.4% compared to the previous fourteen days. In recent days, the steel production in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Tangshan and other places has shown relatively significant progress.

In terms of pig iron, in addition to Liaoning Province, which has always been a "ten-thousand-ton province", the provinces and regions with an average daily output of more than 10,000 tons during the high production week included: Guangxi, Henan, Guizhou, Hubei, Shanxi, Hunan, etc. Yunnan Province also approached 10,000 tons.

During this high production week, not only did steel production take a new leap, but also, with steel as the key, it drove the overall leap forward in other work. When organizing the high production week for steel, many provinces also organized high production weeks for mining, coal mining, and transportation to adapt to this, and cooperated closely. It can be seen from some advanced and high-yield areas that in a region, in accordance with the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach, mining, coal mining, transportation and other work are combined with steel smelting to form a closely coordinated "chain", steel production will surely achieve a resounding victory, and satellites will shine brightly. For example, Xinhua County in Hunan Province, in areas rich in coal and iron resources within its territory, established twelve cooperation zones, established joint coal mining, mining, and smelting enterprises, and proposed "the whole people mine coal, the whole people mine, so that the furnace is full and well-fed", as a result, the county's pig iron production has consistently maintained a high level of production.

The steel armies in various regions were inspired and encouraged during the high production week, and expressed their confidence in consolidating the level of high-yield satellites, and to make persistent efforts to continue to advance to higher levels. The "skeptics" and "onlookers" once asserted that "launching satellites is only a matter of one or two days and cannot last", etc. In the face of the continuous and large-scale high production records created by this heroic steel army, they have completely lost.

### 充分显示全民炼钢的伟大无穷的力量  钢铁高产周天天满堂红

    充分显示全民炼钢的伟大无穷的力量
    钢铁高产周天天满堂红
    七天产钢四十三万七千吨，产铁一百七十六万吨
    平均日产量：钢六万二千多吨  铁二十五万多吨
    最高日产量：钢十万七千多吨  铁三十七万多吨
    新华社24日讯　各地钢铁大军从15日到21日，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的“高产周”，把钢铁生产推向了一个新的高潮。全国钢铁产量在高产周里比翼双飞，在一周中，共产钢四十三万七千吨，铁一百七十六万吨。钢的平均日产量六万二千五百吨，比以前的十四天平均增加了85％，生铁的平均日产量二十五万一千吨，增加了303％。其中，21日钢产量曾达到十万七千四百二十四吨，20日，生铁产量曾达到三十七万一千七百六十三吨，创造了今年以来最光辉的高产新纪录。
    连续的和大面积的高产，是这次钢铁高产周的鲜明特点。它再一次显示了全党全民大搞钢铁伟大无比的力量。
    由于各地认真贯彻执行了“小、土、群”的方针，土法炼钢正以雷霆万钧之势在各地展开并已开始开花结果。在高产周里，各省建起了成千上万的土炼钢炉和炉群；山西省每日平均产钢量接近一万吨；山东、河南和四川三个省也都达到八千多吨和四千多吨。山西和山东两省曾经分别创造了日产钢两万多吨的新纪录，超过了鞍钢的最高日产水平。两个省在高产周中，共涌现了十四个日产钢千吨以上的县、市。贵州、福建、广西、甘肃、云南、广东等省的钢产量，也比9月份日产量跃增了七倍到二十几倍。
    十八个重点企业的数十万钢铁职工，在高产周里努力挖掘原有设备的潜力，并把一部分新建转炉陆续投入了生产，因此，钢的平均日产量比以前的十四天增加了27.4％。这些天，进步比较显著的是北京、上海、太原、唐山等地的钢产。
    生铁方面，除辽宁省一直是“万吨省”以外，在高产周里日产量平均在万吨以上的有：广西、河南、贵州、湖北、山西、湖南等省、区，云南省也接近一万吨。
    在这次高产周里，不仅是钢铁生产有了一个新的飞跃，同时，以钢为纲，也带动了其他工作的全面跃进。许多省在组织钢铁高产周的时候，都组织了与此相适应的采矿、采煤和交通运输的高产周，协作配合。从一些先进、高产地区可以看出：在一个地区，依照“小、土、群”的路线，把采矿、采煤、交通运输等工作，跟钢铁冶炼结合起来，形成紧密协作、配合的“连环套”，钢铁生产就一定能旗开得胜，卫星高照。像湖南省新化县，在境内选择煤铁资源丰富的地区，成立了十二个协作区，建立采煤、挖矿、冶炼联合企业，提出“全民挖煤，全民开矿，让炉子吃饱吃好”，结果使全县生铁产量一直保持着高产水平。
    各地钢铁大军，在高产周中受到激励和鼓舞，满怀信心地表示要巩固高产卫星的水平，并且再接再厉，由此向更高的水平继续进发。“怀疑派”和“观潮派”曾经认定“放卫星不过是一、两天的事，不能持久”等等，在这次英雄钢铁大军创造连续的、大面积的高产纪录面前，他们彻底地输了。
