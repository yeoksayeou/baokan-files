    Open the Air-raid Shelter of Bourgeois Right
    Xu Hongzhong
    Intellectuals, along with the people of the whole country, have also risen to encircle and suppress the ideology of bourgeois right. But the minds of some so-called "senior intellectuals" are still like air-raid shelters, where the ideology of bourgeois right, this "bad thing that is good at sneaking into people's minds and causing trouble," hides. Moreover, it puts on various theoretical guises.
    Let's just grab a few examples to show the public:
    "People's intelligence and wisdom vary, and their work abilities differ in size, therefore, inequality between people is an objective reality that cannot be eliminated."
    The person who said this, of course, considers himself to be a senior intellectual with high intelligence and great work ability, and the so-called lower and smaller ones in their eyes are of course the general working people. As for who is actually higher and who is lower, who is bigger and who is smaller, it can be left aside for the moment (in comparison, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses); but this concept of high, low, big, and small itself is a manifestation of the concept of bourgeois right. Even if people's talents differ, why should people themselves be divided into high, low, big, and small? Logically speaking, after a person contributes all their strength to society, shouldn't they also receive everything they need for their life completely from society?
    The person who said this is obviously looking at the problem from the perspective of a class society, that is, from the perspective of the privileged class of the old society. There is indeed a temporary inequality between university professors and ordinary workers, which of course can also be called an "objective existence" because the difference between mental and physical labor does indeed still exist in the current society. The only question is, why can't it be "eliminated" even in a communist society?
    Communists recognize this objective existence, but also want to gradually eliminate it. The communist society we want to build is precisely a society that eliminates the differences between mental and physical labor, the differences between city and countryside, the differences between workers and peasants, and can completely achieve a society of complete equality where everyone "gives according to their ability and receives according to their needs," therefore we oppose hierarchical concepts and hierarchical systems. But those who advocate "cannot be eliminated" are trying to preserve this "objective existence" and deepen it as much as possible in order to achieve the purpose of preserving their own privileges. The so-called "cannot be eliminated" is just wishful thinking of these people. Now, the privileged status of these gentlemen has been fundamentally shaken, and workers and peasants are starting to gradually eliminate this existence. Therefore, what is more difficult to eliminate is what those gentlemen have stored in their air-raid shelters.
    The person who said this also distorted the root cause of the bourgeois right ideology of inequality, concealing its true nature as a product of class society, and putting on the guise of being a product of "different intelligence and work ability." This clearly shows that bourgeois intellectuals are stubbornly defending the absurd view that "all other occupations are inferior, only studying is noble" with an idealist viewpoint.
    "The grading system and piece-rate wage system can stimulate people's enthusiasm, and abolishing them is just accommodating the backward."
    On the surface, these words seem grand and justifiable. However, peeling off a layer reveals some rotten weeds inside. Recall the story of the grading and salary assessment the year before last: some university teachers, because they were not promoted, even suffered from insomnia for three days and nights, which was considered better; the next level down cried and made a big fuss. And some who were promoted, we didn't see any "enthusiasm" in them, but rather the active development of bourgeois ideology.
    The piece-rate wage system in universities made many teachers uneasy about teaching and wanted to write more external articles, give more lectures outside the school, and earn more "extra money," because fees and remuneration were paid according to the number of words and the amount of time. These people are like the Shylock criticized by Lenin in his book "State and Revolution," who said "I don't want to do half an hour more work than others, nor do I want to receive a little less pay than others."
    It seems that the grading system, piece-rate wage system, etc., only "stimulate" the Shylock-style "enthusiasm." And the broad masses of people who are regarded as lower and smaller, in the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, regardless of "grades" or "wages," in the construction of water conservancy and the steelmaking movement, not only supported the people of other townships, counties, and even provinces without pay, but also brought their own travel expenses and food. This enthusiasm, apart from the communist "foolishness," could it be stimulated by "piece-rate" and "promotion"!
    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have already formed an offensive against bourgeois right, and young students and the broad masses of intellectuals are also an army on one front of this force. And the last bastion of bourgeois right is probably still in the minds of those who consider themselves "higher" and "greater." In the situation of "besieging the city," as long as they are willing to open the air-raid shelter, that thing will no longer be difficult to eliminate.

    打开资产阶级法权的防空洞
    徐红中
    知识分子们也同全国人民一道起来围剿资产阶级法权思想了。但某些所谓“高级知识分子”的头脑，却还活像一个防空洞，资产阶级法权思想，这个“善于钻入人们头脑里兴妖作怪的坏东西”，就在那里躲藏着。而且，还穿起了种种理论的外衣。
    不妨随便抓出几个来示众：
    “人的聪明才智有高低，工作能力有大小，因此，人的不平等是客观存在，消灭不了的”。
    说这话的人，当然是自命为聪明才智高而又工作能力大的高级知识分子啦，而他们眼里的所谓低者、小者当然是一般的劳动人民。至于究竟谁高谁低，谁大谁小，可以存而不论（比起来是各有高低长短的）；但这种高、低、大、小的观念本身正好就是资产阶级法权观念的现形。即便人的才能有所差别，人本身为什么应该被区分为高、低、大、小呢？从道理上讲，人对社会贡献了自己全部力量以后，他不是也应当从社会完全得到他生活的需要吗？
    说这话的人，很明显是用阶级社会的眼光，也就是用旧社会的特权阶级的眼光来看待问题的。大学教授和普通工人之间，目前的确还暂时存在着不平等，当然这也可以被称作是“客观存在”，因为，当前社会的确还存在有脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。问题只在于，为什么到了共产主义社会，它还是“消灭不了”的呢？
    共产主义者，承认这种客观存在，而又要去逐步消灭这种存在。我们所要缔造的共产主义社会，正是这样一个消灭了脑力劳动同体力劳动差别、城市同乡村差别、工农之间的差别，而能完全作到“各尽所能各取所需”的人人完全平等的社会，因此我们反对等级观念和等级制度。而那些“不能消灭”论者却是要努力保存这种“客观存在”，并尽量加深它，以达保存自己特权的目的。所谓“不能消灭”云云，不过是这些人的一相情愿的主观臆想，如今，这些先生们的特权地位已经遭受了根本的动摇，而工人农民却正着手来逐步消灭这种存在了，因此，较难消灭的，倒是那些先生们防空洞里装的东西。
    说这话的人，还歪曲了不平等这个资产阶级法权思想产生的根源，掩住了它是阶级社会产儿的真面目，披上一件“聪明才智和工作能力不同”产物的外衣。这明显地表明：资产阶级知识分子们用唯心主义观点，来顽强地捍卫着“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的荒谬观点。
    “等级制、计件工资制可以刺激人们的积极性，取消了它，就是迁就了落后”。
    从表面上看来，这些话是冠冕堂皇的。可是，剥开一层皮来看，里面却是一些腐臭的杂草。回忆一下前年评级评薪时的故事吧：有些大学教师，因为没有提级，竟至失眠三个昼夜，这还算好些的；次一等的呢，就哭鼻子，大吵大闹。而有些提了级的，我们没有看到他什么“积极性”，倒是积极地发展了资产阶级思想。
    大学里的计件工资制呢，使许多教师不安心教学工作，而想多写些外稿，多讲些校外的课，多捞些“外快”，因为那是按字数、按时间发给稿费和酬劳的。这些人就像列宁在“国家与革命”一书中所批评过的“我不要比别人多做半小时工作，也不要比别人少得一点报酬”的夏洛克。
    看来，等级制、计件工资制等等，“刺激”的只是夏洛克式的“积极”性。而被他们看作低者、小者的广大群众呢，在工农业大跃进中，却不管什么“等级”、也不计较什么“工资”，在兴修水利和炼钢运动里头，不仅无报酬地支援外乡、外县、甚至外省的人民，而且还自带路费、自带干粮。这一股积极性除了共产主义的“傻劲”以外，岂是“计件”和“升级”所能刺激起来的！
    广大工农兵群众向资产阶级法权进攻的阵势，早已形成，青年学生和广大的知识分子，也是这支部队的一个方面军。而资产阶级法权观念的最后堡垒怕还是那些自视为“高者”、“大者”们的头脑，在“兵临城下”的情况下，只要肯把防空洞打开，那东西便再也不是难消灭的了。
