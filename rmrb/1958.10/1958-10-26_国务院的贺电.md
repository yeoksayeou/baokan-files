Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: The State Council's telegram of congratulations to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region People's Congress. The text is as follows:

    To the First People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region:

    Our country is now in a great historical period of an all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will further inspire the Hui people and all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to bravely leap forward towards the great goal of building socialism and communism. This is a major event for the Hui people and all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, and also a major event for all ethnic groups in the country. We extend our warm congratulations to you. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the autonomous region, the Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups in Ningxia will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, continuously consolidate and develop the unity and unification between all ethnic groups in accordance with the Party's general line for socialist construction, continue to exert revolutionary vigor, and jointly strive for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and scientific culture in the autonomous region, for fundamentally changing the economic and cultural outlook of the autonomous region in the shortest possible time, and for accelerating the completion of our country's socialist construction. We wish the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region even greater victories in socialist construction.

                              State Council of the People's Republic of China
                                          October 24, 1958
