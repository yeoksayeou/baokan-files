Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Radio telegraph speed experts from seven countries are poised to display their exceptional skills in Beijing during the 1958 International Radio Telegraph Rapid Transmission and Reception Friendship Competition. The opening ceremony will be held at 7:00 PM on November 1st at the Beijing Gymnasium. The radio delegations from Bulgaria, East Germany, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, the Soviet Union, and China will participate in this competition. Czechoslovakia will send an observer delegation. As of the 28th, the delegations from North Korea, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria have already arrived in Beijing, and the remaining delegations will arrive in the coming days.

The criteria for the competition are the speed and accuracy of sending and receiving telegrams. The competition includes the following events: receiving and sending five-character groups of meaningless numbers; receiving and sending five-character groups of meaningless code (meaningless code and numbers are those whose characters are linked together that cannot form words or sentences and do not express any meaning). The athletes participating in the competition are divided into hand-copy and machine-copy groups. Athletes in both groups must participate in all of the above events. Each national team consists of six athletes, three using hand-copy and three using typewriters. Each team must have at least one female athlete in each of the hand-copy and machine-copy groups. If there are no female athletes, only the scores of the two best-performing athletes will be counted.

The competition will be conducted in multiple sessions. There is no limit to the maximum speed of the competition, and athletes have the opportunity to go all out, unleash their technical capabilities without limitation, and create new records. The participants in this competition are the most outstanding telegraph operators from various countries, and they will demonstrate their abilities and create excellent results here.

The decision to hold this competition in China was made at the final organizational and judging meeting of the Second International Radio Telegraph Rapid Transmission and Reception Competition held in Czechoslovakia in 1956.
