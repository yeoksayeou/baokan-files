Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 24th: Hanoi newspapers today published the resolution made by the Vietnamese government's Ministerial Council at the end of September regarding agricultural production and early rice crop production in 1959.

The resolution stated that, in the period of developing and improving the national economy along the socialist direction, developing and transforming the agricultural economy according to the socialist path has a particularly important role for the socialist construction in the North and the struggle for the unification of the country. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize all the strength of the people, the Party, and the state to develop agricultural production on the basis of organizing farmers into mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and to promote agricultural production more rapidly.

The resolution pointed out that all the people must be determined to strive for a bumper harvest in winter and spring production. At present, we must immediately start winter plowing and production, and be determined to strive for a greater bumper harvest in next year's early crop than this year's late crop. The resolution stated that the government's Ministerial Council decided that all government ministries and state organs must study and adopt various measures to effectively serve agricultural production, serving the current late crop and next year's early crop.

The resolution stated that, in order to further serve agricultural production, corresponding improvements must be made in the organization of the people's democratic state. First of all, we must pay attention to the following types of issues: implementing hierarchical management, stipulating the powers and tasks of the provincial level; simplifying or abolishing complicated and unreasonable rules and regulations; streamlining administrative structures and transferring manpower to production departments; implementing the system of cadres participating in labor production; and stipulating disciplinary and responsibility systems.

The resolution emphasized that, in order to realize the centralized and unified leadership of the Party and the government, we must resolutely oppose deviations such as bureaucracy, departmentalism, localism, and lack of a sense of responsibility.

The resolution finally emphasized that the central authorities must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the national plan, and all localities must guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the plans formulated by their respective localities.
