Fangcheng County, Henan Province, has recently launched the "Twelve Families" movement in Chengguan Town. Do you know which twelve families? That is, everyone should aspire to be: writers, inventors, scientists, educators, medical scientists, singers, athletes, dramatists, painters, folk musicians, folk storytellers, and folk dancers.

For more than two months, 649 "Twelve Families" have closely integrated themselves with the Party's political struggles, production practices, and mass activities in each period, skillfully and cleverly using the forms they are familiar with and love to express the thoughts, emotions, and aspirations of the working people in production and construction, writing eleven scripts, and more than 3,100 poems, clappers, lyrics, etc. They can write a play in one morning, rehearse it in one afternoon, and meet the audience on stage, on the streets, and among the masses in the evening. The "Twelve Families" are not only a native-born and -bred literary and artistic army, but also a political propaganda and mobilization team.

Now, the "Twelve Families" are no longer a single flower; they have taken root, sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit in every corner of the county. The number of "Twelve Families" appearing throughout the county has reached 124,389. Cultural life has become a common occurrence in the lives of the working people. It truly is:

	Everyone writes,
	Everyone sings,
	Songs rise throughout the city,
	Thoughts are greatly liberated,
	Forms change daily,
	Content changes constantly.

Like the peasant poet Su Baozhen, who has just shed the cap of illiteracy, is an "all-rounder" in agricultural production, proficient in all kinds of farm work; in cultural education, he is both a poet and an educator. He can write five poems in one evening and use them as teaching materials to lecture to students in spare-time elementary schools. In addition, young painter Xiao Baolong can independently conceive and create paintings. The "Old Red" folk dance group composed of five old ladies over the age of fifty choreographs "Old Age Dance" and "Carrying Sedan Chair Dance," using actions to indicate the sedan chair when there is no sedan chair, and blowing with their mouths when there are no musical instruments. Seventy-two-year-old Dong Tuping can write, sing, and dance; sixty-three-year-old peasant poet Liu Junbang, in order to express his joy after wiping out illiteracy, thanking the Communist Party, and determined to use culture in production and construction, composed a new folk song:

	I have a granddaughter who is really capable,
	Every time she comes back from school,
	She holds a book and asks me to read.
	The illiteracy cap is now removed,
	It is still my granddaughter's merit.
	Now it is not difficult to calculate accounts,
	I can also read newspapers and magazines.
	Now agricultural tools need to be innovated,
	Strive for a great harvest every year;
	Today I want to show my skills,
	And do something in the Great Leap Forward.

The "Twelve Families" movement powerfully reflects the Great Leap Forward, promotes the Great Leap Forward, and marks the rapid growth and widespread blooming of the cultural and artistic level of the people. The communist style and spirit are so magnificent and great!

    方城人民“十二家”
    周穰民
    河南方城县城关镇，最近开展了“十二家”运动。你道是哪十二家？那就是人人要当：著作家、发明家、科学家、教育家、医学家、歌唱家、体育家、戏曲家、画家、民间音乐家、民间说唱家、民间舞蹈家。
    两个多月以来，六百四十九位“十二家”密切地通过党在每个时期的政治斗争、生产实践和群众活动，把劳动人民自己在生产建设中的思想、情感和愿望，熟练而巧妙地运用他们所熟悉所喜爱的形式，写出剧本十一本，诗歌、快板、唱词等三千一百多篇。他们能在一个上午编出剧来，又在一个下午排出来，晚上就能在舞台上、大街上和群众见面。“十二家”不止是一支土生土长的文艺大军，同时是一支政治宣传鼓动队。
    如今“十二家”已不是一枝独花，已经在全县各个角落生根、发芽、开花、结果了。全县出现的“十二家”已经有十二万四千三百八十九人。文化生活已成为劳动人民生活中的家常便饭，这真是：
    人人写，
    个个唱，
    歌声满城起，
    思想大解放，
    日日变形式，
    时时变内容。
    像刚刚摘掉文盲帽子的农民诗人苏保珍，在农业生产上是个“万能手”，庄稼活样样精通；在文化教育上，既是个诗歌家又是个教育家。他在一个晚上就能写出五篇诗歌，并且用来作为教材向业余小学学员讲课。此外如少年画家萧保龙，能独立构思成画。五个五十岁以上的老太婆组成的“老来红”民间舞蹈小组，编的“老年舞”、“抬轿舞”，没轿用动作示意，没乐器用嘴吹。七十二岁的老太婆董土苹，既会写，又会唱，还会舞；六十三岁的农民诗歌家柳俊邦，为了表现出自己在扫除文盲以后的愉快心情，感谢共产党，并决心把文化用在生产建设上，就编了一首新民歌：
    我有个孙女真能干，
    每逢上学回来后，
    拿着书本叫我念。
    文盲帽子今摘掉，
    还是孙女功劳换。
    如今算账不作难，
    报章杂志也能看。
    如今农具要革新，
    争取年年大丰收；
    今天我要显身手，
    大跃进中干一番。
    “十二家”运动有力地反映了大跃进，促进了大跃进，并标志了人民群众文化艺术水平的迅速成长和遍地开花。共产主义风格、气魄是如此雄壮伟大！
