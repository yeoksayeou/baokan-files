    I Hear the Rumble of Cannons
    Xu Chi
    At this moment the night is deep, I hear the rumble of cannons, coming from the coastal defense front lines, our army is heavily bombarding Jinmen.
    I hear the rumble of cannons, see the flashing fire, the people's armed forces are punishing the despicable Chiang Kai-shek gang.
    Given the opportunity to repent but not knowing how to repent, under hundreds of millions of shells, there is only one dead end.
    At this moment the night is deep, I hear the rumble of cannons, shooting towards the vast straits, guarding our territorial waters.
    The U.S. imperialists deliberately provoke, and repeated warnings are ignored, if you dare to continue escorting, you will definitely be wiped out.
    This flashing fire, this rumbling cannon fire, is teaching the American aggressors, don't even think about touching the Great Wall of Steel!

    我听见隆隆炮声
    徐迟此刻夜色深沉，我听见隆隆炮声，来自海防前线，我军正重轰金门。我听见隆隆炮声，看见闪闪的火光，人民武装正惩罚可耻的蒋匪帮。给了悔悟的机会而不知道悔悟，在亿万发炮弹下，只有一条死路。此刻夜色深沉，我听见隆隆炮声，射向浩渺的海峡，守卫我国的领海。美帝蓄意挑衅，一再警告不听，如敢继续护航，定将你消灭干净。这闪闪的火光，这隆隆的炮声，在教训美国侵略者，休想碰钢铁长城！
