Comrade Yang Yong, Commander of the esteemed Chinese People's Volunteers, Comrade Wang Ping, Political Commissar, and all comrades of the esteemed delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

Eight years ago, entrusted by the Chinese people, you marched valiantly and spiritedly across the Yalu River, and together with the Korean people, resisted the American aggressors and defended Korea and China. After three years of heroic fighting, you drove the American aggressors back to where they started the aggression. After the Korean armistice, you worked with the Korean people to make important contributions to consolidating the Korean armistice. Today, you have completed the glorious mission entrusted to you by the people of the motherland, and the entire army has returned victoriously. On behalf of the people of the whole country, I warmly welcome you! I celebrate your brilliant achievements! I celebrate your immortal feats for the security of the motherland and for peace in the Far East and the world!

The Chinese People's Volunteers are the pride of our motherland. You embodied the Chinese people's unparalleled heroic spirit of fearlessness, and the Chinese people's high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Without the victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean War front, the security of our great motherland would not be as guaranteed as it is today, and all our construction work would not be as smooth as it is today. Comrades, everything the motherland has today is inseparable from your victorious struggle on the Korean battlefield.

The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people in resisting American aggression made the whole world see that American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. Eight years ago, when the American aggressors crossed the 38th parallel and rushed straight to the Yalu River, how aggressive and arrogant they were! However, the long-tempered Chinese people, under the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, have long understood that "all reactionaries are paper tigers. It seems that the appearance of reactionaries is terrible, but in fact, they do not have much strength." Although our weapons were far inferior to the American army at that time, it is not weapons that determine the outcome of the war, but people. Justice is on our side, and we can completely defeat the American aggressors. Therefore, our army, which came from the people, was full of morale and high fighting spirit, and together with the Korean people, crushed the enemy's "offensives" one after another, and crushed the enemy's brutal "strangulation warfare" and germ warfare. In three years, we annihilated a total of 1.09 million enemies, including 390,000 American soldiers killed, wounded, and captured. The flames of war ignited by the American aggressors were finally extinguished on July 27, 1953. This fact made the American aggressors hate us to the bone. But the people of the whole world were cheered by it. The myth of the invincibility of American imperialism went bankrupt, and the American paper tiger was punctured. American imperialism can be defeated. This conclusion is of great significance to the people of the whole world. With this spiritual condition, the struggle of the people of the whole world against imperialism, mainly American imperialism, for aggression and oppression, will surely be rapidly developed.

The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people proved that only by resolutely resisting aggression can peace be maintained. After World War II, American imperialism was determined to dominate the world. American imperialism launched the Korean War not only to invade Korea and China. The Korean War was a major step in its preparation for a new world war on a world scale. The great victory of the Korean and Chinese people not only defended the security of Korea and China, but also disrupted the entire world war plan of American imperialism and made outstanding contributions to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world. This fact powerfully proves that the forces for defending peace in the contemporary world far outweigh the forces for imperialist war. It is possible to prevent imperialism from launching a new world war if all peace-loving countries and peoples unite and fight resolutely.

The Korean front is also the front of the entire socialist camp in the East resisting imperialist aggression. The victory of the Korean and Chinese people is also the victory of the entire socialist camp. This victory is inseparable from the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the mutual support of socialist countries. Everyone can see that without the strong unity and mutual support of the socialist family, there would be no brilliant victory of the Korean and Chinese people. Therefore, imperialists always try their best to undermine our unity so that they can carry out a policy of divide and conquer against our socialist countries. From this, it can be clearly seen that modern revisionists who tout "active neutrality," deny the existence of the socialist camp, and undermine the unity of socialist countries are actually nothing more than the special forces of American imperialism attempting to subvert socialist countries.

Korea and China are only separated by a river, and they are interdependent and share weal and woe. In the days of fighting side by side and resisting American aggression, the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries has been further developed. The fighting friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea under the banner of internationalism is the most noble and greatest friendship. In the past, we supported each other, helped each other, and learned from each other for the common cause of socialism and for the common struggle to defend peace; in the future, we will continue to support each other, help each other, and learn from each other. The Chinese people are very pleased to see that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people are building their country along the road of socialism with a high degree of revolutionary heroism. Since the armistice, the Korean people have made great progress in various aspects of economy and culture, and the face of the entire northern part of the republic has been renewed. We are deeply convinced that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the unification of the 3,000-mile rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be realized. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Korean people to realize this national aspiration, and warmly congratulate the prosperity, happiness, and strength of the Korean people.

The complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea is another major effort by us to promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the American army still refuses to withdraw from South Korea and illegally transports atomic weapons into South Korea, trying to permanently use South Korea as its colony and military base. This fully exposes that American imperialism is the chief culprit obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea and threatening peace in the Far East. Which peace-loving countries and people in the world do not recognize that the American army should withdraw from Korea and let the Korean people solve their own problems!

Comrades, while invading Korea, American imperialism occupied our territory of Taiwan. It attempts to follow the old path of Japanese imperialists' aggression against China, and attack the Chinese mainland from Korea and Taiwan. Now, the American troops in Korea have been driven back to the 38th parallel, but the American army still occupies Taiwan, as a springboard for its further attacks on our country, seriously threatening the security of our motherland. We are deeply convinced that the Chinese people, who drove the American aggressors from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel together with the Korean people, will certainly be able to drive the American aggressors out of the Taiwan region. It is unreasonable for the American army to occupy our territory of Taiwan. The American army must withdraw from Taiwan!

The United States attempts to use the trick of creating "two Chinas" to permanently occupy Taiwan and take the opportunity to attack our mainland. Recently, Dulles's talks with Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan most clearly exposed this attempt by the United States. There is only one China in the world, not "two Chinas." The United States' plan to create "two Chinas" is opposed by all Chinese. Comrade Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of our country, recently issued several proclamations, pointing out the bright road for the Taiwan compatriots. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will turn back from their wrong path and unite against foreign enemies. The affairs of the Chinese people can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves, and the Americans have no right to interfere at all. Any excuse for the American occupation of Taiwan is untenable. If the American aggressors insist on staying in Taiwan, then, in the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, in the face of the increasingly powerful Chinese people, it will inevitably suffer a more tragic and shameful failure than the Japanese aggressors!

Dear Volunteer Comrades! The progress of our great motherland in the past eight years has been extremely amazing. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country are going all out and launching a great leap forward in socialist construction. Eight years ago, China's steel production was only hundreds of thousands of tons, but this year it will exceed 10.07 million tons. Eight years ago, China's annual grain output was only more than 200 billion catties, but this year it will exceed 700 billion catties. China's science, culture, and art have also achieved rapid development, approaching or catching up with the world level in many aspects. The spiritual outlook of the people of the whole country is changing rapidly, and the communist style has become a new social atmosphere. The war provocations of American imperialism have only aroused the anger of the people of the whole country, and have only aroused the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the whole country to launch "satellites" on the industrial front, the agricultural front, and the cultural and scientific front. Now, the slogan of "everyone is a soldier" has begun to become a reality, and people's communes have developed throughout the country. China's socialist construction is moving towards a higher stage. The cause of the Chinese people to unify their motherland cannot be stopped by any force in the world. If eight years ago, when New China had just been founded, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army were able to drive the American aggressor troops from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel under the conditions that their equipment was far inferior to that of the American army; then, when our country has already achieved a great victory in the economic, political, and ideological socialist revolution, and completed the first five-year plan of our country's construction, our country has become even stronger, and in the international situation, the East wind has clearly prevailed over the West wind, if the imperialist aggressors dare to impose war on our heads, there will be no other result than to accelerate the demise of the imperialist system.

Dear Volunteer Comrades! The people of the whole country call you the most beloved people and take your spirit of perseverance and hard work as their example. Your heroic deeds on the Korean battlefield have fully demonstrated that China is a great and unyielding nation. We believe that after you return to the motherland, on all fronts of the motherland's great leap forward, you will surely be able to continue to show your heroic spirit and advance bravely together with the people of the motherland. Let the people of the whole country further unite more closely! We must continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Volunteers, overcome all difficulties and hardships, and fight heroically for the great cause of socialist construction in our country! We must continue to carry forward the soaring fighting spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, vigilantly pay attention to the movements of the imperialist aggressors, and be ready at all times to give the aggressors the heaviest blow in order to defend our beloved motherland! We must continue to hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of all peace-loving countries and peoples in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the whole world, oppose imperialist aggression, and defend world peace!

Let us shout:
Welcome the victorious return of the Chinese People's Volunteers!
Eternal glory to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!
Long live the fighting friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea!
Long live the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!
Long live our great motherland!
Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great Comrade Mao Zedong!

    志愿军是我们祖国的荣誉
    彭真在首都欢迎志愿军归国大会上的讲话亲爱的中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇同志、政治
    委员王平同志，亲爱的中国人民志愿军代
    表团全体同志们：
    八年以前，你们受了中国人民的委托，雄赳赳、气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民一道，抗击美国侵略者，保卫朝鲜，保卫中国。经过了三年的英勇战斗，你们把美国侵略者打退到它发动侵略时的地方，在朝鲜停战以后，你们又同朝鲜人民一起，对巩固朝鲜停战作出了重要的贡献。今天，你们完成了祖国人民咐托的光荣使命，全军胜利归来了，我以全国人民的名义，热烈地欢迎你们！庆祝你们的辉煌成就！庆祝你们为祖国的安全、为远东和世界和平立下的不朽功勋！
    中国人民志愿军是我们祖国的荣誉。你们体现了中国人民无比英勇的大无畏精神，体现了中国人民高度的爱国主义和国际主义。没有中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝战线上的胜利，我们伟大祖国的安全就不会得到像今天这样的保障，我们的一切建设工作也不会像今天这样的顺利。同志们，今天祖国的一切，是同你们在朝鲜战场上的斗争胜利分不开的。
    朝中人民抗击美国侵略者的伟大胜利，使全世界看穿了美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。八年以前，当美国侵略者越过三八线，直扑鸭绿江的时候，那是何等气势汹汹、不可一世！但是，久经锻炼的中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的教导下，早已懂得“一切反动派都是纸老虎，看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量”。虽然我们的武器当时远不如美国军队，但是，决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是人。正义是在我们这一边，我们完全可以战胜美国侵略者。因此，我们这支来自人民的军队，士气十分旺盛，斗志十分昂扬，和朝鲜人民一道，粉碎了敌人一次又一次的“攻势”，粉碎了敌人残暴的“绞杀战”和细菌战。三年中，我们共计歼灭敌人一百零九万，其中打死、打伤、俘虏美军共三十九万。美国侵略者燃起的战火，终于在1953年7月27日被扑灭了。这个事实，使美国侵略者恨之入骨。但是全世界人民却因此而欢欣鼓舞。美帝国主义者不可战胜的神话破产了，美国纸老虎被戳穿了。美国帝国主义是可以打败的。这个结论，对于全世界人民具有极大的意义。它从思想上武装了全世界人民。有了这个精神条件，全世界人民反对帝国主义，主要是美帝国主义侵略和压迫的斗争，就一定能够得到迅速的发展。
    朝中人民的伟大胜利，证明了只有坚决地反抗侵略，才能维护和平。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义就一心要独霸世界。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，决不是只限于侵略朝中两国。侵朝战争正是它准备世界规模的新战争的一个重大步骤。朝中人民的伟大胜利，不仅保卫了朝中两国的安全，而且打乱了美帝国主义的整个世界战争计划，对远东和世界和平事业作出了卓越的贡献。这个事实，有力地证明了：当代世界上保卫和平的力量，大大地超过了帝国主义战争力量，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民团结一致，坚决斗争，是可能制止帝国主义发动新的世界战争。
    朝鲜前线，同时也就是整个社会主义阵营在东方抗击帝国主义侵略的前线。朝中人民的胜利，也就是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。这个胜利，是同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强团结分不开的，是同社会主义各国的相互支援分不开的。谁都可以看到，没有社会主义大家庭的坚强团结和相互支援，就不可能有朝中人民的辉煌胜利。因此，帝国主义者总是千方百计地破坏我们的团结，好让它来对我们社会主义国家实行各个击破。从这里可以明显地看出，标榜“积极中立”、否认社会主义阵营存在、破坏社会主义各国团结的现代修正主义者，实际上不过是美帝国主义妄图颠复社会主义各国的别动队。
    朝鲜和中国只有一江之隔，唇齿相依，休戚与共。在并肩作战、抗击美国侵略的日子里，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊又有了新的发展。中朝两国人民在国际主义旗帜下用鲜血凝结成的战斗友谊，是最崇高、最伟大的友谊。为了社会主义的共同事业，为了保卫和平的共同斗争，过去，我们是互相支援，互相帮助，互相学习的；今后我们仍然要互相支援，互相帮助，互相学习。中国人民十分高兴地看到，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，朝鲜人民正以高度的革命英雄主义，沿着社会主义的道路，建设自己的国家。停战以来，朝鲜人民在经济和文化各方面，都有了巨大的发展，整个共和国北部的面貌已经为之一新。我们深信，在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，朝鲜三千里江山的统一，是一定要实现的。中国人民衷心地支持朝鲜人民为实现这个民族愿望而进行的正义斗争，并且热烈地祝贺朝鲜人民的繁荣、幸福和富强。
    中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，是我们促进朝鲜问题和平解决的又一次重大努力。但是，现在美国军队仍然拒绝从南朝鲜撤退，并且把原子武器非法运入南朝鲜，想把南朝鲜永远作为它的殖民地和军事基地。这就充分暴露了美帝国主义是阻挠朝鲜和平统一和威胁远东和平的罪魁祸首。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，有谁不承认：美国军队应当撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人自己解决自己的问题呢！
    同志们，美帝国主义在侵略朝鲜的同时，侵占了我国领土台湾。它企图沿着日本帝国主义者侵略中国的老路，从朝鲜和台湾两个方面钳击中国大陆。现在，在朝鲜的美军已经被打回到三八线了，但是美国军队还霸占着台湾，作为它进一步向我国进攻的跳板，严重地威胁着我们祖国的安全。我们深信，同朝鲜人民一道把美国侵略者从鸭绿江赶回三八线的中国人民，也一定能够使美国侵略者从台湾地区滚出去。美国军队霸占我国领土台湾是毫无道理的。美国军队必须撤出台湾！
    美国企图用制造“两个中国”的伎俩，永远霸占台湾，并且相机进攻我国大陆。最近杜勒斯到台湾同蒋介石会谈，最清楚地暴露了美国的这种企图。世界上只有一个中国，没有“两个中国”。美国制造“两个中国”的计划，是所有中国人都反对的。我国国防部长彭德怀同志最近所发表的几次文告，对台湾同胞指出了他们的光明道路，我们希望台湾当局能迷途知返，一致对外。中国人的事，只能由中国人自己解决，美国人丝毫无权过问。美国侵占台湾的任何借口，都是站不住脚的。如果美国侵略者硬要赖在台湾不走，那么，在东风压倒西风的国际情势下，在日益强大的中国人民面前，它就必将遭到比日本侵略者更加惨重、更加可耻的失败！
    亲爱的志愿军同志们！我们伟大的祖国，八年来的进步是极其惊人的。在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，全国人民正在鼓足干劲、掀起社会主义建设的大跃进高潮。八年前我国钢产量只有几十万吨，今年将超过一千零七十万吨。八年前我国粮食年产量只有二千多亿斤，今年将超过七千亿斤。我国的科学、文化、艺术事业也获得了飞快的发展，在许多方面接近或赶上了世界水平。全国人民的精神面貌正在迅速变化，共产主义的风格已经成了社会的新风气。美帝国主义的战争挑衅，不过是更加激起了全国人民的愤怒，不过是更加激起了全国人民的冲天干劲，在工业战线上，在农业战线上，在文化科学战线上，连放“卫星”。现在，全民皆兵的口号已经开始变成现实，人民公社已经在全国发展起来，我国的社会主义建设正在走向一个更高的阶段。中国人民统一自己祖国的事业，是世界上任何力量阻挡不了的。如果八年以前，新中国刚才成立的时候，在中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的装备远不如美国军队的条件下，还能够把美国侵略军从鸭绿江赶回三八线；那末，当着我国已经取得了经济上、政治上、思想上社会主义革命的伟大胜利，完成了我国建设的第一个五年计划，我国已经更加强大，而在国际形势上，东风又已经明显地压倒西风的现在，帝国主义侵略者如果胆敢把战争强加在我们的头上，除了加速帝国主义制度的灭亡以外，是不会有任何其他结果的。
    亲爱的志愿军同志们！全国人民把你们称作最可爱的人，把你们坚忍不拔、艰苦奋斗的精神作为他们的榜样。你们在朝鲜战场上的英雄业绩，已经充分表现了中国是一个伟大的、不可屈辱的民族。我们相信，你们回到祖国以后，在祖国大跃进的各个战线上，一定能够继续表现你们的英雄气概，同祖国人民一起奋勇前进。让我们全国人民更进一步地紧密团结起来！我们一定要继续发扬中国人民志愿军的光荣传统，克服一切困难艰苦，为我国社会主义建设的伟大事业英勇奋斗！我们一定要继续发扬中国人民志愿军那样的昂扬斗志，警惕地注视帝国主义侵略者的动向，时刻准备为保卫我们可爱的祖国，给予侵略者以最沉重的打击！我们一定要继续高举无产阶级国际主义旗帜，加强以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，反对帝国主义侵略，保卫世界和平！
    让我们高呼：
    欢迎中国人民志愿军胜利归国！
    在抗美援朝斗争中英勇牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东同志万岁！
