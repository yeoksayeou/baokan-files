Heroes Emerge from Steel Furnaces
    Our Correspondent in Nanjing

    In this world,
    What is more beautiful than the sparks of steel?
    In this world, what is more ardent than the hearts of steel warriors?
    Look!
    In the iron torrents rushing for thousands of miles,
    In the steel flowers bursting with golden light,
    Are soaked the blood, sweat, and wisdom of countless heroes.
    We can't find better words,
    To describe their unparalleled heroic deeds.
    Back then,
    Some people used "the most beloved people"
    To praise the Volunteers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea,
    Now,
    Why can't we say:
    These heroic steel warriors,
    Are just like the Volunteers of that time,
    They are
    The most beloved people in peaceful construction.

    Here are stories of a few of the thousands of heroes.
    "Let Me Do It to the End"
    "Number 3 furnace is hanging!" It was 11:00 PM when Xu Huixiang, the vice director of the Nanjing Standard Parts Factory who came from a worker's background, heard the news. He rushed to the furnace. Squad leader Wang Xigong also arrived. Together with Zhu Keli, the foreman of Number 3 furnace, they tried many methods, but the hanging problem remained unsolved.

    What to do? Xu Huixiang had already climbed onto the charging platform, trying to push the ore down. Braving the oncoming tongues of fire, he used a long iron rod to poke several holes. Unexpectedly, a thick, black plume of smoke and fire shot out of the holes, burning his hair and eyebrows. A piece of cloth tied to the iron rod also started to smolder. Xu Huixiang ignored all of this, simply turning his neck to the side and continuing to clear the blockage.

    The furnace was emptied, but some frozen iron slag chunks still clung to the furnace wall. There were also two holes next to the furnace door and air inlet. The iron slag had to be knocked off, and then coal paste had to be applied to block the holes before iron could continue to be tapped. At this time, although the blower was aimed directly at the furnace door, the temperature inside the furnace was still eight or nine hundred degrees. The red-hot furnace wall emitted a scorching red glow.

    Xu Huixiang thought: there are still half a day before the "satellite launching" target, if we do well, we can still strive to produce a furnace of iron; if we don't take a little risk, and wait for the furnace to cool down before repairing it, it will take seven or eight days. The sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member made him unhesitatingly pick up a cotton coat, ready to climb into the furnace to repair it.

    Just then, squad leader Wang Xigong suddenly stepped forward and pulled him back, saying, "Director, you can't go down. Let me go."

    Xu Huixiang refused to listen to the squad leader's advice. He put on a soaking wet cotton jacket and trousers, wrapped a wet towel around his head, put on canvas gloves, and put on a pair of goggles on his nose. Then, leaning back, he crawled into the red-hot furnace.

    As soon as he entered the furnace, a wave of scorching heat hit him, burning his inflamed right eye so much that tears streamed down. He had to open one eye and close the other to hammer away the iron slag. The small furnace did not allow him to move freely, so he had to put one hand under his armpit and lean his back against the dark red furnace wall to barely operate. Suddenly, the glass goggles shattered with a pop due to the high temperature. A piece of scrap iron splashed into his left eye, and a sharp pain made him dizzy. He gritted his teeth and continued to hammer the slag with his eyes closed.

    Three minutes later, Comrade Xu Huixiang crawled out of the furnace. The cotton coat was already scorched yellow. People rushed to take off his cotton coat, gloves, and towel. His face was flushed red by the fire, and the skin all over his body was also steamed red. Wang Xigong suggested taking turns going into the furnace to repair it. Xu Huixiang heard this and shouted, "Let me do it to the end. I know the situation inside the furnace." He quickly drank some water, re-wet the cotton coat, took his tools, and entered the furnace for the second time. He went in and out three times, finally patching up the furnace.

    Then, he threw himself into the battle of restarting the furnace, and insisted until 1:00 PM, seeing the first furnace of molten iron flow out with his own eyes.

    Determination Harder Than Steel
    This incident happened next to the blast furnace of the Nanjing Hongzhuan Foundry.

    More than 30 cadres from the Mechanical Department were opening the furnace in the rain. The molten iron flowed straight out of the furnace and into the iron ladle. Lao Rui, the mechanic in charge of the furnace, shouted, "The ladle is full! Block the tap hole!" Old Chen, the electrical technician, held the plugging rod and plugged the first mud ball. Director Wang then plugged the second, third, and fourth… But the molten iron continued to flow out. Seeing that the molten iron in the ladle was about to overflow, Lao Cui, the party branch secretary, quickly plugged another one, shouting loudly, "Lift the ladle! Carry it away!"

    Four young men came over and just lifted the hundreds of pounds of iron ladle when another stream of molten iron shot out of the furnace. The boiling molten iron landed on the rain-soaked ground, and a strong explosion erupted. Iron sparks flew in all directions, splashing on people's faces, hands, and bodies.

    Xiao Zhang, the technician carrying the ladle, loosened his grip slightly, and a stream of molten iron overflowed from the ladle, falling to the ground and turning into large, red water droplets that splashed up. Han Yuzhen, the communist party member and dispatcher carrying the ladle opposite him, had his glove set on fire by the splashing molten iron, and his fingers were burned. He forcefully threw off the burning glove. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his foot. Looking down, he saw a dozen iron droplets, the size of broad beans, rolling down his half-height rain boots, landing on his instep and heel. His socks were instantly burned through, and his rubber shoes were smoking. The 1300-degree molten iron stopped on his flesh, burrowing straight in. A sharp pain almost made him release the carrying pole of the ladle. At that moment, a thought quickly flashed through his mind: "If I let go of this ladle of iron and it falls to the ground, everyone around me, the party branch secretary, the director, the engineer, the technician, and other comrades, will be in danger, and this ladle of iron will be wasted." For the sake of steel, for the safety of the comrades on the construction site, he gritted his teeth and gripped the carrying pole even tighter. The burn was so painful that sweat streamed from his forehead to his neck, but he didn't cry out. He insisted on carefully pouring the molten iron into the sand mold, enduring the physical pain every second.

    When the doctor from the workshop health station used pliers to remove the iron blocks that had cooled in his blood one by one, yellow liquid flowed from the charred flesh in the pits. Large beads of sweat rolled down Han Yuzhen's pale face.

    But this young Communist Party member still didn't cry out in pain.

    Women Take the Field
    One morning, in the worker ranks processing ore at the Soap Factory, appeared an old lady with white hair, bound feet, and over sixty years old. She hurried along the way, asking everyone she met about Wang Hanye, the captain of the ore processing team.

    When the old lady saw Captain Wang, she said bluntly, "I want to join the ore processing team." Captain Wang frowned and said impolitely, "What's your name? At your age, you should take it easy!" The old lady was so angry that her heart was burning. She turned to Captain Wang and said, "My name is Shi Lishi. Don't look down on me. Let me show you." She squatted down and picked up a large iron hammer from the ground, smashing a large ore into pieces with a single blow. Captain Wang had no choice but to say helplessly: Approved her to join the Sanshan ore processing team.

    From that day on, Shi Lishi went to work early every morning and returned home late at night, rain or shine, never missing a day.

    In fact, the performance of Shi Lishi, who was seventy-two years old, in hammering ore was almost better than that of the average middle-aged woman. On the first day she went to the construction site to hammer ore, she only processed more than twenty pounds. That day, she was so anxious that she rushed to her neighbor's house after work to learn some tips. The next day, her output increased to more than one hundred pounds. After that, her daily output increased almost every day. On September 29, she hammered a full six hundred pounds.

    There were a total of 120 people in Shi Lishi's Sanshan ore processing team, most of whom were women. Almost all of them were heroes and skilled workers. In the past month, this ore crushing team has crushed several thousand tons of ore, feeding countless small blast furnaces. Some people can crush more than a ton a day. Readers, please imagine how much perseverance it takes to crush two thousand pounds of hard ore a day!

    Writing this, the images of these many steel heroes can't help but remind us of those admirable and lovable Volunteer heroes in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and those old men and old women who supported the front lines. Their resourcefulness, tenacity, and self-sacrificing noble qualities are now reappearing on the steel warriors.

    Who says heroes cannot emerge in peaceful construction? Where there is fiery struggle, there are heroic deeds.

    钢铁炉边出英雄
    本报驻南京记者
    世界上，
    有什么比钢铁的火花更美丽；
    世界上，有什么比钢铁战士们的心更炽烈。
    你看！
    那奔泄千里的铁流中，
    那金光迸发的钢花里，
    浸透着多少勇士们的血汗和智慧。
    我们实在找不到更好的字眼，
    来描写他们英勇无比的事迹。
    当年，
    有人用“最可爱的人”
    来歌颂抗美援朝中的志愿军，
    如今，
    我们何尝不能说：
    这些英武的钢铁战士们，
    也和当年的志愿军一样，
    他们是
    和平建设中最可爱的人。

    这里写的是千千万万个英雄中的几个。
    “让我干到底”
    “三号炉悬料了”，这时正是深夜十一点钟，南京标准件厂工人出身的副厂长徐会祥同志听到这个消息，立即赶到炉前，班长汪锡功也正巧赶到了。他们和三号炉长朱克立一起，想了许多办法，悬料问题始终没有解决。
    怎么办呢？这时，徐会祥已经登上料台，企图把矿石通下去，他冒着迎面飞窜的火舌，用长铁棍通了几个洞，不料，从洞里冲出一股浓黑黑的烟火，一下子把他的头发、眉毛都烧着了，绑在铁条上的一块布也冒出了一股烟。徐会祥根本没有理会这些，只是把脖子朝外一侧，继续进行通料。
    炉膛掏空了，而炉壁上还附着一些冻结的铁渣块子，炉门和风口旁边还有二个洞，一定要把铁渣打掉，再搪上煤素堵住洞口，才能继续出铁。这时，鼓风机虽然对准炉门直吹，炉内的温度仍有八、九百度。通红的炉壁发射着灼人的红光。
    徐会祥心里想：现在离放卫星还有半天，弄得好还能争取出一炉铁；如果不冒一点险，等炉子冷却了再修理，那要等到七、八天后。共产党员的责任感使他毫不犹豫地拿起一件棉衣，准备爬进炉子里去修理。
    正在这时，班长汪锡功突然一个箭步上前，用力把他拉住了说：“厂长，你不能下去，让我去。”
    徐会祥说什么也不听班长的劝阻，他穿上了一件湿透的棉袄和单裤，头上包扎一条湿毛巾，手上套了帆布手套鼻梁上架了一个风镜，就仰着身子钻进了炉壁通红的炉膛。
    一进炉，迎面扑来一股灼人的热气，烤得他那只正在发炎的右眼直淌泪水，只得睁一眼闭一眼地敲铁渣。小小的炉膛不容他施展，只好一只手放在腋下，后背靠在暗红色的炉壁上，才能勉强地操作。突然，玻璃做的风镜遇到高温，叭的一声炸破了，一块碎铁渣屑飞溅到左眼睛里，一阵剧烈的疼痛，使他头昏眼花。他咬紧牙关，闭着眼睛继续锤击矿渣。
    三分钟之后，徐会祥同志从炉子里钻出来了，棉袄已经烘得焦黄，人们忙着替他脱棉衣、手套，解毛巾，他的脸被火烘得通红，身上的皮肤也全部蒸红了。汪锡功提议轮流进炉抢修。徐会祥一听，嚷着：“让我干到底，我知道炉子里的情况”，他急忙喝了一点水，重新又打湿了棉衣，拿上工具，第二次又进炉膛去了。就这样三进三出，终于搪好了炉子。
    接着，他又投入了重新开炉炼铁的战斗中，一直坚持到下午一点钟，亲眼看到流出了第一炉铁水。
    决心比钢硬
    这件事发生在南京红专铸造厂的高炉旁边。
    机动科的三十多个干部在冒雨开炉，铁水从炉里直奔出来，流进铁水包。担任司炉的机械员老芮高喊着：“水包满啦，快堵炉眼。”电气技师老陈举着堵杆将第一个泥丸堵上去，王主任又接着堵上第二个，第三个，第四个……可是铁水还是不停的向外淌，眼看着铁水包里的铁水就要溢出来了，党支部书记老崔又迅速堵上去一个，一面大声?喝着：“抬包！快抬走！”
    四个小伙子走过来把几百斤重的铁水包刚一抬起，炉上重又窜出一股铁水，沸腾的铁水落在被雨水淋湿的地上，一阵强烈的爆炸声，铁星火花向四面飞溅开去，溅到人们的脸上、手上、身上。
    抬水包的技术员小张，手稍一松，一股铁水已从铁包里溢出，掉在地上变成大粒的红水珠飞溅起来。对面抬包的共产党员，调度员韩玉珍的手套被这股飞溅的铁水烧着了，手指被烧伤了，他用劲地将带着烟火的手套甩出去，突然，他觉得脚上一阵奇痛，低头一看，蚕豆般大小的十几个铁水珠，顺着半高统的雨鞋滚进去，落在脚面上、脚跟上，袜子顿时烧穿，胶鞋冒着青烟，一千三百多度的铁水，在肉上停下来，直往肉里钻，一阵剧烈的疼痛几乎使他松开了铁水包的抬杠。这时他脑子里很快闪过了一个念头：“假使这一包铁水被自己一松手倒在地上，那周围所有的人，党支书、主任、工程师、技师以及其他同志都会遭到危险，而这一包铁水也完了。“为了钢铁，为了工地上同志们的安全，他狠狠地咬住了牙，将抬包杠握得更紧，烫伤痛得他额上的汗直流到颈子里，他一声也没有叫喊，坚持着把铁水小心地倒进砂模里，他也一分一秒地忍受着肉体的疼痛。
    车间保健站医生替他用钳子将冷却在血中的铁块一个一个取出时，肉坑里的黄水从焦黑的肉里流了出来，韩玉珍苍白的脸上，滚下了黄豆大的汗珠。
    可是，这位年青的共产党员仍然没有喊一声痛。
    女将上阵
    一天早晨，在肥皂厂加工矿石的工人队伍里，出现一个白发苍苍，小脚玲玎，年过花甲的老太婆，她一路上急急忙忙，逢人便问矿石加工队的王汉叶队长。
    老太婆看到了王队长，直截了当地说：“我要加入矿石加工队”。王队长皱皱眉头，不客气地说：“你叫什么名字，这么大年纪还是息息吧！”老太婆听了气得心里直冒火，冲着王队长就说：“我叫石李氏，你别瞧不起俺，不信俺试给你看看”。她蹲下身子就从地上随手举起一把大铁锤，猛力一击，一块大矿石被她敲得粉碎。王队长只好无可奈何地说：批准她加入三山矿石加工队。
    从那天开始，石李氏每天清早上工，天黑回家，风雨无阻，从没有缺过一次勤。
    其实，七十二岁的石李氏敲矿石的成绩几乎已经赛过了一般中年妇女。到工地敲矿石的第一天，她只加工了二十多斤，那天，她心里急得要命，下工之后，赶到邻居家去学窍门。第二天的产量就提高到一百多斤。以后，她的日产量几乎是天天上升，日日增加，9月29日她整整敲了六百多斤。
    石李氏所在的三山矿石加工队一共有一百二十人，其中绝大部分是妇女。他们几乎个个都是英雄和能手。近一个月来，这个砸矿队已经敲了好几千吨矿石，喂饱了无数座小高炉，有些人每天能敲一吨以上。请读者们想像一下，一天敲二千斤坚硬的矿石，这该要多么坚韧的毅力呀！
                ×　×　×
    写到这里，这许多钢铁英雄的形象，使我们不禁联想到抗美援朝战争中那些可敬可爱的志愿军英雄们，想起了那些支援前线的老大爷、老大娘，他们那种机智、顽强、奋不顾身的崇高品质，现在重又在钢铁战士们的身上显现出来了。
    谁说和平建设中出不了英雄人物？那里有火热的斗争，那里就有英雄的事迹。
