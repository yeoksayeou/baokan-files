    There is Such a Soldier
    It was getting dark, and the Xuzhou Railway Station was particularly crowded. In the crowd, a child was crying loudly. A People's Liberation Army comrade not far from him immediately walked over, and after talking to him for a few words, he took the child away.
    I found what happened quite unusual, so I went to the scene to inquire, and this is what happened:
    The child was from Yaowan, Danji Township, Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province. He came to Xuzhou to take an entrance exam, but was not admitted, so he decided to go home. But when he got to the station, he found that he had no money on him, so he started crying. The soldier asked him about the reason, and without hesitation, he took the child to buy a ticket. After he bought the ticket and gave it to the child, he asked again: "How far is it from the station to your home?"
    "Eighteen li."
    "It will be dark when you get off the bus, what will you do?"
    "Stay at a hotel."
    "Doesn't staying at a hotel cost money?"
    "..." The child became embarrassed.
    The soldier took out some more money and handed it to him. The child was moved by the soldier's spirit and asked, "Comrade, which company are you from?" The soldier smiled and said, "Why ask which company? We are all brothers." Another soldier traveling with this soldier said, "He is from the Independent Second Company of Unit ○978, his name is Lü Xianpei."

    有这样一位军人
    天快黑了，徐州市车站特别拥挤。人群中，有一个孩子在高声大哭。离他不远的一位解放军同志，连忙走了过去，和他没谈几句话，就领着小孩走了。
    我看到发生的事情挺稀奇，便到出事地点去打听，原来是这么回事：
    小孩是江苏省铜山县单集乡姚湾人，来徐州考学，未被录取，便决定回家。可是到了车站，才发现自己身上没有了钱，就哭了起来。那位军人问清事由后，一点也没犹豫，便领着小孩去买车票。他买好票，交给那个小孩后，又问：你下车后，离家还有多远？
    “十八里。”
    “你下车黑天了，怎么办？”
    “住店。”
    “住店不花钱吗？”
    “……”小孩不好意思起来。
    那位军人又掏出了些钱递给他。那个孩子被军人的这种精神感动了，就问：“同志，你是那一连的？”军人笑了笑说：“问那一连干什么？咱们都是兄弟。”和这位军人同行的另一位军人却开了言：“他是○九七八部队独立二中队的，叫吕先沛。”
