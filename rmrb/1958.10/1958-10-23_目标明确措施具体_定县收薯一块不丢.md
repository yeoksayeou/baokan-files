Based on a report from the Hebei Daily: "Fight Hard for Thirty Days, Resolutely Win the Sweet Potato Battle!" This is the battle cry of the farmers of Ding County to defend the fruits of the Great Leap Forward, ensure a good harvest, and store sweet potatoes properly.

Ding County planted a total of 984,400 mu of sweet potatoes this year. Through a series of management measures, the expected yield per mu will reach 11,500 jin, with a total output of 11.316 billion jin, equivalent to more than 2.8 billion jin of grain, accounting for 90% of the county's total grain output. This represents a more than fourfold increase in yield per mu compared to 1957, and a fourteenfold increase in total output. Harvesting and storing such a large quantity of sweet potatoes, given the current labor shortage and tight schedule, is indeed a very arduous task. Based on the opinions of the masses, the county party committee decided to mobilize "the entire county's forces" to fight hard for thirty days and resolutely win the sweet potato battle. To ensure the planned and step-by-step successful completion of the task, a comprehensive and specific plan was made for harvesting sweet potatoes.

First, specific arrangements were made for the entire sweet potato crop, including how much to store as fresh potatoes and how much to slice and dry. Second, to ensure that all sweet potatoes were harvested in an orderly manner, it was decided to divide the work into three campaigns: The first campaign, from September 28th to October 8th, combined sowing wheat with digging up 300,000 mu of sweet potatoes (planting wheat after the sweet potato harvest, digging and deep plowing simultaneously), with all the dug sweet potatoes to be sliced and dried; the second campaign, from October 9th to 18th, involved digging up another 300,000 mu, and in addition to storing 1.6 billion jin of fresh potatoes, the rest were also sliced; the third campaign, from October 19th to 28th, aimed to complete the entire harvest, and properly slice, dry, and store all the dried sweet potato slices. Third, sufficient preparation of tools was essential. According to the task requirements, the entire county prepared 140,000 pieces of deep-digging three-pronged forks, four-pronged hoes, flat hoes, and deep-digging spades, modified more than 3,000 horse-drawn plow-style sweet potato digging machines, 26 tractor-drawn plow-style sweet potato digging machines, and 120,000 sickles. There were also more than 45,000 manual slicing machines capable of slicing 40,000 jin per day, more than 5,000 horse-drawn slicing machines capable of slicing 60,000 jin per day, and more than 400 mechanical power slicing machines capable of slicing 100,000 jin per day. In addition, more than 81,000 sweet potato cellars were dug. Fourth, to build the above plan on a solid and reliable foundation, specific arrangements were made for all labor in the county, ensuring concentrated efforts, coordinated cooperation, task allocation at all levels, and defined requirements for everyone. The entire county formed a 320,000-strong sweet potato harvesting army (with the remainder engaged in autumn harvest and wheat planting), including 100,000 able-bodied laborers. Working as units by brigade, efforts were made to properly allocate strong and weak laborers to ensure cooperation, with the labor force divided into several groups. The brigade then assigned specific tasks to each group, and the group assigned different tasks based on the strength of the laborers: two half-laborers, one cutting sweet potato vines, one picking up sweet potatoes, while the strong laborers dug up the potatoes, and at night, the three of them sliced them together. As a result of this allocation, every three people were only responsible for nine mu of sweet potatoes. To solve transportation difficulties, in addition to the necessary hauling back, measures were taken to dig cellars on the spot, store on the spot, slice on the spot, and store in warehouses on the spot.

    目标明确措施具体
    定县收薯一块不丢
    据河北日报消息　“苦战鏖战三十天，坚决打好甘薯仗”，这是定县农民为保卫大跃进的劳动结晶、保证收获好、贮藏好甘薯而提出的战斗口号。
    定县今年共种甘薯九十八万四千亩，经过一系列的管理措施，预计亩产可达到一万一千五百斤，总产一百一十三亿一千六百万斤，折粮二十八亿多斤，占全县粮食总产量的90％，较1957年亩产提高四倍多，总产量增加十四倍。要把这样多的甘薯收好贮藏好，在目前劳力紧张时间紧迫的情况下，确实是一个非常艰巨的任务。县委根据群众意见，决定发动“倾县之兵”，苦战鏖战三十天，坚决打好甘薯仗。为保证有计划、有步骤地胜利完成任务，对收获甘薯作了全面的具体的安排。
    他们首先把全部甘薯，储存多少鲜薯，切片晒干多少，作了具体安排。其次，为了使全部甘薯收获得很有秩序，决定分三个战役：第一个战役是从9月28日至10月8日，结合种麦刨薯三十万亩（薯茬种麦，作到边刨边深翻），所刨甘薯全部切片晒干；第二战役是从10月9日到18日，再刨三十万亩，除贮藏好十六亿斤鲜薯外，也都切了片；第三战役是从10月19日到28日，要全部收完，并作好切片晒干和薯干全部入仓的工作。第三，要作好工具的充分准备。根据任务要求，全县共准备了深刨三齿叉、四齿镐、平面镐和深掘锨十四万件，改制了马拉犁式刨薯机三千多台，拖拉机犁式刨薯机二十六台，镰刀十二万把。还有日切四万斤的人力切片机四万五千多部，日切六万多斤的马拉切片机五千多台，日切十万多斤的机械动力切片机四百多台。另外，还挖好甘薯窖八万一千多个。第四，为了把上述计划建筑在切实可靠的基础上，他们把全县所有劳力作了具体的安排，作到集中突击通力协作，层层分任务，人人定要求。全县组成三十二万人的收薯大军（其余的收秋和种麦），其中壮劳力十万人。以大队为单位作到壮弱适当搭配通力协作，把劳力划分成若干小组，大队再把具体任务分配到每个小组，小组再根据劳力强弱分配不同的作业，两个半劳力，一个割薯蔓，一个拾薯，壮劳力刨薯，晚上三人共同切片。这样分配结果，每三个人只合九亩地的甘薯。为解决运输上的困难，除必要拉回的以外，采取就地刨窖、就地贮藏、就地切片、就地入仓的办法。
