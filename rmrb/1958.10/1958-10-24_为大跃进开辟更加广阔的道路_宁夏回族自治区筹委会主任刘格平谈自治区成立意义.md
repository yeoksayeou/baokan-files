    Paving a Broader Path for the Great Leap Forward
    Liu Geping, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Discusses the Significance of the Region's Establishment

    (Our dispatch from Yinchuan, October 23rd) On the eve of the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Liu Geping, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, gave the following statement to our reporter regarding the significance of the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    He said that the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was established under the cordial care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the help of fraternal provinces and regions, especially the party and government leaders of Gansu, after more than a year of deliberation, consultation, and preparation. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is not only a great joyous event for the broad masses of Hui people and people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia, but also a joyous event for the people of the whole country. It marks another glorious victory for the Party's ethnic policy, and also marks the further development and consolidation of the unity of all ethnic groups in our great family of the motherland. It opens up a broader path for the Hui people to advance towards socialism and for the great leap forward in socialist construction in the Ningxia region.

    The Hui people are a relatively large minority ethnic group in the great family of the motherland. Due to the long-term oppression by the reactionary ruling class and various historical reasons, they are relatively scattered, with a total population of four million distributed throughout the country. In old China, they were long referred to as "poor Huis." In order to get rid of this backwardness and poverty, and to strive for national liberation, the Hui people also launched many struggles to resist the oppression of the reactionary ruling class, but all failed under the cruel suppression of the reactionary ruling class. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party did the Hui people achieve complete liberation. Since liberation, the Hui people, like all ethnic groups in the country, have realized their national equality rights and implemented ethnic regional autonomy under the brilliant light of the Party's ethnic policy. Three autonomous prefectures, Ningxia, Guyuan, and Wuzhong, were established in Gansu (the latter two were abolished due to the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region), and the Changji Autonomous Prefecture was established in Xinjiang. Nine Hui autonomous counties and one joint autonomous county with other ethnic groups have been established throughout the country, as well as hundreds of ethnic townships. The Hui people have also participated in land reform, agricultural cooperativization, the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and other political movements together with the people of the whole country, raising their socialist consciousness. Great development has also been achieved in economic and cultural undertakings, and the poverty and backwardness left over from history have gradually changed. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region not only provides conditions for the Hui people to develop into an advanced socialist nationality, but also will play a positive role in encouraging the Hui people throughout the country to actively participate in the country's socialist construction and jointly build a great motherland.

    The policy of ethnic regional autonomy is a fundamental policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in solving domestic ethnic issues using Marxism-Leninism. The realization of ethnic regional autonomy will further consolidate the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, bring into play their enthusiasm in socialist construction, enable all ethnic groups to rapidly develop into advanced socialist nationalities, and then all ethnic groups will jointly transition to communism. The correctness of this policy of the Party is once again demonstrated by the high enthusiasm and activeness shown by the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia in the process of establishing the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is occurring in the great era of socialist construction in our country, where "one day equals twenty years." Since this spring, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the people of all ethnic groups in the region have launched a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various constructions. The Ningxia Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's General Line, proposed "Riding the wind and waves, fighting hard for three years, and changing the face of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region." The people of the whole region, with soaring energy, have achieved great results on all fronts in order to realize this combat call. Agriculture has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with grain output increasing from 1.2 billion catties last year to 2.7 billion catties, making the average grain possession per person in the region 1,500 catties. The whole region has built 1.53 million mu of water conservancy in more than half a year, which is equal to the total of water conservancy achievements in the thousands of years before liberation. As of now, the people's commune system has been realized throughout the region. Under the principle of the whole people running industry, the number of large and small factories and mines in the region has developed to 9,500, and it is expected that the total industrial output value will increase by more than double compared with last year by the end of the year. At present, the people of the whole region have formed a 100,000-strong steel army and are engaged in intense battles to complete the production tasks of steel and copper this year. Cultural and educational undertakings are also developing at a high speed along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Three higher education institutions have been established in the region. Before liberation, there were only ten middle schools and five hundred primary schools. At present, the number of secondary schools has developed to 185 and primary schools to more than 3,000. 520,000 young and middle-aged illiterates in the region have enrolled in schools, of which 350,000 have already become literate. These vivid facts show that the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia are welcoming the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region with practical actions of hard work and solid work.

    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a promising region with abundant resources and excellent conditions for industrial and agricultural production. It is only because it has been subjected to the rule of the reactionary ruling class for a long time in history, especially the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government and Ma Hongkui in recent decades, that this region has been in a backward state. However, the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia are capable of changing this backward situation. The people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia have a glorious revolutionary tradition and have been deeply politically influenced by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for a long time. After liberation, the former Ningxia Province and Gansu Province carried out a series of work, and various construction undertakings have greatly developed. The Party's ethnic policy has been implemented, and the unity between ethnic groups and within the Hui ethnic group has been strengthened. Especially since last winter and this spring, the great victories achieved through the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle and the great leap forward in various constructions have laid a good foundation for the establishment of the autonomous region. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the autonomous region, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the help and support of the Han people and fraternal provinces and regions, the people of all ethnic groups in the region will be more united, further boost their energy, and contribute their strength to building a beautiful new Ningxia and jointly building our great socialist motherland.

    为大跃进开辟更加广阔的道路
    宁夏回族自治区筹委会主任刘格平谈自治区成立意义
    本报银川23日电　宁夏回族自治区筹委会主任刘格平在宁夏回族自治区成立前夕，就宁夏回族自治区的成立意义，对本报记者发表如下谈话。
    他说，宁夏回族自治区是在党中央、毛主席的亲切关怀下，在各兄弟省区特别是甘肃党政领导的帮助下，经过一年多的酝酿、协商和筹备而建立起来的。宁夏回族自治区的成立，不仅是广大回族人民和宁夏各族人民的大喜事，也是全国人民的喜事。他标志着党的民族政策的又一次光辉的胜利，也标志着我们祖国大家庭中各民族团结的进一步发展和巩固。它为回族人民向社会主义迈进和宁夏地区的社会主义建设的大跃进开辟了更加广阔的道路。
    回族，是祖国大家庭中人数较多的一个少数民族。由于政治上受到反动统治阶级的长期压迫和历史上的各种原因，使它居住比较分散，共有四百万的人口分布在全国各地。在旧中国，长时期以来都被人称为“穷回回”。回族人民为了摆脱这种落后和贫困，为了争取民族的解放。也曾掀起过多次的斗争，反抗反动统治阶级的压迫，但是都在反动统治阶级的残酷镇压下失败了。只有在中国共产党的领导下，回族才获得了彻底解放。解放以来，回族人民和全国各族人民一样在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，实现了民族平等权利，实行了民族区域自治。在甘肃建立了宁夏、固原、吴忠三个自治州（后两个由于宁夏回族自治区的建立而撤销），在新疆建立了昌吉自治州。在全国各地建立了回族自治县九个，和其他民族联合自治县一个，同时还建立了上百个的民族乡。回族人民还和全国人民一起参加了土地改革、农业合作化、整风反右派等各项政治运动，提高了社会主义觉悟。在经济和文化事业上也获得了很大的发展，历史上遗留下来的贫困、落后状态已经逐渐改变。宁夏回族自治区的建立，不仅为回族发展成为先进的社会主义民族提供了条件，在鼓舞全国各地回族人民积极参加祖国的各项社会主义建设，共同建设伟大的祖国也将起到积极的作用。
    民族区域自治政策，是党中央、毛主席运用马克思列宁主义解决国内民族问题的一项基本政策。民族区域自治的实现将更加巩固的团结各民族人民，发挥在社会主义建设中的积极性，使各民族能够迅速发展成为先进的社会主义民族，然后各民族共同向共产主义过渡。党的这一政策的正确性，从建立宁夏回族自治区过程中宁夏各族人民所表现出来的高度热情和积极性得到再一次的证明。
    宁夏回族自治区的建立正处在我国社会主义建设“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，今春以来，全区各族人民，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了工农业生产和各项建设的大跃进。中共宁夏工委根据党的总路线的精神，提出了“乘风破浪，苦战三年，改变宁夏回族自治区面貌”。全区人民即以冲天干劲，为实现这一战斗号召，在各个战线上取得了巨大成绩。农业上获得了亘古未有的空前大丰收，粮食产量由去年的十二亿斤增加到二十七亿斤，使全区每人平均有粮一千五百斤。全区半年多兴修水利一百五十三万亩，等于解放以前几千年水利实绩的总和。截至目前，全区已经实现人民公社化。在全民办工业的方针下全区大小厂矿已发展到九千五百个，预计到年底工业总产值将比去年增加一倍以上。目前全区人民已组成十万人的钢铁大军为完成今年钢铁铜的生产任务而进行着紧张的战斗。文化教育事业，也随着工农业生产的大跃进在高速度的发展。全区已办起三所高等学院。解放前只有中学十所、小学五百所。目前中等学校已发展到一百八十五所、小学三千多所。全区青壮年文盲已有五十二万人入学，其中三十五万人已经脱盲。这些生动的事实说明，宁夏各族人民正以苦干、实干的实际行动来迎接宁夏回族自治区的建立。
    宁夏回族自治区是一个大有希望的地区，这里资源丰富，工农业生产的条件都非常优异。只是由于历史上长期受到反动统治阶级的统治，特别是近几十年来受到国民党反动政府和马鸿逵的血腥统治，才使这个地区处于落后状态。但是勤劳勇敢的宁夏各族人民是能够改变这种落后面貌的，宁夏各族人民是有着光荣的革命传统，并长期受到陕甘宁边区的深刻政治影响。解放后，经前宁夏省和甘肃省进行了一系列工作，各项建设事业有了很大发展，贯彻执行了党的民族政策，加强了民族之间和回族内部的团结。特别是去冬今春以来，经过整风反右派斗争和各项建设大跃进取得的伟大胜利，为自治区的建立打下了良好的基础，我们坚信自治区成立后在党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，在汉族人民的各兄弟省区的帮助支援下，全区各族人民一定会更加团结，再鼓干劲，为建设美好的新宁夏、为共同建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而贡献出自己的力量。
