    Song of Eliminating Snails
    Fang Zichun
  Let's all eliminate snails together,
  And eradicate schistosomiasis from its root.
  Burn them with fire, kill them with medicine,
  No snail will escape its doom.
  Dig new ditches, fill old ditches,
  Straighten bends for smooth water flow.
  Bury the snails deep in pits,
  We vow not to rest until they're all gone.
  Dredge ditch grass and mud regularly,
  To collect fertilizer and ensure a bumper harvest.
  Reclaim lakeside grasslands together,
  A good strategy is to rush plant grains and oil crops.
  Convert snail-infested paddy fields to dry land,
  So people and livestock are safe and free from worry.
  Manage manure properly and regularly,
  So that germs have no freedom to reproduce.
  After three years of hard fighting, the snails will be gone,
  The land will yield more grain and cotton, and people will live longer.
  When schistosomiasis is completely eradicated,
  This great feat will be passed down through the ages.

    消灭钉螺歌
    方志纯
  消灭钉螺齐动手，
  血吸虫病绝根由。
  用火烧来用药杀，
  钉螺个个命难留。
  开挖新沟填旧沟，
  裁弯取直水畅流。
  钉螺打坑深埋葬，
  不灭干净誓不休。
  沟渠草泥常挖净，
  入窖积肥保丰收。
  滨湖草地齐开垦，
  抢种粮油是良谋。
  藏螺水田改旱种，
  人畜安全不担忧。
  粪便经常管理好，
  病虫繁殖无自由。
  苦战三年钉螺灭，
  地增粮棉人增寿。
  血吸虫病消灭尽，
  伟大壮举传千秋。
