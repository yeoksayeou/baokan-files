Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 14th. After reading Minister Peng Dehuai's order to the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front on the 13th, Hong Kong compatriots from all walks of life have expressed their views, hoping that the Taiwan authorities will take into account the overall interests of the nation and work with the people of the motherland to drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

Li Sheng, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, said: It is completely wrong for the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to distort our sincerity for peace talks as a "Communist trick." He said: The Taiwan Kuomintang authorities should recognize the overall situation, resolutely break away from American control, stand on the side of the people again, and work together to drive American imperialism out of Taiwan.

Feng Yong, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Planting Industry General Association, said: Our common enemy is American imperialism. Our country's territory must be liberated, and all American armed forces must get out of Taiwan. He said: Hong Kong and Kowloon farmers resolutely support Minister Peng Dehuai's order, and hope that the Taiwan authorities will wake up as soon as possible and make a decision that is beneficial to the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu.

Chen Pishi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, said: All patriotic compatriots hope that the Taiwan authorities will put national interests first, make a decisive decision, quickly break away from American control, and end the long-term civil war through peaceful negotiations. Su Chongming, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association, said: We Chinese people will never allow the United States to interfere in our affairs. The Kuomintang authorities should seize the opportunity to promote peace talks. Huang Zufen, Principal of Chung Wah Middle School, said: Minister Peng Dehuai's order shows that we have done our utmost to the Taiwan authorities. Wang Kuancheng, Vice President of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: Minister Peng Dehuai's order shows that our people have strong power and have absolute initiative. The Kuomintang leaders in Taiwan should recognize the situation and make a decision as soon as possible.

In the past week or more, many trade unions and social groups in Hong Kong have held gatherings, or issued statements and wrote letters to newspapers, resolutely supporting Minister Peng's "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan." The Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" have published a large number of talks by people from industrial, commercial, educational, publishing, film, art, sports, photography, music, and banking circles, as well as letters from many readers. They all unanimously condemned American imperialism for playing "ceasefire" conspiracies, and hoped that the Taiwan authorities would recognize the general trend, respond to the motherland's call, and peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue.

    新华社香港14日电　香港各界同胞在读了彭德怀部长13日给福建前线人民解放军的命令以后，纷纷发表谈话，希望台湾当局顾及民族大义，同祖国人民一起把美国侵略者从台湾赶出去。
    港九工会联合会理事长李生说：台湾蒋介石集团把我们和谈诚意曲解为“共产党的一条诡计”，是完全错误的。他说：台湾国民党当局应当认清大局，坚决摆脱美国的控制，重新站到人民这一边来，同心合力把美帝国主义赶出台湾。
    港九种植业总公会理事长冯镛说：我们的共同敌人是美帝国主义。我国的领土一定要解放，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾滚出去。他说：港九农民坚决拥护彭德怀部长的命令，希望台湾当局及早清醒，快些作出有利于台、澎、金、马同胞的决定。
    香港华人革新协会主席陈丕士说：所有爱国同胞都希望台湾当局以国家利益为重，当机立断，迅速摆脱美国的控制，通过和平谈判来结束长期的内战。香港华人文员协会主席苏重明说：我们中国人之间的问题决不容许美国插手。国民党当局应当把握时机，促成和谈。中华中学校长黄祖芬说：彭德怀部长的命令表明我们对台湾当局已仁至义尽。香港中华总商会副会长王宽诚说：彭德怀部长的命令说明我国人民拥有强大力量，掌握了绝对主动权。台湾国民党领袖应该认清局势，从速抉择。
    最近一个多星期以来，香港许多工会和社会团体都举行了集会，或发表谈话和写信给报社，坚决拥护彭部长的“告台湾同胞书”。香港“文汇报”和“大公报”连日大量发表了工商界、教育界、出版界、电影界、美术界、体育界、摄影界、音乐界和银行界人士的谈话，以及许多读者的来信。他们都一致斥责美帝国主义玩弄“停火”阴谋，希望台湾当局认清大势，响应祖国的号召，和平解决台湾问题。
