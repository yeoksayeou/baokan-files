    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 15th - Janos Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, delivered a speech today at a voters' meeting in Budapest attended by 100,000 people. He pointed out that the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands of China is China's internal affair. The American imperialists must not shamelessly interfere in China's internal affairs and the lives of the Chinese people.
    Kadar told the voters that we want peace, but we are not afraid of war. We believe in our own strength. The strength of the entire socialist camp is greater than the strength of imperialism. We must be vigilant because the imperialists are creating tension at all times.
    When Kadar talked about the construction achievements of socialist countries in his speech, he said that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in science, culture, and technology today. This is only possible under the socialist system. He said that China has put forward the slogan of catching up with Britain and is making great leaps forward in socialist construction. This fully demonstrates the superiority of socialism. He then said that our socialist construction should also be accelerated.
    Kadar also condemned the slander of socialist countries by Yugoslav revisionists and expressed support for the just struggles of people of all countries for freedom and independence.
    In his speech, Kadar also talked about the political, economic, and living conditions in Hungary.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 16th - Apostol, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and Chairman of the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions, said at a mass meeting in Bucharest on the evening of the 15th: "The Romanian Trade Union stands with the Chinese trade unions and working people who are fighting for the completion of the unification of their motherland. We demand that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and immediately withdraw its troops from the Taiwan region."
    This mass meeting was held to celebrate the opening of the World Week of Struggle and Solidarity of the working people and trade unions of the world for peace and disarmament. Thousands of working people and trade union activists participated in the meeting. Louis Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, was also invited to attend the meeting.
    Apostol said in his speech at the meeting: "The imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States continues to intensify the arming of its troops with atomic and hydrogen weapons. The American and British imperialists have ignited the flames of aggression in Lebanon and Jordan in the Arab world. At present, the United States is once again using force to blatantly undermine the norms of international law and provoking the People's Republic of China. The United States has brought new dangers to world peace."

    卡达尔在布达佩斯选民大会发表演说
    美国不得无耻干涉中国内政
    阿波斯托尔要美军立即撤出台湾地区
    新华社布达佩斯15日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔今天在布达佩斯有十万人参加的选民大会上发表演说，他指出，台湾和中国沿海岛屿的问题是中国的内政问题。美帝国主义者不得无耻地干涉中国的内政和中国人民的生活。
    卡达尔对选民说，我们要和平，但是也不怕战争。我们相信自己的力量。整个社会主义阵营的力量比帝国主义的力量强大。我们要提高警惕，因为帝国主义者无时无刻不在制造紧张局势。
    卡达尔在演说中谈到社会主义国家的建设成就时说，苏联今天在科学、文化、技术方面已经赶过了美国。这只有在社会主义制度之下才有可能实现。他说，中国提出了赶上英国的口号，并且在社会主义建设中正在大跃进。这充分显示了社会主义的优越性。他接着说，我们的社会主义建设也应当加快。
    卡达尔还谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义者对社会主义国家所进行的污蔑，并且表示支持各国人民争取自由和独立的正义斗争。
    卡达尔在演说中还谈到了匈牙利政治、经济、生活等方面的问题。
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电　罗马尼亚工人党中央政治局委员、罗马尼亚工会中央理事会主席阿波斯托尔15日晚间在布加勒斯特的一个群众大会上说：“罗马尼亚工会同为完成祖国统一而进行斗争的中国工会和劳动人民站在一起，我们要求美国停止干涉中国的内政，立即从台湾地区撤出它的军队。”
    这次群众大会是为了庆祝世界劳动人民和工会争取和平和裁军的斗争和团结周的开幕而举行的。参加大会的有成千的劳动人民和工会积极分子。世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬也应邀参加了大会。
    阿波斯托尔在大会讲话时说：“以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团继续加紧用原子武器和氢武器武装他们的军队。美、英帝国主义者在阿拉伯燃起了侵略黎巴嫩、约旦的战火。目前美国又用武力粗暴地破坏了国际法的准则，向中华人民共和国挑衅。美国给世界和平带来了新的危险”。
