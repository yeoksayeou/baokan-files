Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 2nd. Stockholm Message: The Secretariat of the World Peace Council yesterday issued an appeal on "Easing the Tension in the Far East and Eliminating the Danger of World War." The appeal pointed out that the root cause of the current tension in the Far East is the US provocation and aggression against China in the Taiwan Strait area. The appeal called on the national peace committees and all peace forces to unite with peace-loving people all over the world to launch a large-scale movement to stop the US aggression and provocative actions against China, and demand that the US armed forces immediately and completely withdraw from the Taiwan Strait. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

    “The United States' insistence on interfering in China's internal affairs and armed occupation of the Taiwan area is constantly exacerbating the tension in the Far East.

    “The US government is concentrating an unprecedented number of air and naval forces in this area to intensify and expand its military provocations and aggressive activities against China. This brings the imminent danger of a world war to mankind. The broadest world public opinion, including important statesmen and clear-sighted Americans in many countries, condemns this action as playing with fire. Many peace organizations around the world condemn the bellicose actions of the US government.

    “Since ancient times, Taiwan and other islands in this area have been Chinese territory. This is a long-recognized fact. The Cairo Declaration of 1943, the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, and the US government's own official statements have confirmed this. As world public opinion recognizes, this means that the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands, as well as how and when to liberate them, is entirely China's internal affair. The United States has no legal basis whatsoever to support the discredited Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people, and to obstruct the Chinese people from exercising sovereignty over their own territory.

    “The Secretariat of the World Peace Council recalls that the Council has repeatedly and resolutely demanded that the United States stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait.

    “We hope that the current Sino-US Warsaw talks can find a way to resolve the dangerous situation in this region.

    “World public opinion now recognizes that the key to achieving peace in this region is the withdrawal of US troops. The 'ceasefire' proposal currently put forward by the United States is being used to cover up this basic fact and deceive public opinion. There is no war between China and the United States at present. Any proposal that stipulates that US troops continue to occupy Chinese territory, support Chiang Kai-shek, and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating coastal islands and Taiwan, means intensifying provocations against China, aggravating the crisis, and increasing the danger of world war.

    “We ask the US government to consider world public opinion and change its dangerous policy.

    “We call on the national peace committees and all peace forces to unite with all people who are working for peace around the world to launch a large-scale movement to end US interference in China's internal affairs, stop US war provocations and aggressive actions, and demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of US troops from the Taiwan Strait. Only in this way can the tension in this region be eased and the danger of world war be eliminated.”

    世界和平理事会号召展开强大运动
    制止美国对中国侵略和挑衅  要求美军立即全部撤出台湾
    新华社布拉格2日电  斯德哥尔摩消息：世界和平理事会书记处昨天发表了关于“缓和远东紧张局势和消除世界大战危险”的呼吁书。呼吁书指出，目前远东紧张局势的根源是美国在台湾海峡地区对中国的挑衅和侵略。呼吁书号召各国和平委员会和一切和平力量同全世界爱好和平的人们联合起来，展开一个声势浩大的运动，制止美国对中国的侵略和挑衅行动，要求美国武装部队立即全部撤出台湾海峡。呼吁书全文如下：
    “美国坚持干涉中国内政并武装占领台湾地区正在使远东紧张局势不断恶化。
    “美国政府正在这个地区集结空前多的空军和海军部队，来加剧和扩大对中国的军事挑衅和侵略活动。这给人类带来了世界大战灾难迫在眉睫的危险。最广泛的世界舆论，包括许多国家的重要政治家和目光清晰的美国人在内，都谴责这种行动是玩火。全世界许多和平组织都谴责美国政府的这种好战行动。
    “自古以来，台湾和这个地区的其他岛屿一直是中国的领土，这是一个早就公认的事实，1943年的开罗宣言，1945年的波茨坦公告和美国政府自己的官方声明都证实了这一点。正如世界舆论所认识的那样，这意味着，解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖和其他沿海岛屿，以及怎样解放和在什么时候解放，完全是中国的内政。美国丝毫没有法律根据可以支持早就被中国人民所唾弃的名誉扫地的蒋介石集团和阻挠中国人民对他们自己的领土行使主权。
    “世界和平理事会书记处追述，理事会曾经多次坚决要求美国停止干涉中国内政，并且从台湾海峡地区撤退它的武装部队。
    “我们希望目前的中美华沙会谈能找出解决这个地区的危险局势的办法。
    “世界舆论目前认识到，在这个地区实现和平的关键是美国部队的撤退。美国目前所提出的‘停火’方案正在被用来掩饰这个基本事实和欺骗舆论。目前，中国和美国之间并没有战争。凡是规定美国部队继续占领中国领土、支持蒋介石、阻挠中国人民解放沿海岛屿和台湾的任何建议，都意味着加紧对中国进行挑衅，使危机恶化，并且增加世界大战的危险。
    “我们要求美国政府考虑世界舆论，并改变它的危险政策。
    “我们呼吁各国和平委员会和一切和平力量同全世界一切为和平而努力的人们联合起来，为结束美国对中国内政的干涉、制止美国的战争挑衅和侵略行动和要求美国部队立即全部撤出台湾海峡地区而展开一个声势浩大的运动。只有这样，这个地区的紧张局势才能得到缓和，世界大战的危险才能消除。”
