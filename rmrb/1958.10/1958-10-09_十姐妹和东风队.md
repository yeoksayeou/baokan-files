In the evening, Guihua's "Mu Guiying Team" was diligently cutting grass and accumulating fertilizer. Suddenly, the weather changed, the wind howled, and the crops on the canal滩 rattled, followed by copper-sized raindrops pattering down. Guihua straightened up, wiped the sweat from her face, looked at the sky, blinked her big eyes, and declared: "Let's stop for a moment and have a little meeting to discuss something!"

The nine young women stopped their sickles and gathered around Guihua.

"This matter is very important!" Guihua began. "To achieve our increased production plan, I propose that we fight through the night and fill the existing six fertilizer pits!"

"Agreed!"

Everyone said in unison.

"What about you, Chunlian, do you have any objections?"

"Hmph, always looking at people with old eyes! What am I! My daintiness is long gone!" Chunlian said unhappily, her mouth pouting high.

Guihua smiled with satisfaction, waved her hand and said loudly: "Good, everyone has no objections, then we will decide to launch a night attack, start immediately!"

The rain poured straight down as if the sky had broken; the thunder rumbled overhead. Guihua wiped the rain from her face and, borrowing a flash of lightning, looked at everyone and said, "How is it, does it feel too wet?"

"The wetter the fresher, we are not afraid of getting wet!" Chunlian replied loudly.

"That's right, our ten sisters must not be scared by the raindrops!" Before Guihua could finish speaking, Cuizhi spoke up: "It's not that we're scared, but it's so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face, how can we work if we can't see the grass? My hand got cut by the sickle!"

"Hey, you're too straightforward, why not use both hands to pull! That's what I'm doing, and it's not slow at all!" Someone shouted. Cuizhi shouted "That's right!" and threw down her sickle and started pulling.

Chunlian, in order to prove that she wasn't dainty, insisted on racing Guihua. Just as they were racing vigorously, suddenly a beam of light shot from the field not far away, followed by a rough voice: "Stop working, go home!"

When Guihua heard it was Qinglin, she quickly told Cuizhi in a low voice: "Think of a way to deal with him!" Cuizhi smiled secretly, stood up and rubbed the mud on her hands and asked, "Who asked you to call us back!"

"Team leader Wang Tingye."

It turned out that Wang Tingye, seeing that Guihua and the others hadn't returned home, knew that they were working late again. Feeling sorry for them, he immediately braved the rain to find Qinglin and asked him to call them back. Qinglin, on the one hand, felt sorry for his younger sister Cuizhi, and on the other hand, felt sorry for his fiancée Guihua, so he ran over with a flashlight without even bothering to bring an umbrella.

"Alright, go back, we've decided to fight through the night and not go home until dawn!" Guihua replied.

"No, Wang Tingye said you must go back!"

"We just won't go back! You men always say that we women can't do it, this time we have to show you what we can do!" Cuizhi confronted Qinglin. Guihua also chimed in: "Didn't you say that our 'Mu Guiying Team' is not as good as your 'East Wind Team'? Let's see who is really capable! We are not afraid of getting wet, we will definitely not go back!"

"Fine!" Qinglin was exasperated by them, and he "slurped" and left.

Not long after, Qinglin came with a group of young men. He said angrily: "Don't brag, let's start a competition, don't think you've been working longer, I guarantee we'll surpass you by dawn!"

"Good, we'll see whose legs are muddier when the water subsides, who is a rocket, and who is a clumsy pig!" Cuizhi抢着 replied.

The night was deep, the rain was still pouring down, and the competition between the two sides entered an intense stage. Suddenly, another beam of light shot from afar, followed by shouts: "Guihua—Guihua—"

When Qinglin heard Wang Tingye's voice, he quickly told the young men not to say a word and quickly hide, listening to Guihua's loud response.

It turned out that Wang Tingye didn't sleep after sending Qinglin away. He waited and waited, but never saw anyone, so he put on a麻袋片 and came to find them. When he saw Guihua covered in mud and water, looking like a drowned chicken, he felt both sorry and angry and said: "What are you trying to do, don't you want to live, go back to me!"

"It's alright. We are all made of iron, getting wet is more comfortable!" Guihua said with a smile. "Did you see where Qinglin went? This kid is really not doing his job, did he tell you to go back?"

"He did, but we didn't go back, and he brought people too!"

"Really? Where?" Wang Tingye asked in surprise.

"We're here!" Qinglin reluctantly replied as he walked up to Wang Tingye.

"Hey—you young people, really, really! Go home!"

"No, Wang Tingye, we're not going home, we won't stop until we've beaten this ten sisters!" As soon as Qinglin said this, Guihua and the others were furious:

"Hard to say, maybe someone else will lose!"

The shouts drowned out the sound of the rain, Wang Tingye sighed and said: "Hey, you're really giving me trouble, you young people..." Before he could finish speaking, Qinglin had already led the young men into the grass to work; Guihua also gave an order, and the "ten sisters" immediately scattered and started working. Wang Tingye晃着 the flashlight as he照着照着,扎麻袋片 and扎扎, said嗨 said了一声, and also squatted down to work.

    十姐妹和东风队
    田草
    傍晚，桂花领导的“穆桂英队”正在起劲地割着草，积着肥。忽然天色变了，风呜呜地刮起来，运河滩上的庄稼哗啦啦响成一片，接着铜钱大的雨点吧??往下掉。桂花直起腰，抹一把脸上的汗水，望望天，大眼一眨巴发话了：“咱们先停停，开个小会研究点事儿！”
    九名青年妇女停住镰，凑拢桂花坐下来。
    “这事很重要！”桂花开口了：“为了实现我们的增产计划，我提议咱们鏖战这一夜，一定要把现有的六个沤肥坑积满！”
    “同意！”
    大伙儿异口同声地说。
    “你呢，春莲，有意见吗？”
    “哼，老用老眼光看人，我是怎么的！我的娇气早没有了！”春莲不高兴地说着，嘴巴噘起老高。
    桂花满意地笑了笑，一挥手大声说：“好，大家都没意见，咱就决定连夜突击，马上开始！”
    雨，像破了天似的直泼直倒；雷，嘎嘎的叫着在头顶来回滚动。桂花抹抹脸上的雨水，借着闪光望望大伙儿说：“怎么样，淋的慌吗？”
    “淋淋更水灵，我们不怕淋！”春莲大声回答。
    “对，我们十姐妹绝不能让雨点子吓住！”桂花的话还没落音，翠枝发话了：“吓是吓不住，可黑得伸手不见五指，看不见草怎干呀？我的手叫镰打了个口子！”
    “嘿，你直心眼，不会俩手拔！我就拔呢，一点都不慢！”不知谁嚷了这么一句。翠枝喊了声“着哇！”把镰一扔拔起来。
    春莲为了证明自己没娇气了，非跟桂花赛赛不可。正赛得起劲儿的时候，忽然不远的地里射来一道电光，跟着响起一个粗声音“别干了，家走吧！”
    桂花一听是清林，忙一通翠枝小声说：“想法儿对付他！”翠枝暗笑了一下，站起身来揉着手上的稀泥问：“谁让你叫我们来！”
    “队长王亭爷。”
    原来王亭爷见桂花她们没回家，心知她们又熬上夜了，心疼她们，立时冒雨找到清林，让他来叫回她们。清林呢，一来是心疼自己的妹妹翠枝，二来是心疼自己的未婚妻桂花，所以他连雨伞都没顾得带，打着手电就跑来了。
    “好了，你回去吧，我们决定鏖战一夜，非等天亮才回家呢！”桂花回答。
    “不行，王亭爷说一定让你们回去！”
    “偏不回去！你们男的老说我们女的不行，这回非干个样给你们瞧瞧不行！”翠枝顶着清林。桂花也随和着说：“你不是说我们‘穆桂英’队不如你们‘东风队’吗？看看咱们到底是谁行！我们不怕淋，一定不回去！”
    “好！”清林被她们说急了，他“吃溜叭喳”地走了。
    没过多长时间，清林带着一群小伙子来了。他气冲冲地说：“你们甭吹，咱拉开战线试试看，甭看你们弄的时间长，保证天亮超过你们！”
    “好，出水再看两腿泥，看谁是火箭，谁是老笨猪！”翠枝抢着回答。
    夜已深了，雨还是哗哗地下着，双方竞赛进入了紧张的阶段。忽然远处又射来一道电光，随着传来一声声的叫喊：“桂花——桂花——”
    清林一听是王亭爷的声音，急忙通知小伙子们不准吭声，赶紧隐蔽起来，听凭桂花高声应答。
    原来王亭爷自打发清林走后，并没有睡觉。他等呀等的，老不见人影儿，就披上一条麻袋片找来了。他一瞅见桂花混身泥水，跟个落汤鸡一样，他又心疼又生气说：“你们这是要怎么着，不要命了，快给我回去！”
    “不碍。我们都是铁打的，淋淋更舒坦！”桂花笑着说。 “你们看见清林上哪去了？这个小子真不办事，他叫你们回去了吗？”
    “叫是叫了，我们没回去，他也带着人来了！”
    “是吗？在哪？”王亭爷惊异地问。
    “我们在这边哪！”清林无奈答应着走到王亭爷面前。
    “哎——你们这群年青人，真是，真是！快回家吧！”
    “不，王亭爷，我们不回家，今夜非把这个十姊妹比垮了不算罢休！”清林这么一说，桂花们可火了：
    “不好说，不定谁垮了呢！”
    嚷声盖住雨声，王亭爷叹口气说：“哎，真叫我遭难，你们这群小青年……”下边话还没出口，清林早领着小伙子们走入草地干起来；桂花也一声令下，“十姐妹”立时呼啦散开干起来。王亭爷晃着手电筒照着照着，把麻袋片一扎，“嗨”了一声也蹲下身子干起来。（附图片）
