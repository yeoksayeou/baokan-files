Wage System, Great Advantages
By our reporter Fang Huang

The Communist Party has good ideas, Chairman Mao's kindness is long,
Leading the people to establish people's communes. Workers and peasants' leap forward is guaranteed;
Basic wages plus bonuses, happy courtyards plus canteens,
Grain is implemented as a supply system; the roots of poverty are completely dug out;
Children have nurseries, women's labor is liberated,
Men and women, young and old, work hard; happy life knows no bounds.

This is a poem sung by members of the Satellite People's Commune in Chayashan, Suiping County, Henan Province, praising their implementation of the basic wage plus bonus and grain supply system. From September 1st, the Chayashan Satellite People's Commune began a new life, unrecorded in human history – farmers receiving wages and eating without spending money. All 40,000 members of the commune were immersed in a sea of joy. When the wage system and grain supply system were first implemented, although people agreed, some were still a little worried, fearing that some people would not work hard and lazy people would emerge. However, after the satellite commune implemented the wage system, not only did no lazy people appear, but also many commune members who were previously not active in production and ideologically backward became good commune members who were active in labor and cared about the collective.

Song Cuihua, a female commune member of the First Brigade, was known to everyone for either having a stomachache or back pain when she worked. When evaluating wages, she declared herself to be at the fourth grade, which immediately caused a dispute in the group. Many people criticized her past poor work attitude, lack of enthusiasm in meetings, and backward political thinking, and only agreed to rate her as the second grade. After being criticized, Song Cuihua made a self-criticism at the group meeting. The next day, she went to the fields early in the morning. In eight days, she accumulated fifteen carts of manure and turned over ten acres of sweet potato seedlings by herself. The commune members composed a clapper rhyme to praise her:

Wage system,
Great advantages,
Production is doing well,
Cuihua has changed,
Taking the lead everywhere,
Everyone praises her,
Next time rating,
Must be promoted.

Since the implementation of the wage system, more than 3,300 auxiliary laborers in the whole commune who had not participated in production for a long time have now begun to participate in production.

"Strive for the upstream, boost morale, everyone wants to be a hero" has now become a new fashion after the satellite commune implemented the wage system. A red flag competition campaign was launched throughout the commune. No matter which village, which brigade, or as long as there are commune members working in the fields or factories, there are red flags everywhere. Meng Xiuzhi, the women's captain of the Liuzhuang team of the First Brigade, was rated as the sixth grade, and the team members Yin Guirong and Wang Meirong were rated as the fifth grade. In order to catch up with Meng Xiuzhi, they launched a competition on a day in mid-September when they were turning sweet potato seedlings in the field. One moment Yin Guirong surpassed Meng Xiuzhi, and the next moment Meng Xiuzhi surpassed Yin Guirong, which made the passers-by dumbfounded. In the past, the highest daily attendance rate of this team was only 82%, but now, except for leave and meetings, the attendance rate has reached 100%, and even the elderly who are not labor forces have also attended. After the twenty commune members of the Second Team of the Third Brigade received their wages, the first evaluation resulted in four people winning the red flag, twelve people being active in labor, and four people winning the black flag. But by the second evaluation, all the black flags were eliminated, and three people also won the red flag.

In the satellite commune, all kinds of production are now developing by leaps and bounds. The movement to run steel in a big way and deeply plough the land is being carried out vigorously throughout the commune. A steel army of more than 5,000 people fights day and night on the mountains around the satellite commune, and tens of thousands of commune members harvest in the daytime and turn the land at night. They are determined to deeply plough all the land prepared for sowing wheat in the whole commune to a depth of one foot to one and a half feet within a month. In order to complete this arduous task, they put forward the slogan: "Fight the sun in the day and fight the stars at night, we will not withdraw until the task is completed," striving to launch a bigger wheat satellite next year.

### 工资制，好处大

    工资制，好处大
    本报记者　方徨
    共产党好主张，　毛主席恩情长，
    领导人民办公社。　工农跃进有保障；
    基本工资加奖励，　幸福院加食堂，
    粮食实行供给制；　穷苦根子全挖光；
    儿童有了托儿所，　妇女劳力得解放，
    男女老少拼命干；　幸福生活乐无疆。
    这是河南省遂平县嵖岈山卫星人民公社社员歌颂他们实行基本工资加奖励和粮食供给制的诗歌。从9月1日那天起，嵖岈山卫星人民公社开始了人类历史上所没有记载过的——农民领工薪，吃饭不花钱的新的生活，全社四万多社员，都沉浸在欢乐的海洋里。在开始实行工资制和粮食供给制的时候，人们虽然赞成，但也有人还有点耽心，害怕有些人不好好劳动，会出懒汉。但是卫星社实行工资制以后，不但没有出懒汉，而且许多过去生产不积极，思想落后的社员都变成劳动积极、关心集体的好社员了。
    一大队女社员宋翠花，人人都知道她干起活来不是肚子痛就是腰酸。评工资时，她自报四级，马上就引起小组里的争论。许多人批评她过去的劳动态度不好，开会不积极，政治思想落后，只同意评她为二级。经过批评以后，宋翠花在小组会上作了检讨。第二天，她一早就下了地。八天中，一个人就积了十五车粪，翻了十亩地红薯秧，社员们编了一首快板赞扬她：工资制，　好处大，生产搞得好，　翠花变了样，处处都带头，　人人把她夸，下次评级别，　一定得提拔。
    从工资制执行以来，全社有三千三百多个过去长期不参加生产的辅助劳动力，现在也都开始参加生产了。
      “争上游，鼓干劲，人人都要当英雄”，现在已成为卫星公社实行工资制以后的新风尚。全社展开了红旗评比竞赛运动。不论你走到那个村庄，那个大队，或者是只要有社员在工作的田间、工厂，到处都是红旗招展。一大队刘庄小队妇女队长孟秀芝被评为六级，这个小队的队员尹桂荣、王美荣被评为五级，她们两个为了赶上孟秀芝，9月中旬的一天，在地里翻红薯秧时，就展开了竞赛。一会儿尹桂荣超过了孟秀芝，一会儿孟秀芝又超过了尹桂荣，把过路的人们都看得呆了。这个小队过去每天最高的出勤率只有82％，现在除了请假、开会的，出勤率达到百分之百，不是劳动力的老年人也都出勤了。三大队二小队二十个社员发工资后第一次评比，得红旗的四个人，劳动积极的十二个人，还有四个人得了黑旗。可是到第二次评比时，全部消灭了黑旗，而且还有三个夺得了红旗。
    在卫星公社，各项生产现在都是突飞猛进的向前发展。全社大办钢铁，深翻土地的运动轰轰烈烈的开展起来了。五千多人组成的钢铁大军日夜苦战在卫星社周围的群山上，成千上万名的社员白天收秋，晚上翻地。他们决心在一个月以内要把全社准备播种小麦的全部土地深翻一尺到一尺五。为了完成这个艰巨的任务，他们提出：“白战太阳夜战星，任务不完不收兵”的口号，争取明年放射小麦更大的卫星。
