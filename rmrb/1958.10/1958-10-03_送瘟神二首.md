Two Poems on Seeing Off the God of Plague
Mao Zedong
Reading the People's Daily of June 30th, I learned that Yu Jiang County had eliminated schistosomiasis. My thoughts ran wild, and I couldn't sleep at night. A gentle breeze caressed, and the rising sun shone upon the window. Gazing at the southern sky, I gladly took up my pen.

Green waters and lush mountains are in vain so fair,
Hua Tuo helpless against a tiny worm's affair.
In thousands of villages, artemisia and tribulus mark where people relieve,
In myriad homes, desolation reigns, and ghosts sing with glee.
Sitting, I travel eighty thousand miles a day,
Surveying the heavens, I see a thousand rivers far away.
The Cowherd wishes to ask about the plague god's plight,
Sharing joys and sorrows, all swept away by the tide's flight.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 *
Spring breeze, willows in ten thousand strands so green,
Six hundred million in the divine land, all like Emperors Shun and Yao keen.
Red rain follows the heart's desire, turning into waves so high,
Green mountains intentionally transform into bridges across the sky.
Heaven connects to the Five Ridges as silver hoes descend,
Earth shakes in the Three Rivers as iron arms extend.
May I ask where the Plague Lord wishes to go?
Paper boats and bright candles light the sky with their glow.

     送瘟神二首
    毛泽东
    读六月三十日人民日报，余江县消灭了血吸虫。浮想联翩，夜不能寐。微风拂煦，旭日临窗，遥望南天，欣然命笔。绿水青山枉自多，华佗无奈小虫何？千村薜苈人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌。坐地日行八万里，巡天遥看一千河。牛郎欲问瘟神事，一样悲欢逐逝波。
                                  * 春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。红雨随心翻作浪，青山着意化为桥。天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。借问瘟君欲何往？纸船明烛照天烧。
