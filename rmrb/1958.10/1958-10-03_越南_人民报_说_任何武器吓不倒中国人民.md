Sidewinder Crosses the Street, Everyone Shouts to Beat It!
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 2nd. The "People's Daily" published a commentary today, strongly condemning the insane act of US imperialism in directing Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft to use missiles to provoke the Chinese people.

The commentary pointed out that the more frantic US imperialism becomes, the more the anti-American movement of the people of the world will rise, and they will more resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

The commentary said that this behavior of the United States is not only a military provocation attempting to invade China, but also an unforgivable provocation against peace-loving people all over the world. The commentary pointed out that while the Sino-US talks are being held in Warsaw, the United States is provoking China with missiles, which proves that the United States wants to use negotiations to cover up its activities of challenging and invading China. The United States' criminal acts have bankrupted Eisenhower's and Dulles's cunning arguments, and also exposed the essence of their demand for a Chinese "ceasefire."

The commentary said that the American warmongers have taken another step forward on the adventurous road of "playing with fire." The commentary pointed out that the Chinese people cannot be intimidated by any weapon, and no weapon can hinder the Chinese people's struggle to recover their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

    响尾蛇过街　人人齐喊打
    越南“人民报”说
    任何武器吓不倒中国人民
    新华社河内2日电“人民报”今天发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义指使蒋介石集团飞机使用导弹向中国人民进行挑衅的疯狂行为。
    评论指出，美帝国主义愈是疯狂，世界人民的反美运动就愈加高涨，而且会更加坚决地支持中国人民的正义斗争。
    评论说，美国的这种行为不但是企图侵略中国的军事挑衅行为，而且是对全世界爱好和平人民的不可宽恕的挑衅行为。评论指出，正当中美会谈在华沙进行的时候，美国用导弹向中国进行挑衅，这证明了美国想利用谈判来掩盖他对中国进行挑战和侵略的活动。美国的罪恶行为，使艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的狡诈论调破了产，也暴露了他们要求中国“停火”的本质。
    评论说，美国战争狂人又在“玩火”的冒险的道路上更前进了一步。评论指出，中国人民是任何武器也吓不倒的，任何武器都阻挠不了中国人民为收复自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿而进行的斗争。
