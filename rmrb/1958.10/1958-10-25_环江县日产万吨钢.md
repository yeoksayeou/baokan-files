    Huanjiang County Produces 10,000 Tons of Steel Daily
    (Our Dispatch) Following the launching of a large-scale iron smelting "satellite" on October 15th, Huanjiang County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region launched another steel smelting "satellite" on October 21st, with a daily output of 13,416 tons of steel.
    When the county party committee initially proposed a mass steelmaking campaign, some people lacked confidence. After visits and learning, the county trained over 10,000 steelmaking technicians in two days. Everyone displayed creativity, and a hundred flowers bloomed. In two days, they rebuilt and constructed over 10,000 various types of steelmaking furnaces and kilns. These included small furnaces producing several hundred kilograms per day, medium furnaces producing 4.5 tons per day, and large furnaces producing dozens of tons per day. In the movement to overcome steelmaking difficulties using indigenous methods, the people of the entire county and the support forces from Yishan and Hechi once again demonstrated the soaring energy of hard work, tough work, massive work, and skillful work. Qin Shanchao, a worker from the August 1st Factory, rushed into a furnace that had been shut down not long ago to repair it, wearing a mud-covered head and dark glasses, in order to save the blast furnace.
    Those participating in this battle included elderly people over sixty years old, children over nine years old, and a medical team of over four hundred medical personnel. There was also a strong logistics force that delivered large quantities of daily necessities to the front lines in a constant stream of vehicles. In this way, Huanjiang created the miracle of producing 13,416 tons of steel per day on October 21st.

    环江县日产万吨钢
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区环江县于本月15日大放炼铁卫星后，在10月21日又放出了日产钢一万三千四百一十六吨的炼钢卫星。
    当县委开始提出全民炼钢的时候，有的人是缺乏信心的，经过参观学习，全县在两天当中就培养出了一万多个炼钢技术人员，大家发挥创造性，百花齐放。两天之内就改建、兴建各种各样的炼钢炉，炼钢窑共一万多座。这些炉有日产数百公斤的小炉，有日产四点五吨的中炉，还有日产数十吨的大炉。在土法大破炼钢关的运动中，全县人民和宜山、河池的支援大军再次高度发挥了苦干、硬干、大干、巧干的冲天干劲，八一厂工人覃善超为了抢救高炉，用坭糊头，戴着黑镜，冲进一座停火不久的炉里去抢修。
    参加这次战斗的有六十岁以上的老人，也有九岁以上儿童，还有四百多位医务人员的医疗队。另外还有一支强大的后勤部队，车水马龙似地把大批的日用品送到阵地。就这样环江在10月21日创造了日产一万三千四百一十六吨钢的奇迹。
