Xinhua News Agency, Reykjavik, 11th: According to TASS, Reykjavik, 11th: Icelandic President Ásgeir Ásgeirsson on the 11th sternly condemned Britain's dispatch of warships to escort fishing fleets to illegally enter Icelandic fishing zones for fishing.

Ásgeirsson said that all Icelanders are united in the belief that the British should not be allowed to use warships or any other coercive action to resolve the Icelandic fishing zone issue. Whatever happens in this regard, no one should misunderstand Iceland's position on this matter. Ásgeirsson made these remarks when delivering a speech at the opening ceremony of the regular parliamentary session, according to traditional practice.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: London dispatch: According to a report in the "Scotsman" on the 8th, Icelandic Fisheries Minister Jónsson said that the vast majority of the Icelandic people advocate: the removal of the American military base in Iceland; lodging a complaint with the United Nations against British aggression for Britain's invasion of Iceland's fishing zone; and that Iceland's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should also be considered.

The "Scotsman" reported the above remarks made by Icelandic Fisheries Minister Jónsson to a reporter from the Icelandic "People's Will." In this conversation, Jónsson also said that during his recent speaking tour of northern and eastern Iceland, he discovered that the overwhelming majority of Icelanders also advocate: recalling the Icelandic ambassador to Britain, making no concessions on the issue of Britain's invasion of Iceland's fishing zone, and confiscating the equipment of foreign fishing boats that invade Iceland's fishing zone.

    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社雷克雅未克11日讯：冰岛总统欧斯盖尔森11日严词谴责英国派遣军舰护卫渔船队非法侵入冰岛捕鱼区捕鱼的行为。
    欧斯盖尔森说，所有冰岛人都一致认为不能容许英国人用军舰或任何其他强制行动来解决冰岛捕鱼区问题。无论在这方面发生什么情况，都不应该使任何人对冰岛的这种立场有所误解。欧斯盖尔森是在议会例会开幕式上按照传统惯例发表演说时说这番话的。
    新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：据“苏格兰人报”8日报道，冰岛渔业部长约瑟夫逊说，冰岛绝大多数人民都主张：撤除美国在冰岛的军事基地；就英国侵犯冰岛的捕鱼区的行为向联合国控告英国侵略；还应该考虑冰岛退出北大西洋集团的问题。
    “苏格兰人报”报道了冰岛渔业部长约瑟夫逊对冰岛“人民意志报”记者发表的上述谈话。在这次谈话中，约瑟夫逊还说，在他最近到冰岛北部和东部的演说旅行过程中，他发现冰岛压倒多数的人民还主张：召回冰岛驻英国的大使，在英国侵犯冰岛捕鱼区的问题上不作任何让步，并且没收侵犯冰岛捕鱼区的外国渔船的装备。
