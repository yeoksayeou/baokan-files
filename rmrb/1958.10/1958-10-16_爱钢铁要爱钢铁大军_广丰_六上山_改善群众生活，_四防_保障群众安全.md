(From our newspaper in Nanchang, October 15th) In the intense battle on the steel front, the CCP Guangfeng County Committee in Jiangxi Province actively adopted effective measures from various aspects to care for the people's lives and health, and to help the people overcome various difficulties.

In early September, Guangfeng County formed a mass movement to vigorously produce steel, with 150,000 people involved in the battle. Due to the rectification campaign and many political movements, their awareness was raised; coupled with the transition to communes, their production enthusiasm soared, and they worked hard day and night, rain or shine, on the steel front. Deng Yuejuan, a 70-year-old woman from Yongfeng Town, insisted on going up the mountain to mine ore despite people's dissuasion; she refused to leave the line of fire even when her palms were blistered. In order to produce thousands of tons of charcoal in a short period of time, another army fought day and night in the mountains of Panling and Luocheng. The common wish of the people was: to contribute to socialism and work for a happy life.

The CCP Guangfeng County Committee believes that, under such circumstances, leaders should cherish the people even more, and place the work of caring for their lives and protecting their health in an important position. To this end, the county committee actively took a series of effective measures in this regard to care for and take care of the people's welfare. Under the unified leadership of the general headquarters, a special organization—the Materials Allocation Committee—was established, responsible for supplying production and living materials on the steel front. Various places adopted the method of "Four Defenses" (disease prevention, fire prevention, accident prevention, sabotage prevention) and "Six Going to the Mountains" (peddlers, medicine, entertainment, post and telecommunications, barbering, straw sandals and rain hats going to the mountains). The county organized 300 peddlers to deliver daily necessities such as food and cigarettes to the mountains and furnaces, and set up one or two supply and marketing stations next to each construction site or furnace group to sell goods day and night; 21 medical teams were organized to circulate around various construction sites to treat diseases and strengthen prevention. Forty propaganda teams, with the participation of theater troupes and film projection teams, were organized to go deep into the mountains and furnace fronts to conduct propaganda and performance condolences, enriching people's cultural and recreational life. In terms of protection, one is to conduct safety production education frequently, and the other is to improve and add protective equipment according to existing conditions. Now, every furnace worker is equipped with simple protective equipment such as foot protectors. In terms of meals and accommodation, night meals have been increased, and pork and vegetables are often supplied; sheds have been built at construction sites and furnace sides, or private houses have been borrowed, so that people can eat well and sleep soundly after hard work.

The Party's care is meticulous. Under the unified arrangement of the county committee, women's welfare organizations were established at various construction sites, led by the women's directors of each township and commune to lead women's production, and it was stipulated that light physical labor such as ore dressing and weighing materials should be given priority to women. The people's communes also helped family members left behind to solve difficulties in various aspects such as firewood, rice, and water, so that those who went to the mountains could work with peace of mind. In addition, county committee leaders and working cadres ate, slept, and worked with the masses, took shifts for the masses at night, and often checked hygiene. Ding Shuqing, deputy secretary of the county committee, went to the workers' sheds every night to visit the workers and cover the young people with quilts. The masses said with emotion that the Communist Party took such good care of us, and it was as warm on the mountain as it was at home. They composed a song and sang: "The leaders are really concerned, the cadres and the masses are of one mind, labor is very happy, the more we fight, the more energetic we become." (Attached picture)

    爱钢铁要爱钢铁大军
    广丰“六上山”改善群众生活，“四防”保障群众安全
    本报南昌15日电　在钢铁战线的紧张战斗中，中共江西省广丰县委会积极从多方面采取有效措施，关怀群众的生活和身体健康，帮助群众克服种种困难。
    广丰县在9月上旬形成了大搞钢铁的群众运动，全县有十五万人投入战斗。由于经过整风和许多的政治运动，提高了觉悟；再加转入了公社后，生产劲头高涨，昼夜不分、风雨无阻地苦战在钢铁阵地上。永丰镇的七十岁的老婆婆邓月娟不顾人们劝阻，坚决上山挖矿石；手掌磨起血泡还不下火线。为了在短时期内生产出千吨木炭，还有一支大军日夜奋战在盘岭、罗城等地的丛山峻岭中。人们总的一个愿望是：为社会主义立功，为幸福生活劳动。
    中共广丰县委认为，在这种情况下，领导应该更加爱护群众，把关怀他们的生活和保护他们的健康等工作摆到重要地位上来。为此，县委便积极从这方面采取一系列的有效措施，关怀和照顾群众的生活福利，全县在总指挥部统一领导下，建立了专门组织——物资调拨委员会。专门负责供应钢铁战线上的生产和生活资料。各地采取“四防”（防病、防火、防事故、防破坏）和“六上山”（货郎担、医药、文娱、邮电、理发、草鞋雨笠上山）的办法，全县组织了三百个货郎担，送食品、香烟等日常用品上山上炉，并在每个工地旁或炉群里设立了一至二个供销站，日夜卖货；组织了二十一个医疗队在各工地巡回医病和加强预防。组织了有剧团和电影队参加的四十个宣传队，多次深入到山上、炉前宣传和演出慰问，丰富了人们的文娱生活。在防护方面，一是经常进行安全生产教育，一是根据现有条件来改进和增添防护设备。现在，每个炉前工人都备有护脚布等简单的防护用品。在膳食住宿方面，增加了夜餐，还经常供应猪肉和青菜；工地、炉旁都搭起了工棚或借用了民房，人们紧张劳动后，能吃得好、睡得甜。
    党的关怀是无微不至的。在县委统一安排下，各工地建立了妇女福利组织，由各乡、社妇女主任领导妇女生产，并规定选矿、称料等轻体力劳动优先让给妇女做。各人民公社还帮助留在后方的家属解决柴米用水等各方面的困难，使上山者安心劳动。此外，县委领导同志和工作干部与群众同吃同睡同劳动，晚上代群众值班，经常检查卫生。县委副书记丁术清每天夜晚都要到工棚里看望工人，给青年人盖被子。群众感动地说，共产党照顾我们真周到，在山上和在家里一样温暖。他们编歌唱道：领导真关心，干群一条心，劳动很高兴，越战越有劲。（附图片）
