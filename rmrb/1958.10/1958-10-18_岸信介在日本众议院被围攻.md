Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 17th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's remarks to NBC reporter Brown, which exposed his determination to act as a pawn for American aggression, were strongly condemned at a meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 16th.

Japanese Socialist Party member Tomi Narita said during questioning that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks exposed the essence of a militarist. Kishi Nobusuke's claim that "all feasible means should be taken to cooperate with the United States to prevent communist aggression" is to use the revision of the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" to cooperate with the U.S.-Chiang and U.S.-Rhee military treaties to establish a de facto "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization." Kishi Nobusuke's determination that the People's Republic of China is an "aggressor" and his expression of unwillingness to recognize it is hindering Sino-Japanese friendship. He said that Kishi Nobusuke should retract these remarks. He also refuted Kishi Nobusuke's nonsense that the Taiwan issue "is not a civil war, but an international issue."

Under the angry condemnation of Japanese public opinion, Kishi Nobusuke attempted to cover up the reactionary face exposed in his talk at this House of Representatives meeting. He denied that his remarks were inconsistent with what was published in the newspaper. Narita questioned him, if the report was wrong, why didn't he ask Brown to retract it? Kishi Nobusuke did not dare to answer directly, only saying that he would ask Brown to send back the recording of his conversation and then "study" it, attempting to evade the issue.

Kishi Nobusuke attempted to deny that he had directly said that Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which prohibits waging war, should be abolished. However, he admitted that he advocated that the Japanese Constitution, "including Article 9," should be studied and revised. Narita pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke wanted to revise this article of the Constitution for the purpose of sending troops abroad.

When defending himself, Kishi Nobusuke still stubbornly described the internal affairs of the Chinese people liberating their own territory of Taiwan as "an issue involving relevant parties with international ties," attempting to cover up the aggressive actions of the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs.

Japanese Socialist Party members Soji Okada and Mitsugi Habu also pointed out at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Councillors on the 16th that the issues involved in Kishi Nobusuke's remarks were serious, and the Socialist Party would question Kishi Nobusuke's true intentions at meetings of the House of Councillors' Steering Committee and plenary sessions, and explain the Socialist Party's views and positions.

Although Kishi Nobusuke attempted to deny the content of his conversation with Brown, Brown once again affirmed what Kishi Nobusuke said on NBC radio on the 15th. He greatly praised Kishi Nobusuke's imperialist remarks, such as "the time has come for Japan to play a full role in the struggle for the free world," and slandered China as an "aggressor," etc. He said that these words "spoken from the mouth of the Japanese Prime Minister are very powerful." He also believed that this was a major change in the policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, and that Kishi Nobusuke "is a good friend of the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 17th: The Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution held an emergency representative meeting in Tokyo this afternoon on the issue of Kishi Nobusuke telling an NBC reporter that Article 9 of the Constitution (regarding the abandonment of war) should be deleted. Afterwards, it issued a statement calling on the Japanese people to unite and wage a struggle against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government in order to defend the peace and democracy guaranteed by the Constitution. The statement pointed out that although Kishi Nobusuke argued that he did not say to the NBC reporter "Article 9 of the Constitution should be deleted," Kishi Nobusuke is obviously a supporter of the U.S. atomic strategy, and this kind of defense is not convincing.

    岸信介在日本众议院被围攻
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介对美国全国广播公司记者布朗发表的一篇暴露他决心充当美国侵略的走卒的谈话，16日在日本众议院会议上遭到了强烈谴责。
    日本社会党议员成田知已在质询时说，岸信介的谈话暴露了军国主义者的本质。岸信介所谓“要采取一切可行的办法同美国合作以防止共产主义侵略”，就是要用改订“日美安全条约”的办法，同美蒋和美李军事条约配合起来，建立事实上的“东北亚条约组织”。岸信介断定中华人民共和国是“侵略国”，并且表示不准备承认它，这样说是妨碍日中友好的。他说，岸信介应当取消这番话。他还驳斥了岸信介胡说什么台湾问题“不是内战，而是一个国际问题”的话。
    岸信介在日本舆论的愤怒谴责下，在这众议院会议上企图对他那次谈话中暴露出来的反动面目进行掩饰，他抵赖说，他的谈话同报上发表的不符。成田质问他，如果说报道有错误，为什么不要求布朗取消它？岸信介不敢正面回答，只表示要布朗把他的谈话的录音送回然后再作“研究”，企图搪塞过去。
    岸信介企图否认他直接说过要废除日本宪法中关于禁止进行战争的第九条。但是，他承认他主张日本宪法“包括第九条在内”，要加以研究修改。成田指出，岸信介想修改宪法的这一条，目的在于派兵出国。
    岸信介在为自己辩解时，仍然硬把中国人民解放自己的领土台湾的内政问题说成是“一个有关当事国之间的、有国际连带关系的问题”，妄图这样来给美国干涉中国内政的侵略行动打掩护。
    日本社会党议员冈田宗司和羽生三七16日在参议院外务委员会会议上也指出，岸信介这次谈话中涉及的问题严重，社会党将在参议院议院运营委员会会议和全体会议上追问岸信介的真正意图，并且说明社会党的看法和立场。
    虽然岸信介企图抵赖他向布朗发表的谈话的内容，布朗15日在美国全国广播公司电台上再一次肯定了岸信介所说的那些话。他大肆赞扬岸信介这些帝国主义的言论，例如“日本准备在为自由世界而进行的斗争中起充分作用的时候已经来临”，诬蔑中国为“侵略者”等等。他说，这些话“出自日本首相之口，很有力量”。他并且认为这是岸信介政府政策的重大改变，岸信介“是美国的好朋友”。
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本拥护宪法国民联合会今天下午在东京就岸信介向美国全国广播公司记者表示应该删除宪法第九条（关于放弃战争的条款）的问题举行了紧急代表会议，随后发表声明，呼吁日本国民团结起来，为保卫宪法所保障的和平、民主而对岸信介政府的反动政策展开斗争。声明指出，虽然岸信介辩解他并没有向美国全国广播公司记者说过“应该删除宪法第九条”，可是，岸信介显然是支持美国原子战略的人，这种分辩是不能令人相信的。
