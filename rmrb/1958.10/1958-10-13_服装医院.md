    Clothing Hospital

    A special clothing store has recently opened in Shanghai. It doesn't stock merchandise or make new clothes, but specializes in treating all kinds of "difficult and complicated diseases" of clothing, doing everything possible to extend the life of clothes for people.

    If your clothes are torn, the thread has come loose, or a button is missing, take them to this clothing store called Qiao Kang, and the sewing workers will immediately sew, mend, and re-attach, ready while you wait. If a shirt collar is worn, they can replace it or turn the collar. If clothes are too big, they will alter them to be smaller; if they are too short, they will lengthen them, trying all kinds of ways to make them fit.

    Old clothes can be taken to be remodeled and renovated; outdated old-style cheongsams can be changed into popular Western-style shirts, skirts, or vests. Old men's suit pants can be altered into women's pants or skirts, and even already worn-out clothes can be made into all kinds of beautiful children's clothing.

    The store entrance is marked with the seven large characters "Repair clothes regardless of price." Generally, repairs are paid for at the customer's discretion, with money placed in the cash box on the counter. For some more complicated handwork, the customer and the staff discuss and decide the price based on the length of repair time and the amount of materials used. The fabrics used by the store to repair clothes are all leftover scraps from nearby clothing stores that cannot be reused, so generally, customers are not asked for cloth coupons.

    Since the store opened, it has been widely praised by workers, residents, and especially single men in the surrounding area. (Ye Shitao) (With picture)

    服装医院
    上海新开了一家特殊的服装店，它不备商品，也不缝制新装，而是专门医治衣服上的各种“疑难杂症”，为人们想尽一切办法延长衣服的寿命。
    如果你的衣服磨破了洞，脱了线或者掉了钮扣，拿到这家名叫乔康的服装店去，缝纫工人马上给你缝补配钉，立等可取。衬衫破了领子，他们可以给你换领，也可以给你翻领。衣服太大，他们会给你改小；短了又给你改长，想各种办法使你穿了合身。
    破旧衣服可以拿去改制翻新；过时的老式旗袍可以改成流行的西式衬衫、裙子或背心。旧的男式西装裤可以改女裤、女裙，那怕是已经穿破的衣服也能改成各式各样漂亮的童装。
    商店门口写着“修补服装不论价”七个大字。一般修补都由顾客随意付费，自己把钱投入柜台上的收银箱里。有些手工比较复杂的衣服，由顾客按照修补时间长短和用料多少同职工研究决定。商店修补衣服的布料都是附近服装店裁剪余下来无法再用的零料碎料，因此一般不向顾客索取布票。
    这家商店开张以来，附近一带的工人、居民特别是单身汉们普遍称便。　（叶世涛）（附图片）
