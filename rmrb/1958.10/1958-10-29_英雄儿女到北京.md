    Heroic Sons and Daughters Arrive in Beijing
    By Our Staff Reporter
    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, led by General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, triumphantly returned to Beijing this afternoon, holding high the victorious red flag of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.
    As the triumphant train carrying the heroes pulled into Beijing Railway Station, the station erupted in deafening sounds of gongs, drums, firecrackers, and cheers. As soon as General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping stepped out of the train, Premier Zhou Enlai, who was waiting on the platform, greeted them with a beaming smile and shook General Yang Yong's hand tightly, saying, "On behalf of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on behalf of the government and the people of the whole country, I extend the warmest welcome to you—the victorious heroes!" At this moment, tens of thousands of people cheered in unison: "Welcome to the most beloved people!" "Salute to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" A group of lively children from the capital presented red scarves and large bouquets to the respected "Volunteer Army Uncles."
    Subsequently, General Yang Yong, General Wang Ping, and others, accompanied by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing, and others, rode in five open-top cars as the vanguard, slowly heading towards the Beijing Hotel, passing through a crowd of 200,000 people lining the streets and cheering. Everywhere the triumphant heroes passed, the streets and buildings along the streets, as well as high-rise buildings, were packed with welcoming crowds. In the sea of colorful flags and flowers, tens of thousands of excited hearts poured out their inner feelings of gratitude to the heroes.
    The heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, on the thousand-mile journey from Andong to the capital, also received warm welcomes from their compatriots whom they had been separated from for eight years, in every city and station they passed.
    In Andong City, on the 27th at noon, the heroic people formed a welcoming line more than three miles long, from Youth Square in the suburbs, through the city center, to the train station. They used flowers and colorful confetti to pave a "Road of Glory" for the heroes. Every household, men, women, old and young, came to see the heroes off to Beijing. An old man with a flowing white beard held Commander Yang Yong's hand and said, "Hurry to Beijing to see our Chairman Mao. You are the greatest glory of us Chinese people!"
    The triumphant train carrying the heroes sped towards Beijing. The vast land of the motherland was jubilant. Look, red flags were flying everywhere. The vast army of farmers fighting in the fertile fields, the militia divisions fighting on the reservoir construction sites, the transportation teams driving their carts on the highways, the steelworkers who ignited brilliant flowers in the high furnace clusters... their hearts, which had been thinking of the heroic sons and daughters day and night, opened up
  and were excited! From all directions, tens of millions of
  eyes were gazing at this colorful "giant dragon," tens of millions of arms were waving, and throats were cheering:
  "Welcome to our most beloved people!"
    The people of the Shenyang area, after a hard day's work, rushed to the train station, decorated with lanterns and colorful decorations, and set off firecrackers to welcome the returning heroes. In Jinzhou City, more than 2,500 people braved the early winter cold late at night, waiting at the station to welcome their loved ones passing through. When the train passed through "Shanhaiguan," and passed through Tangshan on the morning of the 28th, more than 2,000 workers, farmers, women, and children who had been waiting at the station for a long time also surged over like a tide to meet the heroes intimately. More than 3,000 people in Tianjin decorated the station with red flags and flowers, turning it into a large garden, while tens of thousands of laborers along the railway also lined the streets to wave goodbye to the heroic train heading towards the capital.
    The great victory, the glorious reunion, brought so much happiness, joy, and grateful tears to the people! At Shenyang Railway Station, a little girl wearing a red satin jacket, Ren Lujiang, personally tied a red scarf around General Yang Yong's neck. Lieutenant General Liang Biye gave the white veil that a Korean girl had given him to the little girl. The girl stroked the veil and softly read the words on the veil: "We will never forget the merits of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" Her young heart was moved, and she naively said: "We must not forget the merits of the Volunteer Army uncles either." At this time, Park Kyung-ja, a sixteen-year-old Korean war orphan studying technology at the Shenyang Transformer Factory, also presented a large bouquet of flowers to the generals. Her large teardrops fell on the blooming flowers. She, an orphan whose parents were taken away by the American invaders, had lived in the Volunteer Army for a year. She said: "My life is inseparable from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Without the Volunteer Army saving me, without the Chinese people nurturing and educating me like a mother, I would not be where I am today." At Jinzhou Railway Station, late at night, Qi Yongsheng, a venerable 74-year-old man with a full silver beard, came. He was a respectable Red Army soldier. He excitedly said to Wang Huyuan and Zhao Jihua, "Second-Class Heroes" of the Volunteer Army who wore the North Korean "National Flag Medal" on their chests: "You defeated the American bandits in Korea and defended our country. Our descendants will never forget you." In Tianjin, Yang Yupu, the father of the famous climbing hero Yang Liandi, also made a special trip to the station to welcome them. General Ding Laifu, with high respect, presented flowers to the hero's father on behalf of all officers and soldiers. Peng Shuying, an advanced producer in Tianjin and a female worker at the Tianjin Textile Equipment Factory, took off her advanced producer medal and pinned it on the chest of Wang Zhanshan, a second-class hero of the Volunteer Army. She excitedly said: "I worked all night last night, and when I heard that you had returned victoriously, I forgot my fatigue and came early today to welcome you." Wang Zhanshan also gave his "Sino-Korean Friendship" commemorative medal to Peng Shuying. They encouraged each other to make joint leaps forward on the front lines of building and defending the motherland.
    On the road from Andong to Beijing, the "one day equals twenty years" Great Leap Forward of the motherland attracted and inspired the returning heroes. Their fiery hearts jumped with the clanging of the train, and their moist and bright eyes were glued to the train windows, intently staring at the beloved land and the beloved people that they had left for eight years and were now stepping on again. General Yang Yong excitedly said to General Wang Ping: "It has changed, everything in the motherland has changed so fast!" Eight years ago, it was still barren land, but now it is a green wheat field; eight years ago, it was still a dilapidated wooden bridge, but now steel bridges have been erected; those individual farmers are gone, and everywhere are labor armies fighting under the red flag; those towering chimneys are no longer lonely, and along the railway, how many more high furnaces and chimneys are lined up! Whether they were seasoned generals or heroic soldiers from Maryang Hill, Old Baldy, and the Imjin River, they all watched the small high furnaces springing up everywhere in the motherland with greater interest and cheered for the nationwide steelmaking movement launched by the great motherland. Wang Huyuan, a heroic company commander, said: "The enemy can destroy, but we can build. The power of the people is invincible!" Li Zongshi, an engineering soldier who had won a second-class merit in the restoration and construction project of Pyongyang, said enthusiastically that he would definitely use the energy of building Pyongyang to participate in the construction of the motherland.
    When the train was about to arrive at the long-awaited capital of the motherland, their hearts were even more excited. The sun was shining brightly, and songs were floating in the air. The members of the Volunteer Army Art Troupe, known as the "Anti-American and Aid Korea Art Light Cavalry," accompanied by accordions, sang a beautiful song: "...The motherland is flying on the east wind, the Volunteer Army soldiers come to sing praises to you, the construction of the motherland is like the eastern sun, and the hearts of the Volunteer Army soldiers are also bright. The wind of the motherland blowing on the body is refreshing, the water of the motherland drinking in the mouth is sweet and fragrant, the high mountains of the motherland are smiling at us, and the rivers of the motherland are singing to us. Motherland, hometown! I have been thinking about you day and night for eight years, and now I am back by your side, forever be the most beloved person, and forever fight in the place where the motherland needs it most!"

    英雄儿女到北京
    本报记者
    以中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将和政治委员王平上将为首的中国人民志愿军代表团，高举着抗美援朝斗争的胜利红旗，在今天下午荣归北京。
    当英雄们乘坐的凯旋列车驶进北京车站时，车站上响起了震天的锣鼓声、鞭炮声和欢呼声。杨勇上将和王平上将等刚走出车门，等候在月台上的周恩来总理便笑容满面地迎上前去，紧紧地握着杨勇上将的手说：“我代表党中央和毛主席，代表政府和全国人民，最热烈地欢迎你们——胜利凯旋的英雄们！”这时，千万人齐声欢呼：“欢迎最可爱的人！”“向英雄的中国人民志愿军致敬！”一群活泼的首都孩子把红领巾和大把花束献给了敬爱的“志愿军叔叔”们。
    随后，杨勇上将、王平上将等由中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若、北京市市长彭真等陪同，分乘五辆敞篷轿车作前导，穿过二十万人夹道欢呼的群众行列，徐徐驶向北京饭店。凯旋英雄们所过之处，街道上和沿街两旁的楼房上、高层建筑物上，到处都挤满了欢迎的人群。在彩旗和鲜花的海洋里，千万颗激动的心，向英雄们倾吐着内心的感激之情。
    祖国的英雄儿女们，在从安东驱车驶往首都的千里道路上，每经过一城一站，也都处处受到了阔别八年的祖国亲人的热情欢迎。
    英雄的安东市人民在27日中午，从市郊的青年广场穿过市区一直到火车站，排成了三里多长的欢送行列，他们用鲜花和彩色纸屑为英雄们铺设了一条“光荣路”，家家户户、男女老幼，都来欢送英雄们去北京。一位白须飘然的老大爷握着杨勇司令员的手说：“快到北京去见咱毛主席吧。你们是咱们中国人的最大光荣！”
    凯旋列车载着英雄们向北京奔驰。祖国的万里江山都在欢腾。看吧，红旗遍地飘扬。在肥沃的田野上战斗的农民劳动大军，在水库工地上战斗的民兵师团，在公路上扬鞭策马的运输大队，在高炉群中燃起灿烂之花的钢铁战士们……他们日夜怀念着英雄儿女们的心打开
  了，激动了！从四面八方，千万只
  眼睛凝眸着这条彩色的“巨龙”，千万只手臂在挥舞，喉咙在欢呼：
  “欢迎我们最可爱的人！”
    沈阳地区的人民带着一天的辛劳，赶到火车站，张灯结彩，燃起鞭炮，欢迎凯旋归来的儿女们。锦州市两千五百多人民深夜里还冒着初冬的寒风，等候在车站上，迎接过路的亲人。当列车穿过“山海关”，在28日清晨路过唐山的时候，久候在车站上的两千多名工人、农民、妇女和儿童，也海潮般地涌过来，和英雄们亲切相见。天津市的三千多人民用红旗和鲜花把车站织成了一个大花园，同时还有成千上万的劳动在铁路两旁的人们，夹道欢送英雄列车向首都驰进。
    伟大的胜利，光荣的重逢，给人们带来了多少幸福、喜悦和感激的热泪啊！在沈阳车站，一位穿着红缎袄的小姑娘任鲁江，把一条红领巾亲手系在杨勇上将的脖子上。梁必业中将把朝鲜小姑娘送给他的白色纱巾，转送给这位小姑娘。姑娘用手抚弄着纱巾，轻轻地念着纱巾上边的几个字：“我们永远不能忘记中国人民志愿军的功勋！”她小小的心灵被感动了，天真地说：“我们也不能忘记志愿军叔叔的功劳。”这时，一位在沈阳变压器厂学习技术的朝鲜战灾孤儿——十六岁的朴敬子，也把大束鲜花捧在将军们面前，她的大颗泪珠滴在盛开的花朵上。她，这个被美国侵略者夺去了双亲的孤儿，曾在志愿军部队里生活过一年。她说：“我的生命是和中国人民志愿军分不开的。没有志愿军救我，没有中国人民像母亲一样地抚养和教育，我就没有今天。”在锦州车站上，深夜里，走来了满面银须、七十四岁的老人齐永胜，他是一位可敬的红军战士。他激动地同胸前佩戴着朝鲜“国旗勋章”的志愿军“二级英雄”王虎元、赵积华说：“你们在朝鲜打败了美国强盗，保卫了咱们的国家，我们子孙后代都忘不了你们。”在天津，著名的登高英雄杨连第烈士的父亲杨玉璞，也特意赶到车站欢迎。丁莱夫将军怀着崇高的敬意，代表全体官兵把鲜花献给了英雄的父亲。天津市先进生产者、天津纺织器材厂女工彭淑英摘下自己的先进生产者奖章佩在志愿军二级英雄王占山的胸前，她激动地说：“我昨夜炼了一夜钢，听说你们胜利回来，忘了疲劳，今天很早赶来欢迎。”王占山也把自己的“朝中友谊”纪念章赠给了彭淑英。她们互相勉励在建设和保卫祖国的战线上共同跃进。
    在从安东到北京的道路上，祖国“一天等于二十年”的大跃进面貌，吸引和激奋着凯旋而归的英雄儿女们。他们的火热的心伴随着列车的铿锵声欢跳，润湿而明亮的眼睛紧贴在车窗上，全神贯注地凝视着阔别了八年而又重新踏上的亲爱的土地，亲爱的人民。杨勇将军向王平将军激奋地说：“变啦，祖国的一切都变得多快呀！”八年前，还是荒芜的土地，现在是一片绿油油的麦田；八年前还是破烂的木桥，现在已架起了钢铁桥梁；那些单干的农民不见了，到处是战斗在红旗下的劳动大军；那些高耸的烟囱不再孤独了，沿铁路两旁，又排列着多少高炉和烟囱！不论是身经百战的将军们，还是来自马良山、老秃山和临津江畔的英雄战士们，他们都以更大的兴趣注视着祖国遍地蜂起的小高炉，为伟大祖国展开的全民炼钢运动而欢呼。英雄连长王虎元说：“敌人能破坏，我们能建设。人民的力量是无敌的！”曾经在参加平壤市恢复建设工程中立了二等功的工兵战士李宗诗激昂地表示，他一定要用建设平壤的干劲，参加祖国的建设。
    当列车就要到英雄们久已向往的祖国首都的时候，他们的心更激动了。阳光灿烂，歌声飘荡。被誉为“抗美援朝文艺轻骑队”的志愿军文艺工作团员们，伴着手风琴，唱起了一支美丽的歌：“……祖国乘着东风飞翔，志愿军战士来把你歌唱，祖国的建设就像东方的太阳，志愿军战士心里也亮堂堂。祖国的风吹在身上精神爽，祖国的水喝在嘴里甜又香，祖国的高山在向我们微笑，祖国的江河在向我们欢唱。祖国，故乡！离别八年日夜想，如今回到您的身旁，永远做个最可爱的人，永远战斗在祖国最需要的地方！”
