Where are the "Conditionism" People Wrong?
Zhu Bo

Whenever a new task is assigned, there are always some "Conditionism" people on the sidelines shouting that this condition is not sufficient, that condition is not sufficient. It sounds like there are many difficulties, and it seems that the work cannot be carried out at all. However, facts have proved that every task has been completed, and the "Conditionism" people have failed every time. They have failed again and again, so what is their fundamental mistake? Their fundamental mistake lies in not understanding the mass line, not believing in the wisdom and power of the masses. The recent development of rural hospitals and maternity hospitals across the country fully illustrates this point.

According to statistics, more than 58,000 rural maternity hospitals and rural hospitals have been developed across the country. Many counties and special districts in various provinces and autonomous regions have achieved communization of maternity hospitals and hospitals. These hospitals were all established by mobilizing the masses. The hospitals used the old earthen houses of agricultural cooperatives, and the medicines and medical equipment were purchased by the masses through fundraising. Some were created by the medical staff themselves. Some hospitals also opened pharmaceutical factories. Most of the medical personnel in the hospitals are rural youths trained in the form of hygiene training classes in various places, and they have also absorbed local Western and Chinese medicine practitioners. This is a strong medical and health team in the countryside, which strongly supports agricultural production.

People still remember that not long ago, those "Conditionism" people in the health department were still spreading the erroneous view that rural areas could not afford to build hospitals and maternity hospitals. Their reasons were that rural areas currently do not have the economic strength to build hospitals, purchase medicines and medical equipment; the state also does not have the strength to train enough medical personnel to send to rural areas... When the fact that some areas have established hospitals and maternity hospitals refuted their erroneous arguments, they said that the "conditions" there were good, and the "conditions" here were poor. Some even suggested that farmers are superstitious and backward, and no one would be hospitalized even if they were built. Regardless of the motives of the "Conditionism" people, the effect is very harmful. Especially in today's all-round leap forward in national construction, all tasks need mutual support. If we follow the ideas of the "Conditionism" people, rural health work cannot develop rapidly, and the backwardness of rural medical and maternal and child health cannot be quickly changed. This will inevitably affect the development of agricultural production. The "Conditionism" people are wrong again. They are wrong in not seeing the most important condition: the masses—the people. Isn't the fact so clearly displayed in front of us? When the broad masses have been mobilized, they will create all kinds of favorable conditions and will turn some conditions that are unfavorable to the work into conditions that are conducive to the work. For example, mountainous areas, which are considered by the "Conditionism" people to have the worst "conditions", with scattered residents, inconvenient transportation, and cultural backwardness. However, because the masses are often threatened by diseases, the masses urgently demand to change the backwardness of medical and maternal and child health in mountainous areas. Isn't this the most favorable condition for running hospitals and maternity hospitals?

The collective strength of the masses is the most favorable condition for us to complete a task. No matter what the task is, as long as we believe in the collective strength of the masses and make full use of this, the work can develop rapidly and achieve great results. Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, has done a good job in rural maternity hospitals and hospital work because they have fully mobilized the masses and relied on the strength of the masses. For example, the masses in Baiwang Township in this county spontaneously proposed the slogan "One egg per person, don't ask the commune for a penny, women build their own maternity hospitals." In five days, they donated more than 35,200 eggs, solving the funding problem for running maternity hospitals and hospitals. After mobilizing the masses in Sanqu Township, the masses went to the agricultural cooperatives to inquire about what was needed to run a hospital. They sent whatever was needed. Some sent bed boards, doors and windows, firewood and grass, and glass bottles. Therefore, maternity hospitals and hospitals were quickly established.

The "Conditionism" people should learn a lesson. In the future, when encountering problems, don't make conclusions lightly, but go to the masses to talk and learn from the masses to see what the masses say, so that the "Conditionism" thinking can be gradually overcome.

    “条件论”者错在哪里？
    朱波
    每当布置一件新的工作的时候，总有一些“条件论”者在一旁喊叫这也不够条件，那也不够条件，听起来好像是困难重重，似乎工作真的一点都不能进行。但是，事实证明，每次工作都完成了，“条件论”者每次都失败了。他们一再失败，到底错在哪里呢？他们的根本错误在于不懂得群众路线，不相信群众的智慧和力量，从最近全国各地农村医院和产院的发展情况就充分地说明这一点。
    根据统计，全国各地已经发展了五万八千多所农村产院和农村医院，各省和自治区已经有很多县和专区实现了社社产院化和医院化。这些医院都是发动群众办起来的。医院是利用农业社的旧土房，医药和医疗器具是群众集资购买的，有些是医务人员自己创造的。有的医院还开办制药厂。各医院的医务人员大部分是各地用卫生训练班形式培养出来的农村青年，并吸收了当地西医和中医。这是农村中一支强大的医疗卫生队伍，它有力地支援了农业生产。
    人们都还记得，就在不久以前，卫生部门中的那些“条件论”者还在那里散布农村办不起医院和产院的错误论调。他们的理由是，农村目前没有经济力量修建医院、购制医药和医疗设备；国家也没有力量培养足够的医务人员派到农村去……当某些地区建立起医院和产院的事实，驳斥了他们那种错误论调的时候，他们却又说人家那里“条件”好，我们这里“条件”差，甚至有人提出农民迷信落后，办起来也没有人住院。不管“条件论”者的动机如何，其效果是非常有害的。尤其是祖国建设全面跃进的今天，各项工作都需要互相支援，如果按照“条件论”者的想法，农村卫生工作就不能飞跃发展，农村医疗和妇幼卫生的落后面貌也不能迅速地得到改变。这样就必然会影响农业生产的发展。“条件论”者又错了。错在看不到群众——人的这一最重要的条件。事实不是这样清清楚楚摆在面前吗？广大群众已经发动起来，他们就会创造出各种有利的条件，并且会把一些不利于工作的条件变为对工作有利的条件。例如山区，这是“条件论”者认为“条件”最差的地区，群众居住分散，交通不便和文化落后，但是，由于群众经常受到疾病的威胁，而使群众迫切要求改变山区医疗和妇幼卫生的落后面貌。这不是办医院和产院的最有利的条件吗？
    群众的集体力量是我们完成一件工作的最有利的条件，不论任何工作，只要相信群众的集体力量，并充分地利用这一条，工作就能够飞跃发展，就能够取得巨大成绩。陕西省泾阳县农村产院和医院工作做得好，原因就在于他们充分发动群众，依靠群众的力量。例如，这个县白王乡群众自动提出“一人一个鸡蛋，不要社里一文钱，妇女自己建产院”的口号，五天的时间就捐献出三万五千二百多个鸡蛋，解决了办产院和医院的经费问题。三渠乡发动群众之后，群众纷纷到农业社去打听办医院需要什么东西。他们提出需要什么就送什么。有的送床板、门窗、柴草和玻璃瓶等，因此，很快的办起了产院和医院。
    “条件论”者应当记取教训。今后再遇到问题的时候，先不要自己轻下结论，而要先到群众中去谈谈，向群众学习，看看群众怎么说，这样“条件论”的思想，才能逐步得到克服。
