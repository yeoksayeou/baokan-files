Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 5th. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party met in Ivry on the 3rd and 4th, listened to and discussed Marcel Servin's report on the political situation after the referendum, and passed a corresponding resolution.

    The resolution first pointed out that the passage of the constitution was a retreat for French democracy; this event has created a serious situation.

    The social forces of big capital, supporting the policies pursued for the past decade under the dual banner of anti-communism and subservience to US imperialism, supported the May 13th coup and campaigned for the passage of the constitution. These forces are attempting to seek a way out by establishing an anti-democratic regime in order to more easily force the masses to bear the consequences arising from the policies they demand to implement for their selfish class interests.

    The resolution then analyzed the actions of the De Gaulle government. The resolution pointed out that the Algerian war is still going on. Colonial policy has become clear due to the government's attitude towards Guinea, which is based on refusing to recognize the legitimacy of national rights and refusing the principle of equality of rights for the people of all federal states.

    The resolution said that the government's foreign policy is still based on the Atlantic Pact and escalating international tensions. The French government is considering strengthening the North Atlantic Group by establishing a close alliance with revanchist West Germany and France's participation in the atomic arms race.

    Finally, the living standards of workers are constantly declining.

    The resolution pointed out that this policy, which is dangerous to both peace and France, shows that France is increasingly dependent on the United States and West Germany. The result of such a policy will be to exacerbate impoverishment.

    The resolution concluded by saying that, faced with the new situation created by the passage of the constitution, the French Communist Party has decided to continue the struggle through democratic means to defend freedom and restore democracy. The French Communists will enthusiastically dedicate themselves to the organization and unity of mass movements to achieve the following goals: to stop the Algerian war and establish new relations between France, Algeria, and other overseas countries through negotiations based on free consent and equal rights; to ensure peace by easing international tensions and stopping the arms race; to improve the living standards of workers in urban and rural areas by meeting their demands, to provide the country with the necessary funds to develop education, as well as scientific and technological research, and to pave the way for the future of young people; to maintain public freedom and take action to expand these freedoms.

    戴高乐“宪法”通过后法国局势严重
    法共决定加紧斗争保卫民主
    指出戴高乐反动政策将导致祸国殃民恶果
    新华社巴黎5日电　法国共产党中央委员会3日和4日在伊符里开会，听取和讨论了马赛尔·赛尔文关于公民投票以后的政治局势的报告，并且通过了相应的决议。
    决议首先指出，宪法获得通过是法国民主制的后退；这件事造成了严重的局势。
    大资本的社会力量支持十年来在反共和屈从美帝国主义的双重标志下奉行的政策，支持5月13日的政变，为通过宪法进行了宣传。这些力量企图以建立反民主政权来寻求出路，以便更容易地强迫人民群众来承担由于它们自私自利的阶级利益所要求执行的政策而产生的后果。
    决议接着分析了戴高乐政府的行动。决议指出，阿尔及利亚战争还在继续进行。殖民政策已经由于政府对几内亚采取的态度而昭然若揭，这种态度是以拒绝承认民族权利的合法性为基础的，是以拒绝联邦各国人民权利平等的原则为基础的。
    决议说，政府的外交政策仍然是以大西洋公约和加剧国际紧张局势为基础的。法国政府正在考虑通过同复仇主义的西德建立亲密联盟和法国参加原子军备竞赛来加强北大西洋集团。
    最后是劳动者的生活水平正在不断下降。
    决议指出，这种对和平和对法国都具有危险性的政策，表明法国越来越依赖美国和西德。这样的政策，其结果将是加剧贫困化。
    决议最后说，面临宪法通过后所造成的新局势，法国共产党决定通过民主途径继续进行斗争，以争取保卫自由和恢复民主制。法国共产党人将热情地致力于群众运动的组织和团结工作，以达到下述目标：制止阿尔及利亚战争，通过在自由同意和权利平等的基础上进行的谈判建立法国、阿尔及利亚和其他海外国家之间的新关系；通过缓和国际紧张局势和停止军备竞赛确保和平；通过满足城乡劳动者的权利要求来提高他们的生活水平，使国家有必要的经费发展教育以及科学和技术研究，为青年的前途开辟道路；维护公众的自由，并采取行动来扩大这些自由。
