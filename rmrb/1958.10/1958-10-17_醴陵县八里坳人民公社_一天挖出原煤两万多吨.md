Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: Members of the Eight Mile Ridge People's Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province, dug out 20,215 tons of raw coal at the Niu Ya Hong Coal Mine on the 13th, setting the highest record for daily raw coal output by a people's commune in the province.

The Niu Ya Hong Coal Mine has abundant coal reserves; in some places, coal is found just three feet below the surface. The quality of the coal is very good, with 70% suitable for coking. However, in the past, there was only one small coal kiln operating on this coalfield, producing less than 100 tons per day. After the establishment of the Eight Mile Ridge People's Commune, the members actively requested open-pit mining in this area. On October 2nd, the commune's Party committee organized a 3,600-strong coal mining force, who worked tirelessly for five days and nights, and on October 7th, they uncovered 80 acres of mountain cover. On the 8th, they produced 5,050 tons of coal, establishing a red flag for high-yield in small coal mines throughout Hunan Province. Then, on the 13th, they launched a "satellite" of 20,215 tons of raw coal per day.

Now, the commune members are even more enthusiastic. They are adding winches, cableways, chutes and other transportation tools to the construction site, determined to create new records of 30,000, 50,000, 100,000 tons, or even higher, per day.

Driven by the Eight Mile Ridge People's Commune, coal production in Liling County has also seen a leap in growth. The Da Zhang People's Commune and the Pu Kou Shi People's Commune in the county have also achieved a daily output of more than 10,000 tons of raw coal. The county's total daily raw coal output reached 50,464 tons on the 13th, ranking first in the province.

    醴陵县八里坳人民公社
    一天挖出原煤两万多吨
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省醴陵县八里坳人民公社社员，13日在牛丫洪煤矿挖出了二万零二百十五吨原煤，创造了全省人民公社原煤日产量最高纪录。
    牛丫洪煤矿煤藏丰富，有的地方挖开地面三尺就见煤；煤的质量很好，70％可以炼焦。可是在这块煤田上，过去只开了一座日产不到一百吨的小煤窑。八里坳人民公社成立后，社员们积极要求露天开采这个矿区。公社党委在10月2日组织了三千六百人的采煤大军，奋战五天五夜，在10月7日就揭开了八十亩面积的山盖子，8日就出煤五千零五十吨，在湖南全省树立起了小煤矿高额丰产红旗。接着在13日就放出了日产原煤二万零二百十五吨的“卫星”。
    现在，这个公社的社员们干劲更大。他们正在工地上加设绞车、索道、溜斗等运输工具，决心创造日产三万、五万、十万吨，甚至更高新纪录。
    在八里坳人民公社的推动下，醴陵县的煤炭生产也有了飞跃的增长。全县又有大障人民公社、普口市人民公社日产原煤达到一万吨以上。全县原煤日产量，在13日达到了五万零四百六十四吨，跃居全省第一位。
