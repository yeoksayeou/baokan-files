Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 1st: Nearly four thousand people from all walks of life in Warsaw held a grand rally at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw on the evening of September 30 to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Polish party and state leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, Jendrychowski, Loga-Sowiński, Morawski, Ochab, Zambrowski and others attended the celebration.

Wang Bingnan, the Chinese Ambassador to Poland, also attended the meeting.

Diplomatic envoys from other countries to Poland also attended the celebration.

The meeting was presided over by Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State and Chairman of the All-Poland Committee of the National Unity Front. In his opening speech, Zawadzki said that the Polish people warmly congratulate the Chinese people on the great achievements they have made in socialist construction. China has never had such a rapid rate of development as it does now in its history. At this rate of development, China will be able to surpass Britain in the output of important industrial products in less than fifteen years.

Zawadzki condemned U.S. imperialism for its military provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area and demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area.

Subsequently, Jendrychowski, member the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Poland-China Friendship Association, gave a report on the ninth anniversary of the founding of China.

Ambassador Wang Bingnan then spoke. He said that recently, the United States, ignoring our repeated serious warnings and the firm opposition of the people of the world, has persisted in military provocations and threats of war against the Chinese people, and has continued to expand its aggression against China. This is the most urgent danger in the current situation in the Taiwan Strait area, and it is also the real root cause of the tension in the area. In order to ease and eliminate the tension in the Taiwan Strait area, the United States must immediately stop its military provocations and threats of war against China, withdraw all its armed forces from the Taiwan area, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

After the meeting, a performance was held.

    萨瓦茨基在华沙集会上说
    美军必须滚出台湾去
    据新华社华沙1日电　华沙各界群众近四千人9月30日晚间在华沙文化科学宫举行盛大集会，庆祝中华人民共和国建国九周年。波兰党和国家的领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹、英德里霍夫斯基、洛加—索文斯基、莫拉夫斯基、奥哈布、萨姆布罗夫斯基等出席了庆祝大会。
    中国驻波兰大使王炳南也出席了大会。
    参加庆祝大会的还有其他国家驻波兰的外交使节。
    大会由波兰国务委员会主席、全国阵线全波委员会主席萨瓦茨基主持。萨瓦茨基在开幕词中说，波兰人民热烈祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设方面所取得的伟大成就。中国历史上从来没有过现在这样快的发展速度，在这种发展速度下，中国不需要十五年就可以在重要工业产品产量方面超过英国。
  萨瓦茨基谴责美国帝国主义在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行的军事挑衅，要求美国军队撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区。
    接着，波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、波中友协主席英德里霍夫斯基在会上作了关于中国建国九周年的报告。
    王炳南大使随后讲了话。他说，最近美国不顾我国一再提出的严重警告和世界人民的坚决反对，坚持对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，不断扩大它对中国的侵略。这是目前台湾海峡地区局势中最迫切的危险，也是这一地区局势紧张的真正根源。为了和缓和消除台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，美国必须立即停止对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁，从台湾地区撤出它的一切武装力量，停止干涉中国内政。
    会后，举行了演出。
