    Vice Chairman Song and Workers and Peasants Together
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Yang Ying and Ye Shitao
    In mid-October, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, inspected the largest cotton textile factory in Shanghai, the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, and the "July 1st" People's Commune, the first to be established in the suburbs. She greatly praised the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants. At the end of the inspection of the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, she excitedly said to the workers: With the leadership of the Party and the soaring enthusiasm of the people across the country, we not only have the confidence to build a socialist society quickly, but also the transition to a communist society is not so far away. Surpassing capitalist countries is no longer a problem. The provocations of American imperialism will only accelerate their demise!
    On the morning of October 17th, Vice Chairman Song, accompanied by Zhang Chengzong, Director of the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau, arrived at the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill. The textile workers greeted her extremely warmly.
    Vice Chairman Song was wearing an ordinary gray Lenin suit. She looked particularly energetic that day. Although she had some difficulty moving due to arthritis, she was obviously infected by the workers' great enthusiasm. She forgot her fatigue and visited several workshops in a row, and carefully looked at the workers' new creations and the big-character posters they had written. At noon, she also ate lunch with the workers in the workers' large canteen.
    Zhu Shouan, the director of the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, and Zhao Mingde, the Party Secretary, introduced the situation of the factory to Vice Chairman Song: The factory has more than 8,000 workers. In the past few years, the textile factory produced according to routine, and generally only increased production by 3% to 10% per year. This year, the workers made a big technical revolution and broke the old rules. The cotton yarn output of this factory in the third quarter increased by 33% compared with the same period last year. Next year, they will put forward the goal of doubling production. During the rectification movement, the workers posted more than 150,000 big-character posters, and put forward various criticisms and suggestions. Now the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. Half of the cadres have been sent to the countryside and workshops, and the leading cadres all work shifts. The factory director and the Party secretary spend at least one to four hours in the workshop every day. Vice Chairman Song saw a small bed next to the factory director's desk, with a bedding roll made of mats on it. People told her that this was where the factory director slept. Under the leadership of the factory director and the Party secretary, many cadres in this factory have moved to the factory and lived with the workers.
    The factory director told Vice Chairman Song that when the factory was carrying out the technical revolution, the upsurge of the cultural revolution also followed. The workers created the miracle of eliminating illiteracy in six days. An old worker named Hu Xiuying, who is over fifty years old, has no less enthusiasm for learning culture than young people. She wears her newly bought reading glasses and asks her granddaughter to help her to school to study, rain or shine. Now she can read the Labor Daily by herself. The factory has set up a Red and Expert University, with more than 5,000 people attending school. After eliminating illiteracy, after four years of study, the workers will reach the level of graduation from a textile college.
    Vice Chairman Song inquired with concern about the factory's current daily output of cotton yarn, whether it was making steel, and how the workers' cultural activities were going? Every answer made her very satisfied.
    After eating lunch in the worker's canteen, Vice Chairman Song did not rest and went to the office corridor to read the big-character posters. After the rectification, the workers have learned to use big-character posters to solve various contradictions that occur in daily production, work, and life. Some of the big-character posters on the wall criticized the slurry being too coarse, and slurry spots appeared on the yarn; some criticized someone's departmentalism; some criticized the leadership for improving a certain work too slowly... Among them, the most eye-catching was written by all the staff of the Supply and Marketing Section: Requesting the cancellation of the quarterly bonus system for the section. The big-character poster elaborated on various reasons to explain that this unreasonable bonus system hindered the unity of the staff and hindered production. Vice Chairman Song asked Wu Xiuzhen, the deputy director who accompanied her on the visit: Has the leadership accepted this opinion? Wu Xiuzhen replied: This is a proposal from some workers, and we will convene a workers' congress to discuss this matter. Vice Chairman Song nodded, agreeing with this practice of fully promoting democracy.
    The news of Vice Chairman Song's inspection of the factory spread, and the workers on the middle shift rushed to meet Vice Chairman Song, vying to shake hands and say hello to her. Surrounded by the workers, Vice Chairman Song went to visit the various workshops.
    In the spinning workshop, Vice Chairman Song saw a centrifugal spinning machine that was being produced experimentally. It uses a centrifugal can instead of the steel ring and traveler on the spinning frame, which can greatly increase the speed and make the output four times more than that of ordinary textile machines. It can also reduce the number of broken ends to a minimum.
    Vice Chairman Song specially visited the workshop of Huang Baomei, the banner of textile female workers. A mobile red flag was inserted on the car of Huang Baomei's group, which was the reward for their group reaching the highest record in the entire workshop after speeding up the car. In the past, female workers only did piecing and tending the machines. If the machines broke down, they were repaired by maintenance workers. Huang Baomei was the first to learn how to repair the machines. Female workers can tend machines and repair machines, which is another great innovation in the history of the textile industry. Recently, the factory is carrying out a campaign to learn from Huang Baomei, calling on all female workers to learn how to repair machines and become the masters of the machines. Vice Chairman Song stood beside the car for a long time, shook hands with Huang Baomei tightly, and congratulated them on their outstanding contributions to socialist construction.
    Next, Vice Chairman Song visited two cutting-edge technologies in the textile industry: jet looms and electrostatic spinning. Electrostatic spinning is a technical project that is still being researched and improved in various countries. After several months of hard work, the workers have achieved success in these projects and have caught up with and surpassed them in some aspects. Now it generally takes about 50 hours to spin cotton into yarn. Electrostatic spinning completely abolishes the opening, carding, drawing, and roving processes, and directly spins cotton into fine yarn in just two minutes. Last week, electrostatic spinning has been able to continuously produce yarn for more than two hours without breaking, and the evenness of the 40-count yarn reached the quality of first-class products.
    Along the way, Vice Chairman Song also visited the worker's health station. She was very concerned about the worker's welfare work. People told her that there are more than 5,000 female workers in this factory, and babies under fifteen months old can be accommodated in the factory's nursery. Nearly half of the factory's 8,000 workers live in public houses.
    After the inspection, Vice Chairman Song enthusiastically watched the film "Huang Baomei" which was written and performed by the workers of this factory. The protagonist of the film, Huang Baomei, sat kindly next to Vice Chairman Song, constantly introducing her to the plot of the film, which depicts the ordinary and great deeds of Huang Baomei, who has maintained the honor of National Model Worker since 1953, and her group of workers.
    Before leaving, Vice Chairman Song spoke to the staff, saying that she had learned a lot in the factory and saw the miracles created by the workers in the history of world textiles. She enthusiastically praised the workers' bold creation, saying: You are not only production experts, but also the masters of culture. You are poets and actors. Such workers are rarely seen in the world, but our workers have such spirit. She said: This proves that the working people are the smartest and most capable. Under the leadership of the Party, there is nothing that the working people cannot accomplish. She encouraged the workers to muster greater enthusiasm and create greater miracles.
    The next morning, the sun was shining brightly. Vice Chairman Song, accompanied by Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, and Ma Wanjie, Minister of the Rural Work Department, came to the "July 1st" People's Commune.
    The Party Secretary, Director, and Youth League Secretary of the commune greeted Vice Chairman Song into the commune's office. As soon as she sat down, Vice Chairman Song said to everyone that she knew that the members were very enthusiastic about production and worked very hard, so she came to see them to express her condolences and to learn from the peasants. Wan Hui, the Party Secretary of the commune, quickly thanked her. He then reported on the process of merging seventy-four advanced agricultural cooperatives to establish this commune and the current labor organization of the commune, the production enthusiasm of the members, etc. Comrade Wei Wenbo also interjected a few words to supplement from time to time. Vice Chairman Song nodded repeatedly, smiling to express her approval.
    Vice Chairman Song asked about the commune's steelmaking situation. Wan Hui said that the county party committee gave us the task of producing 400 tons of steel within the year. After the commune's party committee and the masses discussed it, they added it to 500 tons. "Can you do it?" Vice Chairman Song asked with concern. Wan Hui and other cadres of the commune answered "Yes!" Now four production brigades have started to make steel. One team has already produced steel. The members who are not skilled in the technology are learning. The masses have heard that they have contributed a lot of scrap iron to steelmaking.
    Vice Chairman Song hoped to talk about the enthusiasm of the female members, the situation of nurseries and kindergartens, and how the commune takes care of pregnant women. Shi Li, the Secretary of the Women's Committee of the Party Committee of the "July 1st" People's Commune, gave a brief introduction. She told Vice Chairman Song that the commune is close to the city, and many young men have gone to work in factories in Shanghai, so two-thirds of the labor force is women. Since the socialization of housework, the women have been very enthusiastic! Now 100% of the female members with labor are working. The phenomenon of being late and leaving early due to washing clothes and cooking is gone. Even old ladies in their sixties are asking to do something. The commune has 351 nurseries and 177 kindergartens. Almost all the children in the commune have entered nurseries and kindergartens, and mothers don’t have to worry at all. The commune takes great care of pregnant female members. The commune regulations stipulate 40 days of maternity leave, wages are paid as usual, light work is done before delivery, no long distances are traveled, and work close to home is assigned for a period of time after delivery to facilitate breastfeeding. Vice Chairman Song expressed her satisfaction after listening.
    These days, the members of the "July 1st" People's Commune are carrying out a shock fertilizer accumulation campaign. In the fields, colorful flags are flying, and male and female young peasants are nervously digging mud, weeding, and smoking soil. Piles of newly accumulated fertilizer have been piled up on the edges of the fields. Vice Chairman Song first came to the "Youth Satellite Camp." The young men jumped up from the fields as deep as the riverbeds, and there was a burst of cheers from far and near, "Hello, Vice Chairman Song!" Vice Chairman Song clapped her hands as she watched their fiery enthusiasm and said to everyone, "You have worked hard!" "Not hard!" the young people answered in unison. Wang Xunyan, the deputy instructor of the Satellite Camp, ran to Vice Chairman Song to report, representing the 118 soldiers of the entire camp to welcome the Vice Chairman, saying that their land had been deeply plowed three or five feet deep, and they were applying fertilizer in layers, preparing for wheat and rapeseed to launch big satellites next year.
    It was close to noon when visiting the cotton fields. Vice Chairman Song was very happy to see the full cotton bolls like stars and a white expanse of flowers. In the cotton fields, a group of female students from the Second Shanghai Medical College were helping the members to rush to pick cotton. Vice Chairman Song happily said to them: How about a competition? After speaking, she bent down to pick cotton. Vice Chairman Song walked through the narrow ridges, picking as she walked, very skillfully, and handed a handful of accumulated cotton to the members next to her. Soon she came to another cotton field. The cotton branches here were short and thin, and the cotton bolls were very small, completely different from the man-high cotton stalks she had just seen. Comrade Wei Wenbo and the leading cadres of the commune told Vice Chairman Song that this field was planted by a farmer who used to farm individually. This individual farmer, after repeated ideological struggles in the process of running the commune, felt that there was a future only in collective work, and also asked to join the People's Commune. Vice Chairman Song nodded in agreement after listening.
    Before eating in a peasant canteen of the 10th Production Brigade of the commune, Vice Chairman Song visited the kitchen. She praised that everything here was very clean and there were no flies. Comrade Wei Wenbo said that the peasants here are doing a good job in eliminating the four pests and have become a "seven-free village." After lunch, Vice Chairman Song, regardless of rest, enthusiastically visited the commune's nurseries, kindergartens, and health stations. The younger children were taking a nap. Vice Chairman Song walked gently into the children's dormitory and stood by the bed for a while. In the kindergarten, the educators led a group of children to perform songs and play games for Vice Chairman Song. Vice Chairman Song was amused by the children's innocent and lively expressions, clapping constantly, and inquiring about the children's living conditions with concern.
    That day, Vice Chairman Song also went to see the mature single-season late rice and the commune's experimental fields of Huang Ya Cai and autumn tomatoes. The members picked a few golden rice ears and gave them to her. Vice Chairman Song asked how many grains were in each ear. The members replied that there were about 150 grains, which was not considered good. The rice in some high-yield fields had more than 200 grains in each ear.
    At two o'clock in the afternoon, Vice Chairman Song was about to go back. On the edge of the field, she said to the leading cadres and members of the commune: "Although I only saw a part of the commune today, I have already seen the superiority of the People's Commune, and saw the sprouts of communism. It can be seen that under the leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm and wisdom of the peasants are endless." She encouraged the members of the commune to "muster greater enthusiasm, engage in large-scale production, engage in large-scale cultural revolution, completely eliminate the four pests, and strive to achieve free food and clothing as soon as possible, so that communism will come soon." Although there were not many words, it was a great political encouragement for the members of the "July 1st" People's Commune. The Party Secretary and the Director were busy answering that they must tell every member about Vice Chairman Song's instructions, and use production results to thank Vice Chairman Song for her concern, and strive for a bumper harvest and launch big satellites next year, and go to Beijing to report the good news.

    宋副委员长和工人农民在一起
    新华社记者  杨瑛  叶世涛
    10月中旬，全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长，视察了上海最大的棉纺织厂——国棉十七厂和郊区第一个成立的“七一”人民公社。她对工人农民们的冲天干劲倍加赞扬。在国棉十七厂视察结束的时候，她兴奋地对工人们说：有了党的领导，有了全国人民的冲天干劲，我们不但有信心很快建成社会主义社会，而且过渡到共产主义社会，也不是多么遥远的事情了；超过资本主义国家早已不成问题了。美帝国主义向我们挑衅，也只有加快他们的灭亡！
    10月17日上午，宋副委员长由上海市纺织工业局局长张承宗同志陪同，来到国棉十七厂。纺织工人极其热烈地接待了她。
    宋副委员长穿着一身普通的灰布列宁装。这天精神显得特别好。她虽然因患关节炎行动有些不便，但显然为工人们的巨大干劲所感染，她忘记了劳累，一连参观了好几个车间，还仔细地看了工人们的新创造和他们写的大字报。中午，她又在工人的大食堂里和工人们一起吃了中饭。
    国棉十七厂的厂长朱寿安、党委书记赵明德向宋副委员长介绍了厂里的情况：全厂有八千多工人。几年来纺织工厂按常规生产，一般每年只能增产3％到10％。今年工人们大闹技术革命，打破陈规，这个厂第三季度棉纱产量比去年同期增加了33％，明年，他们将要提出生产翻一番的奋斗目标。整风运动中，工人们贴出了十五万多张大字报，提出了各种批评和建议。现在干部和群众的关系有了很大改善。干部有一半已下放到农村和车间去，领导干部都跟班劳动，厂长和党委书记等每天至少有一小时到四小时在车间里。宋副委员长看到厂长办公桌旁边，放着一张小床，上面有一个用席子卷的铺盖卷。人们告诉她这就是厂长睡的地方。这个厂的很多干部在厂长、党委书记带头之下，都已搬到工厂，和工人们住在一起。
    厂长告诉宋副委员长，这个厂在进行技术革命的时候，文化革命的高潮也随着到来了。工人们创造了六天消灭文盲的奇迹。有一个老工人叫胡秀英，五十多岁了，但是她学文化的干劲一点儿也不比年轻人差，她戴起新买的老光眼镜，风雨无阻，叫孙女搀扶她到校里学习。现在已经自己能看劳动报了。厂里办起了红专大学，上学的有五千多人。扫盲以后，读四年功夫，工人们就将达到纺织专科学校毕业的水平。
    宋副委员长关切地询问了厂里目前每天的棉纱产量，炼不炼钢，工人们的文艺活动进行得怎样？每一个回答都使她十分满意。
    在工人食堂吃罢中饭，宋副委员长没有休息又到办公室走廊看大字报。整风以后，工人们已经学会运用大字报来解决日常生产、工作、生活中发生的各种矛盾。墙上的大字报，有的批评浆糟太粗，纱上出现浆斑了；有的是批评某人的本位主义的；有的批评领导对某一项工作改进得太慢……。其中最引人注目的是一张供销科全体人员写的：要求取消科室季度奖励制，大字报阐述了各种理由说明这个不合理的奖励制度妨碍了职工内部的团结，妨碍了生产。宋副委员长问陪她参观的副厂长吴秀珍：领导上接受了这个意见没有？吴秀珍回答说：这是一部分工人的提议，我们就要召开工人代表大会讨论这件事。宋副委员长点点头，赞同这样充分发扬民主的做法。
    宋副委员长到工厂视察的消息传开了，上中班的工人纷纷跑来和宋副委员长见面，抢着和她握手问好。在工人们簇拥下，宋副委员长到各个车间去参观。
    在细纱车间，宋副委员长看到了正在作试验性生产的离心式纺纱机。它用离心罐代替了精纺机上的钢丝圈和钢领圈可以大大加快车速，使产量比一般纺织机多四倍。还能把断头降低到最少程度。
    宋副委员长特地访问了纺织女工的旗帜黄宝妹的车间，在黄宝妹小组的车子上，插着一面流动红旗，这是她们小组在加快车速以后，产量达到全车间最高纪录的奖赏。历来女工只做接头、挡车，车子坏了，由保全工修理，黄宝妹首先学会了修理车子。女工会挡车，又会修车，这个又是纺织工业史上一大创举。最近厂里正在开展一个学习黄宝妹运动，号召所有女工学会修理机器，做机器的主人。宋副委员长在车旁伫立良久，和黄宝妹紧紧地握手，祝贺她们为社会主义建设所作出的卓越贡献。
    接着宋副委员长又参观了两项纺织工业上的尖端技术：喷气式无梭织机和静电纺纱。静电纺纱是世界各国尚在进行研究与改进的技术项目，工人们经过几个月的苦战，已经在这些项目上取得了成就，并在某些方面赶上与超过了他们。现在一般把棉花纺成纱要五十小时左右，静电纺纱根本废除了清花、钢丝车、条子、粗纺等工序，把棉花直接纺成细纱，只要两分钟。上星期静电纺纱已能连续出纱两小时多不断头，纺出来的四十支纱条干的均匀度也达到一级品的质量。
    沿路，宋副委员长还参观了工人保健站，她非常关心工人的福利工作。人们告诉她这个厂有五千多女工，十五个月以前的婴儿都能收托在工厂的托儿所里。全厂八千多工人，有将近一半是住在公家的房子里。
    视察完了以后，宋副委员长兴致勃勃地又看了这个厂的工人们自己编、自己演的影片“黄宝妹”。影片的主角黄宝妹，亲切地坐在宋副委员长身旁，不断地向她介绍影片中的情节，这是描绘从1953年起就一直保持着全国劳动模范荣誉的黄宝妹和她的小组工人们的平凡而又伟大的事迹。
    临别时，宋副委员长向职工们讲了话，她说在厂里学到了很多东西，看到了工人们在世界纺织史上创造的奇迹。她热情地歌颂了工人的大胆创造，她说：你们不但是生产能手，又是文化的主人，你们是诗人，是演员，这样的工人在世界上还很少见，而我们的工人就有这样的气概。她说：这证明劳动人民最聪明，最能干，劳动人民在党的领导下，没有完成不了的事情。她鼓励工人们鼓起更大的干劲，创造更大的奇迹。
    次日清晨，阳光明媚。宋副委员长在中共上海市委书记处书记魏文伯同志和农村工作部部长马万杰同志的陪同下来到“七一”人民公社。
    公社的党委书记、社长、团委书记等把宋副委员长迎进了公社的办公室。刚刚坐下，宋副委员长便对大家说，知道社员们生产干劲很大，很辛苦，特地跑来看看，一则表示慰问，再则是向农民们学习。公社党委书记万辉连忙道谢。他随即汇报了七十四个高级农业社合并成立这个公社的经过和目前公社的劳动组织，社员的生产热情等等。魏文伯同志也不时插上几句补充。宋副委员长连连点头，微笑着表示赞许。
    宋副委员长问起公社炼钢的情形。万辉说，这里县委给我们的任务是年内炼钢四百吨，公社党委和群众一讨论，加到五百吨。“做得到做不到？”宋副委员长关心地问。万辉和公社的其他干部都答“能！”现在有四个生产大队已经着手炼了，其中有一队并已炼出钢来，社员技术不熟练的正在学习，群众听说炼钢献出了不少废铁。
    宋副委员长希望谈谈女社员的干劲，托儿所、幼儿园的情况和公社对怀孕妇女怎样照顾。“七一”人民公社党委的妇女委员会书记石丽作了简单的介绍。她告诉宋副委员长，公社靠近城市，很多男青年到上海工厂做工去了，因此三分之二的劳动力是妇女，自从家务劳动社会化以后，妇女们的干劲可足啦！现在有劳动力的女社员百分之百出工，过去那种因为洗衣煮饭而迟到早退的现象已经没有了，就是六十多岁的老太太也要求出来做点事情。公社现有三百五十一个托儿所和一百七十七个幼儿园，几乎全社孩子都进了托儿所和幼儿园，母亲们根本就不用挂心。公社对怀孕女社员非常照顾，社章规定产假四十天，工资照发，产前做轻活，不跑远路，产后一个时期也分配做路近的工作，便于她们给婴儿喂奶。宋副委员长听了表示满意。
    这几天“七一”人民公社的社员们正在开展突击积肥运动。田野里，彩旗飘飘，男女农民青年正在紧张地挖泥、锄草、熏土，一堆堆新积的肥料已经堆在田头地边。宋副委员长首先来到“青年卫星营”。小伙子们从深得像片河床的田地里跳起来，远远近近顿时一片欢呼声，“宋副委员长好！”宋副委员长瞧着他们这股火热劲头也鼓起掌来，向大家说“你们辛苦了”“不辛苦！”青年们一齐回答。卫星营的副教导员王逊言跑到宋副委员长跟前报告，代表全营一百一十八个战士欢迎副委员长，说他们的土地已经深翻了三尺、五尺，正在分层施肥，准备明年的小麦、油菜都放大卫星。
    参观棉田的时候已经接近中午了。宋副委员长看到像繁星似的饱满的棉桃和一片雪白的花朵，十分高兴。棉田里，一批上海第二医学院的女学生正在帮助社员抢摘棉花。宋副委员长愉快地对她们说：一起来个比赛好吗？说完就弯下身去采摘棉花。宋副委员长穿过狭狭的田埂，边走边采，动作很熟练，手里积满一把便交给身旁的社员。不久来到另一块棉田，这里的棉枝又矮又细，棉铃也小得很，跟方才看到的人般高的棉秆全不一样。魏文伯同志和公社的领导干部告诉宋副委员长，这块田是过去一个单干农民种的。这个单干农民在办公社的过程中经过反复的思想斗争，觉得只有走向集体才有前途，也要求加入人民公社。宋副委员长听后点头称是。
    宋副委员长在公社第十生产大队一个农民食堂吃饭以前参观了厨房。她称赞这里的一切都很清洁，没有苍蝇。魏文伯同志说，这里的农民们除四害很好，已经成为“七无村”了。吃过午饭，宋副委员长顾不上休息又兴致冲冲地去访问公社的托儿所、幼儿园和保健站。年龄小一点的孩子正在午睡，宋副委员长轻轻地走进孩子们的寝室，在床边站了片刻。在幼儿园，教养员带着一群孩子给宋副委员长表演唱歌、做游戏。宋副委员长被孩子们天真活泼的神情逗笑了，不断鼓掌，并且关心地询问孩子们的生活情况。
    这天，宋副委员长还去看了成熟的单季晚稻和公社的黄芽菜、秋蕃茄试验田。社员们摘下几枝金黄色的稻穗送给她。宋副委员长问每穗有多少谷粒，社员回答说，大约一百五十粒光景，这还不算是好的，有几亩丰产田的稻子，其中最多的每穗有二百多粒。
  下午二点钟，宋副委员长要回去了。在田头边，她对公社的领导干部和社员们说：“今天虽然只看了公社的一部分，但已经看到人民公社的优越性，看到了共产主义的萌芽，看得出来，在党的领导下，农民的干劲和智慧是无穷无尽的。”她勉励公社的社员们“鼓起更大干劲，大搞生产，大搞文化革命，彻底消除四害，争取尽快做到吃饭穿衣不要钱，让共产主义早日到来。”话虽然不多，对于“七一”人民公社的社员们却是一个很大的政治鼓舞。党委书记和社长忙着回答，一定要把宋副委员长的指示告诉每个社员，用生产成绩来答谢宋副委员长的关怀，争取明年大丰收，大放卫星，到北京去报喜。
