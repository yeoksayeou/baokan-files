Introducing Four Potato Diggers

    (I)
    The entire staff of the Tiemu Factory in Xijiuji Township, Hejian County, Hebei Province, after three days and nights of hard work, manufactured a horse-drawn potato digger (see Figure 1). Its structure consists of: the iron frame of a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, two plow depths, supporting a large moldboard, installed on the body of the double-wheeled double-furrow plow, and can be operated by two people and two animals. After testing, it can dig twenty mu per day, saving fifty laborers. This potato digger was demonstrated on-site with good results, and has five advantages: First, because it is modified from a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, it can still cultivate the land when not digging sweet potatoes; second, it does not drop any pieces or damage the sweet potato skin when digging sweet potatoes; third, it is relatively economical, costing only ten yuan to modify one; fourth, it can loosen the soil to a depth of seven to eight inches when digging potatoes, equivalent to a deep plowing; fifth, it is easy to use, labor-saving, and can also dig peanuts.

    (II)
    The Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently modified a double-wheeled double-furrow plow into a sweet potato digger (see Figure 2), which has been proven effective in trials at the Hongqi People's Commune in Changping District, Beijing. The sweet potato digger can dig twelve to thirteen mu of sweet potatoes per day with two oxen pulling and one person steering, increasing efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual digging.
    The modification method is very simple: remove the two plowshares and install a sweet potato digging shovel. The tip of the shovel is shield-shaped, bulging in the middle, and its function is to loosen the soil and lift the sweet potatoes. A fixed plate is installed under the plow beam, and four twelve-millimeter thick iron bars are fixed on the plate, extending upwards at an angle. The function of the iron bars is to screen out the soil from the sweet potatoes dug up by the front shovel tip and push them to the ground.
    It only costs seven or eight yuan to modify a sweet potato digger.

    (III)
    This year, Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, has a large planting area and high yield of yams. In order to save labor and improve the efficiency and quality of yam harvesting, and to ensure a bumper harvest, the prefecture has decided to promote the use of animal-powered yam diggers (from Cang County, Hebei Province) and yam diggers modified from double-furrow plows.
    The yam digger modified from a double-furrow plow (see Figure 4) was successfully trial-produced by workers from the Tiemu Agricultural Implement Factory in Hanwang Township People's Commune, Tongshan County, after learning from foreign experience. They removed the front and rear plowshares, front beam, tail wheel, and other parts of the double-furrow plow, and installed the shovel head, iron rods, shovel frame, etc. of the yam digger. After testing, it has three major advantages: (1) High efficiency: it can dig fifteen to twenty mu per day with two oxen pulling; (2) Good digging quality: it does not damage the yams; (3) Easy to modify: when not in use, the original plowshares can be reinstalled to till the land.

    (IV)
    Lu Shuchun, director of the workshop at the Bengbu Prefecture Agricultural Implement Trial Factory in Anhui, created a yam-lifting and soil-loosening machine, which has been proven effective through several trials. Recently, Bengbu Prefecture decided to promote 22,000 yam-lifting and soil-loosening machines in various counties to speed up the yam harvest.
    The yam-lifting and soil-loosening machine has a simple structure (see Figure 3). The main components are three rollers, three plows (the plows on both sides only have plowshares, without shovel tips; the middle plow has a shovel tip, without a plowshare), and an operating lever. When harvesting yams, the machine can be driven by oxen or ropes, and can harvest more than twenty mu of yams per day, increasing work efficiency by twenty times compared to digging with shovels or grab hooks; the plows on both sides of this yam-lifting and soil-loosening machine do not have shovel tips, which allows for fast plowing without damaging the yams; moreover, it cultivates evenly, and after harvesting the yams, it can still achieve the purpose of loosening the soil, tilling the land, and deep plowing.

    介绍四种刨薯机
    （一）
    河北省河间县西九吉乡铁木工厂全体职工，经过三昼夜的苦战，制成马拉刨薯机（见图一）。其构造是：双轮双铧犁的铁架、两个犁深，托住一个大铧，安在双轮双铧犁的身上，两个人和两个牲口就可操作。经试验，一天能刨二十亩，可节省五十个劳力。这个刨薯机曾进行了现场表演，效果良好，优点有五条：一、由于是用双轮双铧犁改制，不刨甘薯时还可耕地；二、刨甘薯时不掉零块，损坏不了薯皮；三、比较经济，十块钱就可改制一个；四、刨薯时能疏松土壤七至八寸深，顶一次深耕；五、使用时轻便、省力，还能刨花生。
    （二）
    中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所农机室，最近用双轮双铧犁改装成白薯挖掘机（见图二），经在北京市郊昌平区红旗人民公社试验证明，效果很好。白薯挖掘机用两个牛拉一个人扶每天可挖白薯十二亩到十三亩，比人力挖掘提高效率十几倍。
    改装方法很简单，把两个犁头卸下来，装上白薯挖掘机铲。铲尖是盾形，中间鼓起，它的作用是把土壤弄松，把白薯抬起。在犁柱下面装一个固定板，板上固定四根十二公厘粗的铁条四根，铁条斜伸上去。铁条的作用是把前面铲尖挖起的白薯筛掉土，推到地面上来。
    改装一部白薯挖掘机，只需七、八元。
    （三）
    江苏徐州专区今年山芋种植面积大、产量高。为了节省劳动力，提高山芋的收刨效率和质量，保证丰产丰收，这个专区已决定推广使用畜力刨芋机（是河北省沧县的）和双铧犁改制的刨芋机。
    双铧犁改制的刨芋机（见图四），是铜山县汉王乡人民公社铁木业农具厂工人，学习外地经验试制成功的。他们把双铧犁的前后犁铧及前铧辕、尾轮等零件卸下，装上刨芋机的铲头、铁棍、铲架等即成。经过试验，有三大优点：（一）效率较高，两头牛牵引，一天可刨十五到二十亩；（二）刨的质量好，不伤山芋；（三）改装容易，不用时，再装上原来的犁头，仍能耕地。
    （四）
    安徽蚌埠专区农具试制厂车间主任路树春，创造了一部起芋松土机，经过数次试验，证明效果良好。最近，蚌埠专区各县决定推广两万两千部起芋松土机，加快山芋收获进度。
    起芋松土机构造简单（见图三），主要部件是三个滚轮，三个犁（两旁的犁只有犁面，没有铲头；中间的犁的铲头，没有犁面），一个操纵杆。收获山芋时，用牛或用绳索牵引机，都可带动它，每天可收获山芋二十多亩，比用铁锹挖、抓钩刨要提高工效二十倍；这种起芋松土机两旁的犁没有铲头，翻土快，还不伤山芋；而且耕的平，收过山芋之后，还能达到松土、整地和深耕的目的。（附图片）
