    Eliminate the Three Categories of Wheat Before Sowing
    Henan Improves the Quality of Late-Season Wheat Sowing
    (Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 21st) This year, Henan Province plans to expand the wheat sowing area from 70 million mu last year to 80 million mu without reducing the area of cotton and oil crops. Currently, more than 40 million mu have been sown, and it is expected to be completed around the 25th. In order to ensure the completion of the sowing plan, the late-season wheat in the province will be greatly increased this year, estimated to be around 20 million mu. How to improve the sowing quality of late-season wheat and ensure a bumper harvest of both early-season and late-season wheat next year is an important condition for ensuring the realization of a thousand jin per mu in Henan Province next year.
    To this end, the reporter recently interviewed the person in charge of the agricultural department of Henan Province on issues related to ensuring high yields of late-season wheat. The person in charge of the agricultural department first outlined to the reporter the general situation of late-season wheat production in Henan Province in the past. He said: In the past, farmers in Henan Province generally had the habit of planting late-season wheat. However, in the past, cultivation was rough, and most people neither plowed nor applied base fertilizer, but hastily sowed the seeds. According to inspections, most of the more than 10 million mu of third-class wheat in the province this spring are late-season wheat. Although the growth of these third-class wheat fields has greatly changed and the yield has been greatly improved compared with previous years after careful management in the later stage, if the sowing is meticulous and the inherent conditions are sufficient, the harvest will definitely be much higher than the actual yield this year. Therefore, how to take effective measures to improve the sowing quality of late-season wheat and ensure that the third category of wheat is eliminated before sowing is a decisive measure to ensure the realization of a thousand jin per mu in Henan Province next year.
    The person in charge said: The reasons hindering the improvement of the sowing quality of late-season wheat, in addition to objective factors such as late stubble removal and late sowing, are more importantly people's prejudice against late-season wheat. They believe that late-season wheat is sown late, has a short growing period, and the yield is destined not to increase, thus ignoring the sowing work of late-season wheat. In fact, there have been countless examples in this year's large-scale wheat harvest in the province, which fully shows that as long as it is carefully planted and cultivated well, late-season wheat can also greatly increase production. For example, the 2.9 mu of late-season wheat after radish stubble in the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, during the production process, grasped the measures of deep plowing the land, applying sufficient base fertilizer, increasing the sowing amount, and achieving close planting with full seedlings and phased irrigation and topdressing, and achieved a high yield of an average of 3,821 jin per mu this year. The Hubin Commune in Shanxian County planted 156.5 mu of wheat after cotton last year. The average yield per mu this year exceeded the average yield per mu of wheat in the province by more than double, an increase of more than 350% compared with the general yield of late-season wheat in previous years.
    How to improve sowing quality and ensure a general increase in the yield of late-season wheat? The person in charge emphasized that, according to the current situation, the following two aspects of measures must be taken: First, we must adhere to the implementation of putting politics in command and widely carry out the great debate on "Can late-season wheat increase production, and how can we ensure that late-season wheat increases production?" Through debate, we must greatly break down conservatism and break the old rules in production. At present, many areas have loudly put forward the action slogan of "We must plant and cultivate every piece of wheat carefully and ensure that the third category of wheat is eliminated before sowing" through debate, which has greatly enhanced the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in strengthening the sowing work of late-season wheat. This is an important condition for ensuring the improvement of the sowing quality of late-season wheat. Second, we must conscientiously implement the yield-increasing measures centered on water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and close planting, and truly ensure that the later the sowing, the more serious and meticulous the sowing should be. 1. Select and replace spring and semi-spring varieties suitable for late sowing, such as Baiyupi, Nanda "2419", and Bima No. 1, among which Nanda "2419" and Baiyupi are suitable for sowing after the Frost's Descent to before the Beginning of Winter. 2. Since the weather is cold when late-season wheat is sown, there are generally fewer tillers. In order to ensure that there are enough ears per mu, the sowing amount should be larger than that of ordinary wheat fields, and the sowing amount should be more than 35 jin. 3. Conscientiously deep plow the land, and after plowing, harrow it carefully and many times to break and compact the soil. If it is sandy soil, it is best to carry out pre-sowing compaction to facilitate the growth of seedlings. 4. This year, the general wheat fields in the province require more than 50,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu, and the amount of base fertilizer for late-season wheat should be even greater. 100,000 to 150,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu should be applied, and 40 to 50 jin of granular fertilizer made of calcium superphosphate should be used. When sowing, 10 to 15 jin of ammonium sulfate should be mixed with seeds per mu as seed fertilizer so that seedlings can get sufficient nutrients. In addition, we must also conscientiously strengthen field management. As long as we can plant well and manage well, the yield of late-season wheat will definitely soar together with the wheat sown in a timely manner.
    At present, the sowing work of wheat is very urgent, and the labor force in various places also feels very tight. However, as long as we conscientiously strengthen leadership and fully mobilize the masses, we will definitely be able to plant late-season wheat well.

### 把三类麦消灭在播种以前  河南提高晚茬麦播种质量

    把三类麦消灭在播种以前
    河南提高晚茬麦播种质量
    本报郑州21日电　今年河南省计划在不缩小棉花和油料面积的情况下，把小麦播种亩数由去年的七千万亩扩大到八千万亩。目前已播四千多万亩，预计25日前后即可种完。为保证完成播种计划，今年全省的晚茬小麦将大大增加，估计将在二千万亩左右。如何提高晚茬小麦的播种质量，保证明年早茬、晚茬小麦块块丰收，是保证实现明年小麦千斤省的重要条件。
    为此，记者最近就如何保证晚茬小麦丰产等有关问题，访问了河南省农业部门的负责人。农业部门负责人首先向记者概述了过去河南省晚茬小麦生产的一般情况。他说：过去河南省农民一般是有种晚茬麦习惯的。但过去耕作粗放，多半既不翻耕，又不施底肥，便草草下种。根据检查，今年春季全省的一千多万亩三类麦，其中绝大部分都是晚茬麦。这些三类麦田，经过后期认真加强管理，生长情况虽有很大改变，产量也较往年有很大提高，但是，如果播种细致，先天足，收获肯定会远比今年的实际产量高。因此，如何采取有效措施提高晚茬麦的播种质量，保证把第三类麦消灭在播种前，是确保实现明年小麦千斤省的一项带有决定性的措施。
    负责人说：障碍提高晚茬小麦播种质量的原因，除了腾茬晚、播种迟等客观因素以外，更重要的是人们对于晚茬麦存在偏见，认为晚茬小麦播种晚，生长期较短，产量注定不能提高，因而忽视晚茬小麦的播种工作。实际上，在今年全省小麦大面积丰收中已有无数的事例，充分说明了只要认真地种细种好，晚茬小麦同样可以大大增产的。比如遂平县卫星人民公社的二亩九分萝卜茬晚小麦，在生产过程中抓住了深翻土地、施足底肥、加大播种量，并做到密植全苗和分期灌溉、追肥等措施，今年获得了平均亩产三千八百二十一斤的高额丰产。陕县湖滨社，去年种棉花茬小麦一百五十六点五亩，今年平均亩产量超过全省小麦平均亩产一倍以上，比往年一般晚茬小麦产量增长350％多。
    怎样提高播种质量，确保晚茬小麦普遍增产？负责人强调指出：根据目前情况，必须采取以下两方面的措施：首先是要坚持贯彻执行政治挂帅，广泛开展“晚茬小麦能不能增产，和怎样才能保证晚茬麦增产”的大辩论，通过辩论，大破保守主义，破除生产上的陈规。目前不少地区通过辩论，响亮地提出了“要把块块小麦种细种好，保证第三类麦消灭在播种以前”的行动口号，大大提高了广大农民加强晚茬小麦播种工作的信心，这是保证提高晚茬小麦播种质量的重要条件。其次，认真贯彻执行以水、肥、土、种子与密植为中心的增产措施，切实做到播种的越晚，播的应该越认真，越细致。一、选换适宜晚播的春性和半春性品种如白玉皮、南大“二四一九”、碧蚂一号等，其中南大“二四一九”和白玉皮都以在霜降后到立冬以前播种为适宜。二、由于晚茬小麦播种时天气寒冷，一般分蘖较少，为保证每亩有足够的穗头，播种量要比一般麦田更大，下种量应在三十五斤以上。三、认真深翻土地，翻后要细耙多耙，把土壤耙碎耙实，如是沙性土壤，最好能进行播前镇压，以利幼苗生长。四、今年全省一般麦田要求每亩施底肥五万斤以上，晚茬小麦的底肥量应该更大。每亩应施底肥十万至十五万斤，和用过磷酸钙制成的颗粒肥料四十至五十斤。播种时，每亩再用硫酸铵十至十五斤拌种，作为种肥，使幼苗能够得到充足的养料。此外，还要认真加强田间管理。只要能种好和管理好，晚茬小麦的产量一定能够和适时播种的小麦一样比翼高飞。
    目前，小麦的播种工作虽然十分紧迫，各地劳动力也都感到十分紧张。但是只要认真加强领导，充分发动群众，是一定能够把晚茬小麦种好的。
