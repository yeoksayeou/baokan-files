    Sichuan Increases Coal Production with a Clever Method:
    Large Mines Run Small Pits
    (Report from this newspaper) In September, the major coal mines of Sichuan Province launched a fervent campaign to establish small coal pits. The provincial mines of Zengjiashan, Yongchuan, Weiyuan, and Jiayang, along with the Nanton, Tianfu, and Donglin mines under the Chongqing Coal Mining Bureau, alone opened ninety small coal pits, which are expected to increase coal production by more than 500,000 tons this year.
    These large mines adopted three methods for running small coal pits: (1) Organizing their own employees to run them independently. For example, Weiyuan Coal Mine plans to open eleven small pits, two of which are already in production. (2) Jointly operate with local People's Communes, with the mines responsible for providing technical guidance and simple small-scale equipment. Tianfu Coal Mine jointly operated four with People's Communes, and Zengjiashan Mine jointly operated seven, with the labor force entirely provided by the People's Communes. (3) The mines organized their own forces, under the leadership of the local Party committee, to develop small pits in areas outside their own mining areas. Jiayang Coal Mine, for instance, sent people to Emei County to open small pits.
    Large mines running small pits has opened up a new avenue for increasing production in large mines. The Dayanwan small pit run by Tianfu Mine has a daily output of 1,000 tons. The Yutangjiao small pit of Nanton Mine will produce 100,000 tons of coal this year. On September 29, Nanton Mine released a high-yield "satellite" of 6,627 tons per day, of which more than 800 tons were produced by small pits.

    四川增产煤炭有妙法
    大矿办小窑
    本报讯　四川省各大型煤矿在9月份掀起了大办小煤窑的热潮。仅省属曾家山、永川、威远、嘉阳四个矿和重庆煤矿管理局所属的南桐、天府、东林三个矿就开办小煤窑九十个，今年可增产五十多万吨煤。
    这些大矿开办小煤窑采取了三种方式：（1）组织本矿职工自办。如威远煤矿计划开办十一个小窑，目前已有两个投入生产。（2）同当地人民公社合办，由矿上负责进行技术指导，提供简单的小型设备器材。天府煤矿同人民公社合办了四个，曾家山矿同人民公社合办了七个，劳动力完全由人民公社解决。（3）由各矿组织力量，在当地党委的领导下，到本矿区以外的地区开发小窑。嘉阳煤矿就派人到峨嵋县开办小窑。
    大矿办小窑，为大矿增产开辟了新的途径。天府矿开办的大岩湾一个小窑，日产量即达一千吨。南桐矿的鱼塘角小窑，今年就能产煤十万吨；9月29日，南桐矿放出了日产六千六百二十七吨的高产卫星，其中有八百多吨是小窑生产的。
