Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a banquet this evening to bid farewell to the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation headed by Comrade Chereednichenko.

Liao Chengzhi, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Comrade Chereednichenko, head of the delegation, and Zhang Xiruo, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered speeches successively at the banquet, which was filled with a friendly atmosphere. They unanimously warmly congratulated the continuous development of the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and congratulated the further consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

In his speech, Liao Chengzhi expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the distinguished guests for their kind concern for the construction achievements of our people. Liao Chengzhi said that the achievements of our people were obtained with the multifaceted and fraternal assistance of brotherly countries, especially the Soviet Union. The achievements of our people, like the achievements of the people of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, are victories of the October Revolution, victories of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and victories of our common cause.

Liao Chengzhi also said that now is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Imperialism is following the path of "self-destruction for evil deeds," and their lifespan will not be long. The people of the world will surely achieve victory. All of this depends on the unity of the people of the world, first and foremost the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union. Liao Chengzhi also expressed that the full support given by the Soviet people when the Chinese people were bullied by US imperialism is forever engraved in his heart.

In his speech, the head of the delegation, Comrade Chereednichenko, said that during the visit, we saw that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the entire Chinese people were full of soaring enthusiasm in order to complete the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, and for the future of China and the happiness of the people. During these days, we also personally felt the fraternal friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet people, and we also saw the determination of the Chinese people to fight back against US imperialist aggression and their will to defend peace. All of this left us with unforgettable impressions. Comrade Chereednichenko also said that the entire Soviet people are extremely angry about US imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, and the entire Soviet people warmly support Khrushchev's warning to US imperialism.

Shao Lizi, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Directors Zhang Zhizhong, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyou, Xu Deheng, Liu Qingyang, etc., Zhang Xiruo, Wu Han, Lao She, Cao Jinghua, Liao Mosha, Wang Zhixiang, Vice Presidents of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc., also constantly raised their glasses at the banquet to congratulate the eternal and evergreen fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.
