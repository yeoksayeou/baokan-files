    “Not doing” and “doing”
  　Ge Guangcong
    "One must refrain from doing some things in order to be able to do other things." This is an ancient Chinese saying, but it reflects a dialectical relationship between things. Applying it to our country's socialist construction today still has practical significance.
    The enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee determined the principle that industrial production and construction must first guarantee key projects. The focus of our country's industrial production and construction is iron and steel and machinery, and iron and steel is the most important of all. Therefore, in order to ensure that we can produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, in order to achieve something in this key area of steel, we must refrain from doing some things in other projects. Among the series of measures taken by the CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee to ensure the completion of this year's steel production plan, the first is to mobilize the province's machinery manufacturing force to manufacture metallurgical equipment, calling for "all machinery manufacturing to give way to metallurgical machinery." Except for what is urgently needed, a blanket cut is adopted, all production is stopped, and all possible forces are concentrated to manufacture metallurgical equipment. The CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee conducted a comprehensive review of the 922 capital construction projects currently under construction, dividing them into three categories. The first category is the main key projects that must be guaranteed; the second category is other key projects that we strive to guarantee and a number of finishing projects that do not require much materials; the third category is general projects, which will be stopped to give way to key projects, especially steel construction projects, when they conflict, reducing the scale, slowing down the speed, or postponing construction. The Dalian General Machinery Factory and the Dalian Machinery Manufacturing Factory unloaded the parts they were cutting from the machine tools and replaced them with parts for metallurgical equipment from the Dalian Mining Vehicles Factory in order to support the Dalian Mining Vehicles Factory's task of manufacturing metallurgical equipment. ... This practice of making all machinery manufacturing give way to metallurgical machinery, this practice of stopping all general projects to give way when they conflict with key projects, this practice of putting aside secondary tasks to concentrate on metallurgical equipment, is a manifestation of being able to "do" only after having "not done".
    "Not doing" and "doing" are a unity of opposites. Our "not doing" is not a passive "not doing." Its purpose is to "do," and to "do" great things. In a certain period, we can only grasp a few main things. When the main things are grasped, we can put down some secondary things when the strength is insufficient. This kind of "not doing" is absolutely necessary. Because, first, it provides a strong guarantee for the most urgent things that should be given priority to development; second, it seems that it has delayed the development speed or reduced the development scale of some secondary production and construction projects, but in fact, it has created conditions for its future great development. In our country's industrial production and construction, if we do not first guarantee the development of the iron and steel and machinery industries, then the development of other aspects will be very difficult or even impossible. Only by first concentrating our efforts to ensure the development of the production of iron and steel and machinery can these two "marshals" in turn support and guarantee the rapid development of other industries. Therefore, the result of "not doing" is, in the final analysis, not delaying but accelerating the development speed of various production and construction undertakings, not reducing but expanding the development scale of various production and construction undertakings. In a word, only by "not doing" can we "do," and only then can we "do" great things.
    Of course, "not doing" in order to concentrate efforts on developing steel production does not mean stopping all other production and having everyone single-mindedly engage in steel production. Rather, it means putting steel production and construction in the primary position. When the development of the steel industry conflicts with the development of other industries, other industries should give way to the steel industry first. Things themselves exist and develop in a contradictory and unified way, and it is not possible to seek only unity while denying the existence of contradiction. As long as everyone can proceed from the overall perspective of first focusing on steel, it will not be difficult to distinguish between priorities and determine what is primary, so that they can "do" some things while "not doing" others.

    “不为”和“为”
  　戈广从
    “要有所不为，而后才能有所为。”这是我国的一句古话，但它反映的却是事物间的一种辩证关系，用之于今天我们国家的社会主义建设，也还是有现实意义的。
    中共中央政治局扩大会议确定了工业的生产和建设必须首先保证重点的方针，我国工业生产和建设的重点是钢铁和机械，而钢铁又是重点中的重点。因此，为了保证今年能产钢一千零七十万吨，为了在钢铁这个重点上有所为，我们就不能不在其他某些项目方面有所不为。中共江西省委为了保证完成今年的产钢计划所采取的一系列措施中，第一项就是动员全省机械制造力量制造冶金设备，叫“一切机械制造给冶金机械让路”，除了急需的以外，采取一刀砍的办法，全部停止生产，集中一切可能集中的力量制造冶金设备。中共天津市委和天津市人民委员会把目前已经动工的九百二十二个基建项目进行了全面排队，把它们分成三类，第一类是必须保证的主要重点项目；第二类是争取保证的其他重点项目以及一批需料不多的收尾工程；第三类是一般工程，当它们与重点工程、特别是与钢铁建设项目有矛盾时，一律停车让路，紧缩规模，放缓速度或暂缓施工。大连通用机器厂和大连机械制造厂为了支援大连工矿车辆厂制造冶金设备的任务，把自己正在切削的部件从机床上卸下来，换上大连工矿车辆厂冶金设备的部件。……这种叫一切机械制造给冶金机械让路的作法，这种当一般工程同重点工程矛盾时一律停车让路的作法，这种放下次要任务突击冶金设备的作法，就是要有所不为而后才能有所为的表现。
    “不为”和“为”，是对立的统一，我们有所不为，并不是消极的不为，其目的是为了有所为，而且是为了大有所为。我们在一定的时期，只能抓几件主要的东西，把主要的东西抓住了，对于次要的东西，力量不足时就可以放下一些。这种有所不为，是完全必要的。因为第一，它使最为紧要应该优先发展的东西得到了有力的保证；第二，看起来这好像是使某些次要生产建设项目延缓了发展速度或者缩小了发展规模，但是实际上却是为它今后大大发展创造了条件。我国的工业生产建设中，如果不首先保证钢铁和机械工业的发展，那么其他方面的发展就会是很困难甚至是不可能的，只有首先集中力量保证钢铁和机械的生产的发展，这两个“元帅”就能反过来支援和保证其他工业的快速发展。所以有所不为的结果，归根结蒂，并不是延缓了而是加快了各种生产建设事业的发展速度，并不是缩小了而是扩大了各种生产建设事业的发展规模。一句话，就是有所不为而后才能有所为，才能大有所为。
    当然，为了集中力量发展钢铁生产而有所不为，并不是说要把所有其他的生产都停下来，大家都去单打一地搞钢铁生产，而是说要把钢铁的生产和建设放在首要的地位，当钢铁工业的发展同其他工业的发展发生矛盾的时候，其他工业应当让路给钢铁工业先行。事物本身是对立而又统一的存在与发展着的，只求统一而否定对立的存在是不行的。只要大家都能够从首先为钢的全局观点出发，就不难分清轻重缓急，确定何者为主，而使自己有所为而又有所不为了。
