    Shandong Produces Over 60,000 Tons of Iron Daily
    Shanxi Produces 25,000 Tons of Iron Daily

    (Reported by our newspaper in Jinan on September 30th) The people of Shandong, with their glorious revolutionary tradition and the great spirit of the Huaihai Campaign, have achieved brilliant results on the iron and steel front, launching a giant satellite with a daily output of more than 60,000 tons of pig iron.

    Ten million iron and steel workers across the province began their general offensive at 00:00 on the 29th. Hundreds of thousands of various types of iron smelting furnaces showed their prowess, their flames coloring half the sky red. After twenty-four hours of continuous combat, statistics up to 00:00 on the 30th showed that the province had overfulfilled its September production target of 200,000 tons of pig iron one day ahead of schedule, far exceeding the original target of striving to achieve a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron. The daily pig iron production jumped from 3,674.7 tons on the 28th to 67,390 tons (including 53,308 tons of second-class iron); the province also produced 36,203 tons of sintered iron. Among them, Zibo City produced 22,384.05 tons of pig iron daily, and another 5,553.15 tons of sintered iron; Changwei Prefecture produced 11,872.3 tons of pig iron daily, and another 3,732.25 tons of sintered iron. There are twenty-five counties and cities with a daily output of over 1,000 tons: Linyi, Cangshan, Rizhao, Ju County, Pingyi, Fei County, Yantai, Haiyang, Rushan, Wendeng, Muping, Laixi, Laiyang, Weifang, Pingdu, Changi, Yidu, Anqiu, Boshan, Jiaonan, Jimo, Zhangqiu, Tai'an, Laiwu, and Teng County.

    The joint effort of Party, government, army, and people is an important factor in the complete victory of this iron and steel Huaihai Campaign. In the upsurge of the whole Party and the whole people smelting iron and steel, all organizations, factories, schools, troops, and residents built various types of iron smelting furnaces. The sound of hammers hitting ore, limestone, and coke was constant day and night. Among the people smashing ore, there were elderly people in their seventies and eighties, Young Pioneers, female textile workers, professors, students, farmers, shop assistants, provincial Party secretaries, army generals, and even seven or eight-year-old children accompanying adults to participate in labor.

    To ensure the launching of the steel satellite, the logistics army fought day and night. In the past seven days, more than 66,000 tons of coke have been added to production, and more than 529,000 tons of ore have been mined. These coke and ore were promptly transported to the furnaces by various vehicles and ships.

    At present, ten million iron and steel workers across the province are making persistent efforts, determined to continue fighting hard for two days and nights, expand the victory, and strive to stabilize production, and to strive to complete and overfulfill the annual production target of one million tons of steel ahead of schedule.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 30th) Shanxi Province launched a high-yield "satellite" on the 29th, with a daily output of 25,700 tons of pig iron and 3,900 tons of steel.

    On this day, nearly 50,000 newly added earthen furnaces, small converters, earthen open-hearth furnaces, and crucible furnaces throughout the province all produced steel and iron. People who had been fighting continuously for several days and nights were ecstatic about the high yield of steel and iron at the furnaces, and their determination to fight was even higher. Farmers in Jincheng County, under the slogan of "the waves behind push the waves ahead, breaking through the 2,000-ton barrier," achieved a daily pig iron output of 2,207 tons. Gaoping County, which came from behind, also created a new record of 2,500 tons per day. The daily pig iron output of eight counties, including Lingchuan and Yangcheng, also reached 1,000 tons.

    The emergence of high-yield steel and iron "satellites" in Shanxi Province is the result of resolutely implementing the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy. In the early stage of vigorously developing the iron and steel industry throughout the province, the progress of steel and iron production was slow due to neglecting the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy. On September 15, after studying this situation, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China resolutely implemented the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy, and small earthen furnaces developed rapidly like bamboo shoots after rain. At present, the iron and steel army in the province has grown to more than 2.2 million people.

    山东日产铁六万多吨
    山西日产铁两万五千吨
    本报济南30日电　有着光荣革命传统的山东人民，以淮海战役的伟大气概，在钢铁战线上获得了辉煌战果，放出了日产生铁六万七千多吨的巨型卫星。
    全省一千万钢铁大军从29日零时起开始了总攻。数十万座各式炼铁炉大显神通，它们升起的火光染红半边天。经过二十四小时的连续战斗，到30日零时止的统计，全省提前一天超额完成了9月份生产生铁二十万吨的任务，大大超过了原订力争实现日产生铁万吨的指标。这一天的生铁日产量，由28日的三千六百七十四点七吨一跃而为六万七千三百九十吨（内有二类铁五万三千三百零八吨）；全省还外产烧结铁三万六千二百零三吨。其中，淄博市日产生铁二万二千三百八十四点零五吨，另产烧结铁五千五百五十三点一五吨；昌潍专区日产生铁一万一千八百七十二点三吨，另产烧结铁三千七百三十二点二五吨。日产千吨以上的县、市有二十五个：临沂、苍山、日照、莒县、平邑、费县、烟台、海阳、乳山、文登、牟平、莱西、莱阳、潍坊、平度、昌邑、益都、安丘、博山、胶南、即墨、章丘、泰安、莱芜、滕县。
    党政军民一起动手，是这次钢铁淮海战役获得全胜的一个重要因素，在全党全民炼钢铁的热潮中，所有机关、工厂、学校、部队、居民都筑起各式炼铁炉，砸矿石、石灰石、焦炭的锤击声，日夜不断，在砸矿石的人们中，有七、八十岁的老人、少先队员、纱厂女工，教授、学生、农民、店员，也有省委书记、军队的将军，甚至还有随同大人一起参加劳动的七八岁的儿童。
    为保证钢铁卫星上天，各路后勤大军也进行了夜以继日的战斗。最近七天中就增产了六万六千多吨焦炭，开采了五十二万九千多吨矿石，这些焦炭和矿石都及时地由各式车辆和船只运到了炉旁。
    目前，全省一千万钢铁大军正在再接再厉，决定继续苦战两昼夜，乘胜扩大战果，并且争取稳定产量，为提前完成和超额完成全年一百万吨钢铁的生产任务而奋斗。
    据新华社太原30日电　山西省在29日发射出日产二万五千七百吨生铁、三千九百吨钢的高产“卫星”。
    这一天，全省新增加的近五万座土方炉、小转炉、土平炉、坩埚炉，都出钢、出铁。已经连续奋战几昼夜的人们，在炉子边为钢铁高产欢欣若狂，战斗的决心更为高涨。晋城县农民在“后浪推前浪，突破二千吨关”的口号下，生铁日产量达到了二千二百零七吨。后来居上的高平县也创造了日产二千五百吨的新纪录。陵川和阳城等八个县，这一天的生铁日产量也都达到了一千吨。
    山西省出现钢铁高产“卫星”，是坚决贯彻“小、土、群”方针的结果。全省在大办钢铁工业的初期，由于忽略“小、土、群”的方针，结果钢铁生产进展不快。9月15日，中共山西省委研究了这种情况以后，坚决贯彻“小、土、群”方针，小型的土炉，就像雨后春笋般地迅速发展起来。目前，全省钢铁大军已经发展到二百二十多万人。
