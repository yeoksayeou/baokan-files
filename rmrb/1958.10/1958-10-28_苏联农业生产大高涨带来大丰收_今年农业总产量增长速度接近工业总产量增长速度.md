Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 26th. As the Soviet Union commemorates the 41st anniversary of the October Revolution, it faces a year of bumper harvest and a great leap in agriculture. Many agricultural experts point out that the current prosperity of Soviet agriculture is unprecedented in the thirty-plus years since the establishment of the collective farm system. The characteristics of this situation are: an unprecedented increase in the overall level of agriculture, a leap in key agricultural sectors, agricultural production that greatly guarantees the needs of the people and light industry, and the continuous strengthening of the collective farm economy, with ownership developing and improving.

The main signs of the great development of Soviet agriculture and the improvement of the overall agricultural level in recent years are: the increase in agricultural output has greatly accelerated, catching up with the speed of industrial output increase. From 1954 to 1957, the total output of agricultural products increased several times over. During these four years, the total grain output of the Soviet Union increased by 27% compared with the previous four years. Flax increased by 90%. Compared with 1953, meat increased by 38% and milk increased by 50% in 1957. Other crops such as cotton and beets also increased significantly. In total, the total output of all agricultural products increased by 7.1% annually compared to the previous year. This average speed is equivalent to the planned growth rate of total industrial output in 1957.

This year, Soviet agriculture has achieved greater development, reaching the highest level in the thirty-plus years since the establishment of the collective farm system. Although the grain harvesting work has not yet been fully completed nationwide, the good prospects for increasing the total grain harvest this year are becoming increasingly clear. This year's beet harvest is the largest in Soviet history. In the first half of this year, the number of cattle in collective farms and state farms increased by 4.5 million head compared with the first half of last year, pigs increased by 3.3 million head, and sheep increased by more than 8 million. Therefore, the growth rate of total Soviet agricultural output this year will definitely exceed the average of 7%, and will be closer to the growth rate of total industrial output.

In the past four years, the total cash income of Soviet collective farms has doubled due to crop cultivation and nearly tripled due to animal husbandry. Both the income per farmer and the income from each hectare of agricultural land have more than doubled in four or five years.

The fundamental reason for the substantial development of Soviet agriculture in recent years is that the Party has paid more attention to agriculture and has paid close attention to strengthening the leadership of agriculture. From the Central Plenary Session to the Party committees at all levels, agricultural issues are frequently studied. While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the Party concentrated more manpower and material resources to support agriculture. The Party has taken a series of major measures such as reclaiming wasteland, improving the agricultural planning system, improving the agricultural product procurement system, and reorganizing machine tractor stations. The Party has selected a large number of people to strengthen leadership in agriculture.

Developing agriculture remains a key focus of the Soviet Union's future long-term plans. It can be predicted that agriculture will continue to develop at a higher rate than in the past few years, and the task of exceeding the United States in per capita output may be accomplished first in agriculture.

    苏联农业生产大高涨带来大丰收
    今年农业总产量增长速度接近工业总产量增长速度
    新华社莫斯科26日电　在纪念十月革命四十一周年的时候，苏联面临着农业大丰收、大高涨的一个年头。许多农业专家指出，苏联现在农业的繁荣局面为集体农庄制度建立三十多年来所未有。这个局面的特点是：农业整个水平空前提高，重要农业部门飞跃上升，农产品的生产大大保证了人民和轻工业的需要，集体农庄经济不断加强，所有制在发展和提高。
    苏联最近几年来农业大发展、整个农业水平提高的主要标志是：农业产量的增加速度大大加快，直追工业产量提高的速度。从1954年起到1957年的四年间，农产品总产量增长的速度翻了好几番。这四年间，苏联谷物总产量比前四年增加27％。亚麻增加90％，同1953年相比，1957年肉类增加38％，牛奶增加50％。其他如棉花、甜菜等也有显著的增加。总合算起来，全部农产品总产量每年比前一年增加7.1％。这一平均速度已相当于1957年工业总产量计划增长的速度。
    今年苏联农业获得了更大的发展，达到集体农庄制度建立三十多年来的最高水平。虽然谷物收割工作在全国范围内还没有全部结束，但是今年谷物总收获量增加的良好前景越来越明显了。今年甜菜的收成是苏联有史以来最大的一次。今年上半年，集体农庄和国营农场的牛比去年上半年增加了四百五十万头，猪增加了三百三十万口，羊增加了八百多万只。因此，今年苏联农产品总产量的增加速度一定又会突破7％的平均数，更加接近工业总产量的增长速度。
    最近四年来，苏联集体农庄的现金总收入由于种植业而来的翻了一番，由于畜牧业而来的将近翻了两番。不论是每一农户的收入还是从每一公顷农业土地上的收入都在四、五年内的时间内翻了一番还多。
    苏联农业近几年来获得长足发展的根本原因是党更加重视农业，十分注意加强农业的领导。从中央全会起到各级党委会经常研究农业问题。在优先发展重工业的同时，党集中更大的人力、物力以支援农业。党采取了像开垦荒地、改进农业计划制度、改善农产品采购制度、改组机器拖拉机站等一系列重大的措施。党选派了大批人力充实农业中的领导。
    发展农业仍然是苏联今后远景计划中的一个重点。可以预料的是，农业仍将继续以比过去几年更高的速度发展，而按人口计算超过美国的任务将可能首先在农业中完成。
