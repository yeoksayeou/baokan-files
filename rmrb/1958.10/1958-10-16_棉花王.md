    A cotton king plant at the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, is attracting people from all over, and many people come to visit every day. This cotton king plant is nine chi tall, has a waist circumference of more than seven chi, and thirty-five fruit branches extend outwards, each branch is three to four and a half chi long, with a total of 502 cotton bolls, of which 269 are mature bolls, each cotton boll is as big as an egg.
    Currently, this flower is growing vigorously, the main stem is growing new fruit branches every day, and tender green buds appear at the tips of the new and old fruit branches every day. After the National Day, it has been placed in a glass room to safely spend the winter, continue to grow, and bear more than 500 more cotton bolls. According to the calculation of picking one jin of cotton for every fifty cotton bolls, the existing cotton bolls of this cotton king can be picked for ten jin of cotton. If 2,000 plants are planted per mu and all can grow like this, the yield per mu can reach 20,000 jin. After testing, the cotton picked from this cotton king has excellent quality and a绒 length of 40 mm.
    This cotton king was cultivated by comrades Ji Tianfu, a traffic officer, and Zhang Ronggui, a mail clerk, of the institute in a one-mu experimental field, and the Party branch and administrative leaders gave them great support. Before sowing, the land was deeply ploughed to a depth of three and a half chi. After sowing on April 15, the two of them spent all their spare time in this one-mu experimental field.

    棉花王
    河北省石家庄专区农业科学研究所的一棵棉花王，吸引着各地的人们，每天都有不少人前来参观。这棵棉花王身长九尺，腰粗七尺有余，三十五个果枝向四外伸展着，每枝有三尺至四尺半长，共结棉桃五百零二个，其中老桃就已有二百六十九个，每个棉桃像鸡蛋那样大。
    目前，这棵花正在茁壮的生长着，主干天天都长出新的果枝，新、老果枝的尖端天天都出现嫩绿的新芽。国庆节过后，已经把它罩在玻璃室里面，让它安全渡过冬天，并继续生长，再结五百个以上的棉桃。按每五十个棉桃摘一斤棉花计算，这棵棉花王现有的棉桃就可摘花十斤，如果一亩地种二千棵都能长成这样，即可达到亩产二万斤。经过试验，这棵棉花王上摘下的棉花，质量很好，绒长四十毫米。
    这棵棉花王是该所交通员纪田福和收发员张荣贵二同志共同在一亩试验田里培育的，党支部和行政领导上给了他们很大支持。在播种以前，地深翻了三尺半，从4月15日播种后，他二人把全部业余时间都花费在这一亩试验田里。（红才）（附图片）
