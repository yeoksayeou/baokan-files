Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Foreign news agencies report from Taipei that yesterday, sources familiar with the Kuomintang in Taiwan revealed that "Kuomintang leaders are now forced to withdraw some of the troops stationed on the coastal islands in exchange for increased US military and financial aid." They are "agreeing against their will to reduce the number of troops stationed in Kinmen and Matsu."

The report stated, "Despite the announced increase in US military aid, Kuomintang military figures do not conceal their resentment at having to reduce the number of troops stationed on the coastal islands. They have concentrated nearly one-third of their combat troops on the coastal islands." At the same time, "Kuomintang military figures now hope that the Communists will continue to bombard Kinmen in order to postpone the withdrawal; because as long as the bombardment of the coastal islands continues, even if it is intermittent, it will not be suitable for troop withdrawal."

The report said that Taiwan Kuomintang military figures "emphasized" that the results of the Chiang-Dulles talks have already "seriously affected some leaders of Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group)."

    受美国压力被迫减少金马驻军
    台湾军界人士愤懑吐怨声
    新华社29日讯　据外国通讯社从台北发出的消息说，昨天从台湾国民党消息灵通人士方面获悉，“国民党领导人现在已不得不撤退一部分沿海岛屿的驻军，来交换美国增加军事和财政援助”，他们是“违反本意同意减少金门、马祖驻军的”。
    消息说，“尽管宣布增加了美国军事援助，国民党军界人士并不掩饰他们对不得不减少沿海岛屿的驻军感到愤懑，他们在沿海岛屿集中了他们战斗部队的将近三分之一。”同时，“国民党军界人士现在希望共产党继续对金门炮击，以便推迟撤退；因为只要对沿海岛屿的轰击继续下去，即使是时断时续的，也不适宜于撤军。”
    消息说，台湾国民党军界人士“强调指出”，蒋杜会谈的结果已经“严重地影响了自由中国（指蒋介石集团）的一些领导人”。
