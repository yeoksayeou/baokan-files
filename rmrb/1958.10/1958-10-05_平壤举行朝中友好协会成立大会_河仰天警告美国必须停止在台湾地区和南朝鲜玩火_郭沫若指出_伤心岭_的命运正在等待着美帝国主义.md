Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. The inaugural meeting of the Korea-China Friendship Association was solemnly held tonight at the Moranbong Theater in Pyongyang.

    Among those attending the inaugural meeting were Korean Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Hong Myong-hui and Nam Il, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jeong-ae and Kim Chang-man, Minister of Justice Heo Jeong-suk, and others. Also attending the meeting were the Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation headed by General Ren Rong, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, and diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in North Korea.

    Ha Ang-cheon, alternate member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, said in his report at the meeting that the establishment of the Korea-China Friendship Association is to consolidate and develop the traditional fraternal friendship and cultural ties between the peoples of Korea and China. He said that the Korean people cherish their fraternal friendship and solidarity with the Chinese people like their own eyes.

    Ha Ang-cheon pointed out that the peoples of Korea and China have helped each other and lived together since ancient times. Korean communists, led by Kim Il-sung, fought alongside the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism. During the most difficult time of the Korean War, the Chinese people sent the Volunteer Army to aid the Korean people with their blood. The Korean people will forever sing the epic of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea" for generations to come. He said that the Chinese people have given the Korean people tremendous assistance after the war. The Chinese people have always been our reliable allies in any period, and the Korean people feel the greatest honor and pride in having friends like the Chinese people.

    Ha Ang-cheon also said that the prosperity and development of Korea and China and the mutual cooperation, friendly unity between the two peoples are important factors in safeguarding peace in the Far East.

    Ha Ang-cheon condemned the acts of military provocation by U.S. imperialism in the Taiwan Strait. He said that the U.S. aggressors must immediately stop playing with fire in the Taiwan area and South Korea and immediately get out of the Far East. If U.S. imperialism forgets the lessons of the Korean battlefield and continues to engage in military adventures, it will bring about its own destruction.

    Guo Moruo, in his speech at the meeting, first warmly congratulated the birth of the Korea-China Friendship Association. He said: We firmly believe that the establishment of the Korea-China Friendship Association and the China-Korea Friendship Association will further consolidate and strengthen the great friendship between our two peoples. He said that the friendship between the peoples of China and Korea has been consolidated and developed in the long-term struggle against common enemies. The Korean people defended the independence of their country and also safeguarded the security of China in the patriotic war against U.S. aggression. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army received the support and care of the Korean people and the Korean government like relatives during and after the Korean War. No force in the world can break through the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged with blood.

    Guo Moruo said: We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism that the voluntary withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea does not change the Chinese people's international obligations to the Korean people in the slightest. We warmly support the Korean people's desire to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland. If U.S. imperialism dares to launch another war in Korea, the Chinese people could not and never will ignore it.

    Guo Moruo also condemned U.S. imperialism's acts of war provocation in the Taiwan Strait. He said that U.S. imperialism has ignored the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese government and recently instigated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to use missiles to attack the Chinese mainland. This serious crime is absolutely intolerable to our people. He emphasized: We believe that the people of the socialist camp, the peace-loving people of the world, and the heroic Korean people are with us. Any war provocation by U.S. imperialism will suffer a shameful defeat. The fate of Shangganling "Heartbreak Ridge" awaits U.S. imperialism.

    Subsequently, representatives of various social organizations and Seok Gil-rong, a Korean woman who has a close relationship with the Volunteer Army, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of Korea and China.

    The meeting then adopted the charter of the association and elected the central organs of the association. Ha Ang-cheon was elected Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Korea-China Friendship Association, and Hyun Pil-hoon, editor-in-chief of "Rodong Sinmun", and Major General Seo Cheol, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, were elected Vice Chairmen.

    On behalf of the Chinese People's Delegation, Guo Moruo, head of the delegation, presented a flag and gifts to the Korea-China Friendship Association. The flag was embroidered with a poem in gold letters: "The friendship between China and Korea will last for ten thousand years; like brothers and sisters, shoulder to shoulder; defending the country and protecting the family, fighting against the enemy together; the blood of heroes dyes the red flag bright". General Ren Rong, head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation, also presented a flag to the Korea-China Friendship Association on behalf of the Volunteer Army.

    河仰天警告美国必须停止在台湾地区和南朝鲜玩火
    郭沫若指出“伤心岭”的命运正在等待着美帝国主义
    新华社平壤3日电　朝中友好协会成立大会今天晚上在平壤市牡丹峰剧场隆重举行。
    参加成立大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹、南日，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、金昌满，司法相许贞淑等。参加大会的还有以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团、以任荣将军为首的中国人民志愿军代表团、中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光，以及各国驻朝鲜外交使节等。
    朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员会候补委员河仰天在大会上作报告时说，朝中友好协会的成立，是为了巩固和发展朝中两国人民的传统的兄弟般的友好关系和文化联系。他说，朝鲜人民像爱护眼珠一样，爱护同中国人民的兄弟般的友谊团结。
    河仰天指出，朝中两国人民自古以来就互相帮助，生活在一起。以金日成为首的朝鲜共产主义者曾经同中国人民一道进行了反抗日本帝国主义的斗争。在朝鲜战争最艰苦的时候，中国人民派来了志愿军，用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。朝鲜人民子孙万代将永远歌颂“抗美援朝”的史诗。他说，战后
  中国人民又给予朝鲜人民以巨大的援助。中国人民在任何时期一直是我们的可靠的同盟者，朝鲜人民为有像中国人民这样的朋友而感到最大的荣誉和自豪。
    河仰天还说，朝中两国的繁荣发展和两国人民间的互相合作、友好团结是保卫远东和平的重要因素。
    河仰天谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行军事挑衅的行为。他说，美国侵略者必须立即停止在台湾地区和南朝鲜的玩火行为，并且立即从远东滚出去，如果美帝国主义忘掉了朝鲜战场上的教训，继续进行军事冒险，它将自取灭亡。
    郭沫若在大会上讲话时，首先热烈祝贺朝中友好协会的诞生。他说，我们坚信：朝中友好协会和中朝友好协会的成立，将会使我们两国人民之间的伟大友谊日益巩固和加强。他说，中朝两国人民的友谊是在长期的反对共同敌人的斗争中巩固发展起来的。朝鲜人民在反对美国侵略的卫国战争中，捍卫了国家的独立，同时也保障了中国的安全。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战时和战后受到了朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府的亲人般的支援和关怀。世界上没有任何力量能够冲破中朝人民以鲜血结成的战斗友谊。
    郭沫若说，我们严正地警告美帝国主义，中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜丝毫也不改变中国人民对朝鲜人民的国际义务。我们热烈支持朝鲜人民实现和平统一祖国的愿望，如果美帝国主义胆敢在朝鲜再发动战争的话，中国人民过去是，将来也永远是不能够置之不理的。
    郭沫若还谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡进行战争挑衅的行为。他说，美帝国主义无视中国政府的多次严重警告，最近又嗾使蒋介石匪帮使用导弹向中国大陆进攻，这种严重的罪行是我国人民绝对不能容忍的。他强调说，我们相信，社会主义阵营各国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民、英雄的朝鲜人民同我们在一起，美帝国主义的任何战争挑衅都将遭到可耻的惨败，上甘岭“伤心岭”的命运在等待着美帝国主义。
    接着各社会团体的代表和同志愿军有血肉感情的朝鲜妇女石吉荣在会上致了祝词。他们一致表示，要努力加强朝中两国人民的友谊。
    会议接着通过了协会的章程，选出了协会的中央机构。河仰天当选为朝中友好协会常务委员会委员长，“劳动新闻”总编辑玄弼勋和朝鲜人民军总政治局局长徐哲少将当选为副委员长。
    郭沫若团长代表中国人民代表团向朝中友好协会献旗、献礼，献的锦旗上用金字绣着一首诗：“中朝友谊万千年，如兄如弟肩并肩，卫国保家同抗敌，英雄血染红旗鲜”。中国人民志愿军代表团团长任荣将军也代表志愿军向朝中友好协会献旗。
