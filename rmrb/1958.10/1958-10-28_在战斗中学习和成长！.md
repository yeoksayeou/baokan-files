Learning and Growing in Battle!
Fèi Zhèngāng, Secretary of the Chinese Department's Branch 3 of the Chinese Communist Party at Peking University

Establishing a Red Flag in Literary History Research

At the end of July, our school's Party Committee issued a call to go all out in scientific research, fight hard for forty days, and offer a gift to the National Day. Our classmates in the grade abandoned their plans to return home for the summer vacation, determined to contribute their strength to the great leap forward in scientific research under the leadership of the Party. In the process of brainstorming and discussion, the students of Class 3 proposed to work together to write a completely new Chinese literary history with a completely new system. On the basis of a consensus among the students, after more than a month of day and night hard work, and through the collective writing, discussion and modification of more than fifty students staying on campus, a preliminary draft of a 700,000-word Chinese literary history was finally completed.

The completion of this literary history is the result of liberation from the shackles of bourgeois thought. In the previous period, in the movement to reform teaching and criticize bourgeois academic viewpoints, we criticized Mr. Lin Geng, a professor in our department. Through this criticism, we saw that in the literary history works of bourgeois experts, in addition to a large number of tedious textual research and the accumulation of materials, there were also distorted interpretations of classical writers and works from the standpoint of bourgeois ideology; we also saw the poverty and fallacies of their works' ideological content. We are determined to completely break with the erroneous views of literary research of feudal scholars and bourgeois experts of the past, to use the collective wisdom to write a literary history. We must stand on the proletarian position, use the revolutionary and critical spirit of Marxism-Leninism to correctly evaluate the rich literary heritage of the motherland, and expound their development process; we must restore the orthodox position of folk literature, and correctly explain the great influence of folk literature on writer literature and the entire literary development; we must implement the principle of "emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past," conduct detailed research on literature since the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and be determined to fill in the blank area of literary history research from the Opium War to the May Fourth Movement. Such a literary history could not have been written by any bourgeois experts in the past.

Our compilation of this literary history is also in response to the call of the Party Central Committee to plant red flags and pull out white flags in all academic fields. Bourgeois experts have been trying their best to spread bourgeois ideological viewpoints in the literary history research department, and use their academic status as capital to bargain with the Party and the people for fame and gain, as the last corner of the position to resist socialist transformation. In 1956, the Higher Education Department entrusted a group of experts and professors to write a literary history textbook to serve socialist cultural construction, giving them extremely favorable working conditions, but some of them did not work seriously, but took the opportunity to engage in private research topics. Of course, there was no collective writing, and this literary history has not yet met readers today. Can we still tolerate these?

Politics in Command, Breaking Down Superstitions, Liberating Thought

In our work, we deeply feel the importance of breaking down superstitions and liberating thought, but we also feel that breaking down superstitions and liberating thought is not accomplished at once, but is a gradual process. At first, when we were preparing to criticize Mr. Lin Geng, some people thought it was a thankless task, but we organized some people to start working first, and we made achievements, which could not but make some people abandon their original views and participate in the criticism work. When we were preparing to write literary history, some people doubted again. They said, "Experts take several years to write it, but we have to write it in a few dozen days, how can that be done?" In response to this situation, we organized discussions. Through careful calculations, everyone agreed that we have more than fifty people working, and each person works forty days, which is equivalent to one person's seven or eight years of work. Not only that, we are also a collective, we have correct views and methods, we have the direct leadership of the Party, and we will definitely be able to write it. This doubt was resolved, but problems still occurred in the work: many people were bound by the materials after reading them, unable to jump out of the frame; some people, although they believed that our views were correct, may not be as clear and powerful as bourgeois experts in specific discussions. At this time, we solved specific ideological problems, so that everyone gradually clarified that we must use correct viewpoints to analyze and identify materials, and at the same time absorb the research results of our predecessors, and not be slaves to materials; clarified that our work is mainly to be completed by the collective, to give full play to our greatest subjective initiative, and to give full play to the collective wisdom and strength.

To liberate thought and break down superstitions, first of all, there must be correct ideological viewpoints as guidance. To this end, in the first few days of our work, we concentrated on studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other relevant literary remarks of Marxist-Leninist classical writers, and combined it with discussions on the style of writing literary history and some problems in literary history. In the discussion, we deeply felt how the bourgeois experts, due to their class bias, distorted the phenomena in literary history. They praised the poet Wang Wei, who had obvious anti-realist tendencies with "In middle age, I am quite fond of the Tao, and I don't care about anything," but they were surprisingly cold to the great realist poet Bai Juyi's New Yuefu poems that "only sing of the suffering of the people," believing that these were works of low artistic quality. Because this ideological viewpoint of bourgeois scholars also had a serious impact on the students, therefore, in the discussion, we criticized the trans-class pure artistic viewpoint of the writers and works existing among the students. This argument is an argument between two different ideas. As a result of the debate, our thoughts were armed, and we could evaluate writers and works from a higher perspective, and explain the phenomenon of literary development.

Collective Collaboration, Double Harvest of Scientific Research and Thought

The literary history we compiled is the crystallization of collective labor and the crystallization of communist collaboration. All the students who participated in the work have been working tensely and rhythmically like a machine for more than a month. Everyone is a gear or screw on this machine. In the work, we help each other and learn from each other. After one person completes the work, they immediately go to help others. After one group completes the work, they immediately go to help another group. Of course, in the work, there is also the struggle between collectivism and individualism. Individual students are not at ease with collective work, and attempt to engage in personal "side jobs," and some hope to take on the writing of important parts, but are unwilling to take on the writing of minor parts and auxiliary work. For these, we have carried out criticism and help, and more importantly, through collective work, we have made them see the greatness of collective power and the insignificance of individuals in the face of the collective, so that they gradually integrated into the collective. Collective collaboration, mass science, is the only way for scientific research work to be done more, faster, better and more economically, which is the Party's instruction to us.

In this month, each of our students deeply felt the care of the Party, and drew endless strength from it. The Party encouraged us, a group of young people, to boldly criticize bourgeois academic thoughts, and the Party supported our proposal to write literary history. The Party Branch Secretary came to our grade more than once to understand the situation and help solve problems; the Branch Committee also held a special meeting to study this issue. All this has greatly encouraged and inspired the students. The idea of collective collaboration instructed by the Party has ensured our rapid progress on the road of scientific research. We are determined to continue to deepen ideological revolution and continue to learn in battle under the guidance of the Party. Only in this way can we become literary workers who are both red and expert!

    在战斗中学习和成长！
    中共北京大学中文系文三支部书记　费振刚
    在文学史研究中树立红旗
    7月底，我校党委发出了大干科学研究，苦战四十天，向国庆献礼的号召。我们年级同学纷纷放弃了暑假回家的计划，决心在党的领导下，在科学研究大跃进中贡献自己的力量。在酝酿讨论中，三班同学提出要通力合作，写出一部内容全新、体制全新的中国文学史的倡议。在同学们思想认识一致的基础上，经过一个多月的日夜苦战，经过留校五十多个同学集体写作、讨论和修改，一部七十万字的中国文学史初稿终于完成了。
    这部文学史的完成，是从资产阶级思想束缚下解放出来的结果。前一个时期，在教学改革、批判资产阶级学术观点的运动中，我们对我系教授林庚先生进行了批判。通过这次批判，我们看到了资产阶级专家的文学史著作中，除了大量的繁琐考证和材料的堆砌外，再就是从资产阶级思想观点出发，对于古典作家和作品进行歪曲的解释；我们也看到了他们著作中的思想内容的贫乏和谬误。我们决心跟历代的封建学者和资产阶级专家的文学研究的错误观点彻底决裂，用集体的智慧，写出一部文学史来。我们要站在无产阶级的立场，用马克思列宁主义的革命的批判的精神去正确评价祖国丰富的文学遗产，并阐述它们的发展过程；我们要恢复民间文学的正统地位，正确说明民间文学对作家文学和整个文学发展的巨大影响；我们要贯彻“厚今薄古”的原则，对于宋元以来的文学作详细研究，并决心补上鸦片战争到“五四”运动这一段文学史研究的空白地区。这样的文学史是过去一切资产阶级专家所无法写成的。
    我们这部文学史的编著也是响应党中央在一切学术领域中插红旗拔白旗的号召。资产阶级专家一直在文学史研究部门中竭力散布资产阶级的思想观点，并以他们的学术地位作为向党向人民讨价还价争名争利的资本，作为抗拒社会主义改造的最后一角阵地。1956年高教部委托一批专家教授写一部为社会主义文化建设服务的文学史教科书，给了他们极优厚的工作条件，但他们有些人并没有认真地进行工作，反而乘机大搞私人研究题目，当然，更谈不到集体写作了，这部文学史直到今天还没有和读者见面。对于这些，我们还能容忍吗？
    政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放思想
    在工作中我们深深感到破除迷信、解放思想的重要，但也感觉到破除迷信解放思想不是一次完成的，是一个逐步深入的过程。最初我们准备批判林庚先生时，有人认为这是费力不讨好的事，但是我们组织了一些人先干了起来，而且作出了成绩，这就不能不使一些人抛弃了原来的看法，参加了批判工作。当我们准备写文学史时，有人又怀疑了。他们说：“人家专家几年才写出来，而我们要在几十天写出，那怎么能成呢？”针对这种情况，我们组织了讨论。通过算细账，大家一致认为：我们有五十多人工作，每人工作四十天，这就相当于一个人七、八年的工作量。不仅如此，我们还是一个集体，我们有正确的观点和方法，我们有着党的直接领导，我们一定能写出来。这个怀疑解决了，但在工作中仍然发生问题：许多人看了材料，就被材料所束缚，跳不出框子；有的人虽然认为我们的观点正确，但在具体论述上可能赶不上资产阶级专家那样清晰有力。在这种时候，我们就解决具体思想问题，使大家逐渐明确了必须用正确观点去分析鉴别材料，同时也要吸取前人的研究成果，不要作材料奴隶；明确了我们的工作主要是依靠集体来完成，要发挥自己最大的能动性，又要发挥集体的智慧和力量。
    解放思想破除迷信，首先要有正确的思想观点作指导。为此，我们在工作开初几天，集中地学习了毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”以及其他马克思列宁主义经典作家的有关文艺的言论，并结合对于编写文学史的体例以及文学史上一些问题进行讨论。在讨论中，我们深深感到由于资产阶级专家的阶级偏爱，他们是怎样歪曲了文学史上的现象。他们把“中年颇好道，万事不关心”的具有很明显反现实主义倾向的诗人王维推崇备至，而对于伟大的现实主义诗人白居易那些“唯歌生民苦”的新乐府诗却抱着出奇的冷淡态度，认为这些是艺术性不高的作品。由于资产阶级学者这种思想观点对同学也有着严重的影响，因此，我们在讨论中批判了同学中存在的对于作家作品的超阶级纯艺术观点。这种争论是两种不同思想的争论。争论的结果，使我们的思想武装起来了，能站在较高的角度去评价作家和作品，去解释文学发展现象了。
    集体协作，科研、思想双丰收
    我们编成的文学史是集体劳动的结晶，是共产主义协作的结晶。全体参加工作的同学，在一个多月来，像一部机器一样紧张而又有节奏的工作着。每个人就是这部机器上的齿轮或螺丝钉。在工作中互相帮助，互相学习，一个人工作完成后马上去帮助别人，一个小组工作完成后马上去帮助另外的小组。当然，在工作中也还有集体主义与个人主义的斗争，个别的同学不安心集体工作，企图搞个人的“副业”，有的则希望担任重要部分的写作，而不愿担任次要部分的写作和作辅助工作。对于这些，我们进行了批评和帮助，更主要的是通过集体工作，使他们看到集体力量的巨大，和个人在集体面前的渺小，使他们渐渐融入了集体之中。集体协作，群众办科学，是科学研究工作能够作到多快好省的唯一途径，这是党指示给我们的。
    在这一个月里，我们每个同学都深切地感受到党的关怀，并且从中吸取了无穷无尽的力量。党鼓励我们这群年青人大胆地去批判资产阶级学术思想，党支持我们写文学史的倡议。党总支书记不止一次到我们年级来了解情况，帮助解决问题；总支委员会还专门召开会议研究了这一问题。这一切都使同学们受到很大的激励和鼓舞。党所指示的集体协作的思想，保证了我们在科学研究道路上飞速前进。我们决心在党的教导下，继续深入思想革命，不断在战斗中学习。只有这样，我们才能成为又红又专的文学工作者！
