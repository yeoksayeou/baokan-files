	The Mass Line in Teaching Work
	Zhu Bin
	Regarding how to specifically apply the mass line in teaching work, Tsinghua University has provided valuable experiences.
	The Tsinghua University Party Committee not only relied on teachers and students to revise teaching plans and syllabi, relied on the combination of students, teachers, and workers to write textbooks, but also mobilized teachers and students to go to factories and mining enterprises outside the school to invite advanced individuals as teachers, absorb the experience of advanced individuals to compile teaching materials, and invite advanced producers and advanced workers to give lectures on campus or on site. This combines the forces within the school with forces outside the school, further strengthening the connection between the school and society, and enriching the content of teaching. This method of breaking away from simply using old textbooks, going deep into reality, going deep into the masses, and promptly absorbing the creations of the masses in practice into teaching materials is a major revolution in the compilation of teaching materials. In terms of lecturing methods, workers lecture first, and teachers and students listen. Then, workers, students, and teachers engage in labor together. After labor, teachers provide systematic theoretical lectures. Students and workers conduct open discussions and debates. After the students make a summary of the discussion, workers and teachers supplement and revise it. This not only unifies teaching with productive labor, but also leverages the collective power of teachers, students, and workers, allowing the knowledge of the teachers, the learners, and the doers to grow simultaneously, and greatly improving the quality of teaching. This is the specific practice of the mass line in teaching work.
	Some people say that this approach negates the role of teachers. In fact, quite the contrary, this is precisely to give full play to the role of teachers, and to facilitate teachers' further studies and improvement. The reason is very simple: as long as these teachers put down their airs and mingle with workers and students, they can not only learn practical knowledge and make up for their shortcomings, but also better understand the students. In this way, they can better guide students' learning, play a greater role in teaching, and gain greater trust and respect from students, workers, and peasants. Of course, this approach is a very profound revolution for many teachers, especially for some older teachers who have become accustomed to putting on airs of "authority." If someone still considers themselves an "authority" and is unwilling to cooperate with workers and students, and is unwilling to give play to the role of students, then they will become even more detached from the masses and detached from reality.
	Tsinghua University's experience in implementing the mass line in teaching can provide a reference for other institutions of higher learning, especially engineering and agricultural colleges. We hope that higher education institutions in various regions can, on the basis of work-study programs, mobilize teachers, students, workers, and peasants to jointly summarize production experience, thoroughly carry out teaching reform, and improve the quality of teaching.

    教学工作中的群众路线
    朱彬
    在教学工作中如何具体运用群众路线，清华大学又提供了值得重视的经验。
    清华大学党委不仅依靠教师和学生修订教学计划、教学大纲，依靠学生、教师、工人三结合写作教科书，而且还发动师生到校外厂矿企业去请先进者为师，吸收先进者的经验来编写教材，请先进生产者、先进工作者到校内或在现场进行讲课，把校内的力量和校外的力量结合起来，进一步加强了学校和社会的联系，丰富了教学的内容。这种摆脱只运用旧书本的作法，深入实际，深入群众，把群众在实际中的创造及时地吸收到教材中来，是编写教材的大革命。他们在讲课的方法上，先由工人讲，教师学生听，然后工人、学生、教师一起劳动。劳动后再由教师作系统的理论讲授。学生和工人一起鸣放辩论。学生作出讨论总结后，再由工人、教师补充修正。这样既把教学和生产劳动统一起来，又发挥了教师、学生、工人三方面的集体力量，使教的人、学的人和作的人的知识同时增长，教学质量有了很大提高。这就是教学工作中的群众路线的具体实践。
    有些人说，这样做是抹煞教师的作用。其实恰恰相反，这样做正是为了发挥教师的作用，便于教师的进修和提高。道理很简单，这些教师只要放下架子和工人、学生打成一片，不仅可以学到实际知识，弥补他们的不足，而且也能更好地了解学生。这样，才能更好地指导学生学习，才能在教学中发挥更大的作用，也才能获得学生、工人和农民的更大信任和尊重。当然，这种做法，对于许多教师来说，特别是对于一些已经习惯于摆“权威”架子的老教师来说，是一场非常深刻的革命，如果有人仍以“权威”自居，不愿与工人、学生协作，不肯发挥学生的作用，那么他们就更会脱离群众、脱离实际。
    清华大学在教学中贯彻执行群众路线的经验，可以提供其他高等学校、特别是工科、农科院校参考。我们希望各地高等院校能够在勤工俭学的基础上，发动师生和工人、农民一起总结生产经验，彻底地进行教学改革，提高教学质量。
