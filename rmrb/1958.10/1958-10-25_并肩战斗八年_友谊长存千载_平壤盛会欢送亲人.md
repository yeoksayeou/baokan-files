Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th. Over a thousand people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand gathering this afternoon at the National Art Theater to bid farewell to officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters.

In the center of the rostrum were huge portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong, flanked by ten Chinese and North Korean flags.

At precisely 4:00 PM, Korean leaders, including Premier Kim Il-sung, and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander General Yang Yong, Political Commissar General Wang Ping, and Head of the Chinese People's Delegation Guo Moruo, ascended the rostrum amidst warm applause. Korean children dressed in colorful costumes went on stage to present flowers to the Volunteer Army generals and members of the Chinese People's Delegation.

The meeting began with the band playing the national anthems of North Korea and China. Korean Vice Premier Kim Il delivered a farewell speech at the meeting (full text on page six). He said that on the eve of the final farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the hearts of all Korean people were filled with reluctance to part with friends who had shared life and death for eight years, and with endless gratitude. On behalf of the Korean people, the Workers' Party, and the Republic's government, I express my heartfelt thanks and honor to you for brilliantly completing the task of resisting America and aiding Korea. He said that the great achievements left by the brotherly Chinese People's Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on our homeland will forever reside in the hearts of our people.

He said that on this day when the entire Chinese People's Volunteer Army is withdrawing from northern Korea, the U.S. imperialists not only refuse to withdraw from South Korea but are also struggling desperately to permanently occupy South Korea and exacerbate the tense situation. The U.S. imperialists are also carrying out provocative acts against the People's Republic of China, seriously threatening the situation in the Far East.

Kim Il said that if the American aggressors forget the historical lessons of their disastrous defeat in the Korean War, disregard the serious warnings and protests of the people of North Korea and China and peace-loving people around the world, and continue to engage in aggressive schemes and stubbornly take the dangerous road of launching a war, then they will inevitably suffer a defeat even more disastrous than the Korean War.

After Vice Premier Kim Il's speech concluded amidst thunderous applause, Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, presented the letter of gratitude and signature books signed by 6,847,439 people from all walks of life in Korea to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese people to Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, and General Yang Yong, Commander of the Volunteer Army. Vice Chairman Park Jung-ae said: "Today, as we bid farewell to you, we, on behalf of the entire Korean people, convey to you, and through you to the great Chinese people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, this letter of gratitude filled with our deep feelings, and convey the deep friendship and gratitude of the Korean people to them." Then, Vice Chairman Park Jung-ae, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, the Republic's Cabinet, and the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and Li Song-woon, Chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, presented banners to all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army.

General Yang Yong delivered a reply speech amidst warm applause (full text on page six). He first expressed heartfelt gratitude and high respect on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the heroic Korean people who had warmly cared for and loved the Volunteer Army for eight years.

General Yang Yong elaborated on the great victory of the Korean and Chinese people against American aggression and sternly condemned the American aggressors for clinging to South Korea and constantly carrying out war provocations in the Taiwan Strait area of our country. He said that if the American bandits insist on imposing war on the Chinese and North Korean people, then they will inevitably suffer a more shameful defeat.

General Yang Yong said that the withdrawal of the Volunteer Army from North Korea, this great effort for peace, does not mean that the Chinese people have abandoned their internationalist obligations to their fraternal neighbor, the Korean people. After our withdrawal from North Korea, the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army remaining in the Korean Military Armistice Commission will continue to carry out the task of supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement together with the representatives of the Korean People's Army. We firmly believe that whether it is a military fight or a cultural fight, imperialism is doomed to die. Our just cause will surely triumph.

General Yang Yong's speech was met with continuous enthusiastic applause. Then, General Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, handed over the farewell letter and signature book signed by all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army to Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea. General Wang Ping said: "Our army has withdrawn, but the fighting friendship forged by the blood of the people of China and North Korea will last forever, and our hearts will always be together."

Subsequently, General Yang Yong, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, presented banners to the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, the Republic's Cabinet, and the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; General Wang Ping, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, presented banners to the Pyongyang Municipal People's Committee and the Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Korean Workers' Party.

The meeting concluded with the singing of the Internationale.

The following attended today's farewell meeting: Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea; Vice Premiers Hong Myung-hee, Chung Il-yong, Nam Il, and Li Joo-yeon; Park Kim-chul and Kim Chang-man, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; cabinet ministers; ministers of various departments of the Central Committee of the Labor Party; General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense; senior generals of the Korean People's Army; heads of various democratic parties and social organizations; and well-known figures from all walks of life.

Lieutenant General Liang Biye, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Major General Wang Yunrui, Chief of Staff, and more than 450 generals, officers, and soldiers representing the Volunteer Army Headquarters attended today's meeting.

All members of the Chinese People's Delegation, Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea attended the meeting.

    并肩战斗八年　友谊长存千载
    平壤盛会欢送亲人
    杨勇说：留在朝鲜军事停战委员会内的志愿军代表，将同朝鲜人民一道，继续执行监督朝鲜停战协定实施的任务。我们坚信，无论是武打还是文打，帝国主义终究是死路一条。
    据新华社平壤24日电　平壤市各界一千多人今天下午在国立艺术剧场隆重集会欢送中国人民志愿军总部官兵。
    大会主席台中央高悬着金日成首相和毛泽东主席的巨幅画像，两旁高矗着十面朝中两国国旗。
    四时正，朝鲜内阁首相金日成等党和政府的领导人和中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将，政治委员王平上将，中国人民代表团郭沫若团长等在热烈的掌声中登上主席台。穿着彩衣的朝鲜儿童们登台向志愿军将军们和中国人民代表团人员献花。
    大会在乐队高奏朝中两国国歌声中开始。朝鲜内阁副首相金一在会上致欢送词（全文见第六版）。他说，在最后送别中国人民志愿军官兵的前夕，全体朝鲜人民的心里充满了对八年来同生死共患难的朋友们难舍难分的情意和话不尽的感谢。我以朝鲜人民、劳动党和共和国政府的名义，向光辉地完成了抗美援朝任务的你们表示衷心的感谢和荣誉。他说，兄弟的中国人民志愿军官兵在我们祖国土地上留下的丰功伟绩，将永远长存在我国人民的心里。
    他说，在中国人民志愿军全部从朝鲜北部撤走的今天，美帝国主义不仅不从南朝鲜撤走，而且在为永远占领南朝鲜和加剧紧张局势而垂死挣扎。美帝国主义并进行反对中华人民共和国的挑衅行为，严重威胁远东的局势。
    金一说，如果美国侵略者忘记了在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的历史教训，无视朝中两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的严重警告和抗议，继续进行侵略策划，硬走发动战争的危险道路的话，那么，他就避免不了比朝鲜战争更加惨重的失败。
    金一副首相的讲话在雷动般的掌声中结束后，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱把朝鲜各界人民六百八十四万七千四百三十九人签名的致中国人民志愿军和中国人民的感谢信和签名册，交给了中国人民代表团团长郭沫若和志愿军司令员杨勇上将。朴正爱副委员长说：“今天，和亲爱的你们作别的时候，我以全朝鲜人民的名义向你们，并通过你们向伟大的中国人民和英雄的中国人民志愿军转达凝结着我们深厚心意的感谢信，转达朝鲜人民对他们的深厚友情和感谢。”接着，朴正爱副委员长代表朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会、共和国内阁、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会，朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会委员长李松云代表平壤市劳动人民，分别向志愿军全体官兵赠送了锦旗。
    杨勇上将在热烈的掌声中致答词（全文见第六版）。他首先代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵向八年来热情关怀和爱护志愿军的英雄的朝鲜人民表示衷心感谢和崇高敬意。
    杨勇上将阐述朝中人民反对美国侵略的伟大胜利并严厉谴责美国侵略者赖在南朝鲜不走和不断在我国台湾海峡地区进行战争挑衅。他说，美国强盗如果硬要把战争强加在中朝人民头上，那么，它必将遭到更可耻的失败。
    杨勇上将说，志愿军撤出朝鲜这种对和平的巨大努力，并不意味着中国人民放弃了对兄弟般的邻邦——朝鲜人民的国际主义义务。在我们撤出朝鲜之后，留在朝鲜军事停战委员会内的中国人民志愿军代表，仍将同朝鲜人民军代表一道，继续执行监督朝鲜停战协定实施的任务。我们坚信，无论是武打，还是文打，帝国主义终究是死路一条。我们的正义事业必然胜利。
    杨勇上将的讲话不断获得热烈的掌声。接着，中国人民志愿军政治委员王平上将把志愿军全体官兵签名的致朝鲜人民的告别信和签名册交给朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健。王平上将说：“我们军队撤出了，但是，中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万古长青，我们的心永远在一起。”
    随后，杨勇上将代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵，向朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会、共和国内阁、朝鲜劳动党中央委员会赠送了锦旗；王平上将代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵向平壤市人民委员会、朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会赠送了锦旗。
    大会在国际歌歌声中结束。
    参加今天欢送大会的有：朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健，内阁副首相洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴金哲、金昌满，内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长，民族保卫相金光侠大将和朝鲜人民军高级将领，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，各界著名人士等。
    中国人民志愿军副政治委员梁必业中将、参谋长王蕴瑞少将和志愿军总部的将军们、官兵代表共四百五十多人参加了今天的大会。
    中国人民代表团的全体成员、中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和各国驻朝使节参加了大会。
    会后，朝鲜各著名艺术团体进行了综合演出。
