According to the "New York Times" of September 27, letters from the American public to the U.S. State Department regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait area are constantly increasing, "These letters strongly oppose the government's decision to help the Chinese Nationalists hold on to the coastal islands." One U.S. State Department official revealed that the State Department has recently received more than 5,000 letters, of which 80% "directly criticize the government's policies or express concern that such policies will lead to war."

At the same time, the American Gallup poll also conducted a survey, and the results proved that 91% of Americans do not want the United States to "further militarily involve itself in a war caused by Jinmen and Mazu."

These news items "shocked" U.S. Vice President Nixon. He came out to speak on the same day that the "New York Times" published these news items. Nixon said that it "is constructive and beneficial" for the people to express their opinions to their elected representatives through letters or other means. However, he immediately scolded the State Department official who revealed the opinions of the voters. Nixon believed that the subordinate of the State Department was "deliberately" "making trouble with the Secretary of State and undermining his policies." How strange! A second ago, these voters' opinions were still "constructive," but once they were relayed by a subordinate of the State Department, they became destructive! Since the State Department subordinate who relayed the voters' opinions was deliberately "making trouble with the Secretary of State," wouldn't the thousands of voters who directly wrote to the State Department be even more deliberately "making trouble with the Secretary of State"? Nixon was scolding one to warn another, obviously wanting to suppress the voices of the American people.

Nixon himself also admitted that what he was worried about was not just that one State Department official was not disciplined, but that he was worried that someone would think that the large number of letters from the people should become the decisive factor in determining U.S. foreign policy. So Nixon quickly declared that he firmly opposed this view. He said that the opinions of voters "must not be regarded as the decisive factor in determining policy direction"! Not only that, "if we indulge in the idea that foreign policy decisions should be made based on public opinion polls," then it would be equivalent to "handing over our world leadership to the Communists and becoming a second-rate country." Look, what a big "crime"! In this way, those who "indulge" in public opinion seem to no longer dare to "indulge," otherwise the "Un-American Activities Committee" might visit them?

However, there are two questions here: First, respecting public opinion is originally stipulated in the American "Declaration of Independence" and the American Constitution. The "Declaration of Independence" says that the power of the government "comes from the consent of the governed," and the government should "act according to the opinions of the people." So, isn't Nixon deliberately mocking the "Declaration of Independence" and the American Constitution now? Second, U.S. rulers, including Nixon himself, have always "indulged" in promoting American "democracy," but Nixon has revealed the secret of this "democracy" in one sentence. Isn't this making "trouble" with himself?

In order to persuade those who advocate respecting public opinion, Nixon also talked about a personal experience. Nixon said that when he was a member of the House of Representatives from California, "a large part" of the letters from his constituency opposed the Truman Doctrine and foreign aid programs. However, "a large majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate approved these programs" (needless to say, Nixon himself belonged to this "majority"). So Nixon became complacent: You see, although most voters oppose it, most members of Congress approve it anyway. How wonderful! But, please, Nixon, are these experiences also worth promoting? What else can these experiences prove other than that Nixon (and the "majority" members of Congress like him) shamelessly betrayed their voters and deceived their voters?

Nixon also wanted to explain that the reason why the opinions of the American people and the opinions of the government are always opposed is because the "intelligence" that the people obtain is often wrong. Nixon repeated Eisenhower and Dulles's argument: What is "in danger now is not Jinmen and Mazu, nor Formosa (Taiwan), but the entire free world's position in the Far East." He believed that "when the American people realize this, they will support the resolute attitude taken by the President." However, Nixon's explanation made people even more confused. Why is the "free world's position in the Far East" tied to a few small islands in China's inland sea? Why do Americans have to travel thousands of miles to risk their lives for "defending" Chinese territory? Are Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan American territory? Where did this "intelligence" come from?

In fact, despite the fact that Eisenhower and Dulles are shouting every day about what "danger" the United States has encountered, demanding that the American people support their provocative actions against the Chinese people, the American people's suspicion and opposition to this policy are increasing day by day. The State Department official who deliberately "made trouble with the Secretary of State" also provided an important piece of information, saying: "Most of the letters about the Jinmen situation were received in the two weeks after President Eisenhower explained the importance of the issue and the government's determination to prevent the Communists from seizing these islands in a (September 11) national television speech." This further proves that Eisenhower's speech not only did not answer the questions raised by world public opinion to the United States, but also did not answer the questions raised by the American people to the American government. It was a complete failure.

Now, even in the U.S. Congress, where Nixon is most proud of, some people have expressed disapproval of the U.S. government's provocative policies. Democratic Senator Morse said on September 26, "According to international law, we have no right to interfere in Jinmen and Mazu. If we are militarily involved there, we will become an aggressor nation." As for within the United States, even Associated Press news commentator Ryan could not help but point out: "At present, most of world public opinion seems to believe that the U.S. position on the entire coastal island issue is hopelessly untenable. Many allies also believe that U.S. support for Chiang Kai-shek's dream of recovering the mainland is a constant and growing threat to peace in Asia and the world." Even within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, serious differences have arisen over U.S. policy in the Far East. Isn't Dulles's cry on September 27 at the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to "strengthen unity" a good proof?

The "Dulles policy," which represents the interests of a small group of the most aggressive monopoly capitalist groups, has fallen into a state of being surrounded by enemies. Nixon wanted to help Dulles, but he ended up making things worse. He admitted without being forced that the policies implemented by the U.S. government are not only hostile to the Chinese people and the people of the world, but also fundamentally violate American public opinion. Nixon openly stated that the U.S. government is not prepared to accept the opinions of domestic and foreign public opinion, but is determined to go its own way. But who can this scare? The result is just putting a noose around one's own neck, tightening it more and more, tightening it tighter and tighter, tightening it until it kills!

    在四面楚歌之中
    崔奇
    据9月27日的“纽约时报”报道，美国公众向美国国务院所写的关于台湾海峡地区局势的信件正不断增加，“这些信件强烈反对政府帮助中国国民党守住沿海岛屿的决定”。有一个美国国务院的官员透露说，国务院最近期间收到的来信已达五千多封，其中80％是“直接批评政府的政策，或者表示担心这种政策将导致战争”。
    在这同时，美国盖洛普民意测验所也进行了一次测验，结果证明91％的美国人都不希望美国“在军事上进一步卷入金门和马祖所引起的战争中去”。
    这些消息使美国副总统尼克松“感到震惊”。在“纽约时报”发表这些消息的当天，他就出来讲话了。尼克松说，人民用信件或其他方式向他们选出的代表表示意见，“是建设性的也是有好处的”。但是，他却马上把那个透露了选民意见的国务院官员大骂一通。尼克松认为，那个国务院的下属是“故意”“跟国务卿捣蛋并破坏他的政策”。多么奇怪！在一秒钟以前，这些选民的意见还是“建设性的”，可是一经国务院的下属转述出来，就成了破坏性的！既然转述选民意见的国务院下属是故意“跟国务卿捣蛋”，那么那些直接写信给国务院的成千的选民们，岂不更是故意“跟国务卿捣蛋”吗？尼克松指桑骂槐，显然是想要压制美国人民的呼声。
    尼克松自己也承认，他所担心的倒不是仅仅一个国务院的官员不守纪律，而是担心有人会认为那些大量的人民来信应该成为决定美国外交政策的决定性因素。于是尼克松赶紧声明，他断然反对这种看法。他说，选民的意见“决不能认为是决定政策方针的决定性因素”！不仅这样，“如果我们沉迷在这种想法中，即认为应当根据民意测验作出外交政策的决定”，那么就等于“将我们的世界领导地位交给共产党人并且成为第二流国家”。瞧，多么大的“罪状”啊！这样一来，那些“沉迷”于民意的人们似乎就再也不敢“沉迷”下去了，否则“非美活动委员会”岂不是可以去拜访他们吗？
    不过，这里有两个疑问：第一，尊重民意，本来是美国“独立宣言”和美国宪法所规定的。“独立宣言”说，政府的权力“来自被统治者的同意”，政府应“按照人民的意见”办事。那么，现在尼克松不是在故意嘲笑“独立宣言”和美国宪法吗？第二，美国执政者们，包括尼克松自己，一向“沉迷”于宣扬美国的“民主”，可是尼克松却一语道破了这个“民主”的秘密，这岂不是自己跟自己“捣蛋”吗？
    尼克松为了说服那些主张尊重民意的人们，还讲了他本人的一段经验。尼克松说，当他是众议院的加利福尼亚州的议员时，来自他的选区的信件“有很大一部分”反对杜鲁门主义和援外计划。但是，“在众议院和参议院中却获得了赞成这些计划的很大的多数”（不消说，尼克松本人是属于这个“多数”的）。于是尼克松就洋洋得意起来：你们看，大多数选民尽管反对，大多数议员却尽管赞成，这是多么奥妙！可是，请问尼克松，难道这些经验也是值得宣扬的吗？这些经验除了证明尼克松（还有同他一样的“多数”议员们）可耻地背叛了他们的选民，欺骗了他们的选民以外，还能证明什么呢？
    尼克松还想解释，美国人民的意见和政府的意见所以总是对立，这是因为人民所获得的“情报”往往是错误的。尼克松重复着艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的论调说：现在“处于危险中的不是金门和马祖，也不是福摩萨（台湾），而是整个自由世界在远东的地位”。他相信，“当美国人民认识到这一点的时候，他们就将支持总统所采取的坚决态度”。但是，尼克松的解释却使人更加糊涂起来。为什么“自由世界在远东的地位”是系在中国大陆内海里的几个小岛上呢？为什么美国人要到万里之外，为“保卫”中国的领土而冒险呢？难道金门、马祖和台湾是美国的领土吗？这是从哪里得来的“情报”？
    事实上，尽管艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯天天在叫喊美国遭到了什么“危险”，要求美国人民支持他们对中国人民的挑衅行动，但是美国人民怀疑和反对这种政策的却一天比一天多起来。那位故意“跟国务卿捣蛋”的国务院官员还提供了一个重要材料，他说：“关于金门局势的大多数信件都是在艾森豪威尔总统在（9月11日）全国电视演说中说明问题的重要性和政府阻止共产党夺取这些岛屿的决心以后的两个星期内收到的”。这就更加证明了，艾森豪威尔的演说不但没有回答全世界舆论对美国提出的质问，而且也没有回答美国人民对美国政府所提出的质问，它是完完全全破产了。
    现在，即使在尼克松最为得意的美国国会里，也有人表示不赞成美国政府的挑衅政策。民主党参议员莫尔斯在9月26日说，“根据国际法，我们没有任何权利过问金门和马祖，如果在军事上我们牵连在那里的话，我们将成为一个侵略的国家”。至于在美国国内，连美联社新闻评论员瑞安也不能不指出：“目前大部分世界舆论看来是认为美国在整个沿海岛屿问题上的立场是毫无希望地站不住脚的。许多盟国也认为美国支持蒋介石收复大陆的梦想是对亚洲和世界和平的一个经常的日益增长的威胁。”甚至在北大西洋集团内部，对美国在远东的政策也发生严重分歧，杜勒斯9月27日在北大西洋公约协会的会议上大声疾呼“加强团结”，这不就是一个很好的证明吗？
    代表一小撮最富于侵略性的垄断资本集团利益的“杜勒斯政策”，已经陷于四面楚歌之中。尼克松想要帮杜勒斯的忙，结果却是帮了一个倒忙。他不打自招，承认美国政府所执行的政策不但是与中国人民和世界人民为敌的，而且也是根本违背美国民意的。尼克松公然表示，美国政府不准备接受国内外舆论的意见，而决心一意孤行。但这又能吓倒谁呢？其结果不过是自套绞索，越套越多，越套越紧，越套越死而已！
