    New Developments in Azerbaijani Song and Dance Art
    ——Watching the Performance of the Soviet Azerbaijan National Song and Dance Ensemble

    In the work of developing national folk song and dance art, there are two erroneous attitudes that we are constantly vigilant against. One is to treat national folk art with a bourgeois national nihilistic attitude. These people do not respect national folk art in their work, and they rudely violate the laws of national folk art in the process of sorting and processing, and they are seriously out of touch with the masses. The other erroneous attitude is just the opposite. They treat national folk art with a conservative eye, dare not change it at all, and are satisfied with the current situation and are unwilling to change and develop it. This is essentially a manifestation of a bourgeois narrow nationalist viewpoint. We have been fighting against these two erroneous attitudes all along. After seeing the outstanding performance of the Soviet Azerbaijan National Song and Dance Ensemble, I feel that our direction of struggle is clearer. The road they have traveled under the leadership of the Soviet regime for more than 20 years since the establishment of the troupe in 1936, and the tremendous achievements they have made in sorting out and developing Azerbaijani national song and dance, provide us with valuable experience.

    The Azerbaijani people have created highly distinctive folk songs and dances, but only in the Soviet era have these folk songs and dances been respected and greatly developed. These achievements are inseparable from the work of the artists of this song and dance troupe. From their brilliant performances, we deeply felt the various precious characteristics of Azerbaijani traditional national songs and dances on the one hand; on the other hand, we also felt the significant and profound changes that have taken place on this deep tradition. The two are combined so naturally, without any imposed artificial traces.

    The establishment of Azerbaijani choral art is a vivid example. The folk songs of this nation have a profound popular character in content; in music, they have very charming melodies, special modes, and distinct and rich rhythms; in singing, the sound is solid and pure, and there is also outstanding expressiveness in mastering the characteristics of the language. The artists of the song and dance troupe have preserved all these advantages in choral art. In terms of content, they not only perform ancient and moving folk songs, but also sing a large number of revolutionary songs and songs reflecting socialist construction, enriching the field of ideological content and promoting the development of artistic expressiveness. In music, the artists also carefully studied the traditional songs word by word and sentence by sentence, striving to express the Azerbaijani folk music's color, rhythm, style, and the unique points of its melody and mode system. At the same time, they also used polyphonic techniques with extraordinary ingenuity on the basis of these characteristics to develop into multi-part choruses. None of these choruses are without creativity. It breaks the flat impression of European classical harmony and appears exquisite and colorful. This time, only twenty-seven artists came with the choir of the song and dance troupe, but they have amazing expressiveness. On the one hand, they maintain many characteristics of folk singing, especially in the solid and bright sound and the expressiveness of mastering the language, with a clear folk style; at the same time, they also have many complex expressive techniques that choral art should have. They never relax in using these techniques to increase the vitality of the song in the handling of the song, especially in the contrast between strength and weakness and the singing of weak musical phrases, which greatly increases the lyricism of the song and the charm in the performance. Songs such as "A Little Flower," "You, My Beauty," "Oh, Look at Me," "Ah, Grandmother," "Motherland Suite," and "I Support Peace" are all songs that you never get tired of listening to.

    The national orchestra of the song and dance troupe is also very attractive. This orchestra has only two bowed stringed instruments, four plucked stringed instruments, two wind instruments, a bayan, and two hand drums. These eleven purely Azerbaijani folk instruments have great charm. They have become a very important part of this artistic whole with a distinct national style in both accompaniment to dance and accompaniment to singing. This orchestra has the characteristics of Eastern Asian music, and the playing methods of many instruments are also familiar to us.

    Here, we should also mention the great role of this choir and orchestra in the dance performances of the song and dance troupe. It seems that the combination of choral art and dance is the greatest feature of this song and dance troupe. The choir and orchestra stand on the stage almost from beginning to end, and most of the dances are accompanied by a chorus. The singing conveys a clear idea of the content of the dance and increases the human touch of the dance. After all, the human voice is the most emotionally charming means of expression in music. Whether in fierce male dance or gentle female dance, the singing can accurately convey the strong rhythm or delicate lyricism required by the dance. This combined form of performance is also worthy of our attention.

    Azerbaijani national dance also has a very unique style and a high level of expressive skill. The vigor and flexibility of male dance is amazing. The leg skills of male dancers are as agile as flying birds and as fast as a whirlwind. Many male dances, such as "Shepherd's Dance," "Geda Gayi," and "Sheki-Lekzinka Dance," have a richer atmosphere of life. Female dances such as "Plate Dance" and "Lyrical Dance" are also very characteristic. The theme of "Veil Dance" is also very touching. In addition to many ancient dances that reflect historical customs, labor processes, majestic emotions, and the romanticism of love, we should also pay special attention to some new dances that have emerged in socialist reality, such as "Oil Workers' Dance" and "Youth Dance." The artistic quality of these dances is no less than that of traditional dances, and they have a stronger sense of the times, reflecting the vigorous spirit of Azerbaijani Soviet youth.

    The performance of the Soviet Azerbaijan National Song and Dance Ensemble shows that only under the socialist system and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism can the culture and art of all ethnic groups truly prosper. The artistic experience of the Soviet Azerbaijan National Song and Dance Ensemble for more than 20 years is worthy of our serious study.

    阿塞拜疆歌舞艺术的新发展
    ——看苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团演出
    叶林
    在发展民族民间歌舞艺术的工作中，有两种错误的态度经常为我们所警惕。一种是以资产阶级民族虚无主义的态度来对待民族民间艺术。这些人在从事民族民间艺术的工作中不尊重民族民间艺术，在整理加工过程中粗暴地违反民族民间艺术的规律，严重地脱离群众。另一种错误的态度则恰恰相反，他们用保守的眼光来对待民族民间艺术，不敢更动一毫一发，并且满足于当前的状况，不愿去改变和发展它。这实质上也是一种资产阶级狭隘民族主义观点的表现。对待这两种错误的态度，我们是一直在进行着斗争的。当我们看到了苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团卓越的演出以后，我觉得我们斗争的方向是更加明确了。他们自1936年建团的时候起，二十多年来在苏维埃政权的领导下所走过的道路，在整理与发展阿塞拜疆民族歌舞方面所作出的巨大成绩，正好给我们提供了宝贵的经验。
    阿塞拜疆人民创造了极有特色的民间歌舞，但是，只有在苏维埃时代里，这些民间歌舞才得到尊重，并有了很大的发展。这些成绩是和这个歌舞团的艺术家们的工作分不开的。从他们的精采演出中，我们一方面深切地感到了阿塞拜疆传统民族歌舞的各种珍贵的特色；另一方面，也感到了在这深厚的传统的基础上所发生的显著而深刻的变化。这两者是结合得如此自然，没有任何强加的人工的痕迹。
    阿塞拜疆合唱艺术的建立就是一个鲜明的例子。这个民族的民歌在内容上具有深刻的人民性；在音乐上则有着非常迷人的曲调、特殊的调式、鲜明而丰富的节奏；在唱法上声音坚实而纯净，在掌握语言特点的方面也有着杰出的表现力。歌舞团的艺术家们在合唱艺术中把这一切优点都保存下来了。他们在内容上不仅演出古老的动人的民歌，而且还唱出了大量的革命歌曲和反映社会主义建设的歌曲，丰富了思想内容的领域，并推动了艺术表现力的发展。在音乐上，艺术家们也仔细地对传统歌曲进行了逐字逐句的研究，力求表达阿塞拜疆民间音乐的色采、节奏、风格及其曲调和调式体系的独特之点。同时，并异常精巧地在这些特点的基础上用复调手法处理、发展成为多声部的合唱。在这些合唱中，没有一首不是具有创造性的，它打破了欧洲古典和声的平板印象，显得精巧而色采鲜明。这个歌舞团的合唱队这次只来了二十七位艺术家，但是他们却具有惊人的表现力，一方面保持了民间唱法的许多特点，特别是在声音的坚实明亮和掌握语言的表现力方面，带有着明显的民间风格；同时，他们又具有了合唱艺术所应有的许多复杂表现技巧，在歌曲的处理上从不放松运用这些技巧来增加歌曲的生命力，特别是在强弱对比和弱音乐句的演唱方面，大大地增加了歌曲的抒情性和演唱中的魅力。像“一朵小花”“你呵，我的美人儿”“呵，看我一眼吧”“啊，老祖母”“祖国组曲”以及“我拥护和平”等歌曲，都是百听不厌的。
    歌舞团的民族乐队也是十分吸引人的，这个乐队只有两件拉弦乐器，四件拨弹乐器，两支管，一具巴扬和两具手鼓。这十一件纯粹是阿塞拜疆的民间乐器却有着很大的魅力，无论在伴舞和伴唱中都成为这个艺术整体中非常重要的具有鲜明民族风格的部分。这个乐队具有东方亚洲音乐的特点，许多乐器的演奏方法对我们来说也是亲切的。
    这里，还应该提到这个合唱队和乐队在歌舞团舞蹈表演中的巨大作用。看来，合唱艺术和舞蹈的结合，是这个歌舞团的最大特色。合唱队和乐队自始至终几乎都站在台上，绝大部分的舞蹈都有合唱伴随。歌声为舞蹈的内容传达了明确的思想，增加了舞蹈的人情味。人声毕竟是音乐中最富有感情魅力的表现手段，无论在狂烈的男性舞或是在温文的女性舞蹈中，歌声都能够准确地传达出舞蹈所需要的强烈的节奏或细致的抒情。这种结合的表演形式也值得我们重视。
    阿塞拜疆的民族舞蹈同样具有非常独特的风格和高度的表现技巧。男性舞蹈的矫健与灵活是惊人的，男演员的腿部技巧敏捷得有如飞鸟，快似旋风。好些男性舞蹈如“牧人舞”、“盖达给”和“谢纪—列克细舞”等，更具有丰富的生活气息。女性舞蹈如“盘子舞”、“抒情舞”等也很有特点，“面纱舞”的主题也是很感人的。除了许多反映历史习俗、劳动过程、威武的情绪和爱情的浪曼谛克的古代舞蹈以外，还应该特别提出一些在社会主义现实生活中产生的新舞蹈，如“石油工人舞”、“青年舞”等，这些舞蹈的艺术质量和传统的舞蹈相比，毫不感到逊色，并且具有更为强烈的时代感，反映出阿塞拜疆苏维埃青年的蓬勃朝气。
    苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团的演出，说明了只有在社会主义制度和马克思列宁主义思想指导下，各族人民的文化艺术才能得到真正的繁荣。苏联阿塞拜疆国家歌舞团二十多年来的艺术经验，是值得我们认真学习的。
