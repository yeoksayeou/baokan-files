Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, October 24th. The recent on-site conference on desert greening in ten provinces and regions held in Lanzhou officially declared war on China's 1.6 billion mu of desert. Representatives from the ten provinces and regions, based on the size of the local desert area, and with the revolutionary spirit of communism, formulated one- to seven-year plans for desert control. They are determined, under the strong leadership of the Party, to mobilize the masses to complete the heroic feat of transforming the desert, utilizing the desert, and conquering the desert.

The conference began on the 6th and ended on the 19th. Representatives from ten provinces and regions, including Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Hebei, attended. They visited advanced areas in desert greening, such as the Yulin Special Zone in northern Shaanxi. Through full exchanges of desert control experiences, the representatives recognized the necessity and possibility of eliminating deserts.

The conference believes that in the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people along the wind and sand line have made great achievements and gained preliminary experience in transforming the desert. Advanced banners of desert control have emerged, such as Minqin County in Gansu and Hailiutan in Yulin and Liuguiwan in Jingbian, Shaanxi. The dozens of desert control methods created in these areas, such as biological sand fixation, water diversion for desert control, and engineering management, have played a significant role in preventing wind and fixing sand, expanding farmland, increasing grain production, and changing the climate.

The conference pointed out that China's deserts are mainly concentrated in the above-mentioned ten provinces and regions, especially in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia. The desert area in Xinjiang is about 825 million mu, accounting for half of the total desert area in the country. The biggest characteristics of these deserts are: dry and windy, extremely scarce rainfall, sparse vegetation cover, and drastic temperature changes. This seriously affects the development of industrial and agricultural construction and transportation in these areas, and becomes an important source of various natural disasters.

The conference required that, under the guidance of the policy of resolutely, rapidly, thoroughly, and comprehensively eliminating deserts, desert control work should be mainly undertaken by the communes, supplemented by state-owned enterprises; comprehensively planned, and comprehensively managed; grass first, then trees, with equal emphasis on grass and trees. It is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, continuously overcome various right-leaning conservative ideas, and adopt the method of rectification through extensive airing of views, big contending, big debate, and big character posters to remove the white flag on desert control ideology and plant the red flag. The conference also pointed out that in order to subdue the desert, it is necessary to first understand the area, type, characteristics, movement patterns, plant distribution, composition, and mechanical composition of the local desert, and further improve the planning at the county and commune levels. Attention should be paid to combining the elimination of disadvantages with the promotion of advantages, combining transformation and utilization, and combining current interests with long-term interests. It is necessary to immediately start selecting suitable and representative locations, establish experimental research institutions, and promote mass experimental research work. It is necessary to organize communist cooperation between provinces, counties, and communes. It is necessary to use all possible animal power and machinery, especially airplanes, for sowing work.

### 向沙漠宣战  全国十省区制定降伏沙漠的宏伟规划

    向沙漠宣战
    全国十省区制定降伏沙漠的宏伟规划
    新华社兰州24日电　最近在兰州举行的十省区绿化沙漠现场会议，正式向我国境内十六亿亩沙漠提出宣战。十个省、区的代表按照当地沙漠面积的大小，以共产主义的革命气魄，分别制定了一年到七年的治沙规划。他们决心在党的坚强领导下，发动群众完成改造沙漠、利用沙漠、征服沙漠的英雄业绩。
    会议从6日开始到19日结束，出席的有新疆、青海、甘肃、宁夏、陕西、内蒙古、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河北等十省、区的代表。他们参观了陕北榆林专区等绿化沙漠的先进地区，代表们通过充分地交流了治沙经验，从而认识到消灭沙漠的必要性和可能性。
    会议认为，过去几年，风沙线上的人民群众在党和政府的领导下，改造沙漠工作已经取得很大成绩和初步经验，出现了像甘肃民勤县和陕西榆林的海流滩、靖边的柳桂湾等治沙先进旗帜。这些地区创造的生物固沙、引水治沙和工程治理等几十种治沙方法，对于防风固沙、扩大农田、增产粮食、改变气候已起到显著作用。
    会议指出，我国沙漠主要集中在上述十个省、区，尤以新疆、青海、甘肃、宁夏、陕西和内蒙古为最多。新疆沙漠面积约有八万二千五百万亩，占全国沙漠总面积的一半。这些沙漠的最大特点是：干燥多风，雨量奇缺，植物被复稀少，气温变化剧烈。这就严重地影响到这些地区工农业建设和交通运输事业的发展，成为各种自然灾害的重要根源。
    会议要求各地在坚决、迅速、彻底、全面消灭沙漠的方针指导下，治沙工作应以社办为主，国营为辅；全面规划，综合治理；先草后木，草木并重。必须放手发动群众，不断克服各种右倾保守思想，采取大鸣大放大争大辩的整风办法，拔掉治沙思想上的白旗，插上红旗。会议同时指出，要想制伏沙漠，必先摸清当地沙漠的面积、类型、特点、移动规律、植物分布及其成分和机械组成，进一步搞好县、社的层层规划。注意把除弊和兴利结合起来，改造和利用结合起来，目前利益和长远利益结合起来。要立即着手选择适宜的有代表性的地点，建立试验研究机构，推动群众性的试验研究工作。要组织省与省、县与县、社与社之间的共产主义大协作。要利用一切可能利用的畜力和机械，特别是飞机进行播种工作。（附图片）
