By our correspondent Pan Fei, London, 7th. Disregarding the strong opposition of the Greek people, Macmillan "auspiciously" implemented his Cyprus "New Plan," putting it into effect on October 1st. Before a week had passed – specifically, starting on the evening of the 3rd and continuing to the present – British troops in Cyprus began large-scale arrests and brutal massacres. Not long ago, the British Prime Minister boasted greatly about this plan, saying it would bring "peace and stability" to Cyprus. Now, it's all real swords and guns, and the colonialists' true colors are exposed.

The British colonialists' acts of terror are carried out under the pretext that the wife of a British soldier was assassinated in Famagusta, Cyprus, on October 3rd. The British government is responsible for this incident, as it is the consequence of the British government's colonial policies. If we are really going to settle accounts, haven't the British colonialists already owed the Cypriot people enough blood debts? However, the British Conservative government is using this incident to make a big fuss, giving the Cypriot people a "stern warning," attempting to pave the way for the "New Plan."

The cruelty and barbarity of the colonialists can be seen even in the British bourgeois newspapers. The "Times" wrote on the 6th: "It is very obvious that the searching troops are dominated by strong anger. When arresting Cypriots, there is not even a pretense of politeness." The "Observer" reporter reported: "Today, Famagusta is a city in distress, licking its wounds behind closed doors and windows. Only armed soldiers are on the sunny streets." When mentioning the actions on the night of the 3rd, this reporter euphemistically (but after all, revealing a bit of the truth) made the following description: "The British troops who were sent to reinforce the curfew and arrest suspects lost control for an hour, so it is certainly difficult to clarify things." According to the Cyprus British authorities, as of the 5th, in Famagusta alone, 650 Greek residents had been arrested, and 250 had been injured. Three people died, including a girl who was only thirteen years old. On the 6th, British troops continued to expand their terror activities, arresting more than 200 people in Kalmi.

However, it is very clear that the forced implementation of the "New Plan" has precisely received the opposite result from what the British government expected. The situation created by the colonialists' atrocities has doomed this plan to failure. The fire of revenge is burning everywhere, and attacks on British troops are increasing daily.

The British government's new plan not only deepened the opposition between local Greek residents and the British authorities in Cyprus but also aroused fierce opposition from the Greek government, creating an unprecedentedly tense relationship between Britain and Greece. According to the British "New Plan," the Turkish government has appointed its consul-general in Cyprus as a "consultative representative" to "assist" the British Governor. This makes the Cyprus issue even more complicated. The Greek government has stated that if the current NATO Council discussion on the Cyprus issue does not yield results, Greece will withdraw all its representatives from the organization and sever diplomatic relations with Britain. Even the extreme right-wing "Daily Telegraph" had to lament: The implementation of the Cyprus "New Plan" only resulted in the sign in front of the Turkish Consul General's office being changed to "Turkish Consultative Representative" - that's all that happened!

### 英国殖民者狂施血腥镇压  塞浦路斯燃起复仇怒火

    英国殖民者狂施血腥镇压
    塞浦路斯燃起复仇怒火
    本报记者潘非7日伦敦电　不顾希腊人民的强烈反对，麦克米伦为他的塞浦路斯“新计划”“择吉开张”，在10月1日付诸实施。未及一个星期——确切地说，是从3日晚间开始，一直持续到现在——英国军队在塞浦路斯就开始了大规模的逮捕和残酷的屠杀。不久以前，英国首相为这个计划大事吹嘘，说它能为塞浦路斯带来“和平和安定”。现在是：真刀真枪全武行，殖民主义者的面目暴露无遗。
    英国殖民者的恐怖活动，是在这样的借口下进行的：一个英国士兵的妻子，10月3日在塞浦路斯的法马古斯大被暗杀。对于这一事件要负责任的，是英国政府，因为这是英国政府殖民政策的后果。如果真的要算账的话，那么英国殖民者对塞浦路斯人民欠下的血债，难道还算少吗？但是，英国的保守党政府却利用这一事件，大动干戈，对塞浦路斯人民来个“下马威”，企图为“新计划”开道。
    殖民主义者的凶残和狂暴，即使根据英国资产阶级报纸，也可以看出达到了什么样的程度。6日的“泰晤士报”写道：“进行搜查的军队为强烈的激怒所支配，这是很明显的。在逮捕塞浦路斯人的时候，连做作的文雅也没有。”“观察家报”的记者是这样报道的：“今天，法马古斯大是一个遭了难的城市，紧闭着窗门在那里舐着自己的创伤。在阳光照射着的大街上只有带枪的兵士。”在提到3日夜间的行动时，这个记者委婉地（但是毕竟透露了一点真实情况）作了如下的叙述：“被派遣去增强宵禁、逮捕嫌疑犯的英国军队，失去控制达一小时，所以要把事情搞清楚当然很难。”根据塞浦路斯英国当局公布，到5日为止，仅在法马古斯大一地，被逮捕的希腊居民达六百五十人，被打伤的有二百五十人。死亡的有三人，其中有年仅十三岁的女孩。6日，英国军队继续扩大恐怖活动，在卡尔米一地又逮捕了二百余人。
    但是，事情却十分清楚，“新计划”的强制实施，恰恰收到了与英国政府的期望截然相反的结果。殖民者的暴行所造成的局势，注定了这个计划必然失败。复仇的怒火正在各地燃烧起来，对英国军队的袭击事件，正与日俱增。
    英国政府的新计划不仅在塞浦路斯加深了当地希腊居民同英国当局之间的对立，而且引起了希腊政府的激烈反对，使英希两国之间的关系出现了从未有过的紧张局面。根据英国“新计划”的规定，土耳其政府已任命它驻在塞浦路斯的总领事，成为“协助”英国总督的“协商代表”。这就使得塞浦路斯问题更加复杂化。希腊政府已经表示，如果目前正在举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会对塞浦路斯问题的讨论没有结果，希腊将撤回在这个组织中的一切代表，并且和英国断绝外交关系。连极右派的“每日电讯报”也不得不悲叹：塞浦路斯“新计划”的实施，只是使土耳其总领事办公室门前的牌子，改成“土耳其协商代表”的牌子——这就是所发生的一切！（附图片）
