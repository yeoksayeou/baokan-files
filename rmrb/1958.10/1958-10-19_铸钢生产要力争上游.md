Steel casting production is the vanguard of the machinery manufacturing industry. In the nationwide battle for steel, a large number of steel castings are needed for many smelting equipment, lifting and transportation equipment, and other heavy machinery. At the same time, steel casting output itself is a component of steel output. Therefore, some say that steel casting production plays two roles: it is not only a vital force for the Marshal of Steel, but also a pioneer for the Marshal of Machinery.

However, the current situation where steel casting production cannot meet the demand is very serious. It is natural that the two Marshals, Steel and Machinery, are advancing by leaps and bounds like heavenly horses, bringing temporary imbalances to the link of steel casting production. The question is how steel casting production can catch up quickly. There are different views on this issue. There used to be a view that the steel casting production process is complicated, the production cycle is long, the technical requirements are high, and the factory buildings and equipment must have certain conditions. In particular, most of the steel castings made in the past were small and medium-sized pieces. Now, metallurgical equipment and mining equipment not only require a large number, but also the castings are heavy. Although there is potential for increased production, it is somewhat demanding to increase the output several times on the original basis. Just as some people in agricultural production thought that wheat was a low-yield crop some time ago, some people in industrial production also think that steel casting is also a "low-yield crop," and it is difficult to imagine high-yield harvests. Therefore, when it comes to increasing steel casting production, they immediately consider basic construction and adding new equipment.

However, the workers of the Shanghai Zhongzhu Steel Plant used their creative labor to break this superstition. The monthly output growth rate, monthly output per unit molding area, and monthly output per molding worker of this factory are far ahead of dozens of steel casting workshops in the country. At present, the unit molding area output of steel casting production in the country is generally between 0.4 and 0.6 tons, and there are not many factories that exceed 0.8 tons. However, the unit molding area output of Shanghai Zhongzhu Plant in September was as high as 1.93 tons, which is three or four times higher than the general level. The quality can still be maintained at the past level, and the cost is greatly reduced. The planned output of this factory in October is striving to reach 2,200 tons, which will be doubled again compared with September.

Perhaps some people will say that the conditions of this factory must be particularly good, the technical force is strong, and the products are simple and the batches are large. That's not the case. This is a small joint state-private enterprise. After the expansion this year, it covers an area of ​​only a dozen acres, the molding area is only 576 square meters, the equipment conditions are poor, and the technical force is not strong. There is not even an engineer. It produces steel castings for various smelting equipment, with many patterns and small batches. Condition theorists should have nothing to say.

The most fundamental reason why this factory can create high-yield results is that the leaders of this factory have implemented putting politics in command in all their work, and ideological work has been carried out in a thorough and meticulous manner, turning the state's tasks into the conscious actions of every employee, extensively mobilizing the masses, and letting everyone speak out freely. Those cadres who lacked enthusiasm and confidence were first criticized and thoroughly reformed; the "condition theory," the "production ceiling theory," and the tendencies of pride and complacency that had just emerged, and the tendency to bow to difficulties were resolutely criticized and repeatedly educated. They were organized to visit fraternal factories to learn from advanced experience. In this way, the cadres and the masses inserted red flags in their thinking, their enthusiasm was soaring, and they made great efforts in technical revolution. The leadership promptly grasped and solved weak links one by one, adjusted the labor organization, strengthened the production technical preparation work, arranged the process routes, and adopted a series of technical innovation measures. In this way, production upsurges appeared one after another, and the output doubled again and again.

A small factory can make a leap forward in steel casting production and be far ahead in the country. This matter is worthy of everyone's deep thinking, especially large factories. The nation's heavy machinery factories should do the math. If these factories can reach half of the unit area output level of the Zhongzhu factory this year, how many tons of steel castings will the country increase, and how much more metallurgical equipment and heavy machinery will be manufactured? The national locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing and repair plants should also seriously think about it. These plants all have steel casting workshops capable of mass production. In this regard, the conditions are much better than many plants. Why is the unit area output of the best plant only half of that of the Zhongzhu plant? If it can reach or exceed one ton this year, how many more locomotives and rolling stock will the country produce? Some newly built and foreign-designed new factories should think even more. These factories have unique advantages and the best material conditions. Mechanized workshops should speed up and catch up quickly, and there should be a greater leap forward. All factories in the country that have steel casting production should, without exception, strive for the top and resolutely eliminate the harmful thinking of being content with being in the middle.

The experience of Shanghai Zhongzhu Plant once again proves that in our era, when the role of people is earnestly brought into play, miracles can be created. Conditions are created and used by people, and equipment is operated by people. Do a good job in people's work, emancipate the mind, give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the masses, and strive to tap potential and carry out technical reforms. The steel casting high-yield red flag can completely fly all over the steel casting workshops across the country.

### 铸钢生产要力争上游

    铸钢生产要力争上游
    铸钢生产是机械制造工业的先锋。在为钢而战的全民战斗中，许多冶炼设备、起重运输设备以及其他许多重型机器都需要大量的铸钢件。同时，铸钢产量本身又是钢产量的一个组成部分，因此，有人说铸钢生产身兼二任，既是钢铁元帅的生力军，又是机械元帅的先行官。
    可是，目前铸钢产量不能满足需要的情况十分严重。钢铁机械两大元帅如天马行空，飞跃前进，给铸钢生产这一环节带来暂时的不平衡，这是很自然的事。问题在于铸钢生产如何快马加鞭赶上去。关于这个问题，是存在着不同的看法的。曾经流传这样一种看法：认为铸钢生产过程复杂，生产周期长，技术要求高，厂房和设备都要有一定的条件，特别是过去做的铸钢件大多数是中小件：现在冶金设备矿山设备不仅数量要求多，而且铸件重量大，虽然增产有潜力，但是要在原有的基础上，产量翻几番，未免有些强人所难。正如前些时候在农业生产方面有人认为小麦是低产作物一样，目前工业生产方面也有人认为铸钢也是“低产作物”，要高额丰产是很难想像的。因此，谈到铸钢增产马上就考虑基本建设，增加新设备。
    但是，上海中铸钢铁厂的职工同志们就用自己的创造性的劳动打破了这种迷信。这个厂的月产量增长百分比、单位造型面积月产量、每一造型工月产量等几个指标在全国几十个铸钢车间中遥遥领先。目前全国铸钢生产的单位造型面积产量，一般的都在○点四到○点六吨之间，超过○点八吨的没有几个厂。可是上海中铸厂9月份的单位造型面积产量高达一点九三吨，比一般水平超出三四倍，质量仍能保持过去的水平，成本还大大降低。这个厂10月份的计划产量争取达到二千二百吨，比9月份又将翻一番。
    也许有人会说，一定是这个厂的条件特别好，技术力量强，产品简单，批量大。事实不然。这是一个小型的公私合营厂，今年扩建以后占地不过十几亩，造型面积只有五百七十六平方公尺，设备条件差，技术力量也不强，一个工程师也没有，生产的是各种冶炼设备的铸钢件，花样多、批数小。条件论者应该没话可说了。
    这个厂能创造出高产的成绩，最根本的原因是这个厂的领导上在一切工作中贯彻了政治挂帅，思想工作做得深入细致，把国家任务变成每一个职工的自觉行动，广泛发动群众，大鸣大放；对干劲不足、信心不足的干部首先进行批判，大整大改；对“条件论”“生产到顶论”和才露头的骄傲自满情绪，向困难低头的倾向，坚决地进行批判和反复教育，组织到兄弟厂去参观，学习先进经验。这样，干部和群众思想上插上了红旗，干劲冲天，大闹技术革命。领导上及时地抓紧解决一个个薄弱环节，调整劳动组织，加强生产技术准备工作，安排工艺路线，并采取了一系列的技术革新措施。这样，生产高潮就接二连三的出现，产量一翻再翻。
    一个小厂能够在铸钢生产上跃进，在全国遥遥领先，这件事值得大家深思，特别是大厂。全国重型机器厂应该算一算账，如果这些厂在今年内能达到中铸厂单位面积产量水平的一半，全国将增产多少吨铸钢件，将多制造多少冶金设备和重型机器？全国机车车辆制造厂和修理厂也应该认真地想一想，这些厂都有能够进行大批生产的铸钢车间，在这方面比许多厂的条件好得多，怎么单位面积产量最好的厂也只有中铸厂的一半？如果今年内都能达到或超过一吨的话，全国将多生产多少台机车车辆？一些新建的和国外设计的新厂更应该想一想，这些厂得天独厚，物质条件最优越，机械化车间应该快马加鞭，急起直追，应该有更大的跃进。全国所有有铸钢生产的工厂，都应该毫无例外地力争上游，坚决破除安于中游的有害思想。
    上海中铸厂的经验又一次证明，在我们的时代，人的作用认真发挥起来，就能创造出奇迹。条件是人创造和运用的，设备是人操纵的。做好人的工作，解放思想，发挥群众的主动性、积极性，努力挖掘潜力和进行技术改革，铸钢高产红旗就完全有可能在全国铸钢车间到处飘扬。
