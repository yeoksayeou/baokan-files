I Cook Meals For Everyone
Shen Xuezhi, Cook at the Family Cafeteria of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory

If you want me to talk about the benefits of having cafeterias run by the families of workers, I could go on and on. Just listen to this quick-rhyme that everyone made up!

	The public cafeteria is truly good,
	Saving money, saving coal, spending less than you should,
	In the morning, one person goes to buy food,
	No need for everyone to run around on foot.
	Free up the kitchen for dormitories,
	Save manpower to run factories,
	From now on, life is collectivized,
	Women are completely liberated.

As soon as the cafeteria was established, we housewives were liberated from tedious housework and no longer revolved around the stove all day long. Family members became workers, learning culture, learning technology, and running factories. Whoever has the strength can contribute as much as possible to socialist construction.

Some people asked me, "Everyone else is going to learn technology and run factories, why are you so willing to be a cook at such a young age?"

Some people also ridiculed me, saying, "You used to revolve around the stove, and now you still revolve around the stove. Everyone else is liberated, but are you liberated?" To be honest, I didn't want to be a "stove-revolver" before either. Before the cafeteria was established, I really wanted to be a worker. When I saw women about my age going to factories, learning culture, learning technology, going to work and getting off work every day, I was very envious! I thought to myself that I was only twenty-five years old and already had four children. At home, all I did was cook and take care of the children. When would I be able to jump out of the circle of housework and have something to strive for? I applied twice to take the apprentice exam in the yarn factory, but I didn't pass either time. Later, the families of the workers wanted to run factories, cafeterias, and nurseries so that housewives could participate in labor production. I was overjoyed, thinking that this time I could become a worker. However, I was assigned to be a cook again. I asked several times to be a worker, but I was not allowed. I felt very awkward at the time. Once, I went to the director of the family committee and asked as soon as I met her:

"Why don't you let me be a worker and still let me be a 'stove-revolver'?"

The director smiled and asked me in return, "If no one wants to be a cook, what will we all eat!?"

The director's question left me speechless. I thought to myself that it was true. Someone has to do the work of a cook. Without a cook, the cafeteria couldn't be run, and everyone couldn't escape from housework and participate in social labor. I can't always think only about myself. When I got home, my husband also said, "Work hard! You are different now than before. A cook is also an important job."

Now, I understand. Although I cook at home and also cook in the cafeteria, it's very different from before. Before, I cooked for a few people at home, but now I cook for everyone in the community. More than 300 people eat the food we make comfortably, and they go to work happily. Aren't we also doing something meaningful for socialist construction? In the future, I will also learn the skills of stir-frying well and become a cook who is both red and expert!

### 我为人人做餐饭

    我为人人做餐饭
    郑州纺织机械厂家属食堂炊事员  沈学芝
    要让我说说职工家属办食堂的好处，那真是一天一夜也说不完。你就听听大家编的这首快板吧！
  公共食堂真正好，
  省钱省煤花钱少，
  早晨一人去买菜，
  不用人人把腿跑。
  腾出厨房做宿舍，
  省出人力办工厂，
  从今生活集体化，
  妇女彻底解放了。
    一成立食堂，我们家庭妇女就从繁琐的家务劳动中解放出来，再也不整天围着锅台转了。家属变成了工人，学文化、学技术、办工厂，谁有多大劲就可以为社会主义建设出多大劲。
    有人问我：“人家都去学技术、办工厂，你年轻轻的为啥偏愿意当炊事员呢？”
    也有人讥笑我说：“你从前围着锅台转，现在还是围着锅台转，别人都解放了，你解放了没有？”说实在话，以前我也是不愿意当“锅台转”。成立食堂以前，我很想当工人，看见人家和我年龄差不多的妇女上了工厂，整天学文化、学技术，上班下班，我可眼红啦！我想自己才二十五岁，已经有四个孩子，在家里除了做饭就是看孩子，啥时候才能跳出家务劳动的圈子，有个奔头呢？我有两次报名去考纱厂里的学徒工，都没有考上。后来职工家属们也要办工厂、办食堂、办托儿所，让家庭妇女参加劳动生产，我乐极了，心想这一回可以当工人了。可是，又分配我当炊事员。我几次要求去当工人都没有允许，当时心里很别扭。有一回，我去找家属委员会主任，一见面就问：
    “为啥不让我当工人，还让我当‘锅台转’呢？”
    主任笑着反问我：“都不愿意当炊事员，咱们大伙吃什么啊！？”
    主任这一问，弄得我无言答对。我想也是。这炊事员的工作总要有人做，没有炊事员，食堂就办不成，大家还是不能脱离家务劳动，参加社会劳动，我不能老为自己想。回到家里，我爱人也说：“好好干吧！你现在和以前可不同了，炊事员也是重要工作。”
    现在，我心里可想通了。虽然在家里是做饭，在食堂也是做饭，可是这和以前大不一样。以前在家是做给几个人吃，现在在社里是做给大伙儿吃。我们这个食堂有三百多人吃饭，大家舒舒服服吃了我们做的饭，快快活活地去上工，我们不是也为社会义主建设做了一件有意义的事吗？以后，我还要学好炒菜的技术，也要做又红又专的炊事员呢！
