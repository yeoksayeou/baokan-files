Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 18th: Lingshui and Baoting Counties in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have transformed from historically severe malaria epidemic areas into basically malaria-free regions. This was formally announced by the Hainan and Tongshi Malaria Prevention and Control Stations after recent random inspections and tests.

According to inspections, the malaria incidence rate in Baoting County has dropped from 92% to 1%, and the phenomenon of newborns being affected by malaria has disappeared. In Lingshui County, in the original hyper-endemic stubborn malaria area, the malaria incidence rate and the malaria parasite rate have both decreased significantly. In the Nanqiao, Kongmen, and Tianxin areas where the Li people of this county live, the malaria incidence rate has decreased by more than 90%. In the past, the monthly incidence rate at the Xinglong Farm in Lingshui County was around 50%; it is now controlled below 0.3%.

During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, malaria was severely prevalent in Lingshui and Baoting Counties, and people were unable to seek medical treatment, resulting in a high mortality rate. After liberation, the local Party committees and governments attached great importance to malaria control work. In the early days of liberation, the health departments organized mobile teams to treat people in various malaria epidemic areas; later, they conducted a series of malaria area surveys and anti-malaria research work. In recent years, both counties have established malaria prevention and control stations and mobilized the masses to carry out the "eliminate the four pests" campaign. On the one hand, patients receive systematic treatment. During the peak malaria season from March to August each year, relapse prevention treatment is carried out in various villages, and "666" and other agents are sprayed to vigorously eliminate mosquitoes.

    疟疾严重流行区的新变化
    保亭陵水成为基本无疟县
    新华社广州18日电　海南黎族苗族自治州的陵水、保亭两县，已从一个历史性的疟疾严重流行区变为基本无疟地区。这是海南和通什两个疟疾防治站最近经过抽查检验后正式宣布的。
    据检查证实，保亭县全县的疟疾发病率已由92％下降到1％，新生婴儿受疟疾侵害的现象已经绝迹。在陵水县原属超高度顽固性的疟区，疟疾发病率和疟原虫率都已显著下降。这个县里黎族人民聚居的南桥、空门、田新一带，疟疾发病率降低了90％以上。陵水县兴隆农场过去每月发病率在50％左右，现已控制在千分之三以下。
    陵水、保亭两县在国民党反动统治时期，疟疾严重流行，人民无力就医，死亡率很高。解放后，当地党委和政府非常重视抗疟工作。卫生部门在解放初期就组织巡回队，到各个疟疾流行区进行治疗；以后又作了一系列的疟区调查和抗疟研究工作。最近几年，这两个县都设立了疟疾防治站，并发动群众展开除四害运动，一方面对病人进行系统的治疗。每年3月到8月疟疾流行最严重的季节，各个乡村就进行抗复发治疗，还喷射“六六六”等药剂，大力消灭蚊虫。名词解释
