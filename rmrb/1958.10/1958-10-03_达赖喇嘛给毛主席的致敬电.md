Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 1st: The Dalai Lama sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on National Day to express his respect. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the grand celebration of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, I would like to extend my highest respect and warm congratulations to you on behalf of all the people of Tibet.

    Our motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader – yourself, has achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Since last year, after major achievements have been made in the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, profound changes have taken place in social relations and people's ideology. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, all work throughout the country has set off a wave of comprehensive Great Leap Forward, deciding to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years or less. The current international situation is that the East wind prevails over the West wind, which is conducive to our country's socialist construction. Now I once again extend my warm congratulations on the series of victories we have achieved in all aspects.

    In the Tibetan region, we have carried out education against nationalism and to strengthen patriotism, and have launched a resolute struggle against internal and external reactionaries who undermine the unity of the motherland and national unity. In the future, we must further strengthen the anti-imperialist patriotic united front, closely unite around the Communist Party, continue to make progress, and create various conditions for building a new socialist Tibet.

    Our country has the right to take all appropriate measures to liberate our territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other coastal islands, which is our country's internal affair. If U.S. imperialism dares to continue its armed threats and war provocations, when we can no longer tolerate it, in order to defend the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, we Tibetan people will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait!

    I wish you good health!

                            Dalai Lama, October 1, 1958
                                          Tibetan calendar Earth Dog year, August 19th

    达赖喇嘛给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社拉萨1日电　达赖喇嘛在国庆节打电报向毛主席致敬。电报全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    在全国各族人民隆重庆祝中华人民共和国国庆九周年之际，我谨代表西藏全体人民，向您致以崇高的敬礼和热烈的祝贺。
    我们的祖国，在中国共产党和伟大领袖——您的领导下，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利。从去年起，在整风和反右派斗争获得重大成就之后，社会关系和人们的思想意识起了深刻的变化。全国人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，各项工作都掀起了全面大跃进的热潮，决定在十五年或更短一些的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上和超过英国。现在的国际形势是东风压倒西风，是有利于我国的社会主义建设的。现在我再一次为我们在各方面所取得的一系列的胜利，致以热烈的祝贺。
    在西藏地区，我们进行了反对民族主义和加强爱国主义的教育，对于破坏祖国统一和民族团结的内外反动分子展开了坚决的斗争。今后，我们要进一步加强反帝爱国统一战线，紧密地团结在共产党的周围，继续不断的进步，为建设社会主义的新西藏创造各种条件。
    我国有权采取一切适当的方式解放我国的领土台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖及其它沿海岛屿，这是我国的内政。美帝国主义如胆干继续进行武装威胁和战争挑衅，我们在忍无可忍的时候，为了保卫我国领土主权的完整，我们西藏人民将和全国人民一道，坚决把美帝国主义从台湾和台湾海峡赶出去！
    敬祝您身体健康！
                            达赖喇嘛　公元1958年10月1日
                                          藏历土狗年8月19日
