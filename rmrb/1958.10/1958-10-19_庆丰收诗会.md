Celebration of Harvest Poetry Meeting
　　
　　In the red sunlight of Xi Dun, grain piles filled large and small granaries. The people on the threshing ground were full of joy. Moved by the scene, poems flowed from their lips: "Corn is like amber, clear and whole; soybeans are like pearls, round and plump; cotton is a pile of silver, rice is golden and tender; dazzling and endless, the cornucopia's color pales in comparison!" The little sister recited poetry without hesitation; the sister-in-law's poems flowed smoothly: "A osmanthus tree fills the air with fragrance for thousands of miles, the field blossoms are yellow and bright, rice flowers and bean flowers confuse the senses, corn flowers are visited by bees and butterflies, sesame flowers are like phoenixes, and the flying flowers bear fruit with many descendants!" The old man also cleared his throat: "Grain should be compared to the Kunlun Mountains. This year's rice paddies are a vast ocean, a harvesting wave swallows everything. The people have the strength of three heads and six arms, they can destroy and preserve anything in the four seas and five mountains. The mountains and rivers still listen to the production orders, the ghosts and monsters are terrified!" The youth's bold words startled the sky, their spirits were high as if they had drunk from a goblet: "Thunder is the sword, lightning is the shield, the rainbow is the bridge, the wind is the wheel, we use fog, dew, frost, and snow as we please, making the weather favorable and the rain timely. Heavenly horses gallop through the sky riding dragons, and the Jade Emperor bows down!" This autumn's harvest surpasses a thousand autumns, next spring will be ten thousand times better than this spring. The more the poems are sung, the higher the enthusiasm rises, and before we know it, the moon rises over the eastern hill. [Miao Di Illustration]

    庆丰收诗会
    枚屋红红太阳下西墩，粮食堆满大小囤，场上人儿闹盈盈，触景生情诗出唇：玉米如琥珀，剔透囫囵囵；大豆像珍珠，颗颗圆滚滚；棉花一堆银，稻子黄金嫩；眼花撩乱看不尽，聚宝盆儿颜色逊！”小妹吟诗不打顿；大嫂诗句出口顺：“一树桂花万里香，田里花开黄暾暾，稻花豆花乱方寸，玉米花开蜂蝶蹲，芝麻花开如凤仙，飞花结实多子孙！”老汉也把嗓子润：“要把粮食比昆仑。今年稻田汪洋海，一声收割浪潮吞。三头六臂人势众，四海五岳任废存，山河犹听生产令，牛鬼蛇神吓破魂！”青年豪语惊苍穹，精神抖擞如饮樽：“雷作宝剑电作盾，虹为大桥风为轮，雾露霜雪由我用，叫它风调又雨顺。天马行空乘游龙，玉皇大帝拜下风！”今秋丰收胜千秋，明春万倍超今春，诗歌越唱兴越高，不觉月儿上东墩。〔苗　地　插图）
