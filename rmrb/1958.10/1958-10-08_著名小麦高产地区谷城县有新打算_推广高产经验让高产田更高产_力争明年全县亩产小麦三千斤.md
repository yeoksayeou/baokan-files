    Gucheng County, a Famous High-Yield Wheat Area, Has New Plans
    Promote High-Yield Experience to Make High-Yield Fields Even More Productive  Strive for a County-Wide Wheat Yield of 3,000 Jin Per Mu Next Year
    (Our Dispatch) Gucheng County, Hubei Province, which achieved an unprecedented bumper wheat harvest this year, is striving to become a 3,000-jin-per-mu wheat county next year, and will create 40,000 mu of high-yield "satellite" fields with an average yield of over 10,000 jin per mu.
    Gucheng County is one of China's famous high-yield wheat counties. This year, the average yield of nearly 260,000 mu of wheat in the county was 620 jin per mu, more than double that of last year. In order to meet the needs of national construction and the masses, the county has decided to expand the wheat planting area to 360,000 mu and strive for an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu. After achieving this goal, the county's wheat output alone next year will be equivalent to 4.7 times the county's total grain output last year. Averaged over the county's population, each person will have more than 3,300 jin of wheat.
    A large number of facts prove that the county's wheat production still has huge potential: on the one hand, townships, cooperatives, and production teams with wheat yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, and production teams with over 2,000 jin per mu have emerged in various regions of the county, and a large number of high-yield fields with wheat yields of 3,000 jin, 4,000 jin, and even more than 5,000 jin per mu have appeared; but on the other hand, there are still backward cooperatives with wheat yields of only 200 to 300 jin per mu, and backward fields with yields of 100 to 200 jin per mu. Moreover, even the high-yield fields with yields of 4,000 jin or 5,000 jin or more per mu still have many shortcomings in cultivation, such as the land not being plowed deep enough, the fertilizer not being very sufficient, the seeding rate being low, the planting density not being enough, and the management work not being perfect. Therefore, the broad masses unanimously believe that as long as the general fields are raised to the level of high-yield fields, and at the same time the shortcomings in the cultivation of high-yield fields are overcome, it is entirely possible for the county to achieve a yield of 3,000 jin per mu and strive for 40,000 mu with a yield of over 10,000 jin per mu.
    In order to realize the wheat production increase plan, the Gucheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to continue to fully utilize the experience of leading large-scale wheat production increases in the past few years and advanced experience from other places this winter and spring, and to continuously use methods of visits, comparisons, and large-scale airing of views and debates to lead the masses to promote and encourage each other, and to launch a magnificent and large-scale mass production increase movement. In this movement, there will be a competition upsurge of cadres taking the lead and the whole people engaging in high-yield "satellite" experimental fields. Based on the production increase experience of this year's high-yield fields, the technical measures will focus on grasping several key links, namely: deep plowing of land, increasing fertilizer application, timely early sowing, comprehensive dense planting, and strengthening field management. At present, a wheat sowing preparation work centered on deep plowing of land and large-scale fertilizer accumulation has been formed and has achieved great results. Up to now, 300,000 mu of wheat land in the county have been deep plowed, generally to a depth of about 1.2 chi, and high-yield "satellite" fields have been plowed to a depth of about 3 chi. The county has accumulated 300 million dan of farm manure and 110 million dan of soil-based fertilizer. It is estimated that in a few days, all the fertilizers required for sowing will be ready. According to the requirements for increasing production, the county plans to sow 30 to 35 jin per mu for general fields and 50 jin for high-yield "satellite" fields. All the seeds required have been prepared. (Fang Di)

    著名小麦高产地区谷城县有新打算
    推广高产经验让高产田更高产  力争明年全县亩产小麦三千斤
    本报讯　今年小麦获得空前大丰收的湖北省谷城县，正力争明年成为小麦三千斤县，并要创造四万亩平均亩产达万斤以上的高产“卫星”田。
    谷城县是我国著名的小麦高产县之一。今年全县近二十六万亩小麦平均亩产六百二十斤，比去年增产一倍以上。为了适应国家建设和群众的需要，这个县决定将小麦播种面积扩大到三十六万亩，并争取平均亩产量达到三千斤。实现这个目标后，明年全县仅小麦产量就将相当于去年全年粮食产量的四点七倍。按全县人口平均，每人有小麦三千三百多斤。
    大量事实证明：这个县的小麦生产还有着巨大的潜力：一方面，全县各类不同地区都出现了亩产小麦达千斤以上的乡、社和两千斤以上的生产队，并且出现了大批亩产小麦达三千斤、四千斤甚至五千多斤的高产田；但另一方面，也还存在着亩产小麦只二、三百斤的落后社和一、二百斤的落后田。而且就是亩产四千斤、五千斤以上的高产田，在耕作上也还存在着许多缺点，如土地耕得还不够深，肥料也并不很充足，以及播种量少、密植程度不够，管理工作还不完善等。因此，广大群众一致认为，只要把一般田提高到高产田的水平，同时又把高产田耕作上存在的缺点加以克服，全县亩产三千斤并争取有四万亩亩产万斤以上是完全有条件的。
    为了实现小麦增产计划，中共谷城县委决定在今冬明春继续充分运用几年来领导小麦大面积增产的经验和外地先进经验，不断地用参观评比和大鸣大放大辩论的办法，领导群众互相促进、互相鼓舞，掀起一个声势宏伟规模巨大的群众性增产运动。在这个运动中，将要出现一个干部带头、全民大搞高产“卫星”试验田的竞赛高潮。根据今年高产田的增产经验，在技术措施上，将突出地抓住几个环节，即：深翻土地，增施肥料，适时早播，全面密植，加强田间管理。目前，一个以深翻土地和大搞积肥为中心的小麦播种准备工作已经形成，并且获得了很大的成绩。截至目前止，全县麦地进行深翻的已达三十万亩，一般都深翻到一尺二寸左右，高产“卫星”田更深达三尺左右。全县已积农家肥三亿担，造土化肥一亿一千万担，预计再过几天，所需播种肥料即可全部备齐。按照增产要求，这个县规划一般田每亩要下种三十斤到三十五斤，高产“卫星”田下种五十斤，所需种子已全部备好。　（方堤）
