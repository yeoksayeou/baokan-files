    Guaranteeing Safe Sweet Potato Storage
    Tian Nong
    This year, the sweet potato planting area has increased by about 60 million mu compared to last year. Judging from the current growth situation, the yield will increase exponentially. This is a great happy event. However, because sweet potatoes have a large volume, thin skin, and high water content, they are prone to spoilage or rot. How to properly store and utilize such a large quantity of sweet potatoes without loss has become a prominent and important issue in sweet potato production. In addition to expanding utilization by vigorously processing fresh sweet potatoes into dried sweet potatoes, sweet potato slices, sweet potato flour, and starch, it is very important to earnestly do a good job in fresh sweet potato storage.
    Our country's farmers have accumulated and created many good experiences in the storage and preservation of fresh sweet potatoes. Investigations and research from various places have proven that the main cause of sweet potato rot is caused by low temperatures and diseases. Therefore, solving the problems of cold damage and disease during storage is a key issue. However, guaranteeing the safe storage of fresh sweet potatoes is a comprehensive measure that must be approached from all aspects.
    Intact sweet potatoes are the basic condition for safe storage. First, it is necessary to harvest at the right time to avoid the effects of low temperatures or cold damage. Secondly, choose sweet potatoes grown in disease-free fields, and pay attention to gentle digging, handling, and transportation to avoid damage. Storing damaged sweet potatoes is very dangerous. Not only are they prone to rot, but they often spread into a large amount of rot. Sweet potatoes carrying black rot bacteria are the least resistant to storage and must be strictly inspected before being put into the cellar.
    Suitable cellar locations and styles are also closely related to the safe storage of sweet potatoes. If the soil quality of the cellar is poor, the terrain is low-lying, prone to water seepage, collapse, and rising groundwater levels; or if the cellar roof frame is not tight enough, it is prone to wind and rain, and cannot keep warm, it will cause rot and loss of stored sweet potatoes. Therefore, the cellar site should be selected in a high, dry, firm, leeward, and sunny place. The style of the cellar should be determined according to the height of the groundwater level and the amount of storage. In areas with colder weather, large storage volumes, and low groundwater levels, well cellars are generally used; in areas with higher groundwater levels, shed cellars or improved shed cellars can be used; in areas with warmer climates, high groundwater levels, and small storage volumes, above-ground cellars can be used. The dug cellars should be built firmly, airtight, and conducive to safe storage. When using old cellars for storage, cleaning work should be carried out first, such as scraping off a layer of soil from the cellar walls, or brushing a layer of lime slurry, or fumigating with sulfur once, or disinfecting with copper sulfate.
    Controlling the temperature during storage is the central key to ensuring safe storage. If the temperature is below 9 degrees Celsius, cold damage is likely to occur; if the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius, it is easy to germinate and grow, affecting the quality, or it is easy to be infected with diseases. Under normal circumstances, the temperature inside the cellar should be kept between 10 and 16 degrees Celsius as the most suitable. The humidity and air during storage are related to the respiration of sweet potatoes and the temperature inside the cellar and the reproduction of bacteria. Generally, the relative humidity should be kept between 70% and 75%.
    During storage, although the storage methods are different, in order to adapt the changes and needs of the external storage conditions and the sweet potatoes themselves, management must be carried out according to different storage stages.
    First, in the initial stage of storage, that is, half a month to a month after entering the cellar, the temperature is not very low, and the newly harvested sweet potatoes have vigorous respiration, generating a large amount of accumulated heat. At this time, the temperature and humidity in the cellar are high, and soft rot disease is most likely to occur. Therefore, at this stage, it is necessary to especially do a good job in ventilation, cooling, and dehumidification to properly adjust the temperature.
    Second, the middle stage of sweet potato storage is the main storage period. As the temperature decreases and the respiration of sweet potatoes weakens, the temperature inside the cellar gradually decreases. Therefore, maintaining a constant temperature is very important. At this stage, the temperature inside the cellar must not drop below 10 degrees Celsius. In order to maintain the cellar temperature, in addition to closing, covering with soil, and adding grass curtains outside the cellar, covering materials should also be added to the sweet potato pile in the cellar, such as covering the sweet potato pile in the well cellar with grass or adding grass curtains to the cellar door; adding rice husks to the sweet potato pile in the shed cellar and pressing them tightly. The purpose of these measures is to inhibit heat dissipation and avoid cold wind intrusion, ensuring the safe storage of sweet potatoes.
    Third, in the later stage of storage (around the Spring Festival), the temperature is the lowest, and then it gradually begins to warm up. At this time, the sweet potatoes in the general cellar are prone to cold damage or rot due to frequent consumption and reduced quantity, if management is slightly neglected. Therefore, special attention should be paid to opening the cellar door less often and filling the gaps where sweet potatoes have been taken out with straw to maintain a suitable temperature.
    The cellar temperature should be measured with a thermometer. The measurement method is to install temperature measuring tubes in the upper, middle, and lower parts of the sweet potato pile when stacking sweet potatoes, and put a thermometer in the tube; or install a temperature measuring tube on the surface of the sweet potato pile. In severe cold weather, in order not to affect the temperature inside the cellar due to entering and exiting the storage cellar, when using shallow cellars, the temperature measuring tube can be passed straight through the top of the cellar to measure the temperature outside the cellar.

    保证甘薯贮藏安全
    田农
    今年甘薯种植面积比去年增加六千万亩左右，从目前生长情况看，产量将成倍地激增，这是一件大喜事。但是，由于薯块的体积大，表皮薄，水份多，容易变坏或腐烂，如何使这样大量的甘薯妥善贮藏利用，不受损失，就成为薯类生产上一个突出重要的问题。除了扩大利用，大力把鲜薯加工制成薯干、薯片、薯粉和淀粉而外，认真做好鲜薯贮藏工作，十分重要。
    我国农民在鲜薯的贮藏和保管方面已经积累和创造了不少好经验。从各地调查研究证明，甘薯腐烂的主要原因是由于低温和病害所引起的，因此解决贮藏期间的冷害和病害是一个关键性的问题。但保证鲜薯贮藏安全，是一项综合性的措施，必须从各个环节着手。
    薯块完好是安全贮藏的基本条件。首先要做到适时收刨，以免遭受低温或冷害的影响。其次要选择生长在无病薯田里的薯块，并注意轻刨、轻拿、轻运，避免损伤。贮藏受伤的薯块很危险，不仅它本身容易发生腐烂，而且往往会蔓延成大量的腐烂。带有黑斑病菌的薯块，最不耐贮藏，入窖前要进行严格检查。
    适宜的窖址和窖式对于甘薯安全贮藏也有密切的关系。如果挖窖地点的土质不良，地势低洼，容易渗水、坍塌、地下水位上升；或者窖顶棚架做得不够严密，容易透风漏雨，不能保温，都会造成存薯的腐烂损失。因此窖址应当选择地势高燥、土质坚固、背风向阳的地方。窖的式样要根据地下水位的高低、贮藏量的多少来决定。在天气较冷、贮存量大、地下水位低的地方，一般多采用井窖；地下水位较高的地方，可用棚窖或改良棚窖；在气候较暖、地下水位高、贮藏量不大的地方，可以采用地上窖。挖建的窖要修造坚固，不透风，便于安全贮藏。用旧窖贮藏的时候要先进行清洁工作，如将窖壁的土刮去一层，或刷一层石灰浆，或用硫磺熏蒸一次，或用硫酸铜消毒。
    控制贮藏期间的温度是保证安全贮藏的中心关键。如温度低于摄氏九度，则易发生冷害；如果温度高于摄氏二十度以上，则易发芽生长，影响品质，或易感染病害。一般情况下，窖内的温度需经常保持摄氏十到十六度之间最为合适。贮藏期间的湿度与空气，对于薯块的呼吸作用和窖内温度与病菌繁殖都有一定关系，一般相对温度要经常保持70％—75％之间。
    在贮藏期间，尽管贮藏方法不同，但为了使贮藏的外界条件和甘薯本身的变化和需要相适应，必须根据不同的贮藏阶段进行管理。
    第一，在入窖初期，即入窖后的半个月到一个月的期间，气温还不很低，初收获的甘薯呼吸作用旺盛，产生大量的堆积热，这时窖内温度高、湿度大，最易发生软腐病害。因此在这个阶段，需要特别做好通风降温和降湿工作，使温度得到适当调节。
    第二，甘薯的贮藏中期，是贮藏的最主要时期，随着气温的降低和甘薯呼吸作用减弱，窖内的温度逐渐下降，因此保持恒温是十分重要的。在这个阶段，窖内温度不能降到摄氏十度以下。为了保持窖温，除了在窖外进行封闭、复土、加草帘以外，在窖内薯堆上也要加复盖物，如：井窖的薯堆上盖草或在窖的门上加草帘；棚窖薯堆上加草糠秕压紧塞实。这样作的目的都是抑制散热和避免冷风侵袭，保证甘薯安全贮藏。
    第三，在贮藏后期（约在春节前后）气温最低，以后又逐渐开始转暖。这时一般窖内甘薯由于经常取食、数量减少，如对管理稍有疏忽，容易受冷害或招致腐烂，因此要特别注意少开窖门，用草秸填充取薯空隙，以保持适宜温度。
    窖温要用温度计测定，测定的方法是在堆放薯块时，最好在薯堆上、中、下各个部位安装测温筒、筒内放温度计；或者在薯堆表面装一支测温管。严寒时期为不使因进出贮藏窖而影响窖内温度，使用浅窖时，可将测温筒直穿窖顶，在窖外测温。（附图片）
