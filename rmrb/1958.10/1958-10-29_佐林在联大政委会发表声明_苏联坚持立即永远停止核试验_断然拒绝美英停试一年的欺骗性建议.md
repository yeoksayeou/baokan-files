Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 28th: According to TASS, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Zorin, on the instructions of the Soviet government, issued a statement on October 27th at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the issue of stopping atomic and hydrogen weapons tests.

The statement said that the Soviet government has consistently and tirelessly advocated that all types of nuclear weapons tests must be completely and unconditionally stopped. The statement pointed out that in order to achieve a practical solution to this issue, the Soviet Union has taken the step of unilaterally ceasing nuclear weapons tests. If the United States and Britain followed the Soviet example, a universal cessation of nuclear weapons tests would have already become a reality. However, the United States and Britain refused to work with the Soviet Union in this regard and instead conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests.

The statement said that the Soviet government agrees with all the conclusions and recommendations of the Geneva Experts Conference. The Geneva Experts Conference confirmed that it is entirely possible to supervise the universal cessation of nuclear testing, and that establishing such supervision does not present great difficulties.

The statement revealed that after the results of the Geneva Experts Conference stripped away the Western countries' excuses for obstructing the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the U.S. and British governments expressed their willingness to temporarily halt testing for one year. They also spoke of the possibility of extending the temporary suspension, but attached some reservations to this possibility, so as to resume testing when it suited them.

The statement pointed out that the essence of the U.S.-British proposal does not at all mean stopping testing, because it takes about a year to study the results of the series of tests that have been conducted and to prepare for new tests. Agreeing to this proposal would mean embarking on a path of participating in deceiving the people of all countries, because the people of all countries demand that their governments permanently stop atomic and hydrogen weapons tests.

The statement said that the purpose of this approach by the U.S. and British governments is, on the one hand, to obtain a unilateral military advantage over the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, to maintain the possibility of resuming nuclear weapons tests when it is advantageous to them.

The statement pointed out that, therefore, the Soviet government resolutely rejects the U.S. and British governments' proposal to halt testing for one year. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary for all countries possessing nuclear weapons to immediately and permanently cease testing such weapons. The Soviet Union proposes to reach such an agreement with the United States and Britain, even though the Soviet Union has conducted far fewer test explosions than the U.S. and Britain.

However, if the corresponding resolution does not stipulate the permanent cessation of nuclear weapons tests, the Soviet government will reserve the right to increase the number of tests conducted by the Soviet Union after March 31 of this year to the number of tests conducted by the U.S. and Britain combined since that date.

The Soviet Union will continue to strive for a complete solution to the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing.

The Soviet government's starting point is that, although the Soviet government will use all its strength to promote the success of the Geneva conference held on October 31, the cessation of such testing should not depend on whether this conference can reach an agreement.

The Soviet government firmly maintains that the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly calling for a halt to nuclear weapons testing should not have any ambiguity, but should clearly indicate that this resolution remains in effect until the relevant countries sign an agreement to stop atomic and hydrogen weapons tests (regardless of where and when this agreement is signed). Only in this way will the United Nations have fulfilled its duty to the people of all countries who demand an immediate solution to the problem of stopping nuclear testing. The statement expressed that the Soviet government cannot support the adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution that would allow Western countries, who are trying every possible means to obstruct the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, to hide.

The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet government will promote the conclusion of the aforementioned (permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing) agreement, and if the British and American governments also do so, then there is nothing preventing such an agreement from being reached in the near future, and the problem of stopping nuclear weapons testing can be completely and comprehensively resolved.

    佐林在联大政委会发表声明
    苏联坚持立即永远停止核试验
    断然拒绝美英停试一年的欺骗性建议
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：受苏联政府委托，苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长佐林27日在联合国大会政治委员会上就停止原子武器和氢武器试验问题发表了一项声明。
    声明说，苏联政府始终不渝地竭力主张必须完全地、无条件地停止一切类型的核武器试验。声明指出，为了求得这个问题的实际解决，苏联曾经采取了单方面停止核武器试验的步骤，如果美国和英国效法苏联的榜样，那末普遍停止核武器试验就会已经成为现实。但是美国和英国拒绝在这方面同苏联共同努力，反而进行了一系列的核武器试验。
    声明说，苏联政府同意日内瓦专家会议的全部结论和建议。日内瓦专家会议证实了完全有可能对普遍停止核试验进行监督，而且建立这种监督并没有很大的困难。
    声明揭露，在日内瓦专家会议的结果剥去了西方国家阻挠停止核武器试验的借口之后，美英政府表示愿意暂时停止试验一年，他们也谈到延长暂时停止试验的期限的可能性，但是对这种可能性又附加了一些保留条件，以便在对它们合适的时候恢复试验。
    声明指出，美英建议的实质完全不意味着停止试验，因为要研究已进行的一系列试验的结果和准备新的试验，正好需要一年左右的时间。同意这种建议，就意味着走上参与欺骗各国人民的道路，因为各国人民要求他们的政府永远停止原子武器和氢武器试验。
    声明说，美英两国政府的这种作法的目的是，一方面要获得超过苏联的、单方面的军事优势，另一方面又保持在对它们有利的时候恢复核武器试验的可能。
    声明指出，因此苏联政府断然拒绝美国和英国政府关于停止试验一年的建议。苏联政府认为必须这样做：拥有核武器的一切国家立即永远停止这种武器的试验。苏联建议同美国、英国达成这样一个协定，虽然苏联进行过的试验性爆炸比美英进行过的要少得很多。
    但是，如果在相应的决议中不规定永远停止核武器试验的话，苏联政府就将保留这样的权利：把苏联在今年3月31日以后所进行的试验次数增加到美英两国加在一起从这个日期以来所进行的试验次数。
    苏联今后仍将致力于求得停止核武器试验问题的圆满解决。
    苏联政府的出发点是，虽然苏联政府将用一切力量促使10月31日举行的日内瓦会议获得成功，但这种试验的停止不应当取决于这次会议是否能达成协议。
    苏联政府坚决主张，联合国大会呼吁停止核武器试验的决议不应当有任何模棱两可的地方，而应当确切地表明在有关国家签订停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协议以前（不管这种协议在什么地点和什么时间签定）这个决议一直是有效的。只有这样，联合国才算对要求立即解决停止核试验问题的各国人民完成了它自己的职责。声明表示苏联政府不能支持联合国大会通过一个可以让千方百计地阻挠停止核武器试验的西方国家藏身的决议。
    声明最后说，苏联政府将促进达成上述（永久停止核武器试验的）协议，如果英国和美国政府也都这么做的话，那么就没有任何东西阻碍着这种协议能在最近达成，而停止核武器试验的问题就能得到彻底全面的解决。
