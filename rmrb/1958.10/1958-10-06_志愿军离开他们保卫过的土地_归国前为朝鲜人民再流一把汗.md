Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th—The follow-up troops of the third batch of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home started boarding trains today. On the eve of their departure, they also helped the Korean people with production labor, which was sincerely loved and praised by the Korean people.

Now is the harvest season for the Korean people. The officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army returning home regard it as a great happiness and honor to be able to help the Korean people a little more. While working busily handing over defense to the Korean People's Army, officers and soldiers of a certain unit squeezed out time to help the agricultural production cooperative in their garrison area harvest more than 1,000 mu of corn, rice, and millet, and accumulated more than 569,400 jin of fertilizer. When all the officers and soldiers of the farewell delegation to the local Korean people, organized by a certain unit, arrived at an agricultural production cooperative, they happened to find the members harvesting corn in the field. The officers and soldiers immediately went down to the field to work, and only started the cordial farewell activities after harvesting the corn with the members. Many officers and soldiers of organs and companies, when marching from their garrison area to the boarding station, also brought the sickles they had prepared in advance, and used the time for rest along the way to work with the Korean farmers who were harvesting autumn crops in the fields by the roadside. Before leaving their garrison areas, these troops also participated in various labor projects such as building schools, stadiums, clubs, and residences for the local people.

The officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army returning home were unprecedentedly enthusiastic in this labor of friendship. After marching on foot for a whole morning, the officers and soldiers of a certain battalion only rested for half an hour at noon. They also used ten minutes to help the farmers harvest three mu of corn, and transported the harvested corn cobs to the agricultural cooperative. The officers and soldiers of an engineering company of a certain unit worked hard day and night to build a seven-room "propaganda room" for the People's Committee in the garrison area. They did not stop working even on rainy days during the labor process.

The Korean people praised and thanked this brave and hardworking Volunteer Army returning home all the more. Old man Yin Changxue, a family member of the People's Army, specially used eggs, noodles, and sweet potatoes to entertain the Volunteer Army soldiers who helped him build a new house. The soldiers politely declined, so the old man hid the soldiers' shoes and socks to prevent them from leaving, vividly showing the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

    志愿军离开他们保卫过的土地
    归国前为朝鲜人民再流一把汗
    新华社平壤5日电　中国人民志愿军第三批归国部队后续部队今天开始登车归国，他们在出发前夕，还帮助朝鲜人民进行生产劳动，受到朝鲜人民的衷心爱戴和赞扬。
    现在，正是朝鲜人民秋收的季节。志愿军归国部队官兵们把能够再帮助朝鲜人民干一点活，看成是极大的幸福和光荣。某部官兵们在向朝鲜人民军交防的繁忙工作中，挤出时间，帮助驻地农业生产合作社收割玉米、水稻和谷子等一千多亩，积肥五十六万九千四百多斤。某部组成的向驻地朝鲜人民告别的代表团全体官兵，在到达一个农业生产合作社的时候，适逢社员们在田里收玉米，官兵们也就马上下田干起活来，和社员们收完了玉米以后，才开始进行亲切的告别活动。许多机关连队的官兵，在由驻地向登车站进发时，还带上早已准备好的镰刀，利用途中休息的时间，到路旁的田地里和正在收秋的朝鲜农民一起劳动。这些部队在离开驻地以前，还曾经参加了当地人民修建学校、体育场、俱乐部以及住宅等各项劳动。
    志愿军归国部队官兵们在这场友谊的劳动中，热情空前高涨。某营官兵们徒步行军一上午，中午只休息半小时，他们还用十分钟的时间帮助农民收完三亩玉米，并且把收下的玉米棒运送到农业社去。某部工兵连官兵日夜苦战，为驻地里人民委员会修建了一座七间大的“宣传室”，他们在劳动过程中大雨天也不停工。
    朝鲜人民对这支勇敢勤劳的志愿军归国部队，倍加赞扬和感激。人民军军属尹长学老人特地用鸡蛋、挂面和红薯等，宴请帮助他盖起新居的志愿军战士，战士们婉言谢绝，这位老人就把战士们的鞋袜藏起来，不让他们走。生动地表现了中朝人民的深厚友情。
