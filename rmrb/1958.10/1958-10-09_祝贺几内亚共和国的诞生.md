    Congratulations on the Birth of the Republic of Guinea

    A new independent nation has been born on the West African coast. On October 2nd, the Guinean parliament formally declared Guinea's independence and formed a new government. Our people extend warm congratulations on the birth of the Republic of Guinea. On October 7th, our government sent a telegram to Sekou Touré, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guinea, announcing the recognition of the Republic of Guinea and expressing the hope to consult with the Guinean government on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the mutual dispatch of diplomatic representatives.

    The people of Guinea gained independence after voting against De Gaulle's "Constitution". Among Guinea's population of over two and a half million, 95.4% of those who voted cast their votes against De Gaulle's "Constitution." This clearly shows that the vast majority of the Guinean people opposed the status of overseas territories stipulated by De Gaulle's "Constitution." Despite the fact that on the eve of this "referendum," De Gaulle made a special 12,000-mile long trip to French Africa, trying to induce the people of French Africa to support his reactionary "Constitution," and threatening these countries with cutting off "economic aid," the people of Guinea still wanted independence, not the "Constitution." Guinean Prime Minister Sekou Touré once said, "We would rather be poor and free than rich and enslaved." Guinea's independence is clearly a heavy blow to De Gaulle's "Constitution" and its colonial policy. It proves that De Gaulle's reactionary "Constitution" not only cannot save the inevitable decline of the French colonial empire, but also accelerates its collapse.

    Under the long-term rule and plunder of imperialism, the people of Guinea wrote their own history with blood and tears. Western colonialists began selling slaves on the Guinean coast in the 17th century, and large numbers of Guineans were transported to the Americas. Since the French colonialists formally occupied Guinea in 1895, the Guinean people have been subjected to even more appalling plunder and exploitation. The lands of the farmers were arbitrarily distributed to Europeans by the colonialists, and forced labor brutally devastated the lives of local residents. The people of Guinea could not tolerate such oppression and trampling. The broad masses of farmers launched uprisings against the colonialists time and time again. In recent years, workers have also held many strikes to improve their living conditions, giving the colonialists a great blow. The reason why Guinea can achieve independence today is the result of a long-term struggle against imperialism.

    Guinea's independence is another sign of the new high tide of the African national liberation movement. Since the Bandung Conference, the struggle of the African people for national independence has made greater progress. Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana have successively declared independence. At present, among the more than 230 million people in Africa, about 39% of the population has achieved national independence. The remaining 61% of the population is still fighting for national independence. In North Africa, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown from 3,000 to more than 130,000, controlling three-quarters of the land, and recently established the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria. In French West Africa and Equatorial Africa, the people of Mauritania and Chad are conducting guerrilla warfare in jungles and mountains. In Cameroon, despite the fact that French imperialism has adopted cruel suppression methods, imprisoning 50,000 patriotic people in concentration camps, it still cannot suppress the Cameroonian people's desire for national independence, and the armed struggle is unfolding vigorously. In Togo, the Togolese Unification Committee, which actively fights for national independence and the end of the French trusteeship system, won an overwhelming majority in the legislative assembly elections. In the British African colonies of Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, the call for national independence is also growing louder day by day. The so-called "Dark Continent" has dawned, and the "last line of defense" of the colonial system has further collapsed. Guinea's independence is not only a major victory for the Guinean people, but also a major victory for the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries.

    The establishment of the Republic of Guinea has been supported by socialist countries and nationally independent countries. The Soviet Union, North Korea, the United Arab Republic, Ghana, and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria have announced their recognition of Guinea. Imperialist countries are either deliberately silent about this new country or openly hostile. After the results of the "referendum" were announced, the French government immediately decided to stop lending to Guinea, cancel its obligation to carry out various projects in Guinea, and instructed all French technical experts to withdraw to their country within two months. In the eyes of the French colonialists, without the colonialists, Guinea seems unable to survive. But the colonialists have once again miscalculated. People who dare to fight for independence will also dare to fight against any difficulties. The Chinese people have the deepest sympathy for the struggle of the Guinean people for national independence. We believe that with the support of peace-loving countries and people, as long as the Guinean people unite as one, remain vigilant against the conspiracies of imperialism, and continue to move forward under the banner of independence and freedom, they will surely achieve greater victories and achievements.

### 祝贺几内亚共和国的诞生

    祝贺几内亚共和国的诞生
    在非洲西海岸，一个新的独立国家诞生了。10月2日，几内亚议会，正式宣告了几内亚的独立，并组成了新政府。我国人民对于几内亚共和国的诞生，表示热烈祝贺。10月7日，我国政府已致电几内亚共和国总理兼外交部长塞古·杜尔，宣布承认几内亚共和国，并希望就两国建立外交关系和互派外交代表事同几内亚政府进行商谈。
    几内亚人民是在对戴高乐“宪法”投反对票以后获得独立的。在几内亚的二百五十余万人口中，对戴高乐“宪法”投反对票的占投票总数的95.4％，这就清楚地说明，绝大部分的几内亚人民都反对戴高乐“宪法”所规定的海外属地的地位。尽管在这次“公民投票”的前夕，戴高乐特意在法属非洲匆匆地作了一次一万二千英里的长途旅行，竭力诱骗法属非洲人民支持他的反动“宪法”，并以断绝“经济援助”来威胁这些国家，但是，几内亚人民还是要独立，不要“宪法”。几内亚总理塞古·杜尔曾经说过：“我们宁愿穷而自由，也不愿富裕而受人奴役。”几内亚的独立，显然是对戴高乐“宪法”及其殖民政策的一个沉重打击，它证明了戴高乐的反动“宪法”不但不能挽回法兰西殖民帝国必然没落的命运，反而加速了它的崩溃。
    在帝国主义长期的统治和掠夺下，几内亚人民用血和泪写下了自己的历史。西方殖民主义者在十七世纪就开始在几内亚海岸贩卖奴隶，大批大批的几内亚人被运往美洲。自从法国殖民者在1895年正式占领了几内亚以来，几内亚人民就更遭到了骇人听闻的掠夺和剥削。农民的土地被殖民者任意分配给欧洲人，强迫劳动残酷地摧残着当地居民的生命。几内亚人民不能忍受这样的压榨和蹂躏。广大的农民曾经一次又一次地掀起了反抗殖民者的起义。最近几年来，工人们为了改善生活待遇也举行了多次的罢工，给予殖民者以很大的打击。几内亚今天所以能获得独立，是长期以来对帝国主义进行斗争的胜利结果。
    几内亚的独立，是非洲的民族解放运动的新高潮的又一个标志。自从万隆会议以后，非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争有了更大的发展，苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和加纳，一个接着一个宣布了独立。目前在非洲的二亿三千余万人口中，已有约39％的人口取得了民族独立。还有61％的人口正在为民族独立而斗争。在北非，阿尔及利亚的民族解放军已由三千人发展到了十三万多人，控制了四分之三的土地，并且在不久以前成立了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府。在法属西非和赤道非洲，毛里塔尼亚和乍得的人民正在丛林和山区进行游击战。在喀麦隆，尽管法帝国主义采取了残酷的镇压手段，把五万个爱国志士囚禁在集中营里，却仍然压制不住喀麦隆人民争取民族独立的愿望，武装斗争正在如火如荼地展开。在多哥，积极为民族独立和结束法国托管制度而斗争的多哥统一委员会，在立法议会选举中获得了压倒多数的胜利。在英属非洲殖民地怯尼亚、乌干达和尼日利亚，要求民族独立的呼声也一天比一天高涨。所谓“黑暗大陆”已经破晓，殖民主义制度的“最后防线”已经进一步崩溃了。几内亚的独立，不仅是几内亚人民的重大胜利，同时也是殖民地和附属国民族解放运动的一个重大胜利。
    几内亚共和国的成立，得到了社会主义国家和民族独立国家的支持。苏联、朝鲜、阿联、加纳和阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府已经宣布承认几内亚。帝国主义国家对这个新生的国家，或者故意默不作声，或者公开表示敌视。法国政府在“公民投票”结果公布后马上决定停止贷款给几内亚，取消在几内亚境内进行各种工程的义务，并且指示法国的技术专家在两个月内全部撤退回国。在法国殖民者看来，没有殖民主义者，几内亚就似乎无法生存下去。但是殖民主义者又一次打错了算盘。敢于争取独立的人民也就会敢于同任何困难进行斗争。中国人民对几内亚人民为争取民族独立而进行的斗争抱着最深切的同情。我们相信，在爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，只要几内亚人民团结一致，时刻警惕帝国主义的阴谋，高举独立自由的旗帜继续前进，那么他们就一定会获得更大的胜利和成就。
