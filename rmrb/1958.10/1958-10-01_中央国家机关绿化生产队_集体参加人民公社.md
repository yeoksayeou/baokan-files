    Central State Organ Greening Production Team
    Collectively Joins People's Commune
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The greening production teams of all units of the central state organs today formed two collective member households and joined the Qianjin People's Commune and the Ming Tombs People's Commune in the suburbs of the capital, respectively. These two communes will become experimental fields for the central state organs to transition to communism and a melting pot for training cadres. With the abundant and free labor and material support from various organs, the construction here will be completed as soon as possible into a wealthy and beautiful communist idyllic landscape, and the broad masses of cadres will obtain long-term physical labor and communist ideological training opportunities from here. Making this decision is an important gift from the central state organs to the ninth anniversary of the National Day.
    All sixty-eight department-level and State Council directly subordinate bureau-level units of the central state organs, and all on-the-job cadres of all levels who should participate in physical labor according to the central regulations, will take turns to serve as members in these two people's communes in the future, and carry out the construction work of communist grass-roots units together with the local old commune members. More than 3,000 cadres of all levels, who were the first batch of commune members, formed thirty-seven production teams and held a joining-the-commune celebration meeting with the old commune members on September 30.
    The first batch of more than 3,000 cadres of all levels originally participated in labor training in the suburbs of the capital in rotation, carrying out mountain greening and agricultural production work. Yesterday at six o'clock, as soon as dawn broke, they held high red flags, beat gongs and drums, and happily marched in formation to the location of the people's commune's commune committee. The local masses of peasants welcomed them along the road, expressing their most cordial and profound feelings towards them. At the venue of the grand celebration meeting for new and old commune members, the resolution letters and guarantees put forward by the new commune members of various units were posted everywhere, and many new commune members also wrote enthusiastic poems, expressing their praise for the people's commune and their lofty ambitions to build communism.
    According to the regulations of the Leading Group for Central State Organ Cadres Participating in Physical Labor, in the future, the number of people from the central state organs going to these two people's communes to work every day shall generally be no less than 2,000, and they shall be completely managed and mobilized uniformly by the people's commune committee. When some cadres have completed their labor training period and need to be transferred back to their own organs, they must first transfer the next batch of cadres participating in labor training to take over and make up for the shortfall. Some cadres who go to work for a short period of one day to several days will be regarded as temporary voluntary labor support for the people's commune. Before the new commune members of the central state organs have obtained income from labor, the means of production they need are invested by various organs, and their living needs are also provided by their own organs. The labor of the cadres is completely regarded as free support for the two people's communes. In order to strengthen the education and management of the new commune members of the central state organs, the various organs have also transferred a group of cadres to work and work in the two people's communes for one year, two years or even long-term assignment, some of whom are responsible cadres and participate in the leadership of the people's commune committee.

    中央国家机关绿化生产队
    集体参加人民公社
    本报讯　中央国家机关所有单位的绿化生产队今天组成二个集体社员户，分别参加首都郊区农村的前进人民公社和十三陵人民公社。这两个公社将成为中央国家机关向共产主义过渡的试验田和锻炼干部的熔炉。这里的建设工作在各机关充裕的、无偿的劳力和物力的支援下，将尽快地建成富裕美好的共产主义田园，而广大干部将从这里获得长期的体力劳动和共产主义思想锻炼的机会。作出这个决定是中央国家机关向国庆九周年的一项重要的献礼活动。
    中央国家机关所有部一级和国务院直属局一级单位共有六十八个，所有按照中央规定应该参加体力劳动的各级在职干部，今后都要轮流去这两个人民公社充当社员，同当地老社员一起进行共产主义基层单位的建设工作。作为第一批社员的三千多名各级干部，组成了三十七个生产队，已经在9月30日同老社员一起举行了入社联欢大会。
    第一批入社的三千多名各级干部都是原来就在首都郊区轮流参加劳动锻炼，进行山地绿化和农业生产工作的。昨天六时，天刚拂晓，他们就高举红旗，敲起锣鼓，兴高采烈地列队开往人民公社社委会的所在地。当地农民群众夹道欢迎，对他们表示了最亲切最深厚的感情。在盛大的新老社员联欢会的会场上，贴满了各个单位新社员提出的决心书和保证书，许多新社员还写下了热情的诗句，表达了对人民公社的歌颂和他们建设共产主义的雄心壮志。
    根据中央国家机关干部参加体力劳动领导小组的规定，今后中央国家机关每天到这两个人民公社劳动的人数，一般不少于二千人，他们完全由人民公社社委会统一的管理和调动。有些干部劳动锻炼期满需要调回本机关工作时，必须事先抽调下一批参加劳动锻炼的干部前往接替，补足缺额。一部分干部前往短期劳动一天到几天的，就作为对人民公社临时的义务劳动支援。中央国家机关的新社员在劳动还没有获得收益以前，所需要的生产资料均由各机关投资，生活需要也由本机关供给，干部的劳动完全作为对两个人民公社的无偿支援。为了加强对中央国家机关新社员的教育和管理，各机关还抽调了一批到两个人民公社劳动和工作一年、二年以至长期下放的干部，其中一部分负责干部并参加人民公社社委会的领导。
