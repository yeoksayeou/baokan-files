Grow and Manage Rapeseed Well
*People's Daily* Commentator

Many regions in the South are now intensely engaged in rapeseed sowing, and a few have already completed the task. How is this year's rapeseed sowing going? Is there a guarantee of completing the original planned sowing area? Is the seedling emergence good in the already sown rapeseed fields? How is the early management after seedling emergence? Are the fertilization and irrigation efforts keeping up with the demands of the great leap forward in rapeseed production? These are all issues that deserve attention, and the local leading bodies need to conduct an immediate inspection of the situation in this regard to ensure that the first step in increasing rapeseed production is done well.

This year, unprecedented bumper harvests have been achieved in grain, cotton, and oil crops. However, compared with the multiple increases in grain and cotton, the increase in oil crop production appears somewhat lagging. Taking rapeseed, one of the main oil crops, as an example, the total national rapeseed production this year increased by 56.5% compared to last year, and the average yield per mu also increased by 41.5%. The increase is not small, but it is not as large compared to the increase in crops such as rice and wheat. In the striving goal of ensuring adequate food and clothing for the people nationwide, as proposed by Chairman Mao, it is required that each person has an average of 20 jin of vegetable oil per year, and we are still far from this goal. This shows that we must make more arduous efforts in oil crop production. In the next year, we must make oil crops advance alongside grain and cotton, and make a common leap forward. In order to strive for a high-speed increase in oil crop production next year, we should first start by doing a good job in the current rapeseed planting work.

Some comrades do not have high confidence and are not enthusiastic about accelerating the development of rapeseed production. These comrades have not fully liberated their minds. They admit that rapeseed can increase production, but they do not quite believe that rapeseed can increase production faster. It is true that rapeseed yields were indeed not very stable in the past, and even farmers felt that planting rapeseed was not as cost-effective as planting other crops. However, the instability of rapeseed yields was caused by the backward farming methods of the past. After the improvement of farming methods, it has been proven that rapeseed yields can not only be stabilized, but also greatly increased. In fact, whether or not we can increase production significantly depends on whether we have grasped the various yield-increasing measures and made the necessary efforts. This year, the national average rapeseed yield per mu is 73 jin, but six provinces and cities across the country have an average rapeseed yield per mu of more than 100 jin, and some counties have a rapeseed yield per mu of more than 200 jin. In some places, there have even been high-yielding fields with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Doesn't this show that the potential for increasing rapeseed production is still very large? Another situation is that in the past year, people have put more effort into grain and cotton production and less effort into oil crop production. For example, people have used great efforts to cultivate high-yielding grain fields, but few are willing to use greater efforts to cultivate high-yielding rapeseed fields. In the future, when people are actively striving for an all-round bumper harvest of various crops, who dares to say that many high-yield "satellites" with records much higher than the current ones will not be released in rapeseed production? Who dares to say that rapeseed cannot quickly leap forward into the ranks of high-yield crops? In the rapeseed production communique for 1958 recently announced by the Ministry of Agriculture, it is required that the average yield per mu in each province be raised to more than 200 to 300 jin next year. This should be achievable. All rapeseed-producing provinces should strive to achieve and exceed this goal. Only with a positive and resolute attitude towards rapeseed production can we do the current production work effectively.

The rapeseed sowing period will soon pass, but the progress of sowing work in some areas is slow. These areas should seize the season to accelerate the rapeseed sowing work and ensure the completion of the planting area plan.

Areas that have completed the rapeseed sowing work should pay close attention to the emergence of seedlings. According to recent surveys in some areas, the sowing work in some rapeseed fields is rough, the fertilizer is insufficient, and the seedlings are turning yellow, which urgently needs to be remedied. The Wenjiang County in Sichuan Province, after inspection, found that 18% of the area in the sown fields had seedling mortality, so it immediately mobilized the masses to replant and carry out weeding and topdressing. Songzi County in Hubei Province found that the seedling emergence in some rapeseed fields was uneven, and some fields had yellow and thin seedlings due to insufficient fertilizer, so it organized manpower to check each plot, replant and apply fertilizer, and at the same time strengthen field management to achieve no weeds, no barren seedlings, no thin seedlings, no missing seedlings, and no insects in the fields. These measures are very necessary. This year, a large area in various places has adopted seedling raising and transplanting. The places that implement this measure for the first time must conduct training in seedling raising and transplanting techniques to ensure that the seedlings are well raised and transplanted. Some places need to transplant the raised rapeseed seedlings into the late rice fields after harvest. These places should do everything possible to promote the early maturity of late rice in order to harvest the late rice early and plant rapeseed in time, so as not to delay the season and cause losses.

Some areas do not pay attention to rapeseed production, and rarely manage it after planting, and are accustomed to turning poorly growing rapeseed into green manure. Therefore, there have been large areas of abandoned rapeseed fields over the years. In 1958, there was still a part of the abandoned area, although this abandoned area was much smaller than in previous years. Abandoned rapeseed fields are an obstacle to increasing rapeseed production, and this situation should be fundamentally changed in 1959. At the time of sowing, we should eliminate the idea of "harvest if there is, discard if there is not," and establish the idea of striving for a great rapeseed harvest in every possible way.

In order to strive for a greater rapeseed harvest, it is necessary to carry out careful cultivation and management from sowing to harvest, and ensure that one mu is harvested for every mu planted. Not only that, but we must also strive to harvest more. Therefore, in practical work, we need to combine the cultivation of small-area "satellite fields" with the cultivation of large-area high-yielding fields, and resolutely eliminate backward fields with a yield of less than 200 jin per mu. If we can do this, rapeseed production next year will surely achieve a greater leap forward.

    把油菜种好管好
    本报评论员
    现在南方许多地区正在紧张地进行油菜播种工作，少数地区已经完成了这项工作。今年的油菜播种工作做得怎么样？完成原定播种面积计划有没有保证？已经播种的油菜出苗情况好不好？出苗后的早期管理做得怎样？施肥、灌溉工作是否跟上了油菜生产大跃进的要求了？这些问题都值得注意，各地领导机关有必要对这方面的情况立即进行一次检查，保证把油菜增产的第一步工作做好。
    今年粮食、棉花和油料作物都获得了空前的大丰收。但是，同粮食和棉花的成倍地增产的情况来比较，油料作物的增产显得有些落后。就以主要油料作物之一的油菜来说，今年全国油菜籽总产量比去年增加了56.5％，每亩平均产量也增加了41.5％。增产的幅度是不小的，可是同水稻、小麦等作物的增产幅度来比，就不大了。毛主席提出的全国人民丰衣足食的奋斗目标中，要求全国每人每年平均有二十斤植物油，现在距离这项目标还很远。这说明在油料作物生产上我们必须作更艰巨的努力。在下一个年度，我们一定要使油料作物跟粮食、棉花并驾齐驱，共同跃进。而为了争取明年油料作物高速度地增产，首先应当从搞好当前的油菜种植工作开始。
    有些同志对于加速发展油菜生产的信心不高，劲头不大。这些同志的头脑还没有完全解放。他们承认油菜是可以增产的，但却不大相信油菜可能更快地增产。不错，过去油菜产量的确不大稳定，连农民也觉得种油菜不如种别的庄稼合算。但是，油菜产量不稳定，是过去的落后的耕作方法所造成。在耕作方法改进之后，证明油菜产量不但可以稳定，而且可以大大提高。事实上，能不能大量增产，就看我们是不是抓住了各项增产措施，作了应有的努力。今年全国油菜籽每亩平均产量是七十三斤，但是，全国就有六个省市的油菜籽平均亩产量达到一百斤以上，有些县的油菜籽亩产量在二百斤以上。有些地方还出现了亩产千斤以上的丰产田。这难道不是说明了油菜的增产潜力还很大吗？还有一个情况，就是过去的一年中，人们在粮棉生产上下的工夫多，在油料作物生产上下的工夫少。比如人们用很大的力量去培养粮食高额丰产田，却很少肯用较大的力量去培养油菜高额丰产田。在今后人们积极争取各种作物全面大丰收的情况下，谁敢说油菜生产上不会放出许多比现在的纪录高得多的高产“卫星”，谁敢说油菜不能很快跃进到高产作物的行列呢？农业部不久前公布的1958年油菜生产公报中，要求明年把各省平均亩产量分别提到二百斤到三百斤以上。这应该是可以达到的。油菜产区的各省都应当努力达到和超过这个目标。只有对油菜生产抱积极、坚决的态度，才能把当前的生产工作切实做好。
    油菜播种期很快就要过去，但有部分地区播种工作进度迟缓。这些地区应该抓紧季节加速油菜播种工作，保证种植面积计划的完成。
    完成油菜播种工作的地区，应当密切注意出苗情况。据最近某些地区调查，有些油菜田的播种工作粗糙，肥料不足，幼苗发黄，急需加以补救。四川省温江县检查结果，发现已经播种的田里有18％的面积上有幼苗死亡现象，于是立即发动群众补种，并进行耘苗追肥。湖北省松滋县发现部分油菜田出苗不齐，有些田因为肥料不足，幼苗黄瘦，就组织人力逐块检查，补种补肥，同时加强田间管理，作到田间无草、无荒苗、无瘦苗、无缺苗、无虫。这些措施都是很必要的。今年各地采用育苗移栽的面积很大，初次实行这项措施的地方，必须进行育苗移栽技术的训练，以便保证把苗育好栽好。有些地方需要把育好的油菜苗移栽在收获后的晚稻田里。这些地方应当千方百计地促使晚稻早熟，以便早收晚稻，及时栽植油菜，以免贻误季节，造成损失。
    有些地区农民对油菜生产不重视，种植以后很少去管理，习惯于把生长不好的油菜翻作绿肥。因此历年都有面积很大的废弃油菜田。1958年仍然有一部分废弃的面积，虽然这种废弃面积比往年减少了许多。废弃油菜田是油菜增产的一个障碍，1959年应当根本改变这种情况。在播种的时候，就应当打消那种“有就收，没有就丢”的思想，树立千方百计争取油菜大丰收的思想。
    要想争取油菜的更大丰收，必须从播种到收获，精细地进行培育管理，保证种一亩收一亩。不但如此，而且要争取多收。因此，在实际工作中，需要把培育小面积的“卫星田”同培育大面积的丰产田结合起来，坚决消灭每亩产二百斤以下的落后田。能做到这样，明年的油菜生产一定会实现更大的跃进。
