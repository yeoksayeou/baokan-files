　　"阿妈尼 (Āmāní)," how naturally and smoothly I utter this address. In those years of war and construction we spent together, I don't know how many hundreds or thousands of times I've called it. When going out in the morning, I would say goodbye to 阿妈尼; when returning in the evening, I would greet 阿妈尼; I carefully told 阿妈尼 any good news; after an attack, I would rush to deliver the good news to 阿妈尼. In our daily lives, it has become the most natural, most common, and most indispensable language, like a child calling for their mother, something said dozens of times a day!

　　But today, it seems so sacred and precious. Today, when I must bid farewell to 阿妈尼, these three words carry such weight: a thousand words can only be used to express it, and full of passion can only be used to express it. When I call 阿妈尼, all the unforgettable things, one by one, emerge from my memory.

　　Marching at night in the severe cold of forty-three degrees below zero, my legs were frostbitten, you warmed me with your clothing, and you warmed my feet with your hands. Once, I was wounded in battle, and amidst the smoke of gunfire, you carried me back to the cave, and tore off the quilt to wrap my wound. You knew I loved to eat Korean pickled vegetables, and every time you made them, you would send me a few bowls. You understood my temper, and you could distinguish even the tone of my voice so clearly. Hearing footsteps from afar, you knew I was back. Whether I was happy or anxious, you could tell by looking at my eyes. Once, the bugle had sounded, but I hadn't gotten out of bed yet, so you sat by the bed, touched my forehead, and asked me if I was sick, if I had caught a cold? ... 阿妈尼, how can all this be expressed, how can all this not be kept firmly in my heart.

　　Even these things around you bring me endless memories: this roof we built together; this earthen kang we whitewashed together; I carried water with the water jar time and time again; I swept the courtyard clean over and over again; how many times did you use the needle stuck on the wall to sew my clothes; how many times did you use the pot on the stove to boil water and cook for me; the willow tree in the front yard was planted by me and my brother together; the plow by the wall was repaired by me and 阿爸基 together; even this iron basin, it also played cheerful music, accompanying us to dance
  “嗡哩呀 (Wēng lī ya)” “道拉机 (Dàolājī),” from dusk until dawn.

　　These eight springs and autumns of joint combat and joint construction, like an invisible blood vessel, connect my heart to your heart, merging our blood together. Eight years! When I came, I was still a seventeen-year-old child, now I am a veteran soldier; eight years ago I only had a Chinese mother, now I have a Korean mother too...

　　The sound of the departure bugle interrupted my memories, the sound of the departure bugle urged me to embark immediately.

　　Don't scatter flowers, don't shout slogans, don't give gifts, don't shed tears, let's walk hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder for one more journey, look at everything in this homeland, and sing a farewell song.

　　This is the eighth year. The azaleas are blooming more brightly, red all over the hills. The newly planted poplars by the roadside have sprouted new buds. The river flows quietly in the canal, and the seedlings grow taller in the rice paddies. In the apple orchard, silver flowers are blooming everywhere, like stars in the sky. In the "Friendship Fish Pond," schools of fish are playing, like rolling pearls, their scales gleaming. On the plain, large tracts of land have been plowed by tractors, and oily black paths stretch straight into the distance. Ah! This is another year of harvest, and the loved ones living on this land will forever be prosperous and strong.

　　Waves of flowers, tides of people roll forward. Some are still blessing, some are still saying goodbye, some are still giving souvenirs. I look back at 阿妈尼, she is standing on the small slope by the apple orchard, a round red sun rises from her feet, and ten thousand golden rays shoot from behind her to the boundless earth. She stands tall, her gray hair shining with the light of life, her wrinkled hands still waving incessantly, waving...

　　Ah! Farewell, 阿妈尼. Farewell, Mother.

　　Whenever I feel the warmth of the sun, I will think of you.

### 再见吧，阿妈尼！

    再见吧，阿妈尼！
    邱静宽
    “阿妈尼”，这称呼我喊得多自然、多流畅。在那一同度过的战争与建设的年月里，我不知道喊过几百次，几千次。清晨外出，我要向阿妈尼告别；傍晚归来，我要向阿妈尼问好；有好消息我仔细讲给阿妈尼听；出击回营我抢着给阿妈尼传送捷报。在我们日常生活中，它已成了最自然、最平常、最不可少的语言，像孩子叫妈妈，那天不得说上几十遍！
    然而今天它却显得这样神圣、珍贵。今天，当我要向阿妈尼告别的时候，这三个字却有着这样重的分量：千言万语只能用它来诉说，满腔激情只能用它来表达。当我呼唤阿妈尼的时候，那难忘的一切，一桩桩一件件又从我的记忆里涌现出来。
    冒着零下四十三度严寒夜行军，我冻坏了腿，你用衣襟为我保暖，你用双手为我温脚。一次战斗中我负了伤，在炮火的硝烟中你把我背回山洞，拆下被絮为我包伤。你知道我爱吃朝鲜咸菜，每次做好总要送来几碗。你摸透了我的脾气，就连说话的语音，也分辨得那样清楚。老远听见脚步声，你就知道是我回来了。我高兴还是心焦，你一看我的眼睛就知道。有一次，吹过号我还没有起床，你就坐到床边，摸着我的额头问我可是生了病，可是着了凉？……阿妈尼，这一切如何能诉说得尽，这一切怎么能不牢记在心。
    就是你周围的这些东西，也会给我带来无限的回忆：这屋顶是我们一起盖的；这土炕是我们一起粉的；水罐我一次又一次地顶过水；院子我一遍又一遍地扫净；壁上插的针你多少次用它给我缝补衣服；灶台上的锅你多少次用它给我烧水做饭；前庭的柳树是我和弟弟一起栽；墙边的步犁是我和阿爸基一道修好；就是这个铁脸盆，也曾奏着欢快的乐曲，陪伴我们跳
  “嗡哩呀”“道拉机”，从黄昏直到天明。
    这共同战斗共同建设的八个春天和秋天，像一道无形的血管，从我的心通向你的心，把我们的血液溶汇在一起。八年哪！来时我还是一个十七岁的孩子，现在已是一个老练的战士；八年前我只有中国妈妈，如今我又有了朝鲜母亲……。
    出发的号声打断了我的回忆，出发的号声催我马上登程。
    鲜花别撒了，口号别呼了，礼物别送了，眼泪别流了，还是让我们手挽手肩并肩地再走一程，看看这故乡的一切，唱一阕送别的歌曲。
    这是第八个年头了。金达莱开得更鲜艳，红遍山岗。路旁刚栽下的白杨已抽出新芽。水渠里江水静静流，秧田里苗儿节节长。苹果林头，银色的花朵开遍，像满天星斗。“友谊鱼池”中，鱼儿成群游戏，像滚动的明珠，鳞光闪闪。平川上大片土地已被拖拉机翻起，乌油油的一道道直伸向远方。啊！这又是一个丰收的年景，生活在这片土地上的亲人们，将永远富强昌盛。
    花的波浪，人的潮水向前滚滚。有的还在祝福，有的还在话别，有的还在赠送纪念品。我回头看看阿妈尼，她站在苹果园边的小坡上，一轮通红的太阳从她脚下升起，万道金光从她身后射向无边的大地。她屹立着，苍苍白发闪耀着生命的光辉，刻满皱纹的手还在不住挥动，挥动……。
    呵！再见吧，阿妈尼。再见吧，母亲。
    每当我感到太阳的温暖，就会想起你。
