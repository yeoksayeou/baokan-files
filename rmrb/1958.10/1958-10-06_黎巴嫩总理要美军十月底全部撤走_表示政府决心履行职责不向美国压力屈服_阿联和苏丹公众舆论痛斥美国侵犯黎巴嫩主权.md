Xinhua News Agency report: According to a report in the "Red Right Newspaper" on the 5th, Lebanese Prime Minister Karami emphasized in an interview with the newspaper's Beirut correspondent that all foreign troops must withdraw from Lebanon no later than the end of October this year.

Regarding the US ambassador's attempt to reorganize the Lebanese government to accommodate members of the Chamoun group, Karami reiterated that there is no question of the government resigning or being reorganized. He said, "We do not intend to succumb to pressure or threats."

Karami said that the main task of the new cabinet is to establish a calm and free atmosphere in Lebanon and to enable all citizens to act with absolute freedom.

According to the Polish Press Agency: Lebanese Prime Minister Karami told a Polish Press Agency reporter that the entire Lebanese government, its entire membership, is determined to fulfill its responsibilities to the end, and therefore there is no question of the cabinet resigning or being reorganized.

Prime Minister Karami said that the government will soon submit its domestic and foreign policies to parliament. He also said that the date for the parliamentary meeting has not yet been determined. He said that it is premature for people to make remarks about what steps will be taken in the event that the government fails to win a vote of confidence.

Karami emphasized that the situation in Lebanon is improving day by day, and it can be expected that the situation will be completely under control in a very short period of time. He said that, with this goal in mind, the government army must ensure an atmosphere of domestic peace and security.

Xinhua News Agency report: The United States' blatant interference in Lebanon's internal affairs and its instigation of riots by members of the Chamoun group have aroused anger in Arab public opinion.

Cairo's "People's Daily" asked: Why is the United States interfering in the affairs of the Lebanese government? Who authorized the US ambassador to carry out a "mediation" mission that is actually bankrupt? Is Lebanon a state of the United States, and should its problems be solved by the responsible US authorities while playing golf or drinking whiskey?

Damascus's "Alif Baa" newspaper said that the United States is taking advantage of the economic collapse in Lebanon caused by the Chamoun regime to step up its instigation of Phalangist elements to create riots. The United States hopes to use this pressure to force the new government to agree to some of its agents participating in the government, thereby ultimately turning Lebanon into its base and prolonging the stay of its troops in Lebanon.

Sudan's National Party Chairman Sadiq al-Mahdi said that the US ambassador's suggestions to Lebanon are "open interference aimed at controlling the Lebanese people's own affairs," which "infringes on Lebanon's independence and sovereignty."

Sudan's National Union Party Vice Chairman Mubarak Zarrouk said that his party and all nationalists strongly condemn this US intervention, which is in "complete violation" of the United Nations Charter. Zarrouk said, "The United States' actions will strengthen the anti-American sentiment held by peace-loving people."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Beirut News: Under the pressure of the forces of peace and justice throughout the world, the United States had no choice but to withdraw about one thousand of its invading troops from Lebanon yesterday. It is reported that this group of invading troops boarded a US warship bound for West Germany.

Although, according to the agreement between the United States and the Lebanese government, the United States must withdraw all its invading troops from Lebanon by the end of October, there are already indications that the United States is plotting to delay the withdrawal date if the reactionary Chamoun group cannot obtain several seats in the Lebanese government before this deadline, as the United States intends. A United Press International reporter revealed this conspiracy in a message from Washington on the 4th. Quoting US officials, the US reporter wrote that if the political unrest in Lebanon "develops to a dangerous level," the withdrawal of US troops in Lebanon "may be delayed."

    黎巴嫩总理要美军十月底全部撤走
    表示政府决心履行职责不向美国压力屈服
    阿联和苏丹公众舆论痛斥美国侵犯黎巴嫩主权
    据新华社讯　据“红色权利报”5日报道，黎巴嫩总理卡拉米在接见该报驻贝鲁特记者时强调说，全部外国军队最迟必须在今年10月底以前撤出黎巴嫩。
    谈到美国大使企图使黎巴嫩政府改组以容纳夏蒙集团分子的问题，卡拉米重申，根本不存在政府辞职或者改组的问题。他说，我们不打算向压力或者威胁屈服。
    卡拉米说，目前新内阁的主要任务是要在黎巴嫩建立起一种平静和自由的气氛，并使全体公民能够绝对自由地行动。
    据波兰通讯社道报：黎巴嫩总理卡拉米对波兰通讯社记者说，整个黎巴嫩政府、它的全体成员决心把他们的职责履行到底，因此不存在内阁辞职或是重组的问题。
    卡拉米总理说，政府将在最近向议会提出它的国内外政策。他又说，议会开会的日期还没有确定。他说，人们发表万一政府不能获得信任票时将采取什么步骤的言论，是为时过早的。
    卡拉米着重说，黎巴嫩的局势日益好转，可以期望在一个非常短的时期内将完全可以控制局势。他说，本着这个目标，政府军必须确保国内和平和安全的气氛。
    据新华社讯　美国明目张胆地干涉黎巴嫩内政和指使夏蒙集团分子制造骚乱的行为，引起了阿拉伯国家舆论的愤怒。
    开罗“人民报”问道：美国为什么干涉黎巴嫩政府的事务？是谁授权美国大使进行实际上是破产的干涉的“调停”任务的？难道黎巴嫩是美国的一个州，它的问题应当由美国负责当局一边打着高尔夫球或者喝着威士忌酒一边来解决吗？
    大马士革“阿利夫巴报”说，美国正在利用夏蒙政权所造成的黎巴嫩经济崩溃的情况，加紧唆使长枪党分子制造骚乱。美国指望用这种压力迫使新政府同意它的一些代理人参加政府，从而最后把黎巴嫩变成它的基地，并且拖长它的军队留在黎巴嫩的时间。
    苏丹国民党主席萨迪克·马赫迪说，美国大使向黎巴嫩提出的建议是“公开干涉，目的在于控制黎巴嫩人民自己的事情”，这“侵犯了黎巴嫩的独立和主权”。
    苏丹民族联合党副主席穆巴拉克·扎鲁克说，他的党和所有民族主义者都强烈谴责美国这种“完全违反”联合国宪章的干涉行动。扎鲁克说，“美国这样做，将加强爱好和平的人民所怀有的反美情绪。”
  据新华社5日讯　贝鲁特消息：全世界和平与正义力量的压力下，美国在昨天不得不从黎巴嫩再撤出它的约一千名侵略军队。据报道，这批侵略军装上一艘美国军舰前往西德。
    尽管根据美国和黎巴嫩政府的协议美国必须在10月底以前把它的侵略军队全部撤出黎巴嫩，但是已经有迹象显示，美国正在阴谋拖延撤军日期，如果反动的夏蒙集团还不能像美国预谋那样在这个期限以前在黎巴嫩政府中取得几个席位。合众国际社记者4日从华盛顿发出的一条消息中，就透露了美国的这一阴谋。这位美国记者援引美国官方人士的话写道，假如黎巴嫩的政治骚乱“发展到危险程度”的话，美国在黎巴嫩的军队的撤退“也许还会延期。”
