Seize the Agricultural Season, Accelerate Autumn Plowing!
Autumn Plowing Campaign Enters Climax in Inner Mongolia and Jilin

(Reported by our newspaper) Farmers of all ethnic groups in the agricultural and semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are rushing to deeply plow their land. As of October 20th, from the foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains in the north to the rural areas of Ordos in the south, a million-strong army of farmers had already cultivated more than 28,690,000 mu of farmland, accounting for 54.8% of this year's autumn plowing plan.

This year's autumn plowing campaign in Inner Mongolia is being carried out under the conditions of vigorously developing steel production and unprecedented agricultural bumper harvests. About one-third of the region's more than 3.2 million laborers are投入(tóurù) to steel production; while this year's grain output has increased by more than 1.3 times compared to last year, and the autumn harvest workload is also unprecedentedly heavy. Based on this situation, Party and government departments at all levels have made unified arrangements for the labor force involved in steel, autumn harvest, and autumn plowing, so that they can advance simultaneously. The Inner Mongolia Party Committee also organized more than 6,000-member steel, autumn harvest, and autumn plowing work teams and labor brigades to work in the rural areas of various banners and counties. Now, most banners, counties, townships, and people's communes have established autumn plowing offices or headquarters, mobilizing all possible labor to participate in the autumn plowing campaign. Many people's communes have also implemented the "Six To The Field" (command goes to the field, eating goes to the field, living goes to the field, meetings and debates go to the field, learning goes to the field, entertainment goes to the field) and the method of changing people and changing cattle without stopping the plow, plowing the land day and night.

Breaking down conservative ideas such as "conditions-ism," "skepticism," and "gradualism" is an important reason for the vigorous development of the autumn plowing and deep plowing campaign in Inner Mongolia. In addition to launching mass debates among commune members, Tuquan County also investigated and summarized the benefits of autumn plowing and deep plowing in recent years. The survey results proved that autumn plowed land can increase production by 15% to 100%, and the plowed land not only increases production in the first year, but also in the second and third years. Using these examples, the county held on-site meetings and organized autumn plowing training classes, immediately launching an autumn plowing assault month throughout the county. Now, there are often 20,000 people engaged in autumn plowing night battles.

In the deep plowing campaign, people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region also provided strong support. The pastoral areas of Bayannur League supported the agricultural areas with nearly 10,000 head of cattle, horses, and other draft animals, and many camels participated in deep plowing. The Jirem League used 40,000 head of scattered livestock in the semi-agricultural/semi-pastoral areas to plow the land. Now, there are about 100,000 head of scattered livestock participating in deep plowing throughout the region. Some people's communes have also demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation, supporting brother communes with surplus draft animals for autumn plowing.

This year, Inner Mongolia will autumn plow 52,300,000 mu of farmland, accounting for 87.1% of next year's planting area. This is a great change in Inner Mongolia's cultivation system and an important guarantee for a greater bumper harvest next year.

On the evening of the 22nd, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China held another telephone conference on autumn plowing and autumn planting, proposing that autumn plowing and autumn planting are the overriding central task of current agricultural production. While the "steel marshal" is being enthroned, it is required that Party committee secretaries at all levels personally take command and go out to battle, deeply mobilizing the masses to continue to展开(zhǎnkāi) debates, seize the agricultural season, accelerate the speed of autumn plowing, and emphasize the quality of autumn plowing, while also doing a good job in land preparation, moisture conservation, and fertilizer accumulation.

Xinhua News Agency reported that Jilin Province, with the mass movement of pulling out white flags and planting red flags, has launched a high tide of deep plowing. The daily progress of deep plowing in the province has now reached more than 160,000 hectares. As of the 22nd, a total of more than 1,810,000 hectares have been deeply plowed, accounting for 59.2% of the planned plowing area in various places.

The deep plowing campaign in Jilin Province has generally surged up only in the last ten days. This is the result of deeply mobilizing the masses, carrying out large-scale airing of views, debates, and resolutely pulling out white flags and planting red flags in various places. This struggle is continuing to deepen.

Since the province began deep plowing in late September, various places have generally encountered various forms of resistance, especially those right-leaning conservative ideas, which seriously hindered the rapid development of the deep plowing campaign. Before October 5th, the province only deeply plowed more than 10,000 hectares per day, and the quality was also very poor. Under the leadership of the provincial Party committee, the Party committees in various places, according to the instructions of Deng Xiaoping and other comrades, quickly mobilized the masses and launched a struggle to pull out white flags and plant red flags. Many places started from summarizing past production experiences and lessons, using facts to educate cadres and the masses. After the masses were ideologically armed, they powerfully冲击 (chōngjī) skeptics. For a small number of cadres with extremely serious right-leaning conservative ideas who had not changed (mainly those with rich middle peasant backgrounds), Party organizations in various places, based on the demands of the masses, removed them from their positions and elected those who strived for advancement and resolutely implemented the Party's "Constitution" for agricultural production, thereby making the progress of deep plowing several times to dozens of times faster, and the quality was also greatly improved. After the Party branch secretary of the Sixth Work Area of Taiping Township in Shuangyang County, who had serious right-leaning ideas, was removed from his post, the township increased from plowing only a dozen mu of land per day to more than 2,200 mu of land. In the past, the deep plowing progress in Baojia Work Area of Nong'an County only reached 50% of the plan. After pulling out white flags and planting red flags, it has already exceeded the plan by 90%.

The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on deep plowing on the 18th. Wu De, the first secretary of the provincial Party committee, requested at the meeting that all localities must seize the approximately twenty days before the freeze, ensuring that all good land is deeply plowed, striving to plow all arable land once, and laying a good foundation for a great leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    抓紧农时，加速秋耕！
    内蒙古吉林翻地运动进入高潮
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区农业和半农半牧区的各族农民，正在突击深翻土地。到10月20日，北从大兴安岭山下，南到鄂尔多斯农村，上百万的农民大军已经耕出农田二千八百六十九万多亩，占今年秋耕计划的54.8％。
    今年内蒙古的秋耕运动，是在大搞钢铁生产和农业空前丰收的条件下进行的。全区三百二十多万劳动力中约有三分之一投入了钢铁生产；而今年的粮食产量比去年增产一点三倍以上，秋收工作量也空前繁重。各级党政部门根据这种情况，对钢铁、秋收和秋耕的劳动力作了统一部署和安排，使之齐头并进。内蒙古党委并组织了六千多人的钢铁、秋收、秋耕工作队和劳动大队，分赴各旗县农村工作。现在各旗、县、乡和人民公社大都成立了秋耕办公室或指挥部，动员一切可能参加秋耕的劳动力投入秋耕运动。许多人民公社还推行了
  “六到田”（指挥到田、吃到田、住到田、开会辩论到田、学习到田、娱乐到田）和换人换牛不歇犁的办法，夜以继日地翻耕土地。
    打破“条件论”、“怀疑论”和“渐进论”等保守思想，是内蒙古秋耕深耕运动得以猛烈开展的重要原因。突泉县除发动社员大辩论外，还把当地几年来秋耕和深耕的好处，作了调查和总结。调查结果证明：秋耕地能增产15％到100％，耕过的地不仅第一年增产，第二年、第三年仍能增产。运用这些实例，这个县召开了现场会议，举办了秋翻训练班，立即在全县掀起了秋翻突击月，现在经常有两万人进行秋翻夜战。
    在深耕运动中，自治区各族牧民也进行了大力支援。巴彦淖尔盟牧区支援农区牛、马等耕畜近万头，并用许多骆驼参加深耕。哲里木盟利用了半农半牧区的四万头散畜耕地。现在全区参加深耕的散畜约有十万头。有些人民公社还发挥了共产主义协作精神，把剩余耕畜支援兄弟公社秋耕。
    今年内蒙古将秋耕农田五千二百三十万亩，占明年播种面积的87.1％，这是内蒙古耕作制度上的一项伟大变革，也是明年更大丰收的重要保证。
    22日晚，中共内蒙古自治区委员会又召开了秋耕秋种电话会议，提出秋耕秋种是当前农业生产压倒一切的中心。在钢铁元帅升帐同时，要求各级党委书记亲自挂帅出征，深入发动群众继续展开辩论，抓紧农时，加快秋耕速度，并强调秋耕质量，同时作好整地保墒及积肥工作。
    据新华社讯　吉林省随着拔白旗、插红旗的群众运动掀起了深翻地高潮。全省深翻地的日进度现在已达十六万多公顷，到22日止共已深翻一百八十一万多公顷，占各地计划翻耕面积的59.2％。
    吉林省深翻地运动是最近十天才普遍高涨起来的，这是各地经过深入发动群众，开展大鸣大放大辩论，坚决拔白旗、插红旗的结果。这个斗争正在继续深入。
    全省从9月下旬开始深翻地以来，各地普遍遇到了形形色色的抵触思想，特别是那些右倾保守思想，严重地阻碍了深翻地运动的迅速开展。10月5日前，全省每天深翻地仅一万多公顷，质量也很差。各地党委在省委领导下，根据邓小平等同志的指示，迅速发动群众，开展了拔白旗、插红旗的斗争。许多地方从总结过去的生产经验教训入手，用事实向干部、群众进行教育。群众在思想上武装起来以后，有力地冲击了怀疑论者。对于少数右倾保守思想极为严重而又无转变的干部（其中主要是富裕中农成分），各地党组织都根据群众的要求，撤销了他们的职务，选上了力争上游，坚决执行党的农业生产“宪法”的人，从而使深翻地的进度快了数倍到数十倍，质量也大大提高。双阳县太平乡第六作业区有严重右倾思想的党支部书记被撤职后，全乡就由每天只翻十多亩地提高到二千二百多亩地。农安县鲍家作业区原先深翻地进度只达到计划的50％，拔白旗插红旗以后，已经超额90％完成计划。
    中共吉林省委18日召开了深翻地电话会议。省委第一书记吴德在会上要求各地务必抓紧封冻前约二十天的时间，保证把好地都深翻完，争取全部耕地都翻一遍，为明年农业生产大翻身打好基础。
