To Do a Good Job, One Must First Sharpen One's Tools
    Greatly Improve Deep Ploughing Farm Tools, Transform the Fertile Land of Sichuan
    Hand Over Manufacturing Techniques to the Masses, Teach Deep Ploughing Methods to Women, Overcome Difficulties in Technology and Labor
    Chengdu, October 17th (Reported by our correspondent Sun Yuedong): Sichuan Province is universally carrying out a mass farm tool reform movement centered on deep ploughing, further accelerating the speed of deep ploughing and improving the quality of cultivation. As of the 15th, the province had deeply ploughed 19.45 million mu of land. Generally, the depth of ploughing is more than one chi (foot), and the high-yield fields have been deeply ploughed several chi.

    With the development of deep ploughing, the farm tool reform in the province has entered a new stage. Many areas are manufacturing and modifying deep ploughing farm tools at a rapid pace. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts including Nanchong, more than 300,000 various modified deep ploughing plows have been promoted. In a very short period of time, three special districts including Fuling, Wenjiang, and Nanchong have promoted more than 30,000 rope-traction machines. Among them, more than 8,000 in Wenjiang Special District were manufactured and promoted in the last eight days. Xichong, Dayi and other counties fought hard for five or six days and nights to realize rope-traction mechanization throughout the county, ensuring that each production team had a traction machine. These traction machines come in various styles, including those pushed by people, hand-cranked, foot-operated, and powered by livestock. In order to overcome the shortage of tools in deep ploughing, farmers in various places have also slightly modified the original old-fashioned plows to make simple deep ploughing plows. Dazhou County modified the original walking plow into large-curved, improved, double-layered, and triple-layered deep ploughing plows, which ploughed three or four cun (inches) deeper than before. Xichong, Langzhong and other counties also created potato-digging plows, which both dug sweet potatoes and carried out deep ploughing, achieving two goals at once.

    All localities promptly summarized the various creations of the masses in deep ploughing tools and handed over the manufacturing techniques to the masses through on-site meetings, field visits, and other methods, and promoted mass manufacturing. In order to solve the difficulty of the shortage of technical personnel after most of the iron and woodworkers were transferred to engage in steel production, the people's communes adopted methods such as skilled workers leading novices, masters teaching apprentices, and opening short-term training classes to impart iron and woodworking techniques to the masses. In the manufacturing of rope-traction machines in many communes in Dayi County, a woodworking assembly line method was adopted, in which technical workers drew lines according to the dimensions on the drawings and guided the apprentices to do the work, or the masters did the fine work and technically strong work, and the apprentices did the rough work. The Heming People's Commune in this county used these methods to manufacture 75 traction machines in two days and two nights, achieving the requirement of an average of one machine for every 50 mu of land.

    Various localities also paid attention to training female laborers to quickly master deep ploughing techniques and invest in deep ploughing in a timely manner. Among the more than 60,000 women in Mianyang County who have been invested in deep ploughing, more than 11,000 have learned the technique of plowing fields with cattle. Almost all of the more than 300 young plowmen originally assigned to Shima Township participated in steelmaking, so more than 300 women immediately learned to plow fields and took over their work.

    The innovation of cultivation tools and methods in various parts of Sichuan has greatly accelerated the speed of deep ploughing and improved the quality of ploughing. After fully mobilizing the masses and promoting the improved farm tools in large quantities, Suining Special District is advancing at a rate of more than 200,000 mu of deep ploughing per day, which is twice as fast as the previous stage. Although about half of the young and middle-aged labor force in Dayi County went to engage in steel production, the county still completely ploughed all 110,000 mu of rapeseed and wheat fields in ten days. Xichong County promoted 5,000 traction machines and deeply ploughed 100,000 mu of land in ten days, more than twice the amount of land deeply ploughed in the entire month of September.

### 大改深耕农具　天府大地翻身

    工欲善其事必须利其器
    大改深耕农具　天府大地翻身
    把制造技术交给群众，把深耕方法
    教会妇女，克服技术和劳力的困难
    本报成都17日电　记者孙跃冬报道：四川省普遍开展以深翻为中心的群众性农具改革运动，进一步加快了深翻地的速度，提高了耕作质量。全省到15日止，已经深翻土地一千九百四十五万亩。一般深翻一尺以上，丰产田深翻了几尺。
    随着深耕工作的开展，全省农具改革进入新的阶段。许多地区制造和改装深耕农具的速度很快。据南充等八个专区的不完全统计，推广了各种改装的深耕犁三十多万部。涪陵、温江、南充等三个专区，在极短的时间内，就推广绳索牵引机三万多部。其中温江专区有八千多部是在最近八天之内制造推广的。西充、大邑等县，都是苦战五、六昼夜，在全县实现绳索牵引机化，作到每个生产队都有牵引机。这些牵引机的样式各式各样，有人推的、手摇的、脚踏的和使用畜力的等。为了克服深耕中工具不足的困难，各地农民还将原有的旧式犁稍加改装，制成简易深耕犁。达县将原有步犁改装成大湾式、改良式、双层、三层等样式深耕犁，比原来深耕三、四寸。西充、阆中等县还创造了挖薯犁，在挖红薯的同时，又进行了深耕，一举两得。
    各地都及时将群众在深耕工具上的种种创造，进行总结，通过现场会议、田野参观等方式，将制作技术交给群众，大量推广制造。为了解决大部分铁、木工调去搞钢铁以后出现的技术人员缺少的困难，各人民公社都采用熟手带生手、师傅教徒弟、开短时训练班等办法，把铁、木工技术传授给群众。大邑县许多公社在制造绳索牵引机中，采用了木工流水作业法，由技术工人按图样尺寸划线，指导徒弟做，或由师傅做细活、技术性强的活，徒弟做粗活。这个县的鹤鸣人民公社，采用这些办法，两天两夜就制造牵引机七十五部，达到平均每五十亩田有一部的要求。
    各地还注意训练妇女劳动力迅速掌握深耕技术，及时投入深耕。绵阳县在投入深耕工作的六万多名妇女中，已有一万一千多人学会了使牛犁田的技术。石马乡原配备的三百多个青年犁田手，几乎都参加了炼钢炼铁，于是三百多个妇女立即学会犁田，接替了他们的工作。
    四川各地耕作工具和方法的革新，大大加快了深耕的速度，提高了翻地质量。遂宁专区在充分发动群众和大量推广改良农具以后，每天以深耕二十多万亩的速度前进，比前一阶段进度加快一倍。大邑县虽然一半左右的青壮年劳动力都去搞钢铁，全县仍在十天之内全部翻完十一万亩油菜田和麦田。西充县推广了牵引机五千部，十天内深耕了十万亩地，比9月份全月深耕的土地多一倍以上。
