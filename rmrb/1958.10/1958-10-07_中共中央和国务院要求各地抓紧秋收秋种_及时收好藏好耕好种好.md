Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council's Emergency Notice on Seizing the Autumn Harvest and Planting Work

    I. Currently, the early autumn harvest has been completed in various regions, and the late autumn harvest is beginning. About half of the autumn plowing task in wheat-producing areas has been completed. Wheat planting work has generally started in the Yellow River and Huai River basins. Most regions have implemented Chairman Mao's instruction of "Don't abandon agriculture while vigorously developing steel production," grasping both steel and agriculture, and the progress of the three autumn tasks is relatively fast. However, in some regions, the labor force arrangements have not been taken into account comprehensively. Some crops are ripe but have not been harvested in time, resulting in falling grains and germination; cotton is ripe but has not been picked in time, suffering from wind and rain; a considerable amount of fertilizer has been accumulated for autumn planting, but a large quantity has not been transported to the fields in time. This situation must be changed immediately.
    II. The fruits of this year's agricultural harvest must be fully reaped. Various preparatory works for achieving a greater leap forward next year must also begin as soon as possible. All regions should make arrangements for the labor force. During the tense period of the autumn harvest and planting, in addition to vigorously developing steel production, they should seize the opportunity to organize shock work for the timely autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, which are very time-sensitive, and promptly harvest, store, cultivate, and plant well. Other matters that can be handled later can be postponed as appropriate to ensure that the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting are completed quickly and well. All these tasks should be seized in the agricultural season and should not be delayed. All regions are required to immediately organize inspections to ensure the completion of tasks on time.
    III. All regions should organize forces to rush harvest and meticulously harvest, ensuring timely harvesting and striving for every grain to return to the granary. Cotton and potatoes should be harvested more promptly to prevent spoilage and loss. Potato-concentrated production areas should make all preparations to ensure good harvesting, storage, and utilization. While celebrating this year's great agricultural harvest, it is necessary to prevent the erroneous idea that it does not matter if a little is lost in a bumper harvest, and to truly achieve bumper yields and bumper harvests.
    IV. In order to complete the task of increasing grain, cotton, and oilseed production next year, it is necessary to ensure the completion of the sown area while striving to increase the yield per unit area. This year, the autumn soil moisture in most areas is very good. Wheat and rapeseed must be planted in time while there is sufficient moisture, and deep plowing and sufficient base fertilizer should be applied carefully. If the soil moisture is not good, it is necessary to water the base moisture well to achieve close planting and full seedlings. All overwintering crops must be planted on deeply plowed land to effectively improve the planting quality. Cotton-concentrated production areas should comprehensively arrange the production layout and reserve next year's cotton fields to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil next year.

### 中共中央和国务院要求各地抓紧秋收秋种  及时收好藏好耕好种好

    中共中央和国务院要求各地抓紧秋收秋种
    及时收好藏好耕好种好
    新华社6日讯　中共中央　国务院关于抓紧秋收秋种工作的紧急通知
    一、目前各地早秋已经收完，正在开始收获晚秋。产麦区秋田深耕任务已经完成一半左右。黄河淮河流域种麦工作已经普遍开始。多数地区执行了毛主席“在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉”的指示，一手抓钢铁，一手抓农业，三秋工作进度较快。但也有些地区，在劳力安排上没有照顾到全面，有些庄稼熟了，没有及时收获，发生落粒发芽等现象；棉花成熟了，没有及时采摘，受到风吹雨淋；秋种肥料积的不少，但有很大数量没有及时运到地里。这种情况必须立即改变。
    二、今年农业丰收果实必须全部拿到手里。为着明年实现更大跃进的各项准备工作，也须及早动手。各地应当做好劳动力的安排，在秋收秋种紧张时期，除大搞钢铁生产以外，对时间性很紧迫的秋收、秋耕、秋种工作，要抓紧时机组织突击，及时收好、藏好、耕好、种好。其他可以缓办的事，都可以酌量推迟一步再办，保证把秋收、秋耕、秋种完成得又快又好。所有这些工作，都应抓紧农时，不能迟缓，要求各地立即组织检查，保证按时完成任务。
    三、各地要组织力量抢收、细收、保证及时收获，争取颗粒还仓。棉花和薯类更要及时收获，防止霉坏损失。薯类集中产区要做好一切准备工作，保证收好、藏好、利用好。在庆祝今年农业大丰收的同时，要防止认为丰收了损失一点无关要紧的错误思想发生，切实做到丰产丰收。
    四、为了完成明年增产粮食、棉花和油料的任务，必须在力争提高单位面积产量的同时，保证完成播种面积。今年大部地区秋季墒情很好，小麦和油菜必须及时趁墒多种，并且认真搞好深耕，施足底肥。墒情不好的要浇好底墒水，做到密植全苗。所有越冬农作物都要种在深翻地上，切实提高播种质量。棉花集中产区要全面安排生产布局，预留明年的棉田，做到明年粮、棉、油全面丰收。
                                一九五八年十月六日
