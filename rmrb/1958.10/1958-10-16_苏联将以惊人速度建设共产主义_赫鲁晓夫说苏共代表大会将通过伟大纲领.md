Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 15th: TASS, Moscow, October 15th: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, pointed out in a speech in Stavropol on the 14th that the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will present us with great tasks, which will show that the figures of the Soviet economic development in the next seven years are simply unimaginable. He said that when these figures are announced, the whole world will be amazed by the prospects of socialist economic development.

Khrushchev made a speech at a meeting in Stavropol Territory on the 14th where the region was awarded the Order of Lenin. He pointed out that the 21st Congress of the CPSU will adopt a program for the development of the Soviet economy in the construction of communism in the next seven years. This will be a great and inspiring program.

Khrushchev said that the Seven-Year Plan is a great program for building communism. If our enemies used to say that the Soviet economic development plan was bragging and fantasy, they would not dare to say such things now.

Khrushchev said that in recent years, the Soviet people have made great achievements in developing agriculture. This has greatly increased the production of agricultural products and improved the material well-being of the working people. As of October 10th this year, collective farms and state farms sold 1.487 billion poods more grain to the state than in the same period in 1953.

The national purchase of meat was 62% more than in the same period in 1953, and milk was doubled.

Speaking of the achievements of agricultural workers in Stavropol Territory, he particularly pointed out the initiative of establishing student teams in collective farms. In this regard, he emphasized the special role of labor education. He pointed out that young people must be prepared to complete all the work needed by society.

Khrushchev then pointed out that the achievements of Soviet industry are very good. The main task now is to comprehensively develop the Soviet economy and improve the people's living standards on this basis.

A large part of Khrushchev's speech dealt with the international situation. He said that the forces of peace and socialism have greatly increased, and the world socialist camp is unprecedentedly strong and united. The imperialists' attempts to launch a war have been strongly opposed by peace-loving people of all countries.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that the achievements of Soviet workers, collective farmers, scientists and intellectuals have strengthened the forces of socialism. These achievements not only strengthened the Soviet Union, but also strengthened the power of all progressive mankind in the struggle to defend peace, oppose aggressors, and oppose imperialism. We now have all the conditions to achieve new victories.

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: TASS Stavropol: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, arrived in Stavropol (in the North Caucasus) on the 13th.

Stavropol Territory was awarded the Order of Lenin on October 8th this year for its achievements in increasing the production of grain and other agricultural products, and for successfully fulfilling its obligation to deliver three million poods of grain to the state.

On the way to Stavropol, Khrushchev visited some collective farms in the Nevinnomyssk district.

    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科15日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫14日在斯塔夫罗波尔城发表演说时指出，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会将向我们提出伟大的任务，这些任务将表明，今后七年中苏联经济发展的数字简直是难以想像的。他说，当这些数字公布时，全世界都将为社会主义经济发展的前景而感到惊讶。
    赫鲁晓夫14日在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区荣获列宁勋章的集会上发表了演说。他指出，苏共第二十一次代表大会将通过苏联在今后七年共产主义建设中发展经济的纲领。这将是伟大的和鼓舞人心的纲领。
    赫鲁晓夫说，七年计划是共产主义建设的伟大纲领。如果以前我们的敌人说，苏联的经济发展计划是吹牛、是幻想，那么现在他们就不敢再说这样的话了。
    赫鲁晓夫说，最近几年，苏联人民在发展农业方面取得了巨大成就。这使得农产品的生产大大增加，劳动人民的物质福利提高了。截至今年10月10日，集体农庄和国营农场出售给国家的粮食比1953年同一时期多十四亿八千七百万普特。
    全国采购的肉类比1953年同一时期多62％，牛奶多一倍。
    在谈到斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区农业劳动者的成就时，他特别指出在集体农庄成立学生队的倡议。在这方面他强调了劳动教育的特别作用。他指出，青年们必须准备完成社会所需要的一切工作。
    赫鲁晓夫接着指出，苏联工业的成绩很好。现在的主要任务是全面发展苏联经济，并在这个基础上提高人民的生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫的演说有很大一部分谈到了国际局势问题。他说，和平和社会主义力量有了很大增长，世界社会主义阵营空前强大和团结。帝国主义者发动战争的企图遭到爱好和平的各国人民的有力反对。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家和知识分子的成就增强了社会主义力量。这些成就不仅增强了苏联的力量，而且增强了为维护和平、反对侵略者、反对帝国主义者而斗争的全体进步人类的力量。我们现在有一切条件来获得新的胜利。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社斯塔夫罗波尔讯：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫13日到达斯塔夫罗波尔（在北高加索）。赫鲁晓夫同志此行是为了向斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区授予列宁勋章。
    由于在提高谷物和其他农产品产量方面所获得的成就，以及由于胜利实现向国家交售三百万普特粮食的义务，斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区于今年10月8日荣获了列宁勋章。
    在去斯塔夫罗波尔的路上，赫鲁晓夫访问了涅文诺梅斯克区一些集体农庄。
