    Must Start from Elementary School
    Jiang Yin
    The realization of communism in our country is no longer a distant future event. One of the necessary conditions for realizing communism is the elimination of the difference between mental and physical labor. The main preparation for eliminating this difference is to implement the policy of combining education with productive labor in education work, and to cultivate new communist people who are capable in both intellectual and physical work. Childhood is the preparatory stage for a person's ideology. If every child can be enabled to participate in productive labor within their capacity from an early age, and receive communist education that combines mental and physical labor, then the new communist people we cultivate will be healthier in their thinking. Marx said long ago: "Under a reasonable social system, every child should become a productive worker from the age of nine." He also said: "The early combination of productive labor and education is one of the most powerful means of transforming modern society."
    Some people believe that elementary school students are too young and physically weak, and they only need to study hard and do not need to participate in productive labor. This understanding is wrong. It is true that elementary school students are young and physically weak, however, it is absolutely necessary to guide them to participate in productive labor within their capacity. Under the past education system, elementary school students have already been influenced by bourgeois ideology. One can often hear some elementary school students saying seriously with childish faces: I want to be a great scientist in the future. But one rarely hears elementary school students say that they want to be ordinary laborers. That is to say, elementary school students have already begun to separate mental and physical labor, and fail to realize that greatness comes from the ordinary, and knowledge comes from practice. If the combination of mental and physical labor is not started from elementary school education, then it will have to be started from scratch in middle school, and the wrong perceptions of their childhood will have to be reversed.
    People often say that children are the flowers of the motherland. Indeed, our country and people care for children like they care for flowers, with meticulous care. However, what we need are not flowers in a greenhouse, but flowers that can heroically build communism. We should not only let elementary school students learn book knowledge in the classroom, but also let them apply book knowledge to practice, and let these flowers of the motherland draw nourishment from the ocean of living knowledge, so that they can grow stronger and more vigorously.
    Of course, the main purpose of elementary school students participating in productive labor is to cultivate their love for labor and learn some labor skills. Elementary school students are young and physically weak, therefore, schools must arrange some labor that suits their physical strength and can cultivate their interests in various aspects, therefore, labor should be diversified. The Sixth Malu Elementary School in Siping City has established a Young Pioneers' small factory. Many students, through a variety of productive labor, have not only learned a lot of production knowledge and corrected their learning attitudes, but have also gradually cultivated a habit of loving labor. In the children's hearts, they have cultivated a love for the collective and a love for the school. This is the growth of communist thought. This fact shows that elementary school education can be combined with productive labor, and must be combined with productive labor, because only in this way can children become true, healthy, and future communist builders.

    要从小学开始
    江音
    共产主义在我国的实现，已经不是遥远将来的事情。实现共产主义的必要条件之一，是消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。消灭这一差别的主要准备工作，是在教育工作中，贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，培养能文能武的共产主义新人。儿童时代，是人的思想意识的准备阶段。如果能够使每个儿童从小就参加力所能及的生产劳动，受到脑力劳动和体力劳动结合的共产主义教育。那么，我们所培养的共产主义新人在思想上将更健康。马克思早就说过：“在合理的社会制度下，每个儿童从九岁起都应当成为生产工作者”。他又说：“生产劳动和教育的早期结合是改造现代社会的最强有力的手段之一。”
    有些人认为，小学生的年龄太小，体力单薄，只要他们好好读书就行了，不必让他们参加生产劳动。这种认识是错误的。小学生的年龄小，体力单薄，这是事实，然而，引导他们去参加力所能及的生产劳动，却是完全必要的。在过去的教育制度下，小学生已经受了资产阶级的思想影响。人们常常可以听到一些小学生带着满脸稚气认真地说：我，将来要做一个伟大的科学家。却不常听到小学生说他要作一个普通的劳动者。这也就是说，小学生们已经开始把脑力劳动和体力劳动分割开来，认识不到伟大出自平凡，知识出自实践。如果不从小学教育开始，就使脑力劳动和体力劳动结合，那么，到了中学，就要从头作起，并且还要把他们幼年时代的错误认识扭转过来。
    人们常说，儿童是祖国的花朵，的确，我们的国家和人民爱护儿童像爱护花朵一样，真是无微不至。但是，我们需要的不是暖室里的花朵，而是能英雄地建设共产主义的花朵。我们不仅要让小学生在课堂上学习书本知识，而且要把他们把书本知识用于实践，让这祖国的花朵到活的知识的海洋里汲取滋养，使他们成长得更加茁壮，更加朝气蓬勃。
    当然，小学生参加生产劳动，主要是培养他们热爱劳动，并学得一些劳动技能。小学生的年龄小，体力单薄，因此，学校必须安排一些适合他们体力，能培养他们各方面的兴趣的劳动，因此，劳动要多样化。四平市六马路小学开办红领巾小工厂，许多学生通过多种多样的生产劳动，不仅学习到不少生产知识，端正了学习态度，而且已经逐渐培养了爱劳动的习惯，在孩子们的心灵里，培养了热爱集体，热爱学校的感情，这就是共产主义思想的成长。这一事实说明，小学教育可以结合生产劳动，也必须结合生产劳动，因为只有这样，才能使儿童成为真正的未来的身心健康的共产主义建设者。
