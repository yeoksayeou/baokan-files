    The Struggle Between Two Roads in Textbook Reform
    Tang Shaowen, Zheng Zhong
    In order to compile a set of textbooks to serve Henan Province's agricultural leap forward, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry organized some teachers and school leaders to comprehensively reform the previous teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks. The textbook reform process was filled with the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, the socialist road and the capitalist road, the mass line working method and the bureaucratic subjectivist working method.
    When compiling textbooks, should we rely on the old method of only using existing books and materials, and writing in the office? Or should we break out of the old circle, collect a large amount of vivid material from real life and production, in addition to reading necessary books and materials, to enrich the content of the textbooks? At the beginning of compiling teaching plans, syllabuses, and textbooks, we first encountered various ideological obstacles on this issue. Some people thought, "I study agricultural machinery, I should go to big factories in the city, what's the point of rural agricultural tool reform?" Teachers who teach general courses believe that it is best to go to universities or high schools, what is the use of going to the countryside? Professional course teachers do not first become students of the masses when they go down, but act as imperial envoys, etc. Regarding these ideological problems, on the one hand, we organized airing of views, debates, and the removal of stagnation; on the other hand, we resolutely organized teachers to go to the grassroots level of production to learn from the vast number of advanced industrial and agricultural producers, summarize their valuable experience in production struggles, study the key to their increased production, and ask advanced producers for advice, acting as good students. Facts have proved that this measure is completely correct. Because many teachers have been separated from production reality for a long time, it is impossible to compile good textbooks without going down. For example, the teaching syllabus compiled by some majors initially had certain crops' teaching focus and certain theories in the textbooks that did not conform to the actual production situation at all. Nearly two months of rural surveys collected 3,193 materials, and summarized 340 advanced production experiences and high-yield typical examples. With rich materials, not only did the compilation of textbooks greatly accelerated, but also the quality of the textbooks was improved. After many teachers personally saw and heard about the deeds of advanced production, they said: "Two and a half months of visits and investigations are better than reading books for ten years." This laid a good foundation for compiling new teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks.
    Where do we find the basis for compiling textbooks? Initially, some people believed that only book knowledge was true knowledge, and only it was reliable; experts' words were the basis and the truth; they despised the power of the masses, did not see the great innovations of the masses in agricultural production, and believed that these were low-level things and could not be selected into the textbooks. When compiling crop cultivation, some people suggested compiling it based on a certain professor's cultivation. Some people believe that compiling textbooks is just copying books, and it is considered good if you copy well. What was the result? The compiled corn was all technical theories of 300 to 500 catties, and the cotton textbooks cited materials from Siam and India. Putting aside the issue of its high or low yield and its theory, Siam has long changed its name on the world map, isn't this a joke? The Party organization promptly analyzed this situation, reorganized some teachers to visit and study at production sites and exhibition halls, and launched debates. For example, botany used to believe that some content had to be copied from books. We pointed out that the original theory of botany believes that plants basically do not absorb nutrients after flowering. However, many facts have denied this statement, such as the wheat with a yield of 7,320 catties per mu in Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County, which irrigated after flowering to promote plump wheat grains and achieved a bumper harvest. Obviously, it is wrong to copy the old theory again. Also, some people believe that technical measures for cultivation can be changed, but the morphology of crops must be copied. In response to this situation, we organized everyone to visit a sorghum plant. This sorghum plant yielded 60 catties, and its morphology had undergone qualitative changes, which shows that the morphology of crops must also be explained with new theories and cannot be copied from old books. Through debate, the dogmatic method of writing was fundamentally overcome.
    Oriented towards production, oriented towards the region, oriented towards the countryside, this is our guideline for editing textbooks. However, in the process of compiling textbooks, there was also a struggle on this issue. For example, those who compiled agricultural mechanization textbooks emphasized that this course cannot be combined with production reality, and can only compile highly mechanized materials, not semi-mechanized materials. If they compile indigenous methods to improve agricultural tools, it would be even more inappropriate. They look down on the role of small improved agricultural tools in agricultural production at this stage. This situation exists to varying degrees in other majors. In fact, every textbook can and must be combined with production reality. Taking agricultural machinery as an example, the deep plowing plow created by farmers in Changge County, the improved harvester, and various water lifting tools have various advantages that highly mechanized agricultural tools do not have. These tools can immediately solve the problem of electricity in rural areas, and hand-cranked and foot-pedaled tools can promote the agricultural leap forward and enable rural areas to move towards semi-mechanization and mechanization at a faster speed. How can we say that agricultural machinery cannot be combined with production, and cannot select these meaningful reforms into textbooks?
    There is also debate about whether textbooks can be compiled quickly, and whether it is possible to do well if it is compiled quickly. At that time, the leaders proposed that textbooks for all subjects in senior, middle, and junior agricultural schools should be compiled by the end of July. Some people thought this was impossible. Some said that each book has tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of words, and it would take a month just to copy it. Liu Zuotang, the director of teaching affairs at Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School who participated in the compilation of textbooks, openly ridiculed the leap forward measures proposed by some people as "Ah Q spirit" and "a beggar with a bun in his arms, fooling himself." A powerful rebuttal was also given to these arguments, and the masses were relied upon to find a way to compile quickly, well, and economically. For example, the comrades who compiled the corn textbook spent a few days flipping through a lot of materials, but still couldn't find the key to increasing corn production. So the comrades of the cultivation group had a discussion with the agricultural bureau technicians, and as a result, the problem was fundamentally solved in less than two hours. The textbook on commune management was compiled using a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. The teachers who compiled the textbook studied together with local experts at the Suiping Satellite Commune, Xinxiang Qiliying People's Commune, etc., and quickly completed the compilation task and made the textbook highlight the key points.
    The ability to compile so many textbooks that conform to the Party's education policy in a short period of five months is the result of realizing political leadership, the Party organization consistently strengthening political and ideological leadership, and launching a struggle between two roads. Throughout the entire process of compiling textbooks, the Party organization has always used the powerful weapons of airing views freely, big-character posters, and big debates to fully mobilize the masses and promptly resolve ideological disputes and practical problems in compiling textbooks. In addition, the Party branch also adopted the leadership method of setting up "experimental fields" and "grasping both ends and leading the middle" to create a wave of learning from advanced and catching up with advanced. The progress of compiling textbooks is always uneven, some are ahead and some are behind. After several debates, it was found that some textbooks from plant protection, mathematics, and crop cultivation groups were compiled better. The Party branch promptly organized experience exchanges. Advanced groups and advanced individuals introduced their methods of compiling outlines and textbooks, and introduced their better-compiled textbooks. There was no compromise to backward ideas either, and earnest criticism was launched, red flags were planted, the direction of the wind was distinguished, and proletarian ideology was promoted and bourgeois ideology was eliminated, which greatly accelerated the textbook compilation work.

    教材改革中两条道路的斗争
    汤绍文　郑重
    为了编写一套为河南省农业跃进服务的教材，河南省农林厅组织了一部分教师和学校的领导同志对已往的教学计划、教学大纲、教材进行了全面的改革。在进行教材改革的过程中，充满无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想，社会主义道路与资本主义道路的斗争，群众路线的工作方法和官僚主义主观主义的工作方法的斗争。
    编写教材是以老的方法，只靠现成的图书资料，坐在办公室里编写呢？还是跳出旧圈子，除了阅读必要的图书资料以外，再从现实生活、生产当中收集大量活生生的材料，使教材的内容丰富多采？编写教学计划、大纲、教材之初，首先在这个问题上就遇到种种思想障碍。有的人认为，我是学农业机械的，应当到城市大工厂去，乡村的农具改革有啥学头；教普通课的教师认为最好到大学或高中去，到农村有啥用；专业课的教师下去不是先做群众的学生，而是做钦差大臣，等等。对于这些思想问题，一方面组织鸣放，辩论、扫除暮气，一方面坚决组织教师到生产基层中去，向广大的工农业先进生产者学习，把他们生产斗争的宝贵经验加以总结，研究他们增产的关键，向先进生产者请教，当个好学生。事实证明，这一措施是完全正确的。由于许多教师长期和生产实际脱离，不下去是不可能编出好的教材来的，例如，最初有的专业编的教学大纲中所拟的某些作物的讲授重点，教材中所讲的某些理论，与生产实际情况根本不符合。将近两个月的农村调查，搜集了三千一百九十三种资料，总结了三百四十个先进生产经验和高额丰产典型。有了丰富的资料，不仅大大加快教材的编写，而且也提高了教材的质量。许多教师亲自看到和听到了先进生产的事迹以后说：“参观调查两月半，胜读十年书。”这给编写新的教学计划、教学大纲、教科书打下了良好的基础。
    编写教材从哪里找根据？最初有些人认为只有书本知识才是真知识，才稳妥可靠，专家的话，就是根据就是真理，轻视群众的力量，对于群众在农业生产中的伟大创造革新看不到眼里，认为这是低级的东西，不能选入教材。编写作物栽培学时，有人就提出以某某教授的栽培学为蓝本进行编写。有的认为编写教材就是抄书，抄的好就算不错了。结果怎样呢？编写的玉米都是三百斤五百斤的技术理论，编的棉花教材举的是暹逻、印度的材料。姑且不谈它的产量高低，它的理论如何，暹逻在世界地图上早已改变了名称，这不是笑话吗？党组织及时分析了这一情况，重新组织了部分教师到生产现场，到展览馆进行参观学习，并展开辩论。如植物学过去认为有些内容非抄书不可，我们即提出植物学原来的理论认为植物开花以后基本上不吸收养分了，但是，有许多事实否定了这种说法，如西平县和平农业社亩产七千三百二十斤的小麦，在开花后灌浆水，促使小麦籽粒饱满，使小麦获得丰收，再照抄旧的理论，显然是不对的。又如也有人认为栽培的技术措施不抄可以，但作物的形态学却非抄不可。针对这种情况，我们就组织大家参观一棵高粱，这一棵高粱收了六十斤，它的形态已起了质的变化，由此说明作物的形态也必须要有新的理论加以阐明，不能照抄旧书。通过辩论，从根本上克服了教条主义的编写方法。
    面向生产，面向地区，面向农村，这是我们编辑教材的方针。但是在编写教材的过程中，在这个问题上也有斗争。例如，编农业机械化教材的就强调这门课程不能结合生产实际，只能编高度机械化，不能编半机械化，如果编土法改良农具那就更不像样子了。他们看不起小型的改良农具在现阶段对农业生产的作用。这种情况在其他专业也都不同程度的存在着。事实上每门教材都能结合而且也必须结合生产实际，就以农业机械来说，长葛县农民创造的深耕犁，改良收割机与各种提水工具，它具备了高度机械化农具所没有的各项优点。这些工具，在农村马上不能解决电力的情况下，手摇的、脚踏的就能促使农业生产大跃进，使农村以更快的速度，走向半机械化与机械化。这怎能说农业机械不能结合生产，不能把这些有意义的改革选入教材呢？
    编写教材能不能多快，快了能不能好，也有争论。当时领导上提出到7月底要编出高、中、初三级农业学校各科的教材，有些人认为这是不可能的，有的说每本书几万字、几十万字，光抄写也得一个月。参加编写教材工作的郑州农业机械化学校的教务科长刘祚堂，公然把有些人提出的跃进措施讥讽为“阿Q精神”“是讨饭的怀里放个馍，自己哄自己。”对于这些论调，也给予了有力的回击，并且依靠群众找到了多快好省的编写方法。如编写玉米教材的同志，搞了几天，翻了许多资料，但仍然找不出玉米增产的关键。于是栽培组的同志就和农业局技术人员在一起座谈，结果不到两小时就从根本上解决了问题。公社经营管理的教材是采取土洋结合的办法编出来的。编教材的教师在遂平卫星社、新乡七里营人民公社等和土专家一起研究，很快完成编写任务，并使教材重点突出。
    在短短的五个多月的时间，能够编出这样多而又符合党的教育方针的教材，是实现政治挂帅，党组织始终加强政治思想领导，展开了两条道路斗争的结果。在教材的整个编写过程中，党组织一直运用了大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论这一有力的武器，充分发动群众，及时解决思想上的争端和编写教材中的实际问题。另外，党支部也采取搞“试验田”“抓两头带中间”的领导方法，掀起学先进赶先进的热潮。编写教材的进度总是不平衡的，有先有后，经过几次辩论后，发现植物保护、数学、作物栽培小组的有些教材编写的较好，党支部及时组织了经验交流，先进小组、先进个人介绍了他们编写大纲、教材的方法，并介绍他们编写得较好的教材。对落后思想也毫不迁就，认真的展开批评，插红旗，辨风向，兴无灭资，才大大加快了教材编写工作。
