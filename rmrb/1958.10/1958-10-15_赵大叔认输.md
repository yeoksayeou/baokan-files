    Uncle Zhao Admits Defeat
    Li Guangwei, Sheet Metal Worker, Andong Agricultural Machinery Factory

    The corn was ripe. At harvest time, we came to the Iron Flow Farm again, and were once more assigned to the Fourth Production Team. I stayed in Uncle Zhao's home, just as I had during the summer planting. According to the plan, it would take the whole team four days to finish harvesting, but we young fellows were full of energy, and we finished harvesting the entire production team's corn before sunset on the second day. Uncle Zhao weighed it, and the average yield was 860 jin per mu. The old man grinned, "Not bad, lads, a whole double increase compared to last year!"

    "Team Leader Zhao, our team won't lose face, will we?" a female commune member shouted in a shrill voice.

    "Heh heh, lose face? Go ask around, the hoe handles that just Zhao Uncle alone has worn out are enough to burn for the whole commune for a year."

    This sentence made everyone laugh. I then asked, "Uncle Zhao, how's Li Lisheng's youth team doing?"

    "Rest assured, they won't exceed 800!" he said, stroking his beard with satisfaction.

    "Let's go take a look!"

    "Alright!" Uncle Zhao said, seeing that everyone was carrying corn back to the commune, and walked with me toward Li Lisheng's youth team.

    During the summer planting this year, the commune promoted narrow-row close planting, which Uncle Zhao didn't understand. He insisted on wide-row sparse planting. The commune advocated applying more fertilizer, but he said that too much fertilizer would burn the crops. The people from our factory who came to help with the summer planting all tried to persuade him, but he said, "Don't worry, I have decades of experience in planting crops. Don't listen to their nonsense. If I yield one jin less than them in the fall, I'll let you chop off my head."

    When we arrived at Li Lisheng's team, we happened to arrive just in time for weighing the corn. A large pile of corn cobs was finished weighing on the ground. The weigher said, "Six hundred and eighty!"

    "How about that?" Uncle Zhao nudged me with his elbow, satisfied.

    I was a little discouraged, thinking, can new technologies really not increase production? Just then, Li Lisheng walked over, and I ran up to him and asked, "Team Leader Li, you only harvested six hundred and eighty jin per mu?"

    Li Lisheng couldn't help but laugh at my anxious appearance. "Is six hundred and eighty jin anything to brag about? We're using new methods, you see over there!" He pointed to five more large piles of corn next to him and said, "Six hundred and eighty jin is only one-sixth of what we harvested on one mu!"

    Uncle Zhao's face turned pale in an instant upon hearing this. He stood there, not moving, until the commune's referee team finished weighing, and he heard the weigher shout, "Three thousand eight hundred and forty-six jin." He still didn't move, his eyes fixed on that golden pile of corn. I said, "Uncle Zhao, should I chop off your head, or will you do it yourself?"

    "Stop talking nonsense to me!" he suddenly turned to me and roared, his eyes blazing with anger, his face flushed red. In that instant, my face also turned red.

    Uncle Zhao turned and left. I looked at the quiet crowd, and quickly ran a few steps to catch up with him.

    By the edge of the field, Uncle Zhao slowed down, and I quickened my pace to apologize, saying, "Uncle, it's all my fault for being so talkative, please don't be angry!"

    Uncle Zhao suddenly stopped, paused for a long time, and then suddenly grabbed my shoulder, and sighed deeply: "Alas! It's all my fault. It's my fault for having this conservative mind. How could I not believe that corn can also benefit from narrow-row close planting, deep plowing, and applying more fertilizer? This is so embarrassing. I admit defeat!"

    I couldn't help but grasp his big hands and said:

    "Uncle! Don't be sad, you will definitely catch up next year..."

    赵大叔认输
    安东农业机械厂钣工　李光伟
    苞米熟了，收割的时候我们又来到铁流农庄，并且又都分配在第四生产队。我呢，就住在夏种时住过的赵大叔家。按计划全队要割四天才能割完，可是我们这帮小伙子干劲十足，第二天日头没落就把整个生产队的苞米割完了。赵大叔一称，平均每亩八百六，他老人家咧嘴乐了，“小伙子，不错吧，比去年足足增产一倍！”。
    “赵队长，咱们队不会丢脸吧？”女社员尖声喊着。
    “嘿嘿，丢脸？去问问吧，光赵大叔我磨断的锄把也够咱全社烧一年的。”
    这句话把所有的人都逗笑了。我接着问：“赵大叔，李力胜那个青年队怎么样？”
    “放心吧，不会超过八百！”他得意地捻着胡子说。
    “咱们看看去吧！”
    “好哇！”赵大叔说，看看大家都挑着苞米回社了，便同我向李力胜青年队走来。
    今年夏种时，社里推广窄垅密植，赵大叔不通，非要宽垅疏植不可；社里提倡多施肥，他说肥多会把庄稼烧死，我们工厂来帮助夏种的人们都劝他，可他说：“你们放心，种庄稼我有几十年经验，别听他们瞎嚷嚷，秋后要是比他们少一斤，我把脑袋揪给你们。”
    来到李力胜队里，刚好赶上过秤，地上一大堆苞米棒子过完了，司秤的说，“六百八！”
    “怎么样？”赵大叔满意地用胳膊肘撞我一下。
    我真有点丧气了，心想，新技术真的不能增产吗？刚好李力胜走过来，我迎面跑过去问：“李队长，你们一亩地就打六百八？”
    李力胜见我着急的样子禁不住噗哧笑了，“六百八还像话吗？咱们这是新方法呀，你看那边！”他指着旁边还有五大堆苞米说：“六百八仅仅是一亩地的六分之一！”
    赵大叔听见这话，脸唰地一下变色了。他站定在那里，直等到社里裁判小组过完秤，听见司秤员喊：“三千八百四十六斤。”他还是没有挪步，两眼一动不动的死盯着那金黄黄的苞米堆。我说：“赵大叔，你的脑袋是我给你揪呢，还是你自己揪？”
    “你少给我说废话！”他突然转向我大吼一声，两眼发着怒火，满脸通红。在这一瞬间我的脸也唰地一下红了。
    赵大叔扭身就走了，我望望静下来的群众，便紧跑几步追上去。
    在地头上，赵大叔放慢了脚步，我紧追两步道歉地说：“大叔，都怪我多嘴，你可千万千万别生气呀！”
    赵大叔突然停住步，停了好一会，他倏地握住我的肩头，深深地叹了口气：“唉！都怪我。怪我这个保守脑袋，我怎么就不相信苞米也能够窄垅密植、深翻土多施肥呢？这下子可丢人啦，我认输啦！”
    我禁不住握住他那双大手说：
    “大叔！你不要难过，明年一定会赶上前去的……”
