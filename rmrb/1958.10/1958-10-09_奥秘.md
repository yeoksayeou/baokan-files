　　“Mystery”
　　Many people are concerned about the "mystery" of the success of high-yield red flag units. The report on the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is an answer.

　　The excellence of the open hearth furnace workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant does not lie in its equipment conditions, but in its people. The workers in this workshop do not care about personal interests, they are not afraid of difficulties, they forge ahead bravely, and they can closely help and cooperate with each other... In short, it is filled with the spirit of communism.

　　This year's Great Leap Forward in our country is a mass movement of unprecedented scale under the leadership of the Party. This movement is essentially a communist ideological movement. Wherever the mass movement is booming, wherever there is more communist thought, there we can create more miracles. This is the "mystery" of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and other red flag units being able to lead the way in the Great Leap Forward, and it is also the "mystery" that all regions and all units can consciously grasp and use to reach the shore of victory!

    “奥秘”
    许多人关心高产红旗单位成功的“奥秘”。上钢三厂的报道是一个答复。
    上钢三厂平炉车间的优异之处，不在设备条件，而在于人。这个车间的工人都不计较私人的利益，都能不畏艰难，勇往直前，彼此能够密切地互助协作……总之是，共产主义精神洋溢。
    今年我们国家的大跃进，是一个在党的领导下的规模空前的群众运动。这个运动实质上是一个共产主义思想运动。哪里群众运动搞得红火，哪里共产主义思想多一些，哪里就能创造更多的奇迹。——这就是上钢三厂等红旗单位能够在大跃进中领先前进的“奥秘”，也是所有地区、所有单位可以自觉地掌握、借以达到胜利彼岸的“奥秘”！
