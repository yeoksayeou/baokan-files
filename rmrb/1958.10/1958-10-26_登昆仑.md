Climbing Kunlun, looking out, the motherland's mountains and rivers are all within view. One glance at the mountains and peaks fluttering with red flags, another look at the rivers smiling. Songs rise from the land, a beautiful and splendid country. Climbing Kunlun, looking at Sichuan, the golden basin is a vast plain. The north and south of Sichuan are filled with the fragrance of oil, the brave sons of Sichuan pledge: To drill through the ten thousand mountains of Sichuan, and erect a benchmark on Mount Emei. Climbing Kunlun, looking west, the Tianshan Mountains are covered in white snow. The fierce warriors of Karamay, with derricks standing like forests in the Gobi Desert. Drilling all over southern and northern Xinjiang, the red flag will forever be planted on the Tianshan Mountains. Climbing Kunlun, looking south, the Yumen Pass is a hive of activity. The old brother of the Yumen Oil Mine, a national model. All indicators are advanced, taking the lead in planting the benchmark. Climbing Kunlun, looking down, the Qaidam Basin's red flag shines brightly. The Qaidam Basin is a treasure bowl, the heroes are determined to extract every drop of oil. Chimneys stand like forests at the source of the Yangtze River, the great desert will be transformed into a Summer Palace. Climbing Kunlun, the heart is happy, the oil industry is developing greatly. A ton of steel and a ton of oil, that day is not far away. Oil worker brothers, add another push, and throw the hat of "oil backwardness" aside early!

    登昆仑
    李季登昆仑，放眼看，祖国山河一望间。一望山岳飘红旗，再望江河带笑颜。山河大地歌声起，花团锦绣好江山。登昆仑，看四川，黄金盆地大平原。川中川南遍油香，蜀中健儿发誓言：凿透四川万重山，峨嵋山上立标杆。登昆仑，向西看，白雪皑皑是天山。克拉玛依猛虎将，井架林立戈壁滩。南疆北疆全钻遍，红旗永远插天山。登昆仑，朝南看，热火朝天玉门关。玉门油矿老大哥，全国典型作模范。各项指标都先进，一马当先插标杆。登昆仑，往下看，柴达木红旗耀人眼。柴达木是聚宝盆，英雄们立志要把每一滴石
  油都挖干。烟囱林山长江源，大沙漠要变成颐和园。登昆仑，心喜欢，石油工业大发展。一吨钢铁一吨油，这个日子不会远。石油工人兄弟们再加一把
  劲，早早把“石油落后”的帽
  子甩一边！
