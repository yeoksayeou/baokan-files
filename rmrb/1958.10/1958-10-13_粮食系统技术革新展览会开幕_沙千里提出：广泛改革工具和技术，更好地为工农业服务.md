Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The National Grain System Technical Innovation Exhibition opened in Beijing on the 11th.

Twenty-six provinces, regions, and cities participated in the exhibition. The exhibition hall displayed over 3,000 pieces of equipment for grain storage, transportation, and processing, demonstrating the significant achievements of nearly one million grain system employees nationwide in technical innovation. For example, the simple and durable earthen and straw granaries exhibited by Jiangsu Province, the equipment-free granaries from Henan and Shanxi provinces, and the earthen mechanized granaries from Fujian Province were very popular with visitors. Among the hundreds of types of potato processing equipment and potato cellar models from various provinces, the efficiency of the equipment was generally several to dozens of times higher than manual labor, and the storage period of some potato cellars was as long as a year. In a local mechanical processing plant in Zhejiang Province, a wooden water turbine could drive seven wooden machines, including rice hullers and elevators. Many new products have also emerged in the comprehensive utilization of grains, oils, potatoes, and their by-products. There are also creations and advanced working methods in procurement and sales, basic construction, financial accounting, and other aspects.

On the 11th, at the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Sha Qianli, Minister of Food, gave a speech. He said that the task of technical innovation in the grain system is to gradually adopt new technological achievements, reform tools and equipment, and improve labor efficiency as quickly as possible, saving all possible manpower and material resources to support industrial and agricultural production.

Sha Qianli said that with the repeated leaps forward in grain production, the state and the people's communes will soon accumulate a considerable amount of reserve grain and reserve oil. Therefore, the national grain departments must not only keep the state's grain well-preserved, but also help the people's communes keep their grain well-preserved. This requires reforming grain storage tools and equipment.

Sha Qianli pointed out that the technical innovation movement in the grain sector is only the beginning, and in the future, a movement to improve tools and innovate technologies should be widely carried out according to different conditions, gradually implementing mechanical and semi-mechanical operations, and striving to change the face of various business operations within two to three years. He finally called on all employees of the grain system to learn from each other, promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and jointly study to better improve their work and better serve industrial and agricultural production.

Representatives from grain systems above the county level across the country are preparing to come to Beijing in three batches for visits and learning. Representatives from seven provinces and regions, including Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Yunnan, are already in Beijing for visits and learning.

The exhibition is scheduled to close in early November.

    粮食系统技术革新展览会开幕
    沙千里提出：广泛改革工具和技术，更好地为工农业服务
    新华社12日讯　全国粮食系统技术革新展览会11日在北京开幕。
    参加这次展览会的有二十六个省、区、市单位。展览馆展出了粮食储运和加工等机具三千多件，显示了全国近百万粮食系统职工，在技术革新方面取得的巨大成就。如江苏省展出的简易耐用的土囤仓、草囤仓；河南、山西等省的无器材粮仓；福建省的土机械化粮仓等，很受参观者的欢迎。各省的上百种薯类加工机具和薯窖模型中，机具工效一般都要比手工高出数倍至数十倍，薯窖的保藏期有的长达一年之久。浙江省的土机械加工厂里，一部木制的水轮机，能带动砻谷机、升运机等七部木制机器。在粮、油、薯类及其副产品的综合利用方面也出现了不少新产品。还有在购销、基本建设、财务会计等方面的创造和先进的工作方法。
    11日，在展览会开幕典礼上，粮食部部长沙千里讲了话。他说，粮食系统进行技术革新的任务，就在于逐步采用新的技术成就，改革工具和设备，尽可能快地提高劳动效率，节约一切可能节约的人力物力，来支援工农业生产。
    沙千里说，随着粮食生产一再跃进，不久以后，国家、人民公社将要积累起相当数量的储备粮和储备油。因此，国家粮食部门不仅要把国家的粮食保管好，而且还要帮助人民公社把粮食保管好。这就必须改革储粮的工具和设备。
    沙千里指出，粮食部门的技术革新运动还只是开始，今后应根据不同的条件，广泛地开展改良工具和革新技术的运动，逐步实行机械操作和半机械操作，争取在两三年内改变各项业务工作的面貌。他最后号召粮食系统的全体职工，要互相学习，发扬敢想、敢说、敢作的共产主义风格，共同研究，以便更好地改进工作，更好地为工农业生产服务。
    全国县以上粮食系统的代表准备分三批来京参观学习。湖南、福建、广东、广西、浙江、江西、云南等七个省、区的代表已在北京进行参观学习。
    展览会预定在11月上旬闭幕。
