    Shenyang Fan Factory Breaks Superstition and Innovates Design
    Two Thousand Blowers Completed Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Chen Ji reports: Employees of the Shenyang Fan Factory are working with soaring enthusiasm, overcoming various difficulties, and completed the task of producing two thousand blowers ahead of schedule on October 8th.

    In June, the First Ministry of Machine Building requested the Shenyang Fan Factory to produce two thousand blowers within this year. At that time, many people in the factory lacked confidence in completing this task. This was because they were to produce Roots blowers. This type of blower has a complex structure and many parts. Manufacturing a Roots blower requires at least eight hundred man-hours. The Shenyang Fan Factory had never produced this type of blower before and lacked technical experience. At the same time, the factory had insufficient equipment, a shortage of labor, and tight schedules for other products; according to the factory's current production capacity, it would take three years to produce two thousand blowers.

    The factory's Party committee, considering the urgent need for blowers for small blast furnaces and small converters in various regions, did not back down in the face of difficulties. The Party committee boldly proposed a measure: immediately research a simplified, small-flow blower to replace the Roots blower. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the researchers broke down superstitions, overcame the difficulty of lacking information, and worked day and night on research. They made five models in a row, tested them fifteen times, and finally succeeded in their research.

    This small-flow blower has a simple structure and few parts. It consumes three-quarters less raw materials than the Roots blower. However, its performance and effectiveness are exactly the same as the Roots blower. The successful research of this small-flow blower created favorable conditions for the factory to accelerate the production of two thousand blowers.

    At the end of August, according to the spirit of the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, the First Ministry of Machine Building requested the Shenyang Fan Factory to produce two thousand blowers before the end of October. The Shenyang Fan Factory immediately held a meeting to mobilize all employees to fight for the early production of two thousand blowers. The Party secretary, factory director, workshop directors, and branch secretaries moved into the factory with their luggage. Staff members of various departments also went down to the workshops, going to wherever the production tasks were tightest to work. All workers launched competitions, breaking work quotas again and again. 73% of the workers improved or innovated technologies, and production efficiency generally increased by one to six times. Originally, it took more than two hundred man-hours to manufacture a small-flow blower, but it was later generally shortened to eighty man-hours.

    In the process of manufacturing blowers, the Shenyang Fan Factory received strong support from relevant central departments and the provincial and municipal Party committees. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry sent an assistant minister to stay in Anshan Iron and Steel, specifically to urge the supply of steel for the Shenyang Fan Factory. When the Shenyang Fan Factory lacked equipment and labor, Jiao Ruoyu, the First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee, and the secretaries of the Secretariat personally convened meetings, mobilizing more than one hundred thousand factories throughout the city to help the fan factory manufacture blower housings, screws, and other parts and components. The Shenyang General Machinery Factory, the Shenyang Foundry, and others suspended the production of other products to complete the collaborative tasks of the Shenyang Fan Factory as soon as possible.

### 沈阳扇风机厂破除迷信革新设计  两千台鼓风机提前制成

    沈阳扇风机厂破除迷信革新设计
    两千台鼓风机提前制成
    本报讯　记者陈迹报道：沈阳扇风机厂职工干劲冲天，克服各种困难，在10月8日提前完成了生产两千台鼓风机的任务。
    6月间，第一机械工业部要求沈阳扇风机厂在今年内生产两千台鼓风机。当时厂内许多人对完成这一任务缺乏信心。因为当时要生产的是罗茨氏鼓风机。这种鼓风机结构复杂，部件繁多。制造一台罗茨氏鼓风机，至少需要八百多个工时。沈阳扇风机厂从来没有生产过这种鼓风机，在技术上缺少经验。同时，厂内设备不足，劳动力缺乏，别的产品任务也很紧；按照当时全厂的生产能力计算，要制成两千台鼓风机，需要三年时间。
    工厂党委会根据各地小高炉、小转炉对鼓风机的迫切需要，在困难面前没有退缩。党委会当时大胆地提出了一项措施：立刻研究出一种简易的小流量鼓风机，代替罗茨氏鼓风机。在党委领导下，研究人员破除迷信，克服缺乏资料的困难，日夜苦战，进行研究。他们一连做了五个模型，试验十五次，终于研究成功。
    这种小流量鼓风机结构简单，部件很少。消耗的原材料比罗茨氏鼓风机少四分之三。它的性能和效用，却同罗茨氏鼓风机完全一样。这种小流量鼓风机的研究成功，为全厂加速制成两千台鼓风机创造了有利条件。
    8月底，第一机械工业部根据党中央政治局扩大会议的精神，要求沈阳扇风机厂提前在10月底制成两千台鼓风机。沈阳扇风机厂马上召开会议，发动全体职工为提早制成两千台鼓风机而斗争。党委书记、厂长、车间主任和支部书记，都带着行李卷搬进工厂居住。各科室工作人员也下到车间，哪里生产任务紧张，就到哪里劳动。全体工人展开竞赛，一次再一次地突破工作定额，全厂73％的工人都改进或革新了技术，生产效率普遍提高一倍到六倍。原计划制造一台小流量鼓风机，需要二百多个工时，后来普遍缩短到八十个工时。
    沈阳扇风机厂在制造鼓风机的过程中，得到中央有关部门和省、市委的大力支持。冶金工业部曾派出一位部长助理，守在鞍钢，专门替沈阳扇风机厂催要钢材。沈阳扇风机厂设备、劳动力不足，中共沈阳市委第一书记焦若愚和书记处书记们便亲自召集会议，发动全市十万多个工厂帮助扇风机厂制造鼓风机的风壳、螺丝等零件、部件。沈阳通用机械厂、沈阳铸造厂等都曾经停下其他产品的生产，尽早完成沈阳扇风机厂的协作任务。
