Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 15th: The Executive Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting here today, passed a resolution calling on all people of goodwill throughout the world to take action, conduct propaganda, and mobilize all public opinion to stop the United States from interfering in China's internal affairs, cease its armed provocations against China, and demand that the United States withdraw all its armed forces from the Taiwan area. The resolution stated that as a result of the United States' illegal occupation of Taiwan and its intensified interference in China's internal affairs, there is a serious danger of a world war breaking out there.

The resolution emphasized that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, Mazu, and other Chinese coastal islands are indisputably an indivisible part of Chinese territory. The Chinese people have every right to exercise sovereignty over their own territory and to solve their own affairs. No foreign country should interfere. However, for several years, the United States government has been disregarding this right. It has been taking aggressive actions against China, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been spurned by the Chinese people. Recently, the United States government has also assembled an unprecedentedly large naval and air force. It has repeatedly taken provocative actions, even threatening to use atomic weapons.

The resolution pointed out that it is intolerable to endanger the lives of millions of people in order to implement such a dangerous policy. The resolution concluded by pointing out that as long as Taiwan remains under foreign control, regardless of its form or pretext, world peace will be jeopardized.

    世界和平理事会通过呼吁书
    美国武装力量从台湾地区撤出去
    新华社布拉格15日电　世界和平理事会执行委员会今天在这里举行的会议上通过了一项呼吁书，号召全世界一切善良的人们行动起来，进行宣传并动员一切舆论，阻止美国对中国内政的干涉，停止它对中国的武装挑衅，要求美国撤出它在台湾地区的一切武装部队。呼吁书说，由于美国非法占领台湾并加紧干涉中国内政的结果，那里存在着爆发世界大战的严重的危险。
    呼吁书强调指出，台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖以及其他的中国沿海岛屿无可争辩地是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。中国人民有一切权利在他们自己的领土上行使主权并且自己来解决自己的事情。任何外国都不得干涉。但是，几年来美国政府一直蔑视这种权利。它一直对中国采取侵略行动，支持为中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石集团。最近，美国政府还集结了空前庞大的海、空军力量。它一再采取挑衅性的行动，甚至以使用原子武器相威胁。
    呼吁书指出，为了执行这样一个危险的政策而把千百万人的生命置于危险的境地是不能容忍的。呼吁书最后指出，只要台湾还处在外国控制之下，不管其形式和借口如何，世界和平都将受到危害。
