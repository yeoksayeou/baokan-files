Xinhua News Agency Report: The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly concluded on the 7th. At the meetings on the 6th and 7th, many representatives in their speeches condemned the US and UK's attitude of delaying troop withdrawal from the Middle East, demanding the implementation of the UN General Assembly emergency session resolution, so that US and British troops immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. At the morning session on the 6th, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahjoub said that in order to stabilize peace and ease the tense situation in the Near and Middle East, US and British troops must immediately withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. This withdrawal should be without any conditions.

At the afternoon session on the 6th, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov spoke on the UN Secretary-General's report on the implementation of the Near East resolution of the UN General Assembly emergency session. Lukanov pointed out that the world public hopes for the swift and unconditional implementation of this resolution. But these hopes have not been realized, and US troops continue to occupy Lebanon, and British troops continue to occupy Jordan.

The Bulgarian representative said that the only correct demand of the United Nations now can only be that US and British troops withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan as soon as possible on a definite date.

At the meeting on the 7th, Czechoslovak representative David spoke on the UN Secretary-General's report on the implementation of the resolutions of the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly. He pointed out that the threat to peace and the security of Arab countries caused by the US and British aggression against Lebanon and Jordan has not yet been eliminated.

David emphasized that the United States and Britain have repeatedly put forward various conditions to delay the withdrawal of troops from Lebanon and Jordan. David said that the Czechoslovak delegation fully supports the demands that have been made in the General Assembly, namely, to require the US and British governments to determine the fastest and final deadline for the unconditional withdrawal of their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.

Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, Fawzi, pointed out in his speech that the UN Secretary-General's report was unsatisfactory, and the report did not even mention when all foreign troops would withdraw from Lebanon and Jordan. He said that the whole world is deeply disturbed by the continued stationing of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan, and demands that they withdraw as soon as possible.

Another speaker at the meeting on the 7th was Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamal, who pointed out that the presence of US and British troops in Lebanon and Jordan caused "disturbing tension."

Jamal said, "Any delay in the withdrawal of these troops from Lebanon and Jordan is a dangerous delay in the implementation of the resolution unanimously adopted (by the emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly) on August 21."

Also speaking at the meeting on the 7th was Yemeni representative Rahim. He condemned the US and British conspiracy to delay the withdrawal of their invading forces from the Middle East, France's colonial war in Algeria, and British aggression against Yemen and other countries in the southern Arabian Peninsula.

    许多国家代表在联大谴责美英耍赖
    要求两国立即从黎巴嫩约旦撤军
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：联合国大会一般性辩论已于7日结束。在6日和7日会议上，许多代表在发言中都谴责美英拖延从中东撤军的态度，要求执行联大紧急会议的决议，使美英军队立即无条件地从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。在6日上午会议上，苏丹外交部长马哈古卜说，为了稳定和平和缓和中近东的紧张局势，美英军队必须立即撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。这种撤退应当不带有任何条件。
    在6日下午会议上，保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫就联合国秘书长关于联大紧急会议的近东决议执行情况的报告发言。卢卡诺夫指出，世界公众希望迅速无条件地执行这个决议。但是这些希望没有实现，美国军队继续占领着黎巴嫩，英军继续占领着约旦。
    保加利亚代表说，现在联合国唯一正确的要求，只能是美英军队尽快在确定的日期从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退。
    在7日会议上，捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维就联合国秘书长关于联合国大会紧急特别会议的决议执行情况的报告作了发言。他指出由于美英两国侵略黎巴嫩和约旦而造成的对和平和阿拉伯国家安全的威胁，至今并未消除。
    戴维强调指出，美英两国一再提出种种条件，拖延从黎巴嫩和约旦撤出军队。戴维说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团完全支持大会上已经提出来的要求，即要求美英两国政府确定无条件地从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退它们军队的最快的、最后的期限。
    阿拉伯联合共和国外交部长法齐在发言中指出，联合国秘书长的报告是不能令人满意的，报告中甚至没有提到外国军队何时全部撤出黎巴嫩和约旦。他说，全世界对于美英两国军队继续驻扎在黎巴嫩和约旦一事深感不安，并且要求它们尽速撤退。
    在7日会议上另一个发言人是伊拉克外交部长贾迈尔，他指出，美英两国军队留在黎巴嫩和约旦引起了“令人不安的紧张局势”。
    贾迈尔说，“这些军队从黎巴嫩和约旦撤退稍有拖延，都是危险地拖延（联合国大会紧急特别会议）8月21日一致通过的决议的执行”。
    7日会议上发言的还有也门代表拉希姆。他谴责了美英两国拖延从中东撤退它们的侵略军队的阴谋，法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争，以及英国对也门和阿拉伯半岛南部其他国家进行的侵略。
