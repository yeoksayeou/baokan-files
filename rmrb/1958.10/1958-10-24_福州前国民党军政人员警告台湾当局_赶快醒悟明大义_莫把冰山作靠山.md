Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: More than forty former Kuomintang military and political personnel, relatives of Chiang's soldiers, and Taiwanese compatriots living in Fuzhou held a discussion meeting on the 22nd, unanimously supporting Minister Peng Dehuai's order to resume the shelling of Jinmen. At the meeting, they warned the Taiwan authorities to abandon their stubborn attitude in the spirit of national righteousness, break away from the enslavement of the American aggressors, and join the people of the motherland in opposing the American aggressors.

Li Shijia, former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Navy, Commander of the Mawei Fortress, and member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: Our Ministry of National Defense has twice ordered our troops on the Fujian front to cease shelling Jinmen, but the Taiwan authorities have stubbornly refused to accept peace talks, stepped up war preparations, loudly clamored for "counter-attacking" the mainland, and introduced American warships for escort, violating the conditions put forward by our Ministry of National Defense for suspending the shelling of Jinmen. This is intolerable. He warned the Chiang's troops in Taiwan: Don't be mistaken. Our cessation of shelling stems from a sincere desire to safeguard national righteousness and world peace. You cannot rely on the iceberg of American imperialism; one day, they will kick you away. Li Shijia reminded his naval colleagues in Taiwan: You are like a lonely boat lost in the turbulent ocean, destined to drift aimlessly without a shore to rely on. You should wake up quickly, recognize the general trend, and return to the embrace of the motherland.

Hou Zhaohai, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's Fujian Provincial Branch, said: Minister Peng Dehuai's two orders to suspend the shelling of Jinmen and the proposal for a peaceful resolution of internal conflicts have given Taiwanese compatriots boundless hope. Now, the Taiwan authorities have introduced American warships for escort during our suspension of shelling Jinmen and invited Dulles to Taiwan to further plot war conspiracies, which the Taiwanese compatriots resolutely oppose. The people of Taiwan have a rich tradition of anti-aggression and anti-oppression, and they will surely join the people of the motherland in crushing the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and drive out the American robbers.

    福州前国民党军政人员警告台湾当局
    赶快醒悟明大义
    莫把冰山作靠山
    新华社23日讯　住在福州市的前国民党军政人员、蒋军家属和台湾同胞四十多人在22日举行座谈会，一致拥护我彭德怀部长关于恢复炮击金门的命令，他们在会上警告台湾当局应本着民族大义的精神，放弃顽固态度，摆脱美国侵略者的奴役和祖国人民一起共同反对美国侵略者。
    前国民党海军次长、马尾要塞司令、政协福建省委员会委员李世甲说：我国防部两次命令福建前线我军停止炮击金门，台湾当局却坚持顽固态度，拒不接受和谈，加紧战争准备，高叫“反攻”大陆，引进美国军舰护航，违反我国防部提出的暂停炮击金门的条件，这是不可容忍的。他警告台湾蒋军说：你们不要弄错，我们停止炮击是从维护民族大义、世界和平的善良愿望出发的。你们依靠美帝国主义这座冰山是靠不住的，它们总有一天会把你们一脚踢开。李世甲提醒在台湾的他的海军同事说：你们好比在波涛汹涌的海洋里迷失方向的一只孤船，只能作无靠岸的漂泊，你们应赶快醒悟过来，认清大势，回到祖国怀抱。
    台盟福建省支部筹委会副主任委员侯兆海说：彭德怀部长两次命令暂停炮击金门，建议和平解决内争问题，台湾同胞对此怀着无限希望，现在台湾当局竟在我停止炮击金门期间引进美舰护航，并把杜勒斯请到台湾进一步策划战争阴谋，这是台湾同胞所坚决反对的。台湾人民是富有反侵略反压迫传统的，他们定会和祖国人民一起，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，赶走美国强盗。
