Combined report from our newspaper: U.S. monopoly capital organizations are intensifying their plunder of Latin American oil, which has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction in Latin American countries.

According to Venezuela's "El Nacional," former Venezuelan President and Chairman of the Democratic Action Party, Rómulo Betancourt, stated in a speech to business people in Maracaibo that Venezuela should pursue a new policy in oil, breaking away from the control of U.S. monopoly organizations. Betancourt's proposition reflected the voices of Venezuelan political figures demanding an independent and autonomous oil policy. Jovito Villalba, leader of the Democratic Republican Union of Venezuela, stated not long ago that Venezuela's oil industry "must be established quickly." Venezuela's oil production ranks second in the capitalist world, and 60% of the national treasury's income depends on the oil industry. However, because 90% of Venezuela's oil extraction industry is controlled by U.S. oil companies, Venezuela's current economy is in a state of suffocation.

According to Paris's "Le Monde," the Argentine government is planning to develop its own oil resources in order to implement a self-sufficient oil policy. Not long ago, an article on Argentina's oil policy, released by the Secretariat of the Argentine President's Office, emphasized that Argentina has oil reserves underground, but it currently has to spend more than 300 million U.S. dollars to purchase the oil it needs from foreign countries. He said that the Argentine government is unwilling to rely on foreign countries for oil any longer, because "relying on foreign oil means the gradual impoverishment of Argentina, and in the event of a world economic crisis, Argentina's sovereignty and independence will be threatened."

A recently published booklet by Pedraza in Bolivia, "Bolivia's Mineral Problems," pointed out the U.S.'s intensified plunder of Bolivia's oil wealth. The author said that foreign companies, mainly U.S. companies, have obtained oil exploration rights for an area of 11.32 million hectares in recent years. U.S. imperialism has never treated Bolivia as a sovereign country. The U.S.'s increasingly greedy annexation of Bolivia's natural wealth and the undermining and destruction of Bolivia's economic development forces Bolivians to realize that Bolivia's industrialization cannot come from the West, but only from the socialist East.

Brazil's "Voz Operária" argued in an article entitled "Foreign Trade and Oil" for changing Brazil's foreign trade policy, which is subordinate to the interests of U.S. monopoly capital.

The newspaper wrote that Brazil has suffered very serious damage because Brazil's foreign trade is almost absolutely under the control of the U.S. market. The article said that our major export products such as coffee, cocoa, and cotton mainly rely on the U.S. market, so the U.S. manipulates the prices of these products and arbitrarily lowers prices for its own benefit, thereby bringing us to the brink of difficult childbirth.

### 华尔街老板在“后院”加紧掠夺石油  拉丁美洲公众主张摆脱美国控制

    华尔街老板在“后院”加紧掠夺石油
    拉丁美洲公众主张摆脱美国控制
    本报综合报道　美国垄断资本组织加紧掠夺拉丁美洲石油，已经引起拉丁美洲各国日益强烈的不满。
    据委内瑞拉“民族报”报道，委内瑞拉前总统、民主行动党主席贝坦科尔特在马拉开波城对实业界人士讲话时主张委内瑞拉在石油方面奉行脱离美国垄断组织控制的新政策。贝坦科尔特的主张反映了委内瑞拉政界人士中要求在石油方面执行独立自主政策的呼声。委内瑞拉民主共和联盟领袖霍维托·维利亚尔布不久以前就曾经表示，“必须迅速建立”委内瑞拉的石油工业。委内瑞拉的石油生产占资本主义世界第二位，国库收入的60％依靠石油工业。但是，由于委内瑞拉的石油开采工业的90％都控制在美国石油公司手里，委内瑞拉目前的经济处在一种窒息状态中。
    又据巴黎“新闻报”报道，阿根廷政府正在打算开发自己的石油资源以便实行自给自足的石油政策。不久以前，阿根廷总统府秘书处发布的弗朗迪西总统谈阿根廷石油政策的一篇文章中强调指出，阿根廷地下蕴藏着石油，然而它目前却要花三亿多美元向外国购买它自己所需的石油。他说，阿根廷政府不愿意在石油方面再依赖外国了，因为“依靠外来的石油，意味着阿根廷的逐渐贫困化，这样，一旦发生世界经济危机时，阿根廷的主权和独立便会受到威胁”。
    玻利维亚最近出版的佩德拉萨斯的小册子“玻利维亚的矿产问题”指出美国加紧掠夺玻利维亚石油财富的情况，作者说，外国公司，主要是美国公司最近几年中获得了面积一千一百三十二万公顷的石油开采权，美帝国主义从来没有像对待一个主权国家那样来对待过玻利维亚。美国日益贪婪地在吞并玻利维亚的自然财富，瓦解和破坏玻利维亚的经济发展，这种现实情况迫使玻利维亚人想到：玻利维亚的工业化不可能来自西方，而只能来自社会主义的东方。
    巴西“工人呼声报”在题为“对外贸易和石油”的一篇文章中主张改变巴西从属于美国垄断资本利益的对外贸易政策。
    这家报纸写道，由于巴西的对外贸易几乎绝对处于美国市场的控制之下，巴西遭到了非常严重的损害。文章说，我国大宗出口产品如咖啡、可可、棉花主要依赖美国市场，因此美国就操纵这些产品的价格，为了自己的利益而任意压价从而使我们濒于难产。
