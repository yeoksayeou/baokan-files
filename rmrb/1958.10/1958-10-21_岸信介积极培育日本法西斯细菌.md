    Kishi Nobusuke Actively Cultivates Japanese Fascist Bacteria
    Lan Hai
    Encouraged by the Kishi Nobusuke government's revival of militarist policies, the activities of fascist organizations throughout Japan are becoming increasingly rampant. Japanese fascist groups, once dissolved after the war, have re-emerged under various guises in recent years, thanks to the support or tacit approval of Kishi Nobusuke. Currently, there are over 600 such fascist organizations in Japan. They loudly proclaim slogans such as "revise the Constitution," "rearm," "revive the Emperor system," and "oppose the Soviet Union and communism," paving the way for the Kishi Nobusuke government to revive militarism.

    Old Soldiers—The Core of Fascist Organizations
    The resurgence of Japanese fascist organizations coincides with the pace of Japan's rearmament. The core of these fascist organizations consists of former Japanese soldiers with blood on their hands from the people of Asian countries, many of whom are heinous Japanese war criminals.
    After the signing of the San Francisco "Treaty of Peace with Japan," a group of former Japanese soldiers used the banner of "Old Soldiers' Friendship and Mutual Aid" to openly carry out activities for Japan's rearmament. Former army elements re-established the "Kougyoukai" (偕行会), with former Army General Imamura Hitoshi as chairman, and former navy elements re-established the "Suikoukai" (水交社), with former Navy Admiral Yamanashi Katsunoshin as chairman. Following Takakura Toshiyuki, fascist soldiers such as Nomura Kichisaburo, Ugaki Kazushige, Matsumura Shuichi, and Hoshina Zenshiro successively entered the Diet. Okamura Yasuji, the former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army to China, whose hands were stained with the blood of the Chinese people, gathered his former subordinates and restored the old "Veterans Association" under the name of "Hometown Friends Association" throughout Japan. In 1954, a "Sakuraboshi (Cherry Star) Club" was established in Tokyo by veterans of the army and navy. In June 1955, veterans organizations from all over the country merged to form the "Veterans Groups Federation," with 850,000 members. In November 1956, this organization further developed into the current "Japan Veterans League," with former Kwantung Army Commander Ueda Kenkichi as chairman and Okamura Yasuji as vice chairman and director. In 1957, Okamura Yasuji became chairman. This organization also recruited important war criminals such as former Combined Fleet Commander Ozawa Jisaburo, former Military Police Commander Shibayama Shigeichi, former Army Minister Shimomura Sada, and Kaya Okinori, the Minister of Finance in the Tojo cabinet. Yazaki Kazuo, who served as the Director-General of the Defense Agency in the Kishi Nobusuke government and Kishi Nobusuke's personal envoy, responsible for liaison with Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, served as an advisor to this organization. Okamura Yasuji styled himself as an "unofficial Minister of Defense," taking planes and cars provided by the Self-Defense Forces to "inspect" "veterans" and the Self-Defense Forces throughout the country. As soon as some war criminals such as Imamura Hitoshi and Takakura Toshiyuki walked out of the war criminal detention center, they ran to Araki Sadao, known as the "God of War," to discuss "urgent national defense matters." In March of this year, Okamura Yasuji at the third plenary session of the "Veterans League" clamored to expand the organization with the goal of eight million members, to sort out the membership list, so that in the event of an emergency, they could be immediately summoned, activate civil defense organizations, implement mobilization training, and strive to prevent red ideology. According to the 1958 activity plan, this fascist group planned to add youth and women's sections to pull Japanese youth and women onto the path of fascism. At the same time, it also planned to establish branches according to professional scope, penetrating into government agencies and industrial and mining enterprises for activities.

    Calling Back Souls for Militarism
    These fascist groups, under the guise of popularizing "national defense thought" and "commemorating the heroic spirits," openly promote and disseminate militarist ideology. They strive to undermine the people's struggle for democracy and Japan's labor movement. The Fukui Prefecture "Veterans Association," with 5,000 members, held eight "current affairs lectures," seventeen "current affairs film screenings," two visits to warships, four visits to the Self-Defense Forces, and held five military band concerts and five "memorial services for fallen heroes" in the past year. For its contribution to promoting militarist ideology and assisting the development of the Self-Defense Forces, the First District Superintendent of the Ground Self-Defense Force issued them a letter of thanks in March of this year.
    Since liaison offices of the Self-Defense Forces were established in all prefectures throughout the country in 1956, the connection between the "Veterans Associations" and the Self-Defense Forces has become increasingly close. They assist the Self-Defense Forces in recruiting new members, conduct pre-entry training for young people, hold grand "welcome parties for entry," and organize gatherings and fencing competitions with the Self-Defense Forces, among other activities. The "Veterans Associations" in various cities, towns, and villages also erect "Loyalty Towers" for those who died in the aggressive war and hold "memorial services." On August 15th, the anniversary of the end of the war this year, more than 30 fascist groups, led by the "Veterans League," held a "Memorial Service for War Dead of the Greater East Asia War" at the former military veterans' hall. They shouted loudly to make August 15th a "National March Day" of "unforgettable pain," inciting militarist revenge thinking.

    Among these fascist organizations, two called "Civil Defense" and "Hoyukai (Preservation Association)" have a more direct connection with the reactionary armed forces established by the Kishi Nobusuke government. The "Civil Defense" organization, claiming to have 9,000 members, is a reactionary civil defense group, publicly propagating anti-communism and anti-people on weekdays and engaging in military training such as bayonet practice. The leader of the "Hoyukai" is Kimura Tokutaro, the former Director-General of the National Police Agency, nicknamed "Syngman Rhee," and its members are retired soldiers of the Self-Defense Forces. In December 1957, Kimura also organized an organization called "Kigensetsu (Empire Day) Celebration Association," and on February 11th of this year, the legendary day of Emperor Jinmu's enthronement, held Kigensetsu celebration ceremonies in thirty prefectures throughout the country. The revival of Kigensetsu is a symbol of the revival of Japanese militarism. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had long wanted to designate it as a statutory holiday, but it failed due to public opposition. The "Kigensetsu Celebration Association" organized by Kimura is, in fact, realizing Kishi Nobusuke's wish.

    Serving American Intelligence Agencies
    Among the Japanese fascist groups, many are lackeys of American intelligence agencies. They gather a group of local thugs to act as henchmen for the Kishi Nobusuke government, harming innocent people and committing all kinds of evil. Asanuma Michio, the editor of "Bokyo (Anti-Communist) News," who gave a "Support Chiang and Oppose Communism" speech and burned the Chinese flag in front of Shinbashi Station in Tokyo on October 10th, and Akao Bin, the head of the "Greater Japan Patriotic Party," are tools bought by American intelligence agencies. "Bokyo News" is a reactionary newspaper subsidized by the United States. In order to promote fascist ideology, it is given away for free and openly advocates for atomic warfare. A fascist organization in Osaka called the "Greater Japan Production Party," under the banner of "Establishing an Anti-Communist Front," colludes with American intelligence agencies to engage in reactionary activities such as sabotaging the workers' movement. The "Greater Japan Patriotic Party" and other sordid fascist organizations such as the "Japan Comrades Association," "Kuomintang," "Chrysanthemum Flag Comrades Association," "National Salvation Righteous Party," "Anti-Communist Federation," and "Anti-Communist Patriotic League" are notorious for destroying offices of the Japan Teachers Union and organizing anti-Soviet activities in front of the Soviet Embassy.

    There are also a variety of fascist groups that are specially hired thugs of Japanese monopoly capitalists. For example, the "Kokoku-dan (National Protection Corps)" and "Junkoku Youth Corps" (Martyrdom Youth Corps), which own the "Kokoku Youth Squad," are a group of villains who extort good people and disrupt workers' strike activities. The "Independent Youth League," which colludes with the "Junkoku Youth Corps," specializes in disrupting the National Railway Workers' Union. The "Yamato Party" engages in sabotage activities in heavy industrial enterprises. This fascist organization, claiming to have 1,300 members, is a fascist group from the old South Manchuria Railway system. It receives activity funds from monopoly capitalists in heavy industries such as Yawata Steel Works and Fuji Steel Works and is specifically hostile to trade union organizations. Members of the "Yamato Party" have broken into enterprises such as Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Nagasaki Shipyard, Nippon Steel Muroran Works, and Nissan Motor Yoshihara Factory to disrupt and undermine the workers' movement.

    The Pillar of Kishi Nobusuke
    The Kishi Nobusuke government deliberately protects and keeps these fascist groups, intending to use them as pillars to realize its imperialist aggressive ambitions. The pensions issued by the Kishi Nobusuke government to former soldiers have increased year by year. In the 1958 budget of the Kishi Nobusuke government, these pensions have increased to 85.3 billion yen. The Kishi Nobusuke government also takes various ways to encourage and use these fascist organizations. When more than 30 fascist groups held a "Memorial Service for War Dead of the Greater East Asia War" on August 15th, Kishi Nobusuke and his ministers all presented flowers, desperately cheering them on. Another fascist organization called the "Japan Kenseikai (Healthy Youth Association)," with the support of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, openly sent representatives to attempt to participate in the Asian Student Conference and organize the "Asian Student Association," engaging in espionage activities to undermine the unity of Asian students.

    Although the Kishi Nobusuke government has tried its best to support the activities of fascist groups, today's Japan is no longer the Japan of before the war. Before the war, the backers of fascist groups were Japanese militarists, and their development targets were mainly rural youth. After the war, the militarists disintegrated, the democratic consciousness of the peasants increased, and the base of fascist groups' activities has greatly shrunk. More importantly, today the struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people for national independence, democracy, and peace is becoming increasingly strengthened. The main people the fascist groups can recruit are some reactionary social dregs. A part of the deceived backward masses will also soon wake up. The Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to use such a group of scoundrels to help it promote the aggressive policy of reviving imperialism and militarism will only further expose its imperialist ambitions, thereby further arousing the opposition of the Japanese people and the people of Asian countries to it. This practice of cultivating fascist forces by the Kishi Nobusuke government is very dangerous for it. The more rampant the activities of Japanese fascist organizations, the closer the Kishi Nobusuke government colludes with fascist organizations, the more isolated the Kishi Nobusuke government becomes among the Japanese people and among Asian countries. In the end, it will surely lift a stone to drop it on its own feet.

    岸信介积极培育日本法西斯细菌
    蓝海
    在岸信介政府复活军国主义政策的鼓励下，日本各地法西斯组织的活动，越来越嚣张了。战后一度被解散的日本法西斯团体，由于近年来得到岸信介的支持或默许，已用各种各样的名义重新抬头。目前，这类法西斯组织在日本已达六百多个。它们高叫“修改宪法”、
  “重新武装”、“复活天皇制”和“反苏反共”等口号，为岸信介政府复活军国主义鸣锣开道。
    旧军人——法西斯组织的核心
    日本法西斯组织的死灰复燃，是同日本的重新武装的步调相一致的。这些法西斯组织的核心，是双手沾满了亚洲各国人民血迹的日本旧军人，其中许多人是罪大恶极的日本战争罪犯。
    旧金山“对日和约”签订后，一批日本的旧军人就打出“旧军人亲睦互助”的招牌，公然为日本的重新武装积极进行活动。旧陆军分子重新建立了以前陆军大将今村均为会长的“偕行会”，旧海军分子重新建立了以前海军大将山梨胜之为会长的“水交社”。继?政信之后，野村吉三郎、宇垣一成、松村秀逸、保科善四郎等法西斯军人，都先后进入了国会。双手沾满中国人民鲜血的前日本中国派遣军总司令冈村宁次，纠集旧部下在日本全国各地以“乡友会”的名目，恢复了旧日的“在乡军人会”。1954年在东京出现了一个海陆军人合办的“樱星俱乐部”。1955年6月全国各地的旧军人组织合并组成“战友团体联合会”，拥有会员八十五万人。1956年11月这个组织又发展成为现在的“日本乡友联盟”，由原关东军司令植田谦吉担任会长，冈村宁次担任副会长兼理事长。1957年，冈村宁次改任会长。这个组织还网罗了前联合舰队司令小泽治三郎、前宪兵司令柴山重一、前陆军大臣下村定、东条内阁的藏相贺屋兴宜等重要战犯。担任岸信介政府防卫厅长官和岸信介本人的特使，负责同李承晚、蒋介石进行联系工作的矢次一夫等人，担任了这个组织的顾问。冈村宁次以在野的“国防长官”自居，乘着自卫队提供的飞机和汽车，到全国各地“检阅”“在乡军人”和自卫队。今村均、?政信等一些战犯，刚一走出战犯收容所，就跑去同号称“军神”的荒木贞夫商谈“国防的急务”。今年3月冈村宁次在“乡友联盟”第三次全会上扬言要以八百万会员为目标来扩充组织，整理会员名单，作到一旦有事，立即可以召集起来，活跃民防组织，实行动员训练，为防止赤化思想而奋斗。”从1958年度的活动计划来看，这个法西斯团体准备增设青少年部和妇女部，要把日本青少年和妇女拉上法西斯的道路。同时，还准备按职业范围设立分会，打进机关和工矿企业内部进行活动。
    替军国主义招魂
    这些法西斯团体，以普及“国防思想”、“悼念英灵”等为名，公开鼓吹和传播军国主义思想。它们力图破坏人民争取民主的斗争和日本的劳工运动。拥有五千名会员的福井县“乡友会”，在去年一年内举行了八次“时局讲演会”，十七次“时局电影会”，两次到军舰参观，四次到自卫队参观，还举行了五次军乐队演奏会，五次“阵亡烈士慰灵祭”。因为宣传军国主义思想和协助发展自卫队有功，今年3月陆上自卫队第一管区总监发给他们一份感谢书。
    自从1956年全国各都道府县设立自卫队的连络部以来，各地“乡友会”同自卫队的联系日益密切起来。它们协助自卫队招募新队员，对青年实行入队前的预备训练，大开“入队欢迎会”，同自卫队举行联欢会和劈刺比赛等活动，不一而足。各市町村的“乡友会”，还为在侵略战争中的战死者大立“忠灵塔”，举行“慰灵祭”。今年8月15日战争结束纪念日，以“乡友联盟”为首的三十多个法西斯团体，在旧军人会馆举行了“大东亚战争殉国者慰灵祭”。它们大喊大叫地要把8月15日作为“不能忘记痛痕”的“民族大行进日”，煽动军国主义复仇思想。
    这些法西斯组织中，有两个叫“民防”组织和“保友会”的，同岸信介政府建立的反动武装，更有着直接的联系。“民防”组织，号称有会员九千人，是一种反动的民团性质，平时公开宣扬反共反人民，并从事劈刺等军事训练。“保友会”的头子是绰号叫做“李承晚”的前保安厅长官木村笃太郎，会员为自卫队的退伍军人。木村还在1957年12月组织了一个“纪元节庆祝会”的组织，在今年2月11日，即传说中的神武天皇即位日，于全国三十个都府县举行了纪元节庆祝典礼。纪元节的复活是日本军国主义复活的象征，执政的自由民主党早就要把它制定为法定节日，但由于人民的反对而未能得逞。木村组织的这个“纪元节庆祝会”，事实上是实现岸信介的愿望。
    为美国特务机关效劳
    在日本法西斯团体中，有许多团体是美国特务机关的走狗。它们纠合一群地痞流氓，为岸信介政府充当打手，残害善良人民，无恶不作。今年10月10日在东京新桥车站前发表“援蒋反共”演说，并烧毁中国国旗的“防共新闻”主编浅沼美知雄和“大日本爱国党”的头目赤尾敏，就是美国特务机关收买的一个工具。“防共新闻”是受美国津贴的反动报纸，为了宣传法西斯主义思想，竟然免费赠送，并且公开叫嚣赞成原子战争。大阪有一个叫做“大日本生产党”的法西斯组织，打着“树立反共战线”的旗号，同美国特务机关勾结在一起，从事破坏工人运动等反动活动。“大日本爱国党”和“日本同志会”、“国民党”、“菊旗同志会”、“救国立正党”、“反共联合会”、“防共爱国联盟”等这些乌七八糟的法西斯组织，以捣毁日本教职员工会办事处和在苏联大使馆门前组织反苏活动而臭名昭著。
    还有一些名目繁多的法西斯团体，是日本垄断资本家专门雇佣的打手。比如，拥有“护国青年队”的“护国团”和“殉国青年队”，就是敲诈良民和破坏工人罢工活动的一群恶棍。而专门破坏国营铁道工会组织的，有同“殉国青年队”勾结在一起的“独立青年同盟”。在重工业企业中从事破坏勾当的，则有“大和党”。这个号称一千三百名党员的法西斯组织，是旧南满铁路系统的法西斯团体，它从八幡制铁所、富士制铁所等重工业的垄断资本家领取活动经费，专门与工会组织为敌。“大和党”的党徒们，曾经闯入三菱造船公司长崎造船所、日本制钢所室兰工厂、日产汽车公司吉原工厂等企业捣乱，破坏工人运动。
    岸信介的支柱
    岸信介政府加意庇护和豢养这些法西斯团体，是要把它们作为自己实现帝国主义侵略野心的支柱。岸信介政府发放给旧军人的年金，逐年都有增加。1958年度，在岸信介政府的预算中，这种年金已增加到八百五十三亿日元。岸信介政府还采取各种方式来鼓励和利用这些法西斯组织。今年8月15日，三十多个法西斯团体举行“大东亚战争殉国者慰灵祭”时，岸信介和各大臣均赠献鲜花，拼命给他们打气。还有一个叫“日本健青会”的法西斯组织，在日本外务省的支持下，公然派遣代表企图参加亚洲学生会议及组织“亚洲学生协会”，从事特务活动，以破坏亚洲学生的团结。
    尽管岸信介政府千方百计地支持法西斯团体的活动，然而今天的日本已经不是战前的日本了。战前法西斯团体的靠山是日本军阀，发展对象主要是农村青年。战后，军阀解体了，农民的民主觉悟提高了，法西斯团体活动的地盘已经大大缩小了。更重要的是今天广大日本人民争取民族独立、民主、和平的斗争越来越加强了。法西斯团体所能网罗到的主要是一些反动的社会渣滓。一部分被蒙蔽的落后群众，也很快会觉悟过来。岸信介政府极力想利用这样一群败类来帮助它推行复活帝国主义和军国主义的侵略政策，只会更加暴露出它的帝国主义野心，从而更加引起日本人民和亚洲各国人民对它的反对。岸信介政府这种培植法西斯势力的作法，对它是十分危险的。日本法西斯组织的活动越猖獗，岸信介政府同法西斯组织勾结得越密切，岸信介政府在日本人民中和亚洲各国之间也就越发孤立，到头来，它必定搬起石头砸了自己的头脚。
