Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: Officers and soldiers of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) boarded the last troop withdrawal train at 12:00 noon today, departing Pyongyang to return home. Premier of the Cabinet of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, and other party and government leaders personally went to the station to bid farewell.

At the square in front of Pyongyang Station, Commander Yang Yong, facing the 300,000 people of Pyongyang City who had come to bid farewell to the CPV, delivered a farewell speech, saying that now, the entire CPV has withdrawn from North Korea. Our actions powerfully demonstrate to the world the sincere desire of the Chinese and Korean people to safeguard peace and promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The United States military must withdraw from southern Korea. If it continues to occupy southern Korea and artificially creates a division between North and South Korea, it will only subject itself to even stronger condemnation from the people of the world and become even more isolated.

This morning, after the rain in Pyongyang, the sun shone brilliantly in the autumn sky, and the national flags of North Korea and China fluttered everywhere in the city. On the magnificent Pyongyang Station building, portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong were hung high. On both sides of the building were huge banners written in both Chinese and Korean: "The great achievements established by the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers will shine forever in the history of our country."

At 10:00 a.m., the officers and soldiers of the headquarters of the CPV lined up at Kim Il-sung Square and set off. They were neatly dressed, their military bearing was mighty, and everyone wore various medals and awards, stepping forward with vigorous strides towards the station.

CPV Commander General Yang Yong and Political Commissar General Wang Ping walked at the forefront of the procession. Accompanying them on foot to the station were Vice Chairman of the Central Committee for Welcoming and Seeing off the Chinese People's Volunteers, Li Il-kyung, Minister of National Defence General Kim Kwang-hyup, and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army.

On both sides of the approximately two-kilometer-long street where the CPV marched, crowds of enthusiastic people stood cheering. Holding flowers and colored flags, and with thousands of colored paper streamers stretched face to face, they formed the entire street into a colorful river. The colored paper scraps scattered on the CPV by the welcoming crowds were like a rain of colorful flowers. The CPV officers and soldiers walked on this road of flowers to embark on their journey home in triumph.

Along the way, many people ran out of the ranks to present flowers and gifts to the CPV. Among them were white-haired old men, children wearing red scarves, and Korean meritorious actors such as Ahn Seong-hee. They reluctantly held hands with the CPV, saying goodbye and embracing them, and they presented the CPV with newly harvested apples, chestnuts, and Korean ginseng wine. The gifts and bouquets presented by the people were so many that the CPV officers and soldiers could not hold them all.

It took the CPV procession a full hour to pass through the incredibly enthusiastic crowds and reach the square in front of the station.

In the station square, Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping, accompanied by General Kim Kwang-hyup, reviewed the guard of honor. Then, Commander Yang Yong delivered a farewell speech to the welcoming crowds. He said that every one of our commanders and fighters will cherish the brotherly friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people as if cherishing our own eyes. Although we have left Korea, our hearts will forever be with you.

The time for boarding the train arrived, and the "Chinese People's Volunteers Battle Song" was played at the station. Commander Yang Yong, Political Commissar Wang Ping, and the CPV generals warmly shook hands with Premier Kim Il-sung and other Korean state leaders to say goodbye.

At exactly 12:00 noon, the train carrying the last group of CPV officers and soldiers leaving Pyongyang slowly started moving. The CPV officers and soldiers leaned out of the train windows to shake hands with the people who came to see them off once again. At the station, the crowds shouted, "We wish you a safe journey!" and reluctantly waved goodbye as they watched the train speed north.

Today, those who came to the station to see them off included Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, Choi Yong-kun, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Chung Il-ryong, Nam Il, and Lee Joo-yeon, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Park Jung-ae, Park Kim-chul, and Kim Chang-man, ministers of the Cabinet, heads of social organizations, "Volunteer Army Mothers" Ryu Mae, support-the-front models Gu Fu-ryeok, Seok Gil-ryong, and others.

Also at the station to see them off were the Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and embassy staff, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea.

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee for Welcoming and Seeing off the Chinese People's Volunteers, Li Il-kyung, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, Lieutenant General Seo Cheol, and Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in North Korea, Cao Keqiang, accompanied the CPV officers and soldiers to Sinuiju, the border city of North Korea, on the same train today.

    鲜花成林热情欢送　人群似海依依话别
    平壤三十万人送别志愿军
    新华社平壤25日电　中国人民志愿军总部官兵今天中午十二时乘坐最后一列撤军列车离开平壤返国。朝鲜内阁首相金日成等党和政府和领导人亲自到车站欢送。
    杨勇司令员在平壤车站前广场上，面对欢送志愿军的三十万平壤市人民致告别词说，现在，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜了。我们用行动向全世界有力地说明了中朝两国人民对于维护和平、促使朝鲜问题和平解决的真诚愿望。美国军队必须从朝鲜南部撤出去。如果它继续霸占朝鲜南部，人为地制造南北朝鲜的分裂，那就只会使它受到全世界人民更加强烈的谴责而更加陷于孤立。
    今天上午，平壤雨后初晴，在灿烂的秋阳照射下，全城到处飘扬着朝中两国国旗。在宏伟的平壤车站大楼上，高悬着金日成首相和毛泽东主席的画像。大楼两旁悬挂着用中朝两国文字写的巨幅标语：“英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵们建立的伟大功勋，在我们祖国历史上永放光芒”。
    上午十时，中国人民志愿军总部官兵在金日成广场整队出发。他们服装整齐，军容威武，人人都佩戴起各种勋章、奖章，迈开雄健的步伐，前往车站。
    志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将走在队伍的最前面。陪同他们一同步行前往车站的有朝鲜欢送中国人民志愿军中央委员会副委员长李一卿、民族保卫相金光侠大将和人民军的官兵们。
    在志愿军步行经过的约二公里长的街道两旁，站满了热情欢呼的群众。他们手执鲜花和彩旗和面对面拉起的千万条彩色的纸带，把整个街道组成了一条彩色的河流。欢送群众向志愿军身上撒下的彩色纸屑，有如五彩的花雨。志愿军官兵们就踏着这条鲜花的道路走上凯旋回国的路程。
    沿路有许多群众从行列里跑出来向志愿军献花、献礼。其中有白发苍苍的老人，有系着红领巾的儿童，有朝鲜的功勋演员安圣姬等。他们依依难舍地拉着志愿军话别、拥抱，他们把今年新收下来的苹果、栗子和朝鲜的人参酒献给志愿军。群众献的礼物和花束，使志愿军官兵拿也拿不了。
    志愿军的队伍整整用了一个钟头才穿过热情无比的群众行列，到达车站前广场。
    在车站广场上，杨勇司令员、王平政治委员由金光侠大将陪同检阅了仪仗队。接着，杨勇司令员向欢送群众致告别词。他说，我们每个指战员都将如同爱护自己的眼睛一样，珍视中朝两国人民间兄弟般的友谊和团结。我们虽然离开了朝鲜，但是我们的心，却永远同你们在一起。
    登车的时间到了，车站上奏起“中国人民志愿军战歌”。杨勇司令员、王平政治委员和志愿军的将军们同金日成首相等朝鲜国家领导人热烈握手告别。
    十二时整，列车载着最后一批离开平壤的志愿军官兵徐徐开动了。志愿军官兵们从车窗里探出身来再一次同欢送的人们握手道别。车站上，群众高呼“祝你们一路平安！”并恋恋不舍地挥手目送列车奔驰北去。
    今天，来车站送行的有朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健，内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长，社会团体负责人，“志愿军妈妈”柳梅、支前模范具富力、石吉荣等。
    到车站送行的还有以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团，中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和使馆人员以及各国驻朝使节。
