    没有十月革命就没有独立的捷克斯洛伐克
    布拉格庆祝共和国成立四十周年
    据新华社布拉格28日电　布拉格市人民28日晚间举行了一个盛大的集会，庆祝捷克斯洛伐克共和国成立四十周年。
    会上的口号是：“没有伟大的十月社会主义革命，就没有独立的捷克斯洛伐克！”
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员柯别茨基在会上讲话时强调指出，1918年10月28日捷克斯洛伐克共和国的成立是捷克斯洛伐克人民革命的民族解放运动的结果，而这个运动又是受到伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利的鼓舞而开展的。
    柯别茨基接着谈到了捷克和斯洛伐克劳动人民的革命觉悟的不断高涨，阐明了资产阶级领袖在捷克斯洛伐克共和国头二十年中所起的作用的真象，并且指出了捷克斯洛伐克共产党对资产阶级和法西斯主义所进行的斗争。
    随后，柯别茨基同志还着重指出了捷克斯洛伐克共产党对于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，对于苏联和苏联共产党的一贯忠诚。
