Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 17th. Guangxi's Huanjiang County has come from behind and taken the lead. On October 15th, the first day of the high-yield steel production week, it produced 63,321.5 tons of pig iron and 51,808.5 tons of sintered iron, jumping to the top position in the country. The county's pig iron output on this day is roughly equivalent to the output of Guangxi in a century before liberation.

Huanjiang County has long been a red banner in Guangxi's iron smelting production. The pig iron produced is of good quality and is welcomed by various steelmaking units in Liuzhou City. The pig iron produced on this day was inspected by Hong Hua, the First Secretary of the CPC Huanjiang County Committee, Yu Ziming, the First Secretary of the CPC Hechi County Committee, and students from Peking University and the Geological Institute who came to participate in steel production, and it was proved to be gray cast iron and white cast iron.

Huanjiang County has a population of only 160,000. After a general mobilization and great debate on large-scale steel production, in addition to the original 60,000 fixed steel field army, another 27,000 people from the rear went to the steel front. Yishan and Hechi counties also sent a 23,000-strong field army, bringing tools, vehicles, and horses to support. Under the slogan of "the whole country, the entire autonomous region, and the entire special zone as one chessboard," they fought side by side and, after four days and nights of hard work, stored 237,000 tons of coal and other fuels, and more than 220,000 tons of ore. In five places rich in raw materials and fuels, they built 21,837 new large, medium, and small iron smelting kilns, plus the original small indigenous blast furnaces, totaling 22,091 iron smelting furnaces and kilns, making full preparations for high yields.

During the period of great "satellite" launching, party secretaries at all levels in the county went deep into the furnaces and construction sites, participating in production and conducting political and ideological work. Propaganda and mobilization work and comparisons and competitions were carried out on all construction sites.

    一个县一天等于全自治区一百年
    环江铁军勇冠全国
    一天产铁六万三千多吨，远远超过去年全国平均日产量
    新华社南宁17日电　广西环江县后来居上，在钢铁高产周的第一天——15日出产生铁六万三千三百二十一点五吨，另有烧结铁五万一千八百零八点五吨，跃居全国首位。这个县这一天的生铁产量，大约等于解放前广西一个世纪的产量。
    环江县早就是广西炼铁生产的一面红旗，所产生铁质量好，受到柳州市各炼钢单位的欢迎。这天产的生铁，经过中共环江县委第一书记洪华和中共河池县委第一书记于子明及前来参加钢铁生产的北京大学、地质学院学生的验收，证明都是灰口铁和白口铁。
    环江县只有十六万人口，经过大搞钢铁生产的总动员和大辩论，除原有六万固定的钢铁野战军外，后方又有二万七千人开赴钢铁前线。宜山、河池两县也派来一支二万三千人的野战军，带着工具和车辆马匹前来支援。他们在“全国、全自治区、全专区一盘棋”的口号下，并肩作战，奋战四昼夜后，储备了煤炭等燃料二十三万七千吨，矿石二十二万多吨，在五个原料燃料丰富的地方，新建大、中、小型炼铁窑二万一千八百三十七个，加原有小土高炉，共二万二千零九十一个炼铁炉和炼铁窑，为高产作好了充分的准备。
    在大放“卫星”期间，全县各级党委书记深入炉边、工地，一面参加生产，一面进行政治思想工作。所有工地上都开展了宣传鼓动工作与评比竞赛。
