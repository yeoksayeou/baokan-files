Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, October 26th: The Baghdad Pact Organization, the tool of American and British aggression in the Middle East, announced that it has decided to "temporarily" move its headquarters, originally located in the Iraqi capital, to Ankara. The Secretary-General of this treaty organization has also been changed to Bülent Kösteli of the Turkish Foreign Ministry. This position was originally held by Khalidy of the Iraqi Said government.

The forced announcement of the relocation of the headquarters shows the failure of the attempt by American and British imperialism to use the Baghdad Pact Organization to restrain Iraq after the success of the Iraqi revolution. The success of the Iraqi July Revolution broke a leg of the Baghdad Pact. Its headquarters, which had been located in Baghdad since its establishment in 1955, was closed by the Iraqi Republican government three months ago.

The statement issued by the Baghdad Pact Organization in Ankara on the 23rd vaguely stated that the decision to move the headquarters was due to "considering the current situation." According to reports, the Secretary-General of the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the Iranian and Pakistani Ambassadors to Turkey, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the United States and Britain to Turkey held a secret meeting and made this decision.

Although the Iraqi Republic has never participated in any meetings of the Baghdad Pact Organization, this military bloc still does not change the name of the so-called "Baghdad Pact Organization" which no longer has Baghdad.

### 巴格达集团在巴格达难立足  总部黯然迁往安卡拉

    巴格达集团在巴格达难立足
    总部黯然迁往安卡拉
    新华社26日讯　安卡拉消息：美英在中东的侵略工具——巴格达条约组织宣布，它决定把原来在伊拉克首都的总部“暂时”搬到安卡拉去。这个条约组织的秘书长也改由土耳其外交部的布伦特·克斯特利担任，这个职务原来是由伊拉克赛义德政府的哈利迪担任的。
    被迫宣布迁移总部一事显示，美英帝国主义在伊拉克革命成功后还想用巴格达条约组织来束缚伊拉克的企图的失败。伊拉克七月革命的成功使巴格达条约断了一条腿。它从1955年成立以来就设在巴格达的总部，在三个月前就已经被伊拉克共和国政府封闭。
    在23日由巴格达条约组织在安卡拉发表的这项声明只含含糊糊地说，决定迁移总部是由于“考虑到当前的情况”。据报道，土耳其外交部秘书长、伊朗和巴基斯坦驻土耳其大使、美国和英国驻土耳其的临时代办举行了一次秘密会议，作出了这个决定。
    尽管伊拉克共和国从来就没有参加过巴格达条约组织的任何会议，这个军事集团还不改换这个已经没有巴格达的所谓“巴格达条约组织”的名称。
