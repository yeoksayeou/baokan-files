Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 21st: "Rodong Sinmun" today published an article by General Xu Zhe, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, to bid farewell to the last group of Chinese People's Volunteers withdrawing from Korea.

The article said that as the Chinese People's Volunteers are about to complete their total withdrawal, the US imperialists not only refuse to withdraw from South Korea, but also ship atomic weapons and missile weapons to South Korea, strengthen the Lee Seung-man army, and intensify the tense situation in Korea. At the same time, the US imperialists are also increasing their forces in the Taiwan Strait area, frantically carrying out blatant provocative acts against the Chinese people.

The article pointed out that no matter what means the US imperialists use, they cannot intimidate the Korean and Chinese people. The US imperialists must recognize that if they disregard the people's desire for peace and ignite the flames of war, they will undoubtedly suffer heavier blows and failures several times greater than the Korean War. The article said that the people of Korea and China will certainly defeat any conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors and victoriously complete the great cause of peaceful reunification of Korea and the liberation of Taiwan.

The article said that the combat friendship between the people and armies of Korea and China, cemented with blood, is a reliable guarantee for safeguarding the freedom, independence, and peace of Asia for the people of both countries. No force in the world can destroy this great friendship and unity. The Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army will cherish the friendship and unity between the people and armies of Korea and China as they cherish their own eyes, and will further consolidate and develop this friendship.

    徐哲中将撰文送别志愿军说
    帝国主义吓不倒中朝人民
    新华社平壤21日电　“劳动新闻”今天登载了朝鲜人民军总政治局局长徐哲中将为送别中国人民志愿军最后一批撤离朝鲜的部队所写的文章。
    文章说，在中国人民志愿军即将结束全部撤军工作的时候，美帝国主义不仅仍然不肯撤出南朝鲜，并且还向南朝鲜运进原子武器和导弹武器，增强李承晚军队的实力，加剧了朝鲜的紧张局势。同时，美帝国主义还在台湾海峡地区增强兵力，疯狂进行反对中国人民的露骨的挑衅行为。
    文章指出，不管美帝国主义用什么手段，都吓不倒朝中人民。美帝国主义必须认清，如果美帝国主义无视人民对和平的愿望，竟然燃起战争的火焰，毫无疑问，它将遭到几倍于朝鲜战争的更加沉重的打击和失败。文章说，朝中两国人民必将击退美国侵略者的任何阴谋诡计，胜利完成和平统一朝鲜和解放台湾的伟大事业。
    文章说，朝中两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是维护两国人民的自由、独立和亚洲和平的可靠保证。世界上没有任何力量可以摧毁这一伟大的友谊和团结。朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵将像爱护眼珠一样，爱护朝中两国人民和军队间的友谊和团结，并将进一步巩固和发展这种友谊。
