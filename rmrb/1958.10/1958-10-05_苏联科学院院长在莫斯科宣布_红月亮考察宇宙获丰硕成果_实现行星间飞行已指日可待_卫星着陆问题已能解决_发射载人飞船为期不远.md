Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th Dispatch from TASS, Moscow: Soviet Academy of Sciences President Nesmeyanov delivered a report at a Moscow gathering of public representatives and scientists celebrating the first anniversary of the satellite launch on the 3rd, discussing the fruitful results achieved by the first three Soviet artificial satellites.

Nesmeyanov said that the Soviet satellites successfully solved the problem of ensuring complete sealing. The automatic thermal regulation system is fully effective. The third satellite has consistently maintained a temperature between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius. The solar-powered semiconductor battery-operated radio transmitter installed on the third satellite has been working reliably for four and a half months so far.

Speaking about the scientific intelligence obtained by the Soviet satellites, Nesmeyanov said that at an altitude of 226 kilometers to 228 kilometers, the density of the atmosphere is approximately three ten-millionths of a gram per cubic meter. This is about five to ten times the previously estimated value. These materials were obtained from an analysis of the satellite's deceleration. When the altitude is increased by another 100 kilometers, the density decreases to one-tenth to one-twelfth. Using the scientific results obtained by Soviet artificial satellites, many problems of upper atmospheric physics can be elucidated in a new way.

Nesmeyanov also spoke about significant new information regarding the interrelationship of heavy and superheavy atomic nuclei in primary cosmic rays. According to the materials obtained by the Cherenkov counter, the number of heavy nuclei is only one ten-thousandth of the number of lighter iron, nickel, and cobalt nuclei.

He pointed out that determining the temperature of electrons in the ionosphere is an important result of satellite exploration. It has now been clarified that this temperature is much higher than the temperature of neutral particles and ions at the altitude where the satellite flies. This unexpected result must be further studied. He said that it has now been discovered that there is a "halo" of fast-moving electrons around the earth.

Nesmeyanov said that the most recent prospects for space navigation are the creation of "permanent" and orientation-fixed artificial satellites, the solution of the problem of satellites returning to Earth, and the launching of rockets to the moon and the nearest planets. A further step is the creation of interstellar stations. He also said that the realization of interplanetary flight is not far off. The fact that several Soviet satellites have circled the Earth thousands of times shows that there is no need to worry about the danger of meteor impacts during interplanetary travel.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd Dispatch: Professor Dobronravov, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, said that Soviet scientists and engineers are now fully capable of solving some technical problems to manufacture a satellite that will not be incinerated due to entering the atmosphere or collision upon landing on a planet.

This was stated by Dobronravov in an article published in "Moscow Truth" today to commemorate the first anniversary of the launch of the first artificial satellite. He said that the engine of such a satellite should have sufficient fuel reserves to allow the satellite to return to Earth within a predetermined period. The engine should also act as a brake on the satellite when it enters the dense atmosphere, preventing it from burning up. For this purpose, it is also necessary to stabilize the satellite to prevent any somersaulting. The single-stage rocket with experimental animals launched by the Soviet Union to a height of 450 kilometers on August 27 already had a stabilizing device to prevent the rocket body from overturning.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th Dispatch from TASS, Moscow: On the eve of the first anniversary of the launch of the first artificial satellite, Academician Sedov, a Soviet expert in interstellar navigation, told a TASS reporter that the launch of manned rocket spaceships to interplanetary space and the nearest planets is not far off. Now, it is possible to talk about interplanetary flight as a practical plan that can be realized in the near future.

Sedov said in the conversation that before this, some automatic exploration laboratories will undoubtedly be launched into the sky to engage in interplanetary flight. These laboratories will be equipped with complex radio and television instruments to send back to Earth the results of on-the-spot investigations of the Moon, Mars, and Venus.

Academician Sedov emphasized that cosmonautics can only achieve further achievements under conditions where peace is maintained. The rapid development and realization of future large-scale rocket plans require international cooperation. He said that we, like the vast number of scientists in various countries of the world, hope that this cooperation will become possible and that it will help to transfer the forces currently spent on military technology to the peaceful exploration of the depths of the universe.

### 苏联科学院院长在莫斯科宣布  红月亮考察宇宙获丰硕成果  实现行星间飞行已指日可待  卫星着陆问题已能解决  发射载人飞船为期不远

    苏联科学院院长在莫斯科宣布
    红月亮考察宇宙获丰硕成果  实现行星间飞行已指日可待
    卫星着陆问题已能解决  发射载人飞船为期不远
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫3日在莫斯科公众代表和科学家庆祝卫星上天一周年的大会上作了报告，谈到了苏联头三个人造卫星所取得的丰硕成果。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，苏联几个卫星成功地解决了保证完全密封的问题。自动热调节系统是完全有效的。第三个卫星始终保持着摄氏十五到二十度之间的温度。在第三个卫星上装设的靠太阳能半导体电池组工作的无线电发射机，到目前为止已经可靠地工作了四个半月。
    在谈到苏联卫星获得的科学情报时，?斯米扬诺夫说，在二百二十六公里到二百二十八公里高空中，大气的密度约为每立方公尺一千万分之三克。这约为早先设想的数值的五倍到十倍。这些材料是根据对卫星减速情况的分析获得的。在高度再增加一百公里时，密度就降低到十分之一到十二分之一。利用苏联人造卫星获得的科学结果，可以用新的方式阐明许多高层大气物理学问题。
    ?斯米扬诺夫还谈到了关于原始宇宙线中重原子核和超重原子核相互关系的有意义的新情报。根据契连科夫计数器获得的材料，重核的数目只等于比较轻的铁、镍、钴核数目的万分之一。
    他指出，确定电离层电子的温度，是卫星考察的一项重要结果。现在已经阐明，这个温度大大高于在卫星飞经的高度上中性粒子和离子的温度。这个出人意料的结果还必须进一步研究。他说，现在还发现，地球周围有一圈由快速运动电子组成的“光环”。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，宇宙航行方面最近的前景，就是制成“永久的”和方位固定的人造卫星，解决卫星回到地面的问题，发射火箭到月球和最近的行星上。再进一步就是制造星际站。他还说，实现行星间的飞行也为期不远了。而苏联几个卫星围绕地球运行了几千圈这一事实表明，在行星际旅行中用不着担心流星撞击的危险。
    新华社莫斯科3日电　苏联物理数学博士多勃隆拉沃夫教授说，苏联科学家和工程师现在完全能够解决一些技术问题，来制造一种不会因进入大气圈，或因在行星上着陆时的碰撞，而焚毁的卫星。
    这是多勃隆拉沃夫今天在“莫斯科真理报”为纪念第一个人造卫星上天一周年发表的文章中说的。他说，这种卫星的发动机应当带有足以使卫星在预定期限内回到地面所必需的燃料储备。发动机还应当在卫星进入稠密大气层时对卫星起刹制作用，使其不致焚毁。为此还必需使卫星稳定，不发生任何翻斤斗现象。而今年8月27日苏联向四百五十公里的高空发射的一个带试验动物的单级火箭，就已经带有防止火箭体翻转的稳定装置了。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联星际航行专家塞道夫院士在第一个人造卫星发射一周年前夕对塔斯社记者说，向行星际空间和最近的行星发射载人的火箭飞船已经为期不远。现在，已经可以把行星际飞行做为不久的将来即可实现的实际计划来谈论了。
    塞道夫在谈话中说，在这以前无疑将发射一些自动考察试验室到天空中从事行星际飞行，这些试验室将装备复杂的无线电和电视仪器，把实地考察月球、火星和金星的结果发回地球。
    塞道夫院士强调说，只有在和平得到维护的条件下，宇宙航行学才能取得进一步的成就。高速发展和实现未来的巨大火箭计划，需要国际合作。他说，我们同世界各国广大科学家一样，希望这种合作成为可能，希望这种合作能有助于使目前花在军事技术方面的力量转移到对宇宙深处的和平考察方面去。
