　　"Whole" and "Half"
    Zhai Wen
    "It is a good thing that students consciously demand the implementation of the half-work, half-study system. It is an inevitable trend for schools to run factories on a large scale. This demand can be approved, and they should be given active support and encouragement." This is an important instruction made by Chairman Mao after inspecting Wuhan University.
    Students consciously demanding the implementation of the half-work, half-study system is a pursuit of the "whole." We should adopt a positive attitude to fulfill it. "Half" work and "half" study may seem to each be just "half," but when the two halves are combined, they become "whole." "Whole" work and "whole" study may seem to be "whole" in form, but they are essentially incomplete. "Whole" work cannot acquire cultural and theoretical knowledge. Without cultural and theoretical knowledge, one is not a complete person. In today's era when the people have mastered their own destiny, it will seriously hinder the development of one's career. Workers and peasants are unwilling to be such incomplete people, so in the nationwide cultural revolution, they are striving forward to conquer the cultural fortress and make themselves whole people. "Whole" study cannot be further combined with productive labor. Having only book knowledge and no practical knowledge of productive labor, one will accomplish nothing and become a laughingstock today, let alone be considered a complete person.
    Now it is good that factories and schools are vigorously promoting the half-work, half-study system, which can enable workers to quickly become knowledgeable and intellectuals to accelerate their integration with workers and peasants. Both sides are advancing simultaneously toward the development of new communist people, and will more quickly create "whole" people. Isn't this the case? From the perspective of schools, since factories were established on a large scale, many people have begun to understand the relationship between productive labor and socialist construction from productive labor, and have realized that the comprehensive leap forward of the motherland is inseparable from the selfless labor of the people of the motherland, and that everyone's labor is for others as well as for themselves. Their thoughts and feelings are linked to the grand cause of socialist construction, and the views of despising manual labor and manual laborers have begun to collapse in practice. The free and undisciplined habits of intellectuals are no longer acceptable. Productive labor requires strict organizational discipline and centralized and unified command. In collective labor, the role of the individual is not so remarkable. Without the collective, the individual can accomplish nothing. The spirit of cooperation and collectivism become indispensable. What is the result of this? That is: bourgeois ideology and individualism will naturally gradually decrease, communist collectivism will gradually increase, and mental labor and physical labor will be combined. The relationship between teachers and students will also change from the old to the new, becoming an equal relationship, and so on. These are all buds of communism, and these cannot be achieved without combining education with productive labor.
    The students of Wuhan University have realized the significance of labor from their own experiences and tasted the honor, happiness, and rich knowledge that the fruits of labor bring. They will certainly ask: "Half-work, half-study can not only improve teaching quality, but also not extend study time. It conforms to the spirit of the general line and the principles of communism. Why not quickly approve our half-work, half-study?" In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production, cultural and educational undertakings, and people's communist ideology, the quality of our entire people is also developing in a leap forward manner. That is, everyone is striving to transform themselves into complete people by advancing toward the aspects they lack. The demands of the students of Wuhan University are precisely such valuable demands, and they should indeed be fully approved.

　　“全”和“半”
    翟文
    “学生自觉地要求实行半工半读是好事情，是学校大办工厂的必然趋势，对这种要求可以批准，并应给他们以积极的支持和鼓励。”这是毛主席视察武汉大学后作出的重要指示。
    学生自觉地要求实行半工半读，这是一种求全。我们应该采取积极的态度来成全它。半工和半读看起来都是个“半”，但两个半一结合就成了“全”。全工和全读在形式上都是个全，但实质上都是不全。全工不能取得文化理论知识，没有文化理论知识，是不完全的人；在人民掌握了自己命运的今天，就会严重地阻碍自己的事业发展。工农劳动者不愿作这种不完全的人，所以在全民的文化大革命中，他们正在奋力前进，要攻克文化堡垒，使自己成为全人。全读不能进一步结合生产劳动，只有书本知识，没有生产劳动实践的知识，在今天就更会一事无成笑话百出，更不能说是完全的人了。
    现在可好了，工厂和学校大搞半工半读，就可以使工人迅速知识化，知识分子加速工农化，两方面齐头并进地向共产主义新人发展，将更快地造就出全人来。事实不正是这样吗？从学校里看，自从大办工厂以后，不少人已从生产劳动中开始懂得了生产劳动和社会主义建设的关系，认识了祖国的全面跃进是和祖国人民的忘我劳动分不开的，每个人的劳动是为别人也是为自己。他们的思想感情就和社会主义建设的宏伟事业联系起来，轻视体力劳动和轻视体力劳动者的观点在实践中就开始土崩瓦解了，知识分子的自由散漫习气不行了，生产劳动要求严格的组织纪律和集中统一的指挥。在集体劳动中，个人的作用也就不是那末了不起了，离开了集体个人就无所作为了，协作精神和集体主义就成为不可少的东西了。这样做的结果是什么呢？那就是：资产阶级思想、个人主义就自然逐渐减少，共产主义集体主义就逐渐增加，脑力劳动和体力劳动从而也就结合起来，师生之间的关系也由旧向新变为平等的关系，等等。这些都是共产主义的萌芽，这些离开教育结合生产劳动是办不到的。
    武汉大学的学生从切身的经验中体会到了劳动的意义，尝到了劳动的成果给人的荣誉、快乐和丰富的知识，他们当然会提出：“半工半读既能提高教学质量，又不会延长学习时间，既符合总路线的精神，又符合共产主义的原则，为什么不很快的批准我们半工半读？”在工农业生产、文化教育事业和人的共产主义思想大跃进中，我们全民的素质也正在跃进地发展，这就是人人朝着自己所缺乏的那一方面前进而力求改造自己成为完全的人。武汉大学同学们的要求正是这样一种可贵的要求，这的确是完全应该批准的。
