    Unemployment Doubles, Coal and Steel Production Decreases
    Not Enough Hospital Beds, Theaters Close
    More Unemployment: According to official British statistics, as of September 15th, the number of unemployed in Britain had reached 475,986, accounting for 2.2% of the workforce. This is the highest figure in six years.
    Since August of this year, the number of unemployed in Britain has surged. In just one month, 30,000 people lost their jobs. The unemployment situation is particularly severe in Northern Ireland, where the unemployed account for 8.1% of the workforce.
    From September of last year to now, the number of unemployed in Britain has doubled.
    More Crime: The number of criminal cases in Britain has been increasing year after year. According to recent official figures, the number of criminal cases in 1957 doubled compared to 1938. One-third of the criminals are young people under the age of twenty-one. The degeneration of young people has become a serious social problem. In the Notting Hill area of London, 40% of young people are "Teddy Boys".
    More Car Accidents: There were 300,000 car accidents in 1957, the highest number ever recorded. According to official estimates, there will be even more car accidents in 1958 than last year.
    Steel Production Decreases: For several months, British steel production has been declining. Compared to the same period last year, production decreased by 10% in June and 13% in July. By August, it plummeted 20%. In August, the average daily output was only about 42,000 tons.
    Coal Production Decreases: Coal production is also continuing to decline. Since the beginning of this year, a total of only 160 million tons have been produced.
    Fewer Movie Theaters: The number of moviegoers in Britain last year was 45% lower than in 1948. The downward trend is continuing: a 24% reduction in the first quarter of this year, and a further reduction of more than 15% in the second quarter. The Rank Organisation, Britain's largest film monopoly, which owns 460 cinemas, has decided to close eighty of them.
    Fewer Hospitals: Due to the lack of medical facilities, 440,000 people were waiting for medical treatment at the end of 1957. At St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester, patients with common illnesses have to wait three to four years for a bed. In Britain, almost no new hospitals have been built since the war.
    Fewer Schools: School construction in the first half of 1958 was 20% less than in the same period in 1957, and school construction in London from 1959 to 1960 will be reduced by 60%.

    失业翻一番　煤钢都减产
    病床不够用　剧院把门关
    失业多：根据英国官方统计，到9月15日止，英国失业人数已达四十七万五千九百八十六人，占就业人数的2.2％。这是六年以来的最高数字。
    今年8月以来，英国失业人数猛增。仅仅在一个月内，就有三万人失去了工作。特别在北爱尔兰，失业情况更为严重，失业者占就业人数的8.1％。
    从去年9月到现在，英国的失业人数整整地翻了一番。
    犯罪多：英国的犯罪案件，几年不断激增，据最近官方公布，1957年的犯罪案件比1938年增加了一倍。三分之一的犯罪者是二十一岁以下的青年。青年的堕落已成为严重的社会问题，在伦敦的诺丁山区，青年中40％是阿飞。
    车祸多：1957年的车祸达三十万件，为历年来最高数字。据官方预计，1958年的车祸将比去年更多。
    钢产减少：几个月以来，英国钢的产量一直在下降。与去年同期相比，6月份产量下降10％，7月下降13％。到了8月，猛跌20％，在8月份，每天的平均产量只有四万二千吨左右。
    煤产减少：煤的产量也在继续下降。今年以来，一共只生产了160百万吨。
    电影院减少：英国去年的电影观众，比1948年减少了45％。下降的趋势仍在继续：今年第一季度缩减24％，第二季度又缩减15％以上。拥有四百六十个影院的英国最大的电影垄断组织朗克公司，已决定关闭八十个影院。
    医院少：由于医疗机构缺乏，1957年末有四十四万人等着治疗疾病。曼彻斯特的圣·玛莉医院，普通疾病患者要等三、四年后才能有个病床。在英国，战后几乎没有建筑新的医院。
    学校少：1958年前半年比1957年同期，学校建筑少了20％，伦敦1959—60年的学校建筑减少了60％。
