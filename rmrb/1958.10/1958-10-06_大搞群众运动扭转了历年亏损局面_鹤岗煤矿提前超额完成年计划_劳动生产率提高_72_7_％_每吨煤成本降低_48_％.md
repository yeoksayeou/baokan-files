Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th: The Hegang Coal Mine has comprehensively exceeded this year's Great Leap Forward plan three months ahead of schedule. Labor productivity increased by 72.7%, and the cost of raw coal per ton decreased by 48% compared to the national plan, thus reversing the coal mine's losses over the years.

After rectification, the leading cadres of the Hegang Coal Mine criticized the past idea that mass movements would "disrupt normal production order." They used mass movements to lead production and organized the masses to participate in production management. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses soared, and thousands of innovation proposals and actions broke down old conventions and regulations, rapidly pushing production towards small-scale mechanization and automation. This saved more than 6,000 people to open small mines and expand coal mining sites. In particular, starting in September, hydraulic mining was used more extensively, increasing coal production from more than 810,000 tons in August to more than 1,050,000 tons in September.

The mine has also successfully tested the world's latest hydraulic transportation technology using horseshoe-shaped pipe lifting and coal feeders, as well as cutting-edge technologies such as underground coal seam gasification.

Currently, the employees of the Hegang Coal Mine are continuing to work hard to produce 10 million tons of coal for the whole year.

    大搞群众运动扭转了历年亏损局面
    鹤岗煤矿提前超额完成年计划
    劳动生产率提高72.7％　每吨煤成本降低48％
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　鹤岗煤矿已经提前三个月全面超额完成了今年全年的跃进计划，劳动生产率提高72.7％，每吨原煤成本比国家计划降低48％，从而转变了这个煤矿历年来的亏损局面。
    鹤岗煤矿经过整风以后，在领导干部中批判了过去认为搞群众运动就“打乱了正常生产秩序”的思想，用搞群众运动的方法领导生产，组织群众参加生产管理，因此群众干劲冲天，用成千上万项的革新建议和行动，冲垮了陈规旧律，使生产迅速走向了小型机械化和自动化，从而节省出六千多人进行开小井和扩大采煤场子。特别是从9月份开始，更大量采用水力采煤，使煤产量由8月份的八十一万多吨提高到9月份的一百零五万多吨。
    这个矿还试验成功用马蹄型管提升和喂煤器的世界最新水力运输，以及煤层地下气化等尖端技术。
    现在，鹤岗煤矿职工正在继续努力为全年产煤一千万吨而奋斗。
