Speaking of Shang Mingzhi, the head of the Xin Village Agricultural Cooperative in Shulu County, Hebei Province, everyone, young and old, calls him the "Zhao Shuli" of Shulu County. The real Zhao Shuli compiled a "Ballads of Li Youcai," but Shang Mingzhi, the "Zhao Shuli" of Shulu County, is composing ballad every day, and the ballads he composes are loved by everyone. He composes ballads to promote every central task. He composes about whatever he sees; he composes about whatever the central task is. He often says, "Whether there is pain or joy in my heart, I have to compose ballads to sing to everyone, otherwise, I will always feel suffocated." The ballads he composes are lively, vivid, easy to understand, and full of clear-cut love and hate. To take a recent example, during the socialist debate in the countryside in the winter of 1957, some cooperative members did not have a sufficient understanding of the superiority of socialism. Shang Mingzhi is a person who grew up walking on a mountain of knives with bare feet in the old society, so he understands better how today's happy life came to be. Therefore, he composed the ballad "Xin Village's Contrast Between Past and Present" with excitement:

    In the past:
    Low-lying, dry, and sandy ditch, nine years out of ten bring no harvest,
    Flying sand obscures the sun, and it's hard for pedestrians to walk.
    Output decreases year by year, drought and flood occur every year,
    Poor people eat chaff and vegetables, landlords and rich peasants eat white flour and oil,
    The wealthy enjoy happiness, the poor are hungry and emaciated,
    In winter, it's cold, shivering with cold,
    Seeing it, my heart is worried, and tears flow from my eyes.
    Now:
    Only two years of cooperation, and the situation has greatly changed.
    Flying sand can't fly up, pedestrians have no difficulty.
    Poor people become rich, and every family has pocket money.
    Families that have been short of food for many years have surplus grain for the first year.
    Tear down the dilapidated houses, and build several new houses.
    Take off the ragged clothes, and wear new clothes.
    The Communist Party has come, and the suffering has come to an end…

After hearing his ballad, the cooperative members were moved to tears and said, "The head of the cooperative truly spoke the words in our hearts!" It immediately aroused the cooperative members' hatred for the local landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, and they launched a ruthless struggle against the bad elements who spread discontent.

Since the Great Leap Forward in agriculture this year, he has become even more active. He composes and sings at any time, constantly inspiring the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. The ballads he composes are full of a kind of revolutionary heroism. After the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results was announced, the people of the whole country cheered and sang. The township held a meeting of all cooperative members and prepared another big red flag, waiting to be awarded to the model unit that implemented the general line. Shang Mingzhi expressed the determination of all the cooperative members of Xin Village to seize the red flag and occupy the red list with great excitement at the meeting:

    Xin Village Cooperative, with strong ambition,
    Strives to be the best in the whole township,
    Go all out, dedicate strength,
    Greater, faster, better, and more economical methods are strong.
    Compare technology, compare originality,
    The cultural revolution is turning the world upside down.
    Ten thousand catties of cotton, ten thousand catties of grain,
    Set a surprising new example.
    Work and sing,
    Do what you sing, and your heart is clear,
    Industry and agriculture develop together,
    Build the motherland and defend national defense,
    Seize the red flag, occupy the red list,
    Strive to make every team's red flag fly.

After he finished reciting this ballad, thunderous applause immediately erupted throughout the venue, and the slogan "Learn from Xin Village Cooperative!" was shouted.

In early August, the county held a meeting of heads of agricultural cooperatives, conveying the provincial party committee's call for marshals to ascend to the platform and satellites to go into space in terms of agricultural crops. They also visited various townships to see the well-grown crops. After Shang Mingzhi returned to the cooperative, he held a meeting of cooperative members and conveyed the spirit of the meeting with full passion:

    Ideological emancipation, golden ears of grain shine,
    Dare to think and dare to do, persistent effort is necessary,
    Strive for a thousand-catty cooperative, so that cooperative members live well.
    Each team launches satellites, crops must ascend to the platform,
    Scare the American imperialists, China will be rich and strong forever.

Shang Mingzhi has a very low level of education. He only went to elementary school for two years when he was a child. After dropping out of school, he has been engaged in farming, and he has gradually forgotten the words he learned. However, he is very concerned about every change and development in society, and he wants to write all this down and tell everyone. When he composes ballads, he doesn't know how to write some words. Sometimes he struggles with a word for a long time, so he has to draw a symbol and then ask others later. What he writes in the ballads is exactly what the vast number of cooperative members are doing and what is in their hearts. He is a worker and a "ballad poet." He is not only the well-known "Zhao Shuli" of Shulu County and a good political propagandist in the cooperative, but also a good cooperative leader supported and praised by all the cooperative members. If you ask him why he can write such popular ballads with such a low level of education, he will gratefully say:

    With the good leadership of the Party,
    Even a rough fellow can write articles,
    I can write new ballads,
    Because the Party nurtures me.
    In the past, we were the lowest of the low,
    Today, we are the masters.
    We must manage the affairs of the country,
    And make culture our master.
    We can write and sing,
    The cultural revolution is turning the world upside down,
    In order to promote great production,
    And bring people's lives to heaven.

    束鹿县的赵树理
    杨善元
    提起河北省束鹿县辛村农业社长尚明智来，不论是大人、小孩，人人都称他是束鹿县的“赵树理”。真正的赵树理编出了一本“李有才板话”，而束鹿县的“赵树理”——尚明智每天都在编板话，他编出的板话人人爱听。在每一个中心工作到来时他都要编板话，进行宣传。他是见到什么就编什么；中心工作是什么就编什么。他常说：“不论是心里有痛苦，有欢乐都要编出板话来唱给大家听，要不，心里就总觉得憋的慌。”他编出的板话活泼生动，通俗易懂，爱憎分明。远的不说，就说在1957年冬季的农村社会主义大辩论吧，那时候有些社员对社会主义的优越性认识不足。尚明智是从小像光着脚板走刀山一样打旧社会里走过来的人，他更懂得今天的幸福生活是怎样得来的，于是他用激动的心情编出了“辛村今昔对比”的板话：
    过去是：
    低洼旱沙沟，十年九不收，
    飞沙蔽天日，行人也难走。
    产量年年减，旱涝年年有，
    穷人吃糠菜，地富白面油，
    财主享清福，穷人饥黄瘦，
    冬季天寒冷，冻的打哆嗦，
    目睹心发忧，两眼泪交流。
    现在是：
    合作才两年，光景大改变。
    飞沙飞不起，行人不作难。
    穷人变富足，家家有零钱。
    多年缺粮户，余粮头一年。
    拆了破旧房，新房盖几间。
    脱去破衣裳，新衣身上穿。
    来了共产党，苦难到了头。……社员们听了他这段快板后，都感动得流出泪来，说：“社长真正说出了我们大家的心里话！”立刻激起了社员们对村内地富坏分子的仇恨，积极地向散布不满言论的坏分子展开了无情斗争。
    今年农业大跃进以来，他更活跃了。他随时编，随口唱，时时都在鼓舞着社员们的生产干劲。他编出的板话富有一种革命英雄主义的火劲。鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线公布以后，全国人民欢呼歌唱，乡里召开了全乡社员大会，并又准备下一面大红旗，等着将来奖给实现总路线的模范单位。尚明智以万分激动的心情，在大会上表示了辛村社全体社员们夺红旗、占红榜的决心：
    辛村社，志气刚，
    力争上游盖全乡，
    鼓干劲，献力量，
    多快好省办法强。
    比技术、比首创，
    文化革命闹翻江。
    万斤皮棉万斤粮，
    做出惊人新榜样。
    边劳动、边歌唱，
    做啥唱啥心明亮，
    工业农业齐发展，
    建设祖国保国防，
    夺红旗，占红榜，
    争取每队红旗扬。他念完这段板话后，立刻在全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声，喊起了“向辛村社学习！”的口号。
    8月上旬，县里召开了各农业社长会议，传达了省委关于农作物方面元帅升帐、卫星上天的号召，又到各乡参观了长得好的农作物，尚明智回到社里以后召开社员大会，以满腹激情传达了这次会议精神：
    思想要解放，谷穗放金光，
    敢想又敢做，钻劲要经常，
    争取千斤社，社员生活强。
    各队放卫星，作物要升帐，
    吓破美帝胆，中国永富强。
    尚明智文化水平很低，小时候只上过二年小学，失学后就一直干庄稼活，慢慢地把学的字也都忘光了，但是他很关心社会上的每一变化和发展，很想把这一切写出来告诉大家。在他编板话时有些字不会写，有时为一个字憋半天，他只得画上个符号，以后去请教别人。他在板话上所写的也就正是广大社员所做的和广大社员们的心里话。他是劳动者，又是“快板诗人”。他不但是出了名的束鹿县的“赵树理”，社里的好政治鼓动家，而且还是全体社员拥护赞扬的好社长。你若问他文化水平这样低，为什么却能写出这样受人欢迎的板话来，他会感激地说：
    有了党的好领导，
    老粗也能写文章，
    我能写出新板话，
    是党对我来培养。
    过去咱是人下人，
    今天咱把主人当。
    国家大事咱要管，
    更要把文化主人当。
    又能写又能唱，
    文化革命闹翻江，
    为的推动大生产，
    使人民生活上天堂。
