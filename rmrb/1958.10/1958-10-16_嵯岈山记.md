You won't find the name "Mount Cuya" on a map. It's a remote mountain area located on the eastern foot of the Funiu Mountains in Henan, with a total population of just over 40,000 people living in the mountains and below. This area didn't attract much attention in the past, but since the release of high-yield wheat "satellites" and the establishment of people's communes, Mount Cuya has become a nationally renowned "holy land." From early July to mid-September, in just two and a half months, over 80,000 people visited this mountain area. Almost all provinces, autonomous regions, or directly administered municipalities across the country organized visiting delegations, and a small number of international friends also came to Mount Cuya.

Nature treats the residents of Mount Cuya with cold indifference. There is not much arable land to begin with, and it contains a lot of sand and gravel, with a severe lack of organic matter, which the locals call "land of sorrow," with very low grain yields in the past. Coupled with the extortion and exploitation by bureaucrats, landlords, and unscrupulous merchants during the reactionary ruling period, people ate grain in the summer, soup in the autumn, vegetables in the winter, and endured famine in the spring, barely eking out a living.

Since liberation, Mount Cuya has begun to change its appearance, and people hardly recognize it anymore. Feudal exploitation has been completely eliminated, agricultural production has soared to unprecedented levels, and grain-deficient households have received state relief. However, by 1953, wheat yields were fixed, and in some places, they were less than fifteen jin per mu. After collectivization, seven advanced cooperatives were established in the region, with large-scale water conservancy projects, and production gradually increased. By 1957, wheat yields reached one hundred and twenty-seven jin per mu, which was much better than in the past. In the winter of 1957, the farmers of Mount Cuya worked hard, constructing water conservancy projects, and transforming 85% of the cultivated land into irrigated land. Cadres took the lead, cultivated experimental plots, carried out deep plowing and close planting, and educated the vast number of farmers with facts, overcoming people's conservative ideas. This spring, there was no rain for three months, but large-scale wheat production still reached 653.3 jin per mu, more than five times the yield of 1957. Wheat has since shed its "low-yield" label, and the grain shortage situation has been fundamentally changed.

The great victory on the grain production front inspired all the farmers, raised the people's socialist consciousness, and increased the Party's prestige among the people. After the old contradictions were resolved, new contradictions arose. Small-scale agricultural cooperative organizations could no longer meet the needs of large-scale production. To build reservoirs in a planned way, complete river network systems, develop mountainous areas, and carry out basic construction, it was necessary to uniformly allocate all labor. The small cooperatives composed of hundreds of households in the past could not complete such tasks. Thus, the farmers of Mount Cuya began to demand that small cooperatives be merged into larger cooperatives, that large cooperatives be merged into single collective farms, and finally developed into satellite people's communes.

After the establishment of the people's commune, its benefits and advantages far exceeded general expectations. First of all, the expansion from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes resolved internal contradictions between cooperatives, overcame departmentalism, fundamentally changed private ownership concepts, and established communist ideology. The people's commune broke through the limitations of agricultural production, making it possible to comprehensively utilize mountainous areas on a large scale, run factories, build schools, and achieve universal conscription and the integration of labor and military affairs. After the establishment of the people's commune, the grain supply system was quickly implemented, along with a distribution system of wages plus bonuses, thus greatly improving and raising people's living standards. The people's commune highly collectivized labor production, implemented military-style organization, combat-style action, and public canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups fully mobilized young and middle-aged women for labor, thus thoroughly liberating the productive forces in the countryside.

Thus, in a very short period of time, the most backward region leaped to become the most advanced region. This is the historical miracle created by the people of Mount Cuya.

Please see how the members of the satellite people's commune use快板诗 (a kind of Chinese rhythmic storytelling) to describe the upcoming prospects:

With great ambition, all commune members strive,
Hard work for three years, no idle time.
When that time of great change arrives,
The whole commune will look like the Soviet Union.
Agricultural production will be mechanized,
Factories will stand like Anshan.
Cattle and sheep in flocks, pigs in pens,
Green forests blocking the sun, the sky unseen.
Apples grow as big as watermelons,
Cotton bolls like chicken eggs gleam.
Carp grow larger than boats,
Grain harvests pile up like a mountain dream.
Every year, celebrate with great joy,
Rice, noodles, fish, and meat every meal employ.
All houses will be replaced with new ones,
Every household living in a building of stone.
Streets paved with asphalt,
Colorful electric lights on both sides shown.
Bathhouses, theaters, and cinemas grand,
People's parks and nursing homes at hand.
Young men and women enter university,
Each becomes red and expert, you see.
The motherland needs talents, it is true,
Everyone is a technician, through and through.
Children all live in nurseries,
Women giving birth stay in maternity.
During rest, there are clubs to enjoy,
On holidays, visit Mount Cuya, oh boy!

    嵯岈山记
    胡愈之　敬季超
    你休想在地图上找到嵯岈山这一个地名。它是位置在河南伏牛山脉东脚的一个偏僻的山区，山上山下的居民总共也只有四万多。这个地区过去不大引起人们的注意，但是自从放出小麦丰产的大卫星和建立了人民公社以后，嵯岈山就成为全国闻名的“圣地”了。从7月初到9月中旬为止，只不过两个半月时间，到这个山区参观的就有八万人之多。几乎全国所有的省、自治区或直属市，都组织了参观团，还有少数的国际友人都来到了嵯岈山。
    自然界对待嵯岈山的居民是冷酷无情的。耕地本来就不多，并且含砂石很多，有机质很缺乏，老乡们称作“伤心地”，在过去产粮很低。加上反动统治时期官僚、地主、奸商的敲诈剥削，夏天吃粮，秋天喝汤，冬天吃菜，春天度荒，人们的生命就是这样地勉强支持下去的。
    解放以后，嵯岈山开始改变了面貌，人们难得认识它了。封建剥削完全消灭了，农业生产空前高涨，缺粮户得到国家的救济。但是到了1953年，小麦定产，有些地方每亩还不到十五斤。合作化以后，全区建立了七个高级社，大搞水利，生产逐步提高。到1957年小麦亩产就有一百二十七斤，情况比过去好多了。1957年冬季，嵯岈山的农民大干苦干，兴修水利，把85％的耕地都改成了水浇地。干部带头，搞试验田，进行深耕密植，用事实教育了广大农民，克服了人们的保守思想。今年春间三个月没有雨，小麦大面积生产，仍然达到亩产六百五十三点三斤，为1957年亩产量的五倍多。小麦从此摘掉了“低产”的帽子，缺粮的情况也从此基本上改变了。
    粮食生产战线上的大胜仗，鼓舞了所有的农民，提高了人民的社会主义觉悟，增加了党在人民群众中间的威信。旧的矛盾解决以后，又产生了新的矛盾。小规模的农业社组织，已经不能满足大生产的需要。要有计划地兴修水库，完成河网化，开发山区，进行基本建设，必须统一调配全部劳动力，过去由几百户所组成的小社，是不能完成这样的任务的。就是这样，嵯岈山的农民开始要求由小社并大社，由大社并成单一的集体农庄，最后发展为卫星人民公社。
    人民公社成立以后，它的好处，它的优越性，远远超过了一般人的预计。首先，由农业社扩大为人民公社，解决社与社之间的内部矛盾，克服了本位主义，根本改变了私有观念，树立了共产主义思想。人民公社打破了农业生产的局限性，使农村中有可能大搞山区的综合利用，大办工厂，大兴学校，并且做到全民皆兵，劳武结合。人民公社建立以后，很快地实行粮食供给制，实行工资加奖励金的分配制度，因而大大改善和提高人民的生活。人民公社使劳动生产高度集体化，实行组织军事化，行动战斗化，公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组使青壮年妇女全部劳动化，因而彻底解放了农村中的生产力。
    就是这样，在很短的时间内，一个最落后的地区，飞跃成为最先进的地区。这就是嵯岈山人民所创造的历史奇迹。
    请看卫星人民公社的社员们，怎样地用快板诗来描绘即将到来的前景吧：
    全体社员立大志，苦战三年不休闲。到了那时大突变，全社面貌像苏联。农业生产机械化，工厂林立像鞍山。牛羊成群猪满圈，绿林遮日不见天。苹果结成西瓜样，棉花桃儿像鸡蛋。鲤鱼长的比船大，粮食收的堆成山。年年喜庆大吸收，米面鱼肉顿顿餐。房屋全部换新的，户户住在楼上边。街道修成柏油路，五彩电灯两旁安。澡堂戏院电影院，人民公园、养老院。男女青年入大学，个个学成红又专。祖国建设需人材，人人都是技术员。儿童都住托儿所，妇女生育住产院。休息时有俱乐部，假期逛逛嵯岈山。
