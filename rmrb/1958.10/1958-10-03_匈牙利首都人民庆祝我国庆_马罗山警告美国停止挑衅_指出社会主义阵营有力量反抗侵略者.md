    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 2nd: On the afternoon of October 1st, the working people of Budapest, the capital of Hungary, held a meeting at the gymnasium to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of China.
    In his report at the meeting, Marosan, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, after recounting the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction in just nine years, said that imperialism is afraid of the tremendous creative power of the Chinese people and is afraid that Chinese industry will quickly surpass Britain. Therefore, it tries to prevent China's development. However, this is wishful thinking. The power of the united Chinese people is enormous. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, possesses strong political, economic, and military power to resist aggressors. He emphasized that the forces of socialism and peace are invincible. When talking about the aggressive crimes of the American imperialists in the Taiwan Strait area, Marosan pointed out that we firmly stand on the side of the Chinese people and fully support the just struggle of the Chinese people. We resolutely demand that American imperialism return Taiwan to China and stop its provocations in Jinmen and Matsu.
    After praising the achievements made by the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward in industry, agriculture, science, and culture, Marosan pointed out that China's goal is to catch up with or surpass Britain in fifteen years. He said, in our opinion, China will be able to complete this task ahead of schedule.
    Also speaking at the celebration meeting was Ortvay Gyula, General Secretary of the Hungarian Patriotic People's Front.
    Dobi, Ronai, Kisch and other party and government leaders, as well as representatives from all walks of life, attended today's celebration meeting.
    Hao Deqing, the Chinese ambassador to Hungary, also attended today's celebration meeting.
