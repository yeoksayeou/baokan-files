People's Communes Run Steel: Numerous People, Great Momentum, High Enthusiasm
Hebei and Shanxi Produce Communes with Thousand-Ton Output of Pig Iron
Wu'an Wuji Daily Output: 1283 tons Gao Yuan Hongqi Daily Output: 1125 tons
Wu'an Cheng Guan Daily Output: 1005 tons Jincheng Hongqi Daily Output: 1002 tons

(Reported by our newspaper) In the mass movement of the entire population running steel in Wu'an and Gaoyuan counties, Hebei Province, new records of people's communes producing a thousand tons of pig iron daily have emerged.

Wu'an County has two communes with a daily output of one thousand tons. Under the inspiring slogan of "Learn from Lushan, surpass Lushan, strive to be a county of iron and steel marshals," the people of the entire county, the entire party, and the entire population were mobilized to launch an overall battle for steel. On September 29th, the county produced 4,453.83 tons of iron. On this day, after day and night of hard fighting, the Wuji People's Commune ignited 3,703 native furnaces, producing 1,283.6 tons of iron. The Chengguan People's Commune worked hard to seize steel, producing 1,005 tons of iron on the 29th.

The Wuji People's Commune was able to achieve such great results in this steel battle mainly because after the establishment of the people's commune, the entire commune implemented communal dining halls, nurseries, and sewing machinery, liberating more than 14,200 female laborers. The entire county mobilized more than 28,400 laborers to invest in the iron smelting movement, providing sufficient manpower for this iron smelting battle. Due to the unified management of the commune, the resources of the mines were fully utilized, and villages with iron mines and those without iron mines implemented unified management, establishing three iron smelting bases. In addition, the unified use of materials and financial resources by the commune also solved the difficulty of lacking materials in iron smelting. In particular, after communization, the growth of the communist ideology of the members solved many difficulties in terms of materials and financial resources. For example, when coal for iron smelting was temporarily unavailable, the masses automatically contributed 1.8 million catties of coal. Due to the unified allocation of labor by the commune, the method of combining professional teams and shock brigades was adopted, so that mining, transportation, crushing ore, smelting, etc. could be completed according to plan.

The Wuji Commune carried out technological revolution in iron smelting, and enlarged the "Xiajiaosi-style" native furnace, rebuilt a total of 3,700 native furnaces, of which eight native furnaces could produce 10,000 to 50,000 catties per furnace per day. The rebuilt furnaces produced more than twice as much as before on average, and the quality of the iron was also better.

The Hongqi People's Commune in Gaoyuan County also launched a large satellite with a daily output of more than 1,100 tons of iron at 12:00 on September 29.

In addition to overcoming conservative ideas through a commune-wide debate, the Hongqi People's Commune was able to launch this satellite by uniformly allocating and directing labor. The entire commune mobilized workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, dividing into two fronts: steel and agriculture. More than 9,000 people assaulted agricultural production as a reserve army for steel, and more than 15,000 people directly invested in the front line of steel. In this way, the construction, loading, transportation, and smelting assault war started day and night from September 23. In furnace construction, a native closed furnace was also created by digging a kiln underground, without machines or bricks. Three laborers could build one in one day, each with a daily output of four to five tons of iron. The entire commune built 600 such native closed furnaces in two days. In transportation, mining, technology, and other aspects, breakthroughs were also made after hard fighting, ensuring the smooth iron production of native furnaces. At 12:00 on the 28th, 250 furnaces were ignited and put into production. By 12:00 on the 29th, 1,125.3 tons of iron were produced.

(Our newspaper Jincheng, 3rd) The Hongqi People's Commune in Bagong Township, Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, created a new record of producing 1,002 tons of pig iron per commune per day on September 29.

On this day, more than half of the people in the entire commune were involved in the battle of mining, transportation, furnace construction, and iron smelting. The command broadcasts, motor sounds, and laughter on the various iron smelting construction sites formed a grand chorus. From morning to night, endless streams of transport vehicles delivered car after car of ore to the iron smelting furnaces.

The Hongqi People's Commune is the largest commune in Jincheng County, with more than 10,000 households and more than 46,000 people, and is rich in coal and iron resources. It is a key base for iron smelting in the county. However, in mid-September, the daily output of pig iron only reached 25 tons. Starting from the 23rd, a mass native method iron smelting movement was launched throughout the commune, with the slogan "Break through a thousand tons to welcome National Day." In the past week, the entire commune has formed four combat armies for mining, transportation, furnace construction, and iron smelting, working hard day and night to build and restore more than 340 native square furnaces and native blast furnaces, and adopted the method of loading materials and smelting at the same time to quickly put them into production. On the 29th, the number of people involved in the iron smelting movement in the entire commune more than doubled that in mid-September. The number of various transport vehicles soared to more than 2,000. The commune party secretary, director, and other cadres personally went to the front line, taking the method of leaders contracting areas and cadres contracting furnaces to direct the battle. Every household also built small native furnaces, using wooden bellows to blow air, and smelted pig iron in a big way. The masses' small-scale iron smelting next to their homes produced more than 250 tons of iron alone. (Attached picture)

    人民公社办钢铁　人多势众热气高
    河北山西出了生铁千吨社
    武安午汲日产：1283吨　　高元红旗日产：1125吨
    武安城关日产：1005吨　　晋城红旗日产：1002吨
    本报讯　河北省武安、高元两县在全民办钢铁的群众运动中，都出现了人民公社日产生铁千吨的新纪录。
    武安县有两个日产千吨的社。全县人民在“学鲁山、超鲁山、力争钢铁元帅县”战斗口号的鼓舞下，全党全民总动员，向钢铁展开总体战。在9月29日，全县出铁四千四百五十三点八三吨。这一天，午汲人民公社经过昼夜鏖战，燃起土炉三千七百零三个，出铁一千二百八十三点六吨。城关人民公社全民奋战夺钢铁，29日日产铁一千零五吨。
    午汲人民公社在这次钢铁战斗中能够获得这样大的成绩，主要是成立人民公社后，全社实行了食堂化、托儿化、缝纫机械化，解放了一万四千二百多名妇女劳力，全县共动员了二万八千四百多名劳动力投入炼铁运动，使这次炼铁战斗中有了充足的人力。由于公社统一经营，充分利用了矿山资源，有铁矿山和没有矿山的村实行统一经营，建立了三个炼铁基地。另外，由于公社统一使用物力、财力，也解决了炼铁中缺乏物资的困难。尤其是公社化后，社员共产主义思想的增长，解决了物力、财力上的不少困难，如炼铁煤炭暂时供应不上，群众就自动献出煤炭一百八十万斤。由于公社统一调配劳力，采用了专业队与突击队相结合的办法，使采矿、运输、粉碎矿石、冶炼等都能按计划完成。
    午汲公社在炼铁中进行了技术革命，把“下焦寺式”土炉，由小改大，共改建了三千七百座土炉，其中有八座土炉每炉日产可达到一万斤至五万斤。经过改建的炉，比过去平均增产一倍以上，铁的质量也好。
    高元县红旗人民公社在9月29日十二时，也放射出日产铁一千一百多吨的大卫星。
    红旗人民公社能够放射这颗卫星，除了通过全社大辩论，战胜保守思想外，公社把劳力统一调配，统一指挥，全社工农商学兵齐发动，划分了钢铁、农业两条战线；九千多人突击农业生产，作为钢铁的后备军，一万五千多人直接投入钢铁第一线。这样，从9月23日就开始昼夜展开了建炉、装炉、运输、炼铁突击战。在建炉中，还创造了在地下挖窑的土焖炉，不用机器不用砖，三个劳动力一天就能建成一座，每座日产铁四至五吨，全社两天共建起这样的土焖炉六百座。在运输、采矿、技术等方面，经过鏖战也突破了难关，保证了土炉顺利出铁。在28日十二时有二百五十座炉子点火投入生产，到29日十二时，共产铁一千一百二十五点三吨。
    本报晋城3日电　山西省晋城县巴公乡红旗人民公社9月29日首创公社日产生铁一千零二吨的新纪录。
    29日这一天，全社有一半以上的人都卷入了采矿、运输、筑炉和炼铁的战斗。各个炼铁工地上的指挥广播声、马达声、欢笑声汇成了一个大合唱。从早到晚，川流不息的运输车辆把一车车的矿石送到了炼铁炉旁。
    红旗人民公社是晋城县最大的公社，拥有一万多户四万六千多人，煤铁资源丰富，是全县炼铁的重点基地。但在9月中旬，生铁日产量仅达到二十五吨。从23日开始，全社开展了群众性的土法炼铁运动，提出“突破千吨迎国庆”的口号。一周以来，全社组成了采矿、运输、建炉、炼铁的四支战斗大军，昼夜苦战，新建和恢复土方炉、土高炉三百四十多座，并采用边装料、边冶炼的办法迅速投入了生产。29日，全社卷入炼铁运动的人数超过9月中旬两倍多。各种运输车辆猛增到两千多辆。公社党委书记、主任等干部都亲临前线，采取领导包片、干部包炉的办法，指挥战斗。家家户户也都垒起了小土炉，用木风箱送风，大炼生铁。仅群众这种宅旁小型炼铁就出铁二百五十多吨。（附图片）
