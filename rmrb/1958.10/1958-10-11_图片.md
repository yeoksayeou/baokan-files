    The children of Zhao Village Complete Primary School in Lushan County, Henan Province, have formed a Young Pioneer Savings Bank. Zhang Xinmin (nine years old), a first-grade student, saved all the money his family gave him to buy candy. After a quick calculation, he has saved 92 cents in three weeks. How wonderful!

    河南鲁山县赵村完全小学的孩子们，组成了一个红领巾储蓄小银行。一年级学生张新民（九岁），把家里给他的买糖果钱，都存了起来。屈指一算，三个星期已经存了九角二分钱。真美气！	　新华社记者　唐茂林摄
