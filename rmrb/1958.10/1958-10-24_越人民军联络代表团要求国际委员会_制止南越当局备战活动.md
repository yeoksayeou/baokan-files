Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd. Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army, wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on the 21st, requesting the International Commission to stop the illegal act of the South Vietnamese authorities listing the bill "Declaring the Communist Party Illegal" on the agenda of the South Vietnamese "National Assembly" and to force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately abolish this illegal bill.

Ha Van Lau pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities' attempt to quickly pass the "Declaring the Communist Party Illegal" bill is aimed at intensifying war preparations in South Vietnam to cooperate with the United States' intensified conspiracy of aggression in the Far East and Southeast Asia.

Ha Van Lau said in the letter that while the United States has recently created tensions in the Taiwan Strait area, it has also further intensified its interference in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese authorities are even persecuting those who oppose the United States dragging South Vietnam onto the road of military adventure.

    越人民军联络代表团要求国际委员会
    制止南越当局备战活动
    新华社河内22日电　越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼在21日写信给越南国际委员会，要求国际委员会制止南越当局把“宣布共产党非法”的法案列入南越“国会”会议议程的非法行为，并且迫使南越当局立即取消这个非法的法案。
    何文楼指出，南越当局企图迅速通过“宣布共产党非法”法案的目的，是要加紧南越的备战活动，以配合美国在远东和东南亚地区加紧进行侵略活动的阴谋。
    何文楼在信中说，美国最近在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的同时，也进一步加紧对南越的干涉。而南越当局竟对那些反对美国把南越拉上军事冒险道路的人横加迫害。
