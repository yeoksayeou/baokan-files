Run Public Canteens Well

After the basic realization of communization throughout the country, what are the key issues facing the People's Communes now? They are the distribution problem; the problem of running collective welfare undertakings, especially running public canteens and nurseries well; and the problem of achieving organizational militarization, action battle readiness, and living collectivization. Among these three major issues, if public canteens and children's welfare undertakings are not run well, it will be impossible to consolidate living collectivization, to liberate women from housework, and the entire production will be affected. Running the collective welfare undertakings of the communes well, especially running public canteens well, has become a very important task in the current People's Commune movement, and a basic key to consolidating the People's Communes.

The People's Commune movement, which developed on the basis of the all-round Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the increasingly high communist ideological awareness of the broad masses of peasants, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, has basically achieved communization in the vast rural areas of the country in just one or two months. The fundamental task now is to further consolidate and develop the People's Commune system, and to use this "best organizational form for building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism" to make all socialist construction undertakings, especially industrial and agricultural production, leap forward on a larger scale and at a higher speed.

The all-round Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture requires more labor and higher labor productivity; it requires a high degree of organization and collectivization, and a greater development of the communist consciousness of the broad masses of the people. Running collective welfare undertakings, especially running public canteens, is the most effective measure to further liberate the labor force, especially the female labor force, and to increase the utilization rate and labor productivity of the labor force; it is also the basic key to realizing living collectivization, cultivating collective living habits and collectivist and communist ideological awareness among commune members, and consolidating the People's Communes. Precisely for this reason, with the all-round and continuous Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and with the progress of the People's Commune movement, public canteens have rapidly and universally developed in the vast rural areas of the country. According to preliminary statistics from nine provinces and cities in Northeast and North China, 1,074,000 public canteens have been established, and more than 80% of farm households have joined the canteens. Now this public canteen system is developing towards the cities along with the People's Commune movement. Before long, public canteens will surely be universally established in our cities and villages, becoming a new way of life for our people.

The view that regards public canteens as "trivial matters of life," thereby neglecting the leadership of canteen work, and even thinking that it is not worth spending "leadership's energy and time" on canteen work is wrong. Public canteens are not general living problems, but the living problems of 500 million peasants, and will soon become the living problems of the entire people. This is not a small matter, but a very, very big matter, a big matter for the whole people. Especially after the implementation of the grain supply system or food supply system where meals are free of charge, the public canteen problem has actually become one aspect of the distribution of the labor results of all commune members, and if it is not run well, it will affect the labor enthusiasm of commune members and the entire production of the commune. The reason why public canteens are not "trivial matters of life" is also that they play a very huge role in the great cause of liberating productive forces and building socialism and communism. Lenin once said: Only when we begin to universally transform trivial housework into socialist large-scale economy can there be genuine women's liberation, and genuine communism. The fact is exactly like this. After Henan Province realized public canteenization, each commune member can have three more hours a day to carry out labor or study, increasing labor productivity by about 30%, while liberating six million female laborers from heavy housework. Isn't it the most important political problem that such a huge labor force is liberated to participate in socialist construction?

The view that regards running public canteens well as a "simple and easy affair" is also incorrect. First, this matter is not simple. It is already not easy to be a good housewife and run the meals of a family well, making the whole family satisfied; it is even more a very complex task to run a canteen for hundreds or thousands of people. Second, public canteen work is by no means purely administrative work. Running public canteens and implementing collective dining is a major issue of changing the living habits of all farmers for thousands of years. In the early stage, the masses will feel inconvenienced and unaccustomed. If the canteen is not run well, the masses will have various ideological concerns and problems. Through public canteens, and also through meticulous political and ideological work, changing the living habits of the masses and cultivating the collectivist thinking of the masses, how can this be called "simple administrative work"? From this point of view, running public canteens well is not only an extremely important economic work, but also a very important political task. Every People's Commune should run public canteens well.

The main standard for running public canteens well should be that with the same amount of grain, oil, salt, vegetables, etc., commune members should eat more and better than when cooking separately, save grain and firewood; pay attention to hygiene, and make commune members feel convenient and satisfied. The food in the canteen should be diversified. Under possible conditions, try to achieve: the staple food should be a combination of coarse and fine grains, with dry and liquid foods; the dishes should be diverse, with vegetables and soup. In addition to supplying basic dishes, public canteens should, according to local living habits, try to provide free condiments such as soy sauce, vinegar, sauce, scallions, garlic, and chili. The canteen can also add a small store, preparing several kinds of better quality meat or vegetarian dishes every day for commune members to buy at their own expense. Public canteens should pay attention to improving meals. At present, generally speaking, we should strive to eat meat two or three times a month; and hold feasts during festivals. Public canteens should regularly strengthen the professional education of staff, advocate creation and invention, promote traditional excellent cooking techniques, create new local famous dishes, and achieve a hundred flowers blooming in the field of diet.

Public canteens should pay attention to hygiene. Tables and tableware should be scrubbed and disinfected after meals. The dining hall and kitchen should be cleaned regularly. Rice should be washed clean, rice should be cooked thoroughly, water should be boiled, food should be kept warm, and boiled water should be supplied in time, so as to avoid eating raw rice, cold rice, and drinking raw water. The tables and tableware of commune members suffering from infectious diseases should be washed, disinfected, and used separately.

Public canteens should have their own vegetable base, raise their own pigs, sheep, fish, and poultry; grind their own tofu, sprout bean sprouts, make sauces and vinegar, and pickle side dishes; where conditions permit, under the unified arrangement of the state, they can also brew their own wine for the canteen to improve meals. The production of vegetables, pigs, poultry, eggs, etc. in the People's Communes can be divided into two parts: one is the public canteen production part, mainly for their own consumption; the other is the professional team (farm) production part, mainly to complete the state procurement tasks, and after completing the state procurement tasks, the remainder is used to improve meals.

Public canteens should give appropriate care in diet to elderly commune members, children, patients, and mothers during lactation. If necessary, separate canteens can also be established. In People's Communes with ethnic minorities, the customs and habits of ethnic minorities should be respected, especially in places where Han and Hui people live together, separate canteens should be established for the Hui people.

It is now late autumn, and public canteens in various places should quickly use existing houses to rebuild dining halls, or build new simple dining halls as much as possible; the colder places in the north should especially solve this problem as soon as possible. In places where there is a habit of heating in winter, in order to reduce the difficulty of walking back and forth in the ice and snow and solve the heating problem, the scope of the canteen can be reduced to a few or a dozen neighboring households, and commune member families can be given firewood separately for heating; or grain, firewood, vegetables, etc. can be temporarily distributed to each household for cooking.

The size of public canteens is closely related to running public canteens well. If they are too small, they cannot fully exert the superiority of public canteens and play the role of liberating productive forces and cultivating commune members' collective living habits; if they are too large, they are not easy to manage, increasing the trouble of operation and commune members' meals. Under the current conditions, it is generally appropriate to establish public canteens with production teams (companies) or enterprises and institutions as units, and one canteen should be established for one unit. If the production team is large and the residence is relatively scattered, several canteens can also be established in one team. In areas where the residence is too scattered and it is not possible to change this scattered situation at present, public canteens can be temporarily suspended. Public canteens should adapt to the needs of production and improve their work in a timely manner. In order to carry out a certain production task, a large number of laborers are expeditioning, or camping in the fields, such as the current large number of steel troops going to the mountains to mine and refine iron, and a large number of deep plowing teams implementing "ten to the fields," and day and night deep plowing the land, public canteens should also go to the mountains, go to the fields, or establish temporary "mobile canteens" in a timely manner.

To run public canteens well, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership. The Party committees and branches below the county level should have a secretary or commune (team) leader responsible for leading the canteen work. At the same time, township and commune cadres should eat in the public canteen together with the commune members, and should no longer have their own separate canteens. In this way, they can better understand the canteen situation, care more about the canteen, and be able to help the canteen improve its work in a timely manner. The canteen should be equipped with cadres who are politically strong and have professional abilities to serve as administrators. The general staff and cooks of the canteen should be composed of commune members who are politically progressive, healthy, thrifty, and enthusiastic about canteen work. Commune members suffering from infectious diseases cannot work in the canteen. Commune members working in the canteen should receive the same wage remuneration as the same labor force participating in industrial and agricultural production. Skilled chefs should also be given certain technical subsidies.

The public canteen is a place that embodies "common labor and common consumption." To run the canteen well, all commune members must participate in the work and management of the canteen. A canteen management committee should be democratically elected, and meetings should be held regularly to study and improve the canteen work, and the accounts should be published regularly. A canteen convention should be formulated after discussion by commune members, and big-character posters should be fully used to solicit opinions from commune members and improve canteen management.

The most important condition for running public canteens well is that the Party committee is responsible, the secretary starts, and strengthens the Party's political and ideological work. In addition to regularly summarizing and exchanging experience in canteen work, commending advanced ones, promoting backward ones, and making canteen work continuously improved, and making the vast number of commune members feel convenient and satisfied, the county and commune Party committees should also regularly strengthen the collectivist and communist ideological education of commune members, cultivate commune members' collective living habits and improve commune members' political and ideological awareness. At the same time, all commune members should be educated to raise their political vigilance and prevent the destructive activities of bad elements.

    办好公共食堂
    全国基本实现公社化以后，人民公社当前的关键问题是什么呢？是分配问题；是办好集体福利事业特别是办好公共食堂、托儿所问题；是实现组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化问题。在这三大问题中，公共食堂和儿童福利事业这两件事情如果办不好，就不可能巩固生活集体化，不可能从家务劳动中把妇女解放出来，而使整个生产受到影响。办好公社的集体福利事业，特别是办好公共食堂，已经成为当前人民公社化运动中的一项十分重要的工作，成为巩固人民公社的一个基本关键。
    在农业生产全面大跃进和广大农民共产主义思想觉悟愈来愈高的基础上发展起来的人民公社化运动，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，只经过一、两个月的时间，就在全国广大农村基本实现了公社化。今后的根本任务是如何进一步巩固和发展人民公社制度，并运用这个“建成社会主义和逐步向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式”，使各项社会主义建设事业首先是工、农业生产以更大的规模更高的速度向前跃进。
    工、农业全面大跃进，要求有更多的劳动力和更高的劳动生产率；要求高度的组织化和集体化，要求广大人民的共产主义觉悟更大的发扬。举办集体福利事业，特别是举办公共食堂，正是进一步解放劳动力，特别是解放妇女劳动力，提高劳动力的利用率和劳动生产率的最有效的措施；也正是实现生活集体化，培养社员集体生活习惯和集体主义、共产主义思想觉悟，巩固人民公社的基本关键。正因为这个原故，便随着农业生产全面地不断地大跃进，随着人民公社化运动的进展，公共食堂在全国广大农村迅速普遍地发展起来。据东北、华北地区九个省市初步统计，已经建立起来的公共食堂有一百零七万四千个，80％以上的农户参加了食堂。现在这种公共食堂制度，正随着人民公社化运动向城市发展。时间不会太久，公共食堂定会在我国城市和乡村中普遍地建立起来，成为我国人民的新的生活方式。
    那种把公共食堂看成是“生活小事”，从而忽视对食堂工作的领导，甚至认为不值得在食堂工作上花费“领导的精力和时间”的观点是错误的。公共食堂不是一般的生活问题，而是五亿农民的生活问题，不久还会变成全国人民的生活问题。这不是小事情，而是很大很大的事情，是全民的大事情。特别是实行了吃饭不要钱的粮食供给制或伙食供给制以后，公共食堂问题，实际上已经成了全体社员劳动果实的分配问题的一个方面，办不好就会影响社员的劳动积极性和公社的整个生产。公共食堂之所以不是“生活小事”，还在于它在解放生产力和建设社会主义、共产主义的伟大事业中起着十分巨大的作用。列宁曾经说过：只有开始把琐碎的家务普遍改造成为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。事实正是这样，河南省实现公共食堂化以后，每个社员一天可以多出三个钟头的时间来进行劳动或学习。提高劳动生产率30％左右，同时使六百万个妇女劳动力从繁重的家务劳动解放出来。这样庞大的劳动力被解放出来参加社会主义建设事业，难道还不是最重要的政治问题吗？
    那种把办好公共食堂看成是一件“简单的轻而易举的事务工作”的观点，也是不对的。第一，这件事情不简单。当好一个家庭主妇，办好一家人的伙食，使全家吃得满意，已经不易；办好几百人几千人的食堂，更是一件十分复杂的工作。第二，公共食堂工作绝不是单纯的事务工作。举办公共食堂，实行集体吃饭，是改变全体农民的几千年来的生活习惯的大问题，在初期群众会感到不方便、不习惯，如果食堂再办的不好，群众就会产生这样那样的思想顾虑和问题。通过公共食堂，也通过细致的政治思想工作，改变群众的生活习惯，培养群众的集体主义的思想，这怎么能叫做“简单的事务工作”呢？由此看来，办好公共食堂，不仅是一件极其重要的经济工作，也是一项十分重大的政治任务。每个人民公社都应该把公共食堂办好。
    办好公共食堂的主要标准，应该是用同样数量的粮食、油盐和菜蔬等，要使社员比分散作饭时吃得饱，吃得好，节省粮食，柴炭；讲究卫生，使社员感到方便满意。食堂的饭菜要多样化。在可能的条件下，尽量作到：饭要粗细搭配、有干有稀；菜要多种多样，有菜有汤。公共食堂除供应基本菜以外，还应根据当地的生活习惯，尽量免费供给酱油、醋、酱、葱、蒜、辣椒等调味品。食堂内还可以增设小卖部，每天准备几种质量较好的晕菜或素菜，由社员自己出钱购买。公共食堂要注意改善伙食。在目前，一般地说，应当争取每月吃两、三次肉；每逢节日举行会餐。公共食堂要经常加强工作人员的业务教育，提倡创造发明，发扬传统的优秀烹调技术，创造新的地方名吃，在饮食领域内做到百花齐放。
    公共食堂要讲究卫生，餐桌、餐具在饭后都要擦洗、消毒，饭厅、厨房要经常打扫，米要淘净，饭要煮熟，水要煮开，饭菜要注意保暖，开水要及时供应，做到不吃生饭、冷饭，不喝生水。患传染病的社员的餐桌、餐具要分开擦洗，消毒和分开使用。
    公共食堂要有自己的蔬菜基地，要自己养猪、养羊、养鱼、养家禽；要自己磨豆腐，生豆芽，制酱制醋，腌制小菜等；有条件的地方，在国家的统一安排下，也可以自酿食堂用酒，以改善伙食。人民公社的蔬菜、生猪、家禽、蛋品等生产，可以分为两部分：一是公共食堂生产部分，主要是自己食用；一是专业队（场）生产部分，主要是完成国家收购任务，在完成国家收购任务以后，剩余的再用以改善伙食。
    公共食堂对年老社员、儿童、病员和哺乳期内的母亲，应当在饮食上给予适当照顾，必要时也可以单独建立食堂。在有少数民族的人民公社里，应该尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，特别是汉、回族杂居的地方，应该为回族建立单独的食堂。
    现在已临深秋，各地公共食堂应该赶快利用旧有房屋改建饭厅，或尽可能修建新的简易饭厅；北方较严冷的地方，尤应及早解决。冬天有取暖习惯的地方，到严寒的时候，为了减少在冰天雪地中往来走路的困难和解决取暖问题，可以把食堂的范围缩小至邻近的几户或十几户，社员家庭烧炕取暖另发烧柴；也可以暂时把粮食、柴炭、蔬菜等发给各户自己做饭。
    公共食堂规模的大小，对办好公共食堂有很大关系。太小了就不能充分发挥公共食堂的优越性，起不到解放生产力培养社员集体生活习惯的作用；太大了又不易管理，增加经营上和社员吃饭的麻烦。在目前条件下，一般应以生产队（连）或企业、事业组织为单位建立公共食堂为合适，一个单位建立一个食堂。如果生产队较大，居住比较分散，也可以一个队建立几个食堂。在居住过分分散的地区，目前又不能改变这种分散的情况时，公共食堂可以暂时缓办。公共食堂应该适应生产的需要，及时地改进自己的工作。为了突击某项生产任务，大批劳动力远征，或者实行田头扎营，如目前大批钢铁军上山开矿炼铁，大批深耕队伍实行“十到田”，日夜突击深翻地，公共食堂也应该上山、下田，或及时地建立临时性的“随营食堂”。
    办好公共食堂，必须加强组织领导。县以下的党委和支部，应有一个书记或社（队）长负责领导食堂工作。同时，乡、社干部应该和社员一起在公共食堂吃饭，而不应再有自己单独的食堂。这样他们更能了解食堂情况，更关心食堂，更能够及时地帮助食堂改进工作。食堂要配备政治坚强、有业务能力的干部担任管理员。食堂的一般工作人员和炊事员，应该由政治进步、身体健康、克勤克俭并热心食堂工作的社员担任。患传染病的社员不能担任食堂工作。在食堂工作的社员，要和参加工农业生产的同等劳动力得到相同的工资报酬。有技术的厨师，还应当给予一定的技术补贴。
    公共食堂是体现“共同劳动、共同消费”的场所，要办好食堂，必须全体社员参预食堂的工作和管理。要民主选出食堂的管理委员会，并定期开会研究改进食堂工作，定期公布账目，要经过社员讨论制定食堂公约，并充分运用大字报经常征求社员意见，改进食堂管理。
    办好公共食堂的最重要的条件是党委负责，书记动手，加强党的政治思想工作。县和公社的党委除经常总结交流食堂工作经验，表扬先进，推动落后，使食堂工作不断改进，使广大社员都感到方便满意外，还要经常加强社员的集体主义和共产主义思想教育，培养社员的集体生活习惯和提高社员政治思想觉悟。同时，还要教育全体社员提高政治警惕，防止坏分子的破坏活动。
