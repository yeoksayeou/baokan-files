    To Guarantee a Good Life for the Labor Force
    Eleven Youths in Xingtai Pledge to Be Shock Troops in Collective Welfare Undertakings and Propose a Competition Initiative to Young Comrades Across the Country
    (According to the China Youth Daily) Eleven young cooks, childcare workers, seamstresses, rice and flour processing workers, and salespersons from seven people's communes in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, recently enthusiastically proposed a friendly competition initiative to young people working in collective welfare undertakings across the country, aiming to be shock troops in the collective welfare undertakings of the communes, ensuring that the labor force eats well and lives well every day.
    This initiative was proposed at a forum held by the Xingtai County Communist Youth League Committee on the 23rd. These young people are filled with a sense of honor and pride in engaging in public service labor in the communes, and their speeches sparkled with the light of communist ideology. Zhao Yongqin, a young cook and female member of the Communist Youth League at the Iron and Steel Restaurant, said: "I feel it is an honor to be a cook. Some people look down on this profession, saying that cooking and serving dishes in the public canteen is 'serving people.' That's an old way of thinking; they don't understand the importance of our work. As the saying goes, people are iron, and food is steel; you'll be hungry if you miss a meal. No one can do without eating. Besides, my work in the canteen is different from cooking at home. Now it's not for a small family, but for serving the big family of the commune." Cui Xiangqin, a young childcare worker and female member of the Communist Youth League from the Gaimei Commune, said: "Some people think there's no future in being a childcare worker, and I disagree with that view. In my opinion, this work is the most important and the most glorious. Because doing this work well not only allows thousands of mothers to focus on production with peace of mind, but also cultivates outstanding future generations for the motherland. Children live a collective life from an early age, cultivating their love for the country, the commune, labor, health, and public property. When they grow up, they will definitely become communist talents. Otherwise, bad habits in childhood will affect them when they grow up." Wang Yanjie, a rice and flour processing worker, also spoke at the meeting: "The work of milling flour is very important. If the flour is milled coarsely or slowly, the commune members won't eat well, which will not only affect production but also affect their trust in the commune. Whether our work is done well or not has a great relationship with the consolidation of the commune." Young cooks Zhao Yongqin and Lu Fengxiu also proposed that in future canteen work, they should not be picky or choosy, but strive to make a variety of dishes, process coarse grains finely, and process fine grains skillfully, ensuring that commune members eat better and more fully than they do at home. In addition, they should not only be good cooks but also good breeders of pigs and chickens; they should not only be able to cook but also learn to grow vegetables, making themselves versatile. Tang Lan'ying, Cui Xiangqin, Fan Xiang'e, Hu Yujing, Huo Rongfang, and other five young childcare workers proposed to dedicate themselves to the great cause of nurturing the future generations of the motherland, working in nurseries and kindergartens without conditions or compensation, maintaining good contact with parents, and cultivating children with good character and good health, ensuring that children grow even better than they do with their mothers.
    At the meeting, the young people also exchanged work experiences. Finally, with a hundredfold ambition, they proposed to young people working in collective welfare undertakings in people's communes across the country to launch a friendly competition.
    The action slogan they proposed in the initiative is: Wherever the Party points, we will rush there; whatever the Party needs us to do, we will do; resolutely be shock troops in the collective welfare undertakings of the communes, ensuring that the labor force eats well and lives well every day!
    Their competition conditions are:
    1. Raise communist consciousness, promote the communist spirit of "one for all, all for one," establish a communist labor attitude, work without conditions or compensation, not be picky or choosy, take the lead in enduring hardship, and rush to do the most difficult work.
    2. Play a model role in the collective welfare undertakings of the commune.
    Childcare workers should maintain good contact with parents, raise children well, carry out communist moral education well, and ensure that children in nurseries and kindergartens grow better than they do with their mothers.
    Cooks should process coarse grains finely, process fine grains skillfully, make a variety of dishes, serve food as soon as people arrive, and ensure that commune members eat better and more fully than they do at home; not only be good cooks but also good breeders; not only be able to cook but also be able to grow vegetables and make pickles.
    Grain processing workers should maintain machines well, avoid accidents, produce fine rice and flour, produce more rice and flour, and grind sweet potatoes into flour, so that the canteen can process coarse grains finely and ensure that the canteen's supply of rice and flour is met.
    Seamstresses should make clothing with good styles, save on fabric, sew seams firmly, and take on work early, ensuring that clothing needed by commune members for the season and production is made in a timely manner.
    Salespersons should ensure that commodities are complete, sell goods not passively waiting in the store but deliver goods to construction sites, canteens, villages, and households; receive commune members with enthusiasm, courtesy, and civility, ensuring that commune members are satisfied in five ways (satisfied when they come, satisfied when they leave, satisfied when they buy, satisfied when they use, and satisfied whenever they think about it).
    3. Promote the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, use both hands and brains in work, continuously learn and create advanced experiences, and carry out technical innovation activities.
    The eleven young people who proposed the initiative are: Guo Jinrun, Wang Derong, Hu Yujing, Fan Xiang'e, Huo Rongfang, Cui Xiangqin, Wang Yanjie, Lu Fengxiu, Zhao Yongqin, Li Guangjin, and Tang Lan'ying. (The picture below shows the eleven young people who proposed the initiative.)

    保证劳动大军生活得好
    邢台十一名青年立志当好集体福利事业的
    突击手并向全国青年战友提出竞赛倡议
    据中国青年报消息　河北省邢台县七个人民公社的十一名青年炊事员、保育员、缝纫员、米面加工员和售货员，最近热情洋溢地向全国站在集体福利事业工作岗位上的青年们提出友谊竞赛的倡议，要当好公社集体福利事业的突击手，让劳动大军天天吃得好，生活得好。
    这个倡议是在共青团邢台县委23日召开的一次座谈会上提出的。这些青年人对从事公社服务性劳动满怀光荣感和自豪感，他们的发言闪烁着共产主义思想的光芒。钢铁饭店青年炊事员、女共青团员赵永芹说：“我当炊事员感到是件光荣的事，有人瞧不起这行，说在公共食堂里作饭菜、端盘子是‘侍候人’的工作。那是脑子旧，不了解我们工作的重要。俗话说，人是铁，饭是钢，一顿不吃饿的慌。谁不吃饭也不成。再说，我在食堂干活和在家里作饭不同，现在不是为小家，是为公社的大家服务。”盖美公社的青年保育员、女共青团员崔香琴说：“有人认为当保育员没出息，我反对这种看法。按我的看法，干这工作最重要，也最光荣。因为把这个工作作好了，不仅能使千百个妈妈安心一意地搞生产，而且可以为祖国培养优秀的后一代。孩子们从小就过集体生活，培养他爱国、爱社、爱劳动、爱身体、爱护公物，他长大肯定会成为共产主义的人材。不然，小时候有坏习惯，长大了也受影响。”米面加工员王延杰也在会上发言说：“磨面的工作非常重要，面磨的粗，磨的慢，社员们吃不好，不仅会影响生产，还会影响他们对公社的信任，咱们的工作搞得好不好和公社能不能巩固有很大的关系。”青年炊事员赵永芹、路凤秀还提出今后要在食堂工作中，不挑肥，不拣瘦，作到饭菜花样多，粗粮细作，细粮巧作，保证让社员们比在家里吃得饱，吃得好；另外，不但要当好炊事员，还要当好养猪、养鸡的饲养员；不但能做菜，还要学会种菜，使自己成为一个多面手。唐兰英、崔香琴、范香娥、胡玉景、霍荣芳等五名青年保育员提出要献身于培育祖国后一代的伟大事业，在托儿所和幼儿园里工作不讲条件，不计报酬，作到和家长联系好，培养小孩品德好，身体好，保证让小孩比在妈妈跟前长得还好。
    这次座谈会上，青年们还交流了工作经验。最后以百倍的雄心向全国各地人民公社集体福利事业工作岗位上的青年，提出了开展友谊竞赛的倡议。
    他们在倡议书中提出的行动口号是：党指向哪里就奔向哪里，党需要干什么就干什么；坚决当好公社集体福利事业的突击手，让劳动大军天天吃得好，生活得好！
    他们的竞赛条件是：
    一、提高共产主义觉悟，发扬“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义精神，树立共产主义的劳动态度，工作不讲条件，不计报酬，不挑肥拣瘦，吃苦在前，抢干最艰巨的工作。
    二、在公社集体福利事业中发挥模范作用。
    保育员作到和家长联系好，对小孩抚育得好，共产主义品德教育进行得好，保证孩子在托儿所、幼儿园比在妈妈跟前长得好。
    炊事员作到粗粮细作，细粮巧作，饭菜花样多，随到随吃，保证让社员们比在家里吃得饱、吃得好；不但当好炊事员，而且当好饲养员；不但会作菜，而且能够种菜、做酱菜。
    粮食加工员作到保养机器好，不出事故，出的米面细，出的米面多，并用白薯磨成面，使食堂能够粗粮细作，保证满足食堂米面的供应。
    缝纫员做到服装式样好，节约用布料，针线轧的牢，取活日子早，保证及时作出社员季节和生产需用的衣服。
    售货员做到商品齐全，卖货不坐等门市，把货送到工地、食堂，送到村、到户；热情、文明礼貌地接待社员，保证做到社员五满意
  （来时满意、走时满意、买时满意、用时满意、啥时想起来啥时满意）。
    三、发扬敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，在工作中动手又动脑，不断学习和创造先进经验，开展技术革新活动。
