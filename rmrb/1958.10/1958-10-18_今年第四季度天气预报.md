Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Today, this reporter obtained the general weather conditions for the country for the three months of October, November, and December from the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This was calculated by the institute before National Day.

Weather forecasts are very beneficial for industrial and agricultural production, field surveys and exploration, travel, and people's lives. In the past, we could only predict the weather for the next day or a few days. Now we can forecast the weather for three months. This is a major achievement in our country's scientific research.

According to the calculations of the Institute of Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences: In the first half of October this year, there will be two or three small cold air intrusions into Northwest and Northern China, so Northern China will be slightly colder than normal during this period. Starting in the second half of October, China will warm up for about a week, until the end of October and the beginning of November, when temperatures will drop again.

In November, there will be one or two relatively strong cold air outbreaks moving south into China, around mid-November and late November, one of which may reach the level of a cold wave. Throughout November, most areas of Northern China will be one to two degrees Celsius lower than the normal temperature (historical average temperature) (monthly average), while the Southwest and Southeast will be one to three degrees Celsius higher than the normal temperature.

In early and mid-December, China will experience warmer weather, but there will be two cold air outbreaks in the later part of early December and late December, one of which (around late December) will reach the level of a cold wave. Temperatures will generally be low nationwide in December, with some areas being three to four degrees Celsius lower than the normal temperature (monthly average). Rainfall in October will generally be less than normal, with more rainfall in the Yangtze River basin. The Yangtze River area will have more than ten rainy days, the Southwest region more than fifteen days, Southern Sichuan and Guizhou more than twenty days, and areas north of the Huai River will have less than five days. Rainfall in the Yellow River basin will be higher than normal in November, while rainfall in the Jiangnan region will be lower. There may be five or six or more rainy days in the north, and more than ten days between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, with some areas reaching twenty days. Rainfall will generally be higher than normal nationwide in December, except for the Jianghuai area, where it will be less.

    今年第四季度天气预报
    新华社17日讯　今天，本社记者从中国科学院地球物理研究所获得了今年10、11、12三个月中全国天气的大致情况。这是这个研究所在国庆前夕推算出来的。
    天气预报对于工农业生产、野外调查勘察、旅行和人们生活都有很大好处。过去我们只能预知第二天或者几天以内的天气情况，现在能够预报三个月的天气。这是我国科学研究上的一项重大成就。
    根据中国科学院地球物理研究所的推算：今年10月上半月，有两、三次小股冷空气侵入我国西北及北方，所以这期间我国北部比正常情况稍冷。10月下半月开始，我国将回暖一星期左右，直到10月末及11月初，温度又将再次下降。
    11月将有一、二次比较强烈的冷空气南下进入我国，时间约在11月中及11月末，其中一次可达寒潮程度。整个11月我国北方大部分地区将比正常温度（历年来的平均温度）低摄氏一度到二度（全月平均），西南及东南部将比正常温度高摄氏一度到三度。
    12月初及中旬，我国将出现回暖天气，但在初旬后期及下旬将有两次冷空气爆发，其中一次（约在下旬）将达到寒潮程度。全国范围内12月份温度一般较低，个别地区将比正常温度低三度到四度（全月平均）。10月份雨量一般偏少，长江流域偏多，长江区下雨天在十天以上，西南地区在十五天以上，四川南部及贵州在二十天以上，淮河以北都在五天以下。11月雨量黄河流域偏多，江南偏少。北方下雨天可能有五天或六天以上，长江淮河间可达十天以上，个别地区可达二十天。12月雨量除江淮地区较少外，全国一般偏多。
