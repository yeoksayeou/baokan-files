Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry issued regulations on calculating pig iron production on the 23rd. The regulations state:

    I. Sintered iron (or other iron with similar properties under other names) should generally not be counted as pig iron production;

    II. Sintered iron that has been directly consumed as a steelmaking raw material can be converted into pig iron production (for ease of calculation, it can be converted at a rate of 1.2 tons of pig iron per ton of steel produced. For example, if two tons of sintered iron are used to make one ton of steel, in addition to calculating the steel production, 1.2 tons of pig iron production should also be calculated). However, sintered iron that has not been made into steel should not be converted into pig iron production;

    III. Scrap steel (or scrap pot iron) used for steelmaking should not be counted as pig iron production, regardless of whether it is used as a steelmaking raw material or not. If both scrap steel and sintered iron are used for steelmaking, only the sintered iron should be converted.

    怎样计算生铁产量
    冶金部作出规定
    据新华社24日讯　冶金工业部23日发出关于计算生铁产量的规定。规定说：
    一、烧结铁
  （或类似烧结铁性质的其他名称的铁）一般不应作为生铁产量；
    二、作为炼钢原料已直接消耗的烧结铁，可以折算为生铁的产量（为了计算方便，可按生产一吨钢折算为一点二吨生铁。例如，用二吨烧结铁炼出了一吨钢，除计算钢产量外，同时计算一点二吨生铁的产量）但未炼成钢的烧结铁不应折算为生铁产量；
    三、炼钢用的废钢铁（或废锅铁）不论作为炼钢原料与否，均不应算生铁的产量；若同时用废钢铁与烧结铁炼钢，则只折算烧结铁。
