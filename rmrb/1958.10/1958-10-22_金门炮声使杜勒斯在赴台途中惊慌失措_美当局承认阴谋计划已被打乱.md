Xinhua News Agency, 21st – The US authorities were quite flustered after China's Ministry of National Defense ordered the resumption of punitive shelling of the Kinmen Chiang troops on the afternoon of the 20th, admitting that their plan had been disrupted.

According to Western news agencies, after the announcement of the resumption of shelling by the Chinese people, US Secretary of State Dulles, who was en route to Taipei and had arrived in Alaska, immediately called President Eisenhower from Fairbanks, Alaska at 5:30 AM US time (5:30 PM Chinese time on the 20th), waking him from his sleep to discuss the matter for ten minutes. At the same time, numerous long-distance telephone discussions took place between the US State Department and Dulles, between the State Department and Eisenhower, and between Dulles and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, who had just arrived in Taipei. After these discussions, Eisenhower finally decided to instruct Dulles to continue to Taipei. Subsequently, Dulles and Eisenhower's Press Secretary Hagerty issued statements on the matter.

Dulles' statement said that due to the resumption of shelling of the Kinmen Chiang troops by the Chinese people, the meeting scheduled to take place between him and the Chiang Kai-shek group "cannot have the scope and nature that it might have had under a ceasefire." He added, "Nevertheless, I believe it is useful to hold consultations." Here, Dulles admitted in a helpless tone that his original conspiracy plan in the US-Chiang talks had been disrupted.

Both Dulles and Hagerty expressed hope in their statements that the resumption of shelling "will be brief." This shows that the United States is still trying to play its bankrupt trick of demanding that China implement a "long-term ceasefire."

United Press International, Denver, 20th: "The resumption of the Kinmen bombardment has shattered the President's plan: to continue to point out with pride in his current (congressional election) speaking tour that there is currently no shooting, partly due to his government's foreign policy." The report said that a campaign speech that Eisenhower was scheduled to deliver in Los Angeles on the evening of the 20th had to be "rewritten." When asked about this matter, Hagerty had to admit that Eisenhower and his advisors needed to re-"study" the draft of the speech.

    金门炮声使杜勒斯在赴台途中惊慌失措
    美当局承认阴谋计划已被打乱
    新华社21日讯　在中国国防部20日下午下令恢复对金门蒋军的惩罚性炮击以后，美国当局颇为慌张，承认他们的计划被打乱了。
    据西方通讯社报道，在中国恢复炮击的消息宣布以后，正在乘飞机前往台北途中到达阿拉斯加的美国国务卿杜勒斯，立即在美国时间清晨五时三十分（中国时间20日下午五时三十分）从阿拉斯加州费尔班克斯打电话给正在美国西部科罗拉多州丹佛准备前往西海岸作竞选旅行的总统艾森豪威尔，把他从睡梦中叫醒来商谈了十分钟。同时，美国国务院和杜勒斯之间，国务院和艾森豪威尔之间，杜勒斯和刚刚到达台北的助理国务卿罗伯逊之间，进行了多次的长途电话商谈。经过这些商谈，艾森豪威尔最后决定指示杜勒斯继续前往台北。随后杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的新闻秘书哈格蒂分别就这件事发表了声明。
    杜勒斯的声明说，由于中国人民恢复对金门蒋军的炮击，预定即将举行的他和蒋介石集团之间的会谈“不可能具有在停火情况下本来可能具有的那种范围和性质”。他又说，“尽管这样，我相信举行磋商会是有益的”。杜勒斯在这里以无可奈何的腔调承认：他在美蒋会谈中的原阴谋计划被打乱了。
    杜勒斯和哈格蒂都在声明中表示希望恢复炮击“将是短暂的”。这表明美国仍妄图玩弄它的早已破产了的要中国实行“长期停火”的诡计。
    合众国际社20日丹佛消息说：“对金门炮轰的恢复粉碎了总统的计划：在他目前的（国会竞选）演说旅行中继续以自豪的心情指出，目前没有进行射击，这一部分是由于他的政府的外交政策。”消息说，就在20日这一天晚间预定要在洛杉矶发表的艾森豪威尔的一篇竞选演说就必须加以“改写”。在记者问到这件事的时候，哈格蒂不得不承认，艾森豪威尔和他的顾问需要重新“研究一下”这篇演说的稿本。
