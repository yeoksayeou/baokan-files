Xinhua News Agency, October 17th, Tokyo dispatch: The "Akahata" published an editorial today condemning Nobusuke Kishi's remarks to American reporters, and calling on the Japanese people nationwide to recognize the conspiracy of the United States and the Kishi cabinet from Kishi's remarks, muster courage and firm confidence, and launch a nationwide unified action to struggle against them.

The "Akahata" pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi is displaying the skills of a militarist warmonger and exposing his face as a traitorous politician, rare in the world, and anti-national.

The editorial pointed out that Kishi actually told his inner thoughts to American reporters before letting the Japanese people know, so the Japanese people were greatly surprised when they heard the news.

The editorial pointed out that successive Japanese prime ministers after the war have been accustomed to lying to the people, but no one has surpassed Nobusuke Kishi.

The newspaper strongly condemned Kishi's statement that "the time has come to delete the clauses renouncing war from the constitution." The newspaper believes that these words not only show that he wants to obliterate the basic spirit of the constitution, but also mean that he wants to promote the revival of militarism and war preparations.

The editorial strongly condemned Kishi for slandering China's just cause of liberating its own territory of Kinmen, Matsu, and Taiwan as "aggression" and other anti-communist remarks.

The newspaper pointed out that Kishi tells the Japanese people that he wants to change the unequal Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" into an "equal treaty," but in reality, his intention is to assist the United States in its aggression against China, establish a militarist aggressive war system, and actively participate in this aggression as soon as the opportunity arises.

The newspaper exposed that Kishi's purpose in revising the "Police Duties Execution Law," the "Security Treaty," and the constitution is to follow the United States, pave the way for Japan to move towards militarism, and promote Japan to embark on the road to war against China again.

The editorial pointed out, however, that this road is impassable, and it can only bring destruction to Japan.

The editorial pointed out that imperialists and militarists appear strong on the surface, but in fact, they are paper tigers. Currently, the socialist forces are dominant, the national liberation movement and the international workers' movement are unprecedentedly high, this is an era of the declining imperialist forces, and the current situation in Japan represents the most contradictory link in this world situation.

    不许岸信介在日本复活军国主义
    日本“赤旗报”号召全国人民统一行动展开斗争
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”今天发表社论，谴责岸信介对美国记者发表的谈话，并且号召日本全国人民从岸信介的谈话认清美国和岸信介内阁的阴谋，鼓起勇气和坚定信心，以全国性的统一行动来对它们展开斗争。
    “赤旗报”指出，岸信介在发挥军国主义好战者的本领，并且把他的世界上罕有的反民族的卖国政客的面目暴露了出来。
    社论指出，岸信介在让日本人民知道以前，竟先把他的内心告诉了美国记者，因此日本人民当听到这项消息时大吃一惊。
    社论指出，战后日本历任首相都惯于对人民说谎，但是没有任何人超过岸信介。
    报纸强烈谴责岸信介关于“从宪法里删去放弃战争的条款的时候已经到来”这一说法。报纸认为，这番话不仅表明他是想抹煞宪法的基本精神，而且还意味着他要推进军国主义的复活和战争准备。
    社论强烈谴责岸信介把中国解放自己的领土金门、马祖和台湾的正义事业诬蔑为“侵略”和其它反共言论。
    报纸指出，岸信介在日本人民面前说要把不平等的日美“安全条约”改为“平等条约”，但是实际上，他的本心是要协助美国对中国的侵略，建立军国主义侵略战争体系，并且一俟时机到来，就要积极参加这种侵略。
    报纸揭露岸信介修改“警察官职务执行法”、“安全条约”和宪法的目的在于追随美国，为日本走向军国主义铺平道路，促使日本重新走上以中国为对象的战争道路。
    社论指出，但是，这条道路是走不通的，这只能给日本带来灭亡。
    社论指出，帝国主义者和军国主义者表面上看起来好像强大，但其实它却是纸老虎。目前是在社会主义力量占优势、民族解放运动和国际工人运动空前高涨的形势中，这是帝国主义势力日益衰退的时代，日本目前的局势代表着这种世界形势的最富有矛盾的一个环节。
