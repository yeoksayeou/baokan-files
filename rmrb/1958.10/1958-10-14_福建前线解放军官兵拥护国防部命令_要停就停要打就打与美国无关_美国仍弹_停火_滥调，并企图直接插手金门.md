Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, 13th -- Today, the Fujian Frontline has entered its eighth day without the sound of cannons. After a seven-day pause in the shelling of Kinmen, the People's Liberation Army on the frontline is strictly implementing the Ministry of National Defense's order to suspend the shelling of Kinmen for another two weeks.

	Today, Chiang's transport ships continue to deliver supplies to Kinmen. Chiang's troops on Kinmen and other islands also continue to move freely on the ground.

	While suspending the shelling, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the frontline held report meetings and symposiums to study the order issued by the Ministry of National Defense. They unanimously expressed their warm support. Lieutenant Zhu Jian, the company commander of a coastal artillery company, said that Minister Peng's order once again fully demonstrates our humanitarianism and national righteousness. However, our suspension of the shelling of Kinmen is completely different from the ceasefire conspiracy played by the United States. We have no fire to cease with the United States. Our extension of the suspension of the shelling of Kinmen is to give the Chiang Kai-shek clique more opportunities for repentance and has nothing to do with the United States. Zhao Liqi, a torpedo soldier of a naval speedboat unit who won a second-class merit in the naval battle, said that the series of victories in the past shelling of Kinmen and the fact that we have suspended the shelling twice fully prove that the initiative is completely in our hands. We will stop if we want to, and we will fight if we want to. This is for the benefit of the 650 million Chinese people, including Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The United States is not allowed to escort Chiang's troops in the Kinmen waters. If there is an escort, we will open fire immediately.

	During these eight days of suspended shelling, the officers and soldiers of the three armed services on the frontline remained on high alert, ready to counterattack any provocative enemies. At the same time, the officers and soldiers actively summarized their combat experience and continuously improved their combat skills.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- New York Dispatch: After the Chinese Ministry of National Defense ordered the shelling of Kinmen to be suspended for another two weeks early this morning, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, who is in New York, immediately spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles in Washington and issued a statement through his press secretary, Hagerty, saying: "The President and Secretary of State agree that this is good news, as the extension of the ceasefire gives the U.S. government further opportunities to negotiate a solution to the problem in that area." Hagerty's statement clearly continues to deliberately confuse China's suspension of the shelling of Kinmen, which is purely an internal affair, with the U.S.'s "ceasefire" demand to interfere in China's internal affairs. When a reporter asked Hagerty whether the negotiations mentioned by the U.S. government referred to negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of China or with the Kuomintang in Taiwan, Hagerty explained that "all-inclusive negotiations" should be conducted.

	Meanwhile, U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Green (Democrat), in a statement issued just after discussing U.S. Taiwan policy with Dulles, said he was "pleased" to hear the news of China's extension of the ceasefire. Green had recently expressed dissatisfaction and concern about the U.S. government's policy in the Taiwan Strait, but in this statement, he also said he "hopes" that China will "continue to maintain the ceasefire" and opposes the so-called "disruption of the ceasefire."

	U.S. Democratic Senator Mansfield said in a statement in Washington that China's extension of the ceasefire period "is an encouraging sign." Mansfield also said: "We (the United States) should take advantage of this temporary easing of the situation on the coastal islands to see if arrangements can be made for peace and stability in that area on a reasonable and mutually acceptable basis. Now is the time to do so."

Xinhua News Agency, 13th -- Taipei Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy arrived in Taipei on the 12th. He will hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek authorities and inspect U.S. military bases scattered throughout Taiwan, which are directly aimed at the Chinese mainland, during his three-day "visit."

	Upon arrival at the airport, McElroy made a statement to reporters, reiterating that the U.S. government will continue to pursue its policy of aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs. He made unwarranted comments on China's decision to suspend the shelling of Kinmen, a purely internal affair, saying that he hoped China's decision foreshadowed "a permanent cessation of armed attacks."

	McElroy shamelessly threatened that if China resumes shelling Kinmen, the U.S. government will resume escorting Chiang's troops. He said, "If it is militarily necessary, and if the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang gang) cannot handle this task alone, we will participate in this effort again."

	McElroy's remarks also showed that the U.S. invading forces will continue to赖 (lai - rely on, hang around) in the Taiwan Strait region. On the one hand, he hypocritically said that he hoped the tension would ease, "so that the U.S. forces in the Formosa (Taiwan) region can be reduced." But then he contradicted himself and said, "At present, we do not intend to withdraw." He said that "until Communist China's attitude is clear," "U.S. troops will not withdraw." He even said that if China resumes shelling or takes other actions, the U.S. will consider increasing its forces in the Taiwan Strait region.

	McElroy also threatened that the U.S. armed forces in the Taiwan region have "strong forces" and can carry out the "obligations" undertaken by the U.S. in accordance with the military treaty signed with the Chiang gang.

	It is reported that at a time when the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the United States are in a state of "tense relations," McElroy's "visit" to Taipei this time is to "boost morale" and "persuade" Chiang Kai-shek. Under the guise of "boosting morale" for Chiang Kai-shek, the United States is installing more bases and troops in Taiwan, strengthening its own direct military control over Taiwan. At the same time, sources revealed that McElroy's trip is also to "persuade" Chiang Kai-shek to reduce the number of troops stationed on the Chinese coastal islands, and according to Agence France-Presse, the "compensation" for reducing troops is that the United States will transport its new tactical weapons to these islands. This shows that the United States is attempting to directly intervene in Kinmen, expanding its armed control to China's mainland inland islands.

### 福建前线解放军官兵拥护国防部命令  要停就停要打就打与美国无关  美国仍弹“停火”滥调，并企图直接插手金门

    福建前线解放军官兵拥护国防部命令
    要停就停要打就打与美国无关
    美国仍弹“停火”滥调，并企图直接插手金门
    新华社福建前线13日电　今天，福建前线已进入了没有炮声的第八天。前线人民解放军在暂停对金门炮击的七天以后，又严格地执行着国防部关于对金门炮击再停两个星期的命令。
    今天，蒋军运输舰艇继续向金门运送着补给物资。金门等岛上的蒋军也继续在地面上自由的活动。
    前线人民解放军官兵在暂停炮击的同时，纷纷举行报告会和座谈会，学习国防部发布的命令，他们一致表示热烈的拥护。海岸炮兵某连连长朱尖中尉说，彭部长的命令，再一次充分地表示了我们的人道主义和民族大义；但是我们暂停对金门的炮击，与美国所玩弄的停火阴谋完全是两回事，我们与美国无火可停。我们延长暂停炮击金门的期限，是给蒋介石集团更多的侮悟机会，与美国毫无关系。曾经在海战中荣立二等功的海军快艇某部雷击兵赵礼锜说，过去炮击金门的一连串胜利，和我们两次暂停炮击的事实，充分证明了主动权完全掌握在我们手中。我们要停就停，要打就打。这是为了包括台、澎、金、马在内的六亿五千万中国人民的利益。不允许美国在金门海域为蒋军护航。如有护航，我们就立即开炮。
    在这暂停炮击的八天里，前线三军官兵严阵以待，准备随时反击挑衅的敌人。同时，官兵们积极地总结战斗经验，不断地提高着战斗本领。
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：在中国国防部今天凌晨下令对金门炮击再停两星期以后，正在纽约的美国总统艾森豪威尔立即同在华盛顿的美国国务卿杜勒斯通电话交谈了这件事，并且通过他的新闻秘书哈格蒂发表声明说：“总统和国务卿一致认为这是好消息，由于停火延长，美国政府得到进一步的机会来通过谈判拟定解决那个地区的那个问题的办法。”哈格蒂的声明显然是继续把中国暂停炮击金门这种纯属内政的行动故意同美国干涉中国内政的“停火”要求混为一谈。有记者问哈格蒂，美国政府所说的谈判究竟是指同中华人民共和国政府还是同台湾国民党人的谈判，哈格蒂解释说，要进行“包括一切方面的谈判”。
    同时，美国参议院外交委员会主席格林（民主党）在刚刚同杜勒斯讨论了美国的台湾政策以后发表的声明里说，他“高兴地”听到中国延长停止炮击期限的消息。格林最近曾经对美国政府在台湾海峡地区奉行的政策表示不满和担心，但是，他在这个声明里又说，他“希望”中国“继续保持停火”，并且表示反对所谓“破坏停火”。
    美国民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德在华盛顿发表谈话说，中国延长停止炮击期限“是一个令人鼓舞的迹象”。曼斯菲尔德又说：“我们（美国）应当利用沿海岛屿局势的这种暂时缓和来看看是不是可以在一个合理的和双方都能接受的基础上为那个地区的和平和稳定作出安排，现在正是这样做的时候了。”
    新华社13日讯　台北消息：美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊12日抵达台北。他将同蒋介石当局举行会谈，并且在为期三天的“访问”中视察美国散布在台湾各地的矛头直接指向中国大陆的军事基地。
    麦克耳罗伊抵达时在机场上对记者发表谈话，再次表明美国政府将继续推行侵略中国和干涉中国内政的政策。他对中国暂停炮轰金门这一纯属中国内政的决定妄加评论，说什么他希望中国的决定预示着“武装攻击的永久停止。”
    麦克耳罗伊无耻地要挟说，如果中国重新炮击金门，美国政府将要恢复为蒋军护航。他说，“如果在军事上是必要的，如果中华民国（指蒋帮）不能单独应付这个任务，我们将再次参加这种努力。”
    麦克耳罗伊的谈话还表明，美国侵略军队将继续死赖在台湾海峡地区。他一方面假惺惺地说，他希望紧张局势缓和，“使美国在福摩萨（台湾）地区的部队可以减少”。但是他接着又自打嘴巴说，“在目前我们不打算撤退”。他说，在“共产党中国的态度表明以前”，“美国军队不会撤退”。他甚至表示，如果中国恢复炮轰或者采取其他行动，美国将考虑增加在台湾海峡地区的部队。
    麦克耳罗伊还恫吓说，美国在台湾地区的武装部队有“强大的力量”，可以按照同蒋帮签订的军事条约来执行美国承担的“义务”。
    有消息说，在目前蒋介石集团同美国正处在“关系紧张”的时候，麦克耳罗伊这次去台北“访问”，是为了对蒋介石进行“打气”和“说服”工作。美国正在给蒋介石“打气”的招牌下，在台湾安设更多的基地和兵力，加强着美国自己对台湾的直接军事控制。同时，消息透露，麦克耳罗伊此行还要“说服”蒋介石减少盘踞在中国沿海岛屿的兵力，而据法新社透露，作为减少兵力的“补偿”是，美国运送它的新战术武器到这些岛屿上。这表明美国正企图直接插手金门，把它的武装控制范围扩大到中国大陆的内海岛屿上。（附图片）
