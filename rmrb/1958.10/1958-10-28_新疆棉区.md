Xinjiang Cotton Region

Xinjiang is a major component of the inland cotton region in Northwest China. The region has more than forty cotton-growing counties and forty cotton farms, with a total cotton field area of 1.8 to 1.9 million mu. The cotton fields here are mainly distributed around the Tarim Basin and the Manas River Basin.

Before liberation, cotton production in Xinjiang remained at an extremely backward level for a long time. In 1949, the region had only 470,000 mu of cotton fields, with an average yield of only 21 jin of lint cotton per mu, and a total output of just over 9.7 million jin. After liberation, under the active leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet cotton planting experts, the low-yield situation gradually changed. In 1953, the Manas River Basin cotton region achieved a high-yield record of 402 jin of seed cotton per mu on 20,000 mu of cotton fields. In 1955, the cotton fields with an average yield of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu expanded to 80,000 mu. While achieving large-scale bumper harvests, the Manas River Basin cotton region also explored a set of advanced cotton planting experiences.

The natural conditions in the Xinjiang cotton region are not superior to those in other cotton regions. The frost-free period in the Manas River Basin is only 125 to 150 days, the soil is heavily salinized, and the climate in the desert grassland is also highly variable. Therefore, Xinjiang's large-scale bumper harvest experience has played a significant role in overcoming the conservative thinking in cotton planting work in various cotton regions within the passes (referring to areas east of the strategic passes of China).

Xinjiang has vast uncultivated land and abundant water resources, making it an ideal area for developing cotton production in our country. According to surveys and estimates, Xinjiang has 70 million mu of land suitable for cotton cultivation. If one-third of this area is planted with cotton, the cotton planting area would be equivalent to two Egypts or one Uzbekistan. (Attached picture)

### 新疆棉区

    新疆棉区
    新疆是我国西北内陆棉区的主要组成部分，全区有四十多个植棉县和四十个植棉农场，棉田总面积有一百八、九十万亩。这里的棉田主要分布在塔里木盆地周围和玛纳斯河流域。
    在解放以前，新疆棉花生产长期停留在极其落后的水平上。1949年，全区仅有棉田四十七万亩，平均亩产皮棉二十一市斤，总产量不过九百七十多万斤。解放后，在党的积极领导和苏联植棉专家帮助下，才逐渐改变了低产面貌。1953年，这里的玛纳斯河流域棉区在两万亩棉田上，获得亩产籽棉四百零二斤的高产纪录。1955年，这里平均亩产籽棉四百斤的棉田又扩大到八万亩。玛纳斯河流域棉区在获得大面积丰产成绩的同时，还摸索出一套先进的植棉经验。
    新疆棉区的自然条件并不比别的棉区优越。玛纳斯河流域的无霜期只有一百二十五天到一百五十天，土壤盐渍化重，沙漠草原的气候变化也大。因此，新疆大面积丰产经验，对克服关内各棉区在植棉工作上的保守思想，起了很大作用。
    新疆荒地辽阔，水源丰富，是我国发展棉花生产的理想地区。据调查和估计，新疆全区宜棉地可有七千万亩。如果以三分之一的面积种植棉花，这个植棉面积，就相当于两个埃及或一个乌兹别克。（附图片）
