　　Eggs try to break stones, small snakes fantasize about swallowing elephants, ants try to shake big trees, mantises try to stop cars, American imperialism wants to enslave the whole world, and Chiang Kai-shek wants to counterattack the mainland and become an overlord.
  This is called:
  Moon in the water,
  Flowers in the mirror,
  You can't pick them,
  You can't scoop them up,
  The thought is good,
  But it's just a dream!
  In the end:
  Self-pity and lament,
  Bringing disaster upon oneself and self-destruction!

    梦呓
　　易和元鸡蛋想把石头撞，小蛇妄想吞大象，蚍蜉想把大树撼，螳螂想把车来挡，美帝要想奴役全世界，蒋介石想反攻大陆充霸王。
  这叫做：
  水中月，
  镜内花，
  摘又摘不着，
  捞又捞不上，
  想是想得好，
  南柯梦一场！
  到头来：
  自怨自艾自凄凉，
  自把祸找自灭亡！
