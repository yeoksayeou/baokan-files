Sichuan has seen the emergence of "Women's Furnace" groups.
Many women have become iron smelting experts.

(Our Dispatch) Since the Central Committee issued the call for the whole nation to run iron and steel production, a new force of iron and steel workers – women's iron and steel teams – has emerged in the vast rural areas of Sichuan. The "March 8th Furnaces" and "Women's Furnaces" run by women have sprung up like mushrooms. In just the three counties of Zhongxian, Fushun, and Yunyang, women are building or have already built more than 300 indigenous blast furnaces. They are undertaking the entire range of work for these furnaces, including mining and smelting, with over 7,000 participants.

Sichuan's rural women are highly enthusiastic about participating in iron and steel production. They have enthusiastically invested their usual income from household sideline occupations such as raising chickens and pigs, as well as some of their "private money," in running the iron and steel industry, and they have actively joined the iron and steel production teams. The women of Fushun County invested 160,000 yuan in one instance. Among the women in Yangdu Township, Zhongxian County, who participated in building indigenous blast furnaces, there were eighteen young women who had already received their marriage certificates, but they voluntarily postponed their weddings in order to ensure that the blast furnaces would be completed and produce iron as soon as possible. Many moving stories have emerged of mothers encouraging their daughters and sisters competing to participate in iron and steel production.

The liberated rural women of Sichuan have also demonstrated outstanding performance in iron and steel production. The indigenous blast furnace built by the women of Xiangyang Township in Yunyang County has maintained normal production since it began producing iron on August 3rd, with a daily output of more than one ton. Many women have achieved excellent results shortly after joining iron and steel production. Li Dingshu, a young woman from Qifeng Township in Fushun County, was previously only a semi-laborer in the countryside, but in less than a month of participating in iron and steel production, she became an all-rounder in mining, batching, and smelting, and was twice named a labor model.

The local Party committees and women's federations attach great importance to women's participation in iron and steel production. Many places have sent personnel to help women learn technology and provide them with multifaceted support.

    四川出现“妇女炉”群
    许多妇女变成了炼铁能手
    本报讯　自中央提出全民办钢铁的号召后，四川广大农村出现了一支新生的钢铁队伍——妇女钢铁队。由妇女举办的“三八炉”、“妇女炉”，像雨后春笋般地矗立起来。仅忠县、富顺、云阳三个县的妇女，正在兴建和已经建成的土高炉就有三百多座，她们担任着这些高炉的开矿、冶炼等全套工作，参加的人数达七千多人。
    四川农村妇女参加钢铁生产的热情很高，她们纷纷把平日养鸡、养猪等家庭副业收入和一些“私房钱”都拿出来投资办钢铁工业，并踊跃参加钢铁生产队伍。富顺县妇女一次投资十六万元。忠县洋渡乡参加修建土高炉的妇女中，有十八个已经领到结婚证书的姑娘，为了使高炉早日建成出铁，自动推迟了婚期。许多地方出现了母亲鼓励女儿、姐妹争相参加钢铁生产的动人事迹。
    解放了的四川农村妇女在钢铁生产上也有突出的表现。云阳县向阳乡妇女建立的土高炉，从8月3日开始出铁以来，生产一直正常，日产量达到一吨多。许多妇女刚刚参加钢铁生产就创造了优异成绩。富顺县起凤乡青年妇女李定书过去在农村还是个半劳动力，但参加钢铁生产不到一个月就成了一个开矿、配料、冶炼的多面手，两次被评为劳动模范。
    各地党委和妇联对妇女参加钢铁生产很重视，许多地方派出人员，帮助妇女学习技术，并给予她们多方的支持。
