    City Housewives March to the Autumn Harvest Front

    Recently, the Dongcheng District of Beijing organized more than 1,050 street residents to help farmers with the autumn harvest in the Chaoyang District in the suburbs. The residents heard that there was a severe shortage of labor in the countryside, and they rushed to sign up, requesting to participate in voluntary labor. Wang Yufang, an old lady living at No. 27 Fanziping Hutong, although in poor health, participated in every voluntary labor. Last time she signed up to dig sand and gravel, but was not approved due to her health, and she was very unhappy. This time, she was approved to participate in voluntary autumn harvest labor and was so excited that she shed tears. Most of those who participated in the autumn harvest this time were housewives in their forties and fifties, but they were also organized into squads, platoons, and companies according to the requirements of "military organization" and投入to plunge into an intense battle. For example, 38 people from the Dongzhimenwai Street Office guaranteed that they would do ten days' work in seven days and would do whatever work was assigned to them without being picky. After 87 people from the Che Nian Dian Office arrived in the countryside, they named their classes Red Flag Class and Leap Forward Class and automatically launched competitions. Dongcheng District recently organized a second batch of more than 1,200 voluntary laborers to go to the suburbs to participate in the autumn harvest and planting. (Chen Kangnian) (Attached picture)

    城市家庭妇女走上秋收前线
    北京市东城区，最近组织一千零五十多名街道居民，到市郊朝阳区帮助农民秋收。居民们听说农村劳动力非常缺乏，都争先恐后地报名，要求参加义务劳动。住在范子平胡同二十七号的王玉芳老太太，虽然身体不好，但是每次义务劳动她都参加。上次报名挖砂石，因照顾她的身体，没有被批准，她心里很不高兴。这次报名参加秋收义务劳动被批准了，兴奋得流出了眼泪。这次参加秋收的大多数是四、五十岁的家庭妇女，但她们也按着“组织军事化”的要求，编成了班、排、连队，投入紧张的战斗。如东直门外街道办事处的三十八个人保证，七天要干十天的活，给什么活干什么活，决不挑挑拣拣。车辇店办事处八十七人到达农村后，把班定名为红旗班、跃进班，自动开展了竞赛。东城区最近又组织了第二批一千二百多人的义务劳动大军，前往郊区参加秋收秋种。　（陈康年）（附图片）
