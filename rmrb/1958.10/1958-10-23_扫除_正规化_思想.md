Sweep Away "Regularization" Thought

    In just two months, Shanghai factories have established more than 2,600 various types of workers' spare-time schools. Some districts have achieved factory-wide schooling. These schools have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers. They say: "Schools are set up in factories, culture is delivered to the door, what you learn can be used, and after using it, you learn again. Cultural revolution, production leaps forward." Some advanced factories have achieved a three-in-one integration of factory, school, and research institute. Workers in the factory participate in learning and scientific research, gradually breaking down the boundaries between mental and manual labor.
    Factories running spare-time schools would presumably proceed from the actual conditions of the factory. However, this is not the case. Unless the bourgeoisie's ideology is thoroughly eliminated, it will always try every means to expose itself and attempt to seize the market. In the process of factories running spare-time schools, old-fashioned "regularization" advocates put forward the idea that "to run a university, you must follow the steps," "cultural and scientific knowledge has strict scientific and systematic qualities, and must proceed step by step, and cannot be done more, faster, better, and more economically." They also said, "Factories running universities have no equipment, no classrooms, no teaching materials, and no professors. How can this be done?" Some "orthodox" figures with strong bourgeois educational ideas openly opposed the principle that education should serve proletarian politics and production. They said:
  "What kind of specialized school is this? Isn't it just giving workers a high hat to wear?" Some technicians did not agree with starting technical courses from the beginning, believing that "you must first take three years of cultural courses and basic courses before you can take technical courses." Taking technical courses must start with "introduction." Some "trend followers" ridiculed and sneered: "Running a university is not a simple matter. Just wait and see!" These views exist not only among some full-time teachers and technicians, but also to varying degrees among the leaders of some factories and enterprises.
    Under the leadership of the Party, many factories' spare-time schools have gradually grown and consolidated in the struggle to constantly overcome various "regularization" ideas through mobilizing the broad masses of workers to speak out and debate. Many factories' spare-time schools, in accordance with the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining with productive labor, and running schools diligently and thriftily, learn what they do and make up for what they lack. Allowing selection, they adopt different methods such as all subjects, separate subjects, elective subjects, and single subjects to meet the needs of different laborers. Their "those who are capable are teachers, use local materials, teach each other, learn from each other, combine indigenous and foreign methods" solved the teacher problem. They hung blackboards in canteens, dormitories, workshops, and offices and started classes, solving the classroom problem. They invited veteran workers and technicians to cooperate, summarize production experience, self-edit and self-select, teach and revise, solving the textbook problem. Facts have proved that factories that thoroughly break the "regularization" thought run their schools well, and vice versa.
    The graduation standards recently set by the spare-time higher professional school of Tongren Alloy Plant require that each student has a firm political stance and a high degree of political consciousness. In business studies, they are required to propose ten technical innovations; each technical innovation is required to increase production efficiency by one time; they must successfully trial-produce five new products, three of which must reach the international level. In addition, they must write a paper. May I ask which "regularized" university dares to put forward such high requirements for graduates! Whether a school is regular or not is not based on whether the school has systematically learned a set of book knowledge, but on whether the students have thoroughly learned it and whether they will use the knowledge they have learned.
    The achievements of Shanghai's spare-time schools have been achieved in overcoming various forms of "regularization" thought. Some large factories with relatively good school-running conditions are often lagging behind some small factories with much worse school-running conditions in the consolidation and development of workers' spare-time schools. The more they emphasize "regularity," the more they dare not run them and cannot run them well. A large factory with thousands of workers still takes training full-time teachers as the main direction to solve the problem of a large number of teachers in its spare-time schools, and is not very active in adopting the mass line method of "those who are capable are teachers, combining indigenous and foreign methods" to solve the teacher problem. As a result, the school cannot start on time, and if it barely starts, it cannot often have classes. Therefore, continuing to fight against old-fashioned "regularization" thought is still a major task for further developing and consolidating spare-time schools in the future.

### 扫除“正规化”思想

    扫除“正规化”思想
    在短短的两个月中，上海市各工厂办起了各种类型的职工业余学校二千六百多所，有些区已做到厂厂办学。这些学校受到了广大职工群众的热烈欢迎。他们说：“学校办在厂，文化送上门，学了就能用，用了再来学，文化大革命，生产再跃进。”有些先进的工厂，已做到工厂、学校、研究院三位一体，工厂里工人，人人参加学习，人人做科学研究，逐步打破了脑力劳动和体力劳动的界限。
    工厂办业余学校，想必一定会从工厂实际出发了，其实不然，资产阶级的思想，除非彻底消灭它，否则它总要千方百计的暴露出来，并企图夺取市场。在工厂办业余学校的过程中旧型“正规化”论者提出“办大学，就得按部就班”，“文化科学知识有严格的科学性和系统性，必须循序渐进，不能多快好省”，又说：“工厂办大学，一无设备，二无教室，三无教材，四无教授，怎么行？”某些资产阶级教育思想浓厚的“正统派”，更公开出来反对教育要为无产阶级政治、为生产服务的方针，他们说：
  “这叫什么专科学校？还不是给工人戴戴高帽子”；有些技术人员不赞成一开始就上技术课，认为“一定要先上三年文化课和基础课，才能上技术课”，上技术课，必需从“序论”讲起。有些“观潮派”更冷嘲热讽地说：“办大学，可不是简单的事，等着瞧吧！”这些观点，不仅某些专职教师和技术人员中有，甚至在某些工厂、企业的领导中，也不同程度的存在着。
    在党的领导下，许多工厂的业余学校，通过发动广大职工群众的鸣放辩论，在不断克服各种
  “正规化”思想的斗争中逐步成长和巩固起来。许多工厂的业余学校根据党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、与生产劳动结合的方针和勤俭办学的原则，做什么学什么，缺什么补什么。允许选择，采用全科、分科，选科、单科单进等不同的办法满足不同劳动者的需要。他们的“能者为师，就地取材，互教互学，土洋并举”，解决了教师问题。他们在食堂、宿舍、车间、办公室，挂上了黑板，就上课，解决了教室问题。他们请老工人和技术员合作，总结生产经验，自编自选，边教边改，解决了教材问题。事实证明，凡是彻底打破“正规化”思想的工厂，学校就办得好，反之就办不好。
    铜仁合金厂的业余高等专业学校，最近订出的毕业标准：政治上要求每一学员都具有坚定的政治立场和高度政治觉悟。在业务学习上要提出十项技术革新；每项技术革新都要求提高生产效率一倍；要试制成功五种新产品，其中三种要达到国际水平。此外要写一篇论文。请问那一个“正规化”大学，敢于对毕业生提出这样高的要求！学校的正规与否，并不根据那个学校是否有次序地学了一套书本知识，而是要看学生是否学通了，学得的知识是否会用了。
    上海市业余学校的成就，就是在克服各种形式的“正规化”思想中取得的。某些办学条件比较好的大厂，在职工业余学校的巩固和发展上，往往落后于办学条件比它们差得多的某些小厂。他们越讲究“正规”，就越不敢办和办不好。有一个拥有几千工人的大厂，至今还是以培养专职教师作为解决本厂业余学校大量师资问题的主要方向，而对于“能者为师，土洋并举”的群众路线解决教师的方法，却不大积极采用。以致学校迟迟不能开学，勉强开学了，也不能经常上课。因此，继续同旧型“正规化”思想作斗争，仍然是今后进一步发展和巩固业余学校的一个重大任务。
