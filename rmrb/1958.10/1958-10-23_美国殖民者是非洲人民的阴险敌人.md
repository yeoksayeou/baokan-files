    American Colonialists Are Insidious Enemies of the African People
    Ke Yuelin
      "Imperialism—that dirty word stands for our expansionist interests in Africa. But, judging from the enormous projects undertaken by the United States to develop Africa's mineral resources alone, the British, French, Belgian, and Portuguese imperialism of the nineteenth century pales in comparison to the United States." This is what American journalist Lechie wrote when interviewing in Africa. A few strokes, however, outline the hideous face of American imperialism's voracious plunder of African colonies. Although the United States nominally has no colonies in Africa, it has in fact extended its tentacles to every corner of the continent. Whether in British Africa, French Africa, or even in countries that have gained independence, the United States' plunder and exploitation of the African people, its methods are more insidious and sinister, something that old-brand imperialist countries such as Britain and France cannot match.
    As with the aggressive policies pursued in Asia and Latin America, "U.S. Aid" has always been a tool for the United States to expand in Africa. In 1957, the so-called "economic assistance" given by the United States to Africa amounted to 60 million U.S. dollars. However, these so-called "assistance" do not depend on the needs of the assisted party, but on the economic, political, and military interests of the assisting country in these countries. For example, the funds for "strategic materials and major materials," one of the "U.S. Aid" projects, stipulate that they can only be used for appropriations for the exploitation of strategic materials and extremely scarce materials, which are of great interest to American monopoly organizations. The second project of "U.S. Aid," the "Overseas Territory Development Fund," is stipulated to be used for ground projects such as the addition of railways, the construction of strategic highways and airports. This is to facilitate the American monopoly capital to extract the above-mentioned materials and transport them out of Africa. "U.S. Aid" is also a bait to exchange for the territorial sovereignty of other countries. For example, an agreement signed between the United States and Libya in September 1954 stipulated that the United States would use 42.2 million U.S. dollars in "assistance" to obtain the right to use the Wheelus Air Base in Libya for 20 years. What is even worse is that the United States arbitrarily interferes in the internal affairs of other countries through "U.S. Aid". Since 1952, the United States has given Ethiopia nearly 100 million U.S. dollars in "assistance," but Ethiopia's foreign affairs, finance, and commerce departments have been controlled by American advisers as a result. Even the issuance of banknotes must be signed by the American who serves as the president of the Bank of Ethiopia.
    American private capital has penetrated into all aspects of Africa in every possible way. In the past eight years, American private investment in Africa has increased from 352 million U.S. dollars to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. Especially in Liberia, the Union of South Africa, and the Belgian Congo, the investment of American monopoly capital has surpassed that of Britain, France, and other countries and ranks first. The American "Firestone Tire & Rubber Company" has simply become the "Emperor" of Liberia. It has occupied large tracts of land of the Liberian people and tried to turn Liberia into "America's big rubber plantation." American imperialism is particularly greedy for the production of uranium in the Union of South Africa and the Belgian Congo, and it has almost monopolized the mining rights of uranium in these two countries. 75% of the uranium produced in these two countries is directly transported to the United States. In Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Mozambique, Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya, American oil companies are carrying out large-scale exploration and exploitation of oil projects. Recently, two overseas subsidiaries of New York Mobil Oil Company have also penetrated into Gabon and Central Congo in Equatorial Africa. Not only that, American monopoly capital also intervenes in enterprises originally dominated by British and French monopoly capital through methods such as purchasing stocks, jointly running enterprises, and providing loans. In short, as long as new ore deposits are discovered anywhere, American monopoly capital cannot wait to stick its snout in and greedily suck the blood of the local people.
      This is how American colonialists greedily plunder the wealth of Africa. According to statistics, 92% of the mineral raw materials mined from Africa every year are transported to Western Europe and the United States. The Sahara region alone supplies the United States with more than 20 kinds of necessary strategic raw materials. The investment of Wall Street bosses in Africa can be said to be a business with huge profits! The "Rhodesia Selection Trust," controlled by American capital, and the "Rhodesia Anglo-American Corporation," a joint venture between the United States and Britain, squeezed more than 170 million U.S. dollars in profits from African workers in 1956 alone. From the end of World War II to 1955, American investment in Africa increased more than fourfold. Excess profits stimulated American monopolists to expand frantically in Africa.
    To carry out bone-sucking plunder of Africa's rich resources, this is one aspect of American imperialism's expansion in Africa. In addition, just as the United States pursues a policy of arms expansion and war preparations all over the world, it has also seized a series of military bases in Africa in accordance with its own aggressive deployment, thus seriously threatening the safety of the African people. The military bases established by the United States in Morocco and Libya can accommodate the latest jet bombers and are one of the most well-equipped overseas bases. According to the North Atlantic Treaty and the "Gentleman's Agreement" with France, the United States has established huge so-called "strategic strongholds" in Casablanca, Oran, Tunis, Bizerte and other places. The United States is also actively operating in countries such as Sudan, trying to include the entire African continent in its military aggression plan. Although the establishment of these military bases by the United States in African countries is, as usual, under the guise of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, it actually seriously threatens the national independence countries of Africa and the Middle East and the surging national independence movements in those regions. According to a Turkish newspaper, the United States airlifted a large number of troops to the Adana base in Turkey when the situation in the Middle East was tense, watching the Iraqi people who had just overthrown the Faisal dynasty with fierce eyes, and this batch of invading troops took off from the air force base in Morocco, North Africa.
    The various activities of American officials in Africa are all to realize the United States' aggressive ambitions against Africa. The notorious Nixon paid a special visit to eight African countries between February and March last year, and conducted open or secret negotiations with the governments of many countries, the purpose of which was to try every means to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine." Murphy, an old hand at subversive activities, also rushed back and forth between Paris and Tunis several times at the beginning of this year. Ostensibly, it was to mediate the dispute between France and Tunisia, but in fact it was actively expanding the influence of the United States to replace France's position in North Africa. Recently, Eisenhower specially appointed an Assistant Secretary of State specifically responsible for African affairs, and established a huge African Affairs Department in the State Department. The United States has also successively established embassies and consulates in many African countries. The United States Information Service, which specializes in spreading rumors and slanders, is also actively carrying out activities in Africa. More than one-third of the increased budget for this agency in 1958 is specifically used to strengthen propaganda to Africa.
    In order to confuse world public opinion and deceive the African people, American imperialism, while invading and expanding into Africa, also hypocritically hoisted the banner of "anti-colonialism" and tried every means to disguise itself as a "friend" of small and weak countries. Eisenhower and Dulles have more than once boasted at press conferences that the United States is the maintainer of national independence and freedom. Let's see how they maintain the national independence movement! The birth of the Republic of Algeria is another symbol of the vigorous development of the African national independence movement, but the U.S. government openly expressed "disappointment" and said that there was "no reason" to recognize this government. The United States also deliberately turned a deaf ear to the establishment of the Republic of Guinea. The United States' attitude of hostility towards the national independence movements of the peoples of Southern Africa has been consistent. Everyone still remembers that the United States not only openly supported France's colonial policy towards Algeria at the United Nations General Assembly time and time again, but also actively supplied France with weapons and ammunition to support the French colonialists in suppressing the dirty war of the Algerian people. The French aircraft indiscriminately bombed the village of Sakiet in Tunisia, and the Spanish colonialists carried out bloody massacres of the Moroccan people in Ifni and Rio de Oro, using weapons supplied by the United States. In front of the broad masses of the African people, the colonialist face of the United States has become increasingly impossible to conceal.
    However, no matter whether imperialism uses cruel suppression or flowery deception, the raging fire of anti-colonialism is rapidly spreading and expanding in various parts of Africa. Its spearhead is not only directed at the old-brand imperialism of Britain and France, but also at the new colonialism of the United States. The Moroccan people recently launched a massive "Yankee Go Home" movement. Moroccan King Mohammed V recently mentioned in an interview with a reporter from the Cairo "News" that American troops should withdraw from Moroccan territory. A demonstration against the signing of a "U.S. Aid Agreement" with the United States took place in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. When the Sudanese parliament discussed accepting "U.S. Aid," 97 of the 198 members voted against it. In the large companies controlled by American monopoly capital, workers often go on strike because they cannot bear the abuse. These actions reflect the increasingly strong desire of the African people to get rid of the shackles imposed on them by the United States. In particular, the recent open armed invasion of Lebanon by the U.S. military and the military provocations against our country have made the African people more clearly aware of the two-faced nature of American imperialism, which is honey-tongued and sword-hearted. It is the most ferocious enemy of all countries striving for national independence and freedom. The African people's movement for national liberation is an irresistible torrent, and neither the old-brand imperialism of Britain and France nor the new colonialism of the United States can stop this tide from surging forward.

    美国殖民者是非洲人民的阴险敌人
    柯月霖
      “帝国主义——这个肮脏的字眼代表我们在非洲的扩张利益。但是，就美国开发非洲的巨大矿源的工程项目单来看，十九世纪英国、法国、比利时和葡萄牙帝国主义比起美国来是小巫见大巫。”这是美国记者勒希在非洲进行采访时所写的一段话。淡淡几笔，却勾画了美帝国主义穷凶极恶地掠夺非洲殖民地的狰狞面目。尽管美国在非洲名义上没有殖民地，但它实际上早已把触须伸展到这个大陆的各个角落，不管是在英属非洲，或者法属非洲，甚至在已经获得独立的国家中，美国对非洲人民的掠夺和剥削，其手法之阴险和毒辣，实为英法等老牌帝国主义国家所望尘莫及。
    如同在亚洲、拉丁美洲推行的侵略政策一样，“美援”一直是美国在非洲进行扩张的工具。1957年，美国给予非洲的所谓“经济援助”达六千万美元。可是，这些所谓“援助”不决定于被援助者的需要，而取决于援助国在这些国家中的经济和政治、军事的利益。如“美援”的项目之一“战略物资和主要物资”的资金，就规定只能用作开采战略物资和极端缺乏的物资的拨款，而这些物资是美国垄断组织极感兴趣的。“美援”的项目之二“开发海外领土基金”，被规定用来进行地面工程，如铁路的增建、战略公路和机场的修建等。这是为了便于美国垄断资本把上述物资开采出来后从非洲运送出去。“美援”还是换取别个国家领土主权的钓饵，如美国在1954年9月和利比亚签订的一项协定，就规定美国以四千二百万美元的“援助”来取得对利比亚惠勒斯基地使用二十年的权利。更有甚者，美国竟通过“美援”任意干涉其他国家的内政。自1952年以来，美国共给了埃塞俄比亚将近一亿美元的“援助”，但是埃塞俄比亚的外交、财政和商业等部门就因此受美国顾问的控制，甚至发行钞票也得由担任埃塞俄比亚银行行长的美国人签字。
    美国的私人资本更是无孔不入地渗入到非洲的各个方面。在最近八年中，美国在非洲的私人投资已由三亿五千二百万美元增加到十二亿美元。特别是在利比里亚、南非联邦和比属刚果，美国垄断资本的投资已经超过英法等国跃居第一。美国的“费尔斯通轮胎橡胶公司”简直成了利比里亚的“太上皇”，它霸占了利比里亚人民的大片土地，并力图把利比里亚变成“美国的大橡胶园”。美帝国主义特别垂涎南非联邦和比属刚果的铀的生产，它几乎垄断了这两个国家铀的开采权。这两个国家生产的铀的75％直接输往美国。在突尼斯、摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、莫三鼻给、安哥拉、尼日利亚、加纳、怯尼亚，美国石油公司正在进行大规模的勘探和开采石油的工程。最近，纽约美孚油公司在国外的两个子公司又渗入了赤道非洲的加蓬和中央刚果。不仅如此，美国垄断资本还通过收买股票、合办企业和贷款等方法，插足于原来英法等国垄断资本占优势的企业。总之，只要哪里发现了新的矿苗，美国垄断资本便迫不及待地把猪嘴伸了进去，贪婪地吮吸当地人民的膏血。
      美国殖民者就是这样贪得无厌地掠夺着非洲的财富。据统计，每年从非洲开采出来的矿物原料，92％都被运往西欧和美国，单撒哈拉地区就供给美国二十多种必要的战略原料。华尔街大老板在非洲的投资真可以说是一本万利！受美国资本控制的“罗得西亚选矿托辣斯”和美英合资的“罗得西亚英美股份有限公司”，1956年就从非洲工人身上榨取了一亿七千多万美元的利润。从第二次世界大战结束到1955年，美国在非洲的投资增加了四倍以上。超额利润刺激着美国垄断资本家们在非洲疯狂地进行扩张。
    对非洲的富饶资源进行敲骨吸髓的掠夺，这是美帝国主义在非洲扩张的一个方面，此外，正同美国在世界各地推行扩军备战政策一样，它在非洲也按照自己的侵略部署霸占了一系列的军事基地，因而严重地威胁着非洲人民的安全。美国在摩洛哥和利比亚建立的军事基地，能停留最新式的喷气轰炸机，是设备最完善的国外基地之一。美国根据北大西洋公约和同法国的“君子协定”，在卡萨布兰卡、阿兰、突尼斯、比塞大等地建立了巨大的所谓“战略据点”。美国还在苏丹等国积极活动，企图把整个非洲都囊括在它的军事侵略计划之内。美国在非洲国家建立这些军事基地，虽然照例打着反苏反共的幌子，而实际上却严重地威胁着非洲和中东的民族独立国家和那些地区风起云涌的民族独立运动。据一家土耳其报纸透露，美国在中近东局势紧张之际空运了大批军队到达土耳其的亚达那基地，虎视眈眈地窥伺着刚推翻费萨尔王朝的伊拉克人民，而这批侵略军队就是从北非摩洛哥的空军基地起飞的。
    美国官员在非洲的种种活动，也都是为了实现美国对非洲的侵略野心。臭名昭彰的尼克松在去年2—3月间特别访问了非洲八个国家，并同许多国家的政府进行了公开的或秘密的谈判，其目的是千方百计地推销“艾森豪威尔主义”。搞颠复活动的老手墨菲，在今年年初也匆匆地多次奔走于巴黎和突尼斯之间，名义上是调停法国和突尼斯的纠纷，实际上是积极扩张美国的势力，以取代法国在北非的地位。最近，艾森豪威尔特别任命了一个专门负责非洲事务的助理国务卿，并在国务院设立了庞大的非洲事务司。美国还在非洲很多国家陆续设立了大使馆和领事馆。专门从事造谣诽谤的美国新闻处也在非洲积极展开活动，这个机关1958年增加的经费预算，有三分之一以上是专门用来加强对非洲的宣传的。
    美帝国主义为了迷惑世界舆论和欺骗非洲人民，在它向非洲侵略扩张的同时还假冒为善地打着“反殖民主义”的旗帜，并千方百计地把自己装扮成弱小国家的“朋友”。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在记者招待会上，曾不止一次地吹嘘美国是民族独立和自由的维护者。且看他们是如何维护民族独立运动的吧！阿尔及利亚共和国的诞生，这是非洲民族独立运动蓬勃发展的又一标志，但是美国政府却公然表示“感到失望”，还说“没有理由”要承认这个政府。对几内亚共和国的成立，美国也故意装聋作哑。美国敌视南非洲各国人民民族独立运动的这种态度是一贯的。大家还记得，美国不仅三番五次地在联合国大会上公开支持法国对待阿尔及利亚的殖民政策，而且还积极供应法国武器和弹药，支持法国殖民者镇压阿尔及利亚人民的肮脏战争。法国飞机对突尼斯萨基埃特村的滥施轰炸，西班牙殖民者在伊夫尼和里约—德—奥罗对摩洛哥人民的血腥屠杀，使用的也都是美国供给的武器。在广大的非洲人民面前，美国的殖民主义面目已经越来越没有办法掩盖了。
    但是，不论帝国主义施展残酷的镇压手段或者是花言巧语的欺骗，反殖民主义的熊熊烈火却在非洲各地迅速蔓延、扩大，其矛头不仅指向英法老牌帝国主义，同时也指向美国新殖民主义。摩洛哥人民最近就掀起了一个声势浩大的“美国佬滚回去”运动，摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世最近对开罗“消息报”记者的谈话中，就提到要美国军队从摩洛哥的领土上撤退。苏丹首都喀土穆曾经发生了反对同美国签订“美援协定”的示威游行，苏丹议会在讨论接受“美援”时，一百九十八个议员中有九十七人投了反对票。在美国垄断资本控制的大公司里，工人们不堪虐待也经常举行罢工。这些行动都反映了非洲人民日益强烈地要求摆脱美国强加在他们身上的桎梏的愿望。特别是美国军队最近对黎巴嫩的公开武装侵略和对我国的军事挑衅，使非洲人民更清楚地认识到美帝国主义口蜜腹剑的两面手法，它是一切争取民族独立和自由的国家的最凶恶的敌人。非洲人民争取民族解放的运动是一股不可抗拒的洪流，英法老牌帝国主义也好，美国新殖民主义也好，都无法阻挡这股潮流汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
