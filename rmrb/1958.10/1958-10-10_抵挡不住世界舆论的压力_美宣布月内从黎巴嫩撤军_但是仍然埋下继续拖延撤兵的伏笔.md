Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: Because the armed intervention in Lebanon has been strongly opposed by the people of Lebanon and peace-loving people all over the world, the US State Department was forced to declare on the 8th that "unless unforeseen circumstances arise," the US intervention troops will withdraw from Lebanon before the end of October this year.

The statement said: "The decision to withdraw troops was made in agreement with the Lebanese government." Prior to this, Lebanese Prime Minister Karami had publicly demanded that all US troops must be withdrawn no later than the end of October. The firm attitude of the Karami government directly deprived US imperialism of its excuse for refusing to withdraw its troops. The US authorities had repeatedly stated that the US would not withdraw from Lebanon unless requested by the legitimate government of Lebanon.

In his speech, White refused to specify what the "unforeseen circumstances" mentioned in the statement referred to. It is believed that this additional condition in the statement shows that although the United States has to withdraw its troops, it is still looking for new excuses for the possible continued delay in the withdrawal of intervention troops.

According to a report, the newly appointed Commander of the Southern European Allied Forces of the North Atlantic Group, US Navy Vice Admiral Brown, revealed on the 7th that the US Sixth Fleet will remain in the Mediterranean for a long time in order to suppress the national independence movement in the region. Brown was originally the commander of the US Sixth Fleet. He said that the fifty or sixty warships of the Sixth Fleet are scattered over the vast sea of the Mediterranean. These ships will remain in the Mediterranean for a long time to "encourage our friends and warn our enemies."

    抵挡不住世界舆论的压力
    美宣布月内从黎巴嫩撤军
    但是仍然埋下继续拖延撤兵的伏笔
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：由于武装干涉黎巴嫩的行动遭到黎巴嫩和全世界爱好和平的人民的强烈反对，美国国务院被迫在8日声明，“除非出现无法预料的局势”，美国干涉军将在今年10月底以前撤出黎巴嫩。
    声明说：“撤军的决定是在同黎巴嫩政府协议之下作出的”。在这以前，黎巴嫩总理卡拉米曾经公开要求美国军队最迟必须在10月底以前全部撤出。卡拉米政府的坚决态度直接剥夺了美帝国主义拒不撤兵的借口，美国当局曾经一再表示，如果不是黎巴嫩合法政府的要求，美国将不从黎巴嫩撤军。
    怀特在发言中拒绝说明声明中所提到的“无法预料的局势”是指什么。人们认为，声明中这一附加的条件表明了，尽管美国不得不撤军，但是它还在替干涉军可能的继续拖延撤兵寻找新的借口。
    另据新任北大西洋集团南欧盟军司令的美国海军中将布朗7日透露，美国第六舰队将长期留在地中海，以便镇压这一地区内的民族独立运动。布朗原来是美第六舰队司令。他说，第六舰队的五六十艘军舰分散在地中海的广大海面上。这些舰只将长期留在地中海以“鼓励我们的朋友和告诫我们的敌人”。
