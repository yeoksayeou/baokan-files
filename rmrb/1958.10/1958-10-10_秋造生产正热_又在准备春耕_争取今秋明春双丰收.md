Vietnam is Leaping Forward

    Autumn Harvest Production is in Full Swing; Spring Planting is Already Being Prepared
    Strive for a Double Harvest This Autumn and Next Spring
    Currently, the upsurge of autumn harvest production in North Vietnam has not yet ended, and an upsurge in preparing for spring planting next year has already begun. The time to start preparing for spring planting next year has been moved up by two months compared to previous years. Cadres and farmers in various regions are striving to achieve a "double harvest this autumn and next spring."
    Since the end of September, many districts, provinces, and villages in North Vietnam have held spring agricultural production conferences, formulated production plans, and actively started preparations.
    At the spring agricultural production conference in Kien An province, many mutual aid teams launched a competition to "apply more fertilizer to autumn rice and prepare for the summer rice next year." They set a target of striving to produce an average of three tons of summer rice per hectare of land next year. The meeting also decided to implement dense planting on all cultivated land in the province and to ensure an average application of more than 150 "tia" (shoulder pole loads) of fertilizer per Vietnamese "mu" (one Vietnamese "mu" equals 5.5 Chinese "mu").
    With the production experience gained from striving for a bumper autumn rice harvest this year, farmers in North Vietnam have confidence in increasing production. Therefore, the phenomenon of repeatedly raising the total output and unit area yield targets for the next summer rice crop has become widespread.
    The spring production plans of many provinces and villages reflect the increasingly strong demands of the masses to establish rural small-scale industries, vigorously promote agricultural technology, and engage in large-scale water conservancy projects. Kien An province recently decided that small-scale farm tool plants will be established in various counties in the spring to manufacture various farm tools and waterwheels for farmers. The Vinh Thanh township branch of the Vietnamese Labor Party in Nghe An province, based on the enthusiastic demand of the masses to realize collectivization, has formulated a plan to absorb 70% of the total number of farming households in the township into agricultural production cooperatives by the end of next year. They also plan to widely use Chinese experience in the spring to cultivate high-yield experimental fields and build a small biogas power station. Many provinces have also formulated plans to build dikes and dig irrigation ditches on a large scale.

### 秋造生产正热　又在准备春耕  争取今秋明春双丰收

    越南在跃进
    秋造生产正热　又在准备春耕
    争取今秋明春双丰收
    目前，越南北方秋造生产热潮还没有结束，一个为明年春耕作好准备的热潮已经开始到来。开始为明年春耕进行准备的时间比往年提早了两个月。各地的干部和农民正在为实现“今秋明春双丰收”而奋斗。
    越南北方的许多区、省、乡从9月底以来就纷纷召开了明春农业生产会议，制订生产计划，积极展开准备工作。
    在建安省的明春农业生产会议上，许多变工组发动了“为秋稻多下肥，为明年夏稻作准备”的竞赛。他们确定了明年争取平均每公顷土地生产夏稻谷子三吨的指标。会议还决定全省耕地全部实行密植，并且保证达到每越亩（一越亩合五点五市亩）平均施肥一百五十挑以上。
    越南北方的农民有了今秋争取秋稻丰收的生产经验，对增产有了信心，因此各地普遍出现再三提高明年夏稻总产量和单位面积产量指标的现象。
    许多省、乡的明春生产计划反映了农民群众要求办农村小型工业、大力推广农业技术和大搞水利的日益强烈的要求。建安省最近决定，明春将在各县设立小型农具场，制造各种农具和水车供应农民使用。越南劳动党宜安省永成乡支部根据群众要求实现合作化的热潮，订出了在明年年底把占全乡农户总数70％的农户吸收入农业生产合作社的计划。他们还准备在明春普遍利用中国的经验，培植高产试验田，并且将建设一个小型沼气发电站。许多省还订出了大规模筑堤和挖灌溉沟的计划。
