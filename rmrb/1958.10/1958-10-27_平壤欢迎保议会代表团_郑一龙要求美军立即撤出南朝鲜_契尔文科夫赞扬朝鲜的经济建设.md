Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 26th - DPRK Deputy Premier Zheng Yilong said this afternoon at a rally held in Pyongyang by people from all walks of life to welcome the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation that the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely withdrawn from North Korea yesterday, and the US military has no excuse to remain in South Korea. Peace-loving people around the world strongly demand that the US military withdraw from South Korea immediately and are closely watching the actions of the US imperialists.

The rally was held at the National Art Theater at 4:00 PM today. Premier Kim Il-sung and other leaders of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Republic's government attended the rally. In his speech, Zheng Yilong expressed a warm welcome to the Bulgarian delegation headed by Chervenkov. He warmly praised the brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian people in socialist construction. He emphasized that in recent years, when imperialists launched an anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave and international revisionists slandered the Soviet Union and undermined the unity of the socialist camp, the Bulgarian Communist Party, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, together with fraternal parties, made great contributions to smashing the conspiracies of imperialists and revisionists and safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism. He said that the Workers' Party of Korea will stand side by side with the fraternal Bulgarian Communist Party and move forward together.

Zheng Yilong expressed his gratitude to Bulgaria for the assistance it provided to the Korean people during and after the war. He said that the delegation's visit to North Korea will make new contributions to strengthening Korean-Bulgarian friendship. He said that the Korean people will make every effort to strengthen the friendship and unity with the Bulgarian people.

Chervenkov spoke amidst warm applause. He first warmly praised the achievements and speed of socialist construction of the Korean people. He said that the Korean people can reunify their country on a democratic basis along the correct path pointed out by the Workers' Party of Korea. Chervenkov said that US imperialists continue to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, dividing Korea and Vietnam, and are conducting military provocations in the Taiwan Strait. He said that the entire socialist camp stands on the side of the People's China, People's Korea, and People's Vietnam.
