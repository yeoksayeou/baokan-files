Overcome the Severe Cold, Produce More Good Iron
By Our Staff Commentator

In October, the national monthly output of pig iron should double that of September, and the daily output should average more than 100,000 tons. In November and December, the leap forward will be even greater, and the tasks will be even heavier. However, from now on, natural conditions will become increasingly unfavorable, and the severe cold is approaching step by step. Severe cold is a major enemy facing native blast furnaces. The vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of native blast furnaces across the country use cold air. Once the climate drops below zero degrees, the iron and slag will not separate properly, and the sulfur content will increase. The furnace may even freeze, leading to even more serious consequences.

How should we deal with this impending situation? Surrender to nature? Of course not. We believe that the tens of millions of fighters beside the native blast furnaces will answer in unison: We must overcome the severe cold; the colder the weather, the more iron we must produce, and the better the quality must be!

Breaking through this technical barrier is actually not complicated, and the method already exists. That is: to universally heat the air for native blast furnaces. Heating the air for native blast furnaces achieves multiple benefits at once. First, it can enable the furnace to safely survive the winter and maintain normal production. Second, it can increase production. In Guizhou Province, the addition of hot air to native furnaces has generally doubled pig iron production. Even if other places cannot reach this level, they can at least increase it by one-third. Third, heating the air for native blast furnaces can also improve the quality of pig iron, enabling many furnaces to transform from producing only white pig iron for casting iron pots and iron plows, to producing gray pig iron for casting machines. It can also greatly reduce the sulfur content of high-sulfur pig iron and "sintered iron" and "sponge iron" that cannot be directly used for steelmaking or casting, improving the quality of pig iron and reducing the difficulty of steelmaking from native iron. Fourth, with the addition of hot air, fuel consumption can be reduced by about one-third, which can also alleviate the tight situation of coking coal and charcoal in some areas. Combining these benefits, pig iron production will smoothly achieve a greater leap forward in the three winter months. It can be seen that heating the air for native furnaces is not a small technical problem, but a major event of great significance.

Heating the air for native furnaces should also use native methods. Today's People's Daily introduces the soil hot blast stove successfully tested by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which does not use steel materials. In the past, we also introduced the soil hot blast stoves in Guizhou and Sichuan, and other provinces and cities also have experience in heating the air for soil furnaces. We hope that all localities, especially the provinces north of the Yangtze River, will quickly promote these experiences, and strive to arm all native blast furnaces with hot air by October, ensuring that in the cold winter, more and better iron is produced!

    战胜严寒，多出好铁
    本报评论员
    10月份，全国生铁的月产量要比9月份翻一番，日产量要平均达到十万吨以上。11月和12月，跃进的幅度将更大，任务将越重。可是，从今往后，自然条件却越来越差了，严寒已经在一步步地逼近来。严寒，这是土高炉面临的一个大敌。现在全国几十万座土高炉，绝大部分用的是冷风。这样的炉子，当气候一旦降到零度以下，就会弄得铁渣不分，含硫量升高。甚至炉膛可能冻结，产生更严重的恶果。
    怎样应付这即将到来的局势呢？向大自然投降吗？当然不。我们相信，土高炉旁几千万个战士都会同声回答：一定要战胜严寒；天气越冷，出铁越要多，质量越要好！
    突破这道技术关，其实并不复杂，方法已经有了。这就是：给土高炉普遍加热风。土高炉加热风，一举而数得。第一，它可以使炉子安全过冬，保持正常生产。第二，它可以提高产量。贵州省给土炉子加上热风，生铁产量普遍提高一倍。其他地方即使达不到这个水平，至少也可以提高三分之一。第三，土高炉加热风，还可以提高生铁的质量，可以使许多炉子由原来只能生产铸造铁锅、铁犁的白口铁，变成能够生产铸造机器的灰口铁，可以使含硫较高的生铁和不能直接炼钢或铸造的“烧结铁”、“海绵铁”含硫量大大降低，改善生铁的质量，减轻土铁炼钢的困难。第四，加了热风，燃料的消耗可以减少三分之一左右，这样，焦煤和某些地区木炭的紧张状况也可以得到缓和。这几个好处加在一起，在冬季的三个月里，生铁的生产就会顺利地实现更大的跃进。由此可见，给土炉子加热风，并不是一个小小的技术问题，而是一件有重要意义的大事情。
    给土炉子加热风，同样应当使用土办法。今天本报介绍了冶金工业部试验成功的不用钢铁材料的土热风炉，过去还介绍过贵州和四川的土热风炉，其他省市也都有土炉加热风的经验。我们希望各个地方，特别是长江以北各省，很快地推广这些经验，力争在10月份以内把所有的土高炉都用热风武装起来，保证在严寒的冬季，铁出得更多、更好！
