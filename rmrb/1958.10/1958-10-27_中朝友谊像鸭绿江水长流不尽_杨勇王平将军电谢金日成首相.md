Xinhua News Agency, Andong, October 26th: General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, upon returning to the border city of Andong in the motherland, sent a telegram of gratitude to Premier Kim Il-sung. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    Respected Premier Kim Il-sung:
    We, along with all the comrades of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, filled with the incomparably profound friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people, have returned to our motherland today. With this, the proposal of the governments of China and Korea to proactively withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea in order to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the decision announced by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to withdraw from Korea in batches by the end of this year, have been fully realized.
    Respected Premier, during the eight years that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army was in Korea, we received meticulous care and wholehearted support from the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and all the Korean people, and received brotherly assistance and cooperation from the Korean People's Army. Since the withdrawal of troops began in March of this year, each batch of withdrawing troops has received a warm send-off from all the Korean people. When the Volunteer Army headquarters withdrew from Korea, you personally met us in Pyongyang, giving us kind encouragement and a grand farewell, and received warm hospitality from the people of Pyongyang. Along the way, we were repeatedly given cordial send-offs. All of this has deeply moved us. We believe that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Korea, further consolidated and developed through the common struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, will flow endlessly like the waters of the Yalu River and remain evergreen like the pine trees of Changbai Mountain. As we have now fully returned to our motherland, please allow us, on behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, to express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect once again to you and, through you, to the heroic Korean people and the fraternal Korean People's Army.
    We wish the Korean people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live the militant friendship between the people of China and Korea forged in blood!
            Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Yang Yong
            Political Commissar Wang Ping
                    October 26, 1958, in Andong

    敬爱的首相同志，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的八年间，得到了朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府以及全体朝鲜人民对我们无微不至的关怀与竭尽全力的支援，得到了朝鲜人民军兄弟般的帮助和合作。在今年3月开始撤军以来，每批撤出部队都得到了朝鲜人民全民性的热烈欢送。志愿军总部撤出朝鲜时，在平壤受到您亲自接见，给予亲切的勉励和隆重的送别，受到了平壤人民热烈的款待，在沿途各地，又一再受到盛情送别。这一切，都使我们深受感动。我们相信，中朝两国人民经过反抗美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争而进一步巩固发展起来的兄弟友谊，必将像鸭绿江的流水一样长流不尽，像长白山的松树一样万古常青。在我们已经全部回到祖国的时候，请允许我们代表中国人民志愿军全体同志，向您并通过您向英雄的朝鲜人民，向兄弟般的朝鲜人民军，再一次致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    祝朝鲜人民在争取祖国和平统一和社会主义建设事业中取得更加辉煌的成就！
