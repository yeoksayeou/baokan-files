Shanghai, October 9th (from our newspaper) - After twenty-one days and nights of arduous struggle, faculty and students of the East China Institute of Chemical Technology have preliminarily succeeded in experimenting with a one-step steelmaking method using natural gas. The success of this method will bring about a major revolution in steelmaking technology.

Up to now, no country in the world has used natural gas to make steel. Usually, steelmaking always starts with smelting pig iron from ore in a blast furnace, and then using pig iron as raw material to make steel in a steelmaking furnace. Using the one-step natural gas steelmaking method, steel can be directly made from ore, eliminating the process of smelting iron from ore, and the enormous economic value of this is self-evident. Using this method to make steel can also shorten production time, because using the old method of steelmaking, it generally takes about eight hours from adding ore to making steel, while this method takes only about one and a half hours to directly transform ore into steel. At the same time, general pig iron smelting requires a large amount of metallurgical coke. Metallurgical coke is not only expensive, but also very inconvenient to transport (Shanghai's metallurgical coke is mostly transported from the Northeast). If natural gas is used for steelmaking, coking coal can be avoided.

Fuzhou, October 9th (from our newspaper) - The masses in Zhouning County, Fujian Province, have designed their own indigenous steelmaking furnace that can directly smelt iron sand into steel. Currently, seven agricultural cooperatives in the county have built eleven such indigenous steelmaking furnaces.

This type of indigenous steelmaking furnace is square both inside and out, wider at the bottom and narrower at the top. The top of the furnace is funnel-shaped, the furnace body is nineteen feet high, divided into two sections, the furnace core penetrates the ground, and the furnace wall is about seven feet wide. Because the problem of coke has not yet been resolved, wood charcoal is currently used as fuel, with manual bellows providing the blast.

When making steel, a small amount of wood charcoal is used to bake the furnace first, and then gradually increased until it reaches the furnace mouth. After baking all night, when the charcoal falls to the trumpet seat, the first batch of iron sand and charcoal can be added (one hundred catties of charcoal, fifty to seventy catties of iron sand). After that, forty to sixty catties of iron sand and one hundred catties of charcoal are added every hour or so, for a total of twenty-eight times. When adding materials, a hole should be poked in the red charcoal at the top of the furnace, the iron sand should be poured into the hole, and then charcoal should be added. The wind force should be kept even. In this way, a furnace of steel can be produced in fifty-two hours, with each furnace producing more than three hundred catties of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 9th - Employees of the Yantai Machine Tool Accessories Factory, after more than ten experiments, have directly smelted iron sand into steel using crucibles.

The iron sand they used contains more than 56% iron. In the first two experiments, they used lime to bind the iron sand into balls, dried them, and put them into a pig iron furnace for smelting, but the result was all slag. Later, they switched to using a crucible furnace for smelting. They tried four times, but all failed because the temperature inside the crucible did not reach 1500 degrees Celsius and there was a lack of reducing agent in the furnace. But they were not discouraged and continued with a fifth experiment using crucibles. This time, based on the chemical composition of the iron sand, they determined the amount of reducing agent to be added. The ratio of the furnace charge was four catties of iron sand, 15% coke powder, and 10% limestone. The temperature during smelting reached more than 1500 degrees Celsius. As a result, one and a half catties of steel were smelted from four catties of iron sand. However, this piece of steel had a high sulfur content, and cracked when forged, so it could not be used as steel. They then tried all kinds of methods to reduce the sulfur content, and finally smelted high-carbon steel that met the ideal requirements.

    上海利用天然气一步炼钢初步成功
    一个半小时矿砂变成钢
    周宁、烟台用铁砂直接炼出了钢
    本报上海9日电　经过二十一个昼夜苦战，华东化工学院师生，初步试验成功了天然气一步炼钢法。这个方法的成功，将使炼钢技术来一个大革命。
    到目前为止，世界上还没有一个国家利用天然气炼钢。通常炼钢总是先从矿砂在高炉中炼出生铁，然后再用生铁作原料在炼钢炉中炼出钢来。采用天然气一步炼钢法，就可从矿砂直接炼成钢，省掉矿砂炼铁这一道手续，其经济价值之大可想见。用这个方法炼钢，还可以缩短生产时间，因为用老办法炼钢，从加矿砂到炼成钢，一般需要八小时左右，用这个方法只要一个半小时左右即可把矿砂直接变成钢。同时一般炼生铁需要大量冶金焦。冶金焦不但价格贵，并且运输很不方便（上海的冶金焦大都是远从东北运来的）。如果采用天然气炼钢，就可以不用焦煤。
    本报福州9日电　福建省周宁县群众自己设计的一种土炼钢炉，可以把铁砂直接炼成钢。现在全县已有七个农业社建了十一座这种土炼钢炉。
    这种土炼钢炉，里外都是四方形，下大上小，炉顶是喇叭斗式，炉身高度为一丈九尺，分成二节，炉心透地，炉壁宽度在七尺左右。由于焦炭问题尚未解决，目前是以木炭作燃料，用手拉风箱鼓风。
    炼钢时，先以少数的木炭烘炉，然后慢慢加多，直到炉口为止。烘了一个晚上，炭落到喇叭座时，就可以加第一次铁砂和炭（炭一百斤，铁砂五十斤至七十斤），此后每一小时左右再加四十斤到六十斤铁砂，一百斤炭，共加二十八次。在加料时，要把炉顶的红炭拨一个窟，将铁砂集中倒入窟内，再加上炭。风力要保持均匀。这样，五十二小时就可出一炉钢，每炉可产钢三百多斤。
    新华社济南9日电　烟台机床附件厂职工经过十多次试验，用坩锅把铁砂直接炼成了钢。
    它们用的铁砂，含铁在56％以上。头两次试验，他们将铁砂用石灰粘结起来，做成圆球，烘干后放到猪嘴炉里进行熔炼，结果出来的全是熔渣。后来他们又改用坩锅炉来炼，前后试炼了四次，都因为坩锅内的温度没有达到摄氏一千五百度和炉内缺乏还原剂等而失败。但他们并不灰心，继续用坩锅进行第五次试验。这次他们根据铁砂的化学成份，确定了还原剂的加入量，炉料的比例是四斤铁砂，15％的焦炭粉，10％的石灰石，熔炼时温度达到摄氏一千五百多度。结果从四斤铁砂中炼出一斤半钢。但是这块钢含硫量太高，锻打时就裂纹，不能当钢用。他们又想尽各种办法减少了含硫量，终于炼出了合乎理想的高碳钢。
