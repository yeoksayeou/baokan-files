Xinhua News Agency, 13th. An article written by renowned Canadian journalist and international affairs expert MacGeachy, published in the "Washington Post" on October 6th, criticizes the various fallacies used by the United States to justify its policy of expanding the scope of aggression in the Taiwan Strait area.

MacGeachy said, I dare say that any fair court "would definitely rule that these islands (Kinmen and Matsu) are part of China, and the Beijing government has the right to drive out the enemy troops stationed on these islands for its own security, and eliminate harmful things and threats on its doorstep."

MacGeachy pointed out that Eisenhower's claim that China's shelling of Kinmen was an attempt to change territory by force. He then wrote: "But let us frankly ask: If Beijing politely requested the return of these islands through normal diplomatic channels, does it have any hope or possibility of controlling these islands?"

MacGeachy said, "Are we going to wage war—perhaps with nuclear weapons—to maintain the United States' extremely unrealistic attitude on these islands? This seems meaningless to me."

He said, "It is very dishonest to compare the Chinese government's perfectly reasonable desire to control the coastal islands, as Eisenhower did, to Hitler's annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the rest of Europe. There is absolutely nothing in common between the two."

He continued: "I want to ask: What is the entire position of the United States in the Far East that is now being defended? As any rational Chinese can judge, the purpose of the United States is to undermine the Beijing government, undo the 1949 Chinese revolution, and restore Chiang Kai-shek. In my opinion, this is fundamentally unworkable; even the powerful United States cannot do it. The attempt to do so will eventually involve all of us in a nuclear war, the consequences of which are unpredictable."

    艾森豪威尔不老实
    加拿大名记者麦克吉契驳斥美国侵略谰言
    新华社13日讯　“华盛顿邮报”10月6日登载的加拿大著名的新闻记者和国际问题专家麦克吉契所写的一篇文章，抨击了美国为它的在台湾海峡地区扩大侵略范围的政策辩解的种种谰言。
    麦克吉契说，我敢说，任何一个公正的法庭“一定会判定，这些岛屿（金门和马祖）是中国的一部分，北京政府有权为了自身的安全而把在这些岛屿上的敌人驻军赶走，消除自己台阶上的有害的东西和威胁”。
    麦克吉契指出，艾森豪威尔说什么中国炮击金门是企图用武力来作出领土的改变，他接着写道：“但是让我们坦率地问道：北京如果通过正常的外交途径彬彬有礼地要求收回这些岛屿，它是否有控制这些岛屿的希望或可能？”
    麦克吉契说，“难道我们一定要为了保持美国在这些岛屿问题上的极不现实的态度而进行战争——也许是同核弹来作战——吗？这在我看来是没有意义的。”
    他说：“像艾森豪威尔所做的那样把中国政府希望控制沿海岛屿的十分合理的愿望比作希特勒并吞奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰以及欧洲其余国家的愿望，是非常不诚实的。两者之间毫无相同之处。”
    他接着说：“我要问：现在正在保卫的美国在远东的整个地位是什么？就任何一个有理性的中国人可以判断的，美国的目的是破坏北京政府，取消1949年中国革命和使蒋介石复辟。据我看，这是根本行不通的；即使强大的美国也办不到的。这样做的企图最后将使我们大家卷入一场核战争中去，其后果是无法预料的。”在抗议信的海洋里
