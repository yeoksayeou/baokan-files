Xinhua News Agency, London, 13th—The British-Chinese Friendship Association convened a public gathering here tonight, resolutely demanding that the American armed forces withdraw from the Taiwan Strait.

The resolution, unanimously adopted by the participants at the meeting, pointed out that the dangerous situation in the Far East is caused by the continued American interference in China's internal affairs.

The resolution stated: "Taiwan, Jinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territory. The solution to the problems concerning these islands is China's internal affair. Any foreign interference in this dispute can only lead to the escalation of tensions and ultimately to war."

The resolution also stated: "For the sake of peace in the Far East and the world, it is crucial that the United States cease its interference in China's internal affairs and withdraw its troops from Chinese territorial waters."

The participants at the meeting also sent a petition to British Prime Minister Macmillan, which was signed by four hundred people. The petition urged the British government to "frankly declare that the presence of American troops in the Taiwan Strait is a threat of war, and that Britain will absolutely not be involved in such a war."

The meeting was chaired by Dr. Burhop, a renowned nuclear physicist at the University of London. Lord Pethick-Lawrence, a Labour Party Member of the House of Lords, spoke at the meeting, saying that no action by the United States or any other country can change the fact that the government on the mainland has the support of six hundred million people and is the sole legitimate government of China.

He historically demonstrated that Taiwan and the coastal islands belong to China and demanded the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Another speaker, Reverend Borjes, emphasized that the U.S. Army and Navy leaders, who have been concentrating large numbers of armed forces in the Taiwan Strait, are the most dangerous figures in the world today.

    英中友协集会通过决议
    台湾金马是中国领土
    美国军队必须撤出去
    新华社伦敦13日电　英中友好协会今晚在这里召开了公众集会，坚决要求美国武装部队撤出台湾海峡。
    参加集会的人一致通过的决议指出，远东的危险局势是由于美国继续干涉中国的内政而造成的。
    决议说：“台湾、金门和马祖是中国的领土。有关这些岛屿的问题的解决，是中国人民的内政。任何外国干涉这一纠纷都只能导致紧张局势的加剧和最后导致战争。”
    决议还说：“为了远东和世界和平，十分重要的是，美国应该停止对中国内政的干涉，把它的部队撤出中国领海。”
    参加集会的人还送给英国首相麦克米伦一个请愿书，有四百人在这个请愿书上签了名。请愿书要求英国政府“坦率地宣布，美国部队驻在台湾海峡是战争威胁，英国绝不卷入这种战争。”
    集会由伦敦大学著名的核物理学家柏贺浦博士主持。工党上院议员帕提克—劳伦斯勋爵在集会上发言，他说，美国或任何其他国家的任何行动都不能改变这一事实：大陆上的政府得到六亿人民的支持，它是中国的唯一合法政府。
    他从历史方面证明台湾和沿海岛屿是属于中国的，并且要求恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。
    另一个发言的人博吉斯牧师强调指出，一直在台湾海峡集中大批武装部队的美国陆军和海军领袖，是今天世界上最危险的人物。
