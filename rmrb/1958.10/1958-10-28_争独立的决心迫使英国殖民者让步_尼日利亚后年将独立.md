Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch from London: After a long period of struggle by the Nigerian people, they have finally forced the British colonial authorities to agree that Nigeria will gain independence on October 1, 1960.

British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd yesterday announced the above decision, which the British government was forced to make, to the premiers of the Nigerian regions who came to London to negotiate with the British government authorities. The premiers of the Nigerian regions began this negotiation in London on September 29, seeking independence for the colony no later than April 2, 1960. During the three-week negotiations, the Nigerian representatives firmly demanded that Britain accept their demands. They stated that if Britain refused to resolve the issue peacefully, the more than 32 million residents of Nigeria would have to adopt all possible means, including force, in the struggle for independence.

In this negotiation, the British authorities continued to use their past tactics, attempting to sow discord among the representatives of the Nigerian regions on the one hand, and using these divisions as an excuse to refuse to set a date for Nigerian independence on the other. However, in the face of the unwavering determination of the Nigerian representatives to demand independence, its tricks finally had to fail.

Nigeria, located in West Africa, is the largest remaining British colony, with an area of 877,000 square kilometers, more than three times the size of the British mainland. It was occupied by Britain in 1861. For many years, the national independence movement in this colony has been very vigorous. On the eve of this London meeting, many British newspapers pointed out that if the British government continued to refuse Nigeria's demand for independence, Nigeria might become a serious "trouble spot" for British imperialism.

    争独立的决心迫使英国殖民者让步
    尼日利亚后年将独立
    新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：尼日利亚人民经过长期斗争之后，终于迫使英国殖民当局答应尼日利亚在1960年10月1日获得独立。
    英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德昨天向前来伦敦同英国政府当局谈判的尼日利亚各邦的总理宣布了英国政府不得不作出的上述决定。尼日利亚各邦的总理是为了要求最迟在1960年4月2日让这个殖民地独立，而在今年9月29日在伦敦开始同英国的这次谈判的。尼日利亚各邦的代表在三个多星期的谈判中，尼日利亚的代表们坚决要求英国接受他们的要求。他们表示，如果英国拒绝和平解决问题，尼日利亚的三千二百多万居民就不得不在争取独立的斗争中采用一切可能的手段，直到采用武力。
    英国当局在这次谈判中仍然沿用它过去惯用的手段，一方面企图在尼日利亚各邦的代表之间散布分歧，另一方面又以这些分歧为借口，拒绝确定给尼日利亚独立的日期。但是在尼日利亚代表们要求独立的不可动摇的决心面前，它的诡计终于不得不破产。
    尼日利亚在非洲西部，是英国目前残存的最大一块殖民地，面积八十七万七千平方公里，等于英国本土面积的三倍多。它是在1861年被英国占领的。多年以来，这个殖民地的民族独立运动非常蓬勃。在这次伦敦会谈前夕，英国许多报纸都指出，如果英国政府再拒绝尼日利亚的取得独立的要求，尼日利亚就可能成为英帝国主义的一个严重的“麻烦地点”。
