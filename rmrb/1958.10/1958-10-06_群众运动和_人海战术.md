    Mass Movements and "Human Wave Tactics"
    Wu Lü
    On September 29th, the steel front released a "big satellite" with a daily output of nearly 60,000 tons of steel and nearly 300,000 tons of pig iron. The event has passed, but the education that the "satellite" has given to the people is hard to forget for a long time. It is like a treasure trove of knowledge, from which people can explore many fundamental issues of leading industrial production.
    Speaking of the victory of this day, people say it is the victory of the mass movement. This is of course beyond doubt. Without 50 million people going to the front line and making a big effort in "small, indigenous, and mass" production, it would not have been possible to increase the daily steel output from more than 20,000 tons to nearly 60,000 tons, nor would it have been possible to increase the daily iron output from more than 40,000 tons to nearly 300,000 tons.
    In the eyes of some people, mass movements are nothing more than "human wave tactics." The implication is that this is not worth learning from. In fact, what's wrong with human wave tactics? We just have a large population, and when we do things, it's as magnificent and powerful as a tidal wave. Our people love the Communist Party and their government. Every call from the Party and the government is always quickly supported by the people and turned into practical actions. In Henan Province, when large-scale indigenous blast furnaces were being built, old ladies in their sixties and "Young Pioneers" in their teens wanted to go, and they couldn't be stopped or persuaded. May I ask: isn't such a mighty mass movement and "human wave tactic" a manifestation of revolutionary spirit?
    But it must also be said that mass movements are not just simple "human wave tactics." Just having a large number of people cannot solve all problems. The key issue is whether the leadership of the Party has been strengthened and whether politics has been put in command. If the leadership of the Party is relaxed and politics is not in command, although a lot of manpower can be concentrated, if the thinking is inconsistent and the will is not firm, there will still be no real mass movement. Mass movement is a revolutionary movement, and the soul of the mass movement is the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command. Only by strengthening the leadership of the Party and implementing political command can the revolutionary spirit of the people be promoted, and the wisdom and strength of millions of people be organized and gathered into a surging wave, moving forward courageously. Only such mass movements can repeatedly achieve great feats. Today's news in this newspaper about the daily steel output of Guxian County in Shanxi exceeding that of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant shows that strengthening the leadership of the Party and implementing political command are of decisive significance for enabling the mass movement of steel production to exert greater power and create more miracles. Compared with Taiyuan Iron and Steel, Guxian Iron and Steel Plant is far behind in terms of production equipment and technical strength. However, a small factory actually surpassed a large factory, which is not just a matter of production equipment and technical strength, but whether the mass political work is thorough.
    Generally speaking, at the beginning of the mass movement to vigorously develop steel, political mobilization and ideological work were usually grasped relatively tightly in many places. Many places organized debates such as "Do we need steel, can we produce steel?" and therefore effectively mobilized the masses. However, when the masses are mobilized and the movement gradually goes deeper, some comrades tend to neglect political and ideological work. Isn't it often heard that "the masses have been mobilized, and now the problem is to pass the technical barrier"? Are technical problems important? Yes, they are. But if we only grasp technical problems and do not continue to do political and ideological work, the technical barrier will not be passed either. Because technical problems always have to be solved by people, and how the millions of new hands next to the iron and steel furnaces recognize and treat their new lives has a direct impact on the solution of various problems in production, including technical problems. Whoever cannot see this cannot do the work well and cannot exert the power of the mass movement.
    It can be seen that the reason why the mass movement is so powerful is not only because of "human wave tactics"; more importantly, it lies in the leadership of the Party and putting politics in command. This is one of the main lessons we should learn from the launch of the steel "big satellite".

    群众运动和“人海战术”
    吴滤
    9月29日，钢铁战线放出日产钢近六万吨，生铁近三十万吨的“大卫星”。事情是过去了，而“卫星”给予人们的教育，却是久久也难以忘怀。它仿佛是一个知识的宝囊，人们可以从中探索许多领导工业生产的根本问题。
    谈起这一天的胜利，人们都说是群众运动的胜利。这当然是毫无疑义的。没有五千万人开赴前线，大闹“小、土、群”，就不可能使钢的日产量一下子从二万多吨跃到近六万吨，也不可能使铁的日产量一下子从四万多吨跃到近三十万吨。
    在有些人看来，群众运动者，不过是“人海战术”也。言下大有不足为训的味道。其实，人海战术又有什么不好的呢？我们就是人多，办起事情来就是像海潮一样波澜壮阔，声势浩大。我们的人民热爱共产党，热爱自己的政府。党和政府的每一个号召，总是迅速得到人民群众的拥护，变为人民群众的实际行动。河南省大搞土高炉，六十多岁的老太太也要去，十几岁的“红领巾”也要去，劝也劝不止，拦也拦不住。试问：这样浩浩荡荡的群众运动和“人海战术”不正是革命气势的表现吗？
    话也得说回来，群众运动并不只是简单的“人海战术”。光是人多，并不能解决一切问题。关键问题就在于是不是加强了党的领导，是不是政治挂帅。放松了党的领导，政治没有挂帅，虽然也能集中很多人力，但思想不一致，意志不坚定，总还是不会有真正的群众运动的。群众运动是革命运动，群众运动的灵魂是党的领导、政治挂帅。只有加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，才能发扬人民群众的革命精神，把千百万人民群众的智慧和力量组织起来，汇成滔滔的海浪，勇往直前。这样的群众运动才能屡建奇功。今天本报发表的山西故县钢的日产量超过太原钢铁厂的新闻，都说明了加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，对于使钢铁生产的群众运动发挥更大的威力，创造更多的奇迹，具有决定性的意义。故县钢铁厂和太钢相比，无论生产设备和技术力量都是相差很远的。然而，一个小厂居然赶过了大厂，这就不仅仅是生产设备和技术力量问题，而是群众政治工作是否深透了。
    一般地说，在大办钢铁的群众运动开展之初，政治动员，许多地方对于思想工作通常都是抓得比较紧的，许多地方组织过“要不要钢铁，能不能办钢铁”之类的辩论，因而确有成效地动员了群众。但是，在群众发动起来，运动逐步走向深入的时候，有些同志就容易忽视政治思想工作。不是常听到这样的说法吗？“群众已经发动起来了，现在的问题是要过技术关”。技术问题重要不重要呢？重要。但如果只抓技术问题，不继续做政治思想工作，技术关也是过不去的。因为技术问题总要人去解决，千百万炼铁炉和炼钢炉旁的新手，怎样认识和怎样对待新的生活，对于生产中各种问题，包括技术问题的解决，都有着直接的影响。谁要是看不到这一点，谁就不可能把工作做好，不可能发挥群众运动的威力。
    可见，群众运动所以威力巨大，不只是“人海战术”的缘故；更重要的，还在于党的领导，政治挂帅。这是我们从钢铁“大卫星”上天中应该吸取的主要经验之一。
