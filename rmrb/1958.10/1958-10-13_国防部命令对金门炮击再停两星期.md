Beneficial to Chinese in Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu, Beneficial to the Entire Nation, Unfavorable to Americans
Ministry of National Defense Orders Another Two-Week Suspension of Bombardment of Quemoy
To make the majority of Chinese in Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu aware and isolate a few traitors. While the Taiwan authorities refuse peace talks, our army has the right to strike or stop as it sees fit. The complete recovery of Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu is the sacred task of the Chinese people, is China's internal affair, and foreigners and the United Nations have no right to interfere. The Americans staying in Taiwan must go back. All aggressors and their running dogs will not be buried for long.

Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: The order of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China is as follows: To the People's Liberation Army comrades on the Fujian Front:
    The bombardment of Quemoy will be suspended for another two weeks from today, in order to observe the enemy's movements and to allow the military and civilians in Quemoy to receive sufficient supplies, including food and military equipment, to facilitate their defense. Deception is permissible in war, but this is not deception. This is to deal with the Americans. This is a matter of national righteousness, and the boundary between China and the United States must be clearly distinguished. Our doing so, in terms of the overall situation, does not harm ourselves but benefits others. Who does it benefit? It benefits the ten million Chinese in Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu, and it benefits the 650 million people of the entire nation; it is only unfavorable to the Americans. Some communists may not yet understand this principle temporarily. How could such an idea be proposed? Don't understand, don't understand! Comrades, you will understand in a moment. The Americans staying in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait must go back. They have no reason to stay here, and they must leave. Among the Chinese in Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu, there are more patriots and fewer traitors. Therefore, it is necessary to do political work to gradually make the majority of Chinese there aware and isolate a few traitors. Over time, the results will be seen. Until the Kuomintang in Taiwan holds peace talks with us and reaches a reasonable solution, the civil war still exists. The spokesman for Taiwan said: Stopping and starting, starting and stopping, is just a communist trick. Stopping and starting is indeed the case, but it is not a trick. If you don't want peace talks, fighting is inevitable. While you adopt this stubborn attitude, we have the freedom to strike or stop as we see fit. The Americans want to interfere in our country's internal war issue, they call it a ceasefire, which is laughable. What qualifications do the Americans have to talk about this issue? Who do they represent? They represent nothing. Do they represent the Americans? China and the United States are not at war, there is no fire to stop. Do they represent the Taiwanese? The Taiwan authorities have not issued them a mandate, and the Kuomintang leaders fundamentally oppose Sino-American talks. The American nation is a great nation, and its people are kind. They do not want war and welcome peace. But some of the American government's staff, such as Dulles and his like, are really not very clever. Even the so-called ceasefire is simply lacking in common sense. The complete recovery of Taiwan, Penghu, Quemoy, and Matsu, and the completion of the reunification of the motherland, is the sacred task of our 650 million people. This is China's internal affair, and foreigners have no right to interfere, and the United Nations also has no right to interfere. All aggressors and their running dogs in the world will all be buried, and the time will not be far off. They will definitely not escape. They can't even hide on the moon. If the enemy can go, so can we, and we can always catch them back. In a word, victory belongs to the people of the world. In the waters of Quemoy, Americans are not allowed to escort ships. If there is an escort, open fire immediately. Strictly follow this order!

    有益于台澎金马中国人，有益于全民族，不利于美国人
    国防部命令对金门炮击再停两星期
    要使台澎金马大多数中国人觉悟过来，孤立少数卖国贼。在台湾当局拒绝和谈期间，我军有权要打就打，要停就停。整个地收复台澎金马是中国人民的神圣任务，是中国的内政，外人和联合国都无权过问。呆在台湾的美国人必须滚回去。一切侵略者及其走狗不会很久都要被埋葬掉。
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国国防部命令，全文如下：中华人民共和国国防部命令福建前线人民解放军同志们：
    金门炮击，从本日起，再停两星期，借以观察敌方动态，并使金门军民同胞得到充分补给，包括粮食和军事装备在内，以利他们固守。兵不厌诈，这不是诈。这是为了对付美国人的。这是民族大义，必须把中美界限分得清清楚楚。我们这样做，就全局说来，无损于己，有益于人。有益于什么人呢？有益于台、澎、金、马一千万中国人，有益于全民族六亿五千万人，就是不利于美国人。有些共产党人可能暂时还不理解这个道理。怎么打出这样一个主意呢？不懂，不懂！同志们，过一会儿，你们会懂的。呆在台湾和台湾海峡的美国人，必须滚回去。他们赖在这里是没有理由的，不走是不行的。台、澎、金、马的中国人中，爱国的多，卖国的少。因此要做政治工作，使那里大多数的中国人逐步觉悟过来，孤立少数卖国贼。积以时日，成效自见。在台湾国民党没有同我们举行和平谈判并且获得合理解决以前，内战依然存在。台湾的发言人说：停停打打，打打停停，不过是共产党的一条诡计。停停打打，确是如此，但非诡计。你们不要和谈，打是免不了的。在你们采取现在这种顽固态度期间，我们是有自由权的，要打就打，要停就停。美国人想在我国的内战问题上插进一只手来，他们叫做停火，令人忍俊不禁。美国人有什么资格谈这个问题呢？请问他们代表什么人？什么也不代表。他们代表美国人吗？中美两国没有开战，无火可停。他们代表台湾人吗？台湾当局没有发给他们委任状，国民党领袖根本反对中美会谈。美国民族是一个伟大的民族，其人民是善良的。他们不要战争，欢迎和平。但是美国政府的工作人员，有一部分，例如杜勒斯之流，实在不大高明。即如所谓停火一说，岂非缺乏常识？台、澎、金、马整个地收复回来，完成祖国统一，这是我们六亿五千万人民的神圣任务。这是中国内政，外人无权过问，联合国也无权过问。世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。他们一定逃不掉的。他们想躲到月球里去也不行。寇能往，我亦能往，总是可以抓回来的。一句话，胜利是全世界人民的。金门海域，美国人不得护航。如有护航，立即开炮。切切此令！
