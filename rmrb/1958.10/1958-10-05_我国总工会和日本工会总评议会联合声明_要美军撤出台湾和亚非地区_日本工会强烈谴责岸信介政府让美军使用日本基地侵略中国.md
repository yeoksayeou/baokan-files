Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The full text of the joint statement between the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is as follows:

    The delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan visited the People's Republic of China to participate in the celebration of the 1958 National Day of the People's Republic of China. During the visit, it held friendly talks with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the issue of military intervention by American war provocateurs in the Taiwan region and the friendly unity between Chinese and Japanese workers and trade unions, and basically reached the following consensus.

    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan believes that the United States' armed occupation of Taiwan, which has always been Chinese territory, and the concentration of large numbers of troops in the Taiwan Strait area to carry out armed intervention and war provocations, obstructing China's liberation of Taiwan and the recovery of inland islands, is clearly a serious interference in China's internal affairs; at the same time, it is also the root cause of the continuous creation of tension in Asia and the threat and destruction of peace in Asia and the Far East. Japanese workers express serious protests against the aggressive military actions of American war provocateurs and demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. They demand that the current United Nations General Assembly restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions welcomes these demands of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and thanks the Japanese workers for their support of the Chinese people's just struggle.

    The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan strongly condemns the Kishi Nobusuke government for allowing the US military to use military bases in Japan to assist the United States in its aggression against China. It points out that the Kishi Nobusuke government is using the tension in the Far East to transport nuclear weapons into Japan for nuclear armament, which is an attempt to establish a "military alliance" between Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek. In order to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy, the Kishi Nobusuke government is implementing the "performance rating" system and other measures domestically, illegally suppressing the trade union movement and depriving workers of their rights. This is clearly a forced implementation of various anti-democratic policies. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan demands that the Japanese government: abolishe the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and the "Japan-Chiang Treaty," refuse the US military's use of military bases in Japan and Okinawa, and immediately cease its hostile policy towards China. It calls on Japanese workers and people to launch a broad movement and struggle to force the Kishi Nobusuke government to comprehensively change its policies and promote the normalization of relations between Japan and China. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the struggle of Japanese workers and people for national independence, democratic freedom, Sino-Japanese friendship, and the normalization of relations between the two countries, and firmly believes that the struggle of Japanese workers and people will overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous development and victory.

    Both sides unanimously believe that the United States' creation of tension in the Taiwan Strait area is a serious threat to peace in Asia, and also a violation of the independence and sovereignty of Asian and African nations. The demand that US troops immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, withdraw from Okinawa and the Japanese mainland, withdraw from Lebanon and the Middle East, and withdraw from all Afro-Asian regions is the common desire of workers and people in Asian and African countries. We suggest that all trade union organizations in Asia and Africa immediately launch mutual support and joint actions to oppose war and defend peace, thereby strengthening the unity of workers and trade union organizations in Asia and Africa.

    Based on the common aspirations of Chinese and Japanese workers, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will continue to develop friendly exchanges between the workers and trade union organizations of the two countries on the basis of the existing friendship between the Chinese and Japanese workers and trade union organizations, and work together to eliminate man-made obstacles to the normalization of relations between China and Japan, and contribute to the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and peace in Asia and the world.

    我国总工会和日本工会总评议会联合声明
    要美军撤出台湾和亚非地区
    日本工会强烈谴责岸信介政府让美军使用日本基地侵略中国
    新华社4日讯　中华全国总工会同日本工会总评议会的联合声明，全文如下：
    日本工会总评议会代表团，为了参加1958年中华人民共和国国庆节，访问了中华人民共和国。在访问期间，同中华全国总工会，就美国战争挑衅者在台湾地区的军事干涉问题，以及中日两国工人和工会之间友好团结的问题，举行了友好会谈，基本上取得了如下的一致意见。
    日本工会总评议会认为，美国用武力霸占从来就是中国领土的台湾，并且集中大量兵力在台湾海峡地区进行武装干涉和战争挑衅、阻挠中国解放台湾和收复内海岛屿，显然，是对中国内政的严重干涉；同时也是不断造成亚洲紧张局势，威胁、破坏亚洲和远东和平的根本原因。日本工人对美国战争挑衅者的侵略性军事行动表示严重的抗议，要求美军立即从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤退。要求本届联合国大会恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。中华全国总工会对日本工会总评议会的这些主张表示欢迎，并感谢日本工人给予中国人民正义斗争的支持。
    日本工会总评议会对岸信介政府让美国军队使用在日本的军事基地，协助美国对中国进行侵略，进行强烈的谴责，并指出岸信介政府利用远东紧张局势，把核武器运进日本进行核武装，是企图建立日本、李承晚、蒋介石“军事同盟”的阴谋。岸信介政府为了实现上述阴谋，在国内实行“勤务评定”制度等，非法镇压工会运动和剥夺工人的权利，这显然是强制推行各种反民主的政策。日本工会总评议会要求日本政府：废除日美“安全保障条约”和“日蒋条约”，拒绝美军利用日本和冲绳的军事基地，立即停止敌视中国的政策。并号召日本工人和人民展开广泛的运动和斗争，迫使岸信介政府全面地改变政策，促进日中两国邦交正常化。中华全国总工会完全支持日本工人和人民要求民族独立、民主自由和中日友好以及两国邦交正常化的斗争，并深信日本工人和人民的斗争将克服各种困难获得不断的发展和胜利。
    双方一致认为：美国在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，是对于亚洲和平的严重威胁；也是对亚非各民族独立和主权的侵犯。要求美军立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区，撤出冲绳和日本本土，撤出黎巴嫩和中东，撤出一切亚非地区，这是亚非各国工人和人民的共同愿望。我们建议：亚非一切工会组织立即展开相互支援和联合行动，反对战争，保卫和平，从而加强亚非工人和工会组织的团结。
    中华全国总工会和日本工会总评议会，根据中国工人和日本工人的共同愿望，在中日两国工人和工会组织已有的友好基础上，将继续发展两国工人和工会之间的友好来往，为了排除中日两国关系正常化的人为障碍而共同努力。并且为中日两国人民的友好、中日邦交的恢复和亚洲及世界和平作出贡献。
