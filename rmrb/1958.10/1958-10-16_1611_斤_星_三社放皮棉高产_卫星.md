    “Star” Third Cooperative Launches High-Yield Cotton "Satellite"
    (Our Newspaper) News: The "Star" Third Cooperative of Jiedu Township, Leping County, Jiangxi Province, launched a cotton "satellite": 2.45 mu of cotton land actually harvested 10,857.7 jin of seed cotton, with an average yield of 4,431.10 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to 1,611.2 jin of lint cotton, an increase of more than twenty times compared to last year. The variety used in this cotton field was "Dai Zi Cotton No. 15." This field was planted with sugarcane last year. This year, after being converted to cotton, high yields were achieved due to comprehensive technical measures such as deep plowing and close planting, layered fertilization, sufficient base fertilizer, sowing half a month earlier than last year, inter-row cultivation and weeding, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. This field was plowed a total of ten times, from the original three inches deep to one chi. When deep plowing, it was combined with sufficient base fertilizer, applying fertilizer one layer for each plowing. Finally, a layer of pond mud with a thickness of more than one inch was spread on the topsoil, making the soil loose and resistant to drought. It was not damaged even without rain for more than 100 days. (Tang Zhiguang, Li Fuqing, etc.)
    (Our Newspaper) News: Duomei Township, Heqing County, Yunnan Province, created a high-yield record of 1,375 jin of lint cotton per mu. The Zhonghe Cooperative of Duomei Township harvested a total of 4,775 jin of seed cotton from 1.16 mu of cotton land, equivalent to 1,375 jin of lint cotton per mu, exceeding the township's previous highest yield by more than 34 times. The cotton bolls in this field were full, with the largest having 126 cotton bolls, and the average having 48 to 60 cotton bolls. On September 22, the Dali Prefectural Committee inspection team personally went to the township for inspection and acceptance.

    1611斤
    “星”三社放皮棉高产“卫星”
    本报讯　江西乐平县接渡乡“星”三社发射出一颗棉花“卫星”：二亩四分五厘棉地实收籽棉一万零八百五十七斤七两，平均亩产籽棉四千四百三十一斤十两，合皮棉一千六百十一斤二两，比去年增产二十倍以上。这块棉田用的品种是“岱字棉十五号”。这块田去年种的是甘蔗，今年改种棉花后，由于采取了深耕密植，分层施肥，施足底肥，比去年提早半月播种，中耕锄草，防治病虫害等综合性的技术措施，获得了高产纪录。这块田共翻耕了十次，由原来的三寸深耕到一尺。深耕时，结合施足底肥，每耕一次，施肥一层，最后在表土上铺一层厚达一寸余的塘泥，使土壤松，抗旱力强，一百多天没有下雨也没受到损害。（汤之光、李福庆等）
