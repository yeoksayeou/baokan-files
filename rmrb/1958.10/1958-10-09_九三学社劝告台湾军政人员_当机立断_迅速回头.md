Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The central committee members and some leading comrades of the Jiusan Society in Beijing held a forum on the afternoon of the 7th, unanimously expressing their support for Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to the Taiwan compatriots.

Everyone believes that the letter to the Taiwan compatriots fully expresses the deep concern of the mainland compatriots for the military and civilians of Taiwan, and also fully meets the requirements and wishes of the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The proclamation powerfully exposed the conspiracy of the American imperialists to create "two Chinas," and also pointed out the danger that the Chiang Kai-shek clique would sooner or later be abandoned by the American imperialists.

Chinese people not fighting Chinese people is the traditional belief of our people. Today, the American imperialists' crimes of aggression in dealing with colonial countries all over the world and in the Taiwan Strait region are well known. They are the common enemy of our compatriots across the country. Any Chinese with a little national sentiment and patriotism, as long as they recall the historical lessons, will surely wake up, stop the civil war, and unite against foreign enemies.

The letter to Taiwan compatriots not only points out that the American aggressors are already in an extremely isolated and passive situation, but also points out that there are only two paths before the Chiang Kai-shek clique: one is to stubbornly resist relying on American imperialism, the result of which is a dead end; the other is to hold negotiations and implement a peaceful resolution, which is the only bright future.

Everyone unanimously believes that the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Chinese people have fought a thirty-year civil war. History has already proven that the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which insists on being the enemy of the people, has reached the point of final destruction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Currently, in the cause of socialist construction, they are creating unprecedented miracles at a speed of "one day equaling twenty years." This is a great happy event that is rejoiced by peace-loving people all over the world and all Chinese people. Under such circumstances, the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan should make a decisive decision, quickly turn back, unite against foreign enemies, and drive the American robbers out of the sacred territory of the motherland.

    拥护彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书
    九三学社劝告台湾军政人员
    当机立断　迅速回头
    新华社8日讯　九三学社在京中央委员和一部分领导同志，7日下午举行的座谈会上，对彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书一致表示拥护。
    大家认为：告台湾同胞书充分表达了大陆同胞对台湾军民的深切关怀，同时也完全符合台、澎、金、马同胞的要求和愿望。文告有力地戳穿了美帝国主义者制造“两个中国”的阴谋，同时也指出了蒋介石集团迟早要被美帝国主义者抛弃的危险。
    中国人不打中国人是我国人民的传统信念，今天美帝国主义者在对待全世界殖民地国家以及在台湾海峡地区的侵略罪行，已为众所周知，它是我们全国同胞当前的共同敌人，凡是稍有民族感和爱国心的中国人，只要回忆一下历史教训，一定会幡然悔悟，停止内战，一致对外。
    告台湾同胞书不仅指出了美国侵略者已经陷于极端孤立和被动的处境，同时也指出了摆在蒋介石集团面前只有两条道路：一条是依附美帝国主义负隅顽抗，结果就是死路一条；一条是举行谈判，实行和平解决，才是唯一光明的前途。
    大家一致认为蒋介石集团和中国人民打了三十年的内战，历史已经作了证明，坚持与人民为敌的蒋介石集团已经走到最后灭亡的境地。而中国人民在共产党的领导下，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，目前在社会主义建设事业中正以“一天等于二十年”的速度，创造了史无前例的奇迹。这是全世界爱好和平的人民和全中国人民所欢欣鼓舞的大喜事。在这样的形势下，台湾国民党军政人员应该当机立断，迅速回头，一致对外，把美国强盗从祖国的神圣领土上赶出去。
