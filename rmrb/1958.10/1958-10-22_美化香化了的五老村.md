The Beautified and Fragrant Wulao Village
By our reporter Xu Wen

I recently visited Wulao Village in Nanjing City, a national model of special-grade sanitation. For several years, they have been a model unit with a red flag that never falls. Recently, they have further beautified their homes on the basis of paying attention to hygiene.

As soon as I entered the village, it was like entering a newly built park. The weeping willows at the entrance of the village were already taller than the eaves of the houses, and the curved branches hung down in all directions, like an umbrella covering the archway of Wulao Village. The newly planted poplars on the roadside had already grown lush green leaves, which were reflected on the smooth road by the rising sun, forming a beautiful printed carpet. Between the trees on the roadside, in front of and behind the houses of each family, there were clusters of various seasonal flowers blooming, emitting a refreshing fragrance.

In recent years, the regular patriotic health campaign has greatly changed the environmental sanitation of Wulao Village. On the basis of jointly improving sanitation, people have continuously developed the communist ideology of "one for all, all for one." Everyone regards helping others and doing public things as doing things for themselves. They know that no matter whose family it is, as long as a pest is left behind, everyone will suffer. At the end of last year, the whole village worked hard for sixty days and nights to eliminate the four pests. Immediately afterwards, they actively engaged in the work of transforming the old homeland and beautifying the environment.

When I went to Wulao Village, the whole village had been working day and night for more than a month. The carpenters and bricklayers in the village went out to work during the day and returned to participate in the work of transforming their homes in the evening. Vendors Wu Shanfu and Wu Shanbao sold yuanxiao and steamed rice in the morning, and immediately participated in building road edges after the market closed. Workers with flatbed carts, rickshaws, and tricycles always dragged a cart of mud or bricks back from outside the city each time they went. The elderly couple Chao Jiangong dragged a flatbed cart. Once, it rained heavily, and they dragged a cart of mud back from outside the city. The rain poured down on their heads, but they still said happily: "This cart of mud can increase the height of the wall by five inches." The woman Dong Aihua, who was thin, seemed like a Hercules, rushing to do heavy work everywhere. A bamboo basket weighing more than two hundred catties, which others carried one by one, she carried two baskets at a time. People did not allow the elderly over seventy years old to participate in the labor, so they organized tea stations to supply tea to everyone. The whole village renovated five new roads, with a total length of 441 meters, all of which were compacted with rammed earth and covered with cinder. More than 25,000 city bricks transported from outside the city were used to build road edges on both sides. During the road construction, more than 370 meters of new sewers were laid, and the original houses were rebuilt. The walls were painted and renewed, and many murals were painted and wall poems created by the masses themselves were written on them. The ditches that used to dump sewage and accumulate foul water have now been filled and transformed into small gardens, planted with more than 48,000 various flowers, plants and trees. All of these were done by the masses themselves. In about 20 days, the whole village mobilized more than 117,000 person-times.

Now, in the small garden in front of the Wulao Village Kindergarten, hundreds of flowers are in full bloom, and morning glories have climbed onto the newly built trellis. The little goldfish in the goldfish pond swim so happily. In the morning, the young children in the kindergarten put their hands around each other, one following the other to form a train carriage, making "clattering" sounds to imitate the sound of the machine, saying that they were taking the train to the garden to see the goldfish. More than thirty children surrounded the goldfish pond and shouted, "Good morning, goldfish," "Hello, goldfish," and not a single child threw debris into the goldfish pond. The water in the goldfish pond was crystal clear. Many children play in the garden every day, some watching the goldfish, some climbing the artificial hills, and some playing games in the pavilion, but no child picks a flower. There are so many flowers, plants, and trees in the whole village, and there is no full-time manager, but no flower or tree has ever lacked water. On sunny days, around 9:00 in the morning, you can see many people watering the flowers; after 3:00 in the afternoon, people are cleaning and sweeping in front of the flowers and under the trees. If a leaf falls, someone will quickly pick it up. Young people, white-haired old people, and children about the same height as the flower branches are doing these things. They are assigned to manage the flowers, plants, and trees in front of their homes, but if someone is away, the neighbors automatically take responsibility for management, so the survival rate of the flowers, plants, and trees here is almost 100%.

In Wulao Village, every household is clean and hygienic, and everyone is healthy. There are no acute infectious diseases in the whole village. Now, the whole village is beautified. People live in this beautiful place, with flowers in front of the door, trees on the roadside, poems and paintings on the walls, no idle people in every household, and everyone has something to do. Everyone is working hard for a happy and beautiful communist tomorrow. People call this place "Happy Village." (Attached picture)

### 美化香化了的五老村

    美化香化了的五老村
    本报记者　徐文
    我最近访问了全国特等卫生模范——南京市五老村。几年来，他们一直是个红旗不倒的模范单位。最近，他们又在讲卫生的基础上，进一步美化家园。
    一进村，我像到了一座新建的公园一样。村头的垂柳，已经高过屋檐，弯弯的柳枝，向四面下垂着，像一座伞盖，复盖在五老村的牌楼上。路边新栽不久的白杨，已经长出翠绿的大叶，被初升的太阳映照在平整的马路上，成了一层美丽的印花地毯。路边的树与树之间，各家的宅前屋后，都有一丛丛的各种四季盛开的鲜花，清香袭人。
    近几年来，经常化的爱国卫生工作，大大改变了五老村的环境卫生状况。在共同搞好卫生工作的基础上，人们不断成长着“我为人人、人人为我”的共产主义思想。大家对于帮助别人和做公共的事情，都看成替自己做事一样，他们知道，不问谁家，只要留下一个害虫，大家就都得受害。去年年底，全村的人苦战了六十个昼夜，除尽了四害。紧接着，他们又积极从事改造旧家园和美化环境的工作。
    我去五老村的时候，全村的人已经日日夜夜地干了一个多月。村内的木工、瓦工，白天出去上工，晚上回来参加改造家园的工作。小贩吴善富、吴善宝早晨卖元宵、蒸饭，下市后立即参加砌路芽。板车、人力车、三轮车工人，每次去城外，总要拖一车泥或一车砖回来。晁建功老夫妇两人拖一辆板车，有一次下大雨，从城外拖了一车泥回来，雨水顺头淋，他们还乐呵呵地说：“这车泥，可以使墙头增高五寸。”妇女董爱华，瘦瘦的个子，但她好像一个大力士，到处抢重活干，二百多斤重的一个箩筐，人家一筐一筐抬，她一次挑两筐。人们不让七十多岁的老人参加劳动，她们组织茶水站，给大家供应茶水。全村的人翻修了五条新马路，全长共计四百四十一公尺，全部用三合土夯实，上面铺了煤渣，两旁用从城外运来的二万五千多块城砖砌起了路芽。在修路中，新铺了三百七十多公尺的下水道，改建了原有的房屋。墙头经过粉刷，焕然一新，并且绘了许多壁画，写上了群众自己创作的墙头诗。原来倒污垢、积臭水的沟塘，现在都已填平，改建成小花园，栽植了各种花草树木四万八千多株。所有这些，都是群众自己动手，二十天左右的时间，全村出动了十一万七千多人次。
    现在，五老村幼儿园门前的小花园里，百花盛开，牵牛花已经爬上了新搭的棚架。金鱼池里的小金鱼游得那么欢畅。早晨，幼儿园的小班幼儿们，一个个把两手环抱，一个跟着一个地组成列车车厢模样，嘴里“咯打咯打”地学着机器的响声，说是开火车到花园看金鱼来了。三十多个小朋友，围在金鱼池边喊：“金鱼早”、“金鱼好”，没有一个孩子向金鱼池内丢掷杂物。金鱼池内的水，清澈见底。每天到花园里玩的孩子很多，有的看金鱼，有的爬假山，也有的在凉亭上做游戏，但没有一个儿童摘一朵花。全村这么多花草树木，没有一个专职管理的人，但从来没有一枝花一棵树缺过水。晴天，上午九时左右，就可以看到许多人在花前浇水；下午三时以后，人们又在花前、树下清理打扫。掉下一片树叶，很快就有人把它拾掉。做这些事情，有青年人，有白发老人，也有同花枝差不多高的儿童。他们分工每人管理各家门前的花草树木，但是如果有人外出了，邻居就自动地来负责管理，所以这儿的花草树木的成活率，几乎是百分之百。
    在五老村，家家清洁卫生，人人身体健康，全村已经没有什么急性传染病。现在，全村美化，人们生活在这美丽的地方，门前有花，路边有树，墙头有诗画，户户没闲人，人人有事做，大家都为共产主义幸福美好的明天而努力。人们都把这儿称为“欢乐村”。（附图片）
