Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th. Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, Qiao Xiaoguang, held a banquet tonight for the Chinese People's Delegation's visit to North Korea.

Guests attending the banquet included Korean Vice Premiers Kim Il, Hong Myong-hui, Nam Il, and Lee Joo-yeon; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chol, and Kim Chang-man; Minister of National Defense General Kim Kwang-hyup; and Chairman of the Korea-China Friendship Association, Ha Ang-cheon. Foreign envoys to North Korea also attended the banquet.

Ambassador Qiao Xiaoguang delivered a speech at the banquet first. He said that the Chinese People's Delegation participated in the activities of the "Korea-China Friendship Month," which marks the further consolidation and development of the great friendship between the people of China and Korea. The holding of the "Korea-China Friendship Month" is a further development of the profound friendship of the heroic Korean people towards the Chinese People's Volunteers and the entire Chinese people.

Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, said in his speech at the banquet that on behalf of the Anti-American and Aid-Korea General Association and the 650 million Chinese people, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Korean people for their care for the Chinese People's Volunteers.

He said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people have not only won the war, but also won peace. You are standing on the front line of defending peace in Asia and the world. In the past few years, you have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction and have made great contributions to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. He said that the achievements of the Korean brothers are our achievements, the achievements of the entire socialist camp. We, the Chinese people, are proud to have such close comrades-in-arms as the Korean people.

Guo Moruo said that we will leave you tomorrow and return to China. We will widely convey to the Chinese people the grand activities of your "Korea-China Friendship Month." In particular, your high degree of patriotism and internationalism is an example for the Chinese people. All of us Chinese people must learn from you, so that our common cause can move from one great victory to an even greater victory!

Korean Vice Premier Hong Myong-hui said in his speech at the banquet that the visit of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has made a valuable contribution to further strengthening the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea. He pointed out the great significance of the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea for the prosperity and development of the two countries and for maintaining peace in the Far East.

Hong Myong-hui said that today, when the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from North Korea, the US imperialists not only do not withdraw from South Korea, but are frantically turning South Korea into their missile and atomic war base, and continue to carry out aggressive acts against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait.

He emphasized that if the US imperialists disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, and dare to continue aggressive and provocative acts against the Chinese people, they will inevitably suffer greater and more miserable defeats.

Hong Myong-hui said that the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people infinitely inspires the Korean people to advance along the socialist road with the spirit of Chollima. In order to complete socialist construction ahead of schedule, the Korean people have already started a leap forward in various departments. There is no doubt that the people of Korea and China will be able to climb to the peak of the communist society that can be seen in the near future. He said that the Korean people are proud to have such reliable and close friends as the Chinese people, and we, the Korean people, will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people.

The banquet was held in a friendly and warm atmosphere from beginning to end.

    新华社平壤25日电　中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光今天晚上为中国人民代表团访问朝鲜举行宴会。
    参加宴会的来宾有朝鲜内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，民族保卫相金光侠大将，朝中友好协会委员长河仰天等。各国驻朝鲜使节也参加了宴会。
    乔晓光大使首先在宴会上致词。他说，中国人民代表团参加了标志着中朝两国人民的伟大友谊进一步巩固和发展的“朝中友好月”的活动。“朝中友好月”的举行，是英雄的朝鲜人民对于中国人民志愿军和全体中国人民的深厚友谊的进一步发展。
    中国人民代表团团长郭沫若在宴会上致词时，代表抗美援朝总会和六亿五千万中国人民，对于朝鲜人民给予中国人民志愿军的爱护，向朝鲜人民表示衷心的感谢。
    他说，英雄的朝鲜人民在以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导之下，不仅赢得了战争，而且赢得了和平。你们是站在保卫亚洲和世界和平的最前线，几年来你们对于社会主义建设事业有了辉煌的成就，对于保卫亚洲和世界和平事业有了巨大的贡献。他说，朝鲜兄弟的成就就是我们的成就，就是整个社会主义阵营的成就，我们中国人民以有着朝鲜人民这样最亲密的战友而感到自豪。
    郭沫若说，我们明天就要离开你们回到中国去了。我们要把你们的“朝中友好月”的盛大活动向中国人民作广泛的传达。特别是你们的高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神是我们中国人民的榜样，我们全中国人民一定要向你们看齐，好让我们的共同事业能够由一个伟大的胜利走向一个更伟大的胜利！

    洪命熹说，在中国人民志愿军完全撤离朝鲜的今天，美帝国主义者不仅不撤出南朝鲜，而且正在疯狂的把南朝鲜变为它的导弹和原子战争基地，并且在台湾海峡继续进行反对中国人民的侵略行为。
    他强调说，如果美帝国主义者不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的多次警告，胆敢继续进行反对中国人民的侵略性的挑衅行为，那么它必将遭到更大的惨败。
    洪命熹说，中国人民的大跃进，无限鼓舞朝鲜人民以千里马的气概沿着社会主义大道前进。朝鲜人民为了提前完成社会主义建设，已经在各个部门开始了飞跃的前进。毫无疑问，朝中两国人民在不久的将来就可以攀上望得见共产主义社会的高峰。他说，朝鲜人民为有中国人民这样可依靠的亲密的朋友而感到自豪，我们朝鲜人民将同中国人民永远并肩前进。
    宴会始终在友好热烈的气氛中进行。
