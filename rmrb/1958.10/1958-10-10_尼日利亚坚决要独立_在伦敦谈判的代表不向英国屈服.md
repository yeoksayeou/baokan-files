Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th (TASS): The negotiations in London between the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd and representatives of Nigeria, Britain's largest colony in Africa, have entered their second week. The Nigerian representatives include the premiers of Nigeria's major provinces and the Federal Prime Minister of Nigeria, Tafawa Balewa. The central issue of the negotiations is the demand by various Nigerian political parties and social organizations that the colony be granted independence no later than April 2, 1960.

The Nigerian representatives participating in the London negotiations have demonstrated an unwavering determination to have Britain accept this demand. During the negotiations, the Nigerian representatives have clearly indicated to the British Colonial Secretary that if Britain refuses to resolve the issue peacefully, the colony's more than 33 million residents will have no choice but to adopt all possible means in the struggle for independence, even to the point of using force.

Faced with this demand, the British authorities are employing their usual policy: on the one hand, they are attempting to sow discord among the politicians of the various Nigerian regions; on the other hand, they claim that as long as these divisions are not eliminated, the question of Nigerian independence cannot be finally resolved.

    尼日利亚坚决要独立
    在伦敦谈判的代表不向英国屈服
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社伦敦8日讯：英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德同英国在非洲最大的殖民地尼日利亚代表在伦敦的谈判已经进入第二周。尼日利亚的代表包括尼日利亚各主要省的总理、尼日利亚联邦总理塔法瓦·巴勒瓦。谈判的中心问题是尼日利亚各政党和社会团体要求最迟在1960年4月2日给予这个殖民地以独立。
    参加伦敦谈判的尼日利亚代表表现出不可动摇的决心，要英国接受这个要求。在谈判的过程中，尼日利亚代表明显地向英国殖民地大臣表示，如果英国拒绝和平解决问题，殖民地三千三百多万居民就将不得不在争取独立的斗争中采用一切可能的手段，直到采用武力。
    英国当局在这种要求的面前采用它的惯用的政策：它一方面企图在尼日利亚各地区政治家之间散布分歧，另一方面又说，这些分歧一天不消除，关于尼日利亚独立的问题就一天不能最后解决。
