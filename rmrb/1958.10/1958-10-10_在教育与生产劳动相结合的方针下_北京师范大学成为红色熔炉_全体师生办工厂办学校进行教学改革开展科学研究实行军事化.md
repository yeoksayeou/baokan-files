    Under the Guideline of Combining Education with Productive Labor
    Beijing Normal University Becomes a Red Furnace
    All Teachers and Students Run Factories and Schools, Conduct Teaching Reform, Carry Out Scientific Research, and Implement Militarization
    (Our Dispatch) Beijing Normal University is implementing the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, putting politics in command, and creating a new situation of "one marshal commanding five chess games" by running factories, running schools, carrying out teaching reforms, conducting scientific research, and implementing militarization.
    Since last year, the victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle has significantly improved the political consciousness of the school's teachers and students. At the same time, the Party has further strengthened its leadership over school education. The school has made necessary reinforcements and supplements to its leadership personnel and grassroots backbone. The Party Branch Secretaries of three out of ten departments concurrently serve as the department heads. Organizationally, the school has established and improved 75 branches, making the Party organization truly the core force driving the school's various tasks. In the past six months, it has been very obvious that all departments, whether implementing the Party's education policy or carrying out teaching and scientific research, have achieved great success under the leadership of the Party, with politics in command.
    Since the school began running factories in July, in just two or three months, it has established 43 factories. The Chemistry and Physics departments, in conjunction with their majors, have found many ways to run factories and have good conditions. The glass factory, hydrochloric acid factory, refractory brick factory, and other factories they have established have already been included in the national plan. Although it is difficult for other liberal arts departments to run factories in conjunction with their majors, they have still established many heavy industries, and the quality of their products meets standards. For example, the asbestos factory run by the Political Education Department has its products sold as far as Lanzhou, and the demand exceeds supply. The iron factory run by the Russian Department can melt ten and a half tons of iron every day and can produce 150 types of products. More than 20 units have already placed orders with them. These factories were all started from scratch and adhere to the principle of running factories diligently and thriftily. In addition, the more than 100 acres of land originally used as so-called experimental land by the Biology Department were divided among the departments for management and operation. The management, operation, and productive labor of these factories and farms have become compulsory courses in the school and are an important part of the students' learning life.
    While running factories on a large scale, the school's students are also running schools outside the campus on a large scale. In one or two months, the departments have established a total of 450 universities, middle schools, primary schools, and literacy classes in factories, communes, government agencies, and military units outside the campus, promoting social cultural revolution and technological revolution. Many large communes, as well as large factories with thousands of people or units with large numbers of people, have solved the problem of teacher shortage due to the students from the Normal University running schools there. At the same time, the students have also boldly reformed the old spare-time education in accordance with the policy of combining education with productive labor, and have compiled teaching materials suitable for factory and rural teaching, improving the learning efficiency of workers and peasants. For example, when teaching geometry to workers, the students of the Mathematics Department broke the old traditions of geometry, abandoned useless and cumbersome proofs, and brought machine parts to the podium, greatly shortening the time for popularizing higher education in factories.
    In the process of productive labor and running factories and schools, the weaknesses of past teaching, such as being divorced from production and theory being divorced from practice, were fully exposed, which led to a thorough reform from teaching ideology and content to teaching methods. For example, although the Biology Department had more than 100 acres of experimental land, in the past, professors taught students grafting with dead branches in the classroom and taught students sowing seeds on sand tables. When they entered the world of nature today and actually grafted plants, they had to learn from the farm workers from scratch. Students in the Education Department studied the history of education in China and abroad, but did not understand the current educational situation and experience in our country at all. These situations fully reflect the face of bourgeois pseudo-science. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, teachers and students in each department launched mass academic criticisms against the past teaching of various subjects, which were divorced from reality, divorced from production, and contained bourgeois ideas, viewpoints, and methods. At the same time, according to the Party's education policy, as well as the principles of linking with production practice, eliminating cumbersome repetition, and adding modern advanced scientific achievements, and combining the experience and understanding of productive labor practice in this period, the teachers and students of each department revised all teaching plans, re-compiled the teaching syllabus of 127 courses, and most of the course textbooks. In addition, each department replaced the past "teaching method" courses and "educational practice" that were divorced from reality with the productive and teaching practice of going to the countryside and factories to run schools.
    The school's mass scientific research activities have achieved unprecedented results. From the end of August to now, the school has completed a total of 1,701 scientific research projects. In terms of quantity, it is equal to four times the total number of scientific research projects completed in the past four years. In terms of quality, all the topics completed are to solve practical problems, and some have reached and exceeded the international level. Among them, more than 90% were completed by students collectively. Second-year students in the Mathematics Department have developed a graph for calculating the stress per meter of factory chimneys, which can shorten the time for calculating the stress of a chimney in current construction engineering from three days to ten minutes. This has universal significance for the technological innovation of factory chimney construction throughout the country.
    A month ago, inspired by the direct aggression of U.S. imperialism against our territory of Taiwan and other places, the teachers and students of the Normal University achieved militarization throughout the school in a few days and established a militia regiment. The departments also used the organizational form of the army to lead factory operation, school operation, and scientific research activities.
    The new situation of "one marshal commanding five chess games" has fundamentally changed the face of the Normal University. This vibrant and thriving garden has become an organization that combines factories, farms, schools, scientific research units, and barracks into one. This organization will become a powerful institution for cultivating working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert.

    在教育与生产劳动相结合的方针下
    北京师范大学成为红色熔炉
    全体师生办工厂办学校进行教学改革开展科学研究实行军事化
    本报讯　北京师范大学贯彻执行党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，政治挂帅，办工厂、办学校、进行教学改革、开展科学研究、实行军事化这样“一个元帅五盘棋”的新局面。
    去年以来，全民整风和反右斗争的胜利，使该校师生政治觉悟显著提高。同时，党进一步加强对学校教育的领导，该校从领导人员以至基层骨干，都作了必要的加强和充实，十个系中，已有三个系的系主任是由系总支书记兼任；组织方面，全校建立和健全了七十五个支部，使党的组织真正成为推进学校各项工作的核心力量。近半年来，可以很明显地看到：各系不论是贯彻党的教育方针或进行教学、科学研究等工作，都做到了在党的领导下，政治挂帅，取得很大的成绩。
    这个学校从7月开始办厂到现在，短短两三个月的时间，兴办了四十三个工厂。化学系、物理系结合专业，办厂门路多，条件好。他们创办的玻璃厂、盐酸厂、耐火砖厂等工厂产品，已经纳入了国家的计划。其他文史各系虽然难结合专业办厂，但他们仍然办起了不少重型工厂，产品质量达到标准。如政教系办的石棉厂，产品已远销兰州，供不应求。俄语系办的铁工厂，每天可以化铁十吨半，可以生产一百五十种规格的产品，现已有二十多个单位向他们订货。这些工厂都是白手起家，并坚持了勤俭办厂的原则。此外，原来作为生物系所谓实验用的一百多亩土地，划分给各系经营操作。这些工厂、农场的经营管理，生产劳动，已成为学校的必修课程，是同学们学习生活中的重要内容。
    在大办工厂的同时，这个学校的学生还在校外大办学校。一两个月中，各系在校外工厂、公社、机关、部队共创办大、中、小学校和扫盲班等四百五十所，推动了社会的文化革命和技术革命。许多大公社以及数千人的大工厂或人数众多的单位，由于师大同学去办学而解决了师资缺乏的问题。同时，同学们还按照教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，对旧的业余教育进行了大胆改革，并编写了适合工厂、农村教学的教材，提高了工农群众学习的效率。如数学系同学向工人教授几何学时，他们打破几何学的旧传统，抛弃了无用和繁琐的证明，把机器零件搬上了讲台，大大缩短了在工厂普及高等教育的时间。
    在生产劳动和办厂、办学过程中，过去教学脱离生产、理论脱离实际的弱点，暴露无遗，从而引起了一个从教学思想内容到教学方法的彻底的改革。如生物系虽拥有百多亩实验园地，可是，过去教授们却是在教室里用死木枝教学生嫁接，在沙盘上教学生撒种。待今天走进大自然的天地，真正嫁接植物时，却不得不向农场工人从头学起。教育系同学学了中外教育史，对我国当前教育情况和经验却根本不了解。这些情况，充分反映了资产阶级伪科学的面貌。在党委领导下，各系师生针对过去各科教学中理论脱离实际、教学脱离生产、资产阶级思想、观点和方法，展开了群众性的学术批判。同时，各系师生根据党的教育工作方针，以及联系生产实际、取消繁琐重复、增添近代先进科学成就等原则，并结合这一时期生产劳动实践的经验、体会，修订了全部教学计划，重新编写了一百二十七门课程的教学大纲和大部分课程的教材。此外，各系还以下乡下厂办学的生产、教学实践，代替了过去脱离实际的“教学法”课程和“教育实习”。
    全校群众性的科学研究活动，取得与过去无法比拟的成绩。从8月下旬到现在，全校共完成科学研究项目一千七百零一项。比数量，等于过去四年完成科学研究项目总和的四倍，比质量，完成的这些题目全部是解决实际问题的，有的达到和超过了国际水平。其中由同学们集体研究完成的占90％以上。数学系二年级的同学研究出一个计算工厂烟囱每公尺应力的图象，可以将目前建筑工程中计算一个烟囱应力的时间，由三天缩短到十几分钟。这对全国工厂烟囱建筑技术革新有着普遍的意义。
    一个月前，师范大学的师生们激于美帝国主义对我国领土台湾等地的直接侵略行为，在几天中，全校实现了军事化，成立了民兵团。各系还以军队的组织形式来领导办厂、办学和开展科学研究活动。
    “一个元帅五盘棋”的新局面，使师大的面貌发生了根本的变化。这块朝气勃勃、欣欣向荣的园地，成为工厂、农场、学校、科学研究单位和兵营合而为一的组织。这个组织将成为培养又红又专的工人阶级知识分子的强有力的机构。
