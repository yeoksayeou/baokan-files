Before Stone Barrier Mountain, Steel Smelters

Our Correspondent Ye Zujian, Huang Changlu

Millions of people on the Yunnan Plateau have joined the iron and steel front. Recently, the average daily output has exceeded 30,000 tons of iron and more than 1,000 tons of steel.

In the smelting of iron and steel, people have overcome unexpected difficulties. Some say this is called everyone smelting steel, and steel smelting everyone.

One evening during Steel Week, we arrived at the Ciba Iron and Steel District in the suburbs of Kunming. In front of Stone Barrier Mountain, the blazing firelight of more than a thousand iron and steel furnaces illuminated half the sky.

We came to a cave and saw two earth converters back to back. One was spattering steel flowers, about to tap steel; the other converter was extinguished and being repaired. This extinguished furnace was managed by the technical personnel of the Design Section of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory. Chen Yingzhang, the Party Branch Secretary of this section, told a joke about amateurs surpassing "experts" at the side of this furnace. On the 13th, various sections of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory began smelting steel using indigenous converters made of waste gasoline barrels and refractory clay. In three days and nights, all the indigenous converters produced steel. Barbers, cooks, tailors, gardeners, and administrative cadres smelted thirty-eight heats of steel. Doctors and nurses smelted eighteen heats. Only the furnace of these designers produced one and a half heats of poor-quality steel and raised the white flag. Faced with this situation, the technical personnel had different opinions and went their own ways. The main reason was that politics was not put in command. Everyone thought they were experts and did not humbly learn from the workers. After finding the reason, the Party Branch of this section invited Lu Sheng, the foreman of the smelting section, to guide them. At this time, the molten iron in the furnace was not boiling and was not spattering sparks. Some people were discouraged and said: This heat is going to "blow" again, let's just pour the molten iron out and start over. Some technical personnel were flustered and didn't know what to do. Master Lu Sheng was very calm. He put his ear close to the converter and listened for a while and said: This is a good heat of steel. As long as the furnace and the steel receiving ladle are heated to the proper temperature, the steel will flow out in a while. It would be a pity to pour it out. After a while, sure enough, steel flowers splattered, and a good heat of steel was smelted. Afterwards, the technical personnel smelted five consecutive heats of good steel according to Master Lu Sheng's method.

We turned to another converter and saw several female nurses carrying a pot of boiling molten iron, passing through the splashing steel flowers, and pouring the molten iron into the converter. This indigenous converter was managed by fifteen doctors and nurses from the Health Section of the Kunming Machine Tool Factory. Originally, many health personnel believed that seeing patients and smelting steel were two completely unrelated things. Doctors can accurately diagnose patients' symptoms, but it is indeed difficult to imagine accurately judging the heat of molten steel. But now these people can not only judge the heat but also smelt steel. Since the 14th, they have smelted more than thirty heats of steel. More importantly than these few heats of steel is that steel has tempered people. The Party Branch Secretary of the Health Section pointed to a young nurse, Yang Yuying, who was intently repairing the converter not far away, and told us a story about her. On the 16th, Yang Yuying had not slept for four days and four nights. That day at ten o'clock in the morning, she operated the converter's steering wheel to smelt a heat of steel and then went to another converter. Suddenly, she blacked out and fainted in front of the furnace door. Comrades hurriedly lifted her up, carried her into the cave behind, and poured a lot of camphor water into her mouth before she woke up. As soon as she saw that she was lying in the cave, she suddenly stood up, struggled to walk to the entrance of the cave, and wanted to go back to smelting steel. Comrades helped her back into the cave and forced her to rest. She said excitedly: "As long as I don't fall down, I still want to work."

We walked through countless steel furnaces. The early winter night was chilling. But between the steel flowers and the flow of molten iron, the working people were soaked in sweat.

Suddenly, it rained lightly. Everyone brought coir raincoats, raincoats, oilcloth, and quilts to cover the furnace body and bellows to protect the furnace.

The east turned white. The firelight from thousands of indigenous steel furnaces soared into the sky. The sound of more than ten thousand people pulling the bellows shook the mountains and fields. You think, how can we not forge real steel warriors here!

    石关山前钢炼人
    本报记者　叶子健　黄昌禄
    云南高原上有几百万人参加了钢铁战线。最近平均每天产铁三万吨以上，钢一千多吨。
    在冶炼钢铁中，人们排除了意想不到的困难。有人说这叫做人人炼钢，钢炼人人。
    在钢铁周的一个傍晚，我们来到了昆明郊区的茨坝钢铁区。在石关山前，一千多座炼铁炼钢炉的熊熊的火光映红了半边天。
    我们来到一个山洞前，看见两个背靠的土转炉，一个钢花四溅，快要出钢了；另一个转炉熄了火正在修理。这熄了火的炉子是昆明机床厂设计科的技术人员们掌管的。这个科的党支部书记陈应章在这个炉边讲了一段外行胜过“内行”的笑话，13日，昆明机床厂的各个科室一齐开始用废汽油桶和耐火泥做的土转炉炼钢。三昼夜间，所有的土转炉都出了钢，理发师、炊事员、裁缝、花匠和行政干部炼了三十八炉钢，医生和护士炼出了十八炉，只有这个设计师们的炉子，出了一炉半质量不好的钢，插了白旗。面对这种情况，技术人员们众说纷纭，各行其是。主要原因是政治没有挂帅。大家都认为自己是内行，不虚心向工人学习。原因找出来后，这个科的党支部请熔炼工段的工段长陆升老师傅来指导。这时这个炉子里的铁水老不沸腾，也不冒火花。有的人泄气地说：这一炉又“吹”了，干脆把铁水倒了另来。有的技术人员手忙脚乱，不知如何是好。陆升师傅很冷静，他把耳朵凑近转炉听了一会说：这是一炉好钢，只要把炉子和盛钢桶烧到应有的温度，过一会钢就能流出来。倒了太可惜了。过了一会，果然钢花四溅，炼出一炉好钢来。以后技术人员按照陆升的办法一连炼出来五炉好钢。
    我们转身来到另一个转炉面前，看见几个女护士抬着一锅滚烫的铁水，穿过飞溅的钢花，把铁水注进了转炉里。这座土转炉是昆明机床厂卫生科的十五个医生和护士掌管的。原来有不少卫生人员认为看病和炼钢，简直是风马牛不相及的两回事。医生摸病人的症候，可以十拿九稳；可是要准确地看钢水的火候，的确难以设想。但是现在这些人不仅能看火候，还能炼出钢来。从14日开始，他们已经炼了三十多炉钢了，更重要的不是这几炉钢，而是钢铁锻炼了人。卫生科党支部书记指着不远处一个正在紧张聚精会神地修补转炉的青年护士杨育英对我们讲了一段她的事情。16日，杨育英有四天四夜没有睡觉了。这一天上午十点多钟，他掌着转炉的方向盘炼完了一炉钢，又到另一个转炉上去。忽然眼前一黑就昏倒在炉门前。同志们慌忙把她抬起来送进了后面的山洞里，往她嘴里灌了许多樟脑水，她才苏醒过来。她一见躺在洞里，就猛一下站起来挣扎着走到了洞口，想再去炼钢。同志们把她搀回洞里强迫她休息。她激动地说：“只要不倒下来，就还要干。”
    我们在无数的钢铁炉间穿行。初冬的夜晚，寒意料峭。而在钢花铁流之间，劳动的人们却汗湿了衣衫。
    忽然，下了一阵细雨，大家把蓑衣、雨衣、油布和被子拿来盖住炉身和风箱，保护炉子。
    东方发白了。千百座钢铁土炉的火光冲天。一万多人拉动风箱的声音震动着山野。你想，在这里，怎能不锻炼得出真正的钢铁战士呢！
