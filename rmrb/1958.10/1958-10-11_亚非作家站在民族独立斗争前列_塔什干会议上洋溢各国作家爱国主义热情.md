Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, October 9th: The Asian and African Writers' Conference continued its plenary sessions on the mornings of the 9th and afternoons of the 8th, discussing the first item on the agenda. In their speeches, the representatives talked about the friendship and cultural exchange between the peoples of Asia and Africa, and about the role of Asian and African literature in the anti-colonialist struggle.

    Cypriot writer Tofik Roussos spoke about the issue of patriotism in literature, saying that the national liberation struggle has inspired the work of our poets, who have created many works full of patriotism. The great responsibility of our writers at present is: to do everything possible to fight against foreign rule and to crush the shackles of colonialism.

    Jordanian poet Abu-Khalima said in his speech that the imperialists have carried out cruel oppression against our country's writers and thinkers. Some of them have been imprisoned, some have been persecuted, and some have been forced to flee abroad. However, Jordanian writers have never stopped fighting. Whether in prison or in exile, they sing songs of battle. They sing of the victory of the Arab people and the birth of the Republic of Iraq.

    Pakistani writer Jalandari said at the meeting that our meeting is filled with a spirit of cooperation and mutual understanding. He also pointed out that literary figures should not forget politics, because a pen and a pencil, if held in the hands of someone who believes in the justice of their cause, will be more powerful than any evil force or any weapon.

    Nigerian writer Abdul Hafiz Abu said that if all educated people gathered together as we are now, peace would be maintained and progress would be guaranteed.

    Sudanese representative Muhiddin Sabir sharply criticized the practice of those who are hostile to progress and attempt to spread national chauvinism in certain African countries in order to divide the people.

    Japanese writer Hiroshi Noma said at the meeting that Japan was the first country to be harmed by the atomic bomb, but when the people's wounds are still fresh, the United States is planning new wars, which cannot but arouse indignation in the Japanese literary world.

    United Arab Republic female writer Bikht-Ash-Shat said in her speech that the history of the growth of literature in Arab countries is inseparable from the history of the national liberation movement in the East. The writer's work is a weapon for the Arab people to struggle against the imperialists' attempts to isolate Arab countries.

    Indian writer Bannerjee said in his speech that we Asian and African writers are the heirs of the great traditions of Asia and Africa, and we express the ideals and aspirations of the Eastern people. He said that writers have an important responsibility in realizing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    Nepalese writer Divcote talked about the need to bring literature closer to the people and deepen it into the masses.

    The famous Turkish poet Hikmet also spoke.

    Representatives from Uganda, Somaliland, and Angola also spoke at the meeting this morning.

    The famous American black writer Du Bois came here today and was warmly welcomed. Today, the representatives also warmly welcomed the writers from Pakistan, Senegal, and Nepal who had just arrived.

    The government of the Soviet Uzbek Republic held a reception on the evening of the 8th to entertain the representatives and guests attending the Asian and African Writers' Conference.

    In addition to the Asian and African writers' representatives, famous Western writers, Uzbek literary figures, artists, and social activists attended the reception.

    On the evening of the 9th, the poets participating in the Asian and African Writers' Conference held a poetry evening at the Mukimi Theater in Tashkent. The famous Chinese female writer Xie Bingxin recited a poem she wrote during the conference.

    The evening was hosted by Zulfiya, a famous Uzbek female poet, who expressed her heartfelt welcome to the guests. Poets from Asian and African countries recited their works in Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, Vietnamese, Burmese, Ghanaian, Cambodian, Soviet Central Asian, and Transcaucasian languages in this crowded hall. Their recitations were warmly welcomed.

    The Drama Week held for the Asian and African Writers' Conference continued on the 9th in six theaters and conservatories in Tashkent. The Gorky Theater staged "Thunderstorm" by the Chinese playwright Cao Yu. The program of this Drama Week included forty-five excellent scripts from Asian and African countries.

    据新华社塔什干9日电　9日上午和8日下午，亚非作家会议继续举行全体会议，讨论第一项议程。代表们在发言中谈到亚非各国人民的友谊和文化交流，谈到亚非各国文学在反殖民主义斗争中的作用。
    塞浦路斯作家托夫克鲁斯谈到文学中的爱国主义问题时说，民族解放斗争鼓舞了我们诗人的工作，他们创作了许多充满爱国主义的作品。我们作家当前的伟大责任是：尽一切力量为反对异族统治，为粉碎殖民主义枷锁而努力。
    约旦诗人阿布—卡利马在发言中说，帝国主义者对我们国家的作家和思想家进行残酷的压迫，他们之中有些人被关进牢狱，有些人受到迫害，有些人被迫逃亡到国外。但是，约旦作家一直没停止战斗，无论在监牢里或逃亡外地，他们都唱着战斗的歌曲。他们歌唱阿拉伯人民的胜利，歌唱伊拉克共和国的诞生。
    巴基斯坦作家贾兰达里在会上说，我们的会见充满了合作和相互谅解的精神。他还指出，文学家不应当忘记政治，因为钢笔和铅笔如果操在相信自己事业正义性的人的手中，就会比任何邪恶势力、比任何武器都更有力量。

    阿联女作家比克特—阿什—沙特在发言中指出，阿拉伯国家文学成长的历史是和东方民族解放运动的历史分不开的。作家的作品是阿拉伯人民进行斗争、反对帝国主义企图孤立阿拉伯国家的武器。
