    Two Poems
    Lin Boqu
    People's Commune
    The wisdom of 600 million people is abundant, how are the fruits of spring blossom and autumn harvest coming along?
    One blast from the furnace opens a new era, grains of rice weighing a thousand catties transform old songs.
    Xu Shui's advancement triggers widespread emulation, the fleeting shadow of Paris is but a precursor.
    We must strive to complete the entire task, may the world be peaceful and the seas tranquil.

    Taiwan has always been a part of China
    They want to travel a road that leads nowhere, laughing at the yelping dogs trying to bark at Yao.
    Who has seen mirages rising in the air, one should know there are rainbows over the river.
    Playing with fire will eventually burn one's own hands, begging for mercy only makes the tail wag more frequently.
    The hatred of eight million people in Taiwan and Penghu, such accumulated fuel is already burning.

    诗二首
    林伯渠
    人民公社
    六亿人民智慧多，春华秋实近如何？
    洪炉一鼓开新局，粒米千钧变旧歌。
    徐水挺进纷后起，巴黎昙影只先河。
    尚须努力毕全役，举世太平海不波。
    台湾自古就是中国的
    道路欲行没一条，笑看桀犬想吠尧。
    谁见空中起海市，应知江上有虹桥。
    玩火终将手自灼，乞怜徒使尾频摇。
    台澎八百万人恨，如此积薪已燃烧。
