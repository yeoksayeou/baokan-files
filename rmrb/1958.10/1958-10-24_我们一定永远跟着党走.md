    We Must Always Follow the Party
    Jin Zichang, Technician, Gucheng Tanshan Coal Mine
    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is about to be established. This is a great happy event for us Hui people. It is the Communist Party that has given us the right to national regional autonomy. We will never forget the Party's kindness.
    I am a coal miner. I worked as a farmhand for others, herding sheep and driving camels for more than ten years since I was fourteen. After liberation, I stood up. In 1955, the government sent me to work at the Tanshan Coal Mine. In the mine, the leaders personally taught me coal mining techniques and took care of me in every possible way in life. I felt that the mine was better than my own home. Therefore, I made up my mind to produce well and never let down the Party's expectations of me. Together with my fellow workers, I overcame many difficulties and overfulfilled the coal production task by two thousand tons last year, and was rated as a provincial advanced producer. Recently, I was elected as a people's representative of the autonomous region. What a noble honor! I deeply realize that the Communist Party is the great savior of our minority nationalities, and we must listen to the Party and always follow the Party!

    我们一定永远跟着党走
    固原炭山煤矿技工　金自昌
    宁夏回族自治区快要成立了，这是我们回族人民的大喜事，是共产党给了我们民族区域自治的权利，我们永远也忘不了党的恩惠。
    我是个煤矿工人。我从十四岁就给人家做长工，放羊，赶骆驼十多年。解放后，我翻了身。1955年，政府送我到炭山煤矿去做工。在矿上，领导上亲自教给我挖煤技术，在生活上照顾得更是无微不至，我感到矿上比自己的家里还好。因此我下定决心好好生产，决不能辜负党对我的希望。我和工友同志们一块，克服了重重困难，去年超额两千吨完成了产煤任务，被评为省级先进生产者。最近，我又被选为自治区人民代表，这是多么崇高的荣誉呀！我深深地体会到：共产党是我们少数民族人民的大救星，我们一定要听党的话，永远跟着党走！
