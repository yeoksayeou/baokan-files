Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Taipei dispatch: Recently, Taiwan newspapers have been rife with discussions about the results of the Dulles-Chiang talks. Many newspapers have expressed outrage at Dulles' oppressive behavior in coming to Taiwan and have voiced concerns that the U.S. may one day sacrifice the Taiwan authorities, urging the Taiwan authorities to carefully consider their future. Taiwan's "Min Tsu Evening News" even pointed out that the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué is the product of the U.S. beginning to implement a "tightrope policy" towards the Taiwan authorities. This "tightrope" deserves the Taiwan authorities' vigilance.

Taipei's "United Daily News" editorial on the 26th stated that Dulles rushed to Taipei due to pressure from public opinion, seeking a "commitment from the Taiwan authorities not to rely on force," "and then using this commitment to account to the domestic people and the international appeasers." The newspaper said that the Taiwan authorities "recognize the trend of the current general situation and look forward to the long years ahead. There are too many deep questions that need to be considered and carefully decided upon today."

On the eve of the publication of the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué, the "United Daily News" editorial admitted that "there is indeed a question of whether or not there can be mutual trust" between the U.S. authorities and the Taiwan authorities, and that "whether or not close cooperation can be achieved in an emergency situation still needs to be tested by facts."

The newspaper pointed out that the U.S. is constantly "wary" of the Chiang Kai-shek group. "This is the distrust of us by the American people. On our side, there is often a concern that in the event of an emergency, the U.S. will abandon us or even force us to give up some sovereignty in exchange for temporary peace and security." The newspaper said that many differences of opinion are caused by a "subtle psychological wariness." "If this mutual suspicion continues to develop, it may undermine the basis of cooperation between the two sides."

While expressing concerns about the U.S., the newspaper pleaded with the U.S. on behalf of the Taiwan authorities, saying that the Taiwan authorities "are cautious and prudent in everything, not only taking into account the promises made to the U.S., but also actively coordinating with the U.S. at every step." It said, "We are sacrificing and enduring so much, and our international friends should not doubt us any further."

Previously, the "United Daily News" had urged the Taiwan authorities to beware of being sacrificed by others. It said, "Appeasers want to be generous with others' possessions in exchange for their own temporary security. They really want to give away Jinmen and Matsu, but they can't achieve their goal all at once, so they have to do it in several steps." The newspaper also demanded that the Taiwan authorities be wary of "political isolation" and find ways to "break the deadlock" when "international appeasers want to sell us out," and not "accept the 'two Chinas' arrangement."

Taiwan's "Min Tsu Evening News" commented on the 26th that Dulles' trip to Taipei was to implement the U.S.'s "tightrope policy" towards the Taiwan authorities. During the Dulles-Chiang talks, "the atmosphere here in Taipei was unusually gloomy in the past few days." "During the three-day meeting, there were constant reports that differences could not be coordinated. Frankly speaking, Dulles' statement when he got off the plane, 'The purpose of our consultations is not to reach any new agreements,' gave many people a feeling of being doused with cold water."

The commentary said that in the Dulles-Chiang talks, "what Dulles wanted to talk about was precisely what we (referring to the Taiwan authorities) were most unwilling to promise; and what we wanted to talk about was precisely what Dulles was difficult to promise. There were differences in the choice of topics between the two sides, and even though they both had a deep mutual understanding of their basic positions, differences were inevitable." The commentary said that the result of Dulles' visit to Taiwan to implement the "tightrope policy" was the publication of the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué, and reading this communiqué "makes our mood heavy."

Taiwan's "Cheng Hsin News" said on the 26th that the "worries and doubts" generally caused by the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué in Taiwan "have not yet been completely clarified." The Taiwan Legislative Yuan invited Huang Shao-ku and Yeh Kung-chao to "attend a closed-door meeting to report, which was to understand the inside story." The newspaper wrote again on the 24th, "Dulles' special visit to Taiwan has been exaggerated by foreign news agencies as exerting pressure on our government (referring to the Taiwan authorities)." Therefore, "it is inevitable that the two sides will have differences on a certain issue during the talks." Prior to this, the newspaper had advised the Taiwan authorities to "act according to their own best judgment," saying, "This is our security deployment on the territory over which we have sovereignty."

Taiwan's "Independence Evening Post" said on the 26th that the outside world is still confused about the rumors of a rift between Dulles and Chiang during the talks, and many people believe that there were indeed unpleasant things during the talks. The newspaper vaguely said that after the first meeting between Dulles and Chiang on the 21st, the newspapers in Taipei attached great importance to the news photos of Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles together, but the photos taken by various parties the next day were not published in the newspapers. The reason was that they were "ordered" to be temporarily withheld, and then the rumor of a rift between the two sides spread. When the newspaper commented on the Dulles-Chiang joint communiqué on the 24th, it sadly said, "Although emotionally, we find it difficult to accept this recognition by the government of a friendly country (referring to U.S. imperialism), we cannot but painfully accept it in reason and objective circumstances. Therefore, we believe that after this high-level meeting between China (Chiang) and the United States, we are facing a long-term and arduous struggle more clearly than before. Whether we like it or not, we cannot but face reality and completely indulge in fantasy."

The "Independence Evening Post" published an editorial on the 21st, the day Dulles arrived in Taipei, saying, "Whoever wants to sell us out and make plans that violate our wishes will forever be despised and abandoned by the Chinese people." Before that, the newspaper also advised the Taiwan authorities to "resolutely oppose any measures that undermine sovereignty and swear not to accept them even if it means death."

### 寄人篱下多屈辱　钢索临头实可哀  台湾报纸不满美国欺压深为台湾当局寒心

    寄人篱下多屈辱　钢索临头实可哀
    台湾报纸不满美国欺压深为台湾当局寒心
    新华社29日讯　台北消息：最近台湾报纸对杜蒋会谈的结果议论纷纭。许多报纸都对杜勒斯跑到台湾进行欺压的行为表示愤慨，并且对美国有朝一日会牺牲台湾当局的做法感到担忧，促醒台湾当局慎重考虑前途。台湾“民族晚报”更指出杜蒋会谈公报是美国开始对台湾当局施行“钢索政策”的产物。这个“钢索”值得台湾当局提防。
    台北“联合报”26日的社论说，杜勒斯赶到台北来，是迫于舆论的反对，为了觅取台湾当局“非凭借武力的承诺”，“然后再以此承诺，向国内人民交代，向国际姑息分子交代”。这家报纸说，台湾当局“认识了当前大形势的归趋，展望今后的悠长岁月，实在有太多太深的问题，需要我们在今天即行开始考虑，慎密决断”。
    在杜蒋会谈公报发表前夕，“联合报”的社论承认，美国当局和台湾当局之间“确实存在着一个是否能够互相信任的问题”，而双方“在紧急状态下是否能够密切合作，还需要事实来加以考验”。
    这家报纸指出，美国时时对蒋介石集团“提防”，“这是美国人士对我们的不信任心理。而在我们这方面，则常常有一种疑虑，深怕逢到紧急事故，美国会背弃我们，甚至会逼迫我们放弃一些主权来换一时的和平苟安。”报纸说，有许多意见的参差，都是由一种“微妙的心理戒备”引起的，“如果这种相互间的疑惧再发展下去，就很可能损害双方合作的基础”。
    这家报纸在对美国表示疑虑之余，却替台湾当局向美国乞怜，它说，台湾当局“事事审慎持重，不仅顾到对美国所提供的诺言，并且还主动的处处与美国的步骤取得协调”。它说，“我们如此牺牲，如此忍耐，国际友人应不致再怀疑我们。”
    在这以前，“联合报”曾经促请台湾当局提防被别人牺牲。它说，
  “姑息主义者就是要慷他人之慨，以换取自身的暂时苟安。他们确确实实想要把金、马送掉，只是无法一下子达成目的，要把它分成几步来做”。这家报纸还要求台湾当局在“国际姑息分子要出卖我们”的时候，要提防“政治上被孤立”，要设法“突破僵局”，不要“接受‘两个中国’的安排”。
    台湾“民族晚报”26日的评论说，杜勒斯这次到台北，是为了执行美国对台湾当局施行的“钢索政策”。在杜蒋会谈期间的“台北的过去几天中，此间的空气竟异常的沉郁”，“在三天的会议中，不断传出歧见未能协调的报道。平心而论，杜卿（指杜勒斯）下飞机时那一句‘吾人之会商并非以获致任何新的协议为目的’的声明，即让许多人感到当头浇了冷水的感觉。”
    评论说，在杜蒋会谈中，“杜卿所要谈的，正是我们（指台湾当局）所最不愿承诺的；而我们所要谈的，正是杜卿所难于承诺的。双方在主题选择上有了出入，尽管彼此对基本立场均有深切的相互了解，自亦难免发生歧见。”评论说，杜勒斯到台湾执行“钢索政策”的结果，是发表了杜蒋会谈公报，读了这个公报“我们的心情是沉重的”。
    台湾“征信新闻”26日说，杜蒋会谈公报在台湾普遍引起的“忧疑”，至今“仍未能完全澄清”。台湾立法院邀请黄少谷和叶公超“列席秘密会议报告，即为谋了解此中内情之故”。这家报纸在24日又写道，“杜勒斯的专程访台已被外电渲染为对我政府（指台湾当局）施予压力”，因此，“会谈进行中，双方对某一问题产生歧见，乃必然现象”。在这以前，这家报纸曾经劝台湾当局“依据自己认为最佳的判断而行事”，它说：“这是我们在拥有主权的领土上的安全部署”。
    台湾“自立晚报”26日说，关于杜蒋双方在会谈中发生裂痕的传说，至今外界仍感迷惑，并且许多人都认为会谈中确实有不愉快的事。这家报纸隐约地说，在21日杜蒋首次会谈后，台北市各报对蒋介石与杜勒斯合照的新闻图片，都相当重视，但是，第二天各方所拍的照片都不见在报上刊登。原因是“奉命”暂不发表，于是传出了双方发生裂痕之说。这家报纸在24日评杜蒋会谈公报的时候伤心地说，“尽管在情感上，对于友邦政府（指美帝）的这一认定，我们颇难接受，但在理智和客观的形势下我们又不能不痛苦地加以接受。为此，我们认为，经过此次中（蒋）美高层会议以后，我们已较前更为明确地面对一长期艰苦的斗争。无论我们是否乐意，我们总不能不面对现实，而完全酖于一种空想。”
    “自立晚报”在21日杜勒斯抵台北的一天发表社论说，“谁要是想出卖我们，作违反我们愿望的打算，谁就将永为中国人所不齿，所抛弃。”在这以前，这家报纸还劝告台湾当局“对任何有损于主权的措施，坚决反对到底，誓死亦不接受”。
