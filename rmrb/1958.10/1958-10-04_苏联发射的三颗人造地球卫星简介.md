Today, a year ago, the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial satellite. The successful launch of this satellite inaugurated a new era in human science. The first artificial satellite was a spherical body with a diameter of 58 centimeters and a weight of 83.6 kilograms. It was equipped with two radio transmitters. The time it took to orbit the Earth was initially one hour and thirty-five minutes, and later slightly less than ninety minutes. The orbit's maximum distance from the ground reached 947 kilometers. This satellite orbited the Earth 1,400 times, flying a distance equal to the distance from Earth to Mars at Mars' closest approach to Earth—60 million kilometers. It completed its mission on January 4, 1958, and fell into the dense atmosphere and disintegrated.

Following the successful launch of the first satellite, Soviet scientists launched the second artificial satellite on November 3 of the same year. This satellite constituted the last stage of the carrier rocket and contained instruments for studying solar radiation in the short-wave ultraviolet and X-ray spectrum, instruments for studying cosmic rays, instruments for studying temperature and pressure, and the experimental animal—the dog Laika. This satellite weighed a total of 508.3 kilograms, had an orbital speed of 8,000 meters per second, and a maximum distance of more than 1,500 kilometers from the Earth's surface. It orbited the Earth in one hour and forty-two minutes. The second satellite orbited the Earth approximately 2,370 times, traveling more than 100 million kilometers, and disintegrated on April 14 this year. It obtained new and valuable data on the density of the upper atmosphere and solved some other problems in geophysics for the first time.

The third artificial satellite was launched on May 15 this year. This satellite weighs 1,327 kilograms, fifteen times heavier than the first and 1.6 times heavier than the second. Its shape is conical, with a base diameter of 1 meter 73 centimeters and a height of 3 meters 57 centimeters. The instruments installed on this satellite can conduct research on the pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, the concentration of positive ions, the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, the intensity of solar corpuscular radiation, and the composition and changes of primary cosmic rays, etc., throughout its orbit. According to Soviet scientists, this artificial satellite can exist for one year. Now, it is still orbiting the Earth at a speed of one revolution every 106 minutes.

The successful launch of the three Soviet artificial satellites powerfully demonstrates that mankind has taken another step forward on the long journey of conquering the universe. And it vividly illustrates that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind.

    苏联发射的三颗人造地球卫星简介
    一年前的今天，苏联成功地发射了第一个人造卫星。这个卫星的发射成功，开创了人类科学的新纪元。第一个人造卫星是一个球形体，直径五十八公分，重八十三点六公斤。内装两部无线电发报机。它绕行地球一周的时间，开始时是一小时三十五分钟，后来则稍小于九十分钟。轨道距离地面最大高度达九百四十七公里。这个卫星围绕地球运行了一千四百圈，飞过了等于在火星离地球最近的时候从地球到火星的距离——六千万公里的路程。它于1958年1月4日完成了自己的使命，落到稠密的大气层中陨灭了。
    继第一个卫星发射成功之后，苏联科学家又于同年11月3日发射了第二个人造卫星。这个卫星构成运载火箭的最后一级，内部载有研究太阳在短波紫外线和X射线光谱段的辐射的仪器，研究宇宙线的仪器，研究温度和压力的仪器以及试验动物——小狗莱伊卡。这个卫星总重量五百零八点三公斤，轨道速度每秒八千公尺，离地球表面的最大距离超过一千五百公里。它围绕地球运行一周的时间为一小时四十二分。第二个卫星在围绕地球运行了二千三百七十周左右，走了一亿多公里，于今年4月14日陨灭。它获得了关于大气高层密度的新的宝贵资料，并且第一次解决了地球物理学的某些其他问题。
    第三个人造卫星是今年5月15日发射的。这个卫星重量一千三百二十七公斤，比第一个重十五倍，比第二个重一点六倍。它的形体呈圆锥形，底的直径为一公尺七十三公分，高三公尺五十七公分。这个卫星上装置的仪器，可以在整个轨道上进行高层大气的压力和组成，正离子的浓度，地球磁场强度，太阳微粒辐射强度，原始宇宙线的组成和变化等等的研究。据苏联科学家声称，这个人造卫星可以存在一年。现在，它仍然以每一百零六分钟绕地球一周的速度环绕着地球运行。
    苏联三颗人造卫星发射的成功，有力地表明，人类在征服宇宙的长途中又前进了一步。并且生动地说明：东风已经压倒西风，东风继续压倒西风。
