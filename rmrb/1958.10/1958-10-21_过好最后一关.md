Title: Successfully Passing the Final Hurdle

Agriculture, like other forms of production, must overcome several hurdles to guarantee a bumper harvest. Generally speaking, the three major stages of cultivation, field management, and harvesting must be successfully navigated. Harvesting is the final hurdle, and once this is overcome, there should be no problems. However, it now seems that harvesting is not the final hurdle. The final hurdle is: storage and preservation.

Overcoming the storage and preservation hurdle is not difficult in itself. The difficulty lies in the fact that many people are unwilling to overcome this hurdle, exhibiting hesitation, or even outright surrendering before it. Many cadres in Dayi County, Sichuan Province, believe that "since there is plenty of grain anyway, it doesn't matter if a little is damaged," and that "deep plowing is important, don't waste time drying the grain (one of the storage methods), if the grain goes bad, we can use it to brew liquor." People who hold these views are determined to refuse to pass this hurdle. Is the statement "it doesn't matter if a little is damaged" correct? Of course not. From the perspective of each individual farmer or production team, losing eight or ten catties of grain may not seem significant, but from the national perspective, it is not insignificant, but very significant. If each of the approximately one hundred million farming households in the country loses eight or ten catties, the total loss would be eight hundred million to one billion catties. Is this number small? In reality, the loss per household is even more than eight or ten catties. In the Fourth Team of Anren People's Commune in Dayi County, Sichuan Province, out of the 40,000 catties of grain stored, 30,000 catties were already showing signs of mold and rot. How much sweat and effort did it take to obtain these 30,000 catties of grain? How much effort went into it? What great role would this grain play if used in socialist construction? Therefore, even "a little" cannot be damaged. "Deep plowing is important, don't waste time drying the grain" – this statement seems to hold some water. Aren't we currently asking everyone to make steel and iron while also engaging in autumn harvesting and planting? Isn't deep plowing considered the "constitution" of agricultural production? But what is the purpose of deep plowing? It is ultimately for grain. Deep plowing and preservation are not contradictory; preservation is for protecting the fruits of deep plowing.

Of course, there is a conflict in the use of labor, but it can be completely resolved by discussing it with the masses. Not only are steel and iron production and autumn harvesting and planting the demands of the masses, but so is properly preserving grain. Many cadres in Dayi County originally thought that this problem would be difficult to solve, but after discussing it with the masses, they mobilized 30,000 people for a major clean-up, drying, and spreading operation.

It can be seen that passing the grain storage and preservation hurdle, like passing other hurdles, requires first passing the ideological hurdle. Once the ideological hurdle is passed, the material hurdle will be easier to pass. If the ideological hurdle is not passed, even with warehouses and furniture, the grain will still be placed in damp places, will still be eaten by insects, and even after mold and rot are discovered, no one will care. "Since there is plenty of grain anyway, it doesn't matter if a little is damaged." From this perspective, it is already urgent to launch a major debate on this issue among cadres and farmers!

    过好最后一关
    田连阡
    农业和其他生产一样，要保证丰产丰收，也要过好几道关。按照一般说法，耕种、田间管理和收获这三道大关必须过好。收获是最后一关，过好这一关就没有问题了。现在看来，收获还不是最后一关。最后一关是：收藏保管。
    要过好收藏保管关，并不困难。困难的是有不少人不愿过这道关，在这道关前表现了踌躇不前，甚至干脆表示屈服。四川大邑县有许多干部认为“反正粮食多得很，损坏一点没关系”，“深耕重要，不准洒粮（保管方法之一），粮食坏了，拿来烤酒就是”。有这种论调的人，都是决心拒绝过关的。“损坏一点没关系”，这种说法对不对呢？当然不对，从每个农户或每个生产队来说，损坏八斤十斤粮食，可能关系不大，就全国来说，不是关系不大而是很大。全国约有一亿农户，如果每个农户都损失八斤十斤，就要损失八亿斤到十亿斤，这个数字还小吗？实际上每户损失的还不止八斤十斤。四川大邑县安仁人民公社四中队保管的四万斤粮食中，就有三万斤已经发生霉烂现象。为了得到这三万斤粮食，曾经有多少人流了汗水，曾经有多少人花了心血。这些粮食用到社会主义建设事业上去，将发生多大作用。由此可见，连“一点”也不能损坏。“深耕重要，不准晒粮”，好像这种说法还站得住脚，现在不是要求一边炼钢炼铁一边秋收秋种吗？不是把深耕当成了农业生产的“宪法”吗？但是深耕为了什么？还不是为了粮食。深耕同保管是不矛盾的，保管是为了保护深耕得来的果实。
    当然，在使用劳动力上是有矛盾的，但是只要拿到群众中去讨论，完全可以解决。不仅炼钢炼铁和秋收秋种是群众的要求，保管好粮食也是群众的要求。大邑县许多干部本来认为这个问题不好解决，但是经过群众讨论，就动员起了三万人，来了一次大清仓、大翻晒、大摊凉。
    可见过粮食收藏保管关同过其他关一样，首先要在思想上过关，在思想上过了关，物质关也就容易过了。如果思想上没有过关，即使有了仓库，有了家具，粮食还是会被放到潮湿的地方，还是会被虫蛀食，发现霉烂之后，还是无人过问。“反正粮食多得很，损坏一点没关系。”从这来看，就这个问题在干部和农民中间展开一场大辩论，已是迫不及待的事情了！
