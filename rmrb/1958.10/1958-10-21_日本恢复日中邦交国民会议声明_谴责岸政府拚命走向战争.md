Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations issued a statement after its Standing Committee meeting on the 18th, saying that Nobusuke Kishi's remarks to American reporters showed that the Kishi government is desperately moving down the path of war.

The statement criticized the Kishi government for not only consistently ignoring the Japanese people's demands for breaking the deadlock in Japan-China relations, but also for using its talk of taking the road to war as a response to the people, which is a new provocation against the Japanese people.

The statement pointed out that the current state of tension between Japan and China is precisely due to the Kishi government's war policy. The statement said that the National Council will publicize this matter to the Japanese people and launch a broad national movement to thoroughly investigate the Kishi government's responsibility.

On the same day, the National Council also issued a statement condemning the incident in which right-wing fascist elements burned the Chinese flag in the square in front of Shinbashi train station in Tokyo, strongly protesting the Kishi government's condoning of thugs who insulted the Chinese flag and its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people by not punishing the thugs. The statement also strongly demanded that the Kishi government stop participating in conspiracies to create "two Chinas" and demanded that it take measures to promote friendly relations with China and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries.

    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议18日举行常任理事会会议以后发表一项声明说，岸信介对美国记者发表的谈话表明岸信介政府正在拼命走向战争的道路。
    声明指责岸信介政府不仅一贯忽视日本人民对于打开日中僵局的要求，而且这次竟然还以它要走战争道路的谈话来作为对人民的答复，这是对日本人民的新的挑衅。
