Qinghai Province, a geological blank area, has been increasingly confirmed through six years of geological exploration as a region with extremely rich underground treasures in our country. Geological and petroleum exploration workers and the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups have found more than 2,000 mineral deposits and more than 70 kinds of minerals here. If the reserves of the 15 kinds of minerals that have been proven and initially grasped are used for factory design, it can build three iron and steel industrial bases, four coal industrial bases, two non-ferrous metal joint enterprise bases, and a chemical petroleum industrial base.

The Kunlun Mountains, traversing the middle of Qinghai, have been confirmed as both an "iron belt" and a "coal belt." The Qilian Mountains, known as the "Urals of China," are rich in ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals. The abundance of crystal and iron ore reserves in the Tanggula Mountains is also rare. As for coal, the "food" of industry, four coal belts with proven reserves of more than 5 billion tons have been explored in Qinghai. Dozens of deposits of chromium, manganese, refractory materials, and other minerals used in the steelmaking industry have also been discovered. The complete design data for the Xitieshan lead-zinc mine, which is famous throughout the country for its high grade and large reserves, will be submitted by the end of the year, and relevant departments have already started factory design work. In the more than 100 large and small lakes in western Qinghai, in addition to salt that can feed the world's 2.7 billion people for more than 10,000 years, there are also nitrate salts for fertilizer production and borax for industrial and medicinal use. In the Qaidam Basin, more than 110 oil-bearing structures have been discovered. Almost all exploration wells that have been drilled have yielded crude oil or oil and gas shows, and some have produced large amounts of natural gas. It has now been proven that nine structures definitely have industrial value as oil fields.

The underground harvest in Qinghai Province is the result of the hard work of industrial vanguards. On the summit of the Tanggula Mountains, more than 5,000 meters above sea level, groups one and two of the geological team exploring crystal mines overcame various difficulties and created a new record of 7.9 meters for the efficiency of the manual tunneling team. The borax team, which persisted in a salt lake covering forty square kilometers, created a record of 2,196 meters per month for each machine under extremely difficult living and working conditions, thanks to the unity of the entire team. The local people of all ethnic groups gave great support to the exploration work. In the Qaidam Basin, an old Uyghur man named Aji actively guided the exploration team from the time they entered the basin. He did this for five years as if it were one day, and many mineral deposits were found under his guidance. (Attached picture)

    昆仑山是铁腰带　柴达木是聚宝盆
    青海地下矿藏惊人丰富
    本报讯　在地质空白区的青海省，经过六年来的地质勘探工作，已越来越证实是我国地下宝藏十分丰富的地区。地质石油勘探工作者们和广大各族人民，在这里已找到两千多处矿床，七十多种矿产。如果把已经探明和初步掌握的十五种矿种的储量来进行建厂设计，它可以建三个钢铁工业基地、四个煤炭工业基地、两个有色金属联合企业基地及化学石油工业基地。
    横穿青海中部的昆仑山，证实既是一个“铁腰带”，又是一个“煤腰带”。被誉为“中国的乌拉尔”的祁连山，蕴藏着丰富的黑色金属、有色金属，唐古拉的水晶、铁矿储量之多，也很少见。作为工业食粮的煤，在青海已勘探出储量五十亿吨以上的四条煤带。炼钢工业所用的铬、锰、耐火材料等矿藏也发现了几十处。全国有名的品位高储量大的锡铁山铅锌矿的全部设计资料，年底即可提出，有关部门并已开始建厂设计工作。青海西部的一百多个大小湖泊，除有可供全世界二十七亿人口吃一万多年的食盐外，还有供制化肥的硝盐和工业，医药用的硼砂。在柴达木盆地里，已发现一百一十多个石油储油构造。凡已钻探过的探井，差不多都喷出了原油或有油气显示，有的喷出大量的天然气。现在已经证明有九个构造肯定是具有工业价值的油田。
    青海省的地下丰收是工业尖兵们辛勤劳动的结果。海拔五千多公尺的唐古拉山巅上，勘探水晶矿的地质队一、二组战胜了种种困难，创造了手工掘进班效率七点九公尺的新纪录。坚持在一个四十平方公里的盐湖水中的硼砂队，在生活和工作十分艰苦的情况下，全队团结一致，创造了每台月进尺二千一百九十六公尺的最高纪录。当地各族人民对勘探工作给予了极大的支援。在柴达木盆地，一位维吾尔族的阿吉老汉，从地质勘探队进入盆地起，他就积极地为勘探队作向导，五年如一日，有很多矿点是在他带领下找到的。（附图片）
