Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 3rd. The first industrial, agricultural, and transportation exhibition in the Tibet region opened in Lhasa on the 2nd.

At 3:30 PM, General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, cut the ribbon for the exhibition. Afterwards, Tibetan and Han leading cadres from various Lhasa institutions and military units, high-ranking Tibetan officials from the Tibetan local government, and representatives from religious circles accompanied General Zhang Jingwu to visit the exhibition.

The visiting crowd first came to the exhibition room of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region. Here was the first furnace of steel from the plateau, the first "Plateau Brand" tractor designed and manufactured by themselves with good performance, and the first trial-produced water pump, electric sawmill, steam rock drill and other production machinery in the Tibet region.

The exhibition room sponsored by the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Administration particularly aroused people's interest. The bureau's employees, for the first time ever, built an iron smelting furnace on the high Kunlun Mountains and smelted iron from ore.

People gathered for a long time in front of a map of the Tibet region's highways. On the map, the red lines of the highways were already connecting the major towns in Tibet, passing through fields, grasslands, and forests, and gradually extending to remote areas. The truck drivers who undertake transportation tasks on this four-thousand-kilometer plateau highway have created and improved more than a thousand kinds of components in just four months, which has greatly changed the face of plateau highway transportation.

The Tibet region mineral exhibition room was packed with people. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Liu Xia Tudeng Tagba, Kalon of the Tibetan local government, carefully asked the Tibetan narrators about the uses of these minerals and the process of finding them. The more than sixty kinds of mineral specimens on display made the visitors feel that the Tibetan Plateau was even richer and more lovable.

People finally visited the agricultural hall. The hundreds of new varieties of high-yielding crops that have been successfully trial-planted on the land of Tibet after liberation have greatly encouraged people's confidence in developing agricultural production on the plateau. This year, the grain harvested from the Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Station is already enough to supply seven hundred people for the whole year. The Tibet Military Region troops are also reclaiming wasteland for production, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in grain within three to five years.

### 西藏举行工农业和交通运输展览会

    西藏举行工农业和交通运输展览会
    据新华社拉萨3日电　西藏地区首次工农业和交通运输展览会，2日在拉萨市开幕。
    下午三时半，中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武将军为展览会剪彩后，拉萨市各机关、部队的藏、汉族负责干部，西藏地方政府的藏族高级官员，以及宗教界代表人士等即随同张经武将军进入展览会参观。
    参观的人群首先来到了人民解放军西藏军区的展览室，这里有高原上的第一炉钢，有他们自己设计自己制造出来的第一辆性能良好的“高原牌”拖拉机，还有西藏地区第一次试制成功的抽水机、电动锯木机、蒸汽开山机等生产机械。
    青藏公路交通运输管理局主办的展览室，特别引起了人们的兴趣。该局职工第一次破天荒地在高峻的昆仑山上修起了炼铁炉，用矿石炼出了铁。
    人们长久地围聚在一幅西藏地区公路图前面。图上，公路的红线已经联贯着西藏各主要城镇，穿过田野、草原和森林，逐步伸向边远地区。在这四千多公里的高原公路线上担负运输任务的汽车驾驶员们，在短短四个月里，就创造和改进了一千多种机件，对改变高原公路运输面貌起了很大的作用。
    西藏地区矿产展览室里挤得水泄不通。西藏自治区筹备委员会秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美，西藏地方政府噶伦柳霞·土登塔巴等人仔细地向藏族解说员询问这些矿产的用途和找寻的经过。这里陈列的六十多种矿产标本使参观的人们更加感到西藏高原富饶可爱。
    人们最后参观了农业馆。解放后在西藏土地上试种成功的几百种丰产农作物新品种，大大鼓舞了人们在高原上发展农业生产的信心。今年，拉萨农业试验场收获的粮食已经能供给七百人全年食用，西藏军区部队也正在开荒生产，争取三至五年内达到粮食自给自足。
