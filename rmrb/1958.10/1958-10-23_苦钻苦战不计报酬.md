    Endure Hardships and Tireless Work Without Regard to Remuneration
    Wei Changgeng, Worker at Tianjin No. 1 Food Processing Factory

    The wage system is a legacy from capitalist society. However, there is an essential difference between our implementation of the wage system and the wage system of the bourgeoisie. Under the capitalist system, the wage system is a means for capitalists to exploit workers; our wage system is a distribution system of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," where those who do not work do not receive wages, and there is no exploitation at all. Therefore, in the early stages of our country's construction, when the level of material production was still relatively low and people's awareness was not yet high enough, it was necessary to implement the wage system.

    However, this system, which is precisely the system of communism, still contains many unreasonable factors. For example, even if they are both eighth-grade workers, doing the same work and earning the same wages, because the number of family members is different, some people eat and dress well every day, while others don't eat and dress well enough. After the nationwide rectification campaign, when most workers can consciously work for socialism, this difference makes people feel that it is not very reasonable.

    After studying the general line of socialist construction, the political and ideological consciousness of the workers has been unprecedentedly improved. Take our factory as an example: during the Great Leap Forward, workers scrambled to endure hardships and work tirelessly, working around the clock day and night, without complaining of hardship or fatigue, and without regard to remuneration. Money, in the eyes of enlightened workers, is no longer the most valuable thing. Therefore, the current wage system should also be changed along with the development of production and the improvement of people's awareness. Now, workers have first voluntarily abandoned the piece-rate wage system, and then actively demanded the establishment of people's communes and the implementation of the supply system.

    苦钻苦战不计报酬
    天津市第一食品加工厂工人  魏长庚
    工资制是资本主义社会留下来的。但是，我们实行工资制同资产阶级的工资制有本质上的区别。资本主义制度下的工资制，是资本家用来剥削工人的手段；我们的工资制则是一种“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的分配制度，不劳动的人得不到工资，根本不存在剥削。因此，在我国建设初期，当物质生产水平还比较低，人们的觉悟还不够高的时候，实行工资制是必要的。
    但是，这种制度正是共产主义的制度，它还包含着许多不合理的因素。比如，同样是八级工，一样的劳动，一样的工资，因为家里人口多少不同，有人天天吃好的，穿好的，有人就吃的不够好，穿的不够好。这种差别，在经过全民整风以后，大部分工人都能自觉地为社会主义劳动的时候，就让人感到它不大合理了。
    经过社会主义建设总路线的学习，工人们的政治思想觉悟空前提高了。就拿我厂来说，在大跃进中，工人们争先恐后地苦钻苦战，不分昼夜连轴转，不叫苦、不喊累，不计较报酬。钱，在觉悟了的工人看来，已经不是最宝贵的东西了。因此，现在的工资制也应当随着生产的发展和人们的觉悟提高而有所改变。现在工人们首先自动放弃了计件工资制，接着又积极地要求建立人民公社，实行供给制。
