    The Rockefeller Family: A Pillar of American Colonialism
    Originally Published in the American "Worker's Weekly"
    Making a Fortune from War
    During World War II, due to the greatly increased consumption of gasoline by the armed forces, and because oil could be used to manufacture chemicals and weapons, the Rockefeller family made more than two billion in profits. It took the dynasty nearly half a century to acquire its first billion, but the next two billion took only about five years. From that time on, it has been the third stage of the dynasty's expansion.
    Oil remains the source of the Rockefeller family's wealth and power. By 1956, they and their partners controlled two-fifths of the capitalist world's oil production.
    This family has become a pillar of present-day American colonialism. In the seventeen years from 1939 to 1956, the profits from American oil companies' overseas investments increased twelvefold; in 1956, these companies' capital exports accounted for more than three-fifths of the total American capital exports. Their main company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, earned nearly three-quarters of its profits from abroad. The Rockefeller's Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) earned a net profit of $580 million in 1955, more than the family earned during the entire First World War. Where did such a large amount of dollars go? Manufacturing Instruments of Murder
    The heads of American big businesses know better than anyone else that after the war, they will sooner or later be threatened by a crisis of sales. In order to protect themselves from such changes, they have begun to invest more and more funds in the industry that buys from bourgeois countries—the industry that manufactures instruments of murder. Oil used to be the Rockefeller family's main reliance, but now they have a second reliance: the military industry.
    One can assume that the Cold War began in 1946. That year, the Rockefeller family and other American corporate oligarchs made the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction their policy.
    From the beginning, while World War II was still going on, the real control of the new atomic industry was seized by the Rockefeller family and the Morgan, DuPont, and other monopoly groups. Many prominent atomic experts and administrators, who officially represented the government, were actually employees of the oil dynasty.
    James Conant, chairman of the National Defense Research Committee, was appointed in 1941 as a member of the six-person Supreme Atomic Committee personally led by Roosevelt. He was the director of the Rockefeller Institute.
    Infatuated with Aggressive Policies
    A journal, which has always been considered a mouthpiece of the State Department, published an article advocating the construction of more American rocket bases on foreign territory. The author of this article, Henry Kissinger, is the director of the Special Studies Project of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
    Secondly, there is the "Open Skies" plan—a most stubborn aerial inspection plan designed to obstruct the reaching of an agreement on ending the Cold War. One of the drafters of this plan was Nelson Rockefeller.
    This June, the West launched a frenzied campaign on the issue of the Hungarian court's sentencing of the Nagy group. The most enthusiastic organizer of this campaign was the New York "Crusade for Freedom," which controls Radio Free Europe. The head of this organization is Eugene Holman, chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey.
    Even American newspapers admit that the American armed intervention in Lebanon was carried out on the orders of the Rockefeller family. The Rockefeller family and their associates invested 1.5 billion dollars in Middle Eastern oil fields and therefore hope to sacrifice the Arabs for greater business.
   Grasping Governmental Power
    It is no secret to everyone who the "brink of war" extremists are among the White House staff. The names most often mentioned are: former Rockefeller Foundation President and Secretary of State Dulles; his brother, former Rockefeller family advisor and CIA Director Allen Dulles; former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford, who also has close ties with the Rockefeller family; and Nelson Rockefeller, who until recently was the President's special advisor, and finally John Rockefeller III, also the head of the family at the moment, and is generally considered the main planner of the US Asian aggression policy.
    These people are the spokesmen for the number one financial empire. Other American reactionary politicians, military personnel, monopoly capitalists, and agents of monopoly capitalists also belong to this group of war provocateurs. But its nerve center is controlled by 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York.
      The "New York Compass" once wrote: "The State Department's policy is drafted in the offices of Standard Oil. From there it passes through the Pentagon in Washington, where it receives the approval of the war lords of the Department of Defense and Navy wearing gold-braided uniforms." That newspaper said, "When it arrives in the Secretary of State's office," it becomes government policy.
    Politicians loyal to the Rockefeller family are pushing America down the road to war for the sake of the billions of dollars the family has invested in the oil business and the war industry.

### 洛克菲勒家族——美国殖民主义支柱  原载美国“工人周报”

专栏：外论摘要

    洛克菲勒家族——美国殖民主义支柱
    原载美国“工人周报”
    大发战争横财
    第二次世界大战期间，由于武装部队汽油消耗量大大增加，由于可以用石油制造化学品和武器，洛克菲勒家族得到了二十亿以上的利润。这个王朝差不多花了半个世纪的时间才获得头十亿美元，后来的二十亿却只用了五年左右的时间。从那个时候起就是这个王朝的扩张的第三阶段。
    石油仍然是洛克菲勒家族的财富和势力的源泉。到1956年，他们和他们的合伙人控制了资本主义世界石油生产的五分之二。
    这个家族已经变成现今美国殖民主义的支柱。从1939到1956的十七个年头，美国石油公司在国外的投资的利润增加了十二倍；1956年这些公司输出的资本占到美国资本输出总额的五分之三还多。他们主要的公司，新泽西美孚石油公司，有将近四分之三的利润是从国外获得的。洛克菲勒公司开发沙特阿拉伯的阿美石油公司1955年净赚五亿八千万美元，比这个家族在整个第一次世界大战期间赚的还多。这样大量的美元都用到哪里去了呢？制造杀人工具
    美国大企业的头子们比别人都更清楚，在战争之后，他们迟早将受到销售危机的威胁。为了保护他们自己不致受到这种变故的影响，他们着手把愈来愈多的资金投到资产阶级国家当买主的工业中去——制造杀人工具的工业。以前石油是洛克菲勒家族的主要依靠，现在他们有了第二个依靠：那就是军事工业。
    人们可以认为冷战是在1946年开始的。那一年洛克菲勒家族和其他的美国企业寡头们把制造大规模毁灭性武器订为他们的政策。
    从一开始，在二次大战还在进行的时候，新的原子工业的真正控制权就由洛克菲勒家族以及摩根，杜邦和其他垄断集团攫取过去。很多著名原子专家和行政人员，在职务上代表政府，实际上是石油王朝的雇员。
    国防研究委员会主席詹姆斯·康南特在1941年被任命为由罗斯福亲自领导的六人最高原子委员会委员。他是洛克菲勒研究所所长。
    醉心侵略政策
    一个一向被认为是国务院喉舌的期刊刊载了一篇文章，鼓吹在外国领土上修建更多美国火箭基地。这篇文章的作者亨利·基辛格就是洛克菲勒兄弟基金会特别研究室主任。
    其次还有“开放天空”计划——这是一个最顽固的空中视察方案，目的是要阻挠就结束冷战达成协议。这个方案的起草人之一就是纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。
    今年6月西方在匈牙利法庭判处纳吉集团的问题上发起了一个疯狂的运动。这个运动最热心的组织者是控制着“自由欧洲”电台的纽约“自由十字军”。这个组织的首脑就是新泽西美孚油公司的董事长尤金·霍尔曼。
    甚至美国的报纸也承认，美国对黎巴嫩的武装干涉是在洛克菲勒家族的命令下干出来的。洛克菲勒家族和他们的同伙人在中东油田里投资十五亿美元，因此希望牺牲阿拉伯人做更大的生意。
  掌握政府大权
    在白宫人员中谁是“战争边缘”的极端分子，这对大家都不是秘密。经常最先提到的名字是：前洛克菲勒基金会主席国务卿杜勒斯；他的弟弟前洛克菲勒家族顾问、中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯；前任参谋长联席会议主席海军上将雷德福，他同样与洛克菲勒家族有密切联系；还有纳尔逊·洛克菲勒，仅在不久以前他还是总统的特别顾问，最后还有约翰·洛克菲勒第三，也是目前这个家族的首脑，通常被认为是美国亚洲侵略政策的主要策划人。
    这些人是头号金融帝国的代言人。其他的美国反动政客、军人、垄断资本家和垄断资本家的代理人也都属于这一个战争挑衅集团的。但是它的总枢纽是由纽约洛克菲勒广场三十号控制着。
      “纽约指南针日报”曾经写道：“国务院的政策是在美孚油公司的办公室里起草的。从那里它通过华盛顿的五角大楼，在那里获得国防部和海军部穿着饰金线的制服的军阀们的批准。”那家报纸说：“当它到达国务卿的办公室的时候”，就变成为政府的政策。
    效忠于洛克菲勒家族的政治家们，为了这个家族在石油企业和战争工业中投下的亿万美元，正在把美国推向战争的道路。
