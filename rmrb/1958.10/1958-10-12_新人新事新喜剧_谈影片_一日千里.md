New People, New Deeds, New Comedy
——On the Film "Leap Forward"
Wang Yunman

The film "Leap Forward" is a new comedy about new people and new deeds. It consists of three short stories. Here, I would like to discuss the short films "A Big-Character Poster" and "Everywhere the Sound of the Great Leap Forward."

The event reflected in "A Big-Character Poster" can be said to be extremely ordinary. It is set against the background of rural technical innovation and tells the story of a mother posting a big-character poster for her son and a younger sister posting one for her older brother, criticizing his conservative thinking. In this short film of only twenty minutes, the mother – this ordinary rural woman – is portrayed movingly. The film realistically and simply depicts the changes in her thinking and the growth of new moral concepts under the impetus of the new life. Originally, when she saw her children arguing with each other, she appeared as a "peacemaker," asking them to be tolerant of each other. This attitude was somewhat laughable! However, when she understood that the dispute between her children was related to the interests of socialism (the daughter's creation of using a small cart to spread fertilizer would greatly improve production efficiency, while the son, Xingwang, as the production team leader, was obstructing his sister from doing so), her attitude immediately changed, and she insisted on writing a big-character poster to criticize her son. Here, the film cleverly uses such a comedic plot: the mother asks her son to write a big-character poster on her behalf, but the big-character poster criticizes him himself, which puts Xingwang in a very embarrassing situation. This comedic plot is not only interesting and powerfully satirizes Xingwang, but also prominently portrays a rural woman with a communist style. In her view, even her own son must not be tolerated when he hinders the interests of socialism!

Such a character, this selfless communist style, is a feature of our era, and this is even more prominent in "Everywhere the Sound of the Great Leap Forward." This short film has more attention-grabbing elements in terms of subject matter and the handling of comedic conflicts.

If judged from the standpoint of rigid artistic principles, it is difficult for "Everywhere the Sound of the Great Leap Forward" to constitute any dramatic plot. There are no contradictions or conflicts between opposing forces. However, it is indeed a comedic short film that praises new people and new deeds. The richness of life has enriched the treasure trove of our new socialist comedy.

Every character who appears here, what they think and what they do, is all for the Great Leap Forward. This constitutes the foundation of the entire comedic plot and vividly expresses a new relationship between people.

The contradiction between Lao Dong, a warehouse keeper in a factory, and Xiao Xia, the person in charge of the club's performances, is so meaningful because neither of them is a lazy laggard. They are both wholeheartedly for the Great Leap Forward, but life is really changing too fast, and people's enthusiasm is really too amazing to keep up with! This has become the source of the film's comedy. Moreover, it is precisely in the resolution of this contradiction that people's communist spirit is embodied.

Lao Dong clearly agreed to perform Peking Opera at the club, but he was twenty minutes late, which made Xiao Xia very angry. If Lao Dong were really an irresponsible person, he should undoubtedly be seriously criticized. However, when things became clear, Lao Dong was late for the sake of the Great Leap Forward – the factory was busy producing unbreakable enamel, and Lao Dong was afraid that there would not be enough refractory bricks, so he leaped forward in his mind and took twice as many bricks for the workers as usual, which is why he was late. In this way, the whole atmosphere of the play completely changed, and the audience was attracted to the comedic situation.

This comedic contradiction unfolds more interestingly in the film – Lao Dong suddenly stops performing in the middle of the play and wants to return to the factory. What is this for again? Because the factory's production has leaped forward at a rapid pace again, and even if twice as many refractory bricks were prepared, it is still not enough. This made Xiao Xia anxious. This performance was not just general entertainment, but a report-of-good-news meeting for the production leap forward. The audience's hearts were tightly drawn, and seeing that these people were focused on their work and the Great Leap Forward, the contradiction could not be resolved. At this time, a crosstalk performer came to the rescue, improvising a crosstalk segment about the incident, making the audience laugh. How could the audience, who were in the midst of the Great Leap Forward every day, not understand this? However, the film did not end there, but inserted a scene of a famous actor passing by – when he learned about the whole process of this comedic event, he offered to take Lao Dong's place on stage, regardless of the fact that he had to go to a play and hadn't had dinner yet. This insertion not only made the structure of the film more complete, but also further illustrates the relationship between people in our new era: even if it is a matter that seems completely unrelated to oneself, even if one has other tasks, as long as the matter is related to the interests of the socialist construction cause, people will think of all possible ways to take on the responsibility. This truly embodies the communist style and spirit of "being concerned about the worries of the world before others, and enjoying the happiness of the world after others." It should be said that it is precisely because the film's authors have a keen sense of the new people and new deeds in our society's daily life that they were able to conceive such a comedic short film that embodies the spirit of our era and has a communist style. Of course, in "A Big-Character Poster," the director's hesitation can still be seen in the comedic handling, and the film has not been dealt with in a more complete comedic style. If more attention were paid to the use of comedic characteristics, the short film would achieve better comedic results.

    新人新事新喜剧
    ——谈影片“一日千里”
    王云缦
    影片“一日千里”是写新人新事的新喜剧。它由三个短故事组成。在这里我想谈谈其中的“一张大字报”和“处处跃进声”这两部短片。
      “一张大字报”反映的事件，可以说平常极了。它是以农村技术革新为背景，表现母亲给儿子、妹妹给哥哥贴大字报，批评他的保守思想的故事。在这个才二十分钟的短片里，母亲——这个普通的农村妇女，得到了动人的表现。影片真实朴素地描写了她在新生活的推动下的思想变化和新的道德观念的成长。原先，当她看到自己儿女互相争执时，她是以“和事佬”的姿态出现的，要他们彼此忍让着点。这种态度多少令人觉得有点可笑！但是，当她明白儿女间的这场争论关系着社会主义利益（女儿创造的用小车来撒肥，将大大提高生产效力，儿子兴旺作为生产队长，却阻挠妹妹这样做），她的态度立即有了改变，坚持要写大字报批评儿子。影片在这里，巧妙地运用了这样一段喜剧情节：母亲要儿子代写大字报，而大字报批评的正是他自己，这使兴旺处于十分尴尬的情景中。这个喜剧情节，不仅有趣，不仅有力地讽刺了兴旺，而且，突出地表现了一个具有共产主义风格的农村妇女。在她看来，即使是自己的儿子，在他妨碍了社会主义的利益时，也是决不能容许的！
    这样的人物，这种为公忘私的共产主义风格，是我们时代的特色，这一点，在“处处跃进声”中表现得更为突出。这部短片，无论在取材上，喜剧性的矛盾的处理上，都有更为引人注意之处。
    如果从刻板的艺术法则出发，“处处跃进声”是很难构成什么戏剧性的情节的。这里，并不存在什么正反面力量的矛盾、冲突等等。可是，它确是一部歌颂新人新事的喜剧短片。是丰富的生活丰富了我们社会主义新喜剧的宝库。
    这里出现的每一个人物，他们所想、所做的，都是为了跃进。这构成了整个喜剧性情节的基础，并且由此富有风趣地表现了一种新的人与人之间的关系。
    某工厂保管员老董和俱乐部演出负责人小夏之间的矛盾，其所以意味深长，是因为他们谁也不是个偷懒的落后分子，他们都同样一心一意为了大跃进，但生活实在是变得太快了，人们的干劲也实在是太惊人了，赶也赶不上！这就成了影片的喜剧性的源泉。而且，正是在这种矛盾的解决中，体现着人们的共产主义精神。
    老董明明说好了要去俱乐部演京剧，但却迟到了二十分钟，这就使得小夏大为生气。要是老董真是个不负责任的人，无疑应该对他进行严肃的批评。但是，事情一弄明白，老董迟到是为了大跃进——厂里忙着生产不碎搪瓷，老董怕耐火砖不够用，头脑一跃进，比往常多给工人领了一倍，这才迟到的。这样，整个戏的气氛就完全变了，观众被吸引到了喜剧性的情境之中。
    这个喜剧性的矛盾，随着在影片中更有趣的展开——老董正在演戏，突然又不演了，要回厂去。这又是为了什么？因为厂里生产又往前飞速地跃进了，即使多准备了一倍的耐火砖，还是不够用。这可急坏了小夏。这次演出并非一般娱乐，是生产跃进报喜大会。观众的心被紧紧吸引住，眼看这些人一心为了工作，为了大跃进，矛盾却无法解决。这时，相声演员救了急，将这件事即兴式地编了段相声，逗得观众哈哈大笑。自己天天在大跃进的观众，怎么会对这件事不谅解呢？但是，影片并没有到此就结束，又插入了一位名演员路过此地的戏——当他知道了这件喜剧性事件的前后经过时，便不顾自己还要去上戏、也不顾自己还没有吃晚饭，主动提出代替老董上场。这一穿插，不仅使影片的结构更为完整，而且，也更足以说明我们新时代的人与人的关系：即使是一件看来与自己全然无关的事，即使自己正有着另外的任务，只要这件事关系着社会主义建设事业的利益，人们就会想出一切办法担负起来。这真正体现了“以天下之忧为忧，以天下之乐为乐”的共产主义风格，共产主义精神。应该说，正由于影片作者对我们社会日常生活中的新人新事，有着敏锐的感受，才可能构思出这样一个体现了我们时代精神、具有共产主义风格的喜剧短片来。自然，“一张大字报”中，在喜剧处理上，还可以看得出导演的犹豫，还没有比较充分地按照喜剧样式来处理影片。如果更注意喜剧特点的运用，就会使这部短片取得更好的喜剧效果了。
