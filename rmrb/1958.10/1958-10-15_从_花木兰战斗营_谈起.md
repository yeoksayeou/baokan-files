    Starting with the "Hua Mulan Combat Battalion"
    Zhang Ke
    The news report "Hua Mulan Combat Battalion" (see page 3 of this newspaper, October 9th) reflects the grand spirit of the peasant masses in transforming nature and their selfless dedication to hard work. From this, people see the significant changes in the mental outlook of the broad masses of peasants, and the vibrant rural scene after the people's communes were established. It is therefore deeply moving and inspiring.
      "After the combat battalion was established, no one left their posts for ten days and ten nights, and the combatants passed their homes three times without returning." Some say this seems "too intense." But this is only the case for some people who do not participate in labor regularly or are afraid of labor. The working people, however, take it calmly and are used to it. In the eyes of the working people, the more intense the labor, the more pleasant it is. Didn't the "Hua Mulan Combat Battalion" talk and laugh, and even perform a bit of "Hua Mulan," and everyone enjoyed it? What the working people think about is how to labor more and better, and quickly add a bit more strength to socialism. As for sweat-soaked clothes and not seeing the children for a few days, those are minor matters. In the midst of intense labor, completing tasks one after another, they naturally produce a sweet and happy feeling, and nothing else. If it's not intense, they feel bored, and even complain that "their bones ache from being idle."
    This kind of thought and feeling of the working people is understandable. In the past, they also labored all year round, but not for themselves, but for those who did not work for a living. As for themselves? They lived a life where "every day was like an ox or a horse, not getting enough to eat, not getting enough to wear." The childhood experience of Wang Meirong, the commander of the Hua Mulan Combat Battalion, is a microcosm of the lives of the broad masses of peasants in the past. Now they are working for themselves, and in practice they understand that personal interests and current interests must depend on collective interests and long-term interests, and personal happiness must depend on the realization of the communist ideals of all the people. Therefore, they show unparalleled heroism in their labor, and are willing to work hard for a few years to enjoy happiness for ten thousand years.
    Only intense labor can obtain great happiness. From the severe winter last year to the scorching summer this year, cadres and the masses have never left the construction site, and they all eat and live in the fields. After such intense labor, they finally created a great harvest of grain and cotton throughout the country. On the basis of the great harvest, many people's communes have also implemented a grain supply system, regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of whether they can work or not, everyone eats without paying. The problem of eating that has worried farmers for generations has now been solved. Isn't this a great happy event? Such a great happy event comes from intense labor.
    Now, not only is it necessary to vigorously develop steel, but it is also necessary to vigorously develop autumn harvesting and planting and other work. These tasks all require being done more, faster, better, and more economically. Only in this way can we accelerate socialist construction and actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism. Building socialism and communism is originally a great and arduous undertaking that predecessors have not done before, and we must accelerate its construction, can it not be intense? Can we walk at a leisurely pace?

    从“花木兰战斗营”谈起
    张克
    “花木兰战斗营”这篇通讯（见本报10月9日第三版），反映了农民群众改造自然的宏伟气魄和刻苦耐劳的忘我劳动精神。人们从这里看到了广大农民精神面貌的重大变化，看到了人民公社化以后气象万千的农村情景，因而受到很大的感动和鼓舞。
      “战斗营成立后，十天十夜没有一个人离开岗位，战斗员三过家门不回家。”有人说这似乎“太紧张”了。但这只是对某些不经常参加劳动或是畏惧劳动的人来说是这样。劳动人民却处之泰然，习以为常。在劳动人民看来，劳动得越紧张就越愉快，“花木兰战斗营”不是有说有笑，甚至还来一段“花木兰”，大家乐个痛快吗？在劳动人民的头脑里所想的只是怎样劳动得更多更好，赶快为社会主义多增加一分力量。至于汗水湿透了衣衫，几天没看见孩子，那都是小事。在紧张的劳动中，接二连三完成了任务，他们自然而然产生一种甜蜜蜜、乐滋滋的感觉，别无其他。不紧张，他们倒觉得乏味，甚至苦恼地说“闲得骨头疼”。
    劳动人民的这种思想感情是可以理解的。过去，他们也是终年劳动，但不是为自己而是为了不劳而食的人。自己呢？过着“每天和牛马一样，吃不饱，穿不暖”的生活。花木兰战斗营营长王美荣幼年的经历，就是过去广大农民的生活缩影。现在为自己劳动了，而且在实践中间懂得了个人利益和目前利益必须依存于集体利益和长远利益，个人幸福必须依存于全体人民的共产主义理想的实现，因而他们在劳动中表现了无比的英雄气概，宁愿辛苦几年，享福万年。
    只有紧张的劳动才能获得伟大的幸福，从去年严寒的冬天，到今年酷热的夏天，干部和群众从没离开过工地，都吃住在田间。经过这样一番紧张的劳动之后，终于创造了全国粮食棉花大丰收。好多人民公社在大丰收的基础上，又实行了粮食供给制，不分男女老弱，不管能否劳动，一律吃饭不要钱。农民世世代代所焦心的吃饭问题，这一下就解决了。这不是大好喜事吗？这样的大喜事就是从紧张劳动中得来的。
    现在不仅需要大搞钢铁，而且还要大搞秋收秋种和其他工作。这些工作都要求搞得又多又快又好又省。只有这样，才能加速社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义积极准备条件。建设社会主义和共产主义，本来就是前人没有做过的伟大而艰巨的事业，而我们又要加速它的建设，这能不紧张吗？这能迈着方步走吗？
