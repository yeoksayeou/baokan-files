    Ode to Suzhou
    Zheng Zhenduo’s posthumous work

    Editor’s note: This is an essay written by Comrade Zheng Zhenduo this spring for the “Local Chronicles” column of this newspaper’s supplement. Shortly after submitting it, Comrade Zheng Zhenduo suggested that it not be published for the time being, as he felt that this article did not sufficiently reflect the new people and new events of the current Great Leap Forward. Unexpectedly, this essay has now become a posthumous work. Even now, readers can still appreciate the author's enthusiasm for praising the motherland and the delicate and moving descriptions.

    Suzhou, this paradise-like place, once you've visited it, you'll forever fall in love with it and cherish its memory. It is a typical city of Jiangnan, a water town, and a land of fish and rice.

    In springtime, vast fields of alfalfa blooming with purple flowers are interspersed with patches of bright yellow rapeseed flowers, and there are endless expanses of tender green, newly planted rice seedlings in the paddy fields. The colors themselves are a beautiful and boundless natural tapestry. Who doesn’t love these radiant and delicate colors that represent spring? It's much like Venus just emerging from the sea foam, her eyes still misty and full of bewildered intent (note). It is spring herself! On the ridges of the fields, various small flowers bloom, white, yellow, pink, and deep red. Clear spring water flows gurglingly along the large canals and small ditches. Small birds are singing. Men and women members of the cooperative, shouldering hoes and carrying small baskets, go to the fields early in the morning. They are competing with each other. The “Youth Shock Brigade” song resounds loudly into the clouds. They make spring even more active and spirited.

    Millions of pots of jasmine, *Aglaia odorata*, and roses have been moved out of the glass greenhouses and are competing to show off their beauty in the flower fields. From afar, one can smell the clear and fragrant aroma that is being sprayed out. Standing on the large rocks of Tiger Hill, gazing at the peach-red and willow-green mountain scenery, and at the more distant five-colored and mottled fields and the lakes and small rivers lying bright under the sunlight. The weather is always moist, and at any time there might be a spring rain, drifting down from the clouds.

    Walking on the stone embankments of the Lingering Garden and the West Garden, gazing at the flowing water of the Grand Canal, one chants in the mouth: “She does not pass by Hengtang Road, but I only watch her fragrant dust depart.” At the foot is a large patch of dark green vegetable garden, blooming with purple-black broad bean flowers. The aroma of the vegetable flowers, mixed with the smell of soil, which wafts into the nostrils from time to time, is sweet and intoxicating. In the West Garden’s back garden, which has a bit of wildness and desolation, tourists are waiting for the large warty-headed turtles to appear in the pond. The Lingering Garden's fascinating garden scenery attracts more out-of-town guests. There are also many gardens in the city, each with its own characteristics, enough for you to wander around for a day and a half. In the Lion Grove Garden's rockery caves, you can't help but gasp and exclaim in surprise as you squeeze through. The Humble Administrator’s Garden is no longer a desolate and dim garden with dozens of dilapidated old houses and hundreds of old trees that are about to wither and fall. It has become a great place to stroll around with renewed vigor. Of the Wang family's Charitable Estate, only a stretch of rockery and a few houses remain on the north side, but they still attract tourists with their unique charm. They are like small ornaments—no, they are not small; they are miniature versions of famous mountains and rivers, reduced to a space of just a few yards. This shows how much our ancestors loved nature and how they were able to shrink nature and move it into their homes. Looking out from a small window, aren't there several verdant banana trees, a exquisitely carved Taihu stone, and a few small flowers and trees? That makes that corner of the house vibrant with life and distant interest. The Hall of No Beams is a very solid ancient building. Canglang Pavilion is right by the water, with a vast and profound charm. China’s oldest “Astronomical Chart” and “Map of the World” are housed in the Confucius Temple. Many stone tablets recording the struggles of weavers have also been found in the Xuanmiao Temple and other places. These beautiful gardens and important historical sites not only provide the people of Suzhou and the workers, peasants, and soldiers of its surrounding areas with enjoyment and strolling, but, more importantly, they provide the workers and peasants of the Jiangnan area, especially of the great city of Shanghai, with surprise, comfort, and leisurely rest and happiness. The small potted landscapes that the people of Suzhou and Yangzhou are good at cultivating make the large and small gardens of Suzhou like large potted landscapes.

    Suzhou is not entirely a city for strolling and resting. It has a long history of struggle. Suzhou is a typical handicraft city in Chinese feudal society. Weaving workshops were established long ago, and the history of the weavers’ struggles is worth writing in several thick books. The people of Suzhou, with their "soft Wu dialect," seem very gentle, but they often stand at the forefront of the struggle, brave and indomitable, and persevering. It has produced many national heroes, revolutionary martyrs, and even model workers. Their stories are admirable and moving.

    Outside Suzhou city, there is Hanshan Temple, which is famous for the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Ji's poem, "Outside Gusu city, Hanshan Temple, the midnight bell reaches the passenger boat." In the early Qing Dynasty, the poet Wang Yuyang traveled by boat in the middle of the night to the temple in order to write a poem on the temple's mountain gate, writing the poem in ink on the gate and then leaving without even entering the main hall. Today, many people still go there because of its fame. There is a large bell, but it is no longer the original bell. It is said that the original bell was stolen by Japanese imperialists and its whereabouts are unknown. Today, this temple, which was originally desolate, has become very magnificent. There is a winding staircase building, which is very exquisite, and was moved from an old house in the city. The cost of moving, rebuilding, repairing, painting, etc., was only 5,000 yuan. The people of Suzhou are so good at building up their homes with diligence and frugality. It is said that those beautiful gardens were also tidied up to be "vivid and colorful" and beautiful with very little money.

    Many of Suzhou's arts and crafts, especially embroidery, brocade, etc., are the glory of the country and the wealth of the country. Its agricultural achievements belong to the national high-yield areas, supplying many cities, and its agricultural production technology and experience are worth promoting.

    Suzhou city and the people of Suzhou are diligent, frugal, modest, and warm, and yet so delightful and lovable. Anyone who has been there once is sure not to forget it.

   [Note] Venus is the goddess of love in Greek and Roman mythology. She was born from the foam of the sea. The Italian painter S. Botticelli painted a "Birth of Venus," which shows her misty and bewildered eyes when she was just born.

    苏州赞歌
    郑振铎　遗作
    编者按：这是郑振铎同志在今年春天为本报副刊“风土小志”栏所写的一篇散文。交来不久，郑振铎同志就建议暂时不要发表，他认为这篇文章没有能更多地反映当前大跃进的新人新事。不料这篇散文如今竟成为遗作，现在发表出来，读者们仍然可以体会到作者讴歌祖国大地的热情和细致动人的描写。
    苏州这个天堂似的好地方，只要你逛过一次，你就会永远地爱上了它，会久久地想念着它。它是典型的一个江南的城市，是水乡，又是鱼米之乡。
    春天的时候，一大片的开着紫花的苜蓿田，夹杂着一块块的娇黄色的油菜花儿的田，还有一望无际的嫩绿可喜的刚刚插好的稻秧儿的水田，那色彩本身，就是一幅秀丽无边的绝大的天然的图案画。谁不喜爱这表现着春天的烂缦而又娇嫩的颜色呢？很像维纳丝刚从海水泡沫儿里生了出来，一双眼睛还朦朦忪忪地带着惶惑之意（注）。它就是春天她自己！田埂上还开放着各色各样小花朵，白色的，黄色的，还有粉红色的，深红色的。清澈的春水，顺着大渠小沟，唂唂地流着。小鸟儿在叫着。合作社的男女社员们，一大早就肩负着锄头，手拿着小筐子下田去了。他们彼此在竞赛着。“青年突击队”歌，高响入云。他们把春天变得更活跃又有精神了。
    千万盆的茉莉花、代代花和玫瑰花都已从玻璃房里搬出来，在花田里竞媚斗艳，老远地，就嗅到那喷射出来的清馨的香味儿。站在虎丘山的大石块上，望着桃红柳绿的山景，望着更远的五色斑烂的田野和躺在太阳光底下放亮光的湖泊和小河流。天气老是润滋滋地，不知什么时候就会有一阵春雨，在云端飘洒下来。
    走在留园、西园一带的石塘上，望着运河的流水，嘴里吟着：“凌波不过横塘路，但目送芳尘去”，足傍有一大块深绿色的菜园，正开着紫中透黑的蚕豆花儿，那不时钻入鼻孔的菜花香，夹杂着泥土气味，甜甜地像要醉人。在西园的略带野趣和荒凉味儿的后花园里，有游人们在等候着大癞头龟在池塘里出现。留园的引人入胜的园景，吸引着更多的外地的客人们。还有城里的许多花园，个个有特色，够你逛个一天半天的，狮子林的假山洞，钻得你不禁嘻嘻哈哈地大惊小怪起来。拙政园不再是几十间东倒西歪的老屋和千百株将枯未倒的老树，显得凄凉暗淡的园林了，它成为精神百倍的大好的游逛的地方。汪氏义庄就剩下靠北面的一带假山和几间房子了，但还别有风趣的吸引着游人们，它们活像是小摆设，不，它们并不小；它们乃是模拟着名山大川而缩小之于寻丈之地的。这显出了我们老祖先们怎样地喜爱自然，又怎样地能够把自然缩小了搬运到家园里来。从一扇小窗里望过去，不是有几棵碧绿的芭蕉树，一峰玲珑剔透的太湖石，还有小小的几株花木么？那就显得那个屋角勃勃地有生趣、有远趣起来。无梁殿是一座很坚实的古建筑。沧浪亭就在水边，具有渺荡的深趣。中国最古老的“天文图”和“舆地图”就放在孔庙里。许多的记载织工们斗争的石碑，也在玄妙观等处发现。这些美好的园林，和重要的古迹名胜，不仅供应了苏州市人民自己和它四乡的工农兵的享用和游逛，而且，更重要的是给予江南一带的特别是大上海市的工农民以惊喜，以舒畅，以闲憩的休息和快乐。苏州人和扬州人所擅长培植的小盆景，这些苏州市的大大小小的园林，就活像是一座座的大盆景。
    苏州不完全是一个游逛的、休息的城市。它有长久的斗争的历史。苏州是中国封建社会的一个典型的手工业城市。织坊老早就成立了，织工们的斗争史值得写成厚厚的几本书。“吴侬软语”的苏州人民，看起来好像很温和，但往往是站在斗争的最前线，勇猛无前，坚忍不屈。它那里产生了不少民族英雄，革命烈士以至劳动模范，他们的故事是可歌可泣的，是十分地感动人的。
    苏州城外有一座寒山寺，那是以唐代诗人张继的一首“姑苏城外寒山寺，夜半钟声到客船”而著名的。清初诗人王渔洋，就为了要题一首诗在这寺的山门上，半夜里坐船赶到那里，在山门上用墨笔写了诗，然后就下船离开了，连大殿也没进。到了今天，还有不少人慕名而去到那里。有一口大钟，但已经不是原来的那口钟了，听说原来的钟是被日本帝国主义者盗去的，下落不明。如今，这座本来荒凉不堪的寺院，变成了很华美。有一座盘梯的楼，很精致，是从城里一个旧家搬来的，包括搬运、重建、修整、油漆等等费用，只花上五千元。苏州人民就是会那末勤俭起家的。听说那些美丽的园林，也都是花了不多的钱而都收拾得“有声有色”，漂漂亮亮。
    苏州的许多工艺美术品，特别是刺绣、云锦等等，乃是国家的光荣，也是国家的财富。它的农业的成就，乃是属于全国高产地区，供给着许多城市，其农业的生产技术和经验乃是值得推广的。
    苏州城和苏州人民是勤俭的，谦虚的，温暖的，却又是那末可喜可爱。凡是到过那里一次的人，准保不会忘了它。
   〔注〕?维纳丝是希腊罗马神话里的爱神，她是从海的浪沫里产生出来的，意大利画家S·BOTTCELLI画的一幅“维纳丝的诞生”，就表现出她刚出生时的双眼的朦忪惶惑之感。
