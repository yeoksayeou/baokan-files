Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: Taipei News - Chiang Kai-shek, in an interview with a "New York Herald Tribune" reporter on the 18th, again advocated that the Chiang Kai-shek group should "firmly grasp" Jinmen and Mazu. Chiang Kai-shek even clamored that "overthrowing the Communist regime on the Chinese mainland" "is not far off and will definitely not be a matter of years."

According to United Press International, Chiang Kai-shek also told the newspaper's reporter, Walter Briggs, that "no American official has ever (to the Chiang Kai-shek group) suggested" reducing the Chiang army stationed in Jinmen and Mazu. He said, "There hasn't even been a shadow of such a suggestion."

The reporter asked Chiang Kai-shek whether the purpose of the American weapons currently being given to Taiwan—including tanks and "Nike-Hercules" missiles—was to ultimately reduce the troops in Jinmen and Mazu. Chiang Kai-shek replied, "No one has made such a suggestion in any way." He emphasized that the decision to send these weapons to Taiwan was made "some time ago."

He repeated once again, "I don't believe any responsible American official has such an idea. I believe this is especially true among the American military and diplomatic personnel in the Taiwan area."

Referring to the meeting with Dulles, Chiang Kai-shek said that the purpose of this meeting was to "further strengthen our cooperation."

According to Kyodo News, when Chiang Kai-shek met with Kyodo News' Taipei correspondent Tadao Okuto on the 16th, he "praised" Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's recent remarks expressing his determination to act as a pawn for American aggression and stubbornly oppose the Chinese people. Chiang Kai-shek "expressed satisfaction" with Kishi Nobusuke's "resolute adherence to the anti-communist policy" and advocated that Japan and Chiang Kai-shek "strengthen cooperation" in this regard. Chiang Kai-shek also expressed "agreement" with Nobusuke Kishi's plot to establish a "Northeast Asia Alliance" between Japan, Chiang Kai-shek, and Syngman Rhee. Chiang Kai-shek clamored that the "security is closely related" between Japan, Taiwan, and Syngman Rhee.

    蒋介石冥顽不灵
    连日发出要推翻人民政权的梦呓
    新华社20日讯　台北消息：蒋介石18日在对“纽约先驱论坛报”记者的谈话里，又鼓吹蒋介石集团要“巩固地掌握”金门和马祖。蒋介石甚至叫嚣，“推翻中国大陆上的共产党政权”“已为时不远，肯定不会是几年以后的事情”。
    据合众国际社报道，蒋介石还对这家报纸记者华尔特·布里格斯说，“没有一个美国官员曾经（向蒋介石集团）提出过”要减少驻在金门和马祖的蒋军问题。他说，“连这样一个建议的影子都没有。”
    记者问蒋介石，现在正给予台湾的美国武器——包括坦克和“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹——的用意是不是要最终削减金门—马祖的军队。蒋介石回答说，“任何方面都没有提出过这样的建议。”他强调指出，这个送这些武器到台湾的决定，是在“前一些时候”作出的。
    他再一次重复说，“我不相信任何负责的美国官员有这种想法。我相信在台湾地区的美国军事和外交人员中尤其如此。”
    在谈到将同杜勒斯举行的会谈时，蒋介石说，这一次会谈的目的是为了“进一步加强我们的合作”。
    另据共同社报道，蒋介石16日在接见共同社驻台北记者奥户忠夫时，“盛赞”日本首相岸信介最近发表的决心充当美国侵略马前走卒、死硬敌视中国人民的谈话。蒋介石对岸信介“坚决奉行反共政策”“表示满意”，并且主张日、蒋在这方面“加强合作”。对于岸信介阴谋建立日本、蒋介石和李承晚三者间的“东北亚联盟”一点也表示“赞同”。蒋介石叫嚷，日本、台湾和李承晚三者之间的“安全是密切相关的”。
