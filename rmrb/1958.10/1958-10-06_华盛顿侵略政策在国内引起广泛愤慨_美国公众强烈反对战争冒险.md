Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Washington dispatch: A growing number of American Congressmen and political figures are asking the government to change its policy of playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait. With the Congressional elections in November approaching, they are increasingly feeling the pressure of the American electorate's strong opposition to war adventurism and demand for peace.

Following the recent criticism of the US government by Democratic leader Stevenson and many prominent Democratic senators, ten Democratic Congressmen sent a telegram to US President Eisenhower on the evening of the 4th, expressing their dissatisfaction with the government's Far East policy. They requested that a special session of Congress be convened to consider US policy. The telegram stated that the vast majority of their constituents are deeply disturbed by the government's actions on Jinmen.

Eight prominent Americans also jointly wrote an open letter to Eisenhower, requesting withdrawal from Jinmen and other Chinese coastal islands. The eight individuals are Senator Lehman, retired Major General Heister, prominent military commentator Millis, and Honorary Secretary of the Quaker Society, Pickett, among others.

Lehman also wrote a letter to the "New York Times" on the 4th, advocating a change in US policy towards the coastal islands. He said: "It is undoubtedly well known that these islands have historically been used as bases from which to harass ships entering the Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou, and from which to conduct intelligence activities against the (Chinese) mainland." He said, "These islands are a threat to the mainland." Lehman believes that it is strategically unnecessary and not useful for the United States to "defend" these islands.

Kentucky's influential Republican Senator Cooper said on the evening of the 3rd that the United States should not go to war for "the small Chinese coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu." He expressed disagreement with the US government's claim that "defending" Jinmen and Mazu is necessary to "defend" the "security" of the United States, Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, and that the US approach cannot be supported in the face of world opinion.

At the same time, American newspaper editorial departments continue to receive large numbers of letters from the public expressing indignation at Washington's policies. The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" published letters from a group of readers in St. Louis City, calling for "an immediate Congressional session to specifically study the dangerous situation in the Formosa region." They also condemned Dulles as an "arrogant and irresponsible person." The newspaper also published a letter from reader Jennings, criticizing Eisenhower and Dulles for disregarding public opinion on the Taiwan crisis.

The "Chicago Tribune" published a letter from Chicago resident Walling. He wrote: "We supported Chiang Kai-shek's blockade of mainland ports during China's civil war, and then accused the mainland Chinese government's attempts to break through this blockade as 'provocation' and 'aggression,' making us look ridiculous in front of the whole world. When we say that Taiwan and the islands in the Taiwan Strait are not part of China, and that the Taiwan regime is the government of China, we should beg the world not to laugh at us. But this is a laugh with tears, because our absurd actions will ruin many people if the American people do not stop them." The letter said, "Let us learn to live in the real world again, in this world where China accounts for a quarter of humanity, and not die for the fantasy of wanting Chiang Kai-shek to represent a quarter of humanity."

"Chicago Tribune" reader Stewart said, "Chiang Kai-shek's government is already a zombie, just like the government established by slave owners in the southern United States a hundred years ago."

The "Wall Street Journal" also published many letters condemning the US government's policies, considering them dangerous and provocative. One letter writer considered Eisenhower's television broadcast speech to be "hypocritical" and "incendiary." Sacramento, California resident Shack attacked US policy, saying it lacks flexibility and uses a "military attitude" to solve international problems.

### 华盛顿侵略政策在国内引起广泛愤慨  美国公众强烈反对战争冒险

    华盛顿侵略政策在国内引起广泛愤慨
    美国公众强烈反对战争冒险
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：越来越多的美国国会议员和政界人士要求政府改变在台湾海峡玩火的政策。在11月的国会选举即将到来的时候，他们日益感觉到美国广大选民强烈的反对战争冒险和要求和平的情绪的压力。
    继民主党领袖史蒂文森和许多有名的民主党参议员最近批评了美国政府之后，十名民主党众议员4日晚上打了一封电报给美国总统艾森豪威尔，对政府的远东政策表示不满。他们要求召开国会特别会议来考虑美国的政策。电报中说，他们的绝大多数选民都对政府在金门的作法深感不安。
    八个著名的美国人士也联名写了一封公开信给艾森豪威尔，要求从金门和中国其他沿海岛屿撤退。这八个人是参议员利曼、退伍少将黑斯特尔、著名的军事评论员米利斯和公谊会名誉秘书皮凯特等人。
    利曼4日还写了一封信给“纽约时报”，主张改变美国对沿海岛屿的政策。他说：“这些岛屿过去一直被用来作为基地，从那里骚扰驶入中国的厦门港和福州港的船只，并且从那里对（中国）大陆进行情报刺探活动，这无疑是众所周知的事情。”他说，“这些岛屿是对大陆的威胁。”利曼认为，美国要“保卫”这些岛屿从战略而言是不必要的，而且也不是有用的。
    肯塔基州有势力的共和党参议员库柏3日晚上说，美国不应该为“中国沿海小岛金门和马祖”而进行战争。他表示不同意，美国政府所谓“保卫”金门和马祖是“保卫”美国、日本、菲律宾、澳大利亚和新西兰的“安全”所需要的，美国的做法在世界舆论面前也是不能得到支持的。
    与此同时，美国各报编辑部继续收到大批人民来信，对华盛顿的政策表示愤慨。“圣路易邮报”刊载了来自圣路易城的一群读者来信，呼吁“立即召开国会会议，以便具体地研究福摩萨地区的危险局势”。他们并且谴责杜勒斯是一个“狂妄而不负责任的人”。这家报纸还发表了读者詹宁斯的信，批评艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在台湾危机问题上无视公众的意见。
    “芝加哥论坛报”刊载了芝加哥居民华林斯的来信。他写道：“我们在中国的内战中支持蒋介石对大陆港口所进行的封锁，然后又指责大陆中国政府冲破这种封锁的企图为‘挑衅’和‘侵略’，这样，我们就在全世界面前显得很可笑。当我们说台湾和台湾海峡的岛屿不是中国的一部分，说台湾的政权是中国的政府时，我们应当请求世人不要耻笑我们。但是，这是带着眼泪的笑，因为我们的荒唐作法会毁掉很多人，如果美国人民不加以制止的话”。信中说，“让我们学会重新在现实世界上生活吧，在这个世界里中国占人类的四分之一，不要为了想叫蒋介石代表四分之一人类的空想卖命吧”。
    “芝加哥论坛报”一位读者斯图尔特说，“蒋介石的政府已经是僵尸了，正如一百年前奴隶主在美国南部所建立的政府一样”。
    “华尔街日报”也刊登很多来信谴责美国政府的政策，认为它是危险的和挑衅性的。有一个写信的人认为艾森豪威尔的电视广播演说是“虚伪透顶的”、“煽动性的演说”。加利福尼亚州萨克腊门托城居民夏克抨击美国的政策，说它缺乏灵活性和以“军事态度”解决国际问题。
