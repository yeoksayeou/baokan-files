    Frontline Poetry Selections
    Sending snacks-bombs angrily fly to Jinmen, specially targeting the traitorous Chiang bandit troops, peaceful calls you don't heed, today we invite you to eat snacks.
            Soldier Xu Yaoru
    The sea and cannons, a thunderclap bursts in the clear sky, a "roast chicken" (Note) falls from the sky. The sea shouts "Well done!", opening its big mouth to swallow it. Waves raise bouquets and run towards the shore, bowing repeatedly to thank the cannon: Cannon, cannon, you are so good, the "roast chicken" is roasted with such a delicious taste! The cannon lowers its head and laughs heartily, it is my master's high skill.
        (Note) Chiang bandit plane hit, caught fire and fell into the sea.
    Soldier Yongle
    An order, an order passed down, thousands of cannons fire together, ten thousand fire dragons cross the strait, flowers bloom on Jinmen Island. The enemy阵 is a sea of fire, hundreds of bandits "go home", warships are dismembered and sink under the sea, provocation deserves punishment!
            Soldier Sun Qiqing
    Don't blame Wu Song
    Now there are 600 million Wu Songs, unfortunately the tiger is made of paper, if the paper tiger really wants to seek death, don't blame Wu Song for being impolite.
            Soldier Que Changlu

    前线诗抄
    送点心炮弹愤怒飞金门，专找卖国蒋贼军，和平召唤你不听，今朝请你吃点心。
            战士　许耀如
    海和大炮一声霹雳晴空爆，一只“烧鸡”（注）从天掉。大海高呼打得好，张开大口就吞掉。浪举花束朝岸跑，鞠躬连连谢大炮：大炮大炮你真好，“烧鸡”烧的口味妙！大炮低头哈哈笑，是我主人技术高。（注）被揍中着火掉下海的蒋
        贼机。
    战士永乐
    一声号令一声号令下传，千门大炮齐发，万条火龙越海峡，金门岛上开花。敌阵一片火海，几百贼众“回家”，兵舰分尸沉海下，挑衅应得惩罚！
            战士　孙启庆
    莫怪武松如今武松有六亿，可惜老虎是纸的，纸虎若真要找死，莫怪武松不客气。
            战士　阙昌禄
