Xinhua News Agency report: Northern Vietnam's autumn rice harvest looks promising. Except for the early-maturing rice that is already being harvested, the autumn rice has already headed. In the fertile Red River Delta, known as the granary of North Vietnam, the endless rice fields are full of autumn crops and the crops are growing vigorously. The good harvest is unprecedented in Vietnamese history.

These days, the rural areas of Northern Vietnam are filled with joy, and farmers in many places are increasing the number of bamboo circles and bamboo urns for storing grain in preparation for the harvest.

The appearance of experimental fields has brought new joy to Vietnamese farmers. At present, there are too many experimental fields spontaneously set up by people in various parts of Northern Vietnam based on the Chinese experience introduced in the newspapers to be counted for the time being. Although these experimental fields are generally not highly densely planted, the production situation is basically good. The most noteworthy are those experimental fields that are set up more fully in accordance with the planting method of China's "satellite" fields. There are currently more than 100 such fields in Vietnam. Among them, an experimental field at the Hanoi Suburban Agricultural and Forestry University has a density of 2,000 seedlings per square meter, an average of seven ears per plant, and an average of more than 170 grains per ear. Farmers from hundreds of kilometers away have come to see it after hearing about it. Other experimental fields have also become objects of visits by farmers from various places.

This autumn, in addition to the planting area of rice in Northern Vietnam exceeding the original national plan by 3.5% and exceeding the autumn rice area of last year by 4.9%, the density of many rice fields has increased compared with previous years. In addition, the work of deep plowing, fertilization, water conservancy, pest control, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been carried out better than in previous years, so this year's autumn rice harvest is stronger than in previous years. According to officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year's summer rice suffered partial yield reductions due to severe drought, and the autumn rice must yield two tons per hectare (the average last year was 1.8 tons) to achieve "making up for the summer with the autumn" and complete the national plan. Judging from the current situation, according to the most conservative estimate, it is not a problem to harvest two tons per hectare, and it will definitely exceed that.

Recently, good news about the bumper harvest of early-maturing autumn rice in Northern Vietnam has frequently come from various provinces.

According to reports from the suburbs of Hanoi and the provinces of Hai Duong, Ha Dong, and Jian An, the amount of dry grain harvested by farmers in many places has increased by one to more than two times compared with last year. The highest unit area yield currently known has increased from 1.7 tons per hectare in previous years to the current 4.6 tons (that is, from an average of more than 220 jin per mu to more than 610 jin per mu). Even the early-maturing rice in the Viet Bac and Northwest minority areas, which have always had the worst harvests, has seen leap-forward fields yielding more than 4 tons per hectare.

### 越南北方秋稻丰收在望  年景之好史所未有　高产喜讯频频传来

    越南北方秋稻丰收在望
    年景之好史所未有　高产喜讯频频传来
    新华社讯　越南北方秋稻丰收在望。各地除了早熟稻已经在收割之外，秋稻都已抽穗。在号称北越粮仓的丰饶的红河三角洲里，一望无际的稻田上秋实累累、庄稼茁壮，年景之好为越南历史上所未见。
    这些天越南北方农村到处喜气洋洋，许多地方的农民都在增编装粮用的竹圈、竹瓮准备迎接丰收。
    试验田的出现为越南农民带来了新的喜悦。目前越南北方各地人民根据报上介绍的中国经验自发搞起来的试验田，多得一时无法统计。这些试验田虽然一般还不算高度密植，但生产情况基本良好。最引人注意的是那些比较充分按照中国“卫星”田的种植法搞起来的试验田，它目前在越南共有一百多块。其中，河内南郊农林大学的一块试验田，每平方公尺密植达二千蔸，每株平均有七穗，每穗平均结了一百七十多颗谷粒。几百公里外也有农民闻名前来观看。其它试验田也都成为各地农民参观的对象。
    今年秋天越南北方的稻子除了种植面积已经超过国家原订计划3.5％、超过去年秋稻面积4.9％之外，许多稻田的密植度都比往年增加。加上深耕、施肥、水利、除虫等工作和互助合作运动开展的比往年好，所以今年的秋稻年景比往年都要强。据农林部负责人士说，今年夏稻由于严重干旱而部分减产，秋稻必须每公顷收二吨（去年平均为一点八吨）才能做到“以秋补夏”，完成国家计划。从目前情况看来，根据最保守的估计每公顷收二吨也不成问题，而且一定会超过。
    最近越南北方秋造早熟稻丰产的喜讯频频从各省传来。
    据河内郊区以及海阳、河东、建安等省报告，不少地方的农民收获的干谷数量，比去年增加了一倍到两倍多。现在获悉的最高单位面积产量，已经从往年的每公顷一吨七提高到目前的四吨六（也就是说由平均每市亩产二百二十余斤提高到产六百十余斤）。连一向收成最差的越北和西北少数民族地区的早熟稻，也出现了每公顷收四吨多的跃进田。（附图片）
