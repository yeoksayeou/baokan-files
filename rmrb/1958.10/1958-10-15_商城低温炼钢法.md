Features of the "Low-Temperature Steelmaking Method"

1.  Local materials, local use.  White iron produced by local blast furnaces can be directly refined into low-carbon steel (collected waste pots and scrap iron can also be used as steelmaking raw materials).  Both cold iron and hot metal can be used for steelmaking.  No modern equipment is needed, and no ferroalloys are added.  The fuel used is firewood and charcoal. Although the chemical composition and mechanical properties of the steel have not been scientifically analyzed, its properties and effectiveness have been proven by years of practice to be comparable to low-carbon round, square, and flat steel materials refined by Western methods.  Now it is not only used to manufacture various agricultural tools, implements, tools, and building materials, but also to manufacture new parts such as ball bearing races.

2.  Simple equipment, quick furnace construction, low cost, and considerable output.  The indigenous steelmaking furnace itself is made of yellow earth and sand, using only three small iron plates and six iron nails.  Steelmaking tools consist of a bellows, four iron bars, five iron hammers, and two iron anvils.  A pair of steelmaking furnaces can be built in one twelve-hour shift.  Building a pair of furnaces (using one in rotation) costs only about 300 yuan.  One shift can refine 1,500 jin of steel (divided into eight to nine heats, each heat taking eighty to ninety minutes), and one furnace can refine 1.5 tons of steel in two shifts a day.

3.  Few people are needed, the organization is flexible, and the technology is easy to learn.  Each steelmaking furnace requires eight people per shift: one steelmaker, two tong operators (who hold the steel ingot during forging), four hammerers (who strike the steel ingot), and one person to pull the bellows.  The three people who make steel and operate the tongs can replace each other.  The five people who hammer and pull the bellows can also replace each other.  Labor intensity can be adjusted.

With careful study, steelmaking techniques can be mastered for independent production in ten days to half a month.

4.  Steelmaking saves pig iron, and the amount of fuel used is not excessive.  Each ton of steel uses 1.15 tons of cold pig iron, and only about 1.1 tons if hot metal is used.  Each ton of steel uses about 120 kilograms of firewood and charcoal combined. If hot metal is used for steelmaking, only about 50 kilograms of firewood and charcoal are needed.  The ratio of fuel to steel is about one-tenth to one-twentieth.  If high-quality coal or coke is gradually substituted, the fuel problem will be easier to solve.

Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking method also has shortcomings: the steel ingots produced are relatively small (each generally weighs about three jin, but can also be forged to about six jin).  It is convenient for making small items, but for making large items, hot joining is required during forging, which is more cumbersome.

It is estimated that the low-carbon steel refined by Shangcheng's indigenous method can be used to prepare medium-carbon, high-carbon, and alloy steel if it is refined again in crucibles.

The principle of Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking method and Western converter steelmaking is essentially the same: blowing air to oxidize impurities (carbon, silicon, etc.) in the iron.  However, its advantage is that steelmaking is carried out at low temperatures and in a colloidal state. Unlike converter steelmaking, it does not require high-temperature molten iron. Therefore, it does not require the raw pig iron to have a high or low silicon content, and it does not need to add ferroalloys to aid combustion.  Therefore, it can both adapt to the specific situation of the inconsistent composition of pig iron from indigenous iron smelting furnaces and get rid of the dogma of needing to add ferrosilicon when smelting steel with low-silicon iron.

Furnace Construction

1. Furnace Base

The furnace base must be selected in a dry location.

2. Building the Furnace

After selecting the furnace base, dig a furnace chamber approximately 170 cm long, 100 cm wide, and 90 cm deep. One furnace chamber can be used for two furnaces. After digging, build up an 18 cm thick layer of yellow sandy soil. At the center of each end, 40 cm apart, erect a wooden stake about the thickness of a teacup (the thickness should not exceed the size of the furnace bottom, about 24 cm). Then, build up the soil in layers, six times in total. Each time the soil is added, use a wooden lever to compact it firmly before adding the next layer, until it is level with the ground. The furnace chamber is then built.

The furnace chamber should be built with yellow sandy soil, with coarse sand accounting for 35% to 45%. The standard for yellow sandy soil is: when dry, the yellow sandy soil is dug up in pieces. After digging, break it up and mix it well for use. If yellow sandy soil cannot be found, yellow clay can also be broken up, mixed with sand, and mixed with about 40% coarse sand (generally mixed three times repeatedly) for use. When building the furnace chamber, the moisture content of both types of soil should be appropriate: it should be possible to squeeze it into a ball by hand, and it should break when dropped on the ground.

3. Digging the Furnace (Furnace Hearth)

Smooth the top of the furnace chamber with a wooden pat. Then, pull out the wooden stakes and start digging the furnace. Dig a furnace hearth in the shape of an orange. The diameter of the furnace hearth should be 62 cm, the diameter of the furnace bottom 28 cm, the diameter of the furnace mouth 31 cm, and the depth from the furnace bottom to the furnace mouth 38 cm. Tools for digging the furnace: 1. Bamboo (wood) cross ruler (for determining the size of the furnace bottom, 28 cm straight); 2. Digging shovel; 3. Scraper (for smoothing); 4. Two-section sliding ruler (for measuring the size of the furnace hearth).

Digging the furnace should not be rushed. Pay attention to maintaining the curvature from the furnace mouth to the furnace belly and from the furnace bottom to the furnace belly; otherwise, the wind force will not be uniform inside the furnace, and the output and quality of the steel will be affected.

4. Installing the Sky Gate Cover (i.e., the Furnace Cover)

1. First, prepare the sky gate cover (furnace cover) and chisel an air inlet. The air inlet should be large enough to fit two fingers, about 3 cm in diameter (generally one-twentieth of the maximum diameter of the furnace hearth). Chisel the inlet at the center about 8 cm from the flat edge. After chiseling the air inlet, place the sky gate cover on the furnace mouth, leaving a charging port (which is also a steel outlet) at the front of the furnace mouth. The standard is that a vertical line dropped from the air inlet, with the center of the air inlet aligned with the center of the furnace bottom, is appropriate. It should not be biased, so that the wind blows down forcefully and operates normally inside the furnace.

2. The charging port (which is also a steel outlet) is called the furnace door. Its dimensions are: 17 cm left and right, 20 cm front and back (it is necessary to measure a distance of 20 cm from the flat edge of the sky gate cover and shovel away a portion of the furnace mouth). On the left and right sides of the furnace door, erect pieces of pig iron bricks, 28 cm high, 20 cm wide, and 0.8 cm thick, and fasten them with climbing nails, with one end buckled into the mud of the furnace nest. Place a piece of iron brick 50 cm long, 20 cm wide, and 0.8 cm thick flat on the front of the furnace door and fasten it with furnace door nails on the left, right, and front sides (inserted into the mud).

3. To make the sky gate cover, mix yellow clay with 40% coarse sand and water, and beat it into a large mass. One sky gate cover requires a 70-jin ball of mud, made into a large semi-circular mud plate, 53 cm long, 43 cm wide, and 3 cm thick (three fingers thick). First, pat it lightly with a grass pat (a wooden pat with rope), then pat it with a smooth wooden pat after two days. Do not expose it to sunlight; it should only be dried in a breezy shade. After about seven to ten days, bake it dry over a slow fire, and it is ready for use. Several sky gate covers should be prepared in advance before building the furnace.

4.  Furnace Nest

The furnace nest is made of ordinary yellow sandy mud with a little grass tendons and water. The height and size of the furnace nest can be determined according to the worker's usage habits, generally about 70 cm high. Its purpose is mainly to block the material and protect the air duct. The air duct is made of thick sheet iron, shaped like a cow's horn. One end is aimed at the air inlet of the sky gate cover, and the other end is exposed from the middle of the back of the furnace nest, facing the air outlet of the bellows, with a short pipe connected in the middle. The wind drawn by the bellows enters the furnace through the air duct.

Steelmaking with Cold Pig Iron (Cold Charging)

1.  Prepare the following tasks before production:

(1) Material Preparation: For one shift of production per day, working for twelve hours, prepare 1,500 jin of pig iron plates (i.e., white iron, hammered into small pieces the size of half a palm) or waste pots, scrap iron, 120 to 170 jin of charcoal, and 80 to 100 jin of firewood to start production for the day. For two shifts of production per day, double the material preparation.

(2) Organize the tools and mud materials.

(3) The new furnace must be dried with fire, and then blown with a bellows to create a large fire. Generally, drying for two to three hours is sufficient.

2.  Batching and Operation

According to one shift of production per day, use 1,500 jin of white iron or waste pots and scrap iron to refine 1,280 jin of low-carbon steel. According to two shifts of production per day, use about 3,000 jin of white iron or waste pots and scrap iron to refine 2,560 jin of low-carbon steel. The refined steel is about 85% to 90% of the pig iron.

(1) Divide 1,500 jin of pig iron, 80 to 100 jin of firewood, and 120 to 170 jin of charcoal into eight to nine heats of steel, with each heat containing 166 jin of pig iron, 15 to 20 jin of charcoal, and 10 to 12 jin of firewood. Each smelting time is eighty to ninety minutes.

(2) Material loading sequence: First load 7 jin of firewood, then 100 jin of pig iron, 8 jin of charcoal, close the furnace door, and pull the bellows for about fifteen to twenty minutes. After the iron is heated and turns red, open the iron door, level the material, and add the second batch of material. The second batch contains 5 jin of firewood, 66 jin of pig iron, and 6 jin of charcoal. Close the furnace door and continue smelting. After about ten minutes, white sparks emerge from the upper part of the furnace door, the center of the furnace turns white, and the surroundings turn red. Open the furnace door and start stir-frying the iron.

(3) Operating method: Open the furnace door and level the material with a large bar. The pig iron in the furnace begins to break into pieces. Stir where it breaks. Use a bar to push the burning red small iron pieces to the air inlet, and the iron will break. Then, push the unbroken iron pieces around the perimeter to the center for forging. Repeat this stirring for about fifteen minutes. Most of the iron becomes loose. Use a small bar to turn the small steel pieces at the air inlet into lumps, each weighing 2.5 to 3 jin, about the size of two fists. Blow air on all sides of the steel lumps under the air inlet until the steel lumps turn white. Clamp them out for forging. If the operation is not good and large lumps are formed, the large lumps should be sent to the air inlet, blown for a moment, and then hit firmly twice at the place where the wind is blowing to break the large lumps, so as to prevent them from becoming larger and larger. When the steel lumps are clamped out for forging, they should be tapped lightly first to prevent them from scattering. The steel lumps are forged into a rectangular shape. After they turn purple-red, they are hit hard. After the steel lumps turn black, tap them lightly a few more times. Generally, each piece of steel should be hit more than one hundred times. The forged steel lumps are flat on all sides, each weighing about three jin.

Each time a steelmaking furnace refines steel, it is necessary to rake slag and repair the furnace according to the condition of the furnace.

Steelmaking with Hot Metal (Hot Charging)

If there is an iron smelting furnace near the steelmaking furnace that can supply hot metal, hot metal can be directly used for steelmaking.

About 200 jin of hot metal can be used for each heat. Generally, indigenous furnaces produce about 100 jin of iron each time, so two iron smelting furnaces can be paired with one steelmaking furnace.

When directly using hot metal for steelmaking, first put 7 to 10 jin of charcoal in the furnace, and then inject the hot metal. The hot metal is best to be thick. If it is too thin (i.e., too hot), it must be cooled for a while before injecting it into the furnace to prevent it from sticking to the furnace wall and damaging the furnace.

After injecting the hot metal, pull the bellows and start stirring. After stirring for fifteen to twenty minutes, the steel can be turned into lumps with a small bar, and then taken out one by one for forging, the method is the same as above. One heat of steel is finished in one hour.

The advantages of direct steelmaking with hot metal: (1) Saves labor (labor for breaking iron and feeding materials); (2) Saves charcoal and firewood; (3) Fast (saves the time for heating iron blocks); (4) The steel output rate is higher than using pig iron (average 90%, up to 93%).

Production Tools

Two large iron bars for stirring iron (each weighing about 40 jin), two small iron bars (each weighing about 25 jin), five iron hammers for hitting steel (each weighing 4 jin, one spare), three iron tongs for clamping steel (one spare), one pair of firewood tongs, two iron anvils for hitting steel (each weighing about 40 or 50 jin, cast from pig iron), one slag rake, one small rake for loading materials, one bamboo sieve (for sifting out steel scraps and iron filings splashed out during steel hitting. Large steel scraps can be returned to the furnace). (Attached picture)

    商城低温炼钢法
    冶金工业部工作组
    “低温炼钢法”的特点
    1、就地取材，就地使用。能用土高炉炼的白口生铁，直接炼成低炭钢（搜集的废锅、废铁作炼钢原料也可以）。既能用冷铁炼钢，也能用热铁水炼钢。既不用现代化设备，也不要加任何铁合金。用的燃料是劈柴、木炭。虽然钢的化学成分、机械性能等还没有经过科学分析，但其性质与效用，经过长年的实践证明，与洋法炼的低炭圆、方、扁钢料不相上下。现在不仅用以制造各种农具、器具、工具和建筑器材，而且制造滚珠轴承套等新式零件。
    2、设备简单、建炉快、花钱少、产量不小。土法炼钢炉本身用黄土加砂搪成，只用三个小铁板，六个铁钉。炼钢工具是风箱一只、铁杠四根、铁锤五个、铁砧两个。一班工作十二小时，就可以建起一对炼钢炉。建一对炉子（轮流使用一个）只要花三百元左右。一班能炼钢一千五百斤（分八至九炉炼，每炉八十至九十分钟），一炉一天两班能炼钢一吨半。
    3、用人不多，组织灵活，技术容易学会。每个炼钢炉上，每班八人，一人炼钢，两人掌钳（锻钢时钳钢块），四人打锤（打钢块），一人拉风箱。炼钢、掌钳的三个人，工作可以互相替换。打锤、拉风箱的五个人，也可以互相替换。在劳动强度上可以调剂。
    炼钢技术用心学，十天半月，就能独立生产。
    4、炼钢节约生铁，用燃料也不算多。每吨钢用冷生铁一点一五吨，如用热铁水只要一点一吨左右。每吨钢用劈柴、木炭共约一百二十公斤，如用热铁水炼钢，只要劈柴、木炭五十公斤左右。燃料与钢的比例约在十分之一到二十分之一之间。如逐步代用优质煤或焦，燃料问题更易解决。
    商城土法炼钢也有缺点：生产的钢块较小（每块一般重三斤左右，也可打六斤左右的），打小件东西方便，打大件东西，则需在锻打时热接，较费手续。
    商城土法炼的低炭钢，如用坩埚再炼，估计可配制中炭、高炭、合金钢。
    商城土法炼钢与洋法转炉炼钢的道理，本质上是一致的：即用空气吹炼，氧化掉铁中杂质（炭、矽等）。但它的优点是在低温、胶体状态炼钢，不像转炉炼钢那样，一定要用高温铁水炼钢，所以不要求生铁原料中含矽高低，也不需要外加铁合金去助燃。因此，既能适应土炼铁炉生铁成分不定的具体情况，又摆脱了用低矽铁炼钢需加矽铁的教条束缚。
            建　炉
    一，炉基
    炉基必须选在干燥地点。
    二，筑炉
    炉基选好后，挖一左右长一百七十公分，前后一百公分，上下九十公分深的炉膛，这样一个炉膛可供两个炉子用。挖成后，筑上十八公分厚的黄砂土，在两头各距四十公分的中心，各树立一个茶杯粗的木桩（粗细不超过炉底尺寸，约二十四公分），然后分层筑土，分六次筑齐，每上一次土用木杠筑结实，再上一次土，直筑到地平，炉膛就算筑成。
    筑炉膛要用黄砂土，里面粗砂要占35％至45％。黄砂土标准是：干的黄砂土，挖起来是一片一片的，挖后打碎拌匀备用。如果找不到黄砂土，也可用黄粘土打碎掺砂，掺入40％左右粗砂拌匀（一般反复拌三道）备用。在筑炉膛时，这两种土所含水分要合适，用手抓起来可捏成团，摔在地上能跌碎。
    三，挖炉（炉缸）
    把炉膛上面用木拍打光平，然后拔掉木桩，开始挖炉。挖成橘子形的炉缸。炉缸直径挖到六十二公分，炉底直径二十八公分，炉口直径三十一公分，炉底到炉口深三十八公分。挖炉用的工具：一、竹（木）十字尺（定炉底尺寸用，直行二十八公分）；二、挖炉铲；三、刮刀（刮光用）；四、两节滑动尺（量炉缸尺寸用）。
    挖炉不能操之过急，要注意保持炉口到炉腹、炉底到炉腹的弧度，否则风力在炉内运转不匀，钢的产量和质量都要受到影响。
    四，安装天门盖（即炉盖）
    一、先将天门盖（炉盖）备好，凿一个进风眼。进风眼大小可以伸进两个指头，直径约三公分（一般为炉缸最大直径的二十分之一），在距平边约八公分的中心处凿眼。进风眼凿好后，把天门盖盖在炉口上，炉口前部留一进料口（同时也是出钢口），其标准是从进风眼里掉下垂直线，进风眼的中心要对准炉底的中心为合适，不能有所偏倚，这样风打下去有力，并在炉内运转正常。
    二、进料口（同时也是出钢口）叫做炉门。其尺度为：左右十七公分，前后二十公分（需从天门盖平边量出二十公分距离，铲去一部分炉口），炉门左右各树立一块高二十八公分、宽二十公分、厚零点八公分生铁砖，用爬钉扣住，一头扣在炉窝的泥里。炉门前端平放一块长五十公分、宽二十公分、厚零点八公分的铁砖，左右前三面用炉门钉扣住（插在泥里）。
    三、天门盖的做法，用黄泥土掺40％的粗砂，用水拌合，要打熟成一大团，一块天门盖要七十斤重的一个泥团，做成一块大半圆形的泥板，长五十三公分，宽四十三公分，厚三公分（三指厚），先用草拍（木拍子上加绳）轻拍，两天后用光木拍打，不可在日光下晒，只宜风吹阴干为好，大约七天至十天后，用文火烤干，即可使用。在筑炉之前，应预先准备好几个天门盖。
              五、炉窝
    炉窝是普通黄砂泥土加少许草筋和水打熟后制成的。炉窝的高低大小，可随工人使用习惯而定，一般高约七十公分，它的用途主要是起拦料和保护输风管的作用。输风管是用厚铁皮做的，牛角形，一头对准天门盖的进风眼，另一头从炉窝背后中部露出，对住风箱的出风口，中接短管。风箱拉起的风，从输风管进入炉内。
      用冷生铁炼钢（冷装）
    一、在生产前要作好以下几个工作
      （1）备料：每天一班生产，工作十二小时，要准备生板（即白口铁）一千五百斤（锤成半个手掌大的小块）或废锅、碎铁、木炭一百二十斤至一百七十斤，木柴八十至一百斤，即可开始这一天生产。每天两班生产，备料加倍。
      （2）整理好工具和泥料。
      （3）新炉子要用火烘干，再用风箱吹大火，一般烘二至三小时即可。
          二、配料和操作
    按每天一班生产，用白口铁或废锅、废铁一千五百斤，炼成低炭钢一千二百八十斤。按每天两班生产，用白口铁或废锅、废铁约三千斤，炼成低炭钢二千五百六十斤。炼成的钢约为生铁的85％至90％。
      （1）把一千五百斤生铁、八十至一百斤木柴、一百二十至一百七十斤木炭，分作八到九炉钢用，每炉配生铁一百六十六斤，木炭十五至二十斤，木柴十至十二斤，每次冶炼时间为八十至九十分钟。
      （2）上料次序：先装入木柴七斤，再装生铁一百斤，木炭八斤，将炉门闭起，拉风箱约十五至二十分钟，铁受热变红后，放开铁门，把料搅平，即可加第二次料。第二次料木柴五斤，生铁六十六斤，木炭六斤，关住炉门，继续冶炼。约十分钟后，炉门上口冒出白色火花，炉中心发白，周围透红，即可启开炉门，开始炒铁。
      （3）操作方法：把炉门启开，用大杠将料搅平，炉内生铁开始碎裂，碎到那里，就搅到那里。把烧红的小铁块，用杠拨到进风口处，铁就碎裂，随后再把四周没有碎裂的铁块拨到中间锻炼，这样反复翻搅，约十五分钟，大部分的铁变成抛松状态，把风口处的小钢块用小杠拨成团，每团重二点五至三斤，约两个拳头大，在风眼下四面吹风，直到钢团子发白，钳出锻打。如因操作不好，结成大块，应将大块送到进风口处，少吹片刻，然后对准风吹的地方，力捣两下，就会将大块捣碎，以免越结越大。钢块钳出锻打时，先要轻打，以防打散。钢块打成长方体，变紫红色后，再用力大打。钢块变黑后，再轻打几下。一般每块钢要打一百多锤。打成的钢块，四面平直，每块三斤左右。
    炼钢炉每炼一次钢，根据炉子情况，需耙渣、补炉。
      用热铁水炼钢（热装）
    如果炼钢炉附近有炼铁炉，能供应热铁水，可以直接用热铁水炼钢。
    每炉可用铁水二百斤左右。一般土炉每次出铁约一百多斤，可用两个炼铁炉配一个炼钢炉。
    直接用铁水炼钢时，炉内先放七至十斤木炭，然后注入铁水。铁水最好稠些。太稀（即太热）时，须冷一会儿再注入炉内，以防粘在炉壁上，损坏炉子。
    注入铁水后，拉风箱，开始搅。搅十五至二十分钟，就可以用小杠拨成钢团，然后一团一团取出锻打，方法与上述相同。一炉钢一小时就出完。
    直接用铁水炼钢的好处：①省劳力（碎铁、下料的劳力）；②省木炭、劈柴；③快（省掉烧热铁块的时间）；④出钢率比用生铁高（平均90％，最高93％）。
          生产工具
    搅铁用大铁杠两根（每根重约四十斤），小铁杠两根（每根重约二十五斤），打钢用铁锤五把（每把重四斤，一把备用），夹钢用铁钳三把（一把备用），柴钳一把，打钢用铁砧子两个（每个重约四、五十斤，用生铁铸成），渣耙一个，装料小耙一个，竹筛一个（筛分打钢时溅出的钢屑、铁皮用。大块钢屑可以回炉）。（附图片）
