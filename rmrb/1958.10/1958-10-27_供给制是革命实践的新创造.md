	Marx said: "Mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve." Before practice, no one can think of all the methods and steps to build a country completely. Therefore, there are many specific problems that our party has encountered and solved, or solved to some extent, which Marx and Lenin did not encounter at the time. I think the supply system, this principle of distribution transitioning from remuneration according to labor to distribution according to need, is also one of such problems. As early as 1917, in "State and Revolution," Lenin asserted: "Once equal labor and equal wages have been established, the question of moving from apparent equality to actual equality, that is, implementing the principle of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,' will inevitably arise before mankind. As for what stages mankind will go through, and what practical methods will be used to achieve this highest goal – this we do not know and cannot know." He also said: "Creating new labor discipline, creating new forms of social connection between people, creating new forms and methods of attracting people to work – this requires many years, even decades, of work." This fully demonstrates that the issue of transitioning from remuneration according to labor to a distribution system according to need was not yet on the agenda at that time. Therefore, the solution could not be arranged in advance by anyone, but needed to be proposed and resolved through years of practice in the course of the revolution.
	Our party, based on the principle of combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese reality, and based on the experience of implementing the wage system in China in recent years, the experience of implementing the supply system in revolutionary base areas before liberation, and especially based on the current booming production upsurge in our country and the unprecedented improvement of the people's awareness, advocating the implementation of the supply system or semi-supply system is very timely. The advantages of the supply system are roughly six: First, it prompts the vast number of workers to break away from tedious housework, walk out of the circle of firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and devote themselves to the technological revolution and the cultural revolution; Second, it guarantees people's necessary means of livelihood; Third, it solves the differences in life caused by equal income but different burdens; Fourth, it promotes people's love for the collective, overcomes individualism, no longer haggling over wages, and concentrates on production; Fifth, it strengthens the relationship between the Party and the masses; Sixth, it creates conditions for the transition from remuneration according to labor to distribution according to need.
	Such a supply system with great superiority is obviously a big step forward than the wage system. The latter is a remnant of bourgeois right, while the former is the bud of communism and the beginning of distribution according to need. This is something unprecedented in the world and a new development of the Marxist-Leninist principle of distribution.

    供给制是革命实践的新创造
    谭文熙
    马克思说：“人类始终只会提出自己所能够解决的任务”。在未实践以前，谁也不能把所有建设国家的方法和步骤想得完整无缺。因此，有不少具体问题，在马克思、列宁当时所未遇到的问题，我们党遇到了，而且解决了，或者在某种程度上解决了。我想供给制这个由按劳取酬过渡到各取所需的分配原则也是这样的问题之一。列宁早在1917年在“国家与革命”一书中就这样论断：“一待劳动平等和工资平等以后，在人类面前就必然立刻发生从表面上的平等进到实际平等，即实行各尽所能、各取所需这一原则问题。至于人类究竟会经过怎样的阶段，究竟用怎样的实际方法达到这个最高的目的——这是我们不知道而且也不能知道的。”他还说：“创立新的劳动纪律，创立人与人之间新的社会联系形式，创立吸引人们从事劳动的新形式和新方法——这是需要有多年的几十年的工作。”这就充分表明：由按劳取酬过渡到各取所需的分配制度这个问题，在当时还没有提到日程上来。因此解决的方法是事先没有人能够安排好的，而须要在革命的进程中经过多年的实践，才能提出并予以解决。
    我们党本着马列主义和中国实际相结合的原则，根据中国近几年来实行工资制的经验，根据解放前革命根据地实行供给制的经验，特别是根据我国当前蓬勃发展的生产高潮和人民群众觉悟的空前提高，提倡搞供给制或半供给制，这是非常适时的。供给制的优点大体上有六条，即：一、促使广大劳动者摆脱烦琐的家务，从柴米油盐的圈子里走出来，投入技术革命和文化革命；二、保证人们必需的生活资料；三、解决收入相等却因负担各异而引起的生活上的差别；四、促使人们热爱集体，克服个人主义，不再斤斤计较工资报酬，而安心生产；五、密切党和群众的关系；六、为由按劳取酬过渡到各取所需创造条件。
    这样一个富有极大优越性的供给制，显然比工资制大大前进了一步。后者是资本主义法权的残余，前者乃是共产主义的萌芽，是各取所需的开端。这是世界上前所未有的东西，是马列主义分配原则的新发展。
