Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: The head of the visiting Greek Political and Cultural Delegation, Mablous, told Xinhua reporters on the 17th that due to Cyprus' long-term occupation by Britain, Greeks easily understand and sympathize with the position taken by China on the Taiwan issue. He also said, "No country should directly or indirectly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."

The Greek Political and Cultural Delegation arrived in China on August 20th at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. The head of the delegation, Mablous, a member of the Greek Liberal Party, and the deputy head of the delegation, Duriass, a member of parliament, spoke to reporters on the 17th about their views on certain issues in the current international situation and their impressions of their visit to China. Mablous said, "Countries should respect each other, and no country should directly or indirectly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. If this principle is universally implemented, peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world is entirely possible."

Mablous said, "The United Nations has not been able to become a world organization to safeguard peace as it declared when it was first organized. One of the reasons for the failure of the United Nations is that it still does not have a representative of the People's China, and according to the rights granted to China by the United Nations Charter, it is still occupied by a representative who cannot represent China at all."

When talking about the relationship between Greece and China, Mablous said: "Before the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, we can first expand economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries to prepare conditions for further establishment of political relations."

Mablous also mentioned that their delegation included representatives with various political inclinations, but they were all "very interested" in visiting China and the great achievements they saw in China. He said: "This is because we see China as a major country that is realizing industrialization and believe that China is playing an increasingly important role in solving Asian and world problems and defending peace."

Deputy Head of the delegation, Duriass, also said when talking about the Taiwan issue: "Greeks understand and sympathize with China's views very much and are considering their own Cyprus issue in the same spirit." Duriass also advocated that Greece and China can move from expanding economic and cultural ties to establishing political relations.

He also said that he was "very excited" when he saw the achievements of China's construction.

    希腊政治文化代表团正副团长表示
    希腊人同情中国在台湾问题上的立场
    希望中希两国扩大经济和文化交流
    新华社18日讯　正在我国访问的希腊政治文化代表团团长马布洛斯17日对新华社记者说，由于塞浦路斯的长期被英国占领，希腊人很容易理解和同情中国在台湾问题上所采取的立场。他并且说：“任何一个国家都不应该直接或间接干涉别国的内政。”
    希腊政治文化代表团是应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请在上月20日到中国来访问的。代表团团长、希腊自由党国会议员马布洛斯和代表团副团长、国会议员杜里亚斯17日向记者谈到了他们对当前国际局势中某些问题的看法和访华观感。马布洛斯说：“各个国家之间应该互相尊重，任何一个国家都不应该直接或间接干涉别国内政。如果这个原则得到普遍执行，世界各国和平共处是完全可能的。”
    马布洛斯说：“联合国现在并没有能像它开始组织的时候所宣告的那样成为保障和平的世界性组织。联合国失败的原因之一就是它至今还没有人民中国的代表，根据联合国宪章所赋予中国的权利，现在还由一个根本不能代表中国的代表占据着。”
    在谈到希腊同中国的关系时，马布洛斯说：“在两国还没有建立外交关系之前，可以先扩大两国经济和文化的交流，为进一步建立政治关系准备条件。”
    马布洛斯还谈到他们的代表团包括抱有各种政治倾向的代表人物，但是他们对访问中国和在中国所看到的巨大成就都“很感兴趣”。他说：“这是因为我们看到中国是一个正在实现工业化的大国，并且相信中国在解决亚洲和世界问题以及保卫和平方面正起着越来越重要的作用。”
    副团长杜里亚斯在谈到台湾问题时也说：“希腊人很理解和同情中国的观点，并且正以同样的精神考虑自己的塞浦路斯问题。”杜里亚斯也主张希腊和中国可以从扩大经济和文化联系而进入建立政治关系。
    他并且说他看到中国建设的成就时“心情很激动”。
