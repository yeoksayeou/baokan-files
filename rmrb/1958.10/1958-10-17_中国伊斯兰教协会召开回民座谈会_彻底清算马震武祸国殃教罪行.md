(Dispatch from our newspaper in Yinchuan) The China Islamic Association convened a symposium of Hui people in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, from August 17 to September 6. At the meeting, the crimes of the extreme rightist Ma Zhenwu in the Islamic community against the Communist Party, the people, and socialism were thoroughly exposed and criticized using methods of presenting facts, reasoning, extensive airing of views, and big-character posters.

Present at the meeting were Da Pongsheng and Zhang Yuzhen, vice chairmen of the China Islamic Association, some members of the association, and 407 representatives of Hui people from the provinces (autonomous regions) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Yunnan, Jilin, Hebei, Xinjiang, and Ningxia.

According to the exposures of the representatives attending the meeting, Ma Zhenwu, taking advantage of his position as the leader of the "Zhehai Linye" sect of the Shagou Menhuan, had long engaged in counter-revolutionary and anti-people activities under the cloak of religion, relying on religious privileges and certain religious systems that were detrimental to socialism and the development of the Hui nationality.

Before liberation, he harmed the masses and committed all kinds of evil, with hands stained with blood.

According to the representatives at the meeting, Ma Zhenwu committed all kinds of evil deeds, with his hands stained with blood. Before liberation, in order to consolidate and expand his feudal privileges and feudal power, he colluded with Kuomintang reactionary rulers such as Zhu Shaoliang, Ma Hongkui, and Ma Jiyuan to kill many peasants and revolutionary cadres. In 1939, after the Hui people's uprising in the Haiyuan and Guyuan areas of Gansu was suppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, Ma Zhenwu sent his henchmen to arrest and kill many Hui peasants and leading figures who participated in the uprising. He also conspired with Yang Deliang, a reactionary warlord of the Kuomintang, to kill 11 members of the family of Ma Siyi, who was one of the leaders of the uprising at that time and is now the secretary of the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

According to the meeting, Ma Zhenwu used the tyrannical power of the "religious leader" to persecute those who resisted him, were dissatisfied with him, or did not listen to his arrangements. Many people had their eyes gouged out, their ears and tongues cut off, their hands and feet cut off, their Achilles tendons severed, and their foot bones broken. Hui people such as Ma Zhanchuan and Ma Huaizhong in Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture became disabled for life due to his persecution. Even more appalling is that some people were beaten to death with guns and axes, and then their bodies were chopped into minced meat, and some had their hearts taken out to be rendered into oil. His long-term worker, Wang Longtou, was subjected to the cruelty of having his abdomen cut open and his heart gouged out. Zhang Zhenguo from Guyuan County married a woman who had been abandoned by Ma Zhenwu. After Ma Zhenwu found out, he killed all five members of Zhang Zhenguo's family. Even his own son, Ma Liangde, was poisoned to death by him in 1949 after liberation because he was dissatisfied with his wrongdoing.

After liberation, he bought off counter-revolutionaries and organized four rebellions.

According to the meeting, Ma Zhenwu used his "religious leader" status to issue "oral instructions" (instructions from the religious leader to the followers) and organized counter-revolutionary rebellions on several occasions. Before liberation, he colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries in an attempt to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Northwest China. After the liberation of the Northwest, Ma Zhenwu firmly opposed the Party's various policies. He regarded the government as a target of deception, and relying on his "strength" and "masses," he conspired to organize rebellions,妄想 to become a local emperor and "sit on the throne for forty years." In 1950, at the beginning of the liberation of the Northwest, when the people's power had not yet been established for long, Ma Zhenwu colluded with counter-revolutionaries in the Pingliang area and planned the "May 8th" (May 8, 1950) counter-revolutionary armed rebellion. At that time, counter-revolutionaries, holding flags stamped with Ma Zhenwu's seal, incited and threatened a part of the masses who did not clearly understand our Party, and once besieged Pingliang City. In 1952, when land reform began in the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture area, Ma Zhenwu again planned the "April 2nd" (April 2, 1952) counter-revolutionary armed rebellion. During the rebellion, his henchmen distributed a large number of "Pirhan" (introduction letters to heaven) stamped with Ma Zhenwu's scripture seal, saying, "The gate to heaven is open, and ancestors are waiting to receive you." In April of this year, just as the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was being醞釀 established, Ma Zhenwu妄想 tried to篡夺 the leadership of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, so he sent his henchmen to Zhangjiachuan Hui Autonomous County, Gansu, to carry out串连 activities, using the excuse of "protecting the Gongbei" (the Gongbei is the tomb of the Hui religious leader) to create the "April 4th" (April 4th) counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, in which hundreds of counter-revolutionaries participated. He also put forward the "three-light" slogan of "kill all the cadres,搶光 the grain in the warehouses, and搶光 the property of the cooperatives and trading companies." However, after several years of work by the Party and the government, the Hui people's awareness has been greatly improved. Therefore, this rebellion was quickly and thoroughly quelled shortly after it occurred, with the active help and close cooperation of the Hui people. After the "April 4th" rebellion was quelled, Ma Zhenwu was still不死心, and instructed his henchmen Ma Dong and Zhen Rujin to launch a rebellion in Zhenjiacha, Tongxin County, on June 1. The evidence seized from the bandits who were killed by us clearly shows Ma Zhenwu's ambition. This evidence states that the purpose of the rebellion was to "establish a Hui Republic in the Ningxia area," the organizational form was "unified Party, government, religion, and army," the reactionary organization was named "Islamic Democratic Party," and the slogan was "avenge Ma Jiao (Ma Zhenwu) and win glory for Islam."

According to the meeting, Ma Zhenwu's means of using religion to threaten the masses to participate in counter-revolutionary activities were extremely vicious. The slogan he put forward was: "Those who do not participate in the rebellion will have their entire families wiped out." Xi Guihua, a woman from Xiji County, accused at the conference that during the "April 2nd" rebellion, bandits from Ma Zhenwu in Xiji灘 forced her father to participate in the rebellion. Her father refused, and the bandits cut off her father's leg and finally架 her father onto firewood and burned him to death.

In order to accumulate the strength for counter-revolutionary rebellion, Ma Zhenwu bought off a group of fugitive landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and covered them up in the name of religious professionals, placed them in Gongbei, Daotang, and mosques, and prepared to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Ma Zhenwu used the name of religious professionals to harbor and arrange for more than 30 counter-revolutionaries in the Wuzhong area alone. In the revelations and criticisms at the meeting, the participants unanimously believed that Ma Zhenwu's counter-revolutionary activities directly affected the development of the Hui nationality and became a stumbling block for the Hui people to take the socialist road.

Using religious privileges to cruelly exploit the Hui people.

Representatives from various places also used a large number of facts in their disclosures to show that Ma Zhenwu not only used the "oral instruction" system and his feudal power to harm the people and organize rebellions, but also used religion to cruelly exploit the Hui people. The main points revealed at the meeting were: Ma Zhenwu arranged a lot of "Amaili" (religious festivals for Ahong to chant sutras and eat meals to commemorate the ancestors), and took advantage of the dead to大肆 collect money from the masses. For example, the days of birth and death of relatives in his family were arranged at religious ceremonies. What "Grandma's" day, "Madam's" day, "Great Aunt's" day, etc. There are 65 "Amaili" a year, one every six or seven days on average, seven of which are large. On these festivals, Ma Zhenwu instructed his henchmen to force the masses to give him "Nie Tie." The Hui people in Xiji County alone were extorted more than one million yuan each year. After the "April 2nd" rebellion in 1952, the Party and the People's Government distributed 1.2 billion yuan (old currency) in relief funds to help the Hui people settle down and start their businesses. At that time, Ma Zhenwu诈骗 more than 600 million yuan (old currency) by means of Amaili and scattered Nie Tie. He also relied on religious privileges to stipulate many feudal exploitation systems. To this day, he owns more than 2,500 mu of land in Xiji alone. The operation of these lands depends on his slaves and the Hui people to provide him with unpaid labor. The Xiji灘 Agricultural Cooperative has to bear more than 2,600 man-days and more than 2,100 animal-days for him every year. When the harvest season arrives, the Hui people within a radius of eighty or ninety li are forced to abandon the crops of the community and come to serve Ma Zhenwu. His "slaves" are not paid wages, but he also requires the churches (a mosque and the area where the mosque's followers are located are called a church) to pay for a worker's fee every year. The firewood burned in his house is also supplied by the masses of the churches. The Ahong of the Islamic mosque are all appointed by Ma Zhenwu. He also extracted a large amount of money through the appointment of Ahong. Some Ahong, in order to please Ma Zhenwu, unscrupulously cheated the masses. He also often搜刮民财 in the name of repairing the "Gongbei." In 1954 alone, he诈骗 hundreds of thousands of yuan in the Chuanchang, Jilin. In order to achieve the purpose of exploiting the people, Ma Zhenwu did not hesitate to adopt all卑鄙 means. When someone dies or a widow remarries, they have to send him money, otherwise the dead cannot be buried and the widow cannot marry. Ma Zhenwu drove his nephew Ma Guobi to sell more than 100 widows successively, earning more than 5,000 yuan. Before and after liberation, Ma Zhenwu also sold hair, beards, grave soil, firewood ashes, dry bread crusts,碎布条, and even his own feces to the masses as "immortal medicine" to "cure diseases." Not only did he骗去 a lot of money, but he also害了不少人性命. Last year alone, he sold the dirty soil from the demolished Pingliang Gongbei to the社员 of Miaowan Village, Jingyuan County, and killed ten children. He also sold a large number of "Pirhan" to deceive and愚弄 the masses. Due to his serious exploitation, the general Hui people under his教每年 were required to pay 30%, or even 60%, of their annual production income as religious burdens, which he搜刮 away.

At the beginning of the meeting, Ma Zhenwu狡猾 denied the charges and refused to confess. Later, after more than ten days of exposure and criticism, he admitted that the four counter-revolutionary rebellions were planned by him and initially confessed to his armed rebellion and his crimes against the people in the face of a large number of facts. At the same time, he also confessed to the crimes of feudal exploitation by relying on the religious system.

Representatives from various places requested that severe action be taken.

In their speeches, representatives from various places pointed out that Ma Zhenwu was a political ambitious element in religious clothing before liberation. After liberation, the Party and the government hoped that he would痛改前非 and atone for his crimes. The Party adopted an attitude of unity, education, and help towards him. The People's Government also gave him appropriate care and placement, arranging for him to serve as a member of the Nationalities Affairs Committee of the former Northwest Military and Political Committee, the governor of the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the vice chairman of the China Islamic Association. In various democratic reform movements and socialist transformations, the Party and the government adopted a lenient policy towards him. However, Ma Zhenwu still insisted on his reactionary position and used religion to carry out activities to顛复 the people's power. Therefore, the representatives demanded that the government severely punish the extreme rightist Ma Zhenwu. In the in-depth exposure and criticism of Ma Zhenwu's crimes, many representatives also pointed out that lessons must be learned through this struggle, some old exploitative systems and other unreasonable systems in religion must be abolished, and bad people should not be allowed to rely on these systems to undermine socialist construction and hinder national development. He Fucheng, a representative from Jilin Province, demanded the abolition of Ma Zhenwu's "口唤" system, the "放 Ahong" system, and the abolition of Ma Zhenwu's personal and mosque land and livestock ownership; resolutely implement the policy of freedom of religious belief, and prohibit the use of religion to interfere with the people's actions and exploit the people's behavior.

Ma Yuhuai, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, made a speech at the end of the meeting. He said: "Ma Zhenwu is a feudal mountain壓 on the heads of the Hui people. He has long cruelly ruled and exploited the people, hindering the political, economic, and cultural development of the Hui people. The complete exposure of Ma Zhenwu's reactionary nature will further liberate the Hui people, especially the masses he enslaves, from the shackles of feudal remnants, and more actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. "Based on a large number of facts, Ma Yuhuai pointed out that Ma Zhenwu is a consistently阴谋 to overthrow the people's power, attempt to复辟 the reactionary class rule, and坚决 anti-Communist and anti-people extreme rightist. Ma Yuhuai, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, announced the revocation of all administrative duties held by Ma Zhenwu, such as member of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and governor of the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and suggested that relevant departments handle his property. Finally, he said: Although this struggle has achieved great victory, it is only the beginning of the struggle. In the future, we must make persistent efforts to carry out this struggle to the end. Da Pongsheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, announced at the meeting on behalf of the China Islamic Association that Ma Zhenwu would be relieved of his position as Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed with the China Islamic Association and the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to temporarily make the above handling of Ma Zhenwu, and said that after returning to their respective places, they would widely publicize the spirit of this meeting, mobilize the masses to continue to expose and criticize Ma Zhenwu's crimes, and determined to launch a struggle against other bad people and bad deeds in the religious community.

    中国伊斯兰教协会召开回民座谈会
    彻底清算马震武祸国殃教罪行
    本报银川电　中国伊斯兰教协会从8月17日至9月6日在宁夏银川市召开了回民座谈会，在会上用摆事实、讲道理、大鸣大放、大字报的方法彻底揭露和批判了伊斯兰教界中的极右分子马震武的反共反人民反社会主义的罪行。
    出席这次会议的有中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生、张玉珍和部分委员，还有陕西、甘肃、青海、云南、吉林、河北、新疆、宁夏等省（区）的回民代表四百零七人。
    据与会代表的揭发，马震武利用自己“哲海林耶”教派沙沟门宦教主的地位，长期披着宗教外衣，依靠宗教特权和某些不利于社会主义和回族民族发展的宗教制度，进行着反共反人民的罪恶活动。解放前残害群众，无恶不作，血债累累
    经出席会议的代表的揭露，马震武无恶不作，血债累累。他在解放前为了巩固与扩大他的封建特权和封建势力，曾和国民党反动统治者朱绍良、马鸿逵、马继援等勾结，杀害了很多农民和革命干部。在1939年，甘肃海原、固原地区的回民起义被国民党反动派镇压之后，马震武派他的爪牙逮捕和杀害了很多参加起义的回族农民和领导骨干。他并和国民党的反动军阀杨德亮合谋杀害了当时起义领导人之一，现任中共固原回族自治州委员会书记马思义的家属十一人。
    据会议揭露，马震武利用“教主”的淫威，经常对反抗他、不满意他和不听他摆布的人进行残害。有很多人被他挖掉了眼睛，割去了耳朵和舌头，割了手脚，挑断了脚筋，砸断了脚骨，像固原回族自治州的回民马占川、马怀忠就在他的迫害下终身成了残废。更令人发指的是还有一些人被他用手枪、斧头打死以后，还把尸体剁成肉酱，有的人被他掏心炼油。他的长工王龙头就遭到他剖腹剜心的残害。固原县张振国和被他遗弃的女人结婚，被他知道后，将张振国一家五口人全部杀死。就是他亲生的儿子马梁德因不满意他的胡作非为，在解放后，1949年也被他毒死了。解放后收买反革命分子，组织四次叛乱
    据会议揭露，马震武利用“教主”地位，放“口唤”（教主对教民的指示），历次组织反革命叛乱。他在解放前，就勾结国民党反动派妄图阻止中国人民解放军解放大西北。西北解放后，马震武坚决反对党的各项政策。视政府为可欺，自恃有“力量”“有群众”，阴谋组织叛乱，妄想当土皇帝，“坐四十年天下”。1950年正当西北解放初期，人民政权建立不久，马震武勾结平凉地区的反革命分子，策划了“五八”（1950年5月8日）反革命武装叛乱。当时反革命分子拿着盖有马震武印章的旗子，煽动威胁一部分对我党认识不清的群众，曾围攻平凉城。1952年在固原回族自治州地区开始土改时，马震武又策划了“四二”（1952年4月2日）反革命武装叛乱。叛乱中他手下的爪牙大量散发盖有马震武经文名章的“皮尔罕”（即进天堂的介绍信），说什么“进天堂的门开着，辈辈的太爷等着接哩。”今年4月间，正当酝酿成立宁夏回族自治区时，马震武又妄想篡夺宁夏回族自治区的领导权，于是就派出他的爪牙到甘肃张家川回族自治县进行串连活动，以“保护拱北”（拱北是回族宗教领袖的坟墓）为借口，制造了有几百反革命分子参加的“四四”（4月4日）反革命武装叛乱。并提出“见干部杀光，仓库粮食抢光，合作社、贸易公司财产抢光”的“三光”口号。但是，经过了党和政府几年来的工作，回族群众的觉悟大大提高了，因此在这个叛乱刚刚发生不久，就在回族人民的积极帮助和密切配合下，迅速彻底地平息了。“四四”叛乱平息后，马震武还不死心，又指使其爪牙马栋、镇如金于6月1日在同心县镇家岔发动叛乱。从被我击毙的匪徒身上搜出的罪证上可以更清楚的看出马震武的野心，在这罪证上写着叛乱的目的是“在宁夏地区成立回族共和国”，组织形式是“党、政、教、军统一”，反动组织名为“伊斯兰民主党”，口号是“为马教主（马震武）报仇，为伊斯兰教争光。”
    据会议揭发，马震武利用宗教威胁群众参加反革命活动的手段是极其毒辣的。他提出的口号是：“不参加叛乱的就要剿灭全家”。西吉县妇女郗桂花在大会上控诉说，在“四二”叛乱时，马震武在西吉滩的匪徒强迫她父亲参加叛乱，她父亲拒不参加，匪徒砍断了她父亲的腿，最后又把她父亲架到柴上烧死了。
    马震武为了积蓄反革命叛乱的力量，收买了一批逃亡地主、反革命分子和坏分子，并用宗教职业者的名义掩护起来，安插在拱北、道堂、清真寺内，准备进行反革命活动。马震武利用宗教职业者的名义，仅在吴忠地区包庇和安插的反革命分子就有三十多个。在会议上揭发和批判中，与会代表一致认为：马震武的反革命活动，直接影响了回民族的发展，成了回族人民走社会主义的绊脚石。利用宗教特权，残酷剥削回民群众
    各地代表在揭发中还用大量事实说明，马震武不仅利用“口唤”制度和他的封建势力残害人民、组织叛乱，而且还利用宗教对回民群众进行残酷的剥削。会上揭发出的主要的有：马震武安排了很多“阿买里”（为纪念先人，请阿訇念经、吃饭的宗教节日），借着死人大肆搜刮群众钱财。如把他家族中亲人生死的日子，安排在宗教仪式上。什么“奶奶”的日子，“太太”的日子，“姑太太”的日子等。一年要过六十五个“阿买里”，平均六、七天过一个，其中大的有七个。逢到这些节日，马震武就指示他的爪牙强迫群众给他散“乜贴”。每年仅西吉县回族人民就被他敲诈勒索去一百多万元。1952年“四二”叛乱后，党和人民政府为了帮助回族人民安家立业，发放了十二亿元（旧币）救济款。马震武当时就用过阿买里、散乜贴的手段诈骗去了六亿多元（旧币）。他还凭借宗教特权，规定许多封建剥削制度。他至今仅在西吉就拥有二千五百多亩土地，这些土地的经营，一方面靠他手下的奴隶，另方面靠回民群众给他作无偿的劳役，西吉滩农业社每年要给他负担二千六百多个人工和二千一百多畜工。到了收获季节，周围八、九十里路的回民群众都被迫抛开社的庄稼，来为马震武服劳役，他家的“奴隶”是没有工钱的，但他还要各坊（一个清真寺及该寺教徒所在地区称坊）教徒每年出一次雇工费。他家烧的柴也要各坊群众供给。伊斯兰教清真寺的阿訇全由马震武委派。通过委派阿訇也榨取了一大笔钱财。有些阿訇为了讨好马震武，就不顾一切地诈骗群众。他还经常以修“拱北”为名，大量搜刮民财。仅1954年在吉林船厂一次就被他诈骗了数十万元。马震武为达到剥削人民的目的，不惜采用一切卑鄙手段。死了人，寡妇改嫁，也要给他送钱，否则死人埋不了，寡妇嫁不了。马震武驱使他的侄子马国珌就先后卖过一百多个寡妇，得钱五千多元。马震武解放前后还把头发胡子、坟土、柴灰、干馍巴巴、碎布条，甚至自己的粪便都当作“仙丹灵药”卖给群众“治病”。不但骗去大量钱财，而且害了不少人的性命。仅去年，他把拆了平凉拱北的脏土卖给泾源县庙湾社社员后，就害死了十个小孩，他还卖出大量“皮尔罕”欺骗愚弄群众。由于他的严重剥削，他教下的一般回民群众，每年生产收入的30％，甚至60％都作为宗教负担，被他搜刮去了。
    会议开始时，马震武狡猾抵赖，拒不交代。以后，经过十多天的揭发批判，在大量事实面前才承认了四次反革命叛乱是他主谋策划的，初步交代了他武装叛乱及其对人民的罪行。同时，对依靠宗教制度进行封建剥削的罪行也作了交代。各地回民代表要求严加处理
    各地代表在发言中指出，马震武在解放前是个披着宗教外衣的政治野心分子，解放后，党和政府希望他痛改前非，立功赎罪。党对他采取了团结、教育和帮助的态度。人民政府也给了他适当的照顾和安置，安置他担任原西北军政委员会民族事务委员会委员、固原回族自治州州长、政协全国委员会委员、中国伊斯兰教协会副主任等职务。在各项民主改革运动和社会主义改造中，党和政府对他采取了宽大政策。但是马震武仍旧坚持他的反动立场，利用宗教进行颠复人民政权的活动，因此，代表们纷纷要求政府对极右分子马震武严加处理。不少代表在深入揭发和批判马震武的罪行中还指出，通过这次斗争必须接受教训，废除宗教中一些旧的剥削制度和其他一些不合理的制度，不使坏人依靠这些制度破坏社会主义建设，妨碍民族的发展。吉林省代表何富成提出要求废除马震武的“口唤”制度，“放阿訇”的制度，废除马震武个人和清真寺的土地、牲畜所有制；坚决贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，禁止利用宗教干涉群众行动和剥削群众的行为。
    宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会副主任马玉槐在会议最后作了发言。他说：“马震武是压在回民头上的一座封建大山，他长期残酷地统治、压榨人民，阻碍回族人民在政治、经济、文化上的发展。马震武反动本质的彻底暴露，将进一步把回族人民特别是他奴役下的群众从封建残余的束缚下解放出来，更加积极地参加祖国社会主义建设事业。马玉槐根据大量事实指出：马震武是个一贯阴谋推翻人民政权、企图复辟反动阶级统治、坚决反共反人民的极右分子。马玉槐代表宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会宣布撤销马震武担任的宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会委员和固原回族自治州州长等一切行政职务，并建议有关部门处理他的财产。最后他说：这一斗争虽然取得很大胜利，但只是斗争的开始，今后必须再接再厉，把这一斗争坚持到底。中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生代表中国伊斯兰教协会在会上宣布，停止马震武担任的中国伊斯兰教协会副主任的职务。与会代表一致同意中国伊斯兰教协会和宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会对马震武暂作以上的处理，表示回到各地后，广泛宣传这次会议的精神，发动群众继续揭露和批判马震武的罪行，并决心向宗教界中的其它坏人坏事展开斗争。（附图片）
