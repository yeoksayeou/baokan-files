    Longxi Special District Launches Mass Campaign to Study Theory: Lecture Halls Everywhere in Fields and by Furnaces; Workers and Peasants Learn to Use Philosophy to Guide Production

    (Our dispatch) This reporter Lei Pu reports: In Fujian Province, the broad masses of workers and peasants in the Longxi Special District are using philosophy to guide production, thereby promoting it.

    After the Longxi Special District in Fujian Province implemented the principle of theoretical work facing the workers and peasants and orienting towards practice, a new atmosphere of the whole population studying, publicizing, and applying theory has emerged. At present, 750,000 workers and peasants in this special district are studying Comrade Mao Zedong's famous work, "On Contradiction." In the mass learning upsurge, 150 township-level Party schools, 209 branch schools, and a large number of red-and-expert schools and spare-time schools have been established in the district's eleven counties and cities. A Marxist-Leninist lecturing corps composed of worker-peasant cadres, totaling more than 37,000 people, has emerged.

    In mid-August of this year, the Yunxiao County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the Party schools in Pumei and Chuanchang of the Red Flag People's Commune, ran a nine-day training class for party members who did not leave production. Under the guidance of dialectical materialism, taking practice as the key link, they used methods such as big blooming and contending, big-character posters, and great debates to vigorously break down the right-leaning conservative thoughts such as "conditionism" and "skepticism" of some party members in the face of the new situation. The ideological understanding of party members has generally been improved. Then, mass blooming and debate were carried out to find the main contradictions existing in local production. In the Dongkeng Brigade of the Chuanchang cultivation area, a piece of rice turned yellow due to insufficient fertilization. The masses said: "If the rice is all named Yellow, how can we harvest ten thousand catties of grain?" Everyone analyzed the internal reasons for the yellowing of the rice and then studied the conditions for making the rice "named Green" (turning green). After discussion, the main contradiction was found. It turned out that some people were waiting for commercial fertilizer and lacked the energy to accumulate fertilizer. Once the contradiction was revealed, the masses launched a fertilizer accumulation and topdressing movement. After a few days, the rice turned green. The masses happily said: "The theory of contradiction is really useful, rice named Yellow can turn named Green."

    After the Longxi Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-the-spot conference on theoretical work in the Red Flag People's Commune, the whole region launched a mass movement to study and apply philosophy with practice as the key link. The fields and the furnace sides were all lecture halls; production and life were applying philosophy in everything. The Longxi Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party summed up the experience of the mass philosophy study as follows: First, the whole party takes action, and the secretary takes command, which is the fundamental guarantee for the rapid development of the movement. The heads and team leaders of the lecturing corps in each county, township, and commune are all personally appointed by the party committee secretaries, and many secretaries and committee members spare time from their busy schedules to give lectures or take on some fixed courses. All county party committees put theoretical work on the important agenda of the party committee for discussion. Second, learning philosophy is combined with production, guiding production, and promoting production. At present, all localities are vigorously engaged in steelmaking and stepping up the management of autumn fields. In some counties, 70% of the labor force has gone to the mountains and factories. The lecturing corps in various places have also moved their lectures to the mountains and factories, using Marxism-Leninism to guide steel production. Yuxi Township organized more than 200 women to wash iron sand, but because of the low technical level, the output was not high, which affected the supply of raw materials. The lecturers gave them lectures on the theory of contradiction, with the theme that iron sand cannot meet the needs of iron smelting, so that everyone can find the main contradiction of less iron extraction, which is the contradiction between backward iron sand washing technology and the need for raw materials. They then proposed a way to solve the contradiction: use their brains, find tricks, and improve technology. After several days of research, the efficiency of women washing iron sand generally increased by one to two times. Third, learn what to do, and where there is a contradiction, theory goes there to help solve it. Longqing Agricultural Cooperative in Pinghe County is a rich cooperative, and Shangge Cooperative is a poor cooperative. Recently, the two cooperatives are to be merged into one commune. A few rich members of Longqing Cooperative are afraid of suffering losses. They say: Pork with pickled vegetables, the fat is being wiped out! The lecturers organized cooperative members to conduct debates on the relationship between the collective and the individual, and the relationship between the whole and the part, criticized erroneous ideas, and solved the problem of running the commune.

    After learning philosophy, street residents in Taiyuan broke superstition and no longer believed in ghosts and gods. This is the study group of Tiejiang Lane and Mianhuagang in the South City District of Taiyuan City holding a discussion meeting.

### 龙溪专区全民学理论　田间炉旁处处是讲堂  工农群众学会用哲学指导生产

    龙溪专区全民学理论　田间炉旁处处是讲堂
    工农群众学会用哲学指导生产
    本报讯　记者雷普报道：福建省龙溪专区广大工农群众用哲学指导生产，推动生产。
    福建省龙溪专区贯彻理论工作面对工农群众、面向实际的方针以后，出现了全民学习理论、宣传理论、应用理论的新风气。目前，这个专区有七十五万工人、农民正在学习毛泽东同志的名著——“矛盾论”。在群众性的学习热潮中，全区十一个县市已成立了一百五十所乡级党校、二百零九所分校和大量的红专学校、业余学校，涌现出一支由工农干部组成的总数达三万七千多人的马克思列宁主义讲师团。
    今年8月中旬，中共云霄县委以红旗人民公社莆美、船场等地党校为基础，开办了九天不脱离生产的党员训练班，在辩证唯物主义指导下，以实践为纲，用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论等学习方法大破部分党员在新形势面前产生的“条件论”、“怀疑论”等右倾保守思想。使党员的思想认识普遍得到提高。接着在群众中开展鸣放辩论，找寻当地生产上存在的主要矛盾。船场耕作区东坑大队有一片水稻，因为施肥不足而开始发黄。群众说：“稻子都姓黄，怎收万斤粮？”大家就分析稻子发黄的内部原因，再研究使稻子“姓青”（转青）的条件。经过辩论，主要矛盾找出来了，原来有部分人等待商品肥料，积肥劲头不足。矛盾一经揭开，群众便掀起一个积肥追肥运动，几天之后稻子转青了。群众高兴地说：“矛盾论真有用，稻子姓黄能转姓青。”
    中共龙溪地委在红旗人民公社召开全区理论工作现场会议后，全区就开展了以实践为纲的全民学哲学用哲学运动。田间、炉旁到处都是讲堂；生产、生活事事都应用哲学。中共龙溪地委总结全民学哲学的经验是：第一，全党动手，书记挂帅，这是运动开展迅速的根本保证。各县、乡、社讲师团团长、组长都由党委书记亲自担任，许多书记、委员在百忙中抽出时间去讲课或担任部分固定课程，各县委都把理论工作放在党委重要议事日程上进行讨论。第二，学哲学和生产结合，指导生产，推动生产。目前各地正在大搞钢铁，加紧秋田管理，有的县70％的劳力已上山进厂，各地讲师团也把讲座搬到山上和工厂，用马克思列宁主义指导钢铁生产。玉溪乡组织了二百多个妇女洗铁砂，因为技术不高，产量不多，影响了原料供应。讲师们就以铁砂不能满足炼铁需要为题向她们讲授矛盾论，让大家找到出铁少的主要矛盾，是洗铁砂技术落后和原料需要发生矛盾。她们便提出解决矛盾的办法是动脑筋，找窍门，改进技术。经过几天钻研，妇女们洗铁砂的效率普遍提高一倍到两倍。第三，干什么，学什么，哪里有矛盾，理论就到哪里帮助解决。平和县隆庆农业社是个富裕社，山格社是个穷社，最近两个社要合并成一个公社，隆庆社少数富裕社员怕吃亏，他们说：猪肉配咸菜，肥的被揩油啦！讲师们就以集体和个人的关系，整体和局部的关系为题，组织社员进行辩论，批判错误思想，解决了办公社问题。（附图片）
    太原市街道居民学习哲学以后，破除迷信，再也不相信鬼神。这是太原市南城区铁匠巷、棉花港的学习小组在开讨论会。
