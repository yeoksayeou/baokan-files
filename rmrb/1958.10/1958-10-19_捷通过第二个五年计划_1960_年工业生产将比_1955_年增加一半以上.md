Czechoslovakia’s Second Five-Year Plan Law for the Development of the National Economy (1956-1960) stipulates that by 1960, industrial production will increase by 54.4% and agricultural production will increase by 27% compared to 1955. This law was unanimously approved at the autumn session of the National Assembly held in Prague on the morning of the 16th.

According to this law, state capital construction funds will increase by 41% compared to the first five-year plan period. Fuel production will increase by 47% by the end of 1960 compared to 1955, and lignite production will increase by 57%. Pig iron production will increase by almost 59%, and steel production will increase by more than 51%. This increase will place Czechoslovakia among the world leaders in basic steel material production per capita.

Mechanical production will increase by 77% during the second five-year plan, and the chemical industry will increase by 61%. Significant emphasis will be placed on expanding the power base, with electricity generation increasing by 61% compared to 1955, reaching a total electricity generation of 24.2 billion kilowatt-hours.

The development of the national economy creates realistic conditions for a significant improvement in people's living standards. Individual consumption will increase by at least one-third.

Chairman Šimůnek of the State Planning Commission, in his explanation of the second five-year plan, reviewed the development of Czechoslovakia’s national economy over the past two years.

Šimůnek emphasized that all ministries had exceeded their production plans for the first nine months of this year. Therefore, it can be said that this year is a milestone in fulfilling the goals of the second five-year plan. The tasks set for the next two years can be accomplished, and even overfulfilled.

The National Assembly will also discuss and approve other government bills at this session.

    捷通过第二个五年计划
    1960年工业生产将比1955年增加一半以上
    捷克斯洛伐克第二个发展国民经济的五年计划法案（1956—1960）规定，到1960年时，工业生产将比1955年增加54.4％，农业生产将增加27％。这个法案已在16日上午在布拉格召开的国民议会秋季会议上一致通过。
    按照这个法案，国家基本建设资金将比第一个五年计划期间增加41％。燃料生产到1960年底将比1955年增加47％，褐煤生产将增加57％。生铁生产将增加差不多59％，钢的生产将增加51％以上。这样增加以后，将使捷克斯洛伐克在按人口平均计算的基本钢铁材料生产方面居于世界前列。
    机械生产在第二个五年计划期间将增加77％，化学工业将增加61％。很大的重点将放在扩展动力基础方面，发电量将比1955年增加61％，总发电量将达到二百四十二亿瓩时。
    国民经济的发展为人民生活水平的大大提高创造了现实条件。个人消费将至少增加三分之一。
    国家计划委员会主席西穆涅克在他对第二个五年计划进行说明时，回顾了过去两年捷克斯洛伐克国民经济发展的情况。
    西穆涅克着重指出，今年各部都超额完成了头九个月的生产计划。因此可以说，在履行第二个五年计划的目标方面，今年是一个里程碑。在今后两年中所规定的任务是可以完成，并且超额完成的。
    国民议会这次会议还将讨论通过其他的政府法案。
