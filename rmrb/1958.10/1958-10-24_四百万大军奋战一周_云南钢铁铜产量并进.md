Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 23rd: Yunnan Province's four million-strong steel and copper army has achieved significant results after a week of hard work. From the 15th to the 21st, the province produced a total of 8,295 tons of steel, 66,034 tons of iron, and 604.9 tons of copper. The copper production is equivalent to 70.1% of the total production from January to September. Except for some substandard native steel and the poor quality of iron produced in some iron smelting kilns, the quality of steel, iron, and copper is generally good.

During this week, a large-scale mass movement for steelmaking, iron smelting, and copper smelting quickly formed throughout the province, with nearly four million people participating each day. More than 140,000 furnaces of various types for steelmaking, iron smelting, and copper smelting were built in a week. Cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants throughout the province overcame difficulties such as continuous heavy rain and inconvenient transportation. They not only overfulfilled the steel production tasks, but also received great training politically, organizationally, and ideologically. They also initially mastered the techniques of steelmaking, iron smelting, and copper smelting, and understood that steelmaking, iron smelting, and copper smelting are not mysterious, but they are not simple either. Cadres at all levels further promoted the fine tradition of eating, living, and working with the masses, and further enriched their experience in leading large-scale mass movements. This has laid the foundation for achieving greater victories on the steel and copper front.

Currently, the masses on the steel and copper front throughout the province are in high spirits. They are summarizing the experience of this week's high-yield movement, fiercely attacking technical barriers, continuing to focus on building furnaces and preparing materials, further strengthening political and ideological work, and persisting in continuous combat, striving to complete the annual state plan ahead of schedule. The province is also appropriately adjusting its teams, and under the leadership of steel as the key link, it is simultaneously focusing on rushing to harvest, rush to cultivate, and rush to plant, persisting in fighting on two fronts, and striving for a double harvest on the steel and agricultural fronts.

    四百万大军奋战一周
    云南钢铁铜产量并进
    新华社昆明23日电　云南省四百万钢铁铜大军经过一周奋战，取得了重大战果。从15日到21日，全省共产钢八千二百九十五吨，产铁六万六千零三十四吨，产铜六百零四点九吨。铜的产量相当于1月到9月总产量的70.1％。除部分次等土钢和炼铁窑生产的铁质量较差外，钢铁铜质量一般良好。
    在这一周，全省迅速形成了大规模的炼钢、炼铁、炼铜群众运动，每天上阵人数近四百万，一周内共建立起各种类型的炼钢、炼铁、炼铜的炉子十四万多座。各级干部和全省工农兵学商广大群众战胜了连日大雨、交通不便等等困难，不仅超额完成了钢铁生产任务，在政治上、组织上、思想上也受到了极大的锻炼。他们还初步掌握了炼钢、炼铁、炼铜的技术，懂得了炼钢、炼铁、炼铜并不神秘，但也不简单。各级干部进一步发扬了和群众同吃同住同劳动的优良作风，更加丰富了领导大规模群众运动的经验。这就为在钢铁铜战线上取得更大胜利打下了基础。
    现在，全省钢铁铜战线上群众斗志昂扬，正在总结这一周高产运动经验的基础上猛攻技术关，继续抓紧建炉备料，进一步加强政治思想工作，坚持持续战斗，力争提前完成全年国家计划。全省并适当地调整队伍，在以钢为纲的带动下，同时抓紧抢收抢耕抢种，坚持两面作战，夺取钢铁战线和农业战线上的双丰收。
