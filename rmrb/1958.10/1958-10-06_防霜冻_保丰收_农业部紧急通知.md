    Prevent Frost Damage and Ensure a Bumper Harvest
    Urgent Notice from the Ministry of Agriculture
    (Our Dispatch) The Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice on October 4 regarding strengthening frost prevention work. The notice said: Early frost has already appeared in the Northeast, Northwest, and Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hebei provinces in late September. According to meteorological forecasts, the Huanghuai River basin may experience early frost in mid-to-late October, generally about ten days earlier than usual. Currently, cotton and some late-maturing sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and other coarse grains in these areas have not yet fully matured. To ensure a bumper harvest, all localities must seize the time to prevent frost damage.
    The notice said: Smoke is an effective method for preventing frost. This method can be combined with the movement to accumulate and create fertilizer in the fields. Using the straw and fallen leaves of autumn crops, universally set up earth mounds for smoke fertilizer along the edges of late-maturing crop fields, conduct smoke fertilization on time. This can both prevent frost and create fertilizer, as well as save manpower and firewood.
    For mature crops, organize the masses to rush the harvest day and night before the frost comes to prevent freezing. For late rice, cotton, peanuts, sweet potatoes, buckwheat and other crops that have not yet fully matured, in addition to smoke, methods such as spraying water, sprinkling water, covering, pressing soil, or coiling vines can be taken according to the situation for protection. For late rice and cotton, measures such as draining and sunning the fields, and deep plowing in cotton fields can be taken at the same time to promote early maturity and avoid freezing.
    The notice pointed out: Frost prevention is a rigorous organizational task. It is difficult to achieve results if the organization is not good. Therefore, all people's communes must designate dedicated personnel to be responsible for unified command and deployment, and unified action, to fight the final battle of the autumn harvest well.

    防霜冻  保丰收
    农业部紧急通知
    本报讯　农业部于10月4日发出关于加强防霜工作的紧急通知。通知说：9月下旬东北、西北和山西、陕西、河北等地已经出现初霜。据气象部门预测，黄淮流域10月中、下旬可能先后出现初霜，一般将比常年提早十天左右。目前这些地区的棉花和一部分晚熟的甘薯、荞麦等杂粮作物还没有充分成熟，为确保丰产丰收，各地必须抓紧预防霜害的工作。
    通知中说：熏烟是防霜的有效办法。这种办法可以和田头积肥造肥运动结合起来，利用秋收作物的秸秆落叶，普遍在晚熟作物的田边设立熏肥的土堆，按时进行熏肥，既可防霜又能造肥，并且节省人力、柴草。
    已成熟的作物，在霜冻来临前，要组织群众星夜抢收，防止受冻。晚稻、棉花、花生、甘藷、荞麦等尚未充分成熟的作物，除熏烟外亦可分别情况采取喷雾器喷水、洒水、或复盖、压土、盘蔓等方法进行防护。对晚稻和棉花，同时可以采取排水晒地，棉田深中耕等办法，促使早熟，避免受冻。
    通知指出：防霜是一件严密的组织工作，组织不好很难收效，因此各人民公社要指定专人负责，统一指挥部署，统一行动，打好秋收的最后一仗。
