Xiamen Letter:

    Xiamen University's Salute
    Chen Kekun
    We, the faculty, staff, and students of Xiamen University, extend our greetings to the people of the entire nation from the front lines of coastal defense!
    Since the news of the Jinmen Chiang Kai-shek troops, supported by U.S. imperialism, shelling Xiamen University spread throughout the country and the world, millions of warm and enthusiastic letters and telegrams of sympathy have poured into our school like a tidal wave. To date, we have received over a hundred telegrams of sympathy and more than ten thousand letters of sympathy. Who can count the number of people represented by these millions of letters and telegrams? Who can count the power and potential contained in these millions of letters and telegrams?
    Anyone who looks at these letters and telegrams, even just glancing at the addresses of the senders and the content of two or three, will be unable to suppress their inner excitement. Because through them, one feels that hundreds of millions of beating hearts are with us, feels the power of the people and the warmth of comrades, and receives an extremely vivid and profound education in patriotism and internationalism. Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, as well as overseas compatriots, alumni, and correspondence students, have also sent letters and telegrams. The Communist Youth League Committee of Leningrad University made a passionate long-distance phone call. The团委 (Communist Youth League Committee) of the Mongolian National Choibalsan University sent a letter supporting our struggle against the enemy. Whether it's domestically or in Moscow, Kiev, Prague, Ulaanbaatar, Yangon, Jakarta... how many people are directly concerned about our struggle!
    The Zhongshan University students working on the Guangdong Tractor Factory construction site, upon hearing the broadcast, immediately picked up their baskets and tools and held a demonstration parade at the construction site. The iron-mining team from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel on their way to Guangzhou, immediately wrote letters on the train, with clear Beijing-Guangzhou train postmarks on the envelopes.
    How should we treat these millions of letters and telegrams? It is easy to send the letters to each company and platoon, and it is also necessary to send some letters to exhibitions so that more people can share this happiness. But what is the most practical action? This question has become a common consideration for the vast number of comrades.
    Now the sound of righteous artillery is ringing again. We are focusing on the front of the sea, ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time. To thank the Party and Chairman Mao, and to thank the support of hundreds of millions of people, we swear: We will work diligently and bravely to achieve new leaps forward on all fronts—the struggle against the enemy, military training, the educational revolution, the national steel-making campaign, running factories and farms, and scientific research—and use new victories to strike the enemy and report to you!

    厦门大学的敬礼
    陈可焜
    我们厦门大学的全体师生员工，在海防前线向全国人民致意！
    自从美帝国主义支持下的金门蒋军炮轰厦门大学的消息传遍全国和全世界之后，千万封热情洋溢的慰问函电，像海潮一样，源源不绝地涌进我们的学校。到现在，我们已收到一百多封慰问电和一万封以上的慰问信，谁能够数得清千万封函电所代表的人数？谁又能够数得清千万封函电所代表的所蕴藏的力量？
    谁只要看一看这些函电，哪怕看看它的寄信人地址和二三封内容，就会抑制不住内心的激动。因为通过它使人感到了亿万颗跳动的心和我们在一起，感到了人民的力量和同志的温暖，受到了极其生动而又深刻的爱国主义和国际主义的教育。远在苏联和捷克斯洛伐克留学的中国学生和海外的侨胞、校友和函授生，也寄了函电来。列宁格勒大学的共青团委员会打来了热情的长途电话。蒙古国立乔巴山大学团委员会寄来了支持我们对敌斗争的信。不论国内，不论莫斯科、基辅、布拉格、乌兰巴托、仰光、雅加达……，有多少人在直接关注着我们的斗争！
    在广东拖拉机厂工地上劳动的中山大学同学，一听到广播，即挑着畚箕，拿着工具在工地上示威游行。正在火车上的北京钢铁学院到广州的采铁大队，立刻在火车上写信，信封上有清晰的京广火车的邮戳。
    应该怎样对待这千万封函电呢？把信发到各连各排去是容易的，把一些函电送到展览会让更多人分享这个幸福，也是必要的。但是最实际的行动，又是什么呢？这个问题，已成为广大同志时常考虑的问题了。
    现在正义的炮声又响起了，我们正注视着大海的前方，随时准备着听候祖国的召唤。为了感谢党和毛主席，为了感谢亿万人民的支持，我们宣誓：一定英勇顽强地努力，在各个战线——对敌斗争，军事训练、教育革命，全民炼钢，办厂办农场，科学研究——上取得新的跃进，用新的胜利打击敌人，来向你们汇报！
