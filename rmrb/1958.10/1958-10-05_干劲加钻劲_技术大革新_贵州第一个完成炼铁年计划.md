Drive Plus Diligence, Technical Revolution
Guizhou First to Complete Annual Iron Smelting Plan
Complete 100,000 Tons, Then Re-smelt 100,000 Tons

(Our newspaper, Guiyang, 4th dispatch) In September, Guizhou Province produced 40,192 tons of pig iron, creating the highest monthly pig iron production record in Guizhou's history. Combined with the pig iron production from January to August, the province produced a total of 100,002,546 tons of pig iron, completing the year's state plan three months ahead of schedule and exceeding it by 2,546 tons. The people of all ethnic groups in the province have now decided to produce another 100,000 tons of pig iron for the country in the final three months.

At the beginning of this year, Guizhou Province had only over 100 small iron factories, and pig iron production was very low. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, where the steel industry was very backward, decided to vigorously develop the iron and steel industry. Starting in July, a campaign to build 10,000 indigenous blast furnaces was launched throughout the province. By September, more than 20,000 indigenous blast furnaces had been rapidly built, with more than 9,000 put into production.

After a large number of indigenous blast furnaces were put into production, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou launched a movement for a large-scale bumper harvest of pig iron production. In order to launch satellites in pig iron production to welcome the National Day, all regions immediately organized another labor army of more than 2 million people to join this battle on the basis of the original 700,000-plus iron smelting force. Due to the fact that one million laborers were active on the iron smelting front in the Zunyi Special District, pig iron production rapidly advanced to a new high. On the last day of September, the district produced 2,089 tons of pig iron, and five counties, including Zunyi, Renhuai, and Suiyang, produced more than 200 tons per day. The Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, which produced less than 800 tons of pig iron throughout the year last year, also produced 2,467 tons of pig iron in September under the day and night hard work of the whole Party and the entire people.

Drive plus diligence, greatly breaking through technical barriers, is a new characteristic of this iron smelting upsurge. In order to make the molten iron flow more and better, the people of all ethnic groups have widely carried out technical innovation activities. In smelting operations, many regions have promoted advanced experiences such as "graded and layered material distribution" and "timed charging and timed tapping." In terms of air blowing, manual bellows have been changed to hydraulic air blowing and foot-operated air blowing, which not only saves a lot of labor, but also makes the wind strong and even. Recently, various regions have also been changing from blowing cold air to sending hot air. According to a survey of nine indigenous blast furnaces that have been improved in Huishui County, the general output has been increased by more than one time, and accidents such as freezing in the furnace have been reduced.

In this large-scale iron smelting movement, Party committees at all levels personally went to the front line to direct the battle. They ate, lived, and labored with the workers, and promptly helped solve various problems in production. The county Party committees of the Bijie Special District ran experimental furnaces and personally conducted experiments, quickly breaking through the technical barriers of anthracite iron smelting, enabling the iron smelting movement in the entire district to develop normally.

### 干劲加钻劲  技术大革新  贵州第一个完成炼铁年计划

    干劲加钻劲  技术大革新
    贵州第一个完成炼铁年计划
    完成十万吨再炼十万吨
    本报贵阳4日电　贵州省在9月份中，生产生铁四万零一百九十二吨，创造了贵州省有史以来月产生铁的最高纪录，加上1到8月的生铁生产数量，全省共生产了生铁十万零二千五百四十六吨，已提前三个月和超额二千五百四十六吨完成今年国家计划。全省各族人民现在决定在最后三个月中，再为国家生产十万吨生铁。
    今年初，贵州省只有小型铁厂一百多个，生铁产量很少。自党中央提出工农业同时并举的方针后，钢铁生产十分落后的贵州省各族人民，决定大办钢铁工业。从7月起，全省各地展开了一个建设一万座土高炉的运动；到9月，就迅速建立起二万多座土高炉，并有九千多座投入生产。
    在土高炉大批投入生产后，贵州各族人民又掀起了一个生铁生产大面积丰收的运动。各地为了在生铁生产上放出卫星来迎接国庆，立即在原有七十多万炼铁队伍的基础上，又组织了二百多万劳动大军投入了这一战斗。遵义专区由于有一百万劳动大军活跃在炼铁战线上，使生铁生产迅速推向新的高潮。在9月最后一天，全区就生产了生铁二千零八十九吨，并出现了遵义、仁怀和绥阳等五个日产二百吨以上的县份。去年全年生产生铁不到八百吨的黔东南苗族侗族自治州，在全党全民日夜苦战下，9月份也生产生铁二千四百六十七吨。
    干劲加钻劲，大破技术关，是这个炼铁高潮中的新特点。各族人民为了铁水流得更多更好，都广泛开展了技术革新运动。在冶炼操作上，许多地区都推行了“分级、分层布料”和“定时上料定时出铁”等先进经验。在鼓风上，把人拉风箱改为水力鼓风和脚踏鼓风，这样不仅节约大量的劳动力，而且使风力又足又匀。最近，各地又在把鼓冷风改为送热风。据惠水县已改良的九座土高炉的调查，一般产量都提高一倍以上，并减少了炉内冻结等事故。
    在这个规模巨大的炼铁运动中，各级党委都亲临前线指挥战斗。他们同工人们同吃、同住、同劳动，及时帮助解决生产中的各种问题。毕节专区各县县委办试验炉，亲自搞试验，很快就突破了无烟煤炼铁的技术关，使全区的炼铁运动得到正常发展。
