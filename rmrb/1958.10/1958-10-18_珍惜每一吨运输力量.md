Cherish Every Ton of Transport Capacity
Editor's Note: Various localities are making every effort to tap transportation potential and alleviate transportation tensions, and have achieved great results. However, according to readers' letters, some places are still wasting transportation capacity due to shortcomings in the internal work of transportation departments, or due to shortcomings in the work of consigning and receiving units. The following five readers' letters raise this issue from different aspects, hoping to attract the attention of transportation and materials departments.

	Wide Margin, False Purpose
	At a time when railway transport capacity cannot fully meet transport needs, in order to ensure the ascent of the steel marshal and the completion of key transport tasks, railway departments have adopted a method of prioritizing based on urgency. However, we have also found that some units still have departmentalism, failing to consider the overall situation, and the phenomena of wide margins, false reporting of purpose, and falsely claiming non-urgent as urgent are very serious in their proposed plans. For example, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant and the Shenyang Tiexi Chemical Plant over-reported more than 7,000 tons of goods in October; some units even described firewood for burning as urgently needed materials for steelmaking, demanding that the railway department immediately provide cars. A county in Liaoning Province requested railway cars to transport stones, claiming they were for rescuing a breached reservoir, but after the railway department dispatched cars, it was discovered that they were for building pigsties. There are many similar examples. Due to the wide margins and false reporting of purpose by various consigning departments, it is difficult for the railway department to distinguish the urgency of the goods, and it even leads to a situation where urgently needed goods cannot be shipped out, while non-urgent goods are transported instead.
	It is hoped that all cargo transport units will proceed from the overall situation and make realistic transportation plans based on actual conditions. If they really cannot be prioritized, they should automatically give way to the steel marshal.

	"The Car Arrived at the Wrong Time"?
	The staff of our Beijing Long-Distance Bus Company are making every effort to tap potential and ensure that goods are delivered to receiving units as quickly as possible, but we also encounter some difficulties in our work. That is, some shipping units and receiving units cannot cooperate and coordinate well, which prolongs the loading and unloading time and causes vehicle congestion.
	Recently, we transported general merchandise to the Pinggu County Commercial Bureau in Hebei Province. After delivering the goods that night, no one unloaded them. The driver repeatedly asked the commercial bureau to unload the goods, but they refused to unload them and instead complained that the car arrived at the wrong time. Finally, with the help of the local transportation department, they unloaded the goods, but it was already several hours late. For example, a few days ago, we transported goods from other places to the Xisi Dabai Factory, and no one unloaded the goods after the car arrived. The driver asked the factory to find someone to unload the goods, but the factory not only did not find anyone, but also shirked responsibility. After repeated negotiations, it was delayed for several hours.
	In order to fully utilize transportation potential and avoid vehicle congestion, it is hoped that shipping and receiving units will cooperate with transportation departments, load and unload quickly, and enable vehicles to exert their due efficiency.

	One Car Transports Three Oxygen Cylinders
	Because some cargo transport units only want to transport things quickly, they charter a car regardless of the quantity of goods. Some transportation units find it too troublesome to consolidate shipments and do not consider the full utilization of transportation capacity, resulting in a serious waste of transport capacity. For example, Sanmen County in Zhejiang Province chartered a car to transport three oxygen cylinders, and counties such as Shouchang and Yuyao used a large truck with a load capacity of 3,500 kilograms to transport a blower weighing more than 700 kilograms. Whether from the perspective of transport capacity or freight, this is obviously a serious waste.
	It is recommended that transportation departments in various localities make reasonable arrangements for transporting materials so that transportation capacity can be fully utilized.

	Unstable Packaging Delays Time
	Recently, the Changjiang Shipping Bureau received a batch of butyric acid bacterial fertilizer (produced by Wuxi Zhenyuan Chemical Factory). When it arrived in Yichang, all the packaging paper bags had rotted, making it impossible to unload. It was necessary to send 103 workers to re-bag and sort them, resulting in a loss of 3,200 ton-days of transport capacity. Similar things happen frequently in shipping. It is hoped that factories and mines will pay attention to strengthening packaging, improving transportation efficiency, and reducing material losses.

	Empty Car Trip
	On September 20, the dispatching section of the Taiyuan Railway Administration ordered the dispatching office of the Jining Sub-bureau, with bureau order No. 2068, to send ten empty refrigerated cars to Kouquan Station in Datong District for loading. The Jining Sub-bureau dispatched them at 9:00 a.m. that day. Who knew that on the 21st, Kouquan Station hung these ten empty cars back (reportedly Kouquan did not need them). Later, they received bureau order No. 2071 from the dispatching section of the Administration, ordering these ten cars to be sent to Baotou. Similar phenomena of empty cars going back and forth have happened more than once. It is hoped that the Taiyuan Bureau will prevent similar situations from happening again.

专栏：

    珍惜每一吨运输力量
    编者按：各地正千方百计地挖掘运输潜力，缓和运输紧张情况，并且取得很大的成绩，但据读者来信反映，仍有一些地方，或则由于运输部门内部工作的缺点，或则由于托运单位、收货单位工作上的缺点，造成了运力的浪费。这里发表的五封读者来信，从不同的方面提出了这个问题，希望引起运输部门和物资部门意见。
    宽打窄用　谎报用途
    在目前铁路运力还不能完全满足运输需要的情况下，为了保证钢铁元帅升帐，保证完成重点运输任务，铁路部门采取了按轻重缓急进行排队的办法。但我们也发现某些单位还存在着本位主义思想，不从全局出发，在他们所提的计划里，宽打窄用、谎报用途、不急说急的现象很严重。如大连机车车辆厂和沈阳铁西化工厂10月份就多报七千多吨货物；有的单位将烧火用的木柴也说成是炼钢急需的物资，要求铁路部门立即给车。辽宁省有一个县的单位向铁路局要车运石头时说是水库决口用的抢救物资，铁路局派车给运去以后发现，原来是修猪圈用。像这样的例子还很多。由于各托运部门的宽打窄用和谎报用途，使铁路部门很难辨别货物的轻重缓急，甚至造成急需的运不出去，不急的反而运走了。
    希望各运货单位从全局出发，根据实际情况作出切实的运输计划，如果确实排不上队，就应自动地给钢铁元帅让路。

    “车到的不是时候”？
    我们北京市长途汽车公司的职工正千方百计挖掘潜力，保证尽快地把货物运送到收货单位，但是在我们的工作中也遇到一些困难。这就是，有些发货单位和收货单位不能很好地协作配合，延长了装卸车时间，造成压车现象。
    最近我们给河北省平谷县商业局运百货，当晚把货运到后，却无人卸车。司机一再要求商业局卸车，也不给卸，反而埋怨车到的不是时候。最后经当地交通部门帮助，才给卸了，但已延误了几个钟头。又如前几天我们从外地给西四大白厂运货，车到后也是无人卸车。司机要求厂方设法找人卸车，厂方不但不找人，反而扯起皮来，经再三交涉，也耽误了几小时。
    为了充分发挥运输潜力，不再造成压车现象，希望发货和收货单位同运输部门协作，快装快卸，使车辆发挥出应有的效率。

    一辆汽车运三个氧气瓶
    由于有些运货单位只图赶快把东西运走，不管货物多少就自己包一辆车，有些运输单位嫌并车装运太麻烦，不考虑运力的充分利用，从而造成了运力严重浪费的现象。如浙江省三门县为了运三个氧气瓶就包了一辆汽车，寿昌、余姚等县用一辆载重三千五百公斤的大卡车装运一台七百多斤重的鼓风机。无论从运输力和运费方面来看，这显然是严重的浪费。
    建议各地运输部门对承运物资，应做合理安排，使运输力量得到充分地利用。
                            （沈宏美）
    包装不牢延误时间
    最近，长江航运局接运了一批丁酸细菌肥（无锡振元化工厂出品），运抵宜昌时，全部包装纸袋都已腐烂，无法起卸，只好派了一百零三名工人重新灌袋整理，损失运力三千二百吨天。类似的事情在航运中经常发生。希望各厂矿注意加固包装，提高运输效率，减少物资损失。
                            （余国仕）
    空车旅行
    9月20日，太原铁路管理局调度科以二○六八号局令，命令集宁分局调度所解十辆空冷藏车送大同区口泉站装车，集宁分局于当日九点挂出。谁知到21日，口泉站又把这十辆空车给挂回来了（据说是口泉不要）。后来，又接到管理局调度科二○七一号局令，把这十辆车送包头。类似这种空车往返的现象还不止一次。希望太原局防止类似情况再次发生。　　（曾庆忠）（顾　朴插画）
