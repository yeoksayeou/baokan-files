Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 19th. Ship worker Zhang Jinhai successfully created the "Long-Distance Electric Driving Operation Instrument," opening a path for the automation and electrification of ship driving in our country.

Previously, ships in our country were navigated by the helmsman and engine operator under the command of the driver. This not only required many people and heavy labor intensity, but also made driving inconvenient and prone to accidents. In particular, with the widespread implementation of the push-tow method, convoys were often very long, blocking the view of the tugboat behind. The driver on the front barge would use a microphone or telephone to direct the tugboat, which was very inconvenient.

Using this remote control instrument, the driver can directly operate the ship by pressing a button. This is very flexible, accurate, and safe. The instrument is connected to the ship's machinery by electric wires, and can be moved to the front barge of the convoy when necessary for remote operation. This avoids errors and ensures the safe navigation of the convoy.

Zhang Jinhai is the chief mechanic of the No. 601 tugboat of the Hankou Port Authority. He only studied in a private school for a little over a year. During the creation process, he received guidance and assistance from the Party Committee of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Navigation Administration and the crew of the No. 601 tugboat. The Changjiang Navigation Bureau also specially sent engineer Liao Qianxin to assist them.

    张金海创造新仪器
    远距离操纵轮船
    新华社武汉19日电　轮船工人张金海创造成功“远距离电动驾驶操作仪”，为我国船舶驾驶走向自动化、电气化开辟了一条道路。
    在这以前，我国船舶航行都是由驾驶员指挥舵工和轮机工工作，不仅需要的人多，劳动强度大，主要是驾驶不灵便，容易造成事故；特别是普遍推行顶推法以后，船队往往很长，挡住了后面拖轮的视线，驾驶员在前面驳船上用话筒或电话指挥拖轮航行，很不方便。
    使用这种远距离操作仪，只要驾驶员一人一按电钮就可以直接操纵，非常灵便、准确和安全。这种操作仪是用电线和船上的机器相连的，必要时可以把它搬到船队前面的驳船上，进行远距离操纵。这样就可以避免差错，保证船队安全航行。
    张金海是汉口港务局六○一号拖轮的轮机长，只念过一年多私塾，他在创造过程中得到了长江航运管理局党委和六○一拖轮船员的指导和帮助，长江航运局还专门派了工程师廖谦心对他们进行帮助。
