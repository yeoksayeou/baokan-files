Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 21st: The artillery units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, in accordance with Minister Peng Dehuai's order at 3:00 PM on October 20, 1958, carried out punitive strikes against the ground military targets of Chiang's army in the Kinmen area and Chiang's naval vessels in the Kinmen waters at 4:00 PM on the 20th.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 21st: Our front-line reporter reported: The powerful artillery units of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front, in accordance with the order of Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai, fully resumed artillery shelling of Chiang's army in Kinmen at 4:00 PM on the 20th.

From night of the 19th to the morning of the 20th, the outpost observers who had been monitoring our territorial waters day and night, first discovered the crime of US warships escorting them. They were filled with irrepressible anger, quickly reported this situation to their superiors, and actively prepared to enter battle. They said that if US warships were escorting in the Kinmen waters, they would immediately open fire, as Minister Peng had solemnly announced in the order to suspend the shelling. Now, the Taiwan authorities dare to disregard Minister Peng's order, disregard national righteousness, and invite the wolf into the house. We must teach them a severe lesson. At 3:00 PM sharp, Minister Peng Dehuai's order to resume shelling was transmitted to the front-line artillery positions, and the gunners, who had been waiting in battle formation, quickly made all combat preparations. Countless cannons, silent for fourteen days, pointed proudly at Kinmen. At 4:00 PM, the punitive shelling began. Large groups of shells roared straight towards the positions of Chiang's army in Kinmen. The earth trembled, and the fire overwhelmed the sunset. In an instant, the positions of Chiang's army on the islands of Greater and Lesser Kinmen were engulfed in thick smoke and flames, and several Chiang's army transport ships were also hit and circled around like headless ducks. The gunners happily said, "Good hit! Another rapid-fire, let the stubborn faction in Taiwan wake up a bit."

    台湾当局引狼入室罪有应得
    无数门大炮昂首直指金门
    千万颗炮弹飞向蒋军阵地
    新华社福建前线21日电　中国人民解放军福建前线炮兵部队遵照彭德怀部长1958年10月20日下午三时的命令，于20日下午四时对金门地区蒋军地面军事目标和金门海域蒋军舰只进行了惩罚性的打击。
    新华社福建前线21日电　本社前线记者报道：福建前线人民解放军强大炮兵部队，遵照国防部彭德怀部长的命令，在20日下午四时全线恢复了对金门蒋军的炮击。
    从19日夜到20日晨，日日夜夜监视着我国领海的前哨观察兵们，首先发现了美舰护航的罪行。他们怒不可遏地一面迅速把这一情况报告了上级，一面积极准备投入战斗。他们说，金门海域如有美舰护航，立即开炮，这是彭部长在暂停炮击的命令中庄严宣布过的。现在，台湾当局竟敢无视我彭部长命令，不顾民族大义，引狼入室，我们非狠狠教训它一番不可。十五时正，彭德怀部长恢复炮击的命令传到了前线各炮位，严阵以待的炮手们迅速作好了一切战斗准备。沉寂了十四天的无数门大炮，昂首直指金门。十六时，惩罚性的炮击开始了。大群大群的炮弹呼啸着直奔金门蒋军阵地而去。大地颤动了，火光压倒了晚霞。顷刻间，大小金门等岛屿的蒋军阵地被浓烟烈火吞没了，几条蒋军运输舰也被打得像没头鸭子样的原地打圈圈。炮手们痛快地说，打得好，再来一个急速射，让台湾顽固派清醒点。
