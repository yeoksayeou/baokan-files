Hard Workouts Are Good For the Body
    Li Tiyuan, Electromechanical Section, Third Mine, Yangquan Mining Bureau
    The morning after adjusting the dormitory, I was still asleep in bed when someone shouted, "Li Tiyuan, get up! Why are you still a 'sleepyhead'? Come to the Youth League branch meeting quickly."
    At the Youth League branch, Jia Fengzhu and others said, "Our four o'clock shift wants to organize a team, and we hope everyone will participate. We will form the team today, and tomorrow we will have a match with the twelve o'clock shift. The Party branch secretary and Youth League branch secretary will both participate in our competition." I haven't played ball for a long time, and my body is weak. When I play ball, I get out of breath and can't run on the field. However, everyone decided to let me participate in tomorrow's game. I said, "Let someone else go, I can't do it, I can't handle it." Everyone said, "That's because you sleep too much! You'll be fine after a period of exercise."
    The next day, the game was scheduled for ten o'clock. We arrived at the field at eight o'clock. After two hours of practice, plus forty minutes of the match, I was so tired that I was covered in sweat and my eyes were seeing stars. I thought I wouldn't be able to go to work tomorrow. After taking a bath in the afternoon and sleeping all night, although my legs were still a little sore, I felt very comfortable. From that time on, in addition to participating in political, technical, and cultural studies every week, I always participated in four hours of sports activities. Over time, after half a year of exercise, I no longer saw stars after playing ball. Moreover, I changed from being reluctant to participate in sports activities to a sports enthusiast. More importantly, through physical exercise, my health has improved, and my work efficiency has also greatly increased compared to the past. No one calls me "sleepyhead" anymore. (Attached picture)
    After the adjustment of workers' dormitories, the labor army of combining work, study, and military affairs has been generally established in Yangquan factories and mines.
    After doing morning exercises every morning, the workers begin a day of intense labor in a fighting posture. This is a group of coal miners from the Fourth Mine marching into the pit in a mighty formation after receiving combat missions before their shift.

    勤锻炼身体好
    阳泉矿务局第三矿机电科　李体元
    在调整宿舍后的第二天早晨，我还在被窝里睡着，就有人喊我：“李体元，快起，怎么还当‘瞌睡虫’呢？快来团支部开会。”
    到团支部，听贾峰柱和大家说：“我们四点班要组织一个球队，希望大家参加。今天组织起球队，明天就要和十二点班赛球，党支部书记和团支部书记都要参加我们的比赛。”我好长时间没打球啦，身体弱，一打球，气就喘，上场跑不动。可是，大家决定让我参加明天的赛球，我说：“还是让别人去吧，咱不行，顶不下来。”大家说：“那是你睡觉睡坏啦，锻炼一个时期就会好的。”
    第二天，规定十点钟赛球，我们八点钟就来到球场，经过两小时的练球，再加上四十分钟的比赛，累的我浑身是汗，两眼直冒金花。我想，这下就怕明天上不成班了。到下午洗过澡，睡了一夜，虽然腿还有些痛，但身上觉得非常舒服。就从这次起，每星期我除参加政治、技术、文化学习外，总要参加四个小时的体育活动。这样久而久之，锻炼了半年时间，现在打球后，不但眼里不再冒金花，而且由原来懒于参加体育活动，变成了一个体育爱好者。更主要的是，通过体育锻炼，增进了我的身体健康，工作效率也比过去有很大提高，没人再叫我“瞌睡虫”了。（附图片）
    职工宿舍调整以后，阳泉各厂矿已经普遍建立亦工亦学亦兵的劳动大军。
    职工们每天早上做完早操，就以战斗的姿态，开始一天的紧张劳动。这是第四矿采煤工人在班前接受战斗任务后，浩浩荡荡整队入坑。
