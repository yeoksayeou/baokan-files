To Make Mountains Bow to Water
New Experiences in Building a Mountainous Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network in the Xiangyang Area
Zhao Xiu

Editor's Note: This article by Comrade Zhao Xiu, First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was previously published and distributed by Hubei People's Publishing House under the title "Mountainous Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network." However, it still has reference value for places across the country that have not yet or are in the process of solving water conservancy problems in mountainous and hilly areas. Therefore, Comrade Zhao Xiu has made necessary revisions and supplements for re-publication in this newspaper. Under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of agricultural cooperation, Chinese farmers have continuously created unprecedented and astonishing miracles in farmland water conservancy construction. The new experience created by farmers in the Xiangyang area of Hubei Province in building a mountainous gravity-flow irrigation network, which opens up new avenues for solving farmland water conservancy in mountainous areas, is one such miracle. Comrade Zhao Xiu's article specifically and vividly summarizes this creative new experience and is a good Marxist article with both ideological and scientific value, worthy of everyone's reference and reading.

The Xiangyang Special District is located in the northwest of Hubei Province. Under the leadership of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, and on the basis of cooperation, the water conservancy construction movement is no longer simply about repairing isolated ponds and embankments, but about establishing a complete water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network. The goal is to completely eliminate waterlogging and drought and to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development as soon as possible.

What Kind of Water Conservancy Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network Should Be Established?

The water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network is: river connecting dam, dam connecting canal, canal connecting pond. That is, using river water as the main source, diverting water from afar to irrigate fields nearby, diverting river water to irrigate canals, canal water to irrigate ponds, and pond water to irrigate fields, connecting many water conservancy projects to form a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation system. Not only should we achieve river connecting canal, canal connecting pond, but also further develop to canal connecting canal, pond connecting pond, and river connecting river.

What is canal connecting canal? That is, ensuring that the main canal does not "bow its head" (minimizing the water drop rate as much as possible). In this way, meandering around, the main canals are connected to each other, and branch canals are opened below the main canals.

What is pond connecting pond? That is, when the water in this pond is full, it flows through channels next to the pond to other ponds; when the water in reservoirs and depressions is full, it flows through spillways to other ponds.

What is river connecting river? That is, if the water in this river is not fully utilized, it is diverted through channels to another river that does not have enough water.

The development law of this water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network is: from incomplete to complete, from small network to large network.

The main form constituting this water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network is the "watermelon vine" type. The dam is like the "melon root," the diversion canal is like the "melon vine," and the embankment ponds and reservoirs are the "watermelons."

In the past, farmers only built isolated ponds and embankments without a reliable water source. Once a drought occurred, there was no water in the embankments and ponds. Now we connect all the embankments and ponds we build to river water, using the constant river flow to fill the ponds. When it rains, surface runoff from the water catchment area can also fill the ponds. Because the embankments and ponds are connected to canals, their water catchment area is also expanded.

In the past, when we built a dam, we only used its constant flow to irrigate fields during busy seasons, and let it flow away when we didn't need it. We only used the water for four months of the year, and for eight months we let the dammed river water run away in vain. Even during those four months, we didn't use it every day, and we still let some of the water run away in vain. Now we connect the river water dammed by the dam to many embankments, ponds, and reservoirs, so that we store water in slack times and use it in busy times. That is, storing water all year round and irrigating fields during busy times. As a result, even small embankments and ponds can play a big role. Embankments and ponds are like hotels. When the water in the pond is used up, it is immediately replenished with a new batch, so one embankment can be worth several.

In general, we are based on the natural terrain and water resources, conduct comprehensive surveys, unified planning, comprehensive utilization, and comprehensive management. According to the terrain, we build ponds where we can, and dig canals where we can. This is a large-scale mass movement. Of course, it is only possible to establish a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network with a large-scale mass movement.

What are the benefits of establishing a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network?

First, it achieves mutual regulation and comprehensive utilization of river water, rainwater, and groundwater.

Second, it provides comprehensive management, preventing both drought and flood, combining water storage and drainage. Because ditches, canals, embankments, and ponds are connected, it is not only easy to store water but also easy to drain water. The masses call it "double benefit."

Third, because it is gravity-flow irrigation, there is no need to expend manpower to lift water, which can greatly save labor.

Fourth, it is easy to create a mass water conservancy construction movement, which can embody the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Because it requires little labor, costs less, benefits greatly, yields quickly, ensures harvests, is technically simple, and is easy for the masses to master and accept.

Opening canals to divert river water, water can be released as soon as a section of the canal is completed. When the masses see water flowing in the canal, they are particularly enthusiastic. "Whether it rains or not, as long as there is constant flow, the rice is as good as in our mouths." The more the water flows, the more the masses work on repairing the canal. Even if the canal cannot be completed all at once, there is no danger. It is also possible to first complete and benefit from a section, and then complete it year by year. Another point is that canal repair is highly efficient because it does not require carrying soil, just using a shovel to throw the "turnover soil" outwards. At the same time, existing ditches, ponds, depressions, and dams can be utilized, transformed, and connected. What appears to be a small project becomes a large project when connected.

The Basis for Establishing a Water Conservancy Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network

The Xiangyang Special District is a low-yield area. Of the 15 million mu of cultivated land in the entire district, only 3 million mu are paddy fields. The average yield per mu of dry land is about 200 jin, while the yield per mu of paddy fields can average over 500 jin. Therefore, the masses say, "One watering is worth three droughts." Although there are many reasons for the low yield in our district, the main reason is that there is more dry land and less paddy fields. Therefore, the fundamental measure to change the low-yield situation should be to convert dry land into paddy fields.

Not only do the masses urgently demand the conversion of dry land to paddy fields, but there are also many favorable conditions for land conversion. Our district is located on both sides of the Han River in northwestern Hubei, with many rivers, streams, and springs. There are more than 980 rivers of all sizes over 20 li in the entire district, and small rivers and streams under 20 li are even "as numerous as the hairs on a cow." Especially in mountainous areas, where there are mountains, there are valleys, and where there are valleys, there must be water, with abundant water resources.

Although the masses urgently demand the conversion of dry land to paddy fields, and the natural conditions are also very suitable, it would not be possible to carry out such a mass movement to build water conservancy and establish a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network without cooperation.

After cooperation, the limitations of the past individual small-peasant economy were broken through. The change in ownership liberated productive forces, and people's thinking also changed accordingly. Farmers are now not only daring to think boldly, but also daring to do boldly. After cooperation, the masses said, "Cooperation has broadened our horizons, and we stand higher and see farther than in the past." Now, water conservancy construction has broken away from the circle of individual private ownership and considers problems from the perspective of the entire society. Not only can we consider problems from the perspective of the entire society, but we can also conduct comprehensive surveys and planning based on the society, township, county, valley, and river to fully utilize water resources. The establishment of people's communes has created extremely favorable conditions for the establishment of a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network.

Because it can unify and concentrate financial resources and allocate labor, cooperative societies have the power to run general medium-sized and small water conservancy projects themselves. Even the construction of large-scale projects is much more economical than in the past. With the establishment of people's communes, some large-scale water conservancy projects can also be run independently. The masses firmly believe that "No project is too big for the strength of the cooperative, and no difficulty is too great for the determination of the cooperative."

The masses' demand to establish a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network is the inevitable result of production development after cooperation. Just after cooperation, under the call of the Provincial Party Committee to convert dry land to paddy fields, it began to sprout. After the establishment of primary cooperatives in 1955, there was the pioneering initiative of Li Dagui, director of the Mingxing First Cooperative in Xijia Township, Jun County, to repair a four-li-long canal, divert river water to the hillside, and convert 32 mu of paddy fields. Subsequently, the masses repaired 11 canals of various sizes and have already converted 1,398 mu of paddy fields this year. In 1956, Bailian Township in Guanghua also systematically transformed and established a township-wide water conservancy irrigation and drainage system. Then there appeared the "watermelon vine" type of water conservancy system in Zhaogang Township, Guanghua.

These typical examples have been given great importance by Party committees at all levels. In particular, the Provincial Party Committee attaches great importance to these experiences. After Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally led Party secretaries from all over the province and counties to conduct on-site visits and guidance on water conservancy construction in the Xiangyang Special District, the encouragement and enlightenment to our district's cadres and masses was significant. All counties analyzed, discussed, and debated according to the conditions in their own regions. Precisely because this reflected the demands of the masses, this practice was quickly accepted by the broad masses, became their own, and was universally promoted. Not only was it promoted quickly, but it was also developed by the masses.

Specific Practices for Establishing a Water Conservancy Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network

1. Ideological Preparation

Although the change in ownership after cooperation has liberated people's minds, some people still have residual old influences in their thinking. They still dare not believe in their own strength. In particular, some well-to-do middle peasants in rural areas are more prominent. They believe that everything in the past is unchangeable. "Since ancient times, water has been carried up the mountain, how can water flow up the mountain?" And they say, "An inch of land is hard to change," "One side of water and soil feeds one side of people," "Born with a mouth for eating sweet potatoes, how can you want to eat rice?" This kind of thinking exists not only among the masses but also in the minds of some leaders, cadres, and water conservancy engineering technicians. They also think, "It couldn't be done in the past, how can it be done now?" Some water conservancy technicians say, "Such things are not in the books, so we dare not do it!"

These phenomena are not surprising. There will always be some people who do not agree with new things. This is permeated with the struggle between advanced and backward ideas, and also permeated with the struggle between two roads. Especially the well-to-do middle peasants, who are willing to engage in sideline occupations to earn cash, are unwilling to engage in basic construction, which is a reflection of capitalist thought. Moreover, these struggles run through the entire process of water conservancy construction. The law of this struggle is that at the beginning it is a question of "can it be repaired or not?" When this question is resolved, the question of "how much to repair?" will arise. There is also the question of "how to repair?" Is it using steel and concrete? Or using local materials? There are struggles at every step. When encountering difficulties in the repair process, the struggle of "can it be repaired or not?" will occur again. Some people will say, "I said it couldn't be done, but you insisted on repairing it. Let's not repair it!" A project cannot be completed without overcoming a series of difficulties and undergoing a series of struggles.

The main method to solve the thinking of these people is to carry out mass-scale airing of views, big contending, and big debates. Present the situation, present the facts, present the conditions, visit and compare, and compare yourself. Do not only make plans in the office, but go to the fields and climb to the top of the mountains to make plans. If the thinking is not clear, "look"; if you encounter difficulties, "debate"; if there is not enough labor, "calculate." This is the best method of self-education for the masses. For some people with serious conservative ideas, they must be allowed to see, to shatter their conservative ideas in the face of vivid facts. When the Party Branch Secretary of Sandaoling Township, Gucheng, attended the water conservancy meeting in the county for the first time, he only accepted the task of converting 15 mu of dry land to paddy fields; at the expanded cadre meeting in the county, it was increased to 2,000 mu; after visiting Jun County, he automatically increased it to 10,000 mu. This year, 10,060 mu have been planted with rice seedlings.

The key to advanced thinking overcoming backward thinking lies in leadership. Leaders must personally get involved, go deep, and seriously summarize various typical experiences to arm themselves and persuade the masses. Most importantly, the responsible comrades at all levels, such as the first secretary of the county Party committee, the secretary of the branch, the director of the society, and the production team leader. First of all, for these responsible persons, when encountering difficulties, do they actively lead or are they discouraged? This is like fighting a war. If the team leader's thinking is not clear, his team will not be able to move forward.

2. Comprehensive Survey and Planning

Comprehensive planning means making comprehensive plans for each county, district, township, society, and river, based on the natural terrain and adapting to local conditions. Then, according to the strength, complete them year by year, starting with the easy ones and then the difficult ones. In practice, there can be continuous modifications where things are not appropriate. In this way, the leaders have a bottom line in their minds, and the masses are also clear about it. Clarifying the goals of struggle makes the work even more energetic.

To adapt to local conditions, first of all, leaders at all levels must understand the natural conditions and water resources of the areas under their jurisdiction. How many large and small rivers are there? How many springs are there? What is the water catchment area and average rainfall of the whole county? What is the status of the original water conservancy facilities? Which terrains are suitable for what type of repair? All must be understood. Each county is divided into several major systems according to rivers, and the county Party committee also divides the work according to river systems in leading water conservancy construction.

In the field survey, it is even more important to combine leadership, technology, and the masses. Because the masses are most familiar with the local conditions, and the technical cadres have mastered new scientific knowledge, this can formulate a plan that is both advanced and practical. Gucheng Tuanhu River Reservoir was initially surveyed only by technical cadres, and could irrigate 28,000 mu of fields. Later, the county Party committee and technical cadres went to survey together, and the irrigation area increased to 40,000 mu. Later, the project was made public and discussed by the masses, and the irrigation area expanded to more than 90,000 mu. Therefore, the plan must be handed over to the masses, and fully discussed and deliberated through representative meetings, members' meetings, mass meetings, and individual interviews. Where there are different opinions, try to debate and compare them repeatedly. Also, consult the elderly to understand the historical situation in the past, so that the plan can be made more reasonable.

At the same time, leaders and the masses must not be separated from technology. Yonggu Society of Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, repaired a mountain canal. When passing by the Cypress Tomb, the masses said that the water could not flow over. The technicians used a level and said that it could flow over. The masses argued with the technicians. Some of the masses made a bet with the technical cadres, saying, "If the water can flow over, I will dig out my eyes." Others said, "If it can flow over, I will cut off my head." As a result, the canal was repaired here and the water came over. The masses all said, "A thousand eyes are not as good as one eye."

What if the technical force can't keep up with the rapid development of the movement? When the movement is fully unfolded, technicians are needed here and there, what should be done? The main way to solve this problem is for leaders, cadres, and the masses to learn technology. Cadres above the county Party committee in Jun County all have hand levels worth eight yuan each, township and society cadres have levels worth eighty cents each, and the broad masses also have various homemade levels, some made of bamboo tubes, some made of eye drops bottles, and some made of wooden levels... and so on. What if the project surface is spread too wide and the technicians can't be transferred? They adopted the method of technical cadres measuring stonework and general cadres and the masses measuring earthwork. They also trained and apprenticed people from the masses who had been artillerymen, as well as carpenters, bricklayers (who would all adjust lines), and smarter township cadres and members, and used them as water conservancy technicians. There are also some simple earthen canals that can be completed without measurement, by repairing a section of the canal and releasing a section of water. This is also the method of "water chasing people," which can also be adopted.

3. Material Preparation and Organizational Preparation

After comprehensive planning, it is necessary to make preparations for materials in advance. If local materials can be used, use them as much as possible. If there are no local materials, try to find substitutes that do not affect the quality.

Before construction, the labor force must be organized well to avoid chaotic troops. At the start of construction, a groundbreaking ceremony should also be held to explain the situation and benefits of the project to the masses in detail, and the contracting plan and mutual benefit issues should also be explained to the masses, and guide the masses to calculate the increased production and the personal increase in income of the members. In this way, the hoes of the masses will be "hard."

With the increased enthusiasm of the masses, they have also thought of various ways to improve tools and increase efficiency. Guanghua County proposed "No need to carry soil with poles, no need to tap the rammer by hand." Jun County proposed "Use plows instead of digging, use rollers instead of tamping, use clod crushers instead of carrying." Various counties have invented and improved more than 70 kinds of tools, such as pulleys, cranes, automatic unloading vehicles, rail double-vehicle soil transportation method, balance double-hook soil lifting method, sky bridge single-hook soil transportation method, aerial silk transportation method, as well as roller tamping method, human lifting tamping method... and so on. Specialized teams were also divided according to technical expertise. In short, we must implement the principle of year-round preparation, winter and spring assault, and year-round consolidation. For large projects, permanent stonework teams and technical professional teams should also be established.

How to Establish a "Watermelon Vine" Type of Water Conservancy Gravity-Flow Irrigation Network?

1. "Melon Root" (Dam)

In the past, we thought that rivers flow in low places and cannot irrigate fields. We have not yet realized that river water flows from high places to low places. The masses say, "Water flows a hundred steps, it will be three feet lower." If we take large mountainous areas as an example, the water flows rapidly from the top of the valley, which is more than "three feet lower in a hundred steps," but "three zhang lower in a hundred steps." If we start from this point of view, we can adopt the method of "diverting water from afar and irrigating fields nearby" and "diverting water from afar and climbing mountains nearby." If we divert river water from a very far place, we can choose many good terrains for "diversion without dams" and "diversion with simple dams." Without building dams with steel and concrete, we can still divert river water for gravity-flow irrigation. As long as we choose a good terrain, even large-scale water conservancy projects are possible. For example, the Zao Yang Ji River Canal and the Nanzhang Juji Canal are both large projects that irrigate 300,000 mu, and they also adopt the method of diverting water without dams. Because it is diversion without dams, the masses can also run it themselves.

The use of river water should also be small rivers first and then large rivers, tributaries first and then main streams. Because small rivers flow into large rivers, and tributaries flow into main streams, the smaller the river, the higher the elevation, and the easier it is to use and the easier it is to divert water up the hillside. Because the river is small, even building a dam is very simple. This can fully utilize the inherent methods of the masses in the past. We now have the following forms:

1. Diversion without dams. Just dig a diversion canal from one side of the river. As long as the terrain is good and the riverbed is high, the water can be diverted.

2. Where the sand layer in the river is thick and there are many undercurrents, dig the river four or five feet deep, pad it with some loess, and nail a few wooden stakes on top, and place a few stones on it. The masses call this the "iron threshold," which can also raise the water level.

3. Piling-stone permeable dam. Blocking some stones in the middle of the river can also play a role in blocking water. Divert the water into the canal.

4. There are also turf rolling dams, wooden stake dams, wooden horse dams, wooden box dams, and bamboo cage dams (that is, dams built with wooden boxes and bamboo cages filled with stone).

The above are all a form of diversion without dams and diversion with simple dams.

5. Yellow earth and stone impermeable dam and steel and concrete scouring dam.

6. In places where the river is small and the belly is large and the foundation is solid, the river water can be tied up with large stones mixed with yellow earth, which can also be made into a living reservoir, also called "regulating reservoir." When the reservoir water is full, it will flow into the pond along the canal.

The characteristics of all these dams are that they conduct comprehensive planning from the source of a river, tying up depressions and repairing canals and diverting water at every step. In the process of tying up depressions at every step, there are also dams built in the middle of the river, with canals opened on both sides. This is called the "eight-character canal." In addition, there are also those that use springs as "melon roots."

These different forms can be flexibly adopted according to different natural terrains, but under the current conditions, the form of "diversion without dams" and "diversion with simple dams" is mainly adopted.

2. "Melon Vines" (Diversion Canals)

In order to divert river water and irrigate more fields, the canals must be made long and repaired high. If the main canal bows too much, the canal will inevitably not be able to be repaired long, because once it bows its head, the water will flow into the ditch, and the canal will be declared over and cannot be extended any further. Only by repairing the canals high and long can we divert water up the mountain, so that the project is connected to the project, forming a water conservancy gravity-flow irrigation network, that is, connecting these projects with canals. Without canals, these projects cannot be connected.

When repairing the canal, it is also necessary to follow the curves and bumps, and go around the hills and highlands. This can not only irrigate more fields, but also avoid or reduce the construction of structures, and can also use some old ditches and old canals, which not only occupy less cultivated land, but also save labor. If only straight canals are built, for the sake of beauty, not only will fewer fields be irrigated, but the mountains must be split and the ditches must be filled, and if the ditches are too deep, structures must be built. When good land is encountered, it must also be dug away, and the canals are easy to bow their heads.

The canals we build are not only for diverting river water, but also for intercepting floods. From this point of view, the width and depth of the canal should not only be designed according to the constant flow of river water or spring water, but also according to the requirement of storing part of the flood. It must be wider and larger than a general constant flow canal. This can avoid the canal being broken when there is a big flood.

In constructing canal structures, we must try to summarize the inherent experiences of the masses and adopt a variety of forms. To pass over a mountain, it is necessary to adopt the method of "turning". When it is difficult to build a mountain road on a high mountain, or it is more economical compared with building a mountain road, it can be tunneled. In the case of small mountains with not much earthwork, the mountains can also be split open.

To cross a ditch, the following methods can be adopted: ① Build an aqueduct. ② Culvert. ③ Inverted siphon: Some are made of wood, some are made of cement, and some are made by kiln burning. The wooden ones are also very strong. The masses said, "Dry for a thousand years, wet for ten thousand years, half a year for one dry and one wet." They also said, "Wind and sun, three to five years, submerged in water, forever." Therefore, we still try to make wooden ones, which can not only use local materials, but also be durable. ④ Some small ditches can also be crossed with criss-cross dams. ⑤ It is also possible to make a through-pond canal, but the water can only flow away after the pond is filled, which has the disadvantage of not being smooth, so it is generally not suitable. ⑥ Make a terrace canal: A terrace canal is made in a low-lying area to prevent the water from bowing its head. This refers to the earthen terrace canal. Some are made of stone on one side when encountering steep rocky cliffs or easily collapsed rock layers, such as mica schist, to form a terrace canal. The masses said, "There is no trick in building a stone canal, just dig the foundation well."

In short, the higher the canal is repaired, the more fields it can irrigate, and the longer the canal is repaired, the larger the area of water coming from the mountain side will be. When the canal is repaired long, not to mention that there is still constant river water for irrigation, even if it is a dry ditch, as long as there is a little rain, the water in the canal will be gurgling. Therefore, if there is no constant flow, it is also good to dig a dry ditch into the pond. There are more favorable conditions in mountainous areas. If there is a ditch in the mountainous area, there will be a little constant flow. The longer the canal is repaired, the more constant flow it will receive, and the larger the canal water will be.

If the canal is too long, the masses will not be able to see the bottom. The masses at the head of the canal are afraid that the masses below will share their water, so they want to bow their heads as soon as they leave their own society. The masses at the tail of the canal are afraid that the water will not flow down and their labor will be wasted. They said, "Anyway, the water can't flow over, what's the use of repairing it like that!" Others said: "It's not too late for us to repair it after the water flows over." In addition to giving the masses a detailed calculation of the accounts and explaining the situation clearly, we can also take the method of repairing a section of the canal and releasing a section of water. When the masses at the head of the canal see that the water has flowed for a section and the water is still not used up, they will continue to repair it, and they will have no objection. When the masses at the tail of the canal see the water flowing over, they will actively participate. Repairing a section of the canal and releasing a section of water is also an inspection of our project quality. If the water does not flow over, we can dig it again. If the canal collapses, it can be detected and repaired in time.

3. "Watermelons" (Ponds, Reservoirs, Depressions)

Yonggu Society of Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, initially only opened canals to divert water, repairing a 13-li-long canal. There was no water storage weir dug under the canal. When it came time to use water, the contradictions between the teams were very large. The members described the contradiction as "Teams 1, 2, and 3 are stable" (at the head of the canal), "Teams 4, 5, and 6 are flustered" (in the middle of the canal), "Teams 7, 8, and 9 are raising their feet and watching" (at the tail of the canal). In order to solve this contradiction, everyone came up with the idea of digging water storage ponds under the canal. Adopt the method of storing water all year round and irrigating fields during busy times. Therefore, with "melon roots" and "melon vines", it is necessary to have "watermelons". The watermelons we are referring to are ponds, reservoirs, depressions, dams and ditches that can store water. After tying up depressions at every step, it is necessary to dig spillways, so that the water of this depression can overflow into the pond below when the water is high. We can also take the method of combining bridge repair and gate repair, and adopt the method of draining large water and storing small water. In addition, we should also pay attention to using soaked paddy fields to store water. One mu of soaked paddy fields can irrigate three mu of fields. If there are "melon vines" without "watermelons", the constant water will still flow away in vain. If there are only "watermelons" without "melon vines", it will be a "lone melon", which will become a "dry melon" when there is a drought.

In the past, we only had "melon vines" without "watermelons". A flow rate of one cubic meter per second (hereinafter referred to as "cubic meter/second") can only irrigate 10,000 mu of fields. Then we have "watermelons", "storing water all year round, irrigating fields during busy times", it is not 10,000 mu. How much is it actually? We also calculated it: a flow rate of one cubic meter/second means one cubic meter of water flows per second; 24 hours a day, a total of 86,400 cubic meters of water flows; 360 days a year, that is 33.1 million cubic meters of water. Calculated at 300 cubic meters of water to irrigate one mu of field, such a flow rate can irrigate 100,000 mu.

Some people will say, what about evaporation and consumption? Then we haven't calculated the amount of water in the catchment area! Let's calculate it more carefully: every year, calculated at 800 mm of rain, it is even more than 100,000 mu! Our district in 1957 was a major drought year, and from May to August, there was 150 mm of rain, which is equivalent to 100 cubic meters of water when it falls on one mu of field. In an average year, 400 mm of rain will fall from May to August, which is equivalent to 260 cubic meters of water. This only calculates the rain that falls on the fields. If we add the rainwater in the catchment area on both sides of the canal and store it in the weirs and ponds, wouldn't there be even more?

Du Cao River in Zhaogang Township, Guanghua County, has a flow rate of 0.06 cubic meter/second. According to one cubic meter/second to irrigate 10,000 mu, it can only irrigate 600 mu. They tied up this small river in 25 places and built 25 canals, which can irrigate 10,000 mu of fields. Does that mean one cubic meter/second of water only irrigates 100,000 mu? It's not true. There's a lot more to it! That is to say, if you block one cubic meter/second of water in this section, it disappears from below, but after a mile it appears again, and after two miles the water is larger, and after five or six miles it returns to its original state. The masses call this "water returns to its original state after ten miles," and some say "upper interception and lower flow."

The Guanshan River in Jun County used to have only two canals, which could irrigate 3,800 mu of fields. Before liberation, Jinpi Township had a big bully who built a Jinpi Canal, which only irrigated 3,500 mu of fields. He was afraid that there would not be enough water, so he did not allow others to build canals within 100 li upstream. Zhanggong Canal was built 99 li away from here, and it only irrigated 300 mu of fields. Now we have increased it to 14 canals, which irrigate more than 30,000 mu of fields. From below, the water has not decreased. Not only has it not decreased, but in the dry season, the water flows even larger. But in the flood season, the water is reduced. This is the result of tying up depressions and diverting water at every step: in the flood, it swallows part of the flood, and after the flood, it slowly spits it out.

From these countless facts, we dare to boldly break the old rule that one cubic meter/second of water only manages 10,000 mu of fields.

4. Gradually Complete the Water Conservancy System Year by Year

It is impossible to repair all the canals very long within a year; it is also impossible to repair all the weirs and ponds very well. The "watermelon vine" type of water conservancy system should be completed gradually year by year. That is to say, the melon vines are getting longer and longer, the watermelons are getting more and more, and the watermelons are getting bigger and bigger. That is to say, "six additions" should be carried out year by year: strengthening, widening, lengthening, adding ponds (reservoirs), adding greening, and adding fields. This is a process of development from incomplete to complete, from small network to large network.

5. Repairing Water Conservancy, Storing Water, and Converting Fields at the Same Time

Repairing, storing, and converting at the same time means benefiting from the repair. "Canal completed, water flowing, weir full, fish swimming, trees becoming forests" is the wish of the masses. The masses not only want big benefits, but also fast benefits.

In order to achieve this goal, we must also convert fields according to the terrain, based on the principle of less labor and more fields, following the curves, circles, squares, and squares. In the beginning, convert more small pieces, and convert them into moon shapes, gourd shapes, trumpet shapes, rectangle shapes, straw hat shapes, etc., according to the terrain. As long as it meets the principles of less labor, more fields, and fast benefits. Then we will gradually organize it year by year, from small pieces to large pieces; do not want to make it look good from the beginning, convert large fields, and the labor force cannot be allocated. The task of converting fields will fall by the wayside.

In order to ensure the completion of the task of converting fields, we must make overall arrangements and convert fields in stages. Some are to convert fields before repairing water conservancy; others are to repair and convert at the same time, leaving a small part to be repaired and then converted. In the past, our field conversion was mostly concentrated after water conservancy construction, during the busy season of wheat harvesting and rice transplanting, because there was no overall arrangement. At that time, we were busy

    要使山为水低头
    襄阳地区兴修山区自流灌溉网的新经验
    赵修
    编者按：中共襄阳地委第一书记赵修同志这篇文章，曾经以“山区的自流灌溉网”为题由湖北人民出版社出版发行。但是，对于全国尚未或正在解决山区和丘陵区水利问题的地方仍有参考价值，因此由赵修同志作了必要的修改和补充在本报重行发表。我国农民在党的领导下和农业合作化的基础上，在农田水利建设方面不断创造出空前的惊人奇迹，湖北襄阳地区农民创造了建设山区自流灌溉网的新经验，为解决山区农田水利开辟了新的道路，就是这种奇迹之一。赵修同志的文章具体而生动地总结了这一创造的新经验，是一篇具有思想性和科学性的马克思主义的好文章，值得大家参考阅读。
    襄阳专区在湖北省的西北部。在中央和省委的领导下，在合作化的基础上，兴修水利运动已经不是单纯的修孤塘、孤埝，而是建立一个完整的水利自流灌溉网。目的是彻底消灭水旱灾害，提早实现农业发展纲要。
        建立什么样的水利自流灌溉网
    水利自流灌溉网就是：河连坝、坝连渠、渠连塘。也就是以利用河水为主，远处引水近处灌田，引河水灌渠，渠水灌塘，塘水灌田，把许多水利工程连结起来，构成一个水利自流灌溉系统。不但做到河连渠、渠连塘，还要进一步发展到渠连渠、塘连塘、河连河。
    什么叫渠连渠？就是做到干渠不低头（尽量把水的降差率减少一点），这样盘来盘去，干渠与干渠相连，干渠下面开支渠。
    什么叫塘连塘？就是这个塘的水满了，再从塘旁边通过渠道流到别的塘里去；库与壋的水满了，通过溢洪道流到别的塘里去。
    什么叫河连河？就是这条河的水用不完，经过渠道引到另外一条水不够用的河里去。
    这个水利自流灌溉网的发展规律是：由不完整到完整，由小网到大网。
    构成这种水利自流灌溉网的主要形式是“西瓜秧（蔓）”式的。拦水坝好比是“瓜根”，引水渠好比“瓜秧”，埝塘与水库就是结的“西瓜”。
    以往，农民都是修孤塘、孤埝，没有可靠的水源，天一旱，埝塘里就都没有水了。我们现在是把所修的埝塘都与河水连起来，用常流的河水灌塘。下了雨，承雨面积里面的地面径流同样还可以灌塘。由于埝塘通了渠，还扩大了它的承雨面积。
    过去，我们做个拦河坝，只是到了忙时才用它的常流水灌田，不用了就让它流去。一年只有四个月用水，八个月就完全把拦住的河水让它白白地流跑了。就是这四个月，也不是天天在用水，也还是把一部分水白流跑了。我们现在是让拦河坝的河水与许多埝塘、水库联系起来，做到闲时蓄水忙时用。也就是常年蓄水，忙时灌田。这样做的结果，小埝塘也能起大作用。埝塘好比是招待所，塘里的水用完了，就马上再补充一批来，这样一个埝塘就能顶好几个用。
    总的说来，我们是根据自然地形与水利资源，全面勘察，统一规划，综合利用，综合治理。根据地形能修塘就修塘，能挖渠就挖渠，这是一个大规模的群众运动。当然，建立水利自流灌溉网，也只有大规模的群众运动才有可能。
    建立水利自流灌溉网有哪些好处呢？
    第一，达到对河水、雨水、地下水，三者互相调剂，全面利用。
    第二，综合治理，既防旱，又防涝，蓄水与排水相结合。由于沟渠、埝塘相连，不但容易蓄水，而且容易排水，群众称为“双受益”。
    第三，由于是自流灌溉，也就不用再费人力车水了，这样就可以大大地节省劳力。
    第四，这样做容易造成群众性的兴修水利运动，能体现多快好省的方针。因为这样做费工小，花钱少，受益大，收益快，能保收，技术简单，群众容易掌握，容易接受。
    开渠引河水，修通一段渠就能放水。群众一见渠里流水，情绪特别高涨。“下雨不下雨，只要有了常流水，稻谷就等于吃到嘴边来了”。水越流，群众修渠的劲越大。就是渠不能一时全部修通，也没有什么危险性。先修通一段先受益，以后再逐年修通它，也是可以的。再一点就是修渠工效高，因为它不要挑土，只用铁锨往外摔个“翻身土”就行了。同时还可以把旧有沟、塘、壋、坝加以利用、改造，连结起来。看来是小工程，一连起来就成了大工程。
        建立水利自流灌溉网的根据
    襄阳专区是个低产地区。全区一千五百万亩耕地，其中水田才有三百万亩。旱地每亩平均产量二百斤左右，水田每亩产量就可以平均到五百斤以上。所以群众说“一水能顶三旱”。我区低产原因虽然很多，但主要原因是旱地多，水田少。因而改变低产面貌的根本措施应该是旱地改水田。
    不但群众迫切要求旱改水，而且有很多改田的有利条件。我区位于鄂西北汉江两岸，河多，溪多，泉多。全区二十华里以上的大小河流有九百八十多条，二十里以下的小河小溪更是“多如牛毛”。特别是山区，有山就有沟，有沟必有水，水利资源丰富。
    虽然群众迫切要求旱改水，自然条件也很适合，但是如果没有合作化，也不可能开展这样一个群众性的兴修水利、建立水利自流灌溉网的运动。
    合作化后，过去个体小农经济的限制突破了。所有制的改变使生产力得到解放，人的思想也随着变了。农民现在不但敢大胆的想，而且也敢大胆的做。合作化后群众说：“合作化开阔了我们的眼界，与过去比较起来，站得高，望得远了”。现在兴修水利已经摆脱了个体私有的圈子，而是从全社来考虑问题。不但能从全社考虑问题，而且还能够以社、以乡、以县、以沟、以河进行全面勘察，全面规划，做到充分利用水利资源。人民公社的建立，更为建立水利自流灌溉网创造了极为有利的条件。
    因为能够统一集中财力和调配劳力，所以一般的中小型水利工程，合作社都有力量自办了。就是兴建大型工程，也比过去节省多了。成立了人民公社，一些大型水利工程也能自办了。群众坚定的相信：“工程再大，没有合作社的力量大；困难再大，没有合作社的决心大”。
    群众建立水利自流灌溉网的要求，是合作化后生产发展的必然结果。刚刚合作化，在省委旱改水的号召下，就开始有了萌芽。1955年成立初级社后，就出现了均县习家店明星一社主任李大贵修四里长渠，引河水上山坡，改三十二亩水田的创举。接着群众又修了大小十一条渠，今年已经改到一千三百九十八亩水田。1956年光化白莲乡也有计划地改造与建立了全乡性的水利排灌系统。接着又出现了光化赵岗乡“西瓜秧”式的水利系统。
    这些典型，各级党委都十分重视。特别是省委对这些经验非常重视。省委第一书记王任重同志亲自带领全省各地、县委书记，对襄阳专区水利建设进行现场参观指导以后，对我区干部与群众的鼓舞启示很大。各县都对照本地区的情况进行了分析、讨论、辩论。正因为这是反映了群众的要求，这个做法很快就被广大群众接受，变成群众自己的东西，普遍推广开了。不但推广得很快，而且又被群众发展了。
        建立水利自流灌溉网的具体作法
    一、思想准备
    虽然合作化后由于所有制的改变，人的思想也随着解放了。但总还是有一部分人思想里存在着残余的旧的影响。他们还是不敢相信自己的力量。特别是农村一部分富裕中农表现得更为突出。他们认为，过去的一切事情都是不可改变的，“自古以来水都是挑上山，哪里能把水流上山”？并说“寸土难易”，“一方水土养一方人”，“生定了吃红薯的嘴，想吃大米怎样能行呢？”这种思想，不但群众里面有，一部分领导人员、干部和水利工程技术人员的思想里也有。他们也认为，“过去办不到，现在这样做怎能行呢？”一些水利技术人员说：“这样的事情书本上没有可不敢办呀！”
    这些现象并不奇怪。新生的事物总是会有些人不赞成的。这里面贯穿着先进思想与落后思想的斗争，也贯穿着两条道路的斗争。特别是富裕中农，愿搞副业抓现钱，不愿搞基本建设，这也就是资本主义思想的反映。而且这些斗争贯穿到兴修水利的整个过程中。这种斗争的规律，开始是“能修不能修”的问题。等到这一个问题解决了，又会出现“修多修少”的问题。还有是“怎样修法？”是用钢骨水泥？还是就地取材？步步有斗争。修的过程中遇到困难，又会发生“能修不能修”的斗争。有的人会说：“我说办不到，你们一定要修，还是不修吧！”一个工程不克服一连串的困难，不经过一连串的斗争，是不可能完成的。
    解决这些人的思想的主要方法，就是开展群众性的大鸣大放大争。摆情况，摆事实，摆条件，参观评比，对照自己。不要只在办公室里做规划，要到田间，要爬到山头上去做规划。思想不通就“看”，遇到困难就“辩”，劳动力不够就“算”，这是群众自我教育的最好方法。对一些保守思想严重的人，必须让他们去看，在生动的事实面前来粉碎他们的保守思想。谷城三道岭乡支部书记第一次到县里开水利会议时，只接受旱改水十五亩的任务；县里又开扩干会，增加到二千亩；到均县参观了以后，又自动增加到一万亩了。今年已经实插秧一万零六十亩。
    先进思想战胜落后思想的关键在于领导。领导必须亲自动手，深入下去，把各种典型经验认真总结起来，武装自己，说服群众。最重要的是各级领导的负责同志，如县委第一书记、支部书记、社主任、生产队长。首先是这些负责人，遇到困难是积极领导呢？还是灰心丧气呢？这和打仗一样，如果队长思想不通，他那一队人也就调不上去。
    二、全面勘察和规划
    所谓全面规划，就是根据自然地形，因地制宜地做出每个县、每个区、每个乡、每个社、每条河的全面规划来。然后再根据力量先易后难、逐年完成。在实践中有不合适的地方还可以不断修改。这样，领导人心中有了底，群众心里也就亮堂了。明确了奋斗目标，干劲也就更大了。
    要想做到因地制宜，首先就是各级领导要把自己所辖地区的自然情况和水利资源摸清楚。有多少大小河流？有多少泉眼？全县承雨面积与平均雨量有多大？原有水利设施的状况，哪些地形适合修什么？都得要摸清楚。每个县都按河流分成几个大系，在领导兴修水利当中县委也是按河系分工。
    在实地勘察中，更重要的是要做到领导、技术、群众三者相结合。因为群众最熟悉自己当地情况，再加上技术干部掌握了新的科学知识，这样就能制定出既先进而又合乎实际的规划来。谷城团湖河水库，开始只是技术干部勘察，能灌田二万八千亩；后来县委与技术干部一起去勘察，灌溉面积就增加到四万亩了；后来工程公开，让群众讨论，灌溉面积又扩大到九万多亩了。因此规划必须要交给群众，通过代表会、社员会、群众会、个别访问等形式，充分讨论酝酿，有不同意见尽量做到反复辩论、比较。还要向老年人请教，了解过去的历史情况，这样才能把规划做得更合理。
    同时，领导与群众也不能脱离技术。光化赵岗乡永固社修一条盘山渠，经过柏树坟时，群众都说水流不过来。技术人员用水平仪一照，说能流过来。群众与技术员争吵起来。有的群众跟技术干部打赌说：“如果水能流过来，把我的眼睛挖了。”也有的说：“要是能流过来，把我的脑袋割了。”结果渠修到这里水过来了。群众都说：“千眼不如一眼。”
    运动发展得很快，技术力量赶不上怎么办呢？运动全面展开了，这里要技术员去，哪里也要技术员去，怎么办呢？解决这一问题主要办法就是领导和干部与群众都学习技术。均县县委以上的干部都有八元钱一个的手水平仪，乡社干部都有八毛钱一个的水平仪，广大群众还有各种各样的土制水平仪，有竹筒的，有用眼药瓶做的，也有木水平仪……等等。工程面铺得太大，技术员调不过来怎么办呢？他们就采取技术干部测量石方，一般干部与群众测量土方的办法。他们把群众中当过炮兵的，以及木匠、砌匠（他们都会调线）、聪明一点的乡干部和社员加以短期训练和实习，也当成水利技术人员来使用。也有一些简单的土渠，不用测量，修一段渠放一段水，也能修通。这也就是“水赶人走”的方法，也同样可以采用。
    三、器材准备与组织准备
    全面规划后，紧接着要提早做好器材的准备。能就地取材的尽量就地取材。当地没有的，在不影响质量的前提下，能找代用品的尽量找代用品。
    开工前，要把劳动力组织好，避免乱兵上阵。开工时，还应当举行一个开工典礼大会，把修这个工程的情况与好处详细讲给群众听，包工方案与互利问题也要给群众讲清楚，并引导群众算好增产账与社员个人增加收入的细账。这样，群众的镢头下去才是“硬”的。
    群众的劳动积极性提高了，还想了各种各样的办法改良工具，提高效率。光化县提出“运土不用担子担，打夯不用手来掂”。均县提出“以犁代挖，以碾代夯，以耖代挑”。各县共发明和改良了七十多种工具，如滑车、吊车、自动卸土车、有轨双车运土法、天平式双钩吊土法、天桥单钩运土法、空中滑丝运土法，还有轱辘式打夯法、人搬打夯法……等等。还根据技术特长分了专业班子。总之，我们要贯彻执行全年准备，冬春突击，和全年巩固的方针。对大工程还要建立常年石工队与技术专业队。
    怎样建立“西瓜秧（蔓）”式的水利自流灌溉网？
            一、“瓜根”（拦河坝）
    过去我们认为河在低处流，不能灌田。我们还没有想到，河水都是从地势高处往低处流的。群众说：“水流百步要低三尺。”如果拿大山区来说，水是从沟脑往下急流的，那就不止是“百步低三尺”，而是“水流百步低三丈”了。如果从这个观点出发，我们就可以采用“远处引水，近处灌田”、“远处引水，近处上山”的方法。如果从很远的地方去引河水，就可以选择很多“无坝引水”和“简单坝引水”的好地形。不用钢骨水泥筑坝，同样可以把河水引来自流灌溉。只要选择了好地形，就是大型水利工程也是可以的。如枣阳吉河大渠和南漳九集大渠，都是灌溉三十万亩的大工程，也是采取的无坝引水的方法。由于是无坝引水，所以群众也就可以自办。
    利用河水也应当是先小河后大河，先支流后主流。因为小河是往大河里流的，支流是往主流里流的，所以越是小河越在高处，也就越容易利用，越容易引水上山坡。由于河小，就是做个拦河坝也很简单。这就可以充分运用群众过去固有的办法。我们现在采取的有这样几种形式：
    1、无坝引水，从河的一旁只挖引水渠就行了。只要选择了地势好，河床高的地形，就能把水引上来。
    2、河里沙层厚的地方，暗流多，把河挖它四、五尺深，垫上一些黄土，上面钉上几根木桩，摆上几块石头就行了，群众把这叫做“铁门坎”，也能把水位抬高起来。
    3、堆石透水坝，在河当中堵一些石头，也能起一点拦水作用。把水引到渠里面来。
    4、还有草皮滚水坝、木桩坝、木马坝、木箱坝、竹笼坝（就是用木箱竹笼装石块筑的坝）。
    以上这些都是属于一种无坝引水与简单坝引水的形式。
    5、黄土块石不透水坝和钢骨水泥滚水坝。
    6、在河小肚子大、地基坚固的地方，用大块石掺黄土把河水扎起来，也可以做成活水库，活水库也叫做“调节水库”，库水满了就顺渠灌到堰塘里去。
    所有这些坝的特点，都是从一条河的发源地起，进行全面规划，节节扎壋、节节修渠引水。在节节扎壋当中，也有在河中间筑坝，两面开渠的。这叫“八字渠”。另外也有用泉眼当“瓜根”的。 
    这几种不同形式，可根据不同的自然地形灵活采用，但是在目前条件下主要还是采取“无坝引水”与“简单坝引水”的形式。
            二、“瓜秧”（引水渠道）
    为了把河水引出来，灌的田多，必须把渠道做得长、修得高。干渠低头太多，渠道就必然不能修长，因为它猛一低头，水往沟里一流，这条渠就算宣告结束，再不能继续延长了。只有把渠道修高修长，才能做到引水上山，所谓工程连工程，构成水利自流灌溉网，也就是用渠道把这些工程连接起来。没有渠道，这些工程也就不可能连接起来了。
    在修渠的时候还要随弯就弯，随凸就凸，绕着山岗与高地转行。这样不但可以多灌田，还可以不修或少修建筑物，也能利用一些旧沟旧渠，既少占耕地，又可以省工。如果只修直渠，图好看，不但少灌田，还得逢山劈山，逢沟填方，沟太深的还得做建筑物，遇到好地也得挖掉，渠道也容易低头。
    我们修的渠道，不但是为了引河水，而且还要拦蓄洪水。从这一观点出发，渠道的宽度和深度，就不能只根据河水或泉水的常流量来设计，而要按照蓄一部分洪水的要求来设计。要比一般常流量的渠道宽大一些才行。这就可以避免洪水大的时候把渠冲破。
    做渠道建筑物，要尽量总结群众固有经验，采取多种多样的形式。过山要采取“转”的办法，在山高不易盘山或是和盘山比较起来还可以省工的情况下，可以穿洞。山小土方不多的情况下，也可以把山劈开。
    遇沟过水可以采取：①做渡槽。②涵洞。③倒虹吸：有木做的，有水泥做的，有烧窑制的。木做的也很结实。群众说：“干千年，湿万年，一干一湿只半年。”又说：“风吹日晒，三年五载，用水一淹，千古万载。”所以我们还是尽量做木制的，既可以就地取材，又经久耐用。④有些小沟也可以打交叉坝。⑤也可以做穿塘渠，但穿塘渠是灌满塘后水才能流走，有流水不痛快的缺点，一般不宜采用。⑥做台渠：低洼地做台渠，是为了水不低头，这是指土台渠；也有的是遇到石崖陡壁，炸山太费工，或遇到容易倒塌的石层，如云片石，就用石头砌一面，做成台渠。群众说：“砌石渠没有巧，只要把根脚挖好。”
    总之，渠修得越高，它灌的田就越多，渠修得越长，它的靠山一侧来水的面积也就越大。渠道修长了，不要说还有常流的河水灌溉，就是干沟，只要是少下一点雨，地上稍动一点流，渠里面的水也是哗哗响。因此，如果没有常流水，就是挖一道干沟通到塘里也有好处。山区有利条件更多一些，山区有沟就会有一点常流水，渠修得越长，接的这些常流水就会越多，渠水就会越大。
    渠道太长了，群众就会摸不到底。渠首的群众怕下面的群众分他们的水，所以一出自己的社就想低头。渠尾的群众怕水流不下来，白费了工。他们说：“横直水也流不过来，修那样好干什么呀！”还有的说：
  “水流过来，我们再修也不晚。”除过详细给群众算账、交代清楚情况以外，还可以采取修一段渠放一段水的办法。渠首的群众看到水流了一段，水还是用不完，下面接着再修，他们也就没意见了。渠尾群众一看水流过来了，他们也就会积极起来。渠道修好一段就放一段水，对我们的工程质量也是一个检查，如果水过不来，还可以再挖一挖；渠塌了也可以及时发觉，修补起来。
            三、“西瓜”（塘、水库、壋）
    光化县赵岗乡永固社，开始只是开渠引水，修一条十三里的长渠。渠下面没有挖蓄水堰。到了用水的时候，队与队之间矛盾很大，社员把这个矛盾形容成“一二三队稳稳当当”（在渠首），“四五六队慌慌张张”（在渠中），“七八九队提起脚跟望”（在渠尾）。为了解决这个矛盾，大家想出渠下面挖蓄水塘。采用长年蓄水忙时灌田的办法。所以有了“瓜根”，有了“瓜秧”，还必须结“西瓜”。我们所指的西瓜，就是能蓄水的塘、库、壋、坝、沟。节节扎壋以后，必须要挖溢洪道，水大了这个壋的水还可以溢到下面塘里；也可以采取修桥与修闸相结合的方法，采取大水排小水蓄的方法；另外也可以注意用泡水田蓄水，一亩泡水田的水也能灌三亩田。如果有了“瓜秧”，不结“西瓜”，常水还是会白白地流掉。如果只有“西瓜”，没有“瓜秧”，那就是“孤瓜”，天一旱就成了“干瓜”了。
    过去我们只是有“瓜秧”，没有结“西瓜”，一个秒立公方的流量（以下简称方），只能灌一万亩田，那么我们结了“西瓜”，“常年蓄水，忙时灌田”，那就不是一万亩了。到底是多少呢？我们也计算了一下：一个流量就是一秒钟流一方水；一天二十四小时，共计要流八万六千四百方水；一年三百六十天，那就是三千三百一十万方水。按三百方水灌一亩田计算，这样一个流量就可以灌到十万亩。
    有人又会说，还有蒸发消耗呢？那么我们还没有把承雨面积内的水量计算在内呢！再过细计算一下：每年就按八百公厘雨计算，比十万亩还要多得多呢！我区1957年是个大旱年，5月至8月还下了一百五十公厘雨，下到一亩田里就顶一百方水，普通年成5月至8月份要落雨四百公厘，就能顶二百六十方水。这还只是算落到田里的雨，如果加上渠道两旁承雨面积内的雨水，也把它蓄到堰塘里，那不就更多了吗？
    光化县赵岗乡杜槽河，是零点零六的流量。按一个流量灌一万亩，它只能灌到六百亩。他们把这条小河扎了二十五道，修了二十五条渠，可灌到一万亩田。那么说一个流量的水，只灌十万亩吗？还不是的。里面的文章还多呢！那就是说，这一节把一个流量的水堵住了，从下面看没有了，过上一里路又有了，再过两里路水又大了，再过上五、六里又恢复原状了。群众把这叫做“水过十里又还原”，也有的说是“上截下流”。
    均县官山河，过去只有两条渠，能灌三千八百亩田。解放前金陂乡有个大恶霸修了一个金陂大渠，才灌三千五百亩田。他怕水不够用，上游一百里路以内不准别人修渠。距这里九十九里处修了一个张公渠，才灌三百亩田，现在我们增加到十四条渠，灌三万多亩田，从下面来看水并没有减少。不但没有减少，到枯水季节相反的水更流得大了。可是到洪水季节水倒是减少了。这就是由于节节扎壋引水的结果：到洪水时吞纳了一部分洪水，洪水过后，它又慢慢地吐出来了。
    从这无数的事实证明，就使我们敢大胆地把过去一个流量只管一万亩田的陈规给打破了。
            四、逐年把水利系统完整起来
    一年之内把所有的渠道修得很长，也是不可能的；把所有的堰塘都修得很好，也是做不到的。应该逐年把“西瓜秧”式的水利系统完整起来。也就是说，瓜秧越长越长，西瓜越结越多，西瓜越长越大。这就是说，要逐年进行“六加”：即加固、加宽、加长、加塘（库）、加绿化、加田。这就是由不完整到完整、由小网到大网的一个发展过程。
        五、边修水利、边蓄水、边改田
    边修、边蓄、边改田，就是做到边修边收益。“渠成、水流、堰满、鱼游、树成林”，就是群众的愿望。群众不但要求收益大，而且还要求快。
    为了达到这个目的，我们改田也必须是根据地形，本着费工少、改田多的原则，随弯就弯，随圆就圆，随方就方。开始多改小块，随地势改成月亮形、葫芦形、喇叭形、长方形、草帽形等均可。只要符合费工少、多改田、收益快的原则就行。然后我们再逐年整理，由小块并大块；不要一开始就想图好看，改大田，劳力调配不过来。改田的任务就会落空。
    为了保证完成改田任务，必须全面安排，分期改田。一部分是先改田后修水利；另一部分是边修边改，留下小部分修了以后再改。过去我们改田，由于没有全面安排，多是集中在兴修水利以后，割麦、插秧大忙的时候才改田。那个时候是割麦插秧两头忙，人畜都忙不过来，还能顾得上改田吗？！虽然修了水利，还是不能很快收益。
    我们现在就注意在秋收后、种麦前改一大部分。这个时候劳力比较充裕，对改田非常有利；结合秋耕整地就把田改好了，改好田以后再种麦子，对麦季增产也没有影响；秋天做的田埂经过一冬一春雨淋日晒，也就会更结实一些；这样还可以使冬季集中全力兴修水利。在冬季兴修水利当中，还可以把一些荒坡、沙滩、闲地改成水田。这样就能尽量避免冬季把麦苗毁掉改田，这样才能达到保修、保蓄水、保改田、保插秧、保增产的目的。
  认真贯彻执行依靠群众勤俭办水利的方针
    为了确保兴修水利运动的健康发展，形成一个群众性的兴修水利的运动，必须进一步贯彻执行合作社自修自管自用和民办公助的勤俭办水利的方针，解决好社与社之间的自愿互利问题。
    我们过去犯过只是伸手向政府要钱，只是想办大型的错误，形成了“国家修塘，群众帮忙”。这样花钱多、受益少，而且不能开展群众性的兴修水利运动。1956年我们全专区旱改水才四十万亩，国家就投资七百五十万元。1957年由于贯彻执行了中央勤俭办水利的方针，依靠群众兴修水利，全区旱改水五百万亩，比1956年工程大了十二倍，国家才投资五百七十四万元。
    所谓自修自管自用，就是：修不修？修多少？在哪里修？修了有什么好处？花多少钱？都要让群众民主讨论，把兴修水利当做他们自己的事情，做到工程公开，财务公开。兴修水利所需要的资金，由社自筹自用，如果需要贷款，也要经过社员大会讨论。只有群众把兴修水利当成自己的事情，群众才能自觉的贯彻执行勤俭办水利的方针。光化县1955年由政府投资在仙人渡乡胡家洼修了一个水库，花了三万五千块钱，只灌了三百亩田，1957年这个县幸福社群众自己修了一个同样工程，也是灌三百亩田，合作社只花了三元八角的灯油钱。由于群众认为兴修水利是自己的事，就是必要花的钱，经过群众讨论，也不愿向政府多贷款了。如随县马鞍山水库，需要三十万块钱，完全是由群众自筹出来的。兴修水利所需要的器材工具，也要依靠群众就地取材，自采、自造、自用；小家具由社员自带；家具需要修理时，也要尽量组织本社的铁匠、木匠、篦匠等去做，按照只记工分不花钱的原则，尽量做到花钱少、受益大、收效快的目的。
        水利高潮带来了全面生产高潮
      “水利是农业的命脉”。随着旱改水，一系列的情况也随着变了，就是说，水利高潮带来了全面的生产高潮。首先带来的是粮、棉、油的生产高潮，因为旱地改水田，低产能变成高产。去冬今春我们共完成水利工程十三万处，修了一百二十五条百里以上的长渠，所有渠道的全长达十三万华里。今年全专区的旱改水由三百万亩改到六百一十三万亩，增加一倍。今年我们的粮食也可以由去年四十亿斤增加到一百三十五点七亿斤，增加两倍多，棉花和油料也来了个大增产。棉花增加三倍，油料增加两倍。旱改水以后，既能防旱又能排涝，又调剂了劳力，晴雨都有活干，水旱都能增产。
    由于粮食的增产，牛有草，猪、鸡、鸭都有糠了，塘里也能养鱼了。也就来了个猪、牛、鸡、鸭、鱼大发展。
    有了水，还利用水力推磨、轧花、造纸、打油等，搞水利加工，节省了大批劳动力。
    特别是山区，随着粮食单位面积产量的提高，群众不缺口粮了，一部分陡坡薄地还可以“废地为林”，我们植树造林、发展多种经营的工作就大大地发展起来。因为有了水，树不但容易活，而且也长的更快了。
    随着粮食与多种经济的全面发展，群众就进一步要求修路，发展交通网，要求汽车、马车、胶轮人力车和木轮人力车……等等。
    同时群众也迫切的要求各种工具的改良，双铧犁、改良犁、条播器、三齿耘锄、收割机、脱粒机和龙骨水车、解放水车、抽水机、拖拉机、缝纫机等等。随着也带来了工业的高潮。
    粮食增了产，人也要求识字和讲卫生了，文化卫生高潮也就来了。
    为了提早实现党中央所提出的全国农业发展纲要的要求，我们计划今冬明春的水利建设，打算在原有的基础上，以扩建为主，结合兴建大中型骨干工程，采取大工程与小工程相结合，兴修与改田相结合，自流灌溉与提水灌溉相结合，水利与加工发电相结合，建成一个完整的水利自流灌溉网，实现水利合作化，旱地水浇化，灌溉自流化，水力加工发电自动化，坡地梯田梯地化，荒山都绿化。要比去冬今春工程大一倍，仅十万亩以上的工程即有三十处，可改田四百万亩。要求全区蓄水量在今年二十五亿公方的基础上，再增加三十八亿公方，共达到六十三亿公方，灌溉面积达到一千五百万亩，这样每次降雨二百公厘也可以全部关起来。那时水旱灾害就可以基本解决，使河水在所有的山头上流下来，灌溉我们所有的田亩。正如群众所说的“过去是水见山低头，现在是山见水低头”，“过去是水治人，现在变成人治水了”。
    我们今后的远景，不仅是彻底消灭水旱灾害，做到粮食增产大丰收，利用水来进行各种加工，而且还要利用水来发电，利用它来进行各项建设，为建立一个美好的幸福的社会主义新农村来努力。正如省委二次党代表会所指出的，虽然我们的工作在党中央正确领导下取得了伟大的成绩，但是与我们今后未完成的事业比较起来，那就相差太远了。所以，任何骄傲自满情绪都是不对的。让我们兢兢业业，继续前进，来完成我们未完成的事业吧。（附图片）
