    Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, New York Dispatch: According to newspaper reports, the Cuban rebel army led by Castro has achieved significant victories in battles against the dictator Batista's troops. Out of the six provinces in the country, the rebel army controls vast areas of three provinces, namely Oriente Province, Las Villas Province, and Matanzas Province, and has virtually taken control of the situation there. According to a report by United Press International from Havana, the rebel army has surrounded Santiago, the largest city in Oriente Province, and telegraph and telephone communications between the city and the outside world have been interrupted since the 17th.
    Not long ago, the Cuban rebel army also occupied some enterprises belonging to American companies, including the Nicaro plant located on the northern coast of Cuba, in Nicaro, Oriente Province. According to a "New York Times" reporter, this factory is continuing production under the supervision of the rebel army.
    The victory of the Cuban rebel movement has greatly shocked the U.S. State Department. Using the pretext of "protecting American property and American citizens," the U.S. State Department issued a special statement that is, in effect, a threat to "take measures" to deal with the rebel army. As can be seen from the news published in newspapers, this statement can only be regarded as an indication of the United States' attempt to interfere in Cuban internal affairs and support the Batista dictatorship in suppressing the rebel movement. According to a report by United Press International, under the guise of evacuating its citizens, the United States also dispatched a fast attack transport ship to Nicaro, on the northeast coast of Cuba, on the evening of the 23rd.

    古巴起义军控制地区扩大
    美国又找借口企图干涉古巴内政
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：据报纸报道，古巴卡斯特罗领导的起义军在同独裁者巴蒂斯塔军队的战斗中取得了重大胜利。在全国六个省份中，起义军控制了奥连特省、拉斯维利亚斯省和马坦萨斯省等三个省的广大地区，并且实际上已经控制了那里的局势。另据合众国际社自哈瓦那报道，起义军已经包围了奥连特省最大的城市圣地亚哥，从17日起这个城市同外界的电报电话联系已经中断。
    不久以前古巴起义军还占领了一些属于美国公司的企业，其中包括位于古巴北部海岸、在奥连特省尼凯罗城的尼凯尔工厂。据“纽约时报”记者说，这个工厂在起义军的监督下在继续进行生产。
    古巴起义运动的胜利使美国国务院大为震惊，美国国务院借口
  “保护美国财产和美国公民”发表了一项特别声明，声明实际上是威胁要“采取措施”来对付起义军。从报纸发表的消息可以看出，这篇声明只能被看成是美国企图干涉古巴内政和支持巴蒂斯塔独裁政权来镇压起义运动的表示。据合众国际社报道，美国在撤退侨民的借口下于23日晚上还派遣了一艘快速进攻运输舰前往古巴东北海岸的尼卡罗。
