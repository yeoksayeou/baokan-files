Reported by this newspaper: Holding high the Party's red flag of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and adapting to the soaring situation of industrial and agricultural production, China's education is developing at a tremendous pace.

Since the implementation of the Party's "part-work, part-study" and the establishment of agricultural middle schools in the spring of this year, the development of education has been greatly promoted. From January to the end of August this year, more than 89 million people were made literate nationwide, more than twice the total number of people made literate in the past eight years. 67.2% of counties and cities nationwide have basically eliminated illiteracy. More than 400,000 new primary schools have been built, with more than 92 million students enrolled. 87.6% of counties and cities nationwide have universal primary education, and the average enrollment rate of school-age children nationwide has reached 93.9%. More than 26,000 new ordinary middle schools have been built, with more than 9.24 million students enrolled. Under the guidance of the Party's "walking on two legs" principle of running schools, local factories, mines, enterprises, rural areas, schools, and government offices have also established various types of spare-time cultural and technical schools and part-work, part-study schools. This is an unprecedented initiative in the history of world education. As of the end of August, more than 64.22 million workers, peasants, and on-the-job cadres were studying in these schools. Now, many factories have established a complete set of spare-time education systems from primary school to university. In rural areas, agricultural middle schools and other vocational middle schools have developed to more than 75,000, with a total of more than 4.22 million students.

Currently, more than 160 million people of school age and above in China are studying in various types of schools at all levels. This number shows that under the leadership of the Communist Party, in just nine short years, a country that originally had about 80% of its population as illiterate or semi-literate has been transformed into a country where on average, less than four people have one person studying in a full-time, part-work, part-study, or spare-time school. This ratio not only creates a miracle unprecedented in history, but it also eloquently refutes the fallacies of some "watchers" and skeptics who believe that the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results cannot be implemented in education.

The speed of development of education in New China is incomparable to the period of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. It has also left the American imperialism, which has always called itself "civilized," far behind. In the nine years since the founding of New China, comparing the number of students enrolled in full-time schools with the time when the country was just liberated in 1949, the number of university students has increased by about six times, the number of secondary school students has increased by about nine times, and the number of primary school students has increased by about four times. According to data recorded in the "American Yearbook" and other materials, in the ten years from 1948 to 1958, the number of students enrolled in schools at all levels in the United States only increased by a little over 7%. "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind." The development of education also proves this truth.

The development of education in China is not only reflected in the increase in quantity, but more importantly, since this spring, due to the implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," and the implementation of the Party's line of "from the masses, to the masses," on the one hand, teachers and students in schools across the country have gone to the countryside and factories and run factories in schools; on the other hand, schools run in factories and rural areas have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, enabling education in China to change the phenomenon of neglecting politics, being divorced from reality, and being divorced from productive labor in the past, breaking through the framework of a few experts running schools, and creating a situation of blooming flowers and flourishing appearances.

In general ordinary schools, since the implementation of part-work, part-study, in addition to playing a great role in transforming the thinking of teachers and students, creating material wealth for the country, and improving the quality of teaching, it has also set off a high tide of scientific research and academic criticism. On the eve of National Day, according to statistics from only eighteen universities, students came up with more than 20,000 scientific research achievements to offer as gifts to the Party, a considerable part of which reached or exceeded international standards.

### 开创教育史上亘古未有的奇迹  自诩为“文明”的美国被我们远远地抛在后面

    开创教育史上亘古未有的奇迹
    自诩为“文明”的美国被我们远远地抛在后面
    本报讯　高举着党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合”的红旗，适应工农生产振翅高飞的形势，我国教育事业正在以一日千里的速度，向前发展。
     各地自今春实现了党提出的“勤工俭学”和开办农业中学两项措施后，大大地推动了教育事业的发展。从今年1月到8月底为止，全国共扫除文盲八千九百多万人，比过去八年中扫除文盲总数还多两倍，全国已有67．2％的县市基本上消灭了文盲；新建小学四十余万所，在校学生达到九千二百多万，全国已有87．6％的县市普及了小学教育，全国学龄儿童入学率平均达到93．9％；新建普通中学二万六千余所，在校学生达到九百二十四万多人。在党的“两条腿走路”的办学原则指导下，各地工矿、企业、农村、学校、机关还兴办了各级各类业余文化技术学校和半工半读学校。这是世界教育史上从来没有的创举。截至8月底为止，全国有六千四百二十二万多工农群众和在职干部在这些学校里学习。现在，不少的工厂已经建立了由小学到高等学校一整套的业余教育体系。在农村里，农业中学和其他职业中学已发展到七万五千多所，在校学生共四百二十二万余人。
    目前，我国学龄儿童以上的人民有一亿六千多万人正在各级各类学校里学习。这个数字说明：在共产党的领导下，只不过短短九年的时间，把一个原来有80％左右人口是文盲或半文盲的国家，变成为平均不到四个人中间，就有一个人在全日制、半工半读或业余学校里学习的国家了。这个比例数字，不但创造了历史上亘古未有的奇迹，它也雄辩地驳斥了一些观潮派和怀疑派认为在教育工作中不能贯彻多快好省社会主义总路线的谬论。
    新中国教育事业发展的速度，是国民党反动统治时期所无法比拟的。它也把向来自诩为“文明”的美帝国主义，远远地抛在后面了。新中国成立九年中，仅以全日制学校在校学生数同1949年全国刚解放时比较，高等学校学生增长了约六倍，中等学校学生增长了约九倍，小学学生增长了约四倍。而据“美国年鉴”等记载的资料，从1948年到1958年的十年中，美国高、中、小各级学校在校学生数，都只增长了7％强。“东风压倒西风”，在教育事业的发展中，也同样证明了这个真理。
    我国教育事业的发展，不仅表现在量的增长，更重要的是，今春以来，由于教育工作中贯彻了党的“教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合”的方针，贯彻了党的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的路线，一方面全国各地学校的师生们纷纷下乡下厂和在学校里办工厂；一方面工厂、农村里兴办的学校像雨后春笋般地发展起来，使我国教育事业改变了过去忽视政治、脱离实际、脱离生产劳动的现象，突破了少数专家办学的框框，出现了一个百花齐放，万象峥嵘的局面。
    在一般普通学校里，自从实行勤工俭学以后，除了对改造师生们的思想起了很大的作用，为国家创造了物质财富，提高了教学质量外，还掀起了科学研究和学术批判的高潮。国庆节前夕，仅据十八所高等学校统计，学生们就拿出两万多项科学研究成就向党献礼，其中，有相当一部分是达到或超过国际水平的。
