The question of how to recognize revolutionary forces and reactionary forces is a major issue both in China and globally. Many people still struggle to resolve this issue. Imperialism and its lackeys in various countries are like the setting sun, while socialism and the national revolutionary movements supported by socialism are like the rising sun. This is the hallmark of our era. The era of imperialist domination is gone forever, and they are on the verge of collapse. It should be the reactionaries who fear the revolutionary forces, not the other way around. However, many people still do not see this. They still have superstitions and illusions, still harbor a sense of awe towards imperialism, especially American imperialism. They are still passive on this issue. All progressive people, all Marxists, and revolutionaries should engage in persuasion work among them, enabling the broad masses to possess revolutionary confidence and determination, revolutionary foresight, and steadfastness. This is an indispensable spiritual condition for accelerating the victory of the revolutionary cause.

Comrade Mao Zedong often reminds us that when observing problems, we must grasp their essence and not be deceived by surface phenomena. Over the past thirty years, at every critical juncture in the domestic class struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong has always made profound judgments about the situation of the struggle based on Marxism-Leninism, pointing out to people that all reactionaries will inevitably perish and the revolutionary cause will inevitably triumph. He uses the term "paper tiger" to describe imperialism and all reactionary forces that appear strong but are actually weak. He uses the idiom "a single spark can start a prairie fire" to describe the new forces growing day by day in the revolutionary cause, and based on this assessment, he plans his strategic plans. Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on the invincibility of revolutionary forces and the inevitable failure of temporarily strong reactionary forces have armed the Chinese Communist Party, educated and inspired the Chinese people, and guided us to achieve great victories. Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant judgment that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers" has already been proven by the victory of the Chinese revolution, and it will continue to be proven by the victory and development of the revolutionary cause in China and the world. Recently, the editorial board of "World Knowledge" magazine compiled and published Comrade Mao Zedong's articles, speeches, and talks on "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." This is a work of great political significance. It is very beneficial for the people's struggle against the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism. Now, we have supplemented some important materials related to it, and made some adjustments in terms of format and paragraphs, and published it here. The entire article is still divided into three parts. The first part discusses that imperialism and all reactionaries representing decadent forces have no future; their temporary rampage is merely a sign of their dying struggle. The second part discusses that imperialism and all reactionaries are externally strong but internally weak; revolutionary people have reason to despise them, but in every specific struggle, they must also take them seriously. The third part discusses the basic characteristics of the current international situation: the East Wind has already overcome the West Wind, and the forces of socialism have surpassed the forces of imperialism. Although most of these articles, speeches, and talks have been published, only a few have not, and the time span between them is as long as twenty years, and they are compiled in a collected form; however, they give the reader the feeling of a new, complete political essay. The reason is that the fundamental contradiction between imperialism and its lackeys on one hand, and the peoples of various countries on the other, has not been resolved. American imperialism is particularly aggressive, threatening world peace with nuclear war, and the oppressed and threatened peoples' thoughts are attracted by this tense situation, urgently demanding a solution to this contradiction. Therefore, readers naturally feel interested in Comrade Mao Zedong's discussions on solving this contradiction, especially the first and primary issue of whether the paper tiger is a paper tiger or not.

In his seminal work "On New Democracy" published in January 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that capitalism has entered a stage of decay and death, while communism is "sweeping across the world with the force of a torrential flood and the momentum of a thunderbolt":

"Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat and at the same time a new social system. This ideological system and social system are distinct from any other ideological system and any other social system, and are the most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational in the history of mankind. The feudal ideological system and social system have become exhibits in the history museum. The capitalist ideological system and social system have already partially entered the museum (in the Soviet Union); the remaining part is also 'setting sun, fading breath, life in danger, not knowing whether it can last until evening,' and is about to enter the museum. Only the communist ideological system and social system are sweeping across the world with the force of a torrential flood and the momentum of a thunderbolt, preserving their beautiful youth."

Comrade Mao Zedong also pointed out in "On New Democracy" that the rampage of all reactionaries representing decadent forces is a sign of their dying struggle:

"The rampage of all internal and external dark forces has caused national disasters; but this rampage not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows that they are in their last struggle, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory. This is the case in China, in the entire East, and in the world."

On June 17, 1945, in his speech at the memorial ceremony for Chinese revolutionary martyrs, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the more reactionary the reactionaries are, the closer they are to annihilation:

"The method of self-criticism can only be used within the people, and it is impossible to hope to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back. The only way is to organize forces to fight against them, such as our people's liberation war, land revolution, exposing imperialism, 'stimulating' them, defeating them, and punishing their criminal behavior, 'allowing them to behave properly and not allowing them to speak or act recklessly.' Then, there is hope to deal with foreign imperialist countries on equal and mutually beneficial terms. Then, there is hope to educate the disarmed and surrendered landlord class elements, bureaucratic capitalist class elements, and elements of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices, and to turn them into good people as much as possible. Many Chinese liberals, that is, old democrats, that is, the supporters of so-called 'democratic individualism' that Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart all hope for and constantly try to win over, often fall into a passive position, and their observations of problems are often incorrect—observations of American rulers are often incorrect, observations of the Kuomintang are often incorrect, observations of the Soviet Union are often incorrect, and observations of the Chinese Communist Party are also often incorrect. This is because they do not or do not approve of using the historical materialist perspective to look at problems.

"Progressive people, Communists, various democratic parties, awakened workers, youth students, progressive intellectuals, have the responsibility to unite the intermediate strata, intermediate factions, backward elements of various strata within the people of China, and all those who are still wavering and hesitating (these people will waver for a long time, become firm and then waver again, and waver at the slightest difficulty). Use kindness to help them, criticize their wavering nature, educate them, and strive to get them to stand on the side of the people, not allowing imperialism to pull them over, making them abandon illusions and prepare for struggle. Do not think that victory means no more work needs to be done. More work, more patient work, is needed to truly win these people over. Once won over, imperialism will be completely isolated, and Acheson's tricks will have no place to be applied."

On October 12, 1942, in an editorial for the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an titled "The Turning Point of the Second World War," Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the essence of reactionary forces being externally strong but internally weak, reminding revolutionary people not to be deceived by surface phenomena. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

"In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary force, and some revolutionaries are often deceived by this phenomenon of external strength but internal weakness for a period, failing to see that the enemy is about to be destroyed and they are about to win. The rise of the entire fascist force and its several years of aggressive war is a manifestation of this final struggle; and in the war, the attack on Stalingrad is a manifestation of its final struggle. In the face of this historical turning point, many people within the global anti-fascist front are also deceived by the ferocious face of fascism, failing to see its essence."

Reactionaries always boast about their seemingly powerful military force. Among the people, there is also a part that has varying degrees of fear towards the military power of reactionaries. This is the view of "weaponism." In his famous essay "On Protracted War" written in May 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound criticism of this view:

"The so-called 'weaponism' is mechanicism in the problem of war, a view that looks at problems subjectively and one-sidedly. Our view is the opposite; we not only see weapons but also see manpower. Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is man, not matter. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of manpower and morale. Military and economic strength must be grasped by people."

In August 1946, Comrade Mao Zedong met with American journalist Anna Louise Strong in Yan'an and made his famous statement that all reactionaries are paper tigers. Below is the full text of this conversation:

"Q: Do you think there is any hope for a political or peaceful solution to China's problems in the near future?
"A: That depends on the attitude of the American government. If the American people restrain the American reactionaries who are helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war, then peace is possible.

"Q: If America does not provide any more help beyond what it has already given, how long can Chiang Kai-shek fight?
"A: More than a year.

"Q: Can Chiang Kai-shek support himself economically for that long?
"A: Yes.

"Q: What if America declares that it will not provide any more help to Chiang Kai-shek?
"A: At present, there is no sign that the American government and Chiang Kai-shek have any intention to stop the war in the short term.

"Q: How long can the Communist Party support itself?
"A: As for our own wishes, we do not want to fight even for a day. But if the situation forces us to fight, we can fight to the end.

"Q: If the American people ask why the Communist Party is fighting, what should I say?
"A: Because Chiang Kai-shek wants to massacre the Chinese people, and the people must defend themselves to survive. This is something that Americans can understand.

"Q: What is your view on whether America might launch an anti-Soviet war?
"A: The propaganda about an anti-Soviet war includes two aspects. On one hand, American imperialism is indeed preparing for an anti-Soviet war, and the current anti-Soviet war propaganda and other anti-Soviet propaganda are political preparations for an anti-Soviet war; on the other hand, this propaganda is a smokescreen used by American reactionaries to cover up the many actual contradictions they are directly facing. These contradictions are the contradictions between American reactionaries and the American people, as well as the contradictions between American imperialism and other capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries. The slogan of an anti-Soviet war by the American reactionaries is currently aimed at oppressing the American people and expanding their aggressive forces to the capitalist world. You know, Hitler and his partner, the Japanese militarists, used the anti-Soviet slogan for a long time to enslave their own people and invade other countries, and now the American reactionaries are doing the same.

"The American reactionaries want to instigate war, and they must first attack the American people. They are already attacking the American people, oppressing American workers and democrats politically and economically, preparing to implement fascism in America. The American people should rise up to resist the attacks of the American reactionaries. I believe they will do so.

"America and the Soviet Union are separated by an extremely vast area, where there are many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The American reactionaries cannot talk about attacking the Soviet Union before they have subdued these countries. Now, America controls more places in the Pacific than the entire sphere of influence that Britain once had; it controls Japan, the Kuomintang-ruled China, half of Korea, and the South Pacific; it has long controlled Central and South America; it still wants to control the entire British Empire and Western Europe. Under various pretexts, America is making large-scale military deployments in many countries, establishing military bases. The American reactionaries say that all the naval bases they have established and are preparing to establish around the world are for opposing the Soviet Union. Indeed, these military bases are aimed at the Soviet Union. However, at present, the first to suffer from American aggression is not the Soviet Union, but these countries where military bases are established. I believe that it will not be long before these countries realize who is truly oppressing them, the Soviet Union or America. The American reactionaries will one day find themselves in the opposition of the people of the world.

"Of course, I am not saying that the American reactionaries do not want to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the defender of world peace and a powerful factor hindering the American reactionaries from establishing world hegemony. With the Soviet Union, the ambitions of American and world reactionaries cannot be realized at all; therefore, the American reactionaries hate the Soviet Union very much and indeed dream of destroying this socialist country. However, at present, shortly after the end of the Second World War, the American reactionaries are making such a big fuss about the Sino-American war, creating such a chaotic situation, that one cannot help but look at their actual purposes. It turns out that they are using the anti-Soviet slogan to crazily attack American workers and democrats and turn all the target countries of American expansion into American satellites. I think the American people and the people of all countries threatened by American aggression should unite to oppose the attacks of American reactionaries and their lackeys in various countries. Only when this struggle is won can the third world war be avoided; otherwise, it cannot be avoided.

"Q: This is a good explanation. But what if America uses the atomic bomb? What if America bombs the Soviet Union from bases in Iceland, Okinawa, and China?
"A: The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by American reactionaries to scare people, looking scary but actually not scary. Of course, the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but the decisive factor in winning or losing a war is the people, not one or two new weapons.

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. Looking at it, the reactionaries seem scary, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people. Before the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, which side in Russia had the real power? On the surface, the tsar seemed to have power; but a gust of wind from the February Revolution blew the tsar away. In the end, the power in Russia lay with the workers, peasants, and soldiers' soviets. The tsar was just a paper tiger. Wasn't Hitler once considered very powerful? But history has proven that he was a paper tiger. Mussolini was the same, and so was Japanese imperialism. On the contrary, the power of the Soviet Union and the people of various countries who love democracy and freedom was much stronger than people had expected.

"Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters, the American reactionaries, are also paper tigers. When people talk about American imperialism, it seems so powerful, and the Chinese reactionaries are using America's 'strength' to frighten the Chinese people. But the American reactionaries will also be proven, like all reactionaries in history, to have no real power. In America, there is another class of people who are truly powerful, and that is the American people.

"Taking the situation in China as an example, what we rely on is nothing more than millet and rifles, but history will ultimately prove that this millet and rifles are stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's airplanes and tanks. Although there are still many difficulties facing the Chinese people, the Chinese people will suffer long-term hardships under the combined attacks of American imperialism and Chinese reactionaries, but these reactionaries will one day fail, and we will one day win. The reason is not that the reactionaries represent progress, but we represent progress."

On December 25, 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong gave a report titled "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. In this report, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"The Chinese Communist Party, based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, has a clear understanding of the international and domestic situation, knowing that the attacks of all internal and external reactionaries are not only necessary to be defeated but also can be defeated. When the sky seems dark, we pointed out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, the storm will soon pass, and dawn is ahead. When, in July 1946, the Kuomintang bandits launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary war, the Kuomintang bandits thought that they could defeat the People's Liberation Army in just three to six months. They thought they had 2 million regular troops, 1 million irregular troops, 1 million military organizations and troops in the rear, totaling more than 4 million military forces; they had used time to complete their preparations for the attack; they had regained control of the major cities; they had a population of more than 300 million; they had seized the entire equipment of the 1 million Japanese troops that invaded China; they had obtained significant military and financial aid from the American government. They also thought that the People's Liberation Army was very tired after eight years of anti-Japanese war and was far inferior to the Kuomintang army in numbers and equipment; the liberated areas still had only about 100 million people (editor's note: the population census at that time was not accurate, and it was generally believed that the country had only 450 million people, and after liberation, an accurate census showed that China had 600 million people), and in most of these areas, the reactionary feudal forces had not been eliminated, land reform was not universal and thorough, and the rear of the People's Liberation Army was not secure. Based on these foundations, the Kuomintang bandits, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the Chinese people, finally tore up the ceasefire agreement signed between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in January 1946 and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference of all parties, launched an adventurous war. At that time, we said that the enemy's military superiority was only a temporary phenomenon, only a temporarily effective factor; American imperialist aid was also only a temporarily effective factor; while the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war, the support of the people, was a constantly effective factor; and in this regard, the People's Liberation Army had the advantage. The just, patriotic, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war must gain the support of the people of the whole country. This is the political basis for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. Eighteen months of war experience fully proved our judgment.

"When the Kuomintang reactionary clique launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary war against the people in 1946, they dared to take risks not only because they relied on their own superior military forces but mainly because they thought that the extremely powerful, invincible American imperialism, which held atomic bombs in its hands, would supply them with military and financial needs like flowing water; on the other hand, they arrogantly imagined the so-called 'inevitable outbreak of the third world war.' This reliance on American imperialism is a common feature of all reactionary forces in the world after the end of the Second World War. This reflects the seriousness of the blow dealt to world capitalism by the Second World War, the weakness of the reactionary forces in various countries and their psychological panic and loss of confidence, and the strength of the revolutionary forces in the world, making the reactionaries in various countries feel that they have no way out except to rely on the aid of American imperialism. But in reality, after the Second World War, is American imperialism as powerful as Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries in various countries imagined? Can it really supply Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries in various countries like flowing water? It is not so. The economic strength of American imperialism, which was enhanced during the Second World War, encountered an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. Further shrinkage of this market would lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis. The war boom of America is only a temporary phenomenon. Its strength is only superficial and temporary. The crisis is like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This situation forces American imperialists to establish a plan to enslave the world, like a beast, rampaging through Europe, Asia, and other places, gathering the reactionary forces of various countries, those dregs despised by the people, forming an imperialist and anti-democratic camp to oppose all democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, preparing for war, and attempting to defeat the democratic forces in the future, at some distant time, by launching a third world war. This is an arrogant plan. The democratic forces of the world must defeat this plan and are completely capable of doing so. The strength of the anti-imperialist camp in the world exceeds the strength of the imperialist camp. The advantage is on our side, not on the enemy's side."

On January 18, 1948, in an instruction to the party titled "On Several Important Issues in the Current Party Policy" written by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong told us that in general, strategically, we should despise the enemy, but at the same time, we should also pay attention to the art of struggle, and in every specific struggle, we should take the enemy seriously:

"Oppose the overestimation of the enemy's strength. For example, fearing American imperialism, fearing to fight in the Kuomintang areas, fearing to overthrow the comprador feudal system, distribute land to landlords, and confiscate bureaucratic capital, fearing a long war, etc. These are all incorrect. The rule of capitalism in the world and the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique in China have already rotted and have no future. We have reason to despise them. We have the confidence and determination to defeat all internal and external enemies of the Chinese people. However, in every specific struggle (whether in military, political, economic, or ideological struggles), we must never despise the enemy, but rather, we must take the enemy seriously, concentrate all our strength to fight, and only then can we achieve victory. When we correctly point out that in general, strategically, we should despise the enemy, we must never despise the enemy in every specific struggle. If we overestimate the enemy's strength in general, we will not dare to overthrow them, not dare to win, and we will commit the right-opportunist error. If we do not adopt a cautious attitude in every specific struggle, do not pay attention to the art of struggle, do not concentrate all our strength to fight, do not pay attention to winning over all the allies we should win over (middle peasants, independent industrialists and merchants, the middle class, students, teachers, professors, and general intellectuals, general public servants, freelancers, and enlightened gentry), we will commit the 'left'-opportunist error."

On November 18, 1957, in his speech at the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in Moscow, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"When Chiang Kai-shek started attacking us in 1946, many of our comrades, the entire nation, were very worried: could the war be won? I was also worried about this. But we had one confidence. At that time, an American journalist came to Yan'an, named Anna Louise Strong. When I talked to her, I talked about many issues, Chiang Kai-shek, Hitler, Japan, America, the atomic bomb, etc. I said all the so-called powerful reactionaries are just paper tigers. The reason is that they are detached from the people. Look, wasn't Hitler a paper tiger? Wasn't Hitler defeated? I also talked about the tsar being a paper tiger, the Chinese emperor being a paper tiger, Japanese imperialism being a paper tiger. Look, they have all fallen. American imperialism has not fallen yet, and it still has the atomic bomb. I think it will also fall, it is also a paper tiger. Chiang Kai-shek was very powerful, with more than 400,000 regular troops. At that time, we were in Yan'an. How many people were in Yan'an? There were 7,000 people. How many troops did we have? We had 900,000 guerrillas, all divided into dozens of base areas by Chiang Kai-shek. But we said, Chiang Kai-shek is just a paper tiger, and we will definitely defeat him. To fight against the enemy, we formed a concept over a long period: that is, strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must take all enemies seriously. That is, in general, we must despise them, and in specific issues, we must take them seriously. If we do not despise the enemy in general, we will commit the opportunist error. Marx and Engels, just the two of them, said at that time that world capitalism would be overthrown. But in specific issues, in the issue of each enemy, if we do not take them seriously, we will commit the adventurist error. Battles can only be fought one by one, enemies can only be destroyed one by one. Factories can only be built one by one, peasants plowing fields can only plow one by one, and even eating is the same. We despise eating strategically: we can eat this meal. But eating specifically is one mouthful at a time; you cannot swallow a whole banquet in one mouthful. This is called solving one by one, and in military terms, it is called annihilating one by one."

On November 18, 1957, in his speech at the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in Moscow, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the current international situation, pointing out that the current situation is that the forces of socialism have surpassed the forces of imperialism, and the East Wind has overcome the West Wind:

"I think the current international situation has reached a new turning point. There are now two winds in the world: the East Wind and the West Wind. There is a Chinese saying: 'It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind.' I think the current situation is characterized by the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, that is, the forces of socialism have a decisive advantage over the forces of imperialism."

The day before this speech, on November 17, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech to Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union:

"The direction of the world has changed. The struggle between the socialist camp and the capitalist camp is either the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind or the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. Now, the world has a total population of 2.7 billion. The population of socialist countries is nearly 1 billion, the population of newly independent former colonial countries is more than 700 million, the population of countries struggling for independence or complete independence and capitalist countries with a tendency towards neutrality is 600 million, and the population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million, and their internal divisions are severe. There will be an 'earthquake' there. Now, it is not the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, but the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind."

On November 6, 1957, in his speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"Imperialism, in addition to relying on the oppression of its domestic people and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, also hopes for war. But what can they hope for from war? In the past half-century, we have experienced two world wars. After the first world war, the great October Socialist Revolution appeared in Russia. After the second world war, more revolutions appeared in Eastern Europe and the East. If the imperialist gentlemen decide to launch a third world war, they will not achieve anything other than accelerating the fundamental collapse of the world capitalist system."

On February 27, 1957, in his speech at the 11th Enlarged Meeting of the State Council, Comrade Mao Zedong discussed "The Question of Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People." In the tenth part of this speech, "Can Bad Things Turn Into Good Things?", he said:

"Now, people all over the world are talking about whether there will be a third world war. We must also be spiritually prepared and analyze this issue. We are firmly committed to peace and against war. However, if imperialism insists on launching a war, we should not be afraid. Our attitude towards this issue is the same as our attitude towards all 'troubles': first, oppose; second, do not fear. After the first world war, a Soviet Union with 200 million people emerged. After the second world war, a socialist camp with a total of 900 million people emerged. If imperialists insist on launching a third world war, it can be predicted that the result will be that more billions of people will turn to socialism, and the remaining territory of imperialism will not be much, and it is even possible that the entire imperialist system will completely collapse.

"The opposing and contradictory dual forces, through mutual struggle, will inevitably transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling dual forces will not transform. The class in the world that is most willing to change its position is the proletariat, followed by the semi-proletariat, because one has nothing, and the other has little. Now, the situation where the United States controls the majority of votes in the United Nations and controls many places in the world is only temporary. This situation will change one day. China's status as a poor country and its powerlessness in international affairs will also change; poor countries will become rich countries, and powerlessness will become powerful—transforming in the opposite direction. Here, the decisive condition is the socialist system and the unity and struggle of the people."

On June 28, 1950, when American imperialism openly launched an invasion of Korea and armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech at the 8th meeting of the Central People's Government Council:

"The Chinese people have already declared that the affairs of all countries in the world should be handled by the people of those countries themselves, and the affairs of Asia should be handled by the Asian people themselves, not by the United States. American aggression in Asia can only arouse widespread and resolute resistance from the Asian people. Truman declared on January 5 of this year that America would not interfere in Taiwan, but now he has proven that it is false, and at the same time, he has torn up all international agreements that the United States would not interfere in China's internal affairs. America has thus exposed its imperialist face, which is beneficial to China and the Asian people. American interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc., is completely unreasonable, and the sympathy of all Chinese people and the broad masses of people around the world will stand with the invaded, and will never stand with American imperialism. They will neither be tempted by imperialist benefits nor fear imperialist threats. Imperialism is externally strong but internally weak because it lacks the support of the people. The people of the country and the people of the world should unite, make adequate preparations, and defeat any provocation by American imperialism."

On February 14, 1955, in his speech at the reception held by the Soviet Embassy in China to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:

"Under the cooperation of our two great countries, I believe that the imperialist plan of aggression will be shattered.

"We can all see that under the great cooperation of our two countries, all imperialist plans of aggression will be shattered. They will definitely be thoroughly shattered. As long as imperialism launches an aggressive war, we and the people of the world will definitely wipe them off the face of the earth!"

On September 8, 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong said at a meeting of the State Council:

"The current situation is favorable to the people of the world who are striving for peace.

"The overall trend is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind.

"American imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for nine years and recently sent its armed forces to occupy Lebanon. America has established hundreds of military bases in many countries around the world. Taiwan, Lebanon, and all American military bases abroad are nooses around the neck of American imperialism. It is not others but the Americans themselves who made these nooses and put them around their own necks, while handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the Arab people, and all the people of the world who love peace and oppose aggression. The longer the American aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their neck will be."

On September 29, 1958, after inspecting several provinces along the Yangtze River, Comrade Mao Zedong returned to Beijing and said in his conversation with Xinhua News Agency reporters:

"The lifespan of imperialists will not be long, because they do nothing but evil, supporting the reactionaries of various countries who oppress the people, occupying large amounts of colonial, semi-colonial, and military bases, and threatening peace with nuclear war. In this way, they force more than 90% of the world's population to either already or soon rise up against them. However, imperialists are still alive, and they are still rampaging in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are still oppressing the people in the Western world. This situation must change. Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism, is the task of the people of the world."

"All reactionaries' attempts are to use slaughter to eliminate the revolution. They think the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. However, contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force will be, and the closer the reactionaries will be to annihilation. This is an irresistible law."

On November 6, 1957, in his speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how reactionaries try to stop the forward march of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably win. 'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries in various countries are also such a group of foolish people. The various persecutions they inflict on revolutionary people will ultimately only promote a broader and more intense revolution. Didn't the persecutions of the tsar and Chiang Kai-shek on revolutionary people play such a promotional role in the great Russian revolution and the great Chinese revolution?"

On February 20, 1940, in his speech at the Constitutional Promotion Association in Yan'an titled "New Democratic Constitutionalism," Comrade Mao Zedong exposed Chiang Kai-shek's deceptive propaganda of implementing constitutionalism and explained that the result of the reactionaries is always the opposite of their wishes.

Title: Mao Zedong's Views on the Inevitable Downfall of Reactionaries and the Victory of Revolution

The obstinate elements of the world, though they may be obstinate today, tomorrow, and the day after, cannot remain obstinate forever. Eventually, they will change. For example, Wang Jingwei was obstinate for a long time but could no longer be obstinate in the anti-Japanese base and had to flee to Japan. Another example is Zhang Guotao, who was also obstinate for a long time. After we held a few struggle meetings, the seventh and eighth, he fled. In reality, obstinate elements are obstinate but not firm. Eventually, they will change, turning into something despised by humanity, a pile of filth. There are also those who change for the better, also due to struggle. After the seventh and eighth struggles, they realize their mistakes and change for the better. In summary, the obstinate faction will undergo changes. The obstinate faction always has a plan, which is about how to harm others for personal gain and how to play both sides. However, all reactionaries throughout history have ended up with results opposite to their wishes. They always start by harming others and end up harming themselves. We have said that Chamberlain "picked up a stone to hit his own foot," which has now come true. Chamberlain's sole intention was to pick up Hitler's stone to hit the feet of the Soviet people, but since September of last year, when the war between Germany and the Anglo-French alliance broke out, the stone in Chamberlain's hand hit his own foot. To this day, this stone is still hitting Chamberlain. There are many such stories in China. Yuan Shikai wanted to hit the feet of the common people, but he ended up hitting himself and died after a few months as an emperor. Duan Qirui, Xu Shichang, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, and others all wanted to suppress the people, but they all ended up being overthrown by the people. Those who have the heart to harm others for personal gain will not end up well.

On April 24, 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a famous political report titled "On Coalition Government" at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In the "Our Specific Program" section of this report, Comrade Mao Zedong warned the Kuomintang reactionaries about their attempt to use the "National Assembly" to carry out anti-people conspiracies and predicted that implementing this reactionary policy would be "preparing a noose to hang around their own necks," pushing themselves to the brink of destruction. Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"The steps that our anti-people heroes are preparing to take based on this divisive policy have the danger of pushing themselves to the brink of destruction. They are preparing to put a noose around their own necks and make sure it can never be untied. This noose is called the 'National Assembly.' Their original intention was to use this so-called 'National Assembly' as a talisman, to resist the coalition government, maintain dictatorial rule, and prepare reasons for civil war. However, the logic of history will go in the opposite direction of their intentions, 'picking up a stone to hit their own feet.'"

On July 12, 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote an article titled "Evaluating the Danger of the Hurley Policy" for Xinhua News Agency, pointing out that the U.S. policy towards China had created a crisis of civil war and warning that this policy of the U.S. government and people, which is hostile to the Chinese people, would bring them "endless troubles":

"In the same mouth of Hurley, the Kuomintang government represented by Chiang Kai-shek became a beauty, while the Communist Party became a monster; and he bluntly declared: the United States only cooperates with Chiang Kai-shek and does not cooperate with the Communist Party. Of course, this is not just Hurley's personal opinion, but the opinion of a group of people in the U.S. government, but it is a wrong and dangerous opinion. ... If the Hurley policy continues, the U.S. government will be stuck in the stinking and deep cesspool of the Chinese reactionaries and will not be able to get out, putting itself in the opposing position of the awakened and continuously awakening hundreds of millions of Chinese people, currently hindering the anti-Japanese war, and in the future, hindering world peace. ... It can be said with certainty that the policy of supporting the anti-people forces in China and making such a vast number of Chinese people enemies, if this Hurley-style policy continues unchanged, will bring a heavy burden and endless troubles to the U.S. government and people, and this must be made clear to the American people."

In his closing speech titled "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China on June 11, 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"The U.S. government's policy of supporting Chiang and opposing communism shows the arrogance of the U.S. reactionaries. However, all the attempts of domestic and foreign reactionaries to stop the victory of the Chinese people are doomed to fail. The current world trend is that democracy is the mainstream, and anti-democratic reaction is just a countercurrent. Currently, the reactionary countercurrent is trying to overwhelm the mainstream of national independence and people's democracy, but the reactionary countercurrent will never become the mainstream."

Reactionaries are bound to fall, and revolution is bound to win. In his closing speech at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong called on the people to establish a belief in the inevitability of revolutionary victory. He used the ancient Chinese fable "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to illustrate that as long as revolutionaries have faith, are not afraid of reactionaries, have determination, and persist in struggling to the end, revolution is bound to win:

"We promote the line of the congress, which is to make the entire party and the people of the whole country establish a belief that revolution is bound to win. First, we must make the vanguard aware, make a firm decision, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory. But this is not enough; we must also make the broad masses of the Chinese people aware and willing to struggle with us to strive for victory. We must make the people of the whole country have such a belief: China belongs to the Chinese people, not to the reactionaries. There is an ancient Chinese fable called 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains.' It tells of an old man named Yugong who lived in northern China. In front of his house, there were two mountains blocking his way out, one called Taihang Mountain and the other called Wangwu Mountain. Yugong decided to lead his sons to dig away these two mountains with a hoe. An old man named Zhisou saw this and laughed, saying that you are being foolish to think that you and your sons can dig away such two mountains. Yugong replied: I will die, and my sons will live; my sons will die, and my grandsons will live; the generations are endless. These two mountains, though high, will not grow any higher, but digging away a little will make them a little less, so why can't they be leveled? Yugong refuted Zhisou's wrong thinking and remained undeterred, digging the mountains every day without stopping. This moved the gods, who then sent two immortals to carry away the two mountains. Now there are also two mountains pressing down on the Chinese people, one called imperialism and the other called feudalism. The Communist Party of China has long decided to dig away these two mountains. We must persist, we must work unceasingly, and we will also move the gods. This god is not someone else but the masses of the Chinese people. The masses of the people of the whole country rise up and dig these two mountains with us, what can't be leveled?"

On August 11, 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote an article titled "Evaluating the White Paper" for Xinhua News Agency, providing a profound analysis of the extremely different development logic of reactionary forces and people's forces; and pointed out that advanced people must organize forces to struggle against reactionaries, educate, unite, and win over all those who are still wavering and hesitant, making reactionaries completely isolated:

"The logic of imperialists and the logic of the people are so different. Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail more, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world, and they will never deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature cannot be changed; imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their destruction.

Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—that is the logic of the people, and they will never deviate from this logic. This is another Marxist law. The Russian people's revolution once followed this law, and the Chinese people's revolution also follows this law.

Class struggle, some classes win, some classes perish—that is history, that is the history of civilization for thousands of years. To explain history from this point of view is called historical materialism, and to stand on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism.

The method of self-criticism can only be used within the people, hoping to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back is impossible. The only way is to organize forces to struggle against them, such as our people's liberation war, land revolution, exposing imperialism, 'stimulating' them, overthrowing them, and punishing their criminal behavior, 'allowing them to behave properly and not allowing them to make trouble.' Then, there is hope to deal with foreign imperialist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Then, there is hope to educate the disarmed and surrendered landlord class members, bureaucratic capitalist class members, and Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices, and to transform them into good people as much as possible. Many liberalists in China, that is, old democrats, that is, the so-called supporters of 'democratic individualism' that Truman, Marshall, Acheson, and Stuart expect and often try to win over, often fall into a passive position, and their observations of problems are often incorrect—observations of American rulers are often incorrect, observations of the Kuomintang are often incorrect, observations of the Soviet Union are often incorrect, and observations of the Communist Party of China are also often incorrect, all because they do not or do not approve of using the point of view of historical materialism to look at problems.

Advanced people, Communists, various democratic parties, awakened workers, young students, progressive intellectuals, have the responsibility to unite the intermediate classes, intermediate factions, backward elements of various classes, and all those who are still wavering and hesitating within the people of China (these people will long be wavering, firming up and then wavering, wavering at the slightest difficulty), to help them with goodwill, criticize their wavering nature, educate them, and win them over to stand on the side of the masses of the people, not allowing imperialism to pull them over, making them abandon illusions and prepare for struggle. Do not think that victory has been achieved and there is no need to do work. There is still much work to be done, much patient work, to truly win these people. Once these people are won over, imperialism will be completely isolated, and Acheson's tricks will have no place to apply."

On October 12, 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote an editorial for the "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an titled "The Turning Point of the Second World War," analyzing the essence of reactionary forces being strong on the outside but weak on the inside, reminding revolutionaries not to be deceived by surface phenomena. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

"In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggle against revolutionary forces, and some revolutionaries are often deceived by this strong but weak phenomenon for a period, not seeing that the enemy is about to be destroyed and they are about to win. The rise of the entire fascist force and its several years of aggressive war is a manifestation of this final struggle; and in the war, the attack on Stalingrad is the manifestation of its final struggle. In front of this historical turning point, many people within the anti-fascist front were also deceived by the ferocious face of fascism, not seeing its essence."

Reactionaries always boast about their seemingly powerful military. Among the people, there is also a part that has different degrees of fear of the military power of reactionaries. This is the view of "weaponism." In his famous article "On Protracted War" written in May 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound critique of this view:

"The so-called 'weaponism' is mechanicism in the problem of war, a subjective and one-sided view of the problem. Our view is the opposite; we not only see weapons but also see manpower. Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is man, not matter. The comparison of strength is not only a comparison of military and economic strength but also a comparison of manpower and morale."

In August 1946, Comrade Mao Zedong met with American journalist Anna Louise Strong in Yan'an and delivered his famous view that all reactionaries are paper tigers. Below is the full text of this conversation:

"Q: Do you think there is hope for a political and peaceful solution to China's problems in the near future?
A: This depends on the attitude of the U.S. government. If the American people can stop the U.S. reactionaries from helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war, then there is hope for peace.

Q: If the U.S. does not provide further assistance beyond what it has already given, how long can Chiang Kai-shek last?
A: More than a year.

Q: Can Chiang Kai-shek support himself economically for so long?
A: Yes.

Q: If the U.S. declares that it will not provide any further assistance to Chiang Kai-shek?
A: At present, there is no sign that the U.S. government and Chiang Kai-shek have any intention to stop the war in the short term.

Q: Can the Communist Party last?
A: As for our own wishes, we don't want to fight even for a day. But if circumstances force us to fight, we will fight to the end.

Q: If American people ask why the Communist Party is fighting, what should I say?
A: Because Chiang Kai-shek wants to massacre the Chinese people, and the people want to survive, they must defend themselves. This is something that Americans can understand.

Q: What is your view on whether the U.S. might launch an anti-Soviet war?
A: The propaganda about an anti-Soviet war includes two aspects. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism is indeed preparing for an anti-Soviet war; the current anti-Soviet war propaganda and other anti-Soviet propaganda are part of the political preparation for an anti-Soviet war. On the other hand, this propaganda is a smokescreen used by U.S. reactionaries to cover up the many actual contradictions they are currently facing. These contradictions are the contradictions between U.S. reactionaries and the American people, as well as the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and other capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries. The slogan of an anti-Soviet war by the U.S. reactionaries currently means, in actual terms, oppressing the American people and expanding U.S. imperialism's aggression to the capitalist world. You know, Hitler and his accomplice Japanese militarists used the anti-Soviet slogan for a long time to enslave their own people and invade other countries, and now the U.S. reactionaries are doing the same.

The U.S. reactionaries want to instigate war, first of all, they must attack the American people. They are already attacking the American people, politically and economically oppressing American workers and democrats, preparing to implement fascism in the U.S. The American people should rise up to resist the attacks of U.S. reactionaries. I believe they will do so.

Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, there is an extremely vast area, with many capitalist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The U.S. reactionaries, before subduing these countries, cannot talk about attacking the Soviet Union. Now the U.S. controls more places in the Pacific than the British ever did, controlling Japan, Kuomintang-ruled China, half of Korea, and the South Pacific; it has long controlled Central and South America; it still wants to control the entire British Empire and Western Europe. Under various pretexts, the U.S. is conducting large-scale military deployments in many countries, establishing military bases. The U.S. reactionaries say that all the naval bases they have established and are preparing to establish around the world are for opposing the Soviet Union. Indeed, these military bases are aimed at the Soviet Union. However, at present, the first to suffer from U.S. aggression is not the Soviet Union but the countries where these military bases are established. I believe that it will not be long before these countries realize who is truly oppressing them, the Soviet Union or the U.S. The U.S. reactionaries will one day discover that they are in the opposition of all the peoples of the world.

Of course, I am not saying that the U.S. reactionaries do not want to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the defender of world peace and a powerful factor blocking the U.S. reactionaries from establishing world hegemony. With the Soviet Union, the dreams of U.S. and world reactionaries can never be realized; therefore, the U.S. reactionaries hate the Soviet Union very much and indeed dream of destroying this socialist country. However, at present, soon after the end of the Second World War, the U.S. reactionaries are making such a big fuss about the U.S.-Soviet war, creating chaos, it makes one wonder about their actual purpose. Originally, they are using the anti-Soviet slogan to crazily attack American workers and democrats and turn all the countries they want to expand into U.S. vassals. I think the American people and the peoples of all countries threatened by U.S. aggression should unite, oppose the attacks of U.S. reactionaries and their lackeys in various countries. Only when this struggle is victorious can the Third World War be avoided, otherwise it cannot be avoided.

Q: This is a good explanation. But what if the U.S. uses the atomic bomb? What if the U.S. bombs the Soviet Union from bases in Iceland, Okinawa, and China?
A: The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by U.S. reactionaries to scare people, it looks scary but is actually not scary. Of course, the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but what determines the victory or defeat of a war is the people, not one or two new weapons.

All reactionaries are paper tigers. They look ferocious, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force is not with the reactionaries but with the people. In 1917, before the February Revolution in Russia, who had the real power within Russia? On the surface, the Tsar seemed to have power; but the February Revolution blew the Tsar away with a gust of wind. Ultimately, the power in Russia was with the workers, peasants, and soldiers' soviets. The Tsar was just a paper tiger. Wasn't Hitler once considered very powerful? But history has proven that he is a paper tiger. Mussolini is the same, and so is Japanese imperialism. On the contrary, the power of the Soviet Union and the peoples of various countries who love democracy and freedom is much stronger than people had expected.

Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters, the U.S. reactionaries, are also paper tigers. When it comes to U.S. imperialism, people seem to think it is incredibly powerful, and the Chinese reactionaries are using this 'power' to intimidate the Chinese people. But the U.S. reactionaries will also be proven to have no real power, just like all reactionaries in history. In the U.S., there is another class of people who are truly powerful, and that is the American people.

Taking China as an example, what we rely on is just corn and rifles, but history will ultimately prove that this corn and rifles are stronger than Chiang Kai-shek's planes and tanks. Although there are still many difficulties in front of the Chinese people, the Chinese people will suffer long-term hardships under the joint attack of U.S. imperialism and Chinese reactionaries, but these reactionaries will one day fail, and we will one day win. The reason is not that the reactionaries represent reaction, while we represent progress."

On December 25, 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a report titled "The Current Situation and Our Tasks" at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In this report, Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"The Communist Party of China, based on the science of Marxism-Leninism, has a clear understanding of the international and domestic situation, knowing that all internal and external reactionaries must be defeated and can be defeated. When the sky seems dark, we pointed out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, the storm will soon pass, and dawn is just ahead. When, in July 1946, the Kuomintang bandits launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary war, the Kuomintang bandits thought that they only needed three to six months to defeat the People's Liberation Army. They thought they had 2 million regular troops, 100 million irregular troops, 100 million military and auxiliary forces in the rear, totaling 400 million military forces; they had used the time to complete their preparations for the attack; they had regained control of the major cities; they had a population of over 300 million; they had taken over the entire equipment of 1 million Japanese invaders in China; they had obtained significant military and financial aid from the U.S. government. They also thought that the People's Liberation Army was very tired after eight years of anti-Japanese war and was far inferior to the Kuomintang army in numbers and equipment; the liberated areas still had only over 100 million people (editor's note: the population census at that time was not accurate, generally it was believed that the total population of the country was 450 million, after liberation, through an accurate census, it was found that the population of China was 600 million), and in most of these areas, the reactionary feudal forces had not been eliminated, land reform was not universal and thorough, the rear of the People's Liberation Army was not solid. Based on these foundations, the Kuomintang bandits, disregarding the peaceful wishes of the Chinese people, finally tore up the ceasefire agreement signed between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in January 1946 and the resolutions of the political consultation conference of all parties, launched an adventurous war. At that time, we said that the enemy's military superiority was only a temporary phenomenon, only a factor that temporarily played a role; U.S. imperialist aid was also only a factor that temporarily played a role; while the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war, the support or opposition of the people, was a factor that constantly played a role; and in this regard, the People's Liberation Army had the advantage. The just, patriotic, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war must gain the support of the people of the whole country. This is the political basis for defeating Chiang Kai-shek. The experience of eighteen months of war fully proved our argument.

The Kuomintang reactionary clique, when launching a nationwide counter-revolutionary domestic war in 1946, dared to take risks not only relying on their own superior military forces but mainly relying on what they thought was an extremely powerful, invincible, atomic bomb-wielding U.S. imperialism. On the one hand, they thought that U.S. imperialism could supply them with military and financial needs like a river; on the other hand, they arrogantly imagined the so-called 'inevitable war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union,' the so-called 'inevitable outbreak of the Third World War.' This reliance on U.S. imperialism is a common characteristic of all reactionary forces in the world after the end of the Second World War. This matter reflects the seriousness of the blow dealt to world capitalism by the Second World War, reflects the weakness of the reactionary forces of various countries and their psychological panic and loss of confidence, reflects the strength of the revolutionary forces of the world, making the reactionary forces of various countries, except relying on the aid of U.S. imperialism, feel that there is no way out. But in reality, after the Second World War, is U.S. imperialism as powerful as the Kuomintang and the reactionary forces of various countries imagined? Can it really supply the Kuomintang and the reactionary forces of various countries like a river? Not so. The economic strength of U.S. imperialism, which was enhanced during the Second World War, encountered an unstable and shrinking domestic and international market. The further shrinkage of this market would lead to the outbreak of an economic crisis. The war prosperity of the U.S. is only a temporary phenomenon. Its strength is only superficial and temporary. The crisis is like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano. This situation forces the U.S. imperialists to establish a plan to enslave the world, like a beast, rampaging through Europe, Asia, and other places, gathering the reactionary forces of various countries, those dregs spat out by the people, forming an anti-democratic camp of imperialism, preparing for war, aiming to defeat the democratic forces in the future, in a distant time, one day launching the Third World War. This is a crazy plan. The democratic forces of the world must defeat this plan and can completely defeat it. The strength of the anti-imperialist camp of the world exceeds the strength of the imperialist camp. The advantage is on our side, not on the enemy's side."

In November 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote an article titled "All Revolutionary Forces of the World Unite to Oppose Imperialist Aggression" for the magazine "Struggle for Lasting Peace, Struggle for People's Democracy," pointing out that "overestimating the enemy's strength and underestimating the revolutionary forces would be a great mistake":

"After the victory of the Second World War, the U.S. imperialists, who took the place of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists, are crazily preparing for a new world war, threatening the world. This enemy is still powerful, so all revolutionary forces within each country must unite, and all countries' revolutionary forces must unite, forming a united front against imperialism led by the Soviet Union, and following the correct policy, otherwise they cannot win. This enemy's foundation is weak, it is internally divided, it is detached from the people, it has an economic crisis that cannot be solved, so it can be defeated. Overestimating the enemy's strength and underestimating the revolutionary forces would be a great mistake."

On January 18, 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote an instruction for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China titled "On Several Important Issues in the Current Party Policy," telling us that, in general, strategically, we should despise the enemy, but at the same time, we should also pay attention to the art of struggle, and in every specific struggle, we should take the enemy seriously:

"Oppose the overestimation of the enemy's strength. For example, fearing U.S. imperialism, fearing to fight in the Kuomintang area, fearing to overthrow the comprador feudal system, distribute land to landlords, and confiscate bureaucratic capital, fearing a long war, etc. These are all incorrect. The rule of all world capitalism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique in China is rotten and has no future. We have reason to despise them. We have the confidence and determination to defeat all internal and external enemies of the Chinese people. However, in every specific struggle (whether in military, political, economic, or ideological struggles), we must not despise the enemy, on the contrary, we must take the enemy seriously, concentrate all our strength to fight, and only then can we achieve victory. When we correctly point out that we should despise the enemy strategically, we must not despise the enemy in every specific struggle. If we overestimate the enemy's strength in general, and thus do not dare to overthrow them and win, we will commit the right-opportunist error. If we do not adopt a cautious attitude in every specific struggle, do not pay attention to the art of struggle, do not concentrate all our strength to fight, do not pay attention to winning over all the allies we should win (middle peasants, independent industrialists and businessmen, the middle class, students, teachers, professors, and general intellectuals, general civil servants, freelancers, and enlightened gentry), we will commit the 'left'-opportunist error."

On November 18, 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in Moscow, saying:

"In 1946, when Chiang Kai-shek started to attack us, many of our comrades, and the people of the whole country, were very worried: could the war be won? I was also worried about this matter. But we had a belief. At that time, an American reporter came to Yan'an, named Anna Louise Strong. When I talked to her, I talked about many problems, Chiang Kai-shek, Hitler, Japan, the U.S., the atomic bomb, etc. I said that all those who claim to be strong reactionaries are all paper tigers. The reason is that they are detached from the people. Look, wasn't Hitler a paper tiger? Wasn't Hitler overthrown? I also talked about the Tsar being a paper tiger, the Chinese emperor being a paper tiger, Japanese imperialism being a paper tiger, look, they all fell. U.S. imperialism has not fallen, it still has the atomic bomb, I think it will also fall, it is also a paper tiger. Chiang Kai-shek is very strong, with over 400 million regular troops. At that time, we were in Yan'an. How many people were in Yan'an? There were 7,000 people. How many troops did we have? We had 900,000 guerrillas, all divided into dozens of bases by Chiang Kai-shek. But we said that Chiang Kai-shek is just a paper tiger, and we will definitely defeat him. To struggle against the enemy, we formed a concept over a long period: that is, strategically, we must despise all enemies, and tactically, we must take all enemies seriously. That is to say, in general, we must despise them, and in every specific problem, we must take them seriously. If we do not despise the enemy in general, we will commit the opportunist error. Marx and Engels, only two people, at that time said that world capitalism would be overthrown. But in specific problems, in the problem of every enemy, if we do not take them seriously, we will commit the adventurist error. War can only be fought one battle at a time, the enemy can only be defeated one part at a time. Factories can only be built one by one, farmers can only plow one field at a time, and even eating is the same. We despise eating strategically: this meal we can eat. But specifically eating, it is one mouthful at a time, you cannot swallow a whole table of food at once. This is called solving one by one, breaking one by one in military books."

On November 18, 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries in Moscow, analyzing the current world situation, pointing out that now the strength of socialism has surpassed the strength of imperialism, and the east wind has overcome the west wind:

"I think the current international situation has reached a new turning point. Now there are two winds in the world: the east wind and the west wind. The Chinese have a saying: 'It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind.' I think the current situation is characterized by the east wind prevailing over the west wind, that is, the strength of socialism has a dominant advantage over the strength of imperialism."

On the previous day, November 17, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech to Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union:

"The world wind direction has changed. The struggle between the socialist camp and the capitalist camp is either the west wind prevailing over the east wind or the east wind prevailing over the west wind. Now there are 2.7 billion people in the world, the population of socialist countries is nearly 1 billion, the population of newly independent former colonial countries is over 700 million, the population of capitalist countries that are struggling for independence or complete independence and have a tendency towards neutrality is 600 million, and the population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million, and their internal divisions are severe. Where will the 'earthquake' occur? Now it is not the west wind prevailing over the east wind, but the east wind prevailing over the west wind."

On November 6, 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution:

"Imperialism, in addition to relying on the oppression of its domestic people and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, also hopes for war. But what can they hope for from war? In the past half-century, we have experienced two world wars. After the First World War, the great October Socialist Revolution appeared in Russia. After the Second World War, more revolutions appeared in Eastern Europe and the East. If the imperialist gangsters decide to launch the Third World War, they will not achieve anything other than accelerating the fundamental collapse of the world capitalist system."

On February 27, 1957, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech titled "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the 11th Enlarged Meeting of the State Council. In the 10th part of this speech, "Can Bad Things Turn into Good Things?", he said:

"Now people all over the world are talking about whether there will be a Third World War. We must also have spiritual preparation and analysis for this question. We are firmly against war and for peace. However, if imperialism insists on launching a war, we should not be afraid. Our attitude towards this question is the same as our attitude towards all 'troubles': first, oppose; second, do not fear. After the First World War, a Soviet Union emerged, with 200 million people. After the Second World War, a socialist camp emerged, with a total of 900 million people. If imperialists insist on launching the Third World War, it can be determined that the result will be that more billions of people will turn to socialism, and the remaining territory of imperialism will not be much, and it is possible that the entire imperialist system will collapse.

The mutually opposing and struggling sides will inevitably transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling sides will not transform. The class that is most willing to change its position in the world is the proletariat, followed by the semi-proletariat, because one has nothing, and the other has little. Now the U.S. controls the majority of votes in the United Nations and controls many places in the world, but this situation is temporary, and this situation will change one day. The poor status of China and its powerlessness in international affairs will also change, poor countries will become rich countries, and powerlessness will become powerful—transforming in the opposite direction. Here, the decisive condition is the socialist system and the unity and struggle of the people."

On June 28, 1950, when U.S. imperialism openly launched an invasion of Korea and armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the 8th meeting of the Central People's Government Council:

"The Chinese people have long declared that the affairs of the world should be handled by the people of each country themselves, the affairs of Asia should be handled by the Asian people themselves, and not by the U.S. The U.S. aggression against Asia can only arouse the broad and resolute resistance of the Asian people. Truman declared on January 5 of this year that the U.S. would not interfere with Taiwan, but now he has proven that this is false, and at the same time, he has torn up all the international agreements of the U.S. regarding non-interference in Chinese internal affairs. The U.S. has thus exposed its imperialist face, which is very beneficial to China and the Asian people. The U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc., is completely unreasonable, and the sympathy of all Chinese people and the broad sympathy of the people of the world will stand on the side of the invaded, and will definitely not stand on the side of U.S. imperialism. They will neither be tempted by imperialist benefits nor fear imperialist threats. Imperialism is strong on the outside but weak on the inside because it lacks the support of the people. The people of the whole country and the people of the whole world should unite, make full preparations, and defeat any provocation by U.S. imperialism."

On February 14, 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at a reception held by the Soviet Embassy in China to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, pointing out:

"Under the great cooperation of our two great countries, I believe that the imperialist plans of aggression will be smashed.

"We can all see that under the great cooperation of our two countries, all imperialist plans of aggression will be smashed. They will definitely be thoroughly smashed. As long as imperialism launches an aggressive war, we and the people of the whole world will definitely wipe them off the face of the earth!"

On September 8, 1958, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered a speech at the State Council, saying:

"The current situation is favorable to the people of the world who are striving for peace.

"The overall trend is that the east wind prevails over the west wind.

"U.S. imperialism has occupied our territory of Taiwan for nine years, and recently it has also sent its armed forces to occupy Lebanon. The U.S. has established hundreds of military bases in many countries around the world. China's territory of Taiwan, Lebanon, and all U.S. military bases in foreign countries are nooses around the neck of U.S. imperialism. It is not others but the Americans themselves who make these nooses and put them around their own necks, handing the other end of the noose to the Chinese people, the Arab people, and all the people of the world who love peace and oppose aggression. The longer the U.S. aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their neck will be.

"The U.S. imperialists create tension all over the world to achieve their goals of aggression and enslavement of the people of various countries. The U.S. imperialists think that tension is always in their favor, but the fact is that the tensions created by the U.S. have gone in the opposite direction of their wishes, serving to mobilize the people of the world to oppose the U.S. aggressors.

"If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will one day be sentenced to death by the people of the world. Other U.S. accomplices will be the same."

On September 29, 1958, after inspecting several provinces along the Yangtze River, Comrade Mao Zedong returned to Beijing. In a conversation with Xinhua News Agency reporters, he said:

"The lifespan of imperialists will not be long, because they do evil, specially supporting the reactionary forces of various countries, occupying a large number of colonies, semi-colonies, and military bases, threatening peace with atomic war. In this way, they force more than 90% of the people in the world to either rise up against them or be ready to rise up against them. However, imperialists are still alive, they are still rampaging in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are still oppressing the people of their own countries in the West. This situation must change. Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly U.S. imperialism, is the task of the people of the world."

    毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    人民日报编辑部（一九五八年十月二十七日）
    怎样认识革命力量和反动力量的问题，在中国，在世界范围内，都还是一个大问题，有许多人总是不得解决。帝国主义及其在各国的走狗有如夕阳西下，社会主义和为社会主义所支持的民族革命运动，却正如旭日东升。这是我们时代的特点。帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了，他们已经快完蛋了。应当是反动派畏惧革命力量，而不是革命力量畏惧反动派。现在有许多人还看不到这些，他们还有迷信，还有幻想，还对帝国主义特别是美帝国主义怀着敬畏的心理。他们在这个问题上还是被动的。一切先进的人们，一切马克思主义者和革命家，应当在他们中间进行说服工作，使广大人民具备革命的信心和决心，具备革命的远见性和坚定性，这是加速革命事业胜利发展的必不可少的一个精神条件
    毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，观察问题要抓住它的本质，不要为表面现象所迷惑。三十多年来，在我国国内阶级斗争的每一个重要关头，毛泽东同志总是根据马克思列宁主义的科学，对于斗争的形势作出深刻的判断，向人们指出一切反动派必将灭亡，革命事业必将胜利。他用“纸老虎”来说明貌似强大实际虚弱的帝国主义和一切反动势力，他用“星星之火，可以燎原”这一句成语来说明革命事业中一天一天地成长着的新生力量，并且在这种估量之下来布置自己的战略计划。毛泽东同志的关于革命力量不可战胜、暂时强大的反动力量必定失败的思想，武装了中国共产党人，教育和鼓舞了中国人民，引导我们取得了伟大的胜利。“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，毛泽东同志的这个英明论断，早已为中国革命的胜利所证明，它还要为中国和全世界革命事业的胜利发展继续证明。最近，“世界知识”杂志编辑部，把毛泽东同志历来阐述“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的文章、讲演和谈话，辑录在一起发表。这是一件有重大政治意义的工作。对于人民反对帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫的斗争，很有益处。现在，我们把他们辑录的文章，补充了一些有关的重要材料，并且在体例和段落上作了一些调整，发表于此。全篇文章仍然分做三个部分，第一部分论述代表腐朽势力的帝国主义和一切反动派都没有前途，它们一时的猖獗，不过是表示垂死挣扎；第二部分论述帝国主义和一切反动派都是外强中干，革命的人们有理由藐视它们，但是在每一个具体的斗争中间又要重视它们；第三部分论述当前国际形势的基本特点，东风已经压倒西风，社会主义力量已经超过帝国主义力量。这些文章、讲演和谈话，虽然多数是发表过的，没有发表过的只占少数，时间前后相距二十年之久，又是采取集纳的形式；但是看起来却使人感觉好像是一篇新的完整的政治论文。其原因是帝国主义及其走狗为一方，各国人民为另一方，这样一个基本的矛盾并没有解决，美帝国主义又特别张牙舞爪，以原子战争威胁世界和平，被压迫受威胁的人民的心思被这种紧张局势所吸引，迫切地要求解决这个矛盾，故尔使得读者对毛泽东同志关于论述解决这个矛盾诸多问题中的一个首先和主要的问题，纸老虎还是并非纸老虎的问题，自然感觉兴趣。
    一
    毛泽东同志在一九四○年一月发表的“新民主主义论”这部有历史意义的著作中，指出资本主义已经到了腐朽死亡的阶段，共产主义“正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界”：
    “共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。封建主义的思想体系和社会制度，是进了历史博物馆的东西了。资本主义的思想体系和社会制度，已有一部分进了博物馆（在苏联）；其余部分，也已‘日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕’，快进博物馆了。惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”
    毛泽东同志又在“新民主主义论”里指出，一切代表腐朽力量的反动派的猖狂，都是表示它们的垂死挣扎：
    “一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。这在中国是如此，在整个东方也是如此，在世界也是如此。”
     一九四五年六月十七日，毛泽东同志在中国革命死难烈士追悼大会上的讲话里指出，反动派越反动就越接近于灭亡：
    “自我批评的方法只能用于人民的内部，希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，例如我们的人民解放战争，土地革命，揭露帝国主义，‘刺激’他们，把他们打倒，制裁他们的犯法行为，‘只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动’。然后，才有希望在平等和互利的条件下和外国帝国主义国家打交道。然后，才有希望把已经缴械了的和投降了的地主阶级分子、官僚资产阶级分子和国民党反动派及其帮凶们给以由坏人变好人的教育，并尽可能地把他们变成好人。中国的许多自由主义分子，亦即旧民主主义分子，亦即杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登们所属望的和经常企图争取的所谓‘民主个人主义’的拥护者们之所以往往陷入被动地位，对问题的观察往往不正确——对美国统治者的观察往往不正确，对国民党的观察往往不正确，对苏联的观察往往不正确，对中国共产党的观察也往往不正确，就是因为他们没有或不赞成用历史唯物主义的观点去看问题的缘故。
    “先进的人们，共产党人，各民主党派，觉悟了的工人，青年学生，进步的知识分子，有责任去团结人民中国内部的中间阶层、中间派、各阶层中的落后分子、一切还在动摇犹豫着的人们（这些人们还要长期地动摇着，坚定了又动摇，一遇困难就要动摇的），用善意去帮助他们，批评他们的动摇性，教育他们，争取他们站到人民大众方面来，不让帝国主义把他们拉过去，叫他们丢掉幻想，准备斗争。不要以为胜利了，就不要做工作了。还要做工作，还要做很多的耐心的工作，才能真正地争取这些人。争取了他们，帝国主义就完全孤立了，艾奇逊的一套就无所施其伎了。”二
    一九四二年十月十二日，毛泽东同志在为延安“解放日报”写的社论“第二次世界大战的转折点”里，分析了反动势力外强中干的实质，提醒革命的人们不要为表面的现象所迷惑。毛泽东同志写道：
    “在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。整个法西斯势力的兴起及其进行了几年的侵略战争，正是这种最后挣扎的表现；而在战争中，又以攻击斯大林格勒表现它自己的最后挣扎。在这个历史的转折点面前，全世界反法西斯阵线内的人们也有许多被法西斯的凶恶面孔所迷惑，看不出它的实质。”
    反动派总是吹嘘自己的貌似强大的武力。在人民中间，也有一部分人对于反动派的军事力量存在着不同程度的畏惧心理。这是“唯武器论”的观点。毛泽东同志在一九三八年五月所写的著名论文“论持久战”里，对于这种观点作了深刻的批评：
    “所谓‘唯武器论’，是战争问题中的机械论，是主观地和片面地看问题的意见。我们的意见与此相反，不但看到武器，而且看到人力。武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”
    一九四六年八月，毛泽东同志在延安接见美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗，发表了关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的著名论点。下面是这个谈话的全文：
    “斯问：你觉得中国的问题在不久的将来有政治解决、和平解决的希望没有？
    “毛答：这要看美国政府的态度。如果美国人民拖住了帮助蒋介石打内战的美国反动派的手的话，和平是有希望的。
    “问：如果美国除了它所已经给的以外不再帮助了，那末蒋介石还可以打多久？
    “答：一年以上。
    “问：蒋介石在经济上可能支持那样久吗？
    “答：可以的。
    “问：如果美国说明此后不再给蒋介石以什么帮助了呢？
    “答：在现时还没有什么征象表示美国政府和蒋介石有任何在短时期内停止战争的愿望。
    “问：共产党能支持多久？
    “答：就我们自己的愿望说，我们连一天也不愿意打。但是如果形势迫使我们不得不打的话，我们是能够一直打到底的。
    “问：如果美国人民问到共产党为什么作战，我该怎样回答呢？
    “答：因为蒋介石要屠杀中国人民，人民要生存就必须自卫。这是美国人所能够理解的。
    “问：你对于美国是否可能举行反苏战争如何看法？
    “答：关于反苏战争的宣传，包括两个方面。在一方面，美国帝国主义确是在准备着反苏战争的，目前的反苏战争宣传和其他的反苏宣传就是对于反苏战争的政治准备；在另一方面，这种宣传是美国反动派用以掩盖当前美国帝国主义所直接面对着的许多实际矛盾所放的烟幕。这些矛盾就是美国反动派同美国人民之间的矛盾，以及美国帝国主义同其他资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家之间的矛盾。美国反苏战争的口号在目前的实际意义是压迫美国人民和向资本主义世界扩张它的侵略势力。你知道，希特勒和他的伙伴日本军阀在一个长时期中都曾经把反苏的口号作为奴役本国人民和侵略其他国家的托辞，现在美国反动派的做法也正是这样。
    “美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。他们已经在进攻美国人民了，他们从政治上、经济上压迫美国的工人和民主分子，准备在美国实行法西斯主义。美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻，我相信他们是会这样做的。
    “美国和苏联中间隔着极其辽阔的地带，这里有欧、亚、非三洲的许多资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家，美国反动派在没有压服这些国家之前，是谈不到进攻苏联的。现在美国在太平洋控制了比英国过去的全部势力范围还要多的地方，它控制着日本、国民党统治的中国、半个朝鲜和南太平洋；它早已控制着中南美；它还想控制整个大英帝国和西欧。美国在各种借口之下，在许多国家进行大规模的军事布置，建立军事基地。美国反动派说，他们在世界各地已经建立和准备建立的一切海军基地，都是为着反对苏联的。不错，这些军事基地是指向苏联。但是，在现时，首先受到美国侵略的不是苏联，而是这些被建立军事基地的国家。我相信，不要很久，这些国家将会认识到真正压迫它们的是谁，是苏联还是美国。美国反动派终有一天将会发现他们自己是处在了全世界人民的反对中。
    “当然，我不是说，美国反动派不想进攻苏联。苏联是世界和平的保卫者，是阻碍美国反动派建立世界霸权的强大的因素，有了苏联，美国和世界反动派的野心就根本不能实现；因此，美国反动派非常痛恨苏联，确实梦想消灭这个社会主义国家。但是在目前，在第二次世界大战结束不久的时候，美国反动派如此大吹大擂地强调美苏战争，闹得乌烟瘴气，就使人不能不来看看他们的实际目的。原来他们是在反苏的口号下面，疯狂地进攻美国的工人和民主分子，和把美国向外扩张的一切对象国都变成美国的附属物。我以为美国人民和一切受到美国侵略威胁的国家的人民，应当团结起来，反对美国反动派及其在各国的走狗的进攻。只有这个斗争胜利了，第三次世界大战才可以避免，否则是不能避免的。
    “问：这是一个很好的说明。但是如果美国使用原子炸弹呢？如果美国从冰岛、冲绳岛以及中国的基地轰炸苏联呢？
    “答：原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。当然原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎，看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。在一九一七年俄国二月革命以前，俄国国内究竟那一方面拥有真正的力量呢？从表面上看，当时的沙皇是有力量的；但是二月革命的一阵风，就把沙皇吹走了。归根结蒂，俄国的力量是在工农兵苏维埃这方面。沙皇不过是一只纸老虎。希特勒不是曾经被人们看作很有力量的吗？但是历史证明了他是一只纸老虎。墨索里尼也是如此，日本帝国主义也是如此。相反的，苏联以及各国爱好民主自由的人民的力量，却是比人们所预料的强大得多。
    “蒋介石和他的支持者美国反动派也都是纸老虎。提起美国帝国主义，人们似乎觉得它是强大得不得了的，中国的反动派正在拿美国的‘强大’来吓唬中国人民。但是美国反动派也将要同一切历史上的反动派一样，被证明为并没有什么力量。在美国，另有一类人是真正有力量的，这就是美国人民。
    “拿中国的情形来说，我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。虽然在中国人民面前还存在着许多困难，中国人民在美国帝国主义和中国反动派的联合进攻之下，将要受到长时间的苦难，但是这些反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。”
    一九四七年十二月二十五日，毛泽东同志在中共中央会议上作了“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告。在这个报告里，毛泽东同志说：
    “中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际与国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。当着天空中似乎是黑暗的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，暴风雨即将过去，曙光即在前头。当着一九四六年七月，蒋介石匪帮发动全国规模的反革命战争的时候，蒋介石匪帮认为，只须三个月至六个月，就可以打败人民解放军。他们认为他们有正规军二百万，非正规军一百余万，后方军事机关及部队一百余万，共有军事力量四百余万人；他们已经利用时间完成了进攻的准备；他们重新控制了大城市；他们拥有三万万以上的人口；他们接收了日本侵华军队一百万人的全部装备；他们取得了美国政府在军事上与财政上的重大援助。他们又认为，中国人民解放军在八年抗日战争中已经打得很疲倦，而且在数量上与装备上远不及国民党军队；中国解放区还只有一万万多一点的人口（编者按：当时的人口调查不确实，一般认为全国只有四亿五千万人，解放以后经过确实调查，中国人口有六万万），其中大部分地区的反动封建势力还没有被肃清，土地改革还不普遍与不彻底，人民解放军的后方还不是巩固的。在这些基础上，蒋介石匪帮就不顾中国人民的和平愿望，最后地撕毁在一九四六年一月间签订的国共两党的停战协定及各党派政治协商会议的决议，发动了冒险的战争。那时我们说，敌人军事力量的优势，这只是暂时的现象，这只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；而蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。十八个月战争的经验，充分地证明了我们的论断。
    …………
    “蒋介石反动集团在一九四六年发动全国规模的反人民的国内战争的时候，他们之所以敢于冒险，不但依靠他们自己的优势的军事力量，而且主要地依靠他们认为是异常强大的、举世无敌的、手里拿着原子弹的美国帝国主义，一方面，以为美国帝国主义能够像流水一样地供给他们以军事上与财政上的需要；另一方面，狂妄地设想所谓‘美苏必战’，所谓‘第三次世界大战必然爆发’。这种对于美国帝国主义的依赖，是第二次世界大战结束以后全世界各国反动势力的共同特点。这件事，反映了第二次世界大战给予世界资本主义的打击的严重性，反映了各国反动派力量的薄弱及其心理的恐慌与丧失信心，反映了全世界革命力量的强大，使得各国反动派除了依靠美国帝国主义的援助就感到毫无出路。但是，在实际上，在第二次世界大战以后的美国帝国主义，是否真如蒋介石及各国反动派所设想的那么强大呢？是否真能像流水一样的从美国接济蒋介石及各国反动派呢？并不如此。美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场与国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的与暂时的。危机就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。这种情况，迫使美国帝国主义分子建立了奴役世界的计划，像野兽一样，向欧、亚两洲及其他地方乱窜，集合各国的反动势力，那些被人民唾弃的渣滓，组成帝国主义及反民主的阵营，反对以苏联为首的一切民主势力，准备战争，企图在将来，在遥远的时间内，有一天发动第三次世界大战打败民主力量。这是一个狂妄的计划。全世界民主势力必须打败这个计划，也完全能够打败它。全世界反帝国主义阵营的力量超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。优势是在我们方面，不是在敌人方面。”
    一九四八年十一月，毛泽东同志在给“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”杂志所写的论文“全世界革命力量团结起来，反对帝国主义的侵略”里指出，“对于敌人力量的过高估计和对于革命力量估计不足，将是一个极大的错误”：
    “第二次世界大战胜利以后，代替德意日法西斯的地位而疯狂地准备着新的世界战争、威胁全世界的美国帝国主义及其在各国的走狗们，反映了资本主义世界的极端腐败及其濒于灭亡的恐怖情绪。这个敌人还是有力量的，因此，每一个国家内部的一切革命力量必须团结起来，一切国家的革命力量必须团结起来，必须组成以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的统一战线，并遵循正确的政策，否则就不能胜利。这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。对于敌人力量的过高估计和对于革命力量的估计不足，将是一个极大的错误。”
    一九四八年一月十八日，毛泽东同志在为中共中央写的对党内的指示“关于目前党的政策中的几个重要问题”里告诉我们，在全体上，在战略上，要轻视敌人，同时又要讲究斗争艺术，在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，又要重视敌人：
    “反对对敌人的力量估计过高。例如，惧怕美帝国主义，惧怕到国民党区域作战，惧怕消灭买办封建制度、分配地主土地和没收官僚资本，惧怕长期战争等。这些都是不正确的。全世界资本主义和中国蒋介石反动集团的统治，已经腐烂，没有前途。我们有理由轻视它们。我们有把握、有信心战胜中国人民的一切内外敌人。但是在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上（不论是在军事的、政治的、经济的、或思想的斗争上），却又决不可轻视敌人，相反，应当重视敌人，集中全力作战，方能取得胜利。当着我们正确地指出在全体上，在战略上，应当轻视敌人的时候，却决不可在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，也轻视敌人。如果我们在全体上过高估计敌人力量，因而不敢推翻他们，不敢胜利，我们就要犯右倾机会主义错误。如果我们在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，不采取谨慎态度，不讲究斗争艺术，不集中全力作战，不注意争取一切应当争取的同盟者（中农，独立工商业者，中产阶级，学生、教员、教授和一般知识分子，一般公务人员，自由职业者和开明绅士），我们就要犯‘左’倾机会主义错误。”
    一九五七年十一月十八日，毛泽东同志在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议上的发言里说：
    “一九四六年蒋介石开始向我们进攻的时候，我们许多同志，全国人民，都很忧虑：战争是不是能够打赢？我本人也忧虑这件事。但是我们有一条信心。那时有一个美国记者到了延安，名字叫安娜·路易斯·斯特朗。我同她谈话的时候谈了许多问题，蒋介石、希特勒、日本、美国、原子弹等等。我说一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。你看，希特勒是不是纸老虎？希特勒不是被打倒了吗？我也谈到沙皇是纸老虎，中国皇帝是纸老虎，日本帝国主义是纸老虎，你看，都倒了。美帝国主义没有倒，还有原子弹，我看也是要倒的，也是纸老虎。蒋介石很强大，有四百多万正规军。那时我们在延安。延安这个地方有多少人？有七千人。我们有多少军队呢？我们有九十万游击队，统统被蒋介石分割成几十个根据地。但是我们说，蒋介石不过是一个纸老虎，我们一定会打赢他。为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。也就是说在整体上我们一定要藐视它，在一个一个的具体问题上我们一定要重视它。如果不是在整体上藐视敌人，我们就要犯机会主义的错误。马克思、恩格斯只有两个人，那时他们就说全世界资本主义要被打倒。但是在具体问题上，在一个一个敌人的问题上，如果我们不重视它，我们就要犯冒险主义的错误。打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。工厂只能一个一个地盖，农民犁田只能一块一块地犁，就是吃饭也是如此。我们在战略上藐视吃饭：这顿饭我们能够吃下去。但是具体地吃，却是一口口地吃的，你不可能把一桌酒席一口吞下去。这叫做各个解决，军事书上叫做各个击破。”
    三
    一九五七年十一月十八日，毛泽东同志在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议上的发言里，分析了当前的世界形势，指出现在是社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，东风压倒了西风：
    “我认为现在国际形势到了一个新的转折点。世界上现在有两股风：东风，西风。中国有句成语：‘不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风。’我认为目前形势的特点是东风压倒西风，也就是说，社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量占了压倒的优势。”
    在这个发言的前一天，即十一月十七日，毛泽东同志在对我国留苏学生的讲话中说：
    “世界的风向变了。社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营之间的斗争不是西风压倒东风，就是东风压倒西风。现在全世界共有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立以及带有中立倾向的资本主义国家人口有六亿，帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。那里会发生‘地震’。现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”
    一九五七年十一月六日，毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年会议上的讲话中说：
    “帝国主义除了把自己的命运寄托在对国内人民和殖民地半殖民地人民的迫害以外，还指望着战争。但是他们能够从战争中指望什么呢？半个世纪以来，我们已经经历过两次世界大战。第一次世界大战之后，在俄国出现了伟大的十月社会主义革命。第二次世界大战之后，在东欧和东方出现了更多的革命。如果帝国主义好汉们决心发动第三次世界大战，他们除了促使世界资本主义制度根本灭亡以外，不会得到什么别的结果。”
    一九五七年二月二十七日，毛泽东同志在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上，作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。他在这篇讲演的第十部分“坏事能否变成好事？”里说：
    “现在世界各国的人们都在谈论着会不会打第三次世界大战。对于这个问题，我们也要有精神准备，也要有分析。我们是坚持和平反对战争的。但是，如果帝国主义一定要发动战争，我们也不要害怕。我们对待这个问题的态度，同对待一切‘乱子’的态度一样，第一条，反对；第二条，不怕。第一次世界大战以后，出了一个苏联，两亿人口。第二次世界大战以后，出了一个社会主义阵营，一共九亿人口。如果帝国主义者一定要发动第三次世界大战，可以断定，其结果必定又要有多少亿人口转到社会主义方面，帝国主义剩下的地盘就不多了，也有可能整个帝国主义制度全部崩溃。
    “矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。世界上最愿意改变自己地位的是无产阶级，其次是半无产阶级，因为一则全无所有，一则有也不多。现在美国操纵联合国的多数票和控制世界很多地方的局面只是暂时的，这个局面总有一天要起变化。中国的穷国地位和在国际上无权的地位也会起变化，穷国将变为富国，无权将变为有权——向相反的方向转化。在这里，决定的条件就是社会主义制度和人民团结一致的奋斗。”
    一九五○年六月二十八日，当美国帝国主义公然发动侵略朝鲜的战争和武装侵略我国领土台湾的时候，毛泽东同志在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上的讲话里说：
    “中国人民早已声明，全世界各国的事务应由各国人民自己来管，亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管，而不应由美国来管。美国对亚洲的侵略，只能引起亚洲人民广泛的和坚决的反抗。杜鲁门在今年一月五日还声明说美国不干涉台湾，现在他自己证明了那是假的，并且同时撕毁了美国关于不干涉中国内政的一切国际协议。美国这样地暴露了自己的帝国主义面目，这对于中国和亚洲人民很有利益。美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的，全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，而决不会站在美帝国主义方面。他们将既不受帝国主义的利诱，也不怕帝国主义的威胁。帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”
    一九五五年二月十四日，毛泽东同志在苏联驻我国大使馆庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签定五周年举行的招待会上指出：
    “在我们中苏两个伟大的国家的合作之下，我相信，帝国主义的侵略计划是要被粉碎的。
    “我们大家可以看到，在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
    一九五八年九月八日，毛泽东同志在最高国务会议上说：
    “目前的形势对全世界争取和平的人民有利。”
    “总的趋势是东风压倒西风。”
    “美帝国主义九年来侵占了我国领土台湾，不久以前又派遣它的武装部队侵占了黎巴嫩。美国在全世界许多国家建立了几百个军事基地。中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”
    “美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”
    “美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    一九五八年九月二十九日，毛泽东同志在巡视长江流域的几个省以后回到了北京。他在向新华社记者发表的谈话里说：
    “帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。但是帝国主义者目前还是在活着，他们依然在向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道。他们在西方世界也依然在压迫他们本国的人民群众。这种局面必需改变。结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”
    “一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    一九五七年十一月六日，毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年会议上的讲话中说：
    “社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。难道沙皇和蒋介石对于革命人民的种种迫害，不就是对于伟大的俄国革命和伟大的中国革命起了这样的促进作用吗？”
    一九四○年二月二十日，毛泽东同志在延安宪政促进会发表的题名为“新民主主义的宪政”的演说中，揭穿了蒋介石的所谓实行宪政的欺骗宣传，说明反动派所得的结果，“总是和他们的愿望相反”：
    “天下的顽固分子，他们虽然今天顽固，明天顽固，后天也顽固，但是不能永远地顽固下去，到了后来，他们就要变了。比方汪精卫，他顽固了许多时候，就不能再在抗日地盘上逞顽固，只好跑到日本怀里去了。比方张国焘，他也顽固了许多时候，我们就开了几次斗争会，七斗八斗，他也溜了。顽固分子，实际上是顽而不固，顽到后来，就要变，变为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。也有变好了的，也是由于斗，七斗八斗，他认错了，就变好了。总之顽固派是要起变化的。顽固派，他们总有一套计划，其计划是如何损人利己以及如何装两面派之类。但是从来的顽固派，所得的结果，总是和他们的愿望相反。他们总是以损人开始，以害己告终。我们曾说张伯伦‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，现在已经应验了。张伯伦过去一心一意想的是搬起希特勒这块石头，去打苏联人民的脚，但是，从去年九月德国和英法的战争爆发的一天起，张伯伦手上的石头却打到张伯伦自己的脚上了。一直到现在，这块石头，还是继续在打张伯伦哩。中国的故事也很多。袁世凯想打老百姓的脚，结果打了他自己，做了几个月的皇帝就死了。段祺瑞、徐世昌、曹锟、吴佩孚等等，他们都想镇压人民，但是结果都被人民推翻。凡有损人利己之心的人，其结果都不妙。”
    一九四五年四月二十四日，毛泽东同志在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上作了著名的政治报告“论联合政府”。在这个报告的“我们的具体纲领”部分，毛泽东同志对国民党反动派企图用召开“国民大会”来进行反人民的阴谋活动提出警告，预言实行这个反动方针是“他们准备把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上”，是把自己推上绝路。毛泽东同志说：
    “我们的反人民的英雄们根据这种分裂方针所准备采取的步骤，有把他们自己推到绝路上去的危险。他们准备把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上，并且让它永远也解不开，这条绳索的名称就叫做‘国民大会’。他们的原意是想把所谓‘国民大会’当作法宝，祭起来，一则抵制联合政府，二则维持独裁统治，三则准备内战理由。可是，历史的逻辑将向他们所设想的反面走去，‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    一九四五年七月十二日，毛泽东同志在为新华社写的“评赫尔利政策的危险” 的评论中，指出美国的对华政策造成了中国的内战危机，并且警告美国这种同中国人民为敌的政策将给美国政府和人民带来“无穷祸害”：
    “在同一个赫尔利的嘴里，以蒋介石为代表的国民党政府变成了美人，而中共则变成了魔怪；并且他率直地宣称：美国只同蒋介石合作，不同中共合作。当然这不只是赫尔利个人的意见，而是美国政府中的一群人的意见，但这是错误的而且危险的意见。……假如赫尔利政策继续下去，美国政府便将陷在中国反动派的又臭又深的粪坑里拔不出脚来，把它自己放在已经觉醒和正在继续觉醒的几万万中国人民的敌对方面，在目前，妨碍抗日战争，在将来，妨碍世界和平。……可以确定地说的，就是赞助中国反人民势力和以如此广大的中国人民为敌的这个赫尔利式的政策，如果继续不变的话，那就将给美国政府和美国人民以千钧重负和无穷祸害，这一点，必须使美国人民认识清楚。”
    毛泽东同志一九四五年六月十一日在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会上所作的闭幕词“愚公移山”中说：
    “美国政府的扶蒋反共政策，说明了美国反动派的猖狂。但是一切中外反动派的阻止中国人民胜利的企图，都是注定要失败的。现在的世界潮流，民主是主流，反民主的反动只是一股逆流。目前反动的逆流企图压倒民族独立和人民民主的主流，但反动的逆流终究不会变为主流。”
      反动派一定要倒台，革命一定要胜利。毛泽东同志在中国共产党第七次全国代表大会的闭幕词里，号召人民要建立起革命必胜的信心。他引用“愚公移山”这个中国古代的寓言，说明只要革命的人们有了信心，不畏惧反动派，有了决心，坚持奋斗到底，革命没有不胜利的：
    “我们宣传大会的路线，就是要使全党和全国人民建立起一个信心，即革命一定要胜利。首先要使先锋队觉悟，下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。但这还不够，还必须使全国广大人民群众觉悟，甘心情愿和我们一起奋斗，去争取胜利。要使全国人民有这样的信心：中国是中国人民的，不是反动派的。中国古代有个寓言，叫做‘愚公移山’。说的是古代有一位老人，住在华北，名叫北山愚公。他的家门南面有两座大山挡住他家的出路，一座叫做太行山，一座叫做王屋山。愚公下决心率领他的儿子们要用锄头挖去这两座大山。有个老头子名叫智叟的看了发笑，说是你们这样干未免太愚蠢了，你们父子数人要挖掉这样两座大山是完全不可能的。愚公回答说：我死了以后有我的儿子，儿子死了，又有孙子，子子孙孙是没有穷尽的。这两座山虽然很高，却是不会再增高了，挖一点就会少一点，为什么挖不平呢？愚公批驳了智叟的错误思想，毫不动摇，每天挖山不止。这件事感动了上帝，他就派了两个神仙下凡，把两座山背走了。现在也有两座压在中国人民头上的大山，一座叫做帝国主义，一座叫做封建主义。中国共产党早就下了决心，要挖掉这两座山。我们一定要坚持下去，一定要不断地工作，我们也会感动上帝的。这个上帝不是别人，就是全中国的人民大众。全国人民大众一齐起来和我们一道挖这两座山，有什么挖不平呢？”
    一九四九年八月十一日，毛泽东同志在为新华社写的“评白皮书”的评论中，非常精辟地论述了反动力量和人民力量极端不同的两种发展逻辑；并且指出，先进的人们必须组织力量同反动派进行斗争，必须教育、团结和争取一切还在动摇犹豫着的人们，使反动派完全孤立：
    “帝国主义者的逻辑和人民的逻辑是这样的不同。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。
    “斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。俄国人民的革命曾经是依照了这条定律，中国人民的革命也是依照这条定律。
    “阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。
    “自我批评的方法只能用于人民的内部，希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，例如我们的人民解放战争，土地革命，揭露帝国主义，‘刺激’他们，把他们打倒，制裁他们的犯法行为，‘只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动’。然后，才有希望在平等和互利的条件下和外国帝国主义国家打交道。然后，才有希望把已经缴械了的和投降了的地主阶级分子、官僚资产阶级分子和国民党反动派及其帮凶们给以由坏人变好人的教育，并尽可能地把他们变成好人。中国的许多自由主义分子，亦即旧民主主义分子，亦即杜鲁门、马歇尔、艾奇逊、司徒雷登们所属望的和经常企图争取的所谓‘民主个人主义’的拥护者们之所以往往陷入被动地位，对问题的观察往往不正确——对美国统治者的观察往往不正确，对国民党的观察往往不正确，对苏联的观察往往不正确，对中国共产党的观察也往往不正确，就是因为他们没有或不赞成用历史唯物主义的观点去看问题的缘故。
    “先进的人们，共产党人，各民主党派，觉悟了的工人，青年学生，进步的知识分子，有责任去团结人民中国内部的中间阶层、中间派、各阶层中的落后分子、一切还在动摇犹豫着的人们（这些人们还要长期地动摇着，坚定了又动摇，一遇困难就要动摇的），用善意去帮助他们，批评他们的动摇性，教育他们，争取他们站到人民大众方面来，不让帝国主义把他们拉过去，叫他们丢掉幻想，准备斗争。不要以为胜利了，就不要做工作了。还要做工作，还要做很多的耐心的工作，才能真正地争取这些人。争取了他们，帝国主义就完全孤立了，艾奇逊的一套就无所施其伎了。”二
    一九四二年十月十二日，毛泽东同志在为延安“解放日报”写的社论“第二次世界大战的转折点”里，分析了反动势力外强中干的实质，提醒革命的人们不要为表面的现象所迷惑。毛泽东同志写道：
    “在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的，而有些革命的人们也往往在一个期间内被这种外强中干的现象所迷惑，看不出敌人快要消灭，自己快要胜利的实质。整个法西斯势力的兴起及其进行了几年的侵略战争，正是这种最后挣扎的表现；而在战争中，又以攻击斯大林格勒表现它自己的最后挣扎。在这个历史的转折点面前，全世界反法西斯阵线内的人们也有许多被法西斯的凶恶面孔所迷惑，看不出它的实质。”
    反动派总是吹嘘自己的貌似强大的武力。在人民中间，也有一部分人对于反动派的军事力量存在着不同程度的畏惧心理。这是“唯武器论”的观点。毛泽东同志在一九三八年五月所写的著名论文“论持久战”里，对于这种观点作了深刻的批评：
    “所谓‘唯武器论’，是战争问题中的机械论，是主观地和片面地看问题的意见。我们的意见与此相反，不但看到武器，而且看到人力。武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。力量对比不但是军力和经济力的对比，而且是人力和人心的对比。军力和经济力是要人去掌握的。”
    一九四六年八月，毛泽东同志在延安接见美国记者安娜·路易斯·斯特朗，发表了关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的著名论点。下面是这个谈话的全文：
    “斯问：你觉得中国的问题在不久的将来有政治解决、和平解决的希望没有？
    “毛答：这要看美国政府的态度。如果美国人民拖住了帮助蒋介石打内战的美国反动派的手的话，和平是有希望的。
    “问：如果美国除了它所已经给的以外不再帮助了，那末蒋介石还可以打多久？
    “答：一年以上。
    “问：蒋介石在经济上可能支持那样久吗？
    “答：可以的。
    “问：如果美国说明此后不再给蒋介石以什么帮助了呢？
    “答：在现时还没有什么征象表示美国政府和蒋介石有任何在短时期内停止战争的愿望。
    “问：共产党能支持多久？
    “答：就我们自己的愿望说，我们连一天也不愿意打。但是如果形势迫使我们不得不打的话，我们是能够一直打到底的。
    “问：如果美国人民问到共产党为什么作战，我该怎样回答呢？
    “答：因为蒋介石要屠杀中国人民，人民要生存就必须自卫。这是美国人所能够理解的。
    “问：你对于美国是否可能举行反苏战争如何看法？
    “答：关于反苏战争的宣传，包括两个方面。在一方面，美国帝国主义确是在准备着反苏战争的，目前的反苏战争宣传和其他的反苏宣传就是对于反苏战争的政治准备；在另一方面，这种宣传是美国反动派用以掩盖当前美国帝国主义所直接面对着的许多实际矛盾所放的烟幕。这些矛盾就是美国反动派同美国人民之间的矛盾，以及美国帝国主义同其他资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家之间的矛盾。美国反苏战争的口号在目前的实际意义是压迫美国人民和向资本主义世界扩张它的侵略势力。你知道，希特勒和他的伙伴日本军阀在一个长时期中都曾经把反苏的口号作为奴役本国人民和侵略其他国家的托辞，现在美国反动派的做法也正是这样。
    “美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。他们已经在进攻美国人民了，他们从政治上、经济上压迫美国的工人和民主分子，准备在美国实行法西斯主义。美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻，我相信他们是会这样做的。
    “美国和苏联中间隔着极其辽阔的地带，这里有欧、亚、非三洲的许多资本主义国家和殖民地、半殖民地国家，美国反动派在没有压服这些国家之前，是谈不到进攻苏联的。现在美国在太平洋控制了比英国过去的全部势力范围还要多的地方，它控制着日本、国民党统治的中国、半个朝鲜和南太平洋；它早已控制着中南美；它还想控制整个大英帝国和西欧。美国在各种借口之下，在许多国家进行大规模的军事布置，建立军事基地。美国反动派说，他们在世界各地已经建立和准备建立的一切海军基地，都是为着反对苏联的。不错，这些军事基地是指向苏联。但是，在现时，首先受到美国侵略的不是苏联，而是这些被建立军事基地的国家。我相信，不要很久，这些国家将会认识到真正压迫它们的是谁，是苏联还是美国。美国反动派终有一天将会发现他们自己是处在了全世界人民的反对中。
    “当然，我不是说，美国反动派不想进攻苏联。苏联是世界和平的保卫者，是阻碍美国反动派建立世界霸权的强大的因素，有了苏联，美国和世界反动派的野心就根本不能实现；因此，美国反动派非常痛恨苏联，确实梦想消灭这个社会主义国家。但是在目前，在第二次世界大战结束不久的时候，美国反动派如此大吹大擂地强调美苏战争，闹得乌烟瘴气，就使人不能不来看看他们的实际目的。原来他们是在反苏的口号下面，疯狂地进攻美国的工人和民主分子，和把美国向外扩张的一切对象国都变成美国的附属物。我以为美国人民和一切受到美国侵略威胁的国家的人民，应当团结起来，反对美国反动派及其在各国的走狗的进攻。只有这个斗争胜利了，第三次世界大战才可以避免，否则是不能避免的。
    “问：这是一个很好的说明。但是如果美国使用原子炸弹呢？如果美国从冰岛、冲绳岛以及中国的基地轰炸苏联呢？
    “答：原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。当然原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎，看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。在一九一七年俄国二月革命以前，俄国国内究竟那一方面拥有真正的力量呢？从表面上看，当时的沙皇是有力量的；但是二月革命的一阵风，就把沙皇吹走了。归根结蒂，俄国的力量是在工农兵苏维埃这方面。沙皇不过是一只纸老虎。希特勒不是曾经被人们看作很有力量的吗？但是历史证明了他是一只纸老虎。墨索里尼也是如此，日本帝国主义也是如此。相反的，苏联以及各国爱好民主自由的人民的力量，却是比人们所预料的强大得多。
    “蒋介石和他的支持者美国反动派也都是纸老虎。提起美国帝国主义，人们似乎觉得它是强大得不得了的，中国的反动派正在拿美国的‘强大’来吓唬中国人民。但是美国反动派也将要同一切历史上的反动派一样，被证明为并没有什么力量。在美国，另有一类人是真正有力量的，这就是美国人民。
    “拿中国的情形来说，我们所依靠的不过是小米加步枪，但是历史最后将证明，这小米加步枪比蒋介石的飞机加坦克还要强些。虽然在中国人民面前还存在着许多困难，中国人民在美国帝国主义和中国反动派的联合进攻之下，将要受到长时间的苦难，但是这些反动派总有一天要失败，我们总有一天要胜利。这原因不是别的，就在于反动派代表反动，而我们代表进步。”
    一九四七年十二月二十五日，毛泽东同志在中共中央会议上作了“目前形势和我们的任务”的报告。在这个报告里，毛泽东同志说：
    “中国共产党依据马克思列宁主义的科学，清醒地估计了国际与国内的形势，知道一切内外反动派的进攻不但是必须打败的，而且是能够打败的。当着天空中似乎是黑暗的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，暴风雨即将过去，曙光即在前头。当着一九四六年七月，蒋介石匪帮发动全国规模的反革命战争的时候，蒋介石匪帮认为，只须三个月至六个月，就可以打败人民解放军。他们认为他们有正规军二百万，非正规军一百余万，后方军事机关及部队一百余万，共有军事力量四百余万人；他们已经利用时间完成了进攻的准备；他们重新控制了大城市；他们拥有三万万以上的人口；他们接收了日本侵华军队一百万人的全部装备；他们取得了美国政府在军事上与财政上的重大援助。他们又认为，中国人民解放军在八年抗日战争中已经打得很疲倦，而且在数量上与装备上远不及国民党军队；中国解放区还只有一万万多一点的人口（编者按：当时的人口调查不确实，一般认为全国只有四亿五千万人，解放以后经过确实调查，中国人口有六万万），其中大部分地区的反动封建势力还没有被肃清，土地改革还不普遍与不彻底，人民解放军的后方还不是巩固的。在这些基础上，蒋介石匪帮就不顾中国人民的和平愿望，最后地撕毁在一九四六年一月间签订的国共两党的停战协定及各党派政治协商会议的决议，发动了冒险的战争。那时我们说，敌人军事力量的优势，这只是暂时的现象，这只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；而蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。十八个月战争的经验，充分地证明了我们的论断。
    …………
    “蒋介石反动集团在一九四六年发动全国规模的反人民的国内战争的时候，他们之所以敢于冒险，不但依靠他们自己的优势的军事力量，而且主要地依靠他们认为是异常强大的、举世无敌的、手里拿着原子弹的美国帝国主义，一方面，以为美国帝国主义能够像流水一样地供给他们以军事上与财政上的需要；另一方面，狂妄地设想所谓‘美苏必战’，所谓‘第三次世界大战必然爆发’。这种对于美国帝国主义的依赖，是第二次世界大战结束以后全世界各国反动势力的共同特点。这件事，反映了第二次世界大战给予世界资本主义的打击的严重性，反映了各国反动派力量的薄弱及其心理的恐慌与丧失信心，反映了全世界革命力量的强大，使得各国反动派除了依靠美国帝国主义的援助就感到毫无出路。但是，在实际上，在第二次世界大战以后的美国帝国主义，是否真如蒋介石及各国反动派所设想的那么强大呢？是否真能像流水一样的从美国接济蒋介石及各国反动派呢？并不如此。美国帝国主义在第二次世界大战期间所增强起来的经济力量，遇着了不稳定的日趋缩小的国内市场与国际市场。这种市场的进一步缩小，就要引起经济危机的爆发。美国的战争景气，仅仅是一时的现象。它的强大，只是表面的与暂时的。危机就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。这种情况，迫使美国帝国主义分子建立了奴役世界的计划，像野兽一样，向欧、亚两洲及其他地方乱窜，集合各国的反动势力，那些被人民唾弃的渣滓，组成帝国主义及反民主的阵营，反对以苏联为首的一切民主势力，准备战争，企图在将来，在遥远的时间内，有一天发动第三次世界大战打败民主力量。这是一个狂妄的计划。全世界民主势力必须打败这个计划，也完全能够打败它。全世界反帝国主义阵营的力量超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。优势是在我们方面，不是在敌人方面。”
    一九四八年十一月，毛泽东同志在给“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”杂志所写的论文“全世界革命力量团结起来，反对帝国主义的侵略”里指出，“对于敌人力量的过高估计和对于革命力量估计不足，将是一个极大的错误”：
    “第二次世界大战胜利以后，代替德意日法西斯的地位而疯狂地准备着新的世界战争、威胁全世界的美国帝国主义及其在各国的走狗们，反映了资本主义世界的极端腐败及其濒于灭亡的恐怖情绪。这个敌人还是有力量的，因此，每一个国家内部的一切革命力量必须团结起来，一切国家的革命力量必须团结起来，必须组成以苏联为首的反对帝国主义的统一战线，并遵循正确的政策，否则就不能胜利。这个敌人的基础是虚弱的，它的内部分崩离析，它脱离人民，它有无法解脱的经济危机，因此，它是能够被战胜的。对于敌人力量的过高估计和对于革命力量的估计不足，将是一个极大的错误。”
    一九四八年一月十八日，毛泽东同志在为中共中央写的对党内的指示“关于目前党的政策中的几个重要问题”里告诉我们，在全体上，在战略上，要轻视敌人，同时又要讲究斗争艺术，在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，又要重视敌人：
    “反对对敌人的力量估计过高。例如，惧怕美帝国主义，惧怕到国民党区域作战，惧怕消灭买办封建制度、分配地主土地和没收官僚资本，惧怕长期战争等。这些都是不正确的。全世界资本主义和中国蒋介石反动集团的统治，已经腐烂，没有前途。我们有理由轻视它们。我们有把握、有信心战胜中国人民的一切内外敌人。但是在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上（不论是在军事的、政治的、经济的、或思想的斗争上），却又决不可轻视敌人，相反，应当重视敌人，集中全力作战，方能取得胜利。当着我们正确地指出在全体上，在战略上，应当轻视敌人的时候，却决不可在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，也轻视敌人。如果我们在全体上过高估计敌人力量，因而不敢推翻他们，不敢胜利，我们就要犯右倾机会主义错误。如果我们在每一个局部上，在每一个具体斗争上，不采取谨慎态度，不讲究斗争艺术，不集中全力作战，不注意争取一切应当争取的同盟者（中农，独立工商业者，中产阶级，学生、教员、教授和一般知识分子，一般公务人员，自由职业者和开明绅士），我们就要犯‘左’倾机会主义错误。”
    一九五七年十一月十八日，毛泽东同志在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议上的发言里说：
    “一九四六年蒋介石开始向我们进攻的时候，我们许多同志，全国人民，都很忧虑：战争是不是能够打赢？我本人也忧虑这件事。但是我们有一条信心。那时有一个美国记者到了延安，名字叫安娜·路易斯·斯特朗。我同她谈话的时候谈了许多问题，蒋介石、希特勒、日本、美国、原子弹等等。我说一切所有号称强大的反动派统统不过是纸老虎。原因是他们脱离人民。你看，希特勒是不是纸老虎？希特勒不是被打倒了吗？我也谈到沙皇是纸老虎，中国皇帝是纸老虎，日本帝国主义是纸老虎，你看，都倒了。美帝国主义没有倒，还有原子弹，我看也是要倒的，也是纸老虎。蒋介石很强大，有四百多万正规军。那时我们在延安。延安这个地方有多少人？有七千人。我们有多少军队呢？我们有九十万游击队，统统被蒋介石分割成几十个根据地。但是我们说，蒋介石不过是一个纸老虎，我们一定会打赢他。为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。也就是说在整体上我们一定要藐视它，在一个一个的具体问题上我们一定要重视它。如果不是在整体上藐视敌人，我们就要犯机会主义的错误。马克思、恩格斯只有两个人，那时他们就说全世界资本主义要被打倒。但是在具体问题上，在一个一个敌人的问题上，如果我们不重视它，我们就要犯冒险主义的错误。打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。工厂只能一个一个地盖，农民犁田只能一块一块地犁，就是吃饭也是如此。我们在战略上藐视吃饭：这顿饭我们能够吃下去。但是具体地吃，却是一口口地吃的，你不可能把一桌酒席一口吞下去。这叫做各个解决，军事书上叫做各个击破。”
    三
    一九五七年十一月十八日，毛泽东同志在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议上的发言里，分析了当前的世界形势，指出现在是社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，东风压倒了西风：
    “我认为现在国际形势到了一个新的转折点。世界上现在有两股风：东风，西风。中国有句成语：‘不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风。’我认为目前形势的特点是东风压倒西风，也就是说，社会主义的力量对于帝国主义的力量占了压倒的优势。”
    在这个发言的前一天，即十一月十七日，毛泽东同志在对我国留苏学生的讲话中说：
    “世界的风向变了。社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营之间的斗争不是西风压倒东风，就是东风压倒西风。现在全世界共有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立以及带有中立倾向的资本主义国家人口有六亿，帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。那里会发生‘地震’。现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。”
    一九五七年十一月六日，毛泽东同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝十月革命四十周年会议上的讲话中说：
    “帝国主义除了把自己的命运寄托在对国内人民和殖民地半殖民地人民的迫害以外，还指望着战争。但是他们能够从战争中指望什么呢？半个世纪以来，我们已经经历过两次世界大战。第一次世界大战之后，在俄国出现了伟大的十月社会主义革命。第二次世界大战之后，在东欧和东方出现了更多的革命。如果帝国主义好汉们决心发动第三次世界大战，他们除了促使世界资本主义制度根本灭亡以外，不会得到什么别的结果。”
    一九五七年二月二十七日，毛泽东同志在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上，作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。他在这篇讲演的第十部分“坏事能否变成好事？”里说：
    “现在世界各国的人们都在谈论着会不会打第三次世界大战。对于这个问题，我们也要有精神准备，也要有分析。我们是坚持和平反对战争的。但是，如果帝国主义一定要发动战争，我们也不要害怕。我们对待这个问题的态度，同对待一切‘乱子’的态度一样，第一条，反对；第二条，不怕。第一次世界大战以后，出了一个苏联，两亿人口。第二次世界大战以后，出了一个社会主义阵营，一共九亿人口。如果帝国主义者一定要发动第三次世界大战，可以断定，其结果必定又要有多少亿人口转到社会主义方面，帝国主义剩下的地盘就不多了，也有可能整个帝国主义制度全部崩溃。
    “矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。世界上最愿意改变自己地位的是无产阶级，其次是半无产阶级，因为一则全无所有，一则有也不多。现在美国操纵联合国的多数票和控制世界很多地方的局面只是暂时的，这个局面总有一天要起变化。中国的穷国地位和在国际上无权的地位也会起变化，穷国将变为富国，无权将变为有权——向相反的方向转化。在这里，决定的条件就是社会主义制度和人民团结一致的奋斗。”
    一九五○年六月二十八日，当美国帝国主义公然发动侵略朝鲜的战争和武装侵略我国领土台湾的时候，毛泽东同志在中央人民政府委员会第八次会议上的讲话里说：
    “中国人民早已声明，全世界各国的事务应由各国人民自己来管，亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管，而不应由美国来管。美国对亚洲的侵略，只能引起亚洲人民广泛的和坚决的反抗。杜鲁门在今年一月五日还声明说美国不干涉台湾，现在他自己证明了那是假的，并且同时撕毁了美国关于不干涉中国内政的一切国际协议。美国这样地暴露了自己的帝国主义面目，这对于中国和亚洲人民很有利益。美国对朝鲜、菲律宾、越南等国内政的干涉，是完全没有道理的，全中国人民的同情和全世界广大人民的同情都将站在被侵略者方面，而决不会站在美帝国主义方面。他们将既不受帝国主义的利诱，也不怕帝国主义的威胁。帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”
    一九五五年二月十四日，毛泽东同志在苏联驻我国大使馆庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签定五周年举行的招待会上指出：
    “在我们中苏两个伟大的国家的合作之下，我相信，帝国主义的侵略计划是要被粉碎的。
    “我们大家可以看到，在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
    一九五八年九月八日，毛泽东同志在最高国务会议上说：
    “目前的形势对全世界争取和平的人民有利。”
    “总的趋势是东风压倒西风。”
    “美帝国主义九年来侵占了我国领土台湾，不久以前又派遣它的武装部队侵占了黎巴嫩。美国在全世界许多国家建立了几百个军事基地。中国领土台湾、黎巴嫩以及所有美国在外国的军事基地，都是套在美帝国主义脖子上的绞索。不是别人而是美国人自己制造这种绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了中国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界一切爱和平反侵略的人民。美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”
    “美帝国主义在全世界到处制造紧张局势，以期达到它侵略和奴役各国人民的目的。美帝国主义自以为紧张局势总是对它自己有利，但是事实是，美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”
    “美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    一九五八年九月二十九日，毛泽东同志在巡视长江流域的几个省以后回到了北京。他在向新华社记者发表的谈话里说：
    “帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事，专门扶植各国反人民的反动派，霸占大量的殖民地、半殖民地和军事基地，以原子战争威胁和平。这样，他们就迫使全世界百分之九十以上的人正在或者将要对他们群起而攻之。但是帝国主义者目前还是在活着，他们依然在向亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲横行霸道。他们在西方世界也依然在压迫他们本国的人民群众。这种局面必需改变。结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”
