    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 18th: Nicosia dispatch: The Cypriot newspaper "Dawn" published a commentary on October 10th, criticizing the United States' provocative policy in the Far East.

    The commentary stated that Dulles' policy toward the Far East has caused widespread agitation. The United States government is truly facing the danger of being isolated for the first time. Its more loyal allies have expressed impatience, while neutral countries have clearly pointed out that justice is on the side of the People's China and demanded that the United States stop interfering in Far Eastern affairs. The United States does not agree to withdraw its troops from the Taiwan area. This attitude is unacceptable to the People's China, which cannot allow aggressors to obstruct it from liberating its own territory.

    塞浦路斯“黎明报”
    斥美国向我国挑衅
    据新华社布拉格18日电　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯报纸“黎明报”10月10日发表评论，抨击美国在远东的挑衅政策。
    评论写道，杜勒斯对远东的政策引起了普遍的激动。美国政府第一次真正面临着陷于孤立的危险，它的比较忠实的盟友表示不耐烦，中立国家则明确指出正义在人民中国这一边，并且要求美国停止干涉远东问题。美国不同意从台湾地区撤军。这种态度是人民中国所不能容许的，人民中国不能同意侵略者来阻挠它解放自己的领土。
