Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: The memorandum issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on October 2nd to the Soviet government once again demonstrates that the Nobusuke Kishi government is willing to act as an accomplice to the United States' aggression and war policies in the Far East. This memorandum shamelessly reverses black and white, claiming that the United States' frantic war provocations and expanded aggression in the Taiwan Strait area are not "aggression," but that the "crisis" there was "caused" by China. The memorandum states: "Given the fact that this crisis was caused by the use of force by the Communist Chinese army, the assertion that the actions taken by the United States in the Taiwan Strait are acts of aggression is unfounded."

The Nobusuke Kishi government's memorandum, which openly defends American aggression and blatantly antagonizes the Chinese people, is a response to the Soviet government's memorandum to the Nobusuke Kishi government on September 16 of this year. The Soviet government's memorandum sternly pointed out that the series of dangerous actions taken by the United States government in the Taiwan area against the People's Republic of China have intensified the situation in the Far East and seriously threatened world peace. The Soviet government demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government take appropriate measures to prevent the United States armed forces from using Japanese territory to carry out acts of aggression. However, the Nobusuke Kishi government's memorandum not only failed to propose any measures to prevent the United States armed forces from directly using Japanese territory to carry out its provocations and acts of aggression against China, but instead openly sided with the United States, attempting to justify the universally known fact that the United States is expanding its aggression against China.

In the memorandum, the Nobusuke Kishi government also cleverly imitated the rhetoric of the United States, deliberately confusing China's act of exercising sovereignty by liberating its own territory with the issue of the Far Eastern tension caused by the United States' occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and the expansion of its aggression against China, saying that "in the current delicate international situation of confrontation between the East and West camps," "the use of violent methods to resolve disputes should be absolutely avoided." Clearly, the Nobusuke Kishi government's parroting of the United States is drumming up support for the United States' absurd "ceasefire" proposal.

### 无耻颠倒黑白　一副帮凶嘴脸  岸政府又对我国大肆诬蔑

    无耻颠倒黑白　一副帮凶嘴脸
    岸政府又对我国大肆诬蔑
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本外务省10月2日发表的它给苏联政府的一份备忘录，再次表明岸信介政府甘心充当美国在远东的侵略和战争政策的帮凶。这份备忘录无耻地颠倒黑白，说什么美国在台湾海峡地区疯狂地进行战争挑衅和扩大侵略的行动并不是“侵略”，而那里的“危机”倒是中国“引起”的。备忘录说：“从这次危机是共产党中国军队使用武力所引起的事实看来，硬说美国在台湾海峡方面所采取的行动是侵略行动这种说法是没有根据的。”
    岸信介政府这份公然为美国的侵略进行辩护和露骨地敌视中国人民的备忘录，是对苏联政府今年9月16日给岸信介政府的备忘录的答复。苏联政府的备忘录曾经严正指出，美国政府在台湾地区对中华人民共和国所进行的一系列的挑衅的危险行动使远东局势尖锐化，并且使世界和平受到严重威胁。苏联政府要求岸信介政府采取适当方法防止美国武装力量利用日本领土来进行侵略行动。但是，岸信介政府的这份备忘录不但没有提出如何防止美国武装力量直接利用日本领土来对中国进行它的挑衅和侵略行动的办法，反而公开站在美国方面，为美国扩大对中国的侵略这一人所共知的事实进行狡辩。
    岸信介政府在备忘录中还维妙维肖地模仿美国的论调，故意地把中国解放自己领土的这一行使主权的行动同美国霸占中国领土台湾和扩大对中国的侵略所引起的远东紧张局势问题混淆起来，说什么“在目前东西两阵营对立的微妙的国际形势下”，“应该绝对避免”“以暴力的方法来解决争端”。显然地，岸信介政府这种同美国一个鼻孔出气的说法，是在为美国荒谬的“停火”主张摇旗呐喊。
