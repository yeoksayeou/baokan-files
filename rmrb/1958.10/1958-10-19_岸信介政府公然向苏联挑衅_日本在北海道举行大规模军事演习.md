Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th dispatch: The Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" Northern Command Headquarters, under the pretext of "northern defense," began large-scale military exercises in Hokkaido on the morning of the 17th. More than 20,000 soldiers participated in the exercises, along with 4,000 various military vehicles and a large number of aircraft and warships.

This is the largest joint army, navy, and air force exercise held in Hokkaido in the process of the Kishida Nobusuke government's accelerating revival of Japanese militarism. The exercise is scheduled to end on October 22.

According to earlier reports in the "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper, this military provocation by the Kishida Nobusuke government against the Soviet Union has aroused opposition from the people of Hokkaido. The trade union councils and other organizations in the Nemuro, Kushiro, and Teshikaga districts of eastern Hokkaido pointed out that this exercise is a provocation against the Soviet Union and a coordination with the US war provocation against China. Therefore, these groups have established a "Countermeasures Committee Against Self-Defense Forces Autumn Maneuver Exercises" and launched a campaign against the military exercises. The All-Hokkaido Trade Union Council and the Hokkaido Peace Movement Council have also expressed opposition to the military exercises.

The Kishida Nobusuke government originally planned to hold naval and air combat exercises on the Nemuro sea off the coast of Hokkaido, but was forced to change it to "mobile exercises" due to the firm opposition of fishermen in the Nemuro area. Fishermen in the Nemuro area firmly demanded that the Kishida Nobusuke government stop provoking the Soviet Union and demanded an early conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

    岸信介政府公然向苏联挑衅
    日本在北海道举行大规模军事演习
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本“自卫队”北部方面总监部假借为了“北方的防务”的名义，17日上午在北海道开始举行大规模的军事演习。参加演习的有陆军二万多人，此外还有四千辆各种军用车辆以及大量的飞机和军舰。
    这是岸信介政府在加紧复活日本军国主义过程中在北海道所举行的规模最大的陆海空军联合演习。这次演习预定10月22日结束。
    据“赤旗报”前些时候报道，岸信介政府这一针对苏联的军事挑衅已经引起北海道人民的反对。北海道东部的根室、钏路、弟子屈各地区工会协议会等团体指出，这次演习是对苏联的挑衅，是同美国对中国的战争挑衅的配合。因此，这些团体设立了“反对自卫队秋季机动演习对策委员会”，展开了反对军事演习的运动。全北海道工会协议会和北海道和平运动协议会也表示反对军事演习。
    岸信介政府原来还准备在北海道的根室海面上举行海战和空战演习，由于根室地区的渔民坚决反对，才被迫改为“机动演习”。根室地区的渔民坚决要求岸信介政府停止对苏联的挑衅，并且要求早日同苏联缔结和约。
