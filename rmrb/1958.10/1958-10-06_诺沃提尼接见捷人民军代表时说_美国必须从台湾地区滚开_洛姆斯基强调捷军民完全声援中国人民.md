Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 4th: On October 6th, it is the anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak People's Army. President Novotný received a delegation from the Czechoslovak People's Army, headed by Minister of National Defense Lomský, on the 4th. When discussing the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, he pointed out that the cause of the People's Republic of China is just, and therefore, the American imperialists will have to get out of Taiwan and the Chinese coastal islands sooner or later.

President Novotný said that since the Munich incident, the policy of imperialism has not changed. Just as they sacrificed the freedom of the people of various countries and prepared for war twenty years ago, they are now keeping the world in a constant state of tension, constantly creating dangerous hotbeds of war, as demonstrated by the current situation in the Middle East and the Taiwan region. He said, however, that the imperialists will gain nothing from carrying out threats.

Tonight, the working people of Prague and the Czechoslovak People's Army held a celebration party in Julius Fučík Park in Prague to celebrate the founding anniversary of the People's Army. Czechoslovak Minister of National Defense Lomský condemned the United States for its provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area and its acts of undermining world peace in his speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the entire people and the People's Army of Czechoslovakia are in complete solidarity with the great Chinese people. They unanimously and firmly support the Czechoslovak government's attitude: expressing full support for the great Chinese people and fully supporting their inalienable right to liberate their own territory.

    诺沃提尼接见捷人民军代表时说
    美国必须从台湾地区滚开
    洛姆斯基强调捷军民完全声援中国人民
    据新华社布拉格4日电　10月6日是捷克斯洛伐克人民军建军节。诺沃提尼总统在4日接见了以国防部长洛姆斯基为首的捷人民军代表团。他在谈到目前台湾海峡地区的局势时指出，中华人民共和国的事业是正义的，因此，美国帝国主义者迟早都得从台湾和中国沿海岛屿滚开。
    诺沃提尼总统说，自从慕尼黑事件以来，帝国主义的政策并没有改变。正如二十年以前他们牺牲各国人民的自由并且准备战争那样，目前他们又使世界保持在不断的紧张局势中，不断制造危险的战争温床，目前中近东和台湾地区的事态就证明了这一点。他说，然而帝国主义者进行威胁的结果是什么也捞不到的。
    今晚，布拉格劳动人民和捷人民军在布拉格的尤利乌斯·伏契克公园举行了庆祝人民军建军节的联欢会。捷克斯洛伐克国防部长洛姆斯基在会上讲话时谴责美国在台湾海峡地区对中国进行挑衅和破坏世界和平的行为。他强调指出，捷克斯洛伐克全体人民和人民军同伟大的中国人民完全团结一致。他们一致坚决支持捷克斯洛伐克政府的这一态度：表示完全声援伟大的中国人民，全力支持他们解放他们自己领土的不可剥夺的权利。
