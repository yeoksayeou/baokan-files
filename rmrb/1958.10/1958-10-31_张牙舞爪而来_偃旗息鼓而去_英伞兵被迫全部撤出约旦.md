Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 30th -- Following the forced complete withdrawal of the American invading forces from Lebanon, the vast majority of the British invading forces have also withdrawn from Jordan. In the five days up to the 29th, the more than three thousand British paratroopers stationed in the Jordanian capital Amman, along with their weapons and equipment, have all been airlifted back to Cyprus. It was from this island in the eastern Mediterranean that the British invading paratroopers invaded Jordan in July of this year.

The commander of the British invading forces in Jordan, Tom Pearson, also left Amman by plane on the 29th.

It is reported that after the complete withdrawal of the British paratroopers, a battalion of the British "Cameronians" remains at the port of Aqaba in southern Jordan, waiting to board ships back to Kenya. The equipment and supplies for this invading force are being transported away by British warships.

The British troops invaded Jordan three days after the victory of the Iraqi revolution, with the aim of maintaining the small Hussein dynasty and seeking an opportunity to cooperate with the American invading forces in Lebanon to attack the Republic of Iraq. However, under the strong protests of the people of the Middle East and the world, this group of British invading troops finally had to furl their banners and leave.

However, it is reported that some British officers still remain in Jordan, serving as "experts" at the Jordanian Army Headquarters. The United States has also sent a military delegation to Jordan, attempting to strengthen its control over Hussein's army.

    张牙舞爪而来　偃旗息鼓而去
    英伞兵被迫全部撤出约旦
    新华社30日讯　安曼消息：继美国侵略军被迫全部撤离黎巴嫩之后，绝大部分的英国侵略军也已经从约旦撤退。到29日为止的五天中，英国在约旦首都安曼的三千多名伞兵连同他们的武器和装备，已经全部被空运回塞浦路斯。今年7月间，英国侵略军伞兵正是从这个东地中海的岛屿侵入约旦的。
    英国侵约军司令托姆·皮尔逊也在29日乘飞机离开安曼。
    据报道，在英国伞兵全部撤出后，还有英国“喀麦隆团”的一个营呆在约旦南部的亚喀巴港，等待乘船返回怯尼亚。这批侵略军的装备和给养正由英国军舰运走。
    英国军队是在伊拉克革命胜利后三天侵入约旦的，目的在于维护侯赛因小王朝，并且伺机配合侵黎美军进攻伊拉克共和国。但是，在中东和世界人民的强烈抗议下，这批英国侵略军队也终于不得不偃旗息鼓而去。
    但是，据报道，目前仍然有一些英国军官留在约旦，充当约旦陆军总部的“专家”。美国也已经派了一个军事代表团到约旦去，企图加强对侯赛因军队的控制。
