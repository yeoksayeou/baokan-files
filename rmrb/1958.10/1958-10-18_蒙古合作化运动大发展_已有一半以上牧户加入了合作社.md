    Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 17th: The livestock cooperative movement in the Mongolian People's Republic is developing at an unprecedented speed. Currently, the number of herdsmen households joining cooperatives has reached 55% of the total number of herdsmen households. Six months ago, only 35% of herdsmen households had joined cooperatives. The number of publicly owned livestock in the cooperatives is also gradually increasing.
    Animal husbandry is the main economic sector of the Mongolian People's Republic, and the livestock cooperative movement has become one of the most important tasks in the pastoral areas. Recently, the Party organizations of various provinces in Mongolia have successively held plenary sessions of the provincial committees, focusing on discussing the development and consolidation of livestock cooperatives since the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party held in March this year.
    It is reported that in many provinces of Mongolia, such as Bulgan, Zavkhan, and Govi-Altai, the number of herdsmen households joining cooperatives has exceeded half of the herdsmen households in each province. The Gobi region, where the development of cooperatives was previously slow, has also accelerated the pace of establishing cooperatives. In East Gobi Province, before March of this year, only 20.8% of the province's herdsmen households had joined cooperatives, accounting for 22% of the livestock; in the past half year, both the number of herdsmen households and livestock joining cooperatives have doubled. Judging from the figures of various provinces, the task of increasing livestock in cooperatives this year has been completed or overfulfilled on average. 74% of the cooperatives in Govi-Altai Province have overfulfilled their livestock increase plans, and the cooperatives have also done a good job in fulfilling the task of paying livestock products to the state.

    蒙古合作化运动大发展
    已有一半以上牧户加入了合作社
    新华社乌兰巴托17日电　蒙古人民共和国的牧业合作化运动正以过去所没有的速度向前发展。目前，加入合作社的牧户已经达到总牧户的55％。而半年前的入社牧户仅占35％。合作社的公有牲畜头数也在逐渐增加。
    畜牧业是蒙古人民共和国的主要经济部门，牧业合作化运动已成为当前牧区的重要工作之一。最近，蒙古各省的党组织先后召开省委会全体会议，着重讨论了自今年3月举行党的第十三次代表大会以来发展和巩固牧业合作社的情况。
    据报道，蒙古的布拉干、扎布汗和戈壁阿尔泰等许多省加入合作社的牧户都已超过各省牧户的一半。过去合作社发展较慢的戈壁地区也加快了建社的速度。东戈壁省在今年3月以前入社的牧户只占全省牧户的20.8％，牲畜占22％；近半年来入社的牧户和牲畜都翻了一番。从各个省的数字看来，今年合作社增殖牲畜的任务平均已经完成或者超额完成。戈壁阿尔泰省有74％的合作社超额完成了增畜计划，合作社向国家缴纳畜产品的任务也完成得很好。
