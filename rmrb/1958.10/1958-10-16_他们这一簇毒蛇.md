This Cluster of Vipers

    In the past two months, the U.S. imperialists have drastically increased the naval, air, and ground forces they have dispatched to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. Units such as Marine Corps, "Nike-Hercules" surface-to-air missile units, air force units piloting various types of aircraft, and some infantry and military police teams have been transferred from U.S. military bases in the U.S. mainland, Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan, and Okinawa to Taiwan. The strength of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which is responsible for armed aggression against Taiwan and military threats against mainland China in and near the Taiwan Strait, has also increased, with a total of more than 140 ships, including six aircraft carriers, and more than 60,000 personnel. U.S. news agencies boast that these U.S. military deployments are "the largest concentration of U.S. military power centered on nuclear weapons in the Far East since World War II."
    The U.S. war maniacs are massively increasing their troops to Taiwan, creating a tense situation in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, which not only seriously threatens world peace but also, due to the endless atrocities of the U.S. aggressor troops, first and foremost inflicts humiliation and disaster on the 9.5 million Chinese people living in Taiwan.
    Before this massive increase of troops to Taiwan by U.S. imperialism, there were already more than 10,000 U.S. military officers and soldiers, causing unrest in various cities and villages in Taiwan. With the recent influx of a large number of U.S. troops, Taiwan is in a state of chaos. In the past two months, countless Taiwanese farmers' farmlands have been occupied by the U.S. military as military bases and restricted areas; tens of thousands of urban and rural residents' houses have been forcibly demolished, and the places where they live have been surrounded by barbed wire by the U.S. aggressor troops, with signs reading "U.S. military area, Chinese are not allowed to enter." Groups of displaced Taiwanese compatriots, victimized by the U.S. aggressors, are dragging their hungry feet and wandering everywhere. Insulting women, drinking, looting, drug trafficking, military vehicle accidents—the U.S. aggressor troops are committing all kinds of evil in Taiwan, oppressing and humiliating our Taiwanese compatriots. The extent of the misbehavior of the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan can also be seen from a United Press International report. This report stated that the U.S. military in Taiwan and Penghu "has little or no military discipline."
    When an American reporter described the life of the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan, he said that the first enemy the U.S. military encountered in Taiwan was snakes, and that the U.S. military discovered many snakes when opening up new military bases in Taiwan. After this feature news was published in the newspaper, a Taiwanese newspaper's supplement published a miscellaneous article, vaguely saying that although snakes are hateful, the Taiwanese people will not be frightened by them; given the opportunity, they certainly know how to kill snakes, no matter where the snakes come from. This is indeed a fable-like miscellaneous article, which expresses the feelings of the vast number of Taiwanese compatriots. Indeed, Taiwanese compatriots regard the U.S. aggressor troops as snakes and beasts. Taiwan is a beautiful treasure island of our country, and it is not a place where snakes and beasts can occupy for long. If they do not return to where they should be as soon as possible, then, when the time comes to take action, these vicious guys who usually cause so much harm will surely be strangled and beaten to death.
    The atrocities of the U.S. aggressor troops in Taiwan are too numerous to mention. Especially in the past two months, in Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Magong Port in Penghu, where U.S. Seventh Fleet ships frequently dock and U.S. sailors frequently come ashore, in Gongguan Township, Miaoli County, central Taiwan, where the U.S. is building an air force base, in Fangliao, Chunrih, Beiqiwei, Nanshihu and other areas in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, where the U.S. Marine Corps conducts exercises, in the area near Taipei where the U.S. is building "Nike-Hercules" surface-to-air missile bases, and in U.S. air force bases scattered throughout Taiwan, the U.S. military is heavily concentrated, causing great harm to the Taiwanese people.
    In Kaohsiung City, an American soldier named Mou Sili (transliteration) dragged a Taiwanese woman named Xie Xiuqin into a jeep, forcibly insulted her, and then threw her out of the speeding car, causing Xie Xiuqin to fracture her wrist and waist, and break her head, bleeding profusely and falling unconscious. In Tainan, a young woman named Shen Nvfang was violently raped by an American soldier. In Keelung City, a middle school girl named Liang Lifen was insulted by American soldiers and resisted desperately. Several American soldiers pushed her into the sea and drowned her. The approximately 4,000 U.S. Marines stationed in southern Taiwan are even more like a pack of mad dogs running around. Currently, the people of southern Taiwan are engaged in sporadic resistance struggles against the U.S. Marines day and night.
    In Taipei City, the political and economic center of Taiwan, the U.S. aggressor troops are just as rampant and domineering. An American soldier set fire to a firecracker shop in Taipei City. The U.S. military headquarters actually said that this was "of a joking nature" and did not pursue the matter. Near the U.S. 63 Club on Yuanshan Zhonglie Road, the U.S. military officers' club on Section 3 of Zhongshan North Road, and the U.S. 13th Air Force Club on Section 4 of Roosevelt Road, near the Grand Hotel in Yuanshan, wherever there are many U.S. troops, the people of Taipei regard it as a haunted area. Women dare to pass by in groups during the day to prevent being insulted by American beast-soldiers.
    In Taiwan, residents near U.S. military areas would rather stay at home than go out easily, which has become a habit. Especially women, they do not go out after dusk unless absolutely necessary, otherwise they will be insulted if they encounter American soldiers, especially American soldiers who have been drinking. During the few days when the U.S. military is paid, residents try to reduce going out as much as possible. However, despite staying at home, Taiwanese compatriots are still often bullied and harassed by the U.S. military. Their windows are often broken by the U.S. military with wine bottles, and the streets are full of the sounds of U.S. military vehicle horns, U.S. military whistles, and wild shouts. Incidents of American beast-soldiers breaking into Taiwanese residents' homes to molest and insult women have also occurred more than once in Taipei.
    The Taiwan authorities, seeing the 9.5 million Chinese people of Taiwan being subjected to the oppression and humiliation of foreign races, if someone were to ask: "Please look at the world today, whose world is it?" I wonder what they would think? As for the Taiwanese people, who have a patriotic tradition, they will never willingly be slaves of the U.S. imperialists, and their hatred for the U.S. aggressor troops, who are committing all kinds of evil and trampling on our territory in Taiwan, is growing deeper and deeper. On May 24 last year, the Taiwanese people held a patriotic anti-American demonstration, burning down the U.S. "Embassy" and the U.S. Information Service in Taipei City, and surrounding the U.S. military headquarters stationed in Taiwan and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, which was an act of resistance by the Taiwanese people who could no longer tolerate it.
    In the more than a year since the anti-American demonstration in May last year, the Taiwanese people have had hundreds of sporadic anti-American incidents. One of the larger ones was a strike by more than 1,000 workers at the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation against the U.S. annexation of the company and persecution of workers. Although the U.S. military headquarters stationed in Taiwan stipulated that U.S. military officers and soldiers were not allowed to go out alone in Taiwan to avoid "disappearing" in the sea of hatred that the people have for them, incidents of U.S. aggressor personnel being beaten up and simply dealt with by the brave Taiwanese people continue to occur in various parts of Taiwan. In recent times, the barbed wire of many U.S. military restricted areas in Taiwan has often been found with signs posted by Taiwanese patriots saying "This is Chinese territory." Slogans such as "Yankee Go Home" and "No U.S. Occupation of Taiwan" are often found on telephone poles and walls in various cities and villages in Taiwan. Indeed, the Taiwanese people know exactly how to deal with snakes from the United States. Taiwanese newspapers also say that Taiwan is now "a powder keg," with "the danger of igniting at any time."

    他们这一簇毒蛇
    王兴
    最近两个月来，美帝国主义调派到台湾和台湾海峡地区的海、空军和地面部队急剧增加。诸如海军陆战队、“奈克—赫尔克里士式”地对空导弹部队、驾驶各种类型飞机的空军部队和一些步兵和宪兵队伍等，纷纷从美国本土和夏威夷、菲律宾、日本、冲绳等地的美军基地抽调到台湾。在台湾海峡地区和附近担当武装侵略台湾和对我国大陆进行军事威胁任务的美国第七舰队的实力也增加了，共有包括六艘航空母舰在内的一百四十多艘舰艇，六万多兵员。美国通讯社吹嘘说，美国的这些军事部署，是“美国在远东集中了第二次世界大战以来规模最大的一支以原子武器为核心的军事力量。”
    美国战争疯子大举向台湾增兵，一手造成台湾和台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，不仅严重威胁着世界和平，同时，由于美国侵略军的暴行层出不穷，首先使居住在台湾的九百五十万中国人受到侮辱和祸害。
    在美帝国主义这次向台湾大举增兵以前，本来已经有一万多美军官兵，闹得台湾各个城市和乡村民不安生。最近侵台美军大量涌到，更在台湾闹得昏天黑地，两个月来，台湾无数农民的耕地被美军霸占为军事基地和禁区了；数以万计的城乡居民的房屋被强拆了，他们住的地方被美国侵略军围上了铁丝网，挂着“美军驻地，中国人不得入内”的牌子。一群群流离失所的台湾同胞，被美国侵略者害得拖着饥饿的脚步到处流浪。侮辱妇女、酗酒、抢劫、贩毒、军车肇事，美国侵略军正在台湾无恶不作，欺压和侮辱我国的台湾同胞。侵台美军官兵胡作妄为的程度，从合众国际社的一则消息中也可以看出来。这则消息说，在台湾和澎湖的美军“是没有什么军风纪可言的”。
    一个美国记者在描写侵台美军生活的时候，说是美军在台湾撞到的第一个敌人是毒蛇，美军在台湾开辟新的军事基地的时候发现许许多多的蛇。这则特写新闻在报上刊载后，一家台湾报纸的副刊发表了一篇杂文，隐约地说，毒蛇虽然可恶，但是，台湾老百姓不会被它们吓倒；一有机会，当然懂得怎样把毒蛇打死，不管毒蛇是来自什么地方的。这实在是一篇寓言式的杂文，它表达了广大台湾同胞的心情。确实，台湾同胞都把美国侵略军看作毒蛇，看作野兽。台湾是我国的一个美丽的宝岛，并不是毒蛇野兽能够长久盘踞的。如果他们不早日滚回他们应该去的地方；那么，到了应该动手的时候，这些平素害人不浅的凶残的家伙一定会被绞死和打死。
    美国侵略军在台湾的暴行是罄竹难书的。尤其是这两个月来，在高雄、基隆和澎湖马公港这些美国第七舰队舰艇经常停泊和美国水手经常登岸的港口市镇，在台湾中部苗栗县美国建筑空军基地的公馆乡，在台湾南部屏东县枋寮、春日、北旗尾、南势湖等美国海军陆战队进行演习活动的地区，在台北附近美国建筑“奈克—赫尔克里士式”地对空导弹基地的地区，以及散处台湾各地的美国空军基地，都是美军云集，使台湾人民遭受了很大的祸害。
    在高雄市，有一个名叫牟司礼的美国兵把台湾妇女谢秀琴拉上吉普车强加污辱，然后把她从飞奔着的车上摔出来，使谢秀琴的手腕和腰骨都折断了，头部也跌破，鲜血淋漓，昏迷过去。在台南，青年妇女沈女芳被美国兵用暴力强奸。在基隆市，中学女生梁丽芬被美国兵侮辱时极力反抗，几个美国兵竟把她推到海里淹死。驻扎在台湾南部的约四千名美国海军陆战队，更像一群疯狗一样在各处乱窜。目前，台湾南部的人民正在跟美国海军陆战队日日夜夜进行零星的反抗斗争。
    在台湾的政治、经济中心所在地台北市，美国侵略军一样横行霸道。一个美国兵放火烧了台北市的一家爆竹店。美军司令部竟说这是“开玩笑性质”而不加过问。在台北市圆山忠烈路美军六三俱乐部、中山北路三段美军军官俱乐部和罗斯福路四段美军十三航空队俱乐部附近，在圆山大饭店附近，凡是美军众多的地方，台北市民都看作鬼域一般，妇女们白天联群结队才敢经过，以提防受到美国兽兵的侮辱。
    在台湾，凡是美军驻区附近的居民，都宁可闭门家中坐而不敢轻易外出，这已经成为习惯。尤其是妇女，黄昏后非不得已都不出家门，否则碰到美国兵，尤其是喝酒以后的美国兵，便会受到侮辱。每逢美军发薪饷的几天，居民们更极力减少外出。但是，尽管闭门家里坐，台湾同胞仍然常常受到美军的欺负和骚扰。他们的窗户不时被美军用酒瓶掷破，满街是美军车辆的喇叭声，美军的口哨声和狂啸胡喊声。美国兽兵闯进台湾居民家中调戏侮辱妇女的事件，在台北也不止一次地发生过。
    台湾当局眼看台湾的九百五十万中国人备受异族的欺压和凌辱，如果有人问到：“请看今日之域中，竟是谁家之天下？”不知能作何感想？至于富有爱国主义传统的台湾人民是绝不甘心做美帝国主义者的奴隶，他们对于正在台湾无恶不作践踏我国领土的美国侵略军深仇越来越深。去年5月24日台湾人民举行了爱国反美大示威，在台北市烧毁了美国驻台湾“大使馆”和美国新闻处，包围了侵台美军司令部和美国军事援助顾问团，就是台湾人民忍无可忍的一次反抗。
    自从去年5月间发生反美大示威以来的一年多期间，台湾人民又有过好几百次零星的反美事件。其中规模较大的一次是台湾造船公司一千多工人反对美国吞并这家公司和迫害工人，举行了罢工。尽管侵台美军司令部规定美军官兵在台湾不准单独外出，以免在充满了人民对他们的仇恨的海洋中“下落不明”。可是，美国侵略军人员被勇敢的台湾人民痛打一顿和干脆加以收拾的事件，在台湾各地仍然陆续发生。最近时期以来，台湾许多美军禁区的铁丝网上，常常发现台湾的爱国者挂上“这是中国领土”的牌子。在台湾各个城市和乡村的电线杆子上和墙壁上，更常常发现“美国鬼子滚出去”、“不准美国霸占台湾”等标语。确实，台湾人民完全知道应该怎样对付来自美国的毒蛇的。台湾报纸也说，现在台湾“民心如火”，随时都有“燃烧起来的危险”。
