    Must Work on Two Fronts Simultaneously

    October is a crucial juncture, both for the iron and steel front and for the autumn harvest and planting. The task of advancing on both fronts simultaneously and achieving decisive victories in both this month is naturally very arduous. Since this is the case, we must work on two fronts simultaneously, grasping iron and steel production with one hand and agriculture with the other. Only in this way can we achieve a double leap forward in both steel and agriculture.

    The experience of Chuxiong County in Yunnan Province shows that it is entirely possible to achieve this. It is unacceptable to focus on one and neglect the other. Some people complain that "there are too many tasks and labor is strained," and therefore advocate that "steel production should be stopped for the time being." Others believe that since steel production cannot be relaxed, it is permissible to be a little careless about the autumn harvest. Both of these ideas are wrong. Our current task is to launch a struggle on both fronts and correct these two kinds of ideas and practices.

    What should we do? Chuxiong has a good method: mobilizing everyone to engage in a great debate, handing over the difficulties to the masses to solve. As a result, the "labor shortage theory" was refuted, a large number of laborers were identified, and a double leap forward situation in steelmaking and autumn harvesting and planting emerged. Like the example of Chuxiong, there are such examples all over the country. It is recommended that all localities seize these types of examples and vigorously promote them.

    必须两面开弓
    10月是一个紧要关头，既是钢铁战线的紧要关头，又是秋收秋种的紧要关头。两条战线要在这个月齐头并进，同时取得决定性胜利，任务自然非常艰巨。既然如此，我们就非两面开弓不可，就非一手抓钢铁，一手抓农业不可。只有这样，才能做到钢铁农业双跃进。
    云南楚雄县的经验说明完全有可能做到这一步。抓一头，丢一头是不行的。有的人埋怨“任务太多了劳力紧张”，因此主张眼前要让“钢铁下马”，有的人认为既然钢铁放松不得，就主张容许秋收马虎一点。这两种想法都不对。我们当前的任务就是要展开两条战线的斗争，纠正这两种想法和作法。
    怎么办？楚雄有好办法，发动大家大辩论，把困难交给群众去解决，结果驳倒了“劳力紧张论”，辩出了大批劳动力，出现了炼钢炼铁和秋收秋种双跃进的局面。像楚雄的榜样，全国各地到处都有，建议各地抓住这类榜样，大力加以推广。
