Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th. The full text of General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, farewell speech before boarding the train at Pyongyang Station today is as follows: Respected Premier Kim Il-sung, dear elders, brothers and sisters of Pyongyang:

    The last train of the Chinese People's Volunteers' complete withdrawal from Korea is about to depart. With infinite reluctance, we bid farewell to the respected Premier! Farewell to the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government! Farewell to our close comrades-in-arms, the People's Army! Farewell to the people from all walks of life in Pyongyang! Farewell to the heroic Korean people!

    We have fought and lived together with the heroic Korean people on the beautiful land of Korea for a full eight years. At this moment of parting, words cannot express our feelings. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, I once again extend the most sincere respect and deepest gratitude to the fraternal Korean people, thanking them for their support and meticulous care over the past eight years; thank you for the high honor and such warm farewell you have given us!

    In these eight years of joint struggle, the fraternal friendship between our two peoples has been greatly consolidated and developed. This great unity and lofty friendship, built on the foundation of internationalism, has always been a reliable guarantee for us to defend peace and achieve victory in socialist construction. Every one of our commanders and fighters will cherish this unity and friendship as we cherish our own eyes. Although we have left Korea, our hearts will always be with you.

    Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. With our actions, we have powerfully demonstrated to the world the sincere desire of the Chinese and Korean peoples to safeguard peace and promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The United States military must withdraw from southern Korea. If it continues to occupy southern Korea and artificially create a division between North and South Korea, it will only be more strongly condemned by the people of the world and become more isolated. We believe that the Korean people's will to unify their motherland is unstoppable by any force. The beautiful three thousand ri of Korea will surely be unified. The future victory will surely belong to you!

    Goodbye!
    Elders, brothers and sisters of Pyongyang!
    Long live the heroic Korean people!
    Long live the unbreakable China-Korea friendship cemented in blood!
    Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    向英雄的朝鲜人民告别
    杨勇上将在平壤车站上的告别词
    新华社平壤25日电　中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将今天在平壤车站上登车前的告别词，全文如下：敬爱的金日成首相同志亲爱的平壤市父老兄弟姊妹们：
    中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜的最后一列车就要启程了。我们怀着无限留恋的心情，向敬爱的首相告别！向朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府领导同志告别！向亲密的战友人民军告别！向平壤市各界人民告别！向英雄的朝鲜人民告别！
    我们在朝鲜美丽的国土上，同英雄的朝鲜人民一起战斗，一起生活了整整八年，在这分别的时刻，千言万语也难以表达我们此刻的心情。我代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵，再一次向兄弟般的朝鲜人民，致以最崇高的敬意和最深切的感谢，感谢朝鲜人民八年来对我们的支援和无微不至的关怀；感谢朝鲜人民给予我们的崇高荣誉和如此热情的欢送！
    在这八年共同斗争的时间里，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊大大巩固和发展了。这种建立在国际主义基础上的伟大团结与崇高的友谊，始终是我们保卫和平和获得社会主义建设胜利的可靠保证。我们每个指战员，都将如同爱护自己的眼睛一样，珍视这种团结与友谊。我们虽然离开了朝鲜，但我们的心永远同你们在一起。
    现在，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜了。我们用行动向全世界有力地说明了中朝两国人民对于维护和平、促使朝鲜问题和平解决的真诚愿望。美国军队必须从朝鲜南部撤出去。如果它继续霸占朝鲜南部，人为地制造南北朝鲜的分裂，那就只会使它受到全世界人民更加强烈的谴责而更加陷于孤立。我们相信，朝鲜人民统一自己祖国的意志，是任何力量也不能阻挡的。朝鲜三千里锦绣山河，是一定会得到统一的。未来的胜利一定是属于你们的！
    再见吧！
    平壤市父老兄弟姊妹们！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    以鲜血凝成的牢不可破的中朝友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！
