Commemorating the Japanese Painter Ogata Kōrin
Ye Qianyu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association

Ogata Kōrin is one of the world cultural figures we commemorate this year. He was an outstanding painter of modern Japan, born in 1658 AD, and this year marks the 300th anniversary of his birth.

He lived during the Genroku period of the Edo era in Japan. At this time, the economy and culture of the ruling feudal class had begun to decline, replaced by the culture of the emerging urban commercial and industrial bourgeoisie. The painter Ogata Kōrin, along with the poet Matsuo Bashō, the novelist Ihara Saikaku, and the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon, were brilliant representatives of this period of bourgeois culture.

Ogata Kōrin possessed diverse artistic talents, excelling not only in painting but also in decorative design for ceramics, lacquerware, and dyeing and weaving. His works reflected the thoughts, hobbies, and demands of the emerging bourgeois class and possessed a distinct Japanese national style. His painting style formed the "Kōrin School," which greatly influenced later generations, and even today, Japanese painting art retains the spirit of Kōrin.

Ogata Kōrin was born in Kyoto to a wealthy merchant family dealing in dyeing and weaving. His father, Soken, was skilled in calligraphy and painting, and Soken's uncle was the famous painter Hon'ami Kōetsu. Growing up in this environment, Kōrin was influenced by his father Soken from an early age and came into contact with many artists, nurturing his artistic talents. He initially studied painting with his father Soken and Yamamoto Soken of the "Kano School," but later he discovered the painting styles of Hon'ami Kōetsu and Tawaraya Sōtatsu. In particular, Sōtatsu's artistic ideas, which represented the bourgeois class, greatly inspired him. Therefore, Kōrin's painting subsequently aimed to revive the painting styles of Kōetsu and Sōtatsu. At that time, the "Kano School" and "Tosa School" art, representing the feudal ruling class, had become increasingly decadent. Sōtatsu was the first to reveal the spirit of the bourgeois class in painting, and it was only natural that Kōrin, with his free-thinking ideas, accepted Sōtatsu's painting tradition.

However, Kōrin was not satisfied with the artistic achievements of Kōetsu and Sōtatsu. He brilliantly developed this school of painting, creating his own style that was rich, bright, and full of decorative interest, shining brilliantly in the art world at the time. After the age of forty-three, he became a "Hokkyō" (a kind of rank given to artists and monks at the time), so the inscription on his paintings included "Hokkyō Kōrin." His creative peak was around the time after he obtained the "Hokkyō" title, and many of his important works were created during this period. It was also during this period that his personal painting style was established.

When Kōrin's painting talent was developing, his family's dyeing and weaving business declared bankruptcy. Soon after, Kōrin left Kyoto and moved to Edo (present-day Tokyo), relying on selling paintings and receiving assistance from others to make a living. His life was hard, his health deteriorated, and he later returned to Kyoto. On June 2, 1716, he passed away at the age of fifty-eight.

Kōrin left behind many works, including painted ceramics and *makie* (lacquer art), in addition to paintings. Painting was the main body of his work, including sketchbooks, small pieces, fan paintings, hanging scrolls, and folding screens. The sketchbooks were drafts he drew for research and creation. These drafts were mostly drawn very meticulously, such as the sketchbooks of "Peacock" and "Duck," which not only had precise depictions of the whole but also detailed descriptions of local details and various movements. It is said that he planted flowers and trees of the four seasons and raised birds, beasts, insects, and fish in his villa in Kurama, Kyoto, constantly observing and sketching in depth, never tiring. From this, we can see Kōrin's profound observation of the natural world. The fan paintings he painted, although small pieces, were also very carefully done, breaking the traditional forms, giving full play to his unique design, and showing his extraordinary compositional talent. Hanging scrolls such as "Ise Monogatari" and "Tale of Genji" were taken from classical literature, and there were also "Daoist and Buddhist Figure Paintings," "Azalea Paintings," "Vimalakirti Image," and "Portrait of Nakamura Kuranosuke," etc. Among them, "Portrait of Nakamura Kuranosuke" is the only one of Kōrin's works with a recorded date (1704). These works include figures, landscapes, and flowers and birds, and the styles are different, but the large-scale folding screens best display Kōrin's artistic characteristics. Kōrin's artistic talent was most fully expressed on the folding screen.

Kōrin's main folding screen works include "Red and White Plum Blossoms," "Irises," "Umbrella Pine and Maple," "Peacocks," "Waves," "Yatsuhashi," "Hollyhocks," "Jiang Taigong," and "Thirty-Six Immortal Poets," etc. These folding screens are mostly painted in heavy tones on a gold background, with strong and dazzling color effects. The decorative beauty is brought to the fullest in composition and color, which is precisely the special strength of Kōrin's art.

"Irises" originally evolved from "Yatsuhashi"; "Yatsuhashi" originally evolved from "Ise Monogatari." Kōrin first created "Yatsuhashi," omitting the figures, and later even the bridge was omitted, becoming "Irises." This folding screen is full of bright and lively feelings. He used bright ultramarine and malachite green to paint the flowers and leaves on the gold background. Although the painting is simple, the layers of the flowers and leaves are distinct, the postures are varied, the composition is rich in changes, and the realistic style and the decorative style are cleverly unified. The composition of "Red and White Plum Blossoms" is very bold. In the middle of the golden screen, a winding stream is painted. The stream and the revolving water waves are treated with unique design. The water patterns he created were called "Kōrin Waves" by later generations. On both sides of the river, one red and one white plum blossom tree are painted. The tree body cleverly uses the painting method of splashing ink and adding color, which echoes the rhythm of the water waves, making the entire picture rich and lively. "Thirty-Six Immortal Poets" is a figure painting screen. Kōrin used a humorous brushstroke to paint the images of thirty-six ancient Japanese poets, which is very intriguing. From the perspective of expressing the character characteristics of the characters, he is clearly a step further than Sōtatsu. Other works will not be listed here.

From a general point of view, Kōrin's interest and expertise are obviously in depicting the flowers, plants, and trees of the natural world. With the sensitivity of an artist, he comprehends the beauty of the shape and color inherent in the plants and trees themselves and turns them into designs, reflecting the realistic spirit of the bourgeois class at that time and opening up a new realm in painting. The progressive significance and value of Kōrin's art lie precisely here.

Kōrin's paintings and crafts designs enjoy a great reputation among the Japanese people. His artistic career is immortal. It not only directly influenced Japanese national painting but also enriched the world's cultural and artistic treasure house. The World Peace Council listed him as one of the world's cultural celebrities to commemorate him on the 300th anniversary of his birth, which is very meaningful.

There is a long historical tradition of cultural and artistic exchanges between China and Japan. It can be seen from Kōrin's works that many of them are taken from China, such as "Li Bai Watching the Waterfall," "Vimalakirti," "Hanshan and Shide," and so on. Therefore, we feel very cordial and happy to commemorate him here today and hold an exhibition of his works. We wish the exhibition a success and firmly believe that through this meaningful commemorative activity, the friendship between Chinese and Japanese artists and the broad masses of the people will be further developed and consolidated.

    纪念日本画家尾形光琳
    中国美术家协会副主席　叶浅予
    尾形光琳是今年我们所纪念的世界文化名人之一，他是近代日本的一位杰出的画家，生于公元1658年，今年是他诞生三百周年纪念。
    他生活的年代，正当日本江户元禄时期。这时居于统治地位的封建阶级的经济文化已开始衰退，代之而起的是反映新兴城市工商业发展的市民阶级文化。画家尾形光琳和诗人松尾巴蕉、小说家井原西鹤、剧作家近松门左卫门等，正是这一时期的市民文化的光辉的代表人物。
    尾形光琳具有多方面的艺术才能，不但精于绘画，并擅长陶器、漆器、染织的装饰设计。他的作品反映了新兴的市民阶级的思想、爱好和要求，并且具有鲜明的日本民族的风格；他的画风形成了“光琳画派”，对后世影响很大，至今日本的绘画艺术，还保留着光琳的精神。
    尾形光琳生于京都一个染织业大商人的家庭。他的父亲宗谦擅长书画，宗谦的舅父就是有名的画家本阿弥光悦。光琳生长在这个环境里，自幼就受到父亲宗谦的熏陶，并接触了许多美术家，培育了他的艺术才能。他最初从父亲宗谦和“狩野派”的画家山本素轩学画，但后来他发现了本阿弥光悦和俵屋宗达的画风，特别是代表市民阶级的宗达的艺术思想给了他很大启发，所以此后光琳的绘画便以复兴光悦、宗达的画风为目标。当时代表封建统治阶级的“狩野派”“土佐派”艺术已日趋衰颓，宗达第一个在绘画中揭示了市民阶级的精神，具有自由思想的光琳接受宗达的绘画传统，正是十分自然的事。
    但是光琳并不满足于光悦、宗达的艺术成就，他天才地发展了这一画派，创造出丰妍明朗、富有装饰情趣的自己的风格；在当时画坛上放出了异彩。四十三岁以后，他当了“法桥”（这是当时艺术家和僧侣的一种升阶），所以画款中出现了“法桥光琳”。他的创作旺盛期大约在获得“法桥”以后，他的许多重要作品都创作在这个时期，他的个人绘画风格的确立也在这个时期。
    当光琳的绘画才能正在发展时候，他的祖传的染织业宣告了破产。不久光琳离开京都移住江户（现在的东京），依靠卖画度日和接受别人的接济，生活清苦，身体衰弱，后回京都，1716年6月2日，他与世长辞了，享年五十八岁。
    光琳遗留的作品很多，除绘画以外，还有陶器画、莳绘（漆工艺）等，绘画是他作品的主体。绘画中又包括写生帖、小品、团扇画、挂屏、画屏等。写生帖是他为研究和创作所画的画稿，这些画稿大都画得很精细，如“孔雀”和“鸭”的写生帖，不但有整体的精确描绘，并有局部细节和各种动态的描写。据说他在京都鞍马的别墅，曾栽植四时花木，豢养鸟兽虫鱼，经常深入观察和写生，不知倦怠。从这里可以看出光琳对于自然界的精深观察。他所绘制的扇画虽是小品，但也是十分经心，打破了历来的形式，发挥独特的意匠，表现出他非凡的构图天才。挂屏中如“伊势物语”、“紫式部图”皆取材于古典文学，又有“道释人物图”、“踯躅图”、“维摩像”、“中村内藏助像”等等，其中“中村内藏助像”是光琳作品中唯一记有年代（1704年）的。这些作品有人物、山水、花鸟，而且风格不一，但最足以显示光琳艺术特色的还是大幅画屏。光琳的艺术天才在画屏上得到了最充分的发挥。
    光琳主要的画屏作品有“红白梅图”、“燕子花图”、“槙枫图”、“孔雀图、”“波浪图”、“八桥图”、“立葵图”、“太公望图”和“三十六歌仙图”等等。这些画屏大都是以浓重的色调画于金色地上的，色彩效果强烈，灿烂夺目。构图和色彩上把装饰的美发挥得淋漓尽致；这正是光琳艺术的特长。
    “燕子花图”原是从“八桥图”演化而来的；“八桥图”原从“伊势物语图”演化而来。光琳先创作“八桥图”，省去了人物，后来连桥也省去了，成为“燕子花图”。这件画屏充满了明朗活泼的情调；他在金色的底子上用鲜明的群青和石绿来画花叶，画的虽然简单，但花叶层次分明，姿态多样，构图富有变化，巧妙地把写实风格和装饰风格统一了起来。“红白梅图”的构图非常大胆，在金色的画屏中间，画出了一道弯曲的溪流，溪身和回旋的水波都是经过独特的意匠处理的。他所创作的这种水纹，被后人称为“光琳波”。河的两侧画红、白梅花各一树，树身巧妙地运用了泼墨加彩的画法，和水波的韵律化相映成趣。使整个画面具有富丽而生动的韵致。“三十六歌仙图”是一件人物画屏，光琳用一种富于幽默的笔调，画出了日本古代三十六位诗人的形象，非常耐人寻味，从表现人物的性格特征来看，他比宗达显然又进了一步。其他作品就不多列举了。
    从总的方面看来，光琳的兴趣和专长显然还是在描绘自然界的花草树木方面，他以艺术家的敏感领悟草木本身所具有的形和色的美，而加以意匠化，反映了当时市民阶级的现实精神，开辟了绘画中的新境界。光琳艺术的进步意义和价值也正在这里。
    光琳的绘画和工艺设计在日本人民中间享有很大声誉。他的艺术事业是不朽的，它不但直接影响日本民族绘画，也丰富了世界文化艺术宝库。世界和平理事会在他诞生三百周年纪念时，把他列为世界文化名人之一来纪念他，是很有意义的。
    中、日两国文化艺术的交流有悠久的历史传统，从光琳作品中也可以看出有许多是取材于中国的，如“李白观瀑图”、“维摩居士像”、“寒山拾得图”等等。所以今天我们在这里纪念他，并举行他的作品展览，感到十分亲切和愉快。我们预祝展览会成功，并深信通过这个有意义的纪念活动，能使中、日两国艺术家和广大人民的友谊得到更进一步的发展和巩固。（附图片）
