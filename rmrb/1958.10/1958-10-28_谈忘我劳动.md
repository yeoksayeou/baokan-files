People returning from the countryside all say: everywhere you see people who disregard remuneration, don't pay attention to time, and labor selflessly. To produce more steel, they have no water to drink, they gnaw on dry rations, and dig ore in the mountains; to produce more grain, they eat in the fields, live in the fields, and labor hard in deep plowing the land. Their selfless labor is not to acquire ordinary labor results, but to create astonishing miracles.

All miracles can only be created by those who labor selflessly. A few farmers can create a miracle of more than 7,300 catties of wheat per mu, but a few agronomists cannot do such an amazing thing. Why? There are many reasons. But the most fundamental one is: one is able to labor selflessly, and the other is unable to labor selflessly. Selfless labor is not something that anyone can do; only those who have established communist ideology will have a communist labor attitude. For example, a farmer who creates a miracle only has one thought when creating a miracle: to realize his ideals. Zhang Guangyi from Henan is such a typical figure. To reform tools, he sacrificed all personal interests, and even when his wife threatened him with divorce, he did not give up his ideals. Some agronomists may not be like this when carrying out inventions. They often consider some personal issues, such as: Can this invention be successful? If it is not successful, will it affect their acquired reputation? Because of these individualistic thoughts, it is impossible to create miracles. Those miracles in scientific research, industrial and agricultural production can only be created by "ordinary" young teachers, students, and workers.

In fact, selfless labor has long been a characteristic of our society, or the "constitution" of this society. Everyone knows that whether it is socialism or communism, there is a principle: "From each according to his ability." What is "from each according to his ability"? It is selfless labor, it is complete selflessness, labor for the public good, it is exerting as much strength as one has, and doing as much as needs to be done. This can of course only be done in a socialist society where the working people are masters and work for themselves; it cannot be done in a capitalist society where people exploit people. In the wage labor of capitalist society, doing more work means being exploited for more blood and sweat by landlords and capitalists, so work is not a joy of life, but "suffering."

Is "from each according to his ability" and "selfless labor" intense or not? Of course it is intense. This kind of rhythmic intensity, this intensity for the realization of great ideals, is a great thing, which can accelerate socialist construction and prepare for a gradual transition to communism. Among the conditions for transitioning to communism are: extremely abundant products and a universal increase in people's communist ideological awareness, and the universal establishment of communist morality. "From each according to his ability" and "selfless labor" are precisely one of the basic methods for realizing these conditions.

Not "from each according to his ability," not "selfless labor," of course is not intense, for example, the monks in the temple are not intense, the so-called "being a monk for a day and striking the bell for a day." All day long, they recite "Namo Amitabha" slowly or strike the bell one by one. Those who are unwilling to be intense are not exactly the same as monks. Everyone is enthusiastically laboring selflessly and creating miracles, but he is "striking the bell" one by one. The result, of course, is: "Seven days in the mountains, thousands of years in the world," being thrown far, far away by the times. At that time, it will be too late to regret!

    谈忘我劳动
    梅耳
    从农村回来的人都说：在那里到处可以见到不计报酬、不讲时间、忘我劳动的人。为了多出钢铁，他们没有水喝，啃着干粮，在矿山上挖着矿石；为了多产粮食，他们吃在田间、住在田间，辛辛苦苦在深翻土地。他们这样地忘我劳动，并不是要求获得一般的劳动果实，而是要求创造惊人的奇迹。
    一切奇迹，只有忘我劳动的人创造得出来。几个农民可以创造麦子亩产七千三百多斤的奇迹，但是几个农业学家就不可能做得出这样惊人的事情。为什么？原因很多。但是其中最根本的一个原因是：一个是能够忘我劳动，一个是不能够忘我劳动。忘我劳动，不是任何一个人都可以做得到的，只有树立了共产主义思想的人，才会有共产主义的劳动态度。例如一个创造奇迹的农民，在创造奇迹的时候，就只能有一个思想：为了实现自己的理想。河南有个张广义就是这样的典型人物。为了改革工具，他牺牲了一切个人利益，甚至他妻子用离婚来威胁他的时候，他也没有放弃自己的理想。有些农业学家在进行发明创造的时候，就不可能是这样了。他们往往会考虑一些个人的问题，例如：这个发明创造能不能成功？不成功会不会影响自己已获得的声誉？……正因为有这些个人主义思想，就不可能创造出奇迹来。那些科学研究、工农业生产上的奇迹，就只能让“平凡”的青年师生、工人去创造。
    其实，忘我劳动，早就是我们这个社会的特点，或者是这个社会的
  “宪法”。谁都知道，不论社会主义和共产主义，都有这么一个原则：“各尽所能”。什么叫“各尽所能”，就是忘我劳动，就是大公无私，舍己为公的劳动，就是有多大力量就使多大力量，需要做多少事情就做多少事情。这当然只能在劳动人民当了主人，为自己劳动的社会主义社会中才能办到，在人剥削人的资本主义社会中是办不到的。资本主义社会的雇佣劳动，多干活就是被地主、资本家榨取更多的血汗，所以干活不是生活的乐事，而是“受苦”。
    “各尽所能”“忘我劳动”，紧张不紧张呢？当然紧张。这种有节奏的紧张、为了实现伟大理想的紧张是大好事，能够加速社会主义建设并准备逐步过渡到共产主义去。过渡到共产主义去的条件中有：产品极大地丰富和人们共产主义思想觉悟普遍提高、共产主义道德品质普遍树立。“各尽所能”“忘我劳动”，正是实现这些条件的基本办法之一。
    不“各尽所能”，不“忘我劳动”，当然不紧张，比如寺院里的和尚就是不紧张的，所谓“做一天和尚撞一天钟”，他们一天到晚，不紧不慢地念“南无阿弥陀佛”或者一下一下地撞钟。不愿紧张的人，还不是同和尚一模一样。大家都在轰轰烈烈地忘我劳动，创造奇迹，而他却在一下一下“撞钟”，其结果，当然是：“山中方七日，世上已千年”，被时代扔得远远的远远的。那时，真是悔之晚矣！
