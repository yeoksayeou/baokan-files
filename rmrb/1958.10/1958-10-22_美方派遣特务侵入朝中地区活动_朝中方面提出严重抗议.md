Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: At today's meeting of the Secretaries of the Military Armistice Commission, the Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side lodged a serious protest against the U.S. side's recent violation of the armistice agreement by dispatching special agents to invade the Korean-Chinese side area, and strongly demanded that the U.S. side immediately stop such behavior.

At the meeting, the Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side, based on the physical and testimonial evidence verified by the 5th Joint Observation Team during its on-site investigation, pointed out that the U.S. special agent, Lu Changzhi, was originally a student in Wonsan. In December 1950, he was abducted by the U.S. military to South Korea and became a displaced civilian. Later, he was forced to undergo special agent training by the U.S. military. On October 10th of this year, under the cover of U.S. armed personnel, he landed in the demilitarized zone near Goseong, in the Korean-Chinese side area, by rubber boat, attempting to carry out hostile activities such as spying on military intelligence, and was immediately arrested by the Korean-Chinese side's civil police.

The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side pointed out that this behavior of the U.S. side completely violates the armistice agreement, and notified the U.S. side that the Korean-Chinese side is prepared to return the rubber boat used by Lu Changzhi and other items he brought with him to the U.S. side, as it has been confirmed that these are all U.S. property.

In order to evade responsibility for violating the armistice agreement, the U.S. Secretary mentioned issues unrelated to this matter in his speech. He dared not look at the American-made rubber boat, camera, pistol, etc., carried by the U.S. special agent Lu Changzhi, which were on display, nor did he dare to accept these items.

The Secretary of the Korean-Chinese side exposed and rebuked the U.S. side's shameless attitude, and pointed out that if the U.S. side disregards the protests and warnings of the Korean-Chinese side and continues to engage in hostile activities against the Korean-Chinese side, the U.S. side will bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    美方派遣特务侵入朝中地区活动
    朝中方面提出严重抗议
    新华社平壤20日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：在今天举行的军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，朝中方面秘书长对美方最近又违反停战协定派遣特务侵入朝中方面地区的行为提出严重抗议，并且强硬要求美方立即停止这类行为。
    朝中方面秘书长在会上根据第五联合观察小组进行现场调查时查明的人证物证指出，美方特务吕昌植原来是元山市的学生，在1950年12月被美军劫往南朝鲜成为失所平民，后来又被强迫受美军的特务训练。今年10月10日，他在美方武装人员掩护下，乘橡皮船在高城附近非军事区朝中方面地区登陆，企图进行刺探军事情报等敌对行为，当场即被朝中方面民政警察逮捕。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方这种行为完全违反停战协定，并且通知美方，朝中方面准备把吕昌植所乘用的橡皮船和带来的其它物品交还给美方，因为已经证实这都是美方的东西。
    美方秘书长为了逃避违反停战协定的责任，在发言中扯到同这个问题毫不相干的问题上去。他不敢看陈列出来的美方特务吕昌植所携带的美造橡皮船、照像机、手枪等，也不敢接受这些东西。
    朝中方面秘书长揭露和斥责了美方的这种无耻态度，并且指出，如果美方不愿朝中方面的抗议和警告，继续向朝中方面进行敌对行为的话，由此引起的一切后果将由美方负完全责任。
