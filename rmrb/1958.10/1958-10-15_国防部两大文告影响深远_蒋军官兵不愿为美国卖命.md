Xinhua News Agency, 14th - The "Letter to Taiwan Compatriots" and the order to continue the ceasefire on the bombardment of Jinmen for two weeks, issued successively by Minister Peng Dehuai of our Ministry of National Defense, have already had a profound impact on the Chiang Kai-shek army in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu.

According to various sources, the Chiang army on Jinmen Island was extremely nervous before the Ministry of National Defense issued the order to continue the ceasefire at midnight on October 12. The whole island was dark, and Chiang's soldiers and officers hid in tunnels and bunkers. However, the whole night was quiet with no artillery fire. On the 13th, the news that the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front continued to suspend shelling spread quickly, and Chiang's soldiers and officers breathed a sigh of relief. Many Chiang soldiers and officers discussed in secret, "Chinese people are still Chinese people. If the Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu issues are resolved peacefully, none of us will die, and everyone can go home."

Missing home, being tired of war, and longing for a peaceful life has become a fairly common sentiment in Chiang Kai-shek's army. Recently, when Chiang's troops in Taiwan were being transferred, Chiang's officers, soldiers, and their families were very worried about being transferred to Jinmen, Mazu, and other places. The families of Chiang's soldiers and officers often went to various train stations in Taiwan to see them off. However, Chiang's headquarters stipulated that they were not allowed to meet. The train stations were filled with crying, which was very tragic. Many Chiang soldiers who were originally from Taiwan took sleeping pills at night in Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, so they could fall asleep earlier and avoid missing home. Chiang's soldiers whose homes were on the mainland were even more universally homesick. One Chiang soldier, who wanted to return to the mainland but still had concerns, wrote on a small piece of paper: "Missing my hometown, thinking of my family, never ceasing; wanting to return home, but the rumors are inconsistent, everything makes me, who is abroad, skeptical." Another Chiang middle-ranking officer wrote that he "produced a strong desire to miss his family and relatives that had been suppressed in his heart for a long time."

The vast majority of Chiang's soldiers and officers are dissatisfied with being enslaved by the United States and fighting for the United States in a humiliating situation. Anti-American control sentiment is growing in Chiang's army. One Chiang lieutenant colonel said, "If the civil war stops soon, China can become stronger, and living in Taiwan will not be bullied by foreigners." A folk song is circulating in the Chiang army in Penghu: "The moon is curved and shines on Penghu, being a soldier and risking your life is a miserable life, worrying the parents at home, and making the tall-nosed Americans happy."

### 国防部两大文告影响深远  蒋军官兵不愿为美国卖命

    国防部两大文告影响深远
    蒋军官兵不愿为美国卖命
    新华社14日讯　我国防部彭德怀部长先后发表“告台湾同胞书”和继续停止炮击金门两星期的命令以后，在台、澎、金、马的蒋介石军队中已经引起了深远的影响。
    据各方面消息，金门岛上的蒋军在10月12日午夜我国防部发布继续暂停炮击的命令以前，神经都非常紧张，全岛乌灯黑火，蒋军官兵纷纷藏身在坑道和掩体中。但是，整个晚上静寂无炮声。13日白天，福建前线解放军继续暂停炮击的消息就不胫而走，蒋军官兵们都松了一口气。许多蒋军官兵背地议论说：“中国人总归是中国人。和平解决台澎金马，我们就一个也死不了，大家都能回家。”
    思家厌战，渴望过和平生活，这已经成为蒋介石部队中相当普遍的军心。最近时期以来，当在台湾的蒋军部队调动的时候，蒋军官兵和他们的家属都很耽心被调到金门、马祖等地。蒋军官兵的家属常常到台湾各火车站送行。但蒋军总部规定不准见面。弄得火车站上一片哭啼，非常凄惨。许多原籍台湾的蒋军士兵到了澎湖、金门、马祖，晚上都吃点安眠药，好早点入睡免得想家。家在大陆的蒋军士兵，更是普遍思念家乡。有一个想回大陆但还有顾虑的蒋军士兵在一张小纸头上写道：“思故乡，想骨肉，无时或释；欲返里，奈传说不一，一切的一切使在外的我将信将疑。”另外一个蒋军中级军官写道，他“产生一种久久抑压心中的思家念亲的强烈念头”。
    广大蒋军官兵都不满受美国奴役和替美国打仗的屈辱处境。反美国控制的情绪在蒋军部队中正在增长。有一个蒋军中校说：“内战早日停止，中国就可以更加强大，住在台湾也不受外国人欺负了。”在澎湖蒋军部队中流行着一首歌谣：“月儿弯弯照澎湖，当兵卖命活受苦，急坏了家中爹和娘，乐坏了美国高鼻子。”
