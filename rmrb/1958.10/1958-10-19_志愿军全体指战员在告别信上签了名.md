Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th—General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, signed the Chinese People's Volunteers' farewell letter to the Korean people at 8:40 this morning. By this point, all commanders, fighters, and staff of the Volunteers had signed the letter, which has now been bound into a book. The cover bears the inscription in the handwriting of Peng Dehuai, former commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers: "Farewell Letter from the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean People."

The entire force of commanders, fighters, and staff of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who fought alongside the heroic Korean people to defeat the American aggressors, felt deeply reluctant to part with their comrades-in-arms. Since the initiative to sign the farewell letter to the Korean people was launched in early March this year, a wave of signatures quickly swept across the entire army. From the front lines to the banks of the Yalu River, many companies held solemn signing ceremonies and vowed to forever uphold the profound friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and to support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their country. Some commanders and combatants even carefully arranged their names into patterns such as "Eternal Friendship Between China and Korea," "Long Live Peace," and "Peace Dove" when signing.

    志愿军全体指战员在告别信上签了名
    新华社平壤18日电　中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将等，今天上午八时四十分在中国人民志愿军向朝鲜人民告别信上签了名。至此，志愿军全体指战员和工作人员都在这封信上签了名。现在，这封告别信已经装订成册。部首有志愿军前司令员彭德怀的亲笔题字：“中国人民志愿军向朝鲜人民告别信”。
    同英雄的朝鲜人民一起打败美国侵略者的中国人民志愿军全军指战员和工作人员，在同自己的战友离别的时候，心情依依难舍。今年3月初，自从有人发起在向朝鲜人民告别信上签名的倡议以来，全军迅速形成了签名的高潮。从前沿阵地到鸭绿江畔，不少连队都举行了隆重的签名仪式，并且宣誓永远维护中朝两国人民的深厚友谊和团结，支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争。有些指挥员和战斗员在签名时，还细心地将名字组成“中朝友谊万古常青”、“和平万岁”以及“和平鸽”等图案。
