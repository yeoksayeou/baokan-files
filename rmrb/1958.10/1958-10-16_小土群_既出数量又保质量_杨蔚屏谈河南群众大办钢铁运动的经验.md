Xinhua News Agency, Shangcheng, October 15th: Yang Weiping, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, detailed Henan Province's experience in the mass steel production movement at the National On-the-Spot Conference on Indigenous Steel Smelting in Shangcheng on the 13th. He said that, according to Henan's experience, mass steel production, like the development of agriculture, culture, education, and other socialist construction undertakings, is a pressing demand of the masses and a widespread mass movement; it is also a profound mass communist ideological movement. The result of this movement is a comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction, led by steel.

Yang Weiping first introduced the basic situation of Henan Province and the process of the mass steel production movement. After summarizing the achievements of Henan Province in steel production by implementing the "small indigenous furnace" and the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, he said that, according to the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the situation in Henan Province, we rely mainly on "small indigenous furnaces" to develop steel production, in addition to actively developing modern steel plants. The implementation of this policy encountered several ideological problems and went through considerable debate. One was the blind faith in "large-scale foreign expertise" and the underestimation of "small indigenous furnaces." They believed that relying on "small indigenous furnaces" could not solve the steel needed for industry; they believed that "small indigenous furnaces" were slow, produced little, and wasted effort, and that large-scale operations were more economical. The Provincial Party Committee insisted on the "small indigenous furnace" policy. The Provincial Party Committee believed that large-scale modern production is good, and it would be wrong not to develop it, but Henan Province had no steel foundation, and it would take two years to build a large-scale one. In the current situation, relying solely on large-scale steel enterprises cannot solve the problem of speed. The second thought was a theory of exclusive conditions. They simply emphasized material conditions, seeing things but not people, and reaching out to higher authorities for machines and equipment. We criticized this idea, emphasizing relying on the masses to take the path of self-reliance. The third thought was skepticism because they blindly believed in "large-scale foreign expertise," so they were full of concerns about "small indigenous furnaces," fearing that the normal order would be disrupted, fearing that they were not up to par, and fearing that the quality of the iron would be low and unusable. They stood outside the mass movement, pointing fingers and nitpicking, taking an attitude of disbelief towards the mass steel production. We believe that it is difficult to completely avoid low quality at the beginning of mass steel production, but it is wrong to think that mass steel production cannot improve quality. The quality of steel production develops gradually from low to high; without quantity, there is no quality. When the mass movement is launched, the masses demand both quantity and quality. It should be affirmed that "small indigenous furnaces" can not only solve the quantity problem but also the quality problem. Some counties have now solved the quality problem, so we should firmly believe that the masses can solve the quantity problem and will certainly be able to solve the quality problem. We must encourage the masses to continue to advance on the basis of "small indigenous furnaces." Skeptics also doubted whether industry and agriculture could be carried out simultaneously, but the facts have proved that agriculture is also doing well in places where steel is doing well; agriculture is not doing well in places where steel production is not doing well. If one is concerned that steel production will affect agricultural production and reluctantly tries to grasp steel, both steel and agriculture will inevitably be delayed. These are two different results of being proactive and passive. The fourth thought is the issue of profit and loss. We believe that the lower the cost, the better, of course, but we cannot only calculate the small accounts from steel production. We must calculate the big accounts from various aspects, such as producing more steel to achieve industrialization, agricultural mechanization, defending peace, and gradually transitioning to communism, so as to strengthen our confidence and accelerate the development of the steel industry.

Yang Weiping said that in the mass steel industry, we used the working method of the mass line, carried out great democracy, and deeply mobilized the masses. Whenever a new task is proposed, there are always contradictions between the advanced and the backward among the masses. This requires breaking down and establishing through debate. The content of the debate is: first, why should we develop the steel industry on a large scale? Second, can farmers run steel mills? Third, what methods should be used to run steel mills? Fourth, does running steel mills interfere with agricultural production? We also combined this debate with the opposition to American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan, the defense of world peace, and communist education, combining current interests with long-term interests, and small interests with large interests, and the results were great. Mass steel production has become a household name, and the whole party and the whole people are in high spirits and full of energy. As long as steel is needed, anything is available. Without tools to transport ore, the masses automatically use clothes and bed sheets instead; without wood to make bellows, the masses take out their wardrobes. Therefore, the significance of the great debate on mass steel production is not just the issue of hundreds of thousands of tons of steel, but the issue of communist ideological education, which is truly "refining steel and refining people." Many debates have been carried out in the movements of water conservancy, bearing manufacturing, people's communes, and steel production, and each debate has brought about a surge of communist spirit. Without great debate, the steel industry could never have developed so rapidly. Yang Weiping said that ideological mobilization must be combined with summarizing the local masses' experience to make the mass movement more vigorous. In the mass movement, should we arm the masses with foreign experience or with the local masses' own experience? We believe that foreign experience is very necessary, and we have also held many on-site conferences to exchange experience from various places. However, foreign experience must be combined with the local masses' experience, and the creativity of the local masses must be fully respected. Some areas have been greatly affected by steel production because they have indiscriminately accepted foreign experience and frequently changed furnace types.

In the mass movement, we must also combine ideological mobilization with labor emulation. Henan calls this competition the Red Flag Competition, and red flags are planted everywhere in various regions of the province. Experience has proved that to make the mass movement of mass steel production continue, we must use the advanced examples of the masses to educate the masses and improve the masses, pushing the mass movement from one climax to another.

Yang Weiping then talked about the issue of comprehensively launching satellites, "taking steel as the key link" to organize a comprehensive leap forward. He said that the experience of launching satellites in September proves that there are many benefits and great significance to launching satellites on a large scale, continuously launching satellites, and comprehensively launching satellites. (1) It can boost morale, strive for the upstream, and make steel production leap from the old level to the new level, from low yield to high yield, continuously improving and continuously leaping forward. At the end of August, Lushan launched the first steel satellite. After the Provincial Party Committee grasped this experience, it put forward the slogan of learning from Lushan and catching up with Lushan. By September 15, the daily output of iron had jumped from hundreds of tons in August to more than 18,000 tons. (2) Launching satellites can break superstitions, emancipate the mind, promote the communist spirit of the masses daring to think, daring to speak, daring to despise difficulties, and overcoming difficulties, and can concentrate the wisdom of the masses, with everyone working together for a common goal. (3) Launching satellites can review strength, expose contradictions, and after new imbalances appear, we can grasp the new problems and organize new balances. This has led to a situation in which steel is used as the key link to drive a comprehensive leap forward in other work. (4) Through the large-scale launch of satellites, the Party has initially grasped the laws of organizing the masses in large-scale industrial production movements. (5) The large-scale launch of satellites has a great effect on cadres participating in labor production. Cadres eat, live, and work with the masses, learn technology, and are both commanders and ordinary laborers. (6) The large-scale launch of satellites has promoted communist cooperation between cities and mountainous areas, plains and mountainous areas, the front and the rear, and departments.

Comrade Yang Weiping said that the purpose of launching satellites is to make steel production leap forward again and again, and it must be combined with normal production. It is not for launching satellites for the sake of launching satellites. To achieve continuous satellite launching, we must make full preparations, including ideological preparation, material preparation, and technical preparation.

Yang Weiping also talked about the Party's leadership in the large-scale steel production. He put forward three opinions. First, the first secretary takes the lead, the Party Committee is responsible for the division of labor, and the main leaders go to the front line, so as to achieve a combination of cadres, technicians, and the masses under the leadership of the Party Committee, and to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in all work with steel as the key link. The first secretary grasps agriculture, and agriculture is the focus; grasps industry, and industry is the focus. The division of labor is very important. Without the division of labor, it is very likely that other work will be squeezed out; after the division of labor, the main leaders must personally go into battle. This is a great encouragement to the masses. Second, grasp the combination of labor issues. In the case of tight labor, on the one hand, we must organize professional teams to tap potential, and on the other hand, we must grasp the combination of establishing professional teams and assault forces, so as to achieve both professionalism and flexible deployment. At the same time, we must vigorously carry out technical reforms to reduce labor intensity and improve efficiency. Third, from the perspective of the entire Henan Province, the technical barrier to steel production has not yet been fully broken. According to this situation, the Provincial Party Committee proposed to ensure quantity, improve quality, and comprehensively break through the technical barrier. The Provincial Party Committee proposed to establish 20,000 commander furnaces with a combination of cadres, the masses, and technicians under the leadership of Party committees at all levels to strengthen technical guidance. At the same time, we must also select furnace types that are normally produced, have high yields, and simple equipment as the main furnace types to vigorously promote; in addition to fixed professional teams, we must also form a 100,000-strong steel technology army with party members, league members, technicians and veteran workers as the backbone to lead the entire professional team and march towards technology.

    “小土群”既出数量又保质量
    杨蔚屏谈河南群众大办钢铁运动的经验
    新华社商城15日电　中共河南省委书记杨蔚屏，13日在全国土法炼钢商城现场会议上详细介绍了河南省群众大办钢铁运动的经验。他说，根据河南省的体会，大办钢铁和发展农业、文化教育等社会主义建设事业一样，是群众的迫切要求，是一次广泛的群众运动；也是一个深刻的群众性的共产主义思想运动。这个运动发展的结果，是以钢为纲带动社会主义建设全面大跃进。
    杨蔚屏首先介绍了河南省的基本情况和群众大办钢铁运动的过程。他在概述了河南省在贯彻“小土群”和土洋并举的方针在钢铁生产方面取得的成就以后说，根据党的八大二次会议精神和河南省的情况，我们在发展钢铁生产方面除了积极搞现代化的钢铁厂外，主要的是依靠“小土群”。贯彻执行这个方针曾遇到几种思想问题，也经过很大的争论。一种是迷信“大洋专”，轻视“小土群”。他们认为依靠“小土群”，解决不了工业需要的钢铁；他们认为“小土群”搞的慢，产量少，浪费力量，搞大的才是节约。省委坚持了“小土群”方针。省委认为，大型的现代化生产是好的，不发展是错误的，但是河南省没有钢铁基础，要搞大的得二年搞起来。就目前情况看，单纯依靠大型钢铁企业，解决不了速度问题。第二种思想是唯条件论。他们单纯强调物质条件，见物不见人，伸手向上级要机器要设备。我们批判了这种思想，强调依靠群众走自力更生的道路。第三种思想是怀疑论，因为他们迷信“大洋专”，所以对“小土群”顾虑重重，怕把正常秩序打乱了，怕不正规，怕铁的质量低不能用。他们站在群众运动之外，指手划脚，百般挑剔，对群众大搞钢铁采取了一种不相信的态度。我们认为，群众办钢铁，开始质量低是难以完全避免的，但是如果认为群众办钢铁，不能提高质量则是错误的。钢铁生产的质量是从低到高，逐步发展的；没有数量就没有质量。当群众运动搞起来之后，群众既要求数量也要求质量。应该肯定“小土群”不仅可以解决数量问题，也可以解决质量问题。现在已有些县解决了质量问题，所以我们应该坚信群众能够解决数量问题，也一定能够解决质量问题。要鼓舞群众在“小土群”的基础上不断前进。怀疑派还怀疑工农业是否能够同时并举，但是事实证明，凡是钢铁搞的好的地方，农业也搞的好；钢铁生产搞不好的地方，农业生产也搞的不好。如果顾虑搞钢铁影响农业生产，勉强地去抓钢铁，必然是钢铁、农业两耽误。这是主动和被动的两种结果。第四种思想，是赔钱不赔钱的问题。我们认为，当然成本越低越好，但是，不能光从钢铁生产上来算小账。要从多搞钢铁实现工业化、农业机械化、保卫和平、逐步向共产主义过渡各个方面算大账，才能坚定信心加速钢铁工业的发展。
    杨蔚屏说，在大办钢铁工业中，我们运用了群众路线的工作方法，开展大鸣大放、大辩论，深入发动群众。每当新的任务提出后，在群众中总有先进与落后的矛盾。这就需要通过辩论大破大立。辩论的内容是：一，为什么要大办钢铁工业？二，农民能不能办钢铁？三，用什么办法办钢铁？四，办钢铁误不误农业生产？我们并把这种大辩论和反对美帝国主义侵略我国台湾，保卫世界和平及共产主义前途教育结合起来，把目前利益和长远利益结合起来，小利益和大利益结合起来，结果收获很大。大办钢铁已达到家喻户晓，全党全民意气风发，干劲冲天。只要钢铁需要，要什么就有什么。没有工具运矿石，群众就自动用衣服、被单来代替；没木料做风箱，群众就把自己的衣柜拿出。所以大办钢铁的大辩论，其意义绝不只是几十万吨钢铁的问题，而是共产主义思想教育问题，这真是“炼钢又炼人”。在水利化、轴承化、人民公社化及办钢铁运动中都开展过多次的大辩论，每次辩论都带来了共产主义精神高涨。如果没有大辩论，钢铁工业绝不能这样迅速发展。杨蔚屏说，思想发动要和总结当地群众经验结合起来，才能使群众运动更加蓬勃发展。在群众运动中，是用外来经验来武装群众，还是用本地群众自己的经验来武装群众呢？我们认为，外地经验是非常需要的，我们也召开了许多现场会议交流了各地的经验。但是外地的经验必须和本地群众经验相结合，要十分尊重当地群众的创造。有些地区因为不加选择地接受外地经验，经常改变炉型，因而使钢铁生产受到很大影响。
    在群众运动中，还必须把思想发动和劳动竞赛结合起来。河南把这种竞赛叫做红旗竞赛，在全省各个地区到处插红旗。经验证明，要使大办钢铁的群众运动持续下去，必须用群众的先进榜样，教育群众，提高群众，把群众运动由一个高潮推到另一个高潮。
    杨蔚屏接着谈到了全面放卫星“以钢为纲”组织全面大跃进的问题。他说，9月份放卫星的经验证明，大放卫星，连续放卫星，全面放卫星的好处很多，意义很大。（一）它可以鼓足干劲，力争上游，使钢铁生产由旧的水平跃进到新的水平，由低产变高产，不断提高，不断跃进。8月底，鲁山放出第一颗钢铁卫星后，省委抓住了这个经验，提出学鲁山、赶鲁山的口号，到9月15日，铁的日产量就由8月份的几百吨跃到一万八千多吨。（二）放卫星可以破除迷信，解放思想，发扬群众敢想敢说敢藐视困难，克服困难的共产主义精神，可以集中群众智慧，大家为了一个目标，共同奋斗。（三）放卫星可以检阅力量，暴露矛盾，而在出现了新的不平衡后，就可以抓住新的问题组织新的平衡。这就出现了以钢为纲带动其他工作全面跃进的局面。（四）党通过大放卫星，初步掌握了组织群众大规模地工业生产运动的规律。（五）大放卫星对干部参加劳动生产有很大作用。干部和群众同吃同住同劳动，学会了技术，既是指挥者又是普通劳动者。（六）大放卫星促进了城市和山区、平原和山区、前方和后方，部门和部门之间的共产主义大协作。
    杨蔚屏同志说，放卫星的目的，是为了使钢铁生产跃进再跃进，要和正常生产结合起来。不是为放卫星而放卫星。要作到连续放卫星，必须作好充分的准备，包括思想准备、物资准备、技术准备等。
    杨蔚屏还谈到了在大搞钢铁中党的领导问题。他提出了三点意见。第一，第一书记挂帅，党委分工负责，主要领导人员上前线，做到在党委领导下，干部、技术人员、群众三结合，做到以钢为纲带动全面工作大跃进。第一书记抓农业，农业就是重点；抓工业，工业就是重点。分工很重要，不分工，很可能把其他工作挤掉；分工以后，主要领导人员要亲自上阵。这对群众鼓舞很大。第二，抓劳动力的结合问题。在劳力紧张的情况下，一方面要组织专业队，发挥潜力，另一方面要抓建立专业队伍和突击力量相结合，作到既有专业，又能灵活调配。同时要大力进行技术改革，减轻劳动强度，提高工效。第三，从河南全省看，钢铁生产技术关还没有全面突破。根据这个情况，省委提出保证数量，提高质量，全面突破技术关。省委提出要在各级党委领导下，建立二万个干部、群众、技术人员三结合的指挥炉，以便加强技术指导，同时还要选择生产正常、产量高、设备简单的炉型，作为主力炉型大力推广；除固定专业队外，还要组成以党团员、技术员、老工人为骨干的一支十万人的钢铁技术大军，带动整个专业队，向技术进军。
