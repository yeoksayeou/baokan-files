Ensure Full Stomachs, Good Food, and Savings
Henan Universally Rectifies Public Canteens, Requiring Satisfaction for All

(Our Dispatch) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all localities to earnestly strengthen leadership and ensure the successful operation of public canteens in people's communes.

Henan Province has already established more than 269,000 public canteens, with over 80% of the province's total population, or 98% of the rural population, eating in public canteens. Rural people's communes have universally implemented a grain supply system or food supply system where meals are free. From the very beginning of the people's commune movement, local CCP organizations have paid attention to strengthening leadership in this work. Many local CCP committees have designated a secretary or deputy secretary to specifically lead the rectification and consolidation of public canteens in the people's communes. Geng Qichang, First Secretary of the CCP Xinxiang District Committee, personally led a comprehensive inspection and rectification of public canteens throughout the district. Currently, all canteens in the district have universally established special small stoves to cater to and meet the needs of five types of people: the elderly, the sick, children, pregnant women, and guests. Furthermore, specialized vegetable production teams have been organized, managing small vegetable gardens that can fully meet the needs of the canteens, with an average of nearly two fen of vegetable land per person. Before the rectification in Yuanyang County, 787 canteens in the county were not well managed. After rectification, they were able to cook coarse grains finely, generally avoiding repetition of meals within five or seven days, and improving meals once a week, which was welcomed by the masses. In the "Red Flag Competition" centered on "eating well, eating good, and eating economically," the 80 canteens of the Hecun Township People's Commune in Fangcheng County launched a high tide of learning from, catching up with, and surpassing advanced experiences in running canteens well. After two rounds of evaluation, the backward canteens were basically eliminated.

In order to further consolidate and improve public canteens, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on earnestly running public canteens well, emphasizing: 1. Party committees at all levels must implement the principle of "the secretary taking command" and mobilize the entire party and all the people to run public canteens well. Each level of party committee should have a secretary in charge, and below the county level, a Department of Living Welfare should be established, and above the district committee, an Office of Living Welfare should be established, specifically managing this work. Each food unit should establish a food representative meeting and a food management committee, relying on the masses to implement democratic management. 2. Implement the principle of "eating well, eating good, and eating economically," vigorously adjust meals, and achieve "fine cooking of coarse grains, delicious cooking of fine grains," and especially study how to eat sweet potatoes. Actively expand the production of non-staple foods and establish specialized vegetable teams and livestock breeding farms. Currently, a large amount of dried vegetables should also be collected to prepare for the winter. Ensure that the elderly, young, sick, and women (pregnant) eat more fully and better, achieving satisfaction for everyone. 3. Implement class policies, conduct a rigorous review of the existing staff of public canteens, and remove all landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who have infiltrated; those who are not suitable for canteen work should be adjusted; select activists with a high degree of socialist and communist consciousness from among party members, league members, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants to serve as canteen managers and cooks; and educate them to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and constantly improve canteen work. It is also necessary to strengthen security and defense work to prevent sabotage by enemies and accidents such as corruption and waste. 4. Strengthen the cleaning and hygiene work of public canteens, and establish cleaning and hygiene committees based on canteens. Cooks must be healthy and free from infectious diseases; public canteens and cooking utensils must achieve "four nos" and "four cleans." The "four nos" are: no mosquitoes and flies, no rats, no dust, no sewage; the "four cleans" are: clean utensils, clean bowls and chopsticks, clean tables, and clean food. Separate dining halls and separate bowls and chopsticks should be provided for people with infectious diseases. 5. As the weather is getting colder day by day, people's communes should uniformly plan and quickly build some simple dining halls to serve as places for dining, meetings, learning, and entertainment. 6. Party committees at all levels should deeply discover and summarize advanced experiences in running public canteens well, convene on-site meetings to promote them; people's communes should regularly convene representative meetings of public canteens, organize and carry out friendship competitions, rely on the masses, fully promote democracy, and resolutely run public canteens well.

    保证吃饱吃好又节省
    河南普遍整顿公共食堂要求做到人人满意
    本报讯　中共河南省委指示各地认真加强领导，一定办好人民公社的公共食堂。
    河南省已举办起公共食堂二十六万九千多个，在公共食堂吃饭的已达到全省总人口的80％以上，占农村总人口的98％。农村人民公社并普遍推行了吃饭不要钱的粮食供给制或伙食供给制。各地中共组织早在人民公社化运动开始时，就注意加强了对于这项工作的领导。不少地区的中共党委都确定由一个书记或副书记专门领导整顿、巩固人民公社的公共食堂。中共新乡地委第一书记耿其昌亲自领导全区公共食堂普遍进行了检查和整顿，目前全区所有的食堂都普遍建立了专门照顾和满足老年人、病人、小孩、孕妇和客人等五种人的生活需要的小灶；并且都组织了专门的蔬菜生产专业队，经营起了可以充分满足食堂需要的小菜园，一般按人平均每人有将近二分菜地。原阳县在整顿前，全县有七百八十七个食堂管理得不够好，经过整顿，都能做到粗粮细吃，一般在五天或七天里吃饭不重样，每星期改善一次伙食，受到广大群众的欢迎。方城县和庄乡人民公社全社八十个食堂，在以“吃饱、吃好、吃省”为中心的红旗竞赛中，掀起了学先进、赶先进、超先进的办好食堂的高潮。经过两次评比，基本上消灭了落后食堂。
    为了更进一步巩固和办好公共食堂，中共河南省委在最近发出了认真办好公共食堂的指示，强调指出：一、各级党委必须实行书记挂帅，发动全党全民办好公共食堂。各级党委都要有一位书记负责，县以下成立生活福利部，地委以上建立生活福利办公室，专管此项工作。每个伙食单位都要建立伙食代表会和伙食管理委员会，依靠群众，实行民主管理。二、贯彻执行“吃饱、吃好、吃省”的原则，大力调剂好伙食，作到“粗粮细吃，细粮好吃”、“一种粮食做多种饭”，特别要研究红薯的吃法。积极扩大副食品生产，建立蔬菜专业队和畜牧饲养场。当前还要大量采集干菜，以备过冬。要保证老、幼、病、妇
  （孕）吃得更饱、更好，达到人人满意。三、贯彻执行阶级政策，对现有公共食堂的工作人员，进行一次严格审查，对混入的地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子等，一律清洗出去，不适宜作食堂工作的要进行调整；选拔具有高度社会主义和共产主义觉悟的党员、团员、贫农与下中农成份的积极分子，担任食堂的管理和炊事工作；并且教育他们虚心听取群众意见，不断改进食堂工作。还要加强治安保卫工作，防止敌人破坏和贪污浪费等事故发生。四、加强公共食堂的清洁卫生工作，以食堂为单位建立清洁卫生委员会。炊事人员必须是身体健康，无传染疾病的；公共食堂与炊事用具要做到“四无”“四净”。“四无”是：无蚊蝇、无老鼠、无灰尘、无污水；“四净”是：用具净、碗筷净、饭桌净、食物净。要为有传染病的人单设饭厅，单备碗筷。五、目前天气日渐寒冷，各人民公社应统一计划，迅速修盖一些简易饭厅，作为用饭、开会、学习和娱乐的场所。六、各级党委都要深入地发现和总结办好公共食堂的先进经验，召开现场会议进行推广；人民公社要经常召开公共食堂代表会议，组织和开展友谊竞赛，依靠群众，充分发扬民主，坚决地把公共食堂办好。
