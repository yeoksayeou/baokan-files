Advocate for "Small Rectification"
    Zhang Ke

Through several years of socialist education, the communist ideology of the broad masses of cadres and people has been greatly enhanced. This can be seen from the widespread cooperation and voluntary labor in production in various regions this year, and even more so from the spirit of great selflessness manifested in the current people's commune movement.

However, this does not mean that individualistic and departmentalist thinking has been completely eliminated in the people's commune movement. It should be understood that communist ideology grows in constant struggle with departmentalism and individualism. This struggle is long-term, and it exists not only now but will also exist in the future.

The people's commune is a new and profound social transformation, which is more collective and more socialist than cooperativization, and will eventually eliminate the remnants of private ownership of the means of production. In a movement with such a revolutionary nature, there will inevitably be resistance from some people with capitalist ideological remnants and backward conservative ideas. The issue is to seize these ideological problems and solve them. Many people's communes have correctly adopted the practice of criticizing individualism and departmentalism and establishing communist ideology through extensive airing of views, big debates, and discussions in the process of establishing the communes. This is especially important among cadres.

However, views on this issue are not entirely consistent. Some people emphasize that they are too busy and short on time, and that ideological problems can be addressed later. As a result, they are busy dealing with specific economic problems from the beginning, which leads to more and more chaos and problems, affecting production and hindering the work of establishing the communes. Conversely, in places where attention is paid to ideological work, the effect is completely different. When the Yuejin and Yinghui agricultural cooperatives in Jinsi Town, a suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, merged into a commune, many disputes arose when discussing specific economic policies due to the unbalanced economic foundation of each cooperative. In addition to promptly organizing propaganda teams to promote the superiority and future plans of the people's commune to the masses, the town Party committee also launched debates and discussions among cadres, leading everyone to deal with these issues in the spirit of communism. As a result, the communist consciousness of cadres and the masses was greatly enhanced, they recognized the nature of the commune, and clearly defined policy boundaries. All specific economic issues such as distribution, debt repayment, and the handling of privately owned means of production were easily resolved.

Now work is very busy, and it is certainly impossible to spend too much time on meetings and debates. What about the future? It can be said with certainty that it will not be possible to devote a lot of time to specifically rectify the thinking of cadres. Mechanically separating ideological work from economic work, dedicating a period of time solely to work and a period of time solely to rectifying thinking, is not only impossible in terms of time, but also a subjective and dogmatic approach that is divorced from reality. Ideological problems arise in specific work, and specific work is carried out under the guidance of ideology. The two must be combined to achieve practical results.

Does solving ideological problems necessarily require a lot of time? Not necessarily. The Chayashan Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province, used the so-called "small rectification" method to solve some ideological problems of cadres in the process of establishing the commune. They sometimes spent half a day discussing ideological issues, and sometimes they debated before deploying work. This approach of first addressing the abstract and then the concrete, using the abstract to guide the concrete, not only solved ideological problems but also made it faster to solve work problems. Of course, it is impossible to completely solve all ideological problems in this half-day, but doing so regularly can solve problems in a timely manner, and the number of problems solved increases, and eventually all problems may be resolved. Therefore, this kind of "small rectification" is worth advocating.

The reason why the work of establishing communes in some places is not done well is not because of tight time and busy work, but because they do not solve ideological problems, but only deal with specific economic problems or welfare issues. As a result, neither ideological problems nor economic problems are solved well. Chairman Mao taught us: "If we do not pay attention to ideology and politics and are busy with affairs all day long, we will become economists and technicians who have lost their direction, which is very dangerous. ... Ideology and politics are the commander, the soul. As long as we relax our ideological and political work a little, economic and technical work will inevitably go astray." We should firmly remember this.

    提倡“小整风”
    张克
    经过几年来的社会主义教育，广大干部和群众的共产主义思想有了很大的提高。这从今年各地生产中的普遍协作和义务劳动可以看出，从目前人民公社化运动中所表现的大公无私精神更可以看出。
    但是，这并不是说在人民公社化运动中，个人主义和本位主义思想已经根本不存在了。要知道共产主义思想是在和本位主义、个人主义思想不断斗争中成长起来的，这种斗争是长期的，不仅现在有，将来还会有。
    人民公社化是一种新的深刻的社会变革，它比合作化要更加集体更加社会主义化，并且最后消灭生产资料私有制的残余。在带有这样革命性质的运动中，一定会遇到一些有资本主义思想残余和落后保守思想的人的抵制的。问题在于要抓住这些思想问题加以解决。许多人民公社在建社过程中，通过大鸣大放大辩论，批判个人主义和本位主义思想，树立共产主义思想的作法是对的。在干部中，尤其要这样做。
    然而，对这个问题的看法并不完全一致，有些人强调工作忙，时间紧，思想问题过些时候再说。因而工作一开始就忙于处理一些具体经济问题，结果越忙越乱，越忙越多，既影响了生产，又妨碍了建社工作。反之，凡是注意思想工作的地方，效果就与此截然两样。山西太原市郊晋祠镇跃进、迎辉等农业社并成公社时，由于各社经济基础不平衡，在讨论具体经济政策的时候，发生了很多争执。镇党委除了及时组织宣传队向群众宣传人民公社优越性和前景规划外，并发动干部开展鸣放辩论，领导大家以共产主义精神对待这些问题。结果，干部群众共产主义觉悟大大提高，认清了公社性质，划清了政策界限，所有分配、债务偿还、私有生产资料处理等具体经济问题，也就迎刃而解了。
    现在工作很忙，固然不可能用过多时间来开会、辩论，将来怎样呢？肯定地说，也不可能拿出很多时间来专门整顿干部思想。把思想工作和经济工作机械地截然分开，一段时间专搞工作，一段时间专整思想，不仅时间上不允许，而且是脱离实际的主观主义做法。思想问题是在具体工作中产生的，具体工作是在思想指导下进行的，两者必须结合进行才能收到实效。
    解决思想问题是不是非要花费很多的时间呢？不一定。河南遂平县嵖岈山卫星人民公社在建社过程中，就曾用所谓“小整风”的办法解决了一些干部思想问题。他们有时用一半天时间来谈思想问题，有时就在布置工作之前辩论一番。这种先虚后实，以虚带实，不仅解决了思想问题，也使工作问题解决得更快。当然在这一半天的时间里，不可能把所有思想问题都解决得很彻底，但是经常这样做，就能够及时解决问题，而且解决的问题越来越多，最后问题有可能得到全部解决。因此，这种“小整风”是值得提倡的。
    有些地方的建社工作做得不大好，并不是由于时间紧、工作忙，而是因为他们不去解决思想问题，只去处理具体经济问题或福利问题。结果，思想问题、经济问题都没有解决好。毛主席教导我们说：“不注意思想和政治，成天忙于事务，那会成为迷失方向的经济家和技术家，很危险。……思想和政治又是统帅，是灵魂。只要我们的思想工作和政治工作稍为一放松，经济工作和技术工作就一定会走到邪路上去。”我们应该牢牢地记住。
