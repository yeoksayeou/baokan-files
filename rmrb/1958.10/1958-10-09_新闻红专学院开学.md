News Red and Expert College Opens

    This newspaper reports that the News Red and Expert College, sponsored by the All-China Journalists Association, began classes on the 8th. The first lesson was given by Comrade Xiang Shengchang, a sergeant squad leader from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, on "How I Study Philosophy."

    The college's mission is to help editors and reporters currently employed by news organizations in the capital improve their Marxist-Leninist theory and journalistic skills. The teaching method emphasizes combining theory with practice and learning with work. Before the end of this year, there will be three courses: Philosophy, Journalism, and Grammar and Rhetoric. Next year, courses in Literature, Logic, and others will be added.

    Philosophy will primarily focus on studying Chairman Mao's works. The college has hired Deng Tuo, Sun Dingguo, Hu Sheng, and others as philosophy instructors, and will invite Party committee secretaries working at the grassroots level, as well as workers, peasants, and cadres who have achieved significant success in studying philosophy, to give reports. The journalism course will mainly summarize the experiences of various news organizations during the Great Leap Forward, and will be taught by people in the news industry with practical work experience. The Grammar and Rhetoric course will be taught by Zhu Dexi, a teacher from Peking University. The college currently has more than 1,200 students, with classes held once or twice a week.

    Comrade Wu Lengxi serves concurrently as the president of the college, with Comrades An Gang, Wang Mo, and Lu Minggu serving concurrently as vice presidents.

    新闻红专学院开学
    本报讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会举办的新闻红专学院于8日开始上课。第一课由解放军某部中士班长向胜昌同志讲“我是怎样学哲学的”。
    学院的任务是帮助首都各新闻单位在职的编辑、记者提高马列主义理论和新闻业务水平。在教学方法上强调理论与实践相结合、学习与工作相结合。今年年前暂设哲学、新闻业务、语法修词三门课程，明年将增设文学、逻辑学等课。
    哲学以学习毛主席的著作为主。学院聘请邓拓、孙定国、胡绳等任哲学教员，并将请基层工作的党委书记和工人、农民、在职干部中学习哲学有显著成绩的人作报告。新闻业务课主要是总结各新闻单位大跃进中的经验，由新闻界有实际工作经验的人做教员。语法修词课程由北京大学朱德熙教员任教。学院现有学员一千二百多人，每周上课一至二次。
    学院由吴冷西同志兼院长、安岗、王谟、卢鸣谷同志兼副院长。
