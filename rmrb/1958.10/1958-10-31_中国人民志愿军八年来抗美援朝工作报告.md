The Chinese People's Volunteers, the finest sons and daughters sent by the motherland, have now all returned home after eight years of fighting in Korea to aid the Koreans and resist the Americans. The complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea marks the successful completion of the great historical mission assigned to them by the motherland. I am now representing the Chinese People's Volunteers to report briefly on our eight-year struggle in Korea to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and to the people of our motherland.

On June 25, 1950, the American imperialists instigated their puppet, the Lee Syngman clique, to launch a long-planned attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Soon after, the American imperialists rallied their own forces and those of fifteen other vassal states, flying the "United Nations" flag, to join this criminal war of aggression. They sought to annihilate the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in one stroke and to expand the war into China, spreading the flames of war across the globe. The American imperialists' invasion of Taiwan at the same time as they launched the Korean War is the most compelling evidence of this.

The Chinese people love peace. After the outbreak of the Korean War, our government repeatedly advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and demanded that U.S. forces withdraw from Taiwan and immediately cease the war of aggression in Korea. Our country needed a peaceful environment to restore its national economy, which had been devastated by long years of war, and to develop industry, agriculture, culture, education, and other construction projects. However, the Chinese people, who had stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and our great leader Chairman Mao, have never been afraid of imperialist wars of aggression imposed on us. As early as the beginning of the Korean War, Chairman Mao called on us to "unite and make full preparations to defeat any provocation by American imperialism." After the American invaders landed at Incheon on the west coast of Korea on September 30, 1950, their madness reached its peak. On September 30, 1950, Premier Zhou Enlai sternly warned the American invaders, "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression and cannot stand idly by while imperialists aggress against their neighbors." However, the American imperialists saw the Chinese people's desire for peace as a sign of weakness and ignored our government's stern warnings. They crossed the 38th Parallel in force, advancing to our borders, and sent their invading air force to brazenly enter our northeastern airspace, bombing our cities and countryside, killing our compatriots, and destroying our property, thereby directing the spearhead of their war of aggression directly at our northeast. Our security was seriously threatened. In this intolerable situation, to support our neighboring country, which is closely tied to us, and to defend our homeland, we formed the Volunteer Army, raised the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," crossed the Yalu River, and joined the Korean People's Army in fighting the savage American invaders.

To cover up their own crimes of aggression, the American imperialists actually turned black into white, slandering the Chinese People's Volunteers' just actions of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Homeland" as an invasion of Korea. The United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, shamefully slandered our country as conducting aggression in Korea. This slander has been completely shattered by the victories achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the great struggle to resist America and aid Korea.

Together with the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, after three years of hard fighting under extremely difficult material conditions, with unparalleled courage and tenacity and astonishing perseverance, repelled the American invaders and their mercenary armies. In three years of war, the Korean and Chinese people's armies together annihilated 1,090,000 enemy troops, including 390,000 American soldiers; shot down and damaged more than 12,000 enemy aircraft; and destroyed and captured more than 3,000 tanks. The American invaders, flying the "United Nations" flag, after suffering a crushing defeat, had no choice but to sign the armistice agreement.

The Korean War proved that people who love peace, if they want to obtain peace, must resolutely fight against imperialist aggressors, and that warmongers will not easily give up until they receive the necessary lessons. As the joint declaration issued by the various democratic parties in China on November 4, 1950, and known worldwide, said: "If the people of the world who love peace want to obtain peace, they must actively resist violence and stop aggression. Only resistance can make imperialists learn their lesson, and only then can the issue of independence and liberation in Korea and other regions be resolved justly according to the will of the people."

The combined might of the Chinese and Korean armies inflicted on the United States "the greatest defeat in the history of the U.S. Army."

Now, let us briefly review the history of the Korean War.

At the beginning of the Korean War, our enemies were so arrogant and reckless. The American imperialists' puppet, Lee Syngman, boasted that he would "complete the northern expedition in three days," and the U.S. commander in Korea, MacArthur, arrogantly claimed that he would end the Korean War before Thanksgiving. When the American invaders approached the Yalu River, they proudly issued such absurd boasts: "In history, the Yalu River has not been an insurmountable barrier separating China and Korea." However, the facts shattered their illusions. The American imperialists' mad aggression was met from the start with the resolute resistance of the brave Korean people defending their country's independence and freedom. After the Chinese People's Volunteers suddenly appeared on the Korean battlefield, they continuously struck heavy blows against the American invaders, causing them to suffer repeated defeats and rapidly changing the balance of power and the course of the war. From October 25, 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers entered Korea to fight, to late May 1951, in just over half a year, together with the Korean People's Army, they launched five offensive campaigns, achieving five victories and annihilating more than 220,000 enemy troops. Thus, they drove the American invaders and their fifteen vassal states' armies, along with the Lee Syngman clique, back from the Yalu River to their original starting point of aggression—the 38th Parallel. After that, although the American invaders desperately struggled, with the passage of time and the increasingly heavy blows they received, their plans fell through and their illusions were shattered. They no longer discussed when they could achieve victory but had to admit that this Korean War was "the greatest defeat in the history of the U.S. Army" and "the most complete defeat the United States had ever suffered."

The American invaders, who saw no hope of victory, under the heavy blows of the increasingly strong Korean and Chinese people's armies and the increasingly strong public opinion of the people of the world who love peace, had to go against their own intentions to expand the war of aggression and were forced to accept the Soviet government's peace initiative, agreeing to hold armistice talks. On July 10, 1951, armistice talks began in Kaesong, the ancient capital of Korea. From then on, a sharp and complex struggle began, combining military and diplomatic efforts and influencing each other. The American imperialists were not willing to accept the forced peace. In the talks, they neither acknowledged their military defeat nor were willing to solve the Korean issue fairly and reasonably with a spirit of equal consultation. They used the absurd excuse of "compensating for air and naval superiority" to try to obtain at the negotiating table what they could not get on the battlefield. When their blackmail policy and unreasonable demands were rejected by the Korean and Chinese sides, they proposed, "Let the bombs, cannons, and machine guns do the talking!" It is clear that the American invaders intended to use the armistice talks to cover up military attacks and use military pressure to force us to surrender.

The Chinese people want peace. We have always advocated reaching an agreement to peacefully resolve the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis. However, if the American invaders do not give up their unreasonable demands and plans to expand aggression and insist on continuing the war, we will follow Chairman Mao's teachings and fight alongside the Korean people until the end. Chairman Mao said: "If American imperialism wants to fight for many years, we will also be prepared to fight for many years, until American imperialism is willing to stop, until the Chinese and Korean people achieve complete victory."

In mid-August 1951, just as the armistice talks had been going on for about a month, the American invaders launched the summer offensive; after the summer offensive, they launched the autumn offensive. However, the American invaders, as the saying goes, "lifted a rock only to drop it on their own feet." Not only did they fail to subdue the Korean and Chinese people, but they also suffered even more tragic defeats. In this period, the Korean and Chinese people's armies, on a 250-kilometer-wide front across Korea, built an impregnable defensive line—the underground Great Wall. Under the guidance of the strategy of persistent warfare and active defense, they used tenacious defensive battles to stop the American invaders' attacks and stabilized the front line near the 38th Parallel. At the same time, they actively organized continuous counterattacks, severely striking and annihilating the enemy. In the autumn and winter of 1951, the Korean and Chinese people's armies annihilated 250,000 enemy troops, exceeding the total number of enemy troops annihilated in the five campaigns, and the enemy crawled 2 to 9 kilometers, suffering 250,000 casualties. This was the conclusion of the "debate" of "bombs, cannons, and machine guns."

The American invaders are "not crying until they see the coffin." After suffering heavy defeats on the ground, they relied on their so-called "air superiority" to launch a so-called strangulation campaign aimed at destroying our rear and supply lines. They used tens of thousands of aircraft and tens of thousands of tons of bombs to bomb our rear facilities, railways, roads, and bridges day and night. The enemy's "strangulation campaign" caused us serious damage. However, with the full support of the people of our motherland and the Korean people, relying on the broad masses of soldiers and officers, especially the railway troops, engineering troops, logistics troops, public security troops, tens of thousands of heroic drivers, and anti-aircraft troops, relying on their unparalleled courage and boundless wisdom, we formed an indestructible steel transportation line, overcame all difficulties, consolidated the rear, and ensured the supply to the front. Thus, the enemy's carefully planned "strangulation campaign" was completely shattered. Even the then commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Van Fleet, had to admit: "Although the allied air force and navy exerted all their efforts to block the supply of the communists, the communists still transported supplies to the front line with incredible tenacity, creating a miraculous feat."

In early January 1952, the American invaders, in violation of humanity and international conventions, used inhumane bacteriological weapons in North Korea and our northeast, attempting to destroy our people, livestock, and crops through various pathogenic bacteria, fundamentally exhausting the resistance of the Korean and Chinese people. However, the flies, mosquitoes, beetles, and rats carrying the bacteria could not save the doomed American invaders. With the help of experts sent by our motherland to Korea, we mobilized the wisdom of the masses to launch a vigorous anti-epidemic and sanitation campaign, using various methods to defeat the American invaders' plots and ensure the health of the military and civilians. At the same time, a massive patriotic sanitation campaign was launched in our motherland. The bacteriological war was finally completely shattered by us. Apart from suffering heavy political and moral defeats and being branded as "bacteriological criminals" and "bacteriological generals," the American imperialists gained nothing else.

By this point, the American imperialists had used everything except atomic weapons on the Korean battlefield. On October 8, 1952, the American side unilaterally announced the suspension of armistice talks. Just a week later, on October 14, the American invaders began a large-scale attack. The enemy's goal this time was to first seize Hill 597, then seize Hill 537, aiming to break through a gap in our defensive line, force our army to retreat, and create a favorable position for themselves in the negotiations. The Battle of Hill 597 showed that the enemy was struggling desperately, and on the hill, which was defended by only two companies of our troops covering less than 3.7 square kilometers, the enemy successively committed more than six divisions of over 60,000 troops, deployed 18 artillery battalions, dispatched more than 3,000 sorties of aircraft, and used 178 tanks. In the 43-day battle, the enemy launched more than 900 assaults, firing 1.9 million shells and heavy bombs. This was the most concentrated artillery fire in the history of warfare. The hill was reduced by two meters, and the rocks were blasted into powder more than a meter thick. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce and brutal. However, due to the strengthening of the Chinese People's Volunteers by the nationwide donation movement, with strong artillery support, relying on the trenches as the backbone of the positions, in defensive battles, we used the rich experience accumulated over two years, demonstrated high revolutionary heroism, and finally ended the world-renowned Battle of Hill 597 with our victory and the enemy's defeat.

To force the American invaders to accept the armistice, to strike at the American invaders who detained our prisoners of war and violated the prisoner repatriation agreement, and to strike at the Lee Syngman clique, which arrogantly boasted of wanting to "go it alone," from mid-May 1953, our army, in close coordination with the Korean People's Army, launched a powerful summer offensive. In the two-and-a-half-month campaign, on a 20-kilometer-wide front, we conducted 133 attacks, recaptured 240 square kilometers of land, and annihilated more than 120,000 enemy troops.

The American invaders and the Lee Syngman clique signed the armistice agreement only under the heavy blows of the powerful attacks of the Korean and Chinese people's armies. At that time, the so-called commander of the United Nations forces, Clark, could not help but say sadly: "I am the first American general to sign an armistice agreement without achieving victory."

Thus, the largest and most brutal war of aggression launched by American imperialism after World War II was defeated by the Korean and Chinese people. Its claws were cut off, the flames of war were extinguished, and the violent acts of disturbing peace were stopped. Its boasted "policy of strength" was bankrupt, the true face of the paper tiger was exposed, and the myth of invincibility was shattered.

The Korean and Chinese people solemnly declared to the world with ironclad facts: The era of imperialist hegemony has passed.

The historical fact of the American invaders' defeat in Korea has profound significance for us, our friends, and our enemies.

How did the American imperialists, who considered themselves "invincible in the world," be defeated by the Korean and Chinese people, whom they did not consider strong? In terms of the economy, the United States was the largest industrial power in the capitalist world. If we consider steel production, which is of great significance to war, the United States' output was a hundred times that of ours at the time. During the Korean War, the United States spent more than $20 billion on direct war expenses and transported 7,300,000 tons of war materials to Korea. It can be said that the United States could afford even more. In terms of military strength, it not only committed one-third of its army, one-fifth of its air force, and most of its navy as the main force in the Korean War but also gathered the forces of fifteen vassal states on the Korean battlefield. In terms of military equipment, the disparity between the enemy and us was enormous. The American imperialists used almost all modern weapons except atomic bombs and always had "air and naval superiority." The Chinese People's Volunteers, at the beginning of the war, had no aircraft participating in frontline combat and only a few cannons. It was only after the people of our motherland launched the movement to support the Korean War that we formed our own air force and strengthened our artillery, but we still did not fundamentally change the conditions of enemy superiority and our inferiority. In terms of command, although the United States had changed its commanders three times, whether it was MacArthur, who was dismissed for defeat, General Ridgeway, who used bacteriological warfare, or Clark, who had to sign the armistice agreement after suffering repeated defeats, they were not "generals without war experience" and could not be simply evaluated as "incompetent commanders." The "United Nations forces" participating in the Korean War, under their command, had used lightning attacks, the Incheon landing, the "strangulation campaign" to paralyze our transportation lines, inhumane bacteriological warfare, and various tactics and strategies. These tactics were not without poison. However, in the face of the Korean and Chinese people's armies, they were still powerless. In summary, in terms of economic strength, military strength, and technological equipment, the advantage was obviously not in our hands. Then, why did the outcome of the Korean War turn out to be the opposite of what American imperialism had expected, ending with the victory of the Korean and Chinese people and the defeat of American imperialism? Why did the side that was inferior in these aspects defeat the side that was superior? This is something that imperialism cannot understand.

The outcome of the Korean War, with the enemy's superior and our inferior equipment, was not due to some accidental cause resulting in an accidental outcome. This was the inevitable result of the full play of the necessary factors that determine victory and defeat in the struggle between the forces of peace and war, the forces of socialism and imperialism. The decisive factor in determining victory and defeat in war is the "nature of the war" and the "hearts and minds of the people." The power of the people is invincible. In this decisive factor, all the advantages were entirely in our hands. In the battle, we received the full support of the great people of our motherland. The people of our motherland made every effort to meet our needs in terms of personnel, weapons, equipment, and supplies and gave us great concern and encouragement in spirit. In the battle alongside the brave Korean People's Army, we received great support from the brotherly Korean people, the close care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government, and we forged a close friendship with the Korean people with our blood. In the struggle, we received the active support of the people of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and the support of the people of the world who love peace. This support and assistance have always inspired us to fight. These are the keys to our final victory over the enemy in the war.

Of course, it should also be pointed out that the outcome of our inevitable victory and the enemy's inevitable defeat is the result of the full play of the above-mentioned objective conditions and the subjective efforts of those who directly participated in the war. We do not deny at all that in the Korean War, due to the enemy's brutality and the enemy's superiority in military equipment, we faced great difficulties. However, the Chinese People's Volunteers, armed with patriotism and internationalism, together with the Korean People's Army, demonstrated unyielding will, heroism to defeat all enemies, and noble qualities to overcome all difficulties in the battle. Our commanders at all levels armed themselves with Chairman Mao's military thought, correctly used the rich combat experience accumulated by our people in their long struggle against internal and external enemies, and flexibly used the strategies and tactics of people's war and people's army according to the characteristics of the Korean War. In the course of the war, all soldiers and officers made great efforts to fully develop and strengthen the advantages of our army, utilize and expand the enemy's weaknesses. Thus, the Korean War could not help but end with our victory and the enemy's defeat.

The historical fact that the American imperialists, who launched the war of aggression, were defeated by the Korean and Chinese people, who had just been liberated, is meaningful and educational for us, our friends, and our enemies. We and our friends can be inspired by reviewing this history because the outcome of the Korean War vividly tells us: All the people of the world who love peace, as long as they fight resolutely, the imperialist aggressors will inevitably suffer the same shameful defeat as they did in Korea. Imperialists who are enemies of the people of the world who love peace and strive for national independence, before they raise their butcher's knives, whether they like it or not, must review the historical lessons they learned in the Korean War.

From the Korean armistice to now, only five years have passed, but the domestic and international situation has undergone extremely profound changes. The socialist construction of our great motherland is developing at a giant's pace, at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." The socialist camp led by the Soviet Union has become unprecedentedly united and strong. The anti-colonial struggle and national independence movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have formed an irresistible tide. We deeply feel that the world situation has entered the era of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind as Chairman Mao has judged. Five years ago, we were able to defeat American imperialism under the extremely unequal conditions of economic strength and military equipment. Therefore, in the situation that has fundamentally changed today, we, based on the practical experience of the Korean War, firmly believe in what Chairman Mao and Khrushchev said in the joint statement: "If the imperialist warmongers dare to impose war on the people of the world, then all the countries and peoples who love peace and freedom will closely unite, completely eliminate the imperialist aggressors, and lay the foundation for permanent world peace."

In the Korean battlefield, we drove the American invaders back to where they originally launched the war and forced them to accept the armistice. This is a great victory for the Korean and Chinese people and a common victory for all the people of the world who love peace. The Korean armistice, as stated in the armistice order issued by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Commander Peng Dehuai, "The signing of the armistice agreement is the first step towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and is therefore beneficial to the peace of the Far East and the world. It has been warmly supported by the people of the two countries, China and Korea, and has greatly inspired all the people of the world who love peace." However, to ensure that all the provisions of the armistice agreement are strictly observed and implemented, there have been no obstacles.

Fighting against the U.S.-Lee clique's violation of the armistice agreement, maintaining vigilance, and shattering the enemy's plot to restart the war.

The American representative signed the Korean armistice agreement, but the American Wall Street monopolists, in order to reap high profits from maintaining a tense situation and expanding military preparations, from the day the armistice agreement was signed, have consistently used various despicable means to sabotage the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, since the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean people have had to continue the struggle against American imperialism. This is a struggle to maintain the Korean armistice and to oppose the sabotage of the Korean armistice, a struggle to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This struggle is sharp, long-term, and relates to the peace of the Far East and the world.

On the eve of the signing of the armistice agreement, some warmongers in the United States had supported South Korea's Lee Syngman to loudly advocate against the armistice. Lee Syngman, this "hero" in the American goldfish bowl, openly threatened to "go it alone," to "adopt a unilateral policy," and to "unify Korea by force." Lee Syngman, under the pretext of "local release," created an incident of forcibly detaining our prisoners of war, attempting to obstruct the path to reaching the armistice agreement with this thug tactic. It was only because the Korean and Chinese people adopted a firm policy of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and gave a resolute blow that Lee Syngman's plot did not succeed.

The ink on the armistice agreement was not yet dry when Dulles signed the "U.S.-South Korean Mutual Defense Treaty" with Lee Syngman, stipulating that U.S. troops had the right to stay in South Korea indefinitely. In reality, it was an attempt to resist the armistice agreement and to stay in South Korea indefinitely. Following this, the Lee Syngman clique, with unprecedented beastly brutality, obstructed the exercise of repatriation rights by the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, violated the prisoner of war agreement, and also violated the bilateral talks on the political conference, making it impossible to hold the political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement. In short, he used every means to sabotage all the provisions of the armistice agreement related to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, attempting to keep Korea in a state of permanent division. He repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, insulted and threatened the commission's personnel. To evade inspections of his sabotage of the armistice agreement, the U.S. side even unilaterally announced and forced the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's inspection team to withdraw from South Korea on May 31, 1956. He repeatedly provoked incidents in the demilitarized zone, violating the armistice agreement. He violated the armistice agreement by frequently smuggling various weapons into South Korea, strengthening the equipment of the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman puppet army. In the second half of last year, American imperialism had already transformed its two divisions stationed in South Korea into atomic divisions and expanded the Lee Syngman puppet army from sixteen divisions to twenty-one divisions. In June 1957, the U.S. side even unilaterally announced the abolition of Article 13, Item 4 of the Korean Armistice Agreement and immediately transported F-100 jet fighters, 280mm caliber atomic cannons, and "Honest John" rockets and other new weapons into South Korea. These facts show that American imperialism, in violation of the armistice agreement, is turning South Korea into its atomic war base.

Since the armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have, on the one hand, strictly observed all the provisions of the armistice agreement, and on the other hand, have firmly fought against all the U.S. and Lee Syngman clique's acts of sabotaging the armistice agreement.

Peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is the consistent stance of the Korean and Chinese people, but for the imperialist who is accustomed to aggression and betrayal, we must remain highly vigilant. Therefore, after the armistice, all soldiers and officers of the Volunteers established a firm "persist in the long-term struggle to resist America and aid Korea" mindset, vigilantly guarding the frontline of the socialist camp in the east—the 38th Parallel, vigilantly defending the peace of the Far East. We closely monitored the enemy and maintained combat readiness at all times. Over the years, the soldiers of the Volunteers, regardless of the winter's wind and snow or the summer's heat and rain, day and night, climbed mountains and crossed valleys, patrolled and stood guard. Over the years, due to the high vigilance and readiness of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, although the enemy carried out a series of provocations, they were all exposed and foiled by us, thus maintaining the relative stability of the armistice situation. From July 27, 1953, when the armistice agreement was signed, to July 27, 1958, in these five years, the U.S.-Lee military violated the armistice agreement 792 times, and in the same period, we captured 700 enemy spies sent through the demilitarized zone and the sea. The Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission had conducted multiple investigations into the U.S. and Lee Syngman's violations of the armistice agreement, and each time the U.S. representative was in a sorry state in the face of ironclad evidence. All of this not only exposed the enemy's plots in a timely manner, shattered their arrogant plans to restart the war, but also forced American imperialism to admit its violations of the armistice agreement in front of the people of the world, making it suffer a moral defeat. After the U.S.-Lee military's violations of the armistice agreement were exposed, the U.S. representative also used thug tactics to fabricate so-called "violations of the agreement" by our side, but because he could not produce any evidence, he only added to his shame in the face of truth and morality. Because the Korean and Chinese sides have always strictly observed and implemented the provisions of the armistice agreement since the armistice, justice has always been firmly in our hands, and this is our powerful weapon to strike against the enemy's sabotage of the armistice agreement. Therefore, we have always been in a position of advantage and initiative.

The withdrawal of the Volunteers shows that the power of peace is greater than the power of war, and the power of socialism is greater than the power of imperialism. If the enemy dares to launch a new adventure, it will be shattered.

Moreover, to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Korean and Chinese sides have also taken a series of important initiatives. After the United States refused to convene the political conference stipulated in the armistice agreement in 1953, the governments of the two countries repeatedly suggested holding a conference of relevant countries to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had proposed to the South Korean authorities to reduce the forces of South and North Korea to 100,000 or fewer each. After the South Korean authorities rejected this, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea unilaterally took the action of reducing its forces by 80,000 in 1956. The Chinese People's Volunteers, to show our sincerity in resolving the Korean issue peacefully and to further ease the tension in the Far East, voluntarily withdrew nineteen divisions from Korea between 1954 and 1955. The Korean government had repeatedly proposed reasonable suggestions for the trade, free movement of people, communication, and cultural exchange between South and North Korea, but all these suggestions, which fully conform to the interests of the Korean people, were rejected by American imperialism and the Lee Syngman clique. Under the actions of the United States, the people of South Korea continue to suffer, the entire Korean people continue to suffer from division, and the Korean issue remains unresolved, the tense situation has not been eliminated, and the peace of the Far East and the world continues to be threatened.

The resolution of the Korean issue should be left to the Korean people to solve on their own without external interference. The withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea is a prerequisite for the peaceful reunification of Korea. On February 5, 1958, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea, proposing that all foreign troops withdraw from Korea. On February 7, our government issued a statement fully supporting this major peace initiative of the Korean government. Subsequently, the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai, during its visit to Korea, held talks with the Korean government delegation led by Premier Kim Il-sung, and on February 19, 1958, issued a joint statement on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers issued a statement on February 20, 1958, on the complete withdrawal from Korea in 1958. In the statement, we said: "All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers fully support the proposal of our government and decide to withdraw from Korea in batches by the end of 1958." Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have faithfully carried out their promise and completely withdrawn from Korea.

The actual action of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea powerfully proves the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese governments and people in resolving the Korean issue peacefully. This measure has been widely praised and supported by all the countries and peoples of the world who love peace, and it has greatly inspired their struggle to maintain peace and oppose war.

Now, the question before American imperialism is: Should they comply with the peace demands of the world, respect the Korean people's wish to reunify their country peacefully, and withdraw their troops from Korea? Or should they continue to occupy South Korea, making the Korean people continue to suffer from division? Because of our withdrawal from Korea, world public opinion will force American imperialism to make a choice. If American imperialism stubbornly refuses to withdraw its troops of aggression from South Korea, it will never be able to escape the responsibility of obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea.

In the situation where the U.S. invading army is still occupying South Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers resolutely and completely withdrew from Korea. This initiative is determined by the situation where the power of peace is greater than the power of war and the power of socialism is greater than the power of imperialism; it is a manifestation of the Korean and Chinese people's confidence in their own strength and in the cause of maintaining peace.

The three-year Korean War has already proven that the Korean and Chinese people, who bravely fought to resist aggression, defend their homeland, and safeguard peace, are invincible. If the American invaders and the Lee Syngman clique regard the Korean and Chinese people's great action to promote peace as a sign of weakness, thinking they have an opportunity, daring to defy the world and launch a new adventure, they will make a great mistake again and will inevitably suffer a crushing counterattack from the Korean and Chinese people.

As long as the Korean people and the Korean government deem it necessary, the finest sons and daughters of the Chinese people will cross the Yalu River again.

The growing strength of the Korean people is the fundamental guarantee for maintaining peace in Korea and striving for the peaceful reunification of Korea. Although the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea have suffered severe destruction at the hands of American imperialism, we have personally witnessed: under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and Premier Kim Il-sung, with the aid of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries, the Korean people, with their hardworking hands and indomitable spirit, have overcome numerous difficulties, healed the wounds of war, and rebuilt peaceful lives. The Korean people completed the three-year economic recovery plan after the war as early as 1956, restoring and surpassing pre-war levels of industrial and agricultural production. Starting from 1957, the Korean people, in accordance with the basic directions set by the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, began implementing the first five-year plan. The economic construction of the Korean people has entered a new stage. Now, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has achieved tremendous successes in political, economic, and cultural construction. They have established their own bases for heavy and light industries and completed agricultural collectivization. The total industrial output of Korea this year will increase to about 4.7 times that of 1948, and grain production will increase by 100 million tons. With the development of the economy, education, science, and cultural undertakings have also made tremendous progress. The entire labor force, riding on the wings of the Chollima, is advancing along the broad path of socialism with boundless enthusiasm. The great achievements of the Korean people in socialist construction, combined with the strong military and political qualities of the heroic Korean People's Army, which has been tempered by war, are the decisive guarantee for maintaining peace in Korea and striving for peaceful reunification. Now, North Korea is more consolidated than ever, becoming an iron wall; it will further inspire and promote the struggle of the people in South Korea against the U.S.-Lee regime.

In the past and in the future, the struggle of the Korean people is not isolated. Their just cause of national reunification, resistance to aggression, and defense of peace has the strong support of the Chinese people, the strong support of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, the support of the increasingly high anti-imperialist struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the support of peace-loving people around the world. They are invincible, and their just cause will surely triumph.

Although the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn from Korea, our people continue to care about the common cause of resisting aggression, defending peace, and building socialism with the Korean people. The Chinese people will always stand with the fraternal Korean people. The statement of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers has solemnly declared to the people of the world: "If American imperialism and its followers dare to violate the dignity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and launch another war of aggression against Korea, then as long as the Korean people and government deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their finest sons across the Yalu River again to fight alongside the Korean People's Army to crush the enemy's aggression." Korea and China are as close as lips and teeth. The Chinese people will always be the most reliable and powerful backing for the Korean people.

In the great struggle against American aggression, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples has been further strengthened and developed. During the days when the Chinese People's Volunteers fought side by side with the Korean people and the People's Army, we shared joys and sorrows, faced hardships together, cooperated closely, and supported each other. The blood of Chinese and Korean soldiers flowed together, and we jointly won victory. After the armistice was realized, we continued to fight resolutely with American imperialism to maintain the armistice agreement, strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and defend the peace of the Far East and the world. At the same time, we actively participated in the labor of the Korean people to restore the economy and build socialism. The Korean people, on the other hand, have always shown boundless enthusiasm and a high spirit of internationalism, caring for and fully supporting us. Eight years of living together, we have become as close as family. This is the deep feeling of each of us.

The Chinese People's Volunteers are armed with a combination of high patriotism and internationalism. This is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings, the result of the long-term revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, and also the result of the savage brutality of our enemies. When American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it also occupied Chinese territory in Taiwan, drove its invading army to the Chinese border, bombed Chinese cities and villages, killed Chinese civilians, and threatened Chinese security. This made it even clearer that to defend the motherland, we must resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is to defend the motherland. The Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the Yalu River and personally saw the deep suffering that American imperialism had inflicted on the Korean people. Fertile fields lay in ruins, cities and villages became ruins, young people were taken away, women were raped, and thousands of patriots and unarmed people were massacred. Facing the beastly crimes of the Americans and these unbearable scenes, the soldiers' hearts burned with indignation. They deeply realized that American imperialism was not only the enemy of the Korean people but also the enemy of all Chinese and all humanity; the suffering of the Korean people was also our own and the suffering of all humanity.

We firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions:
To cherish every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea.

The patriotic and internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Volunteers was continuously enhanced and strengthened during the war. Hatred for the enemy, boundless sympathy for the Korean people, and a high sense of responsibility for defending the motherland's security and world peace formed an inexhaustible source of strength for every soldier, forming the revolutionary heroism and invincible spirit of every soldier. As early as 1951, the former commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Peng Dehuai, had written an article praising this spirit, stating: "The entire command and combat personnel of the Volunteers have shown unparalleled bravery and endurance and astonishing hard work and perseverance in battle. In the offensive, they fearlessly advanced despite the enemy's fierce artillery fire, forgetting all fatigue and hardship, climbing mountains and crossing rivers; in defense, they remained steadfast and calm despite the enemy's bombing and shelling, firmly holding their positions and killing a large number of enemies; even in situations where the enemy's forces were overwhelmingly superior, they remained fearless and unyielding, fighting to the last man and not abandoning their positions. Many wounded soldiers, despite their injuries, continued to fight on the battlefield. Many martyrs, even in their final moments, encouraged their comrades to advance bravely, defeat the aggressors, and achieve victory. The command and combat personnel of the Volunteers have fought continuously for days and nights in severe cold of minus thirty degrees, with snow several feet deep on the high mountains; they have crossed icy rivers under enemy fire to capture enemy defensive positions; they have endured hunger and hardship but still resolutely completed their combat missions."

During the three-year war, more than 300,000 heroes emerged, including the famous hero Yang Gensheng, who led a platoon to repel the enemy's nine attacks and finally rushed into the enemy ranks with an explosive package; the famous hero Huang Jiguang, who used his chest to block the enemy's machine gun fire to cover his comrades' advance; the hero Li Jianfa, who was like Huang Jiguang; the famous hero Hu Xiudao, who led two soldiers to repel the enemy's forty-one attacks and killed 280 enemies; the lone hero Chen Fusheng, who fearlessly fought alone; the mine-clearing hero Yao Xianru; the lone hero Lai Yongze, who fought alone for three days and nights, killing more than 100 enemies, and finally fought with stones against the enemy; Li Yunfeng and Luo Weixin, who, in an emergency, bravely threw themselves onto the enemy's barbed wire to build a human bridge for the advancing troops; Qiu Shaochun, who, for the greater good, endured the flames while lying in ambush and strictly followed the ambush discipline; and the famous hero Sun Zhanyuan, who, after his leg was shot off, still commanded the battle and detonated the last grenade, rolling towards the enemy and perishing with the enemy. Countless heroic figures and their earth-shaking revolutionary heroism are the shining symbols of patriotism and internationalism for our entire army.

The Chinese People's Volunteers, whether in extremely difficult wartime or in the years after the armistice, have always followed Chairman Mao's instructions to "cherish every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea." Over the past eight years, the entire army has not only set an example in discipline but has also, during battles and training, frequently helped the Korean people with spring plowing, autumn harvest, irrigation, afforestation, house building, medical treatment, disease prevention, and disaster relief. Especially after the armistice, the soldiers, without even brushing off the dust of war, rushed to the construction sites of important cities such as Pyongyang, Hamhung, and Sinuiju, and to the vast countryside, with the same enthusiasm as building their own country, actively participating in the construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Their slogan was: "The construction site is the battlefield," "The more sweat we shed, the deeper the friendship," and "Build Pyongyang with the same heart as building Beijing." Their labor enthusiasm was as vigorous as their morale on the battlefield. A soldier's poem reflects their precious spirit:

For the friendship dam,
No matter how tired, we don't fear;
We take off our clothes and socks,
Dive into the water to dig the mud;
Mud and water cover our bodies,
We don't care about it;
Sweat pours like rain,
Watering the flowers of friendship.

Over the past eight years, according to incomplete statistics, we have helped the Korean people build 881 public facilities, 45,412 civilian houses, restored and built 4,263 large and small bridges, built 4,096 dikes totaling 429,220 meters, built 2,295 large and small irrigation canals totaling 1,218,710 meters, participated in 852,197,473 square meters of field labor, delivered 1,314,606 loads of fertilizer, planted 3,608,654 trees, and transported 63,853 tons of grain and materials. The soldiers treated the sufferings of the Korean people as if they were their own family's sufferings. Over the past eight years, especially during the war, the Volunteers' officers and soldiers saved clothing and food to help some local people survive the disaster. They treated 1,883,975 patients for the Korean people. The great internationalist soldier Luo Shengtao is a shining example of our army's internationalism.

Since the Volunteers' headquarters issued the withdrawal statement on February 20 of this year, all comrades immediately responded enthusiastically to the call of the Volunteers' Party Committee to "not be arrogant, not be complacent, complete the task well, and maintain friendship forever" and to the requirements of "good departure, good arrival, good stay." First, a new high tide of helping the Korean people with production labor was launched throughout the army. From officers to soldiers, labor enthusiasm soared to an unprecedented level. They worked day and night, regardless of wind and rain, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, assisting the Korean people in various production labors. Their principle was to do whatever the local people needed, such as building irrigation canals, constructing dikes, digging wells, building houses, and constructing schools and public facilities. During labor, even sick comrades actively participated, and it was difficult to persuade them to rest. They said, "The opportunity is rare, we must crawl there." Some units could not stop working even after the shift. They said, "We represent the hearts of 600 million compatriots. To leave a little more friendship, we must work a little longer." Thus, the targets were broken one after another. In the face of successive withdrawals, decreasing personnel, and busy withdrawal work, they still completed the 1958 plan to help the Korean people with labor by 500%.

The broad masses of the Volunteers' officers and soldiers, by assisting the Korean people in restoration and construction, have shown the essence of the people's army, the principle of military-civilian unity under new conditions, and the concrete manifestation of internationalist consciousness. At the same time, through this action, the internationalist consciousness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers has been further enhanced.

An important political task during the withdrawal process was to hand over the defense well. While handing over the defense to the Korean People's Army, each unit strictly followed the handover regulations and handed over the barracks, equipment, and a large amount of materials and complete hospital facilities to our close comrades—the Korean People's Army without compensation. The soldiers unanimously said, "Korea is the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, and we should support it wholeheartedly," and also said, "We can sacrifice our blood and lives in Korea, so what can we not give up." Indeed, under the guidance of internationalist thought, they had nothing to give up. Whether it was the beloved broadcasting equipment of the broadcasters, the brand-new projectors of the projectionists, the fat chickens, ducks, geese, and pigs raised by the cooks, or anything else, nothing was handed over to the Korean People's Army in accordance with the handover regulations and relevant instructions of the superiors, complete and undamaged. Trenches, barracks, equipment, tables, chairs, and beds were always repaired and repainted. Beautifying the environment, repairing and arranging the clubhouse, the soldiers' meticulous care was beyond words. When the Korean People's Army's receiving units arrived, the leaders of our army at all levels led the troops to welcome them with drums and gongs, vacating the best rooms for the People's Army to live in, sending fine grains to the People's Army to eat, and giving their most beloved items, such as photos, badges, notebooks, and pens, to the People's Army comrades as souvenirs. The soldiers' quick-tongue poems said: "The People's Army and the Volunteers, one goal and one heart, two armies as one family, they are as close as brothers."

The Chinese People's Volunteers, from entering Korea to withdrawing from Korea, have consistently carried out the great will of the motherland and Chairman Mao's wise instructions for eight years, always holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and faithfully following the instructions to "cherish every mountain, river, grass, and tree in Korea." Therefore, for the broad masses of the Volunteers, they have not let down the glorious title of "the most beloved people" bestowed by the motherland.

The Korean people supported us with selfless spirit during the war
The Korean people cared for us without reserve after the war

The Chinese People's Volunteers, in the long struggle side by side with the Korean people, deeply felt that the unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples is based on proletarian internationalism. The deepening friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, the victories and achievements of the Volunteers in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the enhancement of the internationalist consciousness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers are inseparable from the care, support, guidance, and encouragement of the Korean people.

In the past domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan in China, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people had sacrificed their lives to support the struggle of the Chinese people. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression, the Korean people and the heroic People's Army, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and Premier Kim Il-sung, bravely fought the just war of resistance against American aggression, despite the destruction of their homeland and all difficulties, and fought against the most powerful imperialist aggressor army in the world. The Korean people paid a great price and made important contributions to win the war. This is not only an indispensable part of the struggle between the forces of peace and socialism and the forces of war and imperialism but also the greatest and most direct aid to our people. Now, the Korean people and the heroic People's Army stand on the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle in the East, continuing to defend the peace of the Far East, which is still the most direct support for us. The significance of this aid is immeasurable.

It should also be pointed out that in the struggle against American imperialist aggression, our close comrades—the heroic Korean People's Army—exerted tremendous power and made great contributions. This heroic army fought side by side with us, jointly defeating American imperialism. The two peoples' armies fought shoulder to shoulder, cooperated closely, supported each other, and jointly experienced hardships and defeats. In the post-war years, the two armies, based on the friendship of fighting side by side, further united and learned from each other, encouraging each other to jointly defend the fruits of victory and defend against possible enemy aggression. This internationalist fighting friendship will be as brilliant as the victory of the anti-aggression war, forever recorded in history.

During the war, although the Korean homeland suffered severe destruction by the American aggressor army, and the Korean people faced great difficulties, the Korean people endured all the disasters of war with a high spirit of self-sacrifice and fully supported us. When our army's food supply was not sufficient, they endured hunger and cold to send food to our hands. In the bitter cold of winter, they gave us their houses and warm kang beds to live in. To support our fighting, regardless of age or gender, they braved the wind and snow, risked their lives to rescue our wounded soldiers, braved enemy bombing, and worked day and night to repair bridges and roads, ensuring smooth transportation. According to very incomplete statistics, during the war, more than 300,000 people participated in carrying wounded soldiers and materials for the Volunteers. Among these people, there was the great internationalist warrior Pak Jaegeun, who sacrificed his life to protect our wounded soldiers; the support model Bang Hyeongbok, who risked his son's safety to rescue our wounded soldiers; Ham Jaebok, who opened an ice hole to wash 700 pieces of blood-stained clothing for the Volunteers; the famous Volunteer mothers and support models Gu Bujeok and Ryu Mae; the girl Seok Gihyeong, who was seriously injured while digging wild vegetables to support us; An Yulgi, who sent her seven-year-old son Kim Yeongsu to cut the ropes binding our captured reconnaissance soldier Li Jihwang while she herself perished with the enemy; and the Korean farmers who, during the Flying Tiger Mountain battle, braved the enemy's fierce artillery fire to deliver food to soldiers who had not eaten for two days, even after sacrificing more than 30 people, still insisted on climbing to the top of Flying Tiger Mountain and finally delivered the food to the soldiers' hands. These countless heroic deeds made us deeply feel that the Korean people were like our parents, brothers, and sisters. The Korean people's care and support for our army will be forever remembered.

The Korean people's hard work, bravery, indomitable fighting spirit, and lofty patriotism and internationalism deeply educated us. The broad masses of the Volunteers, in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, further understood the unshakable truth that proletarian internationalist unity is invincible.

During the war, the Korean people supported us with a selfless spirit in extremely difficult circumstances. After the war, in the process of healing the wounds of war, restoring the economy, and building socialism, until the last minute of our withdrawal from Korea, the Korean people, like treating their own brothers, cared for and supported us without reserve. Before the construction of the barracks, the Volunteer units mostly lived in Korean people's houses. Countless Korean mothers treated the Volunteer soldiers like their own children. In the morning, when the soldiers went out for training or labor, they would fill the soldiers' water bottles early; in the evening, when the soldiers returned, they would compete to mend the soldiers' clothes and dry their shoes and socks; at night, after the soldiers fell asleep, they would quietly enter the soldiers' rooms to check if the quilts were covered and if the kang was cold. It was truly "as close as family." Here, let me give two more examples: In late February 1956, heavy snow fell for several days in northern Korea, blocking two trains full of Volunteers with several meters of deep snow, making it impossible to move forward or backward, and the soldiers on the train were in great danger due to hunger and cold. Upon hearing the news, more than a thousand Korean people immediately rushed to rescue them. They braved all dangers, endured the heavy snow and wind, and delivered more than ten thousand jin of rice and a large amount of firewood and charcoal to the trains. The People's Army also sent planes to air-drop supplies. The two trains and all the people on them were finally rescued with the full support of the Korean military and civilians. Again, on January 13, 1958, Li Rongzhen, a platoon leader of the Volunteers stationed on Daewon Island, suffered from appendicitis, and the island had no way to treat him. His condition worsened, and he had to be quickly sent to the nearby island of Yeongdo for surgery to save his life. However, at that time, the sea was frozen, and shipping was suspended. When the responsible comrade of the Korean Workers' Party on the island heard the news, he immediately bid farewell to his family, braved the danger, and took four sailors to Daewon Island to rescue the critically ill soldier. During the round trip, they braved the seven-level storm waves and navigated through the ice floes, saving the life of the Volunteer soldier in extreme danger.

Over the past eight years, the Korean people's deep affection for the Volunteers is indescribable. The Korean female labor model Han Yujeong, after planting more than 600,000 trees with the Volunteer soldiers in Namyang-ri, wrote in Chinese to express her deep affection: "One tree, one heart, the roots of the trees are connected, the hearts of the Chinese and Korean peoples are connected, the evergreen pines and cypresses are eternal, the friendship between China and Korea is as deep as the sea."

The Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and the people have given high evaluations to the Chinese People's Volunteers' struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Over the past eight years, the Korean government has awarded hundreds of thousands of medals and badges to praise and encourage us. Premier Kim Il-sung and other party and government leaders personally visited the Volunteer units or construction sites to encourage us, and often sent the best art troupes and meritorious performers to perform for us. Over the past eight years, there have been more than ten million performances and film screenings. During festivals and holidays, large-scale delegations were organized to congratulate our army, bringing a large number of gifts and congratulatory letters. The number of visits reached 3,980 times, with 88,975 people, and 334,591 heartfelt congratulatory letters. Various kinds of gifts totaled 1,153,721 items, and 4,390 banners were presented. They often sent the freshest fruits and vegetables, pork, rice, and fresh fish to us, which contained such deep affection.

The Korean government and people have shown particular care for the graves of the Chinese People's Volunteers' martyrs who lie in Korean soil—the Martyrs' Cemetery. From the elderly to the children wearing red scarves, they regard taking care of the Martyrs' Cemetery of the Chinese People's Volunteers as their sacred internationalist mission. They plant fresh flowers in spring, remove weeds in summer, sweep fallen leaves in autumn, and shovel snow in winter. They offer wreaths every season and hold memorial ceremonies during festivals and holidays. They have made each Martyrs' Cemetery as beautiful as a park and regard it as a place to educate their descendants about internationalism. An old man who guards the Martyrs' Cemetery said to us when we parted, "Please convey to the parents, brothers, wives, and children of the martyrs that as long as there are Korean people, we will definitely take good care of the martyrs' graves." For this, not only we and the families of the martyrs will be grateful, but even the martyrs who lie in Korean soil will smile in their graves.

The Korean people have been caring for and loving the Chinese People's Volunteers without reserve for eight years, and after the start of our withdrawal, it has become a nationwide high tide. To see us off, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a special decision. The party and state leaders, led by Premier Kim Il-sung, personally came to see off the returning troops. They made tens of thousands of Korea-China friendship commemorative badges to give to us as souvenirs. They mobilized the entire nation to sign and write letters in the name of the entire nation to praise and thank us and the Chinese people. This letter and tens of thousands of congratulatory letters are filled with the true feelings of the peoples of the two countries. We named the dams, dikes, and schools we helped build with the best names in various places in Korea. The Korean government helped us in every way to carry out the withdrawal task, dispatching the best train drivers and a large number of trains to transport the troops, and the people in various places voluntarily repaired bridges and roads to facilitate the passage of military vehicles. They invited our military officers to visit the most beautiful scenic spots, tour, and recuperate. The Korean people competed to give us their most meaningful and precious gifts, including ancestral swords passed down for generations, wartime souvenirs, soil from the battlefield in cloth bags, red scarves worn by schoolchildren, embroidered pillows made by girls, and earrings and rings worn by old women at their weddings. Each item fully expressed the Korean people's love for us. When the troops departed, the local residents were dressed in their finest to see us off. From the capital Pyongyang to the county seats of various provinces, from the boarding stations to every stop along the way, whenever the troops passed, there were grand gatherings, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people. These farewell and parting scenes were extremely moving. Every gathering was colorful, with flags waving, singing and dancing, drums and gongs, tears in eyes, and reluctance to part. From generals to soldiers, from children wearing red scarves to elderly people with white hair, they all hugged each other tightly, cherishing this most precious moment. Sometimes, even experienced photographers could not take pictures because they were overwhelmed by emotion. The Korean people's deep affection will forever be in our memory. For this, we not only have the responsibility to report to the people of our motherland but also will repay the Korean people with actual actions. A soldier once said to a Korean mother who came to see us off, "If American imperialism dares to launch another war against the Korean people, as long as the Korean mother calls, we will cross the Yalu River again to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea." This represents the hearts of all soldiers.

The scenes that emerged during the withdrawal are indescribable, proving the consolidation and development of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, and a grand review of the power of Korea-China friendship and the unity of the peoples of the two countries. This is a great friendship, a friendship based on proletarian internationalist thought, a friendship forged in blood, and a friendship that has withstood severe tests. "The friendship between Korea and China is higher than the sky, and the friendship between Korea and China is deeper than the sea," this is the common language written in different scripts. From this, it can be seen that the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries is not only extremely precious but also has great vitality. It will forever be a powerful guarantee for the peoples of the two countries to defeat their common enemies, benefit the two countries' peoples to march forward together on the socialist road, and strengthen the power of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

We have gloriously completed the historical mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea
We will immediately stand at the posts most needed by the motherland

In summary, the Chinese People's Volunteers, after eight years abroad, have gloriously completed the historical mission of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea entrusted by the people of the motherland. In the largest modern war after World War II, we defeated the enemy and won victory, and also gained rich experience in modern warfare. Over the past eight years, the broad masses of the Volunteers have fulfilled their duties for the motherland, for the people, for Sino-Korean friendship, and for the peace of the Far East and the world. The martyrs who sacrificed their lives for this and their heroic deeds will be forever remembered in history!

The great victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea is the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the result of the full support of the people of the motherland.

As early as the initial victory of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao taught us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their power in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." When American imperialism launched the war of aggression in Korea, Chairman Mao again called on us: "The people of the world should unite and make full preparations to defeat any provocation by American imperialism." Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire country not only had full spiritual preparation but also carried out a series of preparations for anti-aggression wars. When American imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and people, ordered their invading army to approach the Chinese border, at this crucial moment that decided the fate of the Chinese people, the Party and Chairman Mao correctly analyzed the international and domestic situation at that time, predicted the complex situation of the war process, grasped the conditions for victory, and resolutely led the people of the entire country to launch the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Thus, the Volunteers were quickly organized, holding high the banner of "resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defend the motherland," crossing the Yalu River, and fighting against the fully equipped American aggressors with inferior equipment. The victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea not only proved Chairman Mao's wise judgment that "American imperialism is just a paper tiger with a strong exterior but a weak interior" but also proved that Chairman Mao's theory of guiding war is an invincible theory. The great victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the victory of the Party and Chairman Mao's wise decision-making and the victory of Chairman Mao's thought.

In the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the 650 million people of our country, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, on the one hand, carried out extensive economic recovery work and socialist construction, and on the other hand, launched a great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea nationwide, directly supporting the Volunteers. The full support of the people of the motherland enabled us to receive an uninterrupted supply of materials and a surge of spiritual encouragement. We still remember that the working-class brothers had put forward the slogan: "The factory is the battlefield, and the machine is the gun"; the peasant brothers had guaranteed: "If you need people, we have people; if you need grain, we have grain"; the nationwide movement to donate planes enabled us to quickly improve our equipment; large-scale work to care for the families of martyrs and soldiers boosted the morale of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, and the visits and performances of delegation and art troupes enriched the spiritual life of the frontline soldiers. Over the past eight years, the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the great efforts and full support of the people of the motherland have been the decisive guarantee for the great victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. All comrades of the Volunteers will always remember: the glory belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao, and the glory belongs to the people of the motherland.

We have been away from the motherland for only eight years, but our great motherland has become incomparably stronger than it was eight years ago. The political awareness of the people of the entire country has reached an unprecedented height. The 650 million people are advancing under the brilliant guidance of the general line for building socialism with "great leaps forward, more, faster, better, and more economical efforts," with the heroic spirit of "one day equals twenty years," with boundless strength and wisdom, accelerating the socialist construction of our country. Whether in industry, agriculture, science, or culture, miracles are emerging everywhere. Since this year's wheat harvest, a batch of high-yield "satellites" have been launched on the agricultural front, and steel production this year will double, and the development of the national economy is like a rocket soaring into the sky. This is an unprecedented high speed in history. We, the children of the motherland abroad, are always excited and inspired by the great achievements of the socialist construction of the motherland. Now that we have returned to the motherland, our primary task is to learn from the people of the motherland, immediately stand at the most needed posts, and with the spirit of the great leap forward of the people of the motherland and boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, directly contribute all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

At present, American imperialism is still occupying Chinese territory in Taiwan, and the task of completely liberating the territory of the motherland has not been completed. The liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu is the business of the Chinese people themselves, and we will not allow the Americans to interfere. The conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is unacceptable to the 600 million Chinese people. We hope that our compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will respond to the call of the motherland, unite as one, and oppose American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs. The Chinese people will definitely drive American imperialism out of Taiwan, and Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will definitely return to the embrace of the motherland. All comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have returned to the motherland are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and contribute all our strength to the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

Let us unite with the people of the entire country to strive together to quickly build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Long live the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea!
Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Korea!
Long live our great motherland and people!
Long live the helmsman of our cause, the Communist Party of China!
Long live our great leader, Chairman Mao!

    中国人民志愿军八年来抗美援朝工作报告
    一九五八年十月三十日在全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会扩大的联席会议上
    中国人民志愿军司令员　　杨勇主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    祖国人民所派遣的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，在朝鲜坚持八年抗美援朝持久斗争以后，现在已经全部返回祖国了。中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，标志着祖国人民给予志愿军抗美援朝这一伟大的历史任务已经胜利地完成了。我现在代表中国人民志愿军，就八年来抗美援朝的工作，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会，并且向祖国人民作一次简略的汇报。一
    一九五○年六月二十五日，美帝国主义唆使它的走狗李承晚集团，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了蓄谋已久的进攻。不久以后，美帝国主义者就纠集了它自己的和另外十五个仆从国家的军队，打着“联合国”旗号，一起投入这场罪恶的侵略战争，妄图一举而消灭朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且把战争扩大到中国，把战火燃烧到全世界。美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，派兵侵占了我国的领土台湾，就是最有力的铁证。
    中国人民是热爱和平的。朝鲜战争爆发后，我国政府就一再主张和平解决朝鲜问题，要求美国武装力量退出台湾，迅速停止侵朝战争。我们国家需要在和平的环境下恢复遭到长期战争破坏的国民经济，发展工农业生产和文化教育以及其他各项建设事业。但是，站起来了的中国人民，在中国共产党和我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导下，从来也不害怕帝国主义强加在我们头上的侵略战争。早在朝鲜战争之初，毛主席就号召我们“团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”一九五○年九月美国侵略者在朝鲜西海岸仁川登陆以后，疯狂达于极点。一九五○年九月三十日，周恩来总理严正地警告美国侵略者说：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”但是，美帝国主义者把中国人民的和平愿望看成是软弱可欺的表现，对我国政府的严正警告置若罔闻，大举越过三八线，进逼我国边境，并且派遣侵朝空军放肆地侵入我国东北领空，炸我城乡，杀我同胞，毁我财产，从而把侵略战争的矛头直接指向我国东北。我国的安全遭到严重的威胁。中国人民在这忍无可忍的情况下，为了支援唇齿相依的邻邦，为了保家卫国，这才组成志愿军，高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的正义旗帜，跨过鸭绿江，配合朝鲜人民军抗击狂暴的美国侵略者。
    美帝国主义为了掩饰自己的侵略罪行，竟然颠倒黑白，诬蔑中国人民志愿军“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的正义行动是对朝鲜的侵略。联合国在美国的操纵下，可耻地诬蔑我国在朝鲜进行侵略。这种诬蔑已经被中国人民志愿军在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中所获得的胜利彻底粉碎了。
    中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一起，经过三年苦战，在当时极端困难的物质条件下，以无比的英勇顽强和惊人的刻苦精神，打退了美国侵略者和他的帮凶军队。三年战争，朝中人民军队共同歼灭敌人一百零九万，其中包括美军三十九万；击落击伤敌机一万二千多架；击毁和缴获坦克三千多辆。打着联合国旗号的美国侵略者，在遭到惨败以后才不得不在停战协定上签了字。
    朝鲜战争以事实证明：爱好和平的人民，要想得到和平，只有同帝国主义侵略者进行坚决的斗争，而战争狂人在没有获得应有的教训的时候，是不会轻易罢手的。诚如我国各民主党派一九五○年十一月四日发表的、举世闻名的联合宣言所说：“世界上爱好和平的人民如果想要得到和平，就必须用积极的行动来抵抗暴行，制止侵略。只有抵抗，才有可能使帝国主义者获得教训，才有可能按照人民的意志公正地解决朝鲜及其他地区的独立和解放的问题。”
    中朝两国人民军队发挥战斗威力
    使美国遭受“陆军史上最大的失败”
    现在，我们不妨简单的回顾一下朝鲜战争的历史。
    朝鲜战争之初，我们的敌人是何等猖獗，何等狂妄。美帝国主义的走狗李承晚叫嚣“三天完成北伐”，侵朝美军总司令麦克阿瑟妄称要在感恩节前结束朝鲜战争。当美国侵略军进逼鸭绿江边的时候，他们得意洋洋地发出了这样荒谬绝伦的狂言：“在历史上，鸭绿江并不是把中朝两国截然划分的不可逾越的障碍”。但是，事实却粉碎了他们的妄想。美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，一开始就遭到了为保卫自己祖国的独立和自由的英勇的朝鲜人民的坚决抵抗。中国人民志愿军突然出现在朝鲜战场上以后，连续给美国侵略者以沉重打击，使其屡战屡败，迅速地改变了敌我力量的对比和战局的发展。中国人民志愿军从一九五○年十月二十五日入朝参战，到一九五一年五月下旬，在半年多一点的时间里，同朝鲜人民军一起进行了五次攻势战役，五战五捷，取得了歼敌二十二万余人的伟大胜利。这样就把美国侵略军和他的十五个仆从国家的军队，连同李承晚集团一起，从鸭绿江边打回到他们原来发动侵略战争的地方——三八线附近。在这以后，美国侵略军虽然妄图拼命挣扎，但是随着时间的推移，随着加在他们头上的日益沉重的打击，他们的打算落空了，幻想破灭了。他们所议论的已经不再是什么时候能够胜利的问题，而是不得不承认此次侵朝战争是“美国陆军史上最大的失败”，是“美国从未遭到的最完全的失败”。
    已经看不到胜利希望的美国侵略者，在越战越强的朝中两国人民军队的惨重打击下，在全世界爱好和平的人民日益强烈的舆论压力下，才不得不违背他自己扩大侵略战争的意旨，被迫接受苏联政府的和平倡议，同意举行停战谈判。一九五一年七月十日停战谈判在朝鲜的古都开城开始举行。从此，开始了一场尖锐、复杂的军事与外交互相结合和彼此影响的斗争。美帝国主义者对于被迫接受和平并不甘心。他们在谈判中既不肯承认自己军事上的失败，又不愿意以平等协商的精神公平合理地解决朝鲜问题。他们以所谓“海、空军优势的补偿”的荒谬借口，妄图在会议桌上得到他们在战场上得不到的东西。当他们的讹诈政策和无理要求遭到朝中方面严词拒绝后，竟然提出：“让炸弹、大炮和机关枪去辩论吧！”很显然，美国侵略者企图以停战谈判掩护军事进攻，又以军事压力迫使我们屈服。
    中国人民是要和平的。我们一贯主张在公平合理的基础上达成和平解决朝鲜问题的协议。但是，美国侵略者如果不放弃他那种蛮横无理的要求和扩大侵略的阴谋，而坚持要打下去的话，我们就只有遵循毛主席的教导，同朝鲜人民一起，一直战斗下去。毛主席说：“美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”
    一九五一年八月中旬，正当停战谈判刚刚进行了一个月的时候，美国侵略军就发动了夏季攻势；在夏季攻势以后，又发动了秋季攻势。但是，美国侵略者就像俗话所说的，“搬起石头砸了自己的脚”，非但没有压服朝中人民，反而徒然招致了更加悲惨的失败。朝中人民军队在这一段时间里，在横贯朝鲜二百五十公里的战线上，构筑了铜墙铁壁般的防御阵地——地下长城，在持久作战、积极防御的作战方针指导下，以顽强的阵地防御战挡住了美国侵略军的进攻，把战线稳定在三八线附近。同时，又乘敌疲惫积极地组织了连续的反击，狠狠地打击和歼灭敌人。在一九五一年秋冬两季作战中，朝中人民军队共歼灭敌人二十五万，超过了五次战役歼敌数字的总和，敌人爬行二公里至九公里，损兵折将二十五万，这就是“炸弹、大炮和机关枪辩论”的结论。
    美国侵略者是“不见棺材不落泪”的，当他们在地面的攻势遭到惨败后，又凭借所谓“空中优势”发动了目的在于摧毁我军后方和运输补给线的所谓绞杀战。他们以成千上万架的飞机，成千上万吨的炸弹，日夜不停地对我军后方的一切设施和铁路、公路、桥梁滥施轰炸。敌人的“绞杀战”对我们的破坏是严重的。但是，我们在祖国人民和朝鲜人民的全力支援下，依靠广大指战员，特别是铁道兵、工程兵、后勤部队、公安部队、成千上万的英雄司机和防空部队，依靠他们无比的英勇、无穷的智慧，组成了一条炸不烂、打不垮的钢铁运输线，战胜了一切困难，巩固了后方，保证了前线的供应。这样，敌人煞费苦心的“绞杀战”也被彻底粉碎了。对于这一点，连当时的美军第八军军长范弗里特也不得不招认：“虽然联军的空军和海军尽了一切力量，企图阻断共产党的供应，然而共产党仍然以令人难以置信的顽强毅力把物资运到前线，创造了惊人的奇迹”。
    一九五二年一月初，美国侵略军违背人道，破坏国际公约，在朝鲜北半部和我国东北，使用了灭绝人性的细菌武器，妄图通过各种毒性病菌摧毁我方人、畜和农作物，从根本上枯竭朝中人民的抵抗能力，但是，带毒菌的苍蝇、蚊子、甲虫、老鼠也救不了注定要失败的美国侵略者。我们在祖国人民派到朝鲜的专家帮助下，集中了广大群众的智慧，掀起了轰轰烈烈的防疫卫生运动，采用各种方法，击败了美国侵略者的阴谋，保证了军民的健康。同时，在祖国也开展了规模巨大的爱国卫生运动。细菌战也终于被我们彻底地粉碎了。美帝国主义者发动细菌战，除了在政治上和道义上招致惨重的失败，把“细菌战犯”、“细菌将军”的头衔紧紧地扣在自己的头上以外，别的什么东西也没有得到。
    到此为止，美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上除了未使用原子武器以外，什么本事都拿出来了，一九五二年十月八日美国方面又一次片面地宣布中止停战谈判。就在一个星期以后，十月十四日，美国侵略军开始了大规模的进攻。敌人这次进攻的目的是首先夺取上甘岭，尔后夺取五圣山，企图在我军防线上突破一个缺口，进而分割我防御体系，迫使我军后退，以便给自己造成在谈判中的有利地位。上甘岭战斗表示，敌人企图在绝望中挣扎，在我军只有两个连据守不到三点七平方公里的阵地上，敌人先后投入了四个师六万人以上的兵力，动用了十八个炮兵营，出动了三千多架次的飞机和一百七十八辆坦克。在持续四十三天的战斗中，敌人发动了九百多次冲击，发射了一百九十万发炮弹和重磅炸弹。这是世界战争史上所没有过的最密集的炮火。山头被削低了两公尺，岩石被炸成了一公尺多厚的粉末。战斗空前激烈而残酷。但是，由于祖国全民性的捐献运动所加强了的中国人民志愿军，在强大炮火支援下，依托着以坑道为骨干的阵地，在防御作战中运用了两年来积累起来的丰富经验，发挥了高度的革命英雄主义精神。经过反复争夺，举世闻名的上甘岭战斗终于以我们的胜利和敌人的惨败而告终。
    为了迫使美国侵略者接受停战，为了打击扣留我方战俘、破坏遣俘协议的美国侵略者和狂妄叫嚣要“单独干”的李承晚集团，从一九五三年五月中旬开始，我军在朝鲜人民军的密切配合下发动了强大的夏季攻势。在两个半月的作战过程中，在宽达二十公里的正面上，进行了一百三十三次进攻，收复了二百四十平方公里的土地，歼敌十二万多人。
    美国侵略者和李承晚集团，只是在朝中人民军队强大攻击的严重打击下，才无可奈何地在停战协定上签了字。当时的所谓联合国军总司令克拉克自己也不得不伤心地说：“我是美国第一个在没有取得胜利的停战协议上签字的将军”。
    就是这样，美帝国主义在第二次世界大战之后发动的一次规模最大的最残暴的侵略战争，被朝中人民打败了。它伸出来的魔爪被斩断了，点燃的战火被扑灭了，破坏和平的暴行被制止了。它自我吹嘘的“实力政策”破产了，纸老虎的真像被戳穿了，不可战胜的神话破灭了。
    朝中人民以铁的事实向全世界庄严地宣告：帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上惨败的史实
    对我们对朋友对敌人都有深长的意义
    自以为“举世无敌”的美帝国主义何以被它认为并不强大的中朝人民打败了呢？论经济，美国是资本主义世界最大的工业强国，如果拿对于战争有着重大意义的钢铁生产来说，当时美国的产量百倍于我。美国在侵朝战争期间直接战费的支出就在二百亿美元以上，运往朝鲜的作战物资就有七千三百万吨。可以断言，再多些美国也可以花得起。论兵力，它不仅以自己陆军的三分之一，空军的五分之一，海军的大部作为侵朝战争的主力，而且拼凑了十五个仆从国家的兵力集中到朝鲜战场上来。论军事装备，敌我双方优劣悬殊。美帝国主义几乎除了原子弹以外的一切新式武器都使用上了，并且始终具有“海、空优势”。而中国人民志愿军，在战争开始时，没有一架飞机参与前线作战，仅有数量很少的大炮，只是在后来，在祖国人民发起抗美援朝捐献运动以后，才组成了自己的空军，加强了自己的炮火，但是，仍然没有从根本上改变敌优我劣的条件。论指挥，美国虽曾三易其帅，但是，不论因吃败仗而被撤职的麦克阿瑟、细菌将军李奇微、还是屡战屡败最后不得不在停战协定上签字的克拉克，既不是“没有战争经验”的将军，也不能简单地评为“指挥无能”。参加侵朝战争的“联合国军”在他们的指挥下，曾经使用了闪电式的攻击战、乘虚而入的仁川登陆战、瘫痪我交通运输线的“绞杀战”、灭绝人性的细菌战以及各种名堂的攻势和战法。这些作战手段不为不毒。然而，在朝中两国人民军队面前，仍然无能为力。总之，就经济力量、军事力量和技术装备条件而论，优势显然并没有在我们手中。那么，朝鲜战争的结局为什么恰好同美帝国主义的预料相反，以中朝人民的胜利、以美帝国主义的惨败而告终呢？为什么在这些方面居于劣势的一方打败了居于优势的一方呢？这是帝国主义所无法理解的。
    朝鲜战场上以敌优我劣的装备条件而获得我胜敌败的结局，决不是由于什么偶然的原因所产生的偶然结果。这是和平力量同战争力量、社会主义力量同帝国主义力量在斗争中决定胜败的必然因素充分发挥作用而产生的必然结果。决定战争胜败的是“战争性质”和“人心向背”。人民的力量是不可战胜的。在这个决定的因素方面，全部优势却完全集中在我们手中。我们在战斗中得到了伟大祖国人民的全力支持。祖国人民在兵员、武器、装备和供应方面，都尽最大的努力满足了我们的需要，并且在精神上给了我们极大的关怀和鼓舞。在同英勇的朝鲜人民军并肩的战斗中，我们得到了兄弟的朝鲜人民的极大支持，我们得到了朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府的亲切关怀，我们用鲜血同朝鲜人民结成了亲密的友谊。我们在斗争中得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民的积极支持，得到了全世界爱好和平的人民的声援。这些支持和援助，一直鼓舞着我们进行战斗。这些就是我们在战争中终于打败敌人的关键所在。
    当然，还应该指出，我必胜、敌必败的结局，是上述这些客观存在的条件，和直接参加战争的人的主观努力结合起来、充分发挥了作用的结果。我们丝毫也不否认在朝鲜战争中，由于敌人的残暴，和敌人在军事装备上的优势所加于我们的困难。但是，由爱国主义和国际主义思想武装起来的中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一起，在战斗中表现了坚韧不拔的毅力、战胜一切敌人的英雄气概，和克服一切困难的高贵品质。我军各级指挥员以毛主席的军事思想武装了自己，正确地运用了我国人民在同内外敌人长期斗争中所积累起来的丰富的作战经验，根据朝鲜战争所具有的特点，灵活地运用了人民战争和人民军队的战略战术。在战争的进程中，全体指战员以巨大努力充分发挥和加强了我军的优点，利用和扩大了敌人的缺点。这样，朝鲜战争就不能不以我们的胜利和敌人的惨败为其必然的结局。
    发动侵略战争的美帝国主义被刚刚解放了的中朝两国人民打得惨败的史实，无论对我们自己、对我们的朋友、还是对我们的敌人，都是意味深长的而又有着教育意义的。我们和我们的朋友重温这段历史，可以获得鼓舞。因为朝鲜战争的结局生动地告诉我们：全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，只要进行坚决的斗争，帝国主义侵略者必将像他们在朝鲜的命运一样，遭到可耻的失败。与全世界爱好和平、争取民族独立的人民为敌的帝国主义者，在他们举起屠刀之前，不管他们愿不愿意，总得要温习一下他们在侵朝战争中所得到的历史教训。
    从朝鲜停战到现在，只不过是五年的时间，然而，国内和国际形势已经发生了极其深刻的变化。我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设，正以巨人的步伐，以“一天等于二十年”的速度飞跃发展。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，已经空前地团结和壮大起来。亚非地区和拉丁美洲各国人民反殖民主义的斗争和民族独立运动，已经形成不可抗拒的潮流。我们深深地感到，世界形势已经进到了毛主席所论断的东风已经压倒西风的时代。五年以前，我们既然能够在敌我经济力量和军事装备极端悬殊的条件下战胜美帝国主义，那么，在情况已经发生根本改变的今天，我们凭借朝鲜战争的实践体验，坚信毛主席和赫鲁晓夫同志在会谈公报中所说：“如果帝国主义战争狂人竟敢把战争强加在世界人民的头上，那么，所有爱好和平、爱好自由的国家和人民必将紧密地团结在一起，彻底消灭帝国主义侵略者，奠定世界的永久和平。”
    二
    在朝鲜战场上把美国侵略者打回到他们原来发动战争的地方，迫使他们接受停战，这是朝中两国人民的伟大胜利，也是全世界一切爱好和平的人民的共同胜利。朝鲜停战，正如金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员发布的停战命令中所说：“停战协定的签定是以和平方式解决朝鲜问题的第一步，因而是有利于远东及世界和平的。它获得了朝中两国人民的热烈拥护，使全世界爱好和平人民受到了莫大的鼓舞。”但是，要使停战协定的全部条款得到切实的遵守和执行，绝不是没有阻碍的。
    同美李破坏停战协定的行为进行斗争
    保持警惕粉碎了敌人挑起战争的阴谋
    美国代表虽然在朝鲜停战协定上签了字，但是，美国华尔街垄断资本家为了从保持紧张局势和扩军备战中攫取高额利润，从停战协定签字的那天起，就一贯利用种种卑劣的手段，竭力破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。因此，停战以来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民就不能不同美帝国主义继续进行斗争。这是维护朝鲜停战同破坏朝鲜停战之争，是争取朝鲜问题和平解决同阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决之争。这场斗争是尖锐的，是长期的，是关系着远东和世界和平的。
    停战协定签字的前夕，美国的一些好战分子就曾经支持南朝鲜的李承晚大肆叫嚣反对停战。李承晚——这个美国金鱼缸里的“勇夫”，公然威胁要“单独干下去”，要“采取片面政策”，要“武力统一朝鲜”。李承晚假借“就地释放”为名，制造强迫扣留我方战俘的事件，妄图以这种流氓手段阻挡达成停战协定的道路。只是由于朝中两国人民采取和平解决朝鲜问题的坚定政策，并且给予坚决的打击，李承晚集团的阴谋才未能得逞。
    停战协定的墨迹未干，杜勒斯就同李承晚签定了“美、韩共同防御条约”，规定美国军队有权无限期驻留朝鲜南部。实际上就是企图抵制停战协定，借此赖在朝鲜南部不走。接着，李承晚集团以世间罕见的野兽般的残暴手段阻挠朝中被俘人员行使遣返权利，破坏了战俘问题的协议，他又破坏了关于政治会议的双方会谈，使停战协定中明文规定的政治会议开不成。总之，他是千方百计地破坏朝鲜停战中关于导致和平解决朝鲜问题的一切规定，企图使朝鲜永远陷于分裂状态。他不断地阻挠和破坏中立国视察小组的工作，对视察小组的人员进行侮辱和威胁。为了逃避对他破坏停战协定的行为进行视察，美方竟于一九五六年五月三十一日片面地宣布并强迫中立国监察委员会的视察小组撤出朝鲜南部。他不断在非军事区进行挑衅，制造违反停战协定事件。他违反停战协定，经常把各种武器非法运入朝鲜南部，加强美军和李承晚伪军的装备。去年下半年，美帝国主义已把它驻朝鲜南部的两个师改编为原子师，并且把李承晚伪军由十六个师扩大到二十一个师。一九五七年六月美方竟片面宣布废除朝鲜停战协定十三款卯项，随即把F—100喷气式飞机、280公厘口径的原子大炮和“诚实约翰”火箭等新式武器运入朝鲜南部。这些事实说明，美帝国主义公然不顾停战协定正在把朝鲜南部变为它的原子战争基地。
    停战以来，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军一起，一方面严格地遵守停战协定的一切规定，同时对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的一切破坏停战协定的行为进行了坚决的斗争。
    和平解决朝鲜问题是朝中人民的一贯主张，然而，对于侵略成性、惯于背信弃义的美帝国主义必须保持高度警惕。因此，我们在停战后，志愿军全体指战员树立了牢固的“坚持抗美援朝持久斗争”的思想，警惕地守卫在社会主义阵营的东方最前哨——三八线阵地上，警惕地保卫着远东的和平。我们严密地监视着敌人，随时保持战斗准备。在长年累月中，志愿军的战士们不顾冬日的风雪严寒，不顾夏天的日晒雨淋，不分白昼夜晚，爬山越岭，巡逻放哨。几年来，由于中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军始终保持着高度警惕，随时严阵以待，敌人虽然进行了一系列的挑衅活动，但都被我们一一揭露和击破，从而保持了停战局势的相对稳定性。从一九五三年七月二十七日停战协定签字至一九五八年七月二十七日，在这五年的时间内，美李军违反停战协定的事件即达七百九十二起，在同一时期内，我方捕获敌人通过非军事区和海面派遣的特务就有七百人之多。军事停战委员会和中立国视察小组曾经对美国和李承晚的违反停战协定的行为进行过多次调查，美方代表每次在铁的人证物证面前狼狈不堪。所有这些，不仅适时地揭穿了敌人的阴谋活动，粉碎了他重新挑起战争的狂妄企图，并且迫使美帝国主义在全世界人民面前不得不实际上承认自己的违犯停战协定的罪行，使其在道义上遭到失败。当美李军违犯停战协定的罪行被揭露以后，美方代表也曾经用流氓手段，凭空捏造所谓我方“违反协定”事件，只是因为他拿不出任何证据，徒然给自己在真理和道义面前加倍丢脸。由于朝中方面在停战以来始终严格地遵守和执行了停战协定的各项条款，正义始终紧紧地掌握在我们的手里，这就是我们打击敌人破坏停战协定的有力武器。因此，我们始终都处于主动和有利的地位。
    志愿军撤军说明和平力量胜过战争力量
      敌人胆敢发动新的冒险必遭粉碎性打击
    不仅如此，朝中方面为了和平解决朝鲜问题，还主动采取了一系列的重要措施。一九五三年美帝国主义拒绝召开停战协定所规定的政治会议以后，朝中两国政府就一再建议，举行有关国家会议，协商从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经向南朝鲜当局提出将南北朝鲜的兵力各裁减到十万或十万人以下的建议。当南朝鲜当局拒绝以后，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五六年单方面采取了裁减兵力八万人的行动。中国人民志愿军为了表示我们对和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，为了进一步和缓远东的紧张局势，在一九五四年到一九五五年一年当中曾经先后主动从朝鲜撤出十九个师。朝鲜政府曾经多次为南、北朝鲜的通商、人民的自由往来、通讯和文化交流提出了合理的建议，但是，朝中方面所有这些完全符合朝鲜人民利益的建议，都一概遭到美帝国主义和李承晚集团的无理拒绝。在美国的这种作法之下朝鲜南部人民继续处于水深火热之中，整个朝鲜人民继续遭受分裂的痛苦，而且朝鲜问题长期不得解决，紧张局势没有消除，远东和世界和平继续受到威胁。
    朝鲜问题的解决应该是朝鲜人民在不受外来干涉的条件下，自己解决自己的问题。一切外国军队撤出朝鲜是实现朝鲜和平统一的先决条件。一九五八年二月五日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府就朝鲜的和平统一问题发表声明，声明中建议：一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。二月七日，我国政府声明完全支持朝鲜政府的这个重大和平倡议。随后，以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团，在访问朝鲜期间同以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府代表团进行了会谈，在一九五八年二月十九日发表了关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的联合声明。中国人民志愿军总部在一九五八年二月二十日发表了关于一九五八年全部撤出朝鲜的声明。我们在声明中说：“中国人民志愿军全体官兵完全赞同我国政府的建议，决定于一九五八年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜”。现在，中国人民志愿军已经忠实地执行了自己的诺言，全部撤出了朝鲜。
    中国人民志愿军全部从朝鲜撤出的实际行动，有力地证明朝中两国政府和人民和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。这一措施获得了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的广泛赞扬和拥护，并且大大地鼓舞了他们维护和平、反对战争的斗争。
    现在摆在美帝国主义面前的问题是：顺应全世界的和平要求，尊重朝鲜人民和平统一自己祖国的愿望，把军队从朝鲜撤出呢？还是继续占领朝鲜南部使朝鲜人民继续遭受分裂的痛苦呢？由于我们撤出朝鲜，世界舆论将迫使美帝国主义者从中加以选择。如果美帝国主义者顽固地拒绝从朝鲜南部撤出它的侵略军队，那么，它就将永远摆脱不掉阻挠朝鲜和平统一的罪责。
    在美国侵略军仍然侵占朝鲜南部的情况下，中国人民志愿军毅然全部撤出朝鲜这一主动措施，是和平力量胜过战争力量，社会主义力量胜过帝国主义力量的形势所决定的；是朝中人民对于自己的力量，对于维护和平事业具有充分信心的表现。
    三年的朝鲜战争早已证明，为反抗侵略，保家卫国和捍卫和平而英勇战斗的朝中人民是不可战胜的。如果美国侵略者和李承晚集团竟把朝中人民促进和平的伟大行动看作是软弱的表现，以为有机可乘，敢于冒天下之大不韪，发动新的冒险行动，那么他们就会再一次犯极大的错误，并且必定遭到朝中人民粉碎性的还击。
    只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要
      中国人民优秀儿女将再跨过鸭绿江
    朝鲜人民力量的日益强大是维护朝鲜和平、争取朝鲜和平统一的基本保证。朝鲜美丽的山河虽然遭到美帝国主义的严重破坏，但是，我们亲眼看到：朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相的正确领导下，在苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的援助下，他们以勤劳的双手和无比顽强的精神，克服了种种困难，医治了战争的创伤，重建了和平生活。朝鲜人民早在一九五六年就已经完成了战后三年经济恢复计划；使工、农业产量恢复和超过了战前的水平。从一九五七年起，朝鲜人民根据朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会所规定的基本方向，开始执行第一个五年计划。朝鲜人民的经济建设就进入了一个新的阶段。现在，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国无论在政治、经济和文化等建设方面，都有了巨大的成就，他们已经创建了自己的重工业和轻工业基地，完成了农业合作化。朝鲜工业总产值，今年将增长到一九四八年的四点七倍左右，谷物生产今年将增加一百万吨。随着经济的发展，教育、科学和文教等事业也有了巨大的发展。跨上了千里马的全体劳动者，正在以冲天的干劲，沿着社会主义的康庄大道飞跃前进。朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就，加上经过战争的锻炼具有优良的军事素质和政治素质的英雄的朝鲜人民军队的强大力量，就是维护朝鲜和平、争取朝鲜和平统一的决定性的保障。现在，朝鲜北半部空前巩固，成为铜墙铁壁；它将更加鼓舞和推动朝鲜南半部人民反对美李统治的斗争。
    无论过去和将来，朝鲜人民的斗争都不是孤立的。他们统一祖国、反抗侵略、保卫和平的正义事业，有着强大的中国人民的支持，有着强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的支持，有着亚非地区和拉丁美洲日益高涨的反殖民主义斗争的配合，有着全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，他们是不可战胜的，他们的正义事业是一定能够胜利的。
    中国人民志愿军虽然撤出朝鲜，但是，我国人民仍然继续关怀着我们两国反抗侵略、保卫和平和建设社会主义的共同事业。中国人民将始终同兄弟的朝鲜人民站在一起，中国人民志愿军总部的声明已经向全世界人民庄严地宣告：“如果美帝国主义和它的追随者胆敢破坏朝鲜停战协定的尊严，再一次发动侵朝战争，那时只要朝鲜人民和朝鲜政府认为需要，中国人民将会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再一次跨过鸭绿江来，同朝鲜人民军一起为粉碎敌人的侵犯而共同战斗。朝中两国人民既然能在几年前打退美帝国主义的疯狂进攻，那末，当今天中朝两国人民的力量更加强大，而国际形势已经是东风压倒西风的时候，我们就更有把握使重新发动战争的侵略者遭到比上次更加惨重的失败。”三
    在伟大的反抗美国侵略的斗争中，中朝两国人民的传统友谊，得到了进一步加强和发展。在中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民和人民军并肩作战的日子里，我们同甘苦，共患难，密切配合，互相支援。中朝两国战士的鲜血流在一起，共同赢得胜利。停战实现后，我们又为维护停战协定争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，保卫远东和世界和平而同美帝国主义进行了坚决的斗争。同时，我们还积极参加了朝鲜人民的经济恢复和社会主义建设的劳动。朝鲜人民则始终以无比的热情和崇高的国际主义精神，关怀和全力支援我们。八年相处，情同骨肉，这是我们每一个人的深刻体会。
    中国人民志愿军是以高度的爱国主义和国际主义相结合的思想武装起来的。这是党和毛主席教导的结果，是中国人民在长期革命斗争中所形成的，同时也是我们敌人野兽般的残暴行为所激发起来的。美帝国主义在发动侵朝战争的同时，侵占了我国领土台湾，驱使其侵朝军队进逼我国边境，炸我城乡，杀我同胞，威胁我国安全，这就再清楚不过地说明了要保家卫国必须抗美援朝、抗美援朝就是保家卫国的道理。中国人民志愿军跨过鸭绿江，亲眼看到美帝国主义加于朝鲜人民身上的深重灾难。肥沃的田园荒芜了，城镇和乡村变成了一片废墟，年青人被抓走，妇女遭奸污，成千成百的爱国者和手无寸铁的人民遭到屠杀，战士们面对着美国野兽的罪行，面对着这些不忍卒睹的惨状，心中烧起了冲天的怒火。他们无比深刻地认识到：美帝国主义不仅是朝鲜人民的死敌，而且也是全中国全人类的死敌；朝鲜人民的苦难也就是我们自己和全人类的苦难。
      我们坚决遵循了毛主席的指示
        爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木
    中国人民志愿军的爱国主义和国际主义精神，在战争进程中日益提高和加强了。对敌人的切齿痛恨，对朝鲜人民的无限同情，对保卫祖国安全和世界和平的高度责任感，形成了每个战士取之不尽用之不竭的力量的源泉，形成了每个战士英勇无比和压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义气概。中国人民志愿军前司令员彭德怀同志早在一九五一年就曾经著文赞扬过这种精神，他写道：“志愿军的全体指挥员、战斗员，在战斗中表现了无比的英勇顽强和惊人的刻苦耐劳精神，在进攻中，不顾敌人炮火的猛烈，忘记一切疲劳和艰苦，爬山涉水，勇猛前进；在防守中，不论敌人的飞机炮火如何轰击，始终坚定沉着，固守阵地，大量杀伤敌人；即在敌我力量十分悬殊的情况下，也是临危不惧，顽强不屈，虽战至最后一人，仍不放弃阵地。许多英勇负伤的同志，坚持不下火线，继续进行战斗。许多壮烈牺牲的烈士临死之前，仍鼓励其他同志奋勇前进，消灭侵略军，争取胜利。志愿军的指挥员战斗员，曾经在零下三十度严寒、积雪数尺的高山上，连续作战数昼夜；曾经冒着敌人的炮火，徒涉刺骨的冰河，攻占敌人的防御阵地；曾经忍饥挨饿，仍坚决地完成自己的战斗任务。”三年战争中，涌现出功臣三十多万人，其中有率一个排粉碎敌人九次冲锋，最后抱起炸药包冲入敌群的著名英雄杨根思，有以自己的胸膛堵住敌人机枪火口掩护部队歼敌致胜的著名英雄黄继光，有黄继光式的英雄李家发，有带领两个战士打退敌人四十一次进攻歼灭敌人二百八十名的著名英雄胡修道，有忘我无畏的孤胆英雄陈复生，有扫雷英雄姚显儒，有孤胆作战，一个人坚持阵地三昼夜歼敌百余人，最后用石头同敌人搏斗的赖永泽，有在紧急情况下，毅然以身体扑向敌人的铁丝网为冲锋部队筑成人桥的李云峰、罗维新，有为了整体利益在潜伏中任凭烈火烧身而严守潜伏纪律的丘少云，有在腿被打断后，仍然坚持指挥战斗，拉响最后一个手榴弹滚向敌群与敌人同归于尽的著名英雄孙占元。许多说不完道不尽的光辉的英雄形象和他们惊天动地的革命英雄主义事迹，就是我们全军爱国主义和国际主义的鲜明标志。
    中国人民志愿军无论在极端困难的战时，无论在停战后的年月里，都坚决遵循着毛主席提出的：“要爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木”的指示。八年来，全军人员不仅模范地遵守了群众纪律，而且利用战斗和训练的空隙，经常帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕秋收，修渠治水，植树造林，修房盖屋，医疗治病，防疫救灾。特别在停战后，战士们还没有拂掉身上的战尘，就奔赴平壤、咸兴、新义州等重要城市的建筑工地和广大农村，以建设自己祖国的心情，积极参加了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建设工作。他们的口号是：“工地就是战场”，“多流一把汗，多增加一分友谊”，“以建设首都北京的心情建设平壤”。他们的劳动热情就如同在战场上的士气那样旺盛。有一首战士的诗歌反映了他们的这种可贵的精神面貌：
    为了友谊坝，
    再累也不怕；
    脱下衣和袜，
    下水把泥挖；
    泥水沾满身，
    谁也不理它；
    汗水如雨淋，
    浇开友谊花。
    八年来，据不完全统计，我们共帮助朝鲜人民修建公共场所八百八十一座，民房四万五千四百一十二间，恢复和新建大小桥梁四千二百六十三座，修建堤坝四千零九十六条，全长四十二万九千二百二十公尺，修建大小水渠二千二百九十五条，长达一百二十一万八千七百一十公尺，进行田间劳动八亿五千二百一十九万七千四百七十三坪，送粪一千三百一十四万六千零六十八担，植树三千六百零八万六千五百四十九棵，运送粮食物资六万三千八百五十三吨。战士们对待朝鲜人民的疾苦，就像对自己亲人的疾苦一样关心。八年来，特别在战时，志愿军官兵节衣缩食，以粮食二千一百二十六万零五百斤，衣物五十八万九千一百四十九件，帮助部分驻地人民渡过灾荒。为朝鲜人民治病一百八十八万三千九百七十五人次。伟大的国际主义战士罗盛教的榜样，就是我军的一面鲜明的国际主义旗帜。
    自从今年二月二十日志愿军总部发表撤军声明后，全体同志立刻积极响应了志愿军党委提出的“不骄不懈，善始善终，军队撤出，友谊长存”的号召和“交好、走好、到好”的要求。首先在全军范围内掀起了一个帮助朝鲜人民进行生产劳动的新高潮。从军官到士兵劳动热情空前高涨。他们不分白天黑夜，不顾风吹雨打，以冲天的革命干劲，协助朝鲜人民进行各种生产劳动。他们的原则是，当地群众需要什么就做什么，如修渠、筑坝、打井、盖房、修建校舍和公共场所。在劳动中，有病的同志也积极参加，劝都劝不下。他们说：“机会难得，爬也要爬去”。有的部队收工也收不住，他们说：我们代表着六亿祖国人民的心意，为了多留一分友谊，一定要多劳动一会。就这样，指标一次又一次地被突破。在相继撤军、人员逐渐减少和撤军工作繁忙的情况下，还超额百分之五百完成了一九五八年帮助朝鲜人民劳动的预定计划。
    志愿军广大官兵协助朝鲜人民进行恢复和建设的实际行动，是人民军队的本质，是军民一致的原则在新的条件下的发展和发扬，是国际主义觉悟的具体表现。同时，通过这一行动，又进一步提高了广大官兵国际主义的思想水平。
    在撤军过程中，一项十分重要的政治任务，就是要把防务交好。我们在把防务移交给朝鲜人民军的同时，各个部队都自觉而严格地按照交接规定把营房、营具和大量物资和成套的医院设备，无偿地移交给了我们亲密的战友——朝鲜人民军。战士们异口同声的说：“朝鲜是社会主义阵营的东方前哨，我们应当全力支援”，还说：“我们既可以在朝鲜牺牲流血，还有什么舍不得的”。是的，他们在国际主义思想的指导下，没有什么舍不得的。无论是广播员心爱的广播器材，放映员崭新的放映机，炊事员喂养的肥壮的鸡、鸭、鹅、猪或是别的什么，没有一件不是按照交接命令和上级的有关规定，完整无损地移交给朝鲜人民军。坑道堑壕、营房、营具、桌椅床铺，总是修了再修，刷了再刷。美化环境，整修和布置俱乐部，战士们悉心料理的精细程度无以复加。朝鲜人民军接防部队到达的时候，我军各级首长都率领部队敲锣打鼓夹道欢迎，把最好的房子腾出来让给人民军住，把细粮送给人民军吃，把自己最心爱的东西，如照片、纪念章、日记本、钢笔等送给人民军同志做为纪念品。战士们的快板写道：“人民军、志愿军，一个目标一条心，两个军队一家人，他和同胞一样亲”。
    中国人民志愿军从进入朝鲜到撤出朝鲜，八年如一日地执行了祖国人民的伟大意志和毛主席的英明教导，始终高举着无产阶级国际主义这面鲜明的旗帜，信守不渝地遵循了“要爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木”的指示。因此，对中国人民志愿军的广大官兵来说，他们没有辜负祖国人民所赐予的“最可爱的人”的光荣称号。
    战时朝鲜人民以忘我精神支援我们
      战后朝鲜人民无微不至地关怀我们
    中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民在长期并肩斗争中，我们深深地体会到：中朝两国的团结是在无产阶级国际主义的基础上的团结。中朝人民友谊的日益深厚，中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝斗争中的胜利和成就，广大官兵国际主义思想的日益提高，是与朝鲜人民对我们的关怀支援教导和勉励分不开的。
    远在中国人民历次国内革命战争和抗日战争中，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女曾经不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民的斗争。在反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，朝鲜人民和英雄的人民军，在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相正确领导下，不顾国土遭到破坏，不怕一切困难，英勇地坚持着反抗美国侵略的正义战争，抗击着世界上最强大的帝国主义侵略军队。朝鲜人民为争取战争的胜利，付出了很大代价，作出了重要贡献。这不仅是和平和社会主义力量同战争和帝国主义力量斗争中不可分割的一部分，而且是对我国人民最大和最直接的援助。现在，朝鲜人民和英雄的人民军站在反帝国主义的东方最前线，继续捍卫着远东和平，这仍然是对我国最直接的支援，这种援助的意义是无可估价的。
    还应当指出，在反抗美帝国主义侵略的战争中，我们亲密的战友——英雄的朝鲜人民军，发挥了强大的威力，并作出了巨大的贡献。这支英雄的军队和我们并肩作战，共同打败了美帝国主义。这两支人民的军队，亲密无间，协同作战，主动配合，互相支援，共同经历了艰难困苦，共同打败了敌人，取得了胜利。在战后的年月里，这两支军队在战斗友谊的基础上，进一步团结一致，互相学习，互相勉励，共同保卫着胜利的果实，防御着敌人可能的侵略。这种国际主义的战斗友谊，将与反抗侵略战争的胜利一样光辉地载入史册，万古长存。
    在战争中，朝鲜国土虽然遭到了美国侵略军的严重破坏，朝鲜人民虽然面临着极大的困难，但是，朝鲜人民却忍受了一切战争的灾难，以高度自我牺牲精神全力支持我们。在我军粮食供应不上的时候，宁愿自己忍饥受饿，也把粮食送到我们手里，在千里冰封的寒天，宁愿自己受冻，也把房子和暖炕让给我们住。为了支援我们作战，无论男女老少，他们不顾风雪严寒，冒着枪林弹雨抢救我军伤员，冒着敌机轰炸，不分昼夜地修桥铺路，保证运输畅通。据极不完全统计，在战争中为志愿军运送伤员和物资，出担架和战勤的人数就有三十万人次以上。在这些人中，有为保护我军伤员而献出自己生命的伟大的国际主义战士朴在根，有为抢救我军伤员而不顾亲生儿子安危的支前模范方兴福，有打开冰窟窿，为志愿军洗了七百件血衣的咸在福，有著名的志愿军妈妈、支前模范具富力、柳梅，有为了挖野菜支援我军而身负重伤的姑娘石吉荣，有为了从敌人囚室中救出我军被俘侦察员李治黄，派自己七岁儿子金永洙去割断侦察员身上的绳索而她自己与敌人同归于尽的安玉姬，有在飞虎山战斗中为了支援两天没吃上饭的部队，冒着敌人猛烈炮火，前仆后继，在牺牲三十多人的情况下，仍坚持爬上飞虎山主峰，终于把饭送到战士们手中的朝鲜农民。这许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹，使我们深感朝鲜人民如同我们的父母兄弟姊妹一样。朝鲜人民对我军的爱护和支援，我们将永远感念不忘。
    朝鲜人民勤劳勇敢、艰苦卓绝的战斗勇气和崇高的爱国主义和国际主义精神，极其深刻地教育了我们。志愿军广大官兵在抗美援朝的斗争中，进一步领会了无产阶级国际主义团结是不可战胜的这一颠扑不破的真理。
    战时，朝鲜人民在极端困难的环境下，以忘我的精神支援我们。战后，朝鲜人民在医治战争创伤，进行经济恢复和社会主义建设的过程中，直到我们撤出朝鲜的最后一分钟，仍然像对待自己的兄弟一样，无微不至地关怀和支援我们。在建造营房以前，志愿军部队大都住着朝鲜人民的房子，许许多多的朝鲜母亲对待志愿军战士就像对待自己的儿女一样。清晨，战士们外出训练或参加劳动时，她们就早早的把战士们的水壶灌满；晚上，战士们回来的时候，她们又争相替战士们缝补衣服，烤干鞋袜；深夜，战士们睡熟后，她们又悄悄地走进战士的房子去，看看被子盖好了没有，摸摸炕是否凉了。真是“亲如一家”。在这里，顺便再举两个例子：一九五六年二月下旬，朝鲜北部连日大雪，满载志愿军的两个列车，中途被数公尺深的大雪所阻，前进不得，后退不能，真是寸步难行，加之车上食物已尽，又无取暖设备，饥寒交加，十分危急。朝鲜人民闻讯后，一千多人立即自动从远道赶来救援。他们不顾一切危险，冒着大风大雪，把万余斤大米和大批木柴木炭送到列车上，人民军也出动飞机空投食物。这两个列车和车上的全部人员，终于在朝鲜军民全力支援下脱险。又如一九五八年一月十三日，驻守大和岛的志愿军的一个班长李荣箎患了阑尾炎，岛上无法治疗，病情恶化，必须迅速送到附近的椴岛才能实行手术，挽救李荣箎的生命。但是，当时海面结冰，行船停航，当该岛朝鲜劳动党的负责同志得知这一消息后，立即吻别自己的亲人，冒着生命危险，带了四名水手驾着一只小船到大和岛来接垂危中的病人。在往返途中，他们冒着七级大风卷起的巨浪，穿行在冰块夹缝之中，在万分危险之中挽救了志愿军战士的生命。
    八年来，朝鲜人民对待志愿军的深情厚谊是说不完也道不尽的。朝鲜妇女劳动模范韩玉芝，和志愿军战士一起在南阳里植了六十多万棵树后，用中文写出了这一深情，她写道：“一棵树，一颗心，棵棵树儿根连根，中朝人民心连心，青松翠柏万年青，中朝友谊比海深”。
    朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和人民，对中国人民志愿军进行的抗美援朝斗争，给以很高评价。八年来，朝鲜政府颁发数十万枚勋章、奖章赞扬和鼓励我们。金日成首相和党政其他领导人亲自到志愿军驻地或工地看望和鼓励我们，还经常派出最好的艺术团体和功勋演员为我们演出。八年来，文艺演出和电影放映不下千万次。逢年过节，大规模组织慰问代表团，带上大批礼物和慰问信对我军进行节日祝贺。代表慰问的次数达三千九百八十次，人数达八万八千九百七十五人之多，洋溢着深情厚谊的慰问信三十三万四千五百九十一封，各种各样的慰问品一百一十五万三千七百二十一件，赠送锦旗四千三百九十面。他们经常把最新鲜的水果和蔬菜、猪肉、大米、鲜鱼送给我们，这些物品包含着多么深厚的情谊。
    朝鲜政府和人民，对于长眠在朝鲜国土上的中国人民志愿军烈士的墓地——烈士陵园，尤其关怀备至。从白发苍苍的老人到系红领巾的小学生，他们把爱护中国人民志愿军的烈士陵园当作自己的一项崇高的国际主义使命。他们春天栽鲜花，夏天除杂草，秋天扫落叶，冬天铲积雪。一年四季，敬献花圈，逢年过节，进行悼念。他们把每一个烈士陵园都整理的像公园一样优美，并把它当成对后代子孙进行国际主义教育的场所。有一位看守烈士陵园的老人在同我们临别时说：“请转告烈士们的父母兄弟妻子儿女，只要有朝鲜人民在，就一定要把烈士墓保护得好好的”。对此，不仅我们和烈士们的家属将感谢不尽，就是长眠在朝鲜国土的烈士们，也当含笑九泉。
    朝鲜人民八年来一直是无微不至的关怀和爱护着中国人民志愿军，在我们撤军开始后，更形成了一个全民性的高潮。为了欢送我们，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁作出了专门决定。以金日成首相为首的党和国家的领导人亲自到归国部队送行。制作数十万枚朝中友谊纪念章赠送给我们作纪念。发动全民签名并以全民的名义写信赞扬感谢我们和中国人民，这封信以及成千上万封慰问信，字里行间都充满着朝中两国人民的真情实谊。我们参加修的堤，筑的坝，盖的学校，朝鲜各地人民以最好的名字来命名。朝鲜政府从各方面帮助我们执行撤军任务，抽调全国最优秀的火车司机和大批列车运送部队，各地人民自动修桥铺路，便利军车通行，沿途到处设有茶水站。邀请我军干部到风景最优美的地区去游览、参观和疗养。朝鲜人民争相把自己最有意义的珍贵礼物送给我们，其中有祖传几代的宝剑，有战时的纪念品，有用布口袋装着战场上的泥土，有小学生的红领巾，有姑娘们的绣花枕头，有老太太结婚时的耳环戒指等。件件都充分表达了朝鲜人民对我们的热爱。当部队出发时，驻地附近的群众更是盛装夹道欢送。从朝鲜的首都平壤到各道郡的所在地，从登车站起到沿途每个停车站，每当部队经过时都有盛大的集会，从几万人到几十万人。这些欢送和告别的场面是极感人动人的。每个集会都是五彩缤纷，旗帜招展，载歌载舞，锣鼓喧天，热泪盈眶，难舍难分。从将军到士兵，从系红领巾的儿童到白发苍苍的老人，他们都紧紧地抱在一起，欢度这最宝贵的时刻。身临其境的人，无不从内心深处流露出彼此感激和相互留恋的深情。有时，连富有经验的摄影师，也因为止不住激情的热泪而无法拍摄下去。朝鲜人民对我们的深情，将永远留在我们的记忆里。对于这些，我们不仅有责任向祖国人民汇报，并且将以实际行动来答谢朝鲜人民。一个战士曾向一位送行的朝鲜母亲说：“如果美帝国主义胆敢再次向朝鲜人民发动战争，只要朝鲜母亲招唤一声，我们就再次跨过鸭绿江来抗美援朝。”这足以代表所有战士的心意。
    在撤军中所表现出来的这些难以叙述的情景，是朝中两国人民传统友谊获得巩固和发展的新的证明，也是朝中友谊和两国人民团结威力的一次大检阅。这是一种伟大的友谊，这种友谊是建立在无产阶级及国际主义思想基础上的，这种友谊是以鲜血凝成的，这种友谊是经过了严峻考验的。“朝中友谊比天高，朝中友谊比海深”，这就是用不同文字写出的共同语言。由此可见：中朝两国人民的战斗友谊不仅是极其珍贵的，而且具有伟大的生命力，它不仅永远是我们中朝两国人民战胜共同敌人的有力保障，而且有利于两国人民沿着社会主义道路并肩前进，有利于加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。
    我们光荣地完成抗美援朝的历史任务
    现在立即站到祖国最需要的岗位上去
    综上所述，中国人民志愿军出国八年来，已经光荣地完成了祖国人民交给它抗美援朝这一历史任务。我们在第二次世界大战后最大一次的现代化战争中，打败了敌人，取得了胜利，也取得了丰富的现代化作战经验。八年来，志愿军的广大官兵，为祖国、为人民、为中朝友谊、为远东和世界和平，尽到了他们应尽的义务。为此而献出了自己生命的烈士们和他们的英雄事迹永垂史册！
    抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，是党和毛主席英明领导的结果，是祖国人民全力支援的结果。
    早在中国革命取得全国胜利之初，毛主席就教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争时，毛主席又号召我们：“全国和全世界的人民团结起来，进行充分的准备，打败美帝国主义的任何挑衅。”全国人民在党和毛主席的教导下，不仅在精神上具有充分的准备，而且进行了一系列反侵略战争的准备工作。当美帝国主义者无视我国政府和人民的一再警告，指挥他们的侵略军队进逼我国边境，在这个决定中国人民命运的严重时刻里，党和毛主席正确地分析了当时的国际国内局势，预计战争进程的复杂情况，把握了必胜的条件，毅然领导全国人民掀起了伟大的抗美援朝运动。这样，志愿军就迅速组织起来了，高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的正义旗帜，跨过鸭绿江，以劣势装备抗击全副现代装备的美国侵略者。抗美援朝斗争的胜利不仅证明了毛主席关于“美帝国主义只不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎”的英明论断，而且证明了毛主席指导战争的学说是战无不胜的学说。抗美援朝的伟大胜利，就是党和毛主席英明决策的胜利，就是毛主席思想的胜利。
    在抗美援朝斗争中，我国六亿五千万人民在党和毛主席英明领导下，一方面进行着浩繁的经济恢复工作和社会主义建设事业，一方面在全国范围内展开了伟大的抗美援朝运动，直接支援了志愿军。祖国人民的全力支援，使我们得到源源不断的物资供应和正气磅礴的精神鼓舞。我们还记得，工人阶级的弟兄曾提出：“工厂就是战场，机器就是枪炮”的口号；农民弟兄曾提出：“要人有人，要粮有粮”的保证；全民性的捐献飞机运动，使我们迅速地改善了装备；大规模的优待烈、军属的工作，鼓舞了广大官兵的士气，慰问代表团和艺术团体的慰问和演出，丰富了前线将士们的精神生活。八年来，党和毛主席的领导，祖国人民的巨大努力和全力支援，是抗美援朝这一伟大胜利的决定性的保证。志愿军的全体同志，都将牢牢记住：光荣属于党和毛主席，光荣属于祖国人民。
    我们离别祖国只有八年的时间，然而，我们伟大的祖国已经比八年前强大得无可比拟了。全国人民的政治觉悟空前提高，六万万五千万人民，正在“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线”的光辉照耀下，以大跃进和“一天等于二十年”的英雄气魄，以无穷无尽的力量和智慧，加速我国社会主义建设。无论工业、农业、科学、文化事业，到处都涌现出惊人的奇迹。从今年麦收以来，在农业战线上发射了成批的高产“卫星”，钢产量今年一年就要翻一番，整个国民经济的发展，有如青云直上。这是自有史以来从未有过的高速度。我们在国外的儿女，无时不为祖国社会主义建设的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。现在回到祖国来了，我们首要的任务，就是向祖国人民学习，立即站到最需要的岗位上去，以祖国人民大跃进的精神和冲天的革命干劲，为祖国的社会主义建设直接贡献出自己的一切力量。
    目前，美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，全部解放祖国领土的任务还没有完成。解放台、澎、金、马是中国人民自己的事，绝不容美国人插手。制造“两个中国”的阴谋，是六亿中国人民所绝不容许的。我们希望台、澎、金、马的同胞们响应祖国的号召，团结一致，反对美帝国主义干涉我国的内政。中国人民一定要把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，台、澎、金、马一定要回到祖国的怀抱。我们归国的中国人民志愿军全体同志，准备随时听候祖国的召唤，为解放台、澎、金、马而贡献自己的一切力量。
    让我们同全国人民团结一起，为尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家而共同奋斗。
    为抗美援朝牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    我们伟大的祖国和人民万岁！
    我们事业的舵手　　中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
                  （文内小标题是本报编者加的）
