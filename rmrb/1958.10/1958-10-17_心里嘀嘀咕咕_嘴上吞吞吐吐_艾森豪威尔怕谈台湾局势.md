Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th. U.S. President Eisenhower discussed on the 15th, at a press conference, the issue of the United States wanting the Chiang Kai-shek clique to reduce the number of troops stationed on the Jinmen (Quemoy) and other coastal islands.

It seems that due to this U.S. plan, and Dulles's remarks at the end of last month scolding the Chiang Kai-shek clique for "foolishly" concentrating a large number of troops on the coastal islands, which have aroused great panic and resentment among members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Eisenhower, like Dulles the day before, came out again to appease them, saying that "we will not and do not want to force them" on matters that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "considers vital to their survival."

However, in explaining Dulles's remarks the previous day, Eisenhower reiterated that Dulles and the U.S. government still believe that there are "too many troops" stationed on this "forward position" and that "this is illogical."

A reporter asked Eisenhower whether he had received any indication from Chiang Kai-shek "that he would agree to reduce his troops on these islands if the United States helped him defend Jinmen and Mazu with increased firepower." Eisenhower replied that he had "not" received such an indication. Eisenhower spoke as little as possible about the Taiwan situation at the press conference. He said, "There is no benefit in issuing a public statement now that might be misunderstood in Taipei..." According to an Associated Press reporter, Eisenhower and Dulles "apparently agreed that the issue was too delicate to risk embarrassing Chiang Kai-shek or the Nationalist government."

    心里嘀嘀咕咕　嘴上吞吞吐吐
    艾森豪威尔怕谈台湾局势
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔15日在记者招待会上，谈论美国要蒋介石集团减少驻在金门等沿海岛屿上的军队人数问题。
    看来，由于美国这个策划，以及杜勒斯上月底斥骂蒋介石集团“愚蠢”地在沿海岛屿集结大量兵力的谈话，已经激起蒋介石集团人士很大的惊慌和愤懑，因此，艾森豪威尔这次同杜勒斯在前一天一样，又出来进行安抚说，在蒋介石集团“认为他们的生存所系的事情上，我们不会也不想强迫他们”。
    但是，艾森豪威尔在解释杜勒斯前一天的谈话时，重申杜勒斯和美国政府仍然认为，在这个“前卫阵地”“是驻兵太多了”，“这是不合逻辑的”。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔，是否已从蒋介石那里得到任何表示，“表明假如美国用加强了的火力来帮他保卫金门和马祖，他就会同意减少他在这些岛屿上的驻军”。艾森豪威尔回答说，他还“没有”得到这种表示。艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上尽可能少谈台湾局势问题。他说，“现在发表一项可能在台北受到误解的公开声明，……是没有什么好处的”。据美联社记者指出，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯“显然一致认为，这个问题太微妙了，因而不能冒使蒋介石或国民党政府感到狼狈的危险”。
