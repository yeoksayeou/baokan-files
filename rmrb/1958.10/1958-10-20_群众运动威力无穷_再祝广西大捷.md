    The Infinite Power of Mass Movements
    ——Another Congratulations on the Great Victory in Guangxi
    The day before yesterday, we had just congratulated Guangxi's Huanjiang County on its great victory of producing more than 60,000 tons of iron in one day and Xincheng County on mining more than 600,000 tons of coal in one day. The excitement in our hearts had not yet subsided, and the news of these two "big satellites" soaring into the sky was being passed on in a competitive spirit throughout the country. Today, new good news has come from Guangxi: Luzhai County, with the support of Liujiang, Rongan, Shilong counties, and the Miao Autonomous County of Damiaoshan, has launched a "super-large satellite" with a daily output of more than 200,000 tons of pig iron. This is another victory for the people of Guangxi and another victory for the Party's mass movement.
    How many years in history does that one day in Luzhai County equal? It is impossible for us to calculate. "The sea cannot be measured with a dipper." For the people of our era, for the miracles created by these people, it is difficult to make comparisons using any historical high-speed records. History is not sufficient; even the leaping-forward indicators that best express the wishes and determination of our people sometimes cannot measure the value of the thousands of miracles actually created by our people. During Guangxi's first Five-Year Plan period, the total output of pig iron was only more than 17,000 tons. This year, the state assigned Guangxi a pig iron production target of 200,000 tons. The output will increase sharply by dozens of times, from more than 17,000 tons in five years to 200,000 tons in one year, which cannot be said to be a very amazing advanced indicator. But who would have thought that Luzhai County only worked for one day and overfulfilled the entire year's pig iron production task of the entire Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. This event most fully illustrates that the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China have unparalleled power; in the face of such great people, mountains must bow their heads, the sea must give way, and all things in the universe must obey their commands!
    The great victory in Luzhai, together with the great victories in Huanjiang, Nandan and other counties reported a few days ago, and the victories on the iron smelting front in other counties in Guangxi, have enabled the entire Guangxi to complete the annual pig iron production task more than two months ahead of schedule and greatly overfulfill it. This great victory in Guangxi was certainly not easily achieved, but was the result of the intense struggle of the people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi. Some people used to be very unaccustomed and disapproved of this kind of intense battle life. They always thought that tension was a bad thing, on the grounds that it was "chaotic" and "disrupted the order of life," and so on. The great victory in iron smelting in Guangxi most concretely shows that our current tension is a good thing. The people of Guangxi worked hard for a while and produced hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron, passed the pig iron barrier, and relaxed. Isn't this a good thing? Without yesterday's tension, there would be no today's relaxation; if you want to relax, you must first be tense. What's wrong with going from tension to relaxation? Of course, the relaxation mentioned here is only relative. When the quantity problem is solved, there is still the quality problem; when the pig iron problem is solved, there is still the steelmaking problem. For those who believe in continuous revolution, idle relaxation is unimaginable.
    It is true that things are "chaotic" as soon as there is tension. However, what's wrong with "chaos"? "Heroes emerge in troubled times." If the Kuomintang's rule was not chaotic, there would be no rule by the Communist Party. If old scientific conclusions are not disrupted, there will be no new scientific achievements. If people always follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and never deviate, they will not reach new heights. The people of Guangxi are smelting iron and steel in a "chaotic" way. Huanjiang uses lime kilns to smelt iron, Luzhai even uses old blockhouses and old bunkers to smelt iron, and Liuzhou uses cupolas for melting iron to directly make steel. These are really unheard-of things, extremely "chaotic." However, what's wrong with this? These methods of iron smelting and steelmaking, although not found in books, have been successful in practice. This is the original creation of the Chinese people! Although bunker iron smelting and cupola steelmaking are not very mature as ideal methods today; especially, it is necessary to continue to work hard to further improve the quality of pig iron and steel. However, the bold and original spirit of the people of Guangxi makes us even more confident that in the mass movement of 50 million people making steel and iron, and in the creative labor of breaking with conventions and displaying their unique abilities, we will be able to sum up a new, more scientific, and more progressive set of steelmaking and iron smelting methods.
    As for saying that "the order of life is disrupted" after tension, then we must say that life should originally be tense, and tension is the characteristic of the order of life in our era. If we want to get rid of the heavy burden of poverty and backwardness left to us by history, if we want to build socialism, and if we want to ascend to the communist paradise, can we not be tense? It can be seen that tension is not an external pressure that "disrupts the order of life," but is a requirement of life itself and reflects the essence of life.
    The intense struggle of the people of Guangxi has yielded fruitful results. At this moment, filled with passion, we look to the southern border of the motherland and congratulate the more than 19 million brothers and sisters in Guangxi. But we know that this is not the end. Our era is an era of heroic figures. Who will lead the steel leaping-forward list tomorrow remains to be seen. While we congratulate Guangxi on its great victory for the second time, and hope that the people of Guangxi will consolidate their achievements and strive for greater victories, we are also waiting for good news from other parts of the motherland!

    群众运动威力无穷
    ——再祝广西大捷
    前天，我们刚祝贺了广西环江县一天生产六万多吨铁和忻城县一天采了六十多万吨煤的伟大胜利，兴奋的心还没有平静，这两颗“大卫星”腾空而起的消息还正在祖国各地竞相传递，今天却又从广西传来了新的捷报：鹿寨县在柳江、融安、石龙等县和大苗山苗族自治县的支援下，放出了日产生铁二十万多吨的“特大卫星”。这是广西人民的又一胜利，是党的群众运动的又一胜利。
    鹿寨县的这一天，究竟等于历史上的多少年，是我们无法计算的。“海水不可斗量”，对于我们这个时代的人民，对于这些人民所创造的奇迹，用任何历史上的高速度纪录来做对比，都是困难的。历史，不足为准；甚至连最能表现我们人民的愿望和决心的跃进指标，有时也量不出我们的人民实际创造的千万个奇迹的价值。广西第一个五年计划期间生铁的总产量才一万七千多吨，今年国家给广西分配的生铁生产任务是二十万吨。从五年一万七千多吨到一年二十万吨，产量要猛增几十倍，这不能不说是非常惊人的先进指标。但谁又能想到，鹿寨县只干了一天，就超额完成了整个广西僮族自治区全年的生铁生产任务。这件事，最充分地说明了中国共产党领导下的中国人民，具有无比的威力；在这样伟大的人民的面前，山要低头，海要让路，宇宙万物要听从使唤！
    鹿寨大捷，加上前几天报道的环江、南丹等县大捷和广西其他县炼铁战线上的胜利，已经使整个广西全年的生铁生产任务，提前两个多月，并且大大超额完成了。广西的这个大胜仗，当然不是轻易获致的，而是广西各族人民紧张奋战的结果。这种紧张的战斗生活，曾经是有些人很不习惯，很不以为然的。他们总认为紧张是一件坏事，理由是“乱糟糟的”、“打乱了生活的秩序”等等。广西炼铁大捷，最具体地说明了我们现在的这种紧张，是一件好事。广西人民紧张地干了一阵，干出几十万吨生铁来，闯过了生铁关，轻松起来，这不是好事吗？没有昨天的紧张，就没有今天的轻松；欲要轻松，必先紧张。由紧张而轻松，这有什么不好呢？当然，这里说的轻松，也只是相对的。数量问题解决了，还有质量问题；生铁问题解决了，还有炼钢问题。对于不断革命论者说来，无所事事的轻松是难以想像的。
    一紧张就“乱糟糟的”，这确是实情。然而，“乱”又有什么不好呢？“乱世出英雄”，不乱国民党的天下，就没有共产党的天下；不乱旧的科学结论，就没有新的科学成果。人要是永远沿着先人的脚印走路，一步不乱，就达不到新的天地。广西人民炼钢铁，是“乱糟糟的”。环江用石灰窑炼铁、鹿寨竟用旧炮楼、旧碉堡炼铁，柳州用化铁用的冲天炉直接炼钢，这真是些闻所未闻的事情，“乱”极了。然而，这又有什么不好呢？这些炼铁的方法，炼钢的方法，尽管是书本上没有的，但已在实践中获得成功。这是中国人民的独创！虽然，碉堡炼铁、冲天炉炼钢，作为一种十分理想的方法来说，今天还不很成熟；特别是要使生铁和钢的质量进一步提高，还需要继续努力。但广西人民的大胆独创精神，却使我们更加相信，在五千万人炼钢炼铁的群众运动中，在打破陈规，各显神通的创造性的劳动中，必能总结出一套新的，更加科学，更加进步的炼钢炼铁方法。
    至于说到紧张之后“打乱了生活的秩序”，那么，我们要说，生活原来就应该是紧张的，紧张是我们这个时代生活秩序的特点。我们要摆脱历史遗留给我们的贫穷和落后的重担，要建设社会主义，要登入共产主义的天堂，不紧张行吗？可见，紧张不是外来的压力，以致“打乱了生活的秩序”，而是生活本身的要求，反映了生活的本质。
    广西人民的紧张奋战，结出了丰硕的果实。此刻，我们满怀着激情，遥望祖国的南疆，向广西一千九百余万兄弟姐妹祝贺。但我们知道这不是顶点。我们的时代是英雄辈出的时代。钢铁跃进榜上，明天谁家领先，还待分晓。当我们二次祝广西大捷，希望广西人民巩固成绩，争取更大胜利的同时，我们也等待着来自祖国其他地方的捷报！
