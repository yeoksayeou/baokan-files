    Gagging Record
    Poem by Li Xu, Painting by Ying Tao
    Reported: A farce was staged at the British Conservative Party conference… The annual meeting was noisy and chaotic, everyone chattering and boasting about their "achievements," you putting on rouge, he applying powder, war criminals vying to brag about being "heroes." Macmillan strode up excitedly, about to talk about his "merits," when a delegate interrupted: the unemployment problem is too serious! … Before the words finished, people moved, the mouth was gagged by someone else, a shout and they dragged him out, beaten black and blue. British gentlemen boast of "freedom," freedom is only on the lips, the gagging performance is a good footnote, the joke spreads across the five continents! (Attached picture)

    封嘴记
    李旭诗　英韬画
    报载：英国保守党年会上演丑剧……年会开得闹哄哄，咭咭呱呱各表“功”，你涂胭脂他抹粉，战犯争夸是“英雄”。麦克米伦兴冲冲，正把“功劳”说一通，有一代表把话插：失业问题太严重！……语声未落人群动，嘴巴便被别人封，吆喝一声抬出去，打得鼻青脸发肿。英国绅士夸“自由”，自由只挂口上头，封嘴表演好注脚，笑话传遍五大洲！（附图片）
