    Sending Melon Seeds from Afar
    Ouyang Ying, Xudun Agricultural Cooperative, Jian'ou, Fujian

    At dusk when we were finishing work, Xiao Zhou came to me with a parcel notification slip and said, "This is something! It's from Xinjiang." As soon as I heard that it was a parcel from Xinjiang, my heart was overjoyed.

    I put down my hoe, didn't even wash my feet, and ran five *li* to the Xudun postal agency to pick up the parcel. I walked back to the cooperative happily, with feelings of gratitude surging in my chest.

    Four months ago, I was sent to the mountainous area of Fujian to participate in labor training. This village has a rich diversified economy, especially famous for its watermelons. Several comrades who came with me all set out leap forward plans, deciding to establish small-scale breeding farms for improved poultry and experimental farms for improved plant varieties. I thought that the land in Hudu Village was suitable for growing melons, and how wonderful it would be if we could try growing the nationally famous Hami melons! So I wrote a letter to the CPC Hami County Committee in Xinjiang, asking them to support us. More than a month after I sent my letter, today I actually received the Hami melon seeds sent from thousands of miles away. I looked at them carefully and found that this package was different from any package I had received in the past. Even the package my mother sent me was not like this. It was packed so tightly and sealed so securely, with every small seam sewn up densely with thread. What was even more special was that the package was sewn with brand new red cloth. In our mountainous area of Fujian, red symbolizes "auspiciousness," "prosperity," and "success." From the red cloth, I saw the heart of the person who sent the package.

    万里迢迢寄瓜种
    福建建瓯徐墩农业社　欧阳英
    傍晚收工的时候，小舟拿着一张包裹通知单对我说：“不简单呀！新疆寄来的。”一听说新疆寄来的包裹单，我心里就乐得开了花。
    我把锄头一放，脚也没洗，飞跑了五里路到徐墩邮政代办所领来了包裹，高高兴兴的走回社里去，感激的心情一直在我胸里激荡着。
    四个月前，我下放到福建山区，来参加劳动锻炼。这个村子的多种经济很丰富、特别是西瓜更有名，我们同来的几个同志都订出了跃进规划，决定搞小型的良种家禽试验场和植物良种试验场。我想胡豆村土地适合种瓜，要是能够试种全国闻名的哈密瓜那该多好呢！我就给中共新疆哈密县委写了一封信，请他们来支援我们。我的信寄去了一个多月，今天果然接到了从万里迢迢地寄来的哈密瓜种子。我细细的看着，发觉这包裹和我过去接到过的任何包裹都不同，就连我母亲寄给我的包裹也不像这样，包得那么紧，封得那么密，每条小缝都用针线密密麻麻的缝了起来，更特别的是包裹是用全新的红布缝制成的。在我们福建山区红色是象征“吉利”、“兴旺”、“发达”的。从红色的布上，我看到了那位寄包裹的人的心。
