    Peanut "Satellites" Keep Getting Bigger
    --Over 40,000 Jin Per Mu
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Red Hero People's Commune in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, harvested 41,533 jin of peanuts from 1.02 mu of land, equivalent to a yield of 40,719 jin per mu. This is 5,296 jin higher than the county's previous record of 35,423 jin per mu.
    This high-yield land was created by the famous "Peanut Girl," Wu Fenglai, the vice-chairman of the Red Hero People's Commune, and the eight young women she leads. On October 12th, the county party committee and the county people's committee jointly organized an inspection team to conduct the acceptance check. He Tiran, the deputy director of the Huanggang Special District Agricultural Bureau, also participated in the inspection.
    The main measures they adopted to increase production were: deep plowing three times, applying fertilizer in layers and mixed application, high-density planting, timely loosening of the soil and weeding, and earthing up the roots.

    花生“卫星”愈放愈大
    ——亩产四万多斤
    本报讯　湖北省红安县红色英雄人民公社在一点○二亩花生地里，实收花生四万一千五百三十三斤，折合亩产四万零七百一十九斤，比这个县前些时间创造的亩产三万五千四百二十三斤的纪录还高五千二百九十六斤。
    这块高额丰产地是著名的“花生姑娘”、红色英雄人民公社副社长吴凤来和她领导的八个姑娘创造的。10月12日县委与县人民委员会共同组织了验收组前往验收。黄岗专署农业局副局长何倜然也参加了这次验收。
    她们所采取的增产措施，主要是：深耕三次，分层施肥和混合施肥，高度密植，及时松土锄草，培土壅兜等。
