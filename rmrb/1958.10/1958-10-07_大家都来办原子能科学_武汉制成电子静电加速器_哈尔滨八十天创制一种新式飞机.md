Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th - The Wuhan Atomic Energy Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully manufactured an electrostatic accelerator at the end of September.

This accelerator can be widely used in industry, agriculture, and medicine and health. In industry, it can be used for flaw detection of heavy castings, and its discrimination rate far exceeds low-energy X-rays and ultrasonic flaw detection equipment; it can change the structure of polymer materials and increase their mechanical strength; it can accelerate the growth of crops, improve the quality of crop varieties, and kill insects; it can increase the storage time of meat and some grains; it can treat cancer; and it can completely replace the use of X-ray machines.

The Wuhan Atomic Energy Research Institute was recently established by the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, Huazhong Institute of Technology, and relevant factories. As soon as this atomic energy research institute was established, it adhered to the principle of building and working simultaneously. In half a month, after hard work and intensive study, it manufactured this accelerator.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 5th - Another type of light passenger transport aircraft designed and manufactured by our country recently had a successful test flight in Harbin.

This new aircraft, named "Songhua River No. 1," was manufactured by the Harbin Machinery Factory. It only took eighty-one days from the start of design to the success of the test flight. Most of the technicians who designed and manufactured this aircraft were novices.

This aircraft is light, flexible, and easy to operate. It is piloted by one person and can seat five to seven passengers. It only needs more than eight kilograms of gasoline to fly one hundred li. In addition to being used as a passenger plane, it can also be used for forest protection, geological survey, aerial surveying, medical rescue, etc.; with slight modifications, it can also be used for agricultural fertilization, pest control, and sowing.

    大家都来办原子能科学
    武汉制成电子静电加速器
    哈尔滨八十天创制一种新式飞机
    新华社武汉6日电　中国科学院武汉原子能研究所在9月底制成一座电子静电加速器。
    这种加速器能广泛应用于工业、农业和医药卫生方面。在工业上，它可以用于重型铸件探伤，其鉴别率大大超过低能X射线和超声波等探伤设备；它可以改变高分子聚合物的结构，增加其机械强度；它可以加速农作物的成长，提高农作物的品种质量，可以杀虫；可以增加肉类和某些粮食的储藏时间；可以治疗癌症；可以完全代替X光机的用途。
    武汉原子能研究所是不久前由中国科学院武汉分院和武汉大学、华中工学院及有关工厂合作建成的。这个原子能研究所一建立，就本着边建边干的方针，在半个月的时间里，经过苦干苦钻，就把这座加速器制成。
    据新华社哈尔滨5日电　我国自行设计制造的又一种轻型旅客运输飞机最近在哈尔滨试飞成功。
    这架命名为“松花江一号”的新式飞机，是由哈尔滨机械厂制造的，从开始设计到试飞成功只用了八十一天。设计和制造这架飞机的技术人员，大部分都是新手。
    这种飞机轻便灵活，操纵方便，由一个人驾驶，可以坐五个到七个乘客。飞行一百里只需要八公斤多汽油。除可用作客机外，还可用作保护森林、地质勘察、航空测量、医疗救护等；如果稍加改装，还可用作农业施肥、灭虫、播种等。（附图片）
