    Commendable Spirit of Communist Collaboration
    Anhui Transfers Another 200,000 Hogs
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 23rd – Anhui commercial departments are demonstrating a commendable spirit of communist collaboration by increasing the transfer of a large number of hogs to supply Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Liaoning, among other places. After completing the year's target of transferring 390,000 hogs ahead of schedule in July (excluding those for export), the province further transferred nearly 200,000 hogs to supply the aforementioned regions. Anhui commercial departments believe that supplying the people of the capital and other major cities and industrial and mining areas with as many hogs as possible is their glorious duty.

    可贵的共产主义协作精神
    安徽又调出二十万头生猪
    据新华社合肥23日电　安徽商业部门发挥共产主义协作精神，增加调拨大量生猪供应上海、北京、天津和辽宁等地。全省提前在7月份完成了今年三十九万头生猪的外调任务（不包括提供出口的）以后，又增调了将近二十万头生猪供应上述地区。安徽商业部门认为，尽可能多调些猪供应首都和其他大城市、工矿区的人民，是他们的光荣义务。
