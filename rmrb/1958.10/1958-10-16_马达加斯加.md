    Madagascar
    Madagascar is located in the Indian Ocean, southeast of the African continent, and is the world's fifth largest island. It covers an area of 592,000 square kilometers and has a population of approximately five million. The residents are the Malagasy people.
    Madagascar was originally an independent kingdom. As early as the beginning of the 14th century, the people of Madagascar established their own country. From the 15th century onwards, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British colonists began commercial plunder and slave trading pirate activities in Madagascar. In 1896, France forcibly occupied Madagascar and designated it as a colony.
    After World War II, with the rise of the Asian-African national independence movement, the struggle of the Malagasy people for independence entered a new stage. In 1946, they organized the "Movement for Democratic Renovation of Madagascar." This organization became the people's front in the struggle of the Malagasy people against French colonial rule and for national independence. In 1947, a massive national uprising broke out on the island. The insurgents occupied many towns. The French colonists brutally suppressed the uprising, massacring as many as 89,000 people. However, the Malagasy people did not yield under the bayonets of France. After the uprising, they established many political organizations and trade union organizations striving for national independence, and continued to fight for national independence in various ways. Although in the "referendum" held on September 28 this year under the strict control of the French colonial authorities, the people of Madagascar were unable to express their desire for independence like the people of Guinea, there were still more than 390,000 patriotic people who bravely voted against it, regardless of threats and inducements.

    马达加斯加
    马达加斯加位于印度洋中，在非洲大陆东南方，是世界第五大岛。面积计五十九万二千平方公里，人口约五百万。居民为马拉加西人。
    马达加斯加原为一个独立王国，早在十四世纪初叶，马达加斯加人民就建立了自己的国家。从十五世纪起，葡萄牙、荷兰、法国、英国殖民者就开始在马达加斯加进行商业性掠夺与贩卖奴隶的海盗活动。1896年法国强占马达加斯加，并把它划为殖民地。
    在第二次世界大战后，随着亚非民族独立运动的高涨，马达加斯加人民争取独立的斗争进入了新的阶段，1946年他们组织了“马达加斯加民主革新运动”。这个组织成了马达加斯加人民为反对法国殖民统治、争取民族独立斗争中的人民阵线。1947年岛上人民爆发了声势浩大的民族起义。起义者占领了许多城镇。法殖民者对起义进行了残酷的镇压，屠杀了八万九千人之多。但是马达加斯加人民并没有在法国的刺刀下屈服，他们在起义后又成立了许多争取民族独立的政治组织与工会组织，以各种方式继续进行着争取民族独立的斗争。尽管在今年9月28日在法国殖民当局的严密控制下举行的“公民投票”中，马达加斯加人没有能像几内亚人那样表达出要求独立的意志，但是仍然有三十九万多爱国人民不顾威胁利诱勇敢地投了反对票。
