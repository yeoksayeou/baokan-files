    This newspaper reports that amid the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production across the country, museum work, illuminated by the brilliance of the General Line, has seen an unprecedented leap forward. Many places have established museums after only a few days of hard work. Especially after the Ministry of Culture held two national on-site conferences in Henan and Anhui on the leap forward in cultural relics and museums, the development of museums in various regions has sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. More than 90% of counties in Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces have established museums, and more than 60% of counties in Jilin, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces have also established museums, basically realizing a museum network. As of the end of September, according to incomplete statistics, 865 newly established county-level gazetteer museums have been established nationwide, plus the original 72 museums of various types, totaling 937, a thirteen-fold increase compared to last year, surpassing Britain and ranking third in the world.

    These museums are completely new types of socialist museums. They serve politics and production and are powerful propaganda tools for the Party to promote its central tasks. The content of their exhibitions mainly reflects the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses under the illumination of the General Line, as well as the beautiful future prospects, promotes technological innovation experience, introduces advanced production experiences, and popularizes scientific knowledge. It completely shatters the mistaken notion that museums can only be cold and quiet places for antiques, and also overcomes the erroneous idea that museums can only be run by "experts" and not by the masses. This is a great victory in the struggle between two lines in China's museum cause.

    The masses are extremely welcoming of this new type of museum. After the opening of the Yilan County Museum in Heilongjiang, the audience reached more than 20,000 people in just five days. After the opening of the Feicheng County Museum in Shandong, the masses praised it, saying: "The museum is an important place to point the direction, learn technology, show achievements, and praise the present age." Others expressed their feelings with clapper talk: "After seeing the museum, it's like wiping our eyes, if we work hard, socialism will be realized."

    According to the experience of establishing museums in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong, Jilin, and other places, the main points are: (1) The purpose of building a museum is clear, closely integrated with the Party's central work. Many county museums were established during the rectification movement, the socialist great debate, and the great leap forward in production. They used the exhibits to powerfully refute right-leaning thoughts and onlookers, and to encourage the masses' confidence in increasing production, serving the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; (2) The Party committee takes personal leadership, cooperates with business departments, and implements the mass line. In Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang, thanks to the importance attached by the Party committee, all twelve counties in the prefecture established museums in just a few months. In the work of establishing a museum in Gaochun County, Jiangsu, the county party committee attached great importance to it, arranging museum work at the meetings of the party secretaries of various townships, and the county party committee propaganda department held two on-site meetings to study the work of building a museum; (3) Break superstitions, dare to think and dare to do. There is nothing "mysterious" about running a museum. In the work of county-run museums, there are neither "experts" nor "artists." Models, specimens, sand tables, and charts are all made by the masses themselves, learning by doing; (4) Run museums diligently and thriftily, making the best use of whatever is available. They spend little money and use few people, and there is no need to build new buildings. Generally, tens or hundreds of yuan are enough. Jiangning County in Jiangsu only spent 15 yuan, 1 dime, and 6 fen, and built a museum in three and a half days.

### 反映当前重大成就　展示将来美好前途  群众动手大办新型博物馆

    反映当前重大成就　展示将来美好前途
    群众动手大办新型博物馆
    本报讯　在全国工农业生产大跃进中，博物馆工作在总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了空前的跃进局面，许多地方苦战几天就办起了博物馆，特别是文化部在河南、安徽开了两次全国文物、博物馆跃进现场会议以后，各地博物馆的发展如雨后春笋。河南、山东、安徽等省已有90％以上的县建立了博物馆，吉林、福建、浙江、湖南、湖北、山西等省也都有60％以上的县建立了博物馆，基本上实现了博物馆网。截至9月底为止，据不完全统计，全国新建立的县地志博物馆已达八百六十五座，加上原有七十二座各种类型的博物馆，共达九百三十七座，比去年增加十三倍，超过英国，跃居世界第三位。
    这些博物馆完全是社会主义的新型博物馆，它是为政治服务，为生产服务，是党推动中心工作的一种有力宣传鼓动工具，它的陈列内容主要的是反映各地在总路线照耀下，工农业生产的大跃进和群众的冲天干劲，以及今后的美好远景，推广技术革新经验，介绍先进生产经验和普及科学知识。它彻底粉碎了博物馆只能冷冷清清的搞古董的错误认识，也克服了博物馆只能“专家”办，不能群众办的错误思想。这是我国博物馆事业两条道路斗争的伟大胜利。
    群众对这种新型博物馆是极为欢迎的，黑龙江依兰县博物馆开放后，仅五天观众就达二万多人次。山东肥城县博物馆开馆后，群众赞扬说：“博物馆是一个指方向、学技术、表成绩、颂今世的重要场所”。还有用快板表达他们的心情：“看了博物馆，好像擦了眼，咱们努力干，社会主义就实现”。
    根据河南、安徽、江苏、山东、吉林等地建立博物馆的经验，主要是：（一）建馆的目的明确，紧密地结合党的中心工作，许多县博物馆都是在整风运动中、社会主义大辩论中、生产大跃进中建立起来的，他们以陈列的实物，有力地驳斥了右倾思想和观潮派，鼓舞群众的增产信心，为工农业生产大跃进服务；（二）党委亲自领导，与业务部门协作，贯彻群众路线。浙江嘉兴专区，由于党委重视，短短几个月，全区十二个县已全部建立了博物馆。江苏高淳县在建立博物馆工作中，县委十分重视，在各乡党委书记会议上布置博物馆工作，县委宣传部召开二次现场会议研究博物馆建馆工作；（三）破除迷信，敢想敢干。办博物馆并没什么“神秘”，县办博物馆工作中，既没“专家”，也没“艺术家”，模型、标本、沙盘和图表，全是群众自己动手，边干边学；（四）勤俭办馆，因陋就简，他们花钱少，用人少，不必新建馆，一般几十元或几百元就够了，江苏江宁县只用了十五元一角六分钱在三天半时间就建成了博物馆。
