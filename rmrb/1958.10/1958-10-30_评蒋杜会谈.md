    Shortly before, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles went to Taiwan to hold talks with Chiang Kai-shek. These days, the United States has been loudly proclaiming that this meeting marks a change in U.S. policy toward China, strengthens the solidarity between the U.S. and Chiang, and demonstrates U.S. peaceful intentions. The U.S. policy toward China has indeed changed, that is, to make its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" public. However, this change is only to promote the policy of aggression and war against China in another way, and there is no question of peaceful intentions at all. Dulles's purpose in this meeting was to force Chiang Kai-shek to accept the "two Chinas" plan. In this regard, he did gain some advantages, but far from achieving his wishes. As for the so-called strengthening of solidarity, that is completely self-deception.
    Imperialism always bullies the weak and fears the strong. In the face of the increasingly powerful Chinese people, the old U.S. methods of aggression against China are no longer feasible. In several serious contests with the Chinese people, the United States has suffered shameful defeats. Recently, U.S. military provocations and war threats against China in the Taiwan Strait region have further aroused the great indignation of the Chinese people. The 650 million Chinese people have launched a great movement to defend the motherland and oppose U.S. aggression, and are prepared to give the aggressors who dare to invade a head-on blow at any time. The Chinese people's just struggle has been supported by the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, many Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving countries and peoples. The world strongly condemns the U.S. playing with fire. Even among the allies of the United States, no one except Syngman Rhee and Nobusuke Kishi has publicly expressed willingness to help the United States as an accomplice. Within the United States, the general public widely opposes U.S. war provocations against China. This very unfavorable situation has forced the United States to change some tricks in its policy toward China. The U.S. Republican government is trying to use this change to ease the condemnation of world public opinion and the dissatisfaction of its allies, and to win votes for the Republican Party in the upcoming U.S. congressional elections.
    The United States has been plotting to create "two Chinas" for a long time. In the past, it mostly hid behind the scenes, planning and directing some countries that followed it to come forward and act. Now, it openly runs to the front stage to do it itself. On the eve of the publication of the Jiang-Dulles talks communique, U.S. Vice President Nixon bluntly said that "it is necessary to establish an independent Chinese government that can express the loyalty of 12 million Formosans and millions of overseas Chinese." In the Jiang-Dulles talks communique on October 23, Dulles forced the Taiwan authorities to accept the so-called principle of non-use of force, so that the Chiang Kai-shek group only has the right to represent "free China". This seems to be an agreement between Chiang and Dulles. In fact, as early as October 16, Dulles had already assigned Chiang Kai-shek to accept this U.S. decision in his conversation with a reporter from British Independent Television. And in this conversation, while Dulles conferred a small China on the Chiang Kai-shek group, he also said that he saw that Communist China did exist and was willing to deal with it. This is obviously openly creating "two Chinas."
    It must be pointed out that the U.S. creation of "two Chinas" is only a temporary measure. The United States wants to first separate Taiwan from China and completely isolate it in order to strengthen its control over the Chiang Kai-shek group and strengthen its occupation of Taiwan. But this is only the first step. Once Taiwan becomes a "de facto political entity" separated from China, the United States can use some kind of name to trusteed Taiwan. In this way, the United States will get dual benefits. First, it can legalize the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony. Second, it can drag some other countries into the water and share the responsibility for aggression for the United States. Obviously, in this conspiracy of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek group has no place. Nixon said that the U.S. goal in the Far East is to turn Taiwan into a "free island" instead of "linking U.S. policy with Chiang Kai-shek." Is the meaning of this sentence not clear enough?
    The United States' abuse of the principle of non-use of force in international relations to China's internal affairs is extremely absurd. The purpose of the United States in doing so is to bind the hands and feet of the Taiwan authorities and force them to completely submit to the United States. The Taiwan authorities are not unaware of this. Therefore, after the publication of the Jiang-Dulles talks communique, the Taiwan authorities desperately publicized that their announcement of non-use of force was conditional. However, the United States emphasized that the Taiwan authorities' announcement of non-use of force was a major victory for the United States. The two sides held different opinions and quarreled. In this case, Dulles said at a press conference on October 28, in a concluding tone, that no matter what reservations the Taiwan authorities made, their "hope of winning by force is not great." These words came from Dulles's mouth, isn't it intentionally making it impossible for the Taiwan authorities to survive?
    We have long said that the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" in order to permanently occupy Taiwan is absolutely impossible. The Chinese people who have stood up have the confidence to smash this conspiracy of the United States. There is only one China in the world, not "two Chinas." All patriotic Chinese oppose "two Chinas." The vast number of overseas Chinese oppose "two Chinas." Even the Taiwan authorities do not agree with "two Chinas." Chiang Kai-shek said on October 24: "Taiwan and the mainland belong to one body, flesh and blood, and share weal and woe." We believe that all Chinese people unite and unanimously resist foreign enemies, and the U.S. conspiracy to split China and create "two Chinas" will inevitably be completely defeated.
    The United States knows that it is impossible to directly propose "two Chinas." Therefore, it has adopted a cunning approach, such as proposing a ceasefire, abandoning the use of force, reducing the Chiang army on the coastal islands, and so on. However, all patriotic Chinese people will not allow the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs with this set of methods in order to achieve the purpose of creating "two Chinas."
    In order to promote its plan to create "two Chinas" in the world, the United States deliberately confuses the public. The United States says that since there can be two Koreas, two Vietnams, and two Germanys, why can't there be "two Chinas"? This is very absurd. The existence of two Germanys is the result of World War II. The division of Korea and Vietnam into two parts, north and south, is a temporary state stipulated in relevant international agreements. This situation is fundamentally incomparable to the U.S. occupation of Taiwan by force and hindering China's unification. The United States uses all means to try to hinder the unification of Germany, Korea, and Vietnam. Now, it wants to use the divided state of these three countries as the basis for its creation of "two Chinas" and its long-term occupation of Taiwan. This is not only completely untenable, but also sufficient to expose the U.S. crimes of aggression everywhere in the world.
    Faced with the firm opposition of the Chinese people, the United States is planning to achieve its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" through so-called international solutions. It attempts to submit the situation in the Taiwan Strait region to the United Nations. The United Nations should have intervened in the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region caused by U.S. aggression and interference in China. However, because the People's Republic of China's legitimate status in the United Nations has been deprived, the United Nations has lost its qualifications to deal with this issue. As for the internal affairs issue of the Chinese people liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and unifying the motherland, the United Nations has no right to interfere at all, and no self-respecting Chinese can agree to bring this issue to the United Nations. The United States also attempts to use other so-called international solutions such as international tribunals, referendums, and international mediation to interfere in China's internal affairs and hinder the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is also absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We believe that all justice-upholding countries and people will not fall into the U.S. trap.
    The United States clearly knows that the Chinese people will never allow the U.S. plan to create "two Chinas" to be realized under any circumstances, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and complete the sacred cause of unifying the motherland. However, the United States insists on splitting China and even attempts to force the Chinese people to accept "two Chinas" through military provocations and war threats. This will inevitably lead to the continuation and even further deterioration of the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region. Therefore, the key to eliminating the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region is that the United States must immediately stop its military provocations against China, abandon interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.
    Many people are worried that the U.S. war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region will cause a world war. This worry is understandable. There are indeed some war maniacs in the United States who want to provoke war in the Taiwan Strait or other parts of the world. We must be vigilant. However, U.S. imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The U.S.'s so-called policy of strength and policy of brinkmanship cannot scare the Chinese people. On the contrary, the U.S.'s saber-rattling and clamoring for war can only make itself more isolated in the world. Although U.S. aggressors are warlike by nature, they cannot but have some concerns about launching a war against a powerful China that is supported by the people of the world. The people of China and the world can once again see from the recent development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait region that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger. As long as the people of the world further unite and carry out a resolute struggle, the U.S. policy of aggression and war can be completely defeated.

### 评蒋杜会谈

    评蒋杜会谈
    不久以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯到台湾同蒋介石举行了会谈。这几天，美国大吹大擂地说，这次会谈标志着美国对华政策的改变，加强了美蒋之间的团结，表现了美国的和平意图。美国的对华政策确实有所改变，那就是把它制造“两个中国”的阴谋表面化。但是，这种改变不过是用另外一种方式来推行对中国的侵略政策和战争政策，根本谈不上什么和平意图。杜勒斯在这次会谈中的目的，是要强迫蒋介石接受“两个中国”的计划。在这方面，他的确占了一些便宜，但是，却远没有如愿以偿。至于所谓加强团结云云，那完全是自欺欺人之谈。
    帝国主义总是欺软怕硬，欺弱怕强的。在日益强大的中国人民面前，美国侵略中国的老办法，已经行不通了。在同中国人民的几次严重较量中，美国都遭到了可耻的失败。最近，美国在台湾海峡地区对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁，更加激起了中国人民的极大义愤。六亿五千万中国人民展开了保卫祖国、反对美国侵略的伟大运动，准备随时给敢于进犯的侵略者以迎头痛击。中国人民的正义斗争得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营、许多亚非国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。全世界都强烈谴责美国的玩火行为，甚至在美国的盟国中，除了李承晚和岸信介以外，也没有任何人公开表示愿意替美国帮凶。在美国国内，广大公众普遍反对美国对中国的战争挑衅。这种十分不妙的形势，迫使美国不得不在对华政策方面改变一些花样。美国共和党政府企图利用这种改变，来和缓世界舆论的谴责和它的盟国的不满，并且在即将到来的美国国会选举中为共和党骗取选票。
    美国制造“两个中国”，蓄谋已久。过去，它多半躲在幕后策划指挥一些追随它的国家出面活动。现在，它却明目张胆地跑到台前来亲自搞了。在蒋杜会谈公报发表的前夕，美国副总统尼克松就露骨地说，“有必要成立一个可以使一千二百万福摩萨人和成百万华侨表示忠心的独立中国政府”。在10月23日蒋杜会谈公报中，杜勒斯强迫台湾当局接受所谓不使用武力的原则，使蒋介石集团只有代表“自由中国”的权利。这好像是蒋杜双方的协议。其实，早在10月16日，杜勒斯在同英国独立电视公司记者的谈话中，就已经派定蒋介石接受美国这一决定。而在这篇谈话中，杜勒斯在把蒋介石集团封为一个小中国的同时，还说，他看到共产党中国确实存在，并且愿意同它打交道。这显然是在公开制造“两个中国”。
    必须指出，美国制造“两个中国”，只是一种权宜之计。美国是想首先使台湾脱离中国，完全孤立起来，以便于它加强对蒋介石集团的控制，加强对台湾的占领。但是，这只是第一步。一旦台湾成为一个脱离中国的“事实上存在的政治单位”，美国就可以利用某种名义来托管台湾了。这样，美国就会得到双重好处，一则可以使美国侵占台湾合法化，把台湾变成美国的殖民地，二则又可以拖一些别的国家下水，替美国分担侵略责任。很显然，在美国这个阴谋计划里，蒋介石集团是没有地位的。尼克松说，美国在远东的目的，是要把台湾变为一个
  “自由之岛”，而不是“把美国的政策同蒋介石连结起来”。这句话的意思难道还不明白吗？
    美国把在国际关系中不使用武力的原则滥用到中国内政问题上来，这本来是极其荒谬的。美国这样作的目的，是要束缚台湾当局的手脚，迫使他们完全屈从于美国。对于这一点，台湾当局也不是不了解的。因此，在蒋杜会谈公报发表后，台湾当局拼命宣传，他们宣布不使用武力是有保留条件的。可是，美国却强调，台湾当局宣布不使用武力是美国的重大胜利。双方各执一词，吵吵嚷嚷，闹成一片。在这种情况下，杜勒斯在10月28日的记者招待会上，用作结论的口吻，干脆地说，不论台湾当局作什么样的保留，他们“用武力来取胜的希望是不大的”。这些话竟出自杜勒斯之口，岂不是蓄意叫台湾当局混不下去吗？
    我们早已说过，美国制造“两个中国”，以便长期霸占台湾的阴谋，是绝对办不到的。站起来了的中国人民，有信心一定能够粉碎美国的这个阴谋。世界上只有一个中国，没有“两个中国”。一切爱国的中国人，都反对“两个中国”。广大的海外侨胞反对“两个中国”。就是台湾当局也不同意“两个中国”。蒋介石在10月24日还说：“台湾和大陆本属一体，骨肉相关，休戚与共。”我们相信，全体中国人团结起来，一致对外，美国分裂中国、制造“两个中国”的阴谋，必然会遭到彻底的失败。
    美国知道，直接提出“两个中国”来是行不通的。所以它采取了一套狡猾的办法，比如提出停火啊、放弃使用武力啊，减少沿海岛屿的蒋军啊，等等。但是，所有爱国的中国人都不容许美国用这一套办法插手中国内政，来实现制造“两个中国”的目的。
    美国为了在世界上推销它制造“两个中国”的计划，故意混淆视听。美国说，既然可以有两个朝鲜、两个越南、两个德国，为什么不能有“两个中国”呢？这是十分荒谬的。两个德国的存在是第二次世界大战的结果造成的。朝鲜和越南分成南北两个部分，是有关的国际协议规定的暂时状态。这种情况同美国用武力霸占台湾，阻挠中国的统一，是根本不能相比的。美国用尽一切手段，竭力阻挠德国、朝鲜和越南的统一，现在，又想把这三个国家的分裂状态作为它制造“两个中国”、长期霸占台湾的根据。这不仅是完全站不住脚的，而且适足以暴露美国在世界上到处进行侵略的罪行。
    面对着中国人民的坚决反对，美国正在策划以所谓的国际解决来实现它制造“两个中国”的阴谋。它企图把台湾海峡地区局势问题提交联合国。美国对中国进行侵略和干涉，引起台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，联合国本来是应该过问的。但是，由于中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位遭到剥夺，联合国已经失去了处理这个问题的资格。至于中国人民解放台、澎、金、马，统一祖国的内政问题，联合国根本无权过问，任何有自尊心的中国人也绝不能同意把这个问题提到联合国去。美国还企图利用什么国际法庭、公民投票、国际调解等其他的所谓国际解决方法，来干涉中国内政，阻挠中国人民解放台、澎、金、马，这也都是中国人民绝对不能容许的。我们相信，一切主持正义的国家和人士，都不会掉进美国的圈套。
    美国明明知道，中国人民在任何情况下，都决不容许美国制造“两个中国”的计划实现，中国人民一定要解放台湾，完成统一祖国的神圣事业。但是，美国硬要分裂中国，甚至企图用军事挑衅和战争威胁来强迫中国人民接受“两个中国”。这就势必会使台湾海峡地区的紧张局势继续下去，甚至进一步恶化。因此，消除台湾海峡地区紧张局势的关键，就是美国必须立即停止对中国的军事挑衅，放弃干涉中国内政，并且从台湾和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。
    有不少人担心美国在台湾海峡地区的战争挑衅会引起世界大战。这种担心是可以理解的。美国确有一些战争狂人，很想在台湾海峡或者世界其它地区挑起战争，我们必须保持警惕。但是，美帝国主义是色厉内荏、外强中干的。美国的什么实力政策，什么战争边缘政策，都是吓不倒中国人民的。相反地，美国剑拔弩张、叫嚣战争，只能使它自己在世界上更加孤立。尽管美国侵略者好战成性，但是，要对强大的和得到全世界人民支持的中国发动战争，美国侵略者却不能不有所顾虑。全中国和全世界的人民，都可以从最近台湾海峡地区局势的发展中再一次看到美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。只要世界人民进一步团结起来，进行坚决的斗争，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策是完全能够打败的。
