Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th. As the 41st anniversary of the great October Revolution approaches, Soviet agricultural workers are celebrating this year's unprecedented bumper harvest with boundless joy. Good news of fulfilling and overfulfilling the state grain sales plans is coming from all over.

Currently, the work of selling grain is in full swing. Agricultural workers in various places have enthusiastically launched competitions to strive for outstanding achievements in grain sales as a gift to the October Revolution anniversary and the 21st Congress of the CPSU. So far, six republics across the Soviet Union have completed their grain sales plans. Ukrainian agricultural workers recently sold 550 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain to the state, exceeding the sales plan by 100 million poods, which is 112 million poods more than last year, and the sales are still continuing. Many regions have greatly overfulfilled their grain sales plans. The Don region originally planned to sell 87 million poods of grain to the state, but now it has already sold more than 130 million poods. The Saratov Oblast has completed twice the original grain sales plan.

Although the harvesting work in various places has not yet been completed, an unprecedented bumper harvest is a certainty. Grain output will greatly exceed the bumper year of 1956. The sugar beet harvest is unprecedented, having already reached the 1960 output target. The corn harvest is also historically rare. Vegetables have also had a bumper harvest.

This year's bumper harvest in Soviet agriculture is the result of the active implementation of a series of major measures by the CPSU Central Committee, such as the reorganization of machine tractor stations. Recently published materials show that three-quarters of the tractors and 60% of the harvesting combines in the Soviet Union's machine tractor stations have been transferred to collective farms. Collective farms now complete 65% of the mechanical work themselves. Machines are better utilized after being transferred to collective farms.

The new state regulations on the purchase prices of agricultural products have increased the income of many collective farms from selling agricultural products by two to three times compared to last year, and the public accumulation funds have also increased accordingly. (Attached picture)

    迎接十月革命节　喜庆空前大丰收
    苏联农业劳动者踊跃交售粮食
    已有六个共和国完成交售计划　各地交售粮食大大增加
    新华社莫斯科29日电　在伟大的十月革命四十一周年快要来临的时候，苏联农业劳动者正以无限喜悦的心情庆贺今年农业空前大丰收。各地纷纷传来完成和超额完成向国家交售粮食的计划的喜讯。
    目前，交售粮食的工作正在热火朝天地进行。各地的农业劳动者热烈地展开了竞赛，争取在交售粮食方面以卓越的成绩作为对十月革命节和苏共第二十一次代表大会的献礼。到目前为止，全苏联已经有六个共和国完成了粮食交售计划。乌克兰的农业劳动者最近向国家交售了五亿五千万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）粮食，超过交售计划一亿普特，比去年多一亿一千二百万普特，而且交售还在继续中。许多地区都大大超额完成了粮食交售计划。顿河沿岸地区原定向国家交售八千七百万普特粮食，而现在就已经交售了一亿三千多万普特。萨拉托夫州已经完成了原定交售粮食计划的两倍。
    目前各地的收获工作虽然还未最后结束，但是空前的大丰收已成定局。粮食产量将大大超过丰收的1956年。甜菜的收获量史无前例，已经达到1960年的产量指标。玉蜀黍收获量也是历史上少有的。蔬菜也获得了丰收。
    今年苏联农业大丰收是由于各地积极贯彻了苏共中央关于改组机器拖拉机站等一系列重大措施的结果。最近公布的材料表明，苏联全国机器拖拉机站四分之三的拖拉机和60％的收获联合机已经转给集体农庄。集体农庄有65％的使用机械的工作已经由农庄自己来完成。机器转交给集体农庄后利用得比过去更好。
    国家新规定的农产品采购价格，使许多集体农庄交售农产品所得的收入增加到去年的两、三倍，公积金也相应增加。（附图片）
