    Grasp the Main Contradiction in Machine Tool Production
    Ai Ding, Director of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory
    The country needs 80,000 machine tools this year, not one less; however, the production cycle for machine tools is relatively long, collaborative relationships are numerous, and there are still problems with material supply. Under these circumstances, should we be stretch our hands out and ask for help, or overcome difficulties and rely on our own efforts? Should we rely on increasing labor intensity to complete tasks, or use improved technical methods to increase labor productivity? These issues are sharply presented to enterprise leaders. The situation is pressing, forcing everyone to find a way out, and that way out is to vigorously engage in the technical revolution.
    The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is no exception, and is in the midst of such a great leap forward. The annual production target for this year was set at 1,400 units in April, leaped to 3,100 units in June, and after the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call for "leap forward again" in mid-August, it rose again to 4,600 units, striving for 5,000 units. Thus, it is necessary to complete two-thirds of the annual task in four months. From this, it can be seen that more widely carrying out the technical revolution to rapidly increase labor productivity is even more urgent for the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory. This point is unanimously recognized throughout the factory.
    What methods should be adopted to carry out the technical revolution movement? Because the machine tool factory has better equipment and a higher technical level, and its products are mostly small-batch produced precision machine tools, there has always been a so-called "small-scale" versus "large-scale" debate in terms of methods. "Small-scale" means only generally focusing on improving tools, equipment, and operating methods to increase production efficiency; "large-scale" means not only improving tools, equipment, and operating methods, but also mobilizing the worker masses to modify and simplify unreasonable design structures and processing technology regulations. Some technicians advocate for "small-scale," believing that the machine tool factory's products are relatively advanced, and design drawings and process regulations have "international standards" as their basis. This aspect of reform is the business of technicians, and workers only see parts, not the whole picture, and do not understand design principles. For workers, drawings are "laws," and technical revolution can only use their brains outside the "legal" circle; the product structure cannot be violated. However, the workers disagree with "small-scale." They believe that machine tool structures are complex, processing techniques are unreasonable, resulting in huge waste of manpower and material resources in the production process, and there is a lot of "oil and water" in reforming this aspect, so they can engage in revolution on a large scale.
    The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed this debate and affirmed the adoption of "large-scale" methods. The Party Committee believes that the debate between "large-scale" and "small-scale" actually reflects the ideological difference of whether or not the technical revolution should rely on the worker masses, and whether or not to follow the mass line. The saying that workers do not understand design and cannot violate the product structure is completely wrong. The worker masses have long-term practical experience and rich production knowledge. They understand the performance of machines most thoroughly, feel the deepest, and understand the most specifically in their daily labor. They should be the masters of the product and the main force of the technical revolution. Due to the influence of the old society, workers do not master design, technology, and the resulting set of rules and regulations, and a set of organizational management forms that put the cart before the horse, such as departments controlling workshops, which still restrict their enthusiasm and creativity in many ways. At the same time, due to this upside-down approach, many shortcomings of intellectuals and technicians in design and process regulations, such as being out of touch with reality and formalism, cannot be fundamentally overcome.
    Fully mobilizing the worker masses to engage in design and technology, and simplifying machine tool structures and process regulations, is grasping the main contradiction in the machine tool industrial production. Therefore, the machine tool factory's technical revolution movement has changed from its past stagnant state and developed rapidly. Many shortcomings of the machine tool factory, such as complex product design institutions and unreasonable processing techniques, also reflect the contradiction between workers and intellectual technicians, and the contradiction between the masses and leaders. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to take the process of carrying out the technical revolution as a process of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and to continue to implement the spirit of rectification. The methods of presenting facts, reasoning, engaging in great debate, and making great rectification and great changes, created in the rectification movement, are fully applied to the technical revolution movement. In late August, the Party Committee organized more than 140 people, including Party committee members, responsible comrades from the factory, and major engineering and technical personnel from technical departments, to go down to the workshops to eat, live, and labor with the workers. The first step was to learn from the workers, first as students, then as teachers. Engineering and technical personnel reported to the workers on how the products were designed, and asked the workers to discuss and criticize; workers made suggestions and improvement opinions based on labor experience, and also asked technical personnel to discuss and help them realize them. In this way, a heated debate unfolded in technical work. For example, when the factory's engineering and technical personnel and workers were discussing whether more or fewer contact points were better when scraping and grinding the machine tool table, the engineering and technical personnel, based on the golden rules in books, insisted that there should be no less than thirteen contact points per square inch; the workers opposed this view, believing that six to eight points were enough. Each held their own opinion and would not yield to the other. Later, a worker brought up an incident in which the phenomenon of table crawling was eliminated by reducing the number of contact points, and the engineering and technical personnel, through recollection, willingly conceded in the face of facts. The more intense the debate between the two sides on each technical issue, the more enthusiastic the emotions, and the faster the problem was solved.
    The workers have been high-spirited since participating in production management. Now that they have also been given the technical power of product design, technology, etc., and the opinions are handled so quickly, they feel that they have truly become the masters of the product, and their fighting spirit is even higher. The leadership strongly supports the new creations of the staff, and the problems that were not solved in the rectification movement have been solved, and a rectification make-up lesson was conducted. Everyone deeply realized that Chairman Mao's theory on correctly handling contradictions among the people immediately generates tremendous material force once it is grasped by the masses. Under the education of actual struggle, the engineering and technical personnel truly realized the truth that "the lowliest are the most intelligent," and consciously showed their hearts in this movement, feeling that they had found the road to being both red and expert. Some people said: "From now on, we can no longer 'release black water' to the workers" (Note), which formed a new united relationship among leading cadres, production workers, and technical personnel. The workers called this relationship as close as "three-in-one soil."
    Because the main contradictions within the enterprise have been correctly handled after the target leap forward, more than 10,000 opinions have emerged in the technical revolution in half a month, not only excellently completing the August production target, but also greatly tapping potential forces. The factory did not increase production workers or equipment. The hours completed in August increased by 31% compared to July, and the hours completed in the last ten days were equivalent to 130% of the first and middle ten days.
    At present, the technical revolution movement in the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is still developing smoothly and deeply. The workers of the whole factory are determined to compress production hours in simplifying machine tool structures and processing techniques, and to ensure the completion of the annual production leap forward target. (Note: "Releasing black water" here is a metaphor for technicians using "technical theory" to scare workers, just like a squid releasing a cloud of black water to cover its escape when encountering an enemy.)

    抓住机床生产中的主要矛盾
    上海机床厂厂长  艾丁
    全国今年需要机床八万台，一台也不能少；而机床生产的周期比较长，协作关系比较多，材料供应还有问题。在这种情况下，是当伸手派、还是克服困难自力更生？是靠增强劳动强度去完成任务，还是用改进技术方法来提高劳动生产率？这些问题尖锐地摆在企业领导面前。形势逼人，逼得大家不得不去找出路，这条出路，就是大闹技术革命。
    上海机床厂也毫不例外地处于这样的跃进再跃进的高潮中。今年全年的生产指标4月份订一千四百台，6月份跃进到三千一百台，8月中旬，中共上海市委提出“跃进再跃进”的号召后，又上升到四千六百台，力争五千台。这样，就必须在四个月中完成全年任务的三分之二。由此可见，更广泛地开展技术革命来迅速提高劳动生产率对上海机床厂来说，具有更大的迫切性。这一点，全厂上下的认识是一致的。
    应该采取什么方法来开展技术革命运动呢？由于机床厂设备较好、技术水平较高，而产品大多是小批生产的精密机床，因此在方法上一向有所谓“小闹”与“大闹”之争。小闹，就是只能一般地从改进工具、设备、操作方法上着眼来提高生产效率；大闹，就是不仅要改进工具、设备、操作方法，也要发动工人群众来修改、简化不合理的设计结构和加工工艺规程。一部分技术人员主张小闹，他们认为机床厂产品比较高级，设计图纸和工艺规程有“国际标准”作为根据，这方面的改革，是技术人员的事，工人们只见零件，不见全局，不懂设计原理。对于工人来说，图纸就是“法律”，闹技术革命只能在“法律”圈子外面动点脑筋，产品结构不能侵犯。但工人们不同意小闹，他们认为机床结构复杂，加工工艺不合理，造成生产过程中人力物力巨大浪费，在这方面改革“油水”大，可以大闹革命。
    中共上海机床厂委员会分析了这场争论，肯定采取大闹的方法。党委会认为，大闹、小闹之争，实际上反映了技术革命要不要依靠工人群众，要不要走群众路线的思想分歧。所谓工人不懂设计、不能侵犯产品结构的说法是完全错误的。工人群众有着长期的实践经验与丰富的生产知识，他们在日常劳动中对机器的性能懂得最透，体会最深，了解最具体。他们应该是产品的主人，是技术革命的主力军。由于旧社会遗留的影响，现在工人不掌握设计、工艺以及由此产生的一套规章制度，一套科室支配车间等本末倒置的组织管理形式，目前在很多方面仍然限制了他们的积极性和创造性。同时也由于这套本末倒置的作法，使得知识分子技术人员在设计和工艺规程方面许多脱离实际、形式主义等等弊端，不能从根本上克服。
    充分发动工人群众大搞设计和工艺，简化机床结构和工艺规程，也就是抓住了机床工业生产中的主要矛盾。因此机床厂的技术革命运动一变过去停滞不前的状况，突飞猛进地开展起来。机床厂所存在的产品设计机构复杂、加工工艺不合理的许多缺点，也反映着工人与知识分子技术人员间的矛盾，群众与领导间的矛盾。因此，党委会决定把开展技术革命的过程，作为正确处理人民内部矛盾的过程，整风精神继续贯彻的过程。把整风运动中创造出的摆事实、讲道理、大争大辩、大整大改的方法，完全运用到技术革命运动中来。党委会在8月下旬组织了党委委员、厂部负责同志、技术科室的主要工程技术人员等一百四十多人下到车间，与工人同吃同住同劳动。首先是向工人学习，先当学生，后当先生。工程技术人员把产品如何设计的向工人做报告，请工人来讨论批评；工人根据劳动经验提出建议和改进意见，也请技术人员来讨论，帮助其实现。这样在技术工作中展开了热烈的争论。例如这个厂的工程技术人员和工人在讨论机床台面刮、研接触点多好还是少好的问题时，工程技术人员根据书本上的金科玉律，主张每个平方英寸不能少于十三个接触点；工人反对这种说法，认为只要六点到八点。各执一词，互不相下。后来工人提出一件将接触点由多改少消灭了台面爬行现象的往事，工程技术人员通过回忆，在事实面前心甘情愿地服输了。每一个技术问题双方争论越激烈，情绪越饱满，解决得越快。
    工人们自从参加了生产管理以后，已经是意气风发。现在又把产品设计、工艺等技术大权交给了他们，处理意见又这样迅速，感到自己真正做了产品的主人，斗志更加昂扬。领导方面大力支持职工新的创造，整风运动中没有解决的问题都获得解决，进行了一次整风补课。大家都深深地体会到毛主席的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说，一旦为群众所掌握，就立即发生巨大的物质力量。工程技术人员在实际斗争的教育下，真正认识到“卑贱者最聪明”的道理，在这个运动中自觉地交心，感到这才找到了又红又专的道路。有的人表示：“从此再不能向工人‘放黑水’了”（注），这就形成了领导干部、生产工人、技术人员三结合的新的团结关系。工人称这样的关系像“三合土”一样的紧密。
    由于指标跃进以后企业内部的主要矛盾得到了正确的处理，所以在半个月的时间内在技术革命方面涌出了一万条以上的意见，不仅出色地完成了8月份生产指标，并且大大挖掘了潜在力量。全厂没有增加生产工人和设备，8月份完成工时比7月份增加31％，下旬完成的工时，相等于上中两旬的130％。
    目前上海机床厂的技术革命运动还在顺利地深入开展，全厂工人决心在简化机床结构和加工工艺等方面，压缩生产工时，保证完成全年生产跃进指标。（注：“放黑水”，此处比喻技术人员用“技术理论”吓唬工人，好似乌贼鱼遇到敌人时放出一团黑水掩护自己逃跑。）
