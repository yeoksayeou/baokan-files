Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th: Indonesian Information Minister Sudibyo told the press on the 14th that the Indonesian government will continue to implement its established policy of restoring security and will not negotiate with the so-called "Revolutionary Government" rebel group in Sumatra, the "Universal Struggle Charter" rebel group, or the "Islamic Army" terrorist group.

Sudibyo, in his capacity as a government spokesman, expressed the government's attitude towards the resolution on security issues passed by the West Java Muslim Scholars Conference. The West Java Muslim Scholars Conference, recently held in Bandung, passed a resolution requesting the government to reconsider its policy on restoring security and suggesting that "security issues be resolved through consultation."

Sudibyo said that for rebels and "Islamic Army" terrorists, there is only one path: unconditional surrender to the government.

He pointed out that the government had conducted sufficient consultations in the past. However, the elements now engaged in rebellion took advantage of this opportunity to consolidate their strength and oppose the legitimate government with various absurd excuses.

Prior to this, on the evening of the 13th, Indonesian Army spokesman Hasono also issued a statement on the matter, saying that there would be no compromise or negotiation with rebels anywhere in the country, and that it was impossible to take any measures other than resolute action against the rebels in accordance with the government's security policy.

    印度尼西亚政府决心平乱
    情报部长表示不同叛乱分子协商
    新华社雅加达15日电　印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约14日向报界表示，印度尼西亚政府将继续执行既定的恢复治安的政策，不会同在苏门答腊的所谓“革命政府”叛乱集团以及“全面斗争约章”叛乱集团和“伊斯兰教军”恐怖集团等进行协商。
    苏迪比约是以政府发言人的身份，对西爪哇穆斯林学者大会通过的关于治安问题的决议表示政府的态度。最近在万隆举行的西爪哇穆斯林学者大会通过了一项决议，要求政府重新考虑关于恢复治安的政策，并且建议“通过协商来解决治安问题”。
    苏迪比约说，对叛乱分子和“伊斯兰教军”恐怖分子来说，只有一条路，那就是无条件地向政府投降。
    他指出，政府在过去进行了充分的协商。但是，现在在进行叛乱活动的分子在那个时候利用了这个机会来巩固他们的力量，并且用各种荒谬的借口来反对合法政府。
    在这以前，印度尼西亚陆军发言人哈索诺在13日晚上也就这件事发表声明说，不会同国内任何地方的叛乱分子妥协或进行谈判，对于叛乱分子，除了根据政府的安全政策采取坚决的措施以外，采取别的办法是不可能的。
