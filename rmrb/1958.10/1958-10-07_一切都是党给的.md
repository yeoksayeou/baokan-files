Everything is Given by the Party
Students of Tsinghua University, Huang Meilai, Zhou Yinghu

This March, we, the third-year students of the Automobile and Tractor major, began to repair cars under the guidance of workers. In the past five months, we have repaired 42 cars of more than 30 different brands, and also assembled two trucks with old parts. In this labor, we have gained a lot of production knowledge that is not available in books. How wonderful it would be to write a book about this knowledge and experience! By writing a book, we can systematize and elevate the experience and knowledge that each of us has gained to a theoretical level. It can also be used to popularize automobile repair technology, as every commune in the countryside will establish automobile repair factories, and they need technical knowledge in this area. After the General Party Branch of the Power Department learned of our ideas, they immediately supported us, and the teachers and master workers who led us in repairing cars also expressed their willingness to give us concrete help.

However, some students believe that writing books is a matter for experts and professors, and they dare not do it themselves. Some teachers also said, "Isn't it too early for you to write a book now?" We launched a discussion among all the students. Most students believe that we are all young people with some cultural and technical theoretical knowledge. Since we can repair a large number of cars under the leadership of workers, we can also write a book on automobile repair science under the leadership of the Party and with the help of workers. Some students also quoted Chairman Mao's words in "On Practice" that theory comes from practice. Now that we have a period of practical perceptual knowledge, if we do not systematize it and raise it to rational knowledge, then our labor gains will not be complete. After such a discussion, everyone's enthusiasm came. Groups posted big-character posters one after another, determined to write the book in two days and two nights.

We organized a writing team according to the structure of the car and advanced separately. Some invited workers to first formulate a writing outline, and some asked workers to explain the problems they had not understood. The workshop and next to the cars were all students busy writing. After the students wrote the first draft, they asked the workers to review it. After the revision, it was taken to a defense conference composed of teachers, workers, and students for section-by-section approval. We are determined to make this book use all Chinese nouns, so that people with junior high school education can understand it at a glance, and adapt to the current rural needs of only being able to repair with manual tools. For example, the first draft written by the braking group was too simple and abstract, making it difficult for people to understand. The workers did not pass it during the review. The students were not discouraged. According to the workers' opinions, they recalled every specific problem encountered in the labor and rewrote it again. The more they wrote, the clearer it became, and the faster they wrote. Later, we also found that using illustrations to represent operations and attaching short explanations was clearer than long narratives, so we drew a large number of illustrations in the book. We experienced in our labor that safety is the most important thing in production, followed by tools and the methods of using them. Therefore, the book also provides very specific explanations and introductions to these two issues. In addition, we also wrote about some of the tools and operating methods we created in the process of repairing cars. For example, the work of loading and unloading gearboxes generally requires a crane to operate, but we used a few pieces of old iron material to make a frame to replace the crane, which is convenient and saves money.

We worked day and night. When we were tired, we lay down on the car sofa for a while. On the morning of the third day, a "Automobile Repair Science" of more than 50,000 words was published. We have won again, and taken down the "only experts and professors can write books" trump card in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. At the same time, it also refuted the absurd argument held by those who oppose the combination of education and productive labor that "practice can only cause quantitative change and cannot cause qualitative change, and qualitative change is caused by the genius theory of scientists."

Through this book-writing activity, we have gained a deeper understanding of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Some of us used to doubt that the Party's education policy would reduce the quality of teaching. Now these doubting students say: We have no expert guidance, repaired cars and built trucks under the leadership of workers, and now we have written a book. We can no longer think of any other better standard to explain our excellent learning quality. One student said that in the past he always thought that the Party only gave students politics, and old experts gave them knowledge. Today, the facts tell him that everything is given by the Party.

    一切都是党给的
    清华大学学生　黄美来　周应虎
    我们汽车拖拉机专业三年级的学生，今年3月间开始在工人的带领下从事了修理汽车的劳动，五个月来共修了三十多种不同牌号的汽车四十二辆，还用旧零件装配了两辆卡车。在这项劳动中我们获得了许多书本上没有的生产知识，把这些知识和经验写成一部书该有多好啊！通过写书可以把我们每个人所得到的经验和知识加以系统并提高到理论上来，又可以用它来普及汽车修理技术，现在农村每个公社都要成立汽车修理厂，也正需要这方面的技术知识。动力系党总支知道了我们的想法后，立即支持我们干，带领我们修汽车的老师傅也表示愿意给我们以具体的帮助。
    可是，有些同学认为写书是专家教授们的事，自己不敢干。有些教师也说：“你们现在就写书，未免为时过早。”我们在全体同学中间展开了讨论。多数同学认为我们都是有些文化和技术理论知识的青年，既然能在工人的带领下把大批汽车修好了，也就能在党的领导和工人的帮助下把汽车修理学一书写出来。有的同学还引用毛主席在实践论中的话说理论来源于实践，我们现在既然有了一段实践的感性知识，如果不把它加以系统提高成理性知识，那么我们的劳动收获也就不完整。这样一讨论，大伙儿的情绪都来了。各组纷纷贴大字报，决心两天两夜把书写出来。
    我们按照汽车的构造组织了个写作小组分头齐进。有的邀工人一起先订出了写作大纲，有的把自己没弄清楚的问题请工人讲解。车间里、汽车旁都是忙于写作的同学。同学们写好初稿就请工人审查，修改后再拿到教师、工人、学生组成的答辩大会上逐节通过，我们决心要使这本书全用中国名词，使具有初中文化的人一看就懂，而且适应目前农村只能以手工工具进行修理的需要。如制动小组第一次写成的初稿过于简单抽象使人不易看懂。工人们审查时就没有通过。同学们并没有灰心，根据工人的意见，回忆了劳动中所碰到的每一项具体问题，重新写了一遍。越写越明确，越写也越快了。后来我们还发现用插图表示操作，附上简短的说明，比长篇的叙述更清楚，于是我们就在书中画了大量的插图。我们在劳动中体验到安全在生产上是头等重要的事，其次是工具和工具的使用方法。因此书中也对这两个问题作了很具体的说明介绍。另外我们把自己在修车过程中创造出的一些工具和操作方法也写在里面了。如装卸变速箱的工作，一般都要用起重机才能操作，而我们用几块旧铁料制成一个架子代替了起重机，操作方便又省钱。
    我们不分日夜的干，累了就在汽车的沙发上躺一会，到第三天上午，一部五万多字的“汽车修理学”就问世了。我们又胜利了，拿下了资产阶级知识分子手中的“只有专家教授才能写书”的王牌。同时也驳倒了反对教育与生产劳动相结合的人所持的“实践只能引起量变不能引起质变，质变是科学家的天才理论引起的”荒谬论点。
  通过这次写书活动，我们对党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针也有了更进一步的体会。我们之中有些同学过去曾怀疑党的教育方针会降低教学质量。现在这些怀疑的同学说：我们没有专家指导，在工人的带领下修了车、造了卡车，现在又写了书，再也想不出有其他更好的标准来说明自己的优等学习质量了。有一位同学说，过去他总认为党只给学生们以政治、旧专家才给他们知识，今天事实告诉了他，一切都是党给的。
