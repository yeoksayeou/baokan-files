Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 18th: Vietnamese Minister of Industry, Le Thanh Nghi, published an article in today's "People's Daily" titled "The Main Experiences of China's Socialist Construction Upsurge," stating that the general line for socialist construction proposed by the Chinese Communist Party completely conforms to China's actual situation and the aspirations of 600 million people.

The article, after detailing the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, said that the time for China to catch up with and surpass Britain may be greatly shortened compared to the original estimate.

The article said that China's rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, as well as the creation of a new spirit of "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do" among the broad masses of cadres and people, laid the political and ideological foundation for the Great Leap Forward. Boldly mobilizing the masses by using the form of big-character posters, and carrying out mass-based, frank criticism and self-criticism, is a noble socialist style.

The article said that due to learning from the spirit of China's Great Leap Forward, many positive changes have recently emerged in Vietnamese rural areas and enterprises. The article called on the Vietnamese people to have confidence and determination to vigorously advance production and economic construction.

    越南工业部长发表文章说
    全民树立新风气是大跃进的基础
    新华社河内18日电　越南工业部部长黎清毅今天在“人民报”上以“中国社会主义建设高潮的主要经验”为题发表文章说，中国共产党提出的社会主义建设总路线完全符合中国的实际情况和六亿人民的愿望。
    文章在详细地叙述了1958年中国工农业大跃进的成就以后说，中国赶上和超过英国的时间可能比预定时间大大缩短。
    文章说，中国的整风运动和反右派斗争以及在广大干部和群众中造成“敢想、敢说、敢做”的新风气，为大跃进打下了政治思想基础。采用大字报的形式放手发动群众，开展群众性的坦率的批评和自我批评，这是一种高尚的社会主义风格。
    文章说，由于学习中国大跃进的精神；越南农村和企业中新近出现不少良好的转变。文章号召越南人民要有信心和决心，把生产和经济建设大力向前推进。
