The Coal Giant Dragon Soars
——An Introduction to the Coal Pavilion at the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition
By Our Correspondent Luo Xuan

　　Exceeding Britain Next Year
　　As soon as we entered the Coal Pavilion, our attention was immediately drawn to a crimson diagram behind the miner's statue. On the diagram was painted a soaring golden dragon, symbolizing the rapid advancement of China's coal industry. The two lines of striking comparative figures below the dragon indicate that China's coal production surpassing Britain is already an imminent reality.
　　In 1949, the year of national liberation, China's coal production was only 31 million tons, only one-seventh of Britain's coal production at that time. However, in just nine years, China's coal production has approached Britain's projected production for this year. This year, China's coal production is expected to reach 210 million tons, only 10 million tons less than Britain's projected production for this year. And according to the coal mine development plan announced by the British National Coal Board, Britain will only have 230 million tons by 1960. This means that the task of catching up with or surpassing Britain in fifteen years, put forward by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, can be accomplished in less than two years in the coal sector.
　　After visiting the Coal Pavilion, everyone will be excited about the high-speed development of China's coal industry. In the old China, from the establishment of the first modern mine in the Kaiping Basin in 1878 to 1948, only 1.2 billion tons of coal were produced in seventy years. However, in just this year alone, coal production in the new China has surged from 130 million tons last year to 210 million tons, equivalent to one-fifth of the total coal production in the old China over seventy years.

　　Coal Industry Enters a New Era
　　Currently, this giant dragon is galloping forward with a new fighting posture. A magnificent technical revolution movement has been launched in large and small coal mines across the country, rapidly changing the production landscape of China's coal mines.
　　Here, the most advanced coal mining technology in the world—hydraulic mining—should be mentioned first. It is the main direction of the technical revolution in the coal industry and a milestone marking China's coal industry entering a new era. I carefully observed the hydraulic mining model displayed in the exhibition hall. Unlike ordinary mechanized mines with their large and complex coal cutting, transporting, and hoisting machinery, this type of mine does not have towering pit props on the work surface. Workers stand in spacious roadways and operate water cannons. The large pieces of coal that are blasted down will cascade into the coal chutes with the water flow, and finally be crushed and pumped to the surface.
　　According to an engineer, this type of hydraulic mining is not only highly efficient and low in cost, but the air underground is also very fresh, which can fundamentally eliminate gas and coal dust explosions, roof collapses, and transportation accidents. Workers have compiled the ten major benefits of hydraulic mining into a rhyme, singing it everywhere. Due to the enthusiastic support of the workers and the broad masses, some technical problems that were considered difficult in the past were quickly resolved during the construction of hydraulic mining. I saw from the exhibition that the workers of the Kailuan Coal Science Research Institute succeeded in trial-manufacturing the world-significant coal-water pump with a head of 300 meters in just seven days and nights. Workers from Fushun, Jiawang, Kailuan, and other coal mines used wood and bamboo to replace iron for coal chutes and made their own water cannons. In July and August alone, more than 100 hydraulic mining workfaces were put into production across the country, and there were three fully hydraulic mines. According to the commentator, this number has exceeded the promotion plan formulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry at the beginning of this year by more than three times.
　　Next to the hydraulic mining model, there is a model of an even newer cutting-edge technology than hydraulic mining – underground coal gasification. It does not require digging mines to extract coal gas from underground. During the preparation of the exhibition, it was only displayed as an ideal vision for the coal industry, but one or two days before the opening of the exhibition, news of successful trials came from the Liaoyuan, Jiaohe, and Datong mines.
　　The various models of small mines and coal mining tools displayed at the exhibition were selected from the technical innovation movement in several small coal mines. They reflect the infinite wisdom of the masses. For example, many small coal mines in Sichuan Province lack electricity, so they try to use the underground water in the mines to generate electricity. At present, the steel industry needs a large amount of coking coal, and the simple coal washing trough created by the employees of the Jiangbei Coal Mine in Sichuan can wash at least 140 tons of clean coal per person per shift.

　　A Hundred Flowers Bloom on the Leaping Progress Platform
　　During the preparation of the exhibition, many models and charts could be revised and revised again with the rapid changes in the coal industry. However, how to reflect the situation of this great leap forward, which is changing rapidly, after the opening? This was the most troublesome problem for the exhibition staff. Later, people came up with a good idea: adding a leap forward platform to the exhibition. At present, this leap forward platform is already filled with good news from all over the country. They are like a hundred blooming flowers, competing with each other. Here is the good news from the Lieshan Coal Mine in Anhui Province that they successfully used the most advanced construction method of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge – the pipe column method – to sink wells; news from the Fushun Coal Science Research Institute that they began to use atomic isotopes to observe the ratio of coal and water in hydraulic mining pipelines; and also the good news from Jingxi, Hegang, and other coal mines that the horseshoe-shaped hydraulic lifting test was successful...
　　Now, the production good news from coal mines all over the country continues to come. A commentator told me that they are already worried that this leap forward platform will not be enough. (Attached picture)

    煤炭巨龙在飞腾
    ——全国工业交通展览会煤炭馆介绍
    本报记者　罗漩
      明年超过英国
    当我们一踏进煤炭馆，视线立刻被矿工塑像后面的一幅朱红色图板所吸住。图板上画着一条飞腾的金色巨龙，象征着我国煤炭工业正在突飞猛进。巨龙下面的两行鲜明的对比数字表明：我国煤炭产量超过英国已是摆在眼前的事实了。
    在1949年全国解放那年，我国的煤炭产量还不过三千一百万吨，只及英国当时煤炭产量的七分之一；然而不过九年，我国的煤产量已接近英国今年的预计产量。今年我国的煤产量预计可达到二亿一千万吨，只比英国今年的预计产量少一千万吨。而英国根据他们国家煤矿总局公布的煤矿开发方案，到1960年也只有二万三千万吨。这就是说，中共八大二次会议提出的十五年赶上或超过英国的任务，在煤炭方面不到两年就可完成。
    参观了煤炭馆，谁都会为我国煤炭工业的高速度发展而兴奋。旧中国从1878年在开平盆地建立第一对现代矿井起，到1948年七十年间也不过生产了十二亿吨煤炭。但是新中国只在今年一年间，煤炭产量就从去年的一亿三千万吨猛增到二亿一千万吨，等于旧中国七十年煤炭总产量的五分之一。
  煤炭工业进入新时代
    目前，这条巨龙正以新的战斗姿态奔腾前进。一个波澜壮阔的技术革命运动已在全国大小煤矿中展开，风驰电掣般地改变着我国煤矿的生产面貌。
    这里首先应该提到的是世界上最先进的采煤技术——水力采煤，它是煤炭工业技术革命的主要方向，也是标志着我国煤炭工业进入新时代的里程碑。我仔细地观看了陈列在展览馆里的水力化矿井模型。这种矿井不像普通机械化矿井那样有着庞大而复杂的割煤、运煤和提升机械，工作面上也没有林立的坑木。工人站在宽敞的巷道里操纵着水枪，被冲击下来的大块的煤就会随着水流倾泻进输煤溜槽，最后经破碎后再用水泵提升到地面。
    据一位工程师说，这种水力采煤矿井不但效率高、成本低，井下的空气也很清鲜，可以从根本上消灭瓦斯、煤尘爆炸、冒顶、运输事故。工人们把水力采煤的十大好处编成顺口溜，到处歌唱。由于工人和广大群众的热烈支持，在建设水力采煤矿井过程中，一些过去认为困难的技术问题，很快地得到解决，我从展览会上看到：开滦煤炭科学研究院的工人只用了七昼夜就试制成功了具有世界意义的扬程三百公尺的煤水泵；抚顺、贾汪、开滦等煤矿的工人用木材和竹材代替铁做输煤溜槽，自己制造水枪。仅在7、8两个月，全国投入生产的采煤工作面就有一百多个，全部水利化的矿井有三对。据讲解员说，这个数字已超过煤炭工业部今年年初制定的推广计划三倍以上。
    在水力采煤矿井模型旁边，有一项比水力采煤更新的尖端技术的模型——煤的地下气化。它不用开挖矿井，就能把煤气从地下抽出来。在展览会筹备期间，还只是当作煤炭工业的理想远景展出的，但是在展览会开幕前的一两天，就从辽源、蛟河、大同三矿传来了试验成功的捷报。
    展览会上陈列的多种多样的小型矿井的模型和采煤工具，是从几个小煤矿的技术革新运动中选择出来的。它们反映了群众无穷的智慧。如四川省许多小煤矿缺乏电力，他们就设法利用矿井里的地下水发电。目前钢铁工业需要大量炼焦精煤，四川江北煤矿职工创造的简易洗煤槽，每人每班至少可以洗出一百四十吨精煤。
    跃进台上百花争艳
  在展览会筹备期间，许多模型和图表还可以随着煤炭工业日新月异的变化一改再改。但是在开幕以后，怎样来反映这个一日千里的大跃进形势呢？这是展览会工作的人员感到最伤脑筋的问题。后来，人们想出了一个好办法：在展览会上增辟了一个跃进台。目前，这个跃进台上已经贴满了来自各地的捷报。它们像怒放的百花，在那里互相争艳。这里有安徽烈山煤矿试用武汉长江大桥最先进的施工法——管柱法打井成功的喜讯；有抚顺煤炭科学研究院开始用原子能同位素观测水力采煤管道中的煤水比例的消息；还有京西、鹤岗等煤矿试验马蹄形水力提升成功的佳音……。
    现在，各地煤矿的生产捷报还在不断传来。一位讲解员对我说，他们已在担心这个跃进台会不够用了。（附图片）
