    Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: White, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on the 17th that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles would arrive in Taipei around next Wednesday to confer with Chiang Kai-shek. White also confirmed that Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, would also arrive in Taipei at the same time and confer with Chiang Kai-shek along with Dulles.
    The State Department's announcement stated that Dulles was visiting Taipei to "consult" with Chiang Kai-shek at the "invitation" of the Chiang Kai-shek government, in accordance with Article 4 of the U.S.-Chiang treaty. However, according to Agence France-Presse, "unofficial Kuomintang sources" in Taipei hinted that the Chiang Kai-shek clique "issued this 'invitation' primarily due to the insistence of the U.S. State Department, rather than on the initiative of the Kuomintang side." The report also stated that the State Department's announcement would normally have been "warmly welcomed" in Taipei, but now Chiang Kai-shek elements in Taipei have "mixed feelings" upon hearing this news.
    Reports from Western news agencies indicate that Dulles' trip, following recent successive "visits" to Taiwan by senior U.S. military leaders, is to plot new political swindles.
    Many reports indicate that Dulles's trip is related to the U.S. Congressional elections to be held in early November.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Washington report: Following U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy's recent activities in Taiwan, Washington has also reported that U.S. Army Chief of Staff Taylor has already departed for activities in the Far East and will arrive in Taiwan at the end of this month to confer with the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The report states that the talks are "related to enhancing Taiwan and the coastal islands' 'military defense capabilities and modernizing these forces.'"

    杜勒斯又策划新政治骗局
    将去台湾和蒋介石会谈
    新华社18日讯　美国国务院发言人怀特17日说，美国国务卿杜勒斯将在下星期三左右到达台北同蒋介石举行会谈。怀特还证实，美国国务院远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊也将在同一时间到达台北和杜勒斯一起同蒋介石会谈。
    国务院的公告说，杜勒斯是应蒋介石政府的“邀请”，根据美蒋条约第四条到台北同蒋介石“进行磋商”的。但是，据法新社引台北的“国民党非官方人士”暗示，蒋介石集团“发出这次‘邀请’主要是由于美国国务院的坚持，而不是国民党方面的主动”。消息又说，国务院的公告在通常情况下在台北本来是会受到“热烈欢迎的”，但是现在台北蒋介石分子在听到这个消息的时候“心情却是混杂的”。
    西方通讯社的报道表明，在美国高级军事首领最近接连“访问”台湾以后，杜勒斯此行是为了策划新的政治骗局。
    许多消息指出，杜勒斯此行同11月初就要举行的美国国会选举有关。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊刚刚结束了在台湾的活动之后，华盛顿又传出消息说，美国陆军参谋长泰勒已经动身前来远东活动，并且将在本月底到台湾同蒋介石集团的首脑们举行会谈。消息说，这次会谈是同增强台湾和沿海岛屿的“军事防御力量以及使这些力量现代化有关”。
