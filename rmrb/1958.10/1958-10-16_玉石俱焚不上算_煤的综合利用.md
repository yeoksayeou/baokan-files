    It's Not Worth Destroying Jade and Stone Together
    ——Comprehensive Utilization of Coal
    Wang Zhenyuan
    People often use thick black smoke billowing from chimneys to describe the vigorous production of factories. In fact, from a scientific point of view, these wisps of black smoke are losing countless valuable industrial raw materials and causing a lot of waste.
    If coal is properly treated before direct combustion, not only can many valuable industrial raw materials be obtained, but it will not affect the subsequent generation of heat energy. What's the secret? It's simple. Coal is not just simple carbon, but a very complex organic compound. In addition to carbon, it also contains elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. When we use coal for direct combustion for heating, cooking, and power generation, carbon dioxide and water are produced, and some valuable organic and inorganic substances are destroyed. Even if some are not destroyed, they escape with the black smoke. To use an idiom, it's like "destroying jade and stone together," which is not worthwhile.
    If proper chemical treatment is applied to coal before direct combustion, both jade and stone can be preserved. This treatment is also called comprehensive utilization of coal.
    Heating coal in an air-isolated high-temperature (600°C) dry distillation process will produce a large amount of coal gas and coal tar. Coal gas is an ideal fuel for civilian use. Coal tar can be refined into substances such as benzene, toluene, phenol, naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, and fluorene. These are essential basic raw materials for important industries such as synthetic fibers, rubber, plastics, dyes, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, and explosives. The residue of coal tar after refining is asphalt, which can be used to pave asphalt roads.
    The solid product of coal dry distillation is called semi-coke. Semi-coke is an ideal fuel that can be used for power generation in power stations or for cooking. If semi-coke is treated with steam at high temperatures, water gas can be obtained. The main components of water gas are carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Not only can it be used as fuel, but it can also be used with metal as a catalyst at appropriate temperatures and pressures to generate gasoline, diesel, and other important organic chemical industry raw materials: such as alcohols, higher aldehydes, ketones, and alkenes. If semi-coke is mixed with air and steam, semi-water gas will be produced. Semi-water gas contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and a large amount of nitrogen. Carbon monoxide can be converted into hydrogen through proper treatment. By mixing appropriate proportions of nitrogen and hydrogen, ammonia can be generated under high temperature, high pressure, and with the help of a catalyst. Ammonia is the foundation of the nitrogen fertilizer industry, from which the most widely used chemical fertilizer—ammonium sulfate—can be manufactured.
    During the dry distillation of coal, ammonia gas and inorganic sulfides are also produced. These are also useful. The valuable rare element—germanium, the raw material for semiconductors—has already been extracted from ammonia.
    The best way to comprehensively utilize coal is to establish joint enterprises. Taking a coal dry distillation plant as the center, organic synthesis plants, gasification plants, thermal power stations, chemical fertilizer plants, steel plants, etc., are linked together. In this way, all the energy and industrial raw materials contained in coal can be fully utilized without wasting them.

    玉石俱焚不上算
    ——煤的综合利用
    王震元
    人们常用烟囱里冒着浓浓的黑烟来形容工厂生产的活跃。其实，从科学的观点来看，这一缕缕的黑烟里正不知跑掉了多少工业上有价值的原料，造成了不少浪费。
    如果把煤在直接燃烧以前加以适当的处理，不但可以得到很多有价值的工业原料，而且毫不影响以后的产生热能。这里面有什么秘密呢？说来很简单。煤并不是简单的碳，而是极复杂的有机化合物。除碳外，还含有氢、氮、氧、硫等元素。我们用煤来直接燃烧取暖，做饭和发电时，生成了二氧化碳和水，同时有些宝贵的有机和无机物质被破坏，有的虽然没有遭到破坏，也随着黑烟跑掉了。用一句成语来形容，叫作“玉石俱焚”，这未兔太不上算。
    如果在煤直接燃烧以前加以适当的化学处理，就能把玉石都保存下来。这种处理也叫做煤的综合利用。
    将煤放在隔绝空气的高温中（600°C）加热干馏，便会产生大量的煤气和煤焦油。煤气是民用的理想燃料。煤焦油可以提炼出苯、甲苯、苯酚、萘葸苊芴等物质。这些都是合成纤维、橡胶、塑料、染料、药物、香料、炸药等重要工业的基本原料。经过提炼后的煤焦油残渣，就是沥青。沥青可以铺柏油马路。
    煤干馏后的固体产物叫做半焦。半焦是很理想的燃料，可以供电站发电或者炊事用。假如将半焦在高温下用水蒸气处理，便可得到水煤气。水煤气的主要成分是一氧化碳和氢气，不但可以作燃料，还可在适当的温度和压力下用金属做触媒，生成汽油、柴油和其他重要的有机化学工业的原料：如醇类高级醛酮和烯类等。如果把半焦与空气和水蒸气混合作用，就会生成半水煤气。半水煤气里含有氢、一氧化碳和大量的氮气。将一氧化碳经过适当的处理即可变为氢气，混合适当比例的氮气和氢气，在高温高压和催化剂的作用下，就能生成氨气。氨是氮肥工业的基础，由此可制造应用最广的化学肥料——硫酸铵。
    在煤的干馏中，还会产生氨气和无机硫化物等。这些东西也都有用，目前在氨中已经提炼出了宝贵的稀有元素——半导体的原料锗
    综合利用煤的最好的办法是建立联合企业。以煤的干馏工厂为中心，把有机合成工厂、气化工厂、火电站、化学肥料厂，炼钢厂等联在一起。这样，在煤中所包含的一切能量和工业原料，就能够充分地被利用而不致浪费掉。
