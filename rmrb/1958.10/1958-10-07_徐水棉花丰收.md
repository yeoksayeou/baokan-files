    XuShui Cotton Harvest
    Ye Shengtao
    Gossypium herbaceum resembles hibiscus mutabilis, with thick stalks and large leaves forming a forest.
    The lower layer of bolls bursts forth with snow-white floss, the upper layer blooms with pink flowers,
    The middle layer's cotton peaches are full and about to split, heavy clusters adorn the plant several times over.
    Observers all marvel at the miracle, never before seen such cotton.
    Never before seen, is not a fixed state, now still in the growth period,
    Flowering and fruiting continue. Advanced commune members have confidence,
    The autumn harvest will definitely be astonishing, the yield of lint per mu will be several thousand jin!

    徐水棉花丰收
    叶圣陶
    草棉宛如木芙蓉，秆粗叶大成林丛。
    下层果绽吐雪絮，上层花开透粉红，
    中层棉桃饱欲裂，环株累累缀数重。
    观者皆叹见奇迹，如此棉花前未逢。
    前未逢，非定局，如今犹在生长期，
    开花结桃还相续。先进社员有信心，
    秋后收成定惊人，亩产皮棉数千斤！
