Xinhua News Agency, 24th. Coal miners and the broad masses across the country put forward the slogan "Fight for the Iron Marshal by Preparing Provisions," and in mid-October, they launched a sustained ten-day high-yield "satellite," with an average daily coal production exceeding one million tons, an increase of more than 200,000 tons compared to the average daily production in early October.

Due to the conscientious implementation of the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy in various regions, the mass movement of running coal mines by the whole people has been widely launched throughout the country. According to preliminary statistics, the average daily coal production from the tens of thousands of local coal kilns across the country during these ten days increased by more than 70% compared to the average daily production in September. In Guangxi's Xincheng County, a widespread mass mobilization, airing of views, and debates were conducted among the people of the county to stockpile provisions for the steel industry. The entire county launched a large-scale competition, led personally by the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, organizing a 70,000-strong steel and coal mining field army, setting off a vigorous upsurge in coal mining, producing more than 670,000 tons of coal on the 14th. Yizhang in Hunan, Linru, Yuxian, Shanxian, Xichuan, and Boai in Henan, and Chongyang in Hubei have also continuously launched "satellites" with a daily coal production of over 100,000 tons. These small coal kilns are easy to build and can quickly bloom everywhere, effectively meeting the fuel needs of scattered indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces.

The large-scale coal mining enterprises originally under the Ministry of Coal Industry achieved an average daily production of more than 590,000 tons during these ten days, an increase of 80,000 tons compared to the average daily production in September. Relevant departments believe that it is beneficial for large coal mines to vigorously increase coal production while simultaneously engaging in on-site coking. This not only reduces coal storage in the mining area and facilitates increased coal production but also alleviates transportation pressure.

### 全国日产煤突破百万吨  连续十天发出高产“卫星”

    全国日产煤突破百万吨
    连续十天发出高产“卫星”
    新华社24日讯　全国各地采煤工人和广大群众提出“为钢铁元帅备粮草而战”，在10月中旬放射出持续一旬的高产“卫星”，每天平均日产煤超过了一百万吨，比10月上旬平均日产量增加了二十多万吨。
    由于各地认真贯彻执行了“小、土、群”的方针，全民大办煤矿的群众运动已经在全国范围内广泛展开。据初步统计，由全国成千上万个地方煤窑生产的煤，这十天平均日产量比9月份平均日产量增加了70％以上。广西忻城县在全县人民中广泛进行了为钢铁储备粮草的大鸣大放、大辩论，全县展开大竞赛，由县委第一书记亲自挂帅，组织了一个包括工农兵学商共七万人的钢铁挖煤野战军，掀起了轰轰烈烈的采煤高潮，在14日采煤六十七万多吨。湖南的宜章，河南的临汝、禹县、陕县、淅川、博爱，湖北的崇阳等县，也都连续放出了日产煤炭十万吨以上的“卫星”。这些小煤窑，建井容易，能很快遍地开花，对供应分散的土高炉和小高炉燃料需要，能收立竿见影之效。
    煤炭部原来所属的大型煤矿企业，这十天的平均日产量达到五十九万多吨，比9月份平均日产量提高了八万吨。有关部门认为，大型煤矿在大力增产煤炭的同时，采取就地炼焦是有好处的。这不仅可以减少矿区存煤，便于增产煤炭，而且还可以减轻运输压力。
