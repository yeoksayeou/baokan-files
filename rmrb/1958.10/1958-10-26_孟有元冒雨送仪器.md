Meng Youyuan, a camel driver from the Seismological Team of the Geological Department of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, arrived in Qaidam in 1956 and immediately fell in love with this land of treasures. He raised eight camels and took on the transportation tasks in areas inaccessible to vehicles.

In July of this year, Meng Youyuan, alone with his eight camels, set out towards the Kunlun Mountains carrying instruments and equipment, rushing to get the instruments to the work site for surveying. Not long after departing, a dark cloud flew in from beyond the sky, thunder rumbled, and a torrential downpour, accompanied by gale-force winds and hail, swept in. The camels, capable of withstanding any natural climate change, let out a piercing cry, and even Meng Youyuan shivered. Meng Youyuan, seeing that the instruments on the camels' backs would be soaked by the rain, wondered what to do. In this tense moment, he swiftly took off his raincoat and tightly covered the instruments, letting the storm beat down on him as he marched forward, singing loudly. The surveying personnel working at the site saw Meng Youyuan drenched in the rain and the gleaming instruments, expressing their infinite gratitude and admiration. (Image Attached)

    孟有元冒雨送仪器
    青海石油勘探局地质处地震队有一个叫孟有元的驼员。1956年来到柴达木后，他就爱上了这个万宝俱全的地方。他喂养了八峰骆驼，担负着汽车不能通行的地方的运输任务。
    今年7月，孟有元一个人带着八峰骆驼驮着仪器、器材，向昆仑山进发，要把仪器赶运到工地进行勘测。出发不久，一片黑云从天外飞来，雷声隆隆，倾盆大雨，席卷而至，狂风挟着冰雹。能抗御任何自然气候变化的骆驼发出了凄厉的嘶叫，人在这时也直打寒颤。孟有元眼看驮在驼背上的仪器将为暴雨淋湿，怎么办呢？在这紧张的时刻，他唰地从自己身上把雨衣脱下来紧紧地盖住了仪器，自己却任凭暴风雨吹打，高歌前进。在工地工作的勘测人员看到孟有元被雨淋着，又看着那金光闪闪的仪器，都表示无限的感激和钦佩。（附图片）
