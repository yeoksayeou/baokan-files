    Plant Less for Higher Yields and Greater Harvests—A Revolution in Cropping Systems
    Launching a Large-Scale "Satellite Field" Movement
    The Grain, Cotton, and Oil Obtained from One-Sixth of the Cultivated Land
    Should Exceed This Year's Total Provincial Output by One to Three Times
    Hebei
    (Our dispatch from Tianjin, October 27th) Reporter Wen Ying reports: Hebei Province plans to adopt a revolutionary measure in its agricultural production planning for next year: to obtain one, two, or even three times the total output of grain, cotton, and oil this year from one-sixth of the cultivated land. This measure involves applying the experience of this year's small-scale agricultural "satellite fields" to larger areas of cultivated land, concentrating manpower, water resources, and fertilizer to strive for 18 million mu of spring-sown crops to become high-yield "satellite fields."
  In order to accelerate the enrichment of agricultural products, quickly enable the people of the province to live a prosperous and well-fed life, adapt to the need to support industrial construction with more agricultural labor next year, and gradually realize Chairman Mao's instructions for a "three-three system" of land cultivation, Hebei Province plans to obtain 100 billion to 120 billion jin of grain and 3 billion to 3.5 billion jin each of cotton and oil from 120 million mu of cultivated land. To ensure the realization of this plan, it is required to cultivate 5 million mu of wheat, 10 million mu of autumn grain, 2 million mu of cotton, and 1 million mu of oil crops into large-scale, high-yield, abundant fields. These large-scale abundant fields should yield 5,000 to 10,000 jin of grain per mu, 500 to 1,000 jin of cotton (lint) per mu, 5,000 to 10,000 jin of peanuts per mu, and 500 to 1,000 jin of sesame per mu. The harvest from these large-scale abundant fields would be equivalent to 75% or even greatly exceed the planned total output of all grain cultivated land next year, one-third to two-thirds of the total cotton output, and all or even exceed the total oil output.
    When making such a plan, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that large-scale, high-yield satellite fields are a development of small-scale satellite fields, based on the experience of small-scale satellite fields. The yield targets required for large-scale satellite fields have been proven to be easily achievable by countless small-scale satellite fields. If this requirement is realized, it will provide conditions for "planting less land and harvesting more grain," freeing up large areas of land for greening and industrial transportation construction, and especially opening up a path for saving a large amount of labor to support industry.
    Some people believe that satellite fields require a lot of labor, a lot of water, and sufficient fertilizer. Therefore, developing tens of millions of mu of large-scale abundant satellite fields will further strain the already tight labor, water, and fertilizer resources. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this view is incorrect. Due to the concentrated use of labor, water, and fertilizer, more agricultural products can be obtained, which is more economical and saves more than using labor, water, and fertilizer evenly on all land. It is precisely a good way to solve the tension. As countless facts have proven, it is more difficult for one person to cultivate ten mu of land and yield one thousand jin per mu, but it is easier for one person to cultivate one mu of land and yield ten thousand jin per mu.
    The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the transition from small-scale high-yield to large-scale high-yield is an inevitable trend in the great leap forward of agricultural production. The experience of the "abundant yield squares" in Cheng'an County proves this point. Due to the widespread establishment of people's communes, people's awareness has been further enhanced; due to this year's agricultural bumper harvest, satellite fields with yields of 5,000 jin and more than 10,000 jin per mu have spread throughout the province. People have more experience, and their thinking is more liberated. As long as these abundant fields are guaranteed to be well-fed (fertilizer), well-watered (water), deeply plowed, and densely planted, it is entirely possible to achieve tens of millions of mu of high-yield abundant fields.
    In order to realize this bold plan, the Provincial Party Committee has stipulated strong measures. It is required that abundant fields should select cultivated land that is not afraid of drought or flooding and has better soil quality; focus on planting four types of grain crops with high yields and stable harvests: wheat, millet, multi-headed sorghum, corn, and rice; universally deep plow to a depth of one and a half feet or more. Apply 300,000 to 500,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, ensure dense planting without insects; and be managed by grassroots party committees leading and organizing professional teams, from beginning to end, with designated personnel, designated plots, and designated measures. The professional teams should be responsible to the end. Each commune is required to report the list of professional teams to the Provincial Party Committee. In particular, as long as all 951 people's communes in the province launch a large-scale, high-yield abundant yield movement of ten thousand mu of ten thousand jin of grain, with each commune developing more than ten thousand mu and each production team (village) developing two hundred mu of high-yield abundant fields, and working with the target of 100 billion jin, the measures for 200 billion jin, and the drive for 300 billion jin, this plan will surely be realized.
    Now, a movement to strive for tens of millions of mu of high-yield abundant fields has been launched in various parts of Hebei. Five million mu of abundant wheat have already been sown. Spring planting plans, water conservancy, and fertilizer accumulation are also underway. (Attached photo)

    少种高产多收——耕作制度大革命
    掀起大面积卫星田运动
    在六分之一耕地上拿到的粮棉油料
    要比今年全省总产量多一倍至三倍
    河北
    本报天津27日电　记者文英报道：明年要在六分之一的耕地上，拿到一倍、二倍甚至三倍于今年全部耕地收获的粮食、棉花和油料的总产量，这是河北省在规划明年农业生产中计划采取的一项革命性措施。这项措施就是把今年零星小片的农业卫星田的经验，用到更大面积的耕地上，集中人力、水利、肥料，力争一千八百万亩春播作物成为高产的“卫星田”。
  为了使农产品加速丰富起来，尽快使全省人民过丰衣足食的生活，为了适应明年必须以更多的农业劳力支援工业建设的大跃进，和逐步实现毛主席指示的耕地种植“三三制”的要求，河北省计划在一亿两千万亩耕地上，拿到粮食一千亿到一千二百亿斤，棉花和油料各三十亿斤到三十五亿斤。为了确保这个计划的实现，要求把五百万亩小麦、一千万亩秋粮、二百万亩棉花、一百万亩油料作物培育成大面积高额丰产田，这些大面积丰产田的粮食亩产五千斤到一万斤，棉花
  （皮棉）五百斤到一千斤，花生五千斤到一万斤，芝麻五百斤到一千斤。这些大面积丰产田的收获量，就相当明年全部粮食耕地计划总产量的75％甚至大大超过，棉花总产量的三分之一到三分之二，油料总产量的全部甚至超过。
    省委在作这样的规划时指出：大面积的高额丰产卫星田，是小面积卫星田的发展，它是以小面积卫星田的经验为依据的。大面积卫星田所要求的产量指标，已经被无数个小面积卫星田证明是不难达到的。如果这个要求实现了，就为“少种地、多收粮”，为腾出大片的绿化土地和工业交通等建设占地提供了条件，特别是为节省大批劳力支援工业开辟了道路。
    有些人认为卫星田用工多、用水大，还要有充分的肥料，因此搞上千万亩的大面积丰产卫星田，会使已经感到紧张的劳力和水、肥更加紧张。省委认为，这种看法是不对的。由于集中使用劳力和水、肥，能取得更多的农产品，比在全部土地上平均使用劳力和水、肥，要节省和合算得多。它恰恰是解决紧张的一个好办法。正如无数事实所证明的，一个人种十亩地、亩产千斤是比较困难的，一个人种一亩地、亩产万斤是比较容易的。
    省委指出：由小片高产到大片高产，这是农业生产大跃进的必然趋势。成安县“丰产方”的经验就证明了这一点。由于人民公社普遍建立，人们的觉悟更加提高；由于今年农业大丰产，亩产五千斤和万斤以上的卫星田遍及全省各地。人们的经验更多了，思想更加解放了。只要保证这些丰产田吃饱（肥料）、喝足（水）、深翻地和密植，实现千万亩高额丰产是完全可能的。
    为了实现这个大胆的规划，省委规定了有力的措施。要求丰产田要选择旱涝不怕、土质较好的耕地；要抓住麦子、谷子、多穗高粱、玉米和稻谷四种产量高、收获稳的粮食作物进行种植；要普遍深耕一尺半以上。每亩施肥三十万斤到五十万斤，保证密植无虫；要由基层党委带头和组织专业队进行管理，从始到终，定人、定地块、定措施。专业队要一包到底。要求每个公社都把专业队的名单报告省委。特别是只要全省九百五十一个人民公社开展起万亩万斤粮的大面积高额丰产运动，每一个公社搞一万多亩，每个生产队（村）搞二百亩高额丰产田，按照一千亿斤的指标、两千亿斤的措施、三千亿斤的干劲去干，就一定会实现这个规划。
    现在河北各地已展开了争取千万亩高额丰产的运动。五百万亩丰产小麦已经种好。春播规划、水利和积肥等工作也在进行中。（附图片）
