Xinhua News Agency, October 30th – To commemorate the 41st anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, "Red Flag," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, will publish an editorial entitled "Hold Higher the Red Flag of the October Revolution" in its upcoming eleventh issue.

The editorial begins by saying: Forty-one years ago, the great October Socialist Revolution thundered like spring, turning the Russian land green with the east wind, and a new socialist world was born under the leadership of Lenin. From the moment of its birth, this new world has continuously demonstrated its vitality, far surpassing that of the old capitalist world. After the end of World War II, thanks to the Soviet Union's victory in the anti-fascist war and the establishment of China and a series of other socialist countries, the balance of class forces in the world underwent an epoch-making change. Around the time of the October Revolution anniversary last year, the Soviet Union launched two man-made earth satellites, and the conference of representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries was held in Moscow. These events marked a new turning point in the development of world politics: the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has further and more significantly surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp headed by the United States.

The editorial states: The forty-first anniversary of the October Revolution is also the first anniversary of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties. Everyone can see that the past year has been full of countless great revolutionary struggles and revolutionary victories, and that it has been a year in which the path of the October Revolution has achieved new victories and the arguments of the Moscow Conference declaration have been newly confirmed. Before the eyes of the people of the world, a vivid picture of the east wind prevailing over the west wind is unfolding: the new world is full of spring, while the old world is full of desolation.

After summarizing the tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire socialist camp in various fields over the past year, as well as the irresistible new situation of the national revolution, marked by the "vigorous blaze" of the Iraqi national revolution, the editorial states: In the past year, the world's reactionaries, headed by US imperialism, have suffered the most shameful defeats time and time again. The American aggressors have fallen into unprecedented isolation both at home and abroad. As the famous thesis put forward by the Moscow Declaration states, the aggressive policies of the American reactionaries "are digging their own graves and preparing their own destruction." The editorial points out that the meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev in August this year greatly strengthened the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace and the struggle of the people of the world to expose the American paper tiger and shatter its atomic war blackmail. The economic crisis in the United States and many capitalist countries, and the great leap forward in production in socialist countries, are in sharp contrast. It is easier for people to see that the unparalleled superiority of socialism will surely defeat the corrupt capitalist system through peaceful competition.

The editorial emphasizes: The prosperity of socialism and the demise of imperialism are inevitable laws of historical development that are independent of people's will. No matter how the imperialist reactionaries try to sabotage by various means, the ranks of communist parties around the world, headed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and their unity have been further strengthened. The anti-communist tide stirred up by imperialist countries has tempered the ranks of communists in various countries and made them stronger. All socialist countries and communist and workers' parties in capitalist countries have sternly criticized and condemned the Yugoslav revisionist clique and drawn a clear line with the traitors of the working class. People understand that the more thoroughly this specimen of modern revisionism, which emerged in the period when imperialism is nearing its death, is criticized, the more it will raise the revolutionary consciousness of the international working class.

The editorial states: The victory of the great October Revolution, the victory of the great forty-one years, is the victory of Marxism-Leninism. The Moscow Conference's declaration summarized the basic experience of the October Revolution over the past forty years, continued to develop Marxism-Leninism, and enriched the theoretical treasure house of socialism-communism. The editorial then elaborates on the basic principle of the unity of Marxist theory and practice, pointing out that in order to avoid making mistakes in politics, we communists must learn from the examples of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, be good at respecting and reflecting revolutionary practice, and be good at constantly summarizing experience from practice and constantly developing theory, so as to constantly use it to guide practice. The reason why Marxism-Leninism is invincible is that it can reflect and guide the ever-changing new historical practice.

The editorial, in discussing the unprecedentedly broad and profound mass movement in human history, writes: The great leap forward in production that has emerged in our country over the past year is a manifestation of the high degree of socialist-communist enthusiasm of the people. Whether we fully believe in the superiority of the socialist system, whether we fully believe in the power of the revolutionary people, and how much courage we have to achieve victory have become key factors in whether our socialist cause can achieve victory and how great a victory it can achieve. In our country, those who do not have enough faith in the superiority of the socialist system, underestimate the power contained in the people, underestimate the speed of development, and dare not imagine gradually taking steps to transition to a more advanced communist society, have been proven wrong by the lessons of countless facts over the past year.

The editorial concludes: Let us hold higher the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the red flag of the October Revolution's path and advance. Let us advance with the weapons of the Moscow Declaration. We firmly believe that socialism will surely defeat capitalism, the proletariat will surely defeat the bourgeoisie, oppressed nations will surely defeat imperialism, and emerging forces will surely defeat decadent forces.

The first article in this issue of "Red Flag" magazine is an article compiled by the "People's Daily" editorial department on Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are "paper tigers."

    更高地举起十月革命的红旗
    “红旗”发表社论纪念伟大的十月革命四十一周年
    我们共产主义者要在政治上不犯错误，就要学习马克思、恩格斯和列宁的榜样，善于尊重和反映革命的实践，并善于从实践中不断总结经验，不断发展理论，以不断用于指导实践。
    是否充分相信社会主义制度的优越性，是否充分相信革命的人民群众的力量，究竟有多么大的勇气来取得胜利，已经成为我国社会主义事业能不能得到胜利，能够得到多么大胜利的一个关键。
    新华社30日讯　为了纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命四十一周年，中共中央机关刊物“红旗”在即将出版的十一期上发表有题为“更高地举起十月革命的红旗”的社论。
    社论首先说：四十一年前，伟大的十月社会主义革命一声春雷，东风吹绿了俄罗斯的大地，社会主义的新世界在列宁的领导下诞生了。这个新世界从诞生之日起，就不断地显示出它的远远超过资本主义旧世界的生命力。在世界第二次大战结束以后，由于苏联在反法西斯战争中的胜利，由于中国和其他一系列社会主义国家的成立，使世界范围内的阶级力量对比形势发生了一个划时代的变化。在去年十月革命节前后，苏联发射了两颗人造地球卫星，在莫斯科又举行了各国共产党和工人党的代表会议，这两件事标志了世界政治的发展达到了一个新的转折点：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量进一步地、更加显著地超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的力量。
    社论说：十月革命的四十一周年也就是各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的一周年。人们都可以看到，过去的一年乃是充满着无数伟大的革命斗争和革命胜利的一年，乃是十月革命道路得到新的胜利、莫斯科会议宣言的论点得到新的证实的一年。在全世界人民眼前，展现出一幅东风压到西风的鲜明图画：新世界是满园春色，旧世界是满目凄凉。
    社论在概述了一年来苏联、中国以及整个社会主义阵营在各方面的巨大成就，和以伊拉克民族革命为标志的民族革命的“激扬熛怒”的不可阻挡的新形势后说：在过去一年中，以美帝国主义为首的世界反动派，一次又一次地遭到了最可耻的失败。美国侵略者在国外和国内都陷入了空前孤立的地位。正如莫斯科宣言提出的著名的论断，美国反动派的侵略政策“使它们自取灭亡，自己造成埋葬自己的掘墓人”。社论指出，今年8月毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的会谈公报大大加强了全世界人民保卫和平的斗争，加强了全世界人民戳穿美国纸老虎、击破它的原子战争讹诈的斗争。美国和许多资本主义大国的经济危机，同社会主义阵营各国的生产大跃进，恰恰成为尖锐的对比。人们更容易看清楚，社会主义的无比优越性，一定能够通过和平竞赛战胜腐败的资本主义制度。
    社论强调说：社会主义的兴盛，帝国主义的灭亡，都是不以人们意志为转移的历史发展的必然规律。无论帝国主义反动派怎样企图用各种方法来破坏，以苏联共产党为首的世界各国共产党的队伍和他们的团结进一步加强了。帝国主义国家掀起的反共风潮，锻炼了各国共产主义的队伍，使共产主义者更加坚强了。所有的社会主义国家和资本主义国家中的共产党和工人党，都严正地批判和谴责了南斯拉夫修正主义集团，同工人阶级的叛徒划清了界限。人们懂得，对于这种在帝国主义临近死亡时期应运而生的现代修正主义标本，批判得愈是彻底，就愈能够提高国际工人阶级的革命觉悟。
    社论说：伟大的十月革命的胜利，伟大的四十一年的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。莫斯科会议的宣言总结了十月革命四十年来的基本经验，继续向前发展了马克思列宁主义，丰富了社会主义——共产主义的理论宝库。社论接着阐述了马克思主义的理论和实践统一的基本原则，指出我们共产主义者要在政治上不犯错误，就要学习马克思、恩格斯和列宁的榜样，善于尊重和反映革命的实践，并善于从实践中不断总结经验，不断发展理论，以不断用于指导实践。马克思列宁主义之所以是无敌的，就在于它能够反映和指导不断变更的新的历史实践。
    社论在论述人类历史上规模空前广阔、空前深刻的群众运动时写道：一年来在我国出现的生产大跃进，就是人民群众社会主义——共产主义积极性高度发挥的表现。是否充分相信社会主义制度的优越性，是否充分相信革命的人民群众的力量，究竟有多么大的勇气来取得胜利，已经成为我国社会主义事业能不能得到胜利，能够得到多么大胜利的一个关键。在我国，那些对社会主义制度优越性相信不够，对人民群众中蕴藏的力量估计不够，对发展速度估计太低，不敢设想逐步的采取步骤向更高级的共产主义社会过渡的保守思想，受到一年来无数事实的教训，已经证明是不对的了。
    社论最后说：让我们更高地举起马克思列宁主义的旗帜，十月革命道路的红旗前进。让我们掌握莫斯科宣言的武器前进。我们坚信：社会主义必然能够战胜资本主义，无产阶级必然能够战胜资产阶级，被压迫民族必然能够战胜帝国主义，新生力量必然能够战胜腐朽力量。
    这一期“红旗”杂志的第一篇文章是“人民日报”编辑部辑录的毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是“纸老虎”一文。这一期“红旗”还发表了张承先的“积极开展农村的社会主义和共产主义教育运动”，谷受民等的“为钢而战，分秒必争”，郑季翘的“把街道居民组织到生产劳动中去”，中共吉林省委会的“小学也能勤工俭学”，张文英的“苦战十个月，跨过几世纪”，孟和博彦的“大跃进中的乌审旗牧民”，范文澜的“迷信四窟”等文章。
