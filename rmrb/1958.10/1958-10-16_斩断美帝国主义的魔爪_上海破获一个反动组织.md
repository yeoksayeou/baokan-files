Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 15th. Based on tip-offs from the masses and thorough investigation, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has smashed a reactionary organization led by American imperialist elements, the "Kingdom Hall." This reactionary organization was led by American imperialist element N.H. Knorr, with Jones StanlexErnest and King HaroldGeorge (both British) as the actual persons in charge in Shanghai. They recruited three counter-revolutionaries, Gu Zhengshu, Liu Wenbin, and Teng Xingrong, as the core force. Under the guise of "religious activities," they used methods such as so-called "door-to-door preaching" and "individual study" to spread various reactionary books and periodicals published by American imperialism that were hostile to the Chinese people, and carried out counter-revolutionary activities aimed at undermining China's socialist construction. Targeting the various political movements of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, they repeatedly spread various malicious rumors, incited people's minds, and attempted to expand counter-revolutionary forces to carry out various subversive and disruptive activities. The people of Shanghai saw through the sinister face of this reactionary organization and reported their criminal activities to the people's government. After careful investigation by the public security organs, conclusive evidence was obtained, and this reactionary organization was smashed. The ringleaders, Gong Sitan, Jin Hailu, as well as criminals such as Gu Zhengshu, Liu Wenbin, and Teng Xingrong, have all been arrested and brought to justice according to law.
