News report: The 50,000-strong steel army fighting in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, achieved a bumper harvest on the 29th. On that day, they produced 164 tons of pig iron and 122 tons of steel, setting a new record for the autonomous region's daily pig iron production.

Remote areas where even a single iron nail had to be transported from other places in the past, such as the mountainous Altay Prefecture and the Hotan Prefecture on the southern edge of the Tarim Desert, have also established indigenous blast furnace clusters, and iron has begun to flow. In the steelmaking workshop of the Urumqi Bayi Steel Plant, the bottom of a smelting furnace burned through. Uyghur worker group leader Kerim and Han workers Wang Zhenshan and Wang Anxin braved the high temperature and climbed into the recently shut-down furnace to repair it. They repaired the furnace twelve hours ahead of schedule, ensuring that the steelmaking converter was not short of materials.

    天山南北钢铁空前丰收
    本报讯　奋斗在天山南北新疆维吾尔自治区的五万钢铁大军，29日获得丰收。这天生产了一百六十四吨生铁和一百二十二吨钢，创造了自治区生铁日产量的最高纪录。
    过去连一根铁钉子都要从外地运入的边远地区，如山脉起伏的阿勒泰专区和塔里木大沙漠南缘的和阗专区，也建立了土高炉群，分别流出了铁水。乌鲁木齐八一钢铁厂炼钢车间有一座化铁炉炉底烧穿了，维吾尔族工人组长克里木和汉族工人王振山、王安心同时冒着高温，爬进停炉不久的炉里去抢修，提前十二小时把炉子修好了，保证了炼钢转炉没有缺料。
