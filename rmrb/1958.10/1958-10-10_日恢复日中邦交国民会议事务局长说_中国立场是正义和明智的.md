Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: According to TASS, the Chief of Secretariat of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, Yuko Doi, told TASS reporters that the Japanese people welcome the Chinese government's "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan." He said, we are closely watching the development of the situation in the Taiwan area, and we believe that the Chinese government's position is just and wise. Since the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, the only thing that must be done now is for the United States not to interfere in the resolution of this issue.

Doi said that Peng Dehuai's "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" is a blow to the US interference policy, because this letter once again convincingly shows that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and not an international issue as the US ruling clique is trying to prove. Doi emphasized, "All US armed forces must immediately and completely withdraw from the Taiwan area."

Referring to reports of the continued concentration of US armed forces in the Taiwan area, Doi emphasized that such actions by the United States can only aggravate the tense situation in the region. He said that the Japanese people resolutely condemn these aggressive actions of the US government.

Doi emphasized that the task of Japanese peace advocates and all Japanese people is to demand that the Japanese government change its hostile attitude towards China and take emergency measures to prevent American warlords from using Japanese bases to carry out aggressive provocations against the People's Republic of China.

    日恢复日中邦交国民会议事务局长说
    中国立场是正义和明智的
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社东京7日讯：日本恢复日中邦交国民会议事务局长土井裕信对塔斯社记者说，日本人民欢迎中国政府的“告台湾同胞书”。他说，我们密切注视着台湾地区局势的发展，我们认为中国政府的立场是正义的和明智的。由于台湾问题是中国的内政，现在唯一必须做的是美国不要干涉这一问题的解决。
    土井说，彭德怀“告台湾同胞书”是对美国干涉政策的一个打击，因为这个告同胞书再次令人信服地表明：台湾问题是中国的内部问题，而不像美国统治集团所企图证明的那样是国际问题。土井强调指出，“美国全部武装力量必须从台湾地区立即完全撤出”。
    土井在谈到美国武装力量继续在台湾地区集结的消息时强调指出，美国的这种行动只能加剧这一地区的紧张局势。他说，日本人民坚决谴责美国政府的这些侵略行动。
    土井强调指出，日本和平人士和全体日本人民的任务在于要求日本政府改变敌视中国的态度，并且采取紧急措施，不让美国军阀利用日本的基地对中华人民共和国进行侵略挑衅。
