Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th: After investigating ten Japanese fishing boats that intruded into China's fishing prohibited zones in May of this year, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau released 122 crew members and six fishing boats on the 21st of this month.

The six fishing boats are the No. 33 and No. 35 Kaiyo Maru, the No. 18 Shinsei Maru, the No. 5 Ariake Maru, and the No. 5 and No. 8 Shoei Maru. The No. 33 and No. 35 Kaiyo Maru intruded at 28 degrees 48 minutes 54 seconds north latitude, 122 degrees 32 minutes east longitude on May 7th. The No. 18 Shinsei Maru intruded at 30 degrees 10 minutes 30 seconds north latitude, 123 degrees 8 minutes 30 seconds east longitude on May 13th. The No. 5 Ariake Maru intruded at 29 degrees 10 minutes 4 seconds north latitude, 122 degrees 45 minutes east longitude on May 8th. The No. 5 and No. 8 Shoei Maru intruded at 28 degrees 43 minutes 7 seconds north latitude, 122 degrees 18 minutes 2 seconds east longitude on May 7th.

After interrogation, it was confirmed that the above-mentioned Japanese fishing boats violated Chinese laws and intruded into the fishing prohibited zones stipulated by the Chinese government. During the interrogation, the fishing masters and other relevant personnel on the boats confessed to the above-mentioned acts and wrote letters of repentance.

Among these six Japanese fishing boats, the No. 33 and No. 35 Kaiyo Maru, the No. 5 and No. 8 Shoei Maru, not only violated China's fishing prohibited zones but also, under the instruction of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency, used the opportunity of fishing to probe for military intelligence in China's coastal areas. According to Chinese law, the relevant personnel of these Japanese fishing boats should have been punished according to the law. However, considering that after being arrested, they reflected on and confessed to their various acts of sabotage, expressed repentance, and guaranteed never to commit such acts again, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau decided to give them lenient treatment and release them together with the other two Japanese fishing boats.

In addition to the above-mentioned released six fishing boats and 122 crew members, the four fishing boats, namely, the Himeshima Maru, the Mishima Maru, the Fukue Maru, and the Tomie Maru, and the fishing master Yoshio Kinoshita and the telegraph operator Yukio Kinoshita are still under investigation.

Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Tokyo news: The 122 Japanese fishing boat crew members, released by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau of China for intruding into China's fishing prohibited zones, returned to Hakata Port in Fukuoka, Kyushu, Japan, on the morning of October 24th. Upon arrival at the port, they unanimously praised China's leniency towards them.

When they arrived at Hakata Port on fishing boats, slogans such as "Oppose the Work Performance Rating System," "Struggle for World Peace," and "Down with the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet" could be seen everywhere from the floating bridge. Early that morning, when the Kishi Nobusuke government sent the Fukuoka "Maritime Safety Department" patrol boat "Fuyutsuki" to "protect" them, they put up a slogan "Oppose Protection" and turned their faces away, ignoring the greetings from the personnel on the "Fuyutsuki."

    我释放一批入侵的日渔船
    因有关人员表示悔悟特予宽大处理
    新华社上海25日电　上海市公安局对今年5月份分别侵入我国禁渔区的十艘日本渔轮进行查讯后，已于本月21日释放了船员一百二十二人和六艘渔轮。
    这六艘渔轮是第三十三、第三十五海洋丸，第十八新生丸，第五有明丸，第五、第八昌和丸。第三十三、第三十五海洋丸在5月7日侵入北纬二十八度四十八分五十四秒，东经一百二十二度三十二分。第十八新生丸在5月13日侵入北纬三十度十分三十秒，东经一百二十三度八分三十秒。第五有明丸在5月8日侵入北纬二十九度十分四秒，东经一百二十二度四十五分。第五、第八昌和丸在5月7日侵入北纬二十八度四十三分七秒，东经一百二十二度十八分二秒。
  经审讯证实，以上日本渔轮违反了我国法令，侵入了我国政府规定的禁渔区。在审讯中，船上的渔捞长等有关人员对上述行为均供认不讳，并且写了悔过书。
    在这六条日本渔轮中，第三十三、第三十五海洋丸、第五、第八昌和丸，不仅侵犯了我国禁渔区而且在日本海上保安厅的指使下，利用捕渔的机会，在我国沿海刺探军事情报。按照我国的法令，这些日本渔轮的有关人员，本应依法惩办。但念他们被捕后，对自己的各项破坏行为，有所反省和交代，并且表示悔悟，保证决不再犯。为此，上海市公安局决定予以宽大处理，同其他两条日本渔轮一并释放。
    除上述已释放的六艘渔轮和一百二十二名船员之外，姬岛丸、美岛丸、福江丸、富江丸等四艘渔船和渔捞长木下义雄、电报员木下幸男等二人还在继续审理中。
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：被中国上海市公安局释放的侵入中国禁渔区的日本渔轮船员一百二十二人，已经在10月24日早晨回到日本九州福冈的博多港。他们到达港口后异口同声赞扬中国对他们的宽大态度。
    当他们乘渔船到达博多港的时候，从浮桥上就可以看到到处贴着“反对勤务评定制度”、“为世界和平而斗争”、“打倒岸信介内阁”等标语。当天清早，岸信介政府派了福冈“海上保安部”巡逻艇“冬月”号去“保护”他们的时候，他们就贴出“反对保护”的标语，并且扭过脸去不理睬“冬月”号上的人员向他们打招呼。
