    Learning from Comrade Cai Shufan's Lofty Qualities
    Rong Gaotang
    The news of Comrade Cai Shufan's unfortunate death came as a great shock and sorrow. This is a grievous loss for the Party and the people, and a significant loss for China's culture and sports.
    Comrade Cai Shufan was indeed a loyal son of the Party and the working class. He was from a working-class family and participated in China's early labor movement as early as 1922, joined the Socialist Youth League in 1923, and became a Communist Party member in 1925. For thirty-six years, Comrade Cai Shufan diligently served the people, acting as the Party's most obedient tool. Wherever the Party needed him, he went. In 1954, he transferred to sports work, serving as Vice Chairman and Deputy Secretary of the Party Group of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission. His high degree of communist consciousness and political responsibility led him to develop an interest in and love for sports work. With great political enthusiasm, he excellently completed this new task assigned by the Party. He often endured the severe pain caused by the war-broken arm due to sudden climate changes with amazing perseverance, stubbornly persisted in his work, held meetings and studied solutions to problems by his bedside.
    In his sports work, he insisted on uncompromising struggle against all phenomena that harmed the interests of the people. During the rectification movement, right-wing elements clamored arrogantly to abolish the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, attempting to usurp the Party's leadership over sports. He keenly discerned the enemy's conspiracy and immediately resolutely led and participated in the counterattack against the right-wing elements in the sports world, safeguarding the socialist direction of sports. He was very caring for sports cadres and athletes, but he never tolerated or condoned their mistakes and shortcomings. He was also very strict with himself, always conscientiously examining shortcomings in his work, immediately improving them, and never covering up his faults.
    His ideological style was humble and simple, treating people equally as an ordinary worker. No matter how many achievements he made, he never took credit for himself, but attributed it to the Party and the masses. He conscientiously studied the Party's instructions and sports business, diligently studied political theory and culture, and always humbly asked the Party for instructions and the masses for advice when he encountered things he did not understand or was not sure about. After being elected as an alternate member of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1956, he became even more humble and cautious. He often went deep into the grassroots, lived with the athletes, taught them, and learned from them at the same time. This fully embodies a communist leadership style that is both a teacher and a student of the masses.
    He was full of revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism. He often educated cadres with the magnificent prospects of communism, working with full confidence. Whatever the Party had decided to do, he always relied on the masses, united the masses, and implemented it resolutely. He resolutely opposed the mentality of being a slave and demanded that sports cadres and athletes break with superstition and dare to innovate. He firmly believed that the sports movement led by the Party could also advance at a high speed of one day equaling twenty years.
    Comrade Cai Shufan's life was the glorious fighting life of a staunch proletarian warrior. He was an excellent leader in the sports field. His lofty communist qualities and excellent style will always inspire and spur us forward!

    学习树藩同志的崇高品质
    荣高棠
    蔡树藩同志不幸遇难的噩耗传来，令人万分震惊和悲痛。这是党和人民一个沉痛的损失，是我国文化、体育事业的重大损失。
    蔡树藩同志不愧为党和工人阶级的忠实儿子。他是血统产业工人，远在1922年就参加了我国早期工人运动，1923年加入社会主义青年团，1925年转为共产党员。蔡树藩同志三十六年如一日地勤勤恳恳为人民服务，作党最驯服的工具。党需要他到那里，就到那里。1954年他转业到体育岗位上，担任了国家体委副主任和党组副书记，高度的共产主义觉悟和政治责任心，使他对体育工作产生了兴趣和热爱。他以巨大的政治热情出色地完成了党所交给的这一新任务。经常以惊人的毅力，忍受战争中被打断的胳臂因气候突变而发作的剧痛，顽强地坚持工作，在病榻旁开会、研究处理问题。
    在体育工作岗位上，他坚持与一切危害人民利益的现象作不调和的斗争。整风运动中右派分子狂妄的叫嚣取消国家体委，企图篡夺党对体育的领导权。他敏锐地识破了敌人的阴谋，立即坚决地领导和参加了对体育界右派分子的反击，保卫了体育的社会主义方向。他对体育干部和运动员十分爱护，但对他们的错误和缺点绝不姑息和迁就。他对自己要求也很严格，工作中有缺点总是认真检查，立即改进，决不文过饰非。
    他的思想作风谦虚朴素，完全以普通劳动者身份平等待人。无论做出多少成绩，从不居功自傲，而是归功于党和群众。他认真钻研党的指示和体育业务，勤奋地学习政治理论和文化，遇有不懂或没有把握的地方，总是虚心向党请示，向群众请教。1956年当选为中共八届中央后补委员后，更加谦虚谨慎。经常深入下层，和运动员生活在一起，教导运动员，同时向他们学习。充分体现了既是群众的先生、又是群众的学生这样一种共产主义的领导风格。
    他富有革命乐观主义和革命英雄主义精神。常以共产主义的壮丽前景教育干部，满怀信心地工作。凡是党已决定要干的事，总是依靠群众、团结群众，雷厉风行地付诸实现。他坚决反对奴才思想，要求体育干部和运动员破除迷信，勇于革新。他坚信党所领导的体育运动也能以一天等于二十年的高速前进。
    蔡树藩同志的一生，是一位坚强的无产阶级战士光荣战斗的一生。他是体育事业的一位优秀领导者。他的共产主义崇高品质和优良作风，将永远鼓舞和鞭策我们前进！
