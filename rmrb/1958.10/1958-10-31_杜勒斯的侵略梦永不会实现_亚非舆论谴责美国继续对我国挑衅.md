Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United States' policy of aggression against our country continues to be severely condemned by world public opinion. Many newspapers in Asian and African countries have criticized the United States for deliberately maintaining tension and a crisis of war in the Taiwan Strait, and they have also pointed out that Dulles's clamor to promote the "disappearance" of People's China is "daydreaming."

    Damascus's "Alif Baa" newspaper pointed out that Dulles's recent "visit" to Taiwan was "creating an international crisis that threatens world peace." Dulles's challenge statement will only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to eliminate the filthy foreign occupying forces. The newspaper emphasized: "The Chinese people's struggle is supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and without a doubt, victory belongs to the Chinese people."

    A commentator for Cairo's "Evening News" also cited facts to illustrate the United States' military provocations against China. He wrote that no one in the world believes Dulles's words, and the people of the whole world sympathize with and support People's China. Even the vast majority of Americans disagree with Dulles's aggressive policy toward China.

    Lebanon's "News" said in an article commenting on Dulles's trip to Taiwan that the United States' further provocations and conspiracies against China show that "the American aggressors have not realized that their policy has gone bankrupt, although sane people believe that this policy against People's China is of no use." The newspaper warned the United States: "Playing with fire is very dangerous, especially on the territory of a great country like People's China, which is supported by the Soviet Union and the socialist camp." "Dulles's dreams will never be realized, whether in China or in the Arab world."

    杜勒斯的侵略梦永不会实现
    亚非舆论谴责美国继续对我国挑衅
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美国对我国的侵略政策，继续受到世界舆论的严正谴责。亚非国家的许多报纸抨击美国蓄意在台湾海峡地区保持紧张局势和战争危机，它们并且指出杜勒斯关于促使人民中国“消逝”的叫嚷是“白日作梦”。
    大马士革“阿利夫巴报”指出，杜勒斯最近对台湾的“访问”是“制造威胁世界和平的国际危机”。杜勒斯的挑战声明只会使中国人民加强清除肮脏的外国占领军的决心。这家报纸强调说：“中国人民的斗争得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持，毫无疑问，胜利属于中国人民。”
    开罗“晚报”评论员也列举事实说明美国对中国进行军事挑衅，他写道，世界上没有一个人相信杜勒斯的话，全世界的人民都同情和支持人民中国，甚至绝大部分的美国人都不同意杜勒斯对中国的侵略政策。
    黎巴嫩“消息报”在一篇评论杜勒斯台湾之行的文章里说，美国对中国的进一步的挑衅和阴谋表明，“美国侵略者还没有意识到他们的政策已经破产，虽然头脑正常的人都认为反对人民中国的这种政策毫不起作用”。这家报纸警告美国：“玩火是非常危险的，特别是在像人民中国这样的伟大国家的国土上，人民中国是得到苏联和社会主义阵营的支持的。”“杜勒斯的梦想不论是在中国或者在阿拉伯世界，都永远不会实现”。
