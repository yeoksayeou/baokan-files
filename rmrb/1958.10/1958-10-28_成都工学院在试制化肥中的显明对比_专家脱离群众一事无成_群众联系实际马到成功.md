Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 27th: In the trial production of nitrogen fertilizer using indigenous methods by the Chemical Engineering Department of Chengdu Institute of Technology, when led by the bourgeois expert, Professor Zeng Hong of the Chemical Engineering Department, because he wanted to rely on his personal strength to act arbitrarily, he spent nearly three months without any results. However, under the direct leadership of the Party organization, by mobilizing the masses, success was achieved in eleven days.

This experiment was originally proposed by Zeng Hong in June. The General Party Branch of the Department sent some young teachers and students to conduct the experiment under his leadership. However, Zeng Hong was conducting this experiment to pursue personal achievement. He belittled and ostracized the young people who cooperated with him, saying that young people could only use their hands, and that thinking was his own business. He did not announce the experimental plan to everyone, nor did he ever discuss it with the young teachers and students participating in the experiment. People could only operate like machines under his command. In terms of experimental methods, Zeng Hong was anxious to come up with a set of so-called "authentic indigenous methods" to show himself off. He wanted to rely on books to find materials and opposed conducting laboratory tests again. When young people offered opinions on the work, he put on airs and got angry. He turned a deaf ear to the Party organization's help and advice. As a result, time passed day by day, but the experimental work made no progress.

Based on these circumstances, the Party Committee of the Institute decided that the Party Committee Secretary would take charge and establish a leading group for indigenous nitrogen fertilizer production, adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods for the experiment. After gaining experience, they would gradually study using indigenous methods to replace them. Laboratory tests would also be conducted simultaneously. The leading group also decided to build several different furnace types of nitriding furnaces to conduct parallel experiments, learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses. These decisions were unanimously supported by the young people, but Zeng Hong was very unhappy. He believed that no one in the institute could lead the experiment of so many nitriding furnaces and stated that he would only be in charge of the original No. 1 nitriding furnace experiment. He was determined to compete with the leadership of the Party and even declared: I want to see who can produce something!

Under the direct leadership of the Party organization, some other young teachers and students of the institute also began the experiment of indigenous nitrogen fertilizer production. Some students had never done specialized chemical experiments and were so nervous in the laboratory that they didn't know what to do. In this work, the Party organization firmly grasped several key points. First, Party and League organizations were established among the participants in the experiment, and everyone was regularly encouraged to strengthen their confidence. After each experiment, a mass summary was conducted. When encountering difficulties or failures, the causes were jointly explored, and solutions were studied. As a result, everyone's enthusiasm became higher and higher. Second, some people were assigned to conduct experiments in the laboratory on various influencing conditions such as temperature, gas composition, and catalyst selection to systematically find data and process conditions for each link. Another group used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build three nitriding furnaces with different structures and process conditions to explore production rules. The Party organization also fully mobilized the masses. Not only did other teachers in the Chemical Engineering Department often offer ideas, but young teachers and students also studied difficult problems in refractory materials and cast iron materials with teachers from the Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering Departments. Thus, working day and night, the experiment was successful in just eleven days. The newly built No. 4 nitriding furnace achieved very good results in its first test firing. The nitriding rate and ammonia production rate were both high, and the output was very stable.

During this period, the No. 1 furnace led by Zeng Hong was still following his old path. Although the twenty or so young people participating in the experiment were also very enthusiastic, their strength could not be brought into play because there was no overall plan and the professor did not discuss it with everyone. As a result, this nitriding furnace was dismantled and repaired more than twenty times, taking three months, and the nitriding rate and ammonia production rate were always zero.

    成都工学院在试制化肥中的显明对比
    专家脱离群众一事无成  群众联系实际马到成功
    新华社成都27日讯　成都工学院化工系用土法制氮肥的试验工作，在资产阶级专家、化工系教授曾宏领导试验时，因为他想凭个人力量独断独行，花费了近三个月时间，毫无成效；可是在党组织的直接领导下发动群众，却在十一天内就得到了成功。
    这项试验本来是曾宏在六月间提出的，中共系总支派了一些青年师生在他领导下进行试验。但曾宏搞这一试验是为了追求个人成就。他轻视、排挤同他合作的青年人，说青年人只能动手，动脑是他自己的事。他不向大家公布试验计划，也从不和参加试验的青年师生共同研究。人们只能在他指挥下像机器一样操作。在试验方法上，曾宏急于搞出一套所谓“道地土办法”来表现自己，想依靠书本找材料，反对再作实验室试验。青年人对工作提意见，他就摆架子，发脾气。党组织帮助他、劝告他，他也充耳不闻。结果，时间一天一天过去，试验工作却没有进展。
    根据这些情况，学院党委决定由党委书记挂帅，成立土法制氮肥领导小组，采用土洋结合办法进行试验，取得经验后再逐步研究用土办法代替，实验室试验也同时进行。领导小组并决定多建几个不同炉型的氮化炉，进行平行试验，取长补短。这些决定得到青年人一致拥护，但曾宏却很不高兴。他认为学院里无人能领导这样多氮化炉的试验，并表示他自己只管原有的一号氮化炉试验工作。他决心和党的领导较量一下，还扬言说：我倒要看看谁能搞出东西来？
    在党组织的直接领导下，学院另一些青年师生也开始了土法制氮肥的试验工作。有的学生从未作过专门化试验，在实验室里紧张得手脚无措。在这一工作中，党组织紧紧抓住了几个关键。首先，在参加试验的人员中建立了党和团的组织，经常鼓励大家坚定信心，每次试验后都进行群众性总结，遇到困难或失败，就共同探讨原因，研究解决办法，因而大家的情绪愈来愈高涨。其次，有计划地分配一部分人在实验室就温度、气体成份、触媒选择等各个影响条件分组进行试验，系统寻找各个环节的数据和工艺条件；另一部分人用土洋结合办法，建了三个不同结构和工艺条件的氮化炉，摸索生产规律。党组织还充分发动了群众，不仅化工系其他教师经常出主意，青年师生还同机械系和土木系的教师研究耐火材料、铸铁材料等方面的疑难问题。这样，日夜苦战，仅仅十一天功夫，试验就获得成功。新建的四号氮化炉第一次试烧就获得很好的结果，氮化率和产氨率都较高，产量也很稳定。
    在这期间，曾宏领导的一号炉却仍然走着他的老路。虽然参加试验的二十来个青年人干劲也挺大，但由于没有全盘计划，这位教授又不和大家商量，他们的力量就无法施展出来。结果，这个氮化炉前后拆修二十多次，费时三个月，氮化率和产氨率都一直是零。
