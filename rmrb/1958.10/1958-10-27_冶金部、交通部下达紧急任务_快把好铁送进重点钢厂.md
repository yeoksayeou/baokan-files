Xinhua News Agency, October 25th—Minister of Metallurgical Industry Wang Heshou said at a telephone conference on the 25th that the most urgent and important task on the national iron and steel front right now is to immediately collect and transport good pig iron from various regions to support key steel plants across the country. This matter is of extremely great importance to completing this year's steel production plan.

    This telephone conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Communications to urgently deploy the transfer and transportation of pig iron. Participating in the telephone conference were thirteen provinces and cities: Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, Sichuan, Liaoning, Shanghai, and Beijing.

    Wang Heshou analyzed the current national steel production situation at the meeting. He said that since the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee in August, the mass movement for steel production has unfolded nationwide. In the past two months, national steel production has grown rapidly. It now appears that all regions across the country have sufficient confidence in completing and striving to complete this year's plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel. However, the most prominent and urgent problem currently emerging on the steel front is that the iron produced in various regions has not been promptly transferred from decentralized smelting points, thus seriously affecting the supply of pig iron needed by key steel plants. If this problem is not resolved immediately, it will affect this year's and even next year's steel production plans and steel supply. He demanded that the metallurgical bureaus (departments) of all provinces immediately mobilize, step up the collection and transportation of pig iron in accordance with the state plan, and ensure the needs of steel plants nationwide.

    Minister of Communications Wang Shoudao instructed the staff of transportation departments in various regions at the meeting to immediately organize manpower and various means of transportation, launch a crash program to build roads, and form a strong iron and steel transportation line. The task of transporting pig iron should be ranked first in the current transportation work to ensure completion on schedule.

    Key steel enterprises account for more than 80% of this year's national steel production plan. These key enterprises need millions of tons of pig iron in the fourth quarter, of which about half can be supplied by the provinces where the key enterprises are located, and the other half needs to be collected and transferred in from other provinces. In order to complete this arduous transfer task, all provinces pledged at the meeting to increase pig iron production while stepping up transfer and transportation, vigorously build roads, mobilize various water and land transportation means and civilian transportation tools, and mobilize the masses to adopt the method of "ants moving a mountain" to transport decentralized pig iron to transportation trunk lines and steel plants. The People's Liberation Army garrisons in many areas have also specially allocated a batch of vehicles to support iron transportation. The state has also allocated a batch of cars and trailers to key provinces and regions for steel production during this period to meet the needs of iron transportation.

    Shanghai's steel plants bear the heavy responsibility of supplying most of the country's medium and small-sized steel products. Henan, Guangxi, Hunan, Shandong, Anhui and other provinces guaranteed at the meeting to do their best to take measures to collect more than one million tons of pig iron in the fourth quarter to support Shanghai's steel plants. They stated that supporting Shanghai's steelmaking is equivalent to supporting themselves.

    Finally, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Communications decided that, in addition to the cadres already sent to help with transportation, they would immediately organize strong transportation teams to go to various regions to jointly take specific measures with relevant provinces and cities to complete the task of guaranteeing the supply of pig iron needed by key enterprises.

    冶金部、交通部下达紧急任务
    快把好铁送进重点钢厂
    新华社25日讯　冶金工业部部长王鹤寿25日在一次电话会议上说，目前全国钢铁战线上一个急迫的头等重要的任务，是立即把各地好的生铁调集运输出来，支援全国各地的重点炼钢厂，这个问题对完成今年钢产量计划有极为重大的关系。
    这个电话会议是由冶金工业部和交通部为紧急部署调运生铁而联合召开的。参加电话会议的是山西、河北、河南、山东、江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北、广西、四川、辽宁、上海和北京共十三个省市。
    王鹤寿在会上分析了当前全国钢铁生产情况。他说，自从8月党中央政治局扩大会议以后，钢铁生产的群众运动，已经在全国范围内展开了。两个月来，全国钢铁生产增长得很快，现在看来，全国各地对于完成和争取提前完成今年产钢一千零七十万吨的计划是有足够的信心的。但是，目前钢铁战线上出现了一个最突出、最急迫的问题，就是各地生产的铁没有从分散的冶炼点上及时调运出来，因而严重影响到各重点炼钢厂所需生铁的供应。这个问题如不立即解决，将会影响到今年甚至明年的钢产量计划和钢材供应。他要求各省冶金局（厅）立即动员起来，按照国家计划加紧集运生铁，保证全国各炼钢厂的需要。
    交通部部长王首道在会上指示各地交通部门职工，立即组织人力和各种交通工具，突击修筑道路，组成一个强有力的钢铁运输线；要把运输生铁的任务排在当前运输工作的第一位，保证按期完成。
    今年全国的钢产量计划，重点钢铁企业占80％以上。这些重点企业在第四季度需要数百万吨生铁，其中约有一半可以由各重点企业的所在省供应，另一半则需外省集运调进。为了完成这个繁重的调运任务，各省在会上保证一边增产生铁，一边加紧调运，大力修筑道路，调动各种水、陆运输工具和民间运输工具，并发动群众，采取“蚂蚁搬泰山”的办法，把分散的生铁运到交通干线和炼钢厂。许多地区的人民解放军驻军，也特地抽出了一批汽车，支援运铁。国家也在这一时期给钢铁生产的重点省、区分配了一批汽车和拖车，适应运铁需要。
    上海市各炼钢厂担负着供应全国大部分中、小型钢材的重任，河南、广西、湖南、山东、安徽等省在会上保证尽力采取措施，在第四季度内调集一百多万吨生铁，支援上海各炼钢厂。他们表示，支援上海炼钢，就等于支援他们自己。
    最后，冶金部和交通部决定，除已派出帮助运输的干部外，立即再组织强的运输小组分赴各地，和有关各省、市共同采取具体措施，完成保证供应重点企业所需生铁的任务。
