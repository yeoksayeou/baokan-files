Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th - "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published a commentary today, supporting the measure of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's order on the 13th that the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front cease shelling Jinmen for another two weeks, and resolutely demanding that the U.S. imperialists immediately get out of Taiwan.
The commentary stated that the Chinese government's measure is a manifestation of the firm will of the Chinese people to resolve their own internal affairs by peaceful means and to resolutely prevent the U.S. imperialist aggressive clique from rudely interfering in China's internal affairs. This measure is of great significance. The U.S. imperialists' clamorous attempts to confuse this measure with a so-called "ceasefire" to cover up the truth of the matter are meaningless.
The commentary emphasized that the root cause of the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area lies in the fact that the U.S. imperialist aggressive clique has deployed a huge military force to this area, forcibly occupying Taiwan and China's coastal islands, and interfering in China's internal affairs. Therefore, as long as U.S. imperialism withdraws its aggressive troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, the tense situation in this area will be resolved.
The commentary stated that it is none of the business of the U.S. aggressors living in the Eastern Pacific when China stops shelling or starts shelling in its own territory.
The commentary concluded that if the U.S. imperialists disregard the warnings of the Chinese people and the condemnation of the world's peace-loving people, and continue to forcibly occupy Taiwan and strengthen their aggressive actions, they will inevitably burn themselves by playing with fire.
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 16th - The Mongolian "Unen" published a commentary today, exposing and condemning the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and once again expressed support for the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu.
The commentary stated that U.S. imperialism is trying every possible means to legitimize its behavior of rudely interfering in China's internal affairs. Due to the continued armed provocations against China by the United States, the situation in the Far East remains tense.
The commentary condemned U.S. imperialism's armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan and its unreasonable interference in the Chinese people's struggle to liberate their own territory. The commentary stated that the United States even attempts to promote the bankrupt "two Chinas" conspiracy, which violates international law, to the United Nations and other international organizations. The so-called "ceasefire" of U.S. imperialism is nothing but a trick of the masterminds in the White House, another way of saying Dulles and his ilk are conspiring to create "two Chinas." The commentary solemnly pointed out that there is only one China in the world, that is, the People's Republic of China. The right of the government of the People's Republic of China to represent China is sacred and inviolable.
The commentary stated that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union resolutely struggles against any attempt to infringe upon China's legitimate rights in international affairs. The U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas" has been strongly condemned by world public opinion.
Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 16th - The Albanian "Bashkimi" published a commentary on the 16th, saying that Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to compatriots in Taiwan is a great call for patriotism. The commentary stated that the Chinese people have every right to use various methods, including force, to liberate their own territory. The commentary criticized the so-called "ceasefire" conspiracy played by U.S. imperialism. The commentary stated that there is no war between China and the United States, so there can be no so-called "ceasefire" issue.
The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the U.S. authorities in playing the so-called "ceasefire" diplomatic trick is only to hinder China from realizing its right to liberate its own territory, and to enable the U.S. aggressors to expand their scope of aggression from Taiwan to the coastal islands and the Chinese mainland. At the same time, this sinister conspiracy also aims to create "two Chinas."
The commentary told the U.S. adventurers to pay attention to the repeated warnings from the Chinese people. The commentary said that just as Mao Zedong said, "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be sentenced to hanging by the people of the world one day."

    不许美国继续玩弄“停火”阴谋
    兄弟国家报纸支持我国解放台湾的正义斗争
    新华社平壤16日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天发表评论，支持中国国防部13日命令福建前线的人民解放军对金门炮击再停两星期的措施，并坚决要求美帝国主义者立即滚出台湾。
    评论说，中国政府这一措施是中国人民要以和平的方法解决自己的内政问题和决不允许美帝国主义侵略集团对中国内政进行粗暴干涉的坚强意志的表现，这一措施是具有重大意义的。美帝国主义者大肆叫嚣企图把这一措施和所谓“停火”混为一谈，来掩盖事件真相的把戏都是毫无意义的。
    评论强调指出，造成台湾海峡地区的紧张局势的根本原因，就在于美帝国主义侵略集团把庞大的军事力量投到这个地区来，强占台湾和中国沿海岛屿，干涉中国内政。所以只要美帝国主义从台湾和台湾海峡地区撤出它的侵略军，这一地区的紧张局势就会得到解决。
    评论说，中国人民在自己的领土内何时停止炮击或开炮，对住在东太平洋的美国侵略者没有任何相干。
    评论最后说，如果美帝国主义者不顾中国人民的警告和世界爱好和平人民的谴责，继续强占台湾和加强侵略行为，那么它必将玩火自焚。
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表评论，揭露和谴责美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且再次表示支持中国人民解放台、澎、金、马的斗争。
    评论说，美帝国主义千方百计地企图把它粗暴干涉中国内政的行为合法化。由于美国继续对中国进行武装挑衅，远东局势仍然紧张。
    评论谴责美帝国主义武装侵占中国领土台湾横蛮无理地干涉中国人民解放自己领土的斗争。评论说，美国竟然企图把违反国际法准则的破产了的“两个中国”的阴谋，推销到联合国及其他国际组织中去。美帝国主义的所谓“停火”只不过是白宫的祸首们的诡计，是杜勒斯之流阴谋制造“两个中国”的另一种说法。评论严正指出，世界上只存在一个中国，就是中华人民共和国。中华人民共和国政府代表中国的权利是神圣不可侵犯的。
    评论说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚决同侵犯中国在国际事务中的合法权利的任何企图进行斗争。美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋已经遭到世界舆论的强烈谴责。
    新华社地拉那16日电　阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”16日发表评论说，中国国防部长彭德怀的告台湾同胞书是爱国主义的巨大号召。评论说，中国人民完全有权利采用包括武力在内的各种方法解放自己的领土。评论斥责美帝国主义玩弄的所谓“停火”阴谋。评论说，中美两国之间并不存在战争，这就不可能产生所谓“停火”问题。
    评论指出，美国当局玩弄所谓“停火”这一外交手腕的目的，只是为了阻挠中国实现解放自己领土的权利，并且使美国侵略者有可能把它的侵略范围从台湾扩大到沿海岛屿以及中国大陆上去。同时，这一罪恶阴谋还有制造“两个中国”的目的。
    评论要美国冒险者注视中国人民一再提出的警告。评论说，正像毛泽东所说的“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。”
