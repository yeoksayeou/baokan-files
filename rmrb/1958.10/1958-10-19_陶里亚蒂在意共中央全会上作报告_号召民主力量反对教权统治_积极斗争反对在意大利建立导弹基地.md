Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 18th. TASS reports: The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party recently held a plenary session in Rome. "Unità" published on the 17th the report made by the General Secretary of the Central Committee, Togliatti, at the meeting, entitled "Our Struggle Against Clerical Rule, for Freedom, Peace, and Social Renewal."

In his report, Togliatti pointed out that the characteristic of the current situation in Italy is that the democratic rights of citizens and progressive organizations are being violated in an increasingly vile and frequent manner, and the police are taking increasingly rampant actions against the working people for the benefit of the business owners. Citizens are being discriminated against because of their different political beliefs. Italy has not implemented the most pressing reforms: land reform, nationalization of large monopolies, and reforms of the social insurance and social welfare systems.

In agriculture, the dominance of capitalist large farms and the rampant oppression of large landlords are making work for farm laborers increasingly scarce. Hundreds of thousands of poor peasants and tenant farmers are being driven off the land, and the prices at which they sell their products cannot compensate for their labor.

When talking about the Italian government's foreign policy, Togliatti said that the Italian government's agreement to set up American rocket launch sites within Italy contains a serious danger. The government did not consult with the parliament on this issue. It is unwilling to consider the will expressed by the eleven million voters who voted for the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Like previous governments, it obeys the United States Department of State.

Togliatti pointed out that the Communist Party should respond to this policy of the government by vigorously carrying out the struggle for peace. Actively opposing the establishment of missile bases in the country is the main goal of this struggle at present. At the same time, Communists should actively defend the parliamentary system, demand local autonomy, oppose any arbitrary measures, expose the national clericalization and corruption, and safeguard the interests of the working people.

Togliatti called on Communists to organize all democratic forces nationwide to lead the masses in the struggle against clericals, create the conditions necessary for national economic renewal, and effectively safeguard democracy and peace.

On the 17th, the Central Committee continued to hold meetings to discuss Togliatti's report.

    陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上作报告
    号召民主力量反对教权统治
    积极斗争反对在意大利建立导弹基地
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会最近在罗马举行全体会议。“团结报”17日刊载了中央委员会总书记陶里亚蒂在会议上作的报告，题目是“我们为反对教权统治，争取自由、和平和社会革新而斗争”。
    陶里亚蒂在报告中指出，目前意大利国内局势的特点是，公民和进步团体的民主权利遭到越来越卑鄙和经常的侵犯，警察为了企业主的利益而对劳动人民采取的行动日益猖狂。公民因为政治信仰不同而遭到歧视。意大利没有实行最迫切的改革：土地改革、大垄断企业国有化以及社会保险和社会赡养制度的改革。
    在农业中，资本主义大农场的优势和大地主的横行霸道使得雇农的工作越来越少了，成千上万的贫农和佃农被赶出土地，他们出卖产品的价格不能抵偿他们的劳动。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到意大利政府的对外政策时说，意大利政府同意在意大利境内设置美国火箭发射场，这蕴藏着严重的危险。政府没有就这个问题同议会磋商，它不愿考虑一千一百万投票赞成共产党和社会党的选民所表达的意志。它同以往的政府所做的一样，对美国国务院唯命是从。
    陶里亚蒂指出，共产党应当用大力进行争取和平的斗争的办法来回答政府的这个政策。积极反对在国内建立导弹基地是这个斗争目前的主要目标。同时，共产党人应当积极保卫议会制度，要求给予地方自治，反对任何专横措施，揭露国家教权化、贪污舞弊的情况、维护劳动人民的利益。
    陶里亚蒂号召共产党人在全国范围内组织一切民主力量来领导群众同教权派作斗争，创造全国经济革新所必要的条件，并有效地维护民主和和平。
    17日，中央委员会继续举行会议，讨论陶里亚蒂的报告。
