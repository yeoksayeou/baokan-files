    Supply System Changed to Wage System is a Regression
    After reading Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article "Breaking Down Bourgeois Right Ideology," we were greatly inspired. We believe that the views in this article are fundamentally correct. We completely agree with his emphasis on the assertion: "Years of practice have proven that the attacks on the 'supply system,' 'rural work style,' and 'guerrilla habits' are, in fact, attacks by the bourgeoisie to protect unequal bourgeois rights, to strike at the proletarian revolutionary tradition, and to attack the communist principles of correctly handling the internal relations of the working people." As everyone knows, during the period of the democratic revolution in our country, due to the low level of production and the special environment of the revolutionary war, the revolutionary ranks led by the Party had long lived a life of military communist supply system. Although this life was very hard, it did not shake the will and determination of every true revolutionary, on the contrary, it tempered this will and determination. A passage from Martyr Fang Zhimin expresses the strong will and unshakable determination of all revolutionary fighters with communist consciousness. He said: "For the liberation of the class and the nation, for the success of the Party's cause, I do not covet magnificent mansions, but would rather live in humble and damp thatched huts; I do not covet delicious Western cuisine, but would rather swallow thorny corn and vegetable roots; I do not covet comfortable and soft steel wire beds, but would rather sleep in pigsty-like dwellings! I do not covet leisure, but would rather work hard for sixteen hours a day! I do not covet wealth, but would rather be impoverished! I am not afraid of hunger, not afraid of cold, not afraid of danger, not afraid of difficulties. Humiliation, pain, and all unbearable lives, I can endure! These cannot shake my determination in the slightest, on the contrary, they will further temper my will! I can give up everything, but I cannot give up the Party, give up the class, give up the revolutionary cause. As long as I have one day of life, I should work for them for one day!"
    History fully proves that the implementation of the supply system not only fully mobilized all material and financial resources, ensuring the supply of military and civilian food in the liberated areas, and supporting the revolutionary war; but also further promoted communist ideology, strengthened internal unity within the revolution, and also cultivated the revolutionary team's fine style of hard work and simplicity, greatly promoting the connection with the broad masses.
    After the national liberation, due to the existence of capitalist economy and a large number of individual economies, due to the still very low level of production development, and the still large differences in people's labor, it was of course impossible to implement the communist distribution form—the supply system, but only to generally implement the socialist distribution principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" wage system.
    The principle of "to each according to his work" is a manifestation of bourgeois right in the distribution issue. Means of living are not distributed according to needs, but according to the quantity and quality of labor. Due to differences in people's labor ability and differences in the population of each family, a certain degree of inequality is bound to arise. Therefore, in the eyes of communists, our implementation of this distribution system for a certain period is not to preserve it forever, but to use it as a tool to gradually create conditions so as to finally eliminate it fundamentally.
    Therefore, we believe that after the national liberation, among the revolutionary cadres who originally implemented the supply system, the supply system should continue to be implemented, allowing it to coexist with the wage system. Moreover, the scope of the supply system should be continuously expanded to gradually replace the wage system. This would better promote our revolutionary tradition and greatly facilitate the elimination of bourgeois right ideology. In fact, after the nationwide implementation of the wage system, the supply system did coexist with the wage system for a considerable period. During this time, with the exception of a very small number of people who were affected by bourgeois ideology and showed wavering, the vast majority of veteran comrades were completely in favor of it. They adhered to the fine revolutionary tradition. This means that the realistic conditions for maintaining and developing the original supply system were available. At that time, we believe that changing from the supply system to the wage system among this group of people was a step backward, a compromise and concession to bourgeois right ideology.
    Currently, our country is undergoing a great and profound social transformation. On the basis of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the relations of production are undergoing tremendous changes. The upsurge of the people's commune movement has been launched throughout the country. The distribution principle of "to each according to his work" can no longer fully meet the requirements of production development. The conditions for gradually implementing the communist distribution principle have matured. At present, many people's communes are implementing a semi-supply system, which is the inevitable product of this situation.

    供给制改工资制是一种倒退
    读了张春桥同志的“破除资产阶级的法权思想”一文，我们受到了很大的启发。我们认为：这篇文章的观点基本上是正确的。我们完全同意他所强调指出的这样一种论断：“经过几年来的实践，证明了对‘供给制’、对‘农村作风’、‘游击习气’的攻击，实际上是资产阶级为了保护不平等的资产阶级的法权，为了打击无产阶级的革命传统，而对正确处理劳动人民内部相互关系的共产主义原则的攻击”。大家知道：在我国民主革命时期，由于生产水平低下和革命战争的特殊环境，在党所领导的革命队伍中，曾经长期地过着军事共产主义的供给制生活。尽管这种生活十分艰苦，但是，它丝毫没有动摇每一个真正革命者的意志和决心，相反，恰恰锻炼了这种意志和决心。方志敏烈士说过的一段话，集中表露了一切具有共产主义觉悟的革命战士的这种坚强的意志和不可移易的决心。他说：“为着阶级和民族的解放，为着党的事业的成功，我毫不稀罕那华丽的大厦，却宁愿居住在卑陋潮湿的茅棚；不稀罕美味的西餐大菜，宁愿吞嚼刺口的苞粟和菜根；不稀罕舒服柔软的钢丝床，宁愿睡在猪栏狗窝似的住所！不稀罕闲逸，宁愿一天做十六点钟工的劳苦！不稀罕富裕，宁愿困穷！不怕饥饿，不怕寒冷，不怕危险，不怕困难。屈辱、痛苦、一切难于忍受的生活，我都能忍受下去！这些都不能丝毫动摇我的决心，相反的，是更加磨炼我的意志！我能舍弃一切，但是不能舍弃党，舍弃阶级，舍弃革命事业。我有一天生命，我就应该为它们工作一天！”
    历史完全证明：由于实行了供给制，不但充分动员了一切的物力财力，保证了解放区军需民食的供应，支援了革命战争；而且还进一步发扬了共产主义思想，加强了革命内部的团结，同时还培养了革命队伍的艰苦朴素的优良作风，极大地促进了与广大群众的联系。
    在全国解放后，由于还存在着资本主义经济和大量的个体经济，由于生产发展水平还很低，人们的劳动差别还很大，当然没有可能实行共产主义的分配形式——供给制，而只能一般地推行各尽所能，按劳取酬的社会主义分配原则的工资制。
    按劳取酬的分配原则，是资产阶级法权在分配问题上的表现，生活资料还不是照需要来分配，而是按照劳动的数量和质量来分配。由于人的劳动能力不同，每个家庭人口不同，这就必然产生一定程度的不平等。所以，在共产主义者看来，我们在一定时期内实行这种分配制度，不是为了永远保存它，而是把它作为工具，逐步创造条件，以便最后从根本上取消它。
    因此，我们认为，全国解放以后，在原来实行供给制的革命干部中间，应该继续实行供给制，让它与工资制同时并存。而且应该不断地扩大供给制的范围，逐步代替工资制。这样就能更好地发扬我们的革命传统，大大有利于消灭资产阶级法权思想。事实上，在全国推行工资制以后，供给制也曾与工资制并存过相当时期。在这个时间内，除开极少数的人受资产阶级思想侵袭而表现动摇以外，绝大多数的老同志是完全拥护的。他们坚持了优良的革命传统。这就是说，保持和发展原来供给制的现实条件是具备的。在当时，在这部分人当中，从供给制改为工资制，我们认为是倒退了一步，是对资产阶级法权思想的妥协和让步。
    目前我们的国家正经历着空前深刻的伟大的社会变革，在工农业生产大跃进的基础上，生产关系正起着巨大的变化，在全国范围内已经掀起了人民公社运动的高潮。“按劳取酬”的分配原则已不能完全适应生产发展的要求。逐步实行共产主义的分配原则的条件已经成熟。目前，不少人民公社实行半供给制，便是这种形势的必然产物。
