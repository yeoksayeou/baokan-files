Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 15th: Feng Xinliang, a clever carpenter from the Rocket People's Commune in Chengwu County, Shandong Province, with the help of Han Jiangang, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, has successfully created a high-performance high-speed ridge maker with a spirit of bold innovation. This high-speed ridge maker uses two animals, requires one operator, and can create ridges on 250 mu of land per day, improving efficiency by more than 240 times compared to manual ridge making (one person per day making one mu).

After the successful trial production of this high-speed ridge maker, the Chengwu County Party Committee immediately convened an on-site meeting to promote it throughout the county. To date, the county has rushed to produce 398 high-speed ridge makers, and the daily progress of ridge making has jumped from 1,500 mu to 80,000 mu. In this way, not only can the county's 700,000 mu of wheat fields be quickly and effectively converted into ridged fields, but also a large amount of labor can be saved.

This high-speed ridge maker has a simple structure. It is made by crossing a simple cart over a triangular harrow and nailing them together. A pair of seed drills are installed at the front of the cart, and an auxiliary automatic seeding drill is installed in the middle. Small wheels are installed outside the cart wheels to drive the automatic stirring shaft of the single-foot drill; during operation, wheat seeds can be automatically sown on the ridge. A round wooden wheel is installed at the rear of the triangular harrow to flatten the ridge. Its cost is low, only three yuan per unit, and ordinary carpenters can manufacture it.

    巧木匠冯心亮创高速整畦器
    新华社济南15日电　山东省城武县火箭人民公社的巧木匠冯心亮、在县委副书记韩健刚的帮助下，以大胆革新的精神创造成功多种性能的高速整畦器。这种高速整畦器用两头牲口，一人操作，一天可整畦二百五十亩，比原来用人工整畦（一人一天整一亩）提高效率二百四十多倍。
    这种高速整畦器试制成功以后，中共城武县委立即召开现场会议，在全县范围内推广。到目前为止，全县已赶制高速整畦器三百九十八部，每天整畦田的进度已由一千五百亩跃增到八万亩。这样，全县七十万亩麦田，不但可以又快又好地实现畦田化，还可以节省大批劳动力。
    这种高速整畦器构造简单，就是把一辆简易小车交叉在三角耙上，钉在一起。小车前端安上一对耧杆，中部装一附属自动下种耧。车轮外边再安上小轮，带动独脚耧的自动搅拌轴；操作时，麦种可自动播畦埂上。三角耙在尾部装一圆木轮，轧平畦埂。它的成本低，每部只需三元钱，一般木工都能制造。
