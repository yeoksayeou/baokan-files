People's Communes Achieve Fast and Excellent Autumn Harvest and Planting
Hubei Strives for a Double Harvest in Steel and Agriculture

(Reported by this newspaper) The newly established two thousand-plus People's Communes in Guizhou Province are demonstrating enormous advantages in the current intense autumn harvest, enabling the harvest work to be done quickly and well.  Recently, although continuous rain has affected most parts of the province, an army of five million people engaged in the autumn harvest still persists day and night in rushing the harvest.  As of the 5th, out of the province's more than twelve million mu of late rice, six million eight hundred thousand mu have been harvested.  This pace is incomparable to the past.

This year, Guizhou Province is experiencing an unprecedented bumper harvest year, with total grain production expected to reach over 20 billion jin, doubling that of last year. The amount of grain harvesting work is much larger than in the past, and with about three million out of the province's eight million rural laborers投入 committed to the industrial production front, labor appears very strained. However, due to the establishment of People's Communes throughout the province, labor is uniformly allocated, and especially the establishment of public canteens and nurseries, etc., has enabled large numbers of women to join the autumn harvest, strengthening the harvesting force.

The People's Communes' comprehensive implementation of "Three-izations" (organization militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization) is not only conducive to the organization and allocation of rural labor but also further stimulates the productive enthusiasm of farmers. After thirteen counties in the Zunyi Special District achieved "Three-izations," the 930,000-strong autumn harvest army camped, slept, and ate in the fields, and the efficiency of harvesting work doubled compared to before. As of the 5th, the autumn grain harvesting area in the entire special district had reached 90%, more than ten days earlier than last year. According to typical surveys of People's Communes in various places, the implementation of "Three-izations" can increase labor efficiency by 17%. Based on this calculation, the entire province is equivalent to adding 1.5 million laborers, greatly alleviating the difficulty of insufficient labor for the autumn harvest.

During the autumn harvest, in order to get the grain into the granary as soon as possible, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the communes automatically broke down the boundaries of districts, townships, and communes, and widely organized large-scale labor and tool cooperation between mountainous and plain areas, and early-maturing and late-maturing areas. In the Yanjiao District of Langdai County, the Shuikou team of the Tuanjie (Unity) People's Commune had early-maturing rice and felt a shortage of labor for a time. Upon hearing the news, three companies of the Gaoxing team immediately organized 380 laborers, bringing their own food and tools, regardless of remuneration, and went to help, completing the rushing harvest of all the mature corn and rice in two days and one night. Jiangkou County is an area of high slopes interspersed with plains. They adopted the method of the high slopes first helping the plain areas to carry out large-scale autumn harvest cooperation. The Xinjiang team of the Bapan People's Commune in the plain area had more than 600 mu of late rice. If they relied on the team's own strength to harvest, it would take ten days to complete, and the millet had already lodged. Delaying the harvest would cause great losses. As a result, the commune mobilized 550 laborers to bring their own sickles and baskets to assist in the rush harvest, and it was all completed in one day and one night.

(Reported by this newspaper) Although more than six million male and female commune members in Hunan Province have been vigorously engaged in steel production, thanks to the full utilization of the advantages of the People's Communes in various places, and the reasonable arrangement of labor, this year the province's autumn plowing and sowing has been progressing at a rate of one million mu per day, faster and better than in any previous year. Statistics up to the 7th showed that the province had planted more than 10.37 million mu of crops such as rapeseed, wheat, and beans, accounting for about 30% of this year's autumn planting plan. In the Shaoyang Special District, the province's iron smelting base, more than half of the rural labor force is投入 committed to steel production, but the autumn planting progress in this special district is very fast, and it has now completed 34% of the autumn planting task. According to inspections, the soil that has already been autumn-sown in the province is generally deeply plowed more than six inches, and about five to six hundred dan of fertilizer are applied per mu.

The characteristics of Hunan Province's autumn plowing and sowing this year are: large tasks, tight labor, high enthusiasm of the masses, fast progress, and good quality. This year's autumn planting plan is more than 36 million mu, an increase of 20% over last year. Due to the nationwide effort to make steel, the number of farmers participating in autumn planting is 40% less than last year, but the task has been completed faster and better.

After Hunan Province realized the people's commune system at the end of September, party committees at all levels mostly established production corps with the commune as the unit, and designated special personnel to lead agricultural production, thus ensuring the autumn plowing and sowing work. For example, the counties in the Xiangtan Special District established 190 production corps, all headed by deputy secretaries of the party committee, and they cooperated with each other, with great results. Now they have completed more than 3.74 million mu of autumn planting work, accounting for about 40% of the district's plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th - Hubei Province is vigorously implementing Chairman Mao's instruction that "while engaging in steel production, do not abandon agriculture," and has made unified arrangements and deployments for industry and agriculture, striving for a double harvest in steel and agriculture. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward such a slogan to various places: Do a good job in agricultural production, support the steel front, the front and rear areas carry out competition, and industry and agriculture leap forward together.

The provincial party committee requires that party committees at all levels and all relevant departments must make proper arrangements to prevent each acting on its own. All localities should uniformly allocate labor on the basis of people's communes, and fully and rationally utilize all labor. The people's communes in all localities must truly improve and strengthen labor management in accordance with the principles of "industry, agriculture, and military" and the spirit of "organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization." For some tasks that exceed the scope of the People's Communes and involve a wider range, the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees should make overall arrangements for labor and vigorously organize cooperation according to needs. In order to give full play to the role of the existing labor force, the provincial party committee instructed all localities to quickly establish collective canteens, nurseries, laundry groups, sewing groups, etc., so that the vast numbers of urban and rural women can fully participate in industrial and agricultural production.

The provincial party committee requires all localities to lead the masses to vigorously improve labor productivity through the development of technological revolution while uniformly arranging production tasks and allocating labor. The provincial party committee believes that it is currently necessary to continue to firmly grasp tool reform and continuously improve the utilization rate of existing tools.

The provincial party committee pointed out that the urgent task to ensure a double harvest in steel and agriculture is to resolutely fight well in October. In this month, it is necessary to first ensure that decisive victories are achieved on the steel front, and also to ensure that the autumn harvest and winter sowing are done in a timely manner. To this end, the provincial party committee requires that the first secretaries of party committees at all levels should be in charge of steel production and also concurrently manage agricultural production, and both industry and agriculture should have strong leaders in command.

    贵州收获680万亩晚稻  湖南秋播达到1037万亩
    大公无私  各尽所能  全面协作  统筹安排
    人民公社秋收秋种既快又好
    湖北力争钢铁农业双丰收
    本报讯　贵州省新建的二千多个人民公社，在当前紧张的秋收中显示出巨大的优越性，使秋收工作做得又快又好。近日来，全省大部分地区虽然阴雨连绵，五百万人组成的秋收大军仍日夜坚持抢收。到5日止，全省一千二百多万亩晚稻已收获六百八十万亩。这种进度是过去不能比拟的。
    今年，贵州省是个空前丰收年，粮食总产量将达二百亿斤以上，比去年增加一倍。粮食收获工作量比过去要大得多，加之全省农村八百万劳动力中又有三百万左右投入工业生产战线，劳力显得十分紧张，但由于全省建立了人民公社，统一调配劳力，特别是办起了公共食堂、托儿所等，使大批妇女投入秋收，增强了收割力量。
    人民公社全面实行“三化”，不仅有利于农村劳动力的组织、调配，而且更加发挥了农民的生产积极性。遵义专区十三个县实现“三化”后，九十三万秋收大军在田间扎营睡觉、吃饭，收割工作的效率比原来提高一倍。到5日止，全专区秋粮收割面积已达90％，比去年提早十多天。据各地人民公社典型调查，实现“三化”，劳动效率可提高17％。按这样计算，全省就等于增加一百五十万个劳动力，大大缓和了秋收劳力不足的困难。
    在秋收中，公社的各族农民为了使粮食早日归仓，自动打破区、乡、社界，广泛组织山区与平坝、早熟与晚熟地区之间的劳力、工具大协作。郎岱县岩脚区团结人民公社水口队的水稻成熟较早，一时感到劳力缺乏，高兴队的三个连队闻讯后，立即组织三百八十个劳力，自带伙食、工具，不计报酬，前往援助，两天一夜就把成熟的玉米、水稻全部抢收完毕。江口县是一个高坡夹平坝的地区，他们采取高坡先帮助平坝地区的办法，开展秋收大协作。平坝地区的坝盘人民公社新江队有六百多亩晚稻，如以本队的力量收割，需要十天才能收完，而且谷子已倒伏，晚收一天就会造成很大损失，结果由公社调动五百五十个劳动力自带镰刀、箩筐，协助抢收，在一天一夜内就全部收完。
    本报讯　湖南省农村虽然出动了六百多万男女社员大搞钢铁生产，但是由于各地充分利用了人民公社的优越性，合理安排了劳动力，今年全省秋耕播种每日以一百万亩的速度向前发展，较以往任何年都做得又快又好。到7日统计，全省已种油菜、麦子、豆类等作物一千零三十七万多亩，约占今年秋播计划30％。全省炼铁基地的邵阳专区，农村中半数以上的劳力投入钢铁生产，但这个专区秋播进度却很快，现在已完成秋播任务34％。据检查，全省已经秋播的土地一般都深翻六寸以上，每亩施肥约在五、六百担。
    湖南省今年秋耕播种的特点是：任务大、劳力紧、群众干劲足、进度快、质量好。今年秋播计划是三千六百多万亩，较去年增加20％，由于全民搞钢铁，参加秋播的农民却较去年少40％，但任务却完成得较快较好。
    湖南省在9月底实现了人民公社化后，各级党委大都以公社为单位建立了生产兵团，并指定了专人领导农业生产，因而保证了秋耕播种工作。例如湘潭专区各县建立一百九十个生产兵团，都是党委副书记挂帅，而且互相协作，效果很大。现在已经完成三百七十四万多亩的秋种工作，约占全区计划的40％。
    新华社武汉9日电　湖北省大力贯彻执行毛主席关于“在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉了”的指示精神，对工农业作了统一安排和部署，力争钢铁、农业双丰收。中共湖北省委已向各地提出这样的口号：搞好农业生产，支援钢铁战线，前方后方开展竞赛，工业、农业一齐跃进。
    省委要求，各级党委和各有关部门必须进行妥善的安排，防止各行其是。各地要在人民公社化的基础上，对劳动力进行统一调配，充分地、合理地发挥所有劳动力的作用。各地人民公社要真正地根据“亦工、亦农、亦兵”的原则和“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”的精神，积极改善和加强劳动管理。对一些超出人民公社范围的、牵涉面更广的工作，应根据需要分别由省委、地委、县委统筹安排劳动力，大力组织协作。为了充分发挥现有劳动力的作用，省委指示各地迅速地把集体食堂、托儿所、洗衣组、缝纫组等建立起来，使广大城乡妇女能全力参加工农业生产。
    省委要求各地在统一安排生产任务和调配劳动力的同时，必须领导群众通过开展技术革命大力来提高劳动生产率。省委认为，当前要继续狠狠地抓工具改革，并使已有工具的利用率不断地提高。
    省委指出，当前保证钢铁、农业双丰收的急迫任务，就是坚决打好10月这一战。在这个月内，既要首先保证钢铁战线上取得决定性的胜利，又要保证及时地搞好秋收、冬播工作。为此，省委要求各级党委第一书记要主管钢铁生产，兼管农业生产，工业和农业都要有强有力的负责人挂帅。
