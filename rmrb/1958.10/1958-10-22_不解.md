    "Incomprehensible"
　　Ruan Yanshun
    Whether the Americans are genuinely confused or pretending to be, in any case, after taking a "slap in the face," they rub their burning cheeks, blink their eyes, and mutter, "Incomprehensible." The Associated Press says that officials at the U.S. State Department "have not been able to definitively guess in two weeks the reasons why the Communists stopped their shelling of Jinmen on October 5th."
    In fact, Minister Peng Dehuai's two orders and one public announcement clearly stated our policy.
    The reasons for stopping the shelling: First, humanitarianism. "The 130,000 military personnel and civilians of Jinmen lack supplies and are suffering from hunger and cold; it is difficult to maintain this for long." Leaving them a "fully free channel to transport supplies" and a path to survival. Second, considering the greater national interest. "We are all Chinese. Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, peace is the best strategy."
  "It is suggested that negotiations be held and a peaceful resolution be implemented." "This benefits the ten million Chinese in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and benefits all 650 million people of the nation, which is to the detriment of the Americans." Third, driving away the demons. "This is to deal with the Americans." "The Americans staying in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait must roll back home. There is no reason for them to stay here; it is unacceptable for them not to leave." These are all plainly visible and a transparent strategy, not a conspiracy, so what is so difficult to understand?
    Regarding the resumption of shelling, it was also said in advance: First, "If there is escorting, fire immediately." Second, "If there are no peace talks, fighting is unavoidable." This is not ambiguous at all. Now, the Chiang gang clique refuses to negotiate; U.S. warships are secretly providing escort; the Americans staying in Taiwan not only refuse to roll back home but instead want to roll out from America to Taiwan to plan further implementation of the so-called "treaty," knowingly violating the rules, "Therefore, the shelling must be resumed to show punishment." If we don't fight now, when do we fight? Seeking a beating and getting beaten is surely not unexpected!

    “不解”
　　阮延顺
    美国人不知是真糊涂，还是装糊涂，总之是在挨了“一记耳光”之后，摸一摸热辣辣的腮梆子，贬巴着眼唔唔哝哝地说：“不解”。美联社说美国国务院的官员们：“在两个星期中没有能够肯定地猜测出共产党人在10月5日停止他们对金门的炮击的原因。”
    其实，彭德怀部长的两次命令和一次文告，把我们的方针说得清清楚楚。
    停止炮击的原因：一日人道主义。“十三万金门军民，供应缺乏，饥寒交迫，难为久计”。留给一条“充分地自由地输送供应品”的生路。二曰顾全民族大义。“我们都是中国人，三十六计，和为上计。”
  “建议举行谈判，实行和平解决。”“有益于台、澎、金、马一千万中国人，有益于全民族六亿五千万人，就是不利于美国人。”三曰驱鬼。“这是为了对付美国人的。”“呆在台湾和台湾海峡的美国人，必须滚回去。他们呆在这里是没有理由的，不走是不行的。”这些昭昭在目，是阳谋并非阴谋，这有什么难解的呢？
    关于恢复炮击，也早有言在先：一曰“如有护航，立即开炮。”二曰“不要和谈，打是免不了的。”这是一点也不含糊的。现在，蒋帮集团不肯和谈；美国军舰又偷偷护航；呆在台湾的美国人不仅不肯滚回去，反而想从美国滚出来到台湾策划进一步实施所谓“条约”，明知故犯，“因此，必须恢复炮击，以示惩罚。”此时不打，更待何时？找打有打，谅非意外！
