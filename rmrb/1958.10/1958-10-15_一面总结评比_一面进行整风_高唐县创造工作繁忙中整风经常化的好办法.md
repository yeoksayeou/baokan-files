Summarizing and Evaluating on One Hand, Rectifying on the Other
Gaotang County Creates a Good Method for Regularizing Rectification Amidst Busy Work

(Our Correspondent Zhu Yuemei reports) Gaotang County, Shandong Province, based on the production season, conducts on-the-spot rectification through summarizing, inspecting, and evaluating each production movement. This method has become a very good way to regularize rectification at the grassroots level.

It is impossible and inappropriate to require grassroots leading cadres to shut themselves off for rectification when grassroots work tasks are busy. Currently, in rural areas, various work tasks are mostly carried out in the form of movements, with the center driving the general, advancing wave after wave. Therefore, utilizing the summary, inspection, and evaluation during the gaps between movements to concentrate on rectification is the most practical and lively rectification method in the tense working environment of the countryside.

Since the beginning of this year, the county, township, and commune cadres of Gaotang County have conducted five on-the-spot inspections and evaluations. Each time, they carried out rectification through methods of vigorous airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, launching criticism and self-criticism, which greatly improved the ideological style of the cadres. After each rectification, all cadres were even more motivated, which better prepared their minds for the next movement. Local cadres call this method "rectification takes command" and "ideology paves the way."

Production advances wave after wave, and the rectification movement also advances wave after wave. This is a very good form of regularizing the rectification movement. This form will be promoted for a long time, with politics always in command and rectification persistently carried out.

Over the past six months, the Gaotang County Party Committee has seized several major production movements and conducted five airing-of-views debates focusing on five major issues: setting planned targets, technical specifications, water and fertilizer measures, natural disasters, and late-stage management of autumn fields, launching a fierce struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking. Facts have proven that advanced and backward thinking are prominently reflected in every production link. When old contradictions are resolved, new tasks arrive, and new contradictions emerge accordingly. For example, when setting planned targets, right-leaning conservatives only look at the backward and not the advanced, only look at the difficulties and not the favorable conditions, only look at things and not people. Wu Keyi, the secretary of the Ninth Team branch of the Lu Wei Agricultural Cooperative in Yinji Township, said: "Eating too fast will choke you, walking too fast will make you fall, you won't know wind and rain, how much cotton to harvest per mu, just look at history and it will be clear." When the Party called for pest control, right-leaning conservatives said: "If the cotton has honey (i.e., aphids), there will be a great show (meaning a bumper harvest) in the autumn"; when about 20% of the cotton seedlings died from drought, and the Party called for drought resistance, some people even said: "Cotton is a drought-resistant seedling, watering it will not produce bolls"; after the county Party committee proposed the requirement of applying 100,000 jin of fertilizer per mu for spring and summer crops, Xu Shangzhi, the deputy secretary of the Zhao Zhuang Township Party Committee, representing conservatism, openly put forward fallacies such as scarce fertilizer sources, poor fertilizer efficiency, many backward cooperatives and backward groups, the county Party committee's instructions were unworkable, and that engaging in industry affected fertilizer production to resist the county Party committee's resolution.

This is a struggle between two roads reflected in various production links. The county Party committee resolutely relied on the masses, handed over the tasks to the masses, launched a vigorous airing of views, and adopted the method of believing it when you see it, debating if you don't understand, and acting when you understand, integrating rectification and production into one. Through airing of views, debates, and on-the-spot visits and evaluations, they established examples, planted red flags, criticized conservatism, and pulled out white flags. Everyone realized from the vivid contrast that: "The road is made by walking, things are done by people, the land is farmed by people, and the seedlings are managed by people." For example, Xu Shangzhi, the deputy secretary of the Zhao Zhuang Township Party Committee, was a white flag in every movement. In the vigorous fertilizer production movement, other townships applied an average of more than 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, while this township only applied 900 jin per mu. Since Xu Shangzhi was criticized and the white flag was pulled out through rectification, this township launched a vigorous manure accumulation movement within two days. The method of conducting on-the-spot rectification through inspection and evaluation is both a production movement and an ideological movement. Local cadres said: The five inspections and evaluations conducted in the past six months are equivalent to five battles on the ideological front.

In the most recent on-the-spot rectification, the Gaotang County Party Committee organized a inspection team of more than 700 people, including county, township, commune, and team cadres, red and expert activists, and managers of "satellite" fields, to conduct a comprehensive inspection of 20 townships and 127 agricultural cooperatives in the county. Their inspection method was to set off in groups to the fields, make a quick tour, "atomic explosion" (sudden inspection), and debate while inspecting, acting upon what they said, and immediately popularizing good experiences when they were discovered. During the inspection and evaluation process, they used the methods of vigorous airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to put forward criticisms and suggestions to help various townships improve their work. According to statistics, the inspection team posted more than 8,000 big-character posters of praise, criticism, and suggestions along the way.

In order to thoroughly solve ideological problems, the Gaotang County Party Committee spent five days in Jiangdian Township to conduct a concentrated airing-of-views debate, seizing good and bad examples, establishing opposing sides, and launching an ideological struggle between two lines. At the meeting, the advanced experiences and model figures of Jiangdian and Zhangzhuang Townships, which had won the red flag, were specifically introduced, and the representatives of localism, decentralism, and the "conditions theory" and "fixed situation theory" were exposed and criticized.

Through the clear contrast between the two types of typical examples and a comprehensive and in-depth airing-of-views debate, everyone not only distinguished the boundaries between the red flag and the white flag, but also checked their own work in comparison when analyzing the reasons for the red flag and the white flag. In this way, it was actually a comprehensive assessment of the previous work of various townships, communes, and teams. All cadres were determined to learn from the advanced, plant red flags, pull out white flags, vigorously strengthen the late-stage management of autumn fields, and ensure a bumper harvest in autumn.

### 一面总结评比　一面进行整风  高唐县创造工作繁忙中整风经常化的好办法

    一面总结评比　一面进行整风
    高唐县创造工作繁忙中整风经常化的好办法
    本报讯　记者朱曰梅报道：山东省高唐县根据生产季节，通过对每个生产运动的现场总结检查评比，实地进行整风，这种方式成为基层整风经常化的一种很好形式。
    基层工作任务繁忙，要求基层领导干部关门整风这是不可能的，也是不适当的。当前在农村中，各种工作任务大都是采取了运动的形式来进行，中心带动一般，一浪接一浪地不断前进，因此利用运动间隙时间的总结检查评比来集中进行整风，这在农村紧张工作的环境，是最实际、最生动活泼的整风方法。
    高唐县的县、乡、社干部今年以来已经进行了五次现场检查评比，每次都通过大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法进行整风，展开批评和自我批评，对于干部的思想作风有很大的提高。每次整风之后，全体干部都更加鼓起了干劲，这就为下一个运动更加作好了思想准备，当地干部都称这种方式是“整风挂帅”、“思想开道”。
    生产一浪推一浪，整风运动也一浪推一浪，这是整风运动经常化的一种很好的形式，这种形式将推之久远，政治永远挂帅，整风也将长久地坚持下去。
    半年多来，高唐县委抓住了几次大的生产运动，围绕着订计划指标、技术规格、水肥措施、自然灾害和秋田后期管理等五个重大问题，进行了五次鸣放辩论，同右倾保守思想展开了激烈的斗争。事实证明，在每个生产环节都突出地反映了先进同落后思想的矛盾，旧的矛盾解决了，新的任务到来，新的矛盾又随之出现。例如，在制定计划指标时，右倾保守者光看落后不看先进，光看困难不看有利条件，光看物不看人。尹集乡鲁伟农业社第九队支部书记武克义就说：“吃饭快了要噎，走路快了要跌，刮风下雨不知道，一亩地收多少棉花，翻翻历史就明了。”党号召治虫，右倾保守者就说：“棉花有了蜜（即蚜虫），秋后唱大戏（丰收的意思）”；当棉苗旱死20％左右的时候，党号召抗旱，有的人还说：“棉花是旱苗，浇了不结桃”；县委提出春夏茬作物亩施十万斤肥料的要求后，以赵庄乡党委副书记徐尚之为代表的保守主义者，公开提出肥源少，土肥效率差，落后社和落后群众多，县委指示行不通，以及搞工业影响搞肥料等谬论来对抗县委的决议。
    这是反映在各个生产环节上的两条道路的斗争，县委坚决地依靠群众，把事情交给群众，展开大鸣大放，采取不信就看，不通就辩，通了就干的办法，把整风和生产熔成一炉。通过鸣放辩论和现场参观评比，树立榜样，插上红旗，批评保守，拔掉白旗，大家从生动的对比中认识到：“路在人走，事在人为，地在人种，苗在人管”。例如赵庄乡党委副书记徐尚之，在各个运动中都是白旗，在大搞肥料运动中，其他乡平均亩施五万多斤肥料，这个乡每亩才施了九百斤。自从通过整风对徐尚之进行了批判，拔了白旗以后，这个乡在两天以内就掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥运动。通过检查评比，进行就地整风这种办法，既是生产运动，又是思想运动，当地干部说：半年来进行了五次检查评比，等于思想战线上的五次战役。
    在最近的一次现场整风中，高唐县委曾组织了县、乡、社、队干部和红专积极分子、“卫星”田管理人共七百多人组成检查团，对全县二十个乡、一百二十七个农业社进行了全面的检查。他们检查的方法是向田间分路出发，走马观花，原子爆炸（突击检查），并且一面检查，一面辩论，说了就干，发现好经验立即推广。在检查评比过程中，利用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方式，提出批评和建议帮助各乡改进工作。据统计，一路之上检查团共贴出了表扬、批评和建议等各种大字报八千多张。
    高唐县委为了彻底解决思想问题，在检查结束后，又以五天的时间在姜店乡集中进行了鸣放辩论，抓住了好坏典型，树立对立面，开展了两条路线的思想斗争。会上具体地介绍了夺得红旗的姜店、张庄两乡的先进经验和模范人物，揭露和批判了闹地方主义、分散主义和“条件论”、“定局论”的代表人物。
    通过两种典型的鲜明对比和全面深入的鸣放辩论，不仅使大家划清了红旗、白旗的界限，而且在分析红旗和白旗的原因时，都对照检查了自己的工作，这样，实际上也是对各个乡、社、队前段工作进行了一次全面鉴定。所有干部都决心向先进看齐，插红旗，拔白旗，大力加强秋田后期管理，保证秋季大丰收。
