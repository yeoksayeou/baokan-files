    Soviet Union Closes U.S. "Columbia Broadcasting System" Office in Moscow
    (TASS, Moscow) Popov, acting director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, summoned Niven, a reporter for the U.S. "Columbia Broadcasting System," on the 8th and informed him that it was no longer possible for the U.S. company's office to remain in the Soviet Union.
    Popov said that this decision was taken because "Columbia Broadcasting System" had recently broadcast radio and television programs in the United States that violently slandered the Soviet Union.

    苏联取缔美国“哥伦比亚广播公司”在苏办事处
    据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部新闻司代理司长波波夫8日召见了美国“哥伦比亚广播公司”记者尼文，告诉他美国这个公司的办事处已不可能继续留在苏联。
    波波夫说，采取这个决定是因为“哥伦比亚广播公司”近来在美国播送激烈诽谤苏联的广播电视节目。
