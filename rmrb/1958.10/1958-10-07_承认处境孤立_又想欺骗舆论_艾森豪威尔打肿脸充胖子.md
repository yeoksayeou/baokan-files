Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower wrote a letter on the 4th to Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, attempting to conceal the isolated situation the U.S. government faced due to its military provocations and war threats against China.

The letter was a reply to Green’s letter criticizing the U.S. government’s policy. Green had warned that the American people would not support the U.S. getting involved in fighting to "defend (Note: should be read as invade) Jinmen," and that if hostilities occurred, the U.S. would have no "de facto or spiritual allies." Such lamentations from figures within the American ruling group clearly made Eisenhower anxious, and he attempted to use rhetoric to deceive the increasingly dissatisfied public opinion with the U.S. government. He said, "Neither you nor any other American should think that the United States would be involved in military hostilities merely to defend Jinmen and Mazu."

However, he then contradicted himself, saying, "Of course, the possibility always exists that, under certain contingencies, after considering all the relevant facts, taking measures to ensure and protect the relevant positions of Jinmen and Mazu may be necessary or appropriate for defending Formosa (referring to Taiwan) and the Pescadores Islands (referring to the Penghu Islands)." In this way, Eisenhower admitted, against strong opposition at home and abroad, that the U.S. government still insisted on its dangerous policy of expanding aggression against China and playing with fire in the Taiwan Strait area.

In his letter, Eisenhower was still preoccupied with peddling the cliché of a so-called "ceasefire," which had long been refuted beyond repair, and lied that he was "doing his best to avoid hostilities."

Eisenhower worriedly admitted that, apart from the Chiang Kai-shek Group, no one else in the world now has a "treaty alliance relationship" with the United States on the Taiwan issue. However, he tried to put on a brave face and offer a self-deceiving justification for the isolated situation of the United States. He self-deprecatingly said that he "believed" that the U.S.'s policy of war provocation against China would receive the "support" of the U.S.'s friends and allies, and that if the U.S. "retreated," he "believed" that most of the U.S.'s allies would "panic." However, Eisenhower was unable to cite any examples in his letter to prove that his words were based on anything.

Eisenhower also self-deceivingly said that he was "unquestionably certain" that if the United States launched a war of aggression, the American people would be "united as one" to be cannon fodder for the U.S. government's war of aggression. However, the fact is that since the U.S. government intensified international tensions in the Taiwan area, the U.S. State Department has received thousands of letters from the American people opposing the government's policy, and even many Democratic and Republican members of Congress, considering the American people's anti-war sentiment, have recently criticized the government's policy.

Eisenhower finally expressed dissatisfaction with Green's criticism of the government's policy. But he helplessly admitted that there is now a saying: "If involved in war, the United States will be defeated due to domestic disunity."

### 承认处境孤立　又想欺骗舆论  艾森豪威尔打肿脸充胖子

    承认处境孤立　又想欺骗舆论
    艾森豪威尔打肿脸充胖子
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔4日写了一封信给参议院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员格林，竭力掩饰美国政府由于对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁政策所遭到的四面楚歌的孤立处境。
    这封信是对格林抨击美国政府政策的一封信的回答，格林曾警告说，美国人民不会支持美国卷入“保卫（按：应读作侵略）金门”的战斗中，而且，如果一旦发生敌对行动，美国也将没有“事实上的或精神上的盟友”。出自美国统治集团人物口中的这种哀鸣，显然已使艾森豪威尔焦虑不安，他企图用花言巧语来欺骗对美国政府日益不满的舆论。他说，“无论是你还是任何其他美国人，都不要以为，美国会仅仅为了保卫金门和马祖而卷入军事敌对行动中”。
    但是他接着就打了自己一耳光，他说，“当然，这种可能性是始终存在的，就是在某些万一的情况下，在考虑到所有一切有关的事实以后，采取措施来确保和保护金门和马祖的有关阵地，对于保卫福摩萨（指台湾）和佩斯卡多尔群岛（指澎湖列岛）来说，也许是必需或适当的”。艾森豪威尔就这样不打自招地承认，不顾国内外的强烈反对，美国政府还是坚持它对中国扩大侵略和在台湾海峡地区玩火的危险政策。
    艾森豪威尔在信里还念念不忘地想兜售那个早已被驳得体无完肤的所谓“停火”的滥调，并且撒谎说他正在“尽最大的能力来避免敌对行动”。
    艾森豪威尔十分忧心地承认，除了蒋介石集团以外，世界上现在没有其他任何人在台湾地区问题上同美国有“条约联盟关系”。但是他却打肿了脸充胖子，硬要对美国这种孤立处境进行一番自欺欺人的辩解。他自我解嘲地说，他“相信”，美国对中国的战争挑衅政策是会得到美国的朋友和盟国的“支持的”，而如果美国“退却”，他“相信”美国的大多数盟国都会“感到惊慌”。然而艾森豪威尔在信里无法举出任何事例来证明他的话是有根据的。
    艾森豪威尔还自欺欺人地说，他“毫不怀疑地肯定”，如果美国发动侵略战争，美国人民将会“万众一心地”为美国政府的侵略战争去当炮灰。然而事实却是，自从美国政府在台湾地区加剧国际紧张局势以来，美国国务院已经收到数千封美国人民反对政府政策的信件，甚至许多民主党和共和党的议员们由于考虑到美国人民的反对战争情绪，最近也纷纷对政府的政策提出批评。
    艾森豪威尔最后对格林对政府政策的批评表示不满。但是他无可奈何地承认，现在正存在一种说法：“如果卷入战争，美国将会因为国内的不团结而遭到失败”。
