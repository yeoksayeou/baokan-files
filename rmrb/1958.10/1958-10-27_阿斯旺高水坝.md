    Aswan High Dam
    On the 23rd, Soviet Premier Khrushchev announced that the Soviet government had decided to provide the United Arab Republic with a loan of 400 million rubles to help the UAR build the Aswan Dam. The Soviet Union and the UAR have concluded an agreement on the construction of the Aswan High Dam, and the UAR will use the Soviet loan to purchase machinery, equipment, and other materials in preparation for starting construction. This event once again vividly illustrates that the Soviet Union is a sincere friend of the Arab people.
    The construction of the Aswan High Dam to control the Nile River and serve production is a long-held hope of the people in the Egyptian region of the UAR. In Aswan—a vital town on the upper reaches of the Nile, south of Cairo—there was originally a low dam, but it could not meet the irrigation needs of the Egyptian region. The planned high dam will be built six and a half kilometers south of the current low dam, with the main dam project being 110 meters high and the dam crest being about three miles long. After the completion of the high dam, it can store 130 billion cubic meters of water, which can irrigate 2 million feddans (each feddan is equivalent to 6.3 mu) of land. It can change farmland that used to rely solely on Nile floods for irrigation from one season of cultivation to two seasons of cultivation and will greatly help the desert transformation plan. This will increase the production of cotton, the main economic crop in the Egyptian region, by 50%. The power station attached to the high dam will generate 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will create a new industrial base in the Aswan area. It is of great significance to the development of the UAR's national economy.
    The Aswan High Dam project is very large, and it is expected to take ten years to complete, with a total cost of approximately $1.3 billion. In 1953, the Egyptian government expressed its hope to receive $400 million in assistance from abroad. The United States and Britain had both expressed "enthusiasm" for this dam. At the end of 1955, the United States, together with Britain and the World Bank, suggested to the Egyptian government that they were willing to provide loans to help build the high dam. However, they put forward harsh conditions that harmed Egypt's national sovereignty. They demanded the establishment of some kind of "supervisory body" in Egypt to control the construction of the high dam and even to supervise Egypt's national economic policies. The Egyptian people were unwilling to accept this "aid" with conditions attached. The Cairo newspaper "Al-Shaab" editorialized at the time: "Egypt will reject any American aid if it requires Egypt to pay even the slightest bit of freedom for such aid." When the United States saw that its plan to enslave the Egyptian people was bound to fail, it announced on July 19, 1956, that it was withdrawing its proposal. The British government made the same decision that contradicted its promises the next day. The US and British imperialists have once again shown the world what their so-called "aid" really is.
    Now, thanks to the unremitting efforts of the people of the United Arab Republic and the selfless loan assistance from the Soviet Union, the Aswan High Dam will soon be under construction. As the Cairo newspaper "Al Misaa" said, "Despite the obstruction of imperialism, we will finally build the High Dam."

    阿斯旺高水坝
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫23日宣布，苏联政府决定向阿联提供四亿卢布的贷款，帮助阿联修建阿斯旺水坝。苏联和阿联已就建筑阿斯旺高水坝问题缔结了协定，阿联将利用苏联贷款购买机器、设备和其他材料，准备动工兴建。这一事件又一次生动地说明了苏联是阿拉伯人民的真诚的朋友。
    建筑阿斯旺高水坝以控制尼罗河水为生产服务，是阿联埃及地区人民多年以来的希望。在阿斯旺——开罗以南尼罗河上游的重镇，原来有一个低水坝，但它不能解决埃及地区灌溉的需要。计划中的高水坝将建筑在现在低水坝以南六公里半的地方，主坝工程高一百一十公尺，坝顶长约三英里。高水坝完工后，可以蓄水一千三百亿立方公尺，可以灌溉二百万费丹（每费丹合六点三市亩）的土地，可以使过去只靠尼罗河泛滥灌溉的农田从一季耕作变为两季耕作，并将大大有助于改造沙漠的计划。这样就可以使埃及地区主要经济作物棉花的产量增加50％。高水坝附设的发电站每年将发电一百亿度，这就可以在阿斯旺一带创建一个新的工业基地，它对阿联国民经济的发展有很大的意义。
    阿斯旺高水坝工程十分浩大，预计需时十年，全部费用约需十三亿美元。1953年，埃及政府表示希望能从国外得到四亿美元的援助。美国和英国都曾对这个水坝表示过“热心”。美国在1955年年底曾会同英国和世界银行向埃及政府建议，愿意贷款帮助修建高水坝。但是它们提出了苛刻的有损埃及国家主权的条件，它们要求在埃及建立某种“监督机构”，以控制高水坝的修建，甚至要监督埃及国家的经济政策。埃及人民不愿意接受这种附有条件的“援助”。开罗“人民报”当时曾经在社论中说得好：“埃及将拒绝任何美国援助，如果它要求埃及为这种援助付出那怕是极少的一点自由。”当美国看到它的奴役埃及人民的计划必然要碰壁的时候，就于1956年7月19日宣布撤销它的建议，英国政府于次日也作出了同样的自食诺言的决定。美英帝国主义者就这样又一次向全世界表明它们的所谓“援助”究竟是什么东西。
    现在，由于阿拉伯联合共和国人民坚持不懈的努力和苏联的无私的贷款的援助，阿斯旺高水坝不久就要动工兴建了，正如开罗“晚报”说的，“尽管帝国主义进行阻挠，我们最后还是将建设高水坝。”
