Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 7th. The "Al-Nour" newspaper published an editorial today stating that the letter to Taiwan compatriots issued yesterday by Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai is a call for peace. This call has been welcomed by people of all countries and is considered by them as another powerful piece of evidence among hundreds of others, proving that China sincerely hopes to restore peace in China.

The newspaper criticized the US proposal for a so-called "ceasefire" in Matsu and Kinmen as wanting to "hypocritically and pretentiously feign concern for peace." The newspaper said, "The United States hopes to maintain these Chinese islands as a dagger pointing at the People's China in the hands of US imperialism. It also hopes to prevent the unification of Chinese territory and make Taiwan and other islands a permanent base for war and aggression in the Far East."

"Al-Nour" pointed out that it is not difficult to recognize the true purpose of the US imperialists' hypocritical "ceasefire" slogan. It wrote: "The whole world, including broad sections of American public opinion, recognizes that Taiwan and other coastal islands are Chinese territory and should be returned to China, and that the United States should withdraw from these places. The United States' attempt to give the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's government a 'legitimate' nature is futile. Its attempt to deny irrefutable facts is futile. The more it insists on this policy, the more isolated it will become, the more its face will be exposed, and the more world opinion will condemn its actions with greater indignation."

The newspaper further pointed out that the US opposition to the Chinese people's plan is the same as the plan implemented by US imperialism against the people of all countries - such as Indonesia and Arab countries. The newspaper said that the Arabs feel that their struggle to liberate their territory with the people of China has the most powerful and consolidated connection.

### 大马士革报纸说  美国“停火”口号是虚伪的

    大马士革报纸说
    美国“停火”口号是虚伪的
    新华社大马士革7日电  “光明报”今天发表的社论认为，中国国防部长彭德怀昨天发表的告台湾同胞书是和平的呼吁，这个呼吁受到了各国人民的欢迎，并且被他们认为是其他好几百个证据中又一个强有力的证据，证明中国真诚希望在中国恢复和平。
    这家报纸抨击美国提出所谓在马祖和金门“停火”的建议是想要“虚伪地、伪善地假装对和平感到忧虑”。这家报纸说：“美国希望保持这些中国岛屿作为美帝国主义手中指向人民中国的匕首，它还希望阻止中国领土的统一，并且使台湾和其他岛屿成为在远东进行战争和侵略的永久基地。”
   “光明报”指出，要认清美帝国主义虚伪的“停火”口号的真正目的并不困难。它写道：“全世界，包括广泛阶层的美国舆论，都承认台湾和其他沿海岛屿是中国的领土，它们应该归还中国，美国应该从这些地方撤走。美国打算使卖国贼蒋介石政府具有‘合法’的性质的企图是徒劳的。它要否认不可辩驳的事实的企图是徒劳的。它越坚持这种政策，它就会变得越加孤立，它的面目就会越加暴露，就会有更多的世界舆论更加愤慨地谴责它的行动。”
    这家报纸进一步指出，美国反对中国人民的计划，是同美帝国主义所执行的反对各国人民——比如像印度尼西亚和阿拉伯国家——的计划一样的。这家报纸说，阿拉伯人觉得他们同人民中国解放自己的领土的斗争是有最有力的巩固的联系的。
