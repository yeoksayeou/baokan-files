    Supporting Lowering Manuscript Fee Standards
    Su Xing Hou Wailu Cai Yunling Wu Chuanqi
    Recently, we saw the suggestions from Comrades Zhang Tianyi, Zhou Libo, and Ai Wu in the newspapers regarding reducing manuscript fees, and we wholeheartedly respond to this initiative. Philosophy and social science workers have also long discussed this old method and are brewing suggestions for reform. We believe that the irrationality of the high manuscript fee system has become something that restrains people's communist style in today's great era.
    In today's era of the Great Leap Forward and, in particular, the high tide of people's communization, communist sprouts are growing everywhere in our country. Among the broad masses of workers and peasants, they are fighting nature day and night, constantly creating miracles and launching "satellites." The social labor productivity has increased by dozens, hundreds, or thousands of times, which prompts a new understanding of the rules for remuneration of labor. Workers and peasants are automatically demanding the abolition of overtime pay and bonuses, and demanding the abolition of piecework wages that are no longer suitable for the leap forward situation. In fact, in the people's communes, the system of dividing dividends according to labor days has been abolished, and a system of grain supply plus wages has been implemented. All of these are the development of the noblest communist spirit of mankind. At the same time, this creative change proves that under the socialist system, it is necessary to gradually weaken and even abolish the remnants of bourgeois rights that have to be retained, so as to open up a new path for liberating thought.
    The current high manuscript fee system is a remnant of bourgeois rights. Although it is not possible to completely abolish the forms of bourgeois rights overnight, we must gradually weaken them to eliminate their effects and gradually replace them with new forms guided by communist principles. Therefore, with the new situation of rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and the Great Leap Forward, the high manuscript fee standards have become an unreasonable phenomenon. The negative effects of this system are obvious. It easily makes some authors' lives special, detached from the masses, and easily promotes bourgeois ideology, especially having a bad influence on young people. A very few people struggle for manuscript fees by any means, only focusing on length and quantity, not scientific quality; the so-called "articles are written longer and longer, and manuscript fees are getting higher and higher," leading to rough and shoddy work, plagiarism, theft, and other phenomena. These are certainly not universal phenomena, nor can they be entirely blamed on excessively high manuscript fees, but it is one of the important reasons. At the same time, even based on the principle of "to each according to his work," excessively high manuscript fees will create an unreasonable phenomenon of "remuneration" not matching "labor" and "remuneration" being greater than "labor." Therefore, we believe that the current excessively high manuscript fee standards must be lowered immediately. And further abolished when conditions are ripe.
    Recently, the editorial departments of several philosophy and social science journals in Beijing—Philosophical Research, Economic Research, Historical Research, and Political and Legal Research—have prepared to reduce manuscript fees by half. We believe that this measure is very necessary, and we fully support this correct measure that conforms to the overall social development trend today.
    In order to eliminate bourgeois legal concepts and carry out reforms from the system, it is even more necessary. Therefore, in addition to supporting the lowering of manuscript fee standards, we suggest that publishing houses fundamentally consider the current manuscript fee system. The existing "copyright" and payment based on the number of copies printed is very unreasonable. In the initial stage of communism, although it is not possible to abolish bourgeois rights in all aspects, we must face up to the influence of bourgeois rights.
    We believe that after lowering manuscript fees, it will not only not affect the enthusiasm of authors to write, but also be more conducive to authors' communist enthusiasm. Today, in the philosophy and social sciences, a large number of authors are going down to factories and the countryside, going deep among workers and peasants; linking up with reality and improving writing styles, a new atmosphere has emerged. Many people have already formulated leap forward plans, wanting to greatly improve their labor productivity like workers and peasants; not only increasing the quantity of writing, but also improving the quality of writing. The measure of lowering manuscript fees will greatly promote the communist enthusiasm of the vast number of authors. At the same time, after manuscript fees are lowered, the cost of publications will be reduced to a certain extent, which will of course reduce some of the burden on readers. On the one hand, this is conducive to expanding circulation and popularizing culture, and is welcomed by the masses, and on the other hand, it is the greatest encouragement to the authors.

   拥护降低稿费标准
   苏星　侯外庐  蔡云岭　吴传启
    最近，我们从报上看到张天翼、周立波、艾芜等三同志关于减低稿费报酬的建议，我们衷心响应这个创议。哲学社会科学工作者，也早对这项旧的办法进行了讨论并酝酿改革的建议。我们认为，高稿费报酬的制度的不合理，在今天伟大的时代，已经成为束缚人们共产主义风格的东西了。
    全民大跃进、特别是人民公社化高潮的今天，在我们国家里已经到处生长着共产主义的萌芽。在广大工农劳动人民中间，他们夜以继日地向自然界开战，不断创造出奇迹、发射着“卫星”，社会的劳动生产率几十、几百、几千倍地提高，这就促使对劳动的报酬规则，提出了新的认识，工人农民正在自动要求取消加班费和奖励金，要求取消不适合于跃进情况后的计件工资，事实上，在人民公社里，已经取消了按劳动日分红制而实行口粮供给加工资制了。所有这些都是人类最高贵的共产主义精神的发扬，同时这种创造性的变革，证明了在社会主义制度下，有必要对于不得不保留下来的资产阶级法权的残余，逐渐削弱以至取消，为解放思想更打开了一条道路。
    目前的高稿费报酬制度，是一种资产阶级法权的残余。对于资产阶级的法权形式，目前虽然还不可能在一夜之间就完全废除，但我们必须逐步加以削弱从而破除它的作用，逐步用共产主义的原则所指导的新形式来代替。因此随着整风、反右派和全民大跃进的新形势，高稿费报酬标准也就成为不合理的现象了。这种制度的消极作用是明显的，它容易使一部分作者生活特殊，脱离群众，容易助长资产阶级的思想，特别对青年起不好的影响。有极少数人为稿费而奋斗不择手段，只讲篇幅数量，不讲科学质量；所谓“文章越写越长，稿费越拿越多”，以至于有粗制滥造、抄袭偷窃等等现象。这些当然不是普遍现象，也不能完全归责于稿酬过高，但它是重要原因之一。同时，即使就“按劳取酬”的原则来说，稿酬过高，也要造成“酬”“劳”不称和“酬”大于“劳”的不合理现象。因此我们认为，目前过高的稿酬标准，必须马上降低。低到条件成熟的时候，再进一步取消。
    最近，北京几个哲学社会科学刊物的编辑部——哲学研究、经济研究、历史研究、政法研究——已经准备把稿费降低一半。我们认为这个措施是十分必要的，我们完全拥护这个符合于今天整个社会发展趋势的正确措施。
    为了破除资产阶级法权思想，从制度上从事改革，就更成为必要。因此，我们除了拥护降低稿费标准以外，建议出版社从根本上考虑现行稿酬制度。现存的“版权所有”，按印数付酬的办法是很不合理的。在共产主义初级阶段，虽然还不能在一切方面废除资产阶级法权，但必须正视资产阶级法权的影响。
    我们认为降低稿酬以后，不但不会影响作者写作的积极性，而且更有利于作者发挥共产主义的积极性。今天，在哲学社会科学界，广大作者正在纷纷下厂下乡，深入工农；联系实际、改进文风，已经出现了一片新气象。许多人已经订了跃进规划，要像工人农民一样，把自己的劳动生产率大大提高；不但要增加写作的数量，而且更要提高写作的质量。降低稿费的措施，必将大大促进广大作者发挥共产主义的积极性。同时，稿费降低以后，在一定程度上减低了出版物的成本，当然也就会减轻读者的一些负担。这在一方面，有利于扩大发行额和普及文化，受到群众的欢迎，另一方面对作者也是最大的鼓舞。
