Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 3rd: The American "Survival Newspaper" published an editorial entitled "Take Immediate Action to Stop the War!" calling on Americans to take immediate action to stop America's war policy.

The editorial said that the current danger of war requires Americans to take action. Our government leaders must be restrained from taking actions that could irrevocably lead to hydrogen bomb war – the public should speak out loudly to restrain them. The voice should be loud enough that they cannot ignore it. If there was ever a time to do this, it is now.

From a patriotic point of view, the correctness of this attitude is beyond doubt. No one needs to worry about harming their identity as a loyal American by persuading their government or opposing war with communist countries.

Take immediate action to prevent disaster! American authorities are currently openly considering allowing Chiang Kai-shek to bomb mainland China.

The newspaper said: Take immediate action – it is our inescapable duty! To make your actions effective, please notify local newspapers, radio stations, television stations, and officials. This time the press is very willing to pay attention to the protests aroused by Dulles' war movement – this shows the seriousness of the current danger!

### 美“生存报”呼吁美国人民  立即行动起来制止战争

    美“生存报”呼吁美国人民
    立即行动起来制止战争
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国“生存报”以“立即行动起来制止战争！”为题发表社论，要求美国人立即采取行动来制止美国的战争政策。
    社论说，当前的战争危险要求美国人采取行动。必须约束我们的政府领袖，不准他们采取足以无可挽回地导致氢弹战争的行动——公众应该大声疾呼，来约束他们。呼声应该大得使他们无法忽视。如果有什么时候需要这样做的话，那就是现在。
    从爱国主义的观点说来，这种态度的正确性是毫无疑问的。任何人都不必担心由于规劝自己的政府或是反对同共产党国家进行战争，而有损于忠诚的美国人的身分。
    立即行动起来来防止灾难！美国当局目前正在公开地考虑允许蒋介石轰炸中国大陆。
    报纸说：立即行动起来——责无旁贷！为了使你的行动有效，请通知地方报纸、电台、电视台和官员。这一次报界很愿意注意杜勒斯战争运动所激起的抗议——这说明了当前危险的严重性！
