    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Taipei: American aggressors are currently stepping up the arming of Chiang's troops in order to continue military provocations and expand their aggression against China. According to foreign reporters stationed in Taipei, the U.S. "weapon support to the Kuomintang has reached the peak of its original plan." U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group Chief to Taiwan, General Downs, announced at a press conference today that the United States would hand over the missile equipment of the "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion currently stationed in Taiwan to Chiang Kai-shek's army. At the same time, forty-six M-41 tanks were shipped from the United States to Keelung Port in Taiwan today, and more tanks are on their way to Taiwan.
    Not long ago, the United States had already handed over batches of F-86, F-100, C-119 aircraft, and RB-57 jet bombers to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and transported a batch of 155mm howitzers and 8-inch howitzers to Kinmen for Chiang's army. On the 16th, several more ships carrying shells for these cannons were shipped from the United States to Keelung Port.
    The recent frantic arming of Chiang's troops by the United States is related to its attempt to directly intervene in Kinmen and Matsu and expand its aggression against China. Sources indicate that the Chinese people's proposal to peacefully resolve the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu issue has had a far-reaching impact among military and political personnel in Taiwan. This has made the American imperialists, who fear that the world will not be in chaos, very panicked, so they are stepping up the supply of weapons to Chiang Kai-shek's army to encourage them to continue the civil war.
    At the same time, for its own aggressive interests, the United States intends to use increasing the firepower of Chiang's army as bait to induce Chiang Kai-shek to agree to reduce the garrison in Kinmen. An Associated Press report stated, "There are constant indications of emotion among the Kuomintang. If the United States wants to reduce the Kuomintang's forces in Kinmen, it must deal with this emotion." The report said that the recent increase in weapons to Chiang's army is the United States' way of "dealing with this emotion" and "appeasing" the Chiang Kai-shek clique in an attempt to remedy the rift between the U.S. and Chiang.
    Foreign news agencies say that the United States handed over some weapons to Chiang's army only after greatly strengthening the strength of the U.S. forces stationed in Taiwan itself, and that some of the latest weapons are still controlled by the Americans. For example, although Downs has announced that the United States will hand over the missile equipment of the "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion to Chiang's army, it is announced that the actual handover time will be one year later, and without nuclear warheads. In addition, there are reports that the latest weapons such as the U.S. F-104 aircraft "shipped to Taiwan are still controlled by the Americans."

### 安抚蒋介石集团　扩大对我国挑衅  美国加紧装备蒋军

    安抚蒋介石集团　扩大对我国挑衅
    美国加紧装备蒋军
    新华社17日讯　台北消息：美国侵略者最近在加紧装备蒋军，以便继续进行军事挑衅和扩大对中国的侵略活动。据驻台北的外国记者报道，目前，美国“对国民党提供的武器支持已经达到原定计划的顶点”。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团团长窦恩今天在记者招待会上宣布，美国将把目前驻在台湾的“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹营的导弹设备交给蒋介石军队使用。同时，有四十六辆M—41型坦克在今天由美国运到台湾基隆港，还有更多的坦克在向台湾运送途中。
    不久前，美国已经把一批批的F—86型、F—100型、C—119型飞机和RB—57型喷气轰炸机等交给蒋介石集团，并且把一批一五五毫米口径大炮和八英寸口径榴弹炮交给蒋军运往金门。16日，又有几船这些大炮的炮弹由美国运到基隆港口。
    最近美国疯狂武装蒋军，这跟美国企图直接插手金马和扩大侵略中国的阴谋有关。各方消息表明，中国人自己和平解决台、澎、金、马问题的建议，已经在台湾军政人员中间产生深远的影响。这使唯恐天下不乱的美帝国主义者感到十分恐慌，因此加紧把武器供给蒋介石军队，鼓励他们继续进行内战。
    同时，美国为了它的侵略利益，打算以增加蒋军的火力作为钓饵来诱使蒋介石同意减少金门驻军。美联社消息说，“不断有迹象表明国民党人有情绪。如果美国希望减少国民党在金门的兵力，它就必须处理这种情绪。”消息说，最近增加给蒋军武器就是美国要“处理这种情绪”、对蒋介石集团“安抚”一番，以图补救美蒋之间的裂痕。
    外国通讯社说，美国是在大大加强了侵台美军本身的力量以后，才把某一些武器交给蒋军的，而有些最新式的武器一直控制在美国人手里。例如，虽然窦恩已经宣布美国将把“奈克—赫尔克里士”式导弹营的导弹设备交给蒋军，但是据宣布，这些设备实际交给的时间将在一年以后，而且不带核弹头。此外，有消息说，美国F—104式飞机等“运到台湾的最新式武器，目前仍然由美国人控制”。
