The representatives from many provinces and regions at the National Rope Traction Machine On-site Conference held in Nanjing in mid-September all agreed that the double-knife pulley-type deep plough from Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, plows deeply and steadily. If combined with the human and animal-powered rope traction machine equipped with three layers of rollers from Nantong County, it would form a relatively complete set of deep ploughing tools. The Yibin Agricultural Implement Reform Command in Sichuan sent a telegram requesting detailed information on how to manufacture this tool. This is a very good suggestion, and now we are publishing the manufacturing drawings for reference. – Editor

Double-Knife Pulley-Type Deep Plough

This deep plough, in addition to two bamboo knives and an iron ploughshare weighing a little over three catties, is made entirely of miscellaneous wood, with each unit costing 18 yuan to manufacture. It has six major advantages:

I. It can plough to a depth of one and a half to two chi, cutting a width of about eight cun.
II. It does not disrupt the soil layers, facilitating layered fertilization.
III. The furrow is clear, the plough bottom is flat, the soil covering is good, and the clods are fine.
IV. The plough body is stable, and the pulling force is light.
V. The structure is simple, easy to manufacture, and convenient to operate.
VI. It uses little iron, requires little labor, has a low cost, and high efficiency. (Attached picture)

This shows the rope traction machine ploughing the field. By using a rope traction machine and installing adjusting rods with pulleys at both ends of the field, the field can be ploughed back and forth.

If a rope traction machine deep plough and adjusting rod are placed at each end of the field, deep ploughing can be done from both ends, speeding up progress.

Installation of the winch part of the rope traction machine

This is the adjusting rod. Its function is to adjust the tillage rows of the plough and can prevent the movement of the rope traction machine.

    最受欢迎的深耕农具
    9月中旬在南京召开的全国绳索牵引机现场会议上，许多省区的代表都认为江苏南汇县的双刀滑轮式深耕犁耕得深耕得稳，如果加上南通县的装有三层滚柱的人畜力绳索牵引机，就合成一套比较完整的深耕工具。四川宜宾农具改革指挥部来电报要求详细介绍这种工具的制造方法。这个意见很好，现在我们把制造图发表出来，供各地参考。　编者
    双刀滑轮式深耕犁
    这种深耕犁除两把竹刀和一个三斤多重的铁犁头外，全身都是杂树制成的，每部造价值十八元。它有六大优点：
    一、能深耕一尺半到二尺，切泥宽达八寸左右。
    二、不乱土层，便利分层施肥。
    三、犁路清、犁底平，复土好，泥头细。
    四、犁身稳，拉力轻。
    五、结构简单，制造容易，操作方便。
    六、用铁少，花工少，成本低，功效高。（附图片）

     这是绳索牵引机在耕地的情形。用一部绳索牵引机并在田两头都安上调节杆，装上滑轮，就可以来回耕田。
    如在田的两头各放上一部绳索牵引机深耕犁和调节杆，就可以分头深耕，加快进度。
    绳索牵引机绞关部分的装置
    这是调节杆。它的作用是调整犁头耕作的行次，并可以避免绳索牵引机的移动。
