A Word to the Wise

Two One Hundreds
　　
　　A few days ago, while we were compiling the factory history at the Shijingshan Power Plant, we learned something that made people angry and heartbroken: Before liberation, all the machines, tools, and even daily necessities of the power plant were one hundred percent imported. The factory would buy parts from foreign countries for thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan at a time. You see how the working people's wealth, created with blood and sweat, was exploited and squeezed by domestic and foreign capitalists with such viciousness!
　　
　　But now, the factory's recently published small newspaper carried a piece of news reporting that the factory is about to manufacture several units of six kinds of machine tools, including large vertical lathes, multi-drill rod eye beds, shapers, vertical milling machines, pipe cutting lathes, and wood turning lathes, one thousand sets of high-precision ball bearings, and a large 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator...
　　
　　This is a power plant, but also a machine manufacturing plant. This is because after last year's rectification movement, the ideological consciousness of all employees has been greatly improved, and they are full of revolutionary vigor. The original repair workshop has actually long been engaged in manufacturing instead of simply repairing. Not long ago, the workers rushed to manufacture a batch of water turbine generators for the peasant brothers, and now they are going to manufacture large steam turbines. This is something that no one had ever thought of in the past!
　　
　　Now, from any small and precise parts on the machines to the largest and most complex machines, from production to daily necessities, our country can completely manufacture them ourselves, and we no longer need to rely on capitalist countries. We have gone from one hundred percent using imported goods to one hundred percent being able to use domestic goods! These two one hundreds are figures that make the Chinese people happy and the capitalist countries disheartened!

    两个百分之百
    芷汀
    前些天，我们在石景山发电厂编写工厂史的时候，了解到一件叫人生气也叫人痛心的事：解放以前，发电厂的所有机器、工具甚至连日常生活用品，百分之百是进口货。厂里向外国买零件，一买就是几千几万元。你看，劳动人民用血汗创造的财富，被国内外资本家是怎样穷凶极恶地剥削和压榨啊！
    可是现在呢，发电厂不久前出版的小报上刊载了一条消息，报道厂里即将制出大型落地车床、多钻杆眼床、牛头刨床、立铣床、切管车床、镟木车床等六种机床多台，高级精密滚珠轴承一千套，容量一万二千瓩的大型汽轮发电机一台……。
    这里是发电厂，也是机器制造厂。这是经过去年的整风运动，全体职工思想觉悟大大提高，革命干劲十足，原来的修理车间，实际上早已不是单纯修理而搞起制造来了。不久以前，工人们为农民弟兄赶制了一批水轮发电机，现在又要制成大型汽轮机，这真是过去谁也没想到的事！
    现在，厂里所需要的，从机器上的任何细小精密的零件，到最庞大复杂的机器，从生产到生活上需用的东西，我国完全可以自己制造，再也用不着依赖资本主义国家了。我们已经由百分之百的使用进口货达到百分之百的可以使用本国货了！这两个百分之百，是使我国人民为之高兴、使资本主义国家垂头丧气的数字！
