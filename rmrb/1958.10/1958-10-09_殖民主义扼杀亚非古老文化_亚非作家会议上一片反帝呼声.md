Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, October 8th. At the Asian-African Writers' Conference, the plenary session today conducted speeches on the first agenda item. Representatives, starting from the history and current situation of their national literature, condemned the aggression of colonialism and imperialism against the cultures of Asian and African countries.

    Cameroonian representative Matip used rich historical facts to prove that black African culture is one of the oldest cultures of mankind. However, he said sadly, due to the stifling of colonialism, black African people have fallen behind in the development of culture. He pointed out that the colonialists who were driven out of Asia are trying to preserve their shameful rights in Africa. In recent years, imperialists have attempted to turn Africa into their forbidden zone with new slogans and new signboards. Under such circumstances, the role of writers has grown, and economic, cultural, and social realities force writers to struggle from the beginning to liberate their national culture from the shackles of colonialism, to fight for the dignity of the African people, and for the complete liberation of Africa.

    He went on to say that the characteristic of imperialism in cultural aggression is to deny the true culture of the African people and deny its right to exist. African writers have refuted this lie with facts.

    He pointed out that the imperialist acts of aggression in the Suez, Lebanon, and the Taiwan Strait region are desperate struggles to preserve colonial rule throughout Asia and Africa, but the imperialists have never been able to crush the will of the Asian and African people to fight for freedom.

    Burmese representative U Thant narrated the development and characteristics of Burmese literature at the meeting. He said that populism is a characteristic of Burmese literature. During the period of imperialist rule in Burma, they used all their strength to stifle Burmese literature, but Burma still produced many works that united the people of the whole country to fight against imperialism. He said that after Burma's independence, literature has greatly developed.

    Ghanaian representative Sutherland expounded on the significance of the Tashkent conference in strengthening the cooperation of writers from various countries. She said, we have been waiting for such an opportunity for a long time: Asian and African writers meet, discuss issues, and understand each other. She talked about the development of Ghanaian literature, saying that after the people of Ghana gained national independence, they created all the conditions for literary prosperity, and the power of creation has grown.

    Korean representative Han Sorya said at the meeting that we firmly believe that this meeting can unite the strength of the people in order to carry out a sacred struggle—against colonialism and against imperialism. He talked about the development of Korean literature, saying that Korean literature occupies an important position in Eastern culture.

    Representatives from Indonesia, Ceylon, Mongolia, Cambodia, the Philippines, India, and China also spoke at the meeting today.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, October 7th. The Asian-African Writers' Book Exhibition, held during the Asian-African Writers' Conference, opened here today.

    The exhibition is located in the twelve spacious lounges of the Navoi Theater. The exhibition displays more than 3,000 volumes of books of various genres from Asian and African countries and the Asian parts of the Soviet Union.

    殖民主义扼杀亚非古老文化
    亚非作家会议上一片反帝呼声
    新华社塔什干8日电　亚非作家会议全体会议今天就第一项议程进行发言。代表们从本国文学的历史和现状出发，谴责殖民主义和帝国主义对亚非国家文化的侵略。
    喀麦隆代表马梯普用丰富的历史事实证明黑非洲文化是人类最古老的文化之一。但是，他沉痛地说，由于殖民主义的扼杀，黑非洲人民在文化的发展中落后了。他指出，被亚洲赶出来的殖民主义者企图在非洲保存自己的可耻的权利，近年来，帝国主义企图用新的口号和新的招牌把非洲变成自己的禁区。在这种情况下，作家的作用增长了，经济、文化和社会现实迫使作家一开始就为了使自己民族的文化从殖民主义的桎梏下解放出来而斗争，为非洲人民的人格和为完全解放非洲而斗争。
    他接着说，帝国主义在文化侵略上的特点是否认非洲人民的真正文化，否认它存在的权利。非洲作家们已用事实驳斥了这种谎言。
    他指出，帝国主义在苏伊士、黎巴嫩和中国台湾海峡地区的侵略行为，是企图在整个亚洲和非洲保存殖民统治的绝望的挣扎，但是帝国主义者从来不能够粉碎亚非人民争取自由的意志。
    缅甸代表吴塔侬在会上叙述了缅甸文学的发展和特点。他说，人民性是缅甸文学的特点。帝国主义在缅甸统治期间，用尽一切力量扼杀缅甸的文学，但是缅甸仍然产生了很多作品，这些作品团结了全国人民进行反对帝国主义的斗争。他说，缅甸在独立以后，文学获得了很大的发展。
    加纳代表萨特兰在会上阐述了塔什干会议对于加强各国作家合作的意义。她说，我们很久就等待着这样的机会：亚非各国作家见面，讨论问题，进行互相了解。她谈到加纳文学的发展说，加纳人民获得了民族独立以后，创造了文学繁荣的一切条件，创作的力量增长起来了。
    朝鲜代表韩雪野在会上讲话说，我们坚决相信这次会议能够团结人民的力量，以便进行神圣的斗争——反对殖民主义和反对帝国主义。他谈到了朝鲜文学的开展，他说，朝鲜文学在东方文化中占有重要的地位。
    今天在会上讲话的还有印度尼西亚、锡兰、蒙古、柬埔寨、菲律宾、印度和中国的代表等。
    新华社塔什干7日电　在亚非作家会议期间举办的亚非作家书籍展览会，今天在这里开幕。
    展览会设在纳沃伊剧院的十二个宽敞的休息室内。展览会共展出了亚非各国以及苏联亚洲部分各共和国的各种体裁的书籍三千多卷。大量的小说、诗集和论文集，生动地显示了亚非人民的文化面貌。
    展览会有一个专门的大厅展出中国、阿联、日本、柬埔寨、加纳、苏丹、安哥拉等国的作家赠给会议的书籍。
