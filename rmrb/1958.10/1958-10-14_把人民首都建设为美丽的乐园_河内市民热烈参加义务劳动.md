Building the People's Capital into a Beautiful Paradise
Hanoi Citizens Enthusiastically Participate in Voluntary Labor

    The people of all strata in Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, enthusiastically participate in the patriotic labor emulation drive to build the capital. The third session of the Hanoi Municipal People's Council recently passed a resolution requiring workers, staff, cadres, troops, and citizens to participate in voluntary labor for half a day to two or three days each month.
    The Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee recently announced the urban construction plan to the citizens. The plan includes the construction of a medium-sized water conservancy irrigation system in the suburbs of Hanoi. Once completed, it will ensure sufficient water for tens of thousands of hectares of early and late rice crops.
    The plan also includes the construction of the Bay Mau Lake park area covering 54 hectares within three to five years. It will include a museum, a cultural palace, a youth club, a sports field, a theater, and a worker's sanatorium. In addition, the Truc Bach Lake area will be renovated into a modern park; this year, the scenic West Lake embankment road will be widened, and a small garden will be built on the lakeside.
    The plan requires the construction of a residential area for the working people covering 28 hectares and many public bathhouses. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) (Attached photo)

    把人民首都建设为美丽的乐园
    河内市民热烈参加义务劳动
    越南民主共和国首都河内各阶层人民，热烈地参加建设首都的爱国劳动竞赛。河内市人民议会第三次会议最近作出了决议，要求工人、职员、机关干部、部队和市民每月分别参加半天到两三天不等的义务劳动。
    河内市行政委员会最近已经向市民们公布了首都市政建设的规划。规划包括，在河内市郊修筑中型水利灌溉系统。它建成以后，将保证成万公顷面积的早稻和晚稻获得足够的水。
    规划还包括，在三年到五年内，建成一个占地五十四公顷的七母湖公园区。其中有博物馆、文化宫、少年俱乐部、运动场、戏院和工人疗养院等。另外，还把竹白湖区修饰成一座现代化公园；今年内要把风景如画的西湖堤道路加宽，并且在湖滨修起一个小花园。
    规划要求建筑一个占地二十八公顷的劳动人民住宅区和许多公共澡堂。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
