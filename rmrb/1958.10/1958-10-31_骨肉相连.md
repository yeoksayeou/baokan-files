    Flesh and Blood Connection
    Lin Wenbiao
    "Everyone, what are we six young lads?!" That was just how Factory Director Lu of the machine repair shop was; he always said this at unusual times.
    "Young lads, we are tigers!" Everyone answered loudly in unison.
    "Good! Everyone, there's a battle to fight! This battle is no simple matter. What do you say, can you guarantee the production of ten sweet potato slicing machines, five sweet potato grinding machines, and five sweet potato strip cutting machines in four days, plus four carpenters?"
    "Yes!" Only two people shouted "Yes," the rest looked at each other. Regarding these three types of sweet potato processing machines, none of them had ever touched them before. Two of them used to repair machines in the factory, and the other four were just transferred from the rice milling workshop of the parent factory—the rice mill. This satellite factory had just been set up for less than a month. Besides an old lathe, there were only some hammers, pliers, and other scattered small tools, not to mention any steel raw materials.
    "You two who said 'Yes,' how exactly can you 'Yes'?"
    "We can, we just have to find a way," the two young lads replied.
    "What way?"
    "Ways are thought up by people, we need everyone to think together."
    This made everyone laugh. Factory Director Lu said, "Everyone, don't laugh, they're right. Everyone listen to me explain how this task was accepted, and then you will rack your brains to find a way..."
      "Yesterday evening, I happened to run into my old friend Yang Jincai on the street, who used to work in a rice mill and is now the head of the Tong'an Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative. This year, a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes is expected, and the sweet potato processing problem is very urgent. For a month, he has run all over six counties and cities, running into walls everywhere. He came to Xiamen City, but the task schedules in the various machine factories in Xiamen City were packed solid, and he still came up empty.
    The moment he saw me, it was like meeting a great savior. But how could he know that we were willing but unable? I laid my cards on the table. When he heard this, he was greatly disappointed and wanted to rush back that night. I insisted on keeping him for the night, but he kept tossing and turning... I thought about it. According to what he said, these processing machines are not too complex in structure and don't use much iron. Although it's difficult for us, what is the Great Leap Forward without difficulties? If we don't find a way to support our farmer brothers, what kind of workers are we! So I agreed.
    "That's right, you were right to agree! Let's assign the tasks," everyone requested in unison. No sooner said than done: designing, making molds, looking for iron materials, ....
    By the afternoon of the fourth day, only two sweet potato strip cutting machines had not been completed yet. Little Guo hummed a tuneless song, which was immediately sung by everyone:
    "Six young lads, work with the energy of tigers;
    Twisted into one strand, can run while carrying a mountain.
    Supporting the agricultural cooperative, hearts are burning hot;
    Workers and peasants hand in hand, soaring through the clouds and mist."
    Everyone was singing and working when they saw five flatbed carts coming from the north side of the road. Factory Director Lu recognized Yang, the head of the cooperative, at the head of the first cart at a glance. He ran out like he was flying, and the first thing he said was: "We can finish everything ahead of schedule this afternoon." He looked at the black stones loaded on the cart and immediately recognized them as emery sand. He couldn't help but shout out: "Ah! Precious treasure!" Then he asked, "Old Yang, where did this treasure come from? Did you bring it here to sell?"
    "A mountain forty miles away from our cooperative is full of this treasure. The day before yesterday, ten of us went and dug up this little bit to give to you."
    "Give it to us! How did you know we were looking for this treasure everywhere?"
    "Didn't you tell me that night that you were setting up a satellite emery factory?"
    As Old Yang spoke, he personally hung a brocade banner with the words "Flesh and Blood Connection" written on it in the middle of the factory wall, causing the whole hall to glow red.

    骨肉相连
    林文彪
    “大伙们，咱们六个年青小伙子是什么？！”机器修配厂的陆厂长就是这么个脾气；他讲这句话，总是在不寻常的时候。
    “小伙子，是猛虎！”大伙齐声响亮地回答。
    “好！大伙们，有仗打了！这个仗不简单，你们说，四天内保证制造出十台地瓜切片机，五架地瓜磨粉机，五部地瓜削条机，加上四个木工，能不能？”
    “能！”喊“能”的只有两个人，其余几个都面面相觑。关于这三种地瓜加工机，大家都从来没摸过，他们当中两个人过去在厂里修理机器，其他的四个都是刚从母厂——碾米厂碾米车间调出来的。这个卫星厂的炉灶刚搭起来不到一个月。除了一部旧车床以外，别的就是一些锤子、钳子之类的零星小工具，更不用说什么钢铁原料了。
    “你们两个说‘能’，到底怎么‘能’法子？”
    “能，就是要想办法。”两个小伙子回答说。
    “什么办法呢？”
    “办法是人想出来的，要大伙来想。”
    这么一说引得大伙都笑了。陆厂长说：“大伙们，不要笑，他们说的对。大家听我说说这个任务是怎么接受下来的，就会破开脑袋想办法了……”
      “昨天傍晚我在街上偶然碰到过去曾经在一个碾米厂里做过工的老朋友杨金才，他现在是同安曙光农业社的社长。今年地瓜丰收在望，地瓜加工问题非常紧迫。一个月来他跑遍了六个县、市，到处都碰了壁，又跑到厦门市来，而厦门市各个机器厂里任务挤得滴水不漏，还是落空了。
    他一碰到我，就像遇得一个大救星。可是他哪儿知道咱们心有余力不足，我摊了牌，他听了大失所望，连夜要赶回去，我强留他住一夜，可是他躺着一直翻来复去……。我想了想，根据他说的这些加工机构造不太复杂，用铁也不多，虽然对我们来说有困难，但是没有困难算什么跃进啦，不想办法支援农民兄弟，还算什么工人呢！于是我就答应了。
    “对，答应得对！分配任务吧。”大伙不约而同地这样要求。说干就干：设计的设计，做模的做模，找铁料的找铁料，……。
    到第四天下午，只差两架地爪削条机还没有搞好了。小郭顺口哼了一首没谱的歌，马上被大家都唱上了：
    “六个小伙子，干劲赛猛虎；
    拧成一条线，背山能跑步。
    支援农业社，心头热呼呼；
    工农手携手，腾云又驾雾。”
    大家正在边干边唱，却见马路北方来了五架板车。陆厂长一眼就认出第一轮板车把头的是杨社长。他飞似地跑出去，劈头第一句就是：“下午就可以全部提前造好。”看了车上装的是黑黑的石头，一眼就看出是金钢沙，不禁喊出：“啊！好宝贝！”接着问：“老杨，这宝贝是哪儿来的，是运来卖的吗？”
    “离我们社四十里外的一座山上尽是这个宝贝，我们前天去了十个人，挖了这么点，送给你们。”
    “给我们的啊！你怎么知道我们正到处寻找这宝贝呢？”
    “你那一天晚上不是向我介绍了你们办一个金钢沙的卫星厂吗？”
    老杨说着，把一面上面写着“骨肉相连”的锦旗亲手挂在厂房的墙壁中间，使满堂发着红光。
