Vigorously Build Militia Divisions
Fu Qiutao

After Chairman Mao inspected several provinces in the Yangtze River basin in September and returned to Beijing, he said, "The organization of militia divisions is very good and should be promoted." He also instructed, "The imperialists are bullying us so much that this needs to be seriously dealt with. We must not only have a strong regular army, but also vigorously build militia divisions." The people of the whole country warmly support Chairman Mao's great call. Simultaneously with the vigorous development of the people's commune movement, a mass movement of arming the entire population and vigorously building militia divisions has been launched. Especially after the widespread development of the struggle of the entire people against U.S. imperialism's occupation of our country's Taiwan, this movement has been like ten thousand horses galloping, advancing a thousand miles a day. In just one month, most provinces and cities have realized the arming of the entire population. For example, in Beijing, 156 militia divisions and 356 militia regiments were organized in less than a month; Jiangsu Province organized 185 militia divisions and more than 2,400 militia regiments; Guangxi organized 224 militia divisions and more than 2,400 militia regiments. At present, the organizational work of militia divisions and regiments in various places is developing rapidly. After being organized, they all implement militarized organization, combat-ready action, and collectivized life. They adopt the communist method of large-scale collaboration, carry forward the fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army, vigorously engage in steelmaking, deep plowing, and make a great revolution in culture and technology. Based on the principle of combining labor and military affairs, they carry out rich and colorful mass amateur military training activities. Many militia divisions and regiments on the Fujian front produce while supporting the front, digging trenches, transporting shells, and cooperating with the People's Liberation Army to fight and strike at the enemy. Militiamen in Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, sing such war songs heroically: "Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, twist into one rope; in peacetime, we engage in production; in wartime, we kill the enemy. The waves roar, the wind howls, the anger of 600 million people burns. The U.S. imperialists invade our territory; this hatred will not be avenged unless it's extinguished." In order to promptly summarize and exchange advanced experiences, the General Staff Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a national on-the-spot conference on militia work at the Shijingshan Power Plant, Steel Plant, Beijing Institute of Technology, and Xushui County, Hebei, from October 7th to 18th. The comrades attending the meeting unanimously believed that implementing the arming of the entire population and vigorously building militia divisions is a great embodiment of Chairman Mao's military thought on people's war and an important measure for the liberated 600 million Chinese people to carry out great socialist construction and transition to communism.

In the vigorous building of militia divisions, all localities have fully utilized our Party's experience in building the People's Liberation Army and the working methods of leading mass movements to carry out work, and have already explored many good experiences, which are:

	1. Party Committee Leadership, Politics in Command. The militia division is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization. It is closely related to the entire national economy and the interests of the people. Vigorously building militia divisions is a huge mass military, political, and organizational task. Many Party committee secretaries personally took charge, such as Liu Xuechu, Secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Institute of Technology; Ai Zhisheng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Tsinghua University; Li Ximing, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shijingshan Power Plant; Gu Shoumin, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Shijingshan Steel Plant; Zhang Guozhong, Secretary of the Xushui County Party Committee; Chen Zhenhua, Secretary of the Party Committee of Suicheng People's Commune in Xushui County; and Zhan Dengke, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shangzhuang People's Commune. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, closely integrate production, work, and study, adopt the democratic method of large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions, vigorously and unreservedly mobilize the masses, and carry out organizational establishment on the basis of raising the political consciousness of the masses. All militia work is under the unified leadership and arrangement of the Party committees of factories, mines, schools, organs, or people's communes. All work emphasizes taking care of the overall situation and following the mass line. The mass line is the fundamental line of our Party and also the fundamental line of our conscription construction. Only by treating the masses with a truly equal attitude, consulting with the masses in everything, being good at coming from the masses and going to the masses, giving play to the wisdom of the masses, and mobilizing the positive factors of the masses can we better implement the Party's policies in militia work and effectively prevent coercion, commandism, formalism, and the tendency to deviate from the masses.

	2. Implement the Class Line. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have undergone more than 20 years of armed struggle and the education of a series of political movements since liberation, and their political awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Now they are closely united around Party committees and governments at all levels, holding high the banner of Chairman Mao and advancing victoriously. However, within our country, class enemies still exist, and we should be highly vigilant. In the movement to vigorously build militia divisions, class enemies at home and abroad will carry out sabotage. Therefore, in the militia organization work, all localities have paid attention to review work and implemented the class line. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists must not be allowed to mix into the militia ranks to ensure the purity of this armed force. The weapons of the militia should be carefully controlled by reliable militiamen, and militiamen should be educated to pay attention to cherish and preserve weapons. Militia cadres are selected from demobilized and transferred military personnel, workers, peasants, and students who are excellent Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members to serve as cadres, ensuring the absolute leadership of the Party over the militia organization. Each level of Party committee in Xushui County has a military department, i.e., an armed forces department. The Party committee secretary and branch secretary concurrently serve as political commissar, instructor, and guidance officer of the militia division, regiment, battalion, and company. The grassroots organizations of the militia rely on the active leading role of Party and League members to implement the Party's policies and lines.

	3. Grasp the Principle of Adapting to Local Conditions and Times. Our country has a vast territory and a large population. Cities and villages are different, and the working conditions in each region are different. Therefore, all localities conduct the organizational work of militia divisions in different regions and different units, grasping the principle of adapting to local conditions and times. In rural areas, many regions take the people's commune as a unit, and are organized into divisions, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and squads, or large, medium, and small teams, according to the production organization and the number of militiamen. In cities, factories, mines, schools, and organs are taken as units, or urban people's communes are taken as units, and organized according to the conditions of production, work, and study. For example, the organization of the people's militia regiment and battalion of Shijingshan Power Plant is combined with workshops, work sections, and shifts. The militia organization work in ethnic minority areas can be carried out gradually according to needs and possibilities.

	4. Adhere to the Principle of Combining Labor and Military Affairs. After hundreds of millions of people are organized, they actively invest in steelmaking, ironmaking, autumn harvesting and planting, deep plowing of land, and various production and construction projects. For example, militia comrades Guo Guangju and Pu Cunhui (female) of the Ironmaking Department of Shijingshan Steel Plant used their spare time to design and prepare materials, and after 20 days of hard work, built a native-foreign combination blast furnace with a daily output of 60 tons of pig iron. It was put into production on September 23, and it is expected to produce more than 7,000 tons of iron by the end of the year. More than 12,000 militiamen in the Dawangdian Commune of Xushui County built 4,850 earthen ironmaking furnaces in one day and night. The militia has played a great role on various production fronts and work posts. At the same time, all localities have implemented the principle of combining labor and military affairs, carrying out political education and military training to improve the political awareness and military knowledge of the militia. Of course, during the three years of hard work, all training work should be somewhat flexible and should be combined with production to promote production. Train as much as can be trained. The training method should rely on demobilized and retired soldiers as the backbone, widely mobilize the masses, and adopt the method of guaranteed teaching and learning. In addition to universally learning shooting and utilizing terrain and terrain features, the content of military training should also combine the professional nature of their respective work, production, and study, and learn the military knowledge of special arms in a planned way according to possible conditions. The training work should carry forward the excellent tradition of the People's Liberation Army of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and officers and soldiers teaching each other, and combine the training work with cultural and sports activities in a rich and colorful way, making it a regular cultural entertainment and sports activity for the people.

	5. Grasp the Backbone, Grasp Typical Examples. The backbone of the militia is the basic militia, and the backbone of the basic militia is the demobilized and transferred military personnel. The vast majority of more than six million demobilized and transferred military personnel have undergone long-term education and arduous combat tests by the Party, have a high political awareness, rich work experience, and strong organizational discipline. Therefore, in the work of organizing militia divisions, all localities rely on demobilized and transferred military personnel as the backbone, strengthen their education, rely on them as teachers to train the militia in peacetime, and rely on them as grassroots cadres to form troops in wartime. Grasping the strength of demobilized and transferred military personnel and giving play to their backbone role in production, education, learning, and the struggle against the enemy is of great importance for implementing the Party's policies, creating advanced typical examples, setting up benchmarks, planting red flags, and promoting work. The experience of Suicheng People's Commune in Xushui County proves that the better the work in the village, the more inseparable it is from the backbone role of demobilized and transferred military personnel. Demobilized and transferred military personnel account for 48% of the cadres such as the branch secretaries and battalion commanders in the whole commune.

	6. Strengthen Political Work and Implement the Glorious Tradition Education of the People's Liberation Army. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army serves the people wholeheartedly and has the fine traditions and work style of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, unity between the army and the people, unity between the army and the government, and military democracy, political democracy, economic democracy, observing discipline, obeying orders, sacrificing oneself for the public, being selfless, being simple and hardworking, and fighting heroically. We must implement this excellent tradition into the work of arming the entire population, strengthen political work, break down individualism and departmentalism, establish collectivism and communist ideology, implement the communist style of "pulling out white flags and planting red flags," constantly criticize various bad ideological work styles, and mobilize the masses to continuously struggle against various enemies. Fully utilize various mass gatherings, civil schools, dramas, movies, poems, pictures, and other forms to implement communism, patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism education.

	7. The Army Has Done a Tremendous Job in Arming the Entire Population. Our country's militia organization has continuously developed and grown stronger with the strong help of the People's Liberation Army. The powerful militia organization is not only a powerful assistant to the People's Liberation Army, but also a deep source for the People's Liberation Army to obtain continuous replenishment and expansion. In the current movement to vigorously build militia divisions, the People's Liberation Army is vigorously assisting local Party committees and local military organs from the aspects of manpower and material resources to organize, train, and educate the militia well, and further strengthen the relationship between the army and the people. For example, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, has transferred a large number of cadres to help Xushui County train the militia. During the training process, the troops' cadres eat, live, and work with the militia, which has a very good impact on the militia. The People's Liberation Army on Nanri Island, Fujian Province, has actively helped the local militia train many all-round gunners to jointly strike at the enemy who dares to invade.

Judging from the situation reflected in various places, the organization of the militia division is very good, and it has a far-reaching impact and a great role on the country's economic construction, national defense construction, and the change of people's political and ideological outlook: (1) It can embolden, boost morale, strengthen the prestige of the people, and destroy the arrogance of the enemy; enhance the people's spirit of striving for self-improvement, daring to despise all class enemies at home and abroad, and daring to ask high mountains to bow their heads and rivers to give way; (2) It can not only accumulate hundreds of millions of reserve soldiers with high political awareness and military literacy, but also cultivate tens of millions of reserve officers with various talents, fundamentally solving the contradiction of having fewer soldiers in peacetime and more soldiers in wartime; (3) Internally, it can effectively control landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship; externally, it can effectively defend against aggression, and when imperialists invade our country, it will make it difficult for them to move an inch and finally drown them in the sea of our entire people being soldiers;
(4) It can establish a unified, command-as-you-like, and democratic centralism-implementing labor organization, scientifically allocate labor, improve the labor efficiency of the people, and promote the great leap forward in production; (5) It can enhance the people's organization, discipline, and combat effectiveness;
(6) It can cultivate the communist style of the people through militarized organization, combat-ready action, collectivized life, and the supply system of life; (7) It can further carry forward the fine tradition of hard work of the People's Liberation Army, and enhance the firm will of the broad masses of the people to not be afraid of difficulties, not be afraid of dangers, and be unyielding; (8) It can effectively carry out mass cultural, sports, and martial arts activities, enhance the people's physique, and promote scientific and cultural revolution;
(9) It can cultivate all-rounders who are capable in both writing and martial arts, workers when entering factories, farmers when going to the fields, literati when taking up pens, and soldiers when taking up guns, becoming all-round talents who are both red and expert; (10) It can further strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, making them as close as flesh and blood; (11) It can twist workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers together, consolidate unity around the Party and Chairman Mao, and facilitate the implementation of the Party's various policies and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way; (12) It enables everyone to participate in economic construction and national defense construction, and the entire national economy can implement the principle of peacetime civilian use and wartime military use in many aspects. In peacetime, large-scale production and construction are carried out in a planned way. Once the imperialists attack, the entire people can calmly and in an organized way turn to war mobilization. The national economy can be transformed into a wartime economy in a timely manner, supporting the anti-aggression war from all aspects and striving for the final victory of the war.

The superiority of vigorously building militia divisions has been grasped by the broad masses of the people. In the movement of arming the entire population, the masses in various places are producing while practicing martial arts, holding their heads high and chests out, with high morale. Everywhere is filled with joy, and everywhere you can hear the people's singing. The workers of Shijingshan Steel Plant praise it like this:

	"Steel worker militia regiment,
	Production and combat are at the forefront;
	Assaulting production is an expert,
	Combat wants to be a hero;
	If the enemy dares to invade,
	We will surely eliminate it completely!"

The members of the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County praise the arming of the entire population like this:

	"Speaking of militarization, everyone praises it,
	The whole people are soldiers, and women also participate,
	Learn military affairs in the morning, and learn culture in the evening;
	Politics and technology, study it together;
	Go to the fields when the whistle sounds, cheer and go to work,
	Production is like combat, everyone is full of energy;
	Grain is 10,000 catties per mu, supporting industrialization;
	Training to become literate and martial, everything can be done;
	Can produce with a hoe, and kill the enemy with a gun,
	If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade, send them back home."

The student militia of Renmin University wrote like this:

	"Workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers are all armed,
	The commander is the Communist Party,
	American jackals get out,
	Otherwise, eat an iron slap."

The militia of the Capital Organ Militia Division praised the benefits of the militia division like this:

	"The organization of the organ militia is good,
	Literary and military talents show their heroes,
	Work and military training are combined,
	Peaceful construction is even higher.
	The will to liberate Taiwan is firm,
	Confidence in defending peace is high,
	If the U.S. imperialists dare to challenge fire,
	Tighten the noose and never spare them."

    大办民兵师
    傅秋涛
    毛主席在9月间巡视了长江流域的几个省回京后说：“民兵师的组织很好，应当推广”。并指示：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。”全国人民热烈拥护毛主席这个伟大的号召，在人民公社化运动蓬勃发展的同时，掀起了全民皆兵、大办民兵师的群众运动，特别是全民反对美帝国主义侵占我国台湾的斗争广泛开展之后，这个运动，犹如万马奔腾、一日千里，短短一个月，多数省市已实现了全民皆兵。如北京市，不到一个月，就组织了一百五十六个民兵师，三百五十六个民兵团；江苏省组织了一百八十五个民兵师，二千四百多个民兵团；广西　组织了二百二十四个民兵师，二千四百多个民兵团。目前各地民兵师团的组织工作，发展很快。组织起来之后，都实行组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化，采取共产主义的大协作方法，以人民解放军的战斗精神，大搞钢铁，深翻土地，大闹文化革命和技术革命，并本着劳武结合的原则，开展丰富多彩的群众性的业余练武活动。在福建前线的许多民兵师团，一边生产，一边支前，挖战壕，运炮弹，配合人民解放军作战，打击敌人。在福建省连江县民兵则雄赳赳的唱出这样的战歌：“工农商学兵，拧成一股绳，平时闹生产，战时杀敌人，浪在吼、风在啸，六亿人民怒火烧，美帝侵略我领土，此仇不报恨不消”。中国人民解放军总参谋部，为及时总结和交流先进经验，于10月7日至18日，在北京石景山发电厂、钢铁厂、北京工业学院、河北徐水县召开了全国民兵工作现场会议，到会同志一致认为，实行全民皆兵、大办民兵师，是毛主席人民战争军事思想的伟大体现，是解放了的六万万中国人民进行伟大的社会主义建设和向共产主义过渡的一项重要措施。
    在大办民兵师中，各地都充分运用我们党建设人民解放军的经验和领导群众运动的工作方法来进行工作，并且已经摸索出了许多好经验，这就是：
    一、党委领导，政治挂帅。民兵师是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织，它与整个国民经济和人民群众利益是息息相关的。大办民兵师，是一项巨大的群众性的军事工作、政治工作和组织工作。许多党委书记都亲自挂帅，如北京工业学院党委书记刘雪初、清华大学党委副书记艾知生、石景山发电厂党委书记李锡铭、石景山钢铁厂党委副书记谷受民、徐水县县委书记张国忠、徐水县遂城人民公社党委书记陈振华、商庄人民公社党委书记詹登科等同志都亲自掌握这项工作。在党委统一领导下，紧紧结合生产、工作和学习，采用大鸣、大放、大辩论的民主方法，轰轰烈烈，放手发动群众，在提高群众政治觉悟的基础上，进行组织编制。各项民兵工作，都由工厂、矿山、学校、机关或人民公社党委统一领导和安排，一切工作强调照顾全局，走群众路线。群众路线，是我们党的根本路线，也是我们兵役建设的根本路线，只有用真正平等的态度对待群众，凡事与群众商量，善于从群众中来到群众中去，发挥群众的智慧，调动群众的积极因素，才能在民兵工作中更好地贯彻党的政策，有效地防止强迫命令、形式主义和脱离群众的倾向。
    二、贯彻阶级路线。我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，经过了二十多年的武装斗争锻炼和解放以来一系列的政治运动教育，政治觉悟空前提高；现在又紧紧团结在各级党委和政府的周围，高举着毛主席的旗帜胜利前进。但是，在我们国家内部，阶级敌人仍然存在，我们应有高度的警惕。在大办民兵师运动中，国内外的阶级敌人是会进行破坏的。因此，在民兵组织工作中，各地都注意了审查工作，贯彻了阶级路线，凡是地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子、右派分子都不能让他混入民兵队伍之内，保证这支武装部队的纯洁。民兵的武器，注意掌握在可靠的民兵手里，并教育民兵注意爱护和保管武器。对民兵干部，都是从复员转业军人、工人、农民、学生中选择优秀的共产党员、共青团员来担任，保证党对民兵组织的绝对领导。徐水县各级党委会都设有军事部即武装部，党委书记、支部书记兼民兵师、团、营、连的政委、教导员、指导员；民兵的基层组织都依靠党团员的积极带头作用，贯彻执行党的政策、路线。
    三、掌握因时因地制宜的原则。我国地广、人多，城市与乡村不同，各地区的工作情况又不一样。因此，各地对民兵师的组织工作，都分别不同的地区、不同的单位来进行，掌握了因时因地制宜的原则。在农村中，许多地区都是以人民公社为单位，并根据生产组织和民兵多少，编为师、团、营、连、排、班，或者大、中、小队。在城市中，以工厂、矿山、学校和机关为单位，或以城市人民公社为单位，根据生产、工作和学习的情况来编组，如石景山发电厂的兵民团、营等组织，就是与车间、工段和班次相结合。在少数民族地区的民兵组织工作，可根据需要与可能，逐步进行。
    四、坚持劳武结合的原则。亿万人民组织起来之后，都积极投入了炼钢、炼铁、秋收秋种、深翻土地和各项生产建设中去，如石景山钢铁厂炼铁部郭光巨、蒲存惠（女）等民兵同志，利用业余时间设计、备料，经过二十天苦战，兴建一座日产六十吨生铁的土洋结合的高炉，9月23日投入生产，预计年底可产生铁七千多吨。徐水县大王店公社一万两千多名民兵一昼夜建起炼铁土炉四千八百五十个。民兵在各个生产战线和工作岗位上都发挥了很大作用。同时，各地还贯彻了劳武结合的原则，进行政治教育和军事训练，提高民兵的政治觉悟和军事知识。当然，在苦干三年期间，一切训练工作，要有所灵活，要结合生产，促进生产，能训练多少就训练多少。训练方式，应当依靠复员退伍军人作骨干，广泛发动群众，采取包教保学的办法进行。军事训练的内容，除了普遍学会射击和利用地形地物的科目之外，不同的单位，还应当结合各自的工作、生产和学习的专业性质，根据可能条件，有计划地学习特种兵的军事知识。训练工作，要发扬人民解放军的官教兵、兵教官、官兵互教的优良传统，要把训练工作和文化体育活动结合起来，丰富多彩，使它成为人民群众经常的文化娱乐和体育活动的内容。
    五、抓骨干，抓典型。民兵的骨干是基干民兵，而基干民兵的骨干又是复员转业军人。六百多万复员转业军人，绝大多数经过党的长期教育和艰苦战斗考验，政治觉悟较高，工作经验较丰富，组织纪律性较强。因此，各地在组建民兵师工作中，都是依靠复员转业军人作骨干，加强对他们的教育，平时依靠他们作为训练民兵的教员，战时就依靠他们作为组建部队的基层干部。抓紧复员转业军人这支力量，发挥他们在生产上、教育上、学习上以及对敌斗争中的骨干作用，对于贯彻执行党的政策，创造先进典型，立标兵，插红旗，推动工作是有重大作用的，徐水县遂城人民公社的经验证明，凡是工作较好的村庄，都是和复员转业军人的骨干作用分不开的，在全社的支书、营长等干部中，复员转业军人就占了48％。
    六、加强政治工作，贯彻人民解放军的光荣传统教育。人民解放军在党中央和毛主席的直接领导下，全心全意为人民服务，有官兵一致、上下一致、军民一致、军政一致和军事民主、政治民主、经济民主、守纪律、听指挥、舍己为群、大公无私、艰苦朴素、英勇战斗的优良传统和作风。我们要把这种优良传统贯彻到全民皆兵工作中去，加强政治工作，大破个人主义和本位主义，大立集体主义和共产主义思想，贯彻“拔白旗、插红旗”的共产主义风格，不断批判各种不良思想作风，发动群众不断与各种敌人进行斗争。充分运用各种群众集会、民校、戏剧、电影、诗歌、图片等多种形式，贯彻共产主义、爱国主义、国际主义和革命英雄主义教育。
    七、军队在全民皆兵中作了巨大的工作。我国的民兵组织，是在人民解放军的大力帮助下不断发展和壮大起来的。强大的民兵组织，不仅成为人民解放军的有力助手，而且成为人民解放军获得不断的补充和扩大的深厚泉源。在目前大办民兵师运动中，人民解放军都从人力物力等方面，大力协助地方党委和地方军事机关，把民兵组织好，训练好，教育好，进一步密切军民关系。如驻在河北保定专区的人民解放军，就抽调大批干部，帮助徐水县进行训练民兵；在训练过程中，部队干部与民兵同吃、同住、同劳动，给民兵影响很好。在福建省南日岛的人民解放军，就积极帮助当地民兵训练了许多全能炮手，共同打击敢于侵犯的敌人。
    从目前各地反映的情况来看，民兵师的组织很好，它对于国家的经济建设、国防建设和人民的政治思想面貌的改变都有着深远的影响和伟大的作用：（1）它可以壮胆、壮气，长人民的威风，灭敌人的气焰；增强人民发奋图强的精神，敢于蔑视国内外一切阶级敌人，敢于要高山低头、河水让路；（2）它不但可以积蓄亿万的具有高度政治觉悟和军事素养的后备兵员，而且可以培养数千万具有各种才能的预备役军官，从根本上解决平时养兵少、战时用兵多的矛盾；（3）它对内可以有效地控制地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子、右派分子，巩固无产阶级专政；对外，可以有力地防御侵略，当帝国主义侵犯我们祖国的时候，就使他们寸步难行，最后淹死在我全民皆兵大海里；
  （4）它可以建立统一的、指挥如意的、贯彻民主集中制的劳动组织，科学地调配劳动力，提高人民的劳动效率，促进生产大跃进；（5）它可以增强人民的组织性、纪律性和战斗性；
  （6）它可以通过组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化和供给制的生活，培养人民的共产主义风格；（7）它可以进一步发扬人民解放军艰苦奋斗的优良传统，增强广大人民的不畏困难、不怕艰险、百折不挠的坚毅意志；（8）它可以有效地开展群众性的文化、体育和练武活动，增强人民的体质，促进科学文化革命；
  （9）它可以培养能文、能武的多面手，进工厂是工人，下田是农民，拿笔是文人，拿枪是军人，成为又红又专的全面人材；（10）它可以进一步密切军队和人民的关系，使之如骨肉一样亲密团结；（11）它可以把工、农、商、学、兵拧在一起，巩固团结在党和毛主席的周围，便于贯彻执行党的各项政策，多快好省地建设社会主义；（12）它使人人参加经济建设，人人参加国防建设，整个国民经济能从多方面贯彻平时民用、战时军用的原则，平时有计划地大搞生产建设，一旦帝国主义袭击时，全民可以从容地有组织地转入战争动员状态，国民经济可以及时转化为战时经济，从各方面支援反侵略战争，争取战争的最后胜利。
    大办民兵师的优越性，已为广大人民所掌握。在全民皆兵的运动中，各地群众都是一面生产，一面练武，昂首挺胸，斗志风发，到处是一片喜气洋洋，到处可以听到人民的歌颂。石景山钢铁厂的工人是这样的歌颂它：
        “钢铁工人民兵团，
        生产战斗都当先；
        突击生产是能手，
        战斗要当英雄汉；
        敌人胆敢来侵犯，
      一定将它消灭完！”
    遂平县的卫星人民公社社员对全民皆兵是这样的赞美：
        “提起军事化，人人把它夸，
        全民都是兵，妇女也参加，
        早晨学军事，晚上学文化；
        政治和技术，一起钻研它；
        上地听哨响，欢呼把工下，
        生产如战斗，个个干劲大；
        粮食万斤亩，支援工业化；
        练成文和武，样样拿得下；
        拿锄能生产，提枪把敌杀，
        美帝敢侵犯，送它回老家。”
    人民大学的学生民兵这样的写道：
        “工农商学兵齐武装，
        统帅就是共产党，
        美国豺狼滚出去，
        不然就吃铁巴掌。”
    首都机关民兵师的民兵这样的歌颂民兵师的好处：
        “机关民兵组织好，
        文武全才逞英豪，
        工作军训相结合，
        和平建设更高潮。
        解放台湾意志坚，
        保卫和平信心高，
        美帝胆敢挑战火，
        勒紧绞索决不饶。”
