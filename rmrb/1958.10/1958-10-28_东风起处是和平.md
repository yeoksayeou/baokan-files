    The East Wind Brings Peace
    Liu Qin-xian
    1. The Taedong River flows endlessly, the pines on Moran Hill are evergreen, eight years of friendship bloom like fresh flowers, and the benevolent and righteous army are as close as flesh and blood.
    2. Puncture the American imperialists' paper tiger, the east wind brings peace, red flags wave and white flags fall, sweeping away dark clouds with the west wind.
    3. The madmen in the White House are too forgetful, daring to provoke in the East China Sea, the heroes remount the victory horses, and listen to orders on the Fujian front.
    4. Warn the American imperialists to withdraw their troops quickly, Taiwan also has a "Heartbreak Ridge", now China is even stronger, the noose is tightened and no mercy is shown.

    东风起处是和平
    刘钦贤
    一大同江水流不尽，牡丹峰上松长青，八年友谊鲜花开，仁义之师骨肉亲。
    二戳穿美帝纸老虎，东风起处是和平，红旗招展白旗落，漫卷西风扫乌云。
    三白宫狂人太健忘，敢在东海来挑衅，英雄重跨胜利马，福建前线听命令。四警告美帝快撤军，台湾也有“伤心岭”如今中国更强大，绞索一拉不留情。
