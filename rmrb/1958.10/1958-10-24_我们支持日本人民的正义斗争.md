    We Support the Just Struggle of the Japanese People
    The nine Japanese people from all walks of life, including Kazami Akira, who are visiting China, sent a telegram back to their country on the 21st, condemning Nobusuke Kishi's policy of war and aggression, and demanding that all democratic parties and groups launch a patriotic national movement. The Chinese people warmly support the just patriotic movement of the peace-loving people of Japan. Today, the people of China and Japan have common interests in opposing the aggression of U.S. imperialism and the resurgence of Japanese militarism.
    The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke clique, in order to rely on the United States to rebuild the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, does not hesitate to sell itself to U.S. imperialism, and disregards the interests of the Japanese people and the Japanese nation. After the publication of Nobusuke Kishi's talks with American reporter Brown on the 14th of this month, the hideous face of Japanese militarism has been fully exposed. They are not only prepared to follow the United States and organize the "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" in order to invade China and Asia, but they are also prepared to drag Japan into the abyss of war, causing the Japanese people to suffer endless disasters again. In order to suppress the resistance of the Japanese people, they are also promoting a series of measures such as the enactment of the "Anti-Espionage Law" and the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," making Japan a fascist police state again.
    Recently, the great exposure of the Japanese militarist face and the Kishi Nobusuke clique's further dragging Japan onto the road of war and fascism are by no means accidental. This can be seen as part of a series of military coups instigated by U.S. imperialism in Asia since the victory of the Iraqi people. Its purpose is to suppress the struggle of the Asian people for peace, independence, and democracy, so as to tightly bind these countries to the U.S. war machine as tools for the U.S. to launch wars of aggression and dominate the world.
    The perverse actions of the Kishi Nobusuke clique have made the broad masses of peace-loving people in Japan recognize its latent imperialist essence. The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a commentary on the 17th of this month saying: This time Kishi Nobusuke's remarks prove that the Chinese people's view of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is completely correct. Therefore, with the great exposure of Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary face, the wave of the Japanese people opposing Kishi Nobusuke is also constantly rising. Kotoda Hitomi, a member of the Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on the 16th, strongly condemning Kishi Nobusuke and stating that the Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the Japanese people and carry out a resolute struggle. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, accused the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet of being the second Tojo cabinet on the 18th, and called on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. At the same time, the Japanese Socialist Party passed the "Struggle Declaration to Overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet" at the Central Committee meeting held on the 18th and 19th. The declaration pointed out that throughout Japan, among the masses of all strata, mass movements against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's policy of poverty, reaction, and war are rising, and the struggle for peace and independence and the struggle to defend democracy and life are unfolding.
    According to the current situation, the movement against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is not only rapidly unfolding among the general working people, but has also expanded to the Japanese intellectuals and cultural and artistic circles. Even within the Liberal Democratic Party, many insightful people have expressed dissatisfaction with Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Japan Peace Committee, the Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, and four national women's groups in Japan have all launched struggles against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The Japan Science Council, headed by Mao Makoto, also held a meeting and passed a resolution opposing Kishi Nobusuke's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Aono Suekichi, chairman of the Japan Literary Association, directors Nakajima Kenzō, Hosei University President Ouchi Hyoe, Katayama Tetsu, chairman of the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, and lawyer Unno Shinkichi launched a signature campaign in the Japanese literary and art circles on the 11th to oppose the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment." As of the morning of the 20th, more than 630 Japanese cultural figures, including former University of Tokyo President Nanbara Shigeru, YWCA President Uemura Tamaki, writer Niwa Fumio, and film director Kinoshita Keisuke, had signed. These situations show that Kishi Nobusuke has become a negative teacher for the Japanese people, and he has prompted the Japanese people's awareness to rapidly increase.
    The Chinese people have great sympathy for the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards. Both the Chinese and Japanese people have suffered the pain of war and aggression in the war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists before the war and in the process of U.S. imperialism's aggression against China and occupation of Japan after the war. Opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression and opposing the resurgence of Japanese militarism are the common tasks of the Chinese and Japanese people. However, the struggle of the Japanese people is not without difficulties, and the United States will never relax its control over Japan. As U.S. imperialism becomes increasingly isolated among the people of Asia and the people of the world, and as the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, U.S. imperialism will surely make more frantic struggles to tightly bind Japan to its war machine. It is clear that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" in the future will not make Japan gain more independence, but will make Japan bear more military obligations to the United States. The struggle of the Japanese people is arduous and long-term, which requires all forces in Japan that oppose U.S. imperialism and oppose Kishi Nobusuke's reactionary policies to establish and strengthen unity in the struggle.
    Unity is strength, and only by strengthening unity can we defeat the enemy. The Chinese people express their respect for the Japanese people who have widely stood up to fight, and hope that they will achieve greater achievements in establishing broad joint actions and consolidating solidarity and cooperation. The United States is just a paper tiger. The paper tiger's lackeys must be even more fragile than the paper tiger. We absolutely do not underestimate the strength of the brave and hardworking Japanese people, and at the same time we hope that the Japanese people will never underestimate their own strength. Now is the era of the people. We believe that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and the resurgence of Japanese militarism will surely be victorious.

### 我们支持日本人民的正义斗争

    我们支持日本人民的正义斗争
    正在中国访问的风见章等九位日本各界人士，21日打电报回国，谴责岸信介的战争侵略政策，要求各民主政党和团体展开爱国的国民运动，中国人民热烈支持日本爱好和平人民的正义的爱国运动。今天，中日两国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略和日本军国主义再起这点上，是有着共同的利害关系的。
    日本岸信介集团，为了依靠美国重建大东亚共荣圈，不惜向美帝国主义卖身投靠，把日本人民和日本民族的利益置于不顾。本月14日，岸信介向美国记者布朗发表的谈话公布以后，日本军国主义的狰狞面目已暴露无遗。他们不仅准备追随美国，组织“东北亚条约组织”，以便侵略中国和亚洲，他们还准备把日本拖入战争的深渊，使日本人民重新遭受无穷的灾难。为了镇压日本人民的反抗，他们同时推行制定“防谍法”、修改“警察官职务执行法”等一系列措施，使日本重新成为法西斯警察国家。
    最近以来，日本军国主义面目的大暴露和岸信介集团进一步把日本拖上战争和法西斯的道路，决不是偶然的。这可以看作是，自伊拉克人民取得胜利以来，美帝国主义在亚洲策动的一连串军事政变的一部分。它的目的就是为了镇压亚洲人民争取和平、独立和民主的斗争，以便把这些国家紧紧地缚在美国的战车上，作为美国发动侵略战争和称霸世界的工具。
    岸信介集团的倒行逆施，使日本广大的爱好和平人民认清了它的潜在帝国主义的本质。本月17日的日本“读卖新闻”发表评论说：这次岸信介的谈话证明，中国人民对岸信介内阁的看法是完全正确的。所以随着岸信介的反动面目的大暴露，日本人民反对岸信介的浪潮，也在不断地高涨着。日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员裤田里见在16日发表谈话，强烈地谴责岸信介，并表示日本共产党将站在日本人民的前列进行坚决斗争。日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在18日指责岸信介内阁是第二个东条内阁，号召日本人民起来打倒岸信介内阁。日本社会党同时在18、19两日召开的中央委员会会议上，通过了“打倒岸信介内阁的斗争宣言”。宣言指出，在日本全国各地，在各阶层群众中，反对岸信介内阁执行的这个穷困、反动和战争政策的群众运动，正在高涨起来，争取和平、独立的斗争以及保卫民主和生活的斗争正在展开。
    根据目前的情况来看，反对岸信介内阁的运动，不但在一般劳动人民中迅速地展开，而且已经扩大到日本的知识分子和文化艺术界，甚至在自由民主党内部，也有不少有识之士，对岸信介的反动政策表示不满。日本工会总评议会、日本和平委员会、日本拥护宪法国民联合会和日本四个全国性妇女团体等，都已经和岸信介内阁的反动政策展开了斗争。以茅诚司为首的日本学术会议，也召开会议通过了反对岸信介修改“警察官职务执行法”的决议。日本文艺界协会会长青野季吉、理事中岛健藏、法政大学校长大内兵卫、拥护宪法国民联合会主席片山哲、律师海野晋吉等人11日在日本文艺界发起反对“警察官职务执行法修正案”的签名运动。截至20日晨，已经收到前东京大学校长南原繁、基督教女青年会会长植村环、作家丹羽文雄和电影导演木下惠介等六百三十余名日本文化界人士的签名。这些情况说明岸信介已经成了日本人民的反面教员，他促使日本人民的觉悟迅速地提高。
    中国人民对于日本人民争取和平、独立、民主和改善生活的斗争，寄予极大的同情。中国人民和日本人民都曾在战前日本军国主义分子发动的侵略战争中，和战后美帝国主义侵略中国、侵占日本的过程中，经受过战争和被侵略的痛苦。反对美帝国主义侵略和反对日本军国主义再起，是中日人民的共同任务。不过，日本人民的斗争不是没有困难的，美国对日本的控制是决不会放松的。随着美帝国主义在亚洲人民和世界人民中日益孤立，随着东风压倒西风，美帝国主义一定会作更疯狂的挣扎，紧紧地把日本绑在自己的战车上。很明显，今后日美“安全条约”的修改，不是将使日本获得更多的独立，而是将使日本对美国担负更多的军事义务。日本人民的斗争是艰苦的，同时也是长期的，这就需要日本的反对美帝国主义和反对岸信介反动政策的各方面的力量在斗争中建立和加强团结。
    团结就是力量，只有加强团结才能战胜敌人。中国人民对广泛地站起来斗争的日本人民表示敬意，并希望他们在建立广泛的联合行动和巩固的团结合作中取得更大的成就。美国只是纸老虎。纸老虎的走狗一定比纸老虎更为脆弱。我们绝对不低估勇敢勤劳的日本人民的力量，同时我们希望日本人民也切不要低估自己的力量。现在是人民的时代。我们相信，日本人民反对美帝国主义侵略和日本军国主义再起的斗争是一定能取得胜利的。观察家评论
