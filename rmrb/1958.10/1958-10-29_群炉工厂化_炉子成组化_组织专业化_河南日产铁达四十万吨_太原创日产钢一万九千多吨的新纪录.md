Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th: Henan Province released a huge pig iron satellite on the 25th. On this day, the province's daily output of pig iron reached 400,000,577 tons (including over 129,000 tons of sintered iron). As of this point, the province's accumulated pig iron production in October has reached 900,000,6527 tons, exceeding the state's October pig iron plan by 126.6%; the Xuchang, Xinxiang, and Xinyang special districts have all completed their annual pig iron production plans ahead of schedule.

After the high-yield ten-day period from October 15th to 24th in Henan, steel production increased daily. On the 15th, the iron output was 23,318 tons, and on the 24th, it rose to a daily output of 95,743 tons of pig iron. After the end of the high-yield ten-day period, the province released an even larger satellite on the 25th. The main reason why Henan Province's steel production can shift from a spurt-like satellite release to normal high production is that since early October, after long-term experiments, various localities have affirmed excellent furnace types and established a sufficient number of small-scale indigenous furnaces. As of the statistics on October 21st, a total of 440,000 various excellent iron-smelting furnaces have been built in the province. On the 25th alone, more than 280,000 furnaces were put into production. The advantages of these furnaces are high output, normal production, and good iron quality. In order to ensure continuous high production, various localities have further strengthened the management of steel production since October and gradually implemented mass furnace industrialization and furnace grouping. According to statistics from four special districts and four cities, 42,592 furnace groups (three furnaces as a group) and 2,119 factories have been built. Some areas have also realized production specialization and organized specialized teams for mining, smelting, furnace building, coal mining and coking, and transportation. At present, all parts of the province are continuing to maintain high yields and abundant production based on resources, transportation, and technical conditions, while actively preparing to push steel production to a higher production level in terms of quantity and quality, and to move towards furnace grouping, production organization specialization, mass furnace industrialization, and production base construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: On the last day of the high-yield steel week – the 21st – the people of Taiyuan City realized their ambitious plan to "break through 10,000 tons and catch up with Anshan." On this day, Taiyuan's steel output reached 19,640 tons, exceeding Anshan's steel output on the same day, and only about 600 tons short of the highest daily steel production record created by Anshan Iron and Steel on September 29th.

This is a leap forward in Taiyuan's steel production on the basis of maintaining a high production level. On the first day of the high-yield week – the 15th – the city's steel output broke through the 3,000-ton mark, and then increased day by day, with an average daily output of more than 5,900 tons. By the 21st, the city's "large, foreign, and mass" and "small, indigenous, and mass" steelmaking furnaces were all reaping bumper harvests. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company converted all three open-hearth furnaces into three-taphole steelmaking, and the output increased by nearly one time compared to before. The city also supported the company in building more than 3,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces, which greatly increased the company's output, approaching nine times the average daily output from the 1st to the 14th before the high-yield week. More than 140 factories and mines, such as Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant and Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, have also exceeded their original steel production targets. (Attached picture)

    群炉工厂化　炉子成组化　组织专业化
    河南日产铁达四十万吨
    太原创日产钢一万九千多吨的新纪录
    据新华社郑州28日电　河南省25日放出了巨大的生铁卫星。这一天全省日产生铁四十万零一千五百七十七吨（外产烧结铁十二万九千多吨）。至此，全省10月份累计已生产生铁九十万零六千五百二十七吨，超额126.6％完成了10月份国家生铁计划；许昌、新乡、信阳三个专区，并已提前完成了全年生铁生产计划。
    河南在10月15日到24日的高产旬开始以后，钢铁产量逐日上升。15日产铁二万三千三百一十八吨，24日就上升到日产生铁九万五千七百四十三吨。在高产旬结束以后，全省又在25日放出了更大的卫星。河南省钢铁生产能够由突击性的放卫星转入正常高产，主要原因是各地从10月上旬以来，经过长期的试验，肯定了优秀炉型，并且建立了足够数量的小型土炉。截至10月21日的统计，全省共建成各种优秀的炼铁炉四十四万座。25日当天投入生产的炉子，就有二十八万多座。这些炉子的优点是产量高，生产正常，出的铁质量好。为了保证连续高产，各地从10月份起还进一步加强了对钢铁生产的管理，逐步实行了群炉工厂化、炉子成组化。据四个专区和四个市的统计，已建成四万二千五百九十二个炉组（三炉为一组），二千一百一十九个工厂。有的地区还实现了生产专业化，组织了采矿、冶炼、建炉、挖煤炼焦、运输等专业队伍。现在，全省各地正在根据资源、运输和技术等条件，一面继续保持高额丰产，一面积极准备从数量上质量上把钢铁生产推向一个更高的生产水平，向炉子成组化、生产组织专业化、群炉工厂化和生产基地化迈进。
    据新华社太原电　太原市人民在钢铁高产周的最后一天——21日，实现了“突破万吨猛追鞍山”的豪迈计划。这一天，太原市的钢产量达到了一万九千六百四十吨，超过了鞍山市同一天的钢产量，比鞍钢9月29日创造的日产钢最高纪录只差六百吨左右。
    这是太原市钢的生产在保持高产水平基础上的跃进。高产周的第一天——15日，全市钢产量突破了三千吨大关，以后逐日上升，平均日产量达到五千九百多吨。到21日，全市“大、洋、群”和“小、土、群”炼钢炉同时丰收。太原钢铁公司把三座平炉全部改为三槽出钢，产量比以前提高近一倍。全市还支援这个公司新建了三千多个土炼钢炉，使全公司的产量大大增加，接近高产周以前的1日到14日平均日产量的九倍。太原重型机器厂、太原矿山机器厂等一百四十多个厂矿，也都超过了原定钢产量指标。（附图片）
