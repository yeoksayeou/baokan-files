    A Historical Essay Applying the Past to the Present

    How to implement the principle of valuing the present and belittling the past in history is exemplified well by Comrade Fan Wenlan's article "The Historical Significance of the Reform Movement of 1898," published on page 7 of the People's Daily on September 29th. The article not only provides a brilliant analysis and appropriate conclusion regarding the historical significance of the Reform Movement of 1898, but also strictly follows historical facts to draw historical lessons that meet the needs of socialism. It inspires and makes people think deeply. What inspires is that it elucidates the rationality and inevitability of today's struggle against bourgeois ideology from the laws of historical development, thereby encouraging people to carry out self-transformation. What makes one think deeply is "how merciless and yet affectionate history is, neither forgetting every contribution to history nor tolerating every obstacle to history," and "everything lies in one's own actions, and history is only a fair record," making one, after reading it, have to consider what attitude to take towards reality and how to write one's own history.

    一篇古为今用的史学论文
    在历史学中如何贯彻厚今薄古的原则，9月29日人民日报七版所载范文澜同志的文章“戊戌变法的历史意义”，在这方面做出了很好的榜样。文章不仅对戊戌变法的历史意义作出了精辟的分析和恰如其分的结论，而且严格地遵循着历史实际从中引出了合乎社会主义需要的历史教训。它使人奋发，引人深省。使人奋发的是：它从历史发展的规律中，阐明了今天对资产阶级思想进行斗争的合理性、必然性，从而鼓舞了人们进行自我改造。它引人深省的是“历史多么无情而又有情，不遗忘每一个对历史的贡献，也不宽容每一个对历史的障碍”，“一切在于本身的行动，历史只是公正的纪录”，使人读过之后，不得不考虑自己用什么态度对待现实，怎样写出自己的历史。
