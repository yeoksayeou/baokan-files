    Implementing the Wage System After Liberation Was a Step Forward
    After the national liberation, the situation underwent great changes, and continuing to implement the supply system created many contradictions.
    First, the implementation of the supply system should have meant sharing joys and sorrows together, but the reality was that the salaries of retained personnel were preserved, greatly exceeding the salaries of cadres under the supply system. The wages of workers in capitalist factories were very high, while the wages of workers in state-owned factories were very low. Such large discrepancies led to countless contradictions. Given the level of people's awareness at that time, how could this not affect work morale?
    Second, the supply system contradicted the socialist principle of distribution – to each according to his work. Under the supply system, some cadres, both husband and wife, worked, and if they had children, the state would provide childcare allowances, nanny fees, etc., receiving a large sum of money each month, while those who worked alone lived a low-level supply system life. This was completely contrary to the principle of to each according to his work and could not encourage people to work more and earn more.
    Third, the supply system contradicted the development of production and the prosperity of the economy. A large number of various industrial products were produced, but people were still under the supply system, with very low purchasing power, and the products could not be sold. How could production be developed and the economy prosper? Therefore, the wage system was a step forward compared to the supply system.

    解放后实行工资制是前进了一步
    全国解放后，形势起了很大变化，继续实行供给制就产生了许多矛盾。
    首先是实行供给制应当使大家同甘共苦，而当时情况是，留用人员的工资保留下来，大大超过供给制干部的工资，资本家工厂的工人工资很高，国营工厂工人的工资很低，这样高低悬殊，矛盾百出。在当时人们的觉悟程度还不够高的情况下，怎能不影响工作情绪呢？
    其次，供给制与社会主义的分配原则——按劳取酬发生了矛盾。供给制时，有些干部夫妇两个工作，生了孩子由国家发给小孩扶育费、保姆费等等，每月领一笔巨款，而独身一人工作者则过着很低的供给制生活。这与按劳取酬是完全违背的，不能鼓励人们多劳多得。
    第三，供给制与发展生产、繁荣经济发生了矛盾，生产了大量的、各式各样的工业产品，而人们仍是供给制，购买力很低，产品推销不了，怎能发展生产、繁荣经济呢？因此工资制比供给制，是前进了一步。
