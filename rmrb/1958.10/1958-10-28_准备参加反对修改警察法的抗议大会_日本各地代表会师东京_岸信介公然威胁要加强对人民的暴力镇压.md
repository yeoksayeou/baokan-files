    Xinhua News Agency, October 27th, Tokyo Dispatch: The processions that set out from Hokkaido, Hokuriku, and Kyushu to attend the "Smash the Police Duties Execution Law Amendment, Uphold Life, Rights and Education, and Open Sino-Japanese Relations" National Assembly scheduled for October 28th in Tokyo, arrived in Tokyo today.
    This group of 358 people, composed of representatives selected by prefectural citizens' assemblies, upon arriving in Tokyo, carried resolutions from their prefectural citizens' assemblies to protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government and the organs of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. They also demanded that the speakers of both houses of the Diet take measures to prevent the passage of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" through the Diet. One representative said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" is an attempt to imprison the Japanese people, but the Japanese people today will throw the Kishi Nobusuke government into prison, not allowing it to linger on.
    Before going to protest, representatives from various regions attended a welcome report meeting held by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. The representatives reported on the unanimous and strong opposition of people from all strata of Japanese society to the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and its pursuit of a policy of hostility toward China.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to revive the police state by revising the "Police Duties Execution Law" continues to arouse increasingly strong opposition from all sectors of Japanese society. Besieged by the people of the entire nation, Kishi Nobusuke has openly threatened to carry out suppression. On the 25th, at a meeting of regional assembly members convened by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Kishi Nobusuke stated that he was "determined" to take "foolproof measures" to "prevent" the opposition struggle centered on the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, in order to "maintain public order."
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's National Police Agency has already discussed on the 25th methods for suppressing the joint struggle planned by various Japanese trade unions and other organizations for October 28th and November 5th, and has decided to handle demonstrations and marches that are so-called "unreported" and "obstruct traffic" with a "strict attitude."
    According to the National Police Agency, Japanese fascist organizations protected by the Kishi Nobusuke government are also actively engaged in activities, preparing to take violent actions to support the Kishi Nobusuke government's "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment" and disrupt the Japanese people's opposition struggle. They intend to drive so-called "propaganda vehicles" into the marching ranks and to kidnap union leaders.

    准备参加反对修改警察法的抗议大会
    日本各地代表会师东京
    岸信介公然威胁要加强对人民的暴力镇压
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：为了参加10月28日预定在东京举行的“粉碎警察官职务执行法修正案，维护生活、权利与教育，打开日中关系”国民大会而分别由北海道、北陆、九州三个地方开始游行的队伍，今天到达东京。
    这支由各地县民大会选出的代表组成的三百五十八人的队伍在到达东京以后，就携带县民大会的决议，到岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党的机关进行抗议，并且要求国会两院议长采取措施阻止国会通过“警察官职务执行法修正案”。一位代表说，岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”是想把日本人民关进监狱，但是日本人民今天却要把岸信介政府抛进监狱，不让它再苟延残喘。
    在去抗议以前，各地代表出席了由日本工会总评议会举办的欢迎报告会。代表们纷纷在会上报告日本各地各阶层人民一致强烈反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”和奉行敌视中国的政策的情况。
    据新华社26日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府企图通过修改“警察官职务执行法”以复活警察国家的阴谋，正在继续激起日本各方面人士越来越强烈的反对。处在日本全国人民围攻中的岸信介已经公开威胁要进行镇压。岸信介25日在执政的自由民主党召集的各地区议员会议上表示，他“决心”采取“万无一失的措施”，来“防止”以日本工会总评议会为核心的反对斗争，以“维持公共秩序”。
    岸信介政府的警察厅，25日已经讨论了镇压日本各工会和其它组织预定在10月28日和11月5日举行的联合斗争的办法，并且决定要以“严格的态度”来处理所谓“没有呈报的”和“妨碍交通的”示威游行。
    据警察厅透露，受到岸信介政府保护的日本法西斯组织也在积极进行活动，准备采取暴力行动来支持岸信介政府的“警察官职务执行法修正案”和破坏日本人民的反对斗争。他们打算乘所谓“宣传车”冲进游行队伍，并且要绑架工会的领导干部。
