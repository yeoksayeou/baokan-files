    Alcohol is a Treasure
    Chen Xiying

    Our working people mastered the knowledge and technology of winemaking three to four thousand years ago. They fermented grain to produce firewater, and then fractionated the firewater to increase the alcohol concentration, thus obtaining alcohol.

    Alcohol can be used as a beverage, fuel, and medicine, but with the development of modern industrial and agricultural production, the uses of alcohol have become even more extensive. It is an important basic chemical raw material, from which various things needed for industrial and agricultural production and daily life are produced. It will play a significant role in our socialist construction.

    Alcohol is an alcohol, containing two carbon atoms in its molecule, hence it is called ethanol. Ethanol, through oxidation reactions, can produce acetaldehyde. Further oxidation yields acetic acid (i.e., vinegar); dehydration of ethanol yields ethylene and diethyl ether; passing chlorine gas into ethanol for a longer period of reaction can produce trichloroacetaldehyde; ethanol and hydrogen halide (such as hydrogen bromide) in the presence of a dehydrating agent produce haloalkanes (such as bromoalkanes)... These products are important chemical raw materials. From it, we can obtain ethyl acetate, an important raw material for pig medicine, and some solvents and reagents widely used in organic synthesis. Trichloroacetaldehyde itself is a hypnotic drug, and through it, insecticides such as DDT and Dipterex can be produced. Dipterex is a new insecticide that can not only kill lepidopteran pests but also has special effects on eliminating leeches. Ethylene reacts with dry chlorine gas to produce dichloroethane. Dichloroethane is a good solvent for oils and resins and is also a raw material for the preparation of polysulfide rubber—Thiokol A, and plastic—polyvinyl chloride. If ethylene reacts with chlorine gas in an aqueous solution, another compound—chloroethanol—is produced. Through chloroethanol, many useful products can be obtained, such as polysulfide rubber—Thiokol B and Thiokol D. These synthetic rubbers have valuable properties; gasoline, kerosene, and petroleum have almost no effect on them. If this type of rubber is soaked in gasoline for a year, it will not cause swelling or corrosion. Therefore, using it as an oil pipeline can save a lot of steel. Oxidizing chloroethanol yields chloroacetic acid, which can be further used to produce the plant growth regulators 2,4-D and B-naphthylacetic acid. These things can play a significant role in our agricultural high yields. Through chloroethanol, synthetic fibers—polyacrylonitrile, synthetic rubber—sodium butadiene rubber, and synthetic resins can also be produced.

    The use of alcohol is not limited to this. For example, starting from bromoethane, many organic compounds can be obtained. Further reactions can produce many valuable products. Some people call petroleum the blood of industry. If alcohol is called colorless gold, it still cannot fully illustrate its preciousness.

    The comprehensive utilization of alcohol is one of the important aspects of developing my country's chemical industry and also solves the problem of finding a way out for high-yield potato crops. Not only that, but we must also seek wine from the deep mountains, turning the starch of wild plants all over the mountains and plains into alcohol, so that alcohol can converge into a torrent, rushing to the countryside, rushing to the factories, and contributing tremendous strength to improving our production and improving our lives.

    酒精是宝
    陈希颖
    我国劳动人民在三、四千年前就掌握了酿酒的知识与技术，他们从粮食发酵制得了火酒，将火酒再进行分馏，提高酒的浓度即得酒精。
    酒精可以作饮料、燃料和药用，但是由于近代工农业生产的发展，酒精的用途已更加广泛。它是重要的化工基本原料，从酒精出发，生产出工农业上和日常生活中所需要的各种东西。它在我们的社会主义建设中将发挥很大的作用。
    酒精是一种醇，在它的分子中含有两个碳原子，因此称它做乙醇，乙醇通过氧化反应，可以生成乙醛。进一步氧化得乙酸（即醋酸）；将乙醇进行脱水，可以得到乙烯与乙醚；通氯气在乙醇中，进行较长时间的反应，可制成三氯乙醛；乙醇与卤化氢（如溴化氢）存在有脱水剂时，即生成卤代烷（如溴代烷）……。这一些产物都是重要的化工原料。从它可以得到生产肥猪药的重要原料乙酸乙醋，与一些在有机合成上有广泛用途的溶剂与试剂。三氯乙醛本身是一种催眠药，通过它又可以制成滴滴涕、敌百虫等杀虫剂。敌百虫是一种新的杀虫剂，不仅可以扑灭鳞翅类害虫，对消灭蚂蝗也具有特效。乙烯与干燥的氯气反应即生成二氯乙烷。二氯乙烷是油脂与树脂的良好溶剂，也是制备聚硫橡胶——赛可A，与塑料——聚氯乙烯的原料。若将乙烯与氯气在水溶液中进行反应，又生成另一化合物——氯乙醇，通过氯乙醇又可得到许多有用的产品，如聚硫橡胶——赛可B和赛可D。这些人造橡胶，具有宝贵的性能，汽油、煤油、石油对它几乎没有影响，如将这类橡胶在汽油内浸泡一年，都不会引起膨胀或溶蚀，因此把它用来作输油管，可以节约大量钢材。氧化氯乙醇，可得到氯乙酸，由此可进一步制成植物生长素2、4、D与B——萘乙酸。这些东西对我们的农业丰产可以起很大的作用。通过氯乙醇，还可制成合成纤维——聚丙烯腈，合成橡胶——钠丁橡胶，与合成树脂等。
    酒精的用途还不仅于此，如从溴乙烷出发，可得到好些有机化合物，进一步反应，又可制成许多有价值的产品，有人把石油叫做工业的血液，如果把酒精叫做无色的金子，也还不能充分说明它的可贵。
    酒精的综合利用是发展我国化学工业的重要方面之一，并且也解决了丰产薯类的出路问题。不仅如此，我们还要向深山要酒，将漫山遍野的野生植物的淀粉，变成酒精，让酒精汇成一条洪流，奔向农村，奔向工厂，为提高我们的生产与改善我们的生活贡献出巨大的力量。
