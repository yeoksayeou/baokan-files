    Water Turbines Can Be Manufactured Everywhere
    (Our newspaper reports) The Harbin Electric Machinery Factory successfully manufactured China's first 10,000-kilowatt Francis-type welded water turbine on September 24th.
    The water turbine is a crucial key in water turbine manufacturing. It is a large cast steel component with a very complex shape and high requirements. For example, the water turbine of a 10,000-kilowatt water turbine has a diameter of 2,000 millimeters and a gross weight of 7.5 tons. The tolerance of the cast steel blank is only a few millimeters. Therefore, countries around the world often use the ability to manufacture good water turbine blanks to represent the level of their casting technology. Although some factories in our country have mastered this advanced technology and produced many water turbines to equip several hydropower stations, there are not many factories with such conditions. If the overall casting method is used to manufacture power station equipment, it will not be able to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the electric power industry. This is because it requires not only a high level of casting technology, but also large-scale casting equipment. For example, a 10,000-kilowatt water turbine requires steelmaking equipment with a capacity of 12 tons and corresponding lifting and transportation equipment. To make larger water turbines, even larger equipment is required, which is beyond the capacity of general machine manufacturing plants.
    The method of manufacturing water turbines by welding, which has been successfully tested by the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, is a manufacturing method that reduces the large to the small and simplifies the complex. Because it is cast in blocks and welded into a whole, it can be produced with small equipment. The factory solved the required blanks with only a three-ton electric furnace, which created conditions for the widespread development of water turbine manufacturing. The requirements in terms of manufacturing technology are also greatly reduced, because after the complex water turbine is disassembled into several parts, the shape becomes simpler, which also brings a lot of convenience to subsequent processing. In the past, the blades of water turbines were entirely ground by hand with grinding wheels, but now they can be smoothly processed by machine tools to obtain the required geometric shape and finish.

    水轮机到处可以制造
    本报讯　哈尔滨电机厂在9月24日制成我国第一台一万瓩法西斯式焊接结构的水涡轮。
    水涡轮是水轮机制造中的重大关键，它是一个形状非常复杂要求又高的大型铸钢件，例如一万瓩水轮机的水涡轮的直径二千公厘，毛重七点五吨，铸钢毛坯的公差只允许有几公厘，所以世界各国常常以能否制造出好的水涡轮的毛坯来代表他们的铸造技术水平的高低。我国虽然也有工厂掌握了这种高级技术，生产了不少的水涡轮，装备若干个水电站，但具有这样条件的工厂不多，如沿用整体铸造来制造电站设备，就不能适应高速度发展电力工业的需要。因为它一方面要求有高度的铸造技术，更主要的是要拥有大型的铸造设备。如一万瓩的水涡轮便要有容量十二吨的炼钢设备和相应的起重运输设备，制做更大的水涡轮就要有更大的设备，这对一般机器制造厂来说是无能为力的。
    哈尔滨电机厂试验成功的用焊接方法制造水涡轮是一种化大为小、化繁为简的制造方法。由于是分块铸造并焊成整体，所以有小型的设备就能生产。这个厂只用三吨电炉就解决了所需的毛坯，这样就给水轮机制造的遍地开花创造了条件。在制造技术方面的要求也降低很多，因为复杂的水涡轮拆成若干零块后，形状也就简单，对以后的加工也带来很多方便。过去水涡轮叶片全凭手工操作的砂轮打磨，现在却可以顺利地采用机床加工，获得要求的几何形状和光洁度。（附图片）
