With the Frost's Descent solar term already past, autumn sowing in the Yellow River basin, our country's main wheat-producing area, is approaching its conclusion, and winter planting in the south has also begun extensively. Generally speaking, the quality of autumn sowing this year has greatly improved compared to previous years. The majority of the wheat fields that have already been sown have undergone deep plowing, with each mu receiving over 30,000 jin of base fertilizer, and the amount of seeds sown has significantly increased. However, in some areas, the quality of sowing does not yet match advanced production targets. In Shandong Province, 31% of the deeply plowed land does not meet the provincial Party committee's requirements; sowing quality is poor, with about 11% of the land having less than 20 jin of seeds sown per mu. In Hebei Province, 20% of the more than 30 million mu of wheat fields already sown have not received base fertilizer. Therefore, it is now necessary to conduct a general quality inspection of the already sown wheat fields and quickly take remedial measures for those that do not meet the standards. The Heze and Liaocheng Special Zones in Shandong Province have launched a mass inspection and comparison campaign, achieving "inspection and replenishment of every plot, inspection and replenishment of every row, leaving no inch of soil unaddressed, and striving for every seedling." Fields with very poor sowing quality have been reworked; and fields with insufficient sowing volume, missing seedlings, and broken rows have been replanted or transplanted. For wheat fields currently being sown and about to be sown, while rushing the sowing progress, ensure the sowing quality to lay the foundation for the robust growth of wheat seedlings.

After completing wheat sowing, strengthening field management before winter is a noteworthy task. Most of the effective tillers of wheat are formed before winter, and effective tillers are a critical factor in determining the number of spikes per unit area. The experience of this year's wheat harvest tells us that while strengthening late-stage field management can increase production, achieving higher yields requires not relaxing pre-winter management.

No matter how well the sowing work is done in a field, there will always be variations in seedling emergence, with some emerging well, some moderately, and some poorly. This means that three categories of wheat fields may still exist. It should be recognized that there are indeed some wheat fields where sowing was late, done coarsely, resulting in uneven seedling emergence, missing seedlings, and broken rows. In addition to timely seedling replenishment, field management should be strengthened to eliminate the three categories of seedlings before winter to the greatest extent possible and balance production.

Pre-winter field management for wheat mainly involves topdressing fertilizer and irrigation. For wheat fields with insufficient or no fertilizer, as well as those sown later with smaller seed quantities, multiple topdressings should be applied as early as possible before winter to compensate for the lack of base fertilizer, promote tillering, ensure the robustness of plants and sufficient plant density. At the same time, timely irrigation should be carried out to retain soil moisture, and underground pests should be controlled immediately to ensure that no row in the wheat field is missing and no seedling is lost, ensuring safe overwintering.

For large-area high-yield fields and extremely high-yield fields, it is even more necessary to follow the plan, link by link, without relaxing any processing环节 (lit. processing links). Only in this way can we build next year's wheat harvest on a solid foundation.

    赶快查苗补苗
    霜降已至，黄河流域我国主要麦产区秋播工作已到基本结束的阶段，南方冬种也已广泛展开。一般说，今年各地秋播质量都较往年有很大提高。已经播种的麦地绝大部分经过深翻，每亩施基肥在三万斤以上，播种的种籽量显著增加。但是有些地区播种质量与先进的生产指标还不相适应。山东省不合省委要求的深翻地占已翻面积的31％；播种质量较差，有每亩播种的种数不到二十斤的约11％。河北省已播的三千多万亩麦田中有20％没有施基肥。因此现在有必要对于已播的麦田普遍进行一次质量检查，对于不合规格的麦田赶快进行补救。山东省菏泽、聊城专区开展了群众性的检查评比运动，作到了“块块查补、垅垅查补，寸土不让、棵苗必争”，播种质量很差的，重新返工；播种量不足，缺苗断垅的，也进行了补种移苗。对于正在播种和即将播种的麦田，也在突击播种进度的同时，保证播种质量，打下麦苗茁壮生长的基础。
    在完成小麦播种之后，加强冬前田间管理工作是一件很值得注意的工作。小麦的有效分蘖多半在冬前形成，而有效分蘖是决定单位面积穗数的重要因素。今年小麦丰收的经验告诉我们，加强后期田间管理固然可以增产，但是要获得更高的丰产，决不能放松冬前的管理。
    不论播种工作做得多么好的田，出苗情况总还是有上、中、下之分，这就是说，三类麦田也还是可能存在的。应该看到现在确实还有一些麦田播种迟，播的粗，出苗不齐，缺苗断垅，除了及时补苗外，还应加强田间管理，尽最大努力把三类苗消灭在冬前，平衡生产。
    冬前麦田的田间管理工作主要是追肥、灌水。对于施肥不足或是没施肥的麦田，以及播种较迟，播种量少的麦田，必须在冬前尽早地进行多次追肥，以弥补基肥的不足，促进分蘖，保证植株的健壮和足够的株数，同时还要适时灌水保墒，发现地下虫害立即防治，保证麦田一垅不缺一苗不少，安全越冬。
    对于大面积丰产田及高额丰产田更需按照计划，一环套一环，不放松任何一个加工环节。只有这样，才能把明年小麦丰收建立在可靠的基础上。
