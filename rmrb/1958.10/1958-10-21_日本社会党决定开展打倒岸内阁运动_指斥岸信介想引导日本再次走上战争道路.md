Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tokyo News: The Central Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party held a meeting on the 18th and 19th, deciding to launch a movement to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and passing the "Declaration of Struggle to Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet."

The declaration stated that Nobusuke Kishi was once a person in charge during the Pacific War. Before the wounds of war have healed, Nobusuke Kishi is attempting to revise the constitution, announcing the deletion of clauses renouncing war, planning to send troops abroad, implement nuclear armament, and lead Japan onto the path of war again.

The declaration condemned the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet for expressing an attitude of openly antagonizing the People's Republic of China during the emergency situation in the Taiwan Strait. The declaration exposed Nobusuke Kishi's plot to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in order to form a Japan-U.S. military alliance and to establish a military system of a Northeast Asia treaty organization with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee cliques.

The declaration pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet has consistently made education reactionary, restricted the rights of the working people, and is now attempting to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law," plotting to make Japan a police state again.

The declaration said that the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet exclusively serves the monopoly capitalist groups, and is plunging Japan's economy into the abyss of depression, making the working people increasingly impoverished.

The declaration emphasized that throughout Japan, among all levels of the masses, the mass movement against the impoverishment, reaction, and war policies implemented by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet is rapidly rising, and the struggle for peace and independence, as well as the struggle to defend democracy and life, is being resolutely launched. These individual movements are converging into a torrent. The declaration stated that the Socialist Party is determined to unite the power of the entire party to fight for the overthrow of the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet.

The meeting also decided to launch a national movement to oppose the government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." During the meeting's discussion of the plan proposed by the Socialist Party's executive body on this issue, speakers pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" is to restore the pre-war "Public Peace Police Law" and "Administrative Execution Law," and to turn Japan into a police state again.

Some speakers demanded that all democratic parties and groups unite to fight together against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law."

Although the executive body explained the issue, twenty-two central committee members still proposed amendments to the original plan, including a request to "issue an appeal to all groups" and advocated strengthening the struggle inside and outside the Diet to oppose the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law." Finally, Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma stated that he would add the sentence "an appeal should be issued to all groups cooperating with the party" to the original plan and write the opinions of the amendments into the future struggle guidelines. The meeting then passed the plan proposed by the executive body.

    日本社会党决定开展打倒岸内阁运动
    指斥岸信介想引导日本再次走上战争道路
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：东京消息：日本社会党中央委员会在18日和19日举行了会议，决定开展打倒岸信介内阁的运动，通过了“打倒岸信介内阁的斗争宣言”。
    宣言说，岸信介曾经是太平洋战争的负责人，在战争的创伤还没有痊愈的今天，岸信介又想修改宪法，宣布要删除放弃战争的条款，打算派兵出国，实行核武装，引导日本再次走上战争的道路。
    宣言谴责岸信介内阁在台湾海峡形势紧急的时候，表示了公然敌视中华人民共和国的态度。宣言揭露了岸信介企图修改日美“安全条约”，以便结成日美军事同盟，并且同蒋介石和李承晚集团建立东北亚条约组织的军事体系的阴谋。
    宣言指出，岸信介内阁过去一直使教育反动化，限制劳动人民的权利，现在又在企图修改“警察官职务执行法”，阴谋使日本重新成为一个警察国家。
    宣言说，岸信介内阁专门为垄断资本集团服务，正在使日本的经济陷于萧条的深渊，使劳动人民日益贫困。
    宣言强调指出，在日本全国各地，在各阶层群众中，反对岸信介内阁执行的这个穷困、反动和战争政策的群众运动正在迅速高涨起来，争取和平、独立的斗争以及保卫民主和生活的斗争正在坚决地展开。这些一个一个的运动正在汇合成为一股洪流。宣言表示社会党下了很大的决心，要团结全党的力量，为打倒岸信介内阁而奋斗。
    会议还决定开展国民运动来反对政府修改“警察官职务执行法”。在会议讨论社会党执行机构对于这个问题所提出的方案时，发言者纷纷指出，岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”就是要恢复战前的“治安警察法”和“行政执行法”，就是要使日本重新变成警察国家。
    有的发言者要求各民主党派、团体团结起来，共同为反对修改“警察官职务执行法”而斗争。
    虽然执行机构对这个问题进行了解释，还是有二十二个中央委员对原方案提出了修正案，其中要求“向一切团体发出呼吁”，并主张加强国会内外的斗争，来反对修改“警察官职务执行法”。最后社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎表示将在原方案中加上“要向一切同党合作的团体发出呼吁”一句话并且把修正案的意见写进今后的斗争方针中。会议于是通过了执行机构提出的方案。
