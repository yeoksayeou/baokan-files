Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Today, Bo Yibo, Director of the National Economic Commission, delivered a radio address titled "Push the High Tide of the Whole Party and People Running the Steel Industry to a New Peak" on the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

Bo Yibo said that since the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in August put forward the great call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year and double steel production, it has been enthusiastically supported by the people of the whole country, especially the workers on the steel front. In less than a month and a half, a massive high tide of the whole party and people running the steel industry has been set off across the country.

Bo Yibo said that the victory on the steel front in September was not only reflected in the increase in quantity. Through this large-scale training phase, China's industrial front, with the steel industry as its backbone, has been pushed to a new peak.

He said that the current situation is very good. First, politics has taken command. The first secretaries of Party committees at all levels have personally taken command and are supervising and guiding the steel front day and night. Local Party committees have made leading steel production the most important political task at present. Second, a vigorous mass movement has emerged. The slogan "Mobilize the whole people to ensure the doubling of steel production" has taken root in the hearts of the people. The situation in which workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, men, women, old and young, are all smelting steel has emerged. The ranks of the steel front have expanded unprecedentedly, from hundreds of thousands or millions in the past to more than 50 million, plus those directly and indirectly supporting from other fronts, about 100 million people up and down.

Third, the road to developing steel production at high speed has been initially grasped by the masses, which is the road proposed by the Party Central Committee of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, with "small indigenous groups" as the main focus at present.

Fourth, on the basis of implementing the policy of taking steel as the key link, a new atmosphere of unprecedentedly close cooperation among provinces, regions, and departments has emerged. Railway, transportation, coal, geology, chemical, building materials, finance and trade departments are all actively taking revolutionary measures to adapt to the needs of high-speed steel development, both promoting the great leap forward in their own industries and promoting the great leap forward in the steel industry. The Ministry of Railways has already launched a big satellite of loading more than 52,000 trucks a day on the 28th; the Ministry of Coal has also launched a big satellite of producing one million tons a day on the 29th; the Ministry of Foreign Trade has also done a lot of work to support the great leap forward in steel; the Ministry of Commerce has vigorously purchased scrap steel and iron; the Ministry of Education has transferred more than 30,000 teachers and students in metallurgy, geology, and chemical engineering to help various localities solve technical problems; and scientific research institutions have also participated in the battle to support steel production. Even the entire officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are supporting steel production with the greatest enthusiasm, contributing both manpower and resources. The nationwide cooperation movement has brought about an all-round great leap forward in various departments of the national economy.

Bo Yibo then said that October is the key month to complete the annual steel plan. The monthly output of steel and iron must double compared to September. The task before us is arduous and glorious. Therefore, we must not only maintain and consolidate the production level of the high-yield satellites that have already been launched, but also strive to create a larger area of high yield, and combine the launching of satellites with the creation of a large area of high yield. In October, we require an average daily production of more than 60,000 tons of steel and more than 100,000 tons of iron, and we also require the emergence of more than ten "10,000-ton provinces" and more than fifty "1,000-ton counties."

To achieve these targets, Party committees at all levels must continue to make persistent efforts on the basis of the satellites already launched at the end of September; strengthen specific leadership over steel production; continue to implement the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and the whole party and people running the steel industry; further mobilize the masses in depth; promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to be independent; and launch the "Huaihai Campaign" on the steel front. At the same time, we must break through the following three barriers:

First, break through the technical barrier. First of all, we must pay attention to grasping the technical barrier of indigenous blast furnaces. Leading cadres in various localities must firmly grasp the production technology of indigenous blast furnaces, conduct more test furnaces, summarize and promote the experience of long-life furnaces and high-yield furnaces that the masses have already created; at the same time, we must also pay attention to cold and frost prevention, and try our best to turn cold air into hot air to ensure that indigenous blast furnaces continue to maintain high yields in winter. In October, we require that more than 60% of the indigenous blast furnaces that have been built can be put into production; among the furnaces that are put into production, we also require that more than 60% be in normal production, creating conditions for a large area of high yield of pig iron. Secondly, we must grasp the technical barrier of steelmaking using indigenous iron and indigenous methods. The masses in Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces have already created good experiences in using various types of indigenous steelmaking furnaces to make steel. It is hoped that all localities will seriously learn from them and create more and better experiences in indigenous steelmaking according to local conditions. Again, we must also overcome the technical barrier of using indigenous iron in foreign furnaces to make steel. Many foreign steelmaking furnaces across the country used to only "eat" foreign iron and could not "eat" indigenous iron. Therefore, we must immediately organize forces and set a time limit to break through the technical barrier of using indigenous iron in foreign furnaces to make steel, and strive to use indigenous iron of relatively poor quality to make good steel. Finally, the workers of large and medium-sized steel enterprises across the country must continue to innovate technologies, learn advanced experiences, improve the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, and electric furnaces, and strive to reach the advanced level of the national "Red Flag Furnaces" and "Satellite Furnaces," with blast furnace utilization coefficients reaching the record of Benxi Steel Plant, open-hearth furnace utilization coefficients reaching the record of Shanghai Steel Plant, and refractory material production reaching the record of Chongqing Plant.

Second, we must break through the raw materials barrier. We should ensure that hundreds of thousands of indigenous and foreign furnaces across the country have a constant supply of raw materials, so as to continuously achieve large-scale high yields. Therefore, we must always reserve enough "grain and grass," including ore, coking coal, refractory materials, ferrosilicon, ferromanganese, acids, alkalis, etc. Especially now that the weather is gradually turning cold, and mining in high mountains and wildernesses is more difficult in winter, we should seize the opportunity in October to rush to prepare materials. It is hoped that all localities will quickly mobilize forces, organize mining teams, and rush to mine, preparing several months or half a year of ore, coking coal, and other raw materials to ensure that there is no phenomenon of stopping production waiting for materials.

Third, we must break through the transportation barrier. In October, steel production will double compared to September, and at the same time, we must reserve ore and coking coal for the next few months, which will bring more arduous tasks to the transportation industry. Therefore, the secretaries must take command and mobilize all available manpower and transportation tools to participate in steel transportation, and gradually establish a standing transportation army. On the one hand, raw materials such as ore and coking coal should be transported to the vicinity of large and small blast furnaces in a timely manner; on the other hand, the iron produced by indigenous blast furnaces scattered in various places should be quickly gathered and transported to the vicinity of steelmaking furnaces, ensuring "no difference in weight and no delay in time" to meet the needs of steel production.

Bo Yibo finally said that October is a month of great leap forward and also a key month. Successfully completing and overfulfilling the steel production task in October will lay a reliable foundation for completing 10.7 million tons of steel throughout the year. Let us continue to work hard, fight hard for a month, launch more and bigger "high-yield satellites" of steel, create a larger area of high yield, and push the high tide of the whole party and people running the steel industry to a new peak!

    国家经委主任薄一波发表广播讲话
    把钢铁生产高潮推向新高峰
    十月份要突破三关取得“淮海大战”彻底胜利
    新华社30日讯　今天国家经济委员会主任薄一波在中央人民广播电台以“把全党全民办钢铁工业的高潮推向新的高峰”为题发表广播讲话。
    薄一波说，从8月中共中央政治局扩大会议提出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢、实现钢铁产量翻一番的伟大号召以后，得到了全国人民首先是钢铁战线上职工们的热烈拥护，不到一个半月的时间，就在全国范围内掀起了一个声势浩大的全党全民大办钢铁工业的高潮。
    薄一波说，9月份钢铁战线上的胜利还不仅表现在数量的增长上，通过这个大练兵阶段，把我国以钢铁工业为骨干的工业战线推向了新的高峰。
    他说，当前的形势很好，第一是政治挂了帅。各级党委的第一书记已经亲自挂帅，夜以继日地在钢铁前线上督战指导。各地党委已经把领导钢铁生产列为当前头等重要的政治任务。第二，出现了气势磅礴的群众运动。“全民动员、保证钢铁翻一番”的口号，已经深入人心。工农商学兵、男女老幼一齐炼钢的局面已经出现。钢铁前线的队伍空前扩大，已经从过去的几十万人、几百万人增加到五千多万人，加上其他战线上直接间接支援的人，大约有一亿人上下。
    第三，高速度发展钢铁生产的道路已初步地为广大群众所掌握，这就是党中央所提出大、中、小同时并举而目前以“小土群”为主的道路。
    第四，在贯彻执行以钢为纲的方针基础上，出现了各省、各地区、各部门之间空前密切大协作的新气象。铁道、交通、煤炭、地质、化工、建材和财经贸易各部门，都在积极地采取革命措施，适应钢铁高速度发展的需要，既搞本行业的大跃进，又促进钢铁工业的大跃进。铁道部已经在28日发出了一天装车五万二千多辆的大卫星；煤炭部也在29日放出了日产一百万吨的大卫星；外贸部为了支援钢铁大跃进，也做了很多工作；商业部大力收购废钢废铁；教育部抽调了三万多名冶金、地质、化工方面的教员和学生帮助各地解决技术问题；科学研究机关也参加了支援钢铁生产的战斗。甚至中国人民解放军的全体官兵也以最大的热情，出人出力，支援钢铁生产。全国范围的大协作运动带来了国民经济各部门的全面大跃进。
    薄一波接着说，10月份是完成全年钢铁计划的关键月，钢和铁的月产量都要比9月份翻一番，摆在我们面前的任务是艰巨和光荣的。因此，我们不但要保持和巩固已经发射的高产卫星的生产水平，而且还要力争创造更大面积的丰产，把发射卫星和创造大面积丰产结合起来。10月份我们要求每天平均能够生产六万吨以上的钢、十万吨以上的铁，并且要求出现十个以上的“万吨省”和五十个以上的“千吨县”。
    要实现这些指标，各级党委必须在9月底已经发出的卫星的基础上再接再厉；加强对钢铁生产的具体领导、继续贯彻执行大中小并举、土洋并举、和全党全民办钢铁的方针，进一步深入发动群众，发扬敢想敢说敢做敢独创的共产主义风格，展开钢铁战线上的“淮海大战”。同时，必须突破以下三个关：
    第一，突破技术关。首先，要注意抓土高炉的技术关。各地领导干部必须狠狠地抓土高炉的生产技术，多搞试验炉、总结推广群众已经创造的长寿炉、高产炉的经验；同时还要注意防寒、防冻工作，尽可能地把冷风变成热风，保证土高炉在冬天继续保持高产。在10月份，我们要求已经建成的土高炉能够有60％以上投入生产；投入生产的炉子中间，又要求有60％以上正常生产，为生铁大面积丰收创造条件。其次，要抓土铁土法炼钢的技术关。山西、河南等省的群众已经创造了利用各种各样的土法炼钢炉炼钢的好经验，希望各地认真学习，并且因地制宜地创造更多更好的土法炼钢的经验。再次，还要过好洋炉使用土铁炼钢的技术关。全国许多洋炼钢炉过去只会吃洋铁，不会吃土铁。因此，必须立刻组织力量，限期突破洋炉使用土铁炼钢的技术关，力争用质量比较次的土铁，炼出好钢来。最后，全国大中钢铁企业的职工们，更要不断革新技术，学习先进经验，提高平炉、高炉、电炉设备的利用系数，向全国最先进的“红旗炉”、“卫星炉”看齐，高炉利用系数达到本溪钢厂的纪录，平炉利用系数达到上海钢厂的纪录，耐火材料生产达到重庆厂的纪录。
    第二，要突破原材料关。应该保证全国几十万个土炉子和洋炉子有源源不断的原材料供应，以便接连不断地取得大面积丰产。因此，必须经常储备足够的“粮草”，包括矿石、焦煤、耐火材料、矽铁、锰铁、酸碱等等。特别是目前天气逐渐转冷，高山旷野在冬天采矿比较困难，更应该在10月份抓紧时机突击备料。希望各地迅速调集力量，组织采矿队，突击采矿，准备好几个月或者半年的矿石、焦煤，和其他原材料，保证不发生停产待料的现象。
    第三，要突破运输关。10月份钢铁产量比9月份要翻一番，同时还要为以后几个月储备矿石、焦煤，这就给交通运输事业带来了更加繁重的任务。因此必须书记挂帅，把一切能动员的人力和运输工具都动员起来，参加钢铁运输，逐步建立常备的运输大军。一方面，及时把矿石、焦煤等原材料运到大大小小的高炉旁边；另一方面，又要把分散在各地的土高炉生产的铁，迅速集中起来，运到炼钢炉旁边。保证“斤两不差、分秒不误”，满足钢铁生产的需要。
    薄一波最后说，10月份是跃进月，也是关键月，胜利完成和超额完成10月份的钢铁生产任务，就可以为全年完成一千零七十万吨钢打下可靠的基础。让我们继续鼓足干劲，苦战一月，放出更多更大的钢铁“高产卫星”，创造更大面积的丰产，把全党全民大办钢铁工业的高潮推向新的高峰！
