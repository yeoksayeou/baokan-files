Since the policy of combining education with productive labor has been universally implemented throughout the country, schools running factories, schools running farms, schools running pastures, schools running schools, schools running geological survey teams, schools linking up with various production units... a hundred flowers are blooming, and fruits are abundant. Once theory is combined with practice, people's understanding will inevitably take a leap. The practice of the past six months has led to a new situation of great teaching reform, great ideological revolution in academic thought, great development in scientific research, and great leap forward in ideological awareness. Now, people are following this path, striding towards eliminating the differences between mental and physical labor, and actively preparing conditions for communism. The exhibits in the twenty-seven local pavilions of the National Exhibition on the Combination of Education and Productive Labor, which is being prepared for two months and will soon be opened, prove this truth. This newspaper will successively introduce the content of this exhibition to readers. —Editor

Taking the Path of Both Literary and Military Skills to Become a Pioneer in Science and Technology

Beijing: Scientific Research Leaps Forward
Henan: Agricultural Technology Shines
Hebei: Scientific Research Enters a Feverish Period

The Beijing Pavilion is a large-scale "Industrial and Agricultural Expo" and a labor university.

The exhibition shows that various factories established by universities and secondary vocational schools in Beijing in the past year in combination with their majors are playing an increasingly important role in promoting teaching reform and scientific research. According to statistics as of September, universities in Beijing have established more than 500 factories and workshops on campus. On the basis of participating in productive labor, teachers and students have created hundreds of cutting-edge scientific research achievements. Among the eight new types of steel researched and manufactured by teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology on display at the conference, four products, including ultra-high-strength construction steel, have exceeded the performance of the American "ace" high-strength construction steel and similar products from Sweden, West Germany, and other countries. The exhibits also include silicon strips refined by Tsinghua University, with a purity reaching the international advanced level. The C168 screw lathe created entirely by the teachers and students of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of this school using ductile iron can save a lot of steel for the country and is a major technological innovation in the mechanical industry's "replacing steel with iron and replacing forging with casting." The artificial cloud dissipation method successfully tested by the Meteorology Department of Peking University has made seeing the sun through the clouds a preliminary reality. The million-fold projection electron microscope manufactured by the teachers and students of the Physics Department of this school can see atoms. The charts on display also show that universities in Beijing are continuing to run factories on a large scale on campus, in order to better organize production, make production more closely integrated with teaching and scientific research, and make schools leap towards the goal of a joint base for labor production, teaching, and scientific research.

The exhibition also showcased the gains of teachers and students of Beijing universities working outside the school. In the past six months, more than 20,000 teachers and students from Beijing universities have gone to all parts of the country to eat, live, and work with workers and farmers, and conduct teaching and scientific research in conjunction with labor. Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Geology have completed survey tasks covering an area of more than 1.3 million square kilometers in 420 counties in 19 provinces and cities in more than two months, and assisted local areas in finding iron ore that can be used for 120 years if calculated based on an annual output of 100 million tons of steel.

The Henan Pavilion prominently introduces the high tide of the massive and magnificent cultural revolution.

More than 26,000 various kinds of red and expert universities have been established in rural areas, factories, mines, organs, and urban streets in Henan Province, with more than 8.3 million people participating in learning. Here, people can see the Shangqiu County Daokou Township Red and Expert University inspected by the beloved Chairman Mao in August this year, how farmers at the foot of Songshan Mountain learn philosophy, the Red Flag Iron and Steel College beside the blast furnace group in Xinyang City, which is releasing steel satellites, the Red and Expert University for cadres directly under Mengjin County, and the Red and Expert University for residents of Qiyelu Street in Shangqiu City, etc. The exhibition hall displays the results of labor and study of the students of the Red and Expert University, including the steel produced, ball bearings, chemical fertilizers, improved agricultural tools, agricultural production satellite objects and pictures. A deep-plowing plow created by the students of Chaoxin Red and Expert University in Tangyin County can deeply cultivate from one foot five inches to two feet. The Daokou Township Red and Expert University in Shangqiu County created a sweet potato slicing machine that can slice 500,000 catties per day. The Xuangou Red and Expert University in Tangyin County created a sweet potato roasting machine that can roast millions of catties day and night. The Wu'ai Commune Red and Expert University in Kaifeng County created a winnowing machine that can winnow about 3,000 catties of grain per person per hour... The students are really amazing in planting experimental fields. As soon as you enter the exhibition hall, you can see tobacco plants more than fifteen feet tall with more than 120 tobacco leaves, soybeans fifteen feet tall, one winter melon bearing eight, the largest weighing 120 catties, one zucchini bearing thirty-eight, the largest weighing 46 catties. The experimental field of the Wuqiao Youth Agricultural College in Shangqiu County produced 27,733 catties of millet per mu, and the students of the Daokou Township Red and Expert University invented and created more than 17,000 pieces in a short period of time.

In the exhibition hall, you can also see that teachers and students from elementary schools to middle schools and universities throughout the province are also advancing towards the intellectualization of laborers, closely combining teaching with productive labor. According to incomplete statistics from 900 schools, 8,903 factories and 841 farms have been established. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine School has established six industrial systems. Among them, the Jiaodong Inclined Shaft Project, which uses the latest technology of hydraulic coal mining, is completely contracted by teachers and students from design and construction to production management, creating the highest daily progress record for local well construction in the province. The No. 1 Middle School of Xiayi County released a satellite of 22,000 catties of corn per mu in its own experimental field. According to incomplete statistics from 1,220 schools, the output value of industry and agriculture this year reached 171.135 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics from 2,363 secondary schools in the province, more than 96,000 inventions and creations have been made in the past few months.

The Hebei Pavilion exhibits thousands of products such as steel, machinery, cement, fertilizers, pesticides, coke, transformers, radios, knitwear, and dyes, all of which are produced by students. After three months of hard work, all teachers and students of Tianjin University built 120 factories of various types, forming an independent industrial system, including an iron and steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 15,000 tons of steel and 5,000 tons of rolled steel. Fengfeng No. 2 Middle School produces 15.7 tons of steel per day. Tianjin No. 57 Middle School produces 2,000 radios, 10,000 soldering irons, and 20,000 ballasts per month... with a monthly output value of more than 1.9 million yuan.

Under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students of various universities have carried out mass scientific research activities and achieved great results. Nankai University completed 1,761 scientific research projects in just 45 days, of which 575 have caught up with or exceeded international standards. The ion exchanger made by the school is a young cutting-edge science in the world. It can turn seawater into fresh water, extract gold from seawater, refine rare elements, and purify factory wastewater... It also has great uses in medicine and national defense. Among the 213 types of ion exchangers that have been measured, 120 exceed those of the United Kingdom and the United States. Among the cutting-edge scientific products, the atomic reactor, β (beta) spectrometer, and organophosphorus insecticide of Nankai University are introduced, and the magnetic tape recording reverse program control lathe and cyclotron of Tianjin University are exhibited; there are also remote control telemetry equipment made by Tangshan Railway College, and a model of a 600-horsepower electric transmission diesel locomotive. Many products in primary and secondary schools have also reached or exceeded international levels.

Due to the combination of education and productive labor, a mass teaching reform has also been launched in schools. Tianjin Normal University alone revised 96 teaching syllabuses and compiled 69 kinds of teaching materials. The pavilion exhibited teaching syllabuses, textbooks, and other physical objects from Tianjin Normal University, Nankai University, and other schools.

Students also showed great talent in agricultural production. On display were sorghum with a yield of 30,012 catties per mu, corn with a yield of 10,805 catties per mu, cotton with a yield of 2,500 catties of lint cotton per mu, and tomatoes with a yield of 50,000 catties per mu, as well as "satellites" such as vegetables and fruits.

专栏：

    自从教育结合生产劳动的方针在全国普遍推行以来，学校办工厂、学校办农场、学校办牧场、学校办学校、学校办地质普查队、学校和各种生产单位挂钩……百花齐放，果实累累。理论一经结合实践，人的认识就必然会有一个飞跃。半年以来的实践，就使教学大改革、学术思想大革命、科学研究大发展、思想意识大跃进的新局面出现了。现在，人们正循着这个道路向着消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别大步迈进，为共产主义积极准备条件。筹备两月，即将展出的全国教育和生产劳动相结合展览会的二十七个地方馆的展品证明了这一真理。本报将向读者陆续介绍这个展览会的内容。　——编者
    走能文能武途径做科学技术尖兵
    北京：科学研究飞跃前进
    河南：农业技术大放异彩
    河北：科学研究进入热潮
    北京馆是一个规模庞大的“工农业博览会”和一所劳动大学。
    展览会表明：北京各高等学校和中等专业学校一年来结合专业在校内兴办的各种工厂，正在对教学改革和科学研究发挥着越来越大的促进作用。据截至9月份的统计，北京各高等学校共办起校内工厂车间五百多个。在参加生产劳动的基础上师生们创造了数百种尖端科学研究成果。会上展出的北京钢铁工业学院师生研究制造的八种新钢材中，有超高强度建筑钢等四种产品，在性能上已经分别超过了美国的“王牌”高强度建筑钢和瑞典、西德等国的同类产品。展品中还有清华大学提炼的硅条，纯度达到国际先进水平。这个学校的机械制造系师生完全用球墨铸铁创制的C168型螺丝车床，可以给国家节省大量钢材，是在机械工业的“以铁代钢，以铸代锻”方面的一项重大技术革新。北京大学气象专业试验成功的人工消云法使拨云见日初步成为现实，这个学校物理系师生制造的一百万倍投射式电子显微镜可以看见原子。展出的图表还表明，北京各高等学校正继续在校内大办工厂，以便能更好地组织生产，使生产同教学、科学研究更紧密地结合起来，使学校向劳动生产、教学、科学研究的联合基地的目标跃进。
    会上还展出了北京各高等学校师生校外劳动的收获。半年多以来，北京高等学校已经有两万多师生到全国各地和工人农民同吃同住同劳动，并结合劳动进行教学和科学研究。北京地质学院师生两个多月以来在十九个省、市，四百二十多个县完成了面积达一百三十多万平方公里的勘测任务，协助地方找到的铁矿如以年产一亿吨钢计算，可用一百二十年。
    河南馆突出地介绍了声势浩大、规模壮阔的文化革命高潮。
    河南省农村、厂矿、机关和城市街道办起各种各样的红专大学二万六千多所，有八百三十多万人参加学习。在这里，人们可以看到敬爱的毛主席今年8月视察的商丘县道口乡红专大学，在嵩山脚下的农民怎样学哲学，在大放钢铁卫星的信阳市高炉群边的红旗钢铁学院，孟津县直属机关干部的红专大学，以及商丘市企业路街道居民的红专大学等。陈列室展出了红专大学学员们劳动和学习的成果，有炼出来的钢铁、滚珠轴承、化学肥料、改良农具，农业生产的卫星实物和图片，汤阴县朝欣红专大学的学员们创造的一种深翻犁，可以深耕一尺五寸到二尺；商丘县道口乡红专大学创制了每天可切五十万斤的红薯切片机，汤阴县宣沟红专大学创制的昼夜可炕百万斤的红薯炕片机，开封县五爱社红专大学创制的每人每小时可扬粮食三千斤左右的扬场机……。学员们种试验田真了不起，一进陈列室，人们就可以看到一丈五尺多高有一百二十多个烟叶的烟株，一丈五尺高的大豆，一棵冬瓜结了八个，最大的达一百二十斤，一棵笋瓜结了三十八个，大的有四十六斤，商丘县五桥青年农学院的试验田亩产谷子二万七千七百三十三斤，道口乡红专大学的学员短短的时间就发明创造一万七千多件。
    在展览馆，还可以看到，全省从小学到中学、大学，师生们也在向知识分子劳动化前进，把教学与生产劳动紧密结合起来。据九百所学校不完全的统计，即已办起工厂八千九百零三个，农场八百四十一个。焦作煤矿学校已经建立起六种工业体系，其中采用水力采煤最新技术的焦东斜井工程，从设计、施工到生产管理完全由师生一包到底，创造了全省土法建井日进度的最高纪录；夏邑县第一中学在自己的试验田里，放出了亩产玉米二万二千斤的卫星。据一千二百二十所学校的不完全统计，今年工农业产值达一亿七千一百三十五万元。据全省二千三百六十三所中等学校的不完全统计，几个月来的创造发明达九万六千多件。
    河北馆展出了钢铁、机械、水泥、化肥、农药、焦炭、变压器、收音机、针织品、染料等数千件产品，这些都是学生生产出来的。天津大学全体师生经过三个月的苦战，建起了各种工厂一百二十个，自成工业体系，其中钢铁联合企业年产钢铁可达一万五千吨、轧钢五千吨。峰峰二中日产钢铁十五点七吨。天津五十七中每月生产收音机二千台，电烙铁一万把，镇流器二万个，……月产值一百九十多万元。
    各高等学校师生在党的领导下，开展了群众性的科学研究活动，取得了巨大成就。南开大学仅在四十五天中就完成了一千七百六十一个科学研究项目，其中五百七十五项已赶上或超过国际水平。该校制成的离子交换剂，是年轻的世界尖端科学，它能使海水变为淡水，由海水中提取黄金，提炼稀有元素，净化工厂废水……在医学和国防上也有很大用处。在已测定的二百一十三种离子交换剂中，有一百二十种超过英美。在尖端科学成品中，介绍了南开大学的原子反应堆、β
  （贝他）谱仪和有机磷杀虫剂，展出了天津大学的磁带录反式程序控制车床和回旋加速器；还有唐山铁道学院制成的遥控遥测设备、以及六百马力的电传动内燃机车的模型。中小学也有不少件产品达到或超过国际水平。
    由于教育与生产劳动相结合，学校里也掀起了群众性的教学大改革。仅天津师范大学即修改九十六种教学大纲，编写了六十九种教材。馆里展出了天津师大、南开等
  学校的教学大纲、教材等实物。
    在农业生产方面，学生们也大显身手。展出的有亩产三万零十二斤的高粱，亩产一万零八百零五斤的玉米，有亩产皮棉二千五百斤的棉花和亩产五万斤的蕃茄，还有蔬菜、水果等“卫星”。（附图片）
