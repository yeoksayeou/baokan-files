The busy season of autumn harvest and planting has arrived. Recently, early autumn crops have been harvested in various places, and the task of deep plowing wheat fields in wheat-producing areas has been about half completed. However, judging from the current situation in various regions, how to ensure the successful completion of the entire autumn harvest and planting tasks is a major issue in agricultural production at present.

The labor force in rural areas is relatively tight at present. Most areas have paid attention to overall arrangements, with steel production being tightly grasped, and the progress of autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting being rapid. In some places, there is a lack of overall arrangements in terms of labor, which will affect the autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting work. This phenomenon has already appeared. For example, in many places, grains have ripened but have not been harvested in time, resulting in lodging, grain loss, and germination. In some places, cotton has been spitting out a large amount of fiber, but it has not been picked in time. A lot of fertilizer needed for autumn planting has been accumulated in various places, but it has not been transported to the fields in time. These situations deserve attention.

Whether the autumn harvest work is done well is related to this year's bumper harvest. This year's autumn bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion, but part of the fruits of the bumper harvest are still in the fields, and are likely to suffer from wind, rain, frost and other disasters at any time. The vast number of farmers have worked hard for a year, for the sake of this harvest fruit. In this final stage, all localities must organize forces to rush and carefully harvest, ensure timely harvest, and ensure that every grain is stored in the granary, and must not allow the fruits of the harvest to suffer any loss. In the harvesting work, special attention should be paid to potatoes and cotton. This year, the planting area of ​​potatoes has expanded by 100 million mu compared with last year, and the output of potatoes may account for one-third of the total grain output in the autumn harvest. If the potato harvesting work is delayed slightly, the potatoes will rot in the ground; if the storage work does not keep up, it will greatly increase the loss of potatoes. Therefore, there must be no negligence in the collection and processing of potatoes. This year's cotton is growing better than in any previous year, but because the picking work is far behind, the progress of cotton purchasing is not as good as last year. In short, every people's commune must make careful arrangements for the harvesting of various crops according to the time of maturity, to ensure that each crop can be harvested and brought home on schedule.

In order to ensure a greater bumper harvest next summer, we must do a good job in deep plowing of the land and sowing wheat and rapeseed. First of all, it is necessary to ensure that the wheat field area is appropriately expanded, and at the same time, we must carefully carry out deep plowing, apply sufficient base fertilizer, sow in a timely manner, and achieve close planting and full seedlings. In addition, in concentrated cotton-producing areas, we must also make overall arrangements for the production layout and reserve cotton fields, so that we can achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest of grain, cotton, and oil next year.

In the case of insufficient labor, it is impossible to ensure both the leap forward in steel production and the on-time completion of the autumn harvest and planting tasks without the overall arrangement of the Party committee. Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "While vigorously producing steel, do not lose sight of agriculture. The people's communes must grow wheat well, grow rapeseed well, and deeply plow the land well. The tasks in agriculture in 1959 should have a greater leap forward than in 1958. To this end, the labor force in industry and agriculture should be well organized, and the people's communes should be widely promoted." The leading organs in various localities must make comprehensive arrangements in accordance with the principles instructed by Chairman Mao. Each region, while first ensuring the needs of steel production, organizes all available labor to invest in autumn harvesting and planting. Guizhou Province has 8 million laborers in rural areas. In addition to meeting the needs of the industrial front, there are still 5 million people in agriculture. Together with organs, schools, troops, and urban residents, the province can have about 6 million people invested in autumn harvesting and planting. Calculated at half a mu per person per day, 2.8 million to 3 million mu can be harvested every day, and it can be roughly completed in ten days. Therefore, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee decided that the province would work hard for half a month to complete the harvesting of rice and corn. The Provincial Party Committee also decided that during the concentrated autumn harvest period, commune-run sideline occupations, commune-run industries unrelated to steel, and everything that can be postponed shall be suspended for half a month as appropriate. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee also decided to extensively organize large-scale collaboration in labor and tools, so that late-maturing areas and early-maturing areas, mountainous areas and plains support each other, which is beneficial to both parties. In this way, a reliable guarantee is provided for the completion of the autumn harvest and planting tasks.

The more insufficient the labor force, the more necessary it is to intensify the promotion of advanced tools. At present, the transportation task is very tight, and all localities must continue to vigorously promote the ball bearingization of transportation tools. Many advanced tools for deep plowing of land have also appeared one after another recently, and we should take the method of rushing for a few days and nights to rush to make and promote these advanced tools. In this work, special efforts should be made to vigorously promote the most effective deep plowing machine - the rope traction machine. At present, Jiangsu Province has manufactured and promoted more than 600,000 rope traction machines, which has greatly accelerated the progress of autumn plowing. Other regions should also intensify their efforts in manufacturing and promoting this kind of machinery.

### 秋收秋种一定要搞好

    秋收秋种一定要搞好
    繁忙的秋收、秋种的季节已经到来。最近各地早秋作物已经收完了，产麦区的麦田深耕任务已经完成了一半左右。但是，从目前各地的情况看来，如何确保整个秋收、秋种任务的胜利完成，是当前农业生产上一个重大的问题。
    目前农村中的劳动力是比较紧张的，多数地区注意了全面安排，钢铁抓得紧，秋收、秋耕、秋种工作进度也快。有些地方，在劳力方面缺乏全面安排，就会影响到秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。现在已经出现了这种现象。例如不少地方谷物成熟了，没有及时收割，发生了倒伏、落粒、发芽等现象。有些地方棉花已经大量吐絮，却没有及时采摘。秋种所需的肥料，各地已经积了不少，但是还没有及时运到地里。这些情况是值得引起注意的。
    秋收工作做得好不好，关系着今年的大丰收。今年秋季的大丰收已成定局，但是大丰收的一部分果实还在田野上，随时都可能遭受风吹雨打霜冻等灾害。广大农民辛辛苦苦地奋战了一年，为的就是这个丰收果实。在这最后一关，各地要组织力量抢收、细收，保证及时收获，做到颗粒归仓，决不能让丰收果实遭受任何损失。在收获工作中，特别要注意的是薯类和棉花。今年的薯类栽种面积比去年扩大了一亿亩，薯类产量可能占秋收全部粮食产量的三分之一。而收薯工作稍一迟缓，薯类就会烂在地里；贮藏工作跟不上，也会大大增加薯类的损耗。因此，对于薯类的收藏和加工工作，决不能有任何疏忽。今年棉花长得比以往任何一年都好，但是由于摘花工作远远落在后面，棉花收购工作的进展还不如去年。总之，每一个人民公社都必须对各种农作物的收获，按照成熟期的早晚，作出周密的安排，保证每一种农作物都能如期收获到家。
    为了确保明年夏季更大的丰收，必须把深翻土地和小麦、油菜播种工作做好。这里首先必须保证适当地扩大麦田面积，同时要认真做好深耕，施足底肥，及时播种，并且做到密植、全苗。此外，在棉花集中产区，还要全面安排生产布局，预留棉田，这样明年才能实现粮、棉、油全面丰收。
    在劳动力不足的情况下，既要保证钢铁生产跃进，又要保证秋收、秋种任务按期完成，没有党委的全面安排是不行的。毛主席最近指示我们说：“在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉了。人民公社一定要把小麦种好，把油菜种好，把土地深翻好。1959年农业方面的任务，应当比1958年有一个更大的跃进。为此，应当把工业方面和农业方面的劳动力好好组织起来，人民公社应当普遍推广。”各地领导机关必须根据毛主席指示的原则，作全面的安排。每个地区在首先保证钢铁生产需要的前提下，组织一切可以动员的劳动力投入秋收秋种工作。贵州省农村有八百万劳动力，除开满足工业战线的需要外，农业方面还有五百万人，加上机关、学校、部队、城镇居民等，全省大约可以有六百万人投入秋收、秋种。以每人每天割半亩计算，每天可收割二百八十万到三百万亩，十天就可大体完成。因此贵州省委决定全省苦战半月，完成水稻、玉米收割任务。省委还决定：在突击秋收期间，社办副业、与钢铁无关的社办工业和一切可以缓办的事，都酌情暂停半月。同时，省委还决定广泛组织劳动力、工具方面的大协作，做到晚熟地区和早熟地区、山区和平原互相支援，双方有利。这样，就为完成秋收、秋种任务提供了可靠的保证。
    越是劳动力不足，越需要加紧推广先进工具。目前运输任务十分紧张，各地必须继续大力推行运输工具滚珠轴承化。深翻土地方面的先进工具最近也先后出现了不少，应当采取突击几昼夜的办法赶制和推广这些先进工具。在这个工作中，特别要大力推广最有效的深耕机械——绳索牵引机。目前江苏省已制造出和推广绳索牵引机六十多万部，大大加快了秋耕的进度。其他地区也应当在制造和推广这种机械方面加紧努力。
