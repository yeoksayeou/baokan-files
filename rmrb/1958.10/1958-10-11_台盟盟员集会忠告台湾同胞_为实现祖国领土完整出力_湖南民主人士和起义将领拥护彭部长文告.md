Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League members in Beijing gathered on the evening of the 9th, warmly endorsing Minister Peng Dehuai's "Message to Taiwan Compatriots," and hoping that Taiwan compatriots will unite to break free from the shackles of American imperialism as soon as possible. The meeting was jointly convened by the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the Beijing branch.

Those present unanimously agreed that Minister Peng Dehuai's proclamation fully embodies the infinite concern of the people of the motherland for the Taiwan compatriots. They hoped that Taiwan compatriots would quickly unite and contribute their strength to the realization of the motherland's territorial integrity. Chen Wenbin, Su Ziheng, Wang Wande, Wei Zhengming and others, in their respective speeches, all condemned the United States for playing with "ceasefire" and creating a "two Chinas" conspiracy. They pointed out that there is no war between China and the United States, so there is no question of a "ceasefire." The United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas," which even the Taiwan authorities dare not echo, is doomed to failure. The only way out for the American aggressors is "the best of the Thirty-Six Stratagems is to leave." American imperialism must get out of Taiwan, otherwise it will be strangled in the Taiwan Strait region.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 10th: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a forum on the 9th to discuss Minister Peng's "Message to Taiwan Compatriots." The heads of the Hunan Provincial and Changsha Municipal local organizations of various democratic parties and uprising generals who attended the meeting unanimously endorsed the measures taken by the government to peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue, and hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan would make a prompt decision and turn back as soon as possible.

Tang Shengzhi, former Director-General of the Kuomintang Training Directorate-General, currently Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Vice Governor of Hunan Province, said that Minister Peng's "Message to Taiwan Compatriots" is truly benevolent and righteous, and any Chinese person with a bit of patriotism should respond to this call from the motherland. For American imperialism, the best policy is to leave quickly. Otherwise, the noose of justice is merciless.

Fang Dingying, former Education Director of the Kuomintang Huangpu Military Academy and Chairman of the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said: The Taiwan military and political authorities should stand on a patriotic standpoint and no longer be confined to prejudices or misled by rumors, stubbornly refusing to come to their senses. He said that patriotism does not distinguish between who comes first and who comes later, and he hoped that the Taiwan authorities would not miss the opportunity to resolutely break free from the clutches of American imperialism, hold peaceful negotiations with the motherland government, and realize the reunification of the motherland as soon as possible.

Zhang Jitai, an uprising division commander and Standing Committee member of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, said that the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu is China's internal affair and will not allow interference from others. The Taiwan authorities should seize the opportunity and break free from the constraints of American imperialism.

Those present also stated that they would write letters to old friends in Taiwan to advise them to turn back as soon as possible.

    台盟盟员集会忠告台湾同胞
    为实现祖国领土完整出力
    湖南民主人士和起义将领拥护彭部长文告
    新华社10日讯　在北京的台湾民主自治同盟盟员9日晚集会，热烈拥护彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书，并希望台湾同胞团结起来早日挣脱美帝国主义的枷锁。会议是由台盟总部和北京市支部联合召集的。
    到会者一致认为，彭德怀部长的文告充分体现了祖国人民对台湾同胞的无限关怀。他们希望台湾同胞迅速团结起来，为实现祖国领土完整而贡献自己的力量。陈文彬、苏子蘅、王万得、魏正明等人在先后发言中，都一致谴责美国玩弄“停火”和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他们指出，中国同美国之间并没有战争，根本谈不上什么“停火”。美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，连台湾当局也不敢附和，是注定要失败的。美国侵略者的唯一出路是“三十六计，走为上计”。美帝国主义必须滚出台湾，否则将被绞死在台湾海峡地区。
    新华社长沙10日电　政协湖南省委员会9日集会座谈彭部长的告台湾同胞书。到会的各民主党派湖南省和长沙市地方组织负责人和起义将领，一致拥护政府为和平解决台湾问题而采取的措施，并希望台湾军政人员当机立断，及早回头。
    原国民党训练总监部总监、现政协湖南省委员会副主席、湖南省副省长唐生智说，彭部长的告台湾同胞书，真是仁至义尽，稍有一点爱国心的中国人，都应当响应祖国这一号召。对美帝国主义来说，赶快走为上策。不然，正义的绞索是无情的。
    原国民党黄埔军校教育长、民革长沙市委员会主任委员方鼎英说：台湾军政当局应当站在爱国立场上，不要再囿于成见，惑于谣言，长此执迷不悟。他说，爱国是不分先后的，希望台湾当局勿失良机，毅然摆脱美帝国主义魔掌，同祖国政府举行和平谈判，早日实现祖国统一。
    起义师长、政协湖南省委员会常务委员张际泰说，解放台、澎、金、马是我国内政，决不容许他人干涉。台湾当局应当抓住时机，摆脱美帝国主义的约束。
    到会的人还表示要写信给台湾旧友，规劝他们及早回头。
