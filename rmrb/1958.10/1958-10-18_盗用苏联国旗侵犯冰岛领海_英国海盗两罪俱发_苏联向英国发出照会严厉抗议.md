Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: TASS, Moscow – The Soviet Foreign Ministry delivered a note to the British Embassy in Moscow on October 16, protesting the British fishing vessels flying the Soviet flag while fishing within Iceland's twelve-nautical-mile fishing zone.

The note pointed out that, according to official information obtained by the Soviet Embassy in Reykjavik from the Icelandic Coast Guard, the British fishing vessel "Kep Paleese N-354" flew the Soviet flag while fishing within Iceland's twelve-nautical-mile fishing zone on September 26, 30 and October 1 of this year.

The Icelandic patrol boat "Top" witnessed this illegal act by the British fishing vessel and at that time brought it to the attention of the captain of the British warship "Dianna D-126", which was stationed near the fishing vessel, but the captain of the "Dianna" did not take the necessary measures.

The note pointed out that this British fishing vessel stole the Soviet flag when they invaded the Icelandic fishing zone, which is particularly intolerable and a provocative act. The note also pointed out that the above-mentioned actions of the British fishing vessel were carried out with the open connivance of the British warship command.

The note said that, considering the above circumstances, the Soviet Foreign Ministry believes that the British authorities should be held responsible for the illegal use of the Soviet flag by the British fishing vessel, and hereby lodges a protest, and hopes that the British authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from recurring in the future.

    盗用苏联国旗侵犯冰岛领海
    英国海盗两罪俱发
    苏联向英国发出照会严厉抗议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部10月16日交给英国驻莫斯科大使馆一封照会，抗议英国渔船打着苏联国旗在冰岛十二海里捕鱼区范围内捕鱼。
    照会指出，根据苏联驻雷克雅未克大使馆自冰岛海岸警卫队获得的正式情报，英国渔船“克普·帕利塞N—354号”于今年9月26日、30日和10月1日打着苏联的国旗在冰岛十二海里捕鱼区范围内捕鱼。
    冰岛的警卫船“托普”号看到英国渔船的这种非法行为，当时曾提请停在渔船近傍的英国军舰“迪安纳D—126”号舰长注意，但是，“迪安纳”号舰长却没有采取应有的措施。
    照会指出，这只英国渔船是在他们侵犯冰岛捕鱼区的时候盗用苏联国旗的，这种行动是特别不能容忍的，而且是一种挑衅行为。照会还指出，英国渔船的上述行动是在英国军舰指挥部的公开纵容下干出来的。
    照会说，考虑到上述情况，苏联外交部认为英国当局应该对英国渔船非法冒用苏联国旗的上述事件负责，为此特提出抗议，并希望英国当局采取必要的措施，今后不许类似事件重复发生。
