    The Latest and Most Beautiful Songs and Dances
    —Thoughts on Watching the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe's Performance
    Lü Ji
    We listened to the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe’s performance with excitement, like emerging from a stuffy hall and being greeted by a cool night breeze – refreshing and delightful. Their singing, so optimistic and full of a spirit of courageous advancement, filled us with boundless strength. It should be said that several recent People's Commune performances have given me the same feeling, but this performance moved me particularly deeply.
    Although labor has always occupied an important place in folk songs, in the past folk songs sung by the working people were rarely without a sense of bitterness and pain. Today, however, since the working people have been liberated from their exploited and enslaved status, especially under the leadership of the Party and illuminated by the brilliant light of the General Line, after breaking with superstition and liberating their minds, when the working people see the many miracles they have created through their labor, singing about labor no longer carries any bitterness or pain, and truly becomes a song of joy and freedom! Although songs of labor have always expressed the optimism of the working people, they have never been as bold and full of ideals as today's songs. Although our ancestors created countless beautiful and heartwarming folk melodies, they are not as enthusiastic, emotionally surging, and full of the Leap Forward spirit as today’s songs, which have never been seen before. These new folk songs did not arise before liberation, nor in the early days of liberation, but today, after the socialist revolution has basically achieved victory. This precisely shows that only after collective and all-people ownership have replaced individual ownership, collective labor has created countless miracles and emitted amazing brilliance, labor has gained true social significance, and creativity has been increasingly displayed; that is to say, only when the working people's thoughts and spirit are no longer bound by exploited labor, and become free and creative wings flying forward together, can these unprecedented, vibrant, and creative poems be produced.
    This new spirit is not only reflected in the songs and dances created by the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe, but also clearly reflected in their performance. This is easy to understand. Socialist thought has sent out strong branches and leaves everywhere in the lives of commune members and factory workers, and communist thought has also begun to develop rapidly. Therefore, whether it is "Song of the Five Iron and Steel Sisters," "The General Line Radiates Light," "Many New Things in the New Era," "Fourth Sister and Fifth Sister are Close Sisters," "Everyone Fights for Steel," or "Lazy Wife" and "Pounding Rammer Song," they all, with their latest ideological content and most beautiful artistic forms, infect and inspire the audience. Although some of these songs utilize original folk melodies, and some have hardly been changed, or only slightly modified, they have completely changed their original appearance because they are combined with new content and creatively performed by singers standing at the forefront of life. Here we see the influence of life content on the development of art forms.
    In addition to the participation of a small number of professional art cadres, the performance of the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe also shows the improving role played by professional art cadres in guiding amateur artistic activities. Undoubtedly, amateur artistic activities need the guidance of professional art workers at any time. Some comrades, because they want to emphasize that professional art cadres should learn from the masses, are unwilling to point out or belittle the guiding role that professional art work should have on amateur artistic activities, which is wrong. Of course, it is necessary to resolutely oppose and thoroughly criticize those who use bourgeois or petty-bourgeois viewpoints to carry out guidance, which will only lead the masses' amateur artistic activities onto the bourgeois literary and artistic path, and can only lead the masses' amateur artistic activities to degeneration. In the program performed by the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe, certain parts of individual programs, such as the melody of the song "Forty Years Younger," make me feel that it is not a form that the masses like to hear, and it is mixed with some student tone, which is worthy of vigilance from the comrades responsible for the guidance.
    The performance of the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe and the performances of other People's Commune song and dance troupes, like folk songs, show that our literary and artistic work has begun a new era. In this era, the masses will not appear on the historical stage as appreciators of literature and art, but as creators of literature and art. In the future, the amateur literary and artistic creation of the masses will become an extremely important part of the entire literary and artistic field. The development and prosperity of mass amateur literary and artistic creation, of course, does not mean the decline of professional literary and artistic creation. On the contrary, it is precisely a sign of the higher stage of development of professional literary and artistic creation, because only popularization under improved guidance can continue to develop and prosper. On the other hand, the rapid development of mass amateur literary and artistic creation will inevitably promote the development of professional literary and artistic creation to a higher level, because the improvement of professional literary and artistic creation is based on popularization. Therefore, the success of the Shandong Leap Forward Song and Dance Troupe and other People's Commune song and dance troupes shows the development and victory of the Party's literary and artistic work in following the mass line, and also clearly marks the further development and new victory of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies.

    最新、最美的歌舞
    ——看山东跃进歌舞团表演的感想
    吕骥
    我们兴奋地听了山东跃进歌舞团的演唱，正像我们从闷热的大厅中走出来，迎面吹来一阵清凉的夜风似的，清新可喜；那样乐观、充满着勇往直前的精神的演唱，听了令人觉得增添了无限力量。应该说，最近好几次人民公社的演出都给了我相同的感受，不过这个演出给我的感受特别深。
    尽管劳动从来在民歌中占有重要地位，但过去劳动人民歌唱劳动的民歌很少不是充满着辛酸和痛苦，而今天，当劳动人民从被剥削、被奴役的地位中解放出来以后，特别是在党的领导下，在总路线的思想光辉照耀下，打破了迷信，解放了思想以后，当劳动人民看到了经过自己的劳动，创造了许多奇迹的时候，歌唱劳动就不再带有任何辛酸痛苦的成分，真正成为充满着欢乐而自由的歌声了！尽管歌唱劳动的歌声从来就表现了劳动人民的乐观主义精神，却没有像今天的歌声这样豪迈而富于理想。尽管我们祖祖辈辈的劳动人民创造了无数优美沁人肺腑的民歌曲调，却不像今天的歌声这样热情洋溢、情绪奔腾、具有亘古以来所不曾见过的跃进精神。这些新民歌不产生在解放以前，也不产生在解放初期，而是产生在社会主义革命基本上取得了胜利之后的今天，正说明了是在以集体所有制和全民所有制代替了个人所有制之后，集体劳动创造了无数奇绩，放射了惊人的光辉，劳动具有了真实的社会意义，日益显示了创造性的时候，即是说，只有在劳动人民的思想精神不再为被剥削的劳动束缚住，成为自由的富于创造性的劳动的翅膀一同向前飞驰的时候，才能产生这些前所未有的、充满着生命力和创造性的诗篇。
    这种新的精神不仅反映在山东跃进歌舞团所表演的歌曲、舞蹈创作中，同样鲜明地反映在他们的表演里，这是很容易理解的，社会主义的思想在公社社员和工厂工人的生活中到处发出了茁壮的枝叶，共产主义思想也开始在迅速地发展，所以不论是“钢铁五姊妹之歌”、“总路线放光芒”、“新时代新事多”、“四姐五姐本是亲姐妹”、“人人为钢铁而战”，还是“懒老婆”、“打夯号子”，同样，以它们最新的思想内容和最美的艺术形式感染着听众，给听众以鼓舞。虽然其中有些歌曲利用了原来的民歌曲调，虽然有的几乎完全没有改动，或者只作了不多的改动，由于和新的内容结合了，经过那些站在生活最前线的歌手的表演创造，完全改变了原来的面貌。这里使我们看到生活内容对于艺术形式发展所发生的影响。
    山东跃进歌舞团的表演，除了有少部分专业文艺干部参加演出之外，也还可以看出专业文艺干部平时对于业余文艺活动进行辅导所起的提高作用。无疑地，业余文艺活动任何时候都需要专业文艺工作干部去进行辅导。有些同志由于想强调专业文艺干部向群众学习，不愿意指明或贬低专业文艺工作对于业余文艺活动应有的指导作用，那是不对的。当然，对于那些以资产阶级或小资产阶级观点去进行辅导是必须坚决反对，彻底批判，那样只会把群众业余文艺活动引导到资产阶级文艺道路上去，只能引导群众业余文艺活动走向变质。在山东跃进歌舞团表演的节目中有个别节目的某些部分如“年轻了四十年”这首歌曲的曲调使我觉得还不完全是群众喜闻乐见的形式，其中掺杂了一些学生腔，这是值得负责辅导的同志警惕的。
    山东跃进歌舞团的表演和其他地方人民公社歌舞团的表演也像民歌一样显示了我们的文艺工作开始了一个新的时代，这个时代群众将不是以文艺的欣赏者出现在历史舞台上，而是以文艺的创造者出现在历史舞台上。群众的业余文艺创作今后在整个文艺领域中将成为极其重要的一个组成部分。群众业余文艺创作的发展、繁荣，当然不是意味着专业文艺创作的衰落，正相反，恰恰是专业文艺创作的更高阶段发展的一个标记，因为只有在提高指导下的普及才有可能继续不断地发展、繁荣。而另一方面，群众业余文艺创作迅速地向前发展，必然要推动专业的文艺创作向更高的水平发展，因为专业文艺创作的提高是以普及作为基础的。所以山东跃进歌舞团和其他人民公社的歌舞团表演的成功，正显示了党的文艺工作走群众路线的发展和胜利，也鲜明地标志了党中央和毛主席所指示的文艺方针取得了进一步的发展和新的胜利。
