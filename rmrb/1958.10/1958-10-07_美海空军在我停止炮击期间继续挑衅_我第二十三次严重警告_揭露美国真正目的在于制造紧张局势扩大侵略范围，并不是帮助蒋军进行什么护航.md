Xinhua News Agency, 6th — Between 1:00 and 18:00 on October 6th, eight U.S. warships and thirteen aircraft intruded into the territorial waters and airspace over the Fujian region of our country. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to state: At 1:00 on October 6th, Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai issued a message to compatriots in Taiwan, clearly announcing that, for humanitarian reasons, our front line in Fujian would, starting from October 6th, temporarily cease bombardment for seven days, during which Chiang Kai-shek's troops could freely transport supplies, but on the condition that there be no U.S. escort. Now, during the period when our army has ceased bombardment of Jinmen, U.S. warships and aircraft are still continuing to intrude into our country's territorial waters and airspace. This makes it even clearer that the U.S.'s true aim is to constantly create tension and expand the scope of aggression, and not to help Chiang Kai-shek's troops with some escort. Regarding this blatant military provocation by the United States, the Chinese government lodges its twenty-third serious warning.

    美海空军在我停止炮击期间继续挑衅
    我第二十三次严重警告
    揭露美国真正目的在于制造紧张局势扩大侵略范围，并不是帮助蒋军进行什么护航
    新华社6日讯　10月6日一时至十八时，美国军舰八艘，飞机十三架，侵入我国福建地区的领海和领海上空。我外交部发言人奉命声明：10月6日一时，我国防部部长彭德怀发表了告台湾同胞书，明确宣布，为了人道主义，我福建前线，从10月6日起，暂以七天为期，停止炮击，蒋介石军队可以充分地自由地输送供应品，但以没有美国人护航为条件。现在，在我军停止炮击金门期间，美国军舰、飞机仍然继续侵入我国领海和领海上空，这就更加清楚地说明，美国的真正目的是在于不断制造紧张局势和扩大侵略范围，并不是帮助蒋介石军队进行什么护航。对于美国这种露骨的军事挑衅，中国政府第二十三次提出严重警告。
