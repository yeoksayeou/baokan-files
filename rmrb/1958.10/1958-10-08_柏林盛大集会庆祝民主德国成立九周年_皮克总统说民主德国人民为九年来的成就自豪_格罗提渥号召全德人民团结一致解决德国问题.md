Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th October: On the occasion of celebrating the ninth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, President Wilhelm Pieck published a letter to the citizens of the country. The letter stated that in celebrating the birthday of our young worker-peasant state, we have every right to be proud of the achievements we have made in the past few years. In the past few years, no capitalist country can compare with us in terms of the growth rate of industrial production. Our agricultural production is already higher than that of West Germany. Our trade with countries around the world is constantly expanding. Our republic has become an important political and economic force in the world, and its international prestige is constantly growing.

The letter to the citizens continued, stating that the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has presented us with a great program of peace, happiness, and socialism. The realization of this program will prove to the working people of West Germany that life in a worker-peasant state is much better than in a country ruled by monopoly capitalists and landlords.

President Pieck called on all citizens to actively participate in the upcoming elections for the People's Chamber, saying that our elections will prove to the enemies of the worker-peasant regime and the German people that the unity between the government and the people of the German Democratic Republic is unbreakable.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th October: 1,500 representatives from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic held a grand rally in the German State Opera in Berlin today to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

When Deputy Prime Minister Scholz spoke at the meeting about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, he reiterated that the government and working people of the German Democratic Republic resolutely support the just struggle of the Chinese people. He said that the government and all working people of the German Democratic Republic, together with the great Soviet Union and all other countries of the socialist family, stand firmly on the side of the Chinese people. Today, we once again assure the Chinese people that the German Democratic Republic will do everything in its power to support the Chinese people's just struggle against the provocations and aggression of US imperialism against China.

The celebration was opened by the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl. After delivering the opening speech, he issued a statement on behalf of the Republic's government regarding the solution to the German question. The statement reiterated the firm position of the German Democratic Republic government on resolving this issue.

In his statement, Grotewohl called on all the people of the two Germanys to act together and work together to guide the German national question out of the dead end. He suggested that the National Front of the German Democratic Republic unite all peace-loving and patriotic forces in the German Democratic Republic and throughout Germany, and lead them to act together to realize the peace proposals of the German Democratic Republic government. He said that only when all the German people act together can the obstacles currently preventing the governments of the two Germanys from reaching mutual understanding be eliminated. Only in this way can the German people and all European people eliminate the threat of a new war.

Grotewohl condemned the Adenauer government for stubbornly pursuing a policy of atomic rearmament and refusing to hold negotiations with the German Democratic Republic on the issue of a German peace treaty. He also condemned the US, British, and French governments for rudely rejecting the German Democratic Republic government's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. He emphasized that in order to guide the German question out of the dead end and to eliminate the division between the two Germanys, it is necessary to: (1) withdraw all foreign troops from Germany, and the West German Bundestag must cancel the resolution on equipping the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons; (2) abolish the obligations undertaken by the two Germanys in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty Organization; (3) Germany must participate in a Central European nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Subsequently, Deputy Prime Minister Scholz delivered a report on the ninth anniversary of the National Day. In his report, Scholz reviewed the significant achievements made by the German Democratic Republic in the political, economic, cultural, and scientific fields over the past nine years. He emphasized that the German Democratic Republic has now become the foundation for the reunification of Germany and a strong bulwark for maintaining peace.

Scholz resolutely condemned the US military provocation against China in the Taiwan Strait. He pointed out that the current aggression of US imperialism against the Chinese people is once again pushing the people of all countries into the danger of war. He said that if all peace-loving people unite and fight for peace, then the aggression of the US imperialists against the great Chinese people will inevitably be defeated.

Scholz's report was warmly welcomed by the conference.

Subsequently, Prime Minister Grotewohl read out the congratulatory messages from the leaders of the Soviet Union and China to the party and government leaders of the German Democratic Republic, and announced the names of other countries that had sent congratulatory messages.

The conference unanimously adopted a telegram of thanks to the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union.

After the meeting, the German National Symphony Orchestra and other units performed artistic programs.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Walter Ulbricht, and Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber, Johannes Dieckmann, attended the celebration. Soviet Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic, Mikhail Pervukhin, Chinese Ambassador Wang Guoquan, and diplomatic envoys from other countries were also invited to attend the conference. Guests from West Germany were also warmly welcomed at the conference.

    新华社柏林7日电　德意志民主共和国总统皮克在庆祝德意志民主共和国成立九周年的时候，发表了告全国公民书。书中说，在欢庆我们年轻的工农国家诞生日子的时候，我们完全有权利为我们在过去几年中所取得的成就而感到自豪。过去几年中，在工业生产增长速度方面，任何资本主义国家都不能和我们相比。我们的农产品的生产量已经高于西德。我们同世界各国的贸易正在不断扩大。我们的共和国已经成为世界上重要的政治经济力量，它的国际威望正在不断增长。
    告全国公民书接着说，德国统一社会党第五次代表大会给我们提出了一个伟大的和平幸福和社会主义的纲领，这个纲领的实现将向西德劳动人民证明，在工农国家里生活要比在垄断资本家和地主统治的国家好得多。
    皮克总统号召全体公民积极参加即将到来的人民议院的选举，他说，我们的选举将向工农政权和德国人民的敌人证明，民主德国政府和人民之间的团结一致是牢不可破的。
    新华社柏林7日电　民主德国各界代表一千五百人今天在柏林德国国家歌剧院举行盛大集会，庆祝德意志民主共和国成立九周年。
    共和国副总理绍尔茨在会上谈到台湾海峡地区的局势时重申，民主德国政府和劳动人民坚决支援中国人民的正义斗争。他说，德意志民主共和国政府和全体劳动人民同伟大的苏联和社会主义大家庭所有其他国家一起，紧紧地站在中国人民一边。今天我们再一次向中国人民保证，民主德国将尽一切努力，支援中国人民为反对美帝国主义对中国的挑衅和侵略行为而进行的正义斗争。
    这次庆祝大会由民主德国总理格罗提渥主持开幕。他在致开幕词以后，代表共和国政府发表了一项关于解决德国问题的声明。声明中重申了民主德国政府在解决这个问题上的坚定立场。
    格罗提渥在声明中号召两个德国的全体人民一致行动起来，共同努力把德国的民族问题从死胡同中引导出来。他建议民主德国全国阵线团结民主德国和全德一切爱好和平和爱国的力量，领导他们为实现民主德国政府的和平建议而共同行动起来。他说，只有全体德国人民一致行动起来，才能消除目前阻止两个德国的政府相互谅解的障碍，也只有这样，德国人民和所有欧洲人民才能消除新战争的威胁。
    格罗提渥谴责阿登纳政府一意孤行地奉行原子备战政策和拒绝就对德和约问题同民主德国举行谈判，他并且谴责美英法三国政府粗暴地拒绝民主德国政府关于缔结对德和约的建议的态度。他强调指出，为了把德国问题从死胡同里引导出来，为了消弭两个德国之间的鸿沟，就必须：（一）使一切外国军队撤出德国，西德联邦议院必须取消关于以原子武器装备西德国防军的决议；（二）解除两个德国在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约组织中所承担的义务；（三）德国必须参加中欧无原子武器区。
    随后，绍尔茨副总理做了关于国庆九周年的报告。绍尔茨在报告中回顾了九年来民主德国在政治、经济、文化、科学各方面所取得的重大成就。他强调指出，民主德国今天已经成为德国重新统一的基础和维护和平的坚强堡垒。
    绍尔茨坚决谴责美国在台湾海峡地区对中国进行的军事挑衅。他指出，目前美帝国主义对中国人民的侵略，再一次把各国人民推向战争的危险中。他说，如果所有爱好和平的人们团结一致为和平而斗争，那么，美帝国主义者对伟大的中国人民的侵略也必将遭到不可避免的失败。
    绍尔茨的报告博得了大会的热烈欢迎。
    随后，格罗提渥总理向大会宣读了苏联和中国领导人给民主德国党政领导人的贺电，宣布了拍来贺电的其他国家的名字。
    大会最后一致通过了给苏联共产党和政府的感谢电。
