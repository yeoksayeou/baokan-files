Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 21st: Hubei Province, crisscrossed by rivers and lakes, had sent away the "plague god" in twenty-four counties and cities by the end of September. After inspection, Gucheng, Xiangyang, and Daye counties have eradicated schistosomiasis, and嘉鱼(Jiayu), 江陵(Jiangling), 洪湖(Honghu), 沔阳(Mianyang), 松滋(Songzi), and twenty-one other areas with severe epidemics have also basically eliminated schistosomiasis.

Schistosomiasis has been prevalent in Hubei Province for over a hundred years, affecting more than forty counties and cities. According to a typical survey, in Yangpei Township, Xinzhou County, with a population of over 12,000, more than 5,000 people died from this disease in the ten years before liberation. The masses described the tragic situation at that time as: "Father dies, no one carries the coffin; son dies, no one buries the body; foxes and rabbits appear in the village, and Artemisia grass grows all over the fields." But now, these places have become paradises of "abundant harvests and thriving livestock."

Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people of Hubei Province adopted the policy of combining prevention and treatment, attacking on both fronts, to eliminate schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis prevention workers closely integrated with production, guiding the masses to launch a campaign to eliminate Oncomelania snails and cercariae. At the same time, they adopted methods of mobile treatment and door-to-door medicine delivery to treat patients, and universally promoted the short-course antimony agent therapy. In the past, a patient had to be hospitalized for more than twenty days and spend more than ten yuan, but now they can receive treatment while continuing production, and each patient only spends a little more than five jiao to be cured. This medical method, which follows the mass line, has greatly improved the curative effect, and more than 330,000 people have been treated in the first nine months of this year.

### 群众路线施威　百年瘟神溃逃  湖北二十四个县市消灭血吸虫病

    群众路线施威　百年瘟神溃逃
    湖北二十四个县市消灭血吸虫病
    新华社武汉21日电　江湖密集的湖北省，到9月底为止已经有二十四个县市送走了“瘟神”。经过检查，谷城、襄阳、大冶三个县已根除血吸虫病，嘉鱼、江陵、洪湖、沔阳、松滋等二十一个疫情严重的地区也基本上消灭血吸虫病。
    湖北省血吸虫病已经流行了一百多年，遍及四十多个县市。据典型调查，有一万二千多人口的新洲县杨裴乡，在解放前的十年内，因患这种病症死去了五千多人。群众形容那时的惨状是：“爹死无人抬，儿死无人埋；村里出狐兔，遍野长蒿草。”而现在，这些地方都已变成了“五谷丰登，人畜两旺”的乐园。
    湖北省人民在各级党委领导下，采取了预防与治疗并进、两面夹击的方针，来消灭血吸虫病。血防工作人员紧密结合生产，指导群众展开了消灭钉螺、尾蚴的运动。与此同时，他们采取巡回治疗和送药上门的办法，为患者治疗，并普遍推行锑剂短程疗法。过去一个病人要住院二十多天、花十多元的费用，现在可以一边生产，一边治疗，每个病人只花五角多钱就治好了病。这一走群众路线的医疗方法，大大提高了疗效，今年头九个月就治疗了三十三万多人。
