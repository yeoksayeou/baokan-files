Xinhua News Agency, 28th: A grand rally of over ten thousand people from all walks of life in the capital was held this afternoon to warmly welcome the triumphant return of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Today's meeting was a grand occasion for the people of the motherland to cheer the great achievements of their outstanding sons and daughters, and also a demonstration by the Chinese people against American imperialist aggression.

Eight years ago, the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people went to war for peace, and today they return for peace. In the ten-thousand-person hall of the Beijing Gymnasium, people from all walks of life in the capital, including workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, warmly welcomed their most beloved people with boundless excitement.

At 4:40 pm, the delegation and song and dance troupe of the Volunteer Army entered the venue to the tune of "The Volunteer Army March." At this moment, the joyous and enthusiastic atmosphere in the venue reached its peak. The entire audience stood up and applauded warmly, with applause and slogans lasting for more than twenty minutes. Amidst enthusiastic cheers, hundreds of young pioneers, both boys and girls, rushed forward from all directions, presenting countless flowers to the most beloved people of the motherland. The heroes of the motherland were full of enthusiasm. They shouted "Long live the motherland!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The Volunteer Army March" and "Socialism is Good." The entire venue was immersed in a frenzy of joy.

A portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, was hung on the rostrum of the conference. The seats of the delegation and song and dance troupe of the Volunteer Army were surrounded by red silk symbolizing victory. Above the rostrum and on the tall roof beams opposite, huge red banners with gold characters were hung, reading: "Salute to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" "Long live the great victory of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement!" "Long live the militant friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea!" "We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu!" "American aggressors get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area!"

At 5:00 pm sharp, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Peng Zhen, Mayor of Beijing and Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Marshal of the People's Liberation Army, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, and others, accompanied Yang Yong, General, and Wang Ping, General, leading the Volunteer Army representatives, stepped onto the rostrum amidst warm applause. At this moment, the enthusiastic cheers, like spring thunder breaking through the clear sky, resounded endlessly, shaking the spacious hall of the entire gymnasium.

Also seated on the rostrum with Vice Chairman Zhu De and others were responsible persons from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the National Defense Council, various departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, various democratic parties, and Party and government organs and people's organizations in Beijing. They were: Li Jishen, Cheng Qian, Bao Erhan, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Zongxun, Gan Siqi, Liu Yalou, Wang Hongkun, Li Juikui, Hu Qiaomu, Liao Chengzhi, Cai Chang, Liu Changsheng, Hu Yaobang, Zhou Yang, Zhu Kezhen, Shi Liang, Hu Juewen, Wang Shao'ao, Ji Fang, Chen Qiyu, Xu Mengshan, Liu Ren, Wan Li, and Zhang Xiruo.

Also seated on the rostrum were Volunteer Army representatives Liang Biye, Wang Yunrui, Yan Jinsheng, You Haoyang, Liang Dichen, Wang Xuxian, Qi Dekuan, Wang Huyuan, Wang Zhanshan, Huang Zhifu, and Zhang Mingdi.

Also seated on the rostrum was the Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yonghao.

The entire Korean volleyball team currently visiting China, personnel from the Korean Embassy, all Korean students studying in China, and writer representatives from ten Asian and African countries were invited to attend today's welcoming rally.

The conference began after the solemn national anthem was played. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, delivered the opening speech amidst warm applause. He said, "Please allow me to announce that let our conference, on behalf of the 650 million people of the motherland, extend the warmest welcome, the highest respect, and the most heartfelt gratitude to the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland—all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation!" Before Guo Moruo's words could fade, the hall once again erupted in endless applause, like a surging sea.

Comrade Peng Zhen spoke amidst a storm of welcoming applause. Peng Zhen first, in the name of all the Chinese people, extended a warm welcome and congratulations to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which had made immortal contributions to the security of the motherland and to peace in the Far East and the world.

Peng Zhen said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is the honor of our motherland. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army embodies the infinitely heroic and fearless spirit of the Chinese people, and embodies the high patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese people. Everything the motherland has today is inseparable from the victory of the Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield.

Peng Zhen then elaborated on the historical significance of the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples. He said that the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples in resisting the American aggressors has led the people of the world to a unanimous conclusion: "American imperialism can be defeated." The conclusion that American imperialism is a paper tiger is of great significance to the people of the world. It has ideologically armed the people of the world. With this spiritual condition, the struggle of the people of the world against imperialist, mainly American imperialist, aggression and oppression will surely develop rapidly.

Peng Zhen said that the victory of the Korean and Chinese people is also the victory of the entire socialist camp. The Chinese people who, together with the Korean people, drove the American aggressors from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel will certainly be able to make the American aggressors get out of the Taiwan area. He said that the affairs of the Chinese people can only be solved by the Chinese people themselves, and the Americans have no right to interfere in the slightest. If the American aggressors insist on staying in Taiwan, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous and shameful defeats.

Korean Ambassador to China Li Yonghao, filled with passionate friendship, warmly welcomed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army back to their motherland. He said that the great achievements you have established in our country with blood and sweat have become a glorious example of lofty proletarian internationalism, deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Korean people, and will be passed down forever to future generations, and will be recorded in human history as a beautiful and splendid page.

He said that in the struggle against the common enemy, the great victory achieved by the troops of the Korean and Chinese peoples has completely shattered the so-called "powerful" myth of American imperialism, the chief culprit of world imperialism, and truly proved that no imperialist aggressor can stop the people who are closely united in the big family of the socialist camp from advancing.

Li Yonghao said that now, American imperialism continues to occupy South Korea, continues to occupy the sacred territory of Taiwan of the Chinese people, and recently has been carrying out criminal schemes to interfere in China's internal affairs in the Taiwan Strait and the Kinmen and Matsu areas, threatening world peace. If the American imperialists should forget the lessons of their disastrous defeat in the Korean War and continue to occupy South Korea and Taiwan and carry out war provocation schemes, then they will inevitably tighten the noose around their own necks and strangle themselves.

Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, took the stage with enthusiasm. Yang Yong said that your children, who have been away from you for a long time, have now all returned to the embrace of the motherland and to the side of their relatives. Yang Yong excitedly extended greetings to the relatives in the capital, greetings to Chairman Mao, and greetings to the leaders of the Party Central Committee! He cited facts to express the love and gratitude of the Volunteer Army commanders and fighters for the motherland and Chairman Mao, saying, "Strength comes from the motherland, and victory and honor come from Chairman Mao."

Yang Yong also spoke with deep gratitude about the great affection shown by the Korean people for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said that the heroic Korean people never shed a tear in the face of the cruel atrocities of the American army; but when they said goodbye to the Volunteer Army, they could not help but shed tears of farewell. The Korean people will surely achieve the expected victory in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and no one can stop the flesh-and-blood reunion of the 30 million compatriots in the North and South of Korea and the peaceful reunification of the three thousand miles of rivers and mountains.

At the end of his speech, Yang Yong sternly condemned the criminal acts of American imperialism in carrying out war threats in the Taiwan Strait area. He firmly said that we have great strength and firm confidence in maintaining the peace we have achieved and smashing any aggression. American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak internally, and no matter how it bares its teeth and claws, it can no longer scare anyone.

"We went abroad to participate in the war for peace, and we returned to the motherland for peace, but our love for peace and striving for peace is by no means begging for peace from the aggressors. Our tolerance for peace is limited. We have the firm determination and sufficient strength to teach the fire-playing warmongers a lesson when necessary."

General Yang Yong said: "If American imperialism is not reconciled to giving up aggression and wants to risk competing with us again, then it will not only lose troops and generals, but along with its failure in aggression will come the complete destruction of the entire American imperialism."

Finally, Yang Yong firmly stated: "Dear relatives, we are always ready to obey your call. As long as the motherland needs it, we will unreservedly contribute everything we have to our beloved motherland!"

Yang Yong's speech was constantly interrupted by stormy applause, and the people's fervent applause expressed firm support for these heroic words of the Volunteer Army heroes.

After the speech, amidst continuous applause from the audience, the Volunteer Army representatives presented flowers to Vice Chairman Zhu, Premier Zhou, and other Party and state leaders, as well as all members of the presidium of the conference. Peng Zhen and Guo Moruo, on behalf of the Chinese people, presented a banner to the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Peng Zhen, Guo Moruo, Yang Yong, and Wang Ping, along with others, held up a huge banner more than ten feet high. Under the strong light of the mercury lamps, every word on the banner radiated light: "You defeated the enemy, helped friends, defended the motherland, and saved peace. Your glorious name will last forever!" (Attached picture)

    打败了敌人、帮助了朋友、保卫了祖国、拯救了和平
    志愿军勋名万古存
    首都盛大集会向最可爱的人致敬，对美国侵略者示威
    新华社28日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天下午举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军凯旋归来。今天的大会是祖国人民欢呼自己优秀儿女的伟大功勋的一次盛会，也是中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义侵略的一次示威大会。
    八年以前，中国人民的英雄子弟为和平而出征，今天又为和平而归来。在北京体育馆的万人大厅里，首都工农商学兵各界人民，怀着无限激动的心情，热烈欢迎他们最可爱的人。
    下午四时四十分，志愿军代表团和文工团全体人员，在“志愿军战歌”的乐曲声中进入会场，这时，会场上欢腾热烈的气氛达到了顶点，全场起立热烈鼓掌，掌声和口号声一直持续了二十多分钟。在热烈的欢呼声中，几百名男女少先队员从四面八方拥上前去，把无数鲜花献给祖国最可爱的人。祖国的英雄们热情横溢，他们同祖国的亲人们热烈高呼“祖国万岁”、“毛主席万岁”，高唱“志愿军战歌”和
  “社会主义好”，整个会场浸入了一片狂热的欢乐中。
    大会主席台上悬挂着中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的画像。志愿军代表团和文工团全体人员的座位四周都缠绕着象征胜利的红绸。在主席台上方和对面的高大屋梁上，悬挂着巨幅的红底金字标语：“向英雄的中国人民志愿军致敬！”“伟大的抗美援朝运动胜利万岁！”“中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！”“一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖！”“美国侵略者从台湾和台湾海峡地区滚出去！”
    五时正，中华人民共和国副主席、中共中央副主席朱德，国务院总理、中共中央副主席周恩来，国务院副总理、中共中央副主席陈云，北京市市长、中共中央政治局委员彭真，国务院副总理、中共中央政治局委员陈毅元帅，中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若等陪同以杨勇上将和王平上将为首的志愿军代表一起，在热烈的掌声中步上主席台。这时，会场上就像划破晴空的春雷一般，热情的欢呼声经久不息地震撼着整个体育馆宽敞的大厅。
    同朱德副主席等一起在主席台上就座的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会、政协全国委员会、国防委员会、中国人民解放军各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派以及北京市党政机关和人民团体的负责人。他们是：李济深、程　潜、包尔汉、张治中、张宗逊、甘泗淇、刘亚楼、王宏坤、李聚奎、胡乔木、廖承志、蔡　畅、刘长胜、胡耀邦、周　扬、竺可桢、史　良、胡厥文、王绍鏊、季　方、陈其尤、徐萌山、刘　仁、万　里、张奚若。
    在主席台上就座的，还有志愿军代表梁必业、王蕴瑞、颜金生、游好扬、梁涤尘、王徐贤、齐德宽、王虎元、王占山、黄治富、张明弟。
    在主席台上就座的还有朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐。
    正在中国访问的朝鲜排球队全体人员，朝鲜大使馆人员，全体朝鲜留学生和来自亚非十个国家的作家代表，应邀出席了今天的欢迎大会。
    大会在高奏庄严的国歌以后开始。中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若在热烈掌声中致开会词，他说：“请允许我宣布，让我们的大会，代表祖国六亿五千万人民，向祖国的英雄儿女——中国人民志愿军全体指战员，向中国人民志愿军代表团全体同志，表示最热烈的欢迎、最崇高的敬意和最衷心的感谢！”郭沫若的话音未落，会场上就像汹涌的海潮一般，再一次响起了经久不息的掌声。
    彭真同志在暴风雨般的欢迎掌声中讲话。彭真首先以全中国人民的名义，对为祖国的安全、为远东和世界和平立下不朽功勋的中国人民志愿军，表示热烈的欢迎和庆贺。
    彭真说，中国人民志愿军是我们祖国的荣誉。中国人民志愿军体现了中国人民无比英勇的大无畏精神，体现了中国人民高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神。今天祖国的一切，都是同志愿军在朝鲜战场上的胜利分不开的。
    彭真接着讲述了中朝人民伟大胜利的历史意义。他说，中朝人民抗击美国侵略者的伟大胜利，使全世界人民得到了一致的结论：“美帝国主义是可以打败的”。美帝国主义是纸老虎这个结论，对于全世界人民具有极大的意义。它从思想上武装了全世界人民。有了这个精神条件，全世界人民反对帝国主义主要是美帝国主义侵略和压迫的斗争，就一定能够得到迅速的发展。
    彭真说，朝中人民的胜利，也就是整个社会主义阵营的胜利。同朝鲜人民一道把美国侵略者从鸭绿江赶回三八线的中国人民，也一定能够使美国侵略者从台湾地区滚出去。他说，中国人的事，只能由中国人自己解决，美国人丝毫无权过问。美国侵略者硬要赖在台湾不走，它必将遭到更加惨重、更加可耻的失败。
    朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐满怀着友谊的激情，热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军回到自己的祖国。他说，你们用鲜血和汗水在我国建立的丰功伟绩，已经成为崇高的无产阶级国际主义的光辉榜样，深深印在朝鲜人民的心坎上，子孙万代地永远传颂下去，并将作为美丽绚烂的一页，载入人类史册。
    他说，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，朝中人民部队取得的伟大胜利，彻底粉碎了世界帝国主义的元凶美帝国主义的所谓“强大”的神话，如实地证明了任何帝国主义侵略者也不能阻挡紧密团结在社会主义阵营大家庭中的人民前进。
    李永镐说，现在，美帝国主义继续侵占着南朝鲜，继续霸占着中国人民的神圣领土台湾，最近更在台湾海峡和金门、马祖地区进行干涉中国内政的罪恶策动，威胁世界和平。如果美帝国主义者竟然忘记了在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的教训，继续霸占南朝鲜和台湾，进行战争挑衅策动，那么不可避免地就会用自己的手拉紧绞索绞死自己。
    中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将怀着满腔的热情登台讲话，杨勇说，久别你们的儿女，现在已经全部回到了祖国的怀抱，回到了亲人的身边。杨勇激动地向首都亲人们问好，向毛主席问好，向党中央首长问好！他列举事实倾诉了志愿军指战员对祖国和毛主席的热爱和感激之情，他说，“力量来自祖国，胜利和荣誉来自毛主席”。
    杨勇还以深切感激的心情谈到了朝鲜人民对中国人民志愿军所表现的伟大感情。他说，英雄的朝鲜人民在美军残酷的暴行面前，从没有掉过一滴眼泪；可是他们在送别志愿军时，却禁不住流下了惜别的热泪。朝鲜人民在争取祖国和平统一的斗争中一定会取得预期的胜利，谁也阻挡不了朝鲜南北三千万同胞的骨肉团聚和三千里江山的和平统一。
    杨勇在讲话的最后，严厉地斥责美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区进行战争威胁的罪恶行为。他坚决地说，我们对维护已得的和平，粉碎任何的侵略，具有巨大的力量和坚强的信心。美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎，不管它怎样张牙舞爪，再也吓不倒任何人了。
    “我们是为和平而出国参战，又为和平而返回祖国，但我们热爱和平，力争和平，决不是向侵略者乞求和平，我们为和平而忍耐是有限度的，我们有坚强的决心，也有足够的力量在必要时用来教训战争的玩火者。”
    杨勇将军说：“美帝国主义如果不甘心于放弃侵略，而要冒险同我们再一次较量的话，那就将不仅仅是损兵折将而已，那时，连同他的侵略的失败一起到来的，将是整个美帝国主义的彻底毁灭。”
    杨勇最后坚决地表示说：“亲人们，我们时刻准备着听从你们的召唤。只要祖国需要，我们将毫不吝惜地把自己的一切贡献给我们亲爱的祖国！”
    杨勇的讲话不断为暴风雨般的掌声所打断，人们狂热的掌声表示坚决支持志愿军英雄的这些豪言壮语。
    讲话结束后，在全场连绵不断的掌声中，志愿军代表向朱副主席、周总理等党和国家领导人以及大会主席团全体人员献花，彭真和郭沫若代表中国人民向英勇的中国人民志愿军献旗。彭真、郭沫若、杨勇和王平等人一起把一丈多高的巨幅锦旗高高举起，在强烈的水银灯照耀之下，锦旗上的每一个字都发射着光彩：“你们打败敌人，帮助了朋友，保卫了祖国，拯救了和平。你们的勋名万古存！”（附图片）
