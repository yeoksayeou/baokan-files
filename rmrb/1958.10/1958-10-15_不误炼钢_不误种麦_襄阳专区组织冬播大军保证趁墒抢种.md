Not Delaying Steelmaking, Not Delaying Wheat Planting
    Xiangyang Special District Organizes Winter Sowing Army to Ensure Seizing Moisture for Timely Planting

    (Our Dispatch) Xiangyang Special District, Hubei Province, which this year has continuously launched high-yield wheat "satellites," is taking various measures to ensure the quality of wheat sowing and strive for a greater wheat harvest next year.

    The winter sowing area in Xiangyang Special District this year is 14 million mu, of which 10 million mu are planted with wheat. Currently, 8 million mu of land in the district has been deep-plowed. Fertilizer accumulation has increased more than tenfold compared to last year. However, more than half of the fertilizer has not yet been delivered to the fields, and more than 1 million mu of land that should be deep-plowed has not been deep-plowed in time. Of the land that has been deep-plowed, nearly 1 million mu is less than one foot deep and needs further deep plowing. To this end, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the recent meeting of the first secretaries of county party committees in the district, made a special study on the issue of arranging labor and ensuring the good planting of wheat and rapeseed. It was decided that in October, in addition to the 1.2 million laborers already on the steel front, the remaining 1.3 million laborers will fully invest in winter sowing. Taking the people's commune as a unit, a winter sowing army will be formed in the form of a military organization, launching a 20-day to one-month blitz to ensure that the base fertilizer is applied sufficiently at 1,000 dan per mu, and that all land that should be deep-plowed is deep-plowed to more than one foot. Ensure seizing the moisture and seizing the season. After the winter sowing blitz is completed, this labor army will then go to build water conservancy projects and railways. The advantage of this approach is that it does not delay steelmaking nor delay agricultural work. It is expected that wheat sowing in the district will be completed around the time of the Frost's Descent solar term.

    In order to ensure the quality of winter sowing, cadres in various places are vying to test sow, create models, and organize commune members to visit. Currently, 20,000 cadres in the district have trial-sown more than 20,000 mu.

    This year's winter sowing in Xiangyang Special District will vigorously promote the experience of close planting. The amount of wheat sown is required to be around 31 jin per mu, and most areas should adopt the method of cross-strip sowing. (Luo Zhongzhang)

### 不误炼钢　不误种麦  襄阳专区组织冬播大军保证趁墒抢种

    不误炼钢　不误种麦
    襄阳专区组织冬播大军保证趁墒抢种
    本报讯　今年小麦连续放出高产“卫星”的湖北省襄阳专区，正采取各种措施保证小麦播种质量，争取明年小麦更大丰收。
    襄阳专区今年冬播面积有一千四百万亩，其中有一千万亩是播种小麦。现在全区已深翻了的土地八百万亩。积肥比去年增加十多倍。但目前有半数以上的肥料尚未送到地里，还有一百多万亩应深翻的土地没有来得及深翻，已深翻过的土地中尚有近百万亩在一尺以下，有待进一步深翻。为此，中共襄阳地委在最近召开的全区各县县委第一书记会议上，对于安排劳力、保证把小麦、油菜种好的问题作了专门研究。决定在10月份内，除已在钢铁战线上的一百二十万劳力外，其余的一百三十万劳力全力投入冬播。以人民公社为单位，采取军事组织形式，组成一支冬播大军，突击二十天到一个月，保证底肥按每亩一千担施足，应深翻的土地都深翻在一尺以上。保证抢住墒，抢住季节。把冬播突击完了以后，这支劳动大军再分头去修水利，修铁路。这样做的好处是可以既不误钢铁，又不误农时。预计霜降前后全区小麦便可播种完毕。
    为了保证冬播质量，各地干部都争先试播，做出样板，组织社员参观。目前全区已有两万名干部试播了二万多亩。
    襄阳专区今年的冬播将大力推广密植的经验，小麦下种量要求每亩在三十一斤左右，绝大部分地区要采用交叉条播方法。（罗重璋）
