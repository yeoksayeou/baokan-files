Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th – The Guangdong local organizations of various democratic parties and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and other units have recently formed a steelmaking battalion and established a Red-Expert Steel Plant.

In order to implement the policy of the whole people running iron and steel, and to meet the requirements of members of these units to accelerate their self-transformation through productive labor, more than ten units, including the Guangdong local organizations of various democratic parties, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, the Guangdong Provincial Office of Councillors, and the Research Institute of Culture and History, decided to jointly establish a Red-Expert Steel Plant, and construction has recently begun. In addition to drawing a portion of members and full-time cadres as the backbone force of the Red-Expert Steel Plant, these units also formed a steelmaking battalion of more than 400 people to participate in labor at the factory in shifts. Many leaders of democratic parties, CPPCC members, councillors of the Office of Councillors, and researchers of the Research Institute of Culture and History have signed up to join the steelmaking battalion.

Luo Fanqun, Acting Director of the United Front Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), who is in charge of the leadership work of the steel plant's preparatory committee, and the heads of local organizations of various democratic parties in Guangdong, participate in the battle at the construction site almost every day, and sometimes fight through the night with everyone. Liang Shiji, Director of the Coking Workshop and Deputy Director of the Provincial Office of Councillors; Diao Shaofen, Director of the Steelmaking Workshop and Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA); Zeng Huiqi, Deputy Director of the Ironmaking Workshop and Standing Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK); Su Hanyan, Director of the Mechanical Repair Workshop and Standing Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League (CDL), and others, level the ground, transport materials, and crush ores with everyone every day.

"Making steel tempers people; people are redder than steel." In the process of building the factory and furnaces, they have received great education and training. Old gentlemen like Liang Tingwei, a researcher at the Research Institute of Culture and History, who were not accustomed to physical labor and collective life, were specially assigned light work by the factory leaders, but they asked to fight hard with everyone and requested to live a collective life at the construction site. Wu Jianwen, a researcher at the Provincial Office of Councillors, used to be somewhat dissatisfied with his salary and rank. Although he had changed somewhat after the rectification campaign, he still lacked enthusiasm. This time, after seeing everyone working actively without regard to remuneration, and especially after seeing the workers' strong support for the steel plant, he was greatly educated and completely changed his attitude towards work and labor. When the steel plant was installing converters and blowers, he took the initiative to participate in the design and installation work, fighting day and night with everyone.

After more than ten days of hard work, this steel plant has built two cupola furnaces, two converters, one indigenous blast furnace, and one coking furnace, and they have been put into production one after another.

    炉中炼钢  炉旁炼人
    广东民主党派满腔热情办钢厂
    新华社广州19日电　各民主党派广东省地方组织和政协广东省委员会等单位，最近组成了一个钢铁营，办了一个红专钢铁厂。
    各民主党派广东省地方组织、政协广东省委员会、广东省参事室、文史馆等十多个单位，为了贯彻全民办钢铁的方针，和满足这些单位的成员通过生产劳动加速自我改造的要求，决定联合筹建一个红专钢铁厂，并于最近开始施工。这些单位除抽调一部分成员和专职干部作为红专钢铁厂的基干队伍外，还组成一个四百多人的钢铁营，轮流下厂参加劳动。许多民主党派负责人、政协委员、参事室参事、文史馆馆员等都报名参加了钢铁营。
    参加钢铁厂筹委会领导工作的中共广东省委统战部代部长罗范群和各民主党派广东省地方组织负责人，几乎每天都在工地上参加战斗，有时还和大家一道苦战通宵。炼焦车间主任、省参事室副主任梁世骥，炼钢车间主任、民建广东省委副主委刁绍芬，炼铁车间副主任、民革广东省委常委曾会奇，机械修配车间主任、民盟广东省委常委苏翰彦等，每天都和大家一道平地基、运材料、打矿石。
      “炼钢也炼人，人比钢铁红”。在建厂建炉过程中，他们都受到了很大的教育和锻炼。文史馆馆员梁廷伟等老先生，一向对体力劳动和集体生活不习惯，厂的领导干部特意安排他们干轻活，但他们却要求和大家一道苦战，并要求到工地过集体生活。省参事室研究员吴剑文，过去对自己的薪金、级别有些不满，整风后虽然有所改变，但干劲还是不大。这次看到大家不计报酬积极劳动，特别是看到工人对钢铁厂的大力支援之后，受到很大教育，完全改变了对工作、劳动的态度。在钢铁厂安装转炉、鼓风机时，他主动要求参加设计、安装工作，和大家一道日夜苦战。
    这个钢铁厂经过十多天的日夜苦战，已经建起了两个冲天炉、两个转炉、一个土高炉和一个炼焦炉并已陆续开始投入生产。
