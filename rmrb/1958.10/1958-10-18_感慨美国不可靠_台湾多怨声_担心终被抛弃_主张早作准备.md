Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to reports, the resentment felt by the Taiwan authorities due to a series of recent actions by the United States is deepening. Taiwan newspapers believe that Taiwan is currently in a situation of "unpredictable international situation and ambiguous attitude of friendly countries," which makes "many people in Taiwan's military and political circles feel frustrated about the future of the war."

Since Dulles criticized Chiang Kai-shek's heavy troop deployment in Jinmen and Mazu as "stupid" at a press conference on September 30, and believed that Chiang Kai-shek's "counterattack against the mainland is hopeless," Taipei newspapers have made no secret of their vigilance against the United States' intention to abandon the Chiang Kai-shek group one day. Many Taiwan newspapers say that the minds of the current "international politicians" and "international appeasers" are full of "ugliness, selfishness, cowardice, and cruelty," and they are "relentlessly planning to take charge of the remaining limited wealth of Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) and give it away as a gift to others," a loyal friend. Taiwan's "New Life Daily" vaguely pointed out that the United States' attitude towards Jinmen and Mazu is actually the beginning of abandoning the Taiwan authorities. The editorial wrote that the United States "can think that Jinmen and Mazu are not important for defending Taiwan today as the situation continues to evolve, and tomorrow it can also think that Taiwan is not important. Frankly speaking, under the pretext of 'strategic value,' any region can be withdrawn from and demilitarized."

Many Taiwan newspapers believe that the current "Taiwan situation is treacherous and the atmosphere is gloomy," and the United States is really unreliable. Taiwan's "United Daily News" published an editorial on October 4 entitled "Looking at the United States' Policy with a Calm Attitude," saying, "Facing the current situation, it is a mistake to feel frustrated by the words and deeds of the US authorities, such as the reaction to Dulles's speech; similarly, it is also a mistake to feel elated by the words and deeds of the US authorities, such as the reaction to Eisenhower's last speech." The editorial expressed regret that the Taiwan authorities "discovered the United States' true attitude so late." It believes that "Dulles's speech in New York on September 25 was only one step away from saying the words 'neutralize Jinmen.' In particular, we should not be completely anesthetized by President Eisenhower's uncompromising speech and forget the dark corner of preparation for appeasement hidden beneath it." The editorial said that the Taiwan authorities' "understanding of US policy is often accustomed to wishful interpretation, often exaggerating the favorable parts and often ignoring the unfavorable parts, to the point where people doubt whether we possess a minimal ability to analyze and thoroughly understand US diplomatic documents." It is rumored in Taipei that a certain veteran of the Kuomintang, after hearing that the US Marine Corps and other ground forces had arrived in Taiwan under the pretext of participating in exercises and refused to leave, went to see Chiang Kai-shek and presented him with eight characters: "Sitting idly by while the fire spreads, death is imminent." Taiwan's "Independent Evening News" also said in an editorial entitled "On the Current Military and Political Trends of the United States Towards the Taiwan Strait Situation" that "Judging from past experience, the strengthening of US military assistance is often accompanied by its political pressure, which cannot but make people worry." Taiwan's "Credit News" said that the current Taiwan authorities are in a situation of "internal and external troubles, making everyone deeply realize the situation of darkness and endless crowing of chickens. Looking back and looking forward, there is even a sense of grief and indignation." Taiwan's "United Daily News" believes that the United States is already preparing to treat the Taiwan authorities "as a sacrifice," therefore, the Taiwan authorities "must regard themselves as a hub and prepare for early response."

### 感慨美国不可靠  台湾多怨声  担心终被抛弃  主张早作准备

    感慨美国不可靠
    台湾多怨声
    担心终被抛弃
    主张早作准备
    新华社16日讯　据报道，台湾当局最近因美国近来的一系列作法而爆发的怨恨的情绪愈来愈深。台湾报纸认为，目前台湾正处在“国际局势诡谲多变，友邦态度暖昧不明”的境地，使台湾军政界中“许多人都因此而对战局前途感觉烦闷”。
    自从杜勒斯9月30日在记者招待会上指责蒋介石在金马驻扎重兵是“愚蠢的”，并且认为蒋介石“反攻大陆无望”以后，台北的报纸毫不隐讳对美国准备有朝一日摈弃蒋介石集团的意图的戒心。许多台湾报纸说，目前的“国际政客们”和“国际姑息主义者”的心中充满了“丑恶、自私、怯懦、残酷”，正在“对自由中国（指蒋介石集团）这么一个忠实的朋友，忍心把它剩下来的有限财资代为作主送礼”。台湾“新生报”隐约地指出，美国对金门、马祖的态度，实际上就是抛弃台湾当局的开始。社论写道，美国“随着情况的不断推移，今天可以认为金、马对于防卫台湾并不重要，明天同样可以认为台湾并不重要。坦白的说一句，在‘战略价值’的借口之下，任何地区均可撤退，均可非军事化。”
    许多台湾报纸认为目前“台湾局势，波诡云谲，阴霾满天”，美国实在靠不住。台湾“联合报”在10月4日发表题为“以沉静态度看美国的政策”的社论说，“面对目前这一局势，我们若以美国当局的一言一行而感沮丧，如对杜勒斯谈话的反应，是一种错误；同样若以美国当局的一言一行而感狂欢，如对上次艾森豪威尔演讲的反应，也是一种错误。”社论对台湾当局“何以对美国真正态度发觉得如此的迟缓”一事发出感慨，它认为“9月25日杜勒斯在纽约所发表的那篇演讲，只差一点没有把金门中立化这几个字说出来。尤其不应该完全被艾森豪威尔总统的不姑息的演讲所麻醉，而忘记了藏在它底下的准备姑息的那个阴暗角落。”社论说，台湾当局“对于美国政策的了解，常习惯于一厢情愿的解释，对有利部分经常作过分的夸大，对不利部分则经常予以忽视，直至使人怀疑我们究竟是否具备一种分析和透彻了解美国外交文件的起码能力。”台北市盛传：国民党某元老听到美国海军陆战队等地面部队以参加演习为名，开到台湾赖着不走以后，曾往见蒋介石，赠以“坐视燎原，死亡无日”八个字。台湾“自立晚报”在一篇题为“论当前美国对台海局势的军政动态”的社论中也说，“证诸以往经验，美国军事上援助的加强，往往随其政治上的压力以俱来，令人不能免于杞忧。”台湾“征信新闻”说，目前台湾当局处在“内忧外患，使每一个人都深深体会到风雨如晦，鸡鸣不已的处境。顾后瞻前，尤有悲愤的气概。”台湾“联合报”认为，美国已经准备把台湾当局“当作祭品”，因此，台湾当局“须自居枢纽，早作应付的准备”。
