Xinhua News Agency, October 27th:

Beijing Normal University's Department of Education, comprising 140 students and 43 teachers, departed for Zhoukoudian District, Beijing on October 16th to establish an education experimental zone. This zone will serve as a primary site for teachers and students to participate in labor and practical work, summarize and promote advanced experiences in education, and conduct experiments and theoretical research in communist education. The tasks within the experimental zone will be primarily undertaken by third-year students and teachers from the department, rotating annually. They will be engaged in both teaching and school management, combining study and labor, learning theory and summarizing practical experience, as well as studying, working, and participating in political and production struggles. Their initial efforts will focus on assisting the area in establishing numerous nurseries and kindergartens, and helping existing primary and secondary schools to establish factories and farms, institutionalizing student participation in labor. On the basis of eliminating illiteracy, they will universally establish agricultural middle schools, spare-time schools, Red and Expert schools, part-work part-study schools, and worker-peasant universities. They will also develop normal school education and conduct socialist and communist ideological education movements. They plan to establish an educational network in the area within one year, and prioritize popularizing primary, secondary, and university education among adults in key areas such as the Fangshan People's Commune, Changgou People's Commune, and Hebei People's Commune. Within a few years, they aim to establish a complete communist education system in the area, popularize higher education, and realize the great goal of "everyone producing, everyone learning," and "intellectualizing workers and peasants, and having intellectuals engage in labor."

On the basis of establishing many schools, they will also carry out mass communist education scientific theory research work. Every student and teacher who goes down to the area must engage in scientific research, write articles, and organize local educators to participate in research. They will launch a comprehensive publication, "Educational Practice," to summarize and exchange practical educational experiences and conduct educational scientific theory research.

All the work in the education experimental zone will be carried out under the unified plan and leadership of the local District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Commune Party Committee. The specific leadership work will be jointly organized by the Party General Branch of the Department of Education of Beijing Normal University, the Zhoukoudian District cultural and educational responsible cadres, and local teachers to form an "Educational Science Research Institute."

In the education experimental zone, students will adopt a method of regular big contending, big blooming, and big debating for their learning activities. They will have two centralized learning sessions each week, with the remaining time dedicated to self-study and decentralized group discussions. Some courses will be taught on-site. For some course content, a "those who are capable should be the teachers" approach will be adopted, with students who have achieved success in their work in the experimental zone giving lectures. Each teacher and student will also be issued a "Labor Handbook" to record the time and achievements of each person's participation in productive labor, with each person participating in productive labor for more than eight hours per week.

    既教学又办学　既学习又劳动
    北京师大在周口店建立教育实验区
    新华社27日讯　北京师范大学教育系一百四十名学生和四十三名教师10月16日出发到北京市周口店区，开始在那里建立教育实验区，作为师生们参加劳动和实际工作锻炼、总结推广教育工作先进经验、进行共产主义教育的实验和理论研究的主要场所。实验区工作任务，主要由这个系的三年级学生和教师来担任，每年轮换一次。他们在那里既教学又办学，既学习又劳动，既学习理论又总结实际经验，既学习、工作又参加政治斗争和生产斗争。他们首先将帮助这个地区大办托儿所、幼儿园；帮助现有中小学大办工厂、农场，使这些学校的学生参加劳动形成制度化；在帮助扫除文盲的基础上，普遍建立农业中学、业余学校、红专学校、半工半读学校和工农大学等；发展师范教育；开展社会主义和共产主义思想教育运动。他们计划一年内在这个地区建立起教育网，并在房山人民公社、长沟人民公社和河北人民公社等几个重点首先在成年人中普及小学、中学和大学教育；几年内力争在这个地区建立起完整的共产主义教育体制，普及高等教育，实现“人人都生产，人人都学习”，“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”的伟大目标。
    在大办学校的基础上，他们还要开展群众性的共产主义教育科学理论研究工作。下去的学生和教师人人都要搞科学研究，个个都要写文章，还要组织本地的教育工作者参加研究工作。他们将创办一个总结交流教育实际经验、进行教育科学理论研究的综合性刊物——“教育实践”。
    教育实验区全部工作都在当地中共区委和人民公社党委的统一计划统一领导下进行。具体领导工作由北京师大教育系党总支、周口店区文教负责干部、当地的教师共同组织一个“教育科学研究所”负责。
    学生们在教育实验区，将采取定期大鸣大放大辩论的方式进行学习活动，每周集中学习两次，其他时间是自学和分散进行小组讨论。有的课将进行现场教学。有的课程内容将采取“能者为师”的办法，由在实验区工作有成绩的学生来讲授。师生们每人还发有“劳动手册”一本，记录每人参加生产劳动的时间和成绩，每人每周有八小时以上时间参加生产劳动。
