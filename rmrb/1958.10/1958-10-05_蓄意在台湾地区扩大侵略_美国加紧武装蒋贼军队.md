Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. U.S. imperialism is stepping up the expansion of the armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandits in order to drive them to carry out new military provocations and acts of harassment. According to foreign news agencies, Washington official sources say that the amount of military supplies the United States will ship to the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan this year will exceed 200 million U.S. dollars, more than double last year's amount. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Defense admitted on the 2nd that it is handing over a batch of B-57 jet bombers to the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force in Taiwan. A batch of U.S. C-119 "Flying Boxcar" transport aircraft flew from Okinawa to Tainan and were handed over to the Chiang Kai-shek group so that the Chiang bandits could use these transport aircraft to reinforce Jinmen. The United States recently handed over a batch of light landing craft to the Chiang Kai-shek group.

It is worth noting that while war maniacs in the United States are stepping up preparations for nuclear war in Taiwan, they are also supplying certain types of missiles and rocket weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The United States has handed over "Sidewinder" missiles to the Chiang bandit air force, driving them to commit heinous crimes. Foreign reporters stationed in Taipei reported that the U.S. military has set up a series of self-guided surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles in Taiwan. These missiles have been or are being installed along the coast of Taiwan, facing the Chinese mainland.

U.S. military generals are also constantly going to Taiwan to plot aggressive conspiracies. The new commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Kiewitt, the commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, Pate, the commander of the U.S. forces in Taiwan, Smoot, and others, held talks with the Chiang bandits on the 2nd to discuss the issue of "further strengthening U.S.-Chiang military cooperation." On September 30, the first day of Pate's activities in Taiwan, news came from Taipei that the U.S. Marine Corps had transported a batch of eight-inch howitzers from Okinawa to Jinmen Island by tank landing craft.

The Associated Press quoted a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman as saying, "Everyone knows that everything the Nationalists use—down to the last drop of gasoline—has always been supplied by the United States." This once again shows that every military provocation and atrocity committed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army is inseparable from U.S. supplies and instructions. The Chinese people express great indignation at the U.S. imperialist crime of intensifying the arming of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous army and interfering in China's internal affairs.

### 蓄意在台湾地区扩大侵略  美国加紧武装蒋贼军队

    蓄意在台湾地区扩大侵略
    美国加紧武装蒋贼军队
    新华社3日讯　美帝国主义正在加紧扩大武装蒋介石卖国贼的军队，以便驱策他们进行新的军事挑衅和骚扰罪行。据外国通讯社报道，华盛顿官方消息说，今年美国运给台湾蒋介石集团的军火将超过二亿美元，比去年增加一倍多。同时，美国国防部在2日承认了正在把一批B—57型喷气轰炸机交给台湾蒋介石空军。美国的一批C—119型“飞行车厢式”运输机从冲绳岛飞到台南，交给蒋介石集团，以便蒋贼利用这种运输机向金门增援。美国最近还把一批轻型登陆艇交给蒋介石集团。
    值得注意的是，美国战争狂人在台湾加紧准备核战争的同时，还把某些类型的导弹和火箭武器供给蒋介石军队。美国已把“响尾蛇”导弹交给蒋贼空军，驱使他们犯下了滔天的罪行。驻台北的外国记者报道说，美军在台湾设置了一系列自导装置的地对空导弹和地对地导弹。这些导弹已经或正在装置中，位置在台湾沿岸，面对着我国大陆。
    美军将领也不断到台湾策划侵略阴谋。美国第七舰队新任司令基维特、美国海军陆战队司令培特、侵台美军司令斯摩特等，2日同蒋贼举行了会谈，讨论“进一步加强美蒋军事合作”的问题。9月30日培特到台湾活动的第一天，台北传出消息说，美国海军陆战队已经把一批八英寸口径榴弹炮用坦克登陆艇从冲绳岛运去金门岛。
    美联社报道美国国防部发言人的谈话说，“大家都知道，国民党人所用的一切东西——一直到最后一滴汽油——都一直是由美国供给的。”这又一次说明了蒋介石卖国军队每一次战争挑衅和暴行，都是和美国的供应和指使分不开的。中国人民对美帝国主义加紧武装蒋介石卖国军队干涉中国内政的罪恶行为，表示极大的愤慨。
