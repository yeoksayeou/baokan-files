	Borderland Songs and Paintings

	Harvest follows harvest, potatoes are stronger than last year,
		Small potatoes weigh five ounces, big ones fill a basket.				Li Ming poem, Chen Qi painting

	A single ear of grain has a thousand kernels, a stalk of grain is five feet tall,
		A single broad bean weighs one ounce, a single pumpkin takes two to carry.				Xu Zhang painting

	Who says there are no roads in the sky? Terraces extend to the white clouds,
		Sowing seeds while riding the clouds and mist, celebrating the harvest on both banks of the Milky Way.				Yi Feng painting

    边疆歌画
    丰收一场接一场，洋芋要比去年强，
    小的洋芋有五两，大的一个装一筐。				黎明诗陈琦画
    一穗谷子有千粒，一根谷秆五尺高，
    一颗蚕豆一两重，一个南瓜两人挑。　				许章衡画
    谁说天上没有路，梯田修到白云头，
    翻云驾雾播下种，银河两岸庆丰收。				一　峰画
