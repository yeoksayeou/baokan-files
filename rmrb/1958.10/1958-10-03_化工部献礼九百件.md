The entire staff of the Ministry of Chemical Industry presented 925 creative inventions and technical innovation projects as a gift to the National Day. The Chemical Engineering Design Institute adopted a method of producing metallic sodium by electrolyzing molten salt, reducing the cost by four-fifths compared to the past. The Chemical Research Institute successfully trial-produced high-strength electrical insulating varnish using organic silicon, and its wear resistance greatly exceeded that of American products. The Chemical Engineering Design Institute's "native method" rectifier, which does not use machinery or mercury, has opened up the road for the caustic soda industry to flourish everywhere in rural areas. The high-speed Banbury mixer successfully trial-produced by the Rubber Design Institute is a major piece of equipment in the rubber industry. It doubles the roller speed of the old Banbury mixer, increases the pressure inside the mixing chamber by four times, and shortens the production cycle by more than two-thirds. Due to the greatly reduced base, one unit can save more than five tons of metal.

    化工部献礼九百件
    本报讯　化学工业部全体工作人员以创造发明和技术革新项目九百二十五件，作为向国庆的献礼。化工设计院采用电解熔融食盐方法制金属钠，成本比过去便宜五分之四。化工研究院用有机硅做高强度的电绝缘漆试制成功，耐磨次数大大超过美国产品。化工设计院不用机械和水银的“土法”整流器，为烧碱工业在农村遍地开花开辟了道路。橡胶设计院试制成功的快速密炼机是橡胶工业中的主要设备，它比旧式密炼机滚筒速度提高一倍，混合室内的压力提高了四倍，生产周期缩短三分之二以上，由于底座大为减小，一台可节省金属五吨以上。
