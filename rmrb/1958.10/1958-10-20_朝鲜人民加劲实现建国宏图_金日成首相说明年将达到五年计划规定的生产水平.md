Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th -- According to the Korean Central News Agency, Premier Kim Il-sung of the Korean Cabinet said during his visit to the Taean Electrical Appliance Factory in South Pyongan Province on the 16th that Korea will reach the production level stipulated at the end of the Five-Year Plan next year.

Korea's first Five-Year Plan began in 1957 and was originally scheduled to be completed in 1961.

Premier Kim Il-sung pointed out that we should carry out construction faster. He said that the goals he put forward in his report celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic are not dreams. These goals are, in the near future, for Korea to produce 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 25 million tons of coal, 3 million to 3.5 million tons of steel, 500 million meters of cloth, 5 million tons of cement, 4 million tons of pig iron and granulated iron, 1.5 million to 2 million tons of chemical fertilizer, 1 million tons of fish, 100,000 tons of sugar, and more than 7 million tons of grain. He pointed out that when these grand goals were submitted to the working people for discussion, they were determined to achieve these goals in four or five years, rather than in six or seven years.

He said: Now, all our people are eager to ride the Chollima (Thousand-li Horse). We can do anything.

The workers at the electrical appliance factory inspected by Kim Il-sung are carrying out an innovation movement, preparing to increase the output of various types of motors and electrical equipment to nearly four times this year's target next year by increasing labor productivity.

Premier Kim Il-sung praised the workers' efforts. He said that the mechanization and automation of work procedures, as well as further improvements in technical level and skill, are the main means to improve labor productivity. Kim Il-sung said that for this reason, it is necessary to break mysticism and overcome conservative thinking.

Premier Kim Il-sung emphasized that in the future, electricity should be produced by utilizing everything available - water, thermal gas, and wind. He instructed the workers to produce a large number of generators, transformers, and various motors for this purpose, and to reduce production costs. Premier Kim Il-sung called for a nationwide movement to increase electricity production and conserve electricity. He said that today, one of the most important issues in our country is the rapid development of the electricity industry. In the next six or seven years, we must produce at least 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. To this end, we must build larger hydropower stations and thermal power stations. However, doing just that is not enough. We must build small power stations everywhere, even in rural areas and remote mountainous areas. Let us launch a nationwide movement to build power stations.

    朝鲜人民加劲实现建国宏图
    金日成首相说明年将达到五年计划规定的生产水平
    新华社平壤19日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社消息：朝鲜内阁首相金日成16日在视察平安南道大安电器厂时说，朝鲜将在明年达到规定在五年计划结束时达到的生产水平。
    朝鲜的第一个五年计划是从1957年开始执行的，原定在1961年完成。
    金日成首相指出，我们应当更快地进行建设。他说，他在庆祝共和国建国十周年所作的报告中提出的目标不是梦想。这些目标就是在最近的将来，朝鲜生产电力二百亿度、煤炭二千五百万吨、钢三百万到三百五十万吨、布匹五亿公尺、水泥五百万吨、生铁和粒铁四百万吨、化学肥料一百五十万到二百万吨、鱼类一百万吨、糖十万吨和粮食七百万吨以上。他指出，当这些宏伟的目标提交劳动人民讨论的时候，他们决心在四年或五年内实现这些目标，而不是在六年或七年内实现这些目标。
    他说：现在，我们全体人民都切望跨上千里马。我们能够做任何事情。
    金日成所视察的这家电器厂的工人们正在开展革新运动，通过提高劳动生产率，准备在明年把各种类型的电机和电气器材的产量提高到今年指标的将近四倍。
    金日成首相称赞了工人们的努力。他说，工作程序的机械化和自动化，以及进一步提高技术水平和熟练程度，是提高劳动生产率的主要手段。金日成说，为此，必须打破神秘主义和克服保守思想。
    金日成首相强调将来要通过利用一切可得到的东西——水、热力煤气和风——生产出电来。他指示工人们为了这个目的要生产大量发电机、变压器和各式电机，并且要降低生产成本。金日成首相号召展开全国性的电力增产节约运动。他说，今天，我国最重要的问题之一是迅速发展电力工业。今后六、七年当中，我们至少要生产二百亿度电。为了这个目的，我们必须修建更大型的水电站和热电站。然而，光这样做是不够的。我们必须到处修建小型发电站，甚至在乡间和偏僻的山区。让我们展开一个修建电站的全国性运动。
