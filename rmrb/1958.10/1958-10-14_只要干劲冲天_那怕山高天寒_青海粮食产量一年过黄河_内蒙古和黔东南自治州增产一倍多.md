    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 12th - According to the actual output that has been threshed and the estimated output of the unthreshed portions, the average yield per mu of grain crops in Qinghai Province this year can reach 470 jin, with a total output of over 3 billion jin. This means each person in the province will have 1,300 jin of grain. Thus, the province has achieved the single-yield target stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) nine years ahead of schedule.
    Qinghai Province is a high-altitude and cold region, where only one crop can be grown per year. The average altitude of the agricultural area is 2,200 meters above sea level, while the reclamation area in the Qaidam Basin and grasslands is 2,600 to 3,000 meters. The fact of the bumper harvest shows that everything depends on human effort. As long as enthusiasm is brought into play, bumper harvests can also be achieved in high-altitude and cold mountainous areas.
    There are three characteristics of Qinghai Province's bumper harvest this year. First, the output of barley has risen sharply, with an average yield per mu increasing by 1.31 times compared to last year and a total output increasing by 1.34 times compared to last year, and more than quadrupling compared to 1949. Second, there are both high-yield satellites and large-area high yields. The 1.059 mu experimental field of the Saishike Farm on the eastern edge of the Qaidam Basin yielded 8,585 jin per mu, winning the national wheat high-yield championship. A large number of wheat, highland barley, and broad bean fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu have also emerged, such as De Lingha County, which had more than 14,000 mu of wheat with a yield of 1,200 jin per mu. Third, the bumper harvest was not due to favorable weather conditions, but was achieved by overcoming the spring drought, autumn rain, and frost.
    Farmers of all ethnic groups, in a place where there is no modern agricultural machinery and the natural conditions are not superior, have realized the agricultural program target in one go. This is entirely the result of implementing the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better , cheaper results," and the result of thoroughly breaking down the "theory of conditions" and the "theory of Qinghai's backwardness."
    Party committees at all levels have not only grasped ideological education, but also agricultural production increase measures. At the beginning of spring plowing, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee put forward the production increase measures of "first water, second fertilizer, third technology," and later held on-the-spot meetings on various aspects such as water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, field management, and agricultural tool reform, and organized large-scale collaboration between urban and rural areas, between mountains and rivers, between townships, and between communes, providing a guarantee for the bumper harvest.
    In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, a magnificent deep plowing movement has been launched throughout the province, and the fertilizer accumulated per mu for next year's spring sowing has exceeded 40,000 jin.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 10th - The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain crops, with an estimated total output (excluding soybeans) of 12.8 billion jin, an increase of 1.3 times compared to last year. The increased portion alone is enough for the people of all ethnic groups in the region to eat for a year. Now, the Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, and other ethnic farmers who are celebrating the harvest, in addition to stepping up the digging of potatoes, are carrying out autumn plowing on the newly harvested land, striving for a greater harvest next year.
    Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, thoroughly breaking down right-leaning conservative arguments such as the "theory of nine droughts in ten years," the "theory of extensive planting and thin harvesting," and the "theory of short frost-free period" and "the inability to achieve high yields," and establishing the unprecedented communist style of daring to think and act, is an important reason why farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have achieved a bumper harvest this year. Last winter and this spring, men, women, old, and young of all ethnic groups, braving the freezing cold, worked hard day and night in shifts, and vigorously developed farmland water conservancy. In this tenacious struggle, the region's five plans to expand the irrigated area were all broken through, and the irrigated area was expanded by more than 12.29 million mu. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased by one time compared to last year, and the fertilization area also expanded from 55% of the sown area last year to 80%. Farmers of all ethnic groups adopted production increase measures such as selecting fine varieties, uniform sowing, close planting, and shortening ridges and increasing rows, greatly changing the region's extensive agricultural cultivation habits, and the yield per unit area jumped straight up. The average yield per mu of the region's more than 61.9 million mu of grain crops reached 207 jin, an increase of more than 1.3 times compared to the yield of 89 jin per mu last year. The average yield per mu of corn and rice in the region exceeded 400 jin. Large-area high-yield fields of wheat and millet exceeding 2,000 jin, and "satellite" fields of soybeans, sugar beets, and wheat, have also appeared in various parts of the autonomous region.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 11th - The Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has achieved a large-area bumper harvest of autumn grain crops. As of October 8, the average yield per mu of the 1,297,700 mu of mid-season rice that has been harvested in the prefecture reached 764 jin; the yield per mu of the harvested corn reached 463 jin. It is estimated that the total output of summer and autumn grain crops (including tubers converted into grain) in the prefecture this year can reach 3 billion jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year, with an average of more than 1,500 jin of grain per person. The Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture is a large mountainous area. Before liberation, the production technology of the Miao, Dong, Han, and other ethnic farmers here was quite backward, and they generally practiced extensive planting and thin harvesting. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups carried out land reform, realized agricultural collectivization, and continuously improved cultivation techniques. In particular, last winter and this spring, they launched a high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, expanding the irrigated area by more than 1.1 million mu, basically eliminating the threat of water and drought disasters; the average fertilizer application per mu was more than 20,000 jin, more than quadrupling compared to last year. The Miao farmers in Taijiang County in the Miaoling Mountains improved all of the county's more than 12,000 old-fashioned plows, increasing the plowing depth from four inches in the past to seven to eight inches; and eliminated the "white water fields" where no fertilizer was applied, with an average fertilizer application of more than 200,000 jin per mu. These have ensured the rapid increase in grain crop yields.

    只要干劲冲天　那怕山高天寒
    青海粮食产量一年过黄河
    内蒙古和黔东南自治州增产一倍多
    新华社西宁12日电　青海省根据已经打碾的实产和未打碾部分的估产，今年粮食作物每亩平均产量可以达到四百七十斤，总产量在三十亿斤以上，全省每个人可有粮食一千三百斤。这样，全省就提前九年实现了农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的单产指标。
    青海省是高寒地区，只能种一季作物。农业区拔海高度平均在二千二百公尺，位于柴达木盆地和草原上的农垦区则在二千六百公尺到三千公尺。大丰收的事实说明事在人为，只要发挥干劲，高寒山区同样也能取得丰收。
    青海省今年的丰收有三个特点。首先是大麦产量直线上升，每亩平均产量比去年增加一点三一倍，总产量比去年增加一点三四倍，比1949年则增加四倍多。其次是既有高产卫星，又有大面积丰产。柴达木盆地东沿的赛什克农场一点零五九亩试验田亩产八千五百八十五斤，夺得了全国小麦高产冠军。大面积亩产千斤以上的小麦、青稞、蚕豆也大量涌现，如德令哈县就出现了亩产一千二百斤的小麦一万四千多亩。再次，大丰收并不是由于风调雨顺，而是战胜了春季的干旱、秋季的雨涝和风霜而取得的。
    各族农民在既没有现代化的农业机械、自然条件又并不优越的地方，一鼓作气实现了农业纲要指标，完全是贯彻执行了党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线”的结果，是大破“条件论”和“青海落后论”的结果。
    各级党委不仅抓紧了思想教育，也同样抓紧了农业增产措施。春耕开始时，中共青海省委就提出了“一水二肥三技术”的增产措施，以后又召开了修水利、积肥、田间管理、农具改革等各方面的现场会议，组织了城乡之间、山川之间、乡与乡间、社与社之间的大协作，为大丰收提供了保证。
    为了争取明年更大的丰收，目前，一个波澜壮阔的深翻运动已在全省展开，为明年春播积攒的肥料每亩已超过四万斤。
    新华社呼和浩特10日电　内蒙古自治区粮食作物空前丰收，预计总产量（不包括大豆）可达一百二十八亿斤，比去年增加一点三倍。仅增产部分，即够全区各族人民一年食用。现在，欢庆丰收的蒙古、汉、回、满、达斡尔等族农民，除加紧起挖马铃薯外，正在刚刚收获的土地上大搞秋翻，争取明年更大丰收。
    在各级党委领导下，大破“十年九旱论”、“广种薄收论”和“无霜期短”、“不能高产论”等等右倾保守论调，树立前无古人的敢想敢做的共产主义风格，是内蒙古各族农民今年获得大丰收的重要原因。去冬今春，各族男女老幼在冰天雪地里，不顾寒风刺骨，夜以继日地轮班苦战，大兴农田水利。在这种顽强的搏斗中，全区五次扩大灌溉面积计划均被突破，灌溉面积扩大了一千二百二十九万多亩。平均每亩施肥量比去年增加一倍，施肥面积也由去年占播种面积的55％扩大到80％。各族农民采取选用良种、匀播密植和缩垅增行等增产措施，大大改变了区内农业耕作粗放的习惯，单位面积产量跃然直上。全区六千一百九十多万亩粮食作物，平均亩产量达到二百零七斤，比去年亩产量八十九斤提高了一点三倍以上。全区的玉米和水稻，平均亩产量均超过四百斤。小麦、谷子超过二千斤的大面积丰产田和大豆、甜菜、小麦的“卫星”田，也在自治区各地出现。
    据新华社贵阳11日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州秋季粮食作物获得大面积丰收。截至10月8日止，全州已收获的一百二十九万七千多亩中稻，平均亩产达七百六十四斤；已收获的玉米亩产达四百六十三斤。预计今年全州夏秋两季粮食作物（包括薯类作物折合粮食）总产量可达三十亿斤，比去年增加一倍以上，每人平均粮食在一千五百斤以上。黔东南苗族侗族自治州是一个大山区。这里的苗、侗、汉等族农民解放前生产技术相当落后，普遍是广种薄收。解放后，各族人民在共产党的领导下进行了土地改革，实现了农业合作化，不断地改进耕作技术，特别是去冬今春掀起了兴修水利和积肥高潮，扩大灌溉面积一百一十多万亩，基本消灭了水、旱灾害的威胁；平均每亩施肥二万多斤，比去年增加四倍多。苗岭山区台江县的苗族农民，把全县一万二千多部旧式犁全部进行改良后，翻地深度由过去四寸提高到七寸到八寸；并消灭了不施肥的“白水田”，平均每亩施肥二十多万斤。这些都保证了粮食作物产量迅速提高。
