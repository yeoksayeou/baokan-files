    It is inappropriate to praise the wage system
    On page 3 of the October 11th People's Daily, an article by Comrade Fang Huang praising the wage system implemented by the Henan Satellite People's Commune was published, titled "Wage System, Great Benefits". However, on page 8 of the same day, Comrade Wang Wendao's article "Promoting 'Rural Style' and 'Guerrilla習習氣'" said: "We must thoroughly destroy all bourgeois legal systems, and we can consider abolishing the wage system and restoring the supply system." After reading these two articles, I had an idea: one side advocates the wage system, and the other side says to consider abolishing the wage system, isn't that contradictory?

      Editor's Note: The question raised by Comrade Han Ping is very good. The content of the article "Wage System, Great Benefits" is one-sided, and the title is wrong.

    不该颂扬工资制
    10月11日人民日报第三版上，登了方徨同志写的一篇颂扬河南省卫星人民公社实行工资制的文章，标题是“工资制，好处大”，但在同日第八版上、王文刀同志写的“发扬‘农村作风’和‘游击习气’”的文章里却这样说：“我们要彻底破坏资产阶级的一切法权制度，可以考虑不要工资制，恢复供给制”。我看到这两篇文章后，就有一个想法：一面提倡工资制，一面又说考虑不要工资制，岂不矛盾？

      编者按：韩萍同志提出的问题很好。“工资制，好处大”这篇文章内容有片面性，标题是错误的。
