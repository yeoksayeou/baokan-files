    Wooden Ball Bearings
    Luo Dinghua and three other members of the carpentry group of a farm in Xuwen County, Guangdong Province, considering that general handcarts and ox carts carry no more than one thousand or several hundred catties, and that in the past, durable wood such as lychee and longan were used to make cart axles that were not easily worn out, they spent two days of research and created the first set of wooden ball bearings. At the same time, the Friendship Farm and the County Agricultural Machinery Factory in the county also successfully trial-produced wooden long rollers and round balls.
    The wooden ball bearings made by the employees of these three units have been technically appraised by the County Agricultural Machinery Factory, which believes that when installed on ox carts and handcarts, the general flexibility of rotation is comparable to that of steel ball bearings, and the durability is about half that of steel ball bearings (approximately usable for about half a year). However, the cost of each set of wooden ball bearings is only one-third of that of steel ball bearings, and the manufacturing process is simple, making it more suitable for promotion and manufacturing in rural areas.

    木质滚珠轴承
    广东徐闻县一农场木工组的罗定华等四个人，考虑到一般手推车、牛车载重不过一千几百斤，过去用荔枝、龙眼等坚实木料造车轴，也不容易磨损，于是经过两天的钻研，他们造成第一套木造滚珠轴承。与此同时，这县的友好农场和县农具机械厂也试制成功木质长滚柱和圆滚珠。
    这三个单位职工制成的木造滚珠轴承，已经县农具机械厂作过技术鉴定，认为它装在牛车和手推车上，一般转动的灵活性与钢铁滚珠轴承不相上下，耐用程度约相当于钢铁滚珠轴的一半（约可用半年左右），但是木造滚珠轴承每套成本只及钢铁滚珠轴承的三分之一，而且制造过程简单，更宜于在农村推广制造。
