Xinhua News Agency, London, October 18th. The British Communist Party, in an open letter to all members of the Labour Party, trade unions, and cooperative movement, called on all leftist forces to unite and strive for victory in the next election.

The letter puts forward four points of view, based on socialist principles, against the policies of the Conservative Party. These four points are: using the power of the workers to force the government to stop nuclear weapons tests, hold a summit meeting, agree to ban all nuclear weapons, abolish all American bases in Britain, reach a solution on the Cyprus and Middle East issues, and stop American war plans in the Far East; fully support the workers' demands for higher wages; expand the nationalization of important industrial sectors; and greatly reduce military spending, using the money saved to build houses, schools, and hospitals, and provide more pensions and improve all social services.

The letter condemns the policies adopted by the Labour Party at the Scarborough Annual Conference. It points out that this policy is hindering the working class from taking unified action and encouraging the Conservatives and employers to further attack the working class.

The Communist Party calls on every worker to now launch a struggle against the Conservatives and employers in factories and everywhere. It says: "In the course of the struggle, we can unite people to defeat the Conservatives in the upcoming elections and fight for the formulation of a more militant labor policy." The letter emphasizes that success will be achieved as long as all leftist forces unite in the struggle.

    英共向英国左翼力量发出号召
    团结起来争取大选胜利
    新华社伦敦18日电　英国共产党在给工党、工会和合作运动全体成员的公开信中号召一切左翼力量团结起来，争取在下届选举中获胜。
    这封信提出了以社会主义原则为基础的反对保守党政策的四点意见，这四点意见是：利用工人的力量来迫使政府停止核武器试验、举行最高级会议、同意禁止一切核武器、取消美国在英国的一切基地、达成关于塞浦路斯和中东问题的解决办法和制止美国在远东的战争计划；全面支持工人关于提高工资的要求；扩大重要工业部门的国有化；大大削减军事费用，把节省下来的钱用来建造房屋、学校和医院，发给较多的养老金和改善一切社会服务事业。
    这封信谴责工党在斯卡巴罗年会上通过的政策。它指出，这种政策是阻碍工人阶级采取统一行动和鼓励保守党人和雇主进一步向工人阶级进攻的政策。
    共产党号召每一个工人现在在工厂和各个地方开展反对保守党人和雇主的斗争。它说：“在斗争过程中，我们可以团结人们在即将举行的选举中击败保守党人和为制定更富有战斗性的劳工政策而斗争。”信中强调说，只要一切左翼力量在斗争中团结起来，就会取得成功。
