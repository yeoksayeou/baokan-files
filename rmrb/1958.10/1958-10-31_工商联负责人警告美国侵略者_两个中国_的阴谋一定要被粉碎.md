    Head of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Warns American Aggressors
    The Conspiracy of "Two Chinas" Must Be Smashed
    Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce made the following statement regarding support for Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's second letter to compatriots in Taiwan:
    Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's second letter to compatriots in Taiwan is truly benevolent and deeply concerned for the Taiwan authorities. We firmly believe that the broad patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, as well as all those who are unwilling to be slaves of American imperialism, will be deeply moved, respond to the call, and strive for the sacred cause of the motherland's reunification.
    American imperialism has always attempted to use Taiwan as a springboard to further invade the entire China. Now it is conspiring to create "Two Chinas" in an attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan. Its steps are to first isolate Taiwan, and then put Taiwan under trusteeship, kicking the Taiwan authorities aside. The sinister motives and wolfish nature of American imperialism are already evident. The Huanggutun Incident created by Japanese imperialism in the past is a lesson from the past. If the Taiwan authorities are still obsessed and blindly follow others, losing sovereignty, the result will inevitably be nowhere to stand and being thrown into the sea. The Taiwan authorities should accept Minister Peng Dehuai's advice, turn back from the wrong path, awaken to the truth, and unite with the people of the motherland to jointly resist foreign enemies.
    We want to seriously warn American imperialism that there is only one China in the world, not two Chinas. The conspiracy and tricks of creating "Two Chinas" will certainly be completely smashed. Our liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and the realization of the motherland's reunification, are entirely China's internal affairs. The affairs of the Chinese people can only be resolved by us Chinese ourselves, and American imperialism is absolutely not allowed to interfere. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, our 650 million people are fully capable of smashing any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism.

    工商联负责人警告美国侵略者
    “两个中国”的阴谋一定要被粉碎
    新华社29日讯　中华全国工商业联合会负责人关于拥护我国国防部彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书，发表谈话如下：
    我国国防部彭德怀部长发表的再告台湾同胞书，对于台湾当局，真是仁至义尽，关怀备至。我们深信台、澎、金、马广大爱国的军民同胞以及一切不愿作美帝国主义奴隶的人们，都将深受感动，响应号召，为祖国神圣的统一事业而努力。
    美帝国主义一向企图以台湾为跳板，进而侵略整个中国；现在正在阴谋制造“两个中国”，企图永久侵占台湾。它的步骤就是首先孤立台湾，然后就要托管台湾，把台湾当局一脚踢开。美帝国主义包藏祸心，豺狼成性，已经昭然若揭。过去日本帝国主义所制造的皇姑屯事件，是前车殷鉴。台湾当局如果还是执迷不悟，随人俯仰，丧失主权，结果必然是存身无地，被人丢到大海里去。台湾当局应该接受彭德怀部长的忠告，迷途知返，幡然悔悟，和祖国人民团结一致，共同对外。
    我们要严重警告美帝国主义，世界上只有一个中国，没有两个中国，制造“两个中国”的阴谋伎俩，是一定要受到彻底粉碎的。我国解放台、澎、金、马，实现祖国的统一，完全是我国的内政问题。中国人民的事只能由我们中国人自己解决，决不允许美帝国主义插手。我国六亿五千万人民在中国共产党的领导下，在以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平的国家及人民的支持下，完全有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。
