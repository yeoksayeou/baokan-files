Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The person in charge of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese issued a statement supporting Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots and called on overseas Chinese to promote the fine tradition of patriotism and contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

The person in charge said that the letter to Taiwan compatriots fully expressed the deep concern of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese, for the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. As Minister Peng Dehuai said: "We are all Chinese. Of the thirty-six strategies, reconciliation is the best." We should unite and work together to drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan.

The person in charge said that U.S. imperialism has established military bases all over the world,肆行侵略 (my note: *肆行侵略 this means "wantonly invaded" or "aggressed wildly"* ) many countries, created tension, and brought great threats to world peace. However, in today's situation where the East wind is increasingly prevailing over the West wind, U.S. imperialism has been completely isolated, and following it will only lead to death. We hope that the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, who are already in dire straits, will respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call with practical actions, hold negotiations as soon as possible, and realize the peaceful liberation of Taiwan at an early date. At the same time, we hope that some deceived overseas Chinese will recognize current affairs, promote the fine tradition of overseas Chinese patriotism, and contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    侨联负责人号召国外华侨
    为和平解放台湾出力
    新华社8日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会负责人发表谈话，拥护彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书，并号召国外华侨发扬爱国主义的优良传统，为和平解放台湾作出贡献。
    这位负责人说，告台湾同胞书充分表达了全国人民包括国外华侨对台、澎、金、马军民同胞的深切关怀。正如彭德怀部长说的：“我们都是中国人。三十六计，和为上计。”我们应该团结起来，合力把美帝国主义从台湾赶出去。
    负责人说，美帝国主义在全世界建立军事基地，对许多国家肆行侵略，制造紧张局势，给世界和平带来了很大威胁。但是在今天东风日益压倒西风的形势下，美帝国主义已完全孤立，跟着它走只有死路一条。我们希望已经处在水深火热中的台、澎、金、马军民同胞，以实际行动来响应彭德怀部长的号召，从速举行谈判，早日实现和平解放台湾。同时也希望某些受骗的国外华侨，应该认识时务，发扬华侨爱国主义的优良传统，为和平解放台湾作出贡献。
