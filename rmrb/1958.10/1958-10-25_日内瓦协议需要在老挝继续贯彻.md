    The fourth interim report of the International Commission for Laos, published on September 24, records an important stage in the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos, namely the process of achieving the peaceful unification of Laos.

    Within the year covered by the report, the Royal Lao Government reached an agreement with the Lao Fighting Units, including the organization of a coalition government with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units, recognition of the Lao Patriotic Party, which inherited the Lao Fighting Units, as a legitimate political organization, the establishment of Royal Government joint institutions in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, the incorporation of the Lao Fighting Units into the Royal Army, and participation in public life, followed by supplementary parliamentary elections. The realization of this series of measures has put Laos on the road to peaceful unification.

    The peaceful settlement of the Lao issue is the result of the unremitting efforts of the Lao people. It proves that as long as the Lao parties, in the spirit of patriotism and unity, earnestly implement the Geneva Accords, Laos will be able to achieve peaceful unification. The two sides can even further cooperate to benefit the Lao people. The peaceful unification of Laos is also inseparable from the efforts of the International Commission for Laos. Over the past year, the International Commission for Laos has carried out a great deal of work in supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords by both parties and has made beneficial contributions, thus proving that the supervision and monitoring work of the International Commission for Laos is very important for the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos.

    Of course, the aforementioned achievements in the peaceful unification of Laos do not mean that the Geneva Accords have lost their practical significance for Laos. As everyone knows, the Geneva Accords stipulate that Laos shall not participate in any military blocs, shall not provide foreign countries with military bases, shall not accept foreign military assistance, and the Lao government guarantees that all citizens shall participate in national common life without any discrimination and enjoy various rights and freedoms. These major measures to safeguard peace in Laos and Indochina still need to be further implemented. What is worrying is that while U.S. imperialism is colluding with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and threaten the security of Cambodia, it is also colluding with a part of the reactionary forces in Laos in an attempt to harm the independence of Laos, undermine domestic peace in Laos, and undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. Under such circumstances, the International Commission, which is responsible for supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords, should not only not be abolished, but should continue to play its role in order to ensure peace in the region.

    China is a close neighbor of Laos and one of the participants in the Geneva Conference. The Chinese people are naturally particularly concerned about the independence and peace of Laos not being threatened by foreign countries. The Chinese people firmly demand that the Geneva Accords be thoroughly implemented in Laos without being undermined.

    日内瓦协议需要在老挝继续贯彻
    本报评论员
      9月24日发表的老挝国际委员会第四次临时报告，记述了在老挝实施日内瓦协议的一个重要阶段，即实现老挝和平统一的过程。
    在报告所涉及的一年内，老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队达成了协议，其中包括组织有寮国战斗部队参加的联合政府，承认继承寮国战斗部队的老挝爱国党为合法的政治组织，在桑怒和丰沙里两省建立王国联合政府机构，寮国战斗部队并入王国军队和参加公共生活，随后又举行了议会补充选举。这一系列措施的实现，使老挝走上了和平统一的道路。
    老挝问题能够取得和平解决，是老挝人民坚持不懈地努力的结果。它证明，只要老挝双方本着爱国一家的精神，认真贯彻日内瓦协议，老挝就能够实现和平统一。双方甚至还可以进一步携手合作，为老挝人民造福。老挝能够取得和平统一，也是与老挝国际委员会的努力分不开的。老挝国际委员会一年来，对监督双方履行日内瓦协议曾经进行了不少的工作，并作出了有益的贡献，从而证明，老挝国际委员会的监督和监察工作对日内瓦协议在老挝的实施是十分重要的。
    当然，在老挝和平统一问题上所取得的上述成就并不意味着日内瓦协议已经失去了它对于老挝所具有的现实意义。大家知道，在日内瓦协议上规定了老挝不参加任何军事集团，不为外国提供军事基地，不接受外国军事援助，老挝政府保证全体公民不受任何歧视地参加全国共同生活，享受各种权利自由。这些维护老挝和印度支那和平的重大措施还有待继续贯彻。而人们不安地看到，美帝国主义在勾结吴庭艳集团阻挠越南和平统一、威胁柬埔寨安全的同时，也正勾结老挝国内的一部分反动势力，力图危害老挝的独立，破坏老挝的国内和平，破坏日内瓦协议在老挝的实施。在这种情况下，负责监督日内瓦协议的实施的国际委员会自然不仅不应该取消，而且应该继续发挥它的作用，以保障这一地区的和平。
    中国是老挝的紧密邻邦，又是日内瓦会议的参加国之一，中国人民对老挝的独立和平不受外来威胁当然感到特别关切。中国人民坚决要求日内瓦协议在老挝得到彻底实施，而不遭受破坏。
