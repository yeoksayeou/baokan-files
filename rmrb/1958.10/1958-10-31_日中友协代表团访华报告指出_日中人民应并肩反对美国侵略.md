Matsumoto Jiichiro and the delegates unanimously praised the important significance of the current Great Leap Forward in China.

The deputy head of the delegation, Hirano Yoshitaro, and delegate Kawakami Kankichi both said that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the Japan-Chiang "Treaty" are concrete manifestations of the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile policy towards China, and that Japan-China relations cannot be normalized without the revocation of these two treaties. They emphasized that the Japanese people should launch a joint struggle with the Chinese people to crush the aggression of the common enemy, American imperialism. They expressed their firm belief in the final victory of this joint struggle.

The meeting discussed the issue of investigating the remains of Chinese martyrs who were forcibly brought to Japan by Japanese militarists during the war and sacrificed their lives.
