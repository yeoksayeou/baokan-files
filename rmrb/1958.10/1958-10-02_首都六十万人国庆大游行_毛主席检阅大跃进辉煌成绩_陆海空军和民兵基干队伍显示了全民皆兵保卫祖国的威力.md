Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Beijing held a grand military parade and a celebration rally and parade with 600,000 people today to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

On this national holiday, five-star red flags were hung everywhere in the city. The parade contingents of workers, farmers, students, cadres, and citizens, as well as the PLA review troops, filled the major streets in the eastern half of the city early in the morning. The newly organized militia, each tightly gripping a rifle, ran to the assembly points, waiting for the review.

The eight grandstands in front of Tiananmen Square were filled with spectators. They included foreign guests from more than 70 countries and regions who were invited to visit our country, diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China, experts from the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and other countries who were assisting in our country's construction; model workers in industry and agriculture, responsible persons from central and Beijing-level organizations and groups, representatives from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic minorities. There were more than 10,000 spectators today.

Chairman Mao Zedong, along with his close comrades-in-arms Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, and other Party and state leaders, reviewed the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the mass parade contingents on the Tiananmen gate tower amidst cheers from the crowd.

Bulgarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chervenkov, Albanian First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Baluku, North Korean Deputy Premier of the Cabinet Li Joo-yeon, and Bulgarian Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly Georgiev, who were invited to visit our country, also participated in the review on the Tiananmen gate tower today.

At 10:00 AM, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen announced the start of the capital people's celebration of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, accompanied by General Yang Chengwu, the commander-in-chief of the parade, reviewed the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force by car. Then, he ascended the Tiananmen reviewing stand and addressed the entire Army, Navy, and Air Force (full text to be published separately).

At 10:25 AM, the march-past of the reviewed troops began.

Under the guidance of the national flag and military flag, the powerful representative units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force marched majestically past the reviewing stand, accepting the review of Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders.

Leading the way were the students from military academies. The teams from infantry schools, artillery schools, engineering schools, tank schools, aviation schools, and naval schools followed closely behind, striding into Tiananmen Square with vigorous steps. This is a team of officers and troop backbones who have been tempered by long revolutionary wars under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with rich experience in armed struggle and military-political qualities. Many of them participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and defeated the American imperialists armed to the teeth. Now, they are holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong's military thought, meticulously studying Chairman Mao's military writings, striving to climb the peak of modern military science, and galloping forward on the road of being both red and expert. Under the sacred banner of defending the great motherland, they are ready at any time to give war maniacs a devastating blow.

After the naval troops marched through the square, well-equipped infantry, motorized infantry, and paratrooper units successively passed the reviewing stand in neat formations. Then, towing vehicles towed various large-caliber, long-range artillery pieces, advancing in order. Many giant, fully automated anti-aircraft guns pointed their thick and long barrels straight into the sky. The artillery soldiers operating them were all "all-around gunners."

Endless giant tanks rumbled forward, shaking the earth. At this moment, powerful jet bombers and fighter groups suddenly appeared in the blue sky like lightning.

People continuously cheered and saluted these reviewed troops, who demonstrated a strong revolutionary will, a spirit of courage and progress, and powerful combat effectiveness, and warmly congratulated them on the tremendous leap in their ability to master modern warfare.

Among the defense forces reviewed today were also basic militia teams representing the armed forces of the entire nation. Among them, many were militia heroes from old revolutionary base areas such as Taihang Mountain and Baiyangdian, who defeated the enemy with homemade rifles, homemade cannons, and "iron watermelons" during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War. Today, they were all full of energy, marching in orderly steps, and all equipped with new rifles with bayonets. They are shock brigades in the country's socialist construction and powerful reserve forces and assistants to the People's Liberation Army. Once the motherland needs them, hundreds of millions of militia will immediately go to the front line to put the invaders to death.

When they marched proudly through Tiananmen Square, they immediately attracted people's attention. General Yang Chengwu introduced to Chairman Mao and Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, etc. on the Tiananmen gate tower: They are all militia representatives from every county in Hebei and Shanxi, and the suburbs of Beijing, and they have only been trained for more than twenty days. Chairman Mao and other leading comrades praised them repeatedly.

The militia marched in the square in the same square formation as the regular army. Comrade Chervenkov said to Chairman Mao, "It's amazing that everyone is a soldier!" Chairman Mao said, "This is the great power of the masses!"

People on the reviewing stands kept waving their hats, applauding, and cheering the militia.

The military parade lasted for fifty minutes and then the mass parade of 600,000 people began.

Leading the parade was the Young Pioneers. Among the contingents were steel workers determined to take down 10.7 million tons of steel; also, there were contingents of machine workers, textile workers, farmers from the suburban areas who had already been communized, cadres from various organizations, students from universities and middle schools, members of handicraft cooperatives, industrialists and businessmen, citizens, and religious circles.

The parading people continuously shouted: "Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Support the Arab national independence movement!" "Support the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!" "The US-British aggressor troops get out of Lebanon and Jordan immediately!"

After the contingents of the literary and artistic teams and the sports army passed through Tiananmen Square, the grand parade of 600,000 people was declared over at 2:10 PM. At this time, the crowds in the square surged like a tidal wave towards Tiananmen Square, cheering and paying tribute to Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders. At this time, countless colorful balloons and fireworks flew into the sky, and the entire Tiananmen Square was filled with thunderous cheers. People who have created earth-shattering achievements in the Great Leap Forward are enjoying the joy and glory of the festival to their heart's content. People cheered for this great era where "one day equals twenty years," cheered for our ever-changing motherland, cheered for the organizer of our victory – the great Chinese Communist Party, cheered for our boundless leader, and cheered for our generation of heroic and bold people, forever a source of pride for our descendants for thousands of years.

    首都六十万人国庆大游行
    毛主席检阅大跃进辉煌成绩
    陆海空军和民兵基干队伍显示了全民皆兵保卫祖国的威力
    据新华社1日讯　首都今天举行盛大阅兵和有六十万人参加的庆祝大会和大游行，庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年。
    在这全民的节日里，全城到处都悬挂起五星国旗。工人、农民、学生、干部、市民的游行队伍和中国人民解放军受阅部队，一清早就布满了东半城各条主要街道。刚刚组织起来的民兵们，人人紧握枪杆，跑步奔向集合地点，等待检阅。
    天安门前八个观礼台上站满了观礼的人。他们是应邀来我国访问的七十多个国家和地区的外宾，各国驻华使节和外交官员，正在帮助我国建设的苏联、各人民民主国家和其他国家的专家；工农业劳动模范，中央和北京市级机关团体的负责人，中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、归国华侨和少数民族代表。今天观礼的共有一万多人。
    毛泽东主席同他的亲密战友刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、陈云、邓小平以及党和国家的其他领导人，在万众欢呼声中，在天安门城楼检阅了中国人民解放军和群众游行队伍。
    应邀来我国访问的保加利亚部长会议副主席契尔文科夫，阿尔巴尼亚部长会议第一副主席巴卢库，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相李周渊，保加利亚国民议会主席团副主席格奥尔吉耶夫，今天也在天安门城楼参加检阅。
    十时，北京市市长彭真宣布首都人民庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年大会开始。
    彭德怀元帅在阅兵总指挥杨成武上将陪同下，乘车检阅了中国人民解放军陆海空军各部队。接着，他登上天安门检阅台向全体陆海空军讲话（全文另发）。
    上午十时二十五分，受阅部队的分列式开始。
    强大的中国人民解放军陆海空三军代表部队，在国旗和军旗引导下，威武地走过检阅台前，接受毛主席和党和国家其他领导人的检阅。
    走在最前头的是军事学院的学员们。步兵学校、炮兵学校、工程兵学校、坦克兵学校、航空兵学校和海军学校的队伍紧跟在他们的后面，迈开雄健的步伐进入天安门广场。这是一支在中国共产党的坚强领导下经过长期革命战争锻炼、有着丰富武装斗争经验和军政素养的军官和部队骨干的队伍。其中有不少人参加过抗美援朝战争，打败过武装到牙齿的美帝国主义。现在，他们正在高举毛泽东军事思想的红旗，精益求精地钻研着毛主席的军事著作，努力攀登现代军事科学的高峰，在又红又专的道路上兼程跃进，在保卫伟大祖国的神圣旗帜下，他们随时准备给战争狂人以毁灭性的打击。
    海军部队的水兵队伍通过广场后，装备精良的步兵、摩托步兵和伞兵部队，以严整的阵容相继通过检阅台前。接着，牵引车牵引着各种大口径远射程的大炮，循序前进，许多巨型的完全自动化的高射炮又粗又长的炮身直指天空。操纵它们的炮兵战士，全是“全能炮手”。
    一眼望不到头的巨型坦克滚滚而来，大地为之颤动。这时，强大的喷气式轰炸机和歼击机群闪电般地突然出现在蔚蓝色的天空。
    人们不断向这些表现出坚强革命意志、勇往直前精神和强大战斗威力的受阅部队欢呼致敬，并且热烈祝贺他们驾驭现代战争的作战本领的巨大飞跃。
    在今天接受检阅的国防力量中，还有代表着全国全民武装的基干民兵队伍。其中，不少人是来自太行山、白洋淀等革命老根据地的民兵杀敌英雄，在抗日战争和解放战争中用土枪、土炮、“铁西瓜”打败过敌人。今天，他们人人精神焕发，步伐整齐，全部装备着带有棱角刺刀的新式步枪。他们是国家社会主义建设中的突击队，又是人民解放军强大的后备力量和助手，一旦祖国需要，亿万民兵将立即开赴前线置侵略者于死地。
    当他们雄赳赳地通过天安门广场时，立即吸引住人们的注意。杨成武上将在天安门城楼上向毛主席和刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等同志介绍说：他们都是河北、山西每个县和北京郊区的民兵代表，只训练了二十多天。毛主席和其他领导同志都连声称赞。
    民兵们像正规军一样，以正方的队形在广场上前进。契尔文科夫同志对毛主席说：“全民皆兵真了不起！”毛主席说：“这是群众的伟大力量！”
    观礼台上的人不住地挥动他们的帽子，向民兵们鼓掌、欢呼。
    阅兵历时五十分钟结束，接着开始了六十万人的群众大游行。
    游行队伍的前导是少年先锋队队员，队伍里有坚决要拿下一千零七十万吨钢的钢铁工人；还有机械工人、纺织工人、郊区已经公社化的农民、各机关的干部、大中学校的学生的队伍，还有手工业合作社的社员、工商业者、市民和宗教界的队伍。
    游行的人们不断高呼：“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！”“支持阿拉伯民族独立运动！”“支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动！”“美英侵略军立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去！”
    文艺大队和体育大军的队伍通过了天安门广场后，六十万人的大游行在下午二时十分宣告结束。这时，广场上的人群像海潮一般涌向天安门前，向毛主席以及党和国家其他领导人欢呼致敬。这时，无数的彩色气球、礼花飞上高空，整个天安门广场欢声雷动。在大跃进中创造出惊天动地的成就的人们，尽情地享受着节日的欢乐和光荣。人们欢呼这“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，欢呼我们气象万千的祖国，欢呼我们胜利的组织者——伟大的中国共产党，欢呼我们万寿无疆的领袖，欢呼千秋万世的子孙们永远引为骄傲的我们这一代英雄豪迈的人民。（游行详情见第二版）（附图片）
