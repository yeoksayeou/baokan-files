Dulles' Fifth Trip to Taiwan:一心 want to occupy our territory

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people, went to Taiwan on the 21st to hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, plotting new military and political conspiracies by the United States in the Taiwan Strait region. This is the fifth time Dulles has sneaked to Taiwan to carry out his criminal activities since he became Secretary of State. Although the times are different, the purpose is the same: to interfere in our internal affairs and occupy our territory of Taiwan.

First Time: Plotting the U.S.-Chiang Treaty

Dulles first went to Taiwan on September 9, 1954. At that time, the American aggressor group was further supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to expand its armed interference and war threats against our country. For this reason, all democratic parties and people's organizations in our country issued a joint declaration on August 22, 1954, for the liberation of Taiwan, solemnly declaring to the world that Taiwan is China's territory and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Dulles then rushed to Taiwan on September 9 to plot a conspiracy to invade China. He announced in Taiwan that Truman's order in June 1950 to use the U.S. Seventh Fleet to forcibly occupy Taiwan "remains valid." During this "visit," Dulles plotted to sign a so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in order to continue the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, attempting to "legalize" the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and use Taiwan as a base to expand its aggression against our country and launch new wars. This treaty was signed in Taiwan on December 2 of the same year.

Second Time: Deploying Aggression Plans

On January 18, 1955, our powerful People's Liberation Army victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island. This was originally an internal affair of our country, but the American imperialists clamored loudly, stepped up their military actions, carried out war provocations, and in January 1955, the U.S. Congress passed Eisenhower's proposal, authorizing the U.S. President to "use U.S. armed forces when necessary to ensure the security of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands." On March 3, Dulles went to Taiwan for the second time under the pretext of planning and implementing the so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." He participated in the "ceremony" of exchanging "instruments of ratification" of the U.S.-Chiang "treaty," declaring this "treaty," which the Chinese people had long declared illegal and invalid, to be "in effect." At the same time, he held military meetings with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to deploy plans to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands, and once again issued statements slandering and intimidating the Chinese people, saying: "It cannot be assumed that (America's) defense will be static and limited to Taiwan itself." Shortly after Dulles left, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride announced the establishment of the so-called Taiwan Liaison Center in Taipei (this institution was later merged with other U.S. military institutions in Taiwan), which is now the headquarters of the U.S. military in Taiwan.

Third Time: Strengthening Control Over Taiwan

On March 16, 1956, Dulles went to Taiwan for the third time after attending the Karachi meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council, attempting to further strengthen the U.S. control over Taiwan. He held two secret talks with Chiang Kai-shek. According to reports, the talks focused on the U.S. attitude towards the coastal islands occupied by Chiang's troops. According to a Taiwan newspaper, Dulles "sympathized" with Chiang Kai-shek's view of the coastal islands as "a deterrent factor" to mainland China.

Fourth Time: Cheering Up Chiang Kai-shek

On March 14 of this year, Dulles went to Taiwan for the fourth time. This was after he finished the Manila meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council, rushing to Taiwan to preside over a secret meeting of U.S. diplomatic envoys to various countries in the Far East. This meeting focused on discussing the issue of interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs and the so-called "Taiwan Strait" situation. Dulles held talks with Chiang Kai-shek and issued a statement saying that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is an "important and indispensable part" of the imperialist aggression camp. This once again proved his hideous face of resolutely being an enemy of the Chinese people.

Fifth Time: Plotting New Conspiracies Again

Dulles went to Taiwan for the fifth time on the 21st to hold talks with Chiang Kai-shek. No matter what conspiracies he engages in, the Chinese people's determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan is unshakable, and the American imperialist aggressor troops must get out of the Taiwan region.

### 杜勒斯五到台湾　一心把我领土占

    杜勒斯五到台湾　一心把我领土占
    坚决与中国人民为敌的美国国务卿杜勒斯，21日到台湾和蒋介石卖国集团举行会谈，策划美国在台湾海峡地区新的军事和政治阴谋，这是杜勒斯当国务卿以来窜到台湾去进行的第五次罪恶活动。时间虽然不同，但是目的只有一个，就是干涉我国内政和霸占我国领土台湾。
    第一次：策划美蒋条约
    杜勒斯第一次去台湾是在1954年9月9日。当时，美国侵略集团正在进一步扶植蒋介石集团，企图扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁。为此，我国各民主党派各人民团体曾在1954年8月22日发表了为解放台湾的联合宣言，严正地向全世界宣告：台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。接着杜勒斯就在9月9日匆匆忙忙跑到台湾，策划侵略中国的阴谋。他在台湾宣布，杜鲁门在1950年6月给美国第七舰队武力侵占台湾的命令“仍然有效”。杜勒斯在这次“访问”中为使美国继续侵占台湾曾策划由美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”，企图使美国侵占台湾“合法化”，并以台湾作为基地扩大对我国的侵略和新的战争。这个条约是在同年12月2日在台湾签订的。
    第二次：部署侵略计划
    1955年1月18日，我强大的人民解放军胜利地解放了一江山岛。这本来是我国人民的内政问题，但美国帝国主义者却大喊大叫，加紧其军事行动，进行战争挑衅，并在1955年1月，美国国会又通过了艾森豪威尔的建议，授权美国总统“在必要时使用美国武装部队来保证台湾和澎湖列岛的安全”。3月3日，杜勒斯以策划实施所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”为名，第二次到了台湾。他参加了美蒋“条约”互换“批准书”的“仪式”，把中国人民早已声明为非法和无效的这个“条约”宣布“生效”。他同时和蒋介石集团举行军事会议，部署阻挠我解放台湾和沿海岛屿的计划，并再一次发表了诬蔑和恫吓我国人民的声明，他说：“不能认为（美国的）防御将是静止的并且仅限于台湾本身”。杜勒斯走后不久，美国第七舰队司令普赖德宣布在台北成立所谓台湾联络中心（这个机构后来和美国在台湾的其他军事机构合并），就是现在的侵台美军总部。
    第三次：加强控制台湾
    1956年3月16日，杜勒斯在参加了东南亚条约组织理事会卡拉奇会议后，第三次到了台湾，企图进一步加强美国对台湾的控制。他和蒋介石举行了两次秘密会谈，有消息说，会谈集中讨论了美国对蒋军盘据下的沿海岛屿的态度，据一家台湾报纸说，杜勒斯“同情”蒋介石把沿海岛屿作为对中国大陆的“一种威慑因素的看法”。
    第四次：为蒋介石打气
    今年3月14日，杜勒斯第四次到了台湾，这是他在开完东南亚条约组织理事会马尼拉会议后，赶到台湾去主持美国驻远东各国外交使节的秘密会议的，这次会议着重讨论干涉印度尼西亚内政问题和所谓“台湾海峡”的局势问题。杜勒斯和蒋介石举行了会谈，并曾发表声明，说蒋介石集团是帝国主义侵略阵营中“重要的、不可缺少的部分”。这再一次证明了他坚决与中国人民为敌的狰狞面孔。
    第五次：又要搞新阴谋
    杜勒斯21日第五次到台湾去和蒋介石会谈。不管他搞什么阴谋，中国人民解放自己领土台湾的决心是不可动摇的，美国帝国主义的侵略军队必须从台湾地区滚出去。
