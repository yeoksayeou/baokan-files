Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd – General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, held a grand farewell banquet in Pyongyang tonight to bid farewell to Korean party and government leaders and the people.

Premier Kim Il-sung attended the banquet tonight. Also attending were: Choi Yong-kun, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Kim Il, Hong Myung-hee, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, and Li Joo-yeon; Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jung-ae, Park Kum-chul, and Kim Chang-man; Minister of National Defence General Kim Kwang-hyup; ministers of the Cabinet; heads of departments of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party; senior generals of the People's Army; heads of the Korea-China Friendship Association, democratic political parties, and social organizations; prominent figures from all walks of life; labor heroes; combat heroes; and "Volunteer Army Mothers" Ryu Mae, Ham Jae-bok, support-the-front model Gu Bok-ryeok, Seok Gil-rong, and relatives of martyr Park Jae-geun.

The Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo also attended the banquet. Also participating in the banquet were Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, and embassy staff, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in North Korea. Generals and officer representatives from the Volunteer Army headquarters attended as guests. More than 600 people attended the banquet tonight.

General Yang Yong delivered a speech at the banquet first. On behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, he expressed heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the Korean Workers’ Party, the Republic’s government, Premier Kim Il-sung, and the fraternal Korean people and People’s Army who had given the Volunteer Army warm care over the past eight years. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is about to withdraw completely to the motherland. This solemn action not only once again demonstrates the great efforts of the Chinese and Korean people to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and seek peace in the Far East and the world, but also demonstrates the stronger confidence of the Chinese and Korean people, who are leaping forward along the socialist road, in the power to defend against aggression and safeguard peace. The American imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, have not only not withdrawn from South Korea to this day, but have also further carried out frantic military provocations and threats of war against our people in the Taiwan Strait area. If the American imperialists dare to impose war on our heads, then a more disastrous defeat than that on the Korean battlefield will ruthlessly befall them. (Full text of the speech on page 6)

Chairman Choi Yong-kun expressed gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in his speech at the banquet. He said that the American aggressors have forgotten the lessons of the Korean battlefield and have recently carried out serious war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area. The American imperialists must immediately stop their dangerous game of playing with fire, which is putting a noose around their own necks, and must get out of South Korea and Taiwan. (Full text of the speech on page 6)

Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, said in his speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea Association and the entire Chinese people, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and the entire Korean people, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, for their care and love for the Volunteer Army over the past eight years. He said that although the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has withdrawn from Korea, we will always help each other, jointly resist imperialist aggression, and complete the construction of socialism. The beautiful three thousand li of rivers and mountains of Korea must be unified, and China must also liberate the coastal islands such as Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Matsu.

Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, and Richard Fischer, head of the diplomatic envoys stationed in North Korea and Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to North Korea, also raised their glasses to deliver speeches at the banquet.

    向朝鲜领导人和人民告别
    金日成首相接见志愿军将领并出席宴会
    新华社平壤23日电　中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将，今晚在平壤举行盛大的告别宴会，向朝鲜党政领导人和人民告别。
    金日成首相出席了今晚的宴会。出席宴会的，有最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健，内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金哲、金昌满，民族保卫相金光侠大将和内阁各相，劳动党中央各部部长、人民军高级将领、朝中友好协会、各民主政党、社会团体负责人，各界著名人士，劳动英雄、战斗英雄，以及“志愿军妈妈”柳梅、咸在福、支前模范具福力、石吉荣和朴在根烈士家属等。
    以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团也出席了宴会。参加宴会的还有我国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和使馆人员，各国驻朝使节。志愿军总部的将军们和军官代表出席作陪。出席今晚宴会的共有六百多人。
    杨勇上将首先在宴会上致词。他代表志愿军全体官兵，向八年来给予志愿军亲切关怀的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府、金日成首相和兄弟般的朝鲜人民和人民军，致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。他说，中国人民志愿军即将全部撤回祖国去了。这一庄严的行动，不仅再一次表明了中朝两国人民促进朝鲜和平统一、谋求远东和世界和平的重大努力，而且表明了沿着社会主义大道飞跃前进的中朝两国人民，对防御侵略、捍卫和平的力量，有着更加坚强的自信。侵略成性的美帝国主义，不仅至今没有从南朝鲜撤走，反而又进一步在台湾海峡地区，疯狂地向我国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。如果美帝国主义敢于把战争强加在我们的头上，那么，比在朝鲜战场上更惨重的失败就将无情地降临到它的头上。（讲话全文见第六版）
    崔庸健委员长在宴会上致词时，向中国人民志愿军表示感谢。他说，美国侵略者忘记了朝鲜战场上的教训，最近又在台湾海峡地区进行反对中国人民的严重的战争挑衅。美帝国主义者必须立即停止把绞索套在自己脖子上的危险的玩火行为，必须从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去。（讲话全文见第六版）
    中国人民代表团团长郭沫若在讲话时代表中国人民抗美援朝总会和全体中国人民，向以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民八年来对志愿军的关怀和爱护，表示衷心的感谢。他说，中国人民志愿军虽然撤离了朝鲜，但我们将永远互相援助，共同抗击帝国主义的侵略，并完成社会主义的建设。朝鲜三千里锦秀河山一定要统一，中国也一定要解放台澎金马等沿海岛屿。
