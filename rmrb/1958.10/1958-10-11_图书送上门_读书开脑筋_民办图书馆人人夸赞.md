Books Delivered to Your Doorstep, Reading Opens Minds
Publicly Run Libraries are Praised by All

(Reported by our newspaper) A large number of publicly run libraries have been established throughout the country. Up to now, in the fifteen provinces and cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hebei, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou alone, 3,847 publicly run libraries have been established. Among them, Hunan Province has already created 1,805 publicly run libraries.

Various localities have adopted the method of mobilizing the whole Party and all the people, following the mass line to vigorously develop libraries. Relying on the masses, Xishui County, Hubei Province, used the method of carrying out activities while establishing organizations and consolidating improvements. In just fifteen days, they established fifty-four publicly run libraries in sixty-eight townships. After removing the label of illiteracy in June of this year, the residents of Hongshun Lane in Hebei District, Tianjin, showed even greater enthusiasm for learning culture. They established a publicly run library in four days. Now, this library already has more than 1,500 books; these books were all donated by organizations, schools, and residents. The masses in various localities also help publicly run libraries with management and reading guidance. Some people, fearing the loss of books from the publicly run libraries, cut up old cardboard boxes to make library cards and distributed them to borrowers. They also assisted in reminding people to return overdue books.

Publicly run libraries in various localities are generally located in districts, townships, towns, agricultural cooperatives, and urban residential areas, close to the masses and convenient for residents to read. The Yunlu Township Publicly Run Library in Xishui County, Hubei Province, uses "six books" (reading, reciting, telling, studying, speaking about, broadcasting about) and "six reaches" (reaching households, reaching teams, reaching fields, reaching civil schools, reaching meeting places, reaching canteens) and other methods of circulating books to integrate books with production, combine them with central tasks, and penetrate every corner. The publicly run libraries in Hebei District, Tianjin, have adopted methods such as group borrowing and delivering books to the door to facilitate mass reading. Shao Lancun, a resident of Dongxing Lane, said with emotion: "The library is right at my doorstep, and they even take care of my leg problems and bring me books. This is truly a benefit brought about by the new society!"

    图书送上门　读书开脑筋
    民办图书馆人人夸赞
    本报讯　全国各地已办起大批民办图书馆。到目前为止，仅北京、天津、上海、河北、吉林、黑龙江、甘肃、江苏、安徽、浙江、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、贵州十五个省、市，已经建立了民办图书馆三千八百四十七个。其中湖南省已经创建了一千八百零五个民办图书馆。
    各地采取全党全民动手、走群众路线的办法，大办图书馆。湖北浠水县依靠群众，用边开展活动、边建立组织、边巩固提高的办法，仅十五天就在六十八个乡建立了五十四个民办图书馆。天津市河北区鸿顺里的居民在今年6月摘掉文盲帽子以后，学习文化的热情更高了，他们在四天内就建立起一个民办图书馆。现在，这个图书馆已藏书一千五百多册；这些图书都是由机关、学校和居民捐赠的。各地群众还帮助民办图书馆进行管理和辅导阅读。有些群众怕民办图书馆的图书丢失，用旧纸盒剪成借书证分发给借书的人，他们还协助催还过期的图书。
    各地民办图书馆一般都设在区、乡、镇、农业社和城市街道的居民点里，接近群众，便利居民阅读。湖北浠水县云路乡民办图书馆用“六书”（看书，念书，讲书，读书，说书，广播书）、“六到”（到户，到队，到田畈，到民校，到会场，到食堂）等流通图书的方式，使图书结合生产，结合中心工作，深入到各个角落。天津市河北区的民办图书馆采取分组借阅、送书上门的办法，便利群众阅读图书。东兴里的居民邵兰村感动地说：“图书馆就在家门口，还照顾我腿脚不方便，把书给我送来，这真是新社会给带来的好处！”
