According to a report in the Dazhong Daily News: Qixia County, Shandong Province, has adopted a major reform in its farming methods during this year's autumn planting – implementing ridge cultivation. By October 2nd, all of the more than 210,000 mu of wheat fields already sown in the county had been transformed into ridge fields, similar to vegetable gardens, as required.

Qixia is a mountainous county with many thin and shallow soil areas, making it highly susceptible to drought. To overcome the limitations of natural conditions and strive for a per-mu yield of 2,000 jin of wheat next year, the people of Qixia County have decided to transform all 400,000 mu of planned wheat fields into ridge fields. The areas that have already implemented ridge cultivation have not only changed the old appearance of crisscrossing ditches, uneven terrain in the plains, and sloping and uneven terraces in the mountains, but have also basically achieved the water storage requirement of "one mu of land connecting to one mu of sky," creating conditions for developing farmland irrigation and overcoming drought. In the plains areas, the implementation of ridge cultivation has also incorporated the planning of neat roads for field management.

Planning according to local conditions and focusing on ideological work are the main reasons for the rapid progress of ridge cultivation in Qixia County. When implementing ridge cultivation, they conducted comprehensive planning based on local conditions, planning and acting simultaneously. In formulating the plan, they paid attention to changing the original phenomenon of crisscrossing and uneven cultivated land by merging roads, leveling ditches, and filling bends to achieve uniform land plots. The plan was adapted to the requirements of the people's communes for developing production, connecting the land into large areas to fully exploit the potential of the land; and it was integrated with farmland water conservancy construction to lay the foundation for further irrigation development. For example, the Baiyang People's Commune, which has more plains, planned all 51,000 mu of wheat to be planted this autumn into five-mu plots. During land preparation, roads were merged, changed, ditches were leveled, and bends were filled according to the plan, achieving uniformity of the land and wider field roads. Ridge cultivation in mountainous areas mainly uses the original terrain, leveling along the slopes to build small ridge fields. For example, the Sujiadian People's Commune, located in a mountainous area with mostly hilly terraces, adopted the method of raising the ridges along the slopes to form several small ridge fields.

In promoting the ridge cultivation movement, Qixia County encountered considerable ideological obstacles among cadres and the masses, mainly due to concerns about excessive labor requirements affecting timely sowing. In response, the Qixia County Committee of the Communist Party of China raised the questions of "whether ridge cultivation can be achieved and what are the benefits of achieving ridge cultivation," leading the masses to engage in debates while simultaneously taking action. Through the debates, the masses unified their thinking and summarized five major benefits of ridge cultivation: (1) eliminating interspersed land between cultivated areas, making the land large and contiguous, facilitating cultivation and inspection; (2) expanding the cultivated land area; (3) building ridge fields on hilly terraces, greatly improving water storage capacity; (4) facilitating irrigation and convenient management; and (5) implementing north-south planting, ensuring ventilation and sunlight, which is conducive to the growth of crops.

Currently, the ridge cultivation movement in Qixia County is flourishing. The entire county has already plowed more than 240,000 mu of land, and sowing is progressing quickly and well at a rate of more than 20,000 mu per day.

    块块麦地变畦田
    栖霞秋种新法
    据大众日报消息　山东省栖霞县今年秋种中采取了耕作方法上的一项重大改革——实行畦田化。到10月2日，全县已经播种的二十一万多亩麦田，都按照要求整成了和菜园一样的畦田。
    栖霞是一个山区县，山岭薄地多，土层浅，旱灾的威胁最大。为了突破自然条件的限制，争取明年小麦亩产双千斤，栖霞全县人民决定把计划播种的四十万亩麦地都整成畦田。现在已经实现畦田化的地区，不仅改变了过去平原地沟渠纵横交错、地段参差不齐和山地梯田倾斜不平的旧面貌，而且基本上达到了“一亩地接住一亩天”的蓄水要求，为开展农田灌溉，战胜旱灾创造了条件。平原地区在实现畦田化中，还按照规划留出了田间管理的整齐道路。
    因地制宜规划和抓紧思想工作，是栖霞县畦田化进度快的主要原因。在实行畦田化时，他们因地制宜地进行全面规划，边规划边行动。在制定规划中注意改变原有耕地纵横交错参差不齐的现象，通过并道、平沟、填湾，达到地片整齐划一；适应人民公社发展生产的要求，使土地连成大片，充分发挥土地潜力；与农田水利建设相结合，为进一步开展灌溉打下基础。例如白洋人民公社平原地较多，全社今秋共种小麦五万一千亩，全部规划为五亩一片，整地时按规划并道、改道、平沟、填湾，达到了土地整齐化，还有较宽的田间大路。山地畦田化，主要是以原有地形为主，随斜整平，筑成一块块小地畦田。例如苏家店人民公社，地处山区，多是山丘梯田，就采取随坡就势加高地埂的办法，整成了若干小块畦田。
    栖霞县在推广畦田化运动中，在干部和群众中曾经遇到不少的思想障碍，主要是怕用工太多，影响适时播种。根据这种情况，中共栖霞县委提出“能不能实现畦田化和实现畦田化有那些好处”的问题，领导群众开展了辩论，并且一边辩论，一边行动。通过辩论，群众统一了思想认识，总结出畦田化有五大好处：（一）消除了耕作区与耕作区之间的插花地，使土地大连片，便于耕作，便于检查；（二）扩大了耕地面积；（三）山丘梯田筑成畦田，大大提高了蓄水能力；（四）便于灌溉，管理方便；（五）实行南北种植，通风向阳，有利于农作物的生长。
    现在，栖霞县畦田化运动正在蓬勃开展。全县已经翻地二十四万多亩，播种以每天两万多亩的速度既快且好地前进。
