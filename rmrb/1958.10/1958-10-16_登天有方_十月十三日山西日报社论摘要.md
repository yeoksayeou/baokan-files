A Way to Ascend to Heaven
Excerpts from the Shanxi Daily Editorial, October 13th

    Shilou County is an extremely barren area. But now, this situation is gone forever. People are no longer worried about not having enough food; instead, they are starting to consider what to do with the surplus grain. Why has such a significant change occurred in just one year? What is the fundamental reason? The most fundamental lesson is the change in the centuries-old traditional farming system, transforming from extensive planting and low yields to intensive planting and high yields, from rough cultivation to meticulous farming. People may ask: Why does less planting result in more harvest? This is concentrating superior forces to fight a major battle. We know that among a considerable number of people, there has long been a deeply ingrained idea: it's hard to harvest a hundred *shi* of grain without planting a hundred *mu* of land. In fact, even in the past, planting a hundred *mu* could hardly yield a hundred *shi*! Why is extensive planting associated with low yields? The answer: because extensiveness lacks meticulousness. Why does less planting result in more harvest? It is because of meticulous cultivation. The labor and investment that used to be put into planting ten *mu*, eight *mu*, are now concentrated on five *mu*, four *mu*, three *mu* of land, resulting in a larger harvest. Through this year's experience of bumper harvests, people have begun to recognize this truth. However, from the current perspective, many people are not fully aware of this issue. Our task is to use these undeniable facts to explain this principle clearly to the masses, so that they can more consciously accept this idea. Because, as far as our province is concerned, the land is not planted too little, but too much. In the future, with the further improvement of agricultural science and technology, we will continue to reduce the sown area of grain, just as Chairman Mao instructed us: each person should only cultivate three *mu* of land, one *mu* for planting trees, one *mu* for economic crops, and one *mu* for grain. Less planting, more harvest – this is the path to heaven for low-yield areas.

    Changing from extensive planting and low yields to intensive planting and high yields eloquently illustrates this point: "To achieve something, one must first decide what not to do." We abandoned a portion of the original cultivated land and implemented a system of basic farmland. This is what we chose not to do. This choosing not to do something is to achieve something great. Because our goal in abandoning part of the cultivated land is not to reduce grain production, but to make the grain harvest even greater, and that is precisely the result.

    Of course, the significance of the bumper harvest in Shilou County is not limited to this, or rather, the main significance is not limited to this. It also has extremely important political significance. That is: the fact of the bumper harvest has completely bankrupted all right-leaning conservative arguments such as conditionalism, habitualism, and the theory of regional backwardness. The "wait-and-see faction" and the "settling accounts later faction" have been completely defeated. The reason why the "wait-and-see faction" and the "settling accounts later faction" were hit so hard is because they do not believe in the power of the broad masses, they do not believe that the masses can create history.

    We can say without exaggeration that the bumper harvest in Shilou County is a red flag in the great leap forward of agriculture in our province, and for "low-yield areas," it is even more so a red flag.

    登天有方
    十月十三日山西日报社论摘要
    石楼县是一个十分贫瘠的地区。但如今，这种情况已一去不复返，人们不发愁粮食不够吃，而开始在考虑粮食多了怎么办。为什么在仅仅一年的时间内竟会发生如此重大的变化？其原因何在呢？最根本的一条经验就是改变了人们千百年来所因循守旧的耕作制度，变广种薄收为少种多收，变耕作粗放为精耕细作。人们可能要问：为什么种得少反而收得多了呢？这就是集中优势兵力打大仗。我们知道，在相当多的人当中，长期以来有这样一种根深蒂固的思想：不种百亩地，难打百石粮。其实，在过去就是种百亩，又哪能打得下百石粮！为什么种得广收得薄呢？答曰：因为广没有细。为什么种得少反而收得多呢？就是因为耕作得细了，把种十亩、八亩土地的劳力和投资，集中在五亩、四亩、三亩的土地上了，因而就收得多了。通过今年大丰收的实践，人们已经开始认识到这个真理。但是，从当前来看，不少人在这个问题上还不完全自觉，我们的任务就是要通过这些无可争辩的事实，向群众讲清这个道理，使群众更自觉地接受这种思想。因为就我们省的情况来说，土地还不是种得少，而是种得多，今后随着农业科学技术的进一步提高，我们将要继续缩小粮食播种面积，就如毛主席所指示我们的那样：每人只种三亩地，一亩种树，一亩种经济作物，一亩种粮食。少种多收，这就是低产区的登天之路。
    改广种薄收为少种多收，雄辩的说明了这样一个问题：“要有所不为，而后才能有所为”。我们把原来的耕地放弃了一部分，实行了基本农田制度，这就是有所不为。这种有所不为，又是为了大有所为。因为我们放弃一部分耕田的目的，不是为了少打粮食，而是为了使粮食收得更多、更多，其结果也正是这样。
    当然，石楼县大丰收的意义还不仅仅在这里，或者说主要的意义还不在这里，它在政治上也有极其重要的意义。这就是：大丰收的事实，使一切条件论、习惯论、地区落后论等右倾保守论调都彻底破产了，“观潮派”、“秋后算账派”彻底失败了。“观潮派”、“秋后算账派”之所以碰得头破血流，就是因为他们不相信广大群众的力量，不相信群众能创造历史。
    石楼县的大丰收，我们可以毫不夸张地说，它是我省农业大跃进中的一面红旗，对于“低产区”来说，它更是一面红旗。
