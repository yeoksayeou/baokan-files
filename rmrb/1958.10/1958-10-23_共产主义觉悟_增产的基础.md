    Communist Consciousness—The Foundation of Increased Production
    Worker, Renli Woolen Mill, Tianjin

    The wage system easily leads people's thinking to money. Now that industrial and agricultural production is leaping forward again and again, our material foundation is much better than in the past, and the masses' consciousness has also greatly improved. I think our factory can also abolish the wage system and implement a supply system. This would make everyone's life equal. The wage system is a remnant of bourgeois rights, and we must abandon it step by step as we move towards communism.

    The piece-rate wage system should be abolished even earlier. In the past, some departments in our factory implemented piece-rate wages, and some comrades compared themselves in terms of eating and dressing, putting money first. A few even became corrupt and degenerate. It also harmed production. For example, if other workshops needed people, the piece-rate workshops would not release anyone, and so on. Without piece-rate wages, can production still leap forward? Take the fine spinning workshop in our factory, for example. After rectification, it changed to hourly pay, which not only increased output but also improved quality and raised people's ideological awareness. Our workers and peasants are all fighting hard. They are fighting hard to quickly build socialism and prepare conditions for the transition to communism. What are you fighting hard for? Therefore, I believe that our workers can also establish people's communes as soon as possible, just like the peasants, and gradually transition from the implementation of a semi-supply system to the implementation of a full supply system.

    共产主义觉悟——增产的基础
    天津市仁立毛织厂工人  刘景瑛
    工资制使人的思想容易往钞票上发展。现在工农业生产一跃再跃，我们的物质基础比过去好多了，群众觉悟也大大提高了，我看我们工厂也可以取消工资制，实行供给制。这样可以使得大家生活平等。工资制是资产阶级法权残余，我们要一步一步走向共产主义，一定要抛掉它。
    计件工资制更应该早些取消。我们厂有些部门过去实行计件工资，有些同志就是比吃、比穿，钞票挂帅。个别的甚至腐化堕落。对生产也有损害，如别的车间需要人，计件的车间就调不出人去，如此等等。不实行计件工资，生产是不是也可跃进呢？从我厂精纺车间来说，整风以后改了计时，不仅产量提高了，质量也提高了，人们的思想觉悟也提高了。我们工人农民都在苦战，人家苦战为了迅速建成社会主义，为过渡到共产主义准备条件，你苦战为嘛？因此，我认为我们工人也可以像农民一样，快些成立人民公社，由实行半供给制逐步过渡到实行全面供给。
