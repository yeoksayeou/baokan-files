Taking the Position of an Ordinary Soldier

    The purpose of going down to the company to serve as a soldier is to temper and transform one's own ideology and work style. Therefore, one must be determined to be a primary school student, honestly put down airs, and experience the life of a soldier in practice. We must learn from junior officers and soldiers, and respect the leadership of squad and platoon leaders. Put oneself in the position of an ordinary soldier, eat, live, work, operate, and entertain with the soldiers, and abide by discipline, strictly observe the system, and obey commands like the soldiers. We must participate in all activities of the soldiers without any exceptions. We also have the responsibility to summarize the leap forward experience of this year with the soldiers and company cadres; to examine the correctness of the instructions and orders issued by the leading organs from the perspective of the lower levels, and to understand the sufferings and thoughts of the soldiers. Cadres who go down to the company to serve as soldiers must also actively participate in labor without exception.
                      Lieutenant General Qin Jiwei

For the Sake of Tempering

    Coming to the company to serve as a soldier is because the Party requires every officer to be tempered regularly, not to seek leisure and enjoyment.
                  Lieutenant General Liu Jinxuan

Embodying the Essence of the People's Army

    Cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers is a glorious tradition of our army. Since the founding of our army, we have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's principle of building the army with unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates, and unity between the army and the people. The reason why our army can be victorious in all battles and invincible, the "three major" unities are an important factor. Leading cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers embodies the essence of the People's Army.
                    Deputy Political Commissar of a Certain Garrison Area Jin Rubai

Launching a Great Upsurge in Discussing Glorious Traditions

    Leading cadres going down to the company to serve as soldiers can solve the relationship problems in three aspects: namely, the relationship between leaders and the led, the relationship between individuals and the collective, and the relationship between individuals and the people; thereby establishing a new communist style of "able to go up and down," "able to be an official and a civilian," and "an ordinary soldier."

    Therefore, we must seize this great opportunity to launch a great upsurge in the company to talk about communism and the glorious traditions of the People's Army; through this activity, the understanding of all comrades on the essence of the People's Army and the glorious traditions of our army can be further deepened and improved.
                (Excerpt from the Resolution of the Party Branch of a Certain Artillery Company)

I Will Definitely Improve My Communist Consciousness

    I heard that a general was coming down to the company to serve as a soldier. I thought: he must be wearing a woolen uniform with a general's collar insignia. I didn't expect him to be wearing an old military uniform, a boat-shaped hat, and a private's collar insignia, just like an ordinary soldier!

    The general shook hands with us one by one, and repeatedly said to us: "Don't call me chief anymore! I am the same as everyone else, and you are my teachers!"

    When he shook my hand, I was so moved that I couldn't speak. A general who has participated in the revolution for decades, has gone through the 25,000-mile Long March, and has made many contributions to the people, is now coming to be an ordinary soldier and wants to learn from us. Only the cadres of the People's Army have this selfless work and wholehearted communist spirit for the revolution. I must improve my communist consciousness in the future, work hard, and complete the various tasks assigned by the Party, and be a good soldier of the people.
            Gu Yinsheng, Eighth Company of a Certain Unit

General is a Model

    General - Private,
    What a bright red flag this is;
    Ah! The brilliant Mao Zedong's military thought,
    General, you are a model that inspires us to move forward.
                    Soldiers Wei Dong Guangbin

    论将军当兵
    置身于普通士兵的地位
    下连当兵的目的是锻炼改造自己的思想作风，因此要有决心当小学生，老老实实地放下架子，在实践中体验士兵生活。要向下级干部学习，向战士学习，要尊重班、排长的领导。把自己置于普通士兵的地位，和士兵同吃、同住、同劳动、同操作、同娱乐，和士兵一样遵守纪律、严守制度、听从指挥。士兵的一切活动我们都要参加，不能有任何特殊。我们还有责任和士兵一起，和连队干部一起总结今年的跃进经验；从下级的角度来考察领导机关所发的指示命令的正确程度，了解士兵的疾苦和思想情况。下连当兵的干部，也要毫无例外的积极参加劳动。
                      中将　秦基伟
    为了锻炼
    到连队里来当兵，是党需要每个军官经常得到锻炼，不是来找清闲和享受的。
                  中将　刘金轩
    体现人民军队的本质
    干部下连当兵是我军的光荣传统。我军从建军起，就坚决地贯彻了毛主席提出的官兵一致、上下一致、军民一致的建军原则。我军所以能战无不胜，攻无不克，“三大”一致，是一个重要因素。领导干部下连当兵，就是体现人民军队的本质。
                    某地驻军副政委　金如柏
    掀起一个大谈光荣传统的热潮
    领导干部下连当兵可以解决三个方面的关系问题：即领导与被领导的关系，个人与集体的关系，个人与人民群众的关系；从而树立“能上能下”、“能官能民”、“普通一兵”的新的共产主义风格。
    因此，一定要抓住这个大好时机，在连队里来一个大谈共产主义，大谈人民军队光荣传统的热潮；通过这一活动，使全体同志对人民军队本质，我军光荣传统的了解，能进一步加深和提高。
                （摘自中共某炮兵连支部决议）
    我一定提高共产主义觉悟
    听说将军要下连来当兵。我想：他一定是穿呢子衣服，戴将军领章的。想不到他穿的是旧军服，戴的船形帽，佩带着列兵的领章，完全跟普通战士一样！
    将军同我们一一握手，再三对我们说：“以后千万不要再叫我首长！我和大家一样，而且你们是我的老师！”
    当他和我握手的时候，我感动得说不出话来。一个参加革命几十年的将军，经过了两万五千里长征，对人民有过很多贡献，今天却来当普通一兵，而且还要向我们学习，只有人民军队的干部才有这种忘我工作、全心全意为革命的共产主义精神。我今后一定要提高共产主义觉悟，好好工作，圆满完成党交给的各项任务，当一个人民的好战士。
            某部队八连　顾银盛
    上将是标兵
    上将——列兵，
    这是一面多么鲜艳的红旗；
    啊！光辉的毛泽东的建军思想，
    将军，你是鼓舞我们前进的标兵。
                    战士　维东　广彬
