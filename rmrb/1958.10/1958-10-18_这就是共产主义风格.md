    This is Communist Style
    Kong Sang
    The fact that workers in Xi'an and Dalian consciously rose up to abolish piece-rate wages is a major event worthy of great celebration.
    Thirty-eight years ago, the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, in his article "From the Destruction of the Old System to the Creation of the New," discussed communist labor, saying:
      “Communist labor in the narrowest and strictest sense of the term, is labor performed gratis for the benefit of society, labor performed not as a definite task allotted for so many hours, labor performed not to obtain a definite product, not according to previously established, legal norms, but labor performed voluntarily, irrespective of norms, labor performed without expectation of reward, without the condition that reward is received, labor performed out of habit, out of the desire to work for the common good, and the need (become a habit) to work for the common good as a natural requirement of a healthy organism.”
    Doesn't this initiative of our working class to abolish the piece-rate wage system embody Lenin's idea of communist labor, which is to work for the benefit of society, without regard to quotas, and without regard to remuneration?
    However, there was once such an argument that only the piece-rate wage system can stimulate production, that this is a socialist principle, that it is sacrosanct, and that not doing so is a violation of Marxism-Leninism. These people think they are Marxists, but in reality, they are violating Marxism. Those who think they are defending socialism should clearly see that they have actually fallen into the quagmire of the bourgeoisie in the face of the working class, which is shining brightly with communist ideas.
    At present, our national productive forces are not yet developed enough, and there is still a long way to go to establish the material foundation of communism. However, among our great people, our great working class, communist elements are growing in their ideology and spiritual outlook. With such a people, such a leading class, and with the great construction power stimulated by communist thought, we have reason to believe that in our country, the advent of communist society will not be a distant matter.

    这就是共产主义风格
    孔桑
    西安市和旅大市的职工自觉地起来取消计件工资，是一件值得大书特书的大事情。
    三十八年前，伟大的革命导师列宁在“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”一文中论述共产主义劳动的时候，说过这样的一段话：
      “共产主义劳动，从比较狭窄和比较严格的意义上说，是一种为社会造福的无报酬的劳动，这种劳动不是为了履行一定的义务、不是为了享有取得某种产品的权利、不是按照事先规定的法定定额进行的劳动，而是自愿的劳动，是无定额的劳动，是不指望报酬、没有报酬条件的劳动，是根据为公共利益劳动的习惯、根据必须为公共利益劳动的自觉要求（这已成为习惯）来进行的劳动，这种劳动是健康的身体的自然需要。”
    我国工人阶级这种要求取消计件工资制的创举，不正是体现着列宁讲的为社会造福、不计较定额、不计较报酬的共产主义劳动的思想吗？
    可是，曾经有过这样一种议论，似乎只有计件工资制才能刺激生产，似乎这是社会主义的原则，是神圣不可侵犯的，好像不这样做就是违反了马列主义。这些人自以为是马克思主义，实际上是违反马克思主义。这些自以为在捍卫社会主义的人，在被共产主义思想照耀得光辉四射的工人阶级面前，应当清楚地看到自己实际上已经陷进资产阶级的泥坑里。
    现在我们的国家生产力还不够发达，要建立起共产主义的物质基础来，还有相当长的一段路。但是，我们伟大的人民，伟大的工人阶级，在自己的思想面貌上、精神面貌上，共产主义的因素正在增长。有了这样的人民，这样的领导阶级，有了共产主义思想所激起来的伟大的建设力量，我们有理由相信，在我国，共产主义社会的到来，将不是很遥远的事情。
