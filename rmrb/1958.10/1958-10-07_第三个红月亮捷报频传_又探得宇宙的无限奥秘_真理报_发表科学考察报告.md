Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: According to TASS, Moscow, "Pravda" published on the 5th some summaries of the scientific investigations of the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite.

    The article, in discussing the investigation of the density of the upper atmosphere, stated that at an altitude of 266 kilometers above the ground, the atmospheric density is one ten-billionth of that on the Earth's surface, and for every 100 kilometers increase in altitude, the atmospheric density decreases to one-tenth to one-twelfth of its original density.

    Because the atmospheric density at the aforementioned altitude is only a few billionths of that on the Earth's surface, the resistance there is very small. Therefore, the change in the orbital period of the satellite per revolution is calculated in fractions of a second. For example, in the initial stage of operation, the change in the orbital period of the third satellite was 0.75 seconds per day. A large number of observations can distinguish occasional measurement errors and can very accurately determine the evolution of the satellite's orbit.

    The article then discussed the investigation of the ionic composition of the high-altitude atmosphere. Using the third satellite, new materials were determined for the ionic composition of the atmosphere in the vast area below 950 kilometers in altitude. Experiments have shown that in this region of the ionosphere, the dominant component is the ion of atomic oxygen. In addition, ions of atomic nitrogen were also recorded, but in much smaller quantities. No ions of molecular oxygen and nitrogen were found. At the beginning of the flight, water vapor ions were also recorded, but analysis showed that the appearance of this water was caused by the satellite itself, because it carried a certain amount of water on its surface when passing through the upper atmosphere. However, the ionization of water vapor in the upper atmosphere remains a mystery. Measurements on the satellite showed that the atmosphere with a noticeably perceptible density extends very far into the high altitude, much farther than previously thought.

    Measurements of the satellite's electrostatic charge showed that the satellite carries a negative charge. The intensity of the electric field on the satellite wall is much larger than expected. The intensity of the electric field in the upper atmosphere was measured to be unexpectedly large. Its value is at least ten to one hundred times higher than originally predicted.

    Using the satellite, the first geomagnetic measurement was carried out. The main purpose of this measurement was to investigate the spatial distribution of the Earth's fixed magnetic field at very high altitudes. Analysis of the magnetic maps of the East Siberian geomagnetic anomaly zone showed that the rate at which the geomagnetic anomaly phenomenon gradually disappears with increasing altitude is very slow. This experimental fact is unfavorable to the geophysical hypothesis based on the assumption that the source of this continental geomagnetic anomaly is located in the outer layer of the Earth's crust.

    In the study of meteoritic particles, the piezoelectric sensors with a total area of 840 square centimeters were impacted on average once every 100 seconds or more. This is consistent with the situation where the density of meteoritic matter on a surface of one square meter per second does not exceed one hundred billionth of a gram.

    In the study of cosmic rays, it was determined that there are many fast-moving particles around the Earth that are attracted by the Earth's magnetic field, and these particles surround the Earth like a halo.

    第三个红月亮捷报频传  又探得宇宙的无限奥秘
    “真理报”发表科学考察报告
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”5日发表了苏联第三个人造地球卫星科学考察的某些总结。
    文章在谈到对高层大气密度的考察时说，在离地面二百六十六公里的高空中，大气密度是地球表面的百亿分之一，而高度每增加一百公里，大气密度则再减少为原来密度的十分之一到十二分之一。
    由于上述高度中大气密度是地球表面的数十亿分之一，那么那里的阻力也就很小。因此，卫星每转一圈所发生的运行周期的变化要用几十分之一秒的时间来计算。例如，第三个卫星在运行初期在一昼夜间运行周期的变化是○·七五秒。大量的观测可以辨别出偶然的错误测量，并且可以非常精确地确定卫星轨道的演变情形。
    文章接着谈到了对高空大气离子组成的考察。利用第三个卫星确定了九百五十公里以下的高空广泛区域中大气的离子组成的新材料。实验表明，在电离层的这一区域中，占主要地位的是原子状态的氧的离子。此外，还记录到了原子状态的氮的离子，但是数量却少得多。没有发现分子状态的氧和氮的离子。在飞行开始时还记录到了水蒸气离子，但是，据分析表明，这种水份的出现是卫星本身的存在造成的，因为它在穿过大气高层时表面带了某些数量的水份。但是，水蒸气在大气高层游离这一事实却还是一个谜。卫星上的测量表明，带有可以明显感觉出来的密度的大气，向高空伸展得很远，比早先认为的要远得多。
    卫星静电荷测量表明，卫星带有负电荷。卫星壁上电场的强度比预期的要大得多。测量到的大气高层电场的强度大得出人意料。它的数值至少是原来预料的十倍到一百倍。
    利用卫星第一次实现了地磁测量，这种测量的主要目的是考察很高的高空中地球固定磁场的空间分布情况。对于有关东西伯利亚地磁异常地带的磁力图的分析表明，地磁异常现象随高度增加而逐步消逝的速度是很慢的。这个实验事实不利于根据这一大陆地磁异常现象的来源位于地壳外层的设想所作出的地球物理学假设。
    在研究流星微粒时，总面积八百四十平方公分的压电传感器平均一百秒钟以上的时间受到一次冲击。这一点同每秒钟在一平方公尺表面上流星物质的密度不超过一百亿分之一克的情况是符合的。
    在宇宙线的研究中确定，地球周围有许多被地球磁场所吸引住的快速运动的粒子，这些粒子像一个光环一样围在地球周围。
