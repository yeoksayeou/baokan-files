    Eliminate the Poisonous Effects of Colonialism on Culture and Develop Cultural Exchanges Between East and West
    ——Report at the Asian-African Writers' Conference
    Zhou Yang
    I am very pleased to be able to talk about the topic of "The Culture of the Peoples of Asia and Africa and its Connection with Western Culture" in Tashkent, a city of historical significance. Not far from here is Samarkand, an important post on the ancient Eurasian transportation line. This road ran all the way from Chang'an (now Xi'an) in China to Rome, and many of our Asian and African countries carried out commercial and cultural exchanges through this road very early on. Commercial relations between the East and the West also began on this road in the first and second centuries AD. With the development of commercial relations, cultural exchanges between the East and the West also became active. This economic and cultural relationship lasted for more than ten centuries until it was destroyed by the rise of Western capitalism and its economic and cultural aggression against the East.

    The people of Asia and Africa must defend and develop their
    national culture, and at the same time, conduct
    exchanges with the cultures of other nations.
    Today, writers from our two continents of Asia and Africa are here to discuss the connection between Eastern and Western cultures, which marks a new stage in human history. We are developing friendship and cultural exchanges between the people of the East and between the people of the East and the West on a new basis. The people of Asia and Africa are now awake and standing up, and they are advancing under the banner of peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. We, the people of Asia and Africa, must defend and develop our own national culture, and at the same time, we must conduct exchanges with the cultures of other nations. The liberated Chinese people have become masters of their own country and also masters of all the cultural treasures of their nation. They cherish their own national culture and value the culture created by the people of all countries.
    National culture is the result of a nation's spiritual labor and a common treasure of mankind. It tends to exchange with the cultures of other nations and become further enriched through exchanges. The cultural history of our Eastern nations has eloquently proved this point. As everyone knows, Chinese sculpture art, especially the famous Yungang stone Buddhas and Dunhuang murals, has accepted quite a bit of influence from Indian Gandhara art; the murals in the Ajanta Caves in India also show some of the characteristics of Chinese murals from the Six Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Guo Shoujing of the Yuan Dynasty in China improved the Chinese calendar with reference to the Arabian calendar, and Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty included many ancient Arabian-imported medicines and treatments in his famous book "Compendium of Materia Medica." China's papermaking, printing, compass, and gunpowder were introduced to Arabia, which promoted the development of Arabian culture and production technology.
    The culture created by the people of the East has also promoted the development of Western culture when it came into contact with it. Chinese papermaking, silk, gunpowder, compass, and printing were transmitted to Europe through Arabia, which promoted the great progress of Western culture and science and technology. Arabian mathematics, medicine, and astronomy also played the same role after being introduced to Europe. Indian literature has also had a considerable influence on European literature.
    Many historical facts show that no matter how inconvenient the transportation was at the time, how great the language barrier was, or how different the customs and habits were, the people of Eastern and Western countries made various efforts to promote mutual cultural integration, which did not shrink or stagnate due to natural difficulties.
    The often-quoted words of the British imperialist poet Kipling, "East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet!" only illustrate a historical phenomenon: the people of the East were unwilling to accept the rule and cultural aggression of Western colonialists, and they were full of disgust and hatred for foreign invaders. As for the people of the East and the West, there should not be any estrangement between them. They are willing to get along with each other forever.

    Western imperialists destroyed Eastern
    national culture. American imperialism has intensified
    this trend by sending in a large number of
    pornographic and decadent culture. At the same time, they vigorously
    promoted the feudal dross in Eastern culture.
    Since the Western imperialists came to the East, they have destroyed the economic foundation of Eastern countries and the national culture built on this foundation through their political oppression and economic exploitation. They even further destroyed national languages and prevented their development. They used political power to put national languages in a humiliating position, and deliberately created a privileged class of people who had received their enslaved education, who served them exclusively—we call these people compradors. The imperialists built another culture on the colonial economic foundation—a feudal comprador culture produced by the combination of the local reactionary feudal class and the comprador class. This culture spread a large amount of poison, creating a psychology of flattery and contempt for one's own nation and national cultural traditions among the Eastern people, in order to cater to the imperialists' rule and exploitation of the Eastern people.
    In the past half century, American imperialists have followed in the footsteps of European colonialists and have been doing the same thing, but even more intensely. They have sent in a large number of pornographic and decadent culture full of decadence, eroticism, and barbarism. Through their pornographic films, crime novels, and pictorials, they have been spreading this degenerate culture on a large scale in many parts of the East, consciously poisoning the minds of Eastern people—especially the younger generation.
    While destroying Eastern national culture, they also vigorously promoted the feudal dross in Eastern culture. These two things go hand in hand. The outdated and passive so-called "spiritual civilization" of the East is one of the dross that they vigorously promote, the purpose of which is to paralyze the fighting will of the Eastern people, to make them intoxicated with this empty and passive "spiritual civilization," to be content with the status quo, to not seek progress, and to not resist, which is actually to let themselves be slaughtered at will. This is of course the purpose that the colonialists most hope to achieve. The reactionary feudal comprador ruling class catered to the will of their foreign masters, vigorously advocated this kind of thing, and also spread the influence of this kind of thing among the people. Our great writer Lu Xun severely criticized this so-called "spiritual civilization" in many of his pungent and insightful essays. In his famous book "The True Story of Ah Q," he profoundly exposed and dissected the life philosophy of the passive and unambitious "spiritual victory method" through the vivid character image of Ah Q. Ah Q was a poor peasant who was oppressed and humiliated everywhere. Because he was not highly enlightened, although he had the will to resist, he could not find the correct path of struggle, and he did not have the determination to persist in the struggle. Every time he was beaten, he always found some ridiculous reasons to comfort himself, thinking that this was a son beating his father, a servant beating his elder, a fool beating a wise man, which was not worth bothering about, so he felt that he had "won spiritually." This "spiritual victory method" did not solve the problem at all, nor could it solve the problem. He was finally shot by the reactionary ruling class. Of course, Ah Q is only a negative typical of the working people. The hardworking and brave Chinese people finally got rid of the spiritual shackles imposed on them by imperialism and feudalism in the long struggle, and their successive struggles for freedom and independence won the final victory of world historical significance.
    Lin Yutang, a shameless writer who has long been spurned by the Chinese people, is the one who has been trying his best to promote China's so-called "spiritual civilization." He is a typical product of China's feudal comprador culture and a spokesperson for the feudal comprador class. He focused on extracting certain negative things from Chinese culture and Chinese life, praising and beautifying them. In his writing, the Chinese people became irresponsible, pleasure-seeking, selfish, and individualistic. This is a great distortion and insult to the hardworking and brave Chinese people. There are actually quite a few foreigners who regard him as a Chinese writer. He cannot represent China. He is just a disgrace and a traitor to the Chinese nation.
    Since the May Fourth New Culture Movement in 1919, the Chinese people have been fighting against this feudal comprador culture and have absorbed new ideas of science, democracy, and socialism from foreign countries. Because we know that only in this way can our true national culture be developed. Only by taking out the real national culture can we talk about carrying out exchanges with the cultures of other nations, promoting real understanding between nations, and then promoting world peace and the prosperity of human culture. Only from this perspective can cultural exchanges develop normally.
    Our cultural exchanges with the people of the West, like our cultural exchanges with the people of Eastern countries, also have a good tradition. We cherish this tradition because it has played a good role in promoting understanding between the people of the East and the West. The French philosopher and writer Voltaire once said in his "On Morals": "Princes and merchants go to discover the East only to seek wealth, while philosophers find new moral and material worlds." He also said: "As a philosopher, if you want to know what is happening on earth, you must first turn your eyes to the East—the cradle of all arts, to which everything in the West should be attributed." Therefore, naturally, he used an entire chapter to talk about China at the beginning of "On Morals," and he gave a high evaluation of China's moral outlook.
    Goethe also had a deep feeling for Chinese culture. In his "Poetry and Truth," we can see that he was interested in Chinese art very early on. In his conversations with Eckermann, he mentioned Chinese culture and the Chinese people many times. Regarding the Chinese, he said: "As far as they are concerned, life is clearer, purer, and more moral; they show themselves to be reasonable people and good citizens at all times and places..." In his eyes, the Chinese are a culturally mature and cultivated nation. He has done serious research on Chinese novels, poetry, and dramas. This can be seen in his diary. He also expressed great interest in Indian classical literary and artistic works. Eastern culture broadened his horizons and enabled him to jump out of the narrow geographical circle of Europe and consider issues from the perspective of the entire human culture. In his conversation with Eckermann on January 31, 1827, he said: "I can now see more clearly that poetry is the common property of mankind..., the term 'national literature' is of little significance now, and the era of 'world literature' is coming soon, and each of us should promote its arrival." Of course, he is not negating "national literature" here, but negating the narrow concept of regarding one's own national literature as the only literature in the world. On the contrary, he admired the achievements of other national literatures, and he received new inspiration from the distant Chinese literature. The "world literature" he said should be understood as a collection of excellent products of the literatures of various nations in the world, because they are the "common property of mankind."
    Only on the basis of respecting the cultural achievements of other nations can a nation absorb the advantages of others and enrich its own culture; and normal and effective cultural exchanges between the people of various countries can only be established on this basis. In this regard, outstanding representatives of the cultural circles in the East and the West have set a good example. Despite the various artificial obstacles created by the colonialists, the people and their cultural representatives always try their best to carry out cultural exchanges, which also shows how much cultural exchanges are needed by the people, because this helps to enrich their spiritual life. In modern and contemporary times, many famous translators and writers have translated literary and artistic works from other countries, which has made extremely beneficial contributions to the development of cultural exchanges between the people of various countries, and their efforts are worthy of thanks.
    While opposing imperialist cultural aggression and the domestic feudal comprador culture, the Chinese people also absorb a large number of excellent achievements from foreign cultures—including Western cultures, of course. Lu Xun spent a lot of energy in his writing career translating excellent artistic works from the Soviet Union, old Russia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Japan. Like literature and art, we also absorb the useful parts of Western science and technology and philosophy. Of course, absorption is not equal to imitation or transplantation. We must absorb the useful parts of the cultures of various countries in the world based on our national characteristics and needs as a reference for our independent creation. After liberation, we cleared away the imperialist forces and the remaining poison of the feudal comprador culture on our land, and we are now carrying out the work of cultural exchanges with the people of various countries on a planned and large scale. With a humble attitude, we learn from the advantages of other nations, first of all, we learn from the advanced experience of our great socialist neighbor, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the first socialist country that has abolished exploitation between people to appear on the earth. The magnificent new culture created by the heroic Soviet people has elevated our human civilization to an unprecedented new height.

    Socialist culture and
    reviving national cultures have emerged in the East. These cultures are full of vigor
    and are moving forward at a rapid pace.
    Imperialists are unwilling to have real cultural exchanges between the people. They try their best to isolate the people and create misunderstandings and disputes between the people in order to facilitate their rule and exploitation of colonies and dependent countries. When the colonialists ruled the East, it was impossible for writers from Asia and Africa to sit together to hold such a meeting—in fact, they had never held one. It was even more impossible to talk about the relationship between Eastern and Western cultures, because at that time, only Western colonialists were allowed to impose their colonialist culture on the people of the East. But now the times are different, and the situation has changed. Since we held the first meeting in New Delhi last year, many more nations in the East have gained independence and freedom; and many more nations are fighting vigorously for freedom and independence. Therefore, the number of writers attending the meeting today and the countries they represent has also increased compared to the last time. Socialist culture and reviving national cultures have emerged in our East. These cultures are full of vigor and vitality and are moving forward at a rapid pace. The liberated Chinese people are now building a socialist society with soaring enthusiasm. In their selfless labor, they cannot suppress their love for the motherland and labor. This enthusiasm bursts out and becomes poetry and paintings. Now China's literature and art are undergoing a process of rapid development and bold creation. Comrade Mao Dun has already talked about this in his report, and I don't want to talk more about it. This new situation makes us even more eager to develop cultural ties with the people of various countries on a friendly basis and to conduct real cultural exchanges between the people. These exchanges will undoubtedly greatly promote the development of Eastern and Western national cultures, enrich Eastern and Western national cultures, and promote mutual understanding and friendship between the people of various countries, and will therefore make important contributions to the progress and cultural prosperity of all mankind.
    Finally, I want to say that just as we are discussing the issue of cultural exchange between the East and the West here, the United States is carrying out aggression and war threats in the Taiwan Strait, and the Chinese people are ready to give the invaders a powerful blow at any time. American imperialism has now become the most dangerous enemy of world peace and human progress. Chairman Mao Zedong recently said: Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism, is the task of the people of the world. The Chinese people are making their best efforts to achieve this task. We Chinese writers have always firmly stood with the people at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism. We regard every victory of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for national independence as our own victory. We deeply know that as long as imperialism exists, the world will not be peaceful for a day, national independence and freedom will not be guaranteed, and cultural exchanges between the people of various countries in the world cannot be fully developed.
    Let all writers who love the motherland and love the people unite and fight together against aggression, defend peace, oppose colonialism and all its remnants, build a new culture for their own nation, and develop cultural exchanges between countries!

    肃清殖民主义对文化的毒害影响，发展东西方文化的交流
    ——在亚非作家会议上的报告
    周扬
    我非常高兴能在塔什干这个具有历史意义的城市来谈“亚非各国人民的文化及其与西方文化的联系”这个题目。离这儿不远就是撤玛尔汗，它是古代亚欧交通干线上的一个重要驿镇。这条路一直从中国的长安（现称西安）通到罗马，我们亚非的许多国家很早就通过这条路进行商业和文化上的交往。东方和西方的商业关系也通过这条路在纪元一、二世纪就开始了。随着商业关系的开展，东西两方的文化交流也活跃起来。这种经济文化关系持续了十多个世纪，直到西方的资本主义兴起、开始向东方进行经济和文化的侵略才遭到破坏。
      亚非的人民要保卫和发展自己的民族文化，
  同时也要和其他民族的文化进行交流。
    今天我们亚非两大洲的作家在这里讨论东西方文化的联系这个问题，这标志人类历史进入了一个新的阶段，我们正在新的基础上发展东方各国人民之间以及东方和西方人民之间的友谊和文化交流。亚非的人民现在觉醒了，站起来了，他们正在和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的旗帜下向前迈进。我们亚非的人民要保卫和发展我们自己的民族文化，同时也要和其他民族的文化进行交流。解放了的中国人民已成为自己国家的主人，同时也成了自己民族的一切文化宝藏的主人，他们珍贵自己民族的文化，同时重视各国人民所创造的文化。
    民族文化是一个民族精神劳动的成果，也是人类共同的财富。它趋向于和别的民族文化交流，从交流中得到更进一步的丰富。我们东方各族的文化历史，曾经雄辩地证明了这一点。如大家所知道的中国雕塑艺术，最著名的云冈石佛和敦煌壁画，曾经接受了印度健驼罗美术的不少的影响；印度阿旃陀石窟的壁画，同样也显示出中国六朝到隋唐时期壁画的某些特色。中国元朝的郭守敬参照阿拉伯历法改进了中国历法，明朝李时珍收入不少古代留传下来的阿拉伯输入的药物和治疗法，充实了他的名著“本草纲目”。中国的造纸术、印刷术、指南针和火药，传入阿拉伯后，促进了阿拉伯文化事业和生产技术的发展。
    东方人民所创造的文化，与西方的文化相接触，也同样推动了西方文化的发展。中国的造纸术、丝、火药、罗盘和印刷术通过阿拉伯传到欧洲，促进了西方的文化和科学技术长足的进步。阿拉伯的数学、医学和天文学传到欧洲后也起了同样的作用。印度文学在欧洲文学中也起过不小的影响。
    许多历史事实说明，不管当时的交通如何不便，语言多么隔阂，风俗习惯怎样悬殊，东西方各国人民曾以各种努力促使相互之间在文化上彼此交融，并不因为有自然上的困难而缩小或停滞。
    英帝国主义诗人吉卜林所说的那句经常被人引证的话：“东方是东方，西方是西方，这两个人永远不能遇到一起！”只是说明了一个历史现象：东方的人民不愿意接受西方殖民主义者的统治和文化侵略，他们对外国侵略者充满厌恶和仇恨。至于东方人民和西方人民之间，本来不应有甚么隔阂，他们是愿意永远友好相处的。
      西方的帝国主义者摧毁了东方的
  民族文化。美帝国主义变本加厉，送
  来大批黄色文化。同时，他们又极力
  宣传东方文化中的封建糟粕。
    西方的帝国主义者自从来到东方后，通过他们的政治压迫和经济剥削，摧毁了东方国家的经济基础以及建立在这个基础上的民族文化。他们甚至还进一步摧残了民族语言，阻止它们的发展。他们通过政治力量使民族语言处于一种屈辱的地位，而故意把受过他们的奴化教育的人造成一种特权阶级，专门为他们服务——这种人我们称之为洋奴或买办阶级。帝国主义者在殖民主义的经济基础上建立起另一种文化——当地反动的封建阶级和买办阶级相结合所产生的封建买办文化。这种文化大量地散布毒素，在东方人民中间造成一种媚外的、鄙视自己民族和民族文化传统的自卑心理，以迎合帝国主义者对东方人民的统治和剥削。
    近半个世纪以来，美帝国主义者步着欧洲殖民主义者的后尘，也在干着同样的事情，而且变本加厉。他们送来大批充满颓废、色情和野蛮主义的黄色文化。通过他们的黄色电影、犯罪小说和画报，他们在东方的许多地方大规模地做这种堕落文化的传播工作，有意识地毒害东方人——特别是年轻一代——的心灵。
    在摧残东方民族文化的同时，他们又极力宣传东方文化中的封建糟粕。这两件事是并行不悖的。东方的那种过时的消极的所谓“精神文明”，就是他们大力推广的糟粕之一种，其目的是要麻痹东方人的斗争意志，使他们陶醉在这种空洞的、消极的“精神文明”之中，安于现状，不求进取，不去反抗，实际上是让自己随便任人宰割。这当然是殖民主义者所最希望达到的目的。反动的封建买办统治阶级，奉承他们外国主子的意志，极力提倡这种东西，并在人民中也散布这种东西的影响。我们伟大的作家鲁迅在他的许多辛辣而精辟的杂文中对这种所谓“精神文明”给与了沉痛的抨击。他在他的名著“阿Q正传”中曾经通过阿Q这个生动的人物形象，把那种消极的、没有志气的“精神胜利法”的人生哲学作了深刻的揭露和解剖。阿Q是一个穷苦的农民，他处处受人欺压和凌辱。因为他的觉悟不高，虽然他有反抗的意志，但是他却找不出斗争的正确道路，同时也没有坚持斗争的决心。每次他受人鞭打以后，他总是找出一些可笑的理由来安慰自己，认为这是儿子打父亲，下人打长辈，愚人打智者，不值得计较，于是他便觉得他“在精神上胜利了”。这种“精神胜利法”到底没有解决问题，也不可能解决问题，他最后还是被反动统治阶级枪毙了。当然，阿Q只是劳动人民中的一种消极典型。勤劳勇敢的中国人民在长期斗争中终于摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义所加在他们身上的精神枷锁，他们为自由和独立而进行的前仆后继的斗争获得了最后的具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    早被中国人民所唾弃的无耻文人林语堂，就是竭力鼓吹中国的所谓“精神文明”的。他是中国封建买办文化的典型产物，是封建买办阶级的一个代言人。他集中地把中国文化和中国生活中某些消极的东西提出来，加以赞扬和美化。中国人在他的笔下变成了对社会不负责任、贪图享受、自私自利的个人主义者。对于勤劳勇敢的广大中国人民说来，这是莫大的歪曲和侮辱。外国竟有不少人把他当作中国的一个作家来看待。他是不能代表中国的，他只是中国民族的一个败类，一个叛徒。
    中国人民自从1919年的五四新文化运动以来就一直在和这种封建买办文化作斗争，并且从外国吸收了科学、民主和社会主义的新思潮。因为我们知道，只有这样，我们真正的民族文化才能得到发展。也只有拿出真正的民族文化来才谈得上与别的民族文化进行交流，促进民族间的真正了解，进而促进世界的和平和人类文化的繁荣，也只有从这个角度出发文化交流才能得到正常的发展。
    我国和西方人民的文化交往，正如我们和东方各国人民的文化交往一样，也有很好的传统。我们珍视这种传统，因为它在促进东西方人民间的了解上面，起过很好的作用。法国的哲学家和作家伏尔泰曾经在他的“论道德”中这样说过：“王公们和商人去发现东方只是为了寻找财富，而哲学家却找到了新的道德和物质世界。”他还说：“作为一个哲学家，如果你想知道地球上发生了什么事情，你得先把眼睛掉向东方——那是一切艺术的摇篮，西方的一切都应该归功于它。”因此，很自然地，他在“论道德”中一开头就用整章的篇幅来谈论中国，他对中国的道德观给以很高的评价。
    歌德也同样对于中国的文化有深切的感受。在他的“诗与真实”中我们可以看出他很早就对于中国的艺术品发生兴趣。他在和埃克尔曼的谈话中多次提到过中国的文化和中国人。关于中国人他说：“就他们而言，生活是更明朗、更纯洁、更道德；他们随时随地表现出是一种通情达理的人，良好的公民……”在他的眼中，中国人是一个文化成熟和有修养的民族。他对于中国的小说、诗歌和戏剧曾经作过认真的研究。这在他的日记中可以看得出来。对于印度的古典文艺作品他也表示出很大的兴趣。东方的文化扩大了他的视野，使他能跳出欧洲那个狭小的地理圈子，而从整个人类文化的角度来考虑问题。他在1827年1月31日和埃克尔曼的谈话中说：“我现在看得更清楚，诗是人类共同的财产……，‘民族文学’这个用语现在的意义已经不大了，‘世界文学’的时代快要到来了，我们每个人应该促使它的到来。”当然，他在这里不是否定“民族文学”，而是否定那种把自己的民族文学当做世界上唯一文学的狭隘观念。相反地，他是推崇其他民族文学的成就的，他从遥远的中国文学得到了新的启示。他所说的“世界文学”应该理解为世界各个民族文学优秀产品的集合，因为它们是“人类共同的财产”。
    只有在尊重别的民族文化成就的基础上，一个民族才能吸收他人的优点，丰富自己的文化；而各国人民之间的正常和有效的文化联系也只有在这个基础上才能建立起来。在这方面，东西方杰出的文化界代表人物已经作出很好的榜样。尽管殖民主义者在其中作出种种人为的障碍，但人民和他们文化界的代表总是想尽办法来进行文化上的交往，这也说明文化交往对于人民是多么需要，因为这有助于丰富他们的精神生活。近代和现代各国有许多著名的翻译家和作家互相翻译了别国的文艺作品，这对于发展各国人民间的文化交往，作了极有益的贡献，他们的努力是值得感谢的。
    中国人民一方面反对帝国主义的文化侵略，反对本国封建买办文化，但同时也大量地吸取外国文化——自然也包括西方的文化——中的优秀成果。鲁迅在他的写作事业中花了许多精力翻译苏联、旧俄、东欧、西欧和日本的优秀艺术作品。像文学艺术一样，我们也同样吸收西方的科学技术和哲学的有用部分。当然，吸收并不等于模仿或移植。我们要根据我们民族的特点和需要，吸收世界各国文化中的有用部分，作为我们独立创造的借鉴。解放以后，我们清除了我们国土上的帝国主义势力和封建买办文化的余毒，我们现在正有计划地大规模地进行和各国人民之间的文化交流的工作。我们怀着谦虚的心情，学习其他民族的优点，首先是学习我们伟大的社会主义邻邦苏联的先进经验。苏联是地球上出现的第一个废除了人与人之间的剥削的社会主义国家。豪迈的苏联人民所创造的光辉的新文化把我们人类的文明提升到了一个史无前例的新的高度。
    东方现在出现了社会主义文化和
  复兴的民族文化，这些文化生气勃
  勃，正以一日千里之势向前迈进。
    帝国主义者是不愿意人民之间有真正的文化交往的。他们想尽一切办法来把人民隔离开来，在人民之间制造误解和纠纷，以便于他们对殖民地及附属国的统治和剥削，在殖民主义者统治着东方的时候，亚非两大洲的作家要想坐在一起开这样的会是不可能的——事实上也从来没有开过。谈东西两方文化的交往关系更不可能，因为那时只能准许西方殖民主义者把他们的殖民主义文化强加在东方人民的头上。但是现在时代不同了，情形改变了，自从前年我们在新德里开过第一次会以后，东方又有许多民族获得独立了，自由了；还有许多民族正在轰轰烈烈地为争取自由和独立而斗争着。所以今天我们到会的作家和他们所代表的国家也比上次增多了。在我们东方现在出现了社会主义文化和复兴的民族文化，这些文化生气勃勃，充满了活力，正在以一日千里之势向前迈进。解放了的中国人民现在正在以冲天的干劲建设社会主义社会。在他们忘我的劳动中，他们抑制不住他们对祖国和劳动的热爱。这种热情奔放出来成为诗，成为画。现在我国的文艺正在经历一个飞跃发展和大胆创造的过程。关于这点茅盾同志已经在他的报告中谈到，我不想再多讲。这种新的形势更使我们渴望在友好的基础上发展和各国人民之间的文化联系，进行真正人民之间的文化交流。这种交流无疑地将会大大地推进东西方民族文化的发展，丰富东西方的民族文化，促进各国人民之间的互相了解和友谊，因而对整个人类进步和文化繁荣也将会作出重要的贡献。
    最后我要说一说，正当我们在这儿讨论东西文化交流的问题的时候，美国却正在台湾海峡进行侵略和战争威胁，中国人民随时准备给侵略者以有力的打击。美帝国主义现在已经成为世界和平和人类进步的最危险的敌人。毛泽东主席在最近说：结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。中国人正为实现这个任务而作最大的努力。我们中国作家始终坚定不移地和人民一道，站在反对帝国主义斗争的最前线，我们把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民为争取民族独立而斗争的每一胜利都看成是自己的胜利一样。我们深知，帝国主义存在一天，世界就一天不得安宁，民族独立和自由就没有保障，世界各国人民之间的文化交流就不可能充分发展。
    一切爱祖国爱人民的作家团结起来，为反对侵略、保卫和平，为反对殖民主义及其一切残余，为建立自己民族的新文化和发展各国文化交流而共同奋斗吧！
