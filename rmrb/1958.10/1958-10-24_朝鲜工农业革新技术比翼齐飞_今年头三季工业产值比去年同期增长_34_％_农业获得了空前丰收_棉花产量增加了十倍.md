Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 22nd - The Korean Central News Agency published today a report summarizing the implementation of the people's economic plan in North Korea for the third quarter of this year. The report said that in the first nine months of this year, North Korea overfulfilled the total industrial output value plan by 10%, an increase of 34% compared with the same period last year.

The report said that in the third quarter of this year, due to the bold adoption of new technologies, the breaking of old technical indicators, and the upsurge of a great production innovation movement in various industrial sectors, workers at the Hwanghae Iron Works used iron coke to smelt iron, creating a blast furnace utilization coefficient record of 0.56. The Hasaeng Coal Mine used hydraulic mining methods, increasing labor productivity by 85% in the third quarter. The Tokchon Automobile Repair Factory and the Rakwon, Bukjung, and Giyang machinery factories all started producing automobiles, tractors, bulldozers, excavators, and other machinery respectively. Workers at the Sinuiju Pulp Mill successfully trial-produced rayon pulp using reeds.

The report said that in the third quarter of this year, more than 960 local factories were established in cities and counties in northern Korea, and local industries will produce more than twice as many products next year as this year.

The report said that agricultural collectivization was fully implemented in northern Korea by the end of August this year, and a nationwide movement to expand irrigation areas and control mountains and rivers is now underway. Although northern Korea experienced a severe drought this year, thanks to the innovation of agricultural techniques by farmers at the beginning of this year, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. According to preliminary estimates, this year's grain output will reach 3.9 million tons, an increase of 700,000 tons compared with last year. Fruit production increased by 14% compared with last year, and cotton increased tenfold.

The report said that basic construction has developed rapidly in the first nine months of this year. The Sunchon Aspirin Factory was newly built, the restoration and expansion project of the Supung Power Station with a power generation capacity of 700,000 kilowatts was completed one year and four months ahead of schedule, and the Haizhou-Hasaeng railway laying project was completed nine months ahead of schedule. Many restoration and expansion projects such as the No. 4 open-hearth furnace of the Hwanghae Iron Works and the No. 2 converter of the Chongjin Steel Plant have also been completed. In addition, a number of large-scale new construction and expansion projects such as power stations, blast furnaces, coal mines, cement plants, and textile factories are proceeding rapidly.

The report said that in the first nine months of this year, 260,000 square meters of housing were built in various places, and many schools, nurseries, clinics, and other facilities were also built.

The report said that in the first nine months of this year, the monetary wages of employees increased by 6% compared with the same period last year, and the income of farmers also increased.

Compared with last year, the number of junior high school students increased by 296,000 and the number of high school, technical vocational school and university students increased by 30,000. In addition, the compulsory junior high school education system will be implemented from November 1 this year.

The report said that in order to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea at its September plenary session to expand the irrigated area by one million chongbo and vigorously develop the metal industry, workers in various factories and construction sites have made resolutions to increase labor productivity by two to four times, and members of agricultural cooperatives are striving to produce ten tons of rice per chongbo of paddy field and six to seven tons of grain per chongbo of dry land next year. Staff members of agencies are working hard to streamline half of the personnel and improve work efficiency. (Attached picture)

    朝鲜工农业革新技术比翼齐飞
    今年头三季工业产值比去年同期增长34％
    农业获得了空前丰收　棉花产量增加了十倍
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜中央通讯社今天发表了关于朝鲜今年第三季度人民经济计划执行总结的报道。报道说，朝鲜今年头九个月超额10％完成了工业总产值计划，比去年同期增加了34％。
    报道说，在今年第三季度，各工业部门由于大胆地采用了新的技术，打破了旧的技术指标，掀起了生产大革新运动。黄海制铁所的职工用铁焦炼铁，创造了高炉利用系数○·五六的纪录。下圣煤矿用水力采煤法采煤，第三季度劳动生产率提高了85％。德川汽车修配厂和乐原、北中、歧阳等机械厂都分别开始生产汽车、拖拉机、推土机、掘土机等。新义州纸浆厂的职工用芦苇试制成功了人造丝浆。
    报道说，在今年第三季度，朝鲜北部各市、郡建立了九百六十多座地方工厂，地方工业在明年将生产比今年多二倍以上的产品。
    报道说，朝鲜北部在今年8月底已经全部实行了农业合作化，现在正进行全民性的扩大灌溉面积、治山治水的运动。今年朝鲜北部虽然发生大旱，但是由于农民在今年年初革新了农业技术，获得了空前的丰收。据初步估计，今年的粮食产量将达三百九十万吨，比去年增加七十万吨。水果产量比去年增加14％，棉花增加十倍。
    报道说，今年头九个月的基本建设获得迅速的发展。新建成了顺川阿斯匹林工厂，提前一年零四个月完成了发电能力达七十万瓩的水丰发电站的恢复扩建工程，提前九个月完成了海州—下圣的铁道敷设工程。还完成了黄海制铁所第四号平炉、清津炼钢厂第二号转炉等许多恢复扩建工程。另外，还有多项发电站、高炉、煤矿、水泥厂、纺织厂等大规模的新建和扩建工程正在迅速进行着。
    报道说，在今年头九个月，各地建成了二十六万平方公尺的住宅，还建设了许多学校，托儿所、诊疗所等。
    报道说，在今年头九个月，职工的货币工资比去年同期增加了6％，农民的收入也有增加。
    今年的新学年同去年相比，初中学生增加了二十九万六千名，高中、技术专门学校和大学的学生比去年增加三万人。另外，将从今年11月1日开始实行初中义务教育制。
    报道说，为了响应朝鲜劳动党中央委员会9月全会提出的扩大灌溉面积一百万町步和大力发展金属工业的号召，各工厂和建设工地的工人们纷纷作出决议，要把劳动生产率提高两倍到四倍，农业社社员们正在为争取明年每町步水田生产十吨稻谷、每町步旱田生产六、七吨粮食而奋斗。机关工作人员正在为精简一半人员和提高工作效率而努力。（附图片）
