    Everything for Steel
    Cao Ming
    Triumphant News Late at Night
    Late at night, red flags fluttered in the square in front of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and cheers shook the clear night sky. Joyful gongs, drums, and exploding firecrackers summoned the sleeping people. Many residents, shop assistants, and cadres from government offices braved the cold autumn night to rush to the square enthusiastically. Why were people so excited and lively? It turned out that the steelworkers had launched another big "satellite," reporting good news to the Party: a daily output of 15,000 tons of iron and 20,200 tons of steel.

    This contingent of soldiers on the steel front had just left the blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, heating furnaces, sintering furnaces, and work sites with temperatures of thousands of degrees. They carried red cards announcing their victory to report to the Party. Five days earlier, Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Li Fuchun of the Party Central Committee brought the concern and instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The tens of thousands of workers, who were gloriously called the main force of steel, were working day and night, doing everything possible and forgetting to eat and sleep, to fight for 4.5 million tons of steel.

    The steel city was boiling. Factory directors and Party committee secretaries had long moved to live next to the furnaces; managers and municipal party secretaries also frequently solved key problems on-site day and night. Veteran cadres and veteran workers studying in schools could not sit still and returned to the site to participate in this meaningful battle. Hundreds of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the steelworkers carried their bedding to the factory, vowing not to return home until the leap forward task was completed. As for the workers who did not go back after work and voluntarily helped others, there were too many to count. For the sake of 10.7 million tons, the people here were willing to dedicate all their energy and wisdom. Every night, many people paved the way for the steel marshal. Commercial staff delivered the most nutritious food to the factory, cooks delivered carefully prepared meals to the workshops, and medical staff waited day and night in the workshops to see workers. The Young Pioneers constantly wrote letters of慰问 to the uncles of the steel warriors. ... These tens of thousands of steel warriors had never been so excited and motivated as they were during this period.

    In the past, some workers were afraid of meetings, but now, after work, many people would ask, "Is there any communication today?" How willing people were to hear what instructions the Party had today? What did Chairman Mao exhort?
      “Dear Party, respected Chairman Mao, we must thoroughly liberate our minds, open the door of wisdom, and vow to complete and exceed the task of 4.5 million tons.” This was the steelworkers' answer to the Party and Chairman Mao, holding high the indicators of the first victory.

    The night was deep, and the autumn night weather was cool and crisp, but the hearts of the steelworkers were fiery. They had molten lava-like words that could not be exhausted in their hearts, but words always had limitations; there was no need to say anything more, put all the thousands of words, the inexhaustible enthusiasm and energy, and the infinite gratitude and love into hard work. The language written with bigger and bigger "satellites" will be the most beautiful language.

    Yang Jianye and Xing Rilun

    In order to ensure the smooth running of steel production, equipment maintenance workers would stay on the 150-ton crane whenever steel was being tapped, so as to be able to repair it in time in the event of an accident. That day, it was young worker Yang Jianye on duty. He squatted there, carefully watching as the steel flowed out like a waterfall. Suddenly, the crane hanging the steel ladle could not move. Yang Jianye saw that the live wire on the sliding wire was broken. He was about to run forward to repair it, but he thought that the sliding wire was electrified, and it would be dangerous for him to run over. But then he thought, if it was not repaired immediately, once the ladle was full, the molten steel would inevitably spill onto the ground, causing a serious accident and affecting the completion of the 4.5 million tons. Thinking of this, he couldn't care less and ventured to repair it. As he ran, he heard his apprentice below warning him, "Don't go, it's electrified." He couldn't care about that; rescue was the priority. Besides, he was wearing insulated rubber shoes. Sure enough, he was quick and skillful, and it only took a minute to connect the wire. By the time the molten steel was full, the crane was already able to rotate freely. A joyful applause erupted below, and his apprentice also breathed a sigh of relief; but Yang Jianye did not hear any of this. What he heard and remembered firmly was the Party's voice: Fight to complete and exceed 4.5 million tons.

    Xing Rilun was a young steelmaking worker who also refused to leave after work. That day, after work, he was happily helping the workers of the next shift. Suddenly, he noticed that the furnace door needed to be replaced, but it was the melting stage, and the flames were scorching, making it impossible to go up. Xing Rilun thought it was not good, if the furnace door was not replaced, it would inevitably prolong the smelting time, "Hmm, launching 'satellites' cannot be delayed on this furnace." He quickly tied a straw bag soaked in water around himself and climbed up to replace the furnace door. The golden-red flames surrounded him fiercely, as if to swallow him; but he was calm and agile. Looking at his attire and his calm and unhurried posture, he looked like a god in mythology undergoing fire refining. Many workers in front of the furnace also nervously helped him, and the comrades of the cultural troupe in front of the platform sweated for him, wondering if he had a body of steel? No, he did not have a body of steel, only a heart of steel. After two minutes, he replaced the furnace door and jumped down safely, his body full of white smoke. Everyone hugged him and hurriedly untied his straw bag and took off his clothes. The workers of this shift felt that this was something they should have done themselves, but now that the people of the previous shift had rushed to do it, they felt uneasy and their eyes flashed with special gratitude. But Xing Rilun did not think so. He believed that everyone was responsible for overcoming difficulties for the sake of 4.5 million tons.

    People Who Dare to Think and Act

    Since Comrade Li Fuchun gave a report to the Anshan Iron and Steel workers, people's minds have become active, and they have been focusing on steel production. Liu Tieling, a foreman of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, was puzzled by the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. How could this new, modern open-hearth furnace be combined with indigenous methods? Although he was puzzled, he was convinced that he could find this path. Sure enough, the Central Committee's wise instructions greatly encouraged him. He suddenly thought of using compressed air to make steel in small converters. Why can't large open-hearth furnaces use compressed air earlier? So, with the support of the leadership, he successfully tested using compressed air to blow the molten iron first when it was sent to the mixer; after mixing the molten iron, compressed air was blown in the open-hearth furnace in advance. In this way, the melting time was reduced from the previous four hours to two hours and fifty-five minutes, shortening the smelting time of each furnace by one hour and five minutes. Once this experience was successful, it was immediately推广 to all steel plants the next day.

    In the past, the workers' suggestion to use large bars when casting ingots was now敢于adopted and immediately put into practice. The habit of many engineering and technical personnel blindly believing in books is beginning to waver and collapse. Some people use exquisite slide rules to calculate, and no matter what, they cannot calculate 4.5 million tons. But look at the "satellites" launched by the workers these days! The daily output of the No. 2 Steelmaking Plant in early September was still more than 5,000 tons, but on the day Comrade Li Fuchun gave the report, it reached 7,030 tons, and on September 29, it launched an 8,800-ton "satellite." Now, they have set new targets for themselves: a thousand-ton furnace, a ten-thousand-ton plant!

    一切为了钢
    草明
    深夜报捷
    深夜，中共鞍山市委门前的广场上红旗飘展，欢呼声震动着晴澈的夜空，欢乐的锣鼓、怒放的鞭炮召唤着安睡的人们。许多居民、店员、机关干部冒着秋夜的寒风，热情地奔赴广场。人们为什么这样欢腾热闹？原来是钢铁工人们又放了个大“卫星”，向党来报捷：日产铁一万五千吨，钢二万零二百吨。
    这支钢铁战线上的战士刚刚离开了一千几百度高温的高炉、平炉、加热炉、烧结炉和工作现场，扛着报喜的红牌来向党报捷。在五天以前，党中央的邓小平、李富春等同志捎来了党中央和毛主席的关怀和指示。光荣地被称为钢铁主力军的十几万职工，为了不辜负党和全国人民的期望，日日夜夜都在千方百计、废寝忘餐地为四百五十万吨钢战斗。
    钢都的人沸腾起来了。厂长、党委书记们早就搬到炉旁去住；经理、市委书记也经常日日夜夜在现场解决关键问题。在学校里学习的老干部和老工人也不能安静下来学习，跑回现场来参加这场有意义的战斗。钢铁工人中的共产党员和共青团员，数以百计地把铺盖扛到厂里，不完成跃进任务誓不回家。至于下班后不回去，自动帮助别人干活的职工，那更是数也数不清了。为了一千零七十万吨，这儿的人民都心甘情愿地献出自己的全部精力和智慧。每天夜里，多少人为钢铁元帅开道，商业工作人员，把最有营养的食品送到工厂，炊事员把精心制作的饭食送到车间，医务人员日夜候在车间为工人看病。少先队不断给钢铁战士的叔叔们写慰问信。……这十几万钢铁战士从来没有像这个时期那样激动和奋发过的。
    过去有些工人怕开会，但是现在下了班，准会有许多人问：“今天有什么传达没有？”人们多么愿意听听今天党有什么指示没有？毛主席有什么嘱咐没有？
      “亲爱的党，敬爱的毛主席，我们一定彻底解放思想，打开智慧的大门，誓要完成并超过四百五十万吨的任务。”这是工人们高举着第一仗胜利的指标，对党和毛主席的回答。
    夜已深，秋夜的天气又是凉飒飒的，但是钢铁工人的心是火热的。他们心里有着熔岩似的说不完的话，但是，话语总是有限度的；不必再说什么，把千言万语、把永远用不完的热情和精力、把无限的感激和热爱都放到干劲里去吧。用一个比一个大的“卫星”写出来的语言，将是最美的语言。
    杨建业和邢日伦
    为了出钢能顺利进行，设备维护工人看见出钢就先呆在一百五十吨的大吊车上，以便发生事故时能及时修理。那一天，正是青年工人杨建业值班，他蹲在那儿细细的瞅着，钢像飞瀑似地奔出来，吊挂盛钢罐的吊车突然不能动弹了，杨建业一看，原来是滑线道上的火线烧断了。他正想跑前去修理，但一想，滑线道有电，他跑过去是危险的。可是他再一想，要是不立刻修理，等大罐装满了，钢水势必溢到地面上，将会发生严重的事故，影响四百五十万吨的完成。想到这，他顾不了这许多，便冒险前去修理，他边跑时边听见底下的徒弟警告他说：“不能去，那有电啊。”他哪里管得了这些？抢救要紧啊。何况他脚底下穿了绝缘的胶鞋哩。果然，他手急眼快，只消一分钟就把线接好。等钢水盛满时，吊车早已能灵活自如地转动了。底下爆发了愉快的鼓掌声，他的徒弟也放下心来轻轻嘘了一口气；但是这一切杨建业都没有听见，他听见的，并且牢牢记住的，是党的声音：为完成和超过四百五十万吨而战斗。
    邢日伦是个青年的炼钢工人，也是下了班不肯走的一个。那一天下了班之后他正帮助下一班的工友干得满高兴；忽然发现炉门要换，但是那一阵正是熔化阶段，火焰逼人，实在无法上去。邢日伦一想不好，要是不换炉门，势必延长了冶炼时间，“唔，放‘卫星’不能耽误在这个炉子上”。他连忙随手用水浸湿了的草袋捆在身上，便提着炉门爬上去换上了。金红色的烈焰凶恶地包围着他，好像要吞掉了他；而他却又镇静又敏捷地动作着。看他那一身的打扮，和他那副不慌不乱的姿态，他活像神话里经历着火炼的神仙一样。炉前的许多工友也紧张地帮着他干，平台前文工团的同志直为他捏把汗，怀疑他是否有一副钢铁的身子？不，他没有钢铁似的身子，只有一个钢铁的心吧了。过了两分钟工夫，他换好炉门安全地跳下来了，身上全冒着白烟，大家一把抱着他，急忙为他解草袋、脱衣服。这班的工人觉得这是应该自己干的事，现在让上一班的人抢了去干，心里很不安；眼睛里闪着特别的感激的光辉。可是邢日伦却不是那么想，他认为为了四百五十万吨，人人有责克服困难。
    敢想敢干的人
    自从李富春同志给鞍钢工人做了报告之后，人们的脑子就活跃起来，尽在钢铁生产上花心思。第一炼钢厂的一个工长刘铁岭对土洋结合很搔头，这样新式的现代化的平炉，怎样土洋结合呢？他虽然搔头，但是他深信可以找到这条途径的。果然，中央的英明的指示大大鼓舞了他，他忽然想起小转炉的用吹压缩空气炼钢来了。为什么大型平炉不能提早用吹压缩空气来炼？于是他在领导的支持下，试验成功了在铁水送入混铁炉时先用压缩空气吹；兑铁水后，平炉内也提前吹压缩空气。这样，使熔化时间由过去的四个钟头降为二点五十五分钟。使每炉钢缩短了一个钟头零五分。这个经验一经成功，第二天便立刻推广到所有炼钢厂去了。
    过去，工人多次建议的，铸锭时用的大棒头，现在也敢于采用，并立刻付诸实行了。许多工程技术人员迷信书本的习惯正在开始动摇和崩溃。有些人用精致的计算尺来算，无论如何也算不出四百五十万吨。但是，瞧瞧这几天工人们放的“卫星”吧！第二炼钢厂9月上旬的日产量还在五千多吨，就在李富春同志做报告那天就达到七千零三十吨，9月29日便放出了八千八百吨的“卫星”来。现在呢，他们又给自己订下新的指标：千吨炉子万吨厂！
