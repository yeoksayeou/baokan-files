Ideological Debate in the Workshop
Shanxi Daily Reporters Zhao Bingying, Ma Chaojun

In a collective workshop in the ventilation shop, the electric lights were dazzling, and the workers, after a day's work, were still full of energy. Some were holding kettles and drinking tea, and some were gathered together playing cards. Nie Tiezhu, the Party Branch Secretary, walked in from his office, and the workers habitually started chatting with him.

Nie Tiezhu casually asked, "What do you say we work for every day?"

Old worker Liu Guonian smiled and said, "What for? If it weren't for this mouth to feed, I wouldn't want to move at all." Wu Chengbao, sitting next to him, jokingly said, "If you ask me, others are probably doing it for socialism, but we're doing it for our wives and children." Before he could finish, Jiang Deqing chimed in: "Bull! For socialism? I think that no matter how high a person's awareness is, if you don't give him a penny, he definitely won't do it."

These words from the three of them immediately sparked a heated debate, with some agreeing and some disagreeing. Old workers Zhang Yin'ai, Feng Changsuo, and Zhang Jianghai used their own personal experiences to explain that workers in the old society suffered and struggled but were always unable to eat their fill or dress warmly, and their wives and children lived lives worse than animals; some couldn't even afford to get married. After liberation, workers not only gradually enjoyed a better life but also truly became the masters of the factory. The result of the debate was that working for food, for money, and for wives and children was a selfish and erroneous idea at play; socialism is the lifeline of the working class, and without socialism, workers would have nothing, so they should concentrate their efforts on building socialism. This immediately awakened Liu Guonian, Wu Chengbao, and others. They made self-criticisms on the spot, expressing that they would work even harder. Soon, they both received "Glorious Flowers" for their outstanding work achievements.

Such debate meetings are truly lively and vigorous and are now being widely used in various dormitory areas. For example, in order to complete a new production task, if some individuals have a poor work attitude, or whether a rationalization proposal put forward by someone is feasible, everyone likes to engage in debate. In particular, if the tasks of various teams and groups are not completed well on a given day, they always investigate the reasons in their own rooms and formulate measures for improvement the next day. Workers are willing to talk to the branch about what they see, what they hear, and what they are thinking; any arrangements and calls made by the branch will immediately be turned into practical actions by the workers.

This situation would not have occurred at all before the readjustment of the dormitories. Before the readjustment of the dormitories, because workers lived scattered and in disarray, it was impossible for the Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations to carry out political and ideological work in depth because they had neither the time nor the position. Now, after the readjustment of the dormitories, the Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the entire mine and various workshops have moved their offices to the workers' dormitory areas to work, which makes it possible to use the workers' ample rest time and various occasions to carry out political and ideological work.

    思想论战在工房
    山西日报记者　赵秉英　马超骏
    在通风车间的一间集体工房里，电灯光耀眼，工作了一天的工人们还是那么精神焕发，有的捧着水壶喝茶，有的围在一起玩扑克牌。党支部书记聂铁柱从他的办公室走了进来，工人们习惯地和他攀谈起来。
    聂铁柱随便问道：“你们说咱们天天劳动为了啥？”
    老工人刘过年笑了笑说：“为了啥？要不是为了这壳壳（嘴），我早就不想动了。”坐在他身旁的吴成保半开玩笑地说：“要叫我说，别人大概人家是为了社会主义，咱咯就是为了老婆孩子。”不等他说完，姜德清就开腔了：“球！为了社会主义？我看他再觉悟高的一个人，假如一个钱也不给他，保险他不干。”
    他们三个人的这一席话，立即引起了热烈的争论，有的赞成，有的反对。老工人张银艾、冯长锁、张江孩就以自己的亲身经历，说明工人在旧社会受死受活，但始终是吃不饱，穿不暖，老婆孩子都过着牛马不如的生活，有的就根本娶不起老婆；解放以后，工人们不但生活逐渐美满，而且真正做了工厂的主人。辩论的结果是，为嘴、为钱、为老婆孩子而劳动，是一种自私自利的错误观念在作怪；社会主义是工人的命根子，没有社会主义就没有工人的一切，所以应当集中精力来建设社会主义。这一下子，就把刘过年、吴成保等人说醒了，他们当场做了检查，表示要更艰苦地进行劳动，不久他们两人就因劳动成绩突出，戴上了“光荣花”。
    这样的辩论会真是生动活泼，现在在各个宿舍区已经普遍运用起来了，比如为了完成一件新的生产任务，个别人劳动态度不好，某人提出的合理化建议是否可行等问题，大家都喜欢进行辩论。特别是各个队、组若是今日任务完成的不好，总要在自己的房间里追查原因，订出明天改进的措施。工人们看到什么、听到什么和自己在想些什么，都愿意和支部谈谈；支部有什么布置和号召，立即就会变成工人们的实际行动。
    这种情况，在未调整宿舍以前，是根本不会出现的。在调整宿舍前，由于工人居住分散和混乱，党、工、团组织要想深入地开展政治思想工作便既没有时间，也没有阵地。现在，调整宿舍后，全矿和各个车间的党、工、团组织，都将自己的办公室搬在工人宿舍区里去办公，这就可以利用工人充裕的休息时间和各种场合去进行政治思想工作了。（附图片）
