Ningxia folk song

Ningxia is a good place, known as "Little Paradise Beyond the Great Wall." The Yellow River banks are all green, and the canals are like spider webs. The river water is fertile, and the soil is strong. As long as you plant seeds, you can harvest grain. Fruit trees are planted in rows, and the mountains are full of cattle and sheep. "The Yellow River enriches Ningxia," Ningxia is truly a good place.

    宁夏民歌宁夏是个好地方，人称“塞外小天堂”，黄河两岸一片绿，水渠好似蜘蛛网，河水肥，土质强，只要下种就打粮，果子树，排成行，山上到处是牛羊，“天下黄河富宁夏”，宁夏真是个好地方。
