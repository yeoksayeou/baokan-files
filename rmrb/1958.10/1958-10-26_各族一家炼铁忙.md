All Ethnic Groups Work Together to Smelt Iron

　　In a field of abundant harvest, more than four hundred indigenous blast furnaces suddenly sprang up. Above the furnace clusters, thick smoke filled the air. Amidst the rumbling sound of various blowers, the smelting army was tensely engaged in furnace-front operations. In this team were Tibetan men wearing riding boots, and Tu women wearing felt hats and silver-lined robes. This place is called Xinhe Village, the smelting base of the Shatangchuan People's Commune in the Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County. The Han, Tu, and Tibetan people of this commune have formed a steel force under the banner of iron and steel, camping here from within a sixty-mile radius to smelt iron. Using hands that had just put down their sickles, people have built this "steel base" to a roughly complete scale. Many furnaces have already tapped molten iron.

　　Smelting iron was a completely unfamiliar task for the farmers. At first, they said: Hands that hold the plow, how can they smelt iron! Now, one-third of the furnace chiefs have mastered furnace-front operating techniques, and more than one hundred and forty furnaces have their own technicians. The Liu Hulan team, led by Tu woman Wang Yulan, has trained four female furnace chiefs and four female technicians in a very short time, and most of the team members have learned general furnace-front techniques such as observing flame color, tapping iron, and batching materials. They contracted two furnaces to compete with the men. To learn smelting techniques as soon as possible, they stayed at the furnace for three days and nights without sleep, constantly learning how to operate. One day, it was pouring rain, and their clothes were soaked and stuck to their bodies, but none of them left the furnace until the molten iron flowed out. More than four hundred indigenous blast furnaces rose abruptly from the ground, and the two hundred and forty households of Xinhe Village suddenly increased by more than ten thousand people. Some families moved out of their houses to accommodate people from other villages, and some consciously and voluntarily temporarily broke up their families, with men living together and women living together. During the furnace construction, the Tibetan and Han residents of Xinhe Village saw the shortage of materials, and more than eighty households dismantled their steps, flowerbeds, and walls, and sent stone slabs, earthen bricks, and red sand to the furnace side.

    各族一家炼铁忙
    一片丰收的田野里，蓦地建起了四百多座土高炉。炉群上空，浓烟弥漫。在各式各样的鼓风机的隆隆声中，冶炼大军紧张地进行着炉前操作。这支队伍中有足蹬马靴的藏族男子，也有头戴毡帽、身穿银边长袍的土族妇女。这个地方名叫新合村，是互助土族自治县沙塘川人民公社的冶炼基地。这个公社的汉、土、藏三个民族的人们在钢铁帅旗下组成了一支钢铁队伍，从方圆六十里的地方到这里宿营炼铁。人们用刚刚放下镰刀的双手，把这个“钢铁基地”建设得粗具规模了。许多炉子已经流出了铁水。
    炼铁对于农民，是一件完全陌生的事。开始时他们说：扶犁的手，炼铁咋行！现在，已经有三分之一的炉长掌握了炉前操作技术，一百四十多个炉子有了自己的技术员。土族妇女王玉兰领导的刘胡兰队，在很短的时间内，已培养出四个女炉长和四个女技术员，大部分队员都学会了看火色、出铁和配料等炉前一般技术。她们包干了两个炉子同男子比赛。为了早日学好冶炼技术，她们曾三天三夜没有睡觉，一直在炉前学习操作。有一天，下着倾盆大雨，衣服被雨淋得贴在身上，他们谁也没有离开炉子，直到铁水流出。四百多个土高炉平地突起，二百四十户的新合村一下增加了一万多人。有的全家迁让出房子给外村人住，有的自觉自愿地临时拆开了家庭，男人集中在一起住，女人集中在另一起住。建炉时，新合村的藏汉族居民看到材料缺乏，就有八十多户人家把台阶、花台、围墙等拆掉，拿出石板、土砖、红砂送到炉边。　杨立本　金元明　李景瑞
