Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 8th, during which a lengthy debate took place regarding the order of discussion for various proposals on the committee's agenda.

    Soviet representative Zorin emphasized that the various agenda items related to disarmament were the most important and pressing. Among these, the issue of ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons was the most amenable to resolution.

    Referring to the upcoming talks in Geneva among the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom on this issue, Zorin pointed out that the matter was not only related to these countries but also concerned the interests of all member states of the United Nations. If the General Assembly could call on the participants in the talks to universally and unconditionally cease nuclear weapon tests, it would have the most beneficial impact on both the process and the outcome of the talks themselves.

    Zorin said that the Soviet delegation believed that the committee should immediately begin discussing the issue of ceasing nuclear weapon tests.

    Zorin suggested that after discussing this issue, the committee should discuss the issue of reducing military budgets or the peaceful use of outer space, and then discuss the issue of disarmament, at which point the Soviet government's memorandum and the United Nations Secretary-General's report should be included in the discussion. The committee could determine the order of discussion for the remaining issues at a later stage.

    Representatives of Western countries, including those from the United States and the United Kingdom, were unable to present any arguments against the aforementioned suggestions of the Soviet representative. However, the U.S. representative suggested simultaneously discussing all items related to disarmament. He insisted that the committee and the General Assembly had consistently discussed the entire issue of disarmament in the past.

    This position of the U.S. delegation demonstrates that the United States is attempting to submerge the resolution of certain specific issues where some progress has been made in the field of disarmament, into other disarmament issues. It is precisely this approach that has led to a deadlock in the resolution of disarmament issues in the past and has hindered the resolution of certain specific aspects of disarmament.

    Soviet representative Zorin spoke again, suggesting that the items related to disarmament should be specifically discussed based on their importance, urgency, and the degree of progress that has been made. He pointed out that the U.S. representative's insistence on a package deal for disarmament issues was untenable. Zorin asked: Why repeat the unsuccessful approach that has rendered disarmament fruitless and has led to a deadlock?

    Zorin put forward a compromise suggestion: the committee should first discuss the issue of ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and then determine the order of discussion for the other items on the agenda.

### 苏联代表在联大政委会主张  停止核试验应列入首项议程

    苏联代表在联大政委会主张
    停止核试验应列入首项议程
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在8日上午举行会议，会上就委员会议程上各项提案的讨论次序进行了长时间的辩论。
    苏联代表佐林着重指出，同裁军问题有关的各项议程是最重要的和最迫切的问题。而其中最有条件解决的问题是停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题。
    佐林在谈到苏美英三国即将在日内瓦就这个问题举行的会谈时指出，这个问题不仅同这些国家有关，而且还涉及联合国所有成员国的利益。如果大会能呼吁会谈的参加国普遍地、无条件地停止试验核武器，那就无论是对会谈的进程本身还是对会谈的结果都会起最良好的影响。
    佐林说，苏联代表团认为，委员会应当立即开始讨论停止试验核武器问题。
    佐林建议，在讨论了这个问题以后，就讨论削减军事预算问题或者和平利用宇宙空间问题，然后讨论裁军问题，这时应该把苏联政府的备忘录和联合国秘书长的报告包括在这个问题内一并讨论。其余问题的讨论次序，委员会可以在以后的阶段中确定。
    西方国家的代表，其中包括美英两国的代表，无法提出任何论点来反对苏联代表的上述建议。但是美国代表建议同时讨论同裁军问题有关的所有项目。他硬说委员会和大会在过去一向是讨论整个裁军问题的。
    美国代表团的这种立场表明：美国企图使裁军方面已经取得一定成就的某些具体问题的解决，淹没在其他一些裁军问题之中。正是这种做法在过去使得裁军问题的解决陷入僵局，并且阻碍了裁军方面某些具体问题的解决。
    苏联代表佐林再次发言，建议根据同裁军问题有关的各个项目的重要性、迫切性和已经取得的进展程度，具体地讨论这些项目。他指出，美国代表坚持要一揽子讨论裁军问题的理由是站不住脚的。佐林问道：为什么要重复那种使裁军问题毫无成果并且陷入僵局的不的好做法呢？
    佐林提出一个折衷建议：委员会先讨论停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题，然后再确定议程上其他项目讨论的次序。
