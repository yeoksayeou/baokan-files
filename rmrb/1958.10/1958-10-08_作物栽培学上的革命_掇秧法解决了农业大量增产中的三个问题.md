A Revolution in Crop Cultivation
The "Duoyang" Method Solves Three Problems in Massive Agricultural Production Increase
Fang Cuinong

The great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 has shattered many outdated viewpoints in agricultural science, and many problems must be re-examined and new theories sought based on new production practices.

In August, while we were working in Xingguo, Jiangxi, racking our brains on how to increase the yield of intercropped late rice to achieve the county committee's goal of 1,200 catties per mu of grain, the news of Jian'guo First Commune in Macheng, Hubei, achieving 37,000 catties per mu of early rice was a great inspiration to us. So we proposed the suggestion of "moving the yahe (intercropped late rice)," and after three days and nights of hard work, we moved more than 20 mu of "yahe" to these 2.76 mu of paddy fields. After another seven days, we plowed and planted sweet potatoes on more than 15 mu of non-waterlogged paddy fields where the "yahe" had been moved from. Originally, they didn't have much confidence in these "yahe" yielding 100 catties per mu, but now, for both rice and sweet potatoes, they've put up signs striving for a yield of 10,000 catties per mu. However, some agricultural scientists doubt the significance of this "duoyang" method in production practice, even slandering it as a "trick" for launching satellites. We believe that the "duohe" experience of rice, first created by the masses in Hubei in 1958, is a creation of extremely high scientific value and a revolution in crop cultivation because:

One, even on the basis of high-density planting of 70,000 to 80,000 plants per mu, after the "duoyang" transplanting, more than two-thirds of the paddy field area can still be freed up to plant succeeding crops 40 to 50 days earlier. This creates the most valuable time conditions for the high yield of succeeding crops.

Two, it overcomes the contradiction of excessive growth during the jointing stage and insufficient nutrition in the later stage of rice under high-density planting conditions. The paddy field, after being re-plowed, fertilized, and transplanted, can undoubtedly inhibit excessive growth and create better conditions for later development, making the rice stalks short, the grains full, the number of unfilled grains small, and resulting in higher yields.

Three, the adoption of this method allows for huge yields of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of catties per mu, which lays a scientific foundation for future agricultural industrialization, especially for artificially controlled agricultural production under unfavorable climatic conditions.

We deeply realize that 1958 is truly a great era where "one day is equal to twenty years." In the past, many agricultural scientists always wanted farmers to do things according to their own methods, and if the farmers didn't accept it, they would think they were backward, never considering that they themselves were backward. In the past, researching something new always took many years before it could be presented. Now, the creations of the masses of peasants who have liberated their minds are like bamboo shoots after the rain, each one more advanced than the last, demonstrating to us. Not only are the cultivation techniques of many high-yield satellite fields things we wouldn't have dared to imagine in the past, but even the breeding of new varieties, such as distant hybridization of rice and sorghum, which crop breeders are still debating, has now been successfully cultivated by Jiang Shaofang in Guangxi and He Laichang in Jiangxi, these young people with communist spirit who dare to think and act. They have provided a large number of seeds to production in only three or four years.

This situation forces us to consider that in the future, agricultural scientific research work can only thoroughly break with those outdated viewpoints and practices, and humbly become students of the masses, in order to elevate the rich practices and creations of the revolutionary masses into new agricultural scientific theories.

    作物栽培学上的革命
    掇秧法解决了农业大量增产中的三个问题
    方悴农
    1958年的农业生产大跃进，在农业科学上打破了许多陈旧的观点，许多问题都须在新的生产实践的基础上，求得新的认识和新的理论。
    8月里，我们在江西兴国工作，正在为如何提高间作晚稻的产量以实现县委提出的粮食亩产一千二百斤的任务而动脑筋想办法时。湖北麻城建国一社亩产三万七千斤早稻的消息发出来了，这对我们是一个很大的启发。于是我们提出“桠禾（间作晚稻）搬家”的建议，经过三昼夜苦战，把二十多亩“桠禾”都移到这二亩七分六厘的稻田里来，又经过七天的时间把移走“桠禾”十五亩多不积水的稻田都耕翻后种上甘薯。原来他们对这些“桠禾”亩产百斤的信心也不大，现在他们不论水稻和甘薯，都插上牌子要争取亩产万斤。可是也有些农业科学工作者，却怀疑这种“掇秧”的方法在生产实践上的意义，甚至诬蔑这是一种为着放卫星的“取巧”办法。我们以为1958年湖北群众首创的水稻“掇禾”的经验，具有极高科学价值的创造，是作物栽培学上的革命。因为：
    一、即使在每亩七、八万蔸的密植基础上，“掇秧”移植以后，仍可腾出三分之二以上的稻田面积提前四、五十天栽种后熟作物。这对后熟作物的高产创造了最可宝贵的时间条件。
    二、克服在高度密植的条件下水稻拔节期容易发生徒长和后期营养不足的矛盾。稻田经过重新翻耕、施肥和移植，无疑可以抑制徒长，并为后期发育创造更好的条件，使水稻茎秆矮，谷粒饱满，瘪谷少，得到更高的产量。
    三、采用这种方法一亩地上能得到数万斤甚至十数万斤的巨额产量，这就为今后农业工业化，特别是在不良气候条件下用人工控制的农业生产奠定了科学的基础。
    我们深刻地体会到，1958年真是“一天等于二十年”的大时代，过去许多农业科学工作者总想让农民按照自己的办法来办事，农民不接受就认为他落后，从来也没有考虑到原来是自己落后。过去研究一种新东西，总是经历多少年，还拿不出手。现在，解放了思想的农民群众的创造，像雨后春笋，一个比一个更先进地在向我们示范。这不仅是许多作物高产卫星田的栽培技术，过去我们连想都不敢想，就是新品种的培育，像水稻和高粱远缘杂交等，作物选种家们还在争论不休的东西，现在广西的蒋少芳，江西的何来昌这些敢想敢做具有共产主义风格的青年也都已培育成功。他们只用了三四年的时间，就把大量的种子提供到生产上去。
    这种形势，逼使我们不得不考虑到今后农业科学研究工作只有彻底打破那些陈旧的观点和做法，虚心地当群众的学生，才能把革命群众丰富的实践和创造，提高成为新的农业科学理论。
