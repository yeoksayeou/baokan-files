Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th: The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Based on the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5, 1958, and the proactive measures taken by the Government of the People's Republic of China in support of it, all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of this year.

As of October 26, 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea.

In this regard, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea declares as follows:

As is well known, when peace in Korea and the Far East was severely threatened due to the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism, the Chinese People's Volunteers, holding high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, participated in the just struggle of the Korean people.

The noble assistance given by the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean people during the Fatherland Liberation War and the post-war period against U.S. imperialist aggression has made a significant contribution to safeguarding the security of the people of both China and Korea and to peace in the Far East and the world.

Today, the proactive withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has opened a new situation for easing tensions in Korea and promoting a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Under this new situation, the U.S. government should withdraw its troops from South Korea.

Ignoring the resolute protests of the Korean people, the U.S. government has consistently pursued a policy of aggression against Korea. Not only has it failed to withdraw its troops from South Korea, but it has also systematically violated the armistice agreement, greatly increased its military strength in South Korea, and even brought atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, challenging the entire Korean people and peace in the Far East and the world.

All these provocative acts carried out by U.S. imperialism in South Korea prove that it attempts to permanently divide Korea, continue to occupy South Korea as its colony, and turn South Korea into its atomic war base.

The U.S. imperialist occupation of South Korea has become the root cause of the national misfortune and suffering of the Korean people and a fundamental obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea.

It has been more than five years since the Korean armistice, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have already withdrawn first. Today, the U.S. aggressor troops have no excuse to remain in South Korea.

Our motherland cannot achieve peaceful reunification unless the U.S. aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea. This places the South Korean people in an extremely difficult situation and causes great national disaster to the entire Korean people.

Once the U.S. aggressor troops withdraw from South Korea, our motherland can be unified by the Korean people themselves on a democratic basis and through peaceful means.

Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea once again strongly demands that the U.S. aggressor troops immediately withdraw from South Korea.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea emphasizes that the United Nations and its member states should pay due attention to the actions of the U.S. military, which is continuing to occupy South Korea under the guise of the United Nations, hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea. U.S. imperialism should no longer be allowed to carry out aggression against Korea.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is confident that all the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world will actively support the just demand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th:  Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today wrote a letter to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and Malik, President of the Thirteenth Session of the UN General Assembly, regarding the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Regarding the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on October 28, 1958, demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Korea.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea authorizes me to send you the full text of this statement and hopes that the full text of this statement will be transmitted to the representatives of all member states of the United Nations so that they may give it due consideration.

    朝鲜政府就我志愿军全部撤出朝鲜发表声明
    要求美军立即撤出南朝鲜
    南日外务相写信把政府声明通知联合国
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天就中国人民志愿军从朝鲜全部撤出一事发表声明。声明全文如下：
    根据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在1958年2月5日发表的声明和中华人民共和国政府支持它而采取的主动措施，中国人民志愿军全体官兵决定到今年年底为止全部撤出朝鲜。
    中国人民志愿军截至1958年10月26日止，已经全部撤出了朝鲜。
    就此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府声明如下：
    众所周知，在由于美帝国主义的武装侵略，朝鲜和远东的和平遭到严重威胁的时候，中国人民志愿军高举抗美援朝的旗帜，参加了朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略的祖国解放战争时期和战后时期给予朝鲜人民的高贵援助，对于保卫朝中两国人民的安全和远东、世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    今天中国人民志愿军的主动从朝鲜撤出，为缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决打开了新的局面。
    在这种新的局面下，美国政府应该从南朝鲜撤出它的军队。
    美国政府不愿朝鲜人民的坚决抗议，始终一贯地奉行侵略朝鲜的政策。它不但不从南朝鲜撤出它的军队，反而系统地破坏停战协定，大大地增强在南朝鲜的军事力量，甚至把原子武器和导弹武器运入南朝鲜，向全体朝鲜人民和远东与世界和平挑战。
    美帝国主义在南朝鲜进行的这一切挑衅行为证明：它企图永久分裂朝鲜，继续霸占南朝鲜，作为它的殖民地，并把南朝鲜变成它的原子战争基地。
    美帝国主义对南朝鲜的强占成为朝鲜人民的民族不幸和痛苦的根源；成为朝鲜和平统一的根本障碍。
    朝鲜停战以来已经五年多了，中国人民志愿军已经首先撤走，今天美国侵略军队没有任何借口再留在南朝鲜。
    美国侵略军队不从南朝鲜撤走，我们祖国就无法达到和平统一。这使南朝鲜人民处于极端困苦的境地，使全体朝鲜人民遭到极大的民族灾难。
    一旦美国侵略军队由南朝鲜撤走，我们的祖国就可以由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上，以和平的方法来达到统一。
    因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府再一次强烈要求美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤走。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府强调指出，联合国和它的会员国应该对美国军队盗用联合国名义继续强占南朝鲜阻碍朝鲜和平统一的行为，给予应有的注意。再不应该容许美帝国主义对朝鲜进行侵略了。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府确信，全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，将积极支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求美国侵略军队立即从南朝鲜撤出的正义主张。
    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日今天就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表的声明，写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和联合国大会第十三届会议主席马利克。信的全文如下：
    就中国人民志愿军已全部撤出朝鲜这件事，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在1958年10月28日发表声明，要求美国侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府授权本人将这一声明全文送给你们，同时希望将这个声明的全文，转达给联合国全体会员国代表，使他们对此予以应有的关心。
