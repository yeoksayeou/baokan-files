Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Washington: U.S. State Department Spokesman, White, commenting on the major peace initiative of the complete and voluntary withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, disregarded the unanimous demands of the Korean people and the people of the world, and unreasonably refused to withdraw the aggressive American troops from South Korea.

In a statement to reporters, White rejected the demand from the Korean and Chinese side that the United States should take corresponding measures to withdraw all its troops from South Korea.

He shamelessly defended the U.S. refusal to withdraw all troops, saying that the U.S. sent troops to South Korea "at the request of the United Nations," and that a complete U.S. withdrawal "would not help ease tensions in the Far East" and would lose the so-called "necessary guarantee to prevent further aggression in Korea."

However, it is known throughout the world that it was none other than the United States that carried out a barbaric aggression against Korea under the banner of the United Nations; and with the Chinese People's Volunteers having completely withdrawn from Korea today, the purpose of the American aggressor troops still clinging to South Korea is clearly to exacerbate tensions in the Far East and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea.

White also rejected the proposal from the Korean and Chinese side that free elections should be held throughout Korea for a certain period after the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea, and insisted that the Korean and Chinese side accept the bankrupt plan of so-called "free elections (in Korea) under the supervision of the United Nations."

People know that the purpose of this plan is to hold so-called "free elections" in Korea under the bayonets of the United States, in order to impose the dark rule of the American-controlled South Korean puppet regime on the entire Korean people.

### 美国国务院发言人表示  美军还要死赖在南朝鲜

    美国国务院发言人表示
    美军还要死赖在南朝鲜
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特27日在评论中国人民志愿军已经全部主动撤出朝鲜这个重大的和平行动时，不顾朝鲜人民和全世界人民的一致要求，无理地拒绝从南朝鲜撤走美国的侵略军队。
    怀特在对记者发表的声明中表示拒绝朝中方面提出的美国应当采取相应措施把军队全部撤出南朝鲜的要求。
    他无耻地为美国拒绝全部撤军辩护说，美方派兵到南朝鲜去是“应联合国的请求”，美方全部撤军“无助于缓和远东紧张局势”，并将会失去所谓“防止在朝鲜发生进一步侵略的必要保证”。
    但是，举世皆知，盗用了联合国旗帜对朝鲜进行了野蛮侵略的不是别人，正是美国；而在中国人民志愿军已经全部撤离朝鲜的今天，美国侵略军仍然赖在南朝鲜不走其目的显然是为了加剧远东的紧张局势，并且阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。
    怀特还表示拒绝朝中方面关于在一切外国军队撤离朝鲜后的一定时期举行全朝鲜的自由选举以实现朝鲜的和平统一的主张，而硬要朝中方面接受早已破了产的所谓“在联合国监督下（在朝鲜）举行自由选举”的计划。
    人们知道，这个计划的目的是要在美国的刺刀下在朝鲜举行所谓“自由选举”，以便把美国控制的南朝鲜傀儡政权的黑暗统治强加在全朝鲜人民身上。
