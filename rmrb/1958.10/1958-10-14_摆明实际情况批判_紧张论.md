    Exposing the Actual Situation to Criticize the "Tension Theory"
    (Reported by our newspaper) The results of debates and labor force surveys in various parts of Gansu Province have proved that the current labor shortage in rural areas is largely due to the ideological tension of some cadres. Gansu Province, by curing the ideological tension of these cadres, has enabled everyone to give full play to their subjective initiative and actively tap the potential of the labor force. Taking advantage of the favorable conditions after the people's communes, a mass mobilization of farmers, workers, students, shop assistants, cadres, and family members was carried out. In addition to opening up the iron and steel production front, a large agricultural army of three million people was quickly organized to carry out crash autumn harvesting and planting. Now, in some areas where autumn crops ripen earlier, crash harvesting has been completed, and the threshing and milling of grains and the preservation of potatoes are also being carried out simultaneously. Of the 11 million mu of winter wheat in the province, 62% of the sowing area has been completed. In the new situation of intensive steelmaking, some cadres in Gansu have developed illusions, saying that "labor has been transferred to steel" and "there is no one in agriculture," creating a tense atmosphere for a time. Some places even proposed abandoning the autumn harvest.
    The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference to inform cadres at all levels of the province's allocation of labor to support steel production. In fact, of the more than five million laborers in the province, only more than 700,000 are invested in the iron and steel front. The Provincial Committee believes that there is labor potential. Failure to give full play to subjective initiative and tap potential, but empty cries of "insufficient labor" is a conservative idea that should be criticized. The Provincial Committee also clearly stipulated for leading cadres at all levels that, in addition to the leading cadres on the iron and steel front, the remaining leading cadres should contract for agricultural production and bear full responsibility.
    According to the spirit of the Provincial Committee's instructions, local Party committees, on the one hand, conducted investigations and studies on the local labor force situation, and on the other hand, organized cadres and the masses to launch debates on issues such as "Is the labor force insufficient?" and "How to tap the potential of the labor force?" Originally, some people who shouted "insufficient labor" only saw the aspect of transferring labor from agriculture to support the iron and steel front, but did not fully estimate the fact that after the people's communes, everyone participated in production, liberating a large amount of labor force. Nor did they realize that the people's communes could make overall arrangements for the labor force of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and had superiority in improving the social organization of labor. Therefore, when the facts were presented, explaining that although the task of steel production overwhelmed everything, the labor force required for steelmaking was far less than that left in agriculture, those who advocated "Less labor, no way to do autumn harvest and planting" had to admit defeat.
    After a labor force survey in Lintao County, more than 55,000 laborers were drawn to participate in the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) work. The county's 280,000 mu of autumn fields were crash-harvested in just five days. In the debate at Tianjiazhuang in Tianshui County, detailed accounts were calculated. As a result, the potential of the labor force that was unearthed increased by nearly double compared with the conservative estimates of those who advocated "labor shortage." Therefore, everyone concluded that "labor shortage" was not that the labor force was really tight, but that these people were suffering from ideological tension. (Guo Fenxiang)

    摆明实际情况批判“紧张论”
    本报讯　甘肃省各地通过辩论和劳动力摸底的结果，证明目前农村劳动力紧张问题，相当程度上是由于部分干部思想紧张的缘故。甘肃省由于医治了这部分干部的思想紧张病，使大家发挥主观能动性，积极挖掘劳动力的潜力，利用人民公社化后的有利条件，实行农民、工人、学生、店员、干部、家属大动员，在开辟钢铁生产战线以外，迅速组织起三百万农业大军，突击秋收、秋种工作。现在，一些秋田作物成熟较早的地区，已经突击收割完毕，谷类的打、碾和薯类的保藏也在同时进行中。全省一千一百万亩冬麦，已经完成的播种面积达62％。在紧张炼钢炼铁的新情况下，甘肃一些干部产生了错觉，他们说“劳力都调到钢铁上去了”，“农业上没人了”，一时造成紧张气氛，个别地方甚至提出要放弃秋收。
    中共甘肃省委召开了电话会议，把全省调配劳动力支援钢铁的情况告诉了各级干部。事实上在全省五百多万个劳动力中，投入钢铁战线上的只有七十多万。省委认为劳动潜力是有的，不发挥主观能动性、挖掘潜力，而空喊“劳力不足”的做法，是一种保守思想，应该批判。省委还给各级领导干部明确规定：除了钢铁战线上的领导干部外，留下来的领导干部，要对农业生产进行包干，负全部责任。
    各地党委根据省委指示精神，一方面就当地的劳动力情况进行调查研究，一方面组织干部和群众就“劳动力是否不足”、“怎样挖掘劳动力的潜力”等问题展开辩论。本来一些高叫“劳力不足”的人，只是看到从农业上抽调劳动力支援钢铁战线的一方面，而没有充分估计人民公社化后，人人参加生产，解放了大量劳动力的事实，也没有认识到人民公社能够统筹安排工农商学兵劳动力，在改善社会的劳动组织上具有优越性。因此当摆出事实，说明钢铁生产的任务虽然压倒一切，然而炼钢炼铁所需的劳动力远远没有留在农业上的多时，“劳力少秋收秋种没办法论”者只好认输了。
    临洮县经过劳动力摸底后，就抽调出五万五千多劳动力参加了三秋工作，全县二十八万亩秋田，只五天就突击抢收完了。天水县田家庄在辩论中算了细账，结果挖出的劳动力潜力比“劳力不足论”者的保守估计，增加了将近一倍。因此大家给“劳力不足论”者做了个结论：不是劳力真的紧张，而是这些人患了思想紧张病。（郭汾祥）
