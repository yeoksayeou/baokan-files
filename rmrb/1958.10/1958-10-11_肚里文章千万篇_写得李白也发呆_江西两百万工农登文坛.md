According to the Jiangxi Daily, theoretical work in Jiangxi Province has entered a new stage, and a mass writing movement centered on summarizing the experience of socialist construction has emerged throughout the province.

Currently, more than two million people in the province are participating in the writing movement, including cadres, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and more than four million articles have been written. In Duchang County, an average of one article has been written per farmer household. Workers and peasants have demonstrated great ambition in this writing movement. Some workers wrote in a poem: "Writing articles comes easily, now workers have become scholars, innumerable articles in their bellies, written so well that Li Bai would be dumbfounded." Some people think that peasants are not scholars or successful candidates, how can they write articles? But many farmers retorted: "Scholars and successful candidates can write but cannot do, we can do and can write, they are scholars, we are geniuses." The articles they write are closely centered on the central work, serving politics and production. The subjects are diverse, comprehensively reflecting the political and economic outlook since the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward in production. Moreover, they directly promote the Great Leap Forward in production and the technological and cultural revolutions.

Although the cultural level of workers and peasants is relatively low, and they have encountered sarcasm and opposition from some people, they have overcome all obstacles with tenacious spirit and diligent study, and more and more people are participating in the study. Red and expert schools, spare-time universities, and "three-in-one" schools, which have sprung up everywhere, have generally established philosophy courses. More than three million workers and peasants have been organized and are being organized to study throughout the province.

The party and government leaders of the province are very concerned about and attach great importance to the writing movement and the mass learning of theory. Shao Shiping, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Jiangxi Province, made important instructions on this issue at an on-site meeting held by the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiujiang Special Zone some time ago. He said that Jiangxi has made a great contribution to revolutionary culture. The first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong is all about events that happened in Jiangxi. In China, the combination of Marxism and socialist culture with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and its mastery by the broad masses of workers and peasants, was developed in Jiangxi. He said that now, in the development of socialist and communist culture, we in Jiangxi must strive for the top.

Now, the high tide of the writing movement and the mass learning of theory is developing further, and the enthusiasm of the masses for writing and learning is increasing day by day. (Attached picture)

    肚里文章千万篇　写得李白也发呆
    江西两百万工农登文坛
    据江西日报消息：江西省理论工作已经进入了一个新的阶段，全省出现了一个以总结社会主义建设经验为中心的全民性的写作运动。
    目前，全省参加写作运动的有两百万人以上，包括干部、工人、农民、知识分子，已经写出文章四百多万篇。都昌县平均每一农户写出一篇文章。工农群众在这次写作运动中，表现出伟大的气魄。有的工人题诗曰：“写起文章信手来，如今工人成秀才，肚里文章千万篇，写得李白也发呆。”有人认为农民不是秀才不是举人，怎么能写文章？可是许多农民反驳说：“秀才、举人能写不能做，我们能做得出又能写得出，他们是秀才，我们是天才。”他们写出的文章，紧密围绕着中心工作，为政治、生产服务，题材多种多样，全面地反映了整风运动和生产大跃进以来的政治、经济面貌，而且又直接推动了生产大跃进和技术、文化革命。
    工农群众的文化程度虽然比较低，也遇到一些人的讽刺和反对，但他们用顽强的精神和刻苦的学习冲破了一切障碍，参加学习的人愈来愈多。已遍地开花的红专学校、业余大学、“三合一”学校都普遍地设立了哲学课。全省已经组织和正在组织学习的工农超过三百万。
    省的党政领导同志对于写作运动和全民学理论都很关怀和重视。中共江西省委书记、江西省省长邵式平同志在前些时候省委宣传部在九江专区召开的现场会议上曾就这个问题作了重要指示。他说江西对革命的文化有着巨大的贡献，毛泽东选集第一卷写的全是江西发生的事情。在中国，马克思主义、社会主义文化与广大工农群众相结合，为广大工农群众所掌握，是在江西发扬起来的。他说，现在发展社会主义和共产主义文化方面，我们江西更要力争上游。
    现在，写作运动和全民学理论的高潮正在进一步地深入发展，群众的写作和学习热情日益高涨。（附图片）
