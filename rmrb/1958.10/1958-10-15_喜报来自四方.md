    Good News Comes From All Directions
    Si Chuan: Grain and Cotton Production More Than Doubles
    Heilongjiang: Bumper Harvest of Grain and Soybeans
    Xinjiang: Cotton Yield of 100 Jin Per Mu
    Tibet: Wheat Harvest, Fat Sheep and Strong Cattle
    Si Chuan
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 14th: Sichuan Province has achieved a double leap forward in grain and cotton production this year, with both increasing by more than double compared to last year. According to the already harvested and currently being harvested crops, the total grain output of the province (including soybeans) is expected to reach 96 billion jin, an increase of 106% compared to last year's 46.5 billion jin. The average yield per mu is 1,020 jin. Cotton is being harvested intensively, and the total output is expected to reach 3.24 million dan, an increase of 131% compared to last year's 1.4 million dan.
    Sichuan Province has been one of the major grain-surplus provinces in the country for many years. The bumper grain harvest will not only make the people of the province richer but will also make a greater contribution to supporting national construction. The rapid advancement of cotton will greatly improve the cotton shortage and indicate that it has moved from a historically low-yield area to a high-yield area.
    Currently, more than 50 billion jin of grain has been collected throughout the province, and the remaining crops are also beginning to be harvested. This year, the total output of spring grain crops in Sichuan is 8.62 billion jin, early rice is 10.63 billion jin, mid-season rice is 23.32 billion jin, and corn is 7.56 billion jin, all of which have been harvested. Among the remaining crops, late rice is expected to reach about 5 billion jin; sweet potatoes are expected to reach about 130 billion jin, converted to 32.5 billion jin of raw grain; soybeans are expected to reach 880 million jin; and spring miscellaneous grains and late autumn crops are expected to reach about 7.5 billion jin. Some of the above crops have already been partially harvested, and some are just beginning to be harvested.
    With the ripening of late rice and sweet potatoes, a high tide of harvesting late rice and early digging of sweet potatoes has begun. In the northern Sichuan region, by vigorously promoting the combination of deep plowing and sweet potato digging, a lively scene of digging sweet potatoes and plowing land in unison has appeared everywhere.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, October 14th: The Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic minority areas of Sichuan Province, which have historically lacked grain, have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with an average of 750 to 1,000 jin of grain per person.
    At present, the autumn harvest in these areas has basically ended. It is estimated that the total grain output of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture can reach 700 million jin, an increase of 1.28 times compared to last year, and the yield per unit area has increased from 132 jin last year to about 300 jin. The grain output of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture can reach more than 300 million jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. Most counties in the eastern and northern parts of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have increased production by 30% to more than 130%, and it is expected that the southern counties will also be able to overfulfill this year's production increase plan. There have also been many cases of qingke barley, buckwheat, and corn with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, and potatoes with yields of over 16,000 jin per mu.
    Heilongjiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, October 14th: Heilongjiang Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain crops this year. According to the already harvested and estimated production, the total grain output of the province (including soybeans) will be 22 billion to 24 billion jin, an increase of about 50% compared to last year. The average per capita grain possession in the province is about 1,500 jin. Fuyuan, Luobei, Yichun above 48 degrees north latitude, and Tonghe, Hailun, Hulin, Huachuan, Boli, Raohe, Shangzhi, Tangyuan, and the suburbs of Harbin above 46 degrees north latitude have achieved the grain yield targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program, with an average grain yield of more than 400 jin per mu.
    This year's autumn harvest in Heilongjiang Province was completed 40 days earlier than in previous years.
    Heilongjiang Province has a small population and abundant land. The province's more than 9 million rural population has only more than 2.3 million male laborers, cultivating more than 100 million mu of land. On average, each rural laborer has to bear nearly 50 mu of cultivated land. In addition to the labor force for local industry and river embankment construction, in many places, a male laborer actually cultivates 80 to 90 mu of land. Since the great leap forward in agricultural production from last winter to this spring, the peasants of the province have been in high spirits. This year, the fertilization area of more than 100 million mu of cultivated land has expanded from 53% of the total cultivated land area last year to 91.5%, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by two and a half times compared to last year. Weeding and weeding have not been done one and a half times, but four or five times, and some have even been done seven or eight times. From last winter to this spring, peasants have been engaged in large-scale water conservancy projects on frozen soil at minus 40 degrees Celsius. The 4 million mu of paddy fields expanded this year alone exceeds the total area of paddy fields developed in the past few decades. Especially this year, when there was a drought, the peasants no longer relied on the sky for food but diverted river water to high slopes and pumped groundwater from deep wells to the surface. Therefore, this year's grain output exceeded any year in history.
    Although Heilongjiang Province has made great progress in agriculture this year, compared with the inland areas, agricultural production has not been completely turned over, and there is still great potential to be tapped. Therefore, at present, the vast number of peasants in the province are taking all measures to carry out deep plowing and water conservancy projects, responding to the call of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to do a great job in one autumn, one winter, and one spring, and use revolutionary methods to completely turn over agricultural production.
    Tibet
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 14th: Tibet has achieved a bumper harvest in both agriculture and animal husbandry this year. In recent days, large quantities of qingke barley, butter, wool, and meat have been continuously transported to towns such as Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, Heihe, and Gadaike. In the markets of these towns and the central locations bordering agricultural and pastoral areas, busy agricultural and animal product exchange activities are underway.
    This year, in the Lhasa Plain, along the Yarlung Zangbo River, and in the eastern three-river basin, the harvest of qingke barley and wheat is generally good. The Yadong Valley in the Himalayas and the Pulan Zong at the foot of the Gangdise Mountains have achieved a rare harvest in recent years. Many qingke barley ears have more than 100 grains per ear, an increase of about 30% compared to last year.
    The Lhasa Agricultural Experiment Farm has not only achieved unprecedented vegetable production, but also doubled the yield per unit area of grain crops. Good crops have grown on the newly reclaimed land in some barren mountains and canyons last year. After boldly breaking superstitions and improving farming techniques, the Heihe Branch of the Communist Party of China planted qingke barley in the northern Tibetan grasslands, where frost and ice persist throughout the year, and this year it has produced mature grains for the first time. For thousands of years, ancient legends have believed that it is impossible to grow crops in Heihe.
    On the vast Tibetan grasslands, cattle and sheep are fat and strong. Fresh beef and mutton are hung in black yak hair tents, and large amounts of butter are packed into cowhide bags. The lambs and calves born this spring have grown with smooth coats. The northern Tibetan pastoral areas, which suffered severe snow disasters from the previous winter to this spring, have recovered to the number of sheep before the disaster with the repeated relief and assistance of the Heihe Branch of the Communist Party of China.
    Although blizzards have begun to hit the northern grasslands, herders are still seizing the time to graze, and huge herds of cattle and sheep are beginning to move to winter pastures. In the southern Tibetan pastoral areas, where water and grass are abundant, herders are harvesting forage in preparation for the winter.
    Xinjiang
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 14th: 1.93 million mu of cotton fields in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are producing a large amount of cotton, and farmers of all ethnic groups are joyfully harvesting new cotton day and night. According to predictions from various places, the region can produce 1.93 million dan of ginned cotton, with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 68.26% compared to last year, and a large number of high-yielding cotton fields with 1,000 jin of seed cotton have emerged, as well as more than 1,000 mu of high-yielding cotton fields with double 1,000 jin and 3,000 jin of seed cotton.
    Since last winter, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have launched movements to build water conservancy projects, accumulate fertilizer, and carry out autumn plowing and winter irrigation on a large scale. Most cotton fields have been fertilized with 10,000 jin of basal fertilizer, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest. Strip planting, square nest planting, ditch irrigation, and infiltration irrigation methods have been widely used in cotton fields throughout the region. Many cotton fields have also achieved layered, row-by-row, and plant-by-plant topdressing and foliar fertilization; plowing and weeding three or four times, and some even up to eight or nine times, truly achieving weed-free land and loose soil.
    Another reason for this year's bumper cotton harvest in Xinjiang is that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, right-leaning conservative ideas and superstitious ideas among some cadres and the masses have been criticized, thereby liberating the minds of the masses and daring to fight against natural disasters. For example, Bachu County, located at the lower reaches of the Yarkand River, experienced a severe drought this year. Until the end of June, 80% of the county's land had not been watered once. Local peasants launched a mass movement of deep plowing and harrowing, well-digging and nest-planting, more cultivation and more weeding to fight drought, resist alkali, and conserve moisture, enabling the county's 100,000 mu of cotton fields to achieve a bumper harvest, jumping from more than 30 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year to a county with 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu.

    四  川  粮棉增产一倍多
    黑龙江  粮食大豆丰收
    新  疆  亩产皮棉一百斤
    西  藏  小麦丰收羊肥牛壮
    四　川
    据新华社成都14日电　四川省今年粮食棉花双双跃进，都比去年增产一倍以上。全省粮食（包括大豆）总产量根据已收和正在收获的情况，预计可达九百六十亿斤，比去年的四百六十五亿斤增产106％。平均亩产一千零二十斤。棉花正在紧张收摘，预计总产量可达三百二十四万担，比去年的一百四十万担增产131％。
    四川省连年来都是全国主要余粮省份之一，粮食大丰收不但将使全省人民生活更加富裕，而且也将对支援国家建设作出更大的贡献。棉花的快步前进更将大大改善缺棉情况，并且表明已经由历史上的低产区向高产区迈进。
    目前，全省有五百多亿斤粮食已经到手，其余作物也正在开始收获。今年四川小春粮食作物总产量八十六点二亿斤，早稻一百零六点三亿斤，中稻二百三十三点二亿斤，玉米七十五点六亿斤，都已收获完毕。其余作物中，晚稻预计可达五十亿斤左右；红苕（甘薯）预计可达一千三百亿斤左右，折原粮三百二十五亿斤；大豆预计可达八点八亿斤；大春杂粮和晚秋作物预计可达七十五亿斤左右。以上作物有些已经收了一部分，有些正开始收获。
    随着晚稻、红苕成熟，一个抢收晚稻、早挖红苕的高潮已经开始。川北地区通过大力推广深翻地与挖苕相结合，到处出现了挖苕翻地齐头前进的热烈场面。
    据新华社成都14日电　历来缺粮的四川省藏、彝等少数民族地区今年获得空前大丰收，平均每人粮食可达七百五十斤到一千斤。
    目前这些地区的秋收工作已经基本结束，预计凉山彝族自治州粮食总产量可达七亿斤，比去年增产一点二八倍，单位面积产量从去年的一百三十二斤增加到三百斤左右；阿坝藏族自治州粮食产量可达三亿多斤，比去年增产百分之五十以上；甘孜藏族自治州东部、北部各县大部增产百分之三十到百分之一百三十多，南部各县预计也都能超额完成今年增产计划。各地还出现了不少亩产千斤以上的青稞、荞麦和玉米，洋芋有亩产达到一万六千多斤的。
    黑龙江
    据新华社哈尔滨14日电　黑龙江省今年粮食作物空前大丰收，根据已收打和估产全省粮食总产量（包括大豆）将有二百二十亿斤到二百四十亿斤，比去年增加50％左右。全省每人平均占有粮食一千五百斤左右。北纬四十八度以上的抚远、萝北、伊春以及北纬四十六度左右的通河、海伦、虎林、桦川、勃利、饶河、尚志、汤原、哈尔滨市郊区等十二个县、市实现了全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产指标，平均谷物亩产四百斤以上。
    今年黑龙江省秋收比往年提前四十天完成。
    黑龙江省人少地多，全省九百多万农村人口只有二百三十多万男劳动力，耕种一亿多亩土地，平均每个农村劳动力要担负近五十亩耕地，除去办地方工业、修江堤的劳动力外，有许多地方，一个男劳动力实际耕作的土地达八、九十亩。从去冬今春农业生产大跃进以来，全省农民干劲冲天，今年一亿多亩耕地，施肥面积已由去年占总耕地面积53％扩大到91.5％，施肥数量更比去年增加了两倍半。中耕除草已经不是一遍半，而是四遍五遍，有的多到七、八遍。在去冬今春，农民在摄氏零下四十度的冻土上大搞水利工程，光是今年一年扩大的四百万亩水田，就超过了过去几十年来发展水田面积的总和。特别是今年遇到干旱，农民再不是靠天吃饭，而是把河水引上高坡，把地下的水打深井吸到地面。所以今年粮食的产量超过了历史上的任何一年。
    黑龙江省尽管今年农业大大前进了一步，但是和关内地区比较，农业生产还没有彻底翻身，还有很大潜力可挖。因此，目前全省广大农民正在采取一切办法大搞深翻地和兴修水利工程，响应中共黑龙江省委的号召，要大干一秋一冬一春，用革命的办法使农业生产来个彻底大翻身。
    西　藏
    新华社拉萨14日电　西藏高原今年农牧业双丰收。这几天来，大批的青稞、酥油、羊毛和肉类正源源运到拉萨、日喀则、昌都、黑河、噶大克等城镇。在这些城镇的市场上，以及农牧区接壤的中心地点，正进行着繁忙的农牧产品交换活动。
    今年，在拉萨平原，雅鲁藏布江两岸，东部三江流域，青稞和小麦的收成普遍良好。喜马拉雅山区的亚东河谷和冈底斯山脚下的普兰宗获得了近几年来少有的丰收。很多青稞穗每支结粒一百颗以上，比去年增产三成左右。
    拉萨农业试验场不仅蔬菜空前丰产，粮食作物单位面积产量也整整翻了一番。一些荒芜的山岭和峡谷地带，在去年新开垦的土地上长出了好庄稼。在大胆破除迷信，改进耕作技术以后，中共黑河分工委在藏北草原上四季冰霜不断的地区试种的青稞，今年第一次结粒成熟。千百年来的古老传说，都认为黑河种庄稼是不可能的。
    在辽阔的西藏草原上，牛羊肥壮。黑色的牛毛帐蓬里挂起了新鲜的牛羊肉，大量的酥油被装进牛皮包。今春下地的羊羔和牛犊长得毛色光滑。前冬去春遭受大雪灾的藏北牧区，在中共黑河分工委一再救济和帮助下，羊只已恢复到灾前的头数。
    目前虽然暴风雪已开始袭击北方草原，但牧民们仍抓紧时间游牧，庞大的牛羊群开始向过冬的牧场移动。在水草丰美的藏南牧区，牧民们正在收割牧草，准备过冬。
    新　疆
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　新疆维吾尔自治区一百九十三万亩棉田大量吐絮，各族农民正怀着丰收的喜悦昼夜抢收新棉。据各地预测，全区可产皮棉一百九十三万担，平均亩产皮棉一百斤，比去年提高68.26％，并涌现出大批千斤籽棉丰产田，和一千余亩双千斤、三千斤籽棉的高额丰产田。
    去冬以来，新疆各族人民在各级党委的领导下展开了大兴水利、积肥和大搞秋耕冬灌等运动，绝大部分棉田施基肥达一万斤，为今年的丰产打下了基础。全区棉田普遍采用了条播、方形窝播、沟灌、浸润灌溉等方法。许多棉田还做到了分层、分行、分株追肥和根外施肥；中耕、锄草三、四次，有的甚至达八、九次，真正作到了地无杂草、土地松软。
    新疆今年棉花大丰收的另一个原因，是在各级党委的领导下，批判了某些干部和群众中的右倾保守思想和迷信思想，从而使广大群众思想得到了解放，敢于向自然灾害进行不断的搏斗。如位于叶尔羌河最下游的巴楚县，今年曾发生了严重的旱象，直至6月底全县还有80％的土地没有浇过一次水。当地农民展开了全民性的深耕耙磨、打井窝播，多中耕、多锄草等抗旱、抗碱和保墒运动，使全县十万亩棉田获得了大丰收，由去年亩产三十多斤皮棉一跃成为百斤皮棉县。
