Vigorously Launch Mass Movements on the Industrial Front

On the steel front, the broad masses have already been mobilized. However, nationwide, in some places and in some enterprises, the work of mobilizing the masses has not been done well. Mass meetings have not been held, and the tasks, reasons, and methods have not been clearly explained to the masses, nor have debates been launched among the masses. Even now, some of our comrades are unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in the industrial sector. They describe engaging in mass movements on the industrial front as "irregular," disparaging it as "rural work style" and "guerrilla habits." This is clearly incorrect.

—Excerpt from an important talk given by Comrade Mao Zedong to Xinhua News Agency reporters in September

    在工业战线上大搞群众运动
    在钢铁战线上，广大群众已经发动起来了。但是就全国来说，有一些地方，有一些企业，对于发动群众的工作还没有做好，没有开群众大会，没有将任务、理由和方法，向群众讲得清清楚楚，并在群众中展开辩论。到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是“不正规”，贬之为“农村作风”、“游击习气”。这显然是不对的。
