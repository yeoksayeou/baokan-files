Xinhua News Agency, New York: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the disarmament issue on the 16th and 17th. Representatives of many countries stated in their speeches that the United Nations should promote an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

	In the first speech at the morning meeting on the 16th, the representative of the Romanian People's Republic, Mr. Burkan, accused the US representative, Mr. Lodge, of attempting to belittle the role of the General Assembly in the issue of disarmament by opposing the General Assembly's discussion of the substance of disarmament. He emphasized the importance of ceasing nuclear weapons tests. He said: Opposing the cessation of nuclear weapons testing is equivalent to opposing disarmament. Refusing to immediately stop nuclear weapons tests will make the disarmament issue more difficult to resolve, because this will increase the number of countries possessing nuclear weapons. He also pointed out that arming the West German armed forces with atomic weapons is particularly dangerous.
	The Romanian representative expressed full support for the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals.
	The representative of Ceylon, Mr. Subasinghe, emphasized that the disarmament issue is a very urgent one, and delaying its resolution will make the problem more complicated. He opposed the West's signing of various military treaties around the world and establishing military bases tens of thousands of miles away from their own countries.
	He said that Ceylon advocates an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing.
	The Greek representative, Mr. Palamas, expressed the hope that an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons testing could be reached soon. He also expressed his agreement with the basic idea of ​​the Soviet proposal to reduce the military budgets of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France.
	The Thai representative spoke at the meeting in support of the position taken by the United States on the disarmament issue.
	At the afternoon meeting on the 16th, the Swedish Foreign Minister, Mr. Unden, said that the Swedish delegation believes that a special proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing must be passed, rather than including this issue in a "general" resolution.
	The Iranian representative, Mr. Abdo, advocated that the United Nations General Assembly call on the participants of the upcoming Geneva conference to do everything possible to reach an agreement to stop testing.
	The Liberian representative emphasized that the current issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing is the key to solving the entire disarmament issue. He called for an agreement on this issue based on compromise, which should take into account the views of all parties as much as possible.
	The morning meeting on the 17th continued to discuss the disarmament issue. Representatives from Ghana and India spoke at the meeting.
	The representative of Ghana, Mr. Ajay, the Ghanaian Minister of Labor and Cooperatives, pointed out that the people and government of Ghana are very concerned about a reasonable solution to the disarmament issue. He said that nuclear weapons testing must be stopped.
	The head of the Indian delegation, Mr. Menon, then made a long speech. He criticized the arguments that the Western representatives attempted to use to justify their refusal to unconditionally stop nuclear weapons tests. The Western representatives said that stopping the tests would not change anything in essence, because the production of nuclear weapons could continue without testing. Mr. Menon said that if this is the case, why do those who hold this view disagree with stopping the tests?
	Some people insist that testing is necessary to improve the so-called "clean bomb." The Indian representative pointed out on this point that to him, "clean bomb" does not sound more pleasant than "clean death."
	Mr. Menon pointed out that stopping nuclear weapons testing would have a great impact on the resolution of all other disarmament issues. He said that the Indian government advocates stopping nuclear weapons testing, rather than the "suspension" of nuclear weapons testing as suggested in the Western countries' proposals, because suspension means that it can be resumed. He said that the United Nations General Assembly should pass a separate resolution calling for a stop to nuclear weapons testing.
	Speaking of other aspects of the disarmament issue, Mr. Menon said that the Indian delegation supports the Soviet proposal to reduce the military budgets of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
	At the afternoon meeting on the 18th, the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr. Aiken, submitted his own proposal to the committee, suggesting the establishment of a special committee to "study the dangers inherent in the wider proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to recommend that the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly take appropriate measures to prevent this danger."
	Mr. Aiken said that Ireland welcomes the suspension and eventual cessation of nuclear weapons testing.
	The representative of the Polish People's Republic, Mr. Winiewicz, said that there is no reason to continue the current arms race, and we hope that the United Nations can finally play a decisive role in resolving the disarmament issue. The Polish representative supports the Soviet Union's disarmament proposals and calls on all countries that do not yet possess the latest weapons not to equip their armies with these weapons.
	Next, the Soviet representative, Mr. Zorin, made a responsive speech. He said that he could not agree with the statement made by the Swedish Foreign Minister in his speech yesterday: it seems that the difference between the requirement of "stopping" the test in the Soviet proposal and the requirement of "suspending" the test in the American proposal is only a difference in "pure wording," because according to the Swedish delegation, the two proposals seem to be for the same purpose—stopping nuclear weapons testing. Mr. Zorin said that obviously, the Swedish Foreign Minister is treating the ideal as reality. The word "suspension" means a temporary measure. It reflects the position of the United States and Britain. Representatives from the United States and Britain openly stated that they are only willing to temporarily suspend the test for one year. Mr. Zorin emphasized that it is clear that this is not a dispute over wording, but a dispute over politics.
	The Soviet representative said that as for the Swedish proposal to change the word "suspension" to "stop" in the American proposal, the Soviet delegation welcomes it.
	The representatives of the United States and Britain tried to defend their countries' policies, and the Soviet representative immediately made a powerful rebuttal to them.
	The American representative, Mr. James Barrie, pretended to be puzzled and said that the American delegation does not know what else to say to convince the Soviet Union that the United States is "sincerely" hoping to stop nuclear testing. The Soviet representative, Mr. Zorin, said that it is very simple to do this, just write "stop" testing instead of "suspend" in the American proposal.
	The British representative, Mr. Anthony Moore, read a passage from the statement by the head of the British delegation, Mr. Noble, which mentioned recommending stopping nuclear weapons testing for one year, and then extending it year by year, which according to him is equivalent to "stopping."
	When Mr. Zorin responded to the British representative's statement, he reminded everyone to pay attention to the fact that the difference between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain on this issue is that we advocate unconditionally stopping the test, while Britain and the United States attach a series of conditions to it. The afternoon meeting ended here, and the next meeting is scheduled to be held on October 20.

    苏罗波印等国代表在联大政委会发言
    齐声谴责美英阻挠停止核试验
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在16日和17日继续讨论裁军问题，许多国家的代表在发言中都主张联合国应促使核武器试验立即停止。
    在16日上午会议上第一个发言的是罗马尼亚人民共和国代表布鲁坎。他指责美国代表洛奇企图用反对大会讨论裁军问题的实质的方法来贬低大会在裁军问题上的作用。并且强调指出了停止试验核武器的重要性。他说：反对停止试验核武器就等于反对裁军。拒绝立即停止试验核武器将使裁军问题更难解决，因为这样一来拥有核武器的国家就会增加。他还指出，用原子武器装备西德武装部队特别危险。
    罗马尼亚代表表示完全支持苏联的裁军建议。
    锡兰代表苏巴辛格着重指出，裁军问题是一个十分迫切的问题，拖延解决会使这个问题更加复杂。他反对西方在全世界签订各种军事条约和在离自己的国家十万八千里的地方建立军事基地。
    他说，锡兰主张立即停止试验核武器。
    希腊代表帕拉马斯表示希望，很快就能达成关于停止试验核武器的协定。他还表示同意苏联关于缩减苏联、美国、英国和法国的军事预算的提案的基本思想。
    泰国代表在会上发言支持美国在裁军问题上所采取的立场。
    在16日下午会议上，瑞典外交大臣恩顿说，瑞典代表团认为，必须通过一项停止试验核武器的专门提案，而不把这个问题包括到某一个“总的”决议中。
    伊朗代表阿卜杜主张联合国大会呼吁即将举行的日内瓦会议的参加者尽一切力量达成停止试验的协定。
    利比里亚代表着重说，目前停止试验核武器的问题是解决整个裁军问题的关键，他呼吁在妥协的基础上就这个问题谋求协议，这个妥协应尽可能地考虑到各方面的观点。
    17日上午会议继续讨论裁军问题。在会上发言的有加纳和印度代表。
    加纳代表、加纳劳工和合作社部长阿杰伊指出，加纳的人民和政府十分关心裁军问题的合理解决。他说，必须停止核武器试验。
    印度代表团团长梅农接着作了长篇发言。他批评了西方代表企图用来为他们拒绝无条件停止核武器试验的行动辩护的论据。西方代表说，停止试验实质上不能改变什么，因为核武器的生产无须试验也可以继续进行。梅农说，既然如此，为什么持有这种观点的人不同意停止试验呢？
    有人硬说，为了改进所谓“干净的炸弹”，试验是必需的。印度代表就这点指出，在他听起来，“干净炸弹”并不比“干脆死亡”来得悦耳。
    梅农指出，停止核武器试验会对其他一切裁军问题的解决起很大影响。他说，印度政府正是主张停止试验核武器，而不是像西方国家提案中所建议的“暂停”试验核武器，因为暂停就意味着可以恢复。他说，联合国大会应该单独通过一项决议，号召停止试验核武器。
    在谈到裁军问题的其他方面时，梅农表示，印度代表团赞成苏联提出的关于削减美国、苏联、英国和法国军事预算的建议。
    在18日下午会议上，爱尔兰外交部长埃肯向委员会提出了自己的提案，建议成立一个专门委员会来“研究更广泛的散布核武器所蕴藏的危险性，并建议联合国大会第十四届会议采取应有的措施来防止这种危险性”。
    埃肯说，爱尔兰欢迎暂停和最后停止核武器试验。
    波兰人民共和国代表维尼维奇说，没有任何理由继续进行目前的军备竞赛，我们希望联合国终于能够在解决裁军问题上起决定性作用。波兰代表支持苏联的裁军建议，并且呼吁一切还未拥有最新型武器的国家不要用这些武器装备自己的军队。
    接着，苏联代表佐林作答复性的发言。他说，他不能同意瑞典外交大臣在昨天发言中的这样一个说法：似乎苏联提案中的要求“停止”试验和美国提案中的要求“暂停”试验只是“纯粹措词”方面的差别，因为据瑞典代表团看来，两个提案似乎都是为了同一个目的——停止核武器试验。佐林说，显然，瑞典外交大臣把理想当成现实了。“暂停”这个字意味着是一个暂时性的措施。它反映了美国和英国的立场。美英两国代表公开说他们只愿意暂时停止试验一年。佐林着重说，可见，这里并不是措词上的争执，而是政治上的争执。
    苏联代表说，至于瑞典提议在美国提案中把“暂停”这个字换成为“停止”这个字，苏联代表团是表示欢迎的。
    美英两国代表企图为他们国家的政策辩护，苏联代表立即对他们进行了有力的驳斥。
    美国代表詹姆斯·巴利装着困惑不解的样子说，美国代表团不知道还能用什么话来说服苏联相信美国是“真心诚意”地希望停止核试验的。苏联代表佐林说，要做到这点很简单，只要在美国提案中写上“停止”试验而不是“暂停”就行了。
    英国代表安东尼·穆尔宣读了英国代表团团长诺布耳声明中的一段，其中谈到建议停止核武器试验一年，然后再逐年顺延，据他说这样做就等于是“停止”。
    佐林回答英国代表这种说法的时候提醒大家注意说，苏联同美英两国之间在这个问题上的分歧在于，我们主张无条件地停止试验，而英美两国却对它加上了一系列条件。下午会议到此结束，下次会议定于10月20日举行。
