    Half-Month Agricultural Situation
    "Autumn Equinox" (September 23rd) - "Cold Dew" (October 9th)
    During these two weeks, the temperature gradually decreased throughout China, with a more significant drop in the northern regions. In late September, Gansu, Liaoning, most of Shanxi, and northern parts of Hebei and Shaanxi provinces experienced the first frost, following the northernmost regions like Xinjiang. This year, the first frost period in these areas generally arrived five to ten days earlier than in previous years. After receiving frost warnings, various regions launched large-scale frost prevention efforts. In Yumen and Jinta, Gansu province, cold air caused temperatures to plummet to -7 to -10 degrees Celsius, resulting in severe frost damage. Late-autumn coarse grains in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and northwestern Hebei also suffered varying degrees of frost damage. Rice in a few areas of Liaoning also experienced freezing. This cold air had little impact on regions south of the Yangtze River.
    After late September, as rural areas across the country comprehensively arranged labor, the pace of autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting began to accelerate. Before "Cold Dew," late-autumn coarse grains in the north, except for sweet potatoes, were basically harvested. Most of the rice here was also harvested. Judging from the situation in the first few days of October, the progress of cotton picking in various cotton-producing areas also greatly accelerated. The progress of deep plowing in the main winter wheat areas also improved, with some provinces and cities completing more than 50% of their autumn plowing tasks by early October. By early October, provinces like Shaanxi, Gansu, Hebei, and Shanxi had completed more than half of their wheat planting tasks. Counties in these provinces with faster autumn sowing progress had already finished winter wheat sowing by early October. Drought reappeared during the autumn sowing season this year, but the scope was small and the impact was not significant.
    Many southern regions also generally began sowing and raising seedlings for rapeseed during these two weeks, and a few regions also began planting wheat.
    Before "Cold Dew," single-season late rice in southern regions had matured, and some began harvesting. Many production units made early arrangements for labor to harvest late rice. Liling, Hunan, had already deployed manpower and prepared harvesting tools for the rush harvest of late rice. Double-season late rice in southern regions also generally entered the heading stage during this period, with some beginning to grain fill. Most regions' management of double-season late rice fields had entered the stage of preventing late-stage lodging. Many areas in Guangdong are carrying out work to prevent wind damage and lodging. In Haicheng County, Fujian, ditching and draining water in late rice fields and baking the fields began to prevent late rice lodging. Many production units here, in addition to baking fields to prevent lodging, also adopted methods such as adding soil, adding sand, and building racks and pulling ropes to prevent rice lodging.

    半月农情
    “秋分”（9月23日）——“寒露”（10月9日）
    在这半个月里，我国各地气温渐渐下降，北方地区下降较为显著。甘肃、辽宁、山西大部地区，河北、陕西北部地区，在9月下旬继新疆等最北地区之后发现初霜。今年这一带的初霜期一般比往年提早五到十天。各地在接到霜冻预报以后，都展开了大规模的防霜斗争。甘肃省玉门、金塔在冷空气侵袭下，气温降到摄氏零下七到十度，受冻较重。陕西、山西、河北西北部的晚秋杂粮也受到不同程度的霜害。辽宁少数地区的水稻也有受冻现象。这次的冷空气对长江流域以南地区影响不大。
    9月下旬以后，由于农村各地全面安排了劳力，秋收、秋翻、秋种进度开始转快。在“寒露”以前，北方地区的晚秋杂粮除甘薯外，已基本收完。这里的水稻也大部分收获完了。从10月前几天的情况看，各棉区收摘棉花的进度也大大加速了。主要冬麦区深翻地的进度同样有进展，有些省、市在10月初就完成秋耕任务50％以上。到10月上旬，陕西、甘肃、河北、山西等省种麦任务已经完成一半以上。这些省秋播进度快的各县，已在10月初结束了冬麦的播种。今年秋播期间又有旱象出现，但范围较小，影响不大。
    南方许多地区也在这半个月里较普遍地开始了油菜的播种、育苗，少数地区也开始种麦。
      “寒露”以前，南方地区的单季晚稻已经成熟，有些开始收割。许多生产单位都提早安排了收割晚稻的劳动力。湖南醴陵已为抢收晚稻调兵遣将和准备收获工具。南方地区的双季晚稻在这个阶段里也普遍抽穗，部分开始灌浆。多数地区双季晚稻田的管理已进入防止后期倒伏阶段。广东许多地区，正在进行防止风害、倒伏等工作。福建海澄县为了防止晚稻倒伏，开始了在晚稻田里挖沟排水、烤田。这里的不少生产单位，在烤田防倒伏以外还采用了培土、添沙、搭架拉绳等防止水稻倒伏的办法。
