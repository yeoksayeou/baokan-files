    To Accelerate Harvesting Work and Save Large Amounts of Expenses
    Suspended Harvesters to be Converted to Automatic Harvesters

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently held a meeting to discuss the issue of converting suspended combine harvesters into automatic combine harvesters. The meeting was attended by Ignatov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and Matskevich, Soviet Minister of Agriculture.

    Mellarshikov, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation of the CPSU Central Committee, spoke on the issue at the meeting. He pointed out that the implementation of the measure proposed by Comrade Khrushchev has great significance for the national economy. This measure enables harvesting work to be carried out at an earlier date, frees up hundreds of thousands of tractors for plowing, autumn sowing, and other agricultural work, and saves the state and collective farms a large amount of expenses.

    The participants in the meeting enthusiastically supported this important measure in their speeches.

    加速收割工作　节省大量开支
    吊挂式收获机将改为自动收获机
    苏联共产党中央委员会最近举行了一次讨论把吊挂式收获联合机改装为自动收获联合机问题的会议。出席会议的有：苏共中央书记伊格纳托夫和苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇。
    苏共中央俄罗斯联邦农业部主任梅拉尔希科夫在会上就这个问题发了言。他指出，实行赫鲁晓夫同志提出的这个措施，有着巨大的国民经济意义。这个措施使得收割工作能在更早的期限内进行，并且可以腾出几十万台拖拉机进行翻耕、秋播和其他农业工作，还可以为国家和集体农庄节约大量开支。
    会议参加者在发言中热烈支持这个重要的措施。
