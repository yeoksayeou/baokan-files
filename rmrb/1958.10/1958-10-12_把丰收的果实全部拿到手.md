Get All the Harvested Fruits Into Our Hands

The materials from the Northern Nine Provinces and Cities Autumn Agricultural Collaboration Conference held recently in Xi'an indicate that the increase in autumn crops this year will be much higher than the estimated figures announced by the state not long ago. This is another encouraging piece of news. The problem now is how to get all the harvested fruits into our hands.

Since the joint issuance of the "Emergency Notice on Grasping Autumn Harvest and Planting Work" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the autumn harvest and planting work has progressed very rapidly across the country. By the beginning of October, most of the major autumn crops had been basically harvested, except for cotton, potatoes, and late rice in the south. This is a great victory. However, only by getting all the bountiful cotton, potatoes, and late rice into our hands can we truly achieve the final victory on this year's agricultural production front. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, there are still 220 million mu of potatoes to be harvested nationwide, which can produce 210 billion jin (converted to grain); and over 150 million mu of late rice to be harvested, which can produce over 120 billion jin of rice. These two crops together total over 330 billion jin, almost equal to the total grain output of the country last year. Whether China's agricultural production can achieve a great leap forward this year, and whether the output can be doubled or even more, depends critically on whether we can successfully harvest all of these 330 billion jin of grain. After the realization of communization across the country, people's communes in many places have implemented a grain supply system or food supply system where meals are free of charge. Jiangsu and other places have even put forward the slogan of "Eat your fill and produce with full energy." How much grain can a person eat in a year if they "eat their fill"? According to experiments in various places, it is about 500 jin. The output of potatoes and late rice yet to be harvested averages 550 jin per person nationwide, meaning that the people of the whole country cannot finish eating it all in one year even if they eat their fill. As for the issue of cotton picking, it should be given great attention in all areas. Cotton is now in full bloom, and in the northern provinces, it has even fully opened its bolls. However, except for a very few areas that have picked a portion, many areas have not even started picking. This is a very serious situation. If there is autumn rain when the cotton is in full bloom, it will cause serious losses to the cotton. Calculating a loss of 10 jin of lint cotton per mu, the 90 million mu of cotton nationwide will lose 9 million dan. This figure is more than 100,000 dan more than the total cotton output of the country in 1949, which was 8.8 million dan.

Now, "Cold Dew" (October 9th) has passed, and "Frost's Descent" (October 24th) is coming soon. The weather will gradually get colder, and frost is about to arrive. Once the ground temperature drops below 8 degrees Celsius, the un-dug sweet potatoes will freeze and gradually rot; once the cotton is hit by frost, it will lose its luster and reduce its quality. The northern provinces must dig up all the sweet potatoes around "Frost's Descent". The total time for harvesting sweet potatoes and cotton is only about ten days, and all areas must urgently mobilize and concentrate their efforts.

Whether we can successfully harvest the last batch of bountiful fruits of agricultural production depends critically on whether we can vigorously launch mass movements and correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping steel on one hand and agriculture on the other." Because of the vigorous production of steel, agricultural labor is tight. As long as we vigorously launch mass movements, everyone contributes ideas, and everyone offers suggestions, labor will "descend from the sky." In Henan Province, 6 million people went to make steel and iron, but because the masses were fully mobilized, with big debates and big discussions, and because specialized teams for steel, autumn harvest, deep plowing, and wheat planting were organized, the progress of the three autumn tasks was very fast. The deep plowing task has been completed by 80%, with a total of over 60 million mu deeply plowed. Shaanxi Province has strengthened political work, and urban residents have taken action and joined the autumn harvest campaign in the suburbs; primary and secondary schools have released autumn vacations, and government cadres have also implemented a half-day Sunday holiday system. More than 40% of the cotton has already been picked. Nangong County in Hebei Province has adopted methods such as replacing the old with the young, the weak with the strong, and women replacing men, and has dug out 4,000 full-time laborers from eleven aspects, including public canteens, nurseries, government enterprises, commune-run factories, and schools, and put them into the autumn harvest and planting movement.

The facts in many areas have proven that as long as arrangements are well made, the labor problem can be completely solved. The vigorous production of steel will affect agricultural production to some extent, but this effect is not inevitably unavoidable. From the perspective of a province, the number of counties engaged in steel production is always small, and most counties do not produce steel because they do not have iron ore. According to statistics from various provinces, people engaged in steel production only account for about one-third of the total labor force, and about two-thirds are still engaged in agricultural production. Since there is still such a large basic team engaged in agricultural production, and there is "labor potential" mobilized from urban residents, government cadres, employee families, and primary and secondary school students, what is the problem with labor? As long as these laborers are well organized, like Shandong, Shanxi, and Weixian County in Hebei, on the basis of "military organization, combat action, and collective life," and implement communist-style collaboration on a county-wide or even province-wide scale, and implement "twenty to the fields," the three autumn tasks will certainly be done better than any previous year, and the harvested fruits will surely be successfully collected in their entirety.

### 把丰收的果实全部拿到手

    把丰收的果实全部拿到手
    最近在西安举行的北方九省市秋季农业协作会议的材料表明：今年我国秋季作物的增产幅度，将比不久前国家公布的估计数字还要高得多。这又是一个令人振奋的消息。现在的问题是如何把丰收的果实全部拿到手。
    自从中共中央和国务院联合发出“关于抓紧秋收秋种工作的紧急通知”以后，全国的秋收、秋种工作进展得十分迅速，到10月上旬，很多地方除棉花、薯类和南方的晚稻外，各种大秋作物多数已基本收获完毕。这是一个很大的胜利。但是，只有把丰产了的棉花、薯类和晚稻全部拿到手以后，才能真正取得今年农业生产战线上的最后胜利。据农业部统计，全国尚未收获的薯类共二亿二千万亩，可产二千一百亿斤（折粮）；尚未收获的晚稻共一亿五千多万亩，可产稻谷一千二百多亿斤。这两项作物共产三千三百多亿斤，几乎等于去年全国粮食的总产量。我国今年的农业生产能不能实现大跃进？产量能不能成倍甚至更多地增长？关键就在于能不能把这三千多亿斤粮食胜利地全部收回来。全国实现公社化以后，很多地方的人民公社实行了吃饭不要钱的粮食供给制或伙食供给制。江苏等地更提出了“放开肚皮吃饭，鼓足干劲生产”的口号。一个人“放开肚皮吃饭”一年能吃多少粮食呢？据各地实验，大约五百斤上下。而尚未收获的薯类和晚稻产量，全国人民每人平均可有五百五十斤，也即全国人民放开肚皮吃，一年也吃不完。至于棉花的采摘问题，更应引起各地的十分重视。现在棉花已经盛开，北方各省的棉花甚至已经全部吐絮。但除极少数地区采摘了一部分外，许多地区甚至还没有开摘。这是一个十分严重的情况。如果在棉花盛开的时候下一场秋雨，将使棉花遭受严重损失。以每亩损失十斤皮棉计算，全国九千万亩棉花，将损失九百万担。这个数字比1949年全国棉花总产量八百八十多万担还多十多万担。
    现在，“寒露”（10月9日）已过，很快就到“霜降”（10月24日）了。天气就要逐渐冷起来，霜冻就要降临了。地温一旦降到摄氏八度以下，没有挖起的红薯就要冻坏并逐渐腐烂；棉花一经霜打，就要失去光泽降低质量。北方各省必须在“霜降”前后，把红薯全部刨挖回来。收摘红薯、棉花的全部时间，只有十来天的工夫了，各地必须紧急动员，全力突击。
    能不能把农业生产最后一批丰产的果实胜利地收回来？关键仍然是能不能大搞群众运动和正确贯彻毛主席提出的“一手抓钢铁，一手抓农业”的方针。因为大搞钢铁，农业劳动力是紧张的。只要大搞群众运动，人人出谋，个个献策，劳动力就会“从天而降”。河南省六百万人去炼钢炼铁，可是由于充分发动了群众，大鸣大辩；由于组织了钢铁、秋收、深耕、种麦专业队，三秋工作进度很快，深耕任务已经完成80％，共深翻六千多万亩。陕西省加强政治工作，城市居民已经行动起来，投入郊区三秋突击运动中；中小学放了秋假，机关干部也已实行了星期日半天休假制，棉花已经采摘40％以上。河北省南宫县采取老换壮、弱替强、女顶男等办法，从公共食堂、托儿所、机关企业、社办工厂、学校等十一个方面挖掘出四千个整劳动力，投入了秋收、秋种运动。
    许多地区的事实都已证明：只要安排得好，劳动力的问题是完全可以解决的。大搞钢铁会在一定程度上影响农业生产，但这种影响并不是注定不可免的。从一个省的范围看，搞钢铁的县份总是少数，多数县因为没有铁矿，没有搞钢铁。据各省统计：搞钢铁的人只占劳动力总数三分之一左右，还有三分之二上下的人在进行农业生产。既然仍有这样庞大的进行农业生产的基本队伍，又有从城市居民、机关干部、职工家属、中小学生中动员出来的“劳动潜力”，劳动力还成什么问题呢？只要把这些劳动力很好地组织起来，像山东、山西以及河北威县那样，在“组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化”的基础上，实行全县、甚至全省范围的共产主义大协作，实行“二十到田”，三秋工作一定会做得比以往任何一年都好，丰收的果实一定会胜利地全部收回来。
