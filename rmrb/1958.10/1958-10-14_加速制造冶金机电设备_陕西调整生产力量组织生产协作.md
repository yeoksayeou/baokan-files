Accelerate the Manufacture of Metallurgical and Mechanical Equipment
Shaanxi Adjusts Production Forces and Organizes Production Collaboration
    (Our newspaper, Xi'an, 13th) Reporter Li Qian reports: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has recently adopted measures such as centralized leadership and comprehensive collaboration to rapidly reverse the slow pace of the province's machinery industry production.
    The Shaanxi Province machinery industry is undertaking a heavy task of manufacturing large equipment this year. However, before September, very few metallurgical and mechanical equipment were produced by various machinery factories. In addition to the shortage of raw materials, which had a certain impact on production, the main reason was that there were some problems in the planning arrangements and leadership work. First, the production plans were not arranged uniformly. At the beginning of the year, the central, provincial, and municipal industrial leadership departments directly assigned tasks to the factories, and some factories received as many as eleven tasks in a row. The various departments often did not communicate with each other when assigning tasks, and each emphasized the importance of their own tasks. As a result, the machinery factories found it difficult to distinguish the importance of the tasks. In addition to completing the central tasks, they would give priority to whoever urged them the most, resulting in the use of some important materials to produce secondary or non-urgent products when materials were insufficient. Second, the lack of a department to uniformly manage the machinery industry throughout the province also affected the timely completion of production tasks. For example, the Northwest Metal Structure Factory accepted the task of producing eighty 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces at the Northwest Regional Collaboration Conference in July. Due to the lack of unified management from above, problems such as materials, equipment, and technical data were not resolved for a long time. As a result, this factory did not produce a single blast furnace before the end of August.
    At the recent meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of various machinery factories, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made unified arrangements for production based on the spirit of centralized leadership and comprehensive collaboration. The meeting decided that the machinery factories directly under the central government should vigorously complete the task of manufacturing metallurgical and mechanical equipment for Shaanxi Province and the Northwest region, while ensuring the completion of the tasks assigned by the central government; the local machinery factories should concentrate all their efforts to ensure the completion of the task of producing metallurgical and mechanical equipment, and other relatively minor products could be appropriately postponed. The meeting required that the equipment urgently needed by the metallurgical industry in Shaanxi and the Northwest region should be basically resolved before the end of November. The Provincial Party Committee also decided that the newly established Provincial Bureau of Machinery should uniformly lead the province's machinery industry. In order to urge the factories to complete their tasks on time, the Bureau of Machinery should check production every five days and specifically organize collaboration among the various machinery factories.
    After the various machinery factories strengthened comprehensive collaboration, problems that a factory could not solve alone were resolved with the cooperation of other factories. The Northwest Metal Structure Factory was required to produce thirty 75-horsepower locomotive boilers for the Xinjiang steel industry, but the factory's equipment could only produce the shells and not the engines. In the past, it had not been put into production because it could not find a cooperative unit. Recently, the Bureau of Machinery organized the factory to collaborate with the Xin'an Hardware Factory, and these locomotive boilers will soon be produced.

### 加速制造冶金机电设备  陕西调整生产力量组织生产协作

    加速制造冶金机电设备
    陕西调整生产力量组织生产协作
    本报西安13日电　记者李茜报道：中共陕西省委最近采取集中领导、全面协作等措施，迅速扭转了全省机械工业生产缓慢的局面。
    陕西省机械工业今年承担的大型设备制造任务很重。但是，在9月以前，各机械厂生产出来的冶金、机电设备很少，除了原材料供应不足致使生产受到一定影响外，主要还是因为计划安排和领导工作方面存在一些问题。首先是生产计划安排不统一。年初时，中央和省、市各工业领导部门都直接向厂布置任务，有的工厂连续接受任务达十一次之多。各部门布置任务时又常常互不联系，都强调自己的任务重要。各机械厂因此难以分辨任务的轻重，除了必须完成中央的任务外，其他的任务，谁催得紧就先给谁生产，结果在材料不足的情况下，用一些重要材料生产了次要或不急需的产品。第二，在全省范围内没有统一管理机械工业的部门，也影响到生产任务的按期完成。例如，西北金属结构厂7月份在西北区协作会议上接受了生产八十座十三立方公尺高炉的任务。由于上面没有统一管理，材料、设备和技术资料等问题长时间没有得到解决。因此，这个厂在8月底以前连一座高炉也没有生产出来。
    中共陕西省委在最近召开的各机械厂党委书记会议上，根据集中领导、全面协作的精神对生产进行了统一安排。会上决定：中央所属各机械厂，在保证完成中央分配的任务的条件下，大力完成为陕西省和西北地区制造冶金和机电设备的任务；地方机械厂集中全力保证完成生产冶金、机电设备的任务，其他比较次要的产品可以适当推迟。会议要求在11月底以前，基本上解决陕西和西北地区冶金工业所急需的设备。省委还决定由最近成立的省机械局统一领导全省的机械工业。为了督促各厂按期完成任务，机械局应每五天检查一次生产，并要具体地组织各机械厂之间的协作。
    各机械厂加强全面协作以后，一个厂单独解决不了的问题，都在别的厂的配合下解决了。西北金属结构厂要为新疆钢铁工业生产七十五马力的锅驼机三十台，但是这个厂的设备只能生产壳体，不能生产引擎。过去由于找不到协作单位，一直没有投入生产。最近机械局组织这个厂同新安五金厂协作，这些锅驼机很快就可以生产出来。
