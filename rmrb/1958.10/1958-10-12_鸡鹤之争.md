    The Chicken and Crane Controversy
    Luo Huashan
    In this revolutionary high tide that equates to twenty years in a day, there are fewer and fewer people who openly sing a low tune or sing a contrary tune. However, building socialism is an arduous struggle, and it needs to overcome various obstacles on the road forward. In fact, the opposing sides are only now using new words to decorate themselves. The so-called "Chicken and Crane Controversy" is precisely a manifestation of this kind of antagonistic struggle.
    Everyone is striving to be upstream, striving to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. This spirit of continuous communist revolution has become a great driving force for our cause. But in opposition to this spirit, some people are content to live in the middle reaches, and their slogan is: "Neither be a crane among chickens, nor a chicken among cranes."
    In political struggles, there is the so-called "middle road," in ideological struggles, there is the so-called "middle thought," and now in building socialism, there is the so-called "middle reaches line." It can be seen that the philosophy of "the doctrine of the mean" still has its market and needs to be seriously criticized.
    The essence of "middle reaches thought" is right-leaning conservatism and individualism, which is the common conclusion reached by many places after debate. "Dare not think of the upper reaches, dare not be in the lower reaches"; "The upper reaches are too hard, the lower reaches get spanked"; "Not seeking merit, but seeking no fault"; "Let the wind and waves rise, sit steady in the fishing boat," even to the point of "Being a monk for a day, striking the bell for a day." It can be seen that the right-leaning thought of being content with the middle reaches is completely contrary to the spirit of the General Line, and its love of ease and fear of hardship, and its worrying about personal gains and losses, is precisely the true color of individualism.
    The methodology of "middle reaches thought" is immutability and sophistry. Being content with the middle reaches will inevitably tend towards the lower reaches, and not being a crane among chickens will inevitably be a chicken among cranes. The reason is that the situation is constantly changing, and the revolution is constantly developing. Yesterday, democrats were the middle force, but today they have become the object of revolution. Some people think that being in the middle reaches, better than the bottom but not as good as the top, they feel at ease; believing that not everyone can be advanced, and that the middle-of-the-roaders are always the majority at any time, they are content with this. However, the so-called upper and lower reaches are relative, not immutable; the majority and the minority will also change in the course of the movement. The development of things is always like this: the middle level is constantly raised to the advanced level, so the original middle becomes backward, and the majority becomes the minority. If you respond to all changes with immutability, catch up with the leap forward with slow progress, and compare conservatism with advancement, is it possible not to fall behind? Not everyone can be number one, but everyone should strive to be number one. Today, the promoters are undoubtedly the majority, and the promoters of retreat who are content with the middle reaches (in essence, content with the lower reaches) are the minority. People in the middle reaches should not be regarded as being content with the middle reaches, and many of them are striving to be in the upper reaches. It is a completely different matter if someone is in second place in a competition, or even falls behind.
    The theory of "middle reaches thought" is idealism or vulgar materialism, denying subjective initiative, seeing things but not people, and not believing in the masses. Such as the so-called poor conditions, can not strive to be upstream; the situation is special, can only be low-speed; production has reached the top, the potential has been exhausted, can not leap forward, and so on. They believe that people are powerless in the face of nature, lose heart when they fail, retreat when they encounter difficulties, and like a clay bodhisattva crossing the river, they only seek self-preservation.
    Therefore, in the final analysis, the chicken and crane controversy is still a struggle between the advanced and the backward, a struggle between striving for the upper reaches and being content with the lower reaches. If you don't be a crane among chickens, you will be a chicken among cranes. There is no other choice between chickens and cranes.

    鸡鹤之争
    罗华山
    在这一天等于二十年的革命高潮中，公开唱低调、唱反调的人，是越来越少了。但是，建设社会主义是一场艰巨的斗争，它需要克服前进路上的多种障碍。事实上，对立面只是现在用新的言词修饰起来了而已。所谓“鸡鹤之争”，正是这种对立斗争的一个表现。
    人人都在力争上游，力求多快好省地建设社会主义，这种共产主义的不断革命的精神，成了我们事业的伟大推动力。但是同这种精神相对立，有些人却甘居中游，他们的口号是：“既不做鸡中鹤，也不做鹤中鸡。”
    在政治斗争中有所谓“中间道路”，在思想斗争中有所谓“中间思想”，而今建设社会主义又有所谓“中游路线”。可见“中庸之道”的处世哲学，还是有它的市场的，有必要加以认真批判。
    “中游思想”的实质是右倾保守和个人主义，这是许多地方经过辩论后得出的共同结论。“上游不敢想，下游不敢当”；“上游太辛苦，下游打屁股”；“不求有功，但求无过”；“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船”，以至“作一天和尚撞一天钟。”可见甘居中游的右倾思想，完全与总路线精神背道而驰，而其好逸恶劳，患得患失，正是个人主义的本色。
    “中游思想”的方法论是不变论、诡辩论。甘居中游必然趋向下游，不做鸡中鹤必然要做鹤中鸡。原因是形势不断变化，革命不断发展。昨天，民主主义者是中间力量，今天却成为革命对象。有人以为身居中游，比上不足，比下有余，因而心安理得；认为不可能人人都当先进，任何时候中间派总是多数派，因而安之若素。但是所谓上游、下游，是比较来说的，并不是不变的；多数、少数，在运动过程中也要发生变化。事情的发展总是这样：中间水平不断提高为先进水平，于是原来的中间成了落后，多数成了少数。若以不变应万变，以缓进赶跃进，以保守比先进，想不落后可能吗？不能人人当第一，但是应当人人争第一。今天促进派无疑是多数，甘居中游（实质上就是甘居下游）的促退派是少数。不能把处于中游的人，一律看作是甘居中游者，他们中有许多人都在力争上游。有的人比赛结果，屈居第二，以至落了后，这完全是另外一回事。
    “中游思想”的理论是唯心论或庸俗唯物论，否认主观能动性，见物不见人，不相信群众。诸如所谓条件不好，不能争上游；情况特殊，只能低速度；生产已到顶，潜力已挖尽，不能再跃进，等等。他们认为人们在自然面前无能为力，遇败而馁，知难而退，泥菩萨过江，但求自保足矣。
    因此归根到底，鸡鹤之争仍然是先进与落后之争，是力争上游与甘居下游之争。不做鸡中鹤，便做鹤中鸡，鸡鹤之间是没有别的选择的。
