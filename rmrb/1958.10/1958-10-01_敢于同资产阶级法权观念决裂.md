Daring to Break with Bourgeois Right Ideologies
Yu Cun

A few days ago, a county party secretary and I went to the countryside to understand the masses' reaction to the establishment of people's communes. After listening to the reports of the commune cadres, the county party secretary asked: "If the commune takes care of food and medical treatment, will some people with strong labor power and few children feel they are at a disadvantage? When several cooperatives merge into one commune, will anyone feel they are at a disadvantage because their cooperative has more accumulated wealth?" The commune cadres, who were studying "On Contradiction," used the principles of dialectics to answer the county party secretary's questions: "Everything is changing. Those who are strong laborers now will grow old in the future; those who are single now will have many children in the future; the children raised by the commune now will soon become young people with strong labor power. Our commune has more accumulated wealth than Commune A, but Commune B has more than us. Besides, when production develops greatly in the future, what will a little bit of accumulation count for?"

This is indeed a brilliant answer. This answer not only briefly and effectively dispels some people's doubts about "whether joining the people's commune is a disadvantage," but also tells us that today's peasants are no longer the peasants of the small-scale farming era, nor the peasants of the early stage of cooperativization, but peasants with a certain degree of communist consciousness, who dare to break with the concept of bourgeois right. Precisely because of this, they are welcoming the establishment of people's communes with an impatient mood.

The reason why these peasants have such a high level of ideological awareness is the result of the Party's long-term education and the mutual enlightenment and education of people during the Great Leap Forward, and the result of the technological revolution and cultural revolution. Studying philosophy has enabled them to explain this not-so-simple problem so clearly and profoundly.

Who says peasants can't learn philosophy well? In fact, compared with some bourgeois intellectuals and dogmatists, peasants learn better and understand more correctly and profoundly.

Take "to each according to his work," for example. Under the socialist system, this is a distribution principle that is conducive to the development of productive forces and must be affirmed. However, as Marx pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program," it implies certain aspects of inequality and the preservation of the remnants of bourgeois right ideologies. Regarding this principle, peasants affirm it on the one hand, and on the other hand, when necessary and under appropriate conditions, they do not hesitate to negate it to some extent (and will completely negate it in the future). Here, they are not considering personal gains and losses, but the needs of production; they are considering not only immediate interests, but also long-term interests. Therefore, they can quickly grasp the powerful weapon of dialectics. Some bourgeois intellectuals, on the contrary, openly proposed "pay according to labor" more than a year ago, and some even expressed weariness with communist ideological education. Can these people use dialectics to solve the thought of being at a disadvantage if they join the commune? Naturally, they cannot. Because they retain the bourgeois point of view. Therefore, they can only use idealism and metaphysics to observe problems. "A crooked-mouthed monk chants the scriptures badly." This "crooked mouth" is the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and method.

Therefore, I think: those intellectuals sitting in their studies should quickly go to the workers and peasants to listen to their enlightening reports, and at the same time thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois standpoint, viewpoint, and method, and closely integrate theory with practice. Otherwise, they will go astray.

    敢于同资产阶级法权观念决裂
    于村
    前几天，我和一位县委书记下乡去了解群众对成立人民公社的反映。县委书记听了社干部汇报情况后问：“吃饭、医病由公社包，一些劳动力强、子女少的人会不会觉得吃亏呢？好些合作社并为一个公社，有没有人因为自己社的积累多而觉得吃亏呢？”正在学习“矛盾论”的社干部用辩证法的原理来答复县委书记的问题：“一切都是在变化的。现在劳动力强的人，将来是会变老的；现在是单身汉，将来是会儿女成群的；现在由公社养起来的小孩子，不久就会成为有强劳动力的青年。我们的社比甲社的积累多，但乙社的积累却比我们多；同时，将来生产大发展，现在的一点点积累，算得了什么？”
    这的确是精采的答复。这个答复，不仅简短有力地解除了某些人对“加入人民公社是否吃亏”的疑虑，同时，它还告诉我们，如今的农民已经不是小农经济时代的农民，也不是合作化初期的农民，而是具有一定的共产主义觉悟的，敢于与资产阶级法权观念决裂的农民。正是如此，他们才以急不及待的心情来迎接人民公社的成立。
    这些农民之所以具有这样高的思想觉悟水平，是党的长期教育和在大跃进当中人们彼此启发教育的结果，是技术革命、文化革命的结果，学习了哲学之后，就使他们能够如此明确和深刻地阐明这一个不算简单的问题。
    谁说农民学不好哲学呢？其实，比起某些资产阶级知识分子、教条主义者来说，农民学得比他们好，理解得比他们正确和深刻得多。
    就拿“按劳取酬”来说罢。在社会主义制度下，这是一个有利于生产力发展的分配原则，是必需肯定的，但是，正如马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中所指出的，这里面意味着某些方面的不平等，意味着资产阶级法权观念的残余的保存。对这一原则，农民一方面肯定它，另外，在必要时，在适当的条件下，又不惜在某种程度上否定它（将来还会完全否定它）。在这里，他们考虑的不是个人的得失，而是生产的需要；他们考虑的不仅是眼前的利益，而是长远的利益。因此，他们能够很快就掌握住辩证法这有力的武器。而某些资产阶级知识分子恰好相反，他们在一年多以前曾公开地提出“按酬付劳”，甚至有些人还对共产主义思想教育表示厌倦。这些人能不能用辩证法来解决怕入了公社吃亏的思想呢？自然是不能的。由于他们保留着资产阶级的观点。因此，他们就只能用唯心主义和形而上学的方法来观察问题。“歪嘴和尚念坏经”，这“歪嘴”，就是资产阶级的立场、观点和方法。
    所以，我认为：那些坐在书斋里的知识分子应该赶快到工人、农民那里去听听他们的启发报告，同时彻底清除资产阶级的立场、观点、方法，把理论和实际密切结合起来。否则，就会走入歧途了。
