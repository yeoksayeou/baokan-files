Xinhua News Agency, October 17th dispatch: According to a Polish News Agency dispatch on the 16th: Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a report at the 12th Plenary Session of the Party's Central Committee on the tasks of Party organizations at all levels in the movement to welcome the Third Congress. In his report, he announced that the Congress would be held on March 10th of next year.

Gomułka said that now, the ranks of the United Workers' Party have been consolidated. The Tenth Plenary Session ended a period in which the Party leadership had previously shown a certain tolerance for those who, consistently, either from a revisionist or a dogmatist standpoint, damaged the Party's reputation.

Gomułka pointed out that revisionism spread the greatest confusion within the Party, and the Tenth Plenary Session correctly called revisionism the greatest danger to the Party. Gomułka emphasized that the Party has created an atmosphere in which revisionism cannot continue to exist, but this does not mean that the struggle against revisionism can be considered over.

Gomułka said that the fact that our entire Party fully supports the attitude taken by the Party leadership towards the revisionist program of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia best demonstrates the Party's healthy, anti-revisionist attitude.

Speaking about the results of the review of Party members, Gomułka pointed out that this review has helped to strengthen the Party and to raise ideological, political, and moral requirements within the Party organization. He said that as a result of the review, more than 200,670 people – 15.5% of the total number of Party members and candidate members – left the Party. Among those expelled from the Party, about 14% were expelled for violating the Party line, Party discipline, and Party moral principles, or for committing certain mistakes.

Speaking about the domestic economic situation, Gomułka said that, according to estimates, the total output of socialist industry in 1958 will increase by nearly 10% compared to 1957. This year's total output of the four basic grains will be equivalent to last year's level. Due to the restoration of commodity inventories, the purchasing power of the złoty has increased. However, a comprehensive stabilization of the overall price level has not yet been achieved in the first half of this year. Speaking about the most important guidelines for the Party's preparations for the Congress, he said that they should include the implementation of the resolutions of the Eleventh Plenary Session, including the elimination of surplus personnel by the end of the year to rectify the employment problem in the national economy and to increase labor productivity by improving production processes and labor organization. The main task of urban Party organizations is to achieve better economic results in all production sectors, and he pointed out that it is necessary to reduce material consumption and promote technological progress in industry. He called for attention to investment issues and the balance of foreign trade. He also called on rural Party organizations to pay more attention to the current cooperative farms and to develop specific plans to transform them into model collective farms. He said: We should study the possibility of establishing new cooperative farms, and we should help restore cooperative farms that have been dissolved because the socialist transformation of the countryside is the only way for agricultural development.

Gomułka said that all Party organizations throughout the country should participate in the preparations for the Congress. Every Party organization should ensure that the situation of the Congress, the resolutions that the Congress will adopt, and the guidelines for the Party's tasks and policies in the coming years have an impact.

Gomułka then pointed out the need to strengthen ideological work and propaganda work at and before the Congress. He believes that first of all, the training and propaganda work in Marxist philosophy, the work of teaching and propagating dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the work of fighting against idealist reactionary ideas should be greatly strengthened. Mass propaganda and mobilization work, report meetings, discussion meetings, question-and-answer sessions – all these forms of mass work should be applied on a large scale. Central activists, important politicians, economists, and ideological front workers need to participate in this report movement, go to the Party activists, and go to the Party and non-Party masses to explain important political and ideological issues.

Gomułka emphasized that the preparations for the Congress should be guided by the spirit of proletarian internationalism. We should cultivate and strengthen Party members and the masses in accordance with this spirit. Proletarian internationalism is the basic factor in the strength of the Party. The unbreakable ties of unity that exist between our Party and other fraternal parties should be further strengthened on the basis of the declaration of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties of the twelve socialist countries.

Gomułka said that the basic principle of our foreign policy is to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp because this factor plays a decisive role in the struggle for peace and in solving the most important problems of our time.

While preparing for the convening of the Congress, we should also vigorously develop and strengthen the brotherly friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, consolidate and develop the unity of the socialist camp, and unswervingly implement the principles of proletarian internationalism. This is the solid foundation for our formulation of domestic and foreign policies.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 15th dispatch: According to broadcasts from local radio stations: This afternoon at 5:00 pm, the 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party began.

The plenary session heard a report from Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, on the tasks of Party organizations at all levels in preparing for the Congress.

The plenary session appointed a committee responsible for finalizing the draft instructions on Poland's economic development from 1959 to 1965, instructions on the Party's policy in rural areas, and opinions on revising the Party Constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 16th dispatch: According to the Polish News Agency, the 12th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party entered its second day. The meeting continued to discuss Gomułka's report on the tasks of Party organizations at all levels in welcoming the Congress movement, discuss the draft instructions on Poland's development from 1959-1965, the draft instructions on the Party's policy in rural areas, and the draft revision of the Party Constitution.

    在波兰统一工人党中央全会上
    哥穆尔卡强调反修正主义斗争
    肯定农村社会主义改造是农业唯一发展道路
    要大力加强波苏友谊巩固社会主义阵营团结
    新华社17日讯　据波兰通讯社16日讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡15日在党的中央委员会第十二次全体会议上作了关于各级党组织在迎接第三次代表大会的运动中的任务的报告。他在报告中宣布，代表大会将在明年3月10日召开。
    哥穆尔卡说，现在，统一工人党的队伍已经巩固了。十中全会结束了党的领导以前对于那些不是从修正主义的立场就是从教条主义的立场一贯地破坏党的声誉的人们所表现的某种容忍的时期。
    哥穆尔卡指出，修正主义在党内散布最大的混乱，十中全会正确地把修正主义称之为对党的最大的危险。哥穆尔卡着重说，党已经创造了一种使修正主义不能继续存在的气氛，但是这并不意味着可以认为反对修正主义的斗争已经结束了。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们全党完全支持党的领导对于南斯拉夫共产主义联盟第七次代表大会的修正主义纲领所采取的态度，这一事实最好地证明了全党的健康的、反修正主义的态度。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到审查党员的结果时指出，这次审查有助于加强党，有助于在党的组织内提高思想上、政治上和道德上的要求。他说，审查结果有二十万零六千七百多人——占党员和候补党员总数的15.5％——离开了党，在那些被开除出党的人中，约有14％是因为违犯党的路线、党的纪律和党的道德原则，或者因为犯了一定的错误。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到国内经济情况时说，根据估计数字，社会主义工业的总产量在1958年将比1957年增加将近10％。今年四种基本谷物的总产量将相当于去年的水平。由于商品库存的恢复，兹罗提的购买力有了提高。可是，在今年上半年还没有能够实现总的价格水平的全面稳定。在谈到党为代表大会的召开进行准备工作的最重要方针时，他说，其中应该包括履行十一中全会的决议，包括在年底以前消除冗员，以整顿国民经济中的就业问题和通过改善生产过程和劳动组织来提高劳动生产率的问题。城市党组织的主要任务是在一切生产部门取得较好的经济成果，他指出，必须节减物资的消耗和促进工业中技术的进展。他要求注意投资问题和对外贸易的平衡问题。他还要求农村地区党组织多注意现在的合作农场，并且制订出把它们转变为模范集体农场的具体计划。他说：我们应该研究建立新的合作农场的可能性，应该帮助恢复已经解散了的合作农场。因为农村社会主义改造是农业唯一的发展道路。
    哥穆尔卡说，全国一切党组织应当参加代表大会的筹备工作。每一个党组织都应当保证对代表大会进行情况、代表大会将通过的决议以及今后几年党的任务和政策的方针发生影响。
    哥穆尔卡接着指出在代表大会以及前加强思想工作和宣传工作的必要性。他认为首先应该大大加强马克思主义哲学方面的训练和宣传工作、教授和宣传辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的工作和向唯心主义的反动思想进行斗争的工作。群众宣传鼓动工作、报告会、讨论会、问答会——所有这一切群众工作的形式都应该大规模地加以应用。中央活动家、重要政治家、经济学家、思想战线工作者都需要参加到这个报告运动中去，到党的积极分子那里去、到党和非党群众那里去，解释政治和思想方面的重要问题。
  哥穆尔卡强调说，代表大会的准备工作应该以无产阶级国际主义精神为指导。我们应该根据这种精神培养和加强党员群众。无产阶级国际主义是党的力量的基本因素。我党和其他各国兄弟党之间存在的牢不可破的团结的联系，应该在十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言的基础上进一步密切起来。
    哥穆尔卡说，我们外交政策的基本原则是加强社会主义阵营的团结。因为这个因素在争取和平的斗争中、在解决当代最重要的问题上起着决定性的作用。
    在准备召开代表大会的同时，我们还应该大力开展发展和加强波兰和苏联的兄弟般友好关系，巩固和发展社会主义阵营的团结，始终不渝地实行无产阶级国际主义的原则。这是我们制订国内政策和外交政策的坚固基础。
    新华社华沙15日电　据此间电台广播：今天下午五时，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第十二次全体会议开始举行。
    全体会议听取了统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡关于各级党组织在筹备代表大会方面的任务的报告。
    全会指定了一个委员会，负责最后草拟关于波兰1959年到1965年经济发展的指示，关于农村地区党的政策的指示，以及修改党章的意见。
    新华社华沙16日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党第十二次中央全体会议进入第二天。会议继续讨论哥穆尔卡的关于各级党组织在迎接代表大会运动中的任务的报告，讨论1959——1965年波兰发展的指示草案、党在农村中的政策指示草案、修改党章草案。
