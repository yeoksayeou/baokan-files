Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Taipei dispatch: After repeated statements from U.S. officials that Dulles had secured Chiang Kai-shek's agreement to reduce troop deployments on Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu) during their talks in Taipei, Huang Shao-ku, the "Foreign Minister" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, admitted to reporters on the 27th that the Dulles-Chiang talks had discussed the issue of strengthening the firepower of Chiang's troops on Jinmen and the "redeployment" of Chiang's troops. At the same time, Huang Shao-ku also said that during Dulles' talks with Chiang Kai-shek, they only "touched upon the issue of enhancing the firepower of the outer islands (Chiang's troops) from a purely military standpoint and did not discuss the troop strength of (Chiang Kai-shek clique's) outer island garrisons."

Huang Shao-ku stated that "increasing firepower while correspondingly reducing manpower" is a "progressive trend" in modern military affairs, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique "will never allow" reducing the troop deployments on coastal islands "as a compromising bargaining chip."

Huang Shao-ku also revealed that before Dulles' visit to Taipei, the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command had already discussed the issue of expanding "military aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique with Chiang's military authorities.

    黄少谷承认杜蒋曾讨论沿海岛屿蒋军重新部署
    新华社28日讯　台北消息：在美国官方一再传出杜勒斯在台北会谈里已经使得蒋介石同意把金门和马祖驻军减少一部分以后，蒋介石集团“外交部长”黄少谷在27日对新闻记者承认，杜蒋会谈曾经讨论了加强金门蒋军火力和蒋军“重新部署”问题。同时，黄少谷又说，在杜勒斯同蒋介石会谈时只“曾就纯军事观点涉及增强外岛（蒋军）火力问题，并未谈及（蒋介石集团）外岛驻军员额问题”。
    黄少谷表示“增强火力而相应的减少人力”是现代军事上的“进步趋势”，蒋介石集团“决不允许”以减少沿海岛屿驻军“作为姑息的交换条件”。
    黄少谷还透露，在杜勒斯这次到台北会谈以前，侵台美军司令部就已同蒋军当局商谈过扩大对蒋介石集团的“军事援助”问题。
