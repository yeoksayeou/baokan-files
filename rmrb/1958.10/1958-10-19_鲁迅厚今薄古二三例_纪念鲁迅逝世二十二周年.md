    Two or Three Examples of Lu Xun's Emphasis on the Present and Neglect of the Past
    —Commemorating the 22nd Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
    Lin Chen

    Mr. Lu Xun had profound research on ancient Chinese culture and classical literature, and he was also a model for us in emphasizing the present and neglecting the past. Here, I will discuss how he treated his own edited ancient books and research work through a few specific examples.

    After Lu Xun returned from Japan in 1909, he began to collect lost articles of novels before the Tang Dynasty, naming it "Guxiaoshuo Gouchen" (Gleanings from Ancient Novels). At that time, he couldn't afford to print it himself, so it was put aside. Later, he could have handed it over to Beixin Bookstore for publication, but he considered that such specialized books were not needed by the general readers, so he never handed it over to Beixin for printing. In 1935, Zheng Zhenduo edited the "World Library" and sought Lu Xun's opinion, hoping to include this book in his edition. Lu Xun replied to him: "I think it is not necessary to print 'Guxiaoshuo Gouchen', because firstly, it has been abandoned for a long time, and re-organizing it will take a new effort; secondly, such books may not be read by many people, so it is better to put it aside for the time being and talk about it when I have free time in the future." In the fiercely contested era of 1935, he had other more urgent and important work, so he was unwilling to "spend a new effort" on organizing ancient books. Thus, throughout Lu Xun's life, this edited book was never finalized by him and published.

    Following "Guxiaoshuo Gouchen," Lu Xun continued to collect legendary works from the Tang and Song Dynasties. He began copying them when he was working in the Ministry of Education of the Nanjing Provisional Government. In 1927, shortly after he arrived in Guangzhou, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the "April 15th" counter-revolutionary coup in Guangzhou, and many students of Zhongda University were arrested. He himself was in a dangerous situation and could not leave quickly. Only then did he use part of his time to organize "Tang Song Chuanqi Ji" (Collection of Tang and Song Legends). At the end of the preface, there are these sentences: "Concluding the wish and knowing the happiness, Fang Xin has already sighed. Looking back at the old country but not going, playing with the flying light to the end, alas, is this also the way to be kind to my life, but it is inevitable." These words movingly expressed his mood, and he deeply sighed for not being able to engage in more positive work.

    In terms of research, Lu Xun had wanted to write a "History of Chinese Literature" for many years. For this purpose, he purchased the "Sibu Congkan" (Four Series Collection) and many other reference books, and read and translated Marxist literary theory works, "understanding the questions that the previous historians of literature said a lot about, but were still entangled with" (Preface to the San Xian Ji). He conducted long-term research and full preparation for this work, and even drafted some chapters, but he never started writing it. This was naturally partly due to the unstable environment, but mainly determined by his attitude towards research work. In a letter to Xu Guangping in November 1926, he said very clearly: "I myself think that if I write something, it may be of some small benefit to China, and it is a pity not to write; but if I study something about Chinese literature, I can probably say something that others have not seen, so it seems a pity to put it down. But I think it is better to do some useful articles, as for research, do it in my spare time."

    From these few examples, we can see Mr. Lu Xun's spirit of emphasizing the present and neglecting the past in the work of collating ancient books. In fact, books such as "Guxiaoshuo Gouchen" are very useful for researchers, and "History of Chinese Literature" is even more of a reading material needed by readers, from which one can see his many insightful opinions "that others have not seen." However, under the circumstances at that time, he believed that writing articles closely related to the current struggle and literary movement was the primary task, and everything else was secondary. Therefore, in the tense battle of close combat with the enemy, he wrote a large number of essays and neglected the ancient books he had collected in his early years.

    鲁迅厚今薄古二三例
    ——纪念鲁迅逝世二十二周年
    林辰
    鲁迅先生对我国古代文化和古典文学有精湛的研究，他也是我们在厚今薄古方面的典范。这里，就几个具体事例，来谈他如何对待自己所辑古籍和研究工作。
    鲁迅在1909年自日本归国后，就开始辑录唐以前小说逸文，定名为“古小说钩沉”，当时因自己无力刻印，一直搁着。后来，他本可以交北新书局出版，但又考虑到像这样专门的书籍非广大读者所需要，因此始终没有交北新付印。到了1935年，郑振铎编辑“世界文库”，曾征求鲁迅意见，希望将此书交他编入。鲁迅却答复他说：“古小说钩沉，我想可以不必排印，因为一则放弃已久，重行整理，又须费一番新工夫；二则此种书籍，大约未必有多少人看，不如暂且放下，待将来有闲工夫时再说。”在1935年那样斗争剧烈的年代，他还有其他更迫切更重要的工作，便不愿在整理古籍上再“费一番新工夫”。这样，终鲁迅的一生，这部辑本，始终没有经他最后定稿，出版行世。
    继“古小说钩沉”之后，鲁迅又继续辑录唐宋传奇作品。他在南京临时政府教育部供职时，便开始抄录。1927年他到广州后不久，国民党反动派在广州发动了“四一五”反革命政变，中大有许多学生被捕。他自己置身在危险的境地，又不能迅速离去。这才用部分时间整理“唐宋传奇集”。在序文的末尾有这样几句：“结愿知幸，方欣已欷。顾旧乡而不行，弄飞光于有尽，嗟夫，此亦岂所以善吾生，然而不得已也。”这几句话十分动人地抒写了他的心情，他为不能从事更有积极意义的工作而深深慨叹。
    研究方面，鲁迅多年以来，就想写一部“中国文学史”。他为此购置了“四部丛刊”和其他许多参考书，又阅读和翻译马克思主义文艺理论著作，“明白了先前的文学史家们说了一大堆，还是纠缠不清的疑问”（三闲集序言）。他为这一工作进行了长期研究和充分准备，甚至连部分章节都已拟定，但他一直没有着手编著。这自然一部分是因为环境不安，但主要的还是决定于他对研究工作的态度。1926年11月，他在给许广平的一封信里，说得很明白：“我自己想，我如写点东西，也许于中国不无小好处，不写也可惜；但如果使我研究一种关于中国文学的事，大概也可以说出一点别人没有见到的话来，所以放下也似乎可惜。但我想，或者还不如做些有益的文章，至于研究，则于余暇时。”
    从这几个事例，我们可以看出鲁迅先生在校录古籍工作中的厚今薄古精神。其实，“古小说钩沉”等书，对研究者很有用处，“中国文学史”更是读者需要的读物，从其中可以看到他的许多“别人没有见到的”精辟的意见。然而，在当时情况下，他认为写作与当前现实斗争和文艺运动密切结合的文章，是首要的工作，其他都居于次要的地位。因此，在对敌人进行短兵相接的紧张的战斗里，他写了大量杂文，而将早年所辑古籍置而不顾。
