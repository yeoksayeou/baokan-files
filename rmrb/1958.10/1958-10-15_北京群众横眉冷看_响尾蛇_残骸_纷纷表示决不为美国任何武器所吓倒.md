    北京群众横眉冷看“响尾蛇”残骸
    纷纷表示决不为美国任何武器所吓倒
    据新华社14日讯　美国侵略者指使蒋介石空军使用“响尾蛇”导弹的罪证，今天起在北京市劳动人民文化宫举行展览。
    这个展览会，是由国防部主办的。
    展览室里陈列着美国制造的“响尾蛇”导弹的部分残骸，和蒋介石空军在9月24日在温州地区上空空战中使用“响尾蛇”导弹五枚、击落我飞机一架的罪行解说图。“响尾蛇”导弹的部分残骸，是从温州地区的千石村、凤凰山、灭炉村和沙村拾到的，它是美制“响尾蛇”导弹的制导部分、爆炸部分和动力装置部分。这种导弹全长二点八公尺，全重七○点三公斤。
    这里也展出了我国防部发言人的严正声明和全国各地军民一致声讨美蒋使用导弹的滔天罪行的照片，以及全世界人民反对美帝国主义建立导弹基地的斗争的照片。它显示了六亿中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的强大的意志和力量。
    观众们在参观后纷纷表示，美帝国主义的任何武器也吓不倒中国人民，阻挡不住中国人民解放自己的领土——金门、马祖、澎湖列岛和台湾的决心。
    工人陈延豪说：“我回厂以后，一定要以更加努力生产的实际行动回答敌人，用劳动的双手拉紧敌人脖子上的绞索！”
