According to a report in the Hebei Daily, Wei County, Hebei, after rapidly completing deep plowing of 400,000 mu of wheat fields, had already finished sowing on October 8th.

This year, Wei County required all wheat fields to be deep plowed to 1.5 chi (Chinese foot), with 150,000 mu of high-yield fields deep plowed to 3 to 4 chi. Each able-bodied male and female laborer was responsible for an average of more than 3 mu of deep-plowed land, in addition to autumn harvesting and manure accumulation, making the task very heavy. The county party committee promoted the method of "Twenty To The Fields," namely: secretaries working in the fields, commune members lodging in the fields, livestock sheds in the fields, people eating in the fields, threshing grounds in the fields, tool repair shops in the fields, well digging in the fields, studying culture in the fields, learning science and technology in the fields, nurseries and children's teams in the fields, large-scale airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters in the fields, manure accumulation in the fields, material supply in the fields, doctors in the fields, militia training in the fields, cultural activities in the fields, holding wedding ceremonies in the fields, rewards and punishments in the fields, issuing and delivering newspapers in the fields, and biogas lighting in the fields, achieving remarkable results. By September 20th, "Twenty To The Fields" had been widely promoted throughout the county. Since then, the time spent by people and animals traveling back and forth has been greatly reduced, labor efficiency has been improved, and commune members have been given time to rest, basically solving the problem of insufficient labor and livestock power. Currently, more than 210,000 people eat in the fields, and according to incomplete statistics, they can work 77,909 more labor days each day, with a daily deep plowing progress of more than 36,600 mu, more than twice as fast as before. By September 30th, the county had deep plowed 400,120 mu of land.

Since this year, the county plans to plant 400,000 mu of wheat, an increase of 150,000 mu compared to last year, and the average yield per mu of wheat is required to reach 5,500 jin to 6,000 jin. Party organizations at all levels paid close attention to political and ideological work while leading farmers to ensure the quality of sowing. Some commune members in the first company of Changtun People's Commune, who had some localist ideas, believed that planting wheat was the commune's business and had little to do with them, so they did not pay attention to the quality of sowing. When sowing began on 200 mu of wheat fields, 25 mu of land had a sowing amount of less than 20 jin per mu. The commune then mobilized commune members to debate: What are the benefits of planting wheat well for the country and for individuals? Are there any disadvantages to planting wheat poorly for the country and for oneself? Through debate, their thinking was unified. They unanimously believed that planting wheat well was beneficial to both the country, the commune, and themselves, and they expressed their determination to plant wheat well. By October 4th, all 5,400 mu of wheat in the entire company had been sown, with a sowing amount of more than 36 jin per mu, and the quality of sowing was also very good.

In order to ensure the quality of sowing, the county trained 11,810 advanced rollers (sowing machine operators) in political thought, with the commune or team as the unit, including 4,590 party members and members of the Communist Youth League.

On the basis of promoting the "Twenty To The Fields" leadership method, the county also fixed responsibility areas, divided responsibility zones, and organized inspection and acceptance, so that ensuring the quality of sowing was implemented throughout the process. This year, wheat planting was uniformly divided into planting zones by the commune, and the zone was contracted to several commune and team cadres who were responsible for it until the wheat harvest. The tenth camp of the Lijiazhai Commune stipulated four standards: straight rows, level ground, uniform seeds, and full seedlings. By October 3rd, they had sown 5,025 mu, and after inspection by the brigade headquarters, most of the wheat fields were of good quality and were issued acceptance certificates.

### 推行“二十到田”开展鸣放辩论　分片负责包干  威县提前完成深翻种麦计划

    推行“二十到田”开展鸣放辩论　分片负责包干
    威县提前完成深翻种麦计划
    据河北日报消息　河北威县在迅速完成四十万亩麦地的深翻之后，又已经在10月8日全部播种完毕。
    威县今年的麦地，要求全部深翻一点五尺，十五万亩丰产田深翻三至四尺，每个男女整半劳动力，除了秋收、积肥等农活外，每人平均担负三亩多深翻地，任务很重。县委推广了“二十到田”，即书记办公到田，社员住宿到田，牲口棚到田，群众吃饭到田，打场到田，工具修配厂到田，打机井到田，学文化到田，学习科学技术到田，托儿所、幼儿队到田，大鸣大放大辩论大字报到田，积肥到田，物资供应到田，医生到田，民兵训练到田，文艺活动到田，举行结婚典礼到田，奖惩到田，发行送报到田，沼气照明到田的办法，取得显著成绩。到9月20日，“二十到田”已在全县普遍推广起来。从此大大减少了人畜往返时间，提高了劳动效率，又使社员有休息时间，基本解决了劳畜力不足的问题。现在到田间吃饭的二十一万多人，据不完全的统计，每天能多作七万七千九百零九个劳动日，每日深翻进度三万六千六百多亩，比以前快一倍还多。全县到9月30日深翻地四十万零一百二十亩。
    由于今年这县计划种麦四十万亩，比去年增加十五万亩，小麦平均亩产量要求达到五千五百斤到六千斤。各级党组织在领导农民保证播种质量时，十分注意政治思想工作。常屯人民公社第一连有些有本位主义思想的社员，认为种麦子是公社的事，与自己关系不大，不注意播种质量。开始播种到二百亩麦田时，就有二十五亩地每亩播种量不到二十斤。社里便发动社员辩论：把麦子种好对国家对个人有什么好处？种不好麦子对国家对自己有没有害处？通过辩论，统一了思想，一致认为把麦子种好，既对国家对公社有利，也对自己有利，纷纷表示一定要把麦子种好。到10月4日全连的五千四百亩麦子已全部播完，每亩的播种量都在三十六斤以上，播的质量也很好。
    为了保证播种质量，这县以公社或以队为单位训练了政治思想进步的一万一千八百一十名摇耧手，其中党团员就有四千五百九十人。
    这县还在推行“二十到田”领导方法的基础上，固定责任区，划分责任片，组织检查验收，使保证播种质量贯彻始终。今年种麦统一由公社划分种植区，区由社队干部若干人包干负责，一直包到麦收。李家寨公社第十营规定了行直、地平、籽匀、全苗四个标准。到10月3日，他们已播了五千零二十五亩，经大队部检查，大部分麦田质量好，都发了验收证。
