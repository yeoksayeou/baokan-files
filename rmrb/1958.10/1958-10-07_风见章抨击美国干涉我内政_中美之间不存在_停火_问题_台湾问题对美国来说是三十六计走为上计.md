Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Kazami Akira, the head of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China delegation, told Xinhua reporters today that the United States should not interfere in the Taiwan issue, because it is entirely China's internal affair.

Kazami Akira pointed out that there is no so-called "ceasefire" issue between China and the United States. He said that the current US continues to send missile units to Taiwan. This practice, even within the United States, will be recognized as the stupid behavior of lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet.

Kazami Akira said that for the Chinese people, the Taiwan issue is "Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, Peace is the Best." However, for the Americans, it is still "Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, Running Away is the Best."

Kazami Akira criticized the US plot to submit the Taiwan issue to the United Nations. He also pointed out that the Japanese people also oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's plot to submit the Taiwan issue to the United Nations. He said that more and more Japanese people realize that the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy on the Taiwan issue is wrong, and that Japan's recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and cooperation with the Chiang Kai-shek clique is detrimental to Japan. The Kishi Nobusuke government's policies will bring disaster to the Japanese people.

Kazami Akira finally stated that the National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China will further expand the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China in the future. He said that more and more Japanese people realize that the United States is not a friend of Japan, but an enemy that uses Japan. This situation is conducive to the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and he estimates that this movement will have great development in the future.

    风见章抨击美国干涉我内政
    中美之间不存在“停火”问题
    台湾问题对美国来说是三十六计走为上计
    新华社6日讯　日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团团长风见章今天接见新华社记者时说，美国不应插手台湾问题，因为它完全是中国的内政问题。
    风见章指出，中国和美国之间并不存在所谓“停火”问题。他说，现在美国继续派导弹部队到台湾去，这种做法，在美国内部也会有人认识到是搬石头砸自己脚的愚蠢行为。
    风见章说，对中国人来说，台湾问题是“三十六计，和为上计”。但是，对美国人来说，还是“三十六计，走为上计”。
    风见章抨击了美国企图把台湾问题提交联合国的阴谋。他并且指出，日本人民也反对岸信介政府把台湾问题提交联合国的阴谋。他说，愈来愈多的日本人民认识到，岸信介政府对台湾问题所采取的政策是错误的，日本承认蒋介石集团并且同蒋介石集团合作是对日本不利的，岸信介政府的政策，将给日本人民带来灾难。
    风见章最后表示，恢复日中邦交国民会议今后将进一步努力展开恢复日中邦交运动。他说，愈来愈多的日本人民认识到，美国并不是日本的朋友，而是利用日本的敌人。这种形势对恢复日中邦交运动有利，他估计这个运动今后会有很大发展。
