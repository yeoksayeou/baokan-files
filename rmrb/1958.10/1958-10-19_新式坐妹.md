    New Style of "Zuo Mei"

    "Zuo Mei" is what the Dong people call dating. For many years, Dong girls and boys have gathered at the head and tail of the village and under the drum tower every evening, strumming the pipa and singing love songs until late at night before reluctantly saying goodbye. During the day, the girls rest at home, and the boys go up the mountain to work for a while, then sleep soundly. They did this day after day, night after night. Sometimes, the boys would even carry their pipas and travel in groups to other villages to compete in "Zuo Mei."

    Since the Great Leap Forward, the Dong young men have changed. They work hard during the day and fight hard into the night by torchlight. The girls also picked up hoes and shovels and joined in labor production. When opening up wasteland, men carried and women dug, the men wanting to show off their strength and the women not wanting to be outdone. If the girls dug fast, the boys carried even more, and everyone chose a labor competition opponent. Young people all said: Labor production can also be "Zuo Mei," which is much sweeter than singing love songs. During water conservancy construction, forty-six pairs of young men and women in Linxi area "Zuo Mei" in labor and got married on the construction site. The young woman Wu Mingnv not only went to work herself on the second day of her marriage but also motivated the women of her husband's family to go to work. The young woman Yang Xianqi, after getting married on the construction site, encouraged her husband Yang Yongxian to join the "Steel Expedition Team" and go to Liuzhou to make steel production a big success. They also challenged each other, one wanting to become an agricultural model worker, and the other wanting to become a steel hero.

    Now, you can no longer see "Zuo Mei" youths who look like vagrants in the mountain villages. They compete in enthusiasm during labor, and strum the pipa and sing to their hearts' content while resting in the fields. The happy life makes even the old people envious, saying: Young people "Zuo Mei" in labor has many benefits. Li Jinting

    新式坐妹
    “坐妹”，就是侗族青年男女谈恋爱的意思。多少年来，侗族姑娘和小伙子，每当傍晚就聚会在寨头、寨尾和古楼的下面，乒乓乒乓，弹起了琵琶，唱着情歌，直到深更半夜才依依告别。白天，姑娘在家养神，小伙子上山生产一阵，就呼呼睡大觉。这样天天不断、夜夜不闲。有时，小伙子们还抱起琵琶，成群结队，翻山越岭到别的山寨去比赛“坐妹”。
    大跃进以来，侗族男青年变样了。他们白天大闹生产，晚上又点起火把苦战。姑娘们也一个个拿起锄和铲，参加劳动生产。开垦荒地时，男挑女挖，男的要逞强、女的不相让，姑娘挖得快，小伙子挑的更多，每个人都挑选劳动竞赛的对手。青年人都说：劳动生产也能“坐妹”，比唱情歌甜得多。修水利时，林溪一带有四十六对青年男女在劳动中“坐妹”，在工地上结婚。女青年吴明女在结婚的第二天，不仅自己出工，还带动夫家的妇女出工。女青年杨贤琪，在工地结婚后，就鼓励丈夫杨永贤参加“钢铁远征队”，到柳州大闹钢铁生产，还互相挑了战，一个要当农业模范，一个要当钢铁英雄。
    现在，山寨里再也看不到像流浪汉似的“坐妹”青年。他（她）们在劳动中，比赛干劲，在田头休息时弹琵琶尽情歌唱。幸福的生活连老人也羡慕地说：年轻人在劳动“坐妹”好处多。　李进挺
