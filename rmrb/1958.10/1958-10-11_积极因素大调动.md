    Great Mobilization of Positive Factors
    After studying philosophy, the Second Production Team of the White Casting Workshop in the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory analyzed the problem of poor product quality. In July, the team's scrap rate accounted for 90% of the entire workshop, which fully demonstrates that the positive factors of the team had not been mobilized. Why weren't they mobilized? Originally, the plan to catch up with and surpass England only emphasized increasing equipment, while neglecting the mobilization of human positive factors; it only considered things, while neglecting people. Connecting this to philosophical viewpoints, it means that subjective initiative was not fully utilized. In order to mobilize people's positive factors, they analyzed the team's ideological situation and found that there was disunity between teams, which affected the improvement of quality. Therefore, three Party members took the lead in ideological work to overcome the phenomenon of disunity. In this way, everyone's positive factors were mobilized, reversing the phenomenon of poor quality.

    积极因素大调动
    山西机床厂第三车间白皮件工段第二生产小组学了哲学以后，就分析了产品质量不高的问题。7月份这个小组的废品占全车间的90％，这充分说明小组的积极因素没有调动起来。为什么没有调动起来呢？原来在制定赶英国、超英国的规划中只强调了增加设备，而忽视了调动人的积极因素；只考虑了物，而忽视了人。联系哲学观点来认识，就是没有充分发挥主观能动性。为了调动人的积极因素，他们分析了小组的思想状况，检查到小组与小组之间有不团结的现象，影响了质量的提高。于是，三个党员分头做了思想工作，克服了不团结的现象，这样就把大家的积极因素调动起来了，扭转了质量不高的现象。
