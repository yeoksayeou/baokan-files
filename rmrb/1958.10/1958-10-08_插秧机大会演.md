Rice Transplanter Grand Performance
By our reporter Jiang Weicai

One afternoon in early September, the paddy fields of the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute's experimental farm were packed with farmers, students, and government officials who had come to visit, eagerly awaiting a grand performance of various rice transplanters.

At about 3 o'clock, the performance began.

The first to attract attention was the simple wooden rice transplanter from Liling County, Hunan Province. It was small and exquisite, looking like a small stool from a distance, with two bamboo shoots like slingshots hanging the seedling clip handles. The creator of the transplanter, He Jisheng, held the clip handles in both hands while operating it, like holding a pair of pliers, skillfully clipping the seedlings from the seedling box and inserting them into the field. The agile movements were like people using chopsticks to pick up food. During the performance, the audience discovered that other transplanters used seedling claws to grab seedlings, but this transplanter used bamboo strips made into seedling clips like three fingers to clip the seedlings. This was a wonderful creation. The seedling clip inserted twenty plants at a time, increasing work efficiency by eight times compared to manual transplanting, and it could control plant spacing and density, with a maximum of 300,000 holes per mu. Hunan is preparing to manufacture 5.5 million units next year for comprehensive promotion and use.

Amidst the roar of the machines, hundreds of eyes were focused on the "Nan-105" rice transplanter that was starting to operate. Lin Tiqiang, one of the founders of the transplanter, personally operated the machine for the performance. As the roller rotated, seedlings poured out of the seedling cylinder, standing upright in the field. At this time, many farmers in the audience happily said, "This is even neater than hand-transplanted seedlings. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed that this row of seedlings was transplanted by a machine." The "Nan-105" rice transplanter can transplant a minimum of 50,000 holes per mu, and it can control density and automatically adjust plant spacing, with a maximum of 100,000 holes per mu. It can transplant 25 mu per day, increasing work efficiency by about 20 times compared to manual transplanting, which has attracted great attention from visitors.

Amidst a burst of enthusiastic applause, the audience was attracted by the wonderful performance of the wooden rice transplanter created by Zhao Guocheng and two other carpenters from Zhuji County, Zhejiang. Zhao Guocheng held the pull rod in one hand and the operating rod in the other, moving his feet backwards. When the operating rod was pressed down, the machine clicked, and the seedlings were neatly inserted into the field. This rice transplanter can transplant nine holes at a time, transplanting 120,000 holes a day, increasing work efficiency by about six to eight times compared to manual transplanting, and it is suitable for the requirements of dense planting, with a maximum of 80,000 holes per mu. Not long ago, this rice transplanter surpassed the iron rice transplanter created by an engineer from the Zhejiang Agricultural Science Research Institute at the Second Zhejiang Province Rice Transplanter Competition, and received high praise.

Here, visitors also saw the performance of the "Direct Insertion Rice Transplanter" from Yuyao County, the "Red Flag No. 1 Rice Transplanter" from Jiangxi, and dozens of other rice transplanters. The performance of each rice transplanter gave every audience member great encouragement and hope. Yes, for many years people have dreamed of having a transplanting tool to replace manual transplanting. This grand aspiration can become a reality.

    插秧机大会演
    本报记者　姜韦才
    9月上旬一个下午，南京农业机械化研究所的试验农场水田周围，前来参观的农民，学生和机关干部，挤得水泄不通，兴奋地等待着一场各式水稻插秧机的大会演。
    三时许，表演开始了。
    首先引人注目的是湖南省醴陵县的木制简易插秧机，小巧玲珑，远远一看就像一条小长凳，上面插着两根像弹弓一样的竹梢吊着秧夹柄。插秧机的创造人贺继生在操作时两手握住夹柄，像拿着一把老虎钳子，熟练地从秧箱中夹起秧苗插到田里。灵巧的动作，就像人们吃饭时用筷子取菜一样。随着脚步的移动表演者身后出现了二十行秧苗，又密又匀。表演时，观众们发现别的插秧机都是用秧爪抓秧，而这台插秧机却是用竹片做成的像三个指头一样的秧夹夹秧。这是一个奇妙的创造。秧夹一次插二十棵，比用手插秧提高工效八倍，并且可以控制株距，控制密度，最密每亩可插三十万穴。湖南准备明年制造五百五十万台，全面推广使用。
                                    *
    在机器的轰鸣声中，几百只眼睛，又一齐盯住了正在开动着的“南—105”插秧机。插秧机的创始人之一林体强，亲自操作机器表演。随着滚筒的转动，一棵棵秧苗就从秧筒中倾泻出来，笔直的站在田里。这时候观众中许多农民高兴地说：“这简直比手插的还要整齐，要不是亲眼看见，怎能相信这一排秧是机器插的呢”。“南—105”插秧机每亩最少可插五万穴，而且能够控制密度，自动调整株距，最密每亩可插十万穴，一天能插二十五亩，比人工插秧提高工效二十倍左右，这受到参观者的很大注意。
                                  *
    随着一阵热烈的鼓掌声，观众们又被浙江诸暨县赵国成等三个木工创造的木制插秧机的精彩表演吸引住了。赵国成一手握着拉杆，一手握住操作杆，一面向后移动着脚步。操作杆往下一压，机器咔嚓一声，秧苗就整整齐齐地插在田里了。这部插秧机一次能插九穴，一天能插十二万穴，比用手插秧提高工效六到八倍左右，并且适合于密植的要求，最密每亩可插八万穴。这台插秧机不久前在浙江省第二次水稻插秧机评比会上，赛过了浙江农业科学研究所的一位工程师创造的铁制插秧机，并且得到很高的评价。
                                    *
    参观的人们在这里还看到余姚县“直插式插秧机”，江西“红旗一号插秧机”以及其他几十台插秧机的表演。每一台插秧机的表演，都给每一个观众以极大鼓舞和希望。是的，人们多少年来就梦想着能有一种插秧工具来代替用手插秧，这个宏愿可以变成现实了。
