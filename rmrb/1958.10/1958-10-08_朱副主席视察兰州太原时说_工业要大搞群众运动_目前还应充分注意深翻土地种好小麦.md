Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected work in Lanzhou and Taiyuan from September 25th to September 28th, extensively contacting local workers, cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and gave important instructions on various tasks.

After arriving in Lanzhou by plane from Xinjiang on the afternoon of September 25th, Vice Chairman Zhu De, in addition to listening to reports from Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, Huo Weide, Secretary of the Secretariat, Li Peifu and Ma Qingnian, Deputy Governors, and Zhang Dazhi, Commander of the Lanzhou Military Region, also received Zhang Tiezheng, Director of the Liujiaxia Engineering Bureau, Wang Jun, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Refinery, Xu Jinqiang, Director of the Lanzhou Refinery, Xia Qiugang, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory, and Guo Yimin, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant, and listened to their work reports on these units. Not long ago, when Vice Chairman Zhu De visited Lanzhou, he inspected the work of several state-owned factories such as the Lanzhou Refinery. This time, when he returned to Lanzhou, he expressed great pleasure at the great leap forward situation in these factories. Vice Chairman Zhu encouraged everyone to seize the time to speed up the progress of the project and produce more. He said that the factory could be expanded next year to produce more things. Our country is so big that there is nothing that cannot be used.

Vice Chairman Zhu was very concerned about the current steel production. He asked the comrades in these factories whether they had built steel mills and produced steel. Guo Yimin, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant, said that they would strive to produce 25,000 tons of steel this year. Vice Chairman Zhu said that in the future, you will rely on your own steelmaking to manufacture machinery and equipment. Xia Qiugang, Secretary of the Party Committee of the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory, reported that they had cooperated with local areas to manufacture 170,000 tons of iron and steel smelting equipment, and were also preparing to manufacture forging equipment. They are currently preparing to manufacture a 400 cm primary rolling mill. Vice Chairman Zhu said to Xia Qiugang, "I approve of your approach. This is a communist approach." Vice Chairman Zhu also instructed the chemical plant to strengthen cooperation with local areas. He said to Guo Yimin, "You help others, and others help you, so that you can build the factory. You should become 'hens'."

Vice Chairman Zhu paid great attention to the comprehensive utilization of factories. After inquiring in detail about the situation of the Petrochemical Machinery Factory manufacturing mechanical equipment from Xia Qiugang, he said, "You should run a multi-purpose factory, not just produce one thing. It would be good to be able to produce many things. You should produce oil refining equipment, as well as thin plates and pipes. You are the only heavy machinery factory here, and you should produce the iron and steel smelting equipment needed locally." Vice Chairman Zhu said that in the past, the idea of running a factory to supply equipment to the whole country was a capitalist design idea, not a socialist one. Our country is so big that it will never be enough to rely on one factory to supply a certain product to the whole country. Socialist construction requires that all localities have a relatively complete industrial system, producing a variety of things. Anshan Iron and Steel has a little bit of everything. In the future, specialized factories should develop into multi-purpose factories.

In the report, the heads of these factories all talked about the problem of equipment supply not keeping up. Vice Chairman Zhu encouraged everyone to have the spirit of communism when building communism. He especially emphasized self-reliance. He said, "Everything must be self-reliant. If you can do it yourself, don't rely on others. No matter what difficulties you encounter, try to find a solution yourself. Equipment manufactured by yourself comes quickly and is cheaper." He expressed pleasure that these factories were able to produce some equipment themselves.

From September 26th to 28th, Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, Jinxi Machinery Plant, Taihang Instrument Factory, Shanxi Machine Tool Plant, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, and listened to reports on industrial and agricultural production, especially steel production, from Wei Heng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Acting Governor of Shanxi Province, Wang Qian and Chi Biqing, Secretaries of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and Li Qi, First Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee. He met with officers from the Shanxi Military Region and PLA troops stationed in Taiyuan.

On the afternoon of the 26th, when Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, he was particularly concerned about how the plant manufactured metallurgical equipment and supported various parts of the country. He said that the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant is a national large factory and should undertake the major task of supporting metallurgical equipment to various parts of the country. The task this year is very heavy, and we should make major efforts to continue to tap potential, give play to the creativity of the workers, try every means to be self-reliant, and support the construction of various regions. When Vice Chairman Zhu inspected various workshops of the Jinxi Machinery Factory, he talked with many workers, encouraging everyone to go all out and create miracles.

That evening, when listening to Wei Heng and Chi Biqing's reports on the current industrial construction in Shanxi Province, especially the situation of the entire province's people fighting for steel, Vice Chairman Zhu attached great importance to the method of iron and steel making with "small, indigenous, and mass" methods. He said that this mass "small, indigenous, and mass" method of iron and steel making is very good and is part of the experience of our working people fighting against nature. We should greatly promote and popularize this experience. As long as we resolutely implement the mass line in the industrial field, believe in the masses, and rely on the masses to carry out large-scale mass movements, not only will the tasks on the steel front be completed, but the tasks in other industrial fields will also be successfully completed. Vice Chairman Zhu also instructed that when grasping industry and fighting for steel, do not relax agricultural production, and should pay full attention to deep plowing of the land and planting wheat well to lay a favorable foundation for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year.

On the 27th, Vice Chairman Zhu inspected various workshops of the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant, watched the simple machine tools made by the plant, praised the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, and emphasized the importance of the machinery industry. He said, "With steel and iron, there must also be machinery. It is one of the three major 'marshals'. Only when the mechanical 'marshal' takes charge can agricultural production be mechanized and industrial production be further developed. Therefore, it is necessary to establish its own mechanical industrial system according to local characteristics." Vice Chairman Zhu also pointed out that the development of the machinery industry can save a lot of labor and shorten working hours. People have ample time to better carry out cultural and theoretical studies, thereby greatly improving people's material and spiritual lives, gradually reducing the differences between industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and manual and mental labor, and creating favorable conditions for moving towards communism.

When Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, he paid special attention to how to increase the types of steel, and emphasized that a large enterprise like Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company has the conditions to gradually become a comprehensive joint enterprise. In addition to producing various steel products, it should also run some other industries. Vice Chairman Zhu also said that to double steel production, technical measures, leap forward plans, mutual cooperation, etc., are certainly important and indispensable conditions, but the main thing is to put politics in command and rely on the masses. With this, everything else will be easy.

On the morning of the 28th, Vice Chairman Zhu met with officers from the Shanxi Military Region and PLA troops stationed in Taiyuan and gave a speech to them. In his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that our army is a proletarian army established under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. It is a people's army with a political mind and an army that puts politics in command. When talking about the implementation of the supply system, he said, "In decades of revolutionary struggle, our army has long lived under the supply system, a life of military communism. Although there was no salary, we relied on the leadership of the Party, the support of the broad masses of the people, and the communist consciousness of all comrades. We did not want money, we did not cherish our lives, and we carried out tenacious struggles, advancing wave upon wave, and finally achieved the victory of the revolution. In recent years, the officers of the troops have been changed to a salary system. Now, compared, everyone feels that the supply system is better. The conditions for us to implement the supply system now are much better than in the past."

When talking about the current situation of the country, Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out in his speech that the people's commune has been realized throughout the country in one or two months. The development of industrial and agricultural production is progressing rapidly. We will have more grain and steel in the next year or two. What we don't have today, we will have tomorrow. With the development of production, the equipment of our army will be more modernized, coupled with the national armed forces of China's 600 million people, if imperialism wants to invade us, it will only bring about its own destruction. We are not afraid of imperialism setting fire. If a war really breaks out, imperialism will die faster, and the realization of communism in our country and the world will come faster. Vice Chairman Zhu said that in a few years, the face of our country will change greatly. If imperialism insists on fighting, we will defeat it. If there is no war, we will surpass it in production.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally instructed that 600 million people are making a leap forward, and the army is also making a leap forward. The troops should learn military technology well and improve their culture. Life should not be special. Everyone's thoughts and actions should be communist. Selfishness cannot stand in the masses. If you are separated from the collective and only fantasize about how to enjoy yourself personally, you will not achieve your goal. If you are thinking about a communist society, thinking about how everyone can live a happy life, then this kind of life will soon be realized.

During this inspection in Taiyuan, Vice Chairman Zhu met with approximately 30,000 employees and cadres, bringing great encouragement and strength to everyone. Many units and workshops held Party meetings or cadre meetings on the same day to discuss further implementing the production leap forward plan, determined to use their new leap forward achievements to answer Vice Chairman Zhu's encouragement and warm concern.

    朱副主席视察兰州太原时说
    工业要大搞群众运动
    目前还应充分注意深翻土地种好小麦
    新华社7日讯　朱德副主席在9月25日到9月28日曾到兰州和太原视察工作，同当地工人、干部和解放军官兵广泛接触，并且对各项工作作了重要指示。
    朱德副主席在9月25日下午从新疆乘飞机到达兰州以后，除了听取甘肃省委第一书记张仲良、书记处书记霍维德、副省长李培福、马青年和兰州军区司令员张达志的汇报以外，还接见了刘家峡工程局局长张铁铮，兰州炼油厂党委书记王俊、厂长徐劲强，兰州石油化工机器厂党委书记夏秋岗，兰州化工厂党委书记郭宜民等人，听取了他们关于这几个单位的工作汇报。不久前朱德副主席到兰州时，曾经检查过兰州炼油厂等几个国营工厂的工作，这一次他重到兰州时，对于这几个工厂大跃进的情况表示很高兴。朱副主席鼓励大家争取时间加快工程进度，多多生产。他说，明年可以把厂子扩大，多生产些东西，我们的国家这样大，没有用不上的东西。
    朱副主席对当前钢铁生产非常关心，他问这几个厂的同志建设炼钢厂没有，炼出钢没有。兰州化工厂党委书记郭宜民说，我们今年争取炼两万五千吨钢。朱副主席说，以后就靠你们自己炼钢制造机器设备。兰州石油化工机器厂党委书记夏秋岗汇报他们和地方大协作，已经制造了十七万吨钢铁冶炼设备，还准备制造锻压设备，目前正准备制造四百厘米初轧钢机。朱副主席对夏秋岗说，我赞成你们的作法，这是共产主义的作法。朱副主席并指示化工厂加强和地方协作。他对郭宜民说，你们帮助人家，人家帮助你们，才能把厂子建立起来，你们应该变成“母鸡”。
    朱副主席很注意工厂的综合利用问题。他详细询问了夏秋岗关于石油化工机器厂制造机械设备的情况后说，你们应当办万能厂，不要光生产一种东西，能生产多种东西就好了。你们要生产炼油设备，还要生产薄板、管子。这里只有你们一个重型机械厂，地方上需要的钢铁冶炼设备，你们就要生产。朱副主席说，过去想办一个工厂，供应全国设备，这是资本主义的设计思想，不是社会主义的。我们的国家这样大，只靠一个厂子供应全国某一种产品永远是不会够的。社会主义建设要求各地方都要有比较完整的工业体系，生产多种东西，鞍钢就什么都有一点。今后专业厂应该向万能厂发展。
    在汇报中，这几个厂的负责人都谈到设备供应赶不上的问题。朱副主席勉励大家建设共产主义就要具有共产主义的气魄，他特别强调自力更生。他说，一切都要自力更生，凡是自己能够做的，就不要依靠别人，不管什么困难，都要尽量自己设法解决。自己制造的设备来得快，又便宜。他对这几个厂子自己能够生产一些设备表示高兴。
    9月26日到28日，朱副主席在太原视察了重型机器厂、晋西机器厂、太行仪表厂、山西机床厂和太原钢铁公司，听取了中共山西省委书记处书记、山西省代省长卫恒，山西省委书记处书记王谦、池必卿和中共太原市委第一书记李琦等关于工农业生产特别是钢铁生产情况的汇报，接见了山西军区及解放军驻太原部队的军官。
    26日下午，朱副主席在视察太原重型机器厂的时候，特别关心这个厂如何制造冶金设备和支援全国各地的情形。他说，太原重型机卿厂是个全国性的大厂，应该担负起支援全国各地冶金设备的重大任务。今年的任务很重，应当作重大的努力，继续挖掘潜力，发挥职工群众的创造性，想尽办法，自力更生，并支援各地的建设。朱副主席到晋西机器厂的各个车间视察时，曾经同许多工人谈了话，勉励大家鼓足干劲，创造奇迹。
    当天晚上，朱副主席在听取卫恒和池必卿关于当前山西省工业建设特别是全省人民大战钢铁情况的汇报时，对采用“小、土、群”的办法炼铁炼钢极为重视。他说，这种群众性的“小、土、群”炼铁、炼钢的办法很好，是我国劳动人民同自然界进行斗争的经验的一部分，应当大大提倡和推广这种经验。只要在工业方面坚决贯彻群众路线，相信群众，依靠群众搞大规模的群众运动，不仅钢铁战线上的任务能够完成，其他工业方面的任务也一定能够顺利完成。朱副主席还指示在大抓工业、大战钢铁的时候，不要放松了农业生产，应充分注意深翻土地，把小麦种好，为明年农业的更大跃进打下有利的基础。
    27日，朱副主席视察了山西机床厂的各个车间，观看了这个厂制作的简易车床，赞誉工人们的革命干劲，并且强调机械工业的重要性。他说，有了钢，有了铁，还必须要有机械。它是三大“元帅”之一，机械“元帅”升了帐，才能够使农业生产机械化，才能够使工业生产进一步地发展，因此，必须根据地方特点，建立自己的机械工业体系。朱副主席还指出，机械工业的发展，能大量节约劳动力，缩短工作时间。人们有了充裕的时间，就可以更好的进行文化、理论学习，从而大大提高人们的物质生活与精神生活，逐步减少工业与农业之间、城市与乡村之间、体力与脑力劳动之间的差别，为迈向共产主义创造有利条件。
    朱副主席在视察太原钢铁公司的时候，特别注意如何增加钢的种类的问题，并且强调地指出，像太原钢铁公司这样一个大型企业，有条件逐步地办成综合性的联合企业，除了生产多种钢铁产品以外，还应当办一些其他的工业。朱副主席还说，要使钢铁产量翻一番，技术措施、跃进计划、互相协作等等，固然是重要的和不可缺少的条件，但主要的是政治挂帅和依靠群众，有了这一条，其他的一切就都好办了。
    28日上午，朱副主席接见了山西军区及解放军驻太原部队的军官，向他们讲了话。朱副主席在讲话中指出，我们的军队是在党和毛主席领导下建立起来的无产阶级的军队，是一支有政治头脑的人民军队，是政治挂帅的军队。在谈到实行供给制时，他说，在几十年的革命斗争中，我们的军队长期过的是供给制生活，过的是军事共产主义的生活，虽然没有薪水，但是我们依靠党的领导，依靠广大人民的支援，依靠全体同志的共产主义觉悟，我们不要钱，不惜生命，前仆后继地进行了顽强的斗争，终于取得了革命的胜利。近几年来，部队军官才改成薪金制，现在比较起来，大家觉得还是供给制好。我们现在来实行供给制，条件比过去要好得多了。
    朱副主席在讲话中谈到国家目前形势时指出，全国在一两个月内就实现了人民公社化。工农业生产发展一日千里。明后年我们将有更多的粮食和钢铁，我们今天没有的东西，明天就会有了。随着生产的发展，我们军队的装备将会更加现代化，再加上我国六亿人口的全民武装，帝国主义要想侵略我们只有自取灭亡。我们不怕帝国主义放火，如果真的打起来，帝国主义将死亡得更快，我国和全世界实现共产主义也会来得更快。朱副主席说，再过几年，我们国家的面貌就会大大改变了。帝国主义硬是要打，就把它打垮。不打仗，我们在生产上也要把它比垮。
    朱副主席最后指示说，六亿人民都在跃进，军队也在跃进。部队应学好军事技术，提高文化。生活不要特殊化。每个人的思想行动都应该是共产主义的。自私在群众中是站不住脚的。如果脱离集体只是幻想个人如何享受，那是达不到目的的。如果你想的是共产主义社会，想的是大家如何过幸福的生活，那末，这种生活很快就会实现。
    朱副主席这次在太原视察，同大约三万名职工、干部见了面，给大家带来了极大的鼓舞和力量，许多单位和车间当天就召开了党的会议或干部会议，讨论进一步实现生产跃进计划，决心用自己的新的跃进成就，来回答朱副主席的鼓励和亲切的关怀。
