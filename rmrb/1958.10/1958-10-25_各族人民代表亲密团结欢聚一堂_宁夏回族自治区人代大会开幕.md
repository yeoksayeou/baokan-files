Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 24th: The first session of the First People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region solemnly opened in Yinchuan City today.

A total of one hundred and eighty-five representatives attended the meeting, and thirty-five people attended as observers.

Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, who came to congratulate the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, was warmly welcomed by all the representatives when he attended today's meeting.

Also participating in the meeting were Xie Fumin, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, Yang Jingren, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, representatives from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and 19 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities including Gansu.

The congress opened with the solemn sound of the national anthem. Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, delivered the opening speech to the congress. He said that the gathering of representatives of all ethnic groups embodies the close unity of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The preparation and establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have always received the cordial care of the CPC Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. On behalf of the people of the entire region, I express my highest respect to the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to Comrade Lin Boqu, the representative of the Central Government, and the representatives of fraternal regions and fraternal ethnic groups. He said, "The establishment of the Xia Hui Autonomous Region will greatly stimulate the political enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia to build socialism, enhance the socialist awareness of the people throughout the region, powerfully promote the rapid leap forward of our socialist cause, and greatly strengthen the unity and friendship of our great family of nationalities."

At the meeting, Liu Geping, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, delivered a work report to the congress on behalf of the Preparatory Committee. He said that after liberation, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the former Ningxia Province and the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and Government, the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia completed the tasks of democratic reform and the restoration period of the national economy. Then, socialist transformations of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce were implemented, changing the ownership of the means of production, establishing new socialist relations of production, and achieving the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. At the same time, the new relationship of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation that has been established between the Han and Hui nationalities has been increasingly consolidated and developed on the socialist economic foundation, creating conditions for the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region today.

Liu Geping said: Starting in the second half of 1957, a people's rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle were carried out in the Ningxia region, achieving a great victory on the political and ideological fronts, liberating social productive forces and the thinking of all ethnic groups on an unprecedented scale, and setting off a high tide of great leaps forward in industrial and agricultural production throughout the region. He said that in the future, it is necessary to continue to realize the Ningxia Working Committee of the CPC's fighting call of "riding the wind and waves, fighting hard for three years, and changing the face of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region," and strive to complete and overfulfill the second five-year plan. In order to ensure the successful completion of future tasks, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the leadership of the Communist Party, continue to educate the people of all ethnic groups in internationalism, patriotism, and national unity, prevent and overcome localism, local nationalism, and Han chauvinism that hinder national unity, and oppose all thoughts and behaviors that are not conducive to national unity.

Next, Li Jinglin, convener of the Drafting Committee of the Organizational Regulations of the People's Congress and the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, gave an "Explanation on the Organizational Regulations of the People's Congress and the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region." Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee, gave a report to the congress on the "Report on the Implementation of the 1958 National Economic Plan and the Draft 1959 National Economic Plan of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region."

The meeting will continue tomorrow. This congress will elect the Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and members of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, the President of the Autonomous Region Higher People's Court and Intermediate People's Court, and representatives to the National People's Congress; formulate the Autonomous Region's 1959 National Economic Plan, formulate the Autonomous Region's organizational regulations, and approve the Autonomous Region's 1959 fiscal budget.
