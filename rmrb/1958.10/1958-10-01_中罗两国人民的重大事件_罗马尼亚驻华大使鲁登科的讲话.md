Comrade Vice Chairman, dear comrades and friends:

    Please allow me to express my heartfelt welcome and great excitement to the initiative put forward by various people's organizations of the People's Republic of China regarding the establishment of associations for friendship with various socialist countries.  On the eve of celebrating the great and glorious festival of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people put forward this initiative, which powerfully embodies the Chinese people's fraternal friendship and internationalist solidarity with the socialist family.  There is no doubt that this will deepen the friendship and mutual understanding between the peoples of the socialist countries.  At the same time, it will further consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and will also promote the development of world peace.

    For us, the establishment of the China-Romania Friendship Association will be a major event in the relationship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people.  It also marks a step forward in the path of developing the unbreakable friendship between our two countries and peoples.

    In the struggle to build socialism and defend peace, the Romanian and Chinese peoples have established fraternal relations of friendship and cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. This relationship is built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit for the socialist construction of our two countries, and mutual assistance, on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism; and it has developed in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and in defense of the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought.

    Our two countries, like other countries in the socialist camp, have signed trade, cultural, and scientific and technological agreements. This is conducive to the increasing amount of trade between our two countries year by year. At the same time, our two countries, through the exchange of scientific and cultural workers, art and sports groups, have enabled the people of the two countries to gain mutual understanding of their lives and work. Our two countries’ fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, like the valuable assistance the Soviet Union has given to our two peoples, has greatly promoted and accelerated socialist construction.

    The visit of the Chinese National People's Congress delegation headed by Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Peng Zhen to the Romanian People's Republic, as well as the visits to the People's Republic of China by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Romanian Workers' Party, the late Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly Dr. Petru Groza and the Romanian parliamentary delegation, the government delegation led by Comrade Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and the military delegation led by Leontin Sălăjan, have contributed and are contributing to the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Romanian and Chinese peoples.

    The Romanian people have been following the great achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction with great interest and admiration, and regard these achievements as their own. The recent Great Leap Forward achieved by the Chinese people in developing the national economy, science, technology, and culture makes us all happy.

    With fraternal friendship and proletarian internationalist feelings, the Romanian people firmly support the Chinese people in liberating their inherent territory – Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands occupied by American aggressors. The Romanian people, in many rallies held in factories and rural areas, expressed their anger at the aggressive provocations of US imperialism in the Taiwan Straits region and expressed their full sympathy and support for the Chinese people's just struggle.

    Dear comrades and friends,

    The Romanian people are proud of their friendship with the great Chinese people and are proud to be together with the Chinese people as members of the powerful and invincible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    I wish the China Association for Friendship with Socialist Countries great victories in strengthening and developing friendship with the peoples of all countries. I wish the China-Romania Friendship Association great results in its work, and at the same time we will guarantee to give care and support to the work of the China-Romania Friendship Association.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Romanian and Chinese peoples!

    Long live the great fraternal Chinese people!

    Long live the great, invincible family of peoples of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    中罗两国人民的重大事件
    罗马尼亚驻华大使鲁登科的讲话尊敬的副主席同志亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    请允许我衷心地欢迎中华人民共和国各人民团体所提出的关于建立对各社会主义国家友好协会的倡议，并表达十分兴奋的心情。在庆祝中华人民共和国伟大而光荣的节日的前夕中国人民提出这一创议，有力地体现出中国人民对社会主义大家庭兄弟般的友谊和国际主义团结的感情。毫无疑问，这将密切和加深各社会主义国家人民之间的友谊和相互了解。同时，将更加巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，并且也将促进世界和平事业的发展。
    对于我们来讲，中罗友好协会的成立，将是罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民的关系中的重大事件。这也标志着我们两个国家和人民之间的牢不可破的友谊在发展道路上前进了一步。
    在建设社会主义和保卫和平的斗争中，罗马尼亚人民和中国人民建立了政治、经济和文化方面兄弟般的友谊和合作关系。这种关系是建立在无产阶级国际主义的基础上，建立在完全平等和有利于我们两国社会主义建设以及互相帮助的基础上，建立在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上；并且在反对帝国主义的侵略和捍卫马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁的共同斗争中得到了发展。
    我们两国像社会主义阵营其他各国一样，签订了贸易、文化、科学技术协定。这有利于我们两国贸易的数额与年俱增。同时，我们两国通过互派科学和文化工作者、艺术和体育团体，使两国人民对于其生活和劳动取得了互相的了解。我们两国兄弟般的合作和相互帮助，像苏联所给予我们两国人民的珍贵援助一样，大大促进和加速社会主义建设。
    中华人民共和国副主席朱德同志和彭真同志为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团在罗马尼亚人民共和国的访问，以及罗马尼亚工人党第一书记乔治乌—德治同志，已故的大国民议会主席团主席彼得鲁·格罗查博士和罗马尼亚议会代表团，部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡同志所率领的政府代表团和利昂廷·萨拉扬率领的军事代表团等在中华人民共和国的访问，对罗马尼亚人民和中国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和合作已经和正在作出贡献。
    罗马尼亚人民以莫大的兴趣和敬佩的心情注视着中国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的伟大成就，并把这些成就看作是自己的成就。中国人民最近在发展国民经济、科学、技术和文化方面所实现的大跃进，使我们大家都感到高兴。
    罗马尼亚人民怀着兄弟般友谊和无产阶级国际主义感情，坚决支持中国人民解放自己固有的领土——台湾和其他被美国侵略者占领的中国沿海岛屿。罗马尼亚人民在工厂和农村中所举行的许多集会上，表现了他们对美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区侵略挑衅的愤怒，并表示完全同情和支持中国人民正义的斗争。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，
    罗马尼亚人民以对伟大的中国人民的友谊感到自豪，能与中国人民一起作为以苏联为首的强大的不可战胜的社会主义阵营的成员感到自豪。
    谨祝中国对社会主义各国的友好协会在加强和发展与各国人民的友谊中获得巨大的胜利。谨祝中罗友好协会在工作上取得重大成果，同时我们将保证，对中罗友协工作给予关心和支持。
    罗马尼亚人民和中国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    伟大的兄弟般的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的，不可战胜的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民大家庭万岁！
