    Produce Crushers to Liberate Labor
    Jing Sheng

    Currently, among the tens of millions of laborers on the steel front, approximately more than half are engaged in the manual crushing of raw materials and fuel. If we can launch a campaign to manufacture a batch of crushing machinery and replace manual labor with mechanical means, a large amount of labor can be freed up. This is of great significance for promoting even greater leaps forward in industry and agriculture both now and in the coming year.

    At present, the crushing of ores, coke, limestone, dolomite, and other materials in various regions is basically done by hand. Crushing ore manually, one person can only crush a few hundred catties [斤, approximately 0.5 kg] per day, while producing one ton of iron requires about three tons of ore. This requires a lot of manpower. Adding the crushing of coke, dolomite, and limestone, the number of people needed is even greater (some large chunks of ore are even difficult for people to break). For example, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee has two 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces, with an average of about 400 people participating in labor each day, of which 200 to 250 people are crushing ore, accounting for more than 50% to 60%; a small steel plant in Boshan, Shandong Province, has two 15.8-cubic-meter blast furnaces and one 13-cubic-meter blast furnace. In the past, nearly 1,000 people were engaged in crushing work every day, but now it is replaced by two crushers. Therefore, launching a campaign to manufacture a batch of crushing machinery to gradually transition the crushing work in steel production to mechanization or semi-mechanization is absolutely necessary. Moreover, the structure of crushing machinery is simple and easy to manufacture; general machinery factories are capable of producing them, and it is entirely possible to rush produce such a batch of machinery.

    Crushing machinery comes in several types, such as hammer-type, roller-type, cone-type, and jaw-type. Generally, hammer-type is suitable for small-sized material; cone-type is suitable for large-scale production; jaw-type has a simple structure and is suitable for harder and medium-sized (20 to 25 mm) material, so it is more suitable for crushing ore. Recently, the Shanghai Mining Machinery Factory also trial-produced a counter-attack crusher (almost between hammer-type and jaw-type), which has a simple structure and high efficiency.

    Taking the jaw crusher as an example, its structure mainly consists of a machine housing, two jaw plates, and a transmission part. The machine housing is generally made of cast steel, but it can also be replaced by welded steel plates, and ductile iron can be tried. The jaw plates are best made of manganese steel to resist wear, but they can also be replaced by white cast iron; manganese steel contains about 12% to 14% manganese, which can be smelted by general converters and electric furnaces. A 400×250 type jaw crusher can crush about 20 tons per hour, the total weight of the machine is about three and a half tons, and it requires 20 kW of power to drive. It can replace the labor of about 600 to 800 people. Similar jaw crushers can be produced by general machinery factories.

    Some places have now begun to design and manufacture some indigenous and simple crushing machinery themselves. This can also improve production efficiency and liberate part of the labor force. For example, the Nanjing First Machine Tool Plant converted a dilapidated hand-operated press into a simple jaw crusher. Its structure is very simple; the jaw plates are made by welding round steel onto two thick steel plates. This machine can replace approximately sixty laborers. The Wuxi Internal Combustion Engine Plant self-made a crusher named "Fighting Bull Type." This crusher is started by hand. A wooden roller track is installed on a wooden frame, and then two 150mm round steels are installed to impact each other. Five people operate it, which can replace the labor of one hundred people. The factory has also trial-produced a simple crusher with a cement and steel mixed structure. The particle size crushed by this mechanized "Fighting Bull Type" crusher is small, making it more suitable for blast furnaces. The Wuxi General Machinery Factory not only improved the "Fighting Bull Type" crusher, but is also designing a "Double Impact Type" crusher specifically for crushing coke. Many units in other regions have also manufactured various types of locally adapted indigenous crushing machinery. The raw material and fuel crushing work for steel production has already begun to enter a new stage.

    In order to rapidly promote this work and solve the current labor shortage in a timely manner, we believe that various localities should, based on the completion of their assigned blast furnace and converter production tasks, urgently produce a batch of crushing machinery and some screening equipment; and mobilize the masses to vigorously develop indigenous crushers and reform various crushing tools to improve the degree of mechanization, improve production efficiency, and ensure the quantity and quality of steel production. Relevant departments may also consider designating special agencies to research and design various simple, combined indigenous and foreign crushers for use in various localities; and urgently conduct experiments on replacing cast steel with cast iron and replacing manganese steel with white cast iron in the manufacture of crushers, draw clear conclusions, and inform various localities.

    生产破碎机　解放劳动力
    经生
    目前，在钢铁战线上的数千万劳动大军中，大约有一半以上的人担当原料、燃料的人工破碎劳动。如果能够突击制造一批破碎机械，用机械代替手工劳动，就可以调出大量的劳动力。这对促进当前以及明年工农业更大的跃进有很大的意义。
    现在各地的矿石、焦炭、石灰石、白云石等的破碎工作，基本上是手工劳动。用人力破碎矿石，一个人一天只能破碎几百斤，而生产一吨铁约需三吨矿石，这就需要很多人力，加上焦炭、白云石、石灰石的破碎工作，需要的人数就更多了（有些大块矿石人们还很难砸碎）。例如，安徽省委有二座十三立方公尺的高炉，每天参加劳动的平均约四百人，其中破碎矿石的有二百至二百五十人，占50％至60％以上；山东博山一个小钢铁厂中，有十五点八立方公尺高炉二座，十三立方公尺高炉一座，过去每天有将近一千人做破碎工作，现在用两台破碎机就代替了。因此，突击制造一批破碎机械，使钢铁生产中的破碎工作逐步过渡到机械化或半机械化，是一件十分必要的事情。而且，破碎机械的构造简单，制造容易，一般的机械工厂都能够生产，赶制这样一批机械也是完全可能的。
    破碎机械有锤式、辊式、圆锥式、颚式等数种型式。通常的情况，锤式适用于小规格料块；圆锥式适合用来大量生产；颚式构造简单，适用于较硬的和中型规格（二十至二十五公厘）的料块，所以比较适合于破碎矿石。最近，上海矿山机械厂还试制了一台反击式破碎机（近乎锤式和颚式之间），构造简单，效率也高。
    以颚式破碎机而言，其构造主要是一个机壳、两块牙板以及传动部分。机壳一般是用铸钢制造，但是也可以用钢板焊接代用，并可试用球墨铸铁。牙板最好是用锰钢的，以耐磨损，但是也可以用白口铁代用；锰钢含锰12％至14％左右，一般转炉和电炉都可以炼制。一台400×250型颚式破碎机，每小时可以破碎二十吨左右，机器总重约三吨半，需要二十瓩动力带动，它大约可以代替六百至八百人的劳动。类似这样的颚式破碎机，一般机械厂都可以生产。
    有些地方现在已经开始自己设计和制造一些土的和简易的破碎机械。这也能够提高生产效率，解放一部分劳动力，例如，南京第一机床厂利用一台破旧的手扳压力机，改装成了一台简易的颚式破碎机。它的构造非常简单，牙板是用元钢焊在两块厚钢板上制成的。这台机器可以代替大约六十个劳动力。无锡内燃机厂自制了一台命名为“斗牛式”的破碎机。这台破碎机是用手起动的，在一个木制的架子上装上木辊道，再安上两根一百五十公厘的元钢，相对撞击，五个人操作，可以代替一百个人的劳动，这个厂还试制成一种水泥、钢铁混合结构的简易破碎机。这种机械化“斗牛式”破碎机破碎的粒度还小，更适合高炉的需要。无锡通用机器厂不仅对“斗牛式”破碎机做了改进，还在设计专为破碎焦炭用的“双击式”破碎机。其他地区的不少单位也制造了各种各样的、适合本地需要的土制破碎机械。钢铁生产的原料、燃料破碎工作已经开始步入新的阶段。
    为了迅速推动这一工作，及时解决当前劳动力紧张的问题，我们认为，各地应该根据本地区担负的高炉和转炉生产任务的完成情况，抓紧突击生产一批破碎机械和一部分筛选设备；并且发动群众大搞土破碎机和改革各种破碎工具，以提高机械化程度，提高生产效率，保证钢铁生产的数量和质量。有关部门也可以考虑指定专门机构研究设计各种简易的土洋结合的破碎机，供各地使用；并且抓紧用铸铁代替铸钢、用白口铁代替锰钢制造破碎机的试验，得出明确的结论，告知各地。
