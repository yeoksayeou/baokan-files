Gao Lan Writes Article Criticizing Modern Revisionism
Yugoslav League Program Glorifies Capitalism
Cut from the Same Cloth as Reformists

    British Communist Party General Secretary John Gollan published an article in the August issue of "Marxism Today" entitled "Modern Revisionism and 'Democratic Socialism'," criticizing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia for its revisionist views on a series of issues, including the capitalist system and the capitalist state, proletarian revolution, and the leading role of proletarian parties.

    Gollan meticulously compared the similar views of the right-wing leadership of the British Labour Party and the Labour Party's right-wing "theorists" on these issues with the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    He first pointed out that "since the end of the Second World War, the main effort of British reformist theory has been to portray modern capitalist society as something new, something fundamentally different from previous capitalism. To this end, it has put forward many arguments, the central one being that the economy is no longer controlled by capital owners, that the driving force of the production system is no longer the pursuit of profit, and that the state—as a so-called independent force—has controlled capitalism, constrained monopolies, and guided the economy in a 'social' direction.

    "This argument says that since the era of laissez-faire capitalism, state intervention in the economy has changed the nature of capitalism to some extent. This state intervention is often regarded as a measure to gradually realize socialism. It is also from this point of view that the nationalization of certain industries is said to be a great step towards socialism."

    Gollan then wrote: "It is useful to compare the common arguments and roots of this modern reformist thought with the revisionist ideas about modern capitalism and the state contained in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. As before, when attempts were made to revise Marxism, the ideas put forward by the revisionists are not new, but are drawn from those already prevalent among the reformists in the labor movement. The authors of the LCY draft program claim that 'Marxist thought has lagged behind the development of modern society in recent decades,' and therefore it is necessary to fill the 'gap in elucidating modern social phenomena.' They attempt to fill this so-called 'gap' with the same analysis of modern social phenomena as the 'theorists' of the Labour Party right wing."

    Has Capitalist Society Changed?

    Gollan then criticized the following assertion in the LCY draft program under the subheading "Has Capitalist Society Changed?": The events since the end of the First World War "have caused tremendous changes in the structure of capitalist society. This change is mainly manifested in the strengthening of the tendency towards state capitalism..."

    Gollan wrote: "Undoubtedly, there have been significant structural changes in capitalist society. But the main change, especially in Britain, is, as Lenin predicted:—the further concentration of capital and the comprehensive strengthening of monopolies. This monopoly has reached such a degree that, out of 291,000 enterprises, only 512 large enterprises account for 50% of the total profits in British industry. In the United States, 200 large companies account for nearly half of the total sales of industrial products. It is this fact that determines the class nature of the tendency of state capitalism. The process of development of state capitalism is the process of monopoly capital strengthening its control over the state and using the state to achieve the goals of monopoly capitalists."

    Referring to the point in the LCY draft program that modern capitalism "can no longer guarantee the expanded reproduction of society in its original form, which is the basis for the continuous renewal and reproduction of the material base and capitalist relations of production," Gollan wrote: "To say that capitalism is now unable to 'renew and reproduce its material base' contradicts the facts. For example, the huge capital investment in the United States after the war (in fact, until 1956, the entire capitalist world had huge capital investments) shows that capitalism is able to renew its material base." Gollan asked: "What are capitalist relations of production? In essence, this is the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie who own the means of production in order to obtain profits. Every (British) worker knows from his own experience that British capitalism has maintained and expanded its profits in the past two decades."

    After citing similar arguments from the "theorists" of the right-wing Labour Party, Gollan pointed out that the Labour Party "theorists" try to prove that, in the post-war period, British workers have no longer suffered "exploitation," and therefore capitalism has been "reformed" and is no longer true capitalism.

    Gollan wrote in this regard: "If these Labour Party reformist views, which have been trained in bourgeois schools and accept bourgeois economic views, reflect a bourgeois attitude towards the capitalist system and are therefore understandable, then how can taking a so-called Marxist attitude lead to the same conclusion? How should it be explained?" Gollan pointed out that, like the writings of British reformists, the LCY draft program regards state intervention as the key to the so-called change in the capitalist economy."

    The Role of the State

    Gollan wrote, "Class-conscious workers will laugh at this whitewash, which regards the state as something independent of monopoly capitalism, and believes that the nationalization of certain 'economic functions' is to allow capitalism, albeit greatly weakened, to continue to exist." This is a "completely wrong 'elucidation' of modern society."

    Gollan then cited facts to refute the claim in the LCY program that the capitalist state "regulates economic life by developing the credit system and using the tax system, or through direct measures, namely nationalizing entire industrial sectors and investing huge amounts of state investment, or, finally, by restricting the power to manage capital and supervise the distribution of profits, incorporating factors of planned economy...taking over a major role in the economy," while "the role of the state as a regulator of labor relations and property relations, social rights and social services, and other social relations has also been strengthened."

    Gollan pointed out that it is necessary to clarify what kind of state is now carrying out all these activities. This question requires studying what powers these states have, how these powers are used, for whose benefit, and for what purpose these powers are used, and so on.

    What Kind of State

    Gollan then analyzed the situation of some departments of the British state apparatus, pointing out that all British state institutions are merely "representatives of trusts operating in the name of the state." He cited an example: "The four members of the Export Credit Advisory Committee represent 38 financial and industrial enterprises respectively. This is typical of these quasi-state institutions. For example, the seven members of the Capital Issues Committee (which manages the issuance of capital securities) represent 28 financial and industrial enterprises respectively. As for the nationalized industrial administrations, as is well known, they are mainly composed of the former directors of these industries and other representatives of private capital. Of the 131 members of the central administration of nationalized industries, almost half are directors of private industry. Among the remaining members, 23 are lords and 9 are landowners. The characteristic of all these institutions is that they are controlled by monopoly capitalists. They constitute a new stage in which the state is subordinate to the trusts. In these countries' economic activities, the state and monopoly capitalists become one."

    Gollan then cited facts to show that the purpose of the British government's budget and economic policies, including measures to raise and lower bank interest rates, is nothing more than to "promote the overall class interests and imperialist interests of British capitalism, regardless of any contradictions between the interests of individual capitalists. There is no independent 'national' interest apart from these interests."

    Gollan said: "But the most absurd departure from Marxism is the LCY draft program's description of the state as a 'regulator of labor relations and property relations.' The wording of this sentence is almost exactly the same as the wording in the Labour Party policy document ('Towards Equality'). This document writes that the Labour Party advocates 'achieving a balance in the use of state power' between social groups and classes. In Britain, whether under a Labour government or under a Conservative government, all our experience has proven that the nature of this 'regulator' role of the state is only for one purpose: to suppress the working class for the benefit of the capitalists. The painful experience before the London bus workers went on strike practically showed the working class the 'regulatory' role of the state."

    The Role of Bureaucracy

    Gollan said, "Therefore, if we do not look at the words but study the facts in 'modern social phenomena,' we cannot but conclude that the idea of an 'independent' state that 'controls' capitalism is propaganda jointly manufactured by British Labour Party reformists and the authors of the LCY draft program. This propaganda cannot conceal the reality of the political and economic dictatorship of monopoly capitalists." Gollan wrote, "In Britain, it is a recognized fact that the upper-level 'bureaucrats,' that is, the heads of the main government departments (who are in fact government 'advisers' whether the Labour Party or the Conservative Party is in power), are asset owners—owners of land, industry, and finance—are members of the ruling class or are closely connected with it. Many of them go directly to financial or industrial companies to take positions when they leave government posts. Their views and interests are consistent with those of the ruling class. It is absurd to regard them as something 'independent' and 'supraclass.' Any 'economic and political power' of the upper-level 'bureaucrats' is entrusted to them by the monopoly capitalists who truly possess economic and political power for a certain purpose."

    Regarding the LCY draft program's statement that "the (capitalist) state machine, in order to obtain its independent functions, often places itself above society and increasingly shows a tendency to restrict the role of private capital and the role of the working class," Gollan wrote: "Undoubtedly, the state restricts or tries to restrict the role of the working class; it can even be said that it restricts the role of small private capital. It restricts the working class and small capitalists for the benefit of the large monopoly capitalists. To call this a 'social' role is tantamount to equating society with the interests of large monopoly organizations."

    Gollan then pointed out that, based on the above point of view, in the LCY draft program, the class struggle is described as a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class for "their influence and position in the state capitalist system."

    Political Implications

    Gollan said, "In launching the workers' struggle for wages, full employment, social issues, and foreign policy, the Communist Party has been fighting to get the British labor and trade union movement to take its own class stand on the overall economic policy and the development of modern capitalist society,...But, for a Communist, all this is done under the condition of exposing the class nature of the state and explaining that to move towards socialism requires a social revolution, to replace the state of monopoly capitalism with a socialist state, to expropriate the big trusts, to establish a new socialist state machine, and to formulate a new constitution."

    Gollan said: "The entire effect of those organized British reformist theories and practices that advocate 'evolution' to socialism, gradually transforming capitalism, and class cooperation is to maintain and expand the power of British monopoly capitalism. Reformist theories and practices lead to the cancellation of the struggle for revolutionary social change. The role played by Yugoslav revisionism ultimately merges with the ideological position of British reformism."

    Gollan then criticized the statement in the LCY draft program that "the more economic functions transferred from private capital to the state, the greater the pressure of new, objectively socialist factors in the economy on the capitalist mode of production" by analyzing the so-called industrial "nationalization" policy of the British Labour Party. Gollan pointed out that "various forms of (capitalist) state intervention in the economy are beneficial to monopoly capital and not to socialism," and so is the nationalization of certain industries implemented by monopoly capitalist states. He wrote: "In fact, this capitalist nationalization implemented in Britain has not exerted any 'pressure' on the capitalist mode of production, nor has it changed the capitalist mode of production in those nationalized industrial enterprises—the production of surplus value. On the contrary, public spending is used to update the equipment of these industries and provide cheap goods and services to those industries that have not yet been nationalized. This nationalization has strengthened the position of monopoly capitalism."

    Gollan said: "The concept that capitalism is gradually growing into socialism is not new. As we have pointed out, it is the essence of British Labour Party reformism. It is the main basis for the right-wing Labour Party's opposition to communism and to all forms of class struggle."

    Gollan pointed out that the LCY draft program, like the Labour Party, also advocates "a gradual transition to socialism economically and politically, in which the task of the working class is reduced to fighting for influence and position and for 'leadership in the government machine.' This is no different from the position of the reformists."

    Gollan then condemned the LCY program for justifying the policies of the capitalist state ruling groups, starting from asserting that capitalism has undergone so-called "changes," and insisted that only "dogmatists" could not see "the influence of the achievements of socialist revolution and socialist practice on the social development and policies of the ruling groups in capitalist countries." Gollan pointed out that this "influence" cannot be seen from the policies of the capitalist state ruling groups. Gollan wrote, "Where is the influence of socialist revolution and socialist practice on the 'policies of the ruling groups of capitalist countries' manifested? Is it manifested in the Cold War, the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its similar organizations in Southeast Asia and the Baghdad Pact Organization, the frenzied manufacture of nuclear weapons and the establishment of bases around socialist countries, the rearmament of Germany, and the stubborn refusal to take any steps to ease international tensions? Undoubtedly, these are the most prominent features of the policies of the 'bourgeois ruling groups' in the most powerful capitalist countries. The entire strength of the mass movement is directed at changing the policies of the bourgeois ruling groups."

    Socialism and the Communist Party

    Gollan finally talked about the role of the Communist Party. He pointed out that the authors of the LCY draft program, starting from the above ideas, just like the right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party, have further developed to the point of belittling the importance of the Communist Party.

    Gollan said: "Denying the leading role of the Communist Party is the logical result of Yugoslavia's fundamentally erroneous analysis of the nature of changes in modern capitalism and the nature and tasks of the transition from capitalism to socialism. This is inevitably the ending of revisionism."

    Gollan analyzed the situation of the British workers' movement, and pointed out that the leading role and responsibilities that the Communist Party must play in the workers' movement are becoming more and more urgently needed day by day. This is because the Communist Party is striving to fulfill its responsibility to develop the unity of the working class. He wrote: "We call on all socialist and progressive forces in the British labor movement to unite, which is an important condition for establishing a socialist government and system in Britain. But all this requires the Communist Party to develop its strength, influence, and numbers to realize its leading role. There can be no progress towards socialism without the victory of Marxism in the British labor movement."

    Gollan concluded by writing that the LCY draft program's explanation of "modern social phenomena" is "very similar to British reformist views, but does not correspond to the actual situation in the capitalist world today. Not only the United States, but also the British, French, and West German monopoly capital groups are now strengthening their control over the state. Therefore, the Yugoslav document cannot be regarded as a Marxist interpretation of modern social phenomena. In essence, it is a revisionist view. Communists working under British capitalist conditions cannot accept the Yugoslav view in theory or practice. Most of the workers in the left-wing workers' movement facing daily class struggle will not accept these views either."

### 高兰著文批判现代修正主义  南共纲领美化资本主义  同改良主义者同出一辙

专栏：

    高兰著文批判现代修正主义
    南共纲领美化资本主义
    同改良主义者同出一辙
    英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰在8月号的
  “今日马克思主义”杂志上发表了一篇题为
  “现代修正主义和‘民主社会主义’”的文章，批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案在关于资本主义制度和资本主义国家、关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级政党的领导作用等一系列问题上的修正主义观点。
    高兰详细地比较了英国工党的右翼领导机构和工党右翼的“理论家”们在这些问题上同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案的类似观点。
    他首先指出，“自从第二次世界大战结束以来，英国改良主义的理论主要是努力把现代资本主义社会说成是某种新的东西，某种同以往的资本主义根本不同的东西。为此，它提出了许多论点，其中心的论点是说经济已经不再受资本所有者的控制了，说生产制度的动力已不再是追求利润了，说国家——作为一个所谓独立的力量——已经控制着资本主义、约束着垄断组织并沿着‘社会的’方向指导着经济。
    “这种论点说，自从自由资本主义的时代以来，国家对经济的干预已经在某种程度上改变了资本主义的性质。这种国家的干预常常被当作是逐步实现社会主义的措施。也是从这种观点出发，某些工业的国有化被说成是走向社会主义的巨大步骤。”
    高兰接着写道：“把这种现代改良主义思想的共同论点和根源同包含在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案中的关于现代资本主义和关于国家的修正主义思想比较一下，是有益处的。正如以前当有人企图修正马克思主义时一样，修正主义者们所提出的思想并不是新的东西，而是从那些已经在劳工运动的改良主义分子中流行着的思想中找出来的。南共纲领草案的作者们声称：‘近几十年来马克思主义思想落后于现代社会的发展’，因此就必须填补‘在阐明现代社会现象方面的空白’，他们企图用同工党右翼的‘理论家’们相同的关于现代社会现象的分析来填补这种所谓的‘空白’。”
    资本主义社会变了吗？
    高兰接着在“资本主义社会改变了吗？”的小标题下批判了南共纲领草案中的这一论断：第一次世界大战结束以来的事态“引起了资本主义社会结构的巨大变化。这种变化主要表现为国家资本主义的倾向的加强……”。
    高兰写道：“毫无疑问，资本主义社会曾经发生了重大的结构上的变化。但是，主要的变化，特别是在英国，是如列宁所预示的：——资本的进一步集中和垄断的全面加强。这种垄断已经达到了这样的程度：在二十九万一千个企业中，仅仅五百一十二家大企业就占了英国工业中总利润的50％。在美国，两百个大公司就占有着工业产品的总销售量的将近一半。是这个事实决定着国家资本主义倾向的阶级性质。国家资本主义的发展的过程就是垄断资本加强对国家的控制和利用国家来实现垄断资本家的目的的过程。”
    在提到南共纲领草案中说现代资本主义已经“不能再以其原有的形式保证社会扩大再生产，而这是物质基础和资本主义生产关系得以不断更新和再生产的基础”这一点的时候，高兰写道：“说资本主义现在无法‘更新和再生产它的物质基础’是和事实相矛盾的。譬如，美国在战后巨大的资本投资（事实上，直到1956年止，整个资本主义世界都有巨大的资本投资）就表明了资本主义是能够更新它的物质基础的。”高兰问道：“什么是资本主义生产关系呢？实质上，这就是占有生产资料的资产阶级为取得利润而对工人阶级进行剥削。每个（英国）工人从他切身的体会中都知道英国资本主义在过去二十年中维持并扩大了它的利润。”
    高兰在引证了右翼工党的“理论家”们的类似论点后指出：工党“理论家”们力图证明，在战后，英国工人已经不再遭受“剥削”了，因而资本主义已经得到“改良”，而不是真正的资本主义了。
    高兰就此写道：“如果经过资产阶级学校训练出来的、接受资产阶级经济观点的人们的这些工党改良主义的观点是对资本主义制度采取资产阶级的态度的反映，因而是可以理解的话，那么，采取一种所谓马克思主义的态度，怎么竟会导致同样的结论呢，应该怎样解释呢？”高兰指出，同英国改良主义者的著作一样，南共纲领草案把国家的干预看作所谓资本主义经济改变的关键。”
    国家的作用
    高兰写道，“对于这种粉饰，即把国家看作独立于垄断资本主义的东西，认定某些‘经济职能’的国家化是为了使尽管已大大被削弱的资本主义继续存在下去的说法，有阶级觉悟的工人是会一笑置之的。”这是“对于现代社会的完全错误的‘阐明’。”
    高兰接着引证事实驳斥了南共纲领中这样一种说法：资本主义国家“通过发展信贷制度和利用税收制度调节经济生活，或通过直接措施即把整个整个的工业部门国有化和投以巨量国家投资，或是，最后，通过限制管理资本权限和监督利润分配，纳入计划经济因素……把经济中的重大作用夺取过来”，同时，“国家作为劳动关系和财产关系、社会权利和社会服务以及其他社会关系的调节者的作用也得到加强”。
    高兰指出，必须弄清楚现在进行所有这一些活动的国家是怎样的国家，这一个问题，必须研究一下这些国家的权力是什么、如何使用这些权力、为谁的利益和为什么目的使用这种权力等问题。
    什么样的国家
    高兰然后分析了英国国家机构的一些部门的情况，指出，所有的英国国家机构都只是“利用国家名义进行活动的托辣斯的代表”。他举例说：“出口信贷咨询委员会的四个委员分别代表三十八家金融和工业企业。这是这些准国家机构的典型。例如，资本问题委员会（它管理资本证券的发行）的七个委员分别代表二十八家金融和工业企业。至于国有化工业管理局，如所周知，它们主要是由这些工业的前董事和其他的私人资本代表组成的。在国有化工业中央管理局的一百三十一个委员中，几乎有一半是私营工业的董事。在其余的委员中有二十三个是勋爵，九个是地主。所有这些机构的特点是：它们都受到垄断资本家的控制。它们构成国家服从于托辣斯的一个新阶段。在这些国家的经济活动中，国家和垄断资本家成为一体。”
    高兰然后引证事实说明，英国政府的预算和经济政策，其中包括提高和降低银行利率等措施的目的不外是要“促进英国资本主义的总的阶级利益和帝国主义利益，不管在个别资本家的利益之间会有什么矛盾。离开这些利益就没有独立的‘国家’利益。”
    高兰说：“但是最荒谬的脱离马克思主义的说法是南共纲领草案把国家说成是‘劳动关系和财产关系的调节者’。这句话的提法就几乎同工党政策文件（‘走向平等’）中的提法完全一样。这个文件写道：工党主张在社会集团和阶级之间，‘在使用国家权力方面取得平衡’。在英国，在工党政府下也好，在保守党政府下也好，我们的一切经验都证明了国家的这种‘调节者’作用的性质只是为了一个目的：为资本家的利益来压制工人阶级。在伦敦公共汽车工人实行罢工之前的惨痛经验就在实践上向工人阶级表明了国家的‘调节’作用。”
    官僚主义的作用
    高兰说：“因此，如果我们不看词句而来研究‘现代社会现象’中的事实，我们就不能不得出结论说：关于‘控制着’资本主义的‘独立的’国家的思想是英国工党改良主义者和南共纲领草案的作者们所共同制造的宣传。这种宣传不能掩盖垄断资本家的政治和经济独裁的现实。”高兰写道：“在英国，公认的事实是：上层的‘官僚分子’、即政府各主要部门的首脑（他们事实上不管是工党或保守党执政时都是政府“顾问”），都是资产所有者——土地、工业和金融所有者——是统治阶级的成员或是与之有密切联系的人。他们之中许多人在离开政府职务的时候就直接到金融或工业公司去任职。他们的观点和利益都与统治阶级的观点和利益一致。把他们看作什么‘独立的’和‘超阶级的’人，是荒唐的。上层‘官僚分子们’的任何‘经济和政治权力’都是由真正具有经济和政治权力的垄断资本家们为一定目的而委托给他们的。”
    关于南共纲领草案所说的“（资本主义）国家机器，为获得其独立的职能，往往把自己置于社会之上，并且日益表现出限制私人资本作用和工人阶级的作用的倾向”这一点，高兰写道：“毫无疑问，国家限制或者尽力限制工人阶级的作用；甚至可以说它限制小私人资本的作用。它是为着大垄断资本家的利益而限制工人阶级和小资本家的。把这种情况叫做一种‘社会’作用等于把社会和大垄断组织的利益等同起来。”
    高兰接着指出，从上述观点出发，在南共纲领草案中，阶级斗争被说成是一种资产阶级同工人阶级为了争夺“其在国家资本主义制度中的影响和地位”而进行的斗争。
    政治的含义
    高兰说：“在发动工人为工资、充分就业、社会问题和外交政策等进行的斗争中，共产党一直进行斗争来使英国劳工和工会运动对总的经济政策和现代资本主义社会的发展情况采取自己的阶级立场，……但是，对于一个共产党人来说，所有这一切都是在这样的条件下做的，即揭露国家的阶级本质和说明要走向社会主义就要进行社会革命，要以社会主义的国家来代替垄断资本主义的国家、剥夺大托辣斯和建立新的社会主义国家机器，制定新的宪法。”
    高兰说：“那些鼓吹向社会主义‘进化’、逐步地，改造资本主义和阶级合作的有组织的英国改良主义理论和实践的整个效果是要保持和扩大英国垄断资本主义的力量。改良主义的理论和实践导致取消为革命的社会变革而进行的斗争。南斯拉夫修正主义所起的作用最终是同英国改良主义的思想立场合流了。”
    高兰接着从分析英国工党的所谓工业“国有化”政策中批判了南共纲领草案中的“由私人资本转给国家的某些经济职能愈多，经济中新的、就其客观趋向来说是社会主义因素对资本主义生产关系方式的压力就愈大”的说法。高兰指出，“（资本主义）国家对于经济的各种干预的各种形式都有利于垄断资本而并非有利于社会主义”，垄断资本主义国家所实行的某些工业国有化也是如此。他写道：“事实上，在英国实行的这种资本主义国有化远没有对资本主义生产方式施加任何‘压力’，就在那些国有化了的工业企业中也没有改变资本主义的生产方式——剩余价值的生产。相反，却用公共开支来更新这些工业的设备并向那些还没有实行国有化的工业提供廉价的货物和服务。这种国有化加强了垄断资本主义的地位。”
    高兰说：“关于资本主义正在逐渐长入社会主义的这个概念并不是新的东西。正如我们所指出的那样，它是英国工党改良主义的实质。它是右翼工党反对共产主义和反对一切形式的阶级斗争的主要根据。”
    高兰指出，南共纲领草案，同工党一样，也主张“在经济上和政治上逐渐过渡到社会主义，在这种过渡中，工人阶级的任务降低为为争取影响和地位以及为争取‘在政府机器中的领导作用’而斗争。这就同改良主义者的立场没有区别了。”
    高兰然后谴责了南共纲领从断言资本主义发生了所谓“变化”出发进而为资本主义国家统治集团的政策进行辩护，硬说，只有“教条主义者”才看不到“社会主义革命和社会主义实践的成就对资本主义国家社会发展和统治集团政策的影响”。高兰指出，从资本主义国家统治集团的政策中是看不出这种“影响”的，高兰写道，“社会主义革命和社会主义实践对‘资本主义国家统治集团的政策’的影响表现在那里呢？是不是表现在冷战，建立北大西洋公约组织和它在东南亚的同类组织以及巴格达条约组织，疯狂地制造核武器和在社会主义国家周围建立基地，重新武装德国以及顽固地拒绝采取任何步骤来缓和国际紧张局势上呢？毫无疑问，这些就是最强大的资本主义国家中的‘资产阶级统治集团’的政策的最显著的特征。群众运动的全部力量也就是指向于改变资产阶级统治集团的政策。”
    社会主义和共产党
    高兰最后谈到了共产党的作用问题，他指出，南共纲领草案的作者，从上述思想出发，正如同英国工党右翼领袖一样，就进一步发展到了贬低共产党的重要性的地步。
    高兰说：“否认共产党的领导作用是南斯拉夫关于现代资本主义中的变化的性质和关于从资本主义到社会主义的过渡的性质和任务的根本错误的分析的逻辑的结果。修正主义收场必然是这样的。”
    高兰分析了英国工人运动的情况，并指出，共产党在工人运动中所必须起的领导作用和必须尽的责任是一天比一天更为迫切需要了。这是因为共产党正努力在完成它尽力发展工人阶级团结的这一个责任。他写道：“我们要求英国劳工运动的一切社会主义的和进步的力量联合起来，这是在英国建立社会主义政府和制度的重要条件。但是这一切都要求共产党发展它的力量、影响和人数，来实现它的领导作用。没有马克思主义在英国劳工运动中的胜利就不能走向社会主义。”
    高兰在结语中写道，南共纲领草案中关于“现代社会现象”的阐明“同英国改良主义的观点很相近，但是同今天在资本主义世界的实际情况并不相符。不只是美国，而且英国，法国和西德垄断资本集团现在都在加强它们对于国家的控制。因此，不能把南斯拉夫的文件看作是对现代社会现象的马克思主义的解释，实质上这是修正主义的看法。在英国资本主义条件下工作的共产党人在理论上或实践上都不能接受南斯拉夫的观点。面对着日常阶级斗争的大多数左翼工人运动中的工人也不会接受这些观点。”
