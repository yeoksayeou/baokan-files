    The mechanical industry is leaping forward at an astonishing speed.
    On the eve of National Day, the mechanical industry reports frequent good news. More than sixty major new products have been manufactured ahead of schedule as gifts for National Day in various regions. These include a 25,000 kW high-voltage steam turbine generator unit, a 4,000 horsepower freight diesel locomotive, a 5,000-ton coastal freighter, a 2,500-ton hydraulic press, a large vertical lathe capable of processing parts with a diameter of 3.4 meters, and a numerically controlled milling machine.
    Under the guidance of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, the production of machinery and equipment in our country has broken through the scope of machinery manufacturing plants. Many repair departments, scientific research institutions, cooperatives, schools, etc., have also entered the ranks of machinery manufacturing. This is the biggest feature of this year's mechanical industry production in our country. During the First Five-Year Plan, only the First Automobile Factory in our country could produce "Liberation" brand cars, but this year more than 100 kinds of various cars have been produced throughout the country. In 1957, our country could not produce tractors, but this year more than 200 kinds of tractors have been produced. In the past, rolling steel equipment always relied on foreign imports. This year, not only heavy machinery plants have produced a lot of rolling steel equipment, but also many general factories have been able to manufacture it. The Sichuan Wangjiang Machine Factory manufactured a set of rolling steel mills with an annual output of 50,000 tons in just one month. Machine tool manufacturing has developed even faster. A few months ago, there were only two machine tool factories in Beijing, but now there are more than 30 machine tool manufacturing units.
    The vast number of workers on the mechanical industry front in our country have achieved brilliant results in attacking the world's cutting-edge technology by breaking superstitions and liberating their minds. In September of this year, the first free-piston gas turbine unit without connecting rods and crankshafts manufactured in our country marked that our country has entered the international advanced technology ranks in engine manufacturing. Because this machine eliminates the crankshaft and connecting rod and uses gas pressure to drive the gas turbine, it combines the internal combustion engine and the gas turbine into one, saving three-quarters of the material. Under the slogan of "Let the red star shine, surpass Britain," workers at the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory in Jiangsu Province trial-produced the first domestically designed 90-horsepower air-cooled diesel engine in our country, enabling our country's power machinery industry to break through another world's cutting-edge technology fortress. This year, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory also produced the world's largest flotation machine, which is 22 meters long and weighs 39 tons and can select 30 to 70 cubic meters of ore sand per minute. After breaking the ideas of "only equipment matters" and "only conditions matter," workers at the Kunming Machine Tool Factory successfully trial-produced the most precise inductive coordinate boring machine without adding any equipment. The parts processed by this machine can achieve a precision of 0.005 mm, which is equivalent to one-sixteenth of a hair. This year, the mechanical industry in our country has also manufactured horizontal nitrogen-hydrogen compressors for large-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants and successfully trial-produced important products such as electronic digital computers.
    At present, the "ants gnawing at bones" method of using small machine tools to process large parts commonly used in mechanical processing in various regions, and the "turning big into small, combining small into big" method of using electroslag welding in blank manufacturing, show the infinite creative wisdom of our country's mechanical workers. Electroslag welding is still rarely used in capitalist countries. It can weld thicknesses that general welding methods cannot achieve, so it is possible to divide large parts into several small forgings and castings first, and then weld them into large parts. The successful trial of this method has broken through the limitations of the current mechanical manufacturing equipment capacity in terms of product size and weight, so that general factories lacking heavy forging equipment and conditions for producing large steel castings can solve the manufacturing problems of large parts themselves. The Harbin Boiler Factory recently successfully applied this method to cast steel high-pressure vessels. This achievement has made our country's high-pressure vessel manufacturing level leap into the world's advanced ranks. This year, our country's mechanical industry also promoted rapid heating methods in heat treatment, introduced bottomless forging hammers in forging, and achieved achievements such as using sand-free molds and die-casting ferrous metals in casting. Hot-rolled gears are a new cutting-edge technology in the world, and many capitalist countries are still in the experimental stage. Now, many factories in our country have begun to use them. Because this method directly rolls the blank into gears, it greatly reduces the processing process, increases efficiency by 10 to 40 times, and saves about 20% of the material.

### 机械工业跨入世界先进行列  各地职工提前制成六十多种新产品作国庆献礼

    机械工业跨入世界先进行列
    各地职工提前制成六十多种新产品作国庆献礼
    本报讯　我国机械工业正在以惊人的速度飞跃前进。
    国庆节前夕，机械工业捷报频传。各地为国庆节献礼而提前制造出来的重大新产品达六十多种，其中有两万五千瓩高压汽轮发电机组，四千马力货运内燃机车，载重五千吨的近海货轮，二千五百吨水压机，可以加工直径三点四公尺部件的大型立式车床，程序自动控制的铣床等。
    在全党全民办工业的方针指导下，我国机器设备的生产已经突破了机械制造厂的范围，很多修理部门、科学研究机关、合作社、学校等也都走进了机械制造的行列。这是今年我国机械工业生产的最大特点。第一个五年计划时，我国只有第一汽车厂能生产“解放牌”汽车，而今年全国各地生产出的各式各样的汽车有一百多种。1957年我国还不能生产拖拉机，今年已经生产拖拉机二百多种。轧钢设备过去一向依靠国外进口，今年不但重型机器厂生产了许多轧钢设备，不少一般的工厂也已经能够制造。四川望江机器厂在短短一个月的时间内，就制出一套年产五万吨的轧钢机。机床制造发展得更快。北京市几个月前还只有两个机床厂，现在已经有三十多个机床制造单位。
    我国机械工业战线上的广大职工，由于破除迷信，解放思想，在向世界尖端技术进攻方面，已取得辉煌战果。今年9月间，我国制造出的第一台没有连杆和曲轴的自由活塞式燃气轮机组，标志了我国在发动机制造上已进入国际先进技术行列。由于这种机器取消了曲轴和连杆，利用燃气压力推动燃气轮，把内燃机和燃气轮机合而为一，节省材料四分之三。江苏无锡柴油机厂职工在“放红星，超英国”的口号下，试制出我国第一台自行设计的九十马力风冷式柴油机，使我国动力机械工业又攻破了一项世界尖端技术堡垒。今年，在沈阳矿山机器厂还生产出了一种世界上最大的浮选机，长二十二公尺，重三十九吨，每分钟能选出三十至七十立方公尺的矿砂。昆明机床厂职工在打破“唯设备论”、“唯条件论”思想后，在没有增加一点设备的情况下，试制成功最精密的电感应座标镗床。这种机器加工出的部件，精密度可达到千分之五毫米，相当一根头发的十六分之一。我国机械工业在今年还制出了大型氮肥厂用的卧式氮氢气压缩机，试制成功了电子数字计算机等重要产品。
    目前各地在机械加工方面普遍采用的用小机床加工大部件的“蚂蚁啃骨头”的方法，在毛胚制造方面的“化大为小、以小并大”的用电渣焊接的方法等，显示了我国机械工人无穷的创造智慧。电渣焊，目前资本主义国家还很少采用。它能焊接一般焊接方法所不能达到的厚度，这样就可能把大的部件先分成几段小的锻、铸件，然后并焊成大件。这种方法试验成功，突破了现在机械制造设备能力在产品尺寸重量上的限制，使缺乏重型锻压设备和生产大铸钢件条件的一般工厂，都能自己解决大型部件的制造问题。哈尔滨锅炉厂最近把这种办法成功地运用到铸钢高压容器上去。这一成就，使我国高压容器制造水平跨进世界先进行列。今年，我国机械工业还在热处理方面推行了快速加热方法，在锻造方面出现了无底座锻锤，在铸造方面取得了不用砂型、压铸黑色金属等成就。热轧齿轮在世界上是一种新的尖端技术，很多资本主义国家还在试验阶段，现在我国很多工厂已经开始采用。由于这种方法直接把毛胚轧成齿轮，大大减少了加工过程，效率提高十倍到四十倍，并能节省材料20％左右。
