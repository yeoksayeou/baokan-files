    The Aggressors Are Working Hard to Expose Themselves
    Commentator of this newspaper

    It has been almost three months since the American troops invaded Lebanon. It has also been more than a month since the United Nations General Assembly Special Emergency Session passed a resolution demanding the early withdrawal of American troops from Lebanon. However, the American troops are still clinging to Lebanon and refusing to leave. What are they doing there? The facts are now clearer.

    Eisenhower said on July 15 that the American troops landed in Lebanon to "stabilize" the situation there. This was originally an excuse of the aggressors. Now even this excuse has been exposed by the United States itself, because it is precisely the United States that is creating chaos in Lebanon. Before Chamoun stepped down, the United States prepared to further exploit the Chamoun group. It allocated huge sums of money to help Chamoun establish the so-called "Liberal National Party," and supplied a large number of weapons to fascist thugs such as the Phalange and the National Social Party who supported Chamoun. As soon as Chamoun stepped down and the Karami cabinet was established, Chamoun's party members immediately began various provocative and destructive activities. At the instigation of the United States, they burned, killed, looted, forced strikes, and disrupted transportation, becoming increasingly rampant. At the same time, the American troops directly provoked and threatened the Lebanese people. On October 8, thirty-seven American tanks suddenly occupied areas such as the Basta district in Beirut, which were previously controlled by the insurgents who opposed Chamoun. American soldiers conducted exercises on nearby beaches, fired into the air, and launched rockets that passed over the Basta district and exploded in the sea. All this has made the situation in Lebanon tense again.

    The reason why the United States wants to create this tense situation is to put pressure on the Karami cabinet, shamelessly interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, and impose its will on others. The American ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, disregarding the most basic principles and etiquette of international diplomacy, openly held a "reception" at the American embassy, demanding that the Karami government be reorganized and that four ministerial positions be given to Chamoun's followers. This is how the United States uses their tanks and artillery, rockets and machine guns, plus Chamoun's thugs and the ambassador in a tuxedo, to defend Lebanon's "political independence"! Is it not clear what they mean by "political independence"? Facts have proved that the American troops are clinging to Lebanon, just as they landed in Lebanon, with the aim of suppressing Lebanon's national independence movement and patriotic democratic forces, expanding their own aggressive forces, and using Lebanon as a base to promote the United States' colonial policy in the entire Middle East region.

    The reason why the United States wants to create a tense situation in Lebanon is also to delay the withdrawal of troops. Due to the pressing situation, under the pressure of the Lebanese and world people, the US State Department had to issue a statement on October 8, saying that the US military would completely withdraw from Lebanon before the end of October. But it immediately added a condition: "unless unforeseen circumstances arise." On October 9, the US Acting Secretary of Defense, Quarles, also said that if Karami resigned, it would affect the US military's withdrawal from Lebanon. However, who is creating the so-called "unforeseen circumstances" in Lebanon? Who is forcing Karami to step down? It is precisely the United States itself. Isn't this kind of trick too clumsy? It cannot escape the condemnation of public opinion, but will only let the people of the world see what a rogue aggressor the United States is!

    The American troops landing in Lebanon was originally an aggression. Their clinging there and continuing to provoke the Lebanese people and interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs has added new evidence and charges. The American aggressors are giving a live demonstration and exposing themselves in Lebanon every day, and no one can replace their role. However, it will be difficult for the United States to continue this beneficial work in Lebanon after all. The Lebanese government officially informed the United States on October 9, demanding that the American occupying forces must completely withdraw from Lebanon before the end of October "regardless of any conditions." At the same time, the Karami cabinet also announced that it would continue to remain in office. Lebanon's internal affairs brook no American interference, and the American troops must get out quickly unconditionally! This is the unanimous call of the Lebanese people and the people of the world.

    侵略者正在努力揭露自己
    本报评论员
    美国军队侵入黎巴嫩已经近三个月了。联合国大会紧急特别会议通过决议要求美军早日从黎巴嫩撤退，也已经一个多月了。但是，美军至今仍然赖在黎巴嫩不走。他们呆在那里做什么呢？现在的事实是更加清楚了。
    艾森豪威尔在7月15日曾经说，美军登陆黎巴嫩是为了“稳定”那里的局势。这本来就是侵略者的借口。现在连这个借口也被美国自己揭穿了，因为恰恰是美国，正在黎巴嫩制造混乱局面。美国在夏蒙下台以前，就为进一步利用夏蒙集团作了准备。它拨出巨款帮助夏蒙成立了所谓“自由国民党”，并且把大批武器供给支持夏蒙的长枪党和国家社会党等法西斯党徒。等到夏蒙下台，卡拉米内阁一成立，夏蒙党徒就立即开始各种挑衅破坏活动。在美国唆使下，他们烧杀掳掠，强迫罢市，破坏交通，已经越来越猖狂。在这同时，美国军队又直接向黎巴嫩人民进行挑衅和威胁。10月8日，有三十七辆美国坦克突然占领了贝鲁特市内以前由反对夏蒙的起义者所控制的巴斯塔区等地区。美国士兵在附近海滩上进行演习，向空中开火，并且放射火箭穿过巴斯塔区上空，然后落在大海里爆炸。这一切就使黎巴嫩的局势重新紧张起来了。
    美国所以要制造这种紧张局势，是为了对卡拉米内阁施加压力，无耻地干涉黎巴嫩内政，好把它的意志强加于人。美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克不顾国际外交的最起码的准则和礼貌，公然在美国大使馆举行“招待会”，要求卡拉米政府改组，把四个部长职位让给夏蒙分子。美国就是这样用他们的坦克和大炮，火箭和机关枪，加上夏蒙的打手和穿着礼服的大使先生，来保卫黎巴嫩的“政治独立”！他们所说的“政治独立”究竟是什么，难道还不明白吗？事实证明，美国军队赖在黎巴嫩不走，正同它在黎巴嫩登陆一样，其目的就是为了压制黎巴嫩的民族独立运动和爱国民主力量，扩张自己的侵略势力，并把黎巴嫩作为据点，进而在整个中东地区推行美国的殖民政策。
    美国所以要在黎巴嫩制造紧张局势，也是为了拖延撤兵。由于形势逼人，在黎巴嫩和全世界人民的压力下，美国国务院在10月8日不得不发表声明说，美军将于10月底以前从黎巴嫩全部撤退。但是它马上就附加了一个条件：“除非出现无法预料的局势”。10月9日，美国代理国防部长卡利斯又说，如果卡拉米辞职，那就将影响美军撤出黎巴嫩。可是，正在黎巴嫩制造所谓“无法预料的局势”的是谁呢？正在逼迫卡拉米下台的又是谁呢？恰恰就是美国自己。这样的手法不是太拙劣了吗？它并不能逃避舆论的谴责，而只会让全世界人民都看到，美国是个多么惯于耍流氓的侵略者！
    美国军队登陆黎巴嫩，本来就是侵略。它赖在那里不走，继续向黎巴嫩人民挑衅，干涉黎巴嫩内政，这就又增加了新的证据和罪状。美国侵略者天天在黎巴嫩现身说法，揭露自己，其作用是任何人也不能代替的。但是，美国这种有益的工作毕竟很难在黎巴嫩继续做下去了。黎巴嫩政府10月9日已经正式照会美国，要求美国占领军“不管在任何条件下”都必须在10月底以前完全撤出黎巴嫩。同时，卡拉米内阁也宣布要继续留任。黎巴嫩内政不容美国干涉，美国军队必须无条件地赶快滚蛋！这就是黎巴嫩人民和全世界人民的一致呼声。
