Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 22nd: On the eve of the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Yinchuan City is presenting a joyous festive scene, with people of all ethnic groups happily welcoming the birth of the autonomous region.

　　Yinchuan City, decorated with banners and colorful slogans, is especially beautiful. All government offices, factories, schools, and shops have erected colorful arches at their entrances and on the streets, pasted up couplets, and hung colorful palace lanterns. Various flags are hung high on the buildings along the main streets.

　　The Ningxia Economic Construction Achievements Exhibition Hall, which is scheduled to open during the establishment of the autonomous region, is basically ready. The staff of the exhibition hall are busy displaying exhibits and carefully setting up various electric models.

　　Yinchuan Railway Station appears particularly lively. All preparations have been made here to welcome guests. On the tall colorful archway, the golden characters "Salute to the Central Government and Delegation from various Regions" are dazzling. These days, the people of Yinchuan are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the delegation representing Chairman Mao to congratulate the establishment of the autonomous region. In the sewing factories of the people's communes in the suburbs, female workers have been working day and night to make new cotton clothes for Hui and Han commune members. Commune members, street residents, and elementary school students are all preparing to put on new clothes and welcome the representatives of the Central Government and various provinces and regions upon their arrival. Commune members in the suburbs have also vacated their best houses as reception rooms; they have created many tall "bumper harvest towers" using products from various high-yield "satellite" fields to welcome guests to visit.

　　Workers are using their new achievements to welcome the establishment of the autonomous region. The steelmaking workers of the Yinchuan Agricultural Machinery Factory have written their bold aspirations on the newly built cupola furnace: "We will make the Yellow River flow backwards, use the Helan Mountains as pillows, and unite as one to complete the steelmaking task without fail!" The Yinchuan Rolling Ball Bearing Factory has manufactured a large number of blowers for steel production. The employees of the Yinchuan Wool Textile Factory, famous for improving technology and trial-producing high-quality jacquard blankets during the technical innovation movement, have proposed to complete the annual production plan forty days ahead of schedule and the October production task seven days ahead of schedule to welcome the establishment of the autonomous region.

　　These days, dawn comes especially early to the suburbs of Yinchuan City. Hui and Han commune members, who have recently joined the people's communes, brave the cold wind of the late autumn mornings to deep-plow the land, hoping to make next year's crops grow even better.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan: The soon-to-be-established Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has received strong support from all parts of the country in terms of manpower and materials during its construction. At Yinchuan Railway Station, the capital of the autonomous region, three to five hundred Hui and Han cadres and workers from all parts of the country arrive every day to participate in the construction; thousands of tons of construction materials are unloaded here every day and then transported to various construction sites. Since the spring of this year, more than 70,000 cadres and workers of various ethnic groups from all over the country have come to Ningxia to participate in production and construction.

    宁夏回族自治区成立前夕
    银川一片欢乐景象
    新华社银川22日电　在宁夏回族自治区成立的前夕，银川市呈现了一片节日的欢乐景象，各族人民正兴高采烈地迎接自治区的诞生。
    银川市被锦旗和彩色标语装饰着格外美丽。所有的机关、工厂、学校、商店的门口和街头，都搭起了彩牌，贴上对联，挂着彩色的宫灯。通衢大街的建筑物上，高悬起各色旗帜。
    准备在自治区成立期间开幕的宁夏经济建设成就展览馆，已经基本上筹备就绪。展览馆的工作人员，正在忙着陈列展品，精心设置各种电动模型。
    银川市的火车站显得特别热闹。这里已经做好了迎接宾客的一切准备。高大的彩门上，写着“向中央及各地代表团致敬”的金色大字，鲜艳夺目。这几天，银川人急切地等待欢迎代表毛主席前来祝贺自治区成立的代表。郊区各人民公社的缝纫厂里，女工们连日来为回、汉族社员赶制新棉衣。公社社员、街道居民和小学生们，都准备在中央和各省区的代表到达时，穿上新装前往欢迎。郊区的社员们，还把最好的房子腾出来，作为招待室；用各种丰产“卫星”田的产品作成许多高大的“丰产塔”，迎接客人参观。
    工人们用自己新的成就来迎接自治区的成立。银川市农具机械厂的炼钢工人，在新建的冲天炉上写着自己的豪言壮语：“足踏黄河水倒流，搬倒贺兰山当枕头，大家拧成一股劲，不完成钢铁任务誓不罢休！”银川市滚珠轴承厂已为钢铁生产制造了大批的鼓风机。在技术革新运动中，因改进技术试制出质量优异的提花毛毯而闻名的银川毛纺织厂职工，为迎接自治区的成立，提出要提前四十天完成全年生产计划，提前七天完成10月份生产任务。
    这几天，银川市的郊区，黎明也来得特别早。加入人民公社不久的回族、汉族社员，每天冒着深秋早晨的寒风深翻土地，他们要使明年的庄稼长得更好。
    据新华社银川电　即将成立的宁夏回族自治区，在建设中得到全国各地人力物力的大力支援。在自治区首府银川市火车站上，每天接待三、五百名从祖国各地前来参加建设的回族、汉族干部和职工；每天有千百吨建设物资在这里卸下，再转运到各个建设工地。今年春天以来，全国各地到宁夏参加生产建设的各族干部和职工已达七万多人。
