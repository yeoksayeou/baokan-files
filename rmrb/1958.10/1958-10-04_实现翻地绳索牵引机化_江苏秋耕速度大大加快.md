Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd October. Following the achievement of bearingization, Jiangsu Province has also overfulfilled the task of manufacturing and promoting more than 610,000 sets of rope traction machines by the end of September, becoming the first province in the country to achieve mechanized deep plowing with rope traction machines.

The increasing use of rope traction machines for deep plowing has accelerated the pace of deep plowing in Jiangsu Province. Various counties and cities in Jiangsu Province started pilot projects for deep plowing during the summer planting season this year. After the early autumn crops were harvested, many areas seized the opportunity during the agricultural slack season and followed the principle of "harvesting one plot, plowing one plot," comprehensively commencing deep plowing. By mid-September, the province had deep plowed five million mu of land. By the end of September, the speed of deep plowing had surged to over ten million mu, with a more significant improvement in the quality of plowing compared to the previous stage. The Xiaoji People's Commune in Jiangdu County established a deep plowing field corps of over 15,000 people, concentrating more than 2,200 rope traction machines, bringing their own food and backpacks, and camping in the fields, working day and night to carry out large-scale deep plowing. Rope traction machines are the heavy weapons of this field corps. Each machine is operated by five people, with a daily tillage capacity of three to five mu, to a depth of 1.2 to 1.5 chi (approximately 40 to 50 cm). According to statistics for the six days that rope traction machines were put into operation, a total of more than 30,000 mu of land was deep plowed, accounting for 35.7% of the commune's entire autumn sowing area. They plan to have all 84,000 mu of wheat fields plowed by October 5, which is expected to be one month earlier than in previous years, saving 300,000 to 500,000 laborers. In order to fully unleash the combat power of rope traction machines, the Shangyou Commune Field Regiment in Jiangpu County trained more than 400 rope traction machine operators, requiring each person to be able to use, install, and repair them. This field regiment also established a repair and fitting factory, and each combat company was also equipped with one or two skilled carpenters responsible for the repair and fitting of larger components, ensuring that "people and cattle can rest, but machines cannot."

The deployment of more than 600,000 sets of rope traction machines for deep plowing has resolved the contradiction of labor shortages during this year's autumn harvest and sowing season, ensuring that the agricultural season is not missed. This year, the total autumn sowing area for wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas in Jiangsu Province is 43 million mu, with deep plowing and sowing carried out in stages and batches according to the order of the crops. The first stage of deep plowing, covering 13 million mu, has now been basically completed. The second stage of deep plowing, covering 10 million mu, has already begun.

    实现翻地绳索牵引机化  江苏秋耕速度大大加快
    新华社南京3日电　江苏省继实现轴承化之后，又在9月底超额完成了六十一万多套绳索牵引机的制造和推广的任务，成为全国最先实现深翻土地绳索牵引机化的省。
    绳索牵引机越来越多的投入深翻，使江苏省深翻土地的速度越来越快。江苏各县市从今年夏种时就开始了深翻土地的试点工作，不少地区在早秋作物登场后，就抓紧农时的空隙，掌握“收一块，翻一块”的原则，全面开始深翻，到9月中旬，全省深翻土地五百万亩。到9月底，深翻土地的速度就猛增到一千万多亩，在翻土的质量上较前一阶段更有显著的提高。江都县小纪人民公社，建立了一万五千多人的深翻野战兵团，集中了二千二百多部绳索牵引机，自带粮食，自带背包，扎营田头，夜以继日地进行大面积深翻。绳索牵引机是这个野战兵团的重武器，每机五人操作，每日耕作量三到五亩，深度一尺二到一尺五。据绳索牵引机投入战斗的六天统计，共深翻土地三万多亩，占这个公社整个秋播面积的35.7％。他们打算在10月5日前，将八万四千亩三麦田全部翻完，预计可比往年提早一个月，节省三十万到五十万个劳力。江浦县上游公社野战团为了充分发挥绳索牵引机的战斗威力，训练了四百多名绳索牵引机手，要求个个会使用、会安装、会修理。这个野战团还设了一个修配厂，每个战斗连还配备一、二个有技术的木匠，负责较大部件的修配，做到“歇人歇牛不歇机”。
    六十多万套绳索牵引机投入深翻，解决了今年秋收及秋种期间劳动力紧张的矛盾，确保不误农时。今年江苏全省三麦、油菜和蚕豆、豌豆的秋播面积共四千三百万亩，按照作物的茬口先后，分期、分批的进行深翻播种。现在第一阶段深翻一千三百万亩的任务已基本上完成。第二阶段一千万亩深翻工作又已开始。
