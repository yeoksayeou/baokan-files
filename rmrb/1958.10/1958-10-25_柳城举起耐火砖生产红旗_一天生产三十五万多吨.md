    Liucheng Raises the Red Banner of Firebrick Production
    Daily Output Exceeds 350,000 Tons

    Xinhua News Agency, Liucheng, October 21st. Liucheng County in Guangxi, which previously set a high-yield record of over 86,000 tons of coal produced daily using indigenous methods, launched an even larger “satellite” on the 19th, with a daily output of 352,100 tons of firebricks. This output exceeds the total firebricks produced by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from January to September this year by forty times.

    These firebricks are not fired, but cut from fire-resistant stone. Liucheng County has very rich reserves of fire-resistant stone, and the quality is excellent, so it does not need to be fired. As long as the fire-resistant stone is mined and cut into small bricks, it can be used.

    柳城举起耐火砖生产红旗
    一天生产三十五万多吨
    据新华社柳城21日电　曾创土法采煤日产八万六千多吨高产纪录的广西柳城县，在19日又放出日产三十五万二千一百吨耐火砖的巨大“卫星”。这一产量，超过广西僮族自治区今年1到9月生产的耐火砖总和四十倍。
    这些耐火砖不是烧制出来的，是由耐火石切制而成的。柳城县耐火石的蕴藏量十分丰富，质量良好，因此不用烧炼，只要把打下的耐火石切成小砖块，就可以使用。
