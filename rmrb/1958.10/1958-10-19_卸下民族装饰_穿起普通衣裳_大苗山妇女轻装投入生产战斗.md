    From our newspaper in Nanning, October 18th: Shedding their embroidered clothes and abandoning their pleated skirts, women of the Miao, Dong, and Yao ethnicities in the Greater Miao Mountains Miao Autonomous County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are vigorously reforming clothing that hinders production.

    Currently, among the more than 60,000 Miao, Dong, and Yao women in the entire autonomous county, nearly 4,000 have already put on newly made casual wear. Because they have freed themselves from tedious needlework, the women's annual work attendance has increased from 120 days in the past to 330 days. Now, many women carry three things with them: a hatchet for logging production, a small blackboard for learning to read and write, and a wooden rifle for participating in military training. They work like the wind and move very quickly. A few days ago, eleven people's communes throughout the county opened eleven new logging sites. Thousands of Miao, Dong, and Yao women, carrying luggage and rice, barefoot and wearing straw hats, traversed mountains and rivers just like the men, eating on the mountains and living on the hilltops, vigorously cutting bamboo and wood to support industrial construction, no longer delayed by the encumbrance of clothing.

    The original clothing of Miao, Dong, and Yao women, each set (including headscarf, apron, embroidered jacket, pleated skirt, and leggings), used more than two lengths of cloth and generally weighed more than five *jin* (approximately 2.5 kg). Adding heavy silver and jade ornaments such as necklaces, bracelets, and hairpins (the heaviest weighing 32 *jin*), made movement even more inconvenient. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, women of all ethnicities have urgently demanded the reform of this traditional clothing that hinders production, to change to casual wear in order to further participate in productive labor.

    The demands of the Miao, Dong, and Yao women of the Greater Miao Mountains to reform clothing have been given importance by local Party and government departments, which have successively held four on-site meetings in Hecun, Antai, and other places to actively promote it. At the on-site meeting held in Antai at the end of September, encompassing the entire autonomous county, all 56 representatives from the Dongfanghong and Wanbaoshan People's Communes wore casual clothes of bright colors and different styles. They happily said that wearing casual clothes has seven major benefits: it's convenient for going up mountains and working in the fields; it’s easy to wash and change; it saves labor; it saves cloth; it saves money; not embroidering leaves time to learn to read and write; and the colors are plentiful and the designs are good. Fourteen representatives from the Baiyun People's Commune unanimously stated that original clothing can still be worn during meetings and studies; if new clothes are added, they will all be changed to casual wear and no longer embroidered. Some representatives even rushed to make well-fitting casual clothes during the meeting, specifically for production work. Some women had concerns about reforming clothing, fearing that young men would not love them, and that older people would say strange things. After discussions at the on-site meeting, they have realized that love and marriage are not conditional on the quality of clothing, but on the standard of good production labor. As long as it is beneficial to developing production, reforms should be boldly carried out.

### 卸下民族装饰　穿起普通衣裳  大苗山妇女轻装投入生产战斗

    卸下民族装饰　穿起普通衣裳
    大苗山妇女轻装投入生产战斗
    本报南宁18日电　脱去绣花衣，不作百折裙，广西僮族自治区大苗山苗族自治县苗、侗、瑶族妇女大力改革不利于生产的服装。
    现在，全自治县六万多苗、侗、瑶族妇女中，有近四千名妇女已经穿上了新制便装。妇女们由于从繁琐的针线活中解脱出来，全年出工时间已由过去的一百二十天增加到三百三十天，现在，许多妇女身边都带有三件东西：伐木生产用的柴刀，学文化用的小黑板和参加军事训练用的木枪。干起活来一阵风，行动非常迅速。几天前，全县有十一个人民公社新辟了十一个伐木工地，成千的苗、侗、瑶族妇女担起行李和大米，赤着脚戴着草帽，和男子一样翻山涉水，吃在山上，住在山头，大砍竹木，支援工业建设，再也不为服装的拖累而延误生产了。
    苗、侗、瑶族妇女的原有服装，每套（包括头巾、围肚、绣花衣、百折裙和脚笼）用布两丈多，重量一般都在五市斤以上。如果加上项圈、手镯、头花等沉重的银、玉首饰（最重的有三十二斤），行动更加不便。几年来，特别是大跃进以来，各族妇女迫切要求改革这种妨碍生产的传统服装，改穿便装，以进一步参加生产劳动。
    大苗山苗、侗、瑶族妇女提出改革服装的要求，得到各地党政部门的重视，曾先后在河村、安泰等地召开了四次现场会议，积极加以倡导。9月底在安泰举行的全自治县范围的现场会议上，东方红和万宝山两个人民公社的五十六名代表，全部穿上了色泽鲜明、样式不同的便装，她们高兴地说，穿便装有七大好处：上山下田生产便当；好洗好换；省工；省布；省钱；不绣花有时间学文化；颜色多花样好。白云人民公社十四名代表一致表示，在开会、学习时，原有服装仍可穿戴；如果再添制新衣，就一律改成便装，不再刺绣。有的代表在会议期间就赶制了合身便装，专备生产时穿用。也曾有少数妇女对改革服装有顾虑，怕男青年不爱，怕老年人讲怪话。经过现场会议的讨论后，她们已经认识到恋爱结婚不以穿衣好坏为条件，而是以生产劳动好坏为标准，只要有利于发展生产，就应该大胆地进行改革。
