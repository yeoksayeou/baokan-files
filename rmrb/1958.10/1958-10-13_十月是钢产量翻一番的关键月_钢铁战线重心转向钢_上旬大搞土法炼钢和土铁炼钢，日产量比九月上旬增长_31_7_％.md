Xinhua News Agency, 12th. October. October is the crucial month for the people of the entire nation to double steel production this year. The current situation on the steel front is that iron production has accumulated relatively more experience, and many regions have begun to shift the focus of their leadership in steel production to grasping steel. Regions where pig iron production increased in September but did not reach the required level have also taken measures to grasp both iron and steel.

In the first ten days of October, the national average daily steel production increased by 31.7% compared to the first ten days of September. All regions are universally adopting the "small, indigenous, and mass" line to vigorously promote the movement of steelmaking by indigenous methods. This is an important way to implement the policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises in the steel industry, combining "indigenous" and "foreign" methods, and rapidly increasing steelmaking capacity. Many regions have sorted out and summarized their local experience in steelmaking by indigenous methods and are promoting it while stepping up the construction of various indigenous steelmaking furnaces. Henan, Shanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces, where steelmaking by indigenous methods has made faster progress, have created some successful experiences. Shangcheng and Xinyang counties in Henan, and the Gu Xian Iron and Steel Plant in the Changzhi area of ​​Shanxi Province, took the lead in creating a high-yield record of producing 1,000 tons of steel per day. Subsequently, Henan Province created a record of producing 10,000 tons of steel per day. The experience of these regions, which started with steelmaking by indigenous methods, has received widespread attention throughout the country, and in recent days, batches of people from various provinces have been coming to observe and learn.

The eighteen key iron and steel enterprises, which account for more than 70% of the national steel output in October, increased their steel output by 17.2% in these ten days compared to the first ten days of September. Since the beginning of October, the vast majority of steel plants across the country have been facing a new topic: the iron produced by indigenous methods contains more sulfur, phosphorus, and other impurities, but good steel must be made from this indigenous iron. The masses of workers in the steel plants, with an indomitable spirit, are doing everything possible, day and night, to wage a tenacious struggle against the various harmful impurities in the indigenous iron. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry promptly convened an on-site meeting in Tianjin to exchange and promote the experience already gained in this regard.

The national average daily pig iron production increased by 111.6% in the first ten days of October compared to the first ten days of September. From now on for a considerable period, the two urgent problems facing the national steel army are: striving to improve the quality of pig iron; and transporting a large amount of pig iron from thousands upon thousands of extremely dispersed smelting points in a timely manner to meet the needs of steelmaking.

October is of decisive significance for completing this year's plan of 10.7 million tons of steel. However, the growth rate of steel production in the first ten days has not yet reached the expected requirements, which brings heavier tasks for the middle and late ten days. Now it is becoming more and more obvious that the great leap forward in steel production is not only a matter for the steel industry itself, but also that transportation, coal supply, mechanical manufacturing, electricity, geological exploration, and other tasks must keep up in a timely manner and cooperate with each other; none can be missing. The relevant leading departments require the large army fighting on the steel front to take all measures to give full play to the production potential of the original steelmaking furnaces of the key enterprises; to ensure that the newly built converters are put into production and normal production as soon as possible; to quickly launch a high tide of mass movement for steelmaking by indigenous methods; and to mobilize all the smelting equipment of non-metallurgical industrial systems and put them into the ranks of steelmaking.

    十月是钢产量翻一番的关键月
    钢铁战线重心转向钢
    上旬大搞土法炼钢和土铁炼钢，日产量比九月上旬增长31.7％
    新华社12日讯　10月是全国人民为今年钢铁产量翻一番的关键月。目前钢铁战线上的情势是，铁的生产已经积累了比较多的经验，许多地区对钢铁生产的领导重心已经开始转向抓钢；生铁产量在9月份虽有增进、但还没有达到要求水平的地区，也已经采取措施，一手抓铁，一手抓钢。
    10月的头十天，全国钢的平均日产量，比9月上旬增长了31.7％。各地正在普遍采取“小、土、群”的路线，大搞土法炼钢运动。这是当前贯彻执行钢铁工业大、中、小企业同时并举和“土”、“洋”结合的方针，迅速提高炼钢能力的一条重要途径。许多地区整理和总结了当地土法炼钢的经验，正在推广，同时加紧建设各种土炼钢炉。土法炼钢进展较快的河南、山西、四川、湖南等省，已经创造出一些成功的经验。河南的商城、信阳两县和山西省长治专区的故县钢铁厂，首先创造了日产千吨钢的高产纪录；接着，河南省又创造了日产万吨钢的纪录。这些地区以土法炼钢起家的经验，受到全国各地的普遍重视，连日来，各省成批前往观摩、学习的人，络绎不绝。
    占10月份全国钢产量70％以上的十八个重点钢铁企业，这十天的钢产量比9月上旬增长了17.2％。进入10月以来，全国绝大多数炼钢厂，面临着一个新的课题：土铁中含硫、磷和其他杂质较多，但是必须用这些土铁炼出好钢来。各炼钢厂的职工群众，以不折不挠的精神，想尽一切办法，夜以继日地和土铁中的各种有害杂质作顽强的斗争。冶金工业部及时在天津召开了现场会议，交流和推广了在这方面已经取得的经验。
    全国生铁的平均日产量，10月份头十天比9月上旬增加了111.6％从目前起到今后相当长的时间内，摆在全国钢铁大军面前两个急迫的问题是，努力提高生铁质量；及时把大量生铁从千千万万个极其分散的冶炼点上运出来；以满足炼钢的需要。
    10月份对完成今年一千零七十万吨钢的计划带有决定性的意义。但是，上旬钢铁生产增长的速度还没有达到预期的要求，这就给中、下旬带来了更加繁重的任务。现在可以越来越明显地看出，钢铁生产大跃进，不只是钢铁工业本身的事，而交通运输、煤炭供应以及机械制造、电力、地质勘探等工作，都必须及时跟上来，协作配合，缺一不可。有关领导部门要求战斗在钢铁战线上的大军，采取一切措施，充分发挥各重点企业原有炼钢炉的生产潜力；要使新建转炉赶快投入生产和正常生产；迅速掀起土法炼钢的群众运动高潮；并且要把非冶金工业系统的一切冶炼设备动员起来，投入炼钢的行列。
