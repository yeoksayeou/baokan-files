The story of the "miracle doctors" is spreading everywhere near Riryong Station in Songchon County, North Korea. Who are these "miracle doctors"? They are none other than Comrade Luo Zhaotai and Comrade Guo Xinglun, medical orderlies from a hospital affiliated with the Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They used acupuncture to cure many illnesses for the Korean people. From September 17th to 30th alone, they treated 1,449 people, many of whom had traveled specifically from two or three hundred li away.

These two Volunteer Army soldiers, who enlisted in 1956, diligently studied logistics and learned acupuncture techniques from books. Within three months, they enabled a mute person who hadn't spoken for many years to speak, cured an old man who had suffered from stomach pain for many years, and helped a woman with infertility to become pregnant. Therefore, the Korean people all call them "miracle doctors," saying that acupuncture is even more effective than "elixir." A few hours before returning to China, Luo Zhaotai and Guo Xinglun went to the homes of patients in their residency to treat them. The Korean people were so moved that they shed tears and gave them many gifts such as apples, chestnuts, and toothbrush bags to express their gratitude. When they politely declined, the Korean people quietly put the gifts in their backpacks.

Now, although they have returned to China, the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people will forever remain in people's hearts. (Attached pictures)

Thirteen-year-old Korean child Huang Zhongshan was deaf and mute from a young age. After four acupuncture treatments by Guo Xinglun, he can now hear and speak simple words. The picture shows Guo Xinglun teaching him to speak.

    “神医”的故事
    新华社讯　在朝鲜成川郡里岭车站附近到处传颂着“神医”的故事。“神医”是谁呢？原来是志愿军后勤部所属某医院的卫生员罗朝泰、国兴伦二位同志。他们用针灸的办法给朝鲜老百姓治愈了许多病。仅在9月17日到30日之间，他们就治疗了一千四百四十九人次，其中有许多病人是特意从二、三百里地外赶来的。
    这两位1956年入伍的志愿军战士，到部队后勤学苦钻，从书本上学会了针灸的方法。在三个月内，他们把多年不会说话的哑吧治得会说话了，把肚子痛了多年的老大爷治得不疼了，把患不育症的妇女治得怀孕了。……因此，朝鲜人民都称他们为“神医”，说：针灸比“仙药”还灵。在回国前的几小时，罗朝泰、国兴伦还到驻地各病人家给患者看病。感动得朝鲜老百姓流着热泪送给了他们许多苹果、栗子、牙具袋等礼物，表示感谢，当他们婉言谢绝时，朝鲜人民便把礼物悄悄地装在他们背包里。
    现在，他们虽然回国了，但中朝人民之间的深厚友谊却永远留在人们的心里。（附图片）
