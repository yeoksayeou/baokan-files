    Our Literature Enters a New Period

    In June and July, I traveled for two months to the provinces of Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China, where I investigated the mass literary movement in factories and rural areas, and visited worker and peasant authors, as well as writers and poets who live among them. These visits gave me an extremely profound and vivid impression: almost all factories and rural areas are filled with a fervent artistic atmosphere, everywhere is full of poetry and song, and everywhere there are workers' and peasants' own literary organizations and various artistic activities. The unprecedented upsurge of the mass literary movement has emerged very naturally. Because in that overwhelming Great Leap Forward in production, in the heroic labor competitions, the masses urgently need to use literary forms to express their irrepressible enthusiasm for labor and creation. A worker in Sichuan said, "Where there is labor, there is poetry." This is a simple but philosophical saying. It shows that people's literature is born from labor, and the current high tide of mass literature shows the process of combining labor and culture, or labor and poetry. This combination is the main content of the current socialist cultural revolution in our country.

    When I was in Wuhan, I learned that each of the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan has more than 30,000 worker-peasant creative groups. In Sichuan, it is estimated that there are more than one million worker-peasant writers. The situation in other provinces is roughly the same. Many of these creative groups were organized by the masses themselves and then developed under the leadership of local cultural organizations and propaganda agencies. The cultural level of farmers has improved significantly in recent years, and illiteracy has been greatly reduced. Amateur middle schools and even universities for farmers have been established in rural areas. Most rural areas have cultural stations, clubs, libraries, and broadcasting stations, which are their places for cultural activities. Most of the people who participate in the creative groups have published their works in local newspapers, periodicals, or wall posters. As for the number of people who create orally, it is even impossible to calculate. Their main forms of creation are poetry, as well as novels, dramas, and other folk art forms. The number of mass poems is difficult to count, often tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands in a single county. This is not only because poetry is the most suitable form for expressing their labor enthusiasm, but also because there is a long tradition of folk songs among the working people of our country. Many farmers have the talent for composing impromptu poems. Currently, there are many such "poetry villages" in our country, with the walls or doors of the village houses covered with poems and paintings created by the farmers themselves. Comrade Guo Moruo once used the lines "Ten thousand fruit trees are planted in the garden, and ten thousand poems are written all over the walls" to describe a poetry village in Hebei Province. When I was in Xi'an, I also visited such a poetry village. It was a small village with only more than 500 people, but more than 200 people were able to write poetry. On each household's door, there was a foot-square piece of chalk, on which was written the best poem from the family, signed with their name. In the center of the village, there was a poetry contest stage, with large poetry posters and pictures posted. These were the most popular works selected from all the farmers in the village. This poetry contest stage was the place where they held poetry contests. Since this spring, they have held three poetry contests here, where farmers recited their own new works. When I went to visit them, they immediately held a small poetry meeting in the courtyard of the agricultural cooperative director. More than a dozen farmers, including children from thirteen or fourteen years old to old men and old women in their sixties and seventies, all composed impromptu poems on the spot. It was a very touching scene. From the sound of their recitation and their shining eyes, you could feel very truly their love for the new socialist life, without the slightest bit of affectation. One folk song said: "Tailoring clothes must start from the collar, singing must come from the heart." Indeed, their poems are sung from the bottom of their hearts. They told me about the origin of this poetry contest. This spring, when irrigating the wheat fields, a female production team leader felt the need to use poetry to express her labor emotions and relieve physical fatigue, so she was the first to sing, and then many farmers working in the fields followed suit, thus forming a village-wide style of writing poetry. They said, "For us, writing poetry is the best way to relieve physical fatigue and improve labor enthusiasm." This is a very meaningful sentence. Among the working people, their creation and labor are always inseparable.

    Currently, the mass poetry movement has become the most widespread literary trend in the country. This trend has had a huge impact on the creation of Chinese poets. It has opened up a new path for Chinese new poetry. Farmers said to poets in their poems:
    Where to find excellent poems?
    Advise poets to go to the countryside.
    The mountains and fields change every day,
    What isn't touching?
    Break the old rules, people are united,
    Heroes everywhere create miracles.
    Myths and poems are everywhere,
    Why don't poets quickly pick them up?
    From the thousands of poems of the masses, we can see some of its characteristics. First, as mentioned earlier, these poems are closely linked to labor, and the real labor emotions they express are not easy to read in the poems of intellectuals; second, these poems universally express a kind of extremely majestic, heroic spirit and optimism. They proudly said: "We want to use lakes and marshes as ink ponds, and use big trees as pens, to write beautiful poems on the rivers and mountains of the motherland." They despise all the difficulties of nature, despise the heroes in ancient history or mythology. This is a great communist style.
    The forms of their poems harmoniously express the rhythm of labor and the characteristics of the Chinese people's language, so they are easier to spread than the poems of intellectuals. The language of their poems is very concise, clear, and full of imagery. This is the excellent tradition of Chinese folk songs and classical poetry, and it has been accepted by them. For example, there is a poem called "Wheat Sea":
    Golden sky, golden mountain,
    Golden light shining red sky.
    Brother enters the field, only face is exposed,
    Daddy enters the field, waist disappears.
    Grandma enters the field, falls into the sea,
    Golden waves roll and submerge me.
    I hold my breath, jump three times,
    Still haven't touched the wheat tip.
    Only eight lines of poetry, but how vividly it depicts the scene of the wheat harvest season and the joy of bumper harvest. For many years, the issue of the form of Chinese new poetry has been debated. In this mass poetry movement, a clear direction has been found, that is, the new songs of China should be developed on the basis of our country's folk songs and classical poetry, should adopt national forms, and in terms of method, should combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.

    In factories and mines, the mass literary movement is also developing vigorously. In Shanghai alone, one million mass creations were produced this spring, most of which were written by workers. Among the workers in Tianjin, a factory history writing movement is underway. This is to accept the experience left to us by Gorky. Workers use collective writing methods to record the history of struggle and heroic deeds of their own factories in the form of reportage. This experience was immediately promoted to other regions of the country. When I was in Wuhan and Chongqing, workers in many factories had already begun to plan and compile. In some factories that I visited, there were workers' literary organizations and literary publications. Almost every workshop has a creative group. Like in the countryside, the walls are covered with mass poems. The cultural level of workers is higher than that of farmers, and the forms of their creation are more extensive. In addition to poetry, they also wrote a large number of novels, essays, scripts, and various folk art forms. Most of these works describe their current life struggles, and some describe the painful life before liberation and the struggle for revolution. These works have a great inspiring and educational effect on the working masses. A cotton mill in Tianjin held a factory history exhibition. Many workers were very moved after seeing it. The next day, the rate of substandard cloth in cotton cloth production was greatly reduced. There are many such stories. A factory cadre said, "For us, literature and art are not only a kind of spiritual power, but also a material force, because it directly helps our factory's production increase."
    Our country is a country with vast regions and many ethnic groups. The folk literary forms of various ethnic groups and regions are extremely diverse. For example, there are dozens of local opera types and other folk literary forms in Sichuan Province alone. In ethnic minority areas, such as Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guangxi, there are beautiful literary works of their own ethnic groups, including pastoral songs, legends, or epic narrative poems. Most of these works have strong romantic colors. This kind of ethnic and local art often shows a unique local style. This is also a characteristic of mass art. The diversified development of national characteristics and local styles will greatly promote the better combination of socialist content and national forms in our country's literature. The high tide of the mass literary movement further proves the correctness of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy put forward by the Party two years ago. A scene of colorful flowers blooming in the soil of the broad working masses has appeared.
    Once the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses are brought into play, its power is unimaginable. Currently, the nationwide communist ideological emancipation movement is being launched, advocating the communist style of daring to speak, dare to think, dare to do, dare to create, and dare to innovate. The Party's general line for socialist construction fully embodies this spirit. On the new social foundation, the subjective initiative of the people has been greatly improved. The various miracles that have appeared in the Great Leap Forward in production and culture, and the vigorous atmosphere that has appeared in culture and art, can only be explained by this reason. For literature and art, this ideological emancipation is especially an important factor in promoting creativity. During my trip, I often heard or encountered some touching things and people. For example, in Hunan, there is a 31-year-old farmer named Liu Yong, who plans to write 1,400 works, read more than 6 million words of newspapers and magazines, and work 200 workdays this year. When he goes to the fields every day, his pockets are full of literary journals and books. Rest and sleep time is his time for creation and reading. He also leads a creative group. The works of himself and other members of the creative group must go through collective discussion by the creative group before they are published. Isn't this high degree of enthusiasm and selflessness worth learning from intellectuals? In Chongqing, I met an old worker in a machinery factory who was blind and unable to work, so he devoted himself to writing with all his strength. He has been writing for seven or eight years and has organized a training class to train young Quyi (a general term for various kinds of Chinese folk singing and ballad performance) workers. He told me an interesting story. Recently, one night, he wrote dozens of lines of poetry, but when he showed it to others the next morning, there were only seven characters on the manuscript paper. It turned out that the ink in his pen had dried up. He said heroically: "These difficulties cannot overwhelm me. I can write with a pencil, write with a stone pen. I will always write, and I will also apply to return to the production post." Such stories can be encountered everywhere. Among the masses, some talented and determined worker-peasant authors are constantly emerging. In the near future, there will undoubtedly be a group of outstanding and truly working-class writers and poets emerging from among them.

    We should fully estimate the significance of the worker-peasant mass literary movement. This is the germ of communist literature. Although these mass creations are still in their infancy, they are the healthiest and most vital literature directly produced from labor life, and they are the literature that inherits the excellent traditions of ancient Chinese literature. This literary movement further promotes the close combination of writers and the working masses, promotes the combination of popularization and improvement of literature, and provides new content in the creative method of socialist realism.
    The anti-rightist struggle carried out in our country's literary and art circles last year was a struggle between the two roads of proletarian and bourgeois literature. The victory of this struggle made the writers more deeply appreciate the importance of the combination of writers and the working masses. Since last winter, a large number of writers have gone deep into factories, rural areas, and troops for a long time under the call of the Party. Especially after the Great Leap Forward in production and culture, the enthusiasm of the writers has been further encouraged. Up to now, more than 700 writers across the country have participated in labor training and served in grassroots work among the masses. This is a big change compared with the way that general writers used to adopt, such as visiting or short-term life experience. The previous method was difficult to completely solve the problem of the combination of writers and the masses. The purpose of writers going deep into life is not only to observe life and find themes, but more importantly, to make their thoughts and feelings mingle with the working masses, to breathe the same air, share the same fate, and be closely linked with the masses, which requires writers to live among the masses for a long time, participate in certain labor training and mass work. A socialist writer is not only a person who specializes in writing, but also a person who directly works for the masses, an ordinary working people. We often say, "We are the sons of the working people." If a son of the working people, a person who uses literature to express the life of the working people, does not directly participate in the production and struggle practice of the working people, and does not have the experience and knowledge of labor life, how can he more deeply express the thoughts and feelings of the working people and more truly portray their spiritual outlook in creation? We believe that this is a fundamental issue of socialist and communist literature.
    When I was in Wuhan and Chongqing, I visited several writers. Their common experience is that after participating in certain physical labor, even if this labor is relatively easy or not much time is spent, the relationship between workers and farmers and them is completely different from the past. They regard you as a member of themselves, talk to you about everything, and become close friends. Before this, although they respected you as a writer, they often only regarded you as a visitor or guest, and there was always some distance in emotion. Therefore, they believe that participating in certain labor training and grassroots work is the basic key to solving the true combination of writers and the masses. Of course, this does not mean that the contradiction between physical labor and mental labor can be completely eliminated at present. This can only be achieved in a communist society; but the distance of this contradiction can and should be gradually shortened at present. The participation of writers in labor and the participation of the working masses in literary activities represent the process of mutual combination of literature and art and labor. This is an inevitable trend on the road of human culture towards communism. The absolute isolation between mental labor and physical labor caused by the private ownership system in the past many generations will begin to be broken. Gorky said: "Only when hands teach the brain, and then the smarter brain teaches the hands, and the smarter hands once again promote the development of the brain more powerfully, can the development process of human social culture develop normally." The cultural development process from socialism to communism is such a normal development process.

    The combination of writers and the masses also promotes the combination of literary popularization and improvement. A writer in the life of the masses cannot but more clearly consider how his works can be understood and accepted by the broad masses, and cannot but consider how he can serve the mass literary movement.
    The high tide of the mass literary movement has brought a strong and fresh whirlwind of people's heroism to creation. The people demand the strongest voice of the times, and hate and despise the garbage of revisionists who distort reality and describe darkness. Therefore, the slogan of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism was put forward in the creative method - this was put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Never have I seen the people so spiritually invigorated, full of fighting spirit, and full of vigor." To reflect such a heroic era in literature, we cannot but require the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism as our main method in creation. Of course, this revolutionary romanticism is based on reality, and is the combination of ideal and reality, just as the people's invigorating spirit, high fighting spirit, and striving will are produced from their fiery struggle life. This revolutionary romanticism, I think, is the reflection in literature of the people's great ideals of communism, their indomitable communist heroic spirit and optimism, and their high degree of creativity and imagination in the process of socialist construction. In our surrounding boiling life, everywhere is full of this revolutionary romantic spirit. The task of writers is to use artistic methods to not only faithfully depict their life appearance, but also fully express the people's striving spirit and their ideals and wishes.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's poems are the most outstanding examples of the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. In these poems, they are full of the lofty spirit and heroic spirit of communists, expressing the beautiful fantasies of revolutionaries. This is an outstanding expression of the communist style. In many folk songs at present, this spirit is also reflected.
    The combination of romanticism and realism, this feature is also reflected in Chinese classical literature. From Qu Yuan, Sima Qian, Li Bai, Du Fu, and later novels and dramas such as "Water Margin", "Journey to the West", "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Investiture of the Gods", "Legend of the White Snake", "Generals of the Yang Family", "Dream of the Red Chamber" and other works, they all created extremely numerous beautiful images that combine ideal and reality, fantasy and reality. These images, especially the images of people's heroes, are extremely familiar and loved by generations of Chinese working people. Any ordinary farmer can casually say a long list of typical figures of people's heroes, and in the current mass poems, they often cite many ancient heroes, expressing their desire to surpass them. Some of the most prominent images in our country's literature are those people's heroes with a spirit of fearlessness. This is an excellent tradition in the history of our country's literature.
    This situation can also be seen in the recent literary trends in our country. All works that can better express the people's heroism are sure to be welcomed by the broad masses of people. Novels such as "Defend Yan'an", dramas such as "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains", movies such as "Dong Cunrui", operas such as "Liu Hulan", and reportage such as "Dedicate Everything to the Party" are all the most beloved works of the masses, while those so-called "exposing the darkness" works touted by revisionists are angrily denounced by readers. Especially in the past year, this clear color of people's heroism in literature has become more prominent. In this year, China has produced more excellent works than in the past few years, such as "Red Flag Score", "Tracks in the Snowy Forest", "Red Sun", "Bitter Vegetable Flowers", "Song of Youth", "Steel Forged", "Great Changes in the Mountain Village", "In the Days of Peace", "Red Storm", etc., all of which are warmly loved by the broad masses of readers. This is not only because these works describe the life of the people's struggle, but more importantly, they express the revolutionary heroic spirit of the Chinese people and have the color of revolutionary romanticism. "Red Flag Score" and "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" are especially loved by the masses among these works, and the main reason is here. "Red Flag Score" describes the revolutionary struggle in the Chinese countryside for more than 30 years. Through three generations of grandparents and grandchildren fighting stubbornly with the landlords and bullies, they finally set off a revolutionary storm under the leadership of the Communist Party. From the stories full of blood and tears, the author wrote about the tenacious and unyielding character of our country's farmers, which is also the most precious character of the Chinese people that Comrade Mao Zedong said. "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" describes a small detachment of the People's Liberation Army fighting the enemy in the sparsely populated and dangerous forest and snowfield. The author focuses on portraying the wit and bravery of the people's soldiers. The work has a strong legendary color and national style. Although the life description is not as deep as "Red Flag Score", it has a special bright tone and heroic spirit, thus arousing a more general love from readers.
    These two authors are all newly emerging writers. The reason why they have been successful is because they have experienced the struggle life of the masses for a long time. Although there may be deficiencies in art, they have firmly grasped the most essential things in the people's life. This once again proves the truth that writers cannot be separated from the struggle life of the masses.
    What the people like and dislike is an important factor in determining the direction of creation. The slogan of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism is put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the characteristics and needs of the times and summarizing all the experiences in literary history. We believe that this is an important issue in the socialist realism method.
    The unprecedented high tide of the mass literary movement, the close combination of writers and the masses and labor, and the high praise of the revolutionary romantic spirit in creation can be said to be the characteristics of our country's literature in the past year. These characteristics show that our country's literary movement is entering a new period. It will carry out continuous innovation and creation on the widest and most solid foundation of the working masses and improve the level of our country's literature. These creations and innovations will not only have a decisive impact on the development of our country's socialist and communist literature, but also, we believe, will make a meaningful contribution to the world's revolutionary literary cause.

    我们的文学进入了新的时期
    （本文系作者应苏联“新时代”杂志之约而作，这里发表的，是征得作者同意作了一些删节。——编者）
    邵荃麟
    6、7月间，我到中南、西南和西北各省，作了两个月的旅行，考察了工厂、农村中的群众文学运动，访问了工人和农民的作者以及和他们生活在一起的作家和诗人。这些访问，给我一个极其深刻和生动的印象：几乎所有工厂和农村中都充满着热烈的文艺气氛，到处都是诗和歌声，到处都有工人农民自己的文学组织和各种文艺活动。群众文学运动的空前高涨是很自然地出现的。因为群众在那种排山倒海的生产大跃进中，在英雄主义的劳动竞赛中，迫切地需要用文艺形式来表达他们那种难以遏制的劳动创造热情。四川有个工人说：“哪里有劳动，哪里就有诗。”这是一句平易然而却富于哲理的话。这是说明人民的文艺是从劳动中产生的，目前群众文学高涨的形势是显示着劳动与文化，或者劳动与诗相结合的过程。这种结合也就是当前我国社会主义文化革命的主要内容。
    我在武汉的时候，知道江西、湖南、湖北、河南各省，每省都有三万个以上的工人农民的创作组。在四川，据人们估计，有一百万以上的工农写作者。其他各省情况也大致相同。这些创作组很多是群众自己组织起来，然后在当地的文化团体和宣传机关领导下发展的。农民的文化水平在这几年中，有了显著的提高，文盲大大减少了，各地农村中都举办了农民的业余中学以至大学。大多数农村中都有文化站、俱乐部、图书室、广播站这些组织，这就是他们的文化活动的场所。参加创作组的人，多半是在当地的报纸、刊物或墙报上发表过作品，至于口头创作的人数，那更无法计算了。他们创作的主要形式是诗歌，也有小说、戏剧和其他民间文艺形式。群众诗歌的数量是难以统计的，往往一个县就是几万以至几十万首。这不仅因为诗歌是最适合于抒唱他们劳动热情的形式，而且也因为我国劳动人民中间是有悠久的民歌传统。很多农民都有作即兴诗的才能，目前我国有许多这样的“诗村”，在村庄的墙壁或门户上，贴满了农民自己创作的诗和画。郭沫若同志曾经用“万株果树种满园，万首诗歌写满墙”的诗句，描写了河北省一个诗村。我在西安的时候，也访问了这样一个诗村。那是只有五百多人口的一个小村庄，但却有二百多人能够做诗。在每一家门口，都有一块一尺见方的白垩，写着这一家人中间最好的诗，签着自己的名字。在村子的中心，有一个赛诗台，贴着大幅的诗报和图画。这是从全村农民中挑选出来的最受欢迎的作品。这个赛诗台是他们举行赛诗会的场所。今年春天以来，他们在这里举行过三次赛诗会，由农民朗诵他们自己的新作。当我去访问他们的时候，他们立刻在农业合作社主任的院子里，举行了一个小型的诗会，十多个农民，包括从十三、四岁的孩子，到六、七十岁的老汉和老妈妈都当场做了即兴诗。这是一个非常感动人的场面。从他们朗诵的声音和发亮的眼睛中，使你极其真切地感到他们对于社会主义新生活的热爱，完全没有一点矫揉做作。有一篇民歌中这样说：“裁衣要从衣襟裁，唱歌要从心里来。”确实，他们的诗歌是从心底里唱出来的。他们告诉我这个赛诗会的缘起。今年春天灌溉麦田的时候，有一个女生产队长感到要用诗歌来表达她的劳动感情和解除体力的疲劳，于是她第一个唱起来了，接着许多在田间劳动的农民，也就跟着唱起来，这样就形成了全村做诗的风气。他们说：“做诗，对于我们来说，是解除体力疲劳和提高劳动干劲的最好方法。”这是一句很有意义的话。在劳动人民中间，他们的创作和劳动总是分不开的。
    目前，群众诗歌运动已经成为全国的最广泛的一个文学潮流。这个潮流对中国的诗人的创作产生了巨大的影响。它给中国新诗开拓了一条新的道路，农民在诗歌中对诗人说：
    优秀诗篇哪里寻
    奉劝诗人下农村
    山川田野天天变
    哪件事情不动人
    打破陈规人心齐
    处处英雄创奇迹
    遍地神话遍地诗
    诗人何不快快拾
    从群众的千千万万的诗篇中，我们可以看到它的一些特征。首先，如前面所说，这些诗歌是和劳动紧密地结合着的，它们所表现的真实的劳动感情，是知识分子的诗歌中所不易读到的；其次，这些诗歌普遍地表现出一种极其雄伟、豪迈的气概和乐观主义的精神。他们骄傲地说：“我们要用湖沼作墨池，用大树作笔杆，在祖国的河山上，写出美丽的诗篇。”他们藐视一切自然界的困难，藐视古代历史或神话中的英雄。这是一种伟大的共产主义的风格。
    他们诗歌的形式和谐地表现出劳动的节奏和中国人民语言的特色，因此比起知识分子的诗歌更易于流传，他们诗的语言很简练、明朗而又富于形象。这是中国民歌和古典诗词的优良传统，而被他们接受下来。例如有一首“麦海”：
    金黄天　金黄山
    金光闪闪染红天
    哥哥进地只露脸
    爹爹进地腰不见
    奶奶进地跌下海
    金浪滚滚把俺淹
    我闭住气、跳三跳
    还没摸着麦梢梢
    仅仅八行诗，却多么生动地描写出麦收时节的景象和丰产的欢乐。多年以来，中国新诗的形式问题一直在论争着，在这次群众诗歌运动中间，却找出了一个明确的方向，就是说，中国的新歌，应该在我国民歌和古典诗词的基础上发展，应该采取民族的形式，在方法上应该是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合。
    在工厂矿山中间，群众文学运动也同样蓬勃地发展着。上海一市，今年春天就产生了一百万篇群众创作，其中绝大部分是工人所写的。在天津工人中间，正在开展一个工厂史写作运动。这是接受高尔基遗留给我们的经验。工人采用集体写作的方法，用报告文学的形式记录下他们自己工厂的斗争历史和英雄人物事迹。这个经验立刻被推广到全国其他地区。我在武汉、重庆的时候，许多工厂的工人已经在开始计划编写了。在我所访问过的一些工厂中间，都有工人的文学组织和文学出版物。每个车间几乎都有一个创作组。和农村一样，在墙壁上贴满了群众的诗歌。工人的文化水平要比农民高，他们创作的形式也就更加广泛。除了诗歌以外，他们也写了大量的小说、散文、剧本以及各种民间文学形式的作品。这些作品大多是描写他们当前的生活斗争，也有描写在解放前的痛苦生活和为革命斗争的。这些作品对工人群众产生了很大的鼓舞教育作用。天津市有家棉纺厂举行了工厂史展览，许多工人看了以后十分感动，第二天棉布生产中的次布率就大大降低了，这类故事很多。有个工厂干部说，“文艺，对于我们，不仅是种精神力量，而且也是物质力量，因为它直接帮助了我们工厂的增产”。
    我国是个地区广阔和多民族的国家，各民族和各地方的民间文学形式是极其多样的。譬如四川省的地方剧种和其他民间的文学形式就有几十种之多。在少数民族地区，如新疆、内蒙古、西藏、云南、广西等地，都有其本民族的优美文学作品，包括牧歌、传说，或史诗形式的大叙事诗，这些作品大都具有强烈的浪漫主义的色彩。这种民族的和地方形式的文艺往往表现出独特的地方风格。这也是群众文艺的一个特点。民族特色、地方风格的多样化的发展，将大大促进我国文学上社会主义内容与民族形式更好的结合。在群众文学运动高涨中，更证明党在两年以前所提出的百花齐放的方针的正确性。在广大劳动群众的生活土壤上，一个万紫千红百花怒放的景象出现了。
    群众的积极性和创造性一旦发扬起来，它的力量是难以想像的。现在全国正在展开共产主义思想解放运动，提倡敢说、敢想、敢做，敢于创造，敢于革新的共产主义风格。党的社会主义建设总路线就充分体现这种精神。在新的社会基础之上，人民的主观能动作用大大提高了。生产和文化大跃进中所出现的各种奇迹，文化艺术上所出现的蓬勃气象，只能用这个理由来说明。对于文学艺术来说，这种思想解放尤其是促进创造性的重要因素。在我的旅行中间，经常听到或碰到一些令人感动的事情和人物。譬如在湖南有个三十一岁的农民刘勇，他今年计划要写一千四百篇作品，读六百多万字的书报杂志，要工作二百个劳动日。他每天下田的时候，口袋里装满了文学刊物和书籍。休息和睡觉的时间，就是他创作和阅读的时间，他还领导了一个创作组。他自己和其他创作组成员的作品，都要经过创作组的集体讨论然后发表。这种高度干劲和忘我精神，难道不值得知识分子学习吗？在重庆，我碰到一个机械厂的老工人，双目失明，不能干活了，他就用全力来从事写作。他已经写了七、八年，并且组织了一个训练班来培养青年的曲艺工作者。他告诉我一个有趣味的故事。最近一个晚上，他写了几十行诗，第二天早上给别人看时，稿纸上面只有七个字。原来他的钢笔里的墨水干了。他豪迈地说：“这些困难是压不倒我的。我可以用铅笔写，石笔写，我将永远写下去，而且我还要申请回到生产岗位上去。”这样的故事到处可以遇到。在群众中间，不断在涌现出一些有才能有决心的工农作者，在不久的将来，毫无疑问将从他们中间产生出一批杰出的真正工人阶级的作家和诗人。
    我们应该充分估计工农群众文学运动的意义，这是共产主义文学的萌芽。尽管这些群众的创作目前还在萌芽的时期，但却是直接从劳动生活中产生出来的最健康最有生命力的文学，并且是继承了中国古代文学中优秀的传统的文学。这个文学运动更进一步促使作家与劳动群众的密切结合，促进了文学的普及与提高的结合，并且在社会主义现实主义的创作方法上提供了新的内容。
    去年我国文艺界所进行的一场反右派斗争，是一场无产阶级与资产阶级文学两条道路的斗争。这个斗争的胜利使作家们更深刻地体会了作家与劳动群众结合的重要性。去年冬天以来，大批作家在党的号召下，长期地深入到工厂、农村、部队中去。特别是生产和文化大跃进以后，更鼓舞了作家的积极性。到现在为止，全国已经有七百多个作家在群众中参加劳动锻炼和担任基层工作。这和过去一般作家所采用的那种访问式的或短期的体验生活方式相比较，有了很大的改变。过去那种方式是很难彻底解决作家与群众结合的问题的。作家深入生活的目的，不仅是为了观察生活，找寻题材，更主要是为了使自己的思想感情和劳动群众打成一片，做到和群众共呼吸，同命运，心心相连，这就要求作家长期地生活在群众中间，参加一定的劳动锻炼和群众工作。一个社会主义的作家不仅仅是一个专门拿笔杆的人，同时也应该是为群众直接工作的人，一个普通的劳动人民。我们常常说，“我们是劳动人民的儿子”，一个劳动人民的儿子，一个以文学来表现劳动人民生活的人，如果不是直接参加劳动人民的生产和斗争实践，没有劳动生活的经验和知识，他又怎样能够在创作上更深刻地表现出劳动人民的思想感情和更真实地描绘出他们的精神面貌呢？我们认为这是社会主义、共产主义文学的一个根本性的问题。
    我在武汉和重庆的时候，访问了几位作家。他们一个共同的经验，就是在参加一定的体力劳动以后，即使这种劳动是比较轻易的，或者时间不多的，工人、农民对他们的关系，就和过去完全不同了。他们把你看成他们自己中间的一分子，跟你无所不谈，做亲密的朋友。而在这以前，他们虽然尊重你是一个作家，但是往往只是把你看作一个访问者或客人，感情上总有若干距离。因此他们认为参加一定的劳动锻炼和基层工作是解决作家与群众真正结合的基本关键。自然这不是意味着，在目前就能够完全消灭体力劳动与脑力劳动的矛盾。这只有在共产主义社会中才能实现；但是这种矛盾的距离在目前是完全可以而且应该逐渐缩短的。作家的参加劳动和劳动群众的参加文学活动，是表示着文学艺术与劳动互相结合的过程。这是人类文化走向共产主义的道路上必然的趋势。多少世代以来，私有制度社会中所造成的精神劳动与体力劳动的绝对隔离状态将开始打破了。高尔基说过：“只有在两手教导头脑，随后聪明一些的头脑教导两手，以及聪明的两手再度更有力地促进头脑发展的时候，人类的社会文化的发展过程才能正常地发展起来。”社会主义到共产主义的文化发展过程，就是这样一种正常发展的过程。
    作家与群众的结合，也促进了文艺普及与提高的结合。一个作家在群众生活中，不能不更明确地考虑到他的作品怎样能够为广大群众所理解和接受，也不能不考虑他怎样为群众文艺运动服务。
    群众文艺运动的高涨，给创作上带来了一股强烈的、新鲜的人民英雄主义的旋风。人民群众要求时代的最强音，憎恶和唾弃修正主义者那种歪曲现实描写阴暗的垃圾。因此，在创作方法上提出了革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的口号——这是毛泽东同志提出来的。毛泽东同志说：“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”要在文学上反映出这样一个英雄主义的时代，在创作上就不能不要求以革命浪漫主义与革命现实主义相结合作为我们主要的方法，当然，这种革命浪漫主义是建立在现实的基础之上，是理想与现实的结合，正如人民群众那种振奋的精神、昂扬的斗志、奋发的意志是从他们火热斗争的生活中产生出来的一样。这种革命浪漫主义，我以为就是人民群众在社会主义建设过程中，对于共产主义的远大理想，他们那种一往无前的共产主义英雄气概与乐观主义精神，以及那种高度的创造性和想像力在文学上的反映。在我们周围的沸腾生活中，到处都充满着这种革命浪漫主义精神，作家的任务就是用艺术的方法，不但忠实地描写出他们的生活面貌，并且要充分表现出人民群众这种奋发昂扬的精神和他们的理想与愿望。
    毛泽东同志的诗词，就是这种革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的最卓越的典范。在这些诗词中间，充满了共产主义者崇高的精神和英雄气概，表现了革命者的美丽的幻想。这是共产主义风格的杰出表现。在目前许多民歌中间，也反映了这种精神。
    浪漫主义和现实主义的结合，这种特征也同样表现在中国古典文学中。从屈原、司马迁、李白、杜甫以及后来的小说戏剧如“水浒传”、“西游记”、“三国演义”、“封神榜”、“白蛇传”、“杨家将”、“红楼梦”等作品中都创造了极其众多的理想与现实、幻想与真实相结合的优美的形象。这些形象尤其是人民英雄的形象，是为世世代代的中国劳动人民所极其熟悉和喜爱的。任何一个普通农民都能够随口说出一大串人民英雄的典型人物，而在目前的群众诗歌中，他们常常引喻了很多古代英雄，表示要超过他们。在我国文学中最突出的一些形象，就是那些具有大无畏精神的人民英雄。这是我国文学史上一个优良的传统。
    近年以来的我国文学倾向中，也可以看到这种情况。凡是愈能表现出人民英雄主义的作品，一定受到广大人民的欢迎。像小说“保卫延安”、剧本“万水千山”、电影“董存瑞”、歌剧“刘胡兰”、报告文学“把一切献给党”，都是群众最喜爱的作品，而修正主义者所吹嘘的那些所谓“暴露黑暗”的作品，则受到读者愤怒的痛斥。特别这一年来，文学上这种人民英雄主义的鲜明色彩更加突出了，这一年间，中国产生了比过去几年更多的优秀作品，像“红旗谱”、“林海雪原”、“红日”、“苦菜花”、“青春之歌”、“百炼成钢”、“山乡巨变”、“在和平的日子里”、“红色风暴”等等，都受到广大读者的热烈喜爱，这不仅因为这些作品描写了人民斗争的生活，更主要的是表现出中国人民那种革命英雄主义的精神，具有革命浪漫主义的色彩。像“红旗谱”、“林海雪原”这两部作品，是这些作品中尤其为群众所喜爱的，其主要原因就在这里。“红旗谱”描写了三十多年来中国农村中的革命斗争，通过祖孙三代前仆后继地和地主恶霸顽强搏斗，终于在共产党的领导下，掀起了革命的大风暴。作者从血泪斑斑的故事中，写出了我国农民那种坚韧不屈的性格，也就是毛泽东同志所说的中国人民最宝贵的性格。“林海雪原”描写人民解放军一个小分队在人烟稀少、地势险要的林海雪原上和敌人战斗。作者着重地刻划了人民战士的机智和勇敢。作品具有一种强烈的传奇色彩和民族风格，虽然在生活描写上不如“红旗谱”深刻，但却具有一种特殊的明朗色调和豪放气概，因而引起读者的更普遍的爱好。
    这两位作者，都是新出现的作家。他们之所以获得成功，就是因为他们长期地经历了群众的斗争生活，尽管在艺术上或有不足之处，但是他们却紧紧地抓住了人民生活中最本质的东西。这再一次证明了作家与群众生活斗争不能分离的真理。
    人民喜爱什么，不喜爱什么是决定创作方向上的一个重要因素。革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的口号，就是毛泽东同志根据时代的特点和需要，概括了文学史上的全部经验而提出来的。我们认为这是社会主义现实主义方法上一个重要问题。
    群众文学运动的空前高涨、作家与群众和劳动的紧密结合以及创作上革命浪漫主义精神的高扬，可以说是这一年来我国文学上的特色。这些特色说明了我国文学运动正在走入一个新的时期，它将在最广泛、最坚实的劳动群众基础上，进行不断的革新和创造，提高我国的文学水平。这些创造和革新，不仅对于我国社会主义、共产主义文学的发展将产生决定性的影响，并且，我们相信，它对世界革命文学事业也将作出有意义的贡献。　1958年8月
