Rapeseed Should Compete with Grain and Cotton
This Year's Sowing Area Expanded by 40%, and Quality Generally Improved

(Our report) The work of sowing winter rapeseed is being carried out intensely in rapeseed producing areas. To have rapeseed's production increase speed catch up with grain and cotton, and to jointly achieve a greater leap forward with grain and cotton, is the main battle objective of these regions for planting rapeseed this year. While expanding the rapeseed planting area, all localities are actively improving sowing quality, laying a reliable foundation for a bumper harvest and a great leap forward.

According to information from relevant departments, the major rapeseed-producing areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and fourteen other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions plan to plant over 62 million mu of winter rapeseed this year, an expansion of over 40% compared to last year. Currently, Shaanxi and the provinces in the Yangtze River basin have entered the busiest period of sowing. Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, and ten other provinces and municipalities have already planted over 15.6 million mu. Sichuan Province, with the fastest progress, has already completed its sowing plan of 6.5 million mu. The sowing work in southern provinces such as Yunnan and Guizhou has also begun. Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and regions will start sowing in early November.

This year, in sowing rapeseed, all localities have generally implemented yield-increasing measures centered on deep plowing of the land, heavy fertilization, close planting, and the use of improved varieties. In Sichuan Province and the Hanzhong area of Shaanxi Province, rapeseed fields are generally deep-plowed to a depth of one chi (Chinese foot, approx. 1/3 meter) or more. In Sichuan Province, the base fertilizer applied per mu of rapeseed has reached 50,000 to 60,000 jin (25-30 tons), in Guizhou Province it reached over 20,000 jin (10 tons), and in some areas of Hubei Province it also reached 50,000 jin (25 tons), an increase of several times compared to the past. All localities are also actively expanding the planting area of Victory Rapeseed and other local superior varieties. In order to meet the requirements of close planting, the amount of seeds sown in various places is generally doubled compared to the past. At the same time, all localities have generally paid attention to cultivating large areas of high-yielding fields. For example, the 60,000 mu of rapeseed sown in winter in Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, will take measures such as deeper plowing, more fertilization, and complete sowing of improved varieties to ensure an average yield of 3,000 jin per mu.

Raising rapeseed seedlings and transplanting them is an effective method of increasing production. According to past experiences in various places, under the same conditions, it generally increases production by more than 10% compared to direct sowing; at the same time, it can also solve the contradiction that late-season double-cropping rice leaves fields late, making it impossible to sow in a timely manner or only allowing hurried sowing without time for deep plowing. Therefore, this year, various localities have expanded the area for raising seedlings and transplanting them. The planned area for raising seedlings and transplanting them in Jiangsu Province will reach about 80%, in Zhejiang Province it will account for 70%, and in Sichuan and Anhui provinces it will account for more than half. At present, provinces in the Yangtze River basin have already raised more than 950,000 mu of seedlings.

In order to strive for a greater leap forward in rapeseed production, many regions and people's communes immediately strengthened field management after the directly sown rapeseed or seedling fields were finished.

According to information from various places, planting more and planting well are the main trends in rapeseed planting this year. However, the sowing plan has not been well implemented in some areas; some areas do not plan to deep-plow the land before sowing. These problems that affect the completion of the sowing plan and quality have already attracted the attention of local leaders, and measures are being taken to vigorously improve them.

    油菜要和粮棉竞赛
    今年播种面积扩大40％质量普遍提高
    本报讯　油菜产区播种越冬油菜的工作已经紧张展开。让油菜的增产速度赶上粮棉，和粮棉共同实现更大跃进，是这些地区今年种植油菜的主要战斗目标。各地在扩大油菜种植面积的同时，都积极提高播种质量，为大丰收大跃进奠定可靠基础。
    据有关部门了解，油菜主要产区江苏、安徽、浙江、陕西等十四个省、市和自治区，今年计划冬种油菜六千二百多万亩，比去年扩大40％以上。目前，陕西和长江流域各省已经进入播种大忙时期。湖北、四川、安徽、湖南等十个省、市已种一千五百六十多万亩。进度最快的四川省已经完成了六百五十万亩的播种计划。南方的云南、贵州等省播种工作也已开始。福建、广东、广西等省、区将在11月上旬开播。
    今年各地在播种油菜中，一般都贯彻了以深翻土地为中心的多肥、密植和采用良种等增产措施。四川省和陕西省汉中地区的油菜田都普遍深耕一尺以上。四川省每亩油菜施基肥达到五、六万斤，贵州省达两万斤以上，湖北省有些地区也达到了五万斤，比以往增加了几倍。各地还积极扩大胜利油菜和当地优良品种的种植面积。为了达到密植要求，各地的下种量一般都比过去增加了一倍左右。同时，各地还普遍注意了培育大面积丰产田。如贵州省江口县冬播的六万亩油菜，即采取耕得更深、施肥更多、全部播种良种等措施，保证平均亩产达到三千斤。
    油菜育苗移栽是一项行之有效的增产办法。据各地以往的经验，在同等条件下，一般都比直播的增产一成以上；同时，它还能够解决双季晚稻腾田较晚不能适时播种或只能匆忙播种无暇深耕的矛盾，因此，今年各地都扩大了育苗移栽的面积。江苏省育苗移栽面积计划达到80％左右，浙江省要占70％，四川、安徽两省都占一半以上。目前，长江流域各省已经育苗九十五万多亩。
    为了力争油菜产量实现更大跃进，很多地区和人民公社在直播的油菜或苗田种完之后，立即加强了田间管理。
    据各地了解，多种、种好是今年种植油菜的主流。但有的地区播种计划还没有很好贯彻下去；部分地区不打算深翻土地就要下种。这些影响播种计划的完成和质量的问题，已经引起当地领导上的重视，正在采取措施大力改进。
