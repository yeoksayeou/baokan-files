The Great Result of the Boundless Wisdom and Soaring Enthusiasm of Hundreds of Millions of People:
Half of the Country's Cultivated Land is Under Irrigation
Let's Engage in a Big Campaign Again This Winter and Next Spring to Greatly Increase Irrigated Area and Improve Engineering Standards

    This newspaper reports that under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialism, hundreds of millions of people worked hard through the winter and vigorously through the spring, making agricultural irrigation construction take the lead in the great leap forward of industry and agriculture, achieving unprecedented great success. At present, the country's irrigated area has reached one billion mu, accounting for more than half of the country's total cultivated land area and more than one-third of the world's total irrigated area. In just one year, the country expanded its irrigated area by 480 million mu. This is a miracle in the history of world irrigation.
    The Ministry of Agriculture, in its communique on the achievements of agricultural irrigation in 1958 (full text on page 3), specifically stated the above achievements: In the agricultural irrigation construction year from the beginning of October last year to the end of September this year, the proportion of irrigated area in the country's total cultivated land area jumped from 31% in September 1957 to 59.5%; the area of ​​depression transformed for flood control was 210 million mu; the area under preliminary soil and water conservation control was 300,000 square kilometers; 100,000 kilowatts of new rural hydropower stations and 180,000 horsepower of water power stations were built; and a total of 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were completed.
    Since last winter, agricultural irrigation construction has played a huge role in this year's flood prevention and drought resistance struggle, reducing the disaster area and mitigating the degree of disaster, and began to create the possibility of agricultural production basically avoiding general water and drought disasters, enabling agricultural production to develop relatively stably. It is estimated that due to large-scale water conservancy projects, effectively resisting water and drought disasters, this year's grain loss was reduced by approximately 30 billion to 40 billion jin; at the same time, the rice planting area in the twelve northern provinces (regions) and cities expanded by more than 17 million mu, and the area of ​​dry land converted to paddy fields in the south also greatly developed, turning many historical low-yield disaster areas into rice granaries. Agricultural irrigation construction, combined with increased production measures such as fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, has enabled China to achieve unprecedented bumper harvests in crops such as grain, cotton, and oil this year.
    According to the recent instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on water conservancy work, the country will launch a larger water conservancy construction upsurge this winter and next spring, striving to basically realize the irrigation of the country's existing cultivated land and ensure stable and bumper agricultural production. To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture called on all localities to adapt to the development of the people's commune movement in the water conservancy construction upsurge this winter and next spring, continue to expand the irrigated area, and improve the drought resistance and flood control standards of various water conservancy facilities according to the conditions of different regions. Preliminary plans: In 1959, the irrigated area should be expanded by 500 million mu, the flood control area should be 72.81 million mu, the area under preliminary soil and water conservation control should be increased by 500,000 to 700,000 square kilometers, and new rural hydropower stations with a power generation capacity of 3.5 million kilowatts should be built. The Ministry of Agriculture's communique also emphasized the need to seize technical reforms in water conservancy construction, especially to seize the two key points of tool improvement and improved operating techniques, to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the huge task of water conservancy construction.

### 亿万人民无穷智慧和冲天干劲的伟大结晶  全国耕地一半水利化  今冬明春再来一个大干特干，猛增灌溉面积，提高工程标准

    亿万人民无穷智慧和冲天干劲的伟大结晶
    全国耕地一半水利化
    今冬明春再来一个大干特干，猛增灌溉面积，提高工程标准
    本报讯　在社会主义总路线的光辉照耀之下，亿万人民苦干一冬、大干一春，使农田水利建设在工农业大跃进中一马当先，取得了史无前例的巨大成就。当前全国的灌溉面积已达到十亿亩，占全国耕地总面积二分之一以上，占世界灌溉总面积三分之一以上。短短一年之中，全国共扩大了灌溉面积四亿八千万亩。这是世界水利史上的奇迹。
    农业部在1958年农田水利成就公报（全文见第三版）中公布上述成就时具体说明：从去年10月初到今年9月底的农田水利建设年度中，灌溉面积在全国耕地总面积中所占的比例，由1957年9月份的31％跃升到59.5％；洼改治涝面积二亿一千万亩；水土保持初步控制面积三十万平方公里；新建农村水电站十万瓩，水力站十八万马力；完成土石方总量五百八十亿公方。
    去冬以来的农田水利建设，在今年防汛抗旱斗争中，发挥了巨大作用，缩小了成灾面积，减轻了灾害程度，开始创造了农业生产能够基本上避免一般水旱灾害的可能，使农业生产能够比较稳定地发展。据估计，由于大修水利，有效地抗御了水旱灾害，今年减少了粮食损失约三百亿斤到四百亿斤；同时北方十二省（区）市水稻种植面积扩大了一千七百多万亩，南方旱地改水田的面积也有很大发展，很多历史上的低产灾区变成了米粮川。农田水利建设结合肥、土、种、密等各项增产措施，使我国今年粮、棉、油料等作物，都获得了空前大丰收。
    根据中共中央最近关于水利工作的指示，今冬明春全国还将掀起更大的水利建设高潮，争取使全国现有耕地基本实现水利化，保证农业生产稳定丰收。为此，农业部号召各地在今冬明春水利建设高潮中，要适应人民公社化运动的发展，继续扩大灌溉面积，并根据不同地区条件，提高各项水利设施的抗旱防涝标准。初步规划：1959年要扩大灌溉面积五亿亩，治涝面积七千二百八十一万亩，增加水土保持初步控制面积五十至七十万平方公里，新建具有三百五十万瓩发电能力的农村水电站。农业部公报中还强调要抓紧水利建设中的技术改革，特别要抓紧工具改良和提高操作技术两个关键，以保证兴修水利巨大任务的提前和超额完成。
