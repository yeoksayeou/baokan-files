Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th: The leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Logistics Department boarded trains at 10:45 this morning to return home, amid a warm send-off from the Korean people.

This morning, both sides of the road, extending more than ten *li* from the Logistics Department leadership's residence to the train station, were lined with Korean people who had come to see them off. At 9:00 a.m., over two thousand Korean people held a farewell ceremony in the station square. Comrade Seo Gi-jun, Chairman of a certain county committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Kim Geon-tae, a representative of the People's Army, and General Zhang Bufeng, head of the Logistics Department, all spoke. They said: The fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, cemented with blood, flows endlessly like the Yalu River and remains evergreen like the pines of Mount Paektu. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's voluntary withdrawal from Korea fully demonstrates that the people of China and Korea have the power to stop aggression and safeguard peace. If the American aggressors dare to launch a war of aggression, they will surely be beaten bloody by the people of China and Korea. After the farewell ceremony, the people seeing them off and the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers held a grand song and dance party, and they were reluctant to part with each other until the train slowly started.

For more than half a month, many Korean people have been bringing gifts such as apples and pears to the Logistics Department's leadership to see off the officers and soldiers. An old mother in her fifties, Jiang Shanshu, traveled more than twenty *li* to give the two rings that her mother gave her when she got married to Sun Xuezhi, the director of the outpatient department, as a souvenir. Choi's mother also entrusted the logistics leadership to bring two "Rose of Sharon" plants to Luo Shengjiao's mother.

The leadership of the Logistics Department was also warmly seen off by the Korean Central People's Representative Delegation, the People's Army Representative Delegation, and a certain provincial representative delegation. The accompanying art troupe gave the officers and soldiers a wonderful performance.

During this period, the heads and officers and soldiers of the Logistics Department also conducted extensive farewell activities with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. They gave silk banners and a large number of sports equipment, teaching supplies, and farm tools, tables and chairs made by the officers and soldiers to the local Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 10th: For the past two days, the people of Andong have warmly welcomed the subsequent units of the third group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning home.

On the 8th, when the leadership of the subsequent units arrived in Andong, they were warmly welcomed by Wang He, Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other party and government leaders and hundreds of people.

Since September 26, the people of Andong have been rushing to the station day and night to welcome the returning heroes. The Andong City Peking Opera, Ping Opera Troupe, and Art Work Troupe still rushed to the station after the end of the performance in the evening to conduct consolation performances for the "most lovable people." Factories, schools, and streets have also prepared entertainment programs to have parties with the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers. (Attached picture)
