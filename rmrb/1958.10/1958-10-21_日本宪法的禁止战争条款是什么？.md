A reader asks:

    Kishi Nobusuke, the Japanese Prime Minister who is willing to act as a pawn for the American aggressors, openly clamored in an interview with an American Broadcasting Company reporter that "the time has come to abolish the clauses in the (Japanese) Constitution regarding the prohibition of war." What are the "clauses regarding the prohibition of war" that Kishi Nobusuke is preparing to revise?
                                From Fengtai Readers Wang Yiwen and Song Feng

    Answer: The current Japanese Constitution was promulgated on November 3, 1946, and implemented on May 3, 1947. At that time, Japanese militarism, having been defeated in the war, did not dare to openly raise its head, so this constitution, to a certain extent, reflected the Japanese people's strong desire for peace. The preamble of the Japanese Constitution reads: "We, the Japanese people, desire enduring peace, being deeply conscious of the high ideals controlling human relationship, and we have determined to rely for our security and survival upon the justice and faith of the peace-loving peoples of the world."

    The "clauses regarding the prohibition of war" that the Kishi Nobusuke government has openly expressed its intention to revise are Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. This article states: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

    Since Japan established a disguised army called the "Police Reserve Force" (now called the "Self-Defense Forces") in July 1950, and especially after the Kishi Nobusuke government intensified its implementation of an imperialist policy of following the United States in hostility towards China, the Japanese Constitution has become a thorn in the side for the Japanese reactionaries who are trying to accelerate the remilitarization of Japan, and for the American imperialists, the backers of the Japanese reactionary forces. As early as 1953, when US Vice President Nixon visited Japan, he bluntly asked the then-Yoshida government to revise the "clauses regarding the prohibition of war" in the Constitution. In 1954, the United States again instigated the Yoshida government to complete the plan to revise the Constitution by the end of 1955. After the Kishi Nobusuke government came to power, it established the "Constitutional Research Council" on August 13, 1957, which previous cabinets had failed to form, to specifically discuss how to revise the Constitution. Kishi Nobusuke merely publicly stated to an American reporter his intention to revise the "clauses regarding the prohibition of war" in the Constitution; he had already been carrying out this revision activity.

    The Japanese people have waged and are still actively engaged in a heroic struggle to uphold the Constitution. More than one hundred Japanese mass organizations have formed the "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution." The Japanese Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and all Japanese people who love peace and national independence are firmly opposed to revising the peace clauses in the Constitution. Last November, the "Asahi Shimbun" conducted a public opinion poll, which showed that the majority of people opposed revising Article 9 of the Constitution, and the number of people who opposed it had increased significantly compared to two years ago.

### 日本宪法的禁止战争条款是什么？

    日本宪法的禁止战争条款是什么？
    问：甘心充当美国侵略者马前卒的日本首相岸信介，在同美国广播公司记者的谈话中公然叫嚣说，“取消（日本）宪法中关于禁止战争的条款的时机已经到来”。岸信介准备修改的“关于禁止战争的条款”是什么？
                                丰台读者　王以文　宋　峰
    答：日本现行宪法公布于1946年11月3日，1947年5月3日实施。当时，日本军国主义在战争中遭到失败后还不敢公然抬头，所以这部宪法在一定程度上反映了日本人民强烈要求和平的愿望。日本宪法序言中写着：“日本国民，愿望恒久的和平，深知支配人类相互关系之崇高理想，决意信赖爱好和平诸国民之公正及信义，维持我等之安全与生存”。
    岸信介政府公开表示要修改的“关于禁止战争的条款”，是日本宪法的第九条。这一条是：日本国民诚实希望以正义及秩序为基调之国际和平。所谓国权发动之战争与武力之威吓及行使，永久予以废弃，不作为解决国际纷争之手段。为达到前项目的计，不保持陆海空军及其他战力。不承认国家之交战权。”
    从1950年7月日本成立了称为“警察后备队”（现称“自卫队”）的变相军队以后，特别是在岸信介政府加紧执行追随美国敌视中国的潜在的帝国主义政策以后，日本宪法对于竭力加紧日本重新军国主义化的日本反动派说来，对于日本反动势力的后台老板美国帝国主义说来，都已成为一个眼中钉。美国副总统尼克松早在1953年访问日本时，就曾露骨地要当时的吉田政府修改宪法中的“关于禁止战争的条款”。1954年，美国又曾策动吉田政府在1955年年底以前完成修改宪法的计划。岸信介政府上台以后，曾于1957年8月13日成立了历届内阁未能组成的“宪法调查会”，具体讨论如何修改宪法。岸信介只不过是对美国记者公开道出了他准备修改宪法中“关于禁止战争的条款”而已，这种修改活动他早已在进行了。
    日本人民为维护宪法曾进行过并且仍在积极展开英勇的斗争，日本一百多个群众团体组成了“拥护宪法国民联合会”。日本社会党和共产党以及所有爱好和平和民族独立的日本人民，坚决反对修改宪法中的和平条款。“朝日新闻”去年11月曾举行一次民意测验，结果表明多数人反对修改宪法第九条，而且反对的人比两年前有显著增加。
