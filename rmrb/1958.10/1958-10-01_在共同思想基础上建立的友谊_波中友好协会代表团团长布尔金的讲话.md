Dear Comrades and Friends:

	On the occasion of the National Day of the People's Republic of China, I would like to extend the warm congratulations of the Polish-Chinese Friendship Association and all circles of Poland to the Chinese people. Nine years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the working people of China established a new people's country—the People's Republic of China—and began socialist construction.

	Although the feudal comprador government left the Chinese people with a very backward economy and culture, socialist construction has developed at a speed unprecedented in human history. Nine years is a very short time in history, but in this short period, the Chinese people have been able to change the face of China beyond recognition. China has transformed from an economically backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. The speed of development, whether in industry or agriculture, has broken all world records. In the recent period, the People's Republic of China will not only surpass the United Kingdom in terms of total industrial output, but also the United States.

	In terms of agricultural production, China is currently ranked first in the world. In improving the living standards of the working people, healthcare and sanitation, as well as science, culture, and education, the Chinese comrades have accomplished extraordinary revolutions.

	The period when imperialism could unscrupulously interfere in China's internal affairs is gone forever. Now, China is a world power, and no one can impose their will upon it. These are all facts.

	Joining the great China in the socialist camp, together with the first and most powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, ensures that the strength of the socialist peace camp exceeds that of the capitalist world and is a guarantee of world peace.

	Therefore, the National Day of the People's Republic of China is a festival for all progressive mankind fighting for peace and friendship among nations. At the same time, the friendship and brotherly cooperation between Poland and China are also consolidating and developing, as evidenced by the increasing economic, scientific, and cultural ties between the two countries.

	Unlike before the war, our country is no longer isolated. It is now a member of the great socialist family of nations. Friendship and alliance based on the ideas of Marxism-Leninism unite Poland with these countries. Therefore, the friendship and alliance between Poland and China are unbreakable. In terms of foreign policy, the Polish people, having learned from the tragic war experiences of the past, demand the relaxation of international tensions and the defense of peace.

	Therefore, Poland proposed the "Rapacki Plan" to establish a nuclear-free zone in Europe. Therefore, Poland resolutely condemned the US and British intervention in the Middle East in the past, and now condemns the US occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the coastal islands.

	Poland believes that the tension in the Far East is the result of the United States pursuing a policy of disregarding the existence of the great power, the People's Republic of China, and supporting a handful of Chiang Kai-shek's thugs. The US should be particularly condemned for concentrating armed forces in the Taiwan area, as this is a threat to peace. Interfering in the internal affairs of the Chinese people and infringing upon China's territorial waters and airspace is an infringement upon the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and is contrary to the UN Charter and the principles of international law. The Polish people resolutely support the People's Republic of China in occupying its rightful place in the United Nations and resolutely support China's legitimate demands to recover Taiwan and the coastal islands, which have belonged to China since ancient times.

	The Polish people are watching with admiration and surprise the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction, in the Great Leap Forward, in industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and in the movement to establish people's communes.

	On the occasion of China's National Day, the Polish people hope that the Chinese people will achieve further and greater achievements.

	Long live the great 600 million Chinese people!
	Long live the fraternal Communist Party of China!
	Long live the Government of the People's Republic of China!
	Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Poland and China!
	Long live the friendship and brotherly alliance between the powerful socialist camp countries!
	Long live world peace!
	Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China!

### 在共同思想基础上建立的友谊  波中友好协会代表团团长布尔金的讲话

    在共同思想基础上建立的友谊
    波中友好协会代表团团长布尔金的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    值此中华人民共和国国庆之际，我谨代表波中友好协会和波兰各界转达波兰人民对中国人民的热烈祝贺。九年前中国劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下建立了新的人民国家——中华人民共和国，并开始了社会主义建设。
    虽然封建买办政府给中国人民遗留下非常落后的经济和文化，然而社会主义建设仍以人类历史上从未有过的速度发展着。九年在历史上是很短的，可是中国人民能在这短短期间里把中国的面貌改变得使人不能认识。中国已从经济落后的农业国变成为工业农业国，无论在工业上或农业上的发展速度，都打破了所有的世界纪录。在最近时期内，中华人民共和国在工业总产量方面不仅会超过英国，而且也会超过美国。
    在农业生产方面，目前中国已居世界第一位。在提高劳动人民生活水平，保健和卫生，以及科学、文化和教育等方面，中国同志们已完成了不平凡的革命。
    帝国主义能肆无忌惮地干涉中国内政的时期已一去不复返了。现在，中国是一个世界强国，谁也不能把自己的意愿强加在它的身上，这些都是事实。
    参加在社会主义阵营中的伟大中国同第一个、最强大的社会主义国家苏联在一起，保证了社会主义和平阵营的力量超过于资本主义世界，而且是世界和平的保证。
    所以中华人民共和国的国庆是为各国人民之间和平友好而斗争的全体进步人类的节日。同时，波中两国的友好与兄弟般的合作也在巩固和发展，波中两国之间的经济、科学和文化越来越多的联系证明了这一点。
    与战前不同，我们国家已不是孤立的了。目前它是伟大的社会主义各国大家庭中的一个成员。建立在马克思—列宁主义思想基础上的友谊和联盟，把波兰和这些国家团结在一起。因此，波兰同中国之间的友谊和联盟是牢不可破的。在对外政策方面，波兰人民接受过去悲惨的战争经验教训，要求缓和国际紧张局势和保卫和平。
    因此，波兰提出了在欧洲建立无原子区的“拉帕茨基计划”。因此，波兰过去坚决谴责美英在中东的干涉，现在谴责美国占领中国领土台湾和沿海岛屿。
    波兰认为，远东局势的紧张，是美国执行漠视伟大的强国中华人民共和国的存在，并支持一小撮蒋介石暴徒的政策的结果。特别应该谴责美国在台湾地区集结武装力量，因为这是对和平的威胁。干涉中国人民的内政以及侵犯中国领海和领空是侵犯中华人民共和国的主权，是与联合国宪章和国际法原则相违背的。波兰人民坚决支持中华人民共和国在联合国占有应有的地位和坚决支持中国收回自古以来就属于中国的领土台湾和沿海岛屿的合理要求。
    波兰人民以羡慕和惊喜的心情在注视着中国人民在社会主义建设方面、在大跃进中、在工业、农业、科学和文化等方面以及在建立人民公社运动中取得的巨大的成就。
    当中国国庆节的时候，波兰人民希望中国人民获得进一步的更大的成就。
    伟大的六亿中国人民万岁！
    兄弟般的中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国政府万岁！
    波中两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    强大的社会主义阵营各国间的友谊和兄弟般的联盟万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志万岁！
