　　Editor's Note:

    Write about the Harvest, Sing about the Harvest, Paint the Harvest!
    The season of great harvest has arrived. Just look, north and south of the Yangtze River, up and down the Yellow River, inside and outside the Great Wall, everywhere is filled with songs and overflowing with joy. Truly, there are endless new people and new events to write about, inexhaustible harvest songs to sing, and endless beautiful scenes to paint. We hope that authors and readers will work together, pick up their pens, and use prose, poetry, songs, ballads, stories, paintings, and all forms of art to reflect our earth-shattering great harvest, so that our people will be even more jubilant, the "onlookers" will be more sober, our friends will be happier, and our enemies will tremble even more!

    写丰收，唱丰收，画丰收！
    大丰收的季节来到了。且看那大江南北、黄河上下、长城内外，到处歌声盈耳，喜气冲天。真是写不尽的新人新事，唱不竭的丰收歌儿，画不完的良辰美景。我们希望作者和读者们一起动手，拿起笔来，用散文、诗、歌、曲艺、故事、画以及一切文艺形式来反映我们的惊天动地的大丰收，好让我们的人民更加欢腾，让观潮派更加清醒，让朋友们更加高兴，让敌人更加战栗！
