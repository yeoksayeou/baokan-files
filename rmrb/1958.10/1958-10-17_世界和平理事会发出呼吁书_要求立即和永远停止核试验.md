Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 15th: The Executive Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting here today, issued an appeal to all humanity, calling for support for the resumption of negotiations on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and demanding an immediate and permanent cessation of testing as a first step towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

The appeal stated that eight years ago, the World Peace Movement in Stockholm called upon the people to oppose atomic war and to demand a ban on weapons of mass destruction under supervision.

Today, the testing and stockpiling of these weapons pose new dangers to humanity. Scientists from various countries have clearly demonstrated the dangers of testing. Government experts from various countries meeting in Geneva have shown that stopping testing can be supervised. The Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally halt testing had generated great hope. Because the United States and Britain did not follow this example, people around the world are once again faced with a testing race. Negotiations must be resumed without delay, and they must succeed.

The appeal went on to say that all humanity is threatened, and all humanity demands an immediate and permanent cessation of testing as a first step towards the prohibition of nuclear weapons. To safeguard peace and to protect the health and future of future generations, this demand must be met.

Xinhua News Agency, October 15th: According to TASS reports: Scientists in Moscow held a gathering on the 14th, calling on foreign scientists, especially scientists from the United States and Britain, to use their scientific prestige to fully support the demand of world public opinion for an immediate and unconditional ban on the testing of all kinds of nuclear weapons.

The gathering was convened to study the results of the Third International Atomic Energy Scientists Conference. At the meeting, Soviet Academy of Sciences Vice President Topchiev, Professor Kuzin, a member of the Soviet delegation to the International Atomic Energy Scientists Conference, and others spoke. Participants unanimously expressed their support for the statement of the Third International Atomic Energy Scientists Conference.

    世界和平理事会发出呼吁书
    要求立即和永远停止核试验
    新华社布拉格15日电　世界和平理事会执行委员会今天在这里举行的会议上向全人类发出呼吁书，要求支持恢复关于停止核武器试验的谈判，要求立即和永远停止试验，作为走向禁止核武器的第一步。
    呼吁书说，八年以前，世界和平运动在斯德哥尔摩号召人民反对原子战争，起来要求在监督下禁止大规模毁灭性的武器。
    今天，试验和储存这些武器使人类遭到了新的危险。各国科学家已经清楚地说明了试验的危险性。在日内瓦开会的各国政府专家表明，停止试验是可以监督的。苏联决定单方面停止试验，曾经产生了巨大的希望。由于美国和英国没有仿效这一榜样，各国人民又一次面临了试验竞赛的局面。必须毫不延迟地重新开始进行谈判，而且必须成功。
    呼吁书接着说，全人类遭到了威胁，全人类都要求立即和永远停止试验，作为走向禁止核武器的第一步。为了维护和平和保卫后代的健康和前途，这一要求必须得到满足。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科的科学家们14日举行集会，号召外国科学家，首先是美国和英国的科学家利用他们在科学上的威望全力支持世界公众关于立即无条件地禁止试验各种核武器的要求。
    这个集会是为了研究第三次国际原子能科学家会议的成果而召开的。在集会上，苏联科学院副院长托普切夫、出席国际原子能科学家会议的苏联代表团成员库津教授等都讲了话。与会者一致表示支持第三次国际原子能科学家会议的声明。
