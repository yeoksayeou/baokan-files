To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China,
Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please allow us to express our heartfelt congratulations to you and the heroic Chinese people on our own behalf and on behalf of all the Czechoslovak people. This year has been a year of new and brilliant achievements for the Chinese people. The significant resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China have powerfully inspired the broad masses in their creative work of building their own country and strengthening the unity of the Chinese people. These great achievements and the people's extensive creativity prove that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, will enthusiastically complete the task of catching up with and surpassing Britain in the production of the most important industrial sectors in the shortest possible time; agricultural production in the countryside is also flourishing. People's communes are now being established, which fundamentally promote agricultural production and industrial upsurges, and improve the lives and cultural levels of the broad working masses—the seeds of the future communist society. This huge scale of socialist construction means a great consolidation of the People's Republic of China, and a consolidation of the internal and external strength of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving forces in their struggle against imperialism. The Czechoslovak Government and all the people fully support the struggle of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China to liberate Taiwan and other islands, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times, and resolutely condemn the American aggressive actions against the Chinese people. The Czechoslovak Government and all the people highly value the efforts made by the Government of People's China to maintain and consolidate peace, further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp countries, and implement a policy of friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence between all peoples.

The fraternal cooperation between our two countries in political, economic, and cultural fields is constantly developing. We believe that cooperation and firm friendship based on the principles of proletarian internationalism will continue to be strengthened, to the benefit of the socialist construction of our two countries.

We wish you, dear comrades, and all the Chinese people further significant achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle to consolidate world peace.

May the friendship and cooperation between the Czechoslovak and Chinese people be forever consolidated and developed.

President of the Czechoslovak Republic, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, An. Novotny
Chairman of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, Z. Fierlinger
Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Government, V. Široký
