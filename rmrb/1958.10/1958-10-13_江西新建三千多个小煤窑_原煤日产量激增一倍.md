Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang Electric Dispatch: Jiangxi Province has resolutely implemented the policy of "small-scale, indigenous methods, and mass mobilization" on the coal mining front. Since the end of September, the province's average daily raw coal output has surged to more than 20,000 tons, more than double the average daily output from January to July.

Since September, all mining areas in the province have conducted political education and large-scale debates among employees to increase coal production and support the "marshal of steel" taking office, greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the workers. The Pingxiang Coal Mine used to produce 7,000 tons of raw coal per day. After political and ideological education, more than 14,000 employees were full of energy. Around the National Day holiday, the daily output of raw coal has soared to more than 12,000 tons, and released a high-yield "satellite" of more than 13,900 tons of raw coal per day. At the same time, many special districts and counties are preparing to build small coal mines and mobilize the masses of rural communities to build their own small mine shafts. Up to now, more than 3,000 small coal kilns have been built throughout the province, distributed in more than 70 coal-producing counties. These small coal kilns produce an average of 10,000 tons per day, accounting for almost half of the province's daily raw coal output. All investments and equipment for building wells and digging coal in small coal kilns are mostly solved by mobilizing the masses using indigenous methods. If there is no money to buy wood and tools, the masses will donate them themselves; if there is no dynamite to open mountains, the masses will make their own homemade explosives; if there are no modern tools for digging coal underground, the masses will use axes to chop; and use homemade batteries to solve the lighting problem. Various places have also helped newly built small coal kilns solve the problem of insufficient technical strength through methods such as large mines leading small mines, old wells leading new wells, and masters leading apprentices.

In order to further set off a climax in coal production and ensure that the "marshal of steel" has sufficient fuel for the winter, the province has now put forward a new goal of working hard for 100 days, striving to build 10,000 small wells, and achieving a daily raw coal output of 40,000 tons.

### 江西新建三千多个小煤窑  原煤日产量激增一倍

    江西新建三千多个小煤窑
    原煤日产量激增一倍
    新华社南昌电　江西省在采煤战线上坚决贯彻小、土、群的方针，9月底以来全省原煤平均日产量已激增到两万多吨，比1月到7月份平均日产量增加一倍以上。
    9月份以来，全省各矿区都在职工中进行了提高煤产量、支援钢铁元帅升帐的政治教育和大辩论，大大激发了职工群众的干劲。萍乡煤矿过去日产原煤七千吨，经过政治思想教育后，一万四千多名职工干劲冲天，国庆节前后，原煤的日产量已猛增到一万二千多吨，并放出了日产原煤一万三千九百多吨的高产“卫星”。同时，许多专区、县都在筹办小煤矿和发动乡社群众自建小矿井。到目前为止，全省建成的小煤窑已有三千多个，分布在七十多个产煤县。这些小煤窑平均日产万吨，差不多占全省日产原煤的一半。小煤窑在建井、挖煤中的一切投资和设备，绝大部分都是发动群众用土办法解决的。没有钱买木料和工具，群众就自己献出来；没有炸药开山，群众就自己制造土炸药；下井挖煤没有现代工具，群众就用斧头砍；用土制电池解决照明问题。各地还通过大矿带小矿，老井带新井，师傅带徒弟等办法，帮助新建小煤窑解决技术力量不足的问题。
    为了进一步掀起煤炭生产高潮，确保钢铁元帅有充分的燃料过冬，现在全省又提出了苦战一百天，争取建成小井一万个，达到日产原煤四万吨的新目标。
