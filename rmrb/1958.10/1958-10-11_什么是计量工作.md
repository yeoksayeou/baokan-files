    What is Measurement Work

    People use rulers to measure the length of objects, liters and pecks to measure the quantity of objects, and scales to measure the weight of objects, all of which are called measurement. Rulers, liters, pecks, and scales are all measuring instruments. These three measurements, length, volume, and weight, are actually only a small part of the entire measurement work. With the development of industrial production and scientific research, the types of measurements have become more numerous, the accuracy higher, and the scope wider, thus requiring various types of measuring instruments. For example, in the mechanical industry, there are various measuring tools and instruments for measuring product dimensions; in the metallurgical industry, there are various instruments for measuring furnace temperature and wind pressure; in the chemical industry, there are instruments for measuring high temperature and high pressure. In addition, there are measuring instruments for measuring electricity, time frequency, radioactivity, radio waves, light waves, sound waves, and so on. Whether measuring instruments are accurate has a great impact on production and scientific research. In the mechanical industry, if the product dimensions are not accurately measured, parts cannot be interchanged or may even be scrapped; in the steelmaking and ironmaking process, if the furnace temperature and wind pressure are not accurately measured, the quality of steel will be directly affected, and it may even be impossible to produce it; in the chemical industry, if the temperature and pressure are not accurately measured, it will not only affect production but also create a risk of explosion. In order to ensure that measuring instruments are accurate and consistent and accurately used, special personnel and specialized organizations should be established from the grassroots level (factories, people's communes) to all levels of local government to manage measurement work. The central specialized management organization is the State Bureau of Metrology, which will establish various unified and highest-precision standard instruments, namely national benchmarks, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of measuring instruments throughout the country through these benchmarks. This is the main task of measurement work.

    什么是计量工作
    人们用尺来量物体的长短，用升斗量物体的数量，用秤来称物体的重量等等，都叫做计量。尺升斗秤都是计量器具。这三种计量叫度量衡，实际上只是整个计量工作的一小部分。随着工业生产和科学研究事业的发展，计量的种类更多了，精确度更高了，范围也更广了，因而需要用各种各样的计量器具。例如在机械工业方面，有测量产品尺寸的各种量具、仪器；在冶金工业方面，有测量炉温、风压的各种仪表；在化学工业方面，有测量高温高压的仪表。此外还有测量电力、时间频率、放射性、无线电、光波、声波等的计量器具。计量器具是否准确，对生产和科学研究工作影响很大。在机械工业
  上如果产品尺寸计量不准，零件就不能互换，甚至报废；炼钢炼铁过程中如果炉温和风压计量不准就直接影响钢铁的质量，甚至炼不出来；化学工业上如果温度压力计量不准不仅影响生产，而且有爆炸的危险。为了使计量器具准确一致和准确使用，从基层（工厂、人民公社）到各级地方都要有专人和专门机构管理计量工作。中央的专门管理机构就是国家计量局，它要建立各种统一的精确度最高的标准器具，即国家基准，通过这些基准来保证全国计量器具的准确一致。这就是计量工作的主要任务。
