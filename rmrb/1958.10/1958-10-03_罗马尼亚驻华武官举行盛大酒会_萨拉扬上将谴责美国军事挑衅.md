Xinhua News Agency, 2nd October: The Romanian Military Attaché to China, Lieutenant Colonel Nicu, and his wife, held a reception this evening to celebrate the Romanian People's Army Day.

Marshal Peng Dehuai and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were invited to attend the reception.

General Sălăjan, head of the Romanian military delegation visiting China and Minister of the Romanian Armed Forces, spoke first at the reception attended by over a hundred guests. After recounting the glorious combat history of the heroic Romanian People's Army, he particularly emphasized: All peace-loving people around the world are increasingly strongly condemning the American aggressive bloc's provocations against the Chinese people. American imperialism attempts to prevent the 600 million Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, but all its arrogant attempts are doomed to failure.

General Sălăjan said that the armies of all socialist countries are constantly strengthening their fraternal combat friendship. They vigilantly defend the positions of the socialist camp, and regard an attack on any one socialist country as an attack on all countries of the socialist camp, and are ready to act at any time in accordance with the principle of "One for all, all for one."

Marshal Peng Dehuai, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the most heartfelt and warm congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the heroic Romanian People's Army.

Marshal Peng Dehuai warmly praised the glorious combat path taken by the Romanian People's Army in the anti-fascist struggle, in liberating its own country, and in the sacred cause of defending the country and world peace. He deeply believed that the Romanian People's Army, which has become a modern army equipped with top-notch weapons and technology and with a high degree of political awareness, will play an important role in defending its country's socialist construction and world peace in the future.

Senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who were invited to attend tonight's reception included General Huang Kecheng, General Wang Shusheng, General Peng Shaohui, General Lai Chuanzhu, General Li Juikui, General Chen Shiju, and others, as well as Wang Yutian, Director of the Department of Socialist Countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Albanian military delegation visiting China, headed by General Baluku, the Mongolian military delegation visiting China, headed by Lieutenant General Dorji, and some members of the Bulgarian National Assembly delegation, were also invited to attend the reception. Romanian Ambassador to China, Rudenko, and diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries also attended the reception.
