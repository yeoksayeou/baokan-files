Comrade Commander Yang Yong,
Comrade Political Commissar Wang Ping,
Dear Officers and Soldiers of the Heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army,
Dear Comrades and Friends,

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completed its third phase of troop withdrawal. Finally, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is also about to leave our country.

    On behalf of the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic, as well as the people of our country, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and honor to you who have established immortal and great achievements in Korea and are about to return home.

    Today, as we bid farewell to you, we once again recall with infinite gratitude the immortal and great achievements and accomplishments of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front over the past eight years, as well as the outstanding historical facts demonstrated by the friendship between the people of Korea and China, forged in blood.

    During the most difficult period of the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War, the brave soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in order to assist us, raised the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea and came to our country, fought side by side with our People's Army, defeated the American armed aggressors, defended the freedom and independence of our people, and made great contributions to defending peace in Asia and the world.

    These facts are recorded in the glorious annals not only as the victory of the people of Korea and China, but also as the victory of peace-loving people all over the world.

    The Chinese People's Volunteer Army not only established brilliant achievements on the front lines, but also, in the post-war period, steadfastly guarded our country's outposts together with the Korean People's Army, and sincerely helped the Korean people rebuild their homes and heal the wounds of war. The proletarian internationalist spirit and lofty moral qualities you have demonstrated have deeply moved the Korean people and have been unanimously respected by all good people in the world.

    The glorious and great achievements of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, like the most touching myths, will be passed down to our descendants for generations and will forever shine brightly along with our prosperous motherland.

    Comrades, the American aggressors have forgotten the lessons of their disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, and have recently been even more blatant in carrying out aggressive actions against our two countries. The American imperialists in the southern half of our country are even more frantically clamoring for a "northward advance," and recently have been carrying out serious acts of war provocation against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area.

    If the enemy attempts to achieve their aggressive ambitions with such foolish conspiracies, then they are sorely mistaken. Times have changed, and the imperialists should soberly face this fact. The American imperialists should immediately stop their dangerous game of playing with fire, which is putting a noose around their own necks, and must get out of South Korea and Taiwan. If the enemy disregards the firm warnings of our two peoples and the unanimous protests of the people of the world, and dares to provoke a new war in the Far East, then they will surely suffer a more serious and disastrous defeat than the Korean War.

    The Korean people will consistently stand together and advance side by side with the Chinese people in the struggle against imperialist aggression and for the consolidation of peace in Asia.

    Our two countries, in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, are firmly united and are leaping forward for the victory of socialism. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Republic, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have achieved great victories in the cause of socialist construction, and are riding the Chollima towards a broader future. On this land, which you and the Korean People's Army have guarded with blood, the Korean people will build a happy socialist paradise. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people are making a great leap forward in order to catch up with and surpass Britain in the shortest possible time, and to build their country into a socialist power. The great victories achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction are an infinite encouragement to our struggle.

    Although we are parting, our hearts will always be with you. The friendship between the people of Korea and China, consolidated in the common struggle against imperialist aggression and in the construction of socialism, and united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, is immortal. I sincerely wish you new achievements in the great cause of defending the socialist construction of the Chinese people and defending peace in Asia and the world after you return home. At the same time, I hope you will convey the gratitude and respect of the Korean people to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    I propose:
    For the unbreakable friendship and unity of the people of Korea and China, for the friendship and unity between the people of all countries in the socialist camp centered on the great Soviet Union, for the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and the leading comrades of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government headed by him, for the health of the heroic officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army headed by beloved Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping, cheers!

    志愿军丰功伟绩永留青史
    崔庸健委员长在宴会上的讲话亲爱的杨勇司令员同志亲爱的王平政治委员同志亲爱的英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们亲爱的同志们、朋友们
    中国人民志愿军已经完成了第三批撤军工作。最后，中国人民志愿军总部也即将离开我国了。
    我代表朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府以及我国人民，谨向在朝鲜建立了不朽的伟大功勋，即将归国的你们，致以衷心的感谢和荣誉。
    今天，我们同你们作别的时候，再一次以无限感激的心情，回忆八年来中国人民志愿军官兵们在朝鲜前线所建立的不朽的伟大功勋和业绩，以及以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民之间的友谊显示出来的各种各样的出色的历史事实。
    在朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争最艰苦的时期，中国人民志愿军勇士们为了援助我们，高举起抗美援朝的旗帜来到了我国，和我们的人民军队并肩作战，战胜了美国武装侵略者，保卫了我国人民的自由、独立，并为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出了伟大的贡献。
    这些事实，不仅作为朝中两国人民的胜利，而且作为全世界爱好和平人民的胜利，记录在光荣的史册上。
    中国人民志愿军不仅在前线建立了辉煌功绩，在战后时期，同我国人民军一道牢固地守卫我国前哨阵地，并诚心诚意地帮助朝鲜人民重建家园、医治战争创伤。你们所发扬的无产阶级国际主义精神和崇高的道德品质，深深地感动了朝鲜人民，并受到了全世界善良人民一致的尊敬。
    中国人民志愿军官兵们所建立的辉煌的伟大的功勋，像最动人的神话一样，将流传我们的子孙万代，同繁荣的我们祖国一起，永远发出万丈光芒。
    同志们：美国侵略者忘记了在朝鲜战场上遭到惨败的教训，最近更加露骨地进行着反对我们两国的侵略行动。美帝国主义者在我们祖国的南半部，更加疯狂地叫嚣“北进”，最近又在台湾海峡地区进行反对中国人民的严重的战争挑衅行为。
    如果敌人竟企图用这种愚蠢的阴谋达到自己侵略的野心，那末他们的算盘大错特错了。时代已经变了，帝国主义者应该清醒地正视这一点。美帝国主义者应立即停止把绞索套在自己脖子上的危险的玩火行为，必须从南朝鲜和台湾滚出去。如果敌人不顾我们两国人民的坚决的警告和世界人民一致抗议，胆敢在远东挑起新的战争，那末他们一定遭到比朝鲜战争更加严重的惨败。
    朝鲜人民将在反对帝国主义侵略和巩固亚洲和平的斗争中始终如一地同中国人民站在一起并肩前进。
    我们两国在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，牢固地团结在一起，正为社会主义的胜利飞跃前进。朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的胜利，并且向着更广阔的前景跨上千里马奔驰着。在你们同朝鲜人民军在一起用鲜血守卫着这块土地上，朝鲜人民将会建设起幸福的社会主义乐园。兄弟般的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党正确的领导下，为了最短时期内赶上和超过英国，并为了把自己的国家建设成为社会主义强国，正在大跃进。中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大的胜利，无限地鼓舞着我们的斗争。
    虽然，我们离别了，但是我们的心将同你们永远在一起。在反对帝国主义侵略和建设社会主义的共同斗争中巩固起来的、在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下团结起来的朝中两国人民的友谊是永垂不朽的。我衷心地预祝你们回国以后，在保卫中国人民的社会主义建设和保卫亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业中获得新的成就。同时，我希望你们把朝鲜人民对中国人民和中国人民志愿军的感谢和尊敬，转告给中国人民。
    我建议：为朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结，为以伟大的苏联为中心的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友谊团结，为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志和以他为首的中国共产党和政府的领导同志的健康，为以亲爱的杨勇司令员、王平政治委员为首的英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵们的健康，干杯！
