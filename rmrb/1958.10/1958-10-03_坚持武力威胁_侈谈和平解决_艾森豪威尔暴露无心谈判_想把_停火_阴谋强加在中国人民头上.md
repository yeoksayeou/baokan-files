    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd of October: Washington News: Following U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, U.S. President Eisenhower also held a press conference on the 1st, persisting in the U.S. government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and expanding aggression against China. Although the two of them took turns appearing with tireless effort, they are still performing an old play that is not a hit.
    In answering questions from reporters, Eisenhower indicated that despite the U.S. government's extremely isolated position on the Taiwan Strait issue, it still wants to pursue a policy of military provocation and war threats against the People's Republic of China. When talking about Dulles' statement at the press conference on September 30th that the Chiang Kai-shek group's massive deployment of troops on the Chinese coastal islands of Jinmen and Matsu was "foolish," Eisenhower said that as a military man, he also believed that it was "not a good thing" for the Chiang Kai-shek group to station these troops there. He said that fundamentally, anyone can see that these islands are "not extremely important to Formosa (referring to Taiwan)." However, Eisenhower emphasized that Dulles' words did not mean that the U.S. policy would undergo very significant modifications. He reiterated the so-called "Formosa (referring to Taiwan) Resolution" passed by the U.S. Congress, once again threatening to use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory, and clamoring that "there must be no appeasement" when dealing with the Taiwan Strait issue.
    Eisenhower apparently also realized that the U.S. government's war threats and military provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait have placed it in a siege of domestic and foreign public opinion. Therefore, while making war-mongering noises, he also self-deceptively said that the U.S. also "sincerely hopes to find a peaceful solution" to the Taiwan Strait issue. He said with a great show of seriousness that, in America's search for a peaceful solution, there's no imaginable means which America has not carefully studied and discussed with other national governments. But he made no mention at all of the most fundamental way to eliminate tensions in the Taiwan Strait – the U.S. government withdrawing its troops from the Taiwan area. He merely repeated the cliché of a "ceasefire". He also said that if a "ceasefire" is achieved in the Jinmen area, then there will be an opportunity to seriously negotiate with China. This means that the U.S. has no sincerity in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Warsaw on resolving international disputes between China and the U.S. in the Taiwan area, but only wants to impose a "ceasefire" conspiracy on the Chinese people.
    Similarly, Eisenhower also talked about the so-called "demilitarization" of the Chinese coastal islands. But he admitted that this is not "a final answer that everyone would agree to."
    Eisenhower admitted that the U.S. has differences with its "allies" on its policy towards the Taiwan area. He said, "It should be remembered that the U.S. has differences with its allies around the world," and these differences are "sometimes very sharp." In order to get rid of the isolated situation caused by the U.S.'s policy of military provocation against China and win the support of its "allies," Eisenhower repeatedly put forward those arguments that have long been proven untenable to defend the U.S.'s aggression policy. Like Dulles, he quoted NATO Secretary General Spaak's flattering pro-U.S. remarks made in the U.S. to slander the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory as exerting "relentless pressure" on the "free world." Eisenhower even forcibly described the U.S.'s war provocation behavior on the Chinese coastal islands as safeguarding the "principles" of "Western civilization," and even went to great lengths to try to make people believe that the conflict between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is not a civil war issue.
    Eisenhower demanded that other Western countries accept his views and follow the U.S.'s brinkmanship policy in the Taiwan Strait area. He clamored for the "necessity" of Western countries taking a "firm stand" on the Chinese coastal islands issue and not retreating in the face of the so-called "communist threat".
    Eisenhower also reiterated that the U.S. government will continue to ignore the demands of broad world opinion and persist in obstructing the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

### 坚持武力威胁　侈谈和平解决  艾森豪威尔暴露无心谈判  想把“停火”阴谋强加在中国人民头上

    一套侵略滥调　两人轮流出场
    坚持武力威胁　侈谈和平解决
    艾森豪威尔暴露无心谈判
    想把“停火”阴谋强加在中国人民头上
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：紧接着美国国务卿杜勒斯之后，美国总统艾森豪威尔1日也举行了记者招待会，坚持美国政府敌视中国人民和扩大对中国的侵略政策。尽管他们两位不辞辛劳轮流出场，但串演的还是一出并不叫座的老戏。
    艾森豪威尔在回答记者提出的问题时表明，尽管美国在台湾海峡问题上的处境极端孤立，但是美国政府仍然要推行对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的政策。他在谈到杜勒斯9月30日在记者招待会上所说的蒋介石集团把大批军队集结在金门和马祖等中国沿海岛屿上是“愚蠢的”这一段话时说，作为一个军人，他也认为蒋介石集团把这些军队驻在那里“并不是一件好事情”，他说，从根本上说，任何人都可以看到这些岛屿“对于福摩萨（指台湾）并不是极为重要的”。但是艾森豪威尔强调，杜勒斯这些话并不意味着美国的政策将作非常重大的修改。他重申美国国会通过的所谓“福摩萨（指台湾）决议”，再次威胁要用武力来阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土，并且叫嚷在处理台湾海峡问题时“一定不要姑息”。
    艾森豪威尔显然也发现，美国政府在台湾海峡对中国进行的战争威胁和军事挑衅已使它自己处于国内外舆论的围剿中。所以他在发出好战叫嚣的同时又自欺欺人地说，对于台湾海峡问题，美国也“衷心希望能够找到一个和平的解决办法”。他煞有介事地说，在美国寻求和平解决的过程中，没有任何想像得到的办法是美国不曾仔细研究过并且同其他国家政府讨论过的。但是他却完全没有提到消除台湾海峡紧张局势的最根本的办法——美国政府把它的军队撤出台湾地区。他只是重弹“停火”的滥调。他还说，如果在金门地区实现“停火”，那么就有同中国认真地进行谈判的机会。这就是说，美国对于在华沙举行的中美两国大使级会谈关于解决中美两国在台湾地区的国际争端并无诚意，而只是想把“停火”的阴谋强加在中国人民头上。
    同样地，艾森豪威尔也谈到所谓中国沿海岛屿“非军事化”的问题。但是他承认，这不是“每一个人都会同意的一个最后答案”。
    艾森豪威尔承认，在对台湾地区的政策中，美国同它的“盟国”有分歧。他说，“应当记住，美国同它在全世界的盟国是有分歧的”，这些分歧“有的时候还很尖锐”。为了要摆脱美国对中国的军事挑衅政策所造成的孤立处境，争取“盟国”的支持，艾森豪威尔喋喋不休地再次提出那些早就证明站不住脚的论点，来为美国的侵略政策辩护。他和杜勒斯一样引用了北大西洋公约组织秘书长斯巴克为了向美国献媚而在美国发表的支持美国立场的谈话，诬蔑中国人民解放自己的领土的决心是对“自由世界”施加“无情的压力”。艾森豪威尔还硬把美国在中国沿海岛屿所采取的战争挑衅行为说成是为了维护“西方文明”的“原则”，甚至东拉西扯，枉费心机，企图使人相信中国人民同蒋介石卖国集团的冲突不是内战问题。
    艾森豪威尔要求其他西方国家接受他的观点，在台湾海峡地区追随美国的战争边缘政策。他叫嚷西方国家在中国沿海岛屿问题上采取“坚定的立场”的“必要性”，不要在所谓“共产主义威胁面前退却”。
    艾森豪威尔还再次表示美国政府将继续无视世界广大舆论的要求，坚持阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。
