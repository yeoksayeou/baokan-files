Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th — The full text of the farewell address delivered by Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation, to the Korean people at Pyongyang Station is as follows:

Dear Korean Comrades! Dear Brothers and Sisters!

Yesterday, you saw off the last group of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning home with unprecedented warmth, and today you are seeing us off with such enthusiasm. On behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Delegation and the entire Chinese people, I express my heartfelt gratitude.

During the Korea-China Friendship Month, we have personally witnessed that the Korean brothers and sisters, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, have achieved brilliant successes in all fields. The heroic Korean people have truly mounted the Chollima (Thousand-Li Horse) and are victoriously completing the post-war Three-Year Plan, preparing to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, thereby greatly accelerating the speed of socialist construction. On behalf of the entire Chinese people, I express my highest respect to you. The Korean people are hardworking and brave, possess a high degree of culture, and have a high degree of enthusiasm for building socialism. We fully believe that, as Comrade Kim Il-sung said, this year Korea's industrial products will be 4.7 times more than ten years ago, and when the First Five-Year Plan is completed, the output of Korea's major industrial products per capita will certainly exceed that of Japan.

Due to your great victory in agricultural collectivization, the productive enthusiasm of the farmers has been greatly stimulated. Your grain output this year will exceed the target of the last year of the First Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule. A life of abundance is already a reality. You are full of confidence to strive for a more beautiful and happy life. We wholeheartedly congratulate you!

With the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, the lives of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have greatly improved. This situation is in stark contrast to South Korea under U.S. military occupation. We have stood on the Military Demarcation Line in Panmunjom and seen that, immediately north of the line, golden rice paddies were like rolling waves, and farmers were happily harvesting; while in the south occupied by the U.S. aggressor troops, it was a wasteland. Separated by only a line, one side is a bright world, and the other is a dark and gloomy world; one side is a thriving scene of peace, and the other is a lifeless no-man's land. Dear Comrades, anyone who comes here can personally see the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors on Korean soil; and can also personally see the great contributions made by the heroic Korean people under the leadership of the Party in promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This is the most vivid and instructive material, which can profoundly educate and inspire visitors. It declares to the world that the socialist system is infinitely superior and has vitality, and that the capitalist system is inevitably moving towards decline and death. It declares to the world that peace will surely triumph over war. It declares to the world that victory belongs to the Korean people who are unremittingly striving for the peaceful reunification of their motherland!

Dear Comrades, dear Korean brothers and sisters: The Chinese People's Volunteers returning home have taken your deep friendship towards the Chinese people back to China batch after batch. We are about to return to China, and we are another batch that is returning home fully loaded with your friendship towards the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always thank you. The people under the banner of Marxism-Leninism are forever invincible! Let us encourage each other, learn from each other, help each other, go all out, build socialism, and move from one victory to an even greater victory!

Long live the heroic Korean people!

Long live the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Kim Il-sung!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged with blood!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th — Guo Moruo, Head of the Chinese People's Delegation, sent a telegram to Premier Kim Il-sung of the Korean Cabinet when he left Sinuiju to return home today, expressing his gratitude for the warm reception given by the Korean people during the delegation's visit to Korea.

The telegram said that we are returning to China with the Korean people's friendship for the Chinese people, which is as deep as the sea, and the Chinese people will never forget this.

The telegram said that we wish the heroic Korean people, who have mounted the Chollima, an early completion of the peaceful reunification of their motherland and more brilliant achievements in socialist construction under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government, and yourself.

    中国人民代表团离朝回国
    郭沫若向朝鲜人民致告别词并电谢金日成首相
    新华社平壤26日电　以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团结束了在朝鲜的访问，今天上午乘专车回国。
    平壤车站今天高悬金日成首相和毛泽东主席的画像和朝中两国国旗。车站广场上和月台上有许多拿着鲜花和旗帜的群众，他们高举着写着“朝中两国人民间的友谊团结万岁”的标语。
    今天到车站欢送代表团的有朝鲜内阁副首相金一、洪命熹、郑一龙、南日、郑准泽、李周渊，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、朴金喆、金昌满，民族保卫相金光侠大将，朝中友好协会委员长河仰天等。中国驻朝鲜大使馆人员和各国驻朝鲜的使节也到车站欢送。
    郭沫若团长在车站向欢呼着的群众致告别词。（全文另发）
    接着，郭沫若团长、甘泗淇副团长和全体团员同前来欢送的人们热烈握手告别。专车在十时半驶离平壤。
    同代表团同车前往新义州国境的有朝鲜外务省副相许国凤和中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光。
    新华社平壤26日电　中国人民代表团团长郭沫若在平壤车站上向朝鲜人民致告别词，全文如下：
    亲爱的朝鲜同志们！亲爱的兄弟姊妹们！
    昨天，你们以空前未有的热诚欢送了最后一批志愿军回国，今天你们又这样热烈地欢送我们，我代表中国人民代表团全体同志和全体中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    在朝中友好月里，我们亲眼看到了朝鲜的兄弟姊妹们，在以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，各方面都获得了光辉的成就，英雄的朝鲜人民真正是跨上了千里马，胜利地完成了战后三年计划，正在准备提前完成第一个五年计划。从而大大地促进了社会主义建设的速度。我代表全体中国人民向你们表示崇高的敬意。朝鲜人民是勤劳勇敢的，具有高度的文化，具有高度的建设社会主义事业的热情。我们完全相信，正如金日成同志所说，今年朝鲜的工业产品将比十年前多四点七倍，到第一个五年计划完成的时候，朝鲜的工业主要产品的产量，按人口比例一定能够超过日本。
    由于你们在农业合作化方面的伟大胜利，大大地发挥了农民的生产积极性。你们的粮食产量今年就将提前三年超过第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。丰衣足食的生活已经实现了。你们正充满信心为更加美满幸福生活的前景而奋斗。我们衷心地向你们祝贺！
    随着工农业生产的恢复和发展，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民的生活有了很大的改善。这种情况同在美国军事占领下的南朝鲜形成了强烈的对照。我们曾经站在板门店军事分界线上看过，在紧接军事分界线的北部，金黄的稻谷犹如起伏的海浪，农民们正在愉快地进行秋收；而在美国侵略军占领着的南部，则是一片荒芜。仅隔一条线，一边是光明的世界，一边是暗无天日的世界；一边是欣欣向荣的和平景象，一边是死气沉沉的无人区。亲爱的同志们，无论谁到这里来，都可以亲眼看到美国侵略者在朝鲜土地上所犯的罪恶行为；也都可以亲眼看到在党领导下的英雄的朝鲜人民在促进祖国的和平统一、维护亚洲和世界和平方面所作的巨大贡献。这是最鲜明的形象教材，使参观的人都可以受到深刻的教育和鼓舞。它向全世界宣告着：社会主义制度无比的优越性和生命力，资本主义制度的必然趋向于没落和死亡。它向全世界宣告着：和平一定能够战胜战争。它向全世界宣告着：胜利属于为和平统一祖国而奋斗不懈的朝鲜人民！
    亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朝鲜兄弟姊妹们：志愿军回国把你们对中国人民的深厚友谊一批又一批地带回中国去了，我们就要回中国去了，我们是又一批把你们对中国人民的友情满载而归。中国人民将永远感谢你们。在马克思、列宁主义的旗帜下的人民是永远不可战胜的！永远相互勉励，相互学习，相互援助，鼓足干劲，建设社会主义，由一个胜利走向更伟大的一个胜利！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    以金日成为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府万岁！
    中朝两国人民用鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    新华社平壤26日电　中国人民代表团团长郭沫若今天在离开新义州回国的时候，打电报给朝鲜内阁首相金日成，对朝鲜人民在代表团访问朝鲜期间所给予的热情接待表示感谢。
    电报说，我们满载着朝鲜人民对中国人民像海一样深的友情回到中国去了，中国人民对此将永志不忘。
    电报说，我们预祝跨上了千里马的英雄的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和您的领导下，早日完成祖国的和平统一，在社会主义建设中取得更光辉的成就。（附图片）
