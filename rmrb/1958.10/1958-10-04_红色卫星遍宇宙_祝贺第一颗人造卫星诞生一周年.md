Red Satellites Throughout the Universe
—Congratulations on the First Anniversary of the Launch of the First Artificial Satellite
Liang Ruhai

    We have just happily celebrated the national holiday, and we see news of the three marshals—steel, machinery, and grain—shining one after another every day, and we see the good news of a great harvest in the golden autumn. In these days filled with joyous events, we also celebrate the first anniversary of the first red satellite!

    Only a year has passed since the moment when the first artificial satellite, which shocked the world, soared into space and opened a new page in human history. A year is but a moment in the long river of human history, but what era in the past can compare with this great year?

    A month after the first satellite went into space, Comrade Mao Zedong made an accurate and eloquent assessment of the world situation in Moscow: The East Wind is prevailing over the West Wind. This sentence is not a prediction, but a statement of the current fact. More and more facts this year are proving and will continue to prove this truth day by day. The earth always advances along its fixed orbit, and history always moves forward according to its own laws. Imperialism is on its last breath, while communism is evergreen. Isn't this perfectly clear? Isn't the third satellite orbiting above our heads a witness?

    Yes, people may think of the few small satellites of the United States. To be honest, those few small marbles, besides becoming a laughing stock, no longer arouse any interest in us. When the news of the failure of the United States' recent test of a radiation satellite was published, the newspaper used a unique title: Star Sinks to the Bottom of the Sea. In fact, what sank to the bottom of the sea was not just that small marble? In that flash, the prestige of imperialism and the "good times" of the cannibals were once again reduced to ashes with a "poof." The demise of the American satellite may be temporary, and it may be successful one day, but the capitalist system is forever and ever incurable!

    Artificial satellite, you are the unparalleled victory of the socialist camp! You have opened a glorious and dazzling chapter for human history, and you have played a solemn and enthusiastic triumphal song for communism! On October 4th—a day that will forever be printed in red in history—we want to send our deep blessings and excitement to the heart of the socialist camp, the Soviet Union, to which all progressive humanity wholeheartedly aspires.

    Speaking of ourselves, our artificial earth satellite has not yet gone into space (it will sooner or later), but we have also launched our "satellites." Our daily steel production is 60,000 tons, our grain yield per mu is tens of thousands of catties, our factories are scattered like stars, our communes are blooming everywhere, our science and technology are advancing towards the world's peak, our people are versatile and resourceful, and we are constantly adding strength and wealth to our communist cause. All of these are the red satellites we have launched, and they, together with the various "satellites" launched by our brothers in the entire socialist family, are traveling in space. The waves of victory are rippling across the three oceans and seven continents, and the heroic songs fill the entire universe!

    First red satellite, you are a great beginning, you are an immortal pioneer! On your first birthday, can you feel the joy in the hearts of people all over the world?

    Red satellites are soaring and singing. The myriad rays of communism are becoming more and more vivid and closer and closer. The days of the imperialists are numbered!

    红色卫星遍宇宙
    ——祝贺第一颗人造卫星诞生一周年
    梁汝怀
    我们刚兴高彩烈地度过全民的节日，我们每天看到钢铁、机械、粮食三大元帅接二连三放异彩的消息，看到在金色的秋天里的大丰收的喜讯。就在这样的喜事连天的日子里，又来到了第一颗红色卫星的一周岁的诞辰！
    从第一颗震惊全世界的人造卫星冲上太空揭开了人类历史上新的一页的那个时刻算起，时间仅仅过去了一年。一年，在人类历史的长河里，只不过是一瞬，然而，过去又有哪个时代能比得上这伟大的一年呢？
    在第一颗卫星上天以后的一个月，毛泽东同志在莫斯科对世界形势作了准确的、雄辩的估计：东风已经压倒了西风。这句话并不是预言，而是说明当前的事实。这一年来愈来愈多的事实，一天天在证明着、而且还要继续证明这条真理。地球总是按着它固定的轨道前进，历史总是按着自己的规律向前走，帝国主义已经奄奄一息，而共产主义却是万古长春。难道这不是十分了然的事情吗？正在我们头上转着的第三颗大卫星，不就是一个证人吗？
    是的，人们也许会想起美国的那几颗小卫星。说实话，那几颗小弹子，除了成为笑柄以外，已经引不起我们的什么兴趣了。在发表美国最近一次试验放射卫星失败的消息时，报纸上用了个别致的标题：星沉海底。其实，沉下海底的岂仅是那一颗小小的弹子？就在那一闪中间，帝国主义的威风、吃人者的“良辰美景”也一起在“嗤”的一声中再一次地化为灰烬。美国卫星的殒灭也许是暂时的，它也许会有成功的一天，但是资本主义制度却是永远永远地不可救药了！
    人造卫星，你是社会主义阵营的无比的胜利！你为人类历史揭开光辉夺目的篇章，你为共产主义高奏了一曲庄严而又热情的凯歌！在10月4日——这个在历史上永远要用红色印刷的日子，我们要向社会主义阵营的心脏、全世界进步人类衷心向往的苏联，送去深深的祝福和兴奋的心情。
    说到我们自己，我们的人造地球卫星现在还没有上天（它迟早是要上天的），但是，我们也放出了我们的“卫星”。我们的钢日产六万吨，我们的粮食亩产几万斤，我们的工厂星罗棋布，我们的公社遍地开花，我们的科学技术正向世界高峰迈进，我们的人民能文能武、有勇有谋，我们每时每刻在为我们的共产主义事业增添力量，增添财富。所有这些，都是我们放出的红色卫星，它们同整个社会主义大家庭里的兄弟们放的各种各样的“卫星”一起，在太空遨游。胜利的浪涛荡漾着三大洋七大洲，豪迈的歌声充盈着全宇宙！
    第一颗红色卫星，你是伟大的开始，你是不朽的先行者！在你的一周岁诞辰的时候，你能体会全世界人民心头的欢乐么？
    红色卫星翱翔着，歌唱着。共产主义的万道霞光，愈来愈鲜艳，愈来愈临近。帝国主义者的寿命不长了！
