Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th. Shandong Province, while achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, will also exceed its target of becoming a "hundred-jin per mu cotton province." This year, the province has sown a total of 10,870,000 mu of cotton. By the beginning of this month, the first picking was basically completed. According to estimates from various regions, the total output can reach 12 million dan of ginned cotton, an increase of more than 2.3 times compared to last year; the average yield of ginned cotton per mu can reach 110 jin, an increase of two and a half times compared to last year.

The characteristics of Shandong's cotton harvest this year are large-scale abundance and clusters of high-yield "satellites." In the two special districts of Liaocheng and Heze alone, there are more than 4,700,000 mu of cotton with a yield of more than 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The counties of Gaotang, Linqing, Xiazhen, Gaomi, Caoxian, Heze, Yuncheng, Zhangqiu, and Linqing City can all achieve more than 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Linqing County, with 500,000 mu of cotton, can achieve around 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. Currently, clusters of high-yield "satellites" are taking flight in key cotton-producing areas. In Liaocheng Special District alone, there are more than 11,000 mu of "satellite" fields with a yield of more than 1,500 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The seven mu of "satellite" cotton in the Hongwei People's Commune of Gaotang County, which Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi inspected and guided, has more than 5,500 plants per mu, with an average plant height of six chi and the tallest being more than nine chi; each plant has an average of 31 fruit branches and more than 110 mature bolls and buds. The first picking alone yielded 1,031 jin of seed cotton per mu, several hundred jin higher than the highest previous yield per mu. The commune members composed a song praising: "The people's leader came to the countryside, sowing countless bags of seeds of happiness; the autumn is high and the air is clear, the cotton blossoms open, and the first picking is worth ten years of harvest." Currently, the commune members are continuing to process and manage the cotton in an effort to break through the 15,000 jin mark of seed cotton per mu.

    丰产面辽阔宽广　卫星群振翅高飞
    山东亩产皮棉110斤
    总产量可达一千二百万担　比去年增产二倍多
    据新华社济南17日电　山东省在粮食空前大丰收的同时，百斤皮棉省的计划也将超额实现。今年全省共播种一千零八十七万亩棉花。到本月上旬，头喷花已经基本拾完。据各地估算，总产量可达到皮棉一千二百万担，比去年增加二点三倍多；平均亩产皮棉可达一百一十斤，比去年增加两倍半。
    大面积丰产和高产“卫星”成群，是山东今年棉花丰收的特点。聊城、菏泽两个专区就有四百七十多万亩棉花，亩产皮棉都在一百五十斤以上。高唐、临清、夏津、高密、曹县、菏泽、郓城、章丘等县和临清市，亩产皮棉都可达到二百斤以上。拥有五十万亩棉花的临清县，今年亩产皮棉可达到三百斤左右。目前重点产棉地区成群的高产“卫星”正振翅欲飞。聊城专区亩产皮棉一千五百斤以上的“卫星”田就有一万一千多亩。刘少奇副主席视察和指导过的高唐县宏伟人民公社的七亩“卫星”棉花，每亩达五千五百多株，一般株高六尺，最高的九尺多；平均每株有三十一个果枝，一百一十多个成桃和花蕾。一次头喷花每亩就拾了一千零三十一斤籽棉，比过去最高的亩产量还高几百斤。社员们编歌颂扬说：“人民领袖下乡来，撒下幸福种籽万万袋；秋高气爽棉花开，头喷收成顶十载”。目前社员们正为力争亩产突破一万五千斤籽棉大关继续加工管理。
