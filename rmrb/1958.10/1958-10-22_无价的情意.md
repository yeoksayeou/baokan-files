    Priceless Kindness
    The night was as black as the bottom of a pot. The incessant autumn rain pattered on. Mother Li came from Heishan Banner Xing She to Anshan to see her daughter. After getting off the bus, she lost her way in the darkness. The cold weather triggered her stomach pain. At the intersection, she could no longer walk. She squatted under the street lamp, pressing her chest tightly, sweat and rain streaming down.

    The rain grew heavier, and few pedestrians were out. At this moment, Wang Zhenhong, a young tricycle worker, was riding home when he saw an old woman huddled under the street lamp at the street corner, moaning. He quickly braked and went to the old woman, saying, "Auntie, are you feeling unwell?" The old woman struggled to raise her head, pointing to her chest and saying, "Pain!" "Quick, let's go to the clinic." The old woman knew she didn't have extra money, and she hadn't found her daughter yet. As she was about to refuse, Wang Zhenhong had already carried her onto the tricycle, covered her with his cotton coat, and sped towards the clinic.

    On the way, Wang Zhenhong inquired about the old woman's worries and learned her daughter's address. After arriving at the clinic, Wang Zhenhong used his own money to register her, settled her in a ward, and then pedaled his tricycle towards 30 Youhao Street.

    Twenty minutes later, Wang Zhenhong and a female comrade stood by the old woman's bed. When the old woman saw it was her daughter, tears of gratitude welled up in her eyes. She held Wang Zhenhong's hands tightly, saying, "Young man, your kindness is something that no amount of money can buy..."

    无价的情意
    夜，黑的像个锅底。滴滴哒哒的秋雨，在下个不停。李大娘从黑山旗星社来鞍山看女儿。下车后因天黑，迷失了方向，加上天气寒冷，老人的胃痛病发作了。走到十字路口，她再也走不动了，只好蹲在路灯下面，用手紧紧地按着胸口，汗水和雨水一起往下流。
    雨越下越大，行人很少。这时，年青的三轮车工人王振洪起车回家，看到街口路灯下，一位老人蜷曲着身子，嘴里哼哼着。他急忙煞住车。走到老人跟前说：“大娘，你那儿不舒服？”老人费了好大的劲才抬起头来，指着胸口说：“痛！”“快走，到门诊部去。”老人知道自己没带多余的钱，女儿也未找到，她正想拒绝，王振洪已把她背上车，用棉袄给她盖好，飞也似地向门诊部驶去。
    路上，王振洪问明老人的心事，知道了她女儿的住址。到了门诊部后，王振洪拿自己的钱给老人挂了号，把老人安顿到病房里，然后又踏上三轮车朝友好街三十号驶去。
    二十分钟后，王振洪和一位女同志站在老人床边，老人一看是自己的女儿，眼眶里涌出感激的泪水。她紧紧握着王振洪的双手说：“小伙子，你这种情意，是花多少钱也买不到啊……”。
