Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held a national on-site promotion meeting for local steelmaking in Tianjin from the 7th to the 9th. The meeting introduced the basic measures and operational experience of Tianjin's Xinxing Steel Plant in using indigenous iron to make steel and studied and resolved several key technical and operational method issues in converter steelmaking.

Since the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, the secretaries of the provincial and municipal Party committees across the country have taken the lead, focusing on steel, and mobilized the masses, forming an unprecedented upsurge of the whole Party and the whole people running the iron and steel industry. Since September, the national pig iron production has soared, and the shortage of pig iron has been reversed. Although steel production has also increased in the past month, it is still far behind iron production. One of the reasons is that the technical problem of using indigenous iron to make steel has not been resolved. October is a crucial month, and we must organize a great leap forward in steel production and quickly solve the technical problems of indigenous iron steelmaking. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry organized an indigenous iron steelmaking industrial group in September to conduct systematic production tests at the Tianjin Xinxing Steel Plant, and it has now basically succeeded.

The meeting analyzed the implementation of the leap forward plan and future tasks. The representatives unanimously agreed that, in order to ensure the early realization of the goal of doubling steel production, we must grasp iron production with one hand and steel production with the other.

The meeting adopted a method of upholding both idealism and realism, focusing on discussing and resolving the ideological and methodological problems of indigenous iron steelmaking. Before the meeting, many technically familiar cadres had doubts, wait-and-see attitudes, and even resistance to whether indigenous iron could be made into steel. Some people believed that indigenous iron had too low silicon, manganese, and carbon content, and too high sulfur content, so it could not be desulfurized in open-hearth furnaces, and there was insufficient heat in converter blowing. At the same time, too high sulfur content could not produce usable steel. Others believed that foreign countries did not use indigenous iron to make steel in converters, and it was not in the books, so it would not work now either. The meeting pointed out that the key to solving this problem lies in giving prominence to politics, following the mass line, and engaging in creative production technology activities. We must pass a technical barrier here, but first, we must pass the ideological barrier before we can find ways to overcome the technical difficulties of indigenous iron steelmaking. The working experience of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's indigenous iron steelmaking group at the Xinxing Steel Plant broke the superstition that indigenous iron cannot be made into steel and liberated people's minds. The representatives personally saw the No. 1 converter steelmaking workshop of this factory using indigenous iron to make rimmed steel and rolling it into usable steel. At the same time, in general, they did not use ferrosilicon and aluminum to raise the temperature during blowing because the steel grade produced was rimmed steel, so there was no need to use ferrosilicon for deoxidation, and soda was not used, but dry lime was used for desulfurization instead. This reform is simple and feasible and can be widely promoted throughout the country. This fact is a powerful persuasion to those who doubt indigenous iron steelmaking. The meeting encouraged all regions to launch competitions in indigenous iron steelmaking.

The meeting put forward specific technical organizational measures for how indigenous iron can be made into steel. The first is the problem of blowing temperature. Indigenous iron contains about 0.6% less silicon and manganese than the pig iron generally required for converters, and about 1% less carbon. Therefore, using indigenous iron to make steel in converters results in a temperature that is about 180 degrees Celsius lower than using normal foreign iron. This huge temperature difference must be compensated for by raising the temperature of the molten iron and maintaining the temperature. Otherwise, it will freeze during blowing or fail to produce good steel and good ingots. At present, there are two methods of raising the temperature in various factories. One is the method commonly used in various places, which is to add a large amount of ferrosilicon and aluminum to the converter during blowing. This method is extremely unreasonable because ferrosilicon and aluminum are refined with a large amount of electricity, are very expensive, and are not available in large quantities at present. Using them in large quantities is an extremely large waste, especially adding ferrosilicon to the converter, which has a serious erosive effect on the furnace lining and affects the service life of the furnace lining. Another method is the method created by the indigenous iron steelmaking group at the Xinxing Steel Plant. The basic measure is to increase the hot blast stove in the iron melting furnace to increase the temperature of the molten iron in the iron melting furnace. Generally, a simple tubular hot blast stove is used to raise the hot blast temperature to about 300 degrees Celsius, which has a great effect. In addition, in the operation of the iron melting furnace, measures such as appropriately increasing the coke ratio, reducing the ash content of the coke, and heating the iron melting furnace forehearth can also be taken to increase the temperature of the molten iron. Adopting top blowing and slag retention operations in converter operation also has a significant effect on raising the blowing temperature. Improving production organization and minimizing delays in the operation process to avoid heat loss are also important measures to strive for and maintain temperature.

The second important technical problem of indigenous iron steelmaking is the struggle against high sulfur. Sulfur is a harmful impurity in steel. Indigenous iron generally contains 0.2% to 0.7% sulfur, or even as high as 1% to 3% or more, which is several to dozens of times higher than the pig iron used in general converters. Too much sulfur will make the steel brittle, especially brittle when red hot, making it difficult to process. To use this high-sulfur indigenous iron to make good steel, various desulfurization measures must be taken. The basic measure is that the iron melting furnace of the converter should use an alkaline iron melting furnace, which is convenient for using alkaline slag with high desulfurization ability to desulfurize during the iron melting process. According to the results of the Xinxing Steel Plant's experiment, this can desulfurize 50% to 70% in the iron melting furnace, with a maximum of about 80%. At present, most of the iron melting furnaces in various places, except for a few, have acidic linings. In order to facilitate desulfurization, the iron melting furnaces should be changed to alkaline. The method of changing only requires changing the furnace lining of the melting zone of the iron melting furnace to dolomite bricks or other alkaline refractory materials. However, using an alkaline iron melting furnace for desulfurization requires increasing the coke ratio and also requires increasing the temperature. Therefore, hot blast should be used at the same time when changing the alkaline iron melting furnace, so that the dual effects of raising the temperature and desulfurizing can be achieved. In individual areas where the sulfur content in indigenous iron is particularly high, the sulfur cannot be reduced to the required level during iron melting and blowing. In this case, if the molten iron and molten steel temperatures are high enough, lime, fluorite, etc. can also be added to the molten iron ladle and molten steel ladle for desulfurization. Blowing lime in the forehearth and using electric furnace and open-hearth furnace slag for desulfurization in large factories also have certain effects and can be used as auxiliary methods.

The third important technical problem of indigenous iron steelmaking is the problem of homogenization of indigenous iron composition. Indigenous iron comes from all directions, and the output of each indigenous furnace is small, and the composition changes greatly. Therefore, when using indigenous iron to make steel, it is necessary to fully estimate the impact of changes in pig iron composition on converter operation. To solve this problem, it is necessary to strengthen the classification and matching of indigenous iron and establish necessary testing work.

The meeting fully exchanged experiences on how to maintain the service life of the furnace lining in current converter steelmaking using indigenous iron. The best furnace lining service life has always been at the Gu County Iron Plant in Shanxi, which currently averages more than sixty heats and uses dolomite furnace linings without adding magnesite, making it a national red flag in furnace linings. Because the supply of dolomite is insufficient, this factory has recently created methods such as indigenous furnaces for burning dolomite and simple mechanical brick laying. This can be widely promoted nationwide, especially in newly built small converter plants. (Attached picture)

    务虚务实同时并举　思想技术一起解决
    冶金部现场会议促进土铁炼钢
    据新华社天津11日电　冶金工业部7日到9日在天津召开全国地方炼钢现场促进会，介绍了天津新兴钢厂土铁炼钢的基本措施和操作经验，研究解决了转炉炼钢的若干技术关键和操作方法问题。
    自从党中央政治局扩大会议以后，全国各省、市党委书记挂帅，以钢为纲，发动群众，形成了全党全民办钢铁工业的空前高潮。9月份以来，全国生铁的产量扶摇直上，生铁不足的情况得到扭转。钢的产量在最近一月来虽然也有了增长，但是比起铁来还相差很多，原因之一就是利用土铁炼钢的技术问题没有解决。10月份是关键性的一个月，必须组织钢的生产大跃进，并且迅速解决土铁炼钢的技术问题。冶金工业部在9月份组织土铁炼钢工业组在天津新兴钢厂进行了系统的生产试验，现已基本试验成功。
    会议分析了跃进计划的执行情况和今后的任务。代表们一致同意，为了保证钢产翻一番的目标提前实现，必须一手抓铁，一手抓钢。
    会议采取虚实并举的方法，着重讨论和解决了土铁炼钢的思想问题和方法问题。在会议以前，有不少熟悉技术的干部对土铁能否炼成钢抱有怀疑、观望甚至抵触的情绪。有些人认为土铁中含矽、锰、炭过低，含硫过高，在平炉中无法脱硫，在转炉吹炼中热量不足，同时含硫过高炼不出合用的钢来；还有些人认为转炉用土铁炼钢外国没有，书本上没有，当然现在也不行。会议指出，解决这个问题的关键在于政治挂帅、群众路线和创造性的生产技术活动。这里必须过一个技术关，但首先要过思想关，才有可能找出克服土铁炼钢技术上困难的途径。冶金工业部土铁炼钢组在新兴钢厂的工作经验，打破了土铁不能炼成钢的迷信，解放了人们的思想。代表们亲自看到了这个厂的第一转炉炼钢车间使用土铁炼出了沸腾钢，并且轧成了合用的钢材；同时在吹炼中一般不用矽铁和铝来提温，因为炼制的钢种是沸腾钢，不必用矽铁来脱氧，也不用苏打而改用干燥的石灰来脱硫。这种改革简易可行，可以在全国广泛推广。这一事实对土铁炼钢的怀疑派是一个有力的说服。会议鼓励各地展开土铁炼钢的竞赛。
    会议对土铁怎样炼成钢提出了具体的技术组织措施。首先是吹炼温度问题。土铁含矽含锰比一般转炉要求的生铁约低0.6％左右，含炭低1％左右，因此转炉利用土铁炼钢比用正常洋铁炼钢的温度约低摄氏一百八十度左右。这一个巨大的温度差额，必须采取提高铁水温度和保持温度来补偿，否则在吹炼中会冻结或者炼不出好钢，注不成好锭。目前各厂提温有两种方法，一个是现在各地普遍采用的，在吹炼中向转炉内大量加入矽铁和铝。这个方法极不合理，因为矽铁和铝是用大量的电炼出来的，价格很贵，目前来源不多，大量使用是一个极大的浪费，特别是向转炉投矽铁，对炉衬有严重的浸蚀作用，影响炉衬寿命下降。另一个办法是土铁炼钢组在新兴钢厂创造的办法，基本的措施是化铁炉增加热风炉，以提高化铁炉的铁水温度，一般用简单的管式热风炉，将热风温度提高到摄氏三百度左右，效果很大；此外，在化铁炉操作上也可以采取适当地提高焦比，降低焦炭的灰分，化铁炉前膛加热等措施，来提高铁水的温度。在转炉操作中采用面吹、留渣操作，对提高吹炼温度，也有显著的效果。改进生产组织，尽量减少操作过程中的耽误，以免热量散失，也是争取和保持温度的重要措施。
    土铁炼钢的第二个重要技术问题，是与高硫作斗争。硫在钢内是有害杂质。土铁中含硫一般在0.2％到0.7％，甚至高达1％到3％以上，比一般转炉用的生铁高几倍到几十倍。含硫过多，钢会变脆，特别在红热情况下变脆，以致不易加工。要利用这种高硫的土铁炼成好钢，必须采取各种脱硫措施。基本措施是转炉的化铁炉采用碱性化铁炉，便于在化铁过程中采用脱硫能力高的碱性渣脱硫。根据新兴钢厂试验的结果，这样在化铁炉中可以脱硫50％到70％，最高达到80％左右。目前各地的化铁炉除少数以外，都是酸性炉衬，为了便于脱硫，应该将化铁炉改成碱性，改的方法只要将化铁炉熔化带的炉衬改用白云石砖或其他碱性耐火材料就行。但是采用碱性化铁炉脱硫时需要提高焦比，也需要提高温度，所以改碱性化铁炉时应该同时采取热风，这样就可以收到提温脱硫的双重效果。个别地区土铁中含硫特别高，在化铁及吹炼过程中不能使硫降到需要的程度，在这种情况下，如果铁水、钢水温度够高，也可以在铁水桶和钢水桶中加石灰、萤石等来脱硫。在前膛吹石灰和在大厂利用电炉、平炉渣脱硫也有一定效果，可以作为辅助的方法。
      土铁炼钢的第三个重要技术问题，是土铁成分的均匀化问题，土铁来自四面八方，并且土炉子每次出铁很少，成分变化很大，因此利用土铁来炼钢，必须充分估计到生铁成分变化对转炉操作的影响。要解决这个问题，就必须加强土铁的分类搭配使用和建立必要的化验工作。
    会议对当前转炉用土铁炼钢中如何保持炉衬寿命问题，充分交流了经验。炉衬寿命一直最好的是山西故县铁厂，目前平均在六十炉以上，而且采用白云石炉衬，不掺镁砂，是全国炉衬方面的红旗。因为白云石供应不足，这个厂最近还创造了土炉烧白云石，简单机械打砖等方法。这在全国范围内，特别在新建小型转炉厂内，是可以普遍推广的。（附图片）
