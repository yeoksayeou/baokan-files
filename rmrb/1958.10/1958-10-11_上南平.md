    Ascending Nanping
    Li Jishen
  Written to advise Taiwanese soldiers and civilians to respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call for peaceful negotiations as soon as possible.

  Looking towards Jinmen, gazing at Matsu, overlooking Penghu and Taiwan. Like a long serpent and a big boar, they bring disaster. The artillery punishment is initially tested; sand worms, apes, and cranes are all worthy of pity. The Marshal's proclamation brightens people's hearts. A path to survival is arranged. Though veiled in gloom, being invaded, suffering hardships is not right. Break through the heavy shackles, make a decisive decision, love the country as one family, and join hands on the spring terrace. May peaceful negotiations succeed, and return as soon as possible!

  劝告台湾军民同胞及早响应
  彭德怀部长和平谈判号召而作望金门，瞻马祖，瞰澎台。长蛇封豕并为灾。炮惩初试，沙虫猿鹤总堪哀。元戎文告豁人怀。生路安排。漫阴霾。被侵略，活受罪，不应该。破重重枷锁，当机立断，爱国一家，携手上春臺。愿和平谈判成，及早归来！
