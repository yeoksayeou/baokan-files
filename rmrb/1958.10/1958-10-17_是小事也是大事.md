Small Matters Are Also Big Matters
Zeng Zhi

In the early days of the establishment of the Wanchun People's Commune, the canteens were not run well, and the members had many complaints. The reason was that some commune cadres believed that living problems were "small matters" and not worth spending a lot of effort to solve after the collectivization of life.

Are living problems small matters or big matters? Generally speaking, living problems are small matters. But not all living problems are small matters. That is to say, in some cases, living problems can become big matters. In the People's Commune, living problems are even more important, as the cadres of Wanchun Commune later realized: it is a serious political task.

Is it an exaggeration to say that it is a serious political task? No. Lenin once said: If women are not liberated from tedious housework, despite the promulgation of various laws for the liberation of women, women are still household slaves, because trivial household affairs oppress them, suffocate them, and make them dull and humble. Now the People's Commune is running canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, etc., precisely to complete the great cause of thoroughly liberating women. Isn't this a matter of great political significance?

Every People's Commune has thousands or even tens of thousands of people. How well or badly the collective life of so many people is managed has a great impact on production. If the commune's public canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, etc., are well run, a large amount of female labor can be freed from tedious housework and put into production; if the collective canteen is well run, the male and female members will be healthy and in a good mood, and will love the commune and work harder. Conversely, if public canteens, nurseries, etc., are not well run, the members will have worries, especially women, who will be "physically in the fields but mentally at home." Especially at a time when the mass steelmaking campaign and autumn harvesting and planting are very tense and labor is in short supply, it is even more important to manage the collective life of the commune well.

Managing collective life well can not only promote the development of production, but also promote the superiority of communism to the peasant masses, and further cultivate and exercise the collectivist thinking of the peasant masses. For the superiority of collective production, the peasant masses have long been deeply convinced from the experience of cooperation over the past few years. However, for living problems, the views are not so simple. Although the peasant masses have long yearned for communism, for many years they have been accustomed to small family life, have not lived together with many people, and are somewhat skeptical whether the current collective life is necessarily superior to their own family life. The peasant masses mostly judge whether a society is good or bad based on the changes in their own lives. Therefore, if the collective life of the commune is well run, it will further strengthen the peasant masses' confidence in socialism and communism. Conversely, if collective life cannot be superior to family life, it may cause some peasants to doubt the beautiful prospects of communism, thereby affecting their enthusiasm for building socialism and communism, and affecting the consolidation and development of the People's Commune.

Since the commune organizes the production and life of all members together, the members rely on the commune and the collective for everything from clothing, eating, taking care of children, and supporting the elderly, instead of relying on the family. The improvement of individual life depends on the development of the collective cause, which prompts the members to shift from caring about individuals and families to caring about the commune and the collective. In this way, members will also gradually overcome the individualism and departmentalism generated by the individual economy in common labor and common life, and gradually cultivate the collectivist and communist thinking of "one for all, all for one."

It is not an easy task to manage collective life well, but it is entirely possible to manage it well. The key to whether it can be managed well lies in whether the mass line can be followed. By following the mass line, discussing matters with the masses, and "everyone handling the affairs of everyone" and "everyone proposing questions and everyone answering them," it can be managed well. The practice of Wanchun Commune is the best example.

    是小事也是大事
    曾志
    万春人民公社建立初期，食堂办的不好，社员意见很多。原因是有些社干部认为生活问题是“小事”，不值得花很大力量去解决生活集体化以后的问题。
    生活问题究竟是小事还是大事？一般说，生活问题是小事。但也不是所有生活问题都是小事。这就是说，在某些情况下，生活问题会成为大事。在人民公社里生活问题更是大事，就如万春公社的干部后来所认识到的：是一个严重的政治任务。
    说它是严重的政治任务，有没有夸大之处呢？没有。列宁曾经说过：如果不把妇女从烦琐的家务劳动中解放出来，尽管颁布了种种解放妇女的法律，但妇女仍然是家庭奴隶，因为琐碎的家庭事务压迫她们，窒息她们，会使她们变得愚钝卑贱。现在人民公社办食堂、托儿所、缝纫组等，正是要完成彻底解放妇女的伟业，这不是有很大政治意义的事吗？
    每一个人民公社都有成千以至好几万人，这样多人的集体生活搞的好不好，对生产的影响很大。如果公社的公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组等搞得好，就可以使大量的妇女劳动力，从烦琐的家务劳动中解脱出来投入生产；如果集体食堂办得好，就会使男女社员身体健康、心情舒畅，更加热爱公社，更加努力劳动。相反，如果公共食堂、托儿所等搞得不好，社员们就会有后顾之忧，尤其是妇女，就会“身在田间心在家”。特别是当前大炼钢铁和秋收秋种非常紧张、劳动力很感缺乏的时候，搞好公社的集体生活就更加重要。
    搞好集体生活，不仅可以促进生产的发展，而且还可以向农民群众宣扬共产主义的优越性，进一步培养和锻炼农民群众的集体主义思想。对于集体生产的优越性，几年来，农民群众从合作化的经历中，早已深信不疑。但是，对于生活问题，看法就不那么简单了。虽然农民群众早已向往着共产主义，但是，多少年来都是习惯于一家一户的小家庭生活，没有和许多人一起共同生活过，现在的集体生活是不是一定比自己的家庭生活优越呢？多少有点半信半疑。而农民群众看一个社会好不好，又多半是根据自己生活的变化。因此，公社的集体生活搞得好，就会更加坚定农民群众对社会主义、共产主义的信心。相反，如果集体生活不能比家庭生活优越，那就可能引起一些农民对共产主义美好前景的怀疑，从而影响了他们建设社会主义、共产主义的积极性，影响人民公社的巩固和发展。
    由于公社把全体社员的生产和生活组织在一起，社员穿衣、吃饭、带孩子、养老人……样样事情都要依靠公社、依靠集体，而不依靠家庭，个人生活的提高要依赖于集体事业的发展，这就促使社员们从关心个人、家庭转而关心公社、关心集体。这样，也就会使社员在共同劳动和共同生活中，逐渐克服由个体经济所产生的个人主义、本位主义思想，逐渐培养起“我为人人，人人为我”的集体主义、共产主义思想。
    要搞好集体生活不是一件很容易的事情，但是也完全有可能搞好。搞得好搞不好的关键，就在于能不能走群众路线。走群众路线，有事和群众商量，“众人的事众人办”“众人出题众人作”，就可以搞好。万春公社的做法，就是最好的例证。
