	Auspicious and Celebratory
	The report of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture's universal Mandarin Chinese learning campaign is truly heartening. This demonstrates that the Korean people have taken a significant leap forward in the new socialist ethnic relations.
	Language is a tool for expressing thoughts. Without a common language, it's difficult to understand each other and learn from each other's strengths. The vast majority of Han people and ethnic minorities recognize this and have long been learning each other's languages to promote harmonious relations and common progress among all ethnic groups. This benefits our socialist construction. However, some nationalists use this as a weapon to launch frantic attacks against the Party and the people. They say that ethnic minorities learning Mandarin Chinese "harms national dignity" and "betrays their own ethnicity," and so on. Now, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has shattered these slanders and launched a campaign to learn Mandarin Chinese throughout the prefecture. Some Korean cadres consider mastering Mandarin Chinese as a basic measure for being both red and expert. This is a welcome development! Contrary to what the nationalists have predicted, our socialist family of all ethnic groups, after learning Mandarin Chinese, will show even greater mutual respect and further promote the strengths of each ethnicity. Our big family will become more united, happier, and more prosperous!

    可喜可庆
    延边朝鲜族自治州全民学汉语的报道，令人欢欣鼓舞。这说明朝鲜族人民在社会主义的新的民族关系上，大大跃进了一步。
    语言是表达思想的工具，没有彼此相通的语言，很难做到互相了解，取长补短。绝大多数汉族和少数民族人民都体会到这点，早就互相学习语言，促进各族之间的关系更融洽，共同进步。这是对我国社会主义建设有利的。但是，一些民族主义分子却以此当武器，向党和人民展开了疯狂的进攻。他们说少数民族学汉语是“伤害了民族尊严”、“背叛了本民族”，等等。现在，延边朝鲜族自治州粉碎了这些谰言，在全州范围内掀起了学习汉族语言的运动。有些朝鲜族干部把掌握汉语作为红专的一项基本措施。这是一件可喜的事！我们各族的社会主义的大家庭同民族主义分子所料相反，学习汉语以后，各族之间更加互相尊重，更加发扬了各民族的优点。我们的大家庭一定会更团结，更幸福，更富强！
