    Let People Eat More and Better - Sichuan Sweet Oranges
    The sweet oranges (Citrus reticulata Blanco) produced in Sichuan are very famous in domestic and foreign markets, and the most famous of these is the "Jiangjin Goose Egg Orange." This kind of sweet orange has a large size and thin skin, contains a lot of juice, and has a moderately sweet and sour taste, and is rich in nutrition. In order to let people eat more of this excellent sweet orange, in recent years the Sichuan agricultural department has paid special attention to the grafting, propagation and promotion of this improved variety of sapling. In recent years, more than 270,000 goose egg orange saplings have been shipped from Jiangjin alone. In the near future, Jiangjin goose egg oranges will no longer be produced only in Jiangjin, but will be produced in many places, and can be eaten everywhere.
    Although sweet oranges are delicious, the time that people can eat fresh sweet oranges in a year is very short. Sichuan fruit farmers are working hard to solve this problem and have already found some ways. Farmers in Jiangjin and other places have selected some early-maturing and late-maturing varieties from a large number of sweet orange varieties for planned cultivation and propagation. These early-maturing varieties, such as "Tongzi Gan", "Thin-skinned Fine-leaf Gan", and "Bing Tang Gan", generally mature in early October, about two months earlier than ordinary citrus. Among them, "Bing Tang Gan" can be eaten when the fruit peel is still green, and the flesh is crisp, tender and fragrant. In addition, late-maturing sweet oranges generally mature two months later than mid-maturing varieties. In the future, people will have more opportunities to eat Sichuan sweet oranges within a year.
    In addition, fruit farmers are also trying to make sweet orange trees bear fruit multiple times in a year. This interesting experiment has recently been successful in many places. A sweet orange tree in Xinguang No. 14 Agricultural Cooperative in Zhenyu Township, Yuechi County, bore fruit three times in one year from last year to this year. Wang Liyin, a farmer in Tieqiao Township, Kaixian County, also successfully experimented with two crops a year on three sweet orange trees. Recently, sweet orange trees that bear fruit twice a year have appeared one after another in Dechang County, a subtropical region of Sichuan. This is the result of the creative experiment of farmers who dare to think and dare to do. They adopted new pruning and fertilization methods, paid attention to pest control and disease prevention, and especially tried to protect fruit trees through the winter, so that some autumn flowers could bear fruit.

    让人们吃到更多更好的——四川甜橙
    四川出产的甜橙（广柑），在国内外市场上是很驰名的，而其中最著名的又算“江津鹅蛋橙”。这种甜橙个大皮薄，含汁特多，而且味道甜酸适度，营养丰富。为了让人们吃到更多这种优良甜橙，最近几年以来四川农业部门特别注意了这种良种树苗的嫁接繁殖和推广。在最近几年之内，由江津一地运出的鹅蛋橙树苗有二十七万多株。不久将来，江津鹅蛋橙不再只出产在江津，而是许多地方都出产，随处都能吃到了。
    甜橙虽然好吃，但一年之中人们能吃到新鲜甜橙的时间很短，四川果农正在为解决这个难题而努力，而且已经找到一些门径。江津等地农民从大量甜橙品种中，选出一部分早熟品种和迟熟品种来有计划进行栽培繁殖。这些早熟的品种如“桐子柑”“薄皮细叶柑”“冰糖柑”等，一般在10月上旬即成熟，比一般柑早熟两个月左右。其中如“冰糖柑”，在果实皮色尚青时，果肉即脆嫩清香可吃。另外的迟熟甜橙，一般比中熟品种成熟期晚两个月。将来人们在一年之内就有更多的机会可以吃到四川的甜橙了。
    另外，果农们还想方设法让甜橙树在一年之内多次结果。这个有趣的试验，最近在许多地方已获得成功。岳池县镇裕乡新光十四农业社的一株甜橙树，去年到今年的一年时间内结了三次果，开县铁桥乡农民王立银，也在三株甜橙树上试验一年结两次果成功。最近，这种一年结两次果实的甜橙树，在四川亚热带地区的德昌县各地陆续出现。这是农民们敢想敢做的创造性试验的结果。他们采用新的剪枝和施肥方法，注意除虫防病，特别设法保护果树过冬，让一部分秋花结出果实。　（孙跃冬）
