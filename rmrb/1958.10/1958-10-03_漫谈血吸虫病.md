    A Casual Discussion of Schistosomiasis
    Zhang Cangjiang
    In the vast rural areas along the Yangtze River and in South China, there is a prevalent disease known as "big belly disease." Millions of farmers and fishermen are infected, and hundreds of millions of people are threatened by it. This is "schistosomiasis."

    For hundreds of years, this disease has tormented the working people. In the areas where it was most prevalent in the past, it was so severe that almost every household was affected, fields were barren, and it severely impacted rural production. The reactionary rule of the old society turned a blind eye to local diseases in the countryside, showing no concern or sympathy, and never took any positive measures. After liberation, under the leadership and care of the Party, vigorous prevention and research work was launched. The Party Central Committee sent a nine-member team to specifically lead medical and health cadres and the broad masses in epidemic areas to fight against schistosomiasis. In 1956, it was even proposed that schistosomiasis be eliminated within seven years.

    In this year's Great Leap Forward, the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis has also made leaps and bounds under the call to break superstitions and promote technological revolution. Many townships and counties that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis have emerged one after another. The seven-year target is no longer applicable. Currently, the local plans are to basically eliminate this disease, which seriously endangers the health of the working people, within two or three years nationwide.

    Schistosomiasis has a long history. It is said that the disease existed as early as more than a thousand years before Christ. There are also early records of similar diseases in Chinese classics. The Classic of Mountains and Seas, the Rites of Zhou, and others mention "Gu," and the Treatise on the Pathogenesis of Diseases by Chao Yuanfang of the Sui Dynasty gave a detailed account. Later works such as "Bloating," "Zheng," "Jia," "Xuan," and "Water Poison" gradually provided more detailed analyses and demonstrations on the causes, symptoms, and treatments of the disease.

    The schistosome is a parasite that lives in the mesenteric blood vessels of humans. It sucks human blood, releases toxins into the blood vessels, and harms human health.

    Adult worms are dioecious, about half an inch long, and gray in color. They mate and lay eggs in human blood vessels. The eggs enter the intestinal cavity through small ulcers in the intestinal wall and are excreted with the feces. When the eggs encounter water and suitable temperature, they hatch into larvae called "miracidia." Miracidia have a very short lifespan and must enter the body of the Oncomelania hupensis snail within one or two days to survive. After entering the snail's body, they concentrate in the liver's lymphatic system, become sporocysts, and gradually transform into cercariae. After about fifty days, the mature cercariae leave the Oncomelania hupensis snail and enter the water, floating on the surface of rivers and lakes. Within two or three days, if they encounter humans or domestic animals, they invade their skin and circulate with the blood. Initially, they concentrate in the right heart, then pass through the portal vein system to reach their settled mesenteric veins, and after twenty or thirty days, they develop into adult worms.

    After schistosomes invade the human body, they cause schistosomiasis. Its symptoms and signs can usually be divided into three stages in clinical terms:

    1.  Incubation period: the period from when the cercariae invade the human body to when they develop into adult worms, about a month. Cercariae may not cause symptoms when they enter the skin, but as they migrate and begin to grow in the body until they mature, there are often symptoms such as fever, urticaria, local edema, limb pain, cough, vomiting, and constipation.

    2.  Early stage: the period when adult worms begin to lay eggs in large quantities, about three to ten weeks. The main symptoms are fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and diarrhea.

    3.  Late stage: fibrous changes occur at the sites where the eggs remain, occurring about four or five years after infection. Its main manifestations are hepatosplenomegaly, cirrhosis, ascites, anemia, fever, and emaciation.

    In the early stages, treatment is mainly based on trivalent antimonials (potassium antimony tartrate); in the late stages, comprehensive treatment is adopted. Traditional Chinese medicine also makes many contributions to the differentiation and treatment of both early and late stages. In the past few years, due to conservative thinking, superstition about treatment courses, superstition that antimonial agents were too toxic, superstition about technology, superstition about orthodoxy, and superstition about material conditions, only over 200,000 people were treated in 1956, and even with extra effort in 1957, only 500,000 people were treated. In the Great Leap Forward, comrades in schistosomiasis prevention broke superstitions, sought solutions from all directions, and have made several improvements so far, increasing work efficiency by a hundredfold, increasing the cure rate from 60%-70% in the past to 90%, and reducing the mortality rate from 4 per thousand in the past to 0.1 per thousand.

    In the process of breaking superstitions, young people have exerted their revolutionary drive, but have also experienced many arduous struggles. The previous long-term treatment (one month, twenty days) has been broken down, shortened to three-day treatment, two-day treatment, one-day treatment, and four-hour treatment. Research is still continuing, hoping to achieve the goal of a single injection treatment. This approach, starting from the patient and the needs and demands of the broad masses of farmers, closely integrates with production, which is the new situation after "politics in command."

    The epidemic of schistosomiasis must simultaneously possess three conditions: first, there must be people or domestic animals with schistosomiasis in the local area; second, there must be Oncomelania hupensis snails in the local area; and third, human and animal skin must come into contact with water containing cercariae. Without any of these three conditions, schistosomiasis cannot survive. Our task is to cut off these links and eliminate these conditions in order to basically, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate schistosomiasis.

    In terms of treatment, much research and improvement have been done from various angles, such as drugs, therapies, treatment courses, combining treatment with production, and nursing. In terms of killing schistosome eggs, many different methods such as chemical fertilizers, ammonia compounds, lime, compost fermentation, and manure tank storage have been used, and great results have been achieved. In terms of snail eradication, a mass movement has been formed, with soil burial, chemicals, wild plants, burning, composting grass, land reclamation, dike construction, and other methods tailored to different regions to completely eliminate Oncomelania hupensis snails.

    漫谈血吸虫病
    张沧江
    在我国长江沿岸及华南的广大农村里，流行着一种“大肚子病”。上千万的农民和渔民遭受感染，上亿万的人口受其威胁，这就是“血吸虫病”。
    几百年来，这种病长期折磨着劳动人民，以前在流行得比较厉害的地区里，简直是十室九空，田园荒芜，非常严重地影响着农村生产。旧社会的反动统治，对农村的地方病熟视无睹，不关痛痒，未曾采取什么积极措施。解放后，在党的领导和关怀下，大力展开防治研究工作，党中央派出九人小组，专门领导流行地区的医药卫生干部和广大群众，与血吸虫病进行斗争，1956年更提出了七年内消灭血吸虫病的指标。
    在今年的全民大跃进中，血吸虫病的防治工作，在破除迷信技术革命的号召下，也飞跃前进。各地先后出现了许多基本上消灭了血吸虫病的乡和县，七年的指标，已不适用，目前各地的规划是两三年中在全国范围内，基本消灭这种严重危害劳动人民健康的疾病。
    血吸虫病的历史悠久，据说在公元前一千多年，便有此病存在。我国的典籍中，很早也有类似这种病的记载，山海经、周礼等都谈到“蛊”，到隋代的巢氏病源，则有了详细的记述。后来的“臌胀”、“症”、“瘕”、“痃”、“水毒”等，逐渐对病因、症状、治疗等方面，有着更详尽的分析和论证。
    血吸虫是一种寄生在人的肠系膜血管内的寄生虫。吸取人的血液在血管里放毒素、危害人体健康。
    成虫有雌雄两性，大约有半寸长，灰色。在人体血管内交配产卵，虫卵通过肠壁小溃疡进入肠腔，随着粪便排出。虫卵遇着水及适宜的温度时，便孵化为幼虫，叫做“毛蚴”。毛蚴寿命很短，必须在一两天内钻入钉螺蛳的体内才能生存。在进入钉螺蛳身体后，集中在其肝的淋巴系统，变成胞蚴，逐渐再变为尾蚴，大约经过五十天的时间，成熟的尾蚴，脱离了钉螺蛳进入水中，停浮在河湖的水面上。三两天以内，如遇到人或家畜，侵入其皮肤，随着血液流行。起初集中于右心脏，然后通过肝门脉系统到达其定居的肠系膜静脉，二三十天之后，便发育成为成虫。
    血吸虫侵入人体后，便造成了血吸虫病，其症状与体征，通常在临床上可以分为三个时期来描述：
    1、潜伏期：即自尾蚴侵入人体到发育为成虫的时期，约一个月左右。尾蚴钻入皮肤，可能不引起症状，但是在体内移行，开始成长，至成熟前，则常有发热、荨麻疹、局部浮肿、四肢酸疼、咳嗽、呕吐、便秘等症状。
    2、早期：即成虫开始大量产卵的时期，约三至十星期。主要症状是发热、肝脾肿大和下痢。
    3、晚期：即虫卵留滞处有纤维性变化，约在感染后四五年内发生。其主要表现为肝脾肿大、肝硬化、腹腔积水、贫血、发烧及消瘦。
    早期治疗在目前以三价锑剂（酒石酸锑钾）为主；晚期采用综合治疗，中医方面则在早期晚期辨证论治，都有很多的贡献。过去的几年中，因为思想保守，迷信疗程，迷信锑剂毒性太高，迷信技术，迷信正轨，迷信物质条件等，在1956年只治疗了二十几万人，1957年加了一把劲，也只治疗了五十万人。大跃进中，血防同志们破除了迷信，从各方想办法，到目前为止，已作了若干改进，把工作效率提高了一百倍，治愈率自过去的60％—70％提高到90％，病死率自过去的千分之四，降低到千分之零点一。
    在破除迷信的过程中，青年人发挥了革命的干劲，但也曾经历了许多艰苦的斗争。以前的长程疗法（一个月，二十天），已被打破，缩短为三日疗法，二日疗法，一日疗法，四小时疗法。目前还在继续钻研，希望能够达到一针治疗的目标。这样从病人出发，从广大农民的需要和要求出发，密切结合生产，是“政治挂帅”后的新形势。
    血吸虫病的流行，是一定要同时具备着三个条件，第一是要当地有患血吸虫病的人或家畜，第二是要当地有钉螺蛳，第三是要人和动物的皮肤与含有尾蚴的水接触。这三个条件，缺少任何一样，血吸虫就没有办法生存下去。我们的任务，便是切断这些环节，消灭这些条件，以基本、彻底、全部、干净地消灭血吸虫。
    在治疗方面，从药物、疗法、疗程、治疗结合生产、护理等各个角度，都做了不少的研究工作和改进。在杀灭血吸虫卵方面，则利用了化学肥料、氨化合物、石灰、堆粪发酵、粪缸贮粪等许多不同的方法，收到了很大的效果。在灭螺方面，更已形成了一个群众性的运动，土埋、化学品、野生植物、火烧、铲草堆肥、围垦、修堤筑坝，在不同地区采取了不同的因地制宜的方法，来彻底消灭钉螺。
