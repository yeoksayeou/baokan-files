Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 25th: The Ministry of Coal Industry held an on-site meeting in Baofeng County, Henan Province, on running coal mines by the whole people. The meeting proposed to further implement the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass" to change the passive situation of coal shortage in the southern provinces. It also decided to launch a vigorous technical transformation movement in small coal mines across the country this winter and next spring.

The insufficient supply of coal is a prominent problem on the steel front. Especially in the southern provinces, due to the weak foundation of the coal industry and the limited transportation capacity from the north, the coal supply is tight, which threatens the completion of steel production tasks. After September, various regions launched a mass movement to run coal mines by the whole people, mainly focusing on "small, indigenous, and mass" methods, which led to a sharp increase in coal production. Some areas quickly changed the situation of coal shortage. However, the development of the movement is still very uneven. In order to quickly change this situation, the meeting believes that it is necessary to further implement the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy and resolutely and massively develop small coal mines. Especially in the southern provinces, only by developing small coal mines can we ensure the completion of this year's steel production tasks and adapt to the needs of the future large-scale development of the steel industry. Since many areas in the southern provinces have discovered coal resources and have a large demand for coal, the meeting pointed out that the focus of leadership in the coal industry should gradually shift south. Northern mines should also allocate manpower and materials to support the large-scale development of the coal industry in the south.

During the meeting, the representatives studied the experience of Baofeng County in running coal mines by the whole people through on-site visits and research. Based on the experience of Baofeng County and combined with the specific conditions of various provinces, they also focused on studying the transformation of small coal mines. Although the small coal mines that have been developed in large numbers in various regions have shown great power, they also have their shortcomings, mainly in simple equipment, high labor costs, and poor ability to resist natural disasters. Especially as coal is mined deeper and deeper, the difficulties of drainage, ventilation, transportation, and hoisting increase. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly mobilize the masses to transform small coal mines on the basis of universal development. The requirements for the transformation are to enhance the ability to resist natural disasters, improve production efficiency, improve working conditions, and save labor. The method is to focus on self-reliance by the masses, supplemented by necessary technical assistance from the state.

The meeting pointed out that the transformation of small coal mines should be carried out comprehensively and with emphasis on key areas. The key areas are: small kilns that produce coking coal and are close to steel bases, areas with a weak foundation for coal production, and inclined shafts and open-pit mines with greater development prospects. According to the plans of various provinces, thousands of small kilns will be technically transformed this winter and next spring. After the transformation, the total annual production capacity of these small kilns can reach more than 200 million tons.

### 煤炭部要求发展小煤窑、改造小煤窑  让南方煤炭早日自给

    煤炭部要求发展小煤窑、改造小煤窑
    让南方煤炭早日自给
    据新华社郑州25日电　煤炭工业部在河南宝丰县召开全民办煤矿现场会议，提出要进一步贯彻“小、土、群”方针，改变南方各省缺煤的被动局面，并决定今冬明春在全国小煤窑中展开一个轰轰烈烈的技术改造运动。
    煤不够用，是当前钢铁战线上突出的问题。特别是南方各省，由于煤炭工业基础薄弱，北方的煤又因运输力的限制不能大量地运去，因此煤炭供应紧张，威胁着钢铁生产任务的完成。9月份以后，各地展开了“小、土、群”为主的全民办煤矿运动，使煤炭产量急剧上升，有的地区很快就改变了缺煤的局面。但是，运动发展得还是很不平衡。为了迅速改变这种局面，会议认为必须进一步贯彻“小、土、群”方针，坚决地大量地发展小煤窑。特别是南方各省，只有发展小煤窑才能保证今年钢铁生产任务的完成，适应今后钢铁工业大发展的需要。由于目前南方各省已有许多地区发现煤炭资源，而又大量需要煤炭，因此会议指出今后煤炭工业的领导重心应该逐渐南移，北方各矿也应该抽调人力物力支援南方大办煤炭工业。
    会议期间，代表们通过现场参观与访问，研究了宝丰县全民办煤矿的经验；根据宝丰县经验，结合各省的具体情况，又着重研究了小煤窑的改造问题。目前各地大量发展的小煤窑，虽然已经显示出巨大的威力，但是也有它的缺点，主要是设备简单，花费劳动力多，抵抗自然灾害的能力差等等。特别是煤越挖越深后，排水、通风、运输、提升等的困难越多。因此必须在普遍发展的基础上，迅速发动群众改造小煤窑。改造的要求是：增强抵抗自然灾害的能力，提高生产效率，改善劳动条件和节省人力，办法是以群众自办为主，国家予以必要的技术援助为辅。
    会议指出，小煤窑的改造工作一方面要全面进行，同时要重点提高。重点是：生产炼焦煤而又靠近钢铁基地的小窑，煤炭生产基础薄弱的地区，发展前途较大的平硐和露天矿等。根据各省规划，今冬明春将有上千个小窑重点进行技术改造。经过改造，这些小窑总的年产能力就可以达到二亿吨以上。
