    Supporting the Reduction of Manuscript Fees

    I am a worker-amateur writer. I support the suggestion of the three writers Zhang Tianyi, Zhou Libo, and Ai Wu regarding the reduction of manuscript fees.

    Some amateur writers earn more from their monthly manuscript fees than their wages. Because of this, some amateur writers are not content with their own work and want to become professional writers; some people create "major works" to earn more manuscript fees, turning small life stories into novels of thousands of words. Excessive manuscript fees are not beneficial to amateur writers at all; on the contrary, they corrupt some amateur writers, alienating them from the masses. It is evident that excessive manuscript fees are harmful and not beneficial to amateur writers.

    Only a minority of people write for manuscript fees alone, because "money" is playing tricks in their minds, so what they write is difficult to get published. The writing motivation of most people is correct, so reducing manuscript fees does not affect the prosperity of creation. Reducing manuscript fees is a powerful test for every amateur writer who is dedicated to literary and artistic endeavors and loves literary creation, and it will be supported by the vast number of amateur writers.

    拥护减低稿费报酬
    我是一个工人业余作者。我拥护张天翼、周立波和艾芜三位作家的关于减低稿费报酬的建议。
    有的业余作者，每月得的稿费比工资还多，由于这样，有的业余作者不安心本身工作，想当专业作家；有的人为多拿稿费，搞“大作品”；把生活小故事的体裁，要写成数千字的小说。稿费过高，对业余作者没有一点好处，相反的，使得有的业余作者，变的腐化了，脱离了群众。由此可见稿费过高，对业余作者是有害无益的。
    只为稿费而写作的人是少数的，个别的，因为有“钱”在他们脑子里作怪，所以他们写的东西是很难得到发表的。大多数人的写作动机是正确的，所以减低稿费报酬并不影响创作的繁荣。减低稿费报酬，是对每一个有志于文艺事业和热爱文艺创作的业余作者有力考验，会得到广大业余作者拥护的。
