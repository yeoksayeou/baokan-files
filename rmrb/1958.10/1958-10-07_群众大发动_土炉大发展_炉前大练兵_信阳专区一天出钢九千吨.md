Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th: The 900,000-strong steel army in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, launched a "satellite" of 9,350.96 tons of steel in a single day on the 5th, setting a new record for the province's daily steel production. After testing, the quality of the steel met the requirements. This is a new miracle that has emerged from the large-scale mass movement in the steelmaking industry.

On the 5th in Xinyang Prefecture, whether it was an advanced or backward area in steel production, whether it was a mountainous or a plain area, steel sparks were flying everywhere and "satellites" were taking off. Xinyang and Shangcheng counties, which broke through the daily production of 1,000 tons of steel on September 30, took the lead on the 5th. Xinyang County produced 5,930.15 tons of steel on the 5th, and Shangcheng County reached 3,330.32 tons. Xincai County, which was extremely short of raw materials and fuel, also jumped on the steelmaking horse on the 5th, producing 45.3 tons of steel in a single day.

In order to organize the entire population to launch a fierce battle for steel in October, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions to the county committees to vigorously develop indigenous steelmaking methods as early as before the National Day. Around the National Day, the entire prefecture organized an 800,000-strong propaganda army, using reports, clapper talks, storytelling and other forms to widely and deeply publicize the great significance of large-scale steelmaking among the masses. Various localities also cleared away various ideological obstacles to large-scale steelmaking through extensive airing of views, big debates, and wall posters. From the Prefectural Committee to the county and township Party committees, the First Secretaries personally took charge in this battle. When Shangcheng County launched the steel battle on the 5th, in addition to the Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee personally taking command, all twelve members of the County Party Committee, one hundred and eighty-one members of the Township Party Committees, and one thousand six hundred and fifty township and commune cadres went deep into the front line to contract and be responsible for different areas. At the same time, the county also established thirty-three secretary experimental furnaces and eighty-nine cadre furnaces.

The indigenous steelmaking methods played a huge role in the high-yield "satellite" launch in Xinyang Prefecture this time. On the 5th, there were 10,557 various indigenous furnaces put into steelmaking in the entire region, mainly underground indigenous furnaces (i.e., stir-frying furnaces), crucibles, and small indigenous furnaces (i.e., quenching furnaces). The common characteristics of these furnaces are that they are quick to build, have simple equipment, are easy to operate, have low costs, and have high yields, so they can universally mobilize the masses to make steel. Shangcheng County rushed to build 390 furnaces overnight on the 4th and put them into production that evening.

In order to break through the technical barriers of indigenous steelmaking methods, Xinyang Prefecture has also created many successful experiences. The more common method adopted in the entire region is to establish steelmaking furnace groups. They ranked the existing technical forces, and a township used three or four old workers to build a core furnace, and then built several steelmaking furnaces around it to form a steelmaking furnace group. The advantage of this method is that it teaches technology while producing, and it is quick to teach and quick to learn. Zhao Renqun, a 71-year-old steelmaking technician from the Dongfeng Commune in Shangcheng County, was responsible for guarding 34 steelmaking furnaces by himself. Xinyang County adopted the method of training soldiers in front of the furnace, and trained 5,400 steelmaking technicians on the 5th. In order to overcome the shortage of smelting tools, the masses also came up with many indigenous methods. They used wooden sticks instead of crowbars, axes instead of iron hammers, and stones instead of drills.

After launching the satellite on the 5th, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference of the First Secretaries of various counties that same night to deploy preparations for organizing even larger "steel satellites" to go to the sky.

    群众大发动  土炉大发展  炉前大练兵
    信阳专区一天出钢九千吨
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省信阳专区九十万钢铁大军5日放出日产钢九千三百五十点九六吨的大卫星，创造了全省日产钢的最高纪录。经过化验，钢的质量合乎要求。这是在炼钢工业方面大搞群众运动出现的新的奇迹。
    5日这天在信阳专区，不论是钢铁生产的先进地区或落后地区，不论是山区或是平原，到处都是钢花四溅，“卫星”腾空而起。9月30日突破日产千吨钢的信阳、商城两县，5日一马当先继续领先。信阳县5日日产钢五千九百三十点一五吨，商城县日产钢达到三千三百三十点三二吨。极端缺乏原料和燃料的新蔡县，5日也跨上了炼钢骏马，日产钢达到四十五点三吨。
    中共信阳地委为了组织全体群众在10月份展开争夺钢的激战，早在国庆节前就向各个县委发布了大搞土法炼钢的指示。全专区在国庆节前后曾组织了八十万宣传大军，利用报告、快板、说唱等形式，在群众中广泛深入地宣传了大搞炼钢的重大意义。各地并通过大鸣大放大辩论，扫清了大办炼钢工业的各种思想障碍。从地委到各县、乡党委，在这场战斗中都是第一书记亲自挂帅。商城县在5日展开争钢战斗时，除县委副书记亲自坐镇指挥外，全县十二个县委委员、一百八十一个乡党委委员和一千六百五十个乡社干部，都深入火线分片包干负责，同时全县还建立了三十三个书记试验炉、八十九个干部炉。
    信阳专区这次大放炼钢高产“卫星”，土法炼钢起了巨大作用。全区在5日这一天投入炼钢的各种土炉有一万零五百五十七座，其中主要是地下土炉（即炒钢炉）、坩锅、小土炉（即焖钢炉）。这些炉子的共同特点是建炉快、设备简单、操作容易、成本低、产量高，因而能够普遍发动群众动手炼钢。商城县在4日一夜就突击建炉三百九十个，并且当晚就投入了生产。
    为了突破土法炼钢的技术关，信阳专区也创造了许多成功的经验。全区比较普遍采取的办法是，建立炼钢炉群。他们把现有技术力量进行排队，一个乡以三、四个老工人建成一个核心炉，周围再建立几个炼钢炉构成炼钢炉群。这种方法的好处是，边生产边传授技术，传得快，学得快。商城县东风社一个七十一岁的老年炼钢技术员赵仁群，一个人就负责看管三十四座炼钢炉。信阳县采取炉前练兵的办法，在5日这一天就训练了五千四百名炼钢技术员。为了克服冶炼工具不足的困难，群众也想出了很多土办法。他们用木棍代替撬杆，用斧头代替铁锤，用石头代替钻子。
    中共信阳地委在5日发射卫星之后，当日深夜就召开各县第一书记电话会议，部署了组织更大“钢卫星”上天的准备工作。
