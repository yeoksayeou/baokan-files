Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion this morning on various aspects of the disarmament issue. The speech by the British representative, Noble, showed that Britain's position on these issues was no different from that of the United States. In his speech, the British representative attempted to dilute the clear intention revealed by the American proposal and the American representative's speech: that Western countries do not actually want to stop nuclear weapons testing for a long time, let alone permanently.

Noble also rehashed the preconditions for a temporary cessation of testing put forward by the United States. He further stated that the United Nations General Assembly should not discuss the substantive issues of stopping testing, but should only express hope that the upcoming Geneva conference would be successful.

The British representative also attempted to shift the responsibility for the deadlock in disarmament negotiations, caused by the attitude of the West, onto the Soviet Union.

Noble attempted to deny the fact, emphasized by the Soviet representative, that so far only the Soviet Union has publicly announced its agreement with the conclusions made by the expert meeting on the issue of monitoring the cessation of nuclear tests. He read out an empty statement issued by the British government welcoming the meeting.

Soviet representative Zorin spoke, giving a brief reply. He emphasized that the question was not whether the British government welcomed the expert meeting, but whether it agreed to the monitoring system proposed by the meeting. The British government had not stated its agreement on this point.

In answering Noble's arguments against the Soviet proposal, Zorin said that the Soviet proposal called for an unconditional cessation of testing, while the Western countries' proposal for a cessation of testing was only temporary and attached with various conditions.

The Soviet representative said that the Western countries entangled the cessation of nuclear weapons testing with the solution of other disarmament issues, and put forward ultimatum-like conditions for solving this most important issue. The Western countries adopted the same position on this issue that they had taken in the London negotiations, only worse than that time.

The Soviet representative explained that the British representative's attempt to place the responsibility for the fact that the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing has not yet been resolved on the Soviet Union is difficult to succeed. Zorin emphasized that this responsibility should be borne by the Western countries, first and foremost by the United States and Britain.

At the meeting on the 15th, the Hungarian People's Republic Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sik, pointed out that the US government was fundamentally unwilling to reach an agreement on the unconditional cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and fundamentally unwilling to make progress on overall disarmament. The actions of the US government, as well as the statements of US government officials and the US press, all prove this.

Sik expressed full support for the Soviet proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing.

Near the end of the meeting, the US and UK representatives spoke. Because the Soviet representative demanded that the US and UK clearly express their attitude on the conclusions of the Geneva nuclear experts meeting at the Political Committee's meeting the day before, the US and UK representatives were forced to formally announce in their speeches that their governments accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the Geneva expert meeting, including the recommendations on monitoring the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

Soviet representative Zorin expressed satisfaction with the above statements of the US and UK representatives, and expressed hope that no more serious difficulties would hinder the smooth progress of the upcoming meeting in Geneva on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

The Political Committee meeting is scheduled to continue on the morning of the 16th.

    联大政委会继续讨论裁军问题
    苏匈代表揭露西方国家开倒车
  　美英被迫宣布接受日内瓦核专家会议的结论
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约14日讯：联合国大会政治委员会今天上午继续讨论裁军问题的各个方面。英国代表诺布耳的发言表明英国在这些问题上的立场同美国的立场没有两样。英国代表在发言中企图冲淡美国提案和美国代表的发言所表露出的这样一个明显的意图：西方国家实际上不想长期停止试验核武器，更不用说什么永久停止试验了。
    诺布耳还重弹美国提出的、暂时停止试验的那些先决条件。他并且表示，联合国大会不应当讨论停止试验的实质问题，而只应当限于表示希望即将举行的日内瓦会议成功。
    英国代表还企图把由于西方的态度而使裁军谈判陷入僵局的责任转嫁于苏联。
    诺布耳企图否认以苏联代表强调指出的这一事实：直到现在只有苏联公开宣布过同意专家会议就监督停止核试验的问题所作出的结论。他宣读了英国政府所发表的一个欢迎这个会议的空洞的声明。
    苏联代表佐林发言，作简短的答复。他强调指出，问题不在于英国政府是否欢迎专家会议，而在于它是否同意这个会议提出的监督制度。英国政府并没有声明同意这点。
    佐林在回答诺布耳针对苏联提案所发表的论调时说，苏联的建议是呼吁无条件地停止试验，而西方国家建议的停止试验只是短期的，并且附带种种条件。
    苏联代表说，西方国家把停止试验核武器同解决裁军的其他问题纠缠在一起，并且在解决这一个最重要的问题上提出最后通牒式的条件。西方国家在这个问题上采取了它们在伦敦谈判时所采取的立场，只是比那一次更坏了一些。
    苏联代表说明，英国代表把停止试验核武器的问题直到现在还没有解决的责任推在苏联身上，这种企图是难以得逞的。佐林强调指出，这个责任应当由西方国家，首先就是由美国和英国来负。
    在15日会议上，匈牙利人民共和国外交部长西克指出美国政府根本不愿意达成无条件停止试验核武器的协定，根本不愿意在整个裁军方面取得进展。美国政府的所作所为以及美国政府负责人士和美国报纸的言论都证明了这一点。
    西克表示完全支持苏联关于裁军和禁止试验核武器问题的建议。
    在会议快结束时，美国和英国代表发了言。由于苏联代表在政治委员会的前一天会议上要求美英两国就日内瓦核专家会议的结论明确表示态度，美英两国代表在这次发言中被迫正式宣布，他们的政府接受日内瓦专家会议的结论和建议，包括有关监督停止核武器试验问题的建议。
    苏联代表佐林对美英两国代表的上述声明表示满意，并且表示希望不再有严重的困难妨碍即将在日内瓦再次召开的关于停止试验核武器问题的会议顺利进行。
    政治委员会会议预定16日上午继续举行。
