Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 24th. Premier Kim Il-sung's speech at tonight's state banquet in honor of the CPV Headquarters is as follows:
　　
　　Dear Commander Yang Yong,
　　Dear Political Commissar Wang Ping,
　　Dear Officers and Soldiers of the heroic Chinese People’s Volunteers,
　　Today, the Korean people are about to bid farewell for the last time to the heroic warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who have established eternally glorious meritorious deeds in our country and are about to return home. On behalf of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic's government, and all the Korean people, I extend infinite gratitude and lofty honor to the last group of returning officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers and to the Chinese people.
　　The heroic warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers, holding high the sacred banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, have been in Korea for eight years since crossing the Yalu River. During the three years of arduous war, you shared weal and woe with the Korean people and the People's Army. In the post-war period, you gave our working people tremendous assistance, accelerating our construction endeavors. During this period, an unparalleled deep emotion has been forged between you and our people.
　　Today, our people, with a feeling of great reluctance to part, bid farewell to the last group of returning warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The Chinese People's Volunteers have left behind in Korea great achievements that our people will never forget.
　　The Korean War was one of the most brutal wars in human history. In this war, the unparalleled heroism and bravery you displayed shocked the whole world. The beastly American imperialists and their lackeys used all kinds of vicious and inhumane methods, recklessly manufacturing inhuman atrocities. However, the more frenzied the enemy's atrocities and the more brutal the war, the more courageous you became. When faced with enormous difficulties, you displayed even greater heroism. In our Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of the sixteen nations headed by American imperialism, the Chinese People's Volunteers made a great contribution to guaranteeing the Korean people's glorious victory and defending lasting peace in the East.
　　The Chinese People's Volunteers demonstrated to the people of the world a model of proletarian internationalism in the Korean War. You have consistently and faithfully carried out the instructions given to you by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, helping the Korean people to repel the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese peoples—American imperialism. You loved Korea as you loved your own motherland, and together with the Korean People's Army, defended Korea's cities and villages with your blood. The hero Huang Jiguang shouted, "Although the enemy's bullets can take my life, they can never take away my dear Korean brothers," and used his chest to block the enemy's firing port. This sentiment of the hero Huang Jiguang is the sentiment of all the warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
　　Far from your hometowns, you treated Korea as your own hometown and loved the Korean people as your own parents and siblings. You helped the socialist construction of our working people. To alleviate the misfortune and suffering of the Korean people and for their happy future, you spared no hardship or sacrifice, exerting all your strength and enthusiasm.
　　You built hundreds of beautiful schools, many bridges and houses with your own hands, and constructed many perfect irrigation facilities. Until the day before you left Korea, you did everything possible for the happiness of the Korean people, to do one more good deed for them. In the increasingly prosperous cities and villages of our motherland, they are permeated with your noble blood, sweat and love. The cities and villages of our motherland will become more and more beautiful, the lives of our people will become happier, and our people will cherish your kindness even more.
　　The Chinese People's Volunteers' noble moral character of loving the people and serving the people has become a model for our people to learn from, and you have always been deeply loved and respected by our people. The various touching stories between you and our people will forever bloom into beautiful flowers in the increasingly prosperous and happy lives of our people.
　　The blood you shed on this land will forever live in the hearts of our people, and the great achievements you have made will forever shine together with our mountains and rivers.
　　For eight years, the common struggle of the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers has unprecedentedly strengthened and developed the friendship and unity forged between the peoples of our two countries in the historical and long-term struggle against the common enemy.
　　The glorious achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War are the pride of the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and also the pride of the socialist camp and peace-loving people all over the world. The great achievements you have established are a model of proletarian internationalism. It will forever be recorded in the annals of progressive humanity. Comrades, the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has made a great contribution to promoting the peaceful reunification of Korea and easing the tense situation in the East. This is a manifestation of the growth of the strength of the peace-loving peoples of Korea and China, and a concrete manifestation of the unprecedented strength of the peace forces in the world. The Chinese People's Volunteers are about to withdraw completely from Korea. However, the American imperialists, disregarding the sincere efforts of the peace-loving peoples of Korea and China, continue to occupy South Korea and are even more blatantly pursuing a policy of aggression that seriously threatens peace.
　　Recently, American imperialism has been stepping up its serious provocative actions to undermine world peace in the Taiwan Strait area. American imperialism, disregarding the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese people, continues to carry out acts of aggression against the Chinese people in Taiwan and the coastal islands of China, seriously threatening world peace.
　　However, any provocative actions by American imperialism can never intimidate the peoples of Korea and China. The era in which imperialists arbitrarily interfered in the internal affairs of other countries and suppressed peace-loving people is gone forever. Aggressors should face up to the new reality of the victorious development of the East. The people of the Eastern countries, headed by the 650 million Chinese people who have been liberated from imperialist oppression, are proudly and confidently advancing victoriously towards a happy future. No attempt by imperialism can stop the advancing road of the Eastern countries that have firmly grasped their own destiny.
　　The Korean people will always firmly stand on the side of the Chinese people in the struggle to defend the achievements of the revolution and oppose imperialist aggression. American imperialism should withdraw from South Korea and Taiwan as soon as possible. If the imperialists disregard the new reality that has already changed and continue to pursue a policy of aggression, they will surely suffer a defeat even more serious than the Korean War and will be completely buried.
　　Now the strength of the peoples of Korea and China is stronger than when the American imperialists launched the Korean War eight years ago, and continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution on the economic and political-ideological fronts, and are making rapid progress in socialist construction. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the 650 million Chinese people in socialist construction is unprecedentedly high, and a great leap forward has been launched in industrial and agricultural production. It is entirely possible to complete the task of catching up with and surpassing Britain in industry ahead of schedule in the next few years. The old China of poverty and backwardness is gone forever, and today's New China is transforming into a socialist power with highly developed industry. The victories achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction have infinitely inspired the progressive humanity of the world who love peace and socialism, and have contributed to strengthening the socialist forces in the East and the world.
　　Our people rejoice at the great victories achieved by the Chinese people as their own victories, and are infinitely inspired. The Korean people are striving for great achievements in socialist construction. Our people have completed the socialist transformation of the country and have launched a great upsurge of socialist construction in our cities and villages. Now the Korean people are united as one around the Workers' Party with steel-like solidarity, and their revolutionary enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. All the working people of our country are striding forward on the road of socialism with unwavering confidence in victory, galloping on the Chollima.
　　The Korean people are fighting heroically towards the broad prospect of building their motherland into a socialist industrial country in a few years, and are unfolding a heroic struggle for its realization. Our workers are fighting to complete the first five-year plan one and a half years ahead of schedule, and are displaying infinite creative spirit in the struggle to further increase the speed of socialist construction and rapidly increase labor productivity. In order to build a prosperous socialist countryside free from natural disasters, our peasants are unanimously mobilized to vigorously carry out irrigation projects and are launching a struggle to significantly increase the yield per unit area. They will bravely overcome all difficulties in this struggle and will surely achieve great victories.
　　We are confident that we can say to you: After you leave our country, the Korean people will surely firmly defend their line of defense at any time, victoriously complete the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the socialist construction of the northern half of the Republic, and will powerfully defend the Eastern outpost of peace and socialism.
　　The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China are being consolidated and developed day by day. The peoples of our two countries are firmly united together by common ideas and common ideals.
　　The Korean people will strive to further strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation with the Chinese people, and will always be consistently faithful to proletarian internationalism. The friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China is indestructible by any force. We Korean people will always be close friends of the Chinese people.
　　You are about to return to your prosperous and leaping motherland full of victory and honor, and with great hope. I am convinced that after you return to your motherland, you will give full play to the brave and selfless spirit you displayed in the Korean War and continue to make great contributions to the prosperity of your motherland.
　　I propose:
　　To the health and brilliant achievements of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers in their future work,
　　To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the leading comrades of the Government of the People's Republic of China,
　　To the eternal and unbreakable friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples,
　　To the invincible unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
　　To lasting peace in the East and the world!

    志愿军的功勋永远放射光芒
    金日成首相在欢送志愿军总部国宴上的讲话
    新华社平壤24日电　金日成首相在今晚欢送志愿军总部国宴上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的杨勇司令员同志亲爱的王平政治委员同志亲爱的英雄的中国人民志愿军官兵同志们
    今天，朝鲜人民就要最后送别在我国树立了永放光辉的功勋、即将回国的中国人民志愿军勇士们，我代表朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和全朝鲜人民，向最后一批归国的中国人民志愿军官兵们和中国人民，致以无限的感谢和崇高的荣誉。
    英雄的中国人民志愿军勇士们高举抗美援朝的神圣旗帜，跨过鸭绿江来到朝鲜，已经历时八年了。在三年艰苦的战火中，你们同朝鲜人民和人民军一起，同甘苦共患难；在战后时期，你们又给予我国劳动人民以巨大的援助，加速了我们的建设事业。这一期间，你们和我国人民之间结成了无可比拟的深厚情感。
    今天，我们人民以万分惜别心情，送别最后一批回国的中国人民志愿军勇士们。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜留下了我们人民永远不能忘记的伟大功绩。
    朝鲜战争是人类历史上最残酷的战争之一。在这一战争中，你们所发挥的无比的英雄气概和勇敢，惊动了全世界。野兽般的美帝国主义者和他的走狗们，动用了所有毒辣的、非人道的方法，肆无忌惮地制造了惨无人道的暴行。但是，敌人的暴行越加疯狂，战争越加残酷，你们就越加勇敢。当巨大的困难临头时，你们就越加发挥了英雄气概。在我们反击以美帝国主义为首的十六国武装侵略的祖国解放战争中，中国人民志愿军在保障朝鲜人民争取光辉胜利并捍卫东方持久和平上，作出了巨大的贡献。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中，给全世界人民显示了无产阶级国际主义的典范。你们一贯忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东主席给予你们的指示，帮助朝鲜人民击退了朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义。你们像热爱自己祖国一样地热爱朝鲜，同朝鲜人民军一道，以鲜血保卫了朝鲜的城市和乡村。黄继光英雄高喊着“敌人的子弹虽然能够夺去我的生命，但是它绝不能夺去亲爱的朝鲜兄弟”，用自己的胸膛堵住了敌人的射击口。黄继光英雄的这种心情，就是全体中国人民志愿军勇士们的心情。
    远离家乡的你们，把朝鲜当做自己的家乡，并把朝鲜人民当做自己的父母兄弟加以热爱。你们帮助了我国劳动人民的社会主义建设。为减轻朝鲜人民的不幸和痛苦，为他们幸福的未来，不顾任何苦难和牺牲，竭尽了自己的一切力量和热情。
    你们用双手盖起了几百所美丽的学校、许多桥梁和房屋，并且建成了许多完善的灌溉设施，直到离开朝鲜的前一天，还为朝鲜人民的幸福，为了给他们多做一件好事而尽了一切力量。在日益繁荣的我们祖国的城市和乡村里，都浸透了你们的高贵血汗和热爱。我们祖国的城市和乡村将会越发美丽，我国人民的生活也将越加幸福，我国人民也就会越加怀念你们的恩情。
    中国人民志愿军热爱人民，为人民服务的崇高的道德品质成了我国人民学习的榜样，你们一直受到了我国人民的深厚的爱戴和尊敬。你们同我国人民之间的各种动人的故事，将在日益繁荣的我国人民幸福生活里永远开放美丽的花朵。
    你们在这个土地上所流下的鲜血，将永远活在我国人民的心坎里，你们建立的伟大功勋，将同我国的山河一起永远放出光芒。
    八年来，朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军的共同斗争，史无前例地加强和发展了朝中两国人民在反对共同敌人的历史性的长期斗争中所结成的友谊和团结。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战争中所建立的辉煌功勋，是伟大的中国人民和光荣的中国共产党的骄傲，也就是全世界社会主义阵营和爱好和平人民的骄傲。你们所建立的伟大功勋是无产阶级国际主义的榜样。它将永远记载在进步人类的史册上。同志们，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜，对促进朝鲜的和平统一和缓和东方紧张局势作出了巨大的贡献。这是热爱和平的朝中两国人民力量成长了的表现，是全世界和平力量空前强大的具体表现。中国人民志愿军就要从朝鲜撤完了。但是，美帝国主义者不顾热爱和平的朝中两国人民的真挚努力，继续霸占南朝鲜，更加露骨地进行严重威胁和平的侵略政策。
    最近美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区，加紧进行破坏世界和平的严重挑衅行为。美帝国主义不顾中国人民屡次的严重警告，在台湾和中国沿海岛屿继续进行反对中国人民的侵略行为，严重地威胁着全世界的和平。
    然而，美帝国主义的任何挑衅行为，绝不能吓倒朝中两国人民。帝国主义者任意干涉他国内政和压制爱好和平人民的时代，已经一去不返了。侵略者应当正视胜利发展着的东方的新现实。从帝国主义压迫下获得了解放的以六亿五千万中国人民为首的东方各国人民，正在自豪地满怀信心地向幸福的未来胜利前进。帝国主义的任何企图也不能阻挡牢固地掌握了自己命运的东方各国人民的前进道路。
    朝鲜人民将在保卫革命的成果，反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，永远坚决地站在中国人民的这一边。美帝国主义应当尽快地从南朝鲜和台湾撤走。如果帝国主义者不顾已经有了变化的新现实，继续进行侵略政策，那么，他们一定会遭到比朝鲜战争更加严重的失败，并将被彻底地埋葬掉。
    现在朝中两国人民的力量，比八年前美帝国主义者发动朝鲜战争的时候强大了，并且继续飞跃地成长着。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在经济和政治思想战线上取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利，并且在社会主义建设中突飞猛进。在社会主义建设中的六亿五千万中国人民的革命干劲是空前高涨的，工业和农业生产中掀起了大跃进。在最近几年内提前完成在工业方面赶上和超过英国的任务是完全有可能的。贫穷和落后的旧中国一去不复返了，今天的新中国正在转变为有高度发展的工业的社会主义强国。中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的胜利，无限鼓舞了热爱和平和社会主义的全世界进步人类，并且对加强东方和全世界的社会主义力量作出了贡献。
    我国人民把中国人民所取得的巨大胜利当作自己的胜利而高兴，并且得到了无限的鼓舞。朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中正在争取巨大的成就。我国人民已经完成了国家的社会主义改造，并在我国的城市和农村掀起了社会主义建设的大高潮。现在朝鲜人民钢铁般地团结在劳动党的周围，他们的革命热情有了空前的高涨。我国全体劳动人民抱着坚定的胜利信心沿着社会主义大道跨上千里马奋勇前进。
    朝鲜人民向着在几年内把自己的祖国建成为社会主义工业国的广阔前景，并为其实现展开着英雄的斗争。我国的工人正在为提前一年半完成第一个五年计划而斗争，并为进一步提高社会主义建设速度，迅速提高劳动生产率的斗争中，发挥着无穷无尽的创造精神。我国农民为了建设不受天然灾害的富裕的社会主义农村，一致地动员起来大力进行灌溉工程，展开着显著地提高单位面积产量的斗争。他们在这一斗争中将勇敢地克服所有困难，一定会取得巨大的胜利。
    我们有把握可以向你们说：你们离开我国以后，朝鲜人民不论什么时候一定会坚固地守住自己防御线，胜利地完成祖国的和平统一和共和国北半部的社会主义建设，并将有力地捍卫和平和社会主义的东方前哨。
    朝中两国人民的友谊团结，正在日益巩固发展，我们两国人民以共同的思想和共同的理想坚固地团结在一起。
    朝鲜人民将为进一步密切同中国人民的互助合作而努力，并始终一贯地忠实于无产阶级国际主义。朝中两国人民的友谊团结，是任何力量也摧毁不了的，我们朝鲜人民永远是中国人民的亲密的朋友。
    你们满载着胜利和荣誉，怀抱着巨大的希望，即将回到繁荣的跃进的祖国了。我深信：你们回到祖国后充分地发挥在朝鲜战争中所发挥的勇敢忘我的精神，继续为自己祖国的繁荣，树立巨大的功勋。
    我提议：
    为中国人民志愿军官兵的健康和在今后工作中的辉煌成就，
    为毛泽东同志、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导同志们健康，
    为朝鲜人民和中国人民间的永恒的牢不可破的友谊团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的团结，
    为东方和全世界的持久和平干杯！
