    Former Fertile Fields Turn to Desert
    Today's Desert Turns to Fertile Fields

    The recent on-site conference on desert greening held in Lanzhou by ten provinces and regions in northern China officially declared war on the 1.6 billion mu of desert within our country. This is truly exciting news.
    The wind and sand of the northern country are well-known. Why is there sand in the wind? This reflects a sharp struggle in nature. Isn't sand just weathered stone? In terms of breaking stones and transporting sediment, wind and water are allies, but also enemies. In humid areas, the transporting activity of wind is greatly limited. Don't you see that after the streets are sprinkled with water, the wind won't raise dust? Wind is powerless to blow away wet soil. But in arid areas, the power of the wind is great: dry and loose soil is carried by the wind into the high altitude and blown away, leaving gravel on the ground; in some places, even the gravel is blown away, exposing bare rocky beaches, and desolate deserts appear.
    The tiny debris in the desert is constantly being blown away, and even larger stones are blown to slide or roll on the ground. As for the sand grains, they advance in jumps, rising and falling. Sand dunes are formed on the ground. These sand dunes move slowly and powerfully with the wind. In Yulin, Shaanxi, over the past 150 years, the desert there has moved 140 li south, forcing the Yulin county seat to be relocated three times. From this, it can be seen that the desert is not static; it is constantly expanding its sphere of influence. The rapidly changing climate in the desert, where "wear a fur coat in the morning and gauze in the afternoon, and eat watermelon by the stove," causes the rocks to weather quickly, constantly creating a lot of new gravel to replenish the "troops" needed for expansion.
    Sand covers fields and obstructs transportation. When strong winds blow, because they carry sand, they grind everything they encounter like a fast-rotating sand wheel. Solid stone pillars and statues are eroded; crops cannot withstand the invasion of wind and sand. In a wind disaster in China in 1949, 130,000 mu of pea and wheat seedlings were damaged in Xinle County, western Hebei.
    Under the rule of reactionary regimes, people watched helplessly as the wind and sand arrived, unable to defend themselves. On the contrary, sometimes due to the blind felling of forests, destruction of grasslands, and disrepair of water conservancy, they helped the destructive activities of wind and sand, turning fertile land into desert. Western Gansu in China was once a rich granary during the Han Dynasty, but later became a desert. According to a survey of seven villages in Xingtang County, Hebei, 847 mu of land were turned into sandy wasteland in the ten years from 1939 to 1949. But today, under the leadership of the Party, the people here have transformed the sandy wasteland.
    Now, the organized people of our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are planting large numbers of windbreak forests and cultivating grasslands, building reservoirs, digging wells and channels, and planting drought-resistant plants in the desert. Because water and plants are our weapons to defeat the desert. With water, the sand is not easily blown away; with water, plants can grow. On the other hand, with plants, the sand is not easy to move, and it also prevents the rapid evaporation and loss of moisture in the sand. Yulin County has planted more than 800,000 mu of trees and more than 400,000 mu of grass. A green Great Wall has been built in an area of ​​more than 100 li in length and width. The speed of desert southward movement has slowed down from 7-8 meters per year at the beginning of liberation to 2-3 meters. For example, after the completion of the reservoir in the upper reaches of the Manas River in Xinjiang, millions of mu of desert and wasteland have been turned into fertile land. In the near future, more new green "Great Walls" will appear in the northwest of our country. In our era, the word "desert" will disappear, and in Communist geology, the chapter on "geological action of wind" will have to be rewritten.

    昔日良田变沙漠
    今朝沙漠变良田
    石工
    我国北方十个省区，最近在兰州举行了绿化沙漠现场会议，正式向我国境内十六亿亩沙漠宣战。这真是令人兴奋的消息。
    北国的风沙是有名的。风中为什么会有沙呢？这又反映了自然界中一场尖锐的斗争。沙还不就是那些风化了的石头？在弄破石头、搬运泥沙这方面来说，风和水是同盟军；但同时也是敌人。在潮湿地区，风的搬运活动大大受到限制。你不见街道洒水后，风吹就不会扬尘；对于湿土，风是无力吹走的。但是在干旱地区，风的威力可大了：干燥疏松的泥土，被风带到高空吹送远方，留下砂砾铺地；有的地方连砂砾也被吹跑了，光秃秃地露出石滩，荒凉的沙漠出现了。
    沙漠里的细微的碎屑不断被吹走，便是较大的石块，也被吹得在地上滑动或是滚动。至于那些沙粒，则时起时落跳跃式地前进。地上堆成了一个个沙丘。这些沙丘，顺着风缓慢而有力地移动。在陕北榆林，一百五十年来，那里的沙漠向南移了一百四十几里，使榆林县城不得不迁移了三次。由此可见，沙漠并不是静止的，它在不断扩张自己的势力范围。而沙漠里“早穿皮袄午穿纱，守着火炉吃西瓜”冷热骤变的气候，使得岩石风化迅速，不断地造出了许多新的砂砾，补充了扩张时所需的“兵员”。
    沙复盖了田园，堵塞了交通；当刮大风的时候，由于夹带有沙子，就像飞快转动的沙轮一样，磨损着遇到的一切东西。坚固的石柱、石像都会被磨蚀；庄稼更经受不起风沙的侵袭。1949年我国的一次风灾，河北西部新乐县就有十三万亩豌豆苗和麦苗受害。
    在反动政权的统治下，人们眼睁睁看着风沙的到来，无力防御。相反地，有时由于盲目地砍伐森林，破坏草原，以及水利失修，便帮助了风沙的破坏活动，使良田成了沙漠。我国甘肃西部汉朝时曾经是富饶的粮仓，以后成了沙漠。又据河北行唐县七个村的调查，从1939到1949十年间，就有八百四十七亩田变成沙荒。但是，今天在党的领导下，这里的人民已经改造了沙荒。
    现在，组织起来的我国人民，正在中国共产党的领导下，大量种植防风林和培育草原，兴修水库，开凿井泉渠道，以及在沙漠中种上抗旱的植物等。因为水和植物是我们用来战胜沙漠的武器。有了水，沙土就不易吹走；有了水，植物就能生长。另一方面，有了植物，也使沙土不易流动，同时也防止了沙土中水分的迅速蒸发和流失。榆林县植树造林已达八十多万亩，种草四十多万亩。在纵横一百多里的地带造起了绿色的长城。沙漠南移速度从解放初每年七、八公尺减缓到二、三公尺。又如新疆玛纳斯河上游的水库建成后，就有几百万亩的沙漠和荒地变成良田。在不久的将来，我国的西北地区，将会出现更多的新的绿色的“万里长城”，在我们这个时代，“沙漠”二字将要消失，在共产主义的地质学中，将不得不重新编写“风的地质作用”这一章。
