The Birth of the Underground Blast Furnace
Jiang Tao

"Without finding a clever trick, it would be difficult to complete the furnace construction task even working twenty-four hours a day without sleep." Ma Qingzhou, the forty-odd-year-old veteran bricklayer and leader of the furnace construction team, often felt frustrated because he couldn't get the furnace construction materials he needed easily.

Since the Party Central Committee put forward the target of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year, he has been even more motivated. Thinking of Chairman Mao's concern for steel production and the happy life of the people, he felt that to ensure the completion of the steel task, he must also come up with ideas on how to build furnaces more, faster, better, and more economically. Wouldn't it be great if he could build a furnace and smelt iron without using blue bricks or fire bricks! When he thought of the steep and solid loess ridges around the factory, like city walls, he suddenly realized that he could dig an underground earthen blast furnace with the same inner diameter as a surface earthen blast furnace on the loess ridge for testing.

He finally plucked up the courage to speak out about his ideal. The workers and factory leaders supported this attempt, but some individuals believed that "using a dirt clod to smelt iron is a laughingstock." Furnace construction workers Guo Liumiao, Jiang Guozheng, and Li Fukuan, among others, even helped Ma Qingzhou study the issue of the furnace's air inlet during the debate. By this time, it was already past twelve o'clock at night, but Ma Qingzhou was determined to solve the problem that night. So, he and several workers who participated in the research went to the loess ridge outside the gate to choose a furnace site. They looked at it for a long time and found that a small earthen kiln that was originally used for cement experiments was still usable and could be used for the underground earthen blast furnace experiment. The factory leadership approved this experiment.

Early the next morning, Deputy Factory Director Jin Shishen began to doubt this experiment. Ma Qingzhou told Deputy Factory Director Jin: "We don't have a 100% guarantee of success, but we have a 60-70% chance. If we don't have any confidence, we won't conduct the experiment!" Ma Qingzhou's confidence in the success of the underground earthen blast furnace made the deputy factory director silently agree. After a day of hard work, the experimental furnace was repaired, and the iron smelting workers placed great hopes on this new initiative. On the third day, at dusk, the underground blast furnace was ignited. Ma Qingzhou and several other furnace construction workers watched intently until the molten iron flowed out before happily running back to the cafeteria for dinner. (Attached pictures)

    地下高炉的诞生
    江涛
    “不找个窍门，一天干二十四个小时不睡觉，也难完成建炉任务。”四十来岁的老瓦工、建炉组的组长马青周经常因为建炉材料不能得心应手而发闷。
    党中央提出今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的指标以后，他的干劲更大了，他想到毛主席对钢铁生产和人民幸福生活的关怀，他觉得保证钢铁任务完成，还必须在建炉如何多快好省的问题上打主意，如果不用青砖、不用耐火砖就能建炉炼铁，该是多好啊！当他想到厂周围那些像城墙一样的立陡和坚固的黄土岭的时候，他心里豁然开朗，觉得可以在土岭上挖一个同地上土高炉内径一样的地下土高炉进行试验。
    他终于鼓起勇气说出了自己的理想。工人和厂里的领导同志都支持这种尝试，但也有个别人认为“土坷廊炼铁是出洋相”。建炉工人郭留淼、蒋国政和李福宽等人，从辩论中还帮助马青周研究了炉子进风口的问题。这时候已经是深夜十二点多钟了，而马青周却坚决要在当夜解决问题。他于是和参加研究的几个工人，一起走到大门外边的土岭上去选择炉址，他们在那里端详了好久，发现原先作水泥试验的一个小土窑还好，可以利用起来作地下土高炉的试验。工厂领导上批准了这个试验。
    第二天一早，副厂长靳士申对于这种试验又发生了怀疑。马青周告诉靳副厂长：“没有十成把握成功，也有六七成，要是一点信心都没有，我们就不会进行试验！”马青周对地下土高炉成功的信心，使副厂长默然同意了。经过一天的辛勤劳动，试验炉修好了，炼铁工人对新的创举寄托着莫大的希望。在第三天傍晚，地下高炉点火了，马青周等几个建炉工人一直眼巴巴地看到铁水流出，才欢乐地跑回食堂吃饭。（附图片）
