	Old Shepherd
	—An Interview with Local Expert and "Sheep Professor" Ning Huatang
		By Our Correspondent Ma Ming
	The news that illiterate old shepherd Ning Huatang had become a university professor caused a sensation in his hometown.
	On August 20th, in Houjiao Township, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, known as the "Roof of the Taihang Mountains," a celebration meeting began on a quiet evening. The sound of gongs and drums, and the clamor, shaking the valleys and rushing into the night sky, told people that an extraordinary moment was being experienced here. At this time, Ning Huatang, who had rushed home after a six-hundred-mile journey, introduced to everyone the warm scene of him accepting the professorship certificate from the Animal Husbandry Teaching and Research Group of the Animal Husbandry Department of Shanxi Agricultural College, lecturing at the college, and being welcomed by the teachers and students of the entire college. As he spoke, he picked up the precious gifts he had brought back from afar and handed them to the leaders of the commune: a glass frame with the words "Learn from you, take you as a teacher" written on it, was a gift from all the teachers and students of the Animal Husbandry Department of Shanxi Agricultural College. Another large red satin banner with the yellow words "A Red Flag in Animal Husbandry" was a gift from the People's Committee of Shanxi Province. These things were originally given to him, but now, regardless of everyone's dissuasion, he insisted on handing them over to the commune. He said: "I was helped by everyone and cultivated by the Party. Without the Party and without the sheep in the commune, there would be no sheep-herding skills and no glory given by the Party." At the same time, twenty-five shepherds from the whole township came to congratulate this old, honored veteran who had returned from afar.
	Sheep Can "Talk"
	When I recently visited Ning Huatang in Houjiao Township, he was driving the sheep out of the pen to graze on the mountain. Suddenly, a "poof poof" sound rang out from the flock. He immediately told his apprentice: "Wait a while before letting them graze; the sheep don't want to eat the grass with dew on it." This medium-sized old shepherd has bright eyes, and his weather-beaten face reveals an expression of utmost concern for the flock. The sheep were lined up in a horizontal formation, eating and moving forward. It was obvious that there were more sheep in the middle of the horizontal line, and fewer and longer sheep on both sides. Ning Huatang told the reporter: this is his "Phoenix Spreading its Wings" formation, which allows all the sheep to eat green grass. When the sheep had finished grazing and were ready to return, he asked his apprentice to drive the sheep into a vertical formation and go down the sloping hillside. He does not let the sheep go down steep slopes to prevent the well-fed sheep from getting stomach problems. This is the "one line back" formation that he often talks about. Ning Huatang does not carry any sheep-herding tools, but with a loud roar and a whistle, the sheep respond immediately, changing formation and going down the gentle slope one after another. In an instant, he heard an unusual sound from the voices of so many sheep. He ran over, opened the sheep's mouth, and saw that its tongue was turning blue. He took out a bowl shard that looked like a sharp knife, cut the blue area under the tongue, and spat his saliva containing salt on the affected area. He said: "This is a case of 'inverted feeding'. It will be fine in a couple of days." Another sheep stared at him, making "poof poof" sounds from its nose and mouth. He felt the sheep's belly and found it was bloated from eating too much grass. He quickly fed it some human urine to help digestion.
	What amazed me was that Ning Huatang could determine many psychological states of the sheep, such as wanting to eat grass, wanting to eat salt, wanting to drink water, feeling cold, being sick, falling behind, and experiencing joy, anger, and sorrow, from their actions and calls. According to him, sheep understand many things, sheep can "talk," and sheep often watch his actions and act accordingly. I saw him stand up and walk a few steps down the slope. Immediately, the sheep in the flock began to call to each other, and all followed at his heels.
	Strolling through the mountain pasture, I heard many interesting stories of Ning Huatang's bold experiments. In the spring of 1952, the Taihang Mountains were covered with thick white snow. Lambing occurred everywhere in Lingchuan County, but none of the ewes herded by Ning Huatang lambed, and they even produced twins. This aroused his great interest, but how were the twins produced? Even he himself did not know. The commune director told him to pay special attention to solving this mystery. In the autumn of that year, the ewes were about to go into heat, and he squatted outside the pen at all times, concentrating on finding the answer to why the ewes produced twins. One day, he suddenly saw a ewe being doubly mated by two rams, and he saw the same mating phenomenon occur in other ewes. He firmly remembered the shape of these ewes, fed them salt once every half month, prevented crowding in the pen, slowed down the release of the sheep, kept them steady when climbing the mountain, avoided grazing on icy grass, and did not let them drink rapidly flowing water. Sure enough, in the spring of the following year, these ewes all produced twins. In the second year, when the ewes were in heat, he used the same double and multiple mating method and improved feeding management, causing all twenty-six ewes to produce twins again.
	In the flock of sheep that Ning Huatang herded, after six years of careful observation and bold experimentation, he finally changed the general phenomenon of ewes producing single lambs, and the miracle of many ewes producing twins occurred every year. The production of twin lambs by ewes has changed from the past of allowing blind mating to conscious artificial manipulation. In the last four years, the lambing rate of the ewes he herded has reached more than 95%, and the survival rate of the lambs is also more than 95%. The commune's flock of sheep has also grown from forty six years ago to four hundred and sixty-seven. In 1955, the sheep he herded suddenly suffered from damp poisoning, causing their hair to fall off and their skin to rot. At first, he used two traditional folk prescriptions passed down by his father, but they were ineffective. One night, after walking eighty miles of rugged mountain roads to the county town of Huguan to seek medical treatment, he also failed. Ning Huatang, who had not slept well for several days and nights, was so red-eyed that he cried anxiously. Some people even complained that he had ruined the sheep. At this time, Party branch secretary Li Gengshui encouraged him to boldly find a way to treat them. Later, he saw the sheep gnawing at the rotten area because it itched. He thought: there may be small insects inside. Since 666 powder can kill insects on crops, why can't it kill sheep insects? He immediately tried washing with a solution of 666 powder. As a result, many dead insects were found in the washed rotten area the next day. To enhance the insecticidal power, he also added several kinds of folk medicinal materials and dissolved them with 666 powder, using this medicinal water to wash all the sheep. This day, from morning to night, Ning Huatang was so busy that he did not even have time to eat. After a few days, the sheep's mange was cured.
	Ning Huatang's familiarity with the life of sheep to such an astonishing degree is not accidental. In the long years of the past forty years, he ran in the high mountains and dense forests of the Taihang Mountains, herding a total of more than 35,000 sheep and treating various sheep diseases more than 40,000 times. He has personally handled 138 twin lambs produced by ewes. In order to study the life of sheep and ensure their normal development, he carefully observed the laws of seasonal and climatic changes in Huixian County, Henan and Lingchuan County, Shanxi, and found ways to prevent sheep from being attacked by natural disasters such as frost, floods, and hail. He is familiar with the properties and growth conditions of dozens of wild medicinal materials and forage grasses. In addition, he also studied the reproduction, growth, and development process of sheep and the five internal organs of the sheep's body, thereby exploring more than one hundred ways to prevent and treat sheep diseases and poisoning from eating poisonous grass. Sometimes he also dissects dead sheep to find the cause of death and learn from experience.
	Advancing along this path of perseverance, hard work, and realism has enabled him to uncover the secrets of sheep life and systematically accumulate a set of mature sheep-herding experiences. These are: according to seasonal changes, the growth of pasture, and the development of sheep, he has explored the sheep-herding laws of the four seasons: graze on the sunny slopes in February and August, graze on the shady slopes from April to August, graze on the ground from September to October, and graze on the sunny slopes again in December and January. Based on many years of experience, he has explored that sheep develop their bones in the spring and should avoid running around. Summer and autumn are important seasons for the overall development of sheep in a year, so he grazes them every day by "driving the sheep to meet the sun in the morning, letting them eat grass only when the sun turns red, seizing the time to eat hot grass at noon, and eating a 'return grass' later on." This method of grazing makes the sheep strong and fat.
	Days and Nights in the Mountains
	Living in the mountains day and night, Ning Huatang is not afraid of the high mountains and difficult roads, nor is he afraid of being harassed by wild animals. He regards fighting against harmful beasts as his human joy. Long-term struggle practice has made him dare to conquer any wild beasts that endanger the flock of sheep. One night when treading the wild enclosure, it was raining heavily. He was awakened from his sleep by the sound of sheep, and it turned out that a leopard had broken into the sheepfold. He didn't have time to put on his clothes, and jumped into the sheepfold naked, picked up a stone and hit the leopard head-on. The leopard was driven away, and the sheep suffered no loss. Another time a sheep was eaten by a leopard. The angry Ning Huatang and his companions set up a land gun and broke the leopard's right leg. They hurriedly followed the bloodstains of the injured leopard, tracking and chasing it, but accidentally walked into a mountain ditch. The leopard pounced from behind a stone on the side of the road, biting the shoulder of his companion Zhao Heiniu. Zhao Heiniu grabbed the leopard's injured leg with one hand and supported the leopard's neck with his head. Ning Huatang swung his axe and struck the leopard's back with force. The leopard turned around and pounced on Ning Huatang. Ning Huatang used all his strength and struck the leopard's mouth with the axe again. The leopard's mouth and nose were bleeding. After a moment of fighting, the leopard was killed by them.
	Always For the Collective
	The Party's education of Ning Huatang last year is something he will never forget. Once, he was dissatisfied with the commune members' criticism of the sheep eating some crops and wanted to resign from his position as a shepherd, but was criticized by the branch secretary. Once, some shepherds wrote big-character posters criticizing him for his conservative residual ideology of possessing some sheep-herding experience for himself during the rural rectification movement. At first, Ning Huatang felt very wronged: the wind, the sun, the rain, and the frost, everyone cannot see my achievements, but they are always finding faults? Some technologies are what I have explored in the wind and rain for decades. Can I do without keeping some backhand techniques? Party branch secretary Li Gengshui understood his mood and told him: everyone recognizes your experience and your great contribution to the commune, but you should not reject everyone's correct criticism! You want to resign from your position as a shepherd, who are you resigning to? Whose are the sheep? Li Gengshui also understood that his conservatism in some technologies was inseparable from his long-term lonely and poor life before liberation. He asked him whether his resignation and his selfish conservatism in some technologies were for himself or for the collective? He advised him to contribute his sheep-herding experience, which used to serve his personal life, and turn it into the collective's wealth.
	The serious persuasion made him ponder in the memories of the past:
	He remembered his unfortunate past: his family had been working as long-term shepherds for landlords for four generations. In the old society, shepherds were subjected to torment and persecution, and sheep-herding science and technology were also devastated. Every year on the 20th day of the tenth lunar month, when the "sheep market" came, the landlords would enjoy admiring the sheep's tricks. The landlords and their relatives and friends came to the "Lord's Temple" in eight-carried sedan chairs, wearing silk and satin clothes, to admire the green sheep, jujube-red sheep, and various flower sheep.
	He also remembered his life after liberation. Since 1956, he had attended the Shanxi Province and Lingchuan County Rural Socialist Activist Conferences, received banners and bonuses, and his sheep-herding technical experience had been highly evaluated. People called him a local expert and a sheep professor. Ning Huatang has stood up straight and become the master of society.
	Recalling the different treatment of working people and animal husbandry science and technology under the two social systems, Ning Huatang shed tears. He told the branch secretary: Under the leadership of the Party, I have completely turned over, I want everyone to be well, and I must never forget my roots or be selfish, and always be for the collective...
	Since then, he has smeared mud on the trees near the road to prevent the sheep from gnawing on the trees, and tried to accumulate more sheep manure to meet the needs of agricultural production increase. During lambing in the spring, he and his wife were afraid that the lambs would freeze, so they drove the sheep to their home, helping with the delivery and feeding the sheep. They also held the lambs on the kang and covered them with cotton quilts. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient lamb milk, he also took his family's millet to boil rice soup to feed the sheep. Sometimes, he squeezed the ewes' milk to raise the lambs. Over the past year, he has also traveled to all the sheep flocks in the county. Taking advantage of the opportunity to visit and attend provincial and county agricultural and animal husbandry conferences, he promoted sheep-herding experience and publicized the ancestral secrets of producing twin lambs by ewes and treating sheep diseases such as appendicitis, fecal worms, and snake bites, which were previously "kept secret". He has also trained more than twenty shepherds who are familiar with sheep-herding experience. Once, he heard that the sheep flock of the Linghoudi Agricultural Cooperative had mange, and he walked sixty miles in the dark to help cure it before returning.
	A New Beginning
	Ning Huatang's enthusiasm is growing. He bought two Merino sheep from the plain area, preparing to change the habits of Merino sheep that cannot climb steep slopes and are not convenient for walking on mountain roads through experiments, and gradually cultivate a new breed of sheep suitable for mountain breeding. This new breed of sheep with long fibers will increase from the existing two to forty to fifty in two years. He is stepping up various tasks such as grazing sheep in separate groups, improving sheep breeds, and increasing the autumn fat of sheep. He has also begun to learn to read at night, determined to make up for his lack of culture. (Attached pictures)

    老羊工
    ——访土专家、羊教授宁华堂
        本报记者　马明
    不识字的老羊工——宁华堂当了大学教授的喜讯，轰动了他的家乡。
    8月20日，在被称为“太行山屋脊”的山西省陵川县后郊乡里，贺喜大会在一个宁静的夜晚开始了。震荡山谷、冲向夜空的锣鼓声、喧闹声，告诉人们：这里正在经历着一个不平凡的时刻。这时，经过六百里行程赶回家乡的宁华堂，向大家介绍了他接受山西农学院畜牧系家畜教研组教授聘书、在这个学院讲坛上讲课和全院师生欢迎的热烈情景。他一边说，一边拿起这次远道带回的珍贵礼品，递到社干部的手里：一个玻璃镜框上写着“向你学习，拜你为师”，是山西农学院畜牧系全体师生送给的。另一面大红缎奖旗上有“畜牧业的一面红旗”的黄色字样，是山西省人民委员会送给的。这些东西，本来都是送给他的，如今他不顾大家的劝阻，无论如何要交给社里。他说：“我是大家帮助和党培养起来的。离开党、离开社里的羊群，放羊技术和党给的光荣也就没有了”。同时，全乡二十五个羊工还为这位满载荣誉远道归来的同行老前辈前来祝贺。
    羊会“说话”
    我最近到后郊乡访问宁华堂的时候，他正从圈里赶出羊群上山牧放。羊群里忽然响起噗噗的声音，他立刻告诉学徒：“等一会再放，羊嫌草上有露水不吃。”这位中等身材的老羊工，有一双明亮的眼睛，在他久经风霜的脸面上，流露出一种对羊群关怀备至的表情。羊群排着横队边吃边前进，明显地可以看出在横队的中部羊多，两边羊少而长，宁华堂告诉记者：这就是他的放牧方法中的“凤凰双展翅”队形，可以使羊群都能吃到青草。当羊群牧放完毕准备返回，他让学徒把羊群赶成纵队，沿着斜山坡下去。不让羊下陡坡，防止使饱肚的羊闹胃病。这是他经常说的“回头一条线”的放牧队形。宁华堂手里不带任何放羊工具，但是猛吼一声、打个口哨，一呼羊百应，羊群立即变换队形，沿着缓山坡鱼贯而下，霎时，他又从那么多羊的叫声中，听出一种异样的声音，跑过去剥开那只羊的嘴巴一看，舌下已经发青。拿出一块像快刀一样的碗片，割破发青的舌下，又把他嘴里含着食盐的唾沫吐在患处。他说：“这是一种倒食病，过两天就好了。”另一只羊的眼睛盯着他，从鼻子里和嘴里发出噗噗的声音，他便摸摸那只羊的肚皮，发现吃草过猛胃胀，很快喂点人尿帮助消化。
    使我惊奇的是，羊想吃草、想吃盐、想喝水、嫌冷、患病、掉队和喜怒哀乐等许多反映心理状态的动作和叫声，宁华堂都能判断出来，按照他的说法，羊懂得许多事情，羊是会“说话”的，羊群也常看他的动作行事。我看到他站起来，往下坡走了几步。羊群里立刻响起互相召唤的咩咩声，都跟着他的脚后跟跑起来。
    漫步在山野的牧场上，听到宁华堂许多大胆试验的趣事。1952年的春天，千山万壑的太行山上，铺满了厚厚的皑皑白雪，陵川县到处发生了母羊落羔的现象，只有宁华堂放牧的母羊没有落羔，还产了双羔。这件事引起了他的很大兴趣，可是双羔究竟是怎样生产的？连他自己也不知道。社主任对他说要特意留神解开这个谜。就在这年秋天，母羊快要发情了，他时刻蹴在圈的外边，全神贯注地找寻母羊产双羔的答案。一天，突然看到一只母羊，被两只公羊进行了双配复配，又看到另外一些母羊发生同样的交配现象。他把这些母羊的形状牢牢记在心里，每半月给他们吃一次盐，进圈防挤，出圈要慢，上山要稳，不放冰凌草，不饮急流水。到了第二年春天，真的这些母羊都产了双羔。他在第二年母羊发情的时候，用这种同样双配复配和改善饲养管理的办法，使二十六只母羊全部又产了双羔。
    宁华堂在他所牧放的羊群里，经过这样六年的仔细观察、大胆试验，终于改变了一般母羊产单羔的现象，年年都有许多母羊产双羔的奇迹出现。母羊产双羔已经由过去听任羊的盲目交配，变成自觉的由人工操纵了。最近四年，他放牧的母羊，产羔率达到95％以上，小羊的成活率也在95％以上。全社的羊群也由六年前的四十只，繁殖到四百六十七只了。他放牧的羊群，在1955年，突然因中湿毒，毛脱落、皮腐烂。开始，他用父亲口传的两种土法配方治疗无效。一天夜晚，往返奔走八十里的崎岖山路，到壶关县城设法医治也失败了。几个昼夜没睡好觉的宁华堂，熬的眼都红了，焦急的哭了。有些人竟埋怨是他把羊搞坏了。正在这时，党支部书记李根水鼓励他大胆设法治疗。后来他看到羊用嘴啃烂处叫痒。便想：里面可能有小虫，既然六六六粉能杀农作物的虫，难道不能杀死羊虫吗？他马上用六六六粉溶液试洗。结果第二天洗过的烂处有许多杀死的小虫。为增强杀虫的力量，又增加了几种土药材，和六六六粉溶化在一起，用这种药水给全部羊洗了一遍。这天从早到晚，宁华堂忙得连饭也没顾得吃，过了几天，羊的癞病都治好了。
    宁华堂对羊生活熟悉到这种惊人程度，不是偶然的。他在过去四十年的漫长岁月，奔跑在山高林又密的太行山里，前后共放羊三万五千多只，治疗羊的各种疾病四万多只次，他经手母羊产的双羔有一百三十八只。为了研究羊的生活和保证羊的正常发育，他在河南辉县和山西陵川两县，仔细观察了各种季节、气候变换的规律，找出预防羊受霜冻、洪、雹等自然灾害侵袭的办法；熟悉了几十种野生药材和牧草的性能和生长状况，此外还研究了羊的繁殖、成长、发育过程和羊身体的五脏六腑，从而摸索到一百多种防治羊病和羊吃毒草中毒的办法。有时他还解剖已经死亡的羊找寻死亡原因接受经验教训。
    沿着这条坚韧、刻苦和求实的实践道路前进，使他揭开了羊生活的秘密，而且系统地积累了一套成熟的牧羊经验。这就是：根据季节的变换、牧草的生长和羊的发育情况，摸索出一年四季的牧羊规律：2、8月里放阳坡，4至8月放阴坡，9月10月放地垛，腊月正月又阳坡。他根据多年的经验摸索到羊在春季是发育骨胳，应该避免羊乱跑，夏秋两季是羊在一年中全面发育的重要季节，他便在每天放牧上“早晨赶羊迎太阳，太阳放红才吃草，中午抓紧吃热草，后响吃个回头草”。这种放牧的办法，使羊一个个体壮膘肥。
  山野里的日日夜夜
    日日夜夜生活在山野里的宁华堂，不怕山高路难行，不怕野兽来骚扰，把与害兽作斗争，当作自己的人间乐趣。长期的斗争实践，使他敢于征服任何危害羊群的野兽。有一天踩野圈的夜晚，滂沱大雨，从睡梦中被羊的叫声惊醒，原来是一只豹闯进了羊圈。他来不及穿衣服，赤身裸体，跳进羊圈，搬起一块石头向豹迎面击去，豹被赶走，羊没有受到损失。另一次一只羊被豹吃了，愤怒的宁华堂和同伴安置了地枪，把豹的右腿打断。他们急忙踏着受伤豹的血迹，跟踪追击，不料走进一条山沟里，豹从路旁石头后边扑来。咬破同伴赵黑牛的肩膀，赵黑牛一手抓住豹受伤的腿，用头顶住豹的脖子。宁华堂用斧头又向豹的脊背猛力砍去，豹又转身向宁华堂扑来，宁华堂用尽全身的力量，再拿斧头向豹的嘴巴砍去，这个豹的口鼻都出血了，搏斗片刻，豹被他们打死。
    永远为集体
    去年党对宁华堂的教育，是他永远不会忘记的。一次是他不满意社员们对羊群吃了一些庄稼的批评，要辞退羊工职务，受到支部书记的批评。一次是有些羊工在农村整风运动中，写大字报批评他把一些牧羊经验据为私有的保守残余思想。开始，宁华堂觉得太委屈了：风吹日晒、雨打霜冻，我的成绩大家都看不到，偏偏找毛病？有些技术那是我几十年风里雨里摸到的，不保留一些后手能行吗？党支部书记李根水了解他的这种心情，告诉他：谁都承认你的经验和对社的巨大贡献，可是你不该拒绝大家的正确批评呀！你要辞退羊工职务，你向谁辞退？羊是谁的？李根水也懂得他在某些技术上的保守，是和他在解放前长期孤独、穷困的生活分不开。向他提出闹辞退职务、某些技术上的自私保守是为了个人，还是为了集体？劝告他应该把过去为谋求个人生活服务的放羊经验，贡献出来，变为集体的财富。
    严肃的劝说，使他沉思在往事的回忆里：
    他想起自己充满不幸的过去：他家四辈子都是给地主当长工放羊。在旧社会放羊人遭受折磨、迫害，放羊的科学技术也受到摧残。每年阴历10月20日，遇到“羊市”，地主们便以欣赏羊的花样玩乐。地主和他们的亲友乘坐八抬轿来到“老爷庙”，身穿绫罗绸缎衣裳，前来观赏青羊、枣红羊和各种花羊。
    他又想起了解放以后的生活，从1956年以来，他出席了山西省和陵川县农村社会主义积极分子大会，受到奖旗、奖金，他的放羊技术经验，得到了很高的评价，人们叫他土专家、羊教授。宁华堂已经挺起腰板站起来成为社会的主人。
    回忆两种社会制度下面，劳动人民和畜牧科学技术所受到的不同待遇，宁华堂掉下眼泪来。他告诉支部书记：我在党的领导下彻底翻身，要好大家好，绝对不能忘本、自私，永远为集体……
    从此，他在靠近路旁的树上涂了泥土，防止羊啃坏树木，设法多积羊粪，满足农业增产的需要。春天产羔时，他和爱人恐怕羊羔受冻，把羊赶到自己的家里，一面接产，一面喂羊。并且把小羊抱在坑上，盖上棉被。为了解决羊羔奶不足的困难，又拿上他家的小米熬米汤喂羊。有时挤下母羊的奶抚育小羊。一年来，他还跑遍了全县所有的羊群。利用登门拜访和出席全省、全县农业畜牧会议的机会，传播放羊经验，把过去“保密”的母羊产双羔、治疗阑尾炎、粪虫、毒蛇咬等羊病的祖传秘方，也都公开出来。他还培养了二十多个熟悉放羊经验的羊工，有一次，听说岭后底农业社的羊群发生癞病，他摸黑行走六十里，帮助医好后才回来。
    新的开始
    宁华堂的劲头越干越大了。他从平川地区买回两只绵羊，准备经过试验改变绵羊不能爬陡坡、不便走山路的习性，逐渐培养一种适合山地饲养的新羊种。这种纤维长的新羊种，二年后将由现有的两只增加至四十至五十只。他正在抓紧进行各种羊分群放牧、改良羊种和增加羊的秋膘等工作。他还开始在晚上认字，决心要补起文化缺门。（附图片）
