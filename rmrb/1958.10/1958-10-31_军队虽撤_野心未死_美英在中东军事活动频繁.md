Troops Withdraw, Ambitions Remain
    US and British Military Activity Frequent in the Middle East

    (By Our Correspondent) Although the United States and Britain were forced to withdraw their invading troops from Lebanon and Jordan, they have not relaxed their military activities in the Middle East in the slightest. From the Persian Gulf to North Africa, the US and Britain are colluding and actively deploying military forces in areas neighboring Iraq and the United Arab Republic.
    After the original military plan of the Baghdad Pact Group was bankrupted by the victory of the Iraqi revolution, a new military plan has been redrawn under the instigation of the United States. "Iran Echo" acknowledged that the new military plan "is not only to deal with Russia, but also to deal with Arab countries." In order to accelerate the implementation of the new military plan, Norstad, Supreme Commander of the NATO forces in Europe, US Assistant Secretary of the Army Short, and US Secretary of Defense McElroy successively visited Ankara, Tehran, and Karachi, and held talks with the Turkish, Iranian, and Pakistani authorities. According to Rome's "National Evening News," the United States and Turkey have reached an agreement stipulating that the US Air Force, paratroopers, and armored forces will be stationed for a long time at the Adana base near the United Arab Republic. Missile launch sites will also be built soon. In addition, the Turkish army, the most ferocious tool of the US aggression against Arab countries, will be strengthened by US military assistance. US Assistant Secretary of the Army Short said: In view of Turkey's geographical location, its army "should be equipped with modern weapons as much as possible." In Iran, the United States is carrying out large-scale construction and expansion projects for military bases and military airports in areas near Ahvaz and Lake Rezaiyeh in Iraq, with 2,000 American "military experts" participating in the construction. US Secretary of Defense McElroy held talks with Iran on concluding a military treaty.
    The Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf region are the focus of US and British military activities. Shortly after the US and British troops invaded Lebanon and Jordan, Britain increased its warships and ground forces to the Persian Gulf region, and the United States also carried out active activities, demanding the right to build a military base on Bahrain Island in the Persian Gulf at a cost of $200 million. The US Naval Commander in the Middle East, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, the Commander of the Pakistani Fleet, and Iranian military leaders held an important military meeting in Tehran in September. Shortly thereafter, the United States announced the establishment of the Indian Ocean Fleet, one of whose purposes is to strengthen control over the Persian Gulf region, threaten the Republic of Iraq, and cooperate with Britain to strengthen the suppression of the national independence movement in the Arabian Peninsula. From November 2 to November 21, the navies of the Baghdad Pact member states and the United States will conduct naval exercises in the North Arabian Sea. This will be the first large-scale military threat activity since the US and Britain were forced to withdraw their troops from Lebanon and Jordan.
    The US and Britain have recently provided Israel with tens of millions of dollars worth of military weapons, including artillery and submarines. Israel's "Haaretz" revealed that the United States will continue to "undertake clear obligations to Israel," using Israel to resist the Arab national independence movement. As for Jordan, which is known as the "strategic kingdom," the United States sent a military delegation to study the issue of strengthening the Jordanian army long before the British army withdrew. After the British army withdrew from Jordan, it left behind some officers to serve as "experts" in the Jordanian army headquarters. The United States has also sent a military delegation to Jordan. The United States believes that it will control this strategic location adjacent to Iraq and the United Arab Republic "at all costs."
    In addition, the garrison of the British base in Libya, which is adjacent to the Egyptian region of the United Arab Republic, will also be increased.

### 军队虽撤　野心未死  美英在中东军事活动频繁

    军队虽撤　野心未死
    美英在中东军事活动频繁
    本报讯　美英两国虽然被迫从黎巴嫩和约旦撤走了侵略军队，但是它们并没有丝毫放松在中东地区的军事活动。从波斯湾到北非，美英狼狈为奸，正在伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国邻近地区积极布置军事力量。
    巴格达条约集团原来的军事计划，由于伊拉克革命胜利，遭到破产后，在美国主使下，一个新的军事计划已经重新拟订出来。“伊朗回声报”承认，新的军事计划“不仅是为了对付俄国，而且也是为了对付阿拉伯国家”。为了加速实现新的军事计划，北大西洋集团驻欧洲武装部队总司令诺斯塔德、美国陆军部长助理肖特、美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊等曾先后访问了安卡拉、德黑兰和卡拉奇，同土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦当局举行了会谈。据罗马“国家晚报”透露，美、土之间已经达成协议，规定美国空军、伞兵和装甲部队长驻邻近阿拉伯联合共和国的亚达那基地。导弹发射场也即将兴建。另外，美国侵略阿拉伯国家的最凶恶的工具土耳其军队，将由于美国的军事援助而得到加强。美国陆军部长助理肖特说：鉴于土耳其的地理位置，它的军队“应该尽可能配备现代化武器”。在伊朗，美国正在邻近伊拉克阿瓦土市和雷萨埃湖附近等地区，大规模地进行军事基地和军用机场的新建和扩建工程，参加建筑工程的美国“军事专家”达两千人。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊曾同伊朗举行了缔结军事条约的会谈。
    阿拉伯海和波斯湾地区是美、英两国加强军事活动的重点地区。在美英两国军队侵入黎巴嫩和约旦以后不久，英国便增调军舰和地面部队到波斯湾地区，美国也进行了积极活动，要求以二亿美元的代价取得在波斯湾内的巴林岛上建筑军事基地的权利。美国在中东的海军司令、中东英国部队总司令、巴基斯坦舰队司令和伊朗军事领袖，并在9月间在德黑兰举行重要军事会议。其后不久，美国便宣布成立印度洋舰队，其目的之一，就是加强对波斯湾地区的控制，威胁伊拉克共和国并协同英国加强镇压阿拉伯半岛的民族独立运动。11月2日到11月21日，巴格达条约集团成员国和美国的海军将在北阿拉伯海进行海军演习。这将是美英被迫自黎巴嫩和约旦撤军以后第一次大规模军事威胁活动。
    对于以色列，美英两国在不久以前已分别提供了数千万美元的军火武器，包括大炮和潜水艇。以色列的“国土报”透露，美国将继续“对以色列承担明确的义务”，利用以色列抵制阿拉伯民族独立运动。对于号称“战略王国”的约旦。早在英军撤出以前，美国便派出了军事代表团研究加强约旦陆军的问题。英军撤出约旦后，留下了一些军官，充当约旦陆军总部的“专家”。美国也已派了一个军事代表团到约旦去。美国认为将“不惜一切代价”控制这块和伊拉克、阿拉伯联合共和国相邻的战略要地。
    此外，紧邻阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区的利比亚的英国基地驻军，也将有所增加。
