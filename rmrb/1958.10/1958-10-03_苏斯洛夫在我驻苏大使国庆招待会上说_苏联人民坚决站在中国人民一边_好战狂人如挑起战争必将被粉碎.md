Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 2nd. At the reception held by Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao on October 1st to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Suslov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said that if brutal, irrational madmen provoke a war against the People's China, they will certainly be crushed by the joint actions of China, the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving forces of the world. Referring to the fact that U.S. imperialism is supplying Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique with missile weapons and intensifying its harassment and provocations against China, he pointed out that any "Sidewinder" missiles would be of no avail.

In his speech, Comrade Suslov severely condemned the U.S. imperialists' military provocations in China's territory of Taiwan. He pointed out that all the Soviet people firmly stand on the side of the Chinese people, and they fully support Comrade Khrushchev's solemn warnings to the U.S. aggressors regarding the situation in the Taiwan region.

In his speech, Suslov warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. Suslov pointed out that the People's Republic of China is becoming increasingly strong, and its international prestige is growing day by day. Although certain imperialist groups are foolishly and hopelessly trying to isolate the country, the People's Republic of China is consistently striving for lasting peace and opposing colonialism and imperialist aggression. This struggle has won the warm sympathy of all peace-loving and progressive forces. Among the friends of New China, 200 million Soviet people stand at the forefront. A truly fraternal friendship has formed and is constantly strengthening between the people of the Soviet Union and China, which is a strong fortress for defending world peace and an important pillar for consolidating the strength of the entire socialist camp. In his speech, Suslov warmly congratulated all the Chinese people on the glorious 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Ambassador Liu Xiao said at the reception that Comrade Khrushchev's two solemn warnings to the United States on the situation in the Taiwan Strait fully demonstrated the greatest support of the Soviet people for the Chinese people and powerfully demonstrated the great strength and determination to oppose aggression of the great Sino-Soviet alliance.

He said that the Chinese people's determination to liberate their territory of Taiwan and other coastal islands is absolutely unshakable. The rapid development and growth of New China cannot be stopped by any imperialist force. Victory will surely belong to the Chinese people who adhere to the just struggle.

In his speech, Ambassador Liu Xiao also expressed his gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their selfless assistance to China's socialist construction.

Attending the reception were Soviet Party and government leaders such as Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Suslov, Furtseva, Kosygin, heads of government ministries, marshals, generals, heads of mass organizations, people from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union, totaling hundreds of people.

The reception proceeded in an extremely friendly and joyful atmosphere, with guests and hosts frequently toasting to the health of Chairman Mao and Comrade Khrushchev, and to the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. (Photo attached)

    苏斯洛夫在我驻苏大使国庆招待会上说
    苏联人民坚决站在中国人民一边  好战狂人如挑起战争必将被粉碎
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联共产党中央委员会书记处书记苏斯洛夫1日在中国驻苏联大使刘晓举行的庆祝中国国庆九周年的招待会上说，横暴的、失去理智的狂人如果对人民中国挑起战争，那么它一定会被中国、苏联和全世界和平力量的共同行动所粉碎。他在谈到美帝国主义供应蒋介石卖国集团导弹武器并加紧对中国的骚扰和挑衅时指出：任何“响尾蛇”导弹也是无济于事的。
    苏斯洛夫同志在讲话中严厉地谴责了美帝国主义者在中国领土台湾的军事挑衅罪行。他指出，全体苏联人民坚决地站在中国人民一边，他们完全拥护赫鲁晓夫同志就台湾地区局势向美国侵略者提出的严正警告。
    苏斯洛夫在讲话中热烈地赞扬了中国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。苏斯洛夫指出，中华人民共和国日益坚强，它的国际威信日益增长。虽然某一些帝国主义集团愚蠢无望地企图孤立这个国家，但中华人民共和国始终不渝地争取持久和平，反对殖民主义和帝国主义的侵略。这一斗争取得了所有爱好和平和进步力量的热烈同情。在新中国的朋友当中，两亿苏联人民站在最前列。苏中两国人民之间已形成了，而且正在不断地加强着真正兄弟般的友谊，这种友谊是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒，是巩固整个社会主义阵营威力的重要支柱。苏斯洛夫在讲话中热烈地向全体中国人民祝贺中华人民共和国光荣的九周年国庆。
    刘晓大使在招待会上说，赫鲁晓夫同志就台湾海峡地区局势问题向美国提出的两次严正警告充分表现了苏联人民对中国人民的最大支持，有力地显示了伟大的中苏同盟的强大力量和反对侵略的决心。
    他说，中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和其他沿海岛屿的决心是绝对不可动摇的。新中国的迅速发展和壮大是任何帝国主义力量所阻挡不住的。胜利一定属于坚持正义斗争的中国人民。
    刘晓大使在讲话中还对苏联政府和人民对中国社会主义建设所给予的无私援助表示感谢。
    出席招待会的有阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、苏斯洛夫、福尔采娃、柯西金等苏联党和政府领导人、政府各部负责人、元帅、将军们、群众团体负责人、各界社会人士和各国驻苏联外交使节等数百人。
    招待会在极为友好、欢快的气氛中进行，宾主频频为毛主席和赫鲁晓夫同志的健康、为中苏两国人民的友谊干杯。（附图片）
