    Promote "Rural Work Style" and "Guerrilla Habits"
    Wang Wendao
    After we communists entered the city, we often heard people mocking us. Because we didn't quite understand the bourgeoisie's lifestyle, didn't quite respect the bourgeoisie's legal system, didn't handle affairs according to so-called "procedures," and didn't differentiate between superiors and subordinates, they ridiculed us for having "guerrilla habits" and a "rural work style." Some comrades felt very ashamed after being scolded like this; some individuals even greedily started learning from them. Over time, some people began to pick up many bad habits. Some began to talk about official positions, compete for treatment, demand status, and want cars..., forgetting our excellent traditions of unity between superiors and subordinates, unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the army and the people, sharing weal and woe with the working people, engaging in production and labor, working even when we don't eat well, and making revolution even when we don't sleep well. As our Party Central Committee stated in its May 10, 1957 directive on cadres at all levels participating in physical labor: "Now, many comrades are influenced by the ideology of the old society's exploiting classes, forgetting these fine traditions of the past, looking down on physical labor, fostering a habit of coveting fame, fortune, and status, and some people only hope to separate themselves from production, and once they have separated themselves from production, they are unwilling to return to production. This is a very dangerous tendency."
    These comrades didn't see that when people scolded us, it was the bourgeoisie attacking us, the exploiting classes attacking Marxism-Leninism and communism. Instead, they saw it as if everything we had wasn't Marxist-Leninist or communist, and they listened to people's attacks and accepted their influence. Of course, because of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our entire Party was not overthrown by their attacks, and after many rectification campaigns, our entire Party is still advancing healthily and victoriously. But indeed, some people were pulled over by them. Now it seems that not all of us are completely healthy; we are still bound by many remnants of bourgeois legal rights, and we have not yet restored the revolutionary spirit of the past "rural work style" and "guerrilla habits." Of course, I am not saying here that we should restore the bad habits of the past, such as laxity and small-scale handicraft methods, but rather that we should restore those good things that are actually the spirit of communism but have been wrongly labeled with the crimes of "rural work style" and "guerrilla habits."
    Now it seems that restoring those "rural work style" and "guerrilla habits" is very urgent, and they should also be greatly promoted. This is not only because those things were originally Marxist-Leninist and communist, but also because we are now able to put the construction of a communist society on the agenda, and we must immediately conduct communist education for all the people from now on. Then how can we ignore the communist things we already have? Now is the time to use them more systematically and promote them greatly.
    We want the combination of mental and physical labor, and we want to truly integrate with the masses of the people. We want to thoroughly destroy all bourgeois legal systems, and we can consider abolishing the wage system and restoring the supply system. We want to greatly promote communist morality, each according to his ability, and each according to his needs. Don't engage in calculating work by the hour, giving money for overtime, valuing material things over ideology. In the past few decades of struggle, so many comrades sacrificed themselves; who wanted money? During the 25,000-li Long March, we engaged in large-scale production; who wanted money? Now that we are fighting for the construction of communism, we must have an even stronger communist spirit. "Rural work style" and "guerrilla habits" are very good! This will not make us special or detached from the masses, but will enable us to move towards communism quickly. Restore these communist traditions! Smash everything of the bourgeoisie and restore "rural work style" and "guerrilla habits"! This is not a "regression," it is progress!

    发扬“农村作风”和“游击习气”
    王文刀
    我们共产党人进城以后，常常听到有人嘲笑我们。那些人因为我们不大懂得资产阶级的那一套生活方式、不大尊重资产阶级的那一套法权制度，办事不按所谓“章程”，待人不分上下，便讥讽我们是“游击习气”和“农村作风”。有些同志经过人家这么一骂，于是便觉得丢脸得很；甚至个别人便贪得无厌地向人家学了起来。久而久之就有些人开始沾染上了许多坏习气。有人开始讲官职，争待遇，要地位，要汽车……，把我们那上下一致、官兵一致、军民打成一片和劳动人民同甘共苦、生产劳动、吃不好也工作、睡不好也干革命等等优良传统都忘掉了。正如我们党中央在1957年5月10日关于各级领导人员参加体力劳动的指示中所说的：“现在有不少同志受旧社会剥削阶级的思想影响，忘记过去的这种优良传统，看不起体力劳动，滋长了一种贪图名利地位的习气，并且有一部分人只希望脱离生产，而在脱离生产以后即不愿意再回到生产中去。这是非常危险的倾向。”
    这些同志没有看到人家骂我们，那是资产阶级对我们的攻击，是剥削阶级攻击马列主义，攻击共产主义。反而看成好像我们所有的那些并不是马列主义、共产主义，而听从人家的攻击，接受人家的影响。当然因为有党中央和毛主席的正确领导，我们整个党并没有被他们攻击倒，而且我们经过多次的整风，我们全党仍然是健康地胜利地前进着。但的确也有一部分人被人家拉过去了。现在看来在我们许多人身上并不是全都健康的，还被资产阶级残留下来的许多法权所束缚着，还没有恢复过去那样的“农村作风”和“游击习气”的革命精神。当然我这里说的并不是要我们恢复过去那些不好的散漫、小手工业方式的作风，而是要恢复那些实际上是共产主义精神的却被妄加上“农村作风”、“游击习气”罪名的好东西。
    现在看来，要恢复那些“农村作风”、“游击习气”十分迫切，而且还应当大大发扬光大。这不仅因为那些东西本来就是马列主义的、共产主义的。而且也因为现在我们已经有可能把建设共产主义社会提到议事日程上来了，并且从现在起就要立即对全体人民进行共产主义的教育。那么对于我们早已有的共产主义的东西，怎么能置之不理呢？现在正应该把它更有系统的利用起来，而且加以发扬光大。
    我们要脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，我们要作到同人民群众真正打成一片。我们要彻底破坏资产阶级的一切法权制度，可以考虑不要工资制，恢复供给制。我们要大大讲共产主义道德，各尽所能，各取所需，不要搞什么按钟头计算工作，加班了就给钱，重物质而不要思想。过去几十年斗争，牺牲了那么多同志，谁要过钱来？二万五千里长征，大搞生产，谁要过钱来？现在要为建设共产主义而奋斗了，这就更要有共产主义的精神。“农村作风”、“游击习气”，好得很！这不会使我们特殊化、脱离群众，而使我们能很快的走向共产主义。恢复这些共产主义的传统吧！把资产阶级的一切一切统统打掉，恢复“农村作风”、“游击习气”吧！这不是“倒退”，这是前进！
