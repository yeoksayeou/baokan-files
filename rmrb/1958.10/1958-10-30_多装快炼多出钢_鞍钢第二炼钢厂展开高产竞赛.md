Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 29th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Second Steelmaking Plant is vigorously promoting a mass movement of "more loading, faster smelting," and steel production is rising steadily. The average daily output in the first twenty days of October has increased by more than 600 tons compared with September.

    The key to the Second Steelmaking Plant's increased steel production is mobilizing the masses to "load more, smelt faster, and maintain the furnace body well." Initially, some cadres believed that "the original open hearth furnace was designed to load 180 tons, and it takes 10 hours to smelt a furnace. More loading and faster smelting will inevitably cause problems." Some steelworkers were afraid that "more loading" would cause accidents. In response to these ideas, the leadership organized the masses to carry out a big airing of views, big debates. When debating whether more loading and faster smelting were possible, the majority of workers believed that as long as they worked hard and strengthened furnace maintenance, more loading and faster smelting could be achieved. Some workers cited the No. 18 open hearth furnace as an example, saying that this was an old furnace that had been loaded with 290 to 300 tons without any steel running or leaking accidents. The plant's leadership seized on the typical experience of maintaining the furnace body of the No. 18 open hearth furnace and widely publicized and promoted it to the masses, breaking down conservative ideas. This has expanded the loading capacity of all open hearth furnaces to more than 300 tons.

    After solving the "more loading" problem, "faster smelting" became the central link. In the past, when loading 260 tons, the fastest time to smelt a furnace of steel was six hours and twenty minutes. However, not long ago, the No. 16 open hearth furnace smelted a furnace of steel in five hours and forty minutes while increasing the loading capacity. Hou Yingwu, the steelworker who established this red flag, had only been a formal steelworker for less than four months. The plant's leadership immediately summarized and promoted the rapid steelmaking experience of this open hearth furnace, advocating learning Hou Yingwu's communist style, and organizing steelworkers to discuss and further break down conservative ideas. Then, Dai Bingxin, an assistant from the B shift of the No. 11 open hearth furnace, and all the workers worked hard together and smelted a furnace of steel in only five hours and ten minutes, creating the highest record for rapid steelmaking in a large open hearth furnace in the country.

    Without a vigorous competition, there would be no lasting and regular mass movement. The rapid steelmaking relay race in the Second Steelmaking Plant was first initiated by the No. 10 and No. 18 furnaces. In this competition, not only did all the steelworkers of the two furnaces participate, but also all personnel related to steelmaking were involved. In the first ten days, the No. 18 furnace first won by a score of three to zero. However, the No. 10 furnace then won by a score of three to zero in five days, surpassing the No. 18 furnace.

    This competition attracted and encouraged all the workers in the plant. The plant's leadership promptly summarized and promoted their experience, and according to the requirements of the masses, organized furnaces with the same conditions together, and pairs of furnaces launched a heated competition.

### 多装快炼多出钢  鞍钢第二炼钢厂展开高产竞赛

    多装快炼多出钢
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂展开高产竞赛
    据新华社鞍山29日电　鞍山钢铁公司第二炼钢厂大搞“多装、快炼”群众运动，钢产量步步上升，10月头二十天的平均日产量已比9月份提高了六百多吨。
    第二炼钢厂提高钢产量的关键，是发动群众“多装、快炼、维护好炉体”。开始，有的干部认为，“原平炉设计装入量是一百八十吨，一炉需炼十小时，再要多装快炼必然要发生问题”。有的炼钢工怕“多装”会出事故。领导方面针对这些思想，就组织群众大鸣大放大辩论。当辩论多装快炼是否可能时，绝大部分职工认为，只要苦干实干，加强炉体维护，多装快炼是能够做得到的。有的工人以十八号平炉为例，说这是个老炉子，已装入二百九十吨到三百吨，就没有发生跑钢漏钢事故。全厂各级领导抓住十八号平炉维护炉体的典型经验，向群众广泛地宣传推广，打破了保守思想。这样就使全部平炉装入量扩大到三百吨以上。
    解决了“多装”问题以后，“快炼”就成为中心的一环。过去装二百六十吨时，炼一炉钢最快是六小时二十分钟。可是不久，十六号平炉在扩大装入量的情况下，用五小时四十分钟炼出了一炉钢。树立这面红旗的炼钢工侯英武，正式当炼钢工还不到四个月。厂的领导方面立即总结和推广了这座平炉的快速炼钢经验，提倡学习侯英武的共产主义风格，组织炼钢工人座谈讨论，进一步打破保守思想。接着，十一号平炉乙班一助手戴秉信和全班工人共同苦干，仅用五小时十分钟炼了一炉钢，创造了全国大型平炉快速炼钢最高纪录。
    没有轰轰烈烈的竞赛就没有持久的经常性的群众运动。第二炼钢厂的快速炼钢三班接力赛，是由十号和十八号炉首先发起的。在这场竞赛中，不仅两个炉子的炼钢工人全部参加，与炼钢有关的人员也都卷进来了。第一个十天，十八号炉首先以三比零获胜。但是十号炉接着在五天内也以三比零获胜。赶过了十八号炉。
    这一竞赛吸引和鼓舞了全厂所有的职工。厂的领导方面及时总结和推广他们的经验，根据群众的要求，把条件相同的炉组织在一起，一对对炉子都展开了热火朝天的竞赛。
