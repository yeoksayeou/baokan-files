A person's revolutionary will, their communist ideology, their communist style, are the fundamental guarantees for their continuous progress. The miracles created in production by the disabled veterans of the Henan Disabled Veterans Sanatorium fully prove this point. Zhou Yunlong, a disabled veteran with lower limb disabilities, can make steel. Zhao Yongxiang, who is blind, can repair machines. Zhao Qiqing, who has no upper limbs, participates in field labor. He has no hands, so he uses his feet to thin seedlings, pull weeds, and turn sweet potato vines. Is there anything more moving in the world than this? In the past, during the years of war, these comrades galloped on the battlefield, fought bravely, and risked their lives. They used their blood to achieve revolutionary victory and protect the security of the motherland. Comrades like this, who have contributed to the country and the people, are fully entitled to enjoy the care given to them by the state and the people. However, these people who truly love socialism and communism, these heroes who truly love the motherland and the people, are not satisfied with their past contributions to the revolution, they want to make new contributions to the cause of socialist construction. They said, "As long as we have a breath of life, we will let this breath of life shine for the motherland." They said, "Our bodies are disabled, but our ambition and our spirit are not disabled." They sing: "Not afraid of being over sixty, even if the limbs are disabled, we will turn the old into young, turn the severely disabled into the lightly disabled, we will be heroes among heroes, we will be good men among good men." Look, what noble qualities, what noble communist style, what noble revolutionary optimism!

It is conceivable how difficult it is for a blind person, a severely disabled person who has lost both legs or hands, to engage in production and steelmaking. Not only is the technology brand new, requiring them to learn from scratch, but also the physiological adaptation requires an extremely strong will to overcome extremely arduous training. Disabled veteran Zhou Yunlong said it well: difficulties are dead, but people are alive. As long as people are willing to work and use their brains, they will definitely be able to overcome difficulties. Now, facts have proved that they have not only overcome difficulties, but also created wealth for the country, and realized their wish to "shine for the motherland as long as they have a breath of life."

Those who complain and shrink back when faced with difficulties, those who bow their heads to difficulties, please take a look at the deeds of these heroes! Think about how small and insignificant the difficulties you encounter are compared to their difficulties! Those who are frightened and fall down by difficulties should first examine themselves. The motherland is progressing rapidly, and the people's cause is flourishing. Even disabled people are leaping forward, but some people cannot keep up. Why is this? There is no other reason here, it is not that the difficulties are too great, but that the will is not strong enough, the proletarian communist red flag has not been planted in the mind, the style is not high, and therefore there is a lack of the spirit of forging ahead and striving for the upper reaches. Let us earnestly learn from these revolutionary disabled veterans! Learn their enthusiasm, learn their noble communist style, learn their revolutionary spirit of overcoming difficulties.

### 向河南残废军人学习

    向河南残废军人学习
    人们的革命意志，人们的共产主义思想，人们的共产主义风格，是人们不断前进的根本保证。河南残废军人教养院的残废军人在生产上创造的奇迹，完全证明了这一点。下肢残废的残废军人周云龙能炼钢，双目失明的赵永祥能修理机器，没有上肢的赵启清参加了田间劳动，他没有手，就用脚剔苗、拔草、翻红薯秧。世界上还有比这更感动人的事迹么？过去，在战争的年代里，这些同志曾经奔驰在战场上，奋不顾身，英勇战斗。他们用自己的鲜血取得了革命的胜利，保卫了祖国的安全。像这样对国家有功、对人民有功的同志，他们是完全有权利享受国家和人民给予他们的照顾的。但是，这些真正热爱社会主义和共产主义的人，这些真正热爱祖国和人民的英雄，并不以过去对革命的贡献为满足，他们要在社会主义建设事业中做出新的贡献。他们说：“我们只要有一口热气，就要让这口热气为祖国发一分光”。他们说：“我们的身体是残废了，但是，我们的志气，我们的精神并没有残废”。他们唱着：“不怕年过花甲，哪怕四肢残缺，要变老年为青年，变重残为轻残，要做英雄中的英雄，要做好汉中的好汉。”请看，这是何等高贵的品质，何等高贵的共产主义风格，何等高贵的革命乐观主义精神！
    一个双目失明的人，一个失掉双腿或双手的特等残废，去搞生产，炼钢铁，困难之大，困难之多，是可想而知的。不仅技术是全新的，需要从头学起，而且生理上的适应，也需要极坚强的意志来战胜极艰苦的磨炼。残废军人周云龙说得好，困难是死的，而人是活的，人只要肯干，肯动脑筋，就一定能克服困难。现在，事实证明，他们不仅战胜了困难，而且给国家创造了财富，实现了他们的“有一口热气，就要为祖国发光”的愿望。
    遇到困难就叫苦就畏缩不前，向困难低头的人，请看一看这些英雄们的事迹吧！想一想自己所遇到的困难与他们的困难比较起来，该有多么渺小，多么不足挂齿啊！被困难一吓就倒的人，应当首先检查一下自己。祖国正在一日千里，人民事业正在飞黄腾达，连残废了的人都在跃进，而有些人却跟不上脚步，这是为什么？这里不是别的什么原因，不是困难太大，而是意志太不坚强，思想上没有插上无产阶级的共产主义的红旗，风格不高，因而缺乏鼓足干劲、力争上游的勇往直前精神。让我们认真地向这些革命残废军人学习吧！学习他们的干劲，学习他们的高尚的共产主义的风格，学习他们的战胜困难的革命精神。
