Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Tsinghua University, which has improved the quality of teaching and scientific research in production practice, has begun to fully implement the half-work half-study system this semester.

The school's approach to implementing the half-work half-study system is based on organizing students to participate in productive labor, arranging students' study, production, and scientific research. Without weakening basic courses, the time students spend participating in productive labor accounts for more than one-third of the entire semester. The academic year is divided into three semesters, and each department applies it flexibly according to the characteristics of the major. Students in departments such as hydraulic engineering and civil engineering generally concentrate on labor for one semester and conduct theoretical teaching for two semesters; students in the mechanical manufacturing department labor one day and study one day; students in the radio and electronics department labor two days a week and attend classes four days; and students in the engineering physics department labor half a day and attend classes half a day. In most majors and departments, the time for productive labor and theoretical teaching is not completely separated. Departments such as hydraulic engineering also conduct some theoretical studies during concentrated labor, and also conduct some labor when concentrating on studying theory.

After the implementation of the half-work half-study system, in addition to the basic theory courses not being weakened, each department and each grade has a political class every week. These political classes will be conducted using methods of "blooming and contending, and great debates" based on the principles of linking with reality and improving thought. In addition, each department plans to concentrate on rectification for two weeks each academic year.

In terms of teaching methods, it is now very common for various departments to hold classes in workshops and construction sites. In addition to the school's teachers, workers, cadres working at the grassroots level, or teachers and students teaching and learning from each other participate in lecturing.

The school's half-work half-study system has developed on the basis of achieving great success in implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. Since this spring, the school has launched three production upsurges in implementing the Party's education policy and practicing diligence and frugality in running the school. The laboratories of various departments have become factories or workshops, and school-run factories have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The school has established sixty-one factories, workshops, engineering companies, and design companies. Participating in production activities has strictly tested the past teaching. An electrical expert was unable to solve the problem of manufacturing a small 1.7-kilowatt motor; a teacher in the foundry teaching and research group spoke eloquently about raising the temperature of molten iron, but when the temperature of molten iron could not be raised in production, his "rules" did not work. These problems were finally solved by experienced technicians. The more extensive the participation in productive labor, the more such cases increased. This forced a thorough reform of teaching, and a new upsurge of educational revolution was launched throughout the school.

In the teaching reform, the vast number of teachers and students pooled their wisdom and efforts to revise teaching plans, teaching outlines, and create new teaching materials, summarizing the rich experience in production. Nearly a hundred kinds of teaching and technical books have been collectively written. Third-year students majoring in water supply and drainage in the civil engineering department summarized the technical innovation experience gained in productive labor, and they also opened several courses themselves. Because the teaching content is closely linked to reality, and the mass line of the three-way combination of teachers, production experts, and students under the leadership of the Party Committee is implemented, the quality of school teaching has been significantly improved.

Combining productive labor, the school has also launched a high tide of scientific research. In the past six months, the school has conducted more than 1,000 research projects with a relatively high scientific level. The teachers and students of the mechanical manufacturing department have continuously completed thirteen projects in the research of ductile iron, and some projects have reached the world's advanced level. Last semester, the graduating students abandoned the past graduation design methods of "imaginary topics" and "armchair strategizing," and undertook more than 260 national design and engineering projects. As a result, to the surprise of many teachers, they successfully completed the tasks of on-site engineers. With the help of a few teachers, students in the hydraulic engineering department completed eight hydraulic engineering design tasks in four months that would have originally taken two or three years to complete. Among them, 228 projects were identified as excellent designs by relevant parties.

The remarkable achievements of more than six months have powerfully hit the doubting and opposing factions of the Party's education policy among teachers, and encouraged the vast majority of teachers and students to resolutely follow the path of diligence and frugality in running the school, and further demanded the implementation of the half-work half-study system.

    结合生产劳动  提高教学水平
    清华大学全面推行半工半读制
    新华社19日讯　在生产实践中提高了教学和科学研究质量的清华大学，本学期已开始全面推行半工半读制。
    这个学校实行半工半读的办法，是以组织学生参加生产劳动作为基础，安排学生的学习、生产和科学研究。在不削弱基础课程的前提下，学生参加生产劳动的时间在整个学期中占三分之一以上。全学年分成三个学期，各系按照专业的特点，加以灵活运用。水利工程、土木工程等系的学生大体上一个学期集中劳动，两个学期进行理论教学；机械制造系的学生则是一天劳动一天学习；无线电电子学系每周两天劳动，四天上课；工程物理系半天劳动半天上课。在多数专业和系里，生产劳动和理论教学的时间都不是截然分开的，水利等系在集中劳动时，也进行一些理论学习，在集中学习理论时也进行一些劳动。
    实行半工半读后，除基础理论课不削弱外，各系每个年级每周都有政治课，这些政治课将根据联系实际、提高思想的原则，用大鸣大放大辩论的方法来进行。除此，各系每学年还打算集中两星期时间进行整风。
    在教学方法上，现在各系在车间、工地现场上课的情形已很普遍，参加讲课的人，除了学校的教师外，还有工人、做基层工作的干部，或者由教师和学生互教互学。
    这个学校的半工半读是在贯彻党的教育和生产劳动相结合的方针取得巨大成绩的基础上发展起来的。今春以来，学校在贯彻党的教育方针实行勤工俭学中，掀起了三次生产高潮。各系实验室都变成工厂或车间，学校自办工厂像雨后春笋一般蓬勃地发展起来。全校建立了六十一个工厂、车间、工程公司和设计公司。参加生产的活动，严格检验了过去的教学，一位电机专家，对于制造一台一点七瓩的小型电动机中的问题竟不能解决；一位铸工教研组的教师对于提高铁水温度尽管讲得头头是道，但生产中铁水温度提不高的时候，他的“条条”却不灵了，这些问题，最后还是老技工解决了。参加生产劳动越广泛，这类事例也随着日益增多。这就迫使教学必须进行彻底的改革，于是在全校掀起了一个教育革命新高潮。
    在教学改革中，广大师生群策群力，重新修订教学计划、教学大纲和创作新的教材，把生产中的丰富经验总结起来，先后集体写出了近百种教学、技术用书。土木工程系给水排水专业三年级学生，总结了在生产劳动中获得的技术革新经验，自己还开了几门课程。由于教学内容密切联系实际，并且贯彻了在党委领导下，教师、生产能手、学生三结合的群众路线，学校教学质量显著提高。
    结合生产劳动，学校还掀起了科学研究的高潮。半年来，全校进行了一千多个具有相当高的科学水平的研究项目。机械制造系师生对球墨铸铁的研究连续完成了十三个项目，有些项目已达到了世界先进水平。上学期，应届毕业生抛开了过去“假想题目”“纸上谈兵”的毕业设计方法，担负起国家二百六十多项设计和工程，结果出乎许多教师的意外，出色地完成了现场工程师的任务。水利工程系学生在少数教师帮助下，四个月完成了原来须两三年才能完成的八项水利工程设计任务。其中，有二百二十八个项目被有关方面鉴定为优秀设计。
    半年多的显著成绩，有力地打击了教师中对党的教育方针的怀疑派和反对派，鼓舞着绝大多数师生坚决地走勤工俭学的道路，并且进一步要求实行半工半读。
