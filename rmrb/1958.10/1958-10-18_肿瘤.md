    Tumors
    A tumor is an abnormally growing lump in the human body, and can grow in any part of the body. Those growing on the surface can be seen and touched, and are commonly called lumps. Generally, they can be divided into benign and malignant types. Benign tumors grow slowly and do not invade adjacent tissues and organs. If they are not located in major organs, they generally do not endanger life. Malignant tumors include "cancers" and "sarcomas." They are composed of highly malignant cell clusters that can grow and multiply in any part of the body, taking nutrients and releasing toxins. Because they grow rapidly, they quickly invade adjacent tissues and organs, and can detach from their original location and metastasize to all parts of the body through blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. If not discovered and treated early, they can endanger life. However, neither benign nor malignant tumors are incurable diseases, so do not be intimidated by them.
    The causes of malignant tumors have not yet been fully understood in the world. Therefore, there are few treatment methods for malignant tumors in the world today. Generally, only X-rays, radium rays, and surgical removal are used for treatment, but these methods cannot completely solve the problem. In capitalist countries, the number of malignant tumor patients increases year by year, and they cannot receive treatment and can only wait for death. However, in our country, under the care of the Party, the health of the people is fully guaranteed. Recently, a widespread campaign of screening, prevention, and treatment of tumor diseases has been launched. Patients discovered early in the screening process will soon recover their health with the careful treatment and care of medical personnel.
    Traditional Chinese medicine, with its valuable and rich experience of thousands of years, has a wealth of experience in the treatment of malignant tumors. Since the Party proposed promoting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Chinese medicine has shown great promise in the treatment of malignant tumors. Many tumor diseases, such as esophageal cancer, cervical cancer, and other malignant tumors, have been treated. In our country, the conquest and elimination of malignant tumors is not far off.

    肿瘤
    肿瘤是在人体内不正常生长的肿块，可以生长在人体的各部；生长在表面的，看得见，摸得着，俗称瘤子。一般又可分为良性与恶性的两种，所谓良性的，生长得慢，不侵犯邻近的组织和器官，假如不是长在人体主要器官的，一般不会危及生命。恶性的肿瘤，又包括“癌”和“肉癌”两种。它由一团恶性程度很高的细胞群组成。它能够在人体的任何部分生长、繁殖，一面夺取养料，一面放出毒素。由于它生长得快，迅速的侵犯了邻近的组织和器官，并可以在原生长的地方脱落下来，通过血管或淋巴管转移到全身各部，如不及早发现和加以治疗，便会危及生命。但无论良性肿瘤或恶性肿瘤绝不是不能预防与治疗的病，不要被它吓倒。
    恶性肿瘤发生的原因，现在世界上还没有彻底弄清楚，因之，目前在世界上对恶性肿瘤治疗的办法还很少，一般只有X射线，镭射线及外科手术切除等的治疗，但这些方法并不能完全解决问题。在资本主义国家中，一年比一年增加的恶性肿瘤病人得不到治疗，只好等死。而在我们国家里，在党的关怀下，人民的健康有了充分的保证。最近已广泛的展开了普查、预防与治疗肿瘤病的工作。在普查中被早期发现的患者，在医务人员细心的治疗照顾下，他们不久即将恢复健康。
    几千年来有着宝贵丰富经验的祖国医学，在治疗恶性肿瘤上有着许多丰富的经验，自从党提出发扬祖国医学遗产，中医中药在治疗恶性肿瘤上，已经大放异彩。有许多肿瘤病，如食道癌，子宫颈癌及其他恶性肿瘤已得到治疗。在我们国家，恶性肿瘤的制服与消灭已为期不远。
