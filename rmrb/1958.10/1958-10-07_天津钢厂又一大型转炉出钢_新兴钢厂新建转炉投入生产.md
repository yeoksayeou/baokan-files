Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 5th: The newly built No. 2 Steelmaking Plant of Tianjin Steel Plant has started production ahead of schedule. The No. 1 large converter in this plant was completed on the 28th and produced its first heat of steel, with good production conditions.

The construction of the new No. 2 Steelmaking Plant is carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project started in late June this year and was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of this year and put into production at the beginning of next year. However, deducting the time lost due to rain stoppages, the entire civil construction and construction installation work of the first phase of the project took only two months, at least ninety days ahead of the original completion date.

Now, the second phase of the new construction project has broken ground and is expected to be completed in October. By that time, this new steel plant will have a total of eight ten-ton converters, with an annual steel production of 800,000 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 5th: The newly built five-ton converter at Tianjin Emerging Steel Plant produced its first heat of steel on September 29th.

This plant has newly built two five-ton converters, and it took only twenty-five days from the start of construction to completion. It is estimated that in the last three months of this year, the two converters can produce more than 10,000 tons of steel for the country. (Attached picture)

    天津钢厂又一大型转炉出钢
    新兴钢厂新建转炉投入生产
    据新华社天津5日电　天津钢厂新建第二炼钢厂已经提前开始生产，这个厂的一号大型转炉在28日建成，炼出了第一炉钢，生产情况良好。
    新建的第二炼钢厂的工程分两期进行。第一期工程是在今年6月下旬开工的，原定在今年年底建成，明年年初投入生产。但是，扣除因雨停工等时间，第一期工程全部土木建筑和建筑安装工程的工期只用了两个月，比原定的完工日期至少提前了九十多天。
    现在，第二期新建工程已经破土动工，预计在10月间完工。到那时，这个新建的钢厂就共拥有十吨转炉八座，每年可产钢八十万吨。
    新华社天津5日电　天津新兴钢厂新建五吨转炉在9月29日出了第一炉钢。
    这个厂新建了两座五吨转炉，从开工到建成只用了二十五天。预计在今年的最后三个月，两座转炉可以为国家生产钢一万吨以上。（附图片）
