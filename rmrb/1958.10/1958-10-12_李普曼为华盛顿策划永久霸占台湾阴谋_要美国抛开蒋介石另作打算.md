Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th: Walter Lippmann, an influential American bourgeois political commentator, recently published an article in the "Washington Post," arguing that for its own interests and to permanently occupy China's Taiwan, the United States should abandon Chiang Kai-shek and his successors and make other plans. This bourgeois strategist bluntly wrote, "Unless there is a policy unrelated to Chiang Kai-shek that maintains some form of autonomy in Formosa (referring to Taiwan) after he is gone, then we have no tenable policy." He complained, "We are constrained by Chiang Kai-shek. The impact on our interests is to be decided by Chiang Kai-shek and his successors." Lippmann demanded that the United States not "put all its eggs in Chiang Kai-shek's basket." Because he worried that the Chinese people might resolve their own internal affairs through negotiations, leaving the American invaders empty-handed in the end. He wrote, "The most likely scenario for a long time has been that since we are gambling with Chiang Kai-shek, the result will be a secret arrangement that excludes us." He was also concerned that China's suspension of the bombardment of Quemoy "indeed means that a foundation has been laid and seeds sown for China's secret arrangements."

Lippmann admitted that China's decision to order a seven-day cessation of the bombardment of Quemoy was "a remarkable action." He pointed out that the Chinese people held the "military initiative" on the Quemoy issue, "They can start or stop the shelling like turning a faucet on and off." Lippmann wrote, "Because they stopped the shelling without waiting for a ceasefire, they have placed Chiang Kai-shek in a position where it is almost impossible for him to refuse to supply the garrison and civilians on Quemoy," but doing so also means "fully accepting the favor bestowed by Beijing."

Lippmann believed that China's above decision was "very dramatic." Militarily, it was intended to show the Taiwanese Chinese the overwhelming advantage China possesses in the coastal island region. Politically, it was to make the Taiwanese Chinese "believe that their future lies in (submitting to) the mainland, and not in continuing to be servants of the United States."

Lippmann pointed out that immediately following Eisenhower and Dulles' repeated statements "overturning the idea that Chiang Kai-shek would return to the mainland" and "destroying the ridiculous notion that he is the legitimate government of China," the Chinese people presented the Chiang Kai-shek clique with a choice between submitting to the mainland or continuing to be trapped on Taiwan. He criticized Eisenhower and Dulles' clamoring that the United States would use force to intervene in China's liberation of the coastal islands as an attempt to prove America's so-called "courage and determination" on "trivial and foolish" matters.

Lippmann finally said, "The Quemoy issue is a practical problem" that should be treated with "calm, composure, and common sense," not with the attitude of being "on the battlefield of a world-ending war." He said that Quemoy is strategically "insignificant"; it is "just a troublesome little thing."

    李普曼为华盛顿策划永久霸占台湾阴谋
    要美国抛开蒋介石另作打算
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国有影响的资产阶级政论家李普曼最近在“华盛顿邮报”上发表了一篇文章，主张美国为了自己的利益和永久霸占我国的台湾，应该抛开蒋介石和他的继任者而另作打算。这位资产阶级的谋士露骨地写道：“如果没有一项同蒋介石不发生关系，而在他离开后在福摩萨（指台湾）保持某种自治的政策，那么我们就没有站得住脚的政策”。他埋怨说：“我们受到蒋介石的牵制。对我们的利益会受到什么影响，要由蒋介石和他的继任者决定”。李普曼要求美国不要“把全部赌注押在蒋介石身上”。因为他耽心，中国人可能通过谈判自己解决自己的内部事务而使美国侵略者到头来落得一场空。他写道：很久以来最可能出现的情况是：既然我们是在同蒋介石一起赌博，结果将会产生一种把我们排斥在外的秘密安排”。他并且耽心地认为，中国暂停炮击金门“的确意味着已经为中国的秘密安排奠定了基础和撒下了种子”。
    李普曼承认中国关于下令停止炮轰金门七天的决定是“一个引人注目的行动”。他指出，中国人民在金门问题上掌握着“军事上的主动权”、“他们可以像拧开、关上水龙头一样进行或停止炮击。”李普曼写道：“由于他们没有等待停火就停止了炮击，他们已经使蒋介石处于这样一种地位：他几乎不可能拒绝向金门的守军和平民供应补给品”，但是这样做又意味着“完全接受北京所赐予的恩惠”。
    李普曼认为，中国的上述决定是“非常富于戏剧性的”。它在军事上是要向台湾的中国人显示中国在沿海岛屿地区所占的压倒优势。另外在政治上则是要使台湾的中国人“相信他们的前途在于（归顺）大陆，而不在于继续当美国的仆从”。
    李普曼指出，紧接着艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯一再在讲话中“推翻了认为蒋介石会返回大陆的想法”和“摧毁了认为他真正是中国合法政府这一无稽之谈”之后中国人民向蒋介石集团提出了要他们在归顺大陆还是继续困守台湾二者之间进行选择。他批评艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯关于美国要用武力干涉中国解放沿海岛屿的叫嚣是企图在“微不足道和愚蠢”的事情上证明美国有所谓“勇气和决心”。
    李普曼最后说，“金门问题是一个实际问题”，应当用“冷静、镇定和具有常识的态度”而不应当用“处在世界末日的大战战场上”的态度来对待这个问题。他说，金门在战略上是“微不足道”的；它“只是令人感到麻烦的小东西”。
