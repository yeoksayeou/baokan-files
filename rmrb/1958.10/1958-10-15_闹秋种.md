Rushing Autumn Planting
        (Wu Geng Diao - Five Watches Tune)
    In the first watch, the moon rises, the deep plowing is in full swing, thinking of 30,000 catties of wheat, my whole body is as strong as Qin Ying.

    In the second watch, the moon is in the southeast, sending fertilizer is a joyous task, the soil ridges and deep ditches are arranged row by row, and the heaps of smoked fertilizer are like mountain embankments.

    In the third watch, the moon is directly overhead, leveling the land is even more extraordinary, each piece is leveled like a mirror, watering here reaches over there.

    In the fourth watch, the moon is in the west, repairing the ridges is even more active, ensuring quality, quantity, and specifications, going all out to create miracles.

    In the fifth watch, the east is bright, diverting water for irrigation is heroic, preparing fine seeds for close planting, ensuring next year we will launch satellites.

    闹秋种
        （五更调）
    一更里来月儿升，深翻土地闹的凶，想起小麦三万斤，浑身力气赛秦英。
    二更里来月东南，熏肥送粪搞的欢，土埨深沟行行排，烟熏肥堆如山岸。
    三更里来月正南，平整土地更非凡，块块整的平如镜，这边浇水到那边。
    四更里来月儿西，修整畦田更积极，保质保量保规格，鼓足干劲创奇迹。
    五更里来东方明，引水灌溉称英雄，准备良种来密植，保证明年放卫星。
