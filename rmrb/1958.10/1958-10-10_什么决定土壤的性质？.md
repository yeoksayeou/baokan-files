    What Determines the Properties of Soil?
    Gao Shiqi
    There are many types of soil, with various names, such as Chernozem, Chestnut soil, Red soil, Yellow soil, and other strange terms. These differently named soils have different properties, some very fertile, others very barren.
    Five factors determine the properties of soil: parent material, climate, topography, organisms, and soil age.
    First, let's talk about parent material.
    Parent material is also called subsoil; they are the parents of the soil and the children of the rocks. Soil is derived from parent material, and parent material is derived from rocks.
    There are many types of rocks on Earth, including white quartzite, gray limestone, speckled granite, and layered mica schist. These different rocks are composed of different minerals. Different minerals have different properties; some are easily decomposed and dissolved, others are more difficult, and their chemical compositions are also different.
    Since parent materials are the children of rocks, their chemical composition is influenced by the rocks and, in turn, affects the quality of the soil. For example, the more carbonates the parent material contains, the more fertile the soil will be; conversely, if carbonates are lacking, the soil becomes barren.
    Parent material—the parents of the soil—their density, porosity, and thermal conductivity also affect the properties of the soil. If the parent material is loose, porous, and easily conducts heat, then the soil will have sufficient air and moisture, ensuring its fertility.
    Next, let's talk about climate.
    Different regions have different climates. Wind, humidity, evaporation, temperature, and rainfall are all elements of climate, and they all affect the properties of the soil. The effects of temperature and rainfall are particularly significant. The higher the temperature, the faster the physical, chemical, and biological changes in the soil proceed; the lower the temperature, the slower they proceed. The more rainfall, the stronger the leaching effect in the soil, and many inorganic salts and humus will be carried away. The less rainfall, the drier the soil becomes, and the leaching effect is weakened.
    Third, let's talk about topography.
    Different topographies also have a significant impact on the properties of the soil. This is because the relationship between climate and topography is very close; often, the climate on the front and back of a mountain, or on the top and bottom of a mountain, is different. Generally speaking, the higher the terrain, the colder the climate; the lower the terrain, the hotter the climate; shady places are cold, and sunny places are hot. If it is a slope, the soil easily slides down, and the soil layer is not thick; if it is a depression, the soil particles easily accumulate, and the soil layer becomes thick. The higher the terrain, the deeper the groundwater; the lower the terrain, the closer the groundwater is to the surface.
    Therefore, due to different topographies, the properties of the soil are affected, so that plants grow well in some places and not so well in others.
    Fourth, let's talk about organisms.
    The biological world has a great impact on the soil, and their ranks include plants, animals, and microorganisms.
    Plants are accumulators of soil nutrients; their remains left in the soil can increase the organic matter and humus content of the soil to meet the needs of microbial activity. Plant roots also secrete acidic compounds, which can decompose minerals in the soil that are difficult to decompose.
    Due to plant coverage, the climate can be changed, which will cause the properties of the soil to change. For example, forests can moderate wind force, accumulate rainwater and snow, moisten the air, and reduce soil evaporation.
    Animals such as earthworms, ants, and larvae of various insects are also builders of the soil; they move around in the soil, and their activities loosen the soil particles.
    Microorganisms have an even greater impact on the properties of the soil. Representatives of microorganisms include protozoa, algae, fungi, actinomycetes, and bacteria. They destroy complex organic matter and build simple inorganic salts, promoting changes in the soil so that plants can get more nutrients. Among these, bacteria are the most active; they are not only nitrogen fixers in the air, but they also often cooperate with leguminous plants to fix more nitrogen, making the soil fertile. Even their dead remains become plant nutrients.
    Finally, let's talk about soil age.
    Soils have different ages. From its formation to the present, the soil has been changing and developing. It changes from one type of soil to another, so the age of the soil is related to its properties. The older the soil, the more complex its content.
    The above five factors all affect the properties of the soil. However, they can all be controlled by humans. The purpose of mankind's march towards nature is to change the properties of the soil, to use human labor to control the direction of soil development, so that it can better serve agricultural production.

### 什么决定土壤的性质？

    什么决定土壤的性质？
    高士其
    土壤的种类繁多，名称不一，有什么黑钙土、栗钙土、红壤、黄壤之类奇异的名词。这些不同名称的土壤，各有不同的性质，有的非常肥沃；有的十分贫瘠。
    决定土壤的性质有五种因素，这些就是：母质、气候、地形、生物和土壤年龄。
    先谈谈母质。
    母质又叫做生土，它们是土壤的父母，岩石的儿女。土壤都是由母质变来的，母质又都是从岩石变来的。
    地球上岩石的种类也很多，有白色的石英岩；有灰色的石灰岩；有斑斑点点的花岗岩；有一片一片的云母岩等等。这些不同的岩石，是由不同的矿物组成的。不同的矿物具有不同的性质，有的容易分解和溶解；有的比较难，它们的化学成分也不相同。
    母质既然是岩石的儿女，它们的化学成分既受岩石的影响，又转过来影响土壤质量的好坏。例如：母质所含的碳酸盐越多，土壤也就越肥沃，相反，如果碳酸盐缺少，土壤就变得贫瘠。
    母质——土壤的父母，它们的密度多孔性和导热性也影响土壤的性质。如果母质是疏松多孔又容易导热，就能使土壤里有充分的空气和水分，那末土壤的肥沃性就有了保证。
    其次谈气候。
    不同的地区，有不同的气候。风、湿度、蒸发的作用、温度和雨量，都是气候的要素，它们都会影响土壤的性质。其中以温度和雨量的作用更为显著。温度越高，土壤里的物理化学和生物学的变化就进行得越快；温度越低就进行得越慢。雨量越多，土壤里淋洗的作用就越强，很多的无机盐和腐植质就会被带走。雨量越少，土壤就会变得越干燥，淋洗作用也减弱。
    第三谈地形。
    地形的不同，对于土壤的性质也有很大影响。这是由于气候和地形的关系很密切，往往由于一山之隔，山前山后，山上山下的气候都不相同。一般说来，地势越高，气候越冷，地势越低，气候越热；背阴的地方冷，向阳的地方热。如果是斜坡，土壤容易滑下来，土层就不厚；如果是洼地，土粒就很容易集聚起来，土层就堆得厚。地势越高，地下水越深；地势越低，地下水离地面越近。
    所以，由于地形的不同，影响了土壤的性质，使有些地方植物生长得很好，有些地方植物就生长得不好。
    第四谈生物。
    生物界对于土壤的影响是很大的，它们的行列中有植物、动物和微生物。
    植物是土壤养料的蓄积者，它们的遗体留在土中，可以增加土壤有机质和腐植质的成分，以供微生物活动的需要。植物的根还会分泌带有酸性的化合物，可以使土壤中难于分解的矿物质得到分解。
    由于植物的复盖，可以改变气候，就会使土壤的性质发生变化。例如：森林能缓和风力、积蓄雨水和雪水、湿润空气、减少土壤的蒸发。
    动物中如蚯蚓、蚂蚁和各种昆虫的幼虫，也都是土壤的建设者，它们在土壤里窜来窜去，经过它们的活动，就会使土粒松懈。
    微生物对于土壤的性质影响更大。微生物的代表有原虫、藻类、真菌、放线菌和细菌，它们一面破坏复杂的有机物，一面建设简单的无机盐，促进了土壤的变化，使植物能得到更多的养料。这之间，以细菌最为活跃，细菌不但是空气中氮素的固定者，它们还经常和豆科植物合作，把更多的氮素固定起来，使土壤肥沃，就是它们死后的残体也变成了植物的养料。
    最后谈土壤年龄。
    土壤的年龄有大有小。土壤从它的发生到现在，一直都在变化和发展。它由一种土壤变成另一种不同的土壤，因而土壤的年龄和它的性质是有关系的。土壤越老，它的内容越复杂。
    以上五种因素，对于土壤的性质都有影响。但是，它们都可以由人类来控制。人类向大自然进军的目的，就是要改变土壤的性质，用人的劳动来控制土壤发展的方向，使它能更好的为农业生产服务。
