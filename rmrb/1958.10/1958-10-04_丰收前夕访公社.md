Visiting the People's Commune on the Eve of the Harvest
Chen Ge

On the eve of the bumper harvest, we arrived at the Caohe People's Commune. As soon as we arrived in Caohe, we were stunned by the thousands of people building roads. So many people, so many carts, working cheerfully in the rain. The girls of the "Rocket Company" in green shirts, took off their shoes, rolled up their trouser legs, faces full of sweat, bodies full of water, legs covered in mud, but the way they ran, the way they laughed, it was truly inspiring to see.

This commune includes four townships, forty agricultural cooperatives, fifty-two villages, forty-six thousand people, and one hundred and thirty thousand mu of land. It is full of earth-shattering people and events, and overflowing with the joy of harvest everywhere.

In Liangjiaying, we saw all the high-yield fields there: the biogas yams expected to yield one million jin per mu, the thousand-jin cabbages, and the dog-meat-soup-irrigated yams expected to yield one million jin per mu, all had already grown, and they were all growing very well. At the county party committee's experimental field, an artificial rain tower was being built. This side is all high-yield fields, waiting for the harvest. Cabbages weighing five hundred jin each have already grown very large; the "satellite" fields for next year's wheat have already been dug seven feet deep; the "biogas yams" in the tomb mounds where crops haven't grown for three hundred years have already been spread out in piles. Two hundred and fifty carts of horse manure, wheat straw, and water are mixed into piles, with wooden frames built on top, topped with two feet of soil, forming conical terraces, with yields expected to reach 1.2 million jin per mu. There are technical personnel specially managing it, measuring the ground temperature four times a day from midnight onwards, truly like a nurse taking care of a patient, a mother taking care of a baby. Our comrades couldn't help but praise:

　　Looking afar, pagodas layer upon layer,
　　Looking closer, biogas plants sweet potatoes,
　　Cabbage, a thousand jin per head,
　　Releasing a satellite to fly to the horizon.

But the determination and spirit of the commune members is even greater:

　　Bumper harvest in drought, bumper harvest in flood,
　　Bumper harvest whether dry or flooded,
　　Because we have the Party to lead,
　　We have no worries about reaching for the stars and grabbing the moon.

The spiritual outlook of the commune members has also been completely renewed. Take wage evaluation as an example: in Liangjiaying, none of the one hundred and fifteen households, six hundred and thirty-five people, argued for themselves. Li Desheng, who is over fifty years old at the pig farm, was evaluated by everyone at the branch meeting as a grade five worker, but he firmly insisted on only grade four. He said, "Grade four is enough, what do I need so much money for." The next day we went to the pig farm to visit him: "What grade were you evaluated at?" He said somewhat unhappily, "What grade or no grade, as long as I eat my fill and do my job well, that's enough."

As soon as we entered the Happiness Home, eighty-six-year-old Liu Laoxi said emotionally: "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would I be today. This place is really good, the food is good, the food is plentiful. At night, someone makes the bed, and in the morning, someone empties the chamber pot. It's truly better than having a real son. I never dreamed of such a good life like this." It's just like the saying:

　　Sugar is sweet, but honey is sweeter,
　　Cotton is warm, but fur is warmer,
　　The kindness of parents is great,
　　But it doesn't compare to Chairman Mao!

Speaking of the nursery and kindergarten in Liangjiaying, there's also an interesting story: When they were first established, the adults were still worried, running to see them several times a day, afraid that the children wouldn't eat well or be taken care of well. In fact, the children eat five tons of food every day, all refined grains, and there are special people to take care of and educate them. In less than two days, no one came to see them anymore. In less than a month after the kindergarten was established, no more children with snotty noses running around fighting could be seen in the village. They were all wearing new clothes made by the cooperative, polite to people, and able to sing many songs.

The happiest people in the commune are the women. Liang Qinghai's wife has four children. In the past, she got up early, cooked meals in the evening, went to the fields during the day, and had to grind flour and sew at night. Now that she has left the millstone, the kang, and the stove, life is much easier, and she can concentrate on production in the fields. Sixty-three-year-old Liang Zhangshi is alone. She said: "Now I'm extremely happy, and I don't have to work in the fields and worry about food and clothing anymore. When people are happy, they work harder. If someone pulls a row of weeds, I'll pull two rows." She has already received a piece of clothing and a towel awarded by the commune. When we were turning yam vines with a group of middle-aged women, they pulled us to sing. We sang "Socialism is Good," and they continued singing "Four Major Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention." Every day when they return from work in the fields, the children are clean and tidy, running to greet them singing songs. How can this scene not be inspiring?

Now, the Caohe People's Commune is leaping forward towards communism, planning to basically realize communism in 1963. At that time, industry will account for 70% of the commune's total output value, agriculture will be highly mechanized and electrified, roads will connect every village, and every camp will have cars. Within five to eight years, people under the age of forty will reach the level of a specialist or university. Now children and the elderly don't need money for food, clothing, housing, and entertainment, and in the future, everyone will not need money for food, clothing, housing, and entertainment. The people's living standards will reach: 2,500 jin of grain, 300 jin of meat, 70 jin of oil, 100 chi of cloth, 150 pounds of milk products, 800 eggs, 240 jin of sugar, and 147 jin of fruit per person per year. The main living materials can already "each according to his ability, each according to his needs." That can be considered an even greater bumper harvest than this year's bumper harvest.

    丰收前夕访公社
    辰戈
    大丰收前夕我们来到了漕河人民公社。一到漕河，就被成千修路的人惊呆了。多少人，多少马车，在雨里乐呵呵地一个劲儿干。穿绿汗衫的“火箭连”的姑娘，脱了鞋，卷起裤脚管，满脸的汗、满身的水、满腿的泥，但是，那个跑啊，那个笑啊，让人看了实在激动。
    这个公社包括四个乡、四十个农业社、五十二个村子、四万六千人、十三万亩土地，这里到处充满了惊天动地的人和事，到处洋溢着丰收的喜悦。
    我们在梁家营，把那里的丰产田都看过了：预计亩产百万斤的沼气山药，千斤一棵的大白菜，百万斤一亩的狗肉汤灌的山药，都已长出来了，而且都长得很好。在县委试验田里正修人工降雨塔。这边都是丰产田，在等待着丰收。五百斤一棵的大白菜已长得很大了；明年的小麦“卫星”田已开始挖下七尺深；在三百年没长过庄稼的坟冢堆里的“沼气山药”，已一堆堆地铺满了。把二百五十车马粪、麦秸、水搅成堆，上面搭木架，架上培土二尺，成锥形梯田，亩产将达一百二十万斤。这里有技术人员专门管理，从半夜三更起每天量四次地温，真像护士照顾病人、母亲照顾婴儿。我们同志不禁赞道：
    远望宝塔层层叠，
    近看沼气植地瓜，
    白菜一棵千斤重，
    放出卫星飞天涯。
    但是公社社员的决心和气魄更大：
    旱丰收来涝丰收，
    不旱不涝大丰收，
    因为有党来领导，
    摘星拿月也不愁。
    公社社员精神面貌也焕然一新。拿评工资来说吧，梁家营一百十五户，六百三十五人没一个人为自己争的，养猪场五十多岁的李得胜，在支部大会上，大家评他为五级工资，他坚决只要四级。他说“四级就足够了，要那么多钱干啥。”第二天我们去养猪场访问他：“你评了几级？”他不大高兴地说：“什么级不级的，饭吃饱、活干好，就行了。”
    一进幸福院，八十六岁的刘老希就感动地说：“要没共产党和毛主席领导，我哪有今天。这里真是好，吃的好，吃的饱。晚上睡觉有人叠被子，早晨起来有人倒便壶，真比有个亲儿强，我作梦也没梦见现在这样的好生活。”正是：
    糖甜不如蜜，
    棉暖不如皮，
    爹娘恩情重，
    赶不上毛主席！
    提起梁家营的托儿所和幼儿园，还有一段有趣的事：才成立时，大人还不放心，一天跑来看几次，怕孩子吃不好，照看不好。其实，孩子每天五吨饭，全部细粮，又有专人照管教养。没两天，再没一个人来看了。幼儿园成立不到一个月，村里已再看不到大鼻涕一甩到处打架的孩子，都穿着社里作的新衣服，见人有礼貌，会唱很多歌子。
    公社里最高兴的要算妇女了。梁青海妻子有四个孩子，过去早起、晚上作饭，白天下地，夜里还要推碾子，缝缝补补，现在离开了碾台、炕台、锅台，生活轻松多了，能安心下地生产了。六十三岁的梁张氏，孑身一人。她说：“现在心里愉快极了，再不用又下地又忙吃穿了。人一高兴，干活也起劲了。人家拔一垅草，我要拔两垅。”她已经得到公社奖给的一件衣服、一条毛巾。当我们跟一队中年妇女一起翻山药蔓时，她们就拉我们唱歌。我们唱了“社会主义好”，她们就接着唱“四大纪律十项注意”。每天她们由地里收工回来，孩子干干净净的，唱着歌儿跑来迎接。这情景，怎不令人心头激动呢？
    现在，漕河人民公社正向共产主义跃进，计划在1963年基本实现共产主义。那时，工业占公社总产值70％，农业高度机械化、电气化，村村公路沟通，营营有汽车。五至八年内，四十岁以下的人达到专科或大学水平。现在小孩、老人吃、穿、住、玩不要钱，将来每个人吃、穿、住、玩都不要钱。人民生活水平将达到：每人每年二千五百斤粮，三百斤肉，七十斤油，一百尺布，一百五十磅奶品，八百个蛋品，二百四十斤糖，一百四十七斤水果，主要生活资料已经可以“各尽所能，各取所需”。那可算是比今年的丰收更加伟大的丰收。
