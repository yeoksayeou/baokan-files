    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, October 20th: Lebanese National Front leader Salam, in a separate meeting with Xinhua reporters here today, said that from the very beginning, the Lebanese people considered the U.S. troops to be occupying Lebanon. He said that now the U.S. troops have no choice but to withdraw.
    Salam believes that the Lebanese people's uprising has achieved many successes. He pointed out that the first achievement was removing Chamoun, supported by imperialism, and his corrupt and tyrannical regime. He said that next, we made great progress in re-establishing a neutral policy and a policy of not allying with either the East or the West. He said that the Lebanese people also successfully defeated the conspiracy to create religious disputes.
    He believes that "the imperialists have recognized our strength, and they now have to change their policies."
    Salam believes that the current government is one that combines reconciliation and action. He estimates that "the cabinet members are very determined to restore order and law." He said, "In this regard, we are helping the cabinet, and we support the current government."
    Regarding the Lebanese government's foreign policy, Salam believes it should be "neutral, non-aligned, for the liberation of Arab Lebanon, and for full cooperation with Arab countries, especially with the United Arab Republic."
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 20th: Lebanese Foreign Minister Oueini told reporters from the Middle East News Agency in Beirut that Lebanon's foreign policy is to "befriend anyone who is willing to befriend us" and "not to participate in any foreign alliances or sign any military treaties."
    The Foreign Minister said: "We have nothing to do with the problems between the major powers. We abide by the National Pact signed in 1943, neither providing bases nor granting privileges to any country."
    Oueini said that Lebanon will eliminate all the adverse effects caused by the old regime on the relations between Lebanon and Arab countries. He said: "We will not allow our country to become the center of conspiracies against any Arab country."
    The Foreign Minister also said that Lebanon and the United Arab Republic have the most friendly and cooperative relations; Lebanon is considering withdrawing its complaint against the United Arab Republic in the Security Council.

    黎民族阵线领袖萨拉姆说
    美军撤退事非得已
    黎外长说不向任何国家提供基地
    新华社贝鲁特20日电　黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖萨拉姆今天在这里单独接见新华社记者时说，从一开始，黎巴嫩人民就认为美国军队是在占领黎巴嫩。他说，现在美国军队不得不撤退。
    萨拉姆认为黎巴嫩的人民起义取得了很多的成就。他指出，第一个成就是除掉了帝国主义支持的夏蒙和他的腐败暴虐的政权。他说，接着，我们在重新建立中立政策和不同东西方结盟的政策这方面，取得了很大的成绩。他说，黎巴嫩人民还成功地击败了制造宗教纠纷的阴谋。
    他认为，“帝国主义者已经认识到我们的力量，他们现在不得不改变他们的政策。”
    萨拉姆认为，现在的政府是一个和解和行动同时并举的政府。据他估计，“内阁阁员们有很大的决心来恢复秩序和法律”。他说，“在这方面我们帮助内阁，我们支持现政府”。
    关于黎巴嫩政府的外交政策，萨拉姆认为，它应当是“中立，不参加联盟，阿拉伯黎巴嫩的解放，同阿拉伯国家尤其是同阿拉伯联合共和国进行全面合作”。
    新华社开罗20日电　黎巴嫩外交部长乌埃尼在贝鲁特对中东通讯社记者说，黎巴嫩的外交政策是“同愿意和我们做朋友的任何人做朋友”以及“不参加任何外国联盟，也不签订任何军事条约”。
    这位外交部长说：“我们同大国之间发生的问题毫无关系。我们恪守1943年签订的国民公约，既不向任何国家提供基地，也不给予特权”。
    乌埃尼说，黎巴嫩将消除旧政权在黎巴嫩和阿拉伯国家的关系中所造成的一切不良影响。他说：“我们不允许把我们的国家变成反对任何阿拉伯国家的阴谋的中心。”
    这位外交部长又说，黎巴嫩和阿拉伯联合共和国之间有着最友好的、合作的关系；黎巴嫩正在考虑撤回它在安全理事会内对阿拉伯联合共和国提出的控诉。
