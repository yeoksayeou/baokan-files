Editor's Notes

    Useless Threat
    De Gaulle once said that if any French overseas territory rejected his draft "constitution" in a "referendum," France would recognize its independence. But after Guinea rejected De Gaulle's "constitution" in the "referendum," the De Gaulle government has so far refused to recognize Guinea's independence.
    Clearly, De Gaulle's words before the "referendum" were intended to threaten the people of Guinea and other colonies. His current self-contradictory actions are also intended to threaten the people of Guinea. But today's threat, like yesterday's threat, will not have any effect.

    无用的威胁
    戴高乐曾经说过，那一个法国的海外领地在“公民投票”中拒绝了他的“宪法”草案，法国就承认它独立。但是当几内亚已经在“公民投票”中拒绝了戴高乐的“宪法”，戴高乐政府却至今不肯承认几内亚的独立。
    很显然，戴高乐在“公民投票”以前说的话目的是想威胁几内亚和其他殖民地的人民；今天自食其言的做法，也同样是想威胁几内亚人民。但是今天的威胁也同昨天的威胁一样，都是不会有什么作用的。
