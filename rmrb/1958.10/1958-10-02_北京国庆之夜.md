    Beijing's National Day Night
    Tonight, under the bright moon, fireworks bloomed in Tiananmen Square. Two hundred thousand people in Beijing gathered here to celebrate the ninth National Day and to make up for the Mid-Autumn Festival.
    Soon after the mass parade ended this afternoon, men, women, old and young, flocked to Tiananmen Square again. Many foreign friends also came here to celebrate with the people of Beijing. The square, with an area of 130,000 square meters, and the East and West Chang'an Streets, about 3,000 meters long, formed a joyful sea of people. The light of the fireworks adorned the sky above the square into a beautiful "garden," and hundreds of floodlights illuminated the faces of thousands filled with joy, with peace doves spreading their wings in the wind. The song "Socialism is Good" grew louder and stronger, and the strong waves of "We must liberate Taiwan" came from all directions. Workers from various factories in Beijing performed their own created living newspapers, clapper talks, and cross talks on the square. Here they were "singing and rapping about the Great Leap Forward," and there they were dancing the "Red Flag Dance."
    Industrial labor models from various regions visiting Beijing and visiting delegations from fraternal ethnic groups also joined the people of Beijing here tonight to celebrate the festival. They talked happily together, agreeing to make persistent efforts and meet here again next year today with greater production achievements. In the female worker dance troupe of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Mill, people saw more than a hundred "red flag bearers" in production. Many of them are both production experts and art enthusiasts. Workers from Beijing No. 3 Cotton Mill performed the living newspaper "Down with the American Wolves" here. In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes in the center of the square, more than 10,000 militiamen from various regions and officers and soldiers of the three services of the People's Liberation Army gathered. Many of them were once famous combat heroes, meritorious individuals, and guerrilla veterans who defeated the American invading army, the Japanese devils, and the Chiang bandit army. Some people were reunited here after a long separation, and they talked intimately. When someone talked about how the American devils and the Japanese devils became their defeated opponents, laughter broke out in the crowd. Yue Xingfu, a commander of a certain unit who had been commended twice for his merits in the Battle of Ma Liangshan during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, expressed his determination to defend the motherland to his comrades and the people around him in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes. He said passionately: "I guarantee to the motherland and the revolutionary martyrs that I will resolutely complete the unfinished business of the martyrs, and we must liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and we must liberate Taiwan!"
    The night grew deeper, and the streets and alleys of Beijing were still brightly lit, and the singing continued. At this time, night shift workers far away from Tiananmen Square were working beside machine tools, in front of blast furnaces, and in mines to complete the production tasks for the first day of the tenth year of the founding of the country. Workers at the Beijing Steel Plant celebrated this happy night in intense labor. The Wang Huaiqing Youth League team of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop produced more than five tons of steel for the country at 9:40 p.m. Many people's communes in the suburbs held lavish dinners for their members today. In the evening, many people enjoyed the moon while eating mooncakes and fruits provided free of charge by the commune, discussing how to devote themselves to more intense labor tomorrow and strive for a greater harvest to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

    北京国庆之夜
    今天晚间，皎月当空，天安门广场上礼花争艳。北京二十万人民在这里欢庆第九个国庆日和补过中秋佳节。
    今天白天的群众游行结束不久，男女老少就又涌向天安门广场。很多外国朋友也来到这里和北京人民同乐。面积有十三万平方公尺的广场和长约三千公尺的东、西长安街上，形成了欢乐的人海。礼花的光芒把广场上空点缀成美丽的“花园”，几百盏强光灯照射着千万幅喜气洋溢的面容，和平鸽迎风展翅。“社会主义好”的歌声越唱越强，“一定要解放台湾”的强烈声浪来自四面八方。北京各厂的职工在广场上表演着他们自己创作的活报剧、快板和相声，这里“说唱大跃进”，那里跳着“红旗舞”。
    来北京参观的各地工业劳动模范和各兄弟民族的参观团，今晚也在这里同北京人民一起欢度佳节。他们在一起欢叙，相约要再接再厉，明年今天带着更大的生产成就再在这里见面。在北京国棉二厂的女工舞群中人们看到了一百多个生产上的“红旗手”，她们当中有很多人既是生产能手，又是文艺爱好者。北京国棉三厂的职工们在这里表演了活报剧“打倒美国狼”。在广场中心的人民英雄纪念碑前，围聚着一万多名来自各地的民兵和人民解放军三军将士。他们当中很多人曾经是打垮了美国侵略军、日本鬼子和蒋贼军的著名战斗英雄、功臣和游击队的老手。有些人在这里久别重逢，他们亲热地交谈着，当有人讲到美国鬼子、日本鬼子怎样成了他们手下败将的情景时，人群中不断发出笑声。曾经在抗美援朝的马良山战役中立过两次功的某部指挥员岳兴福，在人民英雄纪念碑前对他的战友和他周围的人们表示了他保卫祖国的决心，他激愤地说：“我向祖国和革命先烈保证，坚决完成先烈们未竟的事业，一定要解放金门马祖，一定要解放台湾！”
    夜渐渐深了，北京的大街小巷，仍然灯火辉煌，歌声不绝。这时，远离天安门广场的夜班工人们在机床旁、高炉前、矿井里为完成建国第十个年头的第一天的生产任务而劳动着。北京钢厂的工人们在紧张的劳动中欢度着这个幸福的夜晚。第一炼钢车间共青团员王槐庆青工小组在九点四十分又为国家多生产五吨多钢。郊区的很多人民公社今天为社员们举行了丰盛的会餐，晚间许多人一面赏月一面吃着公社免费供给的月饼和水果，谈论着明天怎样投入更紧张的劳动中去，争取以更大的丰收来迎接国庆十周年。　（新华社）（附图片）
