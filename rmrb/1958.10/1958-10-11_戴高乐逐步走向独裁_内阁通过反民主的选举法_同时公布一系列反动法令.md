Xinhua News Agency, October 7th: Paris Dispatch: The French government, in its cabinet meeting on the 7th, passed a new anti-democratic "election law" aimed at cracking down on the French Communist Party and other progressive forces.

It is announced that according to the new "election law," the so-called "single-member constituency two-round majority system" will be adopted in the election of the first parliament of the so-called Fifth Republic. This electoral system is basically the same as the one adopted by France before the Second World War. At that time, some right-wing parties in France used this system to manipulate the French parliament for a long time.

According to the new "single-member constituency two-round majority system," each constituency will have approximately 93,000 people, and one member of parliament will be elected from each constituency. Each party can only nominate one candidate in each constituency during the election; whoever gets an absolute majority of votes in the first round of voting is elected. If no one gets an absolute majority in the first round, a second round of voting will be held. In the second round of voting, a simple majority is enough to be elected, and parties are allowed to form alliances.

This system will facilitate the collusion of various right-wing bourgeois parties to deal with the French Communist Party and other democrats in the second round of voting, thereby achieving the conspiracy of illegally excluding representatives of the working people from the National Assembly.

Officials also announced that the election of the new National Assembly will be held on November 23rd; constituencies that need to hold a second round of voting will vote again on the 30th of the same month. In addition, the election of the new president of the "Fifth Republic" will be held on December 14th. De Gaulle will participate in the presidential "election."

Minister of Propaganda Soustelle announced the above decision after the cabinet meeting. He also said that in the new National Assembly, the French mainland will only have 465 members, almost 80 fewer than the current number of mainland members. He did not announce the total number of seats because the number of members for overseas territories has not been finalized.

It is reported that there were great differences in the cabinet meeting when discussing the new election law. Supporters and opponents were deadlocked. It was only reluctantly passed after De Gaulle came forward to exert pressure.

Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: TASS Paris Dispatch: The "Government Gazette" of the 8th and 9th published a series of decrees issued by the French government to destroy and persecute democratic organizations. According to these decrees, anyone suspected of providing "direct or indirect material assistance" to Algerian patriots fighting for national independence can be monitored, exiled, or "administratively detained" according to the decision of the police bureau without trial or judgment. According to another decree, the authorities have the right to add charges such as "creating traffic obstacles on the road" and "organizing illegal gatherings" to anyone based on their own judgment, and then send them to military courts.

"Le Monde" published a statement issued by the Vigilance Committee of Republican Legal Workers, expressing its firm protest against this decree of "establishing a concentration camp system in France."

    戴高乐逐步走向独裁
    内阁通过反民主的选举法  同时公布一系列反动法令
    新华社7日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府已经在7日的内阁会议上通过了旨在打击法国共产党和其他进步力量的反民主的新“选举法”。
    据宣布，根据新“选举法”，在选举所谓第五共和国的第一届议会时将采用所谓“单人选区二轮多数制”。这种选举制基本上同第二次世界大战前法国所采用的那种选举制相同。当时法国一些右翼党派曾经利用这一制度长期操纵法国的议会。
    按照新的“单人选区二轮多数制”的规定，每一选区大致将有九万三千人口；每选区将选出一名议员。各党派在竞选时在每一选区只能提出一名候选人；谁在第一次投票中得到绝对多数票就当选。如果没有人在第一轮选举时得到绝对多数，就要举行第二轮投票。在第二轮投票时，只要简单多数就可以当选，而且允许各党派结成联盟。
    这种制度将便于各右翼资产阶级政党在第二轮投票时勾结起来对付法国共产党和其他民主人士，从而达到在国民议会中非法排斥劳动人民代表的阴谋。
    官方还宣布说，新国民议会的选举将在11月23日举行；有必要举行第二轮投票的选区将在同月30日再次举行投票。另外，“第五共和国”新总统的选举将在12月14日举行。戴高乐将参加总统“竞选”。
    宣传部长苏斯戴尔在内阁会议之后宣布了上述决定。他还说，在新国民议会中，法国本土将只有四百六十五名议员，比目前本土议员的数目几乎少八十名。他没有宣布席位总数，因为有关海外属地的议员名额还没有最后决定。
    有消息说，内阁会议上在讨论新选举法时出现了很大的分歧。赞成者和反对者双方相持不下。最后在戴高乐出面施压力之后才勉强通过。
    据新华社10日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：8日和9日的“政府公报”公布了法国政府为摧残和迫害民主组织而颁布的一系列法令。根据这些法令，凡是有对为争取民族独立而斗争的阿尔及利亚爱国者进行“直接或间接物质援助”嫌疑的人，可以在未经审讯和判决的情况下根据警察局的决定遭到监视、放逐或“行政拘禁”。根据另一法令，当局有权根据自己的判断，给任何人加上“在路上制造交通障碍”、“组织非法集会”等罪名，然后送交军事法庭。
    “世界报”发表了共和法律工作者警惕委员会为此发表的声明，表示坚决抗议这种“在法国建立集中营制度”的法令。
