    An Ordinary Soldier
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Wenpin

    One early autumn morning, a group of soldiers from a certain company were enthusiastically practicing individual combat drills. At the forefront of the shooting and charging were several older privates wearing new uniforms. These were General Yang Dezhi, Commander of the Jinan Military Region, Major General Li Yaowen, Director of the Political Department, and Major General Chen Meizao, Director of the Cadre Department, who had recently joined the company as ordinary soldiers. The nearly fifty-year-old general was tumbling and rolling alongside the young men, showing no signs of fatigue, which was truly admirable. Later, comrades who came down with the commander to serve as soldiers told reporters that he had made extensive preparations before joining the company.

    After Chairman Mao called on all levels of army cadres to serve as soldiers in companies for one month each year at the Beidaihe Conference, General Yang Dezhi was the first to respond. This general, who rose through the ranks, joined the Red Army in January 1928 and became a cadre in May 1929, had been separated from the life of a soldier for thirty years. This time, to return to the soldier's life of thirty years ago, he made many mental and physical preparations before joining the company. He gave up his midday nap habit a dozen days before joining the company and sunbathed in the scorching sun. Every morning and evening, he asked clerks to teach him drills according to the new regulations. A few days before joining the company, he received the soldier's uniform and put it on with joy. He looked in the mirror, practicing marching in formation and saluting. Before leaving, the commander gathered the cadres who were joining the company with him and held a meeting to discuss how to train themselves. To facilitate the squad leader's bold management, the commander said, "You can still call me by my old name, Yang Shaoqi."

    Yang Shaoqi and others arrived at the fourth squad of a certain company. He said to squad leader Yin Bihui, "I am a new recruit, and I am not familiar with many things. You must help me." To quickly settle down these new comrades-in-arms, the squad leader opened the drawer of Yang Shaoqi's bunk and taught him how to place his toothpaste and soap dish. After putting them in place, the squad leader asked, "Old Yang, where is your satchel?" Yang Shaoqi quickly took the satchel and handed it to the squad leader with both hands. The squad leader opened it and saw that it contained a razor, socks, and a notebook. The squad leader picked up the razor with curiosity and asked, "Why did you bring this?" Yang Shaoqi said, "I am old, and I have to shave twice a week. You young men don't need this." This made everyone laugh.

    Shortly after they arrived, they were met with the regimental organization's assessment of all-around marksmen. Although Yang Shaoqi had not touched a gun for many years, he was, after all, a man who had come out of a hail of bullets. During the live firing, he scored two excellent and one good, which was applauded by everyone.

    Comrade Yang Shaoqi showed the true colors of the People's Liberation Army everywhere during this return to the company, leading by example in everything and able to mingle with the masses. His exemplary actions were unanimously praised by the company leaders and comrades. Every morning, after returning from morning exercises, he rushed to wipe the windows and empty the spittoons. He paid close attention to maintaining the collective honor of his squad, always checking the scores of the squad's inspection of internal affairs every day. Once, he saw that the fourth squad's face towels were rated three points, and he came back to ask the squad leader, "Which towel in our squad is not good?" The squad leader said, "You don't have to worry about this!" He said, "How can I not worry? If it's mine that's not good, I'll correct it. If it's theirs that's not good, I'll urge them to do it well." Once, when gathering for breakfast, he ran out and saw that everyone else was wearing shirts, while he was wearing his military uniform. He was about to run back to take off his clothes, but the squad leader said, "It's cold, so don't take it off." He said, "Even if it's cold, I have to exercise." When the local opera troupe came to the barracks to perform, he bought a ticket for each of his squadmates. He was about to distribute the tickets to everyone when he hesitated and handed the tickets to the squad leader to distribute. He said that this was more organized and disciplined. Because he was able to mingle with the masses, the soldiers were willing to confide in him. Even the contents of the fourth squad leader's letters from his fiancée were shared with him.

    After a few days, some soldiers began to suspect that Comrade Yang Dezhi was too old and had been in the army for too long. He was definitely not an ordinary cadre, but a leader. Which leader was he? The newspaper had published news about Commander Yang coming down to serve as a soldier, but no one knew which company he had gone to. Some curious people went to the club to check the group photo of the Jinan Military Region Party Congress. Some thought the face looked very similar, but the build did not. Some said, "Yang Shaoqi's words and actions are all like ordinary soldiers. Could he be a leader?"

    After Commander Yang came down to the company as a soldier for a week, he became very familiar with the soldiers! He considered that telling the soldiers that he was the commander of the Jinan Military Region would not hinder the work, so he, along with Director Li and Minister Chen, met with the soldiers at a general assembly of the entire battalion. Many soldiers, upon hearing that the person they had been guessing about was indeed Commander Yang Dezhi, excitedly erupted in thunderous applause.

    In his speech, Commander Yang said, "This is the first time I have come down to the company as a soldier since I became a cadre. I was afraid that if the comrades heard that the commander was coming down to serve as a soldier, the squad leader would not dare to manage the general, so I didn't introduce myself to the comrades at the beginning." In his speech, Commander Yang repeatedly praised the company comrades' drive and the soldiers' excellent qualities of hard work, simplicity, purity, and loveliness, and expressed his determination to learn from the comrades.

    After the news of Commander Yang's service here became public, this heroic company became even more excited. The soldiers said that a general coming down to serve as a soldier is unprecedented at home and abroad, and it is also a new development of our army's glorious tradition. Encouraged by Commander Yang and others' soaring enthusiasm, the officers and soldiers launched an unprecedented training upsurge. That night, in the individual combat shooting with carbines, the entire company achieved excellent results. (Attached pictures)

    普通一兵
    本报记者　姜文品
    一个初秋的上午，某连的一伙战士正在精神百倍地预习单个战斗。射击冲击在最前面的是几位年龄较大身着新服装的列兵，这就是最近济南地区部队下到连队当兵的司令员杨得志上将、政治部主任李耀文少将、干部部长陈美藻少将。年近五十岁的上将和小伙子们一样的摸爬滚打，面上毫无倦色，实是令人敬佩。后来和司令员一块下来当兵的同志告诉记者说，原来他在下连之前是有多方准备的。
    从毛主席在北戴河会议号召军队各级干部每年下连当兵一个月后，杨得志上将最先响应了这一号召。这位当兵出身的将军，1928年1月参加红军，1929年5月当了干部，现在脱离士兵生活整整三十个年头。这次又要恢复三十年前的士兵生活，他在下连之前作了许多精神上体力上的准备。下连前十几天就取消了午睡习惯，在酷热的阳光下晒日光浴。每天早晚，他请公务员按新制式教练教他操练。下连的前几天领来战士服装，他高兴地穿戴起来。照着镜子，练习走齐步，敬礼。临走时，司令员召集起同他一块下连当兵的干部开会，研究怎样下去锻炼自己。为便于班长大胆管理，司令员说我还用过去叫过的名字杨绍起。
    杨绍起等来到某连四班，他向班长尹必辉说，我是个新兵，有许多东西不熟习，你要好好帮助我。为早点安置下这些新来的战友，班长拉开杨绍起床铺上的抽屉，教他怎样放牙膏肥皂盒。放好后，班长问：老杨同志你的挎包哩，杨绍起急忙取过挎包，双手递给班长。班长揭开一看：里面盛着刮脸刀、袜子、笔记本，班长稀罕地拿起刮脸刀问：你怎么还拿这个来？杨绍起说，年老啦，一周得刮两次胡子，你们年幼的用不着这个。逗得大伙笑了起来。
    他们来到不久，就赶上团组织考核全能枪手。杨绍起虽然多年没摸过枪了，但终究还是从枪林弹雨中打出来的人，临场射击时，获得了两个优秀，一个良好，全场无不喝采。
    杨绍起同志这次回到连队，处处表现了人民解放军的本色，逢事以身作则，能和群众打成一片。他的模范行动，获得连首长和同志们的一致好评。他每天早上收操回来，争先恐后地去擦玻璃，倒痰盂。他很注意维护本班的集体荣誉，每天总要去看看本班检查内务时评的分数。一次，他看到四班擦脸的毛巾评了三分，回来问班长：咱班是那条毛巾不好？班长说这个你不要管！他说：这那能不管，是我的不好就纠正，是他们的不好就督促他作好。一次，集合吃早饭，他跑出一看，别人都穿的衬衣，他上身穿的军服。就要跑回去脱衣服，班长说，天冷就不要脱了，他说冷也要锻炼锻炼。地方剧团来营房演戏，他给本班同志每人买了张戏票，刚想分给大家，手又缩回来了，他把票交给了班长向下分，他说这样更有组织纪律些。因他能和群众打成一片，战士们都愿跟他谈心。四班长连未婚妻来信的内容都跟他谈啦。
    过了几天，有的战士开始猜疑起来了，他们觉得杨得志同志这样大年纪，参军又这样久，绝不是一位普通干部，一定是一位首长。是那一位首长呢？报纸上登过杨司令员下连当兵的消息，可是都不知道到了那个连队。一些好奇的人，就跑到俱乐部，找济南地区部队党代表大会的合影查对，有的看出面孔很像，身材不像；有的说：“杨绍起的言谈话语一举一动，都和我们普通士兵一样，他会是个首长吗？”
    杨司令下连当兵一个星期以后，已和士兵们搞的怪熟啦！他考虑告诉战士们他是济南部队司令员，对工作已没有什么妨碍了，于是同李主任、陈部长等一起在全营军人大会上与战士们见了面。许多战士们一听自己平时所猜想的那个人正是杨得志司令员，兴奋地发出了雷鸣般的掌声。
    杨司令员在讲话中说，我从当了干部以后，这是第一次下连当兵。原来怕同志们听说是司令员下来当兵，班长不敢管理上将，开始就没有向同志们介绍。杨司令员在讲话中一再赞扬连队同志的干劲和战士们艰苦朴素、纯正可爱的优秀品质，表示一定要好好向同志们学习。
    杨司令员在这里当兵的消息公开以后，使这个功臣连队更加沸腾了。战士们说，将军下连当兵，这是古今中外没有的事情，也是我军光荣传统的新发展。官兵们在杨司令员等冲天干劲的鼓舞下，掀起了空前的练兵热潮。当晚打骑枪单个战斗射击，全连获得了优秀成绩。（附图片）
