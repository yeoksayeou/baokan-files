Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd, Taipei News: Chen Cheng, the "Vice President" of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, delivered another speech on the 21st, clamoring to pursue a "firm policy and actions of strength," to continue the civil war, and to "strive for the final victory against communism and Russia." Chen Cheng vilified the resumption of punitive artillery shelling against the Chiang army. He also admitted that the Chinese people are currently "in an advantageous position to either fight or stop."

In his speech, Chen Cheng also criticized the United States' "escapism and phased surrenderism" by innuendo. He said that "some naive American public opinion wants [the Chiang Kai-shek Group] to reduce or withdraw troops stationed in Kinmen and Matsu," wanting the United States to "retreat from the edge of victory." He accused that this is "invisibly helping the enemy to attack America's loyal allies, which is a very cruel act." He also said, "In fact, escapists are already advocating a very dangerous theory, that is, believing that the United States only needs enough nuclear bombs and missiles, and even if only the U.S. mainland is left, it can still fight a war with the communist bloc. This is really strange. Why do they have to create a nuclear war to solve the problem, and how can they guarantee that the United States will win a nuclear war in the future?"

The "United Daily News," which is close to the Taiwan authorities, also published an editorial on the same day (21st) that Dulles arrived in Taipei, demanding that Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek "reach a tough and resolute agreement" in their talks in Taipei. The editorial said, "This agreement should include the following three points": First, guarantee that the US and Chiang Kai-shek Group "will always be anti-communist allies, and the United States will never retreat from the Taiwan Strait"; second, "clearly state" that the Chiang Kai-shek Group "has the right to defend Kinmen and Matsu," and the United States "has the obligation to assist [the Chiang Kai-shek Group] in the war to defend the outer islands"; third, the United States "decides to immediately stop" the Warsaw talks.

    陈诚狂叫反共嗔骂美国
    新华社22日讯　台北消息：蒋介石集团“副总统”陈诚21日又发表演说，叫嚣要奉行“坚定的政策与实力的行动”，把内战打下去，“为争取反共抗俄的最后胜利而努力”。陈诚对恢复对蒋军的惩罚性炮击，进行了诬蔑。他同时承认，中国人民目前“居于可打可停的有利地位”。
    陈诚在演说里还指桑骂槐地猛烈抨击美国的“摆脱主义与分期投降主义”。他说，“美国一部分天真的舆论要（蒋介石集团）减少或撤退金马驻军”，要美国“从胜利边缘退下来”。他指责说，这是“无形中帮助敌人来打击美国的忠实盟友，这实在是一种非常残忍的行为”。他又说，“实际上摆脱主义者已在鼓吹一种非常危险的理论，此即以为美国只要有了足够的核弹、导弹，即使剩下美国本土仍可与共产集团打一仗，这实在太奇怪了，他们为什么偏要制造一场核大战来解决问题，又怎能保证美国将来能在一场核大战中取胜？”
    接近台湾当局的“联合报”也在杜勒斯到达台北的当天（21日）发表社论，要求杜勒斯同蒋介石在台北会谈里“获致一个硬朗而坚决的协议”。社论说，“这个协议应该包括下列三点”：第一，保证美蒋“永为反共的盟邦，美国决不自台湾海峡退却”；第二，“确切说明”蒋介石集团“有权保卫金马”，美国“有义务援助（蒋介石集团）为防卫外岛的战争”；第三，美国“决定立即停止”华沙会谈。
