Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Kaneda Tomitaro, Vice Chairman of the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions (Sohyo) and head of the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions delegation currently visiting China, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters today regarding the situation in the Taiwan Strait area, strongly condemning the United States' crude interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people. He said that the United States' consistent interference in China's internal affairs is intolerable, and the United States must stop this interference. If the United States insists on interfering in China's internal affairs, it must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

	Kaneda Tomitaro said that the Chinese people have flesh-and-blood ties and compatriotic relations; it is only due to the interference of the United States and the suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek Group that the part of the Chinese people currently under the control of the Chiang Kai-shek Group still cannot realize their desire to return to the big family of the motherland.

	Referring to the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government's following the United States' aggressive policy in the Far East, Kaneda Tomitaro said that Japan should consider its own problems. The Japanese government should change its position of following the United States and choose the path of safeguarding the interests of the Japanese nation.

	Kaneda Tomitaro denounced the Kishi Nobusuke government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' denial in a memorandum to the Soviet Union on October 2nd that the United States was using Japanese territory to carry out aggression against China as "disregarding the facts." He pointed out that American planes taking off from American bases in Japan have carried out provocative actions against the Chinese people; the United States is making maximum use of the bases in Okinawa to carry out military interference in China. The Kishi Nobusuke government's denial of this fact is a deceptive act in international relations and also a deception of the Japanese people.

	Kaneda Tomitaro said that the Kishi Nobusuke government's current policy of following the United States has the danger of dragging Japan into the abyss of war. It is necessary for the Japanese people to strengthen their struggle against this dangerous policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

	Referring to the Japanese people's, especially the Japanese working class', struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of succumbing to the United States, Kaneda Tomitaro said that the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions has always demanded the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which could drag Japan into American adventurous actions. The Japanese General Council of Trade Unions has decided to launch a large-scale movement starting in October to demand the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, the abolition of the Japan-Chiang treaty, and opposition to the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He said that the Japanese General Council of Trade Unions will implement the spirit of the joint statement signed with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on October 3rd into this movement.

	Kaneda Tomitaro finally said that Asian affairs should be handled by Asians themselves. Asia has suffered from American aggression for a long time; the United States should now withdraw from Asia, and Asians should build a peaceful Asia in the spirit of Bandung.

    日本工人反对岸政府当侵略者的帮凶
    兼田表示坚决支持我国正义斗争
    新华社6日讯　目前在中国访问的日本工会总评议会副议长、日本工会总评议会代表团团长兼田富太郎今天就台湾海峡地区局势对新华社记者发表谈话，强烈指责美国对中国人民内部事务的横暴干涉。他说，美国一贯对中国内政进行的干涉是不能令人容忍的，必须使美国停止这种干涉。如果美国坚持对中国内政进行干涉，它就必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
    兼田富太郎说，中国人民之间有血肉关系和同胞关系；只是由于美国的干涉和蒋介石集团的压制，目前在蒋介石集团控制下的那部分中国人民仍然不能实现他们要求回到祖国大家庭中的愿望。
    谈到日本岸信介政府追随美国在远东的侵略政策时，兼田富太郎说，日本应该考虑它自己的问题。日本政府应该改变它追随美国的立场，而选择维护日本民族利益的道路。
    兼田富太郎指责岸信介政府外务省在10月2日致苏联的备忘录中否认美国利用日本领土来进行对中国的侵略的说法是“不顾事实的”。他指出，从在日本的美国基地上起飞的美国飞机进行了对中国人民的挑衅行动；美国最大限度地使用在冲绳的基地对中国进行军事干涉。岸信介政府否认这一事实是国际关系中的欺骗行为，也是对日本人民的欺骗行为。
    兼田富太郎说，岸信介政府目前执行的追随美国的政策有把日本拖进战争深渊的危险。日本人民有必要加强反对岸信介政府的这种危险政策的斗争。
    谈到日本人民，特别是日本工人阶级反对岸信介政府屈从美国的政策的斗争时，兼田富太郎说，日本工会总评议会从来就要求废除有可能把日本卷进美国冒险行动的日美“安全条约”。日本工会总评议会已经决定从10月起展开大规模的运动，要求恢复日中邦交，废除日蒋条约，并且反对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，日本工会总评议会将把它同中华全国总工会在10月3日签署的联合声明的精神贯彻到这个运动中去。
    兼田富太郎最后说，亚洲的事务应该由亚洲人自己来处理。亚洲长时期以来遭受美国的侵略；美国现在应该撤出亚洲，而由亚洲人本着万隆精神建立和平的亚洲。
