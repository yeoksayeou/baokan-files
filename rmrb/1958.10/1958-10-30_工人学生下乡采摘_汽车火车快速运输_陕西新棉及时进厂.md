Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 29th: Shaanxi Province has made timely arrangements for the supply of cotton, ensuring the normal production of more than 630,000 spindles in the province. As of the 20th, more than 12.22 million jin of new cotton had been transported to textile factories.

This year, Shaanxi's cotton harvest was abundant, but due to heavy rains after autumn, the time for new cotton to enter the market was delayed compared to previous years. In addition, because various places were busy with steelmaking and autumn agricultural production, labor and transportation were not prioritized for cotton purchasing and transportation. Therefore, in late September, thirteen cotton textile factories in the province faced a serious threat of work stoppage due to lack of materials. After learning about this situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately convened an emergency meeting, determining to take seven specific measures to do everything possible to ensure that textile factories did not stop production. According to the instructions of the Provincial Committee, the textile departments mobilized 40,000 textile workers during their breaks, and more than 3 million primary and secondary school students across the province, to go to the countryside to help farmers pick cotton. After more than ten days of hard work, about 80% of the province's more than 4.7 million mu of cotton has been picked. More than 20,000 textile workers in the Xi'an "Textile City" helped three people's communes in the Baqiao District to recover most of their cotton. Now, the farmers in Baqiao District have supplied more than 56,000 jin of new cotton to various factories for production. Various textile factories have also sent technicians to Gaoling, Jingyang, Xianyang, Chang'an and other counties to help ginning factories install new machines and strengthen ginning capacity. Xianyang Ginning Factory originally had difficulties in installing machines, but later received assistance from technicians from Xianyang Textile Factory. They installed the machines and can gin more than 1.8 million jin of lint cotton every day. They have now sent more than 180,000 jin of raw cotton to three textile factories in Xianyang.

In order to transport cotton to various textile factories in a timely manner, the transportation departments are also trying various ways to tap potential. The railway department has rearranged transportation capacity. While ensuring the completion of steel transportation tasks, it is stepping up the completion of cotton transportation tasks. From October 10th to 14th, they used methods such as carrying cotton in coal cars, loading cotton in passenger cars, and loading cotton in freight car guard cars, delivering the 92 trainloads of cotton originally accumulated at various stations to their destinations one day ahead of schedule. In order to supply textile industry raw materials as soon as possible, all localities are striving to transport the cotton as soon as it arrives.

    陕西新棉及时进厂
    据新华社西安29日电　陕西省及时安排棉花供应工作，保证了全省六十三万多枚纱锭一直正常生产。截至20日统计，已有一千二百二十多万斤新棉运到纺织厂。
    今年陕西棉花大丰收，但因秋后多雨，新棉上市时间比往年推迟。加上各地忙于炼钢铁和秋季农业生产，劳动力和运输力量没有排到棉花收购、调运等方面来，因此在9月下旬，全省十三个棉纺织厂曾面临严重的停工待料威胁。中共陕西省委了解到这一情况后，立即召集紧急会议，确定采取七项具体措施，尽一切努力保证纺织厂不停工。纺织部门根据省委指示，动员了四万纺织工人在休班空隙时间，和全省三百多万中小学生一起，下乡帮助农民摘棉花。经过十多天苦战，已将全省四百七十多万亩棉花采摘80％左右。西安“纺织城”的二万多纺织工人，帮助坝桥区三个人民公社将绝大部分棉花拾回。现在，坝桥区的农民已将五万六千多斤新棉供应各厂生产。各纺织厂还派出技术人员到高陵、泾阳、咸阳、长安等县帮助轧花厂安装新机器，加强轧花力量。咸阳轧花厂原来安装机器有困难，后来得到咸阳纺织厂技术人员的帮助，安装好机器，每天可轧出一百八十多万斤皮棉，现在已给咸阳三个纺织厂送去十八万多斤原棉。
    为了把棉花及时输送到各纺织厂，交通部门也想各种办法挖掘潜力。铁路部门重新安排了运输力量，在保证完成钢铁运输任务的同时，加紧完成棉花运输任务。10月10日到14日，他们就用煤车带花、客车装花、货车的守车装花等办法，把原积压在各站的九十二车棉花，比计划提前一天送到目的地。各地为了尽快供应纺织工业原料，都努力做到随到随运。
