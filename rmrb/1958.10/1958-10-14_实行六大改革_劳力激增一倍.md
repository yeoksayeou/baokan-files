    Implement Six Major Reforms: Labor Force Increases by One-Fold

    (Our dispatch) After Huanjiang County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region implemented six major reforms in labor power, the labor force投入 committed to the current agricultural production has increased by more than one-fold.

    In order to mobilize all personnel to actively participate in the current industrial and agricultural production, the county has universally implemented six major labor reforms: (1) Changed small canteens into large canteens. The Xianfeng People’s Commune originally had one canteen per small team. Now, there is one canteen per production zone. The number of canteens has been reduced from 240 to 25, saving a total of 80 people. (2) Changed scattered and fragmented nurseries into relatively centralized nurseries. The Huojian People’s Commune combined 27 nursery groups into nurseries, saving 61 management personnel. (3) Adjusted sideline organizations and established specialized teams, concentrating the commune’s pigs, cattle, and duck flocks for feeding, which can solve the feed problem and save labor. (4) Changed small production teams into large production teams or established sub-teams to use labor in a unified manner. (5) Organized commercial and handicraft workers in market towns to participate in industrial and agricultural production. In market towns with a high concentration of commerce and handicrafts, 50% of the people are regularly drawn to participate in labor. (6) Schools universally implement work-study programs and part-work, part-study.

    In the above reforms, wherever women and semi-able-bodied laborers can replace the main labor force, for example, in service, feeding, and management, they are used to replace them as much as possible, so as to free up the main labor force to invest in industrial and agricultural production.

    实行六大改革　劳力激增一倍
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区环江县实现劳动力方面的六大改革以后，投入当前农业生产的劳动力增加一倍多。
    为了动员所有人员积极参加当前工农业生产，全县普遍实现了劳动力六大改革：（1）改小食堂为大食堂。先锋人民公社原来一个小队一个食堂，现在一个生产片一个食堂，食堂数量就由二百四十个减少到二十五个，共节省八十人。（2）将分散的、零星的托儿所改为比较集中的托儿园，火箭人民公社把二十七个托儿组合并成托儿园，节省了六十一个管理人员。（3）调整副业组织，成立专业队，将公社的猪、牛、鸭群集中喂养，既可解决饲料问题，又可节省劳力。（4）把小生产队改为大生产队，或成立分队，统一使用劳动力。（5）把圩镇上的商业、手工业者组织起来参加工农业生产。在商业、手工业较集中的圩镇，经常抽出50％的人参加劳动。（6）学校普遍实行勤工俭学、半工半读。
    在上述改革中，凡是妇女、半劳动力能代替主要劳力的，例如参加服务、饲养、管理等，尽量由他们来代替，以便抽出主要劳力投入工农业生产。
