Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, issued a statement saying that all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association fully support the letter to Taiwan compatriots issued by Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai. We believe that the letter to Taiwan compatriots expresses the deep sympathy and concern of the people of the motherland for the Taiwan compatriots in deep waters. At the same time, it once again extended a helping hand to the Taiwan military and political authorities. Any conscientious Chinese, facing such a righteous and affectionate message, cannot and should not remain indifferent. We want to tell the Taiwan compatriots and the Taiwan military and political authorities that only by bravely breaking the shackles of U.S. imperialism and returning to the embrace of the motherland can you forever get rid of the life of relying on others, humiliating and poor. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the motherland are carrying out national construction by leaps and bounds. Our country is becoming stronger and stronger, our national defense is becoming more and more consolidated, and the people's lives are becoming more and more affluent. We will never allow any imperialism to invade us again. We sincerely hope that the Taiwan compatriots and the Taiwan military and political authorities can sincerely accept the hopes and requirements put forward by Minister Peng Dehuai in the letter to Taiwan compatriots, and unite with the people of the motherland under the banner of patriotism to build the motherland, to smash the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and to defend the Far East and world peace.

    民建主任委员黄炎培说
    台湾同胞应结束屈辱生活
    新华社7日讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培发表谈话说，我们中国民主建国会全体会员，完全拥护国防部彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书。我们认为，告台湾同胞书表达了祖国人民对于水深火热中的台湾同胞的深切同情和关怀，同时，再一次向台湾军政当局伸出了救援之手。任何一个有良心的中国人，面对这样义正辞严而又情意深长的文告，不可能也不应该无动于衷。我们要告诉台湾同胞和台湾军政当局，你们只有勇敢地挣断美帝国主义的枷锁，回到祖国的怀抱里来，才能够永远摆脱那种仰人鼻息、屈辱而穷困的生活。现在，祖国人民在中国共产党的领导下，一日千里地进行着国家建设，我们的国家愈来愈强大了，国防愈来愈巩固了，人民生活愈来愈富足了，决不容许任何帝国主义再来侵略我们。我们深切希望，台湾同胞和台湾军政当局，能够真诚接受彭德怀部长在告台湾同胞书中提出的希望和要求，和祖国人民在爱国主义旗帜下一致团结起来，为建设祖国、为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略、为保卫远东和世界和平而共同奋斗。
