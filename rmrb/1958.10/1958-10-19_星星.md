    Forming a Reserve Division
    In order to be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, the reclamation area’s various farms, institutes, and schools have all established reserve divisions and reserve hospitals. The original First Branch Farm of Yong’an Farm is now "Yonghong First Company." The farm’s workers are organized into three infantry platoons, and the machinery team is formed into a tank platoon. These people, who are both farmers and soldiers, say: We are a mighty production labor force in peacetime, and an elite force to strike at imperialism in wartime.
    
    Modifying an X-ray Machine
    Liu Shuren, Dong Nairu, Wang Lin, and other comrades from the radiology department of the First Workers’ Hospital in the reclamation area, through sleepless nights and tireless efforts of repeated failures, research, and experimentation, finally modified a general fluoroscopy X-ray machine into a versatile X-ray machine capable of indirect photography, tomography, kymography, double fluoroscopy, continuous photography, knee joint air contrast arthrography, dental cone photography, and pelvic measurement. This modification saved the state more than 50,000 yuan.

    Running an Agricultural University
    The first university of the Mishan Reclamation Bureau, the Agricultural University, with over 1,000 students, has already started classes. This university has three departments: agricultural economics, agricultural machinery, and agronomy, as well as an animal husbandry and veterinary branch (at the Mudanjiang Breeding Farm).
    
    “Combining work and study, unifying the school and the farm, part-time work and part-time study, self-sufficiency” is the school's guiding principle. This university is both a school and a farm; the students here are both students and agricultural workers. The school adopts three learning methods based on the production season: full-day classes; half-day labor and half-day classes; and full-day labor.

    成立预备师
    为了随时准备着响应祖国的召唤，垦区各场、院、校都成立了预备师、预备医院。原来永安农场一分场现在已是“永红一连”了，分场的农工组织成三个步兵排，机务队编成一个坦克排。这些是农又是兵的人说：我们平时是生产劳动大军，战时是打击帝国主义的精锐兵团。
    改装爱克斯光器
    垦区第一职工医院放射线科柳树仁、东乃儒、王林等同志，在通宵不睡，失败了再研究、再试验苦干中，终于把一般透视用的爱克斯光机，改制成能做间接摄影、断层摄影、计波摄影、双人透视、连续摄影、膝关节充气造影、牙科遮光筒摄影和骨盆测量等多种用途的万能爱克斯光机。这项改装，共给国家节约五万多元。
    办农业大学
    拥有一千多学生的密山农垦局的第一所大学——农业大学，已经开课了。这所大学设有：农业经济、农业机械、农学三系和一个畜牧兽医分校（在牡丹江种畜场）。
    “勤工俭学，校场合一，半工半读，自给自足。”是这个学校的办校方针。这所大学，是学校，又是农场；这里的学生，是学生又是农业工人。这个学校根据生产季节采取：全日上课；半日劳动，半日上课；全日劳动三种学习方法。
