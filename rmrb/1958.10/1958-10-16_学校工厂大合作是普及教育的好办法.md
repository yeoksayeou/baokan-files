School-Factory Cooperation is a Good Way to Popularize Education
Li Qikun, Vice Principal of Changchun No. 8 Middle School

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council's instructions on education work put forward the great call to "popularize higher education in about fifteen years," which is a guiding light on the road ahead for educators and a great encouragement to all our teachers and students. When we saw "the future direction is for schools to run factories and farms, and for factories and agricultural cooperatives to run schools" and "the country will have three main types of schools," we were simply too excited. This is not only because the Party told us how education should be combined with productive labor, and that our country's education will leap forward at a rapid pace; at the same time, it also allows us to specifically see the concrete ways and forms in which the boundaries between mental and physical labor are gradually disappearing. As cadres engaged in education work, how can we suppress the excitement and joy in our hearts when we see this path and form that is essentially transitioning to communism?
    Our school is a regular middle school with more than 2,200 students that only established high school classes this summer. Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, we started work-study programs in the spring. In April and May, the forms of half-work and half-study, and half-farming and half-study appeared here. During the summer vacation, half-work and half-study was piloted in three classes. This semester, it has been fully implemented and is being piloted in all forty classes of the school.
    Our school's half-work and half-study, from preparation to trial implementation, is in cooperation with the Hengli Cotton Weaving Factory. From this spring to now, our cooperation with the Hengli Cotton Weaving Factory mainly includes the following aspects:
    First, we lent most of our unused dormitory building to the Hengli Factory as the factory's main production workshop; the Hengli Factory allows our students to engage in productive labor in this workshop.
    Second, the Hengli Factory sent us twelve electric grid machines and power equipment; we built a factory building and established the "Young Pioneer Grid Factory" to process (grid lines) for the Hengli Factory—solving a weaving process for the Hengli Factory.
    Third, the half-work and half-study of factory workers and the half-work and half-study of school students are combined; we help the Hengli Factory organize workers' half-study and send our teachers to teach workers cultural and technical theory courses; the Hengli Factory helps us organize production, and organizes workers to teach students production techniques, and sends technicians to guide our production.
    The cooperation between us and the Hengli Factory has now reached this level: our vice principal is also the vice director of the Hengli Factory, and the vice director of the Hengli Factory is also the vice principal of No. 8 Middle School.
    We have learned from our own practice that the Party Central Committee and the State Council's "Instructions on Education Work" put forward the policy of education serving proletarian politics, combining education with productive labor, and the measures of factories running schools and schools running factories are all very correct. Several months of practice have proved that school-factory cooperation, the combination of students' half-work and half-study and workers' half-work and half-study, has great benefits. From the school's point of view:
    First, it is conducive to cultivating new people.
    When the form of half-work and half-study first appeared in our school, students learned techniques from workers every day. The master workers used their rest time to tell students about the lives of textile workers in the past: apprentices couldn't even touch the machine for a year, they just did some chores like burning firewood and taking care of children. They also talked about how the country treats workers now. In fact, it was a political lesson comparing the old and new societies that could not be taught in school.
    During the summer vacation, when we piloted half-work and half-study in three classes, we chose an article called "The Death of Little Ni'er" from the "Factory History" special page of the People's Daily on August 15th, as a formal text for students' Chinese language class. This article was written by a textile worker from Tianjin. It is an article describing how a girl who was learning to weave tragically died under the devastation of the old society. When the teacher finished reading the text, almost all the students were in tears, some even crying out loud, and some were still crying after class. Because they had experience in the lives of textile workers from their daily production labor and contact with workers, and when compared with Little Ni'er, they couldn't help but feel the hatred of the old society and the loveliness of the new society. Now there are hundreds of young textile workers in the school, most of whom know two kinds of textile technology, some know three, and some even know five. These young girls are almost basically skilled textile workers.
    Second, it is conducive to reforming teaching and transforming teachers' thinking.
    In the process of cooperating with factories and implementing half-work and half-study, teachers' activities have also changed. They must not only manage "study" but also manage "work." The situation forces teachers to learn technology. This requires working with students and coming into contact with production and workers. This is beneficial to promoting the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants, and it is also beneficial for teachers to understand students and overcome subjectivism and dogmatism in teaching. For example, when teaching proportions, wooden gears were used as teaching tools in the past, but students still didn't understand; now, when teachers mention the weaving machine in class or point it out next to the machine, students will understand. For example, the "static point" mentioned in physics class is difficult for students to understand, but when the teacher points to the "eccentric wheel" next to the machine, the students say, "That's how it is!"
    Third, it is conducive to the development of production and the development of education.
    School-factory cooperation and the implementation of half-work and half-study can obtain certain economic benefits. For example, the profits turned over by the "Grid Factory" can make the school (in this part of the students) self-sufficient. According to the school's actual expenditure last year, the state needs to spend 60.27 yuan to train a student, but now students can turn over 149.68 yuan, and there is a surplus of 89.41 yuan after self-sufficiency. With this money, 1.48 more students can be trained. That is to say, the state can expand the middle school by 2.48 times with the same amount of money.
    More importantly: students participating in labor production liberate a batch of labor force. As far as Hengli Factory is concerned, with the students of our school investing in production, the factory's labor force increased by 100%, and the output value can be expanded by 72%, and 70% of the workers participated in half-work and half-study. The school has changed from a consumer unit to a production unit.
    At present, when the workers of the factory are "half-studying" next to our students' desks, our students are "half-working" next to the factory's machines. It is truly "double interlocking." The factory used half-work and half-study to solve our half-work and half-study difficulties, and we used the school's half-work and half-study to support the factory's half-work and half-study. The situation of the school being a factory, the factory being a school, the students being workers, and the workers being students has already appeared here.
    In short, school-factory cooperation, the combination of school and factory's half-work and half-study, can cultivate laborers who are good at both writing and martial arts in a faster, better, and more economical way; it can transform education workers and reform teaching in a faster, better, and more economical way; and it can develop production and develop education in a faster, better, and more economical way. In a word, it can build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    Encouraged by the Central Education Work Instructions, our school will soon have five simultaneous developments in production: industry and agriculture, light and heavy, large and small, indigenous and foreign, and on and off campus. Students' participation in labor will have four forms: school-run factories, cooperation with Hengli Cotton Weaving Factory, class-run factories, and off-campus connections. From these five simultaneous developments and four forms, we can not only achieve the goal of sending higher quality college students to universities, but also train skilled technicians, and at the same time, it is also conducive to popularizing higher education for employees. All our teachers and students are working hard towards this specific goal.

    学校工厂大合作是普及教育的好办法
    长春市第八中学副校长　李启昆
    中共中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示中，提出了“我们将以十五年左右的时间来普及高等教育”的伟大号召，是教育工作者前进道路上的一盏指路明灯，对我们全校师生是一个极大的鼓舞。当我们看到“今后的方向，是学校办工厂和农场，工厂和农业合作社办学校”和“全国将有三类主要的学校”的时候，我们简直是太兴奋了。这不仅是因为党告诉我们教育应该怎样去和生产劳动相结合，告诉了我们我国的教育事业将是以飞快的速度向前跃进；同时，也使我们具体地看到脑力劳动和体力劳动界限逐渐消失的具体途径和形式。做为从事教育工作的干部，看到了这种实质上是向共产主义过渡的途径和形式的时候，又怎能抑制住自己内心的兴奋和高兴呢？
    我们学校，是一个从今年暑期才新设高中班的、有两千二百多名学生的正规普通中学。在党的教育方针照耀下，从今春我们就开始了勤工俭学活动。4、5月份曾经在我们这里出现过半工半读、半耕半读的形式。暑假又在三个班中试行半工半读。本学期，已经全面推开，在全校四十个班中试行半工半读。
    我们学校的半工半读，从准备到试行，都是和恒利棉织厂合作的。从今春到现在，我们和恒利棉织厂合作主要有以下几个方面：
    第一，我们把不用的宿舍大楼的大部分，借给恒利厂，作为工厂的主要生产车间；恒利厂允许我们学生在这个车间中从事生产劳动。
    第二，恒利厂送给我们十二台电力格线机和动力设备；我们盖一所厂房，成立“红领巾格线厂”给恒利厂加工（格线）——解决恒利厂一个织布的工序。
    第三，工厂工人的半工半读和学校学生的半工半读互相结合；我们帮助恒利厂组织工人的半读，并派我们的教师教工人的文化课和技术理论课；恒利厂帮助我们组织生产，并组织工人教给学生生产技术，派技工指导我们的生产。
    我们和恒利厂之间的合作，目前已经达到这样的程度：我们的副校长兼恒利厂的副厂长，恒利厂的副厂长兼八中的副校长。
    我们从自己的实践中体会到，党中央和国务院“关于教育工作的指示”中提出的教育为无产阶级的政治服务，教育与劳动生产相结合的方针，和工厂办学校，学校办工厂的措施，都是非常正确的，几个月的实践证明：学校和工厂合作，学生的半工半读和工人的半工半读相结合，有很大好处。从学校这方面来说：
    第一，有利于培养新人。
    在我校刚出现半工半读的形式时，学生天天和工人在一起向工人学习技术。工人师傅利用休息时间给学生讲过去纺织工人的生活：学徒一年也摸不到机器，只是干一些烧火、抱小孩的活。又说现在国家怎样对待工人。实际上是给学生上了一堂在学校里不可能上的新旧社会对比的政治课。
    暑假在三个班试行半工半读时，我们选择了人民日报8月15日“工厂史”专页中有一篇叫“小妮子的死”的文章，做为正式课文给学生讲语文课。这篇文章是一位天津的纺织工人写的。是叙述一个学纺织的女孩子怎样在旧社会的摧残下悲惨死去的一篇文章。当教师读完了课文的时候，学生几乎都流泪了，有的甚至哭出声来，有的下课还在哭。因为他们在日常生产劳动中，和工人接触中有了纺织工人生活的体会，和小妮子一对比，就不能不感到旧社会的可恨和新社会的可爱。现在学校中有几百名小纺织工人，多数会两种纺织技术，一部分会三种，还有的会五种。这些小姑娘，已经差不多就是一个基本熟练的纺织工人了。
    第二，有利于改革教学和改造教师的思想。
    在和工厂合作、实行半工半读的过程中，教师的活动也改变了，不仅要管“读”，也要管“工”。形势逼着教师去学技术。这就必须和学生在一起劳动，必须去接触生产和工人。这对促进知识分子走向工农化是有好处的，对教师们了解学生，克服教学中的主观主义、教条主义也是有好处的。如在讲比例时，过去是用两个木头齿轮当教具，学生还不明白；现在教师在课堂上一提织布机，或者站在机器旁边一指点，学生就会了。又如物理课里讲的“静点”，学生难弄懂，可是教师在机旁指着“偏心轮”的时候，学生说：“就是这么回事啊！”
    第三，有利于生产的发展和教育事业的发展。
    学校和工厂合作，实行半工半读，可获得一定的经济收益。比如“格线厂”上交的利润，可以使学校（在这一部分学生中）做到自给自足。按去年学校实际开支计算，国家培养一名学生需款60.27元，现在学生可上交149.68元，自足外尚余89.41元，用这笔钱还可培养1.48名学生。这就是说，国家同样拿出原来那么多的钱，可以使中学扩大2.48倍。
    更重要的是：学生参加劳动生产解放了一批劳动力，就恒利厂来讲，我校学生投入生产，工厂劳动力增加100％，产值可扩大72％，参加半工半读的工人达70％。学校由一个消费单位，变成了一个生产单位。
    目前，当工厂的工人在我们学生书桌旁“半读”的时候，我们学生正在工厂机器旁边“半工”。真是“双环相扣”，工厂用半工半读解决了我们半工半读的困难，我们用学校的半工半读，支援了工厂的半工半读。学校是工厂，工厂也是学校；学生是工人，工人也是学生的这种局面，在我们这里已经出现了。
    总之，学校和工厂合作，学校工厂两个半工半读相结合，可以多快好省地培养能文能武的劳动者，可以多快好省地改造教育工作者和改革教学，可以多快好省地发展生产和发展教育事业。一句话，可以多快好省地建设社会主义。
    我们在中央教育工作指示的鼓舞下，不久，我们学校在生产上将出现工农、轻重、中小、土洋、校内外五个并举。学生参加劳动将出现四种形式：学校办厂，和恒利棉织厂合作，班级办工厂和校外挂钩。从这五个并举和四种形式中不仅可以达到向高等学校输送质量较高的大学生，还可以培养出熟练的技术工人，同时还有利于普及职工高等教育。我们全校师生，正为此具体目标而努力奋斗。
