A hydro-electric power station, the largest on the Tibetan plateau, has begun partial construction.

This hydro-electric power station is being built on the Lhasa River in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa. When completed, it will generate 6,000 kilowatts of electricity, approximately ten times the total power generated by the Lhasa Duodi Gully Power Plant, which began generating electricity a year ago. In addition to lighting, it will also supply electricity for industrial and agricultural production in Lhasa and its suburbs.

The Lhasa River Hydropower Station is a large-scale project, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa will undertake the entire construction task. Engineers from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power of the Central Government have been sent to help.

    拉萨河上修电站
    西藏高原上最大的一座水力发电站已经开始局部动工。
    这座水力发电站修建在拉萨市东郊的拉萨河上，完工后，可发出六千瓩电力，比一年前开始发电的拉萨夺底沟电厂的全部发电量约大十倍，除照明外，还可供给拉萨市及其近郊的工农业生产之用。
    拉萨河水电站的工程浩大，驻拉萨的人民解放军将担负起全部施工任务，中央水电部派了工程人员前来帮助。
