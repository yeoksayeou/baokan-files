Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 19th – The Autumn Agricultural Coordination Conference of Nine Provinces and Cities in North and Northeast China was held in Xi'an to discuss the main issues of running and consolidating rural people's communes and the greater leap forward in agricultural production next year. The nine provinces and cities also decided to launch a movement to create large-area, high-yield "satellite fields" next year.

The coordination conference began on the 10th and ended on the 18th. Comrades Tan Zhenlin, Li Xiannian, Liao Luyan, An Ziwen, Liu Ruilong, Chen Zhengren, and Li Jiebo, as well as the secretaries of the provincial and municipal Party committees, the heads of rural work departments, and the heads of agricultural departments (bureaus) from the nine provinces and cities of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Beijing attended the meeting. Representatives from Gansu, Jiangsu, Anhui, Sichuan, and Guangdong also attended as observers.

The conference spent most of its time studying the current issues of running and consolidating rural people's communes. The conference conducted relatively detailed discussions on issues such as the production direction of the communes, labor organization and labor system, distribution, the supply system, and the collective welfare undertakings of the communes. The following issues were particularly emphasized: 1. On carrying out socialist and communist education movements, strengthening the Party's leadership and political and ideological work in the communes, and further implementing the class line; 2. On running collective living welfare undertakings well, especially running canteens and nurseries well; 3. The organizational structure of county communes; 4. The issue of delegating county and sub-county finance, grain, and trade departments. The conference believes that at present, people's communes have been established everywhere. While establishing and improving the leadership and management institutions and various systems of the communes, it is necessary to further carry out open debates and conduct in-depth communist ideological education for the broad masses and commune cadres in accordance with the central instructions; to carry out extensive airing of views, big debates, to thoroughly destroy the "white flags" and plant "red flags," and to establish the communist ideology and moral character of cadres and the masses. This is an extremely important ideological construction task for consolidating the people's communes at present. In the organizational construction of the communes, it is necessary to further implement the class line, establish a strong leadership core of the Party in the commune's organizations and undertakings at all levels, and strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the communes; to enhance vigilance against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and to strike at those who carry out sabotage activities and strengthen labor supervision over them. The conference also believes that doing a good job in collective welfare undertakings, especially running public canteens and nurseries well, is also a key to consolidating the communes at present. The Party committees of county communes and grassroots communes should have a secretary specifically in charge of collective welfare; equip politically strong and professionally capable cadres to manage public canteens and nurseries and other undertakings, and promote advanced experience and carry out technological innovation movements to quickly run canteens and nurseries well. The commune's canteens should also grow their own vegetables, raise pigs, chickens, and ducks, and make vinegar and soy sauce to improve meals, ensuring that commune members eat well and have enough to eat, and guaranteeing the life and production of the labor army.

Regarding production, the conference believes that rural people's communes should still focus on agricultural production and implement the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. The nine provinces and cities should strive for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year on the basis of this year's bumper harvest. This year, the six provinces and cities in North China have completely changed the situation of low grain production and insufficient supply. Shaanxi and Beijing have increased production by more than double compared to last year, Shanxi and Hebei have increased production by about one and a half times, and Henan and Shandong have increased production by more than two times. The Northeast has also increased production by 42%. Cotton production has increased by more than one and a half times compared to last year. Peanut production has increased by nearly two times, and sesame production has increased by nearly one and a half times. A greater leap forward next year means striving to double or more than double on this basis. The conference believes that the fundamental experience of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production is to put politics in command under the leadership of the Party and to thoroughly solve the problems of two roads, two lines, and two work styles. To achieve a greater leap forward next year, it is necessary to further emancipate the mind, continue to remove all kinds of "white flags" that hinder the leap forward, plant "red flags" in every corner of the agricultural production front; and summarize and promote this year's bumper harvest experience, universally and conscientiously implement the fundamental laws of agricultural production proposed by Chairman Mao, such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, eliminating diseases and pests, improving tools, and strengthening field management. The conference attached great importance to the leap forward and increased production achieved this year by the Shaanbei area, Jinxi North and Yanbei areas, Hebei Bashang area, and Shandong Liaocheng and Heze areas, which have always been cultivated extensively and have very low yields. It attached great importance to the large-area, high-yield harvests of 5,000 jin per mu of corn, millet, rice, and other crops in Shouzhang and Fan counties of Shandong and Dancheng county of Henan, and required all localities to earnestly promote the experience of these areas, especially to carry out large-scale farmland water conservancy construction in accordance with the central instructions and regional conditions, and strive to deep plow all or most of the land for spring-sown crops this winter and next spring, and carry out a large-scale movement to accumulate manure and make indigenous chemical fertilizers. The conference also attached great importance to the fact that more than 200 counties across the country this year are free from various diseases and pests, believing that this fact shows that large-area, thorough control of diseases and pests is possible, and that as long as there is determination, and the laws of disease and pest occurrence can be mastered, and the masses are mobilized to repeatedly control them, it can be done. To this end, the conference requires people's communes in various places to further carry out the movement of indigenous pesticides, and in this winter and next year, eliminate various crop diseases and pests with the spirit of eliminating the "Four Pests". This winter, the masses should be mobilized to earnestly eliminate crop stubble and properly handle straw in conjunction with manure accumulation to prevent pests from overwintering. The conference also requires northern provinces to develop animal husbandry, forestry, and aquaculture; communes and teams should establish nurseries to prepare for landscaping.

The conference also made a general calculation of the labor force needed for agricultural production, water conservancy and other basic construction, commune collective welfare, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in rural people's communes this winter and next year, in addition to the labor force required for steelmaking and running industries. According to this calculation, the labor force required for agricultural production next year is insufficient. The conference believes that this problem can be solved. The solutions are: 1. Run public canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups well to thoroughly liberate women's labor; 2. Do a good job in organizing militarization and acting in a combat-like manner, and camp out in the fields when necessary to carry out surprise attacks; 3. Vigorously promote manure accumulation in the fields and actively promote self-flowing irrigation; 4. Fully tap the labor potential of idle people in cities and towns; 5. The main point is to rely on tool reform. Within a certain period of time, the labor efficiency should be rapidly improved through tool reform. The conference pointed out that existing experience has proven that tool reform is a way out to solve the shortage of labor and is a key to ensuring that various production increase measures can be implemented. This point must be grasped firmly, and the more it is relaxed, the more passive it becomes. The conference requires leaders at all levels to be determined, strive to rapidly promote it, earnestly check and overcome all ideological problems and practical difficulties that hinder rapid promotion, and vigorously solve raw material and technical problems, produce a large quantity themselves, and ensure that semi-mechanization is achieved by the end of the year. In particular, rope-drawn machines must be implemented according to the promotion plan on schedule, and must be put into use before the end of the year.

Hebei Province plans to create 13 million mu of high-yield satellite fields for various grain, cotton, and oil crops next year. The conference believes that this method is very good. After discussion, the nine provinces and cities decided to launch a movement to create large-area, high-yield "satellite fields" next year. These "satellite fields" should not be like a few mu or dozens of mu this year, but should account for more than 10% of the sown area. The specific proportion will be decided by each province. In addition, the five provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi also agreed to help the rural areas in the suburbs of the capital to generally achieve high yields next year.

Before discussing the issue of people's communes and agricultural production, this coordination conference also focused on the "Three Autumns" work of the nine provinces and cities, mainly North China. It requires all provinces and cities to urgently mobilize all rural labor forces other than steelmaking, adopt the method of setting up large camps in the fields, organize surprise attacks to harvest autumn crops (mainly picking cotton), deep plow, and autumn planting. It also requires all localities to mobilize the people in the cities, including institutions, troops, and schools, to support the rush harvest and planting. Ensure that no cotton is lost, no grain is lost, and no sweet potatoes rot, and get all the fruits of the bumper harvest. Comrade Tan Zhenlin pointed out that if one jin of cotton is lost per mu, the country will lose 900,000 dan, so it must be ensured that not even one jin is lost. Deep plowing and autumn planting are already very urgent. In addition to seizing the time to rush planting, whether planting wheat or rapeseed, all localities must prevent the occurrence of not deep plowing or even not plowing, applying less fertilizer or even not applying fertilizer, and ensure the quality of sowing. He also proposed that after the people's communes in various places have completed the "Three Autumns" work through surprise attacks, they can organize specialized teams for steelmaking, wheat field management, deep plowing, manure accumulation, and water conservancy construction according to the labor force situation and needs, and rationally use the labor force to avoid neglecting one thing and losing sight of another.

    抓紧两个关键：深入共产主义教育，办好集体福利事业
    使人民公社坚强健壮
    力争明年粮食再翻一番，百分之十播种面积成为高产“卫星田”
    新华社西安19日电　华北和东北九省市在西安召开秋季农业协作会议，讨论了当前办好和巩固农村人民公社的主要问题和明年农业生产更大跃进的问题。九省市还决定明年要开展创造大面积高额丰产“卫星田”的运动。
    协作会议10日开始，已经在18日结束。参加会议的有谭震林、李先念、廖鲁言、安子文、刘瑞龙、陈正人、李颉伯等同志，有山西、河北、山东、河南、陕西、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、北京九省市的省市委书记、农村工作部部长和农业厅（局）负责人等。甘肃、江苏、安徽、四川、广东五省也有代表列席。
    会议以大部分时间，研究了当前办好和巩固农村人民公社的问题。诸如公社的生产方针、劳动组织与劳动制度、分配、供给制和公社的集体福利事业等问题，会议都作了较详尽的讨论。特别着重讨论的是以下几个问题：一、关于开展社会主义共产主义教育运动，加强公社的党的领导和政治思想工作，和进一步贯彻阶级路线的问题；二、办好集体生活福利事业，特别是办好食堂、托儿所的问题；三、县公社的组织机构问题；四、县和县以下财政、粮食、贸易部门下放的问题。会议认为：目前各地人民公社已经建成，在建立和健全公社的领导管理机构和各种制度的同时，应即根据中央指示进一步开展鸣放辩论，对广大群众和公社干部进行一次深刻的共产主义思想教育；大鸣大放，大破大立，进一步拔白旗插红旗，树立干部和群众的共产主义思想和道德品质。这是当前巩固人民公社极为重要的思想建设工作。在公社的组织建设中，要进一步贯彻阶级路线，树立党在公社各级组织和事业中的坚强的领导核心，加强公社的政治思想领导；提高对地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的警惕，对他们当中进行破坏活动的分子，必须给以打击和加强劳动管制。会议还认为：搞好集体福利事业特别是办好公共食堂、托儿所，也是当前巩固公社的重要关键。县公社和基层公社的党委都应该有一个书记专管集体福利；配备政治坚强、有业务能力的干部管理公共食堂和托儿所等事业，并推广先进经验和开展技术革新运动来迅速办好食堂和托儿所。公社的食堂还应该自己种菜、养猪、养鸡鸭、制醋酱改善伙食，保证公社社员吃得饱、吃得好，保证劳动大军的生活和生产。
    关于生产，会议认为：农村人民公社目前仍应以农业生产为中心实行工业农业同时并举，九省市明年的农业生产要在今年大丰收的基础上争取更大的跃进。今年华北六省市已经彻底改变了粮食低产和不足的局面，陕西、北京比去年增产一倍以上，山西、河北增产一倍半左右，河南、山东增产两倍以上。东北也增产了42％。棉花比去年增产一倍半以上。花生增产近两倍，芝麻增产近一倍半。明年更大的跃进就是要在这个基础上力争翻一番到一番以上。会议认为，今年农业生产大跃进的根本经验就是在党的领导下政治挂帅、彻底解决两条道路、两条路线、两种作风的问题。要实现明年的更大的跃进，就要进一步解放思想，继续拔除阻碍跃进的种种白旗，在农业生产战线的各个角落都要插上红旗；并总结推广今年的丰产经验，普遍认真贯彻毛主席提出的水、肥、土、种、密，除治病虫害、改良工具和加强田间管理等农业生产的根本法，会议对于陕北地区、晋西北和雁北地区、河北坝上地区、山东聊城和菏泽地区，这些一向耕作粗放，产量很低的地区今年改变粗放耕作所获得的跃进增产非常重视，对于山东寿张、范县、河南郸城等地所出现的玉米、谷子、水稻等作物全县亩产五千斤的大面积高额丰收的事实非常重视，要求各地认真推广这些地区的经验，特别是要根据中央指示和地区情况大修农田水利，在今冬明春争取把春播作物的土地全部或大部深翻一遍，和开展大规模的积肥和土制化肥运动。会议对于今年全国出现了二百多个各种无病害虫害的县也非常重视，认为这个事实说明大面积彻底除治病虫害是可能的，只要有决心，又能掌握病虫害发生规律，发动群众反复除治就能办到。为此会议要求各地人民公社进一步开展土制农药的运动，在今冬和明年，以除四害的精神消灭各种作物的病虫害。今冬就应该发动群众，结合积肥认真消灭作物的根茬和处理好秸秆，防止害虫越冬。会议还要求北方各省发展畜牧业、林业和水产业；社社队队建立苗圃，为园林化准备条件。
    会议还对今冬和明年农村人民公社除炼钢铁、办工业所需的劳动力外，农业生产、水利和其他基本建设、公社集体福利和文教卫生各种事业等方面所需的劳动力，作了一次大体的计算，根据这个计算，明年农业生产所需的劳动力是不足的。会议认为这个问题可以解决。解决的办法是：一、办好公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组，彻底解放妇女劳动力；二、搞好组织军事化、行动战斗化，必要时田头扎营，进行突击；三、大力提倡田头积肥，积极推广自流灌溉；四、把城市和集镇的闲散人口的劳动潜力充分挖掘出来；五、主要一条是依靠工具改革。在一定时间内，通过工具改革，把劳动效率迅速提高。会议指出：已有的经验证明：工具改革是解决劳力不足的一条出路，是保证各项增产措施能够实施的一个关键，这一条必须抓紧，愈放松就愈被动。会议要求各级领导一定要下定决心，力争迅速推广，认真检查和克服一切阻碍迅速推广的思想问题和实际困难，大力解决原料和技术问题，自己大量制造，保证年底实现半机械化。特别是绳索牵引机一定要按期实现推广计划，务必在年底以前使用起来。
    河北省明年要创造一千三百万亩的粮棉油各种作物的高额丰产卫星田，会议认为这个办法很好。经过讨论，九省市都决定明年要开展创造大面积高额丰产“卫星田”的运动。这种“卫星田”不是像今年几亩几十亩，而是要占播种面积的10％以上。具体比例将由各省自己决定。此外，河北、山西、河南、山东、陕西五省还协议要帮助首都郊区农村，明年普遍实现高额丰产。
    这次协作会议在讨论人民公社问题和农业生产以前，还抓了九省市，主要是华北的三秋工作。要求各省市把炼铁以外农村一切劳动力紧急动员起来，采取田间扎大营的方式，组织突击收秋（主要是摘棉），深翻和秋种。并要求各地发动城市人民包括机关、部队和学校支持抢收抢种。保证不丢棉花，不丢粮食，不烂甘薯，把全部丰产果实拿到手。谭震林同志指出：如果每亩丢一斤棉花全国就是九十万担，因此必须做到一斤不丢。深耕和秋种已经非常紧迫，各地除抓紧及时抢种外，无论种麦和种油菜，都要防止发生不深耕甚至不耕，施肥少，甚至不施肥的现象，保证播种质量。他还提出各地人民公社在突击完成三秋工作以后，可以按劳动力的情况和需要，分别组织钢铁、小麦田间管理、深翻地、积肥、兴修水利等专业队，合理使用劳力，避免顾此失彼。
