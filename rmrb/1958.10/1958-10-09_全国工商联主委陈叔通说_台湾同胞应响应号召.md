Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement saying: We, the industrialists and businessmen of the whole country, fully support Minister Peng Dehuai’s letter to the military and civilians of Taiwan, and warmly hope that industrialists, businessmen and other compatriots in Taiwan will do everything in their power to realize the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.

Chen Shutong said that our motherland, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, is in a period of rapid development where "one day equals twenty years." Many of the industrialists and businessmen in Taiwan went there from the mainland, and you all have relatives and friends in the motherland living happier and better lives day by day. You must also care about the motherland and the relatives and friends on the mainland. However, American imperialism has long occupied our sacred territory of Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, preventing you from returning to the motherland and reuniting with your relatives and friends. Moreover, the cruel economic aggression of American imperialism has caused your enterprises to continuously go bankrupt, and your lives are often in a miserable state of uncertainty. Now is the time, you should respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call with practical actions, promote peace talks, drive away the American robbers, and return to the big family of the motherland as soon as possible.

    全国工商联主委陈叔通说
    台湾同胞应响应号召
    新华社8日讯　中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通发表谈话说：我们全国工商业者完全拥护彭德怀部长的告台湾军民同胞书，并热烈地希望在台湾的工商业者和台湾同胞一起，为实现和平解决台湾问题发挥自己的一切力量。
    陈叔通说，我们的祖国在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，正处在“一天等于二十年”的飞跃发展时期。在台湾的工商业者有不少人是从大陆上去的，你们都有亲戚朋友在祖国大陆上过着一天比一天幸福、美好的生活。你们也一定关怀着祖国，关怀着大陆上的亲友。但是，美帝国主义长期地侵占我国神圣的领土台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿，使你们不能回到祖国来，不能和亲友团聚；而且美帝国主义残酷的经济侵略，使你们的企业不断地遭到破产，你们的生活经常处在朝不保夕的悲惨地位。现在是时候了，你们应该以实际行动响应彭德怀部长的号召，促成和平谈判，赶走美国强盗，早日回到祖国的大家庭中来。
