Editor's note: In the joint communiqué of the Chiang-Dulles talks on October 23, Dulles forced the Taiwan authorities to accept the so-called "no use of force" principle, giving Chiang Kai-shek the right to speak on behalf of "Free China." This seemed like an agreement from the Chiang-Dulles talks. In fact, as early as October 16, Dulles revealed in a conversation with British Independent Television reporter Clarke that the United States had already made a decision to have Chiang Kai-shek accept it. This prefabricated conversation was not released by the U.S. State Department until after the Chiang-Dulles joint communiqué was issued. Below are four questions about the Taiwan situation from the State Department's released record of that conversation.

Boasting About "Flexibly" Using Strategies

Mr. Clarke: Mr. Secretary, I am very grateful that you can take the time to answer a question that is now being debated in the British Parliament. You know, there is a lot of criticism of American policy there, and perhaps some misunderstandings. I wonder if you would be willing to respond to what is probably the most common of their criticisms, which is that because you are too rigid, the United States is losing opportunities to improve peace, or opportunities for peace?

Secretary of State Dulles: Mr. Clarke, I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you and, through you, to our friends in Britain about these aspects of our foreign policy. Regarding the issue of rigidity, I do believe that there are certain fundamental principles that we believe in and that we must unswervingly adhere to. We are faced with an ideology that has an almost fanatical belief in a different concept of the nature of the world, the civilization we should have, and especially the nature of mankind and the role that man should play in it. It should only be a mechanical particle handled by the government according to material interests.

Our concept is completely different, and always has been. This struggle for human freedom has been going on for centuries, and if we do not have confidence in this struggle, are not firm, and do not go all out, we will not be able to carry this struggle to victory. On these fundamental issues, I admit that I am rigid, resolute, and unwavering.

As for the way of doing things, that is, daily means, I don't think I can be blamed for being rigid. Indeed, the criticism often made of me here is not rigidity and consistency, but inconsistency.

So I think there is room for flexibility in details, in strategy. I will try to prove this point. But on fundamental principles, I do believe in strength and firmness, and I don't think our civilization can survive the attacks it is undergoing without it.

Slandering China and the Soviet Union for Wanting to Conquer the World

Q: So, the question people don't understand is, how will all this end? When tensions may ease slightly due to some kind of disarmament agreement, what do you think the situation will be like afterwards—a period of negotiation? Or do you think communism will gradually disappear?

A: Oh, I'm not sure that communism as a social or economic structure will gradually disappear. I do see an evolution—an evolution away from what I call international communism, which seeks to spread its doctrine throughout the world. It believes that unless it controls everything, creating a state of obedience to its principles everywhere, people will not get world order and world peace. Oh, it seems to me that this form of war can only be ended by changing this policy. I don't know how we can surrender to it. And it is unwilling to compromise. It believes—as firmly as we believe in our beliefs—that their system is the solution, but it won't work unless it spreads throughout the world.

Well, it seems to me that this will gradually give way to a system that focuses more on national welfare and the welfare of the people. There is no fundamental dispute between the American people and the Russian people. As long as the Russian government is interested in seeking the welfare of Russia and the welfare of the Russian people, we will immediately see relaxed tensions. The difficulty is that these regions—the China-Soviet region, the Russian and Chinese Communists—are not fighting for the welfare of their people. They are fighting to spread a doctrine that is incompatible with ours throughout the world.

You look at China. There are millions of people starving here. But what is that government doing? It ships food out in order to gain political victories elsewhere. At our staff meeting yesterday, someone told me that they were going to send seventy technicians and $20 million to Yemen. Why are they doing this? Not because China doesn't need these technicians or this money, but because they think this is an opportunity for them to gain a political victory in Yemen. In my opinion, you cannot live in peace with such a society. But I do believe that this communism will evolve, so that it will gradually concentrate its efforts on seeking the welfare of its own people and will abandon this absurd dream of conquering the world.

Q: Is there anything we can do to speed up the arrival of that day?

A: Yes, indeed. What we can do is clearly point out that it cannot succeed. You may recall Khrushchev's speech, in which he condemned the evils of Stalinism and "the cult of personality" and all the brutality of this police state.

Q: Yes, I know.

A: He said in his speech that someone asked him, "Then why didn't you do something about it earlier?" He said, "We couldn't do something about it earlier because it was achieving such victories." Now, as long as it is winning victories, it will not change, knowing that it helps its development and winning victories. If we are firm and oppose it everywhere we can, and it cannot succeed, then it will naturally change, and it will mainly be a domestic phenomenon, not an international phenomenon.

Forced to Acknowledge China's Existence

Q: You mentioned China just now, and recently the danger of war seems to come more from China than from Europe. In Britain, many people criticize the U.S.'s China policy, and I don't think many people understand this policy.

There are two main criticisms: I will tell you the first criticism and ask you to express some opinions. We think that many of us—certainly not necessarily the government—think that the policy of not recognizing the government in Beijing is neither realistic nor, say, involves you in taking sides in a civil war that has actually ended. Would you like to comment on this issue?

A: The issue of recognition involves playing with words to some extent. Undoubtedly, we acknowledge that Communist China is a fact, because we deal with Communist China. Indeed, I feel that over the past decade, the United States has dealt with Communist China more constantly and seriously than any other country in the free world. We have dealt with it on the issue of the Korean armistice. We, and you, and France and other countries, have dealt with it in Geneva for the issue of the Indochina armistice. We have been talking to the Chinese Communists at the level of diplomats for the past four years, first in Geneva and now in Warsaw. This is a fact, and we treat it as a fact and deal with it whenever dealing with it is beneficial to the world or beneficial to peace, we do not hesitate to deal with it.

There is also another form of recognition, that is, diplomatic recognition. This recognition would bring great benefits to the recognized country. This would give it control over assets around the world; this would give it prestige among overseas Chinese, who to a very large extent expect to receive its leadership. In many countries of the world, if they recognize the Chinese Communists, they will transfer such a large asset of interests of overseas Chinese, which is very likely to lead to subversion and overthrow of the government.

We now, we don't see that we have any particular reason to give such great benefits to a regime that openly declares extreme hostility to us and hostility to all the principles we believe in. This is not a blind policy, this is a realistic policy.

As I said, we acknowledge that it exists. We negotiate with it. We deal with it, as long as it is useful to do so. But, we do not allow it to obtain all the extra benefits that general diplomatic recognition would bring, because these extra benefits would only be used against us, against everything we believe in. Therefore, we believe that the practical and realistic policy is to do that.

Let me remind you that the rest of us are also implementing this so-called non-recognition policy. You can take East Germany as an example. There is a so-called East German People's Republic. It is a fact, but your government and our government do not recognize it, why? Because we believe that doing so is politically detrimental and harmful to our interests. Therefore, the guiding principle in these matters is not some detached and empty theory, advocating that you must give diplomatic recognition to a regime that is hostile to you, even if doing so will cause great disadvantage, you can choose on this issue. But, on the other hand, we also disagree with such a blind policy of insisting that it does not exist. It does exist. We know it exists. It has killed and injured about 100,000 Americans, so obviously it exists.

Insisting on Interfering in Our Country's Liberation of Taiwan

Q: I think another part of the criticism that arises from this idea is that because of this non-recognition, because of recognizing another regime in Formosa, you are not only currently, but have been involved for many years in a hostile action that is very dangerous to world peace and that will not bring us any results. I wonder if you could talk about the positive aspects of American policy, what this policy will bring us on the China issue?

A: Well, we are not in fact involved in hostile actions, except for the fact that the Chinese Communists intervened in Korea and fought with us and the United Nations and with you and other countries that have troops stationed in the Republic of Korea. There, we have fought, we have fought together against the People's Republic of China and its communist troops. Other than that, we have not been involved in hostile actions against it. The Chinese government that we have been supporting is the recognized Chinese government, we all recognized it before 1945, and we continue to recognize it, despite the fact that the revolution has achieved partial results. But, you know, the question of whether this is a civil war is completely the same as the situation in Korea; there, it is said that it is also a civil war. There, the Russians and Chinese Communists and North Koreans all believe that we are interfering in a civil war; that this is just an effort by the Koreans to unify themselves. The situation in Vietnam is the same. But we believe that in this civil war, in an occasion where it involves complicated international relations, neither side should use force.

The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed not to use force to unify Germany. It made this decision, and we are very happy. The Republic of China in Formosa has reached an agreement with us not to use force to fight back to the mainland or attack the mainland, unless in agreement with us. The only threat comes from the Chinese Communists. They have launched an offensive and may launch another offensive.

So now the question arises, if they attack, what do you do? Retreat, or retreat? We believe that the entire position of the free world in the Western Pacific, from Japan, Korea, Okinawa, Formosa, the Philippines all the way to Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, depends on maintaining a strong line against the Chinese Communists' attacks on the islands and peninsula positions that the free world has managed to maintain.

This is not a coherent line of defense like you in Western Europe. We believe that this line of defense can only be held if we persevere.

We will not attack the Chinese Communists, nor will we tolerate an attack on the Chinese Communists, but if they attack, then I think we must persevere. If we don't, I think there will be a gap in this line of defense, which will affect the entire line, and the entire position of the free world in the Western Pacific will be lost. We will be driven back home, indeed, this is the publicly declared goal of the Sino-Soviet policy. They say: "Roll back. You belong on your side of the Pacific, roll out of the Western Pacific."

### 从杜勒斯一篇谈话看——美国制造两个中国的阴谋

专栏：

    从杜勒斯一篇谈话看——
    美国制造两个中国的阴谋
    编者按：在10月23日蒋杜会谈公报中，杜勒斯强迫台湾当局接受所谓“不使用武力”的原则，使蒋介石具有代表“自由中国”发言的权利。这样好像是蒋杜会谈的协议。其实，早在10月16日杜勒斯在同英国独立电视公司记者克拉克的谈话中，已经透露了美国早已作出了决定，准备让蒋介石接受。这个预制好了的谈话，直到蒋杜会谈公报出来以后，才由美国国务院发表。下面就是国务院发表的那个谈话记录中有关台湾局势的四个问题。
    吹嘘要“灵活”运用策略
    克拉克先生：国务卿先生，你能够抽时间来回答现在英国议论纷纷的这样一种问题，我非常感激。你知道，那里对美国的政策有很多批评，也许还有一些误解。不知道你是否愿意答复一下他们的批评中大概是最普通的一种，那就是，由于你太刻板，美国正在丢掉改善和平的机会，或者说和平的机会？
    国务卿杜勒斯：克拉克先生，我很高兴能够有机会同你并且通过你同我们在英国的朋友谈谈我国外交政策的这些方面。关于刻板这个问题，我的确认为有某些基本原则是我们所信仰的，也是我们必须不屈不挠地坚持的。我们面对着这样一种主义，它对世界的性质、我们所应有的文明、尤其是对人类的本性和人在其中应起的作用，都几乎狂热地信仰着一种不同的概念。它应当只是政府根据物质利益来处理的一个机械的粒子。
    我们的概念完全不同，而且一向不同，这个人类争自由的斗争一直进行了若干世纪了，如果我们对这个斗争没有信心，不坚定，不全力以赴，我们就不能把这个斗争进行到胜利。在这些基本的问题上，我承认我是刻板的、坚决的和坚定不移的。
    至于做事情的办法，即日常的手段，我并不以为能够责备我刻板。的确，这里对我常常提出的责备不是刻板和一贯，而是不一贯。
    所以我认为，在细节问题上，在策略上，是有灵活运用的余地的。我要设法证明这一点。但是在基本原则上，我的确相信坚强和坚定，我认为，不这样，我们的文明就不能战胜它所经受的攻击而生存下来。
    诬蔑中苏要征服世界
    问：那末，人们弄不懂的问题是，这一切将怎样了结。当紧张局势也许由于达成某种裁军协议而稍有缓和，那时你认为以后是什么局面呢——一个谈判的时期？还是你认为共产主义会逐渐消亡？
    答：哦，我不能肯定，共产主义作为一种社会或经济结构会逐渐消亡。我的确看到一种进化——离开我称之为国际共产主义的东西的进化，这种共产主义设法把它的主义散布到全世界，它认为除非它控制了一切，在一切地方造成一种顺从它的原则的状态，人们得不到世界秩序、世界和平。哦，在我看来，这种形式的战争只能够以改变这种政策来加以结束。我不知道我们怎么能够对它投降。而它不愿意妥协。它相信——就像我们对我们的信仰一样的坚定地相信——他们的制度就是解决办法，但是除非它散布到全世界，否则它是行不通的。
    嗯，在我看来，这将逐渐让位于一种更着重国家福利、人民福利的制度。美国人民和俄国人民之间根本没有争执。只要俄国政府对谋求俄国的福利，俄国人民的福利感到兴趣，我们立即就会看到不紧张的局势。困难在于，这些地区——中苏地区，俄国和中国共产党人并不在为他们人民的福利而奋斗。他们为把一种同我们格格不入的主义散布到全世界去而奋斗。
    你来看一看中国。这里有千百万人民在挨饿。但是那个政府在干什么呢？它把粮食运出去，以便在别的地方取得政治上的胜利。在昨天我们工作人员会议上，有人对我说，他们要派七十个技术人员和拿出二千万美元给也门。他们为什么这样做呢？并不是因为中国不需要这些技术人员，不需要这笔钱，而是因为他们认为这是他们在也门取得政治上的胜利的机会。按照我的看法，你不能同这样一种社会和平相处。但是我的确相信，这种共产主义会发生演变，这样它会逐渐集中力量为它自己的人在谋福利，会放弃这种征服世界的荒谬梦想。
    问：我们能不能做出什么事情来加速这个日子的到来呢？
    答：是的，的确能够。我们所能够做的事情是明白地指出，那是不能成功的。你可以回忆一下赫鲁晓夫的演说，他在演说中谴责了斯大林主义的罪恶和“个人崇拜”以及这个警察国家的一切残暴行为。
    问：是的，我知道。
    答：他在演说中说，有人问他，“那么，你为什么不早一点对此有所行动呢？”他说，“我们不能早一点对此有所行动，是因为它获得了这样一些胜利”。现在，只要它取得胜利，它就不会发生变化，知道它有助于它的发展和取得胜利。如果我们态度坚决，并且在我们能够做的地方到处反对它，而它不能取得成功的话，那么，它就会自然而然发生变化，而它就会主要是一种国内的现象，而不是一种国际的现象。
    被迫承认中国存在
    问：你刚才提到中国，而近来战争的危险来自中国似乎多于来自欧洲。在英国，很多人批评美国的对华政策，而我认为，很少有人了解这个政策。
    有两个主要的批评：我向你说出第一个批评，请你发表一些意见。我们认为，我们当中许多人——当然不一定是政府——认为，不承认在北京的政府的政策既不现实，而且比如说还牵涉到你，使你在一场实际上已经结束了的内战中对一方有所偏袒。你愿意就这个问题发表一些意见吗？
    答：承认问题在一定程度上涉及玩弄字眼。无疑我们承认共产党中国是一个事实，因为我们同共产党中国打交道。的确，我觉得过去十年来，美国比任何其他自由世界国家更加不断地、认真地同共产党中国打交道，我们曾经在朝鲜停战问题上同它打交道。我们，还有你们，和法国和其他国家，曾经在日内瓦为了印度支那停战问题同它打过交道。我们在过去四年当中一直在外交人员一级同中国共产党人会谈，起先在日内瓦，现在在华沙。这是一个事实，我们把它当作一个事实同它打交道，无论什么时候，只要同它打交道有利于世界或有利于和平，我们就毫不迟疑地同它打交道。
    此外还有另一种形式的承认，那就是说外交上的承认。这种承认会给被承认的国家带来很大的好处。这将使全世界各地的资产都归它控制；这会使它在华侨中间享有威信，华侨在非常大的程度上期待得到它的领导。在世界上的许多国家里，如果它们承认中国共产党人，它们就会把华侨这样一笔的资产利益移交过去，这很可能会导致颠复和推翻政府。
    我们现在，我们看不到我们有什么特别的理由应该把这样大的好处交给一个公开宣布极端敌视我们、敌视我们坚信的一切原则的政权。这不是一种盲目的政策，这是一种现实的政策。
    正如我所说的，我们承认它是存在的。我们同它谈判。我们同它打交道，只要这样做有用处。但是，我们不让它得到一般的外交承认所会带来的一切额外好处，因为这些额外好处只会被用来对付我们，反对我们所信仰的一切。因此，我们认为实际可行的现实政策就是那样做法。
    让我向你提醒一下，我们当中的其余国家都同样实行着这种所谓不承认的政策。你可以以东德为例。有一个所谓的东德人民共和国。它是一个事实，但是你们的政府和我们的政府都不承认它，为什么呢？因为我们相信，这样做在政治上对我们的利益是不利的，是有害的。因此，在这些事情上的指导原则并不是某种脱离实际的空论，主张你必须给予一个敌视你的政权以外交上的承认，即使这样做会造成很大的不利，你在这个问题上是可以选择的。但是，另一方面，我们也不同意硬说它不存在的那样一种盲目的政策。它的确是存在的。我们知道它是存在的。它曾经打死打伤了大约十万名美国人，因此显然它是存在的。
    坚持要干涉我国解放台湾
    问：我想，由这种想法所产生的批评的另一部分是，由于这种不承认，由于承认福摩萨的另一个政权，你们不仅仅在眼前，而且已经多年牵涉进一场对世界和平非常危险的、而且不会给我们带来什么结果的敌对行动。不知道你是否能谈谈美国政策的积极方面，谈谈这种政策在中国的问题上会给我们带来什么结果？
    答：嗯，我们事实上并没有牵涉到敌对行动中去，除了中国共产党人在朝鲜进行干涉并且同我们和联合国以及同你们和其他在大韩民国派有军队的国家作战这一情况以外。在那里，我们曾经作过战，我们曾经共同作战来对付中华人民共和国和它的共产党军队。除此以外，我们并没有参与对它的敌对行动。我们一直支持的中国政府是公认的中国政府，在1945年以前我们就都承认它，我们继续承认它，尽管革命取得了部分的结果。但是，你要知道，所谓这是一场内战的这个问题完全同朝鲜的局势一样；在那里，据说那也是一场内战。在那里，俄国人和中国共产党人以及北朝鲜人都认为我们是在干涉一场内战；认为这只不过是朝鲜人要统一自己的一种努力。越南的情况也是一样。但是我们认为，在这种内战中，在它牵涉到国际上很复杂的关系的一个场合，任何一方都不应当使用武力。
    德意志联邦共和国已经同意不以武力来统一德国。它作出了这个决定，我们感到很高兴。福摩萨的中华民国已经和我们取得了一致意见，不以武力打回大陆或攻击大陆，除非在与我们取得共同协议的情况下。唯一的威胁来自中国共产党人。他们已经发动了进攻，可能还要进攻。
    因此现在问题产生了，如果他们进攻，你们怎么办？退缩呢，还是退却呢？我们认为，自由世界在西太平洋的整个阵地，从日本、朝鲜、冲绳岛、福摩萨、菲律宾一直到越南、澳大利亚和新西兰，有赖于保持一条坚强的阵线来对付中国共产党人对自由世界好不容易保持的岛屿和半岛阵地的进攻。
    这不是一条你们西欧那样的连贯的防线。我们认为，只有我们坚持下去，这条防线才能守住。
    我们不会进攻中国共产党人，也不会容忍对中国共产党人的进攻，但是，如果他们进攻的话，那么我想我们必须坚持下去。如果我们不这样的话，我想，这条防线上就要出现缺口，因而全线都将受到它的影响，自由世界在西太平洋的整个阵地将要丧失。我们将被赶回老家，的确，这是中苏政策公开宣称的目标。它们说：“滚回去。你们属于你们自己那边的太平洋，从西太平洋滚出去。”
