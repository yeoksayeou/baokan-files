Great Things, Great Scenes
    Li Zhun

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi, during his inspection in Henan this time, upon hearing that Henan Province was experiencing a labor shortage due to the all-round Great Leap Forward, said, "The labor shortage in urban and rural areas is a great thing. Our country has such a large population, and there is no surplus labor. Isn't this a great thing!"

    The very next night, at a mass meeting in a people's commune in western Dengfeng County, our commune leader conveyed Comrade Shaoqi's words to everyone. The entire audience of over a thousand people laughed happily, so contentedly, so heartily. It was as if the words of praise from the central leaders had reached everyone's hearts. The laughter was filled with confidence and strength, containing gratitude and affection. It was only under the direct leadership and infinitely warm care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that Henan has seen this exciting "great thing" and presented this brilliant and dazzling "great scene."

    Henan, whether in the past as "poor and blank" or today with the people's "spiritual uplift, high morale, and vigorous" Great Leap Forward situation, is very much like a microcosm of our country. In the short year from last year's National Day to this year's National Day, the changes in the natural landscape of Henan and the rise of the communist spirit of the people are truly indescribable. If the headline titles of the newspapers of this year were all gathered and pasted on the walls of a room, walking into the room and seeing these dazzling and inspiring news, one would truly have the feeling of "stepping into the clouds, soaring into the purple sky."

    Friends from other places write: In the minds of people in our area, Henan is simply a mythical place. On land like the Yellow River basin, corn has yields of over 30,000 catties per mu, sweet potatoes have yields of 300,000 catties, and even low-yield sesame has become angry, breaking through the 4,000 catties per mu mark. Rice, this year averaging over 1,400 catties per mu, has become a "latecomer" province of a thousand catties. Facing these astonishing high-yield records, what can I introduce? Could it be that the soil here has special properties? Could it be that there is a treasure like "Han Xiangzi planting watermelons in the Golden Hall"? No. But one thing can be introduced, and that is the people's enthusiasm, the people's spirit of daring to think and daring to act after breaking down superstitions. When you see a group of red-faced young men planting a hundred catties of wheat seeds into one mu of deeply plowed land; when you see women feeding a cornfield like they are raising their own children; when you see a sweet potato field piled with 130,000 catties of manure and deeply plowed one zhang deep, you will feel that the reason for achieving these high yields is mainly that the people have established the communist style – the Mao Zedong style.

    If grain was a low-yield area in Henan in the past, then steel was a blank. However, the people of Henan have learned a true lesson, which is that "Marxism-Leninism produces steel." Before September 15th, the daily iron production of the entire province was only a little over 1,725 tons, but on this day, it jumped to 18,944 tons. The emergence of this high-yield record has made the province's steel production leap into a new stage. "For steel!" This sentence in Henan has become the central content of people's lives. Elementary school students understand the quality of ore, and old ladies also introduce ironmaking experience when visiting relatives. It is difficult to use any thermometer to measure the people's enthusiasm for making great efforts in steel. I will only give the following two examples.

    Once, in the hazy moonlight of dusk, I went to the countryside to attend a meeting. Suddenly, an old man with a white beard, carrying a piece of iron, ran past me panting. I had never seen an old man run so fast, so I followed him closely. When I arrived in the countryside, I learned that their village had produced iron and came to report the good news to the Party committee. However, after the reporting team left, the furnace produced iron of even higher quality, so the old man carried it and shouted as he rushed over. When everyone looked at the iron he was carrying, I saw him wiping his sweat, with a satisfied smile on his face.

    Another time, a rural youth I knew, five days ago, he was still a rural young man in the village who was plowing and hoeing. Five days later, I met him on the mountain, and he was already standing in front of the blast furnace, working as an ironmaker. I asked him where he lived and wanted to talk to him. He said: There is no proper place yet. Later, when I was eating with him, I went to see a cave and found that he had been here for five days and had not unpacked his luggage. No wonder his eyes were red, and no wonder their furnace released a "satellite" the day after I came back.

    "Satellite," yes. Dear friends, wait for the good news that we will release more and bigger "satellites"!

    大好事情，大好景象
    李准
    刘少奇同志这次来河南视察，当听到河南省由于全面跃进而呈现出劳动力紧张状况时，说：“城乡劳动力紧张是一件大好事情，我国人口这样多，没有剩余劳动力了，这能不是一件大好事吗！”
    就在第二天夜里，我们在登封县西部一个人民公社的群众会上，由我们社长向大家传达了少奇同志这句话，全场一千多群众都开心地笑起来，笑得那么如意，笑得那么豪爽。好像中央领导同志们对我们称赞的话，都说到大家心窝里了。笑声中充溢着信心和力量，笑声中包含着感谢和爱戴，是在党中央和毛主席的直接领导和无限亲切的关怀下，河南才出现这种令人振奋的“大好事情”，才呈现出这种灿烂夺目的“大好景象”。
    河南，不管在过去的“一穷二白”，和今天人民群众的“精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”的蓬勃跃进局面来看，都很像我们国家的一个缩影。从去年国庆节到今年国庆节的短短一年中，在河南这块土地上，自然面貌的改变、人民群众共产主义精神的高涨，真是笔墨难以形容。如果把这一年的报纸头条标题都集贴在满屋墙壁上，走进屋子看到这些琳琅满目，振奋人心的消息，真是有“如步青云，如凌紫霄”的感觉了。
    外地朋友们来信说：河南在我们这里人们的心目中，简直是个神话的地方。在黄河流域这样的土地上，玉米有亩产三万多斤的产量，红薯有三十万斤的产量，连低产的芝麻也发起怒来了，它冲破了亩产四千斤的大关。水稻，今年平均亩产一千四百多斤，变成“后来居上”的千斤省。面对着这些惊人的高额丰产纪录，我介绍些什么呢？难道说是这里的土壤有特殊性能吗？难道说有像“韩湘子金殿种西瓜”那样的宝贝吗？没有。不过有一点可以介绍，那就是人民的干劲，人民破除迷信后的敢想敢干的气魄。当你看到一群红光满面的小伙子，把一百斤麦种种到一亩深翻地里的时候；当你看到妇女们像喂养自己的小孩子那样来饲养一块玉米地的时候；当你看到一块红薯地堆满十三万斤粪，又深翻一丈深的时候，你就会感到所以能获得这些丰产，主要是人民树立了共产主义的风格——毛泽东的风格。
    如果说粮食在过去河南是低产区，那么钢铁在过去则是一个空白。可是，河南人民取到了一句真经，那就是“马列主义出钢铁”。在9月15日前，全省每日产铁量不过一千七百二十五吨多，到15日这天，就一跃而为一万八千九百四十四吨。这次高产纪录的出现，使全省钢铁生产跃进到新的阶段。“为了钢铁”！这句话在河南，已经成为人民生活中的中心内容。小学生们都懂得矿石的质量，老太太们走亲戚也要介绍炼铁经验。很难用什么温度计来测量出人民对于大搞钢铁的热情，我只举下边这两个例子。
    一次是在月色蒙胧的黄昏，我到乡里去开会，忽然有一个白胡子老汉，扛着一块铁，从我面前气呼喘喘地飞跑过去，我还没有见过老头子跑得这么快，就紧跟着他跑。到了乡里才知道是他们村子里炼出了铁，来向党委报喜。可是报喜队走后，炉子里又出了质量更高的铁，老头就扛着喊着赶来。当大家传看他扛来这块铁时，我见他擦着汗水，脸上露出满意的微笑。
    另一次是我认识的一个农村青年，五天前，他在村子里还是个扶犁扛锄的农村小伙子。在五天后，我在山上碰见他，他已经站在高炉前，当起炼铁工人来了。我问他住在哪里，想和他谈谈。他说：还没有正经地方。后来，我和他在吃饭时，去一个窟洞里看了看，才发现他来了五天，行李还没有解开，怪不得他的眼睛熬成红的了，也怪不得他们的炉子，在我回来第二天就放出了“卫星”。
    “卫星”，是的。亲爱的朋友们，你们等待着我们放出更多更大“卫星”的喜讯吧！
