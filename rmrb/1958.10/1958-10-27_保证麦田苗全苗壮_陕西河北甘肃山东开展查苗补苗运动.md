Guarantee Seedling Emergence and Vigor in Wheat Fields
Shaanxi, Hebei, Gansu, and Shandong Launch Seedling Inspection and Replanting Campaign

    (Our report) Shaanxi Province farmers are conducting a large-scale seedling inspection and replanting campaign. Shaanxi Province has sown over 17 million mu of wheat, accounting for more than 75% of the province's total wheat field area. Most wheat fields have sprouted and are showing green shoots.
    Currently, in the Loess Plateau of northern Shaanxi, the Wei River plains of northern Shaanxi, and the Guanzhong region, tens of thousands of farmers are going deep into the fields for inspection. According to the inspection, most of the wheat sown this year has emerged evenly and the seedlings are robust; however, a small number of wheat fields have experienced broken rows and missing seedlings due to nighttime sowing and other reasons. Since the beginning of October, more than 15,000 specialized seedling inspection and replanting teams in more than ten counties, including Pucheng, Fuping, Changwu, Taiyang, and Hancheng, have gone deep into the fields for comprehensive inspection, and have carried out seedling transplantation and replanting work on 30% of the wheat fields with missing seedlings. In Yao County, many cadres and farmers were initially complacent, believing that this year's wheat seedlings were growing well and that even the worst would be better than in previous years. After discovering this situation, the county leadership mobilized the masses to examine their thinking and make detailed calculations, organizing discussions on how to understand and treat the current leap forward situation, and criticizing the complacency of many people. They calculated a detailed account for the masses: calculating a shortage of 2% of seedlings per mu, each mu would yield more than 30 jin less grain (planned yield of 1,500 jin per mu), and the county's 200,000 mu of wheat would yield a total of more than 6.6 million jin less grain. This finally aroused the masses' attention. The county organized more than 2,300 inspection teams and groups to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the county's 220,000 mu of wheat fields, and successively replanted more than 19,000 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings, over-seeded 2,500 mu of sparsely planted wheat fields, and re-sowed 580 mu of severely deficient wheat fields. Wu Gong County also organized more than 50 autumn sowing acceptance and evaluation groups, which went down to the villages in seven routes to conduct zonal evaluations. After "five inspections" and "four comparisons," the county's 300,000 mu of wheat fields basically met the standards, and more than 9,000 mu of wheat fields with more missing seedlings were promptly replanted.
    Farmers in the Wei River valley, who are still sowing, are also actively repairing row planters and strengthening preparations before planting in order to fundamentally eliminate the occurrence of broken rows and missing seedlings. (Wang Yong)

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, reported that Hebei Province's wheat fields are already a new green. Most of the 35.6 million mu of winter wheat have sprouted. Various places are strengthening wheat field management work in an effort to eliminate the three categories of seedlings before winter. According to statistics from more than 40 counties, including Xushui and Ningjin, more than 350,000 laborers have been invested in wheat field management.
    The quality of wheat sowing in Hebei Province this year is generally good. Some farmers believe that the wheat fields are deeply plowed, densely planted, and have sufficient water and fertilizer, so there is no problem in obtaining a bumper harvest, thus giving rise to a sense of complacency that once the wheat is sown, "everything is fine." Party organizations at all levels believe that this thinking is a serious obstacle to achieving a 1,000-jin province next year, and immediately organized wheat management headquarters and committees headed by party committee secretaries, forming inspection groups to go deep into the fields to inspect the wheat fields block by block and row by row. The inspection results revealed that rough wheat sowing phenomena exist to varying degrees in various places. In Fengrun County, 700,000 mu of wheat fields were inspected, and it was found that over 235,000 mu lacked sufficient base fertilizer (less than 30,000 jin per mu), over 95,900 mu were not plowed deeply enough (less than one chi), over 90,800 mu had a sowing amount of less than 30 jin, and over 11,000 mu had lost moisture.
    Based on the problems identified in the inspection, various places are strengthening field management, striving to upgrade the three categories of seedlings before winter. Xushui County discovered that some wheat seedlings had problems such as missing seedlings, mole crickets, locusts, and yellow and weak seedlings. The county immediately launched a four-pronged campaign of crash replanting, pest control, topdressing, and wheat rolling. After two days of intense work, the county replanted more than 34,000 mu, and controlled pests on more than 47,000 mu. In order to ensure full and strong seedlings, Leting County organized 94 well-drilling teams, requiring them to complete 186 wells before the end of November, achieving mechanization of wells in wheat fields, and generally watering all wheat fields twice before freezing. Many wheat fields with poor soil moisture are being urgently watered. According to statistics from some communes in eight counties, including Yongqing, Leting, and Ba County, over 191,000 mu of wheat fields have already been watered. Some counties, in view of the short wheat sowing season and the difficulty of replenishing missing seedlings and broken rows, are also preparing to adopt seedling cultivation and transplanting methods for prevention. Some communes in Suning and Anci counties used field edges and plots to cultivate 1,100 mu of wheat seedlings, preparing for replanting next year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, reported that winter wheat sowing work in Gansu Province has basically ended. The province's 9.76 million mu of winter wheat has been sown, and it is much better than last year in terms of deep plowing, fertilization, and dense planting.
    However, this year's winter wheat sowing preparation work was prepared according to the original provincial Party committee's Linxia meeting's target of 600 to 800 jin per mu next year. The recent provincial Party committee's autumn agricultural work conference proposed a goal of doubling or even increasing the yield per mu next year, which requires more advanced measures to ensure it. According to the new requirements, there are still many shortcomings in this year's winter wheat sowing situation across the province. For example, about 20% of the land has not been deeply plowed or the deep plowing is very poor, about 10% of the land has less than 5,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu, and there are still some cases of sowing without fertilizer. To this end, various places have generally mobilized the masses to inspect, debate, and evaluate, and are carrying out winter wheat sowing remedial work. Focus is on the following four aspects: First, inspect and replant seedlings. It is proposed to be like Ning County, bringing rulers, abacuses, and wheat seeds when inspecting, looking and calculating on the ground, replanting if it is sparse, and replanting all areas with less than 400,000 plants per mu, and re-sowing areas with only tens of thousands of plants, to ensure that every piece of wheat field is full of seedlings. Second, inspect fertilizer. For wheat fields with insufficient fertilizer, add another layer of fertilizer as needed. Third, all irrigable land should be irrigated in winter. Where irrigation is not possible, actively try to create conditions and strive to irrigate it once in winter. Fourth, before the ground freezes, generally conduct a rolling, harrowing and leveling to make it easier for the wheat to take root and tiller.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, reported that Shandong is rushing to plant late-season wheat while generally launching seedling inspection and replanting, and strengthening wheat field management. Each county in the Heze area carried out row planting on 540,000 mu of wheat with insufficient sowing of 30 jin, and carried out seedling inspection and replanting on 4.25 million mu of early-season wheat that had emerged, block by block and row by row. Various counties in the Liaocheng area are launching inspections of dry land, comparing irrigation; inspecting missing seedlings and broken rows, comparing seedling completeness and vigor; inspecting pests and diseases, comparing prevention and treatment; inspecting cultivation, comparing processing; inspecting and comparing, and replanting at the same time.
    In order to ensure that wheat fields have full and strong seedlings, after the basic completion of wheat planting, the party organizations of many people's communes promptly led the members to launch open debate, criticizing the complacency of some cadres and members who believed that "the quality of wheat planting this year is good, there are many seeds, and a few missing seedlings don't matter." Shou Zhang County organized a professional army of 25,000 people, assigning them to different areas to carry out seedling inspection and replanting, and basically completed the replanting by the 15th. Many people's communes have formulated plans to strengthen wheat field management and carry out large-scale high-yield fields.

    保证麦田苗全苗壮
    陕西河北甘肃山东开展查苗补苗运动
    本报讯　陕西省农民开展大规模的查苗补苗运动。陕西省已播种小麦一千七百多万亩，占全省麦田总面积的75％以上，大部分麦田已出苗现行，一片嫩绿。
    现在，在陕北、渭北高原和关中地区，成千上万的农民正深入田间进行检查。从检查的情况看来，今年各地播种的小麦，大部分地区出苗整齐，苗全苗壮；但也有少数麦田由于夜间播种等原因，发生了断条缺苗现象。从10月初开始，蒲城、富平、长武、邰阳、韩城等十多县，先后组织了一万五千多个查苗补苗专业队，深入田间普遍检查，对占麦田总面积30％的缺苗麦田，进行了移苗补种工作。耀县原来有不少干部和农民，陶醉于今年麦苗长得还好，认为再坏也比往年要好得多。县领导上发现这种情况后，就发动群众查思想、算细账，组织群众辩论，怎样认识和对待当前的跃进形势，批判了许多人的自满情绪。并给群众算了一笔细账：每亩按缺苗2％计算，每亩少收粮三十多斤
  （计划亩产一千五百斤），全县二十多万亩小麦共要少收粮食六百六十多万斤。这才引起了群众的重视。全县组织了二千三百多个检查队、组，对全县二十二万亩麦田进行普遍检查，先后共补种了缺苗麦田一万九千多亩，套耧补种了稀植麦田两千五百多亩，翻种了缺苗严重的麦田五百八十多亩。武功县还组织了五十多个秋播验收评比团，分七路下乡，划片评比。全县的三十多万亩麦田，经过“五查”、“四比”，基本合乎标准，有九千多亩缺苗较多的麦田，都及时进行了补种。
    正在播种的渭河两岸地区的农民，也积极检修条播机，加强种地前的准备工作，以便从根本上消灭断条缺苗现象的发生。（王永）
    据新华社天津电　河北省麦田已是一片新绿，种好的三千五百六十多万亩冬小麦，大部出土。各地正在加强麦田管理工作，争取冬前消灭三类苗。据徐水、宁津等四十多个县的统计，投入麦田管理的劳动力有三十五万多人。
    河北省今年小麦播种质量一般良好，部分农民认为麦田翻的深，种的密，水、肥充足，获得丰收没问题，因而产生种完麦就“万事大吉”的麻痹思想。各级党组织认为这种思想是实现明年千斤省的严重障碍，当即组织以党委书记为首的小麦管理指挥部、委员会，组成检查团，深入田间，对麦田进行逐块、逐垅检查。检查结果，发现小麦播种的粗糙现象，程度不同各地都有。丰润县检查了七十万亩麦田，发现一亩地施底肥不足三万斤的有二十三万五千多亩，深翻不到一尺的有九万五千九百多亩，播种量不到三十斤的有九万零八百多亩，失墒的有一万一千多亩。
    根据检查出来的问题，各地正在加强田间管理，力争三类苗冬前升级。徐水县发现部分麦苗有缺苗、蝼蛄、土蝗为害，苗子黄弱等现象，立即展开了突击补苗、除虫、追肥、轧麦等四突击运动。经过两天鏖战，全县补苗三万四千多亩，除虫四万七千多亩。乐亭县为保证苗全、苗壮，组织了九十四个机井班，要求在11月底以前完成机井一百八十六眼，实现麦田机井化，在结冻前对所有麦田普遍浇水两次。许多地方墒情不好的麦田，正在突击浇地。据永清、乐亭、坝县等八个县部分公社统计，已浇过的麦田有十九万一千多亩。有些县根据小麦种麦季节短，缺苗断垅，不易补救的情况，还准备采取育苗移栽的办法来防备。肃宁、安次两县的部分公社就利用田边、地头培育一千一百多亩麦苗，准备明年补苗。
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省冬小麦播种工作已基本结束。全省已播种的九百七十六万亩冬小麦，在深翻地、施肥、密植等方面都比去年好得多。
    但是，今年冬小麦播种准备工作，是按原来省委临夏会议上提出明年亩产六百斤到八百斤的时候准备的。最近省委秋季农业工作会议又提出明年亩产量要翻一番或者更多一些的指标，这就要求有更先进的措施来保证。按新的要求，今年全省冬小麦播种情况还有不少不足之处。例如，没有深翻或者深翻很差的还占20％左右，每亩施底肥在五千斤以下的也有10％左右，个别不施肥就下种的现象也还有。为此，各地普遍发动群众检查、辩论、评比，进行冬小麦播种补救工作。主要抓以下四个方面：一、查苗补苗。提出要像宁县那样，在检查时带上尺子、算盘、麦种籽，上地就看，稀了就算，不够就补，凡是一亩不够四十万株的全部补够，只十几万株的要翻种，做到块块麦田苗满苗齐。二、查肥。对肥料不够的麦田，按需要追上一层肥。三、能够灌水的地块，都要在冬季灌上水。不能灌水的地方，要积极想办法创造条件，争取都能在冬季灌上一次水。四、在地冻前，普遍进行一次镇压、打碾和耱，使麦子便于扎根和分蘖。
    据新华社济南电　山东各地在突击抢种晚茬麦的同时，普遍展开查苗补种，加强麦田管理工作。菏泽专区各县对下种不足三十斤的五十四万亩小麦进行了骑垅串种，对已出苗的四百二十五万亩早茬麦，逐块逐垅地进行了查苗补种。聊城专区各县正在展开查落干，比浇地；查缺苗断垅，比苗全苗旺；查病虫害，比防治；查耕作，比加工；随查比，随补种的工作。
    为了确保麦田苗全苗旺，许多人民公社的党组织在种麦基本结束后，及时领导社员展开了鸣放辩论，批判了部分干部和社员认为“今年种麦质量好，用种多，缺几棵苗不算什么”的自满情绪。寿张县组织起二万五千人的专业大军，分片包干，进行查苗补种，到15日已基本补种完。许多人民公社都已订出加强麦田管理的计划，大搞大面积丰产田。
