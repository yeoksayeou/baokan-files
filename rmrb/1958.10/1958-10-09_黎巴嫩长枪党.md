    Lebanese Phalange Party
    The Lebanese Phalange Party is a reactionary Catholic political party cultivated during the period of French imperialist rule in Lebanon. It advocates Greater Lebanonism and actively supports Western policies. It had close ties with Fascist Germany and the Vatican in the past, and later cooperated with American, British, and French imperialism. The party has about three thousand members and occupies one seat in parliament. The head of this party, Gemayel, has consistently supported the foreign policy of the Chamoun-Solh government. After the outbreak of the people's uprising in Lebanon, the Phalange Party actively participated in Chamoun's suppression activities.
    Recently, under the cover of the American occupying forces, the Phalange Party has been carrying out sabotage, disruption, and provocative activities, opposing the new Karami cabinet, and creating excuses for the United States to delay the withdrawal of its troops.

    黎巴嫩长枪党
    黎巴嫩长枪党是法帝国主义统治黎巴嫩时期培植起来的反动的天主教政党，主张大黎巴嫩主义，积极拥护西方政策。它过去同法西斯德国和梵蒂冈有密切关系，后来则同美、英、法帝国主义合作。党徒约三千人，在议会中占一个席位。这个党的头子杰马耶勒一直支持夏蒙—索勒哈政府的外交政策。黎巴嫩爆发人民起义后，长枪党积极参加夏蒙的镇压活动。
    最近，长枪党在美国占领军的掩护下，进行破坏、捣乱和挑衅活动，反对卡拉米新内阁，为美国拖延撤军制造借口。
