Blossoms of Friendship in the Sunny Sky
By our correspondent Wang Yuzhang

October in Korea is a beautiful season. The sky is a deep, clear blue with a few white clouds floating by. The harvested fields are a boundless expanse of golden rice. In the distance, the high mountains are adorned with crimson maple leaves mingling with verdant pines. Especially this year, to strengthen the friendship between Korea and China and to commemorate the eighth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering Korea to fight, the Korean people are holding "Korea-China Friendship Month" activities throughout October. The flower of Korea-China friendship, forged in blood, is blooming on Korean soil with unparalleled brilliance and splendor.

During this festival of friendship, in northern Korea, from the rebuilt, high-rise-filled Pyongyang to the mountain villages in the Paektu Mountains, the national flags of Korea and China are displayed everywhere, and the song "Korea-China Friendship Song" resounds everywhere. At train stations, factories, and schools, one can see Volunteers bidding farewell to the Korean people. They hold flowers in their hands, wear the red scarves given to them by enthusiastic Korean children around their necks, and are lifted onto people's shoulders amidst cheers. The Chinese People's Delegation, headed by Guo Moruo, is receiving an extremely warm welcome everywhere. In these days, there are countless touching scenes and stories that are impossible to fully recount or write about.

The Story of Seok Gil-ryong

"My veins still flow with the blood of the Volunteer comrades. As long as my heart beats, I will strive to strengthen Korea-China friendship!" This is what Seok Gil-ryong, a model in supporting the Volunteers, said at the founding meeting of the Korea-China Friendship Association. As she stepped down from the podium amidst enthusiastic applause, Yang Zhihua, a member of the Chinese People's Delegation, came down from the platform to meet her. Seok Gil-ryong rushed into Sister Yang's arms like a long-lost relative, and tears flowed like a spring.

Seven years ago, Seok Gil-ryong was a 19-year-old girl living in Maehyo-ri, Jangdeok-myeon, Kimhwa-gun, on the front lines of Triangle Hill. Her parents had been killed by American planes, and her brother had joined the People's Army. Six years ago, just before the "May Day" holiday, she went to the mountains to dig wild vegetables to comfort the Volunteers when she lost her left foot from an enemy shell. She was rescued by Wang Ridong, a cook from the Volunteers, and taken to a Volunteer hospital.

The half-basket of wild vegetables Seok Gil-ryong had dug was sent to the Volunteers on the front lines. When the brave soldiers of the Volunteer's recoilless gun platoon ate the vegetables and learned Seok Gil-ryong's story through a letter in the basket, they shouted "Avenge Seok Gil-ryong!" the next day and destroyed seven American tanks.

That autumn, after Seok Gil-ryong recovered from her injuries thanks to blood transfusions and devoted treatment at the Volunteer hospital, the Battle of Triangle Hill began. Disregarding her disability, she and her companions set up a tea station by the road leading to the front lines. In the freezing winter, braving enemy artillery fire and aerial bombardment, she broke ice to melt water, gathered firewood to make a fire, and handed bowl after bowl of boiling water to the passing Volunteers. After drinking the tea brewed by Seok Gil-ryong, the Volunteers fought even more bravely. The Korean women in the vicinity were moved by Seok Gil-ryong's actions and formed Seok Gil-ryong stretcher teams and Seok Gil-ryong blood transfusion teams, setting off a wave of support for the front lines.

After the armistice, the Volunteers built a new house for Seok Gil-ryong and gave her a sewing machine. Seok Gil-ryong used the sewing machine every day to sew and mend clothes for the Volunteers. In this way, Seok Gil-ryong and the Volunteers supported and helped each other, forming a bond of friendship like flesh and blood.

The comrades of the Chinese People's Delegation were all moved by Seok Gil-ryong's deeds. Chairman Guo Moruo personally presented Seok Gil-ryong with a medal, and Sister Yang Zhihua gave Seok Gil-ryong a gift, holding her hand and saying, "We will never forget you."

Isn't Seok Gil-ryong and her story a flower of unparalleled beauty in the world?

Visiting the Korea-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative

People who visit the Korea-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative can understand how deeply Korea-China friendship has taken root in the hearts of every ordinary Korean person.

The Korea-China Friendship Cooperative is located in Gangbuk-ri, Geumcheon-gun, North Hwanghae Province. The 256 households in the cooperative are sparsely arranged on a series of hills. When the Chinese People's Delegation visited on October 11, the entire village erupted in joy. Although it was the busy autumn harvest season, more than 3,000 men, women, and children from the entire cooperative and village dressed in festive attire and formed a long line along the mountain road at the entrance of the village, welcoming the delegation on both sides of the road. The square in front of the agricultural cooperative's office instantly became a sea of joyful people.

The stories of Korea-China friendship in this agricultural cooperative are endless. The cooperative was established in August 1954. In September of the same year, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed here contributed more than 30,000 man-days and spent three months building a 2.7-kilometer-long dam on the Richeng River behind the village, ensuring that the cooperative's 150 hectares of cultivated land would never again be harmed by river flooding. Therefore, the members named their cooperative "Korea-China Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative, called the dam behind the village "Friendship Dam," and called the plain in front of the village "Korea-China Friendship" Plain. There are also several "Volunteer Mothers" in this cooperative. Zhao Yunu, a "Volunteer Mother" who is now the director of the nursery, still corresponds with her Chinese "sons."

The cooperative's chairman told the delegation that the cooperative had successfully completed its grain production, animal husbandry, and sericulture tasks in both the previous and current years, and had been honored with the title of "Republic Model Agricultural Cooperative" for two consecutive years. This year, the agricultural cooperative's average grain yield per hectare is four tons, which is double the amount before liberation. Previously, there were only three wealthy households in the entire village. Since the year before last, every household in the cooperative has become a surplus grain household. This year, each household can receive 3,000 kilograms of grain and 35,000 North Korean won. The cooperative has now formulated a production increase plan for next year. The members say that they will learn from the Chinese farmers' experience in achieving high yields and engage in large-scale experimental fields. They are now planning to harvest 255 tons of rice on a hectare of experimental field and to increase the average rice yield per hectare in the entire cooperative to 15 tons, which is nearly four times the amount this year. The agricultural cooperative's chairman said that we will never forget the assistance given to us by the Chinese People's Volunteers and are determined to strengthen our friendship and solidarity with the Chinese people.

Before leaving, Chairman Guo Moruo gave the members a message, wishing the Korea-China Friendship Cooperative would develop forever like the friendship between Korea and China.

Always Advance Shoulder to Shoulder

The people of China and Korea are comrades-in-arms who fought side by side in the struggle against American imperialist aggression. Today, the Chinese people in the Great Leap Forward and the Korean people riding the Chollima are running side by side on the road to socialism.

When the Chinese People's Delegation visited the Hwanghae Iron Works, Jin Qimo, an old fitter at the factory, asked the comrades of the delegation to send his regards to Li Biping, the director of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. It turned out that during the Korean War, Jin Qimo had interned at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. When he left Taiyuan to return to his country to participate in reconstruction, Director Li Biping gave him a watch and wished him to work hard to build his motherland and race against time.

Jin Qimo did not disappoint Director Li's message. In the project to restore the No. 1 blast furnace at the Hwanghae Iron Works, he restored a 3,000-horsepower blower that people thought could not be restored, ensuring that the blast furnace produced iron more than three months ahead of schedule. He was also awarded the title of "Republic Labor Hero" for this.

This blast furnace, which was completely restored by the Korean people themselves, was praised by Premier Kim Il-sung as Korea's "artificial satellite." Now, this "satellite" furnace produces an average of 700 tons of iron per day, which is more than double the amount before liberation. By next year, they will produce 300,000 tons of iron from this one blast furnace. By 1961, they will restore all three blast furnaces in the factory, bringing the output of pig iron to 1.15 million tons.

When the delegation visited this blast furnace, they also met Han Jichang, the director of the blast furnace workshop and a labor hero. Han Jichang had interned at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in China, where he participated in the restoration of the No. 2 blast furnace and was rated as a model worker in the factory. He also used the two-stage furnace construction method he saw at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in the Korean blast furnace restoration project.

Like Jin Qimo and Han Jichang, forty or fifty employees in this factory have interned in China. In the past, they produced together with Chinese workers. Today, as Chairman Guo Moruo said, they are fighting side by side with the Chinese people on the iron and steel front.

The Korea-China friendship, with its long history and forged with the blood and sweat of the people of both countries, nourishes the land on both sides of the Yalu River like the water of the Yalu River. It is rooted in everyone's heart, and it is contained in the steel produced by workers and the rice ears grown by farmers.

    友谊花开艳阳天
    本报记者　王玉章
    朝鲜的10月是一个美丽的季节，湛蓝湛蓝的天空上飘着几朵白云，丰收的田野上是一片望不到边的金黄的稻谷，远方高山上，丹枫夹着苍松。特别是朝鲜人民为了加强朝中友谊，纪念中国人民志愿军入朝参战八周年，在今年10月举行“朝中友好月”活动，以鲜血结成的朝中友谊之花在朝鲜的土地上开放得更是无比灿烂，无比绚丽。
    在这个友谊的节日里，朝鲜北部，从重建起来的高楼林立的平壤，到白头山中的山村，到处招展着朝中两国国旗，到处飞扬着“朝中友好之歌”的歌声。在车站上，工厂里，学校里，到处都可以看到向朝鲜人民告别的志愿军，他们手执着鲜花，脖子上系着热情的朝鲜儿童送给他们的红领巾，被人们抬在肩膀上欢呼。以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团，到处受到十分热烈的欢迎。在这些日子里，有多少动人心魄的场面和故事，说不尽也写不完。
    石吉荣的故事
    “我的血管中还流着志愿军同志们的血，只要我的心脏还跳动，我就要为加强朝中友谊而奋斗！”这是支援志愿军的模范石吉荣在朝中友好协会成立大会上讲的一段话。当她在热烈的掌声中走下讲台来的时候，中国人民代表团团员杨之华从主席台上走下来同她相见。石吉荣像见了久别的亲人一样扑在杨大姐的怀里，眼泪像泉水一样涌出来。
    石吉荣在七年前是一位十九岁的姑娘，住在上甘岭前线金化郡长德面梅桧里，她的父母被美国飞机炸死了，哥哥参加了人民军。六年前的“五一”节前夕，她到山上去挖野菜，准备慰问志愿军的时候，被敌人的炮弹炸去了左脚。她被志愿军的炊事员王日东救了起来，并且把她送进了志愿军医院。
    石吉荣所挖的半篮野菜被送给了最前沿阵地上的志愿军，当志愿军无座力炮排的勇士们吃了野菜，并通过菜篮中的一封信知道石吉荣的故事以后，在第二天他们高呼着“为石吉荣报仇”的口号打毁了七辆美军的坦克。
    这年秋天，石吉荣经过志愿军医院的输血和尽心的治疗而伤愈以后，上甘岭战役就开始了。她不顾她的残废的身体，同她的同伴们一起在通往前沿阵地的路边设立了一个茶水站。在风雪交加的冬天，她冒着敌人的大炮和飞机的炸射，敲冰化水，拾柴燃火，把一碗一碗的开水捧给过路的志愿军。志愿军喝了石吉荣烧的茶水以后，更加勇猛的去作战。附近的朝鲜妇女们为石吉荣的行动所感动，纷纷组成石吉荣担架队、石吉荣输血队，掀起了支援前线的热潮。
    停战以后，志愿军给石吉荣盖了一所新房，送给她一架缝纫机。石吉荣又拿这架缝纫机天天为志愿军缝补衣服。就这样，石吉荣同志愿军互相支援，互相帮助，结成了骨肉般的友谊。
    中国人民代表团的同志们都为石吉荣的事迹所感动，郭沫若团长亲自把一枚纪念章赠给石吉荣，杨之华大姐送给石吉荣一份礼品，并握着她的手说：“我们永远也不会忘记的。”
    石吉荣和她的故事不就是一朵世上无比美丽的友谊之花吗？
    访朝中友谊农业社
    人们到了朝中友谊农业社，就可以了解到中朝友谊如何深深地生根在每一个普通朝鲜人民的心中。
    朝中友谊社座落在黄海北道金川郡江北里，社内二百五十六户人家，疏疏落落地排列在一列山岗上。当10月11日，中国人民代表团到这里访问的时候，整个村庄都欢腾起来。虽然正是秋收农忙的时候，全社全里的男女老少三千多人都穿上节日的服装，沿着村口的山路排成了很长的行列，夹道欢迎代表团。农业社办公室前的广场上，顿时形成了一个欢乐的人海。
    这个农业社的朝中友谊故事是说不完的。这个社成立在1954年8月，同年9月，驻在这里的中国人民志愿军某部出了三万多个人工，用了三个月的时间，在村后的礼成江上修了一条二点七公里长的大堤，使这个社的一百五十町步耕地再也不受江水泛滥的侵害。因此，社员们就把自己的社命名为“朝中友谊”农业社，并且把村后的大堤叫作“友谊堤”，把村前的平原叫作“朝中友谊”平原。这个社里还有好几个志愿军妈妈，现在担任托儿所所长的志愿军妈妈赵玉女，还一直同她的中国儿子们通信。
    这个社的社长向代表团介绍说，这个社在前年和去年都很好地完成了粮食生产、畜产和养蚕等各项丰产任务，接连两年荣获“共和国模范农业社”的称号。今年农业社的每町步耕地平均能产粮四吨，等于解放前的两倍。从前全村只有三户富裕户，从前年开始，全社家家都变成了余粮户。今年每户可分到三千公斤粮食和三万五千元朝鲜币。现在社内已订出明年的增产计划，社员们说，要学习中国农民的丰产经验，大搞试验田。现在计划在一町步的试验田上要收二百五十五吨水稻，并且要使全社的水稻平均每町步的产量达到十五吨，等于今年的近四倍。农业社的社长说，我们永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军给我们的援助，并决心加强同中国人民的友谊团结。
    郭沫若团长临别时向社员们赠言，祝朝中友谊社像朝中友谊一样永远发展。
    永远并肩前进
    中朝两国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中是并肩作战的战友，今天，大跃进中的中国人民和跨上了千里马的朝鲜人民又肩并肩地在社会主会的大道上奔驰。
    中国人民代表团在访问黄海制铁所时，这个厂的老钳工金琦模托代表团的同志们向太原钢铁厂的李比平厂长问候。原来在朝鲜战争时期，金琦模曾到太原钢铁厂实习，当他离开太原回国参加恢复建设的时候，李比平厂长送给他一块表，并祝他努力建设祖国，同时间赛跑。
    金琦模没有辜负李厂长的赠言，他在恢复黄海制铁所第一号高炉的工程中，把一台人们认为无法恢复的三千马力的鼓风机恢复起来了，保证了高炉提前三个多月出铁。他也因此荣获“共和国劳动英雄”的称号。
    就是这座完全由朝鲜人民自己恢复起来的高炉被金日成首相誉为朝鲜的“人造卫星”。现在这座“卫星”炉平均日产生铁七百吨，等于解放前的两倍多。到明年，他们就要这一座高炉生产三十万吨铁，到1961年，就要把厂内的三座高炉全部恢复起来，使生铁产量达到一百一十五万吨。
    代表团访问这座高炉时还遇见了高炉车间主任、劳动英雄韩基昌。韩基昌曾到中国石景山钢铁厂实习过，在那里他参加了第二号高炉的恢复工作，并被厂内评为模范工人。他还把在石景山钢铁厂看到的二段筑炉法用在朝鲜的高炉恢复工程中。
    像金琦模和韩基昌一样，这个厂内有四五十名职工曾到中国实习过，过去曾同中国工人一同生产，今天，如同郭沫若团长讲的，又在钢铁战线上同中国人民并肩作战。
    有悠久历史的，以两国人民的血汗凝成的朝中友谊像鸭绿江的水一样滋润着两岸的大地，它生根在每个人的心里，它包含在工人生产出来的钢铁和农民种出来的稻穗里。
