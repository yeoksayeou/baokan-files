American Aggressors Must Get Out of South Korea
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. This is a significant peaceful action that the whole world is watching. Eight years ago, we crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the Korean people, finally defeating the American aggression and safeguarding peace. Today, we have again voluntarily withdrawn from Korea, opening up a new situation for promoting the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. On October 28th, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement pointing out that more than five years have passed since the Korean armistice, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have taken the lead in withdrawing from Korea. Now, the United States army no longer has any excuse to continue to stay in South Korea. Therefore, it demands that the United States government immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea. This is not only the demand of the Korean people, but also the demand of the people of Asia and the world. People share the same sentiment, and millions of eyes are watching the United States: the United States army must get out of there!

However, how does the United States government respond to the peaceful demands of the people of the world? On October 27th, the United States Department of State issued a statement, making a total of two points. First, it vowed that the United States does not intend to withdraw its troops, on the grounds that the conditions for a "permanent solution" to the Korean issue have not been met; second, it believes that the "heart of the matter" is not the withdrawal of troops, but "free elections." The next day, Dulles repeated these words at a press conference. In just a few words, the Department of State and Dulles revealed the ferocious face of an aggressor. The people of the world believe that only by first withdrawing all foreign troops in Korea can the necessary conditions be created for conducting free elections and achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the logic of the United States is completely reversed: it believes that only after the "permanent solution" of the Korean issue is first realized will the United States be willing to withdraw its troops. What is the so-called "permanent solution" of the United States? It is the goal that the United States pursued when it launched the war of aggression against Korea eight years ago—to annex northern Korea. This aggressive ambition has been crushed by the Korean and Chinese people and could not be realized in the past, and it will never be realized in the future. The United States occupies South Korea, and the United States refuses to leave South Korea, precisely exposing the undying aggressive ambitions of American imperialism.

At the press conference, Dulles also raised another "reason" for refusing to withdraw troops from South Korea. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers' withdrawal from Korea is just returning to the other side of the Yalu River, while if the United States withdraws, it "would have to withdraw a distance of ten thousand miles." Dulles said that this distance is too far, and it would be quite inconvenient to return to Korea. But, may I ask Mr. Dulles, who is to blame for this? The fact that the United States is ten thousand miles away from Korea is a fact that has existed for millions of years. The United States should not have sent troops to Korea for aggression in the first place. Since the United States army was able to come from ten thousand miles away, why can't it go back ten thousand miles?

The United States army stays in South Korea to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, to divide Korea for a long time, to create two Koreas for a long time, so that it can turn South Korea into a military base and colony of the United States, thereby preparing to launch a war of aggression against Korea again one day. This is exactly the same as the Americans staying in China's Taiwan. These acts of aggression by the United States tell the people of the world that the United States is the culprit and source of trouble threatening peace in the Far East and the world.

Korea should be the Korea of the Korean people, not an American "defense outpost." The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and no interference from the United States is allowed.

The peaceful reunification of the three thousand miles of Korean territory and the reunion of the thirty million people are bound to be realized. Those who commit many injustices will destroy themselves. The United States has plunged South Korea into darkness, and its people are in dire straits. This is constantly forcing the Korean people to rise up against them and constantly creating a volcano under their feet. The United States army's refusal to leave South Korea threatens peace in Asia and the world, which is constantly prompting world public opinion to condemn the United States, making the United States a target of public criticism. The longer they stay in South Korea, the more bad things they do, the more people who oppose them will increase, and the stronger the forces that oppose them will become. In the end, there is only one way out: to dejectedly roll back home along the long journey of ten thousand miles that Dulles thinks is too far!

    美国侵略者必须滚出南朝鲜
    本报评论员
    中国人民志愿军已经全部从朝鲜回国了。这是全世界注目的重大的和平行动。八年前，我们跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民并肩作战，终于打败了美国的侵略，保卫了和平。今天，我们又主动撤出朝鲜，为促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，打开新的局面。10月28日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表声明，指出朝鲜停战已五年有余，中国人民志愿军又首先撤出了朝鲜，现在美国军队再没有任何借口继续留在南朝鲜了。因此，它要求美国政府立即从南朝鲜撤出它的军队。这不仅是朝鲜人民的要求，也是亚洲和全世界人民的要求。人同此心，心同此理，千百万双眼睛都在看着美国：美国军队必须从那里滚出去！
    但是，美国政府怎样回答全世界人民的和平要求呢？10月27日，美国国务院发表了声明，总共讲了两句话，一则发誓美国不打算撤军，理由是使朝鲜问题“永久解决”的条件尚未实现；二则认为“问题的中心”不是撤军，而是“自由选举”。第二天，杜勒斯在记者招待会上又把这些话重复了一遍。国务院和杜勒斯寥寥数语，一副侵略者的凶恶面目就跃然纸上。全世界人民都认为，只有首先撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队，才能够造成必要的条件，以进行自由选举，实现朝鲜的和平统一。但是，美国的逻辑完全相反：它认为只有首先实现朝鲜问题的“永久解决”，美国才肯撤军。什么是美国所谓的“永久解决”呢，就是八年前美国发动侵朝战争时所追求的目的，吞并朝鲜北部。这个侵略野心，已经被朝中人民所粉碎了，过去实现不了，今后也将永远实现不了。美国侵占着南朝鲜，美国赖在南朝鲜不走，正是暴露了美帝国主义的侵略野心未死。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上，还提出另一个拒绝从南朝鲜撤军的“理由”。他说，中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜不过是回到鸭绿江的那边去，而美国一撤退，就“要撤退一万英里这样一个距离”。杜勒斯说这个距离太远了，如果再回到朝鲜来颇为不便。可是，请问杜勒斯先生，这又能怪谁呢？美国这个地方距离朝鲜这个地方有一万英里之遥，这是多少万年以前就存在的事实。美国本来就不该派军队到朝鲜来进行侵略。美国军队既然能够不远一万英里之遥而来，为什么不能不远一万里而去呢？
    美国军队赖在南朝鲜不走，是为了阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，长期分裂朝鲜，长期制造两个朝鲜，以便于它把南朝鲜变为美国的军事基地和殖民地，从而准备有朝一日重新发动侵朝战争。这是同美国人赖在中国的台湾不走，完全一样的。美国的这些侵略行为，告诉了全世界人民，美国是威胁远东和世界和平的罪魁和祸首。
    朝鲜应该是朝鲜人民的朝鲜，不应该是美国的“防卫前哨”。朝鲜的问题，应该由朝鲜人民自己解决，不容美国干涉。
    朝鲜三千里江山和平统一，三千万人民的骨肉团聚，是一定要实现的。多行不义，必自毙。美国把南朝鲜弄得暗无天日，人民处于水深火热之中，这就是时时刻刻在逼着朝鲜人民起来反抗他们，时时刻刻在制造他们脚底下的火山。美国军队赖在南朝鲜不走，威胁亚洲和世界和平，这就是时时刻刻在促使世界舆论谴责美国，使美国成为众矢之的。他们在南朝鲜呆的时间越久，做的坏事越多，反对他们的人就越增加，反对他们的力量就越强大。最后还是只有一条路，沿着杜勒斯认为太远的一万英里的长途黯然滚回家去！
