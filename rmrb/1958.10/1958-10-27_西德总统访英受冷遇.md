    West German President's Visit to Britain Receives Cold Reception
    Xinhua News Agency, London: West German President Heinrich Lübke left London on the evening of the 23rd to return to his country after a three-day state visit to Britain.

    Although the British Royal Family and government welcomed Lübke during his visit to Britain, the British people were cold towards him. According to newspaper reports, there were no crowds on the sidewalks when Lübke arrived. The sounds of the Household Cavalry's horses' hooves and the clatter of soldiers' guns as they presented arms drowned out the few cheers and applause. When Lübke went to London City Hall, Londoners watched him in silence, without cheering. At the reception held by the Lord Mayor of London, some British people even refused to toast Lübke's health.

    The West German "Die Welt," published in Hamburg, said of the cold reception Lübke received in London that Lübke's visit to Britain caused a feeling of "burning shame," and that "we had better tell ourselves that the twelve years of the Hitler regime and the six years of war will not be forgotten so quickly."

    西德总统访英受冷遇
    新华社讯　伦敦消息：西德总统豪斯在英国进行了三天的国事访问之后，在23日晚间离开伦敦回国。
    豪斯在英国访问时，尽管英国王室和政府对他表示欢迎，英国人民却对他冷淡。据报纸报道，豪斯到达时，人行道上没有人群，警卫军的马蹄声和士兵举枪致敬时枪的撞击声掩没了少数的欢呼声和掌声。当豪斯去伦敦市政厅时，伦敦市民沉默地望着他，没有人欢呼。在伦敦市长举行的欢迎会上，一些英国人士甚至拒绝为豪斯的健康干杯。
    在汉堡出版的西德“世界报”就豪斯在伦敦遭到的冷遇说，豪斯对英国的访问使人感到“燃烧般的耻辱”，“我们最好告诉我们自己，希特勒政权时代的十二年和六年的战争是不会这样快地被人忘记的”。
