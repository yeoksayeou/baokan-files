Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 23rd: Shandong Province's 3.4 million-strong steel production army, with the support of other "arms," has been fighting hard through the autumn rain and cold winds for seven days and nights, and has achieved brilliant results. From 00:00 on the 15th to 24:00 on the 21st, the province produced a total of 56,812.7 tons of steel and 100,1724.3 tons of pig iron. Among them, the 21st also released a large satellite with a daily output of 29,399 tons of steel and 47,315 tons of pig iron.

This steel battle is taking place during the tense season of autumn harvesting and planting throughout the province. In order to better organize production, Party committees in various places have rationally arranged labor and divided steel and agriculture into two fronts. During this period, in addition to the round-the-clock efforts of the professional steel army, countless elderly people, women, and children participated in transportation, crushing ore, crushing scrap iron, and crushing coke. From the Jiaodong Peninsula to the western Shandong Plain, from the coast of Bohai to the southern Shandong mountains, all steel positions are bustling with activity, with furnaces smoking during the day and fires everywhere at night.

During this high-yield week, the increase in steel production was particularly prominent, with an average daily output of 8,116.1 tons, an increase of more than eight times compared to the output during the first satellite launch on September 29. Various regions have broken down the superstition surrounding steelmaking, resolutely implemented the policy of "small, native, and mass," and enabled steel production to leap forward.

### 依靠“小土群”钢产大跃进  山东平均日产钢八千多吨

    依靠“小土群”钢产大跃进
    山东平均日产钢八千多吨
    新华社济南23日电　山东省三百四十万钢铁专业大军，在其他“兵种”的支援下，冒着秋雨寒风苦战七昼夜，已经获得辉煌战果。全省从15日零点起至21日二十四点止，共产钢五万六千八百一十二点七吨，生铁十万零一千七百二十四点三吨；其中，21日还放出了日产钢二万九千三百九十九吨，生铁四万七千三百一十五吨的大卫星。
    这次钢铁战役正是全省秋收秋种的紧张季节。各地党委为了更好地组织生产，都合理地安排了劳动力，把钢铁和农业分成了两条战线。在这期间，除钢铁专业大军日夜奋战外，无数的老人、妇女、儿童都参加了运输、砸矿石、砸废铁、砸焦炭等工作。从胶东半岛到鲁西平原，从渤海岸到鲁南山区，各个钢铁阵地都是热火朝天，白天炉烟冲天；夜晚火光遍地。
    在这次高产周中，钢的产量增长得特别突出，平均日产量达到了八千一百一十六点一吨，比9月29日第一次放卫星时的产量增长了八倍多。各地破除了对炼钢的迷信，坚决贯彻了“小、土、群”的方针，使钢产量飞跃上升。
