    Autumn on the Grassland
    By Our Correspondent Feng Ye

    Autumn in Mongolia is a warm season, a busy season, and also a season of harvest.

    In autumn, the cattle and sheep on the grassland, having eaten the abundant tender grass, grow fat and strong. In the high blue sky, a few white clouds float by. In the distance, the blue sky seems to be connected to the green grassland. A shepherdess rides a steed, driving hundreds of round sheep, slowly advancing on the grassland. The sheep scramble for the pasture they love, eating as they go. What a beautiful picture of a prosperous pastoral area!

    At this time, the production of milk and mare's milk is abundant, truly like water. Herders hand over buckets of fresh milk to the state purchasing stations to be processed into butter for export. In their own yurts, milk is often left over, which they use to make various dairy products to entertain guests. During this season, people in pastoral production must also cut hay and shear autumn wool, preparing livestock for the winter. Farms and cooperatives must devote a great deal of effort to the autumn harvest of crops.

    This year, Mongolia's agricultural sown area has expanded by more than 10,000 hectares compared to last year. Now, the country has more than 100,000 hectares of cultivated land. At a time when cattle and sheep on the grassland are fat and strong, news of agricultural harvests is spreading everywhere.

    In September, we made a visit to the western Mongolian grasslands. On the vast grassland, we often saw the crops of farms and ranches. The wheat was already ripe and yellow, exuding the fragrance of wheat kernels.

    We arrived at the famous Kharkhorin.

    Kharkhorin was the place where Ogodei Khan established the capital of Mongolia more than 700 years ago. After hundreds of years of changes, it has now become the location of a state-owned farm in Mongolia. When this farm was built two years ago, it was named Kharkhorin after the old capital.

    The Kharkhorin Farm is a newly built farm. Last year, it received a state award from Mongolia for its high yield, and this year it has once again achieved a large-scale harvest.

    In the two years since the farm was established, great changes have taken place on the grassland. The previously uncultivated wilderness is now able to produce tens of thousands of quintals of grain every year.

    Old guerrilla fighter Puntsag is the best witness to the changes on the grassland. He used his personal experience to tell us about the yesterday and today of the grassland. He told us that before the revolution in Mongolia, the grassland was occupied by feudal rulers, and the herders had no cattle or sheep. After the victory of the revolution, the herders became the masters of the grassland, and tens of millions of cattle and sheep graze on this vast grassland. After the establishment of the farm, a new scene appeared. Two years ago, there were only mobile yurts here. Now, the farm has built offices, schools, clinics, and some dormitories. Workers have settled on the grassland. Now there are rows of houses and wisps of smoke, presenting a scene of prosperity.

    The farm is developing step by step from scratch, producing and building at the same time. After further visiting the fruits of the farm workers' hard work, the profound changes on the grassland left us with an even more unforgettable impression.

    Following Farm Director Purbu, we came to a hilltop in the south. From a high vantage point, the farm's more than 8,000 hectares of cultivated land were all in sight. The land is cultivated by machines, each piece being 400 hectares, very neat and orderly when viewed from afar. The wheat in the fields is golden, reflecting the surrounding green grassland, making it even more magnificent.

    The farm has more than 60,000 hectares of land, with more than 30,000 hectares of arable land, vast and boundless. Last year, only more than 3,000 hectares were sown here, but this year it has more than doubled. According to the farm's three-year plan, it will develop to 21,000 hectares by 1960.

    To the west of the farm, the Orkhon River meanders. This is one of the larger rivers in Mongolia. On both sides of the river, dense green trees stand tall. The river flows along the edge of this fertile land, and the green trees decorate the grassland scenery even more beautifully.

    The people who visited with us greatly appreciated the location of the farm, and the farm director also introduced its construction prospects to us.

    He said that among the construction projects in China's aid to Mongolia, one is a water conservancy project. The Mongolian Party and government have designated this key construction project in Kharkhorin. He pointed to the Orkhon River in the distance and said that they have decided to build a system of canal irrigation projects here, using river water to irrigate the land. The river water has to be drawn upwards, which is a relatively arduous project. Now, Chinese engineering technicians have come here and are conducting surveying work. According to preliminary estimates, the completion of the canal will irrigate 8,000 hectares of cultivated land on the farm. By then, production will be further increased.

    Purbu is an experienced old farm director, but the Kharkhorin Farm is one of the youngest of Mongolia's twenty-one farms. He said that this is Mongolia's first water conservancy irrigation project. The Mongolian government decided to build it on this young farm. The farm workers are really happy. They are all encouraged to be the first to use Orkhon River water to irrigate farmland and are determined to make production even better.

    Coming down the mountain, we went to visit the farm's production team.

    The farm is divided into three production teams, which are now carrying out autumn harvesting work. Dozens of combine harvesters are very busy harvesting wheat in the fields.

    Oats and wheat are planted in the fields. We first went to the oat fields and then to the wheat fields. Both the oats and wheat are growing well. When we stand in the wheat fields to compare, the wheat is shoulder-high. The wheat grains are plump, and the ears droop heavily.

    Last year, the farm averaged seven quintals of wheat per hectare, receiving a national award for wheat yield. This year, according to the 800 hectares of wheat that have already been harvested, the yield will exceed last year's, with the highest yield reaching 20 quintals per hectare, five quintals more than last year's national highest yield. The farm director said with great confidence that this year's average yield is estimated to reach the national three-year plan (until 1960) target of an average of nine quintals per hectare.

    On a wheat drying field, golden wheat grains were piled into small mounds, and female workers were turning the field. On the other side, trucks were constantly transporting wheat, and several young people were busy unloading the wheat. They were full of energy. Upon asking, we learned that they were middle school students from the province who came here to participate in labor and help with the autumn harvest. Every year during the autumn harvest season, thousands of college and middle school students go to various farms and cooperatives to help with the harvest. Many young people who grew up in pastoral areas are gradually becoming familiar with agricultural production techniques.

    Next to a combine harvester, we saw a young student eating lunch with the workers. We asked him if he had learned how to operate the machine. He was a little shy and said that he was learning to be an assistant.

    The farm director told us that most of the farm's tractor drivers were young herders recruited when the farm was newly built. After only short-term training, they gradually became familiar with the machine's performance in their work and were able to quickly operate the machines.

    We traveled around the edge of the boundless wheat fields for more than an hour, just visiting a corner of the farm.

    When we returned to the guest house for lunch, we not only tasted the farm's fat mutton, but also fresh cucumbers grown on the grassland. The farm director said that when the canal is built, the farm will also build a flour mill, and in the future, guests will be invited to eat flour ground by themselves.

    草原上的秋天
    本报记者　逢烨
    蒙古的秋天是一个温暖的季节，繁忙的季节，又是一个丰收的季节。
    秋天，草原上的牛羊，吃过丰盛的嫩草，长得又肥又壮。高高的蓝天，飘着几片白云，远处，蓝天好像和绿色草原连在一块，牧羊姑娘骑着骏马，赶着几百只滚圆的绵羊，缓缓地在草原上前进，羊只抢食着它喜爱的牧草，边吃边走。好一幅美丽的牧区丰收图景！
    这时节，牛奶、马奶产量丰盈，真像水一样。牧民们把一桶桶鲜奶交给国家收购站，加工成奶油出口。自己的蒙古包里，也经常剩下乳汁，他们把它作成各种奶食品，用来招待客人。在这个季节里，人们在牧业生产中还要打草、剪秋毛，准备牲畜过冬的工作。农牧场、合作社要把很大的力量投到农作物的秋收工作里。
    今年，蒙古的农业播种面积比去年扩大了一万多公顷。现在，全国已有十万多公顷的耕地面积了。在草原牛羊肥壮的时候，到处传来农业丰收的喜讯。
    9月间，我们在蒙古西部草原作了一次访问。在广阔的草原上，不时看到农牧场的庄稼。麦子已经黄熟了，散发着麦粒的清香。
    我们来到了著名的哈拉和林。
    哈拉和林是七百多年前窝阔台时代蒙古建都的地方。经过几百年来的变迁，现在成了蒙古一个国营农牧场的所在地。两年以前，这个农场兴建的时候，就以故都的名字——哈拉和林来命名。
    哈拉和林农牧场是一个新建的农牧场，去年曾经得到蒙古国家的丰产奖励，今年又一次获得了大面积的丰收。
    农场建立以来的两年间，草原发生了很大变化。以前未经垦殖的荒野，现在，每年已经能出产上万公担粮食了。
    老游击队员朋泽克是草原变化的最好的见证人，他用亲身经历，向我们讲说了草原的昨天和今天。他告诉我们，蒙古在革命以前，草原被封建统治者霸占着，牧民们没有牛羊。革命胜利后，牧民成为草原的主人了，这块大草原上放牧着千万头牛羊。农场建立以后，又出现了新的景象。两年前，这里只有流动着的蒙古包，现在，农场修建了办公室，学校、医务所和一部分宿舍，工人们在草原上定居下来了。现在这里是一片片的房屋，一缕缕的炊烟，呈现着一派繁荣的新气象。
    农场是在一面生产、一面建设，从无到有逐步发展起来的。当我们进一步参观了农场工人辛勤劳动的果实以后，对于草原的深刻变化，更加给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    随着普尔布场长，我们来到了南面的一个山头上。居高临下，农场种植的八千多公顷耕地，尽在眼底。土地是用机器耕种的，每一块是四百公顷，远远望去，一块连着一块，很整齐。田地里的麦子一片金黄，和周围的绿色草原相互辉映，越发壮丽。
    农场共有六万多公顷面积的土地，可耕地达三万多公顷，浩浩瀚瀚，看不到边。去年，这里只播种了三千多公顷，今年翻了一番还多，根据农场的三年计划，到1960年要发展到两万一千公顷。
    在农场西边，阿尔浑河水蜿蜒流过。这是蒙古较大的河流之一，河两岸，耸立着密密丛丛的绿树。河水流过这块沃土的边沿，绿树把草原风光点缀得更加漂亮。
    和我们一同参观的人，十分赞赏农场的所在，场长也向我们介绍了它的建设远景。
    他说，在中国援助蒙古的建设项目中，有一项是水利工程。蒙古党和政府把这个重点建设项目确定在哈拉和林。他指着远处的阿尔浑河说，决定在这里修一个系统的渠道灌溉工程，利用河水灌溉土地。河水要往高处引，这是一项比较艰巨的工程。现在，中国工程技术人员已经来到这里，正进行勘测工作。据初步估计，渠道修成，将使农场的八千公顷耕地得到灌溉。到那时，产量就要进一步提高。
    普尔布是一位有经验的老场长，但是哈拉和林农场却是蒙古二十一个农牧场中年青的一个。他说，这是蒙古的第一个水利灌溉工程，蒙古政府决定修在这个年青的农场里，农场职工真高兴，他们都以能首先利用阿尔浑河水灌溉农田而感到欢欣鼓舞，决心要把生产搞得更加出色。
    走下山来，我们去到农场的生产队参观。
    农场分作三个生产队，现正进行秋收工作。几十部联合收割机十分忙碌地在地里收麦。
    地里种的是燕麦和小麦。我们先去燕麦地再去小麦地。燕麦和小麦都长得很好，我们站在麦地里比一比，麦子高齐人肩。麦粒饱满，穗子沉沉下坠。
    去年，农场每公顷平均收麦七公担，得到全国麦子的丰产奖。今年，据已收割的八百公顷麦子看来，产量将超过去年，最高产量每公顷达二十公担，比去年全国的最高产量还多五公担。场长很有信心地说，今年的平均产量，估计达到国家三年计划（到1960年）规定的每公顷平均产九公担的指标是有把握的。
    在一块晒麦场上，金色的麦粒堆成一个个小丘，女工们正在翻场。另一边，卡车不断地运麦子来，几个年青人忙着卸麦。他们的劲头十足，一问，才知道是从省里来的中学生，来这里参加劳动，帮助秋收。每年在秋收季节，总有上千的大、中学生到各个农牧场、合作社去帮助收割，许多在牧区长大的青年人，逐渐地熟悉农业生产的技术了。
    在一架收割机旁，我们看到一个年青的学生正在和工人们一块吃午餐。我们问他学会开机器了吗？他有些腼腆，说是在学作助手。
    场长一旁告诉我们，现在农场的拖拉机手们，大都是在场子新建时招收来的牧民青年，他们只经过短期训练，在工作中逐步地熟悉机器性能，很快就能操纵机器了。
    我们乘车在无际的麦田边沿巡回参观，整整一个多小时，只是参观了农场的一角。
    回到招待所吃午饭时，我们不仅尝到农场的肥羊肉，还吃到草原上栽培出来的新鲜黄瓜。场长说，渠道修好，农场还要建个面粉厂，以后，还要请客人吃自己磨出来的面粉哩。
