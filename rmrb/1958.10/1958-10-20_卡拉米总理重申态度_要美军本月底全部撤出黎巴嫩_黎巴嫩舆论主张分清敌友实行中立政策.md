Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 19th: Lebanese Prime Minister Karami told a reporter from "Al Anwar" yesterday, "What we hope for now is that American troops will withdraw completely from our country before the end of this month, so that we can carry out construction and strengthen Lebanese unity."

He pointed out that many people were sacrificed during the people's uprising, but the benefits that the Lebanese people have gained from this uprising are inestimable.

He also said that the recent artificial crisis in Beirut was created by reactionaries, but they have been defeated by the awakened Lebanese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 19th: Lebanese public opinion, while expressing satisfaction with Karami's formation of the new government, continues to demand that U.S. troops get out quickly in order to achieve national reconciliation.

"Al Telegraph" wrote in its congratulatory message to the new government that the primary condition for national reconciliation is the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon. It also emphasized that in order to achieve this goal, it is also necessary to truly implement a neutral policy in relations with other countries and in relations with international groups and military treaties. It believes that it is necessary to establish friendship with all countries, especially with countries that protect small and weak nations, and to strengthen friendship with fraternal Arab countries. The newspaper pointed out that in order to achieve national reconciliation, it is necessary to stipulate the elimination of anarchy, the restoration of the economy and commerce, the guarantee of education for young people, the granting of democratic freedom, and the establishment of equal relations among the Lebanese people.

"Beirut Al Massa" believes that Lebanon must recognize friends and foes in its foreign relations. It pointed out, "Whoever supports our struggle is our friend, and whoever plots against us is our enemy." The newspaper emphasized that "America today is our enemy because it infringes on Lebanese sovereignty and stands with France in Algeria against us."

"Al Kifah" revealed that Chamoun has decided to rely on the armed thugs of the reactionary National Socialist Party to fight against the new government. National Socialist Party leader Ashkar is dissatisfied with the new government because he failed to squeeze into the cabinet.

It is reported that President Chehab has warned Ashkar to stop his party members from engaging in provocative activities and to hand over weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Beirut News: Under the pressure of world opinion and the Lebanese people and the new government, the U.S. aggressor troops are forced to continue their withdrawal from Lebanon. The Lebanese government demands that U.S. troops withdraw completely before the end of October.

The headquarters of the invading U.S. forces announced yesterday that the U.S. military withdrawal is "entering its final stage." In the twenty-four hours prior to that, eight ships full of personnel and supplies had left the port of Beirut. It was announced that the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Marine Regiment of the U.S. forces invading Lebanon and a landing team boarded ships and left the port of Beirut on the morning of the 18th. The day before, about 2,000 army support personnel left Beirut for West Germany on transport ships.

According to United Press International, U.S. President Eisenhower took the opportunity to whitewash the U.S. crime of invading Lebanon. In a special message to the U.S. troops invading Lebanon in Denver, USA, on the 18th, he described the U.S.'s forced withdrawal from Lebanon as "proof that the United States has no aggressive ambitions."

    卡拉米总理重申态度
    要美军本月底全部撤出黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩舆论主张分清敌友实行中立政策
    新华社大马士革19日电　黎巴嫩总理卡拉米昨天对“光明报”记者说，“我们现在所希望的是，要美国军队在本月底以前全部撤出我国，以便我们进行建设和加强黎巴嫩的团结”。
    他指出，在人民起义期间，牺牲的人很多，但是，黎巴嫩人民从这次起义所得到的利益是无法估计的。
    他还说，最近在贝鲁特发生的人为的危机是反动分子制造的，但是，他们已经被觉醒的黎巴嫩人民击败了。
    新华社贝鲁特19日电　黎巴嫩舆论一方面对卡拉米组成新政府一事表示满意，另一方面继续要求美军赶快滚蛋，以便达到全国和解。
    “电讯报”在向新政府致贺时写道，全国和解的首要条件就是美军撤出黎巴嫩。它还强调指出，为了达到这个目的，还必须在同其它国家的关系上以及同国际集团和军事条约的关系上真正实行中立政策。它认为，要同一切国家、首先是同保护弱小民族的国家建立友谊，加强同兄弟阿拉伯国家的友谊。报纸指出，要全国和解，必须规定消灭无政府状态，恢复经济和商业，保证青年受到教育，给予民主自由，并且在黎巴嫩人之间建立平等关系。
    “贝鲁特晚报”认为黎巴嫩在对外关系上必须认清敌友。它指出，“凡是支持我们斗争的人就是我们的朋友，策划阴谋反对我们的就是我们的敌人。”报纸强调指出，“美国今天就是我们的敌人，因为它侵犯黎巴嫩的主权，并且在阿尔及利亚同法国站在一起反对我们”。
    “斗争报”揭露，夏蒙决定依靠反动的国家社会党的武装党徒同新政府抗争。国家社会党党魁阿什卡尔由于未能挤入内阁而对新政府不满。
    据报道，谢哈布总统已经向阿什卡尔提出警告，要他的党徒停止挑衅活动，并且交出武器。
    新华社19日讯　贝鲁特消息：在世界舆论以及黎巴嫩人民和新政府的压力下，美国侵略军被迫继续撤出黎巴嫩。黎巴嫩政府要求美军在10月底前完全撤出。
    侵黎美军总部昨天宣布，目前美军的撤退工作“正进入最后阶段”。在那以前的二十四小时中，已有八艘满载人员和物资的船只驶离贝鲁特港口。据宣布，侵入黎巴嫩的美国第六海军陆战队第二营和一个团登陆队在18日上午乘船离开贝鲁特港。在这之前一天，约有两千名陆军支援人员乘运输舰离开贝鲁特前往西德。
    据合众国际社报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔乘机为美国侵略黎巴嫩的罪行进行洗刷。他18日在美国丹佛向侵黎美军发表的一篇特别文告中，把美国被迫从黎巴嫩撤军说成是“证明美国没有侵略野心”。
