　　Who Exactly is the Layman?

　　The "competition" at Chengdu Institute of Technology powerfully proves that the Party is an expert in leading science. Logically speaking, that professor at the Institute of Technology, having engaged in the chemical industry for a decade or two, should be considered an "expert" in this field; but once the Party organization competed with him, he couldn't help but be considered a "layman." Why would an expert become a "layman," while the Party becomes an "expert"? The reason is that the Party possesses Marxism, this all-powerful key, and can therefore delve into all scientific departments, exploring their secrets. Moreover, the Party most respects scientific laws and can mobilize the masses, relying on the power of the masses to fully grasp scientific laws, thereby finding ways to transform nature and transform society. Under the leadership of such a Party, what scientific fortress cannot be conquered! As for these experts? Although they possess some book knowledge and also have some practical experience, their minds are filled with bourgeois individualism, pursuing fame and profit, being selfish and self-serving, naturally they can only fail in the face of true science.

　　The truth is: Party leadership, coupled with mass movements, no matter what is done, it will always be one victory after another.

    究竟谁是外行
    成都工学院的“竞赛”，有力地证明，党是领导科学的内行。照理说，工学院那位教授搞了一、二十年化学工业，对于此道该算是个“内行”吧；而党组织一和他较量，他就不能不算是个“外行”了。为什么专家会成“外行”，而党却成为“内行”呢？原来，党有着马克思主义这把万能的钥匙，所以就能深入一切科学部门，探索其中的秘密。并且党最尊重科学规律，又能发动群众，依靠群众力量来充分掌握科学规律，从而找出改造自然和改造社会的途径。在这样的党的领导下，还有什么科学堡垒不能攻破呢！这些专家呢？虽然他们有些书本知识，也还有点实际经验，但是脑子里却有着资产阶级个人主义，为名为利，自私自利，自然只能在真正的科学面前失败。
    真理是：党的领导，加上群众运动，无论作什么事，总是一个胜利接着一个胜利。
