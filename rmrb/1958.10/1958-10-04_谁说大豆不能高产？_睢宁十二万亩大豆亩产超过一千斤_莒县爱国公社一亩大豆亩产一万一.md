Who Says Soybeans Can't Have High Yields?
    Suining's 120,000 Mu of Soybeans Yield Over 1,000 Jin Per Mu
    Juxian's Aiguo Commune's One Mu of Soybeans Yields 11,000 Jin

    Xinhua News Agency Report: In Jiangsu Province, Suining County's 120,000 mu of spring soybeans averaged 1,069 jin per mu, an increase of more than seven times over last year's 126 jin per mu.

    Among the twenty-five townships planting spring soybeans, sixteen yielded over 1,000 jin per mu, while the remaining townships yielded between 800 and 900 jin per mu.

    In terms of cultivation techniques and field management, there are three main experiences: First, spring soybeans are dibbled after spring corn seedlings emerge. Tall corn stalks and short bean plants complement each other, providing mutual assistance. The soybean plants cover the ground within the rows of spring corn, helping to retain moisture and preventing evaporation. With corn stalks nearby for support, the bean vines climb the corn stalks, utilizing space to grow upwards, resulting in fewer fallen flowers and more pods. Soybeans prefer shade in the early stages, and their growth is not affected by the corn plants. By the time they need ample sunlight, the corn has matured and been harvested, posing no impact on the soybeans. Intercropping soybeans and corn not only benefits the corn but also completely improves the growing environment for the soybeans. Second, in terms of field management, in addition to deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, multiple harrowings and hoeings, and complete ridging, an important experience is to fully supply water according to the needs of soybean growth. Third, apply ample base fertilizer and topdressing. Fertilization focuses on three key stages, namely seedling fertilizer (to ensure uniform and vigorous seedlings), stalk fertilizer (to promote sturdy stalks), and ear fertilizer (to encourage abundant pod formation), thereby guaranteeing the growth and fruiting of spring soybeans.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd: Zhang Fangcheng, leader of the 11th production team of the 2nd brigade of the Aiguo People's Commune in Juxian County, Shandong Province, and two others cultivated one mu of spring soybeans, which, after being inspected by Wang Xingfu of the County Party Committee's resident commune work team, Zhang Lianji, secretary of the brigade's general branch, and three others, yielded an actual output of 11,700 jin.

    This "satellite field" was originally relatively fertile plain land. This spring, a levee was built to divert the Luo River. Ninety thousand jin of fertilizer were applied, and 18,000 mounds were planted after digging holes. The seeds were Xinong No. 18. During the growing period, the field was hoed and weeded three times, topdressed twice, and insecticides were applied multiple times. Soybean plants generally reached a height of two Chinese feet, with the tallest reaching two and a half feet. The stalks were as thick as thumbs, and each plant bore as many as 840 bean pods, with the fewest bearing over 400.

    谁说大豆不能高产？
    睢宁十二万亩大豆亩产超过一千斤
    莒县爱国公社一亩大豆亩产一万一
    本报讯　江苏省睢宁县十二万亩春大豆平均亩产一千零六十九斤，比去年亩产一百二十六斤增产了七倍以上。
    在二十五个种植春大豆的乡内，千斤乡有十六个，其余的乡亩产都是八百斤到九百斤。
    在栽培技术和田间管理上，主要有三条经验：一、在春玉米出苗之后，开始点播春大豆。玉米秆高，豆子矮，高矮搭配，互相起了帮助作用。春玉米行内有了大豆复盖地面，可以保墒，水分不易蒸发；大豆旁边有了玉米做依靠，豆藤爬在玉米秆上，利用空间向上生长，落花很少，结荚较多。大豆前期喜阴，在玉米棵中并不影响生长，到需要充分阳光期，玉米已经成熟收割，对大豆毫无影响。大豆和玉米间作，不但对玉米有利，也使大豆生长环境完全有了改善。二、在田间管理上，除了深耕细作，多耙多锄，全部畦田化以外，重要的一条经验是，按照大豆生长的需要，充分供给水分。三、多施基肥和追肥。施肥抓住三个环节，即苗肥（苗齐苗旺）、秆肥（秆子粗壮）和穗肥（多结荚子），因而保证了春大豆的生长和结实。
    新华社济南3日电　山东省莒县爱国人民公社二大队十一生产队队长张方成等三人培植的一亩春大豆，经县委驻社工作组王兴福、大队总支书记张连济等五人验收，实产一万一千七百斤。
    这亩“卫星田”原是比较肥沃的平原地，今春筑成了引洛河河堤，施肥九万斤，挖穴后用水点种一万八千墩，种籽是新农十八号，在生长期间锄耪三次，追肥两次，除虫多次。大豆一般棵高二市尺，最高的二尺五寸，秸粗像大拇指，每株结豆荚多的有八百四十个，少者也在四百个以上。
