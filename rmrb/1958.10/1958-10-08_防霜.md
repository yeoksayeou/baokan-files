Zhao Dabo had just picked up his rice bowl and taken the first bite. The head of the commune rushed in, breathless, and said, "The county called to notify us that there will be a heavy frost tomorrow morning, and we need to prepare for prevention." Before the words had finished, he was running off to notify others.

Zhao Dabo felt like he had been burned, abruptly put down his rice bowl, grabbed his cotton-padded coat from the head of the bed, threw it on, picked up his lantern, and rushed out the door towards the vegetable garden in the west of the village. ...

"Old man, finish eating before you go, the food will get cold..." Zhao Da Niang chased him to the door, shouting loudly at his back.

Zhao Dabo was only thinking about the commune head's words and the vegetables in the garden, not hearing what Da Niang was shouting at all, wishing he could sprout wings and fly into the vegetable garden.

This was the largest vegetable plot nearby, supplying vegetables to a mining area and some city residents. Everyone was working hard day and night, leaping forward to support the liberation of Taiwan, and we absolutely couldn't let comrades lack vegetables and affect their health... Thinking of this, Dabo threw off the cotton-padded coat he was wearing, put down the lantern, ran to the base of the well, and carried bundles of the piled-up dead branches and weeds to the perimeter of the vegetable field.

"Dabo, why didn't you call someone?" Assistant Xiao Wang, panting, ran up to Dabo, pouting and saying, "If the commune head hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known."

"Hey, how could I have spared the time? Let's get to work." Saying that, the two of them started to work, one carrying and the other carrying on their backs.

The dead grass under the well was all carried away, but there were still more than twenty loads short.

"What should we do?" Xiao Wang looked at Dabo with difficulty.

"Go back and get more." Dabo waved his arm and ran towards the village. Xiao Wang followed closely behind. As they entered the village, a gust of cold wind blew, choking them and making it hard to breathe, and the air suddenly became piercingly cold. Zhao Dabo and Xiao Wang resolutely carried two loads of wheat straw and flew to the vegetable garden.

"Quick, light the fire!" Zhao Dabo shouted to Xiao Wang, and the two of them ran to the piles of straw at both ends of the field respectively.

Immediately, dozens of large fires blazed fiercely, and billowing smoke spread out. Under the sunlight, it truly looked like a thick layer of cotton wool was covering the vegetable field. ...

    防霜
    红茵
    赵大伯刚端起饭碗，吃了头一口。社长气喘吁吁的跑进来，说：“县里来电话通知，明天晨有大霜降临，要我们做好防御工作。”话没落音，又跑着通知其他人去了。
    赵大伯像火烧了一下，猛的放下饭碗，抓起炕头棉袄，披在身上，提了马灯，冲出门，向村西菜园跑去。……
    “老东西，吃完再去吧，饭要凉……”赵大娘追出门来，朝着他的背影，大声喊着。
    赵大伯只顾想着社长的话和园子里的菜，根本没有听见大娘喊了些什么，恨不得插上翅膀，一下飞进菜园去。
    这是附近最大的一处菜地，供应着一个矿区和部分市民蔬菜的需要。大家都在夜以继日的苦战、跃进，支援解放台湾，绝不能让同志们缺少菜吃，影响了身体的健康……想到这里，大伯摔掉身上披的棉袄，放下马灯，跑到井台下面，把那里堆积的枯枝杂草，一捆捆扛到菜地周围去。
    “大伯，怎么不叫人家一声？”助手小王，喘呼呼的跑到大伯跟前，噘着嘴说：“不是社长告诉我，还不知道呢。”
    “嗨，哪能顾得上呢，干吧。”说着，两个人你扛我背的干了起来。
    井台下面的枯草，全运完了，还差二十多担。
    “怎么办？”小王为难的看着大伯。
    “回去拿。”大伯一挥胳膊，向村里跑去。小王紧紧跟在后面。刚进村，一股冷风吹过，呛得喘不过气来，空气骤然变得刺骨样寒冷。赵大伯和小王结结实实挑了两担麦秸飞向菜园里来。
    “快点火！”赵大伯向小王喊了一声，两人分别向地两头的草堆跑去。
    顿时，几十堆大火，熊熊燃起，滚滚浓烟，弥散开来，朝阳一照，真像菜地上空，笼罩了一层厚厚的棉絮一般。……
