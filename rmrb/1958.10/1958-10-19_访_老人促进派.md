Visiting the "Old People's Promotion Faction"
By Our Reporters Wang Lichen and Li Qilong

　　Old man Cheng Yang rivals Huang Zhong,
　　A pioneer in every kind of production,
　　The later he works the more energetic he gets,
　　The older the watermelon, the redder the heart.

This is a Dong folk song circulating in Chengyang, Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi. It was this summer when the commune was engaged in crash harvesting and planting. For forty days, dozens of old people, like the young people, ate in the fields, lived in sheds, and worked hard day and night. When the young men advised these old people to rest more, a 54-year-old Wu Jiasheng sang this song to express the feelings of the old people. Here, more than 80 old people have been respectfully called the "Old People's Promotion Faction."

After liberation, Wu Jiasheng wrote and sang many socialist Dong folk songs, and is now called a "Socialist Singer." He once led all the men and women in the village with Party Branch Secretary Shi Mingde, attacking the "Carp Slope," a feng shui site, with hoes and shovels, breaking superstitions. When we asked how the old people in Chengyang used to be deeply superstitious about feng shui, but now they don't believe it at all, he smiled and said: "Bodhisattvas are useless, they are liars. In the past, talking about superstition, we were still poor, still suffering. With the leadership of the Communist Party, every household now has a good life. We old people thought it through in the great debate. So, when the Party branch issued the call to move mountains and reclaim wasteland, I thought: Saying is saying, but to really do it, you need someone to take the lead, so I followed the Party branch secretary to open up the feng shui slope. When the young people saw the old people on the front lines, they all rushed to the slope to work. Now, this superstitious slope is a fertile field."

Speaking of 63-year-old Yang Chengpeng, his energy is even more boundless. One night, we met him and heard a very interesting story about winning the red flag: During the rice transplanting season, the commune launched a red flag competition, stipulating that the team whose members went to work together early would get the red flag. Yang Chengpeng said to the team leader: "We must compete with the youth team! I am old and sleep less, give me the task of winning the red flag." The captain agreed. The first night, as soon as the rooster crowed, he woke up the commune members sleeping in the shed and went to the shed where the commune cadres lived to get the red flag. On the way, he met the young men from the youth team already carrying the red flag to work. "Okay! Young men, we'll compete again tomorrow!" He greeted them and went to work. He worked all day, and when he returned to the shed at night, everyone was sleepy. He sat and smoked, and then lay down to rest, thinking about winning the red flag, and couldn't fall asleep. It started raining in the middle of the night, but he didn't care about the cold and woke up the commune members to carry the red flag. In this way, he didn't sleep for three nights in a row, and worked as usual during the day, winning the red flag three times in a row for the team, greatly boosting the team's morale, and the team's production was very outstanding. Now, this old man and Yang Chengrong, Yang Junhua, Yang Tonghuai, and other nine old men are jointly responsible for managing one mu of "late rice old people's satellite field." Early in the morning, before the sun comes out, they go to the satellite field to gently remove the dew from the rice seedlings, and apply various fertilizers every day. They plan to produce 150,000 jin per mu and go to Beijing with the young men at the end of the year to report the good news.

The old people of Chengyang are indeed "pioneers in every kind of production." When building water conservancy projects, 88-year-old Wu Guoan, who had not left his house for ten years, personally went to work to guide the young people in building the canals while leaning on his crutches. Old man Wu Chengshan has not rested for half a day from the Spring Festival until now. During the spring water conservancy construction, there was a heavy snow of four or five inches thick, and he and the captain insisted on repairing the canal. The commune's pig farm also has eight old men and women responsible for raising eighty pigs. Every day, they go to the mountains to cut 400 jin of pig feed, pick up 700 jin of firewood, and cook 24 pots of pig food. These eight old people are led by 72-year-old Shi Hanyao.

These old people's promotion factions have displayed soaring energy in the Great Leap Forward and have been respected by everyone. Inspired by them, the young people are even more like lively dragons and tigers fighting in the fields. (Attached picture)

    访“老人促进派”
    本报记者　王立忱　李起龙
    程阳老人赛黄忠，
    门门生产打先锋，
    越干深夜越有劲，
    西瓜越老心越红。
    这是流传在广西三江侗族自治县程阳地方的一首侗歌。那还是今年夏天，社里进行抢收抢插，整整四十天，几十位老人和青年人一样吃在田头，住在工棚，日夜苦战。小伙子们劝这些老人多休息一会，一位五十四岁的吴家盛便唱出了这首歌来表达老人的心情。在这里，已有八十多位老人被人们尊称为“老人促进派”。
    吴家盛老人在解放后，编唱了许多社会主义的侗歌，现在被人叫做“社会主义歌手”。他曾经和党支部书记石明德一起带领全寨男女，拱锄向风水地“鲤鱼坡”开火，破除了迷信。当我们问起程阳的老人过去迷信风水很深，现在怎么都不信了？他笑着说：菩萨不顶事，是骗人的。过去讲迷信，穷还是穷，苦还是苦。有了共产党的领导，现在家家户户生活好，我们老人在大辩论里就想清楚了，所以，党支部一号召开山动土垦荒地，我就想：说是说，要真正干还得有带头的人，我就跟着党支部书记一起去开风水坡。年青人一看老人都上了阵，全拥到坡上干起来。现在，这个迷信坡已是一片良田。
    提起六十三岁的杨成朋更是干劲冲天。有天夜里，我们见到了他，听了一个十分有趣的夺红旗的故事：还是插秧时候，社里开展了红旗竞赛，规定那个队社员出工齐出工早就得红旗。杨成朋向队长说：“咱们一定要和青年队比一比！我年纪大、瞌睡少，夺红旗的任务给我吧。”队长答应了。第一天夜里，鸡才叫头遍，他就叫醒睡在工棚里的社员一起到社干部住的工棚里去拿红旗。走到半路，碰见青年队的小伙子们已经扛上红旗出工了。“好吧！小伙子们，明天再较量！”他打了个招呼就出工了，这天干了一天活，夜晚回到工棚，大家都困了。他一会坐着抽抽烟，一会躺着休息一下，一心想夺红旗，怎么也睡不着觉，半夜下起雨来也不顾冷，叫醒社员去扛红旗。就这样，他一连三个夜晚不睡觉，白天照常干活，为队里连夺三次红旗，大大鼓舞了队里的士气，队里生产搞得很出色。现在，这位老人还和杨成荣、杨俊华、杨通怀等九位老大爷共同负责看管一亩“晚稻老人卫星田”。清晨，太阳还没有出来，他们就到卫星田里轻轻拨掉禾苗上的露水，天天施放各种肥水，他们计划亩产十五万斤，年底和青年小伙子一道进北京城报喜。
    程阳的老人，的确是“门门生产打先锋”。修水利时，八十八岁的老公公吴国安，已经十年不出门了，在兴修水利时，拄了拐棍亲自出工指导青年人砌水渠。吴成善老人从春节到现在，没有休息过半天。春天修水利时落了四、五寸厚的大雪，他和队长坚持把渠修好。社里的养猪场还有八个男女老人，负责饲养八十头猪。他们每天到山上去割四百斤猪菜，还要拾七百斤柴，再煮二十四锅猪食。这八个老人由七十二岁的石汉尧老汉带头。
    这些老人促进派在大跃进中发挥冲天干劲，受到了大家的敬爱。青年人在他们的激励下，更像生龙活虎战斗在田间。（附图片）
