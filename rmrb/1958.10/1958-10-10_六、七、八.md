Six, seven, eight-year-old children, plant rice superbly; if you don't believe it, let the facts answer.
The children of workers at the State-owned Farm in Yicheng County, Hubei Province—six-year-old Xiang Jinlin, seven-year-old Wu Chenggong, and eight-year-old Zheng Jinlian—jointly cultivated a paddy rice experimental plot. It sounds like a myth.
On April 17th of this year, all Party members, Youth League members, and cadres of the farm held a great leap forward rally. These three children, who usually played together, also sneaked into the meeting and squeezed around. The atmosphere at the meeting was unusual, attracting the children. People solemnly swore to Chairman Mao: to take the lead in cultivating experimental plots well, strive for a yield of two thousand catties per mu for the entire farm's rice, and strive to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao! What was the experimental plot about? The children didn't quite understand, but they knew that anything sworn to Chairman Mao must be a good thing.
"We also want to plant experimental plots! We also want to see Chairman Mao!" Wu Chenggong pulled Zheng Jinlian to the front of the podium and saluted the portrait of Chairman Mao.
After the meeting, the cadres' experimental plots were established, and Wu Chenggong's father was also busy planting experimental plots every day. One day, Wu Chenggong said to Zheng Jinlian and Xiang Jinlin, "We saluted Chairman Mao, so we should learn from our fathers and plant experimental plots!" The next day, Wu Chenggong's mother looked everywhere for the iron shovel she needed, searching and searching, and finally found it in the open space, where Wu Chenggong was digging the ground! He was scolded by his mother, and the iron shovel was taken away. The three of them stood there for a while and decided to find another way. Later, they found a broken iron spade and continued digging, digging a whole square meter, filled it with water, and prepared to transplant the seedlings.
The children didn't know where they got a few bundles of seedlings, and they planted them in a serious manner. At this time, the farm's technician, Old Ruan, passed by, and Wu Chenggong saw him and shouted, "Uncle, it's good that we are planting an experimental plot!" "Why do you want to plant an experimental plot?" Old Ruan asked curiously. "Dad and the uncles are planting, why shouldn't we plant?" Wu Chenggong replied.
Yes! How profound is the influence of adults' every move on children! Old Ruan sighed, and was about to leave when he was stopped by Wu Chenggong, who said, "Uncle, can you find us a good field?" "It would be good to give you a good field, but you can't plant it," Old Ruan replied carelessly. Who knew that the children were very happy to hear this, and they immediately put down the seedlings in their hands, and the three of them grabbed Old Ruan's sleeves, and three pairs of eyes looked at him pleadingly. One said, "We saluted Chairman Mao." Another said, "Give us a good field!" Another said, "We won't let you go if you don't agree."
Old Ruan thought: This time, it's for real. To be honest, he was already moved by the children's adult-like determination. "I'll give you that two-fen plot by the road!" Old Ruan decided, but he still added worriedly, "But can you handle it?" "We can handle it, we'll do it every day," Wu Chenggong replied firmly.
"We have an experimental plot too!" Wu Chenggong told his mother as soon as he entered the house. His mother said, "Nonsense, don't go playing with mud every day, and give me trouble!" In front of his mother, the child didn't retort, nor did he yield. They decided to start work immediately, and also learn from the adults and form an experimental group, and elect a group leader. Wu Chenggong was elected at the group meeting, and he said to everyone, "You have to listen to me when I tell you to do something!"
No sooner said than done, but after digging for half a day, only a small corner of the two-fen plot was dug. The children began to get anxious; everyone else is transplanting seedlings, when will we be able to transplant seedlings? At this time, the Youth League Secretary, Ding Xihong, came, and Wu Chenggong requested, "Uncle Ding, help us plow it!" Old Ding plowed it for them.
The field was plowed, but how to transplant the seedlings? The children asked for seedlings everywhere, a few bundles here, a few bundles there, and they gathered a lot. How to plant them? They heard that 1×5 cun was the best, but what did 1×5 cun look like? Coincidentally, the farm organized a visit to transplanting seedlings, and the children followed to watch, and when they came back, they transplanted the seedlings according to the 1×5 cun specifications, not only transplanting them neatly, but also transplanting them quickly, Zheng Jinlian could plant two seedlings with one hand!
After transplanting the seedlings, the children learned everything the adults did, topdressing, weeding, and irrigating, nothing was left behind. If they didn't have fertilizer, they carried small manure baskets and collected manure everywhere; if they didn't have rakes for weeding, they grabbed it with their hands; if they didn't know how to use the waterwheel for irrigation, they used washbasins to fetch water from the ditch.
In July, the rice ripened, and the children harvested it with small sickles. On the day of threshing, the county magistrate, the director of the agricultural bureau, the director of the women's federation, and the cadres of the farm all came to participate in the acceptance. The total yield of these two-fen of land was one thousand two hundred and fifty catties and twelve taels. In the cheers, the children jumped and sang:
    Chairman Mao, like the sun,
    Shines wherever it shines!
Two fen of land produced one thousand two hundred and fifty catties and twelve taels, which is equivalent to more than six thousand two hundred and fifty-three catties per mu, which is more than twice the average yield of two thousand and eighty-seven catties per mu for the entire farm. Isn't it a miracle! Isn't it a red flag! Isn't it a small person doing great things! At the farm's celebration of the harvest, the children were rewarded, and each person's prize was: a set of new clothes.
The first time they planted an experimental plot, they achieved a great harvest, which was a great encouragement to the children, and they became more and more enthusiastic. One day, on the millstone in the open space, another group meeting was held to discuss the planting of late rice. A plan was made, and a wooden sign was inserted at the head of the field:
    Heroes emerge from youth, children engage in experiments;
    Rice two fen of land, total output reaches two thousand.
It was time to transplant the late rice seedlings, and the seedlings distributed to the children by the production team were yellow and thin, so the children asked the technician, Old Ruan, for some good seedlings. In order to strive for a total output of over two thousand catties for the late rice, the children guarded the fields every day, and if they didn't have any work to do, they stood guard.
On September 1st, Comrade Wang Yanchun, the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, came to this farm and visited the children's experimental plot. Sure enough, three children with bare backs were drawing water to irrigate the fields, and the rice in the fields was lush and dense, so beautiful that it was indescribable, and no other plot around could compare.
Comrade Wang Yanchun said to the children: "You have learned from the adults and surpassed the adults, and now the adults must learn from you!"
Indeed, the children's experimental plot has become the first field for late rice on the entire farm and a model for the entire farm to learn from. In strengthening the later management of late rice, the farm put forward a resounding slogan: all late rice must learn from "Six, Seven, Eight"! The name "Six, Seven, Eight" shook the entire farm, and people, upon hearing it, would encourage themselves: we shouldn't lose to the children!

    六、七、八

    六、七、八岁小娃娃，水稻种得顶呱呱；大家要是不相信，就让事实来回答。
    湖北省宜城县国营农场工人的子弟——六岁的向金林、七岁的吴成功和八岁的郑金莲，合伙培育了一块水稻试验田。说起来，好像神话。
    今年4月17日，全场的党团员、干部举行跃进誓师大会。这三个平常总在一起游戏的小孩，也溜进会场，挤来挤去。会场上有一种不平常的气氛，吸引着孩子们。人们严肃地向毛主席宣誓：保证带头种好试验田，争取全场水稻亩产双千斤，争取上北京见毛主席！试验田是怎么回事？孩子们虽然不大明白，但是他们懂得：向毛主席宣誓的事，一定是好事。
    “我们也要种试验田！我们也要见毛主席！”吴成功拉着郑金莲挤到讲台前，向毛主席像行个礼。
    会后，干部的试验田建立起来了，吴成功的爸爸也天天忙着种试验田。一天，吴成功对郑金莲和向金林说：“我们向毛主席行过礼了，应该学爸爸种试验田呀！”第二天，吴成功的妈妈到处找不见要用的铁锨，找呀找呀，终于在空场里找到了，吴成功正在那儿挖地呢！他被妈妈骂了一顿，铁锨也被拿去了。三个人在那儿呆了一下，决定另找门路。后来，他们找到一支坏铁铲，又继续挖了起来，整整挖了一平方公尺大的一块，灌上水，就准备插秧了。
    孩子们不知道从哪儿弄来了几束秧，就正正经经地插起来。这时，场里技术员老阮从这里走过，吴成功看见了就喊道：“叔叔，我们种试验田好吧！”“你们为什么要种试验田呀！”老阮好奇地问。“爸爸和叔叔们都在种，我们为啥不种。”吴成功这样回答。
    是呀！大人们的一举一动对孩子是有多么深刻的影响啊！老阮感慨着，正想走，又被吴成功喊住了，说：“叔叔给我们找一块好田行吗？”“给你们一块好是好，就是你们种不了。”老阮不在意地回答。谁知道，孩子们一听可高兴了，他们立即放下手上的秧，三个人都拉着老阮的衣角，三双眼睛都用恳求的眼光望着他。这个说：“我们向毛主席行过礼了。”那个说：“给我们一块好田吧！”另一个又说：“不答应就不让你走。”
    老阮想：这回可是弄假成真了。老实说，他已经被孩子们这种大人般的决心感动了。“给你们大路旁那块两分地吧！”老阮决定了，但还是不放心地接上一句：“可是，你们搞得了吗？”“搞得了，我们天天搞。”吴成功坚决地回答。
    “我们也有试验田了！”吴成功回家一进门就告诉了妈妈。妈妈说：“鬼话，别天天去弄泥巴，给我添麻烦！”在妈妈面前，孩子没有回嘴，也没有屈服。他们决定马上动工，也学大人的样子搞个试验小组，选小组长。小组会上当选的是吴成功，他向大家说：“以后叫你们干啥，可要听话啊！”
    说干就干，但两分地挖了半天，还只是挖了一个小角。孩子们开始发急了；人家都在插秧，我们什么时候才能插秧呢？这时，团支书丁喜洪来了，吴成功就要求道：“丁叔叔，帮我们犁一下吧！”老丁就给犁了。
    田是犁了，要插秧怎么办？孩子们到处要秧，这几束，那几束，凑了不少。怎么插？听说1×5寸最好，可是1×5寸又是什么样的呢？正好农场里组织参观插秧，孩子们也跟着去看，回来，就照1×5寸的规格插起秧来，不但插得整齐，还插得快，郑金莲一手能插两蔸呢！
    插上秧以后，大人们怎么干，孩子们怎么学，追肥、除草、灌水，样样没有落后。没有肥，就背着小粪筐到处捡粪；除草没有耙子，就用手抓；灌水不会用水车，就拿洗脸盆从沟里提水。
    7月间，稻子黄熟了，孩子们拿着小镰刀收割。打场这一天，县里的县长、农业局长、妇联主任和场里的干部都来参加验收。这两分田的总产量是一千二百五十斤十二两。在欢呼声中，孩子们蹦呀跳地唱起来：
    毛主席，像太阳，
    照到哪里哪里亮！
    两分地产一千二百五十斤十二两，折合亩产就是六千二百五十三斤多，这比全场平均亩产二千零八十七斤要多出两倍。岂不是奇迹！岂不是红旗！岂不是小人办大事！在全场庆祝丰收大会上，孩子们受到了奖励，每个人的奖品是：一套新衣裳。
    第一次种试验田就获得了大丰收，这对于孩子们来说，是多么大的鼓舞，他们是越来劲儿越大。有一天，在空场里的磨盘子上，又开小组会，讨论种晚稻的事情。订了规划，就在田头插上一块木牌子：
    英雄出少年，儿童搞试验；
    水稻两分地，总产达两千。
    要插晚稻了，生产队分给孩子们的秧又黄又瘦，孩子们就另找技术员老阮要了一些好秧。孩子们为了争取晚稻总产超两千，天天守在地里，没有活干就站岗放哨。
    9月1日，省委书记王延春同志来到这个农场，参观了孩子们的试验田。可不是，三个光着脊梁的小孩正在那里提水灌田，田里的稻子长得绿沉沉的密麻麻的，好看得没法说，周围哪一块能比得上呢？
    王延春同志对孩子们说：“你们学习了大人们，超过了大人们，现在大人们要向你们学习！”
    的的确确，孩子们的试验田已经成为全场晚稻第一田，成为全场学习的样板。在加强晚稻后期管理中，场里提出了一个响亮的口号：所有的晚稻都要向“六、七、八”看齐！“六、七、八”的名字震动全场，人们一听到它，就会勉励自己：总不应当输给娃娃们吧！
