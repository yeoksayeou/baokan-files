    Many People Accomplish Great Things
    Anhui Dingyuan　Du Shushan
    A boat without a rudder is hard to steer,
    A small commune with few people struggles,
    Industry and agriculture develop greatly,
    Busy day and night without rest,
    Establish the People's Commune,
    Everyone's beating drums and gongs.
    Lay the foundation and take root,
    Have the capital to develop production,
    Work hard for a year and reap a great harvest,
    Work hard for two years and transform completely,
    Work hard for three years and change the face of the land,
    Happiness for generations to come!

    人多办大事
    安徽定远　杜守珊
    有桨无舵船难行，
    社小人少事成群，
    工业农业大发展，
    日夜不歇忙不清，
    办起人民大公社，
    敲锣打鼓都有人。
    打下底子扎下根，
    发展生产有了本，
    大干一年大丰收，
    大干二年大翻身，
    大干三年变面貌，
    子孙万代乐无穷！
