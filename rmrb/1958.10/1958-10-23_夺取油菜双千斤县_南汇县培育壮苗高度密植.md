Strive for a Double Thousand Jin County for Rapeseed
Nanhui County Cultivates Strong Seedlings with High-Density Planting

(Our report) The people of Nanhui County, a famous high-yield rapeseed county in China, are determined to raise the red flag of the great leap forward in rapeseed production even higher, and strive to become a double thousand jin county for rapeseed next year. At present, the 17,000 mu of rapeseed seedling nurseries in Nanhui County have generally grown four or five true leaves, and the taproots are very strong.

Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, plans to plant 70,000 mu this year, more than double that of last year. This year's rapeseed autumn sowing work has drawn on the experience of high-yield rapeseed and started earlier. In the past, rapeseed sowing here generally started in early October, and transplanting to the fields could be as late as late December. This year, the county generally finished sowing rapeseed before September 20, and it is expected that transplanting will be completed in most areas before the end of October.

Cultivating strong seedlings is a major experience from the 1958 rapeseed bumper harvest. This year, all the seeds planted are Victory Rapeseed, generally using about 1.5 jin per mu. At the same time, a large number of reserve seedlings were interplanted in green manure fields. All localities are creating more seedling beds and selecting large and strong seedlings for transplanting. Particular attention is paid to the management of seedlings. The 21 mu of rapeseed that has been transplanted in the Central Commune have all survived, and are currently growing well. The number of plants per mu is between 15,000 and 20,000, which is two to three times higher than last year.

At present, while rushing to plant wheat, all communes in the county are also stepping up the work of deep plowing, leveling the land, and transporting and applying fertilizer to the rapeseed fields. (Yan Gangming)

    夺取油菜双千斤县
    南汇县培育壮苗高度密植
    本报讯我国著名的油菜高产县南汇县人民，决心更高地举起油菜生产大跃进的红旗，争取实现明年油菜双千斤县。现在，南汇县的一万七千亩油菜育苗地，已普遍长出了四、五片真叶，主根很茁壮。
    江苏省南汇县今年栽种面积计划为七万亩，比去年增加一倍多。今年油菜秋播工作吸取了油菜高产的经验，动手较早。往年，这里的油菜下种一般在10月上旬，向大田里移栽能迟到12月下旬。今年全县油菜下种一般在9月20日前结束，预计在10月底前绝大部分地区可以完成移栽工作。
      培育壮苗，是1958年油菜大丰收中一条主要经验。今年全部种的是胜利油菜，一般是每亩下种一斤半左右。同时又在绿肥田里间种了大批预备苗，各地都是多做苗床，选大苗壮苗移栽。对苗的管理特别细致。中心公社已经移栽的二十一亩油菜，都已活棵，目前生长情况良好。每亩棵数均在一万五到两万之间，比去年提高两倍至三倍。
    现在，全县各个公社正在突击抢种三麦的同时，抓紧进行油菜田的深翻、平整土地、运肥施肥等工作。　　　（严钢明）
