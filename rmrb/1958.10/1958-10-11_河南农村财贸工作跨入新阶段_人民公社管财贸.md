Henan's Rural Financial and Trade Work Enters a New Stage
People's Communes Manage Finance and Trade

(Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 10th) According to the new situation of the people's commune system and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the province, Henan Province's financial and trade departments have decided to establish financial and trade work organizations in the people's communes from now on, implementing a new method of "two releases" (releasing personnel, releasing assets), "three unifieds" (unified policies, unified plans, unified management of working capital), and "one contract" (contracting financial revenue) for the people's communes, to fully carry out large-scale purchasing and sales, promote industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate the people's communes. This decision was put forward by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China at a recent financial and economic work conference.

The meeting studied how financial and trade work should keep up with the series of changes in product exchange and distribution caused by the establishment of people's communes and the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. The representatives at the meeting reflected various views of the 300,000 employees on the financial and trade front of the province on issues such as improving the financial and trade system of the people's communes. The majority of financial and trade cadres enthusiastically supported the decision of the Provincial Party Committee. They believed that the benefits of implementing this method are: facilitating the unified leadership of the Party; conducive to the consolidation of the people's communes; unified strength, saving personnel, and simplifying procedures; fully leveraging the enthusiasm of the people's communes in managing financial and trade work; and guaranteeing income. However, some employees still have many confused understandings. For example, the commercial system reflected that cadres have six fears after the commercial institutions are decentralized: fear that funds will be moved and misappropriated, and assets will be difficult to manage; fear that the goods shipped will not be suitable and the people's communes will not want them; fear of not paying for the goods in time; fear of affecting the turnover of commercial working capital; fear of difficulty in handling defective goods; and fear that commercial cadres will be transferred to engage in central work, affecting business development. The grain department's concerns are: first, fear that the county grain bureau will have no power after decentralization; second, fear that cadres familiar with the business will be transferred away; third, fear of inflexible allocation; and fourth, fear of failing to complete the reporting tasks. Some people even doubt whether the merger of the state-owned institutions of the whole people into the collectively owned people's communes is a regression, and whether they will be considered cadres after decentralization and what their future will be.

In response to the above situation, the meeting carried out a large-scale airing of views, a great blooming, and a great debate, so that everyone realized that the people's commune is a comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and an integration of industry, agriculture, military, education, and commerce, and a basic-level state power and social production unit that combines government and commune; the people's commune has great strength and can manage agriculture and industry well, and it will certainly be able to manage financial and trade work well. At the same time, with the financial and trade institutions, personnel, and powers decentralized to the people's communes, the tasks of the state's financial and trade departments are not reduced, but increased. Financial and trade departments should not only do a good job in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, the supply of materials, and financial and monetary work, but also guide the people's communes to develop production and do a good job in the distribution, consumption, and accumulation of products within the communes. In addition, financial and trade work is carried out under the unified leadership, overall consideration, comprehensive planning, and unified arrangement of the Party committee of the people's commune, and it is easier to obtain the support of the masses than in the past. The meeting cited many facts to illustrate this issue. Through debate, everyone also clarified that the decentralization of financial and trade institutions, personnel, and powers to the people's communes is not a regression, because the current collective ownership of the people's communes already contains some elements of ownership by the whole people, and this ownership by the whole people will continue to grow in continuous development and gradually replace collective ownership. After the financial and trade institutions, personnel, and powers are decentralized to the people's communes, they must still obey the state's various plans, obey the state's regulations on market prices, and obey the unified management of cash, which also increases the elements of ownership by the whole people in the people's communes.

The meeting also arranged the financial and trade work for this winter and next spring in accordance with the new situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture in Henan Province.

During this meeting, Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Cheng Zihua, Deputy Director of the Fifth Office of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

### 河南农村财贸工作跨入新阶段  人民公社管财贸

    河南农村财贸工作跨入新阶段
    人民公社管财贸
    本报郑州10日电　河南省财贸部门根据当前全省人民公社化和工农业生产大跃进的新形势，确定从现在起在人民公社建立财贸工作机构，对人民公社实行两放（放人、放资产）三统（政策统一、计划统一、流动资金管理统一）一包（包财政收入）的新办法，全面开展大购大销，促进工农业生产，巩固人民公社。这个决定是中共河南省委在最近召开的财经工作会议上提出的。
    会议研究了在人民公社成立，工农业生产飞速发展，产品交换、分配起了一系列变化的情况下，财贸工作应该如何跟上去的问题。与会代表反映了全省财贸战线三十万职工对改进人民公社的财贸体制等问题的各种不同看法，大多数财贸工作干部热烈拥护省委的决定，他们认为实行这种办法的好处是：便于党的统一领导；有利于人民公社的巩固；力量统一，节约人员，简化手续；可以充分发挥人民公社管理财贸工作的积极性；收入有保证。但也有部分职工还存在着许多糊涂认识。比如，商业系统反映，商业机构下放后干部有六怕：怕资金被移动挪用，财产不好管理；怕货发的不对路，人民公社不要；怕不及时付货款；怕影响商业流动资金周转；怕残次商品不好处理；怕抽商业干部搞中心工作，影响业务开展。粮食部门的顾虑是：一怕下放后县粮食局无权；二怕业务熟悉的干部调走；三怕调拨不灵；四怕报表任务完不成。有的人甚至怀疑全民所有制的国家机构并入集体所有制的人民公社是不是倒退，下放后算不算干部，将来前途如何？
    会议针对上述情况，开展大鸣大放大辩论，使大家认识到人民公社是农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，工、农、兵、学、商互相结合，政社合一的国家基层政权和社会生产单位；人民公社力量大，能办得好农业、工业，也一定能办得好财贸工作。同时，财贸机构、人员和职权下放到人民公社，国家财贸部门的任务不是减轻了，而是加重了，财贸部门不仅要作好农副产品采购、物资供应和财政金融工作，还要指导人民公社发展生产，作好社内产品的分配、消费和积累工作。另外，财贸工作在人民公社党委统一领导、统筹兼顾、全面规划、统一安排下进行，进一步取得人民群众的支持，比过去好作了。会议中列举许多事实说明了这个问题。通过辩论，大家也明确了财贸机构人员和职权下放到人民公社并不是倒退，因为目前人民公社的集体所有制中，已经包含有若干全民所有制的成份，这种全民所有制将在不断发展中继续增长，逐步地代替集体所有制。财贸机构人员和职权下放到人民公社以后，仍然必须服从国家的各项计划，服从国家关于市场价格的规定，服从现金统一管理，这样也正是增加了人民公社的全民所有制成份。
    会议还根据河南省工农业大跃进的新形势，安排了今冬明春的财贸工作。
    在这次会议期间，中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念和国务院第五办公室副主任程子华到会作了重要指示。
