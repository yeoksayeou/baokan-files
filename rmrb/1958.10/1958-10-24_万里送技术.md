    Delivering Technology Across Thousands of Miles
    The Hui and Han farmers in the suburbs of Wuzhong City, who transplanted rice for the first time this year on 993 mu of land, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield per mu reached about 1,200 jin, almost double the yield of locally broadcast rice. When celebrating the bumper harvest, they always remember the ten Hui and Han old farmers who came from far away Tianjin this spring to teach rice transplanting techniques.
    For thousands of years, the Hui and Han farmers in Wuzhong City have been using extensive broadcasting methods to grow rice, resulting in very low yields. Since the Great Leap Forward last winter, they have been eager to change from broadcasting to transplanting, but no one understood the technique. Zhang Dalu, Zhang Jintang and other ten farmers in Tianjin, upon hearing the Party's call, came to Wuzhong to teach the local farmers transplanting techniques. With their patient help, the local Hui and Han farmers quickly mastered the transplanting techniques. The commune members gratefully said, "The Tianjin farmers are really like family to us, teaching the techniques so kindly and carefully." After that, the Tianjin farmers worked with the local farmers to topdress, irrigate, and weed the rice fields regardless of wind and rain, day and night, sometimes even too busy to eat.
    Recently, when the Tianjin farmers were about to leave Wuzhong City, the local farmers took time out to see them off. The Tianjin farmers Zhang Dalu and Zhang Jintang also used willow branches to weave a vegetable basket and gave it to the local young farmers Zhu Yuxi and Xie Guotai as a souvenir.

    万里送技术
    吴忠市郊区的回汉农民，今年第一次插秧的九百九十三亩水稻，获得了空前大丰收，亩产平均达到一千二百斤左右，产量比当地撒播的水稻高出将近一倍。他们在喜庆大丰收的时候，总是念念不忘今年春天从遥远的天津赶来传授水稻插秧技术的十个回汉老农。
    吴忠市的回汉农民几千年来一直采用粗放的撒播方法种植水稻，产量很低。去冬大跃进以来，他们迫切要求改撒播为插秧，但没人懂这门技术。远在天津的张大禄、张锦堂等十个农民，听到党的号召，就来到吴忠教当地农民兄弟插秧。当地回汉农民在他们的耐心帮助下，很快掌握了插秧技术。社员们感激得说：“天津农民和我们真像一家人，教起技术来又和气、又仔细。”此后，天津农民更是不避风雨、不分昼夜地和当地农民一起给稻田追肥、灌水和薅草，有时甚至忙得连饭也顾不上吃。
    最近，天津农民要离开吴忠市时，当地农民都抽空去送别。天津农民张大禄、张锦堂，还用柳条编了个菜筐，送给当地青年农民朱玉喜和谢国泰留念。
