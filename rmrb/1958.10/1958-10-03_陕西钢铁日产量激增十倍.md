Shaanxi's entire party and all the people are exerting their utmost efforts and catching up rapidly. In early September, the province produced only a dozen tons of pig iron and a few tons of steel per day. By the 29th, this had increased to a daily output of 166 tons of pig iron and 91 tons of steel.

In mid-September, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the situation of iron and steel production and proposed to resolutely overcome discouragement and impetuosity, exert twice the effort, and mobilize the entire party and all the people to engage in the mass movement of iron and steel production, mainly using indigenous methods. Subsequently, Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhao Boping, Secretary, and Zhao Shushan, Governor, led five iron and steel work groups to the iron and steel front lines to supervise the battle in person. By September 28, the number of indigenous iron smelting furnaces had reached 10,972, and twelve indigenous steelmaking furnaces had been built.
