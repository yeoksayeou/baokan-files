    Turning Ruthless Water and Fire into Affection
    Chuan Liu
    When you visit a coal mine, if you are smoking a cigarette, someone will politely ask you to extinguish it before entering the mine. “Ruthless water and fire” is especially evident in mines, and a ban on smoking is an exception for no one.
    Perhaps you will say: How much harm can a small cigarette butt do? The problem is not the cigarette butt itself. Coal mines often contain methane, which is easy to burn. When the methane content in the air exceeds 5%, it will explode when it encounters fire. In the history of coal mining around the world, methane explosions have claimed the lives of countless miners.
    Sometimes methane will suddenly spurt out in large quantities, and coal will also spurt out, causing casualties among coal miners. Therefore, methane is a very annoying thing in the mine. People are constantly watching and recording the instruments that measure the methane content. When the content increases, an alarm is issued, and ventilation equipment is used to exhaust it to the ground.
    Water is also an annoying thing in the mine. Sometimes there is too much water gushing out of the mine. Before mining, a lot of water has to be pumped out, which increases the cost of coal. If water suddenly gushes out, it will cause casualties among the workers.
    In the past, capitalists, for the sake of profit, did not care about the life or death of workers. There was no safety equipment in the mines. In the 18th century, French capitalists even forced workers to risk their lives to set fires in the mines, so that the gas would be burned off before it accumulated in large quantities. This would only cause local explosions and not damage the mine. What about the safety of the workers? They didn't care.
    In our society, safe production is given top priority, and many measures have been taken to prevent accidents caused by methane and groundwater. However, most of these measures are to try to drive out methane, pump out groundwater, or prevent them from suddenly gushing out, which is somewhat passive in nature. In fact, methane and groundwater are useful things, and it is a pity to drive them away for nothing. Methane is mainly biogas, which we are currently using in large quantities. Coal comes from plants, and biogas is also produced in the process of coal formation.
    People who have creativity have the power to control it. The Fushun Mining Bureau has used drilling methods to allow the methane in the coal seam to run out along the boreholes before the coal seam is mined. This methane is then transported to residents' homes for fuel or to factories to manufacture an important industrial raw material—carbon black. Currently, the methane transported for fuel can replace 30,000 tons of coal annually; the methane provided by the Longfeng Coal Mine alone can produce 1,000 tons of carbon black annually.
    As for water, it has now become a useful thing. Because our coal mining technology is undergoing a revolution, water has begun to become a tool for coal mining. A stream of water with extremely high pressure is sprayed from a water gun, causing the coal seam to quickly peel off. Then the coal-water mixture is transported to the ground by water pumps. This hydraulic mining method is safe and fast, and it can also save investment. Therefore, groundwater has also become important. It is not good if there is too little groundwater, because it can only be mainly used for coal mining when the amount of water gushing out of the mine exceeds 100 cubic meters per hour; otherwise, water needs to be transported from the ground to help.
    Methane and groundwater have all turned from bad things into good things. Water and fire were originally ruthless, but now they have become "affectionate." This once again shows that things are not immutable. In an era when mankind is bravely declaring war on nature, people are becoming more and more free.

    水火无情变有情
    川流
    当你到煤矿里去参观的时候，如果正吸着烟卷，一定有人客气地请你在进入矿井以前把它熄灭掉。“水火无情”在矿井里表现得特别显著，严禁烟火是对任何人也不能例外的。
    也许你会说：小小的烟头能有多大危害呢？问题不在烟头本身。煤矿里常常含有易于燃烧的瓦斯，当瓦斯的含量在空气中超过5％时，遇火便要发生爆炸。在世界的采煤史上，瓦斯爆炸不知剥夺了多少矿工的生命。
    有时瓦斯还会突然大量喷出，煤也一块儿喷出，造成采煤工人的伤亡事故。因此，瓦斯在矿井里是很讨厌的东西，人们时刻注视着记录瓦斯含量的仪器，当含量增多时便发出了警号，使用通风设备将它排除到地面去。
    水在矿井里也是讨厌的东西，有时矿井里涌出的水太多，采煤前就不得不大量抽水，增加了煤的成本，要是突然出水，更会造成工人的伤亡。
    从前，资本家为了利润，是不顾工人死活的，矿井里根本没有什么安全设备。十八世纪时，法国的资本家还曾强迫工人冒着生命的危险到矿井中去点火，使瓦斯还没有大量聚集起来以前便被烧掉，这样便只发生局部爆炸，可以不损伤矿井。工人的安全呢？他们是不管的。
    在我们这个社会里，安全生产被提到头等重要的地位，采取了许多措施来防止瓦斯和地下水所引起的事故。但是，这些措施多半是设法把瓦斯赶出去，把地下水抽出去，或是防止他们突然涌出，多少是消极性质的。其实，瓦斯和地下水都是有用的东西，白白地把它们赶跑了实在可惜。瓦斯主要就是目前我们正在大量应用的沼气。煤是植物变来的，在造煤的过程中也造成了沼气。
    发挥了创造性的人，是有力量来控制它的。抚顺矿务局已经用钻孔的办法，使煤层中的瓦斯在煤层开采以前，先就沿着孔道跑了出来。这些瓦斯便被输送到居民家里作为燃料，或是送到工厂里制造重要的工业原料——碳黑。目前输送作燃料的瓦斯每年已可代替三万吨煤；单是龙凤煤矿提供的瓦斯，每年便能制出一千吨碳黑。
    至于水呢，现在也成了有用的东西。因为我们的采煤技术正在革命，水开始成为采煤的工具。压力极大的水流从水枪中喷射出来，使煤层迅速地剥落，然后这些煤水混合物再被水泵运到地面上来。这种水力采煤法既安全，又迅速，而且还能节约投资。因而地下的水也重要起来了。地下水少了还不行，因为矿井中的涌水量每小时超过一百立方公尺以上时才能主要利用它来采煤，否则还需要从地面上输水来帮助。
    瓦斯、地下水都从坏事变成了好事，水火本无情，如今却也变成了“有情”。这又一次说明了事物没有一成不变的，在人类勇于向自然宣战的时代里，人是愈来愈自由了。
