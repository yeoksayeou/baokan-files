Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th: Former Kuomintang military and political personnel, families of Jiang's soldiers, and Taiwan compatriots residing in Fujian Province unanimously support Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots, hoping that the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will actively respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call to hold negotiations, implement peaceful resolution of internal conflicts, unite against external forces, oppose the United States' aggression against Taiwan, and contribute to the completion of the motherland's reunification.

More than a dozen former Kuomintang military and political personnel now in Fuzhou, in a discussion of Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots, unanimously believed that Minister Peng Dehuai's message once again pointed out a bright future for the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

Li Shijia, former Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Navy Department, Commander of the Mawei Fortress, and currently a member of the Fujian Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said that the heroic People's Liberation Army's punitive strike against Jiang's army in Kinmen lasted only a little over a month, and Kinmen was already in a state of running out of ammunition and food. Now, the officers and soldiers of Jiang's army should quickly seize this good opportunity, based on the spirit of patriotism and family unity, accept Minister Peng Dehuai's advice, peacefully resolve internal conflicts, and unite to deal with the common enemy, American imperialism.

The families of Jiang's officers and soldiers residing in Fuzhou City were deeply moved by the spirit of seeking peace and humanitarianism in Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots. Zhao Weikai, whose son Zhao Feikun is currently serving as the deputy division commander of Jiang's army on Kinmen Island and lives on Xia Teng Road in Fuzhou City, said that Kinmen Island is now a caged bird, and our army has taken the initiative to cease shelling, allowing it to freely transport supplies. This humanitarianism is unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.

He said: Minister Peng Dehuai's message pointed out a bright path of meritorious service and redemption for Jiang's officers and soldiers who were sitting and waiting for death. He hopes that his son and his colleagues will accept the government's advice, repent as soon as possible, and rush to the motherland.

Taiwan compatriots residing in Fujian Province all hope that Jiang's officers and soldiers will respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call and peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue through negotiations. Lü Congzhou, a member of the preparatory committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League's Fujian Provincial Branch, said that Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots embodies the infinite care of the people of the motherland for the Taiwan compatriots and Jiang's officers and soldiers. The Taiwan Jiang's officers and soldiers should recognize the overall situation, unite against external forces, resolutely oppose the United States' aggression against Taiwan, and contribute to the realization of the motherland's territorial integrity.
