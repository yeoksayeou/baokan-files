"Salute"
    Miao Sun
    The U.S. Secretary of State arrived in Taiwan in dismay the day after our army resumed artillery fire. The sound of cannons from our Fujian front can be regarded as a "salute" to welcome Dulles.

    This bombardment as a "salute" probably took Dulles by surprise. In fact, Dulles should have known. Minister Peng Dehuai's order stated clearly: "If there is escort, open fire immediately, strictly observe this order!" Not only did the Taiwan authorities fail to show any remorse, but they also intensified their actions, daring to violate the conditions of our army's suspension of artillery fire, and inviting wolves into the house. To punish them, resuming artillery fire is a matter of course. How could Dulles not be clear about this! The reason why Dulles was surprised and had to stop over in Taichung for a few hours to have an emergency long-distance call with Eisenhower was because this fierce "salute" not only made him panic, but also disrupted all his conspiracies and tricks, leaving him at a loss.

    "Americans are absolutely not allowed to interfere in Chinese affairs." Although we have said this thousands of times, it seems that it is still impossible to make Dulles' granite head open up. From this point of view, the United Press International's view that our army's resumption of artillery fire was "a direct slap in Dulles' face" is also reasonable. We can only add: if the U.S. armed forces still赖 (lai: rely on; hang around) in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait and refuse to leave, this slap will still have to be delivered, and it will become more and more severe. Because we understand that using artillery against people like Dulles is more effective than using other means.

   “礼炮”
    苗隼
    美国国务卿在我军恢复炮击的第二天黯然到了台湾。我福建前线的炮声，可以当作欢迎杜勒斯的“礼炮”。
    这“礼炮”的轰击大概很出杜勒斯的意外。其实，杜勒斯应该心里有数。彭德怀部长的命令上说得明明白白：“如有护航，立即开炮，切切此令！”台湾当局非但不知悔悟，而且变本加厉，胆敢违反我军暂停炮击的条件，引狼入室；为了加以惩罚，恢复炮击，乃是天经地义的事。杜勒斯何尝不清楚！杜勒斯之所以感到意外以致不得不在去台中途多停留几小时同艾森豪威尔紧急通长途电话，乃是因为这猛烈的“礼炮”不仅打得他心慌意乱，而且打乱他的全部阴谋鬼计，使他手足无措。
    “中国人的事绝不允许美国人插手”，这句话，尽管我们已经说了千百遍，可是想使杜勒斯的花岗石脑袋开窍，看来现在还没有可能。从这点上说，合众国际社认为我军恢复炮击是“直接打了杜勒斯一记耳光”，也还有理。只是我们可以补充一句：要是美国武装部队仍然赖在台湾和台湾海峡不走，这耳光总还是要打下去，而且越打越厉害。因为我们懂得对杜勒斯这样的人用炮是比用别的更有效的。
