Agricultural Science Must Solve New Problems in the Great Leap Forward

Editor's Note: The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in our country has not only left behind many domestic and foreign records of high yield far behind but has also thoroughly broken various stale theories in agricultural science. The peasant masses have already made great contributions to this cause of breaking the old and establishing the new in agricultural science. However, the rich practical experience of the peasant masses still needs to be summarized and elevated to become a systematic and complete theory, which in turn will guide and promote an even greater leap forward in agricultural production. This requires not only the efforts of the peasant masses but also the joint efforts of agricultural scientists. To this end, this newspaper invited some agricultural scientists in Beijing on September 11th to hold a symposium to discuss some new problems that the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has raised for agricultural science and that need to be studied and solved urgently. The participants in this symposium included: Liu Chun'an, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Cai Banghua, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xu Ji, Deputy Director of the Institute of Animal Husbandry of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fang Cuinong, Deputy Director of the Institute of Crop Cultivation and Breeding of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Ye Hecai, Deputy Director of the Department of Soil and Agricultural Chemistry of Beijing Agricultural University, Zhu Guanghuan, Researcher of the Institute of Crop Cultivation and Breeding of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Tao Dinglai, Engineer of the Institute of Agricultural Mechanization of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wang Kening, Assistant Researcher of the Institute of Plant Protection of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Ge Fuyuan, Technician of the Economic Crop Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Yang Shufan. The following is a record of their speeches.

Learn from the Great Creative Spirit of the Peasants
Their Practices Break Many Stale Rules of Agricultural Science
Liu Chun'an

The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has proven with countless vivid facts that peasants have a great creative spirit. They have created many new experiences in production practice and solved problems that agricultural science has not been able to solve for a long time. Agricultural scientists must learn from the peasants. For example, on the issue of varieties, what was considered "good" or "bad" in the past was determined under low-yield conditions. The reason why some varieties had low yields was because they were not allowed to exert their potential. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil have changed, and the advantages and disadvantages of varieties have also changed. Low-yielding varieties have become high-yielding after being fully supplied with water and fertilizer, and the previous saying that certain varieties "degenerate" is no longer applicable. Therefore, in the future, the selection and breeding of varieties must be based on new conditions.

Taking deep plowing and fertilization as an example, the experiences created by peasants in the Great Leap Forward have broken the "rules" recorded in soil science and fertilizer science. In the past, people were afraid that deep plowing would reduce production and cause lodging, but now practice has proven that deep plowing is one of the conditions for increasing production and preventing lodging. The reason why deep plowing reduced production and caused lodging in the past was because it was not combined with rational fertilization. After rational fertilization, the fertilizer itself played a role in the crops, and the fertilizer could also promote changes in the soil structure. The same goes for close planting. In the past, people were afraid that close planting would cause lodging, but now it has been proven that the closer the planting, the less likely it is to lodge. The experience of transplanting rice seedlings in Hubei Province is also worthy of attention. In recent years, the yield of early rice has been stable, but there have been problems with late rice, and the yield is unstable. This is because late rice is not harvested until the end of October and the beginning of November, and the cold weather causes more unfilled grains. This year, a few days before the heading of early rice in Hubei, the seedlings from more than ten mu of fields were transplanted into one mu of field to continue growing, and late rice was immediately planted in the vacated fields, one month earlier. In this way, late rice can not only be stabilized but also greatly increase its yield. If two seasons of rice are not planted, the vacated fields after transplanting seedlings can also be planted with a season of green manure or other crops, and the method of transplanting seedlings can also be used for late rice. In this way, there will be sufficient time to prepare the land for planting wheat, which can greatly increase the yield of wheat. If green manure is planted instead of wheat, a high yield can also be achieved.

Let's talk about fertilization. Due to the greatly increased crop yield, the amount of fertilizer absorbed has also changed. In the past, the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizers was 1:0.5:0.7, but now it has changed to 1.9 for nitrogen, 2 for phosphorus, and 4 for potassium. Why has this change occurred? Because the ratio of grain to straw is different. In the past, the ratio of grain to straw was 100:100, but now the grain is 30,000 jin, and the straw is not 30,000 jin but much less than the weight of the grain. In the past, 20 jin of nitrogen fertilizer was needed for every 1,000 jin of grain, but now it is not necessary to apply that much. This shows that after deep plowing, the soil's own fertility has increased, and it is very likely that the microorganisms in the soil have developed. These are all issues worthy of study.

    农业科学要解决大跃进中的新问题
    编者按：我国的农业生产大跃进，不但把古今中外的很多丰产纪录远远地抛到后面，而且把农业科学上的各种陈腐理论也彻底打破了。农民群众在农业科学的这一破旧立新的事业中已经作出伟大的贡献。但是，农民群众丰富的生产实践经验，还有待于总结和提高，使它成为系统的完整的理论，反过来再去指导和推动农业生产更大的跃进，这不仅需要农民群众的努力，还需要农业科学工作者共同的努力。为此，本报曾在9月11日邀集在京的一部分农业科学工作者开了一次座谈会，讨论了农业生产大跃进给农业科学工作提出的亟待研究和解决的一些新问题。参加这次座谈会的有：中国农业科学院副秘书长刘春安、中国科学院昆虫研究所副所长蔡邦华、农业科学院畜牧研究所副所长徐矶、农业科学院作物栽培育种研究所副所长方悴农、北京农业大学土壤农化系副主任叶和才、农业科学院作物栽培育种研究所研究员朱光焕、农业科学院农业机械化研究所工程师陶鼎来、农业科学院植物保护研究所助理研究员汪可宁、农业部经济作物局技师戈福元、杨树藩。下面便是他们的发言记录。
    学习农民伟大的创造精神
    他们的实践打破了农业科学上很多陈腐的规律
    刘春安
    农业生产大跃进以无数生动的事实证明，农民具有极大的创造精神，他们在生产实践中创造了许多新的经验，解决了农业科学上长久不能解决的问题。农业科学工作者必须向农民学习。如在品种问题上，过去认为“好的”或“不好的”，是在低产的条件下决定的，有的品种所以低产，是因为没使它发挥潜在的力量。在大跃进的形势下，水、肥、土等条件变了，品种的优劣也就发生了变化。低产的在水饱肥足之后变成了高产的，过去认定的某些品种“退化”的说法也不适用了。所以今后选育品种，必须依据新的条件来进行。
    以深耕施肥来说，在大跃进中农民创造的经验就打破了土壤学、肥料学上记载的“规律”。过去怕深耕了要减产、倒伏，现在实践却证明深耕正是增产、防倒伏的条件之一。过去深耕之所以减产和倒伏，是因为没有同合理施肥结合起来。合理施肥后，肥料本身对作物起了作用，而且肥料也可以促使土壤的结构改变。密植也一样。过去怕密植了要倒伏，现在证明越密越不易倒伏。还有湖北省水稻采取掇秧的经验也值得重视。几年来早稻的产量是稳定的，可是晚稻有问题，产量不稳定，因为晚稻到10月底11月初不收，天气冷了就瘪子多。今年湖北早稻在抽穗前几天把十几亩田的秧移掇在一亩田里继续生长，在空出的田里立即插上晚稻，时间提前了一个月。这样，晚稻不但可以稳定，而且也可以大大提高产量。如果不栽两季稻子，掇秧后空出的田也可以栽一季绿肥或其他作物，晚稻也可以用掇秧的办法。这样种小麦就有充分的时间整地，可以使小麦的产量大为提高。如果不种小麦而种绿肥，同样可以高产。
    再说施肥问题。由于作物产量大大提高，肥料的吸收量也起了变化。过去肥料中氮、磷、钾的比例，是一比零点五比零点七，现在变了，氮是一点九，磷是二，钾是四。为什么会发生这样的变化呢？因为谷与草的比例不同了，过去谷与草是一百比一百，现在谷是三万斤，草不是三万斤，而是比谷子重量少多了。过去一千斤谷需施二十斤氮肥，现在不必施那么多了。这说明深耕以后，土壤本身的肥力增加了，很可能是土壤里的微生物有了发展。这都是值得研究的问题。
