According to the Shanxi Daily, Shilu County, located on the Jinxi Plateau and known for its barrenness, has completely changed its low-yield status after a year of hard work. The county's 93,000 mu of basic farmland (excluding 29,000 mu of economic crops) has now been harvested, with an average actual yield of 1,004 jin per mu, a 19.5-fold increase compared to the 49 jin per mu in 1957, and a 12.6-fold increase compared to the 74 jin per mu in the bumper year of 1956. Adding the grain produced from agroforestry and agro-grass intercropping on the sloping land that was fallowed this year, the county's total output reached 103.83 million jin, an increase of 5.1 times compared to the 17.11 million jin last year. This year's total output is equal to 90% of the total grain output during the First Five-Year Plan period from 1953 to 1957. The per capita grain ownership in the county has increased from 380 jin last year to 2,596 jin.

The reason why Shilu County has been able to leap from a "low-yield" area to a place of great grain surplus this year is that the people of the county, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, changed the old cultivation system of "extensive planting with meager harvests" and resolutely adopted the system of planting less with more harvests, that is, the establishment of a basic farmland system. The county originally had 380,000 mu of cultivated land, with an average of nearly 10 mu per person. The vast majority of these lands are distributed on the loess ridges and gullies with slopes of up to 50 degrees, and on the mid-slopes or tops of the gullies, making the farming conditions extremely harsh. People could only get a meager harvest of 30 to 50 jin from each mu of land. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the county carried out large-scale soil and water conservation work, and have achieved considerable success. However, the fundamental way to change the low-yield and poverty situation was only found last winter. At that time, there were two paths in front of the people: should they follow the old path of "extensive planting with meager harvests" and implement gradualism with reformist methods? Or should they use revolutionary methods to establish basic farmland centered on gully land reclamation to achieve a great leap forward? Under the leadership of the county party committee, the people of the county, through large-scale airing of views, debates, and discussions, with the consent of the majority of the masses, resolutely chose the latter method. The county party committee also made a decision to vigorously develop basic farmland. Afterwards, a basic farmland construction headquarters was established, and three county party committee secretaries and one county head were assigned to lead this work. After two months, the county successively built 4,210 earth and stone dams in the loess gullies, completing more than 90,000 mu of gully land reclamation projects. Among them, 30,000 mu can be planted this year and have already achieved a great harvest. These 30,000 mu of land produced a total of 41.45 million jin of autumn grain, which is more than twice the total grain output of the county last year, with an average yield of 1,350 jin per mu.

The unprecedented bumper harvest in Shilu County vividly demonstrates that establishing a basic farmland system centered on gully land reclamation is the best direction for transforming nature in mountainous areas. Gully land reclamation has the following advantages: First, by changing the cultivated land planted on the slopes to planting in the gullies, it can conserve water and moisture, and can maximize the use of decayed grass and wood from the mountains and animal manure as fertilizer; Second, moving cultivated land from the mountains to the gullies also facilitates the use of livestock and vehicles for farmland transportation, completely changing the phenomenon of carrying by shoulder and improving labor efficiency; Third, the establishment of gully land reclamation can also be closely integrated with soil and water conservation work, achieving two goals at once.

The bumper harvest has ended poverty for the people of Shilu County. More than 10,000 farmers in the county's four people's communes have generally achieved surplus grain in every commune and prosperity in every household. According to the distribution plan recently formulated by the county party committee, the county is preparing to overfulfill the state grain purchase task by 1.38 times this year, and the amount of grain retained per person will be increased to 600 jin. In addition, each person will also reserve one to one and a half years of reserve grain. At the same time, the average income of the people in the county will also increase from 25 yuan last year to 50 yuan. The great grain harvest has laid the foundation for vigorously developing animal husbandry. The county's livestock feed retention has increased by an average of one time compared to last year. In the past, people did not dare to raise pigs in large numbers due to lack of feed, but now this difficulty has been completely resolved. Therefore, the county's pig raising plan will increase from the current 4,000 heads to 80,000 heads. In this way, in addition to selling 20,000 heads to the state, each person can eat an average of 30 to 50 jin of pork. At the same time, combined with land fallowing for afforestation, the amount of edible oil and fruit available to people will also greatly increase.

Recently, the entire Shilu County has been immersed in an atmosphere of joy. From the mountain gullies to the plains, from the fields to the threshing grounds, there is joy everywhere and songs at all times. People are celebrating this year's bumper harvest and the newly started prosperous life with unparalleled emotion.

    缩小耕地面积　提高单位产量
    石楼县粮帅一步登天
    去年亩产四十九斤　今年跳过千斤大关
    据山西日报消息　地处晋西高原、素称贫瘠的石楼县，经过一年苦战，彻底改变了低产面貌。全县九万三千亩基本农田（二万九千亩经济作物不包括在内），现在已经收割完毕，每亩平均实产达到一千零四斤，与1957年亩产四十九斤相比，提高了十九倍半，与大丰收的1956年亩产七十四斤相比，也提高了十二点六倍。再加上今年停耕坡地中农林间作和农草间作所产的粮食，全县总产量达到一亿零三百八十三万斤，与去年的一千七百一十一万斤相比，增加五点一倍。今年的总产量等于第一个五年计划期间1953年至1957年粮食产量总和的90％。全县每人平均粮食由去年的三百八十斤提高到二千五百九十六斤。
    今年石楼县所以能够由“低产”区一跃而为粮食大大富裕之地，是全县人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，改变了以往“广种薄收”的旧的耕作制度，坚决地采用了少种多收、即建立基本农田制度的结果。全县原有三十八万亩耕地，每人平均近十亩。这些土地，绝大部分分布在坡度达五十度的黄土梁峁及沟壑的半坡或顶端，耕作条件十分恶劣，人们只能从每一亩地里得到三、五十斤的低微收获。解放后，全县人民在党的领导下，大搞水土保持工作，已经得到不少成就。但是，从根本上改变低产、贫困面貌的道路还是在去年冬天才找到的。当时，摆在人们面前有两条道路，是沿着旧的“广种薄收”的道路，以改良主义的办法实行渐进呢？还是以革命办法，建立以沟地漫地为中心的基本农田，实现大跃进呢？县委领导全县人民，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论，在大多数群众的同意下，坚决地选择了后一种办法。县委并作出了大搞基本农田的决定。之后，还建立了基本农田建设指挥部，抽出三个县委书记和一个县长去领导这一工作。经过两个月的时间，全县先后在黄土沟壑中打起土、石坝四千二百一十条，完成了九万多亩淤沟漫地工程。其中有三万亩今年就能种植，并且已经获得大丰收。这三万亩地共产秋粮四千一百四十五万斤，等于去年全县粮食总产量的二倍多，每亩平均产粮一千三百五十斤。
    石楼县空前大丰收的实践生动地表明，建立以沟地漫地为中心的基本农田制，是土石山区改造大自然的最好方向。沟地漫地有以下几点优越性：第一，把种在山坡上的耕地改种到山沟中，可以蓄水保墒，并可以最大限度地利用山上的朽草朽木和牲畜遗弃的粪便当作肥料；第二、耕地从山上换到沟里，也便于使用牲口、车辆进行农田的运输工作，彻底改变肩挑人担的现象，提高劳动效率；第三、建立沟地漫地还可以和水土保持工作密切结合进行，一举两得。
    大丰收使石楼县人民结束了贫困。全县四个人民公社的一万多个农户，普遍实现了社社有余粮，户户都富裕。按照县委最近制定的分配方案，今年全县准备超额一点三八倍完成国家粮食征购任务，每人留粮增加到六百斤。此外，每人还要储备一年到一年半的储备粮。同时，全县人民的平均收入也由去年的二十五元提高到五十元。粮食大丰收，给大力发展畜牧业打下了基础。全县所有的牲畜饲料留量，平均比去年提高了一倍。过去人们由于缺少饲料而不敢大量养猪，现在这个困难已经全部解决。因此，全县的养猪计划将由现在的四千头增加为八万头。这样，除卖给国家两万头以外，每个人可以平均吃到三十到五十斤猪肉。与此同时，结合土地停耕还林，人们的食油和水果数量也将大大增加。
    最近以来，整个石楼县一直沉浸在欢乐的气氛中，从山沟到平川，从田间到打谷场，处处是喜悦，时时有歌声，人们以无可比拟的心情在祝贺今年的大丰收，庆祝刚刚开始的富裕生活。
