We Want Communism, Not Piece-Rate Wages

On the 18th of this month, the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the theoretical propaganda department of this newspaper jointly invited fourteen worker comrades from Tianjin to discuss the issues of breaking down bourgeois legal rights ideology and establishing a communist labor attitude. The following are excerpts from four speeches at the symposium:

	For Communism, Not for Money
	Tianjin Canvas Factory Weaving Worker Sun Piqi

	The hard battle began in September. The factory director said: "Let's do it! However much the output increases, the wages will increase accordingly. We will pay according to labor." When I heard this, I felt something was wrong. Many people in the same workshop, such as Cai Ruilin, Xu Qige, and Xiao Yuchi, also said: We are fighting hard for communism, not for money. At that time, I went to the Party Branch Secretary to reflect our opinions. The Party supported us, and the factory director quickly changed his statement and also made a self-criticism to everyone. However, some comrades in our workshop could not understand this ideology and disagreed with hard work without money, saying, "How much work you do, you should get that much money, that's only right." "The department store strives for ten satisfactions, a hundred satisfactions, if you don't pay, you won't get anything." The operating rate also decreased a bit, and some people took sick leave for minor illnesses. In response to this ideology, we launched a debate in the workshop.

	After several days of debate, some comrades who did not clearly understand the hard battle made self-criticisms. The person who initially opposed me comparing the hard battle to the arduousness of the Red Army's Long March also realized that he had forgotten his roots. After this debate, people's ideological awareness was greatly improved, and they expressed: We fight hard for three years, for ten thousand years of happiness.

	From now until the end of the year, our factory has increased its production task by 240,000 meters, and we guarantee to complete it without adding a single person. Now, we are experimenting with three people operating eight machines instead of one person operating two machines. Our slogan is: Work as long as there is electricity, obey the distribution, determined to fight hard, willingly and gladly. With improved ideology, the completion of the task is guaranteed.

### 要共产主义，不要计件工资  为共产主义，不是为钱

    要共产主义，不要计件工资
    本月18日，中共天津市委宣传部和本报理论宣传部共同邀请天津市十四位工人同志，就破除资产阶级法权思想和树立共产主义劳动态度问题进行了座谈。现将座谈会上的发言选择四篇摘要发表如下：
    为共产主义，不是为钱
    天津市帆布厂织布工人  孙丕祺
    9月份开始苦战，厂长说：“干吧！产量增多少，工资就增多少，咱们按劳付酬。”我听了，心里感到不对劲，同车间的蔡瑞林、许其阁、萧玉池等好些人也都说：我们苦战是为了共产主义，不是为了钱。当时，我就去找党总支书记，反映了我们的意见。党支持我们，厂长很快地改了他的说法，还向大家作了检讨。可是，我们车间有一部分同志思想搞不通，不同意苦战不要钱。说“干多少活就得给多少钱，这是理所应当的。”“百货公司搞十满意，百满意，你不拿钱也不给你东西。”开车率也有点降低，有人有点小病就歇班。针对这种思想，我们就在车间展开了辩论。
    经过几天的辩论，一些对苦战认识不清的同志做了检查，开头反对我拿苦战和红军长征的艰苦相比的人，也认识到是自己忘了本。经过这场辩论，人们的思想觉悟大大提高了，纷纷表示：苦战三年，幸福万年。
    从现在到年底，我厂增加了二十四万公尺的生产任务，我们保证在不增添一个人的条件下完成它。现在已由一个人看两台车试着三个人看八台车。我们的口号是：有电就干，服从分配，决心苦战，甘心情愿。思想提高了完成任务就有了保证。
