Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: Shandong Province's autumn plowing and planting campaign has entered a decisive stage. The province's 25 million-strong agricultural army is stepping up the autumn harvest while carrying out communist-style large-scale cooperation to rush to plow and plant wheat, determined to achieve a thousand-斤 (jin, a unit of weight equal to 0.5 kg) wheat province next year. As of the 15th, out of the province's 80 million mu of wheat fields, 51.27 million mu had been deep-plowed, and 33.11 million mu had been sown. Of the land that has been deep-plowed, 70% has a plowing depth of 1.5 chi (a unit of length equal to 1/3 meter) or more, and 77% has a fertilizer application rate exceeding 100,000 jin per mu. In the wheat fields that have been sown, 72% have a sowing rate of 30 jin or more per mu, and about 80% of the seeds have been treated with warm water soaking and pesticide mixing. In order to ensure the quality of cultivation, various regions have strengthened acceptance inspections and comparisons, and any substandard work is being reworked and retaken.

Various communes resoundingly put forward the slogan "I am for everyone, everyone is for me, plant wheat well to guarantee a thousand-斤 province," and regardless of county or commune boundaries, regardless of mountainous areas or plains, they go to support wherever progress is slow. Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Yanggu, after completing their wheat planting tasks, formed a 10,000-person corps, bringing their own food, clothing, and farm tools to support Dongping and Pingyin counties. The number of people participating in large-scale cooperation among counties, communes, and teams in the Laiyang area totaled about 678,000. Jiangshanwa in Laixi County was slow to make progress in autumn planting, and Zhaoyuan and Qixia counties immediately organized an 8,000-strong expeditionary volunteer army, trekking over mountains and braving rain to rush to help. The 2,000 plowing experts from the Qijia Commune in Huangxian County formed a volunteer army, carrying shovels, hoes, and luggage, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, trekking 50 li (a unit of distance equal to 0.5 km) to support wheat planting in Xiangcheng Commune. Among them, 40 brave generals led a team to fight fiercely in the rain on the 10th, plowing 390 mu of land in one day and night, an increase of 46 mu compared to the daily progress in sunny weather. Local commune members built simple shelters for them, busily boiling water and cooking dishes to ensure they ate and lived well. This moving scene of communist-style large-scale cooperation inspires the labor enthusiasm and soaring drive of millions of people. Some farmers in the supported areas, moved to tears, stayed up for several nights to speed up their work. In order to reverse the situation of slow progress, the Shuguang Commune in Huangxian County installed batteries and lights on all plows and sowed seeds overnight.

Shandong Province's autumn plowing and planting are being advanced through the mass movement of airing views, debating, and planting red flags and pulling out white flags, constantly criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking. The province has successively removed more than 26,000 cadres with white flags, and at the same time, millions of heroic models have emerged, forming a huge group of red and expert activists. These activists, leading millions of people, are like fierce tigers descending the mountain, unstoppable, sweeping away all kinds of right-leaning conservative thoughts. Right-leaning conservatives shouted at the beginning of the movement, "If the land is plowed too deep, water and wheat will leak out, and the cold soil will not sprout." "There is a shortage of labor, and a large area cannot be plowed." In the middle of the movement, they shouted again, "The task is heavy, time is tight, and planting quickly cannot be done well." After the early crops were planted, they shouted, "Rest before continuing," and after the rain, they shouted, "The weather is cold and the ground is wet, so we can't fight at night." These fallacies were all refuted in the mass airing of views and debates. Liaocheng County originally plowed 30,000 to 40,000 mu of land per day, with less than 200,000 laborers mobilized, and some people thought it could not be improved any further. But after a big debate, thousands of heroic companies and teams, full of spirit, organized an army of 300,000 people, plowing 110,000 mu of land a day; many people increased their daily plowing from 0.1-0.2 mu to 0.4-0.5 mu. Junan County mobilized more than 28,000 professional troops to rush to make rope-pulled plows. After 48 hours of hard work, they made 16,197 plows, increasing the efficiency of deep plowing by eight times.

In the autumn harvesting, plowing, and planting movement, Shandong Province pays great attention to arranging the lives of the masses, so that millions of laboring troops are full of energy and become stronger as they fight. Liaocheng area has established special agencies to manage the lives of the masses from the area and county to the commune, strengthening the leadership of the people's commune's public canteens. Now many canteens have reached "six goods": coarse grains are finely made, people eat their fill, eat cooked and hot food, and there are many varieties. Now that the weather is getting colder, many communes have established shoe and sock factories and clothing factories to solve the problem of cotton clothes, quilts, shoes, and socks for commune members to get through the winter.

### 山东秋种进入决战阶段  农业大军全力协作，种麦质量精益求精

    山东秋种进入决战阶段
    农业大军全力协作，种麦质量精益求精
    据新华社济南19日电　山东省秋耕秋种战役进入决战阶段。全省两千五百万农业大军在加紧收秋的同时，开展共产主义大协作突击翻地种麦，决心明年实现小麦千斤省。到15日为止，全省八千万亩麦田，已经深翻五千一百二十七万亩，播种三千三百一十一万亩。已经深翻的土地，耕深一尺五寸以上的占70％，亩施肥量超过十万斤的占77％。已下种的麦田，72％的亩播种量在三十斤以上，80％左右的种子都经过温汤浸种，农药拌种。各地为了保证耕种规格质量，加强了验收评比，不合规格质量的一律返工补课。
    各地公社响亮提出了“我为人人、人人为我，种好小麦保证千斤省”的口号，不分县、社界线，不分山区和平原，哪里进度慢就到哪里去支援。寿张、范县、阳谷在完成种麦任务后，组成万人兵团，自带粮食、衣被、农具，支援东平、平阴两县。莱阳专区各县、社、队之间参加大协作的人数共约六十七万八千多人。莱西县姜山洼秋种进度迟缓，招远、栖霞两县马上组织八千名远征志愿军，翻山越岭星夜冒雨赶去帮助。黄县七甲公社二千名翻地健将组成的志愿军，扛着锨镢行李爬山越岭，跋涉五十里，支援乡城公社种麦。其中四十名虎将带动一队人在10日冒雨大战，一昼夜翻地三百九十亩，比晴天日进量增加四十六亩。当地社员给他们搭起窝铺，忙着烧水做菜，使他们吃好住好。这种共产主义大协作的动人情景，鼓舞着千百万人民的劳动热情和冲天干劲。一些被支援地区的农民，感动得几夜不睡觉，加劲向前赶。黄县曙光公社为扭转进度迟缓局面，把所有耧具安上电池和电灯，连夜播种。
    山东省的秋耕秋种，是在开展鸣放辩论和插红旗拔白旗的群众运动中，不断批判右倾保守思想向前推进的。全省先后拔掉白旗干部二万六千多人，同时涌现出几百万个英雄模范，形成了庞大的红专积极分子群。这些积极分子带领千百万群众，犹如猛虎下山，势不可当，扫除了形形色色的右倾保守思想。右倾保守主义者在运动开始时，叫喊“地翻深了漏水漏麦，土寒不发苗。”“劳力少，大面积翻不过来。”在运动中期，又叫喊“任务重，时间紧，种快不能种好。”早茬种完后叫喊“歇歇再干”，下雨后又叫喊“天冷地湿不能夜战”。这些谬论，都在群众大鸣大放大辩论中给驳倒了。聊城县原来每天翻地三、四万亩，出动劳力不到二十万人，有些人认为再也不能提高了。但经过一场大辩论，几千个英雄连、队，精神焕发，组织起三十万大军，一天翻地十一万亩；许多人由每天翻地一、二分提高到四、五分。莒南县动员二万八千多名专业大军赶制绳索牵引犁。奋战四十八个小时，制成一万六千一百九十七部，把深翻效率提高了八倍。
    在秋收、秋耕、秋种运动中，山东省很注意安排群众生活，使千百万劳动大军精神奕奕，越战越强。聊城专区从专区、县到公社，都建立了专门管理群众生活的机构，加强人民公社公共食堂的领导。现在许多食堂已经达到“六好”。粗粮细做，吃饱喝足，吃熟吃热，花样多。现在天气已渐冷，许多公社建立了鞋袜厂、被服厂，解决社员过冬棉衣、被褥、鞋袜问题。
