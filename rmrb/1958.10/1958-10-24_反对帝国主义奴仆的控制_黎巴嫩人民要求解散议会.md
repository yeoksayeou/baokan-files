Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 22nd. According to reports in the newspapers here today, the result of the election of the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament on the 21st has aroused widespread indignation among the Lebanese people. On the same day, the Lebanese people held a grand demonstration in Beirut, shouting slogans against the current parliament established by the former Chamoun government, and demanding the dissolution of this parliament and the holding of new elections.

    National Front leader Salam addressed the demonstrators. He said, "The parliament must be dissolved because it does not represent the people." He also said, "We hope you will wait, and you will see legitimate members elect Hamad as speaker in the near future."

    Prime Minister Karami also rushed to the demonstration site and told the demonstrators that he and his colleagues in the National Front had tried their best to get Hamad elected, but the majority of the parliament supported Oseiran. He asked the people to "remain calm." He told the crowd that the new Lebanese regime would not be affected by Oseiran's election as speaker.

    Hamad, the National Front's candidate for speaker, addressed the demonstrators. He said that the majority of the current parliament has once again proved that it does not represent the people, but only represents imperialism. The imperialists order this majority to do what they do, and they obey the orders of the imperialists.

    According to a special correspondent of "Al Shaab" in Beirut, the leaders of the National Front are now convinced that as long as the current parliament exists, there will be no peace in Lebanon and the political situation will not be stable.

    "Guangming Daily" said today that Chamoun's followers are trying their best to maintain the current parliament. At the same time, the American ambassador to Lebanon is desperately trying to strengthen American rule in Lebanon, hypocritically expressing his intention to provide emergency economic and financial "assistance" to help establish Lebanon's economy.

    反对帝国主义奴仆的控制
    黎巴嫩人民要求解散议会
    新华社大马士革22日电　据这里的报纸今天报道，黎巴嫩议会21日举行议长选举的结果，在黎巴嫩人民中间引起了普遍的愤慨。黎巴嫩人民当天在贝鲁特举行了盛大的示威，高呼口号，反对前夏蒙政府所成立的本届议会，并要求解散这届议会，举行新的选举。
    民族阵线领袖萨拉姆向示威群众发表了演说。他说，“议会必须解散，因为它并不代表人民。”他还说，“我们希望你们等待，你们就可以看到合法的议员在最近的将来选举哈马德为议长。”
    卡拉米总理也赶到举行示威的地点，对示威群众说，他和他在民族阵线中的同僚们曾经竭力想使哈马德当选，但是议会大多数都支持奥塞兰。他要求人民“保持平静”。他对群众表示，黎巴嫩新政权不会由于奥塞兰当选议长而受到影响。
    民族阵线的议长候选人哈马德向示威群众发表演说。他说，本届议会的大多数再次证明，它并不代表人民，而只代表帝国主义。帝国主义命令这些大多数怎样做，他们就听从帝国主义的命令。
    据“沙牧国报”驻贝鲁特特派记者报道，民族阵线领袖们现在确信，只要本届议会存在，黎巴嫩国内就不会平静，政治局势就不会稳定。
    “光明报”今天说，夏蒙分子正在竭力保持本届议会。同时美国驻黎巴嫩大使正在拼命企图加强美国在黎巴嫩的统治，他故作姿态地表示要提供紧急的经济和财政“援助”来帮助建立黎巴嫩的经济。
