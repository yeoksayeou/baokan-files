	Semi-Supply System—A Sprout of Communism
	Currently, many people's communes are implementing a system of grain supply plus basic wages and bonuses. What is the significance of this system? The editorial "On the Semi-Supply System," published in the fourth issue of "Dongfeng," a theoretical publication sponsored by the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, elaborates on this issue. The editorial states: Changing the original system of remuneration based on workdays in agricultural cooperatives to a semi-supply system, like the abolition of private plots, private small woodlands, and privately owned livestock, is a significant reform in rural production relations. The latter represents the elimination of the remnants of private ownership of the means of production, while the former represents the further development of socialist principles in product distribution and the growth of communist factors.
	The editorial then analyzes the nature of the semi-supply system, pointing out: The semi-supply system is still a socialist distribution system. Its wage and labor bonus component is based on the principle of "to each according to his work," assessed and implemented based on labor strength, technical skill, and work attitude. However, the provision of food by the commune for all, and the full support of the living expenses of the elderly who have lost their ability to work by the commune, already goes beyond the scope of "to each according to his work." With the greater development of production and the realization of ample food and clothing, a full-supply system can be gradually implemented. Although the semi-supply system is still limited to solving the problem of grain supply first, or solving the minimum living needs of some people, it already contains the seeds of communist principles. The editorial points out: This reform of the distribution system, the semi-supply system, will inevitably promote the further development of productive forces and significant changes in human relations. Solving the problem of food and providing for the elderly and nurturing the young relieves the broad masses of commune members of the burden of supporting their families, eliminates their worries, and enables them to concentrate more on production and learning cultural techniques. The editorial states: Direct payment of wages to the laborers themselves will greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the labor force, especially the labor enthusiasm of young people and women, destroy the patriarchal system inherited from the old society, and facilitate family harmony and equality among people.
	The editorial criticizes some people's concern that the implementation of the semi-supply system will affect people's labor enthusiasm. The editorial says that this is an incorrect idea that underestimates the consciousness of the working people.

Our Reality's Characteristics: Socialist System Plus Communist Thought
	The theoretical publication "July 1st" of the Hubei Provincial Committee, in its fourth issue published today, features an article titled "Launch a Large-Scale Communist Ideological Movement," which focuses on elaborating the argument that "the socialist system plus communist thought is a feature of our reality." The article points out that at present, there are still two different attitudes in dealing with the relationship between labor and remuneration: one is paying for labor, which is a capitalist labor attitude that we should constantly criticize; the other is consciously "working for everyone without pay" (Lenin's words), which is a communist labor attitude that we should vigorously promote. From the "Communist Thought is Growing" column and other articles in the fourth issue of "July 1st," which report on new people and new events, it can be seen that the communist spirit in treating labor and the collective is permeating all aspects of our working people. If these advanced figures increase, our social production will develop faster and faster.
	The article criticizes two misunderstandings: one is "thinking that communism is to disrupt and divide equally on the existing material basis," and the other is "thinking that since it is now a socialist system, there is no need to vigorously promote the communist spirit." The article believes that a large-scale communist ideological movement should be launched to enable people to see the beautiful communist prospects of tomorrow in today's socialist system, and to strive to prepare conditions for the early completion of socialism and the gradual transition to communism.

	Shouting for Communist Ideas
	The theoretical publication "Liberation," sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, published its seventh issue today (October 1st), featuring an article titled "Ordinary People, Extraordinary Creations." The article introduces Li Zhixiang, a young electric welding apprentice at the Shanghai Acid-Resistant Enamel Factory, who overcame various difficulties and dangers to trial-produce a type of electric welding gas generated from lime plus other raw materials. The article contains a very touching passage from Li Zhixiang, which is that when he discovered the potential danger of explosion in the mixed combustion gas of lime and other fuels, Li Zhixiang asked the master worker to leave, and said to the master worker: "You have a large family, I have no burden. Your technology is good, and your contribution to the country is greater. I am an apprentice, even if an accident happens, the loss to the country will be smaller." The magazine published a commentary titled "New People, New Ideas" for this. The commentary points out: The reason why Li Zhixiang has such noble communist feelings and a noble communist style is because he does not work for personal fame and fortune, but for the country, for the people, and for socialism, and because he has a communist spirit.
	The commentary points out: We should always pay attention to the communist ideological factors that occur among the broad masses, publicize and shout about them, use them to carry out communist education, and fight against the remaining influences of various exploiting class ideologies.

    半供给制——	  共产主义的萌芽
    目前，很多人民公社都在实行粮食供给和基本工资加奖励的制度，这种制度有什么意义呢？中共河北省委主办的理论刊物“东风”第四期发表的“论半供给制”的社论，阐述了这个问题。社论说：把原来农业社的按劳动日计酬的制度改为半供给制，这和取消自留地、取消私有小片林木、私有牲畜同样是农村生产关系上的一个重要改革。后者表现为生产资料私有制的残余的消灭，前者表现为产品分配上社会主义原则的进一步发展和共产主义因素的增长。
    社论接着分析了半供给制的性质，指出：半供给制仍然是社会主义性质的分配制度，它的工资和劳动奖励部分是根据按劳取酬的原则，根据劳力强弱、技术高低、劳动态度好坏来评定和实行的。但所有的人吃饭由公社供给，对丧失劳动力的老人的全部生活费用由公社供养，则已经超出按劳取酬的范围。随着生产的更大发展，实现了丰衣足食，就可以逐步实行全供给制。半供给制虽然还仅限于首先解决粮食供给问题，或解决某些人的最低限度的生活资料，但是它却已经包含了共产主义原则的萌芽。社论指出：半供给制这个分配制度的变革，必然促进生产力的进一步发展和人与人间的关系的重大变化。吃粮问题和养老抚幼问题的解决，使广大社员放下了养家糊口的重担，解除了后顾之忧，因而更能集中精力从事生产和学习文化技术。社论说：工资直接发给劳动者本人也会大大发挥劳动力的积极性，特别是青年和妇女的劳动积极性，破坏了旧社会遗留下来的家长制，更便于达到家庭的和睦和人与人之间的平等。
    社论批评了有些人耽心半供给制的实行会影响人们的劳动积极性。社论说，这是一种过低估计了劳动人民觉悟的不正确的思想。
  我国现实生活的特征社会主义制度加共产主义思想
    湖北省委的理论刊物“七一”在今天出的第四期上，发表了一篇题为“掀起一个大规模的共产主义思想运动”的文章，着重阐述了“社会主义制度加共产主义思想，是我国现实生活的特征”这个论点。文章指出，目前人们在处理劳动和报酬的关系问题时，还存在着两种不同的态度：一种是按酬付劳，这是我们应当不断批判的资本主义的劳动态度；另一种是自觉地“不拿报酬地为大家工作”（列宁语），这是我们应当大力提倡的共产主义的劳动态度。从“七一”第四期“共产主义的思想在成长”专栏和其他几篇文章中报道的新人新事，就可以看出对待劳动、对待集体的共产主义精神，正在渗透到我们劳动人民的各个方面，如果这些先进人物越来越多，那么我们的社会生产就会越发展越快。
    这篇文章批判了两种误解：一种是“认为共产主义就是在现有的物质基础上打乱平分”，一种是“认为现在是社会主义制度，不必去大力宣扬共产主义精神”。文章认为目前应该掀起一个大规模的共产主义思想运动，使人们在今天的社会主义制度下就要看到明天的美好的共产主义远景，为提前建成社会主义和逐步向共产主义过渡准备条件而奋斗。
    为共产主义思想呐喊
    今天（十月一日）出版的中共上海市委主办的理论刊物“解放”第七期，发表了一篇题为“平凡的人，不平凡的创造”的文章。文章介绍了上海耐酸搪瓷厂青年电焊徒工李志祥克服种种困难和危险试制出一种用石灰加其他原料而发生的电焊气体。文章中有李志祥说的一段十分感人的话，就是在试制石灰和其他燃料的混合燃烧气体发现有可能引起爆炸的危险时，李志祥就让老师傅离开，并对老师傅说：“你的家口多，我没啥负担，你的技术好，对国家的贡献更大，我是个学徒，即使出了事故对国家的损失也要小些”。这个杂志为此发表了题为“新的人，新的思想”的评论。评论指出：李志祥所以有这样崇高的共产主义感情，崇高的共产主义风格，就是因为他不是为了博取个人名利而工作，而是为国家、为人民、为社会主义工作，就是因为他有一种共产主义精神。
    评论指出：我们应当经常注意广大群众中所发生的这种共产主义思想因素，大张旗鼓地宣传、呐喊，用以进行共产主义教育，并和各种剥削阶级思想的残余影响作斗争。
