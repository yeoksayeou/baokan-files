    Hail to Everyone Becoming an Expert
    Ai Bei
    After reading the article "The Activities of the Twelve Families of Peasants" written by the Cheng Guan Town Committee of Fangcheng County, Communist Party of China, I felt as if I had entered a new and beautiful painting.
    Isn't this a new and beautiful painting? A town with a population of over 10,000 has twelve "families"—mass writers, inventors, scientists, literary figures, academics, singers, musicians, dramatists, painters, athletes, folk ballad singers, and folk dancers. They total 318 people, creating inventions, composing poems and paintings, writing books and establishing theories, singing and dancing... Truly, the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique talents; a hundred flowers blooming, a riot of color. They are making a big splash in Fangcheng Cheng Guan, active on all fronts of socialist construction, enriching the cultural life of the working people, and inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people.
    It should be pointed out here that these twelve families, 318 cultural vanguards, are not intellectuals who have received higher education, nor have they been inspired in an "ivory tower," nor have they been baptized in an "art palace." They are just ordinary working people and are engaged in labor. Culture and art originate from labor. Precisely because they are laborers, they can create culture and art, so that culture and art can take root and get rich nourishment in the soil of labor, create works that meet the needs of the working people, sing the heartfelt words of the working people, and be welcomed by the working people. The activities of these amateur cultural artists remind our professional literary and art workers how to better delve into life, go deep into reality, breathe the same air as the working people, work with them, and perfectly answer the demands of the working people. Didn't a poet write a poem about peasants hoeing seedlings in the rain with full vigor? The peasants laughed when they heard it, "Let him come and hoe, guaranteed to make it into a slurry!" This is unforgiving satire and a profound lesson. Shouldn't we wake up with a start!
    After the upsurge of economic construction arrives, the cultural upsurge will inevitably arrive. The twelve families of Fangcheng Cheng Guan are a wave in the cultural upsurge. The front wave carries the back wave, and the back wave pushes the front wave. We can look forward to the future, the near future, even now, the twelve families of Fangcheng Cheng Guan have increased from 318 to 629 people. Moreover, not only Fangcheng Cheng Guan, but in every Cheng Guan, every village, city, factory... a large number of various "families" are emerging every moment. The academic prosperity of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the rich and colorful "heyday of Tang," and the Renaissance of ancient Rome are nothing compared to our current cultural revolution! The sentence "Each generation produces talented people, each leading the way for hundreds of years" should be changed to "Talented people emerge everywhere, jointly leading the way for billions of years" in our era. Now is the era when the working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have become the masters of culture. The Party will cultivate these literary, artistic, and scientific workers to continuously improve and grow, improve on the basis of popularization, popularize under the guidance of improvement, and make our country's culture and art unprecedentedly prosperous.
    Our country is carrying out socialist construction, preparing conditions for the transition to communism. Carrying out cultural revolution, implementing the combination of education and productive labor, students are workers and also peasants; peasants are students, and workers are also students. In this way, the difference between mental and physical labor will be gradually eliminated, so that everyone can become an expert, and one person can not only become one expert, but also many. At that time, we will enter the newest and most beautiful painting depicted by our own hands. Let us all sing and advance vigorously!

    欢呼人人成家

    读了中共方城县城关镇委员会写的“农民十二家活动”的文章，仿佛进入了又新又美的画图中。
    这不是又新又美的画图吗？一个一万多人的城镇，就有了十二家——群众作家、发明家、科学家、文学家、学术家、歌唱家、音乐家、戏剧家、画家、体育家、民间说唱家、民间舞蹈家。他们共有三百一十八个人，创造发明，吟诗作画，著书立说，载歌载舞……真是八仙过海，各显神通，百花齐放，万紫千红。他们大闹方城城关，活跃在社会主义建设的各条战线上，丰富了劳动人民的文化生活，鼓舞了劳动人民的革命干劲。
    这里要指出的是，这十二家，三百一十八个文化尖兵，并不是受过高等教育的知识分子，并不曾在“象牙之塔”里得到灵感，也不曾在“艺术之宫”中受过洗礼。他们只是普通的劳动人民，且在从事劳动。文化艺术起源于劳动。正因他们是劳动者，所以才能创造文化艺术，才能使文化艺术扎根，在劳动的土壤中得到丰富的营养，作出适合劳动人民需要的创作，唱出劳动人民的心里话，受到劳动人民的欢迎。这些业余的文化艺术家的活动，提醒了我们的专业文学艺术家，应该怎样更好地深入生活，深入实际，同劳动人民同呼吸，同劳动，完满地回答劳动人民的要求。一个诗人不是写了农民鼓足干劲下雨天锄苗的诗吗？农民听了笑道，“让他来锄吧，包管和成稀泥浆！”这是不容情的讽刺，也是深刻的教训。难道还不应当猛醒么！
    在经济建设高潮到来之后，文化高潮就不可避免地到来了。方城城关十二家，是文化高潮中的一个浪头。前浪带后浪，后浪推前浪，我们可以憧憬到将来，不久的将来，就是现在，方城城关的十二家已经由三百一十八人增加到六百二十九人了。而且不仅方城城关，在每一个城关，每一个乡村、城市、工厂……都每时每刻地涌现大批各种各样的家。春秋战国的学术繁荣，“盛唐”之音的丰富多彩，古罗马的文艺复兴，比起我们现在的文化革命来说，不过是小巫见大巫罢了！“江山代有才人出，各领风骚数百年。”之句，到了我们的时代应当改成，“江山处处才人出，共领风骚亿万年。”现在是在共产党领导下的劳动人民做了文化的主人的时代。党将培养这些文学艺术科学家不断提高，不断成长，从普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及，使我国的文化艺术繁荣空前。
    我国正在进行社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义准备条件。进行文化革命，实行教育和生产劳动结合，学生是工人，又是农民；农民是学生，工人也是学生。这样，就将逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，使得人人成家，一人不仅成一家，而且可以成多家。那时，我们就将进入用自己双手所描摹的最新最美的画图中。让我们都来高歌猛进吧！
