Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 25th: The Soviet "Red Star" and "Air Force News" newspapers today published articles criticizing the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué.

"Red Star," in a commentary, stated that the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek communiqué can only be seen as the United States encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek clique to launch new provocations against China. The purpose of this communiqué is to attempt to justify US interference in China's internal affairs and its continued occupation of Taiwan.

The newspaper pointed out that Dulles, in Taiwan, confessed that his grandfather had participated in the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki between China and Japan after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. It was this treaty that allowed Japan to occupy Taiwan, and Dulles' grandfather played a role in this. The commentary said that now, Dulles is following in his grandfather's footsteps, wanting to make the United States permanently occupy Taiwan and preparing new provocations.

The "Air Force News" commentary said that the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek communiqué is a document filled with hatred for the Chinese people. The communiqué once again proves that Dulles and the group he represents stubbornly adhere to a policy of hostility and aggression towards China.

The commentary pointed out that Dulles is inheriting his grandfather's mantle, insisting that Taiwan, which has belonged to China since ancient times, does not belong to the Chinese people. However, now is not 1895, and a strong China and its armed forces are capable of crushing the enemy's sinister plans.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 25th: "Red Right News" today published a commentary on the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks, stating that the communiqué once again shows that the United States intends to continue its aggressive policy towards China.

The commentary condemned Dulles for going to Taiwan as an "arbitrator" and threatening China with war. The commentary emphasized that the determination of the Chinese people is unshakable, and the United States must stop interfering.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 25th: Today's Hindi daily "Hindustan Daily" commented on the US-Chiang talks, saying that the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs in the name of "defending the free world."

The newspaper emphasized that the United States must change its policy. The newspaper said: "The US policy towards China is fundamentally wrong, and this policy is the root cause of the disputes."

The newspaper said that China "cannot tolerate any hostile forces occupying the coastal islands. It cannot let this sword hang over its head forever."

The newspaper pointed out that Dulles' dream of re-enslaving the Chinese people is a pipe dream.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: Tokyo News: "Yomiuri Shimbun" commented on the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué, saying that the meeting did not eliminate the contradictions and dissatisfaction existing between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The newspaper commented that the three days of continuous talks in Taipei were merely to mend the increasingly obvious rift between the two. Although the talks have ended, "dissatisfaction still exists between them, and many issues remain to be resolved." In this regard, the commentary pointed out that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have "not completely consistent" attitudes on the Jinmen and Mazu issues.

The newspaper said that there is a "great possibility" that the rift between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique will further deepen. The newspaper believes that the reason why the communiqué emphasizes unity between the two is precisely because they express strong unease about this possibility.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th: London News: Some influential British newspapers, in commenting on the outcome of the Chiang Kai-shek-Dulles talks on the 24th, expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of any substantial change in US policy in the Taiwan Strait area.

The "Times" correspondent in Hong Kong said that the "small amount of results is surprising." The newspaper believes that in this meeting, even the hope of arranging a reduction in the Jinmen garrison in exchange for an increase in the supply of modern weapons was not achieved.

The Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" believes that "if the communiqué is taken at face value—or no value—the situation after the talks is exactly the same as before the talks—only more so."

The newspaper accused the United States of "what it seems to be planning to do on the issue of China's coastal islands is to exchange manpower for firepower. In diplomatic terms, such an approach is meaningless."

    美国侵略政策未改　美蒋矛盾未消
    各国报纸评论蒋杜会谈的结果
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联“红星报”和“空军报”今天发表文章，抨击杜勒斯和蒋介石会谈公报。
  　“红星报”在一篇评论中说，杜蒋会谈公报只能被认为是美国鼓励蒋介石集团对中国进行新的挑衅。这个公报的目的是力图为美国干涉中国内政及继续占领台湾的行为辩解。
    这家报纸提出，杜勒斯在台湾曾经供认说，他的外祖父曾经参加过1894至1895年中日战争以后的中日“马关条约”的签订。正是这个条约，使日本占领台湾，而杜勒斯的外祖父在这方面卖了力气。评论说，现在，杜勒斯在走着他的外祖父的路，想使美国永远占据台湾，并且准备着新的挑衅。
    “空军报”的评论说，杜蒋会谈公报是一个充满对中国人民仇恨的文件。公报又一次证明杜勒斯及其所代表的集团顽固地坚持敌视和侵略中国的政策。
    评论指出，杜勒斯继承着他的外祖父的衣钵，硬说什么自古属于中国的领土台湾不属于中国人民。但是，现在已不是1895年，强大的中国及其武装力量是能够粉碎敌人的罪恶计划的。
    新华社布拉格25日电　“红色权利报”今天就杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈发表评论说，会谈公报再次表明，美国打算继续奉行它对中国的侵略政策。
    评论谴责杜勒斯以“仲裁人”的姿态去到台湾，并且以战争对中国进行威胁。评论强调说，中国人民的决心是不可动摇的，美国必须停止干涉。
    新华社新德里25日电　今天的印地文日报“印度斯坦日报”就美蒋会谈发表评论说，美国正以所谓“保卫自由世界”为名而干涉中国内政。
    这家报纸强调指出，美国必须改变政策。报纸说：“美国的对华政策是根本错误的，这种政策是造成纠纷的根本原因。”
    这家报纸说，中国“不能容忍任何敌对力量占领沿海岛屿。它不能让这把剑永远悬挂在它的头上”。
    这家报纸指出，杜勒斯想要重新奴役中国人民是做白日梦。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：“读卖新闻”就杜勒斯和蒋介石会谈公报发表评论说，这次会议并没有消除美国同蒋介石集团之间存在的矛盾和不满。
    这家报纸评论说，连续在台北举行三天的会谈仅仅是为了弥补两者之间日益明显的裂痕。虽然会谈已经结束了，“但是它们之间仍然存在着不满，许多问题仍然有待解决。”评论在这方面指出了美国同蒋介石集团在金门和马祖问题上态度并“不完全一致”。
    这家报纸说，美国同蒋介石集团之间的裂痕有“很大的可能性”会进一步加深，报纸认为，会谈公报中所以这么强调两者之间的团结一致，正是因为他们对这种可能性表示强烈的不安。
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：一些有影响的英国报纸24日在评论蒋介石—杜勒斯会谈结果时对于美国在台湾海峡地区的政策没有任何实质上的改变表示不满。
      “泰晤士报”驻香港的记者说，会谈“成果之少是出奇的”。报纸认为，在这次会谈中，甚至连安排减少金门守军以换取增加现代化武器供应的希望也未能实现。
    保守党的“每日电讯报”认为，“如果按表面价值——或者没有价值——来看会谈公报，会谈后的局势和会谈以前一模一样——只不过更是如此而已”。
    这家报纸指责美国在中国沿海岛屿问题上“计划作的事情看来是用火力来交换人力，在外交方面，这样一种作法是毫无意义的”。
