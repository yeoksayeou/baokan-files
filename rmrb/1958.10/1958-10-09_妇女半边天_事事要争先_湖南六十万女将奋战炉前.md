Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 8th October: Hunan now has 600,000 women participating in iron and steel production, becoming an important force on the iron and steel front.

The women of Hunan proposed: "Women hold up half the sky, strive to be first in everything, learn the heroic spirit of Zhao Yiman and Liu Hulan, and use the heroic will of steel to make steel." They used facts to reverse some people's views that looked down on women. The "March 8th" women's furnace in Taxia Mountain Cooperative, Litian Township, Yizhang County, was built by eighteen women. When they started building it, some male comrades even ridiculed them. These eighteen women were determined to build the furnace well and produce iron. They didn't know how to mix materials and install the air pipes, so they humbly learned from the masters; if they couldn't lift the iron hook, they lifted it with two people; when their heads were dizzy from the heat, they wrapped them in towels, and when the towels got hot, they wet them and wrapped them again. Persisting in hard work for three days and nights, they finally produced 1,150 jin of molten iron. Now, all 62 women's furnaces in Shaoyang Prefecture that have been put into production can produce normally. The three "March 8th" women's iron-smelting blast furnaces in Quantang Cooperative, Baishuxia Township, You County, have also changed the manpower for the bellows to water power, saving labor and increasing the output of each furnace from the original 600 jin to more than 1,100 jin. Women also actively support iron and steel production in terms of raw materials, fuel, and transportation. Lianyuan County has transferred 51,000 female laborers to temporary transportation, and 6,000 women are engaged in fixed jobs such as hammering ore sand, coking coal, and carrying.

Many women have created moving model deeds in iron-smelting production. Qiu San'e, a seventeen-year-old girl from Shiniu Village, Daqiao Township, Lianyuan County, and a dozen other girls from her village, came to the iron factory construction site in July and actively participated in carrying earth and transporting coal. She got up before dawn and carried earth in the dark. While others rested at noon, she was still working, carrying more than 100 jin at a time, and carrying more than 8,000 jin in one day at most, surpassing strong male laborers. One night at the end of August, the factory needed coal. Regardless of the heavy rain, she voluntarily went with more than a dozen people to transport coal on the mountainside opposite, ensuring the normal production of the furnace.

### 妇女半边天　事事要争先  湖南六十万女将奋战炉前

    妇女半边天　事事要争先
    湖南六十万女将奋战炉前
    据新华社长沙8日电　湖南已有六十万妇女参加钢铁生产，成为钢铁战线上的一支重要的力量。
    湖南的妇女们提出：“妇女半边天，事事要争先，学习赵一曼、刘胡兰的勇敢精神，以钢铁的英雄意志来炼钢铁。”她们用事实扭转一些人瞧不起妇女的看法。宜章里田乡塔下山社“三八”妇女炉是由十八个妇女修起来的。在开始修建的时候，有些男同志还讽刺她们。这十八个妇女个个下定决心，一定要把炉修好，炼出铁来。她们不知如何配料安风管，就虚心向师傅学；通钩拿不起就两个人抬；头被烤昏了，就用手巾包起来，手巾热了打湿再包上。就是这样坚持苦干了三昼夜，她们终于炼出铁水一千一百五十斤。现在，邵阳专区已投入生产的六十二座妇女炉，都能正常生产。攸县柏树下乡泉塘社三座“三八”妇女炼铁高炉，还把鼓风箱的人力改为水力，节省了劳力，使每个炉子产量由原来六百斤提高到一千一百多斤。妇女们还积极从原料、燃料、运输等方面支援钢铁生产。涟源县抽调了五万一千个妇女劳动力投入临时运输，有六千个妇女担任捶矿砂、焦煤、搬运等固定工作。
    很多妇女在炼铁生产中创造了动人的模范事迹。涟源县大桥乡石牛村十七岁姑娘丘三娥和本村十几个姑娘，从7月来到铁厂工地，就积极参加挑土、运煤。她不等天亮就起来，摸黑挑土，中午别人休息时，她也在干，一挑总是一百多斤，最多一天挑了八千多斤，超过强壮的男劳动力。在8月底的一个夜晚，厂里需煤，她不顾大雨，自动和十几个人到对面山腰运煤，保证了炉子的正常生产。
