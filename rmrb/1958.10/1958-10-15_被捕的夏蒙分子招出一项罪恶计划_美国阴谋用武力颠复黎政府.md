Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 13th. "Al Anwar" newspaper published today details of a conspiracy against the current Lebanese government. A conspirator arrested in Saida (Sidon) confessed to the Chamoun group's sinister plan, supported by the United States, to create an "unforeseeable situation" in Lebanon and launch an armed coup in order to pave the way for the continued occupation of Lebanon by American invading forces.

This conspirator, named Saadeddine Hejazi, is a henchman of the National Socialist Party. He was arrested on the 11th in Sidon for attempting to assassinate Marouf Saad, a Lebanese parliamentarian and one of the leaders of the National Front. According to Hejazi's confession before the military court of the patriotic forces in Saida, he was instigated to do so by Assad Ashkar, the leader of the National Socialist Party.

According to Hejazi's confession: with Chamoun's approval, the National Socialist Party and the Phalangists colluded and reached an agreement on creating unrest in Lebanon. He confessed that Chamoun, together with Ashkar and Phalangist leader Gemayel, held a meeting in a village called Dik El Mehdi (not far from Chamoun's current residence), where Chamoun spoke of using shameless means such as kidnapping or assassinating leaders of the National Front to undermine the Lebanese national independence movement. Chamoun also said that he had "assured the American ambassador to Lebanon that he would continue to create tension in Lebanon so that the U.S. Sixth Fleet could easily find an excuse to stay."

Hejazi said that they also agreed on a plan to launch an armed coup:

1. To forcibly stage a general strike in the parts of Beirut they controlled and provoke religious disputes; 2. To issue National Socialist Party henchmen with weapons, explosives, and forged identity cards, and send them to various parts of Lebanon, instructing them to take "collective action" between October 20th and October 25th; 3. To continue contacting pro-Chamoun officers in order to finalize the armed coup plan; 4. To instigate certain aircraft of the Lebanese Air Force to bomb the bases of the supporters of the National Front in Saida, Tyre, Tripoli, and Baalbek; 5. To train certain Phalangist and National Socialist Party henchmen to carry out sabotage; 6. To contact the Israeli government and conclude an agreement to carry out military provocations in the area along the Lebanese-Israeli border a few days before the implementation of the armed coup, in order to divert attention, and to connect with pro-Chamoun army officers to send all Muslim officers to the Lebanese-Israeli border as a diversionary tactic. The conspirator Hejazi also confessed: "Chamoun told Ashkar and Gemayel that during his recent meeting with the American ambassador, the ambassador agreed to send American aircraft to participate in this operation, on the condition that they fly at night so that the American aircraft would not be easily identified."

    被捕的夏蒙分子招出一项罪恶计划
    美国阴谋用武力颠复黎政府
    新华社大马士革13日电　“光明报”今天刊载了一个反对黎巴嫩现政府的阴谋案的详情。一个在赛义达（西顿）被捕的阴谋分子供认了夏蒙集团在美国支持下企图在黎巴嫩制造“无法预料的局势”，并且发动武装政变，以便为美国侵略军继续占领黎巴嫩铺平道路的罪恶计划。
    这个阴谋分子名叫萨德丁·赫贾齐，是国家社会党的党棍。他是11日在西顿企图暗杀黎巴嫩议员、民族阵线领导人之一马鲁夫·萨德时被捕的。据赫贾齐在赛义达的爱国力量部队军事法庭上供认，这是国家社会党党魁阿萨德·阿什卡尔唆使他干的。
    据赫贾齐供称：在夏蒙的赞同下，国家社会党和长枪党的党徒们狼狈为奸，就黎巴嫩制造骚乱问题达成了协议。他供认，夏蒙同阿什卡尔和长枪党头目杰马耶勒曾经在一个叫做迪克马赫迪的村庄（离夏蒙现在住宅不远）里举行会议，夏蒙在会上谈到了采取绑架或暗杀民族阵线领袖们的无耻手段来破坏黎巴嫩的民族独立运动。夏蒙还说，他曾经向美国驻黎巴嫩大使“保证继续在黎巴嫩搞紧张，以便美国第六舰队能毫不费力地找到留下来的借口”。
    赫贾齐说，他们还商定了发动武装政变的计划：
    一、在他们控制的贝鲁特部分地区硬搞总罢工，并且挑起宗教纷争；二、发给国家社会党党徒们武器、炸药和伪造的身份证，把他们派往黎巴嫩各地，指示他们在10月20日至10月25日期间采取“集体行动”；三、继续同亲夏蒙的军官们接触，以便确定武装政变计划；四、唆使黎巴嫩空军的某些飞机轰炸赛义达、蒂雷、的黎波里和巴尔贝克等民族阵线的支持者们的基地；五、训练某些长枪党和国家社会党的党徒进行破坏工作；六、同以色列政府接洽并且订立协议，在实行武装政变前几天在黎以边境一带进行军事挑衅，以转移人们注意，并且同亲夏蒙的陆军军官连系，把所有穆斯林军官派到黎以边境以调虎离山。阴谋分子赫贾齐还供称：“夏蒙对阿什卡尔和杰马耶勒说，在他最近同美国大使会晤时，大使同意派美国飞机参加这一行动，条件是要在晚间飞行，以使美国飞机不易被人辨认出来。”
