Title: Khrushchev Refutes Eisenhower: US Interference in China's Internal Affairs Has Pushed the US to the Brink of Direct Military Conflict with the People's Republic of China. If the US Crosses This Brink, the Soviet Union Cannot Stand Idly By. However, We Have Not Interfered in the Chinese People's Civil War Against the Chiang Kai-shek Clique in the Past, Nor Are We Prepared to Interfere Now.

Xinhua News Agency, October 5th, TASS Moscow, October 5th: In view of some views expressed by US President Eisenhower at a press conference on October 1st, a TASS reporter asked Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev the following questions:

    US President Eisenhower insisted at a press conference on October 1st that the actions taken by the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan Straits area to liberate its territory, which has belonged to China since ancient times, from the Chiang Kai-shek elements, cannot be regarded as a civil war, that is, cannot be regarded as China's internal affairs. To justify this view, the President insisted: "If this is a civil war, then why did Russia say through Mr. Khrushchev in his letter that Russia is prepared to participate in this war? If this is a civil war, then this means that I do not fully understand the true meaning of this term."

    How should one assess the US President's view? As far as is known, none of the Soviet government's statements provide any basis for making this assertion.

    Below is Khrushchev's reply.

    I fully agree with the view that, at the aforementioned press conference, President Eisenhower made a completely incorrect interpretation of the Soviet government's statements on the Taiwan Straits situation, which are known to all. One can only be surprised by the impudent distortion of the Soviet position. It was never conceivable that anyone would use such tactics. I still believe that the US President will correctly understand our statements regarding the situation in the Taiwan Straits region. If anyone dares to distort the Soviet government's statements regarding the maintenance of peace in the Far East, then this only proves that those who adopt such tactics are by no means acting in the interests of peace, but rather for the interests of a narrow US group that is pursuing a policy of intensifying international tension and preparing for a new war in order to make a fortune.

    However, the obviously false statements made by some people in order to distort the Soviet position will not lead to the results that these people expect. The Soviet position is clear, consistent and affirmative. The Soviet government, for example, directly and explicitly stated in its letter to President Eisenhower that if the United States launches a war against our friend and ally, the People's Republic of China, then the Soviet Union will fully fulfill its obligations under the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance concluded with the People's Republic of China, and an attack on the People's Republic of China is an attack on the Soviet Union.

    Is there any hint here, as President Eisenhower said, that the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in China's civil war? No, we have always talked about something else; if the People's Republic of China is subjected to external aggression, specifically, if the People's Republic of China is subjected to aggression by the United States, the Soviet Union will assist it.

    The Soviet government believes it is necessary to issue this warning because a situation has developed in the Far East whereby US interference in China's internal affairs has pushed the US to the brink of direct military conflict with the People's Republic of China. If the US crosses this brink, the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by. However, we have not interfered in the Chinese people's civil war against the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the past, nor are we prepared to interfere now.

    It is the inalienable right of the people of every country to handle their own internal affairs according to their own will. The desire to recover the islands of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu (Matsu), which are part of its territory, and to liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is China's internal affair. As everyone knows, these territories belonged to China long before Columbus discovered the American continent. The US government's attempt to obstruct the Chinese people from carrying out the struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was driven out of the mainland, and to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating its territory, which has belonged to China since ancient times, is a crude and blatant interference in China's internal affairs by the United States.

    President Eisenhower prefers to remain silent on this point.

    Finally, I believe it is necessary to emphasize once again that the US government will bear extremely serious responsibility before the people of all countries and before history for all the consequences that will result from the United States' intolerable interference in China's internal affairs and the aggressive actions of the US armed forces in the Taiwan Straits region.

    赫鲁晓夫驳斥艾森豪威尔
    美国对中国内政的干涉已经把美国推上同中华人民共和国发生直接军事冲突的最边缘。如果美国越过这个边缘，那么苏联就不能袖手旁观。但是，对于中国人民为反对蒋介石集团而进行的内战，我们过去没有干涉过，现在也不准备干涉。
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：由于美国总统艾森豪威尔在10月1日记者招待会上所谈的一些看法，塔斯社记者向苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫提出下列问题：
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在10月
  1日记者招待会上硬说，中华人民共和国为了把自古以来属于中国的领土从蒋介石分子手中解放出来而在台湾海峡地区所采取的行动，不能被认为是内战，也就是说不能被认为是中国人民的内政。总统为了论证他的这种说法，硬说：“如果这是内战的话，那么为什么俄国通过赫鲁晓夫先生的口在他的信中说，俄国准备参加这个战争。如果这是内战的话，那么这就意味着，我完全不明白这个词汇的真正意义。”
    对美国总统的这种看法可以作怎么样的估计呢？就现在所知，苏联政府的声明中没有任何一个声明提供作出这种论断的任何根据。
    下面是赫鲁晓夫的答复。
    我完全同意这种看法：在上述记者招待会上，艾森豪威尔总统对大家都知道的、苏联政府就台湾地区局势问题所发表的声明，作了完全不正确的解释。对无礼歪曲苏联立场的作法，只能感到惊奇。从来不可能设想，竟有人使用这种手段。我现在仍然相信，美国总统该会正确理解我们关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明。假如竟然有人歪曲苏联政府关怀维护远东和平的声明，那么这只证明，采取这种手法的人决不是本着和平的利益，而是为了美国某个狭隘集团的利益，这个集团为了发财而执行着日益加剧国际紧张局势和准备新战争的方针。
    但是，某些人为了歪曲苏联的立场而采取的那种显然违背事实的说法，不会导致这种人所期望的结果。苏联的立场是明确的，一贯的和肯定的。苏联政府，比如说，在给艾森豪威尔总统的信中直接地、明确地说，如果美国对我们的朋友和盟国中华人民共和国发动战争的话，那么苏联将完全履行它根据同中华人民共和国缔结的友好同盟互助条约而承担的义务，对中华人民共和国的进攻也就是对苏联的进攻。
    这里难道有任何暗示，像艾森豪威尔总统说的那样，苏联准备参加中国的内战吗？没有，我们一向谈的是另外一回事；如果中华人民共和国遭到外来的进攻，具体地说，如果中华人民共和国遭到美国的进攻，苏联将援助它。
    苏联政府认为必须提出这种警告，因为远东已经形成这样一种局势，美国对中国内政的干涉已经把美国推上同中华人民共和国发生直接军事冲突的最边缘。如果美国越过这个边缘，那么苏联就不能袖手旁观。但是，对于中国人民为反对蒋介石集团而进行的内战，我们过去没有干涉过，现在也不准备干涉。
    按照自己的意志处理本国内政是每一个国家人民的不可剥夺的权利。收复本国岛屿金门和马祖以及解放台湾和澎湖列岛的愿望，是中国人民的内政。大家知道，这些领土早在哥伦布发现美洲大陆很久以前就属于中国。美国政府企图阻挠中国人民把同被赶出大陆的蒋介石集团的斗争进行到底，企图阻挠中国人民解放自古以来就属于中国的领土，这是美国对中国内战的粗暴的、公然干涉。
    艾森豪威尔总统对于这一点却宁愿只字不提。
    最后，我认为必须再一次着重指出，对于美国令人不能容忍地干涉中国内政的做法和美国武装力量在台湾海峡地区的侵略行动将导致的全部后果，美国政府将在各国人民面前、在历史面前负极其严重的责任。
