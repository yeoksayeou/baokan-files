    What Friends See
    Mosikefuwusiji, Head of the Soviet Journalists Delegation
    In the first two weeks since arriving in the People's Republic of China, the Soviet journalists delegation has visited many large, medium, and small enterprises, as well as many beautiful large cities. We have also been to people's communes in cities and rural areas and visited the high-yield rice experimental fields near Tianjin.

    Everywhere, whether in the cities, in industrial enterprises, in universities, or in people's communes, our delegation has witnessed the tremendous political and labor enthusiasm for building socialism, the fighting revolutionary spirit, the courageous and resolute style, and the determination of the people to defend their increasingly prosperous motherland from interference by the United States and any other imperialist robbers.

    Only a great and wise party that correctly reflects the interests of the working people can foster such political enthusiasm and such unity in carrying out China's socialist transformation. The Communist Party of China, which holds high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, is precisely such a great and wise party.

    Because the working masses are closely united around the Communist Party and because the Chinese people unanimously support the Party's general line, People's China is now developing its industry and agriculture at a high speed, achieving tremendous successes in improving the living standards of the broad working masses.

    On the afternoon of September 19th, we arrived at a coal mine not far from Fushun. This is an open-pit coal mine with large deposits of oil shale. The scale and resources of the Fushun mining area are in no way inferior to the world's largest mining areas.

    The extraction of coal and oil shale is increasing rapidly year by year in People's China. In 1957, the miners of Fushun produced 3.8 million tons of coal for the country, a record figure never achieved since the mining area began operations in 1914. But in 1958, the miners handed over 5.4 million tons of coal to the country. In 1957, 15.66 million tons of oil shale were extracted here, and in 1958, it is expected to reach 17.5 million tons.

    The entire production process in the mining area is mechanized. But the main driving force here, as in other parts of China, is the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working class.

    The old steel plant in China—Anshan Iron and Steel Company—can serve as a good example of progress and transformation. It is no longer appropriate to call it an old factory, as it has been rebuilt. During the Japanese occupation, the best time saw an annual output of 850,000 tons of iron and 830,000 tons of steel. Now, under a free life and free labor, under the leadership of their own excellent experts, the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are striving to produce 4.5 million tons of steel this year!

    Here is another example: the designed capacity of the seamless steel tube plant is 60,000 tons, and the steel tubes produced in 1958 will increase to 250,000 tons.

    The entire Chinese people are participating in solving the problem of increasing steel production. In addition to large and medium-sized steel plants and iron plants, numerous small blast furnaces have been built. According to newspaper reports, 5,000 such air-blown furnaces had been built by September, with a total volume of 38,000 cubic meters. Considering that Anshan has eight blast furnaces with a volume of 800 to 1,000 cubic meters, the 5,000 small blast furnaces are equivalent to 38 to 40 blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. But how many indigenous blast furnaces have the people built? It is truly difficult to calculate! To welcome the National Day, in Baoding city and its suburbs alone, 70,000 small blast furnaces were producing simultaneously on September 28, producing 3,000 tons of iron per day and night.

    The participation of the broad masses of the people in solving the problem of steel production will undoubtedly lead to a smooth solution. In 1952, China ranked eighteenth in the world in steel production, and now it ranks seventh. In another year or two, this seventh place will be left to some capitalist country, and China will advance greatly.

    Changing the attitude towards labor is one of the best signs of the socialist consciousness of the workers. Lenin once said that where workers are truly concerned about production and the results of their labor, socialism will develop. In China's factories and mines, we have encountered everywhere facts that illustrate the workers' close concern for the development of production and their own labor achievements. There are thousands of suggestions for improving production on big-character posters. Many of these suggestions have been adopted and implemented. New working methods have emerged, and labor productivity is increasing day by day. Lenin said that improving labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important thing in socialist construction.

    At the Shenyang Machine Tool Plant, we learned about a working method that is vividly called "ants gnawing at bones," where people use small lathes to manufacture the most modern large machines. This demonstrates the initiative and ingenuity of Chinese workers and red experts, and their revolutionary spirit of boldly advancing industrial production.

    In one factory, we saw a slogan: "Wisdom rivals Zhuge Liang, drive surpasses Wu Song." This slogan vividly expresses the excellent qualities of Chinese workers.

    It is probably unnecessary to talk to Chinese readers about agricultural achievements. Chinese readers who created these achievements know them better than we do. But what we have seen and heard in conversations with dozens of comrades is not only remarkable but also highly respectable, respecting those who have created heroic deeds. Hebei Province has always been at the mercy of nature. Drought or floods often turned the hard work of farmers into nothing. Now, under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the workers of this province are determined to fight against natural disasters. In just one year, the working people have basically completed large-scale water conservancy projects. Their labor results are as follows: in 1957, the irrigated area was 17 million mu, and in 1958, the irrigated area was expanded to 92.2 million mu. Countless reservoirs have been built in both mountainous and plain areas. The water that used to destroy fields is now under control. The land is no longer indebted to its new, true masters! 1957 was a bumper year, with grain harvests reaching 18.8 billion jin, but this year's summer harvest exceeded it by 78%. Now the average grain per person has reached more than 1,000 jin. The goal proposed by the farmers is to achieve an average harvest of 2,000 jin per person next year. This year's summer harvest has further encouraged the fighting spirit of the working people, and undoubtedly, they will achieve their goals.

    Cadres are also worthy of attention and cannot be left unmentioned. The cadres we met in factories, schools, Party committees, and newspaper editorial departments gave us the best impression. These people are politically well-trained, familiar with the situation, infinitely loyal to the people and the Communist Party, and they are full of determination to complete any task of the Party Central Committee.

    Our delegation thanks the cadres of Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Tianjin, and Baoding, who have extensively introduced the achievements of the urban and rural people to us and provided good working conditions for us Soviet journalists. We would also like to express our gratitude to the friends of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Journalists Association, and the "People's Daily" for the trips and fraternal care they organized for us.

    The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and between our two Communist Parties, has been developing and strengthening for many years. This friendship has not only opened our doors but also opened our hearts. The essence of this unbreakable friendship has been repeatedly mentioned in the speeches of Soviet government leaders and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Comrade Khrushchev, not long ago. He declared on behalf of the entire Soviet people to the American warmongers that infringing upon the People's Republic of China is an infringement upon the Soviet Union, and if the imperialists dare to provoke a war against People's China, then China will never be alone, our army, the entire strength of our great Soviet country, will be used against the imperialists.

    Our friendship, its strength and fortress are as solid as a rock, any provocation by the imperialists will be smashed to pieces, and any army of capitalist countries, even when combined, will certainly be smashed to pieces.

    There are no people in the world who love peace more than the Chinese and Soviet people, and there are no people who defend their achievements more bravely and heroically. The US imperialists, who are intensifying provocations and playing with fire, should not forget this.

    Long live the great friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union, which makes the enemy afraid and makes the working people of the world happy!

    朋友们所看到的
    苏联新闻工作者代表团团长　莫斯科伏斯基
    苏联新闻工作者代表团在来到中华人民共和国的头两个星期中，已经参观了许多大、中、小型的企业，参观了许多美丽的大城市。我们还到过城市和农村中的人民公社，参观了天津附近的水稻丰产试验田。
    无论在城市、在工业企业、在高等学校以及在人民公社中，我们代表团到处都看到建设社会主义的巨大的政治和劳动热情、战斗的革命精神、勇敢和坚决的作风，看到人民保卫日益繁荣的祖国不受美国和任何其他帝国主义强盗干涉的决心。
    使人民具有这样的政治热情，这样团结一致地从事中国的社会主义改造事业，只有正确地反映劳动人民利益的伟大而英明的党才能办到。高举马克思列宁主义战无不胜的旗帜的中国共产党，正是这样伟大而英明的党。
    由于劳动群众紧密地团结在共产党的周围，由于中国人民一致拥护党的总路线，人民中国现在正高速度地发展工业和农业，在提高广大劳动群众的生活福利方面达到巨大的成就。
    9月19日的下午，我们到了距抚顺不远的煤矿。这是一个露天煤矿，同时还有大量的油母页岩矿藏。抚顺矿区的规模和富源，一点也不逊于世界上最大的矿区。
    煤和油母页岩的开采，在人民中国是一年年迅速增加的。1957年抚顺的矿工们给国家生产了三百八十万吨煤，这是从1914年矿区开始采煤以来从未达到过的创纪录数字。但是1958年，矿工们交给国家五百四十万吨煤。1957年这儿开采的油母页岩是一千五百六十六万吨，1958年就要达到一千七百五十万吨。
    矿区的整个生产过程都是机械化的。但是这儿主要的动力，也同中国其他各地一样，是劳动群众的革命热情，是工人阶级的革命热情。
    中国的旧钢铁厂——鞍山钢铁公司可以作为前进和改造的一个很好的例子。现在叫它为旧工厂已经不对了，因为它已重新改建过。在日本人占领时期，开工最好的时候，达到年产八十五万吨铁，八十三万吨钢。现在，在自由的生活和自由的劳动下，在自己的优秀专家的领导下，鞍山钢铁公司工人生产的钢要在今年争取达到四百五十万吨！
    这里还有另外一个例子：无缝钢管厂的设计能力是六万吨，1958年制成的钢管将增加到二十五万吨。
    中国全体人民都参加到解决增产钢铁的问题中来了。除大型和中型炼钢厂和炼铁厂外，建造了许许多多的小高炉。据报纸报道，这种用空气鼓风的炉子在9月以前就已建起了五千个，它们的容积共三万八千立方公尺。如果考虑到鞍山有八个高炉，容积是从八百立方公尺到一千立方公尺，那么五千个小高炉就等于鞍山钢铁公司的三十八到四十个高炉。可是人民还建起了多少个土高炉啊，真是难以计算！为了迎接国庆，仅在保定一个城市及其郊区，9月28日就有七万个小高炉在同时生产，每昼夜出铁三千吨。
    广大人民参加解决钢铁生产问题，无疑会使问题顺利解决。1952年，中国在钢铁生产方面占世界第十八位，而现在它已占第七位。再过一两年，这个第七位将留给某个资本主义国家，而中国将大大前进。
    改变对劳动的态度，是劳动者社会主义觉悟最好的标志之一。列宁曾经说过，哪里出现工人真正关心生产、关心自己的劳动结果，哪里的社会主义就会发展。在中国的工厂和矿山，我们到处都遇到说明工人密切关心生产的发展、关心自己劳动成就的事实。大字报上有数以千计的改善生产的建议。其中许多建议已经采用，已经实现。一些新的工作方法诞生了，劳动生产率日益增长。列宁说过，提高劳动生产率，归根结底，是社会主义建设中最重要的事情。
    在沈阳机床厂我们了解到一个被形象地叫做“蚂蚁啃骨头”的工作方法，人们用小车床制造最现代化的大机器。这表示出中国工人和红色专家的主动性和机智，表示出他们那大胆推进工业生产的革命精神。
    在一个工厂中我们看到了这样的标语：才智赛诸葛，干劲盖武松。这个标语形象地表达了中国工人的优秀品质。
    大概不需要向中国读者谈农业方面的成就了。创造这些成就的中国读者比我们了解得更清楚。但是我们看到的和同几十位同志交谈中所听到的，却不只是值得注意，而是非常值得尊敬，尊敬那些创造了英雄事业的人们。河北省过去总是受老天爷的欺负的，干旱或涝灾时常使农民的辛勤劳动化为乌有。现在这个省的劳动者在中国共产党省委会的领导下，决心同自然灾害作斗争。仅仅在一年之间，劳动人民就基本上完成了大规模水利工程。他们的劳动成果是这样的：1957年水浇地为一千七百万亩，1958年的灌溉田地就扩及到九千二百二十万亩了。无论山区和平原，都建筑了无数水库。那些过去冲毁田地的水，如今被控制住了。土地不再有负于新的真正的主人了！1957年是个丰收年，谷物的收成达到一百八十八亿斤，但是今年的夏收却超过它78％。现在谷物平均每人已达到一千斤以上。农民提出的目标是明年收成要使每人平均达到二千斤。今年夏季的丰收更鼓舞了劳动人民的战斗精神，无疑，他们会达到他们的目标的。
    干部也是不能不使人注意，不能不谈到的。我们在工厂、学校、党委会和报纸编辑部遇到的干部，都给了我们最好的印象。这些人都是政治修养好、熟悉情况，无限忠诚于人民和共产党的，他们充满了完成党中央任何任务的决心。
    我们代表团感谢沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、天津、保定的干部们，他们曾广泛地把城乡人民的成就介绍给我们，给我们苏联新闻工作者安排了很好的工作条件。我们也要对外交部新闻司、记者协会和“人民日报”的朋友们为我们组织的旅行和兄弟般的关怀，表示谢意。
    在中苏两国人民之间，在我们两国的共产党之间，兄弟般的友谊多年来一直发展和巩固着，这种友谊不仅打开了我们的房门，而且打通了我们的心。这种牢不可破的友谊的本质，在苏联政府领袖和苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫同志不久以前的讲话中，都曾经一再谈到。他代表全苏联人民向美国战争挑拨者宣布，侵犯中华人民共和国就是侵犯苏联，如果帝国主义者胆敢挑起对人民中国的战争，那么中国决不是孤独的，我国军队、我们伟大的苏维埃国家的全部力量，都将用来反对帝国主义者。
    我们的友谊，它的力量和堡垒坚如磐石，任何帝国主义者的挑衅都将碰得粉碎，任何资本主义国家的军队，甚至它们加在一起，都一定会碰得粉碎。
    世界上没有比中国人民和苏联人民更爱和平的了，没有更勇敢和这样英勇地保卫自己的成果的人民了。加强挑衅和玩火的美帝国主义者不应忘记这一点。
    使敌人害怕、使全世界劳动者高兴的中苏两国伟大人民的伟大友谊万岁！
