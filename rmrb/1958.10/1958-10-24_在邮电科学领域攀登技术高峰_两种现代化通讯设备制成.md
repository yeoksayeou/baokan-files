    Reaching Technical Peaks in the Field of Postal and Telecommunications Science
    Two Modern Communication Devices Developed
    With the 60/120-Channel Microwave Radio Relay Equipment, Only One Staffed Hub Station is Needed Every 500 Kilometers for Control
    With the Crossbar Semi-Automatic Cordless Toll Switchboard, Operators are Freed from the Busy Work of Plugging and Unplugging Cords

    (Our Dispatch) Two modern, cutting-edge telecommunications devices – the 60/120-channel microwave radio relay equipment and the crossbar semi-automatic cordless toll switchboard – have recently been successfully developed in Beijing.

    The 60/120-channel microwave radio relay equipment is the result of collaboration between five units: the Design Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Beijing Equipment Factory of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Tsinghua University, the Ministry of Railways, and the Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Because it can simultaneously transmit 120 telephone channels in conjunction with two K60-type carrier machines, the widespread adoption of this equipment will fundamentally change the technical landscape of China's existing communication facilities. The characteristics of this equipment are: 1. High efficiency and lower cost than ordinary carrier machines; 2. Significant savings in copper wire compared to ordinary wired long-distance equipment in trunk lines; 3. Due to the use of radio wave transmission, it is easier to traverse lakes and bays, and the geographical limitations are much smaller than those of wired long-distance equipment; 4. Simple remote control equipment: using an automatic remote control device, only one staffed hub station is needed every 500 kilometers for control.

    This microwave communication equipment can also transmit one channel of high-quality black-and-white television after a modification of the amplifier panel.

    The crossbar semi-automatic cordless toll switchboard is a collaborative effort between the Design Institute of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Changchun Equipment Factory. Like the microwave equipment above, it was completed by overcoming many specific design and manufacturing difficulties under conditions where there were neither prototypes nor complete technical data and sufficient materials and equipment. When this equipment is formally installed in cities with busy domestic circuits, the operator only needs to press two buttons to automatically connect the calling user to the required outbound circuit. By pressing the buttons in sequence according to the called user's telephone number, it can directly connect to the called user's automatic telephone, without requiring the participation of long-distance operators from other locations in the circuit connection work. It can also perform the various functions of ringing, forced disconnection, and release that a remote toll switchboard should have. The features of this equipment are that operators are freed from the busy work of plugging and unplugging cords, the connection time is greatly shortened, and the management personnel of the remote toll switchboard are also saved.

    在邮电科学领域攀登技术高峰
    两种现代化通讯设备制成
    有了60／120路微波机每五百公里只要一个有人管理的枢纽站控制
    有了纵横制半自动无绳长途台，话务员可以免除接拆塞绳的繁忙劳动
    本报讯  两种现代化的尖端技术通讯设备——60／120路微波无线电接力设备和纵横制半自动无绳长途台最近已在北京先后诞生了。
    60／120路微波无线电接力设备是邮电部设计院、邮电部北京器材厂、清华大学、铁道部和邮电部基建总局等五个单位的协作结晶。由于它能够配合K60型载波机二部同时传送120路电话，在大量采用这种设备以后，将从根本上改变我国原有通讯设备的技术面貌。这一设备的特点是：1、效率高、成本比一般载波机低；2、在干线设备上比一般有线长话设备可节省大量铜线；3、由于利用无线电波传输，便于通过湖泊海湾，地理上的局限性比有线长途设备也要小得多；4、遥控设备简单，利用自动遥控装置，每五百公里只需一个有人管理的枢纽站控制。
    这种微波通讯设备在改装一个放大盘以后，还可以传送一路高质量的黑白电视。
    纵横制半自动无绳长途台是邮电部所属设计院和长春器材厂两个单位协作试制成功的。它和以上微波设备一样，也是在既缺乏样机，又没有完整的技术资料和充分的材料设备的条件下，克服了设计和制造上许多具体困难而完成的。这一设备如正式安装在国内电路的业务繁忙的城市使用时，话务员只要按动两个键钮就可以把呼叫用户自动接续到需要通话的外地电路上去，再按照被叫用户的电话号码，依次按动键钮，就可以直接接通被叫用户的自动电话话机，不需要外地长途台值机员参加电路接续工作，同样能完成对方长途台应有的振铃，强拆和释放的各种作用。这一设备的特点是话务员可以免除接拆塞绳的繁忙劳动，接续时间大大缩短，同时又能节省外地长途台的管理人员。（附图片）
