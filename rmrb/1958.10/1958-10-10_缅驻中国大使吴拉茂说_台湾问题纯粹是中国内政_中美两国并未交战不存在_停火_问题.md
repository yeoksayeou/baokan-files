Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 8th. Myanmar Ambassador to China, U Hla Maw, told reporters in Hong Kong today that negotiations between China and the Chiang Kai-shek group are the best way to resolve the Taiwan issue.

U Hla Maw pointed out that there is no issue of a "ceasefire" between China and the United States because the two countries are not at war.

U Hla Maw said: "Internationally, it is known that Taiwan belongs to China, therefore the Taiwan issue is purely an internal affair." He emphasized that any foreign troops stationed in other countries would complicate the situation, and in order to simplify the situation, foreign troops should withdraw.

He further pointed out that if foreign troops withdraw and allow the Chinese to negotiate on their own, the tension in the Taiwan Strait can be eliminated.

The Myanmar Ambassador, along with his wife and four children, arrived here today from Guangzhou on their way back to their country.

    缅驻中国大使吴拉茂说
    台湾问题纯粹是中国内政
    中美两国并未交战不存在“停火”问题
    新华社香港8日电　缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂今天对香港的记者们说，中国和蒋介石集团之间举行谈判是解决台湾问题的最好办法。
    吴拉茂指出，不存在中国和美国之间“停火”的问题，因为两国并没有交战。
    吴拉茂说：“国际上都知道，台湾属于中国，因此台湾问题纯粹是内政。”他强调说，任何驻在其他国家的外国军队都会使情况更加复杂，为了使局势简化，外国军队应当撤退。
    他进一步指出，如果外国军队撤退，让中国人自行谈判，台湾海峡的紧张局势可以消除。
    缅甸大使同他的夫人和四个孩子在返国途中，今天从广州抵达这里。
