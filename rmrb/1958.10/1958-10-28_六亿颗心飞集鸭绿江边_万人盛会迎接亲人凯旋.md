Xinhua News Agency, Andong, October 27th: The Chinese people held a welcome rally of more than 10,000 people in Andong this morning to welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers' homecoming delegation and warmly welcome the returning officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

The venue for the rally was decorated solemnly and grandly. On the rostrum, the national flags of China and North Korea and portraits of Chairman Mao and Premier Kim Il-sung were hung high. At the entrance to the venue, a majestic and tall colorful archway stood, and there were pine tree arches on both sides of the rostrum. Four rows of huge slogan signs were erected around the venue, such as "Long Live the Militant Friendship Forged in Blood Between the Chinese and Korean Peoples" and "We Must Liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu."

At 9:20, the conference was announced to begin. At this time, firecrackers, gongs, and drums sounded throughout the venue, along with enthusiastic cheers. Children released balloons of various colors. More than 300 children ran onto the rostrum to present flowers to the officer and soldier representatives of the Volunteer Army Headquarters.

After the military band played the national anthems of China and North Korea, Liao Chengzhi, head of the Chinese People's Welcome Delegation for the Return of the Volunteers, delivered a welcome speech. He first extended a warm welcome to the "most beloved people" returning home in triumph on behalf of the Communist Party of China, various people's organizations, and various democratic parties. He said that our country's 650 million people extend the highest respect, the warmest welcome, and the most sincere greetings to the heroes of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

He said that the victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples fighting side by side and defeating the aggressor army headed by US imperialism disrupted the US's aggressive plan to dominate the world. This victory most vividly proves a truth, that is, the power of the people is invincible, US imperialism can be completely defeated, and any oppressed nation, as long as it dares to rise up and wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against the aggressors, will surely be able to obtain the final victory.

Liao Chengzhi said that the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers most vividly demonstrates the sincere peace of the Chinese and Korean peoples and their firm confidence in safeguarding the cause of peace. However, the troops of the US aggressors are still赖 (lai - depend on) staying in southern Korea. He said: "We want to warn the US aggressors and their accomplices: it is impossible for you to赖 (lai - depend on) stay here. If you do not withdraw your troops from southern Korea for one day, you will always be passive. If you dare to undermine the armistice agreement and re-launch a war of aggression, then, as long as the Korean people think it is necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters to cross the Yalu River again and give the aggressors a devastating blow together with the Korean people."

After Liao Chengzhi introduced the tremendous changes that have taken place in the motherland in the past eight years to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army, he said that the glorious posts of building a great motherland and completing the great cause of the motherland's reunification are waiting for you. The people of the whole country will work hard to learn and carry forward your fearless spirit of enduring hardship and difficulty, and learn and carry forward your heroic spirit and great internationalism and patriotism.

Wen Zaizhu, Counselor of the Korean Embassy in China, said in his welcoming speech that the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army thoroughly exposed the so-called "powerful" United States as nothing more than a paper tiger in front of the people of the world. The great achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Battle of Yunshan, the Battle of Shangganling, and many other battles will be forever praised by the Korean people for generations to come.

Che Xiangchen, member of the Welcome Delegation for the Return of the Volunteers and Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, and Duan Yongjie, Secretary of the CPC Andong Municipal Committee and Mayor of Andong City, also spoke on behalf of the people of Liaoning Province and Andong City respectively, warmly welcoming the victorious return of the Volunteers and expressing their sincere greetings to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteers.

General Yang Yong, Commander of the Volunteer Army, delivered a reply in warm applause, thanking the kinsmen of the motherland for their grand welcome on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said that the fact that the Volunteers were able to make any small contribution in the eight-year War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea was ultimately due to the support and encouragement of the people of the motherland.

Commander Yang Yong said that the eight years the Volunteers spent in Korea was only a brief moment in history, but huge changes have taken place in these eight years. Today, the motherland has stepped onto the great era where one day equals twenty years. Now, the economic and defense strength of China and North Korea are much stronger than they were eight years ago. In the past, the US aggressors, under more favorable conditions, still had to end in their own defeat. If they forget the lessons of the defeat in the Korean War and want to take risks again when the conditions in all aspects are greatly unfavorable to them today, a more tragic defeat is waiting for them. General Yang Yong solemnly warned the US warmongers: Now is the time for the US imperialists to learn from historical lessons and recognize the current situation. They should honestly withdraw their invading troops from southern Korea and from our country's Taiwan and Penghu as soon as possible, otherwise they will be subject to the ruthless punishment of history.

General Yang Yong's emotional, resolute, and powerful speech was constantly interrupted by cheers.

The welcome rally ended in the magnificent sound of the "Volunteer Army March." (Attached picture)

    六亿颗心飞集鸭绿江边
    万人盛会迎接亲人凯旋
    新华社安东27日电　中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团今天上午在安东举行一万多人的欢迎大会，热烈欢迎中国人民志愿军归国官兵。
    大会会场布置得庄严隆重。主席台上，高挂中朝两国国旗和毛主席、金日成首相的画像。会场大门，矗立着雄伟的高大彩牌楼，主席台两侧还有松树彩门。会场四周树立着“中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁”、“一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖”等四排巨大标语牌。
    九时二十分，大会宣布开始。这时，全场响起鞭炮、锣鼓声和热烈的欢呼声。孩子们放出了各种颜色的气球。三百多个孩子，跑上主席台把鲜花献给志愿军总部的官兵代表。
    军乐队奏完中朝两国国歌以后，中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团团长廖承志致欢迎词。他首先代表中国共产党、各人民团体、各民主党派，热情地欢迎“最可爱的人”凯旋归国。他说，我们祖国六亿五千万人民，向中国人民志愿军英雄们致以最崇高的敬意，最热烈的欢迎和最亲切的慰问。
    他说，中朝两国人民并肩作战，打败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军的胜利，打乱了美国称霸世界的侵略计划。这一胜利，最生动地证明了一条真理，那就是人民的力量是不可战胜的，美帝国主义是完全可以被打败的，任何被压迫的民族，只要敢于起来向侵略者进行坚决的、不屈不挠的斗争，就一定能够获得最后的胜利。
    廖承志说，中国人民志愿军完全实现撤军计划，最生动地表明了中朝两国人民和平诚意和维护和平事业的坚强信心。但是，美国侵略者的军队至今还赖在朝鲜南部不走。他说：“我们要警告美国侵略者和他的帮凶：你们赖在这里是不行的，你们一天不从朝鲜南部撤兵，你们就会永远被动下去。如果你们胆敢破坏停战协定，重新发动侵略战争，那么，只要朝鲜人民认为需要，中国人民就会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再次跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民一起给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。”
    廖承志向志愿军官兵介绍了祖国八年来巨大变化的情况以后说，建设伟大祖国和完成祖国统一大业的光荣岗位，在等待着你们。全国人民将要努力学习和发扬你们的不怕艰苦、不怕困难的大无畏精神，学习和发扬你们的英雄气概和伟大的国际主义和爱国主义精神。
    朝鲜驻中国大使馆参赞文在洙在致欢迎词时说，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在全世界人民面前彻底揭穿了所谓“强大”的美国，只不过是一个纸老虎。在云山战役、上甘岭战役以及其他许许多多的战役中，中国人民志愿军所建立的伟大功勋，朝鲜人民子孙万代将永远传颂下去。
    欢迎志愿军归国代表团团员、辽宁省副省长车向忱，中共安东市委书记、安东市市长段永杰也分别代表辽宁省和安东市人民讲话，热情地欢迎志愿军胜利归来，并向志愿军官兵表达了亲切慰问的心意。
    志愿军司令员杨勇上将在热烈的掌声中致答词，他代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵，感谢祖国亲人的盛大欢迎。他说，志愿军能够在八年抗美援朝的斗争中，作出任何一个微小的贡献，归根结底无一不是来自祖国人民的支援和鼓舞。
    杨勇司令员说，志愿军在朝鲜的八年，在历史上不过是一个短暂的时刻，但是这八年中却发生了巨大的变化。今天，祖国已经跨上了一天等于二十年的伟大时代。现在，中朝两国的经济力量和国防力量，已比八年前强大得多了。过去，美国侵略者在较为有利的条件下，仍然不得不以自己的失败而告终，那么，今天各方面条件已大大对它不利的时候，它如果忘掉朝鲜战争失败的教训，还想再度冒险的话，更惨重的失败正在等待着它们。杨勇上将郑重警告美国战争狂人：现在是美帝国主义者吸取历史教训，认识当前时务的时候了。应该老老实实把侵略军从朝鲜南部，从我国台湾、澎湖早日撤出去，否则必将受到历史的无情惩罚。
    杨勇上将充满感情、坚决有力的讲话，时时被欢呼声打断。
