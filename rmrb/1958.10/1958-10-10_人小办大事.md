    Small People Accomplish Big Things
    Yi Heyuan
    We often say that children are the successors to socialism, the flowers of humanity. But who would have thought that children are also constantly creating miracles in the great cause of building socialism? Our children are no longer babies with “baby teeth not yet fallen out and downy hair not yet shed.” Like newborn calves, they are full of vigor, just like adults, and use their actions to force adults to change their old views. The article “Six, Seven, Eight” vividly reflects this fact.
    Three six-, seven-, and eight-year-old children from the Yicheng County State Farm in Hubei Province, with the help of adults, cultivated a test plot and achieved a yield of 6,253 jin of rice per mu, which was twice the farm's per-mu yield. This made their elders admire them wholeheartedly and encouraged themselves to say: We shouldn't lose to the children!
    It is truly a miracle that small people can accomplish big things. The reason why small people can accomplish big things is not because these children have any special abilities or profound knowledge, but because they work hard, learn from adults, and overcome difficulties. More importantly, they, like adults, have the idea of contributing to the cause of socialism and possess a spirit of daring to think and act, which is the communist style—although they may not fully understand this truth. Since the Great Leap Forward, everyone has been full of energy, and communist ideas have blossomed everywhere. This has even infected the children. Creating the miracle of more than 6,000 jin per mu is very valuable, but I think what is even more valuable is that they have such noble ideas at such a young age. It is conceivable that these successors, under the Party's constant cultivation and education, will do earth-shattering things in the future!
    "We shouldn't lose to the children!" The people of Yicheng State Farm use this sentence to encourage themselves and express their intention to learn from and emulate the six-, seven-, and eight-year-olds. This spirit is very good. Indeed, we adults are much more mature than children in all aspects and should be role models for the next generation, making leap after leap. It is always unacceptable to "lose to the children."
    However, there are some people who seem to be "losing to the children." They claim to be experts, with "knowledge" and "learning," and stubbornly cling to their own ways, refusing to reform their thinking. They also look down on young people, saying, "What can these young children accomplish?" They want "adults to accomplish big things," to make a splash and gain both fame and fortune. They are unwilling and disdainful to do so-called "small things," fearing that they will lose face if they don't do them well. As a result, they sit in their studies and achieve nothing. On the other hand, the young children they look down upon, because they don't have those dirty ideas of fame and fortune, dare to think and act, constantly invent and create, and make great contributions to the country, making their teachers pale in comparison.
    It seems that the problem is very clear: if you don't transform your thinking, if you don't pull down the white flag and raise the red flag, you won't be able to accomplish big things, and you won't even be able to do small things well. As the saying goes, "Ambition has nothing to do with age, and being a hundred years old without talent is useless." Today, if you don't have communist aspirations and ideas, you are sure to accomplish nothing and "lose to the children."

    人小办大事
    易和元
    我们常说儿童是社会主义的接班人，是人类的花朵。但是谁会想到在建设社会主义的伟大事业中，儿童也不断地创造出奇迹呢？我们的孩子们，已经不再是“乳牙未退，胎毛未干”的娃娃了，他们像初生牛犊，同大人一样地干劲冲天，并且用行动迫使大人们改变自己的旧看法。“六、七、八”这篇文章就生动地反映了这么一个事实。
    湖北宜城县国营农场三个六、七、八岁的小娃娃，在大人的帮助下搞了一块试验田，竟然亩产稻谷六千二百五十三斤，高出农场的亩产量两倍，使得长辈们也佩服得五体投地，并勉励自己说：总不应当输给娃娃们吧！
    人小办大事，确是奇迹。人小之所以能办大事，并不是这些娃娃们有什么特别的本领，高深的学问，而在于他们努力向大人学习，艰苦工作，克服困难；更主要的还在于他们和大人们一样，具有为社会主义事业尽力的思想，具有一种敢想敢做的共产主义风格——虽然他们不一定十分懂得这个真理。大跃进以来，人人干劲冲天，共产主义思想遍地开花，这连小孩子们也感染到了。创造亩产六千多斤的奇迹，这非常可贵，然而我认为更为可贵的是，这样小小的年纪就具有这么高贵的思想。可以想像得到，这些接班人在党的不断培养教育下，将来会做出什么惊天动地的事来！
    “总不应当输给娃娃们吧”，宜城国营农场的人们用这句话来勉励自己，并表示要向六、七、八学习，看齐，这种精神是很好的。的确，我们成年人在各方面都比小孩成熟得多，应当做下一代的榜样，跃进再跃进，“输给娃娃们”总是说不过去的。
    然而有这么一些人，看来是会“输给娃娃们”的。他们自命是专家，有“学问”，有“知识”，老抱着自己的一套不放，不肯改造思想，而又看不起年轻人，说：“这些年轻娃娃搞得出什么名堂”，他们要“大人办大事”，要一鸣惊人，名利双收。他们不愿也不屑去办所谓“小事”，怕做不好，反而丢了人。结果呢，他们是苦坐书斋，一事无成。而被他们看不起的年轻娃娃呢，就因为没有那些肮脏的名利思想，敢想敢干，不断发明创造，给国家作出了很大的贡献，使老师们相形见拙。
    看来问题是很清楚的，不改造思想，不拔掉白旗插上红旗，非但大事办不成，小事也办不好。俗话说：“有志不在年高，无才空长百岁”，在今天，如果没有共产主义的志向和思想，就准会一事无成，“输给娃娃们”的。
