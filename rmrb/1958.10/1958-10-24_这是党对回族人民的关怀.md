    This is the Party's Concern for the Hui People
    Jin Zilin, Production Team Leader of Hanjiaoshui People's Commune, Tongxin County
    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is about to be established. This is another instance of the Party and Chairman Mao's meticulous care and love for us Hui people.
    Under the oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang and Ma Hongkui's bandit gang, the Hui people in our Ningxia region were displaced and their fields lay barren, resulting in a scene of "nine out of ten villages empty." Since liberation, our Hui people have not only gained political equality, but also rapid development and improvement in production and life. Take our team as an example: before liberation, we had only 74 mu of irrigated land, but now it has expanded to more than 3,000 mu. Grain output has increased fourfold compared to last year, and the lives of every household have undergone earth-shaking changes. Personally, I was a poor peasant before liberation. After liberation, under the cultivation of the Party, I became the director of the agricultural cooperative and was elected as a people's representative of the county, province, and region. Last year, I also attended the National Model Agricultural Laborers' Conference and met the great leader Chairman Mao in Beijing. Whenever I think of these things, my heart is filled with endless gratitude. We deeply realize that without the Communist Party, there would be no happy life for our Hui people.

    这是党对回族人民的关怀
    同心县喊叫水人民公社生产队长　金自林
    宁夏回族自治区将要成立了，这是党和毛主席对我们回族人民，又一次无微不至的关怀和爱护。
    我们宁夏地区的回族人民，在国民党和马鸿逵匪帮的压迫和剥削下，人们流离失所，田地荒芜，形成“十庄九空”的景象。解放以后，我们回族人民不仅在政治上得到平等，生产和生活也得到很快的发展和提高。就以我们队来说，解放前只有七十四亩水地，现在已发展到三千多亩，粮食产量比去年提高了四倍，家家户户的生活都有天翻地复的变化。以我个人来说，解放前是一个贫农。解放后在党的培养下，当了农业社主任，被选为县、省、区的人民代表，去年还出席了全国农业劳动模范代表会议，在北京会见了伟大的领袖毛主席。每当我想起这些事情，心里总是感激不尽。我们深深体会到：没有共产党，就没有我们回族人民的幸福生活。
