Serving Production, Serving Farmers

Czechoslovakia Sends Over 40,000 Agricultural Experts to the Countryside

A large number of agricultural experts in Czechoslovakia, responding to the call of the Party and the government, have gone deep into the countryside to participate in agricultural production, closely combining theory and practice. Currently, 46,000 agricultural experts are working in agricultural cooperatives, pastures, and machine tractor stations.

In order to fulfill the task of increasing agricultural production by 40% by 1965, raising the level of production technology has become an important issue in agricultural production. To change the past shortcomings of most agricultural experts being detached from reality, Czechoslovakia this year criticized the idea of being attached to urban life and unwilling to approach agricultural production, put forward the slogan "Agricultural experts go to the countryside," and pointed out that this is the only correct path for agricultural experts to serve agricultural production. In addition, the government has also decided that from now on, graduates of agricultural colleges must first go to the countryside for internships, two-thirds of whom will participate in the work of unified agricultural cooperatives. Three-quarters of agricultural experts will directly participate in agricultural production in accordance with the national plan.

Although the work of agricultural experts going to the countryside has just begun, facts have proven that they have played a good role in improving production technology. At the same time, facts have also proven that agricultural experts can better use their knowledge only in the fields, in the pasture sheds, and at the tractor stations. Farmers in states such as Olomouc and Pilsen believe that the technical guidance of agricultural experts is very helpful for improving their production.

While agricultural experts are being sent to the countryside, the Czechoslovak Party and government are also taking various measures to improve the theoretical and technical levels of farmers with rich production experience and train them to become experts. For example, they are opening one-year training courses for them and sending a large number of young farmers to agricultural technical schools or agricultural universities to study.

    为生产服务　为农民服务
    捷四万多农业专家下放农村
    捷克斯洛伐克有大批农业专家响应党和政府的号召，深入农村，参加农业生产，使理论和实践密切结合起来。目前已有四万六千名农业专家在农业合作社、牧场、机器拖拉机站工作。
    为了完成到1965年把农业生产提高40％的任务，提高生产技术水平成为农业生产中一个重要问题。为了改变过去大部分农业专家脱离实际的缺点，捷克斯洛伐克今年批判了那种留恋城市生活，不愿接近农业生产的思想，提出了“农业专家下农村”的口号，并且指出，这是农业专家为农业生产服务的唯一正确的道路。此外，政府还决定，今后农学院的毕业生都必须首先到农村去实习，其中三分之二将参加统一农业合作社的工作。四分之三的农业专家都将按照国家计划，直接参加农业生产。
    农业专家下放农村的工作虽然还刚刚开始，但是，事实证明，他们在提高生产技术方面已经发挥了良好的作用。同时，事实也证明，农业专家们只有在田间、在牧棚里、在拖拉机站上才能更好地运用自己的知识。阿罗木次和比尔森等州的农民都认为，农业专家们的技术指导对他们生产的提高很有帮助。
    在农业专家下放的同时，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府也在采取各种办法提高那些有丰富生产经验的农民的理论和技术水平，把他们培养成专家。例如，为他们开办为期一年的训练班，送大批青年农民到农业技术学校或农业大学去学习。
