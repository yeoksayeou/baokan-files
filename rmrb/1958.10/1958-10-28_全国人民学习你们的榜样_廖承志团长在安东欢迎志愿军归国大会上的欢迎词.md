The Whole Nation Should Learn From Your Example

Welcome Speech by Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi at the Welcome Rally in Andong for the Returning Volunteers

Dear Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army,

Dear commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:

The Chinese People's Welcome Delegation to the Returning Volunteer Army, representing the Communist Party of China, all people's organizations, and all democratic parties, has come from the capital to Andong to welcome you. We, representing the 650 million people of the motherland, extend our highest respect, warmest welcome, and most cordial greetings to our most beloved people—the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army who have performed meritorious service!

Eight years ago, American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea. When the flames of war approached our country's border, you—the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland—marched valiantly and spiritedly across the Yalu River, fighting alongside the Korean people. With the support of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union and world peace forces, you defeated the aggressive army headed by American imperialism, punctured the American paper tiger, and inflicted upon the American aggressors a shameful defeat unprecedented in American history. This is a great victory for the people of both Korea and China. Comrades, you have victoriously completed the task entrusted to you by the people of the motherland and have gloriously returned to the motherland. Now, let us, on the banks of the Yalu River, filled with Sino-Korean friendship, in the heroic city of Andong, warmly cheer for the glorious victory of the struggle of the people of China and Korea against American aggression, and for the glorious victory of the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement!

This great victory of the people of China and Korea disrupted the American plan of aggression to dominate the world and inspired the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries to fight for national liberation, safeguard national independence, and oppose wars of aggression and colonialism. This victory most vividly proves a truth: that the power of the people is invincible, that American imperialism can be completely defeated, and that any oppressed nation, as long as it dares to rise up and wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against the aggressors, will surely achieve final victory.

Comrades, the Korean people are the closest brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people. In the common struggle against American aggression, the people of China and Korea shared weal and woe, stood together in adversity, and fought side by side, forging a friendship as close as flesh and blood. The heroic struggle of the Korean people against the ferocious American aggressors not only defended the independence of their country but also guaranteed the security of our country and the smooth development of our socialist construction. During the stay of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, the elders, brothers, and sisters of Korea treated the Volunteer Army as family, offering sincere help. Over the years, countless "Volunteer Army mothers" and deeds like that of Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed himself to save our wounded soldiers, emerged in Korea. This high spirit of internationalism of the Korean people has profoundly educated the Chinese people and will forever be cherished and remembered. Recently, the activity of "Korea-China Friendship Month" was widely and warmly launched in various parts of Korea, and grand gatherings of various kinds were held to bid farewell to the Volunteer Army. The Korean people have always given deep concern and strong support to the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose American aggressors. Comrades, now that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completely withdrawn from Korea, please allow me, on behalf of the 650 million Chinese people, to express our most sincere respect and gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the fraternal Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and to the esteemed Premier Kim Il-sung!

Since the armistice, the socialist construction of the Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and through the great efforts of all the people, has achieved amazing successes. At present, the Korean people are carrying out the comprehensive construction of the motherland at the speed of Chollima. The entire republic is undergoing rapid changes day by day. We Chinese people are infinitely excited and proud of the achievements of the fraternal Korean people. We believe that the achievements of the Korean people are the achievements of the Chinese people, and the victory of the Korean people is the victory of the Chinese people. Let us here wish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea growing prosperity and strength!

The Chinese people have always been concerned about and supported the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. In order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and further ease the situation in the Far East, the governments of China and Korea issued a joint statement on February 19 this year, once again suggesting the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. Subsequently, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army announced that it would withdraw all the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea before the end of this year. Now, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has fully implemented this withdrawal plan. This most vividly demonstrates the peaceful sincerity of the people of China and Korea and their firm confidence in safeguarding peace. However, the troops of the American aggressors are still clinging to South Korea, threatening the security of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and peace in Asia. We want to warn the American aggressors and their accomplices: you cannot stay here, and the longer you refuse to withdraw from southern Korea, the more passive you will become. If you dare to violate the armistice agreement and launch a war of aggression again, then as long as the Korean people deem it necessary, the Chinese people will not hesitate to send their outstanding sons and daughters again across the Yalu River to join the Korean people in giving the aggressors a devastating blow! Comrades, let us reiterate here: the fraternal Korean people will always receive the support of the entire Chinese people in defending national security, defending peace in the Far East and the world, and in the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea and building socialism. The people of China and Korea will always unite, fight together, and advance hand in hand. We firmly believe that the peaceful reunification of Korea's three thousand miles of beautiful rivers and mountains, and the desire of the thirty million compatriots in the north and south of Korea to be reunited, cannot be stopped by any force and will surely be realized.

Dear Comrades, as you all know, while recently the American aggressors have been carrying out a series of aggressive activities in Asia and Africa, they have also been stepping up their military provocations and threats of war against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, expanding their aggression against our country. This is something that all Chinese people can never tolerate. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, and complete the great cause of the reunification of the motherland. This great determination and will of the Chinese people cannot be shaken by any aggressive force or conspiracy. The American aggressors must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait! The American aggressors must get out of southern Korea!

Dear Volunteer Army Comrades, you have been away from the motherland for eight years. October 25th marks the eighth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's departure from the country. In the past eight years, the face of the motherland has undergone tremendous changes. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland are launching a high tide of all-round great leap forward in socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm. Eight years ago, our country's annual steel production was only hundreds of thousands of tons, while this year it will reach 10.7 million tons. Eight years ago, our country's annual grain production was only over 200 billion jin, while this year it will reach 600 to 700 billion jin. The spiritual outlook of the people throughout the country is also changing rapidly, communist ideology is being widely promoted, and the movement for the people's communes and universal military service is developing vigorously throughout the country. We firmly believe that our people will achieve even greater success in the great leap forward of socialist construction.

Comrades, your victorious return at this time has made the people all over the country jubilant. You, together with the Korean people, defeated the American aggressors on the battlefield. After the armistice, you actively helped the Korean people heal the wounds of war. The great achievements you have made will be remembered forever. You are the good sons and daughters of the motherland, and the good soldiers of the Party and Chairman Mao. Today, the people all over the country warmly welcome you back. The glorious posts of building a great motherland and completing the great cause of national reunification are waiting for you. The people of the whole country will strive to learn and carry forward your fearless spirit of enduring hardship and overcoming difficulties, and learn and carry forward your heroic spirit and great internationalism and patriotism.

Now is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. Chairman Mao tells us that the life of imperialism will not be long. American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated around the world, and the noose around its neck is tightening. If American imperialism dares to impose war on our powerful Chinese people, then the united and universally militarized Chinese people will learn from your example and resolutely and thoroughly wipe out the despicable aggressors!

Let us shout:

Salute to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who have performed meritorious service!

Salute to the heroic Korean people!

Long live the great victory of Resisting America and Aiding Korea!

Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the battle to Resist America and Aid Korea!

Long live the battle friendship forged in blood between the people of China and Korea!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    全国人民学习你们的榜样
    廖承志团长在安东欢迎志愿军归国大会上的欢迎词亲爱的中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇同志、政治
  委员王平同志亲爱的中国人民志愿军全体指战员同志们：
    中国人民欢迎志愿军归国代表团，代表着中国共产党、各人民团体、各民主党派，从首都来到安东迎接你们。我们代表祖国六亿五千万人民，向我们最可爱的人——劳苦功高的中国人民志愿军英雄们，致以最崇高的敬意、最热烈的欢迎和最亲切的慰问！
    八年前，美帝国主义对朝鲜发动了侵略战争。当战火逼近我国国境的时候，你们——祖国优秀的儿女，雄赳赳气昂昂地跨过了鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民并肩作战，在以苏联为首的社会主义各国和世界和平力量的支持下，打败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军，戳穿了美国纸老虎，使美国侵略者遭到了在美国历史上前所未有的可耻的失败。这是朝中两国人民的伟大胜利。同志们，你们胜利地完成了祖国人民的托付，光荣地回到了祖国。现在，让我们在洋溢着中朝友谊的鸭绿江畔，在英雄的城市安东，为中朝两国人民反对美国侵略斗争的辉煌胜利，为伟大抗美援朝运动的辉煌胜利而热烈欢呼！
    中朝两国人民的这一伟大胜利，打乱了美国称霸世界的侵略计划，鼓舞了亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族解放、维护民族独立和反对侵略战争，反对殖民主义的斗争。这一胜利，最生动地证明了一条真理，那就是，人民的力量是不可战胜的，美帝国主义是完全可以被打败的，任何被压迫的民族，只要敢于起来向侵略者进行坚决的、不屈不挠的斗争，就一定能够获得最后的胜利。
    同志们，朝鲜人民是中国人民最亲密的兄弟和战友。在反对美国侵略的共同斗争中，中朝两国人民同甘苦、共患难、并肩抗敌，用鲜血凝结成亲如手足的友谊。朝鲜人民对凶恶的美国侵略者进行的英勇斗争，不仅捍卫了自己国家的独立，而且也保障了我国的安全和我国社会主义建设事业的顺利发展。在中国人民志愿军留驻朝鲜的期间，朝鲜的父老兄弟姊妹，对志愿军亲如家人，热诚相助。几年来，在朝鲜不知出现了多少“志愿军的妈妈”和朴在根那样舍身拯救我军伤员的事迹。朝鲜人民的这种高度的国际主义精神，深深地教育了中国人民，使中国人民永远感激，铭刻于心。最近，朝鲜各地广泛地热烈地展开了“朝中友好月”的活动，举行了规模盛大的欢送志愿军的各种集会。朝鲜人民对中国人民解放台湾和反对美国侵略者的正义斗争，一贯给予深切的关心和有力的支持。同志们，现在当中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜的时候，请让我代表六亿五千万中国人民，向朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，向兄弟般的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，向敬爱的金日成首相，表示最衷心的敬意和感谢！
  自从停战以来，朝鲜人民的社会主义建设事业在朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，经过全体人民的巨大努力，已经取得了惊人的成就。目前，朝鲜人民更以千里马的速度进行着祖国全面的建设事业。整个共和国正在经历着日新月异的变化。我们中国人民对于兄弟般的朝鲜人民取得的成就，感到无限兴奋和骄傲。我们认为，朝鲜人民的成就就是中国人民的成就，朝鲜人民的胜利就是中国人民的胜利。让我们在这里祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国日益繁荣和富强！
    中国人民一贯关心和支持朝鲜人民的和平统一祖国的斗争。为了促进朝鲜的和平统一和进一步缓和远东局势，今年2月19日中朝两国政府发表了联合声明，再一次建议撤退朝鲜的一切外国军队。接着，中国人民志愿军总部就宣布在今年年底以前把中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜。现在，中国人民志愿军已经完全实现了这个撤军计划。这就最生动地表明中朝两国人民的和平诚意和维护和平事业的坚强信心。但是美国侵略者的军队至今还赖在南朝鲜不走，威胁着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的安全和亚洲的和平。我们要警告美国侵略者和它的帮凶：你们赖在这里是不行的，你们一天不从朝鲜南部撤兵，你们就会永远被动下去。如果你们胆敢破坏停战协定，重新发动侵略战争，那么只要朝鲜人民认为需要，中国人民就会毫不迟疑地派出自己的优秀儿女，再次跨过鸭绿江，同朝鲜人民一起给侵略者以毁灭性的打击！同志们，让我们在这里重申：兄弟般的朝鲜人民，在保卫国家安全、保卫远东和世界和平，在和平统一朝鲜和建设社会主义的事业中，永远会得到全体中国人民的支援。中朝两国人民将永远团结在一起，共同奋斗，携手前进。我们坚信：朝鲜的三千里锦绣河山的和平统一，朝鲜南北三千万同胞的骨肉团聚的愿望，是任何势力也无法阻挡的，是一定会实现的。
    亲爱的同志们，你们都知道，最近美国侵略者在亚洲和非洲进行一系列侵略活动的同时，又在台湾海峡地区加紧对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，扩大对我国的侵略。这是我们全中国人民决不能容忍的。中国人民一定要解放台、澎、金、马，完成祖国统一的大业。中国人民这种伟大的决心和意志是任何侵略力量和阴谋所动摇不了的。美国侵略者必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去！美国侵略者必须从朝鲜南部滚出去！
    亲爱的志愿军同志们，你们离开祖国已经八年了。10月25日正是中国人民志愿军出国八周年。八年来，祖国的面貌起了巨大的变化。在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，祖国人民正以冲天的干劲，掀起了社会主义建设全面大跃进的高潮。八年前我国钢的年产量只有几十万吨，而今年将达到一千零七十万吨。八年前，我国的粮食的年产量只有二千多亿斤，而今年将达六千亿到七千亿斤。全国人民的精神面貌也在迅速发生变化，共产主义思想得到广泛的发扬，全国人民公社化和全民皆兵的运动，正在全国各地蓬勃发展。我们完全相信，我国人民将在社会主义建设大跃进中取得更加巨大的成就。
    同志们，你们在这一时候胜利归来，使全国人民为之兴高采烈。你们在战场上同朝鲜人民一起打败了美国侵略者。停战后，你们又积极帮助朝鲜人民医治战争创伤。你们所立下的丰功伟绩将流芳万世。你们是祖国的好儿女，是党和毛主席的好战士。今天全国人民热烈地欢迎你们回来。建设伟大祖国和完成祖国统一大业的光荣岗位，在等待着你们。全国人民将要努力学习和发扬你们的不怕艰苦、不怕困难的大无畏精神，学习和发扬你们的英雄气概和伟大的国际主义和爱国主义精神。
    现在，是东风压倒西风的时代。毛主席告诉我们，帝国主义的寿命不会很长了。美帝国
  主义在全世界愈来愈孤立，套在它脖子上的绞索愈拉愈紧。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们强大的中国人民的头上，那么团结一致和全民皆兵的中国人民将学习你们的榜样，把可耻的侵略者坚决、彻底的消灭干净！
    让我们高呼：
    向劳苦功高的中国人民志愿军致敬！
    向英雄的朝鲜人民致敬！
    伟大的抗美援朝胜利万岁！
    在抗美援朝战斗中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
    中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
