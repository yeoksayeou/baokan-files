Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian Dispatch: The national electric furnace steelmaking banner—the Dalian Steel Plant—created a national record of 61 tons of electric furnace utilization coefficient on the 29th. This is an increase of 4.4 tons compared to the new record it created on the 21st. The national electric furnace "champion"—the plant's No. 1 furnace—created an astonishing record of 74.3 tons utilization coefficient on the 29th.

This high-yield record, which was unimaginable in ordinary times, was created by the combined forces of the Dalian Steel Plant workers' drive, collaboration, and technology. Casting workers squeezed every second they could from their own intense labor to help the steelmaking workers evenly load materials, speeding up the melting of steel after it entered the furnace. Steelmaking workers broke the boundaries between furnaces, and technically better steelmaking workers, after taking care of their own furnaces, ran to help other furnace workers create new records. Steelmaking workers adopted new technologies such as simultaneously feeding oxygen and gas into the electric furnace to melt steel and external deoxidation, greatly shortening the steelmaking time.

This newspaper reports: On September 29th, the Tangshan Steel Plant's steel output broke through the 1,000-ton mark, creating a historical record of 1,042.66 tons.

As early as the beginning of September, the Tangshan Steel Plant workers resolved to respond to the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with practical actions of greatly increasing steel production. On September 23rd, the plant once again revised its annual leap forward plan, raising it from the past 330,000 tons to 500,000 tons. The key to greatly increasing steel production lies in shortening the smelting time and expanding capacity. The workers worked hard and delved deeply, successfully adopting advanced Soviet oxygen-enriched steelmaking technology, shortening the average smelting time per furnace from 32 minutes to 20 minutes, increasing daily production by more than 100 tons of steel. With the shortening of smelting time, the iron melting furnace, crane, block making and other equipment could not meet the needs of steelmaking. The workers converted the No. 6 crane into a ball bearing, speeding up the crane; increased the utilization rate of the iron melting furnace by using water cooling; and quickly added a block making pool. In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical strength due to the large number of steelmaking workers supporting other factories, the workers changed from the past three shifts to two major shifts. These measures ensured the rapid increase in steel production.

The 29th was the day of the decisive battle to achieve a daily output of 1,000 tons. The battle began at midnight, and the plant's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders and workers all threw themselves into the decisive battle with the posture of charging into battle. All types of work carried out extensive cooperation, and groups launched red flag competitions to seize steel. After the Wang Yiyuan group of workers smelted the first furnace of steel in 25 minutes, the Fan Tian group of workers exceeded the Wang Yiyuan group with 20 minutes per furnace. Then the Guo Yongzhen group of workers created a historical record of smelting a furnace of steel in 14 minutes of pure blast time by using oxygen-enriched blowing. As a result, this shift smelted 94 furnaces of steel, an increase of more than 20 furnaces compared to the previous shift. In order to surpass Class A, the Class B workers proposed to resolutely surpass Class A and seize the red flag before the shift handover. As a result, this shift smelted 95 furnaces.

    大连钢厂电炉利用系数加码  唐山钢厂日产量突破千吨关
    新华社旅大电　全国电炉炼钢红旗——大连钢厂在29日创造了电炉利用系数六十一吨的全国最高纪录，这比它在21日创造的新纪录增加了四点四吨。全国电炉“冠军”——这个厂的一号炉，29日更创造了利用系数七十四点三吨的惊人纪录。
    这个平时难以想像的高产纪录，是在大连钢厂职工们的干劲、协作加上技术三股力量汇合下创造出来的。铸锭工人在自己紧张的劳动中，还挤出一分一秒时间，帮助炼钢工人均匀地装料，使钢料入炉后能加快熔化。炼钢工人打破炉子与炉子之间的界限，技术较好的炼钢工人照料好自己的炉子，就跑去帮助其他炼炉工人创造新纪录。炼钢工人们采用氧气和煤气同时通进电炉熔化钢料和炉外脱氧等新技术，大大缩短了炼钢时间。
    本报讯　9月29日，唐山钢厂钢产量突破了千吨大关，创造了一千零四十二点六六吨的历史最高纪录。
    还在9月初，唐山钢厂职工决心用大量增产钢的实际行动响应中共中央政治局扩大会议提出的号召。9月23日，这个厂再次修订了全年跃进计划，由过去三十三万吨提高到五十万吨。在大量增产钢当中，关键在于缩短冶炼时间扩大容量，职工们苦干深钻，采用苏联富氧炼钢先进技术成功，由过去平均每炉钢冶炼时间三十二分钟缩短到二十分钟，每天可多产一百多吨钢。冶炼时间缩短了，化铁炉、天车、造块等设备不能满足炼钢需要。职工们把六号天车改成滚珠轴承，加快了天车速度；用水冷却的办法提高化铁炉利用率；迅速添造了造块池。为了解决因炼钢工人大量支援外厂而技术力量不足的问题，职工们就由过去三班改成了两大班操作，这些措施，保证了钢的产量迅速上升。
    29日是实现日产一千吨决战的一天。午夜零点战斗打响了，厂党、政、工、团领导干部和工人，个个以冲锋陷阵的姿态投入决战，各工种大搞协作，组与组展开了夺钢红旗竞赛。王益元小组工人用二十五分钟炼出了第一炉钢之后，范田小组工人又用每炉二十分钟超过了王益元小组。接着郭永珍小组工人用富氧吹炼创造了纯鼓风时间十四分钟炼一炉钢的历史纪录。结果这班炼了九十四炉钢，比前一班提高了二十多炉。乙班工人为了超过甲班，交接班前，提出要坚决超过甲班夺取红旗，结果这班炼出了九十五炉。
