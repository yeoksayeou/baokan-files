Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Taipei News – The talks between U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek concluded this morning. Dulles has already flown back to Washington this afternoon.

Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek issued a joint communiqué after the talks. This communiqué acknowledged that the U.S.'s original plot to use China's suspension of shelling of Kinmen to promote a "permanent ceasefire" had been broken. It said: "These consultations were arranged during the two weeks in which the Chinese Communists announced their willingness to implement a ceasefire (referring to the suspension of shelling) on Kinmen. The two sides originally hoped that, under these circumstances, it would have been possible to primarily consider those measures that could have helped stabilize a de facto non-belligerent situation. However, on the eve of the consultations, the Chinese Communists resumed shelling of the Kinmen Islands. In view of these developments, these consultations naturally largely involved the military aspects of the situation."

The communiqué slandered the Chinese people's punitive shelling of the Kinmen Chiang troops as a "new act of aggression" and stated: "The following point is recognized: In the current circumstances, the defense of Kinmen and Matsu is closely related to the defense of Taiwan and Penghu." This once again demonstrates that the U.S. authorities still adhere to their policy of expanding the scope of aggression against China.

The communiqué attempted to distort the civil war between the Chinese people and Chiang Kai-shek into an international dispute between China and the Soviet Union on one side and the U.S. and Chiang on the other, in order to create a pretext for U.S. intervention; and threatened the Chinese people with "all-out war" to abandon the struggle to safeguard their territorial sovereignty and integrity. This section of the communiqué stated: "The Chinese Communists, with the support of the Soviet Union, openly attempt to conquer Taiwan, eliminate Free China, and drive the United States out of the entire Western Pacific, forcing the United States to abandon its collective security arrangements with the free nations of this region. This policy can never succeed. The two sides hope and believe that the Communists, in the face of the proven unity, determination, and strength of the United States and the Government of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group), will not test their policy with all-out war, and that they will abandon the military steps they have already taken to embark on their futile and dangerous policy."

The communiqué stated that "in addition to discussing the current military situation," the two sides "also considered some broad and long-term aspects of their relationship." In this regard, the United States openly demonstrated its reactionary stance of antagonizing the 600 million Chinese people. The communiqué said, "The United States recognizes the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group) as the true spokesperson for the hopes and aspirations of free China and the vast Chinese people. ... The Government of the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group) considers it its sacred mission to restore the freedom of its people on the mainland." The communiqué went on to say, "It (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) believes that the basis of this mission lies in the hearts of the Chinese people, and that the main method of successfully realizing this mission is to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, rather than using force." It can be clearly seen from this that the United States is not only playing the aggressive conspiracy of "two Chinas," but also unreservedly showing that its "long-term" policy is to further develop from "two Chinas" to overthrowing the People's Republic of China.

The joint communiqué avoided mentioning those issues that caused serious differences in the talks, as revealed by various sources, and repeatedly mentioned the "unity" between the U.S. and Chiang. It said that this meeting between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek "provided a new opportunity to demonstrate this unity." This wording of the communiqué had long been anticipated by Western news agencies, which predicted that the communiqué would inevitably emphasize the "unity" of both sides to conceal the truth.

Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: Taipei News – According to Western news agencies, the joint communiqué issued by Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon, which emphasized "greater unity," was the product of a lengthy bargaining process during the talks.

United Press International said that Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek were apparently making efforts to "end their talks" in the end, and that "Dulles was originally scheduled to return home yesterday, but he postponed his scheduled departure from Taipei by one day."

The report said that Dulles's change of plan and decision to hold another meeting with Chiang Kai-shek this morning "showed that the talks encountered far greater difficulties than expected." The meeting this morning lasted a very long time. According to the Associated Press, the meeting was devoted to drafting the final communiqué, and Dulles only finalized his departure time from Taipei after the end of the last meeting.

U.S. news agencies said that the section in the communiqué stating that "the defense of Kinmen and Matsu is closely related to the defense of Taiwan and Penghu" was included at Chiang Kai-shek's request. During the talks, Chiang Kai-shek's group's newspapers continued to demand that the United States "clearly guarantee" to help the Chiang Kai-shek group "defend Kinmen and Matsu."

A United Press International report said that the section in the communiqué about Chiang Kai-shek's "guarantee not to use force to recover the mainland" was "accepted by Chiang Kai-shek after Dulles explained the U.S.'s views." Sources revealed that Dulles believed that the Chiang Kai-shek group "has no hope of reconquering the mainland with their current manpower and resources," and that Dulles was hoping to create "uprisings" on the mainland in the future to achieve "return to the mainland."

Agence France-Presse reported that U.S. sources in Taipei said that the issue of "redeploying" Chiang Kai-shek's troops would be discussed later "at an appropriate time." During the talks, Western news agencies reported that the U.S. and Chiang had differences of opinion on whether to reduce the number of Chiang's troops and whether to withdraw some of Chiang's troops from the coastal islands.

An Agence France-Presse report pointed out that Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek would reaffirm the "consolidation of the U.S.-Chiang alliance and part ways," but that the differences between the two sides "cannot be eliminated or even reduced with a single round of talks."

### 空谈“团结”掩饰不了分歧  蒋杜公报腔调不一打算不同  美国坚持敌视中国人民，阴谋制造“两个中国”

    空谈“团结”掩饰不了分歧
    蒋杜公报腔调不一打算不同
    美国坚持敌视中国人民，阴谋制造“两个中国”
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈在今天上午结束。杜勒斯已经在今天下午乘飞机回华盛顿。
    杜勒斯和蒋介石在会谈结束后发表了联合公报。这份公报承认美国原来准备利用中国暂停炮击金门来推行“永久停火”的阴谋已被打破。它说：“这次磋商是在中国共产党人宣布他们愿意对金门实行停火（指暂停炮击）的两个星期中安排举行的。双方原来希望，在这种情况之下，本来是可以主要考虑那些本来可以有助于稳定一种实际的非战局面的种种措施的。但是，在磋商的前夕，中国共产党人恢复了对金门岛群的炮击，鉴于这些事态发展，这些磋商当然在很大程度上牵涉到局势的军事方面。”
    公报诬蔑中国人民对金门蒋军的惩罚性炮击是“新的侵略行为”，并且说：“下面这一点被认识到：在目前情况下，金门以及马祖的防务，同台湾和澎湖的防务是密切相关的。”这就再次表明了美国当局仍然坚持它扩大对中国的侵略范围的政策。
    公报企图把中国人民与蒋介石之间的内战歪曲为以中苏为一方、美蒋为另一方的国际争端，为美国的干涉制造借口；并且以“全面战争”来威胁中国人民放弃维护自己领土主权完整的斗争。公报的这一段说：“中国共产党人在苏联的支持下公开企图征服台湾，消灭自由中国和把美国赶出整个西太平洋，迫使美国放弃它跟这个地区的自由国家作出的集体安全安排。这个政策是决不可能成功的。双方希望并且相信，共产党人在美国和中华民国政府（指蒋介石集团）的已经得到证明的团结、决心和力量面前，不会以全面战争来试验他们的政策，他们会放弃他们为了着手实行他们的徒劳无益而危险的政策而已经采取的军事步骤。”
    公报说，“除了讨论当前的军事局势以外”，双方“还考虑了它们的关系的一些广泛和长远的方面”。在这方面，美国公然表明了它敌视六亿中国人民的反动立场。公报说，“美国承认中华民国（即蒋介石集团）是自由中国的以及广大中国人民所抱的希望和愿望的真正代言人。……中华民国政府（即蒋介石集团）认为，恢复它在大陆上的人民的自由是它的神圣使命。”公报接着说，“它（指蒋介石集团）认为，这个使命的基础就在中国人民心中，而胜利地实现这个使命的主要方法是实行孙中山先生的三民主义，而不是使用武力。”从这里可以清楚地看出，美国不仅在玩弄“两个中国”的侵略阴谋，而且毫不掩饰它的“长远”政策就是要由“两个中国”进一步发展到推翻中华人民共和国。
    联合公报避而不谈各方面透露的会谈中引起严重分歧的那些问题，并且多次提到美蒋之间的“团结”。它说，杜勒斯和蒋介石的这次会谈“提供了一个新的机会来显示这种团结”。公报的这种措辞连西方通讯社的消息也早就料到了，它们预告，公报势必要强调双方“团结一致”来掩饰真相。
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：据西方通讯社透露，杜勒斯和蒋介石今天下午发表的强调“更加团结”的联合公报，是在会谈中经过长时间讨价还价后的产物。
    合众国际社说，杜勒斯和蒋介石最后显然是在努力“结束他们的会谈”，“杜勒斯本来应当在昨天启程回国，他把预定离开台北的时间推迟了一天”。
    消息说，杜勒斯改变原定计划，决定在今日上午再次同蒋介石会谈，“显示会谈碰到了比预料还要大得多的困难”。而今天上午的会谈进行了很长的时间，据美联社说，这次会谈就是在草拟最后发表的公报，杜勒斯是在最后一次会议结束以后才确定离开台北的时间的。
    美国通讯社说，公报中谈到
  “金门和马祖的防务与台湾和澎湖的防务是密切相关的”一节，是在蒋介石要求下列入的。在会谈期间，蒋介石集团报纸曾继续在要求美国
  “明确保证”帮助蒋介石集团“保卫金马”。
    合众国际社消息说，公报中关于蒋介石“保证不是使用武力来收复大陆”的一段，是“在杜勒斯说明了美国的意见以后，蒋介石接受了这一条”。有消息透露，杜勒斯认为蒋介石集团“凭他们目前的人力物力并无重新征服大陆的希望”，杜勒斯在“重返大陆”上是指望将来在大陆上制造“起义”。
    法新社报道，台北美国人士说，关于蒋介石军队的“重新部署”问题，要留待以后“适当的时候”再来讨论。会谈期间，西方通讯社曾经传出，美蒋在是否削减蒋军人数以及是否从沿海岛屿撤退一部分蒋军上，有意见分歧。
    法新社一条消息指出，杜勒斯和蒋介石会重申美蒋“联盟的巩固而分手”，但是双方间的分歧“不是会谈一番就能够加以消除或者甚至减少的”。
