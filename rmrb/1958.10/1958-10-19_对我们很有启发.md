    Very Inspiring to Us
    In September, the teachers and students of our Central Commercial Cadre School went to Xinxiang Special District, Henan, to participate in the movement of farmers establishing people's communes and to receive practical communist ideological education. We are currently studying the question of the communist sprouts in the people's communes. The "Excerpts from Classic Works on Building Socialism Ahead of Schedule and Gradually Transitioning to Communism" and the article "Seeing Communism from the People's Communes" published on page eleven of the People's Daily on October 1st were very inspiring to us. We suggest that the newspaper further explore this issue.

    对我们很有启发
    我们中央商业干部学校师生，9月间到了河南新乡专区，参加农民建立人民公社的运动，接受实际的共产主义思想教育。目前正研究人民公社中共产主义萌芽的问题。人民日报10月1日第十一版上，刊登“提早建成社会主义并逐步向共产主义过渡”的经典著作摘要，和“从人民公社看共产主义”一文，对我们很有启发。建议报纸进一步探讨这个问题。
