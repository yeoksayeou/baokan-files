    "Exchanging Sweat for Steel, Counting Time in Seconds"
    Capital's Steel Production Surges
    (Our dispatch) On the eve of National Day, the people of the capital achieved a major victory on the steel front. On September 29th, the city produced a total of 1,016.5 tons of steel, which is 6.48 times the average daily output in August and 4.4 times the average daily output in the first and middle ten days of September.
    A year ago, Beijing was almost a "blank slate" in steelmaking. Apart from a few factories with small electric furnaces used for steel castings, there was no dedicated steel plant or steelmaking workshop. In order to realize the great call of the Party Central Committee to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the people of the capital went all out to complete the new construction and expansion projects of the Special Steel Plant, the Beijing Steel Plant, and the small converter steelmaking workshop of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in a short period of one month, and quickly put them into production. In addition, many factories, construction enterprises, schools, and municipal enterprises in the city have also joined the mass steelmaking movement.
    In order to create a high-yield record for steel as a gift to National Day, the broad masses of workers and staff on the front and rear of the city's steel front have been working day and night, forgetting sleep and food, for days. Secretaries and factory directors stayed by the furnace day and night, and workers stayed on the front line for 24 hours and 48 hours continuously; "exchanging sweat for steel, counting time in seconds." Finally, on the 29th, the city's daily steel output was suddenly increased to more than 1,000 tons.

    “以汗水换取钢水，以分秒计算时间”
    首都钢产量猛增
    本报讯　国庆前夕，首都人民在钢铁战线上取得了重大胜利，九月二十九日这一天，全市共产钢一千零一十六点五吨，为8月份平均日产量的六点四八倍。为9月上、中旬平均日产量的四点四倍。
    一年以前，北京在炼钢方面还几乎是个“白点”，除了几家工厂有少数用作铸钢件的小型电炉外，没有一个专门的炼钢厂或是炼钢车间。为了实现党中央提出的今年产钢一千零七十万吨的伟大号召，首都人民全力以赴地在短短的一个月里，连续完成了特殊钢厂、北京钢厂和石景山钢铁厂小型转炉炼钢车间的新建和扩建工程，并迅速投入生产。此外，本市许多工厂，建筑企业、学校和市政企业也纷纷投入全民炼钢的运动。
    为了创造钢的高产纪录，作为向国庆节的献礼。全市钢铁战线前后方的广大职工群众，连日来废寝忘食，昼夜奋战。书记、厂长日夜守在炉旁，工人们连续二十四小时、四十八小时不下火线；“以汗水换取钢水，以分秒计算时间”，终于，在29日这一天，把全市钢的日产量一下子提高到千吨以上。
