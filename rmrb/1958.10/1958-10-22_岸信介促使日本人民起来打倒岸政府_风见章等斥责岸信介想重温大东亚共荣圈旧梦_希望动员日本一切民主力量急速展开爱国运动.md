Xinhua News Agency, 21st. KAZAMI Akira, head of the Japanese National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Delegation to China, and TAKAKURA Teru, a famous Japanese writer currently visiting China, unanimously condemned KishI Nobusuke's remarks filled with aggressive ambitions made to American journalist Brown when interviewed by Xinhua News Agency reporters on the evening of the 20th.

At the beginning of the interview, KAZAMI Akira first showed the reporter a telegram that he and other Japanese figures from various circles visiting China, including ITO Takeo, KANETA Tomitaro, HOSOKAWA Karoku, HIRANO Yoshitaro, and OKADA Haruo, were about to send to Japan. The telegram expressed surprise and anger at the seriousness of KishI Nobusuke's remarks to Brown, and pointed out that the Chinese people's exposure of KishI Nobusuke's imperialist ambitions and attempts to rebuild the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was completely correct. This telegram, addressed to the leaders of the Japanese Socialist party, the Japanese Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the National Federation of Farmers' Associations of Japan, and the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution of Japan, called on all democratic forces in Japan to unite and rapidly launch a series of patriotic national movements to oppose the revision of the constitution, oppose the establishment of a Northeast Asia military alliance, oppose the policy of hostility towards China, oppose all laws restricting people's freedom, and demand the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty."

KAZAMI Akira said that recently even the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun" have strongly condemned KishI Nobusuke's remarks to Brown. He pointed out that this situation shows that opposition to KishI Nobusuke is rising even higher in Japan, and the trend of establishing a united front against KishI Nobusuke is increasing day by day.

KAZAMI Akira also said that KishI Nobusuke's remarks will prompt the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the KishI Nobusuke Cabinet. He expressed his intention to mobilize the peace-loving Japanese people to fight together with the Chinese people.

TAKAKURA Teru condemned KishI Nobusuke's remarks exposing his militarist ambitions from the perspective of a writer. He said that Japan's politics, economy, and military are currently subordinate to the United States, and the same is true of culture. The decadent American culture is deeply poisoning Japan. The purpose of spreading American colonialist culture in Japan is to revive fascism and militarism in Japan. KishI Nobusuke's remarks can also be taken as proof of this fact.

This Japanese writer, who had just attended the Asian-African Writers' Conference, discussed the achievements of the conference. He said that regardless of possible differences in thought and belief, writers and people from Asian and African countries are united on the points of anti-colonialism, independence, democracy, and peace. He emphasized that he believed that all patriotic writers in Japan would unanimously feel great anger at KishI Nobusuke's remarks.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st. KAZAMI Akira and other nine Japanese figures from various circles currently visiting China sent a telegram back home on the 21st, criticizing KishI Nobusuke's remarks to American journalist Brown and demanding that all democratic parties and organizations launch a patriotic national movement. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To: SUZUKI Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist party
    NOSAKA Sanzo, Chairman of the Japanese Communist Party
    OTA Kaoru, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan
    KUBOTA Yutaka, Chairman of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations of Japan
    KATAYAMA Tetsu, Chairman of the National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution of Japan

We, who are visiting China, have learned of Prime Minister KishI's remarks made to an NBC reporter on October 14. We are surprised and angered by the seriousness of KishI Nobusuke's remarks. KishI Nobusuke is attempting to sell out the motherland to the United States, militarize Japan, and relive the old dream of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is nothing but a blatant provocation to China and the Soviet Union, as well as to all people of conscience in Asian countries and the world who demand peaceful coexistence. This will further worsen Japan-China relations, undermine peace in Asia and the world, and will lead the motherland to a shameful defeat. We absolutely cannot tolerate KishI Nobusuke's plot. Various newspapers in Japan have strongly criticized the extremely dangerous content contained in KishI Nobusuke's remarks. We believe this reflects the will of the Japanese people. As pointed out in the October 17th "Yomiuri Shimbun" commentary, this KishI Nobusuke speech proves that the Chinese people's view of the KishI Nobusuke government is completely correct. The Chinese people have been warning that the KishI Nobusuke government has imperialist ambitions and is attempting to rebuild the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Needless to say, the KishI Nobusuke government has rekindled the anger of the Chinese people. At this time, we deeply hope to mobilize all democratic forces in the country, bravely and rapidly launch a patriotic national movement to oppose the revision of the constitution, oppose the Northeast Asia military alliance, oppose the policy of hostility towards China, oppose all laws restricting national freedom, and demand the abolition of the Japan-US security treaty. The October 17th "People's Daily" has already published a serious observer's commentary on this issue. This commentary concludes: The Chinese people will resolutely stand with the peace-loving people of Japan and fight to the end to defend peace in Asia and the world, and to completely destroy the imperialist forces that are invading China, invading Asia, and wreaking havoc on the world!

We will also join your fighting ranks and fight with you. We wish you a strong struggle.
          KAZAMI Akira, HOSOKAWA Karoku, ITO
          Takeo, OKADA Haruo,
          SAKAMOTO Akira, HIRANO Yoshitaro,
          KAWAKAMI Kanichi, KANETA Tomitaro,

    岸信介促使日本人民起来打倒岸政府
    风见章等斥责岸信介想重温大东亚共荣圈旧梦
    希望动员日本一切民主力量急速展开爱国运动
    新华社21日讯　日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团团长风见章和正在中国访问的日本著名作家高仓辉20日晚上在接见新华社记者时，一致表示谴责岸信介向美国记者布朗发表的充满侵略野心的谈话。
    接见一开始，风见章就向记者发表了他和其他正在中国访问的日本各界人士伊藤武雄、兼田富太郎、细川嘉六、平野义太郎、冈田春夫等人即将拍到日本国内去的一封电报。这封电报对岸信介向布朗发表的谈话的严重性表示惊讶和愤怒，并指出中国人民揭露岸信介的帝国主义的野心和企图重建大东亚共荣圈，是完全正确的。这封发给日本社会党、日本共产党、日本工会总评议会、全日本农民协会联合会、日本拥护宪法国民联合会的领导人的电报，呼吁日本国内一切民主力量团结起来，急速展开一系列的爱国的国民运动，反对修改宪法，反对建立东北亚军事同盟，反对敌视中国的政策，反对一切限制人民自由的法律，并且要求废除日美“安全条约”。
    风见章说，最近连日本的“朝日新闻”和“读卖新闻”也强烈谴责岸信介对布朗发表的谈话。他指出，这种情况说明，在日本国内反对岸信介的情绪更加高涨了，建立反对岸信介的统一战线的趋势在日益增强。
    风见章又说，岸信介的谈话将促使日本人民起来打倒岸信介内阁。他表示要把爱好和平的日本人民动员起来，和中国人民共同进行斗争。
    高仓辉从作家的角度谴责了岸信介暴露其军国主义野心的谈话。他说，日本的政治、经济、军事目前都从属于美国，同样文化也从属于美国。美国的堕落的文化深深地毒害着日本。在日本传布美国的殖民主义文化，目的在于在日本复活法西斯主义和军国主义。岸信介的这次谈话也可以作为这一事实的印证。
    这位刚刚参加了亚非作家会议的日本作家论述了这次会议的成就。他说，不论思想、信仰可能有什么不同，亚非各国作家和人民在反殖民主义、独立、民主、和平这些点上意见是一致的。他强调说，他相信，日本一切爱国的文学家将对岸信介这次谈话一致感到极大的愤怒。
    新华社21日讯　正在中国访问的风见章等九位日本各界人士21日打电报回国，指责岸信介向美国记者布朗发表的谈话，并且要求各民主政党和团体展开爱国的国民运动。电文如下：
    日本社会党铃木茂三郎委员长
    日本共产党野坂参三主席
    日本工会总评议会太田熏议长
    全日本农民协会联合会久保田丰委员长
    日本拥护宪法国民联合会片山哲主席
    在中国进行访问的我们，得悉岸首相于10月14日向美国全国广播公司记者发表的谈话。岸信介的谈话的严重性使我们感到惊讶和愤怒。岸信介企图把祖国出卖给美国，使日本军国主义化，并且在重温大东亚共荣圈的旧梦。这不外是对中国和苏联以及要求和平共处的亚洲各国和全世界有良心的人们的露骨的挑衅。这将使日中关系进一步恶化，破坏亚洲和世界和平，并且将使祖国遭到可耻的失败。我们决不能容忍岸信介的这种阴谋。日本国内各报纸都对岸信介谈话中所包含的极其危险的内容加以强烈的抨击。我们相信这反映了日本国民的意志。正如10月17日的“读卖新闻”的评论所指出的，这次的岸信介谈话证明，中国人民对岸信介政府的看法是完全正确的。中国人民一直发出警告说，岸信介政府有帝国主义的野心，而且企图重建大东亚共荣圈。不消说，岸信介政府重新激起了中国人民的愤怒。在这个时候，我们深切地希望在国内动员一切民主力量，勇敢地、急速地展开爱国的国民运动，反对修改宪法，反对东北亚军事同盟，反对敌视中国的政策，反对一切限制国民自由的法律，要求废除日美安全条约。10月17日的“人民日报”已经就这个问题发表了严正的观察家评论。这个评论最后说：中国人民将坚决地和日本爱好和平的人民站在一起，为保卫亚洲和世界和平，为彻底摧毁侵略中国、侵略亚洲、为祸世界的帝国主义势力而奋斗到底！
    我们也将参加到你们的战斗队伍之中，同你们一起进行斗争。祝你们坚强奋斗。
