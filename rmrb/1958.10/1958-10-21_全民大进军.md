    All-out People's Advance
    Xin Weifang
    The call to eradicate bourgeois right ideas is growing louder day by day, and a formation to completely eradicate them has taken shape. People have laid down a dragnet from all directions. Under heavy encirclement, bourgeois right ideas, this bad thing that is good at sneaking into people's minds to cause trouble, has nowhere to hide.
    This is a great battle to eliminate capitalism and promote communism, and it is also a battle for people to advance to the gate of communism. The armies from all sides, with thousands of soldiers and horses, relying on the power of communism, will surely win a complete victory.
    Which armies are these, you ask? First and foremost is the working class, who personally raised the communist red flag of "labor without pay, work without conditions" in their minds. Guided by this red flag, they first broke through the shackles of calculating compensation in production, and then began to sweep away the piece-rate wage system, overtime pay, bonus pay, and other systems that reflect the residual influence of bourgeois right ideas. They ridiculed the piece-rate wage system, which was designed to accommodate people's private ownership ideas, as "worn-out shoes" and demanded to take them off and replace them with a new pair. What kind of new shoes to replace them with? New shoes that prioritize politics instead of money, a pair of shoes that embody the spirit of "one for all, all for one." Don't underestimate "money in command." Despite the thousands of words spoken by scholars, it is not as insightful as the working class's exposure that "money in command" is the essence of bourgeois right ideas. In the past, it was considered reasonable to have "money in command." This was the bourgeois right ideas showing its power in people's minds. Now, it is considered unreasonable to have "money in command" and it must be overthrown. This is precisely the proof of having raised the communist red flag. What the current wage system is like is another matter, because it must consider many other conditions, especially the level of social production and material life. But in the ideological realm, there can only be the communist red flag flying. All white flags, gray flags, yellow flags, and all kinds of miscellaneous flags must all be overthrown. The mass action of the working class to abolish the piece-rate wage system is a great action of pulling out the white flag and establishing the red flag.
    In our People's Liberation Army, there has also been a high tide of communist thought. Generals and officers at all levels have gone down to the company to serve as soldiers in the ranks, calling their actions "eliminating the residual influence of bourgeois right ideas" and promoting the communist fine tradition of the People's Army, which is well deserved. Although some say that the concept of hierarchy is only the legacy of feudalism, while bourgeois right ideas are "equality" and "freedom," in fact, the bourgeoisie only destroyed the form of the feudal hierarchy (which was not even thorough) and completely absorbed the essence of the feudal hierarchy, making it more adapted to its own requirements. The guise of "equality" and "freedom" cannot hide people's eyes and ears. The bourgeoisie's rule over the proletariat, the suzerain state's rule over the colonies, and even the large monopoly capitalist groups' annexation of small capital all clearly exposed the shape of the hierarchy. Isn't "big fish eats small fish" a naked concept of hierarchy? It's just that the bourgeois gentlemen dressed up their plunder a little more civilized than the slave owners and feudal lords. Our "generals serving as soldiers," however, truly embodies complete equality between people and most directly embodies the essential relationship between people in communism. The people's soldiers have already proposed the initiative to restore the supply system in the army, and cadres of government organs are also brewing the restoration of the supply system. People's hearts long for the supply system, which shows that people yearn for the communist way of life and are disgusted with the way of life that reflects the remnants of private ownership. Writers have already advocated reducing and gradually abolishing royalties, and "want the red flag, not money" has become the cry that has won the greatest resonance. These are all directly hitting bourgeois right ideas.
    Here, I want to especially talk about the peasants of our current era. The peasants should be emphasized, not only because they are the largest in number and the most widely distributed, a force that influences social development, but also because they are the army that is leaping forward the fastest. For thousands of years, small farmers have been the most conservative and habitual, and, in addition to the exploiting classes, their private ownership ideas are also the deepest. Therefore, it can be said that this is the place where bourgeois right ideas are most deeply rooted. Some people believe that the exploiting classes are easy to eliminate, but bourgeois right ideas are difficult to overthrow, mainly referring to the fact that peasants account for an absolute number. In particular, bourgeois spokespersons in the Western press say that the small family concept of Chinese peasants can never be broken. They were there tsk-tsking, saying that we would definitely offend the public and fall on our faces in the people's commune movement. However, the first to adopt a partial supply system among the masses were the Chinese peasants. Eating without paying is an unprecedented initiative. Organize militarily, produce like a battle, live collectively, think communistically. This slogan, which resounded throughout the country, was first shouted by the peasants, and they were the first to take action. The Chinese peasants have proved to people that, under the leadership of the working class, once the communist red flag is planted in their minds and continuously revolutionized, their entry into communism is not as difficult as originally envisioned. The positive significance of what Chairman Mao said, "The serious problem is the education of the peasantry," is also fully revealed here.
    Bourgeois right ideas have now become street rats, chased and beaten by everyone. Although it is the most cunning and most hidden enemy, under the all-out people's advance, it only has one way to die.

    全民大进军

    破除资产阶级法权观念的呼声一天天高涨，彻底铲除资产阶级法权观念的阵势已经形成，人们从四面八方布下了天罗地网，在重重包围之下，资产阶级法权观念，这一善于钻入人们头脑里兴妖作怪的坏东西，再也无处藏躲了。
    这是一场灭资兴无的大战斗，而且是人们进军到共产主义关前的战斗。各路大军，千兵万马，仗了共产主义的威风，是定能获得全胜的。
    你道有哪几路大军？首先是工人阶级，亲手在思想上插起了“劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件”的共产主义红旗。在这面红旗引导之下，先在生产上突破了计较报酬的枷锁，接着便动手来扫荡计件工资制、加班费、超额奖金等等反映着资产阶级法权观念残余影响的制度。他们嘲笑为适应人们私有观念而设的计件工资制是“穿破了的鞋子”，要求脱下来另换一双新鞋。换什么样的新鞋？换不是钞票挂帅而是政治挂帅的新鞋，换一双体现“我为人人，人人为我”精神的新鞋。不要小看了“钞票挂帅”，尽管学者们说了千言万语，但不如工人阶级的一语道破，“钞票挂帅”正是资产阶级法权观念的精髓。以前认为“钞票挂帅”合理，这是资产阶级法权观念在人们头脑里显神通，现在认为“钞票挂帅”不合理，必须打倒，这正是插上了共产主义红旗的证明。如今的工资制度怎样，是另一会事，因为它还必须考虑其他许多条件，特别要考虑到社会生产水平和物质生活水平，但在思想领域里，却只能有共产主义红旗飘扬，一切白旗、灰旗、黄旗以及各色杂旗，统统都在打倒之列。工人阶级的群众性的取消计件工资制的行动，正是大拔白旗大树红旗的伟大行动。
    在我们的人民军队里，也出现了共产主义思想的高潮，将军们和各级军官们以一个普通士兵的身份下连当兵去了，他们把自己的行动称作是“破除资产阶级法权观念的残余影响”，发扬人民军队的共产主义优良传统，这是当之无愧的。尽管有人说等级观念只是封建主义的衣钵，而资产阶级法权观念是“平等”和“自由”。其实，资产阶级只是毁除了封建主义等级制度的形式（这也并不彻底），而完全吸取了封建主义等级观念的精髓，并使之更加适应自己的要求。“平等”和“自由”的外衣并掩不住人们的耳目，资产阶级对无产阶级的统治，宗主国对殖民地的统治，甚至大的垄断资本集团对小资本的吞并，都明显地裸露了等级观念的形体，难道“大鱼吃小鱼”还不是赤裸裸的等级观念，只是资产阶级绅士们把自己的掠夺行为装扮得比奴隶主和封建主文明一点罢了。我们的“将军当兵”，却是真正体现了人与人间的完全平等，最直接地体现了共产主义的人与人间的本质关系，人民战士们，已经提出了在部队中恢复供给制的倡议，机关干部们也在酝酿恢复供给制。人心思念供给制，这说明人们渴望共产主义的生活方式，而厌恶了反映私有制残余的生活方式，作家们已经倡议降低以至逐步取消稿费报酬，“要红旗不要钞票”，成了博得最大共鸣的呼声。这些都直接打击着资产阶级法权观念。
    这里要特别地谈一谈我国的现时代的农民，农民的应该被强调，不只是因为它数字最大，分布最广，是一支左右社会发展的力量，而且，因为它是跃进得最快的一支大军。几千年来，小农是最具有保守的传统习惯性的，而且，除去剥削阶级以外，它的私有观念也最深，因此可以说这是资产阶级法权观念植根最深的一个所在。有人认为剥削阶级容易消灭，但资产阶级法权却很难打倒，主要是指的农民占绝对数量的这一事实。特别是西方报刊上的资产阶级发言人们说，中国农民的小家庭观念是永也无法破除的。他们在那啧啧议论，说我们在人民公社运动上一定会触犯众怒而大倒其霉。然而，在群众中最早采用部分供给制的，是中国的农民，吃饭不要钱，这是举世无双的创举。组织军事化，生产战斗化，生活集体化，思想共产主义化，这个响遍全国的口号，首先是农民们喊出来的，而且动手得最早。中国的农民，向人们证明：在工人阶级领导下，一旦思想上插起了共产主义红旗，不断革命化，他们步入共产主义并不是像原来设想的那样困难的。毛主席说的“严重的问题在于教育农民”的积极意义，也便在这里完全地显现出来了。
    资产阶级法权，如今已经成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。尽管它是一个最狡猾、最隐蔽的敌人，但是，在全民的大进军下，它也只有死路一条。
