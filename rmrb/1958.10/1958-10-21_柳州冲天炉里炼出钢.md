Xinhua News Agency, Liuzhou, 19th: Reporter Gong Chenghua reports: A brand-new steelmaking method in the metallurgical industry – directly smelting steel from pig iron using a cupola furnace (traditionally used for melting iron) – has been successfully tested at the Liuzhou Metallurgical Plant in Guangxi. This is another innovation in steel industry smelting technology.

Modern converter steelmaking generally involves first melting pig iron into molten iron in a cupola furnace, and then pouring it into a converter to smelt into steel. Using a cupola furnace to directly make steel combines the two processes of iron melting and steelmaking into one, which can save all the converters used for steelmaking and greatly shorten the steelmaking time. This is of great significance for accelerating steel production. The day after Liuzhou city promoted the metallurgical plant's experience – the 15th – the city's daily steel production immediately surged from an average of 52 tons in the previous four days to 520 tons. The steel directly smelted in the cupola furnace has been analyzed and found to be of good quality.

The equipment used for steelmaking by the Liuzhou Metallurgical Plant is a cupola furnace made of three gasoline drums connected together, measuring 2.6 meters high with a volume of 0.6 tons. They first installed an air inlet pipe on the furnace where it contacts the molten iron, at a 30-degree angle to the liquid surface; another air inlet pipe was installed 15 centimeters above this one at a 9-degree angle. During steelmaking, air is blown into the furnace through the upper air inlet pipe to cause the coke to burn and melt the pig iron. The molten iron, once melted, falls downwards like raindrops inside the furnace chamber. As it passes through the high-temperature area inside the furnace chamber, it undergoes a violent oxidation process, burning off impurities such as manganese, silicon, and carbon in the molten iron. After such direct blowing, the molten iron falls to the bottom of the furnace. It is then blown again by the second air inlet pipe. After such layered blowing, the impurities and carbon elements in the molten iron are rapidly reduced, and the molten iron turns into steel.

The second method used by the Liuzhou Metallurgical Plant to directly make steel in a cupola furnace is to combine the various raw materials added in the two processes of iron melting and steelmaking into one process, adding them in stages according to the needs of directly making steel from pig iron. When proportioning the materials, they added a certain proportion of ferrosilicon and ferromanganese, and at the same time added more talc and limestone than in the past when melting iron, in order to better remove sulfur and phosphorus from the molten iron and improve the quality of the steel. In addition, they reduced the amount of coke used from 20% to 12%. They enlarged the slag outlet of the cupola furnace, making it like the mouth of a Bessemer converter. This makes it easier to discharge waste gas, and the blowing effect is better.

Using the above methods, the Liuzhou Metallurgical Plant has smelted high-carbon steel with a carbon content of 0.984% to 1.412%. The average time for each steel output from the cupola furnace is 15 minutes.

    柳州冲天炉里炼出钢
    据新华社柳州19日电　记者龚成华报道：冶金工业上的一种崭新的炼钢方法——用化铁用的冲天炉将生铁直接炼钢，已在广西柳州冶炼厂试验成功。这是钢铁工业冶炼技术方面的又一创举。
    近代转炉炼钢一般都是先在冲天炉里把生铁化成铁水，然后倾入转炉熔炼成钢。利用冲天炉直接炼钢，把化铁、炼钢两道工序并为一道，这就可以把炼钢用的转炉全部节约下来，使炼钢时间大大缩短。这对加速钢的生产具有重大意义。柳州市推广了冶炼厂的这一经验后的第二天——15日，全市钢的日产量就立即由前四天的平均五十二吨激增到五百二十吨。在冲天炉里直接炼出的钢，经过化验分析，质量良好。
    柳州冶炼厂炼钢使用的设备，是一个用三个汽油桶连接成的高二·六公尺、容积为零点六吨的冲天炉。他们先在炉子接触铁水面的地方装一个进风管，与液面水平成三十度斜角；在比这个风管高十五公分的地方再装上一个斜角九度的进风管。炼钢时，通过上层进风管向炉内鼓风，使焦炭燃烧熔化生铁。溶化后的铁水在炉腔内像雨点一样向下洒落，在通过炉腔内的高温地区时，引起剧烈的氧化作用，将铁水中的锰、矽、碳等等杂质烧掉。铁水经过这样的直接吹炼以后，下落至炉底炉缸。接着，又被第二进风管的风吹炼。经过这样分层吹炼以后，铁水中的杂质和碳元素迅速降低，铁水也就变成了钢。
    柳州冶炼厂用冲天炉直接炼钢的第二个办法，是按照用生铁直接炼钢的需要，把化铁、炼钢两个过程中加入的各种原料综合在一个过程中分次加入。他们在配料时，加进一定比例的矽铁和锰铁，同时加进比过去化铁时多一些的滑石粉和石灰石，以便更好地去掉铁水中的硫、磷，提高钢的质量。此外，他们还把焦炭用量由20％减少到12％。把冲天炉的出渣口加大，使它成为贝氏转炉的炉口。这样废气易于排出，吹炼作用就更好。
    柳州冶炼厂采取以上办法，炼出了含碳量为0.984％到1.412％的高碳钢，冲天炉每出一次钢的时间，平均为十五分钟。（附图片）
