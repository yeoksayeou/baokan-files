Xinhua News Agency, October 12th: The Polish People's Republic Military Attaché in China, Colonel Hankiewicz, and his wife held a reception tonight to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Army.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended warm festive greetings to the fraternal Polish People's Army. He said that the Polish People's Army grew and strengthened in the anti-fascist struggle, demonstrating heroic and tenacious spirit in extremely difficult combat years. After the liberation of Poland, under the leadership of Polish United Workers' Party and the government, the Polish People's Army has been built as a revolutionary army with modern weapons and equipment. This army is steadfastly defending the socialist construction of its motherland, and together with the armies of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, jointly safeguarding European and world peace.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that in recent years, with the increasing development of friendly relations between our two countries, the friendly exchanges between our two armies have also been strengthened. Last year, the Polish military delegation headed by General Spychalski, the Polish Minister of National Defense, visited our country. Currently, our military delegation headed by Marshal Ye Jianying is visiting Poland. These visits will help enhance mutual understanding between the people and armies of our two countries, and further consolidate and develop the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people and armies of our two countries, which is conducive to defending our common cause of building socialism and defending peace.

Colonel Hankiewicz spoke first at the beginning of the reception.

After describing the glorious history of the Polish People's Army over the past fifteen years, he said that today, the Polish People's Army, possessing modern weapons and excellent military training, is a powerful link in the Warsaw Pact armed forces. Together with the world's strongest army—the Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army—and the armies of other socialist countries, it defends peace and socialism. Shoulder to shoulder with its allies, it is always ready to safeguard the freedom of other countries in the socialist camp as it safeguards the freedom of its own country.

Colonel Hankiewicz expressed that the soldiers of the Polish People's Army, who have a sincere friendship with the great People's Chinese Army, warmly support the just demand of the Chinese people to recover the territory that has belonged to them since ancient times.

Those invited to attend tonight's reception included General Xiao Hua, Air Force General Liu Yalou, General Chen Xilian, General Li Juikui, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Fang Qiang, Air Force Lieutenant General Wu Faxian, and others.

Also invited to the reception were the heads of various democratic parties and the Sino-Polish Friendship Association, as well as Yu Zhan, Deputy Director of the Department of Socialist Countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Major General Szameit, the Polish Chief Commissioner of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, and Major General Sille, the Czechoslovak Chief Commissioner, who came to our country to attend the National Day celebrations, also attended the reception.

Also attending the reception were Polish Chargé d'affaires ad interim in China, Fū Lātào, and diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries in China.

At the end of the reception, a film soiree was held. (Attached picture)

    新华社12日讯　波兰人民共和国驻华武官韩凯维奇上校及夫人今晚举行招待会，庆祝波兰人民军建军十五周年。
    国防部长彭德怀元帅代表中国人民解放军全体官兵向兄弟般的波兰人民军致以热烈的节日的祝贺。他说，波兰人民军是在反法西斯斗争中成长和壮大起来的，在极端艰苦的战斗岁月里，表现了英勇顽强的精神。波兰解放后，在波兰统一工人党和政府的领导下，波兰人民军已建成为一支拥有现代化武器和装备的革命军队。这支军队正坚定不移地保卫着自己祖国的社会主义建设，并和以苏联为首的兄弟国家军队一起，共同维护着欧洲和世界和平。
    彭德怀元帅说，近年来，随着我们两国友好关系的日益发展，我们两国军队之间的友好来往也日益加强了。去年以波兰国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基上将为首的波兰军事代表团到我国访问，目前，以叶剑英元帅为首的我国军事代表团正在波兰访问。这些访问都有助于增进我们两国人民和军队之间的相互了解，并进一步巩固和发展我们两国人民和军队之间牢不可破的兄弟友谊，有利于保卫我们建设社会主义和保卫和平的共同事业。
    韩凯维奇上校在招待会开始时首先讲话。
    他在叙述了波兰人民军建军十五周年的光荣历史之后说，今天，拥有现代化武器和优良军事训练的波兰人民军，是华沙条约武装力量有力的一环。它与世界上最强大的军队——苏联军队和中国人民解放军，以及其他社会主义国家的军队一起保卫着和平和社会主义，与它的同盟者肩并肩地时刻准备着像保卫自己祖国的自由一样维护着社会主义阵营其他国家的自由。
    韩凯维奇上校表示，与伟大的人民中国军队有着真挚友谊的波兰人民军战士热烈支持中国人民收回自古以来就属于自己的领土的正义要求。
    应邀参加今晚招待会的有萧华上将，刘亚楼空军上将，陈锡联上将，李聚奎上将，刘志坚中将，萧向荣中将，方强海军中将，吴法宪空军中将等。
    应邀参加招待会的，还有各民主党派和中波友好协会的负责人，以及外交部社会主义国家司副司长余湛。
    来我国参加国庆节观礼的朝鲜中立国监察委员会波兰首席委员沙麦特少将，捷克斯洛伐克首席委员席列少将也参加了招待会。
    参加招待会的还有波兰驻华临时代办傅拉托和各国驻华使节及武官。
