Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Sanzo Nosaka, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement today, strongly condemning the remarks made by Nobusuke Kishi to Cecil Brown, Tokyo correspondent for the American National Broadcasting Company. He said that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks not only show that the Kishi Nobusuke government is assisting the U.S. aggressive policy, but also prove that he harbors the ambition to turn Japan into an imperialist aggressor state.

　　Nosaka pointed out that the series of measures recently forcibly promoted by the Kishi Nobusuke government, such as the "performance rating" system, the attempt to revise the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the enactment of the "Anti-Espionage Law," and the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," are all concrete manifestations of his ambition. Nosaka accused the Kishi Nobusuke government of attempting to establish a war preparedness system capable of launching aggressive wars.

　　Nosaka pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's statement that "to use force to prevent communist countries from liberating Taiwan and South Korea" not only shows that he intends to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, but also exposes his conspiracy to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance including Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

　　Nosaka stated that the Japanese Communist Party will stand at the forefront of the Japanese people and wage a resolute struggle to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to deprive the people of democracy and establish an imperialist aggressive war system.

　　Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, said in Chiba on the evening of the 15th that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks show that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet intends to revise the "Security Treaty" in order to open a path to war. Suzuki said that he would thoroughly question this matter in the Diet session.

　　The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning the aggressive ambitions exposed by Kishi Nobusuke's remarks to American reporters, advocating the abolition of the Japanese Peace Constitution, advocating sending troops abroad to "defend" Taiwan, and blatantly attacking China.

　　The statement said that it is incomprehensible that Kishi Nobusuke, as the prime minister of a country, rashly broadcast important policies that have not yet been announced to the Japanese people to foreign countries; Kishi Nobusuke's purpose in doing so is to turn Japan into an aggressor state again, which is the most dangerous behavior felt by the Japanese people. The "General Council" stated that it absolutely cannot tolerate this behavior.

　　The statement said: "Article 9 of the Constitution (the clause on renouncing war) was won by our compatriots with bloodshed and sacrifice in the imperialist aggressive war."

　　The "General Council" pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks also exposed his true intentions to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law." The statement condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for submitting the "Amendment to the Police Duties Execution Law" to the extraordinary session of the Diet, regardless of the Japanese people's firm opposition.

　　The statement stated that while opposing the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law," the "General Council" will fight to the end against the Kishi Nobusuke government's aggressive attempt through concrete actions during the period from this autumn to next spring.

　　Toru Kobayashi, Permanent Director of the Japan Peace Committee, pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks are a blatant and concrete manifestation of the Japanese government's policy of following the United States in pursuing a policy of hostility towards China, promoting Japan's nuclear armament, and betraying Asian countries.

　　Kobayashi pointed out, however, that this does not prove the strength of imperialist aggression forces; on the contrary, it proves that the growing socialist forces led by the Soviet Union are forcing the U.S. and Japanese imperialist aggression forces to a dead end.

　　Kobayashi said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is forcibly implementing fascist policies at home. Therefore, the struggle to defend Asian peace is inseparable from the struggle against fascism and to safeguard democracy.

　　Kobayashi called on all Japanese people to strengthen unity to deal with the current emergency situation.

　　Tetsu Katayama, chairman of the Japan National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, said that judging from the current policies pursued by the Kishi Nobusuke government, his remarks are an outpouring of his inner thoughts. Katayama pointed out that the Japanese Constitution is already facing a major threat of being undermined.

　　Katayama firmly stated that they will launch a vigorous movement to protect the Constitution in order to crush the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to undermine the Constitution in order to revive fascism. Katayama said that, therefore, it is first necessary to stop the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law."

    日本走帝国主义老路
    日本公众强烈谴责岸信介阴谋
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会委员裤田里见今天发表谈话，强烈谴责岸信介对美国全国广播公司驻东京记者塞西耳·布朗发表的谈话。他说，岸信介的这番谈话不仅表明岸信介政府在协助美国的侵略政策，而且证明他抱有把日本变成帝国主义侵略国家的野心。
    裤田指出，岸信介政府最近强制推行的“勤务评定”制度，企图修改日美“安全条约”，制定“防谍法”和修改“警察官职务执行法”等一系列的措施，都是他的这种野心的具体表现。裤田指责岸信介政府企图建立能够发动侵略战争的备战体系。
    裤田指出，岸信介说“要以实力阻止共产主义国家解放台湾和南朝鲜”，这不仅表明他有意干涉外国内政，而且暴露了他的确有建立包括日本、李承晚、蒋介石的东北亚军事同盟的阴谋。
    裤田表示，日本共产党将站在日本人民的前列进行坚决斗争，以粉碎岸信介政府剥夺人民的民主和建立帝国主义侵略战争体系的阴谋。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎15日晚上在千叶发表谈话说，岸信介的谈话表明，岸信介内阁企图修改“安全条约”，以便开辟一条通往战争的道路。铃木表示要在国会会议上彻底追问这件事情。
    日本工会总评议会15日发表声明，严辞谴责岸信介对美国记者发表的主张废除日本和平宪法，主张派兵出国“保卫”台湾，并且明目张胆地攻击中国的谈话所暴露出来的侵略野心。
    声明说，岸信介身为一个国家的首相，而把还没有向日本人民宣布的重要政策轻率地向外国广播，这是令人不能理解的；岸信介这样做的目的在于把日本再次变成一个侵略国家，这是日本人民感到最为危险的行为。对于这种行为，“总评”表示绝对不能容许。
    声明说：“宪法第九条（关于放弃战争的条款）是我国同胞在帝国主义侵略战争中用流血牺牲争取到的。”
    “总评”指出，岸信介的这番谈话，还自己暴露了他修改“警察官职务执行法”的真正企图。声明谴责岸信介政府不顾日本人民的坚决反对，硬把“警察官职务执行法修正案”提交国会临时会议的行为。
    声明表示，在反对修改“警察官职务执行法”的同时，“总评”将在今年秋天到明年春天的期间通过具体行动对岸信介政府的侵略企图斗争到底。
    日本和平委员会常任理事小林彻指出，岸信介的谈话是日本政府追随美国奉行敌视中国的政策、推进日本的核武装、背叛亚洲国家政策的既露骨又具体的表现。
    小林指出，但是，这并不能证明帝国主义侵略势力的强大，相反地是证明以苏联为首的日益壮大的社会主义力量迫使美、日帝国主义侵略势力走投无路。
    小林说，岸信介政府在国内强制推行法西斯政策，因此，保卫亚洲和平的斗争同反对法西斯、维护民主的斗争是分不开的。
    小林号召全体日本人民加强团结来对付目前的紧急局面。
    日本拥护宪法国民联合会主席片山哲说，从岸信介政府推行的现行政策来看，他的谈话是把他的内心吐露出来了的。片山指出，日本宪法已经面临遭受破坏的重大威胁。
    片山坚决表示，他们将展开有力的拥护宪法的运动，以便粉碎岸信介政府企图破坏宪法以便复活法西斯主义的阴谋。片山说，因此，首先必须阻止岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的企图。
