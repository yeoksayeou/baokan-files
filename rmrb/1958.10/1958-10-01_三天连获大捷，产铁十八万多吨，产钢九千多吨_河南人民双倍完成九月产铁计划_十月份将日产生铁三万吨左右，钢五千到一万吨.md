    Zhengzhou, October 30th (By Our Staff Reporter) – The people of Henan Province launched three consecutive "high-yield satellite" campaigns for iron and steel production on September 28th, 29th, and 30th as a gift to National Day. In these three days, the province produced a total of 186,358.75 tons of iron and 9,156.21 tons of steel. Specifically, on September 28th, the province produced 64,483.49 tons of iron and 895.92 tons of steel; on September 29th, 90,784.68 tons of iron and 5,003.4 tons of steel; and on September 30th, as of 4:00 PM, 31,089.58 tons of iron and 3,256.89 tons of steel. As of now, the province produced a total of 278,152.36 tons of iron in September, exceeding the quota by 106%, completing the state plan and exceeding its own leap forward plan by 19.24%. The fact that Henan has achieved large-scale continuous harvests in iron and steel production for three consecutive days shows the people that the province's mass iron and steelmaking movement has entered a stage of large-scale, regular production, and marks a complete victory for the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach in Henan Province.
    On the 28th and 29th, when satellite counties with daily production of over 1,000 and 10,000 tons of iron constantly emerged from the Funiu Mountains, Dabie Mountains, Taihang Mountains, and other regions, Lushan County had the highest iron production among the three counties with daily production of over 10,000 tons on the 28th, producing 34,390 tons of iron. Secondly, Xinyang County produced 12,631.3 tons of iron. Thirdly, Shangcheng County produced 12,567.5 tons of iron. On the 29th, Baofeng County also produced 24,664 tons of iron, surpassing Xinyang County's iron production on the 28th, thereby winning second place among the counties with daily production of over 10,000 tons in the province. However, Xinyang and Shangcheng Counties achieved another large-scale harvest in iron production on the 29th. On this day, Xinyang County produced 5,692.28 tons of iron, and Shangcheng County produced 4,600.07 tons of iron. The counties with over 1,000 tons of iron also included Lin County, producing 4,033.5 tons of iron, the An(yang) Nei(huang) Pu(yang) cooperation zone, producing 3,555 tons of iron, Bo'ai County, producing 2,500 tons of iron, Yanshi County, producing 1,694.8 tons of iron, and Dengfeng County, producing 1,528 tons of iron. A steelmaking satellite appeared in Luoyang City, which produced 2,003 tons of steel on the 29th.
    On the 29th, over 128,000 various small, indigenous iron furnaces throughout the province were spewing molten iron, and 4,282 various steelmaking furnaces were splashing sparks of molten steel. Over 5.77 million people were fighting on the front lines of the furnaces, mines, riverbanks, underground, and iron and steel transportation lines.
    Having achieved brilliant victories on the iron and steel front, the people of Henan are advancing victoriously. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward new goals for the people of the province, requiring that the province produce approximately 30,000 tons of iron and 5,000 to 10,000 tons of steel daily in October, ensuring the completion of 900,000 tons of iron and 200,000 tons of steel for the entire month.

    三天连获大捷，产铁十八万多吨，产钢九千多吨
    河南人民双倍完成九月产铁计划
    十月份将日产生铁三万吨左右，钢五千到一万吨
    本报郑州30日电　河南省人民在9月28日、29日和30日连续发射出三颗钢铁大面积丰产卫星，向国庆节献礼。这三天全省共产生铁十八万六千三百五十八点七五吨。产钢九千一百五十六点二一吨，如果分别开来说，全省在28日产生铁六万四千四百八十三点四九吨；产钢八百九十五点九二吨；29日产生铁九万零七百八十四点六八吨，产钢五千零三点四吨；30日截至下午四时止的统计，产生铁三万一千零八十九点五八吨，产钢三千二百五十六点八九吨。至此全省在9月份共产生铁二十七万八千一百五十二点三六吨，超额106％，完成了国家计划并且超过本身跃进计划19.24％，这三天河南连续获得钢铁生产大面积丰收的事实向人民表明这个省群众性的炼钢炼铁已经步入大量的经常地生产轨道，并标志着“小、土、群”方针在河南省取得了全面胜利。
    在28、29两天里日产生铁千吨和万吨以上的卫星县不断地从伏牛山、大别山、太行山等地区出现时，全省在28日出现的三个日产万吨以上生铁的县以鲁山县为最高，产生铁三万四千三百九十吨。其次是信阳县产生铁一万二千六百三十一点三吨，再次，是商城县产生铁一万二千五百六十七点五吨，在29日又出现了宝丰县也产生铁二万四千六百六十四吨，超过了28日信阳县的产铁量。从而获得了全省日产万吨以上县的第二名。可是，信阳、商城二县在29日又获得炼铁大面积丰收。这天，信阳县产生铁五千六百九十二点二八吨，商城县产生铁四千六百零点零七吨，这天出现的千吨县还有林县产生铁四千零三十三点五吨，安（阳）内（黄）濮（阳）协作区产生铁三千五百五十五吨，博爱县产生铁二千五百吨，偃师县产生铁一千六百九十四点八吨，登封县产生铁一千五百二十八吨。炼钢卫星出现在洛阳市，这个市在29日产钢二千零三吨。
    在29日这天全省十二万八千多座各种炼铁小土炉喷吐着铁水，四千二百八十二座各种炼钢炉飞溅着钢花，战斗在炉旁矿山河边井下和钢铁运输线上的大军有五百七十七万多人。
    在钢铁战线上取得辉煌胜利的河南人民正乘胜前进，中共河南省委已经向全省人民提出了新的奋斗目标，要求在10月份里全省日产生铁三万吨左右，钢五千到一万吨。保证全月完成九十万吨生铁二十万吨钢。
