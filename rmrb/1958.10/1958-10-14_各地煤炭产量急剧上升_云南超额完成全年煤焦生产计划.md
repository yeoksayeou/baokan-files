Xinhua News Agency, 13th: "Men, women, young, and old are all mobilized, building large camps in the coal fields, with a great leap forward in coal production, guaranteeing the steel mission." This is a folk song sung by the masses in the Daying People's Commune of Baofeng County, Henan Province, and it is actually a true reflection of many provinces and autonomous regions across the country.

In the past month or so, a mass movement to stockpile grain and gather grass for the steel marshal has been launched on the coal production front. According to statistics from ten provinces, including Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Shandong, and Zhejiang, more than four million people have been invested in this movement, resulting in a significant increase in coal production. In early October, the national average daily raw coal production was more than 880,000 tons, an increase of 50% compared to the average daily production in August. Small coal kilns and local coal mines have seen the fastest growth, with output in early October reaching more than 350,000 tons, nearly doubling the average daily output in August.

As all parts of the country have grasped large-scale mine production and implemented the "small-scale indigenous groups" policy, thousands upon thousands of small coal kilns have been put into production. Areas that previously did not produce coal or produced very little coal are now planting red flags for coal production. Hubei Province was originally the province with the least coal production, with more than 90% of its coal needing to be transported from other provinces. Recently, under the personal leadership of the local Party committee secretaries, more than 100,000 people were mobilized to go up the mountains. As a result, 54 of the province's 71 counties have found coal resources and have excavated thousands of small coal kilns. Henan Province has adopted the method of tapping the potential of old wells, large wells leading small wells, and modern wells leading indigenous wells. In late September, it began organizing 500,000 people to go up the mountains to mine coal. It has now excavated more than 1,300 small coal kilns, and the average daily output in early October increased by 65% compared to September. By the end of September, Sichuan Province also had 15,000 small kilns in production. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also decided to transfer half of the existing eight million-strong steel army to specialize in coal production, which will not only guarantee the fuel needed for the province's increased steel production but also support other regions.

China is extremely rich in coal resources, with more than 1,500 of the country's 2,000+ counties having coal. This provides extremely favorable conditions for the widespread development of the "small-scale indigenous groups" coal mining movement in various regions. In the mass movement to vigorously mine coal, many regions have adopted the method of "soldier against soldier, general against general, using decentralized small coal kilns to counter decentralized indigenous blast furnaces," which can not only quickly meet the ever-increasing needs of steel production but also change the situation of massive coal requiring long-distance transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 13th: Since Yunnan Province launched a mass coal mining and coke refining movement, coal and coke production has soared. By the 10th of this month, both raw coal and coke had exceeded the annual plan by more than 30%. In order to reverse the phenomenon of coal and coke supply falling short of demand on the steel front, Party committees at all levels in Yunnan Province have recently strengthened their leadership over coal and coke production, making coal and coke production blossom everywhere. Some counties have organized the masses to conduct a great debate on the relationship between coal and coke production and steel and copper production, and many leading cadres have gone deep into the mines and furnaces to direct production. The province has newly opened no less than thousands of coal mine sites and indigenous coke kilns, and there are now seven counties with a daily raw coal output of 1,000 tons and ten counties with a daily coke output of 100 tons.

The workers and staff of the province's 200+ coal mines have also launched a massive high-yield movement. The workers and staff of the Mahuangjing Coal Mine launched a technical innovation movement of "winches for going up the mountain, chutes for going down the mountain, carts for flat roads, and mechanization of loading and unloading, and water pumping," and the daily output of raw coal increased fifteen-fold in just over twenty days.

### 各地煤炭产量急剧上升  云南超额完成全年煤焦生产计划

    各地煤炭产量急剧上升
    云南超额完成全年煤焦生产计划
    据新华社13日讯　“男女老少齐出征，煤炭阵地扎大营，煤炭生产大跃进，钢铁任务有保证。”这是河南省宝丰县大营人民公社群众唱的歌谣，其实也是全国许多省和自治区的真实写照。
    最近一个多月来，在煤炭生产战线上掀起了一个为钢铁元帅屯粮聚草的群众运动。据湖南、四川、江西、福建、山东、浙江等十个省的统计，投入这个运动的就有四百万人以上，因而使煤炭产量有了很大增长。10月上旬全国平均日产原煤八十八万多吨，比8月份的平均日产量增加50％。小煤窑和地方煤矿的增长幅度最快，10月上旬产量已达三十五万吨以上，超过8月份平均日产量将近一倍。
    由于全国各地在抓大矿生产的同时，贯彻了“小土群”的方针，已有成千上万的小煤窑投入了生产。过去不产煤或产煤很少的地区，现在都插上煤炭生产的红旗。湖北省原来是煤炭生产最少的省份，90％以上的用煤要从外省运去，最近经各地党委书记亲自挂帅，发动十多万人上山以后，全省七十一个县中五十四个县找到了煤炭资源，并且开挖了几千座小煤窑。河南省采用老井挖潜力、大井带小井、洋井带土井的办法，9月下旬开始组织五十万人上山开矿，现在已挖了一千三百多个小煤窑，10月上旬的平均日产量又比9月份增长了65％。四川省到9月底也已有一万五千个小窑投入生产，中共四川省委还决定从现有八百万钢铁队伍中抽调一半人力专搞煤炭生产，这样不但保证本省钢铁增产所需的燃料，还可以支援其他地方。
    我国煤炭资源非常丰富，全国二千多个县中就有一千五百多个县有煤。这为各地普遍开展“小土群”的挖煤运动提供了极为有利的条件。许多地区在大搞挖煤的群众运动中，采用了“兵对兵、将对将，以分散的小煤窑来对分散的土高炉”的办法，不但能够迅速满足钢铁生产不断增长的需要，同时还可以改变大量煤炭需要远距离运输的情况。
    据新华社昆明13日电　云南省开展群众性的挖煤炼焦运动后，煤焦产量扶摇直上。到本月10日，原煤和焦炭都超额30％以上完成了全年计划。为了扭转钢铁战线上煤焦供不应求的现象，云南省各级党委最近都加强了对煤焦生产的领导，使煤焦生产遍地开花。有的县组织群众展开了煤焦生产与钢铁铜生产之间的关系的大辩论，许多领导干部深入矿井炉旁指挥生产。全省新开的煤矿点和土焦窑不下数千处，出现了七个日产原煤千吨县和十个日产焦炭百吨县。
    全省二百多个煤矿的职工也展开了声势浩大的高产运动。蚂蝗阱煤矿职工展开了“上山绞车化、下山滑槽化、平路车子化、装卸、抽水土机械化”的技术革新运动，原煤日产量在二十多天内就提高了十五倍。
