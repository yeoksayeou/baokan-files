Xinhua News Agency, 20th, 15:00 - The order of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China is as follows:

To the People's Liberation Army comrades on the Fujian Front:

The Taiwan authorities introduced U.S. military escort in the Kinmen waters from the night of the 19th to the morning of the 20th. Our army's order to cease shelling Kinmen is declared invalid. Our army has ceased shelling twice, but the Taiwan authorities show no repentance. They persist in their stubborn attitude, refuse to accept peace talks, intensify war preparations, and clamor for a counterattack on the mainland. Now, on the eve of inviting Dulles to Taiwan to plot further implementation of the U.S.-Chiang "treaty," they have openly brought in U.S. warships for escort for as long as five hours. This is a blatant violation of our conditions for suspending shelling. This is intolerable! Therefore, shelling must be resumed as punishment.

It is a matter of national righteousness to absolutely not allow Americans to interfere in Chinese affairs. Those who are deluded are ultimately a small minority. The opportunity for the Taiwan authorities to correct their mistakes and accept a peaceful solution seems to still be awaited, and we continue to place our hopes on it. It is unacceptable for Americans to stay in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. American interference in China's internal affairs is absolutely not allowed. We absolutely do not recognize any collusion by the Americans using the Taiwan authorities to infringe upon our national sovereignty. The patriotic military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu should awaken; Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must return to the embrace of the motherland.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　Minister of National Defense　Peng Dehuai
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　October 20, 1958, 3:00 PM

Chinese affairs must not be interfered with by the Americans. This is a matter of national principle. The patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu should come to their senses.
Americans staying in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait is unacceptable. American interference in China's internal affairs is absolutely not allowed.

    台湾当局在金门海域引进美军护航，违反暂停炮击条件
    国防部命令恢复炮击以示惩罚
    中国人的事绝不允许美国人插手，这是民族大义。台澎金马爱国军民应觉悟过来。
   美国人赖在台湾和台湾海峡是不行的。美国人干涉中国的内政，是绝对不容许的。
    新华社20日15时讯　中华人民共和国国防部命令，全文如下：
    中华人民共和国国防部命令福建前线人民解放军同志们：
    台湾当局从十九日夜到二十日晨在金门海域引进美军护航，我军停止炮击金门命令，宣布无效。我军两次停止炮击，台湾当局毫无悔悟。他们坚持顽固态度，拒不接受和谈，加紧战争准备，高叫反攻大陆。现在，他们在邀请杜勒斯到台湾策划进一步实施美蒋“条约”的前夕，竟然把美国军舰引来护航达五小时之久，这是公然违反我们暂停炮击的条件。是可忍，孰不可忍？因此，必须恢复炮击，以示惩罚。
    中国人的事绝不允许美国人插手，这是民族大义。执迷不悟的人究竟是极少数。台湾当局迷途知返接受和平解决的时机，看来尚有所待，我们继续寄以希望。美国人赖在台湾和台湾海峡是不行的，美国人干涉中国内政，是绝对不容许的，美国人利用台湾当局进行任何侵犯我国主权的勾当，我们是绝对不承认的。台、澎、金、马的爱国军民应当觉悟过来，台、澎、金、马一定要回到祖国的怀抱。
                              国防部长　彭德怀
