Xinhua News Agency, October 8th dispatch from Moscow: As of 2:55 PM Beijing time on October 8th, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite had orbited the Earth two thousand times.

    One hundred and forty-seven days and nights have passed since this satellite was launched into space. During this period, it traveled 92.6 million kilometers, approximately equivalent to one hundred and twenty round trips from the Earth to the Moon. Its carrier rocket traveled an additional 47.6 orbits during this period.

    The satellite's orbital period has shortened by 2.15 minutes, now at 103.8 minutes, while the maximum altitude of the orbit (apogee) has decreased by 195 kilometers, now at 1,685 kilometers. The orbital parameters of the carrier rocket have undergone relatively large changes during this period. Its orbital period has shortened by 7.6 minutes, now at 98.2 minutes, while the maximum altitude of the orbit has decreased from 1,880 kilometers to 1,130 kilometers. Preliminary calculations indicate that the carrier rocket will enter the dense atmosphere and disintegrate between the end of November and the beginning of December this year.

    Observations of the third satellite and its carrier rocket's operation are continuing using optical and radio technology instruments. To date, the adjustment calculation center has obtained and processed more than 57,000 radio measurement materials, 4,500 optical observation materials of the satellite, and 18,000 observation materials of the carrier rocket. These materials can be used to determine the orbital parameters of the satellite and carrier rocket, and to determine the changes in these parameters over time. Based on the obtained changes in the satellite's orbit, the scientific observation results carried out on the third satellite can be accurately organized according to geographical location and time. Hundreds of radio stations and radio enthusiasts around the world continue to receive the radio signals from the "lighthouse" transmitter at a frequency of 20.005 megahertz.

    The brightness of the third artificial satellite is like a second magnitude star (equivalent to Polaris) to a seventh magnitude star (between Uranus and Neptune), while the carrier rocket is like a negative third magnitude star (equivalent to Venus) to a positive fourth magnitude star (equivalent to a star in Ursa Minor close to Polaris).

    天路历程
    第三个红月亮绕地球二千圈
    相当从地球到月亮一百二十个来回
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科消息：到10月8日北京时间十四点五十五分为止，苏联第三个人造卫星围绕地球运行了二千圈。
    从这个卫星上天到现在，已经过了一百四十七个昼夜。在这个期间，它走过了九千二百六十万公里的路程，约相当于从地球到月亮一百二十个来回。它的运载火箭在这个期间则多走了四七点六圈。
    卫星的运行周期已经缩短了二点一五分，现在是一零三点八分，而轨道最大高度（远地点）减少了一百九十五公里，现在是一千六百八十五公里。运载火箭的轨道参数在这个期间发生了比较大的变化。它的运行周期缩短了七点六分，现在为九八点二分，而轨道最大高度从一千八百八十公里降低到一千一百三十公里。初步计算表明，运载火箭将在今年11月底到12月初进入稠密大气层而陨灭。
    现在正在继续对第三个卫星及其运载火箭的运行用光学和无线电技术仪器进行观测。到目前为止，调整计算中心已经获得和整理了五万七千多次无线电测量材料，四千五百次对卫星的光学观测材料和一万八千次对运载火箭的观测材料。根据这些材料可以确定卫星和运载火箭的轨道参数，并确定这些参数随时间变化而发生的变化。根据已获得的卫星运行轨道的变化，可以把第三个卫星上进行的科学观测结果按地理位置和时间精确地加以整理。全世界几百个无线电台和无线电爱好者继续在接收频率二○·○○五兆周的“灯塔”发报机的无线电讯号。
    第三个人造卫星的亮度像二等星（相当于北极星）到七等星（在天王星和海王星之间），而运载火箭像负三等星（相当于金星）到正四等星（相当于小熊星座中紧挨北极星的一颗星）。
