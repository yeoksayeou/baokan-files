Daring to Break with Class Prejudice
Bai Dongqiao

Class prejudice, dating back to Mencius' proposition of "those who labor with their minds govern others; those who labor with their strength are governed by others," has existed for over two thousand years. For over two thousand years, this ideology has dominated people's minds, even influencing some working people. Passed down through generations, instilled through familiarity, it has become deeply rooted, forming a habitual force that seems self-evident and unshakable.

Fortunately, the root of this "force" has been cut off by the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production. However, its remaining branches and leaves will still exist for a certain period, tormenting the spirits of some people, causing them to feel melancholic, vexed, and miserable in the face of a leaping forward, constantly changing new society.

There is such a cadre who, upon being approved to go to the countryside for labor training, named his newborn child "Little Pitiable." In fact, the "little one" is not pitiable at all; he will be completely happy, while the "big one" is the one who truly feels pitiable. The so-called "Little Pitiable" is taking the opportunity to express his unspeakable suffering and to express his accumulated feelings of unwillingness to integrate with the peasants.

It is said that during the upsurge of establishing People's Communes, there were also such people who had hidden worries in their hearts. What was the reason? The commune is big, but the official is small; the district head becomes the commune director, and the commune director becomes the team leader or a member. They have been "demoted," which is not glorious.

It is said that there are also such individuals who worry that the supply system and communal dining will undermine their special lives superior to others, fearing that they cannot bear it. It is as if they were born with particularly tender intestines and stomachs. In reality, however, it only took them a few years to develop these intestines and stomachs.

Looking at it the other way around, the logic becomes even clearer. Since regarding being sent down to be a peasant as "pitiable" and calling being able to go up or down, being both an official and a civilian, as "not glorious," then if they were allowed to "rise" step by step, to remain "officials" forever, and to live a life detached from the people forever, that would certainly be "very happy" and "very glorious." What else could this be other than utter class prejudice and privileged thinking?

We want to build a communist society, to eliminate all remnants of bourgeois rights, to eliminate all differences between city and countryside, between manual and mental labor, and between workers and peasants. This is the inevitable trend of history and the law of social development. Class prejudice violates this objective law and is an object to be eliminated. Therefore, its existence is a scourge. People with this kind of thinking will undoubtedly run into walls in the face of new things. Their suffering and melancholy are inevitable.

Currently, a magnificent communist ideological education movement has been launched in various regions. Class prejudice and all old ideologies are about to go bankrupt, and the communist style of "one for all, all for one" will blossom everywhere. This is the general trend. We must join the battle and break with class prejudice and all old ideologies in our minds. This requires courage, perseverance, resilience, and tenacity. For some people, it also requires enduring temporary pain. Only in this way can deeply rooted class prejudice and all old ideologies be finally and thoroughly eliminated from our ideological field.

    勇于与等级观念决绝
    白东桥
    等级观念，从孟子提出“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的时候算起也有两千多年了，两千多年来，这种思想一直在统治着人们的头脑，连一些劳动人民也受了熏陶，历代相传，耳濡目染，根深而蒂固，形成了一种似乎是天经地义不可动摇的习惯势力。
    值得庆幸的是这种“势力”的根，已经被生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命砍断了。但是它的残枝余叶在一定时期还仍旧会存在，而且折磨着某些人的精神，使得这些人在飞跃前进，时刻变化着的新社会面前而忧郁烦闷，苦不堪言。
    有这样一位干部，被批准到农村劳动锻炼，于是给自己爱人刚生下的小孩命名为“小可怜”。其实“小”的并不可怜，他会是完全幸福的，而真正感到可怜的却是这“大”的。所谓“小可怜”者是在借机道出自己难言的苦衷，和抒发自己不愿与农民结合的累累情怀。
    据说，在建立人民公社的高潮中也有这样的人，心中有隐隐的忧虑。原因者何？社大官小，区长当社长，社长当队长、队员了，“降级”了，不光彩。
    据说，也有这样的个别人，担心供给制、食堂化会破坏自己优于他人的特殊生活，怕自己受不了。好像他们是天生就了一副特别柔嫩的肠肚。其实呢，他养成这副肠肚也不过是才几年工夫的事。
    翻过来看看，道理会更明显。既然把下放当农民谓之“可怜”，能上能下，亦官亦民叫做“不光彩”，那末，假如让其步步“高升”，永远“官”下去、永远过着脱离人民的生活，那一定是“大高兴”“大光彩”了。这不是十足的等级观念、特权思想又能是什么呢？
    我们要建设共产主义社会，要消除一切资产阶级法权残余，消除城市与乡村，体力劳动与脑力劳动，工人与农民之间的种种差别。这是历史的必然，社会发展的规律。等级观念，是违反这客观规律的，是消灭的对象，因而，它的存在就是一种祸害。有这种思想的人无疑会在新事物面前碰壁。他们的苦恼、忧郁，也势所必然。
    目前各地已掀起了波澜壮阔的共产主义思想教育运动，等级观念及一切旧思想将要彻底破产，“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义风格将要遍地开花。这是大势所趋，我们必须投入战斗，与自己思想上的等级观念及一切旧思想决绝。这需要勇气、毅力，需要坚韧、顽强。对某些人说，还需要忍受一时的痛苦，也只有如此，根深蒂固的等级观念及一切旧思想才会最后从我们思想领域里被彻底清除。
