　　The modern opera "Old Eighth Route Army," performed in Beijing by the Nantong City Yue Opera Troupe, is a play depicting the advanced deeds of a construction worker team led by an "Old Eighth Route Army" veteran. A group of construction workers from Shanghai arrives in Nantong to build workshops. However, upon reaching the construction site, the project plan is changed, and the commencement is postponed for three months. Zeng Weimin, the site director and an Old Eighth Route Army veteran, in order to avoid idling, proposes to persuade the agricultural cooperative to advance its construction of a water gate during these three months. Through a debate, we see that Zeng Weimin has the socialist construction in mind. He does not want to idle, wasting precious time that can be used to build the motherland. He considers the importance of the water gate to socialist construction and doesn't care about the small budget or whether it is "worth it." On the other hand, the technician Li Feng only sees the gains and losses of his own construction team. This debate clearly distinguishes between communist ideology and individualism.

　　Zeng Weimin and his construction workers prove through their actions that they do not lack the perseverance and boldness needed to follow the path of communism. A series of difficulties stand in the way of these people who do not crave ease, do not keep to their "own business," and are wholeheartedly committed to communist endeavors, but they resolutely carry on. The scene of transporting the rafts of timber is particularly moving. The river is about to freeze, and the rafts are still at the estuary. Xia Cunying, a female cadre sent to work at the grassroots level, volunteers to urge the timber rafts onward, working alongside Old Jiang, Old Ji... and several other workers. It is New Year's Eve, with a north wind blowing and ice floes blocking the way in the river. They have to break the ice as they move forward. Even the members of the agricultural cooperative have stopped working to celebrate the New Year, but they are fighting through the night for the water gate in the countryside. They sing a folk song:

　　Keep working hard, pull the rope with strength,
　　Years of dreams will come true,
　　As long as the water gate can be built well,
　　I'm willing to spend the New Year bringing the rafts in!

　　Listening to their joyful singing while watching them work hard in the water, supporting themselves and straining to pull the rafts from the shore, the audience cannot help but be moved to tears.

　　In our social life, what are the most moving things? I think it is these people with a communist style, the ideological qualities of a communist style, and the behavior of a communist style that are the most moving. This play does not feel like dry preaching because it describes these "noble qualities of ordinary people." There is another part of the play that is also impressive. During the construction of the water gate, the peasants tirelessly carry earth day and night and are extremely exhausted. One night, Zeng Weimin advocates that the peasants should rest. However, the water gate must be rushed, so after the peasants leave, Zeng Weimin tells everyone the story of his persistence in fighting the enemy here in the past, inspiring everyone. These workers then enthusiastically take over the earth-carrying work from the peasants.

　　This play highlights the communist qualities of the people, convincingly educating the audience with vivid images. It moves the audience. Therefore, the transformation of the backward element Li Feng does not seem forced. The audience feels that among such people, the backward will surely progress. Zeng Weimin, the Old Eighth Route Army veteran, is well-written (although his personality is not very prominent; in this play, the enthusiastic cadre Xia Cunying and the backward technician Li Feng are more vivid). Zeng Weimin considers issues from the communist principle in every aspect, is thrifty and simple himself, and is single-mindedly devoted to work, promoting socialist construction. In our country, there are many demobilized soldiers, most of whom were originally peasants, but in the army led by the Communist Party, they accepted communist ideology. Now, after being demobilized to industrial or agricultural posts, they are like spreading seeds, carrying communist ideas to every corner of the motherland, and educating others, greatly promoting the construction of socialism. These Old Eighth Route Army veterans are respectable and lovable. I think this play can more emphatically portray Zeng Weimin as a model heroic image. In addition, the moving scenes in the latter part of the play are very persuasive to Li Feng. Therefore, the abstract sermonizing to Li Feng in the first act seems somewhat lengthy. The directing of this play could also be further refined to create more moving scenes. There are one or two flaws in the directing, such as the scene in the latter part where the workers are building the concrete foundation, and everyone lines up to dance with the iron shovels, walking in circles. This directing treatment is inconsistent with the style of the entire play; especially in front of such a theatrical-style backdrop, it seems stiff. It is good to accept tradition, but each play should have a basic tone, and choose traditional movements according to this basic tone, so that the whole play is harmonious and unified. The movements in the raft-supporting scene are not traditional movements? But the processing is harmonious and appropriate, and the audience feels that those movements are necessary rather than superfluous, real rather than exaggerated, creating a moving effect.

　　The music of this play is very creative. The general impression is that Yue Opera music excels in tenderness, but the Nantong City Yue Opera Troupe has created a new style in music according to the requirements of the content of this play, which is fresh and magnificent, with a sense of striving. The mountain songs on the rafts are loud and unrestrained, conveying the people's willingness to fight the river ice at night for socialism. It is just that playing a prelude before the opening of each act seems unnecessary.

　　It is said that when the Nantong City Yue Opera Troupe performed at various construction sites in Beijing, before and after the performances, all the actors participated in construction labor, carrying earth and moving bricks, even delivering tea and washing clothes for the workers, blending in with the workers. This working-class style has a bit of "Old Eighth Route Army" flavor. I think it is precisely this style that enables them to play those heroic figures well on stage, performing so simply and proudly.

### 可敬可爱的“老八路”

    可敬可爱的“老八路”
    张真
    南通市越剧团在首都演出的现代戏“老八路”，是一出描写一个“老八路”为首的建筑工人的先进事迹的戏。一组建筑工人从上海到南通去建筑工房。到了工地，工程计划却改变了，要推迟三个月才开工。老八路出身的工地主任曾为民，为了避免窝工，主张在这三个月里去说服农业社，把社里建造水闸的任务提前。通过一场辩论，我们看到，曾为民所看到的是社会主义建设，他不愿窝工，浪费一天可以用来建设祖国的宝贵时间。他考虑的是水闸对社会主义建设的重要性，不在乎经费少，“划不来”。而技术员李风所看到的只是自己这一小组建筑工人的得失。这一场辩论，把共产主义思想和个人主义思想，清晰地划分出来了。
    曾为民这一批建筑工人，用自己的行动证明，他们是不缺乏为走共产主义道路所需要的坚韧和魄力的。一系列的困难摆在这些不贪图安逸，不守“本分”，一心想干共产主义事业的人们前进的路上，但他们坚决地干下去了。令人感动的是运木排那一场戏。河快冻了，木排还在河口，下放的女干部夏村英自告奋勇去催木排，她同老姜，老季……几个工人一齐干。这天正是大年夜，刮着北风，河里冰块拦着路，还要一面打冰一面前进，连农业社的社员们都歇工过年了，他们却在为农村的水闸而连夜苦战。他们唱着山歌：
    加油干哪，用力纤，
    多年的愿望能实现，
    只要水闸能造好，
    我情愿木排上来过年！一面听着他们愉快的歌声，一面看到他们辛辛苦苦在水里撑，在岸上弓着身子用力拉的动作，观众是禁不住热泪盈眶的。
    在我们的社会生活中间，什么是最动人的事物？我想，这些具有共产主义风格的人们，共产主义风格的思想品质，共产主义风格的行为，就是最动人的事物。这个戏不使人觉得是干巴巴的说教，就是由于有这样一些“普通人们的高贵品质”的描写。戏中还有一个地方也是令人印象深的。在建造水闸中，农民们夜以继日地挑运土方，实在疲劳不堪了。这一夜，曾为民主张农民去休息。但水闸又必须赶工，就在农民走了以后，曾为民对大家讲他当年在这里坚持对敌斗争的故事，启发了大家，这些工人就热情地代农民挑土方了。
    这个戏，突出了人们的共产主义品质，用形象信服地教育了观众。感动了观众。于是使那个落后分子李风的转变不显得生硬，观众觉得，同这样一些人们在一起，落后的一定会进步的。曾为民这个老八路写得很好（虽然性格不很突出。这戏里，热情的下放干部夏村英和落后的技术员李风是更生动一些的），曾为民处处从共产主义原则出发去考虑问题，对自己艰苦朴素，对工作一往直前，推动了社会主义的建设。在我们国家里，有许多复员军人，他们原来大半是农民，但在共产党领导的军队里，接受了共产主义思想，如今复员到工业或农业岗位上，他们就像散播种子一样，带着共产主义思想到祖国的各个角落，又教育了其他的人们，对建设社会主义起了很大推动作用。这些老八路是很可敬、可爱的。我想，这个戏可以更加强调地刻划曾为民这个人物，使他成为一个典范的英雄形象。另外，这个戏的后部，那些动人的场面对李风是很有说服力的。因此，第一幕对李风的抽象说教就显得有些冗长了。这个戏的导演上还可以更多加一加工，那就会创造出更多的动人场面来。导演上有一两处败笔，是在后部工人筑混凝土基，大家排队舞铁锨，走圆场处。这里的导演处理，与全剧的风格不谐和；特别是在那样话剧风格的布景前面，显得生硬。接受传统是好的，但每个戏要有一个基本调子，按照这个基本调子去选择传统动作，就能使全剧谐和而统一。这个戏的撑木排处的动作，何尝不是传统动作？但处理得谐和、熨贴，观众就觉得那些动作是必要的而不是多余的，是真实的而不是虚夸的，造成了感动人的效果。
    这个戏音乐上有很好的创造。一般人的印象，越剧音乐是以缠绵见长的，南通市越剧团却根据这个戏的内容的要求，在音乐上创造了新的风格，清新壮丽，有一种奋发的情绪。木排上的山歌高亢飘洒，传达出了人们乐于为社会主义夜战河冰的心情。只是每一幕开幕前都先奏一段序乐，显得不很必要。
    听说，南通市越剧团在北京各建筑工地演出时，演戏前后，他们全体演员都去参加建筑劳动，挑土搬砖，甚至替工人送茶水、洗衣服，与工人打成一片，这种工人阶级的作风，是很有些“老八路”味的。我想，正是他们这种作风，使他们在台上能演好那些英雄人物，演得那么朴质而又自豪。
