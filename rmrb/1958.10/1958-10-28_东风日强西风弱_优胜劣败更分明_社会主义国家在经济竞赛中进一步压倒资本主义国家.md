    The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind; Superiority and Inferiority Become More Distinct
    Socialist Countries Further Overwhelm Capitalist Countries in the Economic Race
    The current proportion of industrial output of socialist countries in the world's total industrial output has increased from about 33% last year to 38% to 40%
    Xinhua News Agency, 27th Dispatch: A Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary: The economic development of socialist countries in the past year or so further shows that the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind. During this period, the capitalist world began a serious cyclical economic crisis, while the economies of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have prospered and soared unprecedentedly. The scale of national economic construction and the speed of industrial development have exceeded those of previous years. According to statistics, the current proportion of industrial output of socialist countries in the world's total industrial output has increased from about 33% last year to 38% to 40%. This should be said to be a leap forward in development.
    From last year to now, the superiority and inferiority of the economic competition between the two world systems have become more obvious. Due to the impact of the economic crisis, the growth rate of the entire capitalist world's industry slowed from 4.5% in 1956 to 2% last year. However, the industrial output of socialist countries increased by about 9% last year. If the industrial development speed of socialist countries was more than twice as fast as that of capitalist countries in 1937-1956, then it was about three and a half times faster last year. This difference in speed will be further deepened this year.
    1958 is a year of unprecedented economic prosperity for socialist countries. A series of major measures taken by these countries recently to develop the national economy have yielded obvious results. In terms of industry, according to existing materials, since the beginning of this year, the industrial production of these countries has increased by about 10%, more than ten percent, or even dozens of percent, respectively, compared with the same period last year. In the Soviet Union, due to the implementation of measures such as reorganizing the management of industry and construction, the industrial production situation this year is unprecedentedly good, with the total output value in the first nine months increasing by 10% compared with the same period last year. In the first nine months of this year, all national economic sectors in Czechoslovakia overfulfilled their production plans, and the coal mining industry achieved its greatest success in more than a decade. The working people of Democratic Korea rode on the Chollima this year, engaging in industrial construction with great enthusiasm and unprecedented speed, and industrial production in the first nine months of this year increased by 34% compared with the same period last year. Production in various sectors of Hungary has been more balanced than in the past, and the average daily output of state-owned industries in the first three quarters of this year increased by 13% compared with the whole of last year. In the first three quarters of this year, industrial production in the German Democratic Republic increased by 11% compared with the same period last year, and the development speed was almost twice as fast as originally planned.
    This year, the scale of capital construction in socialist countries has exceeded that of previous years. The Soviet Union's capital construction investment this year is almost equal to 3.3 times the total investment during the entire first five-year plan period. The scale of industrial construction is unprecedentedly large, and a large amount of new production capacity in all sectors has been put into production. This year, Democratic Korea launched a mass movement to run local industries on a nationwide scale. More than 960 factories were built in various places in the third quarter alone. Since the beginning of this year, construction workers from the Ministry of Construction and Building Materials Industry of Poland have built 223 new industrial enterprises. Albania's construction projects this year are 27% more than last year.
    On the agricultural front, the achievements of socialist countries this year are also extremely encouraging. Due to the reorganization of machine tractor stations, collective farms in the Soviet Union have become more consolidated and developed organizationally, economically, and in terms of material and technical equipment since the beginning of this year. Agricultural collectivization in many socialist countries has also developed rapidly. The constantly developing and consolidating socialist agricultural system guarantees the upsurge of agricultural production in these countries. The entire agriculture of the Soviet Union has achieved an unprecedented harvest this year. This year, the total increase in agricultural production in Czechoslovakia will exceed the sum of the growth rates of the past four years. The total grain output of the German Democratic Republic increased by 12% compared with last year, and the output of milk, pork, and eggs may complete or approach the original production targets for 1960 this year. This year, the total grain output of Democratic Korea has exceeded the 1961 level, and the output of seed cotton has jumped to ten times that of last year, which is more than twice the planned output for 1961.
    In stark contrast to the rapid economic development of socialist countries is that almost all capitalist countries are mired in an increasingly serious economic crisis. Their entire petroleum industry, shipbuilding industry, ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industry, and coal mining industry have experienced serious production "surpluses." Industrial production in almost all countries has declined to varying degrees. In the United States, there has been an unprecedented phenomenon of insufficient utilization of industrial equipment since the beginning of this year. According to American newspapers, the total amount of industrial investment for the whole year will decrease by at least 13%. Its industrial production decreased by 3.1% in the second half of last year compared with the first half of the year. Due to the further deepening of the economic crisis, it decreased by 11% in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. Among them, important industrial sectors such as steel, coal mining, and automobiles have reduced production even more severely. In the first eight months of this year, US steel production decreased by about 35% compared with the same period last year. The UK's industrial production index in August fell by four to five points compared with August last year. The British "Financial Times" believes that "British industry will face the most serious recession in 20 years this autumn." West Germany's steel production fell last month to its lowest level since February 1956.
    The results of the economic competition between the two world systems show that the day when the socialist camp catches up with and absolutely overwhelms the capitalist world not only in terms of production growth rate but also in terms of total production is not far off.

    东风日强西风弱　优胜劣败更分明
    社会主义国家在经济竞赛中进一步压倒资本主义国家
    目前社会主义国家的工业产量在全世界工业总产量中所占比重，已经由去年的33％左右提高到38％到40％
    新华社27日讯　新华社记者述评：最近一年多来社会主义国家经济的发展情况进一步表明，东风继续压倒西风。在这一时期，资本主义世界开始了严重的周期性经济危机，而苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家的经济却空前繁荣高涨，国民经济建设规模和工业发展速度都超过往年。据统计，目前社会主义国家的工业产量在全世界工业总产量中所占的比重，已经由去年的33％左右提高到38％到40％。这应该说是一个飞跃的发展。
    从去年到现在，两个世界体系经济竞赛的优胜劣败的局面更加明显了。由于经济危机的影响，去年整个资本主义世界工业的发展速度从1956年的4.5％降低到2％。然而，社会主义国家的工业产量在去年就增加了大约9％。如果说在1937—1956年，社会主义国家的工业发展速度比资本主义国家快一倍多，那么，去年就快三倍半左右。今年，这种快慢的差别还将进一步加深。
    1958年是社会主义国家经济空前繁荣的一年。这些国家最近时期以来采取的发展国民经济的一系列重大措施，已经获得了明显的结果。在工业方面从现有材料看，今年以来，这些国家的工业生产都分别比去年同期增加约百分之十、十几甚至几十。在苏联，由于实行了改组工业和建筑业的管理工作等措施，今年工业生产情况空前良好，头九个月总产值就比去年同期增加了10％。今年头九个月，捷克斯洛伐克的所有国民经济部门都超额完成了生产计划，煤矿工业更获得了十多年来最大的成就。民主朝鲜的劳动人民今年骑上了千里马，以很大的干劲和空前的速度大搞工业建设，今年头九个月的工业生产比去年同期增加了34％。匈牙利各部门的生产进行得比过去均衡了，今年头三季国营工业的平均日产量比去年全年增加了13％。民主德国今年头三季工业生产比去年同期增加11％，发展速度几乎比原计划快一倍。
    今年，各社会主义国家的基本建设规模超过了往年。苏联今年的基本建设投资几乎等于整个第一个五年计划期间投资总额的三点三倍，工业建设规模空前地大，所有部门都有大量新的生产能力投入生产。民主朝鲜今年展开了全民大办地方工业的运动，单在第三季度各地兴建起来的工厂就有九百六十多个。今年以来，波兰建筑和建筑材料工业部的建筑工人已经建成了二百二十三个新的工业企业。阿尔巴尼亚今年的建设工程比去年多27％。
    在农业战线上，社会主义国家今年的成就也极为振奋人心。由于改组了机器拖拉机站，苏联的集体农庄今年以来从组织上、经济上和物质技术装备上都更加巩固和发展了。许多社会主义国家的农业合作化又有了迅速的发展。不断发展和巩固的社会主义农业制度保证了这些国家农业生产的高涨。苏联的整个农业今年获得了空前未有的丰收。今年捷克斯洛伐克农业的总增产额将超过已往四年增长率的总和。民主德国的谷物总产量比去年增加了12％，牛奶、猪肉、鸡蛋的产量在今年就有可能完成或者接近完成1960年的原订生产指标。民主朝鲜今年粮食总产量已经超过1961年水平，籽棉产量跃增为去年的十倍，比1961年的计划产量还多一倍。
    同社会主义国家经济的这种飞速发展成强烈对比的是：几乎所有资本主义国家都陷入了日益严重的经济危机，它们的整个石油工业、造船业、黑色和有色金属冶炼业和采煤工业发生了严重的生产“过剩”。几乎所有国家的工业生产都有程度不等的下降。美国，今年以来发生了工业设备空前开工不足的现象，据美国报刊报道，今年全年的工业投资总额至少要减少13％。它的工业生产在去年下半年就比上半年减产了3.1％，由于经济危机的进一步加深，今年上半年就比去年同期减少了11％。其中，钢铁、采煤、汽车等重要工业部门减产得更加严重。今年头八个月美国的钢产量就比去年同期减少了约35％。英国工业8月份的生产指数比去年8月下降了四到五点。英国“金融时报”认为：“英国工业将在今年秋季面临二十年来最严重的衰退”。西德的钢产量在上月已下降到1956年2月以来最低的水平。
    两个世界体系的经济竞赛的结果表明，社会主义阵营不但在生产增长速度上、而且在生产总量上赶上和绝对压倒资本主义世界的日子，已经为期不远了。
