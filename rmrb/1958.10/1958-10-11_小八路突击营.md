    Little Eighth Route Army Assault Battalion

    The Young Pioneers of Xitianyang Primary School in Maqiao People's Commune, Tongzhou District, Beijing, responded to the call of the commune's Party organization and launched a high tide of deep plowing and fertilizer accumulation. More than eighty older members of this school formed a "Little Eighth Route Army Assault Battalion," with a headquarters and a logistics department, eating and living collectively, so that both production and study were not neglected. After five and a half days of hard work, they deep-plowed one mu of satellite experimental field to a depth of seven feet, helped the commune deep-plow eight mu of wheat land, and accumulated more than 4 million jin of fertilizer.

    Now, this "Little Eighth Route Army Assault Battalion" is continuing to advance towards deep plowing of wheat land.

    小八路突击营
    北京市通州区马桥人民公社西田阳中小学少先队响应公社党组织的号召，掀起深翻地、积肥的热潮。这所学校年龄较大的八十多名队员组成了一个“小八路突击营”，设有司令部、后勤部，集体吃、集体住，做到生产学习两不误。他们经过五天半的苦战，深挖七尺的卫星试验田一亩，帮助公社深挖麦地八亩，积肥四百多万斤。
    现在，这支“小八路突击营”，正继续向深翻麦地进军。
