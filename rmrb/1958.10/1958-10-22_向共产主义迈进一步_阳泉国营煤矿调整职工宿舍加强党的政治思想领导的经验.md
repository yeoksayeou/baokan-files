Taking a Step Towards Communism
—The Experience of Yangquan State-Owned Coal Mine in Adjusting Employee Dormitories and Strengthening the Party's Political and Ideological Leadership
The Communist Party Committee of Yangquan City

During the rectification movement, the Yangquan State-Owned Coal Mine adjusted employee dormitories according to the production organization. Leading cadres and employees of the same production unit, along with their families, were concentrated in the same living quarters. Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations also moved their offices to the dormitory areas. A complete set of systems was established to conduct political and ideological work and political, technical, and cultural education for the workers. The Party's political and ideological work was comprehensively and effectively strengthened, rapidly changing the political and ideological outlook and the mental state of workers and their families. The capitalist evil winds and noxious influences greatly decreased, and the communist uprightness greatly increased. Leading cadres and the masses of workers truly became one, establishing an equal relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation, further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. On this basis, organization militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization were implemented. All these laid a good foundation for the establishment of a mining area people's commune.

The Problem of Scattered Housing

Before liberation, Yangquan State-Owned Coal Mine had almost no worker dormitories. The vast majority of workers had to travel several miles, even ten or twenty miles, to nearby rural areas for lodging. After liberation, based on the development of production, 234,000 square meters of employee housing were gradually constructed, and more than 28,000 employees moved into the new dormitories, fundamentally changing the living conditions of the workers. However, since the dormitories were built gradually and the workers moved in successively, the workers of each mine pit and each workshop lived in a very mixed and scattered manner. On the one hand, several workshops and several mine pits' workers lived in one dormitory. On the other hand, workers from one workshop and one team were scattered throughout the mining area, even several miles or more than ten miles apart. Therefore, when workers got off work and went home, they were "scattered like flowers," making it difficult to conduct organized activities. The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League mainly did their work during the hour or two before or after work. Because the time was short and the tasks were many, much work could not be carried out well. The Party class education system was also difficult to maintain. Mass cultural and recreational activities could not be developed. The Party's political and ideological work could only manage the workers' production activities and not their leisure activities. "Workers are the working class while on the job, but become free citizens after work." Many problems in workers' lives could not be resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Because the Party's political and ideological leadership over workers and their families could not be effectively and comprehensively strengthened, leading personnel could not closely contact the masses. The socialist atmosphere in the employee dormitory area was thin, and capitalist ideas took the opportunity to enter. Many workers were picky about jobs and made trouble over grades, wages, treatment, and welfare. In 1956, some young workers even "made trouble" over job selection and wage disputes. Some workers indulged in excessive eating and drinking, pursued low-level interests, read pornographic novels, and some even engaged in illicit relationships, embezzlement, and theft. Some workers also engaged in speculative business, absenteeism, and feigning illness to get "labor insurance." Many family members also developed hedonistic ideas, eating and dressing well, and wandering around. Some women casually married and divorced in order to swindle workers' property. All kinds of bad elements also took the opportunity to carry out activities, write reactionary slogans, spread anti-Party and anti-socialist rhetoric, sow discord between leaders and the masses, create accidents, and sabotage production.

The coal mine party organization had noticed the many problems caused by the scattered residence of employees. It had also adjusted dormitories in some pits and districts. However, at that time, the understanding of this issue was insufficient, the determination was not strong, and it was not carried through to the end. During the rectification movement, the Party Central Committee raised the issue of enabling cadres to truly go among the masses to lead them, which greatly inspired us. From the memories of the life-and-death, shared-fate relationship between the Party and the masses during the past revolutionary war, we deeply felt that living with the masses was a major measure to fundamentally change the relationship between leaders and the masses and strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership. At the same time, the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers was unprecedentedly improved, and they urgently demanded to overcome the confusion in their lives and strengthen political, cultural, and technical learning. After careful analysis of the above situation, the Municipal Party Committee believed that the key issue was the incompatibility of the living organization with the production organization. In order to thoroughly solve this problem, it was decided to adjust the dormitories according to the production organization. At the same time, all factory and mine leading cadres were required to take the lead in moving into the employee dormitory area as ordinary laborers and settling down. Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League leaders all moved their offices to the employee dormitories. The Party organizations of the state-owned coal mines resolutely implemented this instruction of the Municipal Party Committee, closely relied on the masses to solve several ideological and practical problems in adjusting dormitories, and thus the problem of adjusting employee dormitories was successfully resolved.

Unifying Production Organization with Living Organization

Adjusting dormitories is to rearrange and divide the employee housing areas according to the production organization, so that cadres, workers, Party members, Communist Youth League members, and their families from the same pit team or workshop are concentrated in the dormitory area of their unit according to shifts, work sections, and teams. In this way, the workers' housing is completely unified with the production organization. It is both a production organization and a living organization. The Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations manage both production and life education. Each workshop, work section, and team, whether in the production front line or in the living rear, are organized like an army, overcoming the shortcomings of scattered worker housing and separation of cadres and workers in the past. When adjusting dormitories and concentrating housing, the majority of workers and their families actively supported and endorsed it, but many workers and their families also had concerns and resistance. The Party organizations of each mine made thorough plans, made overall arrangements, and fully mobilized the masses to speak out and debate. Leading cadres, Party members, and Communist Youth League members took the lead in moving. They organized the masses to help each other and promptly and quickly solved the practical difficulties of the masses, such as establishing primary schools, canteens, and grain and vegetable supply points, and successfully completed this task.

While adjusting dormitories and concentrating housing, the system of Party, labor union, and Communist Youth League cadres working in the dormitory area was implemented. In addition to participating in physical labor and conducting political mobilization with workers during the production process, the Party's political and ideological work is mainly carried out in the dormitory area. Cadres not only go to live among the masses and implement the "five togethers," but also greatly strengthen political and ideological work in daily life. In this way, the Party's grass-roots organization takes the dormitory as a position and comprehensively leads the production, life, and education work of the workers.

On the basis of adjusting dormitories and office work, Party members and Communist Youth League members among employee families were also reorganized into groups based on workshops and pit teams, and Party and Communist Youth League organizations were established under the direct leadership of the mine pit Party general branch. At the same time, under the unified leadership of the workshop and mine pit Party general branch, a dormitory management committee, a mediation committee, and a family committee were established. The dormitory management committee is an administrative organization and also has the nature of a political power. It is mainly responsible for adjusting housing, managing the distribution of dormitory utensils, handling guest registration, managing food, public security and defense, sanitation, and other tasks. The mediation committee is also an agency of political power, and it is mainly responsible for mediating disputes between employees and their families and minor illegal activities. The family committee is mainly responsible for the propaganda, education, and organization of production and other tasks for family members. In this way, all the work in the employee dormitory area is under the unified leadership and management of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels.

On the basis of adjusting dormitories, political, theoretical, cultural, technical education, and recreational and sports activities were comprehensively organized and carried out with the workshop as a unit and the dormitory as a position. Various teams, troupes, choirs, art, creation, communication, blackboard newspapers, reading newspapers, propaganda and mobilization, book and newspaper distribution, and other organizations of each workshop were successively established. Some workshops also established workers' theory study classes. After learning from the experience of "three schools, three days, one department, and two rooms," not only were the original organizations further developed and consolidated, but also Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, red and expert schools, current affairs lecture stations, clubs, libraries, exhibition sheds (rooms), sports fields, science popularization associations, and sports associations were established in the dormitory positions of each workshop. In order to adapt to various activities, each workshop uniformly arranged the time so that all employees participated in political and cultural learning, and most workshops have formed a lively political situation.

On the basis of adjusting dormitories, the organization militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization were comprehensively promoted. Party and government organizations at all levels were unified with military organizations, and some demobilized military cadres and veterans were selected to serve as deputy positions and were responsible for military training. In this way, the employee dormitory is not only a workshop and a school, but also a barracks and a training ground. Now workers' attendance at work, dismissal, meetings, and studies all reflect a high degree of organization and discipline, greatly improving attendance and productivity. In addition, under the unified leadership of the workshop Party organization, employee families are organized to actively participate in production, and more than forty satellite factories such as lime, cement, sewing, laundry, and coal selection, as well as corresponding various public collective welfare undertakings such as collective canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, have been established. More than 2,000 employee families have been liberated from household chores.

New Moral Customs are Flourishing

Due to the adjustment of dormitories according to the production organization and the comprehensive strengthening of the Party's political and ideological work with the dormitory as a position, profound and tremendous changes have taken place in production, life, and the political and ideological spirit of employees.

First, the relationship between people within the enterprise has been further adjusted. Cadres and the masses truly achieved eating, living, and laboring together, treating each other equally, and becoming one. This changed the phenomenon that some workers in the past thought that cadres were "officials," unwilling to speak, unwilling to express opinions, afraid of criticism, and separated from top to bottom. Now workers discuss things with cadres, speak out, express opinions, and are also very considerate and take care of cadres, as close as a family. Workers said: "In the past, I thought that being a cadre was just sitting in the office drinking water and reading newspapers, pointing fingers, but I didn't know that cadres were so worried, it's really not easy to be a cadre!" Cadres and the masses of workers are comrades-in-arms in production and friends in life, helping each other, overcoming difficulties, and the spirit of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation is greatly promoted. The selfish, departmental, and backward concepts such as kinship, region, and sectarianism among some workers have been greatly reversed. They take care of each other, are considerate, and show a high degree of class emotion. Zhang Baoniu, a worker from the maintenance team of the Fourth Mine, injured his leg and could not work for a long time. Worker Wang Jiyuan brought him food, washed his clothes, and poured his stool and urine, and served him diligently until he recovered.

Second, the socialist and communist ideological consciousness and moral customs among employees and their families are growing vigorously. "I for everyone, everyone for me" has become the criterion of thought and action for the broad masses. In production and labor, regardless of remuneration, regardless of personal safety, exert as much strength as possible, and work as much time as possible. If something happens in one factory, many factories will support it, and others' difficulties are their own difficulties. The communist moral customs of patriotism, love for the factory, cherishing public property, and picking up money and not pocketing it have become a common practice and are popularized in various mines. Conversely, phenomena such as feigning illness, absenteeism, corruption, depravity, embezzlement, theft, fighting, and other violations of laws and disciplines have been greatly reduced or have disappeared. At the same time, the atmosphere of workers learning politics and theory has become stronger than before. Basically, every family has newspapers, everyone has books to read, the environment is politicized, and the dormitory is libraried. All these are marking a great upsurge in the communist ideology of the working class, which is conducive to greatly accelerating the socialist construction and the process of transition to communism.

Third, adjusting dormitories has made the organization militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization closely integrated with the workshop's production, life, and education, truly achieving both work, study, and military affairs, which has organized the worker team into an organized and disciplined combat whole, greatly promoting the continuous upsurge of production and learning. The attendance rate of employees in various mines has generally increased from about 80% last year to more than 90%. In April, the electromechanical workshop of the Third Mine had three no's: no absenteeism, no accidents, and no work-related injuries. With the collectivization of life and the general establishment of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, a large number of employee families' labor forces have been liberated, increasing a labor army. The participation of family members in production is not only of important practical significance for the development of production, but also of great significance for changing social customs and establishing a communist new life. According to the investigation of some workshops, after family members participated in production, their ideological awareness rapidly improved, their labor concept and collective concept were greatly strengthened, and the relationship between family, husband and wife, and neighbors has greatly improved.

Fourth, it has created an organizational foundation and favorable conditions for factories to run education. Since production and housing are completely unified, from workshops and mine pits to mines and factories to mining bureaus, kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools, red and expert schools, technical schools, technical schools, colleges, and universities are run at all levels, achieving all-party and all-people education. This has changed the narrow situation in the past where only factories and mines and mining bureaus ran schools, and workshops and mine pits did not run schools. At the same time, running education at different levels can closely integrate education with production and work, greatly reducing the contradiction between employees participating in learning and participating in production and political activities in the past. The time for spare-time education has been fully guaranteed, and it can also give full play to the educational forces among the employees, and organize all people who can carry out education, so that everyone is educated and everyone is a teacher. This overcomes the difficulty of the lack of teachers and promotes the implementation of popular education.

Fifth, adjusting dormitories according to the production organization and establishing residential areas are not only conducive to developing production and popularizing education, but also conducive to the management of the masses' lives, which provides a new way for the construction and transformation of factories and cities.

The above-mentioned conditions have directly made important preparations for the establishment of people's communes in coal mining areas. Now we are further exploring and solving the relevant issues and specific practices of establishing people's communes in urban factories and mines.

    向共产主义迈进一步
    ——阳泉国营煤矿调整职工宿舍加强党的政治思想领导的经验
    中共阳泉市委会
    整风运动中，阳泉国营煤矿按照生产组织进行了职工宿舍的调整。把同一生产单位的领导干部和职工及其家属集中到了一起住宿。党、工、团组织也搬到宿舍区办公。并且建立了一整套向职工群众进行政治思想工作和政治、技术、文化教育的制度。全面有效地加强了党的政治思想工作，迅速改变了职工及其家属的政治思想面貌和精神面貌。资本主义的歪风邪气大大下降，共产主义的正气大大上升。领导干部同职工群众真正打成了一片，建立了平等的互助合作关系，进一步密切了党与群众的联系。并在此基础上实行了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化。所有这些都为建立矿区人民公社奠定了良好的基础。
    居住分散问题多
    阳泉国营煤矿在解放以前，几乎没有工人宿舍，绝大部分工人要跑好几里路，甚至一、二十里路程到附近农村住宿。解放后，在生产发展的基础上，逐步建设了二十三万四千平方公尺的职工宿舍，有二万八千多职工陆续迁进了新宿舍，根本改变了职工的居住条件。但是，由于宿舍是逐步建设起来的，职工也是陆续迁进去的，所以各个矿坑，各个车间的工人住的非常杂乱分散。一方面，在一个宿舍内住着几个车间、几个矿坑的工人。另一方面，一个车间、一个小组的工人却分散住宿在全矿区的各个角落，甚至有的相距数里或十里以上。因此，工人一下工回家后，就“散了花”，很难再进行有组织的活动。党、政、工、团主要是利用上工前或下工后的个把钟头做工作。因为时间短，任务多，许多工作不能很好地开展。党课教育制度也难于坚持。群众性的文化娱乐活动也开展不起来。党的政治思想工作，只能管工人的生产活动，不能管工人的工余活动。“工人上了班是工人阶级，下了班就成了自由民”。工人生活中的许多问题不能及时适当解决。由于不能有效地全面地加强党对工人及其家属的政治思想领导，领导人员不能密切地和群众联系。在职工宿舍区域社会主义空气稀薄，资本主义思想就趁机而入。不少工人挑工种、闹级别、工资、待遇和生活福利等问题。1956年有些青年工人为挑工种、争工资，还发生了“闹事”。有些工人回到宿舍后，大吃二喝，追求低级趣味，看黄色小说，甚至有些职工乱搞男女关系、贪污、偷盗。也有些工人做投机生意，旷工装病吃“劳保”。许多家属也滋长了享乐思想，好吃好穿，东游西逛。有的妇女为了骗取工人的财物，随便结婚离婚。各种各样的坏分子也趁机进行活动，写反动标语，散布反党反社会主义言论，挑拨领导与群众的关系，制造事故，破坏生产。
    由于职工群众居住杂乱而产生的许多问题，煤矿党组织过去就有所觉察，也曾在部分坑、区进行过宿舍调整。但是当时对这一问题认识不足，决心不大，没有进行到底。整风运动中，党中央提出了使干部真正到群众中间去领导群众的问题，对我们启发很大。使我们从过去革命战争时期党与群众那种生死与共，休戚相关的血肉关系的回忆中，深深地感觉到和群众生活在一起，是从根本上改变领导与群众关系，加强党的政治思想领导的一项重大措施。同时，广大职工群众的思想觉悟空前提高，他们迫切要求克服生活当中存在的混乱现象，加强政治、文化、技术学习。市委对于上述情况进行了认真的分析以后，认为关键问题在于生活组织与生产组织的不相适应。为了彻底解决这一问题，确定按照生产组织进行宿舍调整。同时要求所有厂矿领导干部都要以普通劳动者的姿态带头搬进职工宿舍区安家落户。党、工、团领导一律搬到职工宿舍办公。各国营煤矿党组织坚决贯彻执行了市委这一指示，紧紧依靠群众解决了调整宿舍中的若干思想问题和实际问题，因而职工宿舍的调整问题就顺利地得到了解决。
    把生产组织同生活组织统一起来
    调整宿舍是按照生产组织，重新安排和划分职工群众的住宿区，使同一坑队、车间的干部、工人、党员、团员及其家属按照班次、工段、小组集中住宿在本单位的宿舍区。这样，工人的住宿就同生产组织完全统一起来了。既是生产组织，也是生活组织。党、政、工、团组织既管生产，也管生活教育。各个车间、工段、小组不论是生产前线，也不论是生活后方，都如同军队一样地组织了起来，克服了过去工人居住分散，干部和工人分居的缺点。在调整宿舍集中住宿的时候，大部分职工群众及其家属是积极支持和拥护的，但也有不少职工和家属有所顾虑和抵触。各矿党组织通过周密计划，统筹安排和充分发动群众鸣放辩论。领导干部、党员、团员以身作则带头搬家；组织群众互相帮助，并适时迅速地解决群众的实际困难，如建立小学校、食堂、粮菜供应点等工作，顺利地完成了这一任务。
    在宿舍调整集中住宿的同时，实行了党、工、团干部到宿舍区办公制度。党、工、团干部除在生产过程中同工人一道参加体力劳动和进行政治鼓动以外，党的政治思想工作主要在宿舍区来进行。干部们不仅到群众中去安家落户，实行“五同”；而且大大加强了日常生活当中的政治思想工作。这样党的基层组织就以宿舍为阵地，把职工群众的生产、生活和教育工作全面领导起来了。
    在调整宿舍和工房办公的基础上，职工家属中的党员、团员也以车间、坑队为单位重新编组，建立了党、团组织，直接受矿坑党总支的领导。同时还在车间、矿坑党总支的统一领导下，建立了宿舍管理委员会、调处委员会和家属委员会。宿舍管理委员会是行政组织，又带有政权性质，它主要是担负调剂房屋，管理领发宿舍的用具、办理来客登记、管理伙食、治安保卫、清洁卫生等各项工作。调处委员会也是政权性质的机构，它主要是担负调处职工及其家属纠纷和轻微的违法行为的工作。家属委员会主要是担负对家属的宣传、教育和组织生产等各项工作。这样就把职工宿舍区域的所有一切工作都由各级党、政、工、团组织统一领导管理起来。
    在调整宿舍的基础上，以车间为单位，以宿舍为阵地，全面组织与开展了政治、理论、文化、技术教育和文娱体育活动，陆续建立了各个车间的各种球队、剧团、合唱队、美术、创作、通讯、板报、读报、宣传鼓动、书报发行等各种组织。有些车间还建立了工人的理论学习班。在学习了“三校三日一部二室”的经验后，不仅更加发展和巩固了原有的组织，而且在各车间宿舍阵地上建立了党校、团校、红专学校、时事讲演站、俱乐部、图书馆、展览棚（室）、运动场和科普协会、体育协会等组织。为了适应各种活动，各车间统一安排了时间，使所有职工参加了政治、文化学习，多数车间都已经形成了生动活泼的政治局面。
    在调整宿舍的基础上，全面推行了组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化。各级党、政组织与军事组织统一起来，并选拔一部分军队转业干部和复员军人分别担任副职，负责军事教练。这样，职工宿舍不仅是工房、学校，而且又是营房和操场。现在工人上班、下班、开会学习，都体现了高度的组织性、纪律性，大大提高了出勤率和生产率。此外，在车间党组织的统一领导下，组织职工家属积极参加生产，并建立起石灰、水泥、缝纫、洗衣、选煤等卫星工厂四十余个，以及相应的各种公共集体福利事业，如集体食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等。把二千余职工家属从家务劳动中解放出来。
    新的道德风尚茁壮成长
    由于按照生产组织进行了宿舍调整，并且以宿舍为阵地全面加强了党的政治思想工作，因而在生产、生活和职工群众的政治思想精神面貌上都发生了深刻的巨大的变化。
    第一、进一步调整了企业内部人与人之间的关系。干部与群众真正做到了同食、同居、同劳动，平等相处，打成一片。这就改变了过去有些工人认为干部是“当官的”，有话不愿讲，有意见不愿提，怕批评、上下隔阂的现象。现在工人有事就和干部商量，有话就讲，有意见就提，而且对干部也很体贴照顾，亲如一家。工人说：“过去我以为当干部就是坐在办公室里喝水看报，指手划脚，哪知道干部这么操心，当个干部真不容易啊！”干部和工人群众在生产中是战友，在生活中是朋友，互相帮助，克服困难，团结友爱，互助协作的精神大大发扬起来。某些工人中自私、本位和乡亲、地域、宗派等落后观念大大有所扭转。他们互相关照、体贴入微，表现了高度的阶级感情。四矿检修组工人张保牛把腿擦伤了，长时间不能劳动，工人王计元给他端饭、洗衣、倒屎、倒尿，一直殷勤侍候到他身体复原。
    第二、职工群众及其家属中的社会主义、共产主义的思想觉悟、道德风尚，茁壮地生长起来。“我为人人、人人为我”已成为广大群众思想和行动的准则。生产劳动中，不计报酬，奋不顾身，有多大力量就使多大力量，有多少时间就工作多少时间；一厂有事，多厂支援，别人的困难就是自己的困难。爱国、爱厂、爱护公共财物和拾金不昧的共产主义道德风尚形成风气普及各矿。反之，那种装病、旷工、腐化、堕落、贪污、偷盗、打架及其它违法乱纪现象大大减少或者已经绝迹。与此同时，职工群众学政治、学理论的空气较前浓厚起来，基本上做到了家家有报纸，人人有书看，环境政治化，宿舍图书化。所有这些都在标志着工人阶级共产主义思想的大高涨，从而有利于大大加速社会主义建设事业和向共产主义过渡的进程。
    第三、调整宿舍使组织军事化、行动战斗化和生活集体化与车间的生产、生活、教育紧密结合，真正做到亦工亦学亦兵，这就把工人队伍组织成一个有组织、有纪律的战斗整体，大大推动了生产、学习的不断高涨。各矿职工的出勤率普遍由去年的80％左右，上升到90％以上。三矿机电车间在4月份出现了三无：无旷工、无事故、无公伤。随着生活集体化，普遍建立公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的结果，大批职工家属的劳动力解放出来，增加了一支劳动大军。家属参加生产不仅对发展生产具有重要现实意义，而且对改变社会风尚，建立共产主义的新生活具有重大意义。据一些车间的调查，家属参加生产后，思想觉悟迅速有了提高，劳动观念、集体观念大大加强，家庭、夫妻、邻里之间的关系有了很大的改善。
    第四、给工厂办教育创造了组织基础和有利条件。由于生产、住宿完全统一起来，从车间、矿坑，到矿厂，到矿务局，各级分别办了幼儿园、小学、中学、红专学校、技工学校、技术学校、专科、大学，做到全党全民办教育。改变了过去只由厂矿和矿务局办学校，车间矿坑不办学校的狭小局面。同时，分级办教育，可以使教育和生产、工作紧密结合，大大减少了过去职工参加学习和参加生产、政治活动的矛盾。业余教育的时间有了充分的保证，而且可以发挥职工群众中的教育力量，把一切能够进行教育的人都组织起来，做到人人受教育，人人是先生。这就克服了教师缺乏的困难，促进了普及教育的推行。
    第五、按照生产组织调整宿舍，建立住宅区，不仅有利于发展生产，普及教育，而且有利于群众的生活管理，这就给工厂、城市的建设和改造提供了新的途径。
    上述这些条件都为煤矿区建立人民公社直接做了重要的准备。现在我们正在进一步摸索解决城市厂矿中建立人民公社的有关问题和具体做法。
