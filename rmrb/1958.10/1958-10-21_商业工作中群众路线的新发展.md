    New Developments in the Mass Line in Commercial Work
    By People's Daily Commentator
    In recent years, particularly since the Rectification Campaign, commercial departments have generally promoted the "four on-the-spot" method in the purchase of agricultural products such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco, implementing the mass line work method of on-the-spot purchase at the cooperative, on-the-spot grading at the cooperative, on-the-spot storage at the cooperative, and on-the-spot delivery by the cooperative. After the establishment of the People's Communes, in the recent cotton purchase work, many areas have developed from "four on-the-spot" to "four selfs," which means the People's Commune handles self-grading, self-weighing, self-settlement, and self-storage, or directly sends the cotton to the state-designated purchasing units (processing plants, warehouses). The transition from "four on-the-spot" to "four selfs" is a new development in the mass line work method in commercial work, which will greatly promote the purchasing work.
    This year, China's cotton has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total output estimated to reach over 70 million dan (7 billion kilograms), more than double last year's output, surpassing the United States and ranking first in the world. With the bumper cotton harvest, this year's cotton purchase task will also be more than double that of last year. To complete such a large purchase task in a very short period, while simultaneously focusing on the two major tasks of steel production and autumn harvesting, planting, and plowing, we must rely on the masses and adopt new working methods.
    Now, the "four selfs" cotton purchase method points out a concrete way to solve this problem, and all localities should quickly promote it. According to the experience of Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, Jiangsu and other places, implementing this cotton purchase method has many benefits. First, it facilitates the unified arrangement of labor and livestock within the commune and speeds up the cotton sales progress. After Hongwei People's Commune in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, implemented the "four selfs" cotton purchase method, the original plan to sell all the cotton to the state in one hundred and fifty days was shortened to fifty days. Second, it simplifies the cotton purchase procedures, improves work efficiency, avoids the phenomena of complicated procedures and queuing for cotton sales in the past centralized purchases, and greatly saves the manpower and material resources of the commune and the state. Third, it can give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses and make full use of the manpower and material resources of the masses. After Wangji People's Commune in Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, promoted the "four selfs" cotton purchase method, the commune members automatically contributed 478 pieces of tarpaulins and other equipment, and vacated 260 rooms as cotton warehouses. In Wu'an County, Hebei Province, more than 12,000 cotton warehouses were built in ten days, basically achieving the goal of having warehouses in every village and cotton storage capacity in every commune.
    The promotion of the "four selfs" cotton purchase method must adhere to putting politics in command. Some cadres in the commercial departments are worried that handing over the cotton purchase work to the People's Communes will make it impossible to complete the task. They believe that if the People's Communes grade, weigh, and settle accounts by themselves, the drawbacks of overly lenient grading and insufficient weight are inevitable. In short, they have many concerns and dare not let the People's Communes handle it. In fact, these concerns reflect right-leaning conservative ideas that do not trust or rely on the masses. As a matter of fact, judging from the areas where the "four selfs" cotton purchase method has already been implemented, the People's Communes have done an excellent job in cotton purchase work. For example, the 1.24 million jin (620,000 kilograms) of cotton self-graded by the Taiyangsheng People's Commune in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, had a grade qualification rate of over 99% after a spot check and grading by the state. More than 10,000 jin (5,000 kilograms) of cotton delivered by the Hongqi People's Commune in Linqing County, Shandong Province, fully met the standards after sampling and inspection. Although some communes have some small errors in cotton purchase grading, these errors can be reduced and avoided as long as the commercial departments actively help.
    At the beginning of the implementation of the "four selfs" cotton purchase method, some commune members and cadres of the People's Communes also had concerns. For example, they believed that the purchase of cotton was a matter for the state, and handing it over to the commune would add trouble; they were afraid that the technical conditions were poor and they could not do a good job, which would let the state down; they were afraid that it would affect the commune's agricultural production, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to organize the masses to speak out and debate in response to these ideological concerns.
    To implement the "four selfs" cotton purchase method, technical skills must be taught to the masses. Wu'an County, Hebei Province, sent technical cadres deep into the communes to teach techniques through participation in production, field demonstrations, and linking theory with practice. Now, every team in the county has a grader, and every commune can inspect the cotton. In addition, commercial departments at all levels should also help the People's Communes add or produce the necessary testing instruments to facilitate the smooth progress of cotton testing work.
    At present, there is not enough experience in the methods of promoting the "four selfs" cotton purchase in various places. However, as long as we are good at taking advantage of the current favorable conditions, such as the basic realization of the people's communes in the countryside, the further improvement of the ideological awareness of the peasants, and the rich production and management experience of the peasants, and closely rely on the leadership of the Party, fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, we will surely be able to smoothly promote the "four selfs" cotton purchase method, and we will surely be able to make purchasing work leap forward again and again, and complete the cotton purchase task in a short period of time.

    商业工作中群众路线的新发展
    本报评论员
    几年来，特别是整风运动以后，商业部门贯彻群众路线的工作方法，在棉、麻、烟等农产品收购方面，普遍地推广了派人就社收购、就社验级、就社保管、就社交运的“四就”方法。在人民公社成立以后，最近在棉花收购工作中，又有不少地区在“四就”的基础上发展到由人民公社自行验级、自行过秤、自行结算、自行保管或者直接送到国家指定的收购单位（加工厂、仓库）。从“四就到”“四自”，是商业工作中群众路线工作方法的新发展，它将对采购工作发生巨大的推动作用。
    今年，我国的棉花获得了空前丰收，总产量预计可达到七千多万担，比去年增产一倍以上，压倒了美国而跃居世界第一位。随着棉花的大丰收，今年的棉花收购任务也将比去年增大一倍以上。我们要在一个很短的时期内，在抓钢铁和抓秋收秋耕秋种两大任务的同时，完成这样大的收购任务，就必须依靠群众，必须采取新的工作方法。
    现在，“四自”的收棉方法，指出了解决这个问题的具体途径，各地应当迅速地加以推广。根据河北、辽宁、山东、江苏等地的经验，实行这种收棉方法，好处很多。第一，便于在公社里统一安排劳畜力，加快售棉进度。山东高唐县宏伟人民公社实行“四自”收棉方法后，原计划要用一百五十天才能卖完的棉花，缩短到五十天就可以全部卖给国家。第二，简化了收棉手续，提高了工作效率，避免了过去集中收购手续繁多卖棉排队的现象，大大节约了公社和国家的人力物力。第三，可以发挥广大群众的积极性，充分利用群众的人力物力。江苏泗阳县王集人民公社推行“四自”收棉办法后，社员自动拿出苫垫和其他器材四百七十八件，腾出房屋二百六十间做棉花仓库。河北武安县在十天当中就办起一万二千多间棉花仓库，基本上做到了村村有仓库，社社能存棉。
    推行“四自”收棉方法必须坚持政治挂帅。商业部门有些干部耽心把棉花收购工作交给人民公社，不能完成任务。认为人民公社自行验级、过秤和结算，难免不发生验级偏宽、重量不足的弊病。总之，他们顾虑重重，不敢放手让人民公社来搞。其实，这些顾虑正反映了不相信群众和不依靠群众的右倾保守思想。事实上，从已经推行“四自”收棉方法的地区来看，人民公社对棉花收购工作做得是很出色的。例如，辽宁盖平县太阳升人民公社自行验级的一百二十四万斤棉花，经过国家抽查验级，等级合格达99％以上。山东临清县红旗人民公社送交棉花一万多斤，经抽查验收，等级完全合乎标准。有些公社收棉验级虽有一些小的误差，但商业部门只要积极加以帮助，误差是可以减少和避免的。
    在开始实行“四自”收棉方法的时候，人民公社一部分社员群众和干部也是有顾虑的。比如，认为收购棉花是国家的事，交给公社，添麻烦；怕技术条件差，搞不好，对不起国家；怕影响社里农业生产等等。因此，必须针对这些思想顾虑，组织群众鸣放辩论。
    实行“四自”收棉方法，必须把技术教给群众，河北武安县派出技术干部深入到社，通过参与生产、田间表演、理论联系实际的方法传授技术，现在全县已经队队都有分级员，社社会检验了。此外，各级商业部门还要帮助人民公社添置或制作必要的检验仪器，以利棉花检验工作的顺利进行。
    当前各地推广“四自”收棉的方法，经验还不够多。但是，只要我们善于利用目前农村基本实现了人民公社化、农民思想觉悟进一步提高、农民群众有丰富的生产管理经验等有利条件，紧紧依靠党的领导，充分发动群众和依靠群众，就一定可以顺利地推行“四自”收棉方法，就一定可以使采购工作跃进再跃进，在较短的时期内完成购棉任务。
