Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 25th: Geology faculty and students from Nanjing University, during field surveys, discovered that beneath a large area of land within Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces, in addition to abundant mineral deposits, there is also a vast underground sea. Simultaneously, they discovered an ancient Yangtze River channel.

This underground sea is composed of thick, loose Quaternary soil deposited 25,000 years ago. It was formerly the East China Sea, which gradually silted up but still maintains deep groundwater layers. According to preliminary surveys by the Nanjing University geology faculty and students, the underground sea covers an area of approximately 200,000 square kilometers, equivalent to the area of two Jiangsu provinces. The water flow of the underground sea runs from west to east, reaching Shanghai in the east, Yixing and Huzhou in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the south, Luoshan in Henan in the west, and Zhengzhou in Henan and Xinhailian in Jiangsu in the north. Within Anhui province, the underground sea is narrower from north to south, extending only from Bengbu to Lingbi. Preliminary information suggests that the underground sea has six aquifers with an average thickness of approximately 200 meters, and a maximum thickness of 400 meters. From cross-sectional models, the shallowest water layer of the underground sea is only 2.3 meters below the surface, and some artesian heads can spout 9 meters above the ground. The water quality of the underground sea is good, and the water reserves are also very large, estimated at over four trillion tons.

The ancient Yangtze River they discovered flowed through the vicinity of Nanjing tens of thousands of years ago. The ancient river channel is located north of the current Yangtze River, and is approximately four kilometers wide, flowing eastward into the sea from present-day Yangzhou, Jiangsu province. The ancient Yangtze River water layer is sixty to one hundred meters deep. This ancient Yangtze River underground channel is still connected to the current Yangtze River through gravel layers, so it has never dried up. Its static water storage is five hundred million tons within Nanjing alone.

The discovery of the underground sea and the ancient Yangtze River provides abundant underground water resources for the development of industrial and agricultural production in Jiangsu and other provinces.

In their teaching reforms, Nanjing University geology faculty and students are production-oriented and practice-oriented. This year, more than 400 people have gone to the countryside and mountains to conduct geological surveys in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi provinces, and Shanghai. In addition to discovering the underground sea and ancient Yangtze River, they have also found more than 40 types of mineral deposits in 487 locations.

    豫皖苏发现地下海
    面积约有二十万平方公里
    据新华社南京25日电　南京大学地质系师生在实地勘察中发现，在我国江苏、河南、安徽三省境内的一大片陆地下面，除了丰富的矿藏以外，还有一个巨大的地下海，同时发现了古长江河道。
    这个地下海，是由二万五千年以前的第四纪巨厚的松软土组成，是以前的东海，后来逐渐淤填，但仍保持深厚的地下水层。地下海的面积，据南京大学地质系师生初步勘察，约有二十万平方公里，相当于两个江苏省的面积。地下海的水流是由西向东流，东到上海，南到江苏的宜兴和浙江的湖州，西到河南的罗山，北到河南的郑州和江苏新海连。在安徽境内，地下海南北较狭，只从蚌埠到灵璧。据初步了解，地下海共有六个含水层，平均厚度约二百公尺，最厚的地方有四百公尺。从剖面模型看，地下海的水层最浅的地方离地面只有二点三公尺，有的自流水头可喷出地面九公尺。地下海的水质良好，水的储量也很大，约有四万亿吨以上。
    他们发现的古长江，是几万年以前流经南京附近的长江古河道，位置在现在的长江北边，宽约四公里，从现在江苏省的扬州向东入海。古长江水层深度有六十到一百公尺。这个古长江地下河道，透过砂砾层，还和现在的长江相通，所以它一直没有干涸。它的静水储量，单南京境内就有五亿吨。
    地下海和古长江的发现，为江苏等省发展工农业生产提供了丰富的地下水源。
    南京大学地质系师生在教学改革中面向生产，面向实际，今年有四百多人下乡、上山，到江苏、浙江、安徽、福建、江西五省和上海市进行地质勘察。他们除发现地下海和古长江以外，还在四百八十七个地方找到了四十多种矿藏。地下海及古长江示意图
