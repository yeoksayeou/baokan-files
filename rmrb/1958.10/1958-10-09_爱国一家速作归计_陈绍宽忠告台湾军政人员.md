Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 8th - General Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province and former Kuomintang Navy Minister, published an article here today entitled "Love the Country, One Family, Quickly Make Plans to Return," advising Taiwan military and government personnel to take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, unite externally, and unanimously oppose the common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

The article said that Minister Peng Dehuai's message embodies the country and cares for the people, with earnest and well-meaning words that would move anyone who isn't made of wood or stone. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are Chinese territory and must return to the embrace of the motherland. We firmly oppose U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" and play the "ceasefire" trick. The U.S. military must get out of the Taiwan Strait.

The article stated that the military and civilians in the Taiwan region and we are all Chinese. Chinese affairs should be resolved by the Chinese themselves. Military and government personnel in the Taiwan region should understand the principle of "harmony is the most valuable." To not seek harmony when it is possible is to cut oneself off from the people and willingly become the sacrificial victims of U.S. imperialism's cannons.

Chen Shaokuan pointed out in his article that our people are building the motherland at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." The backward and impoverished conditions of many years have become historical relics, and the lives of the people of the motherland are getting better day by day. Taiwan is a part of the great motherland, and the military and civilians in Taiwan are our compatriots and should return to the embrace of the motherland family as soon as possible.

The article also said that many of the military and government personnel in Taiwan today are my former comrades-in-arms and old friends. I believe you are also patriotic. As a Chinese, who does not want their motherland to be prosperous and strong, and who is willing to live under someone else's roof and be at the mercy of others for a long time? In this era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, U.S. imperialism is already declining and is a paper tiger. You must not be deluded any longer. You should quickly get rid of the shackles of U.S. imperialism, resolutely take the path of peaceful liberation of Taiwan, unite externally, and unanimously oppose our common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

At the end of his article, Chen Shaokuan earnestly hoped that Taiwan's military and government personnel would make a decisive decision and make a choice as soon as possible; quickly make plans to return and no longer hesitate.

    爱国一家速作归计
    陈绍宽忠告台湾军政人员
    新华社福州8日电　福建省副省长、前国民党海军部长陈绍宽将军今天在这里以“爱国一家速作归计”为题发表文章，忠告台湾军政人员走和平解放台湾的道路，团结对外，一致反对共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    文章说，彭德怀部长的文告体国为民，语重心长，人非木石，能不动心。台、澎、金、马是中国的领土，一定要回到祖国的怀抱，我们坚决反对美帝国主义制造“两个中国”和玩弄“停火”的阴谋，美国军队一定要滚出台湾海峡。
    文章说，台湾地区的军民同胞和我们都是中国人，中国的事情应该由中国人自己来解决。台湾地区的军政人员应当懂得“和为贵”的道理，能和而不和那就是自绝于人民，甘心做美帝国主义炮火的牺牲品。
    陈绍宽在他的文章中指出，我们全国人民正以“一天等于二十年”的速度建设祖国，多少年来落后贫困的现象已成为历史陈迹，祖国人民的生活一天好似一天。台湾是伟大祖国的一部分，台湾军民是我们的同胞，应该早日回到祖国大家庭里来。
    文章还说，今天在台湾的军政人员不少人都是我往日的袍泽故旧，我相信你们也是爱国有心的。作为一个中国人，谁不希望自己的祖国繁荣富强，谁愿意长期寄人篱下，仰人鼻息。在这东风压倒西风的时代，美帝国主义已经是日落西山，是纸老虎，你们千万不能再执迷不悟，应该快快摆脱美帝国主义的羁绊，毅然走和平解放台湾的道路，团结对外，一致反对我们共同的敌人——美帝国主义。
    陈绍宽在文章的最后，热忱希望台湾军政人员，当机立断，早作抉择；速作归来之计，勿再踌躇犹豫。
