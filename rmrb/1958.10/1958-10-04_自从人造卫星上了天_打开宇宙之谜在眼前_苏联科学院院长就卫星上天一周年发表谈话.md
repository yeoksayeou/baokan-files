Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: According to TASS, the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, A. N. Nesmeyanov, gave a talk to TASS reporters on the first anniversary of the launch of the first, and also the world's first, artificial Earth satellite. He said that the launch of the first satellite opened a new era in the conquest of outer space. Now, the question of further boldly developing the conquest of interplanetary space has been put on the agenda.

Nesmeyanov said that on the road to achieving the first cosmic flight, many serious technical difficulties were encountered. To overcome these difficulties, a large number of scientists—designers, engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and astronomers—worked tirelessly for many years.

If Soviet science had not reached a high level, there would be no question of manufacturing satellites and launching them into predetermined orbits with such astonishing accuracy. This is understood by all scientists and designers in the world. Therefore, October 4, 1957, was also a day of infinitely increasing international prestige for Soviet science.

Nesmeyanov pointed out that the ionosphere plays a significant role in all problems of upper atmosphere physics, and many natural phenomena occur in this mysterious laboratory. Artificial Earth satellites—flying scientific laboratories—are sending signals by radio waves, reporting on changes occurring hundreds of kilometers above the Earth, and exploring the secrets of the ionosphere and cosmic rays. The very fact that a satellite is orbiting, and the nature of the changes in this orbit, can provide valuable material about the properties of the highest layers of the atmosphere, as well as the interplanetary medium and meteor dust. The successful launch of artificial satellites has made it possible for us to study all the mysteries of the cosmos and outer space, and to observe solar radiation for the first time. Due to the successful launch of satellites, scientists have gained a way to directly study cosmic rays emitted from the boundless and distant universe.

Understanding these phenomena is a necessary and inevitable preparation for space navigation. The creation of artificial satellites has presented us with the task of conquering interplanetary space and comprehensively studying it.

    自从人造卫星上了天  打开宇宙之谜在眼前
    苏联科学院院长就卫星上天一周年发表谈话
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫，就苏联第一个、也是世界上第一个人造地球卫星上天一周年，对塔斯社记者发表了谈话。他说，第一个卫星上天开辟了征服宇宙空间的新纪元。现在进一步勇敢发展征服行星际宇宙空间的问题已经提到日程上来。
    ?斯米扬诺夫说，在实现第一次宇宙飞行的道路上，遇到了许多严重的技术困难，为了克服这些困难，大批科学家——设计师、工程师、物理学家、数学家和天文学家曾经顽强地劳动了许多年。
    如果苏联的科学没有达到高度的水平，根本谈不到什么制造卫星和以这样惊人的准确性把卫星发射到预定的轨道上。这一点是世界所有科学家和设计师都了解的。因此，1957年10月4日也是苏联科学国际威望无限增高的一天。
    ?斯米扬诺夫指出，电离层在大气高层物理学的一切问题中起着重大的作用，在这个神秘的实验室里面发生着许多自然现象。人造地球卫星——飞行的科学实验室正在用无线电波发讯号，报告在数百公里高空中发生的变化，探索电离层和宇宙线的秘密。卫星按轨道运行这一事实本身和这个轨道变化的性质，都可以提供有关大气最高层的性质以及行星际介质和流星尘的珍贵材料。人造卫星的发射成功，使我们有可能研究宇宙和宇宙空间的一切的谜，第一次对太阳辐射进行观察。由于卫星发射成功，科学家获得了直接研究无边无际的宇宙远方发射出来的宇宙线的道路。
    了解这些现象是宇宙航行的必要的和必然的准备。人造卫星的造成给我们提出了征服行星际宇宙空间和全面研究这一空间的任务。
