Editor's Note: Changchun City has achieved remarkable success in implementing the central government's education policy. Currently, factories, schools, streets, and suburban rural areas in Changchun City are establishing socialist education systems ranging from primary school to university. Recently, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Culture and Education Department and the political and cultural education department of this newspaper jointly held a symposium to discuss the integration of education with productive labor and the issue of universalizing higher education within fifteen years. The following is a summary of the speeches made at the symposium:

    Conducting Communist Education
    Li Xianmin, Director of the Culture and Education Department of the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    The instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on education work are of great significance and create conditions for the transition to communism. To implement the central government's policy of integrating education with productive labor, it is necessary to realize factories running schools and schools running factories. Doing so prepares the conditions for the transition to communism.

    There are two fundamental conditions for realizing communism: One is the highly developed production, realizing the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." To achieve this, it is necessary to carry out a technological revolution. Without a cultural revolution, it is impossible to achieve a technological revolution, especially if workers and peasants are not raised to the level of university education, which makes it difficult for production to develop even further. The other is the change in consciousness and the transformation of people. This requires resolving the separation of physical and mental labor, eliminating the millennia-old view of belittling labor and laborers, and eliminating the opposition between urban and rural areas. This is precisely what communism seeks to solve. How to solve it? The fundamental issue is to improve culture, so that workers and peasants have a high level of culture, everyone is a college student, and everyone is a laborer, and the problem can be solved.

    To universalize higher education, it is necessary to first universalize it among workers and peasants, which is our fundamental force. To solve this problem, relying solely on public schools is not enough, and the economic strength of the state cannot do it alone. We must walk on two legs. Factories and people's communes running schools on a large scale is the only correct path to solving this problem. The Chemical Engineering College established by the Gas Company is a good example, a new type of university, and an embryo of communism. It is new in the following aspects:

    First, it has established a complete education system from primary school to university. In the past, workers who finished primary school had no middle school to attend, and those who finished middle school had no university to attend. Now it is complete, and every worker can receive higher education, everyone is a laborer, and everyone is an intellectual. This type of school is not perfect in some respects at present, but it will gradually become perfect in the future.

    Second, this approach truly integrates education with production. Running schools not only does not affect production, but also promotes production. As production develops, it in turn promotes teaching and enriches educational content. This is a thorough integration.

    Third, it combines popularization with improvement; and spare-time education with part-work, part-study. This method is suitable for the current conditions in Changchun City and makes up for the shortcomings of past spare-time education. Part-work, part-study is much better than spare-time education. There is more time, more concentrated learning, and complete learning content. However, it is still difficult to adopt part-work, part-study entirely under the current conditions of labor shortage. When solving this problem, the method of combining the part-study of factory workers with the part-work of students is very good. The principles of running schools are unified, but the forms can be diverse. Some units can gradually shift to part-work, part-study depending on the conditions.

    Fourth, this method combines politics, technology, culture, and scientific research, starting from the actual needs of production and serving production. It can comprehensively advance politics, culture, science and technology, and production. This way, it neither affects production nor improves culture.

    Fifth, this is a new development in the cooperation between factories and schools. This cooperation is becoming increasingly close, based on the communist spirit of "one for all, all for one," for the purpose of developing production and developing education.

    Implementing the central government's policy of factories running schools and schools running factories involves struggle, and it is a long-term and repeated struggle. It is necessary to struggle against all kinds of oppositionists, onlookers, regressionists, and conservative ideas. This is the development and creation of Marxist education theory in China. Those with bourgeois viewpoints and dogmatists will inevitably oppose it, and there must be struggle, otherwise new things cannot grow. Can workers and peasants attend university without formal middle school education? Can factories and rural areas run universities? Some people worry that education will be eliminated, but we say it will not. The remnants of capitalist education should be eliminated, and communist education must be developed. Facts have proved that education and production promote each other, and production during this period is developing faster than at any other time. People who are bound by old ideas can only be turned around through factual education. Of course, what we are doing now is not perfect. But the direction is correct, and if the direction is right, we will do it. We are not afraid of some shortcomings, they will be gradually solved.

### 开展共产主义教育

    编者按　长春市在贯彻执行中央的教育方针方面获得了显著的成就。现在，长春市的工厂、学校、街道和郊区的农村正纷纷建立从小学到大学的社会主义教育体系。最近中共长春市委文教部和本报政治文教部联合召开了一次座谈会，就教育结合生产劳动和争取十五年内普及高等教育问题进行座谈。现将座谈会上的发言摘要发表如下：
    开展共产主义教育
    中共长春市委文教部部长　李先民
    中共中央和国务院关于教育工作的指示意义重大，是为向共产主义过渡创造条件。贯彻中央教育与生产劳动结合的方针，就必须实现工厂办学校、学校办工厂。这样做，也就是为走向共产主义过渡准备条件。
    实现共产主义有两个根本的条件：一个是：生产高度发展，实现各尽所能、各取所需。为此就要搞技术革命。实现技术革命，没有文化革命是不行的，特别是不把工人、农民提到大学水平，生产更高度发展就较困难。另一个是意识的改变、人的改造。这就要解决体力劳动与脑力劳动的脱离，消除几千年轻视劳动、轻视劳动人民的观点，消灭城乡的对立。这正是共产主义所要解决的问题。怎么解决，根本问题是要提高文化，工人农民都有高等的文化水平，人人是大学生，人人是劳动者，问题就可以解决了。
    普及高等教育，首先要在工人、农民中普及，这是我们的根本队伍。解决它，光靠公立学校就不够了，国家经济力量办不到，必须两条腿走路。工厂、人民公社大办学校，是解决这个问题的唯一正确的道路。煤气公司创办的化工学院，是个好样子，是一个新型大学，是共产主义的萌芽。说它新，有这样几方面：
    第一，那里建立起了从小学到大学的完整教育体系。过去工人念完小学没有中学，念完中学又没有大学，现在是完整的，每个工人都能受到高等教育，人人都是劳动者，人人都是知识分子。这种学校目前在某些方面还不够完备，但将来将逐步完美起来。
    第二，这种作法使教育同生产真正的结合起来。办学校不仅不影响生产，反而推动了生产，生产发展了，反过来又推动了教学，丰富了教育内容，这是彻底的结合。
    第三，普及与提高相结合；业余教育与半工半读相结合。这种办法适合长春市当前的条件，补足了过去业余教育的缺点。半工半读比业余教育要好的多。时间多，学习集中，学习内容完整。但目前在劳动力不足的情况下，全部采取半工半读还有困难。在解决这个问题时，工厂工人的半读与学生的半工结合起来的办法很好，办学的方针是统一的，但形式可以多种多样。有些单位可以根据条件逐渐地转向半工半读。
    第四，这种办法使政治、技术、文化、科学研究结合起来，从生产实际出发，为生产服务，可以使政治、文化、科学技术、生产全面跃进，这样办，既不影响生产，又能提高文化。
    第五，这是工厂和学校合作的新发展。这种合作越来越紧密，本着我为人人，人人为我的共产主义精神，为发展生产、发展教育而合作。
    贯彻中央方针，工厂办学校，学校办工厂，是有斗争的，而且是长期反复的斗争。要和各种各样的反对派、观潮派、促退派、保守思想进行斗争。这是马克思主义教育学说在中国的发展、创造。抱有资产阶级观点和教条主义者必然要反对，这就要有斗争，不然新的东西成长不起来。工农没有经过正规中学学习，能不能上大学？工厂、农村能不能办大学？有人担心教育要消灭，我们说不会。资本主义教育的残余应该消灭，共产主义教育一定要发展。事实证明，教育同生产是相互推动的，这个时期的生产比任何时期发展都快。受旧观念束缚的人们，通过事实教育才能扭转过来。当然，现在我们办的还不是尽善尽美。但从方向看对头，对头就干，有点缺点不怕，会逐步解决的。
