Korean Poet Bids Farewell to Comrade-in-Arms

    Forever on the Same Road
    Two generals, filled with reluctance, embraced each other tightly; the silver hair of the two generals glistened with merit, their moist faces pressed close. The hearts of the people raced to Sinuiju as the two generals bid farewell at this station: "I will cherish your gift, I will remember your achievements..." "The battle is not yet over, we will forever advance on the same road..."
    One general, over the shoulder of his comrade, gazed at the blue sky of his motherland over there. The other general, also over the shoulder of his comrade, looked up at the azure sky of his own motherland... Suddenly, old words resonated in his ears... The moment when the red flag fluttered high in the smoke-filled skies of Siping Street: "I will cherish your gift, I will remember your achievements..." "The battle is not yet over, we will forever advance on the same road..."
    The two generals embraced each other forcefully, even more forcefully, tightly. Ah, looking at such a farewell, looking at such excited and beautiful hearts embracing forever, who would still feel sad or sorrowful!

    永远在一条道路上
    金鹤渊两位将军怀着难舍之情，紧紧地拥抱在一起；两位将军银发上闪烁着功勋，互相紧贴着湿润的脸庞。人们的心奔向新义州两位将军在这站台上告别：“我要珍惜你的礼物，我要记住你的功勋……”“战斗还不算结束，我们永远在一条道路上前进
    ……”一位将军越过战友的肩侧，遥望着那边祖国的蓝天。另一位将军也越过战友的肩
  侧，仰望着自己祖国的碧空，……顿时，旧话响彻耳边。……炮烟弥漫的四平街上空当红旗高高飘扬的时辰：“我要珍惜你的礼物我要记住你的功勋……”“战斗还不算结束，我们永远在一条道路上前进
    ……”两位将军有力地更有力地紧紧地拥抱在一起，呵，看着这样的离别看着这样激动而美丽的心脏永远拥抱在一起谁还会感到难过悲伤！
