Xinjiang Daily News: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has leapt forward to become the country's 100-jin-per-mu ginned cotton autonomous region. In recent days, both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains have been launching cotton "rockets" and "satellites," with the emergence of 200-jin-per-mu cotton counties and many heroic communes and farms. This is a great contribution made by farmers and farm workers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to build the autonomous region into the country's high-yield cotton planting base.

According to harvest reports from various places, this year the autonomous region's 1.85 million mu of cotton fields have an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 68.26% over the bumper harvest of 1957, with a total output of 1.85 million dan, an increase of 81% over last year. Makit County has jumped to become the autonomous region's first 200-jin-per-mu ginned cotton county, with 69,000 mu of cotton fields averaging 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, a fourfold increase over last year. Shanshan and Turpan both have an average ginned cotton yield of over 130 jin per mu. Bachu County, despite serious water shortage and alkali damage this year, achieved a yield of 118 jin per mu on its 100,000 mu of cotton fields, a fourfold increase over last year. A total of 17 counties and cities in the region have reached the level of 100 jin per mu or more. Large areas of high-yield fields and extremely high-yield fields have also emerged in various places. Preliminary statistics show that there are 300,000 mu with a yield of 200 jin to 300 jin of ginned cotton per mu; 32,000 mu of "rocket fields" with a yield of 300 jin to 1,000 jin per mu; and more than 200 mu of "satellite fields" with a yield of more than 1,000 jin of ginned cotton per mu, of which Bachu County alone has 115 mu of 1,000-jin mu.

The unprecedented brilliant achievement in cotton production in the autonomous region this year is first and foremost due to the great emancipation of thought of the whole Party and the entire people. Last winter and this spring, the mass rectification campaign was carried out in the vast rural areas. Through great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, right-leaning conservative thoughts were criticized, and the theories of backwardness and conditions were smashed, stimulating the revolutionary spirit of the masses, thereby promoting the great leap forward in cotton production. In the past six months, the miracles that have constantly emerged in agricultural production across the country and in the autonomous region, the successive ascensions of marshals, and the continuous launches of satellites have further liberated the thinking of farmers of all ethnic groups, causing cotton production targets to leap again and again, and yield-increasing measures to be added upon each other. While emancipating the mind, leaders at all levels have consistently adopted the working method of putting politics in command and following the mass line over the past year, which is also an important key to determining the bumper cotton harvest.

Another important factor in the great leap forward in cotton production is the implementation of advanced and scientific yield-increasing measures. Since last winter, various places have generally focused on basic measures such as building water conservancy projects, accumulating and producing fertilizer, promoting improved varieties, autumn plowing, land preparation, and close planting. Most cotton fields were fertilized with more than 10,000 jin per mu. Improved varieties were also used, and the seeding rate was generally 14 to 16 jin. In terms of cultivation and field management, in addition to selecting seeds and seed dressing, timely early sowing, the main focus was on the three central links of preserving seedlings, preserving flower buds, and preserving cotton bolls; and attention was paid to a series of measures such as replanting seedlings, transplanting seedlings, eliminating third-class seedlings, intertillage, weeding, rational irrigation, concentrated application of base fertilizer, topdressing in stages and batches, foliar fertilization, fertilizing according to seedling conditions, managing individual plants, pest control, and pruning, especially strengthening the late-stage field management work. This year, square-hole sowing, horizontal intertillage, horizontal thinning, infiltration irrigation, and root-cutting treatment were actively promoted, and all those who adopted these measures greatly increased their yields.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 27th: Zhejiang Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper cotton harvest. According to statistics on the 23rd of this month: in nine counties (cities), including Cixi, Xiaoshan, Yuyao, Pinghu, Shangyu, Zhenhai, Haiyan, Haining, and Hangzhou City, which account for about 90% of the total cotton area in the province, 932,000 mu of cotton fields have yielded 1,000,000 dan of ginned cotton, exceeding the total cotton output of the entire province in the bumper harvest year of 1957 by 30.3%, with an average yield of 107.3 jin per mu, an increase of 39.3% over last year. Among them, Cixi County's ginned cotton yield per mu is 118.4 jin, Xiaoshan County's ginned cotton yield per mu is 118.3 jin, and Shangyu County's ginned cotton yield per mu is 106.8 jin. The Pulian Production Team of the Changjiang People's Commune in Xiaoshan County harvested an average of 1,246 jin of seed cotton per mu on its 4.323 mu experimental cotton field.

The main reason for this year's bumper cotton harvest is primarily due to the resolute implementation of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the launch of the mass rectification campaign, the emancipation of the thinking of the vast cotton farmers, and the establishment of the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to act. This year's natural conditions were not favorable, but under the leadership of the Party, the vast cotton farmers exerted their full efforts to wage a tenacious struggle against disasters such as drought, typhoons, and rainstorms. In terms of yield-increasing technical measures, various places have carried out great innovations. The area where nutrient pot seedling transplantation was used accounts for 50% of the province. The main measures such as deep plowing, sufficient fertilization, and pest control have been greatly improved compared with previous years.

    银花怒放　白金遍野
    新疆浙江实现百斤皮棉指标
    总产量——新疆比去年增长81％，浙江比去年增长30.3％
    据新疆日报消息　新疆维吾尔自治区已一跃而为祖国的百斤皮棉自治区。连日以来，天山南北竞先发射出棉花的“火箭”“卫星”，涌现了二百斤皮棉县和许多英雄社、英雄场。这是自治区各族农民和农场职工为把自治区建成祖国高产植棉基地而作出的伟大贡献。
    据各地发来的丰收捷报，今年自治区实播的一百八十五万亩棉田平均亩产皮棉一百斤，比大丰收的1957年提高68.26％，总产量一百八十五万担，比去年增长81％。麦盖提县已跃升为自治区第一个二百斤皮棉县，该县六万九千亩棉田平均亩产皮棉二百斤，比去年翻了三番。鄯善、吐鲁番平均皮棉亩产都在一百三十斤以上。巴楚县今年在缺水、碱害严重的情况下，全县十万亩棉田亩产也达到一百一十八斤，比去年翻了三番。全区达到亩产一百斤以上的植棉地区共计十七个县市。各地还出现了大面积丰产田和高额丰产田，初步统计全区亩产皮棉二百斤至三百斤的有三十万亩；亩产三百斤至一千斤的“火箭田”有三万二千亩；亩产皮棉千斤以上的“卫星田”有二百亩以上，其中巴楚县就有一百一十五亩千斤亩。
    今年自治区棉花生产能够取得史无前例的辉煌成就，首先是由于全党全民思想大解放。去冬今春广大农村开展了全民整风，通过大鸣大放大辩论，批判了右倾保守思想，粉碎了落后论、条件论，激发了群众的革命干劲，从而促进了棉花生产的大跃进。这半年多来，全国和自治区在农业生产上不断出现的奇迹，大批元帅的升帐和卫星纷纷上天，又进一步解放了各族农民的思想，促使棉花生产指标一跃再跃，丰产措施叠叠追加。在解放思想的同时，各级领导一年来始终采取政治挂帅、走群众路线的工作方法，这也是决定棉花大丰收的重要关键。
    棉花生产大跃进的另一重要因素是贯彻了先进的、科学的增产措施。各地去冬以来，一般都抓紧了兴修水利、积肥造肥、推广良种、秋耕、整地、密植等基本措施。每亩棉田施肥多数在一万斤以上。并采用了良种，播种量一般为十四至十六斤。在栽培和田间管理方面，除了选种拌种，适时早播外，主要抓了保苗、保蕾、保铃等三个中心环节；抓紧了补苗、移苗、消灭三类苗、中耕、除草、合理灌溉、集中施底肥、分期分次追肥、根外追肥、看苗施肥、分株管理、治虫、整枝等等一系列的措施，特别是加强了后期田间管理工作。今年并积极推行了方形窝播和横向中耕、横向间苗、浸润灌溉、断根处理等措施，凡是采取了这些措施的都大大增了产。
    新华社杭州27日电　浙江省棉花空前大丰收。据本月23日统计：占全省棉田总面积90％左右的慈溪、萧山、余姚、平湖、上虞、镇海、海盐、海宁、杭州市等九个县
  （市）九十三万二千亩棉田，已采皮棉一百万担，超过大丰收1957年全省棉花总产量的30.3％，平均亩产量已达一○七点三斤，比去年增加39.3％。其中慈溪县皮棉亩产一一八点四斤，萧山县皮棉亩产一一八点三斤，上虞县皮棉亩产一○六点八斤。萧山县长江人民公社浦联生产队种的四点三二三亩试验棉田，平均每亩已收籽棉一千二百四十六斤。
    今年棉花获得大丰收的主要原因，首先是由于坚决贯彻了党的社会主义建设总路线，展开了全民整风，广大棉农解放了思想，树立了敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的共产主义风格。今年的自然条件并不是风调雨顺的，广大棉农在党的领导下，鼓足干劲与干旱、台风、暴雨等灾害作了顽强的斗争。在增产的技术措施上，各地进行了大革新，全省采用营养钵育苗移栽的面积占50％；深耕、施足肥料、除虫等主要措施都比往年大大提高。
