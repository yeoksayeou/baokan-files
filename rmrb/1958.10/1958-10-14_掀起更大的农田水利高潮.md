Unleash an Even Greater Upsurge in Farmland Water Conservancy

Today, this newspaper publishes a communique on the achievements of farmland water conservancy in 1958. This is a magnificent result achieved by our country's diligent and courageous 500 million farmers under the leadership of the Party, after a year of hard work. Expanding the irrigated area by 480 million mu in one year is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both at home and abroad. Our ancestors spent thousands of years of long years and hard work, and before liberation, the country had only 230 million mu of irrigated area. In the eight years after liberation, water conservancy construction developed rapidly, and the irrigated area was expanded by another 290 million mu; and the achievements of this year alone exceeded the thousands of years before liberation and the first eight years after liberation. In the past 20 years, the world has expanded its irrigated area by a total of more than 400 million mu, but our water conservancy construction achievements in one year have exceeded it. This unprecedented miracle can only be created by the 600 million people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on water conservancy work, made a scientific analysis and summary of water conservancy construction in 1958, and put forward the future direction and tasks, calling on the whole people to work hard for another two winters and two springs to basically realize the water conservancy of the country's existing cultivated land, so as to ensure greater leaps in agricultural production. This is a grand task, and this winter and next spring are the decisive moments to complete this task.

At present, our socialist construction is developing rapidly. Under this situation, isn't it a great opportunity to launch a farmland water conservancy movement with a larger scale and higher level than last winter and this spring, with more enthusiasm, greater strength, and more favorable conditions? We can recall that when the water conservancy upsurge began to appear last winter, people's views were not completely consistent. The promoters were of course the mainstream, riding the wind and waves and moving forward; while the regressives and the onlookers were discussing and doubting this and that. Now, only a year has passed, things have been done, achievements have been made, and all kinds of regressives, onlookers, skeptics, and conditionalists have to shut up. The promoters have gained an overwhelming advantage, the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has been greatly promoted, and the red flag of water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation is flying everywhere. Now it is no longer a question of whether or not to achieve water conservancy, but a question of competing with nature, winning the battle against water and drought disasters, and achieving water conservancy at high speed and high standards.

This year's food crops have already achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, cotton is releasing "satellites," and oil crops have also made remarkable achievements, but this is only the first round on the agricultural production front. According to the grand plan of doubling or even several times the grain, cotton, and oil crops next year, as one of the main measures for increasing agricultural production such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, farmland water conservancy construction is not enough, but still far from enough, and must be greatly strengthened. This is another compelling situation. This compulsion is very beneficial, and the people of the whole country welcome this compulsion, because it is one of the important and favorable conditions for promoting the accelerated development of water conservancy construction.

In the past few years, the tremendous development of farmland water conservancy construction has been carried out on the basis of agricultural cooperation. Now, there have been new changes, and the people's commune has been basically realized in the rural areas throughout the country. Agricultural cooperation is already far superior to individual agricultural economy, and the people's commune is even more superior to agricultural cooperatives. In the past, agricultural cooperatives could build smaller water conservancy projects of several hundred mu or several thousand mu, but now the people's commune can build larger water conservancy projects of tens of thousands of mu or hundreds of thousands of mu; in the past, agricultural cooperatives had the strength to resist smaller water and drought disasters, but now the people's commune has the strength to resist larger water and drought disasters; in the past, agricultural cooperatives focused water conservancy construction on drought prevention and flood control, but now the people's commune can comprehensively plan and carry out irrigation, flood control, power generation, navigation, aquaculture, as well as industrial, animal husbandry, water supply and other construction, comprehensive development, and fully utilize water resources. The higher the degree of agricultural collectivization and the larger the scale, the more urgent the demand for agricultural infrastructure, the wider the scope, and the stronger the strength. The upsurge of farmland water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will be launched on this new basis.

This year's achievements are unprecedentedly huge, and the current situation is also very favorable; but we must also see the problems existing in our work and the difficulties we may encounter in our progress.

The various water conservancy projects built last winter and this spring have played a significant role in resisting this year's drought and flood disasters and ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture; at the same time, these projects themselves have also undergone severe tests. In the past, the drought resistance capacity of irrigation projects in the south was generally 30 to 50 days, and the highest could reach 70 days, but this year there has been a large-scale long-term drought from south to north. Most areas in the south have been affected by drought for more than 100 days, and some areas in the north, such as Hebei, have not had a thorough rain for 300 days. This drought situation has seriously threatened the timely sowing and normal growth of crops. The standard for flood control generally requires that a single rainfall of 200 mm will not cause disaster, but this summer, in some areas, heavy rainfall was concentrated, with 300 to 400 mm of rainfall in about 20 days, and individual areas reached more than 500 mm. After the severe test of heavy rain and drought this year, one of the important experiences and lessons we should draw is that we must improve the drought resistance and flood control standards of various water conservancy projects according to different regions; on the premise of small-scale projects as the foundation, appropriately develop medium-sized projects and some necessary and possible large-scale projects, so that large, medium, and small projects are combined with each other, and a complete water conservancy project system is gradually built in a planned way. Starting from this experience and lesson, all localities should check and improve engineering standards, revise and supplement plans, lengthen short "vines" (canals), add more "melons" (ponds, reservoirs), and enlarge small "melons." If there are "vines" and "melons" but no "roots," then build larger backbone projects to let the long "vines" be rooted and expand the water source. In areas with river networks, those with networks but no outlines should establish outlines, and those with ports but no sluices should build sluices. In the northern well irrigation areas, if the shallow water is insufficient, drill machine wells and dig free-flowing springs to ensure the greatly increased irrigation water demand after increasing fertilizer application, deep plowing, and close planting. We must put forward high standard requirements like Jiangsu: "Ensure irrigation even if it doesn't rain for a year, no disaster even if it rains 500 (mm) a day, no danger from thousand-year floods, plant forest belts to prevent typhoons, make full use of water power, wind power, and water surface, and counties, cities, townships, and communities can be navigable."

In the water conservancy upsurge last winter and this spring, all localities have been making leaps forward, but compared between regions, development is still uneven. Some are leaping forward quickly with great achievements; some are leaping forward more slowly with smaller achievements; even in areas that have already achieved water conservancy, there are still blank spots, and various projects still need to be continuously consolidated and improved. The proportion of irrigated area to cultivated land area in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest and Southwest provinces except Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Guizhou is still low, and there is great potential for development. In the water conservancy upsurge this winter and next spring, there should be greater progress.

Our highest goal is to gradually transition from socialist society to communist society. From this perspective, our water conservancy construction is not only to solve drought and flood disasters, but also to further control the climate, transform nature, comprehensively develop, and maximize the utilization of water resources. Therefore, the meaning of high-standard water conservancy is not only to ensure irrigation water and eliminate flood disasters, but also to ensure the development of electricity, navigation, industrial water supply, and aquaculture, animal husbandry, and other undertakings. According to this requirement for water volume calculation, in areas north of the Yangtze River, where rainfall is less, we should try our best to gradually achieve the interception and storage of all runoff and explore groundwater sources. In areas south of the Yangtze River, where rainfall is abundant, ensuring irrigation water accounts for about 30%-50% of the total runoff, and most of the remaining water cannot be allowed to flow into the sea in vain. In addition to planned research on the South-to-North Water Diversion, all localities should also focus on storage as much as possible to intercept and store runoff, so that every cubic meter per second of flow and every meter of drop can serve socialist construction.

The amount of earthwork and stonework for farmland water conservancy this winter and next spring will be more than 120 billion cubic meters, more than double the 58 billion cubic meters completed last winter and this spring. At the same time, due to the greater leap forward in industry and agriculture, more labor is needed than last year. Under the condition of tighter labor, can such a huge engineering task be completed? The answer is yes. The key lies in adhering to putting politics in command and the secretary taking action; at the same time, we must vigorously engage in technological revolution and continuously improve labor organization. The situation of tight labor is a great thing in our opinion. On the one hand, it shows the all-round leap forward in our industrial and agricultural production, and on the other hand, it forces us to engage in technological revolution. Therefore, in this winter and next spring's water conservancy movement, all localities should, under the principle of unified arrangement and allocation of labor, grasp the two key points of tool reform and improving operating skills, and adapt to the changes of new tools and new technologies, improve labor organization, implement the method of large-scale corps operations with military organization, combat actions, and collective life, and continuously improve labor productivity. This is the only correct way. Some people believe that now that the Marshal of Steel and the Marshal of Machinery are about to ascend the throne, and there is a great shortage of labor for farmland water conservancy, it seems that we can only do less. This is not right. Although this situation is only very individual, it also shows that under the new situation, new right-leaning conservative ideas are emerging again. We say that the Marshal of Grain has already ascended the throne, and the Marshal of Steel and the Marshal of Machinery will also ascend the throne. The task of 10.07 million tons of steel this year must be fully committed and guaranteed to be completed, without any wavering. But this does not lead to the conclusion that the farmland water conservancy movement cannot be carried out on a large scale. Chairman Mao said: While vigorously engaging in steel, do not lose agriculture. One-sided thinkers are bound to fail to correctly implement the spirit of the Central Committee, thus causing losses in work. It should be pointed out that this right-leaning conservative ideology is a retreat to difficulty and an excuse to remain downstream. In carrying out the farmland water conservancy movement this winter and next spring, we must also continuously carry out a resolute struggle against various right-leaning conservative ideologies.

Our slogan is: Water conservancy must not give up an inch of land, seize time and compete for every second, hold high the red flag of the general line, and achieve a greater leap forward in the water conservancy upsurge this winter and next spring.

### 掀起更大的农田水利高潮

    掀起更大的农田水利高潮
    今天本报发表了1958年农田水利成就的公报。这是我国勤劳勇敢的五亿农民在党的领导下，奋战一年所取得的辉煌战果。一年扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，翻遍古今中外历史是找不到先例的。我们祖先经过几千年的漫长岁月和辛勤劳动，到解放前全国只有二亿三千万亩的灌溉面积；解放后八年，水利建设迅速发展，又扩大灌溉面积二亿九千万亩；而今年一年的成就，就超过解放前的几千年和解放后的前八年。近二十年间全世界扩大灌溉面积共四亿多亩，可是我们一年的水利建设成就就超过了它。这个亘古未有的奇迹，只有在中国共产党领导下的六亿人民才能创造。
    最近，中共中央发布了关于水利工作的指示，对1958年的水利建设作了科学的分析和总结，并且提出了今后的方针和任务，号召全民再苦战两冬两春，使全国现有耕地基本上实现水利化，从而保证农业生产获得更大跃进。这是一个宏伟的任务，而今冬明春则是完成这个任务的决战关头。
    现在，我国的社会主义建设事业，正在一日千里地发展着。在这个形势下，开展一个比去冬今春规模更大、水平更高的兴修农田水利运动，难道不是干劲更足，力量更大、条件更为有利的大好时机吗？我们可以回想一下，当去年冬季，水利高潮开始出现的时候，人们的看法并不是完全一致的，促进派当然是主流，他们乘风破浪，鼓楫前进；而促退派、观潮派，却在一旁议论纷纭，这也害怕，那也怀疑。现在，为时不过一年，事情干出来了，成绩摆出来了，各种各样的促退派、观潮派、怀疑论者、条件论者，都不能不哑口无言。促进派占了压倒的优势，敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义风格得到大大发扬，水利建设和水土保持的红旗到处飘扬。现在已经不是能不能水利化的问题，而是要与老天比高低，与水旱灾害决胜负，高速度、高标准地实现水利化的问题了。
    今年粮食作物已经获得了空前的丰收，棉花正在放出“卫星”，油料作物也取得了显著的成绩，但这还只是农业生产战线上的第一个回合。根据明年粮、棉、油料作物都要再翻一番到几番的宏伟计划，作为水、肥、土、种、密等各项农业增产主要措施之一的农田水利建设，不是已经够了，而是还很不够，还要大加努力。这又是一种逼人的形势。这一逼大有好处，全国人民欢迎这一逼，因为它是促进水利建设加速发展的重要的有利条件之一。
    过去几年来，农田水利建设的巨大发展，是在农业合作化的基础上进行的。现在，情况又有了新的变化，全国农村基本上实现了人民公社化。农业合作化比起个体农业经济来是已经优越得多了，而人民公社则比农业合作社更加优越。过去农业合作社能修几百亩、几千亩较小的水利工程，现在人民公社就能修几万亩、几十万亩较大的水利工程；过去农业合作社有力量抗御较小的水旱灾害，现在人民公社就有力量抗御更大的水旱灾害；过去农业合作社把水利建设的重点放在防旱治涝上，现在人民公社就有可能全面规划，进行灌溉、治涝、发电、航运、水产以及工业、畜牧、供水等建设，综合开发，充分利用水利资源。农业集体化的程度越高，规模越大，对农业基本建设的要求越迫切，范围越广，力量也越雄厚。今冬明春的农田水利建设高潮，将要在这个新的基础上开展起来。
    今年的成就是空前巨大的，当前的形势也是十分有利的；但是还看到我们工作中存在的问题和前进中可能遇到的困难。
    去冬今春所修的各项水利工程，在抗御今年旱涝灾害、保证农业大丰收上，已经发挥了显著的作用；同时这些工程本身也经受了严重的考验。过去南方灌溉工程的抗旱能力，一般是三十天到五十天，高的可以达到七十天，但今年从南到北都出现大面积的长期干旱，南方大部地区受旱在一百天以上，北方有些地区如河北等地三百天未下透雨。这种干旱情况曾严重地威胁着农作物的及时播种和正常生长。治涝标准一般要求达到一次降雨二百公厘不成灾，但今年夏季部分地区暴雨集中，二十天左右降雨三、四百公厘，个别地区达到五百公厘以上。经过今年暴雨和大旱的严重考验，我们应该得出的重要经验教训之一，就是必须根据不同地区，提高各项水利工程的抗旱和防涝标准；在以小型工程为基础的前提下，适当地发展中型工程和必要的可能的某些大型工程，使大、中、小工程相互结合，有计划地逐渐建成完整的水利工程系统。从这一经验教训出发，各地都应该检查和提高工程标准，修订和补充规划，藤（渠）短的加长，瓜（塘、库）少的加多，瓜小的加大，有藤有瓜而无根的，则修建较大的骨干工程，让长藤扎在根上，扩大水源；在河网化地区，有网无纲的要立纲，有港无闸的要建闸；在北方井灌区，浅层水不足的，打机井，挖自流泉，以保证增施肥料、深耕、密植后大大增加的灌溉需水量。要像江苏那样提出高标准的要求：“一年不雨保灌溉，日雨五百（公厘）不成灾，千年洪水不出险，普植林带防台风，水力、风力、水面多利用，县市乡社能通船。”
    在去冬今春水利高潮中，各地都在跃进，但地区之间比较起来，发展还是不平衡的，有的跃进快，成绩大；有的跃进较慢，成绩较小；就是在已经水利化的地区，也还有空白点，各项工程也还有待于继续巩固、提高。东北、内蒙古和除新疆、青海、贵州以外的西北、西南各省，灌溉面积占耕地面积的比例还较低，发展的潜力很大，在今冬明春的水利高潮中，应有更大的进展。
    我们的最高目标是由社会主义社会逐步过渡到共产主义社会。从这个角度来看我们的水利建设，就不仅是解决旱涝灾害问题，而是要进一步控制气候，改造自然，综合开发，最大限度地利用水利资源。所以高标准水利化的含义，不仅是保证灌溉用水，消除洪涝灾害，而且是保证电力、航运、工业供水和水产、畜牧等事业发展。按这样要求来计算水量，在长江以北地区，雨量较小，应尽可能地逐步作到拦蓄全部径流，并发掘地下水源；长江以南雨量丰沛，保证灌溉用水量约占总径流量30％—50％，其余大部分水量，也不能让它白白流入大海。除有计划地研究南水北调外，各地同样应该以蓄为主，尽量拦蓄径流，使每一秒公方的流量，每一公尺的落差，都来为社会主义建设服务。
    今冬明春农田水利土石方任务，将在一千二百亿公方以上，比去冬今春所完成的五百八十亿公方，超过一倍还多；同时，由于工农业的更大跃进，需要的劳力也比去年多的多。在劳力更加紧张的情况下，能不能完成这样巨大的工程任务呢？回答是肯定的。关键在于坚持政治挂帅，书记动手；同时要大闹技术革命，不断改善劳动组织。劳力紧张的情况，在我们看来是一件大好事，它一方面表明我们工农业生产的全面跃进，另一方面也逼得我们必须搞技术革命。因此，在今冬明春水利运动中，各地应在统一安排和调配劳力的原则下，抓紧工具改革和提高操作技术这两个关键，并适应新工具、新技术的变化，改善劳动组织，实行组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的大兵团作战方法，不断提高劳动生产率。这是唯一正确的办法。有些人认为现在钢铁元帅、机械元帅要升帐，兴修农田水利的劳力大感不足，好像只能少做些，这是不对的。这种情况虽然只是很个别的，但也说明在新的形势下，新的右倾保守思想又在露头。我们说粮食元帅已经升帐，钢铁元帅、机械元帅也都要升帐。今年一千零七十万吨钢的任务，必须全力以赴，保证完成，丝毫不能动摇。但是这并不能得出结论，说农田水利运动就不能大规模地开展了。毛主席说：在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉了。思想片面的人必然不能正确地贯彻中央的精神，因而造成工作上的损失。应该指出，这种右倾保守思想，是向困难低头的遁词，是甘居下游的借口。在开展今冬明春的农田水利运动中，还必须不断地与各种右倾保守思想，进行坚决的斗争。
    我们的口号是：水利化寸土不让，抢时间分秒必争，高举总路线的红旗，在今冬明春的水利高潮中，来一个更大的跃进。
