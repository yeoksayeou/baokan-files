Congratulations from Iraq
Abdullah Wahab Mahmoud, Head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China

Today, the People's Republic of China celebrates its ninth National Day. On this joyous occasion, we extend our congratulations to the great Chinese people and their heroic leaders.

We are extremely pleased to witness the great construction projects and all the work being carried out on China's beautiful land, which cannot be described by pen and ink. These construction projects and work are for the benefit of the Chinese people, and also for the benefit of all mankind, because as China becomes stronger and richer, mankind feels more and more secure about its future and has confidence in it.

Now China is undergoing a great leap forward in all aspects. The friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people, as well as the Arab people, has also made a great leap forward, and has made the ties of understanding, friendship and mutual cooperation between our people very close.

The Iraqi people and the Arab people have deeply understood from the experience of past struggles that in the current situation, in addition to their own conscience, heroism, and the unity of their patriotic leadership, they will always eagerly need the unity of peace-loving forces led by the Soviet Union and China. The support and assistance given by China and the Soviet Union to the Arab national liberation movement is invaluable. Czechoslovakia's sale of arms, the Soviet Union's warnings, and the Soviet Union's military exercises on the Turkish and Iranian borders, the demonstrations by millions of Chinese people, and China's early recognition of the Algerian government—these are all events of decisive significance in the history of the Asian and African national liberation movement. Therefore, we believe that the struggles in West Asia and Africa are the same struggle, and we are partners in this same struggle. This struggle may be two-sided or multi-faceted at a certain period, but it is always the struggle of the same whole. In many cases, imperialism creates tension or carries out aggression in a certain region in an attempt to divert people's attention from another front. This conspiracy of imperialism has been exposed and can no longer deceive anyone. Therefore, we believe that your struggle to liberate Taiwan and other Chinese islands is another aspect of our common struggle against imperialism. The Iraqi people and all Arab people support you, because your victory is our victory. Today, we congratulate you on your ninth National Day, and we also hope to share the joy of your victory in recovering Taiwan and other Chinese islands soon.

### 来自伊拉克的祝贺

    来自伊拉克的祝贺
    伊拉克人民友好访华代表团团长  阿卜杜拉·瓦哈布·马哈茂德
    今天，中华人民共和国庆祝她的第九周年国庆，际此欢乐的节日，我们谨向伟大的中国人民和他们英勇的领袖们表示祝贺。
    我们万分愉快地看到在中国美好的国土上进行的伟大的，非笔墨所能形容的建设事业和一切工作。这些建设事业和工作都是为了中国人民的福利，也是为了全人类的福利，因为中国越来越富强，人类就越来越感到自己未来的安全，并且对它具有信心。
    现在中国各方面都在大跃进。中国和伊拉克人民以及阿拉伯人民之间的友谊也已有了大跃进，而且使得我们人民之间的了解、友谊与互相合作的联系非常密切。
    伊拉克人民和阿拉伯人民在过去斗争的经验中深深理解到：在目前形势下，除了他们自己的良知、英雄主义，以及他们爱国主义的领导的团结外，他们永远热切需要以苏联、中国为首的爱好和平的力量的团结。中国和苏联对阿拉伯民族解放运动所给予的支援与帮助是不可估价的。捷克斯洛伐克的售予军火，苏联的警告以及苏联在土耳其、伊朗边境举行的军事演习、中国千百万人民的游行示威、中国最先承认阿尔及利亚政府——这些都是亚洲、非洲民族解放运动史上具有决定意义的事件。因此，我们相信西亚和非洲的斗争是同一的斗争，我们是在这同一斗争中的伙伴。这一斗争在一定时期可能是两方面或多方面的，但它永远是同一整体的斗争。在许多场合下，帝国主义在某一地区制造紧张或进行侵略，企图转移人们对另一战线上的注意力。帝国主义这一阴谋诡计已被揭露无遗，今后更欺骗不了任何人。因此，我们认为你们为解放台湾和中国其他岛屿的斗争，就是我们共同反对帝国主义斗争的另一面。伊拉克人民和所有阿拉伯人民支持你们，因为你们的胜利，就是我们的胜利。今天，我们祝贺你们的九周年国庆，同时也希望不久就将分享你们收复台湾和中国其他岛屿的胜利的欢乐。
