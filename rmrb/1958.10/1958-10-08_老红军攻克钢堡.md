    Old Red Army Captures Steel Fortress
    On the morning of July 28th, thirty-seven old Red Army veterans, supported by the state and living in Chengdu, smelted their first batch of qualified high-carbon steel using a crucible.
    These veterans, supported by the state, were mostly old Red Army soldiers who had participated in the Long March. They had fought countless battles for the people. Some were injured or disabled, some suffered from chronic illnesses or were too old and frail to work. Around 1955, they retired from the army and were supported by the state for the rest of their lives.
    In the upsurge of the whole Party and all the people running industry, the old heroes could not restrain their ambitions. They proposed to use the spirit of crossing the snow-capped mountains and grasslands to run industry with the whole people and support national construction. Then, they took out more than 3,000 yuan they had saved through diligence and thrift as capital to start a steel plant. None of them understood steelmaking technology, so they sent people to the Chengdu Tractor Factory to learn, and they learned and experimented at the same time. The first three attempts failed, but how could this discourage the old heroes? On the afternoon of July 27th, with the help of workers from Factory 402, the fourth attempt began. The trial started at 7 p.m. These frail but highly motivated old heroes were all busy throughout the night. Sixty-four-year-old Ye Ying and old Red Army soldier Lin Zhen, who was suffering from lung cancer, also stayed by the furnace, working tirelessly. At 3:40 a.m. the next morning, the steel furnace finally produced the first batch of high-carbon steel.

    老红军攻克钢堡
    7月28日上午，住在成都市的三十七个老红军供养干部，用坩锅炼出了第一炉合格的高炭钢。
    这些供养干部，多半是经过长征的老红军。他们为人民身经百战，有的受伤残废了，有的积劳成疾或是年老体衰失去了工作能力，1955年前后从部队退伍，由国家供养终身。
    在全党、全民办工业的高潮中，老英雄们也按捺不住各自的雄心，提出要拿过雪山草地的精神，和全民一起办工业，支援国家建设。接着，他们就拿出勤俭节约下来的三千多元钱作资金，搞起炼钢厂来。他们没人懂炼钢技术，就派人到成都市拖车厂去学习，并且边学习边试炼。开始三次都失败了，但是这怎么能使老英雄们灰心呢？7月27日下午，他们在四零二厂工人们的帮助下，第四次试炼又开始了。试炼从下午七点开始，这些身残体衰、斗志高昂的老英雄们，又个个忙了一个通宵。六十四岁的叶英和患着肺癌的老红军林真，也一直围在炉旁忙个不停。第二天早晨三点四十分，钢炉终于吐出了第一炉高炭钢的钢水。
