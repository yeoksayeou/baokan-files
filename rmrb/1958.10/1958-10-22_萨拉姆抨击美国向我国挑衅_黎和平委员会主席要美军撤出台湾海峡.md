Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 20th -- Lebanese National Front leader Salam, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua reporters today, commented on the tense situation in the Taiwan area caused by the United States' occupation of Chinese territory and military provocations against China. He said, "We abhor aggression wherever it occurs in the world, just as we abhor aggression here."

	The prominent political figure said, "I certainly believe that tensions anywhere in the world can easily draw the entire world into disputes." He believes that military intervention is also not in the interests of the United States.

	Salam also told reporters that he had refused an invitation from Chiang Kai-shek group elements -- the so-called "ambassador" to Lebanon -- to visit Taiwan. He told Xinhua reporters, "I would like to visit the real China in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 19th -- Chairman of the Lebanese Peace Committee, Antoine Tabet, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua reporters, said: "The Lebanese people understand the extreme seriousness of the provocations by American imperialism against the People's China, and demand that the U.S. Seventh Fleet withdraw from the Taiwan Strait."

	Tabet said: "The Lebanese people are threatened by the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the occupation of U.S. troops. From their own painful experiences, they understand the true face of American imperialists and their threat to all freedom-loving and peace-loving people and to world peace."

	The famous peace fighter and prominent Lebanese architect said that Lebanese nationalist newspapers have fully expressed the Lebanese people's great sympathy for the great Chinese people and have repeatedly and strongly condemned the American aggressors' attempts to prevent the Chinese people from liberating the coastal islands, Taiwan, and Penghu, and from restoring China's seat in the United Nations. Tabet pointed out that if American imperialism continues to provoke China, the Chinese people will teach the American aggressors a lesson. This would be a valuable help to the Lebanese people and a valuable contribution to the cause of world peace.

	He believes that the Lebanese people's uprising will be beneficial to Lebanon "pursuing a policy of peace, friendship, and peaceful coexistence with Arab countries, Bandung countries, and the socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union and People's China." He said, "The Soviet Union and People's China have never been unwilling to help us consolidate our independence and respect our sovereignty."

    萨拉姆抨击美国向我国挑衅
    黎和平委员会主席要美军撤出台湾海峡
    新华社贝鲁特20日电　黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖萨拉姆今天在单独接见新华社记者评论美国占领中国领土和对中国进行军事挑衅所造成的台湾地区紧张局势时说，“我们憎恶在世界任何地方发生的侵略，就像憎恶在这里发生的侵略一样。”
    这位著名的政界人士说：“我的确认为，世界上任何地方的紧张局势都很容易把全世界卷入纠纷”。他认为军事干涉也是不符合美国的利益的。
    萨拉姆还对记者说，他拒绝了蒋介石集团分子——所谓驻黎巴嫩“大使”——向他发出的访问台湾的邀请。他对新华社记者说：“我愿意在将来访问真正的中国。”
    新华社贝鲁特19日电　黎巴嫩和平委员会主席安托万·塔伯特在单独接见新华社记者时说：“黎巴嫩人民了解美帝国主义对人民中国的挑衅的极度严重性，并且要求美国第七舰队撤出台湾海峡。”
    塔伯特说：“黎巴嫩人民受到美国第六舰队的威胁和美国军队的占领，他们从他们自己的惨痛的经历中了解到美帝国主义者的真面貌，以及他们对一切爱好自由和和平的人们和对世界和平的威胁。”
    这位著名的和平战士和著名的黎巴嫩建筑家说，黎巴嫩民族主义报纸已经充分表达了黎巴嫩人民对伟大的中国人民的巨大同情，并且多次强烈谴责美国侵略者企图阻挠中国人民解放沿海岛屿、台湾和澎湖，不让恢复中国在联合国中的席位。塔伯特指出，如果美帝国主义继续对中国进行挑衅，中国人民将给予美国侵略者以教训，这是对黎巴嫩人民的宝贵的帮助，也是对世界和平事业宝贵的贡献。
    他认为，黎巴嫩人民的起义将有利于黎巴嫩“奉行和平、友好和同阿拉伯国家、万隆国家和社会主义阵营、特别是苏联和人民中国和平共处的政策”。他说，“苏联和人民中国从来不会不愿意帮助我们巩固我们的独立，并且尊重我们的主权。”
