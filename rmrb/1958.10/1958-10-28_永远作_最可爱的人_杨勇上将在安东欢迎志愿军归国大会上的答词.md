Always Be the "Most Beloved People"
Comrade Yang Yong's Reply at the AnDong Welcome Home Rally for the Chinese People's Volunteers

Dear Head of Delegation Liao Chengzhi and all comrades of the National People's Representative Delegation,
Dear compatriots of Liaoning Province and Andong City:

Today, all comrades of the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers, laden with honor and friendship, have returned to the embrace of the motherland. The moment we stepped onto the soil of our motherland, seeing the grand welcome line of our loved ones and hearing their warm voices, we felt indescribable warmth and joy. Please allow me, on behalf of all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to express our heartfelt gratitude for the grand welcome from our loved ones!

Seeing our loved ones, whom we have missed day and night for eight long years, and witnessing the magnificent panorama of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our motherland, our hearts are filled with the greatest joy and excitement in the world, and we deeply feel the unparalleled glory of being a Chinese son and daughter! Let us first greet our great motherland that has nurtured us, and greet our beloved Party and Chairman Mao who have guided us from victory to victory!

Comrades! During our eight years in Korea, we fought and lived together with the Korean people, and our blood solidified an unbreakable bond of combat friendship. When we left Korea, we were greeted with a grand and solemn farewell by the Party, government, army, and people of Korea. At the thousands of farewell gatherings with the Korean people, Korean old men, old women, brothers and sisters, with infinite reluctance and heartfelt farewells, repeatedly instructed us to bring back their friendship with the Chinese people and convey it to every countryman. Now, we convey the deep friendship of the Korean people to our loved ones, so that the flowers of Sino-Korean friendship will forever bloom and never fade between the people of our two countries, lasting for all time!

Looking back, the fact that the Volunteers were able to make even the smallest contribution in the eight-year War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, in the final analysis, came from the support and encouragement of the people of the motherland. When we first crossed the Yalu River and entered Korea to participate in the war, we were almost entirely reliant on machine guns, mortars, rifles, and hand grenades to confront the superior enemy. When we fought on Huangcaoling, on both sides of the Han River, eating frozen potatoes with snow, and crossing icy rivers in the harsh winter, who gave us endless strength? It was the motherland.

From the shores of Changjin Lake, Shangganling Ridge, all the way to the JinCheng front line, who encouraged the immortal Yang Gensi, Huang Jiguang, and thousands upon thousands of heroes to exchange their lives for victory and open the road to peace? It was the motherland. In the years after the armistice, on the 38th parallel, on the coasts and islands of Korea, who motivated the sentries and patrols of the Volunteers to guard this peaceful frontier day after day, year after year, regardless of the heat or cold, together with the Korean People's Army? It was the motherland. During the war years, the people of the motherland put forward the slogan: "Give the Volunteers whatever they need, and give them as much as they need." Workers launched production increase and savings competitions under the slogan "Machines are guns, factories are battlefields"; farmers "competed to hand in anti-American grain" under the slogan "Good grain to the military grain"; and young people actively responded to the call of the motherland, took up arms, and marched to the front lines. When we lacked airplanes, artillery, and other new-type weapons, the motherland immediately launched a nationwide weapon donation campaign, and in a short period of time, the Volunteers were equipped with airplanes, tanks, and rocket launchers. When we were living a hard life on the battlefield, the motherland immediately specially made and rushed to transport cod liver oil, egg powder, compressed dry rations, and various recreational supplies for the Volunteers. Every year, when the autumn wind had just risen and the yellow leaves had not yet fallen, the motherland would transport thick new winter clothes to the front; while the ice and snow had just begun to melt and the spring chill was still heavy, new summer clothes, better than the previous year, were sent across the Yalu River. The sewing kits, insecticide powder, and cordial letters of sympathy tucked inside the military uniforms, the visits of the comfort delegations to Korea time after time, the glorious title of "most beloved people," and the news of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in the motherland, brought so much maternal care, so many hopes and encouragement from our loved ones to the Volunteers! The Volunteers have thus intimately experienced the great significance of the motherland in the past eight years. The motherland is the source of our victory, and this sentence is deeply engraved in the hearts of every officer and soldier of the Volunteers. In the past eight years, the efforts made by the Volunteers for the motherland and the achievements they have made should first of all be attributed to the great people of the motherland, and to the Party and Chairman Mao!

Comrades, the achievements made by the Volunteers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea are also inseparable from the full support of the heroic Korean people, the joint struggle of the Korean People's Army, and the meticulous care of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government. For eight years, during the war, how many "Volunteer Army mothers" and tens of thousands of Korean elders, brothers, and sisters opened up ice cellars in the snow and bitter cold to wash our blood-stained clothes and mend our torn bedding, and transported grain and ammunition and repaired the roads of advance in the face of danger regardless of the rain of bullets. The great An Yu-ji, Park Jae-geun, and other unknown heroes gave their lives to protect and rescue Volunteer Army soldiers. In joint labor, the Korean people cleared out rooms and gave up warm floors, delivered water and cooked meals for us, truly as close as family, as intimate as flesh and blood. This year, when the Volunteers withdrew from Korea, the Korean people again launched a nationwide enthusiastic send-off, with nearly seven million people signing their names on a letter of thanks to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people. Premier Kim Il-sung and the leaders of the Republic came to see us off many times, earnestly encouraged us, and gave extremely high evaluations of the Volunteer Army's struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

For eight years, we in Korea have always lived in a great atmosphere of internationalist friendship. In particular, during the eight months since the troop withdrawals began in batches from February this year, we have been completely immersed in the ocean of internationalist friendship. The officers and soldiers of the Volunteers have personally felt the lofty and preciousness of this internationalist friendship over the past eight years, and deeply realized the enormous power generated by the strong unity of the socialist family. If the Volunteers' eight years in Korea had been without the heroic struggle of the Korean people and their full support for our army, then any achievement would have been unimaginable. Today, let us, in Andong City, which is adjacent to the Korean border, once again express our heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the heroic Korean people!

Comrades, what is especially exciting as we withdraw from Korea is that we have personally seen that under the leadership of the Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people are diligent, hardworking, and struggling arduously. On a pile of ruins, they have restored their homeland, which was seriously damaged by the war, with their own hands; they have built up the cities, villages, factories, and schools that were destroyed by the war. After only a short five years since the armistice, industrial and agricultural production has recovered and greatly exceeded the pre-war level. This thriving scene in the northern half of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stands in stark contrast to the economic bankruptcy of the southern half of Korea. While socialist construction in Korea is striding forward on the Chollima, the heroic Korean People's Army is guarding the ceasefire line with an increasingly strong posture, defending the eastern outpost of the socialist camp. Comrades, we are not only returning full of the internationalist friendship of the Korean people, but we are also bringing back the gratifying scene of the Korean people leaping forward to socialism on the Chollima, and the firm belief of the Korean people in adhering to the eastern outpost of peace. We are proud to have such a heroic neighbor for our motherland.

The eight years of the Volunteers in Korea is only a short moment in history, but great changes have taken place in these eight years. These eight years are eight years in which the East wind has increasingly prevailed over the West wind, and eight years of great development in the construction of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. In particular, our motherland, in these short eight years, has experienced such profound and great earth-shaking changes! The newest and most beautiful paintings drawn by the 650 million people on the land of the motherland under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao in the past year are so dear to the children who have been away from the motherland for a long time! Eight years ago, the motherland, which had just been liberated from the long-term dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries, was in a difficult situation with scars all over and awaiting revival in all aspects. Today, however, the motherland has stepped into a great era where one day equals twenty years. Industrial and agricultural construction is advancing rapidly, the technical revolution and the cultural revolution are galloping, and the socialist consciousness of the people of the motherland is so unprecedentedly high and politically. The high degree of unity in thought has given us a profound education. Comrades! In the face of this exciting scene, we cannot help but enthusiastically sing the praises of our beloved motherland. The Volunteer Army martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the motherland and for peace on the soil of Korea, their blood was not shed in vain, their wishes are being realized in the motherland today, and they can smile in the afterlife.

Comrades, the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea marks the unparalleled confidence of the people of China and Korea in resisting aggression and maintaining peace. The great victory of the people of China and Korea in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea disrupted the timetable for the U.S. imperialism's preparation for launching a new world war, defended and consolidated the democratic base of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, ensured the security of the industrial base in Northeast China, gained experience in fighting against the U.S. military, exposed the U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger that appeared strong but was weak, and inspired the struggle of the colonial and semi-colonial people for freedom and independence. The great victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea tells us: In the period from 1950 to 1953, the people of China and Korea had been liberated not long ago, and their economic and defense forces were still relatively weak, while the imperialist invading army possessed a great advantage in material strength and technical equipment. Under such conditions at that time, the Chinese and Korean People's Armies defeated the conceited U.S. military, giving it an unprecedented defeat in history, forcing the American generals who had once frantically clamored "Let the planes and artillery debate" to cease fire and admit defeat. Now, China and Korea are much stronger in economic and defense forces than they were eight years ago, and the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is even more united than ever before. Since the U.S. aggressors still had to end in their own defeat under conditions that were relatively favorable to the enemy in the past, then if they forget the lessons of the Korean War and still want to take risks again when today's conditions in all aspects are greatly unfavorable to them, an even more tragic defeat is waiting for them. Now, the Volunteers have voluntarily withdrawn from Korea entirely for the sake of peace, but the U.S. military still occupies the southern part of Korea and continues to adhere to its policy of military aggression in the Taiwan Strait region. We are here to give the war maniacs in the United States a solemn warning once again: Now is the time for you to learn from historical lessons and recognize the current task, and you should honestly withdraw your troops from southern Korea and from our Taiwan and Penghu as soon as possible! Otherwise, you will inevitably be subjected to the ruthless punishment of history.

Comrades! Now we have returned to the embrace of the motherland. We guarantee: Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there; whatever the motherland needs us to do, we will do. In the future cause of defending and building the socialist motherland, just as in performing the task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we will continue to contribute everything we have without reservation, and always maintain the glorious title of "most beloved people" given to us by the people of the motherland.

Dear comrades, when our Volunteer Army Headquarters and the last batch of troops return to the motherland, what we especially cannot forget is the people of Andong City who have a closer relationship with our Volunteer Army. All the comrades of our Volunteer Army deeply remember that in the eight-year struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the people of Andong City gave us great support for a long time. Since the troop withdrawal began this spring, all Volunteer Army units have passed through here, and they have been greeted by the grand and warm welcome of the people of Andong City. Here, let me, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, once again express our heartfelt thanks to the leading comrades of the Party and government organs of Liaoning Province, especially Andong City, and to the people's organizations and the people of the whole city.

Long live the great motherland!
Long live the militant friendship cemented in blood between the people of China and Korea!
Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

    永远作“最可爱的人”
    杨勇上将在安东欢迎志愿军归国大会上的答词亲爱的廖承志团长和祖国人民代表团全体同志亲爱的辽宁省和安东市同胞们：
    今天，中国人民志愿军总部全体同志，满载着荣誉和友谊，回到了祖国的怀抱。当我们一跨上祖国的土地，看到了亲人们隆重欢迎的行列，听到了亲人们热情的声音，我们就感到了说不出的温暖和欢欣。请让我代表中国人民志愿军全体同志，对亲人们的盛大欢迎，表示衷心的感谢！
    当我们见到了分别八年之久日夜想念的亲人，看到了祖国社会主义建设大跃进的宏伟图景，我们的心充满了人间最大的快乐、最大的兴奋，深深感到了作为一个中国儿女的无比光荣！让我们首先向抚育我们的伟大的祖国问好，向引导我们从胜利走向胜利的亲爱的党和毛主席问好！
    同志们！我们在朝鲜的八年时间中，和朝鲜人民一起战斗、一起生活，用鲜血凝成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。在我们离开朝鲜的时候，受到朝鲜的党、政、军、民规模巨大，庄严隆重的欢送。在与朝鲜人民千百次告别欢送会上，朝鲜的老大爷、老大娘和兄弟姊妹们，怀着无限留恋惜别的心情，一再嘱咐我们把他们对中国人民的友谊带回来，转达给每个祖国人民。现在，我们把朝鲜人民的深情厚谊转达给亲人们，让中朝友谊的鲜花在中朝两国人民之间永开不谢，万古流芳！
    回想起来，志愿军能够在八年抗美援朝的斗争中作出任何一个微小的贡献，归根结底，无一不是来自祖国人民的支援和鼓舞。当我们刚刚跨过鸭绿江入朝参战的初期，几乎只是凭着机关枪、迫击炮、步枪和手榴弹去迎击优势的敌人，我们战斗在黄草岭上、汉江两岸，冰雪拌炒面，严冬涉冰河的时候，是谁给了我们无穷的力量？是祖国。
    从长津湖畔、上甘岭上，直至金城前线，是谁鼓舞了不朽的杨根思、黄继光以及成千上万的英雄们，以自己的生命去换取胜利，去打开了和平的道路？是祖国。在停战后的岁月中，在三八线上，在朝鲜的海岸和岛屿上，是谁激励着志愿军的哨兵和巡逻兵，不分酷暑严寒，五年如一日地和朝鲜人民军一起警卫着这和平的前哨？是祖国。在战争的年月里，祖国人民提出行动口号：“志愿军要什么给什么，要多少给多少”。工人们在“机器即枪炮，工厂即战场”的口号下展开增产节约竞赛；农民们在“好粮送军粮”的口号下“争缴抗美粮”；青年们积极响应祖国召唤，拿起武器走向前方。当我们缺少飞机大炮及其它新式武器的时候、祖国就立即展开了全国规模的武器捐献运动，在短短的时间里，就使志愿军装备起了飞机、坦克和火箭炮。当我们过着战地艰苦生活的时候、祖国就立即为志愿军特制和赶运了鱼肝油、蛋粉、压缩干粮和各种文娱用品。每年，还在秋风刚起、黄叶未落的时候，祖国就把厚厚的新冬衣运到前方；还在冰雪初融、春寒犹重的时候，一年胜过一年的新夏装就送过了鸭绿江。那夹在军衣里的针线包、杀虫粉和亲切的慰问信，那一次一次的赴朝慰问团，那“最可爱的人”的光荣称号，那祖国社会主义建设大跃进的消息，给志愿军带来了多少慈母般的关怀，带来了多少亲人的期望和鼓舞！志愿军在以往八年中，就是如此亲切的体会了祖国的伟大意义。祖国，就是我们胜利的源泉，这句话深深地刻印在每个志愿军官兵的心里。八年来，志愿军为祖国所做的努力，所取得的成就，首先应当归功于伟大的祖国人民，归功于党和毛主席！
    同志们，志愿军在抗美援朝斗争中所取得的成就，又是和英雄的朝鲜人民全力支援、朝鲜人民军的并肩奋斗、朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的无微不至的关怀分不开的。八年来，在战争时期，有多少“志愿军妈妈”和成千上万的朝鲜父老兄弟姊妹们，在风雪严寒里打开冰窖为我们洗涤血衣和缝补破了的被服，在枪林弹雨中不怕危险为我们运送粮弹和抢修前进的道路。伟大的安玉姬、朴在根以及其他不知名的英雄，为了掩护和抢救志愿军战士而献出了自己的生命。在共同劳动中，朝鲜人民为我们腾房让炕，送水做饭，真是亲如一家，情同骨肉。今年，当志愿军撤出朝鲜时，朝鲜人民又掀起了全民的热情欢送，近七百万人在给中国人民志愿军和中国人民的感谢信上签下了自己的名字。金日成首相和共和国的领导人多次亲来送行，恳切勉励，给予志愿军抗美援朝斗争以极高的评价。
    八年来，我们在朝鲜始终生活在伟大的国际主义友情之中。特别是，从今年2月起分批撤军的八个月里，我们完全沉浸在国际主义友谊的海洋里。志愿军官兵八年来亲身感受到这种国际主义友情的崇高和珍贵，深深体会到，社会主义大家庭坚强团结所产生的巨大力量。志愿军在朝鲜的八年，如果离开了朝鲜人民的英勇斗争和对我军的全力支援，那么，任何成就都是难以想像的。今天，让我们在与朝鲜国境毗连的安东市，再次的向英雄的朝鲜人民致以衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意！
    同志们，在我们撤离朝鲜的时候，尤其令人兴奋的是，我们亲眼看到了，英雄的朝鲜人民在劳动党和金日成首相的领导下，勤劳奋发，艰苦奋斗，在一片废墟上，用自己的双手，把遭受战争严重破坏了的家园恢复起来了；把被战争破坏了的城市、乡村、工厂与学校建设起来了，仅仅经过停战后短短五年时间，工农业生产就恢复并大大超过了战前的水平。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北半部这种欣欣向荣的景象，正好与朝鲜南半部的经济破产形成鲜明的对照。在朝鲜社会主义建设跨上千里马向前奔驰的同时，英雄的朝鲜人民军，正在以日益坚强的姿态，守卫在停战线上，捍卫着社会主义阵营的东方前哨。同志们，我们不仅是满载朝鲜人民国际主义友谊而归，我们也带来了朝鲜人民跨上千里马向社会主义飞跃前进的可喜景象，带来了朝鲜人民坚守东方和平前哨的坚强信念。我们为祖国有这样一个英雄的邻邦感到骄傲。
    志愿军在朝鲜的八年，在历史上不过是一个短暂的时刻，但是这八年却发生了巨大的变化。这八年，是东风日益压倒西风的八年，是以苏联为首的社会主义各国建设大发展的八年。特别是我们的祖国，在这短短的八年内，经历了多么深刻多么伟大的翻天复地的变化啊！六亿五千万人民在党中央和毛主席领导下，近一年来在祖国大地上画出来的最新最美的画图，对久别祖国的儿女是多么亲切！八年以前，刚从帝国主义和反动派长期黑暗统治下解放出来的祖国，正处在满目创伤、百废待举的艰难日子里，而今天，祖国却已跨进了一天等于二十年的伟大时代。工农业建设一日千里，技术革命和文化革命万马奔腾，祖国人民的社会主义觉悟这样空前的高涨，在政治上。思想上这样高度团结一致，更使我们受到深刻的教育。同志们！面对这令人兴奋的景象，我们情不自禁地热情歌颂我们可爱的祖国。为了祖国，为了和平而献出了生命牺牲在朝鲜国土上的志愿军烈士们，他们的鲜血没有白流，他们的愿望今天正在祖国实现，他们可以含笑于九泉之下了。
    同志们，中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，这标志着中朝两国人民对反抗侵略、维护和平的无比信心。中朝两国人民抗美援朝的伟大胜利，打乱了美帝国主义准备发动新的世界大战的时间表，保卫并巩固了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的民主基地，保障了我国工业基地东北的安全，取得了同美国军队作战的经验，戳穿了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎，鼓舞了殖民地和半殖民地人民的争取自由独立的斗争。抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利的事实告诉我们：在1950年至1953年期间，中朝两国人民都是先后获得解放不久，经济力量和国防力量都还比较薄弱，而帝国主义侵略军队则拥有在物质力量和技术装备上的巨大优势，在当时那样的条件下，中朝人民军队就打败了自命不凡的美国军队，给予它在历史上从未有过的惨败，使曾经疯狂叫嚣“让飞机大炮去辩论”的美国将军们，不得不停战认输。现在，中朝两国在经济力量、国防力量上已经比八年前强大得多了，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营更是空前的团结。既然在过去那对敌人较为有利的条件下，美国侵略者仍然不得不以自己的失败而告终，那么，当今天各方面条件已大大对它不利的时候，如果它忘掉朝鲜战争失败的教训，还想再度冒险的话，更惨重的失败正在等待着他们。现在，志愿军为了和平已经主动全部撤出了朝鲜，但是美国军队至今仍然盘踞着朝鲜南部，并且还继续坚持对台湾海峡地区的军事侵略政策。我们在这里再次给美国的战争狂人们以郑重警告：现在是你们吸取历史教训，认识当前任务的时候了，应该老老实实把你们的军队从朝鲜南部，从我国的台湾、澎湖早日撤出去！否则，必将受到历史的无情惩罚。
    同志们！现在我们已经回到祖国的怀抱了。我们保证：祖国需要我们到那里去，我们就到那里去，祖国需要我们做什么，我们就去做什么。在今后保卫和建设祖国社会主义的事业中，像执行抗美援朝任务一样，继续毫无保留地贡献出自己的一切，永远保持祖国人民赠给我们“最可爱的人”的光荣称号。
    亲爱的同志们，当我们志愿军总部和最后一批部队返回祖国的时候，特别不能忘记的是和我们志愿军有着更加亲密关系的安东市人民。我们志愿军全体同志都深深地记得，在八年抗美援朝的斗争中，安东市人民长期给予了我们大力的支援。今春开始撤军以来，志愿军部队全部在这里通过，又受到了安东市人民的盛大热情的欢迎。在这里，让我代表志愿军全体指战员，向辽宁省特别是安东市的党政机关领导同志和各人民团体、全市人民，再次表示衷心的感谢。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中朝两国人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！
                                （新华社）
