Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th. Following the successful flight of an aircraft manufactured by the Beijing Aviation Institute, "Shenhang No. 1," China's second school-manufactured aircraft, soared into the skies above Shenyang on the 7th.

With the exception of the engine and instruments, the fuselage, control system, and landing gear of this aircraft were all manufactured by the teachers and students of the Shenyang Aviation Industry School. They were also responsible for the entire assembly of the aircraft. They completed the manufacture of this aircraft after sixty-five days and nights of hard work. This aircraft can be used for spraying pesticides, artificial rainmaking, rescue, and communication liaison. In addition to the pilot, it can carry three passengers, has a maximum range of 470 kilometers, can fly up to 4,000 meters, and has a speed of 70 to 170 kilometers per hour. It can take off and land on grassy fields of just over 200 meters.

On the afternoon of the 7th, Shenyang City held a ceremony for the test flight of this aircraft. After a fifteen-minute test flight, the aircraft performed normally and its performance was excellent.

The Shenyang Aviation Industry School is merely a secondary vocational school. The fact that it can manufacture aircraft is something that previous generations would not have dared to imagine. However, under the leadership of the school's Party general branch, the teachers and students broke down superstitions and promoted the communist style of daring to think and daring to act, overcoming all difficulties in the manufacturing process. During the design phase, there was no information available on civilian aircraft, only two instruction manuals related to aircraft maintenance and repair. The teachers and students visited various places to collect information and worked hard for a month to design the construction drawings. Lacking specialized machine tools for manufacturing aircraft, they used indigenous methods to make simple tools to replace them. Where parts needed to be bent, they used pliers and manual hammering. They also received strong assistance from units such as the Shenyang Foundry and the Shenyang Glider Factory. Through this aircraft manufacturing experience, the school's education was integrated with practical production. The teachers and students unanimously believe: "Two months of hard work are better than ten years of study." They learned a lot of practical knowledge and production skills. Students generally reached the level of second or third grade technicians, and their ideological awareness was also greatly improved.

### “沈航一号”上了天  沈阳航空工业学校试制飞机成功

    “沈航一号”上了天
    沈阳航空工业学校试制飞机成功
    新华社沈阳9日电　继北京航空学院制造的飞机上天之后，7日在沈阳上空飞翔起我国第二架学校制造的飞机“沈航一号”。
    这架飞机除发动机和仪表以外，机身、操纵系统和起落架都是沈阳航空工业学校的师生制造的。整个飞机的装配工作也是由他们担任的。他们经过六十五昼夜苦战才完成了这架飞机的制造。这架飞机可用于撒农药、人工造雨、救护和通信联络等，机内除驾驶员外，还能乘坐三人，最大航程是四百七十公里，最高可飞达四千公尺，时速七十到一百七十公里，在二百多公尺的草地上便能起飞和降落。
    7日下午，沈阳市举行了这架飞机试飞的典礼。飞机经过十五分钟试飞，飞行正常，性能很好。
    沈阳航空工业学校只不过是一所中等专业学校，能够制造出飞机来，是前人不敢想像的事。但是，在学校党总支的领导下，师生们破除迷信，发扬了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，在制造过程中突破了一切困难。设计时没有民用飞机的资料，只有两份有关飞机维护修理的说明书，教师和学生便到四处参观访问搜集资料，苦干一月，才把施工图纸设计出来。没有制造飞机的特殊机床，他们便采用土办法自制简单工具来代替。部件需要弯曲的地方，就用老虎钳子扳，用手工打。他们还得到了沈阳铸造厂、沈阳滑翔机制造厂等单位的大力协助。经过这次制造飞机，学校的教育与生产实际结合起来了。师生们一致认为：“苦干两个月，胜读十年书。”他们学到了很多实际知识和生产技能，学生一般都达到二、三级技工水平，而且思想觉悟也大大提高了。
