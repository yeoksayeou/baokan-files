    Rural Financial and Trade Work as Seen From the Satellite Commune
    By our reporter Fang Huang

    What changes have occurred in rural financial and trade work since the realization of people's communes in the vast countryside? Some clues can be seen from the Satellite People's Commune in Suiping County, Henan Province.

    The time since the establishment of the Satellite People's Commune and the decentralization of rural financial and trade work in Henan Province to be managed by the commune is still short. However, many new changes have appeared in the market and commercial operations, and new problems and new tasks have been put forward for financial and trade work.

    I. With the implementation of the wage system and the supply system, the original seasonal patterns of rural markets will lose their regularity. In addition to implementing a grain supply system, the Satellite Commune plans to supply each person with 500 catties of grain per year. In terms of wages, each laborer can receive a maximum of 7.61 yuan per month, a minimum of 2.03 yuan, and generally 3 to 5 yuan. Calculated annually, each person can receive an average basic wage of 43.32 yuan per year. With bonuses, each person can receive an average of 54.36 yuan per year, an increase of 64.73% over last year. Wages will be paid monthly, which is different from the previous method of two pre-distributions and one final settlement per year. Therefore, purchasing power entering the market will no longer be concentrated but released on a monthly basis, and the sale of means of subsistence will change from seasonal to year-round. The proportion of relatively high-end commodities in the sales of means of subsistence has increased. On September 1st, the commune paid out 81,553.49 yuan in wages for the first time. Within a few days, the market turnover (mainly means of subsistence) surged, especially the sales of high-end fabrics, such as serge and melton cloth costing 40 to 50 cents a foot, were the largest, while printed calico costing a little over 30 cents was not selling well. The role of rural market towns has also been greatly weakened. In the past, there was a market fair every three days in the three major villages of Tushan, Yangdian, and Huaimiao. Now, there are very few people going to the market on market days, and only more than usual in the evening. In addition, another new situation in the supply of means of subsistence is that there are fewer and fewer household utensils, and a large increase in collective living utensils and personal consumer goods for the community teams. For example, small pots, small basins, and small ladles are now overstocked and cannot be sold, while large pots and large vats are out of stock.

    II. In terms of the supply of means of production, due to the development of industry and handicrafts in the commune, most small farm tools are no longer circulated through commercial channels but are directly distributed within the commune. Therefore, in recent months, the supply of small farm tools has been greatly reduced. According to statistics, from January to April before the establishment of the commune, more than 10,000 small farm tools were supplied, while from May to August after the establishment of the commune, only 9,781 were supplied. During the same period, the commune produced and used 14,154 small farm tools. The number of large farm tools and various mechanical equipment required by the commercial departments has greatly increased. After the establishment of the commune, 140 steam and horse carts, 91 waterwheels, 1 power machine, and 12 double-furrow plows have been purchased. In the fall, there is still a demand for 300 steam and horse carts, 20 automobiles, 100 gas generators, 212 horse-drawn harvesters, 60 tractors, and other mechanical equipment.

    III. In terms of agricultural product procurement, due to the collectivization of private plots and the reduction of sideline production of commune members' families, scattered purchases will gradually decrease and will be transferred to the commune for centralized sales, which will reduce many links in the agricultural product procurement work.

    IV. There have also been great changes in grain work. First of all, the commune has implemented a grain supply system. The state only purchases grain in rural areas and does not sell grain. Grain storage will be completely decentralized to the commune. The state only pays storage fees, but the grain of the state and the commune must be stored separately. All the property of the original grain management office, except for transportation tools that are still used uniformly by the state, will be handed over to the commune. In addition to completing the state's grain purchase tasks and doing a good job in storage, the commune's grain storage organization must also be responsible for the commune's own grain storage, processing, and adjustment work. The task is not reduced but increased.

    V. After the wages were distributed, bank savings surged. On September 1st, the first distribution of wages was 81,553.49 yuan, and the amount of savings reached 68,300 yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the total wages. Before the wages were distributed, only more than 30% of the community had savings accounts. Now, 95.3% of the community members have become savings account holders. With the monthly distribution of wages, it is estimated that bank savings will continue to increase.

    VI. After the establishment of the commune, due to changes in some commodity circulation links, tax revenue has been greatly reduced. By the end of August, only 47% of the tax revenue task had been completed. The biggest reduction was in livestock transaction tax, followed by slaughter tax and business tax. In order to solve a series of new problems in tax revenue and not reduce national fiscal revenue, the Satellite Commune adopted a tax-guaranteed system. This year, the total tax guaranteed by the commune is 500,000 yuan. In addition to the amount already completed from January to August, there is still 220,000 yuan from September to December, including agricultural tax, agricultural tax surcharge, local tax surcharge, industrial and commercial tax, industrial profits, commercial profits, etc. After the tax-guaranteed task is set, the commune will keep any excess, and the commune will compensate for any shortfall, except in disaster years.

    VII. After the decentralization of the financial and trade system, all original employees were also placed under the management of the commune and became commune members, eating, living, and working with the commune members. In terms of wages and benefits, the commune will also be responsible, and the grades will be uniformly assessed with the general commune members. Now that the system has changed, 40% of the financial and trade cadres actively support it and are overjoyed at the establishment of the commune. However, 45% of the employees have concerns, mainly fearing a reduction in wages, and a few people have ideological resistance and are unwilling to join the commune.

    从卫星公社看农村财贸工作
    本报记者　方徨
    广大农村实现人民公社化以后，农村财贸工作发生了些什么变化？从河南省遂平县嵖岈山卫星人民公社可以看出一些端倪。
    卫星人民公社成立和河南省农村财贸工作下放归公社管理的时间还很短，但是，市场上和商业业务工作上都出现了许多新的变化，并且给财贸工作提出了新问题，新任务。
    一、随着工资制和供给制的实行，农村市场的淡旺季将失去原来的规律。卫星社除了实行粮食供给制，计划全年供给每人口粮五百斤以外，在工资上，每个劳动力最高每月可得七点六一元，最少可得二点零三元，一般为三至五元。如以年计算，每人每年平均可得基本工资四十三点三二元，加上奖励部分，每人全年平均可得五十四点三六元，比去年增长64.73％。工资将按月发放，与过去一年二次预分一次决算的办法不同，因此，购买力投入市场也将不再是集中投放而是按月投放，生活资料由季节性销售变为常年性销售。销售的生活资料中，比较高级的商品比重增加了。公社在9月1日第一次发放了工资八万一千五百五十三点四九元，几天内市场营业额（主要是生活资料）激增，特别是高档布匹，如四、五角钱一尺的哔叽、线呢销售量最大，三角多钱的花洋布不行销了。农村集散市场的作用也大大削弱了，过去每三天内，土山、杨店、槐庙三个主要村镇都有一次集会，现在逢集时上街的人很少，晚间，才比往常多起来。此外，生活资料供应中的另一个新情况是属于家庭用具越来越少，属于社队集体生活用具和个人消费品大大增加，如小锅、小盆、小瓢现在都积压卖不出去，而大锅大缸都脱销。
    二、在生产资料供应上，由于公社发展了工业和手工业，大部分小件农具不再通过商业流转环节，而由公社内部直接分配。因而最近几个月来，小件农具供应量大大减少，据统计，在公社建立以前的1至4月份，小农具供应了一万多件，而在公社成立后的5至8月份只供应了九千七百八十一件，同时期公社自产自用的小件农具却达一万四千一百五十四件。要求商业部门供应大件农具和各种机械设备的数量却大大增加。成立公社后，已购置的汽马车就有一百四十部，水车九十一部，动力机器一部，双铧犁十二部，秋后还要求供应汽马车三百辆、汽车二十部，煤气机一百部，马拉收割机二百一十二部，拖拉机六十台以及其他机械设备。
    三、在农产品采购方面，由于自留地归公和社员家庭副业生产减少，零散的收购将逐渐减少，都将转为由公社集中交售，农产品采购工作中就减少了不少环节。
    四、粮食工作方面也有很大的变化。首先是公社实行了粮食供给制，国家在农村只购粮食不销粮食，粮食保管将全部下放到公社，国家只付保管费用，但是国家和公社的粮食要分开保管，原有粮食管理所的全部财产，除调运工具仍由国家统一使用外，其余全部交公社。公社的粮食保管机构，除了完成国家粮食征购任务和做好保管工作以外，还要负责做好公社本身的粮食保管、加工、调剂工作，任务不是减轻而是加重了。
    五、发放工资后，银行储蓄激增。9月1日第一次发放工资八万一千五百五十三点四九元，储蓄数就达六万八千三百元，占工资总数80％以上。未发工资前，全社储蓄户只达30％多，现在全公社有95.3％的社员成了储蓄户，随着按月发放工资，估计银行储蓄仍将不断增加。
    六、成立公社后，由于部分商品流转环节的改变，税收减少很多。到8月底止，税收任务只完成47％。减少最多的，首先是牲口交易税，其次是屠宰税和营业税，为了解决税收上出现的一系列新的问题，不减少国家财政收入，卫星公社采取包税的办法，今年全社包税是五十万元，除1至8月份已完成的外，9至12月还有二十二万元，其中包括农业税、农业税附加、地方税附加、工商税、工业利润、商业利润等等，包税任务定下来以后，多了是公社的，少了公社赔偿，灾年例外。
    七、财贸体制下放以后，原有职工也全部划归公社管理，成为公社社员，和社员同吃同住同劳动，在工资待遇上，也将改为由公社负担，和一般社员统一评定等级。现在体制改变，财贸干部中40％的人是积极拥护的，对成立公社兴高彩烈。但有45％的职工有顾虑，主要是怕降低工资，少数人思想有抵触，不愿入公社。
