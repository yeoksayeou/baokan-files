Everyone Refines Steel (Crosstalk)
    河北安国中学 (Hebei Anguo Middle School)
    甲 (Jia): I'd like to ask you to write a couplet for my door.
    乙 (Yi): You mean the kind you stick on the front door?
    甲: Fresh! If you don't stick a couplet on the door, where else would you put it, on the kang table?
    乙: Alright, listen to the first line, "Loyalty and kindness passed down through generations."
    甲: (Quickly replies) "Poetry and books inherited for ages."
    乙: Hey, you can respond?
    甲: This is old hat. Give me something new.
    乙: New ones need a topic.
    甲: Good. Give me one based on the current international situation.
    乙: First line: "The east wind fiercely blows, suppressing the west wind."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "China's leap forward surpasses England."
    甲: The horizontal inscription is—
    乙: "The situation greatly changes."
    甲: If we want to surpass England, we must start with steel. How about you create a couplet with steel as the theme?
    乙: Steel as the theme? Alright!
    甲: First line?
    乙: "The human body needs to eat to develop."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Industry must have steel to grow."
    甲: Good, horizontal inscription?
    乙: "The entire people mobilize."
    甲: Good, since the entire people are mobilized, have you participated yourself?
    乙: How could I just talk without acting? A few days ago, I followed our commune's team to the mountains to refine steel.
    Everyone was filled with the spirit to swallow the sun and the moon, their energy soared to the sky, and they overfulfilled the task by three times. I'll use a few scenes to create a few Spring Festival couplets.
    甲: Give us one for the whole steel refining scene.
    乙: Listen. First line, "During the day, people and horses fill the mountains."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "At night, the earthen furnaces illuminate the sky."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Truly lively."
    甲: Did I ask you to just watch the excitement?
    乙: Listen again. First line, "Molten steel flows, iron flowers dance."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "People shout with joy, horses neigh loudly."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Cows bellow too."
    甲: How did that happen?
    乙: Because when the blast furnace produced iron, people and horses cheered and jumped for joy, and even the cows "moo—moo—"ed.
    甲: Steel refining cannot be done without ore. Give us one for mining the ore.
    乙: First line, "General Hammer chisels blasting holes."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Marshal Explosion opens up the mountains."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Clang—Boom!"
    甲: What's this mess?
    乙: "Clang" is the sound of chiseling the blasting hole. After chiseling the blasting hole, put in the explosives, light them, and with a "boom," the mountain opens up.
    甲: The comrades who transport the ore and coal are truly energetic, pulling small carts and running, traveling more than two hundred li a day. Give us one for them.
    乙: "Transporting ore, climbing mountain slopes, running like arrows."
    甲: The second line?
    乙: "Pulling coal, crossing deep valleys, walking like flying."
    甲: The horizontal inscription is—
    乙: "Plant more peanuts."
    甲: Do you have to plant peanuts while transporting ore?
    乙: It means "add more fuel." Peanuts can be pressed for oil.
    甲: Oh. Give us a couplet for the comrades building earthen furnaces.
    乙: First line, "Hundreds of earthen furnaces built at night."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Thousands of tons of steel produced at sunrise."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Still need to add fire."
    甲: The comrades splitting firewood for fuel are full of energy, eating one meal a day without feeling hungry or tired. Their axes and saws don't stop all day, they are truly extremely hardworking. Write a couplet for them.
    乙: Listen to the first line, "Axe goes up and down with full strength."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Saw goes back and forth with endless power."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Split it and burn it."
    甲: The comrades watching the fire fight day and night. Some comrades only slept for an hour in three days. Give us a couplet.
    乙: "Heroes compete by the steel refining furnace."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Heroes achieve meritorious deeds by the blower."
    甲: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Be careful not to get burned."
    甲: What?
    乙: Safe production, of course.
    甲: Thanks to the comrades' day and night battles, they broke through the daily production of a thousand tons. Write another one.
    乙: "Fighting day and night, a thousand tons of steel produced daily."
    甲: Second line?
    乙: "Seizing every second, ten thousand catties of grain produced per mu."
    甲: How did you get to grain again?
    乙: Chairman Mao instructed us not to abandon agriculture while refining steel.
    甲: Oh, horizontal inscription?
    乙: "A head-on blow."
    甲: How so?
    乙: American imperialism is invading our Taiwan. We will use practical actions to support our army's liberation of Taiwan. In addition to arming the entire people, we must also refine more steel and produce more grain to severely strike the American wolves!
    甲: Listening to you create couplets is—
    乙: Not bad.
    甲: Not that good.
    乙: Not that good? You make one.
    甲: Listen to the first line, "Right now, the two of us are performing crosstalk."
    乙: Second line?
    乙: "In a while, we'll each walk home."
    乙: Horizontal inscription?
    乙: "Eat quickly."
    甲: Why?
    乙: Quickly pack up your hoe and turn over the soil in the fields. Performing crosstalk is just a side job.
    乙: Right! Let's go.
