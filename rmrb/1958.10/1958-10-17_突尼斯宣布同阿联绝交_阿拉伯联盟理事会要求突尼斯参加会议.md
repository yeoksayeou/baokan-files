Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 16th: According to Cairo Radio, the Tunisian government announced on the 15th that it was severing diplomatic relations with the United Arab Republic.

The government of the United Arab Republic announced that it had requested Iraq's representative in Tunisia to look after the interests of the UAR in Tunisia.

Tunisia's move was taken after its representative recently attacked the UAR at a meeting of the Arab League Council. According to Cairo Radio, Arab sources commenting on the move said that it was not surprising that Tunisia severed diplomatic relations with the UAR in order to complete "the conspiracy plotted by imperialism and executed by Tunisia."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 16th: The Arab League Council passed a proposal by the Sudanese representative on the 15th. The proposal stated that the Council should notify the Tunisian government of its opinion regarding the Tunisian representative's attack on the United Arab Republic at the meeting, and request Tunisia to attend the League meeting.

The proposal was passed after the chairman of the meeting, Saudi Arabia's chief representative, Faqi, clarified his opinion. Faqi said that he agreed with the proposal, but that the proposal should include the meaning that the Council's resolution on the 13th condemning Tunisia's actions was correct. He said that if the Tunisian representative agreed to attend the meeting, it should mean that it agreed to the Council's resolution and would no longer raise the issue.

The representatives of the United Arab Republic and Yemen abstained from voting.

    突尼斯宣布同阿联绝交
    阿拉伯联盟理事会要求突尼斯参加会议
    新华社开罗16日电　据开罗电台广播，突尼斯政府在15日宣布同阿拉伯联合共和国断绝外交关系。
    阿拉伯联合共和国政府宣布，它已经请求伊拉克在突尼斯的代表照管阿联在突尼斯的利益。
    突尼斯的这项措施是在它的代表最近在阿拉伯联盟理事会会议上攻击阿联之后所采取的。据开罗电台广播，阿拉伯人士在评论这项措施时说，突尼斯为完成“帝国主义所策划由突尼斯来执行的阴谋”而同阿联断绝外交关系，是毫不奇怪的。
    据新华社开罗16日电　阿拉伯联盟理事会15日通过了苏丹代表提出的提案。这个提案说，理事会应当把它对于突尼斯代表在会上攻击阿拉伯联合共和国这件事的意见通知突尼斯政府，并且要求突尼斯参加联盟会议。
    这个提案是在会议主席、沙特阿拉伯首席代表法基赫阐明意见之后通过的。法基赫说，他赞成这个提案，但是这个提案应该包含这样一个意思，即理事会13日指责突尼斯行动的决议是正确的。他说，如果突尼斯代表同意参加会议的话，那应当意味着，它同意理事会的这一决议，并且不再提出这个问题。
    阿拉伯联合共和国和也门的代表在表决中弃权。
