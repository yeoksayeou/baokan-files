    Taiwan Compatriots Should Break Free from American Shackles and Return to the Embrace of the Motherland
    Democratic Parties Support Minister Peng Dehuai's Letter to Taiwan Compatriots
    Leaders of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) Advise Taiwan Military and Government Personnel: Abandon the United States Early, Don't Wait to Be Abandoned by the United States
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 7th, the Central Committee members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang in Beijing today earnestly advised the military and government personnel in Taiwan, hoping that they would proactively abandon American imperialism and return to the embrace of the motherland, instead of waiting to be abandoned by American imperialism.
    More than thirty Central Committee members and alternate members of the RCCK in Beijing held a meeting today. They discussed the current situation in the Taiwan Strait area and unanimously supported Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the RCCK, presided over the meeting.
    The attendees were all former heads of Kuomintang military and government organs. They resolutely denounced the criminal acts of American imperialism in occupying Taiwan and plotting to create "two Chinas," believing that American imperialism is the common enemy of compatriots on the mainland and the military and civilians in Taiwan. Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the RCCK, said: "The Taiwan issue is a matter for the Chinese people themselves. What does it have to do with the United States? We haven't exchanged fire with the Americans, so how can we talk about a ceasefire?" Cheng Qian emphasized: "To put it bluntly, the American intervention in Taiwan is not for the sake of Chiang Kai-shek, but for the purpose of invading China."
    Xiong Kewu, Weng Wenhao, Qian Changzhao, Hou Jingru, Lu Han, Chu Xichun, and others, in their successive speeches, all condemned the banditry of American imperialism. They said that the American aggressors do not care about morality for their own selfish interests. All patriotic Chinese compatriots should direct their guns at the outside world and resolutely oppose American aggression. As for American imperialism, they should still employ "the thirty-six stratagems, of which running away is the best." Otherwise, they will sink deeper and deeper, and ultimately suffer a shameful defeat.
    At the meeting, speakers also listed the facts of the motherland's growing strength, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek's fantasy of counterattacking the mainland is simply a joke, a dream. Cai Tingkai, Vice Chairman of the RCCK, said that Chiang Kai-shek has been in Taiwan for ten years. He hopes all day long that a third world war will break out so that he can take the opportunity to counterattack the mainland, but what a ridiculous dream this is!
    In their speeches, the attendees all advised the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan to deeply understand the righteousness, realize their errors, and seize this great opportunity to resolutely return to the embrace of the motherland. Zhang Zhizhong said that Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots demonstrated the utmost magnanimity and spirit of reconciliation towards the military and government personnel in Taiwan. He said that the so-called Taiwan issue was entirely created by American imperialism. If American imperialism had not occupied Taiwan, Taiwan and Taiwan compatriots would have been liberated long ago, no matter what method was used.
    Zhang Zhizhong emphasized, "American imperialism is unreliable, and this is understood by many military and government personnel in Taiwan." He said, "Since American imperialism is unreliable, since you know that American imperialism will eventually abandon you, why don't you quickly find a way out? Why don't you proactively abandon American imperialism?" Zhang Zhizhong hoped that the military and government personnel in Taiwan would not miss the opportunity, should understand well the spirit of reconciliation in Minister Peng Dehuai's message, and quickly return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Cheng Qian, Xiong Kewu, Huang Yong, Chen Shaoxian, and other speakers also pointed out that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu will be liberated sooner or later. The military and government personnel in Taiwan should put the motherland first, put the people first. The people of the motherland welcome them back to the embrace of the motherland; do not be obsessed and become the eternal sinners of the motherland.

    台湾同胞应挣脱美国枷锁回到祖国怀抱
    各民主党派拥护彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书
    民革中央领导人忠告台湾军政人员
    及早抛弃美国勿待被美国抛弃
    据新华社7日讯　在北京的中国国民党革命委员会的中央委员们，今日恳切地忠告台湾的军政人员，希望他们主动地抛弃美帝国主义，回到祖国的怀抱，而不要等待美帝国主义抛弃自己。
    三十多位在京的民革中央委员和候补委员们今天举行了集会。他们讨论了当前台湾海峡地区的形势，一致拥护彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书。民革中央委员会主席李济深主持了这次会议。
    到会的人都是前国民党军政机关的负责人，他们坚决斥责了美帝国主义霸占台湾并且阴谋制造“两个中国”的罪恶行为，认为美帝国主义是大陆同胞和台湾军民共同的敌人。民革副主席程潜说：“台湾问题是中国人民自己的事情，这同美国有什么相干呢？我们同美国人没有开枪，怎么能谈得上停火呢？”程潜强调指出：“说明白一点，美国人插手干涉台湾，目的并不是为了蒋介石，而是为了侵略中国。”
    熊克武、翁文灏、钱昌照、侯镜如、卢汉、楚溪春等人在先后发言中，都一致谴责了美帝国主义的强盗行为。他们说，美国侵略者为了它自己的私利，是不讲什么道义的，所有爱国的中国同胞，都应该枪口一致对外，坚决反对美国的侵略。而对于美帝国主义来说，他们还是“三十六计，走为上计”，否则他们会愈陷愈深，最终遭到可耻的失败。
    会上，发言的人还列举了祖国日益强大的事实，指出蒋介石幻想反攻大陆，那简直是笑话，是梦想。民革副主席蔡廷锴说，蒋介石逃到台湾已十年了，他整天希望打起第三次世界大战，以便趁机反攻大陆，但是这是多么可笑的梦想！
    到会的人在发言中，都忠告台湾国民党军政人员，应该深明大义，幡然悔悟，趁此大好机会，毅然决然回到祖国的怀抱里来。张治中说，彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书表现了对台湾军政人员的无限宽大和和解精神。他说，所谓台湾问题完全是美帝国主义一手造成的，如果美帝国主义没有侵占台湾，不论采取什么方式，台湾和台湾同胞早已得到解放了。
    张治中强调说，“美帝国主义是不可靠的，这一点就是台湾的许多军政人员也都明白。”他说：“既然美帝国主义不可靠，既然知道美帝国主义终要抛弃你们，为什么不敢快寻找出路？为什么不主动地抛弃美帝国主义呢？”张治中希望台湾军政人员不要坐失良机，应该很好了解彭德怀部长文告的和解精神，赶快回到祖国怀抱里来。
    程潜、熊克武、黄雍、陈劭先，和其他发言的人也都指出，台、澎、金、马迟早是要解放的，台湾的军政人员都应该以祖国为重，以人民为重，祖国人民欢迎他们回到祖国怀抱；不要执迷不悟，做祖国千载的罪人。
