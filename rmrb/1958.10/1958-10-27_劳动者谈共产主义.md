    Laborers Talk About Communism
    Communism and Piece-Rate Wages
    Communism has two stages, a lower and a higher, and socialism is its lower stage. Since bourgeois rights still exist in socialist society, the transition to communism requires not only abundant material production conditions, but also a significant increase in the masses' communist ideological awareness. In the past, when the masses' awareness was low and they considered personal interests more, the piece-rate wage system played a role in stimulating production. Now that the masses' awareness has increased, everyone believes that taking more and contributing less is shameful. Under these circumstances, piece-rate wages not only fail to continue to stimulate workers' enthusiasm for production, but become an obstacle to production development.

    Communism and People's Communes
    Relying on just one village or one township will not lead to communism. We cannot only see the small immediate benefits, but must see tomorrow and beyond. Transforming a depression into a rice paddy, opening canals, and building sluice gates would take ten years for just one village to complete. Furthermore, to run industries, science, culture and education, mechanization and electrification are unthinkable for just one village. Combining several villages together creates great strength. After the merger, you might be poorer and I might be richer at the moment, seeming like a small loss, but this is precisely for the great benefit of all. Those who only care about their own prosperity and not about others' poverty will never live a happy life. When merging into advanced cooperatives the year before last, some people complained about losses, which resulted in breaking up the cooperative and damaging production. What truly caused us losses were capitalist and individualistic thoughts.
    In the past, capitalist and individualistic ideas broke us apart. Now, collectivist and communist ideas have brought us together again. To achieve communism, we must first have communist ideas, and then communist large-scale collaboration and cooperation. The People's Commune is an organizational form for cultivating people's communist ideas and implementing communist large-scale cooperation.
                            Wang Shen, Jiadaowa People's Commune, Wuqing County
    Completely New People
    A person may have different abilities, but as long as he works without conditions, labors without remuneration, and can completely selflessly dedicate all his energy to society, he is a noble person, a pure person, a person with communist morality, and a person who has completely broken away from vulgar interests. Therefore, it can also be said that he is already a completely new communist person.
    Such new people should and must be produced in large numbers first among our working class.
                            Li Wenxing, Shanghai Shenxin Machinery Factory Worker
    This Road is Set
    We, the proletariat, have the farthest vision. How much we long for the early arrival of a communist society! Today, the Party is leading us in vigorously running people's communes, and everyone is smiling from the bottom of their hearts. The ideal is about to be realized, and the road to communism is not far away. In particular, the minds of the Chinese people have already planted the red flag of communism. As soon as communism is mentioned, no one is not devoted to it. The path proposed by the Party, from semi-supply system and supply system to gradually moving towards the "each according to his needs" communist system, no matter what difficulties there may be, we have decided to take this road!
                        Yan Naigeng, Typesetting Worker, China Youth Daily Printing Factory

    劳动者谈共产主义
    共产主义和计件工资
    共产主义有低级和高级两个阶段，社会主义是它的低级阶段。社会主义社会既然存在着资产阶级法权思想的残余，过渡到共产主义不但需要有丰富的物质生产条件，还需要群众共产主义思想觉悟的大大提高。计件工资制在过去群众觉悟低、考虑个人利益较多的时候，曾经起过刺激生产的作用。现在群众觉悟提高了，大家认为拿得多贡献得少是可耻的。在这种情况下，计件工资不仅不能继续刺激工人的生产积极性，反而成为阻碍生产发展的东西了。

    共产主义和人民公社
    只靠一个村、一个乡到不了共产主义，我们不能光看到眼前一点小利益，要看到明天和更远。把洼地变成水稻田，开渠、建闸，只一个村去做十年也完不成。再要办工业、办科学办文化教育，机械化和电气化，只靠一个村连想也不能想。几个村合起来，力量就大了。合并后，眼下也可能你穷些我富些，好像是吃点小亏，可是这正是为了全体都得大利，只管自己富裕，不管别人受穷的人，他也永远过不到幸福生活。前年并高级社时，有的人就嚷吃亏，结果把社搅散了，生产也闹坏了，真正让我们吃了亏的还是资本主义思想和个人主义思想。
    以前，资本主义和个人主义思想，把我们冲开了，现在集体主义和共产主义思想又把我们合在了一起，要实现共产主义就要先有共产主义思想，还要有共产主义的大协作和大合作。人民公社就是一种培养人们的共产主义思想和实行共产主义大合作的组织形式。

    完全的新人
    一个人能力有大小，但只要他工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬，能够完全忘我的把全部精力献给社会，他就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有共产主义道德的人，一个完全脱离了低级趣味的人。因此，也可以说他已经是完全的共产主义新人了。
    这样的新人，应该而且一定要先在我们工人阶级中大量产生。
                            上海申新机器厂工人　李文兴
    这条路走定了
    我们无产阶级的眼光，看得最远。我们多么渴望着共产主义社会的早日到来呀！今天党领导我们大办人民公社，人人心里都笑开了花。理想就要实现了，往共产主义的路已经没有多远了。特别是我国人民的思想，已经插上共产主义红旗，只要一提到共产主义，没有不倾心的。党提出的由半供给制、供给制，然后逐步走到“各取所需”的共产主义的道路，不管再有什么困难，我们算是走定了这条路！
