    Anhui Produces 6,382 Tons of Iron in One Day
    (Our Hefei Dispatch, September 30th) Over 4.5 million iron and steel workers in Anhui Province, as a gift to National Day, increased the daily pig iron production from 3,275.3 tons on the 28th to 6,382.9 tons on the 29th, an increase of 94.88%. Two counties produced over 1,000 tons. Among them, Yuexi County in Anqing Prefecture produced 1,498 tons of iron; Jinzhai County in Lu'an Prefecture produced 1,366.4 tons of iron. The pig iron production in Ma'anshan City increased from 1,129 tons on the 28th to 1,515 tons. A large number of high-yield furnaces have emerged in various places. According to statistics from four counties in Anqing Prefecture alone, there are 45 small indigenous furnaces with a volume of 0.5 cubic meters producing more than one ton per day; and 106 producing more than half a ton per day. In the third district of Jinzhai County, 68 small blast furnaces with a volume of about 0.5 cubic meters produce more than 4 tons per day, of which 26 produce more than 5 tons. The Hero People's Commune put 70 furnaces into production on the 29th, producing a total of 210.09 tons of iron, an average of 3 tons per furnace.
    The reasons for the sudden increase in production on the 29th are: First, from the province to the township and commune, Party committees at all levels are going all out to regard iron and steel production as an overriding task. From top to bottom, secretaries are taking the lead. Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Huang Yan, Secretary of the Secretariat, and other leaders, personally went to Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Anqing, Lu'an and other places to supervise the battle. The provincial leading organs transferred more than 800 cadres to form working groups to help local Party committees organize and mobilize the masses to carry out iron and steel production in key iron-producing areas. Party committee secretaries at all levels stayed by the furnaces day and night to direct operations. Second, vigorously organize and mobilize the masses to form a mass movement, especially emphasizing mobilizing the masses to rush to make crucibles for iron smelting. The broad masses in Anqing and Lu'an Prefectures panned sand for iron smelting. In Lu'an Prefecture alone, more than 2 million people were mobilized. In this battle, cadres and the masses demonstrated a high degree of communist spirit. When there was a shortage of wood for making bellows, they contributed floorboards and console tables to make bellows. If there were not enough chicken feathers for making bellows, they killed chickens to get feathers. If sandboxes were not made in time, they used their own door panels to make them. Third, the province implemented unified allocation and unified control over the supply of mining raw materials, transportation, etc. In particular, a headquarters was specially organized for transportation work in various places, and command posts were set up at transportation hubs such as Yuxikou, Bengbu, Fuliji, Fanchang, Ma'anshan, and Anqing to be responsible for the transportation of southern ore to the north and northern coal to the south, ensuring that the iron and steel marshal has a sufficient supply of "grain."

    安徽一天出铁6382吨
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省四百五十多万钢铁大军，为国庆节献礼，在29日一天把生铁产量由28日三千二百七十五点三吨提高到六千三百八十二点九吨，增长了94.88％。并出现了二个千吨以上的县。其中安庆专区岳西县产铁一千四百九十八吨；六安专区金寨县产铁一千三百六十六点四吨。马鞍山市的生铁产量由28日的一千一百二十九吨，提高到一千五百一十五吨。各地并出现了大批高产炉，仅安庆专区四个县统计：零点五立方公尺的小土炉，日产一吨以上的有四十五座；日产半吨以上的有一百零六座。金寨县第三区零点五立方公尺左右的小高炉，日产四吨以上的有六十八座，其中五吨以上的有二十六座，英雄人民公社29日投入生产的七十个炉，共产铁二百一十点零九吨，平均每炉产三吨。
    29日产量突然增长的原因是：一、从省到乡、社，各级党委全力以赴把钢铁生产当成压倒一切的任务。从上到下书记挂帅，省委第一书记曾希圣和书记处书记黄岩等领导人，都亲赴马鞍山、芜湖、安庆、六安等地督战。省的领导机关，抽调八百多名干部组成工作组，到重点产铁地区帮助当地党委组织和发动群众，进行钢铁生产，各地党委书记都日夜守候在炉边，指挥作战。二、大力组织和发动群众形成群众运动，特别强调发动群众赶制坩埚炼铁，安庆、六安专区广大群众淘沙炼铁，仅六安专区就发动了二百多万人。在这场战斗中，干部和群众发挥了高度的共产主义精神。缺乏制造风箱的木料，他们就献出楼板、条几来造风箱。造风箱用的鸡毛不够，他们就杀鸡取毛。沙箱赶制不及他们就用自家的门板来制造。三、全省对采矿原料供应、运输等都实行了统一调配统一掌握。其中特别是运输工作各地都专门组织了指挥部，在交通要点如裕溪口、蚌埠、符离集、繁昌、马鞍山、安庆等地设指挥部负责南矿北运、北煤南运等工作，保证了钢铁元帅有足够的“粮食”供应。
