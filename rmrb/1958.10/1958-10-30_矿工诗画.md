    Miner Poems and Paintings
    The poems and paintings in this column are all works by workers from the Mentougou Coal Mine in Beijing.
    Taking Treasure
    Che Fangxu, a coal mine worker, has high aspirations. His revolutionary drive is truly excellent. He goes deep into the dragon's pool and tiger's den, determined to extract underground treasures.
    Fierce Battle by the Coal Seam
    Gao Hongji We are fiercely battling by the coal seam, hating the American imperialists for being too rampant. The anger in our hearts turns into strength. Drilling holes, blasting, and supporting the rock. Determined to surpass England with great enthusiasm, our tunneling speed rivals rockets. The miners' ambition is as grand as mountains. It's not difficult for "satellites" to go into space.
    Well Water
    Li Fuzheng The workers' labor is truly admirable, not afraid of exerting effort and sweating. Their strength is like well water, inexhaustible and never-ending.
    Battlefield
    Liang Xianghuan The mine is the battlefield, the surface is the rear, the coal seam is Taiwan, and the rock is the Chiang gang.
    Steel and Iron
    Zhao Xueyi Molten steel flows, molten iron flows, flowing all over the provinces and cities of the country, rolling like the Yangtze River, ceaselessly day and night.
    Diary
    Li Jiajun The whistle sounds, I am so happy to change into my work clothes and go to work. I clearly remember the work tasks, and after going down the well, I work harder. The whistle sounds, work is over, after taking a bath, I turn the pages of my book, learning to sing and studying culture, and then writing a poem when I get back. (Attached picture)

    矿工诗画
    这一栏的诗和画，都是北京门头沟煤矿工人的作品。
    取宝
    车方旭煤矿工人志气高，革命干劲真正好，深入龙潭和虎穴，坚决取出地下宝。
    激战在煤层旁
    高鸿吉我们激战在煤层旁，愤恨美帝太猖狂，胸中怒火变力量，打眼放炮把岩装。决心超英干劲大，掘进速度赛火箭，矿工壮志大如山，“卫星”上天不费难。
    井泉水
    李福正工人劳动真可观，不怕出力和出汗，力气好比井泉水，用不尽来流不完。
    战场
    梁向焕井下就是战场，地面就是后方，煤层就是台湾，岩石就是蒋帮。
    钢和铁
    赵学义钢水流，铁水流，流遍全国省市州，滚滚好似长江水，日夜不停休。
    日记
    李家骏汽笛响，好喜欢，换上工装去上班。工作任务记清楚，下井之后加油干。汽笛响，下了班，洗澡之后把书翻，学了唱歌学文化，回来又写诗一篇。（附图片）
