    Lingyuan County Machinery Factory
    Should Improve the Quality of Hillside Ploughs
    It is currently the time for deep plowing and autumn planting, and the demand for hillside plows is very urgent in various places. The more than 260 hillside plows purchased by our station were quickly sold out. However, some of these hillside plows are of poor quality and break after a short period of use. Some even break before plowing a single furrow (at a depth of less than three inches). For example, of the 20 units purchased by the Sihe Cooperative of the Xi Wuguan Yingzi district in our county, 17 broke, and the other three are too risky to use. The Hongqi Cooperative bought five units, and three broke. Now they are all coming to our station to request returns. These hillside plows are produced by the Lingyuan County Machinery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Liaoning Province. Their production of such low-quality agricultural tools greatly affects the current autumn plowing. In addition to requesting relevant departments in Lingyuan County to inspect the factory's product quality, we also request that the factory be responsible for repairing this batch of poor-quality hillside plows.

    凌源县机械厂
    应提高山地犁质量
    目前正是深翻地秋种的时候，各地需要山地犁很迫切，由我站购进的二百六十余台山地犁，很快就销光了。但是这批山地犁，有一部分质量不好用不了多长时间就断了，有的甚至翻不到一条垅就断了（深度不到三寸）。如我县西五官营子四合社买去的二十台，就断了十七台，另外三台也不敢用了。红旗社买去五台，断了三台。现在他们都来我站要求退货。这批山地犁是辽宁省地方国营凌源县机械厂生产的，他们生产出这样质量低劣的农具，大大的影响了当前秋翻地的进行。我们除要求凌源县有关部门对该厂的产品质量进行检查外，并要求该厂对这批质量不好的山地犁负责修理。
