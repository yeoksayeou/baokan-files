    New Things, Old Traditions
    Soldier Wang Guixing: General goes to the company to be a private, a new thing I've never seen before. I lay in bed, happy in my heart, my eyelids wouldn't close. The wake-up call sounded, and the general busily swept the floor. I jumped out of bed to take the broom from him, and he said: It's all the same whether you or I sweep. After eating, we went to practice aiming. The general was really eager to learn. The platoon leader explained the essentials in front of the line, and he wrote them all down in his notebook. The north wind howled, and sweat streamed down the general's face. The platoon leader told him to take a break, but he said: How can I get excellent if I don't practice? The rest call sounded, and the general came to tell stories, recounting the five encirclement and suppression campaigns and the crossing of the Jinsha River. In the evening, a squad meeting was held, and the general stood up to give a report. Only after the squad leader approved it did he begin to speak. The general takes the lead in everything, and we try to catch up with him, practicing hard and working harder, learning from the general and leaping forward.

    新事情　老传统
    战士　王贵兴将军下连当列兵，从未见过的新事情，我躺在床上心里乐，上下眼皮合不拢。起床哨子嘟嘟响，将军嚓嚓扫地忙，我跳下床去和他夺，他说：你扫我扫都一
  样。吃过饭，去瞄准，将军学习真虚心，排长队前讲要领，他一一写上笔记本。北风刮的嗖嗖嗖，将军脸上汗直流，排长叫他歇一歇，他说：不练怎能打优秀。休息哨子嘟嘟响，将军来把故事讲，说罢五次反围剿，又说抢渡金沙江。晚上召开班务会，将军起立把报告喊，等到班长批准后，他才开始来发言。将军样样带头干，我们把他来追赶，猛练苦练加油练，学习将军跃向前。
