    Not a Single Grain Allowed to Mold
    Dayi County Learns a Lesson and Strengthens Grain Storage Work

    (Our report) The Dayi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently organized a large number of cadres to conduct a large-scale general survey of grain storage work throughout the county. They promptly mobilized the masses to deal with grain that was heating up, molding, sprouting, or being eaten by insects.

    Dayi County, Sichuan Province, had an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, with rice production alone increasing by more than 300 million jin. However, due to a lack of sufficient preparation for storage work, a large amount of grain experienced moisture absorption, high temperatures, sprouting, mold, and insect infestation. According to a preliminary inspection of more than 70 million jin of grain, over 10 million jin had been damaged to varying degrees. In Sancha Township, damaged grain accounted for more than 40% of the total stored grain. The Fourth Team of Anren People's Commune stored more than 40,000 jin of grain, of which 30,000 jin had become moldy and spoiled.

    The reasons for the severe damage to grain, in addition to insufficient equipment, were mainly due to the fact that many cadres neglected grain storage work, saying things like, "Anyway, there is plenty of grain, it doesn't matter if a little is damaged." They thought that as long as the grain was harvested and put into the warehouse, everything would be fine. At the same time, many places did not comprehensively arrange labor when engaging in central tasks such as steelmaking and autumn harvesting and planting, and many warehouses were completely unattended. After mold was discovered in the grain in Hanzhen Township, the villagers suggested quickly turning it over and drying it, but Yang Kaiyu, the secretary of the general branch, said: "Deep plowing is important, no drying of grain; if the grain rots, use it to make wine."

    The Dayi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that protecting the fruits of the harvest and not allowing a single grain to be damaged again is a major event for the entire party and the entire people. It called on cadres throughout the county to take emergency measures to do a good job in grain storage. 1. Comprehensively arrange labor. While carrying out deep plowing, immediately organize 30,000 people to conduct a general clearing, drying, air-drying, cooling, and shifting of grain in all granaries throughout the county. 2. Implement political command, improve the grain storage system, and have the grain department hold training classes to provide technical training to storage personnel. 3. For grain that has already been damaged, quickly process it for different purposes, such as making wine.

### 不准霉烂一粒粮  大邑县接受教训加强粮食保管工作

    不准霉烂一粒粮
    大邑县接受教训加强粮食保管工作
    本报讯　中共大邑县委会最近组织大批干部，对全县粮食保管工作进行了一次大规模的普查，对于发热、霉烂、生芽、虫吃的粮食，及时发动群众进行了处理。
    四川大邑县今年空前丰收，仅稻谷就增产三亿多斤。但是对收藏工作缺乏充分准备，以致大批粮食发生反潮、高烧、生芽、霉烂和虫害现象。据初步检查的七千多万斤粮食中，发生不同程度损坏的就达一千多万斤。三岔乡损坏粮达库存粮总数的40％多。安仁人民公社四中队保存的四万多斤粮食，有三万斤发生了霉坏。
    造成粮食严重损坏的原因，除设备不够外，最主要的是由于许多干部忽视了粮食保管工作，说什么“反正粮食多得很，损坏一点没关系”。以为只要把粮食收回来，放进了仓就算万事大吉。同时许多地方在大搞炼钢和秋收秋种等中心工作时，没有对劳动力进行全面安排，许多仓库完全处于无人负责的状态。韩镇乡发现粮食霉烂后，社员建议要赶快翻晒，总支书记杨开余却说：“深耕重要，不准晒粮；粮食沤烂了，拿来烤酒。”
    中共大邑县委指出，保卫丰收果实，不让再损坏一颗粮食，是全党全民的大事。号召全县干部采取紧急措施，做好粮食保管工作。一、全面安排劳力，在进行深耕同时，立即组织三万群众对全县粮仓，普遍进行一次清仓、翻晒、风干、摊凉、倒仓工作。二、实行政治挂帅，健全粮食保管制度，并由粮食部门召开训练班，对保管人员进行技术训练。三、对于已经发生损坏的粮食，分别不同情况，迅速进行加工、蒸酒等处理工作。
