This newspaper reports from Nanjing on October 5th: The Ministry of Agriculture recently convened an on-site meeting at Nanjing Agricultural College to exchange experiences on integrating education with production in national higher agricultural colleges. The meeting summarized the basic experiences of implementing the combination of education and productive labor over the past year, and, based on central instructions, focused on discussing and studying measures to send all teachers and students of existing higher agricultural colleges to the countryside for labor training starting in the second half of this year.

Sending teachers and students of existing higher agricultural colleges to the countryside to participate in productive labor in a planned way and moving classrooms to the fields is a major revolution in the teaching system of national agricultural colleges and an important measure to cultivate agricultural technical talents of the working class who are both red and expert. In the past year, after the national higher agricultural colleges implemented the work-study program, the schools successively sent more than 14,000 teachers and students to the countryside for labor training, established more than 400 factories on campus, and introduced more than 5,500 technical innovations, of which nearly 300 reached advanced levels at home and abroad. The schools have begun to show a new situation of combining education, scientific research, and production. In this process, the serious shortcomings of school education being divorced from politics and divorced from practical production have also been further exposed. The education of agricultural colleges is far from being able to adapt to the leap-forward situation in the countryside, so a more thorough revolution must be carried out in the education system and teaching methods. Regarding this revolutionary measure, the meeting conducted enthusiastic airing of views, discussions, and debates, unified understanding, and formulated a preliminary plan: 1. Do a good job in political and ideological mobilization to make the broad masses of teachers and students understand that going to the countryside for labor training for a certain period of time is the correct path to thoroughly transform their thinking, become both red and expert, and integrate theory with practice. The fallacies of the bourgeoisie who believe that going to the countryside for labor “can only make you red but not expert” must be thoroughly criticized. 2. In the practice of labor, gradually establish and consolidate the proletarian viewpoint, the labor viewpoint, the mass viewpoint, and the dialectical materialist viewpoint; learn a set of agricultural production skills, and on this basis, systematically summarize the high-yield experiences created by farmers; under the leadership of the Party committee, adopt the method of combining teachers, students, and farmers, carry out large-scale airing of views, debates, destruction, and construction, and rewrite teaching outlines and textbooks that completely serve proletarian politics and are suitable for local production needs; at the same time, conduct on-site teaching in labor, learning while doing and teaching, and creating a new teaching experience that combines teaching, scientific research, and practical production. 3. In the organizational structure of sending labor down, adopt a mixed formation of teachers and students from different majors to facilitate solving difficult problems in production practice, researching and summarizing high-yield experiences, and improving the quality of academic research. The dispatched teachers and students are also assigned in a planned way according to the needs of the region. 4. The dispatched teachers and students are all under the leadership of the local Party committee, and the school assigns responsible cadres to assist the local Party committee in its work. The meeting also discussed the issue of some teachers and students staying at the school. In addition to conducting teaching for a certain period of time, the teachers and students remaining at school will continue to run farms and factories in a big way, so that the school is a farm and a factory, and the students are workers and farmers. The meeting also emphasized tapping potential, self-reliance, and running enterprises diligently and frugally.

The meeting was intense and enthusiastic. After listening to the introduction of Nanjing Agricultural College and visiting the site, the representatives put forward the slogan "Learn from Nanjing Agricultural College, Catch up with Nanjing Agricultural College, and Surpass Nanjing Agricultural College." A total of 152 people from 60 new and old higher agricultural colleges across the country participated in this on-site meeting. The meeting started on September 21st and ended on October 2nd. Chen Zhaoxuan, Assistant Minister of Agriculture, gave a concluding speech.

    在田头上课　向农民学习
    全国高等农业院校师生将一律下放到农村劳动锻炼
    本报南京5日电　中央农业部最近在南京农学院召开了全国高等农业院校教育结合生产的经验交流现场会议。会议总结了一年来贯彻教育和劳动生产相结合的基本经验，并根据中央指示着重讨论和研究了从本年下半年起，把现有高等农校的师生一律下放农村劳动锻炼的措施。
    把现有高等农业院校师生有计划地下放到农村参加生产劳动，把课堂搬到田间去，这是全国农业院校教学制度上的一个重大的革命，是培养工人阶级的又红又专的农业技术人材的重要措施。近一年来，全国高等农校贯彻勤工俭学后，各校先后下放师生一万四千余人到农村劳动锻炼，在校内开办了四百多个工厂，出现了五千五百多项技术革新，其中近三百项达到国内外先进水平，学校开始呈现了教育、科学研究、生产三结合的新局面。在这个过程中，也进一步暴露了学校教育脱离政治、脱离生产实际的严重缺点，农业院校的教育远远不能适应农村一日千里的跃进形势，因此必须在教育制度和教学方法上来一个更彻底的革命。对于这一具有革命意义的措施，会议进行了热烈的鸣放、座谈和辩论，统一了认识，并制定了初步方案：一、做好政治思想发动工作，使广大师生了解在一定时期内下放农村劳动锻炼，是彻底改造思想、走又红又专、理论联系实际的正确道路。对那些认为下放劳动“只能红不能专”的资产阶级的谬论，必须彻底批判。二、在劳动的实践中，逐步树立和巩固无产阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点和辩证唯物主义观点；学会农业生产的一套本领，在这个基础上，系统地总结农民已创造出来的丰产经验；在党委领导下，采取教师、学生、农民三结合的方法，大鸣大放、大争大辩、大破大立，重新编写出完全为无产阶级政治服务，并适合本地生产需要的教学大纲和教材；同时在劳动中进行现场教学，边做、边教、边学，创造出一套教学、科学研究和生产实际三者相结合的崭新的教学经验。三、在下放劳动的组织编制上，采取不同专业的师生混合编队，以利于解决生产实践中的困难问题，研究、总结丰产经验，和提高学术研究质量。下放师生也按地区需要有计划地分配。四、下放师生一律受当地党委领导，学校指派负责干部协助当地党委进行工作。会议同时讨论了部分师生留校问题。留校师生除进行一定时间的教学外，继续大办农场、工厂，作到学校就是农场、工厂，学生就是工人、农民。会议还强调挖掘潜力，自立更生，勤俭办企业。
    会议进行得紧张热烈。代表们在听了南京农学院的介绍和实地参观后，提出了“学南农、赶南农、超南农”的口号。参加这次现场会议的全国新老高等农校，共六十个单位，一百五十二人。会议从9月21日开始到10月2日结束，由农业部部长助理陈照轩作总结发言。
