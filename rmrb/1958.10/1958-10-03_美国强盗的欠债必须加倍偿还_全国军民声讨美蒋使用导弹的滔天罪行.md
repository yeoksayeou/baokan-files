Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The serious provocative incident in which Chiang Kai-shek's air force, under U.S. direction, used missile weapons to attack our mainland air force has aroused immense anger among the people on the Fujian front and throughout the country. They unanimously expressed their support for the statement of our Ministry of National Defense spokesman and their determination to give the provocateurs a punitive blow.

The entire commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army's three services on the Fujian front are extremely angry at the crime of U.S. imperialism in directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' air force to use missile weapons to attack our air force. They stated that they must retaliate in kind and give the Chiang Kai-shek army a hundredfold heavy punitive blow.

In the past two days, frontline air force commanders and fighters have held meetings at airports and near airplanes, all filled with anger, determined to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy. Chen Yishu and Cheng Kaixin, pilots of a certain unit who shot down two U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes on August 13, said, "We are soldiers defending the motherland's airspace and must punish the aerial bandits and demand justice for our sacrificed comrades." Wei Yuanwu, commander of a certain artillery unit, said, "The serious incident of U.S. imperialism directing the Chiang Kai-shek air force to use 'Sidewinder' missiles once again proves that U.S. imperialism is frantically intensifying the tension in the Taiwan Strait and undermining peace in the Far East and the world. We must give the Chiang Kai-shek army an even heavier counterblow." Su Zhiming, deputy commander of a torpedo boat who has been awarded a first-class meritorious service, pointed out, "No weapons can save the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's army. This new armed provocation by U.S. imperialism against our country can only tighten the noose around its own neck. Our frontline naval soldiers are determined to fight even more bravely to defend the motherland, eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous army, and liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal."

At one second past midnight on the 1st, artillery units on the front line launched a punitive strike against the Chiang Kai-shek army on Jinmen Island under the bright moonlight. They poured a large number of shells onto the enemy's positions, ushering in the morning of National Day amidst the rumbling of artillery fire.

The air force and anti-aircraft artillery units guarding the motherland's airspace with a hundredfold vigilance have entered "first-level combat readiness." Air force pilots are determined to destroy enemy's new weapons, such as "Sidewinder" missiles, no matter what they use.

The People's Liberation Army garrison in the Wenzhou area immediately held meetings after learning about the Chiang Kai-shek army's use of missiles, launching a new wave of anger against U.S. imperialist military provocations. Zhong Guangrong, a first-class combat hero, said that no new weapons can scare the Chinese people, and U.S. missiles cannot save Chiang Kai-shek from his fate of death. Chen Wenchuan, a pilot who shot down two U.S. planes in Korea, said, "We must turn our anger into strength, severely punish Chiang Kai-shek's air force, and reduce the Chiang Kai-shek air force to ashes in our anger."

General Zhang Mingyuan, head of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Kim Jong-young, chairman of the People's Committee of the county where they are stationed in Korea, spoke at a celebration of China's National Day, denouncing the new crimes of the American aggressors in expanding their aggression. They said that if the American aggressors dare to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese and Korean people will give the aggressors a devastating blow, just as they eliminated their common enemy in the past.

After seeing the news that the Chiang Kai-shek army was using "Sidewinder" missiles supplied by U.S. imperialism, the people of the capital shouted in unison: "Severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army that recognizes the enemy as its father!" "All debts owed by the American robbers must be repaid!"

The officers and soldiers of the Beijing garrison were filled with indignation. The artillery soldiers who were preparing for the National Day parade asked their superiors to allow them to strike the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. The male and female commanders and fighters of the militia divisions from all over the country who came to Beijing to receive Chairman Mao's review were all so angry that they waved their arms and clenched their fists. All members of the "Jiulan Group" building the Ming Tombs Reservoir have become heroic female militia members. They said heroically that our country is now a nation of soldiers, and 650 million people, each kicking once, would kick the American aggressors out of the Taiwan area. Why don't the U.S. imperialists open their eyes and see that missiles cannot scare us!

The Guangzhou people, with high morale, expressed great anger at the crime of the Chiang Kai-shek air force attacking our mainland air force with missile weapons under the direction of U.S. imperialism. Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou, as well as workers, peasants, government officials, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, held meetings on the morning of the 30th, sternly warning the U.S. imperialists about this serious military provocation, saying that the fire they ignited would burn them to death.

The people of Shanghai expressed great anger at the crime of U.S. imperialism directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force to attack our air force with missiles, demanding an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, and resolutely retaliating against the aggressors with redoubled force!

The Navy and Army of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai protested one after another, and more than 1,000 sailors of the East China Sea Fleet held a protest meeting.

The already immense anger of the people of Wuhan against U.S. imperialism has intensified. After seeing the news in the newspapers that the American aggressors were directing the Chiang Kai-shek gang to launch missile attacks against us, the 400,000-strong iron and steel army of Wuhan erupted in anger. Standing beside thousands of iron-smelting furnaces, they vowed in unison to support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions such as producing more steel to smash the heads of the provocateurs.

Workers in Shenyang, who are fighting for steel and striving to let the Mechanical Marshal take command as soon as possible, held meetings and discussions after seeing the statement by the spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense in the newspaper, angrily protesting the heinous crimes of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek robbers, and resolutely expressing their determination to severely punish the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek war criminals. If steel is needed, we will provide steel; if people are needed, we will provide people. The entire workers of the No. 1 Steelmaking Workshop of the Shenyang Iron and Steel Plant will increase production by another 1,000 tons of steel in the next three months to support the liberation of Taiwan.

Everywhere in Xi'an's factories, schools, government agencies, and streets, a chorus of voices demanding revenge rang out. More than 100,000 workers from factories such as the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, Qing'an Machinery Factory, and the Mechanical Manufacturing Plant of the Shaanxi Provincial Coal Industry Bureau held combat oath-taking meetings and denunciation meetings in workshops and near furnaces. Shi Linge, an old worker at the Xi'an Enamel Factory, patted his chest and said, "The American robbers are like foxes, pretending to negotiate with us while directing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to use missiles to scare us. This is a shameless rogue tactic. If the American robbers dare to continue to invade us, I will risk my old life to kill a few American devils!"

Many factories, government agencies, schools, people's communes, and troops in Chengdu and Chongqing, Sichuan Province, held meetings to protest this new provocative act by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek clique. Soldiers of a certain unit of the Chengdu Air Force said at a meeting that as long as the motherland needs it, they will resolutely fly their planes to give the Chiang Kai-shek air force a head-on blow. Yu Guang, the squadron leader who served as the wingman for first-class hero and special-class merit recipient Lu Min during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said, "We defeated the 'air superiority' boasted by the U.S. Air Force on the Korean battlefield. Today, our strength is even greater. U.S. missiles will never scare us, and we will certainly give a punitive counterblow to the crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek air force."

The people of Hebei Province and Tianjin, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi and other places also stated that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with. No missile or atomic bomb can scare the Chinese people. We will use redoubled strength to strike the provocateurs and defend the safety of the motherland. (Attached picture)

    全国军民声讨美蒋使用导弹的滔天罪行
    据新华社讯　蒋介石空军在美国指使下，使用导弹武器向我大陆空军进攻的严重的挑衅事件，激起了福建前线和全国各界人民的无比愤怒，一致表示拥护我国防部发言人的声明，坚决给挑衅者以惩罚性的打击。
    中国人民解放军福建前线陆海空三军的全体指挥员、战斗员对美帝国主义指使蒋匪空军用导弹武器向我空军进攻的罪行，感到极大愤怒。他们表示，一定要以眼还眼，以牙还牙，给蒋匪军以百倍沉重的惩罚打击。
    前线空军指战员这两天纷纷在机场上、飞机旁举行集会，个个怒气冲天地决心严惩蒋贼军，粉碎美国的侵略阴谋。曾在8月13日击伤美制蒋机两架的某部飞行员陈怡恕和程开信说，我们是保卫祖国领空的战士，一定要惩罚空中强盗，为牺牲的战友讨还血债。某炮兵部队指挥员魏垣武说，美帝国主义指使蒋匪空军使用“响尾蛇”导弹的严重事件，再次证明美帝国主义正在疯狂地加深台湾海峡的紧张局势，破坏远东和世界的和平。我们一定要给蒋贼军以更加沉重的回击。某鱼雷快艇副艇长、立过一等功的宿芝明指出，任何武器都挽救不了蒋介石军队的灭亡。美帝国主义对我国这种新的武装挑衅，只能使它把套在自己脖子上的绞索越套越紧。我们前线海军战士，决心为保卫祖国、消灭蒋介石卖国军队和解放金门马祖而更加奋勇作战，不达目的绝不收兵。
    1日零时一秒，前线炮兵各个连队在皎洁的月光下向金门岛的蒋匪军进行了惩罚性的打击。他们把大批炮弹倾泻在敌人的阵地上，在隆隆的炮声中迎来了国庆节的清晨。
    百倍警惕地把守着祖国领空的空军部队和高射炮兵部队已进入“一级战备”状态。空军飞行员们则决心不论敌人使用什么“响尾蛇”导弹等新式武器，也要把它击毁。
    人民解放军温州地区驻军获悉蒋军使用导弹的消息后，立即集会，掀起了新的反对美帝国主义军事挑衅的怒潮。一等战斗功臣中光荣说，任何新式武器都是吓不倒中国人民，美国导弹也万万挽救不了蒋介石死亡的命运。在朝鲜击落过美机两架的飞行员陈文川说，我们一定要把愤怒化为力量，狠狠地惩罚蒋介石空军，叫蒋贼空军在我们的怒火中化为灰烬。
    志愿军部队首长张明远将军和驻地朝鲜郡人民委员会委员长金正英在庆祝我国国庆的会上讲话，斥责美国侵略者扩大侵略的新罪行。他们说，如果美国侵略者胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国和朝鲜人民会像过去消灭共同敌人一样，给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。
    首都各界人民看到蒋军使用美帝国主义供给的“响尾蛇”导弹的消息后举城一致的吼声：“严厉惩罚认贼作父的蒋匪军！”“美国强盗的一切欠债必须偿还！”
    驻京部队的官兵们都气愤填胸，正在迎接国庆检阅的炮兵战士们，纷纷要求上级准许他们去打击蒋贼军。来自全国各地接受毛主席检阅的民兵师的男女指战员们个个气得挥臂磨拳。建设十三陵水库的“九兰组”全体成员已成了英武的女民兵。她们都豪壮地说，现在我们国家已全民皆兵了，六亿五千万人，每人踢一脚也会把美国侵略者从台湾地区踢出去。美帝国主义者怎不睁眼看一看，导弹怎么会吓得了我们！
    斗志昂扬的广州市各界人民，对蒋贼空军在美帝指使下使用导弹武器进攻我大陆空军的罪行表示极大的愤怒。中国人民解放军驻广州部队官兵，以及工人、农民、机关、各民主党派、各人民团体在30日上午都纷纷举行集会，严厉警告美帝国主义这种严重的军事挑衅行为，他们点起的火会把他们自己烧死的。
    上海市人民对美帝国主义指使蒋贼空军用导弹向我空军进攻的罪行表示极大的愤怒，要求以眼还眼、以牙还牙，坚决以加倍的还击侵略者！
    人民解放军驻上海的海军、陆军都纷纷表示抗议，东海舰队一千多水兵举行了抗议集会。
    武汉市各界人民对美帝国主义已经万分愤怒的情绪更趋高涨了，武汉四十万炼铁炼钢大军从报纸上看到美国侵略者指使蒋匪帮对我进行导弹攻击的消息后怒火迸发，他们站在上千座炼铁炉旁同声宣誓，用炼出更多的钢铁等实际行动支援解放军用这些钢铁敲碎挑衅者的脑袋。
    正在为钢铁而战，争取早日让机械元帅升帐的沈阳市工人，从报上看到国防部发言人的声明以后，纷纷集会座谈，无比愤怒的抗议美蒋强盗的滔天罪行，坚决表示严惩美蒋战争罪犯，要钢有钢，要人有人。沈阳钢铁厂第一炼钢车间全体工人要在今后的三个月里再增产一千吨钢来支援解放台湾。
    西安的工厂、学校、机关和街道里到处响起了一片要求复仇的声音。西安人民搪瓷厂、庆安机器厂和陕西省煤炭工业局机械制造厂等工厂十多万工人在车间和炉旁纷纷举行战斗誓师会、声讨会。西安搪瓷厂老工人师林阁拍着胸膛说：“美国强盗和狐狸一样一，面假装和我们谈判，一面指使蒋匪军用导弹来吓唬我们，这是一种无耻的流氓手段。美国强盗若敢继续侵犯我们，我拼上这条老命也要杀死它几个美国鬼子！”
    四川省成都市和重庆市许多工厂、机关、学校、人民公社和部队举行集会，抗议美蒋这一新的挑衅行为。成都空军部队某部战士们在集会上表示，只要祖国需要，他们就坚决驾飞机给蒋贼空军以迎头痛击。曾经在抗美援朝战争期间担任过一级英雄、特等功臣鲁珉僚机的中队长于光说：“我们曾在朝鲜战场上打垮了美国空军吹嘘的‘空中优势’，今天我们的力量更强大了，美国的导弹决吓不倒我们，我们对蒋介石空军犯下的罪行必将给以惩罚性的回击。”
    河北省和天津市、内蒙古、广西等地人民，也纷纷表示中国人民不是好惹的，什么导弹、原子弹都吓不倒中国人民，我们要以加倍的力量，打击挑衅者。保卫祖国的安全。（附图片）
