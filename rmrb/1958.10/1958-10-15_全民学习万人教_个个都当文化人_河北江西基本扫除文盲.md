Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, October 14th: Jiangxi Province has basically eliminated illiteracy. As of early October, over 6,747,000 people throughout the province had shed their illiterate status, reaching 91.17% of the total number of young and middle-aged people.

In the unprecedented upsurge of eliminating illiteracy, all 147 cities and counties in Hebei Province have basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy. The proportion of non-illiterate young and middle-aged people has risen from 20% before liberation to 85.5%. Among them, over 40 cities and counties such as Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Ningjin, Dingxing, and Zhengding have reached over 95% non-illiteracy. The number of illiterates eliminated in the past nine months of this year is equivalent to twice the total number of illiterates eliminated in the past eight years. After literacy studies, generally, graduates of literacy classes can recognize 1,500 to 2,500 characters, can read popular newspapers and write short essays of 300 to 500 characters. Therefore, a new situation has emerged: "Two thousand years of illiteracy swept away today, ten thousand people all become cultured individuals."

The reason why this year's literacy campaign has progressed so rapidly and achieved such great results is primarily due to the strengthened leadership of Party committees at all levels. Party committees at all levels generally adopted the method of "secretaries taking command, the whole Party acting, and the whole people mobilizing" to lead mass movements, made overall arrangements for literacy and production, conducted regular research and inspections, and assigned special personnel to manage the work, so that learning and production were closely integrated. Township and commune leaders generally achieved "dual management" (managing both production and learning), and all departments closely cooperated and promptly resolved specific problems in the literacy campaign, ensuring that learning followed production, so that wherever there was production, there was learning.

Secondly, the masses were fully mobilized and relied upon. At the beginning of the movement, Party committees at all levels grasped ideological leadership, raised awareness through debate, presented facts, and reasoned, so that the broad masses realized that eliminating illiteracy was not only solving the problems of the masses' daily life, but also necessary for carrying out the technological revolution, developing production, and accelerating socialist construction, thereby enhancing the enthusiasm and consciousness of the whole people for eliminating illiteracy. The province had more than 4 million voluntary teachers participating in teaching, and the masses also showed astonishing perseverance in their hard study. For example, in Xiegou Village in Xingtai County, originally no one in the village could read. After they adopted the method of "Tang Monk's pilgrimage" (sending people to learn in other villages) and teaching while learning, they also eliminated illiteracy.

Thirdly, along with the Great Leap Forward in production and the liberation of thought, a series of teaching reforms were carried out. Regardless of factories, mines, rural areas, or streets, literacy textbooks were compiled and selected according to their own needs, and "three-in-one" schools combining politics, culture, and technology, Red and Expert schools, and part-work, part-study schools for training the working class intellectuals were also established. In addition, based on production needs and the students' ability to learn, a literacy teaching method of "teaching according to individual aptitude" was adopted, which greatly accelerated the teaching progress.

After the completion of literacy classes, the province immediately launched a "Read a Hundred Books, Write a Thousand Essays" review movement, and they then transferred to various types of spare-time schools to continue their studies. At present, more than 2.4 million people have transferred to various types of spare-time primary schools, nearly 400,000 people have participated in Red and Expert school studies, more than 200,000 people have participated in spare-time junior and senior high school studies, and more than 800,000 people have participated in Red and Expert university studies. At present, the province has established a network of worker-peasant education and a worker-peasant education system from primary school to university, so as to effectively improve the political and cultural level of the working people and better serve the development of production.

In the literacy campaign in Jiangxi, the principle of putting politics in command and following the mass line has always been implemented. Extensive publicity activities were carried out throughout the province, repeated debates were held, confidence in learning was established, and a wave of "national learning, ten thousand people teaching" was formed. In the literacy campaign, generally, six followings and six goings were achieved, that is, learning followed production; content followed reality; classrooms followed production sites; learning forms followed production forms; books followed people; teachers followed students. Production and literacy promotion were combined and promoted each other. Now, the illiteracy rate among farmers in the province has been reduced from 83.1% in the early days of liberation to 8.94%, and the illiteracy rate among workers has been reduced from 71% to 6.9%. Rural work cadres are now all cultured, able to read and write.

With the improvement of the masses' cultural level, the political and cultural life in rural areas has also been further enlivened. Now, in every village in Jiangxi Province, propaganda posters, big-character posters, and wall paintings are everywhere, and fields and hillsides are often filled with the laughter of reading, reading newspapers, and singing. After eliminating illiteracy, various places are now advancing victoriously, vigorously carrying out improvement and consolidation, and the action slogan put forward by the masses is: "Don't dismount, whip hard, completely occupy the cultural mountain, make persistent efforts and work hard again, and transfer to spare-time primary, spare-time secondary, and technical classes as soon as possible."

    全民学习万人教　个个都当文化人
    河北江西基本扫除文盲
    本报讯　在空前未有的扫盲高潮中，河北全省一百四十七个市县，都基本完成了扫盲任务。青壮年中的非文盲比例由解放前的20％上升到85.5％。其中石家庄、唐山、秦皇岛和宁津、定兴、正定等四十多个县市非文盲已达到95％以上。今年九个月来扫除的文盲，相当于过去八年来扫除文盲总数的两倍。经过识字学习，一般扫盲结业学员都能认识一千五到两千五百个生字，能阅读通俗书报和写三、五百字的短文。因而，出现了“二千载文盲今日扫，万众皆成文化人”的新局面。
    今年的扫盲运动，所以进展很快，成绩很大，首先是由于各级党委加强了领导。各级党委一般都采取了“书记挂帅，全党动手，全民动员”领导群众运动的方法，将扫盲和生产进行了统筹安排，定期研究检查，并确定专人分工管理，使学习和生产取得紧密结合。乡社领导一般也做到“双管”（既管生产，又管学习），各部门也做到了密切配合，及时解决扫盲运动中的具体问题，使学习跟着生产走，做到哪里有生产，哪里有学习。
    其次，是充分的发动群众，依靠群众。运动一开始，各级党委就抓紧了思想领导，通过鸣放辩论，摆事实讲道理，使广大群众认识到扫除文盲不但是解决群众日常生活上的问题，而且是进行技术革命，发展生产，加速社会主义建设所必需的，从而提高了全民扫盲的积极性和自觉性。全省参加教学的义务教师共达四百余万人，群众也表现了惊人的刻苦学习的毅力。如邢台县谢沟村，原来全村没有一个识字的人，他们采取了“唐僧取经”（派人到外村学）和边教边学的办法后，也扫除了文盲。
    再次，是随着生产的大跃进，思想的解放，进行了一系列的教学改革。无论厂矿、农村、街道，都根据自己的需要，编选了识字教材，还创办了政治、文化、技术相结合的“三合一”学校、红专学校和培养工人阶级知识分子的半工半读学校。另外，还根据生产需要和学员的接受能力，采取了“因人施教”的识字教学法，从而大大地加快了教学进度。
    在扫盲结业之后，全省立即开展了一个“读百本书，写千篇文”的复习运动，他们随即转入各种类型的业余学校，继续参加学习。目前，转入各类业余小学学习的有二百四十多万人，参加红专学校学习的近四十万人，参加业余初、高中学习的有二十多万人，参加红专大学学习的有八十多万人。目前，全省已建立起了一支工农教育网，和从小学到大学的工农教育体系，以便有效地提高劳动人民的政治、文化水平，更好地为发展生产服务。
              （河北省教育厅）
    新华社南昌14日电　江西省已经基本扫除了文盲。到10月上旬止，全省已有六百七十四万七千余人脱离了文盲状态，达到青壮年总数的91.17％。
    江西在扫盲运动中，始终贯彻了政治挂帅和群众路线。全省广泛展开宣传活动，反复辩论，树立学习信心，形成了“全民学、万人教”的热潮。在扫盲运动中，一般做到了六跟六走，即学习跟生产走；内容跟实际走；课堂跟生产场所走；学习形式跟生产形式走；书本跟人走；教师跟学员走。生产和扫盲互相结合，互相推动。现在，全省农民中的文盲已由解放初期的83.1％降低到8.94％，职工中的文盲已由71％降低到6.9％。农村工作干部已经是人人有文化，人人能读能写了。
    随着群众文化水平的提高，也进一步活跃了农村的政治生活和文化生活。现在在江西省的每个村落，宣传牌、大字报、墙头画到处皆是，田间、山坡经常出现一片读书、念报、唱歌的欢笑声。各地在扫除文盲以后，目前正在乘胜前进，大力进行提高巩固，群众提出的行动口号是：“不下马，猛加鞭，彻底占领文化山，再接再厉再苦战，尽快转上业小、业中、技术班。”
