Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 27th. Responsible persons from various democratic parties and former Kuomintang military and government personnel in Guangzhou held a discussion on the "Letter to Taiwan Compatriots" issued by our Ministry of National Defense on the 26th, urging Taiwan military and government personnel not to be swayed by others and to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Participants in the symposium also unanimously condemned Dulles' conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

The meeting was presided over by Li Langru, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This old man, who served as Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard more than 40 years ago, advised Kuomintang friends in Taiwan to make a decisive decision and not to continue to be led by the nose by the Americans, so as to avoid ending up in a sad situation.

He Baosong, Standing Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), pointed out that the announcement issued by Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles during their talks further exposed the US imperialist conspiracy to create "two Chinas." If some people in Taiwan still harbored illusions about the United States in the past, believing that they could survive under the protection of the Americans, then they should now wake up. There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan compatriots should unite with the people of the motherland to jointly smash the US imperialist conspiracy. Liang Shiji, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Office of Councillors and Deputy Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China National Democratic League, pointed out: Minister Peng Dehuai's righteous "Letter to Taiwan Compatriots" is another powerful blow to the US imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas." This former Lieutenant General Chief of Staff of the Seventh War Zone of the Kuomintang repeatedly advised Taiwan military and government personnel to understand the times, prioritize national interests, abandon the dark and turn to the light, and perform meritorious service for the motherland. Do not rely on the American iceberg as a backer, isolate themselves from the motherland and the people, and eventually end up with nowhere to stand.

Wu Juetian, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, believes that Taiwan's military and government personnel should be good at learning lessons from historical facts. The assassination of Zhang Zuolin by Japanese imperialists is an example. US imperialism will not hesitate to use any vicious conspiracy for its own interests. The only way out for Taiwan's military and government personnel today is to rely on the motherland. All patriots can be welcomed by the people of the motherland. Zeng Huiqi, Standing Committee member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the RCCK, is a general who revolted. He said: Taiwan's military and government personnel and compatriots should understand the great national righteousness, unite with the mainland compatriots, and jointly deal with US imperialism. Ye Peihua, head of the Guangzhou branch of the Jiusan Society, said that if Taiwan's military and government personnel are loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they should follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, prioritize national righteousness, turn enemies into friends, and get out in time, and not fall into Dulles' trap again.

    广州各民主党派人士和前国民党军政人员
    规劝台湾军政人员明察时务勿自绝于祖国
    新华社广州27日电　在广州的各民主党派负责人和前国民党军政人员，26日座谈我国防部再告台湾同胞书，规劝台湾军政人员不要随人俯仰，及早回到祖国怀抱。参加座谈的人员还一致斥责杜勒斯制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    会议由政协广东省委员会副主席李朗如主持。这位曾在四十多年前做过孙中山先生侍卫长的老人忠告台湾国民党的朋友，应该当机立断，不要继续让美国人牵着鼻子走，以免最后落得可悲境地。
    民革广东省委常务委员何宝松指出，蒋介石和杜勒斯这次会谈发表的公告，进一步暴露了美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋，如果说，过去台湾还有一些人仍然对美国抱着幻想，认为可以在美国人的庇护下残存苟活，那末，现在他们也应觉醒过来了，世界上只有一个中国，台湾同胞应和祖国人民一道，共同粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。广东省参事室副主任、农工民主党广东省委副主任委员梁世骥指出：彭德怀部长这篇义正词严的再告台湾同胞书，是给美帝国主义者制造“两个中国”的阴谋的又一次有力的打击。这位前国民党第七战区中将参谋长一再忠告台湾军政人员：要明察时务，以民族利益为重，弃暗投明，为祖国立功，不要依美国冰山作靠山，自绝于祖国，自绝于人民，以至最后走到无存身之地。
    致公党广东省委副主委伍觉天认为，台湾的军政人员应该善于从历史事实中吸取教训，日本帝国主义者杀害张作霖就是一个例子，美帝国主义为了本身的利益，是不惜耍弄任何毒辣的阴谋诡计的。台湾的军政人员今天唯一的出路就是投靠祖国，一切爱国的人都可以得到祖国人民的欢迎。民革广东省委常务委员曾会奇是起义将领，他说：台湾军政人员和同胞们应明白民族大义，和大陆同胞团结起来，共同对付美帝国主义。九三学社广州分社负责人叶佩华说，台湾军政人员如果是忠于孙中山先生的话，就应该遵循孙中山先生的教导，以民族大义为重，化敌为友，及时自拔，不要再陷入杜勒斯的陷阱中。
