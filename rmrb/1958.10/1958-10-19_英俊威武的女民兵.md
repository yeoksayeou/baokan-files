    Heroic and Valiant Female Militia
    "One, two, one; one, two, three, four."
    Every morning, on the training grounds of the mountain villages in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, 20,000 heroic female militiamen are drilling. With wooden pistols in their belts and rifles on their shoulders, they present a truly impressive sight.
    On September 13th, the Dong ethnic militia of the Linxi Satellite People's Commune held a grand parade and competition. The Chengyang Brigade sent twenty people to participate. After inspecting the troops, the commander said, "People say that Dong girls are timid and dare not even touch a cow. It seems to be true. There isn't a single female militiaman." The Party Branch Secretary restrained his laughter and said, "Let's talk about it after the competition."
    The heroic and valiant Chengyang militiamen stepped onto the training ground. All kinds of marching, basic movements such as sitting, standing, lying down, and shooting were proficient and accurate, earning them the first place in the entire commune. Militiamen from various places surrounded the Chengyang militiamen, asking them to share their experience. Ah, everyone cried out in unison, pointing at a heroic militiaman, "Isn't that the female militia captain, Yang Wenying?" Upon closer inspection, it was true. Besides her, there were six other female militiamen, all dressed as men. The extraordinary story of women dressing as men spread throughout the mountain villages.
    It turned out that when American imperialism carried out military provocations against our country, everyone in the Dong ethnic group was eager to take up arms. Dong girl Yang Wenying was the first to demand to take up a gun, saying: If men can be militiamen, so can women. She began to learn marching with the men, practicing in the morning and evening. During labor breaks, she would practice aiming at birds in the mountains. Her eyes were red and swollen from the wind and sand, but she would rub them and continue practicing. One day, live ammunition shooting was to be held. After the commander's demonstration, Yang Wenying fired the first shot, achieving excellent results. Seeing Yang Wenying's enthusiasm, the girls all asked to become glorious militiamen. From then on, the Chengyang Brigade formed a female militia team, training just like the men. They excelled in training, production, and cultural studies, surpassing the men's team in every aspect. Hearing about the upcoming parade and competition, the girls selected seven people. They couldn't let the girls down! They decided to dress as men, taking off their earrings and bracelets, and tying up their hair in men's headscarves, to participate in the competition and show everyone that women can fight on the battlefield alongside men.

    英俊威武的女民兵
    “一二一，一二三四。”
    每天清晨，三江侗族自治县山寨的操练场上，有两万名雄赳赳的女民兵在操练。她们腰里插着木手枪，肩上扛的是步枪，好一副威武气概。
    9月13日，林溪卫星人民公社侗族民兵举行盛大阅兵比赛，程阳大队选派了二十人来参加。指挥员巡视以后说道：“人都说侗家姑娘胆子小，连牛也不敢摸一摸，果真不假，一个女民兵都没有。”党支书忍住了笑，他说：“等比赛完再谈。”
    英俊、威武的程阳民兵登上了操练场，各种步伐，坐、立、卧、射等基本动作，样样纯熟、准确，被评为全公社第一名。各地民兵把程阳民兵包围起来，要求介绍经验。呀，大家不约而同地向一个威武的民兵惊叫起来，“那不是女民兵队长杨文英吗？”凑近一认，果然，除了她还有六名女民兵，全是男子装束。女扮男装的奇闻传遍了山寨。
    原来是这样：当美帝国主义对我国进行军事挑衅时，侗族人人磨拳擦掌，要求武装起来。侗家姑娘杨文英第一个要求拿起枪杆，她说：男子能当民兵，女子也能。她开始和男子一起学步法，早晚学操练，劳动休息时，在山上碰到飞鸟就学瞄准，眼睛被风沙吹得红肿，用手揉揉又练习。一天，要举行实弹射击了，经过指挥员示范之后，杨文英打出第一枪，成绩优秀。姑娘们看到杨文英的那股劲，都要求当一个光荣的民兵。从此，程阳大队编成女子民兵队，和男子一样操练。她们操练、生产、学文化样样都比男子队好。听说要检阅比赛，姑娘们选出了七个人。不能给姑娘们丢人啊！她们决定女扮男装，摘下了耳环、手镯，打起男人头巾，去参加比赛，让大家看看女子是不是能和男子一起上战场。
