    Seize the Time Before the Freeze to Plow the Autumn Stubble Fields
    The Three Northeastern Provinces Resolutely Implement the "Constitution" of Agriculture
    Strive to Double Grain Production by Next Year
    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 27th dispatch) The important instructions on agricultural production in the three northeastern provinces made by Comrades Deng Xiaoping and other central and state leaders during their inspection of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have had a tremendous impact on the millions of farmers in the three northeastern provinces. At present, the farmers of the three provinces are racing against the severe cold and freezing at a rate of more than five million mu of deep plowing per day.
    In the vast fields of Northeast China, there are scenes of massive activity during the day, and lanterns and torches at night, working hard through the night. A large number of skilled craftsmen have been concentrated in various places, working day and night to manufacture rope traction machines to speed up the progress of deep plowing. In Heilongjiang Province, many counties now have an average of one rope traction plow for every 150 mu of land. In addition to this, tractors, animal-drawn plows, hand-pulled plows, and digging shovels are all being used. Urban residents are also fully supporting agricultural production. Most county-level agencies only leave a few people on duty, and cadres sent to the countryside not only work in the fields but also plow the land with the farmers. Even in industrial cities like Shenyang, where steel and other production tasks are very tight, 80,000 people are organized into companies and sent to eleven counties (cities) for a 20-day campaign to help farmers plow the land. More than 100,000 workers, students, and troops in Harbin city braved the rain last Sunday to participate in voluntary labor, helping the rural areas in the suburbs to deep plow 36,000 mu of land in one day.
    The northeast region is already experiencing the equivalent of winter in the south. In Heilongjiang Province, the minimum temperature at night has dropped to minus ten degrees Celsius. The land in the three provinces will soon freeze, and efforts are currently being made to accelerate the pace and complete the deep plowing task before the freezing period. The current daily progress of land plowing in Liaoning Province is more than one million mu; Jilin Province is at two million four hundred thousand mu. In Heilongjiang Province, which has the least labor force and the most cultivated land among the three provinces, the current daily deep plowing reaches more than two million five hundred thousand mu. The total area of planned cultivated land for next year in the province has already been deeply plowed by 67.3%, and four counties, including Nehe and Boli, have completed the deep plowing task before the 23rd.
    Agricultural production in the three northeastern provinces this year has made great progress compared with the past. The increase in production in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces is 30% to 52%, respectively. However, compared with the situation in the provinces inside the customs, where agricultural production has doubled or even increased several times, they have not been completely turned over. According to the experience and lessons summarized by various localities, it is necessary to fully implement Chairman Mao's "Constitution" of agricultural production, which includes "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, density, pest control, tools, and management," in order to thoroughly transform agriculture. In order to ensure that the grain output of the three northeastern provinces will at least double next year compared to this year, all localities will first focus on the two important aspects of soil and water, which are relatively weak in this year's implementation of the "Constitution" of agriculture. First, seize the opportunity to deeply plow the land, so that the cultivated land is generally deeply plowed more than one foot. Improve and promote the experience of winter water conservancy construction and utilize the winter to carry out large-scale water conservancy projects. At the same time, concentrate on accumulating fertilizer and preparing sufficient good seeds needed for dense planting.
    As a major revolutionary measure in agricultural production policy, Heilongjiang Province will reduce its cultivated land area by one-sixth next year compared to this year, that is, reducing the sown area by more than 16 million mu, changing from extensive cultivation and low yield to intensive cultivation and meticulous work. Some counties and people's communes have begun to consider making the existing cultivated land account for one-third each for grain production, leisure, and tree planting, implementing the agricultural production policy of "planting less, planting well, and harvesting more."
    Party and government leaders at all levels in the three provinces analyzed the past incomplete implementation of the "Constitution" of agricultural production in the three northeastern provinces, mainly because their minds had not been completely liberated, and the influence of "theory of conditions" and "theory of habit" had not been completely eliminated. Therefore, in the current high tide of deep plowing, they are universally mobilizing rural cadres and the masses to study and discuss Comrade Xiaoping's instructions in the fields, conduct debates on the thorough transformation of agricultural production, mobilize the masses through debates, and promote a thorough revolution in agriculture.

### 抢在封冻前翻完秋茬地  东北三省坚决执行农业“宪法”  力争明年粮食产量至少翻一番

    抢在封冻前翻完秋茬地
    东北三省坚决执行农业“宪法”
    力争明年粮食产量至少翻一番
    本报哈尔滨27日电　中共中央和国家领导人邓小平等同志视察辽宁、吉林、黑龙江时，对东北三省农业生产所作的重要指示，在东北三省千百万农民中已产生巨大影响。目前三省农民正以每天深翻地五百多万亩的进度和严寒冰冻赛跑。
    在东北地区广阔的田野上，白天到处都是千军万马，夜晚是灯笼火把，连夜苦战。各地集中了大批的能工巧匠，昼夜不停制造绳索牵引机，以加快深翻地的进度。黑龙江省已有好多县，平均每一百五十亩地就有一台绳索牵引犁。除此以外，拖拉机、畜力犁、人拉犁、翻地的铁锹等都一齐上阵。城镇居民也全力支援农业生产。大部分县城机关只留几个人驻守，下乡干部不仅是田头办公而且和农民一起翻地。即便是沈阳这样的工业城市，钢铁等生产任务十分紧张，仍然有八万人编成连队，分赴十一个县（市），大战二十天，帮助农民翻地。哈尔滨市区十万多职工、学生、驻军，上星期天冒雨到郊区参加义务劳动，一天帮郊区农村深翻地三万六千亩。
    东北地区已经相当于南方的严冬，在黑龙江省最低气温夜间已经降到零下十度，三省土地很快就要封冻，目前正力争高速度，抢在封冻期前完成深翻地任务。辽宁省现在翻地的日进度是一百万亩以上；吉林省二百四十万亩；三省中劳动力少耕地最多的黑龙江省农村，目前每天深翻地达二百五十多万亩，全省计划明年耕地的总面积，已经深翻67.3％，并已有讷河、勃利等四个县在23日前完成深翻任务。
    东北三省今年农业生产都比过去大大前进了一步，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省增产幅度，分别为30％到52％。但和关内各省农业增产一倍以至几倍以上的情况相比，还没有彻底翻身。根据各地总结经验、教训，必须全面执行毛主席所指示的“水、肥、土、种、密、害、工、管”这个农业生产“宪法”，才能使农业得到彻底翻身。为了使明年东北三省粮食产量至少要比今年翻一番，各地首先抓今年执行农业“宪法”中比较薄弱的土和水两个重要环节。先抢深翻地，使耕地普遍深翻一尺以上；改进和推广去冬水利施工经验，利用冬季大干水利；同时抓紧积肥和准备好足够密植需要的良种。
    作为农业生产方针重大革命性的措施，黑龙江省明年耕地面积比今年要缩减六分之一，即减少播种面积一千六百多万亩，变广种薄收为精耕细作。一部分县和人民公社开始酝酿，使现有耕地生产粮食、休闲、种树各占三分之一，实行“种的少，种的好，收的多”的农业生产方针。
    三省各级党、政领导人分析了过去东北三省对农业生产“宪法”执行的不全面，主要原因是思想还没有彻底解放，“唯条件论”、“习惯论”的影响还没有完全肃清。因此目前正在深翻耕地的高潮中，普遍发动农村干部和群众，在田间地头学习讨论了小平同志的指示，就农业生产的彻底翻身进行了鸣放辩论，通过鸣放辩论来发动群众，以大搞群众运动，推进农业上的彻底革命。（吴建民、李树功、高方）
