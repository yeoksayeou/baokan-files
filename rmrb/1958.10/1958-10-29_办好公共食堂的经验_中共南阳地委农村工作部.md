Experiences in Running Public Mess Halls
Rural Work Department of the CPC Nanyang Prefectural Committee

    Along with the vigorous development of people's communes and large-scale industrial and agricultural production in the Nanyang area of Henan Province, the movement for rural public mess halls has also developed rapidly. As of September 15th, the region had organized 46,397 rural public mess halls, with the participation of more than 1.3 million farming households, accounting for 93.29% of the total number of farming households. Party committees at all levels generally attach great importance to the development and consolidation of mess hall work. From the beginning of the movement, the principle of "developing while consolidating" was vigorously implemented. Currently, rectification work is being carried out through outstanding production. Therefore, more than 90% of the mess halls are well-run and satisfying to the masses, effectively promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production centered on steel and deep plowing. From this period of mess hall rectification work, the following four issues are mainly addressed:

    I. Give prominence to politics, carry out the struggle between the two roads, and mobilize the masses to conduct extensive airing of views, big debates, and further criticize capitalist ideas represented by wealthy peasants, and establish socialist ideas.

    The mess hall is a revolution in the lifestyle of peasants from individual to collective, and is the bud of communism. After the establishment of the mess hall, although the broad masses rejoiced and sang praises everywhere, some wealthy peasants with serious capitalist ideas took advantage of the fact that peasants were not yet accustomed to collective life, seized on individual shortcomings in running the mess hall, spread rumors about the mess hall, and undermined its prestige to vent their dissatisfaction with collective life. In response to the above situation, party committees at all levels led the masses to generally summarize the advantages of the mess hall. In the spirit of mass self-education, they raised questions such as "What are the benefits of the mess hall? Can it be run well? How can the mess hall be run well?" and launched airing of views and debates, allowing the masses to recognize the superiority of the public mess hall from their own experiences. The Liaoxi mess hall in Liuquanpu Township, Zhenping County, summarized fourteen major advantages in the extensive airing of views and big debates:

    (1) It can save food and reduce waste. One month after the establishment of the mess hall, it saved 528 jin of grain. (2) It saves firewood. Due to collective cooking, an average of 120 jin of firewood can be saved every day. (3) It can liberate a large number of laborers to participate in industrial and agricultural production. Before the establishment of the mess hall, cooking alone required 29 laborers in the whole team, while after the establishment of the mess hall, only seven cooks were needed. (4) After the establishment of the mess hall, the tedious housework of the commune members was reduced, everyone was in a good mood, and the attendance rate was unprecedentedly high, averaging about 50% higher than before the mess hall was established. (5) The sick, pregnant women, children, and the elderly are well taken care of. The mess hall has four small pots specially for taking care of the sick, pregnant women, children, and the elderly. (6) It enables commune members to have time to study culture. (7) Unified eating and consistent timing not only facilitate production but also make it easier to conduct propaganda and education and carry out various tasks for the commune members. (8) It fundamentally eliminates grain speculation. Before the establishment of the mess hall, some elements with serious capitalist ideas took advantage of the gaps in decentralized individual cooking to sell grain at high prices on the black market and undermine grain policies. After the establishment of the mess hall, their shameless acts could no longer succeed. (9) Regardless of the size of the mess hall, every commune member can eat their fill and eat well. (10) It further liberated women. (11) It can greatly develop collective sideline occupations and improve life. After the establishment of the mess hall, 15 pigs and 37 sheep have been raised. (12) It further strengthens the relationship between cadres and the masses. Cadres and commune members eat in the same pot, which enables them to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner, achieving unity of mind between cadres and the masses. (13) There are more people who care. The mess hall is a collective welfare organization for everyone, and the commune members are very concerned about whether it is run well or not. (14) Life is well adjusted, everyone is very satisfied, and production is particularly active.

    After summarizing the advantages of the mess hall, right and wrong were clearly distinguished. Commune members were very angry with wealthy peasants who had serious capitalist ideas and destructive activities, and they rose up to reason with them and debate with them, refuting their slanders against the mess hall. For example, Zhu Panli, a wealthy middle peasant in Hezhuang Township, Fangcheng County, often complained after joining the mess hall. He did not eat the steamed buns made in the mess hall, but instead said, "You can't eat your fill in the mess hall, and the mess hall will collapse sooner or later." Everyone presented many facts and questioned him why he spread rumors everywhere, saying "You can't eat your fill in the mess hall" when he had steamed buns. Zhu Panli was refuted and speechless, and had to admit that he had serious capitalist ideas and said that he would resolutely correct them in the future.

    II. Check the implementation of class policies, select good management personnel and cooks, resolutely eliminate impure elements, and establish a leading group with Party members and League members as the core and poor and lower-middle peasants as the absolute majority. This is an important link in running the mess hall well.

    When running the mess hall, a few cadres were ideologically paralyzed and lost their class vigilance, resulting in a small number of impure elements mixing into the mess hall, making trouble, provoking relations between cadres and the masses, squandering and wasting food, and using various despicable means to sabotage the mess hall. Ding Zhaolin, a landlord in Qiaotou Commune, Nanyang County, took water from a muddy pit and used it to cook in the mess hall, resulting in rice that was so stinky that it could not be eaten, and the commune members had many complaints. This situation cannot but arouse the attention of party committees at all levels, and they must take resolute measures to purify the mess hall organization. On the one hand, implement class policies, mobilize the masses to investigate the destructive activities of enemies in the mess hall, educate cadres and the masses with facts, recognize the nature of the enemy, let the masses carry out fierce struggles and resolutely eliminate and strike at them; on the other hand, select socialist activists from poor and lower-middle peasants to participate in the leadership and management of the mess hall. According to the understanding of 19,455 mess halls in six counties, including Fangcheng, Nanyang, Dengxian, Zhenping, Tongbai, and Tanghe, 539 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements and rightists, and 2,769 wealthy peasants with serious capitalist ideas were eliminated from the mess hall management personnel; 1,009 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements and rightists, and 7,539 wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas were eliminated from the cooks. At the same time, a large number of outstanding activists from poor and lower-middle peasants were absorbed to participate in the leadership, and the proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants in the management personnel and cooks increased rapidly. The proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants in the management personnel jumped from 76% before the rectification to 86%; the proportion of poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooks also increased from 77% before the rectification to 89%. This guarantees the consolidation of the mess hall politically and organizationally.

    III. Rely on the masses, implement the principle of diligence and thrift, improve operation and management, save food and firewood, and ensure that the commune members eat their fill and eat well.

    (1) Mobilize the masses to vigorously collect wild vegetables, accumulate dried vegetables, and plant vegetables to solve the supply of non-staple foods. This is the key to adjusting life well and saving food. At present, there are roughly three ways to solve the supply of non-staple foods in various places: the mess hall purchases the existing dried vegetables and green vegetables from the private plots of the commune members at reasonable prices; organizes children or auxiliary labor to collect and store a large number of wild vegetables; the mess hall unifies the management of the commune members' private plots and plants a large number of vegetables. The third method is the fundamental way to solve the supply of non-staple foods.

    (2) Improve stoves and try every possible means to save firewood. After running the mess hall, the masses in various places have made many innovations and inventions in improving stoves and saving firewood. The masses in Laozhuang Township, Zhenping County, pooled their wisdom and improved the old stoves into "high-platform trapezoidal continuous stoves," which only require about 15 liang of firewood per person per day; the Shimiao mess hall in Shimen Commune, Nanzhao County, improved the stoves into "A-shaped" stoves, saving about 50% of firewood. In Hezhuang Township, Fangcheng County, each team regularly plans for two to three commune members to collect firewood. At present, in addition to firewood, each of the 80 mess halls in the township has generally stored more than 5,000 jin of firewood, which is enough for more than half a month.

    In addition, the Liaohe and other communes in Nanyang are striving to achieve biogasification, using biogas for cooking, lighting, and operating machines, which will not only fundamentally solve the fuel problem, but also create greater welfare for the commune members.

    (3) Improve management methods, improve cooking skills, save food, and ensure that the commune members eat their fill and eat well. In the early days of running the mess hall, due to the lack of management experience, some cooks had the simple and easy idea of being afraid of trouble. Many mess halls only ate steamed buns and drank boiled water, without stir-frying vegetables or making porridge, so the commune members did not eat well, and the meal time was long, which affected production. In controlling food, some people distributed steamed buns according to the number of people, resulting in overspending of food. For this situation, the general improvement methods in various places are: (1) Strengthen the ideological leadership of cooks, establish a clear view of serving the commune members and supporting production, improve and improve skills, diversify life adjustment, so that the commune members can eat their fill and eat well. (2) Implement "knowing about meals early," the mess hall announces the menu in advance, and the commune members report the amount of food needed in advance, and the mess hall prepares meals according to the plan. (3) Each household fixes the location of the tableware, writes their name on it, and puts it in the mess hall. After the meals are cooked, the cooks prepare the meals for each household according to the plan. (4) Two methods are adopted for food control: one is to issue meal tickets to each household according to the fixed amount per person, and the commune members control the adjustment themselves. If there is a surplus this month, it can continue to be used next month. Commune members with large appetites are taken care of in terms of non-staple foods; the second is to concentrate control of the mess hall and supply food freely within the scope of ensuring that the food quota is not exceeded. Commune members are not subject to quantitative restrictions. Both methods can encourage the enthusiasm of commune members to save food, and all mess halls that do this have food surpluses.

    IV. Establish and improve leadership organizations, follow the mass line, organize on-site visits, and carry out evaluation and competition activities.

    (1) In terms of guiding ideology, party committees at all levels generally regard the rectification of mess halls as one of the important contents of consolidating the commune, and designate a special person to be responsible: the township (commune) has a secretary, deputy secretary, or party committee member responsible; the brigade and team are mainly the branch deputy secretary or deputy captain, absorbing young people, women, and progressive old farmers to participate, forming a commune member life committee (generally five to seven people); each commune member of about ten households elects a representative to form a commune member representative assembly, which holds regular meetings, listens to commune member opinions, studies and improves life, and democratically formulates various covenants and systems.

    (2) Organize on-site visits, exchange experiences; carry out evaluation and competition between communes, units, and people to comprehensively consolidate the mess hall.

    1. Grasp the advanced, summarize experience, organize on-site visits, and promote the balanced development of overall work. This point is given more prominence in various places, and advanced models are discovered and quickly summarized and promoted.

    2. Use the method of competition to promote the running of mess halls by the whole people, creating an atmosphere among the masses of "everyone contributing ideas and everyone offering suggestions" and trying every possible means to run the mess hall well. Hezhuang Township, Fangcheng County, carried out a competition movement among the mess halls based on the conditions of good life adjustment, good care for the elderly, children, and the sick, and good hygiene and cleanliness. Twenty-three mess halls in the township had red flags inserted during the first evaluation, and six mess halls had black flags inserted. After the evaluation, the whole township quickly formed a high tide of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced in running the mess hall well. In the ten mess halls of the original First Brigade, two had black flags inserted during the first evaluation. Cadres and the masses took this as a warning and actively tried to improve management. By the time of the second evaluation, both mess halls had red flags inserted. Because the mess halls were run well, showing their superiority, the middle peasants who had shaken their minds also changed their attitudes. Guo Fulin, a middle peasant commune member, said, "No matter what, I will not leave the mess hall now." In addition, some mess halls took caring for the mess hall as the main condition and carried out evaluation and competition between commune members, which played a good role in promoting commune members to care for the mess hall and think of ways to run the mess hall well.

    After this period of rectification work, the mess hall has made a great leap forward in consolidation, but there are still some problems at present, mainly: (1) A small number of leading cadres still do not pay enough attention to the work of consolidating the mess hall, do not realize that doing a good job in the mess hall is one of the important tasks of consolidating the commune, and think that organizing is "all right." Therefore, the development of the movement is unbalanced, and about 8% of the mess halls in the region are not consolidated enough. (2) The paralysis of some leading cadres has not been completely overcome. At present, there are still individual impure elements among the management personnel and cooks in individual mess halls, which must be resolutely eliminated. (3) After the implementation of the grain supply system, some people with capitalist ideas took the opportunity to eat and drink, and individual mess halls have already broken through the grain quota. (4) A small number of communes and teams lack draught animals, and it is difficult for commune members to eat noodles, which affects production.

    办好公共食堂的经验
    中共南阳地委农村工作部
    河南南阳地区在大办人民公社、大搞工农业生产的同时，农村公共食堂运动也迅速发展起来了。截至9月15日统计，全区已组织农村公共食堂四万六千三百九十七个，参加农户一百三十多万户，占总农户的93.29％。各级党委对发展与巩固食堂工作一般都很重视。运动开始就大力贯彻了“边发展，边巩固”的方针，目前又通过生产突出的抓整顿工作。因此90％以上的食堂都办的很好，群众满意，有力地推动了以钢铁和深翻土地为中心的工农业生产运动的发展。从这段整顿食堂工作来看，主要是抓住以下四个问题：
    一、政治挂帅，开展两条道路的斗争，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，进一步批判以富裕农民为代表的资本主义思想，树立社会主义思想。
    食堂是对农民的生活方式由个体转为集体的一次革命，是共产主义的萌芽。建立食堂后，虽然广大群众欢欣鼓舞，到处歌颂，但是有部分资本主义思想严重的富裕农民，却利用农民对集体生活还不够习惯的心理，抓住办食堂中的个别缺点，乱说食堂的坏话，破坏食堂的威信，以发泄自己对集体生活的不满情绪。针对上述情况，各级党委领导群众普遍总结了食堂的优越性，以群众自我教育的精神，提出“食堂有那些好处，能不能办好，怎样才能把食堂办好”等问题，开展鸣放辩论，让群众从亲身体会中认识公共食堂的优越性。镇平县柳泉铺乡潦西食堂，群众在大鸣大放中给它总结了十四大优越性：
      （一）能节省粮食，减少浪费。食堂建立后，一个月即节余粮食五百二十八斤。（二）节约烧柴。由于集体烧饭，每天平均能节约烧柴一百二十斤。（三）能解放大批劳力，参加工农业生产。办食堂前，全队仅做饭即需占劳力二十九人，而办食堂后只需七个炊事员就行了。（四）食堂成立后，减少了社员繁琐的家务劳动，人人心情舒畅，出勤率空前提高，比办食堂前出勤率平均提高50％左右。（五）对病人、孕妇、儿童和老人照顾的好。食堂设四个小锅，专门照顾病人、孕妇、儿童和老人等。（六）能使社员有时间学习文化。（七）吃饭统一，时间一致，不仅有利于生产，而且更便于对社员进行宣传教育和开展各项工作。（八）从根本上杜绝了粮食投机。办食堂前一些资本主义思想严重的分子，乘分散个体作饭的缺口，高价黑市出售粮食，破坏粮食政策。成立食堂后，他们的这种无耻勾当，就再也不能得逞了。（九）不论食堂大小，每个社员都能吃得饱、吃得好。（十）进一步解放了妇女。（十一）能大量发展集体副业，改善生活。食堂建立后已养猪十五头，羊三十七只。（十二）进一步密切了干群关系。干部、社员在一个锅内吃饭，能够及时了解情况，解决问题，达到干群一条心。（十三）操心的人多。食堂是大家的集体福利组织，办的好坏社员都非常关心。（十四）生活调剂的好，大家都很满意，生产格外积极。
    经过总结食堂的优越性后，大是大非划清了。社员对资本主义思想严重并有破坏活动的富裕农民非常愤恨，群起向他们进行说理辩论，驳斥他们对食堂的诬蔑。如方城县和庄乡富裕中农朱盘礼，参加食堂后，经常牢骚不满，不吃食堂蒸的馍，反而说“入食堂吃不饱，食堂迟早要垮台。”大家摆出许多事实，一致质问他为什么有馍不吃却到处造谣，说“食堂吃不饱”。朱盘礼被驳得理屈词穷，无言答对，只得承认自己有严重的资本主义思想，并表示今后要坚决改正。
    二、检查阶级政策执行情况，挑选好管理人员和炊事员，坚决清除不纯分子，树立以党团员为核心、贫农和下中农占绝对优势的领导集团，这是办好食堂的重要环节。
    举办食堂时，少数干部思想麻痹，丧失了阶级警惕性，致有少数不纯分子混入食堂，弄是生非，挑拨干群关系，挥霍浪费粮食，用各种卑鄙手段破坏食堂。南阳县桥头公社地主丁照林担污泥坑中的水，让食堂作饭，结果饭臭的不能吃，社员很有意见。这种情况不能不引起各级党委的重视，采取坚决措施，纯洁食堂组织。一方面贯彻阶级政策，发动群众查敌人在食堂中的破坏活动，以事实教育干部和群众，从本质上认识敌人的面貌，让群众狠狠的进行斗争，坚决的进行清除和打击；另一方面从贫农和下中农中选拔社会主义积极分子参加食堂的领导和管理。据方城、南阳、邓县、镇平、桐柏和唐河等六个县一万九千四百五十五个食堂的了解，食堂管理人员中共清除地、富、反、坏和右派分子五百三十九人，有严重资本主义思想的富裕农民二千七百六十九人；从炊事员中共清除地、富、反、坏和右派分子一千零九人，有严重资本主义思想的富裕中农七千五百三十九人。同时大量地吸收了优秀的贫农和下中农的积极分子参加领导，管理人员和炊事员中的贫农和下中农成份迅速增加。管理人员中的贫农和下中农由整顿前的76％一跃而上升为86％；炊事员中的贫农和下中农也由整顿前的77％上升为89％。从而在政治上、组织上保证了食堂的巩固。
    三、依靠群众，贯彻勤俭方针，改进经营管理，节约粮食、烧柴，使社员吃的饱吃的好。
    （1）发动群众大力采野菜，积干菜，种蔬菜，解决副食品的供应问题，这是能否调剂好生活、节约粮食的关键。目前各地解决副食品供应的办法大体有三种：食堂以合理价格收购社员家中现存的干菜和原自留地的青菜；组织小孩或辅助劳力大量采野菜积存起来；食堂统一经营社员自留地，大量种植蔬菜。其中第三种办法是解决副食品的根本办法。
    （2）改良锅灶，千方百计的节约烧柴。举办食堂后，在改良锅灶、节约烧柴方面，各地群众有很多创造发明。镇平老庄乡集中群众智慧，将旧锅灶改良为
  “高台梯形连锅灶”，每人每天只需烧柴十五两左右；南召县石门公社石庙食堂将锅灶改良为“人字形”锅灶，节约烧柴50％左右。方城县和庄乡每个队经常规划出二至三个社员拾柴，目前全乡八十个食堂中，除烧柴外，每个食堂一般均已储存烧柴五千斤以上，足够半个多月使用。
    此外，南阳潦河等公社正在努力实现沼气化，用沼气烧饭、点灯、开机器等，这不仅能从根本上解决燃料问题，而且将为社员创造更大的福利。
      （3）改进管理方法，提高作饭技术，节约粮食，使社员吃饱吃好。初办食堂，由于缺乏管理经验，部分炊事员又存在有简单省事、怕麻烦的思想，不少食堂光吃馍喝开水，不炒菜，不做稀饭，社员吃不好，开饭时间长，影响生产。在掌握粮食上，有的按人头分馍，结果超支了粮食。对于这种情况，各地的改进办法一般是：（一）加强对炊事员的思想领导，树立为社员服务、支持生产的明确观点，改进和提高技术，把生活调剂得多样化，使社员吃饱，吃好。（二）实行“吃饭早知道”，食堂事先公布饭单，社员预报所需饭菜数量，食堂按计划准备饭菜。（三）各户将食具固定地点，写上名字，放在食堂内，饭作熟后，炊事员按计划将各户饭菜打好。（四）在粮食掌握上采取两种办法：一种是按以人定量将餐票发给各户，由社员自行掌握调剂，本月节余，下月可继续使用，对食量大的社员，在副食品上进行照顾；二是在保证不超过粮食指标的范围内，食堂集中掌握，放手供应，社员不受定量限制。这两种办法都能鼓励社员节约粮食的积极性，凡是这样作的食堂粮食都有节余。
    四、建立健全领导组织，走群众路线，组织现场参观，开展评比竞赛运动。
      （1）各级党委在指导思想上，一般都把整顿食堂作为巩固公社的重要内容之一，确定有专人负责：乡（公社）有一个书记、副书记或党委委员负责；大队和中队以支部副书记或副队长为主，吸收青年、妇女和思想进步的老农参加，组成社员生活委员会（一般为五至七人）；每十户左右的社员推选一名代表，组成社员代表大会，定期召开会议，听取社员意见，研究改进生活，民主制订各项公约和制度等。
      （2）组织现场参观，交流经验；开展社与社，单位与单位，人与人之间的评比竞赛，全面巩固食堂。
    1、抓住先进，总结经验，组织现场参观，推动全面工作平衡发展。这一点各地抓的比较突出，发现先进典型，很快总结推广。
    2、运用竞赛的方法，提倡全民办食堂，在群众中造成“人人献计、个个献策”，千方百计把食堂办好的空气。方城县和庄乡根据生活调剂的好，对老、幼、病人照顾的好和卫生清洁好等条件，在各食堂间开展了竞赛运动，全乡八十个食堂第一次评议时有二十三个食堂插了红旗，有六个食堂插了黑旗。评议后，全乡很快形成了学先进、赶先进、超先进的办好食堂高潮。原第一社十个食堂中，第一次评议时有两个插了黑旗，干群引以为训，积极想法改进管理，到第二次评议时，这两个食堂都插上了红旗。由于食堂办的好，显示了优越性，原来思想动摇的中农也转变了态度。中农社员郭福林说：“现在说啥我也不出食堂”。另外，有部分食堂以爱护食堂为主要条件，开展社员与社员间的评比竞赛，对促进社员爱护食堂，大家想办法把食堂办好，起到了良好的作用。
    经过这一段的整顿工作，食堂在巩固上虽然跃进了一大步，但当前仍存在着一些问题，主要是：（1）少部分领导干部对巩固食堂工作还重视不够，不认识搞好食堂是巩固公社的重要工作之一，认为组织起来就“万事大吉”了，因此，运动发展不平衡，全区约8％左右的食堂还不够巩固。（2）部分领导干部麻痹思想仍未彻底克服，目前在个别食堂管理人员和炊事员中仍有个别不纯分子存在，必须坚决予以清除。
  （3）实行粮食供给制后，一部分有资本主义思想的人，乘机大吃大喝，个别食堂已有突破粮食指标的现象发生。（4）少数社、队畜力缺乏，社员吃面困难，影响生产。
