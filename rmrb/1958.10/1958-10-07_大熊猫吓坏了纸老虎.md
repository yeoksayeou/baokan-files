The giant panda (named "Chi Chi") from China has received the greatest welcome in London. It was brought to England by the Austrian animal dealer Demmer, and the London Zoo bought it at a high price of 10,000 pounds. The zoo built a new stable for it, surrounded by a four-tiered grandstand. The British newspapers devoted entire pages to "Chi Chi," describing its every move in great detail. Tender bamboo leaves are shipped from overseas to England in a constant stream, as this is an indispensable food for "Chi Chi."

Demmer exchanged "Chi Chi" from the Beijing Zoo this March for precious animals from South Africa. "Chi Chi" was exhibited in the Berlin Zoo for a few weeks and received a similarly huge welcome. Demmer applied for an "import license" from the United States, wanting to take "Chi Chi" to the United States. The US State Department was greatly alarmed by this, because the giant panda originated in China, and in Dulles's view, there was no such country as the "People's Republic of China" on earth. If "Chi Chi" were exhibited in New York, wouldn't it prove that there is indeed a "People's Republic of China"? After careful consideration, the U.S. officials finally sent Demmer a reply on May 29, simply refusing. The letter read: "According to the law passed by Congress on December 17, 1950, all goods exported from Communist China—or re-exported from elsewhere, including animals—are not allowed to enter the United States of America. Therefore, we absolutely cannot give your panda an import license. Of course, you can apply again, but you will not be granted approval."

    大熊猫吓坏了纸老虎
    从中国来的大熊猫（它的名字叫“奇奇”），在伦敦受到了最大的欢迎。它是由奥地利动物商人丹墨尔带来英国的，伦敦动物园以一万英镑的高价买下。动物园为它新修了厩舍，在厩舍周围筑起了共有四级的看台。英国报纸为“奇奇”化费了整版整版的篇幅，不厌其详地描写它的一举一动。青嫩的竹叶从海外源源运来英国，因为这是“奇奇”所不可或缺的饲料。
    丹墨尔是在今年3月以南非的珍贵动物，从北京动物园把“奇奇”交换来的。“奇奇”曾在柏林动物园中展出过几个星期，同样地受到了巨大的欢迎。丹墨尔曾向美国申请“进口执照”，想把“奇奇”带到美国去。美国国务院为此大为恐慌，因为大熊猫的产地是中国，而在杜勒斯看来，地球上又没有“中华人民共和国”这样一个国家。如果“奇奇”在纽约展出，岂非证明确是有一个“中华人民共和国”吗？美国的大小官员斟酌再三，终于在5月29日给丹墨尔一封回信，干脆拒绝。这封信写道：“根据1950年12月17日国会通过的法律，凡属共产党中国出口——或者从别处转出口的货物，包括动物在内，一律不准进入美利坚合众国。为此，我们绝不能给你的熊猫以进口执照。当然，你还可以再次申请，但是你是不会获得允准的。”
