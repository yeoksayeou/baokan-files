Faced with China's Leaping Development, Western Observers Stunned, Exclaiming: "The Dragon Has Awakened!"

    This newspaper reports that the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production has caused tremendous shock in the crisis-ridden capitalist world. Although Western bourgeois figures and newspapers are still trying their best to belittle China's construction achievements and distort and slander the production figures released by China, as more and more people come to visit the new China and learn more about China's construction achievements, in the face of ironclad facts, some representative newspapers and figures have had to change their tone. They have gradually begun to acknowledge that China's construction achievements are huge and astonishing, and that these achievements have profound international significance.

    Economic Leap Forward
    Achievements are Shocking
    Faced with the miracle of China's great leap forward in production, the bourgeois newspapers of Western countries, which used to maliciously ridicule and slander China, have all lowered their heads and been stunned. They have had no choice but to admit their surprise at China's achievements. The American "Christian Science Monitor" admitted on August 12 that China's economy is developing rapidly with "great momentum." The American "Newsweek" admitted on July 14 that China had achieved "shocking achievements." Reuters reporter J. Geake also said on September 10: "China's Great Leap Forward is producing real, significant results and amazing statistics." The French weekly "French Observer" said on September 4 that all observers unanimously agree that China's industrialization efforts are "unparalleled in world history." "Observer" reporter Shirer Worth reported after a recent visit to China: "The changes in three years (in China) are very amazing. The suburbs of Beijing are no longer recognizable because many new roads, factories and buildings, and a large airport have been built. Many small cities such as Luoyang and Zhengzhou have also built many modern new factories. In the suburbs of Wuhan, large areas of land were barren in 1955, but now they have become huge industrial zones. In just one district, I saw two hundred and sixty beautiful brick houses and dormitories, where the workers of nearby factories live." The American "New York Post" exclaimed when reporting on China's Great Leap Forward on August 12: "Surely, the dragon seems to have awakened." Associated Press reporter James White pointed out on September 14 that "some Westerners are unwilling to imagine that China is strong because they have been dealing with a weak China for one hundred and fifty years." But "those days are gone."

    Catching Up with Britain in Less Than Fifteen Years - Skepticism Refuted
    When China first put forward the slogan of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years, the Western bourgeois newspapers almost unanimously expressed doubt. However, now these newspapers have to admit that China may catch up with Britain in less than fifteen years. People remember that four months ago, "The Times" arbitrarily stated: "People's China lacks all the necessary conditions to realize its plan to surpass Britain in industrial production within fifteen years." But on August 26, the British "Scotsman" published the conclusions of London experts, admitting that "by 1962, China will become one of the world's major steel-producing countries, with an annual output of 25 million tons at that time." On September 2, the British hardware industry's main publication "Hardware Trade Journal" was even more amazed at China's nationwide steelmaking campaign. This publication said: "This national practice of engaging in steel production will bring about an incredible increase in output. The original target was to produce 12 million tons of crude steel in 1962, but according to the plans announced so far, it is not difficult to produce 22 million tons in that year (China). Even as this publication goes to press, we have learned that Chinese leaders have called for doubling steel production in 1958 to reach 10.7 million tons." Other major newspapers that admitted that China may surpass Britain in industrial production in ten to fifteen years include the American "Newsweek," the British "Daily Mirror," the West German "Die Welt," and the Paris "International Tribune."

    Harvest of Agricultural Production - Unprecedented in History
    China's unprecedented harvest of agricultural production has also shocked Western countries. The American "Christian Science Monitor" published an editorial entitled "Beijing's Grain Production Challenges the West," which admitted that even if the increase figures announced by China are "half true, it will have far-reaching consequences for Communist China, for Asia, and for the whole world." The "Times" exclaimed on September 6: "Even in the days when the Western Hemisphere increased grain production the most, the annual increase in production has never reached the scale (of China's current) scale."

    Many Westerners who are relatively clear-headed and willing to adopt a friendly and realistic attitude towards the new China have expressed their admiration and praise for the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward. Some Westerners who recently visited China have objectively introduced China's construction achievements with the facts they have seen with their own eyes.

    Leap Forward Achievements Difficult to Imagine - Witnessing Confirms What Was Heard
    Francis Edward Chamberlin, chairman of the Australian Labor Party who recently traveled seven thousand miles in China, published an article in the Australian "Daily News" praising China's new construction achievements. He said: "The Chinese people are like a phoenix emerging from the ashes. In Anshan, there are now nine modern open-hearth furnaces, and in many factories in Shenyang, one now produces a modern machine tool every forty-five minutes. For the first time in history, the entire (Chinese) people have ample food." He said, "I have found the Chinese people to be kind and tolerant people, and I wish them success."

    Professor Joseph Needham of Cambridge University, after a three-month visit to China, also gave a speech in Hong Kong on August 13, admiring the new China. He said that he saw "many fundamental changes in China: people eat very well, they no longer wear ragged clothes, they dress neatly, and the standard of living is improving rapidly."

    James Muir, president of the Royal Bank of Canada, also wrote in the Canadian "Globe and Mail" in Toronto after visiting China, saying, "The growth of Chinese industry, the improvement of living standards, the modernization of all aspects, and the great impact of people's energy and human labor are difficult to describe in words." He said: "I can only say that many things have to be seen to be believed." He also said that any rational person would be greatly surprised and stunned to see that in less than ten years, achievements have been completed that had not been completed in the previous four thousand years or even the last one hundred years. He said he felt that "people (in China) do not have a sense of being ruled, there is no economic depression there, and they can travel freely everywhere...." He believes that in twenty years, China will undoubtedly become an advanced industrial power with a population of one billion.

    After visiting China, French Commercial Commissioner to Hong Kong, Glimot, also praised China's rural areas in Hong Kong for rapidly improving water conservancy and agricultural implements under the cooperative system, and for significantly increasing production. He especially mentioned China's policy of blooming industries everywhere. He believes that this policy is a bold attempt that orthodox Western experts cannot imagine.

    对着我国飞跃发展目瞪口呆
    西方观察家惊呼巨龙醒了
    本报讯　中国工农业生产的大跃进，在陷入重重危机的资本主义世界引起了巨大的震动。尽管西方资产阶级人士和报刊仍在竭力贬低我国的建设成就，对我国所公布的生产数字进行歪曲和诬蔑，但是随着前来新中国访问的人士的日益增多和他们对中国建设成就的日益了解，在铁的事实面前，一些具有代表性的报刊和人物不得不改变腔调。他们不得不逐渐开始承认中国的建设成就是巨大的、惊人的，并承认这个成就具有深刻的国际意义。
    经济飞跃发展
    成就令人震惊
    在我国生产大跃进的奇迹面前，过去一向恶毒地嘲笑和诬蔑我国的西方国家的资产阶级报刊都垂头丧气了，目瞪口呆了。它们只得无可奈何地承认对中国的成就感到惊奇。8月12日的美国“基督教科学箴言报”承认，中国的经济正以“澎湃之势”在飞速发展。7月14日的美国“新闻周刊”承认，中国已经取得了“令人震惊的成就”。英国路透社记者季杰克9月10日也说：“中国的大跃进正在产生真正的、显著的成果和惊人的统计数字。”9月4日的“法兰西观察家”周刊说，所有的观察家一致承认，中国工业化的努力是“世界史上无与伦比的”。英国“观察家报”记者希拉德沃思在最近访问中国以后，报道说：“三年中（中国）的变化是非常惊人的。北京郊区已经无法辨认了，因为建筑了许多新的公路、工厂和建筑物，以及一个大的飞机场。像洛阳、郑州这些小城市也办了许许多多现代化的新工厂。在武汉的郊区，1955年大片大片的土地还是荒芜的，而现在却成了一个巨大的工业区。仅仅在一个区里，我就看到了二百六十座漂亮的砖房和宿舍，里面住着附近工厂的工人。”美国“纽约邮报”8月12日在报道我国大跃进时便惊呼道：“肯定地，龙似乎醒了。”美联社记者詹姆斯·怀特9月14日指出“某些西方人不愿意想像中国是强大的，因为他们一百五十年来一直是同一个软弱的中国打交道。”但是，“那种日子已经过去了”。
    赶英国不需十五年　怀疑论被人驳倒
    当我国刚刚提出十五年内在重要工业品产量方面赶上英国的口号时，西方资产阶级报刊几乎异口同声地表示怀疑。但是，现在这些报刊都不得不承认我国甚至不需十五年就能赶上英国了。人们记得，四个月前，“泰晤士报”还武断地表示：“人民中国缺乏实现它要十五年内在工业生产方面超过英国的计划的一切必备条件。”但是8月26日英国“苏格兰人报”就发表了伦敦专家的结论，承认“到1962年，中国将成为世界上主要产钢国家之一，那时的年产量将是二千五百万吨。”9月2日英国五金业的主要刊物“五金业公报”更对中国的全民炼钢大为惊叹。这个刊物说：“这种全国从事钢铁生产的做法将使产量有令人难以置信的增加，原定目标是在1962年生产一千二百万吨粗钢，而按照至今为止所宣布的计划，到那一年（中国）生产二千二百万吨是不太困难的。甚至在本刊付印的时候，我们获悉中国领导人号召在1958年把钢产量翻一番，达到一千零七十万吨。”其他承认中国在十到十五年内在工业生产上可能超过英国的还有美国的“新闻周刊”，英国的“每日镜报”，西德的“世界报”以及巴黎的“国际论坛”等重要报刊。
    农业生产丰收　历史从来未有
    我国农业生产的空前丰收，也引起了西方国家的震惊。美国“基督教科学箴言报”发表题为“北京的粮食产量向西方挑战”的社论中就承认，即使中国宣布的增产数字“一半属实的话，那对于共产党中国、对于亚洲和对于全世界都将发生影响深远的后果。”9月6日的“泰晤士报”更惊呼道：“西半球即使是在谷物生产量增加最多的日子里，年产量的提高也从来没有达到过（目前中国的）那种规模。”
    许多头脑比较清醒、愿意对新中国采取友好和现实态度的西方人士，对于我国大跃进的成绩，表示了钦佩和赞叹。最近访问了中国的一些西方人士并以他们亲身见到的事实，对中国的建设成就作了客观的介绍。
    跃进成绩难想像　目睹证实了耳闻
    不久前在中国旅行了七千英里的澳大利亚工党联邦主席弗朗西斯·爱德华·张伯伦在澳大利亚“每日新闻”上发表文章，盛赞中国的新建设成就。他说：“中国人像从灰烬中出现的凤凰，在鞍山现在有九个现代化的平炉，在沈阳的许多家工厂中，有一家现在每四十五分钟便生产出一台现代化机床。全体（中国）人民历史上第一次有充裕的粮食。”他说，“我发现中国人民是厚道的、宽容的人民，我祝他们顺利。”
    英国剑桥大学的李约瑟教授在中国作了三个月的访问以后，8月13日也在香港发表了钦佩新中国的谈话。他说，他在中国看到“许多根本性的改变：人民吃得很好，他们再不穿破烂衣服，穿的很整齐，生活水平提高得很快。”
    加拿大皇家银行行长詹姆斯·谬尔在访问中国以后，也在加拿大多伦多的“环球邮报”上撰文说，“中国工业的增长、生活水平的改善、各个方面的现代化以及人们的干劲和人的劳动的巨大影响是难以笔墨形容。”他说：“我只能说许多事要看到才会相信”。他又说，任何有理智的人如果看到在不到十年完成了以前四千年甚至最近一百年所没有完成的成就，会使他大大吃惊和目瞪口呆的。他说他感到“人们（在中国）没有一种被统治感，那里没有经济萧条，可以自由地旅行各地……。”他认为二十年后中国无疑地将成为一个拥有十亿人口的先进工业大国。
    法国驻香港商务专员格利莫特在访问中国以后，也在香港盛赞中国农村在合作制度之下，水利农具等都获得迅速改进，生产量有了显著提高。他特别提到中国工业遍地开花的政策。他认为这个政策是一种大胆的尝试，是正统的西方专家不能想像的。
