Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The Central Committee members in Beijing and all cadres of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party held a discussion on the morning of the 7th regarding Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots. The meeting was presided over by acting Chairman Ji Fang.

The speeches at the symposium unanimously expressed firm support for the letter to Taiwan compatriots issued by Minister Peng Dehuai of our Ministry of National Defense. The meeting held that the letter to Taiwan compatriots fully reflected the spirit of humanitarianism and expressed the deep concern of the people of the whole country for the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The "suggestion to hold negotiations and implement a peaceful solution" also fully conformed to the interests of the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

The meeting pointed out that American imperialism is the common mortal enemy of all the people of our country. For nine years, it has spared no effort in plundering, ravaging, and trampling on the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is intolerable, and what is not? We should unite as one, point our guns outward, drive the American robbers out of Taiwan, in order to defend the motherland and defend peace. The socialist construction of the motherland is leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." All Chinese compatriots with a sense of national self-esteem and patriotism are rejoicing and cheering for it. We hope that the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will immediately respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call with practical actions, hold negotiations as soon as possible, and take the path of peaceful settlement, so as to return to the embrace of the motherland at an early date and jointly build a prosperous and strong new China.

    农工民主党劝告台湾同胞
    以实际行动响应祖国号召
    新华社7日讯　中国农工民主党中央委员会在京中央委员及中央执行局机关全体干部7日上午就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书举行座谈会。会议由代主席季方主持。
    座谈会上的发言一致表示坚决拥护我国防部彭德怀部长发表的告台湾同胞书。会议认为，告台湾同胞书充分反映了人道主义精神，表达了全国人民对台、澎、金、马军民同胞的深切关怀。其中“建议举行谈判，实行和平解决”也完全符合于台、澎、金、马军民同胞的利益。
    会议指出，美帝国主义是我们全国人民共同的死敌，九年来对台、澎、金、马的军民同胞进行掠夺、蹂躏、践踏无所不用其极，是可忍，孰不可忍？我们应团结一致、枪口对外，把美国强盗赶出台湾，以保卫祖国，保卫和平。祖国的社会主义建设正以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进，稍有民族自尊感和爱国心的中国同胞，无不为之欢欣鼓舞，我们希望台、澎、金、马的军民同胞，立即以实际行动响应彭德怀部长的号召，尽速举行谈判，走和平解决的道路，以便早日回到祖国的怀抱，共同建设繁荣富强的新中国。
