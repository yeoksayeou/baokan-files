The Characteristics of Bourgeois Right - "Freedom and Equality"

The "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas" points out that the gradual disappearance of the remnants of bourgeois right is one of the important conditions for society to enter the communist era.

The most fundamental aspect of bourgeois right, in my opinion, is the sacred and inviolable nature of private property. Because this determines the foundation of bourgeois society. Without this, it cannot be a capitalist society. Lenin, in discussing the lower stage of communist society, namely socialist society, said: "Since the means of production have become public property, then the name 'communism' can also be used here, as long as it is not forgotten that this is not yet complete communism." (Note 1) It is evident that private ownership of property is the foundation of bourgeois right. The Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas points out that what is to be gradually eliminated is the remnants of bourgeois right. Why are they called remnants? That is to say, we have eliminated the private ownership of the means of production, which has already eliminated the foundation of bourgeois right. The bourgeois right that exists in our society now is already a remnant.

Although private ownership of the means of production is the foundation of bourgeois right, it is not the characteristic of bourgeois right. Because private property is the common foundation of class society. Capitalist society is a class society, so the foundation of its right is also private property; however, bourgeois right further sanctifies private property.

So, what is the characteristic of bourgeois right? The characteristic of bourgeois right is the freedom and equality they talk about. Why are freedom and equality the characteristics of bourgeois right? Originally, the bourgeoisie was a class that emerged from feudal society. When this class grew and became stronger, making society more bourgeois, the state was still feudal. This feudal state had numerous tax barriers and many privileges, hindering the bourgeoisie's free trade; at the same time, the bourgeoisie's production, from handicraft workshops to manual factories, also required a certain number of free laborers. On the other hand, the exchange itself, the so-called fair buying and selling, contains the requirement for equal rights; and free laborers, unlike the past serfs attached to the land, that is, attached to the feudal lords, also became negotiating opponents with the factory owners in the form of equal qualifications. At the same time, although the bourgeoisie had strong economic power at this time, it was not the ruling class in politics, and nobles and clergy were above it. Thus, freedom and equality were declared by the bourgeoisie as human rights, and they used this banner to call on the whole people to fight against the feudal monarchs. After the bourgeoisie gained a ruling position, they imbued this freedom and equality into their laws, becoming bourgeois right.

However, this freedom and equality have had the selfish and self-interested nature of the bourgeoisie from the beginning. Engels cited examples to prove this nature, namely: the American Constitution, which first recognized human rights, simultaneously confirmed the existence of black slavery in the United States, class privileges were denounced, while racial privileges were sanctified by law. Later, when capitalism developed to the era of imperialism, especially after World War II, due to the emergence of many socialist countries in the world and the high tide of revolutionary situations in various countries, the bourgeois countries have tried their best to eliminate the bourgeois democratic system, that is, the human rights of freedom and equality they talk about. This completely exposes the hypocrisy of the freedom and equality spoken of by the bourgeoisie.

However, so-called freedom and equality are, after all, the characteristics of bourgeois right. As a reflection of bourgeois relations of production, this characteristic distinguishes capitalist society from the feudal society that spawned it. The right of private property reflects the exploitative nature of this society; coupled with the so-called right of freedom and equality, it reflects the nature of this society as a bourgeois-style exploitative society. It can be seen that the core of bourgeois right is not the hierarchy system. The right of feudal society is the hierarchy system. At that time, there were small feudal lords under the great feudal lords, and at the bottom were serfs, forming a feudal ladder. There is also an ancient Chinese saying that "Heaven has ten suns, and the people have nine ranks." The characteristic of the bourgeois era lies in its simplification of class contradictions, and society is increasingly divided into two major opposing camps, two major opposing classes - the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Of course, in capitalist society, due to the different economic conditions of people, different levels will be formed in life and even in social status; but as far as capitalist right is concerned, it cannot be said that its core is the hierarchy system. On the contrary, what is written in the bourgeois constitution is that all people are equal before the law.

          Unmasking the Bourgeoisie's Freedom and Equality

Since the characteristic of bourgeois right is freedom and equality, then why must bourgeois right be abolished?

Let us take a closer look at the bourgeoisie's so-called freedom and equality. The bourgeoisie's right of freedom and equality is originally a reflection of the bourgeoisie's "free trade" and "equivalent exchange" requirements. Therefore, this right also particularly strengthens the legitimacy of free trade and equivalent exchange. In capitalist society, since labor power has become a commodity, labor power is also "equivalent exchange." Therefore, "do as much work as you get paid" has become a particularly prominent feature of this society. This situation obscures the exploitative nature of the bourgeoisie towards the broad masses of laborers. The bourgeoisie then uses this to vigorously promote the freedom and equality of its society, and says that this society is the embodiment of "eternal truth."

Since "do as much work as you get paid" is the right of this society, conversely, "do as much work as you want as much money" or "give as much money as you do as much work" is of course also the right of this society. In this way, all relationships are connected by money. "Between man and man, there is no other relationship than naked self-interest and cold 'cash transaction'." (Note 2)

Is "do as much work as you get paid" or "give as much money as you do as much work" equal? The bourgeoisie says all day long that they are "humanitarian" and slander that "communists do not talk about humanitarianism." In fact, the bourgeoisie is the least humanitarian, because their right of equality does not start from humanitarianism, but from
  "the way of things." They are making things equal to each other, not making people equal to each other. Communists believe that since people are born into society, they should all be able to live, and live well, which is true equality. "Do as much work as you get paid," not to mention that this is just a cover for the bourgeoisie's exploitation of the broad masses (the bourgeoisie relies on exploiting the unpaid labor of how many people to make a fortune), even if it is taken as a fact, it is also unequal if it is not viewed from the point of view of things but from the point of view of people. People have various different situations, and their income, which they rely on for their livelihood, is only determined by the amount of their labor. For example, if a person has many children, the capitalist does not pay the laborer more because of his many children, or if a person is sick, the capitalist does not give him more wages because he is sick and needs treatment. On the contrary, because he is sick and cannot work or his labor results are not much, he is not hired, laid off, or his wages are deducted. In this way, many people will not be able to live well, or even be unable to live. Is this called equality? On the other hand, "do as much work as you want as much money" also makes people calculate the gains and losses of money, not considering whether this matter should be done, but considering whether doing this matter makes money, or how much money it makes. In this way, silver and gold shine, and justice and righteousness lose color, and the world is superficial, "the difference between man and beast is very small."

It is precisely in order to change this unequal situation in human society that communists have risen up to carry out revolution, abolish classes, and establish a society of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."

Our Task is to Gradually Eliminate the Remnants of Bourgeois Right

At present, our country has abolished the capitalist ownership of the means of production and abolished the most fundamental thing of bourgeois right. However, in terms of distribution, our country still retains the bourgeois right, that is, the principle of "distribution according to work." Due to the rapid development of our society, gradually eliminating these remnants of bourgeois right is also increasingly put on the agenda.

The remnants of bourgeois right should be eliminated. Then, why not abolish them together with the abolition of capitalist ownership of the means of production during socialist transformation? Since they were not abolished in the past, can they be completely abolished immediately today?

No. Eliminating this remnant of bourgeois right requires a certain process and a transitional stage. Communists divide communist society into two stages, that is, taking socialist society as the primary stage of communism as a transitional stage of communism; and building socialism also requires its transitional stage. In the transitional stage, new things gradually grow, and old things gradually disappear. Since socialist society is a transitional stage from capitalism to advanced communist society, it is very natural that capitalist right remains in socialist society. Lenin said: "Marx did not casually stuff 'bourgeois' right into communism (referring to the first stage of communism, namely the socialist stage - author), but seized the economically and politically inevitable things in the society that had just emerged from the womb of capitalism." (Note 3) Therefore, it is impossible to abolish even this remnant of bourgeois right during the period of social transformation. Even today, it is difficult to abolish this remnant of bourgeois right all at once. Because abolishing this remnant of bourgeois right and implementing the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" means that our society has entered communism, but this requires two aspects, namely material aspects and human aspects. This is what the "Central Resolution" points out, the extreme abundance of social products and the extreme improvement of the communist ideological awareness and moral quality of the entire people. Lenin also said: The prerequisites envisioned by communist society are "neither the current labor productivity nor the current philistine." (Note 4)

However, acknowledging that bourgeois right inevitably remains in socialist society does not mean acknowledging the rationality of this right, nor does it mean destined and powerless to wait for the automatic disappearance of this right. Efforts should be made to promote the disappearance of this right. This requires actively creating conditions for disappearance. That is to further improve the communist consciousness of the whole people, and further give play to enthusiasm and develop production. Of course, eliminating the remaining bourgeois right is not to wait for the distant future, after all the conditions are ripe, one day, suddenly announce; but should be with the improvement of people's ideological awareness and the development of production, like planing wooden piles, eliminate a little today, eliminate a little tomorrow, after a few days, this remnant of bourgeois right will be completely eliminated. I understand that the "gradual disappearance" mentioned in the "Central Resolution" is exactly what it means. At present, the "semi-supply system" has been implemented in various places. This is a way to increase communist factors and eliminate the remnants of bourgeois right. In the future, adapted to the specific conditions of our society, similar methods should be gradually implemented. In this way, communist factors will increase even more, the remnants of bourgeois right will be further weakened, and finally become completely ineffective, and some other necessary conditions will gradually be met. At that time, our country will enter the communist era.

    谈谈削除资产阶级法权
    郑季翘
    资产阶级法权的特征——“自由平等”
    “中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”指出，资产阶级法权残余的逐步消失，是社会进入共产主义时代的重要条件之一。
    资产阶级法权中最根本的东西，我以为是私有财产的神圣不可侵犯。因为这是决定资产阶级社会的基础。没有了这一条，就不成其为资本主义社会了。列宁在论到共产主义社会的低级阶段即社会主义社会时，说道：“既然生产资料已成为公有财产，那末‘共产主义’这个名词在这里也是可以用的，只要不忘记这还不是完全的共产主义”。（注一）可见财产私有是资产阶级法权的根基。中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中指出要逐步消失的是资产阶级法权的残余，为什么说是残余？那就是说，我们取消了生产资料的私人所有制，就已经消灭了资产阶级法权的基础，现在在我们社会中存在的资产阶级法权，已经是残余了。
    生产资料的私人所有制虽然是资产阶级法权的根基，然而却不是资产阶级法权的特征。因为财产私有是阶级社会的共同的基础。资本主义社会是阶级社会，所以它的法权的基础，也是财产的私有；不过资产阶级法权更把财产的私有神圣化罢了。
    那末，资产阶级法权的特征是什么呢？资产阶级法权的特征，就是他们所说的自由和平等。为什么说自由、平等是资产阶级法权的特征呢？原来，资产阶级是封建社会中产生出来的一个阶级。当这个阶级更加成长、壮大，使社会更加成为资产阶级式的时候，国家却仍然是封建式的。这种封建式的国家，税卡林立，特权很多，妨碍着资产阶级的自由贸易；同时，资产阶级的生产，由手工作坊转为手工工厂，也需要一定数量的自由劳动者。另一方面，交换本身所谓公买公卖，就包含着平等权利的要求；而自由劳动者，不同于过去农奴附属于土地即附属于封建主的状况，在形式上也成为以平等的资格与厂主谈判的对手。同时，资产阶级这时虽然在经济上有强大的力量，但在政治上却并不是统治的阶级，贵族、僧侣都在它的头上。于是自由、平等便被资产阶级宣布为人权，并用这个旗帜号召全民，与封建君主进行斗争。在资产阶级取得统治地位之后，便把这种自由、平等贯注在他们的法律中，成为资产阶级的法权。
    但是，这种自由、平等，一开始就具有资产阶级的自私自利的性质。恩格斯举出事例证明这种性质，即：最先承认人权的美国宪法，同时确认了存在于美国的黑人奴隶制，阶级的特权受到了指斥，而人种的特权却为法律所神圣化。待到后来，在资本主义发展到帝国主义的时代，特别是第二次世界大战后，由于世界上出现了许多社会主义国家和各国革命形势的高涨，资产阶级国家便竭力消灭资产阶级的民主制度，即他们所说的自由、平等的人权。这就完全揭穿了资产阶级所说的自由、平等的虚伪性。
    但是，所谓自由、平等毕竟是资产阶级法权的特征。这种法权的特征，作为资产阶级生产关系的反映，使资本主义社会区别于孕育它的封建社会。财产私有的法权，反映了这个社会是剥削社会的这种性质；加上所谓自由、平等的法权，就反映了这个社会是资产阶级式的剥削社会的这种性质。可见资产阶级法权的核心并不是等级制度。封建社会的法权，才是等级制度。那时，大封建主下面有小封建主，最下面是农奴，形成一个封建的阶梯。中国古话也有“天有十日，民有九等”的说法。资产阶级时代的特点，就在于它把阶级矛盾简单化了，社会愈益分成为两大敌对的营垒、两大彼此对立的阶级——资产阶级与无产阶级。当然，在资本主义社会，由于人们经济状况的不同，在生活上以至在社会地位上会形成不同的等级；但作为资本主义法权来说，则不能说其核心是等级制度。相反，在资产阶级的宪法上写着的，是人们在法律面前一律平等。
          剥开资产阶级的自由平等的皮来看
    既然资产阶级法权的特征是自由、平等，那为什么一定要破除资产阶级法权呢？
    我们再具体地看资产阶级的所谓自由、平等。资产阶级自由、平等的法权，本来是资产阶级“自由贸易”和“等价交换”要求的反映。所以，这种法权，也特别强化了自由贸易和等价交换的合法性。在资本主义社会中，劳动力既然成为商品，所以劳动力也是“等价交换”的。因而“做多少事，给多少钱”，就成为这个社会特别显著的特征。这种状况，蒙蔽了资产阶级对广大劳动者的剥削性质。资产阶级遂据以大事宣传其社会的自由和平等，并说这种社会是“永恒的真理”的化身。
    既然“做多少事，给多少钱”是这个社会的法权，反过来，“做多少事，要多少钱”或“给多少钱，做多少钱的事”，当然也是这个社会的法权。这样，一切的关系，都以钱为连结点。“人与人之间除了赤条条的利害关系与冷酷的‘现金交易’之外，再没有别的什么关系了”。（注二）
      “做多少事，给多少钱”，或“给多少钱，做多少事”是平等的吗？资产阶级成天说他们是“人道主义”的，并且污蔑说“共产党是不讲人道的”。实际上，资产阶级是最不讲人道的，因为他们这种平等的法权，并不是从人道出发，而是从
  “物道”出发的。他们是使物与物取得平等，而不是使人与人取得平等。共产主义者认为：人们既然生到社会上来，就应该都能生活下去，并且是很好的生活下去，这才是真正的平等。“做多少事，给多少钱”，姑不论这只是掩盖资产阶级对于广大群众的剥削的一个幌子（资产阶级就是靠剥削多少人的无偿劳动来发财致富的），就是把它当作事实，如果不是从物的观点而是从人的观点来看，也是不平等的。人有各种不同的情况，而其生活所赖的收入，却只是由其劳动的分量来决定，例如，一个人孩子多，资本家付给这个劳动者的工资，并不因其多子女而多给分文，或者一个身体有病的人，资本家也并不因其有病需要治疗而多给他工资，相反，却因其有病不能劳动或劳动成果不多而不雇、解雇或扣除其工资。这样，就会使好多人不能很好地生活，甚至不能生活下去。这叫平等吗？另一方面，“做多少事，要多少钱”，也使人们斤斤计较钱的得失，不是考虑这事情该不该做，而是考虑做这事情赚不赚钱，或赚钱多不多。这样便使白银黄金生光，公理正义失色，世情浅薄，“人之异于禽兽者几希”了。
    正是为了改变人类社会的这种不平等状况，共产主义者才起来进行革命，废除阶级，建立“各尽所能，各取所需”社会。
    我们的任务是逐步削除资产阶级法权的残余
    目前，我国已经废除了生产资料的资本主义所有制，废除了资产阶级法权中最根本的东西。但是，在分配问题上，我国还残留着资产阶级的法权，即“按劳取酬”的原则。由于我国社会的迅速发展，逐步消除这些资产阶级法权的残余，也日益提到议事日程上来了。
    资产阶级法权的残余，应该消除，那末，为什么不在进行社会主义改造的时候，与取消生产资料资本主义所有制一同废除？过去既然没有废除，今天是不是可以立刻全部废除呢？
    不行。消除这种资产阶级法权的残余，需要有一定的过程，需要有一个过渡阶段。共产主义者把共产主义社会分作两个阶段，就是把社会主义这一个共产主义的初级阶段作为共产主义的过渡阶段的；而建成社会主义又需要有其过渡阶段。在过渡阶段，新的事物逐渐成长，旧的事物逐渐消失。社会主义社会既然是资本主义向高级的共产主义社会发展的一个过渡阶段，因此，在社会主义社会中，残存着资本主义法权，就是很自然的事。列宁说：“马克思并不是随便把‘资产阶级的’法权塞到共产主义（按指共产主义的第一阶段即社会主义阶段——作者）中去，而是抓住了刚从资本主义腹内脱胎出来的社会里那种在经济上和政治上不可避免的东西。”（注三）所以，在社会改造时期，连这种资产阶级法权残余都废除掉，是不能够的。就在今天，一下把这种资产阶级法权残余废除掉，也是有困难的。因为废除了这种资产阶级法权的残余，实行“各尽所能，各取所需”的原则，就是说我们的社会已经进入共产主义，而这却需要有两方面即物的方面与人的方面的条件。这就是“中央决议”所指出的，社会产品极大的丰富和全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质极大的提高。列宁也说过：共产主义社会所设想的前提，“既不是现在的劳动生产率，也不是现在的庸人”。（注四）
    但是，承认在社会主义社会中不可避免地残存着资产阶级法权，并不等于承认这种法权的合理性，也不等于命定地、无能为力地坐待这种法权的自行消失。应该努力促进这种法权的消失。这就需要积极地创造消失的条件。那便是更进一步的提高全民的共产主义觉悟，更进一步的发挥干劲，发展生产。当然，消除残余的资产阶级法权并不是要等在遥远的将来，待所有的条件成熟之后，有那么一天，忽然宣布；而应该是随着人们的思想觉悟提高和生产发展的状况，如同削木桩一样今天削除一点，明天削除一点，经过若干时日，这种资产阶级法权的残余便被完全削除了。我理解：“中央决议”中所说的“逐步消失”，正是这个意思。目前在各地实行了“半供给制”。这就是增长共产主义因素，削除资产阶级法权残余的一个办法。以后，适应我国社会的具体情况，诸如此类的办法应该逐步实施。这样，共产主义因素更大地增加，资产阶级法权的残余更进一步地削弱，最后以至于完全不起作用了，其他一些必要的条件也逐步具备了。那时，我国就进入了共产主义时代。
