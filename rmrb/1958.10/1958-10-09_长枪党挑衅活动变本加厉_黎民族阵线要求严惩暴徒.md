Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 8th -- Beirut newspapers reported today that the Lebanese National Front held an important meeting on the 7th. Following the meeting, a delegation composed of Yafi, Jumblatt, and Muawad met with President Chehab, demanding that stringent measures be taken against the provocations and riots of the Phalangists. On the 7th, thugs from the Phalangist Party and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party continued their provocations, attempting to put pressure on the Karami government in order to install some of their cronies into the government. Yesterday, Phalangists opened fire and threw bombs in an attempt to prevent vehicles from passing through the eastern district of Beirut. Government troops arrived to suppress the situation, resulting in a battle with the armed thugs. Phalangists also attacked the Beirut cigarette factory, shops, the “Political News” office, and buses yesterday.

Lebanese Prime Minister Karami met with Speaker of Parliament Oseiran on the 7th. They discussed the issue of a vote of confidence in the Karami government by the parliament, and various proposals put forward thus far for “resolving the Lebanese crisis.” The "Al Saiyad" newspaper reported today that President Chehab rejected all suggestions presented to him regarding the formation of a military cabinet, and insisted on maintaining the current government.

Although the Lebanese authorities have requested that the U.S. troops completely withdraw from Lebanon before the end of October, and the United States has been forced to agree, today's newspaper reports show that the United States still intends to delay the withdrawal of its aggressive troops from Lebanon in order to continue using them as a force to support the Chamoun clique in carrying out sabotage.

At the same time, the running dogs fostered by the United States continue to engage in rampant activities. The Phalangist headquarters yesterday began issuing so-called “press releases” in English, slandering the government and inciting unrest.

    长枪党挑衅活动变本加厉
    黎民族阵线要求严惩暴徒
    据新华社大马士革8日电　据此间报纸今天报道贝鲁特的消息说，黎巴嫩民族阵线在7日举行了重要会议。会后，由雅非、琼卜拉特和穆瓦德组成的代表团前往会见谢哈布总统，要求对长枪党徒的挑衅和骚乱采取严厉措施。长枪党和国家社会党匪徒在7日继续进行挑衅，试图对卡拉米政府施加压力，以便把他们的一些党羽安插在政府里面。长枪党徒昨天曾经开枪和扔炸弹，企图阻止车辆通过贝鲁特的东区。政府军队赶到那里镇压，同武装匪徒们发生了战斗。长枪党徒昨天还袭击了贝鲁特的卷烟厂、商店、“政治报”办事处和公共汽车。
    黎巴嫩总理卡拉米在7日会见了议长奥塞兰。他们讨论了议会对卡拉米政府的信任投票问题和到目前为止提出的“解决黎巴嫩危机”的各项建议。“沙牧国报”今天报道，谢哈布总统拒绝了向他提出的关于组织军事内阁的一切建议，而坚持维持现政府。
    尽管黎巴嫩当局已经要求美军在10月底前全部撤出黎巴嫩，美国也被迫同意，但是今天的报纸消息显示，美国还打算拖延撤出它在黎巴嫩的侵略军队，以便继续把它做为支持夏蒙集团进行捣乱的力量。
    与此同时，美国豢养的走狗继续猖狂进行活动。长枪党总部昨天开始用英文发表了所谓“新闻公报”，诬蔑政府和煽动骚乱。
