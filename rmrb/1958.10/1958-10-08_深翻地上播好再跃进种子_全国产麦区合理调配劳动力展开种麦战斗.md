    Mao Zedong said: While vigorously developing steel production, do not neglect agriculture. People's communes must plant wheat well, plant rapeseed well, and deep plow the land well. Agricultural tasks in 1959 should have a greater leap forward than in 1958. To this end, labor in industry and agriculture should be well organized.
    Deep Plowing the Land, Sowing Seeds Well, and Launching Another Leap Forward
    National Wheat-Producing Areas Rationally Allocate Labor to Unfold Wheat Planting Battle
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch – Wheat planting work, with deep plowing as its center, has been universally launched in China's major wheat-producing areas. By the end of September, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and the suburban areas of Beijing had deep plowed more than 391 million mu of land, accounting for more than 44% of the planned winter wheat sowing area in these regions. According to inspections, most of the plowed wheat fields have a depth of more than one chi to about one chi and five cun; the depth of large-area high-yield fields and high-yield "satellite" fields reaches two, three, four, or five chi.

    While plowing, various localities immediately began sowing. Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Anhui and other provinces have sown more than 31 million mu.

    When sowing wheat, people's communes in various localities have adopted yield-increasing measures such as applying more fertilizer, planting densely, and selecting fine varieties of seeds as much as possible. Henan Province applied an average of more than 50,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu of wheat field, Shandong reached 70,000 jin, and Shanxi and Hebei provinces generally reached 25,000 to 50,000 jin per mu. In the past, about 40% of wheat fields in Shaanxi Province were not fertilized with base fertilizer. This year, not only will all fields be fertilized, but also more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer will be applied per mu. In order to promote dense planting, various localities have adopted tools such as dense planting drills for sowing. Generally, the sowing amount per mu has increased from 15 to 20 jin in the past to about 30 jin, and in some areas it has reached 40 jin.

    Due to the rational arrangement of labor and the large-scale promotion of improved tools, wheat sowing work has progressed rapidly in many areas. More than 30 counties in Shaanxi Province have completed wheat planting more than ten days earlier than in previous years. In Hebei Province, Funing and Changli counties mobilized more than 300,000 people, and after more than 20 days of hard work day and night, they basically completed the sowing of more than 420,000 mu of winter wheat before National Day.

    However, according to inspections in various localities, due to the crowding together of various production tasks, the shortage of labor, and the insufficient organization of labor, wheat planting work in some areas has been relatively slow. For example, Hebei Province had planted more than 15 million mu of wheat in early October last year, while this year only more than 6 million mu have been planted.

    Currently, there are only half a month left before the Frost's Descent (October 24th). Before Frost's Descent is a good season for planting wheat in North China. In order to reverse the slow progress of wheat sowing and ensure the timely completion of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, leading organs in various localities have recently issued instructions or held telephone conferences, calling on farmers in various localities to work hard and practically to complete the autumn harvest and planting work in a timely manner. Some areas have also taken measures to draw manpower, without affecting steel production tasks, to strengthen the strength on the agricultural production front. (Attached picture)
    In order to strive to become a province with a thousand catties of wheat per mu next year, Henan Province is vigorously carrying out a deep plowing campaign. This is the members of the Cigou branch of the Xiangcheng Commune using a combination of labor and animal power, continuous plowing method, deep plowing and fertilizing at the same time.

### 深翻地上播好再跃进种子  全国产麦区合理调配劳动力展开种麦战斗

    毛主席说：在大干钢铁的同时，不要把农业丢掉了。人民公社一定要把小麦种好，把油菜种好，把土地深翻好。1959年农业方面的任务，应当比1958年有一个更大的跃进。为此，应当把工业方面和农业方面的劳动力好好组织起来。
    深翻地上播好再跃进种子
    全国产麦区合理调配劳动力展开种麦战斗
    新华社7日讯　以深翻地为中心的种麦工作，已经在我国主要麦产区普遍展开。到9月底止，山东、河南、河北、山西、陕西、江苏、安徽、湖北和北京市郊区已经深翻土地三亿九千一百多万亩，约占这些地区冬麦播种计划面积44％以上。据检查，翻耕的麦田，绝大部分深度都在一尺以上到一尺五寸左右；大面积丰产田和高产“卫星”田深度达到二、三尺或四、五尺。
    各地在翻耕的同时，立即进行播种。河南、山东、河北、山西、陕西、安徽等省已经播种三千一百多万亩。
    各地人民公社在播种小麦时，都采取了多肥、密植和尽可能地选用良种等增产措施。河南省平均每亩麦田施底肥五万斤以上，山东达七万斤，山西、河北两省每亩一般也达二万五千斤到五万斤。陕西省过去有40％左右的麦田不施底肥，今年不仅全部施肥，而且每亩施肥一万斤以上。为了推行密植，各地都采用了密植耧等工具进行播种，一般每亩播种量都由过去的十五斤到二十斤增到三十斤左右，有些地区达到四十斤。
    由于合理安排劳力，大量推广改良工具，不少地区麦播工作进展很快。陕西省已有三十多个县比往年提前十多天种完了小麦。河北省抚宁、昌黎两县出动三十多万人，经过二十多天的日夜苦战，也在国庆节前夕基本上完成了四十二万多亩冬小麦的播种任务。
    但是，据各地检查，由于各项生产任务挤在一起，劳动力紧张以及劳力组织得不够好，有些地区种麦工作比较迟缓。例如，河北省去年10月初已种麦一千五百多万亩，而今年只种了六百多万亩。
    目前，离霜降（10月24日）只剩半个多月了。霜降以前是华北地区种麦的好季节。为了扭转麦播进展迟缓现象，保证做好秋收秋耕秋种，各地领导机关最近都先后发出指示或召开电话会议，号召各地农民苦干实干，一定要把秋收秋种工作适时完成。有些地区还采取措施，在不影响钢铁生产任务的前提下，抽调人力，增强了农业生产战线上的力量。（附图片）
