    Let Communist Ideology Grow Faster
    Wang Kangzhi
    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many submissions discussing the issue of bourgeois right, most of which are opinions on whether the original supply system should have been changed to a wage system after liberation. We hope that this discussion will not be limited to this issue, as the remnants of bourgeois right are also manifested in other aspects. The purpose of this discussion is to have a more correct analysis and criticism of the remnants of bourgeois right and its ideological manifestations, so as to further raise the communist consciousness of all cadres and the broad masses.
    In the struggle for steel and to complete this year's leap forward plan, the broad masses of workers in Tianjin, like workers across the country, have displayed a communist attitude towards labor, consciously and voluntarily engaging in arduous struggle, and increasing production several or even dozens of times. Recently, many factory workers have also voluntarily proposed working overtime without pay and abolishing the piece-rate wage system. They deeply understand that today's labor is not for personal enrichment, nor is it merely for personal subsistence, but to accelerate the country's socialist construction and to realize a communist society. Here, selfish and self-interested plans have almost no place to stand, and money has lost its alluring charm. Many workers say it well: "Our hard work is for communism, for the happiness of future generations, not for piece-rate wages or bonuses." This situation shows that people's attitudes towards labor and labor remuneration are undergoing profound changes, and communist ideology is growing rapidly.
    However, we should also see that cities, especially large cities, have long been the breeding ground of bourgeois right ideology. The bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals have used various forms to eagerly promote the sanctity of private property, the omnipotence of money, egoism, free competition, equality before the law, etc., to poison the minds of the masses and cover up the bourgeoisie's criminal activities of exploitation and plunder. Since the liberation of the country, although we have continuously educated the masses with socialist and communist ideology, the bourgeois right ideology still has a certain influence on some of the less conscious masses. At the same time, in the past, some of our staff members, because politics were not in command, unilaterally emphasized the principles of personal interests and material incentives. They regarded the piece-rate wage system as a sacred object and material incentives as omnipotent. They tried their best to beautify the bourgeois right ideology, but slandered the people's hard-working and simple revolutionary style, mass voluntary labor, and even political and ideological work and the mass line as "rural style" and "guerrilla habits," and even said that they "disrupted the normal order of factories and enterprises." This phenomenon of seeing only things and not people, only emphasizing material incentives and not ideological education, has fueled the development of economistic views among some employees. Therefore, while we must fully see the growth of the communist spirit among the masses, we should not underestimate the influence of bourgeois right ideology on the working masses. In particular, the series of tremendous changes brought about by the in-depth development of socialist revolution and socialist construction has made the contradictions between communist ideas and styles and bourgeois ideas, remnants of bourgeois right, and old lifestyles even more acute and profound. Many people's thinking lags behind reality, lack sufficient ideological preparation for the leap forward development of the revolutionary cause, and have unclear understanding of certain new things, even generating doubts and resistance. These all show that in the issue of accelerating socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism, there is also a struggle between two lines and two ideologies. Therefore, in conjunction with the leap forward in production and work and the ideological state of the masses, launching a vigorous communist ideological education movement, thoroughly criticizing and overcoming bourgeois right ideology, continuing to deepen the struggle of "promoting proletarian ideology and eradicating bourgeois ideology," and educating the masses to better fight for today's socialist construction and for the bright future of communism, has become the central task of the Party's propaganda work.
    The Central Committee of the Party, in its "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," expounded on the issue of the transition from socialism to communism. We should, in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions, explain to the working masses in simple terms what socialism is, what communism is, and the differences and relationship between the two. We must make everyone understand that the realization of communism is the inevitable law of social development, strengthen their determination to take the road of communism, and prepare themselves ideologically to pass the test of communism. We must enable the masses to establish the idea of continuous revolution, and understand that accelerating socialist construction now is also to actively prepare conditions for the transition to communism. We should neither regard communism as mysterious and unattainable, nor should we confuse the lower and higher stages of communism, thinking that we are about to enter a communist society immediately.
    The most important condition for the transition to communism is to have extremely abundant social products. In order to realize this condition, it is necessary to promote a communist attitude towards labor. Some people believe that in a communist society, "food is delivered to the mouth, and clothing is delivered to the hand," and one can enjoy oneself to the fullest without having to work; others only talk about "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," without talking about "from each according to his ability." These are obviously misinterpretations of communism. The beautiful communist society does not fall from the sky, but is created by our own hands. Therefore, in carrying out communist education, it is still necessary to promote the idea that labor is glorious and that labor creates the world, so that the broad masses can understand the truth of "three years of hard work to fundamentally change the face of the motherland" and "a few years of hard work for ten thousand years of happiness," criticize the weary mood of clamoring "when will the hard work end," and promote the tenacious spirit of daring to overcome all difficulties, so that production continues to leap forward and social products gradually become abundant.
    In order to rapidly build socialism and transition to communism, there must not only be sufficient material preparation, but also sufficient ideological preparation. Therefore, another important task of communist education is to educate the masses with communist ideology, and thoroughly criticize and overcome bourgeois right ideology. Bourgeois right ideology is manifested in many aspects, but in factories and enterprises, it is prominently manifested in issues such as the wage system and material rewards. Many people exaggerate the role of the piece-rate wage system and material incentives, regarding them as the driving force for promoting production, which is obviously wrong. We know that "to each according to his work" is a distribution system suitable for the first stage of communism—socialist society. Compared with the capitalist distribution principle of "labor without reward" and "no labor and gain," it is much more rational and superior. In the socialist stage, because products are not yet abundant enough, the ideological consciousness of the broad masses is not high enough, and education has not yet been greatly popularized and improved, it is still necessary to adopt this distribution system that uses labor as a measure. However, this distribution system is still a manifestation of bourgeois right, a birthmark left over from the old society, and it actually still exists in inequality. Therefore, for the principle of "to each according to his work," we must both recognize it and limit it and gradually eliminate it, rather than beautify it, develop it, or expand it. We must especially emphasize putting politics in command, strengthen communist education, and constantly improve people's ideological consciousness and moral character, and should not emphasize material incentives. In fact, since the rectification movement, workers in many factories have conducted a great debate on the wage system, and they have listed the six major crimes of the piece-rate wage system: First, it affects product quality; second, it hinders unity and cooperation among employees; third, it increases the consumption of raw materials; fourth, it is not conducive to safe production; fifth, it promotes the development of individualism and affects the ideological progress of workers; and sixth, it expands the differences in the actual living standards of employees. This is the correct conclusion made by the working masses on the piece-rate wage system, and it is also a powerful criticism of bourgeois right.
    In order to overcome the remnants of bourgeois right, we must also publicize the great significance of the cultural revolution, further implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and launch a movement among the working masses to study culture, technology, and theory. We must use ten to fifteen years to popularize higher education. Except for the elderly, sick, and disabled, everyone should receive a university education, everyone should be an intellectual, and finally eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor. Every worker, especially young workers, should have great ambitions and aspirations, study hard, and make themselves laborers with high cultural knowledge and new people of communism, so as to accelerate the elimination of the remnants of bourgeois right and create conditions for the early realization of communism.
    Carrying out the communist education movement among the working masses is an extremely important task. We must rely on the leadership of the Party, organize a strong ideological front, and launch a large-scale mass movement. Around the work of all-people steelmaking, the establishment of people's communes, and the popularization of education, mobilize the masses to speak out freely, debate extensively, destroy the old and establish the new, overcome bourgeois right ideology, and raise the red flag of communism high. Through this movement, we will further inspire the communist enthusiasm of the working masses and better promote the progress of various construction undertakings.

    让共产主义思想更快地成长
    王亢之
    编者按：最近，我们每天收到不少讨论资产阶级法权问题的稿件，其中绝大部分是关于解放后应不应该把原来的供给制改为工资制这个问题的意见。我们希望，这次讨论不限于这个问题，因为资产阶级法权的残余还表现在其他方面。这次讨论的目的，是为了对资产阶级法权的残余和它的思想表现有比较正确的分析和批判，以进一步提高全体干部和广大群众的共产主义觉悟。
    在为钢而战和完成今年跃进计划的斗争中，天津市的广大职工和全国各地的工人群众一样，发挥共产主义的劳动态度，自觉自愿地进行苦战，几倍几十倍地提高了生产。最近，许多工厂的职工又自动提出加班加点不要报酬和取消计件工资制的要求。他们深刻地理解到，今天的劳动既不是为了个人的发财致富，也不是仅仅为了个人的温饱，而是为了加速国家的社会主义建设，为了实现共产主义社会。在这里，自私自利的打算几无容身之地，金钱已经失去了它的诱人的魅力。许多工人说得好：“我们苦战是为了共产主义，为了子孙万代的幸福，并不是为了计件工资、超额奖励”。这种情况表明：人们对待劳动和劳动报酬的态度正在发生着深刻的变化，共产主义思想正在迅速成长。
    但是，我们还应该看到，城市特别是大城市过去很长时期是资产阶级法权思想的巢穴。资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子曾经利用各种形式，亟力宣扬私有财产的神圣不可侵犯，金钱万能，利己主义，自由竞争，在法律面前人人平等，等等，来毒化群众的思想，掩盖资产阶级进行剥削掠夺的罪恶活动。全国解放以来，虽然我们不断以社会主义和共产主义思想教育群众，但资产阶级法权思想，对于一部分觉悟不高的群众，仍有一定的影响。同时，过去一个时期我们有些工作人员，因为政治没有挂帅，曾经片面地强调个人利益、物质刺激的原则，他们把计件工资奉为神灵，把物质刺激视为万能。他们极力美化资产阶级法权思想，却把人们的艰苦朴素的革命作风、群众性的义务劳动，甚至政治思想工作、群众路线，都毁之为“农村作风”、“游击习气”，并且据说还“破坏了工厂企业的正常秩序”。这种只见物不见人、只重物质刺激不重思想教育的现象，助长了某些职工的经济主义观点的发展。所以，我们一方面要充分看到群众中共产主义精神的成长，同时也不应该低估资产阶级法权思想对工人群众的影响。特别是最近由于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的深入发展所带来的一系列的巨大变革，使得共产主义的思想、风格，同资产阶级思想、资产阶级法权残余以及旧的生活方式的矛盾，是更加尖锐、深刻了。许多人思想落后于实际，对革命事业的飞跃发展缺乏足够的思想准备，对某些新事物认识不清，甚至产生怀疑、抵触情绪。这些都说明在加速社会主义建设并逐步过渡到共产主义的问题上，也存在着两条路线和两种思想的斗争。因此，结合生产、工作的跃进以及群众的思想状况，大张旗鼓地开展共产主义思想教育运动，彻底地批判和克服资产阶级法权思想，继续深入“兴无灭资”的斗争，教育群众更好地为今天的社会主义建设而战，为共产主义美好的明天而战，就成为党的宣传工作的中心任务。
    党中央在“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”中，阐述了由社会主义向共产主义过渡的问题。我们应该根据中央指示的精神，向工人群众通俗地讲解什么是社会主义，什么是共产主义，以及两者的区别和关系。使大家懂得实现共产主义是社会发展的必然规律，坚定走共产主义道路的决心，作好过共产主义这一关的思想准备。要使群众树立不断革命的思想，懂得现在加快社会主义建设，同时也就是为了向共产主义过渡积极准备条件。我们既不应当把共产主义看得神秘莫测，高不可攀，也要防止把共产主义的低级阶段和高级阶段混为一谈，认为现在马上就要进入共产主义社会了。
    过渡到共产主义最重要的一个条件是要有极为丰富的社会产品，为了实现这个条件，就必须发扬共产主义的劳动态度。有人认为：到了共产主义社会，“饭到张口，衣到伸手”，可以尽情享受，不必劳动了；也有的人只讲“各取所需”，而不讲“各尽所能”，这些显然是对共产主义的曲解。美好的共产主义社会不是从天上掉下来的，而是靠我们的双手创造的。因此，在进行共产主义教育中，仍然要宣传劳动光荣、劳动创造世界的思想，使广大群众认识“苦战三年，基本改变祖国面貌”、“几年辛苦、万年幸福”的道理，批判那种叫嚷“苦战何时了”的厌倦情绪，发扬勇于战胜一切困难的顽强精神，使生产不断跃进，使社会产品逐渐的丰富起来。
    为了迅速建成社会主义并向共产主义过渡，不仅要有充分的物质准备，而且要有充分的思想准备。因此共产主义教育的另一个重要任务，就是要用共产主义思想去教育群众，彻底批判和克服资产阶级法权思想。资产阶级的法权思想表现在很多方面，但在工厂企业中，突出地表现在工薪制度和物质奖励等问题上。很多人夸大计件工资制和物质刺激的作用，把它看成是促进生产的动力，显然这是错误的。我们知道：“按劳取酬”是适合共产主义第一阶段——社会主义社会的分配制度，它同“劳而不获”、“不劳而获”的资本主义的分配原则比较起来，要合理的多，优越的多。在社会主义阶段，由于产品还不够多，广大群众的思想觉悟还不够高，以及教育还没有大大普及和提高，采取这种以劳动作为尺度的分配制度，还是必要的。但是，这种分配制度，仍是资产阶级法权的表现，是旧社会遗留下来的斑痣，它在实际上还存在着不平等。因此，对于“按劳取酬”的原则，我们既要承认它，又要限制它、逐步消灭它，而不能美化它、发展它、扩大它。我们必须特别强调政治挂帅，加强共产主义教育，不断提高人们的思想觉悟和道德品质，而不应强调物质刺激。事实上，整风运动以来，很多工厂的工人就对工资制度进行了大辩论，他们列举了计件工资制的六大罪状：一、影响了产品质量；二、妨碍了职工间的团结协作；三、增加了原材料的损耗；四、不利于安全生产；五、助长个人主义的发展，影响了工人思想进步；六、扩大了职工间实际生活水平的差别。这是工人群众对计件工资制作出的正确的结论，也是对资产阶级法权的有力的批判。
    为了克服资产阶级法权的残余，我们还必须宣传文化革命的重大意义，进一步贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，在工人群众中间开展学文化、学技术、学理论的运动。我们要用十年至十五年的时间普及高等教育，除年老病残者外，人人都要受到大学教育，人人都是知识分子，最后消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别。每一个工人特别是青年工人，都应该立大志，有雄心，努力学习，使自己成为有高度文化知识的劳动者、共产主义的新人，从而加快资产阶级法权残余的消灭，为早日实现共产主义创造条件。
    向工人群众进行共产主义教育运动，是一项极端重要的任务。我们必须依靠党的领导，组织强有力的思想战线，开展大规模的群众运动。围绕着全民炼钢、成立人民公社、普及教育等工作，发动群众大鸣大放、大争大辩，大破大立，克服资产阶级法权思想，把共产主义的红旗高高举起，通过这一运动进一步鼓舞工人群众的共产主义干劲，更好地推动各项建设事业前进。　（作者是中共天津市委书记处书记）
