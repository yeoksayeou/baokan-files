Chairman Mao in Anhui
Our Correspondent

Chairman Mao Zedong inspected work in Anqing, Shucheng, Hefei, Wuhu, Ma'anshan and other places in Anhui Province from September 16th to 20th. Wherever Chairman Mao went, he cordially shook hands and talked with workers, farmers, students, and cadres, and gave important instructions on various tasks. Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Huang Yan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor of Anhui Province, and the heads of local Party committees accompanied Chairman Mao on the inspection. Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, accompanied Chairman Mao on this inspection of Anhui Province. During Chairman Mao's inspection, Tan Zhenlin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhang Yunyi, Luo Ruiqing, members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Yun, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also came to Anhui Province to inspect work.

Chairman Mao arrived in Anqing on the 16th, and after inspecting the Anqing Iron and Steel Plant and Anqing No. 1 Middle School, he took a car to Hefei on the same day. On the way, he inspected the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County. On the 17th, he visited the Anhui Provincial Museum in Hefei. On the 18th, he inspected the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Experimental Field—the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, inspected the Hefei Steel Plant, and visited the Anhui Provincial New Agricultural Tool Exhibition. On the 19th, Chairman Mao met with more than 200,000 people in Hefei, and then took a car to Wuhu. On the 20th, after inspecting the Wuhu Shipyard in Wuhu, he went to Ma'anshan and inspected the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant.

Develop the Steel Industry
We Must Launch Mass Movements

Chairman Mao attached great importance to the development of the steel industry and inspected four steel plants in Anhui Province. At the Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, Chairman Mao inquired in detail about the plant's situation and watched the iron tapping from the plant's two 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces. Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, told Chairman Mao that the plant now produces more than 20 tons of iron per day and is the iron and steel experimental field of the Provincial Party Committee. Chairman Mao smiled and said: "Yes! The Provincial Party Committee should take the lead!" Chairman Mao asked if all the people participating in labor in this factory were workers. Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that except for a few technical workers, the vast majority were cadres from government organizations. Chairman Mao smiled and nodded repeatedly, expressing his satisfaction. When Chairman Mao inspected the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, he braved the rain to see the plant's No. 5 medium-sized blast furnace, the steelmaking workshop, and the No. 7 and No. 8 blast furnaces. He inquired in detail about the plant's various situations, and Wei Anmin, First Secretary of the Ma'anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, answered them one by one. Chairman Mao said that Ma'anshan has very good conditions and can be developed into a medium-sized iron and steel complex, because the development of medium-sized iron and steel complexes is relatively fast. After Chairman Mao inspected several steel plants in Anhui Province, he focused on the issue of developing the steel industry. He instructed: "To develop the steel industry, we must launch mass movements. We must launch mass movements in all our work. It is impossible without mass movements."

Since Eating Doesn't Cost Money,
In the Future, Wearing Clothes Won't Cost Money Either

When Chairman Mao inspected the Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, he praised the commune's work in eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene. He said: "This commune is very clean." Chairman Mao visited the commune's exhibition room and tea factory. In the exhibition room, Chairman Mao saw the commune's long-term plan model and various new agricultural tools. Chairman Mao walked out of the tea factory and looked at the lush green forests behind the mountain. Yang Zhongying, Secretary of the Township Party Committee, told the Chairman: "Some tea gardens are on this hillside." Chairman Mao said: "In the future, we should open up more tea gardens on the hillside." The Shucha People's Commune has seen great development in agricultural and tea production this year. The total grain output this year is expected to reach 72 million catties, with an average yield of 1,600 catties per mu, an increase of 138% over last year. The average person has 1,900 catties of grain, an increase of 136% over last year. After the commune set up public canteens, it has implemented free meals. Chairman Mao said: "Since one commune can do it, other communes with conditions can do it too. Since eating doesn't cost money, in the future, wearing clothes won't cost money either." Comrade Zeng Xisheng told Chairman Mao that the Shucha People's Commune, with more than 8,600 households, now raises 32,000 pigs. The commune's canteen can now provide each person with half a catty of pork per week. In the future, the commune plans to raise 60,000 pigs. If half are eaten and half are sold, then each person can eat an average of four taels of pork per day. Comrade Zeng Xisheng said that the commune's canteen does not currently provide vegetables, and members bring their own vegetables. In the future, vegetables will also be provided. Chairman Mao was very happy to hear this and instructed: "People's communes should concentrate on growing vegetables in the future, and vegetable growing should also be specialized."

Bring the Water Network Map to Beijing

When Chairman Mao visited the agricultural hall of the Anhui Provincial Museum, he saw the cotton from Fuxing Township in Chaoxian County displayed in the hall. The cotton stalk of this cotton plant was as tall as a person. The Chairman touched the cotton stalk and cotton boll with his hands and said with a smile: "There are a lot of peaches on this cotton plant!" Chairman Mao looked at the card hanging on the cotton stalk. The card stated that this was a specimen of a high-yield field of about two mu of cotton in Fuxing Township. The variety was Dai Zi Cotton No. 15, the density per mu was 6,233 plants, and each plant already had an average of 65 mature peaches. The expected yield per mu of seed cotton was 10,180 catties. Chairman Mao also saw two tobacco leaves collected from the experimental field of the Fengyang County Tobacco Experimental Station. Each plant was more than one zhang tall, and the leaves were like water plantains. Chairman Mao said: "These two tobacco leaves are very good." The guide told Chairman Mao: "According to the current growth situation, it is estimated that each mu can harvest more than 33,000 catties." Chairman Mao then saw the large-scale high-yield situation of wheat, rice and other crops in the hall. Chairman Mao saw the explanation of the large-scale high-yield of rice in Xingfu Township, Langxi County. This township harvested a total of 49.48 million catties of rice from 16,450 mu of early rice, with an average yield of 3,008 catties per mu, more than ten times higher than in 1956. The average person had 5,104 catties of rice in one season of early rice alone. After completing the purchase task, the average person reached 3,997 catties of rice. Chairman Mao nodded with a smile after understanding this situation.

In the water conservancy hall, Chairman Mao carefully looked at the achievements and future plans of the implementation of river network in Huaibei. On the schematic diagram of the river network in Suixi County, the various lines representing the river channels were as dense as a spider web. Chairman Mao asked what the thin red line on the map meant. Zhang Zuoyin, Minister of the Provincial Party Committee's Infrastructure Department, replied: "This represents small river channels, which are 20 meters wide. According to the new plan, there are five types of river channels in the Huaibei river network, the widest of which is 60 meters." Chairman Mao asked: "How is the county's river channel excavation progressing?" Zhang Zuoyin said: "The county plans to excavate 350,000 cubic meters per square kilometer, and 110,000 cubic meters have now been excavated." Chairman Mao also asked: "Are there any depressions used as reservoirs?" Zhang Zuoyin said: "We have already made or are preparing to make reservoirs in all places that can be made into reservoirs; for the water in the plains, we mainly store it in the river network." Chairman Mao said happily: "This is very interesting." Then Chairman Mao looked at the overall map of the Huaibei river network and asked what the red and green lines on the map meant. Zhang Zuoyin told the Chairman: "The red lines represent river channels that have not been excavated, and the green lines represent river channels that have been excavated. There are now more than 9,100 large and medium-sized river channels excavated in the entire Huaibei area." Chairman Mao said: "Ah! A big project." Chairman Mao said to Comrade Zeng Xisheng: "When the National Party Congress is held next year, you should hang this picture in Beijing."

The Local Methods of Eliminating the Four Pests are Good

In the Four Pests Elimination Exhibition Hall, Chairman Mao carefully looked at dozens of tools for eliminating the four pests. Chairman Mao saw a live-board mousetrap. As long as a mouse steps on the live-board, it can be caught immediately even if it doesn't eat the bait. Chairman Mao said with a smile: "Mice are very cunning, so the mice will suffer a lot." Yang Jie, Deputy Commander of the Provincial Four Pests Elimination Headquarters, introduced to Chairman Mao a "homemade cat" made of two adobe bricks, which is convenient, economical, and very effective. Mice like to walk along the wall, and they can be caught as soon as they touch it. A village in Jieshou County killed more than 2,000 mice using this method. Chairman Mao said: "This method is good." Chairman Mao read the general description of the Four Pests Elimination Exhibition Hall: From November 1, last year, to the end of July this year, Anhui Province eliminated more than 210 million rats, more than 130 million sparrows, and 11.93 million catties of mosquito larvae, and eliminated a large number of bedbugs, fleas and other pests. After Chairman Mao finished reading this description, he said: "You have eliminated so many rats and sparrows!" Chairman Mao then asked: "How much grain can be saved by eliminating so many rats and sparrows?" Yang Jie replied: "The grain saved can be calculated at 500 catties per person per year, which can feed 6 million people for a year."

In the Anhui Provincial Museum, Chairman Mao also visited the industrial, transportation, postal and telecommunications, finance and trade, culture and education, forestry, aquatic products, health, historical relics and other halls. In the Finance and Trade Hall, Chairman Mao watched the demonstration of the automatic grain vending machine and shook hands with Song Kechen, the creator of the automatic grain vending machine. Chairman Mao visited the automatic stamp vending machine and the automatic newspaper vending machine in the Postal and Telecommunications Hall. In the Health Exhibition Hall, Chairman Mao was very concerned about the situation of eliminating schistosomiasis and expressed his happiness that more than 100 townships in 14 counties in Anhui Province had eliminated schistosomiasis.

At the New Agricultural Tool Exhibition, Chairman Mao carefully visited various tools for lifting water, transporting soil, cultivating and harvesting. Chairman Mao visited the operation demonstration of the capstan deep plowing plow with great interest. Comrade Zeng Xisheng told the Chairman: "Deep plowing in Huainan is relatively difficult. It is still difficult for two cows to pull the plow. We must develop this kind of capstan to solve the problem of deep plowing." Chairman Mao said: "This kind of capstan deep plowing plow should be widely promoted." When Chairman Mao learned that most of the people who created these new agricultural tools were ordinary workers and farmers, he constantly praised the wisdom of the masses.

The Prospects for the Countryside are Very Promising

When Chairman Mao inspected Anqing No. 1 Middle School, he expressed his satisfaction with the school's achievements in combining work-study programs, education and labor. The school has built eight small blast furnaces, which have been put into production one after another, and has established a motor manufacturing factory and a woodworking factory, where students take turns to participate in labor. During the inspection, Chairman Mao cordially shook hands and talked with students who were smelting iron and working. Chairman Mao saw the students in worker uniforms and covered in dust in front of the iron smelting furnace and asked: "Are you workers or students?" The students rushed to say: "We are all students." Chairman Mao then asked kindly: "Have you all learned how to smelt iron?" The students replied in unison: "We have learned!" At this time, the 1.04-cubic-meter small blast furnace was tapping iron. Chairman Mao saw that the students were full of energy and said with a happy smile: "Good! Good!"

On the way from Anqing to Hefei, Chairman Mao inspected the rural areas along the way. Chairman Mao saw that the late rice on both sides of the road was a lush green and growing very vigorously. Many farmers were "burning buns," and smoke filled the air. Chairman Mao asked: "Is this kind of 'burning buns' very common?" Comrade Zeng Xisheng said: "Very common." Chairman Mao asked again: "What is the effect?" Comrade Zeng Xisheng said: "It is mainly to accumulate fertilizer, kill insects, and improve the soil." Chairman Mao said, "It also has the effect of deep plowing." Chairman Mao saw many slogans along the way, on the walls, on the trees, on the roofs, and even on the ground and on the ridges. There were vivid slogans everywhere, and in many places there were Leap Forward Gates, propaganda boards, and propaganda stations. Chairman Mao said: "The propaganda work is very well done." Chairman Mao said happily after arriving in Hefei: "Looking along the way, it is full of vitality, and it is definitely promising, very promising."

Only by Running the People's Commune Well Can Women be Completely Liberated

During his stay in Hefei, Chairman Mao also talked with many women cadres. When talking about women's work, Chairman Mao said: "If each person does not have 1,000 catties or 2,000 catties of food per year, there is no public canteen, no happy courtyard, no nursery, no literacy, no entry into primary school, middle school, and university, women cannot be completely liberated." Chairman Mao pointed out that only by running the people's commune well can women be completely liberated. The people's commune implements the wage system and supply system. Wages are paid to everyone, not to the head of the family. Women and young people must be very happy. This will break the patriarchal system and break the bourgeois legal ideology.

During his inspection in various parts of Anhui, Chairman Mao met cordially with the broad masses of people. In Anqing, Shucheng, Hefei, Wuhu, Ma'anshan and other places, about 400,000 people met with Chairman Mao. Among these people were workers, farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, teachers and students of schools, cadres of government organizations, gray-haired old people, and Young Pioneers wearing red scarves. They believed that being able to see the great people's leader Chairman Mao was an unforgettable happiness and an extremely great encouragement. They were all happy for Chairman Mao's health.

Chairman Mao's inspection in various parts of Anhui brought endless strength to the broad masses of people and cadres. After Chairman Mao inspected the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, many people in the plant wrote resolutions for a great leap forward that night, and many people were unwilling to leave work and continued to work until the next morning without resting. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has decided to increase the daily output of pig iron from the current 1,100 tons to 2,000 tons in the near future. The Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant is stepping up the construction and installation of blast furnaces No. 3 and No. 4, and striving to put them into production around National Day. The Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant has also decided to add seven pairs of 13-cubic-meter blast furnaces and strive to complete them and put them into production in early November. After seeing Chairman Mao, more than 1,000 female workers at the Anhui No. 1 Textile Factory unanimously proposed to respond to Chairman Mao's concern with practical actions of stepping up production. The Class A workers in the cleaning workshop originally looked after an average of eight machines per person, but on the 19th they increased it to sixteen machines per person. Qu Tingbei, a welder and provincial model worker at the Hefei Mining Machinery Factory, and the workers in the entire team were welding shrouds for blast furnaces. Originally, one shift could only weld two and a half a day. After meeting Chairman Mao, they proposed to weld three and a half a day. As a result, they welded sixteen in one shift on the 19th. After Chairman Mao's inspection, Anqing No. 1 Middle School held a symposium on the same evening. Everyone unanimously proposed to muster greater efforts, strive for the top, and do a better job in work-study programs. The symposium decided to accelerate the construction of a 1.5-cubic-meter small blast furnace and double the pig iron output, guaranteeing to produce 100 tons of pig iron by the end of the year, and striving for 120 tons. Now, the masses and cadres in various parts of Anhui are responding to Chairman Mao's concern with a new leap forward upsurge. (Attached picture)

    毛主席在安徽
    本报记者
    毛泽东主席9月16日到20日在安徽省安庆、舒城、合肥、芜湖、马鞍山等地视察工作。毛主席每到一处，都和工人、农民、学生、干部亲切握手谈话，并就各项工作作了重要指示。陪同毛主席视察工作的有中共安徽省委第一书记曾希圣，中共安徽省委书记处书记、安徽省省长黄岩，以及各地党委的负责人。这次随毛主席来安徽省视察工作的有国防委员会副主席张治中。在毛主席视察期间，中共中央政治局委员谭震林，中共中央委员张云逸、罗瑞卿，中共中央候补委员章蕴等同志也来安徽省视察工作。
    毛主席在16日到达安庆，在安庆视察了安庆钢铁厂和安庆第一中学后，当天乘车到合肥，途中又视察了舒城县的舒茶人民公社。17日在合肥参观了安徽省博物馆。18日在合肥视察了省委钢铁试验田——省委钢铁厂，视察了合肥钢厂，参观了安徽省新式农具展览会。19日毛主席在合肥和二十多万群众见面，随即乘车至芜湖，20日在芜湖视察了芜湖造船厂以后，又前往马鞍山，视察了马鞍山钢铁厂。
    发展钢铁工业
    一定要搞群众运动
    毛主席对发展钢铁工业极为重视，在安徽省先后视察了四个钢铁厂。在省委钢铁厂，毛主席详细询问了这个厂的情况，并看了这个厂两座十三立方公尺高炉的出铁情况。省委书记处书记李任之告诉毛主席说，这个厂现在每天出铁二十多吨，是省委的钢铁试验田。毛主席笑着说：“对啊！省委应该带头办啊！”毛主席问在这个厂参加劳动的是不是都是工人，曾希圣同志说，除少数技术工人以外，绝大多数是机关干部，毛主席笑着连连点头，表示满意。毛主席在马鞍山钢铁厂视察时，冒雨看了这个厂的五号中型高炉，炼钢车间，七号、八号高炉，详细询问了这个厂的各种情况，中共马鞍山市委第一书记魏安民一一作了回答。毛主席说，马鞍山条件很好，可以发展成为中型钢铁联合企业，因为发展中型的钢铁联合企业比较快。毛主席视察了安徽省几个钢铁厂以后，着重谈到发展钢铁工业的问题。他指示说：“发展钢铁工业一定要搞群众运动，什么工作都要搞群众运动，没有群众运动是不行的”。
    既然吃饭不要钱，
  将来穿衣也可以不要钱
    毛主席视察舒城县舒茶人民公社时，称赞了这个社的除四害和讲卫生工作，他说：“这个社很干净。”毛主席参观了这个公社的展览室和制茶厂。在展览室里，毛主席看了这个社远景规划的模型和各种新式农具。毛主席走出制茶厂远望后山苍翠的丛林，乡党委书记杨忠应告诉主席说：“有些茶园就在这山坡上。”毛主席说：“以后山坡上要多多开辟茶园。”舒茶人民公社今年的农业和茶叶生产都有很大发展，今年的粮食总产量预计可达到七千二百万斤，平均亩产一千六百斤，比去年增加138％，每人平均有粮一千九百斤，比去年增加136％。这个公社办公共食堂以后，已经实行了吃饭不要钱。毛主席说：“吃饭不要钱，既然一个社能办到，其他有条件的社也能办到。既然吃饭可以不要钱，将来穿衣服也就可以不要钱了。”曾希圣同志告诉毛主席说，舒茶人民公社八千六百多户现已养猪三万二千头，现在这个公社的食堂每星期每人可以吃到半斤猪肉，将来全社计划养猪六万头，如果吃一半，卖一半，这样每人每天平均可吃到四两猪肉。曾希圣同志说，这个公社的食堂目前还不供给蔬菜，由社员自带蔬菜吃，将来也是要供给蔬菜的。毛主席听了很高兴，指示说：“人民公社将来要集中种蔬菜，种蔬菜也要专业化。”
  把水网化图带到北京去
    毛主席在参观安徽省博物馆农业馆时，看了陈列在馆内的巢县复兴乡的棉花，这株棉花的棉秆有一人高，主席用手摸摸棉秆和棉桃，笑着说：“这株棉花的桃子不少！”毛主席看看挂在棉秆上的卡片，卡片上说明，这是复兴乡约两亩棉花丰产田的标本，品种是岱字棉十五号，每亩密度是六千二百三十三株，平均每株已有成桃六十五个，预计亩产籽棉一万零一百八十斤。毛主席又看了从凤阳县烟草试验站试验田里采集来的两株烟叶，每株足有一丈多高，叶子就像水芭蕉一样。毛主席说：“这两株烟叶很好。”讲解员告诉毛主席：“据当前生长情况预计，每亩可收三万三千多斤。”毛主席接着又在馆内看了小麦、水稻等作物的大面积丰产情况。毛主席看到郎溪县幸福乡水稻大面积丰产的说明，这个乡一万六千四百五十亩早稻，共收稻谷四千九百四十八万斤，平均亩产三千零八斤，较1956年提高十倍以上，仅一季早稻平均每人有五千一百零四斤，完成征购任务以后，平均每人达到稻谷三千九百九十七斤。毛主席了解了这个情况后，笑着点点头。
    在水利馆里，毛主席很仔细地看了淮北实行河网化的成就和将来的规划。在濉溪县河网化示意图上，表示河道的各种线条密如蛛网。毛主席问图上的细红线是什么意思，省委基建部部长张祚荫回答说：“这是表示小河道，有二十公尺宽，淮北河网化，根据新的规划共有五种河道，最宽的有六十公尺”。毛主席问：“这个县的河道已挖得怎样了？”张祚荫说：“全县计划每平方公里挖三十五万公方，现在已挖了十一万公方。”毛主席又问：“有没有洼地做水库？”张祚荫说：“凡是能做水库的我们都已经或者准备做水库；平原地区的水，我们主要是把它蓄在河网里面。”毛主席高兴地说：“这个很有意思。”接着毛主席又看了淮北河网化的总图，问图上的红线和绿线是表示什么，张祚荫告诉主席说：“红线是表示没有挖成的河道，绿线是表示已挖成的河道，现在整个淮北挖成的大中河道已有九千一百多条。”毛主席说：“啊！大工程。”毛主席对曾希圣同志说：“明年开全国党代表大会时，你们应该把这张图挂到北京去。”
    除四害的土办法好
    在除四害陈列馆里，毛主席详细看了几十种除四害的工具。毛主席看到一种活板捕鼠夹，只要老鼠一踏上活板，即使不吃食也能立即打住。毛主席笑着说：“老鼠这个东西很狡猾，这样，老鼠就要大遭殃啦”。省除四害指挥部副指挥杨杰向毛主席介绍了一种用两块土坯吊着做成的“土老猫”，既方便，又经济，而且效果很大，老鼠喜欢沿着墙走，只要一碰上就能打住，界首县有一个庄用这个办法就打死二千多只老鼠。毛主席说：“这个办法好。”毛主席看了除四害陈列馆的总的说明：安徽省从去年11月1日到今年7月底止，共灭鼠二亿一千多万只，灭雀一亿三千多万只，蚊蝇蛆蛹等一千一百九十三万斤，并消灭了大量的臭虫、跳蚤等害虫。毛主席念完了这个说明以后，说：“你们消灭的老鼠麻雀真多！”毛主席接着问：“消灭这样多鼠雀可以节省多少粮食？”杨杰回答说：“节省的粮食以每人每年五百斤计算，可供六百万人吃一年。”
    在安徽省博物馆，毛主席还参观了工业、交通、邮电、财贸、文化教育、林业、水产、卫生、历史文物等馆。在财贸馆，毛主席看了自动售粮器的表演，并和自动售粮器的创造者宋克臣握手。毛主席在邮电馆参观了自动售邮机和自动售报机。在卫生陈列馆，毛主席非常关心消灭血吸虫病的情况，对安徽省已有十四个县一百多个乡消灭了血吸虫病表示高兴。
    毛主席在新式农具展览会，详细参观了提水、运土、耕作和收割等各种工具。毛主席以很大兴趣参观了绞车深耕犁的操作表演。曾希圣同志告诉主席说：“淮南深耕比较困难，两条牛拉犁还很吃力，一定要发展这种绞车才能解决深耕问题。”毛主席说：“这种绞车深耕犁要普遍推广。”当毛主席知道了创造这些新式农具的大多是普通工人和农民时，对群众的智慧不断赞扬。
    农村前景大有希望
    毛主席在视察安庆一中时，对这个学校勤工俭学、教育与劳动相结合的成就表示满意。这个学校已建成了八座小高炉，先后投入生产，并且建立一个电机制造厂，一个木工厂，由学生轮流参加劳动。毛主席在视察时和正在炼铁和做工的学生亲切地握手谈话。毛主席看到炼铁炉前穿着工人服满面灰尘的学生，问道：“你们是工人还是学生？”学生们抢着说：“我们都是学生。”毛主席又亲切地问道：“你们都学会炼铁啦？”学生们又齐声回答说：“学会啦！”这时一点零四立方公尺的小高炉正在出铁，毛主席看到学生们满身干劲，高兴地笑着说：“好！好！”
    毛主席在乘车从安庆至合肥的途中，视察了沿途农村情况。毛主席看到公路两侧的晚稻一片碧绿，生长非常旺盛。很多农民正在“烧包子”，到处烟雾弥漫，毛主席问：“这种‘烧包子’是不是很普遍？”曾希圣同志说：“很普遍。”毛主席又问：“有什么作用？”曾希圣同志说：“主要是积肥、杀虫，还可以改良土壤。”毛主席说“还有深耕的作用。”毛主席沿途看到标语很多，墙上、树上、屋顶上、以至地上，田埂上，到处都有很生动的标语，而且很多地方有跃进门、宣传牌、宣传站，毛主席说：“宣传工作做得很好。”毛主席到合肥以后高兴地说：“沿途一望，生气蓬勃，肯定是有希望的，有大希望的。”
  办好人民公社妇女才能彻底解放
    毛主席在合肥期间还和许多妇女干部谈了话，在谈到妇女工作问题时，毛主席说：“如果每年每人没有一千斤、两千斤食粮，没有公共食堂，没有幸福院，托儿所，没有扫除文盲，没有进小学、中学、大学，妇女还不可能彻底解放。”毛主席指出，只有办好人民公社，才是妇女彻底解放的道路。人民公社实行工资制、供给制，工资发给每个人，而不发给家长，妇女、青年一定很高兴，这样就破除了家长制，破除了资产阶级法权思想。
    毛主席在安徽各地视察期间和广大群众亲切会见。在安庆、舒城、合肥、芜湖、马鞍山等地和毛主席会见的群众约有四十万人。这些人中有工人、农民、解放军官兵、学校师生、机关干部，有白发苍苍的老人，也有带着红领巾的少先队员。他们认为能够看到伟大的人民领袖毛主席，是永世难忘的幸福，也是极其巨大的鼓舞。他们都为毛主席的健康而高兴。
    毛主席在安徽各地视察，给广大群众和干部带来无穷的力量。毛主席视察马鞍山钢铁厂以后，当天夜里该厂就有许多人写了大跃进的决心书，有许多人不肯下班，一直干到第二天上午还不肯休息。马鞍山钢铁厂已经决定在最近期间将生铁日产量由现在的一千一百吨提高到二千吨。省委钢铁厂正在加紧三、四号高炉的建筑安装工作，争取国庆节前后投入生产。省委钢铁厂还决定增加七对十三立方公尺的高炉，争取在十一月上旬建成投入生产。安徽第一纺织厂一千多女工看到毛主席以后，一致提出要用加紧生产的实际行动回答毛主席的关怀，清纱车间甲班工人原来平均每人看车八台，19日提高到每人看车十六台。合肥矿山机器厂电焊工、省劳动模范瞿庭蓓和全组工人正在为高炉焊接围管，原来一班一天只能焊两个半，会见了毛主席以后，她们提出一天要焊三个半，结果19日这一天她们一班一气焊了十六个。安庆一中在毛主席视察以后，当天晚上即召开座谈会，大家一致提出要鼓起更大干劲，力争上游，更好地做好勤工俭学工作，座谈会上决定再加速建成一座一点五立方公尺的小高炉，把生铁产量翻一番，到年底保证生产生铁一百吨，争取一百二十吨。现在，安徽各地群众和干部正以新的跃进高潮回答毛主席的关怀。（附图片）
