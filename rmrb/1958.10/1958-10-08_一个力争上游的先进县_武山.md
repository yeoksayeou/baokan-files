    A Progressive County Striving for Advancement - Wushan
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jiwei
    What exactly constitutes striving for advancement? I always wanted to find a relatively complete and prominent example. During this 16,000-li trip to Shaanxi and Gansu, I saw inspiring examples of striving for advancement everywhere. However, in terms of the overall leadership work of a county, Wushan County in Gansu Province truly deserves to be called a progressive county striving for advancement. It's been over a month since I left Wushan County, and I'm presenting here what I saw at that time.
    In Wushan, people beam with joy at the mention of advanced things, constantly caring about the "satellites launching into the sky" and large-scale high yields across the country with fervent hearts. They continuously send people to learn advanced experiences from various places, launching a fiery upsurge of catching up with the advanced and striving for the upstream throughout the county, doing everything possible to cultivate, consolidate, and improve advanced models, striving to make them spread from points to areas, blooming everywhere.
  Several breakthroughs in one township, several breakthroughs in one commune
    Cultivating various vivid role models
    Several red flags that have attracted national attention are flying over the land of Wushan: Dengjiabao's experience in soil and water conservation, Dongliangshan's experience in diverting water up the mountain and high-altitude irrigation, and Daliushu Village's experience in hygiene work. County-wide red flags are even more prevalent in every sector. The various departments and sections of the county-level organs have plans and focus on cultivating various model examples. The call for "one breakthrough per township, one breakthrough per commune" has been changed to "several breakthroughs in one township, several breakthroughs in one commune." "Relying on models, guiding the overall, holding high the red flag, constantly revolutionizing" is a successful experience that the Wushan County Party Committee has effectively implemented for several years.
    Cultivating excellent models and achieving results that ordinary people consider difficult not only breaks superstition and encourages the courage to think and act but also cultivates a group of excellent cadres who can closely integrate theory and practice. Because leading cadres at all levels in Wushan frequently went deep into key areas to create models, they have explored a set of relatively practical experiences. No matter which task is carried out, the Party Committee can not only explain the principles to the masses but also present vivid examples, plant red flags marking the upstream, and point out the road to the upstream. Therefore, the models here are not outstanding individuals but good seeds that have been carefully hatched. The "Dengjiabao Movement," which focuses on soil and water conservation, has seen the emergence of 504 "Dengjiabao" of all sizes, almost entirely controlling the soil erosion of the 1,814 square kilometers of mountainous land in the county that should be subject to soil and water conservation. Among the 1,371 natural villages in the county, 1,135 villages, although not fully meeting the strict and thorough hygiene standards of Daliushu Village, can basically be called Daliushu-type hygiene villages. The "Dongliangshan Movement" that is currently underway is even more impressive. The "Five Liang" and "Six Dragons" ten large canals in the style of the Dongliang Canal will make 90% of the county's mountainous area irrigated, turning the cultivated land on high mountains at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,200 meters into irrigable land that can be cultivated by machines.
  Transforming the most backward into the most advanced
  Preventing arrogance and allowing models to reach new heights
    Cultivating models requires effort and perseverance. Once they have selected an object for cultivating a model, they are determined to succeed and not fail. After the model has been successfully cultivated, they do everything possible to make it a red flag that does not fade. They see the failure of cultivating models as a major shortcoming. When the work of Daliushu Village initially suffered setbacks, the comrades of the work team suggested that the village's environment was particularly dirty and there were particularly many diseases, making it unsuitable as a model village for creating hygiene standards. They planned to select another object with better conditions for cultivation. The County Party Committee severely criticized and corrected this thought of wavering and retreating in the face of difficulties, emphasizing the special significance of transforming the most backward into the most advanced. After persistent efforts over the past three or four years, they have finally transformed a village with a particularly dirty environment and many diseases into a village that is as hygienic as a hospital and as beautiful as a garden. This is a particularly convincing model for inspiring the people of the county to carry out a hygiene campaign.
    After becoming a model, will they necessarily become arrogant and complacent? Some people are prone to arrogance and complacency after victory, especially after receiving honors, but as long as the Party organization can continue to strengthen ideological and political work and as long as it can educate cadres and the masses with the principles of continuous revolution, the red flag will not fade and will continue to move forward, always striving for advancement. Some comrades at the Dengjiabao Soil and Water Conservation Station once felt that "Dengjiabao's historical mission has been completed, and the work of the Soil and Water Conservation Station should come to an end." The County Party Committee inspected Dengjiabao's work and criticized this thinking of being satisfied with the achievements that had been made. It studied ways to improve Dengjiabao, proposing, "We cannot stand still; we must move forward with great strides!" "Dengjiabao should reach a new level!" Since June, the County Party Committee has organized more than 25,000 people in three major battles in Dengjiabao. Their battle slogans are: "With the spirit of communism, draw the most beautiful picture on the land of Dengjiabao!" "Turn high mountains into terraced fields, fill deep gullies to plant orchards, order barren mountains to grow green trees, and order the land to catch up with the south!" The heroic goals are: "Steep slopes become flat land, small plots of land are connected into large pieces; carrying on shoulders is all put down, and iron oxen plow happily in the fields; pepper and walnuts are planted all over the mountains, and apples and grapes fill the villages; grain production increases by 20 million, and happy lives last forever." In this way, in the struggle to conquer nature through splitting mountains and controlling gullies and machine-cultivating mountainous land, Dengjiabao has once again established a new direction for the people of the county, and another mass soil and water conservation movement is surging in Wushan. The goal of this movement is to turn more than 80% of the steep slopes into large plots of farmland with a slope of less than five degrees and hundreds of acres in size. In mid-August, the "Wei River Control Army," composed of more than 100,000 people, began a great socialist construction on the high mountains on both sides of the Wei River.
  Learning from wherever there is advancement
    Pursuing wherever the upstream is
    Many leading comrades of the Wushan County Party Committee often have their eyes on all sides and their ears listening to all directions. In order to accelerate the various constructions in Wushan, many cadres in the county have developed a habit of enthusiastically learning from all parts of the country. Cadres at all levels and many people often read newspapers. The county has subscribed to a total of 21,908 copies of various newspapers. Each department of the county-level organs has several "informants" and "researchers" who are specially responsible for collecting and studying new creations and new experiences from all over the country, learning from wherever there is advancement, and pursuing wherever the upstream is. In the past two years, this county with a population of 280,000 has sent a total of 333 groups (a total of 9,567 people, including 435 department-level cadres) to visit and study in various parts of the country, and many important experiences have been blossoming and bearing fruit here. When they saw the news in the newspaper about cadres in Hong'an County planting experimental fields, they immediately sent three people to visit and study. This year, more than 4,000 cadres in the county have planted more than 14,000 mu of experimental fields. These experimental fields, from land preparation and sowing to harvesting, are all done by cadres themselves. During the Great Leap Forward, cadres at all levels further developed planting experimental fields into planting "high-yield insurance fields." Later, planting high-yield insurance fields was further developed into each cadre and mass in the county planting one mu of high-yield insurance field. In August, the movement to plant high-yield insurance fields was developed into the "Creating the World's Number One Field Movement." This fully reflects the spirit of Wushan County's cadres and masses striving for advancement.
    If others are advanced, we should learn from them; if we are advanced, should we stop learning from others? Wushan has created excellent results in many tasks. In recent years, people from all over the country have continuously come to Wushan to visit and study. The Wushan County Party Committee often educates cadres and the masses throughout the county to seize the opportunity and humbly learn from those who come to Wushan to visit. Wushan's soil and water conservation and water conservancy work has been done relatively well. More than 20,000 people have come to Dengjiabao to visit and study alone. However, Wushan is not satisfied with its achievements in this area and pays special attention to learning advanced experiences from all over the country in this area. Among the 333 visits and studies involving a total of 9,567 people, the most people who visited and studied soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction numbered 185 times for a total of 5,500 people.
  Grasping the advanced on one hand and grasping weaknesses on the other
    Grasping the backward links in the advanced aspects
    This spirit of preventing complacency is also manifested in the fact that the County Party Committee often pays attention to its weaknesses, grasping the advanced on one hand and grasping the backward on the other, and also grasping the backward parts in the advanced aspects. The focus of Wushan's sending people to visit and study in various parts of the country, second only to soil and water conservation, is industrial construction, with 74 visits totaling 2,373 people. These people were almost all sent out after the summer of this year because the County Party Committee felt that it had less experience in this area and its development was slower, and it was determined to catch up vigorously. For the "Wei River Control Army," this is an advanced construction team armed with the spirit of communism. However, by mid-August, carrying on shoulders was still common on major construction sites such as Dengjiabao and Dongliangshan. The County Party Committee has already seen this backward link from this advanced project and is determined to immediately correct this shortcoming, resolutely not allowing advanced projects to still generally use backward production tools. On the construction site of Dongliangshan, not only have many high-line transportations been installed, but also efforts are being made to build a 450-meter-long electric cable car with a slope of 35 degrees in early October, using advanced mechanized and electrified production tools to promote the reform movement of production tools throughout the construction site. This method of catching up head-on is also a clear sign of Wushan's striving for advancement.
    In recent years, the Central Committee, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, and the Tianshui Prefectural Party Committee have also made great efforts to cultivate and improve Wushan, this advanced model. This time, the Third National Soil and Water Conservation Conference was held in Wushan on September 2nd, which will play a huge role in summarizing and improving Wushan's experience and in guiding and inspiring Wushan's revolutionary enthusiasm. Comrade Chen Zhengren, Director of the Soil and Water Conservation Committee of the State Council, said in his opening speech, "Why is this conference being held in Wushan? Everyone knows that Gansu has produced an advanced model of soil and water conservation like Dengjiabao, especially a glorious banner like Dongliang Canal diverting water up the mountain, which is famous throughout the country." He Jili, Secretary General of the Soil and Water Conservation Committee, said: "Wushan Dengjiabao is one of the most outstanding good examples of soil and water conservation in the country and also the best and most practical soil and water conservation university in the country." Soviet soil and water conservation expert Zaslavsky also said after visiting Dengjiabao: "I have heard a lot about the good reputation of Dengjiabao in the past, but what we see today far exceeds what we have heard and imagined. This is a very good example of comprehensively transforming nature." What a tremendous encouragement these praises will be to the people of Wushan!

    一个力争上游的先进县—武山
    本报记者　胡季委
    究竟怎样才算力争上游？总想找一个比较完整的突出典型。这次在陕西和甘肃“跑马看花”的一万六千里行程中，力争上游的动人事例处处都是。但是，就一个县的整个领导工作来说，甘肃省的武山县，真配得上是一个力争上游的先进县。我离开武山县已经一个多月了，这里介绍的是我当时所看见的情况。
    在武山，一听先进事物就喜笑颜开，经常怀着一团火热的心情关怀着全国各地“卫星上天”和大面积丰产，不断派人到各地去学习先进经验，干劲冲天地在全县掀起赶先进争上游的热潮，尽一切力量来培养、巩固和提高先进典型，努力使它们由点到面，遍地开花。
  一乡几突出一社几突出
    培养各种活生生的榜样
    飘扬在武山的土地上，有几面引起全国重视的红旗：邓家堡的水土保持的经验，东梁山引水上山和高山灌溉的经验，大柳树村的卫生工作经验。全县性的红旗，更是行行都有。县级机关的各部各科都有计划有重点地培养了各种各样的模范典型，“一乡一突出、一社一突出”的号召已经改为“一乡几突出、一社几突出”了。“依靠典型，指导全面，高举红旗，不断革命”，就是武山县委几年来行之有效的一条成功经验。
    培养优秀的典型，作出一般人认为难于办到的成绩，不只可以破除迷信、鼓舞敢想敢干的勇气，而且可以培养出一批能够把理论和实际密切结合的优秀干部。武山各级领导干部，由于经常深入重点创造了典型，他们就摸索出一套比较切合实际的经验，无论开展那一项工作，党委都可以在群众面前既能讲出道理，也能拿出活生生的榜样，插上标志上游的红旗，指出驶向上游的道路。所以这里的典型并不是鹤立鸡群，而是努力孵育的良种鸡。以保持水土为内容的“邓家堡运动”，已经出现了大大小小的“邓家堡”五百零四个，把全县应该进行水土保持的一千八百一十四平方公里山地的水土流失几乎全部控制起来了。在全县一千三百七十一个自然村中，有一千一百三十五个村虽然没有完全达到大柳树村那种严格周密的卫生标准，但是基本上已经可以叫作大柳树型的卫生村庄。正在开展着的“东梁山运动”更是声势浩大，东梁渠式的“五梁”和“六龙”十一条大渠，将使占全县土地90％的山区水利化，要把海拔二千到三千二百公尺高的高山上的耕地，变成可以进行机械耕作的水地。
  把最落后培养成最先进
  防止骄傲让典型更上一层楼
    培养典型，要费心血，也要毅力。他们在培养典型的对象一经选定以后，就下定只能成功不能失败的决心；典型培养成功以后，又千方百计使它们成为不褪色的红旗。他们把培养典型的失败看成很大的缺点。当大柳树村的工作初步受到挫折的时候，工作组的同志提出这个村环境特别脏、疾病特别多，不适宜作创造卫生模范村的典型，打算另外选择一个条件好的培养对象。县委严厉批评和纠正了这种在困难面前动摇退缩的思想，强调把最落后培养成最先进的特殊意义。经过最近三四年来坚韧不拔地努力，终于把一个环境特别脏、疾病特别多的村子建设成为一个像医院那样卫生、像花园那样美丽的村子，这对鼓舞全县人民开展卫生运动，是一个特别有说服力的模范。
    成了模范典型以后，是不是一定就会骄傲自满呢？一些人在胜利以后，特别是在得到荣誉以后，是容易产生骄傲自满情绪的，但是只要党组织能够继续加强思想政治工作，只要能够用不断革命的道理教育干部和群众，就可以使红旗不褪色，而且不断向前，永远力争上游。邓家堡水土保持工作站有的同志曾经感到“邓家堡的历史任务完成了，水土保持站的工作应当结束了”，县委检查了邓家堡的工作，批评了这种满足于已得成绩的思想。研究了提高邓家堡的办法，提出“不能原地踏步，必须大踏步向前”！“邓家堡应该更上一层楼！”从6月开始，县委已经前后组织了二万五千多人三次大战邓家堡，他们的战斗口号是：“以共产主义的精神，在邓家堡的土地上画最美丽的图画！”“翻转高山成梯田，填平深沟种果园，吆喝荒山长绿树，命令土地赶江南！”英雄们的奋斗目标是：“高山陡坡变平川，小块土地连成片；担背肩挑齐放下，地里铁牛耕得欢；花椒胡桃栽满山，苹果葡萄满庄园；粮食增产二千万，幸福生活永无边。”这样，在劈山治沟和山地机耕等制服自然的斗争中，邓家堡又向全县人民树立了新的方向，又一次群众性的水土保持运动正在武山风起云涌地开展起来了。把80％以上的陡坡地，变成五度以下的、百亩连片的大块耕地，就是这次运动的努力目标。8月中旬，十多万人组成的“治渭大军”，在渭河两岸的高山上开始进行着伟大的社会主义建设。
  哪里有先进就向哪里学
    哪里是上游就向哪里追
    武山县委的很多领导同志经常是眼观四侧耳听八方的。为了加快武山的各项建设，县里的很多干部都培养出一种向全国各地热情学习的习惯，各级干部和很多群众都经常读报，全县共订各种报纸二万一千九百零八份。县级机关各部门设有几个“情报员”兼“研究员”，专门负责搜集和研究全国各地的新创造和新经验，那里有先进就到那里去学习，那里是上游就向那里追赶。最近两年来，这个二十八万人口的县份，共派出三百三十三个小组（共九千五百六十七人，其中科部长干部四百三十五人）到全国各地参观学习，有很多重要的经验已经在这里开花结果。当他们从报上看到红安县干部种试验田的消息以后，立即派了三个人去参观学习。全县四千多干部今年共种一万四千多亩试验田，这些试验田从整地、播种、到收割，都由干部亲自动手。在大跃进中，各级干部更把种试验田发展成为种“丰产保险田”，以后这个种丰产保险田又发展成为全县干部和群众一人种一亩丰产保险田，8月又把种丰产保险田运动发展成为“创造天下第一田运动”。这就充分反映出武山县的干部和群众力争上游的精神。
    人家先进，就向人家学习；自己先进，是不是就不再向人家学习了呢？武山在好些工作上创造了优越的成绩，几年来全国各地不断有人到武山参观学习。武山县委经常教育全县干部和群众抓着机会，向来武山参观的人虚心求教。武山的水土保持和水利工作是作得比较好的，单是到邓家堡来参观学习的人就有两万多人，但是武山并不满足于自己在这方面的成绩，而且特别注意学习全国这方面的先进经验，在派出参观学习的三百三十三次共九千五百六十七人中，参观学习水土保持和水利建设的人却最多，有一百八十五次共五千五百人。
  一手抓先进一手抓弱点
    在先进方面抓落后环节
    这种防止自满的精神，还表现在县委常常注意自己的弱点，一手抓先进，一手抓落后，而且还在先进的方面抓落后的部分。武山派人到全国各地去参观学习的重点，仅次于水土保持的是工业建设，有七十四次一共二千三百七十三人，这些人几乎大都在今年夏季以后派出去的，因为县委感到在这方面经验较少，发展较慢，决心猛力赶上去。对于“治渭大军”，这是以共产主义精神武装起来的先进的建设队伍，但是到8月中旬，在邓家堡和东梁山等主要工地上，仍然普遍是肩挑背背，县委已经从这个先进的工程中看出这个落后的环节，决心立即改正这个缺点，决不让先进的工程仍然普遍使用落后的生产工具。在东梁山的工地上，不只安装了很多高线运输，而且争取在十月初修好坡度三十五度的长四百五十公尺的一条电力缆车，用先进的机械化电气化的生产工具来推动整个工地生产工具的改革运动。这种迎头赶上的办法，也是武山力争上游的一个鲜明的标志。
    几年来，中央、甘肃省委和天水地委，对于培养和提高武山这个先进典型，也作了很大的努力。这次，全国第三次水土保持会议9月2日在武山召开，对总结和提高武山的经验，对指导和鼓舞武山的革命干劲，都会起巨大的作用。国务院水土保持委员会主任陈正人同志在开幕词中说：“这次会议为什么在武山召开呢？大家知道甘肃出现了像邓家堡这样的水土保持的先进典型，特别是出现了像东梁渠引水上山这样闻名全国的光辉旗帜。”水土保持委员会的秘书长何基礼说：“武山邓家堡是全国水土保持最突出的好典型之一，也是全国最好最实际的水土保持大学。”苏联水土保持专家扎斯拉夫斯基在参观了邓家堡以后也说：“关于邓家堡的好名誉，我过去听了很多，但是，我们今天看到的，远远超过了听到的和想像到的。这是一个非常好的全面改造自然的典型。”这些称赞对武山人民将是多么巨大的鼓舞啊！
