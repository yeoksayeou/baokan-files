    Chengpu Autonomous County Party Secretary Leads Masses in a Crash Program: Full Year's Task Completed in Five Days
    (Our dispatch) The Chengpu Miao Autonomous County in Hunan Province's timber production task this year is 180,000 cubic meters, a threefold increase over last year; Nan bamboo is 1.6 million, an increase of 2.5 times over last year. However, the county has only 110,000 people, and only 19,000 male laborers. It is also difficult to rely on support from other counties. After analyzing this situation, the county Party committee immediately took emergency measures, organizing 10,000 laborers to launch a vigorous timber production crash program. Starting in early September, they spent two days preparing, one day going up the mountains, and after five days and nights of hard work, they completed the entire logging task.
    In order to ensure the completion of the timber production task, the Party Secretary took personal command, mobilizing the entire Party and all the people. The county Party committee established a timber production command, with the county Party secretary as the commander. Townships established logging squadrons, led by the industry secretary as the captain; cooperatives established logging teams, led by the branch secretary as the team leader.
    When logging bamboo and timber, they implemented six fixings (fixing personnel, fixing time, fixing quantity, fixing construction site, fixing inspection, fixing rewards) and launched a red flag competition at the construction sites.

    城步自治县书记挂帅群众突击
    全年任务五天完成
    本报讯　湖南城步苗族自治县今年木材生产任务是十八万立方公尺，比去年增加三倍；楠竹一百六十万根，比去年增加二点五倍，但全县只有十一万人，男劳动力只有一万九千人，依靠外县支援也有困难。该县县委分析了这个情况，立即采取紧急措施，组织了一万个劳动力，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的木材生产突击运动，从9月初起，两天准备，一天上山，苦战五昼夜全部完成砍伐任务。
    为了保证完成木材生产任务，书记亲自挂帅，全党全民动员，县委设立木材生产指挥部，县委书记任指挥长；乡成立采伐中队，由工业书记任队长；社成立采伐小组，由支书任小组长。
    在采伐竹木时，实行六定（定人、定时、定数、定工地、定检查、定奖励），开展工地红旗竞赛。
