In the Qitang team of the Shangyou People's Commune in Baise County, Guangxi, after the summer harvest and planting, more than 60% of the labor force was transferred to engage in steel production and water conservancy construction, while the grain production targets for agriculture were repeatedly increased. Therefore, the team cadres were constantly thinking: "Can we do well in steel, grain production, and water conservancy construction at the same time?" "Are we going to be intimidated by the difficulty of insufficient labor?" However, people whose minds have been liberated are unwilling to give negative answers to these questions. Therefore, the final answer is: "We must have the steel and grain marshals promoted at the same time, and water conservancy construction must also be done well at the same time." With this confidence, all the cadres in the team began to think of further solutions. The production team leader was very familiar with the situation of the team. He calculated that there were more than one hundred elderly people in the team. If these old grandfathers and grandmothers were organized and assigned some light work, many main laborers could be replaced. This method was proposed and immediately received the approval of other team cadres, so they went to connect with the elderly people in different ways.

Old But Vigorous vs. Old and Useless

Organizing the elderly to participate in collective labor was not a simple task. When team cadres were brewing to connect with the elderly to participate in collective labor, they encountered difficulties. Some elderly people said, "Old age is useless, what can we do!" But in the process of connecting, some old grandfathers and grandmothers said, "Yes! This is a very good idea, why didn't you propose it earlier!" The team cadres felt that these two different reactions could be debated. The debate began, and many old grandfathers brought out historical old heroes, from Huang Zhong, who still wielded an eighty-pound broadsword at the age of seventy, to Fang Heming, the Red Army regiment commander who returned to his hometown to work as a labor model. People talked endlessly about the past and the present; at the same time, the meeting summarized two advantages of elderly people participating in collective labor: 1. The work assigned is light work, which is not only not tiring, but can relax muscles and promote blood circulation; 2. Elderly people have production experience and can pass it on to the younger generation through collective labor. After the debate, the opinions tended to be consistent—"It is not that old age is useless, but that old age is vigorous." After the meeting, the team cadres organized the elderly to visit the Baise Sugar Factory and the Chengbi Reservoir, three miles away, and they were greatly moved. Several elderly people wrote their own folk songs in the sugar factory and on the construction site. Among them, Lu Zhangxin, who was in his sixties, wrote in a folk song: "The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, everyone must be energetic, the elderly cannot lag behind, but also strive for the first place on the red list." Seventy-five-year-old Grandpa Yang Wenguang said, "I have been ignoring everything outside the window for seventeen years. What has accompanied me for seventeen years is smoke and the cries of children. If you hadn't organized me to visit, I would really have been isolated from the world."

What Can the Elderly Do

After mobilizing the elderly, the team assigned work according to their physical strength and technical skills. There were a total of one hundred and twenty-eight elderly people over the age of sixty in this team. Except for some who were physically weak, there were still one hundred and eighteen who could do some light work. The team divided them into ten "Huang Zhong Groups": The first group was the pig-raising group, composed of twenty-three people, who were only responsible for raising pigs and planting feed, and not for chopping firewood; the second group was the vegetable-growing group, composed of thirteen people, contracted to grow eighteen mu of vegetable land; the third group was the childcare group, composed of twenty-three people, responsible for taking care of seventy-six children; the fourth group was the carpentry group, composed of eight people, responsible for repairing farm tools; the fifth group was the cooking group, composed of fourteen people, responsible for adding firewood and lighting fires in various canteens; the sixth group was the mill group, composed of nine people, responsible for controlling the water and adding grinding in each water mill and animal-powered mill; the seventh group was the cattle-raising group, composed of six people, grazing a total of sixty-nine cattle; the eighth group was the fish-raising group, composed of six people, taking care of eight fish ponds; the ninth group was the village-edge fertilizer accumulation group, specializing in picking up fertilizer from the village head alleys and responsible for cleaning the village; the tenth group was the medical group, composed of seven elderly people with medical experience. These groups started working immediately after they were established. These ten groups have done a lot of outstanding work in the past two months. For example, the old grandmothers of the childcare group not only took good care of the children, but also made more than a dozen kinds of toys for the children to play with; the carpentry group repaired eight ox carts, made six all-purpose harrows, a corn seeder, and ten pairs of buckets; the village-edge fertilizer accumulation group not only did a good job in village sanitation, but also accumulated two thousand dan of cattle manure.

Care for the Elderly

After the elderly participated in collective production, the team gave them some material care, such as giving them some pocket money to buy tobacco, and regularly giving them a "nutritional meal" in the canteen (that is, adding a little pork to ordinary meals); and often caring about their cold and heat, making the elderly feel warm. Therefore, socialist labor competitions were also carried out among the elderly, and regular evaluations were made. This made everyone feel happy, and many miracles appeared in production. For example, Lu Binglian, who is sixty-eight years old, cultivated a vegetable field with a yield of 100,000 jin per mu, which is now growing very well; the twelve pigs in the pig-raising group only weighed 895 jin two months ago, but now they have increased sharply to 2,506 jin, one of which is already more than 300 jin; the elderly in the pig-raising group have also invented "artificial distiller's grains" (that is, feed fermentation) based on their own experience.

Labor Transforms from a Means of Survival to an Element of Happy Living

The labor enthusiasm of the elderly is growing, and some elderly people say, "Now as long as I am idle for a while, I feel bored." Xiu Wen's mother, who is in her sixties, and Lun Zhong's mother, who is seventy-two years old, launched a labor competition, the condition being to see who takes good care of the children. Lu Binglian, who is sixty-eight years old, secretly learned to operate a double-wheeled double-share plow, wanting to show off his power in front of the young people. After these deeds spread, the young and middle-aged people were greatly moved, and people were working selflessly. Labor—has transformed from a means of survival to an element of happy living.

    人愈老心愈红
    潘乃文
    广西百色县上游人民公社七塘队在夏收夏种结束后，抽调了60％多的劳动力去搞钢铁生产和水利建设，同时农业生产的粮食指标又一再加码。于是队干部们成天在思考着：“能不能使钢铁、粮食生产和水利建设同时搞好？”“难道我们就被劳动力不足的困难吓倒吗？”可是，思想获得了解放的人们对这些问题是不愿意作否定的答案的，因此，最终的答案是：“硬要钢铁、粮食元帅同时升帐，水利建设也要同时搞好。”有了这个信心，队内的全体干部就开始在进一步想办法了。生产队长是很熟悉本队情况的，他计算了一下本队有一百多个老年人，如果把这些老爷爷、老奶奶组织起来，分给他们一些轻活，就可以替换出许多主要劳动力。这个办法提出来后，立即得到了其他队干部的同意，于是他们就分途去串连了。
    老当益壮和老来无用
    把老年人组织起来，参加集体劳动，并不是件简单的工作。队干部们在酝酿串连老人们参加集体劳动时，遇到了困难。有些老人说：“老来无用，能干什么！”但在串连中也有一些老爷爷、老奶奶这么说：“是啊！这是个挺好的主意，为什么你们不早提出来呢！”这两种不同的反映，队干们觉得可以组织辩论一下。辩论会开始了，很多老爷爷把历史上的老英雄搬出来了，从黄忠七十岁还使八十斤的大刀一直到红军团长方和明还乡作劳模，人们在滔滔不绝地谈今说古；同时会上还总结了两点老年人参加集体劳动的好处：1．分给干的是轻活，不仅不劳累，相反可以舒筋活血；2．老年人有生产经验，可以通过集体劳动，传授给后生。辩论后，意见趋于一致——“不是老来无用，而是老当益壮”。会后，队干部组织了老年人到三里以外的百色糖厂和澄碧水库去参观，他们受到了很大的感动。好几个老人在糖厂内和工地上写出了自己创作的山歌，其中年届六旬的陆章新的一首山歌上面写道：“工农生产大跃进，人人都要鼓干劲，老人不能甘落后，也争红榜第一名。”七十五岁的杨文光爷爷说：“我已经是十七年来两耳不闻窗外事了，十七年伴我的是烟火和小孩的哭声，不是你们组织我来参观，真的我就与世隔绝了。”
    老年人可以干些什么
    在把老年人发动起来之后，队里根据老年人的体力和技术情况，分配了工作。这个队年在六十岁以上的老年人共有一百二十八人，除了有些身体衰弱的外，能干些轻活的还有一百一十八人。队里把他们分成了十个“黄忠组”：第一组是养猪小组，由二十三人组成，这些人只管饲养猪和种饲料地，不管打柴；第二组是种菜小组，由十三人组成，包种菜地十八亩；第三组是托儿小组，由二十三人组成，负责看七十六个小孩；第四组是木工组，由八人组成，负责修理农具；第五组是炊事小组，由十四人组成，到各个膳堂负责添柴生火；第六组是磨房小组，由九人组成，分别到各水碾房和兽力磨房，负责掌握放水添磨；第七组是养牛组，由六人组成，共放耕牛六十九头；第八组是养鱼小组，由六人组成，看管八口鱼塘；第九组是村边积肥组，专门拾捡村头巷尾的肥料和负责村内的清洁工作；第十组是医疗组，由七个有医务经验的老人组成。这些组建立后，立即开始工作。这十个组，在两个月来，做出了很多出色的工作。如托儿组的老奶奶们除带好孩子们外，并且做出了十几种玩具，供小孩们玩耍；木工组修整了八架牛车，制出了六架万能耙、一架玉米播种机、十对水桶；村边积肥组除搞好村内卫生工作外，积了二千担牛粪尿。
    对老人们的照顾
    老年人们在参加集体生产后，队内对他们给予了一些物质照顾，如发给他们一些买烟草的零钱，定时在食堂内给他们一顿“营养餐”（即在普通饭菜内添上一点猪肉）；并且经常关心他们的寒暑，使老人们感到温暖。因此老人们中也开展社会主义劳动竞赛，定时评比。这样，使每个老人都精神愉快，生产中出现很多奇迹。如六十八岁的陆炳连，培育了一亩亩产十万斤蔬菜的菜地，现在生长非常好；养猪组的十二头猪在两个月前只有八百九十五斤，现在骤增到二千五百零六斤，其中有一头已有三百多斤；养猪组的老人们，还根据自己的经验，发明了“人工酒糟”（即饲料发酵）。
    劳动从谋生手段变为乐生要素
    老人们的劳动热情正在增长，有的老人说：“现在只要闲一阵，就感到闷的慌。”六十多岁的秀文妈和七十二岁的伦中妈开展了劳动竞赛，条件是看谁把孩子们带得好。六十八岁的陆炳连偷偷地学习操纵双轮双铧犁，想在青年人面前抖擞一下威风。这些事迹传开后，青壮年们受到了很大的感动，人们都在忘我的劳动。劳动——从谋生的手段变为了乐生的要素。　（原载“广西农村”）（附图片）
