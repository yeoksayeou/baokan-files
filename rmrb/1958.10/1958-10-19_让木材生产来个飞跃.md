Let Timber Production Take a Great Leap Forward
Vice Minister of Forestry, Zhou Junming

Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are building our motherland with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and a heroic pace of one day equaling twenty years. Significant achievements have been made on all construction fronts.

In 1958, China's timber production, like all national construction undertakings, achieved tremendous success. According to statistics from January to early October, China's timber production has completed 71.64% of the annual Great Leap Forward plan, powerfully supporting China's various construction projects. These achievements are mainly due to the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, putting politics in command, implementing the mass line, and the soaring communist consciousness of the broad masses of workers, who have displayed tremendous enthusiasm. In particular, since the decentralization of enterprises, under the active leadership of local Party committees, timber production has been continuously pushed to new heights, and a mass movement of technological innovation centered on the reform of tools has emerged.

In the technological innovation movement, the inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the workers and masses are like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and production success stories continue to pour in, which is inspiring. For example, the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area in Inner Mongolia adopted a motor vehicle train-style timber transport method, which increased transportation efficiency by dozens of times. The Pingxiang County Forestry Work Station in Jiangxi Province created a non-powered automated bamboo chip aerial transport line, which automatically loads and unloads, and automatically returns empty, increasing efficiency fifty times compared to manual labor. The Liuyang County Forestry Bureau in Hunan Province recently organized more than 1,100 people to fight hard for five days and nights, chiseling through 800 meters of rocky mountains, crossing nearly 30-meter-long deep valleys, and erecting a 12-li-long wooden rail road, opening up new avenues for the development of remote forest areas in high mountains. Because the broad masses of workers have launched a technological revolution, they have further promoted the continuous great leap forward in timber production. So far, the Yituli River, Tuli River, and Gan River Forestry Bureaus in Inner Mongolia, Jianghua and Qiyang in Hunan, Ninghua in Fujian, and Meixi in Heilongjiang have completed their annual timber production tasks three to eight months ahead of schedule, setting advanced banners for national timber production.

Although timber production has made great achievements, due to the rapid development of various construction projects, timber production is far from meeting the needs of various construction projects; especially with the rapid development of the coal industry, pit props are in short supply.

In order to overfulfill the timber task, first of all, we must, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee on running enterprises by the whole Party and the whole people, launch a mass timber production upsurge throughout the country. Many provinces and regions have already vigorously launched this. For example, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee decided to mobilize 500,000 people to go to the mountains to cut trees. Chengbu Miao Autonomous County in the province has a total population of only 110,000. Due to the leadership of the secretary, more than 10,000 laborers were mobilized, and the annual logging task was completed after five days and nights of hard work. Party committees at all levels in Guizhou took the lead, personally directing timber production, carrying out short-term surprise attacks, with the whole people cutting and transporting. The Tongzi Shixi District alone organized a production army of more than 13,000 people, who fought hard for seven days and three nights, producing 201,512 cubic meters of timber. Therefore, as long as we seize the favorable season for timber production in the fourth quarter and rapidly mobilize thousands of troops to go to the mountains to cut and transport, the timber production task can certainly be overfulfilled.

Secondly, it is necessary to actively purchase small, scattered trees in various provinces and autonomous regions, because the potential in this area is very large, especially in timber sales areas, where the amount of timber used is particularly large, and scattered timber should be actively purchased. As long as about half of the counties in the country purchase an average of 2,500 cubic meters per county, there will be more than 2.5 million cubic meters when concentrated. Using these timbers to support the coal mining industry can solve the problem of pit props for producing 100 million tons of coal. As long as timber purchasing units can do everything possible to tap the potential of sources of goods, it is certain that the task will be overfulfilled.

Third, give full play to the effectiveness of existing machinery, increase tools, and accelerate timber felling and transportation. At present, we already have a considerable number of modern felling and transportation tools in many enterprises, but a large part of the mechanical capacity has not been fully utilized, and production is unstable. This situation must be quickly reversed. Regions with conditions can take the approach of "people rest, but machines don't rest." From a national perspective, the proportion of mechanical production is small. How to implement the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, obtain materials locally, manufacture locally, and greatly increase the tools for felling, skidding, and transporting timber in timber production is an extremely important measure to accelerate timber production.

Fourth, continue to implement the mass technological revolution and cultural revolution. At present, the inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of forestry workers nationwide have great significance in solving the difficulties of insufficient manpower and lack of equipment, and in further improving labor productivity. The technological revolution and cultural revolution on the forestry front have brought a new look to production, increasing production efficiency several times or even dozens of times. We must encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and drive of the masses, and cherish their noble revolutionary qualities. Leaders at all levels must give enough importance and support to every invention, creation and rationalization proposal of the masses with an attitude responsible to the revolution, and timely summarize and promote effective advanced experiences. Use the thought of continuous revolution to direct production, use the advanced to drive the backward, and make the backward catch up with the advanced.

Finally, it needs to be especially pointed out that, to date, only about 40% of the annual total investment in capital construction has been completed, and the progress is extremely slow. Under the current situation of insufficient supply of some materials and equipment, we should ensure the completion of key construction projects that are critical to next year's production, taking into account the importance and urgency of each project, in order to create a material foundation for a greater leap forward in timber production next year.

There are only seventy days left from now to the end of the year. During this time, not only must we overfulfill this year's timber production tasks, but we must also do a series of preparatory work to welcome next year's new timber production tasks. Although the task is arduous, under the direct leadership of Party committees at all levels, we are fully confident and determined to bring about a leap forward development in China's timber production.

### 让木材生产来个飞跃

    让木材生产来个飞跃
    林业部副部长　周骏鸣
    全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，正以冲天的革命干劲，以一天等于二十年的豪迈步伐，建设我们的祖国。在各个建设战线都已取得了重大成就。
    1958年，我国木材生产和全国各项建设事业一样取得了巨大的成就。根据1月至10月上旬的统计，我国木材生产已完成年度跃进计划的71.64％，有力地支援了我国各项建设。这些成就主要是由于各级党委的正确领导，政治挂帅，贯彻群众路线，广大职工群众共产主义觉悟高涨，发挥了冲天的干劲所取得的。特别是企业下放以后，在地方党委的积极领导下，使木材生产不断推向新的高潮，出现了以改革工具为中心的技术革新的群众运动。
    在技术革新运动中，职工群众的发明创造、合理化建议如雨后春笋，生产捷报不断传来，令人振奋。如内蒙古大兴安岭林区采用汽车列车式运材法，运输效率提高数十倍。江西省萍乡县林业工作站创制的无动力自动化竹片架空运材道，自动装卸，自动回空，比人力提高效率五十倍。湖南省浏阳县林业局，最近组织一千一百多人，苦战五昼夜，凿开八百公尺的石山，越过了近三十公尺长的深谷，架设一条十二华里长的木轨车道，为开发高山偏远林区开辟了新的途径。由于广大职工展开了技术革命，就进一步推动木材生产不断向前跃进。到目前为止，内蒙古的伊图里河、图里河、甘河，湖南的江华、祁阳，福建的宁化，黑龙江的美溪等林业局，已提前三至八个月完成了全年木材生产任务，给全国木材生产树立了先进的旗帜。
    木材生产虽然已经取得很大成绩，但是由于各项建设的突飞猛进，木材生产远不能满足各项建设的需要；特别是煤炭工业的飞跃发展，坑木就供不应求。
    为了超额完成木材任务，首先我们要按照党中央全党全民办企业的精神，在全国范围内掀起一个群众性的木材生产高潮。现在有许多省区已经蓬勃展开。如湖南省委决定动员五十万人上山采伐，这个省城步苗族自治县全县只有十一万人，由于书记挂帅，动员了一万多劳力，苦战五昼夜，就完成了全年采伐任务。贵州各级党委挂帅，亲自指挥木材生产，进行短期突击，全民采伐，全民搬运，仅桐梓狮溪区就组织了一万三千多人的生产大军，苦战了七天三夜，生产木材二十万一千五百十二立方公尺。因此只要抓紧第四季度木材生产的有利季节，各地迅速动员千军万马上山采运，木材生产任务一定可以超额完成的。
    其次要积极收购各省、自治区小片的分散的林木，因为这方面的潜力很大，尤其是在木材销区，用材量特多，应积极收购零星木材。只要全国在一半左右的县内，平均每县收购二千五百立方公尺，集中起来就有二百五十万立方公尺以上，用这些木材来支援煤矿工业，就能解决生产一亿吨煤的坑木问题。只要木材收购单位能千方百计地发挥货源潜力，超额完成任务是有把握的。
    第三、充分发挥现有机械效能，增加工具，加快木材采伐和搬运。目前在我们许多企业内部已有相当数量现代化的采伐运输工具，但其中有很大部分机械能力还没有充分发挥出来，生产不稳定，必须迅速地扭转这种局面。有条件的地区可以采取人歇机械不歇的办法。从全国来看，机械生产的比重是小的，如何在木材生产中贯彻土洋并举，就地取材，就地制造，大力增加采伐、集材和运材的工具，是加快木材生产的一项极为重要的措施。
    第四、继续贯彻群众性的技术革命和文化革命。目前全国林业职工在生产中的发明创造和合理化建议对解决人力不足、设备缺乏的困难，对进一步提高劳动生产率具有重大意义。林业战线上的技术革命和文化革命，给生产上带来新的面貌，使生产效率几倍甚至几十倍的增长着。我们必须鼓励群众这种革命的热情和干劲，珍惜他们这种革命的高贵品质。各级领导上对群众每一件创造发明与合理化建议，必须以对革命负责的态度给予足够的重视和支持，对行之有效的先进经验要及时总结和推广。以不断革命的思想指挥生产，以先进带动落后，使落后赶上先进。
    最后特别需要指出的是：今年基本建设工作到目前为止，只完成年度总投资的40％左右，进度极为缓慢，在当前部分物资设备不足的情况下，应分别轻重缓急对明年生产带有关键性的建设项目保证完成，以便为明年木材生产更大的跃进创造物质基础。
    从现在到年底只有七十多天了，在这个时间内，不但要超额完成今年的木材生产任务，而且还要为迎接明年新的木材生产任务做好一系列的准备工作。任务虽然是繁重的，但在各级党委的直接领导下，我们完全有充分的信心和决心，使我国的木材生产来一个飞跃的发展。
