Congratulations on the Opening of the Autumn Chinese Export Commodities Fair
By Our Staff Commentator

The "1958 Autumn Chinese Export Commodities Fair" opened on the 15th in Guangzhou, our important port city. This is a larger-scale export commodities fair held by our country. We express our heartfelt congratulations on the holding of this trade fair and extend a warm welcome to trade representatives, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau who have been invited to participate in the trade fair.

In order to actively develop normal international trade exchanges and work with friends from various countries, China's foreign trade corporations have made many efforts in accordance with China's consistent principle of equality and mutual benefit in foreign trade, and have achieved great results, strengthening and developing economic ties between peoples of all countries. This export commodities fair held by our country is one of the important ways to develop normal trade between China and other countries. In the winter of 1956, the spring and autumn of 1957, and the spring of this year, China's foreign trade corporations have held four Chinese Export Commodities Fairs in Guangzhou. The experience of previous export commodities fairs shows that the method of combining trade and exhibition, face-to-face negotiation, and seeing samples to conclude transactions has been highly praised by trade representatives from all over the world. The spirit of friendly cooperation shown by China's foreign trade corporations and trade representatives from various countries in conducting business negotiations at the trade fair has also left a deep impression on many overseas trade representatives. Therefore, more and more trade representatives from all over the world and the Hong Kong and Macau regions come to participate in our country's trade fair, and the transaction volume achieved is also increasing. At each trade fair, China's foreign trade corporations and trade friends from various countries extensively exchanged views on trade issues of mutual interest, greatly deepened mutual understanding, enhanced friendship, and expanded friendly cooperation with trade representatives from various countries. Therefore, the Chinese Export Commodities Fair has also played a certain role in promoting the development of normal trade exchanges and friendly cooperation between our country and other countries.

With the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production in our country, especially the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production since this year, and the results of the large-scale cultural and technological revolution across the country, a richer material basis has been provided for our country's export commodities. In this trade fair, the number of commodities displayed and available for export has increased from more than 14,000 in the spring trade fair to more than 20,000. Although this cannot fully reflect the entire picture of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country, especially the rapid development of our country's scientific and technological level, it can be seen that our industry and agriculture are developing at a flying speed. Many commodities that our country could not produce in the past or were "embargoed" by certain countries against our country can now not only be produced for self-sufficiency, but also be provided for export, and the quality of many products has reached or exceeded international standards.

At the trade fair, in addition to negotiating export trade with trade representatives from various places, China's foreign trade corporations also selectively purchase materials that meet the needs of China's economic construction within the trade fair. Since the beginning of the founding of our country, we have advocated establishing and developing trade relations with any country in the world on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit, regardless of its social system or whether it has diplomatic relations with our country. This proposition is also consistent with our country's peaceful foreign policy. It is precisely because our country has consistently and unswervingly implemented this policy, and the increasingly rich material basis provided by the continuous development of our industrial and agricultural production, that our country's foreign trade has developed rapidly. Taking 1950 as 100, the total volume of import and export trade of our country was 156 in 1952 (the period of completing the economic recovery) and increased to 252 in 1957 (the period of completing the first five-year economic construction plan). At present, various aspects indicate that our country's foreign trade will have greater growth this year. Our country has not only increasingly consolidated and developed trade with countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, but also continuously developed trade with friendly countries in Asia and Africa, and trade with many Western countries has also been growing year by year. The number of countries and regions that have trade relations with our country has increased from 68 in 1956 to 94 in 1958. Since this year, in addition to continuing to consolidate and expand the import and export trade with countries and regions with which we already have trade relations, we have also established new trade relations with many countries and regions. The number of countries and regions in Asia and Africa that have trade relations with our country has increased from 32 in 1957 to 40 this year, which is of great benefit to enhancing mutual friendship and promoting the peaceful economic development of each other.

Since this year, the economic crisis of capitalist countries headed by the United States has been spreading throughout the capitalist world. The countries that have been most severely affected by the storm of the economic crisis are some countries that are economically dependent on the United States. The production of these countries is shrinking, and the number of unemployed people is constantly increasing. Business people in these countries are demanding the elimination of trade discrimination policies and calling for trade with our country. Therefore, developing normal international trade exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and eliminating all artificial trade barriers is not only our country's consistent proposition and desire, but also the common and urgent demand of people all over the world. Although the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan violated the wishes of the peace-loving Japanese people and strangled the Sino-Japanese trade that had been initially restored after the war, and the government authorities of certain countries adopted a hostile attitude towards our country, still clinging to the reactionary policy of "embargo" and "blockade" against our country that had long gone bankrupt; however, these not only cannot hinder the continuous development of our country's foreign trade and economic construction, on the contrary, our country's trade exchanges and friendly cooperation with the governments and peoples of other countries in the world are increasingly consolidated and developed, and our country's economic construction has achieved great success. It can be seen that imperialists and reactionaries cannot stop the development of world peace forces.

The holding of the Autumn Chinese Export Commodities Fair this year is timely and in line with the common aspirations of our country and the people of all countries in the world. We once again welcome trade representatives from all countries to come to visit and conduct transactions, and wish this trade fair greater success than ever before.

    祝秋季中国出口商品交易会开幕
    本报评论员
    “1958年秋季中国出口商品交易会”15日在我国的重要口岸广州市开幕了。这是我国一次规模更大的出口商品交易会。我们对这次交易会的举办表示衷心的祝贺，并对应邀前来参加交易的各国贸易界人士、侨胞及港澳同胞表示热烈的欢迎。
    我国各对外贸易公司根据我国一贯遵循的平等互利的对外贸易原则，为积极发展国际间正常贸易往来，同各国的朋友共同作了许多努力，并取得了很大成果，加强和发展了各国人民之间的经济联系，这次，我国举办的出口商品交易会，就是发展中国同其它国家间正常贸易的重要方式之一。在1956年的冬季、1957年的春、秋两季及今年春季，我国各对外贸易公司曾先后在广州市举办过四次中国出口商品交易会。历届出口商品交易会的情况表明，采用交易与展览相结合，当面洽谈，看样成交的方式，深得世界各地贸易界人士的赞许。我国各对外贸易公司在交易会中与各国贸易界人士进行业务谈判时双方所表现的友好合作的精神，也在不少的海外贸易界人士中留下了深刻的印象。因此世界各地及港澳地区前来参加我国交易会的贸易界人士愈来愈多，达成的交易额也越来越大。在每次交易会中，我国各对外贸易公司与各国贸易界朋友们就双方均感兴趣的贸易问题广泛地交换了意见，大大加深了彼此间的了解，增进了友谊，扩大了与各国贸易界人士的友好合作。因此，中国出口商品交易会对发展我国与各国间的正常贸易往来与友好合作亦起着一定的促进作用。
    随着我国工农业生产的不断发展，特别是今年以来工农业生产的大跃进以及全国范围内大搞文化革命与技术革命的结果，为我国出口商品提供了更加丰富的物质基础。在这次交易会中，陈列并可供出口的商品从今年春季交易会的一万四千多种增至二万种以上。虽然这里还不能全面地反映出我国工农业生产大跃进的整个面貌，特别是还不能全面地体现出我国科学技术水平迅速发展的面貌，但可以看出：我国的工农业正在以飞跃的速度发展着。许多过去我国不能生产或尚为某些国家对我国“禁运”的商品，现在我国不仅可以生产自给，还可以提供出口，其中有不少产品的质量已经达到或超过国际水平。
    在交易会中，我国各对外贸易公司除了与各地贸易界人士谈判出口贸易外，凡是符合我国经济建设需要的物资，也同时在交易会内酌情购进。我国在建国之始就主张在互相尊重国家的主权和平等互利的基础上，愿同世界上任何一个国家建立和发展贸易关系，不论它的社会制度如何，也不论它同我国有无外交关系，这种主张也是与我国的和平外交政策一致的。正是由于我国一贯坚定不移地执行了这个政策，以及随着我国工农业生产不断发展所提供的日益丰富的物质基础，使得我国的对外贸易有了迅速的发展。我国进出口贸易总额以1950年为一百，1952年（完成恢复经济时期）为一百五十六，1957年（完成第一个五年经济建设计划时期）增至二百五十二。目前，各方面的情况正预示着今年我国的对外贸易将有更大的增长。我国不仅与以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的贸易有了日益的巩固与发展，与亚非各友好国家的贸易也在不断的发展中，同西方不少国家的贸易也在逐年增长着。与我国有贸易往来关系的国家和地区，已从1956年的六十八个增至1958年的九十四个。今年以来，我国除了继续巩固、扩大与原来已有贸易往来的国家和地区的进、出口贸易以外，又与许多国家和地区建立了新的贸易关系。仅亚非两洲与我国有贸易往来的国家和地区就从1957年的三十二个增至今年的四十个，这对增强相互友好和促进彼此和平经济的发展都是有很大好处的。
    今年以来，以美国为首的资本主义国家的经济危机正在整个资本主义世界蔓延，受着经济危机风暴侵袭最甚的首先是在经济上依附美国的某些国家，这些国家的生产呈现萎缩，失业人口不断增加，这些国家中的工商界人士要求消除贸易歧视政策及要求与我国进行贸易的呼声也越来越高。因此，在平等互利基础上发展国际间的正常贸易往来，消除一切人为的贸易障碍，不仅是我国人民一贯的主张与愿望，而且也是全世界人民的共同的迫切要求。尽管日本岸信介政府违反爱好和平的日本人民的愿望，一手扼杀了战后已初步恢复起来的中日贸易，以及某些国家的政府当局对我国采取敌视的态度，仍然死死抱住早已破产的对我国的“禁运”“封锁”的反动政策；但是，这些不仅不能阻碍我国对外贸易及经济建设的不断发展，恰恰相反，我国与世界其他国家的政府和人民的贸易往来与友好合作，却日益巩固与发展了，我国的经济建设获得了巨大成就。可见帝国主义者和反动派是无法阻止世界和平力量的发展的。
    今年秋季中国出口商品交易会的举办是适时的，是符合我国及世界各国人民的共同愿望的。我们再一次表示欢迎各国贸易界人士前来参观并进行交易，并预祝此次交易会获得比以往更大的成功。
