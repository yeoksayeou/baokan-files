After the mass movement of "small, native, and communal" initiatives for the iron and steel industry was launched in various regions, the proportion of native iron in total pig iron production has been increasing. Native iron should be gradually adopted in steelmaking production. Most native pig iron is low in silicon and high in sulfur. In using this native iron for steelmaking (especially for converter steelmaking), various regions will encounter new desulfurization and temperature increase problems that have not been encountered domestically or internationally in the past. Obviously, in this situation, steelmaking production cannot demand the supply of pig iron according to past pig iron technical standards, nor can it carry out technical operations according to past routines.

In September of this year, a work group organized by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry conducted native iron steelmaking experiments at the Tianjin New Steel Plant. With the help of the plant's workers, initial success has been achieved.

The experiment was divided into three stages:

The first stage mainly focused on solving the desulfurization problem. The methods included: using an alkaline iron-melting furnace instead of an acidic iron-melting furnace and increasing the alkalinity of the slag, three rows of tuyeres, blowing lime into the molten iron ladle and adding lime, alkaline molten iron ladles, and blowing lime into the converter.

The second stage involved adding some equipment to mainly solve the temperature problem. The main items were: ① hot air for the iron-melting furnace; ② slag retention; ③ adopting top blowing and shallow blowing in the converter and reducing the amount of lime added, without adding ferrosilicon to increase the temperature; ④ adding phosphate rock to the iron-melting furnace; ⑤ carbon brick furnace lining for the iron-melting furnace; ⑥ rotary furnace; ⑦ small boiling steel ingots; ⑧ adding lime, fluorite powder, and carbon powder to the ladle; ⑨ desulfurization in the steel ladle.

The current experiment, focusing on the main workshop, mainly includes: small hot blast stoves, adding a forehearth to the iron-melting furnace, three rows of tuyeres for small converters, blowing lime into the furnace, continuous casting, low-temperature fast-speed casting, semi-killed steel, etc.

The experimental results prove that native iron can be made into steel. Using more than 80% native iron, mixed with some foreign iron, qualified steel containing 0.1% sulfur can be produced. At the same time, native iron steelmaking does not require ferrosilicon to increase the temperature, does not require soda to remove sulfur, and can produce boiling steel and semi-killed steel that require higher temperatures without using ferrosilicon for deoxidation. If the sulfur content of the steel is as high as 0.12%, it can be used for general purposes, and the sulfur content of the steel can be further reduced.

How can native iron be made into steel?

It is not without difficulties to make steel from native iron. The characteristics of native iron are: low silicon, high sulfur, low manganese, low carbon, and fluctuating composition. Therefore, the most important problems in converter native iron steelmaking are temperature increase and desulfurization. Low silicon, manganese, and carbon result in low calorific value, which can cause the molten iron to freeze, turning into iron oxide, or the steel ingot not being able to be poured.

Using conventional methods to refine high-sulfur pig iron will produce high-sulfur steel, which will crack when rolled and cannot be used.

To make steel from native iron, conditions must be created to solve the two major problems of desulfurization and temperature increase in native iron steelmaking. The main conditions for desulfurization are: alkaline slag; low and medium iron oxide, high temperature; good contact between slag and metal; and sufficient slag volume.

The main conditions for temperature increase and heat preservation are: first, increasing the heat source, mainly relying on the greater combustion of carbon in the molten iron to carbon dioxide, fully increasing the heat generated by carbon combustion and reducing heat loss.

The main measures for native iron converter steelmaking:

	(1) Hot Blast Alkaline Iron-Melting Furnace:

Since the iron-melting furnace requires high temperatures and better coke, the composition of native coke is fluctuating, some have high ash content, and some have low coke strength and are easily broken. Therefore, it is required to use native coal washing methods to greatly reduce the ash content in coking coal to increase the iron tapping temperature and easily create alkaline slag. If there is anthracite coal, it is best to mix it for use.

The furnace lining of the iron-melting furnace is made of dolomite.

At the New Steel Plant, the use of an alkaline iron-melting furnace can achieve a desulfurization effect of 50% to 70%, which can reduce the sulfur content of pig iron from 0.5% to 0.2% after melting. At the same time, the life of the dolomite furnace is not shortened. Although the melting rate is reduced by 20%, the melting rate will increase after using hot air.

As the slag alkalinity increases, the coke ratio needs to be increased.

After using hot air, the temperature of the molten iron increases. When the air temperature is 50 degrees, the molten iron temperature increases by about 20 degrees, and when the air temperature is 150 degrees, the molten iron temperature increases by about 50 degrees. Using an alkaline iron-melting furnace to increase slag alkalinity can increase desulfurization efficiency. Even if the slag alkalinity is increased to 2, the slag can still flow out without causing internal sticking and unsmooth furnace conditions.

Hot air not only increases the molten iron temperature of the alkaline iron-melting furnace, but also increases the desulfurization efficiency. It both increases temperature and removes sulfur, which is an extremely important measure for native iron steelmaking. After increasing the molten iron temperature, the utilization efficiency of oxygen in the air increases, the converter blowing time can also be shortened, and production can be increased. The New Steel Plant uses a tube-type hot blast stove for blast furnaces. A regenerative hot blast stove that does not use pig iron pipes is under construction.

	(2) Converter Aspect: First, simplify the amount of lime used. In the experiment at the New Steel Plant, a method of adding only half the original amount of lime (42 kilograms per ton of molten iron) was adopted to increase the steelmaking temperature. Since the phosphorus content in the molten iron is not high, it is not necessary to add too much lime. If the phosphorus content in the molten iron is higher than 0.15%, the amount of lime added can be appropriately increased to remove phosphorus. The heat generated by phosphorus is the greatest, which generally increases the temperature.

Low silicon content in the molten iron and insufficient tapping temperature are a problem that requires every effort to develop heat sources and save heat. Lime lowers the furnace temperature and needs to be carefully calculated, without adding any unnecessary lime.

Low silicon is a bad factor, but it also has good factors. When the silicon content is low, the blowing time can be shortened, and the furnace lining life can be improved. Blowing loss can also be reduced.

Second, adopt the slag retention method. The New Steel Plant once experimented with leaving two-thirds of the slag from the previous furnace in the furnace for desulfurization, which had a very good effect. The more slag retained, the greater the desulfurization efficiency. Therefore, the taphole should not be too large, otherwise the slag will not easily remain in the furnace.

Third, quick operation. Quick operation is a matter of heat preservation, a matter of not wasting a bit of heat. The various production processes should be well organized and closely coordinated. Here, it should be noted that the melting rate of molten iron should be slightly greater than that of the converter. The excess molten iron can be treated separately, so that the converter does not wait for the molten iron, which would lower the furnace lining temperature. Also, after tapping, the converter mouth should be covered with iron plates to prevent heat loss.

The molten iron should be tapped as late as possible to avoid prolonged waiting in the ladle and heat loss. Furnaces without a forehearth should have sufficient iron storage capacity for one furnace of steel. Releasing molten iron several times causes significant heat dissipation. The iron-melting furnace in Workshop 1 of the New Steel Plant raised the tuyeres and added a slag outlet to solve the problem of insufficient iron storage capacity.

Prolonged slag skimming time also causes significant heat dissipation. Slag skimming must be fast. The slag skimming time at the New Steel Plant is only one to two minutes.

Fourth, preheat the additives and keep the steel and iron ladles red hot.

In the experiment at the New Steel Plant, lime was heated on iron plates to maximize the temperature of the lime. Ferromanganese and ferrosilicon were also heated on iron plates and required to be burned red before being added to the furnace, so that the converter temperature would drop less. Steel and iron ladles are used in a red-hot state, and cold ladles are roasted red on coke ovens. It is required to cover the used steel and iron ladles with iron plates to reduce heat loss.

Other measures:

	(1) Desulfurization of molten iron ladles with lime, fluorite, and carbon powder. The experiment at the New Steel Plant proved that it is entirely possible to use lime, fluorite, and carbon powder to replace soda ash for desulfurization in molten iron ladles.

	(2) Blowing lime into the converter. In the experiment at the New Steel Plant, the first batch of lime added to the furnace was changed to lime powder, which was blown into the converter from the air duct. The desulfurization effect was greatly improved. The amount of sulfur removed from the skimmed slag was as high as 47%, with good results.

	(3) Steel ladle desulfurization. After the slag is skimmed off in the furnace for deoxidation, the desulfurizing agent is added to the furnace, and then the desulfurizing agent is flushed into the ladle together during tapping. This method has a better desulfurization efficiency. The highest efficiency in the experiment reached 16.6%, the sulfur content in the slag reached 1.6%, and no significant impact on the tapping temperature was observed.

	(4) Three rows of tuyeres. Three rows of tuyeres were tested on a 1.5-ton converter at the New Steel Plant, which can increase the temperature during operation.

	(5) Low-temperature casting. Extending the killing time, reducing the steel temperature to 1400 degrees Celsius, and performing casting resulted in a good steel surface and no cracking of the steel ingot. This experiment provides a method for pouring good steel ingots with steel at a lower temperature.

	(6) Continuous casting can avoid cooling the steel ladle.

	(7) Exhaust gas enters the forehearth.

	(8) Maintaining manganese in the steel at the upper limit, etc.

On September 30, the work group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry conducted a more comprehensive experiment in Workshop 1 of the New Steel Plant. The ingredients were 80% native iron and 20% high-silicon pig iron. As a result, native iron steelmaking was basically successful. Not a single catty of ferrosilicon was added to raise the temperature in the thirteen furnaces that were refined, and the pouring situation was good. The sulfur content in the steel was relatively high (generally 0.1% to 0.2%), but the physical properties of the steel were fully qualified. However, molten iron with a silicon content of 0.72% was also made into steel without adding ferrosilicon.

The measures taken in the September 30th experiment were: (1) Hot blast alkaline iron-melting furnace, with a furnace inlet air temperature of 150 degrees Celsius. (2) Slag retention operation. (3) Reducing the amount of lime used to 50 kilograms per ton of molten iron. (4) Baking lime and ferroalloys. (5) Heating and insulating steel and iron ladles at around 700 to 800 degrees Celsius, with close coordination between the iron-melting furnace and the converter. (6) Quick operation, with the time between furnaces shortened to one to two minutes, and the slag skimming time to one to two minutes. (7) Insulating the steel and iron ladles after tapping, covering the steel and iron water surfaces with straw bags. (8) Three rows of tuyeres. (9) Performing top blowing to make the carbon flame easier to ignite and increase the heat generated by carbon. (10) Adding asphalt blocks during splashing to break the foamy slag. Desulfurization in the ladle was not used in the experiment, and not a single catty of soda ash was used.

    怎样用土铁炼钢？
    ——冶金部工作组在天津新兴钢厂试用土铁炼钢的经验
    在各地开展了“小、土、群”的全民办钢铁工业的群众性运动后，生铁产量中土铁的比例愈来愈大，炼钢生产中要逐步采用土铁。土生铁多数是低矽高硫的。各地在用这种土铁炼钢（特别是用于转炉炼钢）中会遇到一个新的过去国内外都没有遇到过的除硫和提温的问题。显然，在这种情况下炼钢生产既不能按过去的生铁技术标准来要求供应生铁，也不能按过去常规来进行技术操作。
    今年9月，冶金工业部组织的工作组在天津新兴钢厂进行土铁炼钢试验，在该厂工人的帮助下，已经初步获得成功。
    试验分三个阶段进行：
    第一阶段主要是解决除硫问题。办法有：用碱性化铁炉代替酸性化铁炉并提高炉渣碱度，三排风眼，铁水包中吹石灰和加石灰，碱性铁水包，转炉吹石灰等。
    第二阶段进行了一些添加设备，以解决温度为主。主要项目有：①化铁炉用热风；②留渣；③转炉采用面吹和浅吹并减少石灰加入量，不加矽铁提温；④化铁炉加磷灰石；⑤炭砖化铁炉炉衬；⑥回转炉；⑦小型沸腾钢锭；⑧包中加石灰萤石粉及炭粉；⑨钢水包中脱硫。
    目前正在进行的以正车间为重点的试验，主要项目有：小热风炉，化铁炉加前膛，小转炉三排风眼，炉中吹石灰，无包浇注，低温快速度浇注，半镇静钢等。
    试验结果证明，土铁能炼成钢。用80％以上的土铁，掺用部分洋铁，可以炼成含0.1％硫的合格钢，同时土铁炼钢可以不用矽铁提温，不用苏打去硫，可以炼成温度要求较高的沸腾钢及半镇静钢，不用矽铁脱氧；如果硫高至0.12％的钢，可做一般用途使用，钢的含硫量还可进一步降低。
      土铁如何炼成钢？
    土铁炼钢不是没有困难的。土铁的特点是：矽低，硫高，锰低，炭低，成份波动。因此转炉土铁炼钢最主要的问题是提温与脱硫。矽、锰、炭低，发热量便低，会吹冻，吹成氧化铁或钢锭浇不起来。
    硫高的生铁用常规的方法去炼会炼出硫高的钢，轧制钢材会发裂，不能应用。
    要用土铁炼钢，必须为土铁炼钢中脱硫与提温两大问题创造条件。脱硫的主要条件是：碱性渣；中氧化铁低，温度高；渣子与金属有良好接触；充足的渣量。
    提温与保温的主要条件，一是增加热源，主要靠铁水中的炭更多燃烧二氧化炭，充分提高炭燃烧发热量减少热损失。
  土铁转炉炼钢的主要措施：
      （1）热风碱性化铁炉：
    由于化铁炉需要高的温度，需要较好的焦炭，土焦的成份是波动的，有的灰份很大，还有的焦强度低，易碎。因此要求用土法洗煤法把焦煤中灰份大大降低，以提高出铁温度与易造成碱性渣。如有白煤，最好掺着使用。
    化铁炉炉衬用白云石做。
    在新兴钢厂使用碱性化铁炉，脱硫效果可达50％到70％，可以使含硫零点五的生铁熔化后达到含硫零点二。同时白云石炉子寿命并不缩短。熔化率虽降低20％，但使用热风后熔化率会提高。
    由于渣碱度提高，焦比要有增加。
    使用热风后，使铁水温度提高。在风温为五十度时，铁水温度增加约二十度，在风温为一百五十度时，铁水温度增加约五十度。使用碱性化铁炉提高渣碱度，可以增大脱硫效率，渣子碱度即使提高至二，炉渣仍然能流出，不致发生炉内粘结和炉况不顺现象。
    热风既使碱性化铁炉铁水温度提高，也使去硫效率提高，既提温，又去硫，是土铁炼钢的极其重要的措施。提高铁水温度后，空气中氧的利用效率提高，转炉吹炼时间也可以缩短，增加产量。新兴钢厂用的是高炉用管式热风炉，不用生铁管的蓄热式热风炉在建造中。
      （2）转炉方面：第一是精简石灰用量。新兴钢厂试验中曾采取了只加原来一半石灰量的办法（每吨铁水四十二公斤），使炼钢温度高。由于铁水中磷不高，没有必要加过多的石灰。如果铁水中磷比零点一五高，可适当增多石灰加入量去磷。磷的发热量最大，总的来说是增加了温度。
    铁水中矽低，出钢温度不足，这是一个问题，需要千方百计来开发热源，节省热量。石灰使炉内温度降低，要精打细算，不多加一点不必要的石灰。
    矽低是个坏的因素，也有好的因素，矽低时，吹炼时间可以缩短，炉衬寿命可以提高。吹损还可以降低。
    第二是采用留渣法。新兴钢厂曾试验让上炉有三分之二的渣子留在炉中，用以去硫，效果很好。留渣量愈多，去硫效率愈大。因此出钢口不能过大，否则，渣子不易留在炉内。
    第三是快速操作。快速操作是保温问题，是不浪费一点热量的问题，应该把各个生产工序很好地组织起来，密切配合。这里，要注意使铁水的熔化率要稍大于转炉，有余的铁水可另作处理，不使转炉等待铁水降低了炉衬温度。还有，出钢后转炉口应加铁板，以防热量损失。
    铁水要尽量晚出炉，不使在包中久待散失热量，没有前膛的炉子应有足够一炉钢的贮铁量，铁水分数次放出，散热很大。新兴钢厂一车间化铁炉提高了风眼并增开了一个出渣口，解决了贮铁量不足的问题。
    扒渣时间过长，散热也大。一定要快扒渣。新兴钢厂扒渣时间只一到二分钟。
    第四是预热加入剂，保持钢、铁包红热。
    新兴钢厂试验中，石灰都在铁板上加热，尽量使石灰有高的温度。锰铁、矽铁也在铁板上加热，要求烧红加入炉内，使转炉温度降低得少一些。钢包、铁包在红热状态中使用，冷包在焦炭炉上烤红。要求用铁板盖上使用后的钢、铁包，以减少热量散失。
      其他的一些措施：
      （1）铁水包石灰、萤石、炭粉脱硫。新兴钢厂的试验证明，在铁水包加石灰、萤石、炭粉代替苏打脱硫是完全可以的。
      （2）转炉吹石灰。在新兴钢厂试验中把加入炉中的第一批石灰改为石灰粉，从风管吹入转炉中，去硫效果大大提高，扒出渣去硫量高达47％，效果良好。
      （3）钢包去硫。经试验在炉中扒去渣子进行脱氧，再把脱硫剂加入炉内，然后在出钢时连脱硫剂一同冲入包中。这个方法脱硫的效率较好，试验中最高效率达16.6％，渣中含硫量达一点六，出钢温度未见有大的影响。
      （4）三排风眼。在新兴钢厂一吨半的转炉上试用了三排风眼，可以提高操作中的温度。
      （5）低温浇注。延长镇静时间，把钢水温度降低到一千四百度，进行浇注，钢锭表面良好，钢锭没有发裂。这个试验提供了温度较低的钢水能浇出好钢锭的办法。
      （6）无包浇注，可免钢水包降温。
      （7）废气入前炉。
      （8）保持钢中锰在上限等等。
    冶金工业部工作组9月30日在新兴钢厂一车间进行了较全面的试验，配料为80％土铁，20％高矽生铁。结果土铁炼钢基本成功。所炼的十三炉中没有加一斤矽铁提温，浇注情况良好。钢材中含硫量较高（一般为零点一到零点二），但钢材的物理性能完全合格。但是零点七二含矽量的铁水，一样没有加矽铁，炼成了钢。
    9月30日的试验所采取的措施有：（1）热风碱性化铁炉，入炉风温为一百五十度。（2）留渣操作。（3）减少石灰用量至五十公斤一吨铁水。（4）石灰及铁合金进行烘烤。（5）钢水包及铁水包加热及保温在七百到八百度左右，化铁炉与转炉密切配合。（6）快速操作，炉与炉间时间短至一至二分，扒渣时间一至二分。（7）出炉后钢、铁水包进行保温，钢、铁水面上盖草袋。（8）三排风眼。（9）进行面吹使炭火焰易起使炭的发热量大。（10）喷溅时加沥青块，破坏泡沫渣。试验中不曾用包中脱硫，没有用一斤苏打。
