Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article appeared in the sixth issue of Shanghai's "Liberation" semi-monthly, and is now reprinted here for comrades to discuss. This issue needs discussion because it is an important issue at present. We believe that Zhang's article is basically correct, but there are some one-sidedness, that is, the explanation of the historical process is not complete. But he clearly raised this issue, drawing attention to it. The article is also easy to understand and good to read.

Anyone who knows a little about the history of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Revolution will know that within the Chinese People's Army and revolutionary base areas under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, from the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the later Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and People's Liberation Army, from the Jinggangshan base area to the later vast liberated areas, the fundamental principle of dealing with the internal relations of the people has always been equality between the army and the people, equality between officers and soldiers, and equality between superiors and subordinates. This principle was established in the earliest revolutionary base area, Jinggangshan, under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. In the report to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "The Struggle in Jinggangshan", Comrade Mao Zedong wrote:

	Most of the Red Army soldiers came from mercenary armies, but they changed their nature as soon as they joined the Red Army. First of all, the Red Army abolished the mercenary system, making the soldiers feel that they were not fighting for others, but for themselves and for the people. The Red Army has no regular salary system so far, only grain, oil, salt, firewood and vegetable money and a small amount of pocket money are issued. ...

	The Hunan Provincial Party Committee wants us to pay attention to the material life of the soldiers, at least to be better than the lives of ordinary workers and peasants. Now it is the opposite. In addition to grain, each person only has five cents of silver for oil, salt, firewood and vegetables every day, which is still difficult to maintain. ... It's so cold, many soldiers still wear two layers of single clothes. Fortunately, they are used to suffering. And everyone suffers the same, from the army commander to the cook, except for grain, all eat five cents worth of food. ...

	The Red Army's material life is so meager and the battles are so frequent, yet it can be maintained without collapsing. In addition to the role of the Party, it relies on the implementation of democracy within the army. Officers do not beat soldiers, officers and soldiers are treated equally, soldiers have the freedom to speak at meetings, cumbersome etiquette is abolished, and finances are made public. Soldiers manage the food, and they can still save a little from the five cents of oil, salt, firewood and vegetable money each day for pocket money, called "food scraps," about sixty or seventy cash per person per day. The soldiers are very satisfied with these methods. Especially the newly captured soldiers, they feel that the Kuomintang army and our army are two different worlds. Although they feel that the material life of the Red Army is not as good as that of the White Army, their spirits have been liberated. The same soldier, who was not brave in the enemy army yesterday, is very brave in the Red Army today. This is the influence of democracy. The Red Army is like a furnace, and the captured soldiers melt as soon as they come over. Not only do the people need democracy in China, but the army also needs democracy. The democratic system within the army will be an important weapon to destroy the feudal mercenary army.

As everyone knows, this Marxist-Leninist, communist relationship within the People's Army has become a model for internal relations within the revolutionary base areas. The same comrade-like equal relationship is observed in the relationship between the army and the people, between the government and the people, between the army and the government, between cadres, and between superiors, subordinates, and colleagues. People do not rely on having power and guns, not on official airs, not on prestige, but on serving the people, on persuasion, and on truth to handle mutual relations. The people in the revolutionary base areas also learned from the People's Liberation Army in handling the mutual relations between this part of the people and that part of the people. An outsider, stepping onto these liberated lands, will immediately discover that throughout the revolutionary base area, because the internal relations are correctly handled, although everyone's life is very difficult, "fortunately, they are used to suffering, and everyone suffers the same." Everyone lives a communist-style supply system life. Although there are slight differences in living standards due to the needs of work, they are not much different. At the same time, everywhere emphasizes politics and the mass line. Therefore, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants are united as one and are as close as family members, working hard and bravely killing the enemy. Do you still remember the scene of large-scale battles during the Liberation War? In order to support the People's Liberation Army, thousands upon thousands of militiamen followed the army south. They lived a military communist life just like the army. They did not seek promotion, nor did they seek wealth. They didn't even think about getting wages, let alone implementing any "piece-rate wage system". They carried their own food to make revolution. They were wholeheartedly dedicated to overthrowing the three major enemies and liberating all of China. The entire revolutionary base area, men and women, old and young, front and rear, were connected heart to heart and formed a fighting collective. It was this military communist life that marked the Marxist-Leninist ideology and work style, Mao Zedong's ideology and work style, which had taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in hundreds of millions of people. And this army and people, armed with communist ideology and tempered by combat, are invincible in the world! Hasn't the entire history of the Chinese revolution already proved this?

After the national liberation, this set of military communist life, characterized by the "supply system," was still very popular. Mentioning "supply system" was like talking about old revolutionaries, hard work, etc. People considered it an honor. Some revolutionary youths who had just started working also hoped to be on the "supply system," indicating that they, like the old comrades, were sincerely here to make revolution. Comrades who were used to the supply system life did not envy the salary system. People liked this living system that showed a kind of equal relationship. However, not long after, this living system was attacked by the bourgeois ideology of law. The core of the bourgeois ideology of law is the class system. In the eyes of people who adhere to this ideology, the supply system is really worthless. They contemptuously call it "rural style" and "guerrilla habits". This kind of discussion came from the bourgeoisie, which is not surprising. However, soon, many of our Party cadres accepted the influence of this ideology. Among them, discussions about the shortcomings of the supply system gradually increased, and discussions about the advantages of the salary system gradually prevailed. Later, the supply system almost became a bad name. Someone is not active in their work, "Whether you work or not, it's all the same!" This is recorded in the account of the supply system. Someone used a public envelope, "Public and private are not separated, supply system style!" Again recorded in the account of the supply system. Factories and shops were not well managed, and money was lost, "Supply system thinking!" Again recorded in the account of the supply system. In short, the communist supply system, the supply system that guaranteed the victory of the Chinese revolution, was attacked by some people as if it had committed a heinous crime and must be sentenced to death.

The most fundamental reason people attack the supply system is that the supply system cannot stimulate the enthusiasm for production. Their theoretical basis is the "principle of material interests" emphasized by economists. It is said that because under the socialist system, there are still many remnants of the old division of labor, that is, the differences between mental and physical labor, between worker labor and peasant labor, and between skilled labor and simple labor, the "principle of workers' concern for labor results and production development from material interests" is deified. What "grade wage system" and "piece-rate wage system" can stimulate workers to "show the greatest concern for their labor results", can stimulate "the development of socialist competition, because labor productivity is high and wages are also high", this system is "the most important lever for the development of the entire national economy", the reasoning is extremely numerous. However, to put it bluntly, to put it in simpler terms, it is still the old saying: "Money can make the gods move." As long as high wages are used to "stimulate", just like spending money to buy candy, socialism and communism can be bought immediately.

What can we say about such a theory?

Under the "supply system", thousands upon thousands of people carried out decades of armed struggle, climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed grasslands, and went on the 25,000-mile Long March. Who issued wages? Were the victories of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea also stimulated by wages? Hearing this kind of discussion, what else can every person with communist ideological awareness say except feel insulted? Just talking about construction, it was not others, but the workers who economists believed were most concerned about their wage levels, who expressed opinions completely opposite to those of economists. After a great airing of views and great debates, the workers of Shanghai sharply pointed out that this theory and method was "putting money in command" instead of putting politics in command. It's really getting to the point! Is there anything clearer than this? Of course, we do not deny that in the primary stage of communism, that is, in socialist society, as Marx correctly pointed out in "Critique of the Gotha Program", "it still bears the marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually." The inequality of "bourgeois right" cannot be eliminated immediately. It can only be "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and cannot yet be "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need." However, did Marx's passage tell us that the bourgeois right, the bourgeois unequal class system, cannot be destroyed at all, but should be institutionalized, systematized, and developed further? Should we only one-sidedly emphasize the "principle of material interests" and not strengthen communist education politically, ideologically, and morally, and fight for the complete abolition of bourgeois right? It was not others, but Marx himself, who answered this question. In his book "The Civil War in France," he summarized the experience of the Paris Commune, and he particularly emphasized and praised the measures taken by the heroes of the Paris Commune: "From the members of the Commune downwards, the public servants had to perform their service at workmen's wages. The vested interests and the representation allowances of high dignitaries of State disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves." Please see, the revolutionary measures taken by the Paris Commune - the world's first proletarian commune - were not precisely to thoroughly destroy the bourgeois class system and not pay attention to the principle of material interests? When Marx, and later Engels and Lenin, repeatedly emphasized this experience, did they not remember the bourgeois right, etc.? It seems that Marx, Engels, and Lenin did not help those economists who "see things but not people," "see money but not people," and "money can make the gods move." Lenin, in his book "State and Revolution," indignantly accused: "It is precisely on this most obvious point, perhaps the most important point of the state issue, that people have completely forgotten Marx's teachings!" And when many people mention this experience, they always regard it as an "outdated 'childish act'." Those who attack the supply system and advocate putting money in command, aren't they also saying that the supply system is "guerrilla style," "rural habit," and "outdated"? Haven't they also "completely forgotten Marx's teachings"?

Practice over the past few years has proved that the attacks on the "supply system," on the "rural style" and "guerrilla habits," are actually the bourgeoisie's attacks on the communist principles of correctly handling the mutual relations among the working people, in order to protect the unequal bourgeois rights and to attack the revolutionary traditions of the proletariat. All exploiting and oppressing classes protect the strict class system. They do not hesitate to fabricate various myths, saying that they are "sons of heaven" and born masters of the world. Chiang Kai-shek, this ugly human being, shamelessly claimed in his book "China's Destiny" that his bloodline was a descendant of King Wen, and his biography even more specifically stated that he was a descendant of King Wen's son, the Duke of Zhou. Although this kind of myth should only be included in "Laughing Forest Records," it can be seen how eager they are to disguise themselves as a born Chinese "supreme." The compradores in Shanghai also took pride in being "higher-class Chinese." Ah Q was slapped hard by Zhao Taiye just because he said that he "and Zhao Taiye are from the same family": "How can you be surnamed Zhao! You are not worthy of being surnamed Zhao!" In the old era, in the entire society, from whether or not you are worthy of being surnamed Zhao, to clothing, eating, housing, walking, the speed of walking, and the posture of smoking, which one did not pay attention to status and class? Which one did not have "rites"? Complying with the rites and not complying with the rites, that is, legal and illegal, everywhere there are bourgeois rights. Those who attack the supply system for not stimulating the enthusiasm for production actually want to replace the proletarian equal relationship with the bourgeois class system of rites and laws. They say that this can stimulate the enthusiasm for production. Is it really like this? As a result of promoting their system, the original situation in which the living standards of our Party cadres were not much different has changed. Some people who had long been unable to endure a life of hard work and simplicity quickly learned the airs of gentlemen, higher-class Chinese, and Zhao Taiye. Some cadres are uncomfortable if they don't call each other something like "chief" when they meet. This really played a stimulating role. However, it did not stimulate the enthusiasm for production, but stimulated the enthusiasm for fame in the court and profit in the market, stimulated the enthusiasm for extravagance and waste without shame but with honor, and stimulated the enthusiasm for being divorced from the masses without shame but with honor. Some of the most unswerving elements degenerated into bourgeois rightists and corrupt elements. Originally, someone said that the supply system would make people lazy. Now it has been proven that, on the contrary, it is the class system that makes people lazy. Some cadres even calculate overtime pay for working an extra hour. And under the supply system, in the revolutionary war, people who contributed everything, even their lives, did they calculate any kind of fees? More seriously, with the development of this trend, the mutual relationship between cadres and the working people has changed, and the "three styles" and "five airs" of leading cadres have developed. Putting politics in command, treating people equally, only persuading and not coercing the masses, and being one with the masses - all these things have been completely forgotten by some people, and even after the Party Central Committee issued instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, they still encountered their resistance. Isn't this a fact that we have personally experienced?

Looking back at this period is of profound educational significance to each of us. In this process, although everyone's situation of agreeing with or opposing something is different, and the influence received is also different, we can all find necessary lessons from this.

Because the Party's tradition is Marxist-Leninist and has taken root in our Party's cadres and the people, although it has suffered some damage, it is not too difficult to restore it. Now, under the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, it has been restored through the great rectification movement. However, we cannot say that it has been done thoroughly. The bourgeois ideology of law and the official airs of the Kuomintang still affect people. The policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people is still being resisted by some people. There is still a long and repeated struggle process ahead of us. However, since the situation of the Great Leap Forward urgently requires us to leap forward and leap forward again in adjusting mutual relations, all comrades who are loyal to the communist cause will surely be able to stand at the forefront of the movement and completely restore and carry forward this glorious tradition of our Party under new conditions, thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois ideology of law, establish equal mutual relations with the masses, completely unite superiors, subordinates, and colleagues, live, labor, and work together, and strive together for socialism and communism. Can there be any doubt about this?

    破除资产阶级的法权思想
    张春桥
    编者按：张春桥同志此文，见之于上海“解放”半月刊第六期，现在转载于此，以供同志们讨论。这个问题需要讨论，因为它是当前一个重要的问题。我们认为，张文基本上是正确的，但有一些片面性，就是说，对历史过程解释得不完全。但他鲜明地提出了这个问题，引人注意。文章又通俗易懂，很好读。
    凡是略为知道中国共产党和中国革命历史的人，都会知道：在中国共产党领导下的中国人民军队和革命根据地内部，从工农红军到后来的八路军、新四军、人民解放军，从井冈山根据地到后来广大的解放区，在那里，从来就是以军民平等、官兵平等、上下平等作为处理人民内部相互关系的根本原则的。这个原则，是在最早的革命根据地井冈山，在毛泽东同志的直接领导下创立起来的。在“井冈山的斗争”这篇向中共中央的报告中，毛泽东同志写道：
    红军士兵大部分是由雇佣军队来的，但一到红军即变了性质。首先是红军废除了雇佣制，使士兵感觉不是为他人打仗，而是为自己为人民打仗。红军至今没有什么正规的薪饷制，只发粮食、油盐柴菜钱和少数的零用钱。……
    湖南省委要我们注意士兵的物质生活，至少要比普遍工农的生活好些。现在则相反，除粮食外，每天每人只有五分大洋的油盐柴菜钱，还是难乎为继。……这样冷了，许多士兵还是穿两层单衣。好在苦惯了。而且什么人都是一样苦，从军长到伙夫，除粮食外一律吃五分钱的伙食。……
    红军的物质生活如此菲薄，战斗如此频繁，仍能维持不敝，除党的作用外，就是靠实行军队内的民主主义。官长不打士兵，官兵待遇平等，士兵有开会说话的自由，废除烦琐的礼节，经济公开。士兵管理伙食，仍能从每日五分的油盐柴菜钱中节余一点作零用，名曰“伙食尾子”，每人每日约得六七十文。这些办法，士兵很满意。尤其是新来的俘虏兵，他们感觉国民党军队和我们军队是两个世界。他们虽然感觉红军的物质生活不如白军，但是精神得到了解放。同样一个兵，昨天在敌军不勇敢，今天在红军很勇敢，就是民主主义的影响。红军像一个火炉，俘虏兵过来马上就熔化了。中国不但人民需要民主主义，军队也需要民主主义。军队内的民主主义制度，将是破坏封建雇佣军队的一个重要的武器。
    正像大家所知道的，人民军队内部的这种马克思列宁主义的、共产主义的相互关系，成了革命根据地内部相互关系的模范。在军民关系上、在政民关系上、在军政关系上、干部相互关系上、上下左右的相互关系上，也同样遵守这种同志式的平等关系。人们不是靠手里有权、有枪，不是靠官架子，不是靠威风，而是靠为人民服务，靠说服，靠真理，处理相互关系。革命根据地的人民群众，也学着人民解放军的样子，处理这一部分人民和那一部分人民之间的相互关系。外来的人，一踏上这些解放了的土地，就立刻会发现：在整个革命根据地内部，由于正确地处理了内部关系，大家的生活虽然很艰苦，但是，“好在苦惯了，而且什么人都一样苦”，大家过着共产主义性质的供给制生活，虽然因为工作的需要，生活水平略有差别，但相差不多。同时到处讲政治、讲群众路线，因此，工农兵学商，团结一致，亲如家人，艰苦奋斗，英勇杀敌。大家还记得解放战争时期大兵团作战的情景吗？为了支援人民解放军，成千、成万的民兵跟随大军南下，他们同军队一样地过着军事共产主义生活，一不为升官，二不为发财，甚至也没有想到要发工资，更没有想到要实行什么“计件工资制”，他们是自己背着自己的粮食来干革命的，他们一心一意，只为打倒三大敌人，解放全中国。整个革命根据地，男女老幼，前方后方，心连着心，结成了战斗的集体。正是这种军事共产主义生活，标志着马克思列宁主义的思想作风，毛泽东的思想作风，在亿万人民中已经扎了根，开了花，结了果。而这种用共产主义思想武装起来的、经过战斗锻炼的军队和人民，是无敌于天下的！中国革命的全部历史不是早已作了证明吗？
    在全国解放以后，这种以“供给制”为特点的一套军事共产主义生活，还是很吃香的。提到“供给制”，如同说到老革命、说到艰苦奋斗等等一样，人们认为是光荣的。一些革命青年刚刚参加工作，也希望是“供给制”，表示自己像老同志一样，是真心实意地来革命的。原来过惯了供给制生活的同志，也并不羡慕什么薪金制，人们喜爱这种表现一种平等的相互关系的生活制度。但是，没有多久，这种生活制度受到了资产阶级法权思想的攻击。资产阶级法权思想的核心是等级制度。在坚持这种思想的人们看来，供给制的一套，实在毫无可取。他们轻蔑地说它是“农村作风”，“游击习气”。这种议论来自资产阶级，本不足怪。可是，不久，在我们党的干部中，有不少人接受了这种思想的影响。在他们中间，谈论供给制的缺点的议论渐渐地多起来了，谈论薪金制的优点的议论逐渐占上风了。到后来，供给制几乎成了一个坏名称。有人工作不积极，“干不干，二斤半！”这要记在供给制的账上。有人用了公家一个信封，“公私不分，供给制作风！”又记在供给制的账上。工厂、商店没有经营好，赔了钱，“供给制思想！”又是记在供给制账上。总之，共产主义的供给制，保证了中国革命胜利的供给制，被某些人攻击得好像犯了大罪，非判处死刑不可。
    人们攻击供给制的最根本的理由，就是供给制不能刺激生产积极性。他们的理论根据就是经济学家们所强调的“物质利益的原则”。据说，由于在社会主义制度下，还保存着不少旧的分工的残余，即脑力劳动同体力劳动之间、工人劳动同农民劳动之间、熟练劳动同简单劳动之间的差别，因此，“工作者从物质利益上关心劳动结果和生产发展的原则”就被说得神乎其神。什么“等级工资制”、“计件工资制”可以刺激工人“对自己的劳动成果表现最大的关心”呀，可以刺激“社会主义竞赛的发展，因为劳动生产率高，工资也高”呀，这种制度是“整个国民经济发展的最重要的杠杆”呀，道理多极了。不过，说穿了，说得通俗一些，还是那句老话：“钱能通神”。只要用高工资“刺激”，就像花钱买糖果一样，什么社会主义、共产主义都能够立刻买到手的。
    对于这样的理论，我们能够说些什么呢？
    在“供给制”的情况下，千千万万的人进行了几十年的武装斗争，爬雪山，过草地，两万五千里长征，有谁发过工资？抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争的胜利，难道也是靠工资刺激出来的吗？听到这种议论，每一个有共产主义思想觉悟的人除了感到是一种侮辱，还能说什么呢？就说在建设事业上吧，不是别人，正是那些被经济学家认为最关心自己工资高低的工人们，说出了同经济学家根本相反的意见。上海的工人们，经过大鸣大放大辩论，尖锐地指出了这种理论和办法是“钞票挂帅”，而不是政治挂帅。真是一语破的！还有比这说得更清楚的吗？当然，我们并不否认在共产主义的初级阶段即社会主义社会，如同马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中所正确指出的，“它在各方面，在经济、道德和思想方面，都还带有它脱胎出来的那个旧社会的痕迹。”“资产阶级的法权”的不平等，还不能立即取消。只能“各尽所能，按劳取酬”，还不能“各尽所能，各取所需”。但是，马克思的这段话，有没有告诉我们，资产阶级的法权，资产阶级的不平等的等级制度，根本不能破坏，反而应当把它制度化、系统化、更加向前发展呢？是不是只应当片面地强调“物质利益”原则，而不应当从政治上、思想上、道德上加强共产主义的教育，为彻底破除资产阶级的法权进行斗争呢？不是别人，而是马克思本人，答复了这种问题。他在“法兰西内战”一书中，总结了巴黎公社的经验，他特别着重地赞扬了巴黎公社的英雄们采取的这种措施：“从公社委员起，自上而下一切公职人员，都只应领取相当于工人工资的薪金。国家高级官吏所享有的一切特权及支付他们的办公费，都随着这些官吏的消失而消失。”请看，巴黎公社——全世界第一个无产阶级的公社所采取的革命措施，难道不恰恰是彻底破坏资产阶级的等级制度、并不讲究什么物质利益原则吗？难道马克思以及后来恩格斯、列宁都再三强调这条经验的时候，他们不记得还有资产阶级的法权等等吗？看来，马克思、恩格斯、列宁并没有给这些“见物不见人”、“见钱不见人”、“钱能通神”的经济学家帮忙。列宁在“国家与革命”一书中，倒是愤慨地指责：“正是在这特别明显的一点上，也许是国家问题的最重要的一点上，人们把马克思的教训忘得干干净净！”而许多人在提到这条经验的时候，总把它看作是“已经过时的‘幼稚行为’”。那些攻击供给制、主张钞票挂帅的人们，不是也说什么供给制是“游击作风”、“农村习气”、是“已经过时”的东西了吗？他们不是也“把马克思的教训忘得干干净净”了吗？
    经过几年来的实践，证明了对“供给制”、对“农村作风”、“游击习气”的攻击，实际上是资产阶级为了保护不平等的资产阶级的法权，为了打击无产阶级的革命传统，而对正确处理劳动人民内部相互关系的共产主义原则的攻击。一切剥削阶级、压迫阶级都是保护严格的等级制度的。他们不惜捏造各种神话，说自己是“天子”，是天生的人间的主人。蒋介石这种人间的丑类，在“中国之命运”一书中，就不知羞耻地自称他的血统是文王的子孙，他的一本传记更具体地说他是文王的儿子——周公的子孙。这种神话虽然只应编入“笑林广记”，却可以看出：他们是多么急于把自己化装成一个天生的中国“最高”。上海的买办们，也是以“高等华人”。为荣的。阿Q只因说了一句他“和赵太爷是本家”，挨了赵太爷狠狠地一个嘴巴：“你怎么会姓赵！你那里配姓赵！”在旧时代，整个社会上，从配不配姓赵，到穿衣、吃饭、住房子、走路、走路的快慢、抽烟的姿势，哪一条不要讲究身份、等级？哪一项没有“礼”？合乎礼、不合乎礼，也就是合法、不合法，处处都有资产阶级的法权。攻击供给制不能刺激生产积极性的人们，实际上就是要用资产阶级等级制度的礼、法来代替无产阶级的平等关系。他们说这样可以刺激生产积极性。是不是真是这样呢？推行他们这一套的结果，我们党的干部中，原来生活水平相差不多的状况改变了，有些早已对艰苦朴素的生活忍耐不住的人，迅速地学会了绅士派头、高等华人派头、赵太爹派头来了。有的干部见面不称什么什么“长”，就不舒服起来了。这确实起了刺激作用。但是，并不是刺激起了生产的积极性，而是刺激起了争名于朝、争利于市的积极性，刺激起了铺张浪费不以为耻反以为荣的积极性，刺激起了脱离群众不以为耻反以为荣的积极性，有些最不坚定的分子就堕落为资产阶级右派分子、贪污腐化分子。原来有人说供给制会使人们懒惰起来。现在证明，恰恰相反，倒是等级制度把人弄懒惰起来了。有的干部多作一个小时的工作，也要计算加班费了。而在供给制的条件下，在革命战争中把自己的一切，以至生命都贡献出来的人们，他们计算过什么什么费吗？更为严重的是，这种风气发展起来，干部同劳动人民的相互关系变化了，领导干部的“三风”、“五气”有了发展。政治挂帅，平等待人，对待群众只能说服、不能压服，同群众打成一片，所有这些，在有些人，已经完全忘记了，甚至当党中央发出正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示以后，还遇到他们的节节抵抗。这难道不是我们所亲身经历的事实吗？
    回想一下这一段，对我们每一个人都是有深刻的教育意义的。在这个过程中，我们每个人赞成什么、反对什么的情况虽然不同，受到的影响深浅也不同，但是，都可以从这中间找到必要的教训。
    因为党的传统是马克思列宁主义的，是在我们党的干部和人民群众中扎下根的，它虽然遭受到某种破坏，恢复起来并不太困难。现在，在党中央和毛泽东同志的号召下，经过伟大的整风运动，又把它恢复过来了。但是，我们还不能说已经做得很彻底。资产阶级的法权思想、国民党的官气，还影响着人们。正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针，还受到某些人的抵抗。我们的前面还有一个长期的反复的斗争过程。但是，既然大跃进的形势迫切地要求我们在调整相互关系方面跃进、再跃进，一切忠实于共产主义事业的同志们，一定能够站在运动的前头，把我们党的这种光荣传统，在新的条件下，彻底恢复和发扬起来，彻底破除资产阶级的法权思想，同群众建立起平等的相互关系，上下左右完全打成一片，大家共同生活，共同劳动，共同工作，一致为社会主义和共产主义奋斗，这难道能有什么怀疑吗？
