The Huangyuan County Committee in Qinghai Province has adopted several new measures to specifically address the problem of labor shortages.

These measures are: First, the smelting of iron and steel is no longer carried out by individual communes in a scattered manner, but is undertaken by four communes which take on the county's entire task, drawing people to concentrate in the county seat for smelting. This saves one-third of the manpower compared to scattered efforts. The construction of railways and water conservancy projects are also undertaken by several communes depending on the circumstances. In agriculture, the transportation of wheat bundles back to the village and the digging of potatoes must be completed within a short period of time, and deep plowing and manure delivery must also be completed before the ground freezes. It is currently impossible to cultivate all 320,000 mu of land in the county intensively and meticulously. In accordance with the spirit of "planting less and harvesting more," it has been decided to first ensure the deep plowing of the 40,000 mu of old paddy fields, 100,000 mu of high-altitude rainy land, and 30,000 mu of dry land that produce high yields.

Second, livestock power is allocated on a large scale, and is used flexibly according to needs and livestock size.

Third, it is advocated to replace men with women and full laborers with semi-laborers in all tasks.

Fourth, improve tools and operating techniques.

With the implementation of these methods, the problem of labor shortages in Huangyuan County has been basically resolved.

    人力不分散工作有重点
    本报讯　青海湟源县委采取了一些新的措施，具体地解决劳力紧张的问题。
    这些措施是：一、冶炼钢铁，不再由各个公社分散搞，而由四个公社把全县任务担起来，抽人集中到县城炼。这样，比分散搞省三分之一的人。修铁路、水利等也根据情况由几个公社负担。在农业上，运麦捆子回村和挖洋芋必须短期内赶完，深耕、送粪也要在地冻前突击完成。全县三十二万亩地目前不可能全部精耕细作，根据“少种多收”的精神，决定首先保证高产的四万亩老水地、十万亩高山多雨地和三万亩平旱地的深耕。
    二、畜力实行大范围调配，根据需要和畜力大小机动使用。
    三、在各项工作上提倡以女代男，以半劳力代全劳力。
    四、改进工具和操作技术。
    推行了这样一些办法，湟源县劳力紧张问题已得到基本解决。
