At 12:10 PM on October 26th, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers led the last unit to withdraw from Korea.

The train slowly headed north. Cheers, songs, and applause resounded along both banks of the Yalu River. Flags and flowers on both sides formed a colorful ocean. As we stepped onto this bridge of friendship and battle over the Yalu River, passing over this green, surging river, and headed toward the triumphal arch of our motherland, these sounds of peace, the scenes of joy, and the years of battle that we recalled, like the roaring waters of the Yalu River, stirred our heartstrings. We looked south, and the undulating golden rice ears growing out of the scarred land of bomb craters filled us with gratification; we looked north, and the thick black smoke billowing from the towering chimneys filled us with excitement.

We are back, great motherland! On the frozen banks of Changjin Lake, on the peaks leveled at Shangganling, in the first bright bugle call of Wenjing City, in the icy rapids of the Imjin River, you have always been the inexhaustible source of our strength. Huang Jiguang's last words when bidding farewell to his comrades were: "Please let the motherland hear our good news." Yang Gensi gloriously sacrificed himself while shouting "Long live the motherland!" On the very first day we crossed the Yalu River, we excitedly discussed "when we return victoriously to our country..." In the tunnels of the "Underground Great Wall," we often smiled when talking about our lovely hometown and the victorious tomorrow. Now, we are again moved to tears as we say to you: "Motherland, Mother! Your sons and daughters who fought for you have returned victoriously."

Goodbye, Korean comrades who have broken through the storm of war with us! We will not forget the snowy mountain roads, ridges, and gullies along our march into Korea, nor will we forget the green grass and fragrant flowers on our triumphant return. We will not forget the warm embraces, face to face with tears exchanged, between the two brotherly armies of China and Korea on the Wolf Forest Mountain, nor will we forget the brotherly joint combat of the heroic armies of the two countries on Brothers Peak. The heroic image of An Yu-ji, who sacrificed her youth to save our reconnaissance personnel, and the immortal friendship of Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his life to prevent our wounded from suffering a second injury, will forever live in our hearts. And the joyful songs of the children ringing along the road, and the fragrant red flowers presented to us with trembling hands by the white-haired old men, have all soothed our hearts as we bid farewell.

This is an unforgettable moment. Our train is about to enter the triumphal arch of our motherland. At this moment, the battle-hardened generals on our train could not help but become excited. Major General Zhang Mingyuan sang the "Volunteer Army Battle Song," and General Wang Ping repeatedly said, "We're back to the motherland!" General Yang Yong said, "Now my heart can be said to be filled with the greatest joy and excitement in the world. Back then, when we crossed the Yalu River, we relied almost solely on machine guns, mortars, rifles, and grenades to meet the enemy armed to the teeth. However, we also held the weapon of justice, and we finally thoroughly exposed the outwardly strong but inwardly weak nature of the American imperialist paper tiger and achieved victory." At the same time, all the officers and soldiers on the train were excitedly discussing the hardships of the past, the victory of today, and the determination for tomorrow. The officers and soldiers of a heroic Volunteer Army unit that was once waiting for orders in Andong remembered October 25th eight years ago. On that day, they received an urgent notice from the Volunteer Army leadership: the enemy had reached a place only forty li away from Sinuiju, and could reach the opposite bank of Andong in just one hour. It was also during that period that the bosses on Wall Street openly clamored to "strangle our newborn motherland in its cradle"; several thick and conspicuous red offensive arrows pointing to Shenyang were no longer concealed on the Pentagon's military maps; MacArthur also declared that "the Yalu River is not an insurmountable barrier that clearly divides (China and Korea)." At that time, Korea was in crisis, the motherland was in crisis, and world peace was also in crisis. Pillars of fire rose from Sinuiju, and the ashes that blotted out the sky fluttered down on the streets of Andong. Countless Korean mothers, their legs injured by bombs, struggled in the sea of ​​fire with babies in their arms. "Cross the river!" "Hold Sinuiju, ensure the safety of Andong!" "We must never let the people of our motherland suffer the same disaster!" The Volunteer Army soldiers were enraged. They held a swearing-in meeting to cross the river facing the Yalu River water reddened by the flames of war. One heroic unit after another crossed the river at a pace of five minutes per person. When the river bridge was bombed, the brave men climbed over the river by grabbing the iron frame beside the bridge and bravely rushed to the road to kill the enemy.

When they had just crossed the Yalu River, whether in the eastern or western front, everyone's mood was heavy and慷慨激昂. In the first battle abroad in Wenjing City, where 15,000 enemies were annihilated, whenever the troops ran out of ammunition and food, the soldiers encouraged each other and said: "Behind us is the Yalu River. No matter how crazy the enemy is, no matter what weapons they use, we must resolutely drive them back, and we must never allow the enemy to step into our national gate!" On the snowy eastern front, one unit did not have time to change into northern winter clothes before going abroad due to the short period of the trip to Korea. The severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius froze some of them so that their feet were so swollen that they could not wear shoes, and their flesh turned black. Some had frozen hands and could not lift their guns. However, they still marched day and night through the raging wind and snow. In order to seize the commanding height of Changjin Lake - Huangcaoling, the heroes broke through the ice and snow for 180 li overnight and successfully seized the highest peak of Huangcaoling, like a "sharp blade" inserted into the heart of the US military, tightening the "mouth of the bag" surrounding the enemy. Subsequently, they remained firmly blocked like an unbreakable "sluice gate," blocking the two sides of the enemy retreating from the north and reinforcing from the south, ensuring the victory of the entire line.

In the early days of going abroad, many soldiers who had just left machines, put down hoes, and walked out of classrooms had no combat experience, and the enemy's weapons and equipment were far superior to ours. However, we have always firmly believed that the final victory must belong to us. The soldiers said: "The enemy relies on equipment, we rely on justice," "The enemy fights mechanization; we fight ingenuity," "The enemy has steel; we have a strong will." When a unit first fought the enemy near Fomidi near Seoul in early January 1951, many soldiers had never seen a tank, but they annihilated the British "Royal Heavy Tank Battalion" in just two hours with only two companies. There is also such a heroic unit: they still had some tactical shortcomings in their first battle with the US military, but one or two years later, on a position of less than 2.7 square kilometers, they repelled more than 900 attacks by more than 60,000 enemies from four divisions. Fighting for 43 days and nights, they killed and wounded more than 25,000 enemies, and the position remained standing still - this is the world-famous Battle of Shangganling. A colonel from the heroic unit that defended Shangganling that year said excitedly when he returned to Andong after nearly eight years of separation: "Justice is in our hands, and we finally won."

The train stopped at Andong Station. The triumph song along the Yalu River pierced the clouds.

    鸭绿江凯歌
    新华社记者　徐熊
    10月26日中午十二时十分，志愿军总部率领最后一支部队撤离了朝鲜。
    列车徐徐向北驶进、欢呼声、歌声和掌声响遍鸭绿江两岸。两岸的旗帜和鲜花汇成了彩色的海洋。当我们跨上这友谊的战斗的鸭绿江大桥，穿过这碧绿的滔滔奔流的江面，而向祖国凯旋门驶进的时候，这些和平的声音，欢乐的景象和我们随之忆起的那些战斗的岁月，就像鸭绿江里汹涌澎湃的江水一样，激动着我们的心弦。我们向南看，那些在纍纍弹坑中长起的波浪起伏的金色稻穗使我们感到快慰；向北看，那些林立的烟囱中冒出浓黑的烟柱又使我们感到兴奋。
    我们回来了，伟大的祖国！在天寒地冻的长津湖畔，在高峰削平的上甘岭上，在温井城第一声嘹亮的进军号角声中，在临津江严寒的激流里，你始终是我们无穷无尽的力量的泉源。黄继光在告别战友时最后一句话是：“请祖国听我们的好消息。”杨根思在高呼“祖国万岁”声中壮烈牺牲。在当年跨过鸭绿江的第一天，我们便爱兴奋地谈论“当我们凯旋回国的时候……”，在坚守“地下长城”的坑道里，我们常常因谈起可爱的家乡和胜利的明天而开颜大笑。现在，我们又激动得热泪盈眶地向你说：“祖国，母亲！为你而战的儿女们胜利归来了。”
    再见，曾经和我们一起冲破战争风暴的朝鲜战友们！我们忘不了入朝初期那白雪掩盖了的进军途中的山路、山岗和山沟，也忘不了今天凯旋道上的绿草香花。我们忘不了狼林山上第一次朝中两支兄弟部队脸贴着脸和热泪交流的热烈拥抱，也忘不了兄弟峰上两国的英雄部队亲如手足的共同战斗。为拯救我们侦察员而献出了青春的安玉姬的英雄形象，为不让我们伤员负第二次伤而牺牲了自己生命的朴在根的不朽友情，都将永远活在我们的心上。而那些路旁响起的孩子们喜气洋洋的歌声，那些白发老人用颤动的手给我们捧上的芬香扑鼻的红花，又都抚慰了我们惜别的心。
    这是永远使人难忘的时刻，我们的列车即将驶进祖国的凯旋门了。这时候，我们列车上那些身经百战的将军们，也都情不自禁地激动起来。张明远少将唱起了“志愿军战歌”，王平上将连声说：“到祖国了！”杨勇上将说：“现在的心可说是充满了人间最大的快乐和最大的兴奋。当年，我们跨过鸭绿江的时候，几乎只是凭机关枪、迫击炮、步枪和手榴弹去迎击武装到牙齿的敌人。然而我们还握有正义的武器，我们终于彻底戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎外强中干的面目，取得了胜利。”与此同时，列车上所有的官兵也都在兴奋地谈论着往日的艰苦，今天的胜利和明天的决心。当年曾在安东待命的一支志愿军英雄部队的官兵们，想起了八年前的10月25日。就在这一天，他们得到了志愿军领导机关的紧急通知：敌人已到达离新义州只有四十华里的地方，只要一个钟头就可能兵临安东对岸。也就在那个时期，华尔街的老板们公开叫嚣要把我们新生的祖国“扼死在摇篮里”；几条指向沈阳的粗大而醒目的红色进攻箭头，已不再掩饰地划在五角大楼的军用地图上；麦克阿瑟也扬言“鸭绿江并不是（中朝）两国截然划分的不可逾越的障碍。”当时，朝鲜在危急中，祖国在危急中，世界和平也在危急中。新义州腾起了冲天的火柱，遮天的灰烬纷纷飘落在安东大街上。无数被炸伤了腿的朝鲜大娘，怀抱婴儿的朝鲜母亲在火海中挣扎。“跨过江去！”“坚守新义州、确保安东！”“绝不能让祖国人民遭受这同样灾难！”志愿军战士们激怒了。他们迎着战火映红了的鸭绿江水举行了渡江誓师大会。一支又一支的英雄部队以每人五分钟的速度快步过了江。当江桥被炸后，勇士们就手攀桥旁铁架爬过江去，英勇奔上杀敌的道路。
    刚刚跨过鸭绿江的时候，不管在东线或者西线的部队，每个人的心情都是沉重而又慷慨激昂。在温井城歼敌一万五千人的出国首次战役中，每当部队弹尽粮绝的时候，战士们就互相激励地说：“我们背后就是鸭绿江，不管敌人如何疯狂，不管敌人用什么武器，我们都必须坚决把他们打回去，绝不许敌人跨进我们的国门！”在风雪东线，一支部队由于入朝时行期短促，来不及换上北方的冬装就出征了。零下四十度的严寒冻得他们有的人脚肿得穿不下鞋子，肉成了乌黑色，有的人冻僵了的手，举不起枪。可是，他们仍然冒着狂风暴雪日夜兼程迈进。为了抢占长津湖畔的制高点——黄草岭，英雄们一夜踏破冰雪一百八十里，胜利地抢占了黄草岭最高峰，像一把“利刃”插进了美军的心脏，扎紧了包围敌人的“口袋嘴”。随后，他们又始终像一座不可冲破的“闸门”一样，牢牢堵住了从北边溃退下来的和从南边增援上来的两方面敌人，保证了全线的胜利。
    在出国初期的日子里，许多刚刚离开机器、放下锄头、走出课堂的战士们是没有战斗经验的，而敌人的武器装备大大优越于我们。但是，我们一直就坚信最后胜利一定属于我们。战士们说：“敌人靠装备，我们靠正义”，“敌人打的机械化；我们打的巧妙化”，“敌人有钢铁；我们有坚强的意志”。有一支部队当1951年1月初在汉城附近的佛弥地第一次同敌人交手时，还有许多战士从未见过坦克，然而他们只以两个连的兵力就在两小时内全歼了英国“皇家重坦克营”。也有这样一支英雄部队：他们在初次和美军作战时战术上还有些缺点，可是一、二年后，他们在不到二点七平方公里的阵地上，却打退了敌人四个师六万人以上的九百多次冲击。奋战四十三昼夜，杀伤敌人二万五千多人，而阵地始终屹立未动——这就是名扬世界的上甘岭战役。一位来自当年坚守上甘岭英雄部队的上校在回到分别将近八年的安东时，兴奋地说：“正义在我们手里，我们终于胜利了。”
    列车在安东车站停下了。鸭绿江畔凯歌贯云霄。
