This Is Also Called an "Accidental Incident"!
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The crime of the United States instructing the Chiang Kai-shek air force to use "Sidewinder" missiles to attack the mainland air force has already been confessed to by various American news agencies. Dulles was also forced to admit at a press conference on the 30th that the United States had indeed supplied the Chiang Kai-shek clique with "Sidewinder" missiles. However, he attempted to shirk responsibility, saying that the incident of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft using "Sidewinder" missiles "occurred during the Warsaw talks" and was "purely accidental."

    However, people know much more about the "accidental incident" from American and other foreign news agencies than Dulles said. These many accidental incidents included U.S. Pacific Commander Felt and Pacific Air Force Commander Carter discussing attacks on mainland China and increasing supplies to the Chiang army with Chiang Kai-shek on the 22nd and 23rd; not long before this, there had been repeated news that the United States had delivered new weapons to the Chiang army. Recently, U.S. Marine Corps Commander General Pate, Marine Corps Chief of Operations Brigadier General Greene, and Chief of Logistics Major General Gulick visited Taiwan and held talks with senior generals of the Chiang army. Commander of the U.S. forces in Taiwan, Lieutenant General Smoot, held talks with Chen Cheng, the administrative president of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to leaked news, the United States will supply the Chiang army with 17,000-ton light landing craft, and the United States is transporting new missiles and howitzers to the Chiang army; on the 30th, the U.S. military command in Taiwan also confirmed that the U.S. Marine Corps had gone to Jinmen Island to help the Chiang army install eight-inch howitzers; preparations are being made to supply C-119 transport aircraft, and it is planned that U.S. "civil aviation" personnel will participate in airdrops, and so on.

    Could all of this be so-called "purely accidental incidents" rather than the United States further implementing its policy of providing guns and cannons and ordering the Chiang army to act as a vanguard for attacking the mainland? Is it not the United States continuing to strengthen its control over Jinmen and Mazu as stepping stones for attacking the mainland? Does it not fully expose that U.S. imperialism has no remorse for its dangerous provocative actions? It is especially meaningful that, according to a report by United Press International Warsaw correspondent Shields on the 29th, the United States directed Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft to use "Sidewinder" missiles in order to increase "Ambassador Beam's capital" and "may make Beam's mission easier," and Beam's so-called mission is to persuade Wang Bingnan to agree to a "ceasefire"!

    Obviously, the American aggressors are once again trotting out the old tricks from the Korean armistice negotiations. In the Korean negotiations, whenever its absurd demands were refuted at the conference table, the American aggressors vainly attempted to use military threats to force our side to make concessions. On the one hand, the American aggressors are now stealing the phrase "peaceful settlement of international disputes" to cover up the essence of its "ceasefire" conspiracy to expand aggression; on the other hand, they are expanding aggressive military deployments, intensifying military provocations, and even using new weapons that have never been used in the history of war to intensify threats to the Chinese people. However, this trick of the American aggressors has proven to be wishful thinking in the past, and it still is now! The Chinese people will never be intimidated by a few ships, a few airplanes, or a few missiles from the United States. On the contrary, the crimes committed by the American aggressors through the bloody hands of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the crazy provocations, and the preparations for a new war will only further enrage the 600 million Chinese people, making them more determined to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek bandit pilots and crush all the provocations of U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists bully us so much that we need to deal with it seriously." Our powerful People's Liberation Army, following the National Day speech of Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, is "ready at all times to resolutely give the Chiang Kai-shek army of traitors and murderers a severe punishment, and give the enemy who dares to invade our motherland a devastating blow!" Hundreds of millions of young men and women across the country are enthusiastically participating in the militia and have already armed themselves. In the capital alone, fifty divisions have been formed, and hundreds and thousands of militia divisions across the country will surely make it impossible for the aggressors to move an inch.

    The Sidewinder missile has been launched! However, at this very moment, Dulles said at a press conference that "the situation has a slight tendency to stabilize" and that "the possibility of increased and expanded hostile actions" has "decreased." He is truly lying to our faces. The fact is that the United States is continuing to play with fire and expand its aggressive activities, making the Taiwan crisis not easing but intensifying. Now people all over the world will see more clearly that the current issue is not a "ceasefire" issue, but that the United States must immediately stop all provocations against the Chinese people and withdraw all U.S. armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait!

    这也叫做“偶然事件”！
    本报评论员
    美国指使蒋介石空军使用“响尾蛇”式导弹进攻大陆空军的罪行，已经由美国的通讯社纷纷供认不讳。杜勒斯也不得不在30日的记者招待会上承认了美国的确供给了蒋介石集团以“响尾蛇”式导弹。但是他却妄图推卸责任，说什么蒋介石的飞机使用“响尾蛇”式导弹的事件在“华沙会谈期间发生”，“那纯粹是偶然的”。
    但是，人们从美国通讯社和别的外国通讯社所知道的“偶然事件”却比杜勒斯所说的多得多。这许多偶然事件里，包括了美国的太平洋区美军总司令费耳特、太平洋区空军总司令卡特在22日、23日同蒋介石商量了对中国大陆的进攻和增加供应蒋军装备的问题；在此以前不久，已经屡次有消息说，美国把新式武器运交了蒋军。近日又有美国海军陆战队司令培特上将、陆战队主管作战的格林尼少将、主管补给的古立克少将等到了台湾，同蒋军高级将领举行会谈，侵台美军司令斯摩特中将同蒋介石集团的行政院长陈诚等会谈，据传出的消息说，美国将供给蒋军一万七千吨位的轻型登陆艇，美国正在给蒋军运送新的导弹和榴弹炮；30日侵台美军司令部又证实了美国海军陆战队曾到金门岛帮助蒋军安装八英寸口径的榴弹炮；准备供给C—119型的运输机，并打算由美国“民航”人员参加空投，等等。
    难道所有这一切，都是所谓“纯粹偶然的事件”、而不是美国进一步在执行出枪出炮、命令蒋军作为进攻大陆前锋的政策吗？而不是美国继续在加强对金门、马祖的控制，作为进攻大陆的跳板吗？难道不是充分暴露了美帝国主义对于它的这种危险的挑衅行动，并无悔祸之心吗？意味尤其深长的是，据合众国际社华沙记者薛尔兹29日报道，美国指使蒋介石飞机使用“响尾蛇”式导弹，是为了增加“美国大使比姆的资本”，“可能会使比姆的任务容易一些”，而比姆的所谓任务，就是劝王炳南同意“停火”！
    显然，美国侵略者又在搬出朝鲜停战谈判中的老一套把戏了。在朝鲜谈判中，美国侵略者每当它的荒谬要求在会议桌上被驳倒以后，就妄想用武力威胁来迫使我方让步。美国侵略者现在一方面在盗用“和平方法解决国际争端”的词令，掩盖它的“停火”阴谋以扩大侵略的实质，另一方面却在扩大侵略军事部署，加紧军事挑衅，甚至使用战争史上所从未用过的新式武器来加紧威胁中国人民。但是，美国侵略者的这种伎俩，过去证明是妄想，现在也还是妄想！中国人民决不是美国的几条船、几架飞机、几颗导弹所能吓倒的。相反的，美国侵略者通过蒋介石集团的血手干出的罪行，疯狂的挑衅以及新战争的准备，只会更加激怒中国六亿人民，使他们更坚决地严惩蒋介石飞贼，粉碎美帝国主义的一切挑衅。毛主席说：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”我国强大的人民解放军，遵循着国防部长彭德怀国庆讲话，“时刻准备好，坚决给卖国残民的蒋介石军队以严厉的惩罚，给胆敢侵犯我们祖国的敌人以毁灭性的打击！”我全国亿万青壮年男女踊跃参加民兵，已经武装起来。只是首都一地就组成了五十个师，全国成百成千成万的民兵师，必将使得侵略者寸步难行。
    响尾蛇导弹已经发射了！可是，就在这个时刻，杜勒斯却在记者招待会上说：“局势稍稍有稳定的趋势”，“敌对行动增加和扩大的可能性”“减少了”。真是当面扯谎。事实是美国在继续玩火，扩大侵略的活动，使得台湾危机不是缓和而是加剧了。现在全世界的人们会更加清醒地看到，目前的问题不是什么“停火”问题，而是美国必须立即停止对中国人民的一切挑衅，并且把美国的一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤出去！
