Speaking of the teaching and research institute's rabbit farm, which has grown from seven rabbits to three hundred and seventy-five rabbits, people naturally think of first-class disabled soldier Wen Hequn.

In February of last year, when the organization called on everyone to raise rabbits, he took the lead in feeding seven rabbits. Regardless of wind or rain, he always carried a basket, limping and hobbling to the fields and ditches seven or eight li away to cut grass for the rabbits. Once, Wen Hequn carried forty or fifty jin of grass back from the field. When crossing the railway, he had only climbed two steps when his legs began to tremble, and he rolled down together with the grass. He tried to climb up three times but couldn't get past. He was so anxious that he stamped his feet. What should he do? He thought, he had to carry it back no matter what, otherwise the rabbits would go hungry. He gritted his teeth and climbed up again, dripping with sweat with every step. It took him a full five minutes to climb over. By this time, he was drenched in sweat.

When feeding the rabbits, Wen Hequn often said to others, "People who are not fed or clothed well can speak, but rabbits can't speak, so they should be taken care of more carefully." In December of last year, more than thirty female rabbits were about to give birth (by this time, the number of rabbits had grown to more than eighty, and the number of breeders had increased to five), so he gathered these rabbits into a clean room and lit a stove for them. He was afraid that the baby rabbits would be unattended at night, so he volunteered to take the night shift. Under his patient care, the survival rate of this batch of baby rabbits reached 70%, an increase of 10% compared to the summer.

    温合群和他的兔子
    提起从七只兔子发展到三百七十五只兔子的教养院养兔场，人们自然就会想到一等残废军人温合群来。
    在去年2月，组织上号召大家饲养兔子时，他就带头喂了七只兔子。不管刮风下雨，他总是提着篮子，一跛一拐地到相距七、八里的地头上、河沟里去给兔子割草。有一次，温合群背了四、五十斤草从地里回来，在过铁路时，刚爬了两步，两腿就打起颤来，连人带草一齐滚了下来，一连爬了三次都没有过去，他急得直跺脚，怎么办呢？他想，无论如何也得把它背回去，不然兔子就要挨饿。他把牙一咬再往上爬，一步一滴汗，足足费了五分多钟的时间才爬了过去，这时，他全身已汗如雨下。
    温合群在喂兔子时，常对别人说：“人吃不饱穿不暖会说话，兔子不会说话，更应该细心地看护它。”去年12月，有三十多只母兔要生产了（这时兔子已发展到八十多只，饲养员增加到五人），他就把这些兔子集中到一个干净的屋子里，给它们生起了炉火。他怕夜间生小兔无人看管，就自告奋勇参加值夜班。在他的耐心照顾下，这一次兔羔的成活率达到了70％，比夏天增加了10％。
