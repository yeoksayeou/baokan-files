Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 26th - Guizhou Province, known for its barren and high-altitude terrain, has fundamentally solved its grain problem this year amidst an all-round leap forward in agricultural production. The total output of 24 million mu of grain crops in the province has doubled compared to last year, reaching 21 billion jin, exceeding the target of 800 jin per mu set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule. Furthermore, more than 20 counties have achieved grain yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. The average grain possession per person in the province has increased from 624 jin last year to over 1,200 jin.

Various major economic crops, whether tobacco, hemp, silk, tea, or oilseeds and cotton, have all increased in production. The total output of cured tobacco reached 2.4 million dan, more than double that of last year. Counties such as Zunyi and Guiding have seen many high-yield "satellites" with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu. People have always believed that sweet potatoes and cotton cannot be grown in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, but this year, the province's first trial planting of more than 20,000 mu of sweet potatoes achieved an average yield of more than 4,700 jin per mu.

Guizhou Province has high mountains, thin soil, and frequent natural disasters. From the perspective of those who emphasize conditions, this year's increase in production would have been impossible. However, under the leadership of the Party, farmers of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have used soaring enthusiasm to create the conditions for a great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Because the mountains are high and water is scarce, people have built ponds and dug canals, split mountains to divert water, and constructed water conservancy projects capable of irrigating more than 15 million mu of land, equivalent to 4.8 times the total irrigated area achieved in the thousands of years before liberation. Because the soil is barren, everyone has taken action to apply nearly 50,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land; they have also carried out soil improvement on more than 6 million mu of poor land, changing the name and nature of the poor soil. After the start of spring plowing, the entire province was threatened by drought, and some areas suffered from continuous drought for as long as half a year. However, thanks to the heroic spirit of the broad masses of people who insisted on "watering with sweat if there is no water to irrigate" and "ensuring a bumper harvest without rain," they finally overcame the natural disasters and basically ensured full planting.

Throughout the entire production process, various regions have carried out an agricultural technical revolution centered on deep plowing and close planting, fundamentally changing the centuries-old practice of extensive cultivation and low yields. Taking rice as an example, although the planting area has shrunk by 13% compared to last year, due to intensive cultivation, the yield per mu has increased by 200 jin, and the total output has increased by 28.3% compared to last year. The Changzheng People's Commune in the suburbs of the historical city of Zunyi also launched a "satellite" with a rice yield of 40,019 jin per mu. Due to changes in primitive farming methods, the total grain output of the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture has doubled compared to last year, with an average of more than 1,500 jin of grain per person.

    贵州粮食产量加番
    提前实现农业纲要平均亩产八百斤
    新华社贵阳26日电　以贫瘠高寒著称的贵州省，今年在农业生产全面跃进中从根本上解决了粮食问题。全省二千四百万亩粮食作物总产量比去年翻了一番，达到二百一十亿斤，提前超额实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的亩产八百斤的指标，并且出现了二十多个粮食亩产千斤县。全省平均每人占有粮食由去年的六百二十四斤上升到一千二百多斤。
    各种主要经济作物，不论烟、麻、丝、茶或油料、棉花，样样增产。烤烟总产量达二百四十万担，比去年增加两倍多，遵义、贵定等县出现了不少亩产万斤以上的高产“卫星”。人们历来认为贵州山区不能种甜菜、棉花，但今年全省第一次试种的二万多亩甜菜，平均亩产四千七百多斤。
    贵州省山高土瘦，自然灾害较多，从条件论者的眼中来看，今年增产是不可能的。可是山区各族农民今年在党的领导下，用冲天干劲来创造了农业生产大跃进的条件。山高缺水，人们就修塘挖渠，劈山引水，建成了能灌田一千五百多万亩的水利工程，相当于解放前几千年间所达到的灌溉总面积的四点八倍。土壤瘠薄，大家就动手为每亩耕地施肥近五万斤；还对六百多万亩瘦地进行土壤改良，叫瘦土改名换姓。春耕开始后，全省受到干旱威胁，部分地区连续受旱半年之久。但由于广大群众以“没有水浇用汗浇”、“无雨保丰收”的英雄气概来抗旱，终于战胜了自然灾害，基本上保证了满栽满插。
    在整个生产过程中，各地开展了以深耕、密植为中心的农业技术革命，从根本上改变了千百年来耕作粗放、广种薄收的面貌。以水稻为例，种植面积虽然比去年缩小13％，但由于精耕细作，亩产量增加了二百斤，总产比去年增加28.3％。历史名城遵义市郊区长征人民公社还放出水稻亩产四万零一十九斤的“卫星”。黔东南苗族侗族自治州由于改变了原始耕作方法，粮食总产量比去年增加一倍，平均每人有粮食一千五百斤以上。
