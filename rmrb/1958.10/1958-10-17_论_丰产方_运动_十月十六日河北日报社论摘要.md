An agricultural production innovation, a valuable seed of socialist large-scale production, the "High-Yield Square" movement under the great leap forward in agricultural production has blossomed and borne fruit this year on the land of Cheng'an County in our province.

The "High-Yield Square" movement proves that agriculture has begun a major production transformation, that is, from the revolution of points to the revolution of the whole area, from scattered small plots to a new stage of large-scale collective farming and large-area high-yield production. The farming methods inherited from the era of small-scale peasant economy for many years are gone forever.

With the transformation of production, the corresponding changes in labor organization are inevitable. Where should labor organization change? It should become more collectivized, more combative, and more capable of undertaking the task of revolutionary transformation in agricultural production, and create certain conditions for the soon-to-be-realized mechanized large-scale production. How to change? The "High-Yield Square" movement enlightened us to use the "square." According to the requirements of concentrated planting in the "High-Yield Square," the members of the production organization are organized in a military manner. The members operating the "High-Yield Square" are concentrated together, with unified thinking, unified organization, and unified action, and have a high degree of labor efficiency. Therefore, they can most effectively complete the task of large-area yield increase and promote the revolution in production.

The "High-Yield Square" movement also proves that the broad masses of peasants have embarked on the broad road of being both red and expert, and becoming new communist people. To carry out the "High-Yield Square" movement, on the one hand, we must rely on red and expert activists to launch a resolute struggle against conservative thinking to enable the experience of experimental fields to achieve victory in the production revolution. On the other hand, to ensure a bumper harvest, we must have a huge team of red and expert activists who master advanced agricultural technology. The red and expert team in Cheng'an County's "High-Yield Square" is growing. These young men and women can now talk to others about politics, technology, and culture.

The "High-Yield Square" movement also proves that taking the "square" as the position to engage in large-area high-yield production is a leadership method that adapts to the mass line after communization. After communization, leadership is generally implemented according to the original methods of leading small cooperatives. Because the cooperative is large and production is dispersed, and it includes all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, there are some difficulties in carrying out political work, launching labor competitions, and disseminating technology. However, after the establishment of the "High-Yield Square," this situation has undergone great changes. The "square" is not only a production unit, but also a political and cultural center; it includes not only production, but also life; it is not only concentrated, but also a tightly organized whole. Therefore, with the "square," the leadership has a base point. Within the scope of the "square," it can effectively carry out political work, launch labor competitions, organize red and expert studies, disseminate production technology, and combine labor and military affairs, and thus can effectively do a good job in production.

To establish a "High-Yield Square," the first thing to do is to make a comprehensive plan. In accordance with the spirit of striving for a greater leap forward in production, we must make full use of the favorable conditions of the People's Commune, divide various crops into "squares" for planting, and manage them according to the "square." All kinds of production and construction of the cooperative should be planned and arranged with the "square" as the center, and the work of other departments should also be oriented to the "High-Yield Square" to meet the needs of large-area high-yield production in the "High-Yield Square."

    论“丰产方”运动
    十月十六日河北日报社论摘要
    一项农业生产上的创举，一个社会主义大生产的可贵萌芽，农业生产大跃进形势下的“丰产方”运动，今年在我省成安县的土地上已经开花结果了。
    “丰产方”运动证明了：农业已经开始了一个生产上的大变革，即由点的革命进入到面的革命，由分散的小块到大规模的集体耕作和大面积的高额丰产的新阶段。那种多年来传留下来的小农经济时代的耕作方法，已经一去不复返了。
    随着生产上的变革，劳力组织的相应变化是必然的。劳力组织要变向哪里去？就是要更加集体化、更加战斗化，更能担负起农业生产上革命变革的任务，并为不久即能实现的机械化大生产创造一定的条件。怎样变法？“丰产方”运动启示了我们，要通过“方”。根据“丰产方”种植集中的要求，生产组织的成员是按军事化的方法组织起来的，经营“丰产方”的成员集中一起，思想统一，组织统一，行动统一，有高度的劳动效率，因而也就最能有效地完成大面积增产任务，促进生产上的革命。
    “丰产方”运动还证明了：广大农民群众已踏上了又红又专、作一个共产主义新人的康庄大道。开展“丰产方”运动，一方面，只有依靠红专积极分子向保守思想展开坚决的斗争，才能使试验田的经验能够取得生产革命的胜利；另方面，想确保丰收，就要有一支巨大的掌握先进的农业技术的红专积极分子队伍。成安县“丰产方”里的红专队伍正在成长，这群青年男女们，现在能和别人讲政治、说技术、谈文化了。
    “丰产方”运动也证明了：以“方”为阵地，搞大面积丰产，是适应公社化以后群众路线的领导方法。在公社化后，一般仍是按原来领导小社的方法实行领导的。由于社大生产分散，又包括工农商学兵等各个方面，进行政治工作、开展劳动竞赛以及传播技术等都遇到一些困难。而在建立了“丰产方”以后，这种情况就发生很大的变化。“方”不仅是一个生产单位，而且是一个政治、文化中心；不仅包括生产方面，也包括生活方面；不仅集中，而且又是有严密组织的整体。所以，有了“方”，领导就有了基点，在“方”的范围内，可以有效地进行政治工作，开展劳动竞赛，组织红专学习，传播生产技术，进行劳武结合，因而也就能够有效地搞好生产。
    建立“丰产方”首先要做好全面规划。要根据争取生产更大跃进的精神，充分利用人民公社的有利条件，将各种作物划“方”种植，并按“方”实行管理。社的各种生产建设都要以“方”为中心进行规划安排，其他部门的工作也应当面向“丰产方”，适应“丰产方”的大面积丰产的需要。
