    Cannot Introduce Bad Films This Way
    After reading the articles in the People's Daily criticizing the films "Storm on the Court" and "Youth's Footsteps," I completely agree with their opinions. Indeed, some films beautify the bourgeoisie, and we must resolutely oppose this tendency.
    However, the film screening work must also be strengthened ideologically and be responsible to the people. Take Tangshan Xinhua Cinema as an example. This cinema often introduces the films to be screened, and some of these introductions are very irresponsible.
    The film "Deep Affection" had already been criticized when it was shown in other cities, but Tangshan Xinhua Cinema still introduced it to the audience as a moving depiction of the friendship between two scientists, full of human touch, etc. How can we allow things that should be criticized in the film to be introduced to the audience as advantages? A few days ago, I heard them introduce "Seeking Love" in the form of a clapper talk, still using vulgar matchmaking and low-level jokes as the main content of the introduction, while not mentioning the shortcomings of the film "Seeking Love" at all.
    Of course, it is not that criticized films are not allowed to be introduced. The question is how to introduce them. For bad films, we cannot avoid talking about the shortcomings in order to avoid affecting attendance!

    不能这样介绍坏影片
    我看了人民日报上批判影片“球场风波”、“青春的脚步”的文章后，完全同意他们的意见，的确，在一些影片中美化了资产阶级，我们要坚决反对这种倾向。
    但是影片的放映工作也必须加强思想性，必须对人民负责。以唐山新华影院为例，这个影院经常对将要放映的片子加以介绍，其中有一些是很不负责任的。
    影片“情长谊深”在其他城市上演时早已受过批判，但唐山新华影院却仍然向观众介绍什么影片动人地描写了两个科学家的友谊，富有人情味等等。我们怎么能够允许把影片中应该批判的东西还当作优点介绍给观众呢？前几天听他们用快板形式介绍“寻爱记”，仍然是以庸俗的，找对象和低级笑料作为介绍的主要内容，而对影片“寻爱记”的缺点则只字不提。
    当然受批判的影片不是说不许介绍了，问题是怎样介绍，对于不好的影片不能为了怕影响上座而不谈缺点！
