Hunan Women Take on the Task of Winter Cultivation and Sowing
　　8 Million People Work in the Fields Daily, Deep Plowing Progress Exceeds Previous Years
　　(Our newspaper, Changsha, 11th dispatch) The vast number of rural women in Hunan Province are diligently practicing production techniques and actively participating in labor, becoming a main force on the agricultural production front. According to statistics at the end of September, more than 10.015 million women in the province worked every day, accounting for 64% of the total rural female population, more than double the number of workers in the same period last year. Among them, about 8 million women participated in agricultural production, accounting for 80% of the current total number of agricultural workers. Women have become the main force on the current agricultural production front.
　　As women have taken over agricultural production, all localities have paid attention to the rational arrangement of labor. Although 40% of the male labor force in the province's rural areas (about 6 million people) was transferred to steel production, the province's winter cultivation and sowing work is advancing at a rate of nearly one million mu per day, faster than any previous year.
  At present, more than 20 million mu of mid-season rice in the province has been harvested, and more than 10 million mu of winter crops such as rapeseed and wheat have been planted, completing 30% of the winter sowing plan. The average daily increase in fertilizer accumulation is 600 million dan. More than 9.38 million mu of cultivated land in the province has been deeply plowed to a depth of six inches or more. About one million people are engaged in winter water conservancy projects every day. All parts of the province have basically achieved the goal of not delaying both steel and grain production.
　　After the realization of people's communes throughout the province at the end of September, public canteens and nurseries were generally established in various places, liberating the vast number of women from housework, and the problem of women's participation in labor has been basically solved. However, at that time, many people did not see the strength of women, always thinking that women were "stuck at the stove," did not understand agricultural technology, and could only do some rough work. If they were to be the main force in agricultural production, it would certainly not be done well. Many women also lacked confidence, fearing that they would not be able to do a good job in production and would be ridiculed. In view of this situation, many local party committees promptly launched a large-scale debate among the masses, criticizing the idea of underestimating women's labor force. At the same time, they adopted the method of old peasants teaching apprentices and learning by doing, to help women learn basic agricultural work such as plowing and sowing. In Shaoyang Prefecture, the province's iron and steel base, party secretaries at all levels personally took charge of this work. 400,000 women in the area quickly learned more than two agricultural operating techniques and took on winter production tasks. Therefore, the area's one million-strong steel army can concentrate on production without any worries. More than 40,000 young and middle-aged women in Yizhang County launched a learning upsurge of "everyone learns technology, everyone becomes an expert." 80% of the women in the county have quickly learned basic agricultural work such as plowing and land preparation, and many women have become "all-rounders." In the model worker evaluation meetings of various people's communes in early October, more than 9,000 women in the county were rated as experts in rice, sweet potato, pig farming, and other productions.
　　The diligence and hard work of the vast number of women quickly broke many outdated ideas that underestimated women. After Piaochang Township People's Commune in Shaodong County transferred 3,000 laborers to steel production, only women and semi-laborers were left at home. At that time, it was calculated that it would take 96 days to complete the winter cultivation and sowing tasks, which would not be in time for the season. Some people advocated mobilizing women; others thought that relying on women was not as good as reducing the winter planting area. Yang Yin, the secretary of the township party committee, supported the first opinion. First, he asked old peasants to teach women how to plow in the commune. In three days, 786 women learned how to plow, and the women's enthusiasm increased even more. The number of people attending work every day increased from more than 1,800 to more than 3,600. After 22 days and nights of hard work, they completed the winter cultivation and sowing tasks of more than 10,000 mu of land in the commune. Not only did they plow deeply to about one chi, but also all the crops caught up with the sowing season.

### 湖南妇女挑起冬耕冬播担子  每天八百万人下田劳动，深耕进度超过往年

    湖南妇女挑起冬耕冬播担子
    每天八百万人下田劳动，深耕进度超过往年
    本报长沙11日电　湖南广大农村妇女苦练生产技术，积极参加劳动，已成为农业生产战线上的一支主力军。9月底统计，全省每天出工的妇女有一千零一十五万多人，占农村妇女总人口的64％，较去年同期出工人数增加一倍以上。其中参加农业生产的妇女约有八百万人，占目前农业出工总人数的80％，妇女已成为当前农业生产战线上的主力军了。
    由于妇女接替了农业生产，各地都注意了合理安排劳动力，全省农村虽抽走了40％的男劳力（约六百多万人）搞钢铁生产，全省冬耕播种工作却以每天完成近一百万亩的速度跃进，比以往任何年都快。
  目前，全省两千多万亩中稻收割完毕，还播种油菜、小麦等冬作物一千多万亩，完成冬播计划30％。积肥平均每天增长六亿担。全省深耕六寸以上的耕地有九百三十八万多亩。每天约有一百万人投入冬修水利运动。全省各地基本上做到了钢铁、粮食生产两不误。
    9月底，全省实现人民公社化后，各地普遍办起公共食堂、托儿所，使广大妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，妇女参加劳动的问题已基本解决了。但是，当时很多人看不到妇女的力量，总认为妇女是“站灶湾”的，不懂农业技术，附带干点粗活差不多，要以她们为主力搞农业生产，一定搞不好。妇女中也有不少人缺乏信心，怕搞不好生产，惹人耻笑。根据这种情况，很多地方党委及时在群众中展开了大辩论，批判了轻视妇女劳动力的思想。同时，采取老农带徒弟、边学边做的办法，帮助妇女学会犁田、播种等基本农活。全省炼铁基地的邵阳专区，各级党委书记亲自挂帅领导了这一工作，全区有四十万名妇女很快学会了两门以上的农业操作技术，把冬季生产任务担当起来。因此，全区一百万钢铁大军可以无后顾之忧，安心生产。宜章县四万多名青壮年妇女掀起“人人学技术，个个当能手”的学习高潮。全县已有80％的妇女很快学会犁田、整地等基本农活，而且有很多妇女成为“多面手”。在10月初，各人民公社的评模会上，全县九千多名妇女被评为水稻、红薯、养猪等各项生产的能手。
    广大妇女的勤劳、苦干精神，很快打破了许多轻视妇女的陈腐观念。邵东县瓢厂乡人民公社抽出三千劳力搞钢铁生产后，家里只剩下妇女和半劳力。当时计算冬耕播种任务要九十六天才能完成，赶不上季节。有人主张发动妇女；有人却认为靠妇女，还不如压缩冬种面积。乡党委书记杨荫支持第一个意见，首先在社里请老农教妇女犁田，三天就有七百八十六名妇女学会了犁田，妇女劲头更大了，每天出勤人数由一千八百多人增加到三千六百多人。苦战二十二昼夜就突击完成全社一万多亩田的冬耕播种任务。不仅深耕达一尺左右，而且作物都赶上了播种季节。
