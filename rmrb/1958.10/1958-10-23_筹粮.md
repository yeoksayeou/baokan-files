Procuring Grain

By Our Reporter Fang Chen

(I)
Not afraid of the scorching sun, who fears the roaring wind?
Split open Phoenix Mountain, dig out treasures for ten thousand years!
Molten iron flows into rivers, "iron oxen" run all over the land...

From Gaobeidian to the mountainous areas of Laishui County, crowds of people and vehicles carrying bedding and iron picks, mixed with the laughter and singing of men and women, like a torrent of ten thousand horses, rushed non-stop towards the western mountain mining area from morning till night.

Leaving Laishui city and walking not far, one arrives at Phoenix Mountain. Standing on Phoenix Slope and looking up at the peak nearly a thousand meters above sea level is truly breathtaking. Layers of people wriggle on the steep mountainside, and the sound of impacting rocks echoes up and down the mountain. Suddenly, bugle calls sound in unison, and the dense crowds of people hide in the gullies. A series of booming explosions shakes people's eardrums, and immediately plumes of smoke rush into the sky, and the cliffs collapse. The people hiding in the gullies rush towards the peaks from all directions. After the major blasting, a tense battle of moving ore and transporting stone begins again.

The Phoenix Mountain iron ore area in Laishui County includes eight mountain peaks, including Mopan Mountain, Jingshan Dream, Touding Mountain, and Sijianyu, winding for more than twenty *li* from east to west. Beneath these undulating hills lies a wealth of iron ore. Here, regardless of sunny or rainy days, more than 13,000 agricultural commune members, workers, government cadres, and citizens from the plains of Dingxing, Zhuozhou, Xiongxian, Baoding City, and Laishui County are splitting mountains and digging mines every day. Using hand hammers, steel chisels, and carrying baskets, they dig out thousands of tons of iron ore every day to supply iron smelting plants in six counties and cities, including Laishui County, Zhuozhou County, Dingxing County, and Baoding City.

When you pantingly climb to the top of the steep mountain and look around, you will be moved by the amazing labor scene. You can see thousands of straw hats swaying on the cliffs cut off halfway up each mountain peak; hundreds of tons of dark brown iron ore pour down the natural "chutes" formed by the slopes, like landslides, from the mountains into the ore storage yards below.

"However many blast furnaces are built, we guarantee to supply enough iron ore!" No matter who you ask among those participating in the mining, whether it is a gray-haired old man or a sun-tanned, red-faced young girl, they will answer you like this. In order to seize every minute, many people secretly stuff a few steamed buns in their pockets before starting the early shift, and instead of going down the mountain at noon, they take a few bites of steamed buns, drink some water, and then continue working. Even Uncle Yang, who is over half a century old, bares his chest like the young men, carrying over a hundred *jin* of ore, constantly turning it up and down. Zhang Shuntang, the comrade in charge of the migrant worker team, told me a moving story about this kind old man:

Uncle Yang's given name is Yang Tian. One morning in early August, upon hearing that there was iron ore in the Western Mountains, young men eagerly signed up to go up the mountain to mine ore and smelt iron. This old farmer, who had worked the land all his life, thought that with iron ore, they could smelt steel and manufacture agricultural machinery, so that they would no longer suffer from pulling plows and harrows. His eyes turned red, and without consulting his wife, he signed up with the young men. The township cadres were afraid that he was too old and the mining work was too heavy, so they did not approve it. When Uncle Yang returned home, he borrowed a razor and shaved off his silver-gray beard in one go. The next morning, he went to the township to sign up again. The township cadres still advised him not to go because of his age, but he got angry and started arguing. Those who didn't know what was going on ran over to mediate and asked, "Old man, what do you want!" Yang Tian said angrily, "I want steel, I want 'iron oxen' to pull plows, machines to cultivate the land, what do you think I want?" The migrant workers affectionately call him the old hero Uncle Yang.

Women are quite famous in this mining site. Although most of them are housewives from the plains, rural areas, and cities, and some have never seen a mountain before, they work as fiercely as young men. The migrant workers admiringly call them "those who make Mu Guiying angry."

The mining faces are very steep small roads. Even people with empty hands inevitably fall if they are not careful while walking here. However, they carry heavy ore and walk as fast as "flying on grass." Yang Xuerong and Zhang Yongzhi are both eighteen or nineteen-year-old rural girls. When they first arrived in the mining area, their feet slipped when climbing a not-so-steep slope. In just seven or eight days, they were like girls from mountain villages, carrying a large basket of more than two hundred *jin* of ore, running fast on the steep trails. While others carry two loads, they carry three or four loads. People worry that they will slip and advise them to carry less and walk slower. Yang Xuerong always says with a smile, "Whenever I think of molten iron flowing from the blast furnace and machines running all over the land, my feet grow wings and start running." Now she has also learned how to drill holes and use steel chisels, and has become the deputy leader of the women's "steel" team. On the Jingshan mining site, you will always see a short migrant worker jumping nimbly on the rocks split open halfway up the mountain, loading explosives and installing fuses, attracted by her skillful movements. Who would believe that just half a month ago, she was a rural girl, Wang Fengru, who would quickly cover her ears with her hands when she saw children setting off firecrackers.

These people are just the "auxiliary labor force" on the mining site. Speaking of the main force – the commune members, workers, and government cadres – their enthusiasm is even more indescribable.

(III)
"Dig more ore to ensure that the iron smelting furnace has ample grain." Whether in the mining area or in the surrounding small mountain villages, you will have this strong feeling. Around this mining area, there are only ten or so small mountain villages with one or two hundred households. Suddenly adding more than 10,000 people, accommodation is a thorny problem. However, the migrant workers do not live in shacks, but in bright and spacious "workshops." Wang Suozhu, the person in charge of migrant workers in Laishui County, told me: As long as the farmers in this area hear about splitting mountains and mining iron ore, they will automatically help solve whatever you lack. When the migrant workers first arrived at the construction site and had no place to live, the farmers in each village automatically moved their families into one or two small rooms, leaving the largest and best houses for the migrant workers to live in. Every evening, the courtyard of the migrant workers' kitchen is crowded with female commune members, each bringing a large basket full of vegetables such as winter melon, zucchini, eggplant, and beans that they have saved up for the migrant workers. Vegetables that are rarely eaten in the farmers' public canteens are piled up here. I asked an old woman, "You've brought all the vegetables here, what do you eat?" But she said very simply: "Working in the fields is easier than mining. Let the young men eat their fill so they can mine more ore."

    “筹粮”
    本报记者　方辰
    （一）
    不怕烈日晒　谁惧狂风号
    劈开凤凰山　挖出万年宝
    铁水流成河　“铁牛”遍地跑……
    从高碑店到涞水县山区的公路上，背着铺盖、铁镐的人群、车辆，加杂着男女的笑声和歌声，像万马奔腾的激流，从早到晚不停地奔向西山采矿区。
    出了涞水城走不远，便是凤凰山。站在凤凰坡上仰望拔海约有千公尺高的山峰，真是惊心动魄。在陡坡的山腰里蠕动着一层层的人群，山上山下一片冲击岩石的铿锵声。突然军号四起，密密层层的人群纷纷躲到山沟里，一排轰轰的爆破声，震得人们的耳膜鸣鸣发响，顿时一股股烟柱冲上天空，山崖土崩瓦解了。躲在山沟里面的人们，从四面八方奔向山峰。大爆破以后，一场紧张的搬运矿石、运石方的战斗又开始了。
    涞水县凤凰山铁矿区，包括磨盘山、景山梦、头顶山、四涧峪等八座山头，东西蜿蜒二十多华里。就在这起伏不平的山岗下面，蕴藏着丰富的铁矿。在这里，不管晴天和雨天，每天都有来自定兴、涿县、雄县、保定市和涞水等县平原地区的一万三千多名农业社员、工人、机关干部和市民劈山挖矿，他们用手锤、钢钎、抬筐，每天从这里挖出上千百吨的铁矿石，供给涞水县、涿县、定兴和保定市等六个县市炼铁厂。
    当你气喘吁吁地爬上陡坡的山顶，环视四周，便会被惊人的劳动场面所感动。只见在各座山峰的半山腰被削掉的绝壁上，几千只草帽晃动；成百吨的黑褐色铁矿石，像山崩一样顺着山坡形成的自然“溜槽”，从山上倾入山下储矿仓。
    （二）
    “高炉建多少，保证供给多少足够的铁石”，随便你问参加采矿的哪个人，是白发苍苍的老伯伯，或是被晒得黑油油满面红光的年轻姑娘，都会这样回答你。他们为了争取每一分钟，很多人在上早班以前，偷偷地装在口袋里几个馒头，中午下班不上山，在工地上啃几口馒头、喝点水接着又干。就连年过半百的杨老伯也和年轻小伙子一样，光着膀子，抬着一百多斤重的矿石，不停地上下翻转，民工带队的负责人张顺堂同志告诉我这位慈祥的老人的一段动人故事：
    杨大伯的大号叫杨田。8月初，一天早晨，听说西山有铁矿，年轻小伙子纷纷报名上山采矿炼铁，这位干了一辈庄稼活的老农，想起有了铁矿，就能炼钢铁，制造农业机器，再也不受拉犁拉耙之苦了，也红了眼，他没顾得和老伴商量，就跟着年轻小伙子们一起报名。乡干部怕他年纪老了，采矿的活太重没批准。杨大伯回到家里，借了一把剃头刀，一口气把银灰色的胡须剃得精光。第二天一早又去乡里报名，乡干部为了照顾他这大年纪还是劝他不去，他气得吵起来，不明究竟的人，跑去劝架问：老大爷你要什么啊！杨田气虎虎地说：“我要钢铁，要‘铁牛’拉犁，机器种地，你说我要什么？”民工们都亲切地称他老英雄杨大伯。
    妇女，在这个采矿场很有点名气。她们虽然大部分都是来自平原农村、城市的家庭妇女，有些人还是有生以来第一次看见山，劳动起来却和小伙子一样猛，民工们都佩服地称呼她们是“气死穆桂英”。
    采矿工作面都是很陡的小路，就是空手的人从这里走，稍微不小心还免不了摔跤，可是，她们抬着很重的矿石，走起来却像“草上飞”一样的快。杨雪荣和张永芝两人都是十八、九岁的农村姑娘，才到矿区时，爬个不太陡的山坡，两脚还打滑。只七、八天的时间，她们却像山村的姑娘一样，抬着二百多斤重的一大筐矿石，在陡坡的小道上走起来飞跑，别人抬两趟的时间，她两就抬三、四趟。人们担心她们滑倒了，劝她们少抬点，走慢些，杨雪荣总是笑嘻嘻地说：“我一想起高炉铁水流，机器遍地跑，两脚像长了翅膀一样就跑起来。”现在她还学会了打眼、把钎技术活，成了妇女“钢铁”班的副班长。在景山采矿场上，总会看见一个矮个子民工，在半山腰被劈开的岩石上敏捷地跳来跳去，装炸药、安导火线，被她那灵巧熟练的动作所吸引。谁能相信就是她在半月以前还是个看见小孩放炮就吓得赶紧用手掩住耳朵的农村姑娘王凤茹。
    这些人还只是采矿厂上的“辅助劳动力”，说起那些主力军——人民公社社员、工人和机关干部干劲就更无法形容了。
    （三）
    “多挖矿石，保证炼铁炉有丰余的粮食。”无论在采矿场或是周围的小山村里，都使你有这样强烈的感觉。在这个矿区的周围，只有十来个一、二百户人家的小山村，突然增加一万多人，住宿就是个棘手的难题。可是民工们住的不是席棚，住的却是明光光宽亮的“工房”。涞水县民工负责人王所助告诉我：这一带农民只要是听说劈山挖铁矿，你缺什么他们自动就帮助解决。当民工刚到工地时没有地方住宿，各村农民自动地把一家人搬在一两间小房里，把最大最好的屋子腾出来让民工住。每天傍晚，在民工伙房院内挤满女社员，她们每人把节省下来的北瓜、西葫芦、茄子、豆角等蔬菜满满的一大筐送给民工。在农民公共食堂里很少吃到的菜，在这里却都堆的满满的。我问一位老大娘把菜都送来，你们吃什么。她却很干脆的说：地里活比挖矿轻，让小伙子们吃的饱饱的，好多挖矿石。
