Moscow, October 28th (By Our Correspondent) As the eighteen million members of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) and all the Soviet youth are joyously welcoming the 40th anniversary of the Komsomol with various new labor achievements, our reporter interviewed Aksonov and Rodionov, secretaries of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Soviet Komsomol. They made the following remarks to the reporter:

	For forty years, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet Komsomol has accumulated much revolutionary and labor experience. Forty years of experience have proven that the strength of the Komsomol lies primarily in the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party. The 20th Congress of the CPSU formulated a program for communist construction for the Soviet people. The 21st Congress of the CPSU, scheduled to be held in January next year, will unfold an even more beautiful construction picture for the Soviet people. The main task of the Soviet Komsomol at present is to actively organize and mobilize young people across the country to widely participate in communist construction. For forty years, the Soviet Komsomol members have firmly remembered Lenin's instructions: only through labor, only through joint labor with workers and peasants, can true communists be trained.

	The 13th Congress of the All-Union Komsomol, held in April this year, issued a call to young people across the country to actively participate in industrial and agricultural production. The youth enthusiastically responded to this call. On the eve of the 13th Congress, 700,000 young people signed up to participate in the construction of the Soviet East. After the 13th Congress, another 100,000 people rushed to new construction sites. Seven thousand five hundred young people participated in the electrification of the Siberian Railway. So far, electric trains have been running on more than 1,300 kilometers of electrified lines. In order to build the Soviet Union's third steel base, Komsomol members laid two new railways. A new railway directly connecting Siberia and Kuzbass, stretching 700 kilometers, will also be completed by young builders.

	The Komsomol has made great contributions to the development of the Soviet steel industry. Six of the seven newly built Komsomol blast furnaces this year have been completed ahead of schedule and have already produced iron. Two of the three Komsomol open-hearth furnaces have also been completed ahead of schedule. In the construction of the blast furnace in Zhdanov, two youth work teams of Komsomol members Sheinchenko and Morozov launched a competition in laying refractory bricks for the hot blast furnace. The former completed 400% of the work quota, and the latter reached 370%.

	In response to the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee to vigorously develop the chemical industry, Soviet youth have undertaken many shock construction projects for chemical plants, synthetic rubber plants, and gas pipelines. In all industrial sectors, Komsomol members are active promoters of new technologies and rationalization proposals. To greet the 40th anniversary of the Komsomol, young workers across the Soviet Union put forward 45,000 rationalization proposals, of which 60% have been implemented, saving the country about 20 million rubles annually. At present, in Moscow alone, there are 61,000 young workers who have completed their annual production plans as a gift to the 40th anniversary of the Komsomol.

	In the rapidly developing Soviet agriculture, the Komsomol also plays an outstanding role. Last year, the Komsomol was awarded the Order of Lenin for its contributions to land reclamation. In the past three years, more than one million urban youth have participated in the harvesting work in the wasteland. At the Vozvyshensky State Farm in West Kazakhstan Oblast, young harvester operators Vakhel and Pikhos worked day and night for fifteen days to harvest wheat in time. In the wasteland, many young people worked during the day and picked up wheat ears in the evening, producing more grain for the country. In Uzbekistan, many Komsomol members are high-yield cotton growers.

	Since the Soviet Communist Party put forward the call to catch up with and surpass the United States in the production of milk, meat and fats per capita, Soviet Komsomol members have enthusiastically responded to this call. Six hundred and fifty thousand young men and women have voluntarily gone to work in animal husbandry. In many places, graduating seniors from the tenth grade request to go to collective farms to work in animal husbandry as a whole class. In the Ryazan Oblast alone, there are more than 30,000 Komsomol members engaged in animal husbandry, responsible for caring for 150,000 pigs, 160,000 calves, and 900,000 poultry.

	This is how Soviet Komsomol members participate in communist construction with concrete actions.

	Aksonov and Rodionov also said that the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol attaches great importance to the communist ideological education of young people. The working cadres of the Soviet Komsomol strive to educate the younger generation with the revolutionary traditions and heroic fighting spirit of the Soviet working class, so that they are loyal to the cause of communism and loyal to proletarian internationalism.

    苏联共青团当了党的好助手  在共产主义建设中作出贡献
    苏联共青团中央两位书记对本报记者谈话
    本报莫斯科28日电　当苏联一千八百万列宁共产主义青年团团员和苏联全体青年正欢欣鼓舞以各种新的劳动成绩迎接共青团成立四十周年的时候，记者访问了苏联共青团中央委员会书记处书记阿克索诺夫和罗金诺夫，他们向记者发表了下列谈话：
    四十年来苏联共青团在苏联共产党的领导下，积累了许多革命和劳动的经验。四十年的经验证明，共青团的力量首先是在于苏联共产党的领导。苏共第二十次代表大会为苏联人民制定了共产主义建设的纲领，预定在明年1月召开的苏共第二十一次党代表大会，将给苏联人民展开一幅更美丽的建设图景。苏联共青团目前的主要任务，就是积极地组织和动员全国青年广泛地参加共产主义建设。四十年来，苏联共青团员牢牢地记着列宁的嘱咐：只有在劳动中，只有在与工人农民的共同劳动中才能锻炼出真正的共产主义者。
    今年4月召开的全苏共青团第十三次代表大会，向全国青年发出了积极参加工农业生产的号召。青年们热烈地响应了这项号召，在十三次代表大会前夕，有七十万青年报名参加了苏联东部的建设，十三次代表大会以后又有十万人奔赴新的建设工地。七千五百个青年参加了西伯利亚大铁路的电气化工作。到目前为止，电气火车已经奔驰在一千三百多公里的电气化路线上。为了建设苏联第三个钢铁基地，共青团员们敷设了两条新铁路，直连接西伯利亚和库兹巴斯长达七百公里的一条新铁路也将在青年建设者手中建成。
    共青团在发展苏联钢铁工业中间作了很大的贡献。今年新建的七座共青团高炉有六座已经提前完成，并已出铁。三个共青团平炉也有两座提前建成。在日丹诺夫的高炉建设中，共青团员谢因琴柯和马罗佐夫的两个青年工作队，在砌热风炉的耐火砖的工作中展开了竞赛，前者完成工作定额400％，后者达到370％。
    为了响应苏共中央大力发展化学工业的决议，苏联青年承担了许多项化学工厂、人造橡胶厂和煤气管的突击建设工作。在所有的工业部门中，共青团员都是推动新技术和合理化建议的积极分子。为了迎接共青团四十周年，苏联全国青年工人提出了四万五千条合理化建议，其中有60％已付诸实现，每年可为国家节省二千万卢布左右。目前，仅只莫斯科一地就有六万一千名青年工人以完成了全年生产计划作为对共青团四十周年的献礼。
    在飞跃发展的苏联农业方面，共青团也起着卓越的作用，去年共青团曾因在开荒中的功绩得到了列宁勋章。三年来已有一百多万城市青年到荒地参加了收割工作。在西哈萨克斯坦州沃兹维申国营农场，青年收割机手瓦赫?尔和彼霍斯，为了及时收割小麦，有十五昼夜日夜工作不离机器。在荒地上许多青年白天工作，晚间拾麦穗，为国家多打粮食。在乌兹别克斯坦，许多共青团员都是棉花的高产能手。
    自从苏联共产党提出了按人口平均计算要在牛奶、肉类和油脂生产上赶上并超过美国的号召以后，苏联共青团员踊跃地响应了这项号召。有六十五万男女青年自动到畜牧业方面工作。许多地方十年级毕业生整班整班地要求到农庄去作畜牧工作。仅只在梁赞州从事畜牧工作的共青团员就有三万多人，他们负责护养十五万头猪、十六万头小牛和九十万只家禽。
    苏联共青团员就是这样用具体行动来参加共产主义建设的。
    阿克索诺夫和罗金诺夫还说，苏联共青团中央极为重视对青年的共产主义思想教育，苏联共青团工作干部力求用苏联工人阶级的革命传统和英勇斗争精神教育青年一代，使他们忠实于共产主义事业，忠实于无产阶级国际主义。
