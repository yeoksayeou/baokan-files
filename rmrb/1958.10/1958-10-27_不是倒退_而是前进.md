    Not Regression, But Progress
    He Peixing
    On October 18th, the seventh edition of the People's Daily published an article by eight graduate students from the Department of Economics at Renmin University of China, "The Change from Supply System to Wage System is a Regression." I feel that some of the arguments are worth discussing.
    I disagree with the statement that changing from the supply system to the wage system after liberation was a regression. I believe that after the national liberation, through several years of recovery and construction, social production has experienced tremendous growth, and there is a material foundation for improving living standards. The supply system is no longer suitable for the economic situation at that time. Therefore, changing the supply system to the wage system is an objective and inevitable trend. The change from the supply system to the wage system is a decision made by the Party based on objective possibilities and the necessity of improving the lives of veteran comrades, and it conforms to objective laws. The result is that it has both developed production and improved the living standards of veteran comrades. It is not a step backwards, but a step forwards.
    I also disagree with the view that the supply system and the wage system should coexist. I don't think it is fair to demand that those veteran comrades always maintain the minimum living standard of the supply system in socialist construction (if it is their own request, it is correct). Because revolution is a matter for the entire class, it is a common matter for the 650 million people in our country. We cannot and should not demand that some people work hard, while others can choose not to. Indeed, when the wage system was implemented after liberation, there was a considerable period when the supply system and the wage system coexisted, but that was only temporarily maintained in the few years shortly after liberation in order to develop production. The past supply system was an expedient measure and by no means a long-term solution. As for maintaining the supply system and continuously expanding the scope of the supply system to gradually replace the wage system, it was impossible from the perspective of people's ideological awareness at that time. If we had done it that way at that time, it can be asserted that the level of production development would not have reached the height it is today. Only today, due to the general improvement of people's communist consciousness, can the semi-supply system or the supply system be generally implemented.

    不是倒退  而是前进
    何培煋
    10月18日人民日报第七版发表了一篇中国人民大学经济系王茂湘等八位研究生的“供给制改工资制是一种倒退”的文章，我感到有些论点值得商榷。
    我不同意认为解放后把供给制改为工资制是一种倒退的说法，我认为全国解放后，经过了几年的恢复和建设，社会生产有了巨大的增长，具备了改善生活的物质基础，供给制已经与当时的经济情况不相适应。因此改供给制为工资制是一种客观的必然趋势。供给制改为工资制这是党根据客观可能性和提高老同志的生活的必要性而作出的符合客观规律的决定。结果是既发展了生产，又提高了老同志的生活水平。不是倒退了一步，而是前进了一步。
    我也不同意供给制和工资制应该并存的看法。我觉得不应该要求那些老同志在社会主义建设中始终保持着供给制的最低的生活水平（如果是自己要求自己的话，是正确的），这是不公正的。因为革命是整个阶级的事情，是我国六亿五千万人民大众的共同事情，不能也不应该要求某一部分人去苦干，而另一部分人则可以不苦干。的确，在解放后实行工资制的时候，也有一个相当时期供给制和工资制并存过，但那仅是在解放不久的几年内为了发展生产而暂时维持。过去的供给制度，是一种权宜的措施，决非久远之计。至于保持供给制并不断扩大供给制范围，来逐步代替工资制，从当时人们的思想觉悟水平来看，是没有可能的。如果当时按照这个办法去做，可以断言，生产发展水平不会达到现在的高度。只有到了今天，由于人们的共产主义觉悟普遍有了提高，才能普遍实行半供给制或供给制。
