Using the Mass Line Approach: Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Conquer Tumors and Benefit Humanity

    This newspaper reports that, after overcoming the inferiority complex of blindly trusting foreigners in the rectification movement, researchers at all levels of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences have begun to establish the ambitious goal of "conquering tumors in five years."

    To coordinate actions in this battle concerning the lives and health of millions of people, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Committee organized a comprehensive tumor research committee in June of this year, including relevant units. The committee is divided into four comprehensive research groups: prevention, basic research, experimental treatment, and clinical research. These four research groups have selected cancers with high incidence rates and significant threats to humanity, such as cervical cancer, breast cancer, rectal cancer, penile cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, and oral cancer, as the primary targets to be conquered within two years. Over the past few months, they have achieved initial results. Through these results, people can establish confidence that fundamentally eliminating the threat of malignant tumors to humanity is not far off.

    The Youth Anti-Tumor Shock Brigade, with Communist Youth League members as the backbone, has made detailed statistics and analyses of the 150,000 cases of living tissue pathology examination materials and more than 2,000 cases of cervical cancer at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital since its opening. This not only provides valuable data for conquering tumors but also powerfully negates some of the Western scholars' dubious arguments about the causes of tumors.

    Conducting early treatment through tumor prevention surveys and carrying out active and proactive prevention is an extremely important issue. To prevent and treat malignant cervical tumors in women, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, organized its forces and, in cooperation with street cadres, discovered 32 cases of cervical cancer, 53 suspected cases awaiting further examination, and cervical erosion accounted for as much as 22.8% of the total number of women surveyed. Cervical erosion lesions are often an inducement for cervical cancer. Based on the results of the survey, in addition to conducting publicity among the broad masses, the hospital conducted cancer prevention surveys on 3,700 women over the age of 30. Through the survey, new explorations and research are underway on methods of tumor immunity and early tumor diagnosis, and significant progress has been made. The thorough solution of immunity and early diagnosis will provide very favorable weapons for conquering malignant tumors.

    In terms of treatment, integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine methods have been adopted. From the current situation, it can be affirmed that this method is a positive and promising path. In the past, many people, due to their blind faith in experts from capitalist countries, believed that while using one type of drug and method, another method and drug could not be used simultaneously, supposedly to "facilitate observation of research results." After breaking free from superstition and serious conservatism, the Tumor Hospital changed this single, one-sided treatment method and adopted a comprehensive treatment method. A patient with multiple fibrosarcoma lung cancer metastasis and another patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma had both been sentenced to death by certain "authorities" multiple times; now, under their active treatment, they have greatly improved, and the former has returned to work.

    Excavating anti-cancer therapies and drugs from the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine is currently a universally valued priority. Using the Chinese medicine Shennong Pill to treat lung tumors, Guanguanlang powder and acupuncture to treat esophageal cancer, and purple gromwell root to treat choriocarcinoma, etc., have all achieved significant results. In addition, several drugs with curative effects on tumors have been discovered in a large number of Chinese medicine screenings. The newly discovered antibiotic No. 4936, which has curative effects on tumors, is undergoing further research. Acupuncture has achieved very good results in treating various reactions after radiation therapy. It not only relieves patients' pain but also creates extremely favorable conditions for radiation therapy for tumors. (Xiong Shiqi)

### 用群众路线方法　中西医综合治疗  降伏肿瘤　造福人类

    用群众路线方法　中西医综合治疗
    降伏肿瘤　造福人类
    本报讯　中国医学科学院各级研究人员，在整风运动中砍掉了迷信洋人的自卑思想以后，开始树立起“五年制服肿瘤”的雄心。
    为了在这场关系着千百万人生命健康的战斗中协同动作，中国医学科学院委员会，于今年6月组织了一个包括有关单位的肿瘤综合研究委员会。委员会下分预防、基础、实验治疗、临床等四个综合研究小组。这四个研究小组，分别选择子宫颈癌、乳腺癌、直肠癌、阴茎癌、食道癌、肺癌、口腔癌等发病率较高，对人类威胁较大的癌症，作为在两年内首先予以制服的对象。几个月来，他们已经取得了初步战果。通过这些战果，人们可以确立这样的信心：从根本上解除恶性肿瘤对人类的威胁，已经为期不远了。
    以共青团员为骨干组成的青年抗瘤突击队，把协和医院开院来的十五万例活体病理检查材料，和两千多例子宫颈癌病例，分别作出了详细的统计和分析。这不仅为制服肿瘤提供了许多可贵的资料，而且有力地否定了西方学者的一些关于肿瘤发病原因的似是而非的论断。
    通过防瘤普查展开早期治疗，进行积极主动的预防，是一个极为重要的问题。为了防治妇女的子宫颈恶性肿瘤，中国医学科学院附属北京协和医院妇产科组织力量，在“七一”以后的三周中，在北京市街道上，和街道干部合作，通过发动群众的办法，发现有子宫癌症三十二人，可疑待继续检查的五十三人，患子宫颈靡烂的竟占普查妇女总数的22.8％。子宫颈靡烂的病变常常是发生子宫颈癌的诱因。根据普查的结果，该院除对广大群众进行宣传以外，并对三千七百名三十岁以上的妇女进行了防癌普查。通过普查正着手对肿瘤免疫、肿瘤早期诊断的方法进行新的探索和研究，且均已取得不少明显的进展。免疫和早期诊断的彻底解决，将给制服恶性肿瘤，提供非常有利的武器。
    在治疗方面，采取了中西医综合治疗的方法。从目前情况看，已经可以肯定，这一方法是一条积极的、大有希望的途径。过去，不少人员由于迷信资本主义国家的专家，认为：在用这种药物和方法的同时，就不能同时用另一种方法和药物，据说这是为了“便于观察研究结果”。肿瘤医院在破除了迷信和严重的保守思想之后，改变了这种单一的、片面的治疗方法，采取了综合治疗方法。一个多发性纤维肉瘤肺癌转移患者和另一例鼻咽癌患者，都曾多次被某些“权威”宣布死刑；现在，在他们积极的治疗下，都大见好转，前者已恢复工作。
    从祖国医学宝藏中，发掘抗癌的疗法和药物，是目前被普遍重视的首要问题。用中药神农丸治疗肺瘤，官贯郎散和针灸治疗食道癌，紫草根治疗绒毛膜上皮癌等，都已取得显著效果。此外，在大量的中药筛选中，已经发现了数种对肿瘤有疗效的药物。新发现的对肿瘤有疗效的4936号抗菌素，正在进一步研究中。用针灸治疗放射治疗后的各种反应，已经取得很好效果，它不仅为患者解除了痛苦，而且也为放射治疗肿瘤创造了一个极为有利的条件。　　　（熊世琦）
