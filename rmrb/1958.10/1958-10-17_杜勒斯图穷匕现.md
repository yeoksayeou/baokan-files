Dulles's Mask Falls Off
By our commentator

On the 14th, Dulles said at a press conference that he "could not inform the Communists in advance of our bargaining position through this press conference." However, under repeated questioning from reporters, no matter how evasive Dulles was, he still let the cat out of the bag.

Half a month ago, Dulles, at a press conference, proposed a "deal" with China. That "deal" was to exchange a reduction of the Jinmen and Matsu Chiang troops for perpetual occupation of Taiwan and Penghu. But how could the Chinese people use their own territory to make a "deal" with Dulles! Of course, this "deal" could not be made. The firm attitude of the Chinese people made Dulles admit this time that "there is nothing to bargain with the Communists in this regard." However, Dulles's remarks revealed that the "deal" was originally a trick. According to Dulles, the so-called reduction of the Chiang troops in Jinmen and Matsu was merely "a question of how to effectively and most powerfully use the existing troops." Stationing troops in Taiwan "will have greater flexibility and a wider range of action, and they can return to Jinmen when needed." This is what Dulles said himself, not the propaganda of us Communists. Dulles really gave a vivid lesson to the people of the world, to all well-meaning people. The American "ceasefire" is just a military deployment under the guise of a political deal.

Dulles thought he had learned a lesson from his mistakes and became "smarter" this time. Regarding "what kind of bargaining attitude the United States will take, what we (referring to the United States) are willing to do, and what we are unwilling to do," in order to "prevent the Communists from understanding" and "avoid saying anything that would cause Taiwan to misinterpret," he was initially tight-lipped at the press conference. However, a capitalist's mind for doing business cannot be changed. While speaking, he brought up his "ceasefire" business again: "If there can be any reliable ceasefire in that area, the situation will automatically undergo considerable changes, almost like inexorable logic." Dulles may have thought that this would throw out a bait to give those willing to take the bait high hopes. However, Dulles neglected that too much talk leads to mistakes, and his entire speech, "like inexorable logic," naturally peeled off his own mask.

Leaving aside everything that only has superficial value, people can easily see from Dulles's remarks what the United States is unwilling to do and what it is willing to do.

What Dulles is unwilling to do is "Americans go home." In the proclamation of our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai, it is indeed emphatically stated: "The Americans always have to leave, it is impossible not to leave." "Why did a country in the Eastern Pacific run to the Western Pacific?" "The Americans who stay in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait must get out. They have no reason to stay here, it is impossible not to leave." Dulles could not give any reason to answer such a question within the scope of common sense. However, he said that the Chinese people hope to "drive the American troops out of the Western Pacific," and "I think we must also think this way, and not be shortsighted so that we ignore the big things that are at risk in the current situation." The United States has invaded China's territory of Taiwan, and the Chinese people, even the people of the whole world, want the Americans to get out. Isn't this the fundamental way to eliminate the current war crisis and ease international tensions? How can it be called "dangerous big things"? The United States is unwilling to do such good things that are beneficial to itself and turn passivity into initiative, so what is Dulles willing to do?

What Dulles is willing to do is for the United States to continue to be "loyal" to the "Common Security Treaty" concluded between the United States and Chiang, and Dulles further said, "It believes that this treaty is not just an arrangement between governments," but "an arrangement that conforms to the wishes of all Chinese who cherish freedom." He also said more blatantly: "We do not approve of handing over these islands (Jinmen and Matsu) to the Chinese Communists, which would hand over 45,000 soldiers and civilians (on Jinmen Island alone), and they are unwilling to be handed over. We don't do things that abandon people, even if the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) agrees." The mask falls off, and the ugly face of the imperialist aggressor is completely exposed.

Here, Dulles spoke for the first time about the bottom line of the American robbers. Dulles actually regards himself as the "protector" of the Chinese people! According to Dulles's logic, the reason why the Americans are loyal to the "Common Security Treaty" is not only "an arrangement between governments," but also "an arrangement that conforms to the wishes of all Chinese who cherish freedom"; in other words, even if the Taiwan authorities one day abolish the US-Chiang treaty, the United States will still "conform to the wishes of the Chinese who cherish freedom" and make arrangements on its own according to the "Common Security Treaty"; for Jinmen and Matsu, even if the Taiwan authorities agree to "hand over," the United States will not agree, because that will "hand over 45,000 soldiers and civilians." What a wicked wolf! It seems that the Chinese people cannot survive without the "protection" of people like Dulles! Isn't Dulles once again nakedly confessing the die-hard aggressive policy of US imperialism to antagonize the Chinese people and enslave the Chinese people? From here, isn't it easy for people to discover that all the deals made by people like Dulles, no matter how they change, are nothing more than using this and that method to occupy Taiwan, occupy Jinmen and Matsu, and then "climb up to the mainland when needed" to destroy the whole of China! This is what the Americans plan to do!

We should thank Dulles once again, this negative teacher. With his help in doing political work, it will surely enable the soldiers and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu to awaken early, unite with the 650 million people of the whole country under the banner of patriotism, recover Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu as a whole, and complete the sacred task of national reunification.

    杜勒斯图穷匕现
    本报评论员
    14日，杜勒斯在记者招待会上说，他“不能够通过这个记者招待会事先使共产党人了解我们的讨价还价地位”，可是，在记者的一再追问下，不管杜勒斯怎么躲躲闪闪，还是漏了底。
    半个月以前，杜勒斯在一次记者招待会上，曾经提出要同中国做一笔“买卖”。那次“买卖”，就是以减少金马蒋军来换取永霸台澎。可是中国人民怎么能够用自己的领土来同杜勒斯做“买卖”呢！这笔“买卖”当然做不成。中国人民坚决的态度，使杜勒斯这一次也不能不承认，“在这一方面没有什么可以同共产党讨价还价的”。但是，杜勒斯的谈话却揭开了那笔“买卖”原来是个骗局。照杜勒斯的说法，所谓减少金门马祖的蒋军，不过是“如何能够有效地和最有力地使用现有军队的问题”，把军队驻扎在台湾，“将有更大的灵活性，而且具有更加广泛行动范围，而且一旦需要的时候他们可以回到金门去。”这是杜勒斯亲自说的话，不是我们共产党人的宣传。杜勒斯真的给全世界人民，一切好心肠的人上了生动的一课。美国的“停火”，不过是政治买卖掩盖下的一个军事部署。
    杜勒斯自以为吃一堑长一智，这次变得“更聪明”些了。对于美国“究竟还将采取什么样的讨价还价态度，我们（指美国）愿意做什么，以及我们不愿意做什么”，为了“不使共产党人了解”，以及“不要说什么会使台湾作出错误解释的话”，他在记者招待会上开始是讳莫如深的。可是，资本家做买卖的脑袋是变不了的。他说着说着，又谈起他的“停火”生意经来了：“如果在那个地区能够有任何可靠的停火一类的东西，这一局势就会自动地发生相当可观的变化，差不多就像铁面无情的逻辑一样。”杜勒斯也许以为，这样就投出了香饵，使愿上钩者有厚望焉。但是，杜勒斯却疏忽了，言多必失，他的整个谈话也“像铁面无情的逻辑一样”，自然而然地剥下了他自己的画皮。
    抛开一切只具有表面价值的东西，人们不难从杜勒斯的谈话里看到，杜勒斯已经明白地说出了美国所不愿意做的是什么，所愿意做的又是什么。
    杜勒斯所不愿意做的，就是“美国人回家去”。在我国国防部部长彭德怀的文告里，确实大书特书着：“美国人总是要走的，不走是不行的。”“一个东太平洋国家，为什么跑到西太平洋来了呢？”“呆在台湾和台湾海峡地区的美国人必须滚回去。他们赖在这里是没有理由的，不走是不行的”。杜勒斯说不出任何理由来回答这样属于常识范围以内的问题。可是他却说，中国人民希望把美国部队“赶出西太平洋”，“我以为我们也必须这样想，而不要目光短浅，以致我们忽视了在目前局势中处于危险的大事”。美国侵占了中国的领土台湾，中国人民以至全世界人民都要美国人滚回去，这不是消除目前战争危机、缓和国际紧张局势的根本之道吗？又怎么能叫做“危险的大事”呢？美国对于这样有利于己、变被动为主动的好事不愿做，那么，杜勒斯还能愿意做什么呢？
    杜勒斯愿意做的，就是美国继续“忠于”美蒋缔结的“共同安全条约”，杜勒斯并且进一步说，“它相信，这个条约不仅仅是一项政府之间的安排”，而且是“顺应所有珍视自由的中国人的愿望的安排”。他还更露骨地说：“我们不赞成把这些岛屿（金门马祖）交给中国共产党人，这倒底要交出四万五千名军民（仅金门一岛），而他们是不愿意被交出去的。我们不做抛弃人民的事，即使中华民国（指蒋介石集团）同意。”图穷匕现，帝国主义者的侵略面目狰狞毕露了。
    在这里，杜勒斯第一次说出了美国强盗的底牌。杜勒斯竟以中国人民的“保护者”自居了！按照杜勒斯的逻辑，美国人之所以忠于“共同安全条约”，不仅是“政府之间的安排”，而且是“顺应所有珍视自由的中国人的愿望的安排”；换句话说，即使台湾当局有朝一日，废除了美蒋条约，美国也还将“顺应珍视自由的中国人的愿望”，根据“共同安全条约”而自作安排；对于金门马祖，即使台湾当局同意“交出”，美国也不同意，因为那将“交出四万五千名军民”。好一个狼外婆！似乎中国人民离了杜勒斯之流的“保护”就活不成了！杜勒斯难道不是再一次赤裸裸地供出了美帝国主义敌视中国人民、奴役中国人民的死硬的侵略政策吗？从这里，人们难道不是很容易去发现杜勒斯之流所做的一切买卖，万变不离其宗，无非是用这样那样的方法，侵占台湾，侵占金马，进而“在一旦需要的时候”，爬上大陆来，灭亡全中国！这就是美国人的打算！
    我们应当再一次感谢杜勒斯这一位反面教员。有了他帮助我们做政治工作，必将使台澎金马的军民同胞，早日觉悟过来，同全国六万万五千万人民一起，团结在爱国主义的旗帜下，把台、澎、金、马整个地收复回来，完成祖国统一的神圣任务。
