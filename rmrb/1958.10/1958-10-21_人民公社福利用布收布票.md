Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The Fifth Office of the State Council recently forwarded the Ministry of Commerce's report "Regarding the Supply of Cloth for Welfare Undertakings in People's Communes" and instructed the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to do a good job in the supply of cotton cloth based on the opinions in the report.

The report stated: Since the establishment of people's communes, the public use of cloth has increased significantly. Much of this is for making personal clothing and bedding for commune nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly (happiness homes), and youth shock brigades. In many cases, cloth was supplied with just a note, without collecting cloth coupons. We believe that for nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, youth shock brigades, etc., if the cloth is for personal use, cloth coupons should still be collected as for personal use and should not be supplied under the category of public use. The supply of cloth for industrial and public use should also be verified, and thrift and the use of substitutes should be promoted.

    人民公社福利用布收布票
    据新华社18日讯　国务院第五办公室最近转发了商业部“关于人民公社福利事业用布的供应问题”的报告，指示各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据报告中的意见，作好棉布供应工作。
    报告说：自人民公社成立后，公共用布增长很突出，其中不少是属于为公社托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、男女青年突击队做个人衣服、被盖之用，许多是不收布票只批个条子就供应的。我们认为：托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院、男女青年突击队等所需用布，若系个人用布性质，仍应按个人用布收布票，不能列入公共用布项内供应。对工业及公共用布，也应核实供应，并提倡节约和代用。
