Initiative Cannot Be Measured by Money
Liu Feng

Recently, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai have universally requested the abolition of the piece-rate wage system, which is a new style of the communist era. Because in our country, the working people no longer need to worry about food and clothing, and people have begun to get used to observing the basic rules of public life. Due to the Great Leap Forward in production, productivity has greatly increased, and we have been able to voluntarily work to the best of our ability. The principle of distribution according to work has already felt backward here. In today's rapidly advancing situation of the Great Leap Forward, the piece-rate wage and bonus system of more work, more pay, no longer plays a promotional role as it did in the old days. As one worker put it well, "Our initiative cannot be measured by money," which is absolutely true. May I ask, in the various historical periods of our country's revolution, was the spirit of self-sacrifice of revolutionaries for communism for any reward, or could it be measured by money?

To realize communism, there must be three conditions: a large increase in products; a surge in moral character; and the popularization and improvement of education. Now our products have increased several times, dozens of times, and even hundreds of times. Today, people's moral character is also undergoing significant changes. The combination of education and productive labor, as well as the policy of popularizing education, is being actively promoted. The people of the whole country are building socialism in greater, faster, better, and more economical ways, not just to work hard to get more money. The driving force for people's labor is not money, but the early realization of the beautiful communist ideal. What people care about is the cause of communism, not, as some theorists say, "people are always concerned about their material rewards." People who are preoccupied with their own petty gains and losses are greatly backward here.

Lenin said at the Eighth All-Russian Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "...So-called communism, strictly speaking, is to work for society without pay, without considering the differences of each individual, without the slightest old views, without conservatism, old habits, differences between various work departments, and differences in labor remuneration, and so on." The communist moral qualities that Lenin spoke of have become a reality that is beginning to sprout. However, in the minds of ordinary people, when they think of communism, they only think of "distribution according to needs," and they always consider the surge in moral qualities less. This is actually not even close to communist style.

Of course, even in this era full of admirable heroes, there are always dwarfs who are nauseating and laughable. A private staff member of a metal engraving model factory in Shanghai even said: "If you want me to improve the mold, I want night work pay and bonuses. If you don't agree to my conditions, my body can't take it." (See page 6 of the Liberation Daily, September 29) As soon as he opens his mouth, the stench of the bourgeoisie bursts out. May I ask, how far is this kind of thinking from the communist style of not counting rewards that has emerged in our worker ranks today! The closer we get to communist society, the more those whose mental outlook cannot adapt must transform themselves, or they will inevitably be abandoned by the times and will not be able to enter the gate of communist society.

The increase in material products will inevitably change people's mental outlook, and the communist style will inevitably rise accordingly. This is a matter of course, and things will fall into place when conditions are ripe. After the workers in Shanghai demanded the abolition of piece-rate wages and extra bonuses, it did not cause laziness as some people thought. On the contrary, it greatly promoted communism, and output also increased significantly. Class consciousness also greatly improved, and the feeling of being the masters of the country became more obvious and stronger. What other people consider to be incomprehensible is completely a normal phenomenon in the eyes of those of us who are in the situation. This normal phenomenon was scientifically predicted by the communist sages more than a hundred years and decades ago.

    积极性不能用金钱衡量
    刘丰
    最近上海广大职工普遍要求取消计件工资制，这是一种共产主义时代的新风格。因为在我们国度里，劳动人民早已不必为衣食而担心，人们已经开始习惯遵守公共生活的基本规则。由于生产大跃进，生产率已经大大提高，我们已能自愿地各尽所能地进行工作，按劳取酬的原则在我们这里已经感觉到落后了。在今天一日千里大跃进的形势下，多劳多酬的计件工资和奖金制度已经不是像旧日那样起促进的作用，一位工人说得好“我们的积极性不能用金钱来衡量”，这是千真万确的话。试问在我国革命的各个历史时期，革命者为共产主义自我牺牲的精神，难道是为了什么报酬或者可以用金钱能衡量得了吗？
    实现共产主义要有三个条件：产品的大量增加；道德品质的高涨；教育的普及提高。现在我们的产品几倍、十几倍、几十倍提高，今天人们的道德品质也在起着显著的变化，教育和生产劳动相结合，以及普及教育的政策正在积极推行。全国人民都在多快好省地建设社会主义，不是为了多拿钱才去努力工作。人们劳动的动力不是金钱，而是美妙的共产主义理想的早日实现。人们关心的是共产主义事业，而不是如某些理论家所说的“人们总是关心自己的物资报酬的”。斤斤计较自己鼻子尖上的一点点利禄的人，在我们这里是大大的落后了。
    列宁在俄共（布）第八次全国代表会议上说过：“……所谓共产主义，严格说来，就是无代价地为社会工作，不考虑每个人的差别，丝毫没有旧的观点，没有守旧心理，旧习气，各工作部门间的差别以及劳动报酬上的不同等等。”列宁所说的共产主义的道德品质，已经成为了开始萌芽的现实了。而在一般人的头脑里想到共产主义就只是片面的想到“各取所需”，对于道德品质的高涨总是考虑得少些。这实际上还谈不上共产主义风格的。
    自然，即使在这样到处是令人崇敬的英雄的时代，也总是还有令人发呕发笑的侏儒。上海的一家金属雕刻模型厂的一位私方人员还说：“你要我改进模子，我要夜工钱，还要奖金，不依我的条件，我身体吃不消。”（见9月29日解放日报六版）嘴一张，资产阶级的铜臭味就冲口而出。试问这种思想和今天在我们工人队伍中所产生的不计报酬的共产主义风格是相去多么远啊！距离共产主义社会越近，精神面貌不能相适应的人，如不改造自己，就必然被时代所抛弃，进不了共产主义社会的大门。
    物质产品的增加，必然改变人们的精神面貌，共产主义风格也必然随之高涨，这是顺理成章水到成渠的事。上海工人要求取消计件工资和超额奖金之后，并没有如某些所想的那样造成懒惰的现象，恰恰相反，大大发扬了共产主义，产量也有了显著的增长，阶级觉悟也跟着大大提高，主人翁的感觉也更明显、更强烈了。在别的人们认为是不可理解的事，在我们身临其境的人看来则完全是一种正常的现像，而这种正常的现象，早在一百多年和几十年之前共产主义的先哲们就科学地预见到了。
