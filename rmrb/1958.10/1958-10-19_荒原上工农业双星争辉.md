    The Mishan Reclamation Area, thanks to the implementation of the construction policy of "reclaiming wasteland, producing, building, accumulating, and expanding simultaneously," is making progress in wasteland reclamation, production, and construction at the same time. It is estimated that 4.5 million mu of wasteland will be reclaimed throughout the year, and 2.6 million mu will be sown, both increasing by 150% compared to 1957. In order to put the reclaimed wasteland into production as soon as possible, soybeans were planted as much as possible on the spring wasteland reclaimed that year, or buckwheat was planted urgently.
    After the great rectification movement, the demobilized soldiers and the broad masses of workers in the reclamation area were even more motivated, everyone striving to be the best, and agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In 1957, the entire reclamation area produced more than 80 million jin of grain. In 1958, it leaped to 200 million jin, an increase of 150% compared to 1957. In 1957, 43 million jin of soybeans were produced here. This year, it leapt to 70 million jin, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1957.
    Heilongjiang is the northernmost region for rice production in China. Despite the cold climate and short frost-free period, some farms here still achieved large-scale high yields. For example, 870 mu of rice at the Mishan Farm had an average yield of 1,733 jin per mu this year, of which 150 mu had an average yield of more than 1,867 jin per mu. The 360 mu of wheat at this farm also had an average yield of 533 jin per mu.
    In order to promote another overall leap forward in agricultural production in 1959 and release high-yield "satellites" on a large scale, the entire reclamation area is now launching a high tide of deep plowing, manure accumulation, and water conservancy construction. According to the plan for the entire area, 45,000 people will be organized this winter and next spring to carry out large-scale water conservancy projects, with a total earthwork volume of more than 34 million cubic meters, including more than 60 large, medium, and small reservoirs. The irrigation and drainage area of these projects will reach 5.1 million mu. The water management policy of the Mishan Reclamation Area is "emphasizing storage, combined with drainage and irrigation." After these mountain and plain reservoirs are completed, "stars in the sky" and "grape bunch" style water conservancy projects will also appear on the mountains and plains here.
    Animal husbandry in the reclamation area is also advancing alongside agricultural production. The number of pigs raised on various farms in the reclamation area is increasing. The total number of pigs raised on various farms is now 44,000, a threefold increase compared to 1957; 5,700 cattle and 8,900 horses are raised, both of which have also increased compared to last year. In order to solve the supply of non-staple foods in winter, fishing teams have been organized to carry out mass fishing activities. In the future, after the reservoirs here are completed, fish fry will be released in a planned manner to develop fisheries.
    The Wanda Mountains in the Mishan Reclamation Area have abundant forest resources. In order to support industrial construction and solve the problem of basic construction materials for farms, 1 million cubic meters of timber will be cut this year, striving for 2 million cubic meters, and five wood processing plants will be built.
    The demobilized soldiers and the broad masses of workers in the Mishan Reclamation Area, while vigorously reclaiming wasteland and developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, have also firmly grasped industrial and sideline production.
    At present, all farms, branch farms, and production teams in the reclamation area are actively responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee to double steel production, and are fighting to achieve the production of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. It is estimated that by the end of the year, 1,156 various small blast furnaces and native furnaces will be built, producing 16,760 tons of iron and 250 tons of steel. In order to ensure the completion of the steel production task, it is necessary to mine 95,500 tons of iron ore, refine 42,500 tons of coke, manufacture 3,000 tons of refractory bricks, and produce 250 blowers.
    Now, all farms have established steel production offices to be responsible for directing steelmaking and ironmaking. The 852 Farm has formed a steelmaking army of more than 500 people, engaged in mining, furnace construction, and ironmaking. The Mishan Farm has built 84 various small blast furnaces, producing 1,090 tons of iron. After the Yong'an Farm built 23 native blast furnaces and 100 native furnaces and put them into production, it can produce 1,500 tons of iron.
    The Mishan Reclamation Area has also launched the oil refining industry, using coal, oil shale, peat, pine needles, pine roots, and pine knots as raw materials for oil refining. A refinery with an annual output of 300 tons at the Yong'an Farm has been basically completed, and a refinery with an annual output of 3,000 tons at the Mudanjiang Farm is under construction.
    The reclamation area has also built various agricultural and sideline product processing plants, wood processing plants, fertilizer plants, etc., which are adapted to agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production. It is estimated that 236 new factories of various types will be built in 1958, which, together with the existing ones, will reach 274. A large sugar factory with a daily processing capacity of 1,000 tons of sugar beets has started construction in Hulin. After the factory is completed, it can produce more than 26,000 tons of white sugar annually. In order to comprehensively utilize sugar beets, the sugar factory is also equipped with alcohol waste molasses and rayon factories. In order to solve the power needed for industry, the reclamation area plans to build a number of hydroelectric and thermal power plants (stations) to form a power grid. A thermal power plant with a power generation capacity of 12,000 kilowatts has started construction. A hydroelectric power station with a power generation capacity of 400 kilowatts will be built at the Yunshan Reservoir.
    In order to solve the problem of transporting a large number of agricultural, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, industrial, and sideline products out of the reclamation area, as well as the transportation between farms, the Agricultural Reclamation Bureau has built the Mi-Hu Railway. While building the railway, 755 kilometers of highways have also been built. (Attached picture)

    荒原上工农业双星争辉
    密山垦区由于贯彻执行了“边开荒、边生产、边建设、边积累、边扩大”的建场方针，开荒、生产和建设同时并进，预计今年全年可开出荒地四百五十万亩，播种二百六十万亩，均比1957年翻一番半。为了使开出的荒地尽快地投入生产，当年开的春荒也尽一切可能种上了大豆，或抢种上荞麦。
    经过伟大的整风运动以后，垦区的转业官兵和广大职工，个个干劲更足，人人都争上游，农业生产获得空前大丰收。1957年全垦区生产粮食八千多万斤，1958年跃到两亿斤，比1957年翻一番半。1957年这里生产大豆四千三百万斤，今年跃进到七千万斤，比1957年也增加了二分之一以上。
    黑龙江是我国水稻生产最北的地区。在气候严寒、无霜期短的情况下，这里的一些农场仍获得大面积丰产。如密山农场八百七十亩水稻，今年平均亩产一千七百三十三斤，其中一百五十亩，平均亩产一千八百六十七斤以上。这个场的三百六十亩小麦，平均亩产量也达五百三十三斤。
    为了促使1959年的农业生产再来一个全面跃进，放出大面积的高产卫星，全垦区现在正掀起深耕、积肥和兴修水利的高潮。根据全区的计划，今冬明春要组织四万五千人大兴水利，工程量达三千四百多万土石方，包括大中小型水库六十多个，这些工程的排灌面积达五百一十万亩。密山垦区的治水方针是“以蓄为主，结合排灌”。这些山区和平原水库建成后，这里的山上和平原也将出现“满天星”“葡萄串”式的水利工程。
    垦区的畜牧业也和农业生产并肩前进。垦区各场饲养的猪越来越多了，现在各场养猪的总头数是四万四千头，比1957年翻三番；养牛五千七百头，养马八千九百匹，比去年也都有增长。为了解决冬季副食品的供应，已组织捕鱼队，开展群众性的捕鱼运动。将来这里的水库建成后，将有计划地放养鱼苗，发展渔业。
    密山垦区完达山的森林资源十分丰富，为了支援工业建设和解决农场基本建设用料，今年将伐木一百万立方公尺，争取伐木二百万立方公尺，并兴建木材加工厂五处。
    密山垦区的转业官兵和广大职工，在大力垦荒发展农牧生产的同时，还紧紧抓住了工业生产和副业生产。
    目前垦区各个农场、分场、生产队都积极响应党中央把钢产翻一番的伟大号召，为实现今年生产一千零七十万吨钢而战斗。预计到年底将建成各式小高炉和土炉一千一百五十六个，炼铁一万六千七百六十吨，炼钢二百五十吨。为了确保钢铁生产任务的完成，需要开采铁矿九万五千五百吨，炼焦四万二千五百吨，制造耐火砖三千吨和鼓风机二百五十台。
    现在各场都成立了钢铁生产办公室，负责指挥炼钢、炼铁。八五二农场组成了一支五百多人的钢铁大军，采矿、建炉和炼铁。密山农场已建起各式小高炉八十四座，产铁一千零九十吨。永安农场兴建二十三个土高炉和一百个土炉投入生产后，可产铁一千五百吨。
    密山垦区还举办了炼油工业，以煤、油母页岩、草炭和松叶、松根、松节为原料进行炼油。永安农场年产三百吨的炼油厂一处已基本建成，牡丹江农场一座年产三千吨的炼油厂正在筹建中。
    垦区还建设了与农业、牧业、林业生产相适应的各种农副产品加工厂、木材加工厂、化肥厂等。1958年预计新建各种工厂二百三十六座，连同原有的，将达到二百七十四座。一个日处理甜菜一千吨的大型糖厂已在虎林动工兴建。这个厂建成后，可年产白糖两万六千多吨。为了综合利用甜菜，糖厂还附设了酒精废蜜、人造纤维等工厂。为了解决工业需用的动力，垦区内计划兴建若干水力和火力发电厂（站），构成一个电力网。一个发电能力一万二千瓩的火力发电厂已动工兴建。云山水库将建立发电能力四百瓩的水力发电站一处。
    为了解决垦区内大量农、林、渔、牧和工、副业产品的外运以及场间的交通运输问题，农垦局已修建了密——虎铁路。在修建铁路的同时，还修了七百五十五公里的公路。（附图片）
