Xinhua News Agency, October 12th – The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued a communique on early rice production in 1958. The full text is as follows:

This year, early rice achieved a bumper harvest. The national total of over 146 million mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 596 jin per mu, with a total output of over 87 billion jin of rice. The yield per unit area increased by 269 jin, or 82%, compared to the 327 jin in 1957. The total output increased by over 48 billion jin, or 126%, compared to the 38.7 billion jin in 1957. The increase in early rice production this year is more than 12 billion jin greater than the total annual increase in rice production during the First Five-Year Plan period.

This year, there were over 15 million mu of early rice across the country with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, accounting for more than 10% of the early rice planting area. Among them, about 140,000 mu yielded between 3,000 jin and 5,000 jin, and about 25,000 mu yielded between 5,000 jin and 10,000 jin. There were four provinces and cities with yields exceeding 1,000 jin. Jiangsu Province had 2.64 million mu, with an average yield of 1,040 jin per mu. Hubei Province had over 4.62 million mu, with an average yield of 1,033 jin per mu. Shanghai City had 49,400 mu, with an average yield of 1,019 jin per mu. Anhui Province had over 6.129 million mu, with an average yield of 1,005 jin per mu. There were 115 counties (cities) with early rice yields exceeding 1,000 jin per mu, including 30 in Hubei Province, 21 in Jiangsu Province, 20 in Anhui Province, 14 in Zhejiang Province, 12 in Sichuan Province, 11 in Yunnan Province, 4 in Hunan Province, 2 in Guizhou Province, and 1 in Guangxi Province. The highest yield per mu was in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, where over 302,000 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 1,855 jin per mu. The second highest was in Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province, where 34,700 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 1,500 jin per mu. In Tongcheng County, Anhui Province, 453,000 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 1,485 jin per mu. In Xingfu Township, Langxi County, Anhui Province, 16,450 mu of early rice achieved an average yield of 3,008 jin per mu, meaning that the average person in the township received 5,104 jin of grain from just one season of early rice.

This year, there were over 300 mu of high-yield early rice fields with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per mu. A 1.01 mu experimental plot in the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Pingqing Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, yielded 16,260 jin per mu. A 1.042 mu experimental plot in the Gaofeng Cooperative, Zongyang County, Anhui Province, yielded an average of 16,227 jin per mu. A 1.45 mu experimental plot in the Aoxian Cooperative, Liling County, Hunan Province, yielded an average of 15,665 jin per mu. A 1.016 mu plot of early rice in the Jianguo First Agricultural Cooperative, Maxihe Township, Macheng County, Hubei Province, using the method of merging seedlings, achieved an average yield of 36,956 jin of dried rice per mu.

This year's bumper harvest of early rice is the result of implementing the socialist general line; it is the result of boldly innovating technology and fighting against natural disasters through the mass rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle; it is the result of the broad masses of cadres and people daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and promoting the new communist style.

This year's early rice harvest, like other crops, was not due to favorable weather. Generally, varying degrees of drought occurred in the early rice areas of the south this year. Yunnan Province experienced a drought unseen in 60 years. The Luzhou area of Sichuan Province experienced 180 days of drought. Many areas carried out drought-resistant sowing and transplanting from the beginning of spring. After transplanting, various regions criticized the idea of "relying on the heavens for rain" and put forward the slogan of "Man will conquer nature" and "Ensure a bumper harvest even without rain." They concentrated labor, kept the machines running without rest, dammed rivers, opened springs to divert water, and worked hard day and night in every possible way, finally overcoming the drought. In June and July, rice blast, rice planthoppers, and leafhoppers occurred widely, and various regions took timely measures to eliminate pests and diseases by combining indigenous and foreign methods.

This year, various regions implemented agricultural production increase measures better than in any previous year. The irrigated area was expanded last winter and this spring, and irrigation equipment was improved. The amount of accumulated fertilizer increased several times, or even dozens of times, compared to last year. In terms of cultivation, the main focus was on the techniques of deep plowing, close planting, early sowing, early transplanting, and a series of field management practices. The plowing depth increased by one to two inches compared to the past, the transplanting density increased by one to two wan seedlings, and the number of seedlings per cluster was appropriately increased, breaking the past theory of relying on tillering for yield in small-plant close planting. A variety of transplanting forms and close planting methods were created, and the laws of close planting for increased production were found. Under the conditions of deep plowing, abundant fertilizer, and careful land preparation, uniform direct seeding is also a highly dense planting method and can be used as long as there are no crops in the field during the appropriate seeding period. Some units have adopted the method of merging seedlings in some rice fields to implement highly dense planting. This method can move seedlings to water in the event of severe drought, and it can also free up land to grow another season. As long as the transplanting time is appropriate, the transplanting density is appropriate, and cultivation and management are strengthened, it can increase production. It also has scientific value for some inexperienced units to conduct experiments in this regard. However, whether it is necessary to universally promote the method of merging seedlings after the heading of late-maturing rice, under normal natural conditions, needs further research.

This year's early rice sowing and transplanting were generally one solar term earlier than last year. Due to the early sowing period, many places adopted methods such as warm-bed seedling raising, cold-bed seedling raising, oil-paper seedling raising, and nylon seedling raising. They universally adopted moist seedling fields, seized the sunny weather for sowing in a timely manner, and prevented wind and frost, to achieve the purpose of preventing seedling rot and cultivating strong seedlings. During the rice growing period, field management work centered on early sowing and close planting was carried out, and the methods of early topdressing, early irrigation, early weeding, and multiple applications of fertilizer and irrigation were adopted to fully exert the production increase effect of early sowing and close planting.

Next year, the area of early rice should be expanded compared to this year, and the yield per unit area should be greatly increased. All regions should carefully summarize this year's experience in achieving high yields of early rice, make plans for early rice production next year, and strive for a greater leap forward next year.

Xinhua News Agency, October 12th - The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued a communique on spring wheat production in 1958. The full text is as follows:

Following the bumper harvest of winter wheat, spring wheat also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The planting area was 43.19 million mu. The yield per unit area was 233 jin, an increase of 106 jin compared to 1957, an increase of 83%. The total output was more than 10 billion jin, an increase of more than 3.9 billion jin compared to 1957, an increase of 63%, and more than 1 billion jin higher than the estimated 9 billion jin in this year's summer harvest grain crop production communique. Other wheat types are not included.

According to preliminary statistics, this year's area with spring wheat yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu is more than 1.24 million mu. Among them, 11,360 mu yielded 2,000 jin to 3,000 jin per mu, 41 mu yielded 3,000 jin to 4,000 jin per mu, and 38 mu yielded 4,000 jin to more than 5,000 jin per mu. The counties with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu are Hezheng County and Dunhuang County in Gansu Province. The counties and cities with yields of 700 jin to 900 jin per mu are Zhangye, Wuwei, Gaotai, Linxia County, Linxia City in Gansu Province, and Wuzhong City in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The counties and cities with yields of 500 jin to 700 jin per mu are Yumen, Kangle, Gulang, Yongchang, Shandan, Minle, Guanghe, Weiyuan, Lintan County, Lanzhou, Yumen City in Gansu Province, Zhongwei, Zhongning, Ningshuo, Yongning County, Yinchuan City in Ningxia region, Guide County in Qinghai Province, and Urumqi in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. There are 30 counties and cities with yields of 400 jin to 500 jin, including 12 in Gansu Province, 7 in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 6 in Ningxia region, and 5 in Qinghai Province.

The 1.059 mu experimental plot of the Saishike Farm in Qinghai Province had an average yield of 8,585 jin per mu. The 1.22 mu experimental plot of the 17th production team of the Yiquan Agricultural Cooperative in Tumen Township, Gulang County, Gansu Province, had an average yield of 6,029.5 jin per mu. The 1.08 mu experimental plot of the first production team of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongwei County, Ningxia region, had an average yield of 5,801 jin per mu.

The main reasons for the bumper harvest of spring wheat in various regions this year are the thorough implementation of the general line of building socialism, the continuous overcoming of right-leaning conservative thinking, debating everything, planting red flags and pulling out white flags, clearing all obstacles on the road to the leap forward, holding on-site meetings, observing and comparing, promoting the advanced, overcoming the backward, fully mobilizing the masses, implementing production increase measures, and overcoming natural disasters.

On the basis of vigorously developing water conservancy and fertilizer last winter and this spring, various regions have universally promoted basic measures such as water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density, especially focusing on the characteristics of spring wheat's short growth period and rapid development, advancing the sowing period, and strengthening field management. The sowing period was generally advanced by 10 days to half a month compared to previous years, seed treatment was universally carried out, and seed fertilizer, early topdressing, and early watering were applied in conjunction with early sowing. The system of four requirements being met in the fields (targets, measures, work points, and management personnel) was implemented, and a five-check (check seedlings and replant, check weeding, check irrigation, check topdressing, check pests and diseases) and five-prevention (prevent pests and diseases, prevent frost, prevent hail, prevent lodging, prevent trampling) movement was launched, achieving timely weeding, watering, topdressing, and prevention of natural disasters, continuously transforming second- and third-class fields into first-class fields, transforming first-class fields into high-yield fields, and transforming high-yield fields into super-high-yield fields. This is the key to achieving this year's bumper harvest of spring wheat.

Although spring wheat has had a bumper harvest this year, the development of production in various regions is still very uneven. Even in those high-yield areas, the potential for production increase is still very large. Taking Dunhuang County, which has a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, as an example, the wheat fields this year were only plowed six inches deep, and the wheat was only watered twice during the growth period. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu was only 12,000 jin of livestock manure, the planting density per mu was less than 500,000 ears, the "Bai Datou" variety planted was mixed, and there were still lodging defects. In Hezheng County, which has a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, wheat rust is still very serious. If further measures are taken, the yield can be greatly increased.

Increasing wheat production has become one of the most important tasks on the food production front, and it is necessary to vigorously develop spring wheat production in spring wheat areas. Various regions must seriously summarize this year's experience in increasing spring wheat production, formulate next year's spring wheat planting plan and high-yield plan, and prepare in advance to strive for a greater bumper harvest of spring wheat next year.

Xinhua News Agency, October 12th - The Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China issued a communique on rapeseed production in 1958. The full text is as follows:

This year, rapeseed production has made great achievements, beginning to change the backward situation of oilseed production. The national rapeseed planting area was 37.92 million mu, and the total output reached more than 27 million dan, an increase of about 10 million dan compared to rapeseed in 1957, an increase of 56.5%.

The yield per unit area averaged 73 jin per mu nationwide, an increase of 41.5% compared to last year. There are six provinces and cities with an average yield of over 100 jin per mu, including: Shanghai City with an average of 200 jin per mu, Gansu Province with 155 jin, Qinghai Province with 130 jin, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with 125 jin, Jiangsu Province with 117 jin, and Sichuan Province with 102 jin.

Large-area high-yield examples can be found everywhere: the average yield per mu in Nanhui, Xinghua, and Taicang in Jiangsu Province, and Zhong County in Sichuan Province, is over 200 jin. The average yield per mu in Nanhui reached 252 jin. The average yield per mu in Zhong County reached 231 jin, and the average yield per mu in Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, reached 176 jin. There are five counties in Zhejiang Province, including Cixi, and six counties in Hubei Province, including Songzi, with an average yield of over 150 jin per mu.

The national record for yield per mu has been broken at over 1,000 jin. A 2.1 mu rapeseed field in the First Agricultural Cooperative of Minji Township, Macheng, Hubei Province, yielded 1,146 jin per mu. A 3 mu rapeseed field in the First Cooperative of Yuwang Township, Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, yielded 1,050 jin per mu. A 3 mu high-yield rapeseed field in the Xianfeng Cooperative, Chenbei Township, Yingcheng, Hubei Province, yielded 860 jin per mu. A 3 mu high-yield rapeseed field in the Gaochao Cooperative, suburban Hefei City, Anhui Province, yielded 758 jin per mu. A 1.302 mu spring rapeseed field in Delingha Farm, Qinghai Province, yielded 2,161 jin per mu. This year, many places have also discovered rapeseed kings. Anhui Province discovered one with 12,000 pods; Jiangsu Province discovered one with 14,000 pods; Sichuan Province discovered one with 60,000 pods (generally 200 to 300 pods per plant).

The main reasons for this year's rapeseed harvest are that various regions have continuously strengthened their leadership over rapeseed production under the brilliant light of the general line, implemented the policy of comprehensive leap forward in grain, cotton, and oil, overcome natural disasters, strengthened rapeseed field management, leaders at all levels have implemented division of labor and were responsible at each level, many counties, townships, and cooperatives have established rapeseed experimental fields, carried out high-yield competitions, organized visits and comparisons, encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, and promoted the high tide of rapeseed production.

This year, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of rapeseed in various regions increased by about 50% to one time for base fertilizer. Topdressing was generally applied one or two more times than in previous years. Songzi County, Hubei Province, adopted the method of "six applications and two supplements" (i.e., applying base fertilizer, seedling fertilizer, strong seedling fertilizer, insulation fertilizer, moss fertilizer, and flower fertilizer, supplementing backwardness, and supplementing balance), and evenly applying fertilizer in small and frequent applications. Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, carried out four topdressings throughout the county on the basis of applying sufficient base fertilizer: the first was for stable roots, the second was for branching, the third was for flowering to the top, and the fourth was for seed setting like fish eyes. About half of the rapeseed fields nationwide were topdressed with moss fertilizer and flower fertilizer.

This year, the area planted with improved rapeseed varieties reached 20 million mu, an increase of more than 10 million mu compared to last year. Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, planted more than 46,000 mu of rapeseed throughout the county, expanding the area of improved varieties by more than 17,500 mu. Improved varieties increased production by 45% compared to local varieties, with a total increase of more than 370,000 jin. Songzi County, Hubei Province, planted more than 30,000 mu of Shengli rapeseed throughout the county, with an average yield of 250 jin per mu, an increase of 120% compared to local rapeseed. Other local improved varieties such as Xishui rapeseed white in Hubei Province, Xinghua rapeseed in Jiangsu Province, Dongkou sweet rapeseed in Hunan Province, and Gongchenqiao rapeseed in Sichuan Province, are all early-maturing and high-yielding local improved varieties, and the planting area has greatly increased. Improved varieties have been basically popularized throughout Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province.

Great achievements have been made in overcoming natural disasters. In the sowing stage of winter rapeseed last year, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces launched a vigorous drought-resistant sowing campaign, overcoming the long-term drought last year. Last winter and this spring, the main rapeseed producing areas were hit by multiple cold waves. In Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, a cold wave in mid-February caused the temperature to drop below minus 10 degrees Celsius, and rivers and ports were frozen for more than ten days. "Back to spring cold" also appeared in the central China area. In early March, there was a heavy snowstorm. However, the broad masses of farmers did not bow their heads to the disaster. After issuing a cold wave forecast in February, Zhejiang Province went into action overnight to prevent frost damage, adopting methods such as smoking, clearing snow, and watering manure to melt snow when the cold wave came. Other provinces also implemented measures such as applying winter fertilizer or covering lake grass, sweeping snow from flower moss, and timely ditching and drainage. Because of the quick action and great efforts, rapeseed in most areas did not suffer losses from frost damage.

However, this year's rapeseed production is still unbalanced. Some places failed to prepare well before sowing, and deep plowing and close planting were not sufficient. In many places, cultivation was still extensive, there were many missing seedlings, and no serious efforts were made to check seedlings and replant, and the area of abandoned land was still quite large. If deep plowing and close planting had been implemented from last year, and early field management of rapeseed had been strengthened, the yield could have been greatly exceeded this year.

In order to continue to encourage farmers to increase oilseed production and strive for a greater rapeseed harvest next year, it is necessary to vigorously promote rapeseed production and increase the yield per unit area in each province to 200 to 300 jin or more. In order to achieve this goal, all regions should formulate a leap forward plan for rapeseed production next year on the basis of summarizing this year's experience in achieving high yields of rapeseed, strengthen leadership over rapeseed production, implement division of labor and management by specialized personnel, seize the current sowing of winter rapeseed, ensure that one mu is planted and one mu is harvested, and do not use rapeseed as green manure. Strengthen cultivation and management from sowing to harvest, from beginning to end, vigorously promote water, fertilizer, soil, improved varieties, close planting, and tool reform, resolutely fight against waterlogging, drought, frost, and pests and diseases, do not relax at any stage, cultivate large-area high-yield fields, eliminate backward fields with yields below 200 jin, and strive for a greater rapeseed harvest.

    早稻春小麦油菜空前丰收
    农业部发表公报说：早稻总产量比去年增长126％，春小麦增长63％，油菜增长56.5％
    新华社12日讯中华人民共和国农业部1958年早稻生产公报。全文如下：
    今年早稻获得了大丰收。全国一亿四千六百多万亩早稻，平均亩产五百九十六斤。总产稻谷八百七十多亿斤。单位面积产量比1957年的三百二十七斤，增加二百六十九斤，即增长82％。总产量比1957年三百八十七亿斤，增加四百八十多亿斤，即增长126％。今年早稻增产数，比第一个五年计划期间稻谷产量逐年递增总数多一百二十多亿斤。
    今年全国早稻亩产千斤以上的共有一千五百多万亩。占早稻播种面积10％以上。其中三千斤到五千斤的有十四万亩左右，五千斤到一万斤的有二万五千亩左右。千斤省市有四个。江苏省二百六十四万亩，平均亩产一千零四十斤。湖北省四百六十二万多亩，平均亩产一千零三十三斤。上海市四万九千四百亩，平均亩产一千零一十九斤。安徽省六百一十二万九千多亩，平均亩产一千零五斤。早稻亩产千斤以上的县（市）共有一百一十五个，计：湖北省三十个，江苏省二十一个，安徽省二十个，浙江省十四个，四川省十二个，云南省十一个，湖南省四个，贵州省二个，广西省一个。亩产量最高的是湖北省孝感县，全县三十万二千多亩早稻，平均亩产一千八百五十五斤。其次是江苏省涟水县，三万四千七百亩早稻，平均亩产一千五百斤。安徽省桐城县四十五万三千亩早稻，平均亩产一千四百八十五斤。安徽省郎溪县幸福乡一万六千四百五十亩早稻，平均亩产三千零八斤，仅一季早稻，全乡每人平均即达五千一百零四斤粮食。
    今年早稻亩产万斤以上的高额丰产田，有三百多亩。湖北省麻城县平清乡第二农业社一亩零一厘试验田，亩产一万六千二百六十斤。安徽省枞阳县高丰社一亩零四厘二毫试验田，平均亩产一万六千二百二十七斤。湖南省醴陵县鳌仙社一亩四分五厘试验田，平均亩产一万五千六百六十五斤。湖北省麻城县麻溪河乡建国第一农业社一亩零一厘六毫早稻，采用并秧办法，平均亩产干谷达三万六千九百五十六斤。
    今年早稻大丰收，是贯彻执行了社会主义总路线的结果；是经过全民整风、反右派斗争，大胆革新技术和向自然灾害作斗争的结果；是广大干部和群众敢想、敢说、敢干、发扬共产主义新风格的结果。
    今年早稻丰收，和其他作物一样，不是由于风调雨顺。今年南方早稻地区一般都发生了不同程度的干旱，云南省出现六十年来未有的干旱。四川省沪州专区干旱一百八十天。不少地区，从开春起，就进行了抗旱播种，抗旱插秧。插秧后，各地又批判了“靠天等雨”思想，提出了“人定胜天”“无雨也要保丰收”的口号，集中劳力，歇人不歇车，拦河打坝，开泉引水，千方百计，日夜苦干，终于战胜了干旱。6、7月间稻瘟病、稻飞虱、浮尘子，普遍发生，各地都采取了土洋结合的办法及时消灭了病虫为害。
    今年各地早稻在贯彻农业增产措施上，比以往任何一年都好。去冬今春扩大了灌溉面积，改善了灌溉设备。积肥数量，比去年增加了几倍，甚至几十倍。在耕作栽培方面，主要抓住了深耕、密植、早播、早插和一系列田间管理的技术，耕深比过去增加了一到二寸，插秧比过去增加了一到二万兜，并且适当增加了每兜插秧株数，打破了过去小株密植靠分蘖吃饭的论调，创造了多种多样插秧形式和密植方法，找出了密植增产的规律。在深耕多肥精细整地的条件下，均匀直播也是一种高度密植的方法，在适宜的播种时期，只要田里没有庄稼，就可以采用。有些单位部分稻田采用并秧办法，实行高度密植。这种办法，在旱情严重时，可以移苗就水；也可以腾出土地，多种一季。只要移苗时间适当，移植密度适当，并加强培育管理，是可以增产的，有些没有经验的单位，进行这方面的试验，也是有科学价值的。但对晚熟水稻抽穗以后，在自然条件正常的情况下，是否需要普遍提倡并秧，需要进一步研究。
    今年早稻播种插秧，一般均比去年提早一个节令。由于提早了播种时期，许多地方都采用了温床育苗，冷床育苗，油纸育苗，尼龙育苗等方法，普遍采用了湿润秧田，及时抢晴播种，防风防霜，达到防止烂秧培育壮秧的目的。在水稻生长期间，开展了以早播密植为中心的田间管理工作，采用早追肥、早灌水、早除草和多次施肥灌水的方法，充分发挥了早播密植增产作用。
    明年早稻面积要比今年扩大，单位产量要大大提高，各地要认真总结今年早稻丰产经验，做出明年早稻生产规划，为争取明年更大跃进而斗争。
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国农业部1958年春小麦生产公报。全文如下：
    继冬小麦丰收之后，今年春小麦也获得空前丰收。播种面积四千三百一十九万亩。单位面积产量二百三十三斤，比1957年增产一百零六斤，增长83％，总产量一百多亿斤，比1957年增产三十九亿多斤，增长63％，比今年夏收粮食作物生产公报中估产九十亿斤提高了十亿多斤，其他麦类未计。
    今年春小麦亩产千斤以上的面积，据初步统计有一百二十四万多亩。其中亩产二千斤到三千斤的有一万一千三百六十亩，亩产三千斤到四千斤的有四十一亩，亩产四千斤到五千斤以上的有三十八亩。以县为单位亩产千斤以上的有甘肃省的和政县和敦煌县。亩产七百斤到九百斤的有甘肃省的张掖、武威、高台、临夏县、临夏市、宁夏回族自治区的吴忠市等六个县市。亩产五百斤到七百斤的有甘肃省的玉门、康乐、古浪、永昌、山丹、民乐、广河、渭源、临潭县、兰州、玉门市，宁夏地区的中卫、中宁、宁朔、永宁县、银川市，青海省的贵德县，新疆维吾尔族自治区的乌鲁木齐等十八个县市。亩产四百斤以上，五百斤以下的有三十个县市，其中甘肃省十二个，新疆维吾尔族自治区七个，宁夏地区六个，青海省五个。
    青海省赛什克农场一点零五九亩试验田，平均亩产八千五百八十五斤。甘肃省古浪县土门乡漪泉农业社十七生产队一点二二亩试验田平均亩产六千零二十九点五斤。宁夏地区中卫县东方红农业社第一生产队一点零八亩试验田，平均亩产五千八百零一斤。
    今年各地春小麦获得丰收的主要原因是深入贯彻执行了建设社会主义的总路线，不断克服了右倾保守思想，做什么，辩什么，插红旗拔白旗，扫除了跃进道路上的一切障碍，召开现场会议，观摩评比，发扬先进，克服落后，充分发动群众，贯彻了增产措施，战胜了自然灾害。
    在去冬今春大搞水利、肥料的基础上，各地普遍地推广了水、肥、土、种、密等基本措施，特别抓住了春小麦生长期较短、发育较快的特点，提早了播种期，加强了田间管理。播种期一般比往年提早了十天到半月，普遍进行了种子处理，结合早播施用种肥，早追肥，早浇水。推行了指标、措施、工分、管理人员四到田的制度，开展了五查（查苗补苗、查锄草、查灌水、查追肥、查病虫害），五防（防病虫、防霜冻、防雹洪、防倒伏、防糟踏）运动，做到了锄草、浇水、追肥、防治自然灾害四及时，不断变二、三类田为一类田，变一类田为丰产田，变丰产田为高产田。这是取得今年春小麦丰收的关键。
    今年春小麦虽然丰收，但各地生产的发展还是很不平衡的，即在那些高产地区，增产潜力也还很大。以亩产千斤的敦煌县为例，今年麦田还只耕了六寸深，小麦生长期间只浇到二次水，平均每亩施肥量仅施用牲畜粪一万二千斤，每亩种植密度还不到五十万穗，所种的品种“白大头”品种混杂，并且还有倒伏的缺点。亩产千斤的和政县，小麦锈病还很严重，如果再进一步采取措施，产量还可以大大提高。
    增产小麦已成为粮食生产战线上重要任务之一，在春小麦地区必须大力发展春小麦生产。各地必须认真总结今年春小麦增产经验，制定明年春小麦种植计划和丰产规划，提前做好准备，力争明年春小麦更大丰收。
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国农业部1958年油菜生产公报。全文如下：
    今年油菜生产取得伟大的成就，开始改变了油料生产落后的情况。全国油菜播种面积三千七百九十二万亩，总产量达二千七百多万担，比1957年油菜增产约一千万担，即增长56.5％。
    单位面积产量全国每亩平均七十三斤，比去年增加41.5％。平均亩产在一百斤以上的有六个省市。计：上海市每亩平均二百斤，甘肃省一百五十五斤，青海省一百三十斤，新疆维吾尔族自治区一百二十五斤，江苏省一百一十七斤，四川省一百零二斤。
    大面积丰产事例到处都有：江苏省的南汇、兴化、太仓，四川省的忠县等县平均亩产都在二百斤以上，南汇亩产平均达二百五十二斤。忠县亩产平均达二百三十一斤，陕西省南郑县亩产平均达一百七十六斤。亩产平均达一百五十斤以上的浙江省有慈溪等五个县，湖北省有松滋等六个县。
    全国亩产最高纪录已突破千斤。湖北省麻城闽集乡第一农业社二亩一分油菜，亩产一千一百四十六斤。云南省富源县雨汪乡第一社有三亩油菜，亩产一千零五十斤。湖北省应城陈北乡先锋社有三亩丰产油菜，亩产八百六十斤。安徽省合肥市郊区高潮社三亩丰产油菜，亩产七百五十八斤。青海省德令哈农场一点三○二亩春油菜，亩产二千一百六十一斤。今年还有不少地方发现油菜王，安徽省发现一棵有一万二千个荚；江苏省发现一棵有一万四千个荚；四川省发现一棵有六万个荚（一般每株二百到三百个荚）。
    今年油菜丰收的主要原因是各地在总路线的光辉照耀下，不断地加强了对油菜生产的领导，贯彻了粮、棉、油全面跃进的方针，战胜了自然灾害，加强了油菜田间管理，各级领导实行分工，层层负责，不少县、乡、社建立了油菜试验田，开展丰产竞赛，组织参观评比，鼓舞了广大群众增产热情，推动了油菜生产的高潮。
    今年各地油菜每亩施肥量，基肥约增加50％至一倍。追肥一般都比往年多施了一、二次。湖北省松滋县采取了“六施二补”（即施底肥、提苗肥、壮苗肥、保温肥、苔肥和花肥，补落后、补平衡），少吃多餐的均匀施肥方法；江苏省兴化县全县在施足底肥的基础上进行四次追肥，一交稳根，二交发杈，三交开花到顶，四交结子像鱼眼睛。全国约有半数以上的油菜田，追施了苔肥和花肥。
    今年油菜良种种植面积达二千万亩，比去年增加一千多万亩。陕西省南郑县全县种油菜四万六千余亩，优良品种扩大一万七千五百余亩，良种比当地种增产45％，共可增产三十七万余斤。湖北省松滋全县种胜利油菜三万余亩，平均亩产达二百五十斤，比本地油菜增产120％。其他如湖北省浠水油菜白，江苏省兴化油菜、湖南省洞口甜油菜、四川省拱宸桥油菜等，均系早熟丰产的地方良种，播种面积均大有增加。江苏省兴化县全县良种已经基本普及。
    在战胜自然灾害方面取得了很大成绩。冬播的油菜，在去年播种阶段，湖北江西等省都开展了轰轰烈烈地抗旱播种运动，战胜了去年的长期干旱，去冬今春在油菜主要产区，又遭到多次寒流袭击，江苏省兴化县2月中旬的一次寒流，温度降至摄氏零下十度以下，河港封冻达十余天。华中一带也出现“倒春寒”，在3月上旬来了一次大风雪，但是，广大农民并没有向灾害低头，浙江省在2月间发出寒潮预报以后，各地连夜进入了防御冻害，在寒潮来时采用熏烟、清除积雪和浇水粪溶雪等办法。其他各省也实行了追施腊肥或盖湖草，打扫花苔上积雪，及时进行开沟排水等工作。由于抓得快，干劲大，大部地区油菜未受到冻害损失。
    但今年油菜生产还是不平衡的。有些地方在播种前未能作好准备，深耕密植还不够，有很多地方仍然是耕作粗放，有的缺苗很多，没有认真进行查苗补栽，废弃面积还相当多。如果从去年起贯彻深耕密植，加强油菜前期田间管理，今年产量还可大大超过。
    为了继续鼓励农民增产油料，争取明年油菜更大的丰收，必须大抓油菜生产，把各省单位面积产量分别提到二百到三百斤以上。为达到这个目的，各地应该在总结今年油菜丰产经验的基础上，制订明年油菜生产跃进计划，加强对油菜生产领导，实行分工分业专人管理，抓紧当前冬油菜的播种工作，保证种一亩收一亩，不要把油菜作绿肥。从播种到收获，从头到尾加强培育管理，大搞水、肥、土、良种、密植和工具改革，坚决战胜水旱霜冻病虫灾害，每一段都不要放松，培养大面积丰产田，消灭二百斤以下的落后田，力争油菜更大丰收。
