Making Good Steel with Native Iron

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened an on-site meeting in Tianjin to promote the experience of the Tianjin New Steel Plant in using native iron to make steel.  The workers of the New Steel Plant, together with the technical working group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, fought tenaciously against the harmful impurities – sulfur and phosphorus – in native iron, and finally succeeded in making good steel with it. Prior to this, various steel plants in Shanghai had also used native iron to make good steel. This is a significant achievement for Chinese steelworkers in steelmaking technology. This once again proves a truth taught to us by Comrade Mao Zedong: "Social wealth is created by the workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals themselves. As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not avoiding problems, but solving them with a positive attitude, any difficulty in the world can be solved." (Annotation on page 5 of Volume 1 of "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside").

Using native iron to make steel is an extremely important issue. In the next three months, modern blast furnaces will only be able to meet a quarter of the steelmaking needs with “foreign iron,” leaving three-quarters of the steel to be made with iron from native blast furnaces – “native iron.” Native iron is smelted at relatively low temperatures and, in contrast to foreign iron, contains a lot of sulfur and phosphorus, but very little silicon and manganese.  In the past, China's modern steel plants used foreign iron to make steel, and only had experience with foreign iron. Therefore, using native iron to make steel is a new subject and a technical hurdle on the current steel front.  However, this hurdle must be overcome. If we can't overcome this hurdle, the native iron that millions of people are working day and night to smelt will have no use, the task of producing 10.7 million tons of steel this year will not be completed, and China's steel industry will not be able to develop at a high speed. Now, steelworkers in Shanghai and the New Steel Plant in Tianjin have broken through this hurdle, and used facts to dispel the superstition that good steel cannot be made without foreign iron. However, there are still some steel plants that hold a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude toward using native iron to make good steel. They do not welcome native iron, and even refuse to use it. All these comrades should learn from the experience of Shanghai and Tianjin, break the superstitions in their minds, and break through this technical hurdle as soon as possible.

Using native iron to make good steel is not only an urgent problem in China's current steel production, but also has significant international scientific and technological significance if this problem is solved well. The fact that native iron is high in sulfur and phosphorus and low in silicon is a "bad" thing, but a bad thing can also be turned into a good thing, and can push us to create a new set of steelmaking methods. We know that the converter, which mainly uses native iron as raw material, was introduced from abroad. Foreigners designed the converter based on their own raw materials, and created a set of steelmaking methods. According to this steelmaking method, pig iron with less sulfur and phosphorus and a certain amount of silicon is required to make steel. Now that we want to use native iron to make good steel, we must break the shackles of this "foreign" method and create a set of steelmaking methods suitable for China's raw material conditions. Now, a large amount of native iron has been transported to the side of the steelmaking furnace, forcing people to use it. This situation is the best opportunity to create our own Chinese converter steelmaking method. As long as we have the style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to be original, we will be able to take advantage of this opportunity to create our own steelmaking method.

However, it is a pity that there are now two types of people who lack this style. One type of person refuses to use native iron. For example, when eating, they must eat foreign bread and are unwilling to eat sorghum rice. Although another type of person does not refuse to use native iron, they want to add a lot of expensive and hard-to-obtain silicon iron to adjust the native iron to suit the taste of the foreign furnace. They do not create Chinese steelmaking methods based on Chinese raw materials, but want Chinese raw materials to cater to foreign steelmaking methods. Although the performances of these two types of people are different, the fact that the compradore mentality has not been broken is consistent. They always regard foreign technical experience and conclusions as golden rules, which can only be copied and used, and dare not be changed. They dare not think, dare not act, and dare not create anything that foreigners do not have. The New Steel Plant in Tianjin has a different style. They and the technical working group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry jointly cultivated experimental plots. Under the leadership of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, they relied on the masses, and relied on the close combination of technical personnel and workers, and resolutely experimented with making steel without silicon iron. After several days and nights of hard work, they finally used 20% foreign iron and 80% native iron to make rimmed steel before National Day. Now they are confidently experimenting with using all native iron or reducing the proportion of foreign iron to make steel. The experience of the New Steel Plant in Tianjin is valuable. All steel plants should learn from their experience. We must not only learn from their technical experience, but also learn from their experience of daring to think, daring to act, daring to be original, and boldly mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, air views fully, hold great debates, and thoroughly eliminate the compradore mentality.

October is a crucial month for completing this year's steelmaking task, and whether or not we can make steel with native iron quickly and well is a crucial link in whether or not the steel production target for October can be completed. Therefore, we hope that the Party committee secretaries of each steel plant will immediately take to the front line, let politics take command, let leading cadres, technical personnel and workers combine, and run experimental plots for native iron steelmaking on a large scale. If one experiment fails, we will do it a second time, and if two fails, we will do it a third time. We must ensure that by the first ten days of October, the experiences of Tianjin and Shanghai in using native iron to make steel will be popularized throughout the country and become the experience of every steel plant, so that native iron can shine brightly in every foreign steelmaking furnace.

### 用土铁炼好钢

    用土铁炼好钢
    冶金工业部在天津召开了现场会议，推广天津新兴钢厂用土铁炼钢的经验。新兴钢厂的职工和冶金工业部的技术工作组在一起，以顽强的精神对土铁里的有害杂质——硫、磷作斗争，终于用土铁炼出好钢来了。在这以前，上海各个钢铁厂也用土铁炼出好钢。这是我国炼钢工人在炼钢技术上的一个有重大意义的成就。这再一次证明毛泽东同志教导我们的一个真理：“社会的财富是工人、农民和劳动知识分子自己创造的。只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”上册第五页按语）
    用土铁炼钢，是一个极端重要的问题。在今后三个月内，现代化高炉炼出来的铁——洋铁，只能满足炼钢需要的四分之一，有四分之三的钢必须用土高炉炼出来的铁——土铁来炼。土铁是在比较低的温度下炼出来的，它和洋铁的性质相反，含硫和磷很多，矽和锰却很少。而我国的现代化炼钢厂，过去都是用洋铁炼钢，只有洋铁炼钢的经验，而没有土铁炼钢的经验。因此，用土铁炼钢，是目前钢铁战线上一个新的课题，一个技术难关。但是，这个关非过不可。过不了这个关，几千万群众日夜苦战炼出来的土铁，就没有了用武之地，今年一千零七十万吨钢的任务就完不成，我国的炼钢工业也就不可能高速度地发展。现在，上海的炼钢工人和天津新兴钢厂的工人已经突破了这个关，用事实破除了认为非洋铁不能炼好钢的迷信。但是，还有一些钢厂，对用土铁炼好钢，抱着怀疑、观望的态度，他们不欢迎土铁，甚至拒绝使用土铁。所有这些同志都应该从上海和天津的经验中吸取教训，破除自己脑子里的迷信，尽早地突破这一道技术难关。
    用土铁炼好钢不仅是我国当前钢铁生产中的迫切问题，而且，这个问题解决得好，还具有重大的国际科学技术意义。土铁含硫和磷高，含矽低，这是一件“坏”事，但是坏事也可以变成好事，可以推动我们创造一套新的炼钢方法。我们知道，现在主要靠土铁做原料的转炉，是从外国传进来的。外国人根据自己的原料设计了转炉，创造了一套炼钢法，按照这个炼钢法，必须用含硫和磷较少而又有一定矽的生铁才能炼出钢来。现在我们要用土铁炼好钢，就必须打破这种“洋”办法的束缚，创造一套适合于中国原料情况的炼钢法。现在大量的土铁运到了炼钢炉旁，逼得人们使用它。这种形势正是创造我国自己转炉炼钢法的最好时机。只要我们有敢想、敢干、敢独创的风格，就能够乘这个时机创造出自己的炼钢法来。
    但是，可惜现在有两种人非常缺乏这种风格。一种人拒绝用土铁，譬如吃饭，一定要吃洋面包，不肯吃高粱米。另一种人虽然不拒绝用土铁，但要加很多价钱昂贵和得来不易的矽铁，把土铁调配得适合洋炉子的口味。他们不是根据中国原料创造中国的炼钢方法，而是要中国原料去迁就外国的炼钢方法。这两种人的表现虽有所不同，但贾桂思想没有打破却是一致的。他们总是把外国的技术经验和结论看作金科玉律，只能照抄搬用，不敢改动。凡是外国没有的东西，他们不敢想、不敢干、不敢创造。天津新兴钢厂却是另一种风格。他们和冶金工业部的技术工作组一起种试验田，在中共河北省委和天津市委的领导下，依靠群众，依靠技术人员和工人的密切结合，坚决试验不用矽铁炼钢。经过了几天几夜的苦战，他们终于在国庆前夕，用20％洋铁和80％土铁炼出沸腾钢来。现在他们正满怀信心地试验全用土铁或减少洋铁的配合比例来炼钢。天津新兴钢厂的经验是宝贵的。一切钢厂都应当学习他们的经验。既要学习他们的技术经验，更要学习他们敢想、敢干、敢独创，放手发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，彻底清除贾桂思想的经验。
    10月份是完成今年炼钢任务的关键性的一月，而能否又快又好地用土铁炼出钢来，又是10月份钢产量能否完成的关键性的一环。因此，我们希望各个钢厂的党委书记立即出马上阵，让政治挂帅，让领导干部、技术人员和工人结合起来，大办土铁炼钢试验田，一次试验不成再来第二次，两次不成再来第三次，一定要做到在10月上旬，把天津、上海用土铁炼钢的经验普及全国，成为每一个钢厂自己的经验，让土铁在每一个洋炼钢炉里大放光华。
