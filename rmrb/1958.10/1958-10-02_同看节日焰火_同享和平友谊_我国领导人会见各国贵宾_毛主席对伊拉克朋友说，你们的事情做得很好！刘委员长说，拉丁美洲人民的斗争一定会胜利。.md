Xinhua News Agency, October 1st. Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai watched the festival fireworks on the Tiananmen Rostrum tonight and met with the heads of delegations and prominent figures from various countries there.

    The Tiananmen Rostrum, brightly lit with red palace lanterns, was as joyous tonight as the square. Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou first watched the more varied and colorful fireworks than in previous years with the guests from various countries, and then met with the guests. Chairman Mao and others expressed a warm welcome to the friends from various countries, hoping that they would convey the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the people of their respective countries. The friends from various countries expressed to Chairman Mao and others the desire of the people of their countries to be friendly with the Chinese people and wished the Chinese people greater achievements. At this time, the Tiananmen Rostrum was filled with laughter of peace and friendship.

    When Chairman Mao met with friends from Iraq, he gave a very high evaluation of the Iraqi people's revolutionary struggle, saying, "You have done a very good job!" Mahmoud, head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, shook Chairman Mao's hand tightly and said excitedly, "All the people of Iraq support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan." Chairman Mao said, "We support each other."

    Chairman Mao met with the visiting delegation of the Indonesian National Committee. This delegation was personally sent by President Sukarno to visit China. Chairman Mao told the guests that he was very happy to have received President Sukarno's letter brought by the delegation and asked the guests to convey his greetings to President Sukarno and the Indonesian people. The Indonesian guests expressed to Premier Zhou that they wanted to learn more from China during this visit. Premier Zhou said, "China's experience can only be used as a reference for the people of all countries, because every country has its own specific circumstances."

    The famous Greek writer, Mavros, was very excited when he saw Chairman Mao. He first held Chairman Mao's hand tightly and refused to let go, and later repeatedly kissed Chairman Mao. This Greek writer had suffered twenty years of torture in prison. When he first entered prison, he learned about the heroic deeds of the Chinese Red Army's Long March. These deeds greatly encouraged his courage to fight. Since then, he had hoped to come to China to see Chairman Mao. Tonight, he said to Chairman Mao with tears of excitement, "My twenty-year wish has come true today!"

    Legal workers from six Latin American countries told Chairman Liu Shaoqi that seeing the great strength of the Chinese people had increased their confidence in the victory of the anti-colonialist struggle. Chairman Liu said that your struggle will surely be victorious. The Chinese and Latin American people should unite to defend peace, and the people of all countries in the world should unite to defend peace.

    Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou met with the American progressive female writer, Anna Louise Strong. Strong had lived in Yan'an more than ten years ago and had written many books introducing the Chinese revolution. As soon as they met, Chairman Mao asked Strong caringly, "How is your health? Are you well!" And said, "We must unite and fight together." Premier Zhou Enlai asked Strong, "When you were in Yan'an ten years ago, you didn't expect China to develop so fast, did you?" Strong smiled and said, "At that time, I believed that the Chinese revolution would surely be victorious, but I really didn't expect the victory to be so fast. China's achievements are truly amazing!"

    同看节日焰火　同享和平友谊
    我国领导人会见各国贵宾
    毛主席对伊拉克朋友说，你们的事情做得很好！刘委员长说，拉丁美洲人民的斗争一定会胜利。
    新华社1日讯　毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理，今晚在天安门城楼上观看了节日的焰火，并且在这里接见了各国代表团的负责人和著名人士。
    亮彻着红色宫灯的天安门城楼上，今晚和广场上一样地欢乐。毛主席、朱副主席、刘委员长和周总理，首先同各国来宾们一起观看了比往年更加丰富多彩的焰火，然后，同各国来宾们会见。毛主席等向各国朋友们表示了热烈的欢迎，希望他们把中国人民的深情友谊转达给各国人民。各国朋友们向毛主席等表达了各国人民愿意同中国人民友好的愿望，祝愿中国人民取得更大的成就。这时候的天安门城楼是一片和平和友谊的谈笑声。
    毛主席在会见伊拉克朋友们的时候，对伊拉克人民的革命斗争给予了极高的评价，他说：“你们的事情做得很好！”伊拉克人民友好访华代表团团长马哈茂德紧握着毛主席的手，十分激动地说：“伊拉克的全体人民都支持中国人民解放自己领土台湾的正义斗争。”毛主席说：“我们是互相支持。”
    毛主席会见了印度尼西亚民族委员会访问团。这个访问团是苏加诺总统亲自派来中国参观访问的。毛主席告诉客人们，他很高兴地收到了代表团带来的苏加诺总统的信，并请客人们转达他对苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚人民的问候。印度尼西亚贵宾向周总理表示，要在这次参观访问中，更多地向中国学习。周总理说：“中国的经验只能供各国人民参考。因为各个国家都有自己的具体情况。”
    希腊著名作家马佛洛斯看到毛主席的时候非常激动，他起先紧紧拉着毛主席的手不肯放松，后来又一再同毛主席亲吻。这位希腊作家，曾在监狱里受了二十年的折磨，他在初进监狱的时候，就知道了中国红军长征的英雄事迹，这些事迹曾大大鼓舞了他的斗争勇气。从那时起，他就盼望能到中国来看看毛主席。今晚他含着兴奋的泪水对毛主席说：“我二十年的愿望今天实现了！”
    拉丁美洲六个国家的法律工作者向刘少奇委员长表示，看到了中国人民的强大力量以后，使他们增加了反殖民主义斗争的胜利信心。刘委员长说，你们的斗争一定会胜利。中国和拉丁美洲人民应团结起来保卫和平，全世界各国人民都应该团结起来保卫和平。
    毛主席、朱副主席、刘委员长和周总理会见了美国进步女作家史特朗。史特朗十多年前曾在延安住过，她曾写过不少介绍中国革命的书籍。毛主席一见面就关怀地问史特朗：“身体怎么样？好吧！”又说：“我们要团结起来，共同进行斗争。”周恩来总理问史特朗：“十年前在延安的时候，没想到中国会发展得这样快吧？”史特朗笑着说：“当时相信中国革命一定会胜利，但的确没有想到胜利那样快。中国的成就实在惊人！”
