In the season of autumn harvest and autumn planting, more than 20,000 children in Daxing District, Beijing, launched a "Young Pioneers September" campaign to participate in the autumn harvest. This freed up more than 8,500 laborers in the district to engage in deep plowing, fertilizer delivery, and wheat planting.

With children participating in labor, the schools have arranged the curriculum well and organized production teams. The Young Pioneers brigade has been transformed into an autumn harvest battle group. The children's labor is divided according to different ages. Children over 14 years old beat corn stalks, those between 12 and 13 years old thresh corn and cut beans, and those under 11 years old handle transportation and pick up bean grains. More than 40 children from Liuminzhuang Elementary School also organized a "Grain Returning Home Team," and in one day, they picked up more than 110 jin of bean grains.

    在秋收的季节里
    在秋收秋种的季节里，北京市大兴区二万多名少年儿童开展一个“红领巾9月”运动，参加秋收，使全区腾出了八千五百多名劳动力从事深翻地、送肥、种麦。
    少年儿童参加劳动，学校里都很好地安排了课程，并组织生产的队伍，少先队大队变为秋收战斗团。孩子们的劳动，按照不同的年龄有所分工，十四岁以上的少年打玉米秸，十二至十三岁的搿玉米、割豆子，十一岁以下的搞运输、拣豆粒等。留民庄小学四十多名儿童还组织了一个“颗粒还家队”，一天内，他们拾豆粒一百一十多斤。
