Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: This year, China's cotton harvest is unprecedented. According to preliminary yield estimates, the total output of ginned cotton may reach approximately 70 million dan, with an average yield of approximately 80 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Both the total output and the yield per unit area will more than double compared to 1957. The growth rate of total cotton output this year alone is equivalent to more than 20 times the annual incremental rate during the First Five-Year Plan period. The total output of ginned cotton will greatly exceed that of the United States (the United States estimated in August that its total cotton output this year would be 11.58 million bales, equivalent to approximately 52 million dan).
    Currently, cotton is generally entering its peak harvest season across the country, and cotton-producing areas are universally exhibiting large-scale, high-yield, and bumper harvest scenes. In 1957, there were 4.21 million mu of cotton fields nationwide with a yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and five counties and cities with an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu emerged. According to preliminary predictions based on the current cotton growth situation this year, a number of provinces with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu and dozens of high-yield counties with a yield of over 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu will emerge. The average yield in Shaanxi Province may reach over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. There is also great hope that Zhejiang, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces will achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in their cotton fields. In addition, a number of counties with a yield of double 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu will emerge in Hebei, Shanxi, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Gansu, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions. In the past few years, the high-yield records of over 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu that appeared in various major cotton-producing areas were obtained in small areas of a few mu. This year, after applying the experience of high yields in small areas to large areas, some high-yield fields with an average yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu will appear in large areas of several hundred mu or several thousand mu.
    In the past, so-called low-yield cotton areas have also jumped into the ranks of high-yield areas this year. For example, the 1.4 million mu of cotton fields in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, are expected to reach 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in preliminary yield estimates, more than three times higher than the yield per unit area in 1957 and more than eight times higher than in 1955.
    The main reason for the increase in cotton production this year is the adherence to putting politics in command, breaking superstitions, liberating thoughts, and resolutely struggling against right-leaning conservatives on the basis of the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist struggle. Important advanced technical measures to ensure increased cotton production are early sowing, appropriate close planting, and careful pruning. This year, after the rectification movement, people paid high attention to these measures and carried out universal promotion and improvement. After late July, the Party committees in various places led the masses to break the cotton "finalized theory" of right-leaning conservatives, and set off a nationwide upsurge. Because all three types of cotton fields continuously strengthened management, they caught up with the second or first class cotton fields, creating favorable conditions for large-area balanced production increase.
    Another reason for the increase in cotton production this year is that the soil, fertilizer, and water conditions in cotton-producing areas have been greatly improved. The cotton fields in the five provinces of North China generally underwent deep plowing last winter, generally deepening the plowing layer by more than two inches compared to last year. The double-cropping cotton fields in the south also underwent deep middle plowing in the wheat rows before sowing. The amount of base fertilizer in cotton fields has generally increased by two or three times compared to the past, with many cotton fields applying more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu; topdressing fertilizer is applied two or three times less, and up to seven or eight times more.

    棉花总产量压倒美国
    据新华社30日讯　今年我国棉花空前大丰收。据初步测产预计皮棉总产量可达七千万担左右，平均每亩皮棉产量八十斤左右。总产量和单位面积产量都将比1957年增产一倍以上。今年一年棉花总产量的增长速度，相当第一个五年计划期间每年递增速度的二十多倍。皮棉总产量将大大超过了美国（美国在8月间测产，预计今年棉花总产量为一千一百五十八万包，折合五千二百万担左右）。
  现在各地棉花普遍进入了收获盛期，各个产棉区棉花普遍显露了大面积高额丰产的景象。1957年全国亩产百斤皮棉以上的棉田共有四百二十一万亩，曾出现五个平均亩产百斤皮棉县市。今年从目前棉花生长情况初步预测，将会出现一批亩产百斤皮棉的省和几十个亩产二百斤皮棉以上的丰产县。陕西省平均亩产可达到百斤皮棉以上。浙江、湖北、山西三省棉田实现亩产百斤皮棉也大有希望。此外，河北、山西、湖北、河南、山东、江苏、浙江、甘肃、新疆等省区，都将出现一批亩产双百斤皮棉县。过去几年来，在各个主要产棉区出现的亩产千斤籽棉以上的高额丰产纪录，都是在几亩地的小面积获得的，今年各地把小面积高额丰产经验在大面积上加以运用后，将在几百亩几千亩的大面积上出现一些平均亩产千斤籽棉的高产田。
    过去所谓低产棉区，今年也跃上高产行列。例如，河南省南阳专区一百四十万亩棉田，初步测产可达到亩产皮棉百斤，比1957年单位面积产量提高三倍多，比1955年提高八倍以上。
    今年棉花增产的主要原因是在整风反右派斗争胜利的基础上坚持政治挂帅，破除迷信，解放了思想，和右倾保守主义者进行了坚决斗争。棉花保证增产的重要先进技术措施是提早播种，适当密植，精细整枝等。今年经过整风运动，人们对这些措施引起了高度的重视，进行了普遍推广和提高。7月下旬以后，各地党委领导群众打破了右倾保守主义者的棉花“定局论”，掀起了全国各三类棉田由于不断地加强管理，赶上了二类或一类棉田，为大面积平衡增产创造了有利条件。
    今年棉花增产的另一个原因，是产棉区的土、肥、水条件进行了大大改善。华北五省的棉田去冬都普遍进行了深耕，一般比去年加深耕层两寸以上。南方两熟棉田播种前也在麦行进行了深中耕。棉田基肥量一般比过去增加了两、三倍，许多棉田每亩施基肥在万斤以上；施追肥少的两、三次，多的达到七、八次。
