Which County Has High Grain Yield?
Shou Zhang County Yields 5,000 Jin Per Mu

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Hu Lei reports: Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, has achieved an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture this year. The county's average yield of grain crops is expected to reach 5,000 jin per mu, a more than tenfold increase in one year.

The 14,000 mu of spring corn that Shou Zhang County has already harvested yielded an average of 5,030 jin per mu; the 100,000 mu of sweet potatoes interplanted with corn yielded an average of 1,300 jin per mu; and the 52,000 mu of millet yielded an average of 5,151 jin per mu. High-yield "satellites" have taken flight in droves. There are 313 mu of millet "satellite" fields yielding 10,000 to 20,000 jin, and 6.1 mu yielding more than 20,000 jin; there are 396 mu of corn "satellite" fields yielding more than 10,000 jin, and 13.2 mu yielding more than 20,000 jin. The autumn corn harvest has now begun, with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu. The 300,000 mu of sweet potatoes generally have 5 or 6 jin of potatoes per plant, and in large areas of high-yield fields, there are more than 20 jin per plant. It is estimated that the minimum yield per mu will reach more than 20,000 jin. Soybeans, which were always known as a low-yield crop, are expected to yield an average of more than 500 jin per mu in a large area of 120,000 mu this year. The total output of the county's 500,000 mu of grain crops is estimated to reach more than 2.5 billion jin, with an average yield of 5,000 jin per mu, an increase of more than sixteen times compared to last year's 290 jin per mu.

The agricultural bumper harvest in Shou Zhang County is first and foremost a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism. It is the result of establishing communist ideology, promoting communist style, and thoroughly changing natural conditions. Since last winter, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the Party and the people of Shou Zhang County have defeated several attacks by right-leaning conservatives within and outside the Party, removed 336 white flag cadres, changed eight white flag communes, and 167 white flag teams, cultivated 65,000 red and expert activists, planted red flags all over the county, and highly developed people's subjective initiative, so that crops grow according to people's will, and yields increase according to people's ideals. The first experience that the broad masses summarized from this year's bumper harvest is "Land is a treasure trove with unlimited potential, there is no end to increasing production, it all depends on strong determination, as long as we work hard, we can produce more grain." Indeed, the people of Shou Zhang County, in order to realize the production increase plan, never left the construction site from the severe cold weather last winter to the hot summer this year. Cadres and the masses all ate and lived in the fields. The county completed a total of 4.48 million labor days from last year to the present, 57% more than last year. The infrastructure completed 6.72 million cubic meters of earthwork. The entire county has achieved water conservancy, the sandy land has been deep plowed once, and fertilizer has increased from 8,000 jin per mu last year to 200,000 jin. The number of pigs increased from 200,000 last year to 400,000. The natural landscape has been fundamentally changed.

The Party and government leaders and all cadres of Shou Zhang County have carried forward the fine tradition of the Party's mass line, taking the lead in everything, setting an example in everything, and consulting with the masses in everything. The 28 members of the county party secretary and county party committee are often in the fields, averaging more than 200 days a year in the countryside, participating in physical labor for 90 days. All 8,795 cadres in the county cultivated 28,442 mu of experimental fields, releasing 5,392 mu of high-yield "satellites"; and motivated 65,000 red and expert activists to engage in experimental fields and learn technology. At every large and small meeting, the county party committee conscientiously implemented the leadership method of large-scale airing of views, large-scale blooming, and large-scale debates. Over the past year, the masses posted more than 5 million big-character posters and put forward more than 4 million rationalization proposals, greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. This is the second experience of Shou Zhang County's agricultural bumper harvest.

The agricultural bumper harvest in Shou Zhang County is also due to breaking through several barriers in agricultural technology, greatly enriching China's agricultural science. They broke superstition, boldly innovated, broke through the shackles of old scientific theories, and touched the temperament of crops growth. In addition to firmly grasping the basic key to increasing production, such as turning the land two feet deep, applying 200,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, turning all land into paddy fields, and eliminating pests, they have new experiences in dense planting, preventing lodging, corn pollination, and fertilization methods. For example, in dense planting, corn was generally planted at 1,800 plants per mu in the past, but this year it is generally 4,000 to 5,000 plants, and 8,000 plants (double plants) in high-yield fields and "satellite" fields; due to the creation of phased corn pollination, there is not a single empty plant. Millet used to be 40,000 to 50,000 plants, and scientists generally believed that the most it could be planted was 80,000 plants, but Shou Zhang County generally plants 100,000 to 150,000 plants this year, and "satellite" fields plant more than 260,000 plants.

Currently, the Shou Zhang County Committee of the Communist Party of China is leading the county's farmers, under the slogan of "continue to work hard for three years and strive to realize a 10,000-jin county next year," celebrating the harvest on the one hand and starting the tense autumn sowing movement on the other.

    哪县粮食产量高？
    寿张县亩产五千斤
    本报讯　记者胡雷报道：山东省寿张县今年农业全面大丰收。全县粮食作物预计亩产量平均可达五千斤，产量一年翻了十几番。
    寿张县已经收获的一万四千亩春玉米，平均亩产五千零三十斤；十万亩地瓜间种的玉米，平均亩产一千三百斤；五万二千亩谷子，平均亩产五千一百五十一斤。高产“卫星”已经成群结队的飞上天空。谷子万斤到两万斤的“卫星”田有三百一十三亩，两万斤以上的六点一亩；玉米万斤以上的“卫星”田三百九十六亩，两万斤以上的十三点二亩。秋玉米现已开始收割，亩产量达三千斤。三十万亩地瓜，一般每墩已长瓜五、六斤重，大面积丰产田，每墩已结二十多斤，预计亩产量最低能达两万多斤。过去一向被称为低产作物的大豆，而今年在十二万亩的大面积里，平均亩产可达五百多斤。全县五十万亩粮食作物预计总产量能达二十五亿多斤，平均亩产五千斤，比去年亩产二百九十斤增产十六倍多。
    寿张县的农业大丰收首先是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是树立共产主义思想，发扬共产主义风格，彻底改变自然条件的结果。去冬以来，寿张县的党和人民，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，战胜了党内外的右倾保守主义者的几次进攻，拔掉了三百三十六名白旗干部，改变了八个白旗社，一百六十七个白旗队，培养出红专积极分子六万五千人，把红旗插遍全县，高度发挥了人们的主观能动性，使作物按照人们的意志生长，产量按照人们的理想增加。广大群众总结今年大丰收的第一条经验是“地是万宝囊，潜力无限量，增产无止境，单靠决心强，只要干劲大，就能多打粮”。的确，寿张县的人民，为了实现增产计划，从去冬严寒的天气，到今年酷热的夏天，从没离开过工地，干部群众都是吃住在田间。全县从去年到现在共干劳动工四百四十八万个，比去年多57％。基建完成六百七十二万土方工程，全县已经实现水利化，沙地已经深翻一遍，肥料由去年每亩八千斤增到二十万斤，毛猪由去年二十万头增至四十万头。根本改变了自然面貌。
    寿张县的党政领导和全体干部，发扬了党的群众路线的优良传统，事事带头干，事事做样子，事事和群众商量。县委书记和县委委员共二十八名，都是经常在田间，一年平均下乡二百天以上，参加体力劳动九十天。全县干部有八千七百九十五名搞了二万八千四百四十二亩试验田，放出了五千三百九十二亩高产“卫星”；带动了六万五千名红专积极分子都搞试验田，学技术。县委在每次大小会议上，都认真贯彻了大鸣大放大辩论的领导方法，一年来群众贴出大字报五百多万张，提出合理化建议四百多万条，大大发挥了群众的积极性。这是寿张县农业大丰收的第二条经验。
    寿张县的农业大丰收还由于在农业技术上冲破了几道关，大大丰富了我国的农业科学。他们打破迷信，大胆独创，冲破了旧的科学理论的束缚，摸着了庄稼生长的脾气。他们除了紧紧抓住了地翻二尺、亩施肥二十万斤、全部变成水田、消灭虫害等基本增产关键以外，在密植、防倒伏、玉米授粉、施肥方法上都有新的经验。如密植，往年玉米一般每亩一千八百株，今年一般到四、五千株，丰产田、“卫星”田到八千株（双株）；由于创造玉米分期授粉，竟没有一株空棵。谷子往年是四、五万棵，一般科学家认为顶多种到八万株，而寿张县今年一般是十万株到十五万株，“卫星”田种到二十六万多株。
    目前，中共寿张县委正带领全县农民，在“继续苦战三年，争取明年实现万斤县”的口号下，一面欢庆丰收，一面开始了紧张的秋种运动。
