Workers at Shanghai Machine Tool Plant Can Both Manufacture and Design
　　
Shanghai, October 13th (Reporter Gao Jie) – In the technical revolution movement, the workers of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant are determined to be both machine tool manufacturers and designers.

Beginning in late August, all workers and technicians in the plant studied blueprints together, dissected machine tools, and everyone participated in design. They broke away from process regulations and launched a major revolution focusing on reforming product structure. They plan to review and revise all design drawings and process regulations for more than a dozen machine tools currently in production and those to be produced this year, aiming to reduce product processing time by one million hours. This way, they can complete eight months' worth of work in the remaining months before the end of the year, ensuring the annual production of 4,600 machine tools and striving to achieve the leap forward plan of 5,000 units (the initial plan was 1,400 units).

There was once a debate about whether workers could engage in technical revolutions in design and technology. Some technicians believed that design drawings were "laws," that workers did not understand design and could not infringe upon the drawings, and that workers could only "slightly" participate in technical revolutions by improving tools, equipment, and operating methods. However, the workers believed that complex machine tool structures and unreasonable process regulations caused significant waste of manpower and resources in production. To carry out a technical revolution, they had to "greatly" address these aspects. The Party committee supported the workers' views, believing that the current situation where design and process work was controlled by a small number of technicians had to be broken. The vast masses of workers, who had accumulated rich experience in long-term production practice and were therefore very familiar with the structure, performance, and processing technology of machine tools, should be the masters of the products and have the power to decide on product design and technology.

The new technical revolution movement adopts a rectification style, with the specific approach of "three combinations," bringing together leaders, workers, and technicians to carry out extensive airing of views, major rectification, and major changes.

When the workers saw the leaders' determination, their enthusiasm soared. In just one week, they put forward more than 12,000 suggestions.

The large number of suggestions demonstrated the workers' extraordinary talents, and even some "international standards" regarded as golden rules by some technicians were broken. For example, the control box produced by the hydraulic workshop is the heart of the precision grinder and has a very complex structure. Two years ago, a foreign expert improved it, simplifying the original forty-plus parts to fourteen. Therefore, the engineers believed that no further improvements were possible. However, on the second day after the work team went to the workshop, veteran worker Wu Delun took out an improved drawing. According to his suggestion, not only could seven more parts be eliminated and two control valves reduced, but also the problem of the original control box shaking when it was started was solved. This fact greatly educated the technicians.

The Party committee of the Machine Tool Plant believes that letting workers be the masters of the products, making them both producers and designers, is not only a mass line issue in the technical revolution, but also the direction that technical work should adhere to in future daily production.

    人人动手简化机床结构
    上海机床厂工人们既会制造又会设计
    本报上海13日电　记者高洁报道：在技术革命运动中，上海机床厂的工人们立志既要做机床的制造者，也要做机床的设计者。
    从8月下旬开始，全厂工人和技术人员一道研究图纸，解剖机床，人人参与设计，大破工艺规程，展开了一场以改革产品结构为主要内容的大革命。他们准备把目前正在生产的和今年将要生产的十多种机床的设计图纸和工艺规程全部加以审查修改，要求缩短产品加工工时一百万小时。这样就可以在年底以前的几个月内完成八个月的工作量，确保全年生产四千六百台机床，力争实现五千台（年初计划是一千四百台）的跃进计划。
    工人是否可以在设计和工艺方面闹技术革命，曾经有过争论。一部分技术人员认为设计图纸是“法律”，工人不懂设计，不能侵犯图纸，工人闹技术革命，只能一般地在改进工具、设备，操作方法上“小闹”。但工人们认为机床结构复杂和工艺规程不合理，造成生产中人力物力浪费很大，要闹技术革命，就要从这方面“大闹”。党委会支持工人的主张，认为目前设计和工艺工作由少数技术人员控制的局面必须打破，在长期生产实践中积累了丰富的经验，因而对机床的结构、性能、加工工艺十分熟悉的工人群众，应该作产品的主人，有决定产品设计和工艺的大权。
    新的技术革命运动采取整风方式，具体做法是“三结合”，把领导、工人、技术人员三方面结合在一起，开展大放大鸣，大整大改。
    工人们看到领导决心大，积极性就很高涨，仅仅一个星期，就提出建议一万二千多条。
    大量的建议显示了工人的非凡的才能，甚至某些技术人员奉为金科玉律的“国际标准”也被打破了。例如液压车间生产的操纵箱是精密磨床的心脏，结构非常复杂。两年前，曾由一位外国专家加以改进，把原来的四十多个零件简化为十四个。因此，工程师们都认为再不可能改进了。但是，就在工作队下车间的第二天，老工人吴德伦就拿出一张改进的图纸，根据他的建议，不但可以再省去七个零件，减少两个操纵阀，还同时解决了原来的操纵箱开动时跳动的毛病。这个事实给技术人员以很大的教育。
    机床厂党委认为让工人作产品的主人，使工人既做生产者，又做设计者，不仅是技术革命中的群众路线问题，也是今后日常生产中技术工作应该坚持的方向问题。（附图片）
