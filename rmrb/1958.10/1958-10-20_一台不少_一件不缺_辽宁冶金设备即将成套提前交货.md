Not a Single Unit Less, Not a Single Component Missing
	Liaoning Metallurgical Equipment to be Delivered in Complete Sets Ahead of Schedule

	(Our report) The workers of various machinery factories in Liaoning Province, in order to support the development of the iron and steel industry in various regions, overcame various difficulties and rushed to manufacture a large number of complete sets of metallurgical equipment.

	In late August, the machinery factories in Liaoning received the task of manufacturing more than 3,100 sets of blowers, 37 blast furnaces, and 32 sets of small and medium-sized rolling mills and seamless steel tube rolling mills for various regions. As of October 13, after only more than a month of hard work, the production task of blowers had been completed by 96.9%, the task of blast furnaces had been completed by 70.6%, and the task of rolling mills and seamless steel tube rolling mills had been completed by 59.08%. It is estimated that by the end of October, except for individual medium-sized rolling mills, this batch of metallurgical equipment will be fully manufactured. After the completion of this batch of tasks, it will be able to provide the country with smelting equipment for an annual output of more than 5.7 million tons of pig iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and rolling equipment for an annual output of more than 4 million tons of steel.

	In the process of rushing to manufacture metallurgical equipment, Liaoning Province has always paid attention to solving the problem of complete sets of metallurgical equipment, resolutely ensuring that not a single unit is less, not a single component is missing, and delivering goods ahead of schedule. As early as late August, when the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee arranged the metallurgical equipment manufacturing task, it clearly stipulated, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, which factories would manufacture the main bodies of which metallurgical equipment and which factories would manufacture the accessories of which metallurgical equipment. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee repeatedly emphasized that all factories undertaking the manufacture of metallurgical equipment must, in accordance with the requirements of the state, guarantee the delivery date, guarantee product quality, and guarantee that the metallurgical equipment delivered by the province is complete and flawless. According to this requirement of the Provincial Party Committee, the Party Committees at all levels in the province made detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the production progress of the main bodies, accessories, and collaborative parts of metallurgical equipment. During the manufacturing process, the local municipal party committees and factory party committees conduct inspections every day to check the progress and quality, and do not allow any equipment that has already been manufactured to lack a single component. Although Dalian City has already manufactured a 255-cubic-meter blast furnace, it is not considered to have completed the task because it lacks a hopper. The blowers manufactured in Andong and Jinzhou cities were re-repaired because the quality was not good enough, and they were not allowed to leave the factory until the quality problems were resolved.

    一台不少　一件不缺
    辽宁冶金设备即将成套提前交货
    本报讯　辽宁省各机械工厂的职工为了支援各地发展钢铁工业，排除各种困难，赶制出大批成套的冶金设备。
    8月下旬，辽宁各机械厂接到为各地制造三千一百多台鼓风机、三十七座高炉和三十二套中小型轧钢机和无缝钢管轧机的任务。到10月13日止，只是经过一个多月的苦战，鼓风机生产任务已经完成96.9％，高炉任务已完成70.6％，轧钢机和无缝钢管轧机任务已完成59.08％。预计到10月下旬，除个别的中型轧钢机外，这批冶金设备将可以全部制成。这批任务完成以后，就可以为全国提供年产五百七十多万吨生铁、五万吨钢的冶炼设备和年产四百多万吨钢材的轧钢设备。
    辽宁省在赶制冶金设备的过程中，自始至终注意解决冶金设备的成套问题，坚决保证一台不少，一件不差，提前交货。中共辽宁省委早在8月下旬布置冶金设备制造任务的时候，就按照中央的指示，明确地规定了哪些冶金设备的主体由哪些工厂制造，哪些冶金设备的配件由哪些工厂制造。同时，省委一再强调：所有承制冶金设备的工厂都必须按照国家要求，保证交货日期，保证产品质量，保证全省拿出来的冶金设备完整无缺。全省各级党委根据省委这一要求，对于冶金设备的主体、配件和协作件的生产进度，都作了细致的全面的安排。在制造过程中，各地市委、各厂党委每天都进行检查，查进度，查质量，不许已经制成的设备缺少一个部件。旅大市虽然已经制成二百五十五立方公尺高炉，但是缺少料斗，也不算完成任务。安东、锦州两市制成的鼓风机，因为质量不够好，又重新补修，一直到质量问题解决以后，才允许出厂。
