    Since Xinhua County, Hunan Province, launched a "satellite" with a daily pig iron output of 2,000 tons on September 29, the pig iron production has been stably maintained at 1,500 tons per day, and on October 10, it rose to 2,000 tons again. From October 5 to 12, Xinyang County, Henan Province, also continuously launched high-yield steel "satellites," producing a total of 18,900 tons of steel, with an average daily output of over 2,360 tons. These two "satellites" are particularly valuable. Their value lies in their height and longevity. "Height" can dispel the superstition that indigenous methods of steelmaking and iron smelting result in low output; "Longevity" can dispel the superstition that high-yield steel and iron "satellites" cannot forever orbit in the sky. Thoroughly dispelling these two superstitions is of great significance for completing this year's plan to double steel production and for implementing the current policy of developing the steel industry with small-scale indigenous groups as the mainstay.
    Before National Day—on September 29th—a group of "satellites" centered on the iron and steel industry and transportation soared into the sky. In addition to Liaoning's daily steel and iron output already reaching 10,000 tons, eight more provinces across the country achieved daily pig iron outputs of over 10,000 tons, 73 counties achieved daily pig iron outputs of 1,000 tons, and two provinces achieved daily steel outputs of 5,000 tons and 4,000 tons respectively. On this day, China's steel production level reached a new peak, with a daily steel output of over 58,000 tons, an increase of 165% compared to the average daily output in August; and a daily iron output of over 290,000 tons, an increase of 1020% compared to the average daily output in August. Since October, new 10,000-ton provinces and 1,000-ton counties have continued to emerge. The people across the nation were greatly inspired and in high spirits upon seeing this group of "satellites" soar into the sky. The superstition that small-scale, indigenous, and mass methods of steel production cannot create high yields was thoroughly dispelled. However, since entering October, the daily steel output of many provinces and counties has fluctuated greatly, and has not yet reached the high-yield level of the pre-National Day period. Therefore, some comrades have asked: Can high-yield "satellites" forever orbit in the sky? Can the "satellite" level be transformed into the normal level? They hold a skeptical attitude towards these two questions.
    We say that this is also a kind of superstition. Doesn't Xinhua County, Hunan, achieve a daily pig iron output of 1,500 tons or more every day? Doesn't Xinyang County, Henan, achieve an average daily steel output of 2,300 tons or more? Now that we have these two high-yield "satellites" orbiting in the sky for a long time, why won't more "satellites" of this kind appear tomorrow?
    The purpose of launching "satellites" is to achieve a leap in steel production. Through the shock campaign of launching "satellites," we can train our ranks, review our work in all areas, break through the old balance, and establish a new balance. The process of preparing to launch "satellites" is the process of preparing to leap forward on a new foundation. The "satellites" soaring into the sky indicates that we have the power to leap forward. But this is only the beginning of the leap, not the end. Therefore, we must combine launching high-yield "satellites" with normal high yields and large-area bumper harvests. Not only should we fully mobilize the masses and work hard during the process of launching "satellites," but we should also make preparations to strive for normal high yields at the same time as launching "satellites," so that after the "satellites" are in the sky, we can ride the wind, break the waves, and advance victoriously, pushing the daily production level to a new peak, in order to achieve frequent high yields. If we do not combine launching "satellites" with striving for normal high yields and bumper harvests, and only launch "satellites" for the sake of launching "satellites," and relax after the "satellites" are in the sky, then, of course, the "satellites" will not forever orbit in the sky. Therefore, whether the high-yield "satellite" level can be transformed into the normal production level, and whether the "satellites" can avoid falling after they are in the sky, depends critically on whether we have the correct guiding ideology.
    The experience of Xinhua County proves that in order to make high-yield "satellites" forever orbit in the sky, we must successfully pass five checkpoints. The first is the raw materials checkpoint. This means that there must be sufficient reserves of ore and fuel to ensure that the steel and iron furnaces are well-fed. The second is the technology checkpoint. This means vigorously training technical personnel, ensuring that each furnace has a fixed furnace master; selecting and promoting good furnace types, and gradually eliminating bad furnace types. The third is the transportation checkpoint. This means organizing a specialized transportation team to be responsible for transporting ore, pig iron, fuel, and other related materials to the furnace side. The fourth is the management checkpoint. This means implementing hierarchical leadership from top to bottom, and systematically establishing Party and Youth League organizations; the distribution of tasks, the organization of competitions, and the assessment of results should all be delegated, responsible, and inspected at different levels; production plans should be handed over to the masses for discussion, and checked monthly, every ten days, and daily, so that everyone has clear responsibilities and knows what to do. The fifth is the mass life checkpoint. This means ensuring that the masses eat well, rest well, and are full of energy to fight. If any of these five checkpoints are not passed, it will not work. The main reason why high-yield "satellites" in many places cannot operate sustainably, and the output fluctuates greatly, is that these five checkpoints have not been successfully passed. Some places do not have sufficient raw materials prepared, and after launching a "satellite" for a day, the furnace suffers from "food shortage." Some places have not organized transportation teams, and there is ore but no one to transport it, and pig iron but no one to transport it. Some places have not followed up with management work, the responsibilities of the masses are unclear, and the division of labor is not fixed; today they pull the bellows, tomorrow they pound ore, in the morning they are stokers, and in the afternoon they carry coal, changing back and forth, which not only hinders the improvement of technology, but also easily causes a waste of manpower. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must carry out in-depth work, lead the masses to successfully pass these five checkpoints, have a concentrated and unified will, and make overall arrangements; each checkpoint must also have a dedicated person in charge, and each link must be closely linked, with close cooperation between the front and the rear, and between the left and the right, so that the entire iron and steel front has no weak links.
    The soaring of high-yield "satellites" is the result of carrying out mass movements. To transform the "satellite" level into the normal production level, and to launch "satellites" every day, we must carry out mass movements every day. Leading cadres must share weal and woe and breathe the same air as the masses. They must organize the masses to conduct great debates, overcome various ideological obstacles, and promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to create, as well as the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, based on the development of production at various stages. In this way, the high-yield "satellites" can be launched bigger and bigger, and higher and higher, and the task of 10.7 million tons of steel will surely be completed and overfulfilled.

### 让高产“卫星”永远在天空运转

    让高产“卫星”永远在天空运转
    湖南省新化县从9月29日发射日产生铁二千吨的“卫星”以来，生铁产量天天稳定在一千五百吨的水平，10月10日又上升到二千吨。河南省信阳县从10月5日到12日，也连续发射钢的高产“卫星”，共产钢一万八千九百多吨，每天平均也达到二千三百六十多吨以上。这两颗“卫星”特别可贵。其所以特别可贵，一是高，二是久。“高”可以破除人们认为土法炼钢、土法炼铁产量低的迷信；“久”可以破除人们认为钢铁高产“卫星”不能永远在天空运转的迷信。彻底破除这两种迷信，对于完成今年钢铁生产翻一番的计划，对于贯彻执行当前以小土群为主的发展钢铁工业的方针，有着重大的意义。
    国庆前夕——9月29日，以钢铁为中心的工业和交通运输业一群“卫星”齐上天，除了辽宁的钢和生铁的日产量早已达到万吨以外，全国又出现了八个日产万吨生铁以上的省，出现了七十三个日产千吨生铁的县和两个日产五千吨钢和一个日产四千吨钢的省。这一天，我国钢铁的生产水平登上了一个新的高峰，钢的日产量达到五万八千多吨，比8月份平均日产量增加了165％；铁的日产量达到二十九万多吨，比8月份平均日产量增加了1020％。10月份以来，新的万吨省、千吨县不断出现。全国人民看到这一群“卫星”飞上天，精神振奋，意气风发。那种认为用小、土、群办法搞钢铁不能创造高产量的迷信，是彻底地被破除了。但是，进入10月份以来，许多省和县的钢铁日产量忽高忽低，至今还没有达到国庆前夕的高产水平。因此，有些同志就问道：高产“卫星”能不能永远在天空运转？能不能把“卫星”水平变为正常的水平？他们对于这两个问题抱着怀疑的态度。
    我们说，这也是一种迷信。湖南新化县的生铁日产量，不是天天达到一千五百吨以上吗？河南信阳县的钢日产量，不是平均达到二千三百吨以上吗？今天有了这两个长久在天空运转的高产“卫星”，为什么明天不会出现更多这一类的“卫星”呢？
    放“卫星”的目的，本来就是为了使钢铁产量来一个飞跃。通过放“卫星”的突击战斗，可以锻炼我们的队伍，检阅我们的各项工作，突破旧的平衡，建立新的平衡。准备放“卫星”的过程，就是准备在新的基础上飞跃前进的过程。“卫星”上了天，表明我们有力量飞跃。但这只是飞跃的开始，而不是飞跃的终结。因此，我们必须把放高产“卫星”和正常的高产、大面积丰收结合起来。不仅在放“卫星”过程中充分发动群众，大干苦干，而且在放“卫星”的同时就要为争取正常的高产作好准备，以便“卫星”上天以后，乘风破浪，乘胜前进，把日常的生产水平推向一个新的高峰，以达到经常的高额丰产。如果不把放“卫星”和争取正常的高产丰收结合起来，为放“卫星”而放“卫星”，“卫星”上了天以后就松了劲，那末，“卫星”当然不会永远在天空运转。所以，能不能把高产“卫星”水平变为正常的生产水平，能不能使“卫星”上了天以后不掉下来，关键之一在于是不是有正确的指导思想。
    新化县的经验证明，要使高产“卫星”永远在天空运转，必须过好五个关。一曰原材料关。这就是矿石、燃料要有充分的储备，以保证炼钢炉、炼铁炉吃得饱。二曰技术关。这就是大力培训技术力量，做到炉炉有固定的炉师；要选择和推广好的炉型，逐步淘汰不好的炉型。三曰交通运输关。这就是要组织专门运输队伍，负责把矿石、生铁、燃料等有关物资运到炉边去。四曰管理关。这就是从上到下实行分级领导，系统地建立党、团组织；布置任务、组织竞赛、考核成绩都要分层下达，分层负责，分层检查；生产计划要交给群众讨论，按月、按旬、按日检查，使大家职责分明，心中有数。五曰群众生活关。这就是保证群众吃得饱，休息得好，精神饱满地进行战斗。这五个关，有一个过不了都不行。现在许多地方的高产“卫星”不能持久运转，产量忽高忽低，主要的原因就是没有过好这五个关。有的是原材料准备不充分，放了一天“卫星”以后，炉子就闹“粮荒”。有的是运输队伍没有组织起来，有矿石没人运，有生铁没人运。有的是管理工作没有跟上去，群众的职责不明，分工不固定，今天拉风箱，明天捶矿石，上午司炉，下午挑煤炭，变来变去，既妨碍技术的提高，又容易造成人力的浪费。因此，各地党委必须进行深入的工作，领导群众过好这五个关，既要有集中的统一的意志，全面的安排；每一个关又要有专人负责，要一环扣一环，前线和后方、左翼和右翼紧密配合，使整个钢铁战线没有一个薄弱环节。
    高产“卫星”上天，是大搞群众运动的结果。要把“卫星”水平变为正常的生产水平，要天天放“卫星”，就要天天搞群众运动，领导干部要同群众共甘苦，同呼吸，要根据各个时期生产发展的情况，组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，克服各种思想障碍，发扬敢想敢干敢独创的共产主义风格和互助协作的精神。这样，高产“卫星”就能越放越大，越放越高，一千零七十万吨钢的任务就一定能够完成和超额完成。
