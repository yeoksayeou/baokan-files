Combining Large, Medium, and Small; Starting from Small Indigenous Groups
Jiangxi Spreads a Powerful Power Grid

(Our Dispatch) Jiangxi Province has recently commenced construction on ten large and medium-sized hydropower and thermal power stations, while hundreds of small power stations throughout the province are also being built at an accelerated pace. To ensure the great leap forward in steel and machinery, the Party and government leadership of Jiangxi Province and the broad masses of the people are determined to overcome all difficulties and spread a power grid over the skies of Jiangxi.

The ten power stations that have recently commenced construction include five large hydropower stations, namely the Wan'an on the Gan River, the Zhelintan on the Xiu River, the Zhangshukeng on the Rao River, the Hongmen on the Fu River, and the Jiangkou on the Yuan River; and five medium-sized thermal power stations, including those in Nanchang and Pingxiang. These ten power stations have a total installed capacity of three million kilowatts, and some of them will be put into production next year. Coupled with the thousands of small power stations to be completed this year, a powerful power grid will soon be initially formed throughout the province.

The conditions for developing the power industry in Jiangxi Province are quite poor. For example, the construction of the Zhelintan Hydropower Station alone requires 2,500 tons of steel bars, 15,000 tons of cement, 250 tons of steel rails, and 3,000 technicians. However, the province currently does not have a single steel rail, and there are only slightly over 1,000 technicians, which is not enough to meet the needs of one project, let alone the requirements of ten projects. Under these circumstances, should we wait for conditions to mature, or should we actively create conditions and get started immediately? Jiangxi Province has adopted the latter approach. The CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee have held several meetings to discuss this issue, and the Provincial Committee affirmed the following two points: First, enthusiasm creates conditions, and sufficient enthusiasm can create ample conditions; second, the vanguard must go first and pave the way for the marshals, rather than waiting for the two marshals of steel and machinery to provide ample equipment and materials for the vanguard before starting.

Under the guidance of such a proactive ideology, the Party and government leadership of Jiangxi Province relies on the masses, exhausts all means to overcome difficulties, and creates conditions to strive for high-speed development of the power industry.

In terms of solving the problem of construction materials and mechanical equipment, Jiangxi's overall slogan is: "Think of more solutions and speak less." This means thinking of more solutions ourselves and asking the higher-ups for less. The Provincial Committee believes that the several large power stations should receive support from the state and assistance from fraternal provinces and regions, but even more so, they should rely on the masses for self-reliance. To this end, the Provincial Committee has taken the following measures: First, actively trial-produce and organize production. Low and high-grade cement, steel bars, and some power generation equipment are all arranged to be manufactured within the province. Currently, low and high-grade cement has been successfully fired in many counties; according to rough statistics, 30,000 tons of cement can be produced this year, and the cement required for these projects next year can basically be solved by ourselves. Giant 1,000-kilowatt generators and five-ton cranes have also been successfully trial-produced in some small factories. Second, "use small to serve large" and "use slow to alleviate urgency." Construction sites of power stations need a large number of steel rails for transportation. Various places dismantled the railway steel rails used for short-distance transportation in some factories and mines, as well as the steel rails from the construction sites of completed projects, to meet the urgent need; in addition, wooden rails were vigorously promoted, and the steel rails needed by each power station were solved without national supply. Third, vigorously advocate indigenous methods, promote improved tools, and adopt substitutes. Many power station construction sites are now promoting wooden rails and have made minecarts suitable for wooden rails, which are dozens of times more efficient than manual carrying. Transportation vehicles are far from meeting the needs, so the staff and masses are vigorously promoting the ball bearingization of vehicles; if there are no iron balls, they use wooden or ceramic balls instead.

"Start construction comprehensively, ensure key projects, and complete them in batches" is another important measure for Jiangxi to accelerate the development of the power industry. The key projects among the ten large and medium-sized power stations are the Zhelintan and Jiangkou hydropower stations. These two hydropower stations are required to be partially put into production next year and fully completed the year after. The remaining power stations are actively constructed and completed in batches. The method is: currently, concentrate manpower and material resources to focus on the two key projects, while the remaining eight projects are being constructed, training cadres, and running factories to provide some equipment, materials, and technical force for themselves and for the key power stations. Currently, mechanical factories, steel mills, cement factories, and brick and tile factories are being run at the construction sites of these eight power stations, and some have already begun production. This method not only ensures the progress of key projects but also accelerates the construction speed of general projects.

In order to solve the problems of building roads, erecting power lines, supplying materials, medical and health, and migrant worker dormitories on the construction sites in a cost-effective and efficient manner, each power station has adopted the method of "contracting out," with various departments of the province or special zones/counties where the power stations are located respectively undertaking the construction tasks of the construction sites. For example, the road construction, telephone installation, and medical and health work of the Wan'an and Zhelintan hydropower stations are contracted by the relevant departments of the special zones where they are located, the service industries of the construction sites are contracted by the commercial departments of the counties where they are located, and the migrant worker dormitories are provided by the local people. This is the specific implementation of the policy of "relying on the masses and running electricity by the whole people," which can save the power stations a lot of manpower and material resources and speed up project construction.

In terms of solving technical strength, the measures taken in Jiangxi are: First, the province and special zones respectively run short-term training courses; Second, train locally, taking the construction site as a school and the project as teaching material; Third, organize teachers and students of schools to work and study diligently.

The construction of small power stations throughout Jiangxi Province is also progressing rapidly. Many difficulties in construction have been creatively overcome by the broad masses. In the absence of power generation equipment, Ganzhou, Shangrao and other places have successfully trial-produced generators and water turbines using indigenous methods; in the face of difficulties in raw materials, many places have created wooden distribution panels and wooden pulleys, and have also successfully replaced silicon steel sheets with thin iron sheets.

    大中小结合　小土群起家
    江西撒布强大电网
    本报讯　江西省十个大中型水电站和火电站最近先后开工，全省数百座小型电站也在加紧兴建。为了保证钢铁、机械的大跃进，江西省党政领导部门和广大人民决心克服一切困难，在江西的上空布上电网。
    最近开工的这十个电站五个是大型水电站，即赣江万安、修河柘林、饶河樟树坑、抚河洪门和袁河江口水电站；五个中型的是南昌、萍乡等火电站。这十个装机容量共达三百万瓩的电站，明年即可部分投入生产，再加上今年要建成的上千个小型电站，全省很快就可初步形成一个强大的电网。
    江西省发展电力工业的条件相当差。例如，仅是建设柘林水电站，就需要钢筋二千五百吨，水泥一万五千吨，钢轨二百五十吨，技术人员三千名。但是，全省现在一根钢轨也没有，技术人员仅有一千多名，既不能满足一个工程的需要，更不用说满足十个工程的要求了。在这种情况下，是等待条件成熟呢，还是积极创造条件立即上马？江西省采取了后一条道路。中共江西省委、江西省人民委员会曾经数次开会讨论这个问题，省委肯定了这样两条：一、干劲出条件，干劲足可以创造出充分的条件；二、先行官必须先行，为元帅开路，而不能等待钢铁、机械两大元帅为先行官提供出充分的器材和设备然后再上马。
    在这样一种积极主动的思想指导下，江西省党政领导部门依靠群众，想尽一切办法克服困难，创造条件，力争电力工业高速度发展。
    在解决施工器材和机械设备问题方面，江西一个总的口号是：“多想办法少开口”。这就是说，多自己想办法，少开口向上边要。省委认为，几个大型电站应该有国家的支援和各兄弟省区的协助，但是更应该依靠群众自力更生。为此，省委采取了以下几个措施：一、积极试制和组织生产。低、高标号水泥，钢筋，部分发电设备，都安排在本省制造。现在，低、高标号水泥已经在许多县烧制成功；据粗略的统计，今年即可生产水泥三万吨，明年这些工程所需水泥基本上可以自己解决。一千瓩的巨型发电机、五吨重的起重机，也在一些小厂内试制成功了。二、“以小服大”、“以缓济急”。电站工地运输需要大量钢轨，各地便把若干厂矿短途运输用的铁路钢轨和已竣工的工程工地的钢轨拆来应急；再加上大力推广木轨，各电站需要的钢轨不用国家供应就解决了。三、大倡土办法，推广改良工具，采用代用品。现在许多电站工地都推行了木轨，并且制成了适于木轨用的斗车，运输效率比肩挑高数十倍。运输汽车远不能满足需要，职工群众就大搞车辆滚珠轴承化；铁的滚珠没有，就用木质、瓷质滚珠代替。
    “全面开工，保证重点，分批建成”，是江西加速发展电力工业的另一重要措施。十个大中型电站的重点是柘林和江口两个水电站。这两个水电站要求明年部分投入生产，后年全部建成。其余电站积极施工，分批完成。作法是：当前集中人力、物力突击两个工程重点，其余八个工程一边施工，一边培养干部，一边大办工厂，为自己并为重点电站提供一部分器材、设备和技术力量。现在，这八个电站工地已经在办机械厂、钢铁厂、水泥厂和砖瓦厂，有的已经开始生产。这种办法既保证了重点工程的进度，又加快了一般工程的建设速度。
    为了多快好省地解决工地上修建公路、架设电线、供应物资、医疗卫生、民工宿舍等问题，各电站采取了“包出去”的办法，由省或电站所在地专区、县的各部门分别承担工地的建设任务。如万安、柘林水电站的公路建设、电话架设、医疗卫生工作是由所在地专区有关部门包下来的，工地服务行业是由所在县商业部门包下来的，民工宿舍是当地群众让给的。这是“依靠群众，全民办电”方针的具体贯彻，这样可以节省电站大批人力物力，加快工程建设。
    在解决技术力量方面，江西采取的办法是：一、省和专区分别开办短期训练班；二、就地培养，以工地为学校，以工程为教材；三、组织学校师生勤工俭学。
    江西全省小型电站的建设进展也很快。建设中的许多困难，都被广大群众创造性地克服了。没有发电设备，赣南、上饶等地用土办法试制成功了发电机和水轮机；原材料困难，许多地方创造了木制配电盘、木制皮带轮，还用薄铁板成功地代替了矽钢片。（附图片）
