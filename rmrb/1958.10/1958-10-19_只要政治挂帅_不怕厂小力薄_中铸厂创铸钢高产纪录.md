Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 18th: In the steel casting industry, which has always been considered a "low-yield crop," the Shanghai Joint State-Private Zhongzhu Steel and Iron Factory has raised a red flag of high production. The factory's steel casting output in September averaged 1.93 tons per square meter of molding area, and the average output per molding worker reached 17.59 tons, far exceeding the production levels of steel casting factories across the country. At the National Steel Casting Conference, which closed on the 16th, the First Ministry of Machine Building and all the representatives of the Steel Casting Conference presented a banner to the factory to congratulate them. The workers of Zhongzhu Factory proposed to the conference that they strive to increase the unit molding area output to 2.5 tons by the end of the year.

The Zhongzhu Steel and Iron Factory was originally a factory for casting steel ingots and has only been producing steel castings for just over two years. The factory building is small, the equipment is poor, the site is tight, most of the operations rely on manual labor, and there is not a single engineer in the entire factory. In the first half of this year, the level reached by the factory in several major production indicators was similar to that of steel casting factories in various places, and in July it fell behind other factories. Starting in August, the entire factory worked together, striving for improvement, and suddenly increased the unit molding area output from 0.704 tons in July to 1.6 tons, and the average output of molding workers also jumped from 6.37 tons to 14.35 tons. In September, they reached a higher peak.

The Party organization and administration of Zhongzhu Factory recently comprehensively summarized their high-yield experience. The most important part of the experience is that they constantly educate workers to treat labor with a communist attitude, not caring about personal gains and losses; and rely on the masses to carry out resolute struggles against conservative ideas that hinder the leap forward in production. On this basis, a comprehensive and in-depth technical revolution was launched. The Party branch secretary of a factory in Dalian said after visiting: "The high-yield red flag of Zhongzhu Factory is the crystallization of politics taking command and technical revolution."

Constant political and ideological work has made every worker understand the meaning of labor, and everyone feels glory for the collective and shame for the individual. In the past, some workers in the factory's molding workshop had a relatively strong economic concept and a weak political atmosphere, and production could not be improved. Some young workers even feigned illness and asked for leave to work in other factories in order to get higher wages. In response to this problem, the factory's Party branch launched a "for whom do we work" debate and organized everyone to visit advanced state-owned factories. When they saw that the output of certain castings in state-owned factories was three or four times higher than that of their own factory, and the workers were still suggesting that the leaders increase the quota and actively proposing to abolish the piece-rate wage system, the workers were very moved. Back in the factory, they all said: people are doing everything possible to create wealth for the country, but we are asking for piece-rate wages to ask the country for more money. Is this not the true color of our working class? After the visit and debate, the workers' awareness was greatly improved, and the young workers no longer mentioned increasing wages or transferring jobs. The entire molding workshop was full of energy, and production was greatly improved. In the past, molten steel was waiting for them to mold, but now the molten steel could not be supplied.

When the workers were mobilized, they repeatedly asked to increase the output of steel castings. At this time, the thinking of the cadres could not keep up. At the beginning of September, the workers in the molding workshop proposed to increase the output of steel castings per person per day from about half a ton to one ton. Some cadres said: the conditions in terms of factory buildings, equipment, and sites are not as good as those of large factories, but the output is higher than theirs. Production has reached its peak. The Party branch supported the workers' opinions and decided to have leaders and section cadres go to the workshop to cultivate experimental plots and work shifts. The cadres went to the workshop and came into contact with production, which changed their conservative mood.

After the workers and cadres planted red flags in their minds, the technical revolution was vigorously launched. The workers worked hard day and night. In the transformation of equipment, they designed themselves, found raw materials themselves, processed themselves, and sought cooperation from other factories. Some time ago, the factory's traveling crane was not enough, and the workers made their own, spending very little money, and actually built a traveling crane that could lift three tons of castings. People's minds were liberated, and they became bolder and bolder. For the past two years, the workers in the molding workshop have only dared to use the advanced experience of "sodium silicate quick-drying sand" on small castings. In August and September, when they cast a batch of large castings for rolling mills and converters, they successfully used sodium silicate on large parts for the first time. Now, the factory has 100% adopted this advanced experience in modeling.

### 只要政治挂帅　不怕厂小力薄  中铸厂创铸钢高产纪录

    只要政治挂帅　不怕厂小力薄
    中铸厂创铸钢高产纪录
    新华社上海18日电　在一向被认为是“低产作物”的铸钢行业中，上海公私合营中铸钢铁厂举起了一面高产红旗。这个厂9月份铸钢产量，平均每平方公尺造型面积达到一点九三吨，平均每个造型工人的产量达到十七点五九吨，远远超过了全国各地铸钢厂的生产水平。在16日闭幕的全国铸钢会议上，第一机械工业部和全体铸钢会议代表把一面锦旗送给了这个厂，向他们祝贺。中铸厂的职工向大会提出，争取在年底以前，把单位造型面积产量提高到二点五吨。
    中铸钢铁厂原来是浇铸钢锭的工厂，生产铸钢才只有两年多的时间。厂房小、设备差、场地紧，大部分操作依靠手工，全厂没有一个工程师。今年上半年，这个厂在几个主要生产指标方面所达到的水平和各地的铸钢工厂相差无几，7月份还落在别的工厂后面。从8月份开始，全厂上下一齐动手，发奋图强，一下子把单位造型面积产量从7月份的零点七零四吨提高到一点六吨，造型工人的平均产量也从六点三七吨跃进到十四点三五吨。9月份，他们登上了更高峰。
    中铸厂的党组织和行政最近全面总结了他们的高产经验。经验中最主要的一条，是他们不断教育工人以共产主义的态度来对待劳动，不计较个人得失；对阻碍生产跃进的保守思想，依靠群众进行坚决的斗争。在这个基础上全面深入地展开技术革命。大连有一个厂的党支部书记参观后说：“中铸厂的高产红旗是政治挂帅和技术革命的结晶。”
    经常不断的政治思想工作，使每个工人都懂得了劳动意义，人人都感到为集体光荣，为个人可耻。这个厂的造型车间过去有些工人经济观念比较重，政治空气不浓，生产提不高。有些青年工人为了工资的高低，甚至装病请假，要求调到别的厂去工作。工厂党支部针对这个问题，一面发动群众展开一场“为谁劳动”的大辩论，一面组织大家到先进的国营厂去参观。当他们看到国营厂某些铸件产量比自己厂高三、四倍，而工人还在建议领导提高定额、主动提出取消计件工资制时，工人们非常感动，回到厂里都说：人家都在千方百计为国家创造财富，我们反而要求计件工资，向国家多要钱，这不是我们工人阶级的本色。参观辩论以后，工人觉悟大大提高，青年工人们也不再提加工资、调工作的事情了，整个造型车间人人精神焕发，产量大大提高。过去是钢水等着他们造型，现在钢水反而供应不上。
    工人发动起来了，一次又一次的要求提高铸钢产量。这个时候，干部们的思想跟不上了。9月初造型车间工人提出要把每人每天铸钢件产量从平时半吨左右提高到一吨。有的干部就说：厂房、设备、场地各方面条件都比不上大厂，产量反比他们高，生产已经到顶了。党支部支持了工人的意见，决定要领导人员和科室干部到车间去种试验田和跟班劳动。干部下到车间亲自接触了生产，也就改变了他们的保守情绪。
    工人和干部在思想上插上红旗以后，技术革命蓬蓬勃勃的展开了。工人们夜以继日地苦干苦战。在改造设备中自己设计、自己找原料、自己加工、自己去找外厂协作。前些日子，厂里行车不够用，工人们自己动手，只花了很少一笔钱，居然造出了一台能吊三吨铸件的行车。人们的思想解放了，胆子也越来越大。造型车间工人两年来，一直只敢把“水玻璃快干型砂”的先进经验用在小铸件上，8、9两个月，他们在浇铸一批轧钢机、转炉上的大铸件时，第一次在大件上采用水玻璃获得成功。现在，全厂造型已经百分之百地采用了这一先进经验。
