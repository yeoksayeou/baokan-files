Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 21st - Amman dispatch: Facing strong condemnation from world public opinion, British invading forces began withdrawing from Jordan on the 20th.

    A small contingent of soldiers from the 33rd Light Parachute Regiment of the Royal Artillery boarded a tank landing ship at the port of Aqaba in southern Jordan on the 20th and departed Jordan for Cyprus. According to a British military spokesman, troops will be shipped to Cyprus every day in the coming days.

    Meanwhile, at the airport in the Jordanian capital, soldiers of the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade of the British invading forces are dismantling tents. According to a British military spokesman, these troops will be airlifted out of Jordan on the 25th under United Nations supervision and stationed in Cyprus.

    According to the Damascus newspaper "Al-Bina," citing news from Amman on the 20th, some British officers will remain in Jordan after the British troops withdraw. These officers will be renamed "experts" at the Jordanian Army Headquarters. The newspaper pointed out that the Jordanian government signed "contracts" with these British officers to avoid opposition.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 20th - "Al-Ahram" newspaper published a dispatch from Amman today saying that after the withdrawal of British troops from Jordan, a number of British officers will continue to stay in Jordan in the name of "experts" and will be attached to the Jordanian Army Command.

    The newspaper said that the Jordanian government has signed some so-called "contracts" with these British officers in order to prevent UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld from raising any objections, as this action is a violation of the UN's recommendations.

    The newspaper also said that there are reports from Amman that King Hussein is preparing to travel to London at some point before the British troops withdraw in order to observe the situation in Jordan from afar after the British troops withdraw.

    Cairo's "Rose al-Yūsuf" weekly said today that King Hussein of Jordan has ordered the destruction of all important reports and documents related to the political contacts his government has made over the past five years, especially the destruction of all documents that have been carefully entered into special registers. The news said that Hussein took this action because he was worried that an event similar to what happened in Iraq might occur in Jordan.

    英军被迫开始撤离约旦
    开罗报纸揭露留守一批英国军官的阴谋
    新华社大马士革21日电　安曼消息：面对世界舆论的强烈谴责，英国侵略军从20日开始撤出约旦。
    一小股英国皇家炮兵第三十三轻伞兵团的士兵，20日在约旦南部的亚喀巴港登上一艘坦克登陆舰离开约旦，前往塞浦路斯。据英军发言人说，在以后几天中，每天都将有部队坐船前往塞浦路斯。
    同时在约旦首都的机场，英国侵略军的第十六独立伞兵旅的士兵正在拆帐篷。据英军发言人说，这些军队将在联合国的监督下在25日空运出约旦，停在塞浦路斯。
    据大马士革“建设报”20日援引来自安曼的消息说，在英军撤退后，仍然将有一些英国军官留在约旦。这些军官将改称为约旦陆军总部的“专家”。报纸指出，约旦政府同这些英国军官签订了“合同”，以免遭到反对。
    新华社开罗20日电　“金字塔报”今天刊载的安曼消息说，在英军撤离约旦以后，若干英国军官将以“专家”的名义继续留在约旦，并且将隶属于约旦陆军司令部。
    这家报纸说，约旦政府已经同这些英国军官签订一些所谓“合同”，以便阻止联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出任何反对意见，因为这一行动是违反联合国的建议的。
    这家报纸又说，安曼有消息说，侯赛因国王准备在英军撤离以前的某一个时候前往伦敦，以便从远处来观察英军撤离后的约旦情况。
    开罗“鲁兹·优素福”周刊今天说，约旦国王侯赛因已经下令销毁一切同他的政府过去五年来所进行的政治接触有关的重要报告和文件，特别是销毁那些曾经慎重地列入特别登记簿的一切文件。消息说，侯赛因所以采取这一行动是因为他担心约旦可能发生类似在伊拉克发生过的事件。
