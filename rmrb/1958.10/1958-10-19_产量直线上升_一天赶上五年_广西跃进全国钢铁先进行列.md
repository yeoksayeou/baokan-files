Output Soars, One Day Catches Up to Five Years
Guangxi Leaps into the National Advanced Ranks of Steel
    This newspaper's Nanning dispatch, 18th of this month, reporter Liu Yuanxiu reports: An autonomous region with backward steel production has entered the advanced ranks of national steel production. Up to October 16th this year, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region’s pig iron production has reached 164,558 tons, completing 80.2% of the annual plan, while the total iron production during the entire First Five-Year Plan was only 17,188 tons. Since October, daily pig iron production has risen sharply, and by the 16th, 79.17% of the monthly production plan had been completed. From the 9th to the 16th, the average daily output reached 16,689 tons.
    Now, the entire region is preparing to launch steel "satellites," and a high tide of large-scale mobilization, debate, and collaboration has surged. The labor force投入 dedicated to the steel front in the region has increased from 3.4 million at the end of last month to 4.5 million. More than 57,000 iron-smelting furnaces have been built throughout the region. In Liuzhou Prefecture, where iron production has increased the most, the steel field armies are launching a preparatory work for coal mining, charcoal burning, and ore digging, and combined with production, they are carrying out evaluations and debates to clear ideological obstacles. Although Yulin Prefecture is a iron-deficient area, its daily iron output has remained stable, ranking second in the region in terms of completing the monthly plan. To solve the fuel problem required for launching high-yield iron "satellites," this prefecture organized more than 490,000 people, led by the county party secretaries of each county, to prepare "provisions" for steel in the Liuwanda Mountains and Darong Mountains. In the Yongning and Wuzhou Prefectures, under the slogan of "Catch up with Liuzhou, surpass Yulin," a major inspection of fuel, ore, raw materials, and transportation was launched, requiring the completion of a month's "grain and grass" reserves before the 20th.
    During this period, many areas also launched a mass debate, with the content focusing on whether steel production can make another leap forward in quantity and quality. On the basis of the debate, a movement of contributing ideas from everyone was carried out, and technical reforms of "a great leap forward in quantity and a great improvement in quality" were comprehensively promoted. Now, all regions are vigorously promoting the use of natural wind instead of forced draft in lime kiln-style iron smelting methods, which has caused pig iron production to soar. The experience of Liuzhou City and Xincheng in using the "stir-fried twice-cooked pork" method to refine sintered iron into steel is being prepared for large-scale promotion.
    Currently, the new situation of pig iron production in the autonomous region is only the beginning of a leap forward. A larger-scale "Huaihai Campaign" has been revealed. The combat mission put forward by the Regional Party Committee is: Go all out and strive to basically complete the 200,000-ton pig iron production task assigned by the Central Government in October!

### 产量直线上升  一天赶上五年  广西跃进全国钢铁先进行列

    产量直线上升  一天赶上五年
    广西跃进全国钢铁先进行列
    本报南宁18日电　记者刘远修报道：一个钢铁生产落后的自治区，已进入全国钢铁生产的先进行列。广西僮族自治区今年到10月16日止，生铁产量已达十六万四千五百五十八吨，完成全年计划的80.2％，而第一个五年计划期间铁的总产量才一万七千一百八十八吨。10月以来，生铁日产量直线上升，到16日，已完成全月生产计划的79.17％，从9日到16日，平均日产量达到一万六千六百八十九吨。
    现在，全区都在准备大放钢铁卫星，一个大动员、大辩论、大协作的高潮，已经汹涌澎湃地开展起来。全区投入钢铁战线的劳动力，已由上月底的三百四十万，增加到四百五十万。全区共建成炼铁炉五万七千多座。铁产量增加最多的柳州专区，这几天各钢铁野战大军，正掀起一个采煤、烧炭、挖矿石等大生产前的准备工作，并结合生产开展评比、辩论，扫清了思想障碍。玉林专区虽是一个缺铁地区，但铁的日产量也一直很稳定，占全区完成月计划的第二位。这个专区为解决大放产铁卫星所需的燃料问题，组织了四十九万多人，由各县县委书记领导到六万大山、大容山一带为钢铁准备“粮草”。邕宁、梧州两专区，在“赶柳州、超玉林”的行动口号下，开展燃料、矿石、原材料、运输大检查，要求20日前完成一个月“粮草”储备。
    在这期间，许多地区同时掀起了全民性的大辩论，辩论的内容是：钢铁生产在数量和质量上能不能再跃进，并在辩论的基础上开展了人人献计运动，全面推广“数量大跃进，质量大提高”的技术改革。现在，各地正大力推广利用自然风代替鼓风的石灰窑式炼铁方法，使生铁产量飞跃上升。柳州市和忻城用“炒回锅肉”的办法把烧结铁炼成钢的经验，准备大量推广。
    当前，自治区生铁生产出现的新形势，仅仅是跃进的开始。一个更大规模的“淮海战役”，已经揭晓。区党委提出的战斗任务是：全力以赴，力争10月份基本完成中央分配的二十万吨生铁生产任务！
