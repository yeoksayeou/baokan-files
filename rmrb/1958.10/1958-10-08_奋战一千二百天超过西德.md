    Striving for 1,200 Days to Surpass West Germany
    By our reporter Liu Guiliang
    In the first nine months of this year, industrial production increased by more than 11% compared with the same period last year, and agricultural production achieved a bumper harvest with an increase of 12%. The working people of Democratic Germany are greeting the ninth National Day of Germany's first worker-peasant state with such fruitful results on the production front. They are galloping victoriously on the road of "striving for 1,200 days to surpass West Germany in terms of per capita consumption levels of essential goods".
  The Party's General Line Inspires the Masses
    An important component of the Party's general line put forward by the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party in July – the main economic task – is: "Within a few years, the development of the national economy of the German Democratic Republic will practically prove the superiority of the socialist system. By the end of 1961, the per capita consumption of all major necessities and consumer goods should exceed that of West Germany." In the three months since, after extensive and in-depth discussions by the workers and peasants, this heroic fighting slogan has turned into a huge material force.
    What is clearly different from previous years is that in the months of July, August and September, which are the vacation season for most employees, the industrial production of Democratic Germany not only maintained an excellent record of more than 10% growth compared with the same period last year in terms of total output value, but also completed the state plan targets in terms of product quality and variety. During the same period, West Germany's industrial output value decreased by more than 3%.
    The diverse range of light industrial products of Democratic Germany exhibited at the Leipzig Autumn International Fair not long ago, such as leather shoes, televisions, electric refrigerators, travel equipment, etc., forced even the most fastidious Western journalists to admit their high quality. After the fair, the State Planning Commission of Democratic Germany immediately sent a large number of cadres to enterprises in various places to specifically discuss with the employees how to quickly produce in large quantities the various high-quality and novel-style samples exhibited at the fair. The workers responded to the call from above with a heroic spirit, saying, "As long as the raw materials and process regulations are handed over to us, we can guarantee the production of any new product."
    Today, in terms of industrial consumer goods, Democratic Germany has caught up with West Germany in many aspects in terms of technical level and product quality. The main remaining problem is to catch up with and surpass it in terms of per capita quantity.
    In agriculture, Democratic Germany this year, on the basis of the great leap forward in the agricultural cooperativization movement (at present, the land area of agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 34% of the total cultivated land in the country), the grain harvest increased by 700,000 tons compared with last year (last year's total grain output was more than 5.8 million tons), an increase of 12%. Some areas even exceeded this. For example, the grain output of the Weirnoye District of Bernau County, where the famous "Mao Zedong Tractor Station" is located, increased by 15% compared with last year. This is a bumper harvest rarely seen in many years.
    Many Aspects Have Caught Up With West Germany
    Due to the thriving socialist economy of Democratic Germany and the signs of capitalist economic crisis in West Germany, West Germany has been left behind by Democratic Germany in many aspects in terms of per capita consumption of food and important industrial consumer goods. For example, in terms of food (calculated per person), Democratic Germany has surpassed West Germany in pork—34.9 kg vs. 27.1 kg, butter—11.2 kg vs. 7.2 kg, animal fats—8.3 kg vs. 5.9 kg, white sugar—33.9 kg vs. 28.3 kg, flour—118.5 kg vs. 88.5 kg. Currently, it is still lower than West Germany in beef, poultry, margarine, milk, eggs, fruits, coffee and cocoa. In terms of industrial consumer goods (calculated per thousand people), Democratic Germany has surpassed West Germany in cameras—21 units vs. 16 units, bicycles—22 vehicles vs. 11 vehicles, motorcycles—5 vehicles vs. 1 vehicle. Currently, it is still lower than West Germany in textiles, nylon stockings, leather shoes, clocks and watches, sewing machines, carpets, automobiles, televisions, etc.
    Just by reviewing the changes in the contrast between the people's lives in East and West Germany in recent years (the actual wages of employees in Democratic Germany have been continuously increasing and prices have been continuously decreasing on the basis of increased production, while the prices and cost of living in West Germany have been rising year by year, and the purchasing power of the working people has been continuously decreasing), it can be seen that the broad masses of employees in Democratic Germany are full of confidence in the completion of the combat task of surpassing West Germany in terms of consumption of food and major industrial consumer goods in 1,200 days, and there is a sufficient basis for this.
    According to the provisions of the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the annual growth rate of industrial production is 6.8%, while the growth rate in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period last year has remained above 11%. That is to say, the speed of industrial production growth has almost doubled compared with the country's original plan.
    Political Leadership Can Lead to Leaps Forward
    How did such a leap forward occur?
    The key lies in improving labor productivity. And the key to improving labor productivity lies in the unprecedented increase in the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of employees.
    After the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, Party organizations at all levels tightly grasped political and ideological work, making it the commander in the victorious development of the socialist production competition. Employees in industrial and mining enterprises deeply discussed at various large and small gatherings the ten socialist moral guidelines proposed by Comrade Ulbricht on behalf of the Party Central Committee, such as adhering to internationalist solidarity, loving the motherland, mutual assistance and cooperation, respecting the collective, protecting public property, consolidating labor discipline, etc., which stimulated the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of employees.
    On the basis of the high level of ideological awareness of employees, the movement to promote the working methods of the famous advanced worker Seifert has developed into a movement to generally increase production quotas. Seifert's working method is to tap the potential within working hours, oppose loafing, eliminate the phenomenon of work stoppages and waiting for materials, improve working methods, and improve labor indicators. In the past nine months, in this movement, the industrial production increase target of the Second Five-Year Plan has been raised from 38% to 55%. Specifically, in the last two years of the Second Five-Year Plan alone (1959 and 1960), the result of increasing the industrial production target will be to increase the value of output by 6.1 billion marks compared with the original plan (of which the chemical industry will increase by 1.9 billion, the light industry will increase by 2 billion, and the metal processing industry will increase by 2.2 billion).
    The Youth's Fighting Slogan
    The "Compass Movement" initiated by the Free German Youth League is even more full of revolutionary vigor. Under the slogan of "Advancing Target—Sixty Years!", the Free German Youth League mobilized and organized young people across the country to complete the main economic tasks stipulated by the Party one year ahead of schedule. The 1.7 million members of the league enthusiastically responded to this call, tapping potential and formulating specific struggle goals in their respective grassroots organizations, and setting the compass on one of their compasses to sixty degrees. The young people will take on two grand projects. These two projects are: 1. Building an oil pipeline from the Soviet Union through Poland to Democratic Germany. After this pipeline is completed, Democratic Germany will receive a supply of 4.8 million tons of oil from the Soviet Union every year by 1965. This will greatly promote the huge development of Democratic Germany's future chemical industry. 2. Building a north-south canal connecting the port of Rostock with the Elbe River. After this canal is completed, Democratic Germany's import and export ocean trade will no longer pass through Hamburg in West Germany. This will not only shorten the distance from the inland to the ocean, but will also save the country a lot of foreign exchange.
    On the eve of National Day, good news of the youth "Compass Movement" has been constantly reported. In the third quarter, young socialists have created more than 15 million marks of wealth for the country, done more than 7.5 million hours of voluntary labor in basic construction, and done more than 3.4 million hours of support labor to help farmers with the autumn harvest. In addition, in the production struggle to strive to complete the main economic tasks (surpassing West Germany's consumption level in 1,200 days), 669 new youth shock teams and youth league supervision posts were formed, 2,430 young farmers were mobilized to participate in cooperatives, 17,370 new league members were developed, and 4,715 league members applied to join the Socialist Unity Party.
    Inspiring Prospects
    In the past three months, the broad masses of employees have participated in the discussion and formulation of the country's long-term plan. The employees are full of confidence in the discussion, believing that after fighting for 1,200 days, that is, by the end of 1961, there will be no problem in surpassing the average consumption level of West Germany in terms of food, and the average consumption of major industrial consumer goods will definitely catch up with and surpass West Germany.
    In terms of food, on the basis of increasing exports, the supply of coffee will be increased from 9,400 tons in 1957 to 28,000 tons in 1961, cocoa products will be increased from 20,300 tons to 45,000 tons, tropical fruits will be more than doubled, and the per capita consumption of fish and fish products will increase to 16.4 kg by 1960 and catch up with West Germany.
    The increased production targets for major industrial consumer goods are as follows:
        1957　1961
   Leather shoes	16.5 million pairs	23.5 million pairs
   Woolen fabrics	24.5 million square meters	48.7 million square meters
   Woolen coats	3.2 million pieces	10.1 million pieces
   Cotton cloth	217 million square meters	301 million square meters
   Nylon fabrics	1.6 million square meters	8.4 million square meters
   Carpets	3.9 million square meters	6.5 million square meters
   Televisions	100,000 units	400,000 units
   Electric refrigerators	28,000 units	130,000 units
   Automobiles	21,500 vehicles	68,000 vehicles
    Comrade Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, pointed out that completing the above-mentioned main economic tasks in 1,200 days has profound political significance.
    The resolution of this economic task will not only consolidate the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic and strengthen the strength of the entire socialist camp, but will also further promote the high tide of the mass movement of the people of West Germany against the Bonn atomic armaments policy.

### 奋战一千二百天超过西德

    奋战一千二百天超过西德
    本报记者　刘桂梁
    今年头九个月工业生产比去年同期增加11％以上，农业生产获得了增产12％的大丰收。民主德国的劳动人民是以生产战线上这样丰硕的成果迎接德国历史上第一个工农国家的第九届国庆节的。他们正在“奋战一千二百天，在按人口计算的消费水平方面超过西德”的道路上快马加鞭地胜利前进。
  党的总路线鼓舞了群众
    今年7月间德国统一社会党第五次代表大会提出的党的总路线中一个重要组成部分——主要经济任务是：“在几年内使德意志民主共和国国民经济的发展实际证明社会主义制度的优越性。到1961年底要在所有主要生活资料和消费品的每人平均消费量方面超过西德”。三个月来，经过工农群众的广泛而深入的讨论，这个充满英雄气概的战斗口号已经变成了巨大的物质力量。
    同往年显然不同的是，在作为大多数职工渡假季节的7、8、9三个月份里民主德国的工业生产不但在总产值方面一直保持着比去年同期增长10％以上的优异成绩，而且在产品的质量和品种方面也都完成了国家计划的指标。而在同一时期，西德工业产值却下降3％多。
    不久以前在来比锡秋季国际博览会上展出的民主德国的多种多样轻工业产品，例如皮鞋、电视机、电气冰箱、旅行器材等，使善于吹毛求疵的西方记者们也不得不承认它们的质量之高。博览会过后，民主德国国家计划委员会立刻派了大批干部深入到各地企业里去，同职工们具体商量如何使博览会展出的质量高、样式新颖的各种样品迅速地大批生产出来。工人们以豪迈的精神响应上级的号召，说“只要把原材料和工艺规程交给我们，就能保证生产出任何新产品来。”
    今天，在工业消费品方面就技术水平和产品质量来说，民主德国已在许多方面赶上了西德，剩下的主要问题是要在按人口平均的数量方面赶上和超过它。
    在农业方面，民主德国今年在农业合作化运动大踏步前进的基础上（目前农业生产合作社土地面积已占全国耕地总面积的34％），谷物收获量比去年增产七十万吨（去年谷物总产量是五百八十多万吨），即增加12％。有些地区甚至比这还要多。例如著名的“毛泽东拖拉机站”所在地的贝尔瑙县魏尔诺耶琛区的谷物产量比去年增加了15％。这是多少年来少有的大丰收。
    许多方面已赶上西德
    由于民主德国的社会主义经济欣欣向荣和西德的资本主义经济危机迹象丛生，在食品和重要工业消费品按人口平均的消费量方面，西德已在很多方面被民主德国抛在后面。例如在食品方面（按每人计算）民主德国已超过西德的有猪肉—34.9公斤比27.1公斤、黄油—11.2公斤比7.2公斤、动物油脂—8.3公斤比5.9公斤、白糖—33.9公斤比28.3公斤、面粉—118.5公斤比88.5公斤，目前尚低于西德的是牛肉、家禽、人造黄油、牛奶、鸡蛋、水果、咖啡和可可。在工业消费品方面（按每千人计算）民主德国已超过西德的有：照相机—21部比16部、自行车—22辆比11辆、摩托车—五辆比一辆。目前尚低于西德的是纺织品、尼龙女袜、皮鞋、钟表、缝纫机、地毯、小汽车、电视机等。
    只要回顾一下几年来东西德人民生活对比的变化（民主德国在增产基础上职工的实际工资不断提高、物价不断下降，而西德的物价和生活指数逐年上涨，劳动人民购买力不断降低），就可以看出：民主德国广大职工对于在一千二百天内在食品和主要工业消费品的消费量方面超过西德的这个战斗任务的完成满怀信心，是有充分根据的。
    按照第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）的规定，每年工业生产的增长率是6.8％，而今年头九个月比去年同期的增长率一直保持在11％以上。也就是说工业生产增长的速度比国家的原定计划几乎加快了一倍。
    政治挂帅就能跃进
    这样一个跃进是怎样产生的呢？
    关键在于劳动生产率的提高。而提高劳动生产率的关键又在于广大职工社会主义觉悟的空前高涨。
    德国统一社会党第五次代表大会以后，党的各级组织紧紧地抓住了政治思想工作，使它成为胜利开展社会主义生产竞赛的统帅。工矿企业职工在各种大小集会上深入地讨论了乌布利希同志代表党中央提出的十项社会主义道德准则，如坚持国际主义团结、热爱祖国、互助合作、尊重集体、保护全民财产、巩固劳动纪律等，激发了广大职工的社会主义觉悟。
    在职工思想觉悟高涨的基础上，推广著名的先进工人塞弗特工作方法的运动，已发展成为普遍提高生产定额的运动。塞弗特的工作方法就是挖掘劳动时间内的潜力，反对磨洋工，消除停工待料的现象，改善工作方法，提高劳动指标。九个月来，在这个运动中第二个五年计划的工业增产指标已从38％重新提高到55％。具体说来，只第二个五年计划的最后两年（1959和1960年），工业生产指标提高的结果就将使增产的产值比原计划增加六十一亿马克（其中化学工业增加十九亿，轻工业增加二十亿，金属加工工业增加二十二亿）。
    青年的战斗口号
    自由德国青年联盟发起的“指南针运动”，更是充满了革命的朝气。自由德国青年联盟在“前进目标——六零年！”的口号下，动员和组织全国青年提前一年完成党所规定的主要经济任务。全国一百七十万盟员热烈响应这一号召，都在自己所属的基层组织里挖掘潜力，制定具体奋斗目标，把自己的一个罗盘上的指南针拨向六十度。青年们将把两项宏伟的工程担当起来。这两项工程是：一、建筑一条从苏联经过波兰通到民主德国的油管，这条油管建成后，到1965年民主德国将每年从苏联得到石油四百八十万吨的供应。这样将大大促进民主德国未来化学工业的巨大发展。二、建筑一条把罗斯托克海港同易北河连结起来的南北运河，这条运河建成后，将使民主德国的进口和出口的远洋贸易不再经过西德的汉堡。这样不但从内陆到海洋的距离将会缩短，而且将使国家节约大量外汇。
    在国庆节前夕，不断传来了青年“指南针运动”的捷报。青年社会主义者们已在第三季度中为国家创造了一千五百多万马克的财富，在基本建设中做了七百五十多万小时的义务劳动，并为帮助农民秋收做了三百四十多万小时的支援劳动。此外在争取完成主要经济任务（一千二百天内超过西德消费水平）的生产斗争中，组成了六百六十九个新的青年突击队和青年联盟监督岗，动员了二千四百三十个青年农民参加合作社，发展了一万七千三百七十个新盟员，而且有四千七百一十五名盟员申请加入统一社会党。
    振奋人心的前景
    三个月来广大职工参加了国家远景计划的讨论和制订。职工们在讨论中满怀信心地认为，在奋战一千二百天以后，即到1961年年底时，不仅在食品方面超过西德的平均消费水平毫无问题，而且在主要工业消费品的平均消费量方面也将肯定地赶上和超过西德。
    在食品方面，在增加出口的基础上，将使咖啡的供应量由1957年的九千四百吨增加到1961年的二万八千吨，可可制品由二万零三百吨增加到四万五千吨，热带水果将增加一倍以上，鱼和鱼制品的每人平均消费量到1960年就将增加到十六点四公斤而赶上西德。
    主要工业消费品方面增产指标是这样的：
                1957年　1961年
   皮鞋1，650万双　2，350万双
   毛织品　2，450万平方公尺　4，870万平方公尺
   毛料上衣　320万件　1，010万件
   棉布　21，700万平方公尺　30，100万平方公尺
   尼龙料子　160万平方公尺　840万平方公尺
   地毯　390万平方公尺　650万平方公尺
   电视机　100，000部　400，000部
   电气冰箱　28，000个　130，000个
   小汽车　21，500辆　68，000辆
    统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希同志指出，一千二百天内完成上述主要经济任务，具有深刻的政治意义。
    这一经济任务的解决不仅将巩固德意志民主共和国的工农政权，加强整个社会主义阵营的力量，并将进一步推动西德人民反对波恩原子武装政策的群众运动的高潮。
