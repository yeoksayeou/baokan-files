    Hail Our Magnificent Motherland
    ——A Record of the Grand National Day Parade in the Capital
  　·Xinhua News Agency Reporter·
    On October 1st, six hundred thousand people in the capital celebrated the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the great victory of the Party's socialist general line in Tiananmen Square, using the great achievements of socialist construction.
  We Must Secure 10.7 Million Tons
    The golden characters "We must secure 10.7 million tons of steel" were the mighty "military flag" of the "Steel Marshals" in today's parade. When the parading people carried models of converters, electric furnaces, blast furnaces, and groups of indigenous blast furnaces into the square, the square immediately erupted.
    Then, a group of silver-gray indigenous blast furnace models appeared in the metallurgical industry parade, in front of which was a "Flying Dragon" with the words: 700,000 small and indigenous blast furnaces have been built nationwide. The parade also circulated newly distributed red bulletins: On September 29, the national daily steel production was nearly 60,000 tons, and the daily pig iron production was nearly 300,000 tons. Compared with the average daily output in August: steel increased by 165%, and iron increased by 1020%.
    Chairman Mao frequently waved to the marching steel army from the city tower. Tiananmen Square was very lively.
    Comrade Chervenkov, after seeing the indigenous blast furnace model, said to Comrade Liu Shaoqi: "It is truly an incredible speed that you can produce so many tons of steel in one day." Comrade Liu Shaoqi said, "This is the result of organizing 600 million people to give play to their initiative and creativity." Comrade Chervenkov then said, "At this speed, it seems that it will not take fifteen years to catch up with and surpass England." Comrade Liu Shaoqi replied, "It can be greatly shortened."
    Here Shows the Power
  of the Socialist Camp
    The marching crowd shouted: "Mobilize the whole people to ensure that steel production doubles!" As they walked, people looked up at the rostrum of Tiananmen Square. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" shook the square. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed to the indigenous blast furnaces in the square and said to Comrade Li Zhouyuan: "We produce so much iron mainly by relying on these indigenous furnaces." Comrade Li Zhouyuan nodded repeatedly. At the same time, Comrade Baluku excitedly said to Comrade Zhu De: "This scene is truly magnificent. From here, we can see the power of our socialist camp." Comrade Zhu De said, "The countries of our socialist camp are becoming stronger day by day."
    The mighty steel contingent continued to move forward. Here were the employees of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the steelworkers of the newly built and expanded Beijing Special Steel Plant and Beijing Steel Plant, as well as soldiers from schools, government agencies, rural areas, and other non-steel factories who were smelting steel and iron.
    Following in the footsteps of the "Steel Marshals," the "Mechanical Marshals" came to the square. Many huge machine tool models marked that China's machine industry had entered a new stage of manufacturing heavy, precision, and automated machinery. Here were the Ding Er Er Ba spiral bevel gear milling machine, the eight-meter gantry planer, the 25,000-kilowatt turbine, and the electronic computer. The roar of motors resounded through the square, and many large and small cars and tractors of various colors such as black, dark gray, milky white, and sky blue drove past.
    The two "pioneer officers," electricity and transportation, who paved the way for the "marshals," followed one after another. Countless charts floating in the crowd brought exciting good news: on the 28th, millions of railway workers and the masses along the railway lines released a large "satellite" of 52,000 loaded wagons per day, which is a miracle in China's railway transportation. By the end of this year, the power generation capacity of China's power industry will reach more than 6 million kilowatts, which is more than twice the sum of all power generation capacity since China had electricity in 1882 before liberation.
    Many factory buildings and tall building models appeared in the square. The construction workers of the capital are participating in the parade today with a very proud mood. They will use their own hands to spread factories throughout the suburbs of the capital, make rows of buildings stand on both sides of East and West Chang'an Avenue, and make Tiananmen Square more beautiful and magnificent to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.
    Thousand-Jin Townships, Ten-Thousand-Jin Communes,
  Spread All Over China
    The vivid scenes of peasants celebrating the harvest and the communization of the people appeared in Tiananmen Square. Elderly commune members played harvest music with sheng, xiao, guan, and di, young men danced the harvest dance with wheat ears, and women joyfully sang the song "Thousand-Jin Townships Appear All Over China." In a burst of jubilation, a group of balloons suddenly flew up, carrying huge banners into the sky:
    "The Grain Marshal is Encamped, Output Leaps One Fold."
    "The Total Wheat Output is 80 Billion Jin, Surpassing the United States."
    "Cotton Output Doubles, Ranking First in the World."
    At this time, the foreign guests on the viewing platform and the crowd in the square applauded with thunderous applause, cheering the unprecedented harvest of China's agricultural production in the Great Leap Forward.
    Members of the Yongledian People's Commune participated in the parade, holding high rice ears. Female commune member Zhang Guifang could not help but throw a bunch of rice ears into the sky, and she shouted loudly: "Chairman Mao, please take a look at the high-yield late rice we created." The five sisters and eighteen heroes who became famous in the Tongzhou District for deep plowing the land, today carried deep digging shovels, beat bamboo clappers, and excitedly sang labor songs in the crowd: "Deep plow wheat fields one and a half feet deep, apply 200,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, the wheat production target is 8,000 jin per mu, strive to break through the 10,000 jin mark, to realize communism as soon as possible."
    People's commune members carried five large red characters "The People's Commune is Good" and passed through Tiananmen Square. A chart told people: the number of peasant households participating in communes nationwide has accounted for 90.4% of the total number of peasant households. In this giant parade, there were factories, indigenous blast furnaces, and tall models symbolizing agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production. Yin Yinlan, a female peasant who became a lathe worker just a few months ago, participated in the parade for the first time today, holding a hammer with the red characters "First Generation Worker."
  Everyone a Soldier, Invaders Cannot Move an Inch
    The band played the marching music again, and the militia队伍 came over. These militiamen, armed in the angry tide against American aggressors, were all in high spirits, strong-willed, carrying long guns on their shoulders, holding submachine guns in their hands, wearing bullet belts around their waists, and marching forward with neat and majestic steps. At this time, the entire Tiananmen Square was sensational.
    Today, the representatives of the capital's militia are being reviewed—seven divisions of workers, peasants, cadres, and students, who passed through Tiananmen Square in twenty-one formations. Although their training time was very short, their formations and steps were no less than those of regular troops. Worker militiamen wearing black work clothes and willow safety helmets walked at the forefront. Following closely were farmer militiamen with white towels tied around their heads, student militiamen in white tops and blue trousers, and cadre militiamen in ordinary clothes. Many female militiamen with black and red faces walked valiantly in the ranks of cadre and student militiamen, and the entire audience repeatedly applauded and cheered for these armed female soldiers.
    "How long have they been organized?" Comrade Chervenkov, who was watching intently, asked Chairman Mao.
    Chairman Mao smiled and told the distinguished guests: "It's been less than a month!"
    Chairman Mao also told him: "Beijing already has fifty militia divisions, and the militia in various parts of the country has been organized in a very short time. By participating in military training in the militia, people's bodies will quickly get better, workers and peasants will produce better, students will study better, and cadres will also work better." Chairman Mao added: "This is a military organization, a labor organization, an educational organization, and a sports organization."
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi also told Comrade Chervenkov: "There are soldiers everywhere, making it impossible for invaders to move an inch."
    In this contingent, there are vanguards who fight day and night on the steel front, as well as descendants of "February 7th" old workers. The "Jiulan Group," which is famous at home and abroad for winning collective honors in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, has also been armed. These girls with tanned faces and many other female militiamen marched forward valiantly in formation.
    The armed peasant team from the construction site of the Miyun Reservoir, the largest water conservancy project in North China, was led by Su Guoliang, a veteran guerrilla captain who pioneered tunnel warfare and mine warfare during the War of Resistance Against Japan, to accept the review. This battle-tested old hero, in 1946, led more than 100 militiamen in Anping Town, Xianghe County, and repelled more than 300 American bandits with modern equipment who invaded the liberated area, killing and wounding 14 enemies. Before forming the team, he said to his soldiers: We have the experience of eliminating Japanese devils, and we also have the experience of eliminating American bandits. If American aggressors dare to impose war on us, we will bury them in the Taiwan Strait. In this brave militia队伍, there are many children of old militiamen and old guerrillas. Wang Peiguang, a 24-year-old peasant whose grandfather was a veteran Red Army soldier and his father was a guerrilla, said to his comrades beside him before the review today: If American bandits dare to invade us, I will bravely fire at the enemy like my grandfather and father.
    A scene not seen in previous years appeared in the parade: there were many students in the worker-peasant ranks, and there were many workers and peasants in the student ranks. The peasants of Haidian District, who had just become a literacy-free zone before National Day, carried a large rocket model today, on which was written their new goal of marching towards culture.
    For the first time today, students from various universities and colleges participated in the parade with models and charts of their own labor production and scientific research achievements. On these charts it was written: Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration found iron ore with reserves of 15 billion tons in two months; teachers and students of Peking University worked hard for 40 days and achieved 4,139 scientific research results, exceeding the total number of research projects in the past 20 years; teachers and students of Beijing Normal University who went to the mountains, went to the countryside, and went to factories to participate in production labor reached 100,000 working days. In the队伍 of Tsinghua University, there was a group of students from the school-run factory, wearing work clothes and welding masks. Their faces were all black and red, and they repeatedly raised the shovels, hammers, iron bars and other production tools in their hands, shouting the slogan "Education serves politics, education is combined with productive labor!" and passed through Tiananmen Square. And a part of the students of Beijing Agricultural University today walked together with the farmers of the Wanshoushan People's Commune in the suburbs.
    Scientific Workers and
  Working People Move Forward Hand in Hand
    In the parade队伍 of scientific workers in the capital, there was a striking chart, which wrote about the distribution of mass scientific research队伍 in the vast rural areas and towns across the country, indicating that scientific research work has broken through the circle of a few experts and scholars, and the vast number of workers have entered the队伍 of science and technology.
    A group of scientific workers discovered Zhang Guangyi, a peasant from Henan Province who created new tools for farmland water conservancy, and Tian Zhenxiang, a worker who first created the silicon steel sheet for converter steelmaking, before the parade. Tian Zhenxiang participated in the parade队伍 of scientific workers for the first time today. He was recently elected as a national member of the China Association for Science and Technology. Today, when he walked to Tiananmen Square, he kept waving bouquets and shouting shoulder to shoulder with a group of young scientific workers: "Guarantee to achieve the Twelve-Year Scientific Research Plan five years ahead of schedule!" "Create new steel records, and present gifts to the tenth anniversary of National Day!"
  Literary and Art Warriors Sing for the Great Harvest,
  Sing for Communization
    The sound of deafening drums and cymbals and the high-pitched suona sounded in the square. The literary and art队伍 composed of 8,000 people, colorful and blooming, passed through the square, singing and dancing to the moving melody of the "Leap Forward Ode" played by a wind instrument band composed of peasants. Members of the amateur song and dance troupes from Zunhua and Fengrun counties and Beijing mass cultural activists performed "Harvest Dance" and "People's Commune Joyful Yangko." At this time, only golden "wheat waves" were seen rolling in the wind in the square, snow-white cotton bolls were flying up and down, and "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers" waving colorful silk were all smiling.
    Among the 15,000-strong sports army, there are many athletes, sports champions, and creators of new records. In the National Defense Sports Brigade, there are shooting, radio, navigation, aviation, glider, and motorcycle sports teams. Under the call of "combining labor and martial arts, everyone is a soldier," national defense sports athletes are studying hard and practicing hard to strengthen national defense and safeguard peace, and improve special military skills.
    Also participating in today's parade were members of handicraft production cooperatives, Young Pioneers, industrialists and merchants, citizens, and religious circles.
    The parading people kept shouting: "Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Support the Arab national independence movement!" "Support the national independence movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America!" "The US-British aggressor troops immediately get out of Lebanon and Jordan!"
    Foreign guests on the viewing platform enthusiastically waved their handkerchiefs and hats to greet the parading people. They quickly recorded the scenes of the parade with cameras and some with brushes. The Chinese translators accompanying them were too busy to answer the various questions raised by the guests.
    Mahmoud, the head of the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation to China, said that he saw the brand-new spiritual outlook of the Chinese people and the great achievements in construction today. He said that China's victory is the victory of the Arab people. Chalar, a student representative from Algeria who participated in the International Student Union Congress, said excitedly that China's support for our Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria has given us the greatest encouragement. Hernando Garavito Muñoz, a professor at the Free University of Colombia, said: "If the US imperialists ignore the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and dare to continue to invade the People's Republic of China, they will definitely fail completely."
    The parade ended at 2:10 pm. The crowd in the square surged towards Tiananmen Square like a tide, cheering and paying tribute to Chairman Mao and other party and state leaders. At this time, countless colorful balloons and fireworks flew into the sky, and the entire Tiananmen Square was filled with cheers. People who have created earth-shattering achievements in the Great Leap Forward are enjoying the joy and glory of the festival. People cheer for this great era of "one day equals twenty years," cheer for our magnificent motherland, cheer for our victorious organizer – the great Communist Party of China, cheer for our boundless leader, cheer for our generation of heroic and bold people, whom the children and grandchildren of thousands of years will always be proud of.

    欢呼我们气象万千的祖国
    ——记首都国庆节大游行的盛况
  　·新华社记者·
    首都六十万人民，在10月1日用社会主义建设的巨大成就，在天安门广场欢庆中华人民共和国成立九周年，欢庆党的社会主义总路线的伟大胜利。
  一定拿下1070万吨
    一定要拿下一○七○万吨钢的金色大字，是今天游行行列中“钢铁元帅”的威武的“军旗”。当游行的人们抬着转炉、电炉、高炉和成群的土高炉模型走进广场时，广场上立刻沸腾起来。
    接着冶金工业部游行队伍中又出现了一群银灰色的土高炉模型，在这个土高炉群前面的是一个“飞龙”，上面写着：全国已建起小高炉、土高炉七十万座。游行队伍还传阅着刚刚散发的红色喜报、9月29日，全国日产钢近六万吨，日产生铁近三十万吨。和8月份的平均日产量相比：钢增加了百分之一百六十五，铁增加了百分之一千零二十。
    毛主席在城楼上频频向游行的钢铁军招手。天安门城楼上十分活跃。
    契尔文科夫同志看了土高炉模型对刘少奇同志说：“你们一天能生产这么多吨钢铁，真是了不起的速度。”刘少奇同志说：“这是六亿人民组织起来发挥积极性创造性的结果。”契尔文科夫同志又说：“按这个速度，赶上和超过英国看来用不了十五年。”刘少奇同志回答说：“可以大大缩短。”
    这里显示出了
  社会主义阵营的威力
    游行的人群高呼：“全民动员，保证钢铁翻一番！”人们一边走，一边望着天安门城楼主席台。“毛主席万岁”的口号声震动着广场。周恩来同志指着广场上的土高炉向李周渊同志说：“我们生产那么多铁，主要靠这些土炉子。”李周渊同志连连点头。在这同时，巴卢库同志兴奋地对朱德同志说：“这个场面真伟大，从这里可以看到我们社会主义阵营的威力。”朱德同志说：“我们社会主义阵营各国都是一天比一天强大。”
    浩大的钢铁队伍在继续前进。这里有石景山钢铁公司的职工们，有新建和扩建的北京特殊钢厂和北京钢厂的钢铁工人，还有学校、机关、农村和其他非钢铁工厂的炼钢炼铁的战士。
    伴随着“钢铁元帅”的步伐，“机械元帅”走到广场上来。很多巨大的机床模型，标志着我国机械工业已跨入制造重型、精密自动化机械的新阶段。这里有丁二二八螺旋伞齿轮铣床、八米龙门刨、二万五千瓩的汽轮机和电子计算机。广场上响起了轰鸣的马达声，许多黝黑、深灰、乳白、天蓝等颜色的大小汽车和拖拉机走了过来。
    为“元帅”开路的电力和交通运输两个“先行官”相继而上。浮动在人群中的无数图表，给人们带来了激动人心的好消息：全国百万铁路职工和铁路沿线群众在28日放出了日装货车五万二千辆的大“卫星”，这是我国铁路运输上的奇迹。到今年年底，我国电力工业的发电能力将达六百多万瓩以上，它比解放前我国1882年有电以来所有发电能力的总和还多两倍多。
    许多厂房和高大建筑物的模型在广场上出现。首都建筑工人们，今天是以十分自豪的心情来参加游行。他们就要用自己的双手使首都的城郊工厂遍布，使东西长安街两旁楼房林立，使天安门广场更加美丽壮观，迎接国庆十周年。千斤乡，万斤社，
  遍布全中国
    农民们欢庆丰收和人民公社化的生动情景出现在天安门广场。老年社员用笙、箫、管、笛合奏着丰收乐曲，青年小伙子拿着麦穗跳着丰收舞，妇女们也喜悦地唱起“千斤乡出现在全中国”的歌曲。在一片欢腾声中，突然飞起了一群汽球，带着巨幅标语冲上云霄：
    “粮食元帅升帐，产量跃进一倍。”
    “小麦总产量八百亿斤，超过了美国。”
    “棉花产量翻一番，跃居世界第一位。”
    这时观礼台上的外宾和广场上的人群用春雷般的掌声，欢呼我国农业生产在大跃进中获得史无前例的丰收。
    永乐店人民公社的社员高举着稻穗参加游行。女社员张桂芳情不自禁地把一束稻穗抛向天空，她大声地唤着：“毛主席，请您看看我们创造的丰产晚稻。”以深翻土地扬名通州区的五姐妹和十八勇士，今天扛着深掘锹，打着竹板，在人群中兴奋地唱着劳动的歌曲：“深翻麦田一尺半，每亩施肥二十万，麦产指标亩八千，力争突破万斤关，为了共产主义早实现”。
    人民公社社员们，抬着“人民公社好”五个大红字，通过天安门广场。一幅图表告诉人们：全国参加公社的农户已占总农户的90.4％。在这支游行的巨流里，布满了工厂、土高炉和象征着农、林、牧、副、渔生产的高大模型。几个月前刚成为镟工的女农民殷银兰，今天第一次拿着写有“第一代工人”红字的铁锤参加游行。
  全民皆兵，侵略者寸步难行
    乐队又奏起阅兵时的前进曲，民兵的队伍过来了。这些在反对美国侵略者的怒潮中武装起来的民兵们，个个精神抖擞，意志刚强，肩背长枪、手端冲锋枪，腰系子弹带，迈着整齐威武的步伐前进。这时，整个天安门广场轰动起来了。
    今天受检阅的是首都民兵的代表——工人、农民、干部、学生七个师，他们分成二十一个方队通过天安门广场。他们虽然训练时间很短，但是他们的队形和步伐都不亚于正规部队。身穿黑色劳动服、头戴柳条安全帽的工人民兵走在最前列。相继而来的是头扎白毛巾的农民民兵，身著白上衣、蓝裤子的是学生民兵和穿着普通服装干部民兵。很多脸膛晒得黑红的女民兵，雄赳赳地走在干部和学生民兵的队伍里，全场为这些武装起来的女战士一再热烈的鼓掌欢呼。
    “他们组织起来有多久？”看得出神的契尔文科夫同志问毛主席。
    毛主席笑着告诉贵宾：“还不到一个月呢！”
    毛主席并且告诉他说：“北京已经有五十个民兵师，全国各地的民兵在很短的时间就组织起来了。参加民兵进行军事训练，人们的身体很快就好起来，工人和农民生产更好了，学生学习更好了，干部也工作得更好了。”毛主席又说：“这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。”
    刘少奇同志也告诉契尔文科夫同志：“到处是兵，让侵略者寸步难行。”
    在这支队伍里有在钢铁前线日夜奋战的尖兵，也有“二七”老工人的后代。在修建十三陵水库中获得集体荣誉而闻名中外的“九兰组”也武装起来了。这些脸膛晒得黝红的姑娘和其他许多女民兵们，雄赳赳地列队前进。
    从华北最大的水利工程——密云水库工地上赶来的农民武装队伍，由曾在抗日战争中开辟地道战、地雷战的老游击队长苏国良率领前来接受检阅。这位身经百战的老英雄，1946年在香河县安平镇曾率领一百多个民兵，打退了进犯解放区的三百多个有现代化装备的美国强盗，并且打死打伤十四个敌人。他在整队前向他的战士们说：我们有消灭日本鬼子的经验，也有消灭美国强盗的经验，如果美国侵略者敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们一定把它埋葬在台湾海峡里。在这支勇敢的民兵队伍中，有好多是老民兵和老游击队员的子女。祖父当过老红军、父亲又是游击队员的二十四岁的青年农民王培广，今天在受阅前向他身旁的战友说：如果美国强盗敢进犯我们，我就要像我的爷爷、爸爸那样勇敢地向敌人开火。
    游行队伍里出现了往年没有的情景：工农行列里有很多学生，而学生队伍里又有很多工人和农民。在国庆前刚刚成为无文盲区的海淀区农民，今天抬着一支大火箭模型，上面写着他们向文化进军的新指标。
    各个高等学校的学生今天第一次拿着自己劳动生产和科学研究成果的模型图表参加了游行。在这些图表上写着：北京地质勘探学院的师生在两个月内找出了储藏量达一百五十亿吨的铁矿；北京大学的师生苦战四十天，科学研究成果四千一百三十九项，超过了过去二十年研究数目的总和，北京师范大学上山、下乡、下厂参加生产劳动的师生已达十万个劳动日。在清华大学的队伍里，有一批从校办工厂来的学生，穿着工作服，头戴电焊面罩。他们个个面孔黑红，一再举起手中的铁锹、铁锤、铁棍等生产工具，高呼“教育为政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合！”的口号走过了天安门广场。而北京农业大学的一部分学生今天则和郊区万寿山人民公社的农民走在一起。
    科学工作者和
  劳动人民携手前进
    在首都的科学工作者的游行队伍中有张引人注目的图表，写着群众科学研究队伍分布在全国广大农村和城镇的情况，表明科学研究工作已突破了少数专家学者的圈子，广大的劳动者已走进了科学技术界的队伍。
    一群科学工作者在游行前发现了创造农田水利新工具的河南省农民张广义，和首创转炉炼矽钢片的工人田祯祥。田祯祥今天第一次走在科学工作者的游行队伍里，他在最近当选为中国科学技术协会的全国委员。今天他在走到天安门广场时，不停地挥着花束，和一群青年科学工作者肩并肩地高呼：“保证提前五年实现十二年科学研究规划！”“创造钢铁新纪录，向国庆十周年献礼！”
  文艺战士为大丰收
  歌唱，为公社化歌唱
    广场上响起了震耳的鼓、钹声和高亢的锁呐声。五彩缤纷、百花齐放的八千人组成的文艺队伍，随着一支由农民组成的吹管乐队所演奏的“跃进颂”的动人旋律，载歌载舞地通过广场。来自遵化、丰润两县的农民业余歌舞团员同北京群众文艺活动积极分子表演了“丰收舞”和“人民公社欢乐大秧歌”，这时，广场上只见金黄的“麦浪”迎风翻腾，雪白的棉桃上下飞舞，挥动着五色彩绸的“工农商学兵”个个喜笑颜开。
    在一万五千多人的体育大军中，有许多运动健将、体育冠军和新纪录的创造者。在国防体育大队里，有射击、无线电、航海、航空、滑翔机和摩托车等运动队。国防体育运动员们正在“劳武结合，全民皆兵”的号召下，为加强国防、保卫和平而苦学苦练，提高特种军事技能。
    参加今天游行的，还有手工业生产合作社社员、少年先锋队队员、工商业者、市民和宗教界的队伍。
    游行的人们，不断高呼：“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！”“支持阿拉伯民族独立运动！”“支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立运动！”“美英侵略军立即从黎巴嫩和约旦滚出去！”
    在观礼台上的外国客人们热情横溢地挥舞手绢、帽子，向游行的人们致意，他们用照相机、有的用画笔把一幕幕游行的情景迅捷地纪录下来。陪同他们的中国翻译，应接不暇地回答着客人们提出的各种问题。
    伊拉克人民友好访华团团长马哈茂德说，我今天具体地看到了中国人民崭新的精神面貌和建设上的巨大成就。他说中国的胜利就是阿拉伯人民的胜利。参加国际学联代表大会的阿尔及利亚学生代表沙拉尔激动地说，中国支持我们阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，给了我们最大的鼓舞。哥伦比亚自由大学教授埃尔南多·加拉维多木诺斯说：“如果美帝国主义不顾中国人民的一再警告，胆敢继续侵犯中华人民共和国，就一定会彻底失败。”
    下午二时十分游行结束。广场上的人群像海潮一般涌向天安门前，向毛主席以及党和国家其他领导人欢呼致敬。这时，无数的彩色气球、礼花飞上高空，整个天安门广场欢声雷动。在大跃进中创造出惊天动地的成就的人们，尽情地享受着节日的欢乐和光荣。人们欢呼这“一天等于二十年”的伟大时代，欢呼我们气象万千的祖国，欢呼我们胜利的组织者——伟大的中国共产党，欢呼我们万寿无疆的领袖，欢呼千秋万世的子孙们永远引为骄傲的我们这一代英雄豪迈的人民。
