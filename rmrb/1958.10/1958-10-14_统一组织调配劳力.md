    Unified Organization and Deployment of Labor

    (By our correspondent) After the Zhongning County in the Ningxia region realized the people's commune system, it unified the organization and deployment of labor, grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, effectively promoting the simultaneous great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    The Zhongning County Party Committee unified the planning and deployment of more than 50,000 male and female laborers from the five people's communes in the county. On the basis of the original agricultural cooperatives, it formed 39 work teams, more than 500 production teams, and more than 3,000 specialized teams. According to the needs of production, it was divided into five major armies. 22% of the total labor force was concentrated to vigorously develop steel, 63% of the total labor force was invested in the current autumn harvest, deep plowing of autumn stubble, and manure accumulation, and the remaining labor force participated in tool reform, animal husbandry, and forestry production.

    After the commune members were organized to engage in production, the County Party Committee promptly organized labor competitions throughout the county and launched the "one person with multiple skills, one skill with multiple uses" movement, calling on one person to be as effective as several people to promote a comprehensive bumper harvest in industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, the people's communes vigorously ran canteens, nurseries, and rice and flour processing plants, enabling 17,000 female laborers to take up production posts. In addition, the fifteen mobile collaboration groups organized by the people's communes, totaling 15,000 people, also launched mobile warfare, rushing to wherever the task was urgent. Due to the centralized organization of labor and the high enthusiasm of the masses, the county's more than 200,000 mu of autumn crops were harvested half a month earlier than last year, and more than 70,000 mu of summer stubble and autumn stubble land had been deeply plowed to a depth of more than one chi (approximately 1/3 meter). While vigorously carrying out the autumn harvest and deep plowing, the county also drew the first secretaries of the Party committees of various communes, two-thirds of the commune cadres, and more than 400 brigade leaders and production team leaders into the front line of iron smelting, striving to achieve a daily iron production of 1,000 tons by the end of October and complete the annual iron smelting task.

    统一组织调配劳力
    本报讯　宁夏地区的中宁县实现人民公社化以后，统一组织和调配劳力，一手抓工业，一手抓农业，有力地促进了工农业生产同时大跃进。
    中宁县委将全县五个人民公社的五万多个男女劳力统一规划调配，在原农业社的基础上，组成了三十九个作业队，五百多个生产队，三千多个专业队，根据生产需要分成五路大军，将劳力总数的22％集中起来大抓钢铁，以劳力总数的63％投入当前秋收、深翻秋茬和积肥等农活，其余的劳力参加工具改革、畜牧、林业生产。
    社员们组织起来投入生产后，县委又及时在全县范围内组织了劳动竞赛，开展了“一人多技，一技多用”运动，号召一人顶几人，力促工农业生产全面大丰收。同时，各人民公社又大办食堂、托儿所和米面加工厂，使一万七千个妇女劳力走上了生产岗位。另外，人民公社组织的共有一万五千人的十五个机动协作团，也展开了运动战，哪里的任务紧急就到哪里去突击。由于劳动力集中组织，由于广大群众干劲高涨，全县二十多万亩秋作物较去年提前半月收完，深翻的夏茬地和秋茬地深度在一尺以上的已有七万多亩。全县在大搞秋收、深翻地的同时，在钢铁生产上，抽调了各公社的党委第一书记和三分之二的公社干部、四百多名大队长、生产队长投入炼铁第一线，争取10月底日产铁达千吨，并完成全年的炼铁任务。
