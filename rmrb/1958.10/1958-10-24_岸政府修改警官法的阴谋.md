    To the Editor:
    Recently, it was reported that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government is plotting to revise the so-called "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" in an attempt to transform Japan into a police state. What kind of law is this Japanese law? How does the Kishi Nobusuke government intend to revise it? I hope you can provide us with some relevant information in the newspaper.
              Tianjin, Zhao Zhengheng
    Before the war, Japan was a notoriously barbaric "military police state." Currently, the Kishi Nobusuke government, eager to rebuild this military police state, is revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" on the one hand, and revising the Police Officer Duties Execution Law and formulating a secrecy law on the other.
    On October 8, the Kishi Nobusuke government completely disregarded the normal procedure of submitting a bill to the Diet and unilaterally submitted an amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law to the extraordinary session of the Diet. Ignoring strong public opposition and protests from democratic forces, Kishi Nobusuke even claimed that whether the amendment would be forcibly blocked was related to the fate of the country. Obviously, Kishi Nobusuke intends to use police force to compel the passage of the amendment.
    The Police Officer Duties Execution Law was established in 1948 according to the orders of the U.S. occupying forces. As a result of the implementation of this law, the number of police officers has increased, and they are also equipped with old U.S. military revolvers. Currently, the number of police officers has approximately tripled, totaling 130,000. They practice shooting, jujutsu, and swordsmanship every day.
    This armed police force has suppressed the struggle of the Toho Film Studio workers (August 19, 1948), the Labor Day celebration (May 1, 1952), and the struggle against the expansion of the U.S. military's Sunagawa base (October 13, 1956). Recently, workers' and teachers' struggles, such as teachers' opposition to the "performance appraisal" system and Wangzi Paper Mill workers' opposition to the revision of labor contracts, have also been attacked by police forces. Under the armed attacks of the police, most mass struggles have become scenes of bloody fighting.
    The revision of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law signifies the rationalization of the government's suppression policy. Under the amendment, preventive arrests, detentions, interference with gatherings, and mobilization of the Self-Defense Forces, all aimed at suppressing the masses, can be legalized. Such measures mean that the Japanese people will once again suffer the rule of a fascist system.
    According to this amendment, the police of the Kishi Nobusuke government have the right to "warn in cases where criminal acts are clearly about to occur" and have the right to "restrain" "in cases where there is a significant danger of disturbing public safety and order," and these "situations" are to be "determined" by the police officer. The Kishi Nobusuke government's amendment also proposes to add "situations that significantly disturb public safety and order" to the original law's provision that the police authorities have the right to enter "the land, buildings, ships, and vehicles of others when dangerous situations occur that are about to endanger life, body, and property." This means that Japanese police officers can arbitrarily enter any place to persecute the Japanese people based on their "determination" without any legal procedures, and any legitimate activities of the Japanese people opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government, such as gatherings or demonstrations, can be "determined" by Japanese police officers to be "disturbing public safety and order" and arbitrarily suppressed.
    The Kishi Nobusuke government's so-called "effectively preventing crime" is merely a pure excuse. If this amendment of the Kishi Nobusuke government is passed, there is a great danger that the police will abuse their power, and fascist methods such as "preventive detention" and "on-site inspection" before the war will be restored.
    The unilateral proposal of the Police Officer Duties Execution Law amendment has been a huge shock to all classes in Japan. An angry public is brewing large-scale opposition actions.
    The member unions of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and the unions supporting Sohyo have decided to hold a general strike on November 5 to oppose the revision of the Police Officer Law. (Attached picture)

    (2) On May 1, 1952, May Day demonstrators were attacked by countless armed police officers during a demonstration in the so-called People's Square, resulting in 1,500 workers and students being seriously injured.
    (3) In the movement against the expansion of the U.S. military's Sunagawa base, the police carried out barbaric suppression. A helmeted police officer is preparing to tighten a neck ring on a girl participating in the movement.
    (4) On October 7, 1958, more than 900 police officers attacked workers at the Kasugai Factory of Oji Paper, the largest monopoly capital in the paper industry. The workers at the factory held a strike to oppose the company's modification of the labor contract against the workers' will. In the conflict between the police and the workers, 88 workers were seriously injured.
    (5) The All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations convened a national conference in Tokyo to defeat the Police Officer Duties Execution Law. Six hundred people attended. After the meeting, the students marched in the streets.
    (6) Representatives of the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations held up a sign that read: "The government should withdraw the Police Officer Duties Execution Law," and petitioned the Diet on October 10, suffering obstruction from the police.

### 岸政府修改警官法的阴谋

    岸政府修改警官法的阴谋编辑同志：
    最近报载日本岸信介政府阴谋修改所谓“警察官职务执行法”，企图把日本变成为一个警察国家。日本的这一项法律究竟是怎样的法律？岸信介政府企图怎样修改它？希望能在报上给我们提供一些有关的资料。
              天津　赵正恒
    战前，日本就是一个有名的最野蛮的“军事警察国家”。目前，岸信介政府为了急于重建这一军事警察国家，一方面修改日美“安全条约”，另一方面又在修改警察官职务执行法和制订保密法。
    10月8日，岸信介政府完全无视向国会提出议案的正常程序，片面地向国会临时会议提出了关于警察官职务执行法的修正案。岸信介不顾公众的强烈反对和民主力量的抗议，竟然声称：修正案是否会被用强力阻止通过，关系着国家的命运。显然，岸信介打算使用警察力量来强迫通过修正案。
    警察官职务执行法是在1948年根据美国占领军的命令而成立的。这一法律实施的结果，警察人数增加了，而且他们还装备有美军旧有的左轮手枪。目前，警察人数已增加了大约两倍，共有十三万人。他们每天练习射击、柔术和劈剑。
    这支武装警察曾经镇压过东宝映画摄影所工人的斗争（1948年8月19日），劳工节庆祝会（1952年5月1日）和反对美军扩张砂川基地的斗争（1956年10月13日）。最近，工人的和教师们的斗争，例如教师反对“勤务评定”制度和王子造纸厂工人反对修改劳动契约的斗争，也都遭到警察部队的袭击。在警察的武装攻击下，大多数的群众斗争都成了流血搏斗的场面。
    警察官职务执行法的修正，意味着政府镇压政策的合理化。在修正案下，以镇压群众的行动为目的的预防性逮捕、拘禁、干涉集会、动员自卫队都可以合法化起来。这种措施意味着日本人民再一次遭受法西斯制度的统治。
    根据这个修正案，岸信介政府的警察有权“在显然会发生犯罪行为的情况下加以警告”，有权“在有显著地扰乱公共的安全和秩序的危险情况下”加以“制止”，而这些
  “情况”都由警察官来“认定”。岸信介政府的修正案还提出要在原来的法律关于警察当局有权在“发生危险情况，快要危害到生命、身体、财产的时候，可以进入他人的土地、建筑物、船、车”的规定中加上“显著地扰乱公共的安全和秩序的情况”一项。这就是说，日本警察官可以随意根据他的“认定”，不经过任何法律手续，随意进入任何地方迫害日本人民，而日本人民反对岸信介政府的任何集会或示威游行等正当的活动，都可以被日本警察官“认定”是“扰乱公共的安全和秩序”而随意加以镇压。
    岸信介政府所谓要“有效地预防犯罪”，只不过是一种纯粹的借口。岸信介政府的这项修正案如果竟然通过，警察就很有滥用职权的危险，战前的那种“预防性拘留”和“临场检查”等法西斯办法就会恢复实行。
    警察官职务执行法修正案的单方面的提出，对日本各个阶层说来，是一个巨大的震动。愤怒的公众正在酝酿规模宏大的反对行动。
    日本工会总评议会会员工会及支持日本工会总评议会的各工会，决定于11月5日举行总罢工以反对修改警察官法。（附图片）

    （2）1952年5月1日，五一节游行群众在所谓人民广场举行示威的时候，遭到无数的武装警察袭击，造成一千五百名工人与学生重伤。
    （3）在反对美军扩建砂川基地的运动中，警察进行了野蛮的镇压。头戴钢盔的警察正准备勒紧一个参加运动的女孩子的颈圈。
    （4）1958年10月7日，九百多名警察进攻造纸业最大垄断资本所拥有的王子制纸春日井工场的工人。该工场工人为反对资方违反工人意志修改劳工合同，举行了罢工。在警察与工人的冲突中，八十八名工人受重伤。
    （5）全日本学生自治会总联合会在东京召开了全国大会以打倒警察官职务执行法。到会者六百名。会后，学生在街道上游行。（6）全日本学生自治会总联合会代表高举：“政府应撤回警察官职务执行法”的招贴，于10月10日向国会请愿，遭受警察阻挠。
