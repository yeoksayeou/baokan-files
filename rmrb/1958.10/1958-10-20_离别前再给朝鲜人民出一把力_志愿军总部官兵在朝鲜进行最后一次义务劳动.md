Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 19th: Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army headquarters today helped the local Korean people with their final voluntary labor in Korea after eight years of being stationed there.

    In the morning, Volunteer Army Commander General Yang Yong, Political Commissar General Wang Ping, and other generals from the headquarters led all the officers and soldiers of the headquarters, along with local Korean male and female commune members, to climb the steep Xiaoqiantai Mountain to harvest corn. During the labor, they worked as hard as if they were launching a general offensive. Before long, they had harvested all 2,300 pings of corn. General Yang Yong and others, covered in sweat, were still unwilling to rest. They continued to sit knee-to-knee beside the corn piles, chatting and peeling corn, talking about everyday life with the commune members. This kind of labor friendship, forged on the basis of combat friendship, was cherished by everyone. Han Zhiqin, the 61-year-old residents' committee chairman, said, "The Volunteer Army comrades care about us at all times, and they came to help us with the autumn harvest before their departure. Especially the leaders of the Volunteer Army, who came to work for us despite their busy schedules. Words cannot express our gratitude."

    After the corn was harvested, as some of the officers and soldiers began to help the commune members transport it home, the generals led the remaining officers and soldiers to cut soybeans. The commune members watched these Volunteer Army officers and soldiers, who came from the working people, working with soaring enthusiasm and skilled movements, especially since none of the generals had blisters on their hands, and they all praised them endlessly.

    At the same time, a labor force led by Volunteer Army Deputy Political Commissar Lieutenant General Liang Biye also helped Wunan Agricultural Cooperative harvest more than 560 pings of corn within three hours, and transported it all back to the cooperative for the commune members.

    离别前再给朝鲜人民出一把力
    志愿军总部官兵在朝鲜进行最后一次义务劳动
    据新华社平壤19日电　中国人民志愿军总部官兵今天帮助驻地朝鲜人民进行了入朝八年来的最后一次义务劳动。
    上午，志愿军司令员杨勇上将、政治委员王平上将等总部的将军们带领着总部全体官兵和驻地朝鲜男女社员们一起爬上陡峭的小前垈山山腰收割玉米。劳动中，他们像发起总攻击似的猛干，不多时，就把两千三百坪玉米全部收割完了。杨勇上将等累得满头大汗，仍然不肯休息，继续和社员们促膝坐在玉米堆旁谈笑风生地剥玉米、谈家常。这种在战斗友谊上结成的劳动友情，使每个人都倍加珍惜它。六十一岁的居民委员长韩致沁说：“志愿军同志时时刻刻关心我们，离别前又来帮助我们秋收。特别是志愿军首长，在百忙中来为我们劳动，千言万语也说不尽我们内心里的感激。”
    玉米收割完了。当一部分官兵开始帮助社员们向家里运送的时候，将军们又带领其余的官兵割起豆子来。社员们看着这些来自劳动人民的志愿军官兵在劳动中干劲冲天，动作熟练，特别是没有一个将军手上起泡，都赞不绝口。
    与此同时，由志愿军副政治委员梁必业中将带领的一支劳动大军在三小时内也帮助无南农业社收割了五百六十多坪玉米，并全部为社员们运回社里。
