Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st: The Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, said at a reception held by the Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, He Wei, this evening to celebrate China's National Day: The Vietnamese people once again express their determination to stand with the Chinese people, resolutely support the Chinese people in recovering Jinmen and Mazu, liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, defeating the American imperialist aggressors, and giving the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique the punishment it deserves, in order to defend the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

President Ho Chi Minh attended Ambassador He Wei's reception. Also present at the reception were many leaders of the Vietnamese Labor Party, government, and army, heads of various people's organizations, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Vietnam.

Pham Van Dong said: By relying on its own powerful strength, and with the sympathy and support of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world, the Chinese people's just struggle will surely achieve brilliant victory, and American imperialism will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

In his speech, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong expressed warm congratulations to the Chinese people for the great achievements they have made in the great leap forward in economy, culture, science and technology under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government and Chairman Mao Zedong; and expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for their generous and selfless assistance to the Vietnamese people.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, He Wei, delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet. He warmly thanked the Vietnamese government and people for their support to the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialist aggression.

He Wei said that the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that we resolutely oppose the American imperialist "ceasefire" conspiracy, and we must recover Jinmen and Mazu, and we must liberate Taiwan. This is the unwavering determination of 600 million people. If American imperialism dares to provoke a war, the Chinese people will fight to resolutely oppose aggression, safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 1st: Chinese Ambassador to North Korea, Qiao Xiaoguang, held a banquet at the Chinese Embassy in Pyongyang this evening to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Korean Premier Kim Il-sung said in a speech at the banquet that the Korean people, who are as closely linked to the Chinese people as flesh and blood, cannot ignore any act of aggression against the fraternal Chinese people, and the Korean people will always stand with the Chinese people.

He said that the American imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of the People's Republic of China, have violated China's airspace and territorial waters, and are blatantly carrying out military adventures against the Chinese people. They also instigated the Chiang Kai-shek clique to use missiles, which is a challenge to all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and is a heinous act of pushing mankind towards atomic war.

He said that American imperialism should know that the Chinese people and the powerful forces of peace and socialism that actively support the Chinese people will never tolerate this dangerous action of American imperialism. If the enemy continues to provoke and insists on launching a new war, they will surely be burned to ashes by the flames they ignite.

He said that Korea and China are closely united in the socialist family, helping each other and cooperating, and leaping forward towards socialism and communism. No force can stop the prosperity and development of our two countries, nor can it defeat the united strength of our two peoples. This united strength once repelled the armed attack of the American aggressors and shattered the myth of American imperialism as the "strongest in the world."

The Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo attended today's banquet. At the banquet, Guo Moruo raised his glass to express his deep gratitude to the Korean comrades and friends who invited the delegation to participate in the "Korea-China Friendship Month" activities. He proposed a toast to the leap forward development achieved by the people of China and North Korea in the cause of building socialism, and to the militant friendship forged with blood by the people of China and North Korea! Deputy Head of the Delegation Gan Siqi proposed a toast at the banquet to the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and North Korea.

More than 400 people attended the banquet, including leaders and representatives of the working people of the Korean Labor Party, government, Korean People's Army, various democratic parties and social organizations, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to North Korea.

    越朝两国领导人在我国大使国庆宴会上说
    越朝和中国唇齿相依血肉相连  不能坐视美国在台湾海峡挑衅
    新华社河内1日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同今天晚上在中国驻越南大使何伟举行的中国国庆节招待会上说：越南人民再一次表示，他们决心同中国人民站在一起，坚决支持中国人民收复金门、马祖，解放台湾和澎湖列岛，打败美帝国主义侵略者，给蒋介石卖国集团应得的惩罚，以保卫中国领土和主权的完整，保卫远东和世界和平。
    胡志明主席出席了何伟大使的招待会。出席招待会的还有越南劳动党、政府、军队的许多领导人、各人民团体的负责人和各国驻越南的外交使节。
    范文同说：依靠自己强大的力量，并且在以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营和全世界人民的同情和支持下，中国人民的正义斗争一定会取得辉煌胜利，美帝国主义一定要遭到可耻的失败。
    范文同总理在讲话里，对中国人民在中国共产党、中国政府和毛泽东主席英明领导下，在经济、文化、科学技术等方面大跃进所取得的巨大成就表示热烈祝贺；并且对中国人民给予越南人民慷慨无私的援助表示感谢。
    中国驻越南大使何伟在宴会开始时首先致词。他热烈感谢越南政府和人民对中国人民反对美帝国主义的侵略斗争所给予的支持。
    何伟说，中国政府已经屡次声明，我们坚决反对美帝国主义的“停火”阴谋，一定要收复金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾。这是六亿人民不可动摇的决心。美帝国主义如果敢于挑起战争，中国人民将为坚决反对侵略、维护中国的主权和领土的完整而战，为保卫远东和世界和平而战。
    新华社平壤1日电　中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光今天晚上在平壤中国大使馆内举行宴会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年。
    朝鲜内阁首相金日成在宴会上致词说，同中国人民血肉相连的朝鲜人民对于反对兄弟般的中国人民的任何侵略行为决不能置之不理，朝鲜人民将永远同中国人民站在一起。
    他说，美帝国主义者不顾中华人民共和国的多次警告，侵犯中国的领空和领海，露骨地进行反对中国人民的军事冒险。他们还嗾使蒋介石集团使用了导弹，这是对全世界爱好和平国家和人民的挑战，也就是把人类推向原子战争的罪恶行动。
    他说，美帝国主义应当知道，中国人民和积极支持中国人民的强有力的和平和社会主义力量，将绝不会容忍美帝国主义的这一危险行动，如果敌人继续进行挑衅，硬要发动新的战争，那么他们必将被他们燃起的战火烧成灰烬。
    他说，朝中两国紧紧地团结在社会主义大家庭里，互助合作，向社会主义和共产主义飞跃地前进着。任何力量也挡不住我们两国的繁荣发展，也战胜不了我们两国人民的团结的力量。这种团结的力量曾经击退了美国侵略者的武装进攻，粉碎了美帝国主义者所谓它是“世界最强者”的神话。
    以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团参加了今天的宴会。郭沫若在宴会上举杯向邀请代表团前来参加“朝中友好月”活动的朝鲜同志们和朋友们表示深深的感谢。他建议为中朝两国人民在建设社会主义事业中所取得的飞跃的发展、为中朝人民以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊干杯！甘泗淇副团长在宴会上建议为中朝两国人民及其军队的友谊干杯。
    参加宴会的有朝鲜劳动党、政府、朝鲜人民军、各民主政党和社会团体的领导人和劳动人民的代表四百多人，中国人民志愿军代表和各国驻朝鲜的外交使节也参加了宴会。
