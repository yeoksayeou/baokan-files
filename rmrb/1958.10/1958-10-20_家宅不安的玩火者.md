The tense situation in the Taiwan Strait created by Eisenhower and Dulles has placed the U.S. government in a besieged position.

Since Dulles made his blatant statement on September 4th openly interfering with our liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, the vast majority of the United States' one hundred leading newspapers have opposed Washington's policy of playing with fire; the avalanche of protest letters received by the White House, the State Department, and members of Congress, combined with public opinion polls, has created a pressure strong enough to affect the current Republican policy; and because of the upcoming congressional elections, the Democratic Party is taking the opportunity to exploit popular opposition to war, launching an encirclement of the Republican Party. Thus, Washington's outwardly strong but inwardly weak and difficult situation has been exposed even more.

Democrat Dean Acheson, who guided and launched the Korean War during Truman's presidency, almost used the same words that Eisenhower used to scold Truman's invasion of Korea as "foolish" to repay the Eisenhower administration. When running for president in 1952, Eisenhower called Truman's foreign policy a "thoroughly flawed" foolish policy. Today, Acheson accuses Eisenhower of playing with fire on "an issue not worth sacrificing an American life." In 1952, Eisenhower hypocritically questioned Truman: "Should we continue to ignore the Far East for a period of time, and then immediately send our children to Korea to fight and die?" Today, Acheson says that the Eisenhower administration's attitude towards China's coastal islands is also: "Not trying to extricate ourselves from this situation in calm times, and being helpless in times of crisis."

It is not surprising that before the election of 435 members of the House of Representatives and 35 senators, as well as 34 governorships, in the U.S. Congress in November, the Democratic Party used the old trick of accusing the Democratic Party by the Republican Party during the Korean War in 1952, and turned to counter the Republican Party in order to seize a large number of votes. Because the politicians of the two parties in the United States have clearly understood from their long political careers that the most effective means of grabbing votes in various election campaigns is to "run as a peacemaker."

It was based on such considerations that in 1955, when the U.S. military wanted Eisenhower to provoke a war in the Far East for China's coastal islands, the senior Republican think tank headed by former New York Governor Dewey immediately reminded Eisenhower that he was elected in 1952 mainly because of his promise to end the Korean War; if he brought another Far Eastern war to the voters before the 1956 presidential election, it would be political suicide.

But despite the warnings from the "think tank," because Eisenhower's reactionary nature of outward expansion policy was no different from Truman's, the Republican Party had to follow the Democratic Party's footsteps and move towards political suicide. After Eisenhower launched a naked aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, he then stepped to the brink of war in the Far East. In this way, it is obviously impossible for the Republican Party to appear before American voters as a "peacemaker" in this congressional election.

Therefore, when Truman, who was equally rejected by the American people in 1952 for launching the invasion of Korea, now triumphantly issued the "bold statement" that for every Republican member elected this year, two Democratic members would be produced, the Republicans, according to the voters' sentiments, found that they were almost in the misfortune of 1936. At that time, due to the vigorous development of the American labor movement, the seats of the Republican Party, which had always colluded with monopoly capital and was good at suppressing labor, in the Senate and House of Representatives plummeted to only 21.1%, and made the Democratic Party continue to be in power until Eisenhower came to power in 1952.

The Maine election has just caused the Republican Party to suffer an unprecedented defeat, and unfavorable situations for the Republican Party have also appeared in Pennsylvania, California, and even several states in the Republican Party's old base in the Midwest... In this situation, which is described by the American "Newsweek" as "almost desperate (election) situation," due to historical lessons as a warning, some large Republican donors are no longer willing to donate campaign funds to this party. Indeed, since the Republican Party has already lost in the 1958 congressional election, why should monopoly capitalists spend money on a failed deal?

However, although a "disintegration situation" has emerged within the Republican Party, some ambitious figures such as Vice President Nixon and Senator Knowland are still making a final struggle in order to realize their long-cherished dream of entering the White House.

Nixon, who is currently campaigning for the Republican Party in various places, has already retorted to the Democratic Party, asking voters to recall Truman's "achievements," and he also insisted that Eisenhower's current "brinkmanship policy" is a policy of peace, because "a firm policy towards the Communists is a policy of peace, while a weak policy is a policy of war." He also encouraged Republicans by saying: "I don't think there is anything more shameful than fleeing from the struggle when the environment is unfavorable!"

However, Knowland, who gave up his Senate seat and devoted himself to running for governor of California, suffered the misfortune of "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice" in the decline of the Republican Party. Due to his ominous title of "Senator from Formosa," due to his resolute determination to support Chiang Kai-shek in this election, and due to his anti-labor stance, he is destined to fail. And with this failure comes the disillusionment of his dream of entering the White House. Knowland's destined failure has also cast a shadow on Nixon's prospects for becoming a Republican presidential nominee in 1960. Because if Nixon does not help Knowland in his hometown of California in this election, and lets the Democratic Party control this state, then Nixon will lose the votes in this most important state for him, but if he links himself to Knowland's name, which has already stunk in California, then he will also lose votes.

However, what is currently putting pressure on the Republican Party in an urgent manner is not the victory or failure of Knowland or other individual members' elections, but the Democratic Party's attack on the Republican government's policy of playing with fire has greatly weakened the United States' diplomatic position and increased the pressure it suffers from both domestic and foreign countries. Therefore, the Republican Party had to play tricks in diplomacy, pretending to ask Chiang Kai-shek to reduce the garrison in Jinmen to ease domestic and foreign pressure, while at the same time making a "peace" request to the Democratic Party. Secretary of State Dulles specifically met on the 12th with Democratic Senator Green, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has been opposing Eisenhower's Jinmen policy, asking the Democratic Party to "criticize privately" the State Department or the White House, and not to make the government's policy in the Taiwan region a "topic of public debate" in the election campaign.

However, the Democratic Party, which has seized the Republican Party's pigtail in front of the voters, is not willing to let go easily. Although when domestic and foreign public opinion boils to a certain "safety line," the Democratic Party will naturally work with the Republican Party to help the Republican Party out of the predicament, which has become a rule in the past, but in the current critical moment of the congressional election, they also have to use a policy that, in a sense, is very similar to Dulles's "brinkmanship policy." That is to grab the most votes from the debate on the "dangerous" topic of foreign policy. And that is why after the Republican Party repeatedly "sought peace," the spokesman of the Democratic National Committee had to announce on the 15th that Committee Chairman Butler believed that Democrats "have the right" to conduct "constructive and appropriate discussions" on foreign policy. Senator Humphrey also declared that it is the "responsibility of the candidate" to express his attitude on "issues of life and death." The Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are once again playing the old trick of alternately playing the black face and the white face in front of the voters. But playing this trick is very dangerous. Just like American imperialism playing with fire, it will eventually burn itself. The American people will one day see through the faces of these politicians and the hypocrisy of the bourgeois democratic system, and abandon them.

    家宅不安的玩火者
    张振亚
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯在台湾海峡制造的紧张局势，已经使美国政府陷入四面楚歌的处境。
    自杜勒斯9月4日发表了露骨干预我国解放金马的声明以后，美国全国具有代表性的一百家大报纸绝大部分都反对华盛顿的玩火政策；白宫、国务院和国会议员接到的雪片般的抗议信件，另外再加上民意测验结果，这一切已形成了一股对共和党现行政策足够强大的压力；而由于国会选举的临近，民主党更乘机利用人民反对战争的情绪，推波助澜地向共和党发动了围攻。于是华盛顿的外强中干和进退两难的窘境就更加破绽百出地暴露出来。
    在杜鲁门任内曾经引导发动过朝鲜战争的民主党人、前国务卿艾奇逊几乎是用了当年艾森豪威尔责骂杜鲁门的侵朝战争是“愚蠢”的同样的话语来回敬了艾森豪威尔政府。在1952年竞选总统时艾森豪威尔把杜鲁门的外交政策称之为“破绽百出”的愚蠢政策。今天艾奇逊则指责艾森豪威尔是在“不值得牺牲一个美国人的生命的问题”上玩火。1952年时，艾森豪威尔曾假惺惺地质问杜鲁门：“我们是否应该继续在一个时期对远东置之不顾，接着马上把我们的孩子送到朝鲜去作战与死亡呢？”今天艾奇逊则说，艾森豪威尔政府在对待中国沿海岛屿上所抱的态度也是：“在平静的时候不设法使我们从这种情况中脱身出来，而在危机的时候则对此毫无办法。”
    在11月美国国会的四百三十五个众议员和三十五个参议员、另外还有三十四个州长席位进行改选前夕，民主党袭用了1952年朝鲜战争时期共和党指责民主党的故技，反过来回击共和党以便乘机捞取大量选票，这并不稀奇。因为美国两党的政客们从他们的长期政治生涯中已清楚地懂得，在各次竞选运动中捞取选票的最有效的手段就是“以和平缔造者的面目进行竞选。”
    正是基于这样一个考虑，1955年当美国军方要艾森豪威尔在远东为中国沿海岛屿挑起一场战争的时候，以前纽约州长杜威为首的共和党高级智囊团就立刻提醒艾森豪威尔说：他在1952年所以当选主要是由于他的结束朝鲜战争的诺言；如果在1956年总统选举前夕他给选民带来另一场远东战争，那将是政治上的自杀。
    但是尽管有“智囊团”的警告，由于艾森豪威尔的向外扩张政策的反动本质和杜鲁门并无二致，共和党到头来仍然不得不蹈民主党的复辙，走向政治自杀。在艾森豪威尔对黎巴嫩和约旦发动赤裸裸的侵略以后，紧接着又在远东走进战争边缘。这样，在这次国会选举中共和党想再以“和平缔造者”的面目出现在美国选民面前，显然已不行了。
    因此，当那个1952年同样因发动侵朝战争而为美国人民所厌弃的杜鲁门这回竟得意忘形地发出“豪语”说，在今年要争取每选出一个共和党议员，就要产生两个民主党议员的时候，共和党人根据选民的情绪，却发现他们又差不多处于1936年的厄运之中。当时，由于正值美国工人运动蓬勃发展，曾使一向和垄断资本勾结、长于压制劳工的共和党在参众两院的席位惨跌到只占21.1％，并使后来民主党一直执政到1952年艾森豪威尔上台为止。
    缅因州的竞选刚使共和党遭到空前惨败，宾夕法尼亚州、加利福尼亚州甚至连共和党的老巢中西部的几个州，又出现了不利于共和党的形势……在这种用美国“新闻周刊”的话来说，“差不多是绝望的（竞选）局势下”，由于有历史教训作为殷鉴，于是共和党的一些大捐款人就不再愿意为这个党捐献竞选经费。的确，既然共和党在1958年的国会选举中已经输定，垄断资本家们干什么还要在一件失败的交易上花钱呢？
    不过，尽管共和党内已经出现了“瓦解形势”，一些野心勃勃的人物如副总统尼克松、参议员诺兰等为了想实现他们多年来梦寐以求的进入白宫的幻梦，仍然在作最后挣扎。
    目前正在各地为共和党竞选的尼克松已经在对民主党反唇相讥，他要选民们回忆杜鲁门当年的“政绩”，他并且还硬说：艾森豪威尔目前的这种“战争边缘政策”才是和平政策，因为“对共产党人的坚定政策就是和平政策，而软弱的政策才是战争政策。”他还鼓励共和党人说：“我认为再没有什么比环境不顺利时就逃避斗争更为可耻！”
    可是，放弃了参议员席位，一心想竞选加利福尼亚州长的诺兰在共和党没落声中，却遭到了“偷鸡不着蚀把米”的厄运。由于他的“来自福摩萨的参议员”的不祥称号，由于他在这次竞选中仍然坚决抱定支持蒋介石的死硬态度，由于他的反劳工的立场，已经注定了落选。而随着这种落选而来的则是他的进入白宫的梦想的幻灭。诺兰的注定失败，也为尼克松1960年做共和党总统提名候选人的前景蒙上了黑影。因为如果这次尼克松不在他的家乡加利福尼亚州帮助诺兰进行竞选，竟让民主党控制了这个州，那么尼克松就会失掉在这个对他来说最主要的州的选票，可是如果他把自己和诺兰这个在加利福尼亚州已经发臭的名字连在一起，那么他也会同样失掉选票。
    不过目前使共和党感到有燃眉之急的压力的还不是诺兰或其他个别议员的竞选胜利失败问题，而是民主党人对共和党政府玩火政策的攻击已经大大削弱了美国的外交地位，并增加了它所遭受的来自国内国外的压力。因此共和党就不得不在外交上玩弄诡计，假意要蒋介石减少金门驻军以缓和国内外压力的同时，向民主党提出“求和”要求。国务卿杜勒斯12日特意会见了一直在反对艾森豪威尔金门政策的参院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员格林，要求民主党对国务院或者白宫“在私下里进行批评”，而不要使政府在台湾地区的政策成为竞选运动中“公开辩论的题目”。
    不过，在选民面前抓住了共和党小辫子的民主党，却并不肯轻易放手。尽管当国内外舆论沸腾到一定的“安全线”上的时候，民主党自会和共和党一鼻孔出气，来帮助共和党解围，这在过去已成为一项规律，但是在目前国会竞选的紧要关头，他们也还要使用一下从某种意义上说来，很像是杜勒斯的“战争边缘政策”的政策。这就是从外交政策这个“危险”的题目的辩论中，捞取最多的选票。而这也就是为什么在共和党一再“求和”之后，民主党全国委员会的发言人还要在15日宣布说：委员会主席巴特勒认为，民主党人“有权利”对外交政策进行“建设性的、适当的讨论。”参议员汉弗莱也宣称，在“生死攸关的问题上”表示自己的态度是“候选人的责任”。美国的民主和共和两党就这样又在选民面前一个唱黑脸、一个唱白脸地轮番玩弄起老把戏来。但是玩弄这种把戏却是有很大危险性的。这正像美帝国主义玩火一样，终会自焚其身的。美国人民总有一天将识破这些政客们的嘴脸和资产阶级民主制度的虚伪性，而加以抛弃的。
