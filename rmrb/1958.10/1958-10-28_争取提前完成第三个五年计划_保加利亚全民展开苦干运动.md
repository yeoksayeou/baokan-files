Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 27th: According to TASS, a nationwide mass movement is now widely underway throughout Bulgaria, striving to fulfill the Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy (1958-1962) ahead of schedule.  The First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, Zhivkov, said at a meeting of activists from party organizations, economic organizations, and Fatherland Front organizations in the Vratsa region that the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee believes this mass movement is of great significance.  Zhivkov said that the Bulgarian working people have put forward the slogan: "Five-Year Plan - Completed in Three to Four Years." I believe this slogan is realistic.

	Zhivkov said that we have the ability, relying on the masses of the people and guiding their labor enthusiasm and creativity, to victoriously complete the major task of fulfilling the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.  Completing this task will make it possible, in the next five years, that is, by about 1965, to basically solve the problem of establishing Bulgaria's metallurgical industrial base, synthetic raw material base, and agricultural industrial raw material base.  This will create conditions for a new upsurge in the machinery manufacturing industry and light industry, and for a rapid increase in industrial and agricultural output and a reduction in production costs.  Zhivkov pointed out that all this means that we can create the economic and ideological prerequisites for a gradual transition to communism in a very short period of time.

	The working people in urban and rural areas of Bulgaria are currently holding meetings one after another to discuss the issue of completing the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Zhivkov participated in the meeting of activists in the Vratsa region on the 24th and spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he also talked about the strengthening of Bulgaria's agricultural labor cooperatives. He said that, in fact, a movement to unite agricultural labor cooperatives into large-scale socialist agriculture has long been launched from the bottom up in Bulgaria. Now, all the conditions and prerequisites for universally carrying out this movement and victoriously completing this movement are mature.

	Zhivkov then talked about other issues in the development of Bulgarian agriculture.

    争取提前完成第三个五年计划
    保加利亚全民展开苦干运动
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚全国各地现在正在广泛展开全民运动，争取提前完成发展国民经济的第三个五年计划
  （1958—1962年）。保共中央第一书记日夫科夫在弗拉查州党组织、经济组织和祖国阵线组织积极分子会议上讲话时说，保共中央委员会认为，这个全民运动具有重大意义。日夫科夫说，保加利亚劳动人民提出了：“五年计划——三—四年完成”的口号。我认为，这个口号是现实的。
    日夫科夫说，我们有能力依靠人民群众，引导他们的劳动积极性和创造性，来胜利地完成提前完成第三个五年计划这个重大任务。完成这个任务，就使得有可能在下一个五年中，即大约在1965年以前，基本上解决建立保加利亚的冶金工业基地、合成原料基地和农业工业原料基地的问题。这样就将为机器制造业和轻工业的新高涨，为迅速增加工农业产量和降低生产成本创造条件。日夫科夫指出，这一切意味着，我们在很短时期内就可以为逐渐过渡到共产主义创造经济上和思想意识上的前提。
    保加利亚全国城乡劳动人民目前正在纷纷举行集会，讨论提前完成第三个五年计划的问题。日夫科夫在24日参加了弗拉查州州的积极分子会议，并且在会上讲了话。他在讲话中还谈到了保加利亚农业劳动合作社正在加强的情况。他说，事实上在保加利亚早就自下而上地展开了把农业劳动合作社联合为大型社会主义农业的运动。现在，普遍开展这个运动和胜利完成这个运动的一切条件和前提都已经成熟了。
    日夫科夫接着谈到了保加利亚农业发展的其他问题。
