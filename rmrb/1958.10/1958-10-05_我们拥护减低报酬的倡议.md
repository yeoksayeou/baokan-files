    We Support the Initiative to Reduce Remuneration

    As amateur writers, we already have our own professions and salary income, so we don't need so much remuneration. Some things were written because we were very excited, and we didn't expect the state to give us such high remuneration. Such high remuneration is extremely incompatible with the communist spirit of the masses, so we fully support the initiative to reduce remuneration.

    The current remuneration standard is indeed too high. It is not conducive to mobilizing the broad masses to create, but rather hinders the elimination of bourgeois legal rights and becomes a stumbling block to mobilizing creation. Reducing the remuneration standard can allow these many comrades to put down their ideological burdens and create happily.

    We believe that lowering the remuneration standard will make creation flourish.

    我们拥护减低报酬的倡议
    我们业余作者，本来就有自己的职业有薪金收入，用不到这样多的稿费。有些事情，因为内心很激动才写了出来，没有想到国家给我们这样高的稿酬，这样高的稿酬与群众的共产主义精神显得极不适应，所以我们完全拥护降低稿费的倡议。
    现在的稿费标准实在是太高了，不仅不利于发动广大群众进行创作，反而不利于破除资产阶级法权思想，成了发动创作的绊脚石。减低稿费标准能使这许多同志放下思想包袱，愉快地进行创作。
    我们相信降低稿费标准后，会使创作繁荣起来。
