Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd. The "Soviet Naval News" published today an article commenting on the order of our Ministry of National Defense to resume the bombardment of Jinmen.

The article pointed out that the American aggressors are attempting to use the temporary calm in the coastal islands area of China to supply the Chiang Kai-shek clique with new weapons. While most Chinese people in Taiwan welcome the Chinese government's peace talks proposals, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is even more frantically continuing war provocations.

The article, in discussing Dulles' conspiracy activities in Taipei, pointed out that this trip to Taiwan is Dulles' fifth in recent years. Each time he goes to Taiwan, there will be provocations against world peace by the US and Chiang. His trip to Taipei makes it clearer to people that the United States is responsible for the tension in the Taiwan Strait. The key to resolving the tension in this region is for the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw American troops from the Taiwan area.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 22nd. Today's "People's Defense Daily" wrote that the People's China's just action of resuming the bombardment of Jinmen demonstrates its strength and its determination to liberate all its territory. The newspaper also said that this decision further demonstrates that China will not tolerate the provocative interference of the United States, which continues to worsen the crisis.

While criticizing the negotiations being held by Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek, the newspaper emphasized that peace will only be possible when the American troops withdraw from Chinese territory and the United States no longer interferes in China's internal affairs.

The newspaper concluded that the recent decision of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense makes the whole world realize once again the urgent necessity: the United States must stop its provocations on the brink of war and let the people of all countries resolve their own internal affairs.

“Labor Daily” criticized the Taiwan authorities for rejecting the proposal for peace talks, pointing out that Peng Dehuai's recent order was completely justified and necessary. The newspaper also said that the People's China cannot be intimidated, and they will never give up their legitimate demand: the American troops must withdraw from the Taiwan area.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd. Vietnam's "People's Daily" published a commentary today saying that it is a very just thing for the Chinese government to resume the bombardment of Jinmen to punish the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The commentary said that the government of the People's Republic of China has twice stopped the bombardment of Jinmen, which fully expresses the Chinese government's humanitarianism and peaceful will. However, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan still does not accept peace talks, and further relies on American imperialism to step up preparations for war and introduce American military escorts in the Jinmen waters. Faced with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's unrepentant attitude, it is very necessary for the government and people of the People's Republic of China to resolutely punish them. This correct measure of the Chinese government will surely receive widespread support from world opinion.

The commentary condemned American imperialism for stepping up the concentration of troops in the Taiwan area, preparing to assist the Taiwan authorities to expand their aggression against China. The commentary said that Chiang Kai-shek's request for American warships to escort ships and the United States' deliberate violation of the order of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense are clearly related to Dulles, Robertson, and American generals' hasty trip to Taiwan to discuss strengthening US-Chiang cooperation with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The United States is still trying every possible means to confuse the dispute between China and the United States with China's civil war, attempting to legitimize American interference in China's internal affairs. But their trickery cannot deceive anyone.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 21st. All Albanian newspapers on the 21st prominently published the order of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense on resuming the bombardment of Jinmen. "Unity Daily" also published a commentary on this.

"Unity Daily" said that the current measures of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense are completely correct; because the great Chinese people will never allow foreigners to occupy Chinese territory, and will never be afraid of the intimidation of aggressors.

The commentary pointed out that the Chinese government has made every effort to liberate Taiwan, a matter related to the internal affairs of the Chinese people.

The commentary said that in order not to escalate the situation in the Far East, the Chinese people have done everything possible to stop the American aggressors' provocations against China and against all the Chinese people. Despite this, the aggressors continue to carry out provocations and intimidation.

The commentary pointed out that Dulles' visit to Taiwan shows that he wants to cling to Chiang Kai-shek, insist on the American aggressive policy, and further expand the conflict in the Far East. The world's public opinion is extremely indignant at this provocative action of the United States against China, and demands that "the American aggressors get out of China."

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 22nd. Poland's "Freedom Fighter Daily" published an article today on the order of our Ministry of National Defense to resume the bombardment of Jinmen, saying that American warships continue to "escort" Chiang Kai-shek's ships in Jinmen, destroying the conditions for the suspension of the bombardment proposed by China, and becoming the reason for resuming the bombardment of Jinmen. The newspaper also said that the essence of the problem is that the Chiang Kai-shek clique refuses to negotiate.

The article also criticized the provocative propaganda campaign recently launched by American newspapers. The article pointed out that they interpreted the People's Republic of China's decision to suspend the bombardment as if it were proof of China's weakness, and clamored to continue pursuing the American policy of interfering in China's internal affairs.

    中国人民显示了解放领土决心
    兄弟国家舆论支持我国恢复炮击金门
    新华社莫斯科22日电　“苏联海军报”今天发表了一篇评论我国国防部恢复炮击金门的命令的文章。
    文章指出，美国侵略者企图利用中国沿海岛屿地区的暂时寂静以便供应蒋介石集团新的武器。当大多数台湾的中国人欢迎中国政府的和谈建议时，蒋介石集团却更疯狂地继续进行战争挑衅。
    文章在谈到杜勒斯到台北的阴谋活动时指出，这次到台湾是杜勒斯最近几年来的第五次。他每次到台湾都要发生美蒋对世界和平的挑衅。他的台北之行更清楚地告诉人们，对于台湾海峡地区的局势紧张，美国要负责任。解决这个地区紧张局势的关键是美国停止对中国内政的干涉，把美国军队从台湾地区撤出去。
    新华社布拉格22日电　今天的
  “人民防线报”写道，人民中国恢复炮击金门的这个正当的行动，证明了它的力量和它要解放全部领土的决心。报纸又说，这个决定进一步表明，中国不会容忍继续使危机恶化的美国的挑衅性干涉行动。
    在抨击杜勒斯和蒋介石正在举行的谈判时，报纸强调说，只有美国军队撤出中国领土和美国不再干涉中国内政，才会有利于和平。
    报纸最后说，中国国防部最近的决定使全世界再次认识到这种迫切的必要性：美国必须停止在战争边缘上的挑衅，并让各国人民自己解决他们的内部事务。
      “劳动报”抨击台湾当局拒绝举行和平会谈的建议时指出，彭德怀最近的命令是完全正当的和必要的。报纸又说，人民中国是吓不倒的，他们决不会放弃他们的正当要求：美国军队必须撤出台湾地区。
    新华社河内22日电　越南“人民报”今天发表评论说，中国政府恢复炮击金门以惩罚蒋介石集团，这是一件非常正当的事情。
  评论说，中华人民共和国政府先后两次停止炮击金门，这完全表达了中国政府的人道主义和和平意志。但是台湾的蒋介石集团仍然不接受和谈，而且还进一步依靠美帝国主义来加紧备战，在金门海域引进美军护航。面对蒋介石集团这种毫无悔悟的态度，中华人民共和国政府和人民坚决惩罚它们是非常必要的。中国政府的这一个正确措施一定会得到世界舆论的广泛支持。
    评论谴责美帝国主义加紧在台湾地区集结兵力，准备援助台湾当局以扩大对中国的侵略的阴谋。评论说，蒋介石请美国军舰护航和美国有意违反中国国防部的命令，这显然是同杜勒斯、罗伯逊和美国将领匆忙到台湾同蒋介石集团讨论加强美蒋合作有关的。美国仍然千方百计要把中美之间的争端和中国内战混在一起，企图使美国对中国内政的干涉合法化。但是他们的这种伎俩是骗不了人的。
    新华社地拉那21日电　阿尔巴尼亚各报21日都以显著地位刊登了中国国防部关于恢复炮击金门的命令。“团结报”并就此发表了评论。
      “团结报”说，中国国防部的当前措施是完全正确的；因为伟大的中国人民任何时候也不容许外国人侵占中国的领土，任何时候也不害怕侵略者的恐吓。
    评论指出，中国政府在解放台湾这样一个关系中国人民内政的问题上，已经尽了一切努力。
    评论说，为了不使远东局势加剧，中国人民已尽一切可能使美国侵略者停止反对中国、反对全体中国人民的挑衅。尽管如此，侵略者却继续进行挑衅和恐吓。
    评论指出，杜勒斯的访问台湾表明他要死抱着蒋介石，坚持美国的侵略政策并进一步扩大远东地区的冲突。全世界的舆论对美国反对中国的这种挑衅行动都感到无比的愤慨，并要求“美国侵略者滚出中国去。”
    新华社华沙22日电　波兰“自由战士报”今天就我国国防部恢复炮击金门的命令发表文章说，美国军舰继续在金门为蒋介石的船只“护航”，破坏了中国提出的暂停炮击的条件，成了恢复炮击金门的原因。报纸又说，问题的实质是：蒋介石集团拒绝谈判。
    文章还指责美国报纸最近展开的挑衅性的宣传活动。文章指出，它们把中华人民共和国的暂停炮击的决定解释为似乎是中国软弱的证明，并叫嚣继续奉行美国干涉中国内政的政策。
