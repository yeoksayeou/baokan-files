    Five Sons Achieve Scholarly Success
    Big sweet potato, many sons,
    Each one grows like a King Kong,
    The eldest son is named "Surpass England and America,"
    The second son is nicknamed "Little Moon,"
    The third son is named "Hero,"
    The fourth son is called "Sweet Potato King,"
    The youngest one, the smallest,
    Is called "One Hundred and Fifty-Two Jin Strong";
    Five sons achieve scholarly success, all take command,
    The bean counter is sent to calculate accounts!
    When the bean counter hears this, he's terrified,
    He crawls under the bed, stifling his voice.
        (Ma Hanzhong)

    五子登科
    大地瓜，多儿郎，
    个个长得赛金刚，
    大儿名叫超英美，
    二儿外号小月亮，
    三儿起名英雄汉，
    四儿就叫地瓜王，
    落了小五个最小，
    它叫一百五十二斤强；
    五子登科齐挂帅，
    齐和算账派来算账！
    算账派一听害了怕，
    爬到床下闷了腔。
        （马汉忠）
