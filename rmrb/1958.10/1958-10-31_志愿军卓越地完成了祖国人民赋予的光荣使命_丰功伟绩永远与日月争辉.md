Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Yang Yong gave a report on the eight years of work of the Chinese People's Volunteers at an enlarged joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The joint meeting was held in Huairen Hall. The atmosphere in the meeting place was solemn. General Yang Yong's "Report on the Work of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Resisting America and Aiding Korea Over the Past Eight Years," made on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Volunteers, was also a report to the people of the motherland. The report, containing more than 20,000 words, is an epic of magnificent heroism written in the blood and sweat of the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers. The great contributions made by the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland to the cause of peace will forever shine with the sun and moon. During Yang Yong's report, all members repeatedly expressed their respect to the most beloved people with stormy applause, congratulating the Volunteers on their great achievements.

The meeting started at 2:00 p.m. When General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping led the delegation of the Volunteers into the meeting place, all members stood up and applauded warmly to welcome them.

Accompanying General Yang Yong, General Wang Ping, senior generals of the Volunteers, and combat heroes on the rostrum were: Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; He Xiangning and Bao Erhan, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Premiers of the State Council; Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; and Liao Chengzhi, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea.

Vice Chairman Peng Zhen delivered the opening speech. Peng Zhen said that eight years ago, in order to resist America and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend the country, the Chinese people dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to fight against the American aggressors together with the Korean people. After three years of heroic fighting, they defeated the most insane imperialist bandits in the world, completed the glorious task of resisting America and aiding Korea and protecting our homes and defending the country, and maintained peace in the Far East and the world. After the Korean armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers also participated in the economic recovery and economic construction of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with selfless labor. Now, they have returned victoriously to the motherland. Peng Zhen said with enthusiasm, let us express our warm welcome and high respect to all commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, our most beloved people.

Subsequently, General Yang Yong gave a report to the joint meeting. Yang Yong first narrated the course of the Chinese People's Volunteers' struggle to resist America and aid Korea over the past eight years, as well as the significance of the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people in resisting American aggression. He said that the Chinese People's Volunteers, together with the Korean People's Army, after three years of arduous struggle, under extremely difficult material conditions at the time, with unparalleled heroism, tenacity, and amazing hard work, repelled the American aggressors and their accomplice armies. In the three-year war, the Chinese and Korean People's armies jointly annihilated 1.09 million enemies, including 390,000 American troops; shot down and damaged more than 12,000 enemy planes, and destroyed and captured more than 3,000 tanks. The American aggressors, under the banner of the United Nations, had no choice but to sign the armistice agreement after suffering a disastrous defeat.

Yang Yong said that the Korean War proved that if peace-loving people want to achieve peace, they can only do so through resolute struggle against the imperialist aggressors.

He said forcefully that the largest and most brutal war of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism after World War II was defeated by the Chinese and Korean people. The true face of the paper tiger was exposed, and the myth of invincibility was shattered. The Chinese and Korean people solemnly declared to the world with iron facts that the era of imperialist tyranny is gone forever.

General Yang Yong expressed to the joint meeting with great emotion the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood and lasting forever. When Yang Yong spoke of the touching deeds of the Korean people who sacrificed themselves and disregarded their own lives to support the Volunteers, the audience erupted in long and enthusiastic applause.

Yang Yong said that in China's past domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people had spared no effort to sacrifice their lives to support the Chinese people's struggle. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression, the Korean people and the heroic People's Army, fearing no difficulties, bravely persisted in the just war against American aggression, resisting the most powerful imperialist aggressor army in the world. The Korean people paid a great price and made important contributions to winning the war. This is not only an integral part of the struggle between peace and socialist forces and war and imperialist forces, but also the greatest and most direct assistance to our people. Now, the Korean people and the heroic Korean People's Army stand on the eastern front line against imperialism, continuing to defend peace in the Far East, which is still the most direct support for our country, and the significance of this assistance is invaluable.

Yang Yong said that in the past eight years, the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Volunteers is endless and indescribable. Yang Yong listed many touching facts of Premier Kim Il-sung and other leaders of the Korean Party and government, as well as the Korean people, who took care of and cared for the Volunteers in every possible way, both materially and spiritually. He said with deep emotion that even the cemeteries of the Chinese People's Volunteers martyrs who are buried on Korean soil—the martyrs' cemeteries—have received the kind care of the Korean government and people. Yang Yong conveyed to the meeting the words of an old Korean man who guarded the martyrs' cemetery when he was leaving: "Please tell the martyrs' parents, brothers, sisters, wives, and children that as long as there are Korean people, we must protect the martyrs' graves well." Yang Yong said excitedly that not only we and the martyrs' families will be grateful, but also the martyrs who are buried on Korean soil will smile in their graves.

Yang Yong finally said that in the past eight years, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Volunteers have fulfilled their due obligations for the motherland, for the people, for the friendship between China and Korea, and for peace in the Far East and the world. The martyrs who dedicated their lives for this and their heroic deeds will be immortal!

He emphasized that the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea is the result of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the result of the full support of the people of the motherland. All comrades of the Volunteers will firmly remember that glory belongs to the Party and Chairman Mao, and glory belongs to the people of the motherland.

General Yang Yong said that at present, U.S. imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and the task of completely liberating the territory of the motherland has not yet been completed. The Chinese people must drive U.S. imperialism out of Taiwan, and Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must return to the embrace of the motherland.

Yang Yong firmly stated that all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers who have returned home are ready to listen to the call of the motherland at any time and contribute all their strength to the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

General Yang Yong's report was full of the passionate feelings of the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. With the heroic spirit of the Volunteers, he extremely despised the American paper tiger; with the most beautiful language of the sons and daughters of the motherland, he expressed his deep feelings for the motherland, for the mother; his love for the Korean people is like the endless Yalu River, which cannot be fully expressed. This epic report, word by word, sentence by sentence, is soul-stirring and sonorous. The audience expressed their warmest congratulations to the heroes with countless fervent applause.

The joint meeting unanimously adopted a resolution at the end, praising the great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers with extremely high evaluation. The resolution pointed out that the Chinese People's Volunteers are worthy of being the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, and the martyrs who contributed their precious lives in the battle to resist America and aid Korea will be immortal! The resolution also called on the people of the whole country to make persistent efforts and fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and to complete the sacred cause of unifying the motherland.

After the resolution was passed, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen said finally, let us once again express our most sincere gratitude and high respect to our most beloved people—all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers. At this time, the whole audience stood up, Comrade Peng Zhen and Generals Yang Yong and Wang Ping shook hands warmly, and the thunderous applause in the meeting place lasted for more than ten minutes.

    志愿军卓越地完成了祖国人民赋予的光荣使命
    丰功伟绩永远与日月争辉
    杨勇上将在人大常委会和政协常委会扩大联席会议上报告八年来工作
    新华社30日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会和政协全国委员会常务委员会今日下午举行扩大的联席会议，听取中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将关于志愿军八年来工作的报告。
    联席会议在怀仁堂举行。会场上充满了庄严的气氛。杨勇上将代表志愿军全体指战员作的“中国人民志愿军八年来抗美援朝工作报告”，也是志愿军向祖国人民的汇报。两万多字的报告是志愿军指战员用血汗写成的一本可歌可泣的壮丽的史诗，祖国优秀儿女为和平事业作出的伟大贡献，将永远与日月争辉。在杨勇报告的过程中，全体委员不断以暴风雨般的掌声向最可爱的人表示敬意，祝贺志愿军的丰功伟绩。
    会议从下午二时开始。杨勇上将和王平上将为首的志愿军代表团进入会场时，全体委员起立热烈鼓掌，表示欢迎。
    陪同杨勇上将、王平上将和志愿军的高级将领以及战斗英雄们在主席台上就座的有：中共中央政治局委员、人大常委会副委员长彭真，人大常委会副委员长李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、程潜，政协全国委员会副主席何香凝、包尔汉，国务院副总理李富春、李先念，国防委员会副主席张治中，中国人民抗美援朝总会副主席廖承志。
    彭真副委员长致开会词，彭真说，八年以前，中国人民为了抗美援朝、保家卫国，派遣了以自己的优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民一起抗击美国侵略者。经过三年的英勇战斗，打败了世界上最疯狂的帝国主义强盗，完成了抗美援朝、保家卫国的光荣任务，维护了远东和世界和平。在朝鲜停战以后，中国人民志愿军又以忘我的劳动，参加了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的经济恢复和经济建设工作。现在，他们胜利地回到祖国来了。彭真热情地说，让我们向英雄的中国人民志愿军的全体指战员，我们最可爱的人，表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    随后，杨勇将军向联席会议作了报告。杨勇首先叙述了中国人民志愿军八年来抗美援朝斗争的经过，以及中朝人民反抗美国侵略伟大胜利的意义。他说，中国人民志愿军同朝鲜人民军一起，经过三年苦战，在当时极端困难的物质条件下，以无比的英勇顽强和惊人的刻苦精神，打退了美国侵略者和他的帮凶军队。在三年战争中，朝中人民军队共同歼灭敌人一百零九万，其中包括美军三十九万；击落击伤敌机一万二千多架，击毁和缴获坦克三千多辆。打着联合国旗号的美国侵略者，在遭到惨败以后，才不得不在停战协定上签了字。
    杨勇说，朝鲜战争以事实证明：爱好和平的人民，要想得到和平，只有同帝国主义侵略者进行坚决的斗争。
    他有力地说，美帝国主义在第二次世界大战之后发动的一次规模最大的最残暴的侵略战争，被朝中人民打败了。纸老虎的真象被戳穿了，不可战胜的神话破灭了。朝中人民以铁的事实向全世界庄严地宣告：帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。
    杨勇将军以激动的感情向联席会议倾述了中朝人民用鲜血结成的万古长存的伟大友谊。当杨勇谈到朝鲜人民舍己为人、不顾牺牲自己生命来支援志愿军的种种可歌可泣的事实时，全场爆发起长久的热烈的掌声。
    杨勇说，远在中国人民历次国内革命战争和抗日战争中，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女曾经不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民的斗争。在反抗美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，朝鲜人民和英雄的人民军，不怕一切困难，英勇地坚持着反抗美国侵略的正义战争，抗击着世界上最强大的帝国主义侵略军队。朝鲜人民为争取战争的胜利，付出了很大代价，作出了重要贡献。这不仅是和平和社会主义力量同战争和帝国主义力量斗争中不可分割的一部分，而且是对我国人民最大和最直接的援助。现在，朝鲜人民和英雄的朝鲜人民军站在反帝国主义的东方最前线，继续捍卫着远东和平，这仍然是对我国最直接的支援，这种援助的意义是无可估价的。
    杨勇说，八年来，朝鲜人民对待志愿军的深情厚谊是说不完也道不尽的。杨勇列举了金日成首相和朝鲜党政其他领导人、朝鲜人民，对志愿军从物质上以至精神上，都是无微不至地爱护、关怀的许多感人的事实。他带着深沉的感情说，就是长眠在朝鲜国土上的中国人民志愿军烈士的墓地——烈士陵园，也受到了朝鲜政府和人民亲切备至的关怀。杨勇在会上转告了一位看守烈士陵园的朝鲜老人在临别时的寄言：“请转告烈士们的父母兄弟妻子儿女，只要有朝鲜人民在，就一定要把烈士墓保护得好好的。”杨勇激动地说，对此，不仅我们和烈士们的家属将感激不尽，就是长眠在朝鲜国土的烈士们，也当含笑九泉。
    杨勇最后说，八年来，志愿军的广大官兵，为祖国、为人民、为中朝友谊，为远东和世界和平尽到了他们应尽的义务。为此而献出了自己生命的烈士们和他们的英雄事绩将永垂史册！
    他强调说，抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，是党和毛主席英明领导的结果，是祖国人民全力支援的结果。志愿军的全体同志，都将牢牢记住：光荣属于党和毛主席，光荣属于祖国人民。
    杨勇将军说，目前，美帝国主义仍然霸占着我国领土台湾，全部解放祖国领土的任务还没有完成。中国人民一定要把美帝国主义赶出台湾去，台、澎、金、马一定要回到祖国的怀抱。
    杨勇坚决地表示：我们归国的中国人民志愿军全体同志，准备随时听候祖国的召唤，为解放台、澎、金、马而贡献自己的一切力量。
    杨勇将军的报告充满了中国人民最优秀儿女的热烈磅礴的感情。他以志愿军英雄的气概，极端地藐视了美国纸老虎；他以祖国儿女最美好的语言，抒发了对祖国、对母亲深切的感念；他对朝鲜人民热爱之情，犹如流不尽的鸭绿江水，说也说不完。这篇史诗般的报告，字字句句，动人心魄，铿锵有声。全场以无数次狂热的掌声向英雄们表示最热烈的祝贺。
    联席会议最后一致通过了决议，以极高的评价表彰了中国人民志愿军的丰功伟绩，决议指出，中国人民志愿军不愧为伟大中国人民的优秀儿女，在抗美援朝的战斗中贡献出宝贵生命的烈士们，永垂不朽！决议并号召全国人民必须再接再厉，为解放台、澎、金、马，完成统一祖国的神圣事业，而奋斗到底。
    通过决议以后，彭真副委员长最后说，让我们再一次向我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军全体指战员同志们，表示最亲切的感谢和崇高的敬意。这时，全场起立，彭真同志和杨勇、王平将军热烈握手，会场上春雷般的鼓掌声延续了十多分钟。（附图片）
