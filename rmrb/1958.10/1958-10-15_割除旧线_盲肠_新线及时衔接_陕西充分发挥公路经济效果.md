Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, October 14th: In the midst of the nationwide effort to develop transportation, various localities in Shaanxi are beginning to pay attention to fully leveraging the economic effects of existing and under-construction highways.

To date, the province of Shaanxi has invested a total of 200,000 laborers in building 7,500 kilometers of highways and improving 979 kilometers of existing highways. On the old highway lines, many places are experiencing a situation where "one finger can block the whole team." A long, smooth highway is occasionally interrupted by a small section of very bad road, or becomes impassable during rain, causing the entire line to be paralyzed. Many newly built highways are mostly completed, but the entire line cannot be utilized in a timely manner because a small section in the middle has been delayed.

The relevant provincial leading departments are now taking the following measures to change this situation: First, they are improving project arrangements to ensure that newly built highways are connected in a timely manner, building and using them section by section. In the mountainous areas of Xixiang and Zhenba counties, they are focusing on rapidly building one section after another, using each section as it is completed, saving a large amount of labor and animal power. Second, they are striving to open the roads to rough traffic as soon as possible, and then gradually improve them. As a result, the Langao to Ankang and Zhenan to Shanyang lines were opened to traffic three months ahead of schedule. Third, they are cutting out the "appendixes" in existing lines, and five major bridge projects are now under construction ahead of schedule. Fourth, they are repairing the road surfaces of important trunk lines and modifying places with large curves and slopes to enable trucks to pull trailers.

### 割除旧线“盲肠”　新线及时衔接  陕西充分发挥公路经济效果

    割除旧线“盲肠”　新线及时衔接
    陕西充分发挥公路经济效果
    据新华社西安14日电　陕西各地在全民大办交通事业中，开始注意到充分发挥已有和正在修建的公路的经济效果。
    到目前为止，陕西全省共投入二十万个劳动力，兴建七千五百公里公路，改善九百七十九公里的原有公路。在旧有公路线上，不少地方存在着“一个指头挡驾”的情况，长长的一条畅通的公路中间，间或有一小段路面很坏，或遇雨不能通车，就使全线陷于瘫痪。一些新修的公路，许多地方都已修好，只是因为中间某一小段迟迟没有修好，全线就不能及时利用。
    省有关领导部门现在正采取下列措施改变这种状况。一、作好工程安排，使新修公路及时联结起来，修一段用一段。西乡和镇巴县山区都正在一段接一段地突击修，修一段用一段，节省大批劳力和畜力。二、争取尽快先粗通车，以后再逐步提高。这样做的结果，岚皋到安康、镇安到山阳线，都比原计划提前三个月通车。三、割除现有线路中的“盲肠”，现在有五处大桥工程都已提前施工。四、整修重要干线的路面，改修弯度、坡度大的地方，使货车能带拖车。
