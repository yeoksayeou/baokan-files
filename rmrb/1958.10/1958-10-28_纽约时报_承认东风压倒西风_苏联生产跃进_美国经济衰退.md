Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from New York, October 26th, TASS: The "New York Times" reporter, Schwartz, emphasized in an article: "In the post-war years, the rate of production increase in the Soviet economy has been much faster than in the United States... The U.S. recession has particularly severely affected heavy industry, which stands in stark contrast to the new growth of Soviet industrial and agricultural production."

Schwartz cited steel production as an example. He wrote that if the U.S. steel production shrinks to nearly 85 million tons this year, then Soviet steel production will reach 60 million tons.

He pointed out that the increasing growth of Soviet production, the stagnation and reduction of U.S. production, and the welcome of underdeveloped countries to Soviet industrial equipment, are making many leaders of the U.S. and Western countries increasingly uneasy. They are worried that if this situation continues to develop, it will bring serious political consequences.

Schwartz believes that the Soviet economy will continue to maintain a high rate of development in the future. He emphasized that the guarantee of this is: "The Soviet Union has abundant resources, a large number of educated people, and the Soviet Union has mastered modern technology in the most important economic sectors." He said: "Obviously, these factors can guarantee that huge economic progress will continue indefinitely."

    “纽约时报”承认东风压倒西风
    苏联生产跃进　美国经济衰退
    新华社27日讯　塔斯社纽约26日讯：“纽约时报”记者什瓦茨在一篇文章里强调说：“战后年代里，苏联经济中生产增加的速度要比美国快得多……美国的衰退特别严重地影响了重工业，这同苏联工农业生产的新增长适成对照。”
    什瓦茨举钢产量为例。他写道，如果今年美国的钢产量缩减到将近八千五百万吨，那么苏联的钢产量将达到六千万吨。
    他指出，苏联生产的日益增长和美国生产的停滞和减缩以及不发达国家对苏联工业设备的欢迎，使得美国和西方国家政府的许多领导人越来越不安。他们担心，如果这种情况长此发展下去，就会带来严重的政治后果。
    什瓦茨认为，今后苏联经济仍将保持高速度发展。他强调指出，这方面的保证是：“苏联拥有丰富的资源，众多的有文化的人民，苏联在最重要的经济部门中掌握了现代的技术”。他说：“显然，这些因素可以保证巨大的经济进步会无止境地继续下去。”
