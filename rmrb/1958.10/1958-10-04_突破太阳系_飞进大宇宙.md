Breaking Through the Solar System and Flying into the Great Universe
Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

October 4, 1957, is a date to be commemorated in human history. On that very day, thanks to the diligent work of Soviet workers, engineers, and scientists, they successfully launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite. Approximately one month later, they launched a second artificial satellite, even heavier than the first. And in May of this year, the third satellite they launched reached an astounding weight of 1,327 kilograms. Before the launch of the artificial Earth satellites, and during the launch of these satellites, the Soviet Union also launched a series of high-altitude sounding rockets. Through this series of studies, Soviet scientists have clarified various natural phenomena in the space surrounding the Earth, as well as the physiological conditions of organisms at high altitudes and under weightlessness, thereby making a huge contribution to the ongoing International Geophysical Year research work around the world. More importantly, because of these achievements of the Soviet people, no one can say that the scope of human activity is limited to the Earth; we will, in the not-too-distant future, break through the small world of the Earth's body and travel to the Moon and other planets in the solar system. That is to say, the Soviet working people have opened up a new era of interplanetary travel for mankind.

Faced with the great achievements of the Soviet Union, the rulers of the United States felt threatened. The science and technology they had boasted about could no longer frighten people. Those "ping-pong balls" they put into the sky only provoked laughter. People all over the world can see clearly that the level of science and technology in the Soviet Union has far surpassed that of the United States; and the Soviet Union has caught up from behind, and once it surpasses, it will definitely continue to lead until the day capitalism is destroyed. All this proves the superiority of the socialist system. Under the socialist system, science and technology, with the leadership of the Communist Party, can develop forward at an unprecedented speed. Therefore, the victory of the Soviet Union in launching artificial Earth satellites is a victory of socialism, and we commemorate this victorious day with joy!

We also realize that, for the development of the entire space travel, although we have taken a groundbreaking first step today, it is still the first step. The work ahead is huge and difficult, and it requires our arduous struggle to gradually realize the entire ideal. What is our whole ideal? The entire ideal is: starting from the launch of artificial Earth satellites, we will further launch unmanned probes to the Moon; and then launch unmanned probes to Mars and other solar system planets. Then, launch manned Earth satellites, and enable people to return safely to Earth. With these foundations, we can consider going to see the Moon and Mars; but we cannot safely land on the surface of the Moon or Mars, let alone safely return from the Moon or Mars to the surface of the Earth; that is a further step. To conquer the solar system, we must be able to land on various planets or satellites, not only land but also return to Earth. But is completely conquering the solar system the ultimate goal of space travel? No. This is because the solar system is still very small in the entire universe. There are thousands upon thousands of other stars, that is, thousands upon thousands of suns, some of which are much larger than our sun, in the entire Milky Way galaxy. And the Milky Way galaxy is not the entire universe. The Milky Way galaxy is just one galaxy system. There are other nebulae in the universe, and there are thousands upon thousands of nebulae systems. Not only are there many suns and nebulae, but the distances in the universe are also staggering. Among the stars we now know, the closest one, Proxima Centauri, is about ten thousand times larger than the solar system. This is still a close neighbor. The entire Milky Way galaxy is naturally larger than the solar system, one hundred million times the size of the solar system. And this is only talking about one Milky Way galaxy among thousands upon thousands of nebulae. The distance to other nebulae is even more unimaginable. The nebula that the largest telescope can see now is a hundred million trillion kilometers away from us, which is ten billion times the size of the solar system!

The farther we want to run, the faster the speed must be. We know that the speed of an artificial Earth satellite is about eight kilometers per second, which is the so-called first cosmic velocity; and the minimum speed of a probe to the Moon must be more than eleven kilometers per second, which is the second cosmic velocity; to reach the outer planets of the solar system, such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, the speed must be 16.5 kilometers per second, which is the third cosmic velocity. With today's scientific and technological level, to achieve this speed, multi-stage rockets must be used. The initial weight of each lower-stage rocket is ten times the initial weight of its direct upper-stage rocket; the increase in speed that each stage of the rocket can provide is approximately equal to the exhaust velocity of the rocket engine. If ordinary rocket fuel, that is, liquid oxygen and alcohol or liquid oxygen and kerosene, is used, the exhaust velocity is almost 3.8 kilometers per second. Therefore, to achieve the Earth satellite speed of eight kilometers per second, a three-stage rocket must be used for launch. The weight of the first stage rocket is ten times that of the second stage rocket, the second stage is ten times that of the third stage, and the third stage is ten times the weight of the satellite itself. Therefore, launching a one-ton satellite requires about a hundred tons of three-stage rockets. If you want to go to the moon, you need a four-stage rocket with ordinary liquid; and the launch rocket is ten thousand times the weight of the probe. If you want to go near the outer planets of the solar system, a six-stage launch rocket must be used with ordinary fuel; and the total weight of the rocket is one million times the weight of the probe. Therefore, the weight of an unmanned probe to be placed on Neptune must be limited to 50 kilograms, and the weight of the launch rocket must be 50,000 tons.

Therefore, in order for interstellar navigation to take another step forward, we must strive to increase the exhaust velocity of rocket engines as much as possible, to reduce the number of rocket stages, thereby reducing the weight of the launch rocket. For example, assuming that the exhaust velocity can be increased to four kilometers per second, then a two-stage rocket can launch a satellite, and to launch a one-ton artificial Earth satellite, the total weight of the rocket will be reduced to one hundred tons. With the same exhaust velocity, if you want to launch a 50-kilogram probe to the outer planets of the solar system, you only need a 50-ton four-stage rocket. To greatly increase the rocket exhaust velocity, we must use high-energy fuels. For example, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen can achieve the exhaust velocity of four kilometers per second mentioned above. If we can use a high-temperature nuclear fission reactor to heat liquid hydrogen to 3,000 degrees Celsius, then we can get an exhaust velocity of eight kilometers per second. Therefore, with nuclear rockets, one stage can launch an artificial satellite, and two stages can launch probes to any planet in the solar system. These examples illustrate how important it is to increase the rocket exhaust velocity. We must study this issue. In our work on increasing the exhaust velocity, we should consider using free radicals and atomic hydrogen in chemistry. From theoretical calculations, we know that the combination of methylidyne (a compound of one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom) and hydrogen molecules can achieve an exhaust velocity of five kilometers per second; the combination of atomic hydrogen in molecular hydrogen can achieve an exhaust velocity of about eight kilometers per second; and the combination of pure atomic hydrogen can achieve an exhaust velocity of about twenty-two kilometers per second. Naturally, the problem that needs to be solved here is how to stabilize these inherently unstable free radicals and atomic hydrogen; under normal conditions, they will immediately explode through chemical reactions and cannot be stored in fuel tanks. Someone proposed freezing atomic hydrogen in solid molecular hydrogen, wanting to use this method to isolate hydrogen atoms and prevent them from contacting and combining with each other. There are many ideas like this, but whether they are actually feasible remains to be further studied.

Another way to reduce the weight of launch rockets is to study new high-strength materials. If the strength of the material can be increased, then the structure of the rocket body can be made thinner to bear the same load, and if it is thinner, the weight will be smaller. This means that if there are high-strength materials, for the same rocket thrust, the structural weight can be smaller, and the weight of the satellite pushed by the rocket can be correspondingly larger. Conversely, to launch the same satellite, a rocket made of high-strength materials is lighter than a rocket made of ordinary materials. In the numbers we cited earlier, the weight of the next stage rocket is ten times the weight of the previous stage rocket. That is to say, using the materials available today, if the structural weight can be reduced by half using new materials, then the weight of the next stage rocket is only four or five times that of the previous stage. In this case, even with ordinary fuel, launching a 50-kilogram probe to Neptune, a six-stage rocket would be reduced from 50,000 tons to more than 400 tons. What a big change! Can we greatly increase the strength of materials? It should be possible. From the theory of metals, we know that the ideal strength of metals is generally a thousand times the measured strength. The reason why the actual strength does not reach the ideal strength is that real materials are composed of many metal crystals, unlike ideal single crystals; if it is not a single crystal, then there is a layer of adhesive with not very high strength between the crystals, and the overall strength is correspondingly reduced. A more important reason for the low actual strength is the defects in the crystal, which are mainly the "dislocations" of the atomic arrangement in the crystal; with defects, the original strength of the metal cannot be exerted. Not only that, we have also manufactured metals that are basically free of dislocations, and found that their strength is much higher than that of ordinary metals. The problem is that these special products can only be very fine metal "whiskers," not a component. However, this proves that high-strength, dislocation-free metals exist; since they exist, there should be ways to manufacture them. As long as we research and explore, we will definitely find structural materials that exceed the strength of existing materials by dozens or even hundreds of times. This is one of the basic topics for further developing interstellar navigation technology.

However, even with high-energy fuels and atomic hydrogen fuels, and with ultra-high-strength materials, we still cannot really fly out of the solar system to the vicinity of other stars. Using these measures to the top, we can only achieve a speed of about one hundred kilometers per second. At such a speed to other stars, even the closest Proxima Centauri would take more than 10,000 years, which is of course not feasible. We must greatly increase the fuel energy to increase the flight speed by thousands of times. To achieve this goal, not to mention any chemical fuels, even the atomic fuels we know today will not work. What we need is a super fuel, the energy released after its "combustion" should have an associated mass equal to a fraction of the original mass of the fuel, rather than a thousandth of the existing atomic fuels. Some people have also suggested using electrons and positrons as fuel. After the two types of electrons are joined, they will turn into photons and spray out at the speed of light, 300,000 kilometers per second. This is naturally very ideal, but the problem is that we still don't know how to fill a box with electrons and a box with positrons. If we can first use other fuels in the engine to produce energy, and then use the produced energy to manufacture electrons and positrons, then it still boils down to using the energy of the original fuel; if the original fuel is not super, it will still be useless. Therefore, to go to the vicinity of other stars and really make a cosmic flight, we still have to let physicists provide us with super rocket fuel solutions.

Naturally, the technology of interstellar navigation is a very complex problem. The aspects we mentioned above are only prerequisites and are the "vanguards" of interstellar navigation. To really design an interstellar spacecraft requires the cooperation of many other aspects, and there are many difficult problems to be solved. Geophysics, astrophysics, control systems, mechanical design, calculation technology, and radio technology are all components of interstellar navigation. Therefore, the development of interstellar navigation technology must mobilize a vast scientific and technological team, must have careful plans, must have strict organization, and most importantly, must have the support of the people of the whole country and the leadership of the Party. Where else can there be such conditions other than in socialist countries? Therefore, starting from the launch of artificial Earth satellites, then launching probes to the Moon and the planets of the solar system, and then making interstellar travel, and finally breaking through the scope of the solar system and entering the great universe of stars, thereby liberating people from the shackles in space, this is by no means something that can be done in a capitalist system. That will be a contribution made to mankind by the liberated working people in socialist countries. In this great cause, the Soviet Union is the pioneer. Therefore, when commemorating the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, we wish the Soviet people to achieve greater achievements on the basis of their already brilliant achievements and become the pioneers of mankind in entering outer space.

    突破太阳系　飞进大宇宙
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    1957年10月4日，是人类历史上要纪念的一个日子。就在那一天，由于苏联的工人、工程师、科学工作者辛勤的劳动，他们成功地发射了全世界第一颗人造地球卫星。在这约一个月以后，他们又发射了第二颗人造卫星，重量比第一颗更大。而今年5月间，他们发射的第三颗卫星，重量达到了惊人的一千三百二十七公斤。在发射人造地球卫星之前和这几颗卫星发射期间，苏联又放了一连串高空探测火箭。通过这一系列的研究，苏联科学家们阐明了地球周围空间的各种自然现象，以及生物在高空中和失重情况下的生理情况，从而对全世界正在进行的地球物理年研究工作作出了巨大的贡献。更重要的是，由于苏联人民的这些成就，谁也再不能说我们人类的活动范围只限于地球上面了，我们将在不太远的日子里，突破地球本体的小世界，到月亮、到太阳系其他行星上去旅行。这就是说，苏联的劳动人民为人类开辟了星际航行的新时代。
    面临着苏联的伟大成就，美国的统治者们感到威胁，他们所吹嘘的科学技术，现在已经再也吓不倒人了。他们那些放到天上去的“乒乓球”，只能引人发笑。全世界人民都看得清楚，苏联在科学技术方面的水平已经远远超过了美国的水平；而且苏联是从后面赶上来的，一旦超过，以后一定还要更加领先，一直到资本主义灭亡的日子。这一切正说明了社会主义制度的优越性。在社会主义制度下的科学技术，因为有了共产党的领导，它就能以从来没有的高速度向前发展。因此，苏联发射人造地球卫星的胜利就是社会主义的胜利，我们以满怀欢乐的心情来纪念这一个胜利的日子！
    我们也认识到，对整个空间旅行的发展来说，我们今天虽然是走了划时代的第一步，但到底是第一步，今后的工作是巨大和艰难的，需要我们艰苦的奋斗才能逐步实现整个理想。什么是我们的整个理想？整个理想是：从发射人造地球卫星起，再进一步发射没有人的、到月亮上去的测视体；再发射没有人的、到火星和其它太阳系行星上去的测视体。然后，发射带人的地球卫星，并且使人能安全地回到地球上来。有了这些基础，我们就可以考虑到月亮附近去看看，到火星附近去看看；但还不能安全地降落到月亮表面或火星表面，更不能再从月亮或火星安全地回到地球表面上来；那是更进一步的事。要征服太阳系，还得做到能在各个行星或各个行星的卫星上降落，不但能降落而且能再回到地球上来。但是，完全征服了太阳系是不是空间旅行的最终目标呢？不是。这是因为太阳系在整个宇宙里还是十分渺小的，整个银河星系里就有千千万万个其他恒星，也就是千千万万个太阳，有些比我们的太阳还大得多。而且银河星系也不是整个宇宙，银河星系只不过是一个星系体系，在宇宙还有其他星云，还有千千万万个星云体系。不光是太阳多，星云多，而且宇宙间的距离也是惊人的。现在我们所知道的恒星里面，离我们最近的一个比邻星是半人马星座，它离我们的距离，比太阳系约大一万倍。这还是近邻，整个银河系比太阳系自然更大，是太阳系的一亿倍。而这还不过说到千千万万个星云中的一个银河星系，到其它星云上的距离更难以想像了。现在最大的天文望远镜能看到的星云，离我们足有一百万亿亿公里，也就是太阳系大小的一百亿倍！
    越要跑得远，速度也非越快不可。我们知道，人造地球卫星的速度是每秒八公里左右，也就是所谓第一宇宙速度；而要到月亮上去的测视体，最起码的速度也得每秒十一公里多，也就是必须达到第二宇宙速度；要到太阳系的外围大行星像木星、土星、天王星、海王星、冥王星等，就得每秒十六点五公里的速度，也就是第三宇宙速度。以今天的科学技术水平来说，要达到这种运动的速度非用多级火箭不可，而每下一级火箭的初始重量是它直接上一级火箭初始重量的十倍；每一级火箭能增加的运动速度大约等于火箭发动机的喷气速度。如果用普通火箭燃料，也就是液氧和酒精或液氧和煤油，喷气速度差不多是每秒三分之八公里。所以要达到每秒八公里的地球卫星速度就得用一个三级火箭来发射。第一级火箭重量是第二级火箭的十倍，第二级又是第三级的十倍，第三级又是卫星本身重量的十倍。所以放一吨重的卫星就需要大约一百吨重的三级火箭。如果要到月亮上去看看，用普通液体就得用四级火箭；而发射火箭是测视体重量的一万倍。如果要到太阳系外围行星附近去，用普通燃料就非六级的发射火箭不可；而火箭总重量是测视体的一百万倍。因此，要放到海王星上去的无人测视体，就必须能把测视体的重量限制于五十公斤，而发射火箭的重量也得五万吨。
    所以，为了星际航行能够再向前走一步，我们必须努力使火箭发动机的喷气速度尽可能地提高，以减少火箭的级数，从而减轻发射火箭的重量。例如：假设喷气速度能增加到每秒四公里，那么两级火箭就能放卫星，而放一吨重的人造地球卫星，火箭总重量就减到一百吨。用同样喷气速度，如果要发射五十公斤重，到太阳系外围行星去的测视体，只需要五十吨重的四级火箭。要把火箭喷气速度大大提高，我们就得用高能燃料，例如，液氧和液氢就能达到上面所说的每秒四公里的喷气速度。如果我们能够利用高温原子裂变反应堆来把液氢加热到摄氏三千度，那么就能得到每秒八公里的喷气速度。所以，有了原子火箭，一级就能放人造卫星，两级就能放到任何太阳系行星上去的测视体。这些例子说明提高火箭喷气速度是如何重要。我们一定要研究这个问题。在我们研究提高喷气速度的工作中，应当考虑利用化学中的自由基和原子氢。我们从理论计算知道，甲炔基（一个碳原子和一个氢原子的化合物）和氢分子化合就能达到每秒五公里的喷气速度；原子氢在分子氢里化合就能达到每秒约八公里的喷气速度；而纯原子氢化合，喷气速度可以达到每秒约二十二公里。自然，这里需要解决的问题是怎样去稳定这些本来很不稳定的自由基和原子氢；在一般条件下，它们会立刻通过化学反应而产生爆炸，是不能够储藏在燃料箱里的。有人提议把原子氢冻结在固体的分子氢里面，想用这个办法来隔离氢原子，不使它们互相接触而化合。像这一类的想法还很多，但是到底在实际上行得通还是行不通，尚待于进一步的研究。
    另一条减轻发射火箭重量的方法是研究新的高强度材料。如果材料的强度能够提高，那么为承担同一负载，火箭本体结构就可以做得薄一些，薄了重量就会小一些。这也就是说，如果有了高强度的材料，为同一火箭推力，结构重就能小些，相应地也就是火箭所推动的卫星重可以大些。反过来说，放同样的一颗卫星，用高强度材料的火箭要比用普通材料的火箭轻。我们在前面所举的数字说：下一级火箭是上一级火箭重量的十倍，那是说用今天有的材料，如果说用新材料能把结构重量减轻到一半，那么下一级火箭的重量只是上一级的四、五倍，在这种情况下，就是用普通燃料，放一个到海王星上去的五十公斤重的测视体，六级火箭也会从五万吨减到四百多吨。这是多大的一个变化！我们能不能够大大地提高材料的强度呢？应该是可以的。我们从金属的理论知道，一般来说金属的理想强度是实测强度的一千倍。实际强度还达不到理想强度的原故是：真实材料是许多金属晶体所组合成的，不像理想那样的单晶体；不是一个晶体，那么晶体和晶体之间就有了一层强度不太高的粘接物，整体的强度也有相应降低了。实际强度低的更重要原因是晶体之中的缺陷，这种缺陷主要的是晶体中原子排列的“位错”；有了缺陷自然就不能发挥金属本来的强度。不但如此，我们也制造出基本上没有位错的金属，发现他们的强度高出一般金属很多。问题就在于这种特殊制品还只能是非常微细的金属“须”，不成一个构件。但是，这证明高强度的，无位错的金属是存在的；既然存在就应该有办法去制造，只要我们去研究探索，一定可以找到超出现有材料强度几十倍以至几百倍的结构材料。这就是进一步发展星际航行技术的基本课题之一。
    但是，即使有了高能燃料以及原子氢燃料，也有了超强度材料，那还是不能够使我们真的飞出太阳系到其他恒星附近去。用了这些措施就是到顶，我们也只能取得每秒一百公里左右的速度。用这样一个速度到其他恒星上去，就是最近的半人马比邻星也得一万多年，这当然是行不通的。我们必须大大提高燃料能量，使飞行速度提高几千倍。要达到这个目的，不要说任何化学燃料不行，就是用今天我们所知道的原子燃料也不行。我们所需要的是一种超级燃料，它“燃烧”之后所释放出来的能量，其相关联的质量要等于燃料原来质量的十分之几，而不是现有原子燃料的千分之几。有人也提过用电子和正电子作燃料，两种电子接合以后会变成光子，以光速每秒三十万公里的“喷气”速度喷出来。这自然是很理想的，可是问题在于装一箱电子，装一箱正电子，我们还不知道怎么做这件事。如果说我们可以在发动机里先用其它燃料来生产能，再用生产出来的能去制造电子和正电子，那归根还是用原来燃料的能；原来燃料如果不是超级的，也还是无济于事。所以要到其它恒星附近去，真的作一次宇宙飞行，我们还得让物理工作者给我们提供超级火箭燃料方案。
    自然，星际航行的技术是一个很复杂的问题，我们在上面所提的几个方面不过是其中的先决条件，是星际航行的“先行官”。真的设计星际航行船是需要其他许多方面的配合，其中还有很多困难的问题要解决。地球物理，天文物理，控制系统，机械设计，计算技术，无线电技术等都是星际航行的组成部分。所以，发展星际航行技术必须动员一个广大科学技术队伍，必须有周到的计划，必须有严密的组织，而最重要的是必须有全国人民的支持和党的领导。除了社会主义国家，哪儿有这样的条件呢？因此，从发射人造地球卫星开始，进而发射到月亮和太阳系各行星去的测视体，更进而做星际间的旅行，最后突破太阳系的范围，进入恒星的大宇宙，从而解除人们在空间的束缚，这决不是资本主义制度里能够做到的事，那将是社会主义国家里，解放了的劳动人民为人类所做出的贡献。在这一件伟大的事业里，苏联是先行者，所以在纪念苏联发射第一颗人造地球卫星的时候，我们预祝苏联的人民将在已有辉煌成绩的基础上，取得更高的成就，做人类进入宇宙空间的先锋。
