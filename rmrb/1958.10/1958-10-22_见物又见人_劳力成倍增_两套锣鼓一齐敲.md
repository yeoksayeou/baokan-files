	Seeing Both the Object and the People, Labor Increases Exponentially; Playing Two Sets of Gongs and Drums Simultaneously

    This newspaper reports that the Macheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province, while vigorously developing industry, is not relaxing agriculture. It has adopted the method of dividing leadership by battlefront and dividing work by team, promoting the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture, and has already achieved great results.

    The specific practices adopted by Macheng County for dividing leadership by battlefront and dividing work by team are as follows: First, the county party secretary and committee members are divided, with some specializing in industry and some specializing in agriculture. The first secretary mainly manages industry and concurrently manages agriculture. Party committees at all levels below the county party committee also divide their responsibilities according to the above principles. Second, all the labor force in the county is also organized into specialized teams to carry out work according to needs. Out of the county's more than 320,000 male and female laborers, several teams have been formed: those supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel, Daye Steel Plant, and other enterprises; those participating in the county's iron and steel industrial construction; those participating in agricultural construction; and those participating in transportation and other undertakings. The labor force of each people's commune is generally arranged in this way. At the same time, each people's commune can further divide the labor force as needed, such as organizing specialized teams for accumulating fertilizer, specialized teams for deep plowing, specialized teams for rushing to harvest, and specialized teams for water conservancy in agriculture. The above arrangements are basically fixed, but when necessary, industry and agriculture can adopt the method of mutual support for temporary adjustments.

    This method of dividing battlefronts and teams has great benefits for promoting the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture. It can prevent the situation of grasping industry and losing agriculture, or grasping agriculture and losing industry. At the same time, competitions are naturally formed between the various battlefronts and teams, promoting the "satellite" launching in both aspects. For example, from the end of September to the beginning of October, after the industrial front successively launched several "satellites" with daily iron production of 1,000 to 1,800 tons or more, it brought great impetus to the agricultural front. At the winter planting on-site meeting held from October 10th to 12th, people put forward the slogan that agriculture should also launch "satellites." Now, mass movements of accumulating fertilizer, rushing to harvest cotton, and deep plowing land have been launched throughout the county. Many people's communes have harvested cotton, reaching an average of three to four hundred jin (seed cotton) per mu, achieving harvesting as soon as it ripens; the accumulated fertilizer has reached an average of more than six hundred dan per mu, and some brigades and teams have reached one thousand dan per mu. At the same time, water conservancy reconstruction projects have also partially started. The work of crash planting wheat and transplanting rapeseed will also be carried out on a large scale.

    In the past few months, because the Macheng County Committee has paid attention to grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, the county has achieved great results in developing both industry and agriculture. In the industrial sector, before September, the county only produced a few tons of iron per month. Since the end of September, it has been able to produce hundreds of tons of iron every day, and more than one thousand to one thousand eight hundred tons at times. The county's agriculture has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Judging from the already harvested early rice and mid-season rice, the average yield per mu of early rice has increased by more than two times compared to last year, and the yield of mid-season rice has increased by more than one time; from the growth of the unharvested late rice, the possibility of increasing the yield several times compared to last year is also extremely high. The growth of cotton and peanuts this year is particularly good, and it is estimated that the yield per mu of peanuts and cotton will increase by more than two times and three times respectively compared to last year, and a batch of high-yield "satellites" with peanut yields of 30,000 to 40,000 jin per mu and seed cotton yields of 5,000 to 8,000 jin per mu or more will be launched.

    见物又见人　劳力成倍增
    两套锣鼓一齐敲
    本报讯　中共湖北省麻城县委在大抓工业的同时不放松农业，采取分战线领导和分班子工作的办法，促使工农业共同跃进，已经获得了巨大成绩。
    麻城县采取分战线领导和分班子工作的具体作法是：第一，县委书记和委员进行分工，一部分专管工业，一部分专管农业，第一书记则以管工业为主并兼管农业。县委以下的各级党委也都根据上述原则来分管。第二，全县劳动力也根据需要分别组成专门班子来进行工作。全县有男女劳动力三十二万多个，分出：支援武钢、大冶钢厂等企业的，参加本县钢铁工业建设的，参加农业建设的，参加交通运输等事业的几个班子。各人民公社的劳动力一般都照这样来安排。同时，各人民公社还可根据需要对劳动力作进一步的分工，如在农业方面分别组织积肥专业队、深翻地专业队、抢收专业队、水利专业队等。上述安排基本上是固定的，但必要时工农业可采取相互支援的办法临时调剂。
    这种分战线、分班子的作法对促进工农业同时跃进有很大好处。可以防止抓工业，丢农业或抓农业，丢工业的情况出现。同时，各战线、各班子间就自然地形成了竞赛，促使两个方面竞放“卫星”。例如，9月底到10月初，当工业战线连放了几个日产铁一千吨到一千八百吨以上的“卫星”后，就给农业战线带来很大的推动力量，在10月10日到12日召开的冬播现场会上，人们就提出了农业也要放“卫星”的口号。现在，群众性的积肥运动、抢收棉花的运动和深翻土地的运动，都已经在全县掀起。不少人民公社收摘的棉花，已达到平均每亩三、四百斤（籽棉），作到了随熟随收；积的肥料已达到每亩平均六百担以上，部分大队、中队已达到每亩千担。同时，水利回修工程也已经部分动工。突击种小麦和移栽油菜的工作也将大规模地开展起来。
    几个月来，由于麻城县委注意了一手抓工业，一手抓农业，使全县在发展工业和农业方面都获得了巨大的成绩。在工业方面，9月份以前，全县每月才产铁几吨，从9月底以来，每天就能产铁几百吨，多的时候在一千吨到一千八百吨以上。全县农业也是空前大丰收。从已经收割的早稻和中稻来看，早稻平均亩产量比去年增产二倍强，中稻增产一倍强；还未收割的晚稻从生长情况看，将比去年成倍增产的可能性也是极大的。今年棉花和花生的生长情况更是特别好，预计花生和棉花的亩产量将分别比去年增产二倍多和三倍多，并将放出一批亩产花生三万斤到四万斤和亩产籽棉五千斤到八千斤以上的高产“卫星”。　（方堤）
