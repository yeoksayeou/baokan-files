    Creating the newest and most beautiful dramatic art on the basis of tradition
    Ouyang Yuqian
    The excellent tradition of Chinese drama is a tradition full of combativeness – exposing and resisting barbaric rule, unreasonable systems, feudal oppression, cannibalistic ethics, and so on. Its creative and expressive methods combine romanticism and realism. Examples include "The Injustice to Dou E," "Saving the Courtesan," "The Butterfly Lovers," and "Cosmic Beam," as well as plays like "The Generals of the Yang Family" and "Hua Mulan." In "Cosmic Beam," Zhao Yanrong actually dares to resist her father and the emperor, feigning madness to curse in the golden palace, which was impossible in reality at the time. However, the expression of a repressed woman's rebellious emotions is real and powerful. The beauty of art is expressed here. Mu Guiying, a young woman, occupies a mountain stronghold, truly fearless. She disregards the feudal marriage system and chooses her own spouse. Whoever dares to bully her, she beats them to a pulp, even her famous father-in-law, Yang Liulang, is knocked off his horse by her. For the sake of defending the country, she fights for many years, and her whole family suffers great sacrifices. After retiring for twenty years, she bravely takes on the task of fighting again when the foreign invaders encroach on the border. Such a character is rare in feudal society and can be said to be entirely fictional. But the image looks so complete that you can't help but think it's real and credible. Look at the plays "Muke Village" and "Mu Guiying Takes Command," which are indeed healthy, beautiful, lively, and vivid. Not only because of the content, but also because of the forms and methods of expression, these plays can lead the audience to a realm of artistic beauty. There are many examples, but the ones mentioned above can illustrate that the Chinese dramatic tradition is a combatative, excellent tradition combining romanticism and realism. Through the images of the characters, the playwrights expressed the people's aspirations and the progressive ideas of the time. Many plays are revolutionary (of course, if there are poisonous weeds now, it is impossible that there were no dross in feudal-era plays, but the essence is the main thing).
    While inheriting tradition, we should also have new developments on the basis of tradition. Chairman Mao put forward the slogan of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism, opening up a new world in literature and art. Some people say that it is very good to put forward the combination of revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism now, which is applicable to the past, present, and future. I think that although good dramas in the past had a people's nature and revolutionary nature, they are different in nature from today's creative method of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism. Revolutionary realism reflects the revolutionary reality; revolutionary romanticism reflects the revolutionary ideal; the combination of the two is the combination of reality and ideal. The revolutionary ideal is far-reaching, and the revolutionary reality differs with each historical stage. Continuous revolution constantly pushes the real society forward step by step, its progress is getting faster and faster, its scope is getting larger and larger, its vision is getting wider and wider, and its goal is getting more and more far-reaching. From new democracy to socialism to communism, our ideal is to create the greatest happiness for all mankind, to liberate all mankind, and to liberate the universe. The creative method of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism constantly has new content along with the progress of the revolution, and will also constantly have new forms to adapt to the new content. Therefore, the basis of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism is revolutionary practice. Its purpose is to educate the people with a communist worldview, communist spirit, and communist moral qualities.
    Revolutionary realism must write the truth of objective society, which is beyond doubt, but if reality is reflected naturalistically, it will inevitably distort reality. For example, we love peace and oppose war, but we are never afraid of war. If the imperialist aggressors dare to bully us and impose war on us, then we will not hesitate and resolutely give a devastating counterattack. Because peace is not without cost, compromise with aggressors will never achieve peace, but will instead encourage aggression, this is the truth. Our wish and ideal is lasting world peace. But in order to achieve our wish, we must go through a series of serious struggles, which is also the revolutionary reality. Therefore, writing reality cannot be separated from ideals.
    What revolutionary romanticism expresses should be a greater truth, our ideals are not fantasies, they are based on reality. We are carrying out socialist construction at high speed, and we will transition from socialism to communism in the future. Every action of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China shows a great ideal. We propose to solve a certain problem by working hard for a certain period of time. The two words "working hard" can enlighten our deep thinking, because the proposal of these two words means that we will soon overcome all kinds of difficulties, get rid of the poor and blank situation, and establish a better life. Revolutionary romanticism will guide us to always look forward and stride towards a bright and brilliant tomorrow.
    Does revolutionary romanticism only write about tomorrow? I think it mainly writes about today. Without thoroughly understanding today, it is impossible to understand tomorrow. The basis of ideals is today's reality. The sprouts of communism can be seen from agricultural cooperation, the great leap forward in production, and the people's communes. Empty, parrot-like praise is not desirable; arbitrarily drawing up a list of fantasies about the future is also not a solution. Revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism are inseparable.
    In order to reach our ideal world, we must inevitably go through constant and serious struggles. At present, there are contradictions among the people, and there are also serious contradictions between ourselves and the enemy; at the same time, we must also conquer nature, so we feel more deeply that the two words "working hard" have profound significance for us. Although the nature of the contradictions is different, contradictions will always exist, and when contradictions stop, life also stops. Our works must write about contradictions and write about struggles. If not, the works will have no life. The works that combine revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism must be full of combativeness and extremely lively. Such works must dare to establish the opposite side. But writing the opposite side must also be truthful, otherwise it will not be convincing.
    In order to express new content, it is very necessary to choose an appropriate form or create a new form. Choosing a form or creating a form for the sake of content is not equal to formalism. Without a beautiful form, you cannot express beautiful content. While we inherit tradition, we cannot deny that some art forms that we used in the past or even today are not adaptable enough to the current new situation of the great leap forward in production, where ten thousand horses are galloping. Folk songs and farmers' paintings are expressing the heroic spirit of the working people in new forms. What should our drama do? I think we should also use diverse forms to express and spread communist ideas according to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Some people reflect that our spoken drama mostly seems a bit "lukewarm," that is to say, a bit tepid, and looks a bit dull. This criticism deserves our attention. I think it's not that spoken drama is bad, it's that our artistic creative methods in scripts, performances, and directing may have problems. Comrade Cao Yu once told me that he had the same feeling, and he proposed to carry out some reforms. I think our spoken drama should create newer forms of expression on the basis of the tradition of Chinese dramatic art. We must take a big step forward and use the creative method of combining revolutionary romanticism and revolutionary realism to make spoken drama art present a newer look.

    在传统的基础上创造最新最美的戏剧艺术
    欧阳予倩
    中国戏剧的优良传统，是一个富于战斗性的传统——对野蛮的统治、对不合理的制度、对封建压迫、吃人的礼教等等，进行揭露和反抗，而它的创作和表现方法是浪漫主义和现实主义相结合的。像窦娥冤、救风尘、梁山伯与祝英台、宇宙锋，还有像杨家将、花木兰等戏，都是鲜明的例子。宇宙锋里的赵艳容居然能反抗父亲，反抗皇帝，装着疯癫到金殿上去大骂，在当时事实上是不可能的，可是写一个被压迫的女性的反抗情绪，却是真实的、有力的。艺术的美也就表现在这里。穆桂英，一个年青女子占一个山寨，真是天不怕地不怕。她不管封建婚姻制度，自找配偶。谁要敢于欺负她，她就把谁打得落花流水，连她的公公有名的杨六郎也被她打下马来。为着保卫国家多年作战，全家都受到很大的牺牲；她退休之后，经过二十年，为着番邦犯境，她勇敢地再担起战斗的任务。这样的一个人物，在封建社会里是极少见的，可以说完全出于虚构。可是看上去形象是那么完整，不由得你不认为真实可信。请看穆柯寨、穆桂英挂帅这些戏，的确是健康美丽，生动活泼。不仅是由于内容，也由于表现的形式和方法，这些戏能把观众引到一个艺术的美的境界中去。例子很多，单就上面所提的，也就可以说明中国的戏剧传统是战斗的、浪漫主义与现实主义相结合的优良传统。剧作者通过人物的形象，表现了人民的愿望，表现了当时的进步思想，许多戏都是带有革命性的（当然如果现在有毒草，封建时代的戏也不可能没有糟粕，但是精华是主要的。）。
    我们一方面继承传统，一方面在传统的基础上我们还应当有新的发展。毛主席提出了革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合这个口号，在文学艺术方面开辟了新天地。有人说现在提出革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合非常好，既适用于过去，也适用于现在和将来。我认为过去好的戏剧虽有人民性，有革命性，但与今天所提出的革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的创作方法，性质有所不同。革命的现实主义反映的是革命的现实；革命的浪漫主义反映的是革命的理想；两者的结合就是现实与理想的结合。革命的理想是远大的，革命的现实是跟随着每一历史阶段而有所不同的。不断的革命，把现实社会一步一步不断地推着向前，它的进度越来越快，范围越来越大，视野越来越宽广，目标越来越远大，从新民主主义到社会主义到共产主义，我们的理想是要创造全人类最大的幸福，解放全人类，解放宇宙。革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的创作方法，跟随着革命的进展，不断地有新的内容，也就不断地会有新的形式，以适应新的内容。所以革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的基础是革命的实践。它的目的是要以共产主义的世界观，共产主义的精神，共产主义的道德品质教育人民。
    革命的现实主义必须写客观社会的真实，这是不容怀疑的，但如果自然主义地反映现实，必然会歪曲现实。例如我们热爱和平，反对战争，但是决不怕战争。如果帝国主义侵略者敢欺负我们，要把战争强加在我们头上，那我们就毫不犹豫，坚决地给予毁灭性的回击。因为和平不是无代价的，对侵略者妥协绝不能够取得和平，反而会助长侵略，这是真实。我们的愿望和理想是世界的持久和平。但为着达到我们的愿望，必须经过一系列的严重的斗争，这也就是革命的现实。所以写现实也离不开理想。
    革命的浪漫主义所表达的应当是更大的真实，我们的理想不是空想，是有现实根据的。我们正在高速度地进行社会主义建设，将来还要从社会主义过渡到共产主义。中国人民在中国共产党领导之下的每一个行动，都显示着一个伟大的理想。我们提出苦战若干时候解决某一个问题，苦战两个字可以启发我们的深思，因为这两个字的提出，意味着我们很快就要克服种种困难，脱离一穷二白的生活状况，建立起更美好的生活。革命的浪漫主义将指导我们永远向前看，大踏步走向光辉灿烂的明天。
    革命的浪漫主义是不是专写明天呢？我以为主要还是写今天。不彻底理解今天，就无法理解明天。理想的根据是今天的现实。从农业合作化、生产大跃进、人民公社等等就看出共产主义的萌芽。空洞的人云亦云的歌功颂德，不足取；幻想未来随便开张清单也不是办法。革命的浪漫主义同革命的现实主义是不可分割的。
    要达到我们的理想世界，不可避免地要经过不断的严重斗争。现在在我们面前存在着人民内部的矛盾，也存在着严重的敌我矛盾；同时我们还要征服自然，因此更感觉到苦战两个字对我们有深刻的意义。矛盾的性质尽管不同，但是矛盾将永远存在，矛盾停止，生活也就停止。我们的作品必须写矛盾，写斗争。如果不这样，作品也就没有生命。革命的浪漫主义与革命的现实主义相结合的作品，必然是充满着斗争性的、极为生动活泼的。这种作品必然是敢于树立对立面的。但是写对立面也必须是真实的，不然就没有说服力。
    为着表现新的内容，选择一个适当的形式，或者创造一个新的形式，是十分必要的。为着内容选择形式或创造形式并不等于形式主义。没有优美的形式就不能够表达优美的内容。我们一方面继承传统，但是也不能否认，过去甚至于今天我们所用的某些艺术形式，已经不够适应目前万马奔腾的生产大跃进的新形势。民歌和农民的画正以新的形式表现劳动人民豪迈的气概。我们的戏剧应当怎么样？我想也是要根据百花齐放的方针，运用多色多样的形式来表达和传播共产主义思想。有些人反映说，我们的话剧多半显得有些“温”，“温”也就是说有些不冷不热，看起来有些沉闷，这个批评值得我们注意。我想这不是话剧不好，是我们干话剧的在剧本和表演、导演方面的艺术创作方法可能存在着问题。曹禺同志曾经对我说他有同样的感觉，他提出要进行一些改革。我想我们的话剧应当在中国戏剧艺术的传统基础上创造出更新的表现形式。我们要向前跨一大步，用革命的浪漫主义和革命的现实主义相结合的创作方法，使话剧艺术呈现出更新的面貌。
