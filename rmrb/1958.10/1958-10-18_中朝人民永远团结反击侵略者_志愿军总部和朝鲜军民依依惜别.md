Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 17th: The headquarters and directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a grand farewell meeting tonight, bidding farewell to the Korean people in their garrison area with whom they had lived in close intimacy for many years.

In his farewell speech, Volunteer Army Deputy Chief of Staff General Xiao Yingtang, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army headquarters and directly subordinate units, expressed sincere gratitude to the people of the garrison area for their strong support and meticulous care to the Volunteer Army over the years. General Xiao Yingtang said that the location of the Volunteer Army headquarters was where Commander Peng Dehuai commanded the entire army to defeat the American aggressors. Over the years, we have spent war-torn years with our Korean elders, brothers, and sisters, and after the war, we have jointly carried out the labor of peaceful construction and the struggle to maintain the armistice. During these unforgettable years, we have formed close friends in adversity. Your meticulous care and support have become the guarantee for us to achieve victory and complete various tasks.

General Xiao Yingtang said that as we are about to leave, we warn the American aggressors that the Chinese and Korean people love peace. If American imperialism dares to impose war on the people of China and Korea, then the Chinese and Korean people, who are stronger than in the past, will unite closely as in the past and inflict devastating blows on the aggressors.
