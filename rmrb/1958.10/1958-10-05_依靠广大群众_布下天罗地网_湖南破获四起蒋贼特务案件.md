Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 4th -- With the active support of the broad masses and the close cooperation of relevant departments, the Hunan Provincial Public Security Organs recently uncovered four Chiang Kai-shek group's dispatched spy cases in one fell swoop. With the approval of the People's Procuratorate, the spy elements He Difu, Cai Keming, Feng Shibing, and Huang Jun have been arrested according to law, and a large amount of evidence has been seized, crushing the enemy's sinister plots.

He Difu, Cai Keming, Feng Shibing, and Huang Jun were all historical counter-revolutionaries. Before liberation, He Difu participated in the bandit "Fourth Army of the Chinese People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" headed by He Kangmin, attempting to resist the southward advance of our liberation army in the southern Hunan area. Soon, this counter-revolutionary armed force was encircled and annihilated by our army. He Difu escaped and fled to Hong Kong, where he was recruited by the "Intelligence Bureau" of the spy agency. In 1954, he went to Taiwan for "explosives" training, personally trained by American spy instructors. Cai Keming fled to Taiwan with Chiang's army in 1949, and then joined the "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," a Chiang bandit spy agency. He received spy training on Okinawa Island, Japan. This training class was jointly run by Chiang bandit's "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" and the American imperialist "Second Division of the Far East Intelligence Department." Huang Jun and Feng Shibing joined the Chiang bandit "Second Group of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang" spy organization successively, after which American and Chiang spy instructors specially imparted the tricks of concealed sabotage activities.

After being trained, these spy elements were successively dispatched to Hunan Province to carry out espionage and sabotage activities. He Difu lurked in Chen County, attempting to collect remaining counter-revolutionary elements, set up "liaison points," and develop a spy organization. Huang Jun and Feng Shibing lurked in Hengyang, attempting to erect a radio station and establish an "intelligence network" to coordinate with Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "strategic actions." At the same time, they attempted to collect dregs of society, conceal their identities, pretend to be active, and infiltrate our agencies, enterprises, and transportation departments to carry out sabotage, arson, and explosions of our warehouses, bridges, railways, public places, and other buildings. After Cai Keming sneaked into Changde, he tried to gather information about our militia organizations and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to supply to the spy agencies. He also used his identity as a "compatriot returning from Hong Kong and Macau" to go to Wuhan and Beijing, and prepared to "roam" Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Yingtan and other places, attempting to take the method of secretly inquiring along the way, to steal a large amount of important military, political, and economic intelligence of ours, and then sneak back to Hong Kong to report to the enemy spy agencies, and further plot espionage and sabotage activities against the mainland.

    依靠广大群众　布下天罗地网
    湖南破获四起蒋贼特务案件
    新华社长沙4日电　湖南省人民公安机关在广大群众的积极支持和有关部门的密切配合下，最近一举破获了四起蒋介石集团的派遣特务案件。经人民检察院批准，已依法逮捕了特务分子何帝甫、蔡克明、冯时炳、黄俊四犯，缴获了大量罪证，粉碎了敌人的罪恶阴谋。
    何帝甫、蔡克明、冯时炳、黄俊都是历史反革命分子。何犯在解放前夕曾参加以何康民为首的匪“中国人民反共救国军第四军”，妄图在湘南一带抵挡我解放大军南下。不久，这一反革命武装被我军围歼，何犯漏网，逃到香港，由特务机关“情报局”搜罗。1954年到台湾受“爆破”训练，由美国特务教官亲自训练。蔡犯于1949年随蒋军溃逃台湾，随后参加蒋匪特务机关“国防部二厅”，曾在日本冲绳岛受特务训练，这个训练班是蒋匪“国防部二厅”和美帝国主义“远东情报部第二处”合办的。黄、冯两犯先后加入蒋匪“国民党中央委员会二组”特务组织后，由美蒋特务教官专门传授了隐蔽破坏活动的伎俩。
    这些特务分子经过训练后，先后被派遣潜入湖南省进行特务破坏活动。何帝甫潜伏在郴县，企图搜罗残余反革命分子，布设“联络据点”，发展特务组织。黄俊、冯时炳潜伏在衡阳，企图架设电台，建立“情报网”，以配合蒋介石集团所谓“战略行动”，同时企图搜罗社会败类分子，隐瞒身份，伪装积极，以渗入我机关、企业和交通部门，进行行动破坏，纵火和爆炸我仓库、桥梁、铁路、公共场所等建筑物。蔡克明潜至常德以后，多方搜集我民兵组织、镇反运动等情况，供给特务机关。他还利用“港澳回乡同胞”的身份到武汉、北京，并且准备“漫游”南京、上海、杭州、鹰潭等地，企图采取沿途秘密刺探的方法，大量窃取我重要的军事、政治、经济情报，然后潜回香港，向敌特机关汇报，进一步策谋对大陆的特务破坏活动。
