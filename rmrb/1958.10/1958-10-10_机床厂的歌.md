Joy Over Head
　　Wherever you go,
　　You can see joy overhead:
　　News of victory covers the walls,
　　Surpassing the Great Wall by ten thousand miles,
　　The Great Wall of ten thousand miles isn't enough to post it all,
　　Thousands upon thousands of layers stacked up;
　　Stacked up, red to the core.
　　The motherland is in a sea of red light!

The Workers' Hands
　　Round as round can be,
　　Square as square can be,
　　Short as short can be,
　　Long as long can be.
　　With the hands of machine workers,
　　Iron and steel are tamed;
　　With the hands of machine workers,
　　The world will be transformed!

A Flower
　　Ants gnawing at bones—
　　The workers' ambition is great,
　　Made a generator,
　　One thousand five hundred kilowatts,
　　Reported the good news on the spot,
　　Welcomed the Party Secretary to speak,
　　Everyone looked at the Secretary,
　　The Secretary looked at everyone,
　　They had fought hard together for several days and nights,
　　The bloodshot eyes were dense and numerous,
　　In the sound of gongs and drums, he didn't say a word,
　　And put a flower on it with both hands;
　　Everyone said they were dressing up a new bride,
　　Who would be married off tomorrow...

Female Auxiliary Worker
　　Pushing a cart,
　　Holding a shovel,
　　Busy in the workshop,
　　The floor is cleaned and shining,
　　The machine tool also looks good,
　　Iron filings flying under the cutting tool,
　　She treats them all as petals,
　　Carefully sweeping and accumulating them,
　　Not letting a single piece scatter,
　　Sending them back to the furnace for smelting,
　　Her eyebrows smile the most curved:
　　"In this molten iron,
　　There is also a drop of my sweat!"

    机床厂的歌
    梁上泉
  抬头见喜
  无论你走到哪里，
  都能抬头见喜：
  喜报贴满了墙壁，
  超过长城万里，
  万里长城贴不下，
  千层万层重叠起；
  重叠起，红透底。
  祖国就在一片红光里！
  工人的手
  要圆就圆，
  要方就方，
  要短就短，
  要长就长。
  凭着机械工人的手，
  驯服铁和钢；
  凭着机械工人的手，
  要把世界变个样！
    一朵花
  蚂蚁啃骨头——
  工人志气大，
  制成发电机，
  一千五百瓩，
  当场报喜讯，
  欢迎党委书记来讲话，
  大家看书记，
  书记看大家，
  一同苦战了几昼夜，
  眼里的血丝密麻麻，
  锣鼓声中他没开口，
  双手给它插了一朵花；
  都说在打扮新姑娘，
  明天就出嫁……
    女辅助工
  推着小车，
  拿着铁铲，
  忙碌在车间，
  地板打扫得发亮，
  机床也显得好看，
  车刀下铁屑飞溅，
  她都当作花瓣，
  细心地扫积起来，
  不让它抛撒一片，
  送回炉里熔炼，
  她眉毛笑得最弯：
  “在这铁水里，
  也有我的一滴汗！”
