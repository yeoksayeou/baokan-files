Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 7th. "Al-Gomhouria" newspaper today published an editorial on the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" by Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, saying that the whole world welcomes the Chinese government's order to cease shelling for a week.

The newspaper said, "If there is no foreign interference, the Far East problem will be readily solved, because there is no doubt that Taiwan and the coastal islands are an inseparable part of China. In fact, if the Chinese are allowed to solve their own problems, the Far East problem would not arise at all."

A commentator in Cairo's "Al Messa" published a commentary on the 6th saying: China's temporary cessation of shelling Kinmen is to tell Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates not to rely on the United States, and also to give Chiang Kai-shek a chance to negotiate without losing face.

The commentator pointed out that China not only wants to recover Kinmen and Matsu, but also to liberate Taiwan and stop the United States from interfering in China's internal affairs.

    开罗报纸指出
    中国决心制止美国干涉内政
    新华社开罗7日电　“共和国报”今天就中国国防部长彭德怀的告台湾同胞书发表社论说，全世界都欢迎中国政府停止炮击一星期的命令。
    这家报纸说，“如果没有外国干涉，远东问题会迎刃而解，因为没有丝毫疑问，台湾和沿海岛屿是中国不可分割的一部分。事实上，如果让中国人自己去解决他们自己的问题，远东问题就根本不会产生”。
    开罗“晚报”评论员在6日发表评论说：中国暂时停止炮轰金门是为了告诉蒋介石和他的部下不要依赖美国，同时也是为了给蒋介石一个不丢面子的谈判的机会。
    这位评论员指出，中国不仅要收复金门和马祖，而且要解放台湾，制止美国干涉中国内政。
