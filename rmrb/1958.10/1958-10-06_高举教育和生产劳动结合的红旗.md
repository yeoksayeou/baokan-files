    Hold High the Red Flag of Combining Education and Productive Labor
    Secretary of the CPC Nanjing Agricultural College Committee Zhang Weicheng
    On the basis of the basic victory of rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, Nanjing Agricultural College resolutely implemented the policy of combining education and productive labor in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee. Since the comprehensive launch of work-study programs in our college in March, the gains have been very significant. It has begun to change the situation of theory being divorced from practice, production, and the masses, which was caused by the influence of bourgeois educational thought. The mental outlook of teachers and students has been greatly changed, and the school's ethos has been completely renewed.
    Through labor production, the students' ideas of belittling workers, peasants, and labor have been transformed. In the past, the students generally held the view of being fond of ease and aversion to work, and belittling workers and peasants. They were afraid of getting dirty, tired, and suffering. Some people were even unwilling to wash their own clothes. After several months of continuous labor training, their attitude towards labor has changed greatly. One student in the third grade of the agronomy department was afraid of getting dirty and refused to take off his shoes when he first went down to the rice paddies. When he felt unable to operate in the field while wearing shoes, he reluctantly took off his shoes, but did not take off his socks. After a period of labor, when transplanting rice seedlings, he went barefoot into the field with a happy mood. From belittling workers and peasants to becoming friends with workers and peasants, through hard work with peasants and workers, planting crops well, raising fat pigs and cattle, and making products, they developed feelings for production and for workers and peasants. Many students believe that they now have a common language with workers and peasants. They can talk to farmers about the weather, fertilizers, rain, and mechanization in a very harmonious manner.
    Collectivist moral character is gradually growing. In collective labor, in order to improve production efficiency, it is necessary to divide labor and cooperate and give play to collective wisdom. Discipline and organization have been strengthened through production. The quality of labor attitude has become a recognized standard for measuring the moral character of each student. A thrifty and simple lifestyle has gradually formed. In the past, they had to take a car when going out, but now they walk to the streets, carrying luggage and walking ten miles to the farm. In the past, many people hired people to wash clothes, but now they wash their own clothes. In actual labor, they deeply realized the meaning of "who knows that every grain on the plate is hard-earned."
    Physical fitness has been enhanced and diseases have been reduced. From March to June last year, the average daily number of outpatients in the college was 134, which decreased to 58 during the same period this year. Those who had neurasthenia and dizziness in the past have generally improved. From March to June last year, the consumption of tranquilizers and sleeping pills was 100, which decreased to 31.5 during the same period this year. In the animal husbandry class 63, more than a dozen people had various diseases, but now only one person has. Many people could only do half a labor force at the beginning, but now they have become a full labor force. The quality of teaching has been improved and the reform of teaching has been promoted. Through production labor combined with their majors, students have closely integrated theory with practice, consolidated their theoretical knowledge, and learned things that cannot be learned from books. The learning attitude of emphasizing books and not emphasizing practice has greatly changed. When they started to engage in agricultural production labor, some did not know how to hold a hoe, and some transplanted weeds when transplanting cotton seedlings, and when weeding, they hoeed out the seedlings and left the weeds. Those who studied animal husbandry did not recognize the sweet potato leaves for feed. Some professional courses were forgotten after they were taught in the past, but now they can remember them firmly through the practice of production labor. Things that were difficult to understand in the classroom in the past can be solved with a single point after production practice.
    Teachers participated in labor and combined it with practice, encountering many practical problems that could not be solved and could not explain the reasons. Like in the past, simply reading lectures in class, talking about articles, and answering questions abstractly can no longer meet the requirements of students. Therefore, they have to prepare lessons carefully and try to enrich some content that is combined with practice. Some teachers participate in labor with students and go to the field to teach. At the end of each production stage, they summarize production experience with students and workers, which improves the quality of teaching.
    Work-study programs have promoted teaching reform. In terms of teaching content, textbooks have been rewritten, content that is related to China, especially Jiangsu Province, has been added, repetitive content has been deleted, and similar courses have been merged. In terms of teaching attitude, many teachers have changed the bourgeois teaching attitude of only teaching and not educating people in the past and have begun to pay attention to being fully responsible for students and strengthening extracurricular tutoring for students. In terms of teaching methods, not only attention is paid to book teaching, but also guidance from practice is also paid attention to. Teaching is conducted through agricultural and pastoral farms and factories, and problems that occur in production are regularly studied and experiences in production are summarized.
    The combination of teaching and productive labor has promoted scientific research. In the past, scientific research was mostly conducted in greenhouses and laboratories, divorced from actual production. Many topics were fabricated based on personal interests, so no results were obtained. After participating in labor production, various unexpected and urgent new problems that need to be solved are often raised in production. If these problems are not solved in time, they will affect production. These problems naturally become important topics for scientific research. These topics have clear purposes, and after solving them, they immediately play a role in production. For example, when manufacturing bacterial fertilizers, when there were difficulties in obtaining peat raw materials, we studied peat substitutes that are small in volume, high in concentration, and high in efficiency. Therefore, we found that smoked soil and chimney ash can also be used. When promoting bacterial fertilizers, we found that pesticides have different inhibitory effects on bacterial fertilizers. In order to give full play to the role of bacterial fertilizers, we must fully understand the relationship between various commonly used pesticides and bacterial fertilizers, so as to propose reasonable methods for applying bacterial fertilizers when conducting drug treatment in soil or seeds, and further train new strains with strong drug resistance. If we do not contact reality, this type of topic cannot be raised.
    The benefits of implementing work-study programs and combining education and productive labor are very obvious. However, in the process of implementing the combination of education and productive labor, we have not been smooth sailing. Almost at every link, we have experienced a sharp struggle between two roads and two methods. People with bourgeois ideas and conservative ideas clamored that work-study programs disrupted the normal order of regular universities, would reduce the quality of teaching, were too stressful, and difficult to sustain. Students with serious bourgeois ideas believed that "the most unlucky thing is to study agriculture," and individual students even threatened to drop out of school. A student from a landlord family revealed his feelings during a heart-to-heart talk: "I hate it, I'm afraid of it, and I can't do anything about it!" We were not shaken by this resistance and clamoring, but carried out an irreconcilable struggle with them, always putting politics in command and rectification as the key, grasping ideological leadership, and seizing key issues, such as the ratio of teaching and labor time, to conduct major debates. After careful accounting, we completely combined teaching internships and production internships with labor, appropriately reduced the repetitive parts in theoretical courses, so that most majors had one-third of their time participating in labor. On this basis, we formulated specific implementation methods, included production labor in the education plan, and resolutely implemented it vigorously. Through the double-anti and heart-to-heart movement, we deeply exposed and criticized bourgeois ideas, supported the advanced, promoted achievements, praised the spirit of those who agreed with and resolutely implemented work-study programs, and extinguished the evil wind of resistance and skepticism. We always pay attention to grasping the ideological changes of teachers and students, seeing the essence and mainstream, grasping the main problems, mobilizing the masses, conducting debates, and guiding them along the way. Facts have proved that we must resolutely struggle against all kinds of bourgeois ideas that resist the combination of education and productive labor. The more timely the criticism, the deeper the debate, and the more resolute the counterattack, the smoother the development of the work.
    At the same time, the organization work must keep up. The combination of education and productive labor and work-study programs is a specific and complex organizational work. We must strengthen organizational leadership in order to ensure that it is carried out in an orderly manner while rectification, teaching, and production labor are very stressful. There are three central links to doing a good job in organizational leadership: First, under the direct leadership of the college party committee and the college administration, establish a special office to carry out daily work, and establish a set of labor organizations from top to bottom. Second, regularly investigate and understand the employment situation of various units, and arrange and organize the allocation of labor. Third, keep abreast of changes in the situation at any time, temporarily organize necessary changes, and properly arrange teaching and production labor.
    In these works, we must also adjust various contradictions in a timely manner. We have focused on resolving the following contradictions. The problem of combining production labor with majors. In terms of teaching, it is hoped that the labor projects are as consistent as possible with the nature of the majors, and it is also hoped to do technical labor. However, due to the limitations of the type of work and the capacity of the production unit, it is impossible to fully meet this requirement. The solution we have adopted to this contradiction is: the first and second grades mainly learn basic courses, and labor production also participates in general industrial and agricultural production and does odd jobs. Where it is needed, it is sent to where it is needed. The third grade should try to fully combine with the major for production labor. The fourth grade generally goes to agricultural cooperatives and state-owned farms to participate in labor.
    The issue of decentralized labor and centralized labor. In terms of time arrangement, from the perspective of teaching, it is required to be carried out in a decentralized manner throughout the year, so that the entire production process can be seen. In terms of work operation, it is required to rotate regularly, so that practical knowledge of all aspects of production can be learned. However, from the perspective of production, the production unit requires work to be allocated according to its own needs. The time spent on labor each time should be long and fixed, so that it can be operated proficiently and the quality can be guaranteed. The solution to this contradiction is: the labor of the first and second grades should be relatively fixed, but the entire labor process should have a certain rotation. The third grade should spend more than half a year participating in an entire production process.
    The issue of teaching and labor arrangements. Teaching requires a relatively stable plan, attending classes on time, and laboring on time. However, production, especially agricultural production, is often affected by climatic conditions and seasonal changes, and the need for labor also changes from time to time. Therefore, the time for labor and classes that have already been arranged must also be changed accordingly. To solve this contradiction, first of all, teachers and students must realize ideologically that certain temporary adjustments to the courses that have been arranged are inevitable, and they must be prepared ideologically at any time. If the weather is rainy for a long time, classes will be held, and if production is urgently needed, classes will be suspended. Teachers should always pay attention to preparing lessons. In terms of organization, we should try to dispatch in a timely manner, make proper arrangements, and arrange labor time according to the general laws of agricultural production.
    The above are the main gains and experiences of Nanjing Agricultural College in implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor and implementing work-study programs. It should be noted that these are only the beginning, and there are still some shortcomings in the work, which require us to continue to work hard and resolutely and comprehensively implement the wise education policy put forward by the Party Central Committee. Starting from this semester, all teachers and students in the college are carrying out teaching reform while working. Our college has moved from Nanjing City, which is separated from farmers and fields, to the suburbs, which are closer to rural areas. According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, from this semester, in addition to some teachers and students continuing to run their own factories, farms, and other production and continue to study in the school, most of the teachers and students will go to rural areas to go deep into agricultural cooperatives and people's communes to engage in productive labor.
    In the future, we must hold high the red flag of combining education and productive labor, thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois educational thought, and boldly and conscientiously carry out teaching reform. Adopt a revolutionary spirit, fundamentally reform the curriculum content, and use the cutting-edge experience of agricultural and animal husbandry production in our province and the whole country as the central content of the curriculum, and explain it theoretically. Combine with doing a good job in cutting-edge production, conduct comprehensive research, and formulate specific research projects on the high-yield experiences created by the masses in the Great Leap Forward and the problems that urgently need to be solved in current agricultural production, and conduct research carefully, so as to promote the development of teaching and scientific research. We have the confidence and determination to transform Nanjing Agricultural College into a truly communist university.

    高举教育和生产劳动结合的红旗
    中共南京农学院委员会书记　张维城
    南京农学院在整风和反右斗争取得基本胜利的基础上，按照党中央和江苏省委的指示，坚决地贯彻执行了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针。从3月开始，我院全面开展勤工俭学以后，收获非常显著，开始改变了在资产阶级教育思想影响下，造成的理论脱离实际，脱离生产，脱离群众的局面，大大地改变了师生的精神面貌，学校的风尚焕然一新。
    通过劳动生产，改造了学生轻视工农和劳动的思想。过去学生中好逸恶劳，轻视工农的观点是普遍的，怕脏、怕累、怕苦，有些人连自己的衣服都不肯洗。经过几个月连续的劳动锻炼，对劳动的态度，有了很大的变化。农学系三年级有一个学生，开始下秧田的时候，怕脏不肯脱鞋。在田里劳动穿着鞋感到无法操作时，勉强脱了鞋，但不脱袜子。经过一段时间的劳动，下田插秧时，赤脚下田，心情愉快。由轻视工农到与工农为友，经过与农民、工人一起辛勤劳动，种好了庄稼，养肥了猪、牛，制出了产品，对生产有了感情，对工农也有了感情。许多学生认为现在与工农有了共同语言，和农民一块谈天气、肥料、雨水、机械化等，都谈得很融洽。
    集体主义道德品质逐步成长。在集体劳动中，为了提高生产效率，必须分工协作，发挥集体智慧，通过生产加强了纪律性、组织性。劳动态度的好坏，已经成为衡量每个学生道德品质的公认的标准。勤俭朴素的生活作风逐渐形成。过去出门就要坐车，现在都是步行上街，背着行李走十里路下农场。过去许多人都是雇人洗衣服，现在都是自己洗，在实际劳动中深刻体会到“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”的意义。
    增强了体质，减少了疾病，去年3月到6月全院每天平均门诊134人次，今年同一时期减少到58人次。凡是过去有神经衰弱、头晕目眩的人，普遍好转，去年3月到6月，服用镇静剂和安眠药的消耗量为100，今年同一时期减少为31.5。畜牧63班，原有十几人有各种疾病，现在只有一人。许多人开始时只能顶半个劳动力，现在已经成为一个全劳动力了。提高了教学质量，促进了教学革新。学生通过与专业结合的生产劳动，理论与实际紧密结合，巩固了理论知识，学到了书本上所学不到的东西，只重书本，不重实际的学习态度，有了很大的转变。开始从事农业生产劳动时，有的不会拿锄头，有的移棉苗把杂草移上，锄草时，锄掉苗、留下草。学畜牧的不认识饲料山芋叶。过去有些专业课，讲过以后就忘了，现在通过生产劳动的实践，就能牢牢地记住。过去在课堂上难以理解的东西，经过生产实践，一点即破。
    教师参加了劳动、结合实际，碰到许多实际问题解决不了，说不出道理。像过去那样，在课堂上念念讲义，讲讲条文，抽象地回答问题，已经不能满足学生的要求。于是不得不认真备课，尽量充实一些结合实际的内容，有些教师和学生一起参加劳动，到场里去教学，每告一个生产段落便和学生、工人一道总结生产经验，这就提高了教学质量。
    勤工俭学推动了教学革新。在教学内容上，重编教材，增添联系中国尤其联系江苏省生产实际的内容，删减重复的内容，裁并雷同的课程。在教学态度上，许多教师转变了过去只管教书不管教人的资产阶级教学态度，开始注意对学生全面负责，加强对学生的课外辅导。在教学方法上，不仅注意书本教授，也开始注意从实践中进行指导，通过农、牧场和工厂的现场进行教学，定期研究生产中所发生的问题和总结生产中的经验。
    教学与生产劳动相结合，推动了科学研究。过去搞科学研究，大都是在温室和试验室里脱离生产实际进行的。许多题目凭个人兴趣虚构，因此得不到成果。参加劳动生产以后，生产中经常提出各种想不到的迫切需要解决的新问题，如不及时解决，就影响生产。这些问题，很自然的成了科学研究的重要题目。这些题目，目的明确，解决之后，马上对生产就起作用，如制造细菌肥料，在泥炭原料发生困难时，就研究体积小，浓度大，效力高的泥炭代用品，因而发现熏土、烟囱煤灰也能应用。推广细菌肥料时，发现农药对细菌肥料有不同的抑制作用，为了充分发挥细菌肥料的作用，就必须充分了解各种常用的农药对细菌肥料的关系，从而确定在土壤或种子进行药剂处理时，提出合理地施用细菌肥料的方法，并进一步驯育出耐药性强的新菌种。如不接触实际，这类题目就不可能被提出。
    实行勤工俭学，教育和生产劳动相结合，它的好处是很明显的。然而，我们在实行教育和生产劳动结合的过程中，却不是一帆风顺的，几乎在每一个环节上，都经历了两条道路和两种方法的尖锐斗争。有资产阶级思想和保守思想的人叫嚷：勤工俭学搞乱了正规大学的正常秩序，会降低教学质量，太紧张，难以持久。有严重资产阶级思想的学生认为“天下最倒霉的是学农”，个别学生甚至以退学相威胁。一个地主阶级家庭出身的学生，交心时道出他的心情是：“又恨、又怕、又没有办法！”我们没有为这种抵抗和叫嚷所动摇，而是和它们进行了不调和的斗争，始终以政治挂帅、整风为纲，抓紧思想领导，抓住关键性的问题，如教学和劳动时间比例，进行大辩论。经过算细账，把教学实习和生产实习完全与劳动结合起来，适当削减理论课中的重复部分，使大部分专业都有三分之一时间参加劳动。在此基础上，拟制出具体实施办法，把生产劳动列入教育计划，大张旗鼓地坚决加以贯彻执行。通过双反和交心运动，深入揭露和批判资产阶级思想，支持先进，发扬成绩，长赞成并坚决执行勤工俭学的人的志气，灭抵抗派和怀疑派的歪风。随时注意掌握师生的思想变化，看清本质和主流，抓住主要问题，发动群众，进行辩论，顺水推舟，循势利导。事实证明对形形色色抗拒教育和生产劳动相结合方针的资产阶级思想，必须予以坚决的斗争，批判的越及时，辩论得越深透，回击的越坚决，工作的发展越顺利。
    与此同时，组织工作要紧紧跟上。教育和生产劳动相结合、勤工俭学是一个具体而复杂的组织工作。必须加强组织领导，才能在整风、教学和生产劳动都很紧张的情况下，保证有条不紊，有秩序地进行。做好组织领导的中心环节有三个：第一，在院党委和院行政的直接领导下，建立起专门的办事机构，进行日常工作，并自上而下的建立起一套劳动组织。第二，经常调查了解各单位用工情况，安排和组织劳动力的调配。第三，随时掌握情况的变化，临时组织必要的变动，并将教学和生产劳动加以妥善的安排。
    在这些工作中，还要及时调节各种矛盾。我们曾着重解决了这样几个矛盾。生产劳动与专业的结合问题。教学上希望劳动项目与专业性质尽量一致，并且都希望做有技术性的劳动。但由于受工种和生产单位容量的限制，不可能完全满足这个要求。我们解决这个矛盾所采取的办法是：一、二年级主要是学基础课，而劳动生产也是参加一般性的工农业生产及做零杂工，哪里需要，就派到哪里。三年级尽量做到完全结合专业进行生产劳动。四年级一般到农业社和国营农场参加劳动。
    分散劳动和集中劳动的问题，在时间的安排上，从教学上着眼，要求全年分散进行，可以看到整个生产过程。工种操作上要求定期轮流，可以学到生产各方面的实际知识。而生产单位从生产着眼，要求按照本身需要分配工作，每次参加劳动的时间要长，且要固定，才能操作熟练，保证质量。解决这一矛盾的办法是：一、二年级的劳动要比较固定，但整个劳动过程，要有一定的轮换。三年级都要用半年以上时间，参加一个整个生产过程。
    教学与劳动安排问题。教学上要求计划较稳定，按时上课，按时劳动。而生产上，尤其是农业生产上，常受气候条件和季节变化的影响，对劳动力的需要也时有变动，因而已经安排的劳动和上课的时间也必须做相应的变动。解决这一矛盾，首先使师生从思想上认识到，对已安排好的课程，做某些临时性的调动是不可避免的，必须随时作好思想准备。遇到天气久雨，就要上课，遇到生产急需，就要停课。教师随时注意备课。在组织上尽量做到及时调度，妥善安排，并根据农业生产一般规律，安排劳动时间。
    以上就是南京农学院在执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，实行勤工俭学方面的主要收获和体会。应当说明，这些都仅仅是开始，工作上也还存在某些缺点，需要我们继续努力，坚决地全面地贯彻党中央所提出的英明的教育方针。从本学期开始，全院师生，正一面劳动一面进行教学革新。我院已经从和农民、田间分离的南京城内，迁到比较接近农村的郊区。根据中央和省委的指示，从本学期起除一部分师生在校继续搞好自己经办的工厂、农场等生产和继续进行学习外，大部分师生即将分赴各地农村深入农业社和人民公社从事生产劳动。
    今后我们要更高的举起教育和生产劳动相结合的红旗，彻底肃清资产阶级教育思想的影响，大胆地认真地进行教学革新。采取革命的精神，根本改革课程内容，以本省和全国农、牧业生产尖端经验做为课程的中心内容，并提高到理论上加以阐明。结合搞好尖端生产，进行综合研究，对群众在大跃进中所创造的高产经验和当前农业生产迫切需要解决的问题拟定具体研究项目，认真进行研究，以推动教学和科学研究的发展。我们有信心有决心把南京农学院改造成为一所名副其实的共产主义大学。
