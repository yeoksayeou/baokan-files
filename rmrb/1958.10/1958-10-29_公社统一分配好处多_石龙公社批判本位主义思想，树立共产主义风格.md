Public Commune Unified Distribution Has Many Advantages
    Shilong Commune Criticizes Localism, Establishes Communist Style

    Editor's Note: Regarding the distribution issue in people's communes, all that can be uniformly distributed by the commune should be carried out at the commune level. The benefits of doing so are: it is conducive to internal unity within the commune, gradually balances the living standards of members, and lays the foundation for future distribution work. If uniform distribution is difficult, distribution can still be carried out at the original agricultural cooperative level.

    (Our Report) The Shilong People's Commune in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, recently launched a major debate on "Is unified late-season crop distribution better, or is small cooperative distribution better?" They criticized the localist thinking that unified distribution is "rich cooperatives emptying their pockets to support poor cooperatives" and established a communist style of serving everyone. The original seventy-four small cooperatives unanimously supported the commune's unified distribution of this year's late-season crop.

    On October 2, the Shilong People's Commune convened a meeting of 826 member representatives (mostly cadres above the level of team leader from the original agricultural cooperatives) to discuss the distribution of this year's late-season crop. During the discussion, thirteen of the original small cooperatives with better economic foundations disagreed with the implementation of unified distribution. While they acknowledged that the commune must implement unified distribution, they felt it was happening too quickly and that leveling with poor cooperatives all at once was unreasonable, saying it was "rich cooperatives supporting poor cooperatives."

    The Commune Party Committee first pointed out to the representatives that, after implementing unified distribution this autumn, the superiorities of the commune could be immediately realized because the capital and labor of each small cooperative could be immediately turned over and used uniformly. According to preliminary calculations, concentrating the existing capital and labor of the small cooperatives for industrial development alone would generate an income of 1.71 million yuan from now until next spring. If the income from animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fisheries, orchards, etc., is included, the increase in income this winter and next spring could reach more than 6.34 million yuan, averaging 481 yuan per household, far exceeding the income of the currently "wealthy" small cooperatives. Then, the representatives debated the question of "Is it good for the commune for the small cooperatives to be responsible for their own profits and losses?" The debate demonstrated that the method of being responsible for one's own profits and losses not only fails to promote the development of commune production but also adversely affects production. The most obvious example is that if each small cooperative distributes independently this autumn, there will be no way to concentrate a large amount of capital to purchase fish fry next spring. In that case, the river channel of Shilong Guayingzhou (place name) will be wasted for another year and cannot be used for fish farming. The commune's income of hundreds of thousands of yuan would be lost. Distribution by small cooperatives is even more harmful than beneficial to current production. Originally, Shilong Township (the original large township) had already been allocated hundreds of dan of chemical fertilizer. Some cooperatives urgently needed fertilizer to rescue third-class rice seedlings but did not have the money to buy it; other cooperatives did not need fertilizer but had cash on hand. If unified distribution is implemented, with flexible capital turnover, the problem can be solved immediately. Regarding the allocation of labor, some representatives pointed out that if small cooperatives distribute separately, they will inevitably focus solely on increasing the income of their own late-season crops and will be unwilling to allocate manpower to the commune for production, making it difficult for the commune to develop resources and industry on a large scale. For example, Zengbu and Chaolang small cooperatives in Chashan Township have a large amount of refractory clay, which urgently needs to be mined. If the distribution is decentralized, the number of people mining can only be limited to the current three hundred.

    Since unified distribution of the late-season crop has such great advantages, why do some people say that it is "rich cooperatives supporting poor cooperatives?" The representatives analyzed that this is entirely due to localist thinking. For example, Tang Lingen, the financial director of the Tanghong small cooperative, believed that their late-season crop could generate an average income of 224 yuan per person, saying that unified distribution was obviously "suffering a loss." However, the cadres of the Zhongcun small cooperative immediately revealed that they had tried to take advantage of the decentralized distribution to divide up all accumulated funds. If every small cooperative did this, what would the commune rely on to expand production? How can we speed up the construction of socialism and transition to communism?

    With everyone's criticism and help, these cadres' localism went bankrupt. They said: Now it seems that it is not a question of suffering a loss or not, but a question of whether or not we have a communist style. The vast majority of the representatives who originally had resistance to unified distribution had their thinking clarified and wrote letters of determination to support unified distribution.

    公社统一分配好处多
    石龙公社批判本位主义思想，树立共产主义风格
    编者按　人民公社的分配问题，凡是可以由公社统一分配的，都应该以公社为单位统一进行分配。这样做的好处是：有利于公社内部的团结，使社员的生活水平逐步趋于平衡，也给今后的分配工作打下了基础。如果统一分配有困难，也可以仍按原农业社为单位进行分配。
    本报讯　广东省东莞县石龙人民公社最近开展了一场“晚造统一分配好，还是小社分配好”的大辩论，批判了所谓统一分配是“富社掏腰包养穷社”的本位主义思想，树立了我为人人的共产主义风格，原来七十四个小社一致拥护今年晚造由公社统一分配。
    10月2日，石龙人民公社召开了有八百二十六人参加的社员代表大会（绝大部分是原来各农业社的队长以上的干部），讨论今年晚造分配问题。在讨论这个问题的时候，有十三个原来经济基础较好的小社都不同意实行统一分配。他们虽然承认公社必须实行统一分配，但又认为实行得太快了，一下子和穷社拉平太不合理，说这是“富社养活穷社”。
    公社党委会首先向到会代表们指出，今秋实行统一分配后，由于各小社的资金和劳力可马上统一周转使用，公社的优越性就可以立刻发挥出来。根据初步计算，把各小社目前现有的资金和劳动力集中使用起来，单是发展工业一项，从现在起到明春就可收入一百七十一万元，如果连畜牧业、副业、渔业、果园等的收入计算在内，今冬明春可增加收入达六百三十四万多元，平均每户收入达四百八十一元，比目前“富裕”的小社收入要多得多。接着，代表们就“小社各负盈亏到底对公社好不好”的问题开展辩论。辩论说明，采取各负盈亏办法，不但不能促使公社生产发展，而且还会使生产受到不良的影响。最明显的是，如果今秋各小社自行分配，明春就没法集中大量资金去购买鱼苗，这样，石龙挂影洲（地名）的河道还要白白荒废一年，不能养鱼。公社数十万元的收入将成泡影。由小社自行分配对目前生产来说，更是害多益少。本来石龙乡（原来大乡）已分配到数百担化肥，有些社正需要肥料抢救三类禾，但没有钱买；有的社不需要肥料，却存有现金。如果实行统一分配，资金灵活周转，问题就可马上解决。在劳动力调配方面，有些代表们指出，如果小社各自分配，势必造成光为小社晚造增加收入打算，而不肯抽出人力给公社搞生产，公社要大规模地开发资源发展工业就有困难。例如茶山乡的增埗、超朗等小社有大量的耐火坭，目前迫切需要组织人力开挖，若是分散分配，采坭人数只能限于目前的三百人。
    晚造统一分配既然有这样大优越性，为什么有人又说是“富社养穷社”呢？代表们分析说，这完全是一种本位主义思想作怪。例如，唐洪小社的财经主任唐林根认为他们晚造平均每人可以收入二百二十四元，说统一分配明明是“吃亏”。可是，中村小社的干部就马上揭露他们曾经企图乘分散分配把积累分光吃光。要是每个小社都这样做，公社靠什么来扩大生产？怎能加快速度建设社会主义，向共产主义过渡？
    在大家的批评帮助下，这些干部的本位主义破产了。他们说：现在看来不是什么吃亏不吃亏的问题，而是有没有共产主义风格的问题。原来对统一分配有抵触情绪的代表，绝大多数人打通了思想，纷纷写决心书拥护统一分配。
