The President Picked the Wrong Historical Site
　　Shi Lü

　　The time was September 26th of this year, the place a small town in Pennsylvania, USA, difficult to find on a general American map – Ligonier. Though it was drizzling that day, still some ten thousand people gathered outdoors. Adult men wore the uniforms of the 18th-century British colonial army, with red coats and tight white trousers, swords at their waists; children had red paint on their faces and hands, disguised as Indians. Among the crowd were also real Indians brought in from elsewhere. The scene before them was the kind of wooden stockade often seen in American "Western" movies.

　　What was this all about? One might think that Hollywood was filming another "Western" movie about white "heroes" slaughtering red-skinned Indians! However, that was not the case. Because the central figure that this group of people was focused on was not wearing that antique red coat, he was wearing modern clothes, and he could not be mistaken for a movie actor; this group of people was not dressed up for filming, but to listen to his speech, to create an atmosphere for his speech. This central figure was none other than the current President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

　　To put it plainly, the matter is like this:

　　Eisenhower-Dulles' policy of war adventure does not have the support of the American people, a fact that clearly worries some people in the United States. They suddenly came up with a whimsical idea, trying to use the ancestral "Western" spirit of adventure to stir up the American people's ambition to "die on the battlefield." Moreover, they discovered that the town of Ligonier was once a small military fortress during the early days of the United States' "westward expansion," and this year marks the bicentennial of the fort's construction. Thus, the town of Ligonier was restored to its old appearance of Fort Ligonier, and the local residents were ordered to wear the clothes of two hundred years ago to strengthen the atmosphere of the "Western" spirit of adventure, and Eisenhower was invited to attend the bicentennial celebration of the fort's construction.

　　Eisenhower, of course, would not easily let go of such a great opportunity to instill the spirit of adventure into the American people. Isn't he pursuing a policy of provoking the 600 million Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait region, engaging in the greatest adventure in the history of American imperialism? Isn't he in a dilemma because the American people are vehemently opposing this great adventure? Doesn't he need to drive the American people onto the tiger's back with him to take the risk together? Therefore, despite his busy schedule, and being only able to stay in Ligonier for eighteen minutes, he still braved the rain and rushed from Washington to Ligonier.

　　In his speech, Eisenhower vigorously promoted the behavior of Americans during the "westward expansion" period, praising how they "moved forward in groups in adventurous undertakings," "not deterred by unpredictable terrors, not bowing to tension and poverty," and finally "built a great country on the vast wilderness." Needless to say, he would not mention that such a "great country" was established by expelling the local Indians using the most barbaric and brutal methods. Indeed, it would be out of place to mention uncivilized things in this speech promoting the American people's God-given mission to spread "civilization" to the world – for example, burning Indians alive, offering rewards for scalping Indians, etc. – of course, it is best not to mention them. He called on the American people to "fully understand that adventure is always inseparable from progress and glory," just like their ancestors, and to "resolutely endure the current sacrifices to realize a bright future." He also declared, drawing parallels between the past and the present: just as Fort Ligonier was an advanced base for "free life" in those years, today's American military bases overseas are also for "defending freedom." Of course, needless to say, he self-righteously added a tail: "We are not seeking more territory, nor are we seeking any selfish interests."

　　Everything seemed seamless. What should be praised was praised, what should be promoted was promoted, what should be defended was defended, and the words that should be used, such as "freedom," "confidence," and "God," were also used as usual. However, Eisenhower still slipped up. When he set off from Washington, he forgot to check history and find out the origin of Fort Ligonier!

　　It turned out that Fort Ligonier was a military stronghold established by British colonialists two hundred years ago in order to compete with French colonialists for the American colony. So, the problem arises: what is there to be proud of for the American people today in such an aggressive stronghold established by the British, aimed at enslaving the American people of that time? Such a base of enslavement is fundamentally incompatible with the so-called "free life," and today's Americans are celebrating its bicentennial, isn't this a great irony to the history of America's resistance to Britain and striving for independence? Eisenhower compared today's American military bases overseas with Fort Ligonier two hundred years ago with relish, which is indeed a good comparison, because he is admitting, without being told, that those military bases are like Fort Ligonier, aggressive strongholds set up by aggressors on the territory of other countries. The lie of "defending freedom" is shattered without being struck!

　　Those in America who are keen to involve the American people in the whirlpool of adventure have painstakingly tried to find a "historical site" symbolizing "free life" and "defending freedom" in order to take the opportunity to promote the ancestral "Western" spirit of adventure, and to deceive the American people into supporting the Eisenhower-Dulles policy of war adventure, but ended up picking the wrong "historical site," finding Fort Ligonier, which in the eyes of the American people can only symbolize colonial enslavement and aggression! The proponents of war adventure wanted to fool the American people, but exposed their own ignorance and stupidity! (Attached picture)

    总统找错了古迹
    施旅
    时间是今年9月26日，地点是美国宾夕法尼亚州的一个在一般的美国地图上难以找到的一个小镇——里戈尼尔。这一天虽然下着毛毛雨，仍然有一万来人麕集户外。成年的男人们穿着十八世纪英国殖民军队的军服，上身是大红袍，下身是裹得紧紧的白长裤，腰悬军刀；孩子们的脸上和手上都涂了红颜色，化装成印第安人。在人群中还有从别的地方运来的真正印第安人。眼前的景物则是在美国的“西部”影片中所常看到的那种木寨子。
    这是干什么呢？人们或许以为这是好莱坞电影公司又在拍摄一部关于白种“英雄”把红种印第安人杀得人仰马翻的“西部”影片了吧！然而，不是的。因为这一群人所注目的中心人物，并没有穿上那种古色古香的大红袍，他是穿着现代的服装，他不可能被错认为是一位电影演员；这一群人化了装不是为了拍电影，而是为了听他的演说，为了替他的演说烘托气氛。这个中心人物不是别人，正是当今美国的总统艾森豪威尔。
    把闷葫芦打开，事情就是这样：
    艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的战争冒险政策得不到美国人民的支持，这一事实显然引起了美国有些人的忧虑。他们忽然异想天开，想出了用祖传的“西部”冒险精神来激起美国人民“马革裹尸”的壮志这一条奇计。并且，他们发现了里戈尼尔这个小镇在美国建国初期的“向西扩展运动”中曾经是一个小小的军事碉堡，而今年适逢建堡二百周年纪念。于是，里戈尼尔镇就被恢复成当年里戈尼尔堡的老样子，当地的居民就被命令穿上二百年前的服装，以加强当年的“西部”冒险精神的气氛，艾森豪威尔也就被请来出席建堡二百周年庆祝大典。
    有这样一个向美国人民灌输冒险精神的大好机会，艾森豪威尔当然是不会轻易放过的。他不是正执行着在台湾海峡地区向六亿中国人民挑衅的政策，进行美帝国主义有史以来最大的冒险吗？他不是正为美国人民的纷纷反对进行这场大冒险而骑虎难下吗？他不是正需要把美国人民也赶上虎背同他一起去冒险吗？因此，尽管他事情繁忙，只能在里戈尼尔停留十八分钟，他仍然冒雨从华盛顿赶到里戈尼尔去了。
    在演说中，艾森豪威尔极力宣扬了“向西扩展运动”时期的美国人的行为，赞美他们如何“在冒险事业中结伙前进”，“不为不能预卜的恐怖所吓退，不向紧张和贫困低头”，终于“在辽阔的原野上建设了一个伟大的国家”。不用说，他是不会提到这样的“伟大的国家”是通过用最野蛮、最残暴的办法驱逐当地的印第安人而建立起来的。的确，在这篇宣扬美国人有天赋使命到全世界去散播“文明”的演说里提到那些不文明的事情——譬如说，把印第安人用火活活烧死，悬赏活剥印第安人的头皮，等等——毕竟是杀风景的，当然以不提为好。他号召美国人民要像他们的祖先一样地“充分了解冒险总是同进步和光荣形影不离的”，“要坚决承受目前的牺牲以实现将来的光明前途”。他还引古喻今地宣称：正像当年的里戈尼尔堡是“自由生活”的前进基地一样，今天美国在海外的军事基地也是为了“保卫自由”。当然也不用说，他自作聪明地带上了一条尾巴：“我们不是为了寻求更多的领土，也不是为了任何自私的利益”。
    一切似乎都天衣无缝。该赞美的赞美了，该宣扬的宣扬了，该辩护的辩护了，该用的词藻如“自由”、“信心”、“上帝”等等，也都照例沿用了。可是，艾森豪威尔还是露出了马脚。他在华盛顿动身的时候，忘了查一查历史，弄清楚里戈尼尔堡的来历！
    原来，里戈尼尔堡是英国殖民主义者在二百年前为了同法国殖民主义者争夺美国这块殖民地而建立的一个军事据点。于是，问题就来了：像这样一个由英国人建立起来的，目的在于奴役当年的美国人民的侵略据点，对今天的美国人民，又有什么可引以为荣的呢？这样的一个奴役性基地，同所谓“自由生活”根本是风马牛不相及，而今天美国的那些人却去庆祝它的建堡二百周年，岂不是对美国反抗英国而争取独立的历史一大讽刺？艾森豪威尔津津有味地把今天美国在海外的军事基地同二百年前的里戈尼尔堡相比，这倒是比对了，因为他恰恰是不打自招地承认了那些军事基地同里戈尼尔堡一样地是侵略者设在他国领土上的侵略据点。“保卫自由”的谎言，不击自破！
    美国的那些热中于把美国人民卷入冒险漩涡中的人，煞费苦心地想找一个象征“自由生活”和“保卫自由”的“历史古迹”，以便借题发挥祖传的“西部”冒险精神，诱骗美国人民支持艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的战争冒险政策，结果却找错了“古迹”，找了一个在美国人民看来只能是象征殖民奴役和侵略的里戈尼尔堡！战争冒险的鼓吹者想愚弄美国人民，却暴露了自己的无知和愚蠢！（附图片）
