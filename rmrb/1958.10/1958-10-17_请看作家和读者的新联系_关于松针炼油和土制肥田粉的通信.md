Please See the New Connection Between Writers and Readers—Correspondence Regarding Pine Needle Oil Extraction and Homemade Fertilizer

    Reader's Letter One: To the Editors:
    We were very excited to read the essay "Industrial Flowers Bloom All Over the Mountains" by writer Jin Jin published in the supplement of the People's Daily, which described a township in Zhejiang manufacturing turpentine and fertilizer. In the great leap forward of national production, who can remain calm? How much we hope to make the industrial flowers bloom in our hometown mountains as well!
    We hope you will forward our request to Comrade Jin Jin to introduce the specific methods of manufacturing turpentine and fertilizer so that we can learn from them. Would that be possible?
    Xiong Junchao, Fengming Township, Ya'an County, Sichuan

      Reader's Letter Two: To the Editors:
    I am an ordinary cadre working in the Jinggang Mountain area. Our mountains are full of forests, but due to inconvenient transportation, a large amount of useful timber is burned as firewood, especially pine trees. Even pine needles and branches are not qualified as fuel, and they are left to rot on the mountains. Since reading about the deputy secretary of the county party committee in "Industrial Flowers Bloom All Over the Mountains," who used only two large iron pots and a stove to extract turpentine from pine needles, we have been greatly inspired and encouraged: we also want to use the waste here—pine needles—to create material wealth for the country! Unfortunately, this article did not introduce the operating procedures for extracting turpentine from pine needles. Can you help us solve this problem?
      Ren Guoting, Jinggang Mountain Reclamation Farm, Jiangxi Province

      Writer's Reply:
    On June 7th of this year, the People's Daily supplement published a short article I wrote called "Industrial Flowers Bloom All Over the Mountains." Since then, I have successively received letters from readers forwarded by the newspaper, all asking about the manufacturing process of turpentine and homemade fertilizer. Now I will write down some of what I know below.
    Turpentine is manufactured from pine needles and young pine branches using steam distillation. 10% borneol acetate (ice chips) is also added as a fragrance. The specific gravity is 0.781 at 20 degrees Celsius, and the oil yield is 0.2%-0.25%, with the fresh leaves of the first quarter being the best for production.
    The equipment for extracting turpentine is very simple: build a tiger stove, install two or three pots and two or three wooden barrels on the stove, and insulate the outside of the barrels with brick walls, filled with water or wood chips inside. (as shown in the picture)
    When extracting pine oil, put the pine needles and ingredients into the wooden barrel, and add water to the pot to heat and boil. After the steam enters the barrel, the pine oil will gradually seep out. The burning time is about six to eight hours.
    When burning, pay attention to adding water to the pot at regular intervals to prevent it from drying out. At the same time, the fire should be strong, and always pay attention to the temperature in the condenser, which should be maintained at 50 to 70 degrees Celsius. The condensing tube in the condenser needs to be made of tin.
    Regarding the ingredients for homemade fertilizer:
    35 jin of human manure, 4 jin of salt, 4 jin of alum, 4 jin of saltpeter, 20 jin of gypsum, 25 jin of bone meal. Put it in a pot and fry until dry.
    Homemade chemical fertilizers have been tested in many rural areas of Zhejiang Province, and this is just one of them.
    I am very grateful to the comrades for their encouragement. Let us advance side by side on the labor front and send each other good news!
                      Jin Jin

      Editor's Note:
    Each time a relatively good literary work is published in the newspaper, many readers enthusiastically write letters, requesting to contact the author. Many of them become familiar with the author from then on, form good friends, and constantly encourage each other in their work.
    After reading the above three letters, dear readers, what do you think?
    This connection between writer Jin Jin and the readers, like many past connections between authors and readers, is somewhat different: the writer has become involved in the leap forward upsurge of socialist production. He not only uses literary pen to write about the new people and new things emerging on the labor front, inspiring readers to invigorate and move forward, but also helps readers understand the technical issues in the production process, acting as a pollinator for the flowers of socialist industry of the motherland! This shows that our writers have penetrated into the center of socialist construction and are no longer guests in factories and rural areas; this shows that writers and readers have established a new connection on the basis of labor production, and they have an additional layer of relationship of fighting side by side on the construction front. What a joyful and exciting new atmosphere! (with picture)

### 请看作家和读者的新联系——关于松针炼油和土制肥田粉的通信

    请看作家和读者的新联系
    ——关于松针炼油和土制肥田粉的通信
    读者来信一编辑同志：
    人民日报副刊发表作家金近同志写的散文“工业花朵满山开”里，描写了浙江一个乡制造松节油和肥田粉的事，我们看了非常兴奋。在全国生产大跃进的浪潮里，谁能平静呢？我们多么希望也使自己家乡的山区开出工业的花朵来啊！
    希望你们转请金近同志把制造松节油和肥田粉的具体作法介绍出来，以便我们学习。好不好？
    四川雅安县凤鸣乡　熊俊超
      读者来信二编辑同志：
    我是建设井冈山山区的一个普通干部。我们山上有的是森林，由于交通不便，大量有用的木材都当成柴烧掉了，尤其是松树。松针和树枝连作燃料的资格都没有，任它们在山上霉烂。自从看到“工业花朵满山开”中介绍的县委副书记，仅用两口大铁锅和一座炉灶，用松针炼出了松节油后，给了我们很大的启发和鼓舞：我们也要用这里的废物——松针来为国家创造物质财富！可惜这篇文章没有介绍用松针炼松节油的操作工序，不知你们能帮助我们解决这个问题吗？

                      任国庭
      作家的回信
    今年6月7日，人民日报副刊上发表了一篇我写的“工业花朵满山开”的短文，以后就陆续收到由报社转来的读者来信，都问起松节油和土制肥田粉的制造过程。现在把我所知道的一些情况写在下面。
    松节油是以松针和松树嫩枝用蒸馏法来制造的。还加上10％的醋酸龙脑（冰片）作香料。比重在摄氏20度时是0.781，出油率0.2％—0.25％，以第一季度的鲜叶做起来最好。
    提炼松节油的设备很简单：砌一个老虎灶，在灶上安两三口锅和二至三个木桶，桶外用砖墙保温，内灌水或木屑。（如图）
    提炼松油的时候，把松针和配料放入木桶内，锅内放上水加热烧开。水汽进入桶内后，松油就会逐渐渗出来。烧的时间约为六至八小时。
    烧的时候，要注意隔一定时间后就要往锅里加水，不使干涸。同时火力应烧得旺，并且随时注意冷凝器内的温度应保持在摄氏五十度至七十度。冷凝器内的冷凝管需用锡制造。
    关于土制肥田粉的配料：
    人粪三十五斤，盐四斤，白矾四斤，土硝四斤，石膏二十斤，骨粉二十五斤。放在锅里煎干为止。
    土制化学肥料经浙江省各地农村试验的，已有好多种，这不过是其中的一种。
    我很感谢同志们给我的鼓励。让我们在劳动战线上并肩前进，互传捷报吧！
                      金　近
      编者的话
    每次，当报纸上发表了一篇比较好的文艺作品后，总是有许多的读者热情地来信，要求同作者联系。他们之中的不少人，从此同作者熟识了，结成要好的朋友，在工作中不断地彼此鼓励。
    读了上面三封信以后，亲爱的读者们，你们怎样想呢？
    作家金近同志与读者们的这次联系，同过去许多次作者与读者的联系一样，可是却又有些不一般：作家卷入了社会主义生产的跃进高潮中，他不但以文艺的笔，写出了劳动战线上涌现出来的新人新事，使读者受到鼓舞而振奋前进，而且还帮助读者了解生产过程中的技术问题，作了祖国社会主义工业之花的授粉人！这说明了我们的作家们已经深入了社会主义建设的中心，而不再是到工厂农村作客了；这说明了作家同读者在劳动生产的基础上建立了新的联系，他们又多了一层在建设战线上并肩作战的关系。这是多么叫人喜悦、叫人兴奋的新气象！（附图片）
