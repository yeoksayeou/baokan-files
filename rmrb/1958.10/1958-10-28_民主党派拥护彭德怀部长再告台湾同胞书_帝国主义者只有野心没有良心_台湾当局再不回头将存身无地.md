Xinhua News Agency, 27th: A person in charge of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a written statement regarding the Ministry of National Defense's second letter to Taiwan compatriots. The text is as follows:

    It is a matter of course that Chinese affairs can only be resolved by us Chinese ourselves, and absolutely no American imperialists are allowed to interfere. Our Ministry of National Defense has repeatedly and earnestly advised Taiwan compatriots that they must understand this simple, clear, and extremely important principle. Now our country is developing rapidly, and all patriots have a way out. Don't be afraid of imperialism. We should prioritize patriotism and harmony, turning enemies into friends. Now is the time.

    We love our motherland. We will not allow imperialists to damage even a single blade of grass or tree in our motherland. We must issue serious warnings and protests when American imperialist planes and warships intrude into our territorial waters and airspace. When the Taiwan authorities introduce American military escorts in the Jinmen waters, our artillery will speak. This is a matter of anti-imperialist and patriotic stance, and we should do so. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. We are not afraid of American imperialists. In our eyes, American imperialists are nothing but paper tigers. Taiwan authorities, don't be afraid of American imperialism. The Ministry of National Defense's statement clearly states that we hope you strengthen unity and unite against foreign enemies. We hope you will not succumb to American pressure, blindly follow others, lose sovereignty, and ultimately have nowhere to exist and be thrown into the sea.

    All imperialists have only ambition and no conscience. The Chinese people have long seen through this. American imperialists are even more vicious. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to all. Now the American imperialists regard Taiwan as a "de facto political entity" that can be kicked away at any time. The Taiwan authorities must clearly recognize this dangerous situation. Relying on American imperialists is like placing your neck under their knife. You should think twice, not miss the opportunity, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible!

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Leading members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and cadres of the central organs held a forum on the 26th regarding the second letter to Taiwan compatriots issued by Minister Peng Dehuai of the Ministry of National Defense.

    Those who spoke at the meeting unanimously supported this statement, believing that every word and sentence of the statement was earnest and well-intentioned, fully expressing the deep concern of the people of the motherland for Taiwan compatriots, and demonstrating to the people of the world that the Chinese people are truly peace-loving.

    Those who spoke at the meeting also believed that the political broker Dulles sneaked to Taiwan this time, playing the trick of high-pressure fraud, and named Taiwan as a "small China," plotting to create two Chinas to isolate Taiwan and then put Taiwan under trusteeship. This is something we absolutely cannot allow, and Taiwan compatriots will not agree to it. The Taiwan issue is a matter for the Chinese people themselves. Chinese affairs can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves, and we will never allow American imperialists to interfere, and we will never allow Dulles's conspiracy to succeed.

    The meeting also unanimously pointed out that the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots are patriotic. Under the oppression and humiliation of the Americans, Taiwan public opinion is increasingly feeling disappointed and indignant, advocating to control their own destiny. This is understandable. In Taiwan, only a very small number insist on deviating from the motherland. All patriots have a way out and will be welcomed by the people of the motherland.

    Those who spoke at the meeting also emphasized that imperialism has no good intentions. This is a historical lesson. Zhang Zuolin's fate can serve as a warning. I hope the Taiwan authorities will be careful of the poisonous hands of American imperialists, accept our well-intentioned advice, resolutely abandon darkness and turn to the light, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible, uniting against foreign enemies. Now, what is beneficial and what is harmful, what to take and what to discard, is very obvious. The question is whether the Taiwan authorities have remorse and determination.

    民主党派拥护彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书
    帝国主义者只有野心没有良心  台湾当局再不回头将存身无地
    新华社27日讯　中国民主建国会负责人就我国防部再告台湾同胞书发表书面谈话，文如下：
    中国人的事只能由我们中国人自己解决，绝对不允许美帝国主义者插手。这是天经地义的道理。我国防部一而再，再而三，苦口婆心地忠告台湾同胞必须了解这个简单明白而又极为重要的道理。现在我们的国家正在一日千里的发展，一切爱国者都有出路，不要怕什么帝国主义，应当以爱国为重，以和为贵，化敌为友，此其时矣。
    我们爱祖国。我们祖国的一草一木都不允许帝国主义者损害。美帝国主义者的飞机和军舰侵入我国领海领空，我们必须提出严重警告和抗议；台湾当局在金门海域引进美军护航，我们的大炮就要说话。这是反帝爱国立场问题，我们应当这样做。中国人民不是好惹的，我们不怕美帝国主义者，美帝国主义者在我们的眼里不过是一只纸老虎。台湾当局们，不要怕美帝国主义。我国防部的文告中说得很清楚，我们希望你们加强团结，一致对外；希望你们不要屈服于美国人的压力，随人俯仰，丧失主权，最后存身无地，被人丢到大海里去。
    一切帝国主义者只有野心，没有良心，中国人民老早看穿了这一点。美帝国主义者更为凶恶，所谓司马昭之心，路人皆知。现在美帝国主义者把台湾当作一个“事实上存在的政治单位”，随时可以一脚踢开，台湾当局对这种危险境地一定要认识清楚。依靠美帝国主义者，就是把自己的颈子架在它的刀口上，你们应当三思，勿失良机，早日回到祖国的怀抱中来！
    新华社27日讯　中国农工民主党中央领导人员和中央机关的干部26日就我国防部彭德怀部长发布的再告台湾同胞书举行了座谈会。
    在会上发言的人一致拥护这个文告，认为这个文告的一字一句，都是语重心长，仁至义尽，充分表达了祖国人民对台湾同胞的深切关怀，在全世界人民面前表明了中国人民是真正热爱和平的。
    会上发言的人还认为，政治掮客杜勒斯这次灰溜溜地跑到台湾，玩弄了高压欺诈的手法，把台湾封为“小中国”，阴谋以制造两个中国来孤立台湾，进而托管台湾，这是我们绝对不能容许的，也是台湾同胞不会答应的。台湾问题，是中国人自己的事情，中国人的事只能由中国人自己解决，决不让美帝国主义者插手，决不让杜勒斯的阴谋诡计得逞。
    会议还一致指出，台湾同胞绝大多数都是爱国的，台湾舆论在美国人的欺压侮辱下越来越感到失望、愤懑，主张要自己掌握自己的命运，这是可以理解的，在台湾，坚持背离祖国的只是极少数，一切爱国者都有出路，都将受到祖国人民的欢迎。
    在会上发言的人还着重指出，帝国主义没有好心，这是历史教训，张作霖的下场，可为殷鉴。希望台湾当局当心美帝国主义者的毒手，接受我们好心的劝告，毅然弃暗投明，及早回到祖国的怀抱来，一致对外。现在孰利孰害，何取何舍，摆得非常明显，问题就看台湾当局的悔悟和决心了。
