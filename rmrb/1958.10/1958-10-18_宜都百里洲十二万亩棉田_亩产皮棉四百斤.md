Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Yidu County's Bailizhou in Hubei Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest on its 120,000 mu of cotton fields. It is estimated that the average yield per mu will be over 400 jin of ginned cotton, an increase of nearly seven times compared to last year.

Bailizhou is a sandbar island in the heart of the Yangtze River, with a total area of 190,000 mu, mainly planted with cotton. In the past, due to extensive cultivation and a lack of attention to technology, yields were very low. Before 1956, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu was only 30 to 50 jin, and last year it was only about 54 jin. This year, the farmers of Bailizhou have thoroughly changed the past situation of "weeds eating cotton, insects eating cotton," weeding and fertilizing, and exterminating insects four or five times in general. They have also conscientiously promoted new technologies, so this year's cotton plants are chest-high, with more than 3,400 plants per mu, each with 35 to 40 bolls, and some with as many as 60 or more. According to measurements, every four or five bolls contain about one tael of cotton.

The main experience of the Party organization here in leading production is: fully mobilizing the masses, constantly checking, constantly rectifying, and constantly carrying out mass-based comparisons and competitions. The contradiction of insufficient labor has also been better resolved.

    宜都百里洲十二万亩棉田
    亩产皮棉四百斤
    据新华社讯　湖北省宜都县百里洲十二万亩棉田空前大丰收。据估计，平均每亩可产皮棉四百斤以上，比去年增产近七倍。
    百里洲是长江江心的一块沙洲田，总面积十九万亩，主要种植棉花。过去由于耕作粗放，不讲究技术，产量很低，1956年以前平均亩产皮棉仅三十斤到五十斤，去年也只有五十四斤左右。今年，百里洲农民彻底改变了过去“草吃棉、虫吃棉”的状况，锄草追肥、灭虫一般的达四五次，并认真推广了新技术，所以今年的棉株高及胸，每亩三千四百多株，株株有三十五到四十个桃子，多的达六十多个，据测定，每四、五个桃子就有一两棉花。
    这里党组织领导生产的主要经验是：充分发动群众，不断检查，不断整风，不断开展群众性的评比竞赛。劳动力不足的矛盾也解决得较好。
