    Creating Miracles in Production Practice
    Li Zi
    The entire faculty and students of Hunan Agricultural College, numbering 1,014, created a miracle after working in the countryside and mountains for just six months. Even the young ladies and gentlemen nicknamed "Shanghai Miss" and "Sleeping Bugs" became fighters on the production front. Linking theory with practice and participating in productive labor is indeed a good remedy for transforming people. More importantly, people not only transform their thinking in production practice but also truly unleash the brilliance of human wisdom. In just six short months, these 1,014 people wrote more than 2,700 academic papers and investigation reports—a miracle that the "tidal wave observers" could never have dreamed of!
    At the on-site conference held by agricultural colleges and universities nationwide at Nanjing Agricultural College, it was decided that starting in the second half of this year, all faculty and students of existing higher agricultural colleges and universities would be sent to the countryside to participate in labor and training. This decision is extremely correct. Higher agricultural colleges and universities that are far removed from reality and far behind the peasants have had their "academy" signs smashed by agricultural production "satellites"! Teachers are ashamed to continue teaching, and students have no desire to continue listening. In fact, it's not that the teachers and students are bad, but that the bourgeois erroneous orientation of being divorced from reality and productive practice has poisoned them. You have to use the right medicine to cure the disease. If the disease is being divorced from reality and productive labor, then you have to use the medicine of linking theory with practice and participating in productive labor to cure it. Hunan Agricultural College was able to create miracles after only half a year of treatment with this medicine, which shows that this medicine is the best medicine, and it cures the disease quickly and effectively. Those "tidal wave observers," if they stubbornly refuse to accept new ideas and new things, will be left far behind by the times if they continue to "observe" the "tides" for another half a year!
    Sending faculty and students of higher agricultural schools to participate in labor implements the socialist educational policy of combining education with productive labor. Combining education with productive labor is the concrete embodiment of Chairman Mao's philosophical thought of practice in education. Chairman Mao told us long ago: Marxists consider human productive activity to be the most basic practical activity and the determinant of all other activities. Human understanding mainly depends on material productive activity to gradually understand natural phenomena, natural properties, natural laws, and the relationship between man and nature; and through productive activity, it also gradually understands the definite interrelationships between people to varying degrees. All this knowledge cannot be obtained without productive activity. Chairman Mao's words could not be clearer. It is inconceivable that faculty and students of higher agricultural colleges and universities, divorced from agricultural production activities, could truly understand natural phenomena, natural properties, and natural laws in agriculture, as well as the relationship between man and nature! The facts also fully prove that higher agricultural colleges and universities divorced from productive practice will have their reputations smashed by agricultural production "satellites," while higher agricultural colleges and universities that participate in productive practice will truly become "higher" institutions and play a promoting role on the agricultural front.
    The miracles that the entire faculty and students of Hunan Agricultural College have created in the past six months are only the initial achievements provided by higher agricultural colleges and universities under the guidance of the socialist educational policy. In the future, after all higher agricultural colleges and universities are sent down, and after higher agricultural colleges and universities find a complete set of methods for combining education and productive labor, the Chinese people will create more and greater miracles in agricultural education, agricultural production, and agricultural science, so that our country's agricultural science will far surpass the world's current level in all aspects!

    在生产实践中创造奇迹
    李梓
    湖南农学院全体师生一千零十四人下乡上山劳动了仅仅半年，就出现了奇迹。绰号“上海小姐”、“睡眠虫”的小姐少爷也竟成了生产上的战士。联系实际，参加生产劳动的确是改造人的一副良药。更重要的是，人们在生产实践中不只改造了思想，还能使人类智慧真正放出光彩。他们一千零十四人在短短的半年中，竟然写出了二千七百多篇学术论文和调查报告，这是观潮派作梦也想不到的奇迹！
    全国农业院校在南京农学院举行的现场会议上决定今年下半年起，现有高等农业院校的全体师生一律下放农村劳动锻炼。这个决定极为正确。远远脱离实际，远远落后于农民的高等农业院校，那“学府”的牌子，实际上已经给农业生产上的“卫星”砸碎了！教师已经无颜教下去，学生也已经无心听下去。其实，并不是教师、学生不好，而是资产阶级的脱离实际，脱离生产实践的错误方向毒害了教师、学生。得什么病，就要用什么药医。害的是脱离实际，脱离生产劳动的病，就要用联系实际，参加生产劳动的药来医。湖南农学院用这副药仅仅医治了半年就能出现奇迹，这就说明，这副药是最好的药，并且药到病除，见效得很。那些观潮派，如果他死不接受新思想新事物，他再“观”上半年“潮”就将被时代抛在很远的后面！
    高等农业学校师生下放劳动，贯彻了教育结合生产劳动的社会主义教育方针。教育结合生产劳动，是毛主席实践论的哲学思想在教育工作中的具体体现。毛主席早就告诉我们说：马克思主义者认为人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他一切活动的东西。人的认识，主要地依赖于物质的生产活动，逐渐地了解自然的现象、自然的性质、自然的规律性、人和自然的关系；而且经过生产活动，也在各种不同程度上逐渐地认识了人和人的一定的相互关系。一切这些知识，离开生产活动是不能得到的。毛主席这一段话说得再清楚没有了。不能设想，高等农业院校的师生脱离了农业生产活动竟能真正懂得农业方面的自然现象、自然性质、自然规律、以及人和自然的关系！事实也完全证明脱离生产实践的高等农业院校就要被农业生产的“卫星”砸了招牌，而参加了生产实践的高等农业院校就名副其实的成为“高等”的院校，在农业战线上起促进作用。
    湖南农学院全体师生下放半年所出现的奇迹，还仅是高等农业院校在社会主义教育方针指导下，提供的初步成就。今后，在高等农业院校全体下放之后，在高等农业院校找到完整的一套教育与生产劳动相结合的方法之后，中国人民在农业教育、农业生产、农业科学上，将创造出更多更大的奇迹，从而使我国农业科学在各个方面都远远超过世界现有水平！
