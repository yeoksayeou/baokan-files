According to Wen Hui Bao, Shanghai: The Shanghai Hypertension Research Institute was officially established on the 5th. Under the unified planning of the institute and the large-scale collaboration of Chinese and Western medicine practitioners in the city, hypertension research will develop more rapidly in the future. This is a powerful guarantee for basically controlling hypertension in the city within three years.

Since the Shanghai medical community proposed the bold initiative to basically control hypertension within three years, it has done a lot of work under the unified leadership of the Party and with the strong collaboration of relevant parties. Shanghai Second Medical College alone, in the past two months, has completed a general survey of hypertension in 110,000 people in seventeen different occupations, and has conducted preliminary statistics, analysis, and research. The average incidence of hypertension is 7.59%, with farmers having the lowest incidence at only 1.77%. They have initially identified the relationship between patients and their occupations. In terms of clinical treatment, Renji Hospital, affiliated with the Second Medical College, has adopted comprehensive frozen therapy to treat patients with cerebral hemorrhage, increasing the survival rate of cerebral hemorrhage patients from the original 12.9% to 54.8%.

The task of the research institute is to mobilize all positive factors in the city that are conducive to hypertension research, regardless of Chinese, Western, local, or foreign methods, whether acupuncture, qigong, drugs, or medical sports, and to seek cooperation and contact with other parts of the country to jointly study the pathogenesis and treatment of hypertension. At present, medical colleges, pharmaceutical research institutes, pharmaceutical factories, and pharmaceutical companies have jointly established factories and medicinal herb gardens, preparing to obtain effective drugs from experimental research for mass production and supply. In terms of investigation and research, they will continue to analyze the causes of the disease in depth and propose comprehensive preventive measures. In clinical practice, they plan to establish joint Chinese and Western medicine wards to create conditions for the integration of Chinese and Western medicine.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: Shanghai's medical community has found more than twenty kinds of plant-based medicines in traditional Chinese medicine that can be used to lower blood pressure. Among them, Erxian Decoction (compound), Stinking Glorybower, Moutan Bark, Glehnia Root, and Qingmuxiang have been used clinically with significant effects. Erxian Decoction, which mainly treats hypertension in elderly women, has an effective rate of 74.59% in the treatment of 366 cases (including 45.9% mildly effective). Stinking Glorybower has an effective rate of 72.56% in the treatment of 430 patients with essential hypertension (including 46.64% mildly effective), which is 27% to 29% higher than the effect of treatment with reserpine preparations, which are world-renowned (of which the mild effect is 24% higher).

    三年内控制高血压病的有力保证
    上海高血压病研究所成立
    已找到了二十多种中药可治高血压病
    据上海文汇报消息　上海市高血压病研究所，于5日正式成立。在研究所的统一计划和全市中西医的大协作下，高血压的研究工作，今后将得到更快的发展。这对全市三年内基本控制高血压病，是一个有力的保证。
    上海市医学界自从提出三年内基本控制高血压病的大胆倡议以后，在党的统一领导和有关方面的大力协作下，已经作了不少工作。仅上海第二医学院，在最近二个月内，已经在十七种不同职业的十一万人口中，完成了高血压病的普查工作，并作了初步的统计、分析与研究。高血压病的平均发病率是7.59％，其中农民的发病率最低，仅1.77％。他们初步摸出了患者和职业的关系。在临床治疗方面，第二医学院附属仁济医院采用综合冰冻疗法治疗脑溢血病人，使脑溢血病人的生存率由原来的12.9％提高到54.8％。
    研究所的任务是，把全市所有对高血压病研究有利的积极因素，不论中、西、土、洋，不论针灸、气功、药物、医疗体育都调动起来，并且要与全国各地取得协作和联系，共同研究高血压病的发病机制与治疗。目前医学院、药物所、药厂、药材公司等单位已合作办工厂、药圃，准备从实验研究方面得出有效的药物，以便大量生产与供应。在调查研究方面，将继续深入分析病因，提出综合性预防措施。在临床方面，准备设立中西医联合病房，为中西医合流创造条件。
    据新华社上海6日电　上海医药界已在中药中找到了二十多种可供降低高血压的植物药物。其中二仙汤（复方）、臭梧桐、牡丹皮、藓沙参、青木香等已在临床使用，效果显著。主治老年妇女高血压的二仙汤，治疗三百六十六例的有效率为74.59％（包括轻度有效45.9％），臭梧桐治疗原发性高血压病人四百三十例，有效率为72.56％（包括轻度有效46.64％）。比以世界著称的蛇草根制剂对照治疗的效果要高27％到29％（其中轻度效果高24％）。
