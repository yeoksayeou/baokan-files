    Singing the Praises of Xie Demei
    ·Li Duansheng·
    Molten iron flows, the land is red,
    In this leaping-forward year, heroes are bred,
    Today I sing of no other,
    But of a worker from the Meitanba coal mine,
    This man is named Xie Demei,
    A vigorous dragon and lively tiger in his prime.
    Only three days on the job as a senior worker,
    He actively toils and achieves miraculous feats.
    One day he digs sixteen tons of coal,
    Exceeding the seventh-grade worker by more than double.
    Everyone says his efficiency is high,
    His name is on the honor roll.
    How does he dig coal?
    He digs coal like a chicken pecking rice,
    Never relaxing for a second,
    Every swing of the hoe is full of energy,
    Using his strength evenly throughout his body,
    Digging the surrounding area of the coal face well,
    Without delaying the timbering work at all,
    Using his eyes, brain, hands, and feet together,
    Completing two days' worth of tasks in one day,
    Production rising sharply in three days.
    This is truly: the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves,
    "Zhao Zilong" surpasses the old "Huang Zhong."

    歌唱谢德枚
    ·李端生·
    铁水奔流遍地红，
    跃进年头出英雄，
    我今不唱别一个，
    单唱煤炭坝一工人，
    这人名叫谢德枚，
    生龙活虎正年轻。
    当上大工才三天，
    积极苦干立奇功。
    一天挖煤十六吨，
    超过七级工一倍零。
    个个说他效率高，
    光荣榜上他有名。
    他是怎样挖煤的呢？
    挖煤就像鸡啄米，
    分秒时间不放松，
    一锄一锄都带劲，
    全身力气用得匀，
    壋头四边挖得好，
    架棚没误一点工，
    眼脑手脚齐用上，
    两天任务一天完成，
    三天产量猛上升。
    这正是：长江后浪推前浪，
    “子龙”盖过老“黄忠”。
