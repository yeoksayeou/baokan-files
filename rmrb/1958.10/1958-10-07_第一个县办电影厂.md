Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, October 5th: Changling County, Jilin Province, has established a news film studio. The first newsreel, "Celebrating the Realization of People's Communes Throughout the County," was officially screened in September.

    The person who created this film studio was Fang Jingsheng, a staff member of the Changling County Broadcasting Station. His spirit of daring to think and act was encouraged and supported by the Changling County Party Committee. The County Party Committee encouraged him to experiment boldly and actively contacted the Changchun Film Studio to send him to study there. After a few days of study, he mastered the basic techniques of filmmaking. After returning, he spent more than 400 yuan to buy two old cameras and a small projector. He also converted the projector into a printer. When developing the film, there was no developing room, so he borrowed the office of the county newspaper, using the cloth curtain of the county cinema to block the light; without a drying room, it was taken outside to dry. In this way, in thirteen days, using five hundred yuan, the film studio was built, and the first film was shot.

    Changling County is a sandy county on the western grassland of Jilin Province. This area is remote and the transportation is inconvenient. The general public has never seen a movie. When they saw their own films, the scenes of their hometown life appeared on the screen, everyone was overjoyed.

    第一个县办电影厂
    新华社长春5日电吉林省长岭县建立起一座新闻电影制片厂。第一部“庆祝全县实现人民公社化”的新闻纪录影片已在9月间正式放映。
    创建这个制片厂的是长岭县广播站工作人员方景生，他这种敢想敢作的精神得到了中共长岭县委的鼓励和支持。县委一面鼓励他大胆试验，一面积极与长春电影制片厂联系，派他到长春电影制片厂去学习。他经过短短几天的学习，掌握了拍制电影的基本技术，回来后花了四百多元购买两台旧摄影机和一台小型放映机。他又将放映机改成了印片机。洗片时没有洗印室，就借用县报社的办公室，用县电影院的布帘遮光；没有烘干室，就拿到外面晾晒。就这样，前后十三天时间，用了五百元钱，将电影制片厂建成了，并拍摄出第一部影片。
    长岭县是吉林省西部草原上的一个沙岭县。这里地势偏僻，交通不便，一般群众历来没看过电影，当他们看到了自己拍制的影片，自己家乡的生活情景在银幕上出现的时候，个个都兴高采烈。
