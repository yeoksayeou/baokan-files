Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 21st: Sarit Thanarat, Supreme Commander of the Thai Armed Forces, launched a coup d'état on the evening of the 20th and took over the Thai government.

Sarit announced on the evening of the 20th the dissolution of the parliament, the suspension of the constitution, and the implementation of martial law throughout the country from 9 p.m. on the 20th. Before Sarit took over the government, Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn and the entire cabinet announced their resignation.

In his broadcast statement last night, Sarit called this action a "revolution" and said that it was carried out "when necessary in view of the serious and dangerous domestic and international situation." He said that the purpose of taking over the government was to "deal with the serious communist threat at home and abroad and to safeguard the constitutional monarchy."

Troops carrying automatic weapons and bayonets have entered strongholds near the government and the army headquarters. Sarit instructed the troops not to accept orders from anyone other than himself.

According to Western news agencies, Sarit had just returned to Bangkok from Britain before launching the coup. He stayed in Britain for three months and was originally scheduled to return home at the end of the year to recuperate after undergoing surgery in the United States in the first half of this year. While in the United States, he met with U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. In the past two weeks, he met with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd.

    乃沙立在昨晚的这项广播声明中把这个行动称为“革命”，并且说这个行动是“鉴于严重和危险的国内外局势而在必要的时候进行的”。他说，接管政府的目的是为了“对付国内外严重的共产党威胁和维护君主立宪政体”。
