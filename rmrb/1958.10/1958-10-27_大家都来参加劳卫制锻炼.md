Editorial: Everyone Should Participate in Labor-Defense System Exercises

    Currently, the nation's construction endeavors are advancing at an astonishing pace. However, American imperialism continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and is conducting war threats against our country in the Taiwan Strait region. On the one hand, we must vigorously promote production and construction to guarantee a complete victory on the production front. On the other hand, we must vigorously consolidate national defense, preparing to crush imperialist incursions. In order to undertake these dual tasks well, every Chinese person, especially the youth and adults, must not only politically raise their communist consciousness, but also have a steel-like strong physique. Just imagine, how can a person who gets dizzy after staying in front of a steelmaking furnace for three or five hours complete their production tasks? How can a person who cannot withstand the wind and rain and cannot lift a gun shoulder the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland? The situation is compelling. To enhance physical fitness, actively participate in physical exercise, especially participating in the labor-defense sports system exercises closely integrated with production and national defense. At present, this is of particularly important significance.

    With the rising enthusiasm of the people for labor and national defense, the implementation of the Labor-Defense System has gradually spread across the country, and more and more people are participating in Labor-Defense System exercises. Many schools, factories, mines, institutions, troops, and rural areas across the country have launched a high tide of Labor-Defense System exercises. Units that pass all levels of Labor-Defense System standards by 100% are constantly emerging.

    By September of this year, more than 6.77 million people have passed the Labor-Defense System standards at various levels after training. However, this number is far from meeting the needs of our country's production and national defense. We demand that one hundred million, two hundred million, or even more people can pass the Labor-Defense System, so that every young and middle-aged person in the country can truly become a model of labor production, a hero of defending the motherland, and a strong athlete on the sports field. To this end, we need to make more effort in promoting the Labor-Defense System. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission recently announced the revised Labor-Defense Sports System Regulations and Project Standards. Localities should promote them more widely based on the new regulations and project standards, and launch a higher mass labor-defense sports exercise upsurge.

    Perhaps some people will ask: What are the benefits of us engaging in the Labor-Defense System on such a large scale? The facts of the past few years have proved that the Labor-Defense System has many benefits. The Labor-Defense System is the basic requirement put forward by the state in sports exercise based on the needs of socialist construction. It can comprehensively develop a person's body and effectively enhance physical fitness. To facilitate implementation, uniform regulations have been made for this system to form a complete sports system. Its exercise goal is labor and national defense, which is very clear. Its projects include running, jumping, shooting, swimming, etc., which are suitable for people with various sports interests to participate in. Therefore, the Labor-Defense System is a basic system for promoting the development of mass sports activities. Among the projects of the Labor-Defense System, there are both general sports projects and national defense sports projects. With comprehensive physical development, great energy, and good endurance, one can better serve production. For example, after young workers in the Beipiao Mining Area participated in Labor-Defense System exercises, their production efficiency greatly improved. They compiled a jingle to illustrate the difference before and after participating in the exercises: "Labor-Defense System, passed the test, work becomes lively, body lively, push more carts, two people used to push one, now one person pushes one." Learning national defense knowledge can better serve national defense. Like many college students at Hefei Mining Institute, while passing the Labor-Defense System by 100%, they also achieved the standard of ordinary sharpshooters by 100%. In addition, the projects of the Labor-Defense System are relatively comprehensive. Regular participation in exercise can comprehensively develop sports skills and play a great role in improving sports level. Because the Labor-Defense System has many benefits, it is loved by the broad masses. Farmers in Beipiao County, Liaoning Province, wrote such a fast-clapper poem praising the Labor-Defense System: "Labor-Defense System, clear and bright, every project has indicators, running, jumping, throwing, climbing have everything, reaching the standard is called good, badge hanging on the chest, certificate in the waist, train the body to have great energy, build the motherland and make contributions."

    In order to enable the Labor-Defense System to be promoted more quickly and universally, and to be easily accepted by the masses, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission promulgated the new Labor-Defense Sports System Regulations and Exercise Project Standards on October 25, which were approved by the State Council. This regulation is simpler and clearer than the previous one, and the exercise project standards have also been simplified and adjusted. The new regulations stipulate that the Labor-Defense System Level 1 and Level 2 each have six projects, which is three less than in the past. This makes it easier for grass-roots units to master in the implementation, and both units with good and poor conditions can implement it. In order to take care of the different conditions in various places, the new regulations also stipulate that the sixth project standard of Labor-Defense System Level 1 and Level 2 shall be determined by the sports commissions of each province, autonomous region, and municipality according to the specific conditions of the local area. This flexible regulation allows localities to determine the sixth project standard for implementation in their own regions according to local conditions, which can make the Labor-Defense System more smoothly promoted, and can also give play to local enthusiasm. Therefore, it can be said that the revised Labor-Defense System Regulations and Project Standards are more complete and easier to implement than before.

    The new Labor-Defense System Regulations and Project Standards have been announced. In order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production and national defense construction, all localities should, on the existing basis, give the Labor-Defense System a Great Leap Forward, and strive for more people to participate in Labor-Defense System exercises and more people to pass the Labor-Defense System standards at all levels. The new Labor-Defense System project standards can be passed by people with a little sports foundation after only two or three months of exercise. In addition, after the masses liberate their minds and break superstitions, they are full of energy, and it is entirely possible for the Labor-Defense System to have a Great Leap Forward. Chairman Mao said: The militia division is not only a military organization, but also a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization. In the future, the promotion of the Labor-Defense System must be closely combined with militia training. Militia training is to make everyone strong and healthy, and everyone can master preliminary national defense knowledge and military skills. Many of the Labor-Defense System exercise projects are similar or the same as the content of militia training. Therefore, the Labor-Defense System can be completely combined with militia training. At present, all localities are busy with production and have very little free time. If the Labor-Defense System exercises are combined with militia training, it can be accomplished in one battle. Recently, Shanxi and other places have decided to promote the Labor-Defense System in the militia division. At the same time, the promotion of the Labor-Defense System should also be closely combined with labor production. Exercise where production is, and carry out physical exercise to meet the needs of labor production. In addition, the promotion of the Labor-Defense System must follow the mass line. In the past, the Labor-Defense System was talked about as profound and difficult to understand, making people daunted and affecting universal promotion. This is because the mass line was not followed well. In the nine months of this year, millions of people have passed the Labor-Defense System standards at all levels, greatly exceeding the achievements of the past four years. The key to being able to leap forward many times lies in truly following the mass line. Promoting the Labor-Defense System is the same as doing other work, relying on the masses, and the work can be done well.

    The promotion of the Labor-Defense System is related to the health of the entire people and to the entire socialist construction. All localities should closely combine the Labor-Defense System with production and national training, and implement the Labor-Defense System in a planned and earnest manner.

    大家都来参加劳卫制锻炼
    目前，祖国的各项建设事业都在以惊人的速度向前跃进，而美帝国主义却继续强占我国领土台湾，并在台湾海峡地区对我国进行战争威胁。我们一方面要大搞生产建设，保证生产战线上的全面胜利，另一方面还要大力巩固国防，准备粉碎帝国主义的进犯。为了把这双重任务很好地担当起来，每一个中国人，特别是青年和壮年，除了要在政治上提高共产主义觉悟以外，还要有钢铁般的强壮体格。试想，一个在炼钢炉前呆上三、五个钟头就头晕眼花的人，怎能完成生产任务；一个经不住风吹雨打，拿不动枪杆的人，怎能负起保卫祖国的神圣职责。形势逼人。为了增强体质，积极参加体育锻炼，特别是参加同生产和国防紧密结合的劳动卫国体育制度的锻炼，在目前是更具有特别重要意义的。
    随着人们劳动卫国的热情的高涨，劳卫制的推行已逐渐遍及各地，参加劳卫制锻炼的人愈来愈多。全国很多学校、厂矿、机关、部队以及农村都掀起了劳卫制锻炼的高潮。百分之百地通过劳卫制各级标准的单位不断涌现。
    到今年9月止，经过锻炼，通过劳卫制各级标准的已达到六百七十七万多人。但是，这个数字还远不能适应我国生产和国防的需要。我们要求一亿、二亿以至更多的人能通过劳卫制，使全国每一个青壮年真正成为劳动生产的模范、保卫祖国的英雄、运动场上的健将。为此，在劳卫制的推行上，需要再努一把力。前日，国家体育运动委员会公布了经过修改的劳动卫国体育制度条例和项目标准，各地应该根据新的条例和项目标准，更广泛地推行，掀起一个更高的群众性劳动卫国体育锻炼高潮。
    或许有人问：我们这样大搞劳卫制，究竟有些什么好处？几年来的事实证明，劳卫制的好处很多。劳卫制是国家根据社会主义建设事业的需要，在体育锻炼上提出的基本要求。它可以全面地发展人的身体，有效地增强体质。为了便于推行，把这一制度作出统一规定，使它形成一个完整的体育制度。它的锻炼目标是劳动卫国，非常明确。它的项目有跑、跳、射击、游泳等，适合各种体育爱好的人参加。因此，劳卫制是推动群众性体育运动开展的基本制度。劳卫制的项目中，既有一般体育项目，又有国防体育项目。身体有了全面发展，劲头大，耐力好，就能更好地为生产服务。例如北票矿区青年工人参加劳卫制锻炼后，生产效率大大提高。他们编了一首顺口溜来说明参加锻炼前后的不同：“劳卫制，合了格，干起活来身子活，身子活，多推车，过去两人推一辆，现在一人推一车。”学到了国防知识就能更好地为国防服务。像合肥矿业学院等很多高等学校学生在百分之百地通过劳卫制的同时，也百分之百地达到了普通射手标准。另外，劳卫制的项目比较全面，经常参加锻炼，运动技术可以得到全面发展，对提高运动水平起很大的作用。因为劳卫制的好处多，所以为广大群众所喜爱。辽宁省北票县的农民写出这样一首赞扬劳卫制的快板诗：“劳卫制，好明了，个个项目有指标，跑跳投爬样样有，达到标准就叫好，证章胸前挂，证书装在腰，炼好身体劲头大，建设祖国立功劳。”
    为了使劳卫制能更迅速普遍地推行，并易为群众所接受，国家体育运动委员会10月25日颁布了经国务院批准的新的劳动卫国体育制度条例和锻炼项目标准。这个条例比较以前的简单明了，在锻炼项目标准上也加以简化和调整。新的条例规定劳卫制一、二级各有六个项目，比过去减少了三个。这样基层单位在推行中就便于掌握，条件好的和差的单位，都可以推行。为了照顾各地条件不同，新的条例还规定劳卫制一、二级的第六个项目标准，由各省、自治区、市体委根据当地具体条件自行规定。这样灵活规定，各地就能因地制宜地确定本地区推行的第六个项目标准，可以使劳卫制更顺利地推行，同时也可以发挥地方的积极性。因此，可以说修改后的劳卫制条例和项目标准，较前更完善，更利于推行。
    新的劳卫制条例和项目标准公布了。为了适应生产大跃进和国防建设的需要，各地应该在现有的基础上，让劳卫制来个大跃进，并争取更多的人参加劳卫制锻炼，更多的人通过劳卫制各级标准。新的劳卫制项目标准，稍有运动基础的人只要经过两三个月的锻炼就可以通过，再加上群众思想解放、破除迷信后，干劲十足，劳卫制来个大跃进是完全可能的。毛主席说：民兵师又是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。今后劳卫制的推行一定要密切结合民兵训练。民兵训练，就是要使人人身强力壮，人人能掌握初步的国防知识和军事技术，劳卫制的锻炼项目同民兵训练内容很多是相近的或相同的。因此，劳卫制同民兵训练完全可以结合为一。目前，各地都在忙生产，空闲很少，如果把劳卫制锻炼同民兵训练结合在一起，就可以毕其功于一役。最近山西等地已经决定在民兵师中推行劳卫制。同时，推行劳卫制也应该紧密结合劳动生产进行。那里生产，那里锻炼。为适应劳动生产的需要进行身体锻炼。另外，推行劳卫制一定要走群众路线。过去把劳卫制讲得高深难懂，使人望而生畏，影响普遍推行，这就是没走好群众路线。今年九个月的时间就有几百万人通过劳卫制各级标准，大大超过过去将近四年的成绩。所以能成番地跃进，关键就在于真正走了群众路线。推行劳卫制同做其他工作一样，依靠群众，工作就能做好。
    劳卫制的推行关系到全民的健康，关系到整个的社会主义建设，各地应该把劳卫制同生产和全民训练紧密结合，有计划地认真地把劳卫制推行起来。
