This newspaper reports from Changsha on October 5th. Reporter Hu Jian reports: The Party's socialist education policy is shining brightly at Hunan Agricultural College. This college was among the first higher education institutions in the country to move to the countryside. Currently, all 1,014 faculty and students have labored in the countryside for half a year, achieving tremendous success. By the end of August, the entire college's faculty and students had earned over 500,000 work points, averaging nearly 500 work points per person. They are students and also peasants. This is unprecedented in history, both ancient and modern, at home and abroad, and is a victory of a massive revolution in human education.

The many practical problems encountered by the faculty and students in productive labor in the countryside have compelled them to study and investigate, resulting in many scientifically valuable papers and investigation reports. By the end of August, they had written more than 2,740 articles, an average of eighteen articles per day. However, in the past seven years, the entire college's faculty and students had written no more than 300 articles. The "lookers-on" clamoring that "university students going to the countryside is a waste," "nothing can be learned in the countryside," and "going to the countryside will affect scientific research work" have been completely bankrupt in the face of ironclad facts.

The combination of education and productive labor has first and foremost promoted a great ideological revolution among the faculty and students. Jin Huizhu, a Communist Youth League member and Russian assistant teacher whom the students used to call "Shanghai Miss," labored for a full half-year in the mountainous areas of Huitong. She had never seen such high mountains. When she first started climbing, her hands and feet were weak, and she had to crawl on the ground. The first time she went barefoot, she worried that her feet would become thick, making it difficult to wear high heels in the future, and she secretly cried. The first time she saw a yellow cow, she surprisingly called it a "horned horse." The first time she went to the fields to hoe corn, she stood in the cornfield and asked where the corn was, making the peasants burst into laughter. She was very distressed and wanted to sneak back to school several times. But when she saw Wei Xiuying, a sixteen-year-old poor peasant girl who lived with her, going to work early and late every day, and when she thought of the glorious title of Communist Youth League member, she gained strength and persevered. At first, she only earned two or three work points per day, but now she can earn seven points per day. Everyone says: Who would have thought that the "Shanghai Miss" who used to wear high heels and apply lipstick every day would change in labor? She herself also tells everyone she meets: "This trip to the countryside has opened my eyes and is better than reading books for twenty years."

There are many people like Jin Huizhu among the faculty and students sent down. Liu Shaoji, a student who labored in the Huai Shuxia Agricultural Cooperative in Chen County, used to be spoiled at home, having his face-washing water brought to his bedside, and was a "young master" who lazily got out of bed late. At school, his nickname was "Sleeping Bug." But now, he goes to work with the peasants early and late, has earned more than 700 work points, and has twice been rated as a labor model by the cooperative. It is now understood that about 80% of the faculty and students have been praised by the county, township, or cooperative, or have been rated as labor models.

Hunan is a well-known rice-producing area in the country, but in the past, the school taught more about planting wheat and less about rice. This time, after the faculty and students were sent down, this phenomenon of teaching being divorced from reality was fundamentally reversed, and a relatively systematic investigation and research was conducted on rice cultivation techniques. In the most recent period alone, the school newspaper published 168 articles on aspects such as deep plowing, close planting, direct seeding, and preventing lodging of rice, all of which have great scientific value and practical significance. This fully demonstrates the enormous power that the Party's socialist education policy has generated in practice.

When scientific research work is combined with mass production labor, it quickly opens the door to scientific mysteries and sets off a mass upsurge of scientific research, and many "authoritative conclusions" have been overturned. Xie Yinqiu, a lecturer in soil science, and Zhang Juncai, a young assistant teacher, who worked in the Genglou Agricultural Cooperative in Hengyang County, summarized the local peasants' afforestation experience on the bare and barren Guangshan Mountains of purple shale, breaking the traditional view of the scientific community that purple shale cannot be afforested. Yan Changjing, a young assistant teacher and Communist Party member, summarized the peasants' experience in increasing rice production through deep plowing and direct seeding in Yizhang County, overturning the established conclusion of the scientific community that "direct seeding cannot increase production." In Bailu Township, Changsha County, there is a pest called the "Mangzhong Worm" that seriously harms sweet potatoes around the Mangzhong solar term. When planting sweet potatoes this year, the peasants asked the university professors to help them control the "Mangzhong Worm." However, among the fifty or so faculty and students there at the time, many had studied entomology, but none had heard of this worm. The peasants caught the worms and showed them to them, but no one recognized them. The entomology teachers returned to school and searched through Chinese and foreign books, but could not find its scientific name. Later, the faculty and students went down to interview old farmers, and within two months, they basically mastered the life cycle of the Mangzhong Worm and found methods for its prevention and control. This pest has now been found in more than a dozen counties across the province, and this research will have a significant impact on ensuring increased sweet potato production in the future.

The sent-down faculty and students are both students of the peasants and teachers of the peasants. More than 80% of the sent-down faculty and students served as teachers in civil schools, technical night schools, and agricultural universities, actively participating in the literacy campaign. According to incomplete statistics as of the end of August, under the specific leadership of the local Party committees, they assisted relevant departments in establishing three agricultural universities, sixty-six technical night schools, and more than one hundred civil schools. Illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been basically eliminated in the townships and cooperatives where they are located. At present, more than 5,000 peasant technicians have been trained through technical night schools. They have scattered the seeds of science and culture everywhere in the countryside.

    劳动改造思想　劳动增长学问
    湖南农学院下放到农村办学取得巨大成就
    本报长沙5日电　记者胡坚报道：党的社会主义教育方针，已经在湖南农学院放出异彩。这所学院是全国高等学校中最早下农村的。现在，全院一千零一十四名师生，已经在农村劳动了半年，取得了巨大成就。到8月底止，全院师生共做了五十多万个劳动工分，平均每人将近五百个工分。他们是学生，又是农民。这是古今中外闻所未闻的事，是人类教育史上一次巨大革命的胜利。
    师生们下放到农村后，在生产劳动中碰到的许多实际问题，迫使他们去钻研、调查，写出了很多有科学价值的论文和调查报告。到8月底止，共写了二千七百四十多篇，平均每天有十八篇。可是，在过去七年多的时间内，全院师生写的论文不超过三百篇。观潮派嚷着：“大学生下乡是浪费”，“到农村学不到什么东西”，“下农村会影响科学研究工作”等论调，在铁的事实面前，完全破产了。
    教育和生产劳动相结合，首先促进了师生们的思想大革命。过去被同学们称为“上海小姐”的共青团员、俄文助教金慧珠，在高山峻岭的会同林区整整劳动了半年。她从没有见过这么高的山。开始上山时手脚都软了，只好在地上爬。第一次打赤脚时，她担心脚长粗了，将来不好穿高跟鞋，就暗地哭脸。她第一次看到黄牛，惊奇地叫它为“长角的马”。第一次下地锄包谷，她站在包谷地里，还问包谷在哪里，弄得农民捧腹大笑。她很苦恼，几次想偷偷地回校。但是当她看到和她住在一起的十六岁的贫农女孩子魏秀英，每天起早摸黑地出工时，当她想起共青团员这个光荣称号时，她有了力量，坚持了下来。开始她每天只评两、三分工，现在，每天能评到七分。人人都说：想不到过去穿高跟鞋、天天搽口红的“上海小姐”，在劳动中也变了样。她自己也逢人就说：“这次下乡开了眼界，胜读二十年书。”
    像金慧珠这样的人，在下放师生中很多。在郴县槐树下农业社劳动的学生刘绍箕，过去在家里娇生惯养，洗脸水叫人送到床边，是一位日上三竿懒起床的“少爷”，在学校的绰号叫“睡眠虫”。可是，现在他和农民起早睡晚地出工，已作了七百多个劳动工分，两次被社里评为劳动模范。据现在了解，全院师生约有80％受到县、乡、社的表扬，或被评为劳动模范。
    湖南是全国有名的水稻产区，可是过去学校里却讲种麦子多，讲水稻少。这次师生下放后，才根本上扭转了这种教学脱离实际的现象，对水稻栽培技术作了比较系统的调查研究。单是最近一个时期，校刊上就发表了一百六十八篇有关水稻深耕、密植、直播和防止倒伏等方面的论文，而且都有着很大的科学价值和现实意义。这充分证明党的社会主义教育方针在实践中产生了何等巨大的力量。
    科学研究工作与群众生产劳动结合起来，就很快打开了科学神秘的大门，掀起了群众性的科学研究高潮，许多“权威结论”被推翻了。在衡阳县更楼农业社劳动的土壤学讲师谢吟秋和青年助教张俊才等，总结了当地农民在紫色页岩的光山秃岭上的造林经验，打破了过去科学界认为紫色页岩不能造林的传统说法。青年助教、共产党员颜昌敬，在宜章县总结了农民水稻深耕、直播增产的经验，推翻了过去科学界认为“直播不能增产”的定论。长沙县白禄乡有一种在芒种节前后严重地危害红薯的害虫，农民叫“芒种虫”。在今年栽红薯时，农民要求大学教授们帮助他们制服“芒种虫”。可是当时在那里的五十多名师生，有不少是学了昆虫学的，没有一个听说过这种虫。农民把虫子捉给他们看，谁也不认得。昆虫学老师们，回校翻遍了中外书籍，也找不到它的学名。后来，师生们下去访问老农，不到两个月就基本上掌握了芒种虫的生活规律，并找到了防治方法。现在全省十多县都发现有这种害虫，这种研究工作，对保证今后红薯增产，将有着很大作用。
    下放师生们做农民的学生，又当农民的先生。下放师生有80％以上担任了民校、技术夜校和农业大学的教员，积极参加了扫盲工作。据8月底不完全统计，他们在当地党委的具体领导下，协助有关部门办起三所农业大学、六十六所技术夜校、一百多所民校。他们所在的乡、社都基本上扫除了青壮年文盲。目前，通过技术夜校培养的农民技术员有五千多人。他们在农村到处撒下了科学文化的种子。
