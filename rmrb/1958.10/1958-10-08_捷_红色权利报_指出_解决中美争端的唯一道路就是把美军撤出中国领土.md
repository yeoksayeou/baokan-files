Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th. The "Red Rights Newspaper" pointed out in a commentary today that the letter to Taiwan compatriots issued by Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, is new evidence demonstrating the strength of the People's China. The publication of this message shows that the Chinese government is opening up a path to peacefully resolve China's internal problems.

The commentary, written by the newspaper's Beijing correspondent, pointed out that China's civil war issue cannot become the target of international negotiations. The temporary cessation of shelling of Chinese coastal islands is a step that only involves the two sides of the Chinese civil war and has nothing to do with the US's "ceasefire" demands.

The commentary said that there is only one way to resolve the dispute between the United States and China, and that is to withdraw the US armed forces from Chinese territory.

    捷“红色权利报”指出
    解决中美争端的唯一道路就是把美军撤出中国领土
    新华社布拉格7日电　“红色权利报”今天在一篇评论中指出，中华人民共和国国防部长彭德怀发表的告台湾同胞书，是一个表明人民中国的力量的新证据。这个文告的发表说明，中国政府正在开辟和平解决中国内部问题的道路。
    这家报纸驻北京记者写的评论指出，中国的内战问题不能成为国际谈判的目标。在中国沿海岛屿暂时停止炮击，这是一个只涉及中国内战双方的步骤，而同美国的“停火”要求无关。
    评论说，解决美国和中国两国之间的争端只有一条道路，这就是把美国武装部队撤出中国领土。
