    No U.S. Threat to Peace in the Indian Ocean
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    According to U.S. press reports, the U.S. Naval Command is stepping up preparations to establish a "Fifth Fleet" in the Indian Ocean. U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy visited the region for five weeks at the end of September this year, conducting investigations for the implementation of this plan. It is said that this will be a fleet with one or two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and six to ten destroyers, and it is also planned to equip it with strategic nuclear weapons.
    The United States has long coveted the Indian Ocean region. Since the end of World War II, the United States has not relaxed its plans for aggression and expansion in the Indian Ocean region. In 1946, the United States established a special naval command in the Middle East to oversee the fleet stationed in the Persian Gulf and the Western Indian Ocean. Relying on the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and bilateral agreements signed with some countries, the United States has seized many military bases in the Indian Ocean region. It obtained the right to use the coast of the Persian Gulf from Iran. The United States forced Qatar to agree to sign an agreement to build the Al-Shabban naval base for a period of ninety-nine years. The United States has obtained the right to station warships in the port of Massawa in Ethiopia. With U.S. participation, Pakistan is rebuilding the Karachi naval base and building the Chittagong base. With the continuous expansion of U.S. military bases in the Indian Ocean region, the Pentagon has long planned to establish an Indian Ocean Fleet to accelerate the implementation of military expansion activities. Before and after the U.S. military landed in Singapore in August, U.S. Navy officials announced that the U.S. Navy had been "stepping up efforts" months before this landing to set up "fuel and other supply stations" in the "strategic" ports along the Indian Ocean coast, in preparation for the permanent presence of the U.S. Navy in the Indian Ocean.
    The United States is so eager to station a large naval force permanently in the Indian Ocean for its ulterior motives. Many newly independent countries in the Eastern Indian Ocean, under the influence of the "Bandung Spirit," insist on pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality and are striving to make the Indian Ocean region a peaceful region. In the Western Indian Ocean, British East African colonies such as Kenya, British territories in the Persian Gulf, and countries in the Arabian Peninsula such as Yemen, Aden, and Oman are waging heroic struggles to break free from colonial shackles and oppose colonial aggression. Today, the entire Indian Ocean region, from east to west, is ablaze with the flames of the anti-colonialist struggle. The old colonialist Britain, which once rampaged in the Indian Ocean, has had to retreat step by step from east to west. In this situation, the neo-colonialist United States is eager to fill the so-called "power vacuum" and re-impose U.S.-made colonial shackles on the millions of people in the Indian Ocean region who have gained independence and freedom. Therefore, the U.S. plan to establish an Indian Ocean Fleet is primarily aimed at the surging national independence movement in the Indian Ocean and the people of this region.
    The U.S. plan to establish an Indian Ocean Fleet will pose a serious threat to the peace and security of the entire Indian Ocean region. Once the U.S. aggressors gain a foothold in this region, they will create tensions and carry out military threats, just as they have done in the Middle East and the Far East, placing the independence and sovereignty of various countries under their gun muzzles. Such activities by the United States are bound to be strongly opposed by the people of all countries. Not long ago, when the U.S. military landed in Singapore, the people of Southeast Asian countries condemned it in unison, believing it to be a threat to the Southeast Asian region. Recently, the news of the United States establishing an Indian Ocean Fleet has aroused even more indignation among the public and public opinion in various countries.
    The Indian Ocean is the Indian Ocean of the Indian Ocean people. It is completely unreasonable for the United States, separated by a vast ocean, to run to the Indian Ocean to establish a so-called "Fifth Fleet." The United States is neither close to the Indian Ocean, nor does the Indian Ocean region have an inch of U.S. territory. On what basis does the United States put warships in the Indian Ocean? The "gunboat policy" is long outdated. The U.S. Sixth Fleet and Seventh Fleet have not intimidated the people of the Middle East and the Far East. On the contrary, they have only aroused a more resolute struggle among the people of various countries against U.S. aggression. The United States wants to establish a "Fifth Fleet," which is simply putting another new noose around its own neck.

    不许美国威胁印度洋和平
    本报评论员
    据美国报刊透露，美国海军司令部正加紧准备在印度洋建立一个“第五舰队”。美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊于今年9月末到这个地区作了五周的访问，为执行这项计划从事考察活动。据说，这是一支拥有一艘或两艘航空母舰、两艘巡洋舰和六至十艘驱逐舰的舰队，而且还准备配备战略性的核武器。
    美国对于印度洋地区垂涎已久。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国一直没有放松在印度洋地区实行侵略扩张的计划。1946年美国在中东建立了一个专门的海军司令部管辖驻在波斯湾和西印度洋的舰队。美国依靠巴格达条约集团、东南亚条约组织以及同一些国家签定的双边协定，在印度洋地区又攫取了许多军事基地。它从伊朗取得了利用波斯湾沿岸的权利。美国迫使卡塔尔同意以九十九年为期签订一项修建阿尔沙班海军基地的协定。美国在埃塞俄比亚取得了在马沙乌亚港停驻军舰的权利。在美国参与下，巴基斯坦正在改建卡拉奇海军基地和修建齐塔根基地。随着美国在印度洋地区的军事基地不断扩展，五角大楼早就打算建立一个印度洋舰队，来加速推行军事扩张活动。今年8月美军在新加坡登陆前后，美国海军部的官员就宣布过，美国海军在距这次登陆的几个月以前一直就在“加紧努力”，要在印度洋沿岸的“战略要冲”港口设立“燃料和其他物资的供应站”，为美国海军常驻印度洋进行准备。
    美国如此急不及待地要把一支庞大的海军力量常驻在印度洋上，是有其不可告人的目的的。东印度洋的许多已获得独立的国家在“万隆精神”的影响下，坚持实行和平中立政策，为使印度洋地区成为和平地区而进行努力。在西印度洋上，怯尼亚等英属东非殖民地、英国在波斯湾的属地以及阿拉伯半岛的也门、亚丁、阿曼等国家，正在为挣脱殖民枷锁，为反对殖民侵略而进行英勇的斗争。今天，整个印度洋地区，从东到西燃遍了反殖民主义斗争的烈火。在印度洋上横行一时的老牌殖民主义者英国，已经不得不从东到西步步退却。在这种情况下，新殖民主义者的美国便急于要填补所谓“实力真空”，把美制的殖民枷锁重新套在印度洋地区已经取得独立自由的千百万人民的身上。因此，美国建立印度洋舰队的计划，其矛头首先是指向印度洋上风起云涌的民族独立运动，指向这个地区的人民。
    美国计划建立的印度洋舰队，对于整个印度洋地区的和平和安全将构成严重的威胁。美国侵略者一旦立足于这个地区，它将像在中东和远东一样制造紧张局势，进行军事威胁，把各国人民的独立主权置于它的炮口之下。美国的这种活动，必然要遭到各国人民的强烈反对。不久以前美军在新加坡登陆时，东南亚各国人民就同声加以谴责，认为是对东南亚地区的威胁。最近美国建立印度洋舰队的消息传来后，更加引起各国公众和舆论的愤慨。
    印度洋是印度洋人的印度洋。隔了一个大洋的美国硬要跑到印度洋来建立什么“第五舰队”，这是根本没有道理的事情。美国既靠不着印度洋的边，印度洋地区又没有美国的一寸土地，美国凭什么要把兵舰摆在印度洋上？“炮舰政策”早就过时了。美国第六舰队和第七舰队并没有吓倒中东和远东人民，相反，它只是激起了各国人民反对美国侵略的更坚决的斗争。美国想建立什么“第五舰队”，无非是又给它自己套上一条新的绞索罢了。
