    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 21st: Of the 114 counties and cities in Shandong Province, 113 have basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. According to preliminary statistics, the number of non-illiterate young and middle-aged people in the province's 18.03 million has risen from 20% before liberation to 86.4%. In nine counties and cities, including Xin County, Laiyang, Zouping, Pingdu, and Weihai, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people has been completely eliminated. The province has established a network of worker-peasant education, and a complete system of worker-peasant education from primary school to university has been formed.
    The rapid progress of this year's literacy campaign is primarily due to the Party's strengthened leadership. Party secretaries at all levels personally took charge, leading literacy work in the same way they led mass movements. Secondly, focusing on production, the literacy work was properly arranged, enabling both to be integrated and promote each other. Busy with production all year round, studying culture all year round, the learning content and learning forms adapted to the requirements of production. In the process of "everyone teaching everyone learning," all localities constantly "broke old methods and established new methods," carried out teaching innovations, broke the old view of "teaching one lesson in three days, eliminating illiteracy in two years," and developed and applied phonetic character rapid literacy teaching method, rapid reading teaching method, and rapid writing method, greatly accelerating the progress of literacy.
    After completing literacy courses, the province immediately launched a consolidation and improvement movement of "reading a hundred books and writing ten thousand characters," and the "original soldiers, original generals, original organization" all advanced to spare-time primary schools.

    一年四季忙生产　一年四季学文化
    山东省基本扫除文盲
    新华社济南21日电　山东省全省一百一十四个县市中，已有一百一十三个县市基本完成扫除青壮年文盲的任务。据初步统计，全省一千八百零三万青壮年中的非文盲人数，已由解放前的20％上升到86.4％。莘县、莱阳、邹平、平度和威海市等九个县市，青壮年中的文盲已全部扫除。全省已建立起一个工农教育网，从小学到大学的工农教育事业已形成完整的体系。
    今年的扫盲运动所以进展得快，首先是党加强了领导，各级党委书记都亲自挂帅，以领导群众运动的方法来领导扫盲工作。其次，以生产为中心，妥善安排扫盲工作，使两者相互结合，相互推动，一年四季忙生产，一年四季学文化，学习内容和学习形式适应生产的要求。各地在全民教全民学中，不断地“破旧法，立新法”，开展教学革新，打破“三天教一课，两年扫一盲”的陈旧观点，发展和运用了同音字速成教学法、速成阅读教学法、速成写字法等，大大加快了扫盲进度。
    在扫盲结业之后，全省立即展开了“读百本书，写万个字”的巩固提高运动，“原兵、原将、原组织”全部升入业余小学。
