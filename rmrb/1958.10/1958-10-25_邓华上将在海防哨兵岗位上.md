General Deng Hua on a Coastal Defense Sentry Post
    Chen Ye
    One day in early October, the sun was already far to the west. The soldiers of the coastal defense outpost company were about to gather for dinner when they heard that cadres had come down to serve as soldiers. They ran quickly down the hillside to greet them. Seventh Squad Leader Yu Dehua ran the fastest. He saw a private, nearly fifty years old, walking towards him with a small backpack. He rushed to carry it for him. The old private affectionately held his hand and said, "I can carry it, it's not tiring." But the seventh squad leader insisted on taking the backpack. He asked, "Old comrade, what's your name?" "Me? Call me Li Jian!"
    After the new privates reported, they were immediately assigned to squads. When the company instructor called out the name Li Jian, this new private responded with a "Here!" like an ordinary soldier and stood in the ranks of the seventh squad of the third platoon.
    On his first night as a soldier, Li Jian requested guard duty or patrol duty from the third platoon leader: "We are here to train, we need to learn from you. If we don't participate in concrete work, we won't learn anything."
    The coastal patrol in this area requires climbing mountains and ridges, and passing through narrow paths on cliffs. Even comrades familiar with the terrain and roads must be careful when patrolling at night, or they will stumble and fall, or even fall off the cliff. On the second night of Li Jian's arrival at the company, the platoon saw that he was so old and had already stood guard during the day, so they didn't want him to patrol in the dark. But he picked up his gun, put on his ammunition belt, and rushed out the door. The platoon leader and squad leader couldn't dissuade him or pull him back, only hearing him say repeatedly, "I'm not tired, I'm in good health." So he went on patrol with the young soldiers.
    In less than two or three days, the soldiers were moved by the old comrade's drive. Comrade Guan Dehua wrote a quick-clapper verse: "He's old, but his enthusiasm soars to the sky. He works hard all day, and at night he asks to stand guard."
    When doing the first exercises on the horizontal and parallel bars, Li Jian practiced with the young men. The platoon leader was afraid he would have an accident because of his age, so he stood under the horizontal bar to "insure" him, but he didn't want him to, saying, "No need, I can do it!" Saying that, he grabbed the bar with both hands, inverted his upper body, and stretched his legs upwards. He didn't stretch up the first time. He said, "Let's do it a second time!" He finally stretched his feet over the horizontal bar on the third try. After the exercise, it was free activity, and the soldiers were all doing high jumps. Li Jian also ran over excitedly. At this time, it was jumping to 1.15 meters, and he didn't jump over it three times. The soldiers advised him, "Old comrade, don't jump, it's not a joke if you fall!" Li Jian said, "Don't think I'm old, I will definitely jump over." He took a sharp step with his right leg and jumped over. As soon as he jumped over, a young man who couldn't jump over originally also jumped over after him.
    Every day after getting up, Li Jian rushed to tidy up his bedding and sweep the yard. He was even more unwilling to show weakness in labor. One day, he was collecting pig feed—cutting sweet potato vines. In the field, he took off his hat, took off his coat, and gripped the sickle tightly, cutting with a swish, swish sound, while explaining his method of cutting the vines, sweating profusely.
    No one in the company knew what this old comrade did. They only felt that he was very approachable. Every night, they gathered around him and listened to him tell stories of the Red Army's arduous struggle and heroic battles during the Long March. Li Jian was very concerned about the soldiers' lives, often asking if the clothes, shoes, and socks they received each year were enough to wear, and if there was enough grain to eat? He encouraged the soldiers to engage in more agricultural and sideline production. Seeing a small open space in front of the barracks, he suggested reclaiming wasteland to grow sweet potatoes. He also asked about the soldiers' family lives, told the soldiers about the benefits of the people's communes, and the happy prospects.
    After a few days together, the soldiers felt that Li Jian was like their father and elder brother. Whenever they rested, they surrounded him and said playfully, "Old comrade! Tell another story!" So, they were quickly immersed in the heroic combat life of the 25,000-li Long March. Especially Li Xiaoyou, while listening quietly, carefully looked at every deep wrinkle on Li Jian's face, and was even more moved. He thought: This respectable new comrade, when I was not yet born, he had already tasted how many hardships for the people's good life? How much effort did he put in!
    Li Jian also loved this group of young, enthusiastic, and pure lads more and more. They guarded the coastal defense day and night, and knew every stone on the beach as well as their own fingers; whenever they mentioned the people's commune, they shouted with joy; whenever they had free time, laughter and songs that would never end would pour out of their mouths. What made him especially happy was that they were united and friendly, and had very close relations with the residents. The squad and platoon leaders could always take the lead in doing things. The old traditions of the Red Army shone brightly on the younger generation of soldiers! One day, at a military conference of the entire company, the division leader announced that Comrade Li Jian was General Deng Hua, the commander of the troops. The conference hall was silent for a few seconds, and then everyone stood up spontaneously and burst into long and enthusiastic applause. Li Jian walked out of the ranks and saluted everyone, and the applause slowly stopped. Li Jian said: "Comrades, I am very happy to guard the coastal defense and the gate of the motherland together with you! Comrades, you have given me a lot of help in the past few days. I hope you will continue to help me more and give me more advice in the future!" At this time, warm applause rang out again. The third platoon leader and the seventh squad leader, while applauding, stared at the old general who was serving as a soldier in their squad. The more they looked at him, the more they felt that he was not only their respected commander, but also their closest and best comrade-in-arms. Tears rolled from the corners of Li Xiaoyou's eyes. He remembered the bad idea he used to have of going home after his term of service expired, and he felt terribly sad! He thought of what the commander had just said! The two words 'motherland' were so kind and so warm! He thought of the small observation post standing on the coast, and thought of this old commander, holding his gun and standing there faithfully on duty, and thought of that dark night, when the commander rushed to patrol, and thought of the commander counting the steps that morning to understand how many roads they had to walk in a day, he couldn't wait to run out and stand in front of the commander and say: "I will never leave you, I will always guard the gate of the motherland with you!"

    邓华上将在海防哨兵岗位上
    陈叶
    10月初旬的一天，太阳已经大偏西了，海防前哨连的士兵们，正待集合吃晚饭，一听下连当兵的干部来了，就飞快地跑下山坡去迎接。七班长余德华跑得最快，他看见一位近五十岁的列兵正背着一个小小的背包迎面走来，就马上去抢着背。老列兵亲切地拉着他的手说：“我能背，不累。”可是七班长硬是把背包抢了过来，他问：“老同志，你叫什么名字？”“我吗？叫李坚！”
    新来的列兵们报到以后，马上编到班里。在连指导员点到李坚的名字的时候，这个新列兵像一个普通的战士一样答应了一声“到”，站进三排七班的队列里。
    当兵的第一天夜里，李坚就向三排长请求分配站岗或巡逻的任务：“我们是下连来锻炼的，要向你们学习，不参加具体工作，学不到什么。”
    这一带的海岸巡逻，要爬山越岭，要通过悬崖峭壁上的羊肠小路，即使熟悉地形、道路的同志们在黑夜里巡逻也得时刻小心，稍不留神就会跌跤子，甚至有掉到悬崖下面的危险。李坚到连队的第二天夜里，排里看他年纪这么大，白天已经站了岗，不让他在黑夜去巡逻，可是他拿起枪，背上子弹带就抢出门。排长、班长劝也劝不住，拉也拉不回，只听他连声说：“我不累，身体挺好。”就这样和青年战士们一起巡逻去了。
    不到两三天，战士们就被这位老同志的干劲感动。战士关德华同志写了个快板：“他人老年纪大，可干劲冲天啦，他白天干了一天活，夜晚又要求去站岗。”
    做单、双杠第一练习的时候，李坚和小伙子们一起在练，排长怕他年老有闪失，就站在单杠底下给他“保险”，可是他不要，说：“不用，我能上！”说着，两手一攀，上身倒悬，两脚向上伸去。第一次没伸上，他说：“再来第二次！”练到了第三次，终于把双脚伸上了单杠。练完以后是自由活动，战士们都在跳高，李坚也兴冲冲地跑去了。这时正跳到一米一五，他跳了三次都没跳过。战士们就劝他：“老同志，别跳了，跌一跤可不是玩的！”李坚说：“你们不要看我老，我一定跳得过去。”他右腿猛一跨，果真跳过去了。他一跳过，有个本来跳不过的小伙子，也猛的一下跟着跳过去了。
    每天起床后，李坚就抢着整理内务，打扫院子。在劳动中，他更不示弱。一天收集猪饲料——割地瓜秧，在田地里摘下帽子，脱掉上衣，紧握镰刀嗖嗖地割起来，边干还边介绍他的割秧方法，累得满头大汗。
    连队里都不知道这位老同志是做什么工作的，只觉得他很好亲近，每天晚上围拢着他，听他讲红军长征中的艰苦奋斗和英勇作战的故事。李坚非常关心战士们的生活，常常打听战士们每年发的衣服鞋袜够不够穿，粮食够不够吃？鼓励战士们多搞农副业生产。看到营房前边一片小平地，他建议开荒种地瓜；还问到战士们的家庭生活情况，给战士们讲人民公社的好处和幸福的前景。
    几天的相处，战士们觉得李坚像自己的父兄一样。每逢休息的时候，他们就围着他，顽皮地说：“老同志！再来一段吧！”于是，他们很快就沉浸在豪迈的两万五千里长征的战斗生活里。特别是李小有，他一面静静地听着，一面仔细地瞅着李坚脸上的每一条深深的皱纹，更是感动。他想：这位可敬的新战友，当我还没有生下来的时候，他已经为人民的美好生活尝过了多少艰难困苦？费过了多少心血啊！
    李坚，也越来越爱这批年青、热情、纯洁的小伙子了，他们日夜辛勤地守卫着海防，熟悉海滩上每一块石头就像自己的手指一样；一提到人民公社，他们就高兴得大声叫嚷起来；只要一有空，他们的嘴里就会涌出永远不会完的笑声和歌声。特别使他高兴的是，他们团结友爱，和居民的关系很亲密，班排长处处都能带着头干，红军的老传统，在年青一代的士兵身上闪耀着光辉！一天，在全连军人大会上，师首长宣布李坚同志就是部队司令员邓华上将。会场刹时静肃了几秒钟，接着，全体都不约而同的站起来，爆发出久久的热烈的掌声。李坚走出队列，向大家敬着礼，掌声才慢慢停息下来。李坚说：“同志们，我和你们一起，守卫着祖国的海防，祖国的大门，真有说不出的高兴！同志们，这几天，你们给了我不少帮助，希望你们今后继续不断地多帮助我，多指教我！”这时，热烈的掌声又响起来了，三排长和七班长一面鼓着掌，一面一眼不眨地瞧着这位在自己班里当兵的年老的将军，他们越看越觉得他不仅是他们敬爱的司令员，也是他们最亲切最好的战友。李小有的眼角上滚动着泪珠，他想起自己过去老是想着服役期满回家的坏念头，心里难过得要命！他想着司令员刚才说的话！祖国这两个字，多么亲切，多么温暖！他就想起那矗立在海岸上的小小的观察哨，想起这位年老的司令员，端着枪站在那里忠心耿耿的值勤，想起那天漆黑的晚上，司令员抢着去巡逻，想起司令员在那天早晨数着步子了解他们一天要走多少路，他恨不得跑出去，站在司令员的面前说：“我永远不离开你，我永远和你一起守卫着祖国的大门！”
