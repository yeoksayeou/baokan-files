Respected Vice-Chairman Comrade, dear comrades and friends:

I am very honored to be able to speak at this friendly gathering today on behalf of our government, the people of the German Democratic Republic, and all peace-loving Germans. For this, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you.

On our agenda today, there is only one thing: friendship, the friendship between our countries, the friendship between our peoples. This is a special kind of friendship, a socialist friendship, an alliance of internationalists, a manifestation of socialist internationalism. The countries represented by today's participants are all strong components of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Common worldviews, common paths, and common goals link these countries together; common social and economic structures and the class essence of the regimes link us together.

After the historic meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held in Moscow, the main center of the socialist camp, our peoples are united more closely; the great achievements of the socialist camp and socialist countries have been expanded; and the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism has been strengthened.

Comrade First Secretary Ulbricht, in his report on the work of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the Fifth Party Congress, put forward the following as the duty of all party members and the educational goal for the working people of the whole country:

"You should always defend the international solidarity of the working class and all working people, as well as the unbreakable and close ties of socialist countries."

Today will play an important role in consolidating the relations between China and Germany, as well as among all socialist countries.

The establishment of friendship associations initiated by Chinese people's organizations on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the National Day is a gift to the people of this country, and it is also a gift to all of us. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic.

At the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Comrade Dong Biwu, the Chinese representative, said:

"Socialist China and the socialist German Democratic Republic are fraternal countries born in the same year and the same month. The friendly relations and cooperation between our two countries in all aspects have developed satisfactorily."

The establishment of various friendship associations, as well as the Sino-German Friendship Association, will further strengthen the friendly relations between our two peoples, deepen and promote mutual understanding, and consolidate our fighting alliance day by day.

This is of particular significance at a time when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are carrying out a great leap forward in socialist construction. The great leap forward in socialist construction provides us with rich practical and theoretical experience.

For us—the western outpost of the socialist camp—it is of great help that the People's Republic of China has supported us, both in the past and at present, in the struggle against the West German monopoly capitalist groups and militarist forces in the German Democratic Republic, in the cause of unifying Germany on the basis of peace and democracy, and in the cause of defending peace in Europe and the world.

This firm support for our struggle and the vigorous development achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, especially during the period of last year and this year, have greatly enhanced the prestige of the People's Republic of China and increased the respect and friendship of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the people of West Germany towards China. This friendship was particularly evident during the days when the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, were carrying out heinous provocations and when peace was threatened. The government of the German Democratic Republic strongly condemned the U.S.'s policy of hostility towards peace, demanded that the U.S. immediately cease its provocative actions, and withdraw all U.S. troops from Chinese territory. This is not only the voice of our government, but also the voice of our working class and working people. In the face of this serious and dangerous situation, they stood firmly on the side of their Chinese brothers.

We thank the People's Republic of China for the help and support it has given to the German Democratic Republic and all peace-loving German people in the past. We are honored that, due to the German Democratic Republic's unswerving policy of peace and the achievements of the working people in their work, we have also been able to give support to the Chinese people, especially in the construction of enterprises such as the Zhengzhou Grinding Wheel Factory and the Beijing Radio Equipment Factory. We are convinced that the establishment of the Sino-German Friendship Association will further greatly consolidate the relations between us. Therefore, I once again congratulate the establishment of the Friendship Association. May our great cause of friendship achieve even greater success.

Long live Sino-German friendship!

Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live socialist internationalism!

### 我们永远联系在一起  德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔的讲话

    我们永远联系在一起
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔的讲话敬爱的副主席同志，亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我很荣幸，今天能够代表我们的政府，代表德意志民主共和国的人民以及全体爱好和平的德国人在这个友好的大会上讲话。为此，我谨向你们表示衷心的谢意。
    在我们今天的日程上只有一件事，就是友谊，我们国家之间的友谊，我们人民之间的友谊。这是一种特殊的友谊，是社会主义的友谊，它是国际主义者的同盟，社会主义国际主义的表现。今天与会者所代表的各国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚强的组成部分。共同的世界观、共同的道路和共同的目标把这些国家联系在一起；共同的社会、经济结构和政权的阶级实质把我们这些国家联系在一起。
    在社会主义阵营的主要中心——莫斯科召开的具有历史意义的社会主义国家共产党和工人党会议之后，我们各国人民团结得更加紧密了；扩大了社会主义阵营和各社会主义国家的伟大成就；加强了对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。
    第一书记乌布利希同志在第五次党代表大会上所作的统一德国社会党中央委员会工作报告中作为全体党员的义务和对全国劳动人民的教育目标提出：
    “你应当永远捍卫工人阶级和全体劳动人民的国际团结以及社会主义国家的牢不可破的紧密的联系。”
    今天这个日子将对巩固中德两国以及社会主义各国之间的关系起到重要的作用。
    中国各人民团体在国庆九周年前夕发起成立的友好协会是献给本国人民的礼物，这也是给我们大家的礼物。我愿意代表德意志民主共和国政府和人民对此表示感谢。
    在德国统一社会党第五次代表大会上中国代表董必武同志说：
    “社会主义的中国和社会主义的德意志民主共和国是同年同月诞生的兄弟国家。我们两国各方面的友好关系和合作有了令人满意的发展。”
    各友好协会的成立以及中德友好协会的成立将使我们两国人民之间的友好关系更加密切，加深和促进相互了解，使我们的战斗同盟日益巩固。
    当中国人民在中国共产党领导下进行社会主义建设大跃进的时期，这有着特殊的意义。社会主义建设大跃进为我们在实践上和理论上提供了丰富的经验。
    对于我们——社会主义阵营西方前哨来说，在德意志民主共和国反对西德垄断资本主义集团和军国主义势力的斗争中，在和平民主的基础上统一德国的事业中，在保卫欧洲及世界和平的事业中，在过去和现在都首先得到了中华人民共和国的支持，这是对我们很大的帮助。
    对于我们斗争的这种坚决支持和中国共产党领导下的中国人民特别在去年和今年这一时期内所获得的蓬勃发展，大大提高了中华人民共和国的威望，增进了德意志民主共和国人民以及西德人民对于中国的尊敬和友情。这种友情在美帝国主义者和他的走狗蒋介石集团进行罪恶的挑衅行为的日子里，在和平受到威胁的时候，表现得非常明显。德意志民主共和国政府严厉地谴责了美国敌视和平的政策，要求美国立即停止挑衅行动，并把全部美国军队撤出中国领土。这不仅是我国政府的呼声，也是我国工人阶级和劳动人民的呼声。在这种严重的危险的局势面前，他们坚定不移地站在自己的中国弟兄这一边。
    我们感谢中华人民共和国过去给予德意志民主共和国以及全体爱好和平的德国人民的帮助和支持。我们感到荣幸的是，由于德意志民主共和国坚持不渝的和平政策和劳动人民在工作中的成就，也能够给予中国人民以支持，特别是在郑州沙轮厂、北京无线电器材厂等企业的建设中。我们深信，中德友好协会的成立将进一步大大巩固我们之间的关系。因此，我再一次祝贺友好协会的成立。愿我们伟大的友好事业获得更大的成就。
    中德友好万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    社会主义国际主义万岁！
