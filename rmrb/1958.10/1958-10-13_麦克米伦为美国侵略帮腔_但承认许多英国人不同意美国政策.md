Xinhua News Agency, Blackpool, 12th: British Prime Minister Macmillan, speaking at a public rally convened by the Conservative Party here on the 11th, went to great lengths to exonerate the United States from its aggressive crimes in the Far East. He not only failed to condemn the United States for dispatching a large number of warships and aircraft to the Taiwan Strait, thousands of miles away from the United States, to carry out military provocations against the Chinese people, but also falsely accused the Chinese people, who are fighting to defend their territorial sovereignty, of "creating disputes in the Far East."

However, Macmillan had to admit in his speech that many people in Britain disagreed with US policy. But he said, "There are many Britons who want to quarrel with the United States," saying that this is an attempt to "divide the Western countries." He tried his best to ingratiate himself with the United States, saying that the "freedom" of the Western imperialist bloc "largely depends on the strength of the United States and its continued concern for the world." He believes that even if there are disagreements with US policy, they should only be raised "in private consultations" with "sincere advice" and should not be subject to "public accusations." Therefore, Macmillan revealed in his speech, in a way that he did not want to offend the United States, that Britain dared not completely follow the United States in its aggressive acts of military provocation and war threats in the Taiwan region. He said: "In the days when the initial disputes centered on Quemoy re-emerged in the Far East, I made clear the attitude of the British government and people in this spirit."

In his speech, Macmillan bluntly stated that Britain's foreign policy is based on the already bankrupt "strength" policy. He advocated that the "power" of aggressive blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty should be "maintained." He also advocated continuing the nuclear arms race, insisting that giving up such a race "would ruin" Britain's life. In addition, he defended the US-British interventionist troops' aggression against Lebanon and Jordan, as well as Britain's colonial rule in Cyprus.

Macmillan said in his speech that he still had not given up hope of holding a summit meeting and was prepared to attend a summit meeting "within or outside the United Nations."

Speaking of domestic issues, Macmillan admitted that unemployment in Britain is currently very serious. He believes that this is due to the adverse impact of the US economic crisis on British industrial production. But on the other hand, he pretended to be optimistic and boasted about the "satisfactory" results achieved by some of the financial measures recently taken by the Conservative government, in an attempt to quell the people's dissatisfaction with the Conservative Party's rule and achieve the goal of defrauding votes in next year's election.

    麦克米伦为美国侵略帮腔
    但承认许多英国人不同意美国政策
    新华社12日讯　布莱克浦消息：英国首相麦克米伦11日在保守党在此间召集的一次公众集会上发表演讲时，极力替美国在远东的侵略罪行开脱。他不但不谴责美国调遣大批军舰、飞机到远离美国万里之外的台湾海峡来对中国人民进行军事挑衅的行为，反而颠倒黑白地诬蔑为保卫领土主权完整而斗争的中国人民“在远东制造纠纷”。
    但是麦克米伦在演讲中不得不承认，在英国有许多人不同意美国的政策。但他说，“有许多英国人想同美国吵架”。说这是想要“分裂西方国家”。他极力讨好美国说，西方帝国主义集团的“自由在很大程度上要取决于美国的力量和它对全世界的不断关心”。他认为，即使对美国的政策有不同意见也只宜“用私下协商的方式”提出“真诚的劝告”，而不宜“进行公开指责”。因此，麦克米伦在演说中也就用不愿得罪美国的方式透露，在美国在台湾地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的侵略行径中，英国不敢完全跟着美国走。他说道：“在远东重新发生以金门为中心的最初的纠纷的日子里，我就本着这种精神表明了英国政府和人民的态度。”
    麦克米伦在演讲中直言不讳地说英国的对外政策是以早已破了产的“实力”政策作为依据的。他鼓吹应该“维持”北大西洋公约、东南亚条约和巴格达条约等侵略性集团的“威力”。他还主张继续进行核军备竞赛，硬说放弃这种竞赛“会断送”英国的生命。另外，他替美英干涉军对黎巴嫩和约旦的侵略行为以及英国在塞浦路斯实行的殖民主义统治进行了狡辩。
    麦克米伦在演讲中表示，他仍然没有放弃举行最高级会议的希望，并且准备参加“在联合国之内或在联合国之外”举行的最高级会议。
    在谈到国内问题时，麦克米伦承认英国目前的失业现象十分严重。他认为，这是由于美国经济危机对英国工业生产的恶劣影响所引起的。但是另一方面，他却又故作乐观地大肆吹嘘保守党政府最近采取的某些财政措施所取得的“满意”成果，企图平息人民对保守党统治的不满而达到在明年大选中骗取选票的目的。
