Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 24th. General Yang Yong's speech at the state banquet hosted by Premier Kim Il-sung to bid farewell to the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers this evening is as follows:

　　Respected Premier Kim Il-sung,
　　Dear leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government,
　　Dear comrades,

　　During the farewell period of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Pyongyang, we were warmly entertained by the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the state, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and enthusiastically bid farewell by the heroic people of Pyongyang. These past two days, we have been immersed in a warm ocean, reliving the friendship forged with blood and sweat by the Chinese and Korean people over the past eight years. Today, the respected Premier is again hosting a state banquet to send us off, which moves us even more deeply. At this moment, thousands of words cannot express our sorrow of farewell and our gratitude!

　　Over the past few years, the meticulous care and love shown to our officers and soldiers by the Korean people, the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and Premier Kim Il-sung, and the extremely vivid internationalist education given to our army, have been an important source of achievement for our army's combat and work over the past eight years. Premier, it is precisely because of this care and love from you and the entire Korean people that we have been able to live as if we were in our own homeland even when far away from our motherland. Please allow me to take this opportunity to once again express our heartfelt gratitude to you and the Korean people.

　　Dear comrades, tomorrow we will be filled with the friendship between China and Korea, leave the heroic Pyongyang, leave the beautiful Korean mountains and rivers, and return to our own country. This eve of departure is a day that will forever be remembered and forever unforgettable. Eight years ago today, the heroic Pyongyang was under the ravages of the enemy, but today, the heroic Pyongyang has restored its youthful appearance, built up from the ruins destroyed by the war, and is even more magnificent and majestic than before the war. Eight years ago today, was the eve of the war when our army unveiled the prelude to the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; and today, we have completed the mission given to us by the people of the motherland and returned home victoriously.

　　Dear comrades! From all the changes we have personally experienced in the past eight years, we have come to this conclusion: No force can stop the advancement of our just cause! We firmly believe that the heroic Korean people's cause of peaceful reunification will surely be realized! The shameless interference of the U.S. aggressors in our country and in Korea will inevitably be crushed! Our two peoples are jointly pulling the noose around the neck of the United States, and if the U.S. aggressors do not repent, we know how to work together to tighten this noose until it is strangled to death.

　　Comrades! Now I propose a toast:

　　To the further consolidation and development of the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people forged with blood;

　　To the early realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea by the Korean people;

　　To the high-speed advancement of the Korean people's socialist construction;

　　To the health of Premier Kim Il-sung;

　　To the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union;

　　To world peace!

    千言万语也难表达惜别之情
    杨勇上将在金日成首相举行的国宴上的讲话
    新华社平壤24日电　杨勇上将今晚在金日成首相欢送志愿军总部国宴上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的金日成首相同志亲爱的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府诸位领导同志亲爱的同志们：
    中国人民志愿军总部在平壤告别期间，受到以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党和国家领导人的盛情款待，受到了英雄的平壤人民的热情欢送。这两天来，我们一直沉浸在温暖的海洋中，重温着八年来中朝人民用血汗凝成的友谊。今天，敬爱的首相同志又亲设国宴为我们饯行，更深深地感动了我们。此时此刻，正是千言万语也难表达出我们的惜别和感激之情！
    几年来，朝鲜人民、朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相对我军官兵无微不至的关怀和爱护，给予我军的极其生动的国际主义教育，是八年来我军战斗、工作取得成就的一个重要源泉。首相同志：正是由于您和全体朝鲜人民的这种关怀爱护，使我们能够在远离祖国的情况下如同生活在自己的祖国一样。请允许我借此机会，向您和朝鲜人民再一次致以衷心的感谢。
    亲爱的同志们：明天，我们就将满载着中朝友谊，离开英雄的平壤、离开美丽的朝鲜山河，回到我们自己的祖国去了。这个离别的前夕，是一个永远值得纪念、永远使人难忘的日子。八年前的今天，英雄的平壤正处在敌人的蹂躏之下，而今天，英雄的平壤恢复了她的青春面貌，从遭到战争破坏的废墟上建设起来，并且比战前的平壤更加壮丽雄伟了。八年前的今天，正是我军揭开抗美援朝战争序幕的战争前夜；而今天，我们已经完成了祖国人民给予我们的使命，胜利返国了。
    亲爱的同志们！从我们八年来亲自经历的一切变化中，我们得出了这样一个结论：没有任何力量能阻挡我们的正义事业前进！我们坚定地相信英雄的朝鲜人民的和平统一事业一定能够实现！美国侵略者对我国和对朝鲜的无耻干涉，必然要被粉碎！我们两国人民正共同拉着套在美国脖子上的绞索，如果美国侵略者死不悔悟，我们是懂得怎样地同心协力拉紧这条绞索，直到把它绞死为止。
    同志们！现在我提议：
    为中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊进一步巩固与发展；
    为朝鲜人民早日实现祖国的和平统一；
    为朝鲜人民的社会主义建设事业高速度前进；
    为金日成首相的健康；
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结；
    为世界和平，干杯！
