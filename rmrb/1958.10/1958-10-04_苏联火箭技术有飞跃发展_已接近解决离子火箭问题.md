Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd dispatch: According to TASS, Professor Pokrovsky, a famous Soviet rocket technology expert, said that since the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite on October 4, 1957, Soviet rocket technology has made tremendous leaps and bounds.

He made these remarks while introducing the development prospects of interstellar transportation rockets to journalists at the Moscow Central House of Journalists. He said that the power of the rocket used to launch the Soviet Union's third satellite was hundreds of times greater than the rockets used by the United States to launch satellites. He also pointed out that the American intention to use their existing rocket technology to launch satellites to the moon without sufficient scientific and technological preparation can only be regarded as "a blind action, and another attempt may not be successful."

Speaking of the development prospects of rocket technology, Pokrovsky said that by using rockets, mankind can not only conquer space but also conquer time. In rockets moving at speeds close to the speed of light, the change of time will be very different from that on Earth. To reach this speed, thermal energy cannot be used in rockets, but ion rockets must be used. In ion rockets, positively and negatively charged particles can move strictly in a certain direction under the action of electricity, reaching speeds of tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometers per second. He said that the scientific community is now close to solving this problem. Now, the principle of ion rockets can be described as accurately as Tsiolkovsky described the principle of gasoline rockets in those years.

    苏联火箭技术有飞跃发展
    已接近解决离子火箭问题
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名火箭技术专家波克罗夫斯基教授说，从1957年10月4日第一个人造地球卫星发射以来，苏联火箭技术有了巨大的飞跃。
    这是他在莫斯科中央新闻工作者之家对新闻记者介绍星际交通火箭发展前景时说的。他说，发射苏联第三个卫星用的火箭的功率，比美国发射卫星使用的火箭大几百倍。他还指出，美国人打算在没有足够的科学技术准备的情况下利用他们现有的火箭技术发射卫星到月球去，这只能认为是“一种盲目行动，再次尝试也未必能成功”。
    在谈到火箭技术发展前景时，波克罗夫斯基说，利用火箭，人类不仅可以征服空间，而且可以征服时间。在以接近光速的速度运动的火箭中，时间的变化将同地球上有很大不同。要达到这种速度就不能在火箭中利用热能，而要利用离子火箭。在离子火箭中，带阳电和阴电的粒子在电力作用下可以严格地按照一定方向运动，而达到每秒几万和几十万公里的速度。他说，现在科学界已经接近于这个问题的解决。现在已经可以像当年齐奥尔科夫斯基叙述汽油火箭的原理一样精确地叙述离子火箭的原理了。
