Xinhua News Agency, 7th: From 6:00 PM on October 6th to 6:00 AM on October 7th, seven American warships and twenty-six aircraft continued to intrude into the territorial waters and airspace over the Xiamen area of Fujian Province. In response, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue the twenty-fourth serious warning and released the following statement:

The intrusion of American warships and aircraft into our territorial waters and airspace after our military ceased shelling Jinmen at 1:00 AM on October 6th until before dawn on the 7th is impermissible. However, after 6:00 AM on October 7th, there were no incidents of American warships or aircraft intruding into the territorial waters and airspace over the Xiamen area throughout the day. This is noteworthy as a response to the demand that the United States cease its escort activities. China is willing to resolve the international disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area through peaceful negotiations. If the United States does not intentionally interfere in China's internal affairs and also shares the same desire for peaceful negotiations, then it should first completely cease its so-called escort activities, stop infringing upon our territorial waters and airspace, and cease all military provocations and threats of war against our country.

Since the 6th, our military has ceased shelling Jinmen. Judging from reactions from all sides, the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu have expressed warm welcome. However, the Taiwan authorities say they would rather risk being shelled than have the United States withdraw its escort. It is understandable that the Taiwan authorities have long been bound by preconceived notions and rely on the United States as a backer, hence this kind of thinking. We hope that the Taiwan authorities value peace and prioritize patriotism. The supply problem of Jinmen can be solved by themselves, and Americans should not be asked to provide escorts. Chinese affairs should be solved by the Chinese themselves and should not be interfered with by the Americans. The Americans have their own plans. Problems between Chinese people can always be resolved reasonably through negotiations.

    我就七日六时前美舰美机继续挑衅提第二十四次警告
    美国应完全停止护航和挑衅
    并正告台湾当局以和平为贵以爱国为重
    新华社7日讯　从10月6日18时至7日6时止，有美国军舰七艘、飞机二十六架继续侵入我福建厦门地区的领海和领海上空，对此，我外交部发言人奉命第二十四次提出严重警告，并且发表谈话如下：
    在10月6日一时我军停止炮击金门以后，直至7日凌晨以前，美国的军舰和飞机还侵入我国领海和领海上空，这是不能容许的。但是，10月7日6时以后，在厦门地区的领海和领海上空，终日没有发现美舰美机侵入的事件。作为要求美国停止护航的一个反应，这是值得注意的事。中国愿意通过和平谈判，同美国解决中美之间在台湾地区的国际争端。如果美国不是蓄意干涉中国内政，而且也具有进行和平谈判的同样愿望的话，那么，它就应该首先完全停止所谓护航活动，停止侵犯我国的领海和领空，停止对我国的一切军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    我军从6日起，停止炮击金门，从各方反映看来，台、澎、金、马的军民都表示热烈的欢迎。但是，台湾当局却说宁愿冒着炮击的危险，也不愿美国退出护航。台湾当局长期以来囿于成见，以美国为靠山，因而有这种想法，这是可以理解的。我们希望台湾当局以和平为贵，以爱国为重。金门的供应问题，可以自己解决，不应该要美国人护航。中国人的事，应该由中国人自己解决，不应该让美国人干涉。美国人有美国人的打算。中国人之间的问题，总可以通过谈判取得合理解决。
