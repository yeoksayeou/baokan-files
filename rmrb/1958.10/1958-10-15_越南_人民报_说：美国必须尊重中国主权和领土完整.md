Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th. Vietnam's "People's Daily" today published a commentary on the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's October 13th order for the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front to cease shelling Jinmen for another two weeks, pointing out that this humanitarian approach by the Chinese government is another proof of China's strength and confidence in victory.

The commentary said that the order to cease shelling Jinmen for another two weeks is not a "trick." It is a measure taken against the United States.

The commentary emphasized that China has once again created favorable conditions for a peaceful resolution of China's internal affairs. The commentary stated that the only way out for U.S. imperialism at present is to abandon the practice of confusing China's internal affairs with the disputes between China and the United States, and honestly negotiate with China on the basis of respecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. If U.S. imperialism continues to be stubborn, they cannot avoid suffering a disastrous defeat.

    越南“人民报”说：
    美国必须尊重中国主权和领土完整
    新华社河内14日电　越南“人民报”今天就中国国防部13日命令福建前线中国人民解放军对金门炮击再停两星期发表评论，指出中国政府这种人道主义的作法，是中国力量强大和对胜利充满信心的又一个证明。
    评论说，再停炮击金门两星期的命令并不是什么“诡计”。这是针对美国而采取的措施。
    评论强调说，中国已经再一次为和平解决中国内政问题创造了有利的条件。评论说，美帝国主义的当前的唯一出路是必须放弃把中国内政问题同中美之间的争端混为一谈的做法，老老实实地在尊重中国主权和领土完整的基础上，同中国进行谈判。如果美帝国主义继续顽固下去，他们就不能避免遭到惨重的失败。
