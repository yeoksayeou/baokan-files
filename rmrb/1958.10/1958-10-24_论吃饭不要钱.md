On Eating Without Money

    Took the First Step
    As for the conditions for our commune to implement the grain supply system, I think we have them all. First, everyone has improved their communist consciousness. Don't you see everyone has been shouting about working without remuneration for a long time? Second, this year's grain harvest, after deducting public grain purchases and all other expenses, still leaves a substantial surplus per capita.
    People are eager to implement the grain supply system not just because it's a novelty, but mainly because they feel it has many advantages. Think about it: everyone has an iron rice bowl, no one has to worry about food anymore, and they can concentrate on production, making everyone's life better and better.
    You might say, will this cause slackers to be even lazier, making some people less active in production? I don't think so. Being a slacker is a matter of ideology, a manifestation of low consciousness. If someone becomes less active in production because of eating without money, it's also because their thinking is backward. People with backward thinking will have backward manifestations even if eating without money is not implemented. The grain supply system does not encourage the development of backward thinking; rather, collective life and communist distribution methods make it easier to conduct collectivist education for individuals with backward thoughts.
    People can't wait for communism to come sooner. The conditions are not yet sufficient to fully live a communist life, but with sufficient grain, we have taken the first step. Don't underestimate the simplicity of eating without money; it's touched the edge of communism. This is a threshold, but crossing this step is very important. Communism can only be reached step by step by our own efforts! (Liu Zaijin, Lixian, Hebei)
    
    A Step Towards Communism
    I used to only see things from my immediate perspective, feeling that I couldn't eat as much as others could produce, so I would suffer if a food supply system was introduced. But thinking about it in the long run, when I get old and enter the happiness home, won't I be supported by everyone? This is me working for everyone, and everyone working for me. If I don't even want to take the first step, how can I enter the gate of communism? My previous thoughts were really wrong.
      (Tong Meng, a middle peasant of the Dongfanghong People's Commune, Yichun, Jiangxi)

    Will Eating Grain Without Money Affect Enthusiasm?
    Some wealthy middle peasants are always clamoring: "Implementing grain ration supply will dampen people's enthusiasm for production." In our opinion, if we don't implement the grain ration supply system now, it will really affect the production enthusiasm of some people. Among the 37 households in the Guangxingdian production team, 8 are short of grain, and 5 can barely make ends meet. These households are not only not motivated to produce because of the small amount of grain for many people, but also directly delay several hundred working days in dealing with eating; but some wealthy middle peasants rely on their strong labor force, doing less is enough to eat, but they are often absent. Those few wealthy middle peasants are pursuing individualism and capitalist enthusiasm, not collectivist and socialist enthusiasm. They only want personal prosperity, regardless of the life and death of others, and even want to develop capitalism. They are active in production when it is beneficial to themselves, and passive when it is beneficial to others and everyone. But what about the vast majority of us? We are all for the collective, for socialism, we rarely do it for ourselves, and even when it is detrimental to ourselves, we are still active in production.
    (Statements made by members of the Hongqi Commune in Pingquan, Hebei, at a debate on the issue of "eating without money")
   
    Having Eaten the Commune's Food
    Having eaten the commune's food,
    We must work harder and harder,
    The more we work, the better our lives will be,
    No one wants to be a slacker.
   (Hongqi Commune, Shapingba District, Chongqing)
    Since eating without money was implemented,
    The rural atmosphere has greatly changed;
    When men hear about eating without money,
    Their bodies are full of energy bursting through the sky;
    When women hear about eating without money,
    They work even faster than the men;
    When the elderly hear about eating without money,
    They refuse to admit they are old and compete to be the first;
    When the young hear about eating without money,
    They work hard and study diligently to achieve remarkable results;
    When widowers hear about eating without money,
    Their faces are filled with spring breeze and smiles;
    When patients hear about eating without money,
    Their ailments are immediately reduced by half;
    When slackers hear about eating without money,
    They immediately change after repeated self-criticism;
    When working, thinking about eating without money,
    Every second and minute is raced for;
    When sleeping, thinking about eating without money,
    The more you think about it, the sweeter your heart becomes;
    Why does your heart become sweeter and sweeter?
    Communism is about to be realized!
    Everyone is full of enthusiasm,
    Everyone is moving forward together,
    Next year there will definitely be more "without money".
    (Mazhen People's Commune, Jiangyin, Jiangsu)

    The Benefits of Eating Without Money
    Two Peace of Minds—Peace of mind in production, peace of mind in life;
    Three Goods—Good unity and mutual assistance, good common prosperity,
              Good consolidation of the commune.
    Four Improvements—Improvement in communist consciousness,
              Improvement in living standards,
              Improvement in labor attendance rate,
              Improvement in production quality.
              (Xiasah People's Commune, Nanhui, Jiangsu)

    论吃饭不要钱
    走了第一步
    要说我们这公社实行粮食供给制的条件，我看是都有了，第一，大家都提高了共产主义觉悟，你看大家不是早就在嚷劳动不计报酬了吗？第二，今年收下的粮食，除掉公购粮和其它一切开支外，每人平均口粮还有很多富裕。
    人们急着要实行粮食供给制，也并不只是这是新鲜事，主要还是觉得它好处多。你想：人人都有了铁饭碗，谁也不用再为吃饭发愁了，一心一意闹生产；使大家生活越变越好。
    你说这会不会引起懒汉更偷懒，使得一些人生产不积极了？我看不会，懒汉偷懒是思想问题，是觉悟不高的表现，要是因为实行吃饭不要钱就不积极生产了，也是思想落后。有落后思想的人，即使不实行吃饭不要钱也会有落后的表现。粮食供给制并不助长落后思想的发展，而是集体生活，共产主义的分配方式，更便于向个别思想落后的人进行集体主义教育。
    人们恨不得共产主义早些来，现在条件还不够，不能全面过共产主义生活，但是粮食充足了，就走了第一步。别看吃饭不要钱这事简单，它可是沾上了共产主义的边，这是一个门槛，但跨过这一步是很要紧的。共产主义总得靠咱们自己一步一步地走才能到的啊！　（河北蠡县刘载金）
    共产主义的台阶
    原来我总从眼前看，觉得自己作得过人家，吃不过人家，实行伙食供给制，要吃亏。但从远里一想，老了我进幸福院，还不是要大家供养，这就是我为人人，人人为我。连第一步台阶都不想上，可怎么能走进共产主义大门里去呢？我先前的想法是真的不对。
      （江西宜春东方红人民公社中农童猛）
    吃粮不要钱会影响积极性吗？
    有些富裕中农老是叫嚷：“实行口粮供给会打击人们的生产积极性。”依我们看呀，现在如果不实行口粮供给制，才会真的影响一部分人的生产积极性。广兴店生产队的三十七户中，就有八户缺粮，五户勉强够吃，这些户不光因为人多粮少不够吃而生产不起劲，还为操持吃的直接耽误了二几百个劳动日；可是有的富裕中农依仗自己的劳力多，少干点也够吃，却经常缺勤。那些少数富裕中农，追求的是个人主义和资本主义的积极性，不是集体主义和社会主义的积极性，是只为了个人生活富裕，不管别人死活，甚至想发展资本主义，他们在对自己有利的时候生产就积极，在对别人对大家有利的时候就消极。可是我们绝大多数人呢，我们都是为了集体、为了社会主义，我们很少是为了个人，甚至是对个人不利的时候，生产也是积极的。
    （河北平泉红旗公社社员在“吃饭不要钱”问题的辩论会上讲的话）
    吃了公社的饭
    吃了公社的饭，更要加油的干，
    越干生活越好，谁也不愿当懒汉。
   （重庆沙坪坝区红旗公社）
    自从实行吃饭不要钱自从实行吃饭不要钱，农村风气大改变；男的听到吃饭不要钱，浑身干劲冲破天；女的听到吃饭不要钱，做活赶在男人前；老的听到吃饭不要钱，不服年老也争先；小的听到吃饭不要钱，勤工俭学成绩显；鳏寡听到吃饭不要钱，满面春风开笑颜；病人听到吃饭不要钱，毛病顿时轻一半；懒汉听到吃饭不要钱，连声检讨就改变；做活想到吃饭不要钱，一分一秒都争先；睡觉想到吃饭不要钱，越想心里越是甜；为什么心里越想越是甜？共产主义快实现！人人干劲足，个个齐向前，明年定有更多的不要钱。（江苏江阴马镇人民公社）
    吃饭不要钱的好处
    两安心——生产安心，生活安心；
    三　好——团结互助好，共同富裕好，
              巩固公社好。
    四提高——共产主义觉悟提高，
              生活水平提高，
              劳动出勤率提高，
              生产质量提高。
              （江苏南汇下沙人民公社）
