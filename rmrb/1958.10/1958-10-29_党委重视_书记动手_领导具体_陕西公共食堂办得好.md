    Party Committee Attaches Importance, Secretary Takes Action, Leaders Take Concrete Action
    Shaanxi's Public Canteens are Well-Run
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an on the 28th) Shaanxi Province has now established more than 105,000 public canteens, basically achieving canteenization, with participation accounting for 80% of the total number of farming households.
    Shaanxi Province's rural public canteens include several different organizational forms. Permanent fixed canteens based on one village and one team are the most developed, accounting for more than 60%. Canteens established according to the different ages and physical strengths of the masses, such as those in Hua County, Fuping, and Sanyuan, which are specifically for the elderly, postpartum women, and children, are very popular. In the sparsely populated areas of southern and northern Shaanxi, small mobile canteens have been established, and as the production team works, the canteen sets up camp and cooks on the spot.
    The biggest benefit of these canteens is that they have fully liberated the vast rural female labor force. In the past, of Shaanxi's three million female laborers, about one-third could not regularly or did not participate in field production at all due to being busy with household chores such as grinding flour and cooking. Now, with "canteenization" in various places, 90% of women participate in labor. For example, in Dali County, which was the first to implement canteenization, since each commune and team established public canteens, a total of 30,000 women have been freed up to participate in production, and each person's working days have more than doubled compared to the past. The establishment of public canteens has also greatly saved on food, firewood, oil, salt, and other expenses, and has promoted the cultivation of the masses' collective consciousness and communist ideology.
    The rapid development of rural public canteens in Shaanxi Province, and the fact that the vast majority are warmly welcomed and supported by the masses, and have been steadily consolidated and improved, is primarily due to the importance attached by the Party Committee, which has included canteens and other collective welfare activities on the agenda. In July and August of this year, the Party branch secretaries of various districts and townships in the Guanzhong area personally took the lead in establishing canteens in their own workplaces, dispelling the ideological concerns of a small number of the masses and township cadres, and solving various specific problems.
    After "canteenization," in order to ensure that the canteens were well-run, each county also designated a county Party secretary to be specifically responsible for leading the collective welfare life of the people's communes; many people's communes universally established collective life offices, welfare committees, and other organizations to specifically manage public canteens, nurseries, and other work, ensuring the consolidation and improvement of the canteens from the organizational level.
    Shaanxi also made extensive use of on-site meetings, experience exchange meetings, and other forms to help cooks and managers improve their skills and run collective meals well. The Yao Bei Brigade canteen of the Chaomei People's Commune in Fuping County was doing a good job, and the county and commune held two on-site meetings to introduce and promote the advanced experiences of this canteen, such as raising its own pigs, having a variety of dishes, and having a reasonable management system, which promoted many of the poorer-performing canteens in the area. The Weiqu People's Commune in Chang'an County organized cooks in the brigade canteens to hold "Zhuge Liang Meetings" and "Tang Sanzang Pilgrimage Meetings" to exchange experiences and lessons learned, which also had a good effect.
    In order to improve the efficiency of canteen work and reduce the heavy labor of cooks, Shaanxi also mobilized the masses to make suggestions and come up with ideas, and actively improved and created various good and fast cooking utensils. Li Qinglan and Li Yuecai, members of the Lichao People's Commune in Dali County, created a vegetable cutter and a steamed bun slicing machine to replace manual operation and improve work efficiency by twenty to forty times; farmers in Heyang County also made advanced cooking utensils such as rotary noodle cutters and hand-cranked vegetable slicers. At present, the ratio of cooks to workers in canteens in Shaanxi is generally four women to one man, with men taking on the heavy work such as fetching water and burning firewood.
    Some commune canteens in Hanzhong, Fuping, and other places have recently started to grow their own vegetables and raise their own pigs, chickens, and ducks, adopting the method of unified planting, unified raising, and unified eating to improve meals.
    As the severe winter is approaching, public canteens in Shaanxi Province, especially in the mountainous areas of the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, are taking various active measures to ensure that the canteens "safely" survive the winter and that the members eat their fill and stay warm. Many canteens in Shanyang, Luonan, Zhen'an, and other places in southern Shaanxi, which originally ate in open-air fields, are now using rice straw and wild thatch to build sheds, and some plan to mobilize the masses to free up spare rooms for use as dining halls. Some canteens in the more concentrated residential areas of Guanzhong will add firewood for heating, while others are preparing to use cattail baskets and rice cookers and other utensils to take meals home from the canteen for consumption.

### 党委重视　书记动手　领导具体  陕西公共食堂办得好

    党委重视　书记动手　领导具体
    陕西公共食堂办得好
    本报西安28日电　陕西省现在共建立了十万五千多个公共食堂，基本上实现了食堂化，参加入伙的占总农户的80％。
    陕西省的农村公共食堂，包括几种不同的组织形式。以一村一队为单位的常年固定食堂，这是其中发展最多的，约占60％以上。根据群众不同年龄和身体强弱等特点办的食堂，例如华县、富平、三原等地办的专为老年、产妇和幼儿食用的食堂，深受大家欢迎。在山大人稀的陕南、陕北地区，建立有流动性的小型食堂，随着生产队做活，食堂便就地扎营做饭。
    这些食堂办起以后，最大的好处是充分解放了广大农村的妇女劳动力。过去陕西三百万妇女劳动力，因忙于磨面做饭等家庭事务，约有三分之一不能经常或根本不参加田间生产，现今各地“食堂化”了，90％的妇女参加了劳动。如食堂化最早的大荔县，自从各社、队办了公共食堂，共腾出了三万名妇女参加生产，每个人所做劳动日都比以往增加一倍多。公共食堂的成立，还大大节省了粮食和柴火、油盐等开支，对培养农民群众集体观念和共产主义思想也起了促进作用。
    陕西省农村公共食堂发展迅速，并且绝大部分受到群众热烈欢迎和支持，得到了稳步巩固和提高。首要一个原因是党委重视，把食堂等集体福利生活列入了议事日程。今年7、8月间，关中地区各区、乡党支书记亲自在自己工作所在地带头办食堂，打通少数群众和乡干部的思想顾虑，解决各类具体问题。
  “食堂化”后，各县为了使食堂办的好，又指定一名县委书记专门负责领导人民公社的集体福利生活；许多人民公社普遍设立了集体生活办公室、福利委员会等组织，专门管理公共食堂、托儿所等工作，从组织上层层保证了食堂的巩固和提高。
    陕西各地还大量采用现场会议、经验交流会议等形式，帮助炊事管理人员提高业务、办好集体伙食。富平县超美人民公社姚北大队食堂办得出色，县上和公社便两次召开现场会议，介绍和推广这个食堂自己养猪，饭菜花样多和管理制度合理等先进经验，推动了当地许多原来工作较差的食堂。长安县韦曲人民公社以大队食堂为单位，组织炊事员们开“诸葛亮会”“唐僧取经会”，相互交流经验教训，效果也很好。
    为了提高食堂工作效率，减轻炊事人员过重劳动，陕西各地又在发动群众提建议、想办法，积极改进和创造各种又好又快的炊具。大荔县荔潮人民公社社员李清兰、李月彩等创造了一种切菜器和切馍机，代替手工操作，提高工作效率二十倍到四十倍；郃阳县农民也做出了圆盘切面刀、手摇切菜机等先进炊具。目前，陕西各地食堂的炊事员的比例一般是四女一男，挑水、烧火等重活由男的担任。
    汉中、富平等地一部分公社食堂，最近还开始了自己种菜、自己养猪养鸡鸭，采取统一种、统一养、统一吃的办法，改善伙食。
    严冬即将来到，陕西省特别是秦岭、巴山山区里的公共食堂，都在采取各种积极措施，保证食堂“安全”过冬，使社员们吃得又饱又暖，陕南山阳、雒南、镇安等地许多食堂原来在露天场上吃饭，现正利用稻草和野茅草盖搭草棚，有的计划发动群众腾出多余空房来作饭堂。关中居住比较集中的一些食堂，有的将增添取暖柴火，有的准备使用蒲篮和饭锅等器具，各自从食堂打饭回家食用。（孙传镐）
