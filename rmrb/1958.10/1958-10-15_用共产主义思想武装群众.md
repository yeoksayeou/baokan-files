    Arm the Masses with Communist Ideology
    Zeng Dun
    The communist sprouts in our actual life are constantly developing and growing. This is due to the unprecedented improvement of people's political consciousness through the nationwide rectification campaign, which has brought about a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The leap forward in the development of productive forces further requires the adjustment of production relations and the relationship between people, so that industrial and agricultural production can achieve greater leaps forward. Thus, the People's Commune movement has been launched. Although the People's Commune is still a collective ownership system, it is an organization that combines the township and the commune, containing elements of ownership by the whole people and making people's lives more collective, and weakening the role of the family even further. Furthermore, the movement of the whole people running iron and steel is tempering people in combat-oriented industrial production, eliminating the differences between workers and peasants, cities and villages, and forming a huge new force of the working class. People's ideology, consciousness, and living habits are also undergoing major changes accordingly. In order to enable people to more consciously adapt to this major change and reduce certain ideological obstacles and resistance from habitual forces in the change, it is necessary to carry out a wide-ranging and in-depth communist education movement in conjunction with the current practical struggles and the ideological situation of the masses.
  Establishing a Strong Production Viewpoint and Labor Viewpoint are Conditions for Laying the Material Foundation of Communism
    Communist education should make cadres and the masses fully realize that a strong material foundation is necessary to fully consolidate the socialist system and transition to a happy communist society. This requires establishing an unwavering production viewpoint and labor viewpoint, and it must be clearly recognized that the importance of developing production during the socialist construction period is of greater significance than during the period of large-scale and fierce class struggle. Now, private plots, large farm implements, and large livestock as remnants of the rural capitalist economy have been eliminated, and families as individual economic production units are undergoing tremendous changes. The broad masses are enthusiastically yearning for the prospect of communism. Due to the socialization of life, the People's Commune directly shoulders the important function of managing the lives of the masses. Therefore, meeting the material and cultural needs of the broad masses has become an urgent task of the commune. This requires concentrating all efforts to increase production, ensure supply, and consolidate and expand the achievements of socialist revolution and construction. At the same time, the production viewpoint and labor viewpoint should be implemented in all work, and all work should be conducive to improving labor productivity and developing production. This is the most basic starting point for all work. To depart from this most basic starting point is to depart from politics. We should combine it with the publicity of long-term plans to make people understand that the beautiful communist society is no longer a distant future. Every specific labor of ours today is a foundation-laying work for communism. Today's hardship is precisely for tomorrow's happiness.
  Educate the Masses to Treat Current Production and Distribution Issues with a Communist Attitude
    Communist education should break down bourgeois rights concepts and establish a concept of equality between people. On the one hand, socialist society is growing communist factors, and on the other hand, there are remnants of bourgeois rights such as hierarchical concepts, employment concepts, privilege thinking, and even gender inequality and patriarchal systems. Clamor for position, treatment, wages, and work points are all inseparable from the remnants of bourgeois rights. Now, the possibility of developing a capitalist economy is getting smaller and smaller; after rectification, the remnants of bourgeois rights thinking have also been greatly impacted. However, if the remnants of bourgeois rights thinking are not completely eliminated, the development of individualism will still have extremely fertile soil. The currently implemented wage system, bonus system, etc., are all manifestations of the remnants of bourgeois rights. Although the existence of this system plays a certain role and is objectively necessary when the material and cultural foundation of communism is not yet available; however, it is also necessary to educate cadres and the masses to fully recognize that the current adoption of wage systems, bonus systems, etc., is only a transitional measure. Our ultimate goal is to deal with production and distribution issues in accordance with the communist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". At present, we must do our best in production, work selflessly, and be public-minded, and we should not haggle over distribution except for ensuring certain basic living needs. This requires continuously improving communist consciousness, treating current production and distribution issues with a communist attitude, consciously creating conditions, actively establishing a brand-new relationship between people, a brand-new attitude towards labor and living habits, and striving to move from formal equality to factual equality as soon as possible.
  Workers and Peasants Become Knowledgeable, Intellectuals Become Laborers
  Eliminate the Differences Between Mental and Physical Labor
    Gradually eliminate the differences between mental and physical labor, urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, especially to make workers and peasants knowledgeable and intellectuals laborers. This is an important symbol of completing the cultural revolution. Among cadres and intellectuals, we must conscientiously implement the long-term policy of combining mental and physical labor and combining education with productive labor. At present, some people still have varying degrees of resistance to this policy, and they must be educated in practical work to correct their understanding. We should also know that it is impossible to realize communism with only a rich material foundation and without a high level of scientific culture. Therefore, while advocating that cadres and intellectuals participate in physical labor, we must vigorously eliminate illiteracy and rapidly improve the scientific and cultural level of worker-peasant cadres and the masses to meet the needs of the development of the situation. We want to make everyone a person who is comprehensively developed in morality, intelligence, and physical education, and make everyone a cultured laborer with socialist and communist awareness; and even become an all-rounder with one specialty and multiple skills, one specialty and multiple techniques, and one specialty and multiple arts. Everyone is also a worker and a farmer, able to write and fight, able to write and sing. We want to make the unequal phenomenon of "those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others" disappear for thousands of years.
  Use the Communist Spirit of Selflessness
  To Fight Against Localism and Individualism
    Further carry out the struggle between communism and localism and individualism, and establish a communist outlook on life of "everyone for me, me for everyone," mutual support, common rise, and common prosperity. We have already embodied the communist spirit of urban-rural cooperation, industrial-agricultural cooperation, mutual support, and selflessness in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production; many people can consciously cherish public property and unconditionally undertake voluntary labor; communist morality of mutual love and sharing weal and woe among regions and comrades has also been significantly promoted. However, there are also some people who still have serious localism and individualism, manifested as emphasizing the interests of small collectives and neglecting the interests of large collectives; emphasizing partial interests and neglecting overall interests; emphasizing individual hard work and disregarding the suffering of other comrades. Therefore, we should educate cadres and the masses to clearly define the overall viewpoint of proceeding from 600 million people, break the partial viewpoint, regard 600 million people as a large commune, as a socialist and communist big family, and regard the difficulties and sufferings of each person in it as their own, so as to care for and support them. Adhere to the principle of small truths obeying great truths, and resolutely oppose localism, individualism, and partial viewpoints. In addition, we should also educate the people to cherish public property and maintain public order. Gradually use communist ideology to overcome all kinds of erroneous thoughts left over from private ownership.
  Emphasize Centralized Unity and Oppose Decentralism
  Cultivate a High Degree of Consciousness and Discipline
    Marching towards nature is a great and arduous struggle, and we must fight in an organized and planned manner, and we must uniformly allocate and concentrate the use of labor, tools, and materials in order to ensure the breakthrough of one central link after another. We should have a high degree of consciousness and discipline in this regard. Of course, without hindering the principle of unified concentration, we must also maximize the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels and various departments. Emphasize that the partial obeys the whole, the individual obeys the collective, and oppose decentralism. The more production develops and the more science develops, the more we must strengthen organization and discipline. This is the objective law of the development of things. If people consciously recognize it, adapt to it, and master it, they will have the greatest freedom. Conversely, they will feel "restricted and unfree." At present, the People's Commune is realizing organizational militarization and action combatization, and is organizing the "industrial army" that Marx spoke of. Facts have proved that the implementation of militarization and combatization is more conducive to rapid action and improved efficiency, ensuring the victory of socialist and communist construction. At the same time, because US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek are still attempting to invade us at all times, and Taiwan, the motherland, has not yet been liberated, our implementation of militarization, combatization, and universal armament can resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the enemy when necessary.
  Combine Communist Education with
  Solving Realistic Problems in Life
    Communist education should be combined with solving realistic problems in life. We must educate the masses to see the beautiful and happy prospects, not to be short-sighted and confined to a narrow circle. We must educate the masses with the overall plan of the unit, the region, the province, and the country, explaining that our realization of the plan is to accelerate socialist construction and create conditions for the transition to communism. In a communist society, social products are extremely abundant, people's communist consciousness and moral qualities are greatly improved, culture and education are greatly popularized and greatly improved, everyone can freely choose their profession, the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and physical and mental labor have disappeared, and the function of the state is only to deal with external enemies and mainly manage industrial and agricultural production, material and cultural life internally. This enters the "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" communist society of common prosperity. Communist education lies in making every member of the masses clear about this goal, reaching a broad vision, an open mind, and consciously struggling hard to achieve this great goal. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out education to care about the realistic lives of the masses. The purpose of socialist production is originally to maximize the satisfaction of the people's material and cultural needs. The People's Commune cannot ignore the realistic lives of the masses, but should put the collective welfare undertakings of the masses on the agenda of party committees at all levels. In particular, the leading cadres of the People's Commune should pay unified attention to and strengthen the leadership of leading the masses in production and managing the lives of the masses. Due to the socialization of family labor, many family affairs have been transferred to the commune. The quality of these welfare undertakings is directly related to the vital interests of the people, the speed of production and construction, and the consolidation and development of the People's Commune. Therefore, collective welfare undertakings are essentially a major political issue of the whole people. Some people do not have enough understanding of this, have feelings of boredom, and even disdain to manage it, which is obviously very wrong.
  A Basic Content of Communist Education
  Study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's Works
    Conscientiously studying Marxism-Leninism, especially Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and establishing a dialectical materialist and historical materialist worldview is also one of the basic contents of communist education. Advocate that the whole party and the whole people further learn to use the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method to observe problems, and thoroughly criticize idealism, superstition, and subjectivism in actual work. Advocate proceeding from reality, conducting thorough investigation and research, and adhering to the study method and research method of "taking the actual problems of the Chinese revolution as the center and guiding it with the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism." Oppose subjectivity and one-sidedness, and oppose the separation of theory from practice. Advocate using Marxist-Leninist theory as a weapon, summarizing practical experience, forming theory, and using it to guide practice. Comrades with rich practical experience should conscientiously study theory, avoid mistaking partial experience for universal truth, and eliminate the limitations of specific experience; comrades with little practical experience should strengthen practice and avoid the mistakes of dogmatism. All comrades should fully recognize the subjective dynamic role of people in changing the objective world, fully recognize the great role of the people, correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the masses, and implement the party's mass line in all work.
    The communist education movement is a basic ideological construction work of our party and people as they begin to enter a new stage. Its purpose is to clear away ideological obstacles for the central task, so as to smoothly build socialism and lay the ideological foundation for gradually transitioning to communism.

    用共产主义思想武装群众
    曾惇
    现在我们实际生活中的共产主义萌芽，已在不断地发展和成长。这是由于经过全民性整风运动，人们的政治觉悟空前提高，带来了工农业生产的大跃进。生产力的飞跃发展，又进一步要求调整生产关系和人与人之间的关系，以便工农业生产能获得更大的跃进。这样，人民公社运动开展起来了。人民公社虽然还是集体所有制，但它是乡社合一的组织，包含着全民所有制的成分，并使人们的生活更加集体化，家庭的作用更加削弱了。而全民办钢铁的运动，又使人们经受着战斗性的工业生产的锻炼，消除着工人和农民、城市和乡村的差别，形成着一支庞大的新的工人阶级队伍。人们的思想意识和生活习惯也相应地发生着重大的变化。为着要使人们都能更加自觉地适应这一重大变革，减少变革中某些思想阻碍和习惯势力的抵抗，就需要结合当前的实际斗争和群众的思想情况，集中地开展一次广泛深入的共产主义教育运动。
  树立坚强的生产观点和劳动观点是奠定共产主义物质基础的条件
    共产主义教育要使干部和群众充分认识到：一定要有强大的物质基础，才能充分地巩固社会主义制度，并向幸福的共产主义社会过渡。这就必须树立坚定不移的生产观点和劳动观点，必须明确认识社会主义建设时期发展生产的重要性，较之大规模的激烈的阶级斗争时期，具有更加严重的意义。现在，自留地、大农具、大牲畜作为农村资本主义经济的残余已经被消灭了，作为个体经济生产单位的家庭也发生着巨大的变化，广大群众热忱地向往着共产主义的前景。由于生活社会化，人民公社直接担负着管理群众生活的重要职能，因而满足广大群众物质、文化生活的要求，已成为公社的迫切任务。这就需要集中一切力量增加生产，保证供应，巩固与扩大社会主义革命和建设的成果。同时，应该将生产观点、劳动观点贯彻到各项工作中去，各项工作都应当有利于提高劳动生产率和发展生产。这是各项工作的最基本的出发点。脱离了这个最基本的出发点，就是脱离政治。我们应该结合着远景规划的宣传，使人们懂得美好的共产主义社会，已经不是什么遥远的将来了。我们现在的每一具体的劳动，都是共产主义的奠基工作。今天的艰苦，正是为了明天的幸福。
  教育群众用共产主义的态度
  对待当前的生产和分配问题
    共产主义教育要破除资产阶级法权观念，树立人与人之间的平等观念。社会主义社会一方面生长着共产主义的因素，另一方面则残存着资产阶级法权等级观念、雇佣观念、特权思想，以至男女不平等和家长制，闹地位、闹待遇、争工资、争工分等等，都和资产阶级法权的残余分不开。现在，发展资本主义经济的可能性越来越小；经过整风，资产阶级法权思想的残余也已受到了很大的冲击。但是，如不彻底消灭资产阶级法权思想的残余，那么个人主义的发展就仍然有极其肥沃的土壤。目前实行的工资制度、奖金制度等，都是残存的资产阶级法权的表现。这种制度的存在，在共产主义的物质、文化基础尚未具备时，虽然具有一定的作用，而且是客观所必需的；但是，也必须教育干部和群众充分认识到，现在采用工资制奖金制等等只是一种过渡性质的措施，我们的最终目的，是要按照“各尽所能，各取所需”的共产主义原则，去处理生产和分配的问题。目前，我们在生产上要各尽所能，忘我劳动，公而忘私，在分配上除了保证一定的生活所需以外，则不应斤斤计较。这就必须不断提高共产主义觉悟，用共产主义态度对待当前的生产和分配问题，自觉地创造条件，积极地建立一种崭新的人与人的关系，崭新的劳动态度与生活习惯，争取早日从形式上的平等，转到事实上的平等。
  工农群众知识化知识分子劳动化
  消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别
    逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动、城市和乡村、工人和农民的差别，特别是要使工农知识化，知识分子劳动化，这是完成文化革命的重要标志。在干部和知识分子中要认真执行脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合、教育与生产劳动相结合的长期方针。现在有些人对于这个方针，还存在不同程度的抵触情绪，必须在实际工作中加以教育，端正认识。我们也应当知道，仅仅有了丰富的物质基础，没有高度的科学文化，要想实现共产主义是不可能的。因此，在提倡干部、知识分子参加体力劳动的同时，要大力扫除文盲，迅速提高工农干部和群众的科学文化水平，以适应形势发展的需要。我们要使每个人成为德育、智育、体育全面发展的人，使每个人都成为有社会主义、共产主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者；以至成为一专多能、一专多技、一专多艺的多面手。人人亦工亦农、能文能武、会写会唱。我们要使几千年来“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的不平等现象，归于泯灭。
  用大公无私的共产主义精神
  同本位主义、个人主义作斗争
    进一步开展共产主义同本位主义、个人主义的斗争，树立“人人为我，我为人人”，互相支援，共同高涨，共同富裕的共产主义人生观。我们已经在工农业生产大跃进中，体现了城乡协作、工农业协作、互相支援和大公无私的共产主义精神；许多人都能自觉地爱护公共财产，无条件地担任义务劳动；地区间、同志间互相友爱、同甘共苦的共产主义道德，也有了显著的发扬。但是，也有一些人，还存在着严重的本位主义、个人主义，表现为强调小集体的利益，忽视大集体的利益；强调局部利益，忽视整体利益；强调个人的多劳多得，不顾其他同志的疾苦。因此我们应当教育干部和群众，明确一切从六亿人民出发的全面观点，打破局部观点，把六亿人民看成一个大公社，看成一个社会主义、共产主义的大家庭，其中每一个人的困难和疾苦，就是自己的疾苦，从而去关心他，支援他。坚持小道理服从大道理的原则，坚决反掉本位主义、个人主义和局部观点。此外，还应当向人民群众进行爱护公共财产、维护公共秩序的教育。逐渐地用共产主义思想，去战胜私有制所遗留下来的种种错误思想。
  强调集中统一反对分散主义
  培养高度的自觉性和纪律性
    向大自然进军，是一个伟大的艰巨的斗争，必须有组织、有计划的作战，必须统一调配与集中使用劳动力、工具和物资，才能保证突破一个接连一个的中心环节。我们对此应当有高度的自觉性、纪律性。当然，在不妨碍统一集中的原则下，也要最大限度的发挥各级组织与各个部门的积极性。强调局部服从整体，个人服从集体，反对分散主义。生产愈发展，科学愈发达，愈要加强组织性、纪律性，这是事物发展的客观规律。如果人们自觉的去认识它、适应它、掌握它，就有最大的自由，反之，就会感到“受限制、不自由”。当前，人民公社正在实现组织军事化，行动战斗化，正在组织马克思所说的“产业大军”。事实证明了：实行军事化和战斗化，就更有利于迅速行动和提高效率，保证社会主义、共产主义建设的胜利。同时，因为美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石，还时时刻刻企图侵犯我们，祖国的台湾尚未解放，我们实行军事化、战斗化，实行全民武装，就能在必要时坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭敌人。
  把共产主义幸福前景的教育
  同解决现实生活问题结合起来
    共产主义的前景教育要和解决现实生活问题结合起来。我们要教育群众看到美丽幸福的前景，不要眼光短浅，局限于狭小的圈子里，要以本单位、本地区、以及本省和全国的全面规划，向群众进行教育，说明我们实现规划，就是为了加速社会主义建设，并且为过渡到共产主义创造条件。到共产主义社会，社会产品极大的丰富了，人们的共产主义觉悟和道德品质极大的提高了，文化教育也大大普及、大大提高了，人人都可以自由选择职业，工农差别、城乡差别、体力与脑力劳动的差别都已消失，国家的职能只是对付外部敌人的侵略，对内主要是管理工农业生产和物质、文化生活。这就进入了共同富裕的“各尽所能，各取所需”的共产主义社会。共产主义教育就在使每个群众都明确这个奋斗目标，达到眼界宽阔、胸襟开朗，并且自觉地为着实现这个伟大的目标艰苦奋斗。在此同时，还必须进行关心群众现实生活的教育。社会主义生产的目的本来是最大限度地满足人民物质、文化生活的需要。人民公社不能忽视群众的现实生活，而应当把群众的集体福利事业，提到各级党委议事日程上来。特别是人民公社的领导干部，更应当把领导群众的生产和管理群众的生活，统一的重视起来，加强领导。由于家庭劳动社会化，许多家庭的事务，转到公社方面来了，这些福利事业办得好坏，直接关系到人民群众的切身利益，关系到生产建设的速度和人民公社的巩固与发展。因此，集体福利事业，实质上是一个全民性的重大的政治问题。有的人对此认识不足，存在厌烦情绪，甚至不屑于去管它，显然是十分错误的。
  共产主义教育的一个基本内容
  学习马列主义和毛泽东的著作
    认真学习马克思列宁主义特别是毛泽东同志的著作，树立辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，也是共产主义教育的基本内容之一。提倡全党全民都进一步学会运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法去观察问题，彻底批判唯心主义、迷信思想和实际工作中的主观主义。提倡从实际出发，进行周密的调查研究，坚持“以中国革命的实际问题为中心，以马列主义的基本原则为指导”的学习方法与研究方法。反对主观性、片面性，反对理论与实际脱节。提倡用马克思列宁主义理论作武器，总结实践经验，形成理论，并以之来指导实践。实践经验多的同志应该认真学习理论，避免把局部经验误认为普遍真理，消除具体经验的局限性；实践经验少的同志应加强实践，避免教条主义的错误。全体同志都应该充分认识人在改变客观世界中的主观能动作用，充分认识人民群众的伟大作用，正确处理个人同群众的关系，把党的群众路线贯彻到各项工作中去。
    共产主义教育运动，是我们党和人民开始进入一个新阶段的一项基本的思想建设工作，其目的就是为中心任务扫除思想障碍，以便顺利地建成社会主义，并为逐步过渡到共产主义打下思想基础。
