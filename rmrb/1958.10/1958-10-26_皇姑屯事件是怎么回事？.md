What was the Huanggutun Incident?

In Marshal Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwanese compatriots, the Huanggutun Incident was mentioned, warning the Chiang Kai-shek clique to beware of the malicious American imperialism.

The Huanggutun Incident took place thirty years ago at the Huanggutun Railway Station southwest of Shenyang, where Japanese imperialism assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the Northeast warlord it had fostered.

The collusion between the reactionary warlord Zhang Zuolin and Japanese imperialism began during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Since the Opium War, China had become a target for international imperialist powers to carve up. At the same time, within China, due to the mutual contradictions and instigation of various imperialist powers, warlords engaged in years of continuous infighting for power and profit. In 1904, Tsarist Russia and Japanese imperialism broke out in war for control of Northeast China. Japanese imperialism bought large numbers of Chinese ruffians and bandits in the Northeast to work as spies for them, and Zhang Zuolin was one of them. At that time, Zhang Zuolin was one of the bandit leaders in the Northeast, and after being bought by the Japanese, he was driven by them. Later, Zhang Zuolin was highly appreciated by Japanese imperialists, and under their support, he became the Military Governor of Fengtian and the Inspector General of the three northeastern provinces, ruling the Northeast. Japanese imperialism also plundered the rich resources of Northeast China through Zhang Zuolin.

However, Japanese imperialism was not satisfied with this, but wanted to completely turn the Northeast into a Japanese colony, and then enter the pass and destroy all of China. It was not so confident in Zhang Zuolin. At that time, the Japanese Kwantung Army was stationed throughout the Northeast. Zhang Zuolin's every move was under the strict surveillance of Japanese imperialism. In April and May 1928, after Chiang Kai-shek, supported by British and American imperialism, fought with Zhang Zuolin in Beiping and Tianjin, the United States, in order to compete with Japan for the Northeast, instigated Chiang and Zhang to cooperate. Japanese imperialism, fearing that Zhang Zuolin's compromise with Chiang Kai-shek would be detrimental to itself, laid out a meticulous assassination plan while Zhang Zuolin was returning to Shenyang from Beijing. On June 4, 1928, when the train Zhang Zuolin was traveling on arrived at Huanggutun Railway Station southwest of Shenyang, explosives that had been pre-buried by the Japanese army exploded, precisely targeting the carriage in which Zhang Zuolin was sitting. Zhang Zuolin was seriously injured and died shortly thereafter. (Lin)

### 皇姑屯事件是怎么回事？

    皇姑屯事件是怎么回事？
    国防部长彭德怀元帅的告台湾同胞书中，提到了皇姑屯事件，要蒋介石集团当心恶毒的美帝国主义。
    皇姑屯事件是发生在三十年前的沈阳西南皇姑屯车站上，日本帝国主义在那里暗害了它一手扶植的东北军阀张作霖。
    反动军阀张作霖和日本帝国主义的勾结，开始于1904年日俄战争的时候。自从鸦片战争以后，中国就变为国际帝国主义的瓜分对象。同时，在中国国内，由于各个帝国主义相互矛盾和策动，各派军阀为了争权夺利进行了连年不断的混战。1904年，沙皇俄国与日本帝国主义为了争夺我国的东北而爆发了战争。日本帝国主义就在东北大量收买中国的流氓土匪替他们作侦探，张作霖就是其中的一个。那时候，张作霖是东北的土匪头子之一，受了日本收买后，受他们驱策。以后张作霖一直很受日本帝国主义者的赏识，并且在其一手扶植下作了奉天督军和东北三省的巡阅使，统治了东北。日本帝国主义也通过张作霖大量地掠夺我国东北的丰富资源。
    但是，日本帝国主义并不以此为满足，而是想把东北完全变为日本的殖民地，并进而入关灭亡全中国。它对张作霖并不那么放心。当时，日本关东军已经驻扎在东北各地。张作霖的一举一动，都在日本帝国主义的严密监视之下。1928年4、5月间，受英、美帝国主义支持的蒋介石同张作霖在北平、天津作战后，美国为了同日本争夺东北，策动蒋、张合作。日本帝国主义恐怕张作霖同蒋介石妥协后对自己不利，就趁张作霖从北京回沈阳的时候，布下了周密的刺杀计划。1928年6月4日，当张作霖乘坐的火车到达沈阳西南皇姑屯车站的时候，日军早已埋伏好的火药爆炸了，而且恰好炸在张作霖坐的那一节车厢上。张作霖当即受重伤，不久就死了。　　（霖）
