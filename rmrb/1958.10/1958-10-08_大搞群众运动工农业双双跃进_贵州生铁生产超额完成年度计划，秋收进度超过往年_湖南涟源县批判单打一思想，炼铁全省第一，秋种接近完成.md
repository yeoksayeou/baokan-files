　　Launch Mass Movements, Achieve Simultaneous Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture
　　Guizhou Overfulfills Annual Pig Iron Production Plan; Autumn Harvest Progress Exceeds Previous Years
　　Lianyuan County, Hunan, Criticizes "Going It Alone" Ideology, Ranks First in Province for Iron Smelting, Autumn Planting Nears Completion

　　(Our Guiyang dispatch) Reporter Xiao Ming comments: While focusing on steel production, can we also focus on agriculture? In regions where steel production is leaping forward rapidly, can the autumn harvest progress be equally fast? The experience gained in Guizhou Province in September proves that it is entirely possible.

　　In late September, the labor force put into blast furnace production increased sharply from 600,000 in early September to 3 million, accounting for more than one-third of the rural labor force, but the autumn harvest progress was faster than the same period last year.

　　How to solve the difficulties in the simultaneous advancement of industrial and agricultural production? According to the current progress in Guizhou Province, the primary thing is that the leadership must have determination, believe that the masses have the power to overcome all difficulties, and fully mobilize the masses so that every person understands the current situation and their tasks at the national, provincial, county, commune, and individual levels. It can now be seen from many regions that there is a rule: regions where steel production leaps forward quickly also have fast autumn harvest progress. Zunyi Prefecture leads the province in pig iron production, accounting for two-thirds of the province's output, and its autumn harvest progress is also the fastest in the province. The reason is that they fully mobilized the masses. Leaders at all levels personally took command, divided responsibilities, and directly led steel and agricultural production, which also guaranteed the simultaneous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

　　Secondly, from top to bottom, there must be both division of labor and collaboration. Moreover, this collaboration is based on the "three transformations" (militarization of labor organization, combatization of action, collectivization of life) achieved after the people's communes were established, and is motivated by the spirit of communism and the enthusiasm for building an industrialized motherland. After the "three transformations" were realized, labor efficiency was greatly improved. In the past, each person could harvest less than 0.5 mu of rice per day, but now the average is more than 1 mu. Suiyang County harvested more than 10% of the county's rice planting area overnight; Tianzhu County rushed to harvest all the rice in six days and nights. The "three transformations" have made labor mobilization very flexible and timely. During the day, they form a harvesting army, and at night they go to mine coal and transport materials. Fine weather is the golden time to seize the harvest, and blast furnace workers also form harvesting teams to support agriculture. Collaboration is also carried out between urban and rural areas, between high mountains and plains, and between early-maturing and late-maturing areas. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, whoever can spare manpower, go to seize the harvest and transport crops.

　　Fully mobilizing women is also one of the keys to achieving the double leap forward. Almost 100% of the more than 3 million women of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province have participated in labor. Since this spring, women have gradually become the main force in agricultural production. They account for 70%-80% of the labor force on the agricultural front, and each woman is responsible for about 9 mu of land. In the recent large-scale collaboration to prepare and transport grain and fodder for earthen blast furnaces, women accounted for about 50% of the labor force. Moreover, 50,000 women have been transferred to blast furnaces, and more than 2,000 women's furnaces have been put into production.

　　At present, agricultural and steel production in the province are both at the most intense stage. After overfulfilling the annual production plan for pig iron, the second campaign is being organized. In addition to continuing to seize the harvest, autumn plowing and sowing must be carried out vigorously, with deep plowing of 8 inches to 1 foot, which requires more manpower and animal power. Therefore, "Go all out for steel, do not slack on agriculture" is still the slogan of action for the entire province, the entire party, and all the people. The good results and experiences of September are the foundation for continuing to advance in October.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th) Lianyuan County, one of Hunan Province's iron smelting bases, has greatly broken the "two hands can only catch one fish" theory, enabling the county's iron smelting and grain production to soar together. On September 29, the county's daily pig iron output reached 2,513 tons, ranking first in the province. Currently, more than 250,000 farmers in the county are fighting on the iron mountains and steel transportation lines, and more than 160,000 farmers are fighting in the fields. The task of planting 250,000 mu of autumn crops has now been 90% completed. Manure accumulation had not even started at this time last year, but now an average of more than 200 dan of manure has been accumulated per mu. More than 20 larger reservoir projects have also started ahead of schedule.

　　When Lianyuan County began to vigorously engage in iron smelting, it coincided with the busy season of harvesting mid-season rice, with a shortage of 50,000 to 60,000 laborers. What to do? At that time, there were three views: some people believed that since "two hands cannot catch two fish anyway," if we want to vigorously engage in steel production, we have to relax agriculture; others believed that eating is the first priority, grain production is the first priority, and if we want to engage in steel production, it is enough to focus on a few large factories and mines; but most people believed that grasping steel with the right hand and grain with the left hand, and simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, is not contradictory, and if there is a shortage of labor, everyone should come up with ideas and carry out a technical revolution to solve it. Thus, a mass debate was launched throughout the county. The focus of the debate was: should we vigorously engage in steel production to support national industrialization? Will grasping steel affect the great leap forward in agriculture? How to solve the labor contradiction between the two? The debate reached a climax at the county-wide expanded cadre meeting held in mid-September. More than 3,000 county, township, and commune cadres participated in the meeting, posted more than 14,000 big-character posters, conducted five days of airing views and debates, and visited the Hongqi Commune. The Hongqi Commune extracted 70% of its labor force to smelt iron. Within half a month, the number of furnaces put into production increased from 26 to 68, and the daily pig iron output jumped from the original 3.2 tons to 20 tons. Because the labor force was well organized and arranged, the commune's agricultural production was not delayed either. The commune members on the agricultural front spent three days and three nights repairing 598 li of field transportation roads, adding more than 460 soil carts, basically realizing vehicle transportation, and harvesting more than 10,000 mu of mid-season rice three days ahead of schedule, and also rushed to plant more than 1,000 mu of autumn miscellaneous grain crops. Manure accumulation, deep plowing, and water conservancy projects were all done very well. Through the great debate and on-site visits, the cadres attending the meeting realized the interrelationship between industry and agriculture, realized that "it depends on people," and as long as the masses are mobilized to find ways, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Everyone was in a good mood and full of energy. They went back and mobilized the masses to rush to harvest the remaining mid-season rice in three days and nights. A total of 270,000 mu of mid-season rice in the county was harvested in about 20 days.

　　The main experiences of Lianyuan County in achieving simultaneous progress in steel and grain production are:

　　First, the county's labor force, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, formed a fighting whole, with overall planning and unified arrangements. Each of the county's 18 people's communes has three labor armies: one is the steel army, which accounts for about 70% of the commune's labor force; one is the agricultural army, which is composed of farmers with rich production experience; and the other is the mobile force, which is composed of two or three hundred young and strong male and female commune members. Wherever there is a difficult task, they go there.

　　Second, the county rushed to repair 219.7 kilometers of highways and spider web-like field roads, and promoted 110,000 soil carts. 170,000 sets of transportation tools were installed with ball bearings, basically realizing ball bearingization. More than 69,000 deep plowing plows were also promoted, and more than 1,100 water-powered universal rotary machines were newly built, saving a lot of labor.

　　Third, the county's 18 communes established seven collaboration zones, each of which is led by a county party committee member stationed there, who regularly convenes collaboration meetings according to the agricultural season and steel production tasks, so that communes can support each other with labor and exchange goods. In this way, everyone's production is well done.

### 大搞群众运动工农业双双跃进  贵州生铁生产超额完成年度计划，秋收进度超过往年  湖南涟源县批判单打一思想，炼铁全省第一，秋种接近完成

    大搞群众运动工农业双双跃进
    贵州生铁生产超额完成年度计划，秋收进度超过往年
    湖南涟源县批判单打一思想，炼铁全省第一，秋种接近完成
    本报贵阳电　记者肖明评述：在大抓钢铁的同时，能不能大抓农业？在钢铁生产跃进得快的地区，秋收进度能不能同样的快？贵州省9月份取得的经验证明完全可能。
    9月下旬，投入高炉生产的劳力，从9月上旬的六十万骤增至三百万，占农村劳动力的三分之一还多，但秋收进度却比去年同期更快。
    如何解决工农业生产同时并进中的困难？根据目前贵州省工作进展情况来看，首要的一条，是领导要有决心，要相信群众有克服一切困难的力量，充分发动群众，使每个群众都了解当前形势，了解全国、全省、全县、全社以及自己的任务。现在从不少地区可以看出这样一条规律，就是钢铁生产跃进得快的地区，秋收进度也快。遵义专区生铁生产在全省领先，产量占全省的三分之二，秋收进度也是全省最快的，原因就是他们充分发动了群众。层层领导干部亲自挂帅，分工负责，直接领导钢铁生产和农业生产，也对工农业生产同时跃进起了保证作用。
    其次，是从上到下，要既有分工，又有协作。而且这种协作是在人民公社化以后，实现了劳动组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化的三化基础上的协作，是在共产主义精神、建设工业化祖国热情的鼓舞下的协作。实现了三化以后，使劳动效率大大提高。过去收稻，每人一天不到五分地，现在平均都在一亩以上。绥阳县一夜之间就收割了全县水稻播种面积的10％以上；天柱县六昼夜就抢收完全部稻谷。实现了三化，使劳动力调动十分灵活应时。白天组成收割大军，晚间又去挖煤运料。大晴天是抢抓收割的黄金时光，高炉工人也组成收割队支援农业。城乡之间、高山与平坝、早熟与晚熟地区也进行协作，工、农、兵、学、商，只要能抽出的人力都去抢收，都去运输。
    充分发动妇女群众，也是达到双跃进的关键之一。贵州全省三百多万各族妇女，几乎是百分之百地参加了劳动。从今春以来，妇女已逐渐形成为农业生产中的主力。她们占农业战线上劳动力的70％—80％，每个妇女担负的土地面积达九亩左右。在最近搞大协作，给土高炉备运粮草中，妇女劳力占50％左右。而且目前已有五万人转战高炉，有二千多妇女炉投入生产。
    目前，全省的农业和钢铁生产双方都处于最紧张阶段。生铁生产在超额完成全年生产计划以后，正在组织第二个战役。农业生产除继续抢收以外，秋耕秋种要大力突击进行，深翻八寸到一尺，人力畜力的需要都多了。因此，“大干钢铁，不松农业”仍然是全省全党全民的行动口号，9月份的良好成绩和经验，就是10月份继续前进的基础。
    据新华社长沙7日电　湖南省炼铁基地之一的涟源县大破“双手只能捉一条鱼”论，使全县炼铁和粮食生产比翼高飞。9月29日，全县生铁日产量达二千五百一十三吨，居全省第一位。现在，全县每天有二十五万多农民战斗在铁山和钢铁运输线上，另有十六万多农民战斗在田野。二十五万亩的秋种任务目前已完成90％。积肥工作去年这时尚未动手，现在平均每亩已经积肥二百多担。较大的水库工程也有二十多处提前开工了。
    涟源县开始大搞炼铁的时候，正碰上收割中稻的大忙季节，差五、六万个劳动力。怎么办？当时有三种主张：一种人认为反正“双手捉不了两条鱼”，要大搞钢铁，就只好放松农业；另一种人认为吃饭第一，粮食生产第一，要抓钢铁，只要抓几个大厂矿就够了；大多数人却认为右手抓钢铁，左手抓粮食，工农业并举，并不矛盾，劳力不足，大家出主意，搞技术大革命来解决。于是，一场全民性的大辩论在全县展开了。辩论的焦点是：要不要大搞钢铁生产支援国家工业化？抓钢铁会不会影响农业大跃进？两者劳力矛盾如何解决？辩论在9月中旬召开的全县扩大干部会上达到了高潮。参加会议的县、乡、社干部三千多人，张贴了一万四千多张大字报，进行了五天的鸣放辩论，并且到红旗公社参观。红旗公社抽出70％的劳力炼铁，半月内投入生产的炉子由二十六座增加到六十八座，生铁日产量由原来的三点二吨一跃而达到二十吨。由于劳动力安排组织得好，全社农业生产也没有耽误。农业战线上的社员三天三晚修好五百九十八里田间运输道，新添土车四百六十多部，基本实现车子化，一万多亩中稻比原计划提前三天收完，还抢种了一千多亩秋杂粮作物。积肥、深耕、修水利等工作都做得很出色。通过大辩论和现场参观，到会干部认识到工农业的相互关系，认识到“事在人为”，只要发动群众想办法，没有克服不了的困难。人人心情舒畅，个个干劲冲天，回去发动群众突击三昼夜，就把剩余的中稻抢收完。全县二十七万多亩中稻前后共二十天就收割完。
    涟源县做到钢铁、粮食生产两不误的主要经验是：
    首先，全县劳力在县委统一领导下组成战斗整体，全面规划，统一安排。全县十八个人民公社，每社都有三支劳动大军：一支是约占全社劳动力70％左右的钢铁大军；一支是由富有生产经验的农民组成的农业大军；还有一支是由两三百名青壮年男女社员组成的机动力量，那里有艰巨的突击任务，他们就到那里。
    其次，全县抢修了二百一十九点七公里的公路和蜘蛛网似的田间大道，推广了十一万部土车。有十七万套运输工具安装了滚珠轴承，基本上实现了滚珠轴承化。还推广了六万九千多部深耕犁，新建一千一百多部水力带动的万能转盘机，节省了大量劳动力。
    再次，全县十八个公社成立七个协作区，每个协作区由一位长驻在那里的县委委员领导，经常按农事季节、钢铁生产任务召开协作会议，社与社间互相支援劳力，互通有无。这样大家的生产都搞好了。
