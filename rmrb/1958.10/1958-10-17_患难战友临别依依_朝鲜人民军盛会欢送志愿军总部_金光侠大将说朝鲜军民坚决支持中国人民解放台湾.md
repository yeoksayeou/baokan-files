Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: A Korean People's Army delegation headed by General Kim Kwang-hyup, Minister of National Defense of the Korean Cabinet, held a grand farewell meeting at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army this afternoon to warmly bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army headquarters who are about to return home.

The delegation arrived at the Volunteer Army headquarters this morning. Members included senior generals and officers such as General Li Kwon-mu, Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army, and Lieutenant General Seo Cheol, Director of the General Political Bureau, totaling thirty-five people.

Qiao Xiaoguang, China's ambassador to North Korea, who had rushed from Pyongyang to the Volunteer Army headquarters to welcome the delegation, also attended today's meeting.

The farewell meeting began with the national anthems of China and North Korea. General Kim Kwang-hyup delivered a farewell speech. First, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said that in the struggle against the common enemy of China and North Korea—the American aggressors—you used your blood to defend every inch of our country's land and sincerely helped the Korean people's post-war recovery and construction work. The great and immortal feats of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, like beautiful legends, will be passed down to our future generations and last forever along with the prosperous history of our motherland. General Kim Kwang-hyup said: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army's initiative to withdraw from Korea once again demonstrated your sincere efforts to seek peaceful reunification of Korea and peace in the Far East and the world. However, the American aggressors refuse to withdraw from our country but intensify new tensions in the southern half of our country and the Far East. Disregarding repeated warnings from the Chinese government, US imperialism continues to strengthen its military forces in the Taiwan Strait region, illegally infringing on China's territorial waters and airspace. This blatant provocative act is not only a crude interference in China's internal affairs but also a challenge to the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army severely condemn the towering crimes of US imperialism in invading China with extreme anger, and we are vigilantly watching the enemy's actions. We fully support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and are confident that they will be victorious. In the struggle to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, we will always advance together with the Chinese people.

General Kim Kwang-hyup concluded his speech amidst warm applause. Then, on behalf of the Korean People's Army, he presented banners and gifts to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. When General Kim Kwang-hyup handed two Korean-made submachine guns to General Yang Yong, Commander of the Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, Political Commissar, the entire audience cheered in unison: "Thank you to the Korean people and the People's Army for your deep affection. We will always be together!"

General Yang Yong then delivered a reply. First, on behalf of all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters, he sincerely thanked the People's Army delegation for their heartfelt farewell and extended brotherly greetings and high respect to all comrades-in-arms of the Korean People's Army through the delegation. He said that the victory of the Korean people's struggle against American aggression not only defended the freedom and independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea but also guaranteed the security of our country and provided significant support for our people's peaceful construction. General Yang Yong said that from the day we entered Korea, we fought side by side with our close comrades-in-arms, the People's Army. During the three years of arduous war, the two fraternal armies shed blood together. In peaceful days, we guarded the forefront of peace in the East side by side and carried out glorious labor for the post-war economic recovery and socialist construction of the Korean people. As we are about to part, we cannot help but feel infinite attachment to our close comrades-in-arms.

General Yang Yong said that the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will soon withdraw from Korea. The solemn act of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea as scheduled once again proves the desire of the Chinese and Korean people for peace and once again demonstrates our strength and confidence in defending peace.

General Yang Yong finally said that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army cannot tolerate the American aggressors' occupation of our territory of Taiwan, crude interference in our internal affairs, launching war provocations and military threats against our people, and cannot tolerate the so-called "Northward Advance" clamored by the American aggressors and the Lee Seung-man clique. After the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returns home, it will obey the allocation of the motherland. We will always be loyal to our internationalist obligations and always be vigilant against all the clamoring and aggression of US imperialism against peace and the socialist camp.

General Yang Yong presented banners and a list of gifts to the Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. At this moment, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause, and the officers and soldiers raised their arms and shouted: "We fight the enemy side by side, we jointly safeguard peace, and our friendship will last forever!"

After the farewell meeting, the Korean People's Army Comprehensive Art Troupe, which accompanied the delegation, held a farewell performance.

In the evening, the delegation held a grand banquet to welcome the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army Headquarters.

    患难战友临别依依
    朝鲜人民军盛会欢送志愿军总部
    金光侠大将说朝鲜军民坚决支持中国人民解放台湾
    新华社平壤16日电　以朝鲜内阁民族保卫相金光侠大将为首的朝鲜人民军代表团，今天下午在中国人民志愿军总部隆重举行欢送大会，热烈欢送即将归国的志愿军总部官兵。
    代表团是今天上午到达志愿军总部的。团员有人民军总参谋长李权武上将、总政治局局长徐哲中将等高级将领和军官三十五人。
    由平壤赶来志愿军总部欢迎代表团的我国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光也出席了今天的大会。
    欢送大会在中朝两国国歌声中开始。金光侠大将致欢送词。他首先代表朝鲜人民军全体官兵向中国人民志愿军官兵表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。他说，在反对中朝两国的共同敌人——美国侵略者的斗争中，你们以鲜血保卫了我们祖国的每一寸土地，并且诚心诚意地帮助了朝鲜人民的战后恢复和建设工作。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜所发挥的永恒不灭的伟大功勋，像美丽的传说一样，将传到我们的子孙万代，与我们祖国繁荣的历史一同万古流芳。金光侠大将说：中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，再一次显示了你们对谋求朝鲜和平统一与远东和世界和平的真诚努力。但是，美国侵略者拒不撤出我国，却在我们祖国的南半部及远东加剧新的紧张局势。美帝国主义不顾中国政府的一再警告，不断加强在台湾海峡地区的军事力量，非法侵犯中国的领海和领空。这种露骨的挑衅行为，不仅是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，而且是对中国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的挑战。我国人民和人民军官兵以极度的愤怒严厉斥责美帝国主义侵略中国的滔天罪行，并警惕地注视着敌人的蠢动，我们全力支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，并确信他们必会胜利。在维护亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，我们始终与中国人民一道前进。
    金光侠大将在热烈的掌声中结束了讲话。接着，他代表朝鲜人民军向中国人民志愿军赠送了锦旗和礼品。当金光侠大将把朝鲜国产的两支冲锋枪交到志愿军司令员杨勇上将和政治委员王平上将手里时，全场一致欢呼：“感谢朝鲜人民和人民军对我们的深情厚意，我们永远在一起！”
    杨勇上将接着致答谢词。他首先代表中国人民志愿军总部全体同志，衷心感谢人民军代表团的深情送别，并通过代表团向朝鲜人民军全体战友致以兄弟般的问候和崇高的敬意。他说，朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略斗争的胜利，不仅捍卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的自由与独立，同时也保障了我国的安全，对我国人民的和平建设事业给予了重大支援。杨勇上将说，从我们入朝的那一天起，就和亲密的战友人民军并肩作战。在三年艰苦战争岁月中，两支兄弟部队血流在一起。在和平的日子里，我们并肩守卫着东方和平前哨，为朝鲜人民的战后经济恢复和社会主义建设进行了光荣的劳动。在此即将离别之际，我们对亲密的战友不能不感到无限的依恋。
    杨勇上将说，中国人民志愿军总部很快就要撤离朝鲜了。中国人民志愿军如期全部撤出朝鲜这一庄严行动，再一次证明中朝人民对和平的愿望，再一次表现了我们捍卫和平的力量和信心。
    杨勇上将最后说，中国人民志愿军不能容忍美国侵略者侵占我国领土台湾，粗暴地干涉我国内政，向我国人民进行战争挑衅和军事威胁，不能容忍美国侵略者和李承晚集团叫嚣的所谓“北进”。中国人民志愿军回国以后，将听从祖国的分配。我们将永远忠于我们所肩负的国际主义义务，时刻警惕着美帝国主义对和平对社会主义阵营的一切叫嚣和侵略。
    杨勇上将代表中国人民志愿军全体官兵向朝鲜人民军战友们赠送了锦旗和礼品单。这时，全扬掌声雷动，官兵们振臂高呼：“我们并肩杀敌，我们共保和平，我们的友谊将万古长青！”
    欢送大会结束后，随同代表团前来的朝鲜人民军综合艺术团举行了送别演出。
    晚上，代表团举行了盛大宴会，欢宴志愿军总部官兵。
