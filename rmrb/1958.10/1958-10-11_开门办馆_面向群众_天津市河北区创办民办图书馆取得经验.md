Opening Libraries Openly, Serving the Masses
Hebei District, Tianjin Achieves Experience in Establishing Private Libraries

(Reported by this newspaper) Tianjin's districts all have private libraries, but Hebei District started earliest, grew fastest, has the most, and does the best. This is an industrial district with a current population of over 396,000. To further meet the reading needs of the masses, the district's Party committee and government cultural administration departments, on the basis of rectification, liberated their thinking, broke with conventions, boldly mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and vigorously established private libraries. Currently, every street in this district has universally established private libraries.

How are the books for private libraries obtained? After holding meetings and consulting with the masses, the following methods were found: (1) Mobilize organs, schools, factories, and residents to donate books. Because the publicity work was carried out in a relatively thorough and detailed manner, the effect of donating books was very good. Chen Xinying's "Kangtou Library" (炕头图书馆 - literally "bed-head library", meaning a small, informal library) received 400 books donated at once. Their slogans in donating books were: "I for everyone, everyone for me," and "Donate one book, read a hundred books;" (2) The municipal and district libraries and cultural centers provide some books as support; (3) Residents voluntarily donate money to buy some books. Now, the libraries have generally from one thousand to three thousand books. In the future, the solution for replenishing new books for private libraries is: each person who reads books will be issued a library card, and those who receive a library card will pay five cents per month. In this way, each private library will have more than ten yuan per month to purchase new books. At the same time, the new books from the municipal and district libraries will circulate to the private libraries, with books being exchanged regularly. The municipal and district libraries regard private libraries as their strongholds for book circulation to the general public. Now, the Hebei District Library has specifically opened an exchange point for all private libraries, selecting many books suitable for street residents to read, and letting the people from the private libraries choose for themselves.

How is the problem of library premises for private libraries solved? Here, the libraries are all set up in residents' homes, managed by the family members of the home where the library is located. The advantage of doing this is that when someone comes to borrow books, they do the lending work, and when no one comes to borrow books, they can take care of household chores. They call this "books and housework, both without delay." In addition, some middle and primary school students in the district also participate in the management of private libraries.

The method of managing books in each private library is very convenient for readers. Books are generally divided into four major categories: political, literary, scientific, and other, for registration, and the open-shelf system is adopted to allow readers to choose books themselves. After the books are selected, readers only need to fill in a registration number on the library card, leave the library card in the library, and take the book away. The book circulation work mainly involves personal borrowing, with two types of borrowing: one is that readers borrow themselves, and the other is that books are delivered to readers' homes. At the same time, some readers are consciously and purposefully guided to carry out policy propaganda and education work through books. For example, if it is found that a woman's housekeeping is not thrifty enough, the managers of the private library will send some books on thrift and housekeeping to her home and ask her to read them; if a family's sanitation work is not done well, some books on how to improve family sanitation will be delivered to their door; because the libraries are run openly, the book circulation rate reaches over 80%. In order to improve work, Chen Xinying's Kangtou Library plans to further integrate with the work of literacy and newspaper reading groups in the future, so that private libraries can become powerful tools for the masses to learn culture and publicize current affairs and policies.

In order to help these private libraries improve their work, summarize and exchange experiences, the Tianjin Municipal People's Library and the Hebei District Library plan to strengthen their guidance through holding training classes, symposiums, publishing publications, and individual in-depth approaches.

A fundamental reason why private libraries in Hebei District have been able to develop and consolidate rapidly is the attention and leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels. In the work of developing private libraries, the District Party Committee has issued instructions and arrangements to various grassroots Party organizations, and the District People's Committee has also issued notices on the book donation campaign to factories, enterprises, organs, and schools under its jurisdiction. The District Head and the Head of the District Culture Section personally took charge, arranging, guiding, and inspecting the work. The Party and government organizations of each street have included the work of private libraries in their current work agenda. Bai Hua, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and several Deputy Directors of the Municipal Bureau of Culture are also very concerned about the work of private libraries.

    开门办馆　面向群众
    天津市河北区创办民办图书馆取得经验
    本报讯　天津市各区都有民办图书馆，办得最早、最快、最多、最好的是河北区。这里是一个工业区，现有人口三十九万六千多人。为了进一步满足群众看书的要求，该区的党委和政府文化行政部门，在整风的基础上，解放了思想，打破了常规，大胆发动群众，依靠群众，大力兴办起民办图书馆来了。目前，这个区各个街道都已经普遍建立了民办图书馆。
    民办图书馆的图书是如何解决的呢？经过召开会议与群众商量，找出以下几个办法：（一）发动机关、学校、工厂和居民捐献图书。由于宣传工作做得比较深入、细致，捐献图书的效果很好。陈新英的炕头图书馆一下就捐到图书四百册，他们在捐书中的口号是：“我为人人，人人为我”，“献书一册，看书百册”；（二）由市、区图书馆、文化馆支援一部分图书；（三）居民自愿捐钱买一部分图书。现在各个民办图书馆的图书一般都有一千多册到三千册左右。今后民办图书馆补充新书的解决办法是：看书的人每人发一个借书证，领借书证的人每月交五分钱。这样，每个民办图书馆每月有十几块钱添购新书。同时，市、区图书馆的新书流通到民办图书馆去，定期换书。市、区图书馆把民办图书馆作为自己向广大居民进行图书流通的据点。现在，河北区图书馆已专门为各民办图书馆开辟了一个换书处，挑选了很多适合街道居民阅读的书籍，让各民办图书馆的人自己来挑选。
    民办图书馆的馆舍问题如何解决？这里的图书馆都是设在居民的家里，由图书馆所在的家里人管理。这样做的好处是有人来借书时就搞借书工作，没有人来借书时就可以料理家务，他们把这叫做图书、家务两不误。另外，还有一些本区的中、小学生也参加了民办图书馆的管理工作。
    各民办图书馆管理图书的方法对读者非常方便。图书一般是分政治、文艺、科技和其它四大项进行登记，并采用开架式让读者自己挑选图书，图书选好之后，只要在借书证上填写一个登记号码，把借书证留在图书馆里就可以拿走。图书流通工作主要是搞个人外借，外借的方式分两种：一种是读者自己来借，一种是把图书送到读者家里。同时还对一些读者有意识有目的地通过图书去进行政策宣传和教育工作，如发现哪一家妇女持家不够勤俭，民办图书馆的管理人员就把一些关于勤俭持家的书送到她的家里去，请她看；哪一家的卫生工作搞得不好，就把一些关于如何搞好家庭卫生的书送上门去；由于开门办馆，图书流通率达到80％以上。为了改进工作，陈新英炕头图书馆今后还准备与扫盲和读报组的工作进一步结合起来，使民办图书馆成为群众学习文化和宣传时事政策的有力工具。
    天津市人民图书馆和河北区图书馆为了帮助这些民办图书馆改进工作，总结和交流经验，准备通过举办训练班、座谈会、出版刊物和个别深入等方式来加强对它们的辅导。
    河北区民办图书馆能够得到迅速的发展和巩固的一个基本原因，是各级党委和政府的重视和领导。在发展民办图书馆的工作中，区委曾向各基层党的组织作了指示和布置，区人民委员会也向所属工厂、企业、机关和学校等单位发了献书运动的通知，区长和区文化科长亲自挂帅，布置、指导和检查工作。各街道的党、政组织都把民办图书馆的工作列为他们当前的工作日程。中共天津市委宣传部白桦副部长和市文化局的几位副局长也十分关心民办图书馆的工作。
