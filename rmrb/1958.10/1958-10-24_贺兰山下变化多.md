Great Changes Under the Helan Mountains

    **Shi Zuishan Coal Mine Leaps Forward**

    The Shi Zuishan Coal Mine, China's largest coal industrial base in the Northwest, is being constructed at an accelerated pace. The first pair of inclined shafts, with a daily output of 500 to 600 tons, which went into production on "August 1st" (Army Day), successfully experimented with hydraulic mining before National Day and are now officially using it. The No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 inclined shafts, originally scheduled to begin construction in June, August, and October of this year, respectively, were started ahead of schedule in April and June. The No. 1 large vertical shaft, with an annual output of more than 1.5 million tons, also began construction in September, more than half a year ahead of schedule. Now, the mining area is a scene of busy construction everywhere. At night, the lights are brilliant, and the roar of winches and air compressors shakes the Helan Mountain valley.

    The Shi Zuishan mining area has a coal reserve of 560 million tons, with up to nine coal seams, the thickest of which is 14 meters. After the mining area is completed, it will become one of China's larger coal industrial bases. At present, there are more than 5,500 workers participating in the construction. Three years ago, it was a desolate and uninhabited wasteland, but now rows of workers' residences, bathhouses, coal mine machinery repair plants, industrial universities, and employee children's schools have appeared. The railway dedicated line leading to the mining area is also being laid at a rapid pace.

    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, after all four pairs of inclined shafts and four pairs of vertical shafts of this coal mine are completed, the annual coal output will reach 8 million tons. At that time, a large amount of coal will not only meet the construction needs of the Ningxia region, but will also continuously support Gansu, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions.

    **Building a Modern Flax Mill**

    In the suburbs of Guyuan County in southern Ningxia, a flax mill equipped with 5,000 spindles and 500 looms has recently started construction. This flax mill is fully equipped with modern equipment and covers an area of 120,000 square meters. The entire project will be completed by the end of 1959. After completion, it will have more than 1,600 employees and can produce 11.81 million meters of plain linen, coarse linen, and canvas annually, with a total output value of 24 million yuan.

    The Guyuan area in southern Ningxia is rich in oil crops such as flax (linseed), and can produce 160 million jin of flax every year. However, in the past, because there were no flax textile factories, the flax was not well utilized, and most of it was burned as firewood. The construction of such a large flax mill will play a great role in improving the production and living standards of the Hui and Han people.

    **Yinchuan Woolen Mill is Expanding**

    The eighteen new products recently trial-produced by the Yinchuan Woolen Textile Factory have been unanimously praised by customers at home and abroad. In particular, the famous various jacquard blankets and blended plaid blankets are selling well in the Soviet Union, India, and Arab countries. So far, this factory has trial-produced more than 40 kinds of new products, some of which have reached international standards.

    In order to adapt to the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and meet the growing needs of consumers, this factory is undergoing large-scale expansion. After completion by the end of next year, all workshops in the factory will be fully mechanized, and the production volume will be twelve times higher than the current level.

    **Surpassing the Ming Tombs Reservoir**

    In the arid mountainous area of Tongxin County, more than 7,000 Hui and Han people are building the largest water storage project in the entire autonomous region—the Zhangjiawan Reservoir. After the reservoir is completed by June next year, it will turn nearly 400,000 mu of dry land in the Majiawan area into paddy fields, and the increased grain production each year can feed 400,000 people for a year.

    This reservoir is divided into two major parts: the main dam and the canal project. The main dam includes five parts: the dam body, water intake tower, water diversion tunnel, spillway, and work bridge. The dam is 32.4 meters high, 7 meters wide at the top, and 2,150 meters long, with a storage capacity of 146 million cubic meters, which is larger than the Ming Tombs Reservoir. In addition, a power station with a capacity of 600 kilowatts will be built next to the water intake tower to supply the needs of Tongxin County and surrounding agencies, industries, and residents.

    **Sandbreak Forest Belts on the Great Desert**

    Winding along the edge of the Tengger Desert in the northern part of Zhongwei County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a sandbreak forest belt as long as 150 li has been created. This sandbreak forest belt, like a green Great Wall, surrounds the Tengger Desert. With the rapid growth of the sandbreak forest, sand dunes in many places no longer move; farmland that was buried by sand in the past has once again become fertile land; state-owned farms have been built on the edge of the desert that used to be uninhabited; in Tengjia Tan, where it used to be said that "no girl will marry to Tengjia Tan, if you marry there your tears will never dry," more than 50 households have built happy homes here.

    **High-Yield Nursery Satellite**

    The Yinchuan City Afforestation Station achieved an average yield of 80,000 seedlings per mu this year using seed propagation of ten mu and two fen of Populus simonii. Among them, eight fen and three li of high-yield fields produced 164,892 seedlings, breaking the national record of 120,000 seedlings per mu. Now the seedlings are 158 cm high and the root collar diameter is 0.3 cm. (with picture)

The County Party Committee immediately organized more than 200 people to carry out mining, advance toward nature, and demand copper from the barren mountains.

    贺兰山下变化多
    石咀山煤矿飞跃前进
    我国西北最大的煤炭工业基地石咀山煤矿，正在加速建设。今年“八一”投入生产的日产五百吨到六百吨的第一对斜井，在国庆节前试验水力采煤成功后，现在已正式使用水力采煤。原计划今年6、8、10三个月开工兴建的二、三、四号斜井，已分别在4月和6月提前开工。年产一百五十多万吨的一号大型竖井，也比原计划提前半年多，在9月份开工兴建。现在，矿区到处是一片繁忙的建设景象。夜晚，灯火辉煌，绞车和压风机的轰鸣声，震动着贺兰山谷。
    石咀山矿区煤的蕴藏量达五亿六千万吨，煤层多至九层，最厚的达十四公尺。矿区建成后，将成为我国较大的煤炭工业基地之一。目前，参加建设的职工已有五千五百多人。三年前还是一片荒无人烟的荒滩上，现在已出现一幢幢的工人住宅、浴室，煤矿机器修配厂、工业大学和职工子弟学校等建筑物。通往矿区的铁路专用线也正在紧张铺轨。
    第二个五年计划期间，这个煤矿的四对斜井、四对竖井全部建成后，年产煤将达八百万吨。那时，大量的煤炭不仅能满足宁夏地区的建设需要，还将源源不断地支援甘肃、内蒙古等省区。
    兴建现代化亚麻厂
    在宁夏南部固原县城郊，一座设备五千纱锭、五百台织机的亚麻厂，在最近动工兴建。这座亚麻厂，完全采用现代化的设备，占地面积十二万平方公尺。全部工程将在1959年年底建成，建成以后，将有职工一千六百多人，每年可以生产原色细布、粗亚麻布、帆布共一千一百八十一万公尺，总产值达二千四百万元。
    宁夏南部的固原专区，盛产葫麻（亚麻）等油料作物，每年可产亚麻一亿六千万市斤。但过去因为没有亚麻纺织工厂，亚麻都没有很好利用，绝大部分被当柴烧了。现在兴建这样大的亚麻厂，对提高回汉族人民的生产和生活水平，都将起很大作用。
    银川毛纺厂在扩建
    银川毛纺织厂，最近试制成的十八种新产品，受到了国内外顾客的一致称赞。特别是著名的各色提花毯和混纺格毯，已经在苏联、印度和阿拉伯各国畅销。到目前为止，这个厂已经试制成的各种新产品，达四十余种。其中有的已达到了国际水平。
    为了适应宁夏回族自治区的成立，和满足广大消费者日益增长的需要，这个厂正在大规模地进行扩建。到明年年底建成以后，全厂各个车间即可全部实现机械化，生产量将比现有水平提高十二倍。
    赛过十三陵水库
    在干旱的同心县山区，七千多名回汉族人民正在修建一座全自治区最大的蓄水工程——张家湾水库。这座水库到明年6月建成后，能使马家湾一带近四十万亩旱地变成水田，每年增产的粮食，可供四十万人吃一年。
    这座水库，分主坝和渠道工程两大部分。主坝包括坝体、取水塔、输水洞、溢洪道和工作桥等五部分。坝高三十二点四公尺，顶宽七公尺，长达二千一百五十公尺，蓄水量为一亿四千六百万公方，比十三陵水库还大。另外，在取水塔机旁，还将建立一个容量六百瓩的发电站，供同心县城和周围机关、工业和居民需用。
    大沙漠上的防沙林带
    蜿蜒在宁夏回族自治区中卫县北部沿腾格里大沙漠边缘，已经营造起一条长达一百五十华里的防沙林带。这一防沙林带，宛似一条绿色的长城，把腾格里沙漠包围起来。随着防沙林的迅速成长，很多地方沙丘不再游动了；过去被风沙埋没的农田，又重新变成良田；从前荒无人烟的沙漠边上，已建起了国营农场；过去流传的“有女不嫁腾家滩，嫁到滩上泪不干”的腾家滩，已有五十多户人家在这里建起了幸福的家园。
    苗圃高产卫星
    银川市造林站，今年用种子繁殖的十亩二分小叶杨，平均亩产量达八万株。其中八分三厘丰产田，产苗十六万四千八百九十二株，突破了全国亩产十二万株的最高纪录。现在苗高一百五十八公分，根际直径为零点三公分。（附图片）
