Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Telegram: The people of Anguo County, Hebei Province, have overcome the worst drought in thirty years. This year, the per-mu yield of grain crops (including wheat) can reach 3,200 jin, an increase of more than 5.8 times compared to last year. The per-mu yield of cotton can reach 200 jin (seed cotton, same below), an increase of three times compared to last year. The per-mu yield of peanuts can reach 548 jin, an increase of 2.6 times compared to last year. Now, farmers throughout the county are working day and night to harvest the unprecedentedly abundant crops.

The great leap forward in agricultural production in Anguo County is a victory for the people of the county in conscientiously implementing the General Line. Before the spring sowing, the Anguo County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the battle cry of "Unwilling to cross the Yellow River, guarantee to cross the Yangtze River, determined to achieve ten thousand (jin) of sweet potatoes, one hundred (jin) of cotton, and one thousand jin of grain," and led the commune members to launch movements such as deep plowing of land, water conservancy construction, promotion of improved varieties, increased application of fertilizer, drought-resistant sowing, and pest and weed control. The enthusiasm of the broad masses for increasing production rose wave upon wave, with each wave surpassing the previous one, increasing step by step. When deep plowing the land, 150,000 commune members throughout the county worked tirelessly in wind and snow, eating and sleeping in the fields, fighting the cold in the morning, deep plowing in the afternoon, and working in shifts at night. After three intensive campaigns, 390,000 mu of spring land throughout the county were deep plowed to a depth of one foot and two inches or more. In the water conservancy construction movement, the commune members overcame difficulties such as cold weather, lack of funds, and lack of technology, built more than 1,300 machine wells, more than 20 socialist large wells, and installed 900 machines, overcoming the severe drought of 200 consecutive days without rain.

In all aspects of production, the county adopted the method of great airing of views, great contending, and great debates to continuously and deeply publicize the Party's General Line for socialist construction, so that the spirit of the General Line generated tremendous power among the people. In the spring, when formulating the leap forward plan, some township and commune cadres and commune members lacked confidence, which resulted in the plan not being implemented. At this time, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels, a mass debate was launched. By presenting facts, reasoning, and making detailed calculations, various right-leaning conservative ideas were powerfully criticized. When sowing autumn crops, the drought became increasingly serious, and wheat growth was also slow. Some people wavered again about realizing the leap forward plan. The county then launched a major debate on combating drought and ensuring a bumper harvest. More than 160,000 commune members fought for ten days, universally irrigating and topdressing 180,000 mu of wheat, and also sowing autumn crops on time. Such airing of views and debates have been carried out 14 times to date, enabling the enthusiasm of the masses to increase step by step, ensuring the great leap forward in agricultural production.

    粮食亩产三千斤　皮棉亩产二百斤
    安国县一年跃过长江
    新华社天津电　河北省安国县人民战胜三十年来没有过的大旱，今年粮食作物（包括小麦在内）亩产可达三千二百斤，比去年增产五点八倍多。棉花亩产可达二百斤（皮棉、下同），比去年增产三倍。花生亩产可达五百四十八斤，比去年增产二点六倍。现在全县农民正昼夜不停地收割空前丰登的庄稼。
    安国县农业生产的大跃进，是全县人民认真贯彻执行总路线的胜利。春播前，中共安国县委提出“不甘过黄河，保证过长江，决心实现万（斤）薯、百（斤）棉、千斤粮”的战斗口号，并领导社员群众展开了深翻土地、水利建设、推广良种、增施肥料、抗旱播种、除虫锄草等运动。广大群众的增产热情一波推一波，后浪赶前浪，步步增高。深翻土地的时候，全县十五万社员风雪不停，在地头食宿，上午打冻，下午深翻，晚上轮班鏖战，经过三次突击，将全县三十九万亩春白地深翻一尺二寸以上。在兴修水利运动中，社员们克服了天寒地冻、资金不足、技术缺乏等困难，建成机井一千三百多眼，社会主义大井二十多个，安装机器九百台，战胜了连续二百天没雨的大旱。
    在各个生产环节中，全县采取大鸣大放大辩论的方法，持续深入地宣传了党的社会主义建设总路线，使总路线的精神在人民群众中产生了巨大的力量。春季，在制定跃进计划时，有些乡、社干部和社员信心不足，以致计划不能落实。这时，在各级党组织的领导下展开了全民大辩论。经过摆事实、讲道理、算细账，有力地批判了各色各样的右倾保守思想。大秋作物播种时，旱象日益严重，小麦生长也慢，有些人又对实现跃进计划表现动摇。全县又展开了抗旱保丰收的大辩论，十六万多社员鏖战十天，把十八万亩小麦普遍浇水、追肥一次，大秋作物也按时播了种。这样的鸣放辩论，至目前共已进行了十四次，使群众干劲步步提高，保证了农业生产的大跃进。
