The autumn harvest is celebrated with songs and dances, and the enthusiasm for production is rising in Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Zhejiang provinces amidst congratulations. Let's see who the heroes will be tomorrow.

(By our correspondent from Xi'an, October 3rd) In the past few days, from the Guanzhong Plain to the Hanzhong Basin, the Weibei Plateau, and the areas along the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi, more than 13 million farmers in Shaanxi Province have gathered to celebrate the bumper agricultural harvest. In the Guanzhong area, more than 7 million farmers have integrated harvest celebrations with autumn harvesting and sowing activities, moving the celebrations to the fields. Farmers in Weinan, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, and other counties held field parade celebrations during the autumn harvest, carrying their harvested fruits, parading, and congratulating each other. The Hongqi People's Commune in Shuangwang Township, Weinan County, held a celebration at the site of a corn "satellite" field cultivated by the commune members. This satellite field yielded 9,575 catties per mu, 14 times higher than the local average yield. The cultivators of the satellite field shared their high-yield experiences, boosting everyone's confidence in striving for even greater harvests next year.

Zhezhui County, which had experienced continuous production declines for years, saw its total grain output nearly double this year compared to last year. To strive for even greater harvests, farmers across the county are now rushing to deep-plow the land. In the evenings, more than 90 production teams from the county's eight people's communes held joint celebration parties. Many commune members, still smelling of the field's soil, came to the venues. Local amateur artists played gongs and drums and plucked strings, and everyone sang folk songs and local tunes, creating a unique atmosphere.

Before National Day, the people's communes in the suburbs of Xi'an also slaughtered pigs and sheep to organize farmer feasts. At night, the communes' clubs organized activities, with more than 60 amateur theater troupes staging their own new programs, and more than 380 choirs and 70 dance teams singing and dancing in villages and outside.

The 17 people's communes in Nanzheng County in the Hanzhong Basin in southern Shaanxi also held celebrations in different areas. Farmers across the county expressed their determination to celebrate the harvest with practical actions. Recently, the fields in Nanzheng County have been filled with people during the day and lights at night. Farmers aim to deep-plow all 330,000 mu of land in the county by October 10th to strive for an even greater harvest next year.

(By our correspondent from Shenyang, October 3rd) The countryside of Liaoning Province is immersed in the carnival of celebrating National Day and a bumper harvest. On the morning of October 1st, celebration rallies were generally held in rural areas throughout the province. In the evening, report meetings and symposiums were organized, and cultural and recreational activities were widely launched. In Heishan County, 300,000 farmers held a lantern parade. Many places partied until late at night.

This year, the province's agricultural production has reached an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output of the Liaoyang Special Zone is expected to reach 3.85 million tons this year, an increase of nearly 100% compared to last year. The Taiyangsheng People's Commune in Fuxian County used large trucks to carry large corns (each more than a foot long), large apples (each more than a pound), and large mustard greens (each more than two pounds) to participate in the parade. The Lanqi People's Commune in the county also selected more than 50 "Golden Star" apples (each weighing more than a pound and a half) to be handed over to the conference for presentation to Chairman Mao. The Hongqi People's Commune in Yingkou County presented a giant sweet potato weighing more than four catties, a cotton plant bearing more than 300 peaches, sorghum weighing more than one catty, and a large cabbage weighing more than 30 catties to the celebration rally as gifts. Tai'an County also held a deep-plowing oath-taking rally, guaranteeing the completion of deep-plowing 50,000 hectares of land within a month.

This year, farmers in Liaoning Province have not only produced a large amount of grain for the motherland but also a large amount of steel. On this day, they also reported to the motherland the great achievements they have made on the steel front. So far, more than 14,000 small and earthen blast furnaces have been built throughout the province, and more than 3,500 have been put into production, producing more than 7,000 tons of pig iron. The steel teams of Tieling, Faku, Xifeng, and other counties are determined to produce more steel and overfulfill their production tasks.

During the celebration of National Day in the province's rural areas, a general military parade of the militia was held. All militiamen expressed their extreme anger at the imperialists' criminal war provocation of disregarding China's repeated serious warnings and directing the Chiang gang's air force to use "Sidewinder" missiles to attack our air force. They expressed their determination to strengthen their military studies and stand ready at all times to answer the motherland's call and eliminate the invaders.

(By our correspondent from Hangzhou, October 3rd) This year's National Day is especially lively and joyful in the vast countryside of Zhejiang Province. It turns out that all localities are celebrating "Triple Happiness," celebrating National Day while also celebrating the bumper grain harvest, the establishment of people's communes, and the launching of high-yield satellites in steel production. In the Jinhua Special Zone, more than 2 million people's commune members participated in rallies and other celebration activities. Many villages held demonstrations and parades, with commune members carrying models of small blast furnaces, grains, and crops, participating in the parade despite the rain. Many people's communes held feasts and a variety of cultural and recreational activities. Dragon lanterns, "hundred-children" lanterns, and lion dances were performed everywhere, with gongs and drums filling the air, creating a very lively atmosphere. In many coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, large-scale military parades of the militia were held. Gao Xiangfei, the militia company commander of Liushi Town, Yueqing County, said that the American bandits used missiles to attack our planes in the Wenzhou area, and we are determined to give the US imperialists a punitive blow.

Many regions have launched a production upsurge during the celebration of National Day. After celebrating National Day, the 14 people's communes in Jiaxing County immediately organized more than 200,000 commune members to rush to accumulate soil fertilizer, ensuring that winter crops have 300 dan of fertilizer per mu within five days.
