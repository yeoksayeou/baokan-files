    U.S. Newspaper Admits Soviet Rocket Technology Maintains Advantage
    According to a New China News Agency dispatch, “The New York Times,” in an editorial on the first anniversary of the launch of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite, said: "It would be dangerous for us to ignore the leading role the Soviet Union plays in the race to conquer space, or to ignore the fact that the Soviet Union still maintains its advantage in rockets. None of the satellites we have launched have reached even half the weight of the Soviet Union's first satellite, and since then, the Russians have launched two much heavier rockets into orbit, which proves that the Soviet Union still maintains an advantage in rockets.”
    According to the Associated Press, Dr. Jastrow, a consultant at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, said that it appears that the Soviet Union has established a system for observing artificial earth satellites that is more precise than the U.S. system. Jastrow said that the Russians are able to calculate the orbit of their third satellite to an accuracy of less than eighty meters. This shows that they can pinpoint the satellite's position at any given moment with an error not exceeding eighty meters from the satellite's actual position. He said this degree of observational accuracy is three to five times greater than the system the U.S. is currently using to observe the orbit of the “Vanguard” satellite. Furthermore, the position of the "Vanguard" satellite can be determined more precisely than the position of other U.S. satellites.

    美报承认苏联火箭技术保持优势
    据新华社讯　“纽约时报”就苏联第一颗人造卫星发射一周年发表社论说：“如果我们忽视苏联在征服宇宙的竞赛中领先的主导作用，或者忽视苏联在火箭方面仍然保持着优势，那是很危险的。我们发射的卫星没有一个达到苏联第一个卫星重量的一半，而俄国人却从那时候起又把两个重得多的火箭发射进了轨道，这就证明苏联在火箭方面仍旧保持着优势。
    据美联社报道，美国海军科学研究实验室顾问雅斯特鲁博士说，看来，苏联已建立了一套比美国更为精确的观察人造地球卫星的系统。雅斯特鲁说，俄国人能够把他们第三个卫星的轨道的精确程度计算到八十公尺以下。这表明他们能够指出卫星在任何时刻的位置而使误差不超过卫星实际位置的八十公尺。他说，这种观察的精确度要等于美国现在用以观察“先锋号”卫星轨道系统的三倍到五倍。而且“先锋号”卫星的位置比美国其他卫星的位置还是可以测定得更精确一些的。
