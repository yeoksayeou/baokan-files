Closely Following Steel, Advancing at High Speed
    Where Furnaces are Built, Transportation Extends
    Over 20,000 Government Vehicles Organized
    Half of the Nation's Trucks Implement Trailer Transport
    (By Our Newspaper) The highway transportation front has launched two "satellites" as a gift for National Day. On September 29th, the number of government vehicles participating in transportation reached over 20,000, doubling the 11,000+ vehicles at the end of August; the number of truck trailers also reached 20,000, more than doubling the 9,000+ at the end of August.

    Organizing government vehicles to participate in transportation is one of the important measures to solve the transportation tension. Under the leadership of Vice Mayor Feng Jiping, Beijing has organized all government vehicles. After two days of hard work on the 26th and 27th, they transported all the goods accumulated at more than ten stations. On the 28th, they transported more than 37,000 tons of goods, with an average daily output of 33.5 tons per vehicle, more than doubling the transportation volume per vehicle before the organization. Heilongjiang, Henan, and other provinces have also fully organized government vehicles. Manufacturing a large number of trailers to realize truck trains is the direction of highway transportation development. Under the leadership of the Party committees, many places have mobilized the masses, adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and used local materials such as bamboo and wood to manufacture trailers. Henan Province has manufactured trailers in every county; the employees of Xuchang Transportation Company alone worked hard for four days and nights to manufacture 124 trailers. At present, 50% of the nation's trucks have implemented trailer transportation; Heilongjiang, Hunan, Zhejiang, and other provinces have reached one trailer per truck, and Shandong Province has reached more than one and a half trailers per truck.

    People's Liberation Army units in various places have also dispatched thousands of vehicles to support steel transportation, and various forms of civilian transportation tools have also been utilized extensively. Thus, on highways and rural and mining area roads across the country, trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts fully loaded with ore, coking coal, and steel materials are running day and night, forming a magnificent picture of the whole people engaging in transportation.

    (By Our Newspaper) Wang Yunlong, a driver of the Liuzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office Transportation Bureau in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and a national model worker, drove a ten-wheeled truck towing fifty-two trailers loaded with 187 tons of rubble on September 29th, transporting it seven kilometers from the Daqiao quarry back to Liuzhou. This is an outstanding record in the country.

    紧追钢铁  高速前进
    炉子建在哪里　运输通到哪里
    两万多机关汽车组织起来
    全国半数汽车推行挂车运输
    本报讯　公路运输战线放出了两颗向国庆节献礼的“卫星”。9月29日这一天，各地机关汽车参加运输的已达两万多辆，比8月底的一万一千多辆翻了一番；汽车挂车也达到两万辆，比8月底的九千多辆增加了一倍多。
    组织机关汽车参加运输，是解决交通运输紧张的重要措施之一。北京市在冯基平副市长主持下，已经组织起全部机关车辆，经过26、27两天苦战，就将十多个车站积压的物资运完，28日一天运输了三万七千多吨货，平均每车日产量达三十三吨半，比组织起来以前的每车运输量增加一倍多。黑龙江、河南等省也已经把机关汽车全部组织起来。大量制造挂车，实现汽车列车化，是公路运输的发展方向。许多地方在党委领导下，发动群众，采取土洋结合的办法，就地取材，用竹子、木头等制造挂车。河南省县县制挂车；仅许昌运输公司职工苦战四昼夜，就制造挂车一百二十四辆。现在，全国已有50％的汽车实现了挂车运输；黑龙江、湖南、浙江等省已达一车一挂，山东省已达一车一个半挂车以上。
    各地人民解放军部队也抽出了几千辆汽车支援钢铁运输，各种民间运输工具也被大量利用起来。这样，在全国各地公路线和农村、矿区道路上，就昼夜不停地奔跑着满载矿石、焦煤和钢铁物资的汽车、马车和人力车，构成了一幅全民办运输的壮丽图景。
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区柳州专员公署交通运输局司机、全国劳动模范王云龙，9月29日驾驶一辆十轮卡车拖挂了五十二辆挂车，满载片石，共一百八十七吨，从大桥打石厂运回柳州，运距七公里。这在全国是一项优异的纪录。
