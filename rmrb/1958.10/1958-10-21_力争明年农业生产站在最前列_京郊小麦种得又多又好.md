Strive to Be at the Forefront of Agricultural Production Next Year
Beijing Suburbs Plant More and Better Wheat

(Our dispatch) Beijing suburban farmers have completed the winter wheat sowing plan with high quality and exceeding the target.

This year's wheat sowing in the suburbs, due to adequate preparation and early action, progressed rapidly. The majority of wheat fields were sown in a timely manner during the "Autumn Equinox" and "White Dew" seasons. The wheat fields were deep-plowed to about 1.5 Chinese feet, and most achieved layered fertilization, with fertilization amounts exceeding 50,000 catties. Land leveling basically achieved garden-style management. Sowing was done at 40 catties or more, and mostly with carefully selected improved varieties. Now, the earlier sown wheat fields are a lush green, with the wheat seedlings growing exceptionally densely and strongly, and some seedlings have already begun to tiller.

During the rush to plant winter wheat, extensive mass debates were conducted in the suburbs to liberate thinking and raise awareness. The broad masses of commune members were filled with enthusiasm and determined to strive to make the per-mu yield of wheat in the suburbs rank at the forefront of the country next year. They held rallies to pledge to leap forward in wheat production and sent large numbers of cadres and commune members to visit and learn from advanced experience in increasing production in other areas. As soon as September arrived, deep plowing of wheat fields and sowing work rapidly and comprehensively unfolded. Shortly after National Day, the original sowing plan of 1.34 million mu for the entire suburbs was completed. In order to achieve a greater area of stable high yield next year and supply the people of the capital with more white flour, the broad masses of farmers enthusiastically responded to the call of the Municipal Party Committee and continued to expand the wheat field sowing area, reaching 1.5 million mu by the 17th, while ensuring quality.

Now, while the suburban farmers are working hard to harvest late autumn crops, they are also continuing to rush to plant the extra wheat, and at the same time strengthening wheat field management. A wheat field management campaign is fully underway to strive to upgrade all wheat to first-class seedlings before the ground freezes, ensuring a bumper harvest next year. (Zhang Huixian)

    力争明年农业生产站在最前列
    京郊小麦种得又多又好
    本报讯　北京郊区农民优质超额完成了冬小麦的播种计划。
    今年郊区小麦播种，由于准备足、动手早，进度快，绝大部分麦田在“秋分”和“白露”两个节令里及时下了种。麦田作到了深翻一尺五左右，大多数作到了层层施肥，施肥量在五万斤以上，平整土地基本上实现了园田化。下种都在四十斤以上，并且多是精选的良种。现在种得较早的麦田已经是一片油绿色，麦苗长得格外茂密茁壮，有的麦苗已开始分蘖。
    抢种冬小麦期间，郊区广泛开展了全民大辩论，解放思想、提高认识，广大社员鼓起了干劲，要力争在明年使郊区小麦的亩产量站在全国最前列。他们举行了力争小麦产量跃进誓师大会，并派大批干部和社员到外地参观、学习了增产经验。一入9月，深翻麦田和播种工作即迅速全面展开。过国庆节不久，就完成了全郊区原订一百三十四万亩的播种计划。为了取得明年更大面积的稳定丰收，供应首都人民更多的白面，广大农民热烈地响应市委的号召，继续扩大麦田播种面积，到17日达到了一百五十万亩，并保证了质量。
    现在，郊区农民正在紧张地抢收晚秋作物的同时，一方面继续抢种超额麦，一方面加强麦田管理。一个力争在上冻以前把全部小麦提升为一类苗，保证明年大丰收的麦田管理运动，正在全面展开。（张慧贤）
