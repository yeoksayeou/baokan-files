Xinhua News Agency, October 16th - Based on the great achievements in work-study programs, Beijing Chemical Industry School began implementing a half-work, half-study system this semester. Each academic year will have twenty-four weeks dedicated to production labor and twenty-two weeks dedicated to study. During concentrated labor periods, there will be two hours of study each day; during concentrated study periods, one day per week will be devoted to labor.

In the first half of this year, in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, the school established eight factories. Coupled with ties to external factories and rural areas, each student participated in industrial, agricultural, and service labor for an average of more than two months. After this period of combining education with production, students' labor perspectives were cultivated. In addition, the school gained experience in organizing productive labor and accumulated some funds, making it easier for the school to continue running factories. These conditions provided ideological, organizational, and economic preparation for the school to implement the half-work, half-study system.

After participating in productive labor, teachers and students of Beijing Chemical Industry School deeply felt that the previous teaching syllabus had many impractical aspects and could not meet current needs. More than 300 students from all grades of Beijing Chemical Industry School, under the leadership of the Party committee, took workers as their teachers, held discussions with previous graduates who had already joined the workforce, and cooperated with some teachers to rewrite the new teaching syllabus for each course.

According to the results of the new semester's practice, these new teaching syllabuses, because they implemented the principles of linking theory with practice and linking with production, have the following major characteristics: First, professional courses are mainly taught on-site. Generally, students first engage in labor and then learn theory, or learn theory while engaging in labor. Second, teaching, productive labor, and scientific research are closely integrated. The content of teaching not only serves current production but also serves to further improve production, so it permeates the content of scientific research. Third, the new teaching syllabus, on the one hand, adapts to production needs and increases many practical contents, such as physics, drawing, engineering mechanics, chemical engineering principles, inorganic process and other courses are more enriched than in the past, and chemical machinery courses are added. On the other hand, it streamlined many impractical things in the old textbooks. Fourth, it added a labor syllabus that never existed before, including the arrangement of various labor times on and off campus for three years and the requirements to be met. In this way, not only is the teaching content greatly enriched and improved, but also the study period can be shortened by one year. This major reform in teaching has also created favorable conditions for the school to implement the half-work, half-study system, ensuring that students can learn richer and more applicable knowledge in a relatively compact time.

After changing the four-year system to a three-year system, Beijing Chemical Industry School also plans to change the past thirty-three weeks of vacation to ten weeks, the examination time from fourteen weeks to six weeks, and each class from forty-five minutes to sixty minutes, so that students can maintain the same number of study hours on campus as before the half-work, half-study system, with more than 3,100 hours. In addition to ensuring the teaching time for basic and professional courses, the political courses can also be increased from more than 190 hours in the past to more than 550 hours to strengthen students' political education.

Beijing Chemical Industry School has been self-sufficient after implementing work-study programs in the first half of this year. It is expected that after the implementation of the half-work, half-study system, the income from productive labor will exceed seven times the self-sufficiency level.

### 劳动不忘读书　读书不忘劳动  北京化学工业学校实行半工半读

    劳动不忘读书　读书不忘劳动
    北京化学工业学校实行半工半读
    据新华社16日讯　在勤工俭学取得巨大成绩的基础上，北京化学工业学校从本学期开始实行半工半读。每个学年有二十四周从事生产劳动，二十二周学习。在集中劳动的时候，每天有两小时学习；在集中学习的时候，每周从事一天劳动。
    今年上半年，这个学校在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，办起了八个工厂，加上和校外工厂、农村挂钩，每个学生平均参加工、农业生产和服务性劳动的时间有两个多月。经过这一时间教育结合生产后，培养了学生们的劳动观点，另外，使学校取得了组织生产劳动的经验，还积累了一部分经费，便于学校继续办工厂。这些条件，为学校实行半工半读在思想、组织和经济上作了准备。
    北京化学工业学校的师生由于参加生产劳动后，深感过去的教学大纲，有许多不切合实际的地方，不能适应目前的需要。北京化学工业学校各年级学生三百多人，今年上半年，曾经在党委领导下，拜工人为师，找已经参加工作的前几届毕业同学座谈，和部分教员合作，重新编写了各门功课的新的教学大纲。
    根据新学年实践的结果证明，这些新的教学大纲因为贯彻了联系实际、联系生产的原则，有下列几大特点：一、专业课以现场教学为主。一般都是先劳动然后学理论，或者边劳动边学理论。二、教学、生产劳动和科学研究密切结合。教学的内容，不但为当前的生产服务，而且为进一步提高生产服务，因此都贯穿着科学研究的内容。三、新教学大纲一方面适应生产需要，增加了许多适用的内容，如物理、制图、工程力学、化工原理、无机物工艺等课内容都比过去充实了，增加了化工机械课等。一方面，又精简了旧教材中许多不切合实际的东西。四、增加了过去从来没有过的劳动大纲，内容包括三年的校内校外各种劳动时间的安排和要达到的要求。这样，不但教学内容大大丰富、提高了，而且还能使学习年限缩短一年。这种教学上的大改革，也为学校实行半工半读创造了有利条件。保证学生能在较紧凑的时间内，学到更丰富、适用的知识。
    这个学校实行半工半读把四年制改为三年制以后，还准备将过去三十三周的假期改为十周，考试时间由十四周改为六周，每节课由四十五分钟改为六十分钟，使学生在校学习时间能保持到和半工半读以前一样，有三千一百多小时。除保证各项基础课和专业课授课时间外，还可以把政治课从过去的一百九十多小时增到五百五十多小时，以加强学生们的政治教育。
    北京化学工业学校今年上半年实行勤工俭学后已经能自给自足，预计半工半读后，生产劳动所得将要超过自给自足的七倍。
