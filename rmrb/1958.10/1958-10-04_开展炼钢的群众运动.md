Editorial: Launch a Mass Movement for Steelmaking

On the eve of National Day, the steel front released high-yield “satellites.” On September 29th, the national steel production was close to 60,000 tons, and pig iron production was close to 300,000 tons. Now, more than 50 million people across the country are directly involved in the battle, and a vigorous mass movement to develop the steel industry has taken shape. As long as we continue to forge ahead, the production target of 10.7 million tons of steel will definitely be completed and exceeded.

We once said that the key to producing 10.7 million tons of steel is pig iron. In the past month or so, thanks to the vigorous efforts of Party committees at all levels in grasping pig iron, and finding the method of small (small blast furnaces), indigenous (indigenous blast furnaces), and mass (mass movement), the number of indigenous blast furnaces built across the country has increased from more than 200,000 to more than 600,000. Production is becoming more normal and stable day by day. On September 29th, nine provinces with a daily output of 10,000 tons and seventy-three counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons had emerged across the country. We believe that in October, provinces with a daily output of 10,000 tons and counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons will definitely increase further, and the national daily output of pig iron will definitely leap forward again. From the current situation, it is relatively certain that the pig iron production target for this year can be completed. Of course, there are still many problems in pig iron production that need to be further resolved, such as how to consolidate the existing output so that the leap-forward output can be stabilized; how to improve the quality of pig iron and gradually reduce the amount of second-class iron and sintered iron; how to improve equipment to ensure that small blast furnaces can operate normally and stably, and prepare small blast furnaces for the winter, etc., all of which must be continued to be resolved through further efforts. However, as far as the conditions for doubling steel production this year are concerned, the hurdle of pig iron production can be said to have been basically overcome on a national scale.

What needs to be particularly grasped now is steel. Although steel production has increased to a certain extent since September, especially the new record of nearly 60,000 tons of daily output created on September 29th, which is encouraging good news, the growth rate of steel is still relatively slow compared with the growth rate of pig iron. This is because Party committees at all levels mainly focused on iron in September, rather than steel. It was of course right to focus on iron first, because steel can only be made with iron. Grasping iron is for the sake of grasping steel better. When pig iron production has already shown promise, the Party committee must immediately free up its hands to grasp steel, grasping both iron and steel, so that steel production can also make a leap. Otherwise, even if the pig iron plan is overfulfilled, there is still a risk that the steel plan will not be completed.

Whether steel production can leap forward also depends on whether the methods of small (small converters, small open-hearth furnaces), indigenous (indigenous steelmaking methods), and mass (mass movement) are adopted. The methods of small, indigenous, and mass are extremely important methods for developing China's industry at high speed. In ironmaking, adopting this method, within a month, a vigorous mass ironmaking movement appeared throughout the country, and high-yield "satellites" of provinces with a daily output of 10,000 tons and counties with a daily output of 1,000 tons flew into the sky one after another, and the passive situation was turned into an active one. Those who originally doubted that indigenous ironmaking could solve the problem now believe it. However, in steelmaking, there are still many people who only believe in "foreign" methods and do not believe in "indigenous" methods, thinking that indigenous ironmaking can succeed, but indigenous steelmaking cannot. It is universally known that "foreign" steelmaking methods have high efficiency, low cost, and relatively high quality. The eighteen key iron and steel enterprises are the main force in completing the 10.7 million tons of steel this year. The gap between advanced and backward within these key enterprises is still very large, and the production potential has not been fully realized. In these enterprises, there are still some cadres and engineering and technical personnel who have the mentality of Jia Gui, thinking that all technical conclusions of foreigners and predecessors are golden rules that cannot be changed at all. We must organize the masses of workers in these enterprises to conduct a great airing of views, great debates, and further break superstitions, emancipate the mind, and mobilize the masses more deeply, thoroughly, and broadly, and carry out a technical revolution on a large scale, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can become even more advanced, and give full play to the role of these key enterprises. This is of course very important. At the same time, we must now speed up the production of modern steelmaking equipment, and we will also produce a large amount of such equipment in the future. There is also no doubt about this. However, relying solely on these eighteen key enterprises and solely on the new equipment being manufactured cannot guarantee the completion of the task of doubling steel production in such a short period of time. We must also vigorously engage in indigenous steelmaking. Without engaging in indigenous steelmaking, it would be impossible to form a vigorous mass movement. The news from Sichuan, Zibo, Yuci, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou published in this newspaper on September 27th, and the news from Shanghai and Tianjin published in this newspaper on October 3rd all show that indigenous methods can not only produce ordinary steel, but also produce high-quality steel. The idea that indigenous steelmaking will not work is unfounded. Long before "foreign" steelmaking technology was introduced into our country, our ancestors had already used indigenous methods to make steel. In ancient China, there were legends of Gan Jiang and Mo Ye forging precious swords, and there were also many precious swords that "cut iron like mud." The steel used for these swords was made by indigenous methods. Our ancestors were able to make steel by indigenous methods. Now that we have the correct leadership of our Party and the people who have mastered their own destiny, why can't we make steel by indigenous methods?

The question of whether or not to adopt the methods of small, indigenous, and mass is essentially the question of whether or not to combine large, medium, and small, whether or not to combine indigenous and foreign, and whether or not to follow the mass line. Like ironmaking, in the current specific circumstances, whoever believes in "foreign" methods and focuses only on "foreign" methods will see their steel production grow very slowly and fail to leap forward; whoever believes in "indigenous" methods and believes in "indigenous" methods early will see their steel production leap forward early. Henan Province adopted the methods of small, indigenous, and mass to engage in steel, and the situation of steel greatly changed. Within a few days, more than 5,000 indigenous steelmaking furnaces were built, and it is planned that 50,000 will be built by the end of the month. In October, a daily output of 5,000 tons of steel can be achieved, ensuring that the annual steel production task of over 100,000 tons is exceeded. Since September 12th, Shanxi Province decided to engage in steel using the methods of small, indigenous, and mass. In a few days, a mass movement of indigenous steelmaking was formed. The masses are experimenting everywhere with great enthusiasm. They will not leave the "front line" if the experiment fails. The experiment of using indigenous open-hearth furnaces to make steel in Gu County has been successful, and the experiment of using indigenous crucibles to make steel in Yangquan has also been successful. They estimate that after National Day, the province's steel production capacity can reach a daily output of 7,000 tons. Now, the steel production of these two provinces has jumped up, and it is jumping up very quickly. Why does steel production leap forward when the methods of small, indigenous, and mass are adopted for steelmaking? What is the secret? It is very simple to explain. Indigenous steelmaking is a magic weapon passed down by our ancestors for thousands of years, and many people among the masses understand it. This is one. Second, indigenous steelmaking does not require any equipment, and you can be self-reliant without asking for help from anyone. Third, it does not require much investment, and it can be started in a short period of time. Once these characteristics are combined with China's abundant and dispersed mineral resources, large population, and underdeveloped mechanical industry, we can give full play to the advantages of large population and dispersed resources to develop the iron and steel industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, the methods of small, indigenous, and mass are the best way to mobilize millions of people to participate in the construction of the iron and steel industry, a way to be "self-reliant without asking for help from anyone," and a way to be self-reliant. This method can be used not only to develop the iron and steel industry, but also to develop the coal industry and the transportation industry. If we only engage in large ones and do not engage in small ones at the same time, if we only engage in "foreign" ones and do not engage in "indigenous" ones at the same time, we can only walk on one leg. The iron and steel industry and other industries can only be run by a few experts and workers in modern enterprises, and can only be run by the central competent departments and provinces and cities. Hundreds of millions of farmers can only stand by and watch, and can only provide spiritual support and cannot do anything. Under the current specific conditions in our country, the result of doing so can only be cold and quiet, and less, slower, worse, and more expensive. While building large "foreign" factories and mines, and at the same time adopting indigenous, small, and mass methods, we can walk on two legs. Hundreds of millions of farmers will not only be able to stand by and watch, and will not only be able to provide spiritual support, but everyone will be able to do it, and everyone will be able to contribute their skills. Cities can run industries, and rural areas can also run industries. Government agencies, schools, and street residents can all run industries. Workers in this industry can make steel and iron, and workers, farmers, city residents, students, and cadres who are not in this industry can also make steel and iron. In this way, we can mobilize tens of millions of people to go to the mountains, we can launch a mass movement on a large scale, and the result will inevitably be a vigorous, greater, faster, better, and more economical result.

October is a decisive month for completing and exceeding the steel production target of 10.7 million tons. This is not only because October is closer to the end of the year, but also because a lot of preparatory work has been done in September, and the leap-forward situation of iron has been formed. Now, the first secretaries of the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees, district committees, and county committees have all shifted the focus of their leadership to the iron and steel industry, and tens of millions of people have also taken action. The decisive factors for the leap-forward development of the iron and steel industry have been fully met. We must make full use of this favorable condition and work hard in October. We must use the method of engaging in agriculture to engage in the iron and steel industry, politics plus technology, the Party committee secretary taking command, the combination of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers, and engage in iron and steel experimental fields on a large scale. In agricultural production, we have achieved a comprehensive, unprecedented, and large-scale bumper harvest by using the method of politics plus technology and the method of engaging in experimental fields. Using the same method to engage in the iron and steel industry will also surely achieve a comprehensive, unprecedented, and large-scale bumper harvest!

### 开展炼钢的群众运动

    开展炼钢的群众运动
    国庆前夕，钢铁战线大放“卫星”，9月29日这一天，全国钢的产量已接近六万吨，生铁的产量已接近三十万吨。现在，全国每天有五千多万群众直接投入战斗，一个生气勃勃的大办钢铁工业的群众运动已经形成了。只要我们继续奋勇前进，一千零七十万吨钢的生产任务一定能完成和超额完成。
    我们曾经说过，生产一千零七十万吨钢的关键是生铁。一个多月来，由于各级党委大力抓生铁，找到了小（小高炉）土（土高炉）群（群众运动）的办法，全国建成的土高炉已经从二十多万座增加到六十多万座，生产一天比一天正常，一天比一天稳定。9月29日，全国已经出现了九个万吨省，七十三个千吨县。我们相信，在10月份内，日产万吨省，日产千吨县必将更加多起来，全国生铁的日产量一定还可以飞跃再飞跃。从目前的形势来看，完成今年生铁生产任务是比较有把握了。当然，生铁生产中还有不少问题需要进一步解决，例如关于如何巩固现有的产量，使跃进的产量能够稳定下来；关于如何提高生铁的质量，逐步减少二等铁和烧结铁；关于如何改进设备，保证小高炉能够正常的稳定的生产，并准备小高炉过冬等等，都必须继续努力加以解决。但是，今年完成钢产翻一番的条件，就全国范围来说，生铁生产这一关可以说基本上过了。
    现在需要特别抓紧的是钢。9月份以来，钢的生产虽然有了一定的增长，特别是9月29日创造了日产量近六万吨的新纪录，更是鼓舞人心的好消息，但同生铁增长的速度比较起来，钢的增长速度还是比较慢的。这是因为9月份各级党委主要是抓铁，而不是抓钢。首先抓铁当然是对的，因为有铁才能炼钢。抓铁是为了更好地抓钢，当生铁的生产已经有了眉目的时候，党委必须立即分出手来抓钢，既抓铁又抓钢，让钢的产量也来一个飞跃。要不然，即使超额完成了生铁的计划，钢的计划仍有完不成的危险。
    钢产量能不能飞跃，关键也在于是不是采取小（小转炉、小平炉）、土（土法炼钢）、群（群众运动）的办法。小、土、群的办法，是高速度地发展我国工业的极端重要办法。在炼铁方面，采取了这个办法，不出一个月的时间，就在全国范围内出现了蓬蓬勃勃的群众炼铁运动，日产万吨省、千吨县的高产“卫星”就一个接着一个飞上天，被动局面就变为主动局面。原来怀疑土法炼铁能够解决问题的人，现在都相信了。但是，在炼钢方面，还有很多人只信“洋”，不信“土”，认为土法炼铁成，土法炼钢不成。“洋”法炼钢效率高，成本低，质量比较高，这是谁也知道的。十八个重点钢铁企业是完成今年一千零七十万吨钢的主力军。在这些重点企业之间，先进与落后的差别仍然很大，生产潜力还没有充分发挥出来。在这些企业里，仍然有一部分干部和工程技术人员有贾桂思想，认为外国的和前人的一切技术结论都是金科玉律，一点也不能改动。我们必须在这些企业里组织职工群众大鸣、大放、大辩论，进一步破除迷信，解放思想，更深更透更广地把群众发动起来，大闹技术革命，让落后的赶上先进的，让先进的更加先进，充分发挥这些重点企业的作用。这当然是十分重要的。同时，我们现在也要加紧生产现代化的炼钢设备，将来也还要大量生产这样的设备。这也是没有疑问的。但是，仅仅靠这十八个重点企业，仅仅靠正在制造的新的设备，还不能保证在如此短促的时间内完成钢产翻一番的任务，还必须大搞土法炼钢。不搞土法炼钢，就不可能形成蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动。9月27日本报发表四川、淄博、榆次、兰州和广州的消息，10月3日本报发表的上海、天津的消息都说明，土法不仅可以炼出普通的钢来，而且可以炼出质量优良的钢来。那种认为土法炼钢不行的想法是没有根据的。远在“洋”的炼钢技术没有传入我国以前，我们的祖先就已经用土法炼出钢来。我国古代有干将莫邪炼宝剑的传说，也有过许多“削铁如泥”的宝剑，这些宝剑所用的钢就是用土法炼出来的。我们的祖先能够用土法炼钢，现在有我们党的正确领导，掌握了自己命运的人民，为什么反而不能用土法炼钢呢？
    要不要采取小、土、群办法的问题，实质上就是要不要大中小相结合的问题，要不要土洋并举的问题，要不要群众路线的问题。炼钢和炼铁一样，在当前的具体情况下，谁迷信“洋”的，一心只搞“洋”的，谁的钢产量就增长得很慢，不能飞跃；谁相信“土”的，早相信“土”的，谁的钢产量就能早飞跃。河南省采用小、土、群的办法搞钢，钢的情况就大大改观，几天之内就建成了五千多座土炼钢炉，计划到月底可以建成五万座，10月份可以达到日产钢五千吨，保证超额十万吨完成全年的产钢任务。山西省9月12日起决定以小、土、群的办法搞钢以后，几天功夫，就形成了群众性的土法炼钢的运动。群众到处在试验，热情高涨，试验不成不下“火线”，故县试验用土平炉炼钢已经成功，阳泉用土坩锅炼钢也已成功。他们估计，国庆节以后全省产钢能力就可以达到日产七千吨。现在，这两个省的钢产都跳跃上去了，而且跳跃得很快。为什么采取小、土、群的办法炼钢，钢的产量就飞跃呢？其奥妙何在呢？说开来非常简单。土法炼钢是我们的祖先几千年间传下来的法宝，群众中懂得的人很多，这是一。第二、土法炼钢不需要什么设备，可以万事不求人，自力更生。第三，也不需要多大投资，而且不需要多长时间就可以搞起来。这几个特点一旦和我国矿产资源丰富而分散、人口众多、目前机械工业不发达等特点结合起来，我们就可以充分利用人多、资源分散的优点，多快好省地发展钢铁工业。所以，小、土、群的办法，是动员千百万群众参加钢铁工业建设的最好办法，是“万事不求人”的办法，是自力更生的办法。这个办法，不只可以用来发展钢铁工业，也可以用来发展煤炭工业和交通运输业。只搞大的而不同时搞小的，只搞“洋”的而不同时搞“土”的，我们就只能一条腿走路。钢铁工业和其它工业就只能由少数专家和在现代企业中的工人来办，只能由中央的主管部和省、市一级来办，几亿农民就只能站在旁边看，只能精神支援，不能动手。在目前我国的具体条件下，这样做的结果就只能是冷冷清清，少慢差费。在建设大的“洋”的工厂矿山的同时，又采取土、小、群的办法，我们就可以两条腿走路。几亿农民就不是只能站在旁边看，不会只是精神支援，而是人人动手，个个献技，城市可以办，农村也可以办工业，机关、学校、街道居民都可以办工业；本行业的工人可以炼钢炼铁，非本行业的工人、农民、市民、学生、干部也可以炼钢炼铁。这样，我们就可以动员几千万群众上山，就可以大搞群众运动，其结果就必然是轰轰烈烈，多快好省。
    10月是对于完成和超额完成钢一千零七十万吨生产任务具有决定性的一个月。这不只是因为10月离年终更近了，而且因为9月份已经做了很多准备工作，铁的飞跃形势已经形成。现在，省、市、自治区党委、地委、县委的第一书记都已把领导的重心转到钢铁工业方面来，几千万人民群众也已行动起来。对钢铁工业飞跃发展具有决定性的因素都已具备。我们必须充分利用这个有利条件，在10月份内大干一场。我们必须用搞农业的办法来搞钢铁工业，政治加技术，党委书记挂帅，领导干部、工程技术人员和工人三方面结合，大搞钢铁试验田。在农业生产中，我们用政治加技术的办法，用搞试验田的办法，取得了全面的空前的大面积丰收。用同样的办法来搞钢铁工业，也一定取得全面的空前的大面积丰收！
