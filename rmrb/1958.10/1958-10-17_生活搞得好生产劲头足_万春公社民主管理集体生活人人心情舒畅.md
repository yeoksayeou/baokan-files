Good Life Leads to High Production Enthusiasm
Wanchun Commune Democratically Manages Collective Life, Everyone is Happy

    (Our Dispatch) The canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, and laundry groups of the Wanchun People's Commune in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, are being run better and better, powerfully promoting the consolidation of the commune and the development of production.

    The Wanchun People's Commune was established in early September and has more than 18,000 households. In the past month, many canteens throughout the commune have gone from being unsatisfactory to clean and hygienic, serving hot meals with fragrant dishes, on time, and have increased the variety of dishes. They have also added noodles, steamed buns, and soft rice for the elderly and children. Each team has also concentrated nurseries, laundry groups, etc., near the canteens to facilitate women to look after their children and handle living matters.

    After the establishment of the Wanchun People's Commune, more than 500 canteens and more than 400 nurseries, sewing groups, and laundry groups were established. However, in the beginning, due to the idea among some cadres that they attached importance to production and neglected life, thinking that living welfare issues were "minor matters," the relevant problems were not solved in time, resulting in some production teams running their canteens poorly, causing many complaints from the commune members, affecting production enthusiasm, and disrupting production arrangements. After studying this situation, the Commune Party Committee led all cadres in conducting a major debate on collective living issues. Through the debate, all cadres unanimously realized that organizing collective life well is a serious political task, a guarantee for organizing a great leap in production, involving the thorough change of farmers' lifestyles for thousands of years, and directly affecting the consolidation of the commune.

    After unifying understanding, there was immediate improvement in the management of collective life throughout the commune. The commune and brigades both appointed a deputy director and deputy captain to specifically manage life, and each squadron also established a food management committee. The commune immediately convened an on-site meeting of public canteens to introduce advanced canteen experiences. Economic disclosure and democratic management were also implemented, adhering to the practice of the mass line.

    With the improvement of collective life, all commune members are happy and love the commune even more. The attendance rate of the entire commune has consistently remained above 90% recently. After the young and strong men supported the iron and steel front, the women commune members assumed the main labor within the commune. In the past ten days or so, the entire commune has deep-plowed more than 10,000 mu of land, all at one and a half chi or more, and has vigorously engaged in smoked soil fertilizer, the amount of which has exceeded several times the early stage of the commune's establishment.

    生活搞得好生产劲头足
    万春公社民主管理集体生活人人心情舒畅
    本报讯　四川省温江县万春人民公社的食堂、托儿所、缝纫组和洗衣组愈办愈好，有力地促进了公社的巩固和生产发展。
    万春人民公社是9月上旬建立的，共有一万八千多户。一个月来全社许多食堂已从原来的不够使人满意做到清洁卫生，饭热菜香，按时开饭，增加了饭菜花色品种，还为老年、儿童添了面条、馒头和软饭。各队还把托儿所、洗衣组等集中在食堂附近，便利妇女看孩子和处理生活问题。
    万春人民公社建立后，共建立了五百多个食堂和四百多个托儿所、缝纫组以及洗衣组。但在开始，由于部分干部存在重生产、轻生活的思想，认为生活福利问题是“小事”，没有及时解决有关的问题，以致有些生产队的食堂办得不好，社员意见很多，影响了生产情绪，也打乱了生产安排。公社党委研究这一情况后，领导全体干部开展了对集体生活问题的大辩论。通过辩论，全体干部一致认识到：组织好集体生活是一个严重的政治任务，这是组织生产大跃进的一个保证，涉及千百年来农民生活方式的彻底改变，也直接影响公社的巩固。
    统一认识以后，全社集体生活的管理方面立刻大有改善。公社和大队都指定一个副社长和副队长专门管生活，各中队也都建立伙食管理委员会。全社立即召开了公共食堂现场会议，介绍先进食堂经验。并且实行了经济公开和民主管理，坚持群众路线的做法。
    随着集体生活的改善，全社社员人人心情舒畅，更加热爱公社。全社近来出工率一直保持90％以上，妇女社员们在青壮男子支援钢铁战线以后，担负了社内的主要劳动。全社近十多天深耕土地一万多亩，都在一尺五以上，并且大搞熏土肥，数量都超过建社初期几倍。　（于竞祁）
