Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 18th. The survey team for the route to divert water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to replenish the Yellow River has returned to Zhengzhou recently, victoriously, after nearly six months of arduous work and a journey of more than 32,000 *li*. The conclusion of the survey is that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau have abundant water reserves and suitable elevations for diversion. It is entirely feasible to divert water to the Yellow River north of the Qinling Mountains by gravity flow. The flow rate diverted to replenish the Yellow River can reach 4,500 cubic meters per second, with an annual volume of 142 billion cubic meters, or even more.

In recent years, due to the great development of industrial and agricultural production in the vast areas along the Yellow River, the water volume of the Yellow River has become increasingly insufficient. The Yangtze River, on the other hand, has an inexhaustible and abundant water supply. In order to enable these two major rivers to join hands and better serve the socialist construction of the motherland, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission formed a survey team in March this year. In April, the team arrived in Chengdu and, with the strong assistance of the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Department, officially began its work. The team consisted of eighteen people. In Chengdu, they extensively collected various materials related to diverting the Yangtze to replenish the Yellow River, supplemented their instruments, exchanged views with relevant departments, and selected a survey route for water diversion. In late April, the team officially began surveying from Kangding, and in late September, they completed the field survey work, finalizing the survey report in Minxian County, Gansu Province.

The scope of this survey extended east to the western edge of the Sichuan Basin, west to the banks of the Jinsha River near Gangtu in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, south to Xichang in Sichuan Province, and north to Dingxi and Tianshui in Gansu Province. Wherever they went, they received strong support and assistance from the local Party and government organs.

The main rivers surveyed during this trip included the middle and upper reaches of the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, whose tributaries have abundant water and frequently encounter mountain springs and waterfalls; the upper reaches of the Min River, Fujiang River, and Bailong River, whose continuous flow of water also rolls down. However, the Yellow River water system they passed through, with the exception of the Tao River, the upper reaches of the Wei River and Zuli River were dry gullies and riverbeds, with hardly any water flow visible. The main mountain ranges they surveyed included the towering snow-capped Que'er Mountain, Bayan Har Mountain, and Daxue Mountain, as well as the Yak Mountain, Xiaoxiangling Mountain, Yeniu Mountain, Erlang Mountain, Min Mountain, and Qinling Mountains, all of which are above the clouds.

During the survey, they selected four water diversion routes for comparison. All four water diversion routes diverted water from the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River, passed through the valleys of each river and the upper reaches of the Min River, Fujiang River, Bailong River, etc., and entered the main stream of the Yellow River below Jishi Mountain, or crossed the Qinling Mountains to enter the Tao River and Wei River, tributaries of the Yellow River. The third route even crossed the Wei River to enter the Zuli River. The water collection area of the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and Dadu River above an elevation of 2,000 meters is approximately 420,000 square kilometers, with a total annual water volume of 142 billion cubic meters, which is only 13% of the total water volume of the Yangtze River.

### 南水北调　江河携手  黄委会将引长江水接济黄河

    南水北调　江河携手
    黄委会将引长江水接济黄河
    新华社郑州18日电　引长江上游水接济黄河路线查勘队行程三万二千多里，经过近六个月的艰苦工作，已在最近胜利地回到郑州。查勘的结论是：在川藏高原上的长江上游有丰富的水量可惜，有适当的高程可引，完全可以用自流方式调引到秦岭以北的黄河里来；引来济黄的流量可达四千五百秒公方，每年可达一千四百二十亿公方，甚至可以更多。
    黄河沿河广大地区近几年由于工农业生产大发展，黄河的水量已愈来愈感不足；而长江却有取用不竭的充沛水量。为了使这两条大河携起手来，更好地为祖国的社会主义建设服务，黄河水利委员会在今年3月间组成查勘组，4月到达成都，并在四川省水利部门的大力协助下正式开始了活动。这个队共有十八个人。他们在成都广泛地收集了有关引江济黄的各种资料，补充了仪器，并和有关部门交换了意见，选定了引水查勘线路。4月下旬正式从康定开始查勘，9月下旬完成野外勘测工作，最后在甘肃省岷县完成了查勘报告。
    这次查勘的范围，东到四川盆地西部边缘，西至长江上游金沙江岗托沿岸，南达四川省西昌，北抵甘肃省定西、天水。所到之处，都得到了当地党政机关的大力支持和帮助。
    他们这次查勘经过的主要河流，有金沙江、雅砻江、大渡河的中游和上游，这些干支流水量丰富，常遇到山泉瀑布；有岷江、涪江、白龙江的上游，这些河流的源源不绝的水量也滚滚而下。但是他们经过的黄河水系，除洮河外，渭河、祖厉河的上游都是沟干河涸，几乎看不到水流。他们查勘经过的主要山脉，有雪顶冲天的雀儿山、巴颜喀拉山、大雪山等，经过的牦牛山、小相岭、野牛山、二郎山、岷山、秦岭等也都在云端以上。
    他们在查勘中，选择了四条作为比较的引水线路。这四条引水线路，都是从金沙江、雅砻江、大渡河引水，经过各江的山谷和岷江、涪江、白龙江等江河的上游，分别在积石山下入黄河干流，或跨秦岭入黄河支流洮河、渭河，其中第三条线路，更越过渭河入祖厉河。金沙江、雅砻江、大渡河在海拔二千公尺高程以上的集水面积，约有四十二万平方公里，年总水量有一千四百二十亿公方，这些水量，仅为长江总水量的13％。
