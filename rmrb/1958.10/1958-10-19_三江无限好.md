The moment you enter Sanjiang, it feels like you've arrived in a land of folk songs.

The car speeds along the mountain road. From afar, the male and female commune members working hard in the rice paddies on both sides of the road greet the car with cheerful smiles and sing melodious folk songs. These songs are the welcome from the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang to the more than one hundred representatives from all over the country attending the National Ethnic Work On-site Observation Conference. The car has long disappeared into the valley, but the singing still echoes on the hillside.

Countless folk songs are not only sung on people's lips but also written on the walls of villages and the memorial arches standing along the roads, leaving one dazzled. They praise their hometown in this way: "Clouds embrace the mountains, and the mountains support the rivers; the birds sing, and the flowers are fragrant, surpassing paradise; the rice seedlings in the fields are higher than the ridges, and the fir trees on the mountains pierce the sky." When realizing the people's communes, they joyfully sang: "Communism is heaven, the people's commune is like the sun. As long as we follow the sun, the road to heaven is not long."

Listening to and seeing these folk songs makes one feel more and more invigorated and happy. It makes one feel that the people of all ethnic groups here are so full of ideals.

In this high and cold mountainous area, the slogan of striving for a grain yield of 20,000 jin per mu in the county this year has taken root in the hearts of the people. Whether in the fields, at the edge of villages, or on the roads, many wooden signs can be seen with the slogan: "We must achieve a double 10,000-jin county!" On the wooden signs beside many late rice "satellite fields," there are also targets of 50,000 jin, 100,000 jin, or even higher per mu. The names of the "satellite field drivers" are written on the wooden signs, as well as the measures to achieve the targets, indicating that those astonishing targets are not empty words but concrete actions and goals to be achieved.

The double 10,000-jin target is equivalent to 107 times the average yield per mu before liberation (1949) and 33 times the average yield per mu last year. This target was proposed based on the average yield of 1,000 jin per mu achieved in the early rice this year.

The grain issue is a tragic history for the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang and a history of people's victorious struggle in the past year. In the past, Sanjiang was a severely grain-deficient county. Before liberation, the average yield per mu was only a little over 100 jin, and the people of all ethnic groups lived a tragic and impoverished life. At that time, a miserable folk song was popular: "It's so difficult, half a jin of white rice cooks three meals; porridge is cooked in a clay pot, and spoonfuls are scooped, how could one ever have a full meal?" After liberation, land reform was implemented through peaceful consultation in 1954. In the past few years, grain production has increased year after year, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have also improved to a certain extent. However, every year, the county still had to organize more than 400,000 person-times to go to Guizhou and Hunan to carry grain, crossing mountains and ridges for hundreds of miles back and forth. Out of the county's more than 500 cadres, more than 400 cadres were busy with grain work every year.

In the all-people rectification movement, they thoroughly smashed those national scum and right-wing elements, and in the debate between the two roads, they raised their class consciousness, sharpened their eyes, and understood more clearly that only by following the Communist Party and taking the socialist road can the most serious grain problem be solved.

This year, they also shattered the arguments that "mountain areas cannot compare with plains" and "ethnic minorities cannot compare with Han Chinese." They shattered the theories of specialness and backwardness and were determined to carry out socialist construction at the highest speed and change the poor and backward face in the shortest possible time. They sing everywhere: "Singing songs cannot be separated from the general line, production cannot be separated from striving for the upstream, going all out, aiming high, and advancing by leaps and bounds, all special cases of backwardness must be discarded." "The dark night is like daytime, grit our teeth and work for a year, change backwardness to surpass the advanced, the mountainous area must surpass the plains." They boldly selected Chao'an County in Guangdong, the first county in the country to achieve 1,000 jin of rice per mu in 1955, as their opponent and put forward the slogan: "Learn from Chao'an, catch up with Chao'an."

Who said "Sanjiang is high in the mountains and the water is cold, so two crops cannot be planted"? The people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang changed the thousand-year-old convention and changed one crop of rice to two crops, making a big push for technological revolution in production. As a result, the county achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of 1,021 jin per mu on average for early rice, becoming the first early rice 1,000-jin county in ethnic minority areas in the country, changing from a severely grain-deficient county in history to a surplus grain county.

Compared with the grain issue, Sanjiang's industry was even more of a blank slate before liberation. People describe the degree of whiteness by saying that even if the iron pot was broken, there was no one to mend it. While solving the grain problem, the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang also began industrial construction. In the past four or five months, they have started more than 4,000 factories and mines from scratch. Of the 47 newly built indigenous blast furnaces, 11 have already produced molten iron.

Starting from scratch. With working hands, anything can be created. There is a large couplet at the entrance of the county people's committee. The first line reads: "Eighteen thousand iron-willed and ambitious hearts, determined to surpass Britain and catch up with the United States, not to mention a few thousand factories and mines." The second line reads: "Eighteen thousand pairs of laboring giant hands, wanting to move mountains and rivers, let alone double ten thousand jin per mu." In Sanjiang, the power of 180,000 hearts and 180,000 pairs of hands can be seen everywhere. We visited the Sanjiang County Farm Implement Factory, the first factory in Sanjiang to manufacture ball bearings. The factory had neither power nor machine tools, and the workers had never even heard of the term ball bearing in the past. But with a pair of pliers and a hammer, they made a complete set of ball bearings, hammer by hammer. (Attached picture)

    三江无限好
    本报记者  赵慎应　黄昌禄
    进入三江，犹如来到了一个山歌之乡。
    汽车奔驰在山间公路上，在公路两旁稻田里紧张劳动的男男女女公社社员们，很远就迎着汽车，欢笑着，唱出了婉转动人的山歌。这是三江各族人民在欢迎到此参加全国民族工作现场观摩会议的来自全国各地的一百多个代表。汽车早在山谷里消失，歌声还在山坡上飘荡。
    无数山歌不仅唱在人们的嘴上，还写在村寨里的墙壁上和耸立路旁的牌坊上，使人耳目应接不暇。他们是这样赞美自己的家乡：“云拥山腰山扶川，鸟语花香赛桃源，田中稻苗高过岭，山上杉木顶破天。”在实现人民公社时，他们欢乐地歌颂：“共产主义是天堂，人民公社像太阳，只要跟着太阳走，要上天堂路不长。”
    听着和看着这些山歌，使人精神越来越焕发，心情越来越舒畅。使人感到，这里各族人民是那样富于理想。
    在这个高寒山区，争取今年全县亩产粮食两万斤的口号，已经深入人心。无论在田头、村边、道路上，到处都可以看到许多木牌上写着：“硬要实现双万斤县”的标语。在许多晚稻“卫星田”旁的木牌上还写着亩产五万斤、十万斤，甚至更高的指标，木牌上写着“卫星田驾驶人”的姓名，写着实现指标的措施，这说明那些惊人的指标不是空话，而是实实在在的行动和将要实现的目标。
    双万斤，这个指标相当于解放前（1949年）平均亩产量的一百零七倍，相当去年平均亩产的三十三倍。这个指标是在今年早稻实现平均亩产千斤的基础上提出来的。
    关于粮食问题，这是三江各族人民一部悲惨的历史，也是一年来人民胜利斗争的历史。三江过去是个严重的缺粮解县，解放前每年亩产平均只有一百多斤粮食，各族人民过着悲惨贫困的生活。当时流行着一首凄惨的山歌：“难又难，一筒（半斤）白米煮三餐，砂罐煮粥调羹舀，何曾得饱那一餐。”解放后，在1954年经过和平协商的方式实行了土地改革，几年来粮食连年增产，各族人民的生活也得到一定改善。但是每年全县还要组织四十多万人次到贵州、湖南去挑粮食，翻山越岭，来回几百里路，全县五百多名干部，每年就有四百多名干部忙着粮食工作。
    在全民整风运动中，他们彻底打垮了那些民族败类、右派分子，并在两条道路的辩论中，提高了阶级觉悟，擦亮了眼睛，更加明白了只有跟着共产党，走社会主义的道路，才能解决最严重的粮食问题。
    今年，他们又粉碎了“山区比不上平原”、“少数民族比不上汉族”的论调。粉碎了特殊论和落后论，决心以最高的速度来进行社会主义建设，在最短的时间内改变贫困落后的面貌。他们到处唱着：“唱歌不离总路线，生产不离争上游，鼓足干劲大跃进，特殊落后一概丢。”“黑夜茫茫当白天，咬紧牙关干一年，改变落后赛先进，山区硬要超平原。”他们大胆地选定1955年全国第一个水稻千斤县的广东潮安县作对手，提出口号：“学潮安，赶潮安。”
    谁说“三江山高水冷，不能种二苗”？三江各族人民改变了历史上的千年陈规，改一季稻为两季稻，大闹生产技术革命。结果，全县获得了早稻平均亩产一千零二十一斤的空前大丰收，成为全国少数民族地区第一个早稻千斤县，一变历史上的严重缺粮县而为余粮县。
    和粮食问题比较起来，三江的工业在解放前更是一张白纸，人们形容白的程度时说，连铁锅破了也找不到人补。三江各族人民在解决粮食问题的同时，也开始进行了工业建设，最近四、五个月来，他们白手起家办起了四千多个厂矿，新建成的四十七座土高炉，已有十一座流出了铁水。
    白手起家。有了劳动的手，什么都能创造出来。县人民委员会大门口有一副很大的对联，上联写着：十八万颗铁胆雄心，志在超英赶美，莫说几千厂矿。下联写着：十八万双劳动巨手，要使山移河转，何况亩产双万。在三江，到处都可看到十八万颗心和十八万双手的力量。我们参观了三江第一个制成滚珠轴承的县农具厂，这个工厂既没有动力，也没有机床，工人们过去连滚珠轴承的名词也没听说过。但他们凭着一把老虎钳、一把铁锤，一锤锤地制成了成套的滚珠轴承。（附图片）
