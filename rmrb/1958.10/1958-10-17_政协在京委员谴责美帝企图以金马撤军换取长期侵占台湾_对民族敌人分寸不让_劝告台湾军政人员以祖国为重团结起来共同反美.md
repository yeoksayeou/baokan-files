Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing held a meeting today to strongly condemn the US imperialists' heinous plot to trade the withdrawal of troops from Kinmen and Matsu for the long-term occupation of Taiwan and Penghu. In their speeches, the members earnestly advised Taiwan's military and government personnel to prioritize the motherland, turn their guns around, and unanimously oppose the common enemy, US imperialism.

In their speeches, the members expressed their full support for Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots and his order to the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front. They said that the letter and the order demonstrated the great strength and confidence in victory of the Chinese people, and reflected patriotism and national righteousness. Shao Lizi and Weng Wenhao, among others, said in their speeches: US imperialism is the common enemy of the people on the mainland and the people of Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan and the majority of patriotic military and government personnel in Taiwan understand this point. Taiwan's military and government personnel should prioritize the motherland and the nation, unite to oppose US imperialism, which is also a bright path for themselves.

Chen Qiyou, Chu Tunan, Zhu Xuefan, Li Shucheng, Liu Fei, Chen Hansheng, Wang Jiazhen, and Wang Jifan, in their speeches, all righteously and sternly refuted the so-called "ceasefire" fallacies clamored by Dulles and his ilk. They said that liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, these sacred territories of the motherland, is our country's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. Our suspension of shelling Kinmen is a matter of our internal warfare, which is completely different from the "ceasefire" clamored by US imperialism. Shao Lizi and Chu Tunan, among others, also said that US imperialism is playing various tricks, confusing the public, attempting to get Chiang Kai-shek to withdraw troops from Kinmen and Matsu, and attempting to use this as a "condition" to achieve its heinous goal of long-term occupation of Taiwan. They emphasized that Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu have been an inseparable part of our country's territory since ancient times, and we must liberate these territories. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan are Chinese, and we advocate peace talks and are generous to them, but to our national enemy, US imperialism, in a word: no concessions. The US imperialist plot to occupy Taiwan for a long time and create "two Chinas" will be thoroughly bankrupted.

Wang Yunsheng, among others, said in his speech that our opposition to US imperialism's occupation of Taiwan is part of the world's people's struggle against US aggression, and all peace-loving people in the world stand on our side. Wang Yunsheng listed the facts of US imperialism running into snags everywhere in the world and said that US imperialism is now even more isolated. The members firmly believe that the Americans staying in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait will definitely roll back in front of our people and the people of the world. If they refuse to leave, the noose around their necks will be tightened, accelerating their death.

Today's meeting was presided over by Chu Tunan, a Standing Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, attended the symposium.

    政协在京委员谴责美帝企图以金马撤军换取长期侵占台湾
    对民族敌人分寸不让
    劝告台湾军政人员以祖国为重团结起来共同反美
    新华社16日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京的一部分委员，今天举行集会，强烈谴责美帝国主义企图以金、马撤军为条件换取长期侵占台、澎的罪恶阴谋。委员们在发言中恳切劝告台湾军政人员，以祖国为重，掉转枪口，一致反对共同敌人美帝国主义。
    委员们在发言中表示完全拥护彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书和给福建前线人民解放军的命令。他们说，文告和命令表现了中国人民的巨大力量和胜利的信心，表现了爱国主义和民族大义。邵力子和翁文灏等在发言中说：美帝国主义是大陆人民和台湾人民的共同敌人，台湾人民和台湾大多数爱国的军政人员对这一点都是有体会的。台湾军政人员应该以祖国为重，以民族为重，一致团结起来反对美帝国主义，这对他们自己说来也是一条光明大道。
    陈其尤、楚图南、朱学范、李书城、刘斐、陈翰笙、王家桢、王季范在发言中，都义正词严地驳斥了杜勒斯之流叫嚣的所谓“停火”谬论。他们说，解放台、澎、金、马这些祖国的神圣领土，是我国的内政，不容外人过问。我们暂停炮击金门，这是我们内战中的事情，这同美帝国主义叫嚷的“停火”完全不同。邵力子和楚图南等还说，美帝国主义正在玩弄种种花招，混淆视听，企图让蒋介石从金、马撤军，企图以此为“条件”，达到它长期侵占台湾的罪恶目的。他们强调指出，台、澎、金、马自古以来就是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我们一定要解放这些领土。台湾的国民党军政人员是中国人，我们主张和谈，对他们宽宏大量，但是对我们民族的敌人美帝国主义，一句话：分寸不让。美帝国主义企图长期侵占台湾和制造“两个中国”的阴谋，定将遭到彻底的破产。
    王芸生等在发言中说，我们反对美帝国主义侵占台湾是世界人民反对美国侵略斗争的一部分，全世界爱好和平的人民都站在我们这一边。王芸生列举美帝国主义在世界各地到处碰壁的事实后说，美帝国主义现在是更加孤立了。委员们坚信，呆在台湾和台湾海峡的美国人，一定会在我国人民和世界人民面前滚回去的，如果赖着不走，它脖子上的绞索一定会越拉越紧，加速它的死亡。
    今天的集会由中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员楚图南主持。政协全国委员会副主席李济深出席了座谈会。
