    A Great Victory for the People of the World; Another Disgraceful Defeat for Imperialism
    All U.S. Troops Have Rolled Out of Lebanon
    Salam Says: No Matter How Small a Country Is, It Can Never Be Subdued by Force; The Will of the People Can Never Be Defeated by Aggressors
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th – Beirut dispatch: The last batch of American aggressor troops were forced to leave Lebanon on the 25th, ending the three-and-a-half-month military occupation of Lebanon by the United States.
    Six U.S. warships quietly left the port of Beirut that morning, carrying 1,500 American aggressor troops. At the same time, 190 paratroopers from the U.S. 24th Air Transport Division also took off from Beirut airport for West Germany.
    Adams, the commander of the U.S. invading forces in Lebanon, also left Lebanon by plane on the same day.
    However, it is reported that ten U.S. officers remain in Beirut, having changed into civilian clothes. It is said that they are staying behind to "settle the debts of those who supplied materials to the U.S. military."
    Commenting on the withdrawal of American troops, Lebanese Prime Minister Karami said that the American withdrawal is a victory for Lebanese independence and sovereignty, and a major step forward for stability in the Middle East. He also said,
  “Lebanon is no longer a base for conspiracies that could harm Arab countries. Since Lebanon has completely purged the old traces, I congratulate everyone.”
    Lebanese National Front leader Salam believes that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon shows that "no matter how small a country is, it cannot be subdued by the force used by large countries." He also said that another thing this incident proves is that the will of the people, even the will of the people of a small country, will not be defeated by aggressors.
    The "Beirut Evening News" hailed the forced withdrawal of the Anglo-American invading forces from Lebanon and Jordan as "a shameful retreat and defeat for imperialist robbers, and a victory for the Arab people."
    The newspaper pointed out, "The situation was the same when the Anglo-French robbers left Port Said in 1956."
    It pointed out that the Arab people now have a deep understanding of the true face and nature of U.S. imperialism. In the past, "when we talked about imperialists, we often did not include Americans." But now, "the American invading forces have left shameful, disgraceful, and dishonorable traces of aggression on the beaches and in the waves of Lebanon."

    世界人民的一个巨大胜利　帝国主义又一次可耻失败
    美军全部滚出了黎巴嫩
    萨拉姆说：国家多么小决不是武力所能压服，人民的意志决不是侵略者所能击败
    新华社大马士革26日电　贝鲁特消息：最后一批的美国侵略军在25日被迫离开黎巴嫩，从而结束了美国对黎巴嫩的三个半月的军事占领。
    六艘美国军舰在当天清晨载运了一千五百名美国侵略军悄悄地离开贝鲁特港口。同时，美国第二十四空运师的一百九十名伞兵也从贝鲁特机场起飞前往西德。
    侵黎美军司令亚当斯也在当天乘飞机离开黎巴嫩。
    但是据报道，还有十名美国军官留在贝鲁特，他们改穿平民服装。据说他们是留下“清偿向美军提供物资的人的债务”。
    黎巴嫩总理卡拉米在评论美国军队撤退一事说，美国撤军是黎巴嫩独立和主权的胜利，它使中东地区的稳定迈进了一大步。他又说，
  “黎巴嫩不再是可能损害阿拉伯国家的阴谋基地，由于黎巴嫩完全肃清了旧的痕迹，我向所有人祝贺。”
    黎巴嫩民族阵线领袖萨拉姆认为，美国军队撤出黎巴嫩一事表明，“一个国家不论多么小都不能被大国使用的武力所压服。”他又说，这件事情证明的另一点是，人民的意志、甚至是小国人民的意志，也不会被侵略者所击败。
    “贝鲁特晚报”欢呼美英侵略军队被迫撤出黎巴嫩和约旦是“帝国主义强盗可耻的撤退和失败，是阿拉伯人民的胜利”。
    这家报纸指出，“当1956年英法强盗离开塞得港的时候，情况也是一样。”
    它指出，阿拉伯人民现在已经深深地认识到美帝国主义的真面目和本质。在以前，“当我们谈到帝国主义者的时候，我们常常把美国人不列在里边”。而现在，“美国侵略军在黎巴嫩的海滩上、海浪中，都留下了可耻、丢脸和不光彩的侵略痕迹”。
