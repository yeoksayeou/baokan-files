Xinhua News Agency, October 18th: Ethnic minorities are fully capable of achieving the same great leap forward as the Han people, engaging in socialist construction at the highest speed, rapidly shedding the historical baggage of backwardness, and joining the ranks of advanced peoples. The National Ethnic Work On-site Observation Conference recently convened by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, powerfully illustrates this point.

This ethnic work on-site observation conference was convened under the following circumstances: more than 90% of the ethnic minority population across the country, under the leadership of the Party, have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Among them, some ethnic groups have crossed one or several social stages from feudalism, slavery, or even primitive social systems, implementing the socialist revolution and leaping into the socialist system. After the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, the class consciousness of ethnic minority laborers has greatly increased. Encouraged by the national great leap forward, the socialist construction endeavors in most ethnic minority areas have also initiated a great leap forward upsurge. Under these circumstances, the convening of this ethnic work on-site observation conference is of great significance.

More than one hundred representatives of ethnic workers from the central government and fourteen provinces and autonomous regions listened to the work report of the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County Committee of the Communist Party of China, studied the county's work experience, and also visited the Cheng Yang Brigade of the Satellite People's Commune in the county. The sky-high enthusiasm and high-speed great leap forward of the people of all ethnic groups greatly inspired the participating representatives.

Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County is located in a remote mountainous area at the junction of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan, inhabited by 180,000 people of the Dong, Miao, Han, Zhuang, and Yao ethnic groups. It has historically been a severely grain-deficient county, with an average grain yield of only a little over 100 jin per mu, requiring the import of large quantities of grain from Hunan and Guizhou every year. In 1954, land reform was completed through peaceful consultation. Although grain production increased year after year, production remained backward, and the serious grain shortage problem was not resolved. Since the second half of last year, the Sanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has led the people of all ethnic groups through the struggles of rectification, anti-rightist movement, and criticism of local nationalism, achieving a great victory in the struggle between the two roads. This year, it has also seriously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking in socialist construction, thoroughly eliminating the "backwardness theory" and "special theory" in ethnic minority areas. It overcame the right-leaning conservative thinking existing among cadres and the masses, such as "ethnic minority areas cannot compare with Han areas" and "mountainous areas cannot compare with plains." It put forward the resounding slogans of "admitting backwardness, changing backwardness," "catching up with Han areas, competing with plains," and "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, surpassing the advanced," setting off a mass production and construction upsurge. The vast number of cadres and people of all ethnic groups are full of confidence and soaring enthusiasm, breaking superstitions and reforming many customs and habits that are detrimental to socialism. The people of all ethnic groups have displayed the communist spirit of great unity and great collaboration, supporting each other, learning from each other, and competing with each other. A new socialist ethnic relationship is developing. This year, the county broke the old rules and bad habits of "high mountains and cold water, unable to plant two crops," reformed production technology, changed from single-season rice to double-season rice, and as a result, the average yield of early rice reached 1,021 jin per mu, leaping to become the first county in ethnic minority areas nationwide with an early rice yield of 1,000 jin. The grain output in the first half of the year alone exceeded the total grain output of the entire previous year, transforming it from a historically grain-deficient county into a surplus grain county. Now, the people of all ethnic groups in the county are full of confidence and are striving to achieve the goal of an average yield of 20,000 jin of grain per mu for the entire county this year. Simultaneously with the great leap forward in agriculture, more than 4,000 large and small factories have also been established in the industrial sector, an increase of more than 600 times compared with before the great leap forward.

The vivid scenes and rich experience of the great leap forward of the people of all ethnic groups in Sanjiang have greatly inspired the representatives from various places. At the on-site meeting, in addition to carefully studying the experience of Sanjiang, the representatives from various places also reported on the leap forward situation in their respective regions. Some representatives also talked about their understanding lagging behind reality, expressing that they would accelerate their pace in the future, engage in socialist construction at the highest speed in the nationwide great leap forward situation, just like the Han areas, and leap towards communism.

Xie Hechou, Deputy Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, made a concluding speech at the meeting. He affirmed the experience of the great leap forward in Sanjiang. He first pointed out that thoroughly carrying out the socialist revolution economically, politically, and ideologically among ethnic minorities, and thoroughly achieving victory in the struggle between the two roads, is an important guarantee for implementing the general line of socialist construction in ethnic minority areas. He said: "The theory of backwardness" and "the theory of specialness" are obstacles to the progress of ethnic minorities. Breaking the "theory of backwardness" and "the theory of specialness" is a fundamental issue related to the implementation of the general line in ethnic minority areas. This is a complex and arduous ideological struggle task in carrying out socialist construction in ethnic minority areas. He said that all ethnic minority areas should carry out socialist construction at a high speed. In this way, the time for ethnic minorities across the country to catch up with the level of the Han people will be greatly shortened. In his concluding remarks, he also pointed out that ethnic relations have undergone new developments on the basis of the socialist economy. The socialist great leap forward has presented new tasks to ethnic workers, which is to organize the great unity, great support, and great collaboration among all ethnic groups, promote the continuous development of socialist ethnic relations, and promote the great leap forward of socialist construction in ethnic minority areas.

    一步直登九重天
    少数民族跨越几个社会阶段飞跃前进
    统战部召开全国民族工作现场观摩会议
    介绍三江经验号召各民族大支援大协作
    据新华社18日讯　少数民族完全能够像汉族一样地大跃进，能以最高的速度来进行社会主义建设，迅速摆脱历史上遗留下来的落后状态，进入先进民族的行列。中共中央统战部最近在广西僮族自治区三江侗族自治县召开的全国民族工作现场观摩会议，有力地说明了这个问题。
    这次民族工作现场观摩会议，是在这样的形势下召开的：全国90％以上的少数民族人口，在党的领导下，已经取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利。其中有些民族从封建制度、奴隶制度，甚至原始社会制度，越过了一个或几个社会阶段，实行了社会主义革命，跃进到了社会主义制度。经过整风和社会主义教育运动以后，少数民族劳动人民的阶级觉悟大大提高，在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，绝大部分少数民族地区的社会主义建设事业同样掀起了大跃进高潮。在这样的形势下，这次民族工作现场观摩会议的召开，就有着很重要的意义。
    来自中央和全国十四个省、自治区的一百多民族工作者代表，听了中共三江侗族自治县委员会的工作情况介绍，研究了这个县的工作经验，还参观了这个县卫星人民公社侗族程阳大队。各族人民的冲天干劲和高速度大跃进的事实，给与会代表以很大的鼓舞。
    三江侗族自治县处在广西与贵州、湖南交界处的偏僻山区，居住着十八万侗族、苗族、汉族、僮族、瑶族人民，是历史上严重的缺粮县，平均亩产粮食只有一百多斤，每年要从湖南、贵州运进大批粮食。1954年通过和平协商的方式完成土地改革，粮食产量虽然连年增加，但生产仍然落后，严重缺粮问题并未解决。去年下半年以来，中共三江县委领导各族人民，经过整风、反右派、批判地方民族主义的斗争，取得了两条道路斗争的伟大胜利，今年又认真批判了社会主义建设上的右倾保守思想，彻底清除了少数民族地区的“落后论”、“特殊论”。克服了干部和群众中存在的“少数民族地区比不上汉族地区”、“山区比不上平原”等右倾保守思想。提出了“承认落后、改变落后”、“赶汉区、赛平原”、“学先进、赶先进、超先进”的响亮口号，掀起了群众性的生产建设高潮。广大干部和各族人民信心百倍，干劲冲天，破除迷信，改革了许多不利于社会主义的风俗习惯。各族人民发挥了大团结、大协作的共产主义精神，互相支援、互相学习、互相竞赛，新的社会主义民族关系正在发展。这个县今年打破“山高水冷、不能种二苗”的陈规陋习，改革生产技术，改一季稻为两季稻，结果早稻平均亩产达到了一千零二十一斤，一跃而为全国少数民族地区第一个早稻千斤县，仅上半年的粮食产量就超过去年一年的粮食总产量，由历来的缺粮县一变而为余粮县。现在全县各族人民正满怀信心，为实现今年全县平均亩产两万斤粮食的目标而努力。与农业大跃进的同时，工业方面也建立了大小工厂四千多个，比大跃进前增加了六百多倍。
    三江各族人民大跃进的生动情景和丰富经验，使各地代表受到很大的启发。在现场会议上，各地代表除仔细研究了三江的经验外，还汇报了本地区的跃进情况。有些代表还谈到他们的认识落后于实际，表示今后要加快步伐，在全国大跃进的形势下，和汉族地区一样，以最高的速度建设社会主义，并向共产主义跃进。
    中央民族事务委员会副主任谢鹤筹在会上作了总结发言。他肯定了三江大跃进的经验。他首先指出：在少数民族中彻底进行经济上、政治上和思想上的社会主义革命，彻底取得两条道路斗争的胜利，是在少数民族地区贯彻社会主义建设总路线的重要保证。他说：“落后论”、“特殊论”是少数民族前进的阻力，打破“落后论”、“特殊论”是关系到在少数民族地区贯彻总路线的根本问题，这是在少数民族地区进行社会主义建设中的一项复杂、艰巨的思想斗争任务。他说，各少数民族地区都应该以高速度来进行社会主义建设。这样，全国少数民族赶上汉族水平的时间将大大缩短。他在总结发言中，还指出民族关系在社会主义经济基础上得到了新的发展。社会主义大跃进，向民族工作者提出了新的任务，就是要组织各民族间的大团结、大支援、大协作，促进社会主义民族关系不断的发展，推动少数民族地区社会主义建设的大跃进。
