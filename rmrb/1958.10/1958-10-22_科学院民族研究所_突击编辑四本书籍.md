Academy of Sciences Institute of Ethnology
Rushes to Edit Four Books

    Recently, some researchers at the Institute of Ethnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, through intense labor, rushed to complete the editing of four books.

    "National Regional Autonomy" is a collection of documents and materials related to the policy and laws on national regional autonomy in our country, as well as information on local conditions. It contains more than 1.2 million words and is an important reference material for studying the issue of national regional autonomy in our country. "Historical Materials on Tibet" primarily selects materials from the "Qing Shilu" (Veritable Records of the Qing Dynasty), and also includes historical materials from the Guangxu reign transcribed from the Donghua Records, totaling about 1.7 million words. It is of great reference value for studying Tibetan history. "The Great Leap Forward in Ethnological Research" is divided into two parts: the first part collects reports by Comrades Wang Feng, Xie Fumin, Pan Zinian, and others at the inaugural meeting of the Institute of Ethnology and the scientific discussion meeting on ethnological research, as well as the Institute of Ethnology's Great Leap Forward plan. The second part is a selection of investigation reports by the National People's Congress Nationalities Committee's Social History Investigation Group on five ethnic groups: the Ewenki, the Kawa, the Yi, the Dai, and the Uyghur. "A Collection of Translations on Ethnic History" is a compilation of translated articles on the history of Chinese ethnic groups published in Soviet magazines. These four books will be published by publishing houses.
