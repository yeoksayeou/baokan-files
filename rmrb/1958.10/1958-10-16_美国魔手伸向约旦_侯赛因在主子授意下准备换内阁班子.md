　　The U.S. Sinister Hand Reaches into Jordan
　　Hussein, Under His Master's Instruction, Prepares to Change Cabinet

　　(Comprehensive Report) According to Xinhua News Agency: After Britain was forced to announce the withdrawal of its invading troops from Jordan, the United States sent an eight-member military delegation to the Jordanian capital Amman on the 14th, plotting to intervene and control the Jordanian army.
　　Jordan officially announced that this U.S. military delegation will conduct a "general investigation of the organization, administration, and equipment of the Jordanian army."
　　Personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Jordan said that this military delegation will hold talks with Jordanian officials "soon."
　　According to Western news agencies, King Hussein of Jordan is worried that after British troops are forced to withdraw from Jordan, he will be unable to control the domestic situation. Therefore, he has requested the United States to help him strengthen the morale of the Jordanian army and increase equipment to maintain his rule.
　　One day before the U.S. military delegation arrived, the U.S. Embassy announced another $7.5 million in "aid" to Hussein to help maintain his precarious little court.
　　According to statistics, the total amount of economic, technical, and budgetary "aid" given by the United States to Jordan from 1952 to 1958 has reached more than 100 million U.S. dollars. Military "aid" alone has reached 10 million U.S. dollars.
　　The U.S. military delegation is preparing to study the situation of the Jordanian army in order to provide American weapons "aid." The Jordanian army is mainly trained and equipped by Britain, but it is now equipped with American rifles, mortars, and tanks.
　　According to newspaper reports, since the successful Iraqi revolution on July 14, the Jordanian authorities have arrested 910 people in the country.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 13th (TASS): According to Amman news, a new cabinet may be formed in Jordan recently. From these reports, it can be seen that King Hussein wants to get rid of the current Rifai cabinet, hoping to prevent popular opposition and preserve his throne.
　　According to the "Victory" newspaper, King Hussein recently held a secret meeting with the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Jordanian Parliament, Khalifa, to discuss the draft of the King's speech.
　　The newspaper pointed out that this speech shifts the responsibility for the domestic situation and the breakdown of relations between the United Arab Republic and Jordan to the Rifai government. There are also reports that Hussein intends to change the cabinet at the behest of the United States and Britain, who believe that reorganizing the cabinet to some extent will stabilize Jordanian public opinion and extend the fate of the Hussein regime.

    美国魔手伸向约旦
    侯赛因在主子授意下准备换内阁班子
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在英国被迫宣布将从约旦撤出它的侵略军以后，美国在14日派了一个八人军事代表团赶到约旦首都安曼，阴谋插手控制约旦军队。
    约旦官方宣布，这个美国军事代表团将对“约旦陆军的组织、行政和配备情况进行一次总的调查”。
    美国驻约旦大使馆的人士说，这个军事代表团“很快”将同约旦官员举行会谈。
    据西方通讯社消息说，约旦国王侯赛因担心在英国军队被迫撤出约旦后，他就无法控制国内局势，因此他要求美国帮助他加强约旦军队士气，增加装备，以维持他的统治。
    在美国军事代表团到达之前一天，美国大使馆宣布又给侯赛因七百五十万美元的“援助”，来帮助维持他那风雨飘摇的小朝廷。
    据统计，美国给予约旦的经济、技术和预算方面的“援助”从1952年到1958年总共已达一亿美元以上。仅是军事“援助”方面已达一千万美元。
    美国军事代表团准备研究约旦军队的情况以便提供美国武器的“援助”。约旦军队主要是由英国训练和装备的，但是现在已经装备了美国的步枪、迫击炮和坦克。
    据报纸消息，自从7月14日伊拉克革命成功以来，约旦当局已经在国内逮捕了九百一十人。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社大马士革13日讯：据安曼消息，最近约旦可能组成新内阁。从这些消息中可以看出，国王侯赛因想摆脱里法伊现内阁，指望以此来防止人民的反对和保住自己的王位。
    据“胜利报”报道，最近国王侯赛因同约旦议会众议院议长哈利法举行秘密会议，会议讨论了国王演说草稿。
    报纸指出，这篇演说把国内局势以及阿拉伯联合共和国同约旦关系破裂的责任推到里法伊政府头上。还有消息说，侯赛因打算更换内阁是出于美英两国的授意，美英两国认为，在某种程度上改组内阁会安定约旦民心，并可延长侯赛因政权的命运。
