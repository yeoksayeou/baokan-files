Xinhua News Agency dispatch: China's first two-thousand horsepower marine diesel engine was recently manufactured and completed at the Shanghai Ship Repair and Building Factory. It is a main engine for 3,000-ton coastal freighters and Type B coastal passenger-cargo ships. This is a major achievement in China's shipbuilding history, paving the way for China to manufacture new types of ships and larger diesel engines in the future. Previously, the largest domestically made diesel engine in China was only nine hundred and thirty horsepower.

This medium-sized marine diesel engine was primarily designed by the Fourth Product Design Office of the Shipbuilding Product Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building. In the design process, it received assistance from the Hudong Shipyard and Jiaotong University, among other units.
