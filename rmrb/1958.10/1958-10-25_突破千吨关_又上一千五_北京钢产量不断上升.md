Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd – After Beijing’s daily steel production broke through the 1,000-ton mark on the 1st, it has been steadily advancing above 1,000 tons. On the 22nd, it even reached 1,586 tons.

In the first half of October, Beijing's average daily steel production was only 500 tons, far from completing the annual production plan. To ensure the early and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production target, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to accelerate the construction projects of the "Three Steels" (Beijing Steel Plant, Beijing Special Steel Plant, and the small steel plants of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company) while launching a mass movement for indigenous steelmaking methods throughout the city.

This movement developed extremely rapidly. More than six thousand small converters, open hearth furnaces, and crucible furnaces were quickly established in government offices, factories, schools, shops, streets, and rural communes. At Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other institutions of higher learning, furnaces sprang up everywhere, with teachers and students making steel together. Renmin University built more than 140 steelmaking furnaces on the campus open spaces and sports fields, with more than 2,000 teachers, students, staff, and family members participating in steelmaking. Cadres and workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company built groups of indigenous steelmaking furnaces next to the blast furnaces and steel converters. They decided that everyone in the company should use indigenous furnaces to produce two tons of steel for the country by the end of the year. The vast number of staff members of central government agencies and officers and soldiers of troops stationed in Beijing also participated in steelmaking. Ministers and generals frequently appeared at the steelmaking furnaces. A steelmaking army of more than 100,000 people from all walks of life in the city are fighting bravely for steel.

Once the mass movement of indigenous steelmaking methods was launched, it immediately demonstrated its power. The people of each district produced 140 tons of steel on the 18th, and by the 22nd, it had reached 591 tons. On that day, the daily output of Chaoyang District alone rose to 165 tons, surpassing the daily output of Beijing Special Steel Plant and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company's small steel plants on the same day.

    突破千吨关　又上一千五
    北京钢产量不断上升
    新华社23日讯　北京市钢的日产量从1日起突破千吨大关之后，一直在千吨以上稳步向前跃进；22日更达到了一千五百八十六吨。
    北京市在10月上半月钢的平均日产量只有五百吨，离完成全年生产计划还相差很远。为了确保今年钢的生产任务提前超额完成，中共北京市委决定在加速北京钢厂、北京特殊钢厂和石景山钢铁公司的小炼钢厂等“三钢”建设工程的同时，要在全市开展群众性的土法炼钢运动。
    这一运动发展极为迅速。六千多个小转炉、炒钢炉、坩埚炉很快就在机关、工厂、学校、商店、街道和农村公社中建立起来。在北京大学、清华大学和其他高等学校里，群炉四起，教师和学生在一起炼钢。人民大学在校园的空地上、运动场上建起了一百四十多个炼钢炉，全校在校师生员工和家属小孩共两千多人参加炼钢。石景山钢铁公司的干部和工人，在炼钢铁的高炉和炼钢的转炉旁，建起了一群群的土炼钢炉，他们决定全公司每个人到年底要用土炉子为国家炼出两吨钢。中央国家机关的广大工作人员和驻京部队的官兵，也参加了炼钢，部长和将军们，经常出现在炼钢炉旁。全城文武百行十多万人的炼钢大军，正在奋勇地为钢而战。
    群众性的土法炼钢运动一经开展起来，立即显示出它的威力。各区人民在18日炼钢一百四十吨，到22日就达到五百九十一吨。这一天光朝阳区的日产量就上升到一百六十五吨，赶过了北京特殊钢厂和石景山钢铁公司小炼钢厂当天的日产量。
