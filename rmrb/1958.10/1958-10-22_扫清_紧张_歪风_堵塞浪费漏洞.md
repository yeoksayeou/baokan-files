    Sweep Away the "Tension" Evil Wind
    Block Loopholes of Waste
    (Our Dispatch) Yongfeng People's Commune in Jiuquan County, Gansu Province, taking production as the key, used the methods of great airing of views, great contending, and great debate to thoroughly break down right-leaning conservative thinking, and took emergency measures to solve the problem of labor shortage, ensuring the double leap forward of production and construction and commune construction.
    The Yongfeng People's Commune was established on September 20 this year by merging ten agricultural cooperatives from the original Yin'da, Yanghong, and Huaimao townships. Because the commune was newly established, and production and construction and commune construction and other tasks had to advance simultaneously, there was a phenomenon of labor shortage and cadres being overwhelmed. In this situation, some people began to shout: "All the strong and able-bodied labor has gone to support the steel industry, leaving only women, children, old men, and patients in the commune. There's no one for agriculture," "There is a shortage of labor, the tasks are too heavy, and we can't finish them no matter what we do." The commune party committee believes that this is the rise of right-leaning conservative thinking on the current agricultural front, and this stumbling block must be removed to ensure the current central tasks of accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing, and to ensure a greater leap forward.
    The commune first conducted an investigation and study of the labor force usage in the whole commune, and found that there was a great deal of waste. The whole commune has a total of seven thousand five hundred and fifty-three male and female laborers, of which one thousand one hundred were transferred to support the steel industry, and six thousand four hundred and fifty-three remained in the commune. Due to poor organization and allocation, only four thousand one hundred and sixteen of these people actually participated in agricultural production. The remaining personnel included five hundred and ninety-seven people working as cooks and administrators in the collective canteens, while raising pigs, raising fish, managing gardens, and raising livestock accounted for three hundred and fifty-seven people, and accounting personnel and other management cadres of the commune accounted for sixty-two people. Among these people, many are strong laborers with good labor skills.
    Based on this situation, the second step of the commune was to actively improve organization and management, and formulate a labor arrangement plan to tap labor resources from the following aspects:
  (1) Merge factories. Concentrate and merge the five hundred and nineteen factories scattered in the original ten agricultural cooperatives according to their nature to reduce administrative management personnel.
  (2) Streamline accounting and canteen management personnel. Because the commune implemented the distribution method of supply system plus low wage system, all one hundred and seventeen work point recorders in the commune can also be eliminated and immediately organized to put into production. According to the size and sex of livestock, separate feeding and management can save one hundred feeders and herders. (3) Vigorously engage in experimental fields. Organize leaders and management cadres at all levels of the commune, cadres of commercial, cultural and health departments within the commune, and use the method of each person contracting to cultivate one mu of experimental field, which can contract out a total of eight hundred and eighty-six mu, accounting for 11.23% of the land in the commune that has not yet been deeply plowed. (4) Under the principle of diligence and thrift in running the commune, vigorously run nurseries and kindergartens to thoroughly liberate women's labor force.
    The third step was to organize the cadres of the entire commune to have a great airing of views, great contending, and great debate, and to criticize right-leaning conservative thinking through discussion of the labor arrangement plan. After this series of work, the evil wind of shouting about labor shortage and not actively leading production has been beaten back. Agricultural production and various infrastructure construction projects in the whole commune have been rapidly launched. The autumn harvest work has basically ended, shortening the time greatly compared with last year. People are throwing themselves into the upsurge of accumulating fertilizer and deep plowing, guaranteeing 10,000 catties of fertilizer per person. The hydropower station and greenhouse construction projects and the residential buildings in the commune's residential areas, which had been delayed for a long time, are also under intense construction.

    扫清“紧张”歪风
    堵塞浪费漏洞
    本报讯　甘肃省酒泉县永丰人民公社以生产为纲，用大鸣大放大辩论的方法，大破右倾保守思想，并采取紧急措施解决劳动力紧张问题，保证了生产建设和公社建设的双跃进。
    永丰人民公社是在今年9月20日，由原银达、杨洪、怀茂等三个乡的十个农业社合并成立的。由于公社刚刚建立，生产建设、公社建设等各项工作又要齐头并进，这样就呈现了劳动力紧张、干部手忙脚乱的现象。在这种情况下，有些人开始喊叫：“青壮年好劳力都支援钢铁工业去了，社内只剩下妇女、娃娃、老汉、病人，农业上没有人了”，“劳动力不足，任务太繁重，咋干也干不完。”公社党委认为：这是目前农业战线上右倾保守思想的抬头，必须搬掉这块绊脚石，才能保证当前积肥、深翻地等项中心工作的进行，才能保证更大跃进。
    公社首先对全社劳动力使用情况作了调查研究，发现浪费现象很大。全社共有男女劳动力七千五百五十三人，外调支援钢铁工业的共一千一百人，还有六千四百五十三人留在社内。这些人由于组织调配不善，实际参加农业生产的只有四千一百一十六人。其余人员有五百九十七人在集体食堂内当炊事员、管理员，养猪、养鱼、管理园艺和饲养牲口的就占去三百五十七人，财会人员和公社其他管理干部就占去六十二人。这些人中，很多人都是劳动力强、劳动技术好的人。
    根据这种情况，公社第二步即积极改善组织管理，制订劳力安排方案，从下列一些方面挖掘劳动力：
  （1）合并工厂。把分散在原十个农业社的五百一十九个工厂，按性质集中合并，减少行政管理人员。
  （2）精简财会、食堂管理人员。由于公社实行了供给制加低工资制的分配办法，全社的一百一十七名记工员也可全部省掉，立即组织投入生产。又根据牲畜大小、公母，进行分场饲养管理，可省出饲养员、放牧员一百人。（3）大搞试验田。组织公社各级领导管理干部，公社内的商业、文化卫生等部门的干部，用每人包干种一亩试验田的办法，共可包掉八百八十六亩，占全社尚未深翻土地的11.23％。（4）在勤俭办社原则下，大办托儿所、幼儿园，彻底解放妇女劳动力。
    第三步，组织全社干部大鸣大放大辩论，通过讨论劳力安排方案，批判右倾保守思想。经过这一系列的工作以后，喊叫劳力紧张不积极领导生产的歪风已被打回去。全社的农业生产和各项基建工作均迅速展开。秋收工作已基本结束，比去年大大缩短了时间。人们正投入积肥、深翻地的热潮中，每人保证积肥万斤。过去迟迟没动工的水力发电站和温室基建工作和公社居民点的住宅也在紧张建设。　（姚秉鉴）
