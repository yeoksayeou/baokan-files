Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: The development of draught cattle in Hunan Province has been rapid this year. By mid-September, more than 845,000 cows in the province had been inseminated and conceived or had given birth, accounting for 85% of the total number of cows capable of breeding, basically achieving the goal of making Hunan a "province full of pregnant cows." According to statistics up to the end of August, a total of 237,639 calves were born in the province. Adding this to the number of draught cattle at the end of last year and subtracting the number slaughtered and died this year, the province's stock of draught cattle is more than 3.21 million head, a net increase of 5.2% compared with the end of last year, greatly exceeding the average annual net increase of 2.6% during the First Five-Year Plan period.

One of the reasons for the high rate of draught cattle reproduction in Hunan Province this year is: putting politics in command, mobilizing the whole Party, mobilizing the whole people, and doing a good job in draught cattle breeding and insemination, repeatedly criticizing the negative thinking of "waiting for tractors, waiting for mechanized farming without using cattle." Jiang Zhenhua, Deputy Commissioner of the Hengyang Special District, personally led a bull to inseminate four cows in the Shengli Cooperative of Hengnan County, changing the mistaken perception of some cadres and masses that leading cattle for insemination was a shameful thing.

The second reason is: through the rectification movement, the minds of the broad masses and cadres have been liberated, and they have broken through all superstitious and conservative barriers. In the past, it was believed that draught cattle could only be inseminated in spring and autumn, but this year, the method of using estrus-inducing insemination and inseminating as soon as estrus occurs has been widely adopted in various places, with good results. The masses in various places have created 2,619 kinds of indigenous prescriptions for inducing estrus and protecting the fetus, promoted more than 3.06 million jin of indigenous medicine, and more than 10,000 veterinarians have been engaged in insemination and reproduction work. The long-standing conclusion that "buffaloes give birth every two years" has also been overturned by the masses. In Matang Cooperative, Yueyang County, 87 cows were all buffaloes, and they have given birth every year since 1956, with each calf surviving and growing strong. The number of draught cattle in this cooperative has more than doubled in two years.

The third reason is: all localities have paid attention to the nursing of calves, basically achieving the goal of having each calf born survive. At present, the people's communes throughout the province have established 4,297 calf pastures, and more than 70,000 calves are living in these pastures, which are called "calf nurseries" by the masses, and are growing very quickly.

### 湖南是“母牛满怀”省

    湖南是“母牛满怀”省
    新华社长沙电　湖南省农村耕牛今年发展很快，到9月中旬止，全省配种受胎和产仔的母牛有八十四万五千多头，占能繁殖的母牛总数的85％，基本上实现了“母牛满怀省”。根据到8月底止的统计，全省一共产下小牛二十三万七千六百三十九头，加上去年年底存栏耕牛和除去今年屠宰、死亡的数字，全省存栏耕牛有三百二十一万多头，比去年年底存栏头净增5.2％，大大超过第一个五年计划期间平均每年净增2.6％的增殖速度。
    今年湖南省耕牛增殖速度高的原因之一是：政治挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，做好耕牛繁殖配种工作，反复批判了“坐等拖拉机，坐等机耕不用牛”的消极思想。衡阳专区副专员姜振华在衡南县胜利社亲自牵公牛配种四头母牛，改变了一些干部和群众认为牵牛配种是件丢人丑事的错误看法。
    原因之二是：通过整风运动，广大群众和干部思想解放了，他们冲破了一切迷信保守关。过去认为耕牛只有春、秋两季才能配种，而今年各地普遍采用催情配种、随发情随配种的办法，收效很好。各地群众创造的催情、保胎等土药方有二千六百一十九种，推广了三百零六万多斤土药，有一万多名兽医投入了配种繁殖工作。过去长期流行的“水牛两年一胎”的定论也被群众推翻了。岳阳县麻塘社有八十七头母牛都是水牛，从1956年来年年一胎，头头成活、壮健。这个社的耕牛两年增加一倍多。
    原因之三是：各地都注意了小牛的养护工作，基本上做到生一头成活一头。目前，全省人民公社已经建立起四千二百九十七个小牛牧场，有七万多头小牛在这种被群众叫做“小牛托儿所”的牧场里生活着，成长得很快。
