Xinhua News Agency, October 13th: The relevant departments of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Communications have recently jointly studied the problem of irrational coal transportation flows. According to the results of the study, the irrational transportation of 1.08 million tons of coal will be adjusted in the fourth quarter of this year. A total of 1.17 billion ton-kilometers of railway transportation capacity can be saved, which is equivalent to adding nearly 10,000 railcars.

According to this joint study, the focus has been on adjusting thirteen coal flow directions in the Northeast and southern provinces, as well as along the major railway trunk lines of Jinpu, Jingguang, and Longhai. For example, the coal originally scheduled to be transported from Heilongjiang to Beijing, and then via the Jingbao line to Baotou and the Longyan Iron Mine, will now only be transported to Chengde outside Shanhaiguan, replacing the Kailuan coal that was originally planned to be transported north via the Jingjin line. The coal required by Baotou and the Longyan Iron Mine will be supplied from nearby Shanxi Province. After this adjustment, not only will the transportation distance of these three coal flows be shortened, reducing the countercurrent phenomenon, but also the transportation burden on the Fengsha and Jingbao railway lines, which have the weakest traffic capacity, will be greatly reduced. This item alone saves the railway department over 800 million ton-kilometers of transportation capacity.

In the process of adjusting coal transportation flows, the Ministry of Communications also played an active role in cooperation, improving the coastal and inland waterway transport capacity. Starting in October, the amount of coal shipped from Dalian Port and Qinhuangdao will increase from the original hundreds of thousands of tons to more than 1.6 million tons. In this way, one-third of the coal that originally needed to be transported from the Jinpu Railway to the south can be shared by waterways.

### 不让煤炭对流倒运  煤炭、铁道、交通等部调整煤炭运输流向

    不让煤炭对流倒运
    煤炭、铁道、交通等部调整煤炭运输流向
    据新华社13日讯　煤炭工业部、铁道部和交通部等有关部门最近共同研究了改变煤炭运输不合理流向的问题。根据研究结果，今年第四季度将有一百零八万吨煤炭的不合理运输现象得到调整，共计可以节约铁路运输力十一亿七千万吨公里，等于增加了将近一万个车皮。
    根据这次的共同研究，着重调整了东北与南方各省以及津浦、京广、陇海等主要铁路干线的十三宗煤炭流向。例如把原定从黑龙江运到北京，再经京包线运到包头和龙烟铁矿的煤，现在只运到山海关外的承德，代替本来准备经京锦线北运的开滦煤；包头和龙烟铁矿所需的煤，则从附近的山西省运来供应。经过这样调整以后，不但缩短了这三宗煤炭运输里程，减少了对流现象，还大大减轻了通车能力最薄弱的丰沙和京包两铁路线的运输负担。仅这一项计算，就为铁路部门节约了八亿多吨公里的运输力。
    在调整煤炭运输流向的过程中，交通部也发挥了主动协作的精神，提高了沿海和内河的水运能力。从10月份起，由大连港和秦皇岛启运的煤炭，将从原来的几十万吨提高到一百六十多万吨。这样，本来需要从津浦铁路运往南方的煤炭，就有三分之一可以用水路来分担了。
