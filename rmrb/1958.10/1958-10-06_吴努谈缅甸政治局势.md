Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu delivered a lengthy speech to students at Rangoon University on the evening of the 2nd, calling on the people to believe that he is a "person who has never done anything detrimental to the country and the people," and denying claims that his decision to transfer power was due to cowardice.

U Nu revealed that before the transfer of power, the military had taken military measures in Rangoon and other places because a rumor circulated in the army that the (Clean) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League would form an alliance with the National United Front and the Communists; the army suspected that the (Clean) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League government was making concessions to underground parties on the issue of domestic peace; at the end of August, some county-level meetings of the (Clean) Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League made some strong remarks against certain military personnel, which further fueled the serious suspicion that already existed in the army. He said that he only learned about this situation three or four hours after arriving in Rangoon on September 22. After he summoned some military officers to understand the situation, he came to the conclusion that if a general election were held under the current conditions of the country, it would produce more bloodshed, the situation would be difficult to control, and foreign intervention would occur. Considering the above consequences, he decided to invite General Ne Win to serve as Prime Minister and prepare conditions for free and fair elections.

    吴努谈缅甸政治局势
    据新华社讯　缅甸总理吴努2日晚向仰光大学学生发表长篇演说，呼吁人民相信他是一个“从未做过任何不利于国家与人民的事情的人”，并否认他决定移交政权是由于胆小的说法。
    吴努透露，在移交政权之前，军队在仰光和其他各地曾经采取了军事措施，因为在军队中流传一种谣言，说（纯洁的）反法西斯人民自由同盟将同民族团结阵线和共产党人结成联盟；军队怀疑（纯洁的）反法西斯人民自由同盟政府在国内和平问题上向地下党派作让步；在8月底，（纯洁的）反法西斯人民自由同盟的某些县级会议发表了一些反对某些军队人员的强硬的言论，这进一步促进了军队中间原来已经存在的严重怀疑。他说，他是在9月22日到达仰光三四个小时以后才知道这种情况的。在他召集某些军官了解情况以后，他得出了一个结论：如果在国家目前的条件下举行大选，那将会产生更多的流血，而且局势将难以控制，并将发生外国干涉。考虑到上述后果，他决定邀请奈温将军担任总理职务，并且为举行自由和公正的大选准备条件。
