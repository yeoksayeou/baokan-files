Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 27th. TASS Moscow reported: Young men and women in both urban and rural areas of the Soviet Union are enthusiastically celebrating their holiday – the 40th anniversary of the founding of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) with joy and excitement. In the days leading up to and celebrating the holiday, Soviet youth reviewed the path they have traveled, are proud of the labor achievements they have made in the construction of the motherland, and once again solemnly assured the Party: to be forever loyal to the cause of communism, to be forever faithful children of the Communist Party, and to dedicate their lives to the struggle to build communism.

On October 26, a grand rally was held in Red Square in Moscow by 25,000 young men and women representatives to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Komsomol. Soviet Party and government leaders such as Khrushchev and Voroshilov, as well as leaders of the Komsomol Central Committee, attended the meeting.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, Semichastny, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Soviet Komsomol has gloriously held high the banner of Lenin throughout its entire history, wholeheartedly helping the Party to train Leninists, to train active and enthusiastic fighters for the victory of the great communist ideals, and to sacredly maintain loyalty to the cause of the Party. He spoke about the labor achievements of the Komsomol members for the motherland. He said that in just six months since the 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, Komsomol members have built six new blast furnaces, two open-hearth furnaces, and three coke ovens for the country, constructed hundreds of kilometers of new railways, raised billions of rubles in Komsomol savings, and harvested hundreds of millions of poods of grain in reclamation areas.

Finally, the congress passed a letter of greetings to the Central Committee of the CPSU. The letter of greetings said that we will always treat labor with a communist attitude, we will economize in all aspects, master knowledge, and remember Lenin's admonition: only a truly educated person can become a true builder of communism.

In recent days, clubs, museums, and schools in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities and villages in the Soviet Union have held various forms and contents of evening parties, meetings with veteran Komsomol members, report meetings, etc., to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Komsomol. Young men and women in Moscow and Leningrad held many meetings with those who participated in the Komsomol in the earliest days. In a meeting held in Leningrad, Colonel Yakovlev, a staff member of the Central Naval Museum, introduced to the young people the relics preserved in the museum that illustrate the glorious history of the Leninist Komsomol. These relics brought the young people's memories back to the years of the domestic war and the Patriotic War, the touching years when the older generation of Komsomol members struggled hard and established great feats to defend and consolidate the Soviet regime.

On October 26, youths in Minsk, the capital of the Byelorussian Republic, and Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, held celebratory parades. (Attached picture)

    苏联青年欢庆建团四十周年
    二万五千名男女青年代表在红场举行盛大集会
    新华社莫斯科27日电　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国各地城乡男女青年以欢欣鼓舞的心情热烈庆祝自己的节日——苏联列宁共产主义青年团建立四十周年。在迎接和庆祝节日的日子里，苏联青年们回顾了他们过去走过的道路，为自己在祖国建设中所建树的劳动功勋而自豪，并且再次向党庄严地保证：永远忠于共产主义事业，永远做共产党的忠实儿女，把自己的一生献给争取建成共产主义的斗争。
    10月26日，莫斯科的二万五千名男女青年代表在红场举行了盛大集会，纪念共青团成立四十周年。赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫等苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人以及共青团中央的领导人参加了大会。
    全苏列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记谢米恰斯内伊在大会上讲了话。他说，苏联共青团在它的全部历史中光荣地高举着列宁的旗帜，全心全意地帮助党培养列宁主义者，培养为伟大的共产主义理想的胜利而斗争的积极热情的战士，神圣地保持着对党的事业的忠诚。他谈到了共青团员为祖国建树的劳动功绩。他说，仅仅在全苏列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会以后的六个月中，共青团员们就为国家建成了六座新高炉、两座平炉和三座炼焦炉，修建了数百公里的新铁路，募集了数十亿卢布的共青团储蓄金，在开垦地区收获了数亿普特的粮食。
    最后，大会通过了给苏共中央的致敬信。致敬信说，我们将永远以共产主义态度对待劳动，我们将在各方面节约，掌握知识，记住列宁的遗训：只有真正有教养的人，才能成为真正的共产主义建设者。
    这几天来，莫斯科、列宁格勒和苏联其他城市和农村的俱乐部、博物馆和学校纷纷举行各种形式和内容的晚会、同老共青团员的会见会、报告会等，来庆祝苏联共青团建立四十周年。莫斯科和列宁格勒的男女青年同那些最早参加共青团的人举行了很多次的会见。在列宁格勒举行的一次会见中，中央海军博物馆工作人员雅科夫列夫上校向青年们介绍了博物馆中所保留的说明列宁共青团的光荣历史的遗物。这些遗物把青年们的回忆带到了国内战争和卫国战争期间、老一代共青团员为保卫和巩固苏维埃政权而艰苦斗争和建立丰功伟绩的那些可歌可泣的年代里。
