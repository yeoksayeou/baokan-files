Labor Problems and Ideological Problems

Why Can Xiajiang County, Where Labor is Severely Scarce, Achieve High-Speed Development in Grain and Iron Production?

By our reporter Ling Jianhua

Labor Shortage, Economic Backwardness, Rapid Progress

Xiajiang County, Jiangxi Province, has a small population, abundant land, and a lack of water resources. The county currently has a population of 64,000, including an agricultural population of 59,000, with over 410,000 mu of dry and paddy fields, including 385,000 mu of paddy fields. There are more than 13,000 male laborers, averaging 30 mu of cultivated land per person. Before liberation, women here did not participate in field labor. In recent years, some women have begun to participate in field labor, but generally, they do some auxiliary labor, and not many participate in transplanting and harvesting rice, and even fewer know how to harrow and plow the fields. Because of the small population and abundant land, and the severe labor shortage, most of the fields are only planted with one season of middle rice or late rice, and the cultivation is very rough. The average yield per mu for the whole year is generally only over 100 jin. The yields in 1955 and 1957 were relatively high, but the yield per mu was only about 210 jin, and the total output was only over 75 million jin.

Xiajiang County's industrial base had nothing except a small power plant. Some ironworkers, carpenters, and masons came from other counties, only a few of whom worked here year-round, and the rest were temporary workers who came to do odd jobs and then went back. Not a single ironworker, carpenter, or mason was from this county. For transportation, except for a highway from Nanchang to Ganzhou that passes through Xiajiang, there are no other roads in the county.

In such an area with a severe labor shortage and a very backward economic base, can we rely on our own labor force to develop agriculture at high speed? In particular, can we develop industry at high speed while developing agriculture at high speed, and implement the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture? The practice of Xiajiang County has given an affirmative answer to this question.

The development of agricultural production in this county this year is at high speed. This year, they resolutely implemented measures such as changing one season to two seasons, universal close planting, and increasing fertilizer application. As a result, the total output of more than 360,000 mu of early rice reached more than 120 million jin, with an average yield of more than 300 jin per mu. The harvest of one season of early rice exceeded the total grain output of the whole year last year by more than 60%. Calculated by agricultural population, each person already has 2,100 jin of grain; calculated by the total urban and rural population of the county, each person also has nearly 2,000 jin of grain. The people here are striving to make late rice surpass early rice, and strive for each person to have 4,000 to 5,000 jin of grain a year. Now, late rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops are threatened by drought, but if there are no more major disasters, it is possible to achieve the target of 4,000 to 5,000 jin of grain per person. Even calculated at 4,000 jin per person, it is more than three times last year. The annual grain output far exceeds the total grain output of the past three years, and one year of planting can feed the population for four or five years. Isn't this development speed high speed?

The industry in this county is also developing at high speed this year. They organized several ironworkers (from other counties, who work here year-round), transferred dozens of farmers to be apprentices, and transferred a technician and a broken-down small lathe from the power plant, and established a Xiajiang Machinery Factory. Nearly 100 kilometers of highways and hundreds of kilometers of township and commune roads have been built. A high tide of large-scale iron smelting industry has been set off. A 14-cubic-meter blast furnace has been put into production, and 20 of the 42 0.5-cubic-meter earthen furnaces are in normal production. Twenty-four small coal mines have mined more than 300 tons of coal after being built and have begun to produce coke. A thousand workers are regularly engaged in iron smelting production. Recently, the county has transferred a large number of laborers to build two blast furnace groups for iron smelting, each consisting of dozens of blast furnaces; building furnaces and producing simultaneously, striving to produce 30,000 to 50,000 tons of iron and 300,000 tons of coal by the end of the year. If calculated at 30,000 tons of iron, the county will have an average of 1,000 jin of iron per person in just a few months. Isn't this development speed high speed?

First Calculate the Labor Account or First Calculate the Ideological Account

Since Xiajiang County has such a severe labor shortage, why is the development speed of industry and agriculture so fast? What is the most basic experience in their work?

1. In the past, whenever we talked about doing something, we always had to calculate a labor account first. In fact, the labor account can be calculated, but it can also not be calculated. Of course, we can calculate how many people there are in the county, but how much of the labor force is wasted in the use of labor? How much can a person's labor efficiency be improved? How many people did not participate in labor or did not participate in major labor in the past, and what is their labor potential? These accounts are often not able to be calculated. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas always calculate the labor account according to the old rules, and cannot see or believe that the masses have great labor potential. As a result, once the account is calculated, it is "no labor force." Before last winter, the Xiajiang County Party Committee had also been calculating the account in this way, so it had been troubled by "no labor force." At that time, the annual task was to strive to plant crops on the cultivated land, as far as possible not to abandon the fields, and dared not think or do anything else. By last winter, when a mass rectification campaign came to the countryside, with great debates and big-character posters, the situation began to change greatly. As soon as the enthusiasm of the masses rose, there was immediately a high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and the scale and speed far exceeded the original expectations. From then on, the County Party Committee understood a truth: in the past, on the one hand, there was a severe labor shortage, and on the other hand, there was a waste of labor; there were few people and little labor, but one person could top two or three... From then on, whenever someone was still calculating the labor account according to the old rules, the County Party Committee insisted on another new calculation method, that is: how many laborers can one laborer top? How many semi-laborers can top full laborers? How many people who were not considered laborers (did not participate in labor) can be counted as laborers (participated in labor)? In this way, some people who shouted "no labor force" had nothing to say. This is an experience.

2. However, relying on this new calculation method does not completely solve ideological problems, and there are still many accounts that cannot be specifically calculated. Therefore, Xiajiang County has another experience, which is to debate whether to do something, why to do it, and whether it is okay not to do it? Do not fall into the small circle of calculating the labor account first. For things that must be done and must be done, we must advance in the face of difficulties and be determined to start. Once "forced," coupled with trusting and relying on the masses, a solution will come out. This spring, the County Party Committee decided to change middle rice to early rice, one season to two seasons, and also to universally plant closely (increasing from 4,500 seedlings per mu in the past to 9,000 seedlings, and a few reaching 10,000 to 20,000 seedlings), and increase fertilizer application (increasing from dozens of loads of fertilizer per mu in the past to 200 to 300 loads). If the labor account is calculated according to the old rules, it will increase by at least four or five times compared to the past. In the end, how much labor potential could be tapped was not clear at the beginning. As a result, in the practice of working hard, many methods came out, and many difficulties were solved. In the past, only more than 170,000 mu of middle rice (4,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu) in the county also dragged on for a month or so to harvest, but this year, more than 360,000 mu of early rice (9,000 seedlings per mu) was harvested in half a month. Some townships that worked quickly only spent seven or eight days.

When the large-scale iron smelting industry started in the second half of this year, although it encountered the "big hurdle" of labor force again, they seized the time before the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting to build the first batch of forty-eight furnaces. During the busy season of "doubleÊê∂" (rush harvesting and rush planting), they also ensured that about half of the furnaces were in normal production. Now they are freeing up a large amount of labor and transferring it to the iron and steel front.

3. Great debates, big-character posters, and large-scale mass movements are another experience of Xiajiang County in organizing the labor force. Since last winter, there has been one movement after another, and one shock after another, which is indeed very tense. However, cadres and the masses recognize the significance of this tension. For example, because there are few people and abundant land here, people's desire to have tractors and water pumps, and to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture is particularly urgent. When conducting a great debate on large-scale iron smelting industry, after understanding that there is no mechanization without steel, and it is impossible to fundamentally get rid of the labor shortage, everyone's enthusiasm for running steel greatly increased, and they were happy to be more tense at present. In this way, in the unfavorable factor of few people and abundant land for large-scale iron smelting industry, there also emerged favorable factors to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the masses and tap the labor potential to run the large-scale iron smelting industry.

In various movements, they skillfully used the methods of big-character posters and great debates to solve fundamental problems. Recently, at the construction site of the two newly built eight-cubic-meter blast furnaces, once the debate and appraisal were grasped, the labor efficiency greatly improved, and the transportation team increased from completing nine trips a day (the distance is about one and a half li) to fourteen trips and eighteen trips, and the load capacity of each trip also doubled. From here, everyone understood a truth: whether the labor efficiency is high or not, the most fundamental thing is still the ideological problem.

Now, Xiajiang County has gradually formed some new labor systems. Such as the militarization of labor organization, part-time work and part-time farming, the combination of education and labor, cadres participating in labor, and organizing labor cooperation, etc. The universal promotion and regular adherence to these systems enable all men, women, old and young, workers, farmers, merchants, and students in the county to exert their labor potential. Some children who have not yet been able to participate in labor have also formed field cheerleading squads to boost morale. Deng Maochang, the vice county magistrate of Xiajiang County, who is over fifty years old, is an old comrade who participated in the Soviet revolution here, and is still a labor expert. In rush harvesting and rush planting, he ran to the mountainous areas and worked in the fields, and could work two or three mu a day. Liu Chunhe, the director of the County Metallurgical Bureau, is a leading cadre, technical personnel, and ordinary worker at the furnace construction site. The responsible comrades in the county are often either in the fields or on the construction site, and rarely live in the organs. In the busy farming season, except for some necessary people to stay behind to look after the house, everyone else in the organs, schools, shops, and hospitals goes to the fields. In short, whether it is running industry or running agriculture, Xiajiang County has relied on the strength of the whole people, relied on the courage and determination to overcome difficulties, worked hard, and done practical work. Therefore, the difficulty of labor shortage cannot prevent them from advancing at high speed.

To Completely Solve the Labor Problem, We Must Also Grasp Technical Reform

Xiajiang County's experience is a good textbook for refuting those "condition-only" people, those who are still singing the low-pitched tunes of "no labor force" and "large-scale agriculture cannot be done without large-scale industry, and large-scale industry will inevitably affect agriculture." I once heard someone say publicly: "Grain must be done (this is right), it doesn't matter if there are a few tons less of steel (this is not right)." Recently, no one has been heard saying this publicly anymore. However, there are still some individuals who unilaterally emphasize "no labor force" and actually want to reduce the speed of industrial development. In their places, either they are reluctant to start, or they cannot transfer the labor force to support some key projects that need to be started quickly according to time and quantity, which affects the construction speed of these projects. In a county in Jiangxi Province, I heard a Party Secretary in charge of industry in a town say how difficult their labor force was, and that they could not spare many people to engage in iron smelting, so they only built three small earthen furnaces, and stopped production after smelting 100 jin of iron. Is there really no labor force? The town has a population of over 10,000, including over 5,000 agricultural population, with only over 8,000 mu of cultivated land, and other conditions are not worse than other places. If there is really no labor force here to engage in large-scale iron smelting, then, like Xiajiang County, it would not even be possible to engage in small-scale iron smelting? According to my understanding, iron smelting has not been done well in this town, and agriculture has not been at the forefront; on the contrary, compared to some other townships with the same conditions, or compared to Xiajiang County, the progress of agricultural production has also been left behind, which is very thought-provoking and reflective. In fact, what these comrades really lack is not the labor force, but the drive, the determination, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"striving for the upstream." Once right-leaning conservative thinking is at work in the mind, they dare not trust the masses, but are superstitious about their own labor account calculated according to the old rules, and as a result, they have to bow down to the difficulties of so-called "no labor force."

Finally, it should be mentioned that the labor force in Xiajiang County is not completely without problems. The labor force here is still tight, but if a series of technical reforms are carried out immediately after the ideological problems are solved, the so-called labor tension problem can be completely solved.
