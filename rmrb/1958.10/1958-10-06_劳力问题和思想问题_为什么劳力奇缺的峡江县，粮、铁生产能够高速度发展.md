Labor Problems and Ideological Problems

Why Can Xiajiang County, Where Labor is Severely Scarce, Achieve High-Speed Development in Grain and Iron Production?

By our reporter Ling Jianhua

Labor Shortage, Economic Backwardness, Rapid Progress

Xiajiang County, Jiangxi Province, has a small population, abundant land, and a lack of water resources. The county currently has a population of 64,000, including an agricultural population of 59,000, with over 410,000 mu of dry and paddy fields, including 385,000 mu of paddy fields. There are more than 13,000 male laborers, averaging 30 mu of cultivated land per person. Before liberation, women here did not participate in field labor. In recent years, some women have begun to participate in field labor, but generally, they do some auxiliary labor, and not many participate in transplanting and harvesting rice, and even fewer know how to harrow and plow the fields. Because of the small population and abundant land, and the severe labor shortage, most of the fields are only planted with one season of middle rice or late rice, and the cultivation is very rough. The average yield per mu for the whole year is generally only over 100 jin. The yields in 1955 and 1957 were relatively high, but the yield per mu was only about 210 jin, and the total output was only over 75 million jin.

Xiajiang County's industrial base had nothing except a small power plant. Some ironworkers, carpenters, and masons came from other counties, only a few of whom worked here year-round, and the rest were temporary workers who came to do odd jobs and then went back. Not a single ironworker, carpenter, or mason was from this county. For transportation, except for a highway from Nanchang to Ganzhou that passes through Xiajiang, there are no other roads in the county.

In such an area with a severe labor shortage and a very backward economic base, can we rely on our own labor force to develop agriculture at high speed? In particular, can we develop industry at high speed while developing agriculture at high speed, and implement the policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture? The practice of Xiajiang County has given an affirmative answer to this question.

The development of agricultural production in this county this year is at high speed. This year, they resolutely implemented measures such as changing one season to two seasons, universal close planting, and increasing fertilizer application. As a result, the total output of more than 360,000 mu of early rice reached more than 120 million jin, with an average yield of more than 300 jin per mu. The harvest of one season of early rice exceeded the total grain output of the whole year last year by more than 60%. Calculated by agricultural population, each person already has 2,100 jin of grain; calculated by the total urban and rural population of the county, each person also has nearly 2,000 jin of grain. The people here are striving to make late rice surpass early rice, and strive for each person to have 4,000 to 5,000 jin of grain a year. Now, late rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops are threatened by drought, but if there are no more major disasters, it is possible to achieve the target of 4,000 to 5,000 jin of grain per person. Even calculated at 4,000 jin per person, it is more than three times last year. The annual grain output far exceeds the total grain output of the past three years, and one year of planting can feed the population for four or five years. Isn't this development speed high speed?

The industry in this county is also developing at high speed this year. They organized several ironworkers (from other counties, who work here year-round), transferred dozens of farmers to be apprentices, and transferred a technician and a broken-down small lathe from the power plant, and established a Xiajiang Machinery Factory. Nearly 100 kilometers of highways and hundreds of kilometers of township and commune roads have been built. A high tide of large-scale iron smelting industry has been set off. A 14-cubic-meter blast furnace has been put into production, and 20 of the 42 0.5-cubic-meter earthen furnaces are in normal production. Twenty-four small coal mines have mined more than 300 tons of coal after being built and have begun to produce coke. A thousand workers are regularly engaged in iron smelting production. Recently, the county has transferred a large number of laborers to build two blast furnace groups for iron smelting, each consisting of dozens of blast furnaces; building furnaces and producing simultaneously, striving to produce 30,000 to 50,000 tons of iron and 300,000 tons of coal by the end of the year. If calculated at 30,000 tons of iron, the county will have an average of 1,000 jin of iron per person in just a few months. Isn't this development speed high speed?

First Calculate the Labor Account or First Calculate the Ideological Account

Since Xiajiang County has such a severe labor shortage, why is the development speed of industry and agriculture so fast? What is the most basic experience in their work?

1. In the past, whenever we talked about doing something, we always had to calculate a labor account first. In fact, the labor account can be calculated, but it can also not be calculated. Of course, we can calculate how many people there are in the county, but how much of the labor force is wasted in the use of labor? How much can a person's labor efficiency be improved? How many people did not participate in labor or did not participate in major labor in the past, and what is their labor potential? These accounts are often not able to be calculated. Some people with right-leaning conservative ideas always calculate the labor account according to the old rules, and cannot see or believe that the masses have great labor potential. As a result, once the account is calculated, it is "no labor force." Before last winter, the Xiajiang County Party Committee had also been calculating the account in this way, so it had been troubled by "no labor force." At that time, the annual task was to strive to plant crops on the cultivated land, as far as possible not to abandon the fields, and dared not think or do anything else. By last winter, when a mass rectification campaign came to the countryside, with great debates and big-character posters, the situation began to change greatly. As soon as the enthusiasm of the masses rose, there was immediately a high tide of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and the scale and speed far exceeded the original expectations. From then on, the County Party Committee understood a truth: in the past, on the one hand, there was a severe labor shortage, and on the other hand, there was a waste of labor; there were few people and little labor, but one person could top two or three... From then on, whenever someone was still calculating the labor account according to the old rules, the County Party Committee insisted on another new calculation method, that is: how many laborers can one laborer top? How many semi-laborers can top full laborers? How many people who were not considered laborers (did not participate in labor) can be counted as laborers (participated in labor)? In this way, some people who shouted "no labor force" had nothing to say. This is an experience.

2. However, relying on this new calculation method does not completely solve ideological problems, and there are still many accounts that cannot be specifically calculated. Therefore, Xiajiang County has another experience, which is to debate whether to do something, why to do it, and whether it is okay not to do it? Do not fall into the small circle of calculating the labor account first. For things that must be done and must be done, we must advance in the face of difficulties and be determined to start. Once "forced," coupled with trusting and relying on the masses, a solution will come out. This spring, the County Party Committee decided to change middle rice to early rice, one season to two seasons, and also to universally plant closely (increasing from 4,500 seedlings per mu in the past to 9,000 seedlings, and a few reaching 10,000 to 20,000 seedlings), and increase fertilizer application (increasing from dozens of loads of fertilizer per mu in the past to 200 to 300 loads). If the labor account is calculated according to the old rules, it will increase by at least four or five times compared to the past. In the end, how much labor potential could be tapped was not clear at the beginning. As a result, in the practice of working hard, many methods came out, and many difficulties were solved. In the past, only more than 170,000 mu of middle rice (4,000 to 5,000 seedlings per mu) in the county also dragged on for a month or so to harvest, but this year, more than 360,000 mu of early rice (9,000 seedlings per mu) was harvested in half a month. Some townships that worked quickly only spent seven or eight days.

When the large-scale iron smelting industry started in the second half of this year, although it encountered the "big hurdle" of labor force again, they seized the time before the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting to build the first batch of forty-eight furnaces. During the busy season of "double搶" (rush harvesting and rush planting), they also ensured that about half of the furnaces were in normal production. Now they are freeing up a large amount of labor and transferring it to the iron and steel front.

3. Great debates, big-character posters, and large-scale mass movements are another experience of Xiajiang County in organizing the labor force. Since last winter, there has been one movement after another, and one shock after another, which is indeed very tense. However, cadres and the masses recognize the significance of this tension. For example, because there are few people and abundant land here, people's desire to have tractors and water pumps, and to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture is particularly urgent. When conducting a great debate on large-scale iron smelting industry, after understanding that there is no mechanization without steel, and it is impossible to fundamentally get rid of the labor shortage, everyone's enthusiasm for running steel greatly increased, and they were happy to be more tense at present. In this way, in the unfavorable factor of few people and abundant land for large-scale iron smelting industry, there also emerged favorable factors to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the masses and tap the labor potential to run the large-scale iron smelting industry.

In various movements, they skillfully used the methods of big-character posters and great debates to solve fundamental problems. Recently, at the construction site of the two newly built eight-cubic-meter blast furnaces, once the debate and appraisal were grasped, the labor efficiency greatly improved, and the transportation team increased from completing nine trips a day (the distance is about one and a half li) to fourteen trips and eighteen trips, and the load capacity of each trip also doubled. From here, everyone understood a truth: whether the labor efficiency is high or not, the most fundamental thing is still the ideological problem.

Now, Xiajiang County has gradually formed some new labor systems. Such as the militarization of labor organization, part-time work and part-time farming, the combination of education and labor, cadres participating in labor, and organizing labor cooperation, etc. The universal promotion and regular adherence to these systems enable all men, women, old and young, workers, farmers, merchants, and students in the county to exert their labor potential. Some children who have not yet been able to participate in labor have also formed field cheerleading squads to boost morale. Deng Maochang, the vice county magistrate of Xiajiang County, who is over fifty years old, is an old comrade who participated in the Soviet revolution here, and is still a labor expert. In rush harvesting and rush planting, he ran to the mountainous areas and worked in the fields, and could work two or three mu a day. Liu Chunhe, the director of the County Metallurgical Bureau, is a leading cadre, technical personnel, and ordinary worker at the furnace construction site. The responsible comrades in the county are often either in the fields or on the construction site, and rarely live in the organs. In the busy farming season, except for some necessary people to stay behind to look after the house, everyone else in the organs, schools, shops, and hospitals goes to the fields. In short, whether it is running industry or running agriculture, Xiajiang County has relied on the strength of the whole people, relied on the courage and determination to overcome difficulties, worked hard, and done practical work. Therefore, the difficulty of labor shortage cannot prevent them from advancing at high speed.

To Completely Solve the Labor Problem, We Must Also Grasp Technical Reform

Xiajiang County's experience is a good textbook for refuting those "condition-only" people, those who are still singing the low-pitched tunes of "no labor force" and "large-scale agriculture cannot be done without large-scale industry, and large-scale industry will inevitably affect agriculture." I once heard someone say publicly: "Grain must be done (this is right), it doesn't matter if there are a few tons less of steel (this is not right)." Recently, no one has been heard saying this publicly anymore. However, there are still some individuals who unilaterally emphasize "no labor force" and actually want to reduce the speed of industrial development. In their places, either they are reluctant to start, or they cannot transfer the labor force to support some key projects that need to be started quickly according to time and quantity, which affects the construction speed of these projects. In a county in Jiangxi Province, I heard a Party Secretary in charge of industry in a town say how difficult their labor force was, and that they could not spare many people to engage in iron smelting, so they only built three small earthen furnaces, and stopped production after smelting 100 jin of iron. Is there really no labor force? The town has a population of over 10,000, including over 5,000 agricultural population, with only over 8,000 mu of cultivated land, and other conditions are not worse than other places. If there is really no labor force here to engage in large-scale iron smelting, then, like Xiajiang County, it would not even be possible to engage in small-scale iron smelting? According to my understanding, iron smelting has not been done well in this town, and agriculture has not been at the forefront; on the contrary, compared to some other townships with the same conditions, or compared to Xiajiang County, the progress of agricultural production has also been left behind, which is very thought-provoking and reflective. In fact, what these comrades really lack is not the labor force, but the drive, the determination, and the idea of ​​"striving for the upstream." Once right-leaning conservative thinking is at work in the mind, they dare not trust the masses, but are superstitious about their own labor account calculated according to the old rules, and as a result, they have to bow down to the difficulties of so-called "no labor force."

Finally, it should be mentioned that the labor force in Xiajiang County is not completely without problems. The labor force here is still tight, but if a series of technical reforms are carried out immediately after the ideological problems are solved, the so-called labor tension problem can be completely solved.

    劳力问题和思想问题
    为什么劳力奇缺的峡江县，粮、铁生产能够高速度发展
    本报记者　凌建华
    劳力奇缺经济落后进度飞速
    江西省峡江县，人少地多，水源缺乏。全县现有人口六万四千人，其中农业人口五万九千人，有水旱地四十一万多亩，其中水地三十八万五千亩。男劳动力一万三千多人，平均每人负担耕地三十亩。解放以前，这里的妇女不参加田间劳动。前几年，有些妇女开始参加田间劳动，但一般是做些辅助劳动，参加插秧、割禾的不多，会耙田、犁田的更少。因为人少地多，劳力奇缺，绝大多数田地都只种一季中稻或晚稻，耕作非常粗糙。全年平均亩产量，一般只有一百多斤，1955年和1957年产量比较高，亩产也只二百一十斤左右，总产量只有七千五百多万斤。
    峡江县的工业基础，除了一个小小发电厂以外，什么也没有。一些铁工、木工、泥工，还是从外县来的，其中只有很少的人常年在这里做工，其余都是临时来干些零活，干完了就回去。本县的人，一个铁工、木工、泥工也没有。交通运输，除了一条从南昌到赣州的干道穿过峡江境内以外，全县没有一条其它的公路。
    在这样一个人力奇缺、经济基础十分落后的地区，能不能依靠自己的人力，高速度发展农业？特别是能不能在高速度发展农业的同时，高速度发展工业，贯彻执行工业和农业同时并举的方针？这个问题，峡江县的实践已经作出了肯定的答案。
    这个县今年农业生产的发展是高速度的。今年，这里坚决地实行了一季变双季，普遍密植和增施肥料等措施，结果，三十六万多亩早稻，总产量达到一亿二千多万斤，平均亩产三百多斤。一季早稻的收成，就超过了去年全年粮食总产量60％以上。按农业人口计算，每人已有粮二千一百斤；按全县城乡人口计算，每人也有粮近二千斤。这里的人民正在力促晚稻超早稻，争取每人一年有粮四千斤至五千斤。现在晚稻、红薯等作物遭受干旱的威胁，但是，如果不再有特大灾害，实现每人有粮四千至五千斤的指标是可能的。即以每人四千斤计算，也等于去年的三倍以上。一年的粮食产量远远超过了过去三年粮食产量的总和，种一年可以吃上四、五年。这种发展速度，难道不是高速度吗？
    这个县今年的工业也正在高速度发展着。他们把几个铁工（外县人，常年在这里做工）组织起来，抽调了几十个农民来当学徒，再从发电厂调来一个技术工人和一只破旧的小车床，就成立了一个峡江机械厂。近一百公里的公路和几百公里的乡社大道已经修成。大办炼铁工业的高潮已经掀起。一个十四立方公尺的高炉投入生产，四十二个零点五立方公尺的土炉，已有二十个正常生产。二十四个小煤井在建成后已挖出煤三百多吨，并且开始炼出焦炭。经常从事炼铁生产的工人已有一千人。最近，这个县又调出大批劳动力，突击建成两个各由几十个高炉组成的炼铁高炉群；边建炉、边生产，力争到年底产铁三万吨至五万吨，产煤三十万吨。如果以三万吨铁计算，在短短几个月内，全县平均每人就有铁一千斤。这种发展速度，难道不是高速度吗？
    先算劳力账还是先算思想账
    峡江县的劳动力既然那么奇缺，为什么工农业的发展速度又是那么快？他们工作中最基本的经验是什么呢？
    一、过去，一谈到要办什么事，总是要先算一笔劳力账。其实，劳力账，能算，也不能算。全县有多少人，当然可以算得出来，但是在使用劳动力中，有多少是浪费掉了的？一个人的劳动效率，能够提高多少？有多少人过去不参加劳动或者不参加主要劳动，他（她）们的劳动潜力究竟有多大？这些账，却往往不是能够算得出来的。一些有右倾保守思想的人，他们在算劳力账的时候，总是按照过去的老规矩来算，看不到和不相信群众蕴藏着伟大的劳动潜力。结果，一算了账，就是“没有劳动力”。峡江县委在去年冬季以前，也一直在这样算账，因此也一直在为“没有劳动力”苦恼。那时候，每年的任务就是争取把耕地种上庄稼，尽可能不要荒掉了田，别的事都不敢想也不敢做。到了去年冬天，农村里来了个全民整风，大鸣大放大辩论大字报，局面开始大变。群众的积极性一高涨，马上来了个兴修水利和积肥的高潮，规模和速度远远超出了原来的预料。从此，县委懂得了一条道理：在过去，一方面是劳力奇缺，一方面又是劳力浪费；人少劳动力少，但是一个可以顶上二个三个……。以后每当有人还在按照陈规算劳力账的时候，县委就坚持另一个新的算账法，这就是：一个劳力能顶上几个劳力？有多少半劳力能顶上全劳力？有多少原来不算劳动力（不参加劳动）的人，能够算上劳动力（参加劳动）？这样一来，一些叫唤“没有劳动力”的人也就无话可说了。这是一条经验。
    二、但是，依靠这种新的算账法，并不能完全解决思想问题，有很多账还是无法具体算出来的。因此，峡江县有另一条经验，就是办什么事，先辩论要不要办，为什么要办，不办行不行？不要先堕入到算劳力账的小圈子里去。对于一定要办、非办不可的事，就要知难而进，决心上马。一“逼”，再加上信任和依靠群众，办法就会出来。今春，县委决定把中稻变早稻，一季变两季，还要普遍密植（从过去每亩插秧四千五百蔸增加到九千蔸，少数达到一万几千至二万蔸），增施肥料（从过去每亩施肥几十担增加到二、三百担），如果按照陈规算劳力账，至少也要比过去增加四、五倍。究竟能挖掘出多少劳动潜力来，开始也没有办法算清楚。结果在狠心苦干的实践中，很多办法出来了，很多困难迎刃而解了。过去，全县只有十七万多亩中稻（每亩四、五千蔸），也要拖拖拉拉收割个把月，今年，三十六万多亩早稻（每亩九千蔸），半个月就抢割完了。有些乡干得快的，只花了七、八天时间。
    今年下半年开始大搞炼铁工业的时候，虽然又碰到了劳动力这个“大关”，但是，他们在夏收夏种大忙以前，抓紧建成了第一批四十八个炉子。在“双抢”大忙期间，也保证了半数左右的炉子正常生产。现在他们正腾出大量的劳动力，调到钢铁战线上去。
    三、大辩论，大字报，大搞群众运动，这是峡江县组织劳动力的又一条经验。从去冬以来，这里是一个运动紧接一个运动，一个突击紧接一个突击，确实是很紧张的。但是，干部和群众认识到这种紧张包含着什么意义。譬如，由于这里人少地多，人们要求有拖拉机、抽水机，要求实现农业半机械化和机械化的愿望就特别迫切，当着进行关于大办炼铁工业的大辩论，懂得了没有钢铁就没有机械化，没有机械化就不可能从根本上摆脱劳动力的紧张以后，大家办钢铁的积极性大大高涨，都乐于在目前再紧张一些。这样一来，在人少地多这个不利于大办钢铁工业的因素中，也产生出了激发群众劳动积极性，挖掘劳动潜力来大办钢铁工业的有利因素。
    在各个运动中，他们纯熟地运用大字报大辩论的方法，解决根本性的问题。最近，在新建的二座八立方公尺高炉的工地上，一抓住辩论、评比，劳动效率就大大提高，运输组由每天完成九车（路程约一里半）增加到十四车、十八车，每车的载重量也增加了一倍以上。从这里，大家懂得了一条道理：劳动效率高不高，最根本的还是思想问题。
    现在，峡江县逐步形成了一些新的劳动制度。如劳动组织军事化、亦工亦农、教育和劳动结合、干部参加劳动，以及组织劳力协作等等。这些制度的普遍推广和经常坚持，就使得全县的男女老少、工农商学，都发挥出他们的劳动潜力。有些还未能参加劳动的小孩子，也组成了田间啦啦队，助威壮势。已经有五十多岁的峡江县副县长邓茂昌，是一个参加过这里的苏维埃革命的老同志，现在还是一个劳动能手，在抢收抢种中，他跑到山区去，下田干，一天能干二、三亩。县冶金局长刘春和在建炉工地上，是领导干部、技术人员，又是普通工人。县里的负责同志，经常不是在田间，就是在工地，极少住在机关。这里的机关、学校、商店、医院，在农忙季节，除了有些必要的留个把人看家以外，其它的人全都到田间去。总之，不论是办工业，还是办农业，峡江县都依靠了全民的力量，依靠了敢于战胜困难的勇气和决心，艰苦奋斗，苦干、实干，因此，劳动力奇缺的困难并不能阻挡他们高速度地前进。
  完全解决劳力还须抓紧技术改革
    峡江县的经验，对于批驳那些“唯条件论”者，那些至今还在唱着“没有劳动力”、“要大搞农业就不能大搞工业，要大搞工业就必然影响农业”的低沉的调子的人，是一部很好的教材。曾经听到有人公开说：“粮食非搞不行（这是对的），钢铁少几吨没有关系（这就不对）”。最近，已经没有听到有人公开这样说了。但是，片面强调“没有劳动力”，实际上想降低工业发展速度的人，也还不是个别的。在他们那里，不是自己迟迟不肯上马，就是不能按时间、按数量把劳动力抽调出来支援一些需要迅速开工的重点工程，以致影响了这些工程的建设速度。在江西省的一个县里，我听到一个镇的主管工业的党委书记说他们那里的劳动力是怎么困难，抽不出多少人来搞炼铁，因此只建成了三个小土炉，炼出了一百斤铁以后就停止生产。究竟有没有劳动力呢？这个镇有一万多人口，其中有五千多农业人口，耕地只有八千多亩，其它的条件也并不比别的地方差，如果这里真的没有劳动力大搞炼铁，那末，像峡江县，不是连小小的搞炼铁都不可能了么？据我了解，这个镇炼铁没有搞好，农业也并没有走在前面；恰恰相反，比起别的一些条件相同的乡镇，或者是比起峡江县来，农业生产的进度也被抛到后面去了，这是很可以令人深思反省的事。其实，这些同志所真正缺乏的，并不是劳动力，而是干劲，是决心，是“力争上游”的思想。右倾保守思想一在脑子作怪，就不敢于信任群众，而是迷信于自己那一笔按照老规矩算出来的劳力账，结果，就只好拜倒于所谓“没有劳动力”的困难的面前了。
    最后，应当提到峡江县的劳力也不是完全没有问题的。这里的劳力仍然是紧张的，不过，在解决了思想问题以后，如果紧接着进行一系列的技术改革，所谓劳力紧张问题也就可以完全解决了。
