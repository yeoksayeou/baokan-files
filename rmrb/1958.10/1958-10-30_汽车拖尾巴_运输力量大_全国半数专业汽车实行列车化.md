Cars with Trailers: Greatly Increased Transportation Capacity
Half of the Nation's Professional Trucks are Being Converted to Trains

    This newspaper reports: The use of trailers for transportation is being widely promoted throughout the country. As of mid-October, more than 20,000 of the over 40,000 professional transport vehicles have been equipped with one or more trailers.

    According to June statistics, there were only 4,500 trailers nationwide. By the end of August, this had grown to over 8,000. Now, it has reached 24,000. Among these trailers, some are large-tonnage trailers, each with a carrying capacity of six or eight tons; some are small-tonnage trailers, each with a carrying capacity of one and a half tons; the majority of trailers have a carrying capacity of three tons. Calculating an average carrying capacity of three tons, the nation's automobile transport capacity has increased by more than 50,000 tons compared to June, equivalent to the transport capacity of over 14,000 Liberation brand trucks.

    Provinces and cities with better trailer development include Shandong, Sichuan, Hebei, Liaoning, Guizhou, Yunnan, Heilongjiang, and Beijing. Each of these has over 1,000 trailers, with Shandong Province being the most outstanding, now having 2,672 trailers. In addition, Henan Province also has around 1,000 trailers.

    However, the current automobile transport capacity still cannot meet the needs of the growing volume of transport. Therefore, it is necessary to continue developing trailer transport and achieving the "truck train" concept.

    汽车拖尾巴　运输力量大
    全国半数专业汽车实行列车化
    本报讯　各地正在普遍推广了挂车运输。截至10月中旬止，在四万多辆专业运输的汽车中已有二万多辆挂上了一辆或几辆挂车。
    根据6月份统计；全国只有四千五百辆挂车，到了8月底发展为八千多辆，现在已达二万四千辆，在这些挂车中，有些是大吨位的挂车，每辆载重六吨、八吨；有些是小吨位的挂车，每辆载重一吨半；多数挂车的载重能力达三吨。平均以三吨载重计算，全国汽车运力已比6月份增加了五万多个吨位，相当于一万四千多辆解放牌汽车的运输能力。
    发展挂车比较好的有山东、四川、河北、辽宁、贵州、云南、黑龙江、北京等八个省市，他们的挂车都已达一千多辆，其中又以山东省最突出，现在已有二千六百七十二辆挂车。此外，河南省的挂车也已达千辆左右。
    但目前汽车运力仍不能适应运量增长的需要。为此，还需要继续发展挂车运输，实现汽车列车化。
