Guarantee Simultaneous Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture
Shaanxi Pays Attention to Giving Play to the Subjective Initiative of the Masses and Tapping Labor Potential

(Our Dispatch) Shaanxi Province is criticizing conservative thinking in the unified arrangement of labor. The laboring masses are doing everything possible to tap the potential of labor and overcome the difficulties of insufficient labor, effectively guaranteeing the all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The scale of farmland water conservancy basic construction in Shaanxi Province this winter and next spring is much larger than in the past. Water conservancy and soil conservation projects alone involve 6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone, more than double that of last year. It is generally estimated that the labor used for processing per mu of land is now more than double that of the past. Autumn harvesting, autumn planting, deep plowing, and fertilizer accumulation all require a large amount of labor. The new high tide of the iron and steel industry and construction undertakings such as transportation, according to calculations by relevant leading departments, require 1.8 million to 2 million laborers. Therefore, many counties feel a lack of labor in arranging labor.

However, some places in Shaanxi have discovered that some cadres have conservative ideas in the initial calculation and arrangement of labor. They regard labor as a fixed and unchanging natural force, failing to see the subjective initiative of people, the strong potential of labor, and the waste in the current use of labor. Therefore, the more they calculate, the more they feel the lack of labor. Although most areas of Shaanxi Province have now established communes, run a large number of nurseries, canteens, and sewing groups, and widely carry out agricultural tool reforms, which have provided many favorable conditions for liberating and rationally using labor, some cadres do not calculate these favorable factors. Some areas regard women or men over 45 as half-laborers, but in fact, many women and men around 50 are full laborers. Some people think that transportation must be undertaken by full laborers, but in fact, after adding ball bearings to vehicles, heavy work becomes light work, and many auxiliary laborers can handle it. Some people do not see the repetition and waste of labor.

In further arranging labor, many places in Shaanxi Province have abandoned the old method of only calculating accounts among cadres and relied on and mobilized the masses to make arrangements, which effectively solved the difficulty of insufficient labor. Xixiang County has 110,000 laborers, of which 34,000 people smelt iron, and 6,000 people repair roads and water conservancy. Cadres calculated that only 60,000 laborers could be invested in the blitz deep plowing. However, after mobilizing the masses, the masses mobilized all kinds of manpower, and 80,000 people participated in deep plowing, plowing 10,000 mu per day.

The following are some good methods provided by various places in Shaanxi in arranging labor: First, based on the establishment of communes, overall planning, division of battle lines, and organization of various construction corps and professional teams. Each county has formed construction corps such as iron and steel, water conservancy, autumn harvest and planting, and transportation according to local tasks. Each commune has also formed various production professional teams. The advantage of organizing these professional construction teams is that they are tightly organized, have good labor discipline, are easy to mobilize and improve labor skills, and have high labor efficiency.

Second, reasonably allocate and use labor according to the priority and urgency of each task, combining them with each other. After 30,000 people in Chang'an County went to the mountains to complete the task of mountain management, they immediately turned to iron smelting. They also combined water conservancy construction with tree planting, carrying tree seeds for planting when repairing water conservancy, accomplishing several tasks at once.

Third, while improving agricultural tools, vigorously improve relevant iron smelting and transportation tools and operating methods to improve labor efficiency. The water conservancy construction corps in Xixiang County improved the drilling operation method, increasing efficiency by more than 11 times, from 1.5 cubic meters per person per day to more than 17. If this item is promoted throughout the county, it can save more than 80% of the working days.

Fourth, make full use of hydropower; overcome unnecessary repetitive labor. Some areas use hydropower instead of manpower to pull the bellows of iron smelting furnaces and transport ore and fuel; some areas have readjusted the land after the establishment of communes, turning the distant land of the past production teams into nearby land; some have also moved the threshing floor, composting, sheepfolds, and pigsties to the mountains or the edge of the fields, all of which have saved a lot of labor.

    保证工农业同时跃进
    陕西注意发挥群众主观能动作用，挖掘劳动潜力
    本报讯　陕西省各地在统一安排劳动力中批判保守思想，劳动群众千方百计挖掘劳动力的潜力，克服劳力不足困难，有效地保证了工农业生产的全面跃进。今冬明春陕西省农田水利基本建设规模比过去大大增加，单是水利、水土保持工程就有六十亿土方、石方，超过去年一倍还多。一般估计，现在每亩地加工所用的劳动力，也比过去增加两倍以上。秋收、秋种、深翻地、积肥等都需要大批的劳动力。新的钢铁工业高潮以及交通运输等建设事业，据有关领导部门计算，就需要一百八十万到二百万个劳动力。因此，许多县在安排劳动力中，深感劳力缺乏。
    但陕西有些地方在开始计算安排劳动力中，曾经发现一些干部存在着保守思想，他们把劳动力当成固定不变的自然力量来计算，看不到人的主观能动作用，看不到劳动力的雄厚潜力和现在使用劳动力方面的浪费。因此他们越计算就越加感到劳动力不足。虽然目前陕西全省各地绝大部分地区建立了公社，举办了大量的托儿所、食堂和缝纫组，广泛进行着农具改革，这都给解放和合理使用劳动力提供了许多有利条件，但是有些干部并不计算这些有利因素。有的地区把妇女或者四十五岁以上的男人都当成半劳动力，实际上现在许多妇女、五十岁左右的男人都是全劳动力。有的人以为运输必须由全劳动力担负，实际上车子加滚珠轴承以后，重活变成了轻活，许多辅助劳力都能胜任。有的人看不到劳动在重复、浪费。
    在进一步安排劳动力时，陕西省不少地方抛弃了仅仅在干部中算账的老办法，依靠和发动群众进行安排，这样就有效地解决了劳动力不足的困难。西乡全县有十一万个劳动力，其中三万四千人炼铁，六千人修公路和水利，干部计算只能有六万个劳动力投入突击深翻地。但是在发动群众以后，群众动员了各种人力，参加深翻地的达到八万人，一天翻地一万亩。
    陕西各地在安排劳力中提供了以下一些好办法：一、在建立公社的基础上统筹兼顾，划分战线，组织各种建设兵团和专业队。各县按当地任务组成了钢铁、水利、秋收秋种、运输等建设兵团。各个公社也都组成了各种生产专业队。组织这些专业建设队伍的好处是：组织严密，劳动纪律好，便于调动和提高劳动技能，劳动效率高。
    二、按各项任务的轻重缓急和先后，互相结合，合理调配和使用劳动力。长安县三万人上山完成治山任务以后，马上转入炼铁。他们还把修水利和植树结合，修水利时带上树籽植树，毕数功于一役。
    三、在改进农具的同时，大力改进有关炼铁和运输工具和操作方法，提高劳动效率。西乡县水利建设兵团改进了打眼操作方法，效率提高了十一倍多，每人每日由完成一点五个石方提高到十七个以上，即此一项如在全县推广就可节省出80％多的劳动日。
    四、充分利用水力；克服不必要的重复劳动。有的地区利用水力代替人力拉炼铁炉的风箱和运输矿石、燃料；有的地区在公社建立后重新调整土地，化各个生产队过去的远地为近地；有的还把打场、沤肥、羊圈和猪圈搬上山或搬到地头，都节省下大量劳动力。
