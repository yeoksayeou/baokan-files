Glossary of Terms

    Celestial Surveyor – An unmanned observation object equipped with television sets, instruments, and radio equipment, sent to observe near other planets.
    Nebula – A system encompassing millions upon millions of stars.
    Centaurus – A constellation is a code name for an area of the sky. "Centaurus" is a term from Greek mythology, similar to how we refer to the "Cowherd" and "Weaver Girl" stars.
    First Cosmic Velocity – The velocity of a satellite, approximately 8 kilometers per second.
    Second Cosmic Velocity – The velocity required to escape the Earth's gravitational field, a little over 11 kilometers per second.
    Third Cosmic Velocity – The velocity required to escape the solar system's gravitational field, 16.5 kilometers per second.
    Jet Velocity – Eight-thirds of a kilometer per second, or approximately 2.7 kilometers per second.
    Ethynyl – A compound of one carbon atom and one hydrogen atom.
    Free Radical in Chemistry – A chemical compound within a normal chemical molecule that is missing one or several atoms. It is not a complete, normal molecule, but rather a part of a whole molecule.
    Atomic Hydrogen – A single, existing hydrogen atom is called atomic hydrogen (ordinary hydrogen exists as hydrogen molecules formed by the combination of two hydrogen atoms).
    "Dislocation" of Atomic Arrangement – The arrangement of atoms in a metal crystal should follow certain rules. "Dislocation" refers to the disruption of this arrangement in a localized area. This situation is called "dislocation."
    Metal "Whiskers" – In the process of metal crystallization, using special methods, very fine metal filaments resembling whiskers are produced.
    Cosmic Rays: Cosmic rays are a type of radiation constantly emitted from outside the Earth. They possess great energy, which has consistently attracted the attention of scientists. Cosmic rays are mainly composed of hydrogen nuclei approaching the speed of light, as well as helium nuclei and more important atomic nuclei such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei. Their energy is very high, exceeding that of the high-energy (ten billion electron volts) particles obtained by the world's synchrophasotrons by a factor of ten billion.
    Solar Radiation – The energy radiated by the sun in all directions at various wavelengths.
    Micrometeoroids – Small meteors that are diffused in the high atmosphere.
    Ionosphere – The upper atmospheric layer above 80 kilometers from the Earth's surface is called the ionosphere. Ordinary air does not conduct electricity, but many molecules in this layer carry positive and negative charges (a phenomenon called ionization), making it conductive. Radio communication relies on the reflection of the ionosphere to transmit over longer distances, so the study of the ionosphere has a very important impact on radio communication.
    Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935) – Born into a forester's family in Izhevskoye village, Ryazan Province, Russia. Due to deafness and poverty, he was unable to attend school. He relied on diligent self-study and began working as a middle school teacher at the age of twenty. During his forty years of teaching, in addition to teaching, he squeezed in time to study astronomy, chemistry, and aeronautical science. Due to his bold imagination and diligent research, he published many scientific works related to the conquest of the universe throughout his life. He also created giant spacecraft models and a batch of jet propulsion engines, becoming the founder of astronautics.

    名词解释
    测视体——到别的星球附近去观察的带有电视机、仪表、无线电设备的无人观察物体。
    星云——包括千千万万个恒星的体系。
    半人马星座——星座是天空一个区域的代号。“半人马”是希腊神话的一个名词，犹如我们说“牛郎”、“织女”星一样。
    第一宇宙速度——即卫星的速度。接近于每秒八公里。
    第二宇宙速度——脱离地球引力场的速度。每秒十一公里多。
    第三宇宙速度——脱离太阳系引力场的速度，每秒十六点五公里。
    喷气速度——每秒三分之八公里，即二公里七弱。
    由炔基——一个碳原子和一个氢原子的化合物。
    化学中的自由基——在一个普通的化学分子里面，少掉一个或几个原子的化学化合物。它不是一个普通的整个的分子，而是整个的分子的一部分。
    原子氢——单独存在的氢的原子就叫原子氢（普通的氢是以两个氢原子结合而成的氢分子状态的）。
    原子排列的“位错”——金属结晶中原子的排列应该有一定的规则。“位错”就是局部地方的排列被破坏了。这种情况就叫“位错”。
    金属“须”——在金属结晶的过程里，用特殊的方法，让它产生非常细的如同胡子一般的金属丝。
    宇宙线：宇宙线是由地球外面不断发射来的一种射线。它具有很大的能量，所以一直引起科学家的注意。宇宙线主要是由接近光速的氢核构成，此外有氦核和更重要的原子核如碳、氮、氧核等。它们的能量很大，比世界上的同步稳相加速器所获得的高能量（一百亿电子伏特）粒子，还大一百亿倍。
    太阳辐射——是太阳以各种不同波长向四方面放射出来的能量。
    微流星——是弥漫在高空里的小的流星。
    电离层——离地球表面八十公里以上的高空大气层，叫做电离层。
  通常的空气是不导电的，可是这层空气中很多分子带有正电和负电（这种现象叫做电离现象），因此是导电的。无线电通讯，要依靠电离层的反射才能传得远一些，所以电离层的研究对无线电通讯有极重要的影响。
    齐奥尔科夫斯基（1857—1935）出身于俄国列山省伊柴夫斯克村一个守林人家里。由于耳聋和家境贫困，使他没法进学校读书。他靠刻苦自学，在二十岁时开始担任了一个中学的教师。在四十年的教学生活中，他除教学外，还挤时间自学天文学、化学和航空科学。由于他的大胆幻想和刻苦钻研，在他的一生中发表了许多有关征服宇宙的科学著作。并且制造出巨型飞船模型和一批喷气推进机，成为星际航行学的创始人。
