Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th - The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a recent provincial conference on coke and raw coal production, issued the call to "Refine coke and run coal mines in a mass movement by the whole Party and all the people, work hard for three months, fulfill the annual coke and raw coal production tasks twenty-four days ahead of schedule, and vigorously organize a high-yield month for coke and raw coal production in October."
Since September, the coal industry in the province has achieved great development while supporting steel production. However, with the leap forward in steel production, current coal production is far from meeting the needs. According to the province's average daily iron production of about 30,000 tons in the next three months, as well as the needs of other industries and civilian use, the daily output of coke needs to be increased from the current 1,700 tons to 19,000 tons, and the daily output of coal needs to be increased from the current 46,000 tons to over 100,000 tons.

Currently, all regions and mining bureaus in the province have revised their leap forward targets for raw coal and coke, ensuring that a leap forward upsurge in coal production will be launched throughout the province in the fourth quarter. According to the new leap forward targets, the province's raw coal production plan for this year will be increased from 15 million tons to more than 26 million tons, and the coke production task will also leap forward from 1.5 million tons to more than 3.7 million tons.

In order to achieve the revised coal leap forward targets and store up "grain and grass" for the steel marshal as much and as early as possible, in addition to doing everything possible to increase production in large coal mines such as Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, and Hebi, all regions in the province will, in accordance with the Party Central Committee's policy of "small, indigenous, and mass," mobilize the masses to run coal mines and vigorously develop small coal pits. At present, there are more than 1,300 small coal pits run by the people's communes in the province. In the fourth quarter, in addition to further increasing the production potential of the existing small coal pits, they also plan to newly open more than 4,800 small coal pits and mines, and organize a 500,000-strong coal production army to throw themselves into the mass movement of coal production by the whole Party and all the people. According to the experience of the existing small coal pits in various regions, open-pit coal mines will be vigorously mined. The advantage of this type of coal mine is that it can be mined quickly, with great results, and can also eliminate the threat of groundwater encountered in the current production of small coal pits. The second is to mine small coal pits in the form of adits, inclined shafts, and vertical shafts. After launching the mass movement of small coal pits, all key coal-producing areas must not only strive for self-sufficiency in coal, but also undertake the glorious task of supporting other provinces and cities with coal.

In terms of coke production, since August, the province has produced more than 92,000 tons of coke, an increase of 127% over the total output of last year, and 70% of the province's more than 2,000 coking furnaces have been put into production. However, these achievements are still far from meeting the needs of current steel production. Therefore, in addition to giving full play to the role of existing coking furnaces, all regions must also adopt the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach, mobilize the masses to build small indigenous coking furnaces in a decentralized manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th - The 532 small coal pits in Baofeng County, Henan Province, showed great power around National Day. From September 25 to 30, the average daily output of raw coal reached 9,000 tons. By October 3, it had released a "satellite" with a daily output of 30,441 tons of raw coal.

Baofeng County has very good and abundant coal resources, and the masses have had the habit of mining small coal pits since ancient times. Since the large-scale development of the steel industry in September, in order to ensure the needs of steel production and fuel in all aspects, the Baofeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has made full use of the favorable conditions and determined the policy of "small-scale as the main, indigenous methods as the main, and people-run as the main" to mobilize the masses to vigorously develop coal production. All 532 various types of coal pits dug by the masses in the county have been put into production. Starting from September 8, the daily coal output of the county jumped from 70 tons to 5,135 tons. Afterwards, until the end of September, the daily output of raw coal from small coal pits remained above 4,000 tons.

In order to solve the technical problems of coal production and further organize the leap forward, the Baofeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China has assembled more than 5,000 technicians and adopted the method of old mines leading new mines and large mines leading small mines to improve the production capacity of small coal pits.

    煤炭工业紧追钢铁
    河南省组织五十万大军上山挖煤
    宝丰大办小煤窑日产超过三万吨
    据新华社郑州6日电　“全党全民大炼焦炭，大办煤矿，苦战三个月，提前二十四天完成全年焦炭、原煤生产任务，大力组织10月份焦炭、原煤生产高产月”。这是中共河南省委在最近召开的全省焦炭、原煤生产会议上提出的号召。
    9月份以来，全省煤炭工业在支援钢铁生产的前提下，生产获得很大的发展，但是随着钢铁生产的跃进，当前的煤炭生产还远远不能满足需要，按照全省今后三个月平均日产铁三万吨左右，以及其他工业和民用的需要，焦炭的日产量就需要由现在的一千七百吨提高到一万九千吨，煤的日产量就需要由现在的四万六千吨提高到十万吨以上。
    目前，省内各地区、各矿务局都已修订了原煤、焦炭的跃进指标，保证在第四季度里，在全省掀起一个煤炭生产的跃进高潮。按照新的跃进指标，今年全省的原煤生产计划将由一千五百万吨提高到二千六百多万吨，焦炭的生产任务也由一百五十万吨跃进到三百七十多万吨。
    为了实现修订后的煤炭跃进指标，尽多、尽早地为钢铁元帅储备“粮草”，除了千方百计地使焦作、平顶山、鹤壁等大煤矿增加生产以外，全省各地都将根据党中央提出的“小、土、群”的方针，发动群众，全民办煤矿，大搞小煤窑。目前全省人民公社自办的小煤窑已有一千三百多个，在第四季度，各地除了进一步提高原有小煤窑的生产潜力外，还准备新开采四千八百多个小煤窑和矿井，并要组织五十万人的煤炭生产大军，投入全党全民大办煤炭的热潮。根据各地原有小煤窑生产的经验，将大力开采露天煤矿，这种煤矿的优点是开采快，收效大，而且可以解除当前小煤窑生产中所遇到的地下水的威胁。其次是开采平洞、斜井和立井式的小煤窑。在开展群众性的小煤窑运动后，各个重点产煤地区都不仅要力争煤炭自给，而且还要担负支援其他省、市用煤的光荣任务。
    在焦炭生产方面，从8月份以来，全省已生产焦炭九万二千多吨，比去年全年产量增加127％，全省二千多个炼焦炉70％已投入生产。但是这些成绩和当前钢铁生产的需要还距离很远，因此，各地除了充分发挥现有炼焦炉的作用以外，也要采取“小、土、群”的办法，发动群众分散建立小型土炼焦炉。
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省宝丰县全县五百三十二个小煤窑，在国庆节前后大显威风，从9月25日开始到30日止，平均日产原煤达九千吨。到10月3日，又放出了日产原煤三万零四百四十一吨的“卫星”。
    宝丰县煤炭资源很好，很丰富，群众自古以来就有开采小煤窑的习惯。9月份大办钢铁工业以来，中共宝丰县委为了保证钢铁生产和各方面燃料的需要，充分利用有利条件，确定以“小型为主，土法为主，民办为主”的方针，发动群众大力发展煤炭生产。全县群众自挖的五百三十二个各种类型煤窑，已全部投入生产。从9月8日开始，全县煤炭日产量就由七十吨一跃而达到五千一百三十五吨。以后，直到9月底，小煤窑原煤日产量一直保持在四千吨以上。
    为了解决煤炭生产的技术问题，进一步组织跃进，中共宝丰县委已经集结了五千多个技术员，采取老矿带新矿、大矿带小矿的办法，来提高小煤窑的生产能力。
