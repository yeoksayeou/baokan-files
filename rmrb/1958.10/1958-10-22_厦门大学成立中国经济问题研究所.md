    Xiamen University Establishes
    Institute of Chinese Economic Problems
    The Institute of Chinese Economic Problems at Xiamen University was officially established at the end of last month. It is a research institution directly under the leadership of the General Party Branch and administration of the Economics Department. It will take the study and research of Chairman Mao's economic thought as its guiding principle and will currently focus on studying the economic problems in the socialist revolution and construction of Fujian Province and Xiamen City.

    To celebrate the establishment of the institute, they held a one-day scientific discussion meeting. A total of two hundred papers were submitted for discussion, breaking the record of previous discussion meetings of the Economics Department. The vast majority of these papers are reports and experiences of teachers and students of the department who went to the countryside and factories in the past six months to conduct production practice and investigation research. They also include three revolutionary teaching outlines. Due to time constraints, only three papers were read. President Wang Yanan reported on the outline of his article "Self-Criticism on the Issue of Linking Theory of Political Economy with Practice." The other two were: "Thoroughly Eliminating the Residual Forces of Private Ownership of Means of Production is a Requirement for the Development of Productive Forces" by the Economics 4th student research group, and "Investigation Report on the Establishment of Factories by the Whole People in Xiamen Urban Areas" by Mr. Long Weiyi and Mr. Liu Xijun.

    厦门大学成立
    中国经济问题研究所
    厦门大学中国经济问题研究所已于上月底宣告成立。它是在经济系党总支和行政直接领导下的一个研究机构，将以学习和研究毛主席的经济思想为纲，目前主要研究福建省和厦门市社会主义革命和建设中的经济问题。
    为了庆祝该所成立，他们曾举行了为期一天的科学讨论会。提交讨论的论文共有二百篇，打破了经济系历届讨论会的纪录。这些论文绝大多数是该系师生在最近半年来下乡下厂，进行生产实习、调查研究的报告和体会，还包括三份有革命意义的教学大纲。由于时间限制，只宣读三篇论文。王亚南校长报告了“关于‘政治经济学的理论联系实际问题’的自我批判”一文的提纲。另外两篇是：经四学生研究小组的“彻底消灭生产资料私有制残余势力是生产力发展的要求”和龙维一、刘熙钧先生的“厦门市区街全民办厂调查报告”。
