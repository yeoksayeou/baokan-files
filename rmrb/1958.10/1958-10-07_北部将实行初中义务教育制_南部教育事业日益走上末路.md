Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang dispatch: The fourth session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, at its closing meeting on the morning of October 2nd, passed a decree stipulating that a comprehensive compulsory junior high school education system will be implemented from November 1st of this year.

The decree also stipulates the establishment of technical schools for junior high school graduates, and the implementation of compulsory technical education within the next four to five years. One technical school will be established in every few li (townships) in urban areas, rural areas, fishing villages, and forest areas. Regions with suitable conditions will begin establishing technical schools this year. Each school will establish studios, practice factories, experimental farms, and students will participate in actual production in factories, enterprises, state farms, agricultural cooperatives, and fishing grounds to master technology.

At the meeting, Li Il-kyu, member of the assembly and Minister of Education and Culture, said in his report that the implementation of a comprehensive compulsory junior high school education system is a new stage in the development of people's education, which will comprehensively improve the general cultural and technical level of the working people and further promote the cultural revolution in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th: Seoul report: The education cause in South Korea under US occupation is increasingly heading towards its end. There are now more than 1.22 million out-of-school children in South Korea. Only 10% of this year's university graduates have found jobs.

During the Korean War, 84% of schools in South Korea were destroyed, and many schools were occupied by the US military or the Syngman Rhee puppet army or used as training grounds. After the armistice, the Syngman Rhee clique was eager to expand its army and refused to invest in building schools. At present, schools at all levels in South Korea are short of more than 37,900 classrooms. South Korea is also very short of teachers, with universities alone lacking more than 2,000 teachers. The Syngman Rhee clique also used various excuses to persecute and expel conscientious teachers and close schools at all levels. This year alone, the Syngman Rhee clique ordered the closure of seven universities, including "Kyungsang University," and twenty-six secondary schools. What is worse, the Syngman Rhee clique unscrupulously plundered the blood and sweat of the South Korean people in the name of running education, and increased various school fees year after year. As a result, the South Korean working people, who already find it difficult to feed their families, are unable to afford to send their children to school.

    北部将实行初中义务教育制
    南部教育事业日益走上末路
    据新华社平壤电　朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第四次会议10月2日上午举行的闭幕会议通过了一项法令，规定从今年11月1日起全面实行初中义务教育制。
    法令还规定，建立以初中毕业生为对象的技术学校，在今后的四、五年内实行技术义务教育制。在城市、农村、渔村和林区每几个里（乡）分别建立一所技术学校。有条件的地区从今年开始办技术学校。每个学校要建立工作室、实习工厂、试验田，学生要到工厂企业、国营农场、农业社和渔场去参加实际生产，以掌握技术。
    议员、教育文化相李一卿在会议上作报告时说，实行全面地初中义务教育制，是发展人民教育的新阶段，将全面提高劳动人民的一般文化和技术水平，进一步促进朝鲜的文化革命。
    新华社平壤6日电　汉城消息：在美国占领下的南朝鲜的教育事业日益走上末路。南朝鲜现在共有一百二十二万以上的失学儿童。今年的大学毕业生中只有10％找到了职业。
    朝鲜战争期间，南朝鲜有84％的学校遭到破坏，许多学校被美军或李承晚伪军占据或作练兵场。停战以后，李承晚集团急于扩军，不肯投资兴建学校，现在南朝鲜各级学校共缺少三万七千九百多个教室。南朝鲜师资也很缺乏，各大学就缺二千多名教员。李承晚集团还用各种借口迫害和开除有良心的教师，封闭各级学校。仅在今年，李承晚集团就下令封闭了“庆尚大学”等七所大学和二十六所中等学校。更坏的是，李承晚集团以办教育为名，大肆搜刮南朝鲜人民的血汗，年年增加学校的各种学杂费。这样一来，连养活家口都十分艰难的南朝鲜劳动人民就无力供给子女上学。
