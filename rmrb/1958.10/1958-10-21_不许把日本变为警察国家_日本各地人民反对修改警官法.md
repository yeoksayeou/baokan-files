　　Don't Allow Japan to Become a Police State
　　People in Various Parts of Japan Oppose Revising the Police Officer Law
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th -- According to a report in the "Akahata" today, the regular conference of the Kyushu Regional Headquarters of the Japan Coal Miners' Union, which has more than 100,000 members, unanimously passed a resolution opposing the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" at its closing meeting on the 19th.
　　According to this decision, each coal mine union in Kyushu will hold a 30-minute or longer fixed-time strike every shift change on the 28th, and will hold a 24-hour strike on a certain day in early November. The conference unanimously believes that the Kishida Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law", the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty", and the formulation of "Anti-Espionage Law" are all blatant manifestations of the Kishida Nobusuke government's fascism. Therefore, coal miners must unite to smash these conspiracies.
　　At an emergency meeting of the executive committee held on the 17th, the All Hokkaido Trade Union Council decided to establish a joint struggle liaison council, including the Japanese Communist Party, to oppose the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law", and will hold a national conference on the 28th to prevent the nuclear armament of Japan and to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations. On this day, the All Hokkaido Trade Union will also hold a fixed-time strike.
　　Joint struggle organizations against the revision of the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" with the participation of people from all walks of life will also be established successively throughout Japan.

    不许把日本变为警察国家
    日本各地人民反对修改警官法
    据新华社20日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，拥有十万多会员的日本煤矿工会九州地方总部定期大会在19日的闭幕会议上，一致通过了关于反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的决议。
    根据这个决定，九州各个煤矿工会将在28日每次换班时举行三十分钟以上的定时罢工，并且将在11月上旬的某一天举行二十四小时的罢工。大会一致认为，岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”、日美
  “安全条约”和制定“防谍法”等，都是岸信介政府法西斯化的露骨表现。因此，煤矿工人必须团结起来，粉碎这些阴谋。
    全北海道工会协议会在17日举行的执行委员会紧急会议上决定，将成立包括日本共产党在内的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”共同斗争联络协议会，并且将在28日举行阻止核武装日本和打开日中关系僵局的国民大会。在这一天，全北海道工会还将举行定时罢工。
    日本各地也将相继成立有各阶层人民参加的反对修改“警察官职务执行法”共同斗争组织。
