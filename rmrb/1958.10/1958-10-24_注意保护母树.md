    Pay Attention to Protecting Mother Trees

    Now is the season when seeds of various trees are ripening. Our Mayan Township in Huixian County, Gansu Province, is currently carrying out a large-scale seed collection campaign in order to prepare sufficient seeds and seedlings for the greening of the motherland. We have specially organized student seed collection teams and livestock feeder seed collection groups, and widely mobilized commune members to make concentrated efforts to collect seeds during breaks in busy farming periods. However, in some places, the protection of mother trees is insufficient during seed collection. When collecting seeds of lacquer trees and Armand pines, some people use sickles to cut off all the branches of the mother trees, turning them into bare poles. Some individual commune members even simply cut down the mother tree from its roots before collecting the seeds. This practice is very wrong. It is suggested that the leaders of our township immediately correct this erroneous behavior, and we hope that all localities will educate the masses to pay attention to protecting mother trees when collecting tree seeds.

    注意保护母树
    现在，正是各种树木种籽成熟季节。我们甘肃徽县麻沿乡，为了给绿化祖国准备充足的种籽和树苗，目前正在开展着大规模的采种运动。专门组织了学生采种队和饲养员采种组，并广泛发动社员利用农忙空隙时间突击采种。但是，有的地方在采种中，对母树保护不够。在采集漆树、华山松的种籽时，有的人用镰刀把母树的枝条全部砍掉，变成了一棵光杆子。甚至有个别社员，干脆从母树根部砍倒，然后再采树籽。这种做法是非常错误的。建议我乡领导上能立即纠正这种错误行为，并望各地教育群众，在采集树种时，应注意保护母树。
