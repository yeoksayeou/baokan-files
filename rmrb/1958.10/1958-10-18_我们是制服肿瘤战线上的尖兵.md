    We are the Pioneers on the Frontline of Conquering Tumors
    Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Youth Tumor Control Shock Brigade

    We, eleven communist party members, communist youth league members and some active young people from the Department of Pathology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, formed a tumor assault team before "July 1st" to be the pioneers in tumor control research.

    To welcome this year's "July 1st", the youth assault team and the young comrades of the Pathology Department Youth League branch proposed to conduct a major review of all 150,000 cases of surgical living tissue examinations preserved by the Pathology Department of the Academy of Medical Sciences from 1917 to this year within ten days before "July 1st", and select all Chinese tumor cases from them (a total of 27,150 cases) to identify the tumors that are most harmful to the people. All tumors will be classified and statistically analyzed according to type, location, gender, and age to provide valuable data for future tumor research work. After this battle slogan was put forward, the experts were surprised. Some professors said: "I have had this idea for a long time, but I didn't dare to think about such a huge project in the past, let alone propose it..." This work received the support of the Party, which provided assistance in terms of manpower and material resources. Even the secretary of the Party branch personally participated in the specific work and fought alongside the young comrades.

    In this work, our young comrades, in order to show their love for the Party, were determined to present a gift before "July 1st". The comrades patiently and carefully went through the accumulated old data page by page, working day and night. Some comrades sat down and worked continuously for four or five hours. Some comrades gave up eating, some comrades slept in the office, and some comrades insisted on working hard despite being ill. During the most intense days of battle, dozens of comrades fought through the night without rest.

    Under the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the comrades, this task was overfulfilled in eight days. After this battle, the comrades proposed further battles and organizational adjustments, because the Tumor Research Committee of the whole academy has been established at this time. It is necessary for the Youth Assault Team to become a youth organization for the whole academy. This suggestion was supported by the Party Committee. After the active youths of all major departments (pathology, biochemistry, experimental morphology, tumor hospital, internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, radiology, pharmacobotany, antibiotics) of the whole academy formed the Youth Assault Team, they immediately proposed a proposal to the national youth—to offer treasures, prescriptions, and ideas for the five-year tumor control plan. The comrades realized that research work cannot be carried out alone in the laboratory, and it must be combined with the power and wisdom of the broad masses of the people to achieve something. In particular, efforts should be made to combine research work with traditional Chinese medicine to achieve something. After this proposal was put forward, it received the concern and support of young people from all over the country. They wrote letters one after another, some sending the traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions they knew, some sending their experience, some sending their proposals and ideas, and more people writing to tell about the pain of themselves or their relatives suffering from cancer, and eagerly looking forward to our research results. This gave us great encouragement and impetus.

    In order to pay tribute to the Party and to "October 1st", the comrades of the assault team and the Youth League branch of the Department of Pathology also proposed to work hard and practically for fifteen days using spare time (spare time refers to 7 pm to 11 pm, and spare spare time refers to time after 11 pm) to study and analyze all cervical cancer cases (2,023 cases) diagnosed and treated by our hospital in the past forty years from clinical, pathogenic factors, and pathological morphology. Because cervical cancer is the first major fortress of cancer. Among the 84 cancer cases we counted, cervical cancer accounted for 54%. However, there are no complete and detailed literature materials on this cancer, which is most harmful to the people, in our country, and there is even less large-scale statistical analysis and morphological research. This proposal received strong support from the Party. Under the direct and specific leadership of the Party, and with the participation of all comrades of the Department of Pathology and comrades of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a large-scale assault work began again. We showed greater revolutionary vigor than the previous time. Many comrades fought hard while sick. Some comrades had a fever but did not let others know. During the half-month, comrades often slept at one or two o'clock at night. During the most intense time, we fought through the night. Under the leadership of the Party and with the efforts of all young comrades, we finally completed this arduous task in fourteen days, statistically analyzing a large number of valuable materials on pathogenic factors, clinical symptoms, and curative effects, and put forward our own opinions. The young people relied on the Party, using careful research and a large number of facts to smash the Brodres morphological classification method that has been used for decades, proving that this classification method is completely divorced from clinical practice and has no effect on prevention and treatment, and with the spirit of daring to think and act, put forward a new morphological classification method for clinical reference. Facts have proved that this new method is superior to the old method.

    There was resistance to carrying out this work. Some professors said at the beginning, "This work is meaningless and will not produce any results," and were indifferent to this work; some professors not only did not support it during the most intense battle, but also wanted to pull people out; some professors convened the most meetings and arranged heavy work, which inevitably dispersed the strength of the assault team at the most tense moment. But the young comrades, with the support of the Party, did not care about these things, and we continued to do it. In the research process, when the young comrades began to propose new attempts at classification methods, some professors immediately denied it, and the young people once wavered, but under the encouragement of the Party, they used a large number of facts and careful research to finally put forward a new method for clinical reference.

    At the final thesis discussion meeting, some professors did not carefully observe the charts we made, and repeatedly nitpicked. Some professors were originally dissatisfied with the Brodres classification method, but strangely, they repeatedly held on to the Brodres classification at the discussion meeting, expressed doubts about the breaking of the Brodres classification, and put forward a series of "unexcludeable" factors, which the young comrades answered one by one with facts.

    In this assault, the main force was the young people, and the achievements were made under the leadership of the Party rather than under the leadership of the professors. Through this work, the young people fully realized their strength. We broke the superstition of professors, broke the mysterious view of scientific research, and further realized the importance of breaking superstition called for by the Party.

    In the future, the comrades of the assault team will regularly talk to each other about the problems existing in the tumor research of each department, as well as the problems existing in the coordination and cooperation of each department and the problems on the two roads, and promptly discover the situation and report it to the Party organization and the Tumor Research Committee, as an active assistant for tumor research in the whole academy. The Youth Assault Team has sent representatives to participate in the Standing Committee of the Tumor Committee of the whole academy, and will continue to be pioneers and assault soldiers in the struggle of "five-year tumor control".

    我们是制服肿瘤战线上的尖兵
    中国医学科学院青年制服肿瘤突击队
    我们医学科学院病理学系共产党员、共青团员以及一部分积极的青年群众十一个人，为做制服肿瘤研究的尖兵，在“七一”前成立了肿瘤突击队。
    为迎接今年的“七一”，青年突击队和病理学系团支部的青年同志们，提出要在“七一”以前十天内，把医学科学院病理系自1917年至今年的四十年中，所保存的全部十五万例外科活体组织检查，来一个大清查，把其中全部中国人的肿瘤病例挑出来（共二万七千一百五十例），找出危害人民最大的肿瘤。并将全部肿瘤按种类、部位、性别、年龄加以统计，给今后肿瘤研究工作提供宝贵的资料。这个战斗口号提出后，专家们都表示吃惊，有的教授说：“我早就有这个意思，但这样巨大的工程过去我不敢去想，更不敢提出来……”这一工作得到了党的支持，从人力物力上给以各方面的帮助。甚至党支部书记还亲自参加了具体工作，和年青同志们一起苦战。
    我们青年同志们在这一工作上为了表现对党的热爱，一定要在“七一”以前献上礼，同志们耐心细致地一页不丢地翻遍了堆集着的老资料，不分昼夜地干，有些同志一坐下来就连干四、五小时，有些同志放弃了吃饭，有些同志睡在办公室里，有的同志生了病仍坚持苦干。在战斗最紧张的日子，数十位同志通夜不息地大战通宵。
    在党的领导与同志们的努力下，在八天内就超额完成了这项任务。这场战斗后，同志们提出进一步的战斗，并进行组织调整，因这时全院的肿瘤研究委员会已经成立。青年突击队有必要成为全院性的青年组织。这个意见得到了党委的支持。全院各主要科系（病理、生化、实验形态、肿瘤医院、内、外、妇、放射、药植、抗生素）的积极青年组成了青年突击队后，马上就向全国青年提出倡议——为五年制服癌瘤献宝、献方、献计。同志们认识到，研究工作不能关在实验室内单独进行，必须和广大人民的力量与智慧结合起来才能有所成就。尤其是努力将研究工作和中医中药结合起来才能有所成就。这个倡议提出后，就得到了各地青年的关心与支持，他们纷纷来信，有的把自己所知道的中医药方寄来，有的把自己的经验寄来，有的把自己的倡议、想法寄来，而更多的人写信诉说自己或亲人受癌瘤危害的痛苦，迫切期待着我们的研究成果。这给我们很大的鼓励与推动。
    为了向党向“十、一”献礼，突击队和病理学系团支部的同志们又倡议，用业余的业余时间（业余时间指晚七点至十一点，业余的业余时间指夜十一点以后的时间）苦干实干十五天，把我院四十年来所诊断及治疗过的全部子宫颈癌（二千零二十三例）从临床、发病因素及病理形态等各方面加以研究分析。因为子宫颈癌是癌瘤的第一大堡垒，在我们所统计的八十四例癌瘤病例中，子宫颈癌占54％。但对这一危害人民最大的癌瘤，我国还没有完整、详细的文献材料，大量的统计分析及形态学研究更是没有。这一倡议得到了党的大力支持，在党的直接又具体的领导下，在病理系全体同志及妇产科放射科同志的参加下，大规模的突击工作又开始了。我们拿出比前次更大的革命干劲，许多同志带病苦战，有些同志发烧但不让别人知道，半月中同志们经常是夜间一两点才睡，最紧张的时候大战通宵。在党的领导下，在全体青年同志的努力下，我们终于在十四日内完成了这一艰巨的任务，对发病因素、临床症状、疗效等，统计分析了大量可贵的材料，并提出了自己的看法。青年人依靠了党，用细心的钻研，用大量的事实，粉碎了沿用数十年的Brodres氏形态分类方法，证明这一分类方法是完全脱离临床实际的，对预防及治疗是不起什么作用的，而且用敢想敢干的精神，提出了可供临床参考的新的形态分类方法，事实证明了这新的方法比之旧方法是优越的。
    进行这一工作不是没有阻力的，有的教授一开始就说“这工作没有什么意思，不会出什么结果”，而对这一工作表示冷淡；有的教授在战斗最紧的时候，不但没有支持而且想向外拉人；有些教授召集开会最多，布置工作也繁重，这不能不在最紧张的时刻分散了突击队的力量。但青年同志在党的支持下没有管这些，我们干下去。在研究过程中，当青年同志开始提出新的分型方法的尝试时，又有些教授马上加以否定，青年们一时也曾发生了动摇，但在党的鼓舞下，又用大量的事实，细心的钻研，终于提出了可供临床参考的新方法。
    在最后的论文讨论会上，有些教授并没有对我们做的图表进行详细的观察，就一再挑剔。有的教授原来就是对Brodres分类法不满意的，但奇怪的是在讨论会上一再抱住Brodres分类不放，对Brodres分类之被打破表示怀疑，提出了一连串“不能排除”的因素，这些问题青年同志却用事实一一作了回答。
    在这次突击中，主力是青年人，所取得的成就也是在党的领导下而不是在教授领导下取得的，通过这次工作，青年们充分认识了自己的力量，我们破除了对教授的迷信，打破了科学研究神秘的观点，更深一步体会到党所号召的打破迷信的重要性。
    突击队的同志们今后将定期在一起互相交谈各科在肿瘤研究问题上存在的问题，以及各科在协调合作上所存在的问题及两条道路上的问题，及时发现情况，反映给党组织及肿瘤研究委员会，作全院肿瘤研究的积极助手。青年突击队已派代表参加全院肿瘤委员会常委会，要在“五年制服癌瘤”的斗争中，不断地做好尖兵和突击手。
