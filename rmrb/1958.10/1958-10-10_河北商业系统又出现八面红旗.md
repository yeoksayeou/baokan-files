Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th: Following the emergence of fourteen red flags in the first half of the year, eight more red flags have recently emerged in Hebei Province's commercial system.

The eight red flags are: Wu'an County's "one-stop" cotton purchase, storage, and transportation, which creatively solved the contradictions of insufficient labor, warehouse equipment, and transportation capacity in cotton purchase work by relying on the masses, laying a solid foundation for doing a good job in cotton purchase, storage, and transportation. The Shulu County Daily-Use Industrial Products Management Department comprehensively adjusted the relationships between all aspects, both above and below, left and right, and implemented a "one-stop" large-scale collaboration for the supply of industrial products. The Tianjin Special District commercial departments carried out a mass movement to collect scrap steel to support the ascent of the Steel Marshal. The Tianjin retail service industry extensively carried out the "Five Satisfactions" movement to better serve consumers. The Zhangbei County commercial departments cooperated with relevant departments to establish a health and medical network, a livestock disease prevention and control network, and a pharmaceutical supply network throughout the county to ensure strong people and horses. The Tianjin No. 2 and No. 3 Food Processing Plants made full use of pig, cattle, and sheep by-products to extract high-grade medicines and valuable industrial raw materials, turning discarded materials into priceless treasures. In addition, there are the Tianjin Heping Road Department Store and Dingzigu Workers' New Village Retail Store, which rely on employees and residents to implement "two participations and one reform" and "three participations and one reform."
