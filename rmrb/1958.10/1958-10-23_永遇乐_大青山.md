Yong Yule
Great Green Mountain
Lü Zhengcao
Before the Great Green Mountain, how many heroes of ancient and modern times have been reviewed. At Baideng, flaunting military might, and Liu Che sending troops far away, who can judge their merits and demerits? Genghis Khan, a peerless hero, was nothing more than riding horses and hunting. Look at today, the Mongol and Han people are of one heart, repainting the colors of heaven and earth. Strive, Great Green Mountain, to repay us in time, and do not waste your years. Bring favorable winds and rain, melt sand and snow, and offer coal and iron. Gardens, pavilions, and ponds, with flowers in clusters, create a picturesque world. Let Wang Zhaojun forget her sorrows, and West Lake lose its splendor.

    永遇乐
    大青山
    吕正操大青山前，阅过多少，古今豪杰。白登耀武，刘彻穹兵，功罪凭谁说。盖世英雄，成吉思汗，无非走马射猎。看今朝，蒙汉同心，重染天地颜色，勉尔青山，及时报效，且莫虚度岁月。顺风调雨，销沙溶雪，献出煤与铁。园林池榭，花团锦簇，妆成图画世界，管教那，王嫱忘情，西湖失色。
