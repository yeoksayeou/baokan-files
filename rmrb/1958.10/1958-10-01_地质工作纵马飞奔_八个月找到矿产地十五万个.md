Our nation's geological work, astride the leaping Great Leap Forward steed, has released a bountiful "satellite" this year. According to incomplete statistics, from January to August this year, 154,000 mineral deposits have been found in the nationwide prospecting and exploration efforts. This is equivalent to two and a half times the total number of mineral sites found nationwide during the entire First Five-Year Plan (44,000).

Of the more than 11,000 mineral sites that have undergone preliminary inspection and evaluation, there are more than 500 large mines of various minerals. The prospects for mineral resources have expanded unprecedentedly. 140 large iron ore deposits with proven and prospective reserves ranging from around 100 million tons to over 10 billion tons have been found. These large iron ore deposits are distributed in 24 provinces and autonomous regions. Dozens of large copper deposits have been found, as well as dozens of large aluminum deposits. Large coalfields have also continuously emerged in Guangdong, Fujian, Hubei and other provinces that previously lacked coal, as well as the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province. Guangdong Province alone has known coal reserves of several billion tons. Other mineral resources have also seen significant discoveries.

It is estimated that the completed Class I reserves of various major minerals this year will exceed the original national plan by several to dozens of times. Among them, iron ore reserves will increase by 3.5 times compared to the original plan; copper ore by 3.4 times; aluminum ore by 3.9 times; coal by 1.6 times; phosphate rock by 3 times; and the urgently needed iron ore and nickel ore will increase by 38 times and 11 times respectively, which is 11 times and 19 times more than the total reserves proven during the First Five-Year Plan.

The bumper harvest of mineral resources provides material strength for the Great Leap Forward in industry, with steel as the key link, and the widespread development of small and medium-sized enterprises across the country.

    地质工作纵马飞奔
    八个月找到矿产地十五万个
    本报讯　跨上跃进骏马的我国地质工作，今年放出了丰产大“卫星”。据不完全统计，今年1月至8月，全国普查找矿中已找到矿产地十五万四千个，相当于第一个五年计划期间全国找到的矿点总和（四万四千个）的二倍半。
    经过初步检查评价的一万一千多个矿点中，各种矿产的大矿就有五百个以上。矿产的远景空前地扩大了。已找到的远景储量在一亿吨左右到一百亿吨以上的大铁矿有一百四十个，这些大铁矿分布在二十四个省和自治区中；已找到的大铜矿产地有几十个；大铝矿产地几十个。原来缺煤的广东、福建、湖北等省和甘肃省河西走廊，也不断出现了大煤田，仅广东省已知的煤矿远景储量就有数十亿吨。其他各种矿产也都有重大的发现。
    预计今年完成的各种主要矿产，一级储量，比国家原来批准的计划超过几倍到几十倍，其中铁矿储量将比原计划提高三点五倍；铜矿三点四倍；铝矿三点九倍；煤矿一点六倍；磷矿三倍；国家急需的铁矿和镍矿分别提高三十八倍和十一倍，比第一个五年计划期间探明的总储量还多十一倍和十九倍。
    矿产资源的大丰收，给我国以钢为纲的工业的大跃进和中小型企业的遍地开花提供了物质力量。
