The Crystallization of Cooperation Between Tsinghua University and Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant
Electron Computer Program-Controlled Milling Machine Successfully Made

(Reported by this newspaper) A program-controlled vertical milling machine, entirely designed and manufactured with domestically produced materials and controlled by an electronic computer, has been initially successfully trial-produced through the cooperation of Tsinghua University and Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. This marks the beginning of China's machinery industry moving towards a high degree of automation.

Electron computer program-controlled machine tools represent cutting-edge technology that has only been developed in the world in recent years, and only a few countries have successfully trial-produced them.

This type of program-controlled machine tool adopts high-speed computing electronic technology, thus revealing the brilliant prospect of a high degree of automation in mechanical processing. An advanced electronic computer can control dozens of machine tools to process simultaneously, becoming a highly automated mechanical processing workshop or factory. If the existing program-controlled machine tools are further combined with radio wave transmission technology, remote control operations can be performed using radio wave transmission methods. Sitting in Beijing, one can direct the production of mechanical processing workshops in Xinjiang, Guangzhou, and other places.

The United States took four years to trial-produce such a program-controlled machine tool, and Britain took two and a half years, while a group of teachers and young students at Tsinghua University, with an average age of only twenty-four, under the leadership of the Party and with the cooperation of relevant units, successfully trial-produced it in only eighty-odd days. After visiting, Soviet expert Chiledin, Dean of the Moscow Power Institute, gave it a high evaluation. He said that your independent trial-production of this cutting-edge product proves that China's scientific work is advancing alongside the most advanced countries in the world. A Soviet expert from Huazhong Institute of Technology also highly praised this brand-new achievement. However, at the beginning of the design, the teachers and students only had one page of relevant information and a schematic diagram. During the manufacturing process, they encountered failure after failure; the hydraulic motor part alone failed more than sixty times. Because they were not afraid of difficulties and failures, they finally achieved success by relying on collective strength. On the wall of their workshop is pasted Marx's famous saying: "Only those who are not afraid of hardship in climbing the rugged path have hope of reaching the brilliant peak." This is their motto.

In the process of trial production, in addition to the Party organizations at all levels of the school, the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China gave them tremendous encouragement and specific assistance. Responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee went to the workshop several times to understand the production situation and provide specific guidance. When they lacked experienced fitters, they immediately sent experienced fitters to Tsinghua University to help them solve key problems. Many units, even when their own tribute tasks were very tight, tried their best to help solve material and technical force problems. For example, when special bearings were lacking, Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Plant opened its warehouse to help them find them. All of this is the basic situation that enabled the program-controlled machine tool to be made at high speed. This program-controlled milling machine officially underwent a test run at 11:00 p.m. on September 29th. The teachers and students used it to conduct machining tests of plane rhombuses, three-dimensional rhombuses, and plane circles on several castings, and the performance was good. In order to apply this machine tool to production, there are still a series of problems (such as improving machining accuracy, the durability of the electronic computing system, etc.) that need to be solved.

### 清华大学和北京第一机床厂合作的结晶  电子计算机程序控制铣床制成

    清华大学和北京第一机床厂合作的结晶
    电子计算机程序控制铣床制成
    本报讯　全部用国产材料自行设计和制造、用电子计算机控制的程序控制立式铣床，已在清华大学和北京第一机床厂合作下初步试制成功。这是我国机械工业走向高度自动化的开端。
    电子计算机程序控制机床是世界上近几年才发展起来的尖端技术，只有少数几个国家试制成功。
    这种程序控制机床采用了高速计算的电子技术，这样就揭示了机械加工高度自动化的光辉远景。一台高级的电子计算机可以控制几十台机床同时进行加工，成为一座高度自动化的机械加工车间或工厂。如果进一步把现有的程序控制机床和无线电波传递技术结合起来，就可以用无线电波传递的方法作远距离的控制操作。坐在北京可以指挥新疆、广州等地机械加工车间的生产。
    试制这样一台程序控制机床，美国共用了四年时间，英国用了两年半的时间，而清华大学的一群平均年龄只有二十四岁的教师和青年学生，在党的领导下和各有关单位的协作下，只用了八十多天的时间就试制成功了。苏联莫斯科动力学院院长奇列金专家参观以后给予很高的评价。他说，你们能独立地试制成这种尖端产品，证明中国的科学工作已经同世界上最先进的国家并驾齐驱地前进着。来自华中工学院的一位苏联专家也十分赞赏这项崭新的成就。但是，师生们在设计开始时，只有一页有关资料和一张示意图。制造时遇到一次又一次的失败，液动机部分就失败过六十多次。由于他们毫不惧怕困难和失败，终于依靠集体力量获得了成功。在他们的车间的墙上贴着马克思的名言：“只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”这就是他们的座右铭。
    在试制过程中，除学校各级党组织外，中共北京市委给了他们巨大的鼓舞力量和具体帮助。市委负责同志曾几次到车间了解生产情况，进行具体指导。当他们缺少老钳工时，就立刻派老钳工到清华大学帮助他们解决关键问题。很多单位即使在自己献礼任务非常紧张的情况下，也尽力帮助解决材料和技术力量问题。如缺少特种轴承，北京第二机床厂就打开仓库帮助他们找。这一切都是程序控制机床能够高速度制成的基本情况。这台程序控制铣床已于9月29日晚十一时正式进行试车，师生们用它在几块铸模上作了平面菱形、立体菱形和平面圆形的加工试验，性能良好。为了将这种机床运用到生产中去，还有一系列的问题（如提高加工的精密度，电子计算系统的持久耐用等）需要解决。（附图片）
