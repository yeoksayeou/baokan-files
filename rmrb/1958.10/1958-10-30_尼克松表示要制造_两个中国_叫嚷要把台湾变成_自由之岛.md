    Nixon Expresses Desire to Create "Two Chinas"
    Vowing to Turn Taiwan into a "Free Island"
    According to a report by "Washington Post" reporter Roberts, on October 22, Nixon, at a press conference in Hartford, Connecticut, in the northeastern United States, replied to his question, saying that the United States' goal in the Far East crisis was to make Formosa "a free island" rather than "linking American policy with Chiang Kai-shek."
    Roberts further quoted Nixon as saying that it was necessary to establish an independent Chinese government that could allow twelve million Formosans and millions of overseas Chinese to "express their loyalty." Nixon said that if Formosa becomes a stronghold for freedom-loving Chinese, overseas Chinese, who play a pivotal role in some Southeast Asian countries, would not have to pledge their allegiance to the Chinese Communist regime on the mainland.
    Nixon said, "As long as it is not maintaining Chiang Kai-shek's symbol on the island of Formosa, but more importantly maintaining a symbol of a free government, then it can maintain the hope that the Communist Party's eternal rule over the mainland is not inevitable."
    Reporter Roberts also explained when reporting Nixon's remarks at the press conference that this statement "once again shows the government moving towards a 'two Chinas' policy and is an extension of Secretary of State Dulles' remarks at the press conference on September 30."
    Roberts reported that some of Nixon's aides later explained that Nixon's remarks were "not undermining Chiang Kai-shek" but rather showing that the government does not link its entire policy with one person. The government is trying to look beyond Chiang Kai-shek and support a free Formosa in the long-term future.

### 尼克松表示要制造“两个中国”  叫嚷要把台湾变成“自由之岛”

    尼克松表示要制造“两个中国”
    叫嚷要把台湾变成“自由之岛”
    据美国“华盛顿邮报”记者罗伯茨报道，10月22日尼克松在美国东北部的康涅狄格州哈特福德的记者招待会上答复他的问题说，美国在远东危机中的目的是使福摩萨成为“一个自由之岛”而不是“把美国的政策同蒋介石连结起来”。
    罗伯茨进一步引用尼克松的话说，有必要成立一个可以使一千二百万福摩萨人和成百万华侨“表示忠心”的独立中国政府。尼克松说，如果福摩萨成为爱好自由的中国人的堡垒，在某些东南亚国家举足轻重的华侨就勿须使自己忠于大陆的中国共产党政权。
    尼克松说，“只要不是在福摩萨岛上保持着蒋介石的象征，更重要的是保持一个自由政府的象征，那就能够保持这样的希望：共产党对大陆的永远统治并不是不可避免的。”
    记者罗伯茨在报道尼克松在记者招待会上的谈话时还解释说，这番话“又一次表明政府朝着‘两个中国’政策前进，并且是对国务卿杜勒斯9月30日在记者招待会上的谈话的引伸。”
    罗伯茨报道，尼克松的一些助手随后解释说，尼克松讲这些话“不是拆蒋介石的台”，而是表明政府不把它的整个政策同一个人联系起来。政府是试图把眼光放到比蒋介石更远的地方，支持长远将来的一个自由的福摩萨。
