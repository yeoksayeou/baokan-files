Simple Construction, Heat Preservation and Cold Protection, Excellent Iron Production
Yuxian Underground Native Furnace "Cheap and Good"
    (Our newspaper, Yuxian, 9th dispatch) In the great battle for steel, the Fangshan First Iron Smelting Plant in Yuxian County, Henan Province, has created a "underground native furnace group" that is quick to build, saves labor, uses no iron, uses no blue bricks, and uses few refractory bricks. A three-meter-high furnace can produce 700 to 1,500 catties of iron per day and night. A group of six furnaces, driven by one blower, can produce up to four and a half tons of iron per day.
    These underground furnace groups are all excavated using weirs with low water levels. Six or seven can be dug on a row of weirs, each dug three meters deep from top to bottom. The diameter of the furnace throat is 40 cm, gradually widening downwards. The distance from the furnace throat to the furnace waist is 150 cm, and the diameter of the furnace waist is 50 cm; the distance from the furnace waist to the furnace belly is 50 cm, and the diameter at the furnace belly is the largest, at 65 cm; the distance from the furnace belly to the furnace bottom is 55 cm, the furnace bottom diameter is 60 cm, and the bottom depth is 45 cm. The inner wall of the furnace body should be lined with a layer of refractory mud about 5 cm thick. The furnace bottom is made of 50 refractory bricks. From the longitudinal section of the furnace, it looks a bit like an ordinary shaped vase. Behind the furnace, a one-meter-wide ventilation ditch is dug, with the bottom of the ditch about one foot higher than the furnace bottom. The air inlet is circular, next to the bottom of the ditch, and connected to a blower by an air inlet pipe.
    This type of furnace has been tested and identified as having ten major advantages. (1) It makes use of the natural terrain by building the furnace on the weir, which is suitable for the characteristics of mountainous areas. (2) It is quick to build, and four people can excavate one in a day. However, building a Yangcheng-style blast furnace requires two hundred workers working overnight for ten days. (3) It saves funds: each furnace only requires 50 refractory bricks, more than 200 catties of refractory mud, and four man-days, costing about 12 yuan. Compared with the original three-meter-high furnace, it saves 850 refractory bricks, 975 blue bricks, and reduces labor by 176 man-days; it reduces equipment costs by more than 50 times. (4) The furnace construction technology is simple, easy to understand, and easy to learn. (5) The production efficiency is high, and each furnace can produce half a ton of iron per day and night. (6) The quality of the iron is good. (7) The operation is simple and relatively safe. When adding materials, there is no need to go on the rack, just stand on the earthen wall of the furnace; only four people are required to operate the furnace, weigh materials, and add materials, while a Yangcheng-style blast furnace generally requires eleven people. (8) The furnace has a long lifespan. Preliminary tests show that one lining of the furnace can smelt for 48 hours, which is about twice as long as the original native blast furnace's smelting time of 24 hours. Under normal production conditions, it is estimated that it can produce 338 days per year. (9) It can keep warm, which can solve the problem of native furnaces in winter. (10) It is easy to protect against rain.
    Since the three-meter underground native furnace group was put into production, the Fangshan First Iron Smelting Plant has discovered some shortcomings of this batch of furnace groups. The main ones are that the furnace wall is thin, and cracks easily occur if the iron smelting time is too long. It is easy to collapse after being exposed to the sun and rain; the five-centimeter-thick layer of refractory mud on the inner wall of the furnace body is too thin and easily peels off. Recently, when building the five-meter underground furnace group, they paid attention to improving the above shortcomings. The furnace wall was thickened to one meter, the interval between the two furnaces was two meters, and the refractory mud on the inner wall of the furnace body was thickened to one decimeter.
    The underground native furnace group was created in Yuxian's launching of the first steel satellite. The underground native furnace group played a powerful role in Yuxian's first release of a large satellite producing 4,000 tons of iron per day, creating a record of producing 1,100 catties of iron per furnace per day.

### 构造简单　保温防寒　出铁优良  禹县地下土炉“价廉物美”

    构造简单　保温防寒　出铁优良
    禹县地下土炉“价廉物美”
    本报禹县9日电　河南省禹县方山第一炼铁厂在钢铁大战中，创造了一种建炉快、省工、不用铁、不用青砖，少用耐火砖的构造简单的“地下土炉群”。一座三公尺高的一个炉子一昼夜能产铁七百斤到一千五百斤，一群六个炉子由一个鼓风机带动，日产铁最多可以达到四吨半。
    这种地下炉群都是利用水位低的堰棱来挖凿的。在一溜堰棱上可以挖上六、七个不等，每个从上向下挖凿三公尺深。炉喉的直径是四十公分，往下逐渐扩大，炉喉到炉腰处距离是一百五十公分，炉腰的直径为五十公分；从炉腰到炉腹距离是五十公分，炉腹处直径最大，为六十五公分；炉腹到炉缸处距离为五十五公分，炉缸直径为六十公分，缸深四十五公分。炉身内壁要搪上约五公分厚的一层耐火泥。炉缸用五十块耐火砖砌成。从炉子的纵剖面来看，有点像一只普通形状的花瓶。炉背后，开凿一条一公尺宽的通风沟，沟底高于炉底一尺左右。进风口是圆形，挨着沟底，由进风管连在一个鼓风机上。
    这种炉子经过试验鉴定，有十大优点。（一）利用自然地形，把炉子建在堰棱上，适合山区的特点。（二）建炉快，四个人一天就可以挖凿一个。而建立一个阳城式高炉，二百个工连夜干，还要十天功夫。（三）节省资金：每建成一个炉子只要五十块耐火砖、二百多斤耐火泥、四个人工，约需十二元多钱。较原建三公尺高炉节约耐火砖八百五十块，青砖九百七十五块，减少人工一百七十六个；降低了设备费五十多倍。（四）建炉技术简单，一听就懂，一看就会。（五）生产效率高，一昼夜每炉可以生产铁半吨。（六）铁的质量好。（七）操作简单，也比较安全，添料时不必上架，站在炉壁土墙上就行；看炉、磅料、添料等只要四人操作，而阳城式高炉一般要十一个人。（八）炉子寿命长，经初步试验，搪一次炉子可以熔炼四十八个小时，比原土高炉一次炼二十四小时，提高了一倍左右。在正常生产情况下，每年估计能生产三百三十八天。（九）能保温，可以解决土炉过冬问题。（十）雨天防备容易。
    从三公尺地下土炉群投入生产以来，方山第一炼铁厂已经发现这一批炉群的一些缺点，主要是炉壁较薄，炼铁时间过长容易裂缝，日晒雨淋后容易塌陷；炉身内壁五公分厚的一层耐火泥太薄，容易剥落。最近，他们在建造五公尺地下炉群时，就注意改进了以上缺点，炉壁加厚到一公尺，两炉间隔就有二公尺，炉身内壁的耐火泥加厚到一公寸。
    地下土炉群是在禹县放射第一颗钢铁卫星中创造出来的。地下土炉群在禹县第一次放出日产铁四千吨的大卫星中，发挥了强大的威力，创造了每炉日产铁一千一百斤的纪录。　（张丽君）
