   Our Workshop
   Beijing Jade Grinding Female Worker Zhong Huiqiong, Poem and Painting
   Our workshop, whoosh whoosh whoosh,
   Rows of champions wearing red flowers.
   Housewives compete in enthusiasm,
   Leaving the kitchen, stepping out of the home.
   Master craftsmen patiently pass on their skills,
   Apprentices learn attentively and carefully,
   This painting is realistic,
   We grind jade and carve jade.
   Carving parrots spreading green wings,
   Carving goldfish flashing red skirts,
   Carving frogs playing with lotus leaves,
   Carving peacocks spreading their tails wide.
   Grinding and grinding, chipping and chipping,
   Jade that is unworked, is nothing made.
   Artworks exchanged for steel,
   To build communism. (Attached picture)

   我们的车间
   北京磨玉女工　钟惠琼　诗并画
   我们车间哗哗哗，
   行行状元带红花。
   家庭妇女比干劲，
   离开锅台走出家。
   老师傅耐心传手艺，
   徒弟用心仔细学，
   这张画儿是写实，
   我们磨玉又琢玉。
   琢成鹦鹉张绿翅，
   琢成金鱼闪红裙，
   琢成青蛙戏荷叶，
   琢成孔雀大开屏。
   磨呀磨，劈呀劈，
   玉不琢，不成器。
   艺术品去换钢铁，
   来建设共产主义。（附图片）
