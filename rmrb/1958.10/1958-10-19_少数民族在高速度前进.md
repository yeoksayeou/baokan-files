    Minority Nationalities Are Advancing at High Speed
    Since last winter, inspired by the general line of socialist construction, the tens of millions of people of minority nationalities in our country, together with the Han people, have displayed soaring enthusiasm and created many miracles. The remarkable achievements of the people of Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi are one of the many red flags in the high-speed construction of minority nationality areas. The United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site observation meeting on ethnic work there, which is of great significance for accelerating socialist construction in minority nationality areas.
    Sanjiang is a "barren mountainous area" with "high mountains and cold water," and can be said to be a relatively backward area among the minority nationalities in the country. The ethnic relations there are relatively complex. Land reform was completed in 1954 through peaceful consultation. Although grain production has increased year by year, some areas still use backward methods such as people pulling plows, hoeing fields, and foot-weeding, resulting in very low yields and a large annual grain shortage. Since last year, the Sanjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has led the vast number of farmers in carrying out rectification and socialist debates, and has achieved a great victory in the struggle against rightists and the criticism of local nationalism. This is the fundamental key to Sanjiang's realization of the socialist Great Leap Forward, and it is a turning point for the people of all nationalities in Sanjiang to rapidly change their backward outlook and build socialism. The victory of this struggle rapidly raised the socialist consciousness of the people of all nationalities and eliminated all kinds of special theories and backward theories. Under the slogan of "Changing the mountains to surpass the plains," the people of the county mobilized together, overcame the poor mountains and evil waters, and finally achieved a great harvest of early rice. The output of early rice increased more than nine times compared with last year, making it the first county with a yield of over 1,000 jin of early rice in minority nationality areas, and transforming it from a severely grain-deficient county into a grain-surplus county. At the same time, under the guidance of the principles of self-raised funds, self-supplied raw materials, self-taught technology, and simultaneous preparation, construction, and production, Sanjiang's industry established more than 4,000 large and small factories, a surge of more than 600 times compared with before the Great Leap Forward. These tremendous achievements further eliminated all pessimistic views and enhanced the confidence of cadres and the masses in building socialism through self-reliance.
    The remarkable achievements Sanjiang has made in such a short period powerfully illustrate a fact: minority nationality areas are fully capable of carrying out socialist construction at high speed, just like other regions of the country. Countless facts have proven that our general line of socialist construction not only conforms to the situation and requirements of the Han areas, but also fully conforms to the situation and requirements of the minority nationality areas. Now, the Han areas are undergoing an all-round Great Leap Forward, and many minority nationality areas are also undergoing an all-round Great Leap Forward. Areas with slower progress are also striving to catch up quickly, accelerate construction, and strive to eliminate the backward state of economic and cultural development left over from history as soon as possible.
    The question of whether minority nationalities can carry out socialist construction at high speed is essentially a question of whether or not to implement the general line. In the short span of a few years, under the leadership of the Party, more than 90% of the minority nationality population has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Some of these nationalities have leaped from feudalism, slavery, or even primitive commune systems, skipping one or several stages of social development, to socialism. At present, some originally quite backward minority nationalities have established people's communes in "one step" at the same time as achieving victory in the democratic revolution. Minority nationalities have not only achieved a tremendous leap forward in the socialist revolution, but they are also fully capable of achieving a Great Leap Forward in production and construction. The summer grain crops in minority nationality areas have generally achieved high yields; the net increase rate of livestock in pastoral areas is growing rapidly at a rate several times higher than in the past; the mass movement for running industries by the whole people is surging, and even nationalities that did not even have handicraft workshops in the past are now running iron and steel industries on a large scale; nationalities that originally lived a backward fishing and hunting life have also established processing factories; some nationalities are building people-run railways; and some nationalities that originally did not have a single school have eliminated illiteracy using their own languages or Chinese. Miracles are countless.
    There should be no doubt that minority nationality areas will definitely be able to carry out socialist construction at the highest speed. However, exploiting class elements and their spokespersons, as well as local nationalist elements, often use this kind of special theory and backward theory as a "basis" to try their best to spread pessimism and fatalism among the people of all nationalities, weakening people's revolutionary will. They also seize on individual shortcomings in their work, exaggerate them, and attempt to negate the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, oppose socialist construction in minority nationality areas, and oppose minority nationalities taking the socialist road. The people of all nationalities must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against this vicious conspiracy of the reactionary classes and give them a resolute blow in a timely manner.
    At the same time, in our ranks, there are still a very few people who, to this day, still use "minority nationalities are backward," "customs are special," "ethnic relations are complex," "natural conditions are poor," and other special theories and backward theories as excuses to draw the wrong conclusion that the production and construction of minority nationalities cannot develop rapidly. When observing issues in minority nationality areas, these people with right-leaning conservative ideas often one-sidedly emphasize backward and unfavorable factors, and ignore or obliterate favorable and positive factors. Therefore, in their view, it is simply impossible for minority nationality areas to achieve a leap forward. We do not deny that minority nationality areas have difficult conditions such as relatively backward economic and cultural development and a relatively weak foundation. However, it should be recognized that the minority nationality areas are "poor and blank," as Chairman Mao said: "These may seem like bad things, but in fact they are good things. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, the desire to work, the desire for revolution. A blank sheet of paper has no burdens and is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for painting the newest and most beautiful pictures." Backwardness not only cannot hinder the Great Leap Forward of minority nationalities, but precisely because their economic and cultural development is relatively backward and their lives are not yet prosperous, they are even more eager to carry out socialist construction at the highest speed. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of minority nationalities for this Great Leap Forward is precisely a huge potential that is invincible and can overcome all obstacles. Like the Han working people, the working people of our country's minority nationalities are industrious and brave. Minority nationality areas are rich in resources and have infinite potential, and after nine years of work, a good foundation has been laid for the Great Leap Forward of construction. What is particularly worth mentioning is that their construction is not isolated, but is carried out under the close care of the Party and the state, and under the communist great collaboration of the people of the whole country regardless of nationality or region, which is an extremely favorable factor. The problem lies in mobilizing the masses. If we fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, we believe that the working people can liberate themselves, and the labor enthusiasm and collective wisdom of the broad masses can move mountains and overturn seas.
    At present, the people of all nationalities are being encouraged by the situation of the national Great Leap Forward, and by the victories they have achieved. Under the guidance of the slogan "Learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and catch up with the Han people with the help of the Han people," they are striving to realize their ambitious plans to catch up with the level of the Han people. We believe that under the brilliant light of the general line, the people of all minority nationalities in our country will definitely be able to accelerate the speed of economic and cultural construction, and realize their great ideals in not too long a time.

### 少数民族在高速度前进

    少数民族在高速度前进
    去冬以来，我国几千万少数民族人民同汉族人民一道在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，发挥了冲天干劲，创造了许多奇迹。广西三江侗族自治县人民所获得的显著成果，就是少数民族高速度建设中的许多面红旗之一。中共中央统战部最近在那里召开了民族工作现场观摩会议，这对加快少数民族地区的社会主义建设，有着重大的意义。
    三江是“山高水冷”的“贫瘠山区”，在全国少数民族当中，可以说是一个比较落后的地区。那里的民族关系比较复杂，1954年通过和平协商的方式完成了土地改革，虽然粮食产量年年有所增加，但是部分地区还是采用人拉犁、锄挖田、脚耘田等落后方法进行生产，产量很低，每年缺粮数量比较大。去年以来，中共三江县委领导广大农民进行了整风和社会主义大辩论，并且取得了反右派斗争和批判地方民族主义的伟大胜利。这是三江实现社会主义大跃进的根本关键，是三江各民族人民迅速改变自己的落后面貌、建设社会主义的转折点。这一场斗争的胜利，迅速提高了各民族人民的社会主义觉悟，打掉了各种各样的特殊论和落后论。他们在“改变山区，赛过平原”的口号下，全县人民一齐动员起来，战胜了穷山恶水，终于获得了早稻大丰收。早稻的产量比去年增加九倍多，成为全国少数民族地区的第一个早稻千斤县，从严重的缺粮县一跃而为余粮县了。与此同时，三江的工业在资金自筹、原料自备、技术自学和边筹、边建、边生产的方针指导下，建立了大小工厂四千多个，比大跃进前猛增六百多倍。这些巨大的成就，进一步扫除了一切悲观论调，提高了干部和群众自力更生建设社会主义的信心。
    三江在短短的时期内，取得这样显著的成就，有力地说明了一个事实：少数民族地区完全可能同全国其他地区一样，高速度进行社会主义建设。无数的事实证明，我国社会主义建设总路线不仅符合汉族地区的情况和要求，也完全符合少数民族地区的情况和要求。现在，汉族地区正在全面大跃进，许多少数民族地区也在全面大跃进，进展比较迟缓的地区也在努力急起直追，加速建设，争取早日消灭历史上遗留下来的经济文化发展上的落后状态。
    少数民族是不是能够高速度进行社会主义建设的问题，实质上是要不要贯彻执行总路线的问题。短短的几年来，90％以上的少数民族人口，在党的领导下，已经取得了社会主义革命的决定性胜利。其中有些民族是从封建制度、奴隶制度甚至是原始公社制度，超越了一个或几个社会发展阶段，跃进到社会主义的。目前，有些原来相当落后的少数民族，在取得民主革命胜利的同时，就“一步登天”地建立了人民公社。少数民族不但在社会主义革命中实现了巨大的跃进，在生产和建设中也完全能够实现大跃进。少数民族地区的夏粮普遍获得高额丰产；牧业区的牲畜纯增率正以高于过去几倍的速度飞快增长；全民大办工业运动正在高涨，甚至原来连手工业工场也没有的民族，也都在大办钢铁工业；原来过着落后渔猎生活的民族也建立了加工工厂；有的民族在兴建民办铁路；有些原来没有一所学校的民族，已经用本民族的文字或者用汉文扫除了文盲。奇迹不可胜数。
    少数民族地区必定能够用最高的速度来进行社会主义建设，这应该是没有疑问的了。但是剥削阶级分子及其代言人和地方民族主义分子，也往往以这种特殊论落后论作为“根据”，在各民族人民中竭力散布悲观论和宿命论，削弱人们的革命意志。他们还抓住在工作中的个别缺点，加以夸大，企图否定大跃进的成绩，反对在少数民族地区进行社会主义建设，反对少数民族走社会主义道路。对于反动阶级的这种恶毒阴谋，各民族人民必须经常保持高度警惕，及时给予坚决的打击。
    同时，在我们的队伍中，也还有极少数人，至今仍然以“少数民族落后”、“风俗习惯特殊”、“民族关系复杂”、“自然条件差”等等特殊论和落后论为借口，得出少数民族的生产和建设不能迅速发展的错误结论。这些有右倾保守思想的人，在观察少数民族地区问题时，往往片面强调落后的不利的因素，忽略或抹煞有利的积极的因素。因此，在他们看来，少数民族地区简直无法跃进。我们不否认，少数民族地区存在经济文化比较落后、基础比较薄弱等困难条件。但是，应该认识到，少数民族地区“一穷二白”，正如毛主席所说的：“这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命，一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”落后不但不能妨碍少数民族大跃进，而恰好是由于他们的经济文化发展比较落后，生活还并不富裕，所以就更加迫切地要求以最高的速度进行社会主义建设。广大少数民族群众这种要求大跃进的积极性，正是战无不胜、攻无不克的巨大潜力。我国少数民族的劳动人民和汉族劳动人民一样，是勤劳勇敢的。少数民族地区资源丰富，潜力无穷，而且经过九年来的工作，已经为建设事业的大跃进打下了良好的基础。特别值得提出的是：他们的建设不是孤立的，而是在党和国家的密切关怀下，全国人民不分民族、不分地区的共产主义大协作下进行的，这是极为有利的因素。问题在于发动群众，如果我们把群众的积极热情充分发挥起来，相信劳动人民能够自己解放自己，广大群众的劳动热情和集体智慧就可以移山倒海。
    目前，各民族人民正在为全国大跃进的形势所鼓舞，为自己取得的胜利所鼓舞，他们在“学先进，赶先进，在汉族的帮助下赶上汉族”的口号指引下，正在为实现他们制定的赶上汉族水平的宏伟规划而奋斗。我们相信，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我国各少数民族人民一定能够加快经济文化建设的速度，用不着很长的时间就可以实现伟大的理想。
