Qinghai's agriculture and animal husbandry have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests this year. Total grain production has increased by 134% compared to last year, averaging 470 jin per mu, crossing the Yellow River nine years ahead of schedule. The Saishike Farm on the eastern edge of the Qaidam Basin launched a national wheat yield champion "satellite," with a yield of 8,585 jin per mu of spring wheat. Total rapeseed production increased by 70% compared to last year, averaging 130 jin per mu. The rapeseed grown at the Delingha Farm harvested 2,161 jin of rapeseed per mu, winning the national rapeseed high-yield first place. The number of various livestock is expected to reach 20 million head, up from over 17.17 million head last year. Averaged across the population, the province has 1,300 jin of grain per person. The pastoral population averages about fifty head of livestock per person.

The decisive factor for Qinghai's great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production this year is the implementation of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism. This spring, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the fighting program of "hard struggle for five years to change the face of Qinghai." Cadres at all levels and farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups throughout the province were greatly encouraged. They broke with the "Qinghai backwardness theory" and were determined to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural and animal husbandry production and catch up with advanced regions. On the basis of improved class consciousness, the vast majority of herdsmen joined cooperatives this summer. Through debate, they cleared away the ideological obstacles of "livestock production cannot leap forward." The Provincial Party Committee tightly grasped the technical aspects of agricultural and animal husbandry production. At the beginning of spring plowing, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the yield-increasing measures of "one water, two fertilizers, three techniques." Later, it held on-site conferences on water conservancy, fertilizer, field management, tool reform, etc., and specifically organized cooperation between urban and rural areas, between mountains and plains, and between townships and communes, so that various technical tasks could keep up accordingly. The pastoral areas also adopted a series of production-increasing measures, such as large-scale construction of grassland water conservancy and improvement of grazing systems.

Qinghai Province has great potential for agricultural and animal husbandry production. The existing cultivated land area is 8 million mu, with each agricultural laborer cultivating an average of more than 10 mu of land. However, the current cultivated land only accounts for a very small part of the province's arable land. According to the data from the already surveyed areas, there are 15 million mu of arable wasteland suitable for farming. The crop yields here are very high, especially in some newly reclaimed areas. The national high-yield champions for wheat and rapeseed last year and this year both came from here. The eastern agricultural area has very fertile land. Both high mountains and plains are suitable for growing crops. Farmers grow wheat on the plains, highland barley in the mountains, and rapeseed can also be grown on the mountaintops. The pastoral areas are also lush with water and grass. The pasture grass is generally five inches to one foot high and suitable for reclamation as a feed base. Using only the currently available grasslands for grazing, at least 80 million head of livestock can be raised.

At present, all 1.4 million farmers of all ethnic groups in the province have joined the people's communes, and the vast numbers of herdsmen are also actively organizing people's communes to make all preparations for a greater harvest next year.

### 青海粮食产量跨过黄河  牧业人口每人平均有牲畜五十头

    青海粮食产量跨过黄河
    牧业人口每人平均有牲畜五十头
    本报讯　青海省的农业牧业今年获得了空前大丰收。粮食总产量比去年猛增一点三四倍，每亩平均达到四百七十斤，提前九年过了黄河。在柴达木盆地东沿的赛什克农场，放出了全国小麦丰产冠军的大卫星，他们的一亩春小麦产量达到八千五百八十五斤。油菜籽总产量比去年提高70％，平均每亩产量一百三十斤。德令哈农场种的油菜，有一亩收获菜籽二千一百六十一斤，荣获全国油菜高产第一名。各种牲畜预计可由去年的一千七百一十七万多头达到两千万头。如果按照人口来平均，全省每个人可有粮食一千三百斤。牧业人口每个人可有牲畜五十头左右。
    青海今年农牧业生产大跃进的决定因素是贯彻执行了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的结果。今年春天，中共青海省委提出了“苦战五年、改变青海面貌”的战斗纲领，全省各级干部和各族农牧民都受到极大鼓舞，他们打破“青海落后论”，决心要在农牧业生产上争取丰收，赶上先进地区。牧民群众在阶级觉悟提高的基础上，绝大部分今年夏天加入了合作社，并通过辩论，扫清了“畜牧业生产不能跃进”的思想障碍。在农牧业生产上省委抓紧了技术一关。春耕开始时，中共青海省委就提出了“一水二肥三技术”的增产措施，以后又召开了水利、肥料、田间管理、工具改革等方面的现场会议，具体组织了城乡之间，山川之间，乡与乡、社与社之间的协作，使各项技术工作相应地赶上去。牧区也采取了一系列的增产措施，如大修草原水利、改善放牧制度等。
    青海省农牧业生产的潜力很大。现有耕地面积八百万亩，每个农业劳动力平均要耕种十亩多地，但目前耕地还只占全省可耕地的极少部分。根据已经勘察的部分地区的资料，就有宜农的可垦荒地一千五百万亩。这里的农作物产量很高，特别是一些新垦地区，去年和今年的小麦、油菜全国高产冠军都出在这里。东部农业区土地很肥沃，高山和平川都好种庄稼，农民在川地种小麦，山地种青稞，山顶上还可以种油菜。牧业区也水草丰美，牧草一般高在五寸到一尺，而且适宜开垦作为饲料基地。仅用目前可以利用的草原放牧，就至少可以饲养牲畜八千多万头。
    目前，全省一百四十万各族农民已经全部加入了人民公社，广大牧民也正积极组织人民公社，为明年更大丰收作好一切准备。
