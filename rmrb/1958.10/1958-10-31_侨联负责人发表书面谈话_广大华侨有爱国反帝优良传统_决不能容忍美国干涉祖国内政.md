Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese today issued a written statement supporting Minister Peng Dehuai's "Second Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan."

The spokesperson said: Minister Peng Dehuai's "Second Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan" addresses the issue of overseas Chinese, pointing out their responsibility and role in accomplishing the great cause of the motherland's reunification.

The spokesperson for the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese further elaborated: Overseas Chinese have a fine tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism. For more than forty years, from the Xinhai Revolution to the present, overseas Chinese have actively participated in and supported the motherland's revolutionary movements, and have been concerned about the motherland's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The vast majority of overseas Chinese have united under the banner of patriotism; from their own experiences, overseas Chinese have realized that the independence, strength, and prosperity of the motherland are the reliable guarantee for the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

The spokesperson said: The older generation of overseas Chinese Kuomintang figures can recall that in the past thirty years of history, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have cooperated twice to deal with the common enemy and achieved success. Today, the problem is again the problem of a major enemy in front of us. The Americans are plotting to create "two Chinas," on the one hand interfering in our internal affairs and provoking our country, directly threatening the happy lives of the people of the motherland and their families. Our government has issued forty serious warnings to the United States. This is truly unbearable! On the other hand, since the Dulles-Chiang talks, the situation of the Taiwan authorities has become even more dangerous. The Americans in Taiwan are bossing people around, issuing orders, and openly stating that the use of Chiang Kai-shek is all based on American interests, not allowing the Taiwan authorities to intervene in anything, scolding Chiang Kai-shek as stupid, forcing the Taiwan authorities to feel ashamed and become a laughing stock internationally. A feeling of confusion, bitterness, sadness and indignation is hard to conceal even in the Taiwan newspapers. This means that Dulles' first move, "isolating Taiwan," has begun to be implemented. As for the second step, "trusteeship of Taiwan," kicking Chiang Kai-shek aside, is also being implemented. The tragic situation of the Taiwan authorities, facing storms and precariousness, is already very clear. Zhang Zuolin's fate should serve as a warning.

The spokesperson concluded: "Harmony is the best policy," "Patriotism unites us all," "Patriotism knows no precedence," and "There is a way out for all patriots." These are the policies that our government has long announced. The Taiwan authorities should make a choice as to what to do. The vast masses of patriotic overseas Chinese, returned overseas Chinese, and relatives of overseas Chinese have expectations for the Taiwan authorities. There are many patriotic people in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and few who are willing to be American slaves. We hope that the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, as well as overseas Chinese abroad, will unite with the people of the motherland to jointly smash the schemes of American imperialism.

    侨联负责人发表书面谈话
    广大华侨有爱国反帝优良传统  决不能容忍美国干涉祖国内政
    新华社29日讯　中华全国归国华侨联合会发言人，今日发表书面谈话，拥护彭德怀部长“再告台湾同胞书”。
    发言人说：彭德怀部长“再告台湾同胞书”中谈到了海外华侨的问题，指出了华侨在完成祖国统一大业上的责任和作用。
    全国侨联发言人进一步阐述说：华侨是有反帝爱国的优良传统的，从辛亥革命至今四十多年以来，华侨积极参加和支持祖国的革命运动，关怀祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，绝大多数华侨在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来；广大华侨从切身经历中体会到，祖国的独立、强盛和繁荣，才是华侨正当权利和利益的可靠保证。
  这位发言人说：老一辈的华侨国民党人士都能回忆：在过去三十多年历史中，国共两党曾经两次进行合作，以对付共同的大敌，取得成效。今天的问题又是大敌当前的问题。美国人要制造“两个中国”的阴谋，一方面干涉我国内政，对我国进行挑衅，直接威胁祖国人民和侨眷的幸福生活，我国政府已向美国提出了四十次严重警告，真是是可忍，孰不可忍。另一方面，自杜蒋会谈后，台湾当局的处境也更危险了。美国人在台湾颐指气使，发号施令，公开声明对于蒋介石的使用，一切以美国的利益为依归，事事不容台湾当局插嘴，辱骂蒋介石为愚蠢，迫得台湾当局无地自容，在国际上成为笑柄。徬徨苦闷，悲哀愤懑之情，连台湾报刊也难以遮掩了。这就是说，杜勒斯的第一步棋“孤立台湾”已见实行。至于第二步“托管台湾”，把蒋介石一脚踢开的做法，也在施展中。台湾当局风雨飘摇，朝夕难保的悲惨局面，已经看得很清楚。张作霖的下场，应可作为殷鉴。
    发言人最后说：“和为上计”，“爱国一家”、“爱国不分先后”，“一切爱国者都有出路”，这是我国政府早经宣布了的政策。何去何从，台湾当局应该有所抉择。广大爱国华侨、归侨、侨眷对于台湾当局寄予期望。台、澎、金、马爱国的人多，甘心做美国奴隶的人少。我们希望台、澎、金、马同胞及国外侨胞和祖国人民团结一致，共同粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。
