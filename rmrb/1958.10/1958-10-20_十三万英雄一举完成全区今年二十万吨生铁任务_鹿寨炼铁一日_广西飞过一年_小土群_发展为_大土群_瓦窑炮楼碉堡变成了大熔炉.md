Xinhua News Agency, Liuzhou, 19th - Guangxi's Luzhai County has released an extremely inspiring, nationally record-breaking pig iron satellite. This county produced 200,7243 tons of pig iron in one day, from 2 PM on the 17th to 2 PM on the 18th. It also produced 288,139 tons of sintered iron. The county's one-day output equals the state's entire annual task assigned to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

This high-yield record has been verified by the Luzhai group of the Autonomous Region Party Committee inspection team, the branch team of the Prefectural Committee inspection team, and the Luzhai County Party Committee inspection team. After the event, the County Party Committee's Iron and Steel Office made a detailed verification, proving the output to be accurate and the quality of the pig iron to meet national standards.

The fundamental reason why Luzhai County was able to launch such a large high-yield satellite is that it fully mobilized and relied on the masses, truly forming a mass movement for large-scale iron and steel production. Before this great battle, the county conducted a mass mobilization of the entire population and launched a grand debate on "Why fight the Red October battle? Can the annual task be completed this month?" Through the grand debate, it resolved the negative thinking of "only seeing immediate interests and not long-term interests; only seeing difficulties and not seeing favorable conditions," making the economic and political significance of large-scale iron and steel production more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The steel field army surging to the front line increased sharply from the original 46,000 to 110,000. At the same time, it also received strong support from 27,000 people from Liujiang, Rongan, Shilong Counties, and the Damiaoshan Miao Autonomous County. They fought side by side, and after seven days and nights of hard work, built 8,316 new iron smelting kilns, and stockpiled more than 849,000 tons of iron ore and more than 1,493,000 tons of fuel, preparing sufficient material conditions for the great satellite launch.

The main experience of Luzhai County in launching high-yield satellites is to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, change small iron smelting kilns into large kilns, and widely use old brick and tile kilns, lime kilns, pillboxes, and bunkers for iron smelting. The newly built iron smelting kilns have an average capacity of 50 tons, and the largest reaches 15,300 tons. Among them, there are 553 kilns with 100 to 500 tons, 498 kilns with 500 to 1,000 tons, 167 kilns with 1,000 to 5,000 tons, and 11 kilns with 5,000 to 10,000 tons. These large kilns are easy to operate, and the mixing method is basically the same as that of native blast furnaces, so the masses can learn it at a glance. The advantage of large kilns is that the temperature is concentrated and high, and the output is high. Generally, the production of good iron is about 50%, which can save a lot of labor compared with small native blast furnaces. Therefore, the steel fighters said: "We are engaged in 'large native clusters'." Luzhai County is rich in iron ore with a grade of up to 60% or more, and is widely distributed. Eighteen of the county's twenty-three townships have iron ore. Some townships also have coal. The newly built large, medium, and small iron smelting kilns are all distributed in places with ore and fuel, making it very convenient to obtain materials locally. In this way, the four elements of mining, coal mining, iron smelting, and transportation are combined, greatly reducing the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity. At the same time, in terms of production management, they adopted a responsibility system of assigning tasks at all levels, setting quotas for contracting, and setting deadlines for completion, which more powerfully guaranteed the completion of production tasks. In order to quickly launch this satellite into the sky, all twenty-one people's communes in the county closely cooperated and concentrated their efforts to support eight iron smelting bases. Five communes, including Zhaisha and Toupai, had no iron smelting tasks, so the commune members cut wood and burned charcoal to ensure supply to the front line. Four hundred and eighty carpenters in the county worked hard for seven days and seven nights, rushing to make more than 1,000 bellows and more than 1,000 wooden carts, which were quickly transported to the iron smelting site. When the masses in Luzhai Town saw trucks and ox carts carrying materials across the Luoqing River, the ferry was slow and affected production, so they picked wood and materials and fought for four days and nights, building a floating bridge more than 200 meters long on the Luoqing River, which had never had a bridge in history, making the transportation army supporting the front line unimpeded.

### 十三万英雄一举完成全区今年二十万吨生铁任务  鹿寨炼铁一日　广西飞过一年  “小土群”发展为“大土群”　瓦窑炮楼碉堡变成了大熔炉

    十三万英雄一举完成全区今年二十万吨生铁任务
    鹿寨炼铁一日　广西飞过一年
    “小土群”发展为“大土群”　瓦窑炮楼碉堡变成了大熔炉
    新华社柳州19日电　广西鹿寨县放出了一颗极为振奋人心的全国最大的生铁卫星，这个县在17日下午二时到18日下午二时的一天内，生产出生铁二十万零七千二百四十三吨；另产烧结铁二十八万八千一百三十九吨。这个县一天的产量，就等于今年国家分配给广西僮族自治区的全年任务。
    这一高产纪录经过自治区党委检查团鹿寨组、地委检查团分团，以及鹿寨县委检查组逐一鉴定研究，事后又经过县委钢铁办公室的详细核对，证明产量属实，生铁质量也合乎国家规定的标准。
    鹿寨县所以能够放出这样大的高产卫星，根本原因是充分发动群众，依靠群众，真正形成了群众性的大办钢铁的运动。在这场大战前夕，这个县曾进行了全民性的大动员，开展了“为什么要大战红十月，本月份能不能完成全年的任务”的大辩论。通过大辩论，解决了“只看到眼前利益，不看长远利益；只看到困难，看不到有利条件”的消极思想，使大办钢铁的经济和政治意义更加深入人心，全县涌上前线的钢铁野战军由原来的四万六千人，猛增到十一万人。同时，又得到了柳江、融安、石龙县和大苗山苗族自治县的两万七千人的大力支援。他们并肩作战，经过七昼夜的苦战，新建了八千三百十六个炼铁窑，储备了八十四万九千多吨铁矿石和一百四十九万三千多吨燃料，为大放卫星准备下了充足的物质条件。
    鹿寨县大放高产卫星的主要经验，是集中了群众的智慧，把小炼铁窑改为大窑，并广泛利用旧的砖瓦窑、石灰窑、炮楼、碉堡等来炼铁。新建的炼铁窑平均每个容量为五十吨，最大的达一万五千三百吨。其中，一百吨至五百吨的有五百五十三个，五百吨至一千吨的有四百九十八个，一千吨到五千吨的有一百六十七个，五千吨到一万吨的有十一个。这些大窑操作简单，配料方法也与土高炉基本上相同，因此群众一见就会。大窑的好处是温度集中、温度高，产量高，一般产好铁在50％左右，比小土高炉能节省很多人工。因此，钢铁战士说：“我们这是搞‘大土群’。”鹿寨县铁矿丰富，品位高达60％以上，而且分布很广，全县二十三个乡就有十八个乡有铁矿。有的乡还有煤炭。新建的大中小炼铁窑，都分布在有矿石有燃料的地方，就地取材很方便。这样，就使挖矿、挖煤、炼铁、运输四者结合起来，大大减少了运输力量不足的困难。同时，在生产管理方面，他们采取了层层分任务、定额包干、限期完成的责任制，更加有力地保证了生产任务的完成。为了很快地把这颗卫星发射上天，全县二十一个人民公社密切协作，集中力量支援八个炼铁基地。寨沙、头排等五个公社没有炼铁任务，社员们就伐木烧炭，保证供应前方。全县四百八十个木匠苦干了七天七夜，赶制出一千多座风箱和一千多座木车，迅速运到炼铁工地。鹿寨镇群众见到汽车、牛马车载运物资过渡洛清江时，渡船往返很慢，影响生产，就拣木拣料，连战四昼夜，在历史上从未搭过桥的洛清江上搭起了一座二百多公尺长的浮桥，使支援前线的运输大军畅行无阻。
