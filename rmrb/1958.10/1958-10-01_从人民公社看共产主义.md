    Viewing Communism from the People's Commune
    Wu Chuanqi
    The surging people's commune movement is developing vigorously throughout the country, and is about to be completed. The rapid development of the people's communes is the result of the current rapid development of productive forces in our country urgently requiring corresponding relations of production. The development from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes is another change of production relations with great historical significance in the process of China's "continuous revolution." Therefore, people call it "taking it to the next level."
    Since the great leap forward by the whole people, production on all fronts of industry and agriculture has leaped forward by multiples, several times, dozens of times, and labor productivity has leaped forward by multiples, several times, dozens, hundreds, and thousands of times. This vigorously developing productive force is the result of the liberation of people's minds; at the same time, it is also a driving force for the emergence and growth of new relationships. For the progress of socialist construction in our country, on the one hand, it marks that our socialist construction has entered a new stage of accelerated development, predicting that industrial and agricultural production in our country will achieve more vigorous development; on the other hand, it makes the six hundred million people in our country clear about the direction of further development and find a concrete path to the radiant communist society.
    Compared with agricultural cooperatives, the superiority and most essential characteristics of the people's communes are "first, large, and second, public." Therefore, it can meet the objective requirements of the current further development of productive forces. The so-called "large" means more people, more land, greater strength, and more comprehensive business operations, which can be said to be a change in quantity. The so-called "public" means more collectivized and more socialistic, which can also be said to be a change in quality. The people's commune is not only the best organizational form for accelerating the building of socialism, but also the best transitional form for moving towards a completely "selfless" communist society. The communist sprouts contained in the people's commune are inherent in this general trend of increasingly developing towards "great public-spiritedness and selflessness."
    Socialism and communism are the same type of society, a process of development from a primary to an advanced stage. The arrival of communist society is the inevitable trend of socialist construction. Socialist construction is the necessary preparation for moving towards communism. But the two also have clear differences. Marx took the principles of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" and "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" as scientific markers to distinguish between the two stages. The establishment of the people's commune, of course, does not mean that it has already been changed to ownership by the whole people, let alone entered the communist society of "to each according to his needs." In nature, it is still socialist. However, it has already appeared in our actual life in a budding state, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    The communist sprouts that appear in our real life can be initially explored from the following aspects.
    First, under the socialist system, there are still two types of socialist ownership, namely, collective ownership of the means of production and ownership by the whole people. Socialist collective economy is a necessary stage for the transition from individual economy to the economy of the whole people, and it is only a transitional economic form. Therefore, it has incomparable advantages over the original individual economy. However, since these agricultural cooperatives are generally small in scale and have a narrow scope of operation, they are increasingly unable to meet new requirements with the rapid development of production. After the implementation of merging large cooperatives and transforming them into communes, not only the contradictions of the original agricultural cooperatives were overcome, but also the collective economy of the people's communes was closely combined with the state-owned economy at the township and county levels, and began to break through the boundaries between the two socialist ownerships. At present, except for a small number of people's communes that have begun to implement ownership by the whole people, the vast majority are still under collective ownership. But it has already taken a big step towards ownership by the whole people, and it already contains several components of ownership by the whole people. The trend of development shows that it can generally transition to ownership by the whole people in about three or four years, or five or six years. The transition from collective economy to the economy of the whole people is also one of the basic tasks of transitioning from the primary stage of communism to the advanced stage, and this new economic form means that it begins to lead to the complete elimination of class differences.
    However, merely realizing this condition does not mean entering communist society. "Transitioning to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industry, is still socialist in nature, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." ("Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas") Therefore, we must also look at some other conditions.
    Second, to realize the transition to communism, it is necessary to further eliminate the "old-style division of labor" left over from the old society for thousands of years. For the realization of communist society, Engels said: "The old mode of production should be completely changed, especially the old division of labor should be eliminated." (Anti-Dühring) Eliminating the old mode of production is the task of the socialist revolution. As for the "old-style division of labor," this is the old social division of labor characterized by the separation between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. The victory of the socialist revolution eliminated the antagonism between them, but had to retain the significant differences between them. The existence of this difference is the root cause of the "inequality" that can remain in socialist society. Therefore, further eliminating the "old-style division of labor" characterized by this difference, and completely eliminating this difference, is one of the most fundamental tasks for transitioning to communism.
    In our country, in terms of narrowing the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, the process of this development has been accelerated since the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the "three simultaneous development" policy. For example, since Lushan County in Henan Province started to run industries on a large scale in March this year and implemented the integration of agriculture and industry, the industrial output value may greatly exceed the agricultural output value by the end of this year. The initiative of 500 million peasants running industries on a large scale is rapidly changing the backwardness of rural areas, and will also rapidly change the differences between the original industrial cities and agricultural villages, and between advanced cities and backward villages. In terms of narrowing the differences between mental and physical labor, since the Party put forward the policy of the whole people running education, implemented the combination of education and labor production, cadres participating in labor, etc., a gratifying new communist atmosphere has already appeared in this regard. Now, secondary education has been universally developed in the vast rural areas, technical education and scientific research that are completely integrated with industrial and agricultural production have been universally carried out, and red and expert universities have been established; at the same time, a movement of everyone engaging in inventions, everyone creating miracles, artisans writing books, peasants writing theoretically, workers and peasants studying philosophy, and residents studying philosophy has been launched. There are also schools running factories, factories running schools, and the implementation of "two participations and one reform" in factories, which gradually eliminates the boundaries between workers, intellectuals, and cadres. All of these are new trends towards communism, and they are all sprouts of communism. All these forms of development have been consolidated and established organizationally with the establishment of the people's communes. The people's commune implements the combination of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers," "going to the fields as peasants, entering the factories as workers," "intellectualizing workers and peasants, and laborizing intellectuals," cultivating new people who are both laborers and intellectuals; and with the realization of rural industrialization, gradually breaking down the boundaries between urban and rural areas, this is the specific way to eliminate the "old-style division of labor." Eliminating the "old-style division of labor" is the most profound revolution, the final liberation of mankind, and at the same time, the elimination of the final source of human "inequality." Therefore, the combination of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers" not only accelerates the current socialist construction, but is also a great sprout of communism.
    Third, the remnants of bourgeois rights of "inequality" that reflect the above differences are one of the "traces" of the old society that still have to be retained under the socialist system. Lenin once said that in the first stage of communism, "bourgeois rights" have not been completely abolished, but only partially abolished, only within the scope of the economic reform that has been achieved, that is, only with respect to the relations of the means of production. (State and Revolution) Therefore, in some other aspects, it is still the regulator of the distribution of products and the distribution of labor among the members of society. "To each according to his work" is opposed to the bourgeois "no work, no gain," and is a socialist principle, but it is still a "bourgeois right." Because, it is equal in terms of obtaining equal remuneration for equal amounts of labor; however, unequal people receive equal remuneration, which means inequality in enjoyment. This situation is compatible with a certain level of production development, the existence of differences between workers and peasants, the existence of differences between mental and physical labor, the state of people's ideological awareness, and so on. Therefore, with the high-speed development of production, gradually abolishing the remnants of bourgeois rights, gradually replacing them with communist principles, and until the implementation of "to each according to his needs," is the fundamental task of moving towards communism.
    With the establishment of the people's communes, first of all, many communes with qualified conditions have implemented the grain supply system, or the food supply system, or the basic needs of life supply system. Some implement "seven guarantees" or "ten guarantees": that is, guarantees for food, clothing, housing, education, medical treatment, funerals, haircuts, watching operas, heating fees, and marriage expenses, etc. This supply system, of course, has not reached the communist "to each according to his needs," but it completely breaks through the legal boundaries of "to each according to his work," is suitable for the requirements of further development, and has developed forward in terms of "public," so it should belong to the scope of communism and is a sprout of communism.
    More importantly, in our real life, both in cities and villages, regardless of the boundaries of counties, townships, communes, and mountainous areas and plains, communist large-scale cooperation and large-scale voluntary labor are developing day by day, and on this basis, great miracles of production and construction are constantly being created. That is to say, among the broad masses of working people, the voluntary labor that does not count the relationship between "labor" and "remuneration," the selfless and selfless labor, is developing universally in urban and rural areas. Life itself is constantly destroying the remnants of the old laws. This development demonstrates the great communist brilliance, which should be continuously promoted and carried forward.
    As a remnant of bourgeois rights retained in the socialist system, it is opposed to the bourgeois "no work, no gain," but at the same time, it is also adapted to a certain level of production and social conditions. Therefore, "to each according to his work" can only be a transitional principle of distribution, and should be understood as a "shortcoming" of the new society, but also an unavoidable process. It is not to be continuously strengthened, but to gradually weaken its role. In fact, with each step forward in socialist construction, it will inevitably be replaced by communist principles.
    Fourth, after the establishment of the people's communes, in order to further liberate productive forces and develop productive forces, the policy of "organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization" has been universally implemented. This means an increase in labor productivity and the more rapid creation of communist living conditions. It also marks the completely equal communist relationship between people. At the same time, it makes the people's commune not only the organizer of production, but also the organizer of life.
    The collectivization of life is a great revolution in the lives of peasants. Many places have implemented dining in canteens, happiness for the elderly, nursery care for children, socialization of housework, and socialization of youth education, all of which are basic measures to create communist living conditions. Lenin once regarded "public canteens," "nurseries," "kindergartens," and the socialization of youth education as specimens of communist sprouts. Because this new development first completely liberates women, and finally liberates women from trivial housework, truly realizing equality between men and women, which is true communism. Secondly, it will inevitably break through the family as a socio-economic unit and liberate people from the narrow life of small families. On this basis of development, the new communist style of "everyone for me, I for everyone," and "not only loving one's own parents, not only loving one's own children" will inevitably be cultivated.
    Finally, the people's commune implements the integration of townships and communes, becoming a unified entity of politics, economy, military affairs, and culture and education, which means a major change in the superstructure of socialism in terms of grassroots political power. Obviously, it is more in line with the requirements of consolidating and developing the socialist economic base. But as for the transition to communism, Engels once said: "The administration of people will be replaced by the administration of things and the guidance of the production process." (Anti-Dühring) Therefore, for the grassroots organizational units of the future society, the people's commune is a transitional form to realize such a transition. Therefore, it also contains the sprouts of communism.
    The above and other things, we say that they are the sprouts of communism, that is to say, they still need to be continuously consolidated, promoted and improved in development. But "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and our task is to care for and support these sprouts with communist enthusiasm, so that they can continue to develop in the struggle against all old things and old ideas. What is a sprout today will inevitably become something large, universal and dominating everything in the future.
    The great significance of the people's commune movement lies in the fact that it has found a concrete way to gradually transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from the primary stage of communism to the advanced stage. This is the result of the creative application of Marxist scientific principles by the people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

    从人民公社看共产主义
    吴传启
    轰轰烈烈的人民公社化运动，正在全国范围内猛烈发展，而且已经快要完成了。人民公社的飞速发展，是我国当前飞速发展着的生产力迫切地要求相适应的生产关系的结果。从农业合作社到人民公社的发展，是我国社会“不断革命”的过程中，生产关系的又一次具有伟大历史意义的改变。所以人们把它叫作“更上一层楼”。
    自从全民大跃进以来，工农业生产的各个战线上，生产成倍、几倍、几十倍地跃进，劳动生产率成倍、几倍、几十、几百、几千倍地跃进。这种猛烈发展着的生产力，是人们思想解放的结果；同时又是促进新关系的产生和生长的动力。对于我国社会主义建设的进程来说，一方面，它标志着我国社会主义建设事业进入了一个新的加速发展的阶段，预示着我国工农业生产将得到更加猛烈的发展；另一方面，它使我国的六亿人民，明确了进一步发展的方向，找到了走向光芒万丈的共产主义社会的具体道路。
    同农业合作社比较，人民公社的优越性和它最本质的特点，就是“一曰大，二曰公”。所以它能满足当前进一步发展的生产力的客观要求。所谓“大”，就是人多，地广，力量大，全面经营事业多，这可以说是量的变化。所谓“公”，就是更加集体化和更加社会主义化，这也可以说是质的变化。人民公社既是加速建成社会主义的最好的组织形式，又是走向完全“无私”的共产主义社会的最好的过渡形式。人民公社所包含的共产主义的萌芽，就寓于这种日益向“大公无私”发展的总趋势之中。
    社会主义和共产主义是同一个类型的社会，是一个由初级向高级发展的过程。共产主义社会的到来，是社会主义建设的必然趋势。社会主义建设，是走向共产主义的必要准备。但二者又有其显明的区别。马克思把“各尽所能，按劳取酬”和“各尽所能，各取所需”这两个原则，作为区分两个阶段的科学的标志。人民公社的建立，当然还不是已经改变为全民所有制，更不是进入了“各取所需”的共产主义社会。它在性质上还是社会主义的。但它已在我们的实际生活中，随着工农业生产的大跃进，以萌芽的状态出现了。
    我们现实生活中出现的共产主义萌芽，可以从下列几方面进行一些初步探讨。
    第一、在社会主义制度下，还存在着两种社会主义所有制，即生产资料的集体所有制和全民所有制。社会主义的集体经济，是由个体经济转向全民经济的一个必经的阶段，它只是一种过渡的经济形式。因此它比原来的个体经济有无比的优越性。但是由于这些农业合作社一般规模小，经营范围窄，所以随着生产的飞跃发展，日益不能适应新的要求。在实行了并大社和转公社以后，就不仅克服了原来农业合作社的矛盾，而且使人民公社的集体经济同乡级县级的国有经济得到了密切的结合，开始冲破了两种社会主义所有制之间的界线。目前，除了一小部分人民公社开始实行了全民所有制外，绝大部分仍然是集体所有制。但它已经向全民所有制跨进了一大步，它本身就已经包含了若干全民所有制的成分。发展的趋向表明，大约三、四年或者五、六年，大体上都可以过渡到全民所有制。从集体经济向全民经济的过渡，也就是进一步向“大公”发展，是由共产主义的初级阶段向高级阶段过渡的基本任务之一，这种新的经济形式，意味着开始导向阶级差别的彻底消灭。
    但是如果仅仅实现了这个条件，还不是进入了共产主义社会。“过渡到了全民所有制，如国营工业那样，它的性质还是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳取酬。”（“中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”）因此还要看其他一些条件。
    第二、要实现向共产主义的过渡，就需要进一步消灭几千年来旧社会遗留下来的“旧式分工”。对于实现共产主义社会来说，恩格斯说过：“旧的生产方式，应该彻底地被改变，特别是旧的分工应该消灭。”（反杜林论）消灭旧的生产方式，是社会主义革命的任务。至于“旧式分工”，这就是以工农之间、城乡之间和脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的分离为特征的那种旧的社会分工，社会主义革命的胜利，消灭了它们之间的对抗，却不得不保留它们之间的重大差别。这种差别的存在，是人类的“不平等”得以在社会主义社会残留的根源。因此进一步消除以这种差别为特征的“旧式分工”，完全消灭这种差别，是向共产主义过渡的最根本的任务之一。
    在我国，从缩小工农之间和城乡之间的差别方面来说，自从党的社会主义建设总路线和“三并举”方针贯彻以后，就开始加速了这种发展的进程。如河南鲁山县从今年3月开始大办工业，实行农业同工业结合以来，到今年底工业产值就可以大大超过农业产值。五亿农民大办工业的创举，迅速改变着农村的落后面貌，也将迅速改变原来工业的城市和农业的乡村，先进的城市和落后的乡村之间的差别。从缩小脑力劳动同体力劳动之间的差别来说，自从党提出了全民办教育的方针，贯彻教育同劳动生产相结合，干部参加劳动等等以来，在这方面就已经出现了一片可喜的共产主义新气象。现在，广大农村里普遍发展了中学教育，普遍举办了技术教育和科学研究同工农业生产完全融合为一体的红专大学；与此同时，又掀起了人人搞发明、个个创奇迹、手艺人著书立说、庄稼汉提笔务虚，工农学哲学，居民学哲学的运动。还有学校办工厂，工厂办学校，以及在工厂中实行“两参一改”等，这就使工人、知识分子、干部的界限逐步趋向泯灭。这些都是向共产主义发展的新趋向，都是共产主义的萌芽。所有这些发展形式，随着人民公社的建立，都从组织形式上巩固和确立下来了。人民公社实行“工农商学兵”结合，“下田是农民，进厂是工人”，“工农群众知识化，知识分子劳动化”，培养既是劳动者又是知识分子的新人；以及随着乡村工业化的实现，逐渐打破城乡界限，这就是消灭“旧式分工”的具体途径。消灭“旧式分工”，是最深刻的革命，是对于人类的最后解放，同时也是对于造成人类“不平等”的最后根源的消除。因此“工农商学兵”的结合，不仅加快了当前的社会主义建设，而且也是伟大的共产主义的萌芽。
    第三，反映上述差别的“不平等”的资产阶级法权的残余，是社会主义制度下还不得不保留的旧社会“痕迹”之一。列宁曾经说过，在共产主义的第一阶段，“资产阶级式的法权”还没有完全取消，而只是局部取消，只有在已经达到的经济改革范围内，即只是对于生产资料的关系上取消。”（国家与革命）因此在另一些方面，它仍然是社会各成员间分配产品和分配劳动的调节者。“按劳取酬”，是同资产阶级的“不劳而获”对立而来的，是社会主义的原则，但它仍然是“资产阶级式的法权”。因为，按等量劳动取得等量报酬来说，这是平等的；但是，不相等的人们领得相等的报酬，这就意味着享受上的不平等。这种情形，是同生产发展的一定水平、工农差别、脑力劳动与体力劳动差别的存在、人们思想觉悟的状况等等相适应的。所以随着生产的高速度发展，逐步取消资产阶级法权的残余，逐步用共产主义原则来代替，一直到实行“各取所需”，是走向共产主义的根本任务。
    随着人民公社的建立，首先，有许多条件具备的公社已经实行粮食供给制，或者是伙食供给制，或者是生活基本需要供给制。有的实行“七包”或者“十包”：即包吃、穿、住、教、治病、死葬、理发、看戏、烤火费和结婚费等等。这种供给制当然还没有达到共产主义的“各取所需”，但它完全冲破了“按劳取酬”的法权界限，适合于进一步发展的要求，在“公”的方面向前发展了，因此它应该属于共产主义的范围，是共产主义的萌芽。
    更重要的，是在我们的现实生活中，无论城市和乡村，不分县、乡、社和山区、平原的界限，日益发展着共产主义的大协作和大规模的义务劳动，并且在这个基础上不断地创造着生产和建设的伟大奇迹。也就是说，在广大劳动人民中间，那种不计“劳”与“酬”之间的关系的义务劳动，那种无私的忘我劳动，正在广大城乡普遍发展。生活本身正在不断破坏着旧的法权残余。这种发展，表现了伟大的共产主义的光辉，这种光辉应该使它不断发扬光大。
    作为社会主义制度中保留的资产阶级法权的残余，是同资产阶级的“不劳而获”相对立的，但它同时又是与一定的生产水平和社会条件相适应的。因此“按劳取酬”只能是一种过渡的分配原则，应该把它作为新社会的一种“缺点”，又是一种不可避免的过程来理解。不是要一直去加强它，而是要逐步削弱它的作用。实际上，随着社会主义建设的每一步进展，也必然地将由共产主义的原则来代替它。
    第四、人民公社建立后，由于进一步解放生产力和发展生产力的要求，普遍实行了“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”。这就意味着劳动生产率的提高，更迅速地创造共产主义的生活条件。同时也标志着人与人之间的共产主义的完全平等的相互关系。同时也就使人民公社不仅成为生产的组织者，而且又是生活的组织者。
    生活集体化，是农民生活的大革命。许多地方实行了吃饭食堂化，老人幸福化，儿童养育托儿化，家务劳动社会化，青年教育社会化等等，都是创造共产主义生活条件的基本措施。列宁曾经把“公共食堂”、“托儿所”、“幼儿园”和青年教育社会化等等，作为共产主义萌芽的标本。因为这种新的发展，首先是彻底解放了妇女，最后把妇女从琐碎的家务劳动中解放出来，真正实现了男女平等，这是真正的共产主义。其次，它必然把作为社会经济单位的家庭最后冲破，使人们从狭隘的小家庭生活中解放出来。在这个发展的基础上，必然培植着“人人为我，我为人人”，以及“不独亲其亲，不独子其子”的新的共产主义的风格。
    最后，人民公社实行乡社合一，成为政治、经济、军事和文化教育的统一体，这意味着社会主义的上层建筑在基层政权方面的重大改变。显然，它更加符合于巩固和发展社会主义经济基础的要求。但是作为向共产主义过渡来说，恩格斯曾经说过：“对人的管理将被对物的管理和对生产过程的指导所代替。”（反杜林论）因此对于未来社会的基层组织单位来说，人民公社是实现这样一种过渡的过渡形式。因此，它也就包含了共产主义的萌芽。
    上述种种以及其它等等，我们说它是共产主义的萌芽，也就是说它还需要在发展中不断地巩固推广和完善。但“星星之火，可以燎原”，我们的任务，就是要以共产主义的热情来关心和扶持这些萌芽，使它们在同一切旧事物、旧思想的斗争中不断地得到发展。在今天是萌芽的东西，在将来必然成为大量普遍和统治一切的东西。
    人民公社化运动的伟大意义在于，它为逐步地从集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，以及从共产主义的初级阶段过渡到高级阶段，找到了具体的途径。这是我国人民在中国共产党的领导下创造性地运用马克思主义科学原理的结果。
