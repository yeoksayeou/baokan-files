    Viewing Communism from the People's Commune
    Wu Chuanqi
    The surging people's commune movement is developing vigorously throughout the country, and is about to be completed. The rapid development of the people's communes is the result of the current rapid development of productive forces in our country urgently requiring corresponding relations of production. The development from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes is another change of production relations with great historical significance in the process of China's "continuous revolution." Therefore, people call it "taking it to the next level."
    Since the great leap forward by the whole people, production on all fronts of industry and agriculture has leaped forward by multiples, several times, dozens of times, and labor productivity has leaped forward by multiples, several times, dozens, hundreds, and thousands of times. This vigorously developing productive force is the result of the liberation of people's minds; at the same time, it is also a driving force for the emergence and growth of new relationships. For the progress of socialist construction in our country, on the one hand, it marks that our socialist construction has entered a new stage of accelerated development, predicting that industrial and agricultural production in our country will achieve more vigorous development; on the other hand, it makes the six hundred million people in our country clear about the direction of further development and find a concrete path to the radiant communist society.
    Compared with agricultural cooperatives, the superiority and most essential characteristics of the people's communes are "first, large, and second, public." Therefore, it can meet the objective requirements of the current further development of productive forces. The so-called "large" means more people, more land, greater strength, and more comprehensive business operations, which can be said to be a change in quantity. The so-called "public" means more collectivized and more socialistic, which can also be said to be a change in quality. The people's commune is not only the best organizational form for accelerating the building of socialism, but also the best transitional form for moving towards a completely "selfless" communist society. The communist sprouts contained in the people's commune are inherent in this general trend of increasingly developing towards "great public-spiritedness and selflessness."
    Socialism and communism are the same type of society, a process of development from a primary to an advanced stage. The arrival of communist society is the inevitable trend of socialist construction. Socialist construction is the necessary preparation for moving towards communism. But the two also have clear differences. Marx took the principles of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" and "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" as scientific markers to distinguish between the two stages. The establishment of the people's commune, of course, does not mean that it has already been changed to ownership by the whole people, let alone entered the communist society of "to each according to his needs." In nature, it is still socialist. However, it has already appeared in our actual life in a budding state, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.
    The communist sprouts that appear in our real life can be initially explored from the following aspects.
    First, under the socialist system, there are still two types of socialist ownership, namely, collective ownership of the means of production and ownership by the whole people. Socialist collective economy is a necessary stage for the transition from individual economy to the economy of the whole people, and it is only a transitional economic form. Therefore, it has incomparable advantages over the original individual economy. However, since these agricultural cooperatives are generally small in scale and have a narrow scope of operation, they are increasingly unable to meet new requirements with the rapid development of production. After the implementation of merging large cooperatives and transforming them into communes, not only the contradictions of the original agricultural cooperatives were overcome, but also the collective economy of the people's communes was closely combined with the state-owned economy at the township and county levels, and began to break through the boundaries between the two socialist ownerships. At present, except for a small number of people's communes that have begun to implement ownership by the whole people, the vast majority are still under collective ownership. But it has already taken a big step towards ownership by the whole people, and it already contains several components of ownership by the whole people. The trend of development shows that it can generally transition to ownership by the whole people in about three or four years, or five or six years. The transition from collective economy to the economy of the whole people is also one of the basic tasks of transitioning from the primary stage of communism to the advanced stage, and this new economic form means that it begins to lead to the complete elimination of class differences.
    However, merely realizing this condition does not mean entering communist society. "Transitioning to ownership by the whole people, like state-owned industry, is still socialist in nature, from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." ("Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas") Therefore, we must also look at some other conditions.
    Second, to realize the transition to communism, it is necessary to further eliminate the "old-style division of labor" left over from the old society for thousands of years. For the realization of communist society, Engels said: "The old mode of production should be completely changed, especially the old division of labor should be eliminated." (Anti-DÃ¼hring) Eliminating the old mode of production is the task of the socialist revolution. As for the "old-style division of labor," this is the old social division of labor characterized by the separation between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. The victory of the socialist revolution eliminated the antagonism between them, but had to retain the significant differences between them. The existence of this difference is the root cause of the "inequality" that can remain in socialist society. Therefore, further eliminating the "old-style division of labor" characterized by this difference, and completely eliminating this difference, is one of the most fundamental tasks for transitioning to communism.
    In our country, in terms of narrowing the differences between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, the process of this development has been accelerated since the implementation of the Party's general line for socialist construction and the "three simultaneous development" policy. For example, since Lushan County in Henan Province started to run industries on a large scale in March this year and implemented the integration of agriculture and industry, the industrial output value may greatly exceed the agricultural output value by the end of this year. The initiative of 500 million peasants running industries on a large scale is rapidly changing the backwardness of rural areas, and will also rapidly change the differences between the original industrial cities and agricultural villages, and between advanced cities and backward villages. In terms of narrowing the differences between mental and physical labor, since the Party put forward the policy of the whole people running education, implemented the combination of education and labor production, cadres participating in labor, etc., a gratifying new communist atmosphere has already appeared in this regard. Now, secondary education has been universally developed in the vast rural areas, technical education and scientific research that are completely integrated with industrial and agricultural production have been universally carried out, and red and expert universities have been established; at the same time, a movement of everyone engaging in inventions, everyone creating miracles, artisans writing books, peasants writing theoretically, workers and peasants studying philosophy, and residents studying philosophy has been launched. There are also schools running factories, factories running schools, and the implementation of "two participations and one reform" in factories, which gradually eliminates the boundaries between workers, intellectuals, and cadres. All of these are new trends towards communism, and they are all sprouts of communism. All these forms of development have been consolidated and established organizationally with the establishment of the people's communes. The people's commune implements the combination of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers," "going to the fields as peasants, entering the factories as workers," "intellectualizing workers and peasants, and laborizing intellectuals," cultivating new people who are both laborers and intellectuals; and with the realization of rural industrialization, gradually breaking down the boundaries between urban and rural areas, this is the specific way to eliminate the "old-style division of labor." Eliminating the "old-style division of labor" is the most profound revolution, the final liberation of mankind, and at the same time, the elimination of the final source of human "inequality." Therefore, the combination of "workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers" not only accelerates the current socialist construction, but is also a great sprout of communism.
    Third, the remnants of bourgeois rights of "inequality" that reflect the above differences are one of the "traces" of the old society that still have to be retained under the socialist system. Lenin once said that in the first stage of communism, "bourgeois rights" have not been completely abolished, but only partially abolished, only within the scope of the economic reform that has been achieved, that is, only with respect to the relations of the means of production. (State and Revolution) Therefore, in some other aspects, it is still the regulator of the distribution of products and the distribution of labor among the members of society. "To each according to his work" is opposed to the bourgeois "no work, no gain," and is a socialist principle, but it is still a "bourgeois right." Because, it is equal in terms of obtaining equal remuneration for equal amounts of labor; however, unequal people receive equal remuneration, which means inequality in enjoyment. This situation is compatible with a certain level of production development, the existence of differences between workers and peasants, the existence of differences between mental and physical labor, the state of people's ideological awareness, and so on. Therefore, with the high-speed development of production, gradually abolishing the remnants of bourgeois rights, gradually replacing them with communist principles, and until the implementation of "to each according to his needs," is the fundamental task of moving towards communism.
    With the establishment of the people's communes, first of all, many communes with qualified conditions have implemented the grain supply system, or the food supply system, or the basic needs of life supply system. Some implement "seven guarantees" or "ten guarantees": that is, guarantees for food, clothing, housing, education, medical treatment, funerals, haircuts, watching operas, heating fees, and marriage expenses, etc. This supply system, of course, has not reached the communist "to each according to his needs," but it completely breaks through the legal boundaries of "to each according to his work," is suitable for the requirements of further development, and has developed forward in terms of "public," so it should belong to the scope of communism and is a sprout of communism.
    More importantly, in our real life, both in cities and villages, regardless of the boundaries of counties, townships, communes, and mountainous areas and plains, communist large-scale cooperation and large-scale voluntary labor are developing day by day, and on this basis, great miracles of production and construction are constantly being created. That is to say, among the broad masses of working people, the voluntary labor that does not count the relationship between "labor" and "remuneration," the selfless and selfless labor, is developing universally in urban and rural areas. Life itself is constantly destroying the remnants of the old laws. This development demonstrates the great communist brilliance, which should be continuously promoted and carried forward.
    As a remnant of bourgeois rights retained in the socialist system, it is opposed to the bourgeois "no work, no gain," but at the same time, it is also adapted to a certain level of production and social conditions. Therefore, "to each according to his work" can only be a transitional principle of distribution, and should be understood as a "shortcoming" of the new society, but also an unavoidable process. It is not to be continuously strengthened, but to gradually weaken its role. In fact, with each step forward in socialist construction, it will inevitably be replaced by communist principles.
    Fourth, after the establishment of the people's communes, in order to further liberate productive forces and develop productive forces, the policy of "organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization" has been universally implemented. This means an increase in labor productivity and the more rapid creation of communist living conditions. It also marks the completely equal communist relationship between people. At the same time, it makes the people's commune not only the organizer of production, but also the organizer of life.
    The collectivization of life is a great revolution in the lives of peasants. Many places have implemented dining in canteens, happiness for the elderly, nursery care for children, socialization of housework, and socialization of youth education, all of which are basic measures to create communist living conditions. Lenin once regarded "public canteens," "nurseries," "kindergartens," and the socialization of youth education as specimens of communist sprouts. Because this new development first completely liberates women, and finally liberates women from trivial housework, truly realizing equality between men and women, which is true communism. Secondly, it will inevitably break through the family as a socio-economic unit and liberate people from the narrow life of small families. On this basis of development, the new communist style of "everyone for me, I for everyone," and "not only loving one's own parents, not only loving one's own children" will inevitably be cultivated.
    Finally, the people's commune implements the integration of townships and communes, becoming a unified entity of politics, economy, military affairs, and culture and education, which means a major change in the superstructure of socialism in terms of grassroots political power. Obviously, it is more in line with the requirements of consolidating and developing the socialist economic base. But as for the transition to communism, Engels once said: "The administration of people will be replaced by the administration of things and the guidance of the production process." (Anti-DÃ¼hring) Therefore, for the grassroots organizational units of the future society, the people's commune is a transitional form to realize such a transition. Therefore, it also contains the sprouts of communism.
    The above and other things, we say that they are the sprouts of communism, that is to say, they still need to be continuously consolidated, promoted and improved in development. But "a single spark can start a prairie fire," and our task is to care for and support these sprouts with communist enthusiasm, so that they can continue to develop in the struggle against all old things and old ideas. What is a sprout today will inevitably become something large, universal and dominating everything in the future.
    The great significance of the people's commune movement lies in the fact that it has found a concrete way to gradually transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from the primary stage of communism to the advanced stage. This is the result of the creative application of Marxist scientific principles by the people of our country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.
