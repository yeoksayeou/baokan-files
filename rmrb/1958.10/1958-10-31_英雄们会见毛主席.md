Spring thunder-like applause echoed on the lawn of the Huairen Hall's back garden, and happiness shone on the faces of every member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation and the Volunteer Army Art Troupe. Facing this thunderous applause and excited smiling faces, Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Zhu De, and other leaders of the Party Central Committee walked over. As Chairman Mao walked in front of the spirited and exceptionally joyful volunteer army heroes, a pleasant smile always floated on his kind face. Our great leader Chairman Mao applauded warmly with everyone for a long time, paying tribute to the victorious heroes and welcoming the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland back in triumph.

When Chairman Mao saw General Yang Yong, commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and General Wang Ping, political commissar, the first thing he asked with concern was, "Have you all returned?" General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping replied in unison: "Having bid farewell to the heroic Korean people, we have all returned to the embrace of the motherland!" At this time, Chairman Mao said again: "A warm welcome to you!"

Without the need for more words, from Chairman Mao's excited expression and hearty laughter, the heroes once again deeply felt the boundless care and love of our great motherland, the Party, and Chairman Mao for them.

After the applause subsided, Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee sat down and took photos with everyone. When Chairman Mao and others said goodbye to everyone, the heroes, facing the warm and bright sunshine and looking at Chairman Mao's tall figure, burst into even warmer applause. This applause expressed the heroes' love for the great leader. The heroes all regarded October 29th as the happiest day of their lives. They saw that Chairman Mao was so healthy, and they all believed that this was their happiness and the happiness of the people of the whole country.

Strength comes from the motherland, and victory and honor come from the people of the motherland, from the Party and Chairman Mao. It was the motherland, the Party, and Chairman Mao who gave them light and heat, and it was the motherland, the Party, and Chairman Mao who encouraged them to expose the American paper tiger on the Korean battlefield and establish immortal feats. During those arduous years of resisting American aggressors, thousands upon thousands of volunteer soldiers and officers had a common aspiration, which was: "See Chairman Mao in Beijing after victory!" Today, in the back garden of Huairen Hall, the heroes said excitedly: "Our wish has come true!"

Combat hero Wang Zhanshan's face flushed with excitement. It could be seen how excited and excited he was. He kept looking at his watch, waiting and waiting for that precious moment to arrive.

It was this young man who, in the final battle of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea—the Jincheng counterattack—when the battle was at its most critical juncture, burned everything he had on his body, preparing to shed the last drop of blood for the motherland. He only kept an oil-printed portrait of Chairman Mao taken from his notebook, looked at it again and again, and said over and over again: "Chairman Mao, I am your good soldier, as long as I am here, the position is here!" At that time, he was full of strength. Although he was wounded three times, he still endured the severe pain, rolled, crawled, and led the soldiers of the entire platoon to defeat more than thirty fierce attacks by the enemy, annihilating more than four hundred enemies.

Now, our beloved Chairman Mao has come to his side. Chairman Mao shook his hand and asked him very kindly what his name was. Wang Zhanshan had so many hidden words in his heart to pour out to the great leader! However, at this moment, he couldn't remember a word. He just said to Chairman Mao, "My name is Wang Zhanshan, my name is Wang Zhanshan." As he spoke, his eyes welled up!

After returning to his residence, the heart of this young hero could not be calmed at all. He picked up his pen and wrote an unforgettable page in his diary: "What a warm and happy moment this is! This honor is given to us by the Party and the motherland. In the future, I will maintain this honor and contribute all my strength to the great cause of building and defending the motherland. In the future, as long as I think of Chairman Mao, even if I encounter great difficulties, I will be able to overcome them!"

Who can imagine that on the Korean battlefield, three heroes once held a position of three hundred meters in diameter for several days and nights, repelling six fierce attacks by the American invading army and annihilating more than one hundred and ten enemies. Two of these three heroes have already sacrificed for the motherland on the position they held, leaving us forever with immortal feats, while Zhao Jihua—this "lone hero" who is infinitely loyal to the motherland—finally realized his wish of "returning to Beijing to see Chairman Mao after victory" today, carrying his own ambition and the entrustment of his two dead comrades.

What force encourages our heroes to become an eternally invincible force? The happy meeting made Zhao Jihua recall the scene when they held the position. It was during the summer counterattack in 1953 when Zhao Jihua and his two comrades were holding the 42nd position on Ma Liangshan. The enemy attacked their position with fierce artillery fire and absolute superiority in strength. The three heroes solemnly swore an oath on the position and launched a competition to render meritorious service, "See who does more for the motherland, and see who adds more glory to Chairman Mao." They annihilated more than fifty invading enemies in one fell swoop and repelled the first attack, but Zhao Jihua's two comrades also shed their last drop of blood in the first counterattack. At this time, Zhao Jihua, who was guarding the position alone, launched a fierce ideological struggle: Should he retreat, or should he fight? He thought of the entrustment of the people of the motherland when he went abroad, and he thought of the honor of being a soldier of Chairman Mao. He suddenly stood up from the position, threw out a batch of grenades, and a pile of invaders' corpses lay horizontally in front of the heroic position again. "As long as someone is here, the position is here. Holding on for one minute is one minute of victory, and killing one enemy is one more earned." For the glory of the motherland and Chairman Mao, Zhao Jihua had put life and death aside. While holding the position, he left the last grenade for himself, preparing to perish with the position and the invading enemy at any time. In this way, Zhao Jihua alone repelled five more attacks by the enemy, annihilating more than sixty enemies. In front of the volunteer soldiers, who represent the spirit of high revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people, the ferocious enemy was finally repelled, and the heroic position was preserved.

Since stepping on the soil of the motherland in Andong, this young hero had been looking forward to this day—meeting our great leader for the first time. For several days, he went everywhere to find old comrades who had seen Chairman Mao, carefully inquiring about Chairman Mao's clothes and demeanor when he received them in the past, so that he could compare them with his impressions after seeing Chairman Mao. After the news that Chairman Mao was going to meet them came, Zhao Jihua became even more restless, opening the door and going out to inquire about the time and place of the meeting, and then returning to the room to tidy up his clothes. He wanted to sit down and read the newspaper to calm his excited mood, but when he picked up the newspaper, he couldn't read a word. After the happy meeting, this poor child, who had been sold to a landlord's house when he was eight years old, immediately wrote down the moment when Chairman Mao received him in his diary, and wrote the words "I will never forget this day in my life."

"Seeing the dear Chairman Mao and shaking hands, it's really a joy and excitement. I will never forget this thing in my life." After Chairman Mao received the volunteer army delegation, the heart of Lu Changrong, a Communist Party member and a second-class combat hero, could not be calmed down, and finally, he opened the diary he brought back from North Korea and wrote the above words as a permanent memorial.

How much passion and happiness does these short words contain! On the Korean battlefield, it was Chairman Mao who encouraged every soldier of the Volunteer Army, increasing their confidence, strength, and courage in the battle to strike the American aggressors, making them fearless heroes who established immortal feats.

Five years ago, during the planning of the famous Shixian Cave North Mountain counterattack, the soldiers of the company commanded by Lu Changrong solemnly swore an oath to the Party and Chairman Mao, and everyone wrote their names on a red flag, determined to plant this red flag on the Shixian Cave North Mountain position. The soldiers said: "Chairman Mao is watching us, we must plant the red flag on Shixian Cave North Mountain and strive to see Chairman Mao in Beijing." The battle started, and the soldiers of the entire company commanded by Lu Changrong, under the cover of strong artillery fire, captured the position fortified by an American reinforced company in just over ten minutes, and held the position for a day and two nights, repelling eleven crazy counterattacks by the enemy. Although Lu Changrong was injured, he stubbornly persisted in the battle. Under his call of "Add glory to the motherland and add glory to Chairman Mao," even the seriously wounded lay in the concealed bunkers, wiping weapons for their comrades on the front lines. The soldiers on the front lines ran out of bullets, so they took the bullets from the enemy's corpses and returned to the enemy fiercely. They finally killed and wounded more than 400 enemies, completed the task assigned by the superiors, and let the red flag signed with the names of all the soldiers of the company fly over the sky above Shixian Cave North Mountain as steadily as Mount Tai.

Five years later, Lu Changrong returned to the motherland with the achievements of all the soldiers of the company, and returned to Chairman Mao's side. Realizing his long-cherished wish, how could Lu Changrong not feel that this was the greatest happiness of the volunteer soldiers!

Chairman Mao shook the hand of a young volunteer soldier with his warm hand. Chairman Mao asked him what his name was. The young soldier's face flushed with excitement, and he said, "My name is Huang Zhifu." At this time, Commander Yang Yong introduced to the Chairman that he was the one who was called "living Luo Shengjiao" by the Korean people. Chairman Mao nodded with a smile and looked at the young soldier for a long time.

Chairman Mao's teaching of loving Korea's "every mountain, every river, every grass, and every tree" was deeply imprinted on the hearts of all volunteer soldiers and officers. The young soldier Huang Zhifu once risked his own life to rescue a Korean child. One day in November 1956, Li Qinghuan, a teenager, accidentally fell into the ice cave of the Linjin River. Huang Zhifu, who was on the playground by the river, jumped into the ice cave to rescue the child. The biting river water in the cold winter had made Huang Zhifu's hands and feet numb, and several places on his body were cut by ice and bled, and the river water submerged the top of his head several times. However, at this dangerous moment, Huang Zhifu thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and the fraternal friendship of the Korean people. He was determined that even if he sacrificed himself, he could not let the Korean children drown. He tried his best to fight the ice and finally rescued Li Qinghuan. Afterwards, the local people in Korea called Huang Zhifu "Living Luo Shengjiao" and gave him high honor, but the twenty-two-year-old Huang Zhifu said to everyone that his honor should be attributed to the Party and to Chairman Mao. He thanked the Party and Chairman Mao for teaching him to become a glorious internationalist soldier.

After Huang Zhifu met Chairman Mao, happiness has been stirring in his heart. Huang Zhifu was so excited that he couldn't fall asleep all night. He thought for a long time: I have made too few contributions to the motherland in the past, how can I live up to the care given to me by the Party and Chairman Mao? So he picked up his pen and wrote another guarantee to the Party and Chairman Mao: "Defend the motherland with the courage of Comrade Huang Jiguang, and build the motherland with the perseverance of Comrade Wu Yunduo."

Huang Zhifu's words expressed the common aspiration of the volunteer army heroes. On the night after the happy meeting, the heroes all made new oaths to the motherland and Chairman Mao: "Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go, contribute all our strength to the construction front, and make new contributions in the struggle against American imperialist aggression!"

    英雄们会见毛主席
    新华社记者　于民生、袁木、汪波清
    怀仁堂后花园的草坪上响起了春雷般的掌声，幸福的光芒闪耀在中国人民志愿军代表团和志愿军文工团每一个人的脸上。迎着这春雷般的掌声和一个个激动的笑脸，毛泽东主席、周恩来同志、朱德同志和党中央的其他领导人走过来了。毛主席走过精神焕发、欢乐非凡的志愿军英雄们面前时，他那慈祥的脸上一直浮现着愉快的笑容。我们伟大的领袖毛主席长时间地同大家一起热烈鼓掌，向胜利的英雄们致意，欢迎祖国的优秀儿女凯旋归来。
    毛主席在看到中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将和政治委员王平上将的时候，第一句话就关怀地问：“都回来了吗？”杨勇上将和王平上将齐声回答：“告别了英雄的朝鲜人民，我们全部回到祖国的怀抱了！”这时，毛主席又说：“热烈欢迎你们！”
    用不着更多的话语，从毛主席那兴奋的神态上和那朗朗的笑声中，英雄们再一次深深地体会到，我们伟大的祖国、党和毛主席对他们的无比关怀和热爱。
    在掌声平息以后，毛主席和党中央的领导同志坐下来，同大家一起照了相。当毛主席等和大家告别的时候，英雄们迎着温暖、灿烂的阳光，望着毛主席魁梧的身影，响起了更加热烈的掌声。这掌声表达了英雄们对伟大领袖的热爱。英雄们都把10月29日这一天看做一生中最幸福的一天，他们看到毛主席的身体是那样的健康，他们都认为这是自己的幸福，也是全国人民的幸福。
    力量来自祖国，胜利和荣誉来自祖国人民，来自党和毛主席。是祖国、党和毛主席给了他们光和热，是祖国、党和毛主席鼓舞他们在朝鲜战场上戳穿了美国纸老虎，建立了不朽的功勋。在那些抗击美国侵略者的艰苦岁月里，千千万万志愿军指战员，有着一个共同的美好心愿，这就是：“胜利后到北京见毛主席！”今天，在怀仁堂的后花园里，英雄们激动地说：“我们的心愿实现了！”
    战斗英雄王占山的脸上泛起了阵阵的红润，可以看出他是多么的兴奋和激动。他不时地看着表，盼望着，盼望着那珍贵时刻的到来。
    就是这位年青的人，在抗美援朝的最后一战——金城反击战争中，当战斗处在最危急的关头时，他把自己身上带的一切东西都烧毁了，准备为祖国流尽最后一滴血。只留下从笔记本上取下的一幅油印的毛主席像，放在手里看了又看，一遍又一遍地说着：“毛主席，我是你的好战士，有我就有阵地！”那时，他浑身都充满了力量，虽然他三次负伤，但他仍忍着剧痛，滚着，爬着，带领全排战士打垮了敌人三十多次凶猛进攻，消灭了敌人四百多名。
    现在我们敬爱的毛主席来到了他的身边。毛主席握着他的手极为亲切地问他叫什么名字。王占山有多少隐藏在内心的话语要向伟大的领袖倾述啊！可是，这一刻他一句话也想不起来了，他只是对毛主席说：“我叫王占山，我叫王占山。”说着，说着，他的两眼润湿了！
    在回到住所以后，这位年青的英雄的心一点也不能平静，他提起笔来写下了一生难忘的一页日记：“这是多么温暖幸福的时刻呀！这个荣誉是党和祖国给我们的，今后我要保持这个荣誉，在建设祖国和保卫祖国的伟大事业中贡献出全部力量。今后，只要我一想起毛主席，就是遇到了天大的困难，我也能克服！”
    有谁能够想像，在朝鲜战场上有三位英雄曾经几个昼夜坚守住一个方圆三百公尺的阵地，打退了美国侵略军的六次猛烈攻击，消灭了敌人一百一十多人。这三位英雄中已经有两位在坚守住的阵地上为祖国而牺牲，带着不朽的功勋永远地离开了我们，而赵积华——这位对祖国无限忠诚的“孤胆英雄”，今天终于带着他自己的雄心壮志和两位死去的战友的嘱托，实现了“胜利后回北京见毛主席”的愿望。
    是什么力量鼓舞着我们的英雄成为永远不可战胜的力量？幸福的会见让赵积华回想起了他们当年坚守阵地的情景。那是在1953年的夏季反击战中，赵积华同他的两位战友坚守在马良山的四十二号阵地上，敌人以猛烈的炮火和绝对优势的兵力向他们的阵地攻击。三位英雄在阵地上庄严地宣誓，展开了立功竞赛，“看谁多为祖国效劳，看谁多为毛主席增光”。他们一举消灭了来犯的敌人五十多人，打退了第一次攻击，但是赵积华的两位战友也在第一个反击中流尽了最后一滴血。这时，孤守阵地的赵积华思想上展开了激烈的斗争：是撤，还是打？他想到了出国时祖国人民的嘱托，想到了作为毛主席的战士的荣誉，他猛地从阵地上站立起来，扔出了一批手雷，一堆侵略者的尸体又横躺在英雄阵地的面前。“有人就有阵地在，坚守一分钟就是一分钟的胜利，打死一个敌人就多赚一个”，为了祖国和毛主席的光荣，赵积华已把生死置之度外，他一面坚守阵地，一面为自己留下最后一个手榴弹，准备随时同阵地和来犯的敌人同归于尽。就这样，赵积华一个人又打退敌人的五次攻击，消灭敌人六十多人。在代表着中国人民高度革命英雄主义精神的志愿军战士面前，凶恶的敌人终于被打退了，英雄的阵地保住了。
    这位年青的英雄自从在安东踏上祖国的土地以后，就日夜盼望着这一天——第一次同我们伟大的领袖会见。他几天来到处去找那些见到过毛主席的老战友，仔细盘问毛主席过去接见他们的时候的衣着、神态，以便同他见到毛主席以后的印象作比较。毛主席要接见他们的消息传来以后，赵积华更是坐立不安，一会儿推门出去打听接见的时间和地点，一会儿又回到房间整理自己的服装。他想坐下来看看报纸，安定一下自己激动的心情，但他拿起报纸来一个字也看不下去。在幸福的会见之后，这位从八岁就被卖给了地主家里的穷孩子，立刻在自己的日记本上工整地写下了主席接见他的时刻，写下了“一生中也忘不了这一天”的字句。
      “见到了亲爱的毛主席，还握了手，真叫人高兴加高兴，兴奋加兴奋。这件事情一生我也不会忘记。”毛主席接见了志愿军代表团以后，共产党员、二级战斗英雄陆昌荣的心怎么也不能平静下来，最后他终于翻开了那个从朝鲜带回的日记本，写下上面的话，做为永远的纪念。
    这短短的几句话是包含着多少的激情和幸福的心意啊！在朝鲜战场上，正是毛主席鼓舞着志愿军的每一个战士，使他们在打击美国侵略军的战斗里增加了必胜的信心、力量和勇气，使他们成了立下不朽功勋的无畏英雄。
    五年前，在酝酿著名的石岘洞北山反击战中，陆昌荣所指挥的连队的战士们，每一个人都庄严地向党和毛主席宣誓，并且每个人都在一面红旗上写下自己的名字，决心要把这面红旗插上石岘洞北山阵地。战士们说：“毛主席看着我们，我们一定要把红旗插上石岘洞北山，争取到北京见毛主席。”战斗打响了，陆昌荣指挥的全连战士，在强大炮火掩护下，仅仅十多分钟，就夺得美军一个加强连固守的阵地，并且坚守阵地一昼两夜，打退敌人的十一次疯狂反扑。陆昌荣虽然负了伤，但是他还顽强地坚持战斗，战士们在他发出的“为祖国增光，为毛主席增光”的号召下，就连重伤员也躺在掩蔽坑里，为前沿阵地上的战友们擦拭武器。前沿的战士们打光了子弹，就拿下敌人尸体上的子弹，狠狠回击敌人。他们终于杀伤敌人四百多名，完成了上级交付的任务，让签着全连战士名字的红旗，稳如泰山般地飘扬在石岘洞北山的上空。
    五年后的今天，陆昌荣带着全连战士的功绩回到祖国，回到了毛主席的身边。实现了日夜盼望的宿愿，这怎么能不使陆昌荣不感到这是志愿军战士的最大幸福呢！
    毛主席用他那温暖的手握住了一位年青志愿军战士的手，毛主席问他叫什么名字，年青战士满脸泛着激动的红光，他说：“我叫黄治富”。这时，杨勇司令员向主席介绍说，就是他被朝鲜人民称为“活的罗盛教”。毛主席含笑点头，久久地望着这个年青战士。
    毛主席的要热爱朝鲜的“一山、一水、一草、一木”的教导，无比深刻地印在了全体志愿军指战员的心上。年青战士黄治富曾经不顾自己的生命的危险，抢救了一位朝鲜儿童。那是在1956年11月的一天，十几岁的李清焕失脚掉进了临津江的冰窟中，正在江边操场上的黄治富，毅然地跳进冰窟抢救小孩。严冬里刺骨的江水使得黄治富已手脚麻木，身上有好几处被冰块割破流出鲜血，江水几次都淹没了他的头顶，但是，就在这危险的时刻，黄治富想起了毛主席的教导，想起了朝鲜人民亲如手足的情谊，他下定决心，即使牺牲自己，也不能让朝鲜儿童淹死。他用尽全力和冰块搏斗，终于把李清焕抢救了出来。事后，朝鲜当地人民都称黄治富是“活罗盛教”，给了他崇高的荣誉，但是二十二岁的黄治富却逢人便说，他的荣誉应该归功于党，归功于毛主席，他感谢党和毛主席把他教养成一个光荣的国际主义战士。
    黄治富会见了毛主席以后，幸福一直激荡着他的心窝。黄治富兴奋得一夜不能入睡，他久久地思念：我过去对祖国的贡献太少了，我怎样才能不辜负党和毛主席给我的关怀呢？于是他提起笔再次向党和毛主席写下保证：“以黄继光同志的勇敢精神保卫祖国，以吴运铎同志的毅力建设祖国。”
    黄治富的话，表达了志愿军英雄们的共同心意。在幸福的会见以后的那个夜晚，英雄们都向祖国和毛主席立下了新的誓言：“毛主席指向哪里，我们就走向哪里，在建设战线上贡献一切力量，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中再建奇勋！”（附图片）
