Since our Defense Minister Peng Dehuai issued the "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan," the vast number of military personnel and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu have expressed enthusiastic welcome, and fair-minded public opinion in various countries also believes that this is another major effort by the Chinese government to seek a peaceful resolution of China's internal war. As long as the United States abandons its interference in China's internal affairs, the Chinese people will solve their own problems.

However, the US authorities insist on meddling at this time, claiming that the temporary cessation of shelling by our army on the Fujian front is "in line with" the US's "ceasefire" demands. US Secretary of State Dulles stated on the 7th that "the cessation of shelling by China is what the United States has been striving to achieve." Spokesman White also said, "We hope the current ceasefire will continue." According to a report from the Associated Press in Washington, US government officials are "trying to extend this truce into a permanent ceasefire." From these reactions of the US government, it can be judged that the US is trying to pass off the sham for the genuine, attempting to make demands for China to "extend the cessation of shelling," and even "permanently cease shelling," in order to realize the US's "ceasefire" conspiracy. This conspiracy of the US has long gone bankrupt. China and the US have not opened fire on each other, and there is no fire to cease at all. In China, there is only the fire of internal war. The war is being fought by the Chinese, and whether to fight or stop is China's internal affair, which should be resolved by the Chinese themselves and has nothing to do with the US. The Americans have absolutely no right to interfere. And the gentlemen of the US State Department are not representatives entrusted by the Taiwan authorities, so what right do they have to talk about "ceasefire" with us? Even if the Taiwan authorities entrusted them, the Chinese people would never recognize it. No Chinese with national self-respect would ever want foreigners as representatives while they hide behind. China's civil war has been fought for thirty years, which is not a short time. It is the universal desire of the Chinese people to end this civil war as soon as possible. Minister Peng Dehuai has already suggested to the Taiwan authorities in his letter to compatriots in Taiwan to hold negotiations and implement a peaceful resolution. As soon as the Taiwan authorities have a corresponding response, peace talks can be held. The overall resolution of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu can all be negotiated, not just the cessation of shelling on Kinmen. This is an internal matter of the Chinese people, which is easy to discuss, and there is no need and absolutely no allowance for the US to interfere.

The reason why the gentlemen of the US State Department are so "enthusiastic" about China's affairs, to put it bluntly, is that all their talk about "maintaining a peace of glory and justice" is false, and at heart they want to expand their aggression against China. We have pointed out long ago that the US's so-called "ceasefire" is not only to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu, but also to obstruct the liberation of Kinmen and Matsu. In other words, it is not only to legitimize the US occupation of Taiwan, but also to expand the scope of aggression to Kinmen and Matsu, to realize its "two Chinas" conspiracy, and to prepare for a war against the Chinese mainland. This is intolerable, what is not tolerable? The gentlemen of the US State Department should calmly consider that your "ceasefire" proposals have been resolutely and decisively rejected by China since the Warsaw talks. Are you still dreaming now? We can tell you that the Chinese people want a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu issues. The method is for us to hold negotiations with the Taiwan authorities. Not only does the US have no right to interfere in the Kinmen and Matsu issues, but the US also has no right to interfere in the Taiwan and Penghu issues. The only thing that the Americans can do and must do is to withdraw all US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

The US State Department's announcement on the 8th that it is suspending escorting the Chiang army is certainly not a bad thing. Minister Peng Dehuai's announcement clearly stated that our army will suspend shelling Kinmen for a week, but on the condition that there are no US ships escorting. Some people in the US previously thought that it would be sufficient to stop the escort "quietly" without making a public announcement, supposedly to avoid giving the impression of "obeying Beijing." In fact, to save face, it would be fine to do it "quietly," and of course, it would be more honest to make a public announcement. However, it should be pointed out that the US State Department's statement that "the United States does not temporarily need to conduct escorts militarily" is completely wrong. US escorting itself is an interference in China's internal affairs. Under no circumstances does the US not need to escort, but rather has no right to escort at all. The US State Department's statement also said that "if the Chinese Communists resume attacks," then "US escort activities will immediately resume to the extent needed." This proves that the US still adheres to its aggressive policy of interfering in China's internal affairs.

Eight years ago, the US occupied China's territory of Taiwan, which is the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East. Recently, the US has deployed an unprecedentedly large military force to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, creating an extremely serious war crisis. Although the US is desperately trying to quibble, facts always speak louder than sophistry.

Until now, the US also admits that it is not at war with the People's Republic of China, admits that we have not attacked you, and admits that it wants to conduct peaceful negotiations with China to resolve international disputes between China and the US. So why has the US concentrated such a large naval and air force in the Taiwan Strait, and violated China's mainland airspace and territorial waters more than twenty times, supplying Chiang Kai-shek's army with "Sidewinder" missiles to attack our air force? What are all these actions if not military provocations?

Since occupying Taiwan, the US has publicly declared Taiwan as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" of the US, and now it has even deployed missile units. A full complement of personnel for a "Nike-Hercules" missile battalion arrived in Taiwan on the 8th. Its battalion commander, Greenberg, also stated that "we are prepared to stay here for a long time; this is not a temporary operation." "We hope to be ready for combat within a week to ten days." And in the months before that, the US "Matador" missile units had already installed launchers aimed at the mainland in Taiwan. Recently, the US is building the largest air force base in Gongguan, Taiwan, which is said to allow the US Strategic Air Command to strike targets in the heartland of China and the Soviet Union from a long distance. What are all these actions if not preparing for war?

The tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is precisely caused by a series of US aggressive activities hostile to the Chinese people. As our Foreign Ministry spokesman said, the best way to untie the knot is for the one who tied it to untie it. The key to easing the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait is for the United States to withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The Americans should go back to wherever they came from. The Chinese people have long told the Americans clearly: of the thirty-six stratagems, retreat is the best. It won't work for the US not to leave. It is in the US's interest to leave early, because then it can take the initiative; it is not in the US's interest to leave late, because then it will always be passive. If the US says that it has no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs, no intention of creating "two Chinas," and no intention of threatening China with war, then please show us your actions: your armed forces should completely stop the so-called escort, stop invading China's mainland airspace and territorial waters, stop conducting military provocations and war threats in the Taiwan Strait area, and the US negotiating ambassador, Beam, should honestly sit down and negotiate seriously. There are issues to be discussed between us and the Americans, and that is to discuss the specific methods for the US to withdraw all US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. As for what "ceasefire," "two Chinas," and so on, it is best to put them away as soon as possible.

Which way to go, the gentlemen in Washington should consider carefully. The noose is merciless. Persisting in staying will inevitably lead to a day of regret.

### 休谈“停火”走为上计

    休谈“停火”走为上计
    我国防部彭德怀部长发表“告台湾同胞书”以后，台澎金马广大军民同胞都表示热烈欢迎，各国的公正舆论也认为这是中国政府谋求和平解决中国内战问题的又一次重大的努力，只要美国放弃干涉中国内政，中国人自己是会解决自己的问题的。
    但是，美国当局偏要在这个时候来插一手，把福建前线我军的暂停炮击说成是“符合”美国“停火”要求的。美国国务卿杜勒斯7日声称，“中国停止炮轰，是美国一直竭力谋求的事情。”发言人怀特还说：“我们希望目前的停火继续下去。”据美联社华盛顿的消息报道：美国政府的官员，“正在设法使这种休战延长为永久的停火。”从美国官方的这些反应可以判明，美国是在打算鱼目混珠，妄想提出什么要求我国“延长停止炮击”，以至“永久停止炮击”，来实现美国的“停火”阴谋。美国的这个阴谋，早已破产了。中国同美国之间没有开火，根本无火可停。在中国只有内战之火，仗是中国人打的，是打是停，是中国的内政，应由中国人自己解决，全与美国无关，美国人绝对无权过问。而美国国务院的先生们不是台湾当局委托的代表，又有什么权利来同我国谈“停火”呢？即使台湾当局委托了他们，中国人民也决不承认。任何有民族自尊心的中国人绝不要外国人当代表，而自己躲在后边。中国的内战打了三十年，时间不算短。尽早结束这场内战是中国人的普遍愿望。彭德怀部长在告台湾同胞书中已经向台湾当局建议举行谈判，实行和平解决。一俟台湾当局有相应的反应，和谈就可举行。台澎金马的全面解决都可以谈判，岂止是停止对金门的炮击？这是中国人内部的事情，是好商量的，用不着也绝不容许美国人干预。
    美国国务院的先生们对中国的事情之所以如此“热心”，拆穿来说，所谓“维护光荣和正义的和平”全是假话，骨子里是要扩大对中国的侵略。我们早就指出过，美国的所谓“停火”，不仅是阻挠中国人民解放台澎，而且是阻挠解放金马，换句话说，就是不仅要使美国占领台湾合法化，而且要把侵略范围扩大到金马，实现它的“两个中国”的阴谋，并进而准备对中国大陆的战争。是可忍，孰不可忍？美国国务院的先生们应当冷静地想一想，你们的“停火”主张从华沙会谈以来，都被中国决然断然地拒绝了，你们现在还要做梦吗？可以告诉你们，中国人民要全面和平解决台澎金马问题，方法是我们同台湾当局举行谈判。不但金马问题美国无权过问，台澎问题美国也无权过问。美国人可以做而且必须做的唯一的一件事就是从台湾和台湾海峡撤走所有美国武装部队。
    美国国务院8日声明暂停给蒋军护航，这当然不是坏事。彭德怀部长的文告中明白宣布，我军在一周内暂停炮击金门，但以没有美舰护航为条件。美国方面原先有人认为“悄悄地”停止护航就行了，不必明令宣布，据说这就可以避免给人以“听命于北京”的印象。其实，为了顾全面子，“悄悄地”亦无不可，明令宣布当然也较为老实些。但是，应当指出，美国国务院说“美国在军事上暂时没有必要进行护航”，这种说法是完全错误的。美国护航本身就是干涉中国内政，不论在什么情况下，美国不是没有必要护航，而是根本无权护航。美国国务院的声明中还说到，“如果中国共产党恢复袭击”，那么“美国的护航活动将马上恢复到需要的程度”。这证明美国仍然坚持干涉中国内政的侵略政策。
    八年以前，美国侵占了我国的领土台湾，这是远东紧张局势的根源。最近期间，美国调来战后空前庞大的兵力，集中到台湾和台湾海峡地区，造成了极端严重的战争危机。美国虽则拼命狡辩，但是事实总是胜于诡辩的。
    直到现在，美国也承认同中华人民共和国并无战争，也承认我们并未打你们，也承认要同中国进行和平谈判来解决中美之间的国际争端，那么，为什么美国又在台湾海峡集中了这样庞大的海军和空军，并且侵犯我国大陆领空和领海二十多次，供给蒋介石军队以“响尾蛇”式导弹进攻我国空军呢？所有这一切，不是军事挑衅是什么？
    美国自从占领台湾以来，就公开宣布台湾是美国的“不沉的航空母舰”，现在更加调来了导弹部队。一个“奈克—赫尔克里斯”式导弹营的全部人马，已经在8日到达台湾。它的营长格林堡并且声称，“我们准备长期呆在这里，这不是一个暂时的行动”。“我们希望在一周到十天之内作好作战准备。”而在这之前几个月，美国的“斗牛士式”导弹部队已经在台湾安设好对准大陆的发射器。最近，美国又在台湾的公馆修建一个最大的空军基地，据说，美国的战略空军从这里可远距离袭击中国和苏联的腹心地区的目标。所有这一切，不是准备战争又是什么？
    台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，正是由于美国一系列的敌视中国人民的侵略活动所造成的。正如我外交部发言人所说的，解铃最好是系铃人。消除台湾海峡紧张局势的关键，是美国从台湾和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。美国人从哪里来，就该回到哪里去。中国人民早已明白地告诉过美国人：三十六计，走为上计。美国人不走是不行的。早走于美国有利，因为那就可以取得主动；迟走于美国不利，因为那就老是被动。如果美国说它无意干涉中国的内政，无意制造“两个中国”，又无意对中国进行战争威胁，那么，就请拿出你们的行动来：你们的武装力量就应该完全停止所谓护航，停止侵入中国的大陆的领空和领海，停止在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，美国的谈判大使比姆，就应该老老实实地坐下来认真谈判。我们同美国人之间是有问题可谈的，这就是商谈美国从台湾和台湾海峡撤走一切美国武装力量的具体办法。至于什么“停火”、“两个中国”等等，诸如此类，还是趁早收起为妙。
    何去何从，华盛顿的先生们好自为之。绞索是无情的，赖着不走，总有后悔之日。
