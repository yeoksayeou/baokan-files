    Thieving Brothers
    Poem by Tian Ma, Painting by Ying Tao
    News reports: Under the open connivance of a British warship command, a British fishing boat stole a Soviet flag to invade Icelandic territorial waters. With American diplomats committing theft before them, now British pirates compete with the “beauty” afterward, truly a double marvel! It's truly bizarre, happening in the Western world, stealing the Soviet flag to invade Icelandic territorial waters. Look at their smug satisfaction, thinking it's a brilliant plan, both to shift the blame and to steal wealth. Such despicable and sordid behavior, how can it see the light of day? Two crimes exposed at once, earning a notorious reputation. The insidious schemes are ineffective, the painted skin is completely peeled off, allied brothers compete in ugliness, all alike are robbers! (Image attached)

    盗兄盗弟
    天马诗  英韬画
    报载：英国渔船在英国军舰指挥部公开纵容之下，盗用苏联国旗侵犯冰岛领海。既有美国外交官作贼于前，今又有英国海盗比“美”于后，可称双绝！真是千奇百怪，出在西方世界，盗用苏联国旗，侵犯冰岛领海。看他洋洋自得，以为这是妙策，既可嫁祸于人，又可偷窃财帛。卑鄙龌龊行藏，怎能见得太阳？两罪一下俱发，落得臭名远扬。阴谋鬼计无效，画皮完全剥掉，盟兄盟弟比丑，一样都是强盗！（附图片）
