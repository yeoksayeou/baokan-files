Promoting Wooden Boat Towing

Zhao Li, Deputy Director of Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation

In Sichuan Province, covering 570,000 square kilometers, the network of large and small rivers is as dense as a spider's web. Like a cloud pine, with the Yangtze and Jinsha Rivers as the main body, and the Jia, Fu, Qu, Min, Tuo, and Wu Rivers as its trunk, and 460 small and medium-sized rivers as branches, it stretches 39,000 kilometers, connecting the towns and villages of the 70 million people of the "Land of Abundance". This is a unique natural wealth – the beautiful Sichuan inland river.

These water resources are not only rich and abundant but also comprehensive and diverse, especially prominent in transportation. Since liberation, it has transported 63,019,406 tons of goods, equivalent to 7,227,010,129 ton-kilometers for the country. It has always held an important position in the total transportation volume of provincial transportation tools, accounting for about 70%.

This year, industrial and agricultural production has made repeated leaps forward, and the contradiction between increased transportation volume and insufficient transportation capacity has become increasingly acute. The transportation volume in the second half of this year has increased three to five times compared with the same period in 1957. There is a shortage of 200,000 tons of wooden boats, 5,000 automobiles, 300,000 mass transportation tools, and 360,000 laborers. Due to insufficient transportation capacity and lack of labor, some materials have been stockpiled. Under this situation, the 300,000 transportation workers in the province enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee to "run transportation by the whole party and the whole people, make a great leap forward in technological revolution, comprehensively develop water, land, and air transportation, and make the road network accessible in all directions," and quickly launched a wave of technological revolution. They put forward the heroic battle slogans of "making whatever is lacking, reforming whatever is used, relying on our own efforts, and realizing seven modernizations," "transporting as soon as it arrives, loading and unloading quickly, without stockpiling even a pound or two," "building blast furnaces wherever they are built, repairing roads wherever they are," "producing a ton of steel, transporting a ton of steel," and "fighting hard for three months to double transportation capacity." Sichuan Province's "wooden boat towing" emerged under this battle cry.

Sichuan Province's "wooden boat towing" and "automobile towing" are like birds flying wing to wing, advancing side by side. By the end of September, the province had towed 136,000 tons of wooden boats, accounting for 36% of the province's wooden boats. It is expected that all 380,000 tons of wooden boats in the province will be towed by the end of this month. Now, many special districts have fully realized the towing of wooden boats and have launched high-yield rockets, demonstrating great advantages. For example, the wooden boat towing satellite launched by the Luzhou Qianfeng Wooden Boat Cooperative on September 12th was a large boat with a capacity of 120 tons towing eight large boats carrying a total of 751 tons of materials. It sailed from Luzhou, fought hard for two days, passed 87 dangerous shoals, and avoided six wooden rafts, successfully arriving in Chongqing. This is an unprecedented new initiative.

There are many advantages to implementing wooden boat towing, mainly the following three:

(1) Improving transportation efficiency: According to the experience of Nanbu, Mianyang, Nanchong, Luzhou, and other places, transportation efficiency is generally increased by 30% to 100%. For example, the Nanbu Guangyuan to Nanchong large river boats travel twice a month, while single-row Donghe boats can only travel once. After towing, they are the same as large boats, and transportation efficiency has made a leap forward. Nanchong, Jiangjin, and other places have adopted measures such as removing the swallowtail, removing debris, and family members going ashore, which can increase the load capacity of each boat by two tons. Wusheng and Jiangjin added water retaining boards and live panels, which can increase the load capacity of each boat by six tons, accounting for 19% of the total tonnage. Ships have been transformed from carrying people to carrying goods, and the ship type has been changed to the "seven-in-one" style (a new type of ship manufactured by concentrating the advantages of seven ship types). Guangyuan wooden barges "three-section boats" (used as barges when launching, and the three-section boats are dismantled and loaded onto the main boat when going upstream, because there are fewer goods upstream, making full use of ships lacking labor), and those with conditions use wind power to hang folding sails, and implement self-loading and self-unloading, loading first and unloading later, unloading first and loading later, and using masts as cranes to reduce the time for ships to wait for loading and unloading. It is estimated that the province can increase the transportation capacity of wooden boats by at least 100,000 tons. This huge transportation capacity does not cost the country a penny and can transport 7.2 million tons of steel and other materials for the country.

(2) Reducing costs, saving the country a lot of expenses, and increasing accumulation. According to the experience of Nanbu and Luzhou, costs can be reduced by 30%-50% after towing is implemented. After all the boats in the province are towed, they can accumulate 26.9 million yuan for the country every year.

(3) Saving a large number of laborers, generally saving 30%-50%, up to 56%. Nanbu tows five boats with a total cargo of 44 tons. Originally, it required 25 boatmen to row without towing, but after towing, it only requires 11 people. This not only puts the ships that were originally docked due to lack of labor into production but also prepares labor for the large number of new wooden boats to be built in the future. For example, the Leshan Special District plans to build 55,000 tons of new wooden boats this year, which is one or two times the existing wooden boats. The labor required is all solved by the surplus labor from towing. Not only can the labor force be completely solved, but also the most lacking technical force in Sichuan—the boatmen—have been completely resolved by changing single-row boats to towing. This saves the province nearly 30,000 laborers to engage in other production and construction.

In summary, it shows that wooden boat towing is not only fast but also good and economical. It is a very important leap in solving the shortage of transportation capacity and labor on the current transportation front. It is also a powerful measure to ensure the completion of steel transportation tasks and implement the general line of socialist construction. It creates a solid material foundation for the realization of semi-mechanization and motorization on the water in the future. This innovation not only completed the transportation tasks, cleared the backlog, and won praise from the material departments, but also encouraged the boatmen even more. (Attached photo)

    推广木船拖带化
    四川省交通厅副厅长　 赵理
    在四川全省五十七万平方公里的土地上，密如蛛网般的大小河流，它像一株云松，以长江、金沙江为主体，以嘉、涪、渠、岷、沱、乌六江为躯干，四百六十条中小河流为分枝，纵横三万九千公里，把“天府之国”七千万人民的城镇和乡村联系起来。这就是得天独厚的天然财富——秀丽的四川内河。
    这些水利资源不但是丰富雄厚的，而且是全面多彩的，在交通运输上尤其优异突出。解放来它为国家运送了六千三百零一万九千四百零六吨，七十二亿二千七百零一万零一百二十九吨公里物资。在省属交通工具运输总量中它始终以70％左右的比重居于重要地位。
    今年工农业生产一再跃进，运量大增和运力不足的矛盾日益尖锐。今年下半年的运量比1957年同期增长三至五倍。共差木船二十万吨，汽车五千辆，群运工具三十万部，差劳动力三十六万人。由于运力不足，劳动力缺乏，致造成部分物资积压。在此形势下，全省三十万交通运输职工热烈的响应了中央和省委“全党全民办交通，技术革命大跃进，水陆空综合发展，道路网四通八达”的号召，迅速掀起了技术革命的热潮。提出“缺啥造啥，用啥改啥，自力更生，实现七化”，“随到随运，抢装抢卸，不积压一斤一两”，“高炉建到哪里，道路修到哪里”，“生产一吨钢铁，运一吨钢铁”，“苦战三个月，运力加两翻”等豪迈的战斗口号。四川省的“木船拖挂”，就是在这个战斗的口号下出现的。
    四川省的“木船拖挂”和“汽车拖挂”好像比翼双飞的鸟儿，并肩跃进。到9月底为止全省已进行拖挂的木船已达十三万六千吨，占全省木船的36％，预计到本月底全省三十八万吨木船可全部实现拖挂。现在不少专区已全部实现了木船拖挂化，并射出了高产火箭和显示了巨大优越性。如泸州前锋木船合作社9月12日发射出的木船拖带卫星，是以一只一百二十吨木船拖八只共载七百五十一吨物资的大船，从泸州开航奋战两天，经过八十七个险滩，避让六个木筏胜利到达重庆。这是史无前例的新创举。
    实行木船拖挂的好处很多，主要有以下三个：
      （1）提高运效：根据南部、绵阳、南充、泸州等地经验，运效一般提高30％到一倍。如南部广元至南充大河船每月行驶两个航次，单行的东河船只能行驶一次，实行拖带后与大船相同，运效跃进了一番。南充、江津等地采取去掉燕尾，搬掉杂物，家属上岸等每船可增加载量二吨。武胜和江津加了拦水板活枋后，每船可增加载量六吨，占总吨位的19％。船只由载人转为载货，船型改为“七合一”式（是集中七种船型优点制造的一种新船）广元木驳“三节船”（下水时作驳船，上水时将三节船拆开，装到主船上，因上水货少，充分利用缺劳动力船只），并将有条件利用风力的船挂折子风帆，以及实行自装自卸，先搬后装，先卸后搬，桅杆作吊杆以减少停船待装待卸时间等措施后，估计全省最少增加十万吨以上木船的运力，而这样巨大的运力却不花国家一个钱，可为国家多运钢铁及其它物资七百二十万吨。
      （2）降低成本，节省国家大量开支，增加积累。根据南部和泸州经验，实行拖带后可降低成本30％—50％。全省所有船只实行拖带后，每年可为国家积累二千六百九十万元。
      （3）节约大批劳动力，一般节约30％—50％，最高达56％。南部拖五只船共载物资四十四吨，原来不拖需驾长挠工二十五人，实行拖带后只需十一人。这样不仅把原来因缺乏劳动力而停泊的船只用起来参加了生产，同时，给今后大量新造木船准备了劳动力。如乐山专区今年拟新建木船五万五千吨，为现有木船的一、二倍，所需劳动力全部由拖带节余劳动力中解决。不仅劳动力可全部解决，由于把单行船改为拖带，把四川最缺乏的技术力量——驾长也全部获得了解决。给全省节省近三万个劳动力从事其他生产建设。
    综上所述，说明木船拖带，不仅多快，而且好省，是当前交通战线上解决运力不足和劳动力不足的十分重要的飞跃，也是保证完成钢铁运输任务，贯彻社会主义建设总路线的有力措施，并为今后水上实现半机械化、机动化创造了雄厚的物质条件，这一革新不仅完成了运输任务，扫清了积压，博得物资部门的好评，船运工人也更加鼓舞。（附图片）
