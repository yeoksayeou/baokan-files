Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th. The Lianyuan County of Hunan Province has launched a mass coal mining campaign. On the 10th, the daily output of raw coal reached 15,000 tons, a fourfold increase compared to the end of September, making it the first county in Hunan Province with a daily output of 10,000 tons of raw coal. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately sent a congratulatory letter, encouraging them to continue their efforts and develop coal production more and faster. Currently, the county is actively preparing and determined to strive to reach a daily output of 40,000 tons of raw coal by the end of the month.

With the rapid development of steel production, coal production must keep up. In the past, some county and township cadres in Lianyuan County did not fully recognize the serious significance of vigorously developing coal, so that the day after launching a satellite of daily steel production of 2,513 tons on September 30, 752 indigenous furnaces in the county had to stop production due to lack of fuel. After discovering this problem, the Lianyuan County Party Committee immediately held a meeting and decided to launch a high-yield coal production competition month campaign throughout the county. The First Secretary took charge of coal production and transferred more than half of the 4,700 county, township, and commune cadres engaged in steel production to the coal mining front, where they ate, lived, and worked with the workers. The Party Committees of the communes also organized the masses to speak out freely and conduct great debates, breaking through conservative thinking and "condition-based arguments," as well as individualistic thinking, so that every employee understood the great significance of increasing coal production to support steel production, thereby boosting their soaring enthusiasm.

In the high-yield coal production competition campaign, the Lianyuan County Party Committee resolutely implemented the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy. On the one hand, it adopted the method of old factories leading new factories and iron factories leading coal mines; on the other hand, it adopted the method of blossoming everywhere, actively organizing the masses to open small coal mines. In a very short period, the county's coal mining labor force increased from 35,000 people to more than 90,000; the number of small coal mines in the county increased from 630 at the end of September to 1,431.

    “小、土、群”无坚不摧
    涟源一天产煤一万五千吨
    新华社长沙12日电　湖南省涟源县开展群众性的采煤运动，10日一天原煤产量达到一万五千吨，日产量较9月底提高四倍，成为湖南省第一个原煤万吨县。中共湖南省委当日即发出贺信，勉励他们再接再厉，更多更快地发展煤炭生产。目前，这个县正在积极准备，决心争取月底达到日产原煤四万吨。
    随着钢铁生产的飞跃发展，煤炭生产必须紧紧跟上去。过去涟源县部分县、乡干部对大抓煤炭的严重意义认识不足，以致在9月30日发射钢铁日产二千五百一十三吨的卫星以后的第二天，全县就有七百五十二座土炉因无燃料不得不停止生产。涟源县委发现这一问题后，随即召开会议，决定在全县范围内开展煤炭高产竞赛月运动。第一书记上马抓煤炭，并从四千七百名搞钢铁生产的县、乡、社干部中抽出一半以上的干部，开赴采煤战线，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动。各公社党委还组织群众大鸣大放大辩论，冲破了保守思想和“条件论”，以及个人主义思想，使每个职工认识了增产煤炭，支援钢铁生产的重大意义，从而鼓起了冲天的干劲。
    在煤炭高产竞赛运动中，涟源县委坚决贯彻执行了“小、土、群”的方针，一面采取老厂带新厂、铁厂带煤矿，一面采取遍地开花的办法，积极组织群众，大开小煤窑。在很短期间内，全县采煤劳动力就由三万五千人增加到九万多人；全县的小煤窑由9月底的六百三十处增加到一千四百三十一处。
