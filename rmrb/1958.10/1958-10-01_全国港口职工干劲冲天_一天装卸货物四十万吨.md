National Port Workers Surge with Enthusiasm
    400,000 Tons of Cargo Loaded and Unloaded in a Single Day
    (Our dispatch) Nationwide port workers launched a high-yield "satellite" on September 28th to welcome National Day. On this day, according to statistics from eleven major ports, a total of more than 400,000 tons of cargo was loaded and unloaded, representing 227.74% of the average daily loading and unloading volume in August, more than doubling it. This "satellite" was achieved under the leadership of the Party, thanks to the support of people from all walks of life and the efforts of the vast number of workers.
    "Double loading and unloading, launch satellites" is the bold fighting goal proposed by port workers across the country to welcome National Day. On the 28th, ships loaded with important materials such as pig iron, coke, ore, coking coal, and grain shuttled back and forth along the coast from Dalian in the north to Zhanjiang in the south, along the Yangtze River, from Chongqing in the west to Shanghai in the east. In various ports, crowds and vehicles, and the roar of various loading and unloading machinery, formed an extremely magnificent picture.
    Most notably, the port of Shanghai loaded and unloaded as much as 182,000 tons of cargo on this day (Editor's note: The news on page 2 of this newspaper on the 29th mistakenly stated 100,000 tons), an increase of two times compared to the average daily loading and unloading volume in August. Originally, there were more than 600 large and small cargo ships waiting to be loaded and unloaded at this port, but after a day and night of hard work, not a single ship waiting to be loaded or unloaded could be seen at the port. This is a rare sight in recent days. Dalian Port also created its highest record this year with a loading and unloading volume of more than 34,000 tons on this day. In early September, due to typhoons and heavy rains, a large amount of coal was backlogged in Dalian Port, making it impossible to load it onto ships and transport it to Shanghai, to supply the needs of many iron and steel enterprises in the interior such as Shanghai Steel and Wuhan Steel. After a few days of intensive rush transport, almost all of the coking coal piled up in the port was emptied. The Huangpu and Zhanjiang ports on the South China coast also achieved good results on this day, with loading and unloading volumes doubling compared to the average daily volume in August.
    Now, on the basis of launching satellites, various ports are working hard to welcome the more arduous loading and unloading tasks in October.

### 全国港口职工干劲冲天  一天装卸货物四十万吨

    全国港口职工干劲冲天
    一天装卸货物四十万吨
    本报讯  全国港口职工在9月28日放出一颗高产“卫星”，迎接国庆节。这一天，据十一个主要港口的统计，总共装卸了四十多万吨货物，为8月份平均日装卸量的227.74％，即翻了一番多。这颗“卫星”是在党的领导下，由于各界人民的支援和广大职工的努力而得来的。
    “装卸加番，放出卫星”，这是全国港口职工为迎接国庆节提出的豪迈的奋斗目标。在28日这一天，沿海北自大连南至湛江、长江，西迄重庆东至上海，满载着生铁、焦炭、矿石、炼焦煤以及粮食等重要物资的船舶，川流不息。在各个港口上，人群车流，各种装卸机械的轰鸣，构成了一幅极为壮观的图景。
    最突出的是上海港，这一天装卸的货物高达十八万二千多吨（编者注——29日本报二版消息中误为十万吨），比8月份平均日装卸量增加了二倍。原来在这个港口急待装卸的大小货船有六百多艘，但是，经过人们一昼夜的辛勤劳动，在港上已看不到一艘待装待卸的船只了。这是近些日子来少见的景象。大连港这一天也创造了装卸量三万四千多吨的今年最高纪录。9月上旬，由于台风和大雨的袭击，大量的煤炭积压在大连港内，无法从这里装船运往上海，供应上钢、武钢等关内许多钢铁企业的需要。经过最近几天的突击抢运，堆积在港内的炼焦煤几乎全部运空了。华南沿海的黄浦和湛江两个港口，这一天的成绩也很好，装卸量都比8月份日平均数翻了一番。
    现在各港正在放出卫星的基础上，为迎接10月份更为艰巨的装卸任务而努力。
