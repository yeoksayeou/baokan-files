Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 25th: The first session of the First People's Congress of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region today, officially announcing the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.

    Today was the second day of the congress, with a total of one hundred and eighty-six representatives attending the meeting.

    At today's meeting, Wu Shengxiu, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, delivered a "Report on the Adjustment of the 1958 Financial Budget and the Draft 1959 Financial Budget of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region"; Gan Chunlei, convener of the Representative Qualification Examination Committee, delivered a "Report on the Examination of Representative Qualifications." Subsequently, the meeting conducted elections by secret ballot, electing Liu Geping (Hui) as Chairman of the People's Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Ma Yuhai (Hui), Wu Shengxiu (Han), Wang Jinzhang (Han), Wang Zhiqiang (Hui), Ma Teng'ai (Hui), Hao Yushan (Han), and Huang Zhizhong (Han) as Vice-Chairmen; Li Jinglin (Han), Ma Xin (Hui), Liu Zhenhuan (Hui), Zhu Shengda (Han), Yuan Jinzhang (Han), Jing Boheng (Manchu), Shi Guizhen (Female, Han), and thirty-five others as members; Han Youtong (Female, Hui) was elected as President of the Autonomous Region Higher People's Court, Hu Fenglin (Han) as President of the Yinchuan Intermediate People's Court, and Han Guang (Han) as President of the Guyuan Intermediate People's Court. The congress also elected Liu Geping, Li Jinglin, Ma Yuhai, Ma Teng'ai, and Lei Qilin (Han) as representatives of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to the Second National People's Congress. When the presidium of the congress announced the election results, officially declaring the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the entire venue erupted in prolonged applause.

    Following this, Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke amidst warm applause. He said that the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been officially established today after nearly two years of deliberation, consultation, and preparation. This is a great joyous event for the Hui people and the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region, and also a joyous event for the people of all nationalities throughout the country. He extended warm congratulations to all representatives, the Hui people, and the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. He said that this is another major victory for our Party's nationalities policy and is worthy of our great joy and encouragement.

    He said that the basic policy of our Party in resolving the nationalities issue is to implement national regional autonomy. In recent years, the work of promoting national regional autonomy has achieved tremendous success. Thirty-five minority nationalities have implemented regional autonomy throughout the country, with a total population of more than 25 million, accounting for more than 90% of the population of concentrated minority nationalities. The national regional autonomy policy fully conforms to the actual conditions of our country and the common aspirations of all nationalities and is a key to solving our country's nationalities issue. The fact that national regional autonomy is being promoted among the Hui people fully demonstrates the great superiority of this policy. Because Hui autonomous areas of different sizes have been established in places where Hui people live in concentrated communities, the rights of the Hui people to be masters of their own affairs in managing the internal affairs of their own nationality have been guaranteed, and their enthusiasm and initiative in participating in the socialist construction of the motherland have been greatly stimulated. It has also rapidly eliminated the historical divisions between the Hui and Han nationalities and other nationalities and enhanced mutual trust and unity among all nationalities. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will inspire the people of all nationalities in the autonomous region with greater revolutionary drive, which will be conducive to the cause of socialist construction and enhance national unity. He said that after the establishment of the autonomous region, as long as the masses are fully relied upon under the leadership of the Party, the socialist construction cause of the autonomous region will certainly develop at a high speed, and a bright and brilliant future will certainly be opened up for the autonomous region.

    Xie Fumin, Vice-Chairman of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, said in his speech that the Hui nationality is one of the outstanding members of the motherland's big family and also one of the nationalities with a relatively large population in our country. However, they are distributed throughout the country, and Ningxia is a region where the Hui nationality is relatively concentrated. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is in line with the wishes of the Hui people.

    He said that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of minority nationalities have been liberated with the victory of the revolution. First of all, the system of national oppression was abolished, and equal rights between nationalities were realized. The vast majority of minority nationalities have successively completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation, thoroughly freeing the people of all ethnic groups from the pain of class exploitation, embarked on the prosperous and happy socialist road, and established new relations of equality, unity, unity, and mutual cooperation between nationalities.

    He said that now, the socialist construction cause of the people of all nationalities in our country is running forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years," and the poor and backward face of our country will soon be replaced by a prosperous and strong era.

    Yang Jingren, Vice-Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, said in his speech: The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was established on the basis of the great unity of the Hui and Han people and the great development of socialist cause in the Ningxia region. The establishment of the autonomous region will further promote the close unity of the Hui and Han people and the great leap forward in socialist construction.

    Yang Jingren said: We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the people of all nationalities in the Ningxia region will unite more closely under the leadership of the Party and the government, and will build the autonomous region into an advanced region with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

    The congress also read out congratulatory messages from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the State Council of the People's Republic of China. Xie Fumin, on behalf of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, and Yang Jingren, on behalf of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, presented congratulatory banners to the congress. Then the congress also read out congratulatory telegrams from all over the country.

    The congress will continue to hold meetings on the 27th to discuss and approve various reports and resolutions related to the congress.

    党的民族政策又一重大胜利
    宁夏回族自治区成立
    刘格平当选为自治区主席，马玉槐等七人当选为副主席
    林伯渠同志代表中央向宁夏人民祝贺
    新华社银川25日电　宁夏回族自治区第一届人民代表大会第一次会议，今天选出了宁夏回族自治区人民委员会主席、副主席和委员，宣告宁夏回族自治区正式成立。
    今天是大会的第二天，出席会议的代表共一百八十六人。
    在今天的会议上，宁夏回族自治区筹备委员会副主任吴生秀作了“关于宁夏回族自治区1958年财政预算调整情况和1959年财政预算草案的报告”；代表资格审查委员会召集人甘春雷作了“关于代表资格审查的报告”。接着，会议以无记名投票的方式进行了选举，选出刘格平（回）为宁夏回族自治区人民委员会主席，马玉槐（回）、吴生秀（汉）、王金璋（汉）、王志强
  （回）、马腾霭（回）、郝玉山
  （汉）、黄执中（汉）为副主席；李景林（汉）、马信（回）、刘震寰（回）、朱声达（汉）、袁金章
  （汉）、景伯衡（满）、史桂珍
  （女、汉）等三十五人为委员；选出韩幽桐（女、回）为自治区高级人民法院院长，胡凤林（汉）为银川中级人民法院院长，韩广（汉）为固原中级人民法院院长。大会还同时选出刘格平、李景林、马玉槐、马腾霭、雷启霖（汉）五人为宁夏回族自治区出席第二届全国人民代表大会代表。当大会主席团宣布选举结果，正式宣告宁夏回族自治区成立时，全场响起了经久不息的掌声。
    接着，中共中央政治局委员、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长林伯渠在热烈的掌声中讲了话。他说，宁夏回族自治区经过将近两年的酝酿、协商和筹备，今天正式宣告成立了。这是回族人民和自治区内各民族人民的一件大喜事，也是全国各民族人民的一件喜事。他谨代表中国共产党中央委员会、中央人民政府和毛主席，向各位代表、向回族人民和自治区内各民族人民致以热烈的祝贺。他说，这是我们党的民族政策的又一个重大的胜利，是值得我们大家欢欣鼓舞的。
    他说，我们党解决民族问题的基本政策是实行民族区域自治。几年来，推行民族区域自治的工作已经获得了巨大的成绩。全国实行区域自治的已经有三十五个少数民族，人口共达二千五百多万，约占聚居的少数民族人口的90％以上。民族区域自治政策完全符合我国的实际情况和各民族的共同愿望，是解决我国民族问题的一把钥匙。在回族中推行民族区域自治的事实，就充分证明了这个政策的巨大优越性。由于在各地回民聚居的地方依据聚居地方的大小分别建立了大小不同的回族自治地方，不但保障了回族人民在管理本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利，大大激发了他们参加祖国社会主义建设的积极性和主动精神，而且迅速消除了历史上残留下来的回族和汉族及其他民族间的隔阂，增进了各民族间的互相信任和团结。毫无疑问，宁夏回族自治区的成立，一定会鼓舞起自治区内各民族人民更大的革命干劲，有利于社会主义建设事业和增强民族团结。他说，自治区成立以后，只要能够在党的领导下充分依靠群众，就一定能够使自治区社会主义建设事业高速度地发展起来，就一定能够为自治区开拓出光辉灿烂的前途。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员谢扶民在讲话中说，回族是祖国大家庭中的优秀成员之一，也是我国少数民族人口较多的一个民族。但是他们分布全国各地，宁夏是回族比较聚居的地区。宁夏回族自治区的建立是符合回族人民愿望的。
    他说，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，少数民族人民随着革命的胜利而得到解放。首先废除了民族压迫制度，实现了民族间的平等权利。绝大多数少数民族先后完成了民主改革和社会主义改造，彻底地解除了各族人民的阶级剥削痛苦，走上了繁荣幸福的社会主义道路，建立了民族之间的平等团结统一和互相合作的新关系。
    他说，现在，我国各民族人民的社会主义建设事业正以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前奔跑，我国贫穷落后的面貌也将迅速地被繁荣富强的时代所代替。
    民族事务委员会副主任杨静仁在讲话中说：宁夏回族自治区是在宁夏地区回、汉两族人民大团结和社会主义事业大发展的基础上建立的。而自治区的成立即将更进一步地促进回、汉两族人民的紧密团结和社会主义建设大跃进。
    杨静仁说：我们深信：宁夏回族自治区成立以后，宁夏地区各民族人民在党和政府的领导下，一定会更加紧密地团结起来，尽快地把自治区建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的先进地区。
    大会还宣读了全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中华人民共和国国务院的贺电。由谢扶民代表全国人民代表大会民族委员会、杨静仁代表中华人民共和国民族事务委员会，向大会赠送了贺幛。接着大会还宣读了全国各地各单位打来的贺电。
    大会在27日将继续举行会议，讨论和通过有关大会的各项报告和决议。
