    Quotations
    Of course, the weapon of criticism cannot replace the criticism of weapons; material force can only be overthrown by material force; but theory, once it grasps the masses, also becomes a material force.

    Philosophy takes the proletariat as its material weapon, just as the proletariat takes philosophy as its spiritual weapon.

    Philosophy cannot become a reality without abolishing the proletariat; the proletariat cannot abolish itself without turning philosophy into reality.
                    Marx: Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right

    批判的武器当然不能代替武器的批判，物质力量只能用物质力量来摧毁；但是理论一经掌握群众，也会变成物质力量。
    哲学把无产阶级当做自己的物质武器，同样地，无产阶级也把哲学当做自己的精神武器。
    哲学不消灭无产阶级，就不能成为现实；无产阶级不把哲学变成现实，就不可能消灭自己。
