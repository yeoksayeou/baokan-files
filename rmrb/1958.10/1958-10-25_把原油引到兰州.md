    Bringing Crude Oil to Lanzhou
    The surveying and design work for the oil pipeline from Yumen to Lanzhou has already begun. After this 800-kilometer-long oil pipeline is completed, Northwest crude oil will flow along the Gansu Corridor, over the Wuqiaoling Mountains, to the Lanzhou Refinery, and then be transferred to various parts of the country. The surveying and design work for the Yumen-Lanzhou line will be completed by the end of this year. A national oil pipeline network is being studied and planned, and will be basically completed during the Second Five-Year Plan period. (Chen Zhongxiang)

    把原油引到兰州
    从玉门到兰州的输油管线勘测设计工作已经开始。这条长达八百公里输油管建成以后，西北原油将沿着甘肃走廊，翻过乌鞘岭，流到兰州炼油厂，然后转送全国各地。玉兰线的勘测设计任务将于今年年底完成。全国输油管网正在研究规划，在第二个五年计划期间将基本建成。　（陈忠祥）
