Xinhua News Agency, October 10th: While announcing the complete withdrawal of its invading troops from Lebanon by the end of October, the United States is secretly using all sorts of despicable means to intensify the encouragement of Chamoun elements and Phalange members to engage in disturbances, in order to create an excuse for continuing to delay its troop withdrawal. This is the two-faced tactic the United States is currently playing in Lebanon, and it is the fundamental reason why the situation in Lebanon remains tense.

The United States announced the withdrawal of troops under pressure from the people of Lebanon and world opinion. U.S. President Eisenhower once said: "Whenever the legally constituted Lebanese government requests it, the United States troops will withdraw completely." Now, that day has arrived. Recently, the legally elected Lebanese President Chehab, and the legally appointed Prime Minister Karami, have both requested the U.S. aggressor troops to withdraw by the end of October. This makes it impossible for the U.S. aggressors to quibble or stay put any longer.

However, the facts of the past half-month show that this is only a superficial posture of the United States. It attempts to continue to keep its invading troops in Lebanon by the most shameless means in order to suppress the rising national independence movement in the Middle East. In fact, even before Chamoun stepped down, the United States began this rogue action. At that time, in order to prepare to continue to use his group to serve the United States after Chamoun stepped down, the United States pre-allocated huge sums of money to Chamoun to establish a so-called Free National Party, and provided a batch of weapons to support Chamoun's Phalange and National Socialist Party and other fascist party members.

As soon as the Karami cabinet was formed, and announced that its primary task was to demand the withdrawal of the U.S. invading troops, the United States secretly instigated Chamoun's supporters to immediately begin various provocative sabotage activities, which became more rampant day by day. These bandits frantically and wantonly kidnapped and killed residents, burned houses, forced shops to strike, and disrupted traffic. They frantically demanded the reorganization of the cabinet and demanded that Chamoun's supporters be placed in the new cabinet. The U.S. Embassy in Lebanon admitted that U.S. occupation forces personnel frequently maintained close relations with the Phalange headquarters. Then, the United States blatantly carried out blatant interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon McClintock actually acted as an emperor emeritus, holding a "reception" at the U.S. Embassy, demanding that the Karami government accept the unreasonable demands of the Phalange and give four ministerial positions in the cabinet to the Chamoun group. Recently, in order to cheer on the rampant activities of Chamoun's supporters, the U.S. occupation forces sent tank patrols to the streets to "demonstrate" to the Karami government, and fired cannons on the coast to intimidate the Lebanese people.

According to the pro-Western "Orient Daily," at 9 p.m. on the 8th, thirty-seven U.S. tanks suddenly occupied areas such as the Basta district in Beirut, which were previously controlled by the anti-Chamoun insurgent forces, to intimidate the Lebanese people. U.S. soldiers fired into the air and launched some flares. In addition, they also conducted exercises on the nearby beach at night. U.S. rockets whizzed over the Basta district and exploded violently in the sea.

By the morning of the 9th, some U.S. tanks and military vehicles were still stationed there, surrounding the areas formerly controlled by the insurgents, with artillery and machine guns ready to fire at any time. In addition, they also set up more sentry posts there with sandbags. U.S. military vehicles traveled frequently in the vicinity.

At the same time, according to Damascus newspapers, the U.S. occupation forces reoccupied the road between Beirut Port and Beirut International Airport on the 9th. U.S. patrols continued to operate on the streets of Beirut on the evening of the 9th until late at night.

When the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon and the invading troops used overt and covert, civil and military tactics to bully the Lebanese people and government, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 8th announcing the withdrawal of troops, saying that it would withdraw the U.S. invading troops from Lebanon before the end of October. But it added a condition: "unless unforeseen circumstances arise." Then, on the 9th, it announced that although the provision of the troop withdrawal deadline at the end of October "remains valid," "events in the past twenty-four hours have increased the possibility that some U.S. troops will continue to remain there after that date." U.S. Acting Secretary of Defense Quarles said on the 9th that if Karami resigned, it would "affect" the U.S. troop withdrawal from Lebanon. And what the United States is currently intensifying through the Chamoun group and the U.S. Embassy is precisely to create that kind of "unforeseeable situation" and force Karami to resign!

In fact, this conspiracy of the United States is also in vain. Because no matter what "unforeseeable situation" occurs in Lebanon, the United States does not need to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. If the United States insists on using this as an excuse to refuse to withdraw its troops, then in front of the people of the world, it will use its ugly behavior to make another vivid "self-introduction" to the essence of U.S. imperialism.

    为拖延撤军准备借口
    美国在黎巴嫩制造混乱局面
    唆使夏蒙党徒作乱　侵略军对人民挑衅
    据新华社10日讯　美国一方面宣布在10月底前撤完它在黎巴嫩的侵略军，一方面却暗地用尽一切卑鄙手段加紧纵容夏蒙分子和长枪党徒进行骚动，以为它继续拖延撤军制造借口。这就是美国目前在黎巴嫩玩弄的两面手法，也就是目前黎巴嫩局势继续紧张的根本原因。
    美国宣布撤军是迫于黎巴嫩全国人民和全世界舆论的压力。美国总统艾森豪威尔曾经说过：“不论什么时候，只要合法组成的黎巴嫩政府提出要求，美国军队就将全部撤退。”现在，这一天已经到来了，最近合法选出的黎巴嫩总统谢哈布，合法任命的总理卡拉米都已经要求美国侵略军在10月底前撤走。这就使美国侵略者再也无法狡辩，再也赖不下去了。
    但是半个多月来的事实表明，这只是美国表面的姿态，它企图以最无耻的手段继续使它的侵略军留在黎巴嫩以镇压中东日益高涨的民族独立运动。实际上，早在夏蒙下台以前，美国就开始了这种流氓行动。当时，为了准备在夏蒙下台之后，继续利用他的集团为美国服务，美国预先拨出巨款给夏蒙成立一个所谓自由国民党，并且把一批武器供给支持夏蒙的长枪党和国家社会党等法西斯党徒。
    卡拉米内阁一组成，并宣布其首要任务为要求美国侵略军撤退之后，美国就暗中唆使夏蒙党徒立即开始各种挑衅破坏活动，而且一天比一天猖狂。这些匪徒疯狂地恣意绑架和杀害居民，烧毁房子，强迫商店罢市，破坏交通等。他们猖狂地要求改组内阁，要求新内阁安插夏蒙分子。而美国驻黎巴嫩大使馆承认，美国占领军人员经常同长枪党总部保持密切关系。接着，美国就明目张胆地对黎巴嫩内政进行粗暴的干涉。美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克居然以太上皇自居，在美国大使馆举行“招待会”，要求卡拉米政府接受长枪党提出的无理要求，把内阁中的四个部长职位让给夏蒙集团。最近美国占领军为了替夏蒙党徒的猖狂活动助威，又派了坦克巡逻队到街上向卡拉米政府“示威”，并在海边开炮恫吓黎巴嫩人民。
    据亲西方的“东方报”报道，8日晚上九时，有三十七辆美国坦克突然占领了贝鲁特市内以前由反对夏蒙的起义部队控制的巴斯塔区等地区，对黎巴嫩人民进行恐吓。美国士兵向空中开火，而且还发射了一些照明弹。此外，他们还在晚上在附近的沙滩上进行了演习。美国火箭呼啸过巴斯塔区上空，然后落在海里猛烈爆炸。
    到9日上午，一些美国坦克和军用车辆仍然停在那里，包围着以前起义者控制的地区，大炮和机关枪随时准备着发射。此外，他们还在那里用沙袋设置了更多的岗哨。美军车辆在附近来往频繁。
    同时，据大马士革报纸报道，美国占领军在9日重新占领了贝鲁特港和贝鲁特国际机场之间的道路，美军巡逻队9日晚间继续在贝鲁特街道活动，直到深夜。
    当美国驻黎巴嫩的大使和侵略军用明明暗暗、文武双打等手法来欺侮黎巴嫩人民和政府的时候，美国国务院就在8日发表的宣布撤军的声明说，将在10月底前从黎巴嫩撤退美国侵略军。但附加了一个条件：“除非出现无法预料的局势”。紧接着又在9日宣布说，尽管规定10月底的撤军期限“仍然有效”，但是“最近二十四小时内发生的事件增加了这样的可能性，即某些美国军队将在这个日期以后继续留在那里”。美国代理国防部长卡利斯9日又说，如果卡拉米辞职，那就将“影响”美军撤出黎巴嫩。而美国目前通过夏蒙集团和美国大使馆加紧进行的，恰恰就是制造那种“无法预料的局势”和迫使卡拉米辞职！
    其实美国这种阴谋也是枉费心机。因为不管黎巴嫩发生什么样“无法预料的局势”，也用不着美国来过问黎巴嫩的内政。如果美国硬要把这作为借口而拒绝撤军，那它就将在全世界人民面前，用自己的丑行把美帝国主义的本质再作一次生动的“自我介绍”。
