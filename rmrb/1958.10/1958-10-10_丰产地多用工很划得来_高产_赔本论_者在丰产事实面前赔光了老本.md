    High Yields Justify Increased Labor
    High-Yield "Loss" Theorists Lose Their Shirts in the Face of Bumper Harvest Facts
    (Our Dispatch) This year, the people of Shandong have achieved a great victory on the agricultural front. The total grain output has increased more than twofold compared to last year's 25.3 billion jin. This has given those who sat on the sidelines and the "autumn reckoning" faction a bloody nose, and they no longer say people are "bragging." However, recently, there has been a trend of saying that high-yield bumper harvests are not worthwhile. Some people are saying things like "10,000 jin of grain for 1,000 workdays is not cost-effective," or using the excuse of tight labor to say that deep plowing and autumn sowing cannot be arranged according to specifications, and some county-level officials are even planning to lower the specifications for deep-plowed land stipulated by the provincial party committee. In essence, this kind of argument is the lingering influence of right-leaning conservative thinking. Although this argument is individual in the province as a whole, there are many people spreading this erroneous argument in some areas. It has played a certain role in hindering the current deep plowing and autumn sowing campaign.
    What is the truth of the matter? Is it really not cost-effective to use more labor even if the yield is high? Many facts have provided the best possible answer. First, let's look at the labor input and increased production comparison of spring corn in the Taiqian Commune of Shou Zhang County. According to a survey by this commune: 1. Labor input for a yield of 10,000 to 20,000 jin of corn per mu: (1) Land preparation - deep plowing or digging with shovels to a depth of two to five feet, harrowing eight times, and repairing ridges, totaling an average of 25.3 man-days and 1.5 animal-days. (2) Fertilization - 100,000 to 150,000 jin of base fertilizer and 50,000 jin of top dressing, totaling an average of 67.5 man-days. (3) Sowing - drilling, seed treatment, and pressing after sowing, totaling an average of 1.83 man-days and 0.33 animal-days. (4) Field management - watering eight times using 14.2 man-days, cultivating six times using 2.3 man-days, thinning and weeding twice using 2 man-days, pest control eleven times using 4.5 man-days, and artificial pollination three times using 4 man-days. (5) Harvesting - averaging 9.8 man-days. The total is 133.26 man-days.
    2. Labor input for a yield of 7,000 jin: (1) Land preparation - deep plowing to a depth of three feet, harrowing eight times, and repairing ridges, totaling 30 man-days. (2) Fertilization - 100,000 jin of base fertilizer and 30,000 jin of top dressing, totaling 55 man-days. (3) Sowing - drilling, seed treatment, and pressing after sowing, totaling 1.9 man-days and 0.4 animal-days. (4) Field management - watering five times using 12 man-days, cultivating six times using 2 man-days, thinning and weeding twice using 2 man-days, pest control eleven times using 6 man-days, and artificial pollination three times using 4 man-days. (5) Harvesting - from harvesting to grain entering the warehouse, totaling 10.5 man-days. The total is 123.8 man-days.
    3. Labor input for a yield of 1,300 jin: (1) Land preparation - harrowing eight times and plowing once, using 2.8 man-days and 2.8 animal-days. (2) Fertilization - 20,000 jin of base fertilizer and 500 jin of top dressing, using 12 man-days. (3) Sowing - drilling and pressing after sowing, using 0.9 man-days and 0.4 animal-days. (4) Field management - watering three times, cultivating and earthing up six times, thinning and weeding twice, pest control three times, and artificial pollination twice, totaling 19 man-days. (5) Harvesting - using 4.5 man-days. The total is 42.4 man-days.
    The above three different yields and different amounts of labor tell people that the average labor input for spring corn yielding 10,000 to 20,000 jin per mu is 90.68 man-days more than that for a yield of 1,300 jin per mu, that is, more than twice as much labor, but the yield increases by more than six to fourteen times; the labor input is about 10 man-days more than that for a yield of 7,000 jin, and the yield increases by 3,000 to 13,000 jin.
    Spring corn is like this, and isn't it the same for millet and summer corn? The millet in Taiqian Commune, Shou Zhang County, which yields more than 20,000 jin per mu, uses an average of 163 man-days per mu, more than 10,000 jin uses 146 man-days, and 800 jin uses 34.8 man-days. The millet yielding 20,000 jin uses 128.4 man-days more than that yielding 800 jin, that is, more than three times as much labor, but the yield increases by 24 times; it uses 17 man-days more than that yielding 10,000 jin, and the yield increases by one time.
    From the comparison of labor input and increased output value of sweet potato (sweet potato) planting, it also strongly refutes the argument that "high yield is a loss, and low yield is more worthwhile." The situations in the "July 1st" Commune of Licheng County and the Taiqian Commune of Shou Zhang County are: The average labor input for a yield of 300,000 to 600,000 jin per mu (estimated, same below) is 148.78 man-days; the average labor input for a yield of 50,000 to 150,000 jin per mu is 115.37 man-days; the average labor input for a yield of 5,000 to 10,000 jin per mu is 40.69 man-days. It seems that the spring sweet potatoes yielding 300,000 to 600,000 jin use 108 man-days more than those yielding 5,000 to 10,000 jin, that is, 2.5 times more labor, but the increase in yield is not several times but dozens of times; if compared with those yielding 50,000 to 150,000 jin, although 33.3 man-days are used more, that is, 0.3 times more labor; The increase in production is also considerable. Don't these facts clearly show that the higher the yield, the less labor is used? Doesn't it show that high yield is not only not a loss, but a great deal? What is the similarity between this and the argument that "10,000 jin of grain per 1,000 man-days is not worthwhile" and "high yield is not as good as low yield"? Just when people are happily celebrating the harvest and vigorously engaging in autumn planting, I would like to advise those "well-meaning people" who can calculate and those who have serious conservative ideas to put away their out-of-tune tunes and open their eyes to see the facts of high yield. Let these iron facts wash the brains of the conservatives! (Zhu Yuemei)

    丰产地多用工很划得来
    高产“赔本论”者在丰产事实面前赔光了老本
    本报讯　山东人民今年在农业战线上取得伟大的胜利，粮食总产量比去年的二百五十三亿斤增产二倍多。打得观潮派、秋后算账派鼻青眼肿，再不说人们是在“吹牛”了。但是，最近又有一种搞高额丰产合不来的论调，这些人不是说“万斤粮千个工不合算”，就是借口劳力紧，要按规格深翻秋种农活不好安排，个别的县级负责人甚至打算降低省委规定的深翻地的规格等等。这种论调，实质上就是留恋“广 种薄收”的右倾保守思想在作怪。在全省来说，虽然这种论调是个别的，但在某些地区，传播这种错误论调的却大有人在。它对当前正在开展着的深翻秋种运动，起了一定的促退作用。
    事实的真相究竟如何呢？是不是用工多了即便产量高也不合算呢？这个问题，许多事实作了最好不过的答复。首先请看寿张县台前社春玉米的用工量和增产的比较情况。据这个社的调查：一、亩产一万到二万斤玉米的用工量：（1）整地——用锨深翻或掘刨二至五尺深，耙耢八次，修整畦田共计平均用人工二十五点三个，平均用畜工一点五个。（2）施肥——基肥十万到十五万斤，追肥五万斤，共计平均用人工六十七点五个。（3）播种——耧播、种子处理、播后顿压，共计平均用人工一点八三个，畜工零点三三个。（4）田间管理——浇水八次用工十四点二个，中耕六次用工二点三个，间苗拔草二次用工二个，治虫十一次用工四点五个，人工授粉三次用工四个。（5）收获——平均用人工九点八个。总计用人工一百三十三点二六个。
    二、亩产七千斤的用工量：（1）整地——深翻三尺，耙耢八次，修好畦田，共用人工三十个。（2）施肥——基肥十万斤，追肥三万斤，共用工五十五个。（3）播种——耧播、种子处理、播后顿压，共用人工一点九个，畜工零点四个。（4）田间管理——浇水五次用工十二个，中耕六次用工二个，间苗拔草二次用工二个，治虫十一次用工六个，人工授粉三次用工四个。（5）收获——从收割到粮食入仓，共用工十点五个。总计用人工一百二十三点八个。
    三、亩产一千三百斤的用工量：（1）整地——耙耢八次，耕地一次，用人工二点八个，畜工二点八个。（2）施肥——基肥二万斤，追肥五百斤，用工十二个。（3）播种——耧播、播后顿压，用人工零点九个，畜工零点四个。（4）田间管理——浇水三次，中耕培土六次，间苗拔草二次，治虫三次，人工授粉二次，共用工十九个。（5）收获——用工四点五个。总计用工四十二点四个。
    上面的三种不同产量和不同用工数量，告诉人们，亩产一万至二万斤的春玉米，平均用工量比亩产一千三百斤的多用工九十点六八个，即多用二倍多，但产量则增加六到十四倍多；比亩产七千斤的多用工约十个，产量则增长三千到一万三千斤。
    春玉米是这样，谷子和夏玉米何尝不是如此。寿张县台前社亩产二万斤以上的谷子，平均每亩用工一百六十三个，亩产万斤以上的用工一百四十六个，亩产八百斤的用工三十四点八个。亩产二万斤的比亩产八百斤的多用工一百二十八点四个，即多用三倍多，但产量则增加了二十四倍；比亩产一万斤多用十七个工，而产量则增加一倍。
    从种植地瓜（甘薯）用工量和增产值比较情况看，也有力地驳倒了那种认为“搞高产是赔本，不如搞低产划得来”的论调。历城县“七一”社和寿张县台前社的情况是：亩产三十万到六十万斤（估产，下同）的用工量平均是一百四十八点七八个；亩产五万到十五万斤的用工量平均是一百一十五点三七个；亩产五千到一万斤的用工量平均是四十点六九个。看来亩产三十到六十万斤的春地瓜比亩产五千到一万的是多用了一百零八个工，即多用二点五倍，但产量的增加，则不是几倍而是几十倍了；如果和亩产五万到十五万斤的相比，虽多用工三十三点三个，即多用零点三倍；而产量的增加也是相当可观的。这些事实，不是再清楚不过地说明产量愈高，用工愈少吗？不是说明搞高产不仅不是赔本，而是大大的划得来吗？这和那些弹“万斤粮千个工划不得”、“搞高产不如搞低产划得来”的论调有什么相同呢？正当人们欢欢喜喜庆丰收，轰轰烈烈搞秋种的时候，奉劝那些会算账的“好心人”和存有严重保守思想的人们把不合韵律的调子收起来，睁大眼睛看看丰产的事实。还是让这些铁的事实来洗刷保守主义者的脑袋吧！　（朱曰梅）
