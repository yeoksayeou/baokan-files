    Not Benefiting, Yet Bearing the Burden
    Praiseworthy Communist Actions

    The theoretical publication "Masses," sponsored by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, published two articles in its fourth issue praising the communist spirit. One article, titled "The Communist Style on the Erhe Construction Site," reported on the communist spirit demonstrated by farmers in the Huai-Shu River excavation project. The direct beneficiaries of this project were the people of the Huaiyin area, but the 100,000-strong labor force on the construction site were not from Huaiyin, but were full-time migrant workers from the Nantong, Yangzhou, and Yancheng regions. They broke the boundary of "whoever benefits, bears the burden." They said, "A loss in Huaiyin is our reduction in production, and an increase in Huaiyin is our bumper harvest." Junfa Township in Rugao County originally planned to send 150 migrant workers, but 646 people signed up. Migrant workers from Qidong and Haimen in the Nantong region brought thousands of catties of Dai character cotton seeds from their homes as gifts for the local masses, and selected people with high cotton planting skills to help local cadres plant experimental fields. The other article, titled "The Spirit of Cooperation Shines Radiantly," wrote about the communist cooperative thinking of workers. The Suzhou Minfeng Su Boiler Farm Implement Factory, despite having very heavy production tasks, still actively supported other units. Over a period of more than a month, it sent 321 technicians to other units to rush-produce 245 furnace shells and bottoms, and train 1,372 furnace workers. Some workers worked day and night for this, and did not rest even when they were sick. They said, "The difficulties of others are our own difficulties; making other factories better is making our own factory better."

    The editors of the publication wrote an article titled "Praiseworthy Communist Actions," saying: These two articles are exciting to read, and the glorious communist ideology touches people's hearts. For such infectious communist teaching materials, we should not only widely disseminate them, but also further mobilize everyone to write about them extensively from all aspects, fully reflect the wonderful things about the growth of communist morality and qualities, make them known to every household, and carry them forward.

    不受益　也负担
    可歌可颂的共产主义行动
    在中共江苏省委主办的理论刊物“群众”第四期上登载了两篇歌颂共产主义风格的文章。一篇题为“二河工地上的共产主义风格”，报道了开挖淮沭河工程中，农民表现的共产主义精神，这个工程直接受益的是淮阴地区人民，但工地上的十万劳动大军，都不是淮阴人，而是来自南通、扬州、盐城三个专区的常备民工。他们打破了“谁受益，谁负担”的界限，他们说：“淮阴地区的失收，就是我们的减产，淮阴地区的增产，就是我们的丰收。”如皋县俊发乡原定出一百五十个民工，报名的就有六百四十六人。南通专区的启东、海门的民工，从家里带来数千斤岱字棉棉种，作为礼物送给当地群众，并选出植棉技术高的人，帮助当地干部种试验田。另一篇题为“协作精神光芒四射”，写工人的共产主义协作思想。苏州民丰苏锅农具厂在生产任务十分繁重的情况下，仍积极支援别的单位，在一个多月时间，派出技工三百二十一人次，为别的单位赶制炉壳、炉底二百四十五只，培训炉工一千三百七十二名。有的工人为此夜以继日地工作，病了也不休息。他们说：“别人的困难，就是自己的困难；搞好别的厂，就是搞好自己的厂。”
    刊物的编者写了一篇题为“可歌可颂的共产主义行动”的文章中说：这两篇文章，读起来令人心情激动，光辉灿烂的共产主义思想扣动着人们的心弦。对于这样富有感染力的共产主义的教材，我们不仅要广为传诵，而且还要进一步发动大家从各方面来大书特书，把共产主义道德品质增长的美事，充分地反映出来，使之家喻户晓，发扬光大。
