    Homemade Methods, Electroslag Welding
    Small Pieces Make Big Not Difficult!
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to promote electroslag welding as quickly as possible to meet the needs of the rapid development of heavy machinery, the Welding Research Institute of the Mechanical Manufacturing and Technology Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, together with the Welding Teaching and Research Section of Harbin Institute of Technology, worked hard, learned from the Soviet Union, and developed a bold and daring communist spirit, successfully manufacturing “homemade” equipment such as manual plate electrode electroslag welding machines and stepless variable speed consumable nozzle electroslag welding machines. Using this equipment, they successively and successfully welded 50mm, 100mm, and 120mm thick workpieces with trapezoidal cross-section electroslag welds, and will further test electroslag welds of workpieces with greater thickness and more complex cross-sectional shapes.
    The successful testing of plate electrode electroslag welding and consumable nozzle electroslag welding dispelled the mystified view that mastering this cutting-edge technology requires complex and formal electroslag welding equipment, and opened up a broad path for solving the problem of insufficient large-scale casting and forging capacity in the heavy machinery manufacturing industry, and for the composite process of "turning the big into the small, and combining the small into the big."
    At the same time, these two units also tested and mastered the manual electroslag welding repair of nodular cast iron and gray cast iron, as well as the manual electroslag welding of large-section ingot materials or rebar.

    土办法  电渣焊
    小拼大并不难！
    本报讯　为了尽快推广电渣焊，以适应当前重型机器迅速发展的需要，第一机械工业部机械制造与工艺科学研究院焊接研究所与哈尔滨工业大学焊接教研室共同努力在学习苏联的基础上，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，自制成功了手动板极电渣焊机、无级变速熔咀电渣焊机等
  “土”设备。用这种设备相继成功地焊接了五十公厘、一百公厘、一百二十公厘厚度及断面为梯形的工件的电渣焊焊缝，并将进一步试验厚度更大、断面形状更复杂的工件的电渣焊。
    板极电渣焊及熔咀电渣焊的试验成功，破除了没有复杂的正规的电渣焊设备就不能掌握这一尖端技术的神秘观点，为解决重型机器制造业大型铸锻能力不足的问题，为“化大为小，拼小成大”的复合工艺打开了一条广阔的道路。
    与此同时，这两个单位还试验并掌握了球墨铸铁、灰铸铁的手工电渣焊焊补及大断面捧料或钢筋的手工电渣焊焊接。
