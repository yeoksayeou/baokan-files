Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd, Konakry Dispatch: Another new nation has been born in Africa. The people of Guinea in West Africa, who rejected De Gaulle's constitution in the September 28th "referendum," have declared independence.

Guinea's Prime Minister Sékou Touré announced at a press conference in Konakry on the 1st that the Guinean Consultative Assembly would convene on the 2nd as a constituent assembly to begin drafting Guinea's constitution.

Touré said that Guinea wants independence and accepts all the consequences that result from it. Touré's statement is related to France's threats against Guinea. After the Guinean people voted against De Gaulle's constitution on the 28th, the French government notified Guinea on the 29th that it would no longer be able to receive French financial or administrative "assistance."

Touré said that independent Guinea will formulate its foreign policy in accordance with its own interests.

Touré stated that Guinea is willing to unite with France and seek assistance from France, but if France disappoints Guinea, Guinea will be forced to adopt another attitude.

Touré also said that Guinea will establish connections with Ghana, Liberia, Portuguese Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria.

France has not yet formally recognized Guinea's independence.

Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd, Accra Dispatch: The Ghanaian government announced on the evening of the 1st that it recognized the newly declared independent African country of Guinea.

In addition, New York Dispatch: The African countries group within the United Nations issued a statement on the same day, warmly welcoming Guinea's declaration of independence. (Picture Attached)

    结束殖民地历史　不要戴高乐宪法
    几内亚宣布独立
    新华社2日讯　科纳克里消息：非洲又诞生了一个新的国家。在9月28日的“公民投票”中拒绝了戴高乐宪法的西非几内亚人民已经宣布独立。
    几内亚总理杜尔1日在科纳克里举行的记者招待会上宣布，几内亚协商会议将于2日作为制宪议会举行会议，以开始制订几内亚的宪法。
    杜尔说，几内亚要独立，并且接受一切因此所产生的后果。杜尔这句话是同法国对几内亚的威胁有关的。在几内亚人民28日投票反对戴高乐宪法以后，法国政府在29日就通知几内亚说，它不再能够得到法国的财政或行政“援助”。
    杜尔说，独立后的几内亚将按照自己的利益来制订外交政策。
    杜尔表示，几内亚愿意同法国联合，并从法国寻求援助，但是如果法国使几内亚失望，几内亚将被迫采取另一种态度。
    杜尔还说，几内亚将同加纳、利比里亚、葡属几内亚、塞拉勒窝内和尼日利亚建立联系。
    法国到现在为止还没有正式承认几内亚独立。
    新华社2日讯　据来自阿克拉的消息，加纳政府1日晚宣布承认新近宣布独立的非洲国家几内亚。
    另外，据来自纽约的消息，联合国内的非洲国家集团同一天发表声明，热烈欢迎几内亚的宣布独立。（附图片）
