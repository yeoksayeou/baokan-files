    Quotations on Religion

    Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people.
    The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up illusions about the existing state of affairs is the demand to give up a state of affairs which needs illusions. Criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.
                        Marx: "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right"

    Only when the practical everyday relations of man become transparent and reasonable in their dealings with each other and with nature, can the earthly root of religion generally vanish. Only when society controls the process of life production, i.e., the material production process, which is now ruled by chance and beyond human control, through free social association and conscious regulation, can it shed its mysterious veil.
                                  Marx: "Das Kapital"

    If society takes possession of the means of production and applies them in planned fashion, thus freeing itself and all its members from the bondage in which they are now held captive by the means of production, which, though created by themselves, confront them as an alien force; if, in short, man no longer merely proposes, but also disposes—only then will the last alien force which is still reflected in religion vanish; and with it will also vanish the religious reflection itself, for the simple reason that then there will be nothing left to reflect.
                                Engels: "Anti-Dühring"

    The most profound root of religion today is the social oppression of the toiling masses, their apparent helplessness in the face of the blind forces of capitalism, which every day and every hour inflicts upon ordinary, working people suffering a thousand times greater than that inflicted by extraordinary events, such as wars, earthquakes, etc. “Fear created gods.” Fear of the blind force of capital—blind because it cannot be foreseen by the mass of the people—a force which at every step in life threatens to inflict, and does inflict, “sudden,” “unexpected,” “accidental” ruin, bringing in its train unemployment, starvation, death, is the source of modern religion.
                      Lenin: "The Attitude of the Workers' Party to Religion"

    The most important thing, which is often forgotten by those Communists who seem to be Marxists but who do not take the trouble to think out the matter, is to rouse in the minds of the backward masses an intelligent attitude towards religion, an intelligent criticism of religion.
                        Lenin: "On the Significance of Militant Materialism"

    The Party cannot be neutral towards religion, and it conducts anti-religious propaganda against all religious prejudices because it stands for science, while religious prejudices run counter to science, because religious prejudices are a reliable means of keeping the toiling masses in bondage to those who exploit them.
        —Stalin: "Talk with the First American Labor Delegation"

    关于宗教的语录
    宗教的贫困，一方面是现实贫困的表现，一方面又是对现实贫困的反抗。宗教是苦难者的呻吟，是毫无心肝的世界的情操，是缺乏精神的状态的精神。它是人民的鸦片烟。
    作为人民虚幻幸福的宗教之扬弃，就是人民真实幸福的要求之提出。抛弃那笼罩着人民生活状态的幻想之要求，就是抛弃那依靠幻想而存在的状态之要求。所以，对宗教的批判，胎子里是对人间苦海的批判，而人间苦海的圣光则是宗教。
                        马克思：“黑格尔法哲学批判”
    只有到了人们的实际日常生活关系发展成为他们彼此之间和他们与自然之间的明朗而合理的关系时，现实世界的宗教反映，一般地才会归于消灭。只有当社会生活过程的制度，即生活中的物质生产过程的制度，变成人们的自由社会联盟的产物，并处于人们自觉而有计划的监督之下的时候，这生产过程的制度，才会从其自身摈除神秘朦胧的外衣。
                                  马克思：“资本论”
    如果社会掌握了全部生产资料，并加以有计划的运用，因而使自己及一切社会成员摆脱了奴役状态——直到现在，社会成员自己所生产、但与自己相对立的生产资料，是作为压倒的外力来把他们控制于这种奴役状态之中的——，就是说，如果人不再只是“谋事”，而且也能“成事”，只有在这时候，现在还反映于宗教中的最后的外力，才归于消灭，因而宗教反映的本身也才归于消灭，原因很简单，因为到那时再也没有可被反映的东西了。
                                恩格斯：“反杜林论”
    劳动群众在社会上备受压制，他们在资本主义的盲目势力面前，在这些时时刻刻使普通劳动民众受到比任何一种非常事变，如战争、地震等等所引起的最大灾难和最大苦痛还要厉害千倍的盲目势力面前似乎毫无办法，这就是现在最深刻的宗教根源。“恐怖造成上帝”。现代宗教的根源就是对资本盲目势力的一种恐怖心理。
                      列宁：“工人政党对宗教的态度”
    最重要的事情，也是我们那些似乎是信仰马克思主义而事实上却在歪曲马克思主义的共产党员往往忽视的事情，就是要善于唤起最落后的群众自觉地对待宗教问题，自觉地批评宗教。
                        列宁“论战斗唯物主义的意义”
    党对宗教偏见不能采取中立态度，并且要进行反对这些偏见的宣传，因为这是清除那些支持剥削阶级、劝人顺从剥削阶级的反动僧侣的影响的一种可靠手段。
        ——斯大林：“和第一个美国工人代表团的谈话”
