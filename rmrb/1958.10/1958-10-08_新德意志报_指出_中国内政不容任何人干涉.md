Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th. The "Neues Deutschland" today published a commentary on the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" issued by our Minister of National Defense, Peng Dehuai, saying that China's suggestion that the Chiang Kai-shek Group in Taiwan peacefully resolve China's internal affairs through talks, and that negotiations between the two sides on this issue should not include interference from anyone, including the United States. The commentary emphasized that the People's Republic of China has already pointed out a path to a bloodless and peaceful resolution of the issue, and the problem now lies with Chiang Kai-shek.

　　The commentary continued, Minister Peng Dehuai’s message to the Taiwan compatriots once again emphasized to world public opinion that only the two sides of China have the right to resolve China's internal affairs.

　　Commenting on the military provocation policy of the American aggressors in the Taiwan Strait area, the commentary said that the United States should quickly transport its troops in Taiwan back home. Only when the American troops withdraw from Taiwan can the path to peaceful resolution be viable. This is precisely the theme of the Warsaw ambassadorial-level talks, and other issues have nothing to do with the United States.

    “新德意志报”指出
    中国内政不容任何人干涉
    新华社柏林7日电　“新德意志报”今天就我国国防部长彭德怀发表告台湾同胞书发表评论说，中国建议台湾蒋介石集团通过会谈来和平解决中国内政问题，双方之间在这个问题上的谈判是不许包括美国在内的任何人干涉的。评论强调指出，中华人民共和国已经指出了一条不流血的和平解决问题的道路，现在的问题就在于蒋介石了。
    评论接着说，彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书表明，中国再一次向全世界舆论界强调指出，只有中国双方有权解决中国内政问题。
    评论在谈到美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅政策时说，美国应该把它在台湾的军队赶快运回老家去。只有美国军队撤出台湾，和平解决之路才行得通，这正是华沙大使级会谈的主题，其它问题同美国毫无关系。
