    Our country's coal industry front has launched a high-yield "satellite." In September, the national output of raw coal reached 23,864,400 tons (including 14,300,000 tons of coking coal), exceeding the monthly output of Britain. The average daily output was 795,400 tons, an increase of 28.2% compared to August. On September 29th, the national coal output broke through the one million ton mark.
    In the high-yield movement of "producing more coking coal, producing coking coal faster," provinces, counties, and mines launched a red flag competition. New records continued to appear, and various indicators were repeatedly broken, with many moving new scenes appearing in various coal mines. Liaoning Province, a national producer of coking coal, created a high-yield record of 213,000 tons on September 29th, more than double the average daily output in August, with the Beipiao Coal Mine, which produces coking coal, increasing by nearly two and a half times.
    The well-known Kailuan Coal Mine workers held a mobilization meeting on September 21st to pledge increased production for the entire mining area. After several days of hard work, they finally created a high-yield record of 55,290 tons on September 26th, an increase of 45% compared to the average daily output in early September. In the high-yield movement, this mining area also saw five high-yield working faces with monthly outputs of more than 30,000 tons. Among them, the 5299 working face of Tangjiazhuang Mine, after setting a new world record for monthly coal mining of 55,000 tons in August, created an even higher new record of more than 62,000 tons in September.
    Small coal kilns blooming everywhere, in order to meet the needs of the numerous small blast furnaces for coking coal, are also showing their prowess in production. In Baofeng County, Henan, the county party secretary personally took command and led an army of 23,000 people to the mountains to open mines, with daily coal production jumping from the original 70 tons to 7,900 tons. In Shanxi Province, the "sea of coal," four counties, including Jincheng, Gaoping, Yangcheng, and Pinding, also appeared in September with a daily output of 10,000 tons of coal.
    At present, all coal mine workers are confidently advancing on the crest of victory, determined to produce more coal and provide the steel marshal with a full meal.

    原煤产量超过英国月产水平
    9月29日日产量突破百万吨大关
    本报讯　我国煤炭工业战线上的高产“卫星”腾空而起。9月份，全国原煤产量达到二千三百八十六万四千吨（其中炼焦煤一千四百三十万吨），已超过英国月产水平。平均日产量七十九万五千四百吨，比8月份提高28.2％。9月29日这一天，全国煤炭产量已突破了百万吨大关。
    在“多出焦煤，快出焦煤”的高产运动中，省与省、县与县、矿与矿展开了夺红旗竞赛。新纪录不断出现，各项指标一再被突破，各个煤矿出现了许多动人的新气象。全国盛产炼焦煤的辽宁省于9月29日创造了日产二十一万三千吨的高产纪录，比8月份平均日产量提高两倍多，其中产炼焦煤的北票煤矿提高将近二倍半。
    全国闻名的开滦煤矿职工，在9月21日召开了全矿区增产誓师大会。经过数日的苦战，终于在9月26日创造了日产五万五千二百九十吨的高产纪录，这个纪录比9月上旬平均日产提高45％。这个矿区在高产运动中还出现了月产三万吨以上的高产工作面五个，其中唐家庄矿5299工作面继8月份创月产五万五千吨世界采煤新纪录之后，在9月份又创造了月产六万二千多吨的更高新纪录。
    遍地开花的小煤窑，为了满足星罗棋布小高炉对炼焦煤的需要，也都在生产上大显神威。河南宝丰县由县委书记亲自挂帅，率领两万三千人的大军上山开矿，日产煤由原来的七十吨一跃而达七千九百吨。在煤海——山西省，9月份也出现了晋城、高平、阳城和平定等四个日产万吨煤县。
    目前，全体煤矿职工正信心百倍地乘胜前进，决心生产更多的煤炭，让钢铁元帅饱食美餐。
