    Using Tree Trunks as Pillars, Straw as Factory Roofs
    Many Schools in Shaanxi Diligently Run Factories
    (Our Correspondent Qi Yuanzhen reports) Universities and secondary vocational schools in Shaanxi Province have built 1,600 factories by adopting methods such as not buying or buying fewer new materials, making full use of existing equipment or substitutes, and borrowing equipment from other departments. In just over a month, they have produced more than 4,000 new products. Three schools, including Shaanxi Normal University, alone have 76 new products that have reached international or advanced domestic levels. Teachers and students at Xi'an Foreign Language Institute used trees as pillars and covered them with straw to create factory buildings. They used broken bricks and tiles to build boilers and found two or three broken pots to build a fertilizer factory. This fertilizer factory has already produced more than 100 kinds of local fertilizers.
    Under extremely simple equipment and very weak technical forces, teachers and students of various schools have trial-produced hundreds and thousands of new products. Three liberal arts universities alone manufactured nearly 2,000 new products. When young teachers at Shaanxi Normal University started coke production, some professors asserted that with the existing equipment and manpower, it was impossible to produce coke. A complete set of machinery and senior technicians were required. However, after repeated experiments, the young teachers finally produced the first batch of coke. Now, their newly built coke plant with an annual output of 400 tons has been officially put into production.
    The establishment of these factories has also resurrected many waste products, and things that were once considered useless have become valuable assets. Teachers and students at Xi'an Foreign Language Institute used simple tools such as existing hammers, drills, and pliers to repair a scrapped car and scattered bicycle parts into a large truck and two bicycles. Students at Shaanxi Normal University used waste hemp rope ends to make pure white "artificial wool."
    Now, some of these factories have begun mass production. After the steelmaking furnace at Jiaotong University continuously produced seven kinds of steel, including low-carbon steel and tool steel, it was recently expanded into a joint iron and steel enterprise and officially started production. The school's comprehensive radio factory accepted the task of producing 450 radios and has already completed 150, with the quality fully meeting the standards.
    In the process of running factories, these schools experienced a struggle between two lines and two approaches. At the beginning, some experts and professors only wanted to run large, new, comprehensive factories and were unwilling to engage in small, old, and professionally integrated factories. They believed that good equipment was necessary to produce good products. Therefore, whenever they talked about running factories, they would reach out to the state for money, people, and equipment. After the debate, everyone made it clear that it was necessary to adhere to the policy of starting from the simple and economical, and diligently running factories, and to implement the spirit of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, as well as both indigenous and foreign methods. This quickly set off a surge of factory construction.

### 树杆当柱子　稻草盖厂房  陕西许多学校勤俭办厂

    树杆当柱子　稻草盖厂房
    陕西许多学校勤俭办厂
    本报讯　记者戚元珍报道：陕西省高等学校和中等专业学校在大办工厂中，采取了不买或少买新材料，充分利用现有设备或代用品和借用其他部门的设备等办法，办了一千六百座工厂。一个多月来，生产了四千多种新产品。仅陕西师范学院等三个学校就有七十六种新产品达到国际水平和国内先进水平。西安外语学院的师生用树当柱子，上面盖些稻草就成了厂房，用残砖碎瓦砌起锅炉，找了两三口破锅，建成了化肥厂。这个化肥厂已经生产了一百多种土化肥。
    各校师生在设备极其简陋和技术力量非常薄弱的情况下，试制出了成百上千种新产品。仅三个文科高等学校制造的新产品就近二千件。陕西省师范学院的青年教师开始炼焦时，有的教授肯定地说，现有的设备和人力根本不可能炼出焦来，必须有一套完整的机器设备和高级技术人员才行。但是，青年教师们经过反复试验，终于炼出了第一炉焦。现在他们新建的年产四百吨的炼焦厂已经正式投入生产了。
    这些工厂的建立，还使许多废品开始复活，过去认为没有用的东西变成了宝贵的财富。西安外语学院的师生，用现有的锤、钻、老虎钳等简单的工具把原来已经报废的一辆汽车和七零八散的自行车零件修复成了一辆大卡车和两辆自行车。陕西师范学院的学生用烂麻绳头制出洁白的“人造羊毛”。
    现在，这些工厂有些已经开始了大批生产。交通大学的炼钢炉接连炼出了低炭钢、工具钢等七种钢以后，最近又扩建成钢铁联合企业，开始正式生产。这个学校无线电综合工厂接受生产四百五十架收音机任务，已经完成了一百五十架，质量完全合乎标准。
    这些学校在办工厂中，经过了两条道路和两种作法的斗争。开始，有些专家教授只想办大的新的综合的工厂，不愿搞小的、旧的和专业结合的工厂。他们认为要生产好的产品，必须有好的设备。因此，他们一说要办工厂就伸手向国家要钱、要人、要设备。经过辩论后，大家明确了必须要按照因陋就简、勤俭办厂的方针，贯彻大中小并举和土洋并举的精神。这样很快地掀起了办厂热潮。
