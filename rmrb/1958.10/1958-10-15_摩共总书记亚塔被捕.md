Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 13th - The Moroccan government's official spokesperson announced on the 13th that the Secretary-General of the Moroccan Communist Party, Ali Yata, was arrested in Tangier on the 11th by police authorities for "violating existing immigration regulations" and is being interrogated. Ali Yata was illegally expelled from Morocco by the French colonial authorities in 1948. After Morocco's independence, the Moroccan government still did not allow him to return. Yata was arrested this time after returning to Tangier.

Prior to Yata's arrest, thirteen Moroccan Communist Party leaders in Casablanca were also arrested on charges of "engaging in subversive activities." These individuals are still being detained by the police.
