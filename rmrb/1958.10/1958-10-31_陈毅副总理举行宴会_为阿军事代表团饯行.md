Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Vice Premier Chen Yi held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to the Albanian military delegation headed by General Baluku, which is about to return home after visiting China.

At the banquet, Marshal Chen Yi said, "Today, with feelings of reluctance, we bid farewell to the Albanian military delegation headed by General Baluku. We firmly believe that your visit will greatly strengthen the fighting friendship between our two peoples and our two armed forces."

Marshal Chen Yi said, "Our two peoples stand proudly on the front lines of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, waging a resolute struggle against imperialism and its accomplice revisionists. Your heroic struggle has powerfully supported the Chinese people's struggle to build socialism and oppose American imperialist aggression. Although our two countries are separated by thousands of miles, the mutual support in our common struggle has enabled our two peoples to achieve a high degree of mutual understanding and brotherly unity. We will spare no effort to continue to consolidate and develop this fighting friendship. We firmly believe that our joint struggle will thoroughly shatter all the conspiracies of American imperialism and its accomplices to launch wars of aggression and disintegrate the unity of the socialist camp, maintain world peace, further consolidate and unite the socialist camp, and let the brilliance of Marxism-Leninism shine all over the world."

General Baluku said in his speech, "The imperialists trapped in the mire will sink deeper and deeper. The people of the world have awakened, and the oppressed and colonial peoples have risen up to fight for freedom and independence. American imperialism still occupies China's territory of Taiwan, carrying out military provocations against the People's Republic of China and plotting to create 'two Chinas'. However, the issue is very clear: the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and American imperialism has no right to interfere. They should immediately get out of China's land. We firmly believe that the Chinese people will achieve a complete victory in their just struggle against American imperialist aggression."

General Baluku finally said, "We are about to leave your great and beautiful country. On behalf of the Albanian Labor Party, the government, and the people, I express my gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people for their help to us."

Present at the banquet were General Huang Kecheng, General Xiao Hua, General Zhang Zongxun, General Li Jukui, General Chen Xilian, General Guo Tianmin, Admiral Wang Hongkun, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang of the Air Force, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan.

    陈毅副总理举行宴会
    为阿军事代表团饯行
    新华社30日讯　国务院副总理陈毅元帅今晚举行宴会，为即将回国的以巴卢库上将为首的阿尔巴尼亚访华军事代表团饯行。
    陈毅元帅在会上说，今天我们怀着惜别的心情来欢送以巴卢库上将为首的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团。我们深信，你们的这次访问一定会大大加强我们两国人民和两国武装部队的战斗友谊。
    陈毅元帅说，我们两国人民都以自豪的心情站在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的前哨阵地上，对帝国主义和它的帮凶修正主义者进行着坚决的斗争。你们的英勇斗争，有力地支援了中国人民建设社会主义和反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争。我们两国虽然相隔万里，但是在共同斗争中的相互支持却使我们两国人民达到了高度的相互了解和兄弟般的团结。我们竭尽一切努力，来继续巩固和发展这种战斗之谊。我们坚信，我们共同斗争必将彻底粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶发动侵略战争和瓦解社会主义阵营团结的一切阴谋诡计，使世界和平得到维护，社会主义阵营更加巩固和团结，马列主义的光辉普照全世界。
    巴卢库上将讲话说，陷在泥坑里的帝国主义者将一天比一天陷得更深，世界人民已经觉醒了，被压迫的和殖民地的人民都纷纷起来为争取自由和独立而进行斗争。美帝国主义现在仍然霸占着中国的领土台湾，进行反对中华人民共和国的军事挑衅，并且阴谋制造“两个中国”。但是，问题很清楚，台湾问题是属于中国的内政，美帝国主义无权干涉，它们应该立即从中国的土地上滚出去。我们深信，中国人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争中，必将取得彻底的胜利。
    巴卢库上将最后说，我们就要离开你们伟大而美丽的国家了。我代表阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府以及人民，对兄弟般的中国人民对我们的帮助表示谢意。
    出席宴会作陪的有黄克诚大将、萧华上将、张宗逊上将、李聚奎上将、陈锡联上将、郭天民上将、王宏坤海军上将、刘志坚中将、萧向荣中将、王秉璋空军中将和外交部副部长曾涌泉等。（附图片）
