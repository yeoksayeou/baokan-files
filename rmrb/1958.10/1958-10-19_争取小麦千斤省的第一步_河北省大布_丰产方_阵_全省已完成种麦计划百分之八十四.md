Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th – Hebei Province farmers, determined to achieve a per-mu wheat yield of 1,000 jin next year, have already sown 30,960,000 mu of wheat, accounting for more than 84.3% of the total wheat planting task.

The sowing quality in various places is very good. 70% of the wheat fields have sufficient water sources and existing water lifting tools; 20% of the wheat fields have water sources, and irrigation can be guaranteed as long as water lifting tools are added. More than 80% of the wheat fields have been applied with base fertilizer, of which more than 50% have applied more than 30,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and the remaining have applied 10,000 to 20,000 jin per mu, and the quality of the fertilizer is also good. 70% of the total area of wheat fields has been deeply ploughed to a depth of one chi or more, and the shallowest is also eight cun to one chi. According to statistics from various places on more than 30,076,000 mu of deeply ploughed wheat fields, more than 11,274,000 mu have level ground, straight ditches, and standardized ridge fields, more than 13,372,000 mu have been fertilized in layers after deep ploughing, and more than 5,710,500 mu have been irrigated after deep ploughing. Close planting has been universally implemented, with a general sowing rate of more than 30 jin per mu, and the highest reaching 50 to 60 jin, an increase of one to three times compared with previous years. The varieties are mostly Bima No. 1 and local improved wheat varieties.

The Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee determined to create 15 million mu of large-scale high-yield wheat fields, including 10 million mu with a yield of 3,000 jin per mu, 4 million mu with a yield of 5,000 jin per mu, and 1 million mu with a yield of 10,000 jin per mu. In order to realize the fighting slogan of "making wheat grow according to people's will and making output realize according to people's plans," the Provincial Party Committee requires that Party Committee secretaries at all levels take the lead and, from now on, determine plots, determine measures, determine yields, and be responsible to the end, until the wheat is ripe. At present, various places are implementing this requirement. According to statistics from the six counties of Gaocheng, Zhengding, Jin County, Wuyi, Zhao County, and Hengshui, they have divided more than 766,800 mu of wheat fields into wheat "high-yield squares" with units of about 10,000 mu. Each high-yield square is led by a county party committee member, who is responsible for contracting with commune cadres and technicians. Wuyi County has several professional companies in each high-yield square, about 500 people, who will be responsible for everything from plowing, fertilizing, sowing, seedling management, to wheat ripening.

This year's wheat planting work in Hebei Province is being carried out after the realization of people's communes throughout the province. The people's commune fully demonstrates its superiority. During the wheat planting season, when steel production was in full swing, about one-third of the labor force in various places rushed to the steel production front; the bumper harvest of crops required a large amount of labor; the wheat planting task increased by more than 8 million mu compared with last year, and the requirements for wheat planting quality were unprecedentedly improved. Communes in various places, based on the physical strength and technical conditions of the commune members, formed various specialized teams for deep ploughing, wheat planting, autumn harvesting, fertilizer accumulation and transportation, and water conservancy development in a militarized organization, trained plowmen, and organized red and expert teams. On the boundless land, "battle sheds" stood in rows, red flags were everywhere, and tens of millions of "steel companies" and "women heroes companies" were plowing and planting wheat day and night. Various places also tapped a large number of non-agricultural labor forces (excluding steel workers) from various aspects and invested them in the ploughing and wheat planting campaign, striving to become a thousand-jin wheat province by completing the wheat planting task in a timely manner.

### 争取小麦千斤省的第一步  河北省大布“丰产方”阵  全省已完成种麦计划百分之八十四

    争取小麦千斤省的第一步
    河北省大布“丰产方”阵
    全省已完成种麦计划百分之八十四
    新华社天津18日电　决心在明年实现小麦亩产千斤的河北省农民，已经在三千零九十六万亩麦田下种，占种麦总任务的84.3％强。
    各地播种质量很好。70％的麦地有充分的水源，有现成的提水工具；20％的麦地有水源，只要添设提水工具，就能保证灌溉。麦田施底肥面积在80％以上，其中亩施肥三万斤以上的占50％以上，其余亩施肥也达一万至二万斤，肥的质量也好。土地深翻一尺以上的占麦田总面积的70％，最浅的也达八寸至一尺。据各地对三千零七万六千多亩深翻麦地的统计，地平、沟直、畦田规格化的有一千一百二十七万四千多亩，深翻后施层肥的有一千三百三十七万二千多亩，深翻后浇水的有五百七十一万零五百多亩。普遍实行密植，一般每亩播种三十斤以上，最多的达到五十斤到六十斤，比往年下种量提高一倍到三倍。品种大部分是碧蚂一号和当地的良种小麦。
    中共河北省委第六次（扩大）全会曾确定要搞大面积丰产麦田一千五百万亩，其中亩产三千斤的一千万亩，亩产五千斤的四百万亩，亩产万斤的一百万亩。为了实现“叫小麦按人的意志生长，叫产量按人的计划实现”这个战斗口号，省委要求各级党委书记挂帅，从现在起就要定地块、定措施、定产量，负责到底，直到麦熟。目前，各地正在按照这个要求执行。据藁城、正定、晋县、武邑、赵县、衡水六县统计，他们已把七十六万六千八百多亩麦地，划为以万亩左右为单位的小麦“丰产方”。每个丰产方由一个县委委员挂帅，与公社干部、技术人员负责包干。武邑县在每个丰产方里设有几个专业连队，约五百人左右，他们从翻地、施肥、播种、苗期管理，直到麦熟，将负责到底。
    河北省今年种麦工作，是在全省实现人民公社化后进行的。人民公社充分显示了它的优越性。种麦时正是大搞钢铁的时候，各地约三分之一左右的劳动力奔上了钢铁生产战线；庄稼的大丰收需要大量的劳动力；种麦任务比去年增加了八百多万亩，种麦质量的要求空前提高。各地公社都根据社员体力强弱和技术条件，以军事化的组织编成深翻土地、种麦、秋收、积肥送粪、开展水利的各种专业队，训练扶耧手，组织红专队伍。在无边的大地上，“战棚”林立，红旗遍野，数以千万计的“钢铁连”、“女英雄连”，日夜都在翻地种麦。各地并从各个方面挖掘出大量的非农业劳动力（钢铁工人除外），投入到翻地、种麦运动，为适时完成种麦任务力争成为小麦千斤省而斗争。
