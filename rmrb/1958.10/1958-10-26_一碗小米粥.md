    A Bowl of Millet Porridge
    Zhang Xingyuan
    I returned with the medicine, and it was already pitch black.
    The landlady, old Mrs. Li Chun-chun, was holding a bowl of whitish paste, just about to help Comrade Xiao Changzhu sit up to eat. I took off my shoes and went onto the heated brick bed, only then seeing clearly that it was a bowl of fragrant millet porridge.
    After the old lady left, I said to Comrade Xiao Changzhu, "The last time we gave Grandma a dozen or so catties of grain, she mixed more than half of it with wild vegetables and kudzu root powder to make into a paste to eat. Where did she get this bowl of millet porridge?"
    Upon hearing what I said, Comrade Xiao Changzhu lost his appetite and wanted me to give the porridge to the little brother.
      "Dong Sheng!" I shouted as I walked towards the old lady's house. The old lady's family was having dinner. The old lady and her daughter, seeing me come, quickly hid their rice bowls under the table. Only the little brother's rice bowl was still on the table, filled entirely with kudzu root powder and dry wild vegetables made into a paste. I was stunned. I immediately remembered what happened before getting the medicine.
    In the afternoon, the old lady came to see Comrade Xiao Changzhu and learned that he hadn't eaten for a day. The old lady was very anxious and searched for a long time in the house before taking out a small jar to give to her daughter. Her daughter then poured the grains from the small jar into a wooden mortar and began to pound them. The little brother also lay on the heated brick bed, blowing on the fire in the brazier with his mouth. Thinking of this, I immediately understood: Mother has no more grain, only leaving some seeds, and now, in order to take care of our sick comrade, she even took out the seeds that she couldn't bear to eat herself.
    I looked at Mother, unable to speak for a long, long time.

    一碗小米粥
    张星远
    我拿回药来，天已漆黑了。
    房东李春淳老大娘端着一碗白糊糊的东西，正要肖昌珠同志坐起来吃。我脱掉鞋子到炕上去，才看清楚是一碗香喷喷的小米粥。
    老大娘走后，我对肖昌珠同志说：“上回我们送给大娘的十几斤粮食，她都掺上一多半野菜和葛根粉弄成糊糊吃。她哪儿来的这碗小米粥呢？”
    肖昌珠同志听我一说，就吃不下去了，要我把稀粥端给小弟弟吃。
      “董生！”我一边喊着一边向老大娘的房子走去。老大娘一家人正在吃晚饭。大娘和她的女儿见我走来，连忙把饭碗藏在桌子底下去了。只有小弟弟的饭碗还放在桌上，碗里全是葛根粉和干野菜做成的糊糊饭。这下我呆住了。我立即就想起了拿药以前的事来。
    下午，老大娘来看肖昌珠同志，知道他已经有一天没有吃饭了。大娘很着急，在房子里找了很久才拿出一只小罐给她的女儿。她的女儿就把小罐里的谷粒倒在木臼里舂起来。小弟弟也趴在炕上用嘴在火盆上吹火。想到这里我立刻明白了：阿妈妮没有粮食啦，只留下一些种籽，现在为了照顾我们生病的同志，连自己舍不得吃的种籽也拿出来了。
    我看着阿妈妮，很久很久没说出话来。
