New Forms of Film Art
	Hu Fen

The "new art films" "Steel Men and Iron Horses" and "Huang Baomei," produced by the Shanghai Film Studio, have been released.

The emergence of "new art films" is a victory for the implementation of the Party's socialist line on literature and art in the film industry, and a victory for the implementation of the policy of serving politics, production, and workers, peasants, and soldiers. We applaud and cheer for its birth, and vigorously promote it. However, some people in the film industry believe that these "new art films" have no artistic value and cannot be placed in the "halls of high art." This reflects a fundamental difference: In artistic works, does form determine content, or does content determine form? Should the old dramatic rules bind the expression of new content, or should new dramatic rules be developed and created based on the logic of new life content?

To some people, form and rules are sacred and inviolable, unchanging for eternity. In fact, artistic works are content-determined, and form serves content and exists for content. Times have changed, the content to be expressed in artistic works has changed, and the form must naturally change as well. In today's era of building socialism at the highest speed, literature and art must express the current heroic figures and their communist style correctly, vividly, and clearly at the fastest speed, in order to educate the people and promote the great leap forward of the times. The "new art film" form has emerged in response to this, what is so "strange" about it? Those who attempt to negate "new art films" with old forms and old rules are simply attempting to prevent literature and art from serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Of course, affirming "new art films" and promoting "new art films" does not mean negating or belittling feature films, or opposing the generalization and shaping of artistic images. On the contrary, feature films need to be developed and improved with new content. In the process of producing "new art films," film creators go deep into life, participate in labor, transform and improve their thinking, and accumulate rich life experience, which makes it possible to generalize and shape artistic images on a larger scale, and create excellent feature films that meet the needs of the times.

The times are constantly leaping forward, and new and newer heroic figures and heroic deeds with a higher communist style will inevitably increase, and artistic works must reflect them more quickly; moreover, with the deepening of the cultural revolution, workers, peasants, and soldiers appearing on the screen and writing scripts will become a common phenomenon. By then, "new art films" will inevitably become more developed and mature. Let us once again cheer for "new art films" and wish it a victorious growth, shining brightly on the screen.

    电影艺术的新形式
    胡汾
    上海电影制片公司摄制的“钢人铁马”、“黄宝妹”等“新艺术片”已经上映了。
    “新艺术片”的出现，是电影界贯彻党的社会主义文艺路线的一个胜利，是贯彻电影为政治、为生产、为工农兵服务的方针的一个胜利。我们为它的诞生而欢呼鼓掌，大力提倡。但是电影界中有一些人，以为这些“新艺术片”没有艺术价值，登不上艺术的“大雅之堂”。在这里就反映了一个根本的分歧，即：在艺术作品中，是形式决定内容呢，还是内容决定形式？是让旧的戏剧法则束缚住新内容的表现呢，还是根据新的生活内容的逻辑，发展和创造新的戏剧法则？
    有一些人看来，形式也好，法则也好，是神圣不可侵犯的，永世不变的。其实，艺术作品是内容决定形式，形式为内容服务，为内容而存在。时代变了，艺术作品所要表达的内容变了，形式自然也要起变化。在今天这样一个以最高的速度建设社会主义的时代，文学艺术就要以最快的速度，正确、生动、鲜明地表现出当前的英雄人物和他们的共产主义风格，以此教育人民，推动时代跃进。“新艺术片”这样的新形式便应运而生，这有什么可“怪”呢？那些企图用旧形式、旧法则来否定“新艺术片”的人，无非是企图文艺不要为工农兵服务而已。
    当然，肯定“新艺术片”，提倡“新艺术片”，决不是否定或轻视故事片，反对艺术形象的概括和塑造。相反，故事片还需要以崭新的内容加以发展和提高。在摄制“新艺术片”的过程中，电影创作人员深入生活，参加劳动，改造和提高思想，积累丰富的生活经验，就有可能在较大范围内作艺术形象的概括和塑造，创作优秀的适合时代需要的故事片。
    时代在不断跃进，新的、更新的具有更高的共产主义风格的英雄人物和英雄事迹，必然将越来越多，艺术作品也必然要更加迅速地加以反映；而且随着文化革命的深入，工农群众上银幕、编剧本也将成为普遍的现象。到那时，“新艺术片”必将更加发展和成熟。让我们再一次为“新艺术片”欢呼，祝它胜利成长，在银幕上大放光彩。
