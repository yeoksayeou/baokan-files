Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 1st. Czechoslovak Premier Siroky said on October 1st at the reception held by Cao Ying, the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, in celebration of the 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, that the Czechoslovak people stand firmly with the Chinese people who are fighting to safeguard their sacred rights.

In his speech, Siroky refuted the conspiracy of the so-called "ceasefire" proposal by the United States. He pointed out that the tension in the Taiwan Strait area is entirely caused by the armed provocation of the United States against China and its support for the sinful Chiang Kai-shek clique. He emphasized that only when the United States withdraws all its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait area can the tension in this area be eliminated.

Ambassador Cao Ying expressed, on behalf of the Chinese government and the 600 million Chinese people, his gratitude to the Czechoslovak government and people for their support of the just struggle of the Chinese people at the reception.

Czechoslovak President and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Novotny, attended the reception. Also present at the reception were national leaders such as Dzuransky, Kopecky, Fierlinger, as well as heads of mass organizations and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Czechoslovakia.

    西罗基在我驻捷大使国庆招待会上说
    美军必须从台湾地区撤退
    新华社布拉格1日电　捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基1日在中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛举行的庆祝中国国庆九周年的招待会上说，捷克斯洛伐克人民坚定地同为维护自己的神圣权利而斗争的中国人民站在一起。
    西罗基在讲话中驳斥了美国的所谓“停火”建议的阴谋。他指出，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势完全是美国对中国的武装挑衅和对罪恶的蒋介石集团的支持所造成的。他强调说，只有美国从台湾海峡地区撤出全部武装力量，这一地区的紧张局势才能消除。
    曹瑛大使在招待会上代表中国政府和六亿中国人民向捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民对中国人民正义斗争的支持表示感谢。
    捷克斯洛伐克总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼出席了招待会。出席招待会的还有杜兰斯基、柯别茨基、费林格等国家领导人，以及群众团体的负责人和各国驻捷克斯洛伐克的外交使节等。
