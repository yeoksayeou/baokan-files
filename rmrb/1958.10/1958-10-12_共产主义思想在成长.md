    Communist Ideas are Growing
    Xinhua News Agency Shanghai Branch Reporter
    When you see someone else in trouble, what do you think? Do you see helping others overcome difficulties as your responsibility, or do you stand by and watch?
    When you see someone else about to surpass you, what do you think? Do you actively help others advance together, or do you hope they don't catch up?
    When you have achievements, what do you think? Do you see the achievement as a victory for the collective, or...?
    Here are a few stories from factories in Shanghai, where outstanding workers answered the questions above.
          Sending the Red Flag
    At a weekend meeting at the No. 2 Branch of the New Shanghai Steel Plant, Jiang Quandai, the foreman of the Youth Team of the No. 1 Rolling Mill, heard that the C Team of the No. 2 Rolling Mill planned to work overtime for four hours on Sunday to make up for the tasks they had fallen behind on in the first half of the month. However, the No. 2 Rolling Mill was scheduled for a major overhaul on Sunday and wanted to borrow the rolling mill from No. 1 Rolling Mill. Jiang Quandai thought, "The machines in the two rolling mills are different, and it would be difficult for the comrades in C Team of No. 2 Rolling Mill to operate them smoothly. It will definitely hinder them from making up for their tasks."
    What to do? Jiang Quandai returned to his team to discuss, and everyone said they were willing to give up their rest and help C Team operate the machines together. The next day, thirteen members of the Youth Team arrived early and calibrated the machines to ensure they started on time. The workers from the Youth Team stepped in to operate the parts that the C Team comrades were not familiar with. Four hours passed, and C Team not only made up for the tasks they had fallen behind on but also exceeded their quota by one ton.
    From then on, the output of C Team rose in a straight line, and by the end of the month, it was almost on par with the Youth Team. Whether the Youth Team could retain the red flag this month was in "crisis." At this critical moment, several workers from C Team fell ill. The Youth Team was clearly in an advantageous position to retain the red flag. When the news spread, the comrades of the Youth Team immediately made a decision: the team would double its efforts to produce, strive to retain the red flag, and at the same time, send seven people to support C Team.
    This was indeed somewhat extraordinary, but the Communist Party members of the Youth Team, Feng Benliang and Zhang Yuanshan, said: "We should help others catch up. Our competition is not just for winning the red flag, but more importantly, for improving and advancing together!"
    As a result, C Team surpassed the Youth Team, and the red flag was sent to C Team. The Youth Team received even greater glory. The workers in the factory said: The Youth Team planted the red flag of communist ideology.
              Four Consecutive Victories
    It was almost time to get off work, and the Cao Guoxiang steelmaking team of the Shanghai Machine Repair General Factory youth furnace had already set two new records in less than eight hours, but Cao Guoxiang said to his team comrades: Let's have "four consecutive victories" and create another new record!
    "There's no time left, how can we create a third record?" a young apprentice asked.
    Cao Guoxiang smiled and said: "If we don't have enough time, we can help the next shift create a new record."
    Soon, the comrades of the Zhang Pengfei team, who were taking over the shift, arrived. Cao Guoxiang explained to everyone in detail his experience in creating new records.
    The Zhang Pengfei team quickly grasped the experience of the previous shift, and the steel melted even faster! As a result, they used 115 minutes to smelt a batch of ordinary carbon steel, shortening the record of the Cao Guoxiang team by another two minutes, creating the latest national record!
    "Four consecutive victories" was achieved, but people said it was "four consecutive victories."
    In the past, the first batch of steel after the shift change always took ten minutes longer because the previous shift did not create favorable conditions for the next shift to make steel quickly, which had become a factor affecting the completion of the plan. Now, the Cao Guoxiang team made various preparations for the next shift to make steel quickly and also passed on their experience, so that the first batch of steel after the shift change could create a new record. Isn't this itself a new record?
          From "Competing Sprouts" to Great Collaboration
    The workers of the telephone machine workshop and the switchboard workshop of the Shanghai Wired Electrical Factory were holding a meeting, and the branch secretary told everyone a story:
    One day, Shen Fushou, a worker in the telephone machine workshop, wanted to convert a hexagonal lathe into an automatic lathe, but he was missing a part that needed to be processed by the planer in the switchboard workshop. He ran to the switchboard workshop, but the cadres all shook their heads, replying that the planer was not available. He paced back and forth anxiously, and the old worker of the switchboard workshop, Weng Renzhao, saw him and asked, "Old Shen, how long does it take to process this part?" Old Shen quickly said, "It won't take more than twenty minutes!" Weng Renzhao stopped his own work on the planer and immediately made it for Shen Fushou. In less than twenty minutes, the part was finished.
    Two young workers were particularly moved by this story. They were Wang Yongming and Chen Afu. They used to be in the same group and collaborated very well. Later, they were transferred to two workshops and became the group leaders of the lathe group. Everyone wanted to improve their group and overwhelm the other, "competing sprouts" with each other.
    With this in mind, disputes arose. Once, Wang Yongming's group in the telephone machine workshop had a batch of spindles that needed to be processed by Chen Afu's group in the switchboard workshop. Chen Afu saw that it was the work of his opponent, so he put it aside, only focusing on the work of his own group. After some time, Wang Yongming came over and saw that the spindles were still lying on the ground, and there was rust on the axles. He questioned Chen Afu, and Chen Afu repeatedly emphasized how busy his group was. It took a long time before the spindles were processed. Whenever Chen Afu's group needed the collaboration of Wang Yongming's group, Wang Yongming would delay as much as possible. Everyone only wanted their own group to advance and overwhelm the other.
    The story of the old worker Weng Renzhao kept the two young workers awake at night. Everyone is doing it for socialism, but what am I doing it for?
    The next day, as soon as he started work, Chen Afu went to Wang Yongming and said, "I heard that you don't have enough lathes. We will immediately transfer our best lathe to you." Wang Yongming was very moved and immediately replied, "I heard that you don't have enough people. We will immediately send people to help you!"
    From then on, Chen Afu and Wang Yongming, the two individuals, the two groups, you help me, I help you, collaborating with each other, advancing by leaps and bounds together.

    共产主义思想在成长
    新华社上海分社记者
    当你看到别人有困难的时候，你心里怎么想？是把帮助别人克服困难当作自己的责任呢，还是站在一边袖手旁观？
    当你看到别人将要超过自己的时候，你心里怎么想？是积极帮助别人共同前进呢，还是希望人家不要赶上？
    当你有了成就的时候，你心里又怎么想？是把成就看作集体的胜利呢，还是……？
    这里是发生在上海工厂中的几个故事，优秀的工人们回答了上面的问题。
          送红旗
    在新沪钢铁厂二分厂一个周末的会议上，轧钢一工场青年班的工长蒋全大，听说二工场丙班打算在星期天加班四个小时，补足上半月脱下的任务。可是二工场星期天要大检修，想借用一工场的轧钢机。蒋全大想：“两个工场的机器不一样，二工场丙班同志操作起来不顺手。一定要妨碍补足任务。”
    怎么办呢？蒋全大回到班里一商量，都说愿意放弃休息，帮丙班一起操作。第二天，青年班一早就来了十三个人，把机器都校正好，保证准时开车。丙班同志不顺手的地方，都由青年班的工人上去操作。四个小时过去了，丙班不但补上了脱下的任务，还超额了一吨。
    丙班的产量从此直线上升，快到月底，已经和青年班不相上下。青年班这个月能否保住红旗，已经发生“危机”了。正在这个紧要关口，丙班几个工人生病了。青年班显然已居于保住红旗的有利地位。消息传出，青年班的同志立即作了决定：本班加倍努力生产，争取保住红旗，同时抽出七个人去支援丙班。
    这真是有些出乎寻常了，可是青年班的党员冯本良、张元山等说：“我们应该帮助别人赶上来，我们竞赛不单单是为了夺红旗，更重要的是为了一起提高，一起前进！”
    结果，丙班超过了青年班，红旗送到了丙班。青年班却得到了更大的光荣，厂里工人们说：青年班插上了共产主义思想的红旗。
              连中四元
    快要下班了，上海机修总厂青年炉的曹国相炼钢小组在不到八小时内已经创造了两个新纪录，可是曹国相对小组的同志们说：我们来个“连中三元”，再创造一个新纪录！
    “时间来不及了，怎么能创造第三个纪录？”一个青年艺徒问。
    曹国相笑着说：“我们来不及，可以帮助下一班创造新纪录。
    不一会，接班的张鹏飞小组的同志们来了。曹国相就把自己创造新纪录的经验一五一十地讲给大家听。
    张鹏飞小组迅速掌握了上一班的经验，钢熔化得更快了！结果，他们用一百一十五分钟炼出一炉普炭钢，比曹国相小组的纪录又缩短了两分钟，创造出全国最新的纪录！
      “连中三元”实现了，但是人们说，这是“连中四元”。
    往常，交接班后的第一炉钢，总要延长十多分钟，因为上一班不替下一班创造快速炼钢的有利条件，这已经成为影响完成计划的一个因素。现在曹国相小组替下一班作好各种快速炼钢的准备，还传授经验，使接班后第一炉钢就创造新纪录。这件事的本身，不也是新的纪录吗？
          从“比苗头”到大协作
    上海有线电厂的电话机车间和交换机车间的工人正在开会，支部书记对大家讲了一个故事：
    有一天，电话机车间工人沈福寿想把六角车床改成自动车床，就少一个零件，需要交换机车间的刨床加一下工。他跑到交换机车间，干部都摇摇头，回答说刨床没有空。他踱来踱去发急，给交换机车间的老工人翁仁照看到了，就问：“老沈，这个零件加一下工，要多少时间？”老沈忙说，“要不了二十分钟！”翁仁照就把刨床上自己的活儿停下来，马上替沈福寿做。不到二十分钟，零件就做好了。
    听了这个故事，有两个青年工人特别感动。他们是王永明和陈阿福。他俩原先在一个小组，合作得很好，后来调在两个车间，都当了车床组的小组长，大家都想把小组搞好，压倒对方，彼此“比比苗头”。
    存了这个心，纠纷就来了。有一次电话机车间王永明小组有一批主轴需要交换机车间的陈阿福小组加工，陈阿福一看正是对手的活，就放在一边，只顾做本组的东西。过些时间，王永明走来一看，主轴仍旧躺在地上，轴上还生了锈，就质问陈阿福，陈阿福一再强调自己小组如何如何忙，以后又拖了很久，才把主轴加工好。逢到陈阿福小组需要王永明小组协作时，王永明也能拖就拖。大家只想自己先进，压倒对方。
    老工人翁仁照的故事使两位青年工人都睡不着觉。大家是为了社会主义，我又是为了什么呢？
    第二天一上班，陈阿福就去找王永明讲：“听说你们车床不够用，我们马上调一部最好的车床给你们”。王永明听了，十分感动，马上回答说：“听说你们人不够，我们马上调人来！”
    从此以后，陈阿福和王永明两个人，两个小组，你帮我，我帮你，彼此协作，一起飞跃前进。
