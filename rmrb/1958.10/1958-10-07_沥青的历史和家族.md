    The History and Family of Asphalt
    Ai Xia
    In ancient times, when humans learned to build houses, boats, and make daily utensils from clay, they accidentally discovered a semi-fluid liquid with a black luster exposed on the ground—natural asphalt. Archaeologists have unearthed some ancient daily necessities from the Euphrates River basin dating back two to three thousand years BC, and their broken parts were bonded with asphalt. In the giant architectural relics of Egypt, a famous cultural country, asphalt can also be seen as a bonding material. It can be seen that humans learned the technology of using asphalt very early.

    Seven hundred years before Christ, the Babylonians built a one-kilometer-long tunnel under the Euphrates River and coated the walls of the tunnel with asphalt as a waterproof isolation layer. A century later, the world's first asphalt road was born in the city of Babylon. However, the period of large-scale use of asphalt was still 300 years ago, because that was when large asphalt lakes with abundant output were discovered. On Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Union, there is the Okhinsky asphalt lake with an area of ​​three hectares, with an impurity content of only less than 1%, and the quality is very good. The discovery of Karamay, a famous oil area in our country, will enable us to obtain a large amount of excellent petroleum asphalt.

    People have long known to add mineral powder to asphalt to enhance its bonding ability. This huge bonding force makes asphalt a valuable building material. It can be used as a coating for warehouses and floors, and can also be applied to cables and poles to prevent moisture erosion. It can also be used to pave high-grade roads, giving the road surface the advantages of being flat, smooth, wear-resistant, noiseless when driving, and dust-free.

    Asphalt is a complex compound. Its main component is hydrocarbon, accounting for more than 80%-90%. Other substances such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur only account for less than 15%. When it is heated (or burned), it emits a strong irritating gas, which is harmful to people, and attention should be paid to prevent poisoning.

    In the asphalt family, there are mainly two direct lines: natural asphalt and petroleum asphalt. From the appearance, it is difficult to distinguish them, but they can be quickly distinguished in chemical agents such as carbon disulfide and kerosene. Because asphalt can be dissolved in these reagents. If natural asphalt and petroleum asphalt are placed separately in two containers filled with kerosene and gently stirred with a glass rod, it will be found that the petroleum asphalt quickly dissolves into extremely fine particles and shows a deep red diffusion. The dissolution rate of natural asphalt is slower, and after dissolution, a small amount of ash-like residue accumulates at the bottom of the container, and a black-red diffusion is also present.

    Natural asphalt and petroleum asphalt are born differently. Natural asphalt is "viviparous", while petroleum asphalt requires the process of refining petroleum—"incubation"—to be born.

    If divided in detail, there are two types of natural asphalt. One is asphaltite, which lives in the gaps and cracks of rocks, or seeps into multi-porous rocks to become a separate layer. Once it encounters changes in nature—such as earthquakes, it shows its head, and this is the natural asphalt lake. The other is shale asphalt, which is combined with soft dolomite and limestone crystalline grains; strong force is required to separate them.

    At present, due to the rapid development of the petroleum industry and the "difficult labor" of natural asphalt, natural asphalt is gradually becoming secondary. In the era of highly developed modern science, people only need to add some auxiliary equipment during the manufacturing of petroleum to obtain high-quality petroleum asphalt. Therefore, petroleum asphalt is widely used in construction.

    沥青的历史和家族
    艾侠
    远古时代，当人类学会造房、造船和用粘土制造日用器皿的时候，偶然发现了地面露出带黑色光泽的半流动液体——天然沥青。考古学者们在幼发拉底河流域发掘出一些纪元前二、三千年的古老日用品，它们的破碎部份是用沥青粘结的。在著名的文化古国埃及的巨型建筑遗迹上，也可以看到沥青是被做为粘结材料的。可见，人类在很早以前，就初步学会了使用沥青的技术。
    纪元前七百年，巴比仑人在幼发拉底河下打通了一公里长的隧洞，用沥青涂在隧洞的四壁，做为防水隔离层。又过了一世纪，在巴比仑城市里诞生了世界上第一条沥青路。但是大量使用沥青的时期，还是在三百年以前，因为那时候发现了产量丰富的大型沥青湖。在苏联库页岛上，有一个面积达三公顷的奥兴斯基沥青湖，杂质含量仅在1％以下，质量很好。而我国著名油区克拉玛依的发现，将能得到大量的优良的石油沥青。
    人们很早就知道在沥青里加入矿质粉末来增强粘结能力。这种巨大的粘结力使沥青成为一种宝贵的建筑材料。它可以做为仓库、地板的涂层，也可以涂在电缆、电杆上，防止水分的侵蚀。它还可以铺筑高级的路面，使路面具有平整、光滑、耐磨、行车时无燥音、不扬尘土的优点。
    沥青是复杂的化合物。它的主要成份是炭氢化合物，占80％—90％以上。其它如氧、氮、硫等物质仅占15％以下。当它在加温（或燃烧）时，便发出强烈的刺激性气体，这种气体对人是有害的，要注意防止中毒。
    在沥青的大家庭里，主要分为天然沥青和石油沥青两个嫡系。从外貌看，很难把它们区别开，但在二硫化碳、煤油等化学调剂里，就能很快地区别它们。因为沥青可以溶化在这些试剂中。如果把天然沥青和石油沥青分别放在两个盛着煤油的容器里，用玻璃棒轻轻搅动，就会发现石油沥青在迅速溶化成极细微的颗粒，并呈现出深红色的扩散。而天然沥青的溶化速度较慢，溶化后，容器底部积存起一小撮灰烬状的残渣，还呈现出黑红色的扩散。
    天然沥青和石油沥青的出生方式是不同的。天然沥青是“胎生”的，而石油沥青要有提炼石油——“孵化”的过程，才能降生。
    如果细分，天然沥青有两种。一种是地沥青，它住在岩石的空隙、裂缝中，或渗入多缝隙的岩石里成为单独的一层。一旦遇到自然界的变迁——如地震，便露出头来，这就是天然沥青湖。另一种是页岩沥青，它和松软的白云石、石灰石的结晶粒结合在一起；要用强力才能使它们分开。
    目前，由于石油工业的飞速发展和天然沥青的“难产”，天然沥青逐渐退居次要地位。在现代科学高度发达的时代，人们只要在制造石油的过程中，增添一些辅助设备，就可以得到优质的石油沥青。因此，在建设中广泛利用着石油沥青。
