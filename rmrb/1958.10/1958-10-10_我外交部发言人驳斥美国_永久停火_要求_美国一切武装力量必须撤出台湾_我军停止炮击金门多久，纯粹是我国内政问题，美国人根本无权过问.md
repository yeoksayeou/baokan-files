Xinhua News Agency, 9th. In the past two days, US Secretary of State Dulles, Under Secretary of State Herter, and State Department spokesman White, among others, have successively issued statements regarding our army's suspension of shelling of Jinmen. In response, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement:

	Our army's humanitarian action of suspending the shelling of Jinmen has been warmly welcomed by the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, as well as by public opinion around the world. However, US Secretary of State Dulles and Under Secretary of State Herter and others have shown great panic, insisting on confusing this measure taken by our army with the US's ceasefire conspiracy. They also put forward demands for a so-called permanent ceasefire and threatened to resume so-called escorting. This further exposes the imperialist face of the United States, which insists on interfering in China's internal affairs and deliberately creating tensions.

	Whether our army stops or does not stop shelling Jinmen, whether the stoppage is short or long, is purely a matter of our internal affairs, and the Americans have no right to interfere at all. The Americans cannot deny that China is not at war with the United States, so there is no question of a ceasefire. As for the issue between the Chinese government and the Taiwan local authorities, the Americans have no right to speak for the Taiwan authorities. This is not only because the Taiwan authorities have not appointed the Americans as representatives, but even if they did, we would never recognize it. No Chinese with national self-esteem would want foreigners to act as representatives to resolve their own domestic problems. In short, the Chinese people are fully capable of resolving their own affairs, and will not allow the United States to interfere in any way. The US ceasefire conspiracy cannot deceive anyone.

	The so-called US escorting, under any circumstances, is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, the issue is not, as the US State Department says, that "there is temporarily no need for escorting," but that the United States has no right to conduct escorting at all. The United States' attempt to threaten the Chinese people into accepting their ceasefire conspiracy by resuming escorting is a complete miscalculation.

	The reason the United States wants to get entangled with a ceasefire is that it attempts to use the ceasefire as a pretext to permanently occupy Taiwan and Penghu, and further interfere in Jinmen and Mazu, to realize its conspiracy to create "two Chinas." China's internal affairs brook no interference, and the United States not only has no right to interfere in Jinmen and Mazu, but also has absolutely no right to interfere in Taiwan and Penghu. There is only one China, and the US conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is not even dared to be echoed by the Taiwan authorities. No patriotic Chinese will allow the United States to separate Taiwan from China's territory.

	The issue is becoming increasingly clear that the tension in the Taiwan Strait is entirely created by the United States. From June 27, 1950, the United States has occupied Taiwan by force. In order to expand its scope of aggression against China from Taiwan and Penghu to Jinmen and Mazu, in the past month or so, the United States has concentrated an unprecedentedly huge armed force in the Taiwan Strait, constantly conducting military provocations and war threats against China, and has violated China's territorial waters and airspace more than twenty times in a row, which has not stopped even now. Just in the past two days, the United States has also sent Nike-Hercules missile units to Taiwan, and threatened to resume so-called escorting.

	It is best for the one who tied the bell to untie it. The key to eliminating tensions in the Taiwan Strait is for the United States to withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and Taiwan Strait. The Americans should return to where they came from. Now is no longer the time when imperialism can run rampant. Haven't the Americans themselves agreed to withdraw their troops from Lebanon? How can they always stay in Taiwan without leaving?

	If the Americans want to prove to the world that they have no intention of interfering in China's internal affairs and are not prepared to threaten China with war, then they should completely stop the so-called escort activities, stop violating the territorial waters and airspace of mainland China, and stop concentrating troops in the Taiwan Strait; their ambassador should sit down properly in Warsaw and negotiate with our representatives on the specific methods and steps for withdrawing all US armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and should not talk about any ceasefire. Otherwise, they will be subjected to even stronger condemnation from the people of the world and put themselves in a more passive position.

    我外交部发言人驳斥美国“永久停火”要求
    美国一切武装力量必须撤出台湾
    我军停止炮击金门多久，纯粹是我国内政问题，美国人根本无权过问
    新华社9日讯　近两天来，美国国务卿杜勒斯、副国务卿赫脱和国务院发言人怀特等，相继就我军暂停炮击金门一事发表声明。对此，我外交部发言人发表谈话如下：
    我军暂停炮击金门的人道主义行动，得到了台、澎、金、马军民和全世界舆论的热烈欢迎。但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯和副国务卿赫脱等人却表现了很大的慌乱，硬要把我军所采取的这一措施，同美国的停火阴谋混为一谈。他们还提出什么永久停火的要求，并且以恢复所谓护航相要挟。这就进一步暴露了美国坚持干涉中国内政、蓄意制造紧张局势的帝国主义面目。
    我军对金门的炮击停止还是不停止，停止得短还是停止得长，这纯粹是我国的内政问题，美国人根本无权过问。美国人也不能不承认，中国同美国没有打仗，当然谈不上停火。至于中国政府同台湾地方当局之间的问题，美国人无权代表台湾当局说话。这不仅因为台湾当局没有委派美国人做代表，而且即使委派了，我们也决不会承认。凡有民族自尊心的中国人，决不会要外国人当代表来解决自己国内的问题。总之，中国人的事，中国人完全会自己解决，无论如何也不容美国干涉。美国的停火阴谋是骗不了人的。
    美国的所谓护航，不管是在什么情况下，都是对于中国内政的一种明目张胆的干涉。因此，问题不是美国国务院所说的“暂时没有必要进行护航”，而是美国根本无权进行护航。美国企图用恢复护航来威胁中国人民接受他们的停火阴谋，那完全是打错了算盘。
    美国所以要用停火来纠缠，它的企图就是以停火为名，永远霸占台、澎，进一步插手金、马，实现它制造“两个中国”的阴谋。中国内政不容干涉，美国不仅无权过问金、马，就是台湾、澎湖，美国也完全无权过问。中国只有一个，美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，连台湾当局也不敢附和。没有一个爱国的中国人会容许美国把台湾从中国的版图分割出去。
    问题越来越清楚，台湾海峡的紧张局势完全是美国一手造成的。从1950年6月27日起，美国就以武力霸占了台湾。为了把它侵略中国的范围，从台、澎扩大到金、马，这一个多月，美国在台湾海峡集中了空前巨大的武装力量，不断对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，接连二十多次侵犯中国的领海和领空，直到现在还未停止。就在这两天，美国还派遣了奈克—赫尔克里斯导弹部队进驻台湾，并且以恢复所谓护航相要挟。
    解铃最好是系铃人。消除台湾海峡紧张局势的关键，是美国从台湾和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。美国人从那里来，就应当回到那里去。现在已经不是帝国主义可以横行霸道的时候了。美国人自己不是也不得不同意从黎巴嫩撤退它的军队吗？他们怎么能够老是赖在台湾不走呢？
    如果美国人要想向世界证明，他们无意干涉中国内政，也不准备对中国进行战争威胁，那么，他们就应该完全停止所谓护航活动，停止侵犯中国大陆的领海和领空，停止在台湾海峡集结兵力；他们的大使就应该好好地在华沙坐下来谈判，同我国代表商谈关于从台湾和台湾海峡撤走一切美国武装力量的具体办法和步骤，而不要再扯什么停火。否则的话，他们就会受到世界人民更加强烈的谴责，使自己处在更加被动的地位。
