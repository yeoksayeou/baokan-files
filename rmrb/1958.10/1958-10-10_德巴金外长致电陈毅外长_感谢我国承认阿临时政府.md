Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Foreign Minister Chen Yi of the People's Republic of China received a letter from Mohammed Lamine Debaghine, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, in which he expressed his gratitude for the People's Republic of China's decision to recognize the Republic of Algeria. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Your Excellency, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

I have the honor to express to you our deep gratitude for the People's Republic of China's prompt recognition of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, a decision you notified me of in your telegram of September 22, 1958.

This action, of undeniable historical significance, should be recorded in the annals of the Chinese people's continuous efforts to achieve freedom and independence for colonial peoples and to establish world peace.

The Algerian people, who have been engaged in four years of brutal struggle against imperialist reoccupation, are deeply moved by this expression of friendship and understanding from the Chinese people. At the same time, they feel extremely honored to receive the support of the great Chinese people in a severe trial, the Chinese people once again demonstrating their firm determination to unite with the Asian and African peoples against Western imperialism.

I believe that this decision by your government will increase the friendship existing between our two peoples and will open a new era for beneficial cooperation between the two governments on the basis of the Bandung Conference resolutions.

Please convey to His Excellency Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai my gratitude, as well as that of the Algerian people and government.

Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria

Mohammed Lamine Debaghine

Cairo, October 6, 1958
