    Operating Precautions

    After the furnace is dried, first put 60 catties of easily combustible wood and 60 catties of coke at the bottom of the furnace. After igniting, add forced air for 5 to 15 minutes after about an hour, then stop for 20 minutes. When the coke inside the furnace burns evenly, gradually increase the air, then add 30 catties of coke. Add forced air for another 15 minutes, then add 30 catties of coke. After continuous burning for about an hour, add 5 to 8 catties of limestone, 20 catties of pig iron, 30 catties of ore, and 25 catties of coke to start smelting. Thereafter, add ore, coke, and limestone once every eight to ten hours, and tap iron once every twenty-five minutes.
    However, due to differences in ore quality, the proportion of certain materials should be increased or decreased accordingly.
    1.  Charging: Limestone should be free of impurities and the size should be uniform, no larger than 30 mm and no smaller than 10 mm. Coke should be no larger than 70 mm and no smaller than 20 mm.
    2.  Watching the fire: The furnace fire must be even. Check the fire every four to five minutes. If the fire is uneven, adjust it immediately to prevent the furnace from collapsing.
    3.  Watching the tuyere: Check the bottom tuyeres every four to five minutes. A yellowish-white iron color is normal. If the color is black and there is a cooling phenomenon, use a fire needle to clear the tuyere to increase the temperature. If the color is black and there may be nodules forming, add coke and limestone to burn off the nodules before adding ore, otherwise the furnace will collapse.
    4.  The hearth slag plays a role in maintaining the temperature inside the furnace and should not be removed too frequently. It should be allowed to flow out naturally. If the hearth slag is too viscous, add some limestone. If it is too thin, reduce the amount of limestone accordingly. If it solidifies at the bottom, it can be removed completely.

    操作注意事项
    炉子烘干后，首先在炉底部放入易燃木料六十斤，焦炭六十斤，点燃后约一小时再加吹风五至十五分钟，再停二十分钟，待炉内焦炭燃烧均匀时，逐渐加风，再投入焦炭三十斤，再加风十五分钟，以后再加焦炭三十斤，连续烧约一个小时左右，即可添石灰石五至八斤，引铁二十斤，矿石三十斤，焦炭二十五斤，开始冶炼。此后每八至十小时加添矿石、焦炭、石灰石一次，每二十五分钟出铁一次。
    但由于矿石质量不同，也应适当增加或减少某种的比例。
    1、下料：石灰石应选用不含杂质为宜，块的大小要均匀，大不超过三十公厘，小不小于十公厘，焦炭大不过七十公厘，小不小于二十公厘。
    2、看火：炉火必须均匀，每四至五分钟看火一次，如发现火头不匀时，应立即调匀以防座炉。
    3、看风眼：底下风眼四至五分钟看一次，铁色发黄白时为正常，黑色有冷却现象应用火针拨去风口，以提高温度，如发黑色有结瘤可能，必须加添焦炭、石灰石将结瘤烧化再加矿石，否则就会座炉。
    4、膛渣在炉内能起保持温度作用，不应过勤掏出，应该使膛渣自然流出，如果膛渣过粘时应加些石灰石，过稀时相应的减少石灰石，结底时可全部掏出。
