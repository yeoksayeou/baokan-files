Xinhua News Agency, Xining, October 10th: The Qinghai Provincial State-Operated Delingha Farm's experiments with winter sowing of spring wheat over the past few years have proven that winter sowing of spring wheat can not only solve the problem of labor and livestock shortages during the spring sowing season, but also is an important measure to increase the yield of spring wheat.

	Delingha Farm is located on the eastern edge of the Qaidam Basin, with a high altitude and cold climate, and an annual rainfall of only 75 millimeters. The sowing period for spring wheat here is only about one month, and most crops such as highland barley and peas must be sown during this period, so labor, livestock, and farm implements are all strained. However, the time from autumn harvest to the second year's spring sowing is relatively idle. In the winter of 1956, the farm began winter sowing trials of spring wheat on eight-tenths of a mu of land. On October 15th, the seeds were dry-sown in the ground, and water was irrigated on March 25th of the following year. When the surface of the soil turned yellow, harrowing was carried out. As a result, the winter-sown wheat emerged ten days earlier than the spring-sown wheat, and its growth and development were also better than the spring-sown wheat. After ripening, the wheat was harvested and threshed separately. The winter-sown wheat yielded 840 jin per mu, while the spring-sown wheat yielded only 532 jin per mu.

	Last winter, the farm again tested winter sowing on 14 mu of land. The seeds were dry-sown in early November, and spring irrigation and soil loosening were carried out in early April this year. According to the results of a recent preliminary yield assessment, the winter-sown wheat can produce 1,600 jin per mu, while the spring-sown wheat can produce 1,188 jin per mu.

    试验春麦冬播成功
    新华社西宁10日电　青海省地方国营德令哈农场几年来试行春小麦冬播的结果证明：春小麦冬播不仅可以解决春播期间劳力、畜力缺乏问题，并且是增加春小麦产量的一项重要措施。
    德令哈农场在柴达木盆地的东沿，地势高寒，全年降雨量只有七十五公厘。这里的春麦播种期只有一个月左右，而且青稞、豌豆等大部农作物都要在这个期间播种，因此劳力、畜力和农具都感到紧张。但是在秋收后到第二年春播的时间里，却相对地比较空闲。 1956年冬季，农场就在八分地里开始进行春小麦临冬播种试验，10月15日把种籽干播在地里，第二年3月25日灌水，待地皮泛黄时就进行耙耖。结果冬播的麦子比春播的麦子提早十天出苗，生长发育也比春播的好。成熟后单收单打，冬播种的麦子折合亩产八百四十斤，春播的亩产只五百三十二斤。
    去年冬季，农场又在十四亩地上再次试行冬播。11月上旬干播下种，今年4月初进行春灌松土，从最近初步查定产量的结果来看，冬播的每亩可产一千六百斤，春播的每亩可产一千一百八十八斤。
