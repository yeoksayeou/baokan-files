Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, October 1st. To express gratitude for the internationalist spirit of Soviet experts Kutsnyegin and Kavalev, who risked their lives to save people, Premier Zhou Enlai specially awarded certificates of appreciation to these two experts. The People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a grand award ceremony in Urumqi on the 28th. At the meeting, Saifuddin, Chairman of the People's Committee of the Autonomous Region, presented the certificates of appreciation to Kutsnyegin and Kavalev on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai. Leaders from the Party, government, and military of the Autonomous Region, as well as the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Dabashin, attended the meeting.

Soviet experts Kutsnyegin and Kavalev were assisting in their work at a certain unit of the Xinjiang 519 Team of the Second Ministry of Machine Building. On May 27th of this year, they, along with two others, risked their lives near the poplar trees to rescue the translator Wang Ruoyu, who had accidentally fallen into the floodwaters.

Saifuddin and Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Dabashin, both spoke at the award ceremony. Chairman Saifuddin said: Soviet experts Kutsnyegin and Kavalev risked their lives to rescue Wang Ruoyu from the swift floodwaters. This admirable and glorious deed fully demonstrates the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and the internationalist spirit and noble communist character of the Soviet people. Soviet Consul General Dabashin said in his speech that Soviet-Chinese friendship was solidified with blood in the struggle against the common enemies of China and the Soviet Union. We regard the certificates of appreciation awarded to Kutsnyegin and Kavalev by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, as a manifestation of the great friendship of the Chinese people and government towards the Soviet people.
