    The Deep Plowing Corps in Battle
    By our reporters Ji Xichen, Ding Fan, Sun Yuedong

    Entering the territory of Dayi County, Sichuan, one sees a heart-stirring scene: under the fluttering red flags, thousands upon thousands of deep plowing troops, organized according to military formations, line up in battle formation, shouting to the oxen, wielding their hoes, turning the ropes of the rope-traction machines, and transporting mud, fighting in the fields day and night, rain or shine.

    Deep Plowing Warriors on the Attack
    This county, with over 90,000 soldiers persisting on the agricultural front, and with nearly half of its main labor force having gone up the mountains to make steel, has not only quickly implemented rope-traction mechanization throughout the county, but has also changed the "sparrow warfare" of scattered cultivation in the past, adopting methods of mobile warfare and positional warfare, breaking down the boundaries of townships, communes, and teams, and organizing many field corps, camping and settling in the fields, never leaving the battlefield day and night, plowing one piece of land after another, and transferring operations in rotation everywhere.

    In the past few days, from the mountains to the plains, from children in their teens to old people in their sixties and seventies, everyone who can work has been thrown into the battle. They work hard all day, and then continue the night battle. The 7th was the last day of the county's general offensive. Just a little after midnight, the people of the Qunfeng Commune, sleeping in their camp sheds, heard the bugle call and ran out of the men's and women's dormitories, washed their faces by the river, and immediately lined up on the edge of the field. At this time, Zhou Shuzhen, the secretary of the women's branch, looked at the dark and cloudy sky, rolled up the trousers that were wet with dew, and, full of spirit, began her pre-battle speech, waving the red flag in her hand:
      "Yesterday we deep plowed 120 mu, and today we must strive to exceed 150 mu. To see who is the hero, look to see who plants this red flag at the edge of the field the earliest!"
    In a burst of cheers, the shock brigade leader Lu Jiecheng ran out of the crowd, waving his ox whip, and said, "Comrades, follow me, we cannot let the red flag run away from our team!"

    As the company dispersed in the heavy fog, the combat teams, centered on each ox and rope-traction machine, immediately began to work under the light of torches. Although they could not see each other's faces clearly, they worked in an orderly manner according to a strict division of labor. As the ox plowed the ground, several people following behind the furrow immediately moved the overturned soil away, and then moved the rope-traction machine to re-plow on the new soil layer...
    "How deep is the plowing?" Yang Shuzhen, with several inspectors, walked along the furrow, asking as she went.
    "Measure it!" Several team members, moving the creaking traction machine, said, lifting their sweat-soaked clothes.
    Yang Shuzhen bent down and inserted the ruler into the sticky furrow to measure. After a while, she shone the torch on the ruler and said, "That's really good, more than one chi and two cun deep! Comrades, it must be deeper!"

    For Tomorrow
    The overcast sky soon began to rain. The rain gradually increased from light to heavy, soaking everyone's clothes. However, no one left the field. Helpless, squad leader Zhou Yucheng had to persuade the disabled youth Zhou Changgen to leave the "front line" first. This poor peasant Youth League member, whose legs were completely paralyzed, had been following the corps in battle for seven or eight days in order to win a greater increase in the production of wheat and rapeseed and create a happy and beautiful tomorrow. Unable to walk on his legs, he crawled to the field every day with his hands, prostrating himself in the mud, supporting himself with one hand and throwing the overturned clods to the side with the other.
    "The rain is getting heavy, you go back first."
    "No, I will not go back. The more difficult it is, the more the Youth League members are needed." Saying that, he turned around and shouted loudly into the darkness, "Comrades, the sun is about to come out, we must gather our courage and persist to the final victory!"

    When resting, he crawled over the muddy ground, sat on a higher earthen embankment, and, in the wind and rain, sometimes took out his beloved bamboo flute and played melodious songs; sometimes picked up the megaphone and encouraged everyone, singing clapperdoge:
    Forget fatigue with double thousand jin per mu,
    Don't want to sleep working late at night;
    Men and women's enthusiasm rushes to the clouds,
    Scaring the moon to fall to the west.
    The clapperdoge and songs brought infinite strength and courage to the people. Moved by his heroic behavior, the men and women team members immediately launched an attack on the unplowed land. In one night of battle, more than 30 mu of land was deep plowed. From then on, the village circulated a clapperdoge poem praising his model deeds: "Disabled hero Zhou Changgen, crawling and carrying soil moves people, the flute plays so the heart blooms, deep plowing becomes more vigorous the more you do..."

    The Undying Flame
    The boiling night, the selfless labor, the communist spirit of the deep plowing warriors, inspired everyone in the village. In the battle to win a greater leap forward next year, everyone was thinking about this question: What can I do for a bumper harvest?

    In Chaoyang Commune, there was an old man named Zhou, who was over eighty years old. Because he was old and weak, and had difficulty moving, he rarely went out. This day, when he walked outside the door and saw the vast crowds of people outside the village, with the light of the fire reflecting in the sky, he could no longer sit still. He thought: Everyone is working, how can I be idle at home? So, leaning on his crutches, he stumbled to the field. Others persuaded him to go back to rest, but he said:
    "I, the old man, cannot plow the fields or dig the soil, but lighting a fire for you to illuminate is my contribution!"

    So, he held up the torch, standing by the field, illuminating the ground for others. Not until the rooster crowed and the east turned white did he smilingly return home.

    The Unyielding People
    In the morning, the sun rose from the east, and suddenly gongs and drums sounded in the joyful fields. Report teams, congratulation teams, and the club's cultural troupes came to the victorious people everywhere.
    At this time, Yang Xiuying, a female Communist Party member and captain of the middle team, who had finished plowing the last mud ditch, wiped the mud and sweat from her face and shouted loudly to the field inspection team:
    "How much was plowed in the end?"
    "Really amazing! You deep plowed 4.5 mu of land in one day and one night, more than one mu more than the men's team!"
    This new record alarmed the people around. The story is this: After all 225 male laborers in the team went up the mountain to make steel, everyone decided to launch a deep plowing assault overnight. But when it came to the decisive battle, the four remaining male plowing hands in the team wavered in the face of difficulties. They believed that since all the men had gone up the mountain, it was impossible for the women to complete the deep plowing task alone. After dark, they quietly put down their farm tools, went AWOL from the fields, and ran to nearby factories to work as temporary workers. Although this made Yang Xiuying very angry, it did not scare this strong female Communist Party member. She immediately gathered the more than 200 women in the team, explained the task and the difficulties, and before she could finish speaking, the women clamored to say:
    "Let those few escape! We will learn the technique and plow the land ourselves!"

    Under the mobilization of Yang Xiuying, the village organized 31 nurseries and kindergartens, set up 7 collective canteens, and 187 women who were freed from housework immediately threw themselves into the hot deep plowing movement. Yang Xiuying not only plowed the land herself, but also taught others while plowing, teaching seven women to use oxen. In addition to completing the task of 110 mu of land for her own team ahead of schedule, she also helped other teams deep plow more than 30 mu of land.

    Fieldside Cooking Smoke
    When we came to visit the fields, deep trenches like battle trenches were dug everywhere on the deep plowed land, rows of earthen walls like earthen ridges were stacked up, and bunker-shaped soil-smoking kilns were built. Wisps of gray-white smoke filled the turned earth.

    Li Yufen, a young female shock brigade leader wearing a plaid shirt, stood in a trench-like ditch, grabbed a handful of smoked soil, smelled it near her nose, and said excitedly:
      "Listen, how fragrant this mud is! We must strive for 100,000 jin of wheat per mu!"

    Then, this 21-year-old female Communist Party member, who came from a poor peasant family, immediately began to tell us the principle that smoking the soil can quickly mature the raw soil, like a soil scientist. She said that the land they deep plowed was all plowed twice and dug three times, from the past three or four cun to three or four chi deep. In order to combine deep plowing to improve the soil, they first moved all the topsoil to the edge of the field; then, they stacked the dug-up raw soil blocks into soil-smoking kilns one person high. Although the raw soil clay was as hard as stone, it quickly became soft after several days and nights of smoking and sun exposure. At this time, combining the work of returning the crushed soil after the raw soil was matured, they also applied 200,000 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer and manure, layer by layer, to the field. When the final process was completed and the original topsoil was re-spread on the field, the entire turned land seemed to be covered with a soft cotton quilt. The county universally adopted this method of deep plowing combined with soil smoking and fertilization, completing the sowing of wheat and rapeseed on tens of thousands of mu of land half a month ahead of schedule.

    战斗中的深耕兵团
    本报记者　纪希晨、丁凡、孙跃冬
    一走进四川大邑县境，就看到一种惊心动魄的情景：红旗招展下，成千成万的深翻大军，按照军事化的编制，一队队的摆开阵势，吆着牛、挥着昂锄，转动着绳索牵引机，运送着泥巴，不分昼夜风雨地在田野里战斗。
    深耕战士在进攻
    这个县坚持在农业战线上的九万多个战士，在将近一半主要劳动力上山炼钢以后，全县不仅很快实行了绳索牵引机化，并且还改变过去分散耕作的“麻雀战术”，采用运动战、阵地战的方法，打破了乡、社、队的界限，组织起许多野战兵团，在田野安营扎寨，昼夜不离战地，耕完一片又一片，到处轮番转移作战。
    几天来，从山区到平原，从十多岁的小孩到六七十岁的老人，一切能动手劳动的人，全都投入到战斗中来。白天紧张劳动一天，天黑又连续夜战。7日这天，是全县发起全线进攻的最后一天。时间刚到午夜下一点，群风公社熟睡在营棚里的人们，一听见号声，就从男女宿舍中奔跑出来，到河边洗了脸，马上排队集合在田边。这时，女分支部书记周淑珍望了望黑云沉沉的天空，卷起被露水打湿的裤筒，舞起手中的红旗，精神抖擞的开始队前讲话说：
      “昨天我们深耕了一百二十亩，今天要争取超过一百五十亩。谁是英雄好汉，就看那个最早将这面红旗插到田头边！”
    一片欢腾的喧闹声中，突击队
  长陆结成挥着牛鞭，从人群里跑出来说：“同志们，跟我来，不能让红旗从我们队上跑开！”
    当中队在大雾中散开的时候，以每部耕牛和绳索牵引机为中心的战斗小组，立刻在火把照耀下耕作起来。他们虽然谁也看不清谁的脸孔，可是却能按照严密的分工，井然有序的工作着。前头耕牛一犁开地面，跟在犁沟后面的几个人，马上将翻起的泥土搬开，然后再搬动绳索牵引机，在新土层上重翻一遍……。
    “耕的有多深？”杨淑珍带着几个检查员，边走边问，顺着犁沟走来。
    “你量一量吧！”几个队员搬着咯吱咯吱发响的牵引机，掀起汗透的衣服说。
    杨淑珍弯下身子，将尺子插进带粘性的犁沟里，测量起来。过一会，用火把照着尺子说：“真不错呀，一尺二寸多深啦！同志们，还得再深一些！”
    为了明天
    阴云密布的天空，不多会儿就下起雨来。雨渐渐由小变大，湿透了大家的衣衫。可是，没一个人离开田间。没奈何，小队长周玉成只好劝说残废青年周长根先下“火线”。这个两条腿完全瘫痪的贫农共青团员，为争取增产更多的小麦、油菜，创造幸福、美好的明天，七八天来，一直跟随兵团作战。两条腿不能走路，他便每天用两只手爬行到田间，匍匐在泥土里，一只手撑地，一只手把翻起的泥块抡到一边。
    “雨下大了，你先回去。”
    “不，我不回去，越是困难，越需要共青团员。”说着，他扭转身，向着黑暗，大声的喊：“同志们，太阳就要出来啦，我们要鼓起勇气，坚持到最后胜利！”
    休息的时候，他爬过泥地，坐在较高的土坎上，在风雨中，一会掏出心爱的竹笛，吹奏起悦耳动听的歌曲；一会拿起传话筒，向大家进行鼓动喊话，唱快板：
    亩产双千忘了累，
    干到深夜不想睡；
    男女干劲冲云霄，
    吓得月亮往西坠。
    快板和歌曲，给人们带来无限力量和勇气。被他这种英雄行为感动了的男女队员，立刻向没有耕完的土地发起了攻击。一夜战斗，深耕土地三十多亩。从此，村里就流传起：“残废英雄周长根，爬行运土感动人，笛子吹得心花放，深耕越干越起劲……”的快板诗，赞美他的模范事迹。
    不灭的火光
    沸腾的夜晚，忘我的劳动，深耕战士们的共产主义精神，感召着村里的每一个人。在争取明年更大跃进的战斗里，每一个人都在想着这个问题：我能为大丰收做些什么呢？
    朝阳公社有一位八十多岁的周老汉，因年老力衰，行动困难，平时很少出门。这天，当他走到门外，看见村外遍地人山人海，火光映天，他再也坐不下了。他想：人人都在劳动，我那能闲在家里？于是拄着拐杖，跌跌撞撞摸到地里。别人劝他回去休息，他说：
    “我老汉不能犁田、挖土，给你们点火照明，也算尽我一分力量！”
    于是，他就一直举起火把，站在田边，给别人照明耕地。直到雄鸡高叫，东方发白，他才笑眯眯地转回家来。
    不屈的人
    清晨，太阳从东方升起，欢腾的田里，突然锣鼓四起。报喜队、贺功队和俱乐部的文工队，到处向胜利的人们拥来。
    这时，耕完最后一道泥沟的女共产党员、中队长杨秀英，用手擦了擦脸上的泥巴和汗水，大声向田间检查组喊道：
    “到底耕了多少呢？”
    “真了不起！你一天一夜深耕了四亩五分地，比男子队还多耕一亩多！”
    这个新纪录，惊动了周围的人们。事情是这样的：在全队二百二十五个男劳动力上山炼钢以后，大家决定连夜突击深耕土地。可是临到决战的时候，队里剩下的四个男子犁田手，却在困难面前动摇起来，他们认为男子都上了山，光凭妇女根本完不成深耕任务。天黑后，便悄悄放下农具，从田野里开了小差，跑到附近工厂去当临时工去了。这件事，虽使杨秀英十分生气，可是并没有吓倒这位坚强的女共产党员。她立刻把队里的二百多个妇女召集起来，把任务和困难讲了一遍，不等说完，妇女们争先嚷着说：
    “让他们几个逃走吧！我们学习技术，自己耕地！”
    在杨秀英发动下，村里当天组织起三十一个托儿所和幼儿园，办起七个集体食堂，一百八十七个从家务劳动中解放出来的妇女，立刻投入火热的深耕运动。杨秀英不但自己犁地，还边犁边教，教会七个妇女使牛，除提前完成本队一百一十亩地的任务，还帮助别的队深耕了三十多亩地。
    田间炊烟
    我们来到田间参观的时候，深耕的土地上到处挖起战壕似的深沟，叠起一列列土墙似的土埂，修起一座座碉堡形的熏土窑。缕缕灰白色的炊烟，弥漫着翻过的大地。
    穿着花格衬衫的青年女突击队长李玉芬，站在战壕似的深沟里，抓起一把熏烧过的泥土，放在鼻边闻了闻，激动地说：
      “你们闻，这泥巴多香啊！我们要争取一亩地打十万斤小麦哩！”
    接着，这位贫农出身的二十一岁女共产党员，好像一位土壤学家似的，马上向我们讲述起熏土能使生土迅速熟化的道理。她说：他们深耕的土地，全都犁两道，挖三次，由过去的三、四寸达到三、四尺深。为结合深耕改良土壤，他们先把表层的熟土全部搬送到田边上；然后，再把挖起的生土块，砌叠成一人高的熏土窑。生土胶泥虽然坚硬如石，可是经过几天几夜的熏烧日晒，很快就变得松软了。这时，结合生土熟化后的碎土还原工作，又将二十万斤杂肥、粪水，分层施到田里。当完成最后一道工序，把原来的熟土重又铺撒在田野上的时候，整个翻过身的土地，好像盖上了松软的棉被。全县普遍采用这种深耕结合熏土、施肥的方法，提前半月完成十几万亩播种小麦、油菜的土地。
