    Indigenous Steel and Foreign Steel Stand on Equal Footing
    —A Sideline Report from the National On-site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking in Shangcheng
    By Our Correspondent Ye Jianyun
    The National On-site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking has opened. A broad road for nationwide steelmaking is extending from Shangcheng County, Henan Province, to all directions of the motherland.
    Shangcheng, this county town at the foot of the Dabie Mountains, has now become a metallurgical school attracting national attention. More than 400 representatives from 28 provinces and regions across the country have come here with the attitude of being elementary school students. The chestnuts in the Dabie Mountains are ripening, and wild grapes hang in bunches. The joy of autumn harvest is on everyone's face. No one has ever made such statistics about how many times a person will laugh in a lifetime, but it can be asserted that this year's laughter is more than in any past year. China's 600 million people are all laughing for such a thing.
    Psychologists say that laughter comes from the heart when people gain unexpected harvests. A person who has not studied psychology cannot, of course, give any basis for this. However, everyone has confirmed this assertion through personal experience.
    In Shangcheng, for more than two hundred years, people have called indigenous steelmaking "stir-frying iron" and the steel produced "sheet iron." A month ago, the working group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry came, observed and observed again, and studied and studied again. They were afraid that their own experience was unreliable, so they took this sheet iron to Beijing for testing. As a result, this sheet iron, which has been wronged for many years, has been vindicated and named steel. In order to distinguish it from the steel produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, the word "indigenous" was placed above the steel character of Shangcheng steel, and it was named indigenous steel. It is not necessary to say in which dynasty the word steel first appeared in our country, but according to historical records, during the Warring States period more than two thousand years ago, the famous craftsman Gan Jiang cast a kind of sharp male and female sword. Undoubtedly, this is steel. Indigenous steel! You, a silent character, in the era of Mao Zedong, people have invited you into the commander's mansion.
    There are countless strange and incomprehensible things in the world. China's indigenous steel and the Chinese method of making steel by indigenous methods have existed for thousands of years, but they have never been recognized and valued by people. The foreign steel made by foreigners, if calculated from the birth of the Bessemer converter, was only a hundred years old last year; the time it was introduced into China was even shorter, only sixty years from Zhang Zhidong's Hanyang Ironworks. Thousands of years and decades, this was originally a very large gap in time, but some people insisted that foreign steel with a history of decades was the only good one, while indigenous steel with a history of thousands of years was dispensable and insignificant. Some people even said that indigenous steel is not steel. Why don't some people admit that indigenous steel is steel? They said: it does not look like steel in color, it does not sound like steel when knocked, it feels very rough to the touch, and of course it is impossible to have the properties of steel when used. Therefore, their diagnostic comment is: this is pig iron, not steel. If this is said to be steel, then steelmaking is too easy.
    Is it really so? The facts provided by Shangcheng people and the results of the appraisal by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry are affirmative. This is steel, a Chinese-style steel. It is a low-carbon steel made by low-temperature method. It can be used to make agricultural implements, machines, and various tools and building materials. It is a kind of steel with a wide range of uses. All superstitious people are one-sided.
    Steelmaking, if it is said to be difficult, it is indeed difficult, and if it is said to be easy, it is indeed easy. Saying it is difficult is only because people are standing in front of open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces, and are frightened by that set of wind, electricity, high-pressure, and high-temperature gadgets. Although they are troubled by not being able to get these equipments, they admire these things wholeheartedly. The more they cannot get these equipments, the heavier the mood of calling for difficulties. The more afraid of difficulties, the more superstitious they are about foreign steel.
    Any kind of steelmaking method, foreign or indigenous, is essentially blowing air to oxidize impurities such as carbon and silicon in iron, and adjusting various elements in pig iron so that elements such as carbon, silicon, manganese, nickel, and sulfur meet the requirements. Converters and open-hearth furnaces are like this, electric furnaces are also like this, and so are indigenous furnaces. At the Shangcheng On-site Conference on Indigenous Steelmaking, experts analyzed the production process of indigenous steel, and conducted tests and observations. The conclusion is: it is not inferior to the round, square, and flat steel materials made by foreign methods.
    The Shangcheng-style indigenous steelmaking furnace is like a person with a very good appetite, who does not picky eaters, and it is okay for you to feed it any kind of pig iron raw materials. Pot iron is a kind of bad iron with very high phosphorus content, and white pig iron is a kind of iron with less sand and more sulfur. Foreign furnaces have to go through complicated procedures such as desulfurization and silicon addition; while indigenous furnaces can directly eat it and turn it into low-carbon steel. At present, there are 1.7 million indigenous ironmaking furnaces in the country. With so much indigenous iron, with indigenous steelmaking, it is no longer restricted by the rules and regulations of foreign furnaces. To smelt one ton of steel, only 250 kilograms of firewood and charcoal are needed. How much equipment does a modern steel mill need, and how long does it take to train a skilled worker who operates a converter? This is the most troublesome thing for the director of a steel mill. Now, the director of an indigenous steel mill does not need to think about these problems. Building a furnace costs only more than one hundred yuan, but it can produce one and a half tons of steel every day. Eight people operate each pair of furnaces, and the operating technology can be learned in one or two days.
    Of course, while affirming the benefits of Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking, people did not belittle the benefits of foreign steelmaking. It is just said that on our country's steel front, indigenous steel and foreign steel are on an equal footing. This is the two legs of the steel industry, and we should walk on two legs so that we can take bigger steps. At the same time, we should also ask people to think about such a question: is the foreign method the only method? If our indigenous method is passed on to foreigners, won't it also become a foreign method?
    Shangcheng's indigenous steelmaking is an ordinary discovery. This discovery has paved a broad road for nationwide steelmaking. This is a road to prosperity and strength for the motherland, and also a road to break superstition, open up ideas, and dare to think and dare to act. In the past, didn't some people say that steel cannot be made in rural areas? On October 5th, in the mountain villages of Shangcheng, the hands of peasants who were used to holding sickles and hoes provided 3,000 tons of steel to the country. Shangcheng people were immersed in the laughter of victory. Coming to Shangcheng, you can see a magnificent picture of the future: if each of the more than 2,000 counties distributed on the 9.6 million square kilometers of the motherland builds ten indigenous steelmaking furnaces, there will be more than 20,000 furnaces at once. More than 20,000 furnaces can produce 20,000 to 30,000 tons of indigenous steel every day. In fact, this simple steelmaking method is more than ten in a county!

    土钢洋钢平起平坐
    ——全国土法炼钢商城现场会议侧记
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    全国土法炼钢现场会议开幕了。一个全民炼钢的广阔道路，正在从河南省的商城县，向祖国的东西南北四面八方伸展开去。
    商城，这个大别山麓的县城，如今却成了全国注目的一所冶金学校。来自全国二十八个省区的四百多名代表，他们是抱着当小学生的态度到这儿来了。大别山的栗子黄熟了，野葡萄一串串的。秋天丰收的喜悦，挂在每个人的脸上。谁也没有作过这样的统计，人的一生会笑多少次，但是可以断言，今年的笑声，却比过去的任何一年都要多。我国六亿人民都在为这样一件事情而欢笑。
    心理学家的说法是：当人们获得意外收获的时候，笑声是发自肺腑的。一个没有研究过心理学的人，当然是说不出什么根据来的。可是，每个人通过切身的体会，都证实了这个论断。
    在商城两百多年来，人们都把土法炼钢叫做炒铁，把炼出来的钢叫做板铁。一个月以前，冶金部的工作组来了，观察了再观察，研究了再研究。他们唯恐自己的经验靠不住，又把这种板铁拿到北京去化验。结果，这个含冤多年的板铁，人们给它正名了，名之曰钢。为了和鞍钢出的钢区别一下，在商城钢的钢字上面，冠了个土字，名之曰土钢。我国的钢字最初出现在哪一个朝代，姑且不去说它，但据历史的记载，在两千多年前的战国时代，名匠干将，曾铸成了一种犀利的雌雄宝剑。无疑的，这就是钢。土钢啊！你这个默默无闻的脚色，在毛泽东的时代，人们是把你请进帅府园里来了。
    天下奇怪的不可理解的事情，不知有多少。中国的土钢，中国人用土办法炼钢的方法，存在已经是几千年了，却一直得不到人们的承认和重视。而外国人搞的洋钢，如果从贝氏炼钢炉诞生算起，到去年也不过一百年；传到中国来的时间，那就更短了，从张之洞的汉阳铁政局起，也不过六十来年。几千年和几十年，本来这是一段差距很大的时间，可是有些人，却硬说，几十年历史的洋钢是唯一的好的，而有几千年历史的土钢，是可有可无无足轻重的。甚至还有人说土钢不是钢。为什么有些人不承认土钢是钢呢？他们说：看上去没有钢的颜色，敲起来没有钢的声音，摸上去粗糙得很，用起来当然也就不可能有钢的性能了。因此，他们诊断的评语是：这是毛铁不是钢。如果说这是钢的话，那炼钢就太容易了。
    果真是如此吗？商城人提供的事实，冶金部给它鉴定的结果是肯定的，这是钢，是一种中国式的钢。它是用低温的方法炼出来的低炭钢。可以造农具，也可以造机器，还可以锻造各种工具和建筑材料，是一种用处甚广的钢。凡是迷信的人都是片面的。
    炼钢，说难也的确是难，说容易，也确实容易。说难，只是因为人们站在平炉、转炉、电炉面前，为那一套风气电气，高压高温的玩艺儿吓住了。尽管他们正在为弄不到这些设备而苦恼，但是，他们对这些东西却佩服得五体投地。越是拿不到这些设备，叫困难的心情就越重。愈是畏难，对洋钢也就愈迷信了。
    任何一种炼钢方法，洋的也好，土的也好，本质上都是用空气吹炼、氧化掉铁中的碳、矽等杂质，并调整生铁中的各种元素，使炭矽锰镍硫等元素合乎要求。转炉平炉是如此，电炉也是如此，土炉子又何尝不是如此。在土法炼钢商城现场会议上，专家们分析了土钢的生产过程，进行了化验、观察，结论是：它和洋法炼的圆、方、扁钢料不相上下。
    商城式的土法炼钢炉，就像一个胃口很好的人，不拣嘴，你给它吃什么样的生铁原料都成。锅铁是一种含磷很高的坏铁，白口生铁是含砂少含硫多的一种铁，洋炉子炼起来少不得要经过脱硫加矽等繁复手续；而土炉子哩，却可以直接吃下去变成低炭钢，目前全国有一百七十万个土炼铁炉，这么多的土铁，有了土法炼钢，就不再受洋炉子清规戒律的约束了。而炼一吨钢，只要二百五十斤的木柴和木炭。一个现代化的炼钢厂需要多少设备，一个操作转炉的技术工人，需要培养多长的时间，这是炼钢厂的厂长最恼火的事情，现在一个土法炼钢厂的厂长，他并不需要去想这些问题。建一个炉子只花一百多元，每天却可以出一吨半钢，每对炉子八个人操作，操作技术一两天就可以学会。
    当然人们在肯定商城土法炼钢的好处的同时，并没有贬低洋法炼钢的好处。只是说，在我国的钢铁战线上，土钢和洋钢是平起平坐的，这是钢铁工业的两条腿，应该用两条腿走路，步子才能跨得大。同时，也要人们去想一想这样的问题：洋办法是不是唯一的办法呢？我们的土办法，如果传到外国人那里去的话，它不是也成了洋办法吗？
    商城的土法炼钢是一次普通的发现，这个发现，是为全民炼钢铺开了一条广阔的道路。这是一条使祖国走向繁荣富强的道路，也是一条破除迷信，打开思路，敢想敢干的道路。过去，不是有人说农村不能炼钢吗？10月5日那一天，在商城的山村里，由拿惯了镰刀、锄头的农民的双手，向国家提供了三千吨钢。商城人浸沉在胜利的欢笑声中。来到商城，你可以看到一幅幅未来的壮丽的图景：在祖国九百多万平方公里的地面上分布的两千多个县，如果每个县搞起十个土法炼钢炉子来的话，一下就是两万多个炉子。两万多个炉子，每天就可以出产两万至三万吨的土钢。其实，这种简易的炼钢方法，一个县又何止办十个哩！
