    Hypertension Can Be Completely Cured
    Yang Min
    It is a misunderstanding that hypertension has always been considered an incurable disease. A few days ago, the People's Daily reported that after the Shanghai medical community proposed the bold initiative to basically control hypertension within three years, the Hypertension Research Institute was established to mobilize all positive factors conducive to the research of hypertension in the city, regardless of Chinese, Western, native, or foreign methods, whether acupuncture, Qigong, or medical sports, to control hypertension. Moreover, the Shanghai medical community has found more than 20 kinds of plant medicines in Chinese medicine that can reduce hypertension. Among them, Erxian Decoction (compound), Clerodendrum trichotomum, Cortex Moutan, Glehnia littoralis, and Radix Aristolochiae debilis have been used in clinical practice with significant effects. This is really great news for patients with hypertension!
    In terms of the physique of our people, the systolic blood pressure of normal men is about 100-120, and the diastolic blood pressure is 65-85. The blood pressure of the elderly is often higher than that of the young, and the blood pressure of women is lower than that of men of the same age. Blood pressure is related to diet, daily life, and mood. It is common for it to rise by about 10% occasionally, which is not a symptom of disease. If it persistently exceeds the normal level by more than 20%, it is a sign that it has developed into hypertension.
    Diseases in some parts of the body such as the kidneys, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and gonads can also cause blood pressure to rise, but at this time, high blood pressure is not the main symptom, so it is not considered hypertension. Generally speaking, hypertension refers to hypertension caused by dysfunction of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is the advanced organization that controls all tissues and organs of the body. When its function is impaired, the nerve center that manages blood vessels loses control, resulting in an excited state, which causes blood vessels to spasm, reduce their diameter, increase blood flow resistance, and cause blood pressure to rise. If this state is maintained for too long, the blood vessels (arteries) will gradually harden, and high blood pressure cannot be lowered. At the same time, because the kidneys do not get enough blood, they secrete a substance called renin. Once renin enters the blood, it interacts with angiotensinogen in the blood to form angiotensin, which further increases blood pressure. As for the dysfunction of the cerebral cortex, on the one hand, it may be due to internal stimuli such as brain tumors and arteriosclerosis, but more often it is due to the influence of excessive fatigue or strong anxiety, worry, sadness, and other emotions.
    The significant signs of hypertension are headache, dizziness, chest tightness, insomnia, blurred vision... However, patients in the early or even second stage may not feel anything, so it is easy to ignore and delay treatment. In addition to using drugs or acupuncture, sports, sleep, and other therapies to treat hypertension, the following points should be paid attention to in terms of diet: First, do not eat too salty dishes, because salt can promote the secretion of deoxycorticosterone by the kidneys, causing renal blood vessels to contract, causing renal ischemia, producing renin, and increasing blood pressure. Second, appropriately restrict foods with high cholesterol content such as meat and eggs, because cholesterol will settle on the blood vessel walls and aggravate arteriosclerosis. Third, obese patients should eat less fatty foods to avoid further obesity and increase the burden on the heart. Fourth, cigarettes contain nicotine, which can promote arteriosclerosis, and should be completely prohibited; alcohol contains alcohol, which can stimulate nerves, and should also be drunk in moderation.
    As mentioned earlier, hypertension is mainly due to dysfunction of the cerebral cortex, so special attention should be paid to eliminating mental burdens during treatment. Bai Juyi, a poet of the Tang Dynasty in our country, was a patient with hypertension. He wrote in a poem: "The right eye is blurred and the left foot has wind, gold and stone are useless, it is better to think back to the joy of the Three Vehicles, and then you will get rid of all the diseases in life." Bai Juyi had the poem "I have been working hard for life for a long time, I have not learned the way of health preservation, I have been sick since I was young, how can this body be old" when he was eighteen years old, which shows that his hypertension may have taken root in his youth, but he still enjoyed a high age of seventy-five. This is inseparable from his optimism. Today, if someone suffers from hypertension, they should establish a revolutionary spirit of optimism, so that their thoughts are open and their body and mind are happy. In this way, the dysfunction of the cerebral cortex will naturally gradually improve; otherwise, if the root cause is not eliminated, the drugs will inevitably be difficult to work.

    高血压病完全可以治好
    杨旻
    高血压病一直被认为是一种不治之症，这实在是一种误解。前几天人民日报报道：上海市医学界提出了三年内基本控制高血压病的大胆倡议以后，成立了高血压病研究所，要把全市所有对高血压病研究有利的积极因素，不论中、西、土、洋，不论针灸、气功、医疗体育都调动起来，控制高血压病。而且，上海医药界已在中药中找到了二十多种可供降低高血压的植物药物。其中二仙汤（复方）、臭梧桐、牡丹皮、藓沙参、青木香等已在临床使用，效果显著。这实在是高血压患者的大喜讯！
    就我国人民的体质来说，正常男人的收缩压约在100—120之间，舒张压则为65—85。老年人的血压常比年青人的高，妇女的血压则比同年男子的低一些。血压的高低，同饮食、起居以及情绪等条件都有关系，偶尔升高10％左右是常有的事，不算病象。如果持久的超过正常水平的20％以上，那就是已发展成为高血压病的象征。
    身体有些部位如肾脏、脑垂体、甲状腺、生殖腺发生病变也会引起血压升高，但这时高血压不是主要症状，所以还不算是高血压病。一般所说的高血压病，是指大脑皮层的机能障碍所引起的高血压来说的。大脑皮层是统制全身各组织器官的高级组织，当它的机能产生障碍的时候，管理血管的神经中枢便失去控制，以致陷入兴奋状态，使血管也随之产生痉挛，口径变小，使血流的阻力增大，引起血压上升。这种状态如果维持过久，血管（动脉）便逐渐硬化，高血压也就不能下降。同时，肾脏由于得不到足够的血液，随着分泌出一种叫做肾素的东西来。肾素一进入血液，便和血中原有的高血压素元发生作用，形成高血压素，使血压更加升高。至于大脑皮层的机能障碍，一方面可能是由于脑瘤、动脉硬化等内部的刺激，而更多的是由于过度疲劳或强烈的焦急、忧虑、悲哀等等情绪的影响。
    高血压病的显著征象是头痛、眩晕、胸闷、失眠、眼花……。但初期甚至二期的患者也可能什么都感觉不出，因此容易忽略，延误治疗。治疗高血压病除应用药物或针灸、体育、睡眠等疗法以外，在饮食方面要注意以下几点：一、不可吃太咸的菜食，因为食盐能促进肾脏分泌去氧皮质酮，使肾血管收缩，引起肾脏缺血，产生肾素，使血压升高。二、适当节制肉、蛋等含胆固醇较多的食物，因为胆固醇会沉留于血管壁上，加重血管硬化。三、肥胖的患者要少吃脂肪多的食物，以免进一步肥胖，增加心脏的负担。四、烟中含烟草素，能促使血管硬化，应完全禁止；酒中则含有酒精，能刺激神经，也以少饮为佳。
    前面说过，高血压病主要是由于大脑皮层的机能障碍，所以治疗的时候尤其要注意消除精神上的负担。我国唐代诗人白居易就是一个高血压病患者，他有一首诗写道：“右眼昏花左足风，金篦石水用无功，不如回念三乘乐，便得浮生百病空”。白居易在十八岁便有“久为劳生事，不学摄生道，少年已多病，此身岂堪老”的诗句，可见他的高血压病很可能在少年时候就已扎下了根，可是他毕竟还享受了七十五岁的高年。这和他的乐观主义精神是分不开的。今天如有人患了高血压病，便应该树立起革命的乐观主义精神，使思想开朗，身心愉快，这样大脑皮层的机能障碍自然会逐渐好转，不然，病根不除药物也必将是难以收效的。
