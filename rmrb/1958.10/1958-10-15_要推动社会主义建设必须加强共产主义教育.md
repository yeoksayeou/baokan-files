    To Promote Socialist Construction
    We Must Strengthen Communist Education

“Strengthening Socialist and Communist Education” is the title of the editorial in the third issue of "Xu Yu Shi (虚与实)" monthly magazine, sponsored by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, published on October 1st. The editorial says, with the vigorous development of communist ideology among the people, can we relax the socialist and communist education of the masses? Our answer is no. After analyzing the social roots of various non-proletarian thoughts still existing among some of the masses, the editorial points out that in a socialist society, due to the limitations of the current level of production, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" must be implemented in the distribution of means of livelihood. Only in this way can the development of productive forces be promoted, preparing conditions for the transition to a communist society. However, this equal right, which uses labor as the measure of distribution, as Marx pointed out, "is still in principle bourgeois right," and residual inequality remains here. Those with stronger labor power have higher incomes; families with less labor power and more people have lower incomes. This residual inequality is also the material basis for the generation of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, the communist ideology of public ownership and selflessness, and benefiting others, will continue to struggle with the bourgeois ideology of selfishness, benefiting oneself at the expense of others, for a long time. The editorial emphatically refutes the following erroneous view: "Since we are still a socialist society, and distribution is still 'to each according to his work,' not 'to each according to his needs,' it is enough to promote more pay for more work, and less pay for less work." It says that, of course, the system of distribution of means of livelihood in a socialist society must proceed from the existing level of production and take into account the level of awareness of the majority of the masses, but as a guiding ideology, it must be ahead of the masses. If we relax political and ideological education and do not pay attention to promoting the spirit of communism, but one-sidedly emphasize the stimulation of material interests, then objectively we will encourage the bourgeois ideology of being calculating and concerned with personal interests. Then, the editorial points out that the following issues should be focused on in the socialist and communist education movement. First, vigorously publicize the superiority of the socialist system and the people's communes, publicize the happy prospects of communism, and more firmly establish the determination and confidence of the broad masses of people to take the socialist and communist road and run the people's communes well. The second is to greatly establish the communist ideology of public ownership and selflessness, serving the public, mutual cooperation, and mutual support, and to eliminate individualism and departmentalism. The third is to vigorously promote the spirit of communist labor, develop the habit of loving labor and consciously observing labor discipline, and strive to combine mental and physical labor. Fourth, we must continue to resolutely implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and overcome right-leaning conservatism and the thinking of being content with the middle reaches and being satisfied with backwardness. The editorial concludes by saying that strengthening socialist and communist education for the people and promoting the victorious advancement of socialist and communist cause is a fundamental task for us on the ideological front.

    要推动社会主义建设
    必须加强共产主义教育
    “加强社会主义和共产主义教育”，这是10月1日出版的中共安徽省委主办的“虚与实”月刊第三期的社论题目。社论说，在人民群众共产主义思想蓬勃发展的情况之下，对群众的社会主义和共产主义教育是否可以放松一些呢？我们的回答是否定的。社论在分析了在一部分群众中还存在各种非无产阶级思想的社会根源后指出，在社会主义社会里，由于现有生产水平的限制，在生活资料的分配上，必须实行“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则，只有这样，才能促进生产力的发展，为过渡到共产主义社会准备条件。但是，这种以劳动做为分配尺度的平等权利，正如马克思所指出的，“在原则上仍然是资产阶级法权”，在这里，还残留着不平等现象。有的人劳动力强些，收入就多些；有的家庭劳动力少，人口多，收入就少些。这种残余的不平等现象，也是产生资产阶级思想的物质基础。因此大公无私、舍己为人的共产主义思想，同自私自利、损人利己的资产阶级思想还会长期地进行斗争。社论着重地批驳了这样一种错误观点：“既然我们现在还是社会主义社会，在分配上还只是‘按劳取酬’，而不是‘各取所需’，只要宣传多劳多得、少劳少得就够了。”它说，当然，社会主义社会的生活资料分配制度，必须从现有的生产水平出发，并且照顾到多数群众的觉悟程度，但是作为指导思想，就必须走在群众的前面。如果我们放松了政治思想教育，不注意发扬共产主义的精神，而是片面地强调物质利益的刺激，那末在客观上就会鼓励斤斤计较个人利益的资产阶级思想。接着，社论指出，在社会主义和共产主义教育运动中应该着重解决以下一些问题。第一是大力宣传社会主义制度和人民公社的优越性，宣传共产主义的幸福前景，更加坚定广大人民走社会主义和共产主义道路，办好人民公社的决心和信心。第二是要大立大公无私、舍己为公、互相协作、互相支援的共产主义思想，破除个人主义和本位主义思想。第三是要大力发扬共产主义劳动的精神，养成热爱劳动、自觉地遵守劳动纪律的习惯，努力做到脑力劳动同体力劳动相结合。第四是必须继续坚决贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，克服右倾保守、甘居中游、安于落后的思想。社论最后说，加强对人民的社会主义和共产主义教育，推动社会主义和共产主义事业胜利前进，是我们在思想战线上的一项根本任务。
