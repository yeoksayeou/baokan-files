Xinhua News Agency, October 14th: TASS reports that the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement on October 13th regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, refuting the malicious slanders made by the American press against the Soviet Union on this issue.

The statement pointed out that recently, messages have continuously appeared in the American press distorting the Soviet Union's position on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the establishment of international supervision over agreements to halt nuclear testing. They falsely claim that the Soviet Union opposes the establishment of an international supervision system and opposes international inspections within Soviet territory.

The statement said that in light of this situation, the Soviet delegation attending the 13th session of the United Nations General Assembly believes it is necessary to remind everyone that the Soviet government has thoroughly studied the results of the Geneva Experts' Conference and has announced its complete agreement with all the conclusions and recommendations included in the experts' report regarding a universal system of supervision for the cessation of nuclear tests. The Soviet representative formally announced this again in the First Committee on October 10, 1958.

However, as everyone knows, neither the US government nor the British or French governments (whose experts also signed the conclusions and recommendations of the Geneva Conference) have yet announced their agreement with these conclusions and recommendations.

From this, it is clear that the claim that the Soviet Union opposes the establishment of international supervision for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, including supervision within Soviet territory, is absolutely inconsistent with the actual situation. The appearance of such messages in the American press is needed by the advocates of the atomic arms race, and it seems that they want to mislead the public and conceal the fact that the US government is unwilling to immediately and unconditionally permanently cease nuclear weapons testing.

The statement pointed out that the resolution of the problem of stopping nuclear weapons tests is only being obstructed by the position of Western countries, primarily the United States. Therefore, the problem lies with them, and not with the Soviet Union.

### 苏联代表团斥美国报刊故意歪曲  阻挠停止核试验的是美国而不是苏联

    苏联代表团斥美国报刊故意歪曲
    阻挠停止核试验的是美国而不是苏联
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联出席联合国大会代表团13日就停止核武器试验问题发表了一项声明，驳斥美国报刊在这一问题上对苏联所进行的恶意的诬蔑。
    声明指出最近美国报刊上接连出现消息，歪曲苏联在停止试验核武器和对停止试验核武器协定建立国际监督问题上的立场，硬说苏联反对建立国际监督制度，反对在苏联境内进行国际视察。
    声明说对于这种情况，出席联合国大会第十三届会议的苏联代表团认为必须提醒：苏联政府详细地研究了日内瓦专家会议的成果，并且宣布完全同意专家报告中所包括的有关普遍停止核试验的监督制度的全部结论和建议。苏联代表于1958年10月10日在第一委员会再次正式宣布了这一点。
    但是，大家知道，无论美国政府，无论英、法政府（这些国家的专家都在日内瓦会议结论和建议上签了字），直到现在还没有宣布同意这些结论和建议。
    由此可见，硬说苏联反对就停止试验核武器建立国际监督，其中也包括在苏联境内的监督的消息，是绝对不符合实际情况的。这类消息在美国报刊上的出现，是原子军备竞赛的鼓吹者所需要的，看来是想借此把公众引入歧途，并掩盖美国政府不愿意立即无条件地永久停止试验核武器这个事实。
    声明指出，停止试验核武器问题的解决只是受到西方国家、首先是美国的立场的阻挠。因此，问题在于它们，而不在苏联。
