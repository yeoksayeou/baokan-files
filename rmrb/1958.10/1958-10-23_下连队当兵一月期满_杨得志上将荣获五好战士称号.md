Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 22nd. General Yang Dezhi, Commander of the Jinan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Major General Li Yaowen, Director of the Political Department, Major General Chen Meizao, Director of the Cadre Department, and thirteen other cadres who went down to the company to serve as soldiers, left their companies on the 19th, ending a month of life as soldiers.

Before leaving the company, the company held squad meetings and branch committee meetings to appraise each cadre who served as a soldier.

The Fourth Squad's appraisal of Yang Dezhi was: "He obeys the leadership of the squad leader, abides by the rules, unites with comrades and loves them, has a strong sense of labor, studies diligently, and achieved three excellent and one good in four shooting practices, becoming an excellent shooter in the company and a role model for us to learn from." Yang Dezhi, Li Yaowen, Chen Meizao, Chen Xinhua, Director of Military Training, Yu Tao, Staff Officer, and three others were named "Five-Good Soldiers," and the soldiers also gave them honorary corsages.

In order to bid farewell to Yang Dezhi and other cadres who went down to the company to serve as soldiers, the company specially held a farewell heart-to-heart meeting. Yang Dezhi said at the meeting: "We are only temporarily separated, and I will definitely come to see you." Chen Meizao said: "When I go down to the company to serve as a soldier again next year, I would still like to go to the Sixth Company and live with everyone." Li Yaowen expressed to everyone: "Although I have left the Sixth Company, I must ensure that even though I am not there in person, my heart is; even though my body is not there, my thoughts are. I will always maintain the identity of an ordinary soldier." Yang Dezhi also suggested that their names be included in the Sixth Company's roster, and he is willing to always be a private in the Sixth Company.

After Yang Dezhi left the company and arrived at his residence, he suddenly found an apple wrapped in paper, three pieces of candy, and a letter of appreciation in his satchel. He opened the letter and saw that it was secretly given to him by his comrade in the same squad, Niu Zongquan. (Attached picture)

    下连队当兵一月期满
    杨得志上将荣获五好战士称号
    新华社济南22日电　中国人民解放军济南地区部队司令员杨得志上将、政治部主任李耀文少将、干部部长陈美藻少将等十三名下连当兵的干部，已在19日离开了连队，结束了一个月的战士生活。
    离开连队之前，连队召开班务会和支委会对每个当兵干部都进行了鉴定。
    四班对杨得志的鉴定是：服从班长领导，遵守制度，团结友爱好，劳动观念强，勤学苦练，四次射击三次优秀，一次良好，成为连的优等射手，是我们学习的榜样。杨得志、李耀文、陈美藻、军训处长陈新华、参谋于涛等五人被评为“五好战士”，战士们还给他们戴上了光荣花。
    为欢送杨得志等下连当兵的干部离开连队，连里专门举行了欢送谈心会。杨得志在会上说：“我们只是暂时的分别，我一定来看望大家。”陈美藻说：“明年再下连当兵的时候，我还愿意到六连，和大家一起生活。”李耀文向大家表示：“我虽然离开了六连，但是我一定要做到人不在，心在；身体不在，思想在。始终保持一个普通士兵的身份。”杨得志还建议，将他们的名字列入六连的花名册，他愿意永远作为六连的一名列兵。
    杨得志离开连队到自己的住处以后，突然发现自己的挎包里用纸包着一个苹果三块糖，还有一封慰问信，拆开信一看，原来是他同班的战友牛宗全偷偷地送给他的。（附图片）
