Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch from Buenos Aires: The Argentine "Forum" published a commentary on September 5th entitled "China's Rights," strongly condemning the U.S. government's shameless provocative actions against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area.

The article stated that it must be admitted that the imperialists have one "strength," and that is: they are good at constantly maintaining a source of war provocation in some part of the world. The article pointed out that the United States suffered a diplomatic defeat not long ago at the United Nations General Assembly's emergency special session. However, the American rulers, who serve the interests of monopoly capitalists, have brought the torch to the Seventh Fleet and the threat of atomic war to the wings of bombers, which is truly the most shameless thing imaginable.

The article demanded that the U.S. military withdraw from the Taiwan Strait area. The article emphasized that just as Tierra del Fuego is Argentine territory, Taiwan is also an integral part of Chinese territory. The presence of the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait and the existence of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and its diplomatic recognition are absurd.

The article concluded by pointing out that the People's Republic of China has the legitimate right to defend the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. The American interventionists, despised by ten thousand people, are seriously threatening world peace.

### 万人唾弃美国干涉者  阿根廷“论坛报”谴责美国无耻挑衅

    万人唾弃美国干涉者
    阿根廷“论坛报”谴责美国无耻挑衅
    新华社29日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷“论坛报”9月5日以“中国的权利”为题发表评论，严厉谴责美国政府在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的无耻挑衅行动。
    文章说，必须承认，帝国主义者有一点“长处”，这就是：它们善于经常在世界上某一个地方维持战争挑衅的策源地。文章指出，美国不久以前在联大紧急特别会议上遭到了一次外交失败。可是，为垄断资本家利益效劳的美国统治者又把火把带到了第七舰队上，把原子战争的威胁带到了轰炸机的翅膀上，这真是再无耻不过的事了。
    文章要求美国军队从台湾海峡地区撤退。文章强调指出，像火地岛是阿根廷的领土一样，台湾也是中国领土的组成部分。美国第七舰队在台湾海峡的出现，蒋介石政权的存在和它在外交上的被承认，都是荒谬的。
    文章最后指出，中华人民共和国有保卫它的领土主权完整的合法权利。万人唾弃的美国干涉者正在严重地威胁着世界和平。
