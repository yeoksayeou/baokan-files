Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 3rd October: Anhui Province has achieved a splendid victory on this year's agricultural production front. The total grain output for the entire year can reach 55 billion to 60 billion jin, an increase of 122.6% to 142.9% compared to last year's 24.7 billion jin. The average yield per mu can be increased from 302 jin last year to 708 jin this year. The average grain per person is over 1,700 jin. Cotton production can reach 3 million dan, a two-fold increase compared to last year, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu can exceed 80 jin. Currently, the people of the entire province are celebrating this year's overall bumper harvest in agriculture.

Of the province's total grain output this year, the summer harvest crops reached 8.524 billion jin, an increase of over 62% compared to last year. The total output of early rice reached 6.26 billion jin, an increase of over 240% compared to last year. More than 10 million mu out of over 20 million mu of intermediate rice have been harvested, with an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The late autumn crops, with a planting area of over 8 million mu this year, are also expected to have a bumper harvest. The total output of oil crops can reach over 10 million dan, an increase of more than 100% compared to last year. Other crops such as tobacco, tea, hemp, silkworm cocoons, aquatic products, live pigs, and large livestock have also seen significant increases compared to last year.

This year, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of people in Anhui Province have displayed soaring enthusiasm. In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, nearly 6 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were moved for water conservancy projects throughout the province, equivalent to four times the total amount of earth and stone completed in the eight years after liberation, greatly reducing the impact of floods and droughts. The total amount of accumulated fertilizer was 160 billion dan, an average of nearly 2,000 dan per mu. This year, in order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, the farmers of the province also waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, successively overcoming cold waves, rice stem borers, rust diseases, and drought.

On the basis of this year's bumper harvest, and inspired by the upsurge of the People's Commune movement, the people of the province are currently actively preparing to invest in large-scale water conservancy projects, working hard for another winter and spring to realize a network of rivers in the Huaibei and southern Anhui hilly areas, and to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer and improve the soil. More than 200 billion dan of autumn fertilizer have already been accumulated, and more than 5.3 million mu of autumn cultivated land have been deeply plowed to a depth of one to three chi.
