    Create Glorious Achievements of Shangganling on All Fronts
    Speech by Guo Moruo at the Capital's Welcome Rally for the Returning Volunteers
    Dear Comrades and Friends:
    Today, people from all walks of life in the capital are gathering here solemnly, with boundless excitement, to welcome our most beloved people - the victorious return of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    The Chinese People's Volunteers have completely withdrawn from Korea. The last batch, including the officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army headquarters, arrived in Andong the day before yesterday, October 26th. Today, a 150-member delegation of the Volunteer Army, headed by Commander Yang Yong and Political Commissar Wang Ping, including many famous combat heroes, has arrived in Beijing. Now, please allow me to announce that our meeting, on behalf of the 650 million people of the motherland, extends the warmest welcome, the highest respect, and the most heartfelt gratitude to all commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, and to all comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers delegation!
    Eight years ago, the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea, extending the flames of war to our country's border and simultaneously occupying our country's territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people launched the great nationwide movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, bravely crossed the Yalu River with boundless anger and hatred towards the American bandits, fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army. With the full support of the Korean people and the people of the motherland, and with the support of the powerful world peace forces led by the great Soviet Union, they dealt the American aggressors the heaviest blow, driving them back south of the 38th parallel and forcing them to sign the armistice agreement. The Chinese People's Volunteers exposed the American paper tiger in front of the people of the world. It proved that the people of China and Korea under the banner of Marxism-Leninism are invincible. This was a great victory of historical significance for the people of China and Korea. This was a great victory of historical significance for the cause of peace and justice. People all over the world who love peace and strive for national independence have gained tremendous strength and encouragement from this victory. Comrades, let us jointly express our warm congratulations on the great victory of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country!
    During the eight years that the Chinese People's Volunteers were in Korea, they received the full support and meticulous care of the Korean fathers, elders, brothers and sisters. Here, let our meeting, on behalf of the people of the whole country, express our heartfelt gratitude and respect to the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean government headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, to all the Korean people and the Korean People's Army! We wish the Korean people new victories in the great cause of building socialism and peacefully unifying the motherland, and wish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea further prosperity and strength!
    The fraternal friendship between the people of China and Korea has a long history. The fighting friendship forged with blood by the people of China and Korea through the common struggle against the aggression of American imperialism has been further consolidated and developed, and is invincible by any imperialist force. Let our two peoples unite more closely, encourage each other, learn from each other, help each other, and strive together for the common great victory for our common cause!
    Dear comrades of the Volunteer Army delegation, we have been separated from you for eight years, and today we gather here together, feeling unparalleled joy and happiness in our hearts. You are the glory of the motherland, the pride of the motherland, and the Party's most outstanding children. The merits you have established on the Korean battlefield, and the high degree of socialist mutual assistance you have demonstrated in helping the Korean people restore their construction work, have left brilliant pages in human history. Your high degree of patriotism and internationalism will always be a model for the people of the whole country to learn from. Today, you have victoriously completed the sacred mission of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, and have returned from Korea. The motherland in the Great Leap Forward welcomes you to participate in the various positions of the socialist construction cause, and create the glorious achievements of Shangganling on all fronts! The people of the whole country must learn from you and always be with you, go all out, aim high, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, strive for a great, thorough, comprehensive, and eternal victory in developing socialist construction and completing the great cause of unifying the motherland!

    在各个战线创造上甘岭的辉煌战绩
    郭沫若在首都欢迎志愿军归国大会上的致词亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    今天，首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，以无限兴奋的心情，欢迎我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军胜利归国。
    中国人民志愿军已经全军撤出了朝鲜。最后一批包括志愿军总部官兵在内，已经在前天10月26日到达了安东。今天，以杨勇司令员和王平政治委员为首的、包括了许多著名战斗英雄在内的一个一百五十人的志愿军代表团来到了北京。现在，请允许我宣布，让我们的大会，代表祖国六亿五千万人民，向祖国的英雄儿女——中国人民志愿军全体指战员，向中国人民志愿军代表团全体同志，表示最热烈的欢迎、最崇高的敬意和最衷心的感谢！
    八年前，美国侵略者发动了侵朝战争，把战火烧到我国的边境，并同时侵占了我国的领土台湾。中国人民发动了伟大的抗美援朝、保家卫国的全民运动。由中国人民的优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，为了保卫祖国、维护亚洲和世界的和平，带着对美国强盗的无比的愤怒和憎恨，英勇地跨过鸭绿江，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在朝鲜人民和祖国人民的全力支援下，在以伟大苏联为首的强大世界和平力量的支持下，给予了美国侵略者以最沉重的打击，把他们驱逐到三八线以南，迫使他们在停战书上签了字。中国人民志愿军在世界人民面前戳穿了美国纸老虎。证明了在马克思列宁主义旗帜之下的中朝两国人民是不可战胜的。这是中朝两国人民的一次具有历史意义的伟大胜利。这是和平和正义事业的一次具有历史意义的伟大胜利。全世界爱好和平和争取民族独立的人民，都从这一胜利中获得巨大力量和鼓舞。同志们，让我们共同对抗美援朝、保家卫国运动的伟大胜利表示热烈的庆贺！
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的八年间，得到了朝鲜父老兄弟姊妹们的全力支援和无微不至的关怀。在这里，让我们的大会代表全国人民向以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府，向全体朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，表示衷心的感谢和敬意！祝朝鲜人民在建设社会主义和和平统一祖国的伟大事业中获得新的胜利，祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进一步的繁荣和富强！
    中朝两国人民的兄弟友谊是有悠久历史的。中朝两国人民经过反抗美帝国主义略侵的共同斗争进一步巩固和发展起来的用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，是任何帝国主义势力所不能战胜的。让我们两国人民更紧密地团结起来，相互勉励，相互学习，相互援助，为我们的共同事业争取共同的伟大胜利而共同奋斗！
    亲爱的志愿军代表团全体同志们，我们和你们阔别了八年，今天在这里聚集一堂，心中感到无上的欢喜和幸福。你们是祖国的光荣，是祖国的骄傲，是党的最优秀的子弟。你们在朝鲜战场上立下的功勋，在帮助朝鲜人民恢复建设事业中所发挥的高度的社会主义互助精神，在人类历史上，留下了光辉灿烂的篇页。你们的高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神将永远是全国人民学习的榜样。你们今天胜利地完成抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣使命从朝鲜回来了，大跃进中的祖国欢迎你们参加到社会主义建设事业的各个岗位上去，在各个战线都产生出上甘岭的辉煌战绩！全国人民都要向你们看齐，并永远和你们一道，鼓足干劲，力争上游，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，为发展社会主义建设和完成祖国统一的伟大事业取得伟大的彻底的全面的永恒的胜利而奋斗！
