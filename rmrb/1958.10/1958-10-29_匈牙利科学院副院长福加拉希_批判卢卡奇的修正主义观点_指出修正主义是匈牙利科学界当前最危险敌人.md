Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 22nd: Béla Fogarasi, Vice President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, said at an annual meeting of the Academy today that revisionism is currently the most dangerous enemy of the Hungarian scientific community. Modern revisionism, especially the ideas of so-called "national characteristics, national communism" emphasized by Imre Nagy, is essentially a national chauvinistic plus revisionist viewpoint. This is related to the influence of Yugoslav revisionists distorting "different roads to socialism" with nationalistic views.

Fogarasi made a report on the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism in the Hungarian scientific field at the annual meeting of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, which opened today. He focused on criticizing the revisionist views of György Lukács, a representative figure of Hungarian revisionism.

He pointed out that Lukács used the pretext of opposing dogmatism to promote revisionism. Lukács believes that in historical development, the important contradiction of our era is not the contradiction between capitalism and socialism, but the contradiction between progress and reaction. Lukács remained on his basic position of "anti-fascist nationalism" and "anti-fascist humanism" style "democracy." He replaces socialism with anti-fascist democracy.

Fogarasi said that Lukács shouted about "opposing Stalinism" during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary events, but in fact, there is no "Stalinism" at all. Lukács' so-called "opposition to Stalinism" is essentially a distortion of Marxism-Leninism and opposition to the application and development of Marxism-Leninism. This prominent modern revisionist view can be found everywhere in the Yugoslav Communist program.

Fogarasi pointed out that Lukács is one of the members of the Presidium of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. But he has not changed his attitude until now.

Fogarasi also pointed out that in socialist construction, if scientific workers want to make greater contributions, they must be proficient in Marxism-Leninism and possess a dialectical-materialist viewpoint. He said that in the past few years, we have mainly opposed dogmatism, and the most dangerous enemy at present is revisionism.

The annual meeting is expected to end on the 28th. In addition to discussing Fogarasi's report, the annual meeting will also summarize the work of various departments and discuss the development direction of Hungarian scientific undertakings.

Representatives of the Academies of Sciences of various socialist countries also participated in the annual meeting.

    批判卢卡奇的修正主义观点
    指出修正主义是匈牙利科学界当前最危险敌人
    新华社布达佩斯22日电　匈牙利科学院副院长福加拉希·贝洛今天在科学院举行的一次年会上说，修正主义是匈牙利科学界当前最危险的敌人。现代修正主义，特别是纳吉·伊姆雷所强调的所谓“民族特点、民族共产主义”思想，实质上是民族沙文主义加修正主义的观点。这同南斯拉夫修正主义者以民族主义观点歪曲“社会主义的不同道路”的影响有关。
    福加拉希在今天开幕的匈牙利科学院年会上作了有关匈牙利科学领域中马克思列宁主义和修正主义的斗争的报告。他着重批判了匈牙利修正主义的代表人物卢卡奇的修正主义观点。
    他指出，卢卡奇借口反对教条主义来宣扬修正主义。卢卡奇认为，在历史发展中，我们时代的重要矛盾不是资本主义和社会主义之间的矛盾，而是进步和反动之间的矛盾。卢卡奇停留在他的“反法西斯的民族主义”、“反法西斯的人道主义”式的“民主”的基本立场上。他用反法西斯的民主来代替社会主义。
    福加拉希说，卢卡奇在匈牙利反革命事件时期就叫喊什么“反对斯大林主义”，但是，事实上根本不存在“斯大林主义”。卢卡奇所谓的“反对斯大林主义”，实质上是歪曲马克思列宁主义和反对运用和发展马克思列宁主义。这种突出的现代修正主义的观点，在南共纲领中到处都可以找到。
    福加拉希指出，卢卡奇是匈牙利科学院主席团委员之一。但是他直到现在还未改变态度。
    福加拉希还指出，在社会主义建设中，科学工作者要想作出更大的贡献，就必须精通马克思列宁主义，具备唯物辩证观点。他说，过去几年来，我们主要是反对教条主义，而当前最危险的敌人则是修正主义。
    这次年会预计到28日结束。年会除讨论福加拉希的报告外，还将总结各部门的工作和讨论匈牙利科学事业发展的方针。
    参加这次年会的还有各社会主义国家的科学院代表。
