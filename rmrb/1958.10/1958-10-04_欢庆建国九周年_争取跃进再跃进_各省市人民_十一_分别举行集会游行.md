    Celebrating the Ninth Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation, Striving for Leap Forward After Leap Forward.
    People in Various Provinces and Cities Held Rallies and Parades on "October 1st" Respectively
    Jiangsu
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the more than 40 million people of Jiangsu Province, in cities, in the countryside, on steel construction sites, on various production fronts, and at their work posts, celebrated the ninth anniversary of the National Day with pride and joy. In the past year, all aspects of work in Jiangsu have made tremendous leaps forward. On the eve of National Day, the province launched five brilliant "satellites." These are: a province with a daily output of 10,000 tons of pig iron, a province with a per-mu yield of 1,000 jin of grain, a province that has basically eliminated illiteracy and schistosomiasis, a province where all rural areas have been communized, and a province where all the people are armed. The Third Company of Qingfeng Steel Plant in Wuxi City produced 65% more iron on National Day than on the day they launched their "satellite." The workers said, "Every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. Increasing steel production is celebrating National Day."
    In the countryside, many people's communes began to implement a grain supply system starting from National Day. People participated in the first National Day banquet without having to spend their own money, with infinite gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    Shanxi
    The broad masses of the people in Shanxi Province celebrated the National Day with joyous labor and a bumper harvest, launching a production competition to further leap forward in steel and agricultural production. The content of this year's National Day celebration in the rural areas of Shanxi Province was to celebrate the achievements of this year's Great Leap Forward while launching a mobilization meeting to strive for an even greater leap forward next year. On the eve of National Day, the Hongzhao County Party Committee in Jinnan Plain convened a production on-site meeting for cadres of people's communes in the Xiong Huo People's Commune, exchanged experiences, and arranged action plans. On National Day, after dining together, the commune members in each commune immediately launched a competition movement of "promoting summer with autumn," striving for a greater leap forward with greater enthusiasm and more measures. While celebrating the ninth anniversary of National Day, they also put forward the slogan of welcoming the tenth anniversary of National Day with production achievements. On this day, more than 300 Yangko teams in Xiyang County in the Taihang Mountains were active in the fields and construction sites, singing and dancing, making all the commune members happy and energetic. At the same time, more than 1,500 National Day production exhibition halls and exhibition platforms were held in various villages throughout the county, displaying more than 24,000 pieces of agricultural products and various model charts, focusing on publicizing the achievements and experiences of this year's bumper harvest.
    Jilin
    The vast rural areas of Jilin Province, which have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture, were particularly lively this "October 1st." On this day, from the mountains to the plains, there were firecrackers, drums, and red flags everywhere. People of all ethnic groups dressed up in colorful costumes and enjoyed the three happy events—National Day, bumper harvest, and the arrival of people's communes. Many farmers who have been culturally emancipated also composed poems and paintings to praise the National Day. The Dongsheng People's Commune in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, launched a poetry creation movement to welcome National Day, creating more than 500 poems on "October 1st" alone. Commune member Du Weixin recited the poem "Good News Spreads Everywhere" at the celebration meeting: The sun has not set, the gongs and drums are ringing, the singing is rising everywhere, and the Yangko dance is joyful. The sun has not set, the firecrackers are ringing, the people's commune is established, and everyone is smiling.
    Currently, during the busy autumn harvest season, the broad masses of commune members are celebrating National Day with practical actions and opposing the military provocations of the US imperialist aggressors. Many communes have launched a large-scale production movement of harvesting, turning over the land, and building water conservancy projects at the same time, striving for a greater harvest next year. In order to welcome National Day, the Hujia production team of the Lamadianzi People's Commune in Lishu County worked hard for five days and nights and completed the harvesting task by September 28, a week ahead of schedule. On the eve of National Day, the Lingxia People's Commune in Baicheng County in the west worked hard for three nights and harvested 100 hectares, which would allow the harvesting task to be completed five days in advance. Wangqing County, which has already reached the agricultural development program target of 400 jin per mu, formulated a production plan for 800 jin per mu next year at the county's celebration meeting. This plan was enthusiastically supported by representatives of various communes.
    Shandong
    More than 100,000 people in Jinan City held a celebration meeting for the 1958 National Day. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, presented the National Day with the great achievement of producing 14,000 tons of iron on September 30 and guaranteeing the realization of 70 billion jin of grain at the celebration meeting. A militia mixed division was very noticeable in the parade. Among them were sailors, paratroopers, radio soldiers, medical soldiers and motorized soldiers. They were carrying various light and heavy weapons, all of them full of energy and high morale.
    The broad masses of rural areas in Shandong widely carried out various celebration activities. At the "National Day Celebration and Agricultural Bumper Harvest Joint Party" in the Beiyuan People's Commune of Licheng County, which Chairman Mao had inspected, people "toasted to Chairman Mao's health!" The members of the Beiyuan People's Commune, whose grain yield per unit area increased by more than two times compared with last year, vegetables increased by more than one time compared with last year, and industrial output value increased by more than one time compared with last year, prepared a very rich wine party. The famous Shandong Bai Gan, a large carp weighing more than two jins, and all kinds of cold dishes were very delicious and comfortable to eat. The 5.2 million people in the Heze area of southwestern Shandong held celebration meetings in people's communes and generally had meals together in canteens.
    Jiangxi
    The mobilization of the whole people to fight for steel was a feature of the celebration meeting for the ninth anniversary of the founding of the country held by more than 100,000 people in Nanchang City. The parade held up various huge charts and new products. These charts and new products show that the daily output of pig iron in the province had exceeded 5,000 tons by September 29. The parading people also constantly sang and celebrated this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture and the comprehensive realization of communization. While celebrating, the people of Nanchang City expressed their infinite anger and strong condemnation of the US imperialist occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, their attempt to interfere in our people's liberation of Jinmen and Mazu, and their war provocation of using Chiang Kai-shek to attack us with missiles.
    Hunan
    Five million people in urban and rural areas of Hunan gathered and paraded, celebrating the National Day with joy.

More than 30,000 militiamen in the revolutionary base area of Pingjiang County, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition, also wrote a guarantee on National Day, determined to actively strengthen military training and become excellent soldiers who are both workers, farmers and soldiers, ready to take up guns to defend the motherland at any time.

    各省市人民“十一”分别举行集会游行
    江苏
    据新华社讯  江苏省四千多万人民，在城市、在农村、在钢铁工地、在各个生产战线和工作岗位上，怀着自豪的心情，愉快地庆祝国庆九周年。这一年来，江苏各方面的工作，都有了巨大的跃进。在国庆节前夕，全省射出了五颗光芒万丈的大卫星。这就是：日产生铁万吨省、亩产粮食千斤省、基本扫除文盲和基本消灭血吸虫病省、全省农村人民公社化、全省人民武装化。无锡市庆丰钢铁厂第三连在国庆节产的铁，比放卫星那天还高65％，工人们表示：“一寸光阴一寸金，增产钢铁就是庆国庆”。
    在农村，不少人民公社从国庆节开始实行粮食供给制。人们怀着对共产党、对毛主席无限感激的心情，参加第一次不要自己花钱的国庆节聚餐。
    山西
    山西省广大人民以欢乐劳动庆祝丰收欢度国庆，展开了钢铁生产和农业生产再跃进的生产竞赛活动。山西省农村今年庆祝国庆节的内容是一边庆祝今年大跃进的成就，一边已发出了争取明年更大跃进的动员会。晋南平川洪赵县县委在国庆节前夕召集全县人民公社干部在雄伙人民公社举行了生产现场会议，交流了经验，安排了行动计划。国庆节这天，各公社社员在聚餐之后，立即掀起“以秋促夏”的竞赛运动，要以更大的干劲、更多的措施，争取更大的跃进，并且在庆祝国庆九周年的同时，就提出了以生产成绩迎接国庆十周年的口号。太行山区昔阳县这一天有三百多个秧歌队活跃在田间工地上，吹弹歌唱，使广大社员个个欢乐，人人精神振作。与此同时，全县各个村还举办了庆祝国庆节生产展览馆和展览台一千五百多个，展出农产品和各种模型图表二万四千多件，着重宣传今年大丰收的成就和经验。

    目前，正值秋收繁忙期间，广大社员以实际行动庆祝国庆、反对美帝侵略者进行军事挑衅。许多公社掀起了边秋收、边翻地、边修水利的大生产运动，争取明年的更大丰收。梨树县喇嘛店子人民公社胡家作业区，为迎接国庆，曾苦战五昼夜，到9月28日就完成了收割任务，比原计划提前了一个星期。西部白城县岭下人民公社国庆前夕苦战三夜，收割百垧，可使收割任务提前完成五天。已经达到农业发展纲要指标亩产四百斤的汪清县，在全县的庆祝大会上，制订了明年亩产八百斤的生产规划，这规划受到了各公社代表的热烈拥护。山　东
