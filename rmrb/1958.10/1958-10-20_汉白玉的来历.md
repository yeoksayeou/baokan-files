The Origin of White Marble
    Shigong

    Anyone who has been to Beijing will feel that without white marble, many of Beijing's famous scenic spots would be less impressive. The majestic ornamental columns in front of Tiananmen Square and the beautiful stone railings on the shore of Beihai Park are all made of white marble. The Forbidden City, the Summer Palace... everywhere you can find buildings made of white marble. The newly completed Ming Tombs Reservoir also selected white marble to inlay Chairman Mao's inscription on the dam.

    White marble is white in color, firm in texture, and not afraid of weathering, making it a superior building material. What kind of rock is white marble? It is a type of marble. When the chemical composition of marble is pure, it is white; when it is mixed with impurities, it has color. The chemical composition of marble is the same as limestone, which is calcium carbonate. Speaking of which, limestone is the predecessor of marble. Marble is different from igneous rocks and sedimentary rocks. It is not formed by the solidification of magma, nor by the accumulation of sediment, but by the transformation of limestone. However, limestone does not have calcium carbonate crystals, while in marble, calcium carbonate becomes fine-grained crystals.

    What causes the internal substances of limestone to recrystallize? This is mainly due to the effect of high temperature. Increased pressure also has an impact. Where does the high temperature come from? From the intrusion of magma. When magma intrudes into limestone, the area closest to the magma is not only baked by heat, but also affected by the gases and liquids separated from the magma. At this time, it is not just the internal structure that is rearranged, but the composition also changes, transforming into another new type of rock.

    Not only limestone, but all other rocks can also undergo changes in their internal structure and even composition due to high temperature, high pressure, and the infiltration of new substances, resulting in the formation of new rocks. This process of change is called metamorphism. The newly formed rocks are called metamorphic rocks.

    Under the action of strong pressure, the minerals inside many metamorphic rocks are arranged in parallel, appearing like bands. Some can even be split into pieces. Slate, which is transformed from clay, can be opened into thin slabs. Sometimes the minerals inside the rock are crushed and then re-cemented. But sometimes new minerals are formed during metamorphism, such as talc and mica, some of which have beautiful crystal shapes. For example, the chrysanthemum stones produced in the Western Hills of Beijing and Liuyang, Hunan, are formed because crystals of andalusite were produced in the stone during metamorphism. The outer forms of these crystals are clustered and radiate in all directions, like chrysanthemums.

    Metamorphism can not only generate minerals such as andalusite, but also form important mineral resources. The world's largest Soviet Kursk iron ore was found in quartzite transformed from sandstone. The large iron ore recently discovered in central Jiangxi Province is also found in metamorphic rocks. In addition, some mineral resources such as copper, molybdenum, and tungsten are also found in metamorphic rocks. In fact, many metamorphic rocks are themselves mineral resources, such as marble, quartzite, gneiss, and slate. They are all good building materials.

    When the earth's crust undergoes orogenic movements, it generates huge squeezing forces. Sometimes this force can also be converted into heat, often causing large-scale metamorphism. During orogenic movements, it is also often the time when magma is most active, so these effects are not isolated.

    汉白玉的来历
    石工
    到过北京的人都会感到：假使没有汉白玉，北京的许多名胜将要减色不少；天安门前雄伟的华表，北海岸边美丽的石栏杆，都是汉白玉造成的。故宫、颐和园……到处都可以碰到用汉白玉的建筑物。新近完成的十三陵水库，也选中了汉白玉来嵌镶大坝上毛主席的题字。
    汉白玉色白、质坚、不怕风化，是上等的建筑材料。汉白玉是什么岩石呢？它就是大理岩的一种。当大理岩的化学成分纯粹时就是白的，掺有杂质时就有了颜色。大理岩的化学成分和石灰岩一样，就是碳酸钙。说起来，石灰岩还是大理岩的前身。大理岩和火成岩、沉积岩都不同，不是岩浆凝结的，也不是泥沙堆积的，而是从石灰岩变来的。但是石灰岩里没有碳酸钙结晶，在大理岩中碳酸钙则成了细粒结晶。
    什么原因使得石灰岩的内部物质重新结晶呢？这主要是因为高温的作用。压力增加也有影响。哪里来的高温呢？因为岩浆的侵入。当岩浆侵入石灰岩时，在最接近岩浆的地方，不仅受到热力的烘烤，而且还受到岩浆中分离出来的气体、液体的作用。这时就不只是内部组织重新调整了成分也因此发生了变化，变为另外一种新的岩石。
    不仅是石灰岩，其他的一切岩石也都可以因为高温、高压以及新物质的渗入，引起内部组织乃至成分的改变，生成新的岩石。这种变化过程叫做变质作用。新生的岩石叫变质岩。
    在强大的压力作用下，许多变质岩的内部，矿物平行地排列起来看去如条带一般，有的甚至可以一片片劈开，由粘土变来的板岩，就能开成一块块薄的石板。有时岩石内部的矿物也会被挤碎再重新胶结起来。但也有的时候在变质过程中生成了新的矿物，如滑石、云母等，有的还具备美丽的晶形。如北京西山、湖南浏阳都出产的菊花石，就是因为石头在变质作用中产生了红柱石的晶体。这些晶体的外形成簇向四方放射，好像朵朵菊花。
    变质作用中不仅可以生成红柱石之类的矿物，还可以形成重要的矿产。世界最大的苏联库尔斯克铁矿，就是在从砂岩变来的石英岩中找到的。新近在我国江西中部发现的大铁矿，也是出现在变质岩中，此外像铜、钼、钨等矿产也有的是在变质岩中的。其实很多变质岩本身就是矿产，如大理岩、石英岩、片麻岩板岩等。它们都是良好的建筑材料。
    地壳发生造山运动的时候产生了巨大的挤压力。有时这种力也能转化为热，常常造成大面积的变质作用。在发生造山运动时，也往往是岩浆最活跃的时候，所以这些作用都不是孤立的。
