Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 4th. The Chinese People's Delegation, headed by Guo Moruo, accompanied by Korean Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myung-hee, visited the Korean Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition in Pyongyang today.

    The delegation visited the model of the Hwanghae Iron Works blast furnace in the Heavy Industry Hall, which was restored by the Korean people with their own strength. The daily output of pig iron from this blast furnace during the Japanese rule was about 270 tons, but now it can produce 600 to 700 tons, and has created a record of more than 1,000 tons per day. The delegation also watched the process of manufacturing artificial fibers from calcium carbide, which was invented by Korean chemist Academician Li Seung-gi. In the Light Industry Hall, the delegation watched the rayon made from corn stalks.

    In the Agriculture Hall, the delegation visited the high-yield rice ears harvested this year by the Douam Agricultural Cooperative in Gangnam County, which yielded 55 tons of rice per jeongbo (approximately 15 mu). Each ear of rice in this high-yield field had 180 to more than 200 grains.

    The continued recovery and development of Korean industrial and agricultural production after the war left a deep impression on the members of the delegation.

    After the visit, Delegation Leader Guo Moruo wrote a message in the guestbook, wishing the Korean industrial and agricultural production to achieve more brilliant progress.

    中国人民代表团参观朝鲜工农业展览馆
    新华社平壤4日电　以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团今天上午由朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹陪同，在平壤市参观了朝鲜工农业展览馆。
    代表团参观了重工业馆中朝鲜人民用自己的力量恢复起来的黄海制铁所高炉模型。这座高炉在日本统治时期生铁日产量二百七十吨左右，现在已能生产六、七百吨，并且创造了日产一千多吨的纪录。代表团还观看了馆内展出的用电石制造人造纤维的过程，这是朝鲜化学家李升基院士所制造的。在轻工业馆中，代表团观看了用玉蜀黍秸制造的人造丝。
    在农业馆里，代表团参观了江南郡斗岩农业社今年在一町步水田（约合十五市亩）收获五十五吨稻谷的丰产稻穗，这块丰产田上丰产的稻穗每穗结稻粒一百八十粒到二百多粒。
    朝鲜工农业生产在战后的继续恢复发展给代表团团员们留下深刻的印象。
    参观完毕后，郭沫若团长在留言簿上题了字，他祝朝鲜的工农业生产获得更辉煌的进展。
