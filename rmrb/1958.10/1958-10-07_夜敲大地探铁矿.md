　　The prospecting team members returned along the rugged mountain road in the evening.
　　"There's a heavy task that needs to be completed immediately." The team leader was waiting at the entrance of the tent. He then told everyone: "The county party secretary just came and requested the team to find at least one iron ore deposit within twenty hours, otherwise five hundred members of the commune will have to stop work and wait for materials." Although we are engaged in copper prospecting, we have a full responsibility to assist the local area in finding iron. Now the task is heavy, the time is short, and the requirements are high. This is the first time we have encountered this." Can we complete it? Do you have confidence?" After the captain finished speaking, his bright eyes swept over everyone.
　　"Yes!" Everyone answered loudly like thunder: "Guarantee to complete the task, set off immediately! Eat after completing the task!"
　　The sky was studded with a few sparse stars, and the moon had not yet come out. The survey team members crossed the deep valley and "searched" in all directions. The mountains and fields were lit up with flashlights and torches. The sounds of hammers and shouts were mixed together. They were climbing, searching, and almost every stone had to be knocked a few times. No "disguise" could escape their hawk-like eyes.
　　"What good iron!"
　　"What thick ore seams!"
　　People were fascinated by the joy of victory, and they did not expect that they had been fighting hard all night. When they met at Mabei Ridge, the morning glow had already risen in the east.

    夜敲大地探铁矿
    傍晚，勘探队员们踏着崎岖的山路回来了。
    “有个繁重的任务，马上要我们完成。”队长正等在帐篷门口。他接着告诉大家：“县委书记刚刚来过，要求小队帮助在二十小时内至少找到一个铁矿，否则公社社员有五百人得要停工待料。”虽然我们是搞铜的，但我们完全有责任协助地方上找铁。现在任务重、时间短、要求高，这对我们说来，还是头一次碰到。“我们能够完成吗？有信心没有？”队长说完，明亮的眼睛扫着大家。
    “有！”大伙打雷似的大声回答：“保证完成任务，立即出发！完成任务再吃饭！”
    天空嵌着几颗稀星，月亮还没有出来。普查队员们穿过深谷，向东南西北“搜索”。满山遍野亮起了手电、火把。一阵阵的铁锤声和叫喊声混杂在一起。他们在爬着、搜寻着，几乎连每一块石头都要被敲上几下，任何“伪装”，也休想逃过他们山鹰般的眼睛。
    “多好的铁呀！”
    “好厚的矿层哟！”
    人们被胜利的喜悦迷住了，竟没有想到他们已经苦战了一整夜。当他们相会在马背岭时，东方已经升起了彩霞。
