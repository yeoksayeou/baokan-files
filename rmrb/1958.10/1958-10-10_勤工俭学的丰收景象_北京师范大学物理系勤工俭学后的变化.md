    The Bumper Harvest Scene of Diligent Work and Frugal Study
    ——Changes in the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University After Diligent Work-Study
    By Our Correspondent Wei Wenhua
    This reporter recently visited the Physics Department of Beijing Normal University and saw that, like the departments of other brother schools, since the implementation of the Party's educational policy of serving politics and combining education with productive labor, significant changes have taken place in all aspects. The teaching reform has achieved a decisive victory, laboratories have been converted into factory workshops for production, scientific research has become active, close ties have been established with some factories and agricultural cooperatives outside the school, and the relationships between people are also changing.
    Abstract and Concrete
    Physics is inherently an interesting science in the natural sciences, with a profound direct relationship to production. However, in the past, it was mystified by bourgeois experts. Young teachers and students were superstitious about old teachers, and old teachers were superstitious about books and foreigners. They had a formula: "Theory - Experiment - Theory." Only "geniuses who read extensively" could gain "knowledge," and linking theory with practice was considered "vulgar" and "lowering the standards." They lectured in isolation and in a one-sided manner, with "General Physics" focusing solely on phenomena and "Theoretical Physics" focusing only on theory, writing formula after formula on the blackboard, becoming increasingly abstract, so that students didn't understand in class and forgot everything after class. Students who had studied radio in school couldn't repair radios, and those who had taken electrical engineering courses were afraid to replace fuses. Some who became middle school teachers didn't even know how to use instruments.
    All these problems were exposed at once after the implementation of the combination of education and productive labor. These revelations made people keenly aware of the urgent need for a thorough reform of the old teaching methods.
    The professors who had always monopolized teaching proposed the so-called "systematic nature of natural science," arguing that major changes would be a disaster and rapid changes would lead to chaos, and that it was necessary to slowly revise the old textbooks. An astronomy professor even suggested suspending classes next semester if he didn't have lecture notes. However, under the leadership of the Party, the masses were widely mobilized, and through the three-way combination of Party organizations, teachers, and students, further in-depth practical investigations and discussions were conducted. In four weeks, the teaching syllabuses for all twenty courses in the department were compiled and revised, and lecture notes for the major courses have now been written. Who is superior and who is inferior? The facts have already provided an answer. For example, after the reform of the electrical engineering course, the students cultivated now possess both general electrical engineering theoretical knowledge and basic operational skills. The new curriculum replaced radio science with applied electronics, adding the latest content such as semiconductors, television, radar, and automatic control, greatly enriching the learning content. Previously, astronomy emphasized ancient astronomical stories, and even calculations of star ephemerides and solar and lunar eclipses were not included in modern astronomy. In addition to these contents, the new textbook also includes the latest scientific achievements such as the calculation of artificial satellite ephemerides. Solid-state objects and the philosophy of physics, which were not previously available, are now separate courses, and young teachers and students are working together to write the textbooks. The new curriculum combines the previously separated general physics and theoretical physics, explaining theory from practice and closely integrating theory with productive practice, becoming "Practice - Theory - Practice," thus transforming a science that once seemed like metaphysics into a solid and brand-new science. Due to the elimination of a large amount of repetition and errors, the teaching time has been reduced by 30% in the physics and mathematics sections alone.
    Incomparable Ratios
    During the teaching reform, because productive labor became a practical need, the doors of the laboratories were opened, and the instrumental equipment was used to run factories. Together with the original affiliated factory, the entire department established nine factories and workshops for production. Teachers and students also established fixed ties with fourteen factories and agricultural cooperatives outside the school, taking turns to participate in labor and technical revolution. At the same time, combined with the characteristics of teacher training, they established fourteen satellite schools in these units, including literacy classes, primary schools, middle schools, and universities. Students acted as both apprentices and teachers. By participating in productive labor both on and off campus, and coming into contact with reality, more problems were discovered, and scientific research arose accordingly.
    In the past, this school's physics department also engaged in scientific research, but because some people had rendered this science so profound and unfathomable, it was simply sacrosanct. Young teachers and students were afraid to inquire due to superstition and inferiority complex. The selection of topics had to be approved by professors, but it was never approved. The entire department, with only seven professors and associate professors, proposed eight topics in four years, but only completed two.
    When the masses rose up and wanted to engage in scientific research, some professors were skeptical, some were waiting and seeing, and some directly stated: "I don't believe you can do it!" However, the masses dared to think and dared to act, disregarding the "accountant faction's" "predictions," and under the leadership of the Party, they fiercely attacked the scientific fortress using the three-way combination method. In the month from the end of August to the end of September, the entire department completed a total of 415 projects, some of which reached or exceeded international standards. The ratio of this to the past, when a few bourgeois experts monopolized scientific research, is not easy to calculate at once. An optics professor had been researching "combined scattering" for three years without success, but recently young teachers and students participated in the research and succeeded in two days. Young teachers and students, empty-handed, made a home-made electrostatic accelerator that could produce one million electron volts of energy, a hydrogen liquefaction machine, a high-frequency leak detector, and a twelve-tube all-wave radio that could receive signals from artificial satellites. The young teachers and students of the astronomy group, enduring the professor's sarcasm, used self-made cameras and local methods to complete sunspot and monochromatic light photography, taking pictures of stars, all of which reached international standards, leaving the "accountant faction" dumbfounded. What else could they calculate?
    In scientific research, this is a struggle between two roads and two methods, and who is superior and who is inferior has been clearly demonstrated. Bourgeois experts looked for topics that others had not mentioned in the gaps of foreign newspapers and magazines, rarely or never linking them with reality. They also wanted to exclusively enjoy the results and did not allow others to intervene. They even refused to easily let others access laboratory data, so nothing was accomplished. Some people couldn't even decide on a topic and used the empty signboard of "expert" to intimidate others. Now, the Party leads scientific research, the masses find topics from rich production practice, and topics come endlessly. The great leap forward in science this month was originally expected to include more than 100 projects, but the number was revised and increased several times, and finally more than 400 projects were completed. In research, we also boldly followed the mass line, opened the doors of the laboratory, and went deep into the masses and into reality. Therefore, the research work advanced rapidly beyond the expectations of all the "accountant factions." When the young teachers and students of the astronomy group went into practice, the old professor pointed and said: "Astronomy is in the sky, you can't find it on the ground." But the young teachers and students visited old farmers and cart drivers in the countryside, gained a lot of knowledge, and used this to write a special practical lecture note on identifying stars.
    Unstoppable Classrooms
    The courses are all related to production, the department has established factories, and has established close ties with factories and agricultural cooperatives outside the school. People have tasted the first fruits in production practice, and now productive labor has become an inseparable part of teaching life. According to the requirements and possibilities of the masses, the new school system is stipulated as "1-3.7-7.3," that is, one month of vacation, 3.7 months of labor, and 7.3 months of classes each year. According to the comrades of the department's general Party branch: Students who study at the school for four years, in addition to having higher theoretical knowledge than in the past, must have at least a Grade 1 level in six technical aspects such as metal, wood, fitter, and forging, and one of them must reach a Grade 3 level. They must also understand factory management, economic accounting, and purchasing and sales relationships, which were not included in the past teaching. Combined with the characteristics of teacher training, running satellite schools outside the school, students could only teach one physics course half-baked after graduation in the past. Now they have to learn to teach several courses, and also learn to manage school administration, and carry out political and ideological propaganda work for the Party, so as to truly cultivate "all-rounders." Now students have four identities in school: students, laborers, scientific researchers, and Party propagandists. After graduation, they can be teachers of several subjects, can also undertake school administrative work, can also work, can do research work, and can manage factories.
    Students participate in production, scientific research, and school activities. There are many problems that arise on the spot, some of which they encounter themselves, some of which are raised by workers and peasants, and many of which are not in books, all of which require immediate solutions. The reporter saw that most of the teachers and students are together, operating in productive labor and scientific research while discussing and explaining, and the students understand everything after they have finished. This kind of on-site teaching is lively and effective. Although it is only the beginning, it is very popular among students. Through this teaching method, some courses can be taught less or not at all. For example, the original "craft internship" was purely formalism, and has now been completely replaced by a more content-rich productive labor course. The original "educational internship" was only for six weeks in the fourth grade, but apart from preparation time, there were only a few hours of actual lecturing. Now, through running satellite schools, more than 100 hours of lectures can be given in four years. This course has now been cancelled. Students have created rich teaching experience in running schools, and the original formalistic "teaching method" is no longer established. As for other courses, they are all further improved through on-site teaching in productive labor. The emergence of on-site teaching has enabled school education to break through the framework of classroom teaching and greatly expand the scope of teaching. This determines further improvement of the school system, increasing labor practice time, and implementing a five-year work-study program to reach graduate level.
    Students participate in the technical revolution in production, scientific research, and in contact with factories and agricultural cooperatives. On the one hand, they learn creatively, and on the other hand, it is also the most practical comprehensive review of what they have learned in the classroom, which they remember firmly. Therefore, the examination system has also become a problem. The Party's general branch of the physics department has, according to the requirements of the masses and adapting to the new situation, changed the rigid examination system of memorizing formulas and articles in the past into a creative and flexible examination, that is, during each semester, a "creative learning movement" is launched within a certain period of time, and the new products, inventions, and research papers proposed by individuals or groups are identified through mass debate as the main form of examination. Those who cannot come up with creative inventions and new products will be given written and oral examinations, which are supplementary. This examination method ensures that one or several scientific research climaxes are launched every semester, making teaching more lively and vigorous.
    Through this teaching, the relationship between teachers and students has become closer. It is no longer a feudal and cold "teacher-student" relationship, but a loving relationship between teachers and students as comrades, and also as equal laborers. Teachers can no longer "teach books without teaching people." They must also have four identities: teachers, laborers, scientific researchers, and social activists. They must be with students frequently, understand students from productive labor, and guide students.
    Greatly Skilled
    The Physics Department of Beijing Normal University is one of many educational units in China. It is a microcosm of China's new socialist education. Here, it is now a learning unit, a production unit, and a scientific research unit. From the perspective of participating in off-campus school-running and industrial and agricultural technology revolution, it is also a political activity unit. Students and teachers are no longer simply a matter of you teaching me learning. The activities of the department have added many new contents, all of which are going very well. Whose achievements are these?
    Bourgeois "experts" have always proclaimed themselves to be "skilled," but after years of education, a lively and vibrant discipline has been "led" to a state of near death. They regard the Communist Party as "laymen," but the Party has led this science to become hot and lively, resurrected from the dead, and found a way out of a dead end.
    After breaking the "mystery" and "superstition," liberating the mind, the Party boldly led, and raised the red flag high. The secretary of the Party's general branch also served as the director of the department, and the Party's branches and groups were scattered in all aspects, playing a fighting role. In natural science, politics also exerts unparalleled power. In teaching and scientific research, wherever there is a problem, the Party leads the masses to study the problem through "abstract discussions," mobilize the masses to find the causes, offer suggestions, criticize all kinds of remaining superstitious ideas, overcome individual efforts and competition for cutting-edge technology, and localism, and conduct experiments day and night with the masses to achieve victory. In the selenium photocell workshop, after 55 failures, a photocell that exceeded the British level was finally produced. The Party organization of the astronomy group, regardless of the "expert's" ridicule and intimidation, led the masses to persevere in hundreds of experiments using local methods, and finally used self-made local cameras to take sunspot photos and star photos that caught up with the American level. Using the method of political "abstract discussion" to teach and conduct scientific research is actually the budding of a new type of communist teaching.
    The Party constantly educates the masses to promote collectivist thinking. The phenomena of mutual secrecy and competition for results in the past have now disappeared. Many people and units are able to put the collective interest first, sacrifice themselves for others, put down their own work to unconditionally help others, and improve and advance together.
    In teaching reform, running factories, scientific research, and going to factories and the countryside, the Party's red flag can be seen flying in front at any time, moving from one victory to another! Bourgeois experts can't even catch up!
    Who is skilled? The Communist Party is skilled, and greatly skilled! Who is a layman? The bourgeoisie is a layman, a true layman! The contrast between the facts before and after here has provided an answer for the "accountant faction."

    勤工俭学的丰收景象
    ——北京师范大学物理系勤工俭学后的变化
    本报记者　魏文华
    记者最近访问了北京师范大学物理系，看到：这里和其它兄弟学校的系科一样，自从贯彻党的教育为政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育工作方针以来，各方面都在发生着重大的变化。教学改革已取得了决定性的胜利，实验室改成工厂车间后进行生产了，科学研究活跃起来了，和校外一些工厂、农业社建起密切的联系，人和人的关系也在变化了。
    玄与实
    物理学本是自然科学中一门饶有趣味的科学，对于生产具有深切的直接的关系。但过去，它被资产阶级专家搞得神秘化了。青年教师和学生迷信老教师，老教师又迷信书本和外国人，他们有一个公式，就是“理论——实验——理论”，只有“天才饱读书卷”才能得到“知识”，联系实际是“庸俗”、“降低水平”。他们孤立片面地讲课，“普通物理”专讲现象，“理论物理”只讲理论，一黑板一黑板地写公式，越讲越玄，学生上课不懂，下课忘光。学生在学校学过无线电不会修理收音机，学过电工课不敢接保险丝，到中学当教师，有的人连仪器都不会使。
    所有这些问题，在实行教育与生产劳动相结合以后，一齐都暴露出来了。这些都使人们猛省，迫切要求来一次对旧教学的彻底改革。
    一向包揽教学的教授们，提出所谓“自然科学系统性”，认为大改会糟，快改会乱，只要把旧教材糊糊补补，要慢慢来。天文组有位教授甚至提出没有讲义，下学期就把课停一下。但在党的领导下，群众广泛发动，通过党组织、教师、学生三结合的办法，进一步深入实际调查研究，进行讨论，四个星期就把全系二十门课的教学大纲编成并修改好，现在主要课程的讲义已经写好了。到底是谁高谁低？事实已有答案。如电工课经过改革后，培养出来的学生既具有一般电工理论知识，又具有基本操作技术。新课程把无线电学改为应用电子学，内容增加了最新的半导体、电视、雷达和自动控制等，大大丰富了学习内容。原来天文学强调古代天文故事，对现代的天文科学连星历表计算、日月食等都未列入，新教材除增加这些内容以外还有最新科学成果人造卫星星历表计算等。过去没有的固体物体、物理学的哲学等，现在都单独设科，由青年教师和学生们集体努力把教材写好。新课把过去被割裂开的普通物理和理论物理，重新结合在一起，从实际中讲理论，讲理论密切结合生产实践，成为“实践——理论——实践”，这样就使一门原来形似玄学的科学，改变成为踏踏实实崭新的科学。教学时间，由于去掉大量重复、讹误，单是物理和数学两部分即精简了30％的学时。
    难比的比例
    教学改革当中，由于生产劳动成为实际的需要，实验室的门打开了，利用仪器设备来办工厂，连同原有的一个附属工厂在内，全系办成九个工厂、车间，进行生产。师生们又和校外的十四个工厂、农业社建立固定联系，轮流去参加劳动和技术革命，同时又结合师范本身特点在这些单位办起十四所包括扫盲班、小学、中学、大学在内的卫星学校，学生们当学徒又当先生。在校内、校外参加生产劳动，接触实际，发现了更多的问题，因而科学研究也应运而起了。
    这个学校的物理系，过去也搞科学研究，但因有人把这门科学煊弄成高深莫测，简直神圣不可侵犯，青年教师和学生因迷信而自卑，一向不敢问津，选题要由教授批准，但从未被批准过。全系只有七个教授、副教授，四年来订了八个题目，但只完成两个。
    当群众起来，要搞科学研究，教授们有的怀疑，有的观望，有的直接了当地提出：“你们能搞成，我就不信！”但群众既敢想也敢干，不顾“算账派”的“预言”，在党的领导下以三结合的办法，向科学堡垒猛攻，在8月底到9月底的一个月中，全系总共完成四百一十五个项目，有一些达到或超过国际水平。这和过去少数资产阶级专家包办科学研究，比例是不容易一下子算好的。有一位光学教授过去研究“联合散射”，三年未成，最近青年教师和学生参加研究两天就告成功了。青年教师和学生赤手空拳，制成了能产一百万电子伏特能量的土静电加速器，制成了氢气液化机，高频探漏器，还制成了能收听人造卫星讯号的十二个灯的全波收音机，天文组的青年教师和学生们忍住教授讽刺，用自制的土照像机和土办法，完成了太阳黑子和单色光摄影，拍下了恒星照片，质量都达到国际水平，使“算账派”目瞪口呆，他们还能算出个什么名堂来呢？
    在科学研究中，这是两条道路、两种方法的斗争，谁优谁劣得到明证。资产阶级专家从外国的报刊夹缝中找别人没有提到的题目，很少或根本不联系实际，又要一个人独享成果，不许别人插手，甚至实验室资料也不轻易让人接触，所以一事不成，有些人连个题目也订不出来，背着“专家”的空招牌吓人。而现在党领导科学研究，是群众从丰富的生产实践中找题目，题目源源而来，这一个月的科学大跃进本来预计一百多项，后来几次修改增加，最后完成了四百多项；在研究中又放胆走群众路线，打开实验室大门，深入群众深入实际，因此，研究工作便超过一切“算账派”的预料而飞快地前进。天文组的青年教师和学生到实际中去的时候，老教授指着说：“天文在天上，地上找不到”，但青年教师和学生在农村访问老农、马车夫，获得许多知识，还以此写出一本专门的有关识别星星的实习讲义。
    关不住的课堂
    课程都联系生产，系里办起了工厂，又和校外工厂、农业社建立了水乳交融的联系，人们在生产实际中初尝甜果，现在生产劳动已成为教学生活中不可分割的一部分了。根据群众要求和可能，新的学制规定为“1—3.7—7.3”，即每年放假一个月，劳动3.7个月，上课7.3个月。据系党总支的同志说：学生在学校学习四年，除具有比过去更高的理论知识外，在技术方面对金、木、钳、锻等六个工种都要起码具有一级工水平，其中有一种要达到三级工水平，还要懂得工厂管理、经济核算、购销关系等，这些都是过去教学所没有的。结合师范的特点，在校外办卫星学校，过去学生毕业只能半生不熟地教一门物理课，现在要学着教几门课，还要学会管理学校行政，为党进行政治思想宣传工作等，这样真正地培养“多面手”。现在学生在学校具有四种身份：学生、劳动者、科学研究人员、党的宣传员，毕业后能当几科的教员，又能担任学校行政工作，也能劳动，能做研究工作，能管理工厂。
    学生参加生产、科学研究和办学等活动，在现场中出现的问题特别多，有的是自己碰到的，有的是工人农民提出来的，很多是书本所没有的，都要求当场解决。记者看到，在这里多数教师和学生一起，在生产劳动和科学研究中一边操作，一边通过讨论讲解，学生做完了也全部领会了，这种现场教学生动而有效，现在虽然只是开始，但大受学生欢迎。通过这种教学办法，有些课就可以少讲或不讲。像原来的“工艺实习”，纯粹是形式主义的，现在已全部被内容更为丰富的生产劳动课所代替；原来“教育实习”，只在四年级有六个星期，但除了准备时间，实际讲课只有几个小时，现在通过办卫星学校，四年中可讲课一百多小时，这一门课现在已取消了；学生在办学中自己创造了丰富的教学经验，原来形式主义的“教学法”也不再设立了。至于其它课，也都是在生产劳动中通过现场教学，进一步改进。现场教学的出现，使学校教育冲破了课堂教学的框框，把教学范围大大地扩展了，这样就决定进一步改进学制，增加劳动实践时间，实行五年制半工半读达到研究生水平。
    学生在生产、科学研究以及在和工厂、农业社联系中参加技术革命，一方面创造性地学习，一方面对课堂所学到的东西也是最实际的综合性的复习，牢记不忘，因此考试制度也成了问题。物理系党总支已根据群众要求，适应新的情况，把过去死板板背公式条文的死考试制度，改为创造性的活的考试，即在每一学期当中在一定时期内开展一个“创造性学习运动”，把个人或小组集体提出的新产品、发明以及研究论文等，通过群众辩论来鉴定，作为主要考试形式，对提不出创造发明和新产品的人才举行笔试和口试，这是辅助的。这种考试办法，保证每一学期掀起一个或几个科学研究高潮，使教学更加生动活泼。
    通过这种教学，教师和学生之间的关系密切起来了，不再是封建的冷落的“师生”关系，而既是师生又是同志的友爱关系，也是平等的劳动者。教师不能再“教书不教人”，他们也要具备四种身份：先生、劳动者、科学研究人员、社会活动家，他们要和学生经常在一起，从生产劳动中了解学生，指导学生。
    大大的内行
    北京师范大学物理系，是我国许多教育单位中的一个，这里是我国社会主义新教育的缩影。在这里，现在既是学习单位，又是生产单位，也是科学研究单位，从参加校外办学和工农业技术革命的意义上说也是政治活动单位。学生和教师，都已不单纯是你教我学这样的简单了，系的活动增加了许多新的内容，都进行得很好。这是什么人的成绩呢？
    资产阶级“专家”一向以“内行”自封，但他们搞了多少年教育，一门生动活泼的学科被“领导”成奄奄一息。他们视共产党为“外行”，但党把这门科学领导得热气腾腾，从死中复活，绝路逢生。
    打破了“神秘”和“迷信”后，解放了思想，党大胆领导起来，高高地举起了红旗。党的总支书记兼任了系主任，党的支部、小组散布在各个方面，发挥战斗作用。在自然科学中，政治同样发挥出无比的威力。在教学和科学研究中那里有问题，就由党领导群众通过“务虚”来研究问题所在，发动群众来找原因，献计策，批判各种各样残存的迷信思想，克服单干以及争尖端、本位主义等，和群众一起日日夜夜地进行试验获得胜利。在硒光电池车间经过五十五次失败，终于制出超过英国水平的光电池。天文组的党组织，不顾“专家”的嘲笑威吓，领导群众用土办法坚持上百次的试验，终于用自制的土照相机拍摄出赶上美国水平的太阳黑子照片和恒星照片。用政治“务虚”的办法来教学并进行科学研究，实际上是共产主义新型教学的萌芽。
    党不断教育群众发扬集体主义思想，过去互相保密、互相争成果的现象现在消失了，有许多人和单位能够按照集体利益，舍己为人，放下自己的工作去无条件地帮助别人，共同提高，共同前进。
    在教学改革、办工厂、科学研究、下厂下乡等活动中，任何时候都能看见党的红旗在前面飘扬，从一个胜利走向一个胜利！资产阶级专家望尘莫及！
    谁是内行？共产党是内行，是大大的内行！谁是外行？资产阶级才是外行，是真正的外行！这里前后事实的对比，已为“算账派”作出了答案。
