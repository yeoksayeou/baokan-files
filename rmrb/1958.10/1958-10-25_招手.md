　　Waving
　　Zhu Wenyuan

　　As our Chinese People's Volunteer Army's train headed home, the deepest impression along the way was: everywhere the train passed, people were waving. There were the deeply wrinkled hands of *Amani* (Grandma); the tender hands of children on the backs of *Azhimani* (Sister-in-law); farmers who laid down their hoes in the fields to wave to us; girls who raised blooming azaleas to wave to us; railway workers who, after signaling, raised red and green flags to wave to us; and so on. When the train passed through Wonsan Station, in a room by the roadside, a female worker pulled up the curtain with one hand and waved a white handkerchief with the other. When the train passed through the mountains and forests, on distant mountaintops, those blurry figures also waved their hands. No matter on the roadside, in the square, under the eaves, at the window, or in places that flashed by on the speeding train and were difficult for me to see clearly in an instant, countless people were waving to us.

　　Especially the children, waving to us, jumping! Until the train went very far away...so far that they could no longer be seen, they were still waving. Near Limuli Station, a group of elementary school students stood neatly on a small hill, raising their red scarves to wave to us. At Pyonggang Station, a little girl who had just learned to walk, tottering as she walked, also waved to us. Her mother even taught her to shout "Goodbye!" That voice was so tender, so affectionate, and so reluctant to leave!

　　I thought to myself: why do these children, who don't even understand, know to wave to us to express their farewell? They were all born after the ceasefire, they have never seen ferocious enemies, never heard the sound of bombs, and have never personally experienced the combat friendship forged by the blood of the Volunteer Army and the Korean people. Why do they love the Volunteer Army so much? ...Yes, they learned about the Volunteer Army from their mother's eyes, from the stories told by *Amani* and *Abaji* in the evenings, from the teacher's lectures...From the day they had memories, children knew the names of Luo Shengjiao, Huang Jiguang, Yang Gensi... These are the source of their love for the Volunteer Army, and they make the combat friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people last forever...

    招手
    朱文远
    当我们志愿军归国的火车开动时，一路上给我们印象最深的是：列车过处，到处都在招手。有阿妈尼（大妈）皱纹深深的手；有背在阿芝妈尼（大嫂）背上孩子们细嫩的手；有正在田间耕作的农民放下了锄头向我们招手；有姑娘们举起盛开的金达莱向我们招手；有铁路工人打完了信号，举起红绿旗向我们招手；有……。列车过元山车站时，路边一间屋里，有一个女工一手拉起窗帘，一手扬起白手帕向我们招手；列车穿过山林时，在很远很远的山头上，那些看得模糊不清的人影也向我们摇晃着手；不管在路边、在广场上、在屋檐下、在窗口、在飞驰的列车一闪即逝、使我瞬间难以看清楚的地方，都有无数的人向我们招手。
    特别是孩子们，向我们招手啊，跳呀！直到列车走得很远很远……远得看不清了还在招手。在黎木里车站旁边，一群小学生整齐地站在一个小山岗上，扬起红领巾向我们招手。在平康车站上，一个刚会走路的小女孩，走起路来摇摇晃晃，也向我们招手。她妈妈还教她向我们喊：“再见！”那声音多么柔嫩，多么亲昵，而又多么使人不忍离去啊！
    我这样想着：为什么这些还不懂事的孩子们也知道向我们招手表示欢送呢？他们都是停战后才出生的，他们没有见过凶恶的敌人，没有听过炸弹的响声，也没有亲身体会过志愿军和朝鲜人民以鲜血结成的战斗友谊，他们为什么会这样热爱志愿军呢？……是的，他们是从母亲的眼睛里、从阿妈尼和阿爸基傍晚讲的故事里、从老师的讲课中……认识了志愿军的。孩子们从有记忆那一天起，就知道了罗盛教、黄继光、杨根思……这些英雄的名字。这就是他们热爱志愿军的来源，并使中朝人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊永远永远地延绵不绝……。
