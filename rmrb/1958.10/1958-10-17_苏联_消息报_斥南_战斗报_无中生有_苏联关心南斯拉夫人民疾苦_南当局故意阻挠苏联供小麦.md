Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. TASS reports from Moscow on the 16th: "Izvestia" published an observer's commentary refuting an article published in the Yugoslav "Borba" on August 24th. This article groundlessly insisted that the Soviet Union refused to supply Yugoslavia with wheat. The observer pointed out that the facts show that the real responsibility for the delayed supply of Soviet wheat to Yugoslavia lies entirely with the Yugoslav side. From November 1957 to August 1958, the Yugoslav side did not express any desire to purchase Soviet wheat, and its relevant agencies never mentioned that it was willing to sign a commercial contract to purchase wheat.

All of this hindered the supply of wheat from the 1957 harvest, and the part of the 1958 harvest used for export had not yet been allocated. However, instead of continuing business negotiations with the relevant Soviet agencies on the issue of supplying wheat from the 1958 harvest, Belgrade engaged in speculative propaganda attacks in the newspapers. The Yugoslav side transferred the issue of Soviet wheat supply from the scope of business negotiations to the realm of unfounded fabrications and conjectures by ill-intentioned journalists.

The "Izvestia" observer wrote that some people in Belgrade have been clamoring about the so-called Soviet refusal to supply Yugoslavia with wheat in 1958. They are obviously hoping that such tricks will stir up anti-Soviet sentiment among the Yugoslav people. Now, the slanderers have been exposed. Yugoslav officials have publicly announced that the Soviet Union will supply Yugoslavia with wheat, and Yugoslavia has sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate the supply of wheat. At this time, the Yugoslav newspapers have to remain silent and conceal the truth from the Yugoslav people.

The commentary emphasized that the Soviet people, who are genuinely concerned about the Yugoslav people, deeply sympathize with the difficulties of the Yugoslav residents. Only unconscionable slanderers would distort the facts. Those readers who have been misled by ill intentions on the issue of Soviet wheat supply to Yugoslavia should have the opportunity to understand the truth of the matter.

    苏联“消息报”斥南“战斗报”无中生有
    苏联关心南斯拉夫人民疾苦
    南当局故意阻挠苏联供小麦
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：“消息报”刊载了观察家的一篇评论，驳斥南斯拉夫“战斗报”8月24日刊载的一篇文章，这篇文章无中生有地硬说苏联拒绝供给南斯拉夫小麦。观察家指出，事实表明，苏联小麦迟迟未能供给南斯拉夫的真正责任完全在南斯拉夫方面。从1957年11月到1958年8月，南斯拉夫方面丝毫没有表示希望购买苏联小麦，而它的有关机构根本只字未提它愿意签订购买小麦的商业合同。
    所有这一切障碍了从1957年的收成中供给小麦，而1958年的收成中还没有拨出用来出口的部分。但是，贝尔格莱德不但不继续同有关的苏联机构就供给1958年收获的小麦问题进行商务谈判，反而在报刊上进行投机性的宣传攻击。南斯拉夫方面把关于苏联供给小麦的问题从商务谈判的范围转到不怀好意的记者们的凭空捏造和臆断的范围。
    “消息报”观察家写道，贝尔格莱德的一些人围绕着所谓苏联1958年拒绝供给南斯拉夫小麦的问题大肆叫嚷，他们显然指望这样一类花招会在南斯拉夫人民中间挑起敌视苏联的情绪。现在，诬蔑者原形毕露了，南斯拉夫官方人士已经公开宣布苏联将供给南斯拉夫小麦，而南斯拉夫已派代表团到莫斯科来谈判供应小麦的问题，在这个时候，南斯拉夫报纸只好哑口无言，只好向南斯拉夫人民掩饰真相了。
    评论强调说，对南斯拉夫人民真正关心的苏联人对南斯拉夫居民的困难深深同情，只有丧失良心的诬蔑者才会颠倒黑白。应当让那些曾在苏联供给南斯拉夫小麦问题上被人不怀好意地引入歧途的读者们有可能了解事情的真相。
