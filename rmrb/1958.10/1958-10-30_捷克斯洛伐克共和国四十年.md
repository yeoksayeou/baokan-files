Forty years of the Czechoslovak Republic

October 28th marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic, a day of celebration for the restoration of national independence for the Czech and Slovak peoples.

Historically, the Czech and Slovak nations suffered long-term cruel oppression and exploitation by foreign races. In the early 17th century, the Czech lands were ruled by the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; Slovakia lost its political independence as early as the 14th century. However, for centuries, the Czech and Slovak peoples steadfastly fought against foreign oppressors.

In the latter half of the 19th century, the Czech lands became a major industrial center of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The ranks of the proletariat and the forces of the bourgeoisie developed. Especially under the influence of the victory of the October Revolution, the struggle of the Czech and Slovak peoples against the Habsburg dynasty and for national liberation flourished. On May 1st and October 14th, 1918, countless working masses in the Czech and Slovak lands held mass demonstrations under the slogan of "Struggle for a Socialist State."

However, the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie, with the support of the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, usurped the power of the newly born republic and implemented a policy of suppressing the working people domestically and relying on Western imperialism externally. In 1938, they even accepted the infamous "Munich Agreement" and were eventually occupied by Hitler's Germany. It was not until May 1945, when the Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, launched an uprising and received the help of the Soviet Red Army, that they achieved victory in liberating the whole country. Only after the Czechoslovak people defeated foreign aggressors and the domestic bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore the old order did they consolidate and expand the people's democratic power led by the working class and begin to rapidly move towards the road of building socialism.

    捷克斯洛伐克共和国四十年
    10月28日，是捷克斯洛伐克共和国建国四十周年纪念日，是捷克和斯洛伐克恢复民族独立的节日。
    捷克和斯洛伐克民族在历史上曾经长期遭受着异族的残酷压迫和剥削。十七世纪初叶，捷克就被奥匈帝国的哈布斯堡王朝统治；而斯洛伐克则远在十四世纪就丧失了政治独立。但是，捷克和斯洛伐克人民几世纪以来始终坚定不移地同外族压迫者进行斗争。
    在十九世纪后半期，捷克成了奥匈帝国主要工业中心。无产阶级队伍和资产阶级势力都有了发展。特别是在十月革命胜利的影响下，捷克和斯洛伐克人民反对哈布斯堡王朝和争取民族解放的斗争蓬勃展开了。1918年5月1日和10月14日，捷克和斯洛伐克无数劳动群众就是在“为社会主义国家而奋斗”的口号下举行群众示威的。
    但是捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级在社会民主党右翼领导支持下篡夺了新生的共和国政权，并且实行了对内镇压劳动人民、对外投靠西方帝国主义的政策，1938年还接受了臭名远扬的“慕尼黑协定”并终于遭到希特勒德国的占领。直到1945年5月，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷共领导下举行起义并得到苏联红军的帮助才取得解放全国的胜利。捷克斯洛伐克人民战胜外国侵略者和国内资产阶级复辟的阴谋以后，才巩固和扩大了以工人阶级为首的人民民主政权，开始向建设社会主义的道路迅速迈进。（白）
