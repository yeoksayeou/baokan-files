    Poems and Paintings Adorn the Walls, Songs Fill the Fields:
    Cultural Boom in Siji Township, Chaoxian County
    (By Our Correspondent Yu Ming) Siji Township in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, has raised a bright red banner in the widespread popularization and great revolution of rural culture. Of the township's 21,000+ people, over 11,000 have created poetry, totaling 250,000 poems from April to the present; over 15,000 have participated in the singing movement; and in just a few months, over 220,000 poems and paintings have appeared on the walls.

    The mass-run cultural undertakings and mass amateur cultural organizations in Siji Township include film projection teams, libraries, broadcasting stations, people-run primary and secondary schools, Red and Expert schools, exhibition halls, Michurin groups, newspaper reading groups, cultural centers, clubs, literary creation groups, performing arts troupes, dance teams, folk song choirs, men's and women's basketball teams, totaling over 600 organizations; and over 700 Leap Forward Gates, Leap Forward Fields, road reports, blackboards, field mobilization stations, and mobilization placards. The township has eight types of mimeographed small newspapers and nine types of literary publications. This fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of the working class in developing cultural undertakings.

    The cultural activities of the masses in Siji Township are completely integrated with politics and production. The masses create poems and songs based on what they are doing and sing about what they are doing. In order to promote central tasks and conduct political and ideological education among the masses, cadres collectively create poems during cadre meetings as a means of motivation; when inspecting work in the fields and discovering problems, they also compose poems and songs to educate and motivate the masses. Xu Shouqin, the township party secretary, has created over 160 poems this year by combining them with politics and production. In production, the masses create poems sentence by sentence based on their feelings and sing them out loud.

    The poetry creation of the masses in Siji Township fully demonstrates the wisdom of the working people. They not only create a lot but also create well. Many poems are full of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. Gao Wenhua, a newly literate commune director, created the following poem during the drought resistance: "The Milky Way stretches ten thousand miles across the sky, the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl are on opposite sides, let's draw all the water from the Milky Way, so men can farm and women can weave together forever."

    The cultural activities of the masses in Siji Township have boosted their morale, enabling summer crops to increase by more than 60% despite 100 days without rain this year. Last year, the yield was only over 480 jin per mu, but this year it is expected to reach 1,100 jin.

    The leadership of the Siji Township Party Committee puts politics in command in both production and culture. The secretary takes the lead and mobilizes the masses, demonstrating leadership skills, so that the masses of Siji Township not only occupy the leading position in production but also firmly occupy the cultural front.

    诗画满墙　歌声遍野
    巢县司集乡文化大普及
    本报讯　记者于明报道：安徽省巢县司集乡，在农村文化大普及、文化大革命中，举起了一面鲜明的红旗。这个乡二万一千多人，有一万一千多人创作了诗歌，从4月到目前已创作了二十五万首；有一万五千多人参加了歌唱运动；在几个月内，墙头出现二十二万多首诗画。
    司集乡群众自办的文化事业和群众业余文化组织，有电影队、图书馆、广播站、民办中小学、红专学校、展览馆、米丘林小组、读报组、文化馆站、俱乐部、文艺创作组、文工团、舞蹈队、民歌合唱队、男女篮球队等达六百多个，有跃进门、跃进场、道路报、黑板报、田间鼓动站、鼓动牌等七百多个。全乡光是油印小报便有八种，文艺刊物便有九种。这充分表现了工农群众发展文化事业的积极性。
    司集乡群众的文化活动，完全和政治、生产密切结合。群众的诗歌创作和歌唱活动，是做什么就创作什么，做什么就唱什么。干部为了推动中心工作，向群众进行政治思想教育，在开干部会时便集体创作诗歌，作为鼓动工具；在田间检查工作，发现问题，也作诗作歌教育群众，鼓动群众，乡党委书记徐守勤这样结合政治、生产创作，今年已作诗歌一百六十多首。群众在生产中，偶有所感，便你一句我一句地创作起来，又随口唱出来。
    司集乡群众的诗歌创作，充分表现了劳动人民的智慧。他们不但创作得多，而且创作得好，许多诗歌都充满了革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义的色彩。一个刚刚脱盲的社主任高文华，在抗旱中创作了这样的诗歌：“天上银河万里长，牛郎织女各一方，车尽天上银河水，男耕女织永成双。”
    司集乡群众的文化活动，使群众的精神振奋，在今年百日无雨的情况下，仍使夏收作物增产60％以上，去年每亩只收四百八十多斤，今年预计可达一千一百斤。
    司集乡党委的领导，在生产、文化上都政治挂帅，书记亲自动手，发动群众，发挥了领导艺术，使司集乡的群众不但在生产上占了上游，而且牢牢地占领了文化阵地。（附图片）
