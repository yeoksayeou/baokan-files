In early September, Jiangxi Province's daily pig iron production was only a little over 100 tons, but on September 29th it rose to 5,005 tons, and now it has doubled again. In this high-yield assault campaign, leading areas such as the Ji'an Special District continued to lead, and lagging areas such as the Fuzhou Special District also caught up, exceeding the thousand-ton mark.

After the "satellite" of 10,000 tons of daily production was launched, various parts of the province are organizing normal high production on this basis and preparing to welcome the province's Iron and Steel High-Yield Leap Forward Week from the 15th to the 21st. At present, all localities are continuing to strengthen political and ideological work, further mobilize the masses, and consolidate the labor enthusiasm of the masses; vigorously organize the production of ore and fuel, open more small coal mines, promote coal-coke iron smelting, and reserve at least two months of fuel; vigorously promote the methods of焖 iron (smothered iron) and罐子 (jar) iron smelting, the indigenous furnaces must heat the blast to guarantee the furnace through the winter; improve labor organization, strengthen labor management, and organize a portion of the labor force to stay and engage in iron and steel production.

    江西跃为生铁万吨省
    新华社南昌12日电　江西省在10月10日出产了生铁一万零二十二点六吨，进入了全国生铁万吨省的行列。9月初江西省生铁日产量仅一百零几吨，9月29日上升到五千零五吨，现在又翻了一番。在这个高产突击日的战役中，领先的地区如吉安专区继续领先，落后的地区如抚州专区也赶了上来，超过了千吨关。
    在日产万吨“卫星”放出以后，省内各地正在这个基础上，组织正常高产，并准备迎接全省15日至21日的钢铁高产跃进周。现在各地正在继续加强政治思想工作，进一步发动群众，巩固群众的劳动热情；大力组织矿石、燃料生产，多开小煤窑，推广煤焦炼铁，至少储备两个月的燃料；大力推广焖铁和罐子炼铁的办法，土炉要加热风，保证炉子过冬；改善劳动组织，加强劳动管理，组织一部分劳动力留下来搞钢铁生产。
