Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: Conakry dispatch: The Guinean Parliament held a meeting on October 2nd, formally declaring the independence of Guinea and designating this new African nation as the "Republic of Guinea."

The Guinean Parliament was originally the territorial assembly of French Guinea (formerly translated as the Consultative Conference). Today, this parliament announced that it itself would become the constituent assembly drafting the constitution of the Republic of Guinea.

The old Guinean government submitted its resignation to the parliament, and the parliament naturally authorized former Prime Minister Sékou Touré to organize the new government. The new government has eleven members. In addition to serving as Prime Minister, Touré will also be in charge of foreign affairs and defense. The parliament decided to grant the new government full powers and requested the government to take measures to establish relations with other countries and the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 3rd: According to Cairo Radio, an official spokesperson announced today that the United Arab Republic has formally recognized the Republic of Guinea.

Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd: TASS, Paris dispatch: The declaration of independence by Guinea has been met with extreme hostility by the French ruling clique.

After the "referendum," the French government immediately decided to stop lending to Guinea, cancel its obligations to carry out various projects in Guinea, and instruct French technical experts to terminate contracts signed with the Guinean authorities within two months.

Maurice Félix, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, commented on this decision by the French government in "l'Humanité," saying, "This is nothing more than intimidation and pressure on the Guinean government and people." He demanded that the French government change its position towards Guinea and abandon the policy of threats and intimidation.

    法国政府殖民主义面目毕露公然对几内亚采取恫吓手段
    新华社3日讯　科纳克里消息：几内亚议会2日举行会议，正式宣告几内亚独立，并且把这个新生的非洲国家定名为“几内亚共和国”。
    几内亚议会原来是法属几内亚的领地议会（前译协商会议）。今天这个议会宣布它本身成为起草几内亚共和国的宪法的制宪议会。
    旧的几内亚政府向议会提出辞职，议会自然授权前政府总理塞古·杜尔组织新政府。新政府有十一位成员。杜尔除担任总理外，还将兼管外交和国防事务。议会决定给予新政府以充分的权力，并且要求政府采取措施来同其他国家和联合国建立联系。
    新华社开罗3日电　据开罗电台报道，官方发言人今天宣布，阿拉伯联合共和国已经正式承认几内亚共和国。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社巴黎3日讯：几内亚宣布独立遭到法国统治集团的极端仇视。
    在“公民投票”以后，法国政府马上决定停止贷款给几内亚，取消在几内亚境内进行各种工程的义务，并且指示法国的技术专家在两个月内解除同几内亚当局签订的合同。
    法国共产党中央政治局委员费克斯在“人道报”上评论法国政府这个决定说，“这不外是对几内亚政府和人民的恫吓和压力”。他要求法国政府改变对几内亚的立场，放弃威胁和恫吓政策。
