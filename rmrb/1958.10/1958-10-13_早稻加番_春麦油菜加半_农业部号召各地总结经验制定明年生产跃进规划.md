Early rice has more than doubled, and spring wheat and rapeseed have each increased by more than half. These are the results of the bumper harvests announced in the three production bulletins of the Ministry of Agriculture (full text on page 3). The Ministry of Agriculture also called on all regions to formulate production plans for next year on the basis of summarizing this year's experience in achieving high yields, and strive for a greater leap forward.

In 1958, more than 146 million mu of early rice across the country achieved a bumper harvest, with a total output of over 87 billion jin of rice, an increase of over 48 billion jin compared to the 38.7 billion jin in 1957, representing an increase of 126%; the yield per mu was 596 jin, an increase of 269 jin compared to the 327 jin in 1957, representing an increase of 82%. The increase in early rice production this year alone is more than 12 billion jin greater than the total annual increase in rice production during the First Five-Year Plan. This year, there are more than 15 million mu of early rice with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, accounting for more than 10% of the early rice planting area. There are four provinces and cities with early rice yields of over 1,000 jin, namely Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Anhui. There are also 115 counties (cities) across the country with early rice yields of over 1,000 jin per mu, among which Xiaogan County in Hubei Province has the highest yield per mu, with an average yield of 1,855 jin per mu on 302,000 mu of early rice. This year, there are more than 300 mu of high-yield early rice fields with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu, among which the 1.01 mu experimental plot of the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Pingqing Township in Macheng County, Hubei Province, yielded 16,260 jin per mu; the Jian Guo No.1 Agricultural Cooperative of Maxihe Township in the same county adopted the method of merging seedlings, and 1.016 mu of early rice yielded an average of 36,956 jin of dried grain per mu.

Following the bumper harvest of winter wheat, spring wheat has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The planting area was 43.19 million mu, with a total output of over 10 billion jin, an increase of over 3.9 billion jin compared to 1957, representing an increase of 63%; the yield per mu was 233 jin, an increase of 106 jin compared to 1957, representing an increase of 83%. According to preliminary statistics, this year there are more than 1.24 million mu of spring wheat with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. He Zheng County and Dunhuang County in Gansu Province have yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. The Saishike Farm in Qinghai Province created the highest record for spring wheat yield per unit area, with an average yield of 8,585 jin per mu on a 1.059 mu experimental plot.

This year's bumper harvest of rapeseed has begun to change the backward situation of oil crop production. The country's 37.92 million mu of rapeseed had a total output of over 27 million dan, an increase of about 10 million dan compared to 1957, representing an increase of 56.5%; the yield per mu was 73 jin, an increase of 41.5% compared to last year. Six provinces and regions, including Shanghai, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Jiangsu, and Sichuan, have an average rapeseed yield of over 100 jin per mu. The highest record for rapeseed yield per mu has broken through 1,000 jin. The No. 1 Agricultural Cooperative of Minji Township in Macheng County, Hubei, achieved 1,146 jin per mu on 2.1 mu of rapeseed, and the Delingha Farm in Qinghai achieved 2,161 jin per mu on 1.302 mu of spring rapeseed.

    早稻加番　春麦油菜加半
    农业部号召各地总结经验制定明年生产跃进规划
    本报讯　今年早稻比去年增长一倍多，春小麦和油菜各增长半倍多。这是农业部三个生产公报中公布的大丰收成果（全文见第三版）。农业部并且号召各地在总结今年丰产经验的基础上，制定明年生产规划，争取更大的跃进。
    1958年全国一亿四千六百多万亩早稻获得大丰收，总产稻谷八百七十多亿斤，比1957年的三百八十七亿斤，增加四百八十多亿斤，即增长126％；单位面积产量五百九十六斤，比1957年的三百二十七斤，增加二百六十九斤，即增长82％。今年一年早稻增产数，比第一个五年计划期间稻谷产量逐年递增总数多一百二十多亿斤。今年全国早稻亩产千斤以上的共有一千五百多万亩，占早稻播种面积10％以上。早稻千斤省市有四个，即上海市、江苏省、湖北省和安徽省。全国还有一百一十五个县（市）早稻亩产千斤以上，其中以湖北省孝感县亩产量最高，全县三十万二千多亩早稻，平均亩产一千八百五十五斤。今年早稻亩产万斤以上的高额丰产田有三百多亩，其中湖北省麻城县平清乡第二农业社一亩零一厘试验田，亩产一万六千二百六十斤；这个县的麻溪河乡建国第一农业社采用并秧办法，一亩零一厘六毫早稻，平均亩产干谷三万六千九百五十六斤。
    继冬小麦丰收之后，今年春小麦也获得空前丰收。播种面积四千三百一十九万亩，总产一百多亿斤，比1957年增产三十九亿多斤，即增长63％；单位面积产量二百三十三斤，比1957年增产一百零六斤，即增长83％。据初步统计，今年春小麦亩产千斤以上的面积有一百二十四万多亩。甘肃省的和政县和敦煌县亩产千斤以上。青海省赛什克农场创造春小麦单位面积产量最高纪录，一点零五九亩试验田，平均亩产八千五百八十五斤。
    今年油菜的丰收，开始改变了油料生产落后的情况。全国三千七百九十二万亩油菜，总产量达二千七百多万担，比1957年增产约一千万担，即增长56.5％；单位面积产量七十三斤，比去年增产41.5％。上海、甘肃、青海、新疆、江苏、四川等六个省区市，油菜平均亩产在一百斤以上。油菜亩产最高纪录突破千斤，湖北麻城闽集乡第一农业社二亩一分油菜亩产一千一百四十六斤，青海德令哈农场一点三○二亩春油菜，亩产二千一百六十一斤。（附图片）
