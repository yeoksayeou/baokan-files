High yield requires a bumper harvest, and not a single grain should be lost. This is the slogan of action proposed by the Yuan Hongshan Village Agricultural Cooperative of the Shangyou People's Commune in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province. This cooperative previously had crude and wasteful practices during the autumn harvest, especially being eager to clear the land for wheat planting, moving the crops to the edge of the field, and losing a layer of grains on the ground when pulling them back. To ensure that the abundant harvest was safely stored, the cooperative management committee organized elderly women who could not do heavy work to glean the fields and sweep up scattered grains. These people were very careful in gleaning and sweeping. One person could glean more than ten jin of grain a day. Twenty-one elderly women gleaned more than 300 jin of grain every day. They not only gleaned and swept, but also said to the people harvesting in the fields: "This year's bumper harvest is not easy to come by, it is the result of a year of hard work. Be careful when cutting and placing the crops, and don't let the grains fall off." Many people harvested more carefully after their persuasion.

    丰产丰收　颗粒不丢
    丰产要丰收，颗粒都不丢，这是山西省平遥县上游人民公社原洪善村农业社提出的行动口号。这个社原来在秋收上有粗糙和丢失现象，尤其是急于腾地种麦，将庄稼搬到地头地埝，经往回拉取，地上即脱落一层。社管理委员会为使丰收的庄稼颗粒还仓，组织了不能干重活的老年妇女到地拾穗扫颗，这些人在拾穗扫颗上很细心。一个人一天能拾粮十几斤。有二十一个老年妇女每天拾粮三百余斤。他们不仅拾穗扫颗，还向地里割庄稼的人说：“今年丰收是不易的，是一年来苦战的成果，割时放时都要小心，不要脱了颗。”许多人在他们劝说下收割得更细了。
