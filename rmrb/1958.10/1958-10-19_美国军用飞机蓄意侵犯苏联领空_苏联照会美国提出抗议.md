Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: TASS reported from Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov handed a note of protest from the Soviet government to the U.S. government to U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thompson on the 16th. The note protested the violation of Soviet airspace by a U.S. military aircraft on September 30th of this year.

The note stated that, according to conclusive evidence, a U.S. military aircraft violated the Soviet border three times in the Chukchi Peninsula region of eastern Soviet Union between 19:51 and 22:24 on September 30th of this year and circled over Soviet territorial waters and Ratmanov Island for some time.

The flight path of the aforementioned U.S. aircraft indicates that this time, the U.S. Air Force aircraft intentionally intruded into Soviet airspace for reconnaissance activities. According to reports from relevant Soviet authorities, incidents of U.S. aircraft violating Soviet airspace in the Chukchi Peninsula, Kamchatka, and Kuril Islands regions of the Soviet Union also occurred in July, August, and September of this year.

The note pointed out that it is impossible not to pay attention to the fact that this new violation of Soviet airspace by a U.S. aircraft occurred precisely when the U.S. government was flatly denying the fact that another U.S. aircraft had intentionally violated the southern border of the Soviet Union.

The note emphasized that, contrary to the U.S. government's repeated assurances that it would take strict measures to prevent U.S. aircraft from violating Soviet airspace, it has in fact approved these violations, not only failing to punish these criminals who violated the border, but also sheltering them.

The note concluded by saying that the Soviet government once again warned that the U.S. government would bear full responsibility for the repeated violations of Soviet airspace by U.S. aircraft and all the consequences arising from these violations.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 17th: The Soviet government reiterated in a note that, regarding the circumstances of the personnel on the U.S. military aircraft, there is no other information other than the intelligence already provided to the U.S. side on September 24th. This aircraft intentionally intruded into Soviet airspace and crashed in the territory of Yerevan in the Soviet Union.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov handed a note to U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Thompson on the 16th. The note pointed out that if the U.S. government takes strict measures to prevent U.S. aircraft from intruding into Soviet airspace in the future, it can eliminate one of the constant sources of tension in Soviet-U.S. relations, and also make it unnecessary for the Soviet government to write letters on such issues.

The note said that the Soviet government once again emphasized its demand that U.S. aircraft no longer violate the Soviet border and Soviet airspace, and firmly rejected the attempt to hold the Soviet Union responsible for the fate of the personnel on the crashed aircraft and for the loss of the aircraft. The note pointed out that this responsibility should be borne by those who ordered U.S. aircraft to violate the Soviet border and intrude into Soviet airspace.

    美国军用飞机蓄意侵犯苏联领空
    苏联照会美国提出抗议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫16日把苏联政府给美国政府的一份抗议照会交给了美国驻莫斯科大使汤普逊。照会对美国军用飞机于今年9月30日侵犯苏联领空提出抗议。
    照会说，根据确凿的材料，美国军用飞机于今年9月30日十九点五十一分至二十二点二十四分时间内在苏联东部楚克奇半岛地区三次侵犯苏联国境，并在苏联领水和拉特曼诺夫岛上空盘旋了一些时间。
    上述美国飞机的飞行路线表明，美国空军飞机这一次是有意侵入苏联领空进行侦察活动的。根据苏联有关机关的报告，今年7月、8月、9月间也曾发生过美国飞机侵犯楚克奇半岛、堪察加和千岛群岛地区的苏联领空的情况。
    照会指出，不能不注意，美国飞机对于苏联领空这一次新的侵犯，是正当美国政府矢口否认另一架美国飞机有意侵犯苏联南部国境这一事实的时候发生的。
    照会强调指出，与美国政府多次保证要采取严厉措施防止美国飞机侵犯苏联领空的诺言相反，它在事实上批准了这些侵犯行动，不但不对这些侵犯国境的罪犯加以惩戒，反而庇护他们。
    照会最后说，苏联政府再一次提出警告，对于美国飞机一再侵犯苏联领空以及由这些侵犯行动所产生的种种后果，美国政府要负完全责任。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科17日讯：苏联政府在一份照会中重申，关于美国军用飞机上的人员的情况，除了早在9月24日就已交给美方代表的情报以外，没有任何其他消息。这架飞机是有意侵入苏联领空而在苏联的埃里温境内坠落的。
    苏联外交部副部长库兹涅佐夫16日交给美国驻莫斯科大使汤普逊一份照会。照会指出，如果美国政府采取严格措施今后不允许美国飞机侵入苏联领空，那就可以消除苏美关系紧张的经常根源之一，同时也可以使苏联政府不必为这类问题写信了。
    照会说，苏联政府再次强调要求美国飞机不再侵犯苏联国境，苏联领空，并坚决驳斥想要苏联对坠毁了的飞机上的人员的命运负责、对损失飞机一事负责的企图。照会中指出，这个责任应该由那些命令美国飞机侵犯苏联国境、窜入苏联领空的人来负。
