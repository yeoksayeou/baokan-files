    Visiting Friendship Road
    By our reporters Chen Quanbi and Cui Yongchang
    We will never forget our days as guests in Alakol. Our enthusiastic Kazakh friends treated us almost every day with their famous dishes, Beshbarmak and Kuurdak [Note]. After several rounds of drinks, they would always play the dombra and sing the beautiful poems and songs of their famous national poet Abai and composer Galymbekuly. The Kazakh people's bold and hospitable character left a deep impression on us.
    Alakol is a small town in the Taldy-Kurgan Oblast of eastern Kazakhstan, bordering Xinjiang in our country. It is an intermediate station on the Soviet section of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Railway. From here, it extends 142 kilometers north to Aktogay, which is the terminal station of Friendship Road within Soviet territory. From here, it extends 260 kilometers south to the Soviet border, connecting with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in our country. Twenty-eight stations are planned to be built on this line, three of which are the largest. One is Friendship Station, close to our border, with a diameter of two and a half kilometers. The second is Aktogay, which will grow from its current population of 10,000 to 100,000 after Friendship Road opens to traffic. The other is this small town, Alakol. Currently, the entire road construction project of Friendship Road has been completed, and as of early September, more than 200 kilometers of track have been laid. The entire project is expected to be basically completed by April next year, striving to open to traffic by the end of next year.
    We boarded a light rail car specially prepared for us from Alakol on a construction train, heading north to south, towards the connecting point of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Railway, towards the border between our two countries. The newly laid tracks rattled under the wheels of the light rail car. We were traveling at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour. Friendship Road, like a swimming dragon, stretched straight from Aktogay into our country's border on the wide and flat Junggar Plain. To the right of the railway are the spurs of the Tian Shan Mountains, the Junggar Alatau Mountains, and to the left are the spurs of the Altai Mountains, the Arlyk Mountains. We traveled in the brisk wind, proud to be among the first Chinese passengers on Friendship Road in the Soviet Union. The track only extended to Koktuma, and we switched to cars to continue our journey. That night, we stayed at the headquarters of the Soviet border guards in Tokty Village, 38 kilometers from our national border. The young border guard commander, Lushenov, was an enthusiastic and hospitable man. In his office hung a three-foot-square portrait of Chairman Mao, and the Russian-language editions of "China Friendship" magazine were neatly bound, with several books on Chinese issues lying flat on his bookshelf. Clearly, he was a person very concerned about Chinese issues. Although it was late at night, he still talked to us incessantly about some friendship stories that had occurred on the Sino-Soviet border. He said that because the border area was sparsely populated, there were no obvious boundary markers, so it was common for residents of the Soviet Union and China to mistakenly enter each other's territory. He said that the year before last, several cadres from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region went to the pastoral areas for a meeting, but ended up at their headquarters. According to border guard regulations, they could only keep these people. However, the border guards held a grand meeting to welcome these Chinese comrades, inviting them to see operas and attend banquets, and asking them to give reports on Chinese issues. Finally, they sent people to escort them to Urumqi. Last year, a pastoral cooperative in Xinjiang, near their station, was in danger of starving to death due to heavy snow and a lack of feed for livestock. They helped the pastoral cooperative solve the problem of grassland. During the New Year, festivals, or grand holidays, the border guards and residents of both the Soviet Union and China frequently have exchanges. For example, last year, on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Soviet border guards sent a delegation to congratulate them. On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army also sent a delegation to the Soviet border guards.
    In order to save time, we bid farewell to the enthusiastic friends of the Soviet border guards early the next morning, leaving Tokty Village and heading east, continuing towards the border. There were no roads in this area, and the car traveled through clumps of wild plants, which the locals call saksaul and the Chinese call salt cedar. From the ground, they only showed a small pile, but the roots were very deep. When building the railway, tractors were often needed to pull them up by the roots.
    The so-called border line had no visible boundary markers. There was only a "п"-shaped wooden fence erected in a place where less saksaul grew. A few steps away from the fence was an iron tower, but it had been blown down by the habitual storms here and lay quietly on the ground. Next to the iron tower, two giant plaques written in both Soviet and Chinese characters were neatly laid flat. They were written in Chinese and Russian, respectively, "The Eternal Friendship Road of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China." In the middle of the iron tower, facing each other, stood two wooden signs, one written in Russian: "Final Measurement Point from Aktogay to the Soviet Border," and the other written in Chinese: "Final Measurement Point of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway of the People's Republic of China." This was the connecting point of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Railway, the junction of the sacred territory where our two great nations, the Soviet Union and China, with our two great ethnic groups, are as close as lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. At this time, the enthusiastic Kazakh friends who accompanied us on the visit took out vodka again. We each stood on our own soil, toasting to the health of all the construction workers of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Road and their glorious labor, to congratulate the early opening of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Railway, and to our ever-consolidating and developing friendship between our two countries!
    What impressed us most during the visit to the railway construction project was the spirit of the construction workers who were not afraid of difficulties and struggled against them, and their high labor enthusiasm. When this railway began construction, the difficulties were indescribable. Hundreds and thousands of railway workers responded to the call of the Party and the government to participate in the construction of this railway, but the first problem they encountered was the lack of housing. They could only live in train carriages. Some lived in temporary tents. When the wind blew, it came in through the cracks in the carriages, and the workers shivered with cold. Because transportation could not keep up, the workers also encountered many difficulties in their diet, and bathing was out of the question. The biggest difficulty was the difficulty in the construction project. The workers had to fight against the wind and sand and the mountain torrents rushing down from the Tianshan Mountains. But all these difficulties did not stop the railway workers from moving forward. On the contrary, their labor enthusiasm became even higher, and their production efficiency increased even more. Kakuliya, the captain of the automated road construction team, told us that his team had built many railways, but he had never seen such high labor enthusiasm among the workers as today. He said that the quota for each excavator is generally 100,000 cubic meters, but in order to build the Friendship Road, everyone voluntarily increased the quota to 170,000 cubic meters. Even so, the workers still exceeded it by one or two times. Walin, a 22-year-old young excavator worker, often exceeded his work quota by 300%. Even so, he was still looking for tricks to tap potential, preparing to continue to improve. Walin is not only an advanced worker, but also a poet. He recently wrote a long poem praising the Friendship Railway. Vosik, a track-laying worker, also worked very well. The automated track-laying team he was in could lay one or two kilometers a day. He said that he had no other ideas now, only hoping to lay the railway to the border as soon as possible, so that the two fraternal countries could meet as soon as possible. He repeatedly expressed to us his hope to know the construction situation of our Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, hoping to exchange experience with the Chinese workers…… In short, from Aktogay to the Soviet border, hundreds of thousands of Soviet workers, after countless hardships, tasted the lonely life of the desert grassland, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, enduring the wind and rain, but they always overfulfilled their tasks. Because they are working hard for one purpose, one wish, and that is Sino-Soviet friendship! To build Friendship Road as soon as possible!
    Although the Friendship Railway has not yet been finally built, enthusiastic poets and singers have used their own poems and songs to praise it. When we finished our visit to Friendship Road and returned to Almaty, Bekov, a young poet from Alakol, recited aloud to us his recently written long poem singing the Friendship Road:
    We are brave builders,
    Singing even in the face of heavy snow and wind.
    Through the peaceful land of the Junggar Plain,
    We pave Friendship Road towards the Chinese hills.
                ×　×　×
    Facing the rising sun in the distance,
    We are determined to build the great Friendship Road.
    Conquering the desert,
    Overcoming the storm,
    Let our friendship with our brothers in China
    Last forever.
    Note: Beshbarmak is a dish of large pieces of mutton on noodles. Along with Beshbarmak, a cooked sheep's head is brought to the table. At the request of the host, the guest must cut off the left ear of the sheep and give it to the person on his left, the right ear to the person on his right, the eyes to the person he loves most, the tongue to the host, and the sheep's brain to the oldest person. Kuurdak is a particularly delicious fried sheep offal. (Attached image)

    访友谊路
    本报记者　陈泉璧　崔永昌
    我们永远也不会忘掉在阿拉库尔作客的那几天，那里热情的哈萨克朋友们差不多每天都以他们的名菜比斯巴尔马克和库尔达克〔注〕来款待我们，在酒过几巡以后，他们总是弹起东布拉，唱起他们著名民族诗人阿拜和作曲家加仑贝叶夫的美丽的诗篇和歌曲。哈萨克人这种豪迈好客的性格，给我们留下了极深的印象。
    阿拉库尔是哈萨克斯坦东部与我国新疆毗邻的塔尔得库尔干州的一个小镇，它是苏中友谊铁路苏联段的中间站。由此北伸一百四十二公里到阿克斗卡，那里是友谊路在苏联境内的终点站，由此向南二百六十公里到苏联国境与我国兰新铁路接轨。这条线上准备建二十八个车站，其中三个最大，一个是接近我国边境的友谊站，直径两公里半。一个是阿克斗卡，友谊路通车后那里将由现在的一万人发展到十万人。另一个就是这个小镇——阿拉库尔。现在友谊路全线筑路工程已全部结束，铺轨工程截至9月初已铺二百多公里，全线工程准备提早在明年4月基本结束，争取明年年底通车。
    我们从阿拉库尔乘建筑列车特为我们准备的轻油车，由北向南，向苏中友谊铁路的接轨处，向我们两国的国境进发，不久前铺好的路轨，被轻油车压得轧轧发响。我们以每小时七十公里的速度前进，友谊路像一条游龙一样在宽广平坦的中加尔平原上由阿克斗卡直伸入我国国境。铁路的右侧是天山余脉中加尔阿拉道山，左侧是阿尔泰山余脉阿尔里克山。我们在疾风中驶行，以能在苏联作为友谊路的第一批中国乘客而感到骄傲。路轨只铺到库克图马，我们又改乘汽车继续前行。这一晚我们住在离我国国境三十八公里的托克斗村的苏军边防军司令部里。年青的边防军司令官卢舍诺夫是一位热情而又好客的人，他的办公室里挂着一幅三尺见方的毛主席像、俄文版的中国友谊杂志一期期的装订得很好，几本有关中国问题的书籍在他的书架上平放着。显然，他是一个对中国问题十分关心的人。虽然夜已深了，但他还是滔滔不绝地告诉我们发生在苏中边境的一些友谊的故事。他说，由于边境人烟稀少，看不出有明显的标界，所以苏中两国居民误入对方国境是常有的事。他说，前年新疆自治区有几个干部到牧区去开会，结果却走到他们司令部去了。按照边防军的规定只能把这些人留下。但是边防军却开大会欢迎这几个中国同志，请他们看戏赴宴，并请他们作有关中国问题的报告，最后还派人把他们护送到乌鲁木齐。去年靠近他们驻地的新疆的一个牧业社，因为下了大雪，牲畜缺乏饲料有饿死的危险，他们便帮助牧业社解决了草地的问题。每逢过年过节或盛大节日，苏中两国边防军和驻地居民都是经常有往来的。例如去年中国人民解放军建军三十周年，苏联边防军就派了代表团过去祝贺，苏军建军四十周年时，中国人民解放军也派了代表团到苏联边防军这方面来。
    为了争取时间，第二天一大早我们就告别了苏联边防军的热情的朋友，离开托克斗村东行，继续向国境前进。这一带已无路可走，汽车在一丛丛的野生植物中穿行，这种植物当地人叫作沙克沙胡尔，中国叫盐木。从地面上看，它们只露出很小的一堆，但根却长得很深，修筑铁路时，往往要用拖拉机才能把它们连根拔起。
    所谓国境线，根本看不出一点标界，只是在一块沙克沙胡尔长得少的地方竖着一个像“п”字形的木栅，离开木栅几步，有一个铁塔，但已被这里所惯有的暴风刮倒，安静地躺在地上。铁塔一旁整齐地平放着两块用苏中两国文字写成的巨型匾额，分别用中、俄文写着“苏联和中华人民共和国的永恒友谊之路”。在铁塔中间，面对面竖着两块木牌，一块用俄文写着“阿克斗卡到苏联国境线定测终点”，一块用中文写着“中华人民共和国兰新铁路定测终点”。这就是苏中友谊铁路的接轨处，这就是我们苏中两大民族两个伟大国家唇齿相依患难与共的神圣领土的接壤处。这时陪我们去访问的热情的哈萨克朋友们又拿出伏特加酒来，我们各自站在自己的国土上，为苏中友谊路全体筑路工人们的健康和他们光荣的劳动，为祝贺苏中友谊铁路的早日通车，为我们苏中两国日益巩固和发展中的友谊而干杯！
    我们在访问铁路建筑工程时，给我们印象最深的是建筑工人们的不怕困难与困难斗争的精神和他们高涨的劳动热情。这条铁路开始建筑时，困难是一言难尽的，成千成百的铁路工人响应党和政府的号召来参加这条铁路建设，但首先碰到的是没有房子住，他们只能住在火车车厢中。有些住在临时支起的帐篷里，大风一刮，风从车厢的裂缝中吹进来，工人们都冻得瑟瑟发抖。因运输跟不上，工人们在饮食上也遭到不少困难，洗澡是根本谈不上的。最大的困难还是工程建设中的困难，工人们要和风沙和天山冲下来的山洪作斗争。但是所有这些困难并没有阻止铁路工人前进的步伐，相反地，他们的劳动情绪却愈加高涨，生产效力更加提高。自动化筑路队队长卡库里亚告诉我们，他领导的工作队已建筑过不少条铁路，但从来没有看见过工人们有今天这样高涨的劳动热情。他说，每台挖土机的定额一般是十万立方公尺，但为了修筑友谊路，大家自愿把定额提高到十七万立方公尺，就是这样，工人们还是把它一倍两倍地突破。二十二岁的年青挖土机工人沃林，工作定额经常突破到百分之三百，就是这样，他还在找窍门挖潜力，准备再继续提高。沃林不仅是个先进工人，而且还是个诗人呢。他不久以前刚写好一首歌颂友谊铁路的长诗。铺轨工人沃西克也工作得很出色，他所在的那个自动化铺路工作队每天就能铺一两公里。他说，他现在没有别的想法，只希望把铁路早日铺到国境，好让两国亲兄弟早日见面。他几次向我们表示，希望知道我国兰新铁路的建筑情况，希望和中国工人弟兄交换经验……。总之，从阿克斗卡到苏联国境成千上万的苏联工人，经过了无数艰难困苦，尝够了荒漠草原的寂寞生活，餐风露宿，任风雨吹打，但他们却总是超额完成着任务。因为他们是为着一个目的、一个心愿而紧张工作的，这就是苏中友谊！把友谊路早日筑成！
    友谊铁路虽然还没有最后建筑成功，但热情的诗人和歌手们却用自己撰写的诗篇和歌喉来歌颂它了，阿拉库尔年青的诗人贝科夫在我们结束友谊路访问返回阿拉木图时，他高声给我们朗诵了他最近写成的一首歌唱友谊路的长诗：
    我们是勇敢的建设者，
    冒着大风雪也照样歌唱。
    通过中加尔平原的和平地
        方，
    把友谊路铺向中国的山岗。
                ×　×　×
    迎着远方升起的朝霞，
    一心要把伟大的友谊路建成。
    征服沙漠，
    战胜暴风，
    让我们与兄弟中国的友谊
    万古长青。
