Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 25th—In the week from the 17th to the 23rd, Chongqing's average daily steel output more than doubled compared to the first half of the month. In the first half of October, Chongqing's average daily steel output was around 2,000 tons. Recently, due to the city's conscientious implementation of the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium and small scales, steel output exceeded 3,000 tons on the 15th. Afterwards, it steadily increased day by day. From the 17th to the 23rd, the average daily output reached more than 4,500 tons, and on the 23rd, it created a record of 10,116 tons.

In mid-October, Chongqing launched a mass debate to overcome the insufficient understanding of the great significance of the mass steelmaking movement and the "small, indigenous, and mass" policy among some people, and to establish the idea of combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining large, medium, and small scales, and fighting for a long time. More than 80% of the city's population was involved in the torrent of fighting for steel. A red flag competition and a movement to perform meritorious service for socialism were launched between various units and districts, with each chasing after the other. The output of indigenous steel exceeded that of several steel plants combined. On the basis of vigorously launching mass movements, several steel plants also continuously achieved outstanding results. The workers of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's open-hearth furnace, under the slogan of "Learning from Shanghai, Surpassing Shanghai," improved operating techniques in all aspects, so that the average utilization coefficient of the two open-hearth furnaces in the past week reached 17.09, exceeding the national advanced record held by Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th—Shanghai has seen a new upsurge in mass steelmaking. In the week from the 15th to the 21st, the average daily steel output reached 3,960 tons, a sharp increase of 36.7% compared to the first fourteen days of this month. On the 21st, it created an unprecedented high output record of 5,376 tons of steel per day.

In the past few days, various steel plants have vigorously launched mass movements to tap the potential of old furnaces. Since the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant jumped to catch up with the national high-yield open-hearth furnace red flag – the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant – the steel produced by the small furnace has become increasingly astonishing: the original 30-ton open-hearth furnace achieved an astonishing result of 84 tons of steel in one heat on the 21st.

Workers, government cadres, students, suburban farmers, and residents of alleyways in the city's non-metallurgical system also vigorously engaged in "small, indigenous, and mass" efforts, building more than 6,000 small converters, crucible furnaces, and indigenous open-hearth furnaces to help out. At night, one could see raging furnace fires everywhere on the squares, in front of foreign-style houses, and in the alleyways, and the sound of forging steel could be heard everywhere.

### 两大钢城竞攀钢产高峰  重庆日产钢突破万吨　上海日产五千多吨钢

    两大钢城竞攀钢产高峰
    重庆日产钢突破万吨　上海日产五千多吨钢
    据新华社重庆25日电　重庆在17日到23日这一周中钢的平均日产量比上半月猛增一倍多。10月上半月，重庆市钢的平均日产量是两千吨左右；最近由于全市认真贯彻土洋结合、大中小结合的方针，15日钢产量突破了三千吨大关，以后逐日稳步上升，17日到23日平均日产量达到四千五百多吨，23日更创造了一万零一百一十六吨的纪录。
    重庆市10月中旬曾展开全民大辩论，克服了一部分人对全民炼钢运动和“小、土、群”方针的重大意义认识不足的思想，树立了土洋结合、大中小结合和长期奋战的思想。全市有80％以上的人卷入为钢而战的洪流。各单位和各区之间展开红旗竞赛和为社会主义立功的运动，你追我赶，土钢产量就超过几个钢铁厂的一倍。几个钢铁厂在大搞群众运动的基础上，也连创优异成绩。重庆钢铁公司小平炉的工人在“学上海、超上海”的口号下，从各方面改进操作技术，使两座小平炉最近一周的平均利用系数达到十七点○九，超过了上钢一厂所保持的全国先进纪录。
    据新华社上海25日电　上海出现全民炼钢新高潮。从15日到21日的一周中，钢的平均日产量达到三千九百六十吨，比这个月的前十四天猛增36.7％，21日并创造了日产五千三百七十六吨钢的空前高产纪录。
    各炼钢厂这几天大搞群众运动，大挖老炉子的潜力。上钢一厂平炉车间自从10月一跃赶上全国平炉高产红旗——上钢三厂平炉车间以后，小小的炉子放出的钢水越来越惊人：原来三十吨的平炉，21日取得了一炉产钢八十四吨的惊人成绩。
    全市非冶金系统的工人、机关干部、学生、郊区农民、里弄居民，也大搞“小土群”，建造了六千多座小转炉、坩埚炉、土平炉等助战，一到晚上，只见广场上、洋房前、弄堂里，到处是熊熊的炉火，到处传出锻打钢铁的声音。
