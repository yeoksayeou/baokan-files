Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The million-strong railway army, with the collaborative efforts of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers across the country, has been loading an average of 40,984 cars daily for three consecutive days, the 28th, 29th, and 30th. On the 28th, the number of loaded cars reached a staggering 52,000, an 87% increase compared to the average in the first and middle ten days of September, and more than double that of the same period last year. The vehicle turnaround rate was shortened to 1.6 days. This is the first big "satellite" in China's railway transportation. This speed of leap forward is an unprecedented miracle in railway history.

This great victory in railway transportation has written the most magnificent and moving poem in the history of China's railways. It was achieved under the leadership of the Party by learning and promoting the experiences of the Camel Camp, Goubangzi, and Dahu Mountain stations of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, as well as the Changzhou Station of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, and the Guanting Station of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, using mass movements to boost transportation. On the 28th, nearly one million railway workers, workers, peasants, merchants, students, soldiers, and the transportation army participated in loading and unloading operations at railway stations across the country. Responsible comrades from the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees, as well as the prefectural, county, town, and township Party committees and people's committees along the railway lines, personally directed or participated in this transportation effort. Railways and various factories, mines, and enterprises, and fraternal departments, especially coal and steel departments, demonstrated an unprecedented new atmosphere of communist collaboration. The transportation on this day shattered all kinds of conservative ideas and pessimistic views that the railway had no more potential to tap, and provided valuable experience for creating a new transportation organization in China's railways.

On this day, in the northernmost parts of the motherland, such as Tulihe and Hailar, snowflakes had already begun to fall, and heavy rain was pouring in southern Northeast and Shandong. However, in order to transport the Marshal of Steel and materials urgently needed for the national economy as quickly as possible, the fighting people, inspired by heroic slogans such as "Every second counts" and "Cut turnaround time by half and double transportation capacity," were high in morale and full of energy. Many stations loaded as many cars as arrived and unloaded as many cars as arrived. Trains loaded with steel, ore, coal, and machinery were speeding along various railway lines. Railway workers at the Xiabancheng Station of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau braved heavy rain and worked with commune members from local people's communes to rush loading and unloading in the face of a strong gale. Many People's Liberation Army units near the stations also came to participate in the battle. Things that were previously considered impossible are now being done. Some stations unloaded a car in just two minutes, and the entire train's cargo was unloaded in just over ten minutes. Workers wrote poems saying: "Red flags flutter in the vast sky, loading and unloading workers show their heroism, laboring without fear of torrential rain, fighting through the night with the moon."

Although so many cars were loaded and the work was very intense, the transportation order was unprecedentedly good. For example, on the Shijiazhuang to Yangquan section of the railway, forty trains were dispatched overnight, all on time, and safe driving was achieved.

At present, railway workers, holding high the banner of victory, are riding the wind and waves, advancing bravely, and continuing to consolidate and expand this victory. Railway workers with a glorious revolutionary tradition are determined to show the Party and the people with their heroic actions that they must serve as a good "pioneer" and pave the way for the Marshal of Steel.

    百万铁路大军当好“先行官”
    创日装车五万多辆纪录
    新华社30日讯　百万铁路大军在全国各地工农商学兵的协同作战下，28、29、30三天每天平均装车四万零九百八十四辆。28日这一天装车数高达五万二千多辆，比9月上、中旬的平均数猛增了87％，比去年同期翻了一番多；车辆周转率缩短到一点六天，这是我国铁路运输上的第一颗大“卫星”，这样跃进的速度，是铁路史上从来没有的奇迹。
    这次铁路运输上的大胜利，在我国铁路史上写下了一首最壮丽的动人的诗篇。它是在党的领导下，全国铁路学习和推广锦州铁路局骆驼营、沟帮子、大虎山三站及上海铁路局常州站，郑州铁路局官亭站的经验，用群众运动的方式来搞运输而获得的。28日这一天，在全国各个火车站上，参加装卸作业的铁路职工和工农商学兵运输大军，总数将近一百万人。许多省、市、自治区党委以及铁路沿线的中共地委、县委、镇委、乡委和各级人民委员会的负责同志，都亲自指挥或参加这次运输。铁路同各个厂矿企业和兄弟部门，特别是煤炭、钢铁部门之间，表现出前所未有的共产主义协作的新气象。这一天的运输打破了各式各样的保守主义思想和认为铁路已再无潜力可挖等的悲观论调，对创造我国铁路新的运输组织学，提供了很宝贵的经验。
    这一天，祖国最北部的图里河、海拉尔等地，已开始雪花纷飞，东北南部和山东等地下着大雨，但是战斗的人们为了使钢铁元帅和国民经济急需的物资赶快运出去，在“分秒必争”、“周转时间砍一半、运输能力翻一番”等豪迈的口号鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。许多车站都是来多少车，装多少车；到多少车，卸多少车。一列列满载着钢铁、矿石、煤炭、机械设备的火车，风驰电掣般地在各个铁路线上奔跑。锦州铁路局下板城车站的铁路职工，在七级大风的袭击下，冒着大雨同当地人民公社的社员一起抢装抢卸。不少车站附近的人民解放军也都来参加战斗。过去认为无法做到的事，现在都做到了。有的车站两分钟就卸完一节车，整个列车的货物十几分钟就卸完了。工人作诗说：“万里长空红旗飘，装卸工人逞英豪，劳动不惧倾盆雨，伴着月亮战夜宵。”
    虽然装车这样多，工作非常紧张，但是运输秩序空前良好。如石家庄到阳泉段铁路，一夜发出四十个列车，列列都正点，而且做到了安全行车。
    目前，高举着胜利红旗的铁路职工正在乘风破浪，奋勇前进，继续巩固和扩大这次战果。具有光荣革命传统的铁路职工，决心以自己的英勇行动向党和人民表明，他们一定要当好“先行官”，为钢铁元帅开路。
