Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch from Berlin: The "Neues Deutschland," the organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, recently published an article discussing the situation of imperialism and large landowners in Latin America colluding with each other to cruelly exploit the local people.

The article stated that solving the land problem is one of the most important issues in Latin America today. With the help of foreign imperialism, the power of large landowners remains very strong in eighteen Latin American countries. In these countries, a large amount of land is concentrated in the hands of a few families. For example, in Argentina, two thousand landowners own one-fifth of the country's arable land. In Buenos Aires Province alone, a few families own 506,000 hectares of arable land. In Chile, 1% of the landowners own 52% of the country's total arable land. In Brazil, the land area occupied by two thousand estate owners is equivalent to the total area of ​​Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark, while in Colombia, 90% of the farmers do not own an inch of land.

The article pointed out that, in addition to these huge private estates, foreign companies also occupy a large amount of real estate in Latin America. For example, the American Ford Company in Brazil, the Rockefeller Company in Guatemala and Venezuela own a lot of land, and the United Fruit Company currently owns 1.6 million hectares of land in Central America.

The article continued, the large estate system in Latin America is one of the root causes of the extreme economic difficulties in Latin American countries. Large landowners often never see all of their land in their lifetime, and after renting the land to tenant farmers, they never again concern themselves with agricultural issues. The large land ownership system leaves the true cultivators of the land, the vast agricultural workers, small tenant farmers, and peasants, constantly struggling on the brink of starvation. The exploitation by large landowners makes the domestic people's purchasing power extremely low, and causes most of the wealth to flow abroad.

The article pointed out that another consequence of the large land ownership system in Latin America is that only a small portion of arable land is used for agricultural production. For example, in Venezuela, the arable land used for agricultural production accounts for only about 1%. In Brazil, it is only 1.6%, although almost half of Brazil can be cultivated.

The article emphasized that American monopoly capital's intrusion into the economies of Latin American countries has always relied on obtaining the support of the political and economic power of large landowners. Therefore, large landowners have become the social foundation for foreign imperialists in these countries. This situation is in the interest of both monopoly capital and the large landowners themselves. Whenever the people's uprising threatens the position of the large landowners, they turn to their foreign allies for help.

    “新德意志报”载文揭露
    帝国主义和封建走狗狼狈为奸
    拉丁美洲人民的生活贫困不堪
    新华社13日讯　柏林消息：德国统一社会党机关报“新德意志报”不久以前登载了一篇文章，谈到帝国主义和大地主在拉丁美洲互相勾结残酷剥削当地人民的情况。
    文章说，土地问题的解决是目前拉丁美洲最重要的问题之一。在外国帝国主义的帮助下，大地主的权力目前在十八个拉丁美洲国家里仍然是十分牢固的。在这些国家里，大量土地集中在少数家族手中。例如在阿根廷，两千个地主占有全国耕地的五分之一。仅在布宜诺斯艾利斯省，少数几个家庭就占有了五十万零六千公顷耕地。在智利，占全国人口1％的地主拥有全国耕地总面积的52％。在巴西，两千个庄园主占据的土地面积相当于意大利、荷兰、比利时和丹麦的面积总和，而在哥伦比亚，占总人口十分之九的农民却一寸土地也没有。
    文章指出，除了这些巨大的私有地产以外，外国公司也在拉丁美洲占有大量不动产。例如美国的福特公司在巴西，洛克菲勒公司在危地马拉和委内瑞拉占有很多土地，联合果品公司在中美占有的土地目前为一千六百万公顷。
    文章接着说，拉丁美洲的大庄园制度是拉丁美洲各国经济极端困难的根本原因之一。大地主往往一辈子没有看见过他的全部土地，他们在把土地租给佃农以后，从来不再过问农业问题。大土地占有制度使得土地的真正耕作者，广大的农业工人、小佃户和农民经常在饥饿线上挣扎。大地主的压榨使得国内人民的购买力极端低下，使大部分财富流往外国。
    文章指出，拉丁美洲大土地占有制的另一个后果是，只有很小一部分可耕土地用于农业生产。例如，在委内瑞拉，用于农业生产的可耕土地只占1％左右。在巴西，只有1.6％，虽然巴西全国几乎有一半土地可以垦殖。
    文章强调指出，美国垄断资本侵入拉丁美洲各国的经济，向来是依靠取得大地主的政治和经济力量的支持。因此，大地主成了外国帝国主义者在这些国家的社会基础。这种情况既符合垄断资本的利益，也符合大地主本身的利益。每当人民的起义威胁着大地主的地位的时候，他们就向外国同盟者求援。
