Under the persistent struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern Arab countries and the world's peace-loving people, the American troops who invaded Lebanon were finally forced to roll out of Lebanon completely on October 25. The British troops who invaded Jordan are also reluctantly withdrawing from that country once again. When the American invading troops invaded Lebanon in July, they were aggressive and extremely rampant. However, in a short period of time, now it has to lower its flag and silence its drums, quietly leaving, just like the situation after the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of the Suez Canal in Egypt in 1956! The forced withdrawal of the American invading troops from Lebanon once again convincingly proves that the forces defending peace and defending national independence are invincible; any aggressor who dares to despise this force and carry out aggression will only end in shameful failure.

When the American aggressors colluded with Britain and began to send troops to invade Lebanon and Jordan, their invasion plan was not limited to these two countries, but was aimed at Iraq and the United Arab Republic, and at the people of the entire Middle East. The arrogant attempt of the American aggressors was to strangle the entire Middle Eastern Arab national independence movement, enslave the people of these countries, plunder these countries' rich oil resources, and establish American colonial rule in the entire Middle East. On July 15, U.S. President Eisenhower, in a statement issued for the invasion of Lebanon, described the victory of the Iraqi people's revolution to overthrow the Faisal dynasty as a reason for the United States to send troops to invade Lebanon, and wantonly slandered and smeared the United Arab Republic for "infiltrating" Lebanon. Now, after staying on the Lebanese coast for three and a half months, the American aggressors finally have to roll back. This is a shameful bankruptcy of the American plan to invade the Middle East, and a great victory for the people of the Middle East and the people of the world against colonialism and in defense of peace.

The bankruptcy of the American plan to invade the Middle East is the result of the persistent struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern countries, and the result of the persistent struggle of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. As soon as the American invading troops climbed onto the beaches of Lebanon, socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and China promptly issued stern warnings that they could not stand idly by to the American aggression. With the support of socialist countries and world progressive public opinion, the people of the Middle East also strengthened their struggle to safeguard national independence, causing the American aggressors to be trapped in the mire of the Lebanese coast, making it difficult to advance or retreat. Initially, the United States attempted to use the old trick it played in the Korean War, stealing the banner of the United Nations to cover up its aggression against Lebanon, replacing the American invading troops with so-called United Nations forces. However, this conspiracy was immediately exposed by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries and world public opinion that uphold the national independence of the Arab countries in the Middle East, and ended in failure. After the United Nations Emergency Special Session, convened at the suggestion of the Soviet Union, passed a proposal on August 21st requesting the withdrawal of American and British invading troops from the Middle East, the American aggressors still resorted to various conspiracies and tricks, disobeyed the resolutions of the United Nations, and tried to delay the withdrawal of its invading troops. Even after the US government issued a statement on withdrawing its troops on October 8, its ambassador to Beirut publicly came forward to support the Chamoun clique, which had been abandoned by the Lebanese people, to carry out sabotage in Lebanon, attempting to force the Karami government to collapse, so as to create the so-called "unforeseeable situation" by the United States, as an excuse for it to refuse to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. However, under the strong condemnation and opposition of world public opinion and the patriotic people of Lebanon, these conspiracies of the American aggressors did not succeed, and in the end they had to roll out of Lebanon completely. The failure of the American plan to invade the Middle East and the forced withdrawal of American invading troops from Lebanon once again show that only by resolutely fighting against the aggressors can national independence be safeguarded and peace be defended. At the same time, the outcome of this struggle also proves that as long as the people of all countries unite and act in unison, the most ferocious American imperialism can be completely defeated, and the American imperialism's conspiracy to create war can also be completely stopped. For the people of all countries who are truly willing to fight resolutely for peace and for the maintenance of national independence, the United States is nothing more than a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak, and there is nothing to be afraid of.

American interference in Lebanon is fundamentally unreasonable. The American aggressors have created various excuses to defend and whitewash their acts of aggression. However, the people of all countries have not been deceived by these shameless lies of the American aggressors. On the contrary, the American aggression against Lebanon has further brightened the eyes of the people of all countries, making them see the face of the American aggressors more clearly. If the United States played the good guy in the Anglo-French war of aggression against the Suez Canal, it could still prevent some people from seeing its aggressive face, then this action of aggression against Lebanon exposed its true colors. As the "Beirut Evening News" wrote in its commentary on the American withdrawal: "The American invading troops have left shameful, disgraceful and inglorious traces of aggression on the beaches and waves of Lebanon." Obviously, the US military's entry into Lebanon this time did not gain anything except to completely expose its aggressive face.

There is no doubt that the American aggressors will not be reconciled to their shameful failure in the Middle East. All aggressors are "unwilling to give up until they reach the Yellow River," and "will not shed tears until they see the coffin." The forced withdrawal of American invading troops from Lebanon is just a change in the tricks of aggression. There are various signs that the American aggressors are stepping up their efforts to provoke disunity among Arab countries, split the Arab League, so as to defeat the Arab countries one by one and put the shackles of enslavement on the people of these countries. The recent disunity within the Arab League will not be accidental. What is even more alarming is that although the American invading troops have withdrawn from Lebanon, the American troops have not withdrawn from the entire Middle East. In Turkey, in Israel, and in Libya, there are strong American military bases that still threaten peace in the Middle East and threaten the independence and sovereignty of Middle Eastern countries. Therefore, the people of all countries in the Middle East must strive to strengthen unity, remain vigilant at all times, and continue to fight against the enemies of peace and national independence.

### 被迫的撤退　可耻的下场

    被迫的撤退　可耻的下场
    在中东阿拉伯国家人民和世界爱好和平人民坚持斗争下，侵略黎巴嫩的美国军队，终于在10月25日被迫全部滚出了黎巴嫩。侵略约旦的英国军队，也正在无可奈何地再一次从那个国家撤退。美国侵略军在7月间侵入黎巴嫩的时候，气势汹汹，十分猖狂。然而，曾几何时，现在它却不得不偃旗息鼓，悄然而去，恰像1956年英法侵略埃及苏伊士运河失败后的情景！美国侵略军被迫从黎巴嫩撤退，再一次使人信服地证明，保卫和平，保卫民族独立的力量，是不可战胜的；任何侵略者如果敢于轻侮这种力量，肆行侵略，都只能以可耻的失败而告终。
    美国侵略者勾结英国，开始派兵侵入黎巴嫩和约旦的时候，它们的侵略计划并不是限于这两个国家，而是针对着伊拉克和阿拉伯联合共和国，针对着整个中东的人民的。美国侵略者的狂妄企图，是要扼杀整个中东阿拉伯民族独立运动，奴役这些国家的人民，掠夺这些国家丰富的石油资源，在整个中东地区建立起美国的殖民统治。7月15日，美国总统艾森豪威尔在为侵略黎巴嫩而发表的声明中，曾把伊拉克人民推翻费萨尔王朝的革命的胜利，说成为美国派兵侵略黎巴嫩的理由，并且肆意诽谤和诬蔑阿拉伯联合共和国“渗入”黎巴嫩。现在，美国侵略者在黎巴嫩海滨呆了三个半月之后，终于不得不滚回去。这是美国侵略中东计划的可耻的破产，这是中东人民和世界人民反对殖民主义、保卫和平的巨大胜利。
    美国侵略中东计划的破产，是中东各国人民坚持斗争的结果，是世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民坚持斗争的结果。美国侵略军刚一爬上黎巴嫩海滩，苏联、中国等社会主义国家就及时发出了对美国侵略行为不能袖手旁观的严厉警告。中东人民在社会主义国家和世界进步舆论的支持之下，也加强了维护民族独立的斗争，使美国侵略者陷于黎巴嫩海滩的泥淖中，进退两难。最初，美国企图使用它在侵略朝鲜战争中所玩弄的故伎，盗用联合国的旗帜来掩饰它对黎巴嫩的侵略，以所谓联合国部队来代替美国侵略军。可是，这个阴谋立即遭到苏联等爱好和平和维护中东阿拉伯各国民族独立的国家和世界公正舆论的揭露，而归于失败。苏联建议召开的联合国紧急特别会议，在8月21日通过了十个阿拉伯国家要求美英侵略军从中东撤退的提案以后，美国侵略者仍然施展种种阴谋诡计，违抗联合国的决议，力图拖延撤退它的侵略军。甚至美国政府在10月8日发表撤军声明之后，它驻贝鲁特的大使还公开出面支持被黎巴嫩人民抛弃了的夏蒙集团，在黎巴嫩进行捣乱，企图迫使卡拉米政府垮台，以制造美国所谓的“无法预料的局势”，作为它拒绝从黎巴嫩撤军的借口。但是，在世界舆论和黎巴嫩爱国人民的强烈谴责和反对下，美国侵略者的这些阴谋都未能得逞，最后还是不得不全部滚出黎巴嫩。美国侵略中东计划的失败和美国侵略军被迫撤出黎巴嫩的事实再一次表明，只有对侵略者进行坚决的斗争，才能维护民族独立，保卫和平。同时，这一场斗争的结局也证明，只要各国人民一致团结和行动起来，最凶恶的美帝国主义是完全可以打败的，美帝国主义制造战争的阴谋也是完全可以制止的。对于真正愿意为了和平、为了维护民族独立而坚决战斗的各国人民，美国不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎，是并没有什么可怕的。
    美国对黎巴嫩的干涉是根本没有道理的。美国侵略者曾经制造各种各样借口，来为自己的侵略行为辩护和洗刷。但是，各国人民并没有为美国侵略者的这些无耻谎言所蒙蔽。正好相反，美国侵略黎巴嫩的行动，更加擦亮了各国人民的眼睛，使他们更加看清了美国侵略者的面目。如果说，美国在英法侵略苏伊士运河的战争中，假充好人，还能使一些人看不清它的侵略者的嘴脸，那末，在这次侵略黎巴嫩的行动中，却使它原形毕露了。正如“贝鲁特晚报”在评论美国撤军时所写的：“美国侵略军在黎巴嫩的海滩上、海浪中，都留下了可耻、丢脸和不光彩的侵略痕迹”。很显然，美国这次进兵黎巴嫩，除了彻底暴露了它这种侵略面目以外，没有捞到任何一点东西。
    毫无疑问，美国侵略者不会甘心于在中东的可耻失败。一切侵略者都是“不到黄河心不死”，“不见棺材不落泪”的。美国侵略军被迫撤出黎巴嫩，不过是变换侵略的花样。有种种迹象表明，美国侵略者正加紧挑拨阿拉伯国家之间的团结，分裂阿拉伯联盟，以便把阿拉伯国家各个击破，把奴役的枷锁加在这些国家的人民的头上。最近阿拉伯联盟内部所发生的不团结现象，决不会是偶然的。更值得警惕的是，美国侵略军虽然已经从黎巴嫩撤退，美国军队并没有从整个中东地区撤退。在土耳其，在以色列，在利比亚，都有着美国强大军事基地，仍然威胁着中东地区的和平，威胁着中东国家的独立和主权。因此，中东各国人民要努力加强团结，时刻提高警惕，继续同和平和民族独立的敌人进行斗争。
