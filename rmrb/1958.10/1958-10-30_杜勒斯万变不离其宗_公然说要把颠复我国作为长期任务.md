Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference on the 28th, attempted to downplay the significance of the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea and reiterated that the U.S. invading forces would continue to remain in South Korea.

In response to a reporter's question as to whether the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea was "a significant event," Dulles said that his impression was that "this withdrawal is only to the other side of the Yalu River, so they can quickly be redeployed back to Korea," while if the U.S. invading forces were to withdraw, "it would not be a matter of withdrawing fifty miles, but a distance of ten thousand miles." In presenting this absurd reason to defend the U.S. refusal to withdraw its troops, Dulles was evidently unable to answer questions frequently raised by world opinion: Why did the U.S. invading forces come ten thousand miles to occupy South Korea, and why are they unwilling to leave and let the Koreans solve their own problems? What reason is there for the American troops, who came ten thousand miles, not to withdraw more quickly?

Dulles also said, "The mission of the United Nations forces in Korea, in which the United States participates, has not yet been completed, which is to achieve the reunification of Korea under free elections. I do not think the current situation is suitable for taking an action to withdraw all our troops." These remarks show that the United States still insists on completing its "mission" of turning Korea into a U.S. colony and war base, through the means of so-called "free elections under United Nations supervision."

A reporter pointed out to Dulles that Chiang Kai-shek's "ambassador" to the United States, Yeh Kung-chao, had stated that the Chiang Kai-shek group's "abandonment of force is not unconditional," and asked him to comment. In response, Dulles deliberately exaggerated the statement in the Taipei Communiqué regarding the so-called "non-use of force against the mainland" as being of "extremely great significance" for the future. However, he avoided explaining what this "significance" was, avoiding publicly stating the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas." He said, "The important significance of this statement lies in the fact that it involves a new statement about the mission of the Free China Government (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group). It is important to emphasize winning through peaceful means rather than trying to win by force."

Dulles once again publicly stated that the U.S. government believes that Chiang Kai-shek's "counterattack against the mainland is hopeless" and indicated that the work of subverting the People's Republic of China should be placed on a long-term basis. He said: "If you wish, you could say that in any case, their (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) chances of winning by force are slim; therefore, it is meaningless. Making this new public statement is of extremely great significance. I think this will shift the emphasis, placing their mission on a long-term basis that will be full of great significance for the future." Dulles then said, "I do not want to discuss every possible hypothesis for the future, nor do I want to say whether the possibility of using force has been completely ruled out." This once again confirms that the U.S. authorities want to reserve the option of attacking China by force at an appropriate time.

Dulles denied that there was "any secret agreement" with Chiang Kai-shek regarding the reduction of Chiang's troops on Kinmen. He also said, "How the military resources of the Republic of China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek group) can be used to the greatest advantage has been and will continue to be studied. This study is conducted entirely from a military point of view. At least in the current situation, this will be purely a military judgment."

In his talk, Dulles also gesticulated and commented that the practice of on-and-off shelling, half-stopping and half-shelling, announced in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's second letter to Taiwanese compatriots was "unprecedented," "bizarre," and "uncivilized." He said that doing so was "not for military purposes" but "only for political purposes" and so-called "saving face."

Dulles said, "There is no doubt whatsoever: their (referring to the Chinese side) real target in this matter is not Kinmen and Matsu but Taiwan itself." He continued, "They will at least for a period concentrate on propaganda efforts, the purpose of which is to try to make the residents of Taiwan not cooperate with the Americans."

    杜勒斯万变不离其宗
    公然说要把颠复我国作为长期任务
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯28日在记者招待会上力图贬低中国人民志愿军全部撤离朝鲜的重大意义，并且再次表示美国侵略军将继续赖在南朝鲜不走。
    在答复记者关于中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜“是不是一件意义重大的事件”的问题时，杜勒斯说，他的印象是“这次撤退只是撤到鸭绿江对面而已，因此以后还可以很快地重新调回朝鲜”，而美国侵略军如果要撤退，“那就不是撤退五十英里的问题，而是要撤退一万英里这样一个距离”，杜勒斯在提出这荒唐的理由为美国拒绝撤军辩护时，显然无法回答世界舆论经常提出的这样一些问题：美国侵略军为什么要不远一万英里来占领南朝鲜，而不愿走开让朝鲜人来解决他们自己的问题？不远一万英里而来的美国军队，又有什么理由不应当更快地撤走？
    杜勒斯又说，“有美国参加的联合国部队到朝鲜执行的任务现在还没有完成，那就是在自由选举的条件下实现朝鲜的重新统一。我认为现在的形势不适宜于采取把我们的部队全部撤出这样一种行动。”他这番话表明，美国仍然坚持要完成它把朝鲜变成美国殖民地和战争基地的“任务”，其手段就是所谓“在联合国监督下举行自由选举”。
    有记者向杜勒斯指出，蒋介石驻美“大使”叶公超曾经表示蒋介石集团“放弃武力并不是无条件的”，要求他发表意见。杜勒斯在回答时故意渲染台北公报中关于所谓“不使用武力进攻大陆”的提法对于将来“有极重大的意义”。但是，他又避免说明这个“意义”究竟何在，避免公开说出美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他说，“这项声明的重要意义在于，这牵涉到关于自由中国政府（即蒋介石集团）的使命的一种新的提法。重要的是，强调通过和平途径取胜而不是凭借武力设法取胜。”
    杜勒斯再一次公开申明美国政府认为蒋介石“反攻大陆无望”，并且表示要把颠复中华人民共和国的工作放在长期的基础上。他说：“如果你愿意的话，你可以说，在任何情况下，他们（指蒋介石集团）用武力来取胜的希望不大；因此这是没有意义的。作这种新的公开的提法是有极重大的意义的。我认为，这将使重点转移，把他们的使命安放在一个对于将来将充满重大意义的长期基础上。”杜勒斯接着说，“我不想讨论今后的每一种可能的假设，也不想说是否已经完全排除了使用武力的可能性。”这就再次证实了美国当局要保留在适当时机以武力进攻中国的余地。
    杜勒斯否认同蒋介石在减少金门蒋军方面有“任何密约”。他又说，“对中华民国（即蒋介石集团）的军事资源如何能够作最大程度的有利使用已经作了并且将不断地进行研究。这种研究完全是在军事方面进行的。至少在目前的情况下，这将纯粹是一种军事判断。”
    杜勒斯在谈话中还指手划脚地评论中国国防部再告台湾同胞书宣布的打打停停、半停半打的做法是“没有先例的”、“离奇的”、“不文明的”。他说这样做“并不是为了军事上的目的”，而“只是为了政治上的目的”和所谓“挽回面子”。
    杜勒斯说，“丝毫不容怀疑：他们（指中国方面）在这件事情中真正的目标并不是金门和马祖而是台湾本身。”他接着说，“他们至少要在一个时期内集中力量进行宣传工作，其目的在于设法使台湾居民不跟美国人合作。”
