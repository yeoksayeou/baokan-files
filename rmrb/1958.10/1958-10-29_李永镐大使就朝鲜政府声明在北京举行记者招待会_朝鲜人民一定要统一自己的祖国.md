Xinhua News Agency, October 28th. Li Yong-ho, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, held a press conference in Beijing this evening regarding a statement issued the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho introduced the full content of the statement at the press conference. He said that the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who are faithful to their international obligations and have always been concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, has opened up a new situation for easing tensions in Korea and promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho pointed out that the most important issue currently is the immediate withdrawal of U.S. imperialist troops from South Korea. Because of the occupation of South Korea by the U.S. aggressive troops, the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea has not been resolved. The people of South Korea are now in dire straits, and the Korean nation is suffering a great disaster.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho emphasized that Korea is the Korea of the Korean people, and no one can divide it. The Korean people must build their fatherland into a unified, autonomous, and independent country.

    朝鲜人民一定要统一自己的祖国
    新华社28日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使李永镐，今天晚间就朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发布关于中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜的声明，在北京举行记者招待会。
    李永镐大使在招待会上介绍了声明的全部内容，他说，忠实于国际义务、一直关心朝鲜问题和平解决的中国人民志愿军全部撤出朝鲜，为缓和朝鲜的紧张局势，促进朝鲜问题的和平解决，打开了新的局面。
    李永镐大使指出，当前最重要的问题是美帝国主义军队立即撤出南朝鲜。由于美国侵略军队强占南朝鲜，因此使朝鲜和平统一问题一直没有解决。南朝鲜人民现在正处于水深火热中，朝鲜民族正遭受巨大的灾难。
    李永镐大使强调说，朝鲜是朝鲜人民的朝鲜，任何人也不能把它分裂开，朝鲜人民一定要把自己的祖国建设成统一的、自主和独立的国家。
