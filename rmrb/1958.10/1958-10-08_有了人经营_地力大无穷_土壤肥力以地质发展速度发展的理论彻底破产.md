    With Human Management, the Power of the Land is Limitless
    The Theory of Soil Fertility Developing at the Speed of Geological Development is Thoroughly Bankrupt
    Ye Hecai
    No one has ever doubted the role of soil in the process of crop growth and development. The meaning of the concept of soil fertility has been continuously enriched and improved with the development of production. This meaning is of utmost importance to people's understanding and improvement of soil. Today, in the context of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, people's understanding of the development speed of soil fertility is of even greater significance.
    Historically, there have been various understandings of the concept of soil fertility development. In the past, there were schools of soil geology and soil agricultural chemistry. The school of soil geology viewed soil and its fertility from the perspective of the rocks that formed the soil and the weathered rock remains, believing that soil fertility developed at the speed of geological development. The school of soil agricultural chemistry regarded soil as a warehouse for storing nutrients and believed that the development of soil fertility was mainly determined by the amount of fertilizer applied. These two schools of thought have gone astray.
    Marx pointed out long ago that the concept of soil fertility includes the role of human and socio-economic factors; the role of human factors increases with the development of society. Especially in socialist society, in our country's current Great Leap Forward where one day equals twenty years, why can't the development of soil fertility be accelerated? The reason it can be improved quickly is precisely because the potential of soil fertility is great. The excavation of potential soil fertility is a major gain from the Party's call to break superstitions and engage in technical revolution.

    有了人经营　地力大无穷
    土壤肥力以地质发展速度发展的理论彻底破产

    土壤在作物生长发育过程中的作用，从来没有人怀疑过。关于土壤肥力概念的含义，是随着生产的发展不断丰富和提高的。这种含义对于人们认识土壤和改良土壤有着极其重要的意义。今天，在农业生产大跃进形势下，人们对土壤肥力发展速度的认识就具有更重大的意义。
    对土壤肥力发展的概念，历史上有过各种各样的了解。过去有过土壤地质学派和土壤农业化学派等派别。土壤地质学派从形成土壤的那些岩石和岩石风化残体的角度来看土壤和它的肥力，认为土壤肥力是以地质发展的速度发展的，土壤农业化学派把土壤看作储存养料的仓库，把土壤肥力的发展看作是主要依靠施肥的数量来决定的。这两种学派的看法，是走错了路的。
    马克思早就提出，在土壤肥力的概念中包括人为因素和社会经济因素的作用；人为因素的作用是随着社会的发展而加大的。特别是在社会主义社会里，在我国当前一天等于二十年的大跃进中，为什么土壤肥力的发展不能加速呢？所以能够很快提高，正是因为土壤肥力的潜力很大。土壤潜在肥力被挖掘出来是党提出破除迷信、大搞技术革命的一大收获。
