Xinhua News Agency, October 24th, Taipei dispatch: According to a report by United Press International, shortly after the conclusion of the US-Chiang talks on the 23rd, Chiang Kai-shek's "Foreign Minister" Huang Shao-gu immediately met with a reporter from this news agency to express the Chiang Kai-shek group's interpretation of the communiqué. At that time, Dulles had not yet left Taipei. Dulles made Chiang Kai-shek "guarantee not to use force to attack the mainland" in the communiqué. Huang Shao-gu, in explaining the communiqué to the reporter, emphasized that Chiang Kai-shek still "reserved" the "right to use force" in the event of a so-called "rebellion" on the mainland.

In the same news report on Huang Shao-gu's remarks, United Press International stated that the United States itself hoped to create "rebellion" on the mainland. However, the news said that Dulles recently "avoided making any remarks that could be interpreted as supporting the Kuomintang's attack on the mainland in the event of a rebellion." Dulles said at a press conference in Washington on September 30th that "it cannot be assumed" that this situation "would lead to Chiang Kai-shek returning to his hometown."

On the same day the US-Chiang talks concluded, the "China News," published by the Chiang Kai-shek group, said that the United States "will soon" resume "escorting" Chiang's troops, and the "ships" the United States planned to use for "escorting" "have been recalled to the Taiwan Strait."

A spokesman for the US military command in Taiwan immediately denied this statement. He said that "as far as we know, the situation is not so" regarding the point that US "escort" ships have been recalled. He also said that "escorting" would only resume when it was "militarily necessary."

Xinhua News Agency, October 24th, London dispatch: The British "Daily Mail" published a report on the 23rd by its Taipei correspondent, discussing some of the differences in the talks between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek. The report said that the US-Chiang talks had "reached a deadlock." It is said that when Dulles asked Chiang Kai-shek about withdrawing his troops from the coastal islands, Chiang Kai-shek replied, "I will not withdraw troops while I am alive." Dulles also "tested" Chiang Kai-shek's reaction to the recent policy decisions made by the United States, "which are said to include neutralizing Jinmen and Mazu and possibly reducing the troops there." "Chiang Kai-shek categorically rejected these two opinions." The "Daily Mail" reporter said that Dulles, who was originally scheduled to leave Taipei on the 22nd, postponed his departure date due to this situation in order to "re-discuss this issue" with Chiang Kai-shek. The "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Taipei also reported on the 22nd that "Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek clashed in the talks." It is said that "there was also a dispute over the obligation of US warships to carry out escort activities."

### 一项会谈公报　解释各有不同  美蒋会谈并未消除双方分歧

    一项会谈公报　解释各有不同
    美蒋会谈并未消除双方分歧
    新华社24日讯　台北消息：据合众国际社报道，在23日美蒋会谈结束以后不久，蒋介石集团“外交部长”黄少谷马上就接见这个通讯社记者，表明蒋介石集团对会谈公报的解释。那时杜勒斯尚未离开台北，杜勒斯使蒋介石在会谈公报中“保证不使用武力进攻大陆”。黄少谷在解释公报时对这个记者强调，蒋介石仍然“保留”一旦在大陆发生所谓“叛乱”时“使用武力的权利”。
    合众国际社在报道黄少谷谈话的同一条消息里表明，美国自己是指望在大陆上制造“叛乱”的，但是，消息说，杜勒斯最近“曾经避免发表任何可能被解释为赞成国民党在大陆发生叛乱时进攻大陆的谈话”，杜勒斯9月30日在华盛顿记者招待会上曾说过，“不能假定”在出现这种情况时“会导致蒋介石回老家”。
    在美蒋会谈结束的同一天，蒋介石集团出版的“中国新闻”说，美国“不久将”恢复给蒋军“护航”，美国准备用来“护航”的“舰只已被召回台湾海峡”。
    侵台美军司令部发言人马上出来否认这种说法。他说，关于美国“护航”舰只已经召回一点，“据我们所知，情况不是如此”。他又说，要到“在军事上有必要时”，才会恢复“护航”。
    新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：英国“每日邮报”23日刊载该报驻台北记者的一篇报道，谈到杜勒斯同蒋介石会谈中某些分歧。这篇报道说，美蒋会谈曾经“陷入僵局”，据说，杜勒斯问到蒋介石关于从沿海岛屿撤出他的驻军问题，蒋介石回答说，“在我活着的时候不会撤军”。杜勒斯还“试验了”蒋介石对美国最近作出的政策决定的反应，“据说这些决定包括使金门和马祖中立化以及可能减少那里的驻军”，“蒋介石断然拒绝了这两个意见”。“每日邮报”记者说，原定在22日离开台北的杜勒斯，由于碰到这种情况，因而推迟了他离开的日期，以同蒋介石再“重新讨论这个问题”。“每日电讯报”驻台北记者22日也报道，“杜勒斯和蒋介石在会谈中发生冲突”，据说，在美国军舰承担“关于进行护航活动的义务上，也发生了争执”。
