    The Whole People Mobilize to Increase Power Production and Conserve Electricity
    Factories, Mines, and Government Organizations in Liaoning Set Up Their Own Power Stations
    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to ensure the completion of this year's great leap forward in industrial production, Liaoning Province has launched an industrial "anti-drought" movement of nationwide electricity conservation and power station construction. This "anti-drought" movement, like the industrial "anti-drought" movement that has already achieved great results in overcoming raw material difficulties, is a major measure to strive for a bumper harvest in industrial production.
    At present, the power supply in Liaoning Province is very tight. On the one hand, this is because the great leap forward in industry has led to a sharp increase in the demand for electricity, and the development of the power industry cannot keep up with the demand; on the other hand, it is because Liaoning Province has been suffering from drought this year, and the water level of hydropower stations has been declining, greatly reducing the source of hydropower. A few factories and mines have been unable to maintain normal production due to insufficient power. Since August 11, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has repeatedly issued instructions and held emergency meetings to mobilize the people of the province to launch a mass movement to conserve and generate electricity in order to overcome the difficulties of insufficient power.
    Now, all regions and units in the province have taken action. Dalian City saved more than 27 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first half of the year; now it has set a goal of saving 10% to 15% of electricity. Shenyang, Fushun, Benxi and other cities have also formulated specific measures to save a lot of electricity.
    The workers of many factories and mines have taken the lead in attacking the phenomenon of wasting electricity. The phenomena of driving empty cars and equipment leakage that often occurred in the past have been reduced, and the wattage of lighting lamps for production and life has also been reduced. The purpose of saving electricity is to do everything possible to ensure the needs of production. Many factory workers have put forward the fighting slogan of "use less electricity and produce more." They learn from advanced experience, improve operating techniques, and combine technological revolution with electricity conservation. The workers of the steelmaking workshop of the Dalian Steel Plant improved the operating methods, increased the charging capacity of the electric furnace, and accelerated the melting time. Each month, they can not only save more than 1.1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, but also increase the production of more than 1,400 tons of steel. Shenyang Cable Factory conscientiously promotes advanced experience and reduces power consumption, which can save 25% of electricity and ensure production needs.
    While saving electricity, many factories, mines, government agencies, schools, and troops have also adopted the method of self-reliance to generate electricity on their own. By September 29, Dalian City alone had built power stations with a power generation capacity of 10,055 kilowatts. Some idle diesel engines, steam engines, and dilapidated generators have been put to use. Shenyang Electric Power School repaired dilapidated generators and built a thermal power plant in more than 20 days, which can meet the electricity needs of the entire school. The broad masses of the people dared to think and dare to act, and came up with many ways to manufacture power generation equipment and solve power problems. In order to build a small power station, the Twelfth Factory of the Fuxin Mining Bureau used its only few small machine tools to make a steam turbine generator. Young workers at the Dalian Petroleum Seventh Factory built four small hydropower stations using industrial wastewater. Fushun Longfeng Mine also successfully generated electricity using natural gas. This mine has built its own gas power station to supply the electricity needed for coal mining. Some counties and townships have also started to use various local power sources (river water, tides, wind, biogas, etc.) to build small power stations. Xifeng County built 14 small power stations in one month. (Attached picture)

    全民动手　增产电力　节约用电
    辽宁厂矿机关自办电站
    本报讯　辽宁省为了保证完成今年工业生产跃进计划，掀起了一个全民节约用电和兴办电站的工业“抗旱”运动。这个“抗旱”运动，和已经获得巨大成果的战胜原材料困难的工业“抗旱”运动一样，是争取工业生产大丰收的重大措施。
    目前，辽宁省电力供应十分紧张。这一方面是因为工业大跃进，对于电力的需要猛然增加，而电力工业的发展赶不上需要；另一方面是因为今年辽宁省天旱，水电站的水位一直下降，使水电的来源大大减少。少数厂矿因为电力不足，已经不能维持正常生产。中共辽宁省委从8月11日起，一再发布指示，召开紧急会议，动员全省人民展开节电、办电的群众运动，来战胜电力不足的困难。
    现在，全省各个地区各个单位都已经行动起来。旅大市上半年节省电力二千七百多万度；现在又提出了节约用电10％到15％的奋斗目标。沈阳、抚顺、本溪等市也制定具体措施，大量节省电力。
    许多厂矿的职工都一马当先，向浪费电力的现象进攻。过去经常出现的开空车、设备漏电等现象减少了，生产和生活用的照明电灯也在改小度数。节约用电的目的，是尽力保证生产需要。不少工厂的职工提出了“少用电，多增产”的战斗口号。他们学习先进经验，改进操作技术，把技术革命和节约用电结合起来。大连钢厂炼钢车间职工改进操作方法，提高电炉装入量，加快熔化时间，每个月不但能节约一百一十多万度电，还能增产一千四百多吨钢。沈阳电缆厂认真推广先进经验，降低耗电量，可以节约电力25％，保证了生产需要。
    在节约用电的同时，许多厂矿、机关、学校和部队还采取自力更生的办法，自搞发电。仅旅大市到9月29日止，已经办起的电站发电能力就达一万零五十五瓩。一些单位闲置未用的柴油机、蒸气机和破旧的发电机，被利用起来了。沈阳电力学校修复破旧的发电机，用二十多天建成了一座火力发电站，可以满足全校用电的要求。广大群众敢想敢干，想了许多办法制造发电设备，解决动力问题。阜新矿务局十二厂为了办小电站，利用自己仅有的几台小机床制成了汽轮发电机。旅大石油七厂青年工人利用工业废水建成四座小水电站。抚顺龙凤矿还利用天然瓦斯发电成功。这个矿已经自建瓦斯发电站，供应采煤的电力需要。有些县、乡也着手利用当地的各种动力（河水、海潮、风力、沼气等），建立小型发电站。西丰县一个月就建成小型电站十四座。（附图片）
