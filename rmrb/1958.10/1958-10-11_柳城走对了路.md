    Liucheng Took the Right Path

    At present, the steel front in many places is still facing many difficulties. One of the main difficulties is that the coal supply is still not keeping up. Relying on external assistance is certainly not feasible; we must rely on our own efforts and solve the problem locally. The solution is to adopt the small-scale, indigenous, mass movement approach, building small coal kilns on a large scale, engaging in indigenous coal mining methods on a large scale, and especially launching mass movements on a large scale. Liucheng County took this path. The county party committee organized a county-wide debate and extensive propaganda campaign, raised the red flag high, and then organized an army of 100,000 to open mountains and split ridges. They took the right path, and as a result, their daily output was equivalent to a year's output. This path is also the path that those in other places who are running the steel industry should take.

    柳城走对了路
    眼前许多地方的钢铁战线还面临着不少困难。其中主要困难之一，便是煤的供应还跟不上。靠外援当然不行，必须自力更生，就地解决。办法就是采取小土群方针，大建小煤窑，大搞土法采煤，特别是要大搞群众运动。柳城县便是走的这条路子。县委组织了全党全民大辩论，大宣传，高插起红旗，然后组织了十万野战大军开山劈岭。他们走对了，因此，一天的产量竟能抵得上一年的产量。这条路，也是其他地方办钢铁工业者应走的路。
