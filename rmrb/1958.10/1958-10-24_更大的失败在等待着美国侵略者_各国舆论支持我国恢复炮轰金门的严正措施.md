Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 23rd - The Mongolian "Truth Daily" today published a commentary on the Chinese Ministry of National Defense's order to resume the bombardment of Jinmen, stating that the Mongolian public considers this measure taken by the Chinese government to be just and reasonable. The Mongolian people fully support this measure.

The commentary stated that China has every right to take measures it deems appropriate to safeguard the integrity of its territorial sovereignty. The commentary pointed out that the continuous violation of China's airspace and territorial waters by American military aircraft and warships is a blatant act of blatant interference in China's internal affairs. The commentary said that liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. This issue should be handled by the Chinese people themselves, and the United States has no right to interfere in China's internal affairs. If American imperialism continues to interfere in China's internal affairs and dares to launch a new war, then the strength of the socialist camp will deal it a fatal blow.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - The "Free Romania Daily" today, in an article commenting on our Ministry of National Defense's order to resume the bombardment of Jinmen, pointed out that the escort of American warships violated the conditions for stopping the bombardment of Jinmen. In order to punish the provocation, the Chinese side had to start the bombardment again.

The article said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique rejected China's proposal to resolve the issue through peaceful negotiations. The article pointed out that the United States continues to ship missiles to Taiwan, and American warships continue to violate China's territorial waters, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek and the United States want to restore their rule in China through war. And Dulles' visit to Taiwan is to further interfere in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 22nd - Damascus newspapers today, in commenting on China's resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen, have expressed condemnation of American provocations.

　　"Baghdad Daily" said that the people of Arab countries today stand on the side of the People's China and firmly support its actions to recover its islands.

The newspaper condemned American war provocations and Dulles' trip to Taiwan. It said that only the United States is responsible for the serious consequences of this situation that could cause great harm to the whole world.

The newspaper pointed out that the United States' policy based on conspiracies and its aggression in the Far East will inevitably be defeated, just as it has been defeated in the Middle East. It will be defeated in the face of the will of the great Chinese people.

　　"Today Daily" published an editorial saying that the United States, on the Taiwan issue, sometimes puts on the guise of a dove, pretending to demand "peace," and sometimes insists on establishing atomic bases and supplying the Chiang Kai-shek clique with various weapons. However, in fact, Chiang Kai-shek will eventually become a scapegoat.

The newspaper said that if the United States ignores the unanimous warnings of the Eastern countries that hope to maintain peace and attempts to take risks in the East, then it will suffer greater defeat, setbacks, and gain a worse reputation, just like the fate it has suffered in recent years when it has played conspiracies and taken various risks.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 22nd - The Iraqi "National Daily" today published an editorial on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen, saying that China has every right to resume the bombardment of the coastal islands.

The editorial said that China recently stopped the bombardment on the necessary condition that American ships do not escort Chiang Kai-shek's ships, so that civilians have the opportunity to obtain food supplies without American interference. It pointed out that the United States, however, continues to violate China's territorial waters.

The newspaper said that China has warned the United States that stopping the bombardment is not out of weakness, but only out of humanitarian considerations. The newspaper specifically pointed out that China had caused the United States to suffer a heavy defeat in Korea.

Baghdad's "Republic Daily" published a commentary on the same day saying that while China is striving to resolve the issue of Taiwan and the coastal islands by peaceful means, Dulles is doing everything possible to aggravate the tense situation and complicate the issue based on his "brink of war" policy.

The newspaper pointed out that China's policy is winning it new friends and supporters every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd - "People's Daily" today published an editorial refuting Dulles' absurd statement on China's resumption of the bombardment of Jinmen.

The editorial said that Dulles' tone is different from that of the people all over the world. The newspaper said that it is very clear that it is the United States that has occupied Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu and has wantonly violated China's territorial waters, but Dulles actually said: "The Chinese Communists are bellicose."

The editorial said that Dulles should remember that those who like to jump are most likely to break their legs.

The newspaper also said that China has issued thirty-seven warnings to American warships for violating China's territorial waters. We still don't know how long Eisenhower and Dulles' armed forces will continue to do this. It said that Dulles' foreign policy is indeed crazy.

    更大的失败在等待着美国侵略者
    各国舆论支持我国恢复炮轰金门的严正措施
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古“真理报”今天就中国国防部发布命令恢复炮击金门一事发表评论说，蒙古公众认为中国政府采取的这一措施是正义的和合理的。蒙古人民完全支持这个措施。
    评论说，中国为了维护领土主权的完整完全有权采取它认为适当的措施。评论指出，美国军用飞机和军舰连续不断地侵犯中国的领空和领海是明目张胆的干涉中国内政的粗暴行为。评论说，解放台湾是中国的内政问题。这个问题应当由中国人民自己来处理，美国没有任何权利干涉中国的内政。如果美帝国主义继续干涉中国的内政并胆敢发动新战争，那么，社会主义阵营的力量将给它以致命的打击。
    新华社布加勒斯特22日电“自由罗马尼亚报”今天在一篇评我国国防部恢复炮击金门的命令的文章中指出，美国军舰的护航破坏了停止炮击金门的条件。为了惩罚挑衅，中国方面不得不再开始炮击。
    文章说，蒋介石集团拒绝了中国关于用和平谈判的方式来解决问题的建议。文章指出，美国继续运导弹到台湾，美国军舰继续侵犯中国的领海，这说明蒋介石和美国想通过战争来恢复他们在中国的统治。而杜勒斯到台湾去是为了进一步干涉中国的内政。
    新华社大马士革22日电　大马士革报纸今天在评论中国恢复炮击金门这件事时，纷纷表示谴责美国挑衅。
      “巴格达报”说，阿拉伯各国人民今天都站在人民中国这一边，并且坚决支持它收复它的岛屿的行动。
    这家报纸谴责美国的战争挑衅和杜勒斯的台湾之行。它说，只有美国要对这种会使全世界遭受重大损害的局势所产生的严重后果负责。
    这家报纸指出，美国以阴谋诡计为基础的政策以及它在远东的侵略必将遭到失败，正如它在中东已经遭到失败一样。它将在伟大的中国人民的意志面前遭到失败。
      “今天报”发表社论说，美国在台湾问题上一会儿披上鸽子的外衣，装作要求“和平”，一会儿又坚持建立原子基地，向蒋介石集团供应各种武器，然而事实上，蒋介石最后将成为一只替罪的羔羊。
    这家报纸说，如果美国不顾希望维护和平的东方各国人民的一致警告，企图在东方进行冒险，那么它将同它在近几年来玩弄阴谋诡计和进行各种冒险时所遭到过的命运一样，遭到更大的失败、挫折和得到更坏的名声。
    新华社巴格达22日电　伊拉克“国家报”今天就中国人民解放军恢复炮击金门一事发表社论说，中国有一切权利恢复对沿海岛屿的炮击。
    社论说，中国最近停止炮击是以美国舰只不给蒋介石船只护航为必要条件，以使平民在没有美国干涉的情况下，有机会得到粮食供应品。它指出，但是美国却继续侵犯中国的领海。
    这家报纸说，中国已经警告美国，停止炮击并不是出于软弱，而仅仅是出于人道主义考虑。这家报纸特别指出，中国在朝鲜曾经使美国遭到了惨重的失败。
    巴格达“共和国报”同一天发表的评论说，在中国努力以和平方法解决台湾和沿海岛屿的问题的时候，杜勒斯却根据他的“战争边缘”政策千方百计地加剧紧张局势，并且使问题复杂化。
    报纸指出，中国的政策使它一天天赢得新的朋友和支持者。
    新华社雅加达22日电　“人民日报”今天发表社论驳斥杜勒斯就中国恢复炮击金门一事发表的荒谬声明。
    社论说，杜勒斯的调子同全世界人民的语气不一样。这家报纸说，事情十分明显，那是美国霸占了台湾、金门和马祖并且专横地侵犯中国的领海，可是，杜勒斯竟说：“中国共产党人好战”。
    社论说，杜勒斯应当记住，喜欢跳的人最容易摔断腿。
    这家报纸又说，中国已经对美国军舰侵犯中国领海提出了三十七次警告。我们还不知道，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的武装部队像这样干下去要多久。它说，杜勒斯的外交政策确实是疯狂的。
