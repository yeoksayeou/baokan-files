    Zhejiang's steel production more than triples
    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th) Zhejiang Province's more than three million strong army of steelworkers produced 2,624 tons of pig iron and 60 tons of steel in 24 hours on the 29th, more than tripling the output of the 28th. Jinhua Prefecture had the highest increase, from more than 72 tons on the 28th to more than 700 tons. Qingtian County in Wenzhou Prefecture increased its daily output from 20 tons to 215 tons.
    On the 29th, more than three million steel warriors were mobilized throughout the province, with more than 18,000 native-style blast furnaces and small blast furnaces for iron smelting. In Longjing Township, West Lake People's Commune, Hangzhou, famous for its Longjing tea, more than 200 tea farmers and tea-picking girls overcame the difficulty of not having a blower and used rice threshers and bicycles to drive the bellows, enabling 15 native-style furnaces to produce more than two tons of pig iron. The campuses of major universities and middle schools in Hangzhou were filled with red-hot native-style furnace clusters. Qian Jun, Deputy Commander of the Zhejiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the vast number of officers and soldiers worked together to produce molten iron. More than 5,000 medical personnel in Hangzhou were also assigned to the native-style furnace clusters to provide medical care while smelting iron. Zhao Mai, President of Hangzhou First Hospital, served as the furnace leader, and the furnace produced more than 1,000 jin of iron on that day. The steel logistics labor army throughout the province also worked day and night to transport ore and coke.
