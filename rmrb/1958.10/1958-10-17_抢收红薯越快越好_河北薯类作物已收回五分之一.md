Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 15th: Hebei Province is currently rushing to harvest and transport potato crops. As of the 12th, the province had dug up more than 4.93 million mu of potato crops, accounting for over one-fifth of the sown area. The Zhangjiakou Special District, which experiences early frosts, has basically completed the harvest of its 2.4 million mu of potatoes. The Baoding Special District has harvested 1 million mu out of its 1.4 million mu of spring potatoes and has already sliced and stored 600,000 mu of spring potatoes. According to statistics from just four counties in the Tangshan Special District, 440 million jin of potato blocks have been stored in cellars, and 100 million jin of potato slices have been produced. Lulong County has adopted the method of "collecting on the spot, slicing on the spot, drying on the spot, and storing on the spot." Generally, in a sweet potato field of about ten mu, an area of about two mu is selected and leveled with sand to serve as a site, and several "wind storage" areas are set up. This can greatly save labor, avoid losses, and speed up the process.

This year, Hebei Province has planted more than 24 million mu of potato crops, with an estimated total output of over 19.3 billion jin (converted to grain equivalent, same below), an increase of more than 5.6 times compared to last year; the yield per mu is expected to reach 799.8 jin, an increase of more than 1.1 times compared to last year. Based on the characteristics of this year's potato crops – large area, large quantity, tight harvesting and transportation, and easy spoilage – various regions have generally paid attention to making preparations for digging, storage, and other tasks in advance. The province has trained more than 880,000 technical personnel in sweet potato storage, processing, and consumption, rushed to manufacture more than 300,000 slicers, and newly dug and expanded more than 1.09 million cellars and wells. Since late September, various regions have also been appropriately adjusting their efforts to focus on potato work without interfering with other tasks. All potato crops will be harvested before the end of October.

    抢收红薯越快越好
    河北薯类作物已收回五分之一
    新华社天津15日电　河北省各地正在抢收抢运薯类作物。到12日止，全省已刨收薯类作物四百九十三万多亩，占播种面积的五分之一强。降霜较早的张家口专区二百四十万亩马铃薯，已经基本收完。保定专区的一百四十万亩春薯，已收完一百万亩，并且已把六十万亩春薯切片运回贮藏起来。唐山专区仅四个县的统计，已把四亿四千万斤薯块收藏在窖里，切成的薯片有一亿斤。卢龙县采取了“就地收、就地切、就地晒、就地入囤”的办法，一般是在十亩大小的薯地里，选出方圆约二亩的地方轧平铺沙，作为场地，搭起几个“风囤”。这样，可以大大节省劳力，避免损失，加快速度。
    河北省今年播种的二千四百多万亩薯类作物，预计总产量可达一百九十三亿多斤（折粮数，下同），比去年增加五点六倍多；亩产量可达七百九十九点八斤，比去年增产一点一倍以上。各地根据今年薯类作物面积大、数量多、收运紧张、容易烂坏等特点，普遍注意事先做好刨收、保管等准备工作。全省共训练了甘薯保管、加工、食用技术人员八十八万多人，赶制出三十万多台切片机具，新挖和扩修窖、井一百零九万多个。从9月下旬以来，各地又在不误其他工作的情况下，适当调剂力量抓紧薯类工作。全部薯类作物将在10月底以前收完。
