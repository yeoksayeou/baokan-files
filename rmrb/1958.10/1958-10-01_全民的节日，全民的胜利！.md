    A National Holiday, A National Victory!
    Today marks the ninth anniversary of the founding of our great nation – the People's Republic of China. From Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, from the Pamir Plateau to the East Sea, from cities to the countryside, the whole country is rejoicing and celebrating this great national holiday!
    In celebrating this year's National Day, our people are more jubilant than in any previous year. Because under the wise leadership of the Party, through tremendous efforts over the past year, our people have achieved brilliant and comprehensive victories on all fronts, and our socialist construction is advancing at an unprecedented high speed.
    The past year has been one of great changes in China's economic situation, changes that began in the later stages of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle. The decisive victory of the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle has greatly liberated China's social productive forces and vigorously developed China's economy. The changes in the economic situation over the past year began first in agriculture, followed by the leap forward in agriculture, which promoted the leap forward in industry, thereby also promoting the development of commerce and transportation. A prominent feature of this year's great leap forward in economic construction is the simultaneous emphasis on industry and agriculture, both advancing at an unprecedented scale and speed. In terms of industrial production, due to the implementation of the central policy of simultaneously developing central and local enterprises, and simultaneously developing large and medium-small enterprises, that is, implementing a policy of industrial development by the whole people, there has been a monthly increase since the beginning of this year. The total output value of industry and handicrafts from January to August increased by 47% compared to the same period last year, with the total output value in August doubling compared to the same period last year. Currently, the people of the whole country are exerting their utmost efforts to respond to the Party Central Committee's great call to double steel production and striving to achieve the production of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. A mass movement climax of industrial development by the whole people, taking steel as the key link, is developing. On the eve of National Day, good news from the steel front came from all over the country, indicating that the task of doubling steel production this year will definitely be completed. It is expected that the total output value of industry and handicrafts this year will increase by more than 60% compared to last year. This high speed greatly exceeds the average annual growth rate (19.2%) and the highest annual growth rate (33%) during the First Five-Year Plan period, and is also unprecedented in capitalist countries. Judging from the situation of this year's great leap forward in industry, the time required for China to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in industry will be greatly shortened compared to the original estimate. In terms of agricultural production, this year, thanks to the mobilization of the soaring enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, large-scale water conservancy projects, fertilizer accumulation, deep plowing and soil improvement, close planting, improved seeds, and other effective field management measures were carried out. Not only did "satellite" fields with high-yield harvests emerge, which played a great role in breaking superstitions, liberating minds, and accumulating farming experience, but also large-scale bumper harvests of various crops were achieved. It is expected that this year's grain output will double compared to last year, reaching more than 700 billion catties, and cotton will also increase by more than double, reaching 70 million dan. Other oil crops, tobacco, and tea will also have bumper harvests. Such large-scale high-speed increases in production are unprecedented not only in Chinese history but also in world history. It is particularly worth pointing out that China's agricultural production this year has increased without a large amount of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers. China's great leap forward in agriculture has extremely important significance in economic, political, theoretical, and agricultural science aspects. Many provinces, after this year's arduous struggle, can complete the main targets of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; China's food problem has been basically solved; all bourgeois doctrines such as agricultural backwardness theory, agricultural slow progress theory, the law of diminishing returns of land, and Malthusian population theory, as well as all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas, have been completely bankrupted in the face of ironclad facts; many new creations in agricultural cultivation techniques in China this year have provided rich and extremely valuable experience for agricultural science. This year, China's transportation and commerce have also made great progress, playing a significant role in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. In particular, the great improvement in the service attitude of commercial staff has been unanimously praised by the broad masses of the people. The great leap forward in China's industry and agriculture vividly proves that liberated productive forces can leap forward at a speed that people could not have dreamed of in the past; people who have been liberated not only economically and politically but also ideologically have broken through all historical conventions and created miracles in the world.
    With the economic front leaping forward, this year China's culture, education, science and technology, literature and art have also seen a great leap forward. China has begun to enter a new era of technological revolution and cultural revolution. In terms of education, great progress has been made in the nationwide literacy campaign. What was previously thought to take ten years or more to complete, now seems to be achievable in at most two or three years, with 67% of counties and cities having basically eliminated illiteracy this year. Primary school education has been basically universalized throughout the country in a very short period of time, with more than 93% of school-age children already enrolled. The number of secondary school students has increased by about double compared to last year, and agricultural middle schools have greatly developed. The number of universities and colleges has increased by four to five times compared to last year, and the number of students has increased by more than 60%. In addition, there has been a great increase in various spare-time schools. The rapid development of China's education this year is due to the implementation of the policy of education by the whole people, which has broken through the small circle of education relying solely on state funding and a small number of experts, making education the cause of the whole Party and the whole people, and implementing the mass line in running education, thereby rapidly increasing the number of schools; it is also due to the implementation of the policy of combining education with labor production, with schools running factories and farms, factories running schools, people's communes and agricultural cooperatives running schools, and combining work and study, and part-work and part-study. This not only greatly improved the quality of teaching and cultivated students' labor concepts, but also gave workers and peasants the opportunity to receive education, which is conducive to the development of production. Currently, China's education is in a period of great innovation, and the implementation of the Party's socialist education policy will cultivate a large number of talented people with socialist consciousness and culture for China, and will create favorable conditions for gradually eliminating the difference between manual and mental labor. This year, the development of science and technology is progressing rapidly, not only is the technical reform movement of the broad masses of workers and peasants flourishing, but also scientific and technical personnel have made amazing achievements in attacking "cutting-edge science." The whole Party and the whole people running science and technology is forming a climax. Some projects in China's twelve-year science plan have been completed, and other projects will be completed five to seven years ahead of schedule. This year, the health cause has also become a vigorous mass movement, with the patriotic health movement centered on eliminating the four pests having made great achievements, and many pest-free counties and cities have emerged, with hygiene becoming a social trend in many places. This year has also been a year of unprecedented prosperity for literature and art, especially folk literature and art, which has truly blossomed with a hundred flowers and is full of vibrant colors. Reactionaries at home and abroad have always ridiculed the scientific and cultural backwardness of the Chinese people. With this year's leap forward, we can loudly answer: let these fools laugh, the Chinese people are sweeping away all backward phenomena in the scientific and cultural fields, and will be able to climb the peaks of world science and culture in a not-so-long time.
    In the context of an all-round leap forward in various undertakings, China has recently witnessed an irresistible upsurge of people's communes. This is an inevitable trend in China's situation. The all-round leap forward in China's agricultural production, the increasingly high socialist consciousness of the 500 million peasants, coupled with the development of industry by the whole people, education by the whole people, and arming by the whole people, have made the original agricultural production cooperatives unable to meet the requirements of the development of the situation. Establishing people's communes that comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and that combine industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and that integrate townships and communes, has become the urgent desire of the broad masses of peasants. The mass movement of people's communes has only just begun for two months, and by the end of September, 90% of the farmers nationwide had already joined people's communes. Although people's communes are currently mainly more socialist collective ownership, they already contain some elements of ownership by the whole people, and these elements of ownership by the whole people will continue to grow and will completely replace collective ownership in three, four, five, or six years. Although the current nature of the people's communes is still socialist, they will be the best organizational form for building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism. Therefore, the people's commune is an event of great historical significance. The militarization of labor organization, the combat readiness of actions, and the collectivization of life implemented in the people's communes are suitable for the needs of the current leap forward situation. The militia divisions that have been established in various places, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, are military organizations, labor organizations, educational organizations, and sports organizations. They usually carry out labor production, education, and sports activities, and once imperialism launches a war of aggression against China, they will fight, making it impossible for the aggressors to move an inch.
    The great achievements made in China's socialist construction over the past year give people full reason to believe that building our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism, is not a very distant matter. Today, when celebrating National Day, the Chinese people have never felt so happy and jubilant, and this is by no means accidental.
    The great achievements of the past year are a brilliant victory for the general line of socialist construction put forward by our Party. Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, starting from the basic point of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific reality of China, based on the experience and lessons of our Party in carrying out revolution and construction for more than 30 years, especially the experience and lessons of 1956 and 1957, and absorbing the beneficial experience and lessons of the international communist movement, formulated the general line of socialist construction at the Party's National Congress held in May this year. The basic spirit of this general line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and lead the masses to advance towards the goal of socialism. The general line calls for exerting utmost efforts, which means exerting the revolutionary efforts of the masses, and mobilizing all positive factors, which means mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses. The general line stipulates that the policy of running various undertakings is the policy of the mass line. The general line puts forward the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution, which means using mass movements to develop China's science and technology and culture. The socialist general line put forward by the Party reflects the greatest interests and greatest demands of the broad masses of the people, and therefore quickly grasped the masses and became a huge material force; it was also quickly grasped by the masses, greatly enlightening their socialist consciousness, greatly liberating their thinking, fully developing their communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, and fully developing their revolutionary enthusiasm and pioneering spirit. It is precisely for this reason that the greatest feature of the development of various undertakings in China this year is its universality. In the past, everyone was familiar with the universal mass movement for developing agriculture. Now, industry by the whole people, transportation by the whole people, education by the whole people, science by the whole people, arming by the whole people... The all-round leap forward in various undertakings in China is essentially a vigorous mass movement on a national scale. The practice since this year has most persuasively shown that: no matter where or in what undertaking, if one does not rely on and mobilize the masses, but only relies on a few people, the result will inevitably be cold and deserted, listless, slow progress in work, depressed mood, and rigid thinking; on the contrary, if one relies on and mobilizes the masses, the result will be vigorous, full of energy, rapid development in work, a happy mood, and lively thinking. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "In addition to the leadership of the Party, 600 million people are a decisive factor. When there are more people, there are more opinions, higher enthusiasm, and greater drive." Our Party is precisely giving full play to this strength, mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the 600 million people, which can create unprecedented achievements. The large-scale water conservancy construction last winter and this spring would have been impossible to imagine without a mass movement. The great leap forward on the steel front this summer and autumn would not have been successful without a vigorous mass movement. Our socialist cause is a great and earth-shaking undertaking, and if we do not fully mobilize the masses to participate in this undertaking, we will inevitably accomplish nothing. The socialist cause must be the cause of the masses of the people. Whether in revolutionary struggle or in production and construction, the basic line of all our Party's work is the mass line. Combining the Party's leadership with the mass line, we will be invincible and overcome all obstacles. We are more familiar with carrying out mass movements in rural work, and we have experience and remarkable results. The problem now is that we must promote the method of carrying out mass movements on a large scale to industrial construction, first to the steel front, and then to all other undertakings. Over the past year, we have accumulated a set of rich experiences in carrying out mass movements on a large scale, such as experimenting with test plots, organizing visits, comparisons, and on-site meetings, and carrying out big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, and big debates. As long as we closely rely on the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and vigorous pioneering spirit of the broad masses of the people, we can complete any arduous task and overcome any enemy.
    Today, when the Chinese people celebrate National Day, they will not forget that the American aggressors are eyeing us covetously in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. The American aggressors have always been hostile to the Chinese people and have occupied China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Although it recently agreed to resume Sino-US talks, it is again playing the so-called "ceasefire" conspiracy, and is increasingly intensifying military provocations and war threats against China in the Taiwan Strait area, interfering in the Chinese people's recovery of the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu, and attempting to expand its aggression against China. This is the root cause of the current tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area. The fundamental solution is for the American armed forces to immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area. The Chinese people resolutely oppose these acts of aggression by the American aggressors that violate all norms of international law. The Chinese people must recover the coastal islands such as Jinmen and Mazu, and resolutely oppose American interference in China's internal affairs. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which is China's sacred and inviolable sovereignty. American imperialism is not only carrying out aggression against China, but its armed forces have also invaded Korea and Lebanon, and have established military bases in many places around the world, carrying out aggression everywhere, expanding its arms and preparing for war, creating tense situations, and threatening world peace. American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. However, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The life of imperialism will not be long." "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism, is the task of the people of the world." We, the Chinese people, firmly stand together with the people of the fraternal socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, together with the national independent countries and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the people of colonies and semi-colonies, together with all peace-loving people, to fight against the aggression and war policies of imperialism, for world peace and the cause of human progress.
    Today, the Chinese people are beginning to enter the tenth year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The glorious and great tasks before us are to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan, especially the plan to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year. At the same time, we must strive to have an even greater leap forward in all fronts of socialist construction in the coming year than in the past year. This year is the first year of three years of hard struggle, and next year will be a decisive year of three years of hard struggle. The tasks for next year are arduous, and there are still many difficulties on our road forward, and there are still many shortcomings in our work, but we believe that since the Chinese people have been able to overthrow the three great mountains that were pressing down on our heads – imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism – and establish the People's Republic, and have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the past nine years, especially in the past year, then we will definitely be able to overcome all the shortcomings in our work and overcome all the difficulties in our work. Let all our people, under the wise leadership of our great Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, hold high the red banner of the general line of socialist construction, continue to carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, guard against arrogance and impatience, and greet the tenth anniversary of National Day with even greater and more brilliant achievements!

### 全民的节日，全民的胜利！

    全民的节日，全民的胜利！
    今天是我们伟大的国家——中华人民共和国成立第九周年。从黑龙江到海南岛，从帕米尔高原到东海，从城市到农村，举国欢腾，庆祝这个伟大的全民节日！
    在庆祝今年国庆的时候，我国人民比以往任何一年都更加兴高彩烈。因为我国人民在党的英明的领导下，经过一年来的巨大的努力，在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的全面的胜利，我国社会主义建设事业以史无前例的高速度向前大跃进。
    过去的一年，是我国经济形势发生极大变化的一年，这种变化开始于全民整风运动和反右派斗争的后期。全民整风运动和反右派斗争的决定性的胜利，使我国社会生产力获得了大解放，使我国的经济猛烈地发展起来。一年来经济形势的变化首先从农业方面开始，接着是农业的跃进推动了工业的跃进，从而也推动了商业和交通运输的发展。今年经济建设的大跃进的显著特点是工业和农业同时并举，而且都以前所未有的规模和速度向前奔驰。在工业生产方面，由于贯彻执行了中央企业和地方企业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，也就是说实行了全民办工业的方针，今年以来逐月上升，1月到8月的工业和手工业的总产值比去年同期增长47％，其中8月份的总产值比去年同期增长一倍。目前全国人民正鼓足干劲，响应党中央关于把钢产翻一番的伟大号召，为实现今年生产一千零七十万吨钢而奋斗。一个以钢为纲的全民办工业的群众运动高潮正在发展着。国庆前夕从全国各地传来钢铁战线上的捷报，表明了今年钢产翻一番的任务一定能够完成。预计今年工业和手工业的总产值，将比去年增长60％以上。这样的高速度大大超过第一个五年计划期间的平均每年的增长速度（19.2％）和最高年份的增长速度（33％），也是资本主义国家从来没有过的。从今年工业大跃进的情况看来，我国在工业方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家所需的时间，将比原来预计的大大缩短。在农业生产方面，今年由于发动了广大农民群众的冲天干劲，进行了大规模的兴修水利、积肥、深耕和土壤改良、密植、改良种子，以及采取了其他田间管理的有效措施，不但出现了对于破除迷信、解放思想和积累农作经验有极大作用的高额丰产“卫星”田，而且获得了各类作物的大面积丰收。今年粮食产量预计将较去年增产一倍，达到七千多亿斤，棉花也将增产一倍多，达到七千万担，其他油料作物、烟叶、茶叶也将获得丰收。这样大面积的高速度增产，不仅在我国历史上而且在世界历史上都是空前的。特别值得指出的是今年我国农业生产是在没有大量的农业机械和化学肥料的情况下增产的。我国农业的大跃进，无论在经济上、政治上、理论上以及农业科学方面都具有极其重大的意义。许多省经过今年的苦战，可以提前完成全国农业发展纲要草案的主要指标；我国的粮食问题已经基本上得到了解决；一切农业落后论、农业缓进论、土地报酬递减论、马尔萨斯人口论等资产阶级学说和各种各样的右倾保守思想，在铁的事实面前彻底地破产了；我国今年农业耕作技术的许多新创造，对农业科学提供了丰富的极其宝贵的经验。今年我国的交通运输和商业也有了很大的发展，它们对工农业生产大跃进起了重大的作用。特别是商业工作人员服务态度的极大的改进，是广大人民群众一致称赞的。我国工业和农业的大跃进生动地证明，解放了的生产力可以以人们过去梦想不到的速度飞跃；不仅在经济上政治上、而且在思想上解放了的人民冲破了历史上一切陈规，创造了人间的奇迹。
    经济战线上的大跃进形势逼人，今年我国文化教育、科学技术、文学艺术也出现了大跃进的局面。我国开始进入技术革命和文化革命的新时代。教育事业方面，全国扫盲工作有了很大的发展，过去认为需要十年或十年以上才能完成的扫盲工作，现在看来至多两三年就可以完成，今年已有67％的县市基本上扫除了文盲。全国的小学教育在很短期间内已基本上做到了普及，93％多的学龄儿童已经入学。中等学校的学生比去年增加了约一倍，农业中学有了极大的发展。高等学校的校数比去年增加了四、五倍，学生人数增加了60％以上。此外，各种业余学校也有了很大的增加。今年我国教育事业这样迅速的发展，是由于贯彻实行了全民办教育的方针，使教育事业冲破了仅仅依靠国家出钱、依靠少数专家办的小圈子，成为全党全民的事业，实行了办教育的群众路线，因而学校数量迅速增加；同时也是由于贯彻实行了教育和劳动生产相结合的方针，学校办工厂和办农场，工厂办学校，人民公社和农业合作社办学校，勤工俭学，半工半读。这不仅大大提高了教学的质量，培养了学生的劳动观念，而且也使工农群众得到受教育的机会，有利于生产的发展。目前我国教育事业正处在一个大革新的时期，党的社会主义教育方针的贯彻实行，将为我国培养出大批有社会主义觉悟的有文化的人才，并将为逐渐消除体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别创造有利的条件。今年科学技术的发展一日千里，不仅是广大工农群众的技术改革运动蓬勃开展，而且科学技术人员猛攻“尖端科学”也取得了惊人的成就。全党全民办科学技术正形成高潮。我国的十二年科学规划中有些项目已经完成，其他的项目将提前五年到七年完成。卫生事业今年也成为轰轰烈烈的群众运动，以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动已经取得了很大的成绩，出现了许多四无县、市，讲卫生已经在许多地方成为社会风尚。文学艺术事业今年也是空前繁荣的一年，特别是民间文学艺术真个百花齐放，万紫千红。国内外反动派一向讥笑我国人民科学落后、文化落后。有了今年的跃进，我们可以响亮地回答：让这些蠢才们笑吧，我国人民正在扫荡科学和文化领域中的一切落后现象，而且用不了很长的时间，就可以攀登世界科学文化的高峰了。
    在各项事业全面跃进的情况下，我国最近出现了一个人民公社化的势不可当的高潮。这是我国形势发展的必然的趋势。我国农业生产的全面跃进，五亿农民愈来愈高的社会主义觉悟，再加上全民办工业、全民办教育和全民武装的发展，使得原来的农业生产合作社已经不能适应形势发展的要求。建立农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵互相结合、乡社合一的人民公社，就成为广大农民的迫切愿望。人民公社化的群众运动开始才不过两个月，到9月底止，全国已经有90％的农户参加了人民公社。人民公社虽然在目前主要还是更社会主义化的集体所有制，但是已经包含了若干全民所有制的成份，而且这种全民所有制成份将不断增长，在三、四年或五、六年内将完全代替集体所有制。人民公社虽然目前的性质还是社会主义的，但是将是建成社会主义和逐步过渡到共产主义的最好的组织形式。因此，人民公社化是具有重大历史意义的事件。人民公社中实行劳动组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，是适合目前跃进形势的需要的。目前各地已经建立的民兵师，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，它是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织，平时进行劳动生产、教育和体育活动，而一旦帝国主义对我国发动侵略战争的时候，就进行战斗，叫侵略者寸步难行。
    一年来我国社会主义建设事业所取得的伟大成就，使人们有充分的理由相信，把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，并由社会主义逐步向共产主义过渡，已经不是很遥远的事情了。今天庆祝国庆的时候，我国人民从来没有这样心情愉快和欢欣鼓舞，这绝不是偶然的。
    过去一年中伟大成就，是我们党所提出的社会主义建设总路线的光辉的胜利。毛泽东同志和党中央从马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国的具体实际相结合的这一基本点出发，根据我们党三十多年来进行革命和建设的经验教训，特别是1956年和1957年的经验教训，并且吸收了国际共产主义运动中有益的经验教训，在今年5月间举行的党的全国代表大会上制定了社会主义建设的总路线。这个总路线的基本精神，就是相信人民群众，依靠人民群众，动员人民群众，领导人民群众向社会主义的目标前进。这个总路线所提出的鼓足干劲就是鼓足人民群众的革命干劲，调动一切积极因素就是调动人民群众的积极性。总路线所规定的办各项事业的方针就是群众路线的方针。总路线提出技术革命和文化革命的任务，就是要用群众运动的办法来发展我国的科学技术和文化。党所提出的社会主义总路线反映了广大人民群众的最大利益和最大要求，因此很快的掌握了群众，变成巨大的物质力量；也很快的为人民群众所掌握，大大启发了他们社会主义觉悟，使他们的思想获得了极大的解放，使他们敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格得到充分的发扬，使他们的革命干劲和首创精神得到了充分的发挥。也正因为这个缘故，今年我国各项事业发展的最大特点就是全民性。过去，发展农业的全民性的群众运动是大家熟悉的，现在，全民办工业、全民办运输、全民办教育、全民办科学、全民武装……我国各项事业的全面跃进，实质上就是全国规模的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。今年以来的实践最有说服力地表明了：无论那一个地方或那一项事业，如果不依靠和发动群众，只依靠少数人，结果必然是冷冷清清、无精打采、工作进展迟缓、心情压抑、思想硬化；相反地，如果依靠了和发动了群众，那结果就是轰轰烈烈，干劲十足，工作飞跃发展，心情舒畅，思想活泼。毛泽东同志说，“除了党的领导之外，六亿人口是一个决定的因素。人多议论多，热气高，干劲大。”。我们党正是充分地发挥这个长处，把六亿人民群众的积极性和创造性统统调动起来，这就可以做出前无古人的伟绩来。去冬今春的大规模的水利建设，没有群众运动是不可能设想的。今年夏秋的钢铁战线的大跃进，没有轰轰烈烈的群众运动也是不能成功的。我们的社会主义事业是翻天复地的艰巨的事业，如果不充分发动人民群众参加这个事业，我们就必然一事无成。社会主义事业必须是人民群众的事业。无论在革命斗争中或者在生产建设中，我们党的一切工作的基本路线就是群众路线。党的领导和群众路线相结合，我们就战无不胜，攻无不克。在农村工作中大搞群众运动是我们比较熟悉的，有经验也是成效卓著的。现在的问题是必须把大搞群众运动的办法推广到工业建设，首先是钢铁战线上去，推广到其他一切事业上去。过去一年中，我们已经积累了种试验田，组织参观评比和现场会议，大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论等一套丰富的大搞群众运动的经验。只要我们紧紧地依靠广大人民群众的冲天的革命干劲和生气勃勃的首创精神，我们就能完成任何艰巨的任务，就能够战胜任何敌人。
    今天，我国人民在庆祝国庆的时候，不会忘记美国侵略者正在台湾和台湾海峡地区虎视眈眈。美国侵略者一贯敌视我国人民，占领了我国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛。它最近虽然同意恢复中美会谈，但又玩弄所谓“停火”阴谋，并且日益加紧在台湾海峡地区对我国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，干涉我国人民收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，妄图扩大对我国的侵略。这是造成目前台湾海峡地区紧张局势的根源。根本的解决办法是美国武装力量立即撤出台湾和台湾海峡地区。我国人民坚决反对美国侵略者这些违反国际法一切准则的侵略罪行。我国人民一定要收复金门、马祖等沿海岛屿，坚决反对美国干涉我国内政。我国人民一定要解放台湾和澎湖列岛，这是我国人民神圣不可侵犯的主权。美帝国主义不仅对中国进行侵略，而且它的武装部队还侵占了朝鲜、黎巴嫩，并在全世界许多地方建立了军事基地，到处进行侵略，扩军备战，制造紧张局势，威胁世界和平。美帝国主义是全世界爱好和平人民的最凶恶的敌人。但是，正如毛泽东同志所说的，“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了”。“结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务”。我们中国人民坚定地同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各兄弟国家人民一起，同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族独立国家和人民以及殖民地和半殖民地的人民一起，同一切爱好和平的人民一起，为反对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，为世界和平和人类进步事业而奋斗。
    今天，我国人民开始进入中华人民共和国成立的第十年。摆在我们面前的光荣和伟大的任务是努力完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，特别是今年钢产一千零七十万吨的计划，同时，还要争取在今后一年中在社会主义建设的各个战线上有一个比过去一年更大的跃进。今年是苦战三年的第一年，明年是苦战三年的有决定意义的一年。明年的任务是繁重的，在我们的前进道路上还有许多困难，我们的工作中还有不少缺点，但是，我们相信，我国人民既然能够推翻了压在我们头上的三座大山——帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义，建立了人民共和国，并且在过去九年，特别是过去一年的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了伟大的胜利，那末，就一定能够克服我们工作中的一切缺点，战胜工作中的一切困难。让我们全体人民在我们伟大的以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，继续发扬不断革命的精神，戒骄戒躁，以更加伟大、更加辉煌的成就，迎接国庆的十周年！
