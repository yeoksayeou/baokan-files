Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from Taipei: Taiwan newspapers have recently been rife with discussions about US-Chiang relations. Taiwan newspapers are dissatisfied with the US side's manipulation of the "ceasefire" plot, attempting to shift the responsibility for warmongering onto the Taiwan authorities. The newspapers say that because of this move by the United States, the Taiwan authorities have become "regarded by everyone in the world as dangerous individuals, avoided like the plague." Meanwhile, "American allies are doing their utmost to publicize that it is they who have tied our hands and feet, preventing the flames of war from expanding, posing as peace envoys." Isn't this "lamentable"? Taiwan newspapers angrily state that the relationship between the United States and the Taiwan authorities is actually one of "axe striking chisel, chisel entering wood." The US is the axe, and the Taiwan authorities are the chisel. Taiwan's "United Daily News" said, "Dulles has been besieged in New York for the past few weeks over the Jinmen and Mazu issues, hardly able to breathe," but there is no need to be "so vicious."

Many Taiwan newspapers continue to worry that the Taiwan authorities will be abandoned by the United States. The "New Life Daily" wrote, "Appeasers and those who want to break free within the United States are launching a fierce offensive," which has become an "unfavorable international factor" for the Taiwan authorities.

Taiwan's "Independence Evening Post" editorial said that judging from the many recent actions of the United States, "all signs make us suspicious." The newspaper worried that the United States would one day be forced to leave the Western Pacific.

    台湾报纸骂美国假充和平使者
    新华社19日讯　台北消息：台湾报纸最近对美蒋关系议论纷纭。台湾报纸不满美国方面玩弄“停火”阴谋，力图把好战的责任推到台湾当局身上的做法，报纸说，由于美国的这一着棋，使台湾当局在世界上成为“被人人都把他看作危险人物，避之唯恐不及”。而“美国盟友则竭力宣传是它捆住我们手脚，才使战火不致扩大，俨然以和平使者自居”，此事“能不令人可叹”？台湾报纸愤愤不平地说，其实美国和台湾当局的关系是“斧打凿，凿入木”的关系。美国是斧，台湾当局是凿。台湾“联合报”说，“杜勒斯这几个星期为了金、马问题，在纽约到处被围剿得喘不过气来”，但也不必“那般恶劣”。
    许多台湾报纸继续担心台湾当局被美国抛弃。“新生报”写道，“美国内部的姑息主义者和摆脱主义者正在展开猛烈的攻势”，这已经成为对台湾当局“不利的国际因素”。
    台湾“自立晚报”的社论说，从美国最近的许许多多作法看来，“一切迹象都让我们怀疑”。这家报纸担忧美国总有一天会被迫离开西太平洋。
