    Further Strengthen the Anti-Imperialist Patriotic United Front
    Strive to Build a Prosperous and Happy New Tibet
    Dalai Lama
    The ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a day when we and the people of the whole country celebrate enthusiastically with joyful hearts.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, our great motherland has achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and has overfulfilled the first Five-Year Plan. Since last year, our country has entered the second great period of national economic construction, and at the same time, great victories have been achieved in the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, thus, social relations have undergone fundamental changes, and people's ideological consciousness has undergone corresponding changes. It marks that the foundation of the old society has been completely broken, and a new foundation of a socialist and communist society without exploitation has been established. This is a great victory for the people of our country. At the same time, a vigorous rectification movement has been launched throughout the country, using the method of democratic debate to distinguish right from wrong, and correctly handle contradictions among the people. After the anti-Party activities of the rightists were thoroughly exposed and criticized by the broad masses of the people, they have fallen into an extremely isolated situation. This is another great victory for the people of the whole country on the ideological and political fronts.
    Inspired and encouraged by the general line of socialism, the people of the whole country have brought into play their great enthusiasm, tapped potential, contributed wisdom, and set off a high tide of great leap forward with soaring energy. Within fifteen years or less, our country will surely be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output of major industrial products.
    While carrying out various educations in various minority areas of the country, we have also carried out patriotic and socialist education in the Tibetan area of Tibet.
    The Tibetan people of Tibet are one of the nationalities with a long history in China. Since the Tibetan people returned to the big family of the motherland, they have fully enjoyed the rights of freedom and equality together with other fraternal nationalities. The bright and happy socialist general line, which conforms to the vital interests of the 600 million Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, is the broad road in front of our Tibetan people. There is no other way.
    In the future, all our monks and lay people must further strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, and on this basis, use practical actions to continuously strengthen unity and progress to oppose and counter the various conspiracies of reactionary elements at home and abroad to undermine the unification of the motherland and national unity, and work together to build a new socialist Tibet.
    Our country has the right to take all appropriate means to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, Mazu and other coastal islands of our country. This is our country's internal affair and no foreign interference is allowed. If the American imperialists dare to continue to carry out armed threats and war provocations against the 600 million Chinese people, we Tibetan people will unite with the people of the whole country to resolutely drive the aggressive American imperialists out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the great unity of the people of all nationalities in the country!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!
    Get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, American imperialism!
    Long live world peace!

    进一步加强反帝爱国统一战线
    为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力
    达赖喇嘛
    中华人民共和国开国九周年纪念日，是我们和全国人民怀着愉快的心情进行热烈庆祝的一天。
    我们伟大的祖国，在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，并且超额的完成了第一个五年计划。从去年起，我国已进入第二个伟大的国民经济建设时期，同时在政治上和思想上的社会主义革命也取得了伟大的胜利，因而，社会关系起了根本的变化，人们的思想意识有了相应的转变。它标志着旧社会的基础已被彻底打破，没有人剥削人的社会主义社会和共产主义社会的新基础已经建立起来。这是我们全国人民的伟大胜利。与此同时，在全国范围内展开了轰轰烈烈的整风运动，采用民主辩论的方法，辨明了是非；并且正确的处理了人民内部的矛盾。右派分子的反党活动，被广大人民群众彻底揭露和批判以后，他们已陷入极端孤立的境地。这是全国人民在思想战线和政治战线上取得的又一伟大胜利。
    全国人民在社会主义总路线的启发和鼓舞下，个个都发挥了极大的积极性，挖潜力、献智慧，以冲天的干劲掀起了大跃进的高潮。在十五年或更短一些的时间内，在主要工业产品的产量方面，我国一定可以赶上和超过英国。
    在全国各少数民族地区分别进行了各种教育的同时，我们西藏地区也进行了爱国主义和社会主义的教育。
    西藏藏族是中国境内具有悠久历史的民族之一。西藏人民回到祖国大家庭以来，和其它兄弟民族一起，充分享受了自由平等的权利。符合包括西藏人民在内的中国六亿人民切身利益的光明幸福的社会主义总路线，是我们西藏人民面前的康庄大道，除此而外，其它的道路是没有的。
    今后，我们全体僧俗人民要进一步加强反帝爱国统一战线，并在此基础上以不断加强团结进步的实际行动来反对和回击内外反动分子的破坏祖国统一和民族团结的各种阴谋活动，为建设社会主义新西藏而共同努力。
    我国有权采取一切适当的方式解放我国的领土台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖及其它沿海岛屿，这是我国的内政，不许外国干涉，如果美帝国主义胆敢向六亿中国人民继续进行武装威胁和战争挑衅，我们西藏人民将和全国人民一道，坚决把侵略成性的美帝国主义从台湾和台湾海峡赶出去！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全国各族人民大团结万岁！
    中国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    美帝国主义从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去！
    世界和平万岁！
