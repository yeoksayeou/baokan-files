    Report on the Labor-Defense Sports System by Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission

    This newspaper reports: Comrade Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, had submitted a written report to Premier Zhou Enlai on the issue of the Labor-Defense Sports System before his death. The full text is published as follows:

    Premier:

    The "Regulations on the Provisional Implementation of the Prepare for Labor and Defense" system, which was approved and promulgated by the Government Administration Council in 1954, has proven to be very effective and well-received by the masses after several years of practice. However, our past work also had some shortcomings, mainly due to the constraints of dogmatism. We portrayed the Labor-Defense system as too profound and complex, making it difficult for people to understand and even intimidating. In its implementation, conservative ideas were very serious, mainly emphasizing conditions, which affected the development of the work. Before the end of last year, it was only carried out in the military and in secondary schools and above. It was rarely implemented in factories, and not at all in rural areas.

    This year, with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, sports has also shown a Great Leap Forward. In some schools, the Labor-Defense system standard has been fully met by all students except those who are sick or weak, and many people in factories and rural areas have also quickly passed the standard. Therefore, from the summer of 1954 when the Labor-Defense system was implemented, to the end of 1957, only more than 1.7 million people reached the standard (excluding the military), while in the nine months of 1958, more than 5 million people reached the standard. At the same time, new achievements have emerged with more than 730 large and medium-sized schools, 29 factories, and some government organizations achieving 100% compliance with the Labor-Defense system standard. These achievements are mainly the result of putting politics in command and implementing the mass line in the work of the Labor-Defense system.

    The facts this year prove that the Labor-Defense system is a good way to achieve universal conscription, mobilize the nation's teenagers and young adults to adhere to regular exercise, and achieve comprehensive physical development, so that they can better study, work, and defend the motherland. The items stipulated in the Labor-Defense system are all common exercises for physical fitness, such as running, jumping, weightlifting, rope climbing, etc. The standards are also determined based on the general physical fitness of people. At the same time, different requirements are put forward according to different genders and ages, encouraging more people to adhere to regular exercise and gradually improve. It is formulated according to the basic requirements of our country's socialist construction cause for people in physical exercise. All teenagers and young adults over the age of thirteen, except those who are sick or weak, are required to pass the Labor-Defense system.

    According to the Premier's instructions, after several theoretical discussions and referring to the opinions of the Labor-Defense System Scientific Discussion Conference, and our investigation of the sports performance of 160,000 people in 1957, the name "Prepare for Labor and Defense System" was changed to "Labor-Defense Sports System", and the items and standards were revised to make them simple and clear. The revised Labor-Defense system has a total of six items (originally nine), and five items for the junior level. In addition to the four items stipulated for speed, strength, agility, and endurance to meet the needs of comprehensive physical development, in order to carry out preliminary national defense education for the people, as a measure to achieve universal conscription, a national defense sports item that can be widely promoted has been added. These five items are uniformly stipulated by us to ensure the basic requirements of the Labor-Defense system. These items include: 1. 100 meters or 60 meters of short-distance running; 2. 800 meters or 1500 meters of middle-distance running; 3. High jump or long jump; 4. Weightlifting and pull-ups, rope climbing, pole climbing; 5. Shooting or grenade throwing. Another item is determined by the sports committee of the province, city, or autonomous region according to local conditions. In this way, on the one hand, the enthusiasm of the localities can be stimulated, and at the same time, the characteristics of the regions are taken into account, so that the Labor-Defense system can be promoted more widely. The current standards can generally be achieved by people after a period of exercise.

    The revised draft of the Labor-Defense Sports System regulations is hereby submitted for approval.

    关于劳动卫国体育制度的报告
    本报讯　国家体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩同志在生前曾经就关于劳动卫国体育制度问题给周恩来总理作过书面报告，兹将全文发表如下：总理：
    1954年经政务院批准公布施行的“准备劳动与卫国”制度暂行条例，经过几年的实践证明，效果很好，很受群众欢迎。但是，我们过去的工作也有一些缺点，主要是受教条主义的束缚，把劳卫制讲得很高深、很复杂，使人不易了解甚至望而生畏。在推行上保守思想很严重，主要是强调条件，使工作发展受到影响。到去年年底以前，只在部队和中等以上学校中开展，工厂搞得很少，农村没有推行。
    今年随着工农业的大跃进，体育也呈现了大跃进的局面，劳卫制在有些学校里，除病弱学生外已经全部达到了标准，而工厂、农村也有很多人迅速地通过了标准。所以从1954年夏推行劳卫制以来到1957年底只有一百七十多万人达到标准（不包括军队），而1958年九个月的时间就有五百多万人达到标准。同时，出现了七百三十多所大、中、小学校，二十九个工厂和一部分机关百分之百的达到劳卫制标准的新成绩。这些成绩主要是劳卫制工作上政治挂帅和贯彻群众路线的结果。
    今年的事实证明，劳卫制是实现全民皆兵，发动全国少年和青壮年坚持经常锻炼，达到身体的全面发展，以便能更好地学习、劳动和保卫祖国的一种好办法。劳卫制规定的项目，都是锻炼身体的普通项目，如跑、跳、举重、爬绳等，标准也是根据一般人的体育基础确定的。同时，根据不同性别、年龄分级分组提出不同的要求，鼓舞更多的人经常坚持锻炼，逐步提高。它是根据我国社会主义建设事业，对人民在体育锻炼上的基本要求而制定的。凡是十三岁以上的少年和青壮年除病弱的以外，都要求能通过劳卫制。
    根据总理指示，经过我们数次务虚并参照劳卫制科学讨论会的意见，和我们在1957年调查的十六万人次的运动成绩，将“准备劳动与卫国制度”的名称改为“劳动卫国体育制度”，并在项目标准上进行了修改，使之简单明了。经过修改后的劳卫制共有六个项目（原有九项），少年级五项，除按全面发展身体需要的速度、力量、灵敏和耐力规定四项以外，为了对人民进行初步国防教育，作为达到全民皆兵的一种措施，增加了一项可以普遍推行的国防体育项目。这五个项目由我们统一规定，以保证劳卫制的基本要求。这些项目包括：一、短距离跑的一百公尺或六十公尺；二、中距离跑的八百公尺或一千五百公尺；三、跳高或跳远；四、举重和引体向上、爬绳、爬竿；五、射击运动或手榴弹掷远。另有一项由省、市、自治区体委根据当地情况确定。这样一方面可以激发地方的积极性，同时也照顾了地区的特点，使劳卫制便于更广泛地推行。现在的标准，一般人只要经过一定时期的锻炼就可以达到。
    现将劳动卫国体育制度条例修正草案送上，请审批。
