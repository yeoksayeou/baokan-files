From our personal experience, we feel that adjusting accommodation according to production units is a really good thing. Because in this way, the workers in each of our workshops live and work together, just like everyone says: returning to the dormitory area is like returning to a warm family. Everyone naturally establishes a relationship of mutual assistance and love in production and life. At the same time, regardless of employees and their families, they regard the production tasks of their unit as their own, exerting as much effort as they can.

In the past, Yangquan No. 4 Mine transferred a large number of veteran workers to support new mines and added a large number of new workers. These new workers were scattered in their residences after entering the mine, and their education was also poor. Therefore, some people still had liberal, undisciplined, selfish, and self-serving thoughts and behaviors, which often affected the unity between them, especially in production cooperation. After the rectification campaign and the adjustment of dormitories, the production unit and accommodation were together, and the workers could jointly help overcome shortcomings and establish a communist style. For example, during the rectification movement, leading cadres visited door to door, studied work with everyone, and inspired employees to speak out fully, achieving a state where everyone was happy and engaged in large-scale production; the implementation of division of labor and contracting in technology, mutual assistance, and common improvement were all favorable conditions brought about by the adjustment of dormitories. In order to unify actions, each workshop uses an early morning bugle call to gather, which makes those who were late for work arrive early. Workers not only take care of each other during illness but also help and cooperate with each other at work.

    树立了共产主义风格
    吴四子　韩玉成
    从我们的亲身体验中，觉得按照生产单位调整住宿，实在是件好事。因为这样一来，咱们每个车间的工人，生产生活都在一起，正如大家所说的：一回到宿舍区里，就像回到一个温暖的大家庭一样。大家在生产和生活当中，很自然地建立了互助友爱的关系，同时不论职工和家属，都把本单位的生产任务看成是自己的任务，一股劲地能出多大力就出多大力。
    过去，阳泉四矿曾抽调了大批老工人支援了新的矿井，补充了大批新的工人。这些新工人入矿后居住分散，受的教育也差，因而有些人还有自由散漫、自私自利的思想和行为，往往也影响互相间的团结，特别是在生产上的协作。经过整风和调整宿舍后，生产单位和住宿在一起，工人们便可以共同帮助克服缺点，树立共产主义的风格。比如在整风运动中，领导干部登门拜访，和大家一起研究工作，启发职工鸣尽放透，达到人人心情舒畅，大搞生产；在技术上实行分工包干，互相帮助，共同提高，都是调整宿舍带来的有利条件。各个车间为了行动统一，早起鸣号集中，使误班迟到者早到了，工人们相互之间，不仅在疾病期间互相护理，而且在工作上互助协作。
