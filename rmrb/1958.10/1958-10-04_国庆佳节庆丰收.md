Celebrating the Harvest on National Day
By our reporter Jin Feng

The Grain Marshal Takes Command

Corn stalks a foot long, cotton plants over five feet high, tobacco leaves over ten feet high, pumpkins the size of giant gourds, and bountiful peanuts are presented before people's eyes, forming a dazzling picture of a bumper harvest.

In Lushan People's Commune in Henan, one county, one commune, fifty thousand mu of crops will yield four thousand jin of grain per mu this year, with a total output of two billion jin, approximately ten times that of last year. Su Dianxuan, a national model worker, couldn't help but repeatedly praise these bountiful fruits. He had farmed for over forty years and had never seen such a good harvest; it was truly a rare sight. In the past, the old folks said: A golden dipper and a silver dipper are not as good as two or three dippers from the land. A hundred jin of corn was the highest hope of farmers in that era. After liberation, in 1950, when he was the head of a mutual aid team, he harvested over three hundred jin per mu and was selected as a national model worker to meet Chairman Mao in Beijing. In recent years, the agricultural cooperative he led has always been ahead of others, but despite their efforts, last year they harvested just over five hundred jin of grain per mu, an annual increase of less than 10%. This year, the output has increased tenfold, with an expected harvest of five thousand five hundred jin per mu. This is a good year beyond all imagination!

Eating Without Paying

The Lushan People's Commune's procession set off. As they walked down the street, the sound of the National Day celebration and parade in Tiananmen Square in Beijing came from the loudspeakers, and the commune members' spirits were immediately boosted. They marched in step with Beijing, in step with the people of the whole country, to report good news to Chairman Mao. Huang Zhiyuan, the platoon leader of the Commune Militia Division's guard company, who was walking at the front, was a demobilized soldier. In 1952, he was assigned to a motorized unit and participated in the National Day parade in Beijing, where he saw Chairman Mao. At this moment, he couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The procession enthusiastically echoed his call, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Today, how many people in China are shouting this name, which brings them boundless happiness, with all their love!

Just today, the Lushan People's Commune announced that they would eat without paying and implement a food supply system, with sweet potatoes available to all as needed. The people's desire for thousands of years—"no worries about food"—has been realized today under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

As the commune's parade passed through the streets and alleys of Lushan, the cooks in the commune's dining hall were busy bringing out basket after basket of freshly steamed white buns, picking up freshly fried, golden-brown fried dough sticks, and ladling out bowls of fragrant pork. The commune members all returned, and families gathered around the tables, children cheering loudly: "Mom, we have so much meat!" "Mom, there are also fried dough sticks, white buns, and even wine!" They were like a flock of little sparrows. The mothers were busy putting meat and vegetables on the plates of the older ones, feeding the younger ones buns and soup, while the fathers comfortably drank their wine.

A Toast to Chairman Mao's Health

Sixty-four-year-old Zhai Xingwang saw his wife only giving the children food and rarely eating vegetables herself, so he picked up a large piece of meat and put it in front of his wife, saying, "Thanks to Chairman Mao, we are drinking and eating meat today. You should eat some too. Don't just give it to the children. When they grow up, they will have their own to eat." Qin Xiuying, his wife, hearing this, her eyes turned red, and she remembered the child they had given away during the famine years: "If he had stayed with us, he would be seventeen or eighteen years old now." Qin Xiuying's first half of her life was spent fleeing from famine, and hunger had turned this woman, who was not yet fifty years old, into a thin, old crone. After liberation, she was given land, but her family was not strong, and life was still difficult. When the advanced cooperative was established, the cooperative took care of them, and they had enough grain to eat; but when she made something good, she always gave it to her husband and two children first, and she always ate the leftovers. Today, she really couldn't believe that such good food was available to everyone for free. She couldn't help but quietly ask her husband, "Old man, at the end of the month, we still have to settle the account, right!" "No, they won't ask you for money, so just eat with peace of mind!" Li Quanshui, the director of the management office, who had just come over to pour wine for them, happened to hear his words and laughed loudly, saying, "This is really a good time we've been waiting for. How wonderful this is." "Director, please have a drink." Qin Xiuying smiled, her face full of wrinkles, and happily stood up to propose a toast to Li Quanshui. Quanshui poured a cup for Xiuying, and then raised his own cup and said loudly, "We have such a great harvest this year and can live a good life of eating without paying. All this is because of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Today, let's drink a celebratory toast and put in even more effort to strive for a greater harvest next year. Next year, our Lushan Commune will strive for a per mu wheat yield of five thousand jin. Come, everyone, let's toast to a greater harvest next year, and to Chairman Mao's health!" Everyone in the dining hall stood up: "A toast to Chairman Mao's health!" Everyone shouted in unison, raising their glasses high. Chairman Mao, may you see this scene, see the millions of farmers in China, joyfully celebrating the harvest in the public dining halls, and toasting to your health!

    国庆佳节庆丰收
    本报记者　金凤
    粮帅升帐
    一尺来长的玉米，五尺多高的棉花，一丈多高的烟叶，大南瓜似的红薯和累累的花生，呈现在人们的面前，构成一幅灿烂夺目的丰收图景。
    河南鲁山人民公社一个县一个公社，五十万亩庄稼，今年粮食亩产将达到四千斤，总产量二十亿斤，约等于去年的十倍。全国劳动模范苏殿选看着这些丰收的果实禁不住连声赞叹。他种了四十多年庄稼，从来没有见到过这么好的收成，真是看着稀罕。从前老人说：金斗银斗不如地里打上二斗三斗。老玉米一百来斤就是那个年代农民的最高盼望。解放以后1950年他当互助组长，每亩收了三百多斤，就选上全国劳动模范到北京去见毛主席。几年来，他领导的农业社总是走在人家前面，可是紧走慢走去年每亩粮食收了五百多斤，每年增加不到10％。今年一年产量翻了十倍，每亩要收到五千五百多斤，这真是多少年想像不到的好年景呵！
    吃饭不要钱
    鲁山人民公社的队伍出发了。当他们走到街上，广播器里传来北京天安门庆祝国庆大会和游行的声音，公社社员的情绪顿然更加振奋。他们步伐整齐地和着北京的步伐，和着全国人民的步伐，向毛主席报喜。走在最前面的公社民兵师警卫连的排长黄志远，是复员军人。1952年他编在摩托部队里参加过北京的国庆检阅，看见过毛主席。这时，他忍不住高喊毛主席万岁！队伍热烈地随着他喊毛主席万岁！今天，全中国该有多少人怀着满腔的热爱在喊着这一个带给他们无限幸福的名字啊！
    就在今天，鲁山人民公社宣布了吃饭不要钱，实行伙食供给制，红薯可以各取所需。人民几千年来的愿望——“吃饭不用愁”，今天在毛主席的领导下实现了。
    当公社的游行队伍穿过鲁山的大街小巷，公社食堂的炊事员们，已在忙忙碌碌地把刚蒸好的一笼笼热气腾腾的白馍端出来，把刚炸好的焦黄油亮的油馍拣起来，把一碗碗扑鼻香的猪肉盛出来。公社的社员都回来了，一家家、一户户围着桌子团团坐下，孩子们大声欢呼：“娘，俺们这么多肉。”“娘，还有油馍，还有白饽，还有酒哩！”他们活像一群小麻雀。母亲们忙着给大的夹肉、添菜，给小的喂馍、喂汤，做父亲的却舒舒服服喝起酒来。
    为毛主席的健康干杯
    六十四岁的翟兴旺看妻子只管给孩子们夹吃的，自己很少吃菜，便夹了一大块肉送到妻子面前说：“托毛主席的福，咱们今天又喝酒又吃肉，你也吃几块，别尽给孩子吃，孩子们大了有他们吃的。”妻子秦秀英听了，眼圈一红，又想起闹饥荒那年送给人的孩子来：“留在身边该有十七八岁了。”秦秀英的前半生差不多就在逃难逃荒中混过，饥饿把这个不到五十岁的妇女折磨成又干又瘦的小老太婆。解放后，分了土地，她家劳力不强，日子过得还是困难。成立高级社时，社里有了照顾，粮食够吃了；但是做些干的她总是先尽丈夫和两个孩子吃，她自己总是吃些剩汤剩饭。今天她真有些不大相信这么好的饭食，竟让每个人随便吃不要花钱。她忍不住悄悄问她丈夫：“孩他爹，到月底咱们还该算账吧！”“不，这不会跟你算账要钱啦，你就放心吃好了！”刚走过来给他们斟酒的管理处主任李泉水凑巧听到他的话，哈哈笑着说：“这可真是盼到好光景了，这该有多美。”“主任，你请干一杯。”秦秀英笑得满脸打皱，欢天喜地站起来要给李泉水敬酒。泉水一面给秀英斟了一杯，自己又举起杯来大声说：“咱们今年有这样的大丰收，能过上吃饭不掏钱的好日子，这都是共产党毛主席领导我们的。咱们大伙今天喝了庆祝酒，要拿出更大的劲头，争取明年更大的丰收，明年咱鲁山公社小麦要争取亩产五千斤。来来来，咱们大伙为明年更大的丰收，为毛主席的健康干一杯！”食堂里的人全都站起来了：“为毛主席的健康干杯！”大家同声喊着，高高举起酒杯。毛主席，但愿你能看到这个场面，看到中国的千千万万农民，欢天喜地地在公共食堂里欢庆丰收，为你的健康干杯！
