Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th. "Independent Daily" reported today that the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Suwito told reporters from the newspaper on the evening of the 6th that the Chinese government's decision to cease shelling Jinmen for seven days and its proposal to Taiwan to hold negotiations "is the best approach under the current circumstances."

He said that China's suggestion to the Taiwan authorities to hold negotiations clearly distinguishes between the issues among the Chinese people (that is, the issue between China and the Taiwan authorities) from the issue between China and the United States. As a result, the whole world will see more clearly that there are two types of issues, of different natures, that have been confused all along.

Suwito pointed out that the issue between China and the United States is now being discussed in the Warsaw talks.

Suwito said that for the Chinese people on the mainland and Taiwan, holding negotiations is the best way forward under the current circumstances. It is also the case for other parties, because this method can eliminate the stain of interfering in issues that only concern the Chinese people.

    印度尼西亚外交部秘书长说
    两种不同性质问题分清了
    新华社雅加达7日电　“独立报”今天报道说，印度尼西亚外交部秘书长苏维托6日晚上对这家报纸的记者说，中国政府决定停止炮击金门七天并且向台湾建议举行谈判，“是目前情况下最好的办法”。
    他说，中国邀请台湾当局举行谈判的建议，把中国人之间的问题（这就是中国和台湾当局之间的问题）同中国和美国之间的问题清楚地区别开来。这样一来，全世界都会更加清楚地看出存在着不同性质的、而一直被混淆起来的两种问题。
    苏维托指出，中国和美国之间的问题现在正在华沙会谈中讨论。
    苏维托说，就大陆和台湾的中国人民来说，在目前情况下举行谈判是最好的办法。对其他方面来说也是这样，因为这个办法可以消除干涉只同中国人民有关的问题的污名。
