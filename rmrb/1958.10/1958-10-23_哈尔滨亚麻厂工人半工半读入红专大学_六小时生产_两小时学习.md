    Harbin Linen Factory Workers Enter Red and Expert University Through Part-Work, Part-Study
    Six Hours Production, Two Hours Study
    Employees tap potential, don't ask the state for money, don't increase workers, don't reduce production

    (Our newspaper's dispatch, reporter Sun Zunian): The part-work, part-study Red and Expert University students of the Harbin Linen Textile Factory have issued a heroic oath in their march towards culture, vowing to strive to become university graduates in five and a half years.
    The Harbin Linen Factory's part-work, part-study Red and Expert University, after half a month of preparation starting from September 22nd, officially opened on October 8th and started classes on the 12th. Studying in this part-work, part-study university are one thousand and nineteen workers from the preparation, processing, and combing workshops. In order to fully guarantee the workers' study time and realize the grand goal of graduating from university in five and a half years, after discussion by all employees, a method of tapping potential by exerting effort was adopted. Under the principle of not increasing the labor force, not reducing production, and ensuring that the total output value of the entire factory quadruples in the fourth quarter, it was unanimously agreed to implement the "six-two system," that is, the production time was changed from the eight-hour three-shift system to a six-hour four-shift system, implementing a system of six hours of production and two hours of study. To adapt to the changes in production time, the workers' dormitory was adjusted, the nursery was also changed to a four-shift reception, and the comrades in the canteen also started work early and finished late with revolutionary vigor, extending meal times to create favorable conditions for the four-shift production workers to study; in terms of curriculum arrangement, a combination of politics, culture, and technology was adopted, determining that sixteen hours per week would be used to study culture, two hours to study politics, and two hours to study technology. In addition to studying Chairman Mao's works, political lessons also combined the central work of the Party to study the Party's guidelines and policies; in the content of cultural and technical studies, junior high school and high school students will not only complete the main cultural courses of regular schools, but also complete intermediate technical courses, and university students will mainly study higher mathematics, mechanics, and thirty-three courses such as textile specialties. The issue of teachers is based on the principle of "those who are capable can be teachers," adopting a method of teaching and learning at the same time; everyone teaches and everyone learns, and on the basis of business reform, twenty full-time teachers were assigned to teach, and some technicians and staff members who graduated from universities and experienced old workers with many years of production experience were also hired as part-time teachers.
    For such a large number of workers to engage in part-work, part-study is not all smooth sailing. The Harbin Linen Factory's Party committee deeply realized during the Great Leap Forward in production that the development of the technological revolution must be accompanied by a cultural revolution, and only by gradually cultivating workers into intellectuals can a greater leap forward in production be realized. Therefore, it was proposed to start part-work, part-study in workshops with suitable conditions first. After this issue was raised, some leading cadres of the factory and some comrades in the labor and wage departments, due to insufficient understanding of the relationship between technological revolution and cultural revolution and the importance of cultivating the working class into intellectuals, did not adopt a positive and supportive attitude towards workers' part-work, part-study, but instead overemphasized difficulties, emphasizing that changes in the production system would disrupt production organization and affect production. They did not agree to change to a four-shift system with six hours of production to engage in part-work, part-study, arguing that there was a lack of labor, workers would have their wages reduced by 25%, and a series of problems such as dormitories, canteens, and nurseries could not be solved. To engage in part-work, part-study, more workers would have to be added to do it. In response to this conservative thinking, the Party committee proposed that part-work, part-study is the main form of running education in factories in the future, and it should be done wherever conditions permit. Should we ask the higher authorities for people and money to do it? Or should we tap our own potential, not increase workers, and not ask for money from above? On this issue, a great airing of views, a great debate, was launched among Party members, cadres, and workers.
    In the discussion, Party members, cadres, and the broad masses of workers actively supported part-work, part-study, and resolutely supported the Party committee's opinion. Cadres and workers in the preparation and processing workshops believed that the workers' lack of culture is a stumbling block to the technological revolution, and if it is not removed, it will affect the arrival of communism; part-work, part-study is the best way to cultivate working-class intellectuals in a faster, better, and more economical way, and it must be implemented. Then they used the method of tapping potential, adopting methods such as merging work types to reduce unnecessary procedures; changing manual inspection of fabric quality to machine inspection; expanding workers' viewing surface and reducing auxiliary workers; and cultivating all-rounders, so that four-shift production could be started without increasing workers; As for the issue of wage reduction, the workers viewed it this way: they said that this is not an insurmountable difficulty, we cannot sacrifice the long-term future of becoming university students for small immediate interests! Moreover, there are many young workers in our factory, and some do not have heavy burdens, while 80% of the families in the factory are engaged in factory production labor; now everyone has to make a Great Leap Forward! We can change the past small holidays to big holidays, and it is worth it to rest two days less a month in order to be the masters of science and culture, so that the monthly salary is only reduced by 12.2%, and some people get less than six or seven yuan, what does this count for? Workers who really have difficulties have been subsidized by the trade union in the past, and our workers can also help each other. We cannot think about a few dollars, but we must think about building communism! Cai Youyi, a worker in the processing workshop, said that I have long had the desire to study. In the past, I thought that I would work even if I was sent to school without taking money. Now there is part-work, part-study in the factory, which is really the best of both worlds. I work and study at the same time. In five to ten years, all the workers will become college students, so the bourgeois intellectuals will not cock their tails. Liu Renye, a worker in the preparation workshop, took the initiative to apply to go to the part-work, part-study Red and Expert University after returning home and re-arranging his life plan with his lover when he heard that the factory was going to run part-work, part-study. The enthusiasm of the workshop cadres and workers to overcome difficulties and their eagerness to learn swept away the difficulties raised by those who doubted part-work, part-study, and no one could be heard saying that this difficulty was impossible anymore.
    Now, all departments of the Harbin Linen Factory are actively and proactively helping to run the part-work, part-study Red and Expert University well, and all employees are actively preparing conditions for the full implementation of the four-shift six-hour production system by the end of the year, so that all employees can enter the part-work, part-study Red and Expert University.

    哈尔滨亚麻厂工人半工半读入红专大学
    六小时生产  两小时学习
    职工挖潜力，不向国家要钱，不增加工人，不降低生产
    本报讯　记者孙祖年报道：哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂半工半读红专大学学员们在向文化进军中发出豪迈的誓言，一定争取在五年半成为大学毕业生。
    哈尔滨亚麻厂半工半读红专大学，从9月22日起，经过半个月的筹备，已于10月8日正式开学，12日开课。在这个半工半读大学里学习的，有准备、加工、梳麻三个车间一千零十九名工人。为了充分地保证工人们的学习时间，实现五年半大学毕业的宏愿，经过全体职工讨论，通过发挥干劲挖潜力的办法，在不增加劳动力不降低生产，并保证全厂第四季度总产值翻两番的原则下，一致通过实行“六二制”，即生产时间由八小时的三班制改为六小时的四班制，实行六小时生产，二小时学习的制度。为适应生产时间的变化，工人宿舍作了调整，托儿所也改为四班收托，食堂的同志，也以革命的干劲早上班晚下班延长开饭时间，为四班生产的工人学习创造了有利条件；课程的安排上采取了政治、文化、技术三结合的办法，确定每周用十六小时学文化，二小时学政治，二小时学技术。政治课除学习毛主席著作外，还结合党的中心工作，学习党的方针政策；在文化、技术学习内容上，初中和高中不仅要学完正规学校的主要文化课程，而且还要学完中级技术课程，大学主要学习高等数学、力学以及纺织专业等三十三门课程，师资问题根据“能者为师”的原则采取一面教、一面学；大家教、大家学，并在业务改革的基础上，配备了二十名专职教员进行授课，一些在高等学校毕业的技术员和职员与有多年生产经验的老工人，也聘为兼职教员。
    在工人中，这样人数众多的实行半工半读，并不是一帆风顺的。哈尔滨亚麻厂党委，在生产大跃进中，就深刻意识到，技术革命的开展，必须同时进行文化上的革命，把工人逐步培养成为知识分子，才能实现生产上更大的跃进，因此提出先在有条件的车间开办半工半读的问题。当这个问题提出以后，厂的个别领导人员和劳动工资部门的部分同志，由于对技术革命和文化革命的关系，对培养工人阶级知识分子重要性认识不足，因此他们对工人半工半读不是采取积极支持的态度，而是过多地强调困难，强调生产制度的改变会打乱生产组织影响生产。他们不赞成改六小时生产的四班制来搞半工半读，理由是缺乏劳动力，工人要降低工资25％，宿舍、食堂、托儿所等等一连串问题无法解决。要搞半工半读就得增加工人才能办。针对这种保守思想，党委提出半工半读是今后工厂办教育的主要形式，凡是有条件的地方，都应当办起来。向上面要人要钱办呢？还是自己挖潜力，不增加工人、不向上要钱办呢？就此问题在党员、干部、工人中展开大鸣大放，大争大辩。
    在讨论中，党员、干部和广大工人，积极拥护半工半读，坚决支持党委的意见。准备、加工两车间的干部和工人认为，工人没有文化是技术革命的绊脚石，不搬掉它就影响共产主义的到来；半工半读是多快好省培养工人阶级知识分子的最好办法，一定要实行。接着他们用挖潜力的办法，采取了合并工种减少不必要的工序；把手工检查布的质量改为机器检布；扩大工人看台面，减少辅助工，培养多面手等办法，不需要增加工人就可以开四班生产；至于工资减少的问题，工人们是这样看待的，他们说，这也不是什么不可克服的困难，我们不能为了眼前小利益而误了长远的大学生的前程呀！何况我们厂内青工多，有的人负担并不重，而全厂80％家属都进了工厂生产劳动；现在是人人都要大跃进啊！可以把过去小礼拜改为大礼拜，为了做科学文化的主人，一个月少休息两天也是上算的，这样每月工资也不过只减少12.2％，有的人少拿还不到六、七元，这算得了什么，真正有困难的工人过去工会还有补助，咱们工人也可以互助。我们不能为了几块钱，而要为建设共产主义着想啊！加工车间工人蔡尤义说，我早就有学习的要求，过去我想，不拿钱送我去上学也干，现在厂里有了半工半读，这真是两全其美，又做工又学习，五年到十年以后工人都成了大学生，那资产阶级知识分子就不要翘尾巴了。准备车间工人刘仁业，听到厂里要办半工半读，回家和爱人一起重新安排生活计划后，主动要求上半工半读红专大学。车间干部和工人这种克服困难的干劲和迫切要求学习的积极性，把那些怀疑半工半读的人所提出的困难，一扫而尽，再也听不到有人说这困难那不行了。
    现在，哈尔滨亚麻厂各科室都主动积极地帮助办好半工半读红专大学，全厂职工正在为年底全部实行四班六小时生产制，让所有职工都进半工半读的红专大学而积极地准备条件。
