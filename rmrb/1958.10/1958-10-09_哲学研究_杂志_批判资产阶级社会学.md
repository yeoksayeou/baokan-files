    "Philosophical Research" Magazine
    Criticizes Bourgeois Sociology

    The upcoming issue of "Philosophical Research" (No. 6, 1958) will publish three articles: Hu Sheng's "The Significance of Importing Western Bourgeois Sociology into China," Zhuang Fuling's "We Cannot Ignore the Reactionary Political Influence of 'Principles of Sociology'," and Sun Benwen's "Criticizing the Bourgeois Ideology in My Old Work 'Principles of Sociology'."

    In his article, Hu Sheng pointed out that bourgeois sociology was imported into China from Western capitalist countries. In 1898-1903, Yan Fu translated Herbert Spencer's "An Introduction to the Study of Sociology," which marked the beginning of Western bourgeois sociology's entry into China. Yan Fu translated Spencer's book to resist the then Chinese bourgeois revolution. Hu Sheng pointed out that before the 1911 Revolution, in addition to Yan Fu's introduction of bourgeois sociology, some people compiled several sociology books based on Japanese works as models. This allowed modern American bourgeois sociology to enter China through the hands of the Japanese. Trafficking in these goods was also intended to oppose the bourgeois revolution. Hu Sheng also revealed the sinister intentions of imperialist countries, especially American imperialism, in promoting this sociology in China. He said that American sociology initially reached China via Japan. By the time of the May Fourth Movement, it was already being directly imported from the United States. At this time, Americans were teaching sociology courses in China, and sociology books translated from American sources began to be published. Due to the growing development of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people's revolutionary movement led by the Chinese proletariat, resisting this revolutionary movement and opposing Marxism became the tasks that bourgeois sociology attempted to undertake in China. Finally, Hu Sheng pointed out that modern Western bourgeois sociology also has the task of serving and adapting to the imperialist policies of aggression and domination over colonies. The so-called "cultural school" in bourgeois sociology particularly blatantly demonstrates this aspect of the task. They are particularly interested in "studying" the backward nations of colonies and dependencies, nominally calling it the study of various types of culture, but in reality, it is studying how to rule backward nations. Sun Benwen, Wu Wenzao, and Fei Xiaotong were all enthusiastic brokers for importing cultural school sociology into China. They imported this "doctrine" into China and conducted investigations and research on Chinese society according to this "doctrine" in order to turn China into an object of imperialist rule and to provide a so-called "scientific basis" for imperialists to rule China.

    In his article, Sun Benwen made a self-criticism of his old work "Principles of Sociology," expressing his desire to eliminate his academic ideology and carry out self-reform. In his article, Zhuang Fuling pointed out that Sun Benwen's expression of this desire for progress is welcome, but his self-criticism is unsatisfactory in terms of the basic assessment of this book, the criticism of its basic content, and the understanding of its reactionary influence. Therefore, Sun Benwen's self-criticism still needs to be greatly improved.

### “哲学研究”杂志  批判资产阶级社会学

    “哲学研究”杂志
    批判资产阶级社会学
    即将出版的一期“哲学研究”（1958年第六期）发表了胡绳的“西方资产阶级社会学输入中国的意义”、庄福龄的“不能忽视‘社会学原理’在政治上的反动影响”和孙本文的“批判我旧著‘社会学原理’中的资产阶级思想”三篇文章。
    胡绳在他的文章中指出，资产阶级社会学是从西方资本主义国家输入中国来的。1898—1903年严复翻译了斯宾塞的“社会学导言”一书，西方资产阶级社会学就在这时开始传入中国。严复翻译斯宾塞的书，为的是抵制当时中国资产阶级革命。胡绳指出：在辛亥革命以前，除了严复介绍资产阶级社会学以外，还有人以日本人的著作为蓝本而编译了几种社会学的书。这就使现代美国资产阶级社会学经过日本人的手输入中国。贩运这些货色也是为了反对资产阶级革命。胡绳还以事实揭露了帝国主义国家，特别是美帝国主义在中国推广这种社会学的凶恶目的。他说，美国的社会学最初是经过日本人而到中国的。到了五四运动时期，已经是从美国直接输入了。这时有美国人在中国讲社会学课程，从美国译来的社会学书籍也开始出版了。由于中国无产阶级领导的反帝反封建的人民革命运动日益发展，抵制这个革命运动，反对马克思主义，就成为资产阶级社会学在中国所企图担负的任务。最后，胡绳指出，现代西方的资产阶级社会学还具有服务于适应于帝国主义对殖民地的侵略和统治政策的任务。资产阶级社会学中的所谓“文化学派”，特别露骨地表现了这个方面的任务。他们特别有兴趣于“研究”殖民地附属国的落后民族，名义上叫做研究各类型的文化，实际上是研究用什么办法统治落后民族。孙本文、吴文藻和费孝通等都是把文化学派社会学输入中国的热心的掮客。他们把这种“学说”输入中国，并且按照这种“学说”来进行关于中国社会的调查研究，为的就是想使中国变成帝国主义统治的对象，为帝国主义者统治中国提供所谓“科学的基础”。
    孙本文在他的文章中对他的旧著“社会学原理”进行了自我批判，表示了要清除自己的学术思想和进行自我改造的愿望。庄福龄在他的文章中指出，孙本文这种要求进步的表现是值得欢迎的，但是他的自我批判在对于这本书的基本估计，对于它的基本内容的批判，以及对于它的反动影响的认识等方面，都是不能令人满意的。因此，孙本文的自我批判还需要大大地提高一步。
