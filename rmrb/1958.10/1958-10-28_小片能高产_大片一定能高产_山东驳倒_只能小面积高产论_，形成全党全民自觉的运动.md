Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th: Shandong Province's 25 million-strong autumn planting army has launched a massive and magnificent movement to create high-yield wheat "satellite fields," determined to use this as the key to drive the province's 70 million mu of wheat to achieve overall high yields. To concentrate efforts on large-area high-yield fields, the Provincial Party Committee recently revised the planned wheat planting area for this autumn from 80 million mu to 70 million mu, requiring 10 million to 15 million mu of wheat to yield 5,000 jin per mu next year, and 2 million mu to yield over 10,000 jin per mu.

Now, this movement has become a conscious movement of the whole Party and all the people in Shandong. Party secretaries at all levels, while focusing on steel production, are also personally going to the agricultural front lines to specifically work on "satellite fields" and check the quality of wheat planting. Cadres at all levels have adopted a system of responsibility at each level, with counties responsible for communes, communes responsible for production areas, and production areas responsible for production teams, all the way to harvest. People's communes in various places have formed numerous "satellite corps," dividing areas and plots, and planning yield targets, water and fertilizer measures, operating procedures, and management personnel into the fields, taking responsibility for planting, managing, and harvesting, all the way until the "satellites" are launched. For example, Shan County organized a 60,000-person satellite field army, fixed plots, and worked from planting to harvest. Now, this team is surveying the lush green wheat seedlings, classifying them, and carefully cultivating them. All seedlings that are piled up are appropriately thinned, those with fewer than thirty jin of seeds are re-sown, and water and fertilizer are added to third-class seedlings. They resolutely ensure that no seedlings are missing. The warriors fighting in the "satellite fields" in various places have dug underground houses next to the "satellite fields," and some have built warm shelters, preparing to accompany the wheat in the fields through the winter. Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries of the Secretariat Pei Mengfei and Teng Jinglu, personally cultivated wheat "satellite fields" and went to Dongjiao People's Commune in Licheng County to supervise and inspect the quality of wheat planting. They helped make up the lessons on the spot if they did not meet the standards. Comrade Shu Tong also personally held the seed drill to sow seeds.

The movement to launch large-area, high-yield "satellite fields" like a magnet attracts the masses. Satellite fields are models, driving the advancement of second- and third-class wheat fields throughout the province. For example, many places that used to have first-class seedlings, when compared with large-area "satellite fields" this year, have become second- or third-class seedlings. The commune members who were in charge of these seedlings were unwilling to show weakness, so they added water and fertilizer and quickly caught up with the "satellite fields," proposing to eliminate second- and third-class seedlings before the freeze. For example, Huang County, Shou Zhang, and Fan County all planted hundreds of thousands of mu of wheat, and they are all determined to become 10,000-jin wheat counties. They deeply plowed and leveled all wheat fields, finely raked and compacted them, and built ridges, making each plot like a vegetable garden, applying tens of thousands to millions of jin of base fertilizer per mu (including smoked fertilizer).

This movement was proposed by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee based on Chairman Mao's instructions for a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year and the spirit of the Autumn Agricultural Cooperation Conference of Nine Provinces and Cities held in Xi'an. The Provincial Party Committee believes that only by vigorously promoting large-area, high-yield "satellite fields" can we effectively increase yield per unit area and ensure the realization of the thousand-jin wheat province plan. Only by thinking boldly from the beginning and working unconventionally can we truly lay a solid foundation for high yields.

However, a few right-leaning conservatives have created a "only small area high yield theory" on this extremely important key issue to resist the large-area high-yield movement. They said, "It is possible to cultivate two or three mu of 10,000-jin wheat 'satellite fields,' but where would so much fertilizer and labor come from for large areas?" "Satellite fields can only be small plots, it is simply impossible to achieve full blooming." The masses in various places have conducted fierce airing of views and debates on these erroneous ideas and fallacies. Many places have used the experience of this year's high-yield wheat "satellite fields" and the lessons of third-class fields, as well as investigating potential and comparing measures, to refute this negative and conservative thinking. When Shou Zhang County unfolded discussions among all the people on whether the measures of wheat cultivation this year, which have increased by dozens of times compared with previous years, can launch satellites, the masses said: "How daring people are, how productive the land is. Boldly working unconventionally, daring to think and daring to act, can create miracles." After debates, the masses in many places have more deeply realized that: there are only low-yield ideas, not low-yield land. As long as we "start working at full capacity now, adding water, fertilizer, and effort," we can launch large-area wheat "high-yield satellites" next year.

### 小片能高产　大片一定能高产  山东驳倒“只能小面积高产论”，形成全党全民自觉的运动

    小片能高产　大片一定能高产
    山东驳倒“只能小面积高产论”，形成全党全民自觉的运动
    无数支“卫星兵团”分片划方一包到底
    力争放出一千多万亩小麦高产“卫星”
    新华社济南27日电　山东省两千五百万秋种大军，掀起一个声势浩大、规模壮阔的创造小麦大面积高额丰产“卫星田”运动，决心以此为纲带动全省七千万亩小麦同升高产宝帐。为了集中力量搞好大面积高额丰产田，最近省委将原定今秋种麦面积由八千万亩改为七千万亩，要求明年有一千万到一千五百万亩小麦亩产五千斤；二百万亩亩产一万斤以上。
    现在，这个运动已经成为山东全党全民的自觉运动。各级党委书记在大抓钢铁的同时，都亲临农业前线，具体搞“卫星田”，检查种麦质量。各级干部采取县包社、社包生产区，生产区包生产队等领导逐级包干负责制，一直包到收。各地人民公社，组成了无数支“卫星兵团”，分片划方，把产量指标、水、肥措施、操作规程、管理人等规划到田，包种、包管、包收，一直包到“卫星”上天。如单县组织了六万人的卫星野战兵团，固定地块，从种到收干到底。现在这支队伍，正在普查碧绿丛生的麦苗，分类排队，精心培育，凡是成堆成墩的麦苗都适当间苗，少数下种不足三十斤的一律又套播，对三类苗加水加肥，缺苗断垅的补种，他们要坚决保证不缺一株苗。各地奋战在“卫星田”的勇士们，有的在“卫星田”傍挖了地屋，有的搭起了暖和的窝铺，准备陪伴小麦在田间过冬。省委第一书记舒同和书记处书记裴孟飞、滕景禄等负责人，亲自培育小麦“卫星田”，并亲到历城县东郊人民公社督促检查种麦质量，不合规格的就地帮助补课，舒同同志还亲自扶耧播种。
    各地大放大面积高额丰产“卫星田”的运动，像磁石一样吸引着广大群众。卫星田是标兵，带动着全省二、三类麦田跃进。如许多地方在往年看来是一类的苗子，而今年和大面积“卫星田”一比却成了二、三类苗了。那些看管这类苗子的社员们不肯示弱，就加水加肥，快马加鞭的追赶“卫星田”，提出把二、三类苗消灭在封冻前。如黄县、寿张、范县都种有几十万亩小麦，他们都决心搞小麦万斤县。他们把所有麦田全部深翻整平，耙细塌实，修筑畦埂，块块达到菜园化，每亩施基肥几十万斤到几百万斤（包括熏肥在内）。
    这个运动是中共山东省委根据毛主席对明年农业生产要有一个更大跃进的指示和中央在西安召开的九省市秋季农业协作会议精神提出来的。省委认为只有大搞大面积高额丰产“卫星田”，才能有效的提高单位面积产量，确保小麦千斤省计划的实现。也只有一开始就大胆的想，破格的干，才能真正打下丰产的可靠基础。
    但是，有少数右倾保守主义者，在这个极为重要的关键问题上，又制造出一种“只能小面积高产论”，来抵抗大面积丰产运动。他们说“搞二、三亩万斤的小麦‘卫星田’还有可能，要是搞大面积哪里有这么多肥料和人工？”“卫星田只能是小块田，根本不可能全面开花”。各地群众对这些错误思想和错误论调，进行了激烈的鸣放辩论。许多地方拿出今年小麦“卫星田”的丰产经验和三类田的教训以及查潜力，比措施，来反驳这种消极保守思想。寿张县在全民中就今年小麦耕作措施比往年加大十几倍、几十倍能不能放大卫星的问题展开讨论时，群众说：“人有多大胆，地有多大产，大胆破格干，敢想敢干，才能创奇迹”。很多地方的群众经过辩论更加深刻地认识到：只有低产思想，没有低产土地。只要“现在就得开足马力放足劲，加水加肥加干劲”，明年就可以放出大面积小麦的“高产卫星”来。
