    Spiral Ascent
    Huagong
    The nation's steel production has made significant progress every month. Although coal production has also increased rapidly, it still cannot meet the needs of steel production. Therefore, how to continue to vigorously implement the "small-scale, indigenous groups" approach, so that small blast furnaces and small coal kilns are paired and advance together, is a matter worthy of attention at present.
    The development of small coal kilns is uneven. Some regions started earlier and production increased rapidly; some provinces have only implemented the "small-scale, indigenous groups" approach in some areas and have not yet blossomed everywhere; some places do not fully understand the role and power of "small-scale, indigenous groups," and the masses have not been mobilized. Due to this imbalance, it is necessary to treat each case differently: In some backward areas, the first thing to solve is the issue of popularization, to universally and massively mobilize the masses to develop small coal kilns to meet the coal needs of decentralized small blast furnaces. In particular, the coal-deficient provinces in the south need to accelerate their development efforts. In some advanced areas, the number of small coal kilns has developed a lot, and while continuing to popularize, it is urgently necessary to carry out production reform and technical transformation, extend the life of the mines, increase production, improve working conditions, and save manpower. Only in this way can we consolidate existing achievements, expand production, and meet the needs of steel production.
    Popularization and improvement cannot be completely separated. Improve on the basis of popularization, and further popularize under the guidance of improvement. This is almost the law of progress for various movements. Therefore, popularization will not only not hinder improvement, but will also provide a foundation for improvement. However, some comrades do not understand this relationship. They regard the "small-scale, indigenous groups" approach as a temporary measure to solve the problem of 10.7 million tons of steel, and therefore are satisfied with the widespread development of small coal kilns without paying attention to renovation; or they believe that renovation must adopt foreign methods and transform all small coal kilns into mechanized mines. We say that both of these views are wrong. Of course, the further development of "small-scale, indigenous groups" will gradually transition to "small-scale, foreign groups." But this transition must be gradually realized on the basis of popularization. From "small-scale, indigenous groups" to "small-scale, foreign groups," other than the difference between "indigenous" and "foreign," "small" and "groups" remain the same. If we forget this point, abandon "small," detach ourselves from the masses, and fantasize about reaching the sky in one step, it is unrealistic.
    In the past, we established tens of thousands of small coal kilns under the policy of "small-scale, indigenous groups." In the future, we will require those places with a foundation to gradually carry out technical reforms, and we must also adhere to the mass line. Improve on the basis of popularization, and then popularize under the guidance of improvement. Only in this way will our cause rise in a spiral.

    全国的钢铁生产，每月都有很大进展。煤炭产量虽然增长得也很快，仍然不能满足钢铁生产的需要。因此，怎样继续大力贯彻小土群方针，使小高炉和小煤窑成双成配，共同跃进，这是当前值得注意的问题。
    小煤窑的发展情况是不平衡的。有的地区动手较早，产量上升很快；有的省只在部分地区贯彻了小土群的方针，还没有遍地开花；有的地方对“小土群”的作用和威力认识不足，群众也没有发动起来。由于这种不平衡，也就需要分别对待：在一些落后的地区，首先需要解决的是普及问题，普遍地、大量地发动群众发展小煤窑，来满足分散的小高炉的用煤。特别是南方缺煤各省，尤需加速发展工作。而在另一些先进的地区，小煤窑的数量已发展得很多，在继续普及的同时，就迫切地需要进行生产改革和技术改造，延长矿井寿命，提高产量，改善劳动条件和节约人力。也只有这样才能巩固现有成绩，扩大生产，满足钢铁生产需要。
    普及与提高是不能截然分开的。在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下进一步普及。这几乎是各种运动的前进规律，所以，普及不但不会妨碍提高，反而能给提高以基础。但是，有些同志对这个关系弄不清楚，他们把“小土群”的方针看成是为解决一千零七十万吨钢的临时措施，因而满足于小煤窑遍地开花，而不重视改造；或者认为要改造就必须采用洋办法，把小煤窑全部改成机械化的矿井。我们说，这两种看法都是错误的。当然，“小土群”的进一步发展是会逐步过渡到“小洋群”的。但是这种过渡，一定要在普及的基础上逐步实现。从“小土群”到“小洋群”，除了“土”和“洋”有所不同以外，而“小”和“群”则仍然是相同的，如果忘记这一点，抛弃“小”的，脱离群众，幻想一步登天，这是不现实的。
    过去，我们在“小土群”的方针下办起了几万个小煤窑，今后，要求那些有基础的地方，逐步地进行技术改革，也必须坚持群众路线。在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下再普及。只有这样，我们的事业才会螺旋式地上升。
