Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th Dispatch: The U.S. government's policy of military provocations and war threats against China has been opposed by the majority of the American people. This situation has also greatly deepened the contradictions within the American ruling group, placing the Eisenhower-Dulles government in an extremely isolated position.

    People Dissatisfied with Government Policy
    According to a Gallup poll conducted at the end of September, as published in the "New York Herald Tribune," the vast majority of Americans surveyed disagreed with the government's policy and opposed war adventures in the Taiwan Strait. Another survey conducted by "Newsweek's" bureaus in 48 states in the United States drew the same conclusion. This magazine said in its October 6 issue that "it seems that much of the prestige and trust that Eisenhower once possessed has been lost" because "most Americans are now dissatisfied with his leadership." The magazine pointed out that one of the main aspects of the people's dissatisfaction is foreign policy, especially Far Eastern policy, because "most people are uneasy about the situation in Quemoy and Matsu. The public has repeatedly expressed unwillingness to fight for the coastal islands of China."

    Dulles Becomes the Target of Public Criticism
    A large number of American people have written letters to newspapers and the government, severely criticizing the Eisenhower-Dulles Far Eastern policy. This situation has forced many major American newspapers (such as "The Washington Post," "The New York Post," "The Wall Street Journal," and "The New York World-Telegram and The Sun," etc.) to dare not support the government's policy and instead join the ranks of attacking the government. "Time" magazine wrote on the 6th, describing the trend of American newspaper opinion today, that American "cartoonists, columnists, television commentators, and editors are all mocking Dulles, and the hostility is rarely seen for Dulles during a national crisis."
    According to American newspapers, people close to Dulles say that Dulles is "shocked" by newspaper attacks on the U.S. government's policy and public opposition. Dulles' embarrassment is "the first since becoming Secretary of State."

    Republican Reputation Plummets
    The American people's sharp opposition to the government's Far Eastern policy also seriously threatens the Republican Party's chances of winning this year's congressional elections, as a large number of voters are abandoning the Republican Party. According to "U.S. News & World Report," the Republican candidates are in an extremely unfavorable position in the congressional elections that have already begun in many states in the United States. In Maine, which is known as "as Maine votes, so votes the nation," the percentage of votes received by the Republican Senate candidate was the lowest in thirty years, and most of the state's seats in Congress were taken by the Democratic Party. In Utah, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, states with strong Republican influence, Democratic candidates also far outstripped Republicans in the primaries. It is said that the Democrats have predicted that they will win an "overwhelming victory" in the congressional elections that will be fully launched in November of this year, while Republicans generally express pessimism about the prospects for the campaign. "Newsweek" wrote on this point that the Republicans' "pessimism" is not without reason, because the American people are "dissatisfied with the government's Quemoy and Matsu policy. Republican strategists worry that this issue will cost the Republican Party more votes than the economic recession and the Adams affair."
    Democrats to End "Honeymoon"
    Democratic politicians have precisely seized the opportunity, so they have recently announced the end of the "honeymoon" of bipartisan foreign policy unity with the Republican Party and joined the siege of the Eisenhower administration. Democratic Senator Morse said bluntly when commenting on U.S. Far Eastern policy, "This villain (Dulles) who is leaning towards war must be stopped." Senator Kennedy, who intends to run for the 1960 Democratic presidential candidate, also said that the United States has been plunged into the "Quemoy and Matsu crisis," which is the responsibility of Dulles. Some leading figures of the Democratic Party, such as Democratic leader Stevenson, former Secretary of State Acheson, Senate Democratic Deputy Leader Mansfield, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Humphrey, have also come out to attack the Republican government.
    In the Democratic Party's attacks on the Republican government, a letter from Senator Green, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democratic senator, to Eisenhower has received great attention, because Green is a powerful figure, and Eisenhower has had to reply to Green in order to defend the U.S. government's policy of aggression, expressing his hope that the government's policy can be understood by the Democratic Party. According to "The New York Times," Green expressed "deep concern about the U.S. government's decision on Quemoy and Matsu" in his letter to Eisenhower. Green warned that the events in the Far East have drawn the United States into a military action "taken on issues that are not of significant importance to U.S. security and without the support of allies. It is an action taken at an inappropriate time and in an inappropriate place." But Green, like many other Democrats, is only afraid that the U.S. government's adventurous policy has gone too far; he does not truly oppose interference in China's internal affairs, because the resolution passed by Congress in January 1955 to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan was passed with the consent of the Democratic Party.

    Opponents Within the State Department
    On the Republican side, many important members of Congress, including many who have always firmly supported the Chiang Kai-shek group, have recently remained silent and dare not come out to defend the government's Far Eastern policy. According to American newspapers, there is now a "group of middle-level cadres" within the State Department who are opposing Dulles' handling of the Far Eastern situation. This group is not only dissatisfied with Dulles' attitude towards the Quemoy and Matsu issue, but also dissatisfied with his support for Chiang Kai-shek. They believe that Dulles is "completely unrealistic." It is said that they deliberately provided information to the press about a large number of people writing to the U.S. government opposing U.S. Far Eastern policy.

    天怒人怨　众叛亲离
    华盛顿对华政策在国内遭围攻
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁政策遭到美国大多数人民的反对，这种情况并且大大加深了美国统治集团内部的矛盾，使艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯政府的处境极端孤立。
  人民不满政府政策
    据“纽约先驱论坛报”刊载的盖洛普民意测验所在9月底进行的一次调查，绝大多数被征询意见的美国人都不同意政府的政策，反对在台湾海峡地区进行战争冒险。“新闻周刊”驻在美国四十八个州的采访站进行的另一个调查也得出同样的结论。这家杂志在10月6日的一期中说，“看来艾森豪威尔一度拥有的威信和信任已经失去了不少”，因为“美国现在大多数人民都不满意他的领导”。杂志指出，人民的不满的一个主要方面是对外政策、特别是远东政策，因为“大多数人对金门和马祖的局势感到不安。老百姓一次又一次表示不愿意为中国沿海岛屿而战。”
  杜勒斯成众矢之的
    大批的美国人民写信给报纸和政府，对艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的远东政策提出严厉的批评。这种情势已迫使美国许多大报（如：“华盛顿邮报”、“纽约邮报”、“华尔街日报”、“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”等）不敢支持政府的政策，而宁愿投入对政府进行抨击的行列中。“时代”周刊6日在描述美国今天的报纸舆论趋势时写道，美国的“漫画家、专栏作家、电视评论员和编辑们都在挖苦杜勒斯，其敌意是杜勒斯在一个国家危机时期少见的”。
    据美国报刊透露，接近杜勒斯的人说，杜勒斯对于报纸对美国政府政策的攻击和公众的反对感到“震惊”。杜勒斯的尴尬程度是“担任国务卿以来的第一次”。
  共和党声望大跌落
  美国人民对政府远东政策的尖锐反对也严重地威胁到共和党在今年国会选举中的取胜机会，因为大批选民正在摒弃共和党。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，在目前已经开始的美国许多州的国会议员选举中，共和党的候选人处境都极为不利。在号称“缅因怎样投票，全国就怎样投票”的缅因州，共和党参议员候选人获得的票数百分比是三十年来最少的，这个州在国会中的大多数席位都给民主党占去。在犹他、威斯康星和明尼苏达等共和党势力雄厚的州里，民主党的候选人在预选中也比共和党人遥遥领先。据说，民主党人已经预言，他们在到今年11月全面展开的国会选举中将会获得“压倒的胜利”，而共和党人对竞选前景却普遍表示悲观。“新闻周刊”就这一点写道，共和党人的“悲观”不是没有理由的，因为美国人民“对政府的金门和马祖政策不满。共和党的战略家们担心，这个问题势将比经济衰退问题和亚当斯事件更使共和党丧失选票”。民主党要结束“蜜月”
    民主党的政客们正是看准了风头，所以最近也宣布结束同共和党两党一致外交的“蜜月”，参加对艾森豪威尔政府的围攻。民主党参议员莫尔斯在评论美国远东政策时不客气地说，“必须制止（杜勒斯）这个倒向战争的恶棍”。打算出任1960年民主党总统候选人的参议员肯尼迪也说，美国已经陷入了“金门和马祖的危机”中，这需由杜勒斯来负责。民主党一些头面人物，例如民主党领袖史蒂文森、前国务卿艾奇逊、参议院民主党副领袖曼斯菲尔德、参议院外交委员会委员汉弗来等人也都出来攻击共和党政府。
    在民主党对共和党政府的攻讦中，参议院外交委员会主席、民主党参议员格林给艾森豪威尔的信受到很大重视，因为格林是当权人物，艾森豪威尔为了替美国政府的侵略政策辩解，已不得不回了一封信给格林，表示希望政府的政策能够得到民主党的谅解。据“纽约时报”报道，格林在给艾森豪威尔的信中对“美国政府关于金门岛和马祖岛的决定表示深切不安”。格林警告说，远东的事件使美国卷入了这样一种军事行动，“这种军事行动是由于对美国安全没有重要意义的问题而采取的，而且没有盟国的支持。这是一个在不适当的时间、不适当的地点采取的行动”。但是格林和其他许多民主党人一样，害怕的只是美国政府的冒险政策做得过分，他并不真正反对干涉中国内政，因为1955年1月国会通过的目的在于阻挠中国人民解放台湾的决议正是在民主党的同意下通过的。
  国务院内有反对派
    在共和党方面，许多重要的国会议员，包括许多一向坚决支持蒋介石集团的议员，近来都保持沉默，不敢出来为政府的远东政策辩护。据美国报刊说，在国务院内部现在有一个“中级干部集团”正在反对杜勒斯处理远东局势的办法，这批人不但不满杜勒斯对金门和马祖问题的态度，而且也不满他支持蒋介石的态度。他们认为，杜勒斯是“彻底不现实”的。据说最近向报界提供关于大批人民写信给美国政府反对美国远东政策的消息就是他们故意这样做的。
