Editorial Notes

    Resolutely Implement the "Constitution"

    Water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density are the "constitution" of agricultural production, and the key to achieving a bumper harvest. Therefore, resolutely implementing this "constitution" in this year's autumn sowing work is decisive for a bumper summer harvest next year.

    The Heping People's Commune has achieved very good quality in this year's autumn sowing, achieving cultivated fields that resemble gardens, and standardized technical quality. The fundamental reason for this is precisely because the commune's Party committee has a clear understanding of the idea of resolutely implementing the "constitution" and has good leadership methods. They made it clear that water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density are the keys to a bumper harvest and must be grasped simultaneously; poor sowing quality this year will affect next year's harvest. Therefore, they adopted a relatively good leadership method – running field training classes, allowing tens of thousands of production backbone members to master the quality requirements and specifications of autumn sowing work while learning and doing, and spreading the experience of large experimental fields to all wheat fields in the commune through them. This makes the autumn sowing work both fast and good.

    The experience of Heping Commune shows that as long as the leadership's thinking is clear and the leadership methods are good, it is entirely possible to meet the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical in this year's autumn plowing and sowing.

### 坚决执行“宪法”

    坚决执行“宪法”
    水、肥、土、种、密是农业生产上的“宪法”，是能不能取得丰收的关键。因此，在今年的秋播工作中，坚决执行这个“宪法”，对明年夏熟丰收具有决定性的作用。
    和平人民公社今年秋播的质量很好，做到了耕作园田化，技术质量规格化。做得好的根本原因，正是由于公社党委坚决执行“宪法”的思想明确，领导方法好。他们明确了水、肥、土、种、密是丰收的关键，必须一齐抓；今年播种质量不好，就会影响到明年的丰收。因此，采取了比较好的领导方法——办田间训练班，让成万名生产骨干分子在边学边做中，掌握秋播工作的质量要求和规格，通过他们把大片试验田的经验在全社三麦地上推广。这就使得秋播工作既快且好。
    和平公社的经验说明，只要领导思想明确，领导方法好，今年的秋耕秋种是完全可能达到多快好省的要求的。
