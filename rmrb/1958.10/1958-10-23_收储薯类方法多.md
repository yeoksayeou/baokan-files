Many Methods for Storing Potatoes and Root Crops

Shredded Sweet Potatoes Can Be Pressed Before Drying

The customary method for making dried sweet potatoes is to first shred or slice them, then dry them in the sun. However, the sweet potato harvest season is approaching early winter, with shorter daylight hours and uncertain rainfall.

In order to accelerate the drying time of sweet potatoes, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture conducted an experiment in Wenling to press out some of the water from the sweet potatoes before drying them. The results showed that the drying time for pressed shredded sweet potatoes was reduced by half compared to unpressed ones, and the moisture content of the dried shreds was also 1.7% lower. This indicates that pressing before drying is a better method for accelerating the drying process. At the same time, there are many tools that can be used for pressing. The extracted water can be settled to extract some starch, without much loss.

Temporary Storage in Fields and Plots

Before the freeze, Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province had already dug up all 2.2 million mu of potatoes in the region. One-third had been put into cellars, and the rest were stored in open-air cellars in the fields and plots, covered with秸秆 (stalks and stems of crops) and soil for preservation, ready for transportation and processing. More than 5,000 small processing plants have been established throughout the region, and the processing equipment is also ready. All tasks, from production to harvesting and processing, are being carried out in an orderly manner.

Yanbei is vast and sparsely populated, and the harvest time has always been very long. This year, in response to the new situation of a bumper harvest and labor shortages, various localities have adopted the method of concentrating manpower, concentrating time, and fighting a quick battle. While ensuring the task of steel production, they organized an army for harvesting potatoes, establishing militarized professional organizations for agricultural tasks such as digging, transporting, drying, selecting, and storing. This greatly accelerated the harvest progress, and the task was completed in fifteen days.

Consumers Dig and Transport Themselves

In order to help farmers solve the problem of labor shortage during the sweet potato harvest, students from the Department of Industrial Economics of Renmin University of China brought their own tools such as iron shovels, carrying poles, and carts to dig up and collect the sweet potatoes ordered by the school in the Dazhongsi People's Commune in Haidian District, and transported them back to the school after digging.

Because the school leaders had explained the current labor shortage in rural areas to the students in advance and made sufficient mobilization, the students were very enthusiastic. Although it was raining lightly on the 11th, everyone actively dug up sweet potatoes, and in less than two hours, they dug up more than 10,000 jin of fresh potatoes. They not only dug quickly but also carefully, and there were very few cases of lost potatoes. The People's Commune welcomed their approach very much.

    收储薯类方法多
    薯丝可先榨后晒
    番薯制干的方法，习惯上都是先刨丝切片，后晒干。但是番薯收获季节已届初冬，日照渐短，阴雨不定。
    浙江省农业厅为了加速甘薯的晒干时间，曾在温岭作了一次把番薯先压榨出一些水份再晒干的试验。试验结果是，压榨后的薯丝，曝晒时间比不压榨的可减少一半，干丝含水份也要低1.7％。由此可以看出，先榨后晒是一种较好的加速晒干方法。同时，用作压榨的工具很多。榨出的水份经过沉淀，还可提取部分淀粉，没有多大损失。
    暂储田间地头
    山西省雁北专区已经在结冰前把全区二百二十多万亩马铃薯已经全部刨挖出土，三分之一已入了窖，其余部分都安置在田间、地头露天窖，用秸秆和土复盖藏好，准备运输和加工。全区共建立起五千多个小型加工厂，加工设备也已准备齐全。从生产到收获、加工处理各项工作有条不紊。
    雁北地广人稀，历来收获时间拉得很长。今年各地针对大丰收和劳力紧张的新形势，采取了集中人力、集中时间、速战速决的办法，在保证钢铁生产任务的同时，组织了一支收山药蛋大军，按挖、运、晒、选、储藏等农活建立了军事化的专业组织。这样就大大加快了收获进度，前后十五天就大功告成。
    消费者自刨自运
    为了帮助农民解决白薯收获中劳动力不足的问题，北京人民大学工业经济系同学，自己带着铁铣、扁担、小车等工具，到海淀区大钟寺人民公社去刨收学校订购的白薯，并在刨收以后运回学校。
    由于学校领导上事先向同学们讲清了当前农村劳动力不足的情况，做了充分的动员工作，同学们劲头很足。11日虽然下着小雨，大家还是积极刨收，不到两小时就刨出了一万来斤鲜薯。他们不但刨的快而且刨得细致，很少有丢薯情况。人民公社对他们这种做法非常欢迎。
