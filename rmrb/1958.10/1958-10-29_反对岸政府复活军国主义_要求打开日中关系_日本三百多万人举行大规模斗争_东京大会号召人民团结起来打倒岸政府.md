Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: More than 3.5 million workers and students in Japan held massive demonstrations across the country today to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to turn Japan into a police state again and to demand the opening of the deadlocked Sino-Japanese relations.

More than 3 million workers from all unions affiliated with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), including the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union, and the All-Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union, held 30-minute and 1-hour workplace rallies or strikes in various locations today, strongly protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law."

350,000 members of the Japan Teachers' Union participated in today's struggle. Teachers in Kochi and Gunma prefectures took the whole day off, while teachers in other areas took time off from 2:00 PM. The teachers held workplace rallies, firmly opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and the implementation of the "Service Evaluation" system.

At the same time, many neutral unions also held workplace rallies today.

More than 300,000 university students from 146 student self-government associations at 82 universities affiliated with the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations (Zengakuren) held a nationwide general strike today. In the morning, students held rallies at their respective schools demanding the withdrawal of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." In the afternoon, they participated in local mass rallies in 62 cities.

In Tokyo today, 80,000 workers and students braved the rain to hold a "Central National Conference Opposing the Revision of the Police Duties Execution Law, Defending Livelihood, Rights and Education, and Opening Sino-Japanese Relations" at four venues, including Hibiya Park.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution strongly opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's malicious revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" and firmly declared that it would use the strength of a general strike by all workers and the unity of all people to crush this anti-law bill and fight to the end to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet.

The conference also unanimously adopted a resolution opposing the "Service Evaluation" system and demanding the protection of democratic education. The resolution called on the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet to take measures to restore Sino-Japanese trade and promote the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and also demanded the establishment of a minimum wage system.

The conference concluded with a declaration calling on the people of the whole country to form a united front and launch a joint struggle to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke government and Japanese monopoly capital from following and colluding with US imperialism to restore the police state and to establish a system for invading Asian countries.

Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, Communist Party of Japan Central Committee Chairman Nosaka Sanzō, and General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji addressed the meeting. They firmly stated their determination to prevent the passage of the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." Miyamoto Kenji pointed out that the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, trade unions, and various democratic groups have united to establish a joint struggle organization to crush the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill." This is the first step towards the great unity of the Japanese nation and marks the beginning of the Japanese people's march towards the bright road of final victory.

The masses gathered at the Hibiya Park Open-Air Music Hall welcomed the congratulatory messages from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions with enthusiastic applause.

After the conference, all participants from the four venues divided into four routes and held demonstrations in the streets. National Conference in Tokyo on Opening Sino-Japanese Relations and Prohibiting Nuclear Armament. Tokyo Telephoto from Xinhua News Agency.
