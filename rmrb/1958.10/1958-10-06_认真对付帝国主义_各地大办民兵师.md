Seriously Deal with Imperialism
All Regions Vigorously Establish Militia Divisions
Capital Forms 155 Divisions
30 Million People in Sichuan Province Participate in the Militia
Shandong Has Already Achieved Universal Military Service

(Dispatch from our newspaper) A massive nationwide movement for universal military service has achieved brilliant results in the capital. As of the 4th, 2.2 million people in the city had signed up to join the militia, forming 155 divisions, 345 independent militia regiments, 392 independent militia battalions, and 453 independent militia companies. This force, composed of workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, is now conducting intensive military training while holding weapons, awaiting the call of the motherland. Simultaneously, it is contributing to the capital's economic construction with a new approach of "militarizing actions, collectivizing life, and militarizing organization."

Since American imperialism intensified its war provocations against our country in the Taiwan Strait area, the people of the city have been filled with indignation. In order to defend the motherland, defend peace, and strike against aggressors, they are eager to sign up for the militia and demand to be armed. For example, more than 2,600 employees of the Doudian Brick and Tile Factory jointly and individually wrote more than 1,500 big-character posters requesting to join the militia. Teachers and students of the Beijing Institute of Technology organized special militia divisions and conducted intensive drills. On the day the militia division was officially established, a military parade was held. The soldiers of the artillery regiment, motorized infantry regiment, and light and heavy machine gun regiment were all radiant and marched vigorously. They unanimously shouted: "Study diligently and practice hard, be both cultured and martial, be ready at all times, defend the motherland!" The entire faculty, staff, and students of the college also solemnly swore: To be red fighters defending socialist construction and defending world peace; to be versatile individuals who are both students, workers, farmers, and soldiers; to actively participate in military training, master weapons and communication skills, and be ready for the call of the motherland at any time! If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate them.

Along with the establishment of militia organizations, a high tide of intensifying military training has been set off throughout the city. Now, whether in factories, enterprises, government agencies, or rural areas, military training is being conducted everywhere, and some have already achieved good results. For example, the militia of five townships in Chaoyang District, using the method of combining labor and military affairs, implemented the principle of "small training during busy times, large training during less busy times, and no training during intensive production," and conducted military training for the militia. The overall evaluation of the first live-fire practice with rifles achieved excellent results. More than 6,000 teachers and students of Tsinghua University recently held joint operations exercises of various arms of service after 20 days of training. They believe that this has greatly benefited their political thinking and their skills in defending the motherland.

The movement of universal military service has greatly promoted industrial and agricultural production in the capital. Now, the militia soldiers on all production fronts in the city are leaping forward with soaring enthusiasm and heroic strides. For example, after the establishment of the militia division of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Changping District, they immediately put forward the slogan of action: "One hand with a hoe, one hand with a gun, defend the motherland and protect our homes." More than 20,000 people in the entire division immediately joined the battle to intensively plow the wheat fields and rush to plant wheat. After three days and nights of hard work, they completed the task of intensively plowing more than 32,000 mu of wheat fields and rushing to plant wheat two days ahead of schedule. The officers and soldiers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Workers' Militia Regiment are fighting hard to complete the annual production target of 560,000 tons of steel. The soldiers of the transportation company militia platoon of this factory, in order to change the backlog of transportation, used their rest time to complete the loading and unloading of 402 tons of coal and ore. The militia soldiers of the rail sleeper workshop of the Fengtai Bridge Factory picked up more than 200 tons of scrap steel, ensuring the supply of raw materials and the completion of production tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 5th. Sichuan Province is accelerating the realization of universal military service. At present, the province's militia has reached 30 million, becoming a strong reserve force for national defense and a production shock force.

In the past month or so, militia organizations have been established in rural areas, factories, schools, and government agencies throughout the province, and military training has been launched. The worker armed basic battalion organized by the Chengdu Copper Wire Factory uses two hours of military training every day after dinner. Within a month, they have all mastered basic military skills such as aiming, shooting, holding a gun, carrying a gun, and throwing grenades. In September, five militia regiments were organized in the suburbs of Chengdu in a few days, with more than 87,000 militiamen, basically realizing universal militarization. While rushing to harvest and plant, they carried out military training such as tactics, weapons, queues, and grenade throwing.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th. In the tide of anger against American imperialism's war provocations, the militia force in Shandong Province has rapidly developed from 15 million to 25 million. The province has already achieved universal military service.

In recent days, basic militia in various parts of the province have been actively carrying out military training, and each combat unit has a number of demobilized soldiers with rich combat experience serving as military instructors. The armed militia in the Linyi area, led by demobilized and transferred soldiers, are practicing martial arts intensely while producing. In the Changwei area, there are more than 900,000 militiamen who are simply never separated from their guns on the steel and agricultural fronts, and practice martial arts as soon as they rest. In Weihai City, which is located on the coastal defense line, many militiamen carry a shovel on one shoulder and a gun on the other when they go up the mountain; their clothes are soaked with sweat when they learn to crawl forward, and many people's arms are bleeding, but they still insist on hard training.

At present, in addition to stepping up training, the vast number of militiamen in Shandong Province are actively taking on the role of the main force on the steel and grain production fronts. Junan County organized a labor army of 500,000 people, with more than 70,000 militiamen as the backbone, and invested in the steel production and deep plowing campaign. After Foreign Minister Chen Yi issued a statement, the Iron and Steel Militia Basic Regiment of Zhulong Township in this county immediately held a mobilization meeting at the construction site, unanimously put forward the slogan: "Work during the day, work at night, vow to double the steel production," and more than 1,000 people in the entire regiment worked hard for three days and nights, digging out 2,500 tons of ore.

    认真对付帝国主义
    各地大办民兵师
    首都组成一百五十五个师
    四川省三千万人参加民兵
    山东已经实现了全民皆兵
    本报讯　一个声势浩大的全民皆兵运动，在首都已取得了辉煌的成绩，截至4日止，全市已有二百二十万人报名参加了民兵，组成了一百五十五个师，三百四十五个民兵独立团，三百九十二个民兵独立营，四百五十三个民兵独立连。这支亦工、亦农、亦商、亦学、亦兵的队伍，现在正一面手执武器，进行紧张的军事训练，等待着祖国的召唤；一面以“行动战斗化，生活集体化，组织军事化”的新面貌，进行着首都的经济建设。
    自从美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区加紧对我国进行战争挑衅以来，全市人民愤不可遏，为了保卫祖国、保卫和平、打击侵略者，他们迫不及待地报名参加民兵，要求武装起来。如窦店砖瓦厂的二千六百余职工，联名和单独写了一千五百多张大字报，要求参加民兵。北京工业学院的师生员工们，组织了特种民兵师，进行了紧张的操练。在民兵师正式成立的那天，还举行了阅兵式，各受阅的炮兵团、摩托化兵团和轻重机枪兵团的战士们，个个容光焕发，步伐矫健。一致高呼：“勤学苦练，文武双全，时刻准备，捍卫祖国”。学院的全体师生员工们，也一致庄严地宣誓：要做保卫社会主义建设，保卫世界和平的红色战士，要做亦学亦工亦农亦兵的多面手，积极参加军事训练，熟练手中武器和通讯技能，随时准备着祖国召唤！如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，就坚决、彻底、全部的消灭他们。
    随着民兵组织建立的同时，全市也掀起了一个加紧军事训练的高潮，现在不论在厂矿、企业、机关或农村，到处都在进行军事训练，有的已取得了良好的成绩。如朝阳区五个乡的民兵，以劳武结合的方法，贯彻了“大忙小训、小忙大训，突击生产不训”的生产、训练两不误的原则，对民兵进行了军事训练，步枪实弹第一练习总评取得了优秀的成绩。清华大学六千多名师生，经过二十天的训练，最近举行了各兵种联合作战演习。他们认为这对他们的政治思想和保卫祖国的技能都有很大收获。
    全民皆兵运动，大大的促进了首都的工农业生产。现在全市各个生产战线上的民兵战士们，都以冲天的干劲和豪迈的步伐向前跃进。如昌平区东风人民公社民兵师成立后，他们立刻提出了“一手锄头一手枪、捍卫祖国保家乡”的行动口号。全师二万多人立刻投入了麦地深翻和小麦抢种的突击战。经过三昼夜的奋战，即提前二天完成了三万二千多亩麦地深翻和小麦抢种任务。石景山钢铁工人民兵团的官兵们，正在为完成年产五十六万吨钢铁任务而奋战。这个厂运输部民兵连的战士们，为了改变运输积压状态，他们利用休息时间完成了四百零二吨的煤炭和矿石的装卸任务。丰台桥梁厂的轨枕车间的民兵战士们，拣了废钢铁二百多吨，保证了原材料的供应和生产任务的完成。
    新华社成都5日电　四川省正在加速实现全民皆兵。目前，全省民兵已达到三千万，成为一支强大的国防后备军和生产突击队。
    最近一个多月以来，全省的农村、工厂、学校、机关都纷纷成立了民兵组织，并展开军事训练。成都铜线厂组织的工人武装基干营，每天利用晚饭后的时间，进行两小时的军事训练。他们在一个月内就全部掌握了瞄准、射击、握枪、持枪、投弹等基本军事技术。成都郊区在9月份几天内就组织了五个民兵团，八万七千多民兵，基本实现了全民军事化。他们在抢收抢种的同时，展开了战术、兵器、队列、投弹等军事训练。
    新华社济南5日电　在反对美帝国主义战争挑衅的怒潮中，山东省的民兵队伍由一千五百万迅速地发展到二千五百万。全省已经实现了全民皆兵。
    连日来，全省各地基干民兵都在积极进行军事训练，各战斗单位都有一批富有战斗经验的复员军人充任军事教员。临沂地区武装起来的民兵，在复员转业军人的带领下，一面生产，一面紧张地进行练武。昌潍地区有九十多万民兵，他们在钢铁和农业战线上，简直是枪不离身，一休息就练武。处在海防线上的威海市，许多民兵每逢上山时，都是一肩扛锨，一肩背枪；他们在学习匍匐前进动作时，汗水湿透了衣裳，不少人胳膊磨出了血，还是坚持进行苦练。
    目前，山东省广大民兵除了加紧训练以外，正积极地担当起钢铁、粮食生产战线上的主力军。莒南县以七万多名民兵为骨干，组织了五十万人的劳动大军，投入钢铁生产和深翻土地的运动。在陈毅外长发表声明以后，这个县朱隆乡钢铁民兵基干团立即在工地上举行了誓师大会，一致提出：“白天干，黑夜干，誓把钢铁翻一番”的口号，全团一千多人苦干了三昼夜，挖出矿石二千五百吨。
