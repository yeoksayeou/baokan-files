Xinhua News Agency, Yaoundé, October 5th: While using coercion and enticement to force Cameroon to accept De Gaulle's "referendum" fraud, the French colonialists are also intensifying political repression in Cameroon and canceling all rights to political activity for Cameroonians.

The French authorities have forced the so-called Cameroonian government to accept the following regulations: 1. Nighttime curfew; 2. Prohibition of collective passes; 3. Prohibition of meetings of more than three people. Moreover, in many parts of Cameroon, the French colonial military authorities have also implemented even more barbaric regulations. The French colonial army has received the strictest orders to establish the harshest police system locally. Many residents have been driven from their villages into concentration camps in the jungle, guarded by the army.

Reports say that the armed struggle in Cameroon is developing. Cameroonians are constantly carrying out armed attacks on French colonialists. France is now forced to transfer reinforcements to Cameroon from various locations. These reinforcements come from Morocco, Tunisia, and other parts of Africa. The French garrison has increased from 14,000 five years ago to 60,000 today. In addition, a large number of aircraft and armored vehicles have been shipped in.

Reports point out that the political struggle in Cameroon is also fierce. Cameroonians are intensifying their struggle to break away from French rule and strive for independence. In order to deceive the local residents, the French authorities are also using their puppets in Cameroon to demand that Cameroonians accept so-called "gradual independence" from the French. However, the political scams of the past few years have fully demonstrated that "gradual independence" is a tactic used by the French authorities to buy time in order to intensify the organization of puppet parties and puppet governments, characterized by the intensification of the most barbaric police repression measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 5th: The spokesman for the Cameroonian People's Union, Osendé, held a press conference here on the 4th.

At the press conference, Osendé exposed the repressive measures taken by the French colonial authorities in Cameroon against the Cameroonian people's struggle for independence, such as merging villages, imposing curfews, and banning markets. He revealed that there are now 60,000 French troops in Cameroon, whereas in normal times the number of French troops never exceeds 2,000. Osendé said that of the 3.5 million residents in eastern Cameroon, 50,000 patriotic fighters are imprisoned in concentration camps.

He said that despite this, the underground struggle of the Cameroonian people is constantly developing. Osendé called on world public opinion, all peace-loving people, and governments opposed to colonialism—especially the governments of Asian, African, and Latin American countries—to support the Cameroonian people's struggle.

Osendé pointed out that recently an American radio station spread rumors that the General Secretary of the Cameroonian People's Union, Um Nyobé, had died. Then, the American embassy in Cairo contacted the Cairo office of the Cameroonian People's Union to ask if they had a new person to replace Nyobé. Osendé announced that Nyobé is still alive and well. He pointed out that the purpose of this rumor is to weaken the Cameroonian people's will to fight for independence. He emphasized, "There is no political vacuum in our country. We do not need their doctrines, nor do we need their people."

Osendé stated that the UN investigation team, led by a U.S. representative, scheduled to inspect Cameroon next month is unlikely to be of any use. He advocated sending an investigation team to Cameroon with representatives from Asian and African countries, in which the number of representatives from Asian and African countries is proportional to their importance in the world family. He pointed out that the Arab League had made this suggestion at a meeting held last month.

Osendé demanded that the United Nations order the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Cameroon.

Commenting on Guinea's recent declaration of independence, Osendé said, "Any victory over imperialism is also our victory." He also said that the Cameroonian People's Union is very pleased with Guinea's independence.

    法国殖民当局野蛮镇压变本加厉
    喀麦隆人民加紧斗争争取独立
    人民联盟发言人谴责殖民主义者罪行
    新华社5日讯　喀麦隆雅温得消息：法国殖民主义者在用威迫利诱的办法来强使喀麦隆接受戴高乐的“公民投票”骗局的同时，还采取各种手段在喀麦隆加紧政治镇压和取消喀麦隆人的一切政治活动权利。
    法国当局已强迫所谓喀麦隆政府接受下列法规：一、夜间禁止通行；二、禁止使用集体通行证；三、禁止举行三人以上的会议。而且，在喀麦隆的许多地方，法国殖民军事当局还实行一些更为野蛮的规定。法国殖民军队得到最严格的命令，要在当地建立起最厉害的警察制度。许多居民从村落里被赶到丛林中的集中营里，由军队看守着。
    消息说，喀麦隆的武装斗争正在发展中。喀麦隆人不断对法国殖民主义者进行武装袭击。法国现在被迫从各地调援军到喀麦隆。这些援军来自摩洛哥、突尼斯和非洲其他地区。法国的驻军已从五年前的一万四千人增加到现在的六万人。此外还运来了大量的飞机和装甲汽车。
    消息指出，喀麦隆的政治斗争也很激烈。喀麦隆人正在加紧为摆脱法国统治，争取独立而斗争。而法国当局为了欺骗当地居民，也正在通过它在喀麦隆的走狗要求喀麦隆人从法国人手里接受所谓“逐步的独立”。但是过去几年的政治骗局已经完全表明“逐步的独立”是法国当局骗取时间以便加紧组织傀儡政党和傀儡政府的手法，其特点是加紧运用最野蛮的警察镇压措施。
    新华社开罗5日电　喀麦隆人民联盟发言人奥森德4日在这里举行了记者招待会。
    奥森德在记者招待会上揭露喀麦隆的法国殖民当局对喀麦隆人民争取独立的斗争采取的镇压措施，例如合并村庄、实行宵禁和取缔市场等。他透露，现在在喀麦隆有法国军队六万人，而在正常时期法军人数从不超过二千人。奥森德说，居住在喀麦隆东部的三百五十万居民中，有五万爱国志士被关在集中营里。
    他说，尽管如此，喀麦隆人民的地下斗争正在不断发展。奥森德呼吁世界舆论、一切爱好和平的人们和反对殖民主义的政府——特别是亚非和拉丁美洲各国政府对喀麦隆人民的斗争给予支持。
    奥森德指出，最近美国电台造谣说，喀麦隆人民联盟总书记于姆·尼奥勃已经去世，然后美国驻开罗大使馆就同喀麦隆人民联盟驻开罗办事处进行接触，问他们是否已经有新的人来接替尼奥勃。奥森德宣布尼奥勃仍然健在。他指出，这种造谣的目的在于削弱喀麦隆人民争取独立的意志。他强调说，“在我们的国家里没有什么政治真空。我们不需要他们的主义，也不需要他们的人”。
    奥森德表示，下月份以美国代表为首的联合国调查团到喀麦隆进行视察决不可能有什么用处。他主张派遣一个有亚非国家代表参加的调查团到喀麦隆去，在这个调查团里亚非国家的代表人数同它们在世界大家庭中的重要性成比例。他指出，阿拉伯联盟在上月份举行的一次会议中曾经提出了这个建议。
    奥森德要求联合国使外国军队立即撤离喀麦隆。
    奥森德在评论几内亚新近宣布独立时说，“任何对帝国主义的胜利也就是我们的胜利”。他又说，喀麦隆人民联盟对几内亚的独立感到十分满意。
