Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th. People of various ethnic groups, including Miao, Yi, Hui, and Han, in Qiaojia County, Yunnan Province, are directly smelting ore into steel. Since August, Qiaojia County has built 328 indigenous steel furnaces for direct steelmaking, with 171 already in operation, currently averaging over seven tons of daily output.

Qiaojia County has abundant iron ore reserves, estimated at over 100 million tons, with ore grades generally ranging from 35% to 50%. In August of this year, the Qiaojia County Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to rely on the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach to directly smelt ore into steel. At the time, over one hundred Miao farmers from the Dengzhan Iron Plant in the Fifth District, without technical guidance, studied diligently and experimented eight times, but failed to produce steel. The Party organization at the plant immediately led everyone to summarize their experiences and lessons, discovering that the main reasons for not being able to produce steel were insufficient wind power and a non-dry furnace core. Later, they installed double bellows to increase the wind power, and the molten steel flowed out smoothly. The steel produced could be used to manufacture agricultural tools and steel hooks for steelmaking; the steel hooks they are currently using are made from this steel. Afterwards, the indigenous method of direct steelmaking was promoted throughout the county.

The method of directly smelting iron ore into steel in Qiaojia County is simple and easy to learn. They build furnaces four feet high, three feet long, and about two feet wide in the middle, coating the furnace walls with sticky mud. Then, in the furnace core, they build a furnace bottom the size of a washbasin, about five inches deep. The wind pipe from the bellows curves and turns towards the furnace bottom. A steel outlet is opened next to the furnace. Two people can build such a furnace in one day, and it can be put into production the next day after completion. When smelting steel, a layer of charcoal (or half charcoal and half coke) is placed, followed by a layer of ore. The ore should be roasted and crushed into egg-sized pieces. Each layer of ore is only three inches thick, with a total of six to seven layers, and 30% limestone is added according to the amount of ore. After the indigenous furnace is ignited, the method of "thin feeding, gentle placement, and frequent addition" is adopted, adding about twenty jin of ore each time and raking the slag every fifteen minutes. Each furnace only requires twenty people to operate.

### 巧家县土炼钢炉神通大  矿石直接炼成钢

    巧家县土炼钢炉神通大
    矿石直接炼成钢
    新华社昆明10日电　云南省苗、彝、回、汉民族聚居的巧家县人民，直接用矿石炼出钢来。从8月份以来，巧家县建成直接炼钢的三百二十八座土炼钢炉，有一百七十一座已经投入生产，现在平均日产达到七吨多。
    巧家县铁矿蕴藏丰富，约在一亿吨以上，矿石品位一般是35％到50％。今年8月，中共巧家县委提出要依靠“小、土、群”的办法用矿石直接炼出钢来。当时，第五区灯盏铁厂的一百多个苗族农民在没有技术指导的情况下，苦钻苦学，先后试验八次，但没有炼成。厂里的党组织立即领导大家总结经验教训，发现炼不出钢的主要原因是风力太小和炉心不干。后来他们配上双风箱，加大了风力，钢水就顺利地流出来。炼出的钢能够制造农具和炼钢用的钢钩，他们现在用的钢钩就是用这种钢做的。以后，土法直接炼钢就在全县推广开来。
    巧家县直接用铁矿石炼钢的办法简单易学。他们筑成四尺高、三尺长、中间约二尺来宽的炉子，炉墙周围用粘泥涂好，然后在炉心部筑成面盆大小的炉底，约五寸深。风箱通往炉心的风管弯曲转向炉底。炉子旁边开一个钢水口。这种炉子两个人一天就可以筑成一个，建成的第二天就可以投入生产。炼钢时，放一层木炭（或一半木炭一半焦炭），再放一层矿石，矿石要用经过焙烧的熟矿石，碎成鸡蛋大小。每层矿石只放三寸厚，一共放六至七层，按矿石数量再加入30％的石灰石。土炉红火以后，采取“薄料、轻放、勤上”的方法，每次加矿石二十斤左右，每十五分钟掏沟一次。每个炉子只要二十人操作。
