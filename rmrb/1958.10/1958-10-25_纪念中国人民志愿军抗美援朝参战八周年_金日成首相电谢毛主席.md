    Commemorating the Eighth Anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Kim Il-sung Sends Telegram to Chairman Mao Expressing Gratitude

    Xinhua News Agency, October 24th – On the eve of the eighth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Premier Kim Il-sung sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong. The telegram reads as follows:

    To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

    On the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army's participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I, in the name of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the entire Korean people, extend to you, esteemed Chairman Comrade, and through you to the fraternal Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who aided us with their blood, my warmest greetings and heartfelt gratitude.

    The brave officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, educated by the glorious Communist Party of China, together with our people, repelled the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism, defended the land of our motherland, and made tremendous contributions to the economic recovery and construction of our people after the war.

    Today, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has completed its internationalist mission and returned to the motherland. However, their immortal feats established on the land of our motherland will be passed down through generations among our people and will forever shine brightly alongside our flourishing and developing motherland.

    The Korean people cherish the proletarian internationalist friendship and unity with the fraternal Chinese people as they cherish their own eyes, and will forever advance together with the Chinese people in the cause of opposing imperialist aggressors and defending the eastern outpost of peace and the socialist camp.

    On behalf of the entire Korean people, I sincerely wish the Chinese people new victories in successfully building socialism in China and in the struggle to win security in the Far East and world peace.

                  Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
                                      October 24, 1958, in Pyongyang
