Our mountaineering team recently had thirteen members ascend Shule Mountain, the main peak of the Qilian Mountains in our country, at 6,305 meters above sea level, and conducted glacial research. Seventeen Chinese mountaineering team members, along with twenty-one Soviet mountaineering team members, ascended Lenin Peak, a Soviet peak 7,134 meters high.

Our female athletes Yuan Yang, Jiang Ying, and Zhou Yuying simultaneously ascended a peak of 6,900 meters, setting a new record for Chinese female mountaineering. Before this, only five female athletes in the world had mountaineering records exceeding this height.

The mountaineering team observed the glacial distribution and discovered fourteen large glaciers, covering an area of 80,257 square kilometers, with a water storage capacity of 5.5075 billion cubic meters, equivalent to 68.8 Ming Tombs Reservoirs.

Shule Mountain is located in Qinghai Province and is the most complex, highest, and glacier-filled mountain in the Qilian Mountains, a high mountain where no one had ever set foot before. The mountaineering team set out from Jiuquan, Gansu Province, in early August, crossed five mountains over 5,000 meters above sea level, and advanced towards Shule Mountain.

In the team climbing Lenin Peak, seventeen Chinese mountaineering team members reached the summit, sixteen of whom were novices. Many of the twenty-one members of the Soviet team were experienced meritorious athletes and sports champions. Lenin Peak is located on the famous Pamir Plateau and is the third highest peak in the Soviet Union. The Sino-Soviet climbing team arrived at the "October Glacier" base camp at an altitude of 4,100 meters in mid-August and reached the summit of 7,134 meters on September 7.

The Chinese athletes who participated in these two mountaineering expeditions have now all returned to Beijing. Cai Shufan, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, presented certificates and badges to athletes who achieved the title of grade athletes in this mountaineering campaign on the 9th.

    我国登山运动员的壮举
    征服了六千多公尺的祁连山主峰疏勒山
    同苏联运动员登上七千多公尺的列宁峰
    本报讯　我国登山运动队，最近有十三名队员登上了我国祁连山上的主峰——拔海六千三百零五公尺的疏勒山，并进行了冰川考察工作。有十七名中国登山队员同二十一名苏联登山队员一起登上七千一百三十四公尺的苏联高山列宁峰。
    我国女子运动员袁扬、姜霙、周玉瑛同时登上了六千九百公尺的高峰，开创了我国女子登山的新纪录。在这之前，世界上只有五个女子运动员的登山纪录超过这个高度。
    登山队观测了冰川分布情况，发现了十四条大型冰川，面积八万零二百五十七方公里，储水量达五十五亿零七十五公方，相当于六十八点八个十三陵水库的容量。
    疏勒山在青海境内，是祁连山脉中地势最复杂、最高、冰川最多、过去从没有人迹的高山。这个登山队是8月初从甘肃酒泉出发，翻越了五座拔海五千公尺以上的高山，向疏勒山进军的。
    在攀登列宁峰的一队中，有十七名中国登山队员，登上了顶峰，其中有十六个是新手。苏联队二十一名队员中有不少是富有经验的功勋运动员和运动健将。列宁峰在著名的帕米尔高原上，是苏联境内的第三高峰。中苏爬山队是在8月中到达拔海四千一百公尺高度的“十月冰川”大本营的，9月7日就登上了七千一百三十四公尺的顶峰。
    参加这两次登山运动的我国运动员，现在已经全部回到北京。国家体委副主任蔡树藩9日给在这次登山运动中获得等级运动员称号的颁发了等级运动员的证章、证书。
