Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 13th:

"Thousands of poems and paintings adorn the streets; men, women, old and young sing battle songs."
This is a vivid portrayal of the mass poetry creation movement that has swept the heroic city of Xiamen Island, a frontline of national defense, in the past month. Since the beginning of September, many "ten-thousand-poem schools," factories, streets, and villages have emerged on Xiamen Island. From people in their seventies and Young Pioneers of thirteen to housewives who have just shed their illiteracy, all have picked up their pens to write inspiring verses, vividly depicting the heroic spirit of the military and civilians on the heroic island.
While the American aggressors were carrying out military provocations and war threats in the Taiwan Strait area, tens of thousands of poems denouncing the American aggressors immediately appeared on the streets and in the countryside:
	"Waves surge in the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese people are full of ambition;
	Warning you ambitious aggressors, we have prepared our wolf-slaying knives!"
	"In China's territorial waters, beneath the people's steel net,
	If the enemy dares to provoke, we'll treat them like fish and shrimp."
	"The number of American warships increases, we 'order' more from you;
	Khrushchev put it well, the gunboat policy is over,
	Now the power of rockets is great, enough for target practice.
	If you don't hurry back, be careful you'll meet Yama in the sea."
Angered by the military provocations of American imperialism, the more than 200,000 people of Xiamen Island implemented universal armament. While supporting the People's Liberation Army day and night, they wrote down their own earth-shaking battle songs of universal mobilization. Steel workers wrote:
	"Motors rumble like thunder, sparks fly dazzlingly bright,
	The surging molten steel rushes forth, burning away the American imperialists to safeguard peace."
Farmers wrote:
	"We treat the fields as battlefields, hoes and ploughs are knives and guns,
	Pick up knives and guns to work hard in production, braving the artillery fire to grow more grain,
	Achieve bumper harvests in both production and supporting the front, making the enemy cry for their parents."
As news of the People's Liberation Army's victory in severely punishing the Chiang army continued to pour in, the islanders wrote a large number of poems praising the unprecedented strength and heroic image of the People's Liberation Army. Among them, there are songs praising artillery observers:
	"The eyes of the artillery, better than a thousand-mile eye.
	Looking up through the ninth heaven, looking down and connecting the four seas.
	The artillery sight faces the sky, enemy planes somersault and crash.
	The artillery sight faces the sea, enemy ships emit thick smoke.
	The artillery sight aims at Jinmen, the bunkers collapse entirely.
	Praising the artillery eyes, their contribution is as high as the sky."
There are songs praising naval soldiers:
	"Heroic torpedo boats, truly brave in killing the enemy.
	Chiang's ships with 'Zhong' characters, one wounded, one sunk."
There are songs praising the air force:
	"Heroic silver eagles, majestic in the sky.
	When enemy planes invade, strike them down into the Dragon Palace."
Encouraged by the heroic deeds and victorious news of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of the people are determined to go all out to support the front and step up production. They wrote:
	"The sun rises, radiating red light, the people on the front line are busy with production.
	Compete in supporting the front, compete in output, see who gets on the hero list first."
	"Spur on the horse for a great leap forward, one day equals twenty years.
	The front line's annihilation of the enemy shakes the world, production records soar like rockets."

    千诗万画上街头
    男女老少唱战歌
    英雄厦门岛掀起群众诗歌创作运动
    “千诗万画上街头，男女老少唱战歌”。
    这是祖国海防前哨英雄城市厦门岛上人民一个多月来掀起群众性诗歌创作运动的生动写照。从9月初旬到现在，厦门岛上出现了许多个万首诗歌学校、工厂、街道和乡村。从七十多岁的老人、十三岁的少先队员到刚刚脱掉文盲帽子的家庭妇女全都提笔写出了激动人心的诗句，生动地刻划了英雄岛上军民的英雄面貌。
    正当美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅和战争威胁的时候，成千上万首痛斥美国侵略者的诗歌立即出现在街头和农村：
    “台湾海峡浪滔滔，中国人民志气豪；
    警告野心侵略者，咱们备好杀狼刀！”
    “中国领海中，人民钢网下，
    敌人敢挑衅，把它当鱼虾。”
    “美国军舰再增多，我们向你来‘订货’；
    赫鲁晓夫说得好，炮舰政策时已过，
    如今火箭威力大，供给打靶差不多。
    如不赶快滚回去，当心下海见阎罗。”
    被美帝国主义的军事挑衅激怒了的厦门岛二十多万人民，实行了全民武装。他们一面日夜支援人民解放军，一面写下自己全民总动员的气吞山河的战歌。钢铁工人写道：
    “马达隆隆似雷鸣，火花四溅耀眼明，
    滚滚钢水怒奔处，烧尽美帝保和平。”
    农民写道：
    “我们田地当战场，锄头犁耙是刀枪，
    拿起刀枪勤生产，冒着炮火多打粮，
    生产支前两丰收，要叫敌人喊爹娘。”
    随着英雄的人民解放军严惩蒋军的胜利消息不断传来，岛上人民写作了大批歌颂人民解放军空前强大和英雄形象的诗歌。其中，歌颂炮兵观察兵的有：
    “炮兵的眼睛，胜过千里眼。
    仰望穿九天，俯视通四海。
    炮镜朝天空，敌机倒栽葱。
    炮镜向大海，敌舰冒浓烟。
    炮镜瞄金门，碉堡整个崩。
    歌颂炮兵眼，功劳高如天。”
    歌颂水兵的有：
    “英勇鱼雷艇，杀敌真勇猛。
    蒋舰‘中’字号，一伤一灭顶。”
    歌颂空军的有：
    “英勇银鹰，威镇长空。
    敌机来犯，打入龙宫。”
    在解放军英雄事迹和胜利捷报的鼓舞下，广大人民决心全力支前、加紧生产。他们写道：
    “太阳出来放红光，前沿人民生产忙。
    比支前、赛产量，看谁先上英雄榜。”
    “快马加鞭大跃进，一天等于二十年。
    前哨歼敌英名震，生产纪录坐火箭。”
