Guan Hanqing Would Hardly Recognize His Old Home
Tian Han

On the morning of September 24th, we passed an ancient Wuren Bridge and arrived at Wuren Village. An'guo County in Hebei Province was formerly known as Qizhou. Some research suggests that Guan Hanqing, the great Yuan Dynasty dramatist, was from Wuren Village, Qizhou. According to Deputy County Head Comrade Jiao Jiaju, the An'guo County Gazetteer does indeed have such a record, and there are Guan family graves in Wuren Village. Comrade Song Shengcai, the former township head and current brigade leader, is a farmer who is very familiar with Guan Hanqing. This is truly something that Wang Heqing (Guan Hanqing's friend) would envy. But if Guan Hanqing were truly a local, he would hardly recognize his hometown upon returning, for it has changed so much!

After listening to the commune leader's introduction, we went to Nanloudi Village to see the multi-headed sorghum, large corn, and tall-stalk cotton (mainly Xuzhou No. 209, short-boll, and 353). Then we went to a deep plowing site to visit the farmers. There, in addition to digging the ground with hoes in sections, they were also using tractors, and the songs of men and women filled the fields.

After seeing the high-yield wheat fields and the locomotive boiler well in Zhuotou Village, we returned to Wuren Village. After resting, we went to the commune canteen to eat a free meal, taking our first lesson in communist living.

First, a large plate of locally produced, fat and tender sweet potatoes, like little pigs, was brought up, along with bean buns. Then, stir-fried cabbage with pork, noodle soup, and other dishes were brought out in succession, turning into a lavish feast. Later, we learned that that meal was a combination of two canteens. The canteen had one manager, leading seven female cooks, who were responsible for the meals of 123 households, totaling 572 people. (In She'er Village, seven female cooks were responsible for the meals of 450 people.) But just because there were few cooks, it wasn't just the same old large pot of rice and vegetables. They put forward the slogan of "eating well, with variety, and rich nutrition," and they truly achieved this. Because they were all women, large steaming baskets had to be moved mechanically; large pot lids were divided into two halves for easy opening; the well platform was raised, and well water was channeled into the pot through bamboo pipes, eliminating the need for manual carrying. Vegetable cutting and noodle making were all done with self-made machines. They also used blowers to fan the coal fire, and grain processing no longer used stone mills, but instead motorized steel mills. This is called the three modernizations of the canteen: feminization, mechanization, and water piping.

We were particularly pleased with a system in the commune canteen that was in line with the Chinese people's spirit of hospitality. Relatives and friends of commune members were considered to be everyone's relatives and friends. They were treated well on the first day, and treated as one of their own from the second to the fifth day. Grain coupons were only required after the fifth day. This is truly a reasonable system.

That afternoon, we also saw the fertilizer factory. An'guo County produced as much as 3 billion catties of local fertilizer. We also saw the kindergarten, where the children's lively and innocent songs and dances completely moved us. A plump five-year-old child, beating bamboo clappers and singing "Socialism is good" with great enthusiasm, made everyone so happy that they hugged him tightly.

    关汉卿难认旧家乡
    田汉
    9月24日上午，我们经过一座古老的伍仁桥，到了伍仁村。河北省安国县旧名祁州，有人考证元朝大戏剧家关汉卿，就是祁州伍仁村人。据副县长焦家驹同志说，安国县志确有这样的记载，伍仁村还有关家坟。原乡长现大队长宋盛彩同志系一农民，提起关汉卿他一点也不生疏。这真值得王和卿（关汉卿的朋友）羡妒。但倘使关汉卿真是本地人，他化鹤归来，准认不出家乡了，他的家乡变了样了！
    听过公社社长介绍情况之后我们到南楼底村看多穗高粱，大包谷、高干棉花（主要是徐州二○九号、短果植枝和三五三号）。旋到一个深翻工地，去慰问农民。那儿除分片用锄头挖地之外还使用拖拉机，男女歌声遍野。
    看过卓头村的小麦高产地和锅驼机井之后我们回到伍仁村，休息后到公社食堂吃不要钱的饭，上了共产主义生活的第一课。
    首先端上来的是一大盘当地出产的肥嫩得跟小猪似的甘薯，还有豆包。其后白菜炒肉，面条汤等源源而来，竟是一桌丰盛的筵席。后来才知那顿是两个食堂合并在一起的。食堂有一位管理员，率领着七位女炊事员，管一百二十三户，五百七十二人的伙食。（舍二村，是七个女炊事员管四百五十人的伙食。）但并不因为炊事员少，就是千篇一律的大锅菜饭，他们提出了“吃的好，花样多，营养丰富”的口号，他们也真做到这样。由于都是妇女，大蒸笼得用机械搬运；大锅盖分成两半，以便容易揭开；把井台提高，通过竹管把井水流到锅里，不必用人力去挑。切菜压面都用自造的机器。还用煽风机煽煤火，粮食加工不用石碾，一律改用机动的钢磨。这叫食堂三化：妇女化、机械化、水管化。
    我们尤其欢喜公社食堂的一种符合中国人民好客精神的制度。社员的亲戚朋友被认为是大家的亲戚朋友，第一天吃得好些，第二天到第五天当自己人看待。第五天以后才要粮票。这真是合情合理的制度。
    那天午后我们还看了化肥厂，安国全县制造的土化肥就达三十亿斤。又看了幼儿园，幼儿们活泼天真的歌舞完全感动了我们。一个五岁的小胖孩子，手打竹板，神气十足地唱“社会主义好”，更使大家欢喜得把他紧紧地抱起来。
