Good yields for a day are good; even better are high yields every day.
Xinhua County's daily pig iron production stabilizes at 1,500 tons for seventeen days.

(Our report) From September 29th to October 15th, pig iron production in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, remained stable at 1,500 tons per day for seventeen days. On September 29th and October 10th, the daily pig iron production even rose to 2,000 tons. Of the 2,400 furnaces put into production in the county, 88% are able to produce iron normally. Now, the people of the county are fighting day and night to seize even higher yields of pig iron.

After Xinhua County's daily pig iron production reached 2,000 tons at the end of September, it continued to strengthen political and ideological leadership and constantly overcome ideological obstacles. At that time, two situations emerged in the thinking of some cadres and the masses: one was that they were satisfied with the victories already achieved and were unwilling to go down into the kilns or to the furnaces, and their work style became superficial; the other was that they believed that the potential of the native furnaces had reached its "peak" and could not be improved any further. The Xinhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly convened a meeting of cadres to carry out a rectification campaign centered on planting red flags and pulling out white flags, commended 193 outstanding cadres who worked hard and studied hard, were able to quickly master technology, and created high-yield records, and criticized some cadres who were unwilling to work hard and go deep into production, and whose work style was superficial. This unified thinking and boosted morale. Everyone was determined to continue fighting for greater victories in iron smelting.

In order to strive for higher output, Xinhua County further improved furnace types and built new furnaces based on the original native furnaces. The furnaces built in Xinhua County in the past had low output, generally ranging from a few hundred catties to one thousand catties per day for zheng furnaces and about one ton for water-releasing furnaces. Therefore, in addition to continuing to ensure the normal production of the original furnaces, the county built 2,200 new native blast furnaces with a daily output of two tons, three tons, and five tons.

The county opened small coal mines and mined ore on a large scale, and vigorously promoted the use of white coal and coal briquettes for iron smelting to ensure that each native furnace had sufficient reserves of fuel and ore. The County Party Committee put forward the action slogan of "the whole people mine coal, the whole people mine ore, so that the furnaces can eat their fill and eat well." The number of coal mining laborers increased from more than 23,000 at the end of September to more than 90,000. The number of coal mines expanded from more than 500 to 806. The daily output of coal has reached more than 12,000 tons. The number of mines has increased from 843 to more than 930, and the daily output has increased to 3,500 tons. While comprehensively increasing the production of fuel and mineral sand, the County Party Committee also adopted the method of "focusing on key points, regional collaboration, and mutual support," and according to the imbalance in resource distribution, such as 23 townships with more iron and less coal, and 4 townships with less iron and more coal, 12 areas rich in coal and iron were the main force, and 12 collaboration zones were established to establish joint coal mining, ore mining, and smelting enterprises, and other areas without coal or iron provided labor support. This not only met the current production needs, but also by the beginning of October, it had stored more than 52,000 tons of coal, more than 4,600 tons of coking coal, and more than 40,000 tons of mineral sand.

The people learning technology and continuously improving technology is an important condition for maintaining the normal production of furnaces. In breaking through the technical barrier, Xinhua County focused on the following links: vigorously training furnace masters, the county adopted methods such as running training classes, master apprenticeships, and on-site visits and internships to train more than 5,500 furnace masters, basically ensuring that every furnace had a master. Vigorously grabbing the production of blowers, establishing a blower manufacturing plant, and mobilizing the masses to contribute materials to manufacture blowers. Innovate native furnace operating technology and carry out ten reforms: the furnace type is changed from small to large, from short to tall; the open flame at the top of the furnace is changed to non-flaming; materials are proportioned and added on time; coal and ore are carefully selected to remove impurities; the size and length of the air pipes are unified; 10% limestone is added to every hundred catties of ore; the number of drafts is fixed, 16-20 times per minute, and the length is pulled to 80% of the bellows rod; a shift handover system is established; the furnace is released after approval; and a production responsibility system is implemented for each native furnace.

Xinhua County also implemented factory-style management of iron factories, and gradually brought production management work onto a regular track. The county's 62 townships with coal and iron were organized into 18 joint coal and iron enterprises. Each factory and mine established work plans, and all plans were announced to the workers at the beginning of the month, and production was checked monthly, ten-day periods, and daily. In this way, the workers had a clear understanding of the production plan, and their production enthusiasm was high. In addition, practical and feasible systems have been established for production, mining, transportation, finance, etc. This has greatly promoted the development of production. The labor attendance rate of the county's iron smelting workers has increased by 23% compared with the original, and the production cost has been reduced by 15%.

In the iron smelting movement, leaders at all levels went deep into production, deep into the masses, and according to the production development situation in each period, adopted methods such as focusing on key points, using points to lead the way, holding on-site meetings, and summarizing and promoting advanced experience to guide production. More than 80% of the county's cadres have established experimental furnaces, and 292 of them have become "all-rounders" in iron smelting.

While strengthening production leadership, the County Party Committee also paid special attention to the lives of workers, adjusted the supply of grain and edible oil, and mobilized the communes to send live pigs and vegetables to coal and iron workers. The commune party committees also tried their best to solve the problem of workers lacking straw sandals, bowls, and chopsticks. The iron factories also took many cold and rain protection measures to ensure that the workers lived and slept well.

    一天高产好  天天高产更好
    新化县十七天来日产生铁稳定在一千五百吨水平
    本报讯　湖南省新化县从9月29日到10月15日的十七天中，生铁日产量一直稳定在一千五百吨的水平。9月29日和10月10日两天，生铁日产量还上升到二千吨。全县已经投入生产的二千四百座炉子有88％的能够正常出铁。现在，全县人民正在为夺取生铁的更高产量而日夜奋战。
    新化县从9月底生铁日产量达到二千吨以后，继续加强政治思想领导，不断克服思想障碍。当时，部分干部和群众的思想上出现了两种情况，一种是满足于已经取得的胜利，不愿下窑井、到炉边，作风飘浮起来；另一种是认为土炉的潜力已经“到了顶”不能再跃进了。中共新化县委及时召开了干部会议，开展以插红旗拔白旗为中心的战地整风，表扬了一百九十三个苦战苦学、能够迅速掌握技术、创造了高产纪录的优秀干部，批判了一些不愿艰苦深入，作风飘浮的干部。这样就统一了思想，振奋了士气。大家决心为争取炼铁更大的胜利而继续战斗。
    为了争取更高的产量，新化县在依靠原有土炉的基础上，进一步改进炉型，增建新炉。新化县过去所建的炉子产量低，一般都是日产几百斤到一千斤的甑炉和一吨左右的放水炉。因此，除了继续搞好原有炉子的正常生产外，全县新建了日产二吨、三吨和五吨的土高炉二千二百座。
    全县大开小煤窑，大挖矿石，大力推广白煤和煤球炼铁，以保证每座土炉的燃料和矿石有充足的储备量。县委提出了“全民挖煤、全民开矿、让炉吃饱吃好”的行动口号。采煤劳动力由9月底的两万三千多人增加到九万多人。煤井由五百多个扩大到八百零六个。煤的日产量已达到一万二千多吨。矿井由八百四十三处增加到九百三十多处，日产量增加到三千五百吨。在全面增产燃料矿砂的同时，县委还采取了“突击重点、分区协作、互相支援”的办法，根据二十三个乡铁多煤少、四个乡铁少煤多等资源分布不平衡的情况，以十二个煤铁丰富的地区为主，成立十二个协作区，建立采煤挖矿石冶炼联合企业，其他无煤无铁的地区支援劳力。这样不仅满足了目前生产需要，而且到10月上旬止，储备了煤炭五万二千多吨、焦煤四千六百多吨、矿砂四万多吨。
    全民学技术，不断改进技术提高技术，是保持炉子正常生产的重要条件。新化县在突破技术关方面，着重抓住了以下几个环节：大力培训炉师，全县采取办训练班、师傅带徒弟、现场参观实习等办法，先后训练了炉师五千五百多人，基本上做到了炉炉有师傅。大抓鼓风机，建立一个鼓风机制造厂，并动员群众献料，制造鼓风机。革新土炉操作技术，进行十改：炉型由小改大，由矮改高；变炉顶明火焰为不吐火焰；按比例配料，定时上料；精选煤炭矿石，除尽杂质；风管的大小长短统一规格；每百斤矿石加石灰石10％；扯风定数，一分钟扯16—20次，长度扯到风箱杆的80％；建立交接班制度；放炉经批准；每座土炉实行了生产责任制。
    新化县还实行铁厂管理工厂化，把生产管理工作逐步引向正规。全县六十二个有煤铁的乡，组成为十八个煤铁联合企业。各厂矿都建立了作业计划，各项计划月初都向职工宣布，按月、按旬、按日检查生产。这样职工们对生产计划个个心中有数，生产情绪很高。此外，对生产、采矿、运输、财务等，都建立了切实可行的制度。这就大大促进了生产的发展。全县炼铁职工劳动出勤率比原来提高了23％，生产成本降低了15％。
    在炼铁运动中，各级领导干部，深入生产，深入群众，并根据各个时期生产发展的情况，采取抓重点，以点带面，召开现场会，总结推广先进经验等办法来指导生产。全县有80％以上的干部都建立了试验炉，其中有二百九十二人成了炼铁的“多面手”。
    县委在加强生产领导的同时，还特别关心职工生活，调整了粮食和食油的供应量，发动各公社送生猪和蔬菜给煤铁职工。工人们缺少草鞋、碗筷，各公社党委也尽量设法解决。各铁厂也采取了许多防寒防雨措施，保证了职工住好睡好。
