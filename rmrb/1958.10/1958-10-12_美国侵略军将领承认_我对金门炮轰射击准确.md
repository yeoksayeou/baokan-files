Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Taipei news: Brigadier General Burke, head of the U.S. military "aid" advisory group's army section stationed in Taiwan, admitted at a press conference on the 8th that our army's artillery fire in the recent bombardment of Jinmen "aimed very accurately" at specific military targets. He said that the artillery fire was quite accurate at the landing beach area, but areas without military targets were not bombarded. Therefore, he believes that this shelling "did not excessively bother the civilians." Burke took advantage of the temporary cessation of our military's shelling to hurriedly go to Jinmen Island on the 8th with a group of military experts and technicians for a "visit". He held a press conference after returning to Taipei.

In his speech, this American general bluntly stated that any action taken by the United States towards the Chiang Kai-shek Group is primarily for the benefit of the United States. He said, "We will not do anything for China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek Group) that does not benefit the United States." In addition to boasting at the press conference that the morale of the Kuomintang army, who were terrified by the shells, was still "very good," he also had to admit the power of the People's Liberation Army's shelling. He said that many cannons and landing craft were destroyed in the shelling, and many of them were "beyond repair." However, in order to conceal the heavy losses of the Chiang army on Jinmen Island, Burke emphasized to reporters that the destroyed Kuomintang vehicles or ships would not fill the beaches, except in a very few cases when there was a slight "confusion" between the military branches.

Burke admitted that the amphibious landing operations on Jinmen Island were carried out under the guidance of the "U.S. Marine Corps."

Burke also revealed that in August, before our army's shelling of Jinmen, he and his staff had also "visited" the islands and made "about ninety suggestions" to the Kuomintang military to improve the "defense" of the islands.

### 美国侵略军将领承认  我对金门炮轰射击准确

    美国侵略军将领承认
    我对金门炮轰射击准确
    新华社11日讯　台北消息：美国驻台湾军事“援助”顾问团陆军组组长博尔克准将8日在记者招待会上承认：我军这次轰击金门的炮火对具体的军事目标“瞄得非常准确”。他说，炮火对登陆滩头地区打得相当准，但没有军事目标的地方都没有遭到炮轰。因此他认为这次炮击“并没有使平民感到过分烦恼”。博尔克是趁我军暂停炮击的时机带着一批军事专家和技术人员在8日匆匆到金门岛去“访问”的。他在回到台北后举行了一次记者招待会。
    这位美国将军在谈话中直言不讳地说：美国对蒋介石集团所采取的任何行动都是为了首先使美国受益。他说，“凡不能使美国受益的事情，我们就不替中国（按指蒋介石集团）做。”他在记者招待会上除了吹嘘被炮弹打得惊魂失魄的国民党军队的士气仍然“非常好”之外，也不得不承认人民解放军炮击的威力。他说，在炮击中很多的大炮和登陆用的船只被击毁了。而且其中很多已“无法再修理”。但为了掩盖金门岛上蒋军的惨重损失，博尔克又对记者强调，被击毁的国民党的车辆或船只并不会塞满海滩，除非在极少数情况下各军种之间稍为有点“乱”的时候。
    博尔克承认，金门岛上的两栖登陆行动都是在“美国陆战队”的指导下进行的。
    博尔克还透露，8月间，在这次我军炮轰金门之前他和他的人员也曾“访问”过这个岛群，他们向国民党军方提出了“大约九十条建议”，来改善这个岛群的“防御”。
