    Organic Silicone as Insulation Material
    Motors Made with It are Small, Efficient, Use Less Material, and Have a Long Lifespan

    Xinhua News Agency, 19th. China's first organic silicone insulated motor has been successfully trial-produced in the Electrical Engineering Department of Northeast Institute of Technology. After use, it runs normally. This motor has the same body as an ordinary 7-kilowatt squirrel-cage motor, but its power output is about twice as high.
    Electric motors made with organic silicone paint as insulation material are reduced in volume and weight by 40% compared to motors with the same power output, and the service life can be extended tenfold. If this insulation material is widely used in China's motor industry, it can save the country hundreds of thousands of tons of copper, silicon steel, and carbon steel annually. This high-temperature resistant organic silicone insulating varnish is a new product that China recently successfully trial-produced. It is the best insulating material for motors. It has excellent properties such as temperature resistance, insulation, moisture resistance, and high strength. Motors made with it can be used safely at high temperatures or in extremely humid conditions, making it very suitable for rural field drainage and irrigation or places with poor temperature and humidity protection equipment. Organic silicone insulating varnish has already been put into production in China, and its raw materials are very abundant.

    有机硅做绝缘材料
    制成电动机，体积小，效率高，用料少，寿命长
    新华社19日讯　我国第一台有机硅绝缘电动机，已在东北工学院电力系试制成功。经过使用，运转正常。这台电机体质和普通七瓩鼠笼式电动机相同，但发电输出功率比它提高了一倍左右。
    用有机硅漆做绝缘材料制成的电动机，体积与重量比发电量相同的电动机相应缩减了40％，使用寿命可延长十倍。如果我国电机工业普遍采用这种绝缘材料，一年可为国家节约铜、硅钢、炭素钢数十万吨。这种能耐高温的有机硅绝缘漆是我国不久前试制成功的新产品，是做电机最好的绝缘材料，它有耐温、绝缘、防潮、强度高等优异性能，制出的电机可在高温或空气极湿的条件下安全使用，因而很适合农村田野排水灌溉或防温防湿设备不良的地方使用。有机硅绝缘漆在我国已投入生产，其原料来源是很丰富的。
