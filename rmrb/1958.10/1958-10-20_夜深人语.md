　　Late at night, all is quiet. Liu Husheng, the captain of the East Wind Cultivation Zone, and Li Jingbo, the accountant, one reciting and the other calculating with an abacus, were figuring out the total area of autumn miscellaneous crops in the entire cultivation zone. Liu Husheng said, "The area is quite large, but what we lack is labor." Li Jingbo yawned and said, "What are we afraid of? In the future, when we have tractors, we can plow the whole area in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said..."

　　Suddenly, the phone rang. Li Jingbo grabbed the receiver:

　　"Yes... What? Support 'Marshal'? Uh-huh, understood!"

　　It turned out that the commune management committee was calling, asking them to select twenty-five strong young men to rush to the railway station overnight to move coal and coke.

　　Liu Husheng pushed himself up from the table and said, "I'll go notify them. When they arrive, you take them first."

　　Li Jingbo glanced at Liu Husheng's right leg (this leg had been cut open by a plow blade two days ago, leaving a two-inch wide wound, which was still bandaged and made walking difficult), and said:

　　"I'll go, your leg..."

　　"Can't worry about that." Liu Husheng had already pushed open the door and disappeared quickly into the darkness, hobbling along.

　　Before it took the time to eat a meal, men, women, old and young packed the accounting office full. Li Jingbo got anxious, lit a gasoline lamp and hung it at the door, put the whistle in his mouth and blew a long blast:

　　"Those going to the railway station to transport coal and coke, gather here, the rest go back to sleep."

　　"What nonsense! In the middle of the night, if we weren't going to transport coal and coke, why would we come here to relax?"

　　Li Jingbo followed the voice and found it was Lan Man from Shangyou Village.

　　"Ah, why did you come too?"

　　"Why can't I come? Why did Uncle Gui Er also come? I'm only fifty-something, he's seventy!" Lan Man grumbled discontentedly.

　　Li Jingbo looked to his right and, sure enough, Uncle Gui Er was staring at him and smiling with his toothless mouth.

　　"Hey, Uncle Gui Er! Are you young?"

　　"Why not young? Doesn't the song say that in our society, the older people get, the younger they become?" Uncle Gui Er said with a grin, deliberately teasing Li Jingbo.

　　Li Jingbo was even more anxious and complained, "Sigh, how did Captain Liu notify you? He wanted young and strong people!"

　　"The captain did say he wanted young people. But moving coal also has to be divided by age, there's no such rule!" An old man with a stubbly beard replied, indignantly sticking his short tobacco pipe into his apron.

　　"This won't do!" Li Jingbo blew his whistle several times anxiously and shouted, "Everyone stop chattering, let me choose, whoever is chosen will go!"

　　"Choose?" Uncle Gui Er objected: "Everyone came voluntarily, what's there to choose!"

　　"If you don't let someone go, they won't be happy!"

　　Li Jingbo widened his eyes, at his wit's end. The commune committee said they only needed twenty-five young and strong people, but now one or two hundred have come, including some elderly, women, and children, how can this work!

　　"Uncle Gui Er!" Beads of sweat appeared on Li Jingbo's nose, and he pleaded, "Please take the lead and go back, moving coal and coke is not easy work."

　　"Forget it, this old man is supporting the steel industry and has as much energy as young men, no need for you to worry! Want me to take the lead, I won't do it."

　　"Humph, then there's no organizational discipline? Lenin said..."

　　"Comrade Accountant, can you stop being so long-winded? Let's go now that people are here!" someone shouted.

　　At this moment, Liu Husheng came running back, panting.

　　"What's the matter?" He glanced at everyone, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and complained, "Li Jingbo, so many people have arrived, why haven't you sent them off yet? It's almost dawn!"

　　"Captain!" Li Jingbo breathed a sigh of relief and said, "There are so many people, men, women, old and young, what do we do?"

　　"Haha, a clever person can be stumped by urine," Liu Husheng said, "Take them all!"

　　"The commune committee's phone call clearly said only twenty-five young and strong people, I heard it clearly..."

　　"They want less, more people want to go, wouldn't it be great to add a few extra? Really!"

　　"That's right, the Captain understands what we want!"

　　"People like Brother Husheng are worthy of serving the masses."

　　Everyone discussed, saying one thing or another, and in between speaking, they had already formed a column, singing songs under the leadership of Liu Husheng, and heading towards the station in a mighty fashion.

　　Li Jingbo looked around, saw that everyone had left, then locked the door and chased after them.

    夜深人语
    徐伯青
    深更夜静。东风耕作区大队长刘祜生，会计李静波，一个嘴巴念，一个打算盘，算计着全耕作区的秋杂作物面积。刘祜生说：“面积倒是不少，欠缺的就是劳力。”李静波打了一个哈欠，说：“怕甚么，将来有了拖拉机，一杯茶功夫就能翻个遍，刘少奇同志说……”
    突然电话铃响了，李静波抓起耳机：
    “是呀，……甚么？支援‘元帅’？嗯嗯，听清楚了！”
    原来是社管委会打来电话，叫这里挑二十五个身强力壮的小伙子，连夜赶到火车站，去搬煤焦。
    刘祜生两手一撑，从桌边站起来，说：“我去通知。等人来了，你先带走。”
    李静波朝刘祜生的右腿瞅了一眼（这条腿，在两天前被犁头划破了一条两寸宽的口子，现在还敷了药，走路还很不方便），说道：
    “我去，你的腿……”
    “顾不得那样多。”刘祜生早已推开门，一扭一拐地但是飞快地消失在黑夜里了。
    不到一顿饭功夫，男女老少把个会计室塞得满满的。李静波急了，开燃一盏汽灯，挂到门口，把哨子塞到口里，吹了一长声：
    “到火车站运煤焦的，到这里来集合，其余的都回去睡觉。”
    “真废话！深更半夜的，不是去运煤焦，跑到这来图轻松呀？”
    李静波顺着这个话音找去，原来是上游村的蓝满。
    “啊呀，您怎么也来了呀？”
    “我去不得怎么的？为什么桂二爹也来了？我才五十挂零，他七十岁了！”蓝满不满意地咕噜着。
    李静波朝右一望，可不，桂二爹正张着没牙的嘴，瞅着他笑哩。
    “嗨呀，桂二爹！你年青吗？ ”
    “怎么不年青？不是有个歌子唱道，在咱们这社会里，老年人越活越年青吗？”桂二爹笑嘻嘻地故意逗着李静波。
    李静波更着急了，埋怨道：“唉，晓得刘大队长是怎么通知的？要年青力壮的嘛！”
    “大队长倒是通知了要年青的。可搬搬煤炭也要分个年纪，没这种道理！”有一位胡子楂满脸的老头回答着，气愤愤地把短旱烟杆插在围腰上。
    “这怎么行！”李静波??地吹了几声哨子，叫道：“大家不要乱喳喳，让我来挑，挑得谁个就谁个去！” 
    “挑？”桂二爹反对了：“都是自愿来的嘛，有甚么挑不挑！”
    “不叫谁去，谁也不依从！”
    李静波瞪大了眼，没办法了。社委会说明只要二十五个年青力壮的，如今来了一两百，其中有一些老年、妇女、小孩，这怎么行啊！
    “桂二爹！”李静波鼻梁上渗出一粒粒的大汗珠，央求道：“你老人家起个带头作用吧，先回去，搬煤焦可不是轻松活。”
    “算了吧，我老头支援钢铁，和小伙子一样有劲，犯不着你操心！要我带这个头，我才不得干。”
    “哼，那就没有个组织纪律啦？列宁说……”
    “会计同志，你少罗嗦几句好不好？人到了就走吧！”有人吼起来。
    这时候，刘祜生跑得气呼呼地回来了。
    “甚么事”他扫了大家一眼，揩揩额上的汗，埋怨道：“李静波，人到了这样多，你怎么还不打发走呀？天都快亮了！”
    “大队长！”李静波松了一口气，说：“这样多人，大男小女的，看怎么办？”
    “哈哈，聪明人被尿憋死了，”刘祜生说：“都带上走嘛！”
    “社委会电话说只要二十五个年青力壮的，我听得清清楚楚……”
    “要的少，愿去的多，我们加几个番还不好吗？真是！”
    “是啊，还是大队长懂得我们的心事！”
    “祜生哥这样的人，才配为群众办事。”
    大家你一言我一语，纷纷议论着，说话之间，已经摆成了一路纵队，在刘祜生的带领下，唱着歌，浩浩荡荡地朝车站出发了。
    李静波左顾右盼的看了看，见人都走尽了，才锁上门，追了上去。
