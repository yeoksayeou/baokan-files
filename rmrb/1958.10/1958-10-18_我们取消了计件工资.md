    We Abolished Piece-Rate Wages
    Lü Hongzhi, Wuhan Machine Tool Plant
    Our plant began implementing piece-rate wages in August 1956. Over the past two years, it played a certain role in developing production and increasing labor productivity. However, with the development of production and the improvement of workers' ideological awareness, its weaknesses have become increasingly apparent. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, practice has further proved that piece-rate wages have many problems. During the "Double-Anti" movement, the masses posted 260 big-character posters criticizing piece-rate wages (accounting for 49.1% of the total big-character posters expressing opinions on labor and wages), demanding the abolition of piece-rate wages. After mass debates and listening to the opinions of veteran workers, the Party Committee finally decided, after discussion, to abolish piece-rate wages from June and implement a new reward system, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and a new atmosphere emerged in production.

            Piece-Rate Wages: Full of Contradictions
    Since the implementation of piece-rate wages, the following problems have occurred:
    1. Piece-rate wages promoted the development of economism tendencies among workers and generated many unhealthy trends, which sharply contradicted the principle of putting politics in command: for example, some piece-rate workers often haggled over the allocation of tasks in order to earn more money, and bad tendencies such as "three grabs" and "five no's" emerged among the workers. The "three grabs" meant grabbing good machine tools, grabbing profitable work, and grabbing jobs with large batches and easy work; the so-called "five no's" meant: no doing work with tight quotas, no doing small batches, no doing high-precision work, no doing new products, and no doing rework. Some engaged in fraud, over-reporting downtime, and some scolded the quota-setters for setting tight quotas; more seriously, they regarded socialist competition activities as an extra burden. Some workers openly proposed striving for the "four big items" (watch, bicycle, radio, woolen clothes). One worker had six pairs of woolen trousers and still said that he could not buy the woolen trousers he wanted in department stores.
    2. Piece-rate wages deepened internal contradictions and affected internal unity: between leaders and the masses, tasks could not be assigned, and labor was difficult to arrange. Each time tasks were allocated, the foreman and director had to mobilize and persuade with great effort. Workers only wanted to do piece-rate work, and if they could not work on new machine tools, they would be passive or even simply refuse to work. One worker was assigned to do time-rate work but refused, stopping work for as long as a week. Some workers also reflected that "rich processing, empty welding", "workers get the sweets, staff get the bitterness", "piece-rate is a good life, time-rate is a hard life." In the first quarter of this year, the average monthly wage of time-rate workers in the whole plant was 54 yuan, while that of piece-rate workers was 77.9 yuan, a difference of 44.25%. The highest piece-rate wage was 151.5 yuan, 46% higher than that of time-rate workers of the same grade. Therefore, time-rate workers satirized piece-rate workers, saying, "Our tasks are heavily pressed, and your wages are heavily taken," and "We are for socialism, and you are for individualism." In addition, because of the huge disparity in wages, many disputes arose among family members, and time-rate workers were often scolded by their spouses for being useless, affecting their production morale.
    3. Piece-rate wages do not conform to the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results": this is because some piece-rate workers only pursue quantity and speed, regardless of quality and economy, pursuing output and neglecting quality. For example, the planned target for the scrap rate of mechanical processing in the first quarter was 1.8%, but the actual rate was 3%, and some even reached more than 10%, or even complete scrapping. Among some piece-rate workers, the bias of "the output is mine, and the quality is yours (referring to the enterprise)" prevailed. Piece-rate workers pursuing output not only caused low quality and more scrap, but also caused damage and waste of machine tools and burnout of motor switches because they ignored the load capacity of machine tools and accelerated the speed of machine tools. On the other hand, some piece-rate workers did not dare to go all out for fear of exceeding the quota too much, fearing that others would gossip about taking too much.
    In short, judging from the situation in our factory, piece-rate wages are not conducive to mobilizing all positive factors, organizing and mobilizing the masses, and developing production at high speed. It is understandable that this system was resolutely opposed by the masses in the rectification movement.

            The Masses Consciously Exposed Contradictions
    As early as the first session of the first Workers' Representative Congress last year, the masses raised many opinions on piece-rate wages. After the rectification, the masses had more opinions on piece-rate wages. During the "Double-Anti" movement, the masses posted 260 big-character posters, exposing how piece-rate wages were not adapted to the requirements of the Great Leap Forward, which aroused the great attention of the leadership. In order to handle this issue carefully, the masses were first organized to hold discussions in the No. 1 machining workshop, where the piece-rate area was the largest. At the same time, the Party Committee held a series of meetings, first within the Party and then outside the Party, first the leaders and then the masses, to mobilize the masses at all levels and carry out debates. At the Party Committee Enlarged Meeting, the factory director put forward opinions on the handling of piece-rate wages based on the opinions of the masses, in order to unify thinking and correct understanding; on this basis, a plant-wide Workers' Representative Congress was held, and after discussion, with the exception of a few people who did not understand, it was unanimously agreed that piece-rate wages had many problems and should be abolished. This created favorable conditions for organizing all employees to speak out freely and conduct large-scale debates.
    In more than ten large-scale debates, a small number of piece-rate workers believed that piece-rate wages had their advantages, rewarding more labor with more pay, which conformed to the principle of distribution according to work. After group discussions, big-character posters, and individual help, as well as direct confrontations between time-rate and piece-rate workers, some workers said: "Now is the period of the Great Leap Forward. If others double their efforts, they will double their output. If we piece-rate workers double our efforts, we will get double the money, which is unreasonable"; "Leaders should mobilize the masses politically, not stimulate the workers economically"; "In the past, I would look for tricks and make rationalization proposals, but now I don't care about that at all, and I just work hard regardless of whether the machine tool can handle it." After debates and the personal experiences of piece-rate workers, the ideological awareness of the masses was greatly improved, and the demands of the workers for the abolition of piece-rate wages became more and more urgent. Therefore, the Party Committee and the administrative side jointly decided to abolish the piece-rate wage system and establish a new reward system accordingly.

    A New Atmosphere Appeared After the Abolition of Piece-Rate Wages
    The socialist system plus communist ideology is a characteristic of our country's real life. After the abolition of piece-rate wages, the workers of our plant showed a new atmosphere in production, creating miracles that had never been seen in the piece-rate period. The total output value and labor productivity have increased, the scrap rate has decreased, and accidents have been reduced. For example, the grinder production in May only completed 70.1% of the plan. After the piece-rate was abolished in June, it completed 117.9% of the plan; the scrap rate in May was 3.8%, and in June it dropped to 0.78%. With the abolition of piece-rate wages, the internal unity of the working class was enhanced, and the spirit of mutual support and cooperation was greatly strengthened. For example, the assembly workshop had a plan of ninety-five units in June, which was about to be unfulfilled. In the past, it would have been difficult to mobilize people, but after the abolition of piece-rate wages, it quickly received support from other workshops, and as a result, it completed the task with seventeen units over the plan. Another example is a fitter group. In the past, the work done by piece-rate workers could not be completed on time. Now, they exceed the quota every month. For example, they completed 138% in June, 132.4% in July, and 141% in August.
    It is particularly worth mentioning the battle task of over-fulfilling the ball mill in August. The original plan was thirty units, striving for fifty units. Later, seeing the high enthusiasm of the masses, it was increased to seventy units, striving for eighty-five units. Finally, the Party Committee conveyed the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee and put forward the battle call to fight hard for a week and strive for over-fulfillment. The workers were full of enthusiasm and organized to participate in the shock team in a fighting attitude. Some workers who originally received piece-rate wages continued to fight for 24 hours without leaving the front line. Finally, they completed the task with fifteen units over the plan. This situation had never happened in history. Of course, these achievements are multifaceted, but the main point is that politics is in command, the red flag is planted in the ideology, the piece-rate wage is abolished, and the obstacles on the road to advancement are removed, paving the way for the Great Leap Forward in production.
    At present, the workers of our factory are striding forward with a majestic pace, using the communist attitude towards labor, and leaping forward on the road to greater victory.

    我们取消了计件工资
    武汉机床厂　吕鸿志
    我厂是1956年8月开始实行计件工资的。两年来，对于发展生产，提高劳动生产率曾起过一定的作用。但是，随着生产的发展和工人思想觉悟的提高，日益暴露出它的弱点，特别是生产大跃进以来，从实践中更加证明了计件工资问题很多。在双反运动中，群众对计件工资贴出了二百六十张大字报（占对劳动工资方面意见的大字报总数的49.1％），要求取消计件工资。经过群众辩论和听取老工人的意见，最后经过党委讨论决定，从6月份起取消计件工资，实行了新的奖励制度，大大地发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，在生产上出现了一片新气象。
            计件工资矛盾重重
    实行计件工资以后，发生了以下一些问题：
    一、计件工资促使了工人经济主义思想倾向的发展，产生了许多歪风邪气，与政治挂帅尖锐地矛盾着：如部分计件工人为了多拿钱，在分配任务时，经常讨价还价，工人中产生了“三抢”“五不做”的不良倾向。即抢好机床、抢有油水的活，抢批量大、容易做的活；所谓“五不做”，即：定额紧不做，批量小不做，精度高不做，新产品不做，退修活不做。有的弄虚作假，多报间断工时，有的嫌定额紧，大骂定额员；更严重的是把社会主义竞赛活动看成是额外负担。有的工人公开提出为四大件奋斗（手表、自行车、收音机、呢衣服）。有个工人有六条呢裤子，还说百货公司买不到他所要买的呢裤子。
    二、计件工资加深了内部矛盾，影响了内部团结：表现在领导和群众之间，是任务派不下去，劳动力不好安排，每次分配任务，必须经过工长和主任左动员，右说服，费尽九牛二虎之力，工人只愿作计件活，做新机床，达不到目的，就消极怠工，甚至干脆不干，有个工人分配作计时活，不愿干，停工达一星期之久。也有些工人反映说：“富加工，空冷焊”，“工人吃甜头，职员吃苦头”，“计件是好命，计时是苦命”。今年第一季度全厂计时工人月平均工资是五十四元，而计件工人则为七十七点九元，相差44.25％，计件最高的竟拿到一百五十一点五元，高出同级计时工人的46％，因而计时工人讽刺计件工人说：“我们的任务卯起来压，你们的工资就卯起来拿”，“我们是为社会主义，你们是为个人主义”，此外由于工资收入悬殊，在家属中也产生了许多纠纷，计时工人常被爱人骂没有用，影响生产情绪。三、计件工资不符合党的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线：这是由于有的计件工人只求多快，不顾好省，赶产量，忽视质量，如第一季度机械加工废品率计划指标是1.8％，实际是3％，有的竟高达10％以上，甚至完全报废。在部分计件工人中流行着“产量是我的，质量是你的（指企业）”的偏向，计件工人赶产量不仅造成质量低，废品多，而且因为不顾机床负荷能力，加快机床速度，造成机器工具的损耗浪费、烧坏马达开关的现象，也是非常严重的。另一方面，有些计件工人由于怕超额过多，却不敢鼓足干劲，怕拿多了别人说闲话。
    总之，从我厂的情况看，计件工资对调动一切积极因素、组织发动群众、高速度地发展生产都是不利的。这种制度在整风运动中遭到群众的坚决反对，也是可以理解的。
            群众自觉地揭露矛盾
    早在去年第一届第一次职工代表大会的时候，群众对计件工资就提出许多意见，经过整风，群众对计件工资的意见更多。双反运动中群众贴出了二百六十张大字报，揭露了计件工资如何不适应大跃进的形势要求，引起了领导的高度重视。为了慎重处理这个问题，便先在计件面最大的一加工车间组织群众座谈，同时，厂党委召开了一系列的会议，先党内、后党外，先领导、后群众，层层发动群众，开展辩论。在党委扩大会议上，厂长根据群众意见提出了对计件工资的处理意见，以统一思想，端正认识；在此基础上，又召开全厂职工代表大会，经过讨论，除了个别的人思想不通以外，一致认为计件工资毛病很大，应该取消。这就为组织全体职工大鸣大放、大辩论，创造了有利条件。
    在十多次的大辩论中少部分计件工人认为计件工资有它的优越性，多劳多得，符合按劳付酬。经过小组座谈、大字报鸣放和个别帮助以及计时和计件工人的直接交锋，有的工人说：“现在是大跃进时期，别人翻一番就是一翻，而我们计件工人翻一番，就多拿一番的钱，这是不合理的”；“领导应从政治上来动员群众，而不应该从经济上来刺激工人”；“以前我还找窍门，提合理化建议，现在根本不管那一套，不管机床是否吃得消就卯起来干”。经过辩论和计件工人的现身说法，群众的思想觉悟大大提高了，职工对取消计件工资的要求也愈来愈迫切了。于是党委和行政方面共同作出决定，取消计件工资制，相应地建立了新的奖励制。
    取消计件工资出现了新气象
    社会主义制度加共产主义思想，是我国现实生活的特征。我厂职工在取消了计件工资以后，在生产上出现了一片新气象，创造了计件时期从未有过的奇迹。总产值和劳动生产率提高了，废品率降低了，事故减少了。如磨床生产5月份只完成计划的70.1％，6月份取消了计件，完成了计划的117.9％；废品率5月份是3.8％，6月份则下降到0.78％。随着计件工资的取消，工人阶级的内部团结增强了，大大加强了互相支援互相协作的精神。如装配车间，6月份九十五台的计划眼看完不成，这在过去是很难调动人的，取消计件后却很快得到其他车间的支援，结果超额十七台完成了任务。又如有一钳工小组，过去计件工人作的活给他们加工，总不能按期完成，现在月月超额，如6月份完成138％，7月份完成132.4％，8月份完成141％。
    特别值得提出的是8月份超额完成球磨机的战斗任务。原计划三十台，争取五十台，后来看到群众热情很高，又增到七十台，争取八十五台。最后党委传达了市委的指示，并提出了苦战一周，争取超额的战斗号召，职工群众干劲冲天，都以战斗的姿态，组织参加突击队，有些原来拿计件工资的工人连续战斗二十四小时不下火线，最后超额十五台完成了任务。这种情况是历史上所没有过的。当然，这些成绩是多方面的，但主要的一条是政治挂了帅，思想上插了红旗，取消了计件工资，扫除了前进道路上的阻力，为生产大跃进铺平了道路。
    目前我厂职工正迈着雄伟的步伐，用共产主义的劳动态度，向着更大胜利的道路上飞跃前进。
