Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: The Third Beijing People's Sports Meet, lasting seven days, closed this afternoon. This meet selected a group of excellent athletes who will form the core of the team representing the capital's people at the First National Games next year.

The results of the competition were announced: Capital Higher Education Institutions took first place with 2189 points in total. Haidian District and Chaoyang District took second and third place with 1109 points and 945 points respectively. The performance of seventeen athletes reached the Master of Sport standard, and more than three thousand athletes reached the graded athlete or junior-grade athlete standard. The athletes lived up to the expectations of the people of the capital, breaking a total of eight national records and twenty-nine Beijing municipal records. The eight national records were broken in the men's 100-kilometer and women's 50-kilometer road cycling, the 10-kilometer race walking, the men's 200-meter low hurdles, the 110-meter high hurdles, the featherweight snatch, the heavyweight clean and jerk, and the marathon. In some events, several or even a dozen athletes broke the record simultaneously, which is a gratifying phenomenon in sports.

More than five thousand athletes from all walks of life fully demonstrated the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, characteristic of communism, thereby creating excellent results for the meet. For example, Yu Zuoji, who broke the national marathon record, is a 19-year-old student. He had previously heard that participating in a marathon required three to five years of training and that the age should be at least twenty-five, and that one should have a full month of rest before the race. Initially, he was intimidated by this and did not dare to participate because he did not have such conditions. Later, he boldly broke this superstition, began to train hard, and was determined to launch a "satellite." This time, he finally won second place in the competition with an excellent time of two hours, forty minutes, and thirty-six and two-tenths seconds. In addition, the meet also showed that communist morality is rapidly growing among the athletes. The atmosphere of mutual encouragement and mutual learning among athletes during the competition was better than in previous games. For example, when female athletes from Mentougou and Xuanwu districts competed in softball, the team members exchanged experiences on the spot, and applauded and congratulated each other every time the other side scored a point. During the meet, the two teams established a deep friendship.

    打破八项全国纪录和二十九项市纪录
    北京市体育运动大会闭幕
    新华社26日讯　历时七天的北京市第三届人民体育运动大会今日下午闭幕。这次大会选拔出了一批优秀的运动员，他们将是代表首都人民参加明年第一届全国运动会的基本队伍。
    大会公布比赛结果：首都高等院校以二千一百八十九分取得总分第一名，海淀区、朝阳区分别以一千一百零九分和九百四十五分取得总分第二、第三名。有十七名运动员的成绩达到健将标准，三千多名运动员的成绩达到等级运动员或少年级运动员的标准。运动员们没有辜负首都人民的希望，他们一共打破了八项全国纪录和二十九项北京市纪录。这八项全国纪录是：男子一百公里和女子五十公里公路自行车比赛、十公里竞走、男子二百公尺低栏、一百一十公尺高栏、次轻级推举、重量级抓举、马拉松赛跑。其中有些项目是好几名以至十几名运动员同时打破的，这是体育运动中可喜的现象。
    来自各个方面的五千多名运动员在这次大会上充分发挥了敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，从而为大会创造了优秀的成绩。如破马拉松赛跑全国纪录的于佐吉，他是十九岁的青年学生，以前听说参加马拉松比赛必须有三、五年的锻炼，年纪也必须在二十五岁以上，在比赛前还得有一个月的充分休息。开始他被这种说法吓住了，不敢参加比赛，因为他不具有这样的条件。后来他大胆地破除了这种迷信，开始刻苦锻炼，并立志要放射“卫星”，这次他终于以二小时四十分三十六秒二的优异成绩获得了这项比赛的第二名。另外，从这次大会上还看出共产主义的道德品质正在运动员中间迅速成长，比赛中运动员们互相鼓舞、互相学习的风气要比历届运动会更好。如门头沟和宣武区的女运动员们比赛垒球时，队员们当场交流经验，对方每得一分这方便鼓掌祝贺，在大会期间两队建立了深厚的友谊。
