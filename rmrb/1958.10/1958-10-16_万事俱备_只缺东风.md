All is Ready, Except for the East Wind

At the National Rope Traction Machine Conference, Comrade Tan Zhenlin called for striving to promote rope traction machines to all communes and teams across the country within a month. Now more than twenty days have passed, but the promotion of this advanced tool is still not widespread. Many places have promoted it very little, and some are even blank.

At the Rope Traction Machine Conference, representatives from various places unanimously recognized it as the most suitable deep plowing tool among the creations of the masses in various places. But why is the promotion so slow? There are many reasons, but judging from the situation in many places, the main reason is that conservative thinking is at play. The two different examples of the Xiaoji People's Commune and the Qingyang People's Commune published in this newspaper today are two different typical representatives of advanced and conservative thinking in the promotion of rope traction machines.

The emergence of any new thing will inevitably be blocked and opposed by all kinds of conservatives. The promotion of rope traction machines is no exception. The most common argument of this conservative thinking is "the conditions are different, and general requirements cannot be made." Some people say that sandy soil can be used, but sticky soil cannot be used; some people say that flat land can be used, but mountainous land cannot be used; and some people think that "the masses are not used to it, and using this tool is not as convenient as a large shovel." All kinds of arguments, like tight hoops, have trapped the heads of these conservatives.

This situation cannot help but remind people of the fate encountered by the double-wheeled double-share plow in 1955. At that time, weren't there many places where the double-share plow became a "sleeping plow" and a "hanging plow" because they emphasized "unsuitable conditions"? It was not until the revolutionary storm of the Great Leap Forward in the second half of last year that the double-wheeled double-share plow regained its prestige and restored its reputation. It seems that to promote rope traction machines across the country, a revolutionary storm must also be launched to break conservative thinking.

The most effective weapon to eliminate conservative thinking is practice. The progress of deep plowing work in Jiangsu Province in the past month is the first test of rope traction machines. Their experience is that in areas where politics takes command and promotion is actively carried out, the progress of deep plowing is both fast and the quality is good. The Xiaoji People's Commune is the most vivid example. As a result of their bold use, comprehensive promotion, and continuous improvement, the general work efficiency has increased by ten times compared with manual labor, and the highest has been able to cultivate nine acres of land per day, thus completing the autumn plowing task eight days ahead of schedule. This is the most powerful answer to those who advocate "conditional arguments" and "inconvenient arguments."

It is worth mentioning that the promotion of rope traction machines is not only for this year's autumn plowing, but more importantly, it is an important link in agricultural mechanization and electrification. Today it is for deep plowing, and further on it can be used for weeding, sowing, and transplanting rice seedlings. Today it is driven by human and animal power, and tomorrow it can be gradually pulled by mechanical and electric power. Although it is still very simple today, it can be gradually improved to reach a completely ideal level. In short, rope traction machines are tools with great development prospects. Even in areas where they are not used and promoted in autumn plowing for the time being, they should still be widely used and promoted in future production. Therefore, this struggle between advanced and conservative seems to be unavoidable.

The current situation is that the overall situation of comprehensively promoting rope traction machines has been determined, the technical experience related to this advanced tool has also been exchanged at the on-site meeting, and the promotion tasks in various places have also been clarified. All is ready, except for the east wind. What is this east wind? It is that politics takes command, and the political and ideological leadership of the Party. We must stir up a strong east wind on the deep-plowed land this year, insert red flags on the rope traction machines, dispel conservative thinking, and let this rope traction machine with infinite vitality blossom and bear fruit across the country.

    万事俱备  只缺东风
    全国绳索牵引机会议上，谭震林同志曾号召力争在一个月的时间内，把绳索牵引机推广到全国所有的社、队。现在已经过去了二十多天了，可是这一先进工具的推广还很不普遍。许多地方推广得很少，有些甚至还是空白。
    绳索牵引机会议上，各地代表们曾经一致公认它是各地群众创造中的一种最合要求的深耕工具，但为什么推广得很慢呢？原因是很多的，但是就不少地方的情况来看，主要原因是保守思想在作怪。本报今天登载的小纪人民公社和青暘人民公社的两个不同的例子，就是目前在推广绳索牵引机中先进和保守思想的两个不同的典型代表。
    任何新的事物的出现，都必然会遭受到形形色色的保守主义者的阻拦和反对。绳索牵引机的推广也不例外。这种保守思想最普遍的论调就是“条件不同，不能一般要求”。有人说沙土地能用，粘土地不能用；有人说平地能用，山地不能用；又有人认为“群众不习惯，使用这个工具还不如大锹来得方便”。形形色色的论调，像紧箍咒一样套住了这些保守主义者的脑袋。
    这种情况，不免使人想起了1955年双轮双铧犁所遭遇到的命运。那时岂不是也有很多地方因强调“不合条件”使双铧犁变成了“睡犁”、“挂犁”的吗？直到去年下半年，一场大跃进的革命风暴，才使双轮双铧犁扬眉吐气，恢复了名誉。看来，要在全国推广绳索牵引机，也非得来一场革命的风暴，大破保守思想不可。
    破除保守思想最有效的武器就是实践。江苏省一个月来深翻工作的进度，是对绳索牵引机的第一个考验。他们的经验是，凡是政治挂帅、积极推广的地区，深翻进度既快，质量又好。小纪人民公社就是最生动的一例。他们大胆使用，全面推广，不断改进的结果，一般工效比人力提高了十倍，最高的已经可以日耕地九亩，因而提前八天完成了秋耕任务。这是对那些“条件论”和“不方便论”者的最有力的回答。
    值得提出的是，推广绳索牵引机不但为了今年的秋耕，更重要的它是农业机械化电气化的重要环节。今天是为了深耕，再进一步就可以使用它除草、播种、栽秧，今天用人力、畜力带动，明天就可逐步用机力和电力牵引。今天虽然还很简单，但可以逐步改善提高，达到完全理想的程度。总之，绳索牵引机是一种有远大发展前途的工具，即使目前在秋耕中来不及使用和推广的地区，仍要在今后的生产中广泛使用和推广它。因此，这一场先进与保守的斗争看来是免不了的了。
    目前的情况是全面推广绳索牵引机的大局已经定了，有关这一先进工具的技术经验也已在现场会议上交流了，各地推广的任务也明确了。万事俱备，只缺东风。这东风是什么呢？就是政治挂帅，党的政治思想领导。我们要在今年的深耕土地上刮起一阵强烈的东风，在绳索牵引机上插上红旗，驱散保守思想，让这个有着无限生命力的绳索牵引机在全国开花结果。
