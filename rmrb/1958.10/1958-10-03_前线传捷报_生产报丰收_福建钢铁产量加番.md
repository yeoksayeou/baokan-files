Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, October 2nd - While shouldering the heavy task of supporting the frontline's struggle against the enemy, the people of the Fujian frontline are also vigorously engaged in steel production. Triumphant news from the steel production front keeps arriving along with news of frontline victories.

The province's steel output in September reached 435.8 tons, with a peak daily output of more than 96 tons, 71 times more than the average daily output in August; iron output reached 9,495.9 tons, with a peak daily output of 1,533.8 tons, 17 times more than the average daily output in August.

Party committees at all levels in Fujian Province have shifted their focus of work to steel production, with the First Secretaries camping out by the furnaces. In particular, the recent emphasis on implementing the "small, indigenous, and mass" approach has greatly accelerated the progress of steel production. Comparing September 30th with September 26th, the province's daily iron output has quadrupled, and the number of iron smelting furnaces has increased nearly 27 times. Currently, the province has built 120 various converters for steelmaking and more than 14,400 iron smelting furnaces.

The people of the coastal areas of Fujian are extremely enthusiastic about steel production amidst the sound of artillery fire. A pioneer team washing iron sand at the Chenggong Township Iron Smelting Plant in Nan'an County, which faces the Greater and Lesser Jinmen Islands occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, often braves enemy shelling to seize and wash iron sand. Hong Changhu and five others washed more than 166,000 jin of iron sand in one day.

    前线传捷报　生产报丰收
    福建钢铁产量加番
    据新华社福州2日电　福建前线人民一面担负着支援前线对敌斗争的繁重任务，一面大搞钢铁生产，钢铁生产战线上的捷报伴随着前线胜利消息不时传来。
    全省9月份钢产量已达四百三十五点八吨，最高日产量达到九十六吨多，比8月份的平均日产量多七十一倍；铁产量达九千四百九十五点九吨，最高日产量达到一千五百三十三点八吨，比8月份的平均日产量多十七倍。
    福建省各级党委都已将工作重心转到钢铁生产上来，第一书记都在炉边扎营。特别是最近强调贯彻“小、土、群”方针，钢铁生产的进度大大加快。以9月30日与26日比，全省铁的日产量翻了三番，炼铁炉激增近二十七倍。目前全省已建成的各种炼钢转炉有一百二十座，炼铁炉有一万四千四百多座。
    福建沿海一带人民，在炮声隆隆声中搞钢铁生产的热情非常高。与蒋匪帮盘踞的大、小金门岛相对的南安县成功乡炼铁厂的一支洗铁砂先锋队，经常在敌人炮弹纷飞中抢洗铁砂。洪长火等六人，在一天共洗铁砂十六万六千多斤。
