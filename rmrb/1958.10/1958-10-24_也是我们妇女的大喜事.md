Also a Great Happy Event for Our Women
　　Fǎ Lán Yīng, Deputy Director of the Hongqi People's Commune, Haiyuan

Without the Communist Party, our Hui women would not have been able to stand up. In the past, Hui women couldn't see men, couldn't talk to men, and could only stay at home revolving around the stove. Only after liberation did we gain our freedom. I, a former child bride who was looked down upon, have also become a people's representative. This October, we established a people's commune here, and I was even elected as the director of the commune, which is something I never would have imagined.

After the establishment of the commune, we set up canteens, nurseries, and sewing factories, and women's labor power has been further liberated. We have more time to participate in labor and study culture just like men. This year, the male commune members have all gone up the mountains to mine and smelt iron, and all the farm work is done by us women. While participating in labor, we also squeeze out time to study culture. As a result, the status of women has been greatly improved, and women dare to speak in front of men.

Now, the autonomous region is about to be established. This is the Party's concern for our Hui people and a great happy event for us. I must unite everyone, run the commune well, and mobilize Hui women to actively participate in labor to quickly change the arid conditions of Haiyuan County!

    也是我们妇女的大喜事
    海原红旗人民公社副社长　法兰英
    没有共产党，我们回族妇女就翻不了身。过去，回族妇女不能见男人，不能和男人说话，只能蹲在家里围着锅台转。解放后，我们才翻了身。我这个过去被人看不起的童养媳，也成了人民代表。今年10月份，我们这里成立了人民公社，我还被选为公社社长，这真是我万万想不到的事情。
    公社成立后，我们办起了食堂、托儿所、缝纫工厂，妇女劳动力得到了进一步解放。我们有更多的时间，和男人一样参加劳动，学习文化。今年，男社员都上山采矿、炼铁，庄稼活都是我们妇女干的。在参加劳动的同时，我们还挤出时间学习文化。这样一来，妇女的地位大大提高了，女人也敢在男人面前说话了。
    现在，自治区快要成立了，这是党对我们回族人民的关怀，是我们的大喜事。我一定要团结大家，把公社办好，发动回族妇女积极参加劳动，迅速改变海原县的干旱面貌！
