Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: Linqu County, Shandong Province, which had never grown rice before, achieved an overall bumper harvest of 3,144 jin per mu on average from the planting of 5,005 mu of rice this year. The "satellite" field cultivated by the Hongxing Commune, covering one mu and one fen, even reached a yield of 10,211 jin per mu.

When Linqu County initially proposed trial planting of rice this year, some conservatives believed that "this stuff comes from the South, and it won't work if planted in the North." Some people agreed to grow rice, but opposed close planting, believing that close planting "would not yield a good harvest." In response to this situation, the county party committee first mobilized the masses to speak out and debate, breaking down superstitions. On the basis of increased understanding, the masses accepted the most advanced rice planting techniques and, in practice, developed a bold and original spirit, creating many advanced farming methods. For example, in terms of close planting, each mu of high-yield fields reached more than 40,000 clusters, and the "satellite" fields reached 88,000 clusters. In terms of pest control, experiments using a mixture of "666" powder and lime sprayed on rice seedlings not only achieved 100% insecticidal efficiency, but also had the effect of preventing rice blast, thereby ensuring that the rice fields were free of pests and diseases. The party committees at all levels provided very specific leadership in rice management, adopting a method of combining cadres, commune members, and technicians for land preparation, transplanting, and rice field management. In operations such as transplanting and fertilizing, the county and township party secretaries personally went to the site to provide specific guidance.

    山东临朐县一步跨江南
    第一次试种水稻亩产三千多斤
    新华社济南21日电　山东省从未种过水稻的临朐县，今年种植五千零五亩水稻获得了平均亩产三千一百四十四斤的全面大丰收。红星公社培植的一亩一分“卫星”田，亩产更达到一万零二百一十一斤。
    临朐县今年在开始提出试植水稻时，一些保守派曾认为“这玩艺出在南方，在北方种就不行。”有些人赞成改水稻，但又反对密植，认为密植“得不到好收成”。根据这种情况，县委首先发动群众鸣放辩论，破除迷信；在认识提高的基础上，群众接受了最先进的种稻技术，并在实践中发扬大胆独创精神，创造了许多先进的耕作方法。例如在密植方面，丰产田每亩都达到四万墩以上，“卫星”田达到八万八千墩。在治虫方面，试验用“六六六”粉与石灰的合剂喷撒在稻秧上，不但杀虫效率100％，而且有防治稻瘟病的作用，从而保证了稻田无病虫害。各级党委在水稻管理上领导非常具体，采取干部、社员、技术员三结合的方式进行整地、插秧、稻田管理。在插秧、施肥等操作中，县、乡党委书记都是亲临现场，进行了具体指导。
