At the banquet, the head of the delegation, Lieutenant General Dorj, sternly condemned the recent continuous military provocations by U.S. imperialism in China's Taiwan and coastal areas. Lieutenant General Dorj stated that in the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands, the Mongolian people and the soldiers of the Mongolian People's Army firmly stand with the fraternal Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and wish the Chinese people final victory in this great struggle.

We have personally witnessed the remarkable achievements made by the hardworking Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction, and met the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who are defending their motherland. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, while continuously strengthening their political and military training, also engage in labor in factories, mines, and fields together with the people of the whole country, making great contributions to the socialist construction of their country. This clearly shows that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the army of the people themselves.
