The First People's Commune
    ——Visiting Ant Island After Five Years of Township-Commune Integration
    By our reporter Yi Xintian

    Third Visit to Ant Island
    This is my third visit to Ant Island in the Zhoushan Islands. I remember the first time, not long after the liberation of Ant Island, the tragic scene of severe destruction by the Chiang Kai-shek army was still vivid. Broken boats and torn nets were everywhere. The second time was in 1954, after the island established fishing cooperatives. What I saw was a thriving new look. This time, Ant Island has completely changed again. After boarding the Ant Island Commune's ship at Shenjiamen Fishing Port, it took more than two hours to reach Ant Island. Pairs of motorized junks with the words "Ant Island Commune" written on them immediately caught my eye. Then I saw small blast furnaces, processing plants, radio stations, cultural palaces, assembly halls, homes for the elderly, Red and Expert Universities, people's hospitals, and newly installed electric lights and telephones... There were so many new things.
    Ant Island is a red banner in the Zhoushan Islands, and people from all over have been visiting continuously for years. Why has Ant Island's production and all its work always been at the forefront? After Chairman Mao pointed out that the People's Commune was good, people realized: this island had been practicing township-commune integration and the comprehensive combination of workers, peasants (fishermen), merchants, students, and soldiers for five years, and it already essentially had the nature of a People's Commune. Therefore, it showed more advantages than ordinary fishing cooperatives, promoted the rapid development of productive forces, and enabled the island's fishermen to get rid of poverty and move towards prosperity. Ant Island now has millions in commune income, and each household has three thousands: the average public accumulation of the entire commune exceeds one thousand per household, the average net income per household reaches one thousand, and the cumulative investment deposits average one thousand per household. This figure greatly exceeds the total assets of wealthy fishermen.

    One Island, One Township, One Commune
    Ant Island is located southeast of Zhoushan Island, facing Shenjiamen Fishing Port. The whole island is six square kilometers, with a total of 586 households and 2,717 people. More than 90% are fishermen engaged in fishing production. In 1953, under the leadership of the Party, the island's fishermen organized four fishing cooperatives. In that year, the output of fishery increased several times. The public accumulation increased from only ten yuan when the cooperatives were established to 13,000 yuan. Each fishing cooperative increased its boats and nets and actively expanded fishery production.
    For more than two hundred years, Ant Island has been engaged in offshore fishing operations. In the expansion of production, the limited offshore fishing grounds became the object of competition. Disputes between cooperatives continued to occur due to competition for good fishing grounds. However, due to the small size and lack of funds, it was difficult to develop deep-sea fishing operations. Therefore, members of each cooperative had the desire to merge. In the spring of 1954, after analyzing and studying the above situation, the Ant Island Party Branch, through discussions with cooperative cadres and members, merged the four cooperatives into one large cooperative. Since then, Ant Island has always been one island, one township, and one commune.
    For five years since Ant Island implemented one township, one commune, there have been two organizations with the same staff, integrating the township and the commune. The three cadres of the township are also commune cadres. The management committee members and members' representatives of the fishing cooperative are generally members of the township people's committee and township people's representatives. The county's various tasks and all administrative affairs of the township are implemented in the commune.
    After Ant Island merged small cooperatives into large cooperatives and implemented township-commune integration, it immediately unified the arrangement of fishing grounds and unified the allocation of manpower and materials of each small cooperative. The original contradictions of each cooperative competing for offshore fishing grounds were quickly resolved. The labor and fishing gear of each production team were also balanced, and various fishing techniques were exchanged through manpower allocation. More importantly, the large commune had more people and more funds, and deep-sea fishing, which had never existed in history, continued to develop. In two years, 150,000 yuan was accumulated, and at the same time, members were mobilized to invest more than 100,000 yuan. Relying on these public accumulations, the commune built large fishing boats and motorized junks.

    Five Cooperatives Merged into One
    After Ant Island merged small cooperatives into large cooperatives and implemented township-commune integration, production developed rapidly. However, the supply and marketing cooperative could not meet the needs, and it was difficult to sell the fish in time, resulting in a lot of spoilage. The supply of fishing gear fell short of demand, and the credit cooperative also experienced financial difficulties. Therefore, in the spring of 1955, with the help of the working group of the CPC Zhoushan Prefectural Committee, the integration of production, supply and marketing, and credit cooperatives began. A supply and marketing department and a credit department were established under the fishing cooperative. The integration of the three cooperatives played a great role in promoting production, but in less than a year, due to the impact of the "saddle shape" on the overall work, the supply and marketing cooperative's consumer goods section and the credit cooperative were separated again.
    Since last year, the all-people rectification on Ant Island has blossomed and borne fruit, and fishery production has advanced by leaps and bounds. However, the island's supply and marketing cooperative, credit cooperative, handicraft cooperative, and the agricultural cooperative organized by fishermen's families all had some contradictions with the fishing cooperative. In March of this year, with the help of the working group of the CPC Putuo County Committee, the Ant Island Party General Branch launched a mass airing of views, a mass debate: "Should we implement the merger of the five cooperatives? What are the benefits of merging the five cooperatives?" Through debate, the members of each cooperative overcame some wrong ideas, eliminated the concerns of some members about suffering losses, and unanimously agreed to merge the five cooperatives. Therefore, the Ant Island Fishing Cooperative was further expanded and became an all-encompassing large cooperative, and the entire island became a large family. The large cooperative established fishery, agriculture, and handicraft production teams and supply and marketing and credit departments.
    For half a year since the merger of the five cooperatives, the entire island has become a whole, and workers, peasants (fishermen), merchants, students, and soldiers have twisted into one rope, generating tremendous power.
    First of all, it concentrated the funds of the entire cooperative, expanded public accumulation, and used it for various production and construction projects and cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings. In the past six months, six pairs of motorized junks have been newly built, doubling the number built in the past few years. With more funds, the island quickly established 183 factories, including large-scale aquatic product joint processing plants, machinery repair plants, steel plants, and fishing net factories.
    In addition, the island's cultural, educational, and welfare undertakings are also increasing. Recently, the Fishery Red and Expert University, Fishery Middle School, Maritime Middle School, Cultural Palace, Library, Obstetrics Hospital, Scientific Research Institute, etc. have been established.
    After the merger of the five cooperatives, manpower and materials have also greatly increased, and the entire cooperative has unified allocation and use according to the needs of production development. First of all, more than 300 laborers were transferred from the fishery, agriculture, and handicraft production teams to participate in industrial production. At the same time, more than 40 strong male and female members were transferred from the agricultural team to support the fishery team in developing deep-sea production. After the entire cooperative popularized public canteens, nursery classes, childcare centers, and sewing and washing groups, all women, elderly semi-laborers, and the old, weak, and disabled took on work that they could do, so that no one was idle. All fishing gear and farm tools on the island were also fully utilized, each in its place.
    "The front (going out to sea) and the rear support each other, and all walks of life cooperate," is a prominent feature after the merger of the five cooperatives. During the summer fishing season this year, the deep-sea and offshore teams went out to sea to catch yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and jellyfish. The workers, farmers, and fishermen in the rear rushed to knot more than 300 fishing nets day and night. In particular, the female members continuously twisted straw ropes and knotted more than 500 fishing nets for five days and five nights, which increased the production of fish by more than 200,000 jin for the offshore team. The supply and marketing department and the credit department also supported fishery production by purchasing and supplying fishing gear, transporting and selling fish, and issuing funds. The Fishery Middle School and the Maritime Middle School vigorously carried out technological reforms. Therefore, the output of this summer fishing season was unprecedented in history, and one fishing season was equal to the total output of last year.
    The merger of the five cooperatives has brought about tremendous changes in the nature of the Ant Island Fishing Cooperative, promoted the high-speed development of productive forces, and has been unanimously praised by the people of the island. After Chairman Mao pointed out that the People's Commune was good, Ant Island quickly turned into a People's Commune on the basis of the merger of the five cooperatives.

    Marching Towards Technology
    With the continuous improvement of fishing tools, the fishermen of Ant Island have mastered modern fishing techniques. After the merger of the five cooperatives on Ant Island in March this year, the cooperative immediately transferred a group of outstanding young male and female members from the fishery, agriculture, and handicraft production teams to Zhoushan and Shanghai to learn to be engine operators. At the same time, a large number of technical talents were trained through the method of apprenticeships. Now more than 20 young people have become specialized talents such as old track (engine operator) and fueler, and they are driving motorized junks to fish everywhere. In recent years, Ant Island has trained a total of 122 deep-sea fishing technicians, and they have become skilled fishing experts.
    After the Ant Island Cooperative put forward the slogan of working hard for three years to realize mechanized fishing, it also formulated a plan to train 250 technicians for fishing vessels, electrical processing, and other complete sets of technologies. The engine, electrical, and aquatic product departments of the newly established Fishery Red and Expert University already have more than 40 students studying while working. This university is also preparing to increase the number of students to 228. The Fishery Middle School and the Maritime Middle School are also training various technical talents. Countless new forces that are both red and expert are growing and expanding on this small island.

    Distribution System
    For the past three years, Ant Island has been implementing a distribution system close to the wage system of "assessing base points, pre-paying monthly, distributing annually, and rewarding by fishing season." That is, in different fishing seasons, according to various production contents and each member's labor and technical conditions, the base points of each person are assessed, and the monthly prepayment quota and the daily remuneration of each labor day are basically fixed. In 1957, the average monthly prepayment for each labor day was eight jiao. Members with more base points could pre-pay 44 yuan per month, while general members pre-paid about 32 yuan. The difference in prepayment was made up at the end of the year. There are commission rewards for completing the plan ahead of schedule.
    After the establishment of the People's Commune on Ant Island, the members unanimously agreed to change the monthly prepayment to a wage system.

    Poor Island Becomes Rich Island
    Without mentioning the poverty of the past, the prosperity of today cannot be shown. What was the life of the fishermen of Ant Island like in the past? Before liberation, the Kuomintang traitor army destroyed more than 10,000 offshore pile bamboos on the entire island, most of the fishing boats were destroyed, and the fishermen's property was looted. "Grass roots, dug clean, bitter lotus vegetables, swallowed whole, children sold to Shenjiamen, young women sold to Zhitou." This is a true portrayal of the tragic life of the island's fishermen at that time. What about now? Please listen to the masses' praise! "Little Ant Island, a completely new look, output is high year after year, life is good day by day, motorized junks are built in pairs, fishing vessel production is about to arrive, thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's blessing, the poor island has become a golden house."
    Now, the public accumulation and public property of the Ant Island People's Commune has exceeded one million, and the public property of the entire island accounts for more than 90% of all public and private property. With the development of production and the increase of income, the economic and cultural life of the fishermen of Ant Island has also rapidly improved. Now every fisherman's family on the island has savings, and every family invests in the commune, ranging from several thousand yuan to hundreds of yuan. More than 50 poor fishermen who used to live in thatched huts have now moved into more than 100 newly built tile houses. More than 1,000 dilapidated houses on the island have been repaired successively in recent years. The vast majority of fishermen have exceeded the income level of wealthy local fishermen.
    More than 480 people on the island have entered primary schools, middle schools, and universities. All school-age children have enrolled, and all young and middle-aged fishermen have a cultural level above junior high school. In the cultural palace, the fishermen have organized their own drama teams, song and dance teams, and basketball teams, and cultural life is very active.
    The continuous reform of fishing tools marks the leap-forward development of productive forces. Since 1954, Ant Island has gone from broken boats and small boats to new boats and large boats. Now there are nine pairs of motorized junks, and it is planned to develop to 13 pairs this year. The commune has proposed to work hard for two years to build ten pairs of fishing vessels. The fishermen's dream of mechanized fishing is about to come true.
    The people of Ant Island are running towards the communist prospect non-stop. This year, the planned output is to increase tenfold compared to last year, and the income is to reach more than 6 million yuan. Now, drying, transportation, electrical processing plants, and docks are being built at an accelerated pace. Recently, Ant Island has successively realized a non-illiterate island, a healthy island, an eight-no island, a green island, and a safe island... The future Ant Island is a paradise on the sea in our country and a banner among the fishing islands in our country.

    第一个人民公社
    ——访五年来乡社合一的蚂蚁岛
    本报记者　伊心恬
    三访蚂蚁岛
    我到舟山群岛的蚂蚁岛访问，这已经是第三次了。记得第一次是在蚂蚁岛解放后不久，那时遭受蒋军严重摧残破坏的惨象犹历历在目，破船烂网，到处都是；第二次是在岛上办了渔业合作社以后的1954年，看见的是一片欣欣向荣的新面貌；这次访问，蚂蚁岛又完全变了样。在沈家门渔港坐上蚂蚁公社的航船，两个多小时就到了蚂蚁岛。海上停着一对对写有蚂蚁社字号的机帆船首先吸引了我。接着看到的是小高炉、加工厂、广播站、文化宫、大会堂、幸福院、红专大学、人民医院，还有新装设的电灯、电话……新鲜事物实在太多了。
    蚂蚁岛是舟山群岛的一面红旗，各地前来参观访问的人连年不断。为什么蚂蚁岛的生产和各项工作一直跑在前面？当毛主席指出人民公社好后，人们才明确了：这个海岛五年来实行一乡一社、乡社合一，和工农（渔）商学兵全面结合，早已经基本上是人民公社的性质，因而显示了比一般渔业社有着更多的优越性，推动了生产力迅速发展，使全岛渔民摆脱贫困，走向富裕。现在的蚂蚁岛已经是社有百万收入，户有三个一千：全社公共积累平均每户超过一千，纯收入每户平均达到一千，投资存款累计平均每户也有一千。这个数字大大超过了富裕渔民所有的家当。
    一岛一乡一社
    蚂蚁岛位于舟山本岛的东南面，和沈家门渔港遥遥相对，全岛方圆六平方里，共有居民五百八十六户，二千七百一十七人，90％以上都是从事渔业生产的渔民。1953年岛上渔民在党的领导下，组织了四个渔业社。这一年渔业产量提高几倍，公共积累由办社时仅有十元增加到一万三千元，各渔业社就增船添网，积极扩大渔业生产。
    蚂蚁岛二百多年来都是从事近洋捕渔作业。在扩大生产中，有限的近洋渔场就成为争相发展的对象。各社因争好渔场不断发生纠纷，但由于社小资金少，又很难发展远洋捕鱼作业，因此各社社员都有并社的要求。1954年春，蚂蚁乡党支部分析研究了上述情况后，通过社干部和社员讨论，把四个社合并为一个大社。从此以后，蚂蚁岛就一直是一岛一乡一社了。
    蚂蚁岛实行一乡一社五年来，一直是两个机构，一套人马，乡社合一。乡里三个干部也是社干部。渔业社的管理委员、社员代表一般都是乡人民委员会委员、乡人民代表，县的各项工作和乡里所有行政事务都在社里贯彻执行。
    蚂蚁岛小社并大社、实行乡社合一后，立即统一安排渔场，统一调配各小社的人力物力，原来各社互争近海渔场的矛盾很快的解决了，各生产队的劳力、渔具也平衡了，而且通过人力调配，互相交流了各种捕鱼技术。更重要的是社大人多资金多，历史上没有过的远洋捕鱼也就不断发展了。两年中积累了十五万元，同时发动社员投资十多万元，社里依靠这些公共积累建造了大捕船和机帆船。
    五社合一
    蚂蚁岛小社并大社、乡社合一后，生产迅速发展。但是供销社不能满足需要，鱼货很难及时推销，烂掉不少，渔具供不应求；信用社也不断发生资金困难。因此，1955年春，在中共舟山地委工作组的帮助下，就开始实行生产、供销、信用三社合一，在渔业社下面设立供销部和信用部。三社合一后，对促进生产起了很大作用，但不到一年，由于整个工作受到“马鞍形”的影响，供销社生活资料部分和信用社又分了出来。
    去年以来，蚂蚁社全民整风开花结果，渔业生产突飞猛进，但岛上的供销社、信用社、手工业社和渔民家属组织的农业社都和渔业社发生一些矛盾。今年3月间，在中共普陀县委工作组帮助下，蚂蚁岛党总支发动社员大鸣大放大辩论，“要不要实行五社合一？五社合一有什么好处？”各社社员通过辩论，克服了一些错误想法，消除了某些社员怕吃亏的顾虑，一致赞成五社合一。于是蚂蚁渔业社又进一步扩大了，成为一个无所不包的大社，全岛成为一个大家庭。大社下面设立渔业、农业、手工业生产队和供销、信用两个部。
    五社合一半年来，全岛成为一个整体，工农（渔）商学兵拧成一股绳，产生了巨大的力量。
    首先集中全社资金，扩大公共积累，用于各项生产建设和兴办文教福利事业。半年来新建造了六对机帆船，比过去几年建造的增加一倍。资金多了，岛上迅速地办起了一百八十三个工厂，其中有规模较大的水产联合加工厂、机械修配厂、钢铁厂、渔网厂等。
    此外，岛上文教福利事业也越来越多了，最近办起来的有渔业红专大学、渔业中学、海上中学、文化宫、图书馆、产科医院、科学研究所等等。
    五社合一后，人力物力也大大增加了，全社根据生产发展需要，进行统一调配和使用。首先从渔业、农业、手工业生产队里抽调了三百多劳力参加工业生产，同时从农业队里抽调四十多身强力壮的男女社员支援渔业队发展远洋生产。全社普及了公共食堂、幼儿班、托儿所、缝洗组以后，所有妇女、老年半劳力和老弱残废，都担任了力能胜任的工作，做到不闲一个人；岛上所有渔具、农具也充分利用起来，各得其所。
    “前方（出海）后方互支援，各行各业大协作”，是五社合一后一个显著的特点。今年夏季渔汛中，远洋队和近洋队出海大捕黄鱼和墨鱼、海蜇，后方的工人、农民、渔民就日夜突击结绳网三百多顶。特别是妇女社员连续五天五夜搓草绳结网五百多顶，使近洋队因此增产鱼货二十多万斤。供销部、信用部也从采购供应渔具、运销鱼货和发放资金等方面支援渔业生产；渔业中学、海上中学大搞技术改革。因此今年夏汛产量是历史上没有过的，一汛就等于去年全年产量。
    五社合一使蚂蚁岛渔业社性质起了巨大变化，推动了生产力高速度发展，受到全岛人民一致赞扬。当毛主席指出人民公社好后，蚂蚁岛在五社合一的基础上迅速地转为人民公社了。
    向技术进军
    随着捕鱼工具的不断改进，蚂蚁岛的渔民已经掌握了现代化的捕鱼技术。今年3月蚂蚁岛五社合一后，社里立刻从渔业、农业、手工业生产队抽调一批优秀青年男女社员到舟山、上海去学习轮机手，同时通过带徒弟办法培养大批技术人材。现在已经有二十多名青年成为老轨（轮机手）、加油等专门人材，他（她）们驾驶着机帆船到处捕鱼。几年来蚂蚁岛培养出远洋捕鱼技术人员共有一百二十二人，他们已成为熟练的捕鱼能手。
    当蚂蚁社提出苦战三年实现机械化捕鱼的口号后，又订出了培养渔轮、电气加工等全套技术人材二百五十人的规划。刚成立的渔业红专大学的轮机、电机、水产等系已有四十多个学员在半工半读，这个大学还准备把学员增加到二百二十八人。渔业中学、海上中学也在培养各种技术人材，无数的又红又专的新生力量正在这个小岛上成长、壮大。
    分配制度
    蚂蚁岛三年来一直实行接近工资制的“评定底分、按月预支、常年分配、汛汛奖励”的分配制度，就是在不同渔汛中根据各种生产内容和每个社员的劳力技术条件，评定每人的底分，基本上固定每月的预支定额和每个劳动日报酬。1957年中平均每月每个劳动日预支八角，底分多的社员每月可预支四十四元，一般社员预支三十二元左右，到年终分配时再补足预支的差数。超额完成计划的，有提成奖励。
    蚂蚁岛成立人民公社后，社员们一致赞同在按月预支基础上改为工资制。
    穷岛变富岛
    不说过去的贫穷，显不出今天的富裕。蚂蚁岛渔民过去的生活是怎样的呢？解放前国民党卖国贼军把全岛一万多支近洋桩竹全部破坏，渔船大多敲毁，渔民财物被抢劫一空。“草子根，挖干净，苦莲菜，整株吞，小娃卖给沈家门，小娘卖给峙头人。”这就是当时岛上渔民悲惨生活的写照。现在呢？请听群众的歌颂吧！“小小蚂蚁岛，完全新面貌，产量年年高，生活天天好，机帆船对对造，渔轮生产就要到，托共产党毛主席的福，穷岛变成黄金屋”。
    现在，蚂蚁人民公社公共积累和公共财产已经超过一百万了，全岛公共财产占所有公私财产90％以上。随着生产发展，收入增加，蚂蚁岛渔民的经济生活、文化生活也迅速提高。现在全岛渔民家家有存款，家家在社里投资，多的几千元，少的也有百多元；过去住茅房的五十多户贫苦渔民，现在搬进了新盖的一百多间瓦房；岛上一千多间年久失修的房子，几年来陆续进行了修理；绝大多数渔民已超过了当地富裕渔民的收入水平。
    岛上已有四百八十多人进了小学、中学、大学。学龄儿童已经全部入学，所有青壮年渔民都具有高小以上的文化程度。在文化宫里，渔民们自己组织了戏剧队、歌舞队、篮球队，文化生活很活跃。
    捕鱼工具的不断改革，标志着生产力的飞跃发展。蚂蚁岛1954年以来由破船、小船到新船、大船，现在已有机帆船九对，计划今年要发展到十三对，社里提出苦战两年建造渔轮十对。渔民们机械化捕鱼的理想就要实现了。
    蚂蚁岛人民一刻也不停地向着共产主义前景奔跑，今年计划产量要比去年增加十倍，收入要达到六百多万元。现在，烘干、运输、电气加工厂以及码头正在加紧兴建。近来，蚂蚁岛又接连实现了无文盲岛、健康岛、八无岛、绿化岛、安全岛……。未来的蚂蚁岛是我国海上的乐园，是我国渔岛中的一面旗帜。
