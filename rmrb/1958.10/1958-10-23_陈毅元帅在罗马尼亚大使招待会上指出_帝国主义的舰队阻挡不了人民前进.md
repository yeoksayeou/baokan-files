Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd. At a reception tonight, Vice Premier Chen Yi stated that the creative labor enthusiasm and solidarity demonstrated by the Chinese people, socialist countries, and the Asian and African people liberated through national independence movements in pursuit of a better life cannot be stopped by the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Fleets of imperialism. We will surely achieve even greater victories.

The reception was held by the Romanian Ambassador to China, Mr. Rudenco, and his wife, in honor of the Romanian Military Delegation led by General Salajan's visit to China.

General Salajan said at the reception that deep brotherly friendship closely unites the people and armies of Romania and China. The Romanian people and the government of the Romanian People's Republic fully support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their ancient territory. The Romanian people and the soldiers of the armed forces are proud to have such a sincere and powerful friend as the great Chinese people, and are sincerely happy for the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese working people and soldiers in their daily labor and work.

General Salajan expressed his gratitude for the warm reception he and his delegation received from the Chinese government and people, as well as the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, during their visit. He firmly believes that this visit by the Romanian Military Delegation will further strengthen the close cooperation and brotherly friendship between the people and armies of Romania and China.

Marshal Chen Yi delivered a speech. He said that the visit of the Romanian Military Delegation led by General Salajan is an honor for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We express our brotherly respect to the Romanian comrades and thank the Romanian people and peace-loving people all over the world for their support of our people's sacred struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands.

Marshal Chen Yi said that General Salajan and the comrades of the delegation visited many of our troops and saw the situation of the Great Leap Forward in our industrial and agricultural construction. They gave high praise to our construction achievements, which is a great encouragement to our people. Our people have shown lofty creative labor enthusiasm in order to build a socialist and beautiful life. Although we have made great achievements, we are not satisfied. While we have made achievements, there are still many shortcomings. We hope that General Salajan and his comrades will offer criticisms.

At the reception, Ambassador Rudenco also spoke.
