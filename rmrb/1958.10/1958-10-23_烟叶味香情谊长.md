The tobacco leaves are yellow and fragrant, each cigarette filled with lasting friendship; one box comes from the Pyongyang Textile Mill, one box from the Kumgangsan Farm.

The tobacco leaves are yellow and fragrant, the boxes are decorated so beautifully, I take out my small fountain pen and write: Thank you, Korean Workers' Party.

The tobacco leaves are yellow and fragrant, treasured friendship etched in my heart; carefully wrapped in a handkerchief to take back home, each warm heart crossing the river.

    烟叶味香情谊长
    文页烟叶黄，味儿香，支支香烟情谊长，一盒来自平壤纺纱厂，一盒来自金刚山农庄。烟叶黄，味儿香，盒子装璜顶漂亮，掏出我的小钢笔，写上：感谢朝鲜劳动党。烟叶黄，味儿香，珍贵友谊记心上，手绢包好带回国，颗颗热心跨过江。
