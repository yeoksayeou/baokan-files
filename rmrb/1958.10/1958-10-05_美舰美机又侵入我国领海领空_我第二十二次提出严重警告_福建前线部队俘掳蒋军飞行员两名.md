    American Warships and Aircraft Again Invade Our Territorial Waters and Airspace
    Our Twenty-Second Serious Warning
    Fujian Front Troops Capture Two Chiang Kai-shek Air Force Pilots
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th: From the night of October 3rd to the evening of the 4th, three American warships and twenty-eight fighter planes invaded our territorial waters and airspace over the Xiamen area of Fujian. A spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated under instruction that the Chinese government lodges its twenty-second serious warning against this serious military provocation by the United States.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 4th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops recently captured two Chiang Kai-shek air force personnel and recovered one Chiang Kai-shek body.
    The captured Chiang Kai-shek Captain Pilot Hua Wulin and Captain Co-pilot Liu Chengli were the two survivors from a transport plane shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery forces on September 29th while airdropping military supplies over Jinmen (Quemoy). Hua Wulin is from Qiaotou Town, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, and belongs to the Second Squadron of the 20th Battalion of the 6th Wing of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force. Because they sustained minor injuries when the plane crashed and were soaked in the seawater for too long, they have been sent to the hospital for treatment.
    The body is that of Chiang Kai-shek Army First Class Sergeant Xie Ronghua, from Luzhou, Sichuan Province, who was on the same plane. He has now been buried.

    美舰美机又侵入我国领海领空
    我第二十二次提出严重警告
    福建前线部队俘掳蒋军飞行员两名
    新华社4日讯　10月3日夜间到4日晚，美国军舰三艘、战斗机二十八架侵入我福建厦门地区的领海和领海上空。我外交部发言人奉命声明，对于美国的这种严重的军事挑衅，中国政府第二十二次提出严重警告。
    新华社福建前线4日电　中国人民解放军福建前线部队最近俘掳了蒋军飞行人员两名，打捞蒋军尸体一具。
    被俘的蒋军上尉飞行官华武驎、上尉副驾驶刘承理，是在9月29日到金门上空空投军用物资时，被我高射炮部队击落的一架运输机中幸存的两个人。华武驎是江苏句容县桥头镇人，属蒋空军第六联队二十大队二中队。因为他们在飞机坠落时受了轻伤，又在海水中浸泡过久，已送往医院治疗。
  尸体是同机上的蒋军陆军一级上士谢荣华，四川泸州人，现已埋葬。
