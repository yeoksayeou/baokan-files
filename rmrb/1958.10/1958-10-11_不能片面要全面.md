    Don't Be One-Sided, Be Comprehensive
    Zheng Guitang, a worker at the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, had long been at odds with Zhang Yuanhong, the production team leader. He always felt that Zhang Yuanhong was crude and blunt, full of shortcomings. Therefore, their relationship was uncoordinated, hindering the smooth progress of production. After studying philosophy, Zheng Guitang began to realize that his view was wrong. He said, "Only seeing other people's shortcomings and not seeing their advantages is committing the metaphysical error of one-sidedness. Although Zhang Yuanhong is crude, he is straightforward and honest, and his technical skills are very high. Although he has shortcomings, he also has advantages." He then took the initiative to talk with Zhang Yuanhong, resolving their misunderstandings, improving their mood, and improving production.

    不能片面要全面
    太原重型机器厂工人郑贵堂，长期同生产组长张元洪合不来，他总是感到张元洪这个人性情粗暴，态度生硬，尽是缺点，因此两个人关系不协调，妨碍了生产的顺利进行。郑贵堂学了哲学之后，开始认识到自己的看法不对，他说：“尽看人家的缺点，而看不到人家的优点是犯了形而上学的片面性的错误。张元洪虽然性情粗暴，但直爽坦白，且技术很高，虽有缺点，但也有优点。”他于是主动找张元洪谈了心，双方疙瘩解开了，心情愉快了，生产也搞好了。　（晋阳）
