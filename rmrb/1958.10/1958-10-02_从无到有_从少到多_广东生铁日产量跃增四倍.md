Guangzhou Dispatch from our newspaper, September 30th: Guangdong Province, which had absolutely no foundation in the iron and steel industry, relied on the masses and used indigenous methods and small blast furnaces to produce over 1,700 tons of pig iron and over 360 tons of steel on the 29th. On this day, the daily output of pig iron increased more than fourfold compared to the average daily output since September, and more than doubled compared to the highest output on the 28th.

Party secretaries at all levels throughout the province went deep to the furnace side to participate in and supervise the battle. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, they also led the soldiers of the Iron and Steel Army to build small blast furnaces and smelt pig iron using indigenous methods all night long. The Deputy Secretary of the Da Huai Township Party Committee in Enping County used white refractory mud to replace refractory bricks to build a blast furnace. The furnace was built in only two hours, and it took only five hours from lighting the furnace to tapping the iron. On average, each furnace could produce 80 jin of iron per hour, and the quality of the iron was very good. This high-speed method of building furnaces and smelting iron with more, faster, better, and more economical results bloomed everywhere in Enping on the 29th. The continuous steel production barrier that Guangzhou had not broken through for a long time was also broken today. Batches of small factories and small furnaces continuously produced 20, 30, and up to 50 furnaces of steel.

    从无到有　从少到多
    广东生铁日产量跃增四倍
    本报广州30日电　钢铁工业毫无基础的广东省，29日依靠群众，用土办法和小高炉炼出一千七百多吨生铁和三百六十多吨钢。这一天，生铁的日产量比9月份以来的平均日产量增长四倍以上，比最高产量的28日也增加二倍多。
    全省各级党委书记，普遍深入到炉边，参战和督战。中秋节日，他们还率领着钢铁师的战士们，通宵达旦地用土办法建小高炉、炼生铁。恩平县大槐乡党委副书记以白耐火泥带替耐火砖建高炉，两个小时即把炉子建成，从红炉到出铁只花五小时，平均每炉每小时可以出铁八十斤，铁的质量很好。这种多、快、好、省的高速度建炉炼铁法，29日已在恩平遍地开花。广州市长期未攻破的连续出钢关，今日也被攻破，成批小厂小炉连续出钢二十炉、三十炉，最高的达到五十炉。
