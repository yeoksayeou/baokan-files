    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th. TASS, Tokyo, 26th: In recent days, the Japanese political situation has become tense as conservative forces have begun to openly attack the rights and freedoms of the Japanese people. Kenji Miyamoto, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, answered questions from a "Pravda" reporter about the current situation in Japan.
    Miyamoto Kenji said that the current situation in Japan is somewhat similar to that in France. In both countries, the regimes of monopoly capital are gradually beginning to falter. The monopoly bourgeoisie of Japan and France are both using violent methods to suppress the democratic forces that oppose them. Given that the actions of the reactionary forces in France and Japan are supported by U.S. imperialism, it can be said that these actions of the reactionaries represent a new offensive launched by international imperialism against international democratic forces.
    He said that the specific situation in Japan differs from that in France in many ways. U.S. imperialist control over Japan is more severe, which creates a more dismal situation. However, on the other hand, in Japan, there is a great possibility of forming a united anti-American democratic front based on the rising anti-American sentiment among the people.
    The broadest masses of the people are participating in the struggle against arming Japan with atomic weapons, against using Japan as a base of aggression, against U.S. armed actions in the Taiwan Strait, and for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. The Japan Socialist Party is different from the French Socialist Party, and it is fighting in the ranks of the democratic camp.
    Miyamoto Kenji said that the victory of the cause of establishing a united front depends on the future efforts of all supporters of united action of democratic forces. In this regard, he emphasized the great significance of the 11th Extraordinary Congress of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan [Sohyo] held on October 24th. He said that Sohyo and its member unions will fight against the Kishi Nobusuke government with unprecedented determination. In Japanese history, there has never been a precedent in which all trade unions across the country have so resolutely and definitively expressed their determination to fight against the government without exception. Of particular note in this regard is that Sohyo intends to wage the struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to strengthen police power on the basis of the broadest front of democratic forces, including the Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party. This step by Sohyo will have real historical significance.

    宫本显治对“真理报”记者谈日本政局
    日本人民反美情绪空前高涨  民主力量可能组成统一阵线
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社东京26日讯：最近几天，由于保守势力开始公开向日本人民的权利和自由进攻，日本政治局势趋于紧张。日本共产党总书记宫本显治回答了“真理报”记者提出的有关日本目前局势的问题。
    宫本显治说，目前日本的局势在某种程度上类似法国的情况。在这两国中，垄断资本的政权逐渐开始动摇。日本和法国的垄断资产阶级都采用暴力的方法来镇压反对它的民主力量。鉴于法国和日本的反动势力的行动得到美帝国主义的支持，可以说，在反动派的这些行动中表现了国际帝国主义向国际民主力量发动的新的进攻。
    他说，日本的具体情况在许多方面又跟法国有所区别。美帝国主义对日本的控制表现得更加厉害，这就造成了更加暗淡的局势。但是，另一方面，在日本有在人民群众反美情绪高涨的基础上组成统一的反美民主阵线的很大的可能性。
    在反对用原子武器武装日本、反对利用日本作为进攻基地、反对美国在台湾海峡的武装行动和争取恢复日中邦交的斗争中，有最广泛的人民群众参加。日本社会党不同于法国社会党，它在民主阵营的队伍中进行斗争。
    宫本显治说，建立统一阵线事业的胜利取决于一切民主力量统一行动拥护者今后的努力。他在这方面强调了日本工会总评议会10月24日举行的第十一次临时大会的重大意义。他说，“总评”和它的会员工会将以空前的决心同岸信介政府作斗争。在日本的历史上还没有过全国所有的工会都毫不例外地如此坚决地和肯定地表现出自己同政府作斗争的决心的这样的前例。在这方面特别值得注意的是，“总评”打算在包括社会党和日本共产党在内的民主力量的最广泛的阵线的基础上来进行反对岸信介政府企图加强警察权力的法案的斗争。“总评”这个步骤会有真正的历史意义。
