Behind the "Hymns of Praise"
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

    When the British Queen welcomed West German President Heuss to London on the 20th, she said: "The tragic events in the past half-century of relations between our two countries have become part of history. Now we must look to the future..."

    Two weeks earlier, British Prime Minister Macmillan, during a visit to Bonn, expressed the same belief. He said: "We must forget those deep and tragic conflicts of the past and jointly envision the future..."

    These sweet hymns of praise paint such a splendid prospect for relations between the two countries.

    However, forgetting the past seems not difficult; dealing with reality, however, is not so easy. In fact, the current relationship between Britain and West Germany is not wonderful. If we compare the following comments from the West German press with the eloquent words of the British leaders, the trick is exposed. "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" said: The reaction of the British newspapers has been generally cold and unfriendly. It is noteworthy that "The Times" did not mention this official visit at all on its news pages; only one important newspaper mentioned it. "Rheinische Post" said: What is important is that even a figure like Theodor Heuss received such a cold reception. Problems obviously still exist in Anglo-German relations. "Morgenpost" put it more bluntly: Britain and West Germany are simply not "true friends."

    In reality, the conflict of interests between British and West German monopoly capital is much sharper and more extensive than the contradictions between Britain and any other Western European country. In 1953, Britain accounted for 21.2% of industrial exports in the capitalist world; by the first quarter of this year, it had fallen to 19%. During the same period, West Germany rose from 13.2% to 17.7%. The fact is so ruthless: In the past few years, every time West Germany's foreign trade expanded a step, Britain's foreign trade correspondingly shrank a step.

    West German goods and capital have not only invaded Britain's traditional overseas markets but have also successfully penetrated the British Commonwealth. While the West German President was leisurely touring Britain, the West German Finance Minister was traveling at full speed to Southeast Asian countries and African regions, seeking further expansion opportunities for West German monopoly capital. It is said that when Macmillan visited the United States in June this year, he strongly argued that the United States and West Germany have capital, and Britain has "experience," and the three countries should unite to develop backward countries. However, Britain has now been thrown aside, and West German and American companies have jointly established the "Middle East Industrial Development Program Company."

    The struggle surrounding the "European Common Market" reflects another aspect of the contradictions between Britain and West Germany. This new customs union, which excludes Britain, will be gradually established from January next year. There is no doubt that West Germany will firmly hold the first place in this group and reap the greatest benefits. On the other hand, Britain's proposed "Free Trade Area" has not yet materialized. Considering that Western Europe accommodates 28% of British exports in Britain's foreign markets, it can be seen how much of a threat the establishment of the Common Market poses to Britain.

    The contradictions between Britain and West Germany extend far beyond the economic field. A noteworthy phenomenon is that in Western Europe, a trend is emerging for West Germany and France to form a group to counter the monopoly position of the United States and Britain. This is a cause for anxiety for Britain, which has always played the "balance of power" game. This is one of the reasons why Macmillan has repeatedly visited Bonn and Paris recently. In addition, West Germany, France, and a supporting actor, Italy, have formed a Western European "nuclear weapons axis." Britain is worried that sooner or later, West Germany will replace Britain's position not only economically but also militarily.

    A few days ago, an article in the British "Daily Mail" wrote: "For the Germans, this will be the golden age in their post-war history. They believe that when the (West German) President and the Queen meet, they will no longer be considered an inferior nation." Indeed, West Germany is demanding more "respect" from Britain. And Britain, of course, will never easily give up its position as a minor leader in Western Europe under the American flag. The contradictions between Britain and West Germany are not subsiding but will further intensify.

### 在“赞美诗”的背后

    在“赞美诗”的背后
    本报记者  潘非
    英国女王20日在欢迎西德总统豪斯访问伦敦时说：“在过去半世纪中我们两国关系中的悲剧事件已成为历史的一部分。现在我们必须展望将来……”
    两个星期以前，英国首相麦克米伦在访问波恩时，表达了同样的信念。他说：“必须忘掉过去那些深重和惨烈的冲突，并且共同展视未来……”
    这些甜蜜蜜的赞美诗，为两国关系展开了一幅多么灿烂的前景。
    但是，忘记过去，似乎并不困难；而现实，却不太容易对付。事实上，目前英国同西德的关系，并不美妙。如果把下面几段西德报纸的评论，同英国首脑娓娓动听的言词对照一下，西洋镜就被拆穿了。“法兰克福汇报”说：英国报纸的反应基本上是冷淡和不友好的。值得注意的是，在“泰晤士报”的要闻版上只字未提及这次正式访问，只有一家重要的报纸提到这件事。“莱茵邮报”说：重要的是甚至像特奥多尔·豪斯这样一个人物还受到如此冷淡的接待。英德关系显然仍旧存在着问题。“午报”更说得坦率：英国和西德，根本谈不上是“真正的朋友”。
    实际上，英国同西德两国垄断资本间的利害冲突，比英国同任何一个西欧国家间的矛盾要尖锐得多，广泛得多。在1953年时，英国在资本主义世界的工业品出口中，还占21.2％，到今年第一季度，已跌到19％。而在同一时期内，西德则从13.2％上升到17.7％。事实是这样的无情：在已往几年中，每当西德的对外贸易扩展一步，英国的对外贸易便相应地缩减一步。
    西德的商品和资本，不仅侵入了英国在海外的传统市场，而且成功地打进了英联邦内部。当西德总统正在英国优游自得地游山玩水的时候，西德的财政部长正快马加鞭，访问东南亚各国和非洲地区，寻找西德垄断资本进一步扩张的机会。传说麦克米伦今年6月访美时，曾经力陈：美国和西德有资本，英国有“经验”，三国应该联合起来开发落后国家。但是，英国现在已被摔在一边，西德和美国公司已经联合成立了“中东工业发展计划公司”。
    围绕着“欧洲共同市场”的斗争，反映了英国同西德之间矛盾的另一个侧面。把英国排斥在外的这一新的关税同盟，将在明年1月起逐步建立。毫无疑问，西德在这个集团中将稳坐第一把交椅，并获得最大的好处。另一方面，英国所倡议的“自由贸易区”，则至今尚无眉目。如果考虑到在英国的国外市场中西欧容纳了英国出口商品28％这一事实，就可以看出共同市场的建立，对于英国有多大的威胁。
    英国和西德的矛盾，远远地超出于经济领域。一个值得注意的现象是，在西欧，正隐然出现由西德和法国联结成一个集团的趋势，以对抗美英的垄断地位。这对于一贯玩弄“均势政策”的英国来说，是个值得焦虑的问题。这就是为什么麦克米伦在最近一再访问波恩和巴黎的原因之一。此外，西德、法国，再加上一个配角意大利，已形成西欧的“核武器轴心”。英国担心着：迟早有一天，不仅在经济上，而且在军事上，西德都将取代英国的地位。
    几天以前，英国“每日邮报”的一篇文章写道：“对于德国人说来，这将是他们战后历史中的黄金时代。他们认为当（西德）总统和女王会晤的时候，他们就不再被认为是一个下等国家了。”的确，西德已在要求英国对它给予更多的“尊敬”。而英国，当然决不轻易放弃美国帅旗下的西欧小头目的地位。英国同西德之间的矛盾，不是在平息下去，而是将进一步地尖锐化。
