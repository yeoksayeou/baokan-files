More than 1,900 primary school students in the Baiyintao Sea District of Ongniud Banner, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, under the leadership of their teachers, formed 94 small teams and spent two to three hours each day carrying out gleaning activities. Since the gleaning activities began on September 22, they have gleaned 13,500 jin of grain in just four days. Eight hundred and forty children in Daxing Township gleaned more than 1,100 jin of grain in three hours. They gleaned very cleanly, picking up both large and small ears of grain, and putting any loose grains into baskets. The elementary school students were in high spirits while gleaning, singing while they gleaned, and composing slogans such as "Grain is the treasure of treasures, don't lose a single grain; accumulate little by little, sell it to the country, and support construction" to encourage each other. The gleaning activity is still ongoing.

    蒙族学生边拣边唱
    一颗一穗积少成多
    内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟翁牛特旗白音套海区的一千九百多名小学生，在教师们的领导下，组成九十四个小队，每天用二至三个小时的时间，开展拣粮活动。从9月22日开始拣粮以来，仅四天时间就拣粮一万三千五百斤。大兴乡的八百四十名儿童，三个小时就拣粮一千一百余斤。他们拣的很干净，不管大穗小穗都拣，不成穗的就往筐子里放。小学生们拣粮的情绪很高，一边拣一边唱，并编出“粮食宝中宝，一粒也别丢；一颗一穗，积少成多，卖给国家，支援建设”的口号，互相鼓舞。现在，拣粮活动仍在继续进行中。
