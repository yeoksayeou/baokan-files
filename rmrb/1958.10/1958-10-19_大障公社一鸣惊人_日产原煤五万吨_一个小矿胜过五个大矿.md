Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th: The Dazhang People's Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province, launched a coal "satellite" on the 15th, with the entire commune producing 50,700 tons of raw coal that day, equivalent to five times the daily output of five large coal mines in Hunan Province.

The Yangmeishan Coal Mine of the Dazhang People's Commune was a small mine with an average daily output of only eight tons before the 10th. After the province launched the high-yield week for iron and steel and coal, the commune members immediately caught up and launched a competition. Working hard day and night, they extracted 15,200 tons of coal in open-pit mining on the 13th.

Early on the 15th, Lu Guishan, a member of the county party committee, and Yang Fusheng, the commune director, led a labor army of 20,000 people, braving the rain to launch a fierce attack on the newly discovered seven mining points. They put forward the slogan "Not afraid of wind, not afraid of rain, not afraid of slipping, everyone produces 20 tons per day, everyone makes outstanding contributions" and launched a production competition. Liu Tingxian and seven others from Baiguoying carried 200 loads of coal in one hour. The greater the wind and rain, the higher people's enthusiasm. More than 20,000 people, none fell behind. They achieved unity of will, unity of tools, unity of mobilization, fast digging, fast loading, fast carrying, and fast completion of tasks. As a result of the day's battle, the average daily output per person reached more than two tons, creating an amazing miracle on the first day of the provincial high-yield week for iron and steel and coal.

When the news of the "satellite" launch spread, Pan Chunming, an old man over seventy years old living in Danzikeng, traveled eight li to the construction site. Seeing so much coal being mined, he beamed and said, "The Communist Party is really great. I have lived for dozens of years and only now have I seen so much good coal!" As he spoke, he picked up a carrying pole and started to carry. People advised him to rest, but he said, "This is enjoyment!" and refused to stop. Now they have投入入了新的战斗。 also投入入了新的战斗。

    大障公社一鸣惊人  日产原煤五万吨
    一个小矿胜过五个大矿
    新华社长沙18日电　湖南省醴陵县大障人民公社15日发射一颗煤炭卫星，全公社这天共产原煤五万零七百吨，等于湖南省五个大煤矿日产量的五倍。
    大障人民公社的杨梅山煤矿，10日以前还是个日产量平均只有八吨的小井煤矿。在全省开展钢铁煤炭高产周以后，社员们就急起直追，展开竞赛。掀山揭岭奋战三昼夜，在13日这天露天采煤一万五千二百吨。
    15日一早，县委委员路贵山和社长杨福生率领两万劳动大军，冒雨向新发现的七个矿点展开猛攻，他们提出了“不怕风，不怕雨，不怕滑，每人日产二十吨，各个立奇功”的口号，展开了生产比赛。白果营刘庭先等八人，一个钟头就挑煤二百担。风雨越大，人们的干劲越高。两万多人，没有一个下火线。他们做到了人心齐、工具齐、出动齐，挖得快、上得快、担得快、任务完成快。一天的战斗结果，平均每人日产量达到二吨以上，在全省钢铁煤炭高产周的第一天，创造了惊人的奇迹。
    当放射“卫星”的消息传出后，住在弹子坑的一位七十多岁的老人潘春明从八里外赶到了工地，他看到挖出这么多的煤炭，眉飞色舞地说：“共产党真伟大，我长了几十岁，才碰见这么多这样好的煤！”说着，拾起担子就挑。人们劝他休息，他说：“这是享福啊！”不肯歇下来。现在他们又投入了新的战斗。
