    Luoyang Teachers College Moves to Iron Ore Area to Refine Steel and People
    Combining Study, Production, and Schooling

    (Our dispatch) Reporter Chen Jian reports: In September, Luoyang Teachers College in Henan Province moved to the Xin'an County iron ore area, combining study, production, and schooling, refining steel and people, and setting a good example of integrating education with productive labor.

    In a wild area of the Xin'an County iron ore region, the college established simple school buildings. After more than a month of hard work, they have now built thirteen smelting blast furnaces, two hundred and twenty-four earthen furnaces, and seventy coking furnaces, and have mined millions of pounds of ore. They have established several specialized organizations, including mining teams, blasting teams, transportation teams, smelting teams, as well as chemical plants, iron factories, and wood factories. Teachers and students have taken on the entire production process, including prospecting, mining, blasting, transportation, furnace construction, and smelting. They are now producing large quantities of steel, with a production target of over a thousand tons for November.

    All the teachers and students of the school boldly innovated and thoroughly changed the old teaching and learning methods. On the smelting construction site, with steel as the key link, they created a lively new teaching content and learning method. Their slogan is: learn by the furnace, attend class on the ground, the construction site is the textbook. Each department has compiled a set of lecture notes according to production needs and listed it as a major course. The Physics Department teaches smelting, blast furnaces, and indigenous steelmaking methods; the History Department lectures on the emergence of steel and the role and significance of steel production in social development; the Geography Department discusses the ores of Daimei Village and the distribution of mining areas in Henan, as well as their development prospects; the Chemistry Department teaches prospecting, ore dressing, and blasting; and the Chinese Language Department speaks on the worldview of writers, and how the furnace, the ground, and the mines are the source of creation. In less than a month, the Chemistry Department successfully tested seventeen types of explosives with different properties at the blasting site, and now many factories and schools from other places have sent people to learn from them. Hundreds of scripts, dance dramas, and tens of thousands of poems and ballads have appeared by the furnaces, on the ground, and in the mines. They also held small exhibitions on the construction site, displaying models and charts of blast furnaces, and the types and properties of ores and steel.

    In this school, those with ability are teachers. Labor models from nearby factories and people's communes, and the Xin'an County Party Secretary are all their teachers; students who have made creations and inventions can also take the stage to teach. The students in the Chemistry Department who invented seventeen kinds of explosives give chemistry lessons to the students of the same department, and the teachers also listen and act as students.

    This school also runs a vocational spare-time school for workers, twice the size of their own school, for nearby factories, from literacy classes to secondary school. In order to compile a set of textbooks suitable for workers, the school set up a writing group to conduct detailed investigations and research among the workers, to understand the workers' production, learning requirements, and ideological situation, and then mobilized students from various departments to contribute articles as a reference for compiling this set of textbooks. Teachers and students worked hard for several nights and compiled this set of textbooks which are extremely popular with the workers. They also use their rest time to deep-plow the land for the members of nearby people's communes. The surrounding workers and peasants praised: "This school is rooted in our area," and they also sent technical workers and agricultural experts to impart industrial and agricultural technology.

    They have achieved teaching, production, and school management, which is what a new type of communist teachers college should do.

    Now, under the leadership of the Party, the political enthusiasm of the teachers and students of this school is unprecedentedly high. They do not sleep for several nights in a row, and they do not feel tired at all. They carry ore from the mountains to the factory, and even if their backs are bleeding from grinding, they do not complain. When it rains heavily, and the thatched house leaks and they cannot sleep, they spend the whole night singing under wet quilts. Here, the Party Branch Secretary, the President, and the teachers all appear by the furnace as ordinary laborers.

    Now, this school has implemented the new half-work, half-study system. The number of new students enrolling next year will be five times more than the current seven hundred. They plan to run dozens of schools for all the surrounding factories (this is one of the heavy industrial bases of the Luoyang area) and people's communes, forming a new educational system from elementary school to university. They also regard factories and people's communes as their own production bases, and establish factories, workshops, and experimental fields suitable for their own scientific research. The school party organization clearly pointed out that they are an inseparable part of the factories and people's communes. They will complete the four-year courses of the teachers college in one to two years, and are determined to train batches of red teachers who are capable in both literacy and martial arts, both workers and farmers, and have communist consciousness for the Party in a fast, good, and economical way.

    洛阳师院搬到铁矿区炼钢炼人
    又学习　又生产　又办学
    本报讯　记者陈健报道：河南洛阳师范学院9月间迁到新安县铁矿区，又学习，又生产，又办学，炼钢又炼人，树立了教育和生产劳动结合的良好的榜样。
    这所学院在新安县铁矿区的一片野地里，建立了简陋的校舍。又经过一个多月的苦战，目前，已建立了冶炼高炉十三个，土炉二百二十四个，炼焦炉七十个，开采了几百万斤矿石。他们成立了采矿队、爆破队、运输队、冶炼队及化工厂、铁工厂、木工厂等几个专业组织。师生们担起了找矿、开矿、爆破、运输、建炉、冶炼等全套生产，现在他们已经大量生产钢铁，11月的生产任务是一千余吨。
    全校师生大胆革新，彻底改变了过去一套教学学习的方法，在冶炼工地上，以钢为纲，创造了一套活泼的新的教学内容和学习方法。他们的口号是：炉边学习，地头上课，工地即教材。各个系都根据生产需要，编写了一套讲义，并把它列为主要课程。物理系讲冶炼，讲高炉，讲土法炼钢；历史系讲钢铁的出现和钢铁生产在社会发展中的作用和意义；地理系讲黛嵋寨的矿石和河南矿区分布情况及它们的发展远景；化学系讲找矿选矿和爆破；语文系讲作家的人生观，讲炉边、地头和矿山就是创作的源泉等。不到一个月，化学系在爆破现场试验成功了不同性能的十七种炸药，现在外地许多工厂、学校都派人来学习。上百个剧本、舞剧，上万首诗歌快板都在炉边、地头、矿山出现了。他们还在工地举办了小型展览会，展出了高炉的模型和图表、矿石和钢铁的种类及性能等。
    在这所学校里，能者为师，附近工厂、人民公社的劳动模范、新安县的县委书记都是他们的教师；有创造发明的学生也可登台讲授。化学系发明十七种炸药的学生们，就给同系的学生上化学课，教师也在一边听讲当学生。
    这所学校还为附近的工厂开办了一所比他们学校大一倍的、从扫盲班到中学的职工业余学校。为了编写一套适合工人用的教材，学校成立了编写小组，在工人中进行详细的调查研究，了解工人的生产、学习要求、思想情况等，然后发动各系学生投稿，作为编写这套教材的参考。师生们苦战了几个通宵，就编成了这套极受工人欢迎的教材。他们还利用休息时间，为附近人民公社的社员深翻土地。周围工人和农民称赞说：“这所学校扎在咱们这里了”，他们并且派来了技术工人、农业土专家，传授工农业技术。
    一个新型的共产主义的师范学院应该做到的教学、生产、办学，他们都做到了。
    现在，在党的领导下，这所学校的师生政治热情空前高涨，几个通宵不睡，也没有丝毫倦意，把山上的矿石背到工厂，背磨出血，也不叫苦；下大雨时，草屋漏水不能睡，他们就顶着湿被子唱个通宵。在这里，党总支书记、院长、教师也都是以普通劳动者的姿态出现在炉边。
    现在这个学校已经实行了半工半读的新学制。明年入学新生将比现在的七百人多五倍。他们计划为周围所有工厂（这里是洛阳专区重工业基地之一）、人民公社办几十所学校，形成从小学到大学的新的教育体系。他们也以工厂和人民公社作为自己的生产基地，并建立适合自己进行科学研究的工厂、车间和试验田。学校党组织明确指出，他们是工厂、人民公社不能分割的一部分。他们要用一年到两年的时间，读完师范学院四年课程，决心多快好省地为党培养成批的能文能武、亦工亦农有共产主义觉悟的红色教师。（附图片）
