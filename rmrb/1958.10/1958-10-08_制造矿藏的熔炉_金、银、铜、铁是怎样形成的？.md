    The Forge that Creates Mineral Deposits
    ——How are Gold, Silver, Copper, and Iron Formed?

    Magma doesn't get a chance to erupt to the surface very often. More often it is trapped within the Earth's crust, slowly cooling and forming enormous igneous rock masses. The cooling process is lengthy, often taking hundreds or thousands of years.

    Underground magma reservoirs, before they solidify, are like forges. These forges contain a molten mix of various elements. Therefore, after cooling, they not only generate rocks but also produce many types of minerals. Prospectors are always excited when they encounter these deep-earth igneous rock masses.

    Originally, apart from a few elements like oxygen, silicon, and aluminum, the proportion of other elements in the Earth's crust is not large. Someone analyzed and statistically calculated the chemical composition of the Earth's crust within sixteen kilometers underground (calculated by weight percentage). After removing the above three elements, the remaining multiple elements combined are less than 18%. If we further remove iron, calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, and hydrogen, then it's less than 2%. Therefore, if they were evenly distributed throughout the Earth's crust, there wouldn't be many usable minerals. To be utilized, they must be concentrated in certain places, and magma provides excellent conditions for this concentration. Complex chemical changes occur within the magma, generating various useful minerals. When conditions are right, they can accumulate into rich mineral deposits.

    When the magma still has a high temperature of around 1,000 degrees Celsius, many minerals are still in a molten state. The first to solidify are rocks like granite, and some high-temperature-resistant minerals like magnetite, chromite, diamond, and platinum separate from the magma. As the temperature continues to decrease, reaching below 700 degrees, a large amount of the magma's material has solidified into rock. The remaining gases and water vapor become a larger proportion, and the magma's activity increases. The active magma drills haphazardly into the surrounding rock fissures, and undergoes chemical changes with these rocks, solidifying into veins within the fissures. These often contain many important minerals such as crystal, mica, emerald, beryl, fluorite, and several rare metal ores. Crystals and mica minerals formed in this environment often have huge and beautiful crystal formations and are very valuable. Important magnetite and copper deposits can also be generated in the contact zone between the magma and surrounding rocks.

    When the temperature drops to 374 degrees Celsius, water vapor can condense into water. Naturally, this is very hot water, containing a large amount of dissolved minerals. This hot water spreads out along the fissures in the Earth's crust, interacting with the rocks it encounters along the way, and constantly dissipating heat, finally precipitating in the fissures and becoming many important metal veins. The first to precipitate are gold, cassiterite, tungsten ore, pyrite, etc. Then come minerals of metals like silver, copper, lead, zinc, cobalt, and nickel. Finally, minerals like mercury, antimony, and arsenic, as well as barite, calcite, magnesite, etc., are also formed.

    In this way, magma not only creates mineral deposits but also distributes them regularly underground. Upon careful study, these patterns are very complex. In the process of mineral deposit formation, not only does temperature change have an impact, but underground pressure and the nature of the rocks also affect the formation of mineral deposits. Of course, the nature of the magma itself is an even more important factor. Magma is not the same everywhere underground. Some contain a particularly high amount of silicon dioxide, exceeding 65%. We call it acidic magma. Some contain less silicon dioxide, less than 52%, but contain more iron and magnesium. We call it basic or ultrabasic magma. Different magmas generate different minerals. For example, tungsten and molybdenum are easier to find in rocks formed from acidic magma, while chromium, platinum, nickel, and diamonds are related to ultrabasic magma. After comprehensively studying these characteristics, we can grasp the laws of mineral deposit formation and use them to guide prospecting.

    制造矿藏的熔炉
    ——金、银、铜、铁是怎样形成的？
    石工
    岩浆冲出地面的机会毕竟是不多的，更多的时候是在地壳中被囚禁起来，慢慢地冷却，形成巨大的火成岩体。冷却的过程很长，常常需要几百年几千年。
    地下的岩浆库在没有凝结的时候，就像一座座熔炉。炉子里熔有各种各样的元素，因此在冷却后不光是生成岩石，还制出了许多种矿产，找矿的人在碰到这种地下深处生成的火成岩体时，总是很高兴。
    本来，除开氧、矽、铝少数几种元素外，其他元素在地壳中所占比重是不大的。有人就地下十六公里以内的这一部分地壳的化学成分进行分析统计（按重量百分比计算），除掉以上三种元素外，剩下的多种元素合起来不到18％。如果再除去铁、钙、钠、镁、钾、氢几种元素不算，则不到2％。因此如果它们平均分布在地壳内，就没有多少可供利用的矿产了。要利用，必须使它们在某些地方聚集起来，而岩浆正为这种聚集创造了良好的条件。在岩浆里进行着复杂的化学变化，生成了各种有用的矿物，在条件合适的时候，便有可能聚集成为丰富的矿藏。
    当岩浆还有一千度左右的高温时，许多矿物还处于熔融状态。首先凝结出来的是花岗岩之类的岩石，也有一些耐高温的矿物如磁铁矿、铬铁矿、金刚石、铂等从岩浆中分离出来；温度继续降低，到了七百度以下时，岩浆中的大量物质已凝成岩石了，剩下的气体、水汽所占分量就变得很大，岩浆的活动性也增强了。活动的岩浆向四周包围它的岩石的裂缝中乱钻，并且和这些岩石发生化学变化，在裂缝里凝结成一道道的岩脉。其中常有许多重要的矿产如水晶、云母、绿宝石、绿柱石、莹石以及若干稀有金属矿。在这种环境下生成的水晶、云母等矿物，常有巨大美丽的结晶体，很有价值。在岩浆与周围岩石的接触地带中，还能生成重要的磁铁矿以及铜矿。
    温度降低到三百七十四度时，水汽已经能够凝结成水了。自然，这是很热的水，里面溶有大量的矿物质。这些热水沿着地壳中的裂缝四散分布，沿途与遇到的岩石发生作用，同时不断散失着热，终于在裂缝中沉淀出来，成为许多重要的金属矿脉。最先沉淀出来的有黄金、锡石、钨矿、黄铁矿等。接着跑出来的有银、铜、铅、锌、钴、镍等金属的矿物，最后，汞、锑、砷等矿产以及重晶石、方解石、菱镁矿等也都形成了。
    就这样，岩浆不仅造成了矿藏，而且使它们有规律地在地下分布着。仔细研究起来，这些规律是很复杂的，在矿藏的形成过程中，不仅温度的变化会发生影响，地下的压力以及岩石的性质也对矿藏的生成发生作用。当然，岩浆本身的性质更是一个重要的因素。在地下各处的岩浆，并不都是相同的。有的含二氧化矽特别多，超过了65％我们叫它酸性岩浆；有的含二氧化矽较少不到52％，可是含铁、镁较多，我们叫它基性或超基性岩浆。不同的岩浆生成的矿物也有差异，如钨、钼在酸性岩浆凝成的岩石中较易找到，而铬、铂、镍、金刚石等则与超基性岩浆有关。在综合研究了这些特点以后，我们就可以掌握矿藏生成的规律并用来指导找矿了。
