    Seizing Advanced Building Technology
    Large-Span Prestressed Reinforced Concrete Trusses Successfully Made
    (Our Newspaper) News: China's largest span (sixty meters) prestressed reinforced concrete truss has been successfully trial-produced at the Beijing Second Construction Company's component factory. After strict quality inspection, it has been proven to fully meet design requirements. This is a new achievement in China's advanced building technology. This type of truss can save a large amount of steel; compared with steel beams of the same span, it can save about three-quarters of the steel. The successful trial production of this truss has opened up avenues for the use of prestressed reinforced concrete components in large-span buildings.
    This truss was designed with the assistance of the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Fourth Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building. During the trial production process, it received assistance from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Soviet experts. Cherish every ton of transportation capacity

    攻取建筑尖端技术
    大跨度预应力钢筋混凝土屋架制成
    本报讯　我国最大跨度（六十公尺）的预应力钢筋混凝土屋架，已在北京市第二建筑公司构件厂试制成功。经过严格的质量检验，证明完全合乎设计要求。这是我国在建筑尖端技术上的新成就。这种屋架可以节约大量钢材，和同样跨度的钢梁比较，可以节省四分之三左右的钢材。这个屋架的试制成功为在大跨度建筑上使用预应力钢筋混凝土构件开辟了道路。
    这个屋架是建筑工程部建筑科学研究院协助，第一机械工业部第四设计院设计的。在试制过程中，曾得到中国科学院和苏联专家的帮助。珍惜每一吨运输力量
