Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, October 23rd: Ningxia is now in a great historical period of all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

　　At present, industry is blooming everywhere in the region, with more than 9,500 factories and mines of all sizes being built. From plains to mountains, from cities to villages, a basic industrial system is taking shape. In agriculture, summer and autumn crops have achieved a bumper harvest this year, with a total output of more than 2.7 billion jin, an increase of more than double compared to last year. Calculated by the region's population, the average person has 1,500 jin of grain.

　　Since last winter and spring, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia have implemented the general line of socialist construction, criticized the "theory of backwardness," the "theory of industrial mystery," and the "theory of special circumstances," greatly liberating their minds and setting off a high tide of all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Ningxia had a relatively weak industrial base. By 1957, a total of 66 factories and mines had been established. However, in the past six months or so this year, the Hui and Han people have been vigorously developing various industries such as steel, electricity, fuel, machine manufacturing, agricultural tool repair, and textiles. An average of 44 factories have been put into production every day.

　　Since the opening of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, industrial construction in Ningxia has entered a new stage. With the support of all parts of the country, more than ten large-scale industries, including steel, flax, sugar factories, and coal mines, have begun construction in the region, and ninety large factories are actively preparing. Shizuishan, the newly built industrial city of the autonomous region, is being accelerated into a coal base in Northwest China. The Qingtongxia Water Conservancy Project on the Yellow River, which irrigates 10 million mu and generates 260,000 kilowatts of electricity, started construction not long ago and has now entered the winter construction phase. In addition, large-scale oil exploration in the Ordos platform area within the autonomous region is also being actively carried out, and it will become a new large oil field in China.

　　Since the banner of the whole people refining steel and iron was raised, more than 100,000 Hui and Han workers and commune members have rushed to the steel front to fight for the production of 30,000 tons of iron, 10,000 tons of steel, and 1,000 tons of copper this year.

　　Ningxia's agricultural production and construction are progressing by leaps and bounds. Since last winter, the people of all ethnic groups have been working with soaring enthusiasm to build large-scale drainage and irrigation canals in the plains and to divert water to the mountains in the mountainous areas, turning arid mountainous areas into irrigated land. In less than a year, the area of irrigated land in the region has expanded by more than 1.53 million mu. The Ningxia Plain in the Yellow River irrigation area, although it has a long history of irrigation, suffered from disrepair of canals before liberation, and soil salinization became increasingly serious. Many fertile fields were turned into lakes and alkaline land, forming the famous "Seventy-Two Connected Lakes" disaster on both sides of the Yellow River. In the years since liberation, especially in the high tide of water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the Hui and Han people have renovated and built dozens of large and small rivers and drainage canals, as well as tens of thousands of branch canals, so that the irrigation area has basically formed a relatively complete drainage and irrigation network, and the area of irrigated land has expanded to more than 3.8 million mu. In addition, with the improvement of the irrigation system, soil salinization has been greatly reduced.

　　Due to the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken by the people of all ethnic groups and the adoption of various other production-increasing measures, the total grain output of the region this year has doubled compared to last year. Before liberation, the average per-mu yield of grain on the Ningxia Yellow River Plain was about 150 jin. After liberation, production has increased almost every year. This year, the average per-mu yield of more than 1 million mu of spring wheat on the plain reached 516 jin, an increase of 72% compared to last year. After the increase in wheat production, the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia won a bumper harvest of rice.

    工业建设遍地开花　农业生产突飞猛进
    宁夏进入全面跃进的伟大时期
    新华社银川23日电　宁夏地区工农业生产正处在全面大跃进的伟大历史时期。
    目前，全区的工业遍地开花，已经兴建起大小厂矿九千五百多个。从平原到山区，从城市到乡村，一个基础工业的体系正在形成。农业方面今年夏秋作物获得大丰收，总产量达二十七亿多斤，比去年跃增了一倍以上。按全区人口计算，平均每人有一千五百斤粮食。
    去冬今春以来，宁夏各族人民在各级党委的领导下，贯彻社会主义建设总路线，批判了“落后论”、“工业神秘论”和“特殊论”，思想大解放，掀起了工农业生产全面跃进的高潮，宁夏地区工业基础相当薄弱，到1957年共建立了六十六个厂矿，而在今年半年多来，回、汉族人民大办钢铁、电力、燃料、机器制造、农具修配、纺织等各种工业，平均每天有四十四个工厂投入生产。
    包兰铁路通车以后，宁夏地区工业建设更进入了一个新的阶段。在全国各地的支援下，全区已有钢铁、亚麻、糖厂、煤矿等十多项较大的工业开始兴建，并有九十个大工厂在积极筹备。自治区新建的工业城市石咀山，正在加速建设成为我国西北煤炭基地。灌溉面积达一千万亩、发电量达二十六万瓩的黄河青铜峡水利枢纽工程，在不久以前开工，现在进入了冬季施工阶段。此外，在自治区境内鄂尔多斯地台地区大规模的石油勘探工作，也正在积极进行，它将成为我国的一个新的大油田。
    全民炼钢炼铁的帅旗升起以后，全区已经有十多万回、汉族工人和公社社员齐赴钢铁战线，为今年生产三万吨铁、一万吨钢、一千吨铜而战斗。
    宁夏农业生产建设更是突飞猛进。从去年冬天以来，各族人民以冲天干劲在川区兴修大型排灌渠道，在山区引水上山，变干旱山区为水地。这样不到一年，全区水地面积就扩大了一百五十三万多亩。引黄灌区的宁夏平原，过去虽有悠久的灌溉历史，但解放前渠道失修，土壤盐渍化日益严重，有很多良田变成湖洼碱地，形成黄河两岸著名的“七十二连湖”灾害。解放几年来，特别是去冬今春兴修水利高潮中，回、汉族人民整修和兴修了几十道大小河道和排水干沟以及数万条的支毛沟，使灌区基本上形成了一个比较完整的排灌网，水地面积扩大到三百八十多万亩，再加上改进灌水制度，土壤盐渍化大大减轻。
    由于各族人民大兴水利和采取其他各种增产措施，今年全区粮食总产量比去年翻了一番。解放前，宁夏黄河平原粮食平均亩产一百五十斤左右，解放以后几乎年年增产，今年平原上一百余万亩春小麦平均亩产达到五百一十六斤，比去年增产72％。在小麦增产之后，宁夏各族人民又争得了水稻大丰收。
