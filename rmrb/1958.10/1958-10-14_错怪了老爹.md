	Wrongly Blaming Old Man

	It was getting dark. I strode towards Old Man Wang's house in the South Suburb Commune, feeling anxious.

	I was late for a reason: tonight, they were showing the film "Song Shijie," which I had been eagerly looking forward to seeing for a long time. But I had to go to Old Man Wang's house for literacy tutoring; this was a crash course, and in four more days, the old man could graduate. What to do? While I was engaged in a fierce ideological struggle with myself, the old man's indescribable eagerness to learn suddenly appeared before my eyes. I immediately decided: abandon the movie and go to the old man!

	But it was already late! I knew he must be holding his literacy textbook, anxiously waiting for me. But, strangely, why wasn't his house lit up at this hour? Getting closer, I saw that the iron general (padlock) was guarding the door. Where had he gone? Hey, he must have gone to see "Song Shijie" too. My anger was no small matter; I shouted, "Unreasonable!"

	I walked back in a fit of anger. While passing through the rice fields, I suddenly heard a familiar and friendly greeting: "Teacher Wei!" Surprised, I realized that Old Man Wang was standing in the moonlight. He wore an apologetic look and said, "You went to my house, right? I'm really sorry. I really couldn't make it tonight, so I asked my grandson to run and ask you for leave. Didn't you meet him? That kid must have gone off to play; this, this, really..." My face flushed, and I quickly said, "It's nothing, nothing." He spent the day spraying pesticide to eliminate rice leaf rollers and cotton red spiders, and at night, he lit a rice stem borer lamp to lure and kill rice stem borers. And I, just for giving up a movie, thought my sacrifice was greater than the sky, and judged a gentleman's heart with the mind of a petty person. At this thought, I couldn't help but loudly tell him, "It's alright, I'll make it up to you during my lunch break tomorrow."

    错怪了老爹
    天黑下来了。我拽开大步向南郊社王老爹家走去，心里直着急。
    我来迟了，有个原因：今晚放映电影“宋士杰”，这是我久已盼望要看的了。但是我得去王老爹家扫盲，这是突击任务，再有四天，老爹就可以毕业。怎么办呢？我在进行激烈的自我思想斗争的时候，老爹那难以形容的渴求学习的热情的模样，忽然如在眼前。我立时决定：放弃电影，走向老爹！
    然而已经迟了！我知道，他老人家一定捧着识字课本在焦急地等着我了。可是，奇怪，他屋里此刻为什么不点灯？走近一看，原来铁将军把了门。人上哪里去了呢？嘿，一定也去看“宋士杰”了。我这一气，非同小可，嘴里连喊：“岂有此理？”
    我气急败坏地往回走。穿过稻田时，忽然听到一声熟悉而亲切的招呼：“魏老师！”我一惊，才发现月光之下站的就是老爹。他露出一脸抱歉的神色说道：“你到我家去了吧？真对不起你。今晚我实在没空，叫孙子快跑向你请假。你没遇见吗？这孩子一定贪玩去了，这，这，真是……”我脸一红连忙说“没什么，没什么”。他白天喷药突击消灭稻苞虫和棉花红蜘蛛，夜晚点起盏螟蛾灯，诱杀螟蛾。而我，只不过放弃一场电影，就自以为牺牲大于天，还以小人之心度君子之腹。一念及此。我不由得大声告诉他道：“没有事，明天午睡时间，我抽你的空替你补上吧。”
