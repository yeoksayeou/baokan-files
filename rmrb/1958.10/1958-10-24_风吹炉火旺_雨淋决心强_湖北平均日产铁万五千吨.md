Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 23rd: Hubei Province's four million iron and steel army overcame the "wind and rain barrier," achieving an average daily pig iron production of 15,386 tons from October 15th to 21st. In these seven days, the province's daily pig iron production exceeded 10,000 tons for five days, reaching a peak of 32,280 tons on the 20th.

Since mid-October, Hubei Province has experienced continuous wind and rain, creating numerous difficulties for iron and steel production. However, the steel warriors' determination outweighed the wind and rain. They proposed the battle cry: "Wind blows and furnace fire burns stronger, rain soaks but determination stays strong, wage war against wind and rain, and ensure a bumper harvest of steel!" Steel warriors at all construction sites raced against the wind and rain to repair work sheds, furnace sheds, and raw material sheds, even using quilts and cotton clothing to combat the wind and rain, ensuring the normal operation of blast furnaces. The vast number of cadres and the masses in the rear actively provided support.

After Hubei Province launched its first "satellite" with a daily pig iron production of over 16,000 tons on September 29th, in order to combine the blitz production of launching "satellites" with regular high-yield production, various regions widely carried out furnace-front rectification campaigns centered on high yield and longevity, improved production management, and significantly increased work efficiency. To ensure the supply of fuel needed for blast furnaces, the province produced more than 760,000 tons of raw coal during the high-yield week, exceeding last year's total output by more than 40,000 tons, with five counties producing over 10,000 tons. Chongyang County, due to the adoption of open-pit mining by opening mountains and uncovering tops, reached a peak of 300,000 tons on the 20th.

Hubei Province's steel production also made some progress during the high-yield week, with an average daily output of 1,665 tons, an increase of more than 50% compared to September. Through the high-yield week, the province has built more than 5,000 native steelmaking furnaces, stir-frying furnaces, and more than 100 converters, enhancing steelmaking capacity and laying the foundation for further development of the mass steelmaking movement.

In order to ensure the completion of steel production tasks, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference of prefectural and county party committee secretaries on the 20th, requiring the province to launch a province-wide steelmaking high tide in November, striving for a double bumper harvest of iron and steel.

    风吹炉火旺　雨淋决心强
    湖北平均日产铁万五千吨
    新华社武汉23日电　湖北省四百万钢铁大军大破“风雨关”，在15日到21日，使生铁的平均日产量达到一万五千三百八十六吨。全省在这七天中，有五天的生铁日产量超过了一万吨，20日曾达到三万二千二百八十吨的高峰。
    10月中旬以来，湖北省各地连日风雨交加，给钢铁生产带来不少困难。但是，风大雨大没有钢铁战士的决心大，他们提出：“风吹炉火旺，雨淋决心强，向风雨开战，保钢铁丰收”的战斗口号。各工地的钢铁战士都在风雨中抢修工棚、炉棚、原材料棚，甚至把被子、棉衣拿出来和风雨作战，保证高炉的正常生产。后方的广大干部和群众，也积极支援。
    湖北省从9月29日放出第一颗日产生铁一万六千多吨的卫星以后，为了使突击生产放卫星和经常性的高额丰产结合起来，各地普遍开展了以高产长寿为中心的炉前整风运动，改进了生产管理，显著地提高了工效。为了保证供应高炉所需的燃料，在高产周中全省共生产了七十六万多吨原煤，超过去年全年产量四万多吨，出现了五个万吨县，其中崇阳县由于采取开山揭顶的露天开采，20日曾达到三十万吨高峰。
    湖北省钢的生产，在高产周中也有一定进展，平均日产量达到一千六百六十五吨，比9月份增长了50％多。通过高产周，全省已建起了五千多个土炼钢炉、炒钢炉和一百多个转炉，增强了炼钢能力，为进一步开展群众性炼钢运动打下了基础。
    为了保证完成钢的生产任务，中共湖北省委在20日又召开了地委、县委书记的电话会议，要求全省在11月份掀起一个全民性的炼钢高潮，力争钢铁双丰收。
