Rapidly Cultivate 200 Million Mu of Fast-Growing, High-Yielding Timber Forests
	Timber Shortages Will Turn into Surpluses Within Ten Years
	(Report from our newspaper) The National On-Site Conference on High-Yielding Forestry, convened by the Ministry of Forestry, successfully concluded on September 30 in Jinping County, Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province. Through on-the-ground investigation and research, the participating representatives greatly liberated their thinking, shattered the outdated notion that trees are slow-growing organisms, and decided to launch a rapid high-yield forestry movement while carrying out a national tree-planting campaign to accelerate the transformation of the nation's natural landscape and support national construction.
	China's existing forests have only 6 billion cubic meters of timber reserves, far from meeting the needs of the rapid development of various socialist constructions. However, if the country rapidly develops 200 million mu of fast-growing, high-yield forests, producing 50 to 100 cubic meters of timber per mu, then in ten years, timber production can increase by 10 billion to 17 billion cubic meters, increasing the nation's current timber reserves by one to two times. At that time, China can transform from a country with a timber shortage to a country with a timber surplus.
	According to the planning suggestions of the representatives from the eighteen provinces and cities participating in the meeting (mainly from the provinces south of the Yangtze River), the meeting formulated a preliminary plan for the rapid high-yield production of trees, oil-tea, and moso bamboo across the country. (1) Regarding trees, the plan requires the creation of over 190 million mu of fast-growing, high-yield forests, mainly of Chinese fir, during the Second Five-Year Plan. These forests will mature in about ten years, with an annual output of about 1 billion cubic meters of timber, creating 60 billion yuan of wealth for the nation each year. (2) Regarding oil-tea, the plan requires that by 1959, existing forests across the country will produce an average of 30 to 40 jin of oil per mu, more than double this year's estimated output, with a total output of 1.1 million to 1.5 million dan. By 1962, the goal is to produce an average of 100 to 150 jin of oil per mu, with a total output of 3.5 million to 5.3 million dan. At that time, combined with the over 13 million mu of young forests planted during the First Five-Year Plan entering production, the total output of oil-tea will reach 3.6 million dan, accounting for about one-quarter of the nation's total edible oil needs of 200 million dan. (3) Regarding moso bamboo, the plan requires all provinces to basically complete the land reclamation of moso bamboo mountains by this winter and next spring or next winter, and to carry out year-round tending and fertilization work, earnestly protecting spring shoots and rationally harvesting and utilizing the bamboo, retaining an appropriate amount of mother bamboo. The goal is to achieve a total national moso bamboo reserve of over 3.5 billion dan by 1962 from the existing 17.7 million mu of moso bamboo forests. While actively reclaiming and developing moso bamboo production, we should also actively develop the production of other types of bamboo with wider uses.
	The meeting pointed out that in order to widely and deeply promote the rapid high-yield forestry movement, all localities must earnestly adopt the following organizational measures: Party committees should strengthen leadership, with secretaries taking charge, mobilizing the entire people, pooling collective wisdom and effort; organizing visits and comparisons, launching red banner competitions; carrying out mountain-top debates to resolve ideological problems among the masses; carrying out technological and cultural revolutions; implementing the establishment of forest farms universally by people's communes; forestry administrative leaders and enterprises at all levels should universally cultivate rapid high-yield experimental forests, and release "satellites" of rapid high-yield forestry. In addition, regarding the basic technical measures to promote the rapid high-yield production of the three tree species, Chinese fir, oil-tea, and moso bamboo, the meeting pointed out four points: meticulously deep plowing and preparing the land, meticulously reclaiming (referring to oil-tea and moso bamboo); carefully selecting superior varieties and cultivating strong seedlings; meticulously tending, continuously applying large amounts of fertilizer; and implementing close planting.

    迅速培植两亿亩快速丰产林木
    十年内木材不足变有余
    本报讯　林业部召开的全国林木丰产现场会议，于9月30日在贵州省黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏县胜利闭幕。会议通过实地调查研究，与会代表大大解放了思想，打破了林木是迟缓生物的陈腐观念，决定在开展全民植树造林运动的同时，开展林木快速丰产运动，加速改变祖国的自然面貌，支援国家建设。
    我国现有森林的木材蓄积量只有六十亿立方公尺，远远不能满足各项社会主义建设飞跃发展的需要。但是，如果全国迅速搞两亿亩的快速丰产林，每亩生产木材五十到一百立方公尺，那么在十年后就可增加木材一百到一百七十亿立方公尺，比全国现在木材蓄积量增加一倍至两倍左右，那时我国就可由木材不足变成木材有余的国家。
    根据与会的十八省市（以江南各省为主）代表的规划意见，会议制定了全国树木、油茶、毛竹快速丰产的初步规划。（1）关于树木，规划要求在第二个五年计划期间，营造以杉树为主的快速丰产林一亿九千多万亩，生长十年左右成材，每年出材量可达十亿立方公尺左右，每年可给国家创造六百亿元的财富。（2）关于油茶，规划要求全国现有成林，到1959年平均每亩产油三十到四十市斤，比今年估产增加一倍多，总产量达一千一百到一千五百万担。到1962年要求平均每亩产油一百到一百五十斤，总产量达三千五百到五千三百万担。那时，再加上第一个五年计划期间新造的一千三百多万亩幼林投入生产，油茶总产量将达三千六百万担，约占全国人民食油总需要量两亿担的四分之一。（3）关于毛竹，规划要求各省在今冬明春或明冬，基本上把毛竹山垦复完毕，并进行常年的抚育和施肥工作，切实作到保护春笋和合理采伐利用，保留适量的母竹，争取现有一千七百七十万亩毛竹林到1962年全国毛竹总蓄积量达到三十五亿担以上。在积极垦复和发展毛竹生产的同时，并积极发展其他用途较广的竹类生产。
    会议指出，为了广泛深入的开展林木快速丰产运动，各地必须认真采取以下组织措施：党委加强领导，书记挂帅，全民动员，群策群力；组织参观评比，开展红旗竞赛；开展山头鸣放辩论，解决群众思想问题；开展技术革命和文化革命；实行人民公社普遍办林场；各级林业行政领导和企业单位，普遍培植快速丰产试验林，放林木快速丰产“卫星”。此外，关于促使杉树、油茶和毛竹三个树种快速丰产的基本技术措施，会议指出有四条：细致地深翻和整理土地，细致地垦复（指油茶、毛竹）；精选良种，培育壮苗；细致地抚育，连续大量施肥；实行密植。
