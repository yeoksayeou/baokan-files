Xinhua News Agency, October 14th dispatch from New York via TASS: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee continued its discussion today on three agenda items related to disarmament.

	Speaking first at the morning session was Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David. He emphasized the need for an immediate, unconditional, and permanent cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. He condemned the United States' position obstructing a nuclear test ban.

	The Mexican representative pointed out that the issue of halting nuclear weapon testing is of particular significance because these tests pose a special danger to residents worldwide. The Mexican representative advocated for a meeting of representatives from major nuclear weapon-possessing nations in New York in the near future to hold negotiations on the issue of halting nuclear testing.

	U.S. Representative Lodge, on behalf of the United States and sixteen other countries aligned with the U.S. in various military blocs and alliances, submitted a proposal.

	The purpose of the American proposal is primarily to prevent the General Assembly from issuing a call for an immediate and unconditional cessation of nuclear weapon testing. The American proposal subtly replaces the immediate and unconditional cessation of nuclear testing with a suggestion for a temporary halt to such tests during future Geneva negotiations.

	The American proposal also suggests holding some so-called non-political technical expert meetings to study other disarmament issues, attempting to mislead world opinion with such suggestions. In reality, it can only delay the resolution of this important issue, because the experts' task is only to study the issues, not to sign practical agreements on them.

	Swedish Foreign Minister Unden, who spoke last at the morning session, emphasized the importance of halting nuclear weapon testing. He said that the General Assembly should call on all countries to cease nuclear weapon testing. The Swedish representative believes that the one-year period proposed by the United States and Britain for stopping nuclear weapon testing is "unreasonably short."

Xinhua News Agency, October 14th dispatch from New York via TASS: Soviet Representative Zorin spoke at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee afternoon session on October 13th.

	He explained the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military budgets of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France by 10% to 15%, and criticized the American proposal regarding the issue of nuclear weapon testing.

	Zorin emphasized the harm of the arms race. He said that since 1955, the Soviet Union has unilaterally reduced military expenditures by 15.8 billion rubles, while simultaneously reducing the number of armed forces by more than 2 million people.

	Zorin stressed that the American proposal on disarmament issues, presented by U.S. Representative Lodge on behalf of several delegations, lacks the main content – the demand that major nations conducting nuclear weapon tests immediately and unconditionally cease such tests. The proposal merely expresses a vague hope for a temporary cessation of such tests. Zorin went on to say that this formulation itself reveals that the drafters of the American proposal plan only to halt testing for a certain period, rather than permanently ceasing testing as demanded by the people of all countries around the world. From the American proposal, it can be seen that its drafters oppose the immediate and unconditional cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, attempting to have the United Nations General Assembly only pass a hollow and meaningless proposal that cannot bind anyone or solve any problems. Moreover, the American proposal also includes clauses that would allow Western countries to continue conducting nuclear weapon tests in the future. Zorin pointed out that if the Geneva negotiations on the issue of halting nuclear weapon testing become deadlocked or suspended due to the Western countries' unwillingness to reach an agreement, the Western countries would continue to conduct nuclear weapon tests.

	Zorin continued by saying that the United States and other Western countries are clearly trying to shift the entire discussion of disarmament issues in the United Nations General Assembly from a political level to a technical level, that is, to replace the substantive discussion of disarmament issues with a discussion of technical supervision issues. The purpose of doing this is to reduce everything to a discussion of the technical aspects of supervising the implementation of those measures that are impossible to achieve or for which no agreement has even been reached. Zorin emphasized that the United States and Britain are attempting to push the United Nations onto a path of endless meetings of technical experts, which is, in effect, an attempt to evade the resolution of disarmament issues and mislead public opinion.

    联大政委会继续辩论裁军问题
    苏捷代表斥美国阻挠停止核试验
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：联合国大会政治委员会今天继续讨论三项有关裁军问题的议程。
    上午会议上第一个发言的是捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维。他强调指出，必须立即无条件地永远停止试验原子武器和氢武器。他谴责美国阻挠停止核试验的立场。
    墨西哥代表指出，停止试验核武器问题具有特殊意义，因为这些试验对于全世界的居民都有特殊的危险。墨西哥代表主张最近在纽约召开拥有核武器的各大国代表会议，就停止核试验问题举行谈判。
    美国代表洛奇用美国和其他同美国纠集在各种不同的军事集团和同盟之内的十六个国家的名义，提出一项提案。
    美国提案的目的首先就是不允许大会提出立即无条件停止试验核武器的号召。美国的提案把立即无条件停止核试验偷偷地换成为在未来日内瓦谈判期间暂时停止一下这类试验的建议。
    美国提案还建议举行一些所谓非政治性的技术专家会议来研究其他裁军问题，企图用这样的建议来迷惑世界舆论。实际上它只能使这个重要问题迟迟不得解决。因为专家们的任务只是研究问题，而不是就这些问题签订实际协定。
    上午会议最后发言的瑞典外交大臣恩顿着重指出停止核武器试验的重要性。他说，大会应当呼吁所有国家停止试验核武器。瑞典代表认为，美国和英国提出停止核武器试验一年，这个时期“短得不合情理”。
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：苏联代表佐林在联合国大会政治委员会13日下午会议上发言。
    他说明了苏联提出的削减苏、美、英、法四国军事预算10％至15％的建议，并且批评了美国关于试验核武器问题的提案。
    佐林强调指出了军备竞赛的害处。他说，苏联从1955年以来单方面削减了军事开支一百五十八亿卢布，同时把武装部队的人数裁减了二百多万人。
    佐林强调指出，美国代表洛奇以一些国家的代表团的名义提出的美国的关于裁军问题的提案中没有主要内容——要求进行核武器试验的大国立即无条件地停止这种试验。提案中只是空泛地希望暂时停止这种试验。佐林接着说，这种提法本身就已经揭露出：美国提案的起草人的计划仅限于在某段时期以内停止试验，而不是像全世界各国人民所要求的那样永远停止试验。从美国的提案中可以看出，它的起草人反对立即无条件地停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，企图使联合国大会只通过一个空洞的、毫无内容的提案，这项提案不能约束任何人，不能解决任何问题。而且，美国提案还包括一些允许西方国家将来继续进行核武器试验的条文。佐林指出，如果就停止核武器试验问题举行的日内瓦谈判由于西方国家本身不愿意达成协议而陷于僵局或者中止，西方国家就要继续进行核武器试验。
    佐林接着说，美国和其他西方国家显然是要把联合国大会关于裁军问题的全盘讨论从政治上转移到技术上去，也就是要用对技术监督问题的讨论来代替对裁军问题实质的讨论。这样做的目的是要把一切都归结为讨论对那些无法实现的、甚至没有达成任何协议的措施的实现进行监督的技术。佐林强调说，美英两国企图把联合国推上技术专家无休止地开会的道路上去，这实际上是企图逃避裁军问题的解决和迷惑舆论。
