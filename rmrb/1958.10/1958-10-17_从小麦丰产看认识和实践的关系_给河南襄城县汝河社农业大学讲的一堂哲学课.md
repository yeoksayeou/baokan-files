    Seeing the Relationship Between Knowledge and Practice from Wheat Bumper Harvests
    —A Philosophy Lesson Given to the Ruhe Commune Agricultural University in Xiangcheng County, Henan
    Li Zhe
    “Knowledge originates from practice,” this is one of many philosophical truths. To explain this truth, I will start with eating melons. In our Ruhe Commune area, people used to grow melons, and everyone, adults and children, knows that melons taste sweet. If you ask: How do you know that melons taste sweet? Everyone will say: "I've eaten them." That's right, it's because you've eaten them that you know melons taste sweet. This means that to know the taste of a melon, you must first eat it. "Knowing the taste of a melon" is called "knowledge"; "eating it" is "practice." This is the principle of "knowledge originates from practice."
    Some people may object: "People who have never eaten melons also know that melons are sweet." We say that if someone who has never eaten a melon says it's sweet, then they either asked someone who has eaten it, or they saw it in a book. However, it is certain that the "sweetness" they heard or saw in a book will not be exactly the same as the real sweetness of a melon. This not only illustrates the principle of "knowledge originates from practice," but also illustrates that "only practice leads to true knowledge."
    Practice is not only the source of knowledge, but also the criterion for judging truth. Here, I will give another example about melons. It is said that in one place, the older generations had never grown watermelons. One year they planted one mu. When the watermelons grew, some people said the melons were ripe, and some said they were not ripe, and they argued endlessly. They had also heard others say that when a melon is ripe, it is large, has a shiny skin, dry tendrils, black or dark brown seeds, and the flesh is sweet and not sour, …. However, because they had never grown melons before, no one could be sure whether the melons were ripe just by looking at their appearance. As a result of the dispute, someone suggested: Let's cut one open and taste it. When they cut it open, the seeds were half white, and the kernels were not yet hard; when they tasted the flesh, it was hard and sour. At this time, everyone agreed: the melons were not yet ripe. This shows that only through the practice of cutting open the melon and tasting it can one accurately judge whether the melon is truly ripe or falsely ripe, and whose opinion is the truth. Speaking of this, some people may say: "That old melon farmer, he knows whether a melon is ripe just by looking at it or tapping it!" Yes! The reason why the old melon farmer knows it at a glance or a tap is actually no great secret. It's just that he has cut open more melons, tasted more, looked at more, and tapped more. In other words, he has practiced more, and he has explored and summarized a set of principles for judging whether a melon is ripe from his long-term melon planting practice.
    After we have initially clarified this principle, let's study the wheat production experience. This year, our area has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of wheat. We are confident of achieving even greater harvests next year. This is because, through the practice of this year's wheat bumper harvest, we have a more systematic and profound understanding of how to strive for a wheat bumper harvest. This understanding is concentrated in the "Five Reforms" proposed by the county party committee and the county people's committee in the "1959 Wheat Leap Forward Plan": ① Change shallow plowing to deep plowing; ② Change little fertilization to more fertilization; ③ Change dry land to irrigated land; ④ Change inferior varieties to improved varieties; ⑤ Change sparse planting to dense planting. We can imagine that if there had been no practice of the people of the whole county working hard under the leadership of the Party to engage in wheat production last winter and this spring, the experience of the "Five Reforms" would not have been summarized. Of course, the "Five Reforms" experience was not only obtained in a few months last winter and this spring in our county, but also the result of the accumulation of experience in wheat production by the working farmers of the country for thousands of years, and also the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the full play of the enthusiasm of the masses. In the past, working farmers had this saying about wheat production experience: "There is no bad land," "Diligent people don't have lazy land," "If you don't apply fertilizer to the land, it's like messing around," "Wheat harvest needs eight, ten, three rains," "Sparse wheat and dense beans will kill you," "Good seeds bear good fruit" …. These are all experiences summarized by working farmers in their personal practice of wheat production for thousands of years. Naturally, some of these experiences have one-sidedness and backwardness, such as the sentence "Wheat harvest needs eight, ten, three rains," which reflects the backward idea of ​​relying solely on heaven. After liberation, the Party led us to engage in production, and after several years of hard work, especially after the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring, the experience summarized by predecessors in production practice has been further enriched, improved, and perfected. The "Five Reforms" experience of wheat bumper harvest that we are talking about now is summarized from continuous wheat production practice and continuous improvement of understanding. All in all, the principle is the same: Without people's production practice, no good experience can be obtained!
    With the continuous deepening of people's practical activities, people's understanding must also be continuously deepened and improved; people's improved understanding can better guide their practical activities. If practice develops, and people do not earnestly summarize new practical experience, and still stay at the old level of understanding, then it is impossible to guide their practical activities to continue to develop, which will make their understanding stagnate, their thinking backward, and unable to keep up with the times. Take the issue of wheat bumper harvest as an example. When planting wheat last year, some people couldn't understand the advanced measures such as deep plowing, more fertilization, sufficient watering, and improved varieties and dense planting. Although they also understood some old experiences and old principles of planting wheat, because of their conservative thinking, they did not summarize new experiences, so they did not dare to move forward on the basis of old experiences. They believed that: "Deep plowing is okay, but there is no need to plow seven or eight inches deep," "We need to apply more fertilizer, but we can't get more than 10,000 jin per mu," "Wheat needs water, but one winter of rain and snow is enough, there is no need for people to water," "Dense planting is okay, but sowing 20 or 30 jin of seeds per mu is messing around" …. In short, in the eyes of these people, "old experience is enough," and new ones are unnecessary. Because of this conservative thinking, very naturally, they also do not believe that wheat can continue to leap forward in production. The fact of this year's wheat bumper harvest tells us that the old experiences and old understandings of these people are backward. The potential of agricultural production is endless. As long as people continue to summarize new experiences from practice and continue to improve their understanding, they can continuously advance agricultural production.

    从小麦丰产看认识和实践的关系
    ——给河南襄城县汝河社农业大学讲的一堂哲学课
    李哲
    “认识来源于实践”，这是许多哲学道理中的一个。为了说明这个道理，我先从吃瓜说起。我们汝河社这一带，以前好种瓜，无论是大人、小孩都知道瓜的味道是甜的。如果问：为什么知道瓜的味道是甜的呢？大家一定会说：“吃过”。对了，就是因为吃过，所以才知道瓜的味道是甜的。这就是说，要想知瓜味，先要吃一吃。“知瓜味”，这就叫做“认识”；“吃一吃”就是“实践”。这就是“认识来源于实践”这个道理。
    可能有人会反驳：“没吃过瓜的人也知道瓜是甜的”。我们说，没有吃过瓜的说瓜甜，那如果不是问了问人家吃过瓜的，就是从书本上见到过。但是，可以肯定，他所听到的或在书本上见到的“甜味”，和瓜的真甜味不会完全一样。从这里，不但说明了“认识来源于实践”这个道理，同时还说明了“唯有实践才能真知”。
    实践不但是认识的来源，而且也是判断真理的标准。这里，再举一个关于瓜的例子。据说，有一个地方，老辈子就没有种过西瓜，那一年他们种了一亩，西瓜长大了，有些人说瓜熟啦，有些人说瓜没熟，争论不休。他们也听别人说过，瓜熟了，就个儿大、皮光、须干、籽是黑色的或黧色的、瓤是甜的不是酸的，……。但是，因为过去没种过瓜，单从外表看，谁也不能确定瓜熟不熟。争论的结果，有人提议：剖开看看尝尝。剖开一看，籽是半截白，仁还不硬；尝了尝瓤，又硬又酸。这时，大家才一致认为：瓜还没熟。这就说明，只有通过剖开瓜来尝一尝这个实践，才能确切地判断瓜是真熟还是假熟，谁的意见是真理。说到这里，也可能有人会说：“那老瓜匠，人家一看就知或用手一弹便知瓜熟不熟！”对！老瓜匠所以一看就知、一弹便知，实际上并没有什么了不起的秘诀，不过是因为他剖开得多了，尝得多了，看得多了，弹得多了，也就是说，他实践得多了，他已经从长期的种瓜实践中摸索和总结出一套判断瓜熟不熟的道理。
    我们初步明确了这个道理之后，再来研究一下小麦生产经验。今年我们这一地区的小麦空前丰收。明年我们有把握夺取更大的丰收。这就是因为经过今年小麦丰收的实践，我们对如何争取小麦丰收有了更系统更深刻的认识。这种认识集中地表现在县委和县人民委员会在“1959年小麦跃进规划”中所提出的“五改”中：①改浅耕为深翻；②改少施肥为多施肥；③改旱地为水浇地；④改劣种为良种；⑤改稀植为密植。我们可以设想：如果没有去冬今春全县人民在党的领导下大干苦干地搞小麦生产这个实践，“五改”的经验是总结不出来的。当然，这个“五改”经验也不仅是我县一冬一春几个月的时间就得来的，而是全国劳动农民几千年来在小麦生产上日积月累的结果，也是党的正确领导、充分发挥群众干劲的结果。过去，劳动农民在小麦生产的经验上，就有这种说法：“地没赖地”、“人勤地不懒”、“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混”、“麦收八、十、三场雨”、“稀麦稠豆坑死人”、“好种结好果”……。这些，都是几千年来劳动农民在小麦生产的亲身实践中所总结出来的经验。自然，在这些经验中，有的带有片面性和落后性，如“麦收八、十、三场雨”这句话，就反映了单纯靠天的落后思想。解放后，党领导我们大家搞生产，经过几年来的大干苦干，特别是经过去冬今春的生产大跃进，就把前人在生产实践中总结出来的经验，更加丰富了、提高了、完善了。我们现在所说的小麦丰产的“五改”经验，就是从不断的小麦生产实践、不断的提高认识中总结得来的。九九归一，道理也是一样：离开了人们的生产实践，什么好经验也是得不到的！
    随着人们的实践活动的不断深入，人们的认识也要不断地深刻和提高；人们提高了认识，就可以更好地去指导自己的实践活动。如果实践发展了，人们不去认真总结新的实践经验，还是停留在老的认识水平上，那么，就不可能指导自己的实践活动继续向前发展，就会使自己的认识停滞，思想落后，跟不上时代。拿小麦丰产问题来说。去年种麦时节，有些人对深耕地、多施肥、浇足水、良种密植等先进措施搞不通。他们虽然也懂得一些种植小麦的老经验、老道理，但是，由于思想保守，不去总结新的经验，因而就不敢在老经验的基础上前进一步。他们认为：“深耕可以，但是不用耕七、八寸深”，“要多上粪，但一亩地上一万多斤弄不来”，“麦是需要水，但有一冬的雨雪就够了，用不着人浇”，“种的稠可以，而一亩地播二、三十斤种子是瞎弄”……。总之，在这些人看来，只有“老经验就够了”，新的要不得。由于存在着这种保守思想，很自然地，他们也就不相信小麦能够不断地飞跃地增产。今年小麦大丰产的事实告诉我们，这些人的老经验、老认识，是落后了。农业生产的潜力是无穷无尽的，只要人们不断地从实践中总结新的经验，不断地提高认识，那么，就可以把农业生产不断推向前进。
