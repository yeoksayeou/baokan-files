    Determined to be the Masters of Culture and Science
    Zhu Lishan, Worker at Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard
    I am a young lathe worker at the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard and also a student at our factory's shipbuilding university, philosophy research institute, and spare-time middle school. Living under the socialist system, I feel extremely happy. From the bottom of my heart, I deeply realize that under the leadership of the Party, we workers have not only become masters of the country but also masters of culture and science!
    I was born into an extremely poor family of a tricycle worker. My father contracted a serious eye disease. He had no money for treatment and had to haul over a thousand kilograms of goods for the capitalists while sick, resulting in him becoming a blind man. At the age of nine, the age when I should have been in primary school, I became a child laborer, weaving fish baskets and helping adults push tricycles at a fish basket shop every day. Sometimes, we didn't even have two meals of corn flour a day and had to take my young siblings to the streets to beg for food. From the age of fifteen, I worked as an apprentice in a small machine factory, working fourteen or fifteen hours a day from early morning to late at night. The burden of life was overwhelming, and there was no way to talk about learning culture and science.
    In 1952, when I was introduced by the labor bureau to work at the Qiuxin factory, I didn't know a single character except for a few numbers. Over the past few years, through the Party's cultivation and education, I have become a sixth-grade skilled worker and have improved from illiteracy to the cultural level of the second year of junior high school. This year, I also entered the spare-time shipbuilding university majoring in metal cutting and the philosophy research institute. Every Monday night, I study professional magazines and books on language and drafting. Learning has become an important part of my daily life.
    When I was an apprentice in a private small factory, I had never seen a drawing. Now, I can generally understand the drawings I encounter. I can also draw sketches, calculate the angles of gears, and study technical innovations. I solved the problem of processing ship tail shafts longer than the lathe by adding a beveled sleeve to the headstock of the lathe and other methods. I broke the convention of using pressure plates to hold crankshafts (main parts of diesel engines) for processing and solved the long-standing deformation problem during crankshaft processing. Recently, I cooperated with my fellow workers to change crankshaft processing from low-speed to high-speed cutting, reducing the time for processing the straight section of each crankshaft from more than 140 hours to 58 hours.
    After learning what the main contradiction is and that grasping the main contradiction can better promote the development of things, the workers of our Qiuxin factory used this philosophical principle to analyze that the current main contradiction of our factory is the contradiction between the urgent need for production and the excessively long production cycle. To solve this contradiction, we must put politics in command, vigorously carry out technical innovations, and use all means to achieve the leap forward target proposed by the Party committee of shortening the shipbuilding production cycle from 351 days to 82 days. One of the main obstacles to achieving a great leap in production is our piecework wage system. It prevents piecework workers from abandoning the old production quotas and implementing new quotas without any concerns, as time-rate workers can. It also affects the unity between workers. For me, the monthly basic wage is 90.6 yuan, but the monthly income is generally 120 yuan or 130 yuan, or even more than 160 yuan, which is unreasonable. Therefore, I, along with some young workers, firmly demanded that our factory abolish the piecework wage system and fully implement the time-rate wage system. This request has been approved by the leadership and formally implemented.
    In my spare time, in addition to studying and participating in voluntary labor, I enjoy reading novels and watching movies, playing billiards, and swimming. Now, my family lives in a new workers' residence. My older brother has also become a worker, and my sister and three other younger siblings are studying at school. My parents are spending their later years happily at home. Compared to the past, our life is truly paradise and hell. Our whole family knows that today's happiness is entirely brought to us by the beloved Party.
    Two years ago, on National Day, I gloriously joined the Party. Today is the ninth National Day of the motherland. In this era of the Great Leap Forward, I plan to learn dialectics, materialism, and historical materialism well in the philosophy research institute within two years, and reach the level of graduation from a higher vocational school within three to five years. I am determined to be a worker with a high degree of political consciousness and mastery of modern cultural and scientific knowledge, and contribute my whole life to the cause of communism.

### 决心做文化科学的主人

    决心做文化科学的主人
    上海求新造船厂工人　朱李山
    我是上海求新造船厂的一个青年车床工人，同时又是我们工厂造船大学、哲学研究学院和业余中学的学生。生活在社会主义制度下，我感到非常幸福。我从心底里深深体会到，在党的领导下，我们工人不但成了国家的主人，还要成为文化科学的主人！
    我出身在一个极其穷苦的塌车工人的家庭，父亲得了严重的眼疾，没有钱医治，还要带病给资本家拖一千多公斤重的货物，结果成了双目失明的瞎子。九岁，正是应该在小学读书的年龄，可是我却做了童工，每天到渔篮店编渔篮和帮大人推塌车。有时，连一天两顿的玉米粉也没得吃，只好带着年幼的弟妹们上街讨饭。十五岁起，我在一家小机器厂做了学徒工，每天从清早到深夜工作十四、五个小时。生活的重担压得人透不过气来，哪里还谈得到学习文化和科学。
    1952年我由劳动局介绍到求新厂工作时，除了几个数目字，一字不识。几年来，经过党的培养教育，我成了一个六级技术工人，由文盲提高到初中二年级的文化水平。今年我又进了业余造船大学金属切削专业和哲学研究学院。每个星期一晚上，我学习语文、制图等专业杂志和书籍。学习，已经成了我的日常生活中一个重要的部分。
    我在私营小厂作学徒时从来没有见过一张图纸，现在碰见图纸一般都能看懂，自己也能画画草图，计算齿轮的角度，研究技术革新了。我用在车床的车头中加入有斜度的套筒等办法，解决了比车床还长的船上尾轴的加工问题，打破了用压板压住曲轴（柴油机主件）进行加工的常规，解决了长期存在的曲轴加工时的变形问题。最近我又和搭班工人合作，将曲轴加工由低速改为高速切削，使加工每一根曲轴直档部分的时间由一百四十多小时缩短到五十八小时。
    学习了什么是主要矛盾，抓住主要矛盾可以更好地推动事物的发展以后，我们求新厂的工人就用这个哲学上的道理，分析出我们工厂当前的主要矛盾是生产需要迫切与生产周期太长的矛盾，为了解决这个矛盾，必须政治挂帅，大闹技术革新，用一切办法实现党委提出的将造船生产周期由三百五十一天缩短到八十二天的跃进指标。而实现生产大跃进的主要障碍之一，就是我们的计件工资制，它使计件制工人不能像计时工人那样毫无顾虑地放弃旧的生产定额实行新的定额，还影响工人之间的团结。以我来说，每月基本工资是九十点六元，可是每月收入一般都有一百二十元或一百三十元，甚至一百六十多元，这是不合理的。因此，我和一些青年工人一道坚决要求在我们工厂取消计件工资制，全部实行计时工资制。这个要求已经由领导上批准，正式实行了。
    在业余时间内，除了学习和参加义务劳动以外，我很喜欢看小说和电影，打台球和游泳。现在我们一家人住在新工房里，大弟弟也成了工人，妹妹和另外三个弟弟在学校学习，父母亲在家里愉快地度过晚年生活。我们的生活和过去相比，真是一个天堂，一个地狱。我们一家人都知道，今天的幸福，完全是亲爱的党带给我们的。
    两年前的国庆节，我光荣地参加了党。今天又是祖国第九个国庆节了。在这大跃进的时代，我打算两年内在哲学研究学院学好辩证法、唯物论和历史唯物主义，三年至五年内通过文化技术学习达到高等专科学校毕业的水平，决心做一个有高度政治觉悟的掌握现代文化科学知识的工人，为共产主义事业贡献我的一生。
