To Comrade Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

    On the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept my best congratulations, Minister. The Hungarian people, with sincere joy and great concern, are watching the remarkable achievements made by the fraternal and heroic Chinese people in the cause of building socialism, and wish the Chinese people further achievements in the great work of developing the national economy. I am very pleased to see that the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples has deepened day by day in the fields of politics, economy, science and technology, and culture over the past nine years, and has greatly promoted the prosperity of our two countries. I believe that the close friendly relations between our two peoples will be further consolidated in the future. I would like to reiterate that the Hungarian people fully support the Chinese people's just struggle against the repeated military provocations by the United States in the Taiwan area. I sincerely wish the heroic Chinese people further achievements in the struggle to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, and to benefit all peace-loving people.
                    András Sík
                    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic
