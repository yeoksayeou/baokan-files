Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai News. The National Metrology Work On-Site Conference held in Shanghai emphasized that metrology work must further implement the policy of focusing on industry and serving production; currently, it must first serve the steel industry. The conference called on metrology workers across the country, under the leadership of local Party committees, to rely on the masses and work hard for three months to solve the most urgent metrology problems in the steel industry.

Industrial and agricultural production and people's daily life are inseparable from metrology. In the industrial production process, metrology work is an important link. Whether the various instruments and meters manufactured by the factory are accurate, whether the various mechanical parts and components meet the standards, and whether the temperature, pressure, flow rate, and energy in industrial production processes such as smelting, chemical industry, and electricity are appropriate, etc., all require strict control and inspection with metrological instruments. Therefore, metrology work is called the "eyes" of industry. In recent years, with the development of national economic construction, large and medium-sized cities and large factories and enterprises across the country have successively established metrology institutions, which have played a certain role in promoting industrial production development.

After the Great Leap Forward in industrial production in various regions, especially the vigorous development of local industries, metrology work is required to cooperate more closely. Faced with this requirement, the meeting believed that metrology work must be accelerated and greatly leaped forward. Metrology agencies at all levels must first clarify that metrology work must focus on serving industry and closely revolve around the current central tasks of production. The old concept of focusing on weights and measures work in the thinking of some cadres must be completely reversed. The meeting pointed out that in order to achieve the Great Leap Forward and carry out metrology work in a faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to implement the mass line under the leadership of the Party, mobilize and organize the metrology forces scattered in factories, schools, and scientific research units, and carry out large-scale collaboration, so that metrology work becomes a mass work. The meeting required that within one year, a metrology network mainly serving industrial production should be established nationwide, with factories, mines, enterprises, and people's communes as the base points. On this basis, research should be strengthened, and national standards should be established, striving to reach the world's advanced level in terms of standard accuracy, measurement range, and verification methods within three years.

The representatives attending the meeting exchanged experiences in serving the Great Leap Forward in industrial production through metrology work. The Shanghai Municipal Metrology Agency, with the district as the unit, relied on the leadership of the Party committee to organize various factories, universities, and scientific research departments to cooperate, and selected qualified units to establish metrology offices and metrology stations in districts to replace the state in supervising and verifying some products produced by factories in the district and the metrological instruments they used. This not only made the verification work faster and better, but also solved the problem that the metrological instruments of some small factories had not been calibrated for a long time. The national metrology agencies were also able to free up their forces to help factories study the parts interchangeability, safe production and other issues that urgently needed to be solved in production from the perspective of metrology. The representatives unanimously believed that Shanghai's experience has universal significance for promotion.

This meeting was convened by the National Metrology Bureau of the State Technology Commission and lasted for eight days from September 16. More than 100 representatives from metrology agencies from provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and some special zones and counties across the country attended the meeting.

### 计量工作紧跟跃进形势  全国计量工作会议确定首先为工业服务

    计量工作紧跟跃进形势
    全国计量工作会议确定首先为工业服务
    新华社上海讯　在上海举行的全国计量工作现场会议强调提出，计量工作必须进一步贯彻以工业为主，为生产服务的方针；当前首先就要为钢铁工业服务。会议号召全国计量工作人员在当地党委领导下，依靠群众，苦战三个月，解决钢铁工业最急需的计量问题。
    工农业生产和人民日常生活都离不开计量。在工业生产过程中，计量工作是个重要环节。工厂制造出来的各种仪器、仪表是否精确，各种机械零件、部件是否合乎标准，冶炼、化学、电力等工业生产过程中的温度、压力、流量、能量是否适当等，都要用计量器具严格控制和检验。因此计量工作被称为工业的“眼睛”。几年来，随着国家经济建设的开展，全国各大中城市和大型工厂企业陆续建立了计量机构，对促进工业生产发展起了一定的作用。
    各地工业生产大跃进，特别是地方工业蓬勃发展以后，要求计量工作更加密切配合。面对这个要求，会议认为计量工作必须快马加鞭，大大跃进。各级计量机关首先要明确，计量工作必须以为工业服务为主，紧密围绕当前生产的中心任务来进行。目前部分干部思想上以度量衡工作为主的老概念必须彻底扭转。会议指出，为了实现大跃进，多快好省地开展计量工作，必须在党的领导下，贯彻执行群众路线，动员和组织分散在工厂、学校、科学研究单位的计量力量，大搞协作，使计量工作成为群众性的工作。会议要求一年内以工厂、矿山、企业、人民公社为基点，在全国范围内建立起一个为工业生产服务为主的计量网，并在这个基础上加强研究，建立国家基准，力争三年内在基准精确度、测量范围和检定方法上达到世界先进水平。
    到会代表交流了计量工作为工业生产大跃进服务的经验。上海市计量机关以区为单位，依靠党委领导，组织各工厂、大专学校和科学研究部门进行协作，选择有条件的单位，分区成立计量室、计量站，代替国家监督检定区内工厂生产的部分产品和他们使用的计量器具，不但使检定工作做得又快又好，而且解决了一些小厂计量器具长期没有校验的问题，国家计量机关也能腾出力量来帮助工厂从计量上研究生产上迫切需要解决的零件互换、安全生产等问题。代表们一致认为上海的这个经验具有普遍推广意义。
    这次会议是国家技术委员会国家计量局召开的，从9月16日起开了八天。参加会议的有全国各省市、自治区和部分专区、县的计量机关代表一百多人。
