“Seize Every Opportunity”
Kong Sang

After the "marshals" of steel and grain took command, they spurred many other areas of work to also leap forward together. However, some work was temporarily blocked. For example, now is the season for large quantities of agricultural products to come to market, but because the countryside is engaged in both large-scale steel production and autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting, the labor force is extremely strained. Therefore, the agricultural products that should be purchased have not been well acquired, and many of those that have been acquired have not been promptly transported out because transportation capacity has been taken up by the "marshals." In this situation, our task is to: allow the things spurred forward by the "marshals" to continue to leap forward; and to find every possible way to unclog the things temporarily blocked by the "marshals."

Can they be unclogged? The news of Sichuan Province's commercial purchasing work published today gives an affirmative answer and puts forward a very beneficial experience. Sichuan's experience is: under the unified arrangement of the Party Committee, adopt the method of large-scale movements encompassing small-scale movements, taking advantage of the gaps in the two major movements of steel and agriculture, "seizing every opportunity." The so-called "gaps" are the gaps in labor force, the gaps in time, and the gaps in transportation capacity. The so-called "opportunities" are the purchase and transportation of agricultural products. Judging from all aspects, although steelmaking, iron smelting, autumn harvesting, and autumn planting have taken up a lot of labor, a lot of time, and a lot of transportation capacity, and have formed an unprecedentedly tense situation; however, whether it is labor, time, or transportation capacity, there are still "holes." Take agricultural autumn harvesting and autumn planting as an example. After a few days of concentrated effort and hard work, there is a short period of rest. During this rest period, some of the labor and time originally used on the agricultural front becomes idle. The transportation situation is also the same. Now, trains and ships going from north to south are very busy, and the materials used by the two major "marshals" of steel and machinery cannot be transported quickly enough; but trains and ships going from south to north are not so busy, and there are many "gaps." The problem is that agricultural products have not been transported to the train stations; there are "gaps" but no "opportunities" to seize. Sichuan Province's experience tells us that under the unified arrangement of the Party Committee, as long as the commercial departments fully prepare when agriculture is making concentrated efforts and working hard, and arrange one "opportunity" after another, the commercial sector can immediately "seize every opportunity" when agriculture takes a rest, mobilizing the masses to make concentrated efforts to purchase and transport agricultural products. Agriculture concentrates its efforts, commerce prepares; agriculture rests, commerce concentrates its efforts. Prepare one batch, make a concentrated effort on one batch, then prepare another batch, and then make a concentrated effort on another batch. In this way, commercial work in other places can also be like Sichuan, completing all current tasks step by step, under the premise of ensuring the two central tasks of steel and grain.

This year is the first year of three years of hard struggle, and the situation of tight labor and tight transportation capacity has just emerged. After the establishment of the People's Communes, there are more things to do in the countryside than before. Before the realization of agricultural mechanization and modernization of transportation, the situation of tight rural labor and tight transportation capacity will continue for a considerable period. In this situation, many of the past working methods are no longer applicable. We should, through the purchase and sales work this winter and next spring, master the laws of commercial work in "extraordinary" periods, and learn the ability to do commercial work well in a situation of overall tight labor and tight transportation capacity.

    “见缝插针”
    孔桑
    钢铁、粮食两个元帅升帐以后，带动了很多工作都要一齐跃进。但是，同时也有些工作暂时被堵住了。例如，现在正是农产品大量上市的季节，可是由于农村中一面大搞钢铁，一面大搞秋收、秋耕、秋种，劳动力十分紧张，所以应当收购的农产品没有很好地收购起来，已经收购起来的也因为运输力量被元帅占去了，很多没有及时调运出来。在这种情况下，我们的任务就是：让元帅带动起来的东西继续向前跃进；被元帅暂时堵住的东西，也想出千方百计把它疏通。
    能不能疏通呢？今天发表的四川省商业收购工作的消息给了肯定的答复，并且提出了一个非常有益的经验。四川的经验就是：在党委的统一安排下，采取大运动套小运动的办法，利用钢铁和农业两大运动的空隙，“见缝插针”。所谓“缝”，就是劳动力的缝，时间的缝，运输力量的缝。所谓“针”，就是农产品的收购和调运。从各方面的情况来看，尽管炼钢、炼铁和秋收、秋种等工作占用了很多劳动力、很多时间和很多运输力量，而且形成了空前紧张的局面；但是，不管劳动力也好，时间也好，运输力量也好，“孔”还是有的。拿农业的秋收、秋种来说，突击了几天，苦战了几天之后，就有一个短暂的休整。这一个休整，原来用在农业战线上的劳动力和时间，就有一部分空闲下来了。运输的情况也是这样。现在从北往南的火车、轮船十分紧张，钢铁和机械两大元帅所用的物资老运不完；但从南往北的火车、轮船，就不那么紧张，“缝”多得很。问题是农产品没有运到火车站上来，有“缝”没有“针”插。四川省的经验告诉我们，在党委的统一安排下，只要商业部门在农业方面突击和苦战的时候，充分做好准备工作，把一支支“针”摆好，农业一休整，商业的“针”就可以马上插上去，发动群众突击收购和运送农产品。农业突击，商业准备，农业休整，商业突击。准备一批，突击一批，再准备一批，再突击一批。这样，其他地方的商业工作也就可以像四川一样，在保证钢铁和粮食两大中心工作的前提下，一步一步地把当前的任务全部完成。
    今年是苦战三年的第一年，劳动力紧张，运输力量紧张的局面刚刚露头。人民公社成立以后，农村要办的事情比以前多起来了。在农业机械化、交通运输现代化没有实现以前，农村的劳动力紧张情况、运输力量紧张的情况，还要继续一个相当时期。在这种情况下，已往的工作方法有很多已经不适用了。我们应该通过今冬明春的购销工作，掌握“非常”时期的商业工作的规律，学会在劳动力、运输力量全面紧张的情况下做好商业工作的本领。
