Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: The Kishi Nobusuke government and the United States government are currently conducting negotiations in Tokyo on the issue of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Douglas MacArthur II, among other U.S. and Japanese officials, held the second meeting in Tokyo on the 22nd regarding the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." The first meeting between the U.S. and Japan took place on October 4th.

According to Kyodo News, the central issues being discussed by both parties include the name of the new treaty and the issue of "the content of mutual cooperation" between the U.S. and Japan. The so-called "mutual cooperation" includes the Japanese side providing bases and other "obligations of cooperation," as well as the U.S. military's obligation to "defend Japan." In addition, the "scope of application" of the new U.S.-Japan military treaty was also discussed, including the "common defense" area, the necessary conditions for the use of U.S. troops in certain areas of the Far East, as well as the deployment and equipment of U.S. troops, and the duration of the new treaty.

During the discussions, the U.S. side particularly emphasized the content of Japan's "cooperation" and the necessary conditions for the use of U.S. troops in the new treaty.

Treaty Was Originally Unequal

The U.S.-Japan revision of the "Security Treaty" is a grand deception and a grand conspiracy. Its purpose is to strengthen U.S. military control over Japan and to completely drag Japan into the U.S.'s atomic war of aggression plans.

The U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" was signed on September 8, 1951, in San Francisco, at the same time as the one-sided peace treaty with Japan. This military treaty stipulates that the United States has "the right to station U.S. land, air, and naval forces within and around Japan," and stipulates that "such forces may be used to maintain international peace and security in the Far East" and to suppress the democratic movement of the Japanese people. In other words, according to this treaty, the United States can use Japan as a base, under the pretext of "maintaining international peace and security in the Far East," to carry out aggression against the people of Asian countries. The United States previously used this treaty to use Japan as a base for carrying out wars of aggression; currently, the United States is carrying out armed provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area, and has fully utilized the convenience provided by this treaty.

People Strongly Oppose Japan

Therefore, from the beginning, the Japanese people have firmly opposed this unequal treaty that ties Japan to the U.S. war machine, seeing clearly that it is the root cause of undermining Japan's sovereignty and endangering peace. Especially since the United States has intensified its creation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait area, the Japanese people, who have suffered greatly from imperialist wars of aggression, have become even more adamant in demanding the abolition of this "Security Treaty" that seriously endangers Japan's security.

Kishi Nobusuke Wants to Play Tricks

Faced with this situation, the Kishi Nobusuke government made some gestures in an attempt to ease the opposition of the Japanese people. Kishi Nobusuke and Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama went to Washington in June of last year and September of this year respectively to study the issue of so-called revising the "Security Treaty," and began negotiations in Tokyo on October 4th of this year.

Kishi Nobusuke has repeatedly proclaimed that the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to enable Japan to "develop autonomy" and to have "equal say" in the activities of U.S. troops stationed in Japan. However, news from various sources indicates that the U.S. government does not intend to grant Japan the status of an "equal partner" by revising the "Security Treaty." It is only attempting to take the opportunity to revise the treaty, which only allows the U.S. to use Japan as a war base, into a so-called "common defense treaty" or other "bilateral" treaty, under the guise of "common assistance," to make Japan assume the accomplice's obligation of participating in U.S. military aggression and to turn Japan into a nuclear war base. The Kishi Nobusuke government, which is eager to revive Japanese militarism and full of imperialist ambitions, also feels that this sinister plot by the United States is a welcome move that achieves two goals at once.

Colluding with Each Other to Engage in Aggression

According to the Yomiuri Shimbun some time ago, the Kishi Nobusuke government's proposed so-called "common defense treaty" will include: Japan will "cooperate" with the United States when U.S. troops take action as "United Nations forces," or when the U.S. and Japanese governments reach a comprehensive agreement on the actions the United States should take regarding the situation in the Far East. According to the draft of the new treaty formulated by the U.S. side, as revealed by United Press International, Japan also has an obligation to take action with the United States to deal with "common dangers," and stipulates that "the Japanese government grants, and the U.S. government accepts, the right to deploy within and around Japan such U.S. land, sea, and air forces as may be necessary to defend the Japanese area and help maintain international peace and security in the Far East." This shows that the new U.S.-Japan military treaty will not only retain the right for the U.S. to station troops in Japan, but will also increase Japan's obligation to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. aggression.

In order to realize its plot to drag Japan into its aggressive war system, the United States is also making every effort to include Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, which are under U.S. military occupation, into the so-called "U.S.-Japan common defense area" in the treaty. Kishi Nobusuke also claimed that Japan has "potential sovereignty" over these islands, and threatened to "regard an attack on Okinawa as an attack on Japanese territory." According to Kyodo News, the Japanese side has already made guarantees to the United States regarding this matter. Kyodo News commented that the administrative power of these islands is completely in the hands of the U.S. military, and Japan's so-called "potential sovereignty" is completely empty. Guaranteeing "joint defense" for Okinawa is "completely a dangerous act of plucking chestnuts from the fire."

Not only that, but after the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is revised into something like a "bilateral" "common defense treaty," the U.S.'s long-planned "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" will also be formed in fact. Through the rope of the U.S.-Japan, U.S.-Syngman Rhee, and U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek three "bilateral" mutual defense treaties, Japan, the Syngman Rhee clique, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique can be tied together, becoming tools for the United States to carry out aggression in the Far East, and Kishi Nobusuke has long been fantasizing about being the leader of this anti-communist organization. In order to realize these sinister plots, Kishi Nobusuke recently openly told U.S. journalist Brown that he wanted to delete the article on renouncing war from the Japanese constitution, and openly clamored to send troops abroad.

However, due to widespread opposition from the Japanese people, he knows that it will not be easy to smoothly realize his conspiracy in collusion with the United States, so he wants to play tricks on the wording of the revised U.S.-Japan treaty. According to Kyodo News, the Kishi Nobusuke government has already thought of using words like "consultation" in the treaty. For example, the U.S. military bases in Japan will "in principle" be called "supply bases," and will only be called "combat bases" when they are used to "defend" Japan. If the United States "uses them for other purposes," it will "consult" with Japan, and the issue of transporting nuclear weapons will also be covered up with the guise of "consultation" "to eliminate public concern about the issue of nuclear weapons." Kyodo News pointed out: "In urgent situations," it is impossible to conduct "consultation," so "people in the Kishi Nobusuke government also doubt the significance of the guise of 'consultation.'"

Plots and Tricks Are Difficult to Deceive People

The sleight of hand used by the Kishi Nobusuke government and U.S. imperialism in revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" cannot deceive the Japanese people. Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out during a questioning in the Japanese Diet on October 2nd that the Kishi Nobusuke government's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to strengthen Japan's imperialist system and attempt to participate in the U.S. atomic strategic system. The Japanese Socialist Party also issued a statement accusing the Kishi Nobusuke government of attempting to strengthen U.S. control over Japan in the form of a bilateral agreement under the guise of restoring Japan's "autonomy." The evil conspiracy of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries has aroused even greater anger among the Japanese people, and the movement demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is further surging.

### 偷天换日的骗局　狼狈为奸的阴谋  日美在搞修改“安全条约”勾当

    偷天换日的骗局　狼狈为奸的阴谋
    日美在搞修改“安全条约”勾当
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：东京消息：岸信介政府和美国政府目前正在东京就修改日美“安全条约”的问题进行谈判。日本外务相藤山爱一郎和美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二等日美双方官员，22日在东京举行了关于修改日美“安全条约”的第二次会谈。日美双方的第一次会谈是在10月4日举行的。
    据共同社透露，双方讨论的中心问题有新条约的名称和日美“互相合作的内容”的问题。所谓“互相合作”包括日本方面提供基地和其它“合作的义务”以及美军“保卫日本”的义务。此外还讨论了新的日美军事条约“适用范围”，包括“共同防御”地区、在远东的一定地区使用美军的必要条件，以及美军的部署和装备，新条约的期限等问题。
    在讨论中，美方特别强调了新条约中关于日本方面实行“合作”的内容和使用美军的必要条件的问题。
    条约本来不平等
    日美修改“安全条约”的勾当是一个大骗局，也是一个大阴谋。它的目的在于加强美国对日本军事上的控制和把日本彻底拖入美国的原子战争侵略计划。
    日美“安全条约”是1951年9月8日在旧金山和片面对日和约的同时签订的。这项军事条约规定，美国有“在日本国内及周围驻扎美国陆、空、海军之权利”，并且规定“此种军队得用以维持远东的国际和平与安全”以及镇压日本人民的民主运动。换言之，美国可以根据这项条约，利用日本做基地，借口
  “维持远东的国际和平与安全”对亚洲各国人民进行侵略。美国以前利用过这个条约把日本当作进行侵略战争的基地；目前，美国在台湾海峡地区对中国进行武装挑衅，又充分利用了这一条约所提供的便利。
    人民反对日强烈
    因此，日本人民一开始就坚决反对这一项把日本缚在美国战车上的不平等条约，看清它是破坏日本主权、危害和平的祸根。特别是在美国在台湾海峡地区加紧制造紧张局势以来，饱受帝国主义侵略战争之害的日本人民，要求废除这一严重危害日本安全的“安全条约”的情绪更加强烈。
    岸信介想耍花招
    面临着这种情况，岸信介政府做出了一些姿态企图缓和日本人民的反对情绪。岸信介和外务相藤山爱一郎先后在去年6月间和今年9月到华盛顿去，研究所谓修改“安全条约”的问题，并且在今年10月4日开始在东京举行谈判。
    岸信介一再宣扬，修改日美“安全条约”是要使日本“发扬自主性”，要对驻日美军的活动有“平等的发言权”。但是，各方面的消息表明，美国政府并不想通过修改“安全条约”给予日本“平等的伙伴”的地位，它只是企图趁机把美国只能把日本作为战争基地的条约修改成所谓“共同防御条约”这一类的“双边”条约，在“共同援助”的名义下，使日本承担参加美国军事侵略行动的帮凶义务，并且把日本变成核战争基地。而急于复活日本军国主义和满怀帝国主义野心的岸信介政府，也感到美国这一罪恶阴谋正是它求之不得的一举两得的事。
    互相勾结搞侵略
    据“读卖新闻”前些时候透露，岸信介政府拟议中的所谓“共同防御条约”将包括：在美军作为“联合国部队”采取行动的时候，或者在日美两国政府就美国对远东局势要采取的行动问题达成全面协议的时候，日本将同美国“合作”。据合众国际社透露的美国方面拟订的新条约草案也规定，日本有义务和美国一道采取行动对付“共同的危险”，并且规定，“日本政府给予，美国政府接受，在日本内部和周围部署为保卫日本地区和帮助保持远东国际和平与安全所可能必需的美国陆、海、空军部队的权利。”由此可见，新的日美军事条约不仅将保留美国驻军日本的权利，并且将增加日本充当美国侵略炮灰的义务。
    美国为了实现把日本拖入它的侵略战争体系的阴谋，还竭力主张在条约中把在美军占领下的冲绳和小笠原群岛划入所谓“日美共同防御地区”。岸信介也借口日本对这些岛屿有“潜在主权”，扬言“要把对冲绳的进攻看成是对日本国土的进攻”。据共同社报道，日本方面已经就这件事向美国提出了保证。共同社在评论这件事情的时候说，这些岛屿的行政权完全操在美军手里，日本的所谓“潜在主权”，完全徒具空名。对冲绳岛保证实行“联防”，“完全是一种火中取栗的冒险行动”。
    不仅如此，把日美“安全条约”修改为“双边”的“共同防御条约”之类的东西以后，美国蓄谋已久的“东北亚条约组织”也就在事实上形成了。通过美日、美李、美蒋三个“双边”攻守同盟条约这根绳子，就可以把日本、李承晚集团、蒋介石集团套在一起，成为美国在远东进行侵略的工具，而岸信介早就幻想着做这个反共组织的盟主。为了实现这些罪恶阴谋，岸信介最近已经公开向美国记者布朗表示他要从日本宪法中删去关于放弃战争的条款，并且公然叫嚣要派兵出国。
    但是，由于日本人民普遍的反对，他知道要顺利实现他同美国勾结的阴谋不很容易，便想在修改中的日美条约的措辞上耍花招。据共同社透露，岸信介政府已经想到要在条约中用“协商”这样的字眼。譬如在日本的美军基地，在“原则上”都把它们叫做“供应基地”，只在用于“保卫”日本的时候才叫做“作战基地”，如果美国“用于其它的目的”，就要同日本进行“协商”，并且要把运进核武器的问题也用“协商”的幌子遮起来，“以消除舆论对于核武器问题的忧虑”。共同社指出：“在形势紧迫的情况下”，是不可能进行“协商”的，因此，“协商”这个幌子在岸信介政府中的人士也怀疑它有什么意义。
    阴谋诡计难骗人
    岸信介政府和美帝国主义在修改日美“安全条约”时所用的偷天换日的手法，是瞒不过日本人民的。日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三10月2日在日本国会进行质询时指出，岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”是要加强日本的帝国主义体系，企图参加美国的原子战略体系。日本社会党也发表声明，指责岸信介政府是企图在恢复日本“自主性”的幌子下用双边协定的形式来加强美国对日本的控制。美日反动派的罪恶阴谋，激起了日本人民更大的愤怒，要求废除日美“安全条约”的运动，正在进一步高涨。
