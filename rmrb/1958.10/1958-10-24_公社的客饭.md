	The Commune's Guest Meal
	Jiangsu Tongshan Newspaper, Dong Yao

	Old man Zhang Mingzhong, carrying half a sack of flour, arrived at the canteen door, just as production team leader Wang Yongyi was hurrying out of the canteen. Team leader Wang said, "Uncle Zhang, what's up at the canteen? Hungry again?"
	Zhang Mingzhong felt embarrassed and stammered after a long while, "I—I—I'm delivering flour to the canteen."
	"Delivering flour?" Team leader Wang said with some surprise, "Where did you get the flour?"
	Zhang Lao Han said, "Take it first, and I'll do a separate self-criticism later."
	There was a reason for this half sack of flour: Zhang Mingzhong was nearly fifty years old, a bachelor, and lived comfortably. Ideologically, he was not behind either. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the team started a canteen, and it was decided to first mobilize everyone to contribute grain, then settle accounts uniformly.
	Hearing the news of using grain to run the canteen, Zhang Mingzhong felt a little uneasy. Zhang Mingzhong had a daughter who, although married for over ten years, the old man still thought about her every two or three days. And the daughter? She also came to visit every two or three days, saying that she was busy with the Great Leap Forward, the daughter would still take a morning or half a day to see her old dad. This time, the family had just prepared white flour, and the team mobilized to start a canteen. The old man thought to himself: the canteen is one portion per person, and when my daughter comes, don't even mention eating something satisfactory, she won't even be able to get a meal.
	When Team leader Wang came to mobilize Zhang Mingzhong to take the lead, Zhang Mingzhong brought out the flour jar from the house, knocking it loudly with his chopsticks, and said, "Team leader Wang, as long as we have these things, we will take the lead. I am just straightforward and never hide anything from the commune."
	On the third day the canteen was open, Zhang Mingzhong's daughter came, bringing a six- or seven-year-old girl. When the old man saw his daughter, he was secretly delighted: luckily, I didn't give the flour to the canteen, otherwise, my daughter wouldn't even be able to get a bowl of rice, that would make her so sad! The old man planned to cook for his daughter after the canteen had finished serving and people had gone to work in the fields.
	The news of Zhang Mingzhong's daughter's arrival was known to the canteen. According to the commune's regulations, canteen manager Wang Zaihua asked the cook to make guest meals for two people. Zaihua also specially went to the nursery to get a bag of sweets, and at lunchtime, he delivered them together to Zhang Mingzhong's house.
	When Zhang Mingzhong saw Wang Zaihua carrying a full tray of steamed buns and hot dishes, he was suspicious. Wang Zaihua said with a smile: "Uncle Zhang, has the guest arrived? The guest meal is here!"
	"Guest meal?"
	"Yes!" Wang Zaihua said, placing the tray down, "The commune canteen's rule is that guests get guest meals, and guest meals get two extra dishes. You have a child visiting, so we added sweets as well."
	Zhang Mingzhong, his daughter, and his granddaughter couldn't finish all the food that was sent.
	In the afternoon, his daughter left, and the old man felt more and more uneasy. The commune is so good to us, but we lied to the commune. So, Zhang Lao Han found a flour sack, took out all the white flour hidden under the bed, and sent it to the commune canteen.
	Team leader Wang accepted the flour. Zhang Mingzhong repeatedly made a self-criticism in front of everyone, saying that he shouldn't have been of two minds about the commune. Team leader Wang said with a smile, "Uncle Zhang, you are good, we welcome you doing this. As long as you believe in the commune and are of one mind with the commune, you will never be wrong; the commune, of course, has more advantages than the cooperative."

    公社的客饭
    江苏铜山报　董尧
    张明忠老汉背着半袋子面，走到食堂门口，正碰上生产队长王永义慌里慌张地从食堂里往外走。王队长说：“张大爷，来食堂啥事，又饿啦？”
    张明忠不好意思起来，老半天才结结巴巴地说：“我——我——我送面给食堂的。”
    “送面”？王队长有点惊奇的说“你哪儿来的面呀”？
    张老汉说：“先收下吧，以后我另检讨”。
    这半袋面，说来有原因：张明忠快五十岁了，光棍一个人，生活满宽裕；论思想，也不落后，人民公社成立后，队里就办起了食堂，用的粮食就决定先动员大家出，然后统一算账。
    听到拿粮食办食堂的消息，张明忠心里就有点不安，原来张明忠有一个闺女，虽然出嫁十多年了，可老汉还是三天两头的想；闺女呢？也三天两头的来，就说眼下大跃进忙了吧，闺女还是抽出一早晨、半天来看看老爹。这次家里刚刚准备了白面，队里动员办食堂，老汉心中就想：食堂一人一份，闺女来了别说吃上称心的，连饭也无法吃。
    王队长来动员张明忠带头的时候，张明忠从屋里端出面缸，用筷子敲的??直响，说：“王队长，这些事咱只要有，没有不带头的，我这人就是心直，从来不会瞒社。”
    食堂办起第三天，张明忠的女儿来了，还带了一个六、七岁的女孩子。老汉一看闺女来了，心中就暗喜：幸亏没有把面给食堂，要不，闺女连碗饭也吃不上，这多让她伤心呀！老汉盘算着等食堂开过饭，人下地以后，再做饭给女儿吃。
    张明忠女儿来的消息，被食堂知道了，按照公社的规定，食堂管理员王在华叫炊事员做了两个人的客饭，在华还特地到托儿所里要了一包糖果，中午吃饭的时候，一起送到张明忠家里。
    张明忠一看王在华端了满满一托盘馍、热腾腾的菜，就猜疑，王在华笑着说：“张大爷，来的客呢？客饭送来了！”
    “客饭？”
    “是呀！”王在华一边放下托盘，一边又说：“公社食堂的规定，来客有客饭，客饭要另加两个菜；你家来客有小孩，另外又加上糖果。”
    送来的饭菜，张明忠和女儿、外孙女一起也没有吃得了。
    下午，闺女走了，老汉越想越不安，公社对咱这么好，咱还对公社说谎。于是张老汉找个面袋，把藏在床下的白面都拿出，送给公社食堂。
    王队长把面收下，张明忠当着大伙的面一再作了检讨，说不该对公社三心二意，王队长笑着说：“张大爷，你很好，我们欢迎你这样做，只要相信公社，和公社一条心，准不会有错；公社吗，当然比合作社有更多的优越性”。
