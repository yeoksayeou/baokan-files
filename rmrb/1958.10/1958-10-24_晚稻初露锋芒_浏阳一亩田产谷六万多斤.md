    Late Rice Begins to Show Promise
    Liuyang One Mu of Land Yields Over 60,000 Jin of Grain
    (Reported by this newspaper) A high-yield "satellite" of late rice has soared into the sky in the Hongzhuan People's Commune in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. The 1.01 mu of late rice field in this commune yielded an average of 66,277 jin of dry grain per mu.
    This plot of land was an experimental field jointly cultivated by Zhou Wulin, the former Party Secretary of Shegang Township (now Deputy Director of the Hongzhuan Commune), Xu Shengming, the former Director of the Chenguang Agricultural Cooperative, and Xun Tonglu, the Deputy Director. The experience of high yield is: using the "Lao Huang Gu" (Old Yellow Valley) improved variety, early sowing (three days before Mangzhong down to the soil), early transplanting (the day before Xiaoshu), and highly dense planting (the distance between plants and rows is less than one inch); deep plowing of 1.6 chi; applying fertilizer in stages according to proportions, five times in total, applying a total of 3,200 dan of grass fertilizer, 50 dan of night soil, 800 dan of old brick soil, 240 jin of bone meal, 30 jin of ammonium sulfate, 1,200 dan of grass ash, and 600 jin of lime; strengthening field management, carrying out five cultivations, frequent irrigation with shallow water, and preventing natural disasters.
    On the 18th, when the harvest began, Li Yingxing, the County Chief of Liuyang County, also rushed to the scene to participate in the harvesting. It took them two full days to complete the harvest.

    晚稻初露锋芒
    浏阳一亩田产谷六万多斤
    本报讯　一颗晚稻高产大“卫星”在湖南浏阳县红专人民公社腾空而起。这个社的一点零一亩晚稻田，平均亩产干谷六万六千二百七十七斤。
    这丘田是原社港乡党委书记（现红专公社副社长）周五林、原晨光农业社社长徐升命、副社长寻通闾共同种的试验田。丰产的经验是：用“老黄谷”良种，早播（芒种前三天下泥），早插（小暑前一天），高度密植（棵行距不到一寸）；深耕一点六尺；按比例分期施肥，前后共五次，共下了三千二百担草肥、五十担大粪、八百担陈砖土、二百四十斤骨粉、三十斤硫酸铵、一千二百担草木灰、六百斤石灰；加强田间管理，共进行五次中耕，勤灌浅灌和防止自然灾害。
    18日开镰时，浏阳县县长李映兴也赶到现场参加收割。他们整整两天才全部收完。
