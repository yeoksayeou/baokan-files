    The First Breakfast
    Ye Peng, Qianhaizi Elementary School, Mengjin, Henan

    The window paper was just turning white when Grandma got up, bustling around the stove, making the bowls and plates clink. Before long, Mom got up too, washed her face, tied a towel around her head, and grabbed her hoe to head out. Mom saw Grandma's fussing and said to her with a smile, "Grandma, don't bother, just get it from the canteen later." Grandma waved her hand and said, "I won't eat." Mom left, and Grandma sat on the edge of my bed and said, "Your grandma is old, useless, can't even cook anymore." I didn't say anything, just pretended to be asleep.
    The paper on the lattice window slowly turned red. Usually, I would have gotten up long ago. Today, I especially wanted to get up early and see the commune's canteen. How would they cook in such a big pot? Yesterday, the cart went to the city to fetch the pot. Wow, it was so big that I couldn't see Little Mao when he was lying in the back. ... I was also afraid that if I jumped and ran out, Grandma would get angry.
    When Grandma went to sweep the back room, I rolled out of bed and sneaked out, running straight to the canteen. Uncle Mengcai was slicing the noodles! Uncle Mengcai said to us, "Who can strike the bell! It's time for breakfast!" Little Qun grabbed the wooden stick, clang! clang clang! banging away. After a while, the people from the fields all came back, each family carrying earthenware pots and basins to hold the noodles. Little Mao's mom even brought a new washbasin, laughing and shouting all the way, "Come on! We're entering socialism!" which made everyone bend over laughing.
    Only my grandma wasn't coming yet. I was really anxious and wanted to run back and call her, but as soon as I went out, Grandma came tottering along on her bound feet.
    While eating, Grandma walked to Mom's side and said to her, "This won't do! You don't even let me cook anymore. Talk to the commune and find some work for me!" Mom said, "The branch secretary said the commune is going to set up a shoe factory, let's sign you up too!" Grandma was happy now: "Really? That's more like it!"

    第一顿早餐
    河南孟津前海资小学　叶　鹏
    窗纸刚刚发白，奶奶就起来了，在锅台旁转来转去，把碗盏碰得直叮当。不一会，妈也起来啦，洗了脸，把手巾往头上一扎，抓起锄头就往外走。妈见奶奶那样子，就笑着对奶奶说：“奶奶，别瞎忙啦，等会到食堂里领吧。”奶奶挥挥手，说：“我不吃。”妈走了，奶奶坐在我床沿说：“你奶奶老了，不中用了，连饭都不叫做啦。”我没说话，只装睡着了。
    格子窗上的纸慢慢变红了，在平时，我早就起床啦，今天我特别想早点起来，到社里的食堂去瞧瞧。这样大的锅，他们该怎么煮？昨天大车进城拉锅，嗬，真大，小毛儿躺在后面我一点也看不见。……我又怕蹦着跳着出去，奶奶要生气。
    等奶奶到后屋扫地去了，我一滚就下了床溜出去，直往食堂里跑。孟才叔正在下面片哩！孟才叔对我们说：“谁会打钟！开饭啦！”小群抢过木棒，当！当当！乱撞了一阵。一会儿，下地的人都回来啦，每家都提了瓦罐、盆来盛面片，小毛儿妈还拿了个新的洗脸盆，一路上敲敲打打地笑着喊：“来！过社会主义啦！”逗得大家都笑弯了腰。
    就是我奶奶还不来，我真急，想跑回去叫她，刚出门，奶奶颠着小脚来啦。
    吃饭时，奶奶走到妈妈旁边，对妈说：“这样可不行啊！连饭都不叫我做了，和社里说说，给我找点活！”妈说：“支书说社里要办鞋厂，给你也报个名吧！”奶奶这下乐了：“真的？这才像个话！”
