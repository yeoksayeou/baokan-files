    At the Yilin Satellite Ironworks
    "You have to see clearly, see which direction the ore vein is going. If the ore vein stretches horizontally, dig horizontally; if it stretches straight, dig straight." Han worker Hou Daikin patiently pointed out to Mo Ruzhen, and then dug a test trench for him to see.
    Mo Ruzhen, this Dong youth farmer, only entered the factory at the end of August, and the leadership assigned him to prospecting. He knew nothing about finding or prospecting for ore, and was really worried. However, the Han elder brother took the initiative to help, which enabled him to quickly learn prospecting techniques and lead new workers to the mountains to find ore. Recently, he and Hou Daikin moved into a room, slept in the same bed, and were as close as brothers.
    The hundreds of Dong and Han workers at the Yilin Satellite Ironworks are all so friendly and helpful, as close as brothers. This ironworks was born in the common leap forward of the Dong and Han people. The Satellite People's Commune in the Dong area produces coal and timber, but has no iron ore; the Rocket People's Commune in the Han area has iron ore, but no coal and timber. Under the call of the whole party and the whole people to run iron and steel, the members of the two communes broke down the traditional concept of boundaries and made full use of each other's resources. In August, they jointly established this ironworks for the first time. Now, the two communes are still preparing to set up eleven such united iron and steel plants. Lu Xinglun

    在宜林卫星铁厂
    “要看得准，看准矿苗朝那个方向走，矿苗横着伸去就横挖，直伸就直挖。”汉族工人侯代金耐心地向莫如珍指点着，说完便挖探槽给他看。
    莫如珍，这个侗族青年农民8月底才进厂，领导上分配了搞探矿。他对找矿、探矿一窍不通，心里真着急。但是，汉族老大哥主动地来帮助，使他很快学会探矿技术，能够带领新工人上山找矿了。最近他和侯代金搬到一间屋里，同睡一张床，亲如兄弟。
    宜林卫星铁厂的几百个侗、汉族工人，都是这样友爱互助，亲如兄弟。这个铁厂是在侗、汉两族人民共同跃进中诞生的。侗族区的卫星人民公社产煤炭和木材，但是没有铁矿；汉族区的火箭人民公社有铁矿，却没有煤炭和木材。两个公社的社员在全党全民办钢铁的号召下，破除了传统的地界观念，互相充分利用资源，8月间第一次联合建立起这个铁厂，现在，这两个公社还在筹办十一个这样的团结钢铁厂。　鲁兴伦
