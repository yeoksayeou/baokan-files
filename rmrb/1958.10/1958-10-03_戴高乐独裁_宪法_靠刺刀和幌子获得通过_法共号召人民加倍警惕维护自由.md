De Gaulle's Dictatorial "Constitution" Passed with Bayonets and Deception
French Communist Party Calls on People to Increase Vigilance and Defend Freedom

This newspaper reports that under an atmosphere of fascist terror, relying on large-scale deceptive propaganda and intimidation, and with the support of various bourgeois parties and the right-wing of the Socialist Party that betrayed the republican system, De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution" draft has been passed in the "referendum" held in mainland France.

According to materials released by the French Ministry of the Interior, the final result of the "referendum" held in mainland France on September 28 was: out of 26,600,694 registered voters, 22,595,703 people voted in the "referendum." Among them, 17,666,828 votes were in favor, and 4,624,475 votes were against. Despite De Gaulle's repeated demands that the French people not abstain from voting in this "referendum," about 15% of those with the right to vote still did not vote.

De Gaulle's constitution, having passed the "referendum," will be announced and take effect on October 5.

De Gaulle also orchestrated a "referendum" farce in Algeria and France's African colonies. In Algeria, fascists mobilized 400,000 troops to completely control the voting in the area. The local Muslim residents had no possibility of freely expressing their will. On the eve of the vote, all roads were blocked. On the day of the vote, voters were forced to go by the army and vote under military supervision, and there was no one to supervise the counting of votes.

In other French colonies, despite the pressure of colonialists' bayonets, the people of each colony did everything possible to resist De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution." Agence France-Presse admitted that the percentage of abstentions in the voting in various colonies was very high.

The passage of De Gaulle's "constitution" has paved the way for De Gaulle, who seized power through a military coup, to establish a dictatorship in France. France faces the threat of fascism. However, this does not indicate the strength of the French monopoly bourgeoisie, nor does it mean that the French political situation will be calm from now on. On the contrary, the various contradictions in France will be further deepened, and the class struggle will become increasingly acute. On the one hand, the De Gaulle regime cannot solve the two major problems facing France: the Algerian problem and serious financial and economic difficulties; on the other hand, De Gaulle's dictatorial policies will gradually make the French people recognize his true face, thereby dispelling illusions and strengthening the struggle.

The long-tested French democratic forces have begun to act and fight against the threat of fascism. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the results of the "referendum" on De Gaulle's dictatorial "constitution," pointing out that the French Communist Party, which has fought against the "constitution," will continue to take action to maintain freedom with increased vigilance and will help the masses of people move towards this goal.

The French Communist Party called on all Communist Party members and all other democrats, who have proven to be the main force of the opposition, to make enthusiastic efforts to achieve peace in Algeria, safeguard the demands of workers' rights, defend threatened freedoms, and strive to achieve a democratic and French policy.

The French Communist Party declared that the masses of people, who have learned from their own experiences and enlightened by the French Communist Party, will soon discover the true nature of De Gaulle's policies and will be able to find ways to realize their aspirations through democratic means.

### 戴高乐独裁“宪法”靠刺刀和幌子获得通过  法共号召人民加倍警惕维护自由

    戴高乐独裁“宪法”靠刺刀和幌子获得通过
    法共号召人民加倍警惕维护自由
    本报讯　在法西斯恐怖的气氛下，依靠大规模的欺骗宣传和恫吓等卑鄙手法，依靠叛卖共和制度的法国各资产阶级政党和社会党右翼的支持，戴高乐的独裁“宪法”草案已经在法国本土举行的“公民投票”中获得通过。
    据法国内政部公布的材料，9月28日在法国本土举行的“公民投票”的最后结果是：在二千六百六十万零六千九百四十八个选民中，有二千二百五十九万五千七百零三人在“公民投票”中投了票。其中投赞成票的有一千七百六十六万六千八百二十八票，投反对票的有四百六十二万四千四百七十五票。尽管戴高乐一再要求法国人民在这次“公民投票”中不要弃权，但是，仍旧有大约15％有投票权的人没有去投票。
    戴高乐宪法在“公民投票”中通过后，将在10月5日公布生效。
    戴高乐还在阿尔及利亚和法国在非洲的属地导演了“公民投票”丑剧。在阿尔及利亚，法西斯分子出动了四十万大军，完全控制了这个地区的投票。当地穆斯林居民完全没有可能自由地表达自己的意志。在投票前夕，一切道路都被封锁了，到投票的那一天，选民们由军队强迫前往，在军队监视下投票，而在计票的时候又没有人监票。
    在法国其他属地，尽管在殖民者的刺刀压迫下，各属地人民仍尽一切可能抵制戴高乐的独裁“宪法”。法新社承认，各属地投票中弃权的百分比很高。
    戴高乐“宪法”的通过，为依靠军事政变而夺取政权的戴高乐在法国建立独裁统治铺平了道路。法国面临着法西斯的威胁。但是，这决不表明法国垄断资产阶级力量的强大，也不意味着法国政局从此将风平浪静。相反地，法国的各种矛盾将更加深刻化，阶级斗争将日益尖锐。一方面，戴高乐政权决不可能解决法国面临的两个主要问题：阿尔及利亚问题和严重财政经济困难；另一方面，戴高乐的独裁政策将使法国人民逐渐认清他的面目，从而丢掉幻想，加强斗争。
    久经斗争考验的法国民主力量已经开始行动起来，为反对法西斯的威胁而斗争。法国共产党政治局就表决戴高乐独裁“宪法”的“公民投票”的结果发表了声明，指出为反对“宪法”而进行了斗争的法国共产党将再接再厉采取行动加倍警惕地维护自由，并将帮助人民群众朝着这个目标迈进。
    法国共产党要求已经证明是反对派的主力的全体共产党员和其他所有民主人士热情充沛地作出努力，争取实现阿尔及利亚的和平，维护劳动者的权利要求，保卫受到威胁的自由并争取实现一项民主的、法国的政策。
    法国共产党申明，经受自己的经验的教训和法国共产党的启发的人民群众，不久即将发现戴高乐的政策的真正性质，并将能找到办法通过民主途径来实现自己的愿望。
