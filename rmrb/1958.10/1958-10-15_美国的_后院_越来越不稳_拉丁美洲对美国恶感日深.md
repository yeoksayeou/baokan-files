Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: The British "Observer" recently published an article titled "Latin American Common Market," commenting on the meeting of foreign ministers of twenty-one American nations held in Washington last month. The article pointed out that it was impossible for the United States to achieve its goal of consolidating its position in Latin America and further economically plundering these countries through this meeting.

The article pointed out that for political, emotional, and economic reasons, the people of Latin America do not like the current colonial status they have with the United States. At the same time, they are not satisfied with the "gifts" that the United States gives them in the form of grants, long-term loans, and investments.

The article talked about the current political situation in Latin American countries, saying that, apart from the dictatorial rule in Dominica and Batista's shaky dictatorial regime in Cuba, Latin American countries are now more united and mature than ever before. The article emphasized that the days when the United States intended to obtain favorable concessions from those iron-fisted figures who manipulated their countries as private enterprises are gone forever.

    美国的“后院”越来越不稳
    拉丁美洲对美国恶感日深
    据新华社13日讯　英国“观察家报”不久以前以“拉丁美洲的共同市场”为题发表文章，评论上月在华盛顿举行的二十一个美洲国家外交部长会议。文章指出，美国企图通过这次会议来巩固它在拉丁美洲的地位和达到进一步从经济上掠夺这些国家的目的已经不可能实现了。
    文章指出，拉丁美洲人民由于政治、情感以及经济上的原因，并不喜欢他们和美国之间目前所处的这种殖民地地位。同时，他们对美国以赠款、长期贷款和投资形式所给他们的“恩赐”并不感到满意。
    文章谈到目前拉丁美洲各国的政治局势时说，除了多米尼加的独裁统治以及巴蒂斯塔在古巴的摇摇欲坠的独裁政权以外，拉丁美洲各国现在比以往任何时候都更加团结和成熟了。文章强调指出，美国打算从那些把他们的国家当作私人企业来操纵的铁腕人物那里取得有利的让步的日子已经一去不复返了。
