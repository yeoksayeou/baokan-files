Yinchuan Ballad
—A Selection of New Folk Songs from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region

What brings joy to the heart, what flower blooms in a sea of red?
What tree's leaves stay green all year round?
What brings joy to the heart? What root grows deep?
The pomegranate flower blooms in a sea of red,
The pine and cypress leaves stay green all year round,
The establishment of the Autonomous Region brings joy to the heart,
The socialist root grows deep.

With our own hands, we pushed down the Helan Mountains,
Fighting hard day and night for thirty days,
With our own hands, we pushed down the Helan Mountains,
Ordering the mountain gods to offer their treasures,
Steel spears pierce through the nine layers of heaven.

Tramping across the thousand-foot peaks of the Northern Mountains,
Seeking treasures in the depths of the white clouds,
Smelting steel and machines,
We will surely surpass England within fifteen years.

The blast furnace touches the sky,
The earth furnace presses the beach,
Yesterday we harvested rice and cotton,
Today we smelt steel,
Don't look down on the peasants,
We can do anything.

Our feet tread to reverse the flow of the Yellow River
Our feet tread to reverse the flow of the Yellow River,
Knocking down the Helan Mountains for pillows,
Everyone twisting into a single rope,
We swear not to rest until the task is completed.

Ten thousand catties of fertilizer piled into ten thousand hearts,
Hearts focused on achieving double the thousand catties,
The dung pile higher than the Helan Mountains,
Grain flowing like a river that never runs dry.

If we want to eat without relying on the heavens,
We'll open canals and lead water up the high mountains,
Turning dry land into irrigated fields,
Achieving ten thousand catties per mu is not difficult.

Brother works in the Leaping Forward Canal
Brother works in the Leaping Forward Canal,
Sister works in the rice paddies.
The water of the Leaping Forward Canal is full of affection,
Brother and sister are of one heart.

    银川曲
    ——宁夏回族自治区新民歌选
    什么事儿喜人心什么花开一片红？什么树叶四季青？什么事儿喜人心？什么根儿扎得深？石榴花开一片红，松柏树叶四季青，自治区成立喜人心，社会主义根扎深。
    双手推倒贺兰山昼夜苦战三十天，双手推倒贺兰山，喝令山神献宝藏，钢铁戮破九重天。*　*踏遍北山千丈峰，白云深处把宝寻，炼出钢铁和机器，十五年内准超英。 *　*高炉顶上天，地炉逼沙滩，昨天收稻棉，今天把钢炼，别看庄稼汉，样样都能干。足踏黄河水倒流足踏黄河水倒流，推倒贺兰当枕头，大家拧成一股劲，不完成任务誓不休。
  *　*万斤肥堆万颗心，心心向着双千斤，粪堆高过贺兰山，粮如河水流不干。
  *　*要想吃饭不靠天，开渠引水上高山，旱地变成水浇地，亩产万斤不费难。
    哥在跃进渠哥在跃进渠，妹在稻田里。跃进渠水情意深，阿哥阿妹一条心。
