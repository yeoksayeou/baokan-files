Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. Liaoning Province's million-strong iron and steel army fought day and night, releasing the largest daily output "satellite" of steel and iron in the province's history on the 29th. On this day, the province's steel output reached 24,446.6 tons, an increase of 59.4% compared with the average daily output of the first twenty-eight days of September; iron output reached 22,295 tons, an increase of 33% compared with the average daily output of the first twenty-eight days of September.

In the battle to launch high-yield steel "satellites" across the province, hundreds of thousands of iron and steel workers in Anshan, Benxi, and Lüda took the lead. Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking and steelmaking workers both launched high-yield "satellites." The daily steel output leaped to 20,200 tons, and the daily iron output reached 14,863 tons. Steelmaking workers at Benxi Iron and Steel Company set a new record of producing 6,159 tons of pig iron per day. On the 29th, two blast furnaces at the First Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company once again set the highest daily output records.

Electric furnaces, converters, and small open-hearth furnaces in machinery factories in major cities across the province also launched high-yield steel "satellites." On the 29th, more than thirty electric furnaces, converters, and open-hearth furnaces in Shenyang produced 1,480 tons of steel, an increase of 55% compared with the actual output of the previous day.

After one day of battle on the 29th, a large number of native blast furnaces were newly built in various regions of the province. Most of these native blast furnaces were immediately put into production, greatly increasing pig iron production.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th. The steelmaking workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company created an excellent achievement of producing 20,200 tons of steel on the 29th, as a gift to National Day. This achievement exceeded the enterprise's average daily planned output by 6,500 tons, and the increased output was equivalent to the daily steel output of six large open-hearth furnaces.

Anshan Iron and Steel's new abundant achievement demonstrates the great power of the communist style. Comrade Li Fuchun's statement to the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, "Whoever has more communist ideology will create miracles," encouraged the daring and proactive spirit of all workers. During the high-yield day on the 29th, the factory did not add any equipment. On the contrary, one large open-hearth furnace was under maintenance. However, due to the workers giving full play to their subjective initiative, boosting their energy, and adopting some innovative measures that broke with conventions, they finally created an unprecedented achievement of abundant production.

On the 29th, Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking plant, sintering plant, ingot plant, transportation department, and other units all set new records. The daily output of pig iron reached 14,863 tons, more than 2,000 tons more than the highest daily output in the plant's history.

    辽宁日产钢铁各两万多吨
    鞍钢创日产两万零二百吨的新纪录
    据新华社沈阳30日电　辽宁省一百多万钢铁大军奋战一昼夜，在29日放出全省有史以来最大的钢铁日产量“卫星”。这一天，全省钢产量达到二万四千四百四十六点六吨，比9月份前二十八天的平均日产量提高59.4％；铁产量达到二万二千二百九十五吨，比9月份前二十八天的平均日产量提高33％。
    在全省大放钢铁高产“卫星”的战斗中，鞍山、本溪和旅大十几万钢铁工人走在最前列。鞍钢炼铁工人和炼钢工人都放出了高产“卫星”，钢的日产量跃进到了二万零二百吨，铁的日产量达到了一万四千八百六十三吨，本溪钢铁公司炼钢工人创造出日产生铁六千一百五十九吨的最高纪录。本溪钢铁公司第一炼铁厂，29日有两座高炉再次创造了日产量最高纪录。
    全省各主要城市机械工厂的电炉、转炉和小平炉，也放出了钢铁高产“卫星”。沈阳市三十多座电炉、转炉和平炉，在29日炼出了一千四百八十吨钢，比前一天实际产量提高55％。
    经过29日一天的战斗，全省各地区又新建了一大批土高炉。这些土高炉大部分都立即投入生产，大大增加了生铁产量。
    据新华社鞍山30日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼钢职工在29日创造了日产钢两万零二百吨的优异成就，向国庆节献礼。这一成就超过这个企业的平均日计划产量六千五百吨，增产的部分等于六座大型平炉一天的产钢量。
    鞍钢这个新的丰产成果，显示了共产主义的风格的伟大力量。李富春同志向鞍钢职工提出的“谁有更多的共产主义思想，谁就会创造奇迹”，鼓舞了所有职工的敢想敢干的干劲。在29日的高产日中，各厂没有增加任何设备，相反地还有一座大型平炉在检修，但是由于发挥了人的主观能动性，全体职工，鼓足干劲，采取了一些打破陈规的革新措施，终于创造了空前未有的丰产成就。
    29日，鞍钢的炼铁厂、烧结总厂、钢锭厂、运输部等单位，都创造了新的纪录。生铁日产量达到了一万四千八百六十三吨，比全厂历史上的最高日产量多出两千多吨。
