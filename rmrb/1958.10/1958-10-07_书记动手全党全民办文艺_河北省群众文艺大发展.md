Reported by our newspaper: Under the situation of the all-round leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the mass cultural and artistic creation in Hebei Province, like other provinces, has blossomed everywhere. Like the "factory history" writing activities of workers in Tianjin, the folk song and mural creation activities in Shulu, Zunhua, Shahe, and Huailai, the song and dance, Quyi, and fine arts creation in Changli, and the script, drum ballad, fast-clapper talk, and song creation in Huai'an, all have formed mass movements. Shulu County, with a population of 400,000, has 4,319 creation groups and a creation army of over 223,000 people. From January to August this year alone, nearly 940,000 pieces of various styles of literary and artistic works were created, which is an unprecedentedly prosperous scene of mass cultural and artistic activities.

In this vigorously developing mass cultural and artistic creation movement, a large number of talented worker-peasant authors have emerged. For example, the literary and art group of the Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory created dozens of various literary and artistic works based on real-life themes, which they wrote, directed, and performed themselves, playing a significant role in the self-education of the workers. In Changli's Liangshan Township, one township alone has more than 60 newspaper and journal correspondents, who have contributed more than 560 articles to various newspapers and journals since June last year, of which more than 350 have been published. Li Shenglu, a peasant author in Juelun Village, Huai'an County, who only knows more than 500 characters, wrote five scripts in just over half a year due to his daring to think and write and his diligent study. Among them, scripts such as "Who is the Benefactor," "A Crippled Old Woman," "Family Happiness," and "Debate Meeting" have become excellent plays promoted throughout the county.

The reason why the mass cultural and artistic creation activities in Hebei Province have developed so vigorously is not accidental. This is due to the personal leadership of the Party committees at all levels in this work. In their work, they specifically implemented the mass line, waged a tenacious struggle against conservative ideas, broke the superstitious and mysterious concepts about literary and artistic creation, and eliminated the sense of inferiority existing among the masses. Many county and township Party committee secretaries personally took charge and started writing themselves, which encouraged the creative enthusiasm of the masses and set off a creative upsurge of thousands of people writing and tens of thousands of people singing. Now, leadership over literary and artistic creation has become a part of the daily work of Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province. At the same time, literary and artistic creation has become a part of the daily life of the broad masses. The prosperity of mass literary and artistic creation has provided a large number of rich and varied poems and essays for Hebei Province's literary and artistic publications. For example, the "Factory History" special issue of "Xingang" in July, the "Poetry Special Issue" of "Mifeng" in July, and the "Revolutionary Struggle Story Special Issue" in August are all distinctive and welcomed by the broad masses.

It is precisely on the basis of such vigorous development of mass literary and artistic creation activities that the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to launch a mass literary writing movement of "Singing the Great Leap Forward and Recalling the History of the Revolution" throughout the province. This decision of the Provincial Party Committee has been enthusiastically supported by the workers and peasants throughout the province. Changli County is determined to challenge the advanced Shulu County and launch a nationwide writing movement of 2 million pieces. Xushui County established a mass writing movement and county chronicle compilation committee to lead the compilation of county chronicles, commune histories, and factory and mine histories, requiring the compilation of a 500,000-word county chronicle this year and the writing of 100,000 articles of various styles. Under the personal leadership of Comrade Lu Jie, Deputy Secretary of the Chengde Prefectural Committee, the Chengde Prefectural Committee vigorously launched a worker-peasant correspondence writing movement.

    书记动手全党全民办文艺
    河北省群众文艺大发展
    本报讯　在工农业生产全面跃进的形势下，河北省的群众性的文艺创作，也像其他省一样遍地开花。像天津的工人写“工厂史”的活动，束鹿、遵化、沙河、怀来的民歌、壁画的创作活动，昌黎的歌舞、曲艺、美术的创作，怀安的剧本、鼓词、快板、歌曲的创作，都形成了群众性的运动。四十万人口的束鹿县，就有了四千三百一十九个创作小组，二十二万三千多人的创作大军。仅从今年1月到8月，就创作了将近九十四万件的各种样式的文艺作品，这是群众文艺活动空前未有的繁荣景象。
    在这种蓬勃发展的群众性文艺创作运动里，涌现出大批有才能的工农作者。例如天津棉纺四厂的文艺组，就根据现实生活题材，创作了几十种各式各样的文艺作品，自编自演，对工人群众的自我教育，起了很大的作用。昌黎两山乡一个乡就有六十多名报刊通讯员，从去年6月到现在，共向各报刊投稿五百六十多篇，刊出了三百五十多篇。怀安县崛仑屯一个只认识五百多个字的农民作者李生禄，由于敢想敢写，刻苦钻研，在半年多的时间内，写出了五个剧本。其中“谁是恩人”、“一个拐大娘”、“全家乐”、“辩论会上”等剧本，成为全县推广的优秀剧目。
    河北省的群众文艺创作活动，所以能够这样蓬勃地发展，并不是偶然的。这是由于各级党委亲自领导了这个工作。在工作中具体贯彻了群众路线，同保守思想进行了顽强的斗争，打破了对于文艺创作的迷信神秘观念，消除了群众中间存在的自卑感。许多县、乡党委书记都亲自挂帅，亲自动手搞创作，这就鼓舞了群众的创作情绪，掀起了千人编、万人唱的创作热潮。现在，对文艺创作的领导，已经成为河北省各级党委日常工作的一部分，同时，文艺创作也成了广大群众日常生活的一部分。群众文艺创作的繁荣，为河北省的文艺刊物提供了大量的内容丰富、风格多样的诗歌、散文。例如“新港”七月号的“工厂史”特辑，“蜜蜂”七月号的“诗歌专号”、八月号的“革命斗争故事专号”，都具有特色，受到广大群众的欢迎。
    正是在群众文艺创作活动如此蓬勃发展的基础上，中共河北省委决定在全省范围内，开展一次“歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史”的群众文艺写作运动。省委这个决定，已经得到了全省工农群众的热烈拥护。昌黎县决心向先进的束鹿挑战，开展二百万件全民写作运动。徐水县成立了群众写作运动和县志编修委员会，领导编写县志、社史、厂矿史，要求今年编出一部五十万字的县志，写出各种样式的文章十万篇。承德地委在地委副书记鲁杰同志的亲自领导下，大力开展了工农通讯写作运动。
