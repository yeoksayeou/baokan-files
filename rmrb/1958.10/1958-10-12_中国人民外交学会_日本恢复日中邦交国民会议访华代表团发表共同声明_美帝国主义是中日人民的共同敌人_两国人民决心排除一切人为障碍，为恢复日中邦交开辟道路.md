Xinhua News Agency, 11th. The full text of the joint statement of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Relations Visiting Delegation is as follows:

The Japan National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Relations Visiting Delegation, at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, attended the National Day celebrations of the People's Republic of China, witnessed the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of China's socialist construction at an unimaginable speed, and saw the Chinese people resolutely defend their territory, oppose imperialist aggression, and unite with peace-loving people around the world to open up a new era of peaceful coexistence. The delegation was deeply moved by the spirit of the Chinese people.

The Visiting Delegation deeply felt that, in the current situation of Sino-Japanese relations, it is necessary to establish a new and correct relationship of unity between the people of the two countries. The Visiting Delegation also expressed the following attitude on this matter.

The struggle of the people of China and Japan against imperialism is the foundation of the unity of the people of China and Japan. In the past, the Japanese people failed to prevent Japanese imperialism from launching a war of aggression against the Chinese people, and the Visiting Delegation expresses its deep apology to the Chinese people. At present, the Kishi Nobusuke government is following American imperialism, antagonizing the Chinese people, and is moving towards the path of reviving imperialism, which must be resolutely opposed.

At present, the struggle of the people of Asia and Africa against colonialism and in defense of peace based on the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and the support of socialist countries for this struggle, have struck at the imperialist war provocations and the ambition to suppress the freedom of all nations, promoted the cause of liberation of all nations in the world, and opened up a new era for the realization of lasting world peace on the basis of freedom and equality. Only by fighting against the reactionary policies of American imperialism and the Kishi Nobusuke government, striving for Japan's democracy and independence, and striving for Japan's peaceful coexistence with Asian nations, is it the only way for the Japanese nation living in the new era to seek prosperity. The unity of the people of China and Japan established through such efforts by the Japanese people will not only be conducive to the normalization of relations between China and Japan, but will also contribute to peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs expresses its full support for the above opinions.

Starting from the above-mentioned standpoint, the Visiting Delegation discussed the situation in the Taiwan Strait and various issues facing the people of China and Japan with the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and reached complete agreement on the following points:

	(1) The current war crisis in the Taiwan Strait region is entirely caused by the provocative actions of American imperialism's aggression. The United States has concentrated a large number of troops in the Taiwan Strait region, and colluded with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek clique of the Chinese people to occupy China's inalienable territory of Taiwan and Penghu, and further attempted to expand its scope of aggression to the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, conducting military provocations against the People's Republic of China.

    Liberating Jinmen and Mazu, and liberating Taiwan and Penghu are all China's internal affairs. The Chinese people have the right to liberate these places according to their own will, and no foreign country can interfere. The United States' attempt to maintain the status quo in this region or to submit the issue of the ownership of Taiwan and other islands to the United Nations is an act of infringing upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and violating the United Nations Charter. Attempts to make "Taiwan independent" or to place it under the trusteeship of the United Nations, as well as the ambition of some Japanese people to annex Taiwan, are all futile attempts to reverse the wheels of history.

    The Visiting Delegation fully supports the just struggle of the Chinese people and demands that the United States troops immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

	(2) The United States is using the US military bases in Okinawa and other places in Japan to take military action against China, and the Kishi Nobusuke government is following the United States' war policy, adopting an increasingly blatant hostile attitude towards China, intensifying the promotion of Japan's nuclear armament, and colluding with the corrupt forces in Asia—the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee cliques—in an attempt to undermine Asian unity and establish an anti-communist military alliance.

    In view of the fact that the US military's presence in Japan not only infringes upon Japan's sovereignty and oppresses the Japanese people, but also is the source of threats to peace in Asia, the Visiting Delegation demands the abolition of the Japan-US Security Treaty and demands the withdrawal of the US military from Japanese territory, including Okinawa. The Visiting Delegation advocates the immediate abolition of the so-called "Japan-China Treaty" that colludes Japan with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek clique of the Chinese people, which is directly hindering the normalization of relations between China and Japan.

    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs completely supports the Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace.

	(3) American imperialism, which threatens peace in Asia and the world, is the common enemy of the people of China and Japan. Just as the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is beneficial to the Japanese people, the Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace is also beneficial to the Chinese people. The people of China and Japan should further strengthen mutual support in the struggle against imperialism. The people of China and Japan are determined to eliminate all artificial obstacles, resolutely oppose the conspiracy of two Chinas, strengthen friendly cooperation, and pave the way for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China.

    At present, the imperialist forces are already at the end of their rope. With the concerted efforts of all peace-loving countries and people in the world, American imperialism will have to retreat again and again and become increasingly isolated.

    There is no doubt that the resolute struggle of the people of China and Japan will surely be victorious.

    签字以后，双方敬酒热烈祝贺。
    新华社11日讯　中国人民外交学会和日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团的共同声明，全文如下：
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团应中国人民外交学会的邀请参加了中华人民共和国国庆典礼，看到中国的社会主义建设正以难以想像的速度全面大跃进，看到中国人民坚决保卫自己的领土，反对帝国主义的侵略，并且同全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致开辟着和平共处的新时代，对于中国人民的这种气概深受感动。
    访华代表团深切地感到，在中日关系的当前情况下，有必要在两国人民中间建立起新的正确的团结关系。访华代表团并且就此表明了如下态度。
    中日两国人民反对帝国主义的斗争，乃是中日两国人民团结的基础。过去日本人民未能制止日本帝国主义对中国人民发动侵略战争，访华代表团向中国人民深深表示歉意。目前岸信介政府又追随美帝国主义，敌视中国人民，并且正在走向复活帝国主义的道路，这是必须予以坚决反对的。
    目前亚非各国人民根据万隆会议精神进行反殖民主义和保卫和平的斗争以及社会主义国家对这一斗争的支援，打击了帝国主义的战争挑衅和压制各民族自由的野心，推动了世界各民族的解放事业，并为在自由平等的基础上实现世界持久和平开辟了一个新的时代。只有同美帝国主义和岸信介政府的反动政策进行斗争，为实现日本的民主、独立，为争取日本同亚洲各民族的和平共处而奋斗，才是生活在新时代的日本民族求得繁荣的唯一途径。经过日本人民的这种努力建立起来的中日两国人民的团结，不仅有利于中日两国关系的正常化，而且将对亚洲和世界和平做出贡献。中国人民外交学会对上述意见表示完全支持。
    访华代表团从上述立场出发，同中国人民外交学会讨论了台湾海峡局势和摆在中日两国人民面前的各项问题，并且就以下几点取得完全一致的意见：
      （一）目前台湾海峡地区的战争危机完全是由于美帝国主义的侵略的挑衅行为所造成的。美国在台湾海峡地区集中了大量兵力，并同中国人民的叛徒蒋介石集团勾结在一起，霸占中国不可分割的领土台湾、澎湖，并且进而企图扩大它的侵略范围到金门和马祖等沿海岛屿，对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅。
    解放金门和马祖，解放台湾和澎湖都是中国的内政，中国人民有权按照自己的意志解放这些地方，任何外国都不能加以干涉。美国企图在此地区维持现状或者把台湾和其他岛屿的归属问题提交联合国，是侵犯中国主权和领土完整、违反联合国宪章的行为。企图使“台湾独立”或交由联合国托管以及日本一部分人想并吞台湾的野心，都是妄想倒转历史车轮的徒劳的尝试。
    访华代表团完全支持中国人民的正义斗争，并要求美国军队立即从台湾和台湾海峡撤退。
      （二）美国正利用在日本的冲绳等美军基地对中国采取军事行动，而岸信介政府追随美国的战争政策，对中国采取越来越露骨的敌视态度，加紧推行日本的核武装，并和亚洲的腐朽势力——蒋介石、李承晚集团勾结，企图破坏亚洲的团结和建立反共军事同盟。
    访华代表团鉴于美军驻在日本不仅侵犯日本主权和压迫日本人民，而且是威胁亚洲和平的根源，因此要求废除日美安全条约和要求美军从包括冲绳在内的日本国土撤退。访华代表团主张立即废除使日本和中国人民的叛徒蒋介石集团勾结在一起的所谓“日华条约”，这个条约直接阻挠着中日两国关系正常化。
    中国人民外交学会完全支持日本人民争取独立与和平的斗争。
      （三）威胁亚洲和世界和平的美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。正如中国人民解放台湾的斗争对日本人民有利一样，日本人民争取独立与和平的斗争也是对中国人民有利的。中日两国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中，应该进一步加强互相支持。中日两国人民决心排除一切人为障碍，坚决反对两个中国的阴谋，加强友好合作，为日本同中华人民共和国恢复邦交开辟道路。
    目前，帝国主义势力已经日暮途穷。在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的一致努力下，美帝国主义将不得不一再退却，日益孤立。
    毫无疑问，中日两国人民的坚决斗争，必定取得胜利。
            1958年10月11日
