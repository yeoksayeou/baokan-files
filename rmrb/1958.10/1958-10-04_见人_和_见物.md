“Seeing People” and “Seeing Things”
Cheng Pu

In our ancient agricultural country, cultivation has been carried out for thousands of years. But today, the ancient land seems to have suddenly become young again, nourishing us with unprecedentedly abundant crops with a vitality never seen before, causing the yield of agricultural products to increase miraculously and rapidly. If asked where this miracle comes from, the straightforward answer is that, inspired by the rectification campaign and the General Line, hundreds of millions of people have been exerting their utmost efforts and marching bravely towards nature, changing the material conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil, which directly determine agricultural production, on an unprecedented scale, and fully tapping the potential for increased production in the land. As everyone knows, there have been many debates in the past year on how to treat objective conditions. Those "conditionists" who rely on the heavens for food, because they are accustomed to "seeing things but not people," always regard certain unfavorable conditions as the basis for agricultural production to only advance slowly and not leap forward, making themselves slaves of objective conditions. The attitude of the promoters, however, is just the opposite. They firmly believe that, under our advanced socialist system, relying on the collective efforts of the broad masses of people, some unfavorable conditions in agricultural production can be rapidly changed. The facts are indeed so. Now, the greatly changed material conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil have shown tremendous power in resisting natural disasters and promoting high-speed production increases.

Today, our farmers manage the land and crops based on the changed production conditions and according to new experiences and methods. This cannot but lead to a series of innovations in cultivation techniques and methods. For example, the density standards for close planting, the depth standards for deep plowing, the number of irrigations, the amount of fertilizer applied, and the proportion of various fertilizers used, etc., now not only negate the scales in people's past experience and habits, but also break through the provisions of modern agronomy. This should be said to be a revolutionary change. Why is there such a big change? It is because the conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil have changed, and the land's capacity for increased production has been greatly improved, prompting farmers to rapidly change the cultivation techniques and methods that have been followed for many years, so that the cultivation techniques and methods are adapted to the new material conditions. Precisely because of this reason, many strange and novel things have appeared in agricultural production in various places this year. For example, people can sit on highly densely planted rice seedlings without crushing the crops. The yield per mu of such rice is not several thousand catties, but tens of thousands of catties. Because a sweet potato field was plowed several feet deep and several layers of fertilizer were applied, several layers of sweet potatoes grew underground, with one layer after another being dug out. The yield per mu of such sweet potato fields is not tens of thousands of catties, but hundreds of thousands or even millions of catties. These wonderful new things are all closely related to the changes in water, fertilizer, and soil conditions. Some agricultural scientists have also discovered that varieties that were previously considered bad or degraded are now sometimes becoming high-yielding varieties. The reason is that in the past, the conditions of water, fertilizer, and soil were too poor, and the potential good qualities of these varieties could not be expressed; but now they suddenly get the best growing conditions, and diligent farmers seem to be encouraging them, saying: "You can have as much water and fertilizer as you want, eat and drink as much as you can! We have also prepared deep and soft underground palaces for you, you can stretch your feet as far as you want!" As a result, these crops grow and develop luxuriantly according to the wishes of the farmers, and suddenly show the advantages that have been hidden for many years. Only then do people realize that they are not low-yielding inferior species, but high-yielding superior species! Things are so abrupt and peculiar, seemingly unbelievable, but these are all facts.

It can be seen here how profound an impact the changes in material conditions such as water, fertilizer, and soil have brought to agricultural production, and how many noteworthy new problems. At the same time, this also makes us feel how complex and mysterious the inside of the ancient land is! Although people have relied on it for millions of years, we are far from having figured out its secrets and potential. If you want to ask: how many crops can grow per mu, how many ears can be formed? How much product can it produce in a year? I am afraid no one can answer.

Here we talk about the changes in water, fertilizer, soil, etc., and the potential for increased production of the land. All these are "things." In order to develop agricultural production at the highest speed, we do need to have a deeper understanding of these "things" and their interrelationships. If the "conditionists" are "seeing things but not people," then true dialectical materialists should be "seeing people and things," correctly understanding and arranging the relationship between people and "things." In developing agricultural production, the more profound and specific the understanding of the nature, role, and interrelationships of "things" such as water, fertilizer, and soil, the more effectively we can tap the potential for rapid increase in agricultural production. Are the "conditionists" who "see things but not people" really able to correctly "see" the great role of these "things" and their interrelationships? Not necessarily. Since they cannot "see people," their eyesight for "seeing things" is also very limited. Of course, at first glance, the "conditionists" attach great importance to objective conditions, and attach great importance to "things," but in fact, the objective conditions in their eyes are unchangeable, especially difficult to change quickly; the "things" they "see" are all rigid, static, fragmented, and unconnected "things," as if no subtle physical, chemical, and biological changes have occurred inside those "things" and between each other! It is precisely because of this that even though they have "seen" "things," they still dare not touch "things," and cannot rely on the wisdom and hands of the broad masses to create favorable material conditions and accelerate the development of production. Therefore, in a strict sense, the "conditionists" have neither "seen people" nor "seen things."

Agricultural production is a fierce struggle between millions of people and nature. To win any great victory in this struggle, it is necessary to emphasize "seeing people," that is, to fully estimate the role of people, fully发挥 [fā huī - give full play to] the inexhaustible wisdom and strength of the people, and use organized forces to fiercely attack nature. At the same time, it is also necessary to "see things," that is, to correctly understand and发挥 [fā huī - give full play to] the role and interaction of various material conditions, constantly study the objective laws of the struggle for production, and constantly accumulate experience in the struggle for production. In this way, with each victory in the struggle, we can explore the secrets of nature step by step, and we can extract more and more wealth from nature.

    “见人”和“见物”
    程浦
    在我们这个古老的农业国里，耕作已经进行了几千年，可是到了今天，古老的土地似乎忽然变得年青起来，它以从来没有的充沛的活力为我们哺养了空前丰盛的庄稼，使农产品的产量神话般地飞快地增长起来了。若问这个奇迹从何而来？直截地说，就是因为亿万人民在整风和总路线的鼓舞下，鼓足干劲，向大自然英勇进军，以空前的规模，改变了直接决定农业生产的水肥土等物质条件，充分地发掘了土地的增产潜力。大家知道，在如何对待客观条件的问题上，一年来曾经有过不少的争论。那些靠天吃饭的“条件论者”，因为惯于“见物不见人”，总是把某些不利条件看成是农业生产只能缓进不能跃进的根据，使自己成为客观条件的奴隶。而促进派的态度却恰恰相反，他们坚决认为，在我们的先进的社会主义制度下，依靠广大人民的集体努力，可以迅速改变农业生产的某些不利条件。事实果然如此，现在，大大改变了的水肥土等物质条件，已经在抗御自然灾害和促进高速度增产事实上显示了巨大的威力。
    今天我们的农民就是根据已经变化了的生产条件，按照新的经验和方法去管理土地和庄稼。这就不能不引起耕作技术和方法的一系列的革新。比如密植的密度标准、深耕的深度标准、灌溉次数、施肥量和各种肥料施用比例等等，现在不但否定了人们以往的经验和习惯里的尺度，而且突破了现代农艺学上的规定。这应该说是一个带有革命性的变化。为什么会有这么大的变化？就是因为水肥土等条件改变了，土地的增产能力大大提高了，促使农民迅速改变多少年来的沿袭的耕作技术和方法，使耕作技术、方法和新的物质条件相适应。正因为这个原故，今年各地的农业生产中就出现了许多看来很奇怪的新鲜事。例如，人可以坐在高度密植的水稻禾苗上而压不坏庄稼。这样的水稻亩产不是几千斤，而是几万斤。一块甘薯田由于耕了几尺深、上了几层肥料，地下竟结出几层甘薯，挖出一层又是一层。这样的甘薯田亩产不是几万斤，而是几十万斤甚至上百万斤。这些奇妙的新鲜事都与水肥土等条件的变化有极密切的关系。有的农业科学家还发现，过去认为不好的或者退化的品种，现在有的已经成为高产品种。原因是过去水肥土等条件太差，这些品种的潜在的优良品质表现不出来；而现在它们忽然得到了最好的生长条件，勤劳的农民似乎在鼓励它们说：“水和肥料要多少有多少，尽量地吃尽量地喝吧！还给你们准备了又深又松软的地下宫殿，你们的脚愿意伸多远就伸多远吧！”于是，这些庄稼就按照农民的意愿丰满地生长发育起来，一下子把潜藏了多少年的优点都表现了出来。这时人们才发现它们原来不是低产的劣种，而是高产的良种啊！事情就是这样突兀奇特，似乎令人难以置信，然而这却都是事实。
    这里可以看出，水肥土等物质条件的变化，给农业生产带来了多么深广的影响和多么值得注意的新问题。同时这也使我们感到，古老的土地的内部是一个多么复杂而奥妙的世界！虽然人们已经依靠它生存了千百万年，然而关于它的秘密和潜力，我们远还没有摸清。如果要问：一亩地究竟能长多少棵庄稼、结多少穗？它一年能出产多少产品？恐怕谁也答不上来。
    这里谈到水、肥料、土壤等等的变化，谈到了土地的增产潜力，所有这些，都是“物”。为了以最高的速度发展农业生产，我们的确需要更深刻地认识一下这些“物”及其相互关系。如果说“条件论者”是“见物不见人”，那么真正的辩证唯物主义者应该是“见人又见物”，正确地认识和安排人和“物”之间的关系。在发展农业生产方面，对于水、肥料、土壤等等这些“物”的性质、作用和它们的相互联系认识得越深刻、越具体，就越能更有效地挖掘出农业迅速增产的潜力。“见物不见人”的“条件论者”是不是真正能够正确“见”到这些“物”的巨大作用及其相互关系了呢？不见得。既然他们不能“见人”，那末他们“见物”的眼力也就很有限。当然乍一看来，“条件论者”很重视客观条件，很重视“物”，可是实际上他们眼中的客观条件，是不能改变，尤其很难迅速改变的；他们所“见”的“物”，都是僵死的、静止的、支离破碎而互不联系的“物”，似乎那些“物”的内部和彼此之间并没有发生任何物理的、化学的和生物学的微妙变化！正是因此，他们才“见”了“物”，仍然不敢去触动“物”，不能依靠广大群众的智慧和双手去创造有利的物质条件，加速生产的发展。所以在严格的意义上讲，“条件论者”是既没有“见人”，也没有“见物”。
    农业生产是千百万人和自然界之间的剧烈斗争。在这场斗争中赢得任何一个巨大胜利，都必须强调“见人”，即充分估计人的作用，充分发挥人民群众的无穷无尽的智慧和力量，运用有组织的力量去向大自然奋力冲击。同时也要“见物”，即正确地认识和发挥各种物质条件的作用及其相互作用，不断地研究生产斗争的客观规律，不断积累生产斗争的经验。这样，随着每一次斗争的胜利，我们就能一步一步地探索到自然界的秘密，就能向自然索取越来越多的财富。
