    The Great Festival of the Liberated Chinese People
    By Antonov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Union in China
    Today, the great Chinese people are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This day fills all honest and progressive people throughout the world, especially the Soviet people who have always regarded the Chinese people as loyal and reliable friends and brothers, with joy and excitement.
    The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the Chinese people's regime once again proved to the world the triumph of Marxism-Leninism and marked the entry of a new, powerful socialist fortress—the People's Republic of China with its 600 million people—onto the stage of history. This victory was also a heavy blow to the capitalist system, which is already decadent, declining, and must be replaced by a higher socialist social system.
    The great Lenin closely watched the development of the progressive democratic movement when it began to emerge in China, and he was convinced that the Chinese revolution would inevitably triumph. He predicted that the imperialist forces that had ruled China for many years would be utterly defeated. More than forty years ago, Lenin wrote, "No matter what the fate of the great Chinese Republic, which is now being gnawed at by various 'civilized' jackals, no force in the world can restore the old system of serfdom in Asia, can wipe out the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of the people in China and other Asian and semi-Asian countries."
    These inspiring words of Lenin are filled with infinite confidence in the inexhaustible strength and revolutionary vitality of the Chinese people. Today, these words have special significance when American imperialism, having failed to draw the necessary lessons from the recent past, is once again infringing upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's China, flaunting its power on the Chinese border, and carrying out various military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area.
    Blinded by hatred for the new social system, the American imperialists are unwilling to understand this obvious and undeniable historical fact: the people's socialist China is no longer the feudal China of the past, to which one could speak in arrogant language, impose various conditions, and issue ultimatums.
    The People's Republic of China was established through years of revolutionary struggle by the outstanding sons and daughters of the talented and heroic Chinese people under the leadership of the experienced and battle-tested Communist Party. It is now a powerful bastion of peace and socialism in the Far East, and receives firm support from the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp in all respects.
    Comrade Khrushchev, head of the Soviet government, stated in a recent statement that any attack by imperialism on our great friend, ally, and neighbor, the People's Republic of China, is an attack on the Soviet Union. Faithful to our obligations, we will do everything possible, together with the People's China, to safeguard the security of both countries, the interests of peace in the Far East, and the interests of world peace. These words express the will of all Soviet people. For this reason, this statement has been warmly welcomed throughout our country and unanimously supported by Soviet workers, peasants, intellectuals, and soldiers.
    We have a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with our great friend, ally, and neighbor, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet and Chinese peoples and the interests of peace. American imperialism is even shamelessly using atomic weapons to intimidate the Chinese people. However, as Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his letter to U.S. President Eisenhower on September 19 this year: "Atomic blackmail against the People's Republic of China cannot intimidate us, nor can it intimidate the People's Republic of China. Those who are planning an atomic attack on the People's Republic of China should not forget that it is not only the United States that possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, as well as the corresponding means of delivering these weapons. If such an attack is launched against the People's Republic of China, then the aggressor will immediately be met with a due retaliatory strike with similar weapons."
    The working people of China are celebrating the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in a great political and labor upsurge, showing the world everything that can be created by diligent and talented people liberated from imperialist oppression. It is no exaggeration to say that every day of ordinary labor performed by ordinary Chinese people demonstrates the heroism of the masses and vividly proves the correctness of the Marxist principle that once an idea has grasped the masses, it becomes a great material force. All Soviet people, together with the Chinese people, are delighted with China's triumphant march on the road to socialism.
    In the past nine years, the Chinese people have restored the national economy destroyed by many years of war and successfully completed the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture. Now, having accumulated strength and experience, the Chinese people have launched a broad national movement to turn China into a powerful socialist industrial power in the shortest possible time.
    The Chinese workers and peasants, while ensuring the great leap forward in various sectors of the national economy and culture, have broken with conventions and the notion that various countries and peoples can only achieve a certain level of development within the limits of a certain historical period, with their unprecedented rate of development of industrial and agricultural production, and with their labor achievements. The vigorous development of the People's Republic of China has overturned many scientific dogmas and so-called theoretical principles put forward by bourgeois scholars and considered by them to be axiomatic.
    We are also delighted with the remarkable achievements made by the Chinese people in implementing a broad technological revolution. On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's first atomic reactor went into production. This shows that the latest achievements of human wisdom are serving China's socialist construction.
    When announcing the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural development will inevitably appear. The era when the Chinese were considered uncivilized has passed, and we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." Life and the objective facts that mark the current situation in China irrefutably confirm that Mao Zedong's statement is correct.
    Starting from the specific historical, national, and economic conditions of the country, the Chinese Communist Party has studied and utilized the experience of socialist construction in other countries, formulated and boldly implemented its methods of organizing state organs, managing the national economy and culture, and mobilizing the masses to solve the tasks of socialist construction. The rich experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people has promoted the further development of Marxism-Leninism and aroused great interest among all Soviet people in the People's Republic of China. In-depth study of this experience is one of the most important tasks of Soviet experts in their daily activities.
    With the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the friendship and cooperation between our two countries, the Soviet Union and China, has entered a new and higher stage of development.
    Our two friendly countries are taking concerted action on all the most important international issues, exerting a decisive influence on all aspects of international life. Our two countries are also thwarting the conspiracies of international reactionaries to provoke a new world war with an active foreign policy based on the struggle for peace and friendship among peoples.
    During these years, the economic, cultural, scientific, and technological ties between our two countries have developed and consolidated, which is a model of a new type of international relations established between socialist countries. The basis of this relationship is the strict maintenance of sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and the mutual desire to help each other in the fastest possible march towards socialism and communism. At the same time, the relationship between our two countries is based on the principles of true proletarian internationalism.
    The historic meeting between Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Khrushchev played a remarkable role in further uniting the forces of peace and democracy and strengthening the friendly relations between the people, the two countries, and the two parties. The content of the communiqué issued at this meeting fully reflects the thoughts of every Soviet person. The communiqué said: "The two sides decided to continue to fully develop all-round cooperation between the two countries, further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, further strengthen the unity with all peace-loving countries and peoples, and reached complete agreement on all issues discussed.
    The two sides are in complete agreement on the assessment of the tasks facing the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The unwavering unity between these two Marxist-Leninist parties will always be a reliable guarantee of the victory of our common cause."
    May the unity of our two countries and peoples last forever and continue to be consolidated!
    Long live the People's Republic of China, a loyal friend and ally in our struggle for the complete victory of communism, a powerful country of peace, democracy, and socialism!

    解放了的中国人民的伟大节日
    苏联驻中国临时代办　安东诺夫
    今天，伟大的中国人民在庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年。这个日子使全世界一切正直进步的人们，特别是一向把中国人民当作忠实可靠的朋友和兄弟的苏联人民，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中国革命的胜利和中国人民政权的建立，再一次向全世界证明了马克思列宁主义思想的凯旋，标志出新的、强大的社会主义堡垒——拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国，登上了历史舞台。这个胜利也是对那已经腐朽的、日暮途穷的、必须为更高级的社会主义社会制度所代替的资本主义制度的沉重打击。
    伟大的列宁当中国开始出现进步的民主运动的时候，就密切注视运动的发展，并且确信中国革命必然胜利，他曾预言在中国统治多年的帝国主义势力必遭惨败。四十多年前，列宁曾经写道，“不管各种‘文明’豺狼现在所磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国底命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除中国和其他亚洲国家和半亚洲国家中人民群众底英勇的民主精神。”
    列宁这些鼓舞人心的话，充满了对中国人民的无穷的力量和革命活力的信心。今天，当美帝国主义没有从不久的过去吸取必要的教训，重新侵犯人民中国的主权和领土的完整，在中国边境耀武扬威，并且在台湾海峡地区进行各种军事挑衅的时候，这些话具有特殊的意义。
    对新的社会制度恨瞎了眼的美帝国主义者，不愿意理解这个明显的、无可辩驳的历史事实：人民的社会主义中国，已不是可以对之用蛮横语言讲话、提出各种条件和最后通牒的过去的封建中国了。
    中华人民共和国是有才干的、英勇的中国人民的优秀儿女在经验丰富、经过战斗锻炼的共产党的领导下，通过多年的革命斗争建立起来的。它现在是远东和平和社会主义的强大堡垒，在各方面受到苏联和整个社会主义阵营的坚决支持。
    苏联政府的首脑赫鲁晓夫同志在不久以前发表的声明中说道，帝国主义对我国伟大的朋友、盟邦和邻国中华人民共和国的任何侵犯，也就是对苏联的侵犯，忠于自己义务的我国，将尽一切可能同人民中国一道来维护两国的安全、维护远东和平的利益和世界和平的利益。这些话表达了全体苏联人民的意志。正因如此，这项声明受到我国各地的热烈欢迎，受到苏联工人、农民、知识分子和军人的一致拥护。
    我们同我国的伟大朋友、同盟者和邻邦缔有符合苏中两国人民根本利益及和平利益的友好同盟互助条约。美帝国主义甚至卑鄙无耻地拿使用原子武器来恐吓中国人民。但是，正如今年9月19日赫鲁晓夫同志给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信中所指出的：“对中华人民共和国的原子讹诈既吓不倒我们，也吓不倒中华人民共和国。那些策划对中华人民共和国进行原子进攻计划的人不应当忘记，并不只是美国，而且另一方也拥有原子武器和氢武器以及相应的发射这些武器的工具，如果竟然对中华人民共和国发动这种进攻，那么侵略者就将立即遭到应有的、同类武器的反击。”
    中国的劳动人民群众是在巨大的政治和劳动热潮中来庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年的，他们向全世界表明，从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的勤劳而富有才干的人民所能创造的一切。可以毫不夸张地说，普通中国人从事的日常劳动的每一天，都表现了群众的英雄气概，且生动地证明了这样一个马克思主义原理的正确：思想一旦掌握了群众，就会成为巨大的物质力量。全体苏联人民和中国人民一道，为中国在社会主义道路上的凯旋进军感到欢欣鼓舞。
    在过去的九年当中，中国人民恢复了为多年战争破坏的国民经济，成效卓著地完成了发展国民经济与文化的第一个五年计划，而现在积累了力量和经验的中国人民，又开展了争取在最短时间内把中国变成强大社会主义工业强国的广泛的全民运动。
    中国的工人和农民，在保证国民经济与文化各部门大跃进的时候，以空前未有的工农业生产发展的速度，以自己的劳动业绩，打破了陈规和认为各个国家和人民在一定历史时期的限度内能够获得一定发展的观念。中华人民共和国的蓬勃发展，推翻了许多科学的教条和由资产阶级学者提出并被他们认为是天经地义的所谓理论原理。
    中国人民在实行广泛的技术革命中取得的卓越成就，也使我们感到欢欣鼓舞。在中华人民共和国国庆九周年的前夕，中国的第一座原子反应堆投入了生产。这说明，人类智慧的最新成就在为中国的社会主义建设服务了。
    毛泽东同志在宣布中华人民共和国成立时说：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”生活和标志中国现时状况的客观事实，无可辩驳地证实了毛泽东这一声明是正确的。
    中国共产党从本国具体历史的民族与经济条件出发，研究和利用其他国家的社会主义建设经验，制定出并且非常大胆地实行了它的组织国家机构、管理国民经济与文化的方法，以及动员群众解决社会主义建设任务的各种形式。中国共产党和中国人民所积累的丰富经验，促使马克思列宁主义有了进一步的发展，而且引起了我们在中华人民共和国的全体苏联人的巨大兴趣。深入地研究这个经验，是苏联专家日常活动的最重要的任务之一。
    随着中华人民共和国的建立，我们苏中两国的友好和合作进入了一个新的更高的发展阶段。
    我们这两个友好的国家，在一切最重要的国际问题上采取共同一致的行动，对国际生活的各方面产生了决定性的影响，我们两国并且以奠基于争取和平与各国人民友好的积极的外交政策，来粉碎国际反动派为挑起新的世界战争而策划的阴谋。
    在这些年中，我们两国之间的经济、文化与科学技术联系有了发展和巩固，这是社会主义国家之间建立的新型国际关系的典范。这种关系的基础是：严格维护主权、互不干涉内政和彼此都希望在最快地向社会主义和共产主义迈进中互相帮助。同时，我们两国之间的关系是建立在真正的无产阶级国际主义的原则上面的。
    毛泽东同志和赫鲁晓夫同志的历史性会谈，对于进一步团结和平与民主的力量、加强我们两国人民、两个国家、两个党之间的友好关系，起了卓越的作用。这次会谈所发表的公报的内容，完全符合每一个苏联人的想法。公报说：“双方决定继续全力发展两国之间的全面合作，进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结，进一步加强同一切爱好和平的国家和人民的团结，并且对于所讨论的一切问题达成了完全的协议。
    双方对于中国共产党和苏联共产党所共同面临的任务的估计完全一致，这两个马克思列宁主义的政党之间的不可动摇的团结永远是我们的共同事业胜利的可靠保证。”
    祝我们两个国家和人民的团结永世长存和不断巩固！
    在我们争取共产主义的彻底胜利的斗争中的忠实朋友和盟国、强大的和平、民主和社会主义的国家——中华人民共和国万岁！
