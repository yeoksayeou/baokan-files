    A Stone That Doesn't Sink to the Bottom of the Sea
    Chuān Liú

    When something disappears without a trace, people say: It's just like "a stone sinking into the sea!" Do all stones sink when thrown into the sea? Not necessarily.

    The usual notion is: no stone can avoid sinking in water, and all hard materials seem to be heavy. "Hardness" and "heaviness" are often linked together. However, we are gradually discovering that sometimes "hard" and "light" are not contradictory; fiberglass is an example of this. As for stones, there are some that can float on water and are as hard as a steel knife; this is pumice.

    Pumice can float on water because it has many cavities inside. Some people have calculated that these cavities sometimes account for as much as six-tenths of its volume.

    Pumice is often seen in bathhouses and is used to scrub feet. It is also often used as an abrasive material to grind metals, stones, wood, and so on. In the chemical industry, it is also used as a filter, dryer, and catalyst. However, its more important use is as a building material. Concrete made with pumice and cement is strong and light, and it is soundproof, heat-insulating, and resistant to cold. Shaanxi Province has already produced such concrete.

    Why does pumice have so many pores? It turns out that it is formed by the cooling of lava flowing out during volcanic eruptions. When the lava contains a lot of gas, it will cause gas bubbles to form inside the lava. After cooling, these become cavities, just like the many pores inside a steamed bun. Therefore, pumice can only be found in large quantities in areas with volcanic activity. So, obtaining naturally formed pumice is subject to certain limitations.

    Is there a way to make some rocks have hard and porous properties through artificial methods? Yes. At the Exhibition of New Achievements in Science and Technology, we can see a large brick floating on water. This brick is made by heating clay to over a thousand degrees Celsius. The high heat melts the clay, and the gas inside expands, creating many large pores, which increases the volume and makes the weight relatively lighter. In addition to clay, fusible shale, coal gangue, and the like can be used to manufacture this kind of brick. The cost is very low.

    After breaking the concept that hard things are also heavy things, we will undoubtedly be able to find more and more light and strong materials.

    不沉大海的石头
    川流
    一件事没有下落，人们说：真像“石沉大海”！石头都是扔到海里就下沉吗？不见得。
    通常的概念是：石头在水里没有不沉的，而且一切坚硬的物质似乎也总应该很沉重，“坚硬”与“沉重”常常连在一起。然而渐渐地我们发现有时“硬”与“轻”并不矛盾，玻璃钢便是一例。石头呢，也有能浮在水上的，而且硬得和钢刀差不多，这就是浮石。
    浮石能浮在水上，是因为它内部有许多空洞。有人算过，这些空洞有时竟占去它的体积的十分之六。
    在澡堂里常可见到浮石，那是用来擦脚的。它还常被用作研磨材料，去磨金属、石料、木材等等。在化学工业中，还被用来作为过滤器、干燥器以及催化剂。不过它更重要的用途是作为建筑材料。用浮石和水泥制成的混凝土坚固而轻，并且隔音、隔热、不怕寒冻。陕西省已制出了这样的混凝土。
    浮石为什么有那么多孔？原来它是火山喷发时流出的熔岩冷却而成。当熔岩中含的气体较多时，就会使熔岩内部形成气泡，冷却后便是空洞，好像馒头内部有许多孔隙一样。因此浮石只能在有过火山活动的地区大量找到。所以要想得到天然生成的浮石便受到了一定限制。
    有没有办法使一些岩石通过人工的方法也具有硬而多孔的性质呢？有。在科学技术新成就展览会上，我们可以看到：一块大砖浮在水上。这块砖是将粘土加热到一千多度烧制成的。高热使粘土熔融，内部气体膨胀产生许多大孔隙，因而体积变大，重量相对地变轻了。除开粘土外，像易熔页岩、煤?石等都可制造这种砖。成本很低。
    破除了坚硬的东西同时也是重的东西这种概念以后，无疑地我们将能找到更多更轻更坚固的材料。
