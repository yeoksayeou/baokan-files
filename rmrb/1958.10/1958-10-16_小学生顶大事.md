    Elementary School Students Take on Big Responsibilities
    In the Dongfeng Brigade of the Satellite People's Commune in Jishan County, Shanxi Province, there was a severe shortage of labor during the autumn harvest and planting season. By the beginning of October, only 50% of the autumn harvest and 30% of the wheat planting had been completed, making progress extremely slow. In order to complete the autumn harvest and planting tasks as soon as possible, the commune and school leaders decided to organize students to participate in the autumn harvest and planting, turning the fields into labor classrooms. All five elementary schools in the brigade, with over 550 students aged ten and above, 17 teachers, and some commune and team cadres, were organized into an autumn harvest and planting field assault regiment, divided into three battalions and twelve companies. The brigade instructor served as the regiment commander, the principal of the central elementary school as the deputy regiment commander, and the teachers as battalion and company commanders. Based on the farm work, they were further divided into three teams: wheat planting with seed drills, autumn harvest transportation, and grass cutting and land preparation. Each day before labor began, experienced farmers would teach techniques, and then they would act. The students were all highly motivated and full of enthusiasm during labor, singing while working, and achieving "three goods" and "four highs." The three goods were: good autumn harvest, good wheat planting, and good propaganda. The four highs were: high attendance rate, high morale, high efficiency, and high quality. From October 2nd to 5th, through the day and night efforts of all teachers and students, over 1,660 mu of autumn harvest had been completed, 1,020 mu of wheat planting assisted, 1,150 mu of land prepared, and 420,000 jin of grass cut. The students' active participation in labor greatly accelerated the autumn harvest and planting progress of this brigade. Within just a few days, the autumn harvest had been 90% completed, and the autumn planting 75% completed. The commune members said, "If it weren't for these kids, we wouldn't be able to finish our autumn harvest and planting even by the twelfth lunar month."

    小学生顶大事
    山西稷山县卫星人民公社东风大队，在秋收秋种中劳动力非常缺乏，到10月初秋收只完成50％，种麦只完成30％，进展极慢。为了早日完成秋收秋种的任务，公社和学校领导上决定组织学生参加秋收秋种，到田间去上劳动课。将全大队五个小学，十岁以上的五百五十多个学生，十七名教师和一部分社、队的干部，组成了一个秋收秋种野战突击团，下分三个营，十二个连队。由大队指导员任团长，中心小学校长任副团长，教员分任营、连长。根据农活又分为拉耧种麦、收秋搬运和割草整地三支队伍。每天劳动开始，先由老农传授技术，然后行动。同学们在劳动中人人斗志高昂，个个情绪饱满，一面劳动一面唱歌，并做到“三好”“四高”。三好是：收秋好、种麦好、宣传好。四高是：出勤率高、情绪高、效率高、质量高。从10月2日到5日，经全体师生日夜奋战，已收秋一千六百六十余亩，协助种麦一千零二十亩，整地一千一百五十亩，割草四十二万斤。学生们积极参加劳动，使这个大队的秋收秋种进展得很迅速。短短几天之内，秋收已完成90％，秋种已完成75％。社员们说：“要不是这伙娃娃，我们的秋收秋种到腊月都干不完。”
