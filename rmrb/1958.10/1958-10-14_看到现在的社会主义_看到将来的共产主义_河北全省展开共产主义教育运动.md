Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 13th: A communist education movement has unfolded across Hebei Province. The propaganda army thrown into this movement has reached several million people. According to statistics from Tianjin Prefecture and parts of counties in Handan and Shijiazhuang Prefectures alone, over 2.1 million people have been organized into propaganda teams. Local areas have not only fully utilized existing propaganda forms and tools, but some counties and communes have also mobilized the masses to engage in extensive airing of views, debates, and writing of big-character posters, forming a mass self-education movement through recollection, comparison, and discussion of future plans.

This communist education movement began in late August in conjunction with the people's commune movement. With the progress of the movement, the communist spirit of the broad masses has been greatly promoted. For example, in the massive effort to develop the iron and steel industry, the broad masses voluntarily contributed their bellows, large vats, bicycles and other tools to support the ascent of the iron and steel marshal. Communes and teams have also drawn the strongest labor force to first meet the needs of steelmaking and iron smelting. When Yangqiao People's Commune in Daming County encountered difficulties due to insufficient livestock when deep plowing wheat fields in Xisizhuang, Yuecun immediately took the initiative to send 210 head of livestock to provide support. "One for all, all for one" has become the code of conduct for the broad masses of advanced people.

In its instructions on deeply developing the communist education movement, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requested Party committees at all levels to implement the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses to further improve the communist ideological level of the masses. The tasks of this movement stipulated by the Provincial Committee are: First, clarify the communist future and strengthen the masses’ determination to take the socialist and communist road, so that the broad masses of cadres, Party members, and the masses will not only see the current socialism but also the future communism. Second, greatly promote communist and collectivist ideology, greatly break down individualist and departmentalist ideology, establish new interpersonal relationships, establish correct relationships between the individual and the collective, small public ownership and large public ownership, small collectives and large collectives, accumulation and consumption, establish new communist labor attitudes and attitudes towards socialist public property, and greatly improve the communist ideology and moral character of cadres and the masses. Third, through summarizing the experience of this year's Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest, educate cadres and the masses, establish the ideology of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward, and make full ideological preparations for a greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production next year. Fourth, carry out large-scale appraisals and inspections of grassroots cadres and Party members, especially appraisals and inspections since the establishment of people's communes. Through appraisals and inspections, thoroughly open up the situation in villages with backward production and politics, so that red flags will be planted in every commune and team.

Currently, Hebei Province is deeply developing this movement in conjunction with current production tasks such as autumn harvesting and planting. After the autumn planting, various localities will continue to focus on dealing with economic issues in the people's communes, set off a large-scale upsurge of airing views, debates, and discussions, and conduct Party consolidation, League consolidation, and commune consolidation. Then, on this basis, they will mobilize the broad masses of cadres and the masses to discuss and formulate next year's leap forward plan.

    看到将来的共产主义
    河北全省展开共产主义教育运动
    新华社天津13日电　共产主义教育运动已在河北全省范围内展开。投入这一运动的宣传大军已达数百万人，仅据天津专区和邯郸、石家庄两个专区部分县的统计，就组织了宣传队伍二百一十多万人。各地不仅充分运用了原有的各种各样宣传形式和宣传工具，部分县、社还发动群众大鸣、大放、大辩论和写大字报，通过回忆对比和讨论前景规划，形成群众性的自我教育运动。
    这次共产主义教育运动是在8月下旬结合人民公社化运动开始的。随着运动的进展，广大群众的共产主义精神已经大大发扬起来。例如在大办钢铁工业中，广大群众自动拿出自己的风匣、大缸和自行车等工具，支援钢铁元帅升帐。各社、队也抽出最强的劳动力，首先满足炼钢炼铁的需要。大名县杨桥人民公社西寺庄深翻麦地时遇到了畜力不足的困难，岳村立即主动抽出二百一十犋牲口去支援。“一人为大家、大家为一人”，已成为广大先进群众的行动准则。
    中共河北省委在关于深入开展共产主义教育运动的指示中，要求各级党委贯彻放手发动群众的方针，以进一步提高群众共产主义的思想水平。省委规定的这一运动的任务是：一、明确共产主义前途，坚定群众走社会主义、共产主义道路的决心，使广大干部、党员、群众不但要看到现在的社会主义，还要看到将来的共产主义。二、大立共产主义、集体主义思想，大破个人主义、本位主义思想，建立新型的人与人的关系，树立正确的个人与集体，小公与大公，小集体与大集体，积累与消费的关系，树立新的共产主义的劳动态度和对待社会主义公共财产的态度，把干部、群众的共产主义思想和道德品质大大提高一步。三、通过总结今年大跃进、大丰收的经验，教育干部群众，树立全面大跃进的思想，为明年工农业生产更大跃进作好充分的思想准备。四、开展基层干部党员的大评比、大检查，特别是建立人民公社以来的评比检查。通过评比检查，彻底打开生产落后、政治落后的村庄的局面，作到社社队队插起红旗。
    目前，河北省各地正在结合当前秋收秋种等生产任务，深入开展这一运动。在秋种以后，各地继续以处理人民公社中的经济问题为中心，掀起大规模的大鸣大放大辩论的高潮，并进行整党、整团、整社，然后在这个基础上，发动广大干部和群众，讨论和制定明年跃进规划。
