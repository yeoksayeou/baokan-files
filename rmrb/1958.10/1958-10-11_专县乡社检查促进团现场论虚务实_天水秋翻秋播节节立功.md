To fully leverage the superiority of the People's Communes and overcome the current difficulty of labor shortage in autumn sowing, the Party Committees at all levels in the Tianshui Special Prefecture of Gansu Province have formed inspection and promotion teams to go deep into the field, adopt immediate and effective methods, and solve problems on the spot.

Starting in late July, all counties in the Tianshui Special Prefecture launched autumn sowing preparation work centered on deep plowing of the land. By the end of September, the entire prefecture had deeply plowed 3.2 million mu of land, accumulated more than 260 billion jin of fertilizer, prepared more than 100 million jin of improved seeds, and promoted more than 140,000 pieces of new-style sowing tools. The entire region, composed of farmers, government cadres, and commercial workers, formed an agricultural army of more than 600,000 people. After more than ten days of hard work, they had already sown 720,000 mu of wheat and more than 30,000 mu of rapeseed.

Since the start of autumn sowing preparation two months ago, the Tianshui Special Prefecture, counties, townships, and communes have universally organized inspection and promotion teams to go deep into the fields and on-site, adopting immediate and effective methods to discover and solve problems while promoting autumn sowing preparation work. During the inspection process, it was found that some commune cadres and masses attributed the slow progress of autumn sowing preparation entirely to "a shortage of labor, with no way to solve it." The inspection and promotion teams immediately moved rectification into the fields, put debates at the edge of the land, and conducted extensive debates on how to leverage the superiority of the People's Communes and overcome the problem of labor shortage. In reality, of the 1.8 million laborers in the entire prefecture, only 400,000 were invested in the steel production front. Therefore, as long as we muster enough energy, arrange things reasonably, and organize cooperation, the labor problem in autumn sowing work can be completely resolved. For example, after criticizing right-leaning thoughts such as "lack of fertilizer, insufficient labor," all members of the Jiajia Temple People's Commune in Tianshui County expressed: We will fight hard for half a month, one day as two, night as day, and vow not to rest until winter wheat is well sown, launching a "10,000 mu, 10,000 jin" movement with soaring enthusiasm. The Taijing People's Commune established a seven-determination system of fixing cadres, tasks, time, tools, livestock, personnel, and quality. The entire commune dismantled 150 old houses overnight, solving the fertilizer shortage, and organized three vehicle repair armies, repairing 800 vehicles overnight. Many People's Communes, based on the situation of large tasks, short time, and tight labor, organized professional teams and shock brigades to concentrate their efforts on completing tasks.

Some People's Communes, in the work of deep plowing, accumulating fertilizer, transporting manure, and sowing, have not yet broken through the boundaries of the original small townships, small communes, and small teams to carry out communist cooperation, resulting in manure not being able to be sent up the mountains and a shortage of people for sowing in the mountainous areas. After discovering these problems, the inspection and promotion teams immediately sought ways to solve them. First, they strengthened the unified leadership of the commune, determined secretaries and directors specifically in charge of agriculture, conducted land line-ups, concentrated the use of labor and tools, and implemented a system of assigning responsibility by area with fixed quality, quantity, and time. At the beginning of the establishment of the Bailong People's Commune in Dangchang County, because there was little labor, manure could not be transported to the land, and there were not enough seed drills. With the help of the inspection and promotion team, they concentrated 1,400 laborers and all sowing tools from the entire commune (three townships) and launched a large-scale collaboration, transporting manure and sowing the 25,000 mu of winter wheat land in the order of "mountains first, plains later, distant first, near later, shady slopes first, sunny slopes later," with rapid progress, sowing 3,000 mu per day. At the same time, a roving acceptance team was formed to accept the work while sowing, not only completing the originally planned ten-day task ahead of schedule, but also ensuring the quality of cultivation, with all land deeply ploughed once, 50,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu, and 50 jin of seeds sown. In order to better tap labor potential, all localities reorganized the established canteens, nurseries, and sewing groups, so that male and female members could work in the fields with peace of mind, thoroughly liberating female labor.

On October 2nd, the Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the situation reported by the inspection and promotion team, determined: (1) Party committees at all levels should, in the spirit of "grasping industry with the left hand and agriculture with the right hand," take effective measures to strengthen the leadership of autumn sowing work. Cadres leading agricultural production at all levels should not only personally participate in productive labor, but also focus on grasping political and ideological work and carry out a communist education movement. (2) In addition to vigorously supporting the labor required on the steel production front, the basic construction projects of water conservancy and soil and water conservation should be suspended to focus on doing a good job in the current autumn sowing production.

    专县乡社检查促进团现场论虚务实
    天水秋翻秋播节节立功
    本报兰州10日电　为了充分发挥人民公社的优越性，克服当前秋播中劳动力紧张的困难，甘肃省天水专区各级党委组成了检查促进团，深入现场，采取立竿见影的办法，发现问题，就地解决。
    从7月下旬开始，天水专区各县便展开了以深翻土地为中心的秋播准备工作。9月底，全专区已经深翻土地三百二十万亩，积肥二千六百多亿斤，备好良种一亿多斤，推广了新式播种工具十四万多件。全区由农民、机关干部、商业工作人员共同组成了六十多万人的农业大军，经过十多天的苦战，已经播种了小麦七十二万多亩，油菜三万多亩。
    从动手准备秋播到秋种开始两个月以来，天水专、县、乡、社普遍组织检查促进团，深入田间，深入现场，采取立竿见影的办法，边发现问题，边解决问题，以推动秋播准备工作。在检查过程中，发现有些社干部和群众把秋播准备的迟缓现象，完全说成是“劳力少，没办法”，检查促进团立即将整风搬进田间，把辩论摆到地头，对怎样发挥人民公社优越性，克服劳力紧张的问题，进行了大争大辩。实际上，全专区一百八十万个劳动力，投入钢铁战线的仅有四十万人。因此，只要鼓足干劲、合理安排和组织协作，秋播工作的劳力问题，完全可以得到解决。例如天水县贾家寺人民公社在批判了“缺肥料，劳力不足”等右倾思想以后，全体社员表示：苦战半月，一天当两天，黑夜当白天，种不好冬麦誓不休，以冲天的干劲开展了一个“万亩万斤”运动。太京人民公社建立了定干部、定任务、定时间、定工具、定牲畜、定人员、定质量的七定制度，全社一夜拆旧房一百五十间，解决了缺肥困难，并组织三个车辆检修大军，连夜修车八百辆。许多人民公社根据任务大、时间短和劳力紧张的情况，组织了专业队和突击队，集中力量完成任务。
    有些人民公社，在深耕积肥运粪和播种工作中，尚未突破原有小乡、小社、小队的界限进行共产主义协作，以致造成有肥送不上山和山区播种缺人的现象。检查促进团发现这些问题以后，立即设法解决。首先加强公社的统一领导，确定专管农业的书记和主任，进行土地排队，集中使用劳力和工具，实行定质、定量、定时的分片负责制度。宕昌县白龙人民公社在建社之初，因为劳力少，粪运不到地里，耧也不够用。在检查促进团的帮助下，集中了全公社（三个乡）的一千四百个劳动力和全部播种工具，展开了大协作，把二万五千亩的冬麦地，按照“先山后川，先远后近，先阴山后阳山”的顺序运粪、播种，进度迅速，一天播种三千亩。同时组成巡回验收组，边播种，边验收，不但使原计划十天播完的任务提前完成，而且保证了耕作质量，全部土地深耕一遍，每亩施底肥五万斤，下籽五十斤。各地为了更好地挖掘劳动潜力，重新整顿了已经建立的食堂、托儿所、缝纫组，使男女社员安心下地生产，彻底解放了妇女劳动力。
    10月2日，中共天水地委又根据检查促进团汇报的情况，确定：（1）各级党委应本着“左手抓工业，右手抓农业”的精神，采取有效措施，加强秋播工作的领导，领导农业生产的各级干部一面要亲自参加生产劳动，一面要着重抓政治思想工作，开展共产主义教育运动。（2）除大力支援钢铁战线上所需的劳力外，把水利、水土保持的基本建设工程暂停下来，全力搞好当前秋播生产。　（翟其寅）
