    The Hua Mulan Battle Camp
    By the Communications Group of the Xuchang County Party Committee Office
    We recently visited the "Hua Mulan" battle camp, which was engaged in deep plowing in the Jinmiao Management Area of the Zhenjian People's Commune in Xuchang. When we were still half a mile away from the battle camp, we were attracted by the propaganda display set up by the camp: passing through the Great Leap Forward gate, slogans were plastered along the tree-lined road, some of which read: "Work hard, work relentlessly, work desperately, and realize a yield of 50,000 catties per mu; mobilize the entire population, defeat American imperialism and liberate Taiwan!" "Plow five feet three inches deep, apply 300,000 catties of fertilizer, and next year the wheat piles will break through the sky!"

    Deserved Reputation
    The "Hua Mulan" battle camp has three companies, nine platoons, and twenty-seven squads, consisting of 310 women. Like the men, they act in a military manner, eating and sleeping on the ground, camping wherever they are. Since the establishment of the battle camp, not a single person has left their post for ten days and nights, and the combatants have passed their homes three times without returning. Combatant Wang Hua is 36 years old this year. After the land reform, she hoped to have a child. Last year, she gave birth to a little girl who is clever and lively. Wang Hua treats her like a precious pearl every day, not letting her cry even once. She did not participate in production for a whole year to take care of the child. After joining the battle camp this time, she has not seen her child for ten days. She said, "For the great turnaround of the land, I won't feel sorry even if the child cries three times. I won't withdraw until the task is completed." Because of her active labor, she has been rated as an advanced producer twice in a row. They are carrying out a competition with the men, with the slogan: "Work hard, work relentlessly, work desperately, and we will take the lead in deep plowing!" In the past few days, as a result of the competition, the women plowed two to three feet deep, averaging three-tenths of a mu per person per day, which is better than the men, who have fallen behind. Now, they have cooperated with the men's team to complete the deep plowing task of 2,460 mu of sun-dried fallow land and early autumn stubble, winning the first battle.

    In the Red Flag Platoon
    The Red Flag Platoon is an ordinary platoon in the first platoon of the second company. The entire platoon has 28 combatants. Because they were rated as a Red Flag four times, the entire camp awarded them the title of "Red Flag Platoon." Since then, this platoon has always maintained the glorious tradition, taking the lead in the charge during plowing and often helping sister platoons to complete tasks in crash programs.

    It was the evening of the eighth day of continuous fighting. Platoon Leader Wang Lian stuck her shovel in the ground, smoothed her sweat-soaked hair, and said loudly, "Comrades! Let's take a break!" Everyone seemed not to have heard her. Then she said another sentence, but still no one responded. Finally, young Cai Man said childishly, "Platoon leader, let's not rest! Otherwise, we will fall behind!" The platoon leader persuaded, "It's okay, production needs to have a rhythm. Everyone take a rest, and then we'll have dinner." Only then did they stop working. However, everyone immediately gathered together to discuss production. The older Shi Shuanni interrupted everyone and said worriedly, "How much did we plow today?" The platoon leader smiled proudly and said, "Now we have averaged more than three-tenths of a mu per person. If we make another leap forward tonight, we will break the four-tenths of a mu record, and the Red Flag will still be ours." Then, she asked everyone how they felt these past two days. Wang Gaiyun patted her soaked clothes to let them air out and said, "Turning over a shovel of soil is like digging out a root of Chiang Kai-shek. The more I work, the more energetic I feel." At this time, Jin Yuni sang a passage from the opera "Hua Mulan Joins the Army," which made everyone laugh heartily.

    A few small stars hung in the sky, and night fell. This was the beginning of a new battle for the women's battle camp. When the first red light appeared in the Red Flag Platoon, the whole slope lit up as if a light switch had been turned on. Combatant Wang Zhenni, holding a shovel, was the first to occupy the first ditch, and Wang Xiuzhi followed closely and fought side by side. These two young women have been working together and encouraging each other since they started plowing. Wang Zhenni's hands were blistered, so during the day, Wang Xiuzhi took the initiative to help her get food and wash dishes, and at night, she took care of her sleep and covered her with a quilt when she woke up. After 2:00 a.m., the camp headquarters sounded the retreat signal, and the combatants were all asleep, but Wang Zhenni and Wang Xiuzhi were still whispering under the starlight. Wang Xiuzhi said, "I must be a good daughter of Chairman Mao and learn to be ambitious." Wang Zhenni said, "In this land, we must explore experience. I won't get married until we produce 50,000 catties of wheat!"

    Camp Leader Wang Meirong
    Speaking of Wang Meirong, the camp leader of the "Hua Mulan" battle camp, everyone praises her as a model Party member. She often holds a meter in one hand and a whistle in the other, rolls her trousers up to her knees, her face is tanned, and she speaks straightforwardly and firmly. When the Party branch began to study deep plowing, she asked the branch to engage in deep plowing work. When the branch considered that some things in the commune could not be separated from her, she guaranteed to the branch that in addition to doing a good job of plowing, she would also do a good job of the commune's work. After the branch agreed to her request, she went everywhere to publicize the high-yield experience of Xiping's deep-plowed land producing 7,320 catties of wheat per mu, mobilizing women to put down their children, leave their homes, and go to the fields to plow. She took the lead in sending her little girl to the nursery and brought her luggage to the fields, inspiring the women of the entire management area to participate in the women's battle camp. In addition to taking the lead in plowing, Wang Meirong also had other work to do. Often when others rested, she didn't rest. When others slept, she worked. For ten days and nights, she was the same as ever. Her throat was hoarse, and the corners of her mouth were also rotten, but her spirit was always full.

    Once, Wang Meirong returned to the village to arrange work, and her lover, Wang Linfa, said, "If you don't rest for a while during work, what will you do if your body gets tired?" Wang Meirong was indeed a little tired for the past few days, but she couldn't sleep no matter how much she tossed and turned. The past flashed before her eyes. She thought of her father who died early, the poverty of her family, and being sold to Xiping County as a child bride. A young girl, like cattle and horses every day, could not eat enough, could not wear warm clothes, was beaten and abused, and suffered all kinds of torture. After liberation, the Party saved her life and cultivated and educated her, enabling her to serve the people. She has been rated as a model nine times in the past few years, and the Party has given her great honor. This year, she was also asked to visit the great capital. After returning, she participated in the provincial women's socialist construction activists' conference. At the meeting, Wu Zhipu, the first secretary of the provincial Party committee, taught everyone to engage in deep plowing and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year. Thinking of this, she said to herself, "I can't rest. I must do a good job of deep plowing and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year." (Originally published in Henan Daily)

    花木兰战斗营
    中共许昌县委办公室通讯组
    我们最近访问了许昌椹涧人民公社金庙管理区深翻土地的“花木兰”战斗营。当距战斗营半里多路的时候，我们被该营所摆设下的宣传阵势所吸引：穿过跃进门，沿公路林荫道旁贴满了标语，有的写着：“大干苦干拼命干，亩产五万要实现；全民总动员，打垮美帝解放台湾！”“翻地五尺三，施肥三十万，明年麦堆顶破天！”
    名不虚传
    “花木兰”战斗营有三个连、九个排、二十七个班，由三百一十个妇女组成。她们和男子一样，行动军事化，吃饭在地，睡觉在地，随地扎营。自从战斗营成立后，十天十夜没一个人离开岗位，战斗员三过家门不回家。战斗员王花今年三十六岁了，土改翻身后，就希望有个孩子，去年生了一个小女孩，长得精明伶俐。王花每天像手托珍珠一样，不让哭一声，为抱小孩整整一年没参加生产。这次参加战斗营后，十天没见小孩的面，她说：“为了土地大翻身，孩哭三声娘也不心痛，完不成任务不收兵。”由于她积极劳动，连续两次评为先进生产者。她们与男子开展着竞赛，口号是：“大干苦干拼命干，深翻土地咱占先！”几天来竞赛的结果，妇女翻二至三尺深，每人每天平均翻地三分，男子不及妇女，落后了。现在，她们配合男子队已完成了晒垡地和早秋茬两千四百六十亩的深翻任务，获得了第一个战役的胜利。
    在红旗排
    红旗排是二连一排的一个普通排，全排二十八个战斗员，由于四次评为红旗，全营就奖给她们“红旗排”的称号。此后这个排就一直保持着光荣传统，翻地中冲锋陷阵起尖兵作用，并经常帮助姊妹排，突击完成任务。
    是持续战斗了第八天的傍晚，排长王莲把铁锹扎在地上，用手理了一下汗水湿润了的头发，大声地说：“同志们！休息一下吧！”大家好像没听见一样。接着又说了一句，还是没人吭声。最后年轻的蔡满带着孩子气说：“排长，不休息！不然会落后的啊！”排长劝慰着说：“不要紧，生产要有个节奏。大家休息一下，就要开饭了。”这才停止了劳动。但是，大家马上就围在一起，讨论起生产来。上点年纪的石拴妮打断了大家的话头，不放心地说：“今天我们不知翻了多少？”排长自豪地笑着说：“现在已经每人平均三分多，今晚再一跃进，就会突破四分地的纪录，红旗还是咱们的。”接着，她问大家这两天有啥感觉？王改云用手掂了掂湿透的衣衫，好叫透点风，她说：“翻上一锹土，好比挖去蒋贼一条根，越干越有劲。”这时，金玉妮又给大家唱了“花木兰从军”征途中的一段戏，博得大家捧腹大笑。
    天上挂着几颗小星，夜幕来临。这是妇女战斗营新战斗的开始。当第一盏红灯在红旗排出现后，满坡像打开电灯开关一样，马上灯火四起，照亮了全坡。战斗员王珍妮手执铁锹，首先占据第一沟，王秀枝紧紧跟随并肩作战。这两个青年妇女，自开始翻地就共同协作，互相勉励。王珍妮的手打泡了，白天王秀枝就主动帮她盛饭、洗碗，夜间照护她睡觉，醒来给她盖被子。夜间两点后，营部吹了收工号，战斗员都睡熟了，王珍妮和王秀枝还在星光下窃窃私语。王秀枝说：“我一定要做个毛主席的好儿女，要学得有志气。”王珍妮说：“在这块地里，一定摸索出经验，不产五万斤小麦，不结婚！”
    营长王美荣
    提起“花木兰”战斗营营长王美荣，人人都称赞她是个模范党员。她经常一手拿着米尺，一手拿着哨子，裤腿卷到膝盖上，脸晒得黑红，说话爽朗坚定。党支部开始研究深翻地时，她就向支部要求搞深翻土地工作。当支部考虑到社里有些事情离不开她，她就向支部保证：除搞好翻地外，还搞好社里工作。支部答应她的要求后，她就到处宣传西平深翻土地小麦亩产七千三百二十斤的丰产经验，发动妇女放下孩子，走出家门，到田间翻地。她首先带头把自己的小女孩送到托儿所，带上行李到田间，启发了全管理区的妇女，都参加妇女战斗营。王美荣除带头翻地外，还有一些工作要做，常常别人休息，她不休息，别人睡觉她工作，十天十夜如一日，喉咙哑了，嘴角也烂了，可是精神一贯饱满。
    有一次王美荣回村安排工作，她的爱人王林发说：“工作一会不歇一歇，身体累坏了怎么办呢？”几天来，王美荣确实有些疲劳，可是翻来复去睡不着，往事一幕一幕地闪现在眼前。她想起了早年死去父亲后，家庭贫困，被卖到西平县当童养媳妇。一个幼小的女孩，每日和牛马一样，吃不饱，穿不暖，挨打受气，受尽折磨。解放后，党救了她的生命，又培养教育她，使她为人民服务，几年来曾九次被评为模范，党给她很大的荣誉。今年又叫她到伟大的首都去参观，回来后又参加全省妇女社会主义建设积极分子大会，会上省委第一书记吴芝圃同志教导大家，要搞深翻土地，争取明年小麦丰产。想到这里她暗自说：“不能休息，一定要搞好深翻土地，争取明年小麦丰产。”（原载河南日报）
