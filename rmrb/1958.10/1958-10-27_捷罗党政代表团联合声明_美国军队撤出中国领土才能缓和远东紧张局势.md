They believe that the main task at present is to fully support the unity and further development of the strength of the socialist camp.

The Chinese people have the inalienable right to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands by all means. The two delegations strongly condemned the U.S. policy of obstructing the easing of tensions in the Far East, and pointed out that the United States should bear full responsibility for the threat to peace and security in the Far East and the world. The two delegations expressed their support for the Chinese government's peaceful initiatives and expressed their belief that only the withdrawal of American troops from Chinese territory can truly ease tensions in the Far East.
    The statement also emphasized that both parties believe they have a responsibility to defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine and resolutely oppose various manifestations of modern revisionism, which is particularly evident in the program and policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The statement added that the Romanian Workers' Party and the Czechoslovak Communist Party will continue to wage a resolute struggle against any attempts to undermine the unity and cooperation between socialist countries and to cause division in the communist workers' movement.
    The statement also pointed out that the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Romanian government have invited a party and government delegation from Czechoslovakia to visit Romania, and the invitation has been accepted.
    In order to expand economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, the two sides concluded an agreement on the main issues of economic cooperation and exchange of goods from 1959 to 1965, and also concluded an agreement on cultural cooperation.
