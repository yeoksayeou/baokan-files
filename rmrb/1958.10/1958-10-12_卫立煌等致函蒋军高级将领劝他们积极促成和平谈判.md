Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Many former Kuomintang military and political personnel who revolted and are now studying at the Socialist Academy unanimously and enthusiastically supported Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots; believing it to be a good opportunity for Taiwan military and political personnel to break away from the control of American imperialism and make contributions to the motherland. On the 10th, they jointly wrote a letter to senior Chiang Kai-shek generals in Taiwan. Wei Lihuang, Zheng Dongguo, and others signed the letter.

The letter tells old friends in the Chiang Kai-shek army in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu: Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwan compatriots, you have probably all seen. You have been in Taiwan for nine years now. The feeling of missing your hometown and old friends is understandable. In the past few years, our motherland has leaped from a semi-colony to one of the world's great powers, and you also clearly know that the so-called "counterattack on the mainland" is a fantasy that will never be realized. US Secretary of State Dulles, in his recent talks, also had to admit this fact. Your situation is very tragic. You not only live on US aid but also rely on the protection of the US Air Force and Navy. Living under someone else's roof, you are at their beck and call. Everyone knows that the Americans are concerned with the Taiwan issue entirely for their own benefit. When they need you, they treat you as cannon fodder to fight against the people of the motherland, and when they don't need you, they abandon you at any time. Can any ambitious Chinese endure this kind of taste for a long time?

The letter also said: You should calmly think about why the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must suffer sacrifices? Besides peaceful negotiations, what other way out can you have? It can be said with certainty that only peaceful negotiations can allow you to return to the mainland to reunite with your family and friends and free you from the control of American imperialism, allowing you to be an independent and autonomous Chinese. Only peace talks can be worthy of your subordinates, allowing them to fulfill their wish to return home as soon as possible. Old friends: Peace or war? This is a matter of your life and death, honor and disgrace. For your own sake, for the sake of your children and grandchildren, and for the sake of the people of Taiwan, we hope that you can actively promote peace negotiations. Relatives and friends on the mainland are waiting for you! We hope that under the call of patriotism, you will join the people of the motherland in driving American imperialism out of Taiwan.

    卫立煌等致函蒋军高级将领劝他们积极促成和平谈判
    新华社11日讯　在社会主义学院学习的许多起义的原国民党军政人员，在座谈彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书时，一致热烈拥护；认为这是台湾军政人员摆脱美帝国主义控制，为祖国立功的好机会。他们在10日联名写了告台湾蒋军高级将领的信。在信上签名的有卫立煌、郑洞国等。
    信中他们告诉在台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖蒋军的老朋友们说：彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书料想你们都看到了。你们到台湾已经九年了。思家乡、怀故旧的心情是可以理解的。几年来我们祖国已由半殖民地一跃而为世界强国之一，你们也明明知道所谓“反攻大陆”的幻想是永远不能实现的。美国国务卿杜勒斯在最近的谈话中，也不得不承认这一事实。你们的处境是很悲惨的。不仅靠美援过活，而且靠美国海空军保护。寄人篱下，俯仰由人。谁都知道，美国人对台湾问题是完全为了它自己利益，当需要你们的时候，把你们当炮灰来与祖国人民为敌，当用不着你们的时候，随时把你们抛弃。这种滋味岂是有志气的中国人所能长期忍受得了的？
    信中还说：你们要平心静气地想一想，为什么一定要使台、澎、金、马的军民遭受牺牲呢？除了和平谈判之外，你们还能有别的出路吗？可以肯定的说，只有和平谈判才能使你们回大陆与家人亲友团聚，才能使你们摆脱美帝国主义的控制，做一个独立自主的中国人。也只有和谈才能对得起你们的部下，使他们早遂还乡之愿。老朋友们：和乎？战乎？这是你们的生死荣辱的问题。为了你们自己，为了你们子孙，为了台湾人民，希望你们能积极促成和平谈判。在大陆的亲友正等待你们！盼你们在爱国一家的号召下，和祖国人民一道，把美帝国主义赶出台湾去。
