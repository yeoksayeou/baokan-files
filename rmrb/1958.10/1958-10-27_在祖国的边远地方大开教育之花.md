In the remote areas of the motherland, educational flowers are blooming.

Guangxi: Zhuang language literacy achieves great success, work-study programs yield abundant harvests.

Guizhou: Moving towards the goal of universal higher education in fifteen years.

Xinjiang: The fertile and beautiful lands of Tianshan, both north and south, bear the fruit of combining education and labor.

In the past, the Zhuang people of Guangxi did not have their own written language. With the care and help of the Party, the Zhuang language was created. In order to train teachers to promote the Zhuang language, the Guangxi Pavilion shows that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has established fifty-two Zhuang language schools. Currently, the number of people who have become literate through Zhuang language literacy programs accounts for 77% of young and middle-aged Zhuang illiterates. With a written language, the political and cultural life of the Zhuang people has been enriched, and production has also been promoted.

The physical products on display in the Guangxi Pavilion vividly reflect the achievements of schools at all levels and of all types in running factories on a large scale, engaging in large-scale steel production, running farms on a large scale, carrying out technical innovations, and conducting productive labor activities in combination with the characteristics of the schools. Some of these products have certain significance and utility in industrial and agricultural production and scientific research. The “Rauvolfia verticillata” (a perennial plant that can treat high blood pressure) researched by teachers and students of Guangxi Medical College is a rare medicinal plant in the world. It grows abundantly in Guangxi, but farmers only use it as a fence. Since the college launched work-study programs this year, it has begun to cultivate this plant on a large scale and conduct scientific research, and has already made it into a medicinal preparation. Teachers and students of Liuzhou Forestry School have successfully researched the comprehensive utilization of Masson's pine. The achievements of the Shaonian (Young Pioneers) Farm of Bobai No. 1 Middle School in grafting sweet potatoes with moonflowers and pruning trailing tomatoes have been praised and supported by schools at home and abroad. The "anhydrous ethanol" self-made by Guangxi Normal College has a purity of 99.85% and is already selling well at home and abroad. The 1,605 pesticide products made by teachers of Nanning Agricultural School in a chemical laboratory with simple equipment are very effective.

The "Red Scarf City" of Nanning No. 4 Middle School is a form of strengthening communist ideological education for children and carrying out work-study programs. Through the introduction of the exhibit model, visitors can learn about the various activities of the "Red Scarf City".

A large number of facts show that due to the development of work-study programs, the face of various schools has undergone fundamental changes. In addition to improving students' political and ideological levels and cultivating students' love for labor and working people, it has also improved students' health and academic performance. The better the work-study programs are carried out, the more significant the effects.

After Guizhou implemented the Party's education policy, it achieved great success in education. At present, Guizhou Province has eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the entire province, popularized primary school education, and is vigorously running various types of Red and Expert schools. At the same time, higher education and secondary education have also greatly developed. The people of the whole province and the vast number of educators are marching towards the Party's goal of universal higher education in fifteen years with soaring enthusiasm.

In recent years, national education in Guizhou Province has also greatly developed. For example, from 1950 to 1957, the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture developed a total of 2,011 middle and primary schools with 20,422 students; in 1958, it developed 7 colleges and universities with 870 students, and 4,598 middle and primary schools with 283,657 students. In addition, three minority languages, Miao, Buyi, and Dong, were created, and textbooks were compiled using them.

Under the strong leadership of the Party, schools have taken the combination of education and productive labor as the center, and have carried out fierce struggles against bourgeois ideology, achieving basic victories. Schools have run factories and farms on a large scale, producing a large number of new products, and students' academic quality and physical fitness have also been greatly improved. In the process of struggling with skeptics and opponents, Guiyang Industrial School overcame the difficulties of poor technology and equipment, and made the first all-gear lathe in Guizhou Province. Guiyang Normal College has built seven large factories, including steelmaking, ironmaking, oil refining, and machinery, which have all been put into production; their machinery factory has manufactured precision instruments such as Anderson cloud chambers, spectroscopes, and semiconductor rectifiers. Guiyang Medical College combines indigenous and foreign methods to make significant contributions to traditional Chinese medicine. They cooperated with an elderly Chinese medicine doctor, Grandma Lu, to cure incurable diseases - nephritis, and they also successfully trial-produced scientific instruments to help Chinese medicine diagnose and treat diseases - meridian measuring instruments, and produced cholecystography contrast agent - sodium tetraiodophenolphthalein. Students of Guizhou Agricultural College have diligently studied and cured pig asthma, which has always been considered incurable.

In terms of mass education, the focus is on introducing the first red banner in the leap forward of national education - the semi-farming and semi-studying private "Qunli Middle School". The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has eliminated illiteracy for a total of 1,323,688 people in the past nine years, basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. The number of students enrolled has increased rapidly. For example, in 1949, there was only one college student and two middle school students for every 20,000 Uygur people; in 1958, there were seven college students and 215 middle school students for every 10,000 Uygur people.

In this beautiful and fertile frontier, schools have built factories and farms on a large scale, and have launched work-study programs. Pastoral areas are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, supplemented by agriculture. Some herders have never cultivated the land for generations. Since the implementation of work-study programs, schools have opened up many pastures and wasteland as experimental fields or school fields. Herders say: "The students now are different from the past. They can go to school and work."

Xinjiang is a region rich in mineral resources. In Urumqi alone, some colleges and universities have established 94 factories, all of which are now in production, and plan to produce more than 300 products by the end of the year, including steel, petroleum, and cement. On the exhibition stand are displayed the ores mined by students, black crude oil, and the wired broadcasting station integrated controller designed and manufactured by teachers and students of Xinjiang University, which can enable one person to complete the work of three people. Xinjiang Mining and Metallurgical College produces 50-horsepower blowers, transformers, motors, distribution panels, pressure resistance testing equipment, radio remote controllers, electrolytic copper, etc. Xinjiang Petroleum College designed and manufactured a radio, amplifier, phonograph, and intercom four-in-one radio.

Xinjiang is a good place. Here, the flowers of the combination of education and labor will bloom all over the Tianshan Mountains, both north and south.

    在祖国的边远地方大开教育之花
    广西：僮文扫盲成绩大勤工俭学收获多
    贵州：向十五年普及高等教育的目标迈进
    新疆：富饶美丽的天山南北结下教育结合劳动之果
    广西僮族过去没有自己的文字，在党的关怀和帮助下，创造了僮文。为了培养推行僮文的师资，从广西馆可以看到，广西僮族自治区开办了五十二所僮文学校。目前僮文扫盲已经脱盲的人数，占僮族青壮年文盲77％。由于有了文字，丰富了僮族人民的政治文化生活，也推动了生产。
    广西馆内展出的产品实物，集中而生动地反映了各级各类学校大办工厂、大搞钢铁生产和大办农场、大闹技术革新以及结合学校特点进行的生产劳动活动的成就。其中有些产品在工农业生产和科学研究上都有一定的意义和作用。广西医学院师生研究的“萝芙木”（一种多年生植物，可治高血压），是世界上稀有的药用植物，广西大量生长，可是农民只用它作篱笆。今年该院开展勤工俭学活动以后，就开始大量培植这种植物并进行科学研究，已制成药剂。柳州林业学校师生研究成功马尾松的综合利用。博白一中少年农场的用月光花稼接红薯、番茄挂蔓剪枝等所取得的成就，得到了国内外学校的赞扬和支持。广西师范学院自制的“无水乙醇”，成分达到99.85％，已经畅销国内外。南宁农业学校教师在设备简陋的化学实验室中制成的一千六百零五农药，效能很好。
    南宁市四中的“红领巾城”是加强对少年儿童共产主义思想教育、开展勤工俭学活动的一种形式。通过展品模型的介绍，观众可以了解“红领巾城”的各项活动。
    大量的事实说明，由于勤工俭学活动的开展，各类学校的面貌都起了根本的变化。除了提高学生的政治思想水平，培养了学生热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的感情外，同时也提高了学生的健康水平和学习质量。勤工俭学活动开展得愈好的学校，效果愈显著。
    贵州贯彻党的教育方针后在教育事业上取得了巨大成绩。目前，贵州省已经扫除了全省青壮年中的文盲，普及了小学教育，正在大力举办各种类型的红专学校。同时，高等教育和中等教育也有很大的发展。全省人民和广大教育工作者正以冲天干劲向党提出十五年普及高等教育的奋斗目标迈进。
    几年来贵州省的民族教育也有很大的发展。如黔东南苗族侗族自治州从1950到1957年共发展中、小学二千零十一所，学生二万零四百二十二人；1958年又发展大专学校七所，学生八百七十人，中、小学四千五百九十八所，学生二十八万三千六百五十七人。此外，还创制了苗族、布依族、侗族等三种少数民族文字，并用它编写了课本。
    在党的坚强领导下，学校以教育与生产劳动相结合为中心，同资产阶级思想进行着激烈的斗争，已取得基本上的胜利。学校大办工厂、农场，生产了大量新产品，学生的学习质量和体质也大大提高了。贵阳工业学校，在同怀疑派、反对派进行斗争的过程中，克服了技术、设备差的困难，制成了贵州省第一台全齿轮车床。贵阳师范学院兴建了炼钢、炼铁、炼油、机械等七个大型工厂，现在已经全部投入生产；他们的机械厂制成了安尔逊云雾室、分光镜、半导体整流器等精密仪器。贵阳医学院土洋结合，对祖国医学作出重大贡献。他们同一位中医卢老太太合作，治好了不治之症——肾脏炎，他们还试制成功了帮助中医诊疗疾病的科学仪器——经络测定仪，制成了胆囊造影剂——四碘酚酞钠。贵州农学院学生刻苦钻研，治好了向来认为不能治疗的猪气喘病。
    在群众办学方面，重点介绍了全国教育事业跃进中的第一面红旗——半耕半读的民办“群力中学”。新疆维吾尔自治区九年来共扫除文盲一百三十二万三千六百八十八名，基本上消灭了青壮年中的文盲。在校学生迅速地增加。例如，1949年每两万多维吾尔族人中只有一个大学生，两个中学生；在1958年每一万维吾尔族人中就有七个大学生，二百一十五个中学生。
    在这美丽富饶的边疆，各学校纷纷大办工厂、农场，开展勤工俭学活动。牧区以畜牧为主，农业为副。有些牧民祖祖辈辈没有种过地，自从开展勤工俭学以后，各学校开辟了许多牧场荒地作试验田或学田。牧民们说：“现在的学生和从前不一样了，他们又能上学，又能劳动。”
    新疆是个矿藏丰富的地区。仅乌鲁木齐市一部分院校就办起九十四个工厂，现已全部投入生产，计划年底生产三百多种产品，其中有钢铁、石油、水泥。展览台上，陈列着学生们采的矿石、黑色的原油，还有新疆学院师生设计制造的有线广播站综合控制器，它可以使三个人的工作由一个人来完成。新疆矿冶学院生产的五十匹马力的鼓风机、变压器、电动机、配电盘、耐压实验器、无线电远方控制器、电解铜等。新疆石油学院设计制造的收音、扩音、电唱、通话四用收音机。
    新疆是个好地方，在这里，教育与劳动结合的花朵将开遍天山南北。
