Xinhua News Agency commentary

Under the strong condemnation of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, the American aggressor troops were finally forced to withdraw completely from Lebanon on October 25. At the same time, British aggressor troops are also being forced to withdraw from Jordan. This is a great victory for the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the Middle East and the people of the world, and another disgraceful failure for the moribund imperialism.

The withdrawal of US-British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan reminds people of the scene in 1956 when the British, French, and Israeli aggressor troops were forced to withdraw from Egypt. The aggressors ended in failure in both cases. The difference is that during the aggression war, the United States appeared superficially as a "peacemaker," while now it is notorious, revealing its true colors as an aggressor in broad daylight.

More than 15,000 American Marines and paratroopers, carrying artillery and tanks, who invaded Lebanon, finally had to retreat after staying in this coastal country for a full 100 days. This fully demonstrates the bankruptcy of the American "Eisenhower Doctrine" of aggression and the paper tiger nature of American imperialism.

The American pirate troops began invading Lebanon on July 15 this year, only one day after the people of Iraq overthrew the traitorous feudal dynasty of Faisal overnight. In his proclamation, US President Eisenhower said very hypocritically and shamelessly that the US sent troops to Lebanon to "maintain Lebanon's territorial integrity and independence" and "protect American citizens." The drunkard's intention was not in the wine. Many American newspapers and periodicals admitted that the United States fabricated excuses to send troops to Lebanon, not only to support the then-collapsing traitorous regime of Shamun in Lebanon, but also to strangle the newborn Republic of Iraq, and then destroy the United Arab Republic, trampling the vigorously developing national independence movement in the Middle East under its military boots. The imperialists also coveted the oil in this region. The New York Herald Tribune put it most bluntly: The victory of the Iraqi revolution "threatens the lifeline of the West—not only Iraqi oil, but also the oil of Kuwait, Iran, and even Saudi Arabia," so "the West must not allow this vein on its neck to be cut."

The armed aggression of the United States and Britain against the Middle East aroused a wave of angry protests from the people of the world. The socialist camp countries issued strong warnings to the US and British aggressors. From China and the Soviet Union to India and Indonesia in Asia, from Europe to South America, there were demonstrations and rallies everywhere, angrily demanding that the US and British aggressor troops immediately get out of the Middle East. Many Western countries, and even some "allies" in the North Atlantic Group, were unwilling to support this military adventure by the United States and Britain. The US and British aggressors were in an unprecedented embarrassing and isolated situation. American newspapers and well-known figures were forced to admit that the US-led invasion was "a tragic mistake" that put the US "in a terrible situation." Sulzberger once wrote in the New York Times that this armed intervention "happened in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons."

In order to get rid of the label of being accused of being "aggressors" and "executioners" of the people of the Middle East, the United States attempted in July to usurp the banner of the United Nations in the United Nations Security Council, using the organization of a so-called United Nations police force to legalize its occupation of Lebanon, but it was vetoed by the Security Council. Eisenhower also sent special envoy Murphy to Lebanon to carry out conspiracies.

The emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly convened at the request of the Soviet Union was held at the end of August. The meeting unanimously adopted the Arab countries' proposal requiring the rapid withdrawal of US and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan. Any excuses for the US and British aggressors to continue occupying Lebanon and Jordan were completely eliminated. However, after the resolution was passed, the United States continued to instigate the ousted Shamun group to create chaos in Lebanon, and also conspired to overthrow the newly established Karami cabinet, which pursued the maintenance of national interests, in order to prolong the US military's occupation of Lebanon. As late as October 9, the US State Department was still pinning its hopes on the emergence of the "unpredictable" chaotic situation it had created.

However, the firm stance of the patriotic people of Lebanon finally left the American aggressors with no opportunity to take advantage of.

The expulsion of the US and British aggressor troops from Lebanon and Jordan once again proves that the imperialist gunboat policy of the nineteenth century is no longer feasible. The East wind prevails over the West wind. The era of imperialism doing whatever it wants is gone forever. As the New York Times admitted, "all the armed forces of the United States and Britain combined cannot extinguish" the powerful national independence movement of the people of the Middle East.

However, this does not mean that the imperialist aggressors have resigned themselves to their failure and will stop their aggression against the people of the Middle East. Have not the agents and mouthpieces of American monopoly capital already offered advice to interfere in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries and undermine the national independence movement in the Middle East with "highly skilled diplomatic tactics" and political conspiracies? News shows that before leaving Lebanon, the American aggressor troops had smuggled a large number of weapons to the Shamun group and allocated a large amount of US dollars to Shamun for him to carry out activities. The United States has also sent a military delegation to Jordan, preparing to strengthen its control over Hussein's army. The supply of weapons to Israel by the United States and Britain is increasing. Conspiracies to undermine the unity of Arab countries are also being strengthened. The US Sixth Fleet is still cruising and spying in the eastern Mediterranean, continuing to threaten peace in the Middle East. This requires the people of the Middle East and the people of the world to be vigilant and strengthen unity. Do not forget that imperialists are imperialists after all. Let's see how they will act in the future!

### 美英侵略军不光彩的“撤退”

    美英侵略军不光彩的“撤退”
    新华社记者述评
    在中东人民和世界人民的强烈谴责下，美国侵略军队在10月25日全部被迫撤出黎巴嫩了。同时，英国侵略军队也正在被迫从约旦撤退。这是中东人民和世界人民反帝斗争的一个巨大胜利，也是日暮途穷的帝国主义又一次可耻的失败。
    美英侵略军队的撤出黎约，使人们想起英、法、以三国侵略军队在1956年间被迫撤出埃及的情景。侵略者们以失败告终是一样的，所不同的是，在侵略战争期间，美国表面是以“和事佬”的面目出现，而现在却是声名狼籍，在光天化日之下露出了侵略者的原形。
    一万五千多名带着大炮坦克侵入黎巴嫩的美国海军陆战队和伞兵，在这个滨海国家呆了整整一百天以后终于不得不退走。这件事充分地显示了美国“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略政策的破产，和美帝国主义的纸老虎的本相。
    美国海盗军队是在今年7月15日开始侵入黎巴嫩的，仅在伊拉克人民一夜之间推翻了卖国的费萨尔封建王朝之后一天。美国总统艾森豪威尔在发表的文告中十分虚伪和无耻地说，美国出兵黎巴嫩是“维护黎巴嫩的领土完整与独立”和“保护美国侨民”。醉翁之意不在酒。美国很多报刊承认，美国制造借口出兵黎巴嫩，不仅是要支持当时摇摇欲坠的黎巴嫩夏蒙卖国政权，而且还要扼杀新生的伊拉克共和国，进而摧毁阿拉伯联合共和国，把中东蓬勃发展的民族独立运动践踏在军靴下。帝国主义者还觊觎着这个地区的石油。“纽约先驱论坛报”说得最露骨：伊拉克革命的胜利“威胁着西方的生命线——不单是伊拉克的石油，而且还有科威特、伊朗以至沙特阿拉伯的石油”，因此“西方绝不能让这条脖子上的静脉被切断”。
    美英两国对中东的武装侵略，激起了世界人民愤怒抗议的浪潮。社会主义阵营各国向美英侵略者发出了强有力的警告。从中国、苏联到亚洲的印度、印度尼西亚，从欧洲到南美，到处都举行了示威游行和集会，愤怒要求美英侵略军队立即滚出中东。不少西方国家甚至是北大西洋集团中的一些“盟国”，也不愿支持美英的这种军事冒险。美英侵略者处于空前狼狈和孤立的境地。美国报刊和知名人士被迫承认，美国这次带头出兵侵略是“一个悲剧性的大错误”，它使美国“陷入了悲惨的境地”。苏兹贝格曾经在“纽约时报”上写道，这种武装干涉“发生在错误的地方、错误的时候，理由也是错误的”。
    为了摆脱被指责为“侵略者”和中东人民的“刽子手”的帽子，美国7月间企图在联合国安理会上盗用联合国旗帜，用组织所谓联合国警察部队为名使它侵占黎巴嫩的行为合法化，但是遭到安理会的否决。艾森豪威尔又派遣特使墨菲到黎巴嫩进行阴谋活动。
    苏联要求召开的联合国大会紧急特别会议在8月底召开。会议一致通过了要求美英侵略军迅速撤出黎巴嫩和约旦的阿拉伯国家提案。美英侵略者还想继续侵占黎巴嫩和约旦的任何借口都被解除无遗。但是，在决议通过之后，美国仍然继续在黎巴嫩嗾使被赶下台的夏蒙集团制造混乱，还阴谋推翻新成立的奉行维护民族利益的卡拉米内阁，以便延长美军对黎巴嫩的侵占。直到10月9日，美国国务院还寄希望在它所制造的“无法预料的”混乱局势的出现。
    但是黎巴嫩爱国人民的坚定立场，终于使美国侵略者无机可乘。
    美英侵略军队的被赶出黎巴嫩和约旦再一次地证明了，帝国主义十九世纪的炮舰政策是行不通了。东风压倒西风。帝国主义为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返。正像“纽约时报”所承认的，“美国和英国的武装部队全部合起来也无法扑灭”中东人民的强大民族独立运动。
    但是，这并不表明帝国主义侵略者已经甘心于它们的失败，会停止对中东人民的侵略。美国垄断资本的代理人、喉舌不是早已经献策，要用“高度的外交手腕”和政治阴谋来干涉中东国家的内政、破坏中东的民族独立运动吗？消息显示，美国侵略军队在离开黎巴嫩之前，已经把大量的武器偷运给夏蒙集团分子，拨给夏蒙大批美元供他进行活动。美国也派了一个军事代表团前往约旦，准备加强控制侯赛因的军队。美英供应以色列的武器正在增加。破坏阿拉伯国家团结的阴谋也在加强。美国第六舰队仍然在东地中海游弋窥伺，继续威胁中东的和平。这需要中东人民和世界人民提高警惕，加强团结。不要忘记帝国主义者到底是帝国主义者，且看它们今后怎样动作吧！
