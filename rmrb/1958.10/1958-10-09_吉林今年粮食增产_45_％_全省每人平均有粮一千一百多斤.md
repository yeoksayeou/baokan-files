Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th. According to preliminary statistics and estimations, the total grain output of Jilin Province this year (including soybeans) is expected to reach 14 billion jin, an increase of 45.8% compared to the actual output last year. The average yield per mu of grain crops is 237 jin, and the average yield per mu of soybeans is 154 jin. The average grain available per capita in the province is over 1,100 jin. Twelve cities and counties have achieved the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program, with average yields exceeding 400 jin per mu.

The cities and counties in Jilin Province that achieved yields of over 400 jin per mu are mostly located in the eastern mountainous areas. Changbai Korean Autonomous County, located in the Changbai Mountains, historically had an average yield of only about 80 jin per mu, but this year it leaped to 423 jin. Jiaohe County also has a relatively short frost-free period and previously failed to meet its grain production targets every year. Since the county committee recognized the natural characteristics, grasped the natural laws, and mobilized the masses to carry out many reforms in agricultural production, the situation has greatly improved. This year, the average yield per mu is 448 jin, making it the county with the highest single-yield in Jilin Province currently. The grain yield per mu in the western grassland areas has also increased significantly this year.

Since last autumn, Jilin Province's agricultural production has undergone rural rectification, which has greatly enhanced the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers. Significant progress has been made in areas such as water conservancy construction, increased application of manure, timely and early planting, drought resistance and moisture preservation, and strengthened field management. However, compared with the advanced provinces in the country, it still lags far behind. Grain production has not yet passed the test. Therefore, striving for a greater leap forward in grain production next year is a major political task for the people of Jilin Province. Currently, inspired by this year's bumper harvest, the vast masses of the province are actively launching a production upsurge centered on autumn harvest, deep plowing, and large-scale iron and steel production.

    吉林今年粮食增产45％
    全省每人平均有粮一千一百多斤
    据新华社长春8日电　吉林省今年粮食总产量（包括大豆）据初步统计和估算可达一百四十亿斤，比去年实产增加45.8％。平均粮食作物亩产二百三十七斤，大豆亩产一百五十四斤。全省每人平均可有粮食一千一百多斤。实现全国农业发展纲要指标，平均亩产四百斤以上的市、县已有十二个。
    吉林省今年获得亩产四百斤以上的市县，大部分属于东部山区。位于长白山区的长白朝鲜族自治县，历来平均亩产只有八十几斤，今年飞跃到四百二十三斤。蛟河县也是个无霜期较短的县份，过去年年不能完成粮食生产计划。自从县委认清自然特点，抓住自然规律，发动群众在农业生产上进行许多改革之后，面貌大大改观。今年平均亩产四百四十八斤，一跃成为吉林省目前单产最高的县份。西部草原地区各县，今年的粮食亩产也有著显增加。
    吉林省的农业生产，自去秋以来，经过农村整风，广大农民的政治觉悟和生产热情空前提高。在兴修水利，增施粪肥，适时早种，抗旱保墒，以及加强田间管理等方面，都大大的前进了一步。但是同全国先进的省份比较，仍远远落在后面。粮食生产还没有过关。因此，争取明年粮食生产更大的跃进，是吉林省人民一项重大的政治任务。目前，全省广大群众正在今年丰收的鼓舞下积极展开以秋收、深耕和大搞钢铁生产为中心的生产高潮。
