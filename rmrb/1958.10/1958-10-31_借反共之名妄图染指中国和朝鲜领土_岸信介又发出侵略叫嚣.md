Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 30th: Socialist Party members of the Diet, Tanako Orinosuke and Kono Jotaro, extensively questioned Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives on the 29th. In his answers, Kishi further exposed his hideous features of hostility towards China and other socialist countries, and his sinister plot to revive Japanese militarism in the name of anti-communism.

    Tanaka first rebuked Kishi's aggressive remarks to American reporter Brown that Japan should rise up and assume responsibility for "preventing communism" in Asia. Tanaka pointed out that this is an attempt to revive Japanese militarism under the guise of anti-communism.

    In his reply, Kishi once again made unfounded slanders and malicious attacks against China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries, as well as the Japanese Communist Party. He openly clamored for "struggle against communism" and "defense."

    Kishi also repeated what he had said to Brown. He said: "In order to prevent Japan from becoming communist, I hope that Korea and Taiwan will not become communist." This once again exposed his deliberate attempt to follow the United States in creating "two Chinas," opposing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and opposing the Korean people's peaceful reunification of their motherland. At the same time, it also exposed the aggressive ambitions of this Japanese militarist to once again seize Korean and Chinese territory.

    Tanaka also pointed out in his questioning that the ongoing negotiations in Tokyo to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" aim to include Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands in the Japan-U.S. "joint defense area," and attempt to link the Japan-U.S. treaty with the U.S.-South Korea and U.S.-Chiang "treaties" to form a "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" in fact. Tanaka demanded that the Kishi government take back these islands from the United States before revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." But Kishi immediately rejected Tanaka's request. He said: "The U.S. side's opinion is not yet consistent with Japan's wishes."

    In his reply, Kishi quibbled that he had slandered China as an "aggressor" when he gave an interview to American reporter Brown, but he dared not confront Brown in the Japanese Diet.

    Kono exposed the deceptive tactics Kishi had adopted towards the Diet regarding his aggressive remarks to Brown. Kono pointed out that Kishi's talk about deleting the clause on renouncing war from the Japanese Constitution has aroused the concerns of the Japanese people, so the most appropriate way to deal with this is for the Kishi cabinet to announce the withdrawal of these remarks.

    Kono pointed out that Kishi once said that he would retrieve the full text of the broadcast from the United States and make appropriate arrangements after conducting thorough research, but two weeks have passed and it is still nowhere to be found. Kono criticized Kishi's irresponsible attitude. Kishi also attempted to argue back, but was booed back by members of the Socialist Party.

    Kono also questioned the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law Amendment" submitted by the Kishi government to the Diet.

    借反共之名妄图染指中国和朝鲜领土
    岸信介又发出侵略叫嚣
    新华社30日讯　东京消息：日本社会党议员田中织之进和河上丈太郎29日在众议院预算委员会会议上对日本首相岸信介进行了广泛的质询，岸信介在答辩中进一步暴露了他敌视中国和其它社会主义国家的狰狞面目和以反共为名复活日本军国主义的罪恶阴谋。
    田中在质询中首先斥责岸信介向美国记者布朗说的日本要起来承担在亚洲“防共”的责任的侵略性言论。田中指出，这就是企图借反共为名义来复活日本军国主义。
    岸信介在答辩时再次对中国和苏联等社会主义国家和日本共产党进行了毫无根据的诬蔑和恶毒的攻击，他公然叫嚣“必须对共产主义进行斗争”和“防御”。
    岸信介还再次重复了他对布朗说过的话。他说：“为了使日本不致于变成共产主义（国家），我希望朝鲜、台湾不变成共产主义。”这就再一次暴露出他蓄意追随美国制造“两个中国”、反对中国人民解放台湾、反对朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的面目；同时，也暴露出这个日本军国主义者妄图再次染指朝鲜领土和中国领土的侵略野心。
    田中还在质询中指出，目前正在东京进行的修改日美“安全条约”的谈判要把冲绳和小笠原群岛划进日美“共同防御的地区”，是企图把日美条约同美李、美蒋“条约”联在一起，在事实上组成“东北亚条约组织”。田中要求岸信介政府在修改日美“安全条约”以前从美国手里收回这些岛屿。但是岸信介立即拒绝了田中的要求。他说：“美国方面的意见同日本的愿望还不一致。”
    岸信介在答辩中狡赖他在向美国记者布朗发表谈话时曾经诬蔑中国为“侵略者”，但是，他却不敢和布朗在日本国会对质。
    河上揭露了岸信介在他向布朗发表的侵略性谈话的问题上对国会所采取的欺骗手段。河上指出，岸信介说要删去日本宪法中关于放弃战争的条款的谈话，已经引起了日本人民的疑虑，因此应该由岸信介内阁宣布撤销这番谈话，才是最妥善的处理办法。
    河上指出，岸信介曾经说过要从美国取回广播的全文，在进行充分研究以后再作妥善的处理，可是现在已经过了两个星期，仍然没有下落。河上斥责了岸信介这种不负责任的态度。岸信介还企图回嘴狡辩，但被社会党的议员们哄回去了。
    河上还就岸信介政府向国会提出的“警察官职务执行法修正案”进行了质询。
