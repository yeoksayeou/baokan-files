Based on Reality, Bold Imagination
--Discussing the Relationship between Objective Possibility and Subjective Initiative
Shuguang

Is the saying "How daring people are, how productive the land is" subjectivism? We oppose "conditionalism," so do conditions exist or not? How should we understand the principle of "everything changes with time, place, and conditions"? Why is the yield in high-altitude cold regions inevitably lower?

Recently, these questions have been swirling in my mind. I've summarized them into one question: "Is the potential of production and human subjective initiative limited or unlimited?" I'm searching for scientific basis, philosophical basis, and discussing it with theory instructors everywhere.

Chairman Mao told us: "The movement of change in the objective real world is never-ending, and people's understanding of truth in practice is also never-ending." ("On Practice") Based on this principle, I thought: as people's understanding of the growth patterns of crops constantly improves in production practice, and as people's ability to transform nature constantly strengthens, the potential for agricultural yield increases will be continuously tapped. Various conditions are constantly changing, without end, and the potential for agricultural yield increases will also be endless, while human initiative is the key to unlocking this potential. After we learned that rice yields per mu broke the 10,000-jin mark, we then had 30,000 jin, 50,000 jin, 60,000 jin, and now some people are experimenting with 100,000 jin. Our county also has many miracles. This year, "there are many miracles in the Great Leap Forward, our county discovered 600 good seeds (600 grains per ear of rice), cotton formed over 400 bolls, and corn grew 18 of them." These vivid miracles bring people a romantic power of imagination. Who can say that "ears of rice with thousands of grains, each grain like a soybean" is impossible? Who can say that grain yield increases are limited?

Human understanding of nature and social life is an endless process of movement from ignorance to knowledge, from knowing little and not deeply to knowing more and more deeply. That is to say, humans have the unlimited possibility of understanding the ever-changing objective world. When people acknowledge that the development of objective things has its own laws, they are not passive in themselves, but are able to actively promote its transformation and development in accordance with the laws of the development of things. As long as they do not violate the laws of the development of objective things, human subjective initiative can play a great role.

"Conditionalists" ignore human subjective initiative. They always say that our place is a high-altitude cold region, and the climate and soil quality are too poor for high yields to appear. But what are the facts? Daguquan Township and Shanghexi Township in our county are large mountainous areas within our mountainous region, but they achieved a high-yield record of over 2,800 jin per mu. The Party Secretary of Daguquan Township, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area where thatch grass grows densely, cut 800 dan of thatch residue per mu to burn the fields, excavated 1,200 dan of "thousand-year soil" from rock caves per mu, added sufficient fertilizer, changed the soil quality, and analyzed the weakness of the low climate, adopting methods of early sowing, moistening seedling fields, and warm-bed seedling cultivation to give the seedlings a sufficient growing period. Through this series of measures, high yields were finally obtained. From this, it can be seen that they not only acknowledged the principle that "everything changes with time, place, and conditions," but also, in the case of relatively poor conditions, were able to give play to subjective initiative, explore positive factors to overcome difficulties, and transform low yields into high yields. This is entirely in line with dialectical materialism, and completely opposed to the "conditionalists'" thought of regression, which neglects the active role of people and believes that people are powerless to develop objective things.

Practice is the basis of all knowledge. Knowledge depends on practice and guides practice. In practice, people have the ability to continuously and comprehensively reveal the essence and laws of the objective world. As long as we are based on reality, we can completely imagine boldly and romantically. On the other hand, we must also face up to the limitations of the historical conditions of our knowledge of truth in practice, and we cannot expect to exhaust the essence and laws of the objective world in one go. Therefore, we should give full play to human subjective initiative, break through all difficulties and obstacles, and declare war on nature with full enthusiasm, demanding resources and wealth.

In social struggles, there are two kinds of thinking in people: being content with the status quo and transforming the status quo. Similarly, in the struggle against nature, there are also two kinds of thinking: yielding to nature and transforming nature. Nature is especially against cowards and lazy people. The more you fear it, the more stingy it is to you; the more you dare to oppress it, the more it will serve you. Those "conditionalists" and "skeptics" are essentially cowards and lazy people who are content with the status quo and yield to nature. As a revolutionary, one should aspire to be the ruler of nature.

Precisely because things are developing forward without end, and the potential for agricultural yield increases is endless, then, under this premise, proposing the saying "How daring people are, how productive the land is" is not subjective idealism, but entirely in line with dialectical materialism. It is a slogan with full revolutionary spirit.

    立足现实　大胆想像
    ——谈谈客观可能性与主观能动性的关系
    曙光
    “人有多大胆，地有多大产”，这句话是不是主观主义？我们反对“条件论”，那么，条件到底存在不存在？“一切以时间、地点、条件为转移”的道理如何理解？高寒山区为什么产量硬是低些？
    最近，这几个问题老是在我的头脑中盘旋。我把这些归纳为一个问题，叫做“生产的潜力和人的主观能动性是有限的还是无限的？”我到处找科学根据，找哲学根据，找理论教员探讨。
    毛主席告诉我们：“客观现实世界的变化运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。”（“实践论”）根据这个道理，我就想到：随着人们在生产实践中对农作物生长规律的认识的不断提高，随着人们改造自然的能力的不断加强，农业增产的潜力将不断地挖掘出来。各种条件在不断变化，永无休止，农业增产潜力也将无穷无尽，而人的能动性则是打开增产潜力的钥匙。当我们知道了水稻亩产破万关之后，接着又来了个三万斤、五万斤、六万斤，现在还有人在试验十万斤。我们县里的奇迹也不少，今年“大跃进中奇迹多，我县发现良种六百颗（每穗谷六百粒），棉花结桃四百多，苞谷长了十八个它”。这些活生生的奇迹给人们带来了一股浪漫主义的想像力量。谁能说“谷穗千万颗，颗颗像黄豆”是不可能的呢？谁能说粮食增产是有限的呢？
    人对自然界和社会生活的认识，是由不知到知，由知之不多、不深刻，到知之更多、更深刻的无止境的运动过程。也就是说，人有认识变化无穷的客观世界的无限可能性。人在承认客观事物发展中有其自己的规律时，本身并不是消极的，而是能够按照事物的发展规律积极推动它的变革和发展的。只要不违背客观事物的发展规律，人的主观能动性就能发生极大的作用。
    “唯条件论”者就是忽视了人的主观能动性。他们老是说我们这里是个高寒山区，气候、土质太差了，不可能出现高产。但是事实怎样呢？我县打古泉乡与上河溪乡是我们山区中的大山区，却取得了亩产二千八百多斤的高产纪录。打古泉乡党委书记，他们根据大山区中茅草丛生的特点，每亩割了茅草楂八百担铺楂烧田，每亩掘了一千二百担岩穴“千年土”，加足了肥料，改变了土质，又分析了气候较低的弱点，采取提早播种、湿润秧田、温床育苗的办法，使禾苗有充分的生长期。通过这一系列的措施，终于获得了高产。从这里可以看出，他们既承认了“一切以时间、地点、条件为转移”这条原则，又能在条件比较差的情况下发挥主观能动性，发掘克服困难的积极因素，变低产为高产。这是完全符合唯物辩证法的，而和“唯条件论”者的忽视人的能动作用、认为人对客观事物的发展无能为力的促退思想完全相反。
    实践是一切认识的基础。认识依赖于实践而又指导实践。在实践中人们有能力不断地全面地揭露客观世界的本质和规律。只要我们立足于现实，我们就完全可以大胆地富于浪漫主义地想像。另一方面，我们也要正视我们在实践中认识真理的历史条件的限制，我们不能妄想一次就穷尽客观世界的本质和规律。因此，我们就应该充分发挥人的主观能动性，冲破一切困难和阻碍，干劲冲天地向自然宣战，索取资源和财富。
    在社会斗争中，人有安于现状和改造现状的两种思想。同样，在向自然界作斗争中，也存在着屈服于自然和改造自然的两种思想。大自然是专门和懦夫懒汉作对的，你越怕它，它对你越吝啬；你敢于压迫它，它就加倍地为你效劳。那些“唯条件论”者和“怀疑论”者，实质上就是安于现状、屈服于自然的懦夫懒汉。作为一个革命者，要立志做大自然的统治者。
    正因为事物是永无休止地向前发展的，农业增产的潜力是无穷的，那么，我们在这个前提下提出“人有多大胆，地有多大产”这句话，不是主观唯心论，而是完全符合辩证唯物论的。它是一个具有充分革命精神的口号。
