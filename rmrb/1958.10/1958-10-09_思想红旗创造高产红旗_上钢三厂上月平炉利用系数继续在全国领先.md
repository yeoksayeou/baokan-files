Ideological Red Flag Creates High-Yield Red Flag
Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant's Open Hearth Utilization Rate Continues to Lead the Nation Last Month

Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 8th – Reporter He Changhua and Zhou Yongkang report: Why has the open hearth workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant been able to maintain the nation's highest record for open hearth utilization rate for the past two years? The Party Branch Secretary of this workshop revealed the "secret" to reporters in one sentence. He said, "If we plant the red flag of Marxism-Leninism on the steelmaking furnace, people's subjective initiative can be greatly brought into play. Some people say that politics cannot make steel, but we rely on putting politics in command to constantly create miracles."

In terms of equipment conditions, the open hearth workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant is much worse than other plants. The two furnaces have been in use for more than thirty years, and the furnace output was originally only ten tons. Paving the furnace and selecting materials were all done manually. However, in the past two years, their utilization rate has been leading the country. In August, it reached 14.225; on September 18th, it reached 21.2; and on September 30th, it further climbed to a higher peak of 22.228, creating a rare high record in the world.

The most fundamental reason for their creation of miracles is that political work is done very well. Under the constant education of the Party organization, every worker understands the meaning of their labor, and improving production has become the workers' conscious action. A new relationship of unity and mutual assistance, of "I am for everyone," has formed between people. The entire workshop, with more than 500 people, has become a unified fighting whole with one thought and one action.

"How daring people are, how much the furnace can produce." The workers in the open hearth workshop deeply understand this point. The furnace output of these two open hearths has gradually increased from ten tons to more than thirty tons in the past two years. However, almost every time there is an increase, there is a debate between advanced and conservative ideas in the workshop. At the end of last year, when the workshop was formulating this year's furnace output target, some people suggested that it should only be set at eighteen tons, and some suggested that it should be set at nineteen tons, which caused a big debate. Some cadres believed that increasing the furnace output would lengthen the smelting time, and the furnace would be easily damaged. It would be more cost-effective to set it at eighteen tons. The Party Branch consulted with veteran steelworkers and cadres from worker backgrounds. The veteran workers agreed to increase it to nineteen tons. They also said that we should look forward, not backward. As a result, not only did they reach nineteen tons early on, but in the first half of this year, they also increased it to more than twenty tons, and the smelting time was shorter than in the past. Under the careful maintenance of the workers, the furnace also created a new record of a furnace life of up to seven hundred and thirty-seven heats. Recently, the furnace output has broken through the 30-ton mark, reaching 34 tons, and production is still very normal.

The spirit of the workers in the open hearth workshop, who are not afraid of difficulties and forge ahead bravely, is inseparable from the education on the domestic and international political situation that is often carried out in the workshop. Before repairing the furnace in the first half of September, the workshop Party organization, based on the Party Central Committee's call to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year and Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, repeatedly explained that repairing the furnace an hour earlier and making steel earlier would strengthen the country's power faster. Therefore, the workers regarded repairing the furnace as a glorious political task. On the day of the furnace repair, before dawn, workers from various shifts rushed to the furnace. As soon as the furnace was shut down, the workers dismantled the furnace in high heat. As a result, the two open hearths were repaired in forty-one hours and fifty-three minutes and forty-one hours and thirty-four minutes, setting two new national records for rapid furnace repair.

It is precisely because the workers understand the economic and political significance of steelmaking that the collectivist and communist ideas of the entire workshop have been greatly developed. Between shifts, between furnaces, and between cadres and the masses, no one wants to affect the overall situation due to the disconnection of their link. People can often see: workers from this shift stay behind after work to help workers from the next shift charge materials; workers from the next shift arrive early before their shift starts to help the previous shift operate. The workers from the two furnaces are clearly competing rivals for the red flag, but if either side has rapid steelmaking experience, they tell the other side without reservation. Workers in all links, such as the gas furnace and the steel pouring yard, also often take the initiative to contact the open hearth to ensure that steelworkers create new records. Cadres and workers are closely integrated and work together. In the most tense moments of production, cadres also take the lead in charging forward. This ensures that the workshop's production continues to move forward by leaps and bounds.

Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 8th – The open hearth workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which holds the national high-yield red flag for open hearths, overfulfilled the state plan by 250 tons of steel in September. The average utilization rate of the open hearth in this workshop in September was 14, continuing to lead the country. By the end of September, more than 72% of the workshop's annual plan had been completed.

In September, the pig iron used for steelmaking in the open hearth workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant sometimes had a sulfur content about twice as high as in the past. In the second half of the month, it was also repeatedly hit by high tides, which greatly affected the smelting time. However, the workers were encouraged by the Party Central Committee's call to ensure that steel production doubled, and they saw that the People's Daily repeatedly reported their production achievements and heard that open hearth workers in Anshan, Chongqing, and other places were catching up and competing for the high-yield red flag for open hearths. They were determined to step up production and plant the red flag on a higher peak. Through joint efforts, the furnace output of this workshop became higher and higher. On September 30th, in twenty-three hours and fifty-three minutes, they produced thirteen heats of high-quality steel with 50% scrap steel, creating the highest record of daily output of 444.569 tons of steel, and the open hearth utilization rate reached 22.228.

    思想红旗创造高产红旗
    上钢三厂上月平炉利用系数继续在全国领先
    本报上海8日电　记者贺昌华、周永康报道：上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间为什么两年来一直能够保持平炉利用系数的全国最高纪录？这个车间的党总支书记对记者一语道破了其中的“奥秘”。他说，把马克思列宁主义的红旗插上炼钢炉，人的主观能动性就能大大发挥，有人说政治炼不出钢，我们就是靠政治挂帅，才不断创造奇迹的。
    论设备条件，上钢三厂的平炉车间比别的厂差得多。两座炉子已用了三十多年，炉产量原来只有十吨，铺炉、选料等都是手工操作，但在最近两年来，它们的利用系数一直在全国领先，8月份达到了十四点二二五，9月18日又达到二十一点二，9月30日进一步登上了二十二点二二八的更高峰，创造了世界上罕见的高纪录。
    他们创造奇迹的最根本的原因，是政治工作做得非常出色。在党组织的不断教育下，每一个工人都懂得自己劳动的意义，提高生产变成工人们自觉的行动，人与人之间形成了一种团结互助，我为人人的新关系。整个车间五百多人，一个思想，一个行动，结成为一个统一的战斗整体。
    “人有多大胆，炉有多大产”，平炉车间的职工对这一点体会得非常深切。这两座平炉的炉产量，两年来从十吨逐步提高到三十多吨。但是，几乎每一次的提高，车间里都有一番先进与保守的思想争执。去年年底，车间里制订今年的炉产量指标时，有人提出只能订到十八吨，有人提出应该订到十九吨，引起了一场大争论。有些干部认为：提高炉产量，冶炼时间会拖长，炉子也容易烧坏，反而不如订十八吨合算。党总支找老炼钢工人和老工人出身的干部商量，老工人们赞成提高到十九吨，他们还说，眼睛要向前看，不要向后看。结果，不但早就炼到十九吨，今年上半年，还提高到二十吨以上，冶炼时间反比过去缩短。炉子在工人们精心维护之下，还创造了炉龄长达七百三十七炉的新纪录。最近，炉产量又冲出了三十吨的大关，达到三十四吨，生产也照样很正常。
    平炉车间工人的不畏艰难、勇往直前的精神，是和车间里经常进行的国内外政治形势的教育分不开的。9月上半月修炉子以前，车间党组织根据党中央关于今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的号召和周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，反复说明早一个钟头修好炉子早炼钢，就可以更快地增强国家的力量。工人们因此都把抢修炉子看成一项光荣的政治任务。修炉那天，天还没亮，各班工人纷纷赶到了炉前。炉子一熄火，工人们就冒着高热拆炉。结果以四十一小时五十三分和四十一小时三十四分的时间修完了两座平炉，连创两次全国快速修炉的新纪录。
    正是由于工人们懂得了炼钢工作的经济意义和政治意义，整个车间的集体主义和共产主义思想大大发扬。班与班、炉与炉、干部和群众，谁都不愿意由于自己这一环节的脱节而影响大局。人们时时可以看到：这一班工人下班后留下不走，帮下一班工人进料；下一班工人还没有到上班时间，就提前上班，帮上一班操作。两个炉子的工人明明是抢红旗的竞赛对手，但是双方一有快速炼钢的经验，都毫无保留地告诉对方。煤气炉、浇钢场等各个环节上的工人，也经常主动到平炉前来联系，保证炼钢工人创造新纪录。干部和工人紧密地打成一片，一起劳动。在生产最紧张的时候，干部还带头冲锋。这就保证了车间的生产不断地大踏步向前发展。
    本报上海8日电　高举全国平炉高产红旗的上海第三钢铁厂平炉车间，9月份超额二百五十吨钢完成了国家计划。这个车间9月份的平炉平均利用系数为十四，继续在全国领先。到9月底，这个车间全年计划已经完成72％以上。
    9月份，上钢三厂平炉车间炼钢用的生铁，含硫量有时比过去高出一倍左右；下半月还接连受到大潮汛的侵袭，大大影响了冶炼时间。但是，工人们受到党中央关于保证钢产量翻一番的号召的鼓舞，并且看到人民日报上一再报道他们的生产成绩，听到鞍山、重庆等地的平炉工人正在急起直追，争夺平炉高产红旗，他们决心加紧生产，把红旗插上更高峰。经过共同努力，这个车间的炉产量越来越高。9月30日，在二十三小时五十三分钟内，他们在掺用了50％废铁的情况下炼出了十三炉优质钢，创造了日产四百四十四点五六九吨钢的最高纪录，平炉利用系数达到二十二点二二八。
