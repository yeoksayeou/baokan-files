    Azaleas in the Twelfth Lunar Month

    After dinner, the snowflakes continued to fall. We finished applying our makeup, started beating the gongs and drums, and welcomed the Korean People's Army troops who came to attend the evening party at the entrance of the club. The enthusiastic sounds of gongs and drums and laughter echoed in the valley, breaking the silence around and dispelling the severe cold.
    Before long, we suddenly saw what looked like a red fire dragon on the opposite mountain peak, constantly moving in the wind and snow. It also looked like a beautiful rainbow, coming from the vast sky, slowly, slowly rolling into the boundless snow sea. In an instant, the cheering crowd immediately became silent. The singing, laughter, and the sound of gongs and drums suddenly disappeared. People seemed to be completely fascinated by this strange illusion, not knowing whether it was reality or a dream, nor whether it was the human world or a fairyland. Everyone stared intently at this magical scene.
    After watching for a long time, people finally understood completely that this was not a fire dragon, nor a rainbow, but a team of soldiers holding flowers, the People's Army heroes guarding Mount Kumgang. In order to express their gratitude and welcome to their close comrades-in-arms, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and to celebrate the victorious reunion of these two heroic armies on the front lines, they brought the most precious gifts to participate in this grand evening party.
    When they were about to approach us, everyone couldn't help but swarm up like a swarm of bees, embracing tightly in the knee-deep snow in a frenzy of cheers. Who could believe that in this deep mountain and wild forest besieged by storms, on this once desolate battlefield, on this forward position still harboring jackals on the opposite side, such beautiful bouquets of flowers would appear? Who could believe that in this freezing cold of the ninth day of the winter month, at forty degrees below zero, these red flowers would bloom?
    But this was indeed true. A People's Army regimental commander comrade, who had once fought as a guerrilla in our Changbai Mountains, seemed to know our feelings. He used his not-so-fluent Northeastern dialect to solve the mystery for us. This unforgettable story still deeply excites my heart to this day.
    It was two months ago when the People's Army troops heard the news that the Volunteer Army delegation was coming. A spring breeze seemed to blow across the position, and the entire regiment was immediately stirred up. In order to express their welcome to the Volunteer Army delegation, the soldiers used every spare moment to set up decorated arches, write slogans, tidy up the rooms, clear the roads… But they always felt that all this could not express their feelings. Therefore, some soldiers quietly ran to the islands to cut down a large number of winter bamboos, weave exquisite flower pots, and then ran to the ice layer of the east coast to find colorful shells and inlaid them on the flower pots. They said, "Give it to the Volunteer Army and plant evergreen trees!" Some soldiers also found thick vines from Mount Kumgang and made them into crutches, on which they engraved the words "Long Live Sino-Korean Friendship". Many soldiers also made various kinds of paper flowers with colored paper, but they felt that how could paper flowers express their feelings? One soldier said, "If it were the season of blooming flowers in spring, with azaleas blooming everywhere, that would be great! I will definitely choose a bouquet of the freshest and reddest flowers to dedicate to our comrades-in-arms…" His words suddenly opened up people's minds and stimulated the enthusiasm hidden deep in the soldiers' hearts. Therefore, they were determined to cultivate red flowers in the cold winter of the twelfth lunar month. They wanted to create a miracle in this unlikely situation with their will, enthusiasm, and determination.
    That very night, the heroes braved the piercing cold wind and climbed the snow-covered peaks of Mount Kumgang, digging out hibernating flower seeds from the frozen, steel-like ground, and quietly transplanted them into the room. The soldiers kept the heated kang burning day and night, as if they were on duty, to maintain a certain temperature in the room, and constantly irrigated them with warm water. These countless young lives, as if nurtured in the arms of a loving mother, absorbed the mother's nourishment. And these soldiers, like countless most kind mothers, nurtured them day and night, even without a moment's rest.
    I don't know how many days and nights passed, this motherly warmth finally awakened the sleeping flower seeds. They sprouted and grew vigorously, as if covering the ground with a green velvet.
    I don't know how much labor was put in, these bright flowers finally revealed a sweet smile. This smile seemed to bring the breath of spring to people, and this smile made the heroes' faces blush. When the soldiers saw these flowers cultivated by their own labor and effort, how could they not feel ecstatic? Today happened to be the time when the flowers were blooming most brightly, so the soldiers picked these red flowers and dedicated them to the Volunteer Army.
    When we received these flowers of friendship and heard this true story, we only felt our hearts beating violently. What gift in the world is more precious than these flowers? What deep affection in the world is thicker than this friendship? These red azaleas are flowers that will never wither. They will always bloom among the flowers, just like the evergreen ancient pine, forever planted in the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people.

    腊月的金达莱
    邬戈
    晚饭后，雪花还在不停地飘落，我们化完了妆，敲打起锣鼓，在俱乐部门口欢迎前来参加晚会的朝鲜人民军部队。热情的锣鼓声和欢笑声在山谷中回响着，划破了四周的宁静，也驱散了严寒。
    过了不久，我们突然看到对面山顶上好像有一条红色的火龙，在风雪中不停地游动着，又好像是一条美丽的长虹，来自茫茫的天空，它慢慢地，慢慢地，滚卷在无边无际的雪海之中。霎时间，正在欢腾着的人群立刻就变得鸦雀无声，歌声笑声和锣鼓声也突然消失了，人们仿佛全被这奇异的幻境迷住，不知道这是现实还是幻梦，也不知道这是人间还是仙境，一个个都目不转睛地注视着这奇幻的情景。
    注视了很久，人们终于完全明白了，这不是火龙，也不是长虹，而是一队捧着鲜花的战士，是守卫在金刚山上的人民军英雄。他们为了表示对亲密的战友——中国人民志愿军的答谢和欢迎，为了庆贺这两支英雄的军队在前线胜利重逢，因此，带着最珍贵的礼物前来参加这个隆重的晚会。
    当他们快要走近我们的时候，大伙儿情不自禁地、一窝蜂似地涌了上去，在狂热的欢呼声中紧紧地拥抱在半人多深的雪地里。谁能相信在这被风暴围困的深山野林里，在这曾经是一片荒凉的战场上，在这对面还窝藏着豺狼的前沿阵地上，会出现这样一束束美丽的鲜花呢？谁又能相信在这数九隆冬、零下四十多度的严寒里，会盛开这红色的花朵呢？
    可是，这的确是真的。一位曾经在我们长白山上打过游击的人民军联队长同志好像知道了我们的心情似的，用一口不太流利的东北话，替我们解开了这个谜。而这个使人难忘的故事，直到今天，还深深地激动着我的心。
    那是在两个月以前，人民军部队听到了志愿军代表团将要到来的消息以后，阵地上好像刮来了一阵春风，顿时间轰动了整个联队。为了表示对志愿军代表团的欢迎，战士们利用了一切空隙时间，扎上了彩门，写好了标语，整理了房间，扫清了道路……但是总觉得这一切还无法表达出自己的心情，于是，有的战士悄悄地跑到海岛上砍来了大批冬竹，编织了精致的花盆，又跑到东海岸的冰层里，找来了彩色的贝壳，镶在花盆上，他们说：“送给志愿军，栽上万年青！”有的战士又从金刚山上找来了一条条粗藤，制成了拐杖，上面又刻上了“中朝友谊万岁”的字样。还有很多战士用彩纸扎起了各式各样的纸花，可是他们又觉得纸花怎么能表达出心意呢？有一位战士说“假如现在是春暖花开的时节，遍地盛开着金达莱花，那该多好啊！我一定选一束最鲜最红的花献给我们的战友……”他的话突然打开了人们的思路，也激发了战士们蕴藏在内心深处的热情。于是，他们坚决要在数九隆冬、十冬腊月的季节里栽培出红色的鲜花来，他们要在这很少有可能的情况下用意志、热情和决心去创造出奇迹来。
    就在当天深夜，英雄们冒着穿心刺骨的寒风，攀上了白雪皑皑的金刚山峰，从冰冻三尺、坚如钢板似的地里，挖出了冬眠的花种，悄悄地把它们移植在房里。战士们昼夜不停地，像值班站哨似地烧着热炕，使房间保持了一定的温度，还不时地用温水灌溉着它们。这些无数个幼小的生命，好像孕育在慈母的怀中一样，吸收着母亲的养分，而这些战士们又像无数个最善良的母亲一样，夜以继日地，甚至于一刻不停地在抚育着它们。
    不知道经过了多少个昼夜，这种慈母般的温暖，终于唤醒了沉睡着的花种。它们尽情地发芽、茁长，好像给地面铺上一幅绿色的丝绒。
    也不知道付出了多少劳动，这鲜艳的花朵终于露出了甜蜜的笑容，这笑容仿佛给人们带来了春天的气息，这笑容又把英雄们的脸庞映得通红。当战士们看到了这些用自己的劳动和心血栽培起来的花朵的时候，怎么会不感到欣喜若狂呢？而今天刚好是花朵开得最鲜艳的时候，于是，战士们就把这红色的鲜花摘下来，献给了志愿军。
    当我们接到这友谊的花朵，听完了这段真实的故事，只觉得心脏在剧烈地跳动。世上还有什么礼物，比这鲜花更贵重？世上还有什么挚情，比这友谊更深厚呢？这红色的金达莱是永不雕谢的花朵，它将永远盛开在百花丛中，如同万年长青的古松一样，永生永世地栽扎在中朝人民的心里。
