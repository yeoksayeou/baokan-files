Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, October 13th (Reporter Tian Lianggeng) reports: The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, historically known as a "malaria-infested area," has become a basically malaria-free prefecture and a basically "seven-free" (free of rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, and bedbugs) prefecture.

This autonomous prefecture, located in the subtropical zone, has tens of thousands of acres of forests, wasteland, and swamps, making natural conditions extremely suitable for the breeding of mosquitoes and flies. In the past, ethnic minorities lacked the ability to defend against diseases, and malignant malaria was extremely rampant here, becoming a well-known "ultra-high malaria epidemic area" both domestically and abroad. According to a 1950 survey, the highest malaria incidence rate was 71%, and the lowest was 17%. The prefecture had approximately more than 500,000 malaria patients, with a very high mortality rate. Outsiders did not dare to rest in the plains when they came here, but had to go up the mountains in the dark to stay overnight, fearing "miasma." Four years ago, when the reporter first came here, the mosquitoes were still dense at night, invading mosquito nets and making it impossible to sleep.

Recently, the reporter came here again and saw a completely different scene. Everything is clean everywhere, and you can sleep without mosquito nets at night. In Mangshi Town, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, four middle-aged women who had suffered from malaria for seven to thirteen years without conceiving have successively given birth to their first child. The phenomenon of "only seeing mothers pregnant, but not seeing children walking the streets" has become a thing of the past. According to surveys, the net population growth rate in the border counties in the past three years has been between 3% and 7%. The Dai village of Fapa Township, surrounded by dragon bamboo and banana groves, is no longer a place of "looking at green hills and clear waters from a distance, but seeing piles of cow dung up close." People have built pigsties and toilets for the first time, and if there is occasional cow dung on the road, it is quickly picked up by people collecting fertilizer. There is a private hospital here, but very few people come to seek medical treatment. Malaria has basically disappeared in Jingpo villages, which were once on the verge of extinction due to ethnic oppression and malaria. The malaria incidence rate in the prefecture from January to August this year was 0.25%, a decrease of 91.5% compared to the same period last year. Longchuan County, one of the "ultra-high malaria areas," still had more than 3,000 malaria patients last year, but has decreased to only 18 people so far this year. Such a huge change can only happen in our country during the Great Leap Forward.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have spent a great deal of effort to eliminate malaria in the border areas. In 1952, the central government and the province successively sent more than 300 medical personnel to go deep into the villages, providing free treatment to the masses while publicizing the Party's ethnic policies, and have achieved great results in recent years. This year, combined with the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the health cadres of the prefecture, with the determination to eliminate malaria in one year, relied on the masses, combined with production, and quickly launched a high tide of malaria eradication. According to statistics from five counties in the border area, more than 75,000 people have completed anti-relapse treatment this year, and 20,000 people have received preventive treatment, and they have already overcome the peak of malaria epidemics that have occurred in April and May in the past. At the same time, the prefecture launched a massive campaign to eliminate the "seven pests" of sparrows, rats, mosquitoes, flies, fleas, lice, and bedbugs. Ethnic minorities consciously changed superstitions and old habits. Dai old ladies who firmly believe in Buddhism also took action to catch sparrows. Dai girls who used to pinch their noses when they saw manure are now happily carrying manure. Jingpo shamans took the lead in cleaning the "ghost temples" that were never allowed to be cleaned. Under this momentum of changing customs, after nine months of general mobilization, nearly 10 million sparrows and rats were eliminated, countless malaria mosquitoes and flies were eliminated, and the length of the ditches cleared was longer than from Mangshi to Guiyang.

    过去瘴疠区  今日“七无”州
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州完全改观
    新华社昆明13日电　记者田良耕报道：历来被称为“瘴疠之区”的云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州，已经成为基本无疟州和基本“七无”（无鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、跳蚤、虱子、臭虫）州。
    这个处在亚热带的自治州，有数万亩森林、荒地和沼地，自然条件极适合蚊蝇的孳生。过去，少数民族人民缺乏防御疾病的能力，恶性疟疾在这里极为猖獗，成为中外著名的“超高度疟疾流行区”。据1950年调查，疟疾发病率最高达71％，最低也有17％。全州约有五十多万疟疾患者，死亡率很高。外地人到这里都不敢在平坝歇脚，摸黑也要上山住宿，怕中“瘴毒”。四年前记者第一次来到这里时，夜晚还是蚊子密集，侵袭蚊帐，令人不能入眠。
    最近，记者再次来到这里，看到的却完全是另一番景象。到处干干净净，晚上睡觉也可以不挂蚊帐了。在自治州首府芒市镇，有四个曾因疟疾缠身七年到十三年不怀孕的中年妇女，都已陆续生了头胎娃娃。“只见娘怀胎，不见儿赶街”的现象，已成为历史的陈迹了。据调查：近三年来边疆各县人口净增率在3％到7％。在龙竹和芭蕉丛林环抱的傣族法帕乡，不再是“远看青山绿水，近看牛屎成堆”的地方，人们第一次修筑起猪厩和厕所，路上偶尔有牛粪，也很快被积肥的人拾走。这里有民办医院，但登门求医的很少。曾被民族压迫和疟疾等折磨得濒于灭亡的景颇族村寨，疟疾已基本绝迹。全州今年1月到8月的疟疾发病率是0.25％，比去年同期下降91.5％。“超高疟区”之一的陇川县，去年还有三千多疟疾病人，而今年至今已减少到只有十八人了。这种巨大的变化，只有在大跃进中的我国才有。
    解放以来，党和政府对消灭边疆疟疾曾花了很大精力。1952年，中央和省里曾先后派了三百多名医务人员，深入村寨，一面免费给群众治疗，一面宣传党的民族政策，几年来已获得很大成绩。今年，结合农业生产大跃进，全州卫生干部以一年消灭疟疾的决心，依靠群众，结合生产，迅速掀起了灭疟的高潮。据边沿区五个县统计，今年完成抗复发治疗七万五千多人，预防二万人，已经攻垮了历来4、5月间出现的疟疾流行的高峰。与此同时，全州展开了声势浩大的除麻雀、老鼠、蚊、蝇、跳蚤、虱子、臭虫等七害的运动。少数民族人民自觉地改变迷信和旧习。笃信佛教的傣族老大妈也动手捕雀。以往见到大粪就掐鼻子的傣族姑娘现在都高高兴兴地挑大粪了。景颇族巫师带头打扫从来不准打扫的“鬼庙”。在这种移风易俗的干劲下，经过九个月的总动员，就消灭近一千万只麻雀和老鼠，消灭了无数的疟蚊和苍蝇，疏通沟渠的长度比从芒市到贵阳还长。
