Editor's Note:

    Prevention is More Important Than Cure
    This year, in the process of strengthening field management, vast areas have adopted the method of field "consultations," upgrading many crops from third-class seedlings to first-class or second-class seedlings. Facts have proven that people have become good doctors for treating third-class seedlings.
    Doctors can treat diseases, and doctors can also prevent diseases. In Henan, various regions are improving the sowing quality of late-season wheat to ensure that wheat seedlings emerge strong, eliminating third-class seedlings before sowing. This presents a new policy for eliminating third-class seedlings—prevention is more important than cure.

    防重于治
    今年广大地区在加强田间管理中，采取了田间“会诊”的办法，把不少作物的三类苗提高为一类苗或二类苗。事实证明：人已成了医治三类苗的好医生了。
    医生会治病，医生也会防病。河南各地提高晚茬麦播种质量，保证小麦幼苗出土即壮，把三类苗消灭在播种以前，正是一种“防患于未然”的措施。这在消灭三类苗上提出了一个新的方针——防重于治。
