Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th - Shandong Province has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, fundamentally solving the grain problem that has historically never been resolved. The total grain output for the province is estimated to reach approximately 80 billion jin, which is 3.2 times the 25.3 billion jin of last year, averaging nearly 1,500 jin per person. The total cotton output is estimated to reach about 12 million dan of ginned cotton, more than double last year's production. The total peanut output is estimated to reach 4.1 billion jin, an increase of 1.5 times over last year. The yields of other crops such as flue-cured tobacco and garlic have also significantly improved this year.

Under the slogan of "Hard Work for Three Years to Change the Face of Shandong," the people of Shandong displayed revolutionary heroism, vigorously engaged in water conservancy, fertilization, and soil improvement, thereby changing production conditions and overcoming severe natural disasters. This led to a new situation on the agricultural front this autumn: both thousands of high-yield "satellites" and large areas of high yields. According to incomplete statistics, the area occupied by high-yield autumn crops yielding over 5,000 jin per mu reached more than 314,000 mu. There emerged two specialized areas with over 1,000 jin of corn and millet—Liaocheng and Heze; two counties with over 5,000 jin of both millet and corn—Shou Zhang and Fan County; and 58 counties and cities with over 1,000 jin of millet, corn, and sorghum.

This year's bumper harvest in Shandong agriculture broke the limitations of various soil types and conditions. High and abundant yields emerged in large areas of saline-alkali and waterlogged areas, as well as in barren mountainous areas. The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Yanbin Township, Junan County, cultivated sorghum on 100 mu of waterlogged land, achieving an average yield of 1,160 jin per mu. Wulian County, where mountainous and hilly areas account for 82.1% of the total cultivated land, jumped from a yield of 190 jin per mu last year to an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu for its 97,000+ mu of sorghum and corn this year.

Currently, the late autumn crops in Shandong have begun to be harvested. Party organizations at all levels are leading the masses in meticulous harvesting to ensure that every grain is collected, while also leading the masses in deep plowing and sowing wheat to strive for a province-wide average wheat yield of 1,000 jin next year.

This newspaper, Yinchuan, 5th - The 5.6 million mu of major autumn crops in the Ningxia area have been successively harvested. According to preliminary statistics, the total output of major autumn crops in the region reached 1.802 billion jin. The average yield per mu reached about 320 jin, an increase of 173.5% compared to last year. This year, the total output of summer and autumn crops in the Ningxia region reached more than 2.7 billion jin, an increase of more than 127% compared to last year. This year, the region averages 1,500 jin of grain per person.

This year, all kinds of major autumn crops in the region have launched high-yield satellites. The 32,000+ mu of rice in Wuzhong City achieved an average yield of 1,030 jin per mu, realizing the "Thousand Jin Rice City." The Xiansheng Commune in Zhongwei set a high-yield record of 6,035 jin of rice per mu. The Hanjiashui Cooperative in Yanchi County, a drought-stricken mountainous area, set a high-yield record of 7,140 jin of millet per mu and more than 4,600 jin of corn per mu.

From sowing to harvest this year, the region concentrated its efforts to strengthen field management of major autumn crops, and through continuous field observation and comparison, the measures for increasing production were implemented deeper into the fields. The counties also criticized the mentality of waiting for a bumper harvest, which further encouraged the enthusiasm of the farmers, resulting in a doubling of the amount of fertilizer applied to autumn fields compared to last year. At the same time, all localities promptly organized the masses to eliminate pests, rice blast, potato late blight, and natural disasters such as hail, ensuring a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year.

    我国第二个人口最多的省由缺粮变为余粮
    山东产粮八百亿斤
    宁夏夏秋作物增产一倍多，每人合粮1500斤
    新华社济南5日电　山东省今年在农业生产上获得了史无前例的大丰收，基本上解决了历史上从未解决的粮食问题。全省粮食总产量预计可达八百亿斤左右，等于去年二百五十三亿斤的三点二倍，平均每人接近一千五百斤；棉花总产量预计可达皮棉一千二百万担左右，比去年增产两倍多；花生总产量可达四十一亿斤，比去年增产一倍半；其他如黄烟、大蒜的产量今年也都获得了显著的提高。
    在“苦干三年，改变山东面貌”的口号下，山东人民发挥了革命英雄主义，大搞水、肥、土，从而改变了生产条件，战胜了严重的自然灾害，使今年秋季农业战线上出现了新的情况：既有成千上万的高产“卫星”，又有大面积的丰产。据不完全的统计，各地放出的高产秋季作物五千斤以上的“卫星”所占的面积达三十一万四千多亩。出现了两个千斤以上的玉米、谷子专区——聊城、菏泽专区，两个谷子、玉米双五千斤以上的县——寿张、范县；五十八个谷子、玉米、高粱千斤以上的县、市。
    今年山东农业大丰收，打破了各种土壤和条件的限制，在盐碱涝洼地带和土地瘠薄的山区，同样出现了大面积的高额丰产。莒南县筵滨乡新华农业社在一百亩涝洼地种的高粱，平均亩产一千一百六十斤。山区丘陵地占总耕地面积82.1％的五莲县，由去年的亩产一百九十斤，一跃而使今年的九万七千多亩高粱、玉米平均亩产千斤以上。
    目前，山东晚秋作物已开始收获。各地党组织正领导群众进行精收细打、颗粒归仓的抢收，同时领导群众进行深翻土地，种好小麦的抢种工作，以力争明年实现小麦千斤省。
    本报银川5日电　宁夏地区五百六十多万亩大秋作物已陆续登场。据初步统计，全区大秋作物总产量达到十八亿零二百万斤。平均亩产量达到三百二十斤左右，比去年增加了173.5％。今年宁夏地区夏秋两季作物的总产量达到二十七亿多斤，比去年增加127％以上。今年全区平均每人有粮食一千五百斤。
    今年全区各种大秋作物都放出了高产卫星。吴忠市的三万二千多亩水稻平均亩产达到一千零三十斤，实现了“千斤水稻市”。中卫先声公社创造了水稻亩产六千零三十五斤的高产纪录。干旱山区的盐池县喊叫水社创造了糜子亩产七千一百四十斤、谷子四千六百多斤的高产纪录。
    今年全区的大秋作物从播种到收获，集中力量加强了田间管理，并通过连续性的田间观摩评比，使增产措施步步深入田间。各县还批判了等待丰收的思想，更加鼓舞了农民群众的干劲，使秋田施肥量比去年增加了一倍。同时各地及时组织群众，消灭了虫害、稻瘟病、洋芋晚疫病和雹灾等自然灾害，保证了今年秋季作物的大丰收。
