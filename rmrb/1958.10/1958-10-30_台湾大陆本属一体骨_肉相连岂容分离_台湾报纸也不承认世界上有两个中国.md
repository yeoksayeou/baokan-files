Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, Taipei dispatch: The United States, after the conclusion of the Dulles-Chiang talks, has been vigorously promoting the conspiracy to create "Two Chinas," which has aroused great vigilance on the Taiwan side. Taking advantage of the "13th Taiwan Retrocession Day" on the 25th, Taiwan newspapers published commentaries and special articles, arguing that Taiwan and the mainland are related by flesh and blood, and have been an inseparable part of China since ancient times.

	The Taiwan Kuomintang's official newspaper, the "Central Daily News," stated in its editorial: "Taiwan has historically belonged to our country's territory. As early as the Sui Dynasty's Daye era in the sixth century, our country was already engaged in the development of Taiwan and Penghu." The editorial said that the vast majority of the ten million compatriots in Taiwan today migrated from Fujian, Guangdong, and other places in past dynasties. The Taiwan compatriots' "national spirit of expelling foreign tribes and returning to the motherland has always been strong and unyielding. Zheng Chenggong's heroic act of expelling the Dutch further inspired the revolutionary movement of Taiwan compatriots who later followed one another in resisting Japanese rule. Mr. Qiu Fengjia praised the revolutionary patriots of Taiwan Province in a poem: 'There have been many righteous people on the island since ancient times.' Because Taiwan compatriots have long suffered from oppression by foreign tribes, their spirit of 'loving the country and protecting the race' is particularly high."

	On the same day, the "Central Daily News" published a large "Special Issue Commemorating the 13th Taiwan Retrocession Day," publishing many articles such as "The Relationship Between Taiwan and the Mainland from the Perspective of Culture and Education," "The Relationship Between Taiwan and the Mainland from the Perspective of Revolution," "The Relationship Between Taiwan and the Mainland from the Perspective of Religious Belief," and "Taiwanese Poets' Remembrance of the Mainland," all arguing that Taiwan has belonged to China since ancient times and is an inseparable part of China's territory.

	The "Central Daily News" also published Chiang Kai-shek's speech commemorating the "13th Taiwan Retrocession Day," in which he said: "It must be known that Taiwan and the mainland are inherently one entity, related by flesh and blood, and sharing weal and woe." Chiang Kai-shek also clamored that "as long as the mainland is not recovered," his "revolutionary responsibility will not be completed for a single day."

	Another Taiwan Kuomintang's official newspaper, the "New Life Daily," said in its editorial on the same day, "Some international figures do often love to draw a line between China and Taiwan, and even in the general books and periodicals of allied countries like the United States, we will find that 'Chinese' and 'Taiwanese' are divided into two nouns, which leads to all kinds of incorrect concepts."

	Taiwan's "United Daily News" said in its editorial, "For a long time, many inexplicable people in the international community have insisted that Taiwan compatriots and mainland compatriots are two different things. Even reporters from the 'New York Times' and 'Newsweek' are distorting the facts." The newspaper said, "Taiwan is, after all, the Taiwan of the Chinese people," and "all recognitions and reports that disregard the facts are meaningless in our view."

	Taiwan's "Public Opinion Daily" said in its editorial, "The mainland is the homeland from which Taiwan compatriots come, where the tombs of everyone's ancestors are located, and the relationship between them is thicker than water."

    台湾大陆本属一体  骨肉相连岂容分离
    台湾报纸也不承认世界上有两个中国
    新华社29日讯　台北消息：美国在杜蒋会谈结束后极力推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，已经在台湾方面引起了很大的戒心。台湾各报在25日趁“台湾省第十三届光复节”的时机纷纷发表评论和专文，论证台湾同大陆骨肉相关，自古以来即是属于中国的不可分割的领土。
    台湾国民党机关报
  “中央日报”的社论说，
  “台湾在历史上夙隶我国版图。远在第六世纪隋代大业年间，我国即已从事台澎的开发。”社论说，今天台湾一千万同胞绝大部分都是历代从福建、广东等地迁徙去的。台湾同胞“排除异族复归祖国的民族精神，始终坚强不屈。郑成功驱逐荷兰人的壮举，更启发了日后台省同胞前仆后继，以反抗日人统治的革命运动。丘逢甲先生赞美台省革命志士有诗云：‘古来义士岛人多’，台省同胞因久受异族欺凌压迫，其‘爱国保种’的精神特别昂扬”。
    同一天，“中央日报”出版了“台湾省第十三届光复节纪念特刊”一大张，登载“从文化教育看台湾与大陆的关系”、“从革命看台湾与大陆的关系”、“从宗教信仰看台湾与大陆的关系”、“台湾诗人对大陆的怀念”等许多文章，纷纷论证台湾自古以来都属于中国，是中国不可分割的一部分领土。
    这一天的“中央日报”还刊登了蒋介石纪念“台湾第十三届光复节”的讲词，其中说：“须知台湾和大陆本属一体，骨肉相关，休戚与共”。蒋介石还叫嚷说，“大陆一日没有光复”，他的“革命责任便一日没有完成”。
    另一家台湾国民党机关报“新生报”在这一天的社论里说，“有一部分国际人士的确常常爱在中国与台湾之间划出一条界线，甚至在盟邦美国的一般书刊之中，我们也会发现把‘中国人’与‘台湾人’分成两个名词，以致引起种种不正确的观念。”
    台湾“联合报”的社论说，“很久以来，国际间许多莫名其妙的人，硬说台湾同胞与大陆同胞是两回事。甚至如‘纽约时报’、‘新闻周刊’的记者，也在吠影吠声地歪曲事实。”这家报纸说，“台湾，毕竟是中国人的台湾”，“一切罔顾事实的认定与报道，在我们看来全都只觉得毫无意义”。
    台湾“公论报”的社论说，“大陆是台湾同胞所自而来的故土，大家祖先庐墓所在，彼此的关系血浓于水”。
