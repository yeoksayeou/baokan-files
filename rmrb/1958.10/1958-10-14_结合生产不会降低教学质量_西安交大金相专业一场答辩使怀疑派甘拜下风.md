Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th -- Reporter Sun Chuanhao reports: Teachers and students of the Metallography program of the Mechanical Metallurgy Department of Xi'an Jiaotong University held a debate to comprehensively examine and assess the knowledge and skills acquired by Chen Jingyan, a third-year student, after participating in four months of production work in a factory.

The debate was prompted by the following situation. After the start of the new academic year, like other departments in the university, a few teachers in the Metallography program continued to use the old yardstick of "all other pursuits are inferior; only theory is supreme" to measure teaching quality. They believed that metallography, being a science within engineering, would inevitably lower teaching quality if combined with productive labor. Some fifth-year students also wrote on big-character posters: engaging in production in the workshop only leads to repetitive, simple labor, and can only cultivate laborers with no knowledge or half-knowledge.

The Party branch of the Metallography program studied this situation and decided to organize a mass public debate, using Chen Jingyan, a third-year student who had been working in the university's heat treatment workshop, as the subject, to let the facts speak for themselves: which view was correct, and whether teaching quality had improved or declined.

After Chen Jingyan briefly reported to the assembly on his gains from four months of factory labor, the debate began. Zhou Huijiu, chairman of the debate committee and head of the department, first asked: "How many methods are there for testing steel?" Chen Jingyan was initially a little nervous, but he calmed down slightly and said: "Steel testing generally includes spark testing, metallographic testing, and chemical analysis."

"What practical operational methods are there for preventing deformation of workpieces during quenching?" "How is heat treatment carried out for various grades of steel?" The members of the debate committee raised questions one after another.

Chen Jingyan answered each question in an orderly manner. When explaining the heat treatment process for various grades of steel, he even cited several places where the textbook did not match reality, based on his own practical experience.

People then asked: "How many components are there in pearlite (a metallographic structure)?" Chen Jingyan replied: "Observation under a microscope proves that pearlite has two components: carbide and ferrite."

The questions became increasingly in-depth, but Chen Jingyan was not stumped by these professional theoretical questions, and he answered them all fluently. Regarding the question about pearlite, it is said that an old professor had mistakenly believed in the past that it only had one component, but Chen Jingyan, this student, answered correctly. This surprised many students present, and some of them did not even understand some of the questions. Chen Jingyan, who had been tempered in labor, withstood the test, and he skillfully and correctly answered more than thirty questions about heat treatment technology raised by teachers and students at the meeting.

After Chen Jingyan's debate ended, Liu Jinghua, the person in charge of the heat treatment workshop and a teacher sent down to labor, spoke. She listed many facts and introduced the changes that Chen Jingyan had undergone in terms of politics, physical health, and professional skills through labor. Liu Jinghua said: "As you all know, Chen Jingyan did not pay much attention to politics in the past and had a relatively extreme view of issues, but now he firmly requests to join the Communist Youth League, does not complain when encountering difficulties in his work, and can actively help other students. His health has also improved. Chen Jingyan's professional knowledge has also improved rapidly. He can not only correctly formulate various heat treatment processes but also independently analyze and handle some complex workpieces. In the past few months, he has also mastered many relatively precise instruments and read books and magazines such as 'Metallographic Heat Treatment,' combining them with problems in production." Liu Jinghua asked: "Judging from these facts, who can say that participating in labor has lowered quality?"

After discussion and comprehensive study of everyone's speeches, the debate committee evaluated Chen Jingyan's gains in labor training as: "In the past few months, Chen Jingyan has developed in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education. Judging from his debate performance, Chen Jingyan's operational skills in heat treatment technology are equivalent to the level of a fourth-grade technician, and he has relatively firmly grasped a certain amount of metallographic professional theory."

The facts of the debate seemed to detonate an atomic bomb in the minds of those who advocated "declining quality" and "saturation curve," shattering their "theories" completely. Yu Degang, director of the teaching and research group, said at the meeting: "This debate has pointed out the correct direction for the heat treatment course." He examined the situation of emphasizing theory and neglecting practice in past teaching and expressed that he would also go to the workshop to work with the students in the future. Liu Longzhang, a fifth-year student who had previously advocated that the school should take education as the key link and believed that combining education with productive labor did not conform to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical, jumped onto the stage and said in his first sentence: "We concede defeat and admit our mistakes." She said: "Although our class is higher than Chen Jingyan's, we can't even light the furnace when we get to the workshop. We have memorized the grades of steel in the textbook thoroughly, but we just stare blankly when we see the real thing. Comrade Chen Jingyan has begun to rally under the red banner of the laborers, and we must follow."

After the debate, the atmosphere of combining education with productive labor in the metallography program of Xi'an Jiaotong University was completely renewed. Now, the teachers and students of this program have produced forty-one new achievements in teaching, production, and scientific research.

    结合生产不会降低教学质量
    西安交大金相专业一场答辩使怀疑派甘拜下风
    据新华社西安12日电　记者孙传镐报道：西安交通大学机械冶金系金相专业师生们举行答辩会，对下厂劳动的三年级学生陈景炎参加四个月生产后获得的知识技能等情况，进行了全面的考核和鉴定。
    举行答辩会的缘由是这样的。新学年开始后，金相专业同全校其他各系科一样，仍有少数教师用“万般皆下品，唯有理论高”的老秤来衡量教学质量。他们认为金相专业是工科中的理科，结合生产劳动必然会降低教学质量。一部分五年级学生也在大字报上写道：下车间从事生产，学到的是重复的简单劳动，只能培养出无知识或半知识的劳动者。
    金相专业党支部研究了这种情况，决定以下放在本校热处理车间劳动的三年级学生陈景炎为对象，组织一次群众性的公开答辩会，让事实来说话：孰是孰非。是提高了教学质量，还是降低了教学质量。
    当陈景炎简要地向大会汇报了下厂劳动四个月的收获后，答辩就开始了。答辩委员会主席、系主任周惠久首先发问：钢的检验方法有几种，陈景炎起初不免有点紧张，他略微镇定了一下说道：钢的检验一般有火花检验、金相检验和化学分析等。
    “防止工件淬火变形的实际操作有哪几种方法？”“各种牌号钢的热处理怎样进行？”答辩委员会的委员一个又一个提出了问题。
    陈景炎依然有条不紊地逐题作了回答。他在解释各类牌号钢的热处理过程时，还根据自己实际操作的结果，举出了好几处书本不符合实际的地方。
    人们又问：珠光体（一种金相组织）有几项混合物？陈景炎答道：从显微镜观察，证明珠光体有碳化物和体素铁两项混合物。
    问题一个比一个深，陈景炎并没有为这些专业理论问题难倒，他都一一对答如流。关于珠光体这问题，据说过去一个老教授曾错误地认为只有一项混合物，陈景炎这个学生却答对了。这件事使在场的许多学生惊讶不已，其中有些问题他们还听不懂。在劳动中锻炼过的陈景炎，经受了考验，他在会上熟练而正确地回答了教师和同学们提出的三十多个关于热处理工艺方面的问题。
    对陈景炎的答辩结束了，接着热处理车间负责人、下放教师刘静华发言。她列举了许多事实，介绍了陈景炎通过劳动，在政治、身体和业务几方面起的变化。刘静华说：“大家了解，陈景炎过去是不大过问政治的，看问题比较偏激，可是现在他坚决要求参加共青团，工作中遇到困难也不叫苦，并能主动帮助其他同学。他的健康情况也好了。陈景炎的业务知识也提高得很快，他不但能正确地制订各种热处理的工艺过程，并且还能独立分析处理某些复杂工件。几个月来，他还掌握了不少比较精密的仪器，结合生产中的问题，阅读了“金相热处理”等图书杂志。刘静华问道：从这些事实看，谁能说参加劳动降低了质量呢？
    经过讨论和综合研究了大家的发言，答辩委员会对陈景炎在劳动锻炼中的收获给予评价是：“几个月来，陈景炎在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到了发展，从他答辩的成绩考核，陈景炎在热处理工艺方面的操作技术已相等于一个四级技工的水平，并且他已比较牢固地掌握了一定的金相专业理论。
    答辩会的事实，仿佛给那些“质量降低论者”、“曲线饱和论者”的脑袋，来了一次原子爆炸，他们的“理论”全部被粉碎了。教研组主任俞德刚在会上说：“这次答辩会，给热处理这门课程指引了正确的方向。”他对过去教学中重理论轻实际的情况作了检查，表示今后也要到车间和同学一起劳动。以前，一直主张学校要以教育为纲，认为教育结合生产劳动不符合多快好省原则的五年级学生刘龙章跳上台来，第一句话就说：“我们甘拜下风，服输了。”她说：“我们班次虽然比陈景炎高，到了车间连炉子也生不着，钢的牌号书本上背的烂熟，见了实物就干瞪眼。陈景炎同学已开始到劳动者的红旗下集合，我们也要跟上去。”
    答辩会以后，西安交通大学金相专业教育结合生产劳动的气象为之一新。现在，这个专业的师生，在教学、生产和科学研究方面已经拿出四十一项新成就了。
