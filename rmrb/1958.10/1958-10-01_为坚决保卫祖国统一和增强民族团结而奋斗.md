    Strive to Resolutely Defend the Unification of the Motherland and Enhance National Unity
    By Bainqen Erdini
    The National Day of 1958 has arrived, and the people of Tibet, along with people from all over the country, are celebrating this glorious festival with cheers.
    In the past nine years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have not only achieved national independence and unification, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, but also, on the basis of the victories of a series of socialist transformation endeavors, achieved rapid development in political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings, thus enabling our country to get rid of poverty and backwardness and embark on the road to prosperity and happiness. Especially after the nationwide rectification campaign, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, we are experiencing a great era where one day equals twenty years. The soaring enthusiasm of the people is driving our country's socialist cause to develop by leaps and bounds at a speed never seen before in history. Therefore, whether on the agricultural front, the industrial front, or in national defense construction and the establishment of a modernized and powerful armed force, astonishing miracles have been created and brilliant victories have been achieved. First and foremost are the tremendous achievements on the agricultural front. This year, our country has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain, with a total output expected to reach 600 billion to 700 billion jin, an increase of 60% to 90% compared to 1957. The average grain possession per capita nationwide will reach approximately 1,000 jin, with the total output of wheat alone exceeding that of the United States. Now, the upsurge of establishing people's communes is unfolding magnificently in rural areas across the country. The people's commune system, which integrates workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers into one, under unified leadership and management, will more effectively promote the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, thereby accelerating the development of agricultural mechanization and electrification. China's steel industry, inspired by the Party's general line for building socialism, is developing by leaps and bounds this year thanks to the infinite revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country. The recent enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party decided to call on the people of the whole country to strive for the magnificent goal of producing 10.7 million tons of steel. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country will surely achieve this victory and catch up with and surpass Britain in less than fifteen years.
    Currently, in the international situation where the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, socialist camp countries are developing by leaps and bounds, and the national liberation movement against imperialism is constantly surging. Imperialism is constantly being defeated. However, the imperialists are unwilling to accept their defeat. Recently, the absurd and shameless statement by the American warmonger Dulles and the armed provocations by American imperialism in the Taiwan Strait region are not only armed interference in our country but also a serious threat to world peace. Therefore, it has once again aroused the immense indignation and condemnation of the people of our country and peace-loving people around the world. Premier Zhou's statement on the situation in the Taiwan Strait region fully demonstrates the voice of the powerful 600 million Chinese people. Our government and people have every right to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands, which are inseparable parts of our country. This is our internal affair and allows no interference from American imperialism. Our just struggle has received the support of countries in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as Arab countries and countries and peoples who love peace in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and around the world. This is a powerful guarantee for safeguarding peace. If the imperialists and their lackeys dare to continue expanding the flames of war in the Middle East or the Taiwan Strait region, they are bound to play with fire and burn themselves. As Chairman Mao said at the Supreme State Conference: "If the American monopoly capitalist group persists in its policy of aggression and war, it is bound to be sentenced to death by hanging by the people of the world one day, and the same will be true of other American accomplices."
    Since the peaceful liberation, under the correct leadership and kind concern of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of Tibet have not only been freed from the enslavement of imperialism forever, but also, under the leadership of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC and with the strong support of the people of the whole country, especially with the faithful implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement by all comrades working in Tibet, national unity has been strengthened day by day, border defense has been consolidated day by day, and great achievements have been made in developing Tibet's political, economic, and cultural affairs and cultivating ethnic minority cadres. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in April 1956, ushering in a thriving new atmosphere in the Tibet region of the motherland and opening up a broad avenue for the Tibetan people to move towards a socialist society.
    It is clearly stipulated in the Seventeen-Article Agreement that the Tibetan people should unite to drive the aggressive forces of imperialism out of Tibet and return to the big family of the People's Republic of China. However, counter-revolutionary elements and reactionaries, instigated and directed by American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, have betrayed the motherland and sold out the interests of the Tibetan people, and have been carrying out sabotage activities in the Tibet region. Their crimes have not only seriously undermined the peaceful agreement, but are also counter-revolutionary crimes of betraying the country and resisting the socialist road, seriously undermining the unification of the motherland and national unity. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland and the people of Tibet, and they will surely suffer a shameful defeat.
    All monks and laypeople in Tibet must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, further consolidate the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, strengthen practical actions against imperialism and love for the country, thoroughly implement the Seventeen-Article Agreement, resolutely safeguard the unification of the motherland and national unity, resolutely smash the conspiracies and sabotage activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, and strive for our road to a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    为坚决保卫祖国统一和增强民族团结而奋斗
    班禅额尔德尼
    1958年的国庆节来到了，西藏人民和全国各地人民群众，都为这个光荣节日而欢呼庆祝。
    九年来，我国各族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的英明领导下，不仅实现了国家的独立和统一，巩固了我国人民民主专政，并在一系列社会主义改造事业的胜利基础上，政治、经济、文化等事业，都得到了迅速的发展，从而使我们的国家摆脱了贫困与落后的状态，走向了繁荣幸福的道路。尤其在全民整风运动以后，我国各族人民在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，我们正在经历着一天等于二十年的伟大时期，人民群众的冲天干劲，推动着我国的社会主义事业以历史上从来没有看见过的高速度飞跃的向前发展。所以，无论在农业战线上、工业战线上和国防建设及建立现代化的强大武装力量等方面，都创造了惊人的奇迹，获得了辉煌的胜利。首先是农业战线上的巨大成就，今年我国粮食空前丰收，总产量要达六千亿斤到七千亿斤，比1957年增产60％至90％，全国每人占有粮食的平均数将达一千斤左右，其中小麦的总产量，就已超过了美国。现在，办人民公社的高潮，正波澜壮阔的在全国农村展开，把工农商学兵合为一体，统一领导和管理的人民公社制度，更能有力地促进工农业大跃进，从而加速农业机械化、电气化的发展过程。我国的钢铁工业，今年在党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，由于全国人民无穷的革命干劲，正在飞跃发展，中国共产党政治局最近举行的扩大会议决定，号召全国人民为生产一千零七十万吨钢的宏伟目标而奋斗。在党的正确领导下，全国人民必将取得这一胜利，并在不到十五年的时间内赶上和超过英国。
    现在，在东风继续压倒西风的国际形势下，社会主义阵营各国正在飞跃发展，反对帝国主义的民族解放运动正在不断高涨，帝国主义在不断的遭到失败。但是，帝国主义者，对他们的失败是不甘心的，最近美国战争贩子杜勒斯荒谬无耻的声明和美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区的武装挑衅，不仅是对我国人民的武装干涉，也是对世界和平的严重威胁；因此，又一次地激起了我国人民与全世界爱好和平人民的无比愤恨与谴责。我国周总理关于台湾海峡地区局势的声明，充分显示着强大六亿中国人民的呼声，我国政府和人民完全有权解放我国不可分割的领土台湾和沿海其他岛屿，这是我国内政，绝不允许美帝干涉。我们这种正义的斗争，已得到了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国和阿拉伯各国以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，这是保卫和平的有力保证。帝国主义者和它的仆从，如果敢于在中东或者台湾海峡地区继续扩大战火，势必玩火自焚。正如毛主席在最高国务会议上说的：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天被全世界人民处以绞刑，其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
    和平解放以来，西藏人民在共产党和毛主席的正确领导与亲切的关怀下，西藏人民不仅永远摆脱了帝国主义的奴役，并在中共西藏工委的领导和全国人民的大力支援下，尤其是在藏全体工作同志们忠诚的执行了协议十七条，致使民族团结日益加强，祖国边防日益巩固，并在发展西藏的政治、经济、文化及培养民族干部等事业方面，都获得了巨大的成就。1956年4月间成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，从而在祖国西藏地区出现了欣欣向荣的新气象，开辟了西藏人民走向社会主义社会的大道。
    西藏人民团结起来，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏，西藏人民回到中华人民共和国大家庭中来，这是十七条协议中的明文规定。但是，反革命分子和反动分子在美蒋特务的策动和指使下，他们背叛祖国，出卖西藏人民的利益，在西藏地区阴谋进行破坏活动。他们这种罪行，不仅严重地破坏了和平协议，而且是叛国、抗拒走社会主义道路的反革命罪行，严重地破坏了祖国统一和民族团结。这是祖国各族人民和西藏人民绝不允许的，他们肯定要遭到可耻的失败。
    西藏全体僧俗群众，要更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，进一步巩固汉、藏民族的团结，加强反帝爱国的实际行动，为彻底执行十七条协议，坚决维护祖国统一和民族团结，坚决粉碎美蒋特务分子的阴谋破坏活动，为我们走向繁荣幸福的社会主义道路而奋斗。
