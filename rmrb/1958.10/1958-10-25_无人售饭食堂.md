Unmanned Canteen

    The Daixiu Production Brigade of the Daishan People's Commune in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, has established unmanned canteens based on the general improvement of the communist ideological awareness of its members and their conscious willingness. These canteens have been greatly welcomed by the masses.

    So far, three unmanned canteens have been established. The canteens prepare three meals a day. After work, members go to the canteen to serve themselves, weigh their own portions, and pay with their own meal tickets. This not only reduces the number of canteen staff and frees up more labor for production, but also makes mealtimes more orderly than in the past. Members have reflected, "The unmanned canteen is really good; no queuing, no noise, everyone is satisfied, and everyone eats their fill." (Attached picture)

    无人售饭食堂
    安徽巢县岱山人民公社大秀生产大队，在社员共产主义思想觉悟普遍提高和自觉自愿的基础上，举办了无人售饭食堂，受到群众很大欢迎。
    到目前为止已办起三所无人售饭食堂。食堂里每天将三餐饭做好，社员下工后到食堂来自装、自称、自付饭票，这样不仅可以减少食堂的售饭人员，腾出更多的劳动力投入生产中去，而且开饭时比过去更有秩序。社员们反映说：“无人售饭食堂真正好，不站队，不吵闹，个个满意，人人吃得饱。”（附图片）
