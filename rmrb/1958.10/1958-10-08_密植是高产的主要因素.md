    Dense Planting is the Main Factor for High Yield
    Zhu Guanghuan

    In the past, people always believed that crops could not be planted with high density. If they were too dense, they would not be ventilated or receive enough light, and would be prone to lodging and other problems. Taking wheat as an example, past experiments in places like Shijiazhuang showed that when the sowing rate exceeded 20 jin per mu, the yield increase was not significant, and even decreased. However, this year's high-yield wheat harvests by farmers tell us that when the sowing rate of wheat is increased to 50 jin per mu or even more, it will not only not lodge or decrease yield, but will greatly increase yield. The same is true for corn. Past experiments believed that varieties like Golden Queen, when the density was increased to more than 2,000 plants per mu, often could not increase yield. However, the emergence of high-yield corn areas this year shows that increasing density is one of the main factors in increasing yield. For example, in Funan County, Huaibei, one mu of corn had more than 20,000 plants, and the yield reached more than 5,300 jin.

    The reason why dense planting did not increase yield in the past was mainly due to the neglect of other conditions related to dense planting, such as deep plowing, fertilization, especially the use of phosphate and potash fertilizers. Farmers' practices have proved that by adopting comprehensive technical measures, including increasing density, the yield can be increased by several times, or even dozens of times. This year's rapid development of agriculture has indeed given me a great education, making us realize that our minds must be greatly liberated, and we must treat new things with a new perspective.

    密植是高产的主要因素
    朱光焕
    过去人们总认为作物不能高度密植，如果过于密，就不能通风、透光，并容易发生倒伏等现象。以小麦为例，过去在石家庄等地的试验结果表明，播种量每亩超过二十斤时，增产便不显著，甚至减产。但今年农民的小麦高额丰产事实告诉我们，小麦的播种量增加到每亩五十斤或更大一些时，不但能不倒伏，不减产，反而大大增加了产量。玉米也有同样情况。过去的试验认为像金皇后之类的品种，密度增加到每亩二千株以上时，往往不能增产。但是今年玉米高额丰产地的出现，说明密度加大是增加产量的主要因素之一。如淮北阜南县一亩玉米超过两万株，产量达到五千三百多斤。
    过去密植不增产的理由主要是忽略了和密植有关的其他条件，如深耕、施肥，特别是磷钾肥的使用。农民的实践证明，采用综合的技术措施，其中包括增加密度在内，产量可以提高几倍，甚至几十倍。今年农业飞跃发展确实给了我很大教育。使我们认识到思想必须大解放，必需以新眼光对待新事物。
