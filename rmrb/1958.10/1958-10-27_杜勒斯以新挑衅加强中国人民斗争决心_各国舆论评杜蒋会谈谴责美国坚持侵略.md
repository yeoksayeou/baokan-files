Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th. The "People's Daily" of Vietnam today published a commentary on the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué, condemning the United States for continuing to stubbornly create tension in the Taiwan Strait region and plotting against the People's Republic of China.

The commentary pointed out that in the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué, the United States recognized Chiang Kai-shek as the "true spokesperson" of the Chinese people. This is really a clumsy trick! Yesterday, the United States exhausted bad words to scold the Chiang Kai-shek group as "stupid." Who doesn't know that the United States' means is to use the Chiang Kai-shek group as a tool to serve the United States' aggression and challenge conspiracy?

The commentary said that this meeting exposed the irreconcilable contradictions between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek.

The commentary also said that no cunning conspiracy can shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Mazu. As Vice Premier Chen Yi recently said: "The American attempt to use force to split China, occupy Taiwan, and create 'two Chinas' is bound to fail. The Chinese people want the American aggressors to get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and they must get out." The will of the Chinese people is the will of the people of Asia and the world. It must win victory.
　
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 26th. The Mongolian "Truth Daily" pointed out in an article commenting on the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks communiqué today that the communiqué talks emptily about unity, but cannot hide the differences between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek.

The commentary severely condemned the United States' aggressive act of interfering in China's internal affairs and pointed out that the communiqué once again exposed the United States' fierce face of being enemies with the 600 million Chinese people.

The commentary finally warned the imperialist schemers: No matter how hard they try, they will never be able to stop the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan.
　
Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 25th. Bulgarian newspapers emphasized in articles today that the results of the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks show that the American imperialists continue to take shameless aggressive actions to interfere in China's internal affairs. Any conspiracy of the American aggressors is destined to be shamefully defeated, and the Chinese people's just struggle will inevitably be victorious.

The "Labor Daily" commented that the Dulles-Chiang Kai-shek talks clearly show that the United States is prepared to continue military and political conspiracies against China. They disregard the will of the Chinese people and want to occupy Taiwan forever.

The "Workers' Cause Daily" commented that the US-Chiang Kai-shek communiqué shows that the United States is determined to continue provoking the People's China. The American imperialists want to scare the Chinese people and make the Chinese people submit. This is a dream! The Chinese people are not neurotic. They will neither be intimidated nor deceived.
　
Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 25th. A commentator for the Cairo "Evening News" wrote today that Dulles' statement that the choice between war and peace lies with the Chinese Communists is "the biggest joke of the moment."

The commentator ridiculed Dulles's talk, citing historical facts to prove that Taiwan and the coastal islands are Chinese territory, and listing facts to show that the United States is carrying out military provocations against China.

The commentator asked whether Dulles is really so confused, or deliberately pretending to be so confused. He said that no one in the world believes Dulles's words, and the people of the world sympathize with and support the People's China, and even most Americans disagree with Dulles's aggressive policy toward China.
　
Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 25th. "Alif Ba" wrote in an editorial today: Dulles "never fails to create international crises that threaten world peace and bring the danger of war very close whenever he visits a place; Dulles's recent visit to Taiwan is also like this."

The newspaper condemned Dulles for making a statement "full of challenges" after returning to the United States from Taiwan. The newspaper then pointed out that Dulles's statement will only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to eliminate the dirty foreign occupiers and those traitorous imperialist agents.

The newspaper pointed out: "Whether Dulles likes it or not, Taiwan will definitely be liberated, because Taiwan belongs to its great motherland - an inseparable part of China." The newspaper pointed out that the Chinese people will never agree to the American army occupying this part of their motherland.

The newspaper concluded: "The Chinese people's struggle is supported by all peace-loving people in the world, and there is no doubt that victory belongs to the Chinese people. Despite Dulles and the Wall Street bosses, Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland."

"Arab Voice" also criticized Dulles's statement after returning from Taiwan as "full of provocations and lies against the Chinese people" in an editorial entitled "The Fox's Tracks" today.

    杜勒斯以新挑衅加强中国人民斗争决心
    各国舆论评杜蒋会谈谴责美国坚持侵略
    新华社河内26日电　越南“人民报”今天就杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈公报发表评论，谴责美国继续顽固地在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势和阴谋反对中华人民共和国。
    评论指出，在杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈公报说，美国承认蒋介石是中国人民的“真正的发言人”。这实在是笨拙的把戏！美国昨天还用尽坏话来谩骂蒋介石集团“愚蠢”。还有谁不知道美国的手段正是要利用蒋介石集团，把它作为替美国的侵略和挑战阴谋服务的工具呢？
    评论说，这次会谈暴露了美蒋之间不可解决的矛盾。
    评论还说，不论任何狡猾的阴谋都不能动摇中国人民解放台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖的决心。正如最近陈毅副总理所说：“美国人企图用武力来分裂中国，霸占台湾，制造‘两个中国’的阴谋是一定要失败的。中国人民要美国侵略者滚出台湾和台湾海峡，它们非滚出去不可”。中国人民的意志就是亚洲和世界人民的意志。它一定要取得胜利。
    新华社乌兰巴托26日电　蒙古“真理报”今天在一篇评论杜勒斯和蒋介石会谈公报的文章里指出，公报空谈团结，但掩盖不住杜勒斯和蒋介石之间的分歧。
    评论严厉谴责了美国干涉中国内政的侵略行为，并指出，公报再次暴露了美国与六亿中国人民为敌的凶恶面目。
    评论最后警告帝国主义野心家说：不管怎样费尽心机，他们绝阻挠不了中国人民解放台湾的决心。
    新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚的报纸今天在文章中强调指出，杜勒斯和蒋介石的会谈结果表明，美国帝国主义者继续采取无耻的侵略行动来干涉中国内政。美国侵略者的任何阴谋都注定要遭到可耻的失败，中国人民的正义斗争必然获得胜利。
    “劳动报”的评论说，杜蒋会谈明显地表明，美国准备对中国继续进行军事和政治阴谋。他们无视中国人民的意志，想永远占领台湾。
    “工人事业报”的评论说，美蒋会谈公报表明，美国决心对人民中国继续挑衅。美国帝国主义者想吓唬中国人民，要使中国人民屈服，这是梦想！中国人民不是神经衰弱者，他们既不会被吓倒，也不会受迷惑。
    新华社开罗25日电　开罗“晚报”评论员今天写道，杜勒斯所说的选择战争还是选择和平，都在于中国共产党人的话“是当前最大的笑话”。
    评论员嘲笑杜勒斯的谈话，他举出了历史事实证明台湾和沿海岛屿是中国的领土，又列举了事实说明美国对中国进行军事挑衅。
    评论员问，杜勒斯究竟真是糊涂到了这种地步呢，还是故意装作这样糊涂。他说，世界上没有一个人相信杜勒斯的话，全世界的人民都同情和支持人民中国，甚至美国绝大部分人都不同意杜勒斯对中国的侵略政策。
    新华社大马士革25日电　“阿利夫巴报”今天在社论中写道：杜勒斯“每访问一个地方总是免不了制造威胁世界和平的国际危机，并且使战争危险非常迫近；杜勒斯最近对台湾的访问也是这样”。
    这家报纸谴责杜勒斯从台湾回美国后发表“充满了挑战”的声明。报纸接着指出，杜勒斯的声明只会使中国人民加强他们清除肮脏的外国占领军和那些卖国的帝国主义代理人的决心。
    这家报纸指出：“不管杜勒斯喜欢不喜欢，台湾一定会被解放，因为台湾是属于它的伟大的祖国——中国的不可分割的一部分”。报纸指出，中国人民决不会同意美国军队占领他们祖国的这一部分。
    报纸最后说：“中国人民的斗争得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持，毫无疑问，胜利属于中国人民。尽管有杜勒斯和华尔街老板们，台湾终将回到祖国的怀抱。”
    “阿拉伯之声报”今天在一篇题为“狐狸的行踪”的社论里，也抨击杜勒斯从台湾回国后发表的声明是“充满了反对中国人民的挑衅和谎话”。
