Even with Limbs Missing, Strive to Be a Model Worker
Amazing Production Achievements of Residents at the Henan Disabled Veterans Rehabilitation Center

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, October 13th) The residents of the Henan Revolutionary Disabled Veterans Rehabilitation Center, with revolutionary optimism and a determination not to be useless despite their disabilities, are, like the people of the whole country, engaged in the magnificent cause of building socialism with soaring enthusiasm. They sing aloud: "Not afraid of being over sixty, not afraid of missing limbs; transform old age into youth, transform severe disabilities into mild disabilities; be the hero among heroes, be the good man among good men."

These most beloved people have created many astonishing miracles on the production front that people would not dare to imagine. When production began, Zhao Qiqing, who had both upper limbs amputated, was afraid that he would not have a share, so he repeatedly asked the leaders of the center: "Is there any work for me? If everyone else participates in production and there is no work for me, I can't stand it." He went to the hemp spinning workshop several times a day to observe and see if there was any work he could do. He said to the director: "I have no arms, but my shoulders are okay. I can carry baskets and sacks." Yang Xifang, who was paralyzed in the lower limbs, went to Shanghai for treatment. The center's Communist Youth League secretary wrote to him about the enthusiasm for production in the center, and he asked the doctor to cure him quickly so he could be discharged. After he returned from treatment in Shanghai, the leaders asked him to continue his recuperation, but he made every effort to participate in production.

Those who participated in production were stronger than the others. The burlap bag factory's hemp spinning workshop stipulated that each person should work six hours a day, but they took the initiative to request eight hours of work. In the hemp spinning workshop, comrades who were blind were given hemp by caregivers, but they felt that it was too slow for the caregivers to distribute the hemp one by one, which delayed production, so they weighed the hemp themselves. Although they were blind, they could accurately weigh the hemp according to their experience, carry it to their workshop, and start production immediately. At mealtime, some people felt that the time spent queuing for food and buying vegetables was too long and affected production, so they drank a bowl of soup first, picked up a steamed bun, and went to production while eating. Zhao Yongxiang, who was blind in the rope-making workshop, not only produced like everyone else, but also quickly learned how to repair machines.

These most beloved people also squeezed out time from their work to engage in agricultural activities. They reclaimed open spaces inside and outside the center and along the roadside, reclaiming a total of sixty mu of wasteland. After the wasteland was reclaimed, they combined it with the health campaign to accumulate fertilizer, and cleared more than 140 carts of garbage from the center alone. When sending fertilizer to the fields and pushing water to fight drought, the blind comrades became the main force in pulling carts and transporting manure; those with lower limb disabilities also actively used hand-cranked tricycles specially designed for the severely disabled to transport water. What is even more touching is that Luo Hongbin, Huang Ziliang, and other comrades who had their ten fingers amputated used their remaining small finger stumps to plant beans, pick castor seeds, and pull weeds; people thought that Zhao Qiqing, Zhao Wenli, and others who had their upper limbs amputated could not participate in field labor, but they insisted on participating, using their toes to pick out grain seedlings, pull weeds, and turn sweet potato seedlings. After their tenacious struggle together with the staff and family members, the original plan of 21 mu of wheat with an average yield of 250 jin per mu resulted in an average yield of 417 jin per mu; the highest yield was equivalent to 1,383 jin per mu.

These most beloved people also used their infinite wisdom to continuously improve tools in order to improve production efficiency. Yang Quanzhong, who had one leg amputated and a finger fractured on one hand, learned to sew. After he modified a ruler, he was able to measure and cut. The rope-making team modified a rope-making machine, and the hemp-spinning team imitated a wooden electric spinning machine, both of which improved efficiency by three or four times and greatly reduced labor intensity.

The quality and efficiency of their products are not only not lower than the production of ordinary people, but some are even higher than the products of ordinary people. The cotton blankets they weave are very popular and have been sold to Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet. The highest weight of castor silkworms in the country is 9 grams each in Anhui, but the castor silkworms raised in this center reached more than 10 grams each. The small rope-making machines produced 35 jin per shift, and the large machines produced 80 jin per shift, both of which became the highest records for rope-making in Xinxiang City.

Their valuable labor has made a good contribution to the construction of the motherland. The 39 residents in the rope-making workshop produced more than 30,000 jin of rope in just two months, with a value of more than 25,000 yuan; the silkworm seeds and cocoons bred by the silkworm-raising team can generate a total income of about 3,000 yuan this year. The total output value of various production activities in the center this year can reach more than 720,000 yuan, and can accumulate more than 100,000 yuan of funds; next year, it can accumulate to 190,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the entire annual expenditure of the center, turning a consumption unit into a production unit.

In order to rapidly develop the center's production and construction, they also actively invested. Wang Yunshan, an old Red Army cadre, took out 2,400 yuan of savings to invest; Li Yongfu, a specially disabled person, a model for literacy in Henan Province, and a model for eliminating the four pests in Xinxiang City, also invested 400 yuan; they invested nearly 30,000 yuan in total, which powerfully accelerated the development of production and construction in the center.

Where does their drive come from? Li Jinfu, a first-class disabled person, and Li Wenzhong, who is blind, said: In the past, politics was not in command. When we were disabled, we were very pessimistic and felt that we could no longer contribute to the revolution. We were confused and didn't care about anything. After rectification, we studied the general line, and politics was in command. The Party proposed production, and we had a direction. Pang Yongxun, a specially disabled person, said: "We were injured in the past to build socialism; now we participate in production to build socialism, so of course we must actively participate."

The center currently has 193 residents, most of whom are severely disabled personnel injured in the War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and some retired old Red Army cadres; 85 staff members, including 14 first- and second-class disabled veterans; and 313 family members of residents and staff. After production started, the residents not only had great enthusiasm and remarkable achievements, but also felt that they were still useful people because their lives were enriched, and they could continue to contribute to the revolution. As a result, a new trend emerged in which everyone studied politics, culture, and technology, and everyone talked about production. The relationship between residents and staff became closer; various production jobs and various physical aspects of different disabilities could also cooperate well, and revolutionary competitions were carried out on the basis of unity.

Now the center has decided to add milk powder, canvas, chicken raising, duck raising, and other production categories on the basis of existing production. In terms of technological innovation, further improve and equip production machinery suitable for the physical conditions of the residents. In terms of culture and entertainment, a Red and Expert University has been established, requiring that red and expert standards be reached within five years; a newly established amateur performance team has officially performed. All measures are striving to achieve a happy center with good politics, high culture, more production, and a fulfilling and rich life. (Attached pictures)

    哪怕四肢残缺　要做劳动模范
    河南残废军人教养院的休养员生产成绩惊人
    本报郑州13日电　河南省革命残废军人教养院的休养员以革命的乐观主义，抱着残而不废的决心，和全国人民一样，以冲天的干劲，在大干着建设社会主义的豪迈事业。他们高唱着：“不怕年过花甲，哪怕四肢残缺；要变老年为青年，变重残为轻残；要做英雄中的英雄，要做好汉中的好汉”。
    这些最可爱的人在生产战线上，做出许多为人们不敢想像的惊人奇迹。开始进行生产时，截去了双上肢的赵启清唯恐没有自己的份儿，就一再问院的领导干部道：“有没有我的活？要是人家都参加了生产，没有我的活，我受不了。”他一天几次到纺麻线车间去观察，看是否有他能做的活。他对院长说：“我没有手臂，我的肩膀还行，我可以抬筐、背麻袋。”下肢瘫痪的杨西方到上海去治病，教养院的团支书曾去信告诉他院中的生产干劲，他就要求医师快给他治好，快出院。他从上海治病回来后，领导上让他继续休养，他就多方活动参加生产。
    参加了生产的，一个比一个强。麻袋厂纺麻线车间规定每人每天劳动六小时，他们主动要求劳动八小时。在纺麻经车间里，双目失明的同志，都由照顾员给他们分麻，但是他们嫌照顾员一份份分配麻太慢，耽误生产，就亲自称麻。他们虽然双目失明了，却能根据经验，自己摸索着秤杆准确的称了麻，背到自己车间去立即生产。吃饭时，有的嫌排队等饭买菜时间长影响生产，就先喝碗汤，拿起馒头，边吃边走着又去生产了。打麻绳车间双目失明的赵永祥不但和大家一样生产，他还很快的学会了修理机器。
    这些最可爱的人在工作中还挤出时间从事农业活动。他们把院内外和路边的空地开垦起来，一共开荒六十亩。荒地开垦起来后，他们结合卫生运动积肥，只清理院里的垃圾即达一百四十多车。往田里送肥料和推水抗旱时，失明的同志成了拉车送粪的主要力量；下肢残废者也积极用重残废人专用的手摇三轮车送水。更感动人的是：截去了十指的罗宏斌、黄子亮等同志用仅余的小截手指点种豆子、摘蓖麻籽、拔草；人们认为截去了双上肢的赵启清、赵文礼等不能参加田间劳动了，可是他们非参加不可，他们用脚趾剔谷苗、拔草，用脚翻红薯秧。经过他们和工作人员、家属的顽强奋斗，原计划二十一亩小麦平均亩产二百五十斤，结果平均亩产四百一十七斤；最高的产量合亩产一千三百八十三斤。
    这些最可爱的人还发挥无限的智慧，不断的改良工具，以提高生产效率。下肢去了一条，一只手的手指又骨折的杨全忠学做缝纫工作，他改造了一种尺子后，也能量尺寸和剪裁了。打绳组改装了一部打绳机，纺麻线组仿制了一部木质电动纺织机，都提高工效三、四倍，并使劳动强度大为降低了。
    他们生产的产品质量和生产效率不但不低于一般人的生产，还有的高于目前一般人的产品。他们织的棉毯很受欢迎，已经远销青海、新疆、西藏。全国蓖麻蚕体重最高的为安徽的每个九克，这个院养的蓖麻蚕每个体重达到了十克多。打麻绳的小机子每台班达到三十五斤，大机子每台班达八十斤，都成为新乡市打麻绳的最高纪录。
    他们这些可贵的劳动，已经为祖国建设做出很好的贡献。打麻绳车间的三十九名休养员，仅在两个月中，就生产出麻绳三万多斤，产值达二万五千多元；养蚕组繁殖的蚕子和蚕茧，今年共可收入三千元左右。全院今年的各种生产总产值，可达七十二万多元，可积累资金十万多元；明年可积累到十九万元，相当于全院全年的全部开支，使消费单位变为生产单位。
    他们为了使这个院的生产建设迅速发展，还踊跃投资。红军老干部王云山取出二千四百元的存款投资；特等残废、河南省扫盲模范、新乡市除四害模范李永福也投资四百元；他们共投资近三万元，有力地加速了全院生产建设的发展。
    他们这股干劲是从哪里来的呢？一等残废李金福和双目失明的李文忠说：过去政治没有挂帅，残废了，悲观情绪很大，认为不能再为革命做出贡献了，迷迷糊糊，啥也不管；整风，学了总路线，政治挂了帅，党提出生产，有了方向了。特等残废的庞永勋说：“过去我们受伤，就是为了建设社会主义；现在参加生产，也是为了建设社会主义，当然也要积极参加。”
    这个院现有休养员一百九十三名，他们绝大部分是解放战争和抗美援朝战争负伤的重残人员和一些退休的老红军干部；工作人员八十五名；其中一、二等残废军人十四名；休养员和工作人员的家属三百一十三名。生产开展起来后，休养员不但干劲大，成绩显著，而且他们由于生活内容丰富了，感觉自己仍是有用的人，能继续为革命做出贡献，于是出现人人学政治、文化、技术，个个谈生产的新风尚。休养员和工作人员之间的关系更加密切；各个生产工种之间，各个不同残废的体力方面，也都能很好的协作，并在团结的基础上，开展着革命竞赛。
    现在这个院已经决定在已有的生产基础上，再增加炼乳、帆布、养鸡、养鸭等生产门类。在技术革新方面，进一步改进和装备适合于休养员身体条件的生产机械。文化娱乐方面，成立了红专大学，要求五年内达到红与专；新成立了业余演出队已经正式演出。一切措施，都在为了达到政治好，文化高，生产多，生活美满，丰富多采的幸福院而奋斗。（附图片）
