Vast fertile land is devastated, American planes forcibly occupy it, poor farmers till every inch of land, suffering from famine and poor harvests year after year.

  Industrial and agricultural production is paralyzed.
  Factories and mines are closing down one after another,
  The unemployed are everywhere,
  Futile to even queue for registration.
            (Top Right Picture)
  American soldiers are like jackals,
  Raping, pillaging, and looting rampantly,
  The people's tolerance is limited,
  Anger will bury the enemy.
            (Bottom Left Picture)
  The compatriots of Dachen are truly miserable,
  Forcibly abducted to Taiwan,
  Wandering in destitution at the end of their rope,
  Hearts yearn for the mainland, hoping for peace talks.

    是台湾同胞结束屈辱生活的时候了
    大好良田被摧残，美国飞机强霸占，可怜农民耕寸地，年年歉收受饥寒
              （上左图）
  工农生产已瘫痪。
  厂矿纷纷把门关，
  失业人群到处是，
  排队登记亦徒然。
            （上右图）
  美国官兵如豺狼，
  奸淫掳掠太疯狂，
  人民忍耐有限度，
  怒火要把仇人葬。
            （下左图）
  大陈同胞实凄惨，
  强被劫掳到台湾，
  流离颠沛处绝境，
  心向大陆盼和谈。
