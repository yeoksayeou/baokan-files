Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, October 17th: The National On-Site Conference for Exchanging Experiences in Rapid Construction in the Building Industry opened in Baotou City on the 15th. The purpose of the conference is, through visits to several key construction cities and the exchange of experiences from all over the country, to push the rapid construction movement that has begun to emerge in various places to a climax, making rapid construction a normal construction method in order to adapt to the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country.

Yang Chunmao, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, analyzed the formation and significance of the rapid construction movement at the beginning of the meeting. He said: In recent months, under the inspiration of the general line and on the basis of implementing "two participations and one reform," the vast number of workers in the construction industry have launched a vigorous technical revolution. At present, the vast majority of construction enterprise workers across the country have basically put down their carrying poles, and many enterprises have achieved mechanized and semi-mechanized construction. Construction enterprises have established more than 3,000 factories on their own, producing construction materials such as steel and cement, as well as various construction machinery. Construction workers have launched a "versatile worker" movement, and many units have 70% to 80% of their workers learning two or more skills. These have created conditions for rapid construction. By the end of September, 247 "high-yield satellites" of rapid construction had been launched across the country, including 107 industrial buildings. At present, the rapid construction movement has developed from launching "high-yield satellites" to the stage of large-scale promotion. In September, rapid construction projects accounted for more than 30% of all started projects. Practice has proved that the implementation of rapid construction can generally shorten the construction period by one-half, two-thirds, or even more, labor productivity can be increased by more than one time, the quality of the project is 95% or more excellent, and the construction cost can be reduced by 20% to 30%. It can be seen that rapid construction can not only greatly accelerate the speed of construction, but also comprehensively achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Yang Chunmao pointed out that the mass rapid construction is a revolution in the construction industry. It is a concentrated expression of the comprehensive improvement of the political leadership level, management level, and technical level of construction enterprises. According to the situation of high-speed development of socialist construction in our country, rapid construction should become the normal construction method in our country's construction industry. It is necessary to quickly promote it from points to areas, set off a climax of the mass movement of rapid construction, and realize a "large-scale harvest." This is the key to completing this year's tasks and greater tasks next year.

Yang Chunmao also requested that those important projects that need to be protected from freezing should be the main targets of the current rapid construction, and all preparations for overall construction should be done quickly, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's construction tasks.

    让快速施工经常化
    建筑工程部在包头开现场会议
    据新华社包头17日电　全国建筑业快速施工经验交流现场会议15日在包头市开幕。会议的目的是通过在几个基本建设重点城市的参观和全国各地经验的交流，把各地开始出现的快速施工运动推向高潮，使快速施工成为正常的施工方法，以适应我国社会主义建设高速度发展的形势。
    建筑工程部副部长杨春茂在会议开始时对快速施工运动的形成和意义作了分析。他说：近几个月来，建筑业广大职工在总路线的鼓舞下，在实行“两参一改”的基础上，展开了轰轰烈烈的技术革命。现在，全国绝大多数建筑企业职工基本上放下了扁担，不少企业已经实现了施工机械化和半机械化。各建筑企业自办工厂三千多个，自己生产钢铁、水泥等建筑材料和多种施工机械。建筑工人们开展“多面手”运动，许多单位有70％—80％的工人学会了两种以上的技术。这些都为快速施工创造了条件。到9月底，全国放出的快速施工“高产卫星”已有二百四十七项，其中工业建筑有一百零七项。目前，快速施工运动已经从放“高产卫星”发展到大面积推广的阶段，9月份快速施工的工程已占全部开工工程的30％以上。实践证明，实行快速施工，一般可以缩短工期二分之一、三分之二或更多些，劳动生产率可以提高一倍以上，工程质量95％以上优良，施工成本可以降低20％到30％。可以看出，快速施工不仅能大大加快建设速度，而且能全面作到多快好省。
    杨春茂指出：群众性的快速施工，是建筑业的一个革命。它是建筑企业政治领导水平、管理水平和技术水平全面提高的集中表现。根据我国社会主义建设高速度发展的形势，快速施工应当成为我国建筑业正常的施工方法。要由点到面迅速推广，掀起一个快速施工群众运动的高潮，实现“大面积丰收”，这是我们完成今年任务和明年更大任务的关键。
    杨春茂还要求把那些重要的需要防冻的工程，作为当前快速施工的主要对象，并迅速作好各项总体施工的准备工作，力争完成和超额完成今年的建设任务。
