Xinhua News Agency report: People's communes in Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, are making unified arrangements for vegetable sowing while vigorously carrying out winter planting, appropriately expanding the area for growing vegetables in order to improve the vegetable supply for urban and rural people in various places.

The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires that each county's commune plant vegetables in an area averaging half a mu per household, and also expand some vegetable gardens near basic construction sites. By early October, the entire prefecture had sown more than 420,000 mu of vegetables such as cabbage and radish. The canteens of each commune already have their own vegetable gardens. These vegetable gardens mostly use idle fields, open spaces, and wasteland, with production teams helping to rush plowing and sowing. Each public canteen draws one or two people specifically responsible for the management of the vegetable garden, such as weeding and fertilizing. In communes near towns and basic construction sites, specialized vegetable production teams have also been established, specifically allocating part of the land as vegetable gardens.

Xinhua News Agency report: In order to ensure the supply of vegetables, Shucha People's Commune in Shucheng County, Anhui, has organized special personnel to plant them. Now the entire commune has planted 6,725 mu of various vegetables. The commune requires that from now until the spring of next year, about half a year, each person can have 1,000 catties of vegetables. In addition to being able to eat one catty of fresh vegetables per person per day, they also plan to make some dried vegetables and pickles.

The Shucha People's Commune has 8,607 households, and the entire commune has established 316 public canteens. Under the slogan of "both cook good meals and grow good vegetables," all public canteens in the commune promptly carried out sowing. Now the vegetable garden of each public canteen is a lush green, and various vegetables are growing very well. (Attached picture)

    既要做好饭　又要种好菜
    人民公社集体食堂建立自己的菜园
    据新华社讯　湖北省襄阳专区各地人民公社在大搞冬播同时，统一安排蔬菜的播种，适当扩大种菜面积，以便改善各地城乡人民的蔬菜供应。
    中共襄阳地委要求各县每个公社种菜的面积要达到平均每户半亩，在基本建设工地附近还要扩大一部分菜园。到10月上旬，全专区已播种了白菜、萝卜等菜蔬四十二万多亩。各公社的食堂都已经有自己的菜园。这些菜园大都是利用闲场、空地和荒地，由生产队帮助突击翻耕、播种，各公共食堂抽出一到二人专门负责菜园的除草、施肥等管理工作。在城镇和基本建设工地附近的公社，还建立了蔬菜生产的专业队，专门划出部分土地做菜园。
    据新华社讯　安徽舒城县舒茶人民公社为了保证蔬菜供应，组织专人栽种，现在全社已种各种蔬菜六千七百二十五亩。这个公社要求从现在到明年春季约半年时间内，每人能有一千斤菜，除平时每人一天能吃到一斤新鲜蔬菜以外，还准备制做一部分干菜和咸菜。
    舒茶人民公社有八千六百零七户，全社已成立三百一十六个公共食堂。全社各个公共食堂在“既要做好饭，又要种好菜”的口号下，及时进行了播种。现在每个公共食堂的菜园已是一片翠绿，各种蔬菜都生长得很好。（附图片）
