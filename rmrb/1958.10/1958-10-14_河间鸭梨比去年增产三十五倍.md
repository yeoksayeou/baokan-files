Hejian Ya pears, famous throughout the country, launched a giant "satellite" with a yield of 124,693 jin per mu in Dongshijing Village, Shijingcun Township. The entire cooperative has 342 mu of pear trees, with 8,000 mature trees. This year, the total output is 3.5 million jin, an increase of more than thirty-five times compared to 1957, with an average yield of more than 10,233 jin per mu. Among them, one mu of "satellite" field, with thirty-five pear trees, produced a total of 124,693 jin and three liang of pears, and 80% were first-class quality pears. Two "Guanzi Pear Kings" (named Guanzi Pear because they resemble Mao Guan), the largest pear has grown to one jin and fourteen liang, and it looks promising that it will grow to two jin and four liang. During the picking process, Xiao Guang, Secretary of the CPC Hejian County Committee, Liu Yintong, Deputy Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Resource Utilization Bureau, and more than 30 other people supervised the harvest, weighed the pears on the spot, and measured the land, which was accurate and without error.

    河间鸭梨比去年增产三十五倍
    全国著名的河间大鸭梨，在诗经村乡东诗经村放出了亩产十二万四千六百九十三斤的巨型“卫星”。全社实有梨树三百四十二亩，成树八千株，今年总产量三百五十万斤，比1957年增产三十五倍多，每亩平均产量一万零二百三十三斤多。其中一亩“卫星”田，梨树三十五株，共产梨十二万四千六百九十三斤三两，并且80％是头等好梨。罐子梨王（形似毛罐、故名罐子梨）二棵，最大的梨已长到一斤十四两，看样子长到二斤四两大有希望。在采摘中中共河间县委书记肖光、河北省农林厅资源利用局副局长刘荫桐等共三十余人进行了监收，并当场过秤和丈量了土地，确凿无误。
