Xinhua News Agency, 23rd October: Vice Premier and Marshal Chen Yi said tonight at a reception in honor of the Romanian Military Delegation visiting China that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territories, and there is absolutely no reason for the Americans to run to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. We advocate that the Chinese people should resolve their own affairs peacefully without American interference. To promote this, we temporarily suspended the shelling of Jinmen on October 6th. However, the Americans insisted on interfering in China's internal affairs by sending escorts in violation of orders. Therefore, we resumed the shelling of Jinmen as a form of punishment. Our position is absolutely just. No matter how much effort Dulles puts into his schemes, our patriotic and just stance will eventually prevail. The American attempt to use force to split China, occupy Taiwan, and create "two Chinas" is bound to fail. The Chinese people want the American aggressors to get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait; they must get out.

This reception was held by Marshal Chen Yi to bid farewell to the Romanian Military Delegation visiting China, which is about to return home.

Marshal Chen Yi said that our people are fighting on two fronts: on the one hand, we are going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, while also preparing conditions for the transition to communism; on the other hand, we are also resolutely fighting against the American aggressors to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, and to complete the reunification of our motherland. Our task is arduous, but we are confident that we will be able to accomplish the great historical mission of building our country and fully reunifying it. We believe that the vast majority of Chinese people will be able to unite under the banner of patriotism and realize the unification of our great motherland.

Marshal Chen Yi expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the Romanian Military Delegation's visit to China, which has further strengthened the mutual understanding and deep friendship between the people and armies of China and Romania, and for the sincere and strong support given by the fraternal Romanian people to the Chinese people in their struggle against the American aggressors.

In his speech, General Salajan said that the actions taken by the People's China to recover its own territory are absolutely just, and the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands is the sacred and inviolable right of the Chinese people. The Romanian people and the government of the Romanian People's Republic, along with all socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, sympathize with and support the struggle of the Chinese people.

General Salajan said that we firmly believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people and their army will achieve greater and greater successes on the road to socialism, and further strengthen the strength and power of the People's China and our entire socialist camp led by the great Soviet Union.

The speeches of Marshal Chen Yi and General Salajan were repeatedly met with warm applause.

Present at the reception were Senior General Huang Kecheng, Senior General Zhang Aiping, Senior General Peng Shaohui, Senior General Guo Tianmin, Senior General Li Jukui, Air Force Senior General Liu Yalou, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shun Chu, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, among others.

Romanian Ambassador to China, Ludenko, and military attachés from various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the reception.

At 3:00 p.m. this afternoon, Senior General Huang Kecheng, Vice Minister of National Defense and Chief of the General Staff, received all members of the Romanian Military Delegation visiting China, headed by General Salajan, and accepted the gifts presented by the delegation to our Ministry of National Defense.

    陈毅副总理在欢送罗军事代表团招待会上说
    中国人的事不要美国人插手
    不管杜勒斯花尽多少心机，分裂中国霸占台湾的阴谋一定要失败
    新华社23日讯　国务院副总理陈毅元帅今晚在欢送罗马尼亚访华军事代表团的招待会上说，台、澎、金、马是中国的领土，美国人跑到台湾和台湾海峡是完全没有道理的。我们主张，中国人的事，由中国人自己来和平解决，不应该让美国人来插手。为了促进这一点，我们在10月6日暂时停止了对金门的炮击，但是美国人硬要插手中国内政，违令护航，因此，我们又恢复了对金门的炮击，以示惩罚。我们的立场是绝对正义的。不管杜勒斯花尽多少心机，我们这一爱国的正义立场终于要取得胜利。美国人企图用武力来分裂中国，霸占台湾，制造“两个中国”的阴谋是一定要失败的。中国人民要美国侵略者滚出台湾和台湾海峡，它们非滚出去不可。
    这个招待会，是陈毅元帅为欢送即将回国的罗马尼亚访华军事代表团而举行的。
    陈毅元帅说，我国人民正在两条战线上进行着斗争，一方面我们正在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义，同时，还为过渡到共产主义准备条件；另一方面，我们还在为反对美国侵略者，解放台、澎、金、马完成祖国统一进行着坚决的斗争。我们的任务是艰巨的，但是我们有信心一定能够完成这建设祖国、使祖国完全统一的伟大的历史任务。我们相信，绝大多数的中国人一定能够在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，实现我们伟大祖国的统一。
    陈毅元帅对罗马尼亚军事代表团这次访问我国进一步加强了中罗两国人民和军队之间的相互了解和深厚友谊，以及兄弟的罗马尼亚人民在中国人民反对美国侵略者的斗争中给予中国人民的真诚和有力的支持，表示衷心的感谢。
    萨拉扬上将致词中说，人民中国为收复自己的领土所采取的行动是绝对正义的，解放台湾和沿海岛屿，是中国人民神圣不可侵犯的权利。罗马尼亚人民和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府，与以苏联为首的所有社会主义国家，都同情和支持中国人民的斗争。
    萨拉扬上将说，我们深信，中国人民及其军队，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导之下，将在社会主义道路上获得愈来愈大的成就，并使得人民中国以及以伟大苏联为首的我们整个社会主义阵营的力量和威力进一步加强。
    陈毅元帅和萨拉扬上将的讲话，不断受到热烈的掌声。
