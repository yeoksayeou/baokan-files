Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th: Macao news: Many Macao social organizations held rallies or issued statements, hoping that the Taiwan authorities would prioritize the interests of the country and the nation, stand with the 600 million people of the country, and jointly drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan.

　　At a gathering held on the evening of the 15th by more than 1,000 directors, supervisors, and worker representatives from various Macao trade unions, Liang Pei, chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, exposed the "ceasefire" conspiracy being played by the United States as an attempt to deceive. He pointed out that China is not at war with the United States, and there is no fire to cease. The only way to eliminate the tension in the Taiwan Strait region is for the U.S. troops to get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region. He hopes that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek Group will recognize the general trend, seize the opportunity, and resolutely break away from U.S. control.

　　The Macao Women's Federation, business community, and teachers from various schools have also held gatherings in the past three days, and well-known figures from all walks of life have also issued written statements. They unanimously believe that after Minister Peng Dehuai put forward the proposal for peace talks with the Taiwan authorities, the internal problems of China and the problems between China and the United States have become more clearly distinguished. They pointed out that the United States is not qualified to talk to us about a "ceasefire." What the Americans should do is to stop military provocations in the Taiwan Strait region and withdraw all armed forces. They all hope that the Taiwan authorities will understand who the real enemies of the Chinese people are, stand on a patriotic position, face reality, and make a wise decision quickly.

　　Since mid-September, Macao compatriots from all walks of life have launched a tide of anger against U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, and various social organizations have successively held protest rallies. Newspapers have been publishing extensive coverage of the gatherings of various groups and statements made by people from all walks of life every day. During this period, Macao compatriots from all walks of life also launched a signature campaign against American aggression. By the beginning of October, the number of people participating in rallies and signing petitions had exceeded 32,000.

    澳门同胞集会谴责美国干涉我国内政
    劝告台湾当局认清大势作出明智抉择
    新华社广州18日电　澳门消息：澳门许多社会团体举行集会或发表谈话，希望台湾当局以国家民族利益为重，和全国六亿人民站在一起，共同把美国侵略者赶出台湾去。
    在澳门各业工会理监事、工人代表一千多人15日晚间举行的集会上，澳门工会联合总会理事长梁培，揭露美国玩弄的“停火”阴谋，是企图鱼目混珠。他指出，中国同美国没有打仗，根本无火可停，消除台湾海峡地区紧张局势的唯一办法，就是美国军队从台湾和台湾海峡地区滚出去。他希望台湾蒋介石集团认清大势，掌握时机，坚决摆脱美国的控制。
    澳门妇女联合会、工商界和各校教师，最近三天来也都分别举行了集会，各界知名人士还发表了书面谈话。他们一致认为，在彭德怀部长提出同台湾当局举行和平谈判的建议以后，中国内部问题和中美之间的问题，就更加清楚地区别开来了。他们指出，美国没有资格同我们谈“停火”，美国人应该做的就是停止在台湾海峡地区的军事挑衅和撤出一切武装力量。他们都希望台湾当局弄清楚谁是中国人民真正的敌人，站在爱国立场，正视现实，赶快作出明智的抉择。
    从9月中旬以来，澳门各界同胞就掀起了反对美国干涉我国内政的怒潮，各个社会团体都先后举行了抗议集会。报纸上每天都以大量篇幅刊登各团体的集会情况和各界人士发表的谈话。在这期间，澳门各界同胞还展开了反对美国侵略的签名运动。到10月上旬，参加集会和签名的人数已超过三万两千人。
