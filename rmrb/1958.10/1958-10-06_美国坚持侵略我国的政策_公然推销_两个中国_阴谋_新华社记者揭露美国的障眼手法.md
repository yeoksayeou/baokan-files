Xinhua News Agency, October 4th dispatch: A commentary by a Xinhua News Agency reporter:

    The Chinese and American ambassadors held another two and a half hour meeting in Warsaw today. This is the seventh meeting they have held since resuming talks there.

    Prior to the meeting, the head of the U.S. government issued a series of statements attempting to create the impression that the United States was changing its insane policy toward the Far East. But a careful study of these statements reveals that they are not only self-contradictory, but none of them indicate any change in the substance of U.S. policy.

    According to these statements, first, the United States will continue to霸占 (illegally occupy) Chinese territory Taiwan and Penghu; will continue to expand its aggression to China's coastal islands, and even to the Chinese coast; and will use the threat of war with China to counter China's efforts to liberate its own territory and exercise its sovereign rights.

    Second, the U.S. government will continue to force the implementation of a "ceasefire" plan in order to cover up the activities of U.S. aggressor troops and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's forces and the U.S. plan to invade China, while at the same time tying China's hands in defending itself and recovering its own territory.

    Dulles' suggestion of reducing Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupying Jinmen and Mazu as a condition for a "ceasefire" is merely a means for the United States to achieve these sinister goals.

    Dulles and other U.S. government leaders use two absurd and ridiculous arguments to defend their position.

    First, the United States attempts to force the other party to accept the view that a "ceasefire" means peace. In reality, this means that China abandons its right to punish the Chiang Kai-shek group's provocations, safeguard national security, and liberate its territory from the hands of U.S. aggressors and Kuomintang traitors. Such a "ceasefire" will not bring peace, but will only cover up aggression and provocation, and lead to war.

    Second, the United States attempts to force the other party to accept the view that the Chiang Kai-shek group is another independent country existing in parallel with the People's Republic of China. In reality, the Chiang Kai-shek government was overthrown by the Chinese people nine years ago, and this small remnant traitorous group of Chiang Kai-shek cannot survive even for a day without U.S. military protection. The U.S. aggressors occupied Taiwan, supported his puppet Chiang Kai-shek, and then concluded a so-called mutual security treaty with his puppet, enabling U.S. troops to be stationed there in order to take further aggressive actions against the Chinese mainland, or to create "two Chinas" as a means to achieve his ultimate goal—invading the Chinese mainland.

    While negotiating with China at the Warsaw ambassadorial talks, the United States used naked force and threats of war to put pressure on the Warsaw talks in order to achieve its goals. The United States has assembled the largest military force in the Taiwan area since the end of World War II. The Navy and Air Force were hurriedly transferred from the United States, the Middle East, Okinawa and other places to the Taiwan area, equipped with atomic weapons and missiles that have never been used before.

    At the same time, the United States has stepped up military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek group, supplying it with various weapons, including F-100 and F-86F aircraft, eight-inch caliber howitzers, and even weapons such as "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles and "Nike-Hercules" surface-to-air missiles, to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese mainland. Since mid-August, U.S. military aid has reached nearly $100 million.

    In addition, the U.S. military is increasingly directly involved in supporting the Chiang Kai-shek army. The U.S. Air Force has taken over the air defense interception missions in Taiwan from the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force. U.S. Navy patrol fleets have intensified their activities in the Taiwan Strait, threatening the Chinese coast.

    The U.S. Navy and Air Force have stepped up their support for the operation of transporting supplies to the Chiang Kai-shek army in Jinmen, located in the Chinese inland sea. More and larger transport aircraft, including C-119 "Flying Boxcar" transport aircraft, have been used or are being used to maintain the airdrop supply to Jinmen. The number of U.S. warships escorting transport convoys to Jinmen is constantly increasing. U.S. aircraft are covering up the Chiang Kai-shek group's attempts to break through the Jinmen blockade. There are even reports that the U.S. military will take over the entire task of transporting supplies to the Jinmen Chiang bandits from the Chiang Kai-shek army.

    Especially important is that the U.S. Navy and Air Force have violated China's territorial waters and airspace more than 20 times, despite warnings from the Chinese government.

    This is the basic U.S. policy of aggression, which is not only resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, but also by all upright people in the world. This is the serious situation they face as the Chinese ambassador and the American ambassador continue to hold talks one after another. Unless the hands of the U.S. aggressors are restrained, unless the United States changes its policy of aggression, unless the United States withdraws its aggressor troops from the Taiwan area and abandons its intention to create "two Chinas," there will be no hope for easing or eliminating the tension in the Far East.

### 美国坚持侵略我国的政策  公然推销“两个中国”阴谋  新华社记者揭露美国的障眼手法

    美国坚持侵略我国的政策  公然推销“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社记者揭露美国的障眼手法
    新华社4日讯　本社记者的述评：
    中美两国大使今天在华沙又举行了两个半小时的会议。这是他们在那里恢复会谈以来举行的第七次会议。
    在举行会议以前，美国政府首脑发表了一系列声明，企图造成一种印象，好像美国正在改变它对远东的疯狂政策。但是如果对这些声明进行一番仔细的研究，就可以看出这些声明不仅自相矛盾，而且没有一篇表明美国政策的实质有任何改变。
    根据这些声明，第一，美国将继续霸占中国领土台湾和澎湖；将继续把侵略扩大到中国沿海岛屿，甚至扩大到中国沿海；而且以同中国作战相威胁，来对抗中国解放自己的领土的努力和行使主权的权利。
    第二，美国政府将继续强使实现“停火”计划，以便掩盖美国侵略军和蒋介石残余部队的活动和美国侵略中国的计划，另一方面又束缚住中国进行自卫和收复自己的领土的手脚。
    杜勒斯暗示以“停火”为条件来削减蒋介石的窃据金门和马祖的部队，这只是美国企图达到这些阴险的目的的一种手段。
    杜勒斯和其他美国政府领导人用两个荒谬可笑的论点来为他们的立场辩护。
    第一，美国企图强迫对方接受这样的看法：“停火”意味着和平。而实际上，这意味着中国放弃惩罚蒋介石集团的挑衅行动、保障国家安全、从美国侵略者和国民党卖国贼手中解放自己的领土的权利。这样的“停火”不会带来和平，而只会掩护侵略和挑衅行动，并且导致战争。
    第二，美国企图强迫对方接受这样的看法：蒋介石集团是同中华人民共和国平行存在的另一个独立国家。而实际上，蒋介石政府在九年前就被中国人民推翻了，蒋介石这个小小的残余卖国集团如果没有美国的军事保护，就连一天也不能存在下去。美国侵略者占领了台湾，支持他的傀儡蒋介石，然后同他的傀儡缔结了所谓共同安全条约，使美国军队能够驻扎在那里，以便对中国大陆采取进一步的侵略行动，或是制造“两个中国”，作为达到他的最后目的——侵略中国大陆——的一个手段。
    美国一方面在华沙大使级会谈上同中国谈判，一方面却使用了赤裸裸的武力和战争威胁，来对华沙会谈施加压力，以实现它的目的。美国在台湾地区集结了第二次世界大战结束以来最大的军事力量。海军和空军从美国、中东、冲绳和其他地方匆忙调到台湾地区，它们配备着过去从来没有使用过的原子武器和导弹。
    同时，美国加紧对蒋介石集团提供军事援助，供给它各种武器，其中包括F—100型、F 86F型的飞机，八英寸口径榴弹炮，甚至像“响尾蛇”式空对空导弹和“奈克—赫尔克里士”式地对空导弹等武器，用来攻击中国人民解放军和中国大陆。自从8月中旬以来，美国军事援助达到将近一亿美元。
    此外，美国军队越来越直接参与支持蒋介石军队。美国空军已经从蒋介石空军那里接过了在台湾的防空截击任务。美国海军巡逻舰队加紧在台湾海峡的活动，威胁中国的海岸。
    美国海军和空军加紧支持为位于中国内海的金门的蒋介石军队运送供应品的行动已经使用了、或者正在使用更多、更大的运输机，包括C—一一九型“飞行车厢式”运输机在内，来保持对金门的空投供应。护送前往金门的运输船队的美国军舰数目不断增加。美国飞机正在掩护蒋介石集团突破金门封锁线的尝试。甚至有消息说，美国军队将接替蒋介石军队担负起为金门蒋贼军运送供应品的整个任务。
    尤其重要的是，美国海军和空军不顾中国政府的警告，侵犯了中国领海和领空达二十多次。
    这就是美国的基本侵略政策，这种政策不仅遭到中国人民的坚决反对，而且也遭到全世界所有正直的人们的坚决反对。在中国大使和美国大使一次接一次地继续举行会谈的时候，这是他们所面临的严重局势。除非扼住美国侵略者的双手，除非美国改变它的侵略政策，除非美国从台湾地区撤出它的侵略军和放弃它要制造“两个中国”的打算，否则，远东紧张局势就不会有缓和或者消除的希望。
