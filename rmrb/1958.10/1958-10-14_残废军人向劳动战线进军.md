    Disabled revolutionary veterans have been tenaciously fighting against their illnesses and disabilities since the day they were injured. As soon as their health improves, those who have had both lower limbs amputated practice walking with prosthetic legs; those who have lost all ten fingers tie penholders to their wrists and learn to write; those with lower limb paralysis hold onto wheeled parallel bars or use crutches for "functional" exercises. The only desire behind their efforts is to transform themselves into people who are "disabled but not useless," and to be able to contribute to socialism once again. However, their disabled bodies, to some extent, influence and restrain their thoughts, and often form an ideological contradiction with their pressing desire to contribute to socialist construction. In recent years, the high tide of industrial and agricultural construction and the situation of the Great Leap Forward have inspired them, and that contradiction has become even more prominent and obvious. They dislike the "three full meals and a nap" convalescent life, which often leads to reduced appetite and insomnia, directly affecting their physical and mental health.

    How to satisfy the demands of this group of comrades, to merge their full enthusiasm for building socialism with the torrent of the entire people building socialism, to better promote their revolutionary optimism, and thereby transform them into a political force that inspires the broad masses to continuously make revolution - this is a major political task placed before our Party organization, and an unshirkable responsibility for those working in the sanatorium.

    In order to solve this problem, our hospital’s Party General Branch Committee has taken many measures and continuously struggled against all right-leaning conservative ideas. Finally, during the rectification movement, we found the direction for running the hospital, which is to organize production. However, organizing production was not smooth sailing. Initially, when organizing severely disabled personnel to participate in production, we focused solely on the disabilities, fearing that organizing production would affect their physical and mental health, and doubting whether organizing production was the right direction for running the hospital. In order to educate Party cadres and dispel the doubts of workers and convalescents about organizing production, the Party organization organized cadres to study the deeds of Li Laicai, the legless tractor driver, and the labor models such as Xiao Yuhe and Fu Lanchao, special-grade and first-grade disabled veterans respectively, who were scattered in the countryside, and extensively publicized the experience of the Beijing No. 1 Nursing Home and the blind training classes organized by the Blind Welfare Association in fully engaging in production, which enlightened everyone’s thinking about engaging in production. They said, "If they can engage in production, so can we." "Li Laicai is a first-grade disabled person with both lower limbs amputated, and Fu Lanchao is blind. If they can become labor models in production, why can't other comrades become labor models?" In order to further educate cadres and all personnel with facts, we conducted small-scale experiments in raising rabbits, silkworms, and bees. After half a year of practice, it was proved that these productions were basically suitable for the conditions of the severely disabled. They found pleasure in production, felt that life was meaningful, and their physical fitness was also enhanced. They said, "Participating in production not only cured neurasthenia, but also cured ideological illnesses." As a result, they were mentally happy and full of energy. In this way, a preliminary ideological foundation for engaging in production was laid. At the same time, the tenacious will, vigorous revolutionary drive, and revolutionary optimism of those participating in production broke through all habitual forces and also refuted the cynicism of those conservatives, onlookers, and a few ill-intentioned bad elements. Rumors such as "Rabbit Commander, Rabbit Squad Leader, being overly enthusiastic, will not achieve anything, just wait and see" circulated. In a short period of time, only one year, the twenty domestic rabbits developed into more than three hundred, the two bee colonies developed into sixteen colonies, and one sow developed into twenty-seven... In particular, the fact that each participant in production pre-allocated three hundred yuan of dividends and that many comrades learned technology powerfully refuted the erroneous arguments of conservatives and onlookers that "disability means uselessness" and that "sanatoriums cannot engage in production." It greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of convalescents to participate in production, and further enlightened and strengthened our determination to vigorously engage in production.

    However, at this time, only a small number of people participated in production, and only some small-scale sideline productions were carried out. There were still concerns about whether large-scale production could be carried out, whether industry, agriculture, and sideline industries could be greatly developed, and whether more than 95% of the severely disabled could participate in production. Based on the situation of the entire people engaging in large-scale production and combined with the central government's instructions on cadres participating in physical labor, the Party General Branch, under the guiding ideology of believing in the majority of the masses, launched a high tide of airing views and debates with the direction of running the hospital and engaging in large-scale production as the content. During the airing of views and debates, convalescents, in the form of big-character posters, demanded to participate in production and put forward fighting slogans such as "Disabled but not useless, engage in large-scale production" and "Resolutely transform consumption units into production units, transform the disabled into laborers, and march towards production and construction with revolutionary heroism!" At this time, the Party General Branch, according to the demands of the masses, formulated a leaping-forward production plan and mobilized the entire Party and all personnel to write letters of determination and guarantees, and convened a mobilization meeting for a comprehensive shift to production on "May Day," with 95% of the members participating in production. As a result, all arguments for retreat were declared bankrupt.

    In short, organizing severely disabled personnel to participate in production is not without difficulties. The problem lies in constantly struggling against right-leaning conservative ideas, believing in the majority of the masses, relying on the entire Party, and fully mobilizing the masses. Any difficulty can be overcome. In the process of organizing production, as long as the coordination in production and physical strength is carefully organized, the sanatorium can not only engage in agriculture, sideline industries, and horticulture production, but also engage in industrial production.

    残废军人向劳动战线进军
    中共河南省革命残废军人教养院总支书记  李烈
    革命残废军人从伤残那天起，就一直顽强地向病残进行斗争。健康一有恢复，截去双下肢的就练习用假腿走路，截去十手指的把笔杆绑在手腕上学写字，下肢瘫痪的扶着带轮子的双杠或拄着双拐进行“功能”锻炼。他们之所以如此，只有一个愿望，就是要把自己变成“残而不废”的人，能再为社会主义贡献力量。但是，他们残废的身体在某种程度上影响和束缚着他们的思想，也往往同他们再为社会主义建设贡献一分力量的迫切要求形成思想上的矛盾。近年来，工农业建设的高潮和全民大跃进的形势对他们的鼓舞，那种矛盾就更加突出明显了。他们讨厌“三饱一倒”的休养生活，常为此饭量减少，夜间失眠，直接影响着他们的身心健康。
    如何满足这一部分同志的要求，使他们建设社会主义的满腔热情和全民建设社会主义的洪流汇在一起，更好地发扬他们革命的乐观主义精神，从而把他们变成一支鼓舞广大人民群众不断革命的政治力量。这是摆在我党组织面前的一项重大政治任务，也是做教养院工作者不可推卸的责任。
    我院党的总支委员会为了解决这个问题，曾采取了不少措施，而且不断向一切右倾保守思想进行了斗争。终于在整风运动中找到了办院的方向，这个方向，就是组织生产。但是，在组织生产过程中并不是一帆风顺的。开始对组织重残人员参加生产时，光在残废上打圈子，害怕组织生产，会影响他们的身心健康，对组织生产是否是办好教养院方向有怀疑。党组织为了教育党的干部，解除工休人员对组织生产的疑虑，便组织干部学习了无脚拖拉机手李来财和我院分散在农村的特等残废萧玉合、一等残废傅兰朝等劳动模范的事迹，深入宣传了北京市第一养老院和盲人福利协会组织的盲人训练班全面搞生产的经验，启发了全体人员搞生产的思想。他们说：“他们能搞生产，我们也能搞。”“李来财是双下肢截去的一等残废，傅兰朝是双目失明，他们在生产中能够成为劳动模范，为什么别的同志不能成为劳动模范呢？”为了从事实上再教育干部和全体人员，小型试验了养兔、养蚕、养蜂等生产。经过半年的实践，证明这些生产基本适合重残的条件，他们从生产中找到了愉快，感到生活得有意义了，体质也增强了。他们说：“参加生产不仅治好了神经衰弱病，也治好了思想病。”因而，他们的精神愉快，干劲十足。这样，初步奠定了搞生产的思想基础。同时参加生产者的顽强的意志，蓬勃的革命干劲，革命的乐观主义精神，冲破了一切习惯势力，也回击了那些保守主义者、观潮派，以及个别别有用心的坏分子的冷讽热嘲。说什么“兔司令，兔班长，穷积极，啥也搞不成，不信，等等看。”等流言蜚语。时间并不长，只有一年，二十只家兔发展到三百多只，两群蜜蜂发展到十六群，一头母猪发展到二十七头……特别是参加生产者每人预分了三百元的红利和许多同志学到了技术的事实，有力地驳斥了保守主义者，观潮派所谓“残废即废人”“教养院不能搞生产”的错误论调。大大激发了休养员参加生产的积极性，也进一步启发和坚定了我们大搞生产的决心。
    然而，这时参加生产的还是少数人，而且仅仅搞了一些小型的副业生产，至于能否大搞生产，能否工、农、副业大发展，能否吸收95％以上的重残者都能参加生产，还有顾虑。党总支根据全民大搞生产的形势结合中央关于干部参加体力劳动的指示精神，在相信群众大多数的指导思想下，以办院方向、大搞生产为内容，发动了鸣放高潮，在鸣放中休养员以大字报形式，纷纷要求参加生产，并提出“残而不废，大搞生产”和“坚决变消费单位为生产单位，变残废者为劳动者，以革命英雄气慨向生产建设进军！”等战斗行动口号。这时，党总支根据群众的要求制订了跃进生产规划，并发动了全党和全体人员写了决心书和保证书，于“五一”召开了全面转向生产的誓师大会，95％的成员都参加生产。从而一切促退论调也宣告破产。
    总之，组织重残人员参加生产，并不是没有困难的，问题在于不断向右倾保守思想斗争，相信群众的多数，依靠全党，充分发动群众，任何困难是可以克服的。在组织生产过程中，只要周密地组织生产上和体力上的协作，教养院不仅可以搞农业、副业和园艺生产，而且可以搞工业生产。
