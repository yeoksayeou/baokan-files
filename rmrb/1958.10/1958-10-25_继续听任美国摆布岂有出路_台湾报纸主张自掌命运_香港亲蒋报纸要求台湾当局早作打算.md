Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: A "National Evening News" editorial in Taiwan on the 20th called on the Taiwan authorities to take control of their own destiny. The editorial said, "Our destiny should be created by ourselves, and cannot be arranged by outsiders; our actions must come from our own choices and decisions, and not be led by the nose."
    A "Public Opinion Daily" editorial in Taiwan on the 21st, "Welcoming" Dulles, said that many "absolutely unfavorable" "statements, such as the so-called neutralization of Jinmen and Mazu, mutual renunciation of the use of force, holding a plebiscite, etc.," and Dulles's "reliable ceasefire" and opposition to "stationing heavy troops in Jinmen and Mazu" and other "grand pronouncements," "not only make us feel greatly confused," but also "lead to a considerable distance in viewpoints." Before this, "Public Opinion Daily" had already advised the Taiwan authorities to be wary of being "sacrificed" by others in the "international haze."
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 24th: Hong Kong news: Hong Kong newspapers related to Taiwan have recently been discussing US-Chiang relations.
    The Hong Kong "Wah Kiu Yat Po" editorial on the 20th called on the Taiwan authorities to adopt an independent and autonomous policy. This newspaper, which calls the Taiwan authorities "Free China," said in its editorial, "To understand the wishes of the military and civilians of Free China, they do not want any foreign forces to interfere in the Jinmen and Mazu issue. Free China's affairs are decided by itself, whether to make peace or war is decided by itself, life and death are also decided by itself. Free China will never allow any foreign country or foreigner to interfere in Free China's affairs, especially the affairs of Jinmen and Mazu." This newspaper advocated that the Taiwan authorities "must be vigilant, no matter what Dulles does, initiative is still in our own hands."
    The Hong Kong "Kung Sheung Daily News" editorial on the 19th said that "the issue of stationing troops in Jinmen and Mazu and counterattacking the mainland, etc.," are purely matters of the Taiwan authorities' "own sovereignty and cannot be said to be a disagreement between China (Chiang) and the US." The editorial said that just when the Taiwan authorities were "showing suspicion and surprise at US policy," Dulles's visit to Taiwan to discuss the "stationing of troops in Jinmen and Mazu and counterattacking the mainland" as "the theme of negotiation, we think is extremely terrible."
    This pro-Chiang newspaper expressed dissatisfaction with the US's conspiracy to create "two Chinas." It said that Dulles's visit to Taiwan this time "is to hold an opening ceremony for 'two Chinas'" and personally "axed" the friendship between the US and Chiang.
    A commentary in the Hong Kong "Natural Daily" on the 20th believed that "the US attitude is flickering," causing people to "arouse a kind of worry." Therefore, the Taiwan authorities should "be vigilant" to avoid being "sacrificed."
    This newspaper's commentary suggested that the Taiwan authorities "when sovereignty still belongs to us, we should not make any promises for future practices that will be controlled by others, whether material or spiritual." This newspaper said that the people of Taiwan "clearly see that the position of American compromisers is unreliable." What the Taiwan authorities "need to guard against today is foreign interference; our affairs are decided by ourselves." This newspaper also mentioned "how to deal with the coercion and enticement of Americans," saying that the Taiwan authorities "must not give in when dealing with the United States; a slight concession will make the situation even more difficult in the future."
    The Kuomintang's "Hong Kong Times" has recently published many commentaries, acknowledging that "there is indeed a difference of opinion" between the US and the Taiwan authorities, and "in recent years, Free China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group) has done its best to accommodate the US for the sake of the overall situation. However, this has a certain limit."
    The "Hong Kong Times" editorial on the 21st said that the US is now "being humble and submissive to the enemy, and bossy to its friends," and that Eisenhower's proposed "liberation policy" (referring to the US's subversion policy towards socialist countries) is just a "beautiful lie." The commentary said that if the US "limits the so-called 'security mutual assistance' goal to the small island of Taiwan, then we, out of concern for our own survival, will not need to be at anyone's beck and call."
    The newspaper said in an editorial on the 22nd that the US-Chiang military treaty "is no less than an iron chain added to us (referring to the Taiwan authorities)," and that this treaty is the Taiwan authorities' "self-imposed restriction" and "shackles." Therefore, it is hoped that the Taiwan authorities will take advantage of "Mr. Dulles's visit to Taiwan to thoroughly review this issue." "If the United States really has no intention of assisting us in recovering the mainland," then "whether this 'treaty' has any need to exist is also worth studying."
    The "Hong Kong Times" also mentioned the peace talk proposal, admitting that the Taiwan authorities "have more qualifications and reasons than the United States to conduct negotiations" on the Taiwan issue. However, it also said that the Taiwan authorities still refuse to negotiate because they want to "talk about principles and consider the consequences" to the United States.
    The Hong Kong "Universal Daily News" said on the 19th, "If the US government sacrifices the interests of its allies for the sake of the Republican Party's election, Taipei's suspicion of the United States will never disappear."
    The Hong Kong "Astronomical Observatory" bi-daily publication questioned the United States on the 20th, saying, "Originally, Jinmen and Mazu are territories of the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek group). By what right does the United States have to discuss negotiations related to Jinmen and Mazu with the CCP without the consent or authorization of the Republic of China?"
    This newspaper demanded that the Taiwan authorities adopt an attitude of "not allowing others to overstep their bounds" on the Jinmen and Mazu issue.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Hong Kong News: Hong Kong newspapers related to Taiwan continued to publish comments on the US-Chiang talks on the 23rd.
    The "Sing Tao Daily" editorial said that the Taiwan authorities' "patience with the United States is rarely seen in the world." And Chiang Kai-shek still "maintains the greatest tolerance for the United States." "As for breaking with Dulles, it is not so easy." The commentary said that the US-Chiang talks "for the United States, Dulles and others have gained something from this trip." For the Taiwan authorities, "it can only be said that they helped their allies once again." Therefore, "I hope that Dulles and others will not talk nonsense after returning to the United States."
    The "Wah Kiu Yat Po" editorial said that since the United States is an "ally" of the Taiwan authorities, it should provide support "politically and diplomatically." However, the United States has many "damaging measures" against the Taiwan authorities.
    The "Natural Daily" commentary said that for the Taiwan authorities, "undeniably, a shadow of 'betrayal' and 'appeasement' still looms over Washington." "So, to be honest, we cannot help but have some 'wariness' about the United States as such an 'ally'."

    继续听任美国摆布岂有出路
    台湾报纸主张自掌命运
    香港亲蒋报纸要求台湾当局早作打算
    新华社24日讯　台湾“民族晚报”20日的社论要求台湾当局自己掌握命运。社论说，
  “我们的命运应由我们自己创造，不能听由外人的安排；我们的行动必须出诸我们自己的选择决定，而不是被牵着鼻子走。”
    台湾“公论报”21日发表“欢迎”杜勒斯的社论说，许多“绝对不利”于台湾当局的
  “种种说法，如所谓金马中立化，相互放弃使用武力，举行公民投票等等”，以及杜勒斯
  “可靠的停火”和反对
  “驻重兵于金马”等“宏论”，都“不仅使我们感到莫大的困惑”，并且“导致了观点上有相当的距离”。在这以前，“公论报”已经劝告台湾当局要提防在
  “国际阴霾下”被别人
  “牺牲”。
    新华社广州24日电
  香港消息：与台湾方面有关的香港报纸，最近对美蒋关系议论纷纷。
    香港“华侨日报”在20日的社论中，要求台湾当局采取独立自主的政策。这家把台湾当局称为“自由中国”的报纸社论说，“要了解自由中国军民的意愿，是不希望任何外国势力干涉金门马祖问题的。自由中国的事由自己决定，为和为战自己决定，生生死死也要自己决定，自由中国决不容任何外国或外国人干涉自由中国的事，尤其是金门马祖的事”。这家报纸主张台湾当局“必须提高警惕，不管杜勒斯有何作为，主动仍然在我们自己”。
    香港“工商日报”19日的社论说，“金马驻军和反攻大陆等等问题”，都是纯属台湾当局“自己主权之事，根本说不上中（蒋）美间的异见。”社论说，正当台湾当局“对美国政策显露着怀疑惊异”的时候”，杜勒斯到台湾把“金马驻军和反攻大陆”这两个问题“作为谈商的主题，我们认为是十二分可怕的”。
    这家亲蒋帮的报纸对美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋表示不满。它说，杜勒斯这次到台湾“是为‘两个中国’举行开幕典礼”，并且亲手把美蒋的友谊来一次“斧削”。
    香港“自然日报”20日的评论认为“美国的态度闪烁”，使人“惹起一种忧虑”。因此，台湾当局要“提高警惕”以免被“牺牲利益”。
    这家报纸的评论建议台湾当局在“主权尚属我的时候，我们对于将来一切将受控制于人的做法，无论是物质的或精神的都不要有所承诺”。这家报纸说，台湾的人们“看清楚了美国妥协分子的立场不可靠”。台湾当局“今天所要提防的，便是外国的干涉，我们的事由我们自己决定”。这家报纸还提到“怎样来对付美国人的威迫利诱”，他说，台湾当局与美国打交道时“决不能让步，稍作让步，今后的处境势将更困难”。
    国民党的“香港时报”最近发表了许多评论，承认美国和台湾当局之间“存有歧见是事实”，而“这几年来，自由中国（指蒋介石集团）为了顾全大局，对美方已竭尽迁就能事。然而这自有一定限度”。
    21日的“香港时报”社论说，现在美国是“对敌人委曲求全，对朋友颐气指使”，而艾森豪威尔所提出的“解放政策”（指美国对社会主义国家的颠复政策）只是属于“美丽的谎言”。评论说，如果美国“将所谓‘安全互助’的目标，只限于台湾弹丸之地，那我们怵于自身生存的利害关系，也就没有俯仰由人的必要”。
    这家报纸在22日的社论中说，美蒋军事条约“不啻是加在我们（指台湾当局）身上的一条铁链”，这个条约是台湾当局“作茧自缚”和“束缚手足”，因此，希望台湾当局乘“杜勒斯先生访问台湾的时机，把这项问题彻底检讨一番”。“假使美国真是没有协助我们光复大陆的意念”，那么这项“条约”“究竟有无存在的必要，亦就大可研究”。
    “香港时报”还提到和谈建议，它承认对于台湾问题，台湾当局“较美国尤有进行谈判的资格和理由”。但是，它又说，台湾当局因为要对美国“讲原则，顾后果”，故依然拒绝和谈。
    香港“环球报”19日说，“如美国政府为了共和党的竞选，不惜牺牲盟邦的利益，台北对美国的疑惧将始终无法消失。”
    香港“天文台”双日刊在20日质问美国说，“本来金马是中华民国（指蒋介石集团）领土，美国何权何位，可以不经中华民国之同意或委托，而与中共商讨有关金马之谈判？”
    这家报纸要求台湾当局对金马问题采取“不允许他人越俎代庖”的态度。
    新华社24日讯　香港消息：与台湾方面有关的香港报纸23日继续就美蒋会谈发表评论。
    “星岛日报”的社论说，台湾当局“对美国之相忍，是世上难逢的”。而蒋介石到现在“仍然对美国保持最大的容忍”，“至于与杜勒斯决裂，更不是这么容易”。评论说，美蒋会谈“对美国来说，杜勒斯等此行已有收获。”而对台湾当局来说，“只可以说又帮了盟友一次忙”。因此，“但愿杜勒斯等回美以后，不要乱说话”。
    “华侨日报”的社论说，美国既与台湾当局为“盟友”，那么“在政治与外交上”，就应加以支持。可是美国却有不少对台湾当局的“损害措施”。
    “自然日报”的评论说，对台湾当局来说，“无可否认的，一种‘出卖’和‘姑息’阴影，仍笼罩着华盛顿”。“所以，老实说来，我们对于美国这么一个‘盟友’，总不免是有多少‘戒心’的。”
