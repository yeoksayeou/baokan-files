Inner Mongolia's Astonishing Transformation
	Not a single jin of iron or steel produced last year, but 800 tons of molten iron flowing out in a single day this year.

(Our dispatch) Just last year, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region didn't produce even a jin of iron or steel. But on September 26th of this year, it produced 831 tons of high-quality pig iron and 32.4 tons of steel. This is a war achievement attained by the 9 million Mongolian, Hui, Han, Korean, and Daur people and other ethnic groups of Inner Mongolia.

	Just after midnight on the 28th, the iron and steel smelting furnaces in the vast cities, towns, rural areas, pastoral areas, and forest areas of Inner Mongolia were already burning fiercely.

	In Baotou City, more than 100,000 people participated in iron and steel production on the 29th, operating more than 600 iron smelting furnaces. The 80-cubic-meter small blast furnace of Little Baogang, which had just been put into production for half a month, produced 98 tons of iron that day.

    28日午夜刚刚过去，内蒙古广大城镇、农村、牧区和林区的炼铁炼钢炉，就已燃起了熊熊烈火。
    在包头市，29日参加钢铁生产的大军达十万多人，开动炼铁炉六百多座。小包钢投入生产刚半月的八十立方公尺小高炉，这天出铁九十八吨。
