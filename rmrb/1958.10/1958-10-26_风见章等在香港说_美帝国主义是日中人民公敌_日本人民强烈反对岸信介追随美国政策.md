Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, October 25th. Kazami Akira, head of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Delegation to China, and Hirano Yoshitaro, deputy head of the Japan-China Friendship Association Delegation to China, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday after completing their visit to China. When meeting with reporters in Hong Kong, they both unanimously pointed out that American imperialism is the common enemy of the Japanese and Chinese people. In order to defend world peace and common interests, the people of the two countries must stand together and fight together.

	Kazami Akira said that the United States' aggressive actions against China have actually undermined peace in Asia. This action has aroused opposition from people and public opinion in various countries. Therefore, the United States' war policy is bound to fail. He emphasized that the United States will have to withdraw its troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait sooner or later. Its only way out is "the best of the Thirty-Six Stratagems is to leave."

	Kazami Akira believes that Kishi Nobusuke's remarks to American reporters on October 14 have created a serious situation in Japan. Kishi Nobusuke openly advocated revising the clauses in the Japanese Constitution that prohibit war, and slandered China as an "aggressor," echoing the United States' war cries. Kishi Nobusuke wants to push the Japanese people onto the road of war. Kazami Akira pointed out, however, that Kishi Nobusuke's actions have aroused strong opposition from the Japanese people and public opinion.

	Speaking of the "Amendment to the Police Officer Duties Execution Law" recently submitted to the Diet by the Kishi Nobusuke government, Kazami Akira said: This practice shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government is precisely a pawn of American imperialists, and now the Japanese people are taking opposition to this "amendment" as the goal of their struggle.

	Hirano Yoshitaro believes that Dulles's talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique this time are another clear evidence of the United States' attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan. He said that the "unity" emphasized in their joint communiqué is only to illustrate that the contradictions between them are even more acute. He pointed out that the United States' boast of using Taiwan as a base to "protect" the interests of the so-called "free world" is essentially aggression, and its result will inevitably be failure.

	Hosokawa Kakuroku, deputy head of the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations Delegation to China, severely condemned the United States' aggressive acts of military provocation in the Taiwan Strait region. He told reporters that the order issued by Chinese Defense Minister Peng Dehuai to resume shelling Jinmen was reasonable and justified. China has morally overwhelmed the United States, and the people of Asia are standing on China's side.

    风见章等在香港说
    美帝国主义是日中人民公敌
    日本人民强烈反对岸信介追随美国政策
    新华社香港25日电　日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团团长风见章和日中友好协会访华代表团副团长平野义太郎结束了在中国的访问后昨天到达香港。他们在接见香港的记者时，都一致指出，美帝国主义是日本人民和中国人民的共同敌人。为了保卫世界和平和共同利益，两国人民要站在一起共同进行斗争。
    风见章说，美国对中国的侵略行为，实际上破坏了亚洲的和平，这种行动引起了各国人士和舆论的反对，因此，美国的战争政策必告失败。他强调指出，美国迟早不能不把军队撤出台湾和台湾海峡。它的唯一出路就是“三十六计，走为上计”。
    风见章认为岸信介10月14日对美国记者发表的谈话已使日本产生了严重的局面。岸信介公然主张修改日本的宪法中关于禁止战争的条款、并且诬蔑中国为“侵略者”跟随美国叫嚣战争。岸信介要把日本人民推到战争的道路上去。风见章指出，但是，岸信介这种做法已引起了日本人民和舆论的强烈反对。
    谈到岸信介政府最近向国会提出的“警察官职务执行法修正案”时，风见章说：这种做法表示了岸信介政府正是美帝国主义者的走卒，现在日本人民把反对这个“修正案”作为斗争的目标。
    平野义太郎认为，杜勒斯这次同蒋介石集团举行会谈是美国企图永远霸占台湾的又一明证。他说，他们这次会谈公报所强调的“团结”只不过是说明他们之间的矛盾更加尖锐罢了。他指出，美国吹嘘以台湾为据点来“保护”所谓“自由世界”的利益的谰调实质上就是侵略，其结果必然是失败。
    日本恢复日中邦交国民会议访华代表团副团长细川嘉六严厉斥责了美国在台湾海峡地区进行军事挑衅的侵略行为。他对记者说，中国国防部彭德怀部长发布的恢复炮击金门的命令是合情合理的。中国在道义上压倒了美国，亚洲人民都站在中国这一边。
