Emphasize Politics, Not Money
    A Batch of Factories in Xi'an and Lüda Discard Piece-Rate Wage System for a Light-March Great Leap Forward
    (According to Xi'an Daily) Workers of the Xi'an State-owned Qing'an Machinery Factory, Xi'an Machinery Factory, Factory 601, and Sanqiao Vehicle Repair Factory in Xi'an City, on the basis of increased communist consciousness, voluntarily requested the leadership to abolish the piece-rate wage system.
    Before abolishing the piece-rate wage system, the workers in these factories conducted debates. The workers believed that the piece-rate wage system had many shortcomings, seriously hindering the workers' rising communist ideology and the Great Leap Forward in production. Many workers at the Qing'an Machinery Factory said: We are actively producing to accelerate socialist construction, realize communism at an early date, and make the people and future generations live a happy life, not for a few bucks. Workers in the forging workshop of the Sanqiao Vehicle Factory said in the debate: The piece-rate wage system seriously restricts our pace of a light-march Great Leap Forward and suppresses the development of mass wisdom. Some workers asked in their speeches: "Is our Great Leap Forward in production for money? If so, what kind of Great Leap Forward is that?" Therefore, they posted big-character posters asking the leadership to approve the abolition of the piece-rate wage system and put forward their own new measures for the leap forward.
    The abolition of the piece-rate wage system in the aforementioned factories has powerfully promoted the leap forward in production. To complete the September plan, the workers of the Qing'an Machinery Factory were full of energy and in a good mood, broke the eight-hour working day, and consciously worked twelve hours a day, and constantly innovated technology. In more than twenty days, every worker in the ironworking section realized innovation proposals that improved work efficiency by one to three times. The wheel six work area of the Sanqiao Vehicle Factory had not been able to complete the production plan well when the piece-rate wage system was implemented; after the piece-rate wage system was stopped, politics took command, and their thinking was liberated. They automatically proposed to change the three shifts to two shifts and draw out one shift to support other units. The worker Xu Diange said well: "In the past, when piece-rate was implemented, the Renminbi urged production, but now politics takes command and we work consciously." The Niu Bingkun group in the forging workshop of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory jumped from making a maximum of 17 wire tighteners per person to 26, and the production of screw caps jumped from the quota of 240 under the piece-rate system to 420. After the abolition of the piece-rate wage in the factories, the unity among the workers was also strengthened.
    (According to Lüda Daily) Communist ideology shines brightly among the workers of the Lüda Aquatic Products Repair and Shipbuilding Factory, and the workers consciously abolished the piece-rate wage system.
    The workers in the repair and shipbuilding workshop of this factory were the first to propose the abolition of the piece-rate wage system. In the debate on for whom we were working in April of this year, especially after the Great Leap Forward in production, the piece-rate wage system had become an obstacle to the leap forward, and the workers successively proposed the abolition of the piece-rate wage system. The workshop party organization conducted investigations and studies based on the suggestions put forward by the workers. Many specific facts proved that the piece-rate wage system did restrict the further development of the productive forces. For example, the piece-rate wage system excessively emphasized the role of material incentives, weakened political leadership, fostered the economism of the workers, and increased the internal contradictions among the workers. The piece-rate wage system also had contradictions with the rational allocation of labor. Based on the above situation, the workshop party organization further organized workers to hold forums, engage in extensive airing of views, big debates. Many workers said: "The piece-rate wage system is not politics taking command, but the Renminbi taking command, which is not good for the workers themselves or the country." After being approved by the factory leadership, they abolished the piece-rate wage system from April of this year and implemented the time-rate wage system. Soon, the factory promoted this experience and abolished the piece-rate wage system completely, and implemented the time-rate wage system.
    After the implementation of the time-rate wage system, production efficiency has greatly improved. During the period from January to March this year when the piece-rate wage system was implemented, the workers in the repair and shipbuilding workshop completed an average of 110.2% of the planned man-hours per month; after the piece-rate wage system was abolished, they completed an average of 137.5% of the planned man-hours per month from April to August, and the output of individual products exceeded the output during the piece-rate period by more than one time. In September, the factory abolished the piece-rate wage system, and the leap forward plan was completed by 153.2%.

### 要政治挂帅　不要钞票挂帅  西安旅大一批工厂抛掉计件工资制轻装大跃进

    要政治挂帅　不要钞票挂帅
    西安旅大一批工厂抛掉计件工资制轻装大跃进
    据西安日报报道　西安市国营庆安机器厂、西安机械厂、六○一厂和三桥车辆修理工厂职工，在共产主义觉悟提高的基础上，自动要求领导取消了计件工资制。
    这些工厂在取消计件工资制以前，职工们都进行了辩论。职工们认为，计件工资制缺点很多，严重地妨碍着工人共产主义思想的高涨和生产大跃进。庆安机器厂许多工人说：我们积极生产是为了加速社会主义建设，早日实现共产主义，使人民群众以及子孙万代过幸福生活，并不是为了几个钱。三桥车辆厂锻冶车间工人在辩论中说：计件工资制严重束缚了我们轻装大跃进的步伐，压抑了群众智慧的发挥。有的工人在发言中问道：“难道我们的生产大跃进是为了钞票吗？要是这样还算什么大跃进？”因此，他们纷纷张贴大字报，要求领导批准取消计件工资制，并提出自己跃进的新措施。
    上述工厂取消计件工资制以后，有力地推动了生产跃进。庆安机器厂职工为完成9月份计划，干劲冲天，心情舒畅，打破了八小时工作制，自觉地每天干十二个小时，并且不断革新技术。在二十多天中，铁工段每个工人都实现了提高工效一至三倍的革新建议。三桥车辆厂车轮六工区，原来实行计件工资制时，生产计划一直完成得不好；停止实行计件工资以后，政治挂了帅，思想获解放，他们自动提出将三班改成两班，抽出一班支援其他单位。工人徐殿阁说得好：“过去实行计件，是人民币督促生产，现在是政治挂帅，自觉地劳动。”西安农械厂锻压车间牛秉坤小组做紧线钳由原来每人最多做十七个，一跃而为二十六个，做螺丝帽由计件时的定额二百四十个，跃进到四百二十个。各厂在取消计件工资后，工人之间的团结也加强了。
    据旅大日报报道　共产主义思想在旅大水产修造船厂职工中大放光芒，职工们自觉地取消了计件工资制。
    这个厂修造船车间的职工最先提出取消计件工资制。在今年4月为谁劳动的辩论中，特别是生产大跃进以后，计件工资制已成为跃进的阻力，职工们纷纷提出取消计件工资制。车间党组织根据职工们提出的建议，进行了调查研究。许多具体事实证明计件工资制确实束缚了生产力的进一步发展。如计件工资制过分强调物质鼓励作用，削弱了政治挂帅，助长了工人群众的经济主义思想，增加了工人之间的内部矛盾。计件工资制与劳动力合理调配也有矛盾。根据上述情况，车间党组织又进一步组织工人座谈、大鸣、大放、大辩论。许多工人说：“计件工资制不是政治挂帅，而是人民币挂帅，这对工人自己和国家都没有好处。”经过工厂领导批准后，他们从今年4月份便取消了计件工资制，实行了计时工资制。不久，全厂推行了这一经验，全部取消了计件工资制，实行计时工资制。
    实行计时工资制以后，生产效率大大提高。修造船车间工人今年1月到3月份实行计件工资制期间，每月平均完成计划工时110.2％；取消计件工资制后，4月到8月每月平均完成计划工时137.5％，个别产品超过计件时期的产量一倍多。9月份全厂取消了计件工资制，跃进计划完成了153.2％。
