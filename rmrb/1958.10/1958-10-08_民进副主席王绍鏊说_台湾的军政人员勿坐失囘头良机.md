Xinhua News Agency, 7th - R.C.A. Vice Chairman Wang Shao'ao issued a statement regarding Minister Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwanese compatriots, saying: We fully support Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai's letter to Taiwanese compatriots. This proclamation fully expresses the deep concern and wishes of our mainland compatriots for the military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu islands.

	The current situation is very clear. Internationally, the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind. Domestically, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our motherland is developing rapidly, and the cause of socialist construction is flourishing. The military and civilians of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are all Chinese. They should, in the spirit of patriotism and family unity, quickly respond to Minister Peng Dehuai's call, accept the suggestion of holding negotiations, achieve a peaceful resolution, and enable compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible to jointly build a prosperous and strong new China. The Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must realize that the Americans will abandon you one day. American imperialism is our common enemy. Today, it is in unprecedented isolation internationally. Our guns should be aimed at the outside world, driving away the American robbers. Now is a good opportunity for you to turn back, do not miss it!

    民进副主席王绍鏊说
    台湾的军政人员勿坐失囘头良机
    新华社7日讯　中国民主促进会副主席王绍鏊就彭德怀部长告台湾同胞书发表谈话说：我们完全拥护国防部彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书。这一文告充分表达了我们大陆同胞对台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖等各岛军民同胞的深切关怀和愿望。
    目前形势非常清楚。在国际方面，东风继续压倒西风。在国内方面，我们祖国在中国共产党正确领导之下，正在飞跃发展，社会主义的建设事业如日方升。台、澎、金、马军民同胞都是中国人，应当本着爱国一家的精神，迅速响应彭德怀部长的号召，接受举行谈判的建议，实现和平解决，使同胞们早日回到祖国怀抱，共同建设繁荣富强的新中国。台、澎、金、马的国民党军政人员必须认识，美国人总有一天要抛弃你们的。美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。今日它在国际上已陷于空前孤立。我们的枪口应该一致对外，赶走美国强盗。现在正是你们回头的良机，不要坐失！
