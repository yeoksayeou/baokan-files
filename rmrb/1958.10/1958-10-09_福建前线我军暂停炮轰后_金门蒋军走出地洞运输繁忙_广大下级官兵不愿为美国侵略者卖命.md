Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 8th - Our frontline reporter reports: The People's Liberation Army troops on the Fujian Front have strictly implemented the order of Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai, and have temporarily suspended the shelling of Kinmen and other islands since the 6th. For nearly a month, no Chiang military warships dared to approach the Liaoluo Bay of Kinmen Island. In the past three days, more than a dozen transport ships and escort ships have approached the pier every day, transporting large amounts of materials to the island. Chiang's officers and soldiers, who had been hiding in bunkers for more than a month, are now coming out to rush to transport supplies. At night, these islands, which were originally pitch black, can now see twinkling lights.

　　In the past three days, the reporter has clearly seen the activities of Chiang's troops on the sea and land of Kinmen Island from the observation mirrors of our army's frontline positions. On the morning of the 8th, two "Zhong"-class and "Mei"-class landing ships, fully loaded with supplies, approached the Liaoluo Bay pier of Kinmen Island, safely berthed next to the American-made Chiang military warships sunk by our army. Prior to this, on the 6th, more than a dozen Chiang military transport ships, oil tankers, and warships sailed from Taiwan, Penghu, and other places to Kinmen Island. These transport ships initially timidly stopped in the waters far from Kinmen Island. Since our army's position did not fire a single shot, they approached Liaoluo Bay again at noon. On the 7th, a wooden-hulled motorboat loaded with military supplies sailed from Little Kinmen to Dadan Island. Our army reconnaissance personnel said, "This kind of slowpoke, like an old water buffalo, has never dared to move in the sea controlled by our army's artillery fire."

　　For three days, the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front has not fired a single shot. On the long coastal defense line, countless mighty cannons of our army stand tall and silent, and the artillery soldiers vigilantly guard their positions. Some are reading newspapers and learning culture, while others are wiping cannons and sorting ammunition. Our army's frontline broadcasting stations are constantly broadcasting Minister Peng Dehuai's "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" to the Chiang military officers and soldiers on Kinmen and other islands from morning to night.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th - The morale of the Chiang military entrenched on Kinmen Island is declining, and their lives are extremely difficult. The broad masses of lower-ranking officers and soldiers are longing for the mainland and eagerly hoping for early peace talks.

　　A United Press International reporter reported from Kinmen on the 6th that when the news that the People's Liberation Army's Fujian Front troops had temporarily suspended the shelling of Kinmen for seven days reached Kinmen, Chiang's soldiers emerging from the dirty bunkers "waved" to each other "and shouted 'Good!'". They are unwilling to risk their lives for the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. They say that if they stay on Kinmen, they will either be killed or starve to death.

　　According to news from Kinmen, the Chiang military's lower-ranking officers and soldiers call their life trapped on the isolated island of Kinmen "living hell." Due to insufficient supplies, the Kinmen Chiang military is approaching a state of running out of ammunition and food. Many soldiers suffer from stomach problems, night blindness, or anemia due to malnutrition and insufficient drinks. Among the Kinmen Chiang military, complaints are rampant, such as "Americans come up with ideas, Chiang Kai-shek gives orders, and the soldiers suffer and are tortured." Kinmen newspapers revealed that the current mentality of the Kinmen Chiang military is: "Depression, melancholy,颓丧, pessimism, and homesickness."

    福建前线我军暂停炮轰后
    金门蒋军走出地洞运输繁忙
    广大下级官兵不愿为美国侵略者卖命
    据新华社福建前线8日电　本社前线记者报道：福建前线人民解放军部队严格执行国防部长彭德怀元帅的命令，从6日起暂时停止了对金门等岛的炮击。近一个月来没有敢靠近金门岛料罗湾的蒋军军舰，最近三天来每天都有十几艘运输舰艇和护航舰靠拢码头，把大量的物资运到岛上。躲在地洞里一个多月的蒋军官兵，现在都走出来抢运物资。夜晚，这些原来一片漆黑的岛屿，如今又能看到点点灯光了。
    记者近三天来从我军前沿阵地的观察镜里，清晰地看到金门岛海面和地面蒋军活动的情况。8日早晨，有两艘满载物资的“中”字号和“美”字号登陆舰向金门岛料罗湾码头靠拢，它们安全地停泊在被我击沉的美制蒋军军舰两旁。在此以前，6日，已有十几艘蒋军运输舰、油轮和战斗舰，从台湾、澎湖等地驶往金门岛。这些运输舰、船开始还胆怯地停在金门岛很远的海面，由于我军阵地没有发出半点炮声，中午，它们又向料罗湾靠拢。7日，有一只木壳马达船装满军用物资从小金门往大担岛开去。我军侦察员说：“这样慢得像老水牛一样的家伙，过去从来也不敢在我军炮火控制的海面上行动。”
    三天来，福建前线我军一炮未发。在漫长的海防线上，我军无数门威武的大炮昂首静立，炮兵战士们警惕地守卫在阵地上。他们有的在阅读报纸，学习文化，有的擦洗火炮，整理弹药。我军的各个前线广播站，从早到晚不断地向金门等岛的蒋军官兵播送彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书。
    新华社8日讯　盘踞在金门岛上的蒋军士气日益低落，生活困苦不堪，广大下级官兵心向大陆，渴望早日和平谈判。
    合众国际社记者6日从金门发出的消息说，当中国人民解放军福建前线部队暂以七天为期停止炮击金门的消息传到金门以后，从肮脏的地堡里走出来的蒋军士兵都互相“招手”，“并且高声叫‘好’”。他们不愿为美国侵略者和蒋介石集团卖命，他们说，再在金门呆下去，不被打死，也得饿死。
    据来自金门方面的消息说，蒋军下级官兵把他们困守金门孤岛的生活称作“活受罪”。由于供应不足，金门蒋军已接近弹尽粮绝的困境。许多士兵因营养不良和饮料不足，患胃病、夜盲症或贫血症。在金门蒋军中，“美国人出点子，蒋介石下命令，当兵的卖命受苦刑”等怨言蜂起。金门报纸透露，现在金门蒋军的心理是：“苦闷、悒郁，颓丧、悲观、思家”。
