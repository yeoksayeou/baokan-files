    Sweep the Frost from Another's Roof
    Chen Tao
    When the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant was rushing to complete its monthly plan, it transferred some important components of a steam turbine generator that was being assembled to Hangzhou to support a major technological reform jointly undertaken by the Zhejiang Electric Machinery Plant and Zhejiang University, meeting their urgent needs. Some people couldn't understand this, and the factory director said, "Give it to whoever is more important."
    "Give it to whoever is more important" is a manifestation of communist style, and this sentence is thought-provoking. From this, we can see the fundamental difference between individualism, departmentalism, and collectivism. Individualists and departmentalists always regard their own work, their own unit, and everything about themselves as particularly important, while other departments and other work seem insignificant to them. They place themselves outside the collective, only seeing the area right in front of them. When others ask for support or cooperation, they always find various reasons to refuse, truly being tightfisted. Their approach is precisely what our Chinese saying describes: "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on another's roof." Collectivists are not like this. They have a correct assessment of their own department and their own work, neither belittling nor exaggerating it, and place themselves within the collective, as an indivisible part of the collective. Therefore, they have broad minds and far-sighted vision, and when dealing with problems, they can weigh the importance and give priority to the needs of the collective cause. They not only sweep the snow from their own doorstep, but also sweep the frost from another's roof.
    The Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant was rushing to complete its monthly plan, which cannot be said to be unimportant, but they considered that if the Zhejiang Electric Machinery Plant and Zhejiang University lacked those components, it would affect the progress of the technological reform – and this technological reform, which could increase the power generation of generators, is of great significance nationwide. Therefore, they decisively made this decision. This is something that departmentalists cannot recognize and are unwilling to do.
    The collectivist spirit of "One for all, all for one" is flourishing everywhere. The countryside supports the cities, the cities support the countryside, one department supports another, one region supports another, cooperating with each other and helping each other, all sweeping the frost from another's roof. There are countless touching examples. Let's look at another example:
    "Competitors are opponents, but even more so, they are close brothers" – this is the noble quality displayed by the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard in its competition with the Dalian Shipyard to see who could build a 5,000-ton ocean-going vessel faster. Some parts of the Dalian Shipyard's vessel were manufactured by the Jiangnan Shipyard. During the manufacturing process, the Jiangnan Shipyard always made the components for the other party first, and then made them for themselves. When some parts could not be rushed out in time, they even removed them from other ships to supply the Dalian Shipyard.
    Why did the Jiangnan Shipyard do that? Were they not afraid of not winning the red flag of excellence? This is also something that departmentalists cannot understand. But the workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard realized that whether it is the Dalian Shipyard or the Jiangnan Shipyard, they are all part of our national enterprises and are the property of the people themselves. There is no distinction between "them" and "us." The purpose of the competition is to increase production. Increased production means making contributions to the country and benefiting the people. Winning the red flag of excellence is certainly glorious; but achieving mutual assistance, common improvement, and a large increase in production is an even greater honor. Therefore, they can regard "opponents" as "close brothers," not only sweeping the snow from their own doorstep, but also sweeping the frost from another's roof, and doing so by first sweeping the frost from another's roof, and then sweeping the snow from their own doorstep.

    要扫他人瓦上霜
    陈涛
    上海电机厂在赶着完成月度计划的时候，为了支援浙江电机厂和浙江大学合搞的一项重大技术改革，把正在装配的一台汽轮发电机的一些重要部件调往杭州，满足他们的火急需要。有人思想不通，厂长说：“谁重要就给谁。”
    “谁重要就给谁”，这是共产主义风格的表现，这句话也引人深思。从这里可以看出个人主义、本位主义和集体主义的根本区别，个人主义者、本位主义者总把自己的工作，自己的单位，自己的一切一切看得特别重要，而别的部门，别的工作，在他们看来似乎都是无足轻重的。他们把自己置身于集体之外，只看到自己眼下一块地方，别人要求支援，要求协作，他们总要找出种种理由加以拒绝，真是铁公鸡一毛不拔。他们的这种做法正应了我国的一句俗话：“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”。集体主义者就不是这样，他们对自己的部门，自己的工作有正确的估计，既不轻视，也不夸大，把自己放在集体之中，作为集体不可分割的一部分。因此，他们心胸开阔，目光远大，在处理问题时就能权衡轻重，首先是服从集体事业的需要。不但要自管门前雪，而且要扫他人瓦上霜。
    上海电机厂赶着完成月度计划，这不能说不重要，但是他们考虑到浙江电机厂和浙江大学如果缺少那些部件，就要影响技术改革的进展——而这项可以使发电机提高发电力的技术改革，在全国说来都是有重大意义的，因此他们断然作了这个决定。这是本位主义者认识不到，而且也不愿意这样做的。
    “我为人人，人人为我”的集体主义精神正在到处昂扬，农村支援城市，城市支援农村，这一部门支援那一部门，这一地区支援那一地区，彼此协作，互相帮助，都要大扫他人瓦上霜，动人的事例，真是不胜枚举。再看这个例子：
    “竞赛是对手，更是亲密的兄弟”——这是上海江南造船厂在同大连造船厂开展五千吨海轮谁造得快的竞赛中表现出来的高贵品质。大连厂的海轮有一部分部件是由江南厂制造的，在制造中，江南厂总是先替对方做好协作的部件，然后再给自己做。有的部件来不及赶制，他们甚至从别的船上拆下供给大连厂。
    江南造船厂为什么那样做？他们不怕优胜红旗拿不到么？这也是本位主义者所不能理解的。但是江南造船厂的职工们认识到，不管大连造船厂还是江南造船厂，都是我们国家企业的一部分，都是人民自己的财产，并没有“他”和“我”之分。竞赛的目的是为了增加生产，生产增加了，就是为国家立功，为人民造福。拿到优胜红旗固然光彩；而做到互相帮助，共同提高，大量增加生产，那就是更大的荣誉。因此他们才能把“对手”看为“亲密的兄弟”，不仅要扫自己门前雪，还要大扫他人瓦上霜，而且做到先扫他人瓦上霜，再扫自己门前雪。
