Xinhua News Agency, 3rd October – The nation's million coal mine workers continued production as usual during the October 1st and 2nd National Day holidays, to ensure the "Marshal of Steel" has plenty to eat. In these two days, they increased the nation's coal production by a total of 1.5 million tons. More than 60% of this was coking coal for the iron and steel industry.

National coal mine production in September increased by 28.2% compared to August, but because steel production increased even faster, the supply of coking coal was still insufficient. Therefore, workers at various mines fully demonstrated the spirit of communist cooperation, and on the eve of National Day, they requested to give up their holidays and work overtime to produce coal to meet the needs of increased steel production. Workers at the Datong Mining Bureau also put forward the slogan "A year of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." They continued production as usual during the holidays and did not want the overtime pay stipulated by the state.

On the 1st and 2nd, the attendance rate at some coal mines was also higher than usual. For example, the attendance rate at the Huainan Coal Mine reached 100% on the 1st; the attendance rates at the Datong and Fushun Coal Mines increased by 2% to 10% compared to September. Although it was raining heavily in the northeastern part of the Northeast on the 1st and 2nd, workers at the Hegang Open-pit Mine still persisted in production wearing raincoats.

During these two days, party secretaries, bureau chiefs, mine managers, and others from various mines personally went down the mine shafts to work alongside the workers, and promptly solved many key problems in production. Therefore, although some coal mines were affected by power outages and certain mechanical repairs, the production level of most coal mines was higher than the average daily production level in September. The Fengfeng Coal Mine, which is rich in coking coal, produced 22,084 tons of raw coal on the 1st, an increase of more than 17% compared to the average daily output in September. The Jiangxi Dongjiashan Coal Mine usually has a daily output of only 100 tons, but on October 1st it reached 428 tons, an increase of more than three times compared to usual.

### 全国百万矿工节日献厚礼  两天挖煤150万吨

    全国百万矿工节日献厚礼
    两天挖煤150万吨
    新华社3日讯　全国百万煤矿职工为了让钢铁元帅饱食美餐，在10月1日和2日国庆节例假期间照常生产。在这两天内，他们共计为国家增产了一百五十万吨煤炭。其中有60％以上是供钢铁工业用的炼焦煤。
    全国煤矿9月份的产量比8月份提高了28.2％，但是由于钢铁生产增长得更快，炼焦煤的供应仍感不足。因此，各矿职工充分发扬了共产主义协作精神，在国庆前夕纷纷提出要求放弃休假，加班生产煤炭来满足钢铁增产的需要。大同矿务局的职工还提出了“一年辛苦、万年幸福”的口号，他们在假期内照常生产，而且不要国家规定的加班工资。
    在1日和2日，有的煤矿的出勤率也比平时高。如淮南煤矿1日的出勤率达到了100％；大同和抚顺煤矿的出勤率比9月份提高了2％到10％。东北北部地区在1、2日虽然下着滂沱大雨，但是鹤岗露天矿的职工穿着雨衣仍然坚持生产。
    在这两天内，各矿的党委书记、局长、矿长等都亲自下井同工人一起劳动，并且及时解决了生产中的许多关键问题。因此，虽有一部分煤矿因为受停电和某些机械检修的影响，但是大部分煤矿的生产水平都高于9月份的平均日产水平。盛产炼焦煤的峰峰煤矿在1日就生产了二万二千零八十四吨原煤，比9月份平均日产量提高了17％以上。江西董家山煤矿平常日产量不过一百吨，10月1日达到了四百二十八吨，比平时增产了三倍还多。
