Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou. The largest railway and highway bridge in South China, spanning the north and south banks of the Pearl River and connecting the Beijing-Guangzhou and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways, officially began construction on the 19th.

The bridge is 735 meters long, three times longer than the existing Haizhu Bridge in Guangzhou. It is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The center of the bridge is a double-track railway, with a 4.5-meter-wide asphalt road on each side of the railway, and a 1.5-meter-wide sidewalk on each side of the road.

After the completion of this bridge, one can take a train directly to Beijing from Sanshui County, Guangdong; the highway in Guangzhou can also be connected with the highways in this province, the southwest region, and Guangxi. (Attached picture)

The Zhujiang Bridge has begun full-scale construction. This is the use of a floating crane for construction to reinforce the old piers. The old piers were built by the Kuomintang in three years and nine months before liberation. The caissons were not even sunk to the specified elevation, and they were tilting in all directions.

    珠江大桥动工兴建
    据新华社广州电　横跨珠江南北，连接京广、广三铁路的华南最大一座铁路、公路两用桥，已在19日正式动工兴建。
    这座大桥全长七百三十五公尺，比广州市现有的海珠桥长三倍。预计在明年底建成。大桥中央是双轨铁路，铁路两侧各有一条宽四、五公尺的柏油公路，公路两侧各为宽一·五公尺的人行道。
    这座大桥建成后，由广东三水县坐上火车就可以直达北京；广州的公路也可以与本省、西南地区及广西等地区的公路连接起来。（附图片）
    珠江大桥开始全面施工。这是采用吊船施工，加固旧墩。旧墩是解放前国民党花了三年零九个月才修成的。连沉井都没有沉到标高，就东倒西歪了。　　新华社记者　蔡忠植摄
