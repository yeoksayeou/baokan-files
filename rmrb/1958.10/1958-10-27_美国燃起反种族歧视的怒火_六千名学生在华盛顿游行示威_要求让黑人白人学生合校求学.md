Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Washington Dispatch - With the enthusiastic support of broad sections of society across the United States, six thousand students held a march and demonstration in the capital, Washington, yesterday, opposing racial discrimination and demanding integrated schools for Black and White students. This is the largest demonstration in recent years on the front lines of the American people's struggle for racial equality: "Youth March for Integrated Schools."

After thorough preparations, six thousand students arrived in Washington on the 25th from Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. Among them were both Black and White students, Christian and Catholic. They are representatives of the broad masses of American youth and students, most of whom traveled to Washington in buses chartered for them by labor unions and religious organizations in major cities.

The marching column moved mightily through the streets of Washington. The placards they carried read: "Segregation Insults Human Dignity," "End Racial Hatred, Implement Integrated Schools."

A delegation sent by the marching column had requested a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower the day before the march, but was refused. On the day of the march, the delegation went to the White House again to find Eisenhower, but was blocked by the White House guards, who told them that Eisenhower had gone golfing.

Eisenhower's attitude of ignoring Black rights aroused great indignation among the delegation. A statement left for Eisenhower by the delegation pointed out that the American South is now being ruled by racists, where there is terrible persecution of Blacks. The statement demanded the trial of criminal racists and the effective protection of the constitutional and moral rights of all children in school.

The marching masses held a mass rally in front of the Lincoln Memorial, attended by about ten thousand people. Former famous American Black baseball star Robinson pointed out at the rally that this demonstration was to show the world that "the American people are opposed to racial discrimination, and Little Rock is not America." Black celebrity singer Belafonte said that Eisenhower, by not receiving the delegation of marchers, had made a thought-provoking gesture to hundreds of millions of people around the world.

Organizing and leading this demonstration were Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the central organization of the American Black movement; Black pastor Martin Luther King Jr., who had led the Black people in Montgomery in opposition to racial segregation on buses; and others, who formed the "Youth March for Integrated Schools" organization.

    美国燃起反种族歧视的怒火
    六千名学生在华盛顿游行示威
    要求让黑人白人学生合校求学
    新华社26日电　华盛顿消息：在美国各地广大社会人士的热烈支持下，美国六千名学生昨天在首都华盛顿举行游行示威，反对种族歧视，要求黑人和白人学生合校。这是美国人民最近许多年来在争取种族平等的战线上举行的规模最大的一次示威：“争取合校青年进军”。
    在经过充分的准备后，六千名学生25日分别从巴尔的摩、芝加哥、克利夫兰、底特律、纽约和费城等地来到了华盛顿。他们当中既有黑人，也有白人；既有基督教徒，也有天主教徒。他们是美国广大青年和学生的代表，其中大部分是坐着各大城市的工会组织和宗教组织为他们租赁的公共汽车来到华盛顿的。
    游行的队伍浩浩荡荡地走过了华盛顿的大街。他们带着的标语牌写着：“种族隔离侮辱人类的尊严”，“结束种族仇视，实行合校”。
    游行队伍派出的一个代表团在举行游行的前一天曾经要求会见美国总统艾森豪威尔，但是遭到了拒绝。这个代表团在游行的当天再次到白宫找艾森豪威尔，但是也给白宫的警卫挡住，他们被告诉说，艾森豪威尔打高尔夫球去了。
    艾森豪威尔这种漠视黑人权利的态度引起了代表团的极大愤慨。代表团留给艾森豪威尔的一份声明指出，美国南部现在正在由种族主义分子统治着，那里有的是迫害黑人的恐怖。声明要求审讯犯罪的种族主义分子，并且有效地保卫所有在学儿童的宪法和道义权利。
    游行群众在林肯纪念碑前举行了群众大会，参加大会的约有一万人。前美国著名黑人垒球健将罗宾森在大会上指出，这次示威是要向世界表明，“美国人民是反对种族歧视的，小石城并不是美国”。黑人著名歌手贝拉方特说，艾森豪威尔由于不接见游行群众的代表团，他已经向世界亿万人民作出了一个令人寻味的姿态。
    组织和领导这次示威游行的是美国黑人运动的中心组织全国有色人种协进会执行秘书威金斯、曾经在蒙哥马利城领导过黑人反对在公共汽车实行种族隔离的黑人牧师小马丁·路得·金和其他一些人，他们组成了“争取合校青年进军”组织。
