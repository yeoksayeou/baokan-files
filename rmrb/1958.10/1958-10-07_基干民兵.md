Basic-level Militia
Left shoulder with a hoe, right shoulder with a gun, marching in formation, singing aloud.
Wherever there is work, that's where we go, rushing to work as if on the battlefield.
Set up gun racks for farming, guns in hand during work breaks,
Training is no different from regular soldiers, bayonet drills and shooting, all kinds of skills.
Once foreign enemies run amok, resisting the enemy is like rushing to work.
Mountains can be moved and seas can be created, how can we not defeat stubborn bandits!

    基干民兵
    左肩锄头右肩枪，步伐整齐歌声扬。
    哪儿有活哪儿去，赶活犹如上战场。
    支起枪架事耕耨，干活休时枪在手，
    操练无异正规军，刺枪射击色色有。
    一朝外敌肆猖狂，迎敌犹如赶活忙。
    山可移兮海可造，焉有顽寇不能当！
