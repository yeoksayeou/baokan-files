Report from Daren: Here, the ground is starting to freeze. With this year's unprecedented bumper harvest of potato crops comes a new problem: how to ensure the safe, freeze-free winter transport of these potatoes is becoming increasingly urgent. Daren County in Shanxi Province, one of the main potato-producing areas, has provided effective methods in this regard, summarizing a set of experiences for winter potato transport.

Daren County's experience in winter potato transport mainly consists of: First, proper packaging. Their experience is that under normal circumstances, when the temperature is between minus three and eight degrees Celsius, double-layer burlap sacks are used for packing potatoes; when the temperature is below minus eight degrees Celsius, a paper bag made of three to five layers of hemp paper is added inside the double-layer burlap sack. The potato sacks should be filled tightly, layer by layer, and placed closely together in the carriage. The bottom of the carriage should be covered with two to three inches of wheat straw, and more straw, burlap sacks, and other coverings should be added on top and in areas susceptible to wind and cold. The gaps between the carriage edges, corners, and potato sacks should all be tightly packed with straw, thus improving cold and wind protection. Second, understand and grasp climate changes, and arrange transportation mileage and related activities according to the climate. For short-distance rural transport, bagging should be done indoors, preparations should be made, and the journey should be rushed during the higher temperatures after sunrise. For long-distance railway transport, covered wagons should be used. In addition to doing a good job in temporary storage, the loading time should be shortened as much as possible to avoid freezing. Warehouses at transportation hubs should not only prepare more straw and other covering equipment but also master the transportation progress, and schedule in a planned way to prevent excessive and prolonged accumulation and freezing at transportation hubs. Third, practically carry out inter-departmental collaboration around frost prevention. Unearthing, packaging, loading, shipping, as well as sending and receiving stations should all have clearly defined responsibilities, and establish inspection, acceptance, and contact systems. In addition, promote the "four combinations" method of transportation and sales, transportation and processing, transportation and storage, and transportation and transportation.

    冬运鲜薯保证不冻
    本报大仁电　这里开始上冻，随着今年薯类作物空前大丰收带来一个新问题——如何使薯类冬季运输安全不受冻，越来越急待解决。山西省山药蛋主要产地之一的大仁县在这方面提供了有效的办法，总结出一套冬季运输山药蛋的经验。
    大仁县冬季运输山药蛋的经验主要是：第一、妥善包装。他们的经验是在一般情况下，气温在零下三度到八度时，装山药蛋用双层麻袋；零下八度以上在双层麻袋里再加一个由三至五层麻纸制成的纸袋；山药蛋袋装满装实，一层层放在车厢里靠紧，车底铺上二、三寸厚的麦秸，上边和容易受风受寒的地方多加秸草、麻袋和其它复盖物。车厢边、角和山药蛋袋间空隙处都紧塞秸草，这样提高防寒防风能力。第二、了解、掌握气候变化情况，根据气候安排运输里程和有关活动。农村短途运送装袋时要在室内操作，作好准备，利用太阳出来气温较高时间抓紧赶程。火车长距离运输要用棚车，除作好临时存放工作，要尽量缩短装车时间，避免受冻。在交通点仓库除多准备秸草和其它覆盖设备外，要掌握好运输进度有计划地调度，防止交通点上积存过多、过久受冻。第三、围绕防冻切实开展部门之间协作工作。出窖、包装、装车、起运以及发站、收站都要明确职责，制定检查、验收和联系制度。另外推行运输与销售、运输与加工、运输与储存、运输与运输“四结合”办法。
