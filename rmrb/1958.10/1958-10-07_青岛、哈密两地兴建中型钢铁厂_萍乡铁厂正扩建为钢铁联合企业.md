Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao. The Qingdao Iron and Steel Plant recently started construction. It is the second newly started iron and steel complex in Shandong Province. Upon completion, it will produce 550,000 tons of iron and 400,000 tons of steel ingots annually, and will also produce round steel, flat steel, angle steel, light rails, thin plates, silicon steel sheets, and seamless steel pipes.

The plant is expected to complete the first blast furnace and its auxiliary equipment by the end of the year and put it into production in early next year; the entire project is striving to be completed and put into production in 1959.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the second iron and steel complex in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region – the Hami Iron and Steel Plant – began construction on the 1st.

The entire Hami Iron and Steel Plant project includes five blast furnaces ranging from 255 to 620 cubic meters, as well as converter steelmaking, rolling steel, coking, and chemical workshops; it will mainly produce large steel products such as steel rails and seamless steel pipes. Partial production is expected to begin next year, and the entire project will be completed by the first half of 1960, with an annual output of 800,000 tons of iron and 600,000 tons of steel.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Pingxiang Iron Plant in Jiangxi Province is being expanded into an iron and steel complex, and a blast furnace with a volume of 82 cubic meters has been completed and put into production on the 1st.

The second phase of earthwork for this plant has fully commenced, with plans to build four more 100 cubic meter blast furnaces, two 250 cubic meter blast furnaces, and three 6-ton converters.
