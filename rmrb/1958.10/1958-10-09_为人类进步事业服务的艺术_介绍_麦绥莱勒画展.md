Art Serving the Cause of Human Progress
    ——Introducing the "Masereel Exhibition"
   　Wang Qi
    The internationally renowned Belgian progressive artist Frans Masereel is not unfamiliar to Chinese readers. As early as twenty years ago, four of his wordless woodcut novels ("Passionate Journey", "Story Without Words", "My Book of Hours", "The Idea") were reprinted in our country. I think that anyone who has seen his work will never forget his profound ideological content, rich imagination and conception, powerful artistic expression, and original style.
    Now, Masereel has accepted the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit our country and hold a solo exhibition of his works in Beijing, which is extremely gratifying. These works were selected from his creations from 1917 to 1958, a period of about forty years, although they are only a very small part; but from here, one can see the author's entire creative spirit.
    The author lives in a capitalist society, which aroused his strong revulsion and disgust. In his works, those pot-bellied capitalists, nouveau riches, speculators, politicians, war maniacs... are all ridiculed and ruthlessly attacked by the author as vicious enemies. And for those exploited and persecuted working people, he has boundless sympathy and love.
    Some of Masereel's works are used to expose the darkness and ugliness of capitalist society. Unemployed workers wander and starve on the docks, wives drag children to beg in the streets, while a few wealthy people lead a life of extravagance in nightclubs; monopoly capitalists make huge fortunes by manufacturing arms, and imperialists drive large numbers of good people onto the battlefield in order to expand aggression. But the people are not so docile as to allow the rulers to manipulate their fate. They know how to unite, oppose wars of aggression, oppose exploitation, and actively struggle for peace and democracy... These themes are expressed particularly profoundly and powerfully in Masereel's paintings. From his exhibition, it seems as if we are unfolding a picture of the entire criminal capitalist society.
    Masereel is by no means recounting those well-known facts to everyone with the calm mood of an observer, but is making loud shouts from the screen with an unstoppable and excited mood, calling on everyone to fight against these unreasonable phenomena. In front of his works, what attracts us first is not the powerful lines; not the bright and beautiful black and white feeling; not the rigorous and complete structure; but what the screen tells us "what happened there," and especially the important thing is what "attitude to take" towards these things. In his view, art is not a simple repetition of objective things, but a vivid expression; art is not a statement of facts, but an ideological mobilization propaganda.
    In order to make works of art directly touch people's hearts; in order to deepen people's understanding of the criminal essence of capitalist society; Masereel is good at using powerful and sharp exaggeration techniques to highlight the events and characters in the picture. Therefore, in his works, sometimes the characters are handled larger than the houses, and hundreds of hands can be seen on the screen without heads and bodies... If these situations are to be measured by the basic laws of general painting, or compared with the real situation of facts, many places will appear to be "unreasonable," but if it is not used as a photograph of natural forms, but as an infectious work of art, this is not only allowed but also very necessary.
    Masereel is world-renowned for his woodcuts, and his woodcuts have a unique style. Many of his works are organized together through rich imagination and wonderful conception, putting different things or phenomena that occur in different places together; connecting the ideal and the reality together; and combining realistic and symbolic allegorical techniques together, forming a unified and complete structure. He is faithful to real life, but on this basis he fully develops the artist's abundant imagination and creativity.
    Masereel deserves to be a scourge of the old society and an accuser of the bourgeoisie. While capitalist society is rapidly disintegrating, the powerful socialist society is leaping upward. We believe that after recently visiting socialist countries, Masereel will surely produce many of the newest and most beautiful paintings that praise the new human society. (Attached picture)

    为人类进步事业服务的艺术
    ——介绍“麦绥莱勒画展”
   　王琦
    在国际上享有盛誉的比利时进步画家麦绥莱勒，对于中国的读者是不太生疏的。早在二十多年前，我国就翻印过他的四本木刻连环画（“光明的追求”“没有字的故事”“我的忏悔”“一个人的受难”）。我想，凡是看过他的作品的人，对于他的深湛的思想内容、丰富的想像和构思，强有力的艺术表现手腕和独创性的风格，都一直不能令人忘记。
    现在麦绥莱勒应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请，能够来我国访问，并在北京举行了他的个人作品展览会，这是万分令人欣慰的事情。这些作品是从他自1917年到1958年前后四十年的创作中挑选出来的，虽然仅是极小的一部分；可是从这里也足以看到作者的整个创作精神面貌。
    作者生活在资本主义社会，这个社会引起了他强烈的反感和憎恶。在他的笔下，那些大腹便便的资本家、暴发户、投机商、政客、战争狂人……都是被作者当作凶恶的敌人来加以嘲讽和无情的打击。而对于那些被剥削被迫害的劳动人民，则寄予无限的同情与热爱。
    麦绥莱勒在他的作品中，有的是用来揭露资本主义社会的黑暗与丑恶。失业工人在码头上流浪挨饿，妻子拉着儿童在街头求乞，而少数阔佬们却在夜总会里度着金迷纸醉的生活；垄断资本家靠制造军火大发横财，帝国主义为了扩大侵略而把大批善良人民驱上战场，可是人民并不是那末驯服，听任统治者来摆布他们的命运，他们知道团结起来，反对侵略战争，反对剥削，为争取和平民主而进行积极的斗争……。这些主题在麦绥莱勒的画上表现得特别深刻有力。从他的展览会里，好像给我们展开了一幅整个资本主义罪恶社会的图画。
    麦绥莱勒决不是以一个旁观者的、平静的心情，向大家娓娓叙述那些人所共知的事实，而是以不可遏止的激动的情绪，从画面上发出响亮的呼喊，号召大家去和这些不合理的现象进行斗争。在他的作品面前，首先吸引住我们的不是强有力的线条；不是明朗美丽的黑白感；不是严密完整的结构；而是画面上告诉我们“在那里发生了什么事情”，尤其重要的是要我们对这些事情“采取什么样的态度”。在他那里，艺术不是客观事物的简单重复，是生动的表现；艺术不是事实的陈述，是思想上的鼓动宣传。
    为了使艺术作品能直接打动人心；为了加深人们对于资本主义社会罪恶本质的认识；麦绥莱勒善于运用强有力的尖锐的夸张手法，来突出画面的事体和人物。所以在他的作品上，有时把人物处理得比屋子还要大，画面上可以看见几百只手而看不见人头和身体……这些情况，如果要用一般绘画的基本规律去衡量它，或者要以事实的真实情况去相比，就会有许多地方都显得是“不合理”，但如果不是作为一张复制自然形态的照片，而是作为一张感染人的艺术作品，这不仅是容许而且是十分必要的。
    麦绥莱勒是以木刻驰名世界的，他的木刻有独特的风格。他的许多作品都是经过丰富想像和奇妙构思，把不同的事物或发生在不是同一地点的现象组织在一起；把理想的和现实的联系在一起；把写实的和象征寓意性的手法揉和在一起；组成了统一完整的结构。他忠实于现实生活，却在这基础上充分发挥了艺术家充沛的想像力和创造性。
    麦绥莱勒不愧是一个旧社会的鞭挞者、资产阶级的控诉人。和资本主义社会正在急速瓦解的同时，强大的社会主义社会正在飞跃的上升。我们相信，麦绥莱勒在最近访问了社会主义国家以后，将会一定产生出许多歌颂人类新社会的最新最美的画幅。（附图片）
