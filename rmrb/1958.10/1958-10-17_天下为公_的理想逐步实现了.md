The Ideal of "Everything Under Heaven for the Public" is Gradually Being Realized
Hu Hua

During Comrade Liu Shaoqi's inspection of urban and rural areas in Jiangsu, the masses expressed their strong support for the implementation of the grain supply system. They said, "One worry has been put down, and another worry has arisen. What's been put down is the bitter worry of having to toil to eat and dress for thousands of years, and what has arisen is the worry of how to improve production even more, otherwise we would be letting down the Communist Party." Comrade Shaoqi believes that these two sentences, these two worries, are worthy of our deep consideration.

I think one of the thought-provoking things is that the ideal of "everything under heaven for the public" is gradually being realized!

"Everything under heaven for the public" is the ideal of outstanding Chinese people throughout history for human social systems and spiritual outlook. This phrase originally comes from the "Liyun" chapter of the "Book of Rites," written by people probably during the Warring States period. It says:

"When the Great Way prevails, everything under heaven is for the public. Talented and capable people are selected, and good faith is emphasized and harmony cultivated. Therefore, people do not care only for their own parents, nor do they care only for their own children. The elderly are provided for until death, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled are all cared for. Men have their duties, and women have their homes. People hate to see goods wasted on the ground, but they do not necessarily hoard them for themselves; they hate to see their strength not exerted, but they do not necessarily work only for themselves. Therefore, schemes are blocked and do not arise, and theft and rebellion do not occur, so outer doors are not closed. This is called Great Harmony." ("Collected Explanations of the Book of Rites," Volume 6)

This is a beautiful picture of high human morality and happy life. Of course, during the long years of slavery or small-scale peasant economy, this was just a beautiful fantasy. The revolutionary leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, in their promulgated "Land System of the Heavenly Dynasty," also partially reflected this ideal of the Chinese people. They wanted to realize this ideal by equally dividing the land. However, even after the land was equally divided, the peasants were still small private owners. Without changing the status of small private owners, it is impossible to achieve "everything under heaven for the public." Kang Youwei, who launched the Reform Movement of 1898, wrote "Datong Shu" (The Book of Great Unity) when he was still a reformist, describing a "world of Great Harmony" where "everything is equal." It can be said that he "dared to imagine," but he was ultimately a weak bourgeois reformer. This "imagining" was confined to his study and written on paper, so there was no question of finding a way to do it. Sun Yat-sen, as a revolutionary democrat of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, took "everything under heaven for the public" as the highest goal of the revolution. Sun Yat-sen died with his aspirations unfulfilled. Under the social conditions at the time, this slogan could only be his fantasy. The Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause, but continued to steal Sun Yat-sen's favorite slogan "everything under heaven for the public" as a fig leaf for their traitorous and self-serving activities. This was truly a great insult to this noble slogan of the Chinese people. The Kuomintang's twenty-two years of rule were the darkest and most reactionary corrupt politics in Chinese history.

In Chinese history, the Chinese Communists are the ones who truly possess the spirit of "everything under heaven for the public" and sacrifice and struggle for this goal. When the Chinese Communists were fighting for the communist ideal under extreme white terror, shedding their blood, advancing wave upon wave, and enduring all kinds of hardships, some bourgeois intellectuals who thought they were clever sighed and said, "Their ambition is commendable, but their foolishness is beyond compare." In the eyes of these exploiting class elements, people are all selfish and self-interested. People who are truly "for the public" do not exist. If there are any, they are complete fools.

But in no time at all, tremendous changes have taken place on the land of our motherland. With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the emergence of people's communes, people's spiritual outlook has begun to change, and has changed greatly. People with the spiritual outlook of "everything under heaven for the public," "one for all, all for one," are no longer a minority, but have begun to spread among the broad masses of workers and peasants. You go to the people's communes and take a look: the laughing children in the nurseries, the happy old people in the homes of happiness playing checkers peacefully in the sun, the young men and women carrying guns and rushing to plant wheat, the canteens with rich dishes, the clean bathrooms, the hospitals... All this shows that the ideal society of "the elderly are provided for until death, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured..." of "everything under heaven for the public" is no longer a fantasy, but is gradually becoming a reality. You go and see the plans of each commune, and they are all the most beautiful pictures, more magnificent, richer, and more beautiful than what is described in the "Liyun" chapter. And more importantly, communist ideology is universally surging. Everyone regards the commune as their home and strives wholeheartedly to realize the commune's plans. The morality and legal concepts of capitalism have begun to go bankrupt. The era of truly "everything under heaven for the public" has arrived. This is also a new dawn for mankind to move towards communism! We will soon see that this communist spirit of "everything under heaven for the public" will become the common moral standard and code of conduct for our country's 600 million people, and it will also profoundly affect the historical process of human society!

    “天下为公”的理想逐步实现了
    胡华
    刘少奇同志在视察江苏城乡时，群众反映非常赞成实行粮食供给制。他们说：“一个心思丢下了，一个心思又来了。丢下的是几千年愁吃愁穿的苦心思，又来的心思是怎样把生产搞得更好，不然就对不起共产党。”少奇同志认为：这两句话，二个心思，很值得我们深思。
    我觉得发人深思之一，就是“天下为公”的理想逐步实现了！
    “天下为公”，这是历来优秀的中国人对于人类社会制度和精神面貌的理想。这句话原出在大概是战国时代人所作的“礼记”一书的“礼运篇”上，是这样说的：
    “大道之行也，天下为公。选贤与能，讲信修睦。故人不独亲其亲，不独子其子。使老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，矜寡孤独废疾者，皆有所养。男有分，女有归。货恶其弃于地也，不必藏于己；力恶其不出于身也，不必为己；是故谋闭而不兴，盗窃乱贼而不作，故外户而不闭，是谓大同。”（“礼记集解”卷六）
    这是一幅人类高尚道德和幸福生活的美丽图画。当然，在悠长的奴隶制或小农经济的年代里，这只是一种美好的空想。太平天国的革命领袖们，在他们所颁发的“天朝田亩制度”中，也曾部分地反映了中国人民的这种理想，他们想用平分土地的方法来实现这种理想，但是，即使是平分土地以后，农民也仍然是小私有者，小私有者的状态不改变，做到“天下为公”是不可能的。发动戊戌变法的康有为，当他还是维新派时，他曾写了“大同书”，描述了一个“一切平等”的“大同世界”。他也可以说是“敢想”了，但是他究竟是一个软弱的资产阶级的改良派，这种“想”，只是关在书斋中、写在纸头上，当然谈不到寻找途径去干了。作为资产阶级和小资产阶级的革命民主派的孙中山先生，把“天下为公”作为革命的最高奋斗目标。孙中山是赍志以死的。在当时的社会条件下，这句口号也只能是他的空想。国民党反动派出卖了孙中山的革命事业，却继续盗用孙中山所喜爱的“天下为公”这句口号，作为他们卖国营私的遮羞布，这真是对中国人民这句崇高口号的莫大侮辱。国民党二十二年的统治，是中国历史上最黑暗反动的贪污政治。
    中国历史上真正具有“天下为公”的精神并为此目标而牺牲奋斗的，是中国共产党人。当中国共产党人在极端白色恐怖之下，抛头颅、洒热血、前仆后继、历尽千难万苦为共产主义理想而奋斗的时候，一些自以为聪明的资产阶级知识分子曾在一旁叹息说：“其志可嘉，其愚不可及也。”在这些剥削阶级分子看来，人都是自私自利的，真正“为公”的人是不存在的，如果有，那也是十足的大傻瓜。
    可是，曾几何时，在我们祖国的土地上，就发生了亘古未有的大变化。随着工农业生产的大跃进，人民公社的出现，人们的精神面貌开始变了，变了。具有“天下为公”“我为人人，人人为我”的精神面貌的人，已经不是少数人，而是开始普及到广大工农群众之中了。你走到人民公社看一看，欢笑着的托儿所的儿童，晒着太阳安详地下跳棋的幸福院的老人，架着枪突击种麦的青壮年男女，有着丰盛菜饭的食堂、清洁的浴室、医院……。这一切，显示着“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长……”的“天下为公”的理想社会，已不是空想，而逐步成为现实了。你去看一下每个公社的规划，那都是一幅幅最美好的图画，比“礼运篇”所描写的更加宏伟，更加丰富，更加美丽。而更加重要的，是共产主义思想的普遍高涨。人人把公社当作了家，一心一意为实现公社的规划而奋斗。资本主义的道德、法权观念开始破产了。真正“天下为公”的时代来到了。这也是人类通向共产主义的新的曙光！我们会很快地看见这种“天下为公”的共产主义精神将成为我国六亿人民共同的道德标准和生活准则，它也会深刻地影响人类社会的历史进程！
