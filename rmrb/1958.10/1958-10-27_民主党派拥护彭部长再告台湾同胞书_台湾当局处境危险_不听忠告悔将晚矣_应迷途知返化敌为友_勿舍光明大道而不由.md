Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement on the Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots released by our Ministry of National Defense. The statement is as follows:

    Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai has once again issued a letter to Taiwan compatriots, emphasizing that the affairs of the Chinese people can only be resolved by us Chinese ourselves and that we should not allow the Americans to interfere; he sincerely hopes that the Taiwan authorities will prioritize national righteousness, turn enemies into friends, and unite against external forces. We believe that the vast patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, as well as all Kuomintang members who do not want to be American slaves, will be deeply moved by this.

    Dulles used all kinds of political brokerage tactics, including coercion and fraud, during his visit to Taiwan; American news agencies' reports on the Dulles-Chiang talks further reflect the American authorities' utter humiliation of the Taiwan authorities. Taiwanese public opinion feels disappointed, humiliated, and indignant about this, and advocates taking control of their own destiny. This sentiment is completely understandable, and we sympathize with it. From this meeting, the Taiwan authorities should have a better understanding of the fox-like tricks and wolfish nature of American imperialism. All its actions are aimed at expanding aggression; all its practices are nothing more than making the Taiwan authorities a docile tool for its aggression. Not only is there no morality to speak of, but any malicious means can be used if it does not get its way. "The flower intends to follow the stream, but the stream has no feelings." The danger of the Taiwan authorities' situation is already clear. Under these circumstances, our Ministry of National Defense has decided to cease shelling on even days, so that Jinmen can be adequately supplied. If there is a shortage, we can also supply it as long as you ask. The Taiwan authorities should compare the two sides and see clearly who is the enemy and who is the compatriot. What to do, where to go, is there really any need for much consideration? We are very happy to hear that the Taiwan authorities are still talking about Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in his unity against external forces, and his decision not to dwell on past grievances. If the Taiwan authorities have not really forgotten Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they should inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great patriotic and anti-imperialist spirit. This is what we sincerely hope for.

    Dulles's conspiracy to create "two Chinas" will absolutely not succeed. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The vast military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are patriotic and will inevitably break free from the shackles of American imperialism and return to the embrace of the motherland one day. In order to defend the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we are determined to fight the American aggressors to the end; if the United States does not withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan region and stop its conspiracy to create "two Chinas" for even one day, our struggle will never cease. The United States' attempt to ease the pressure from domestic and foreign opponents by having the Taiwan authorities give up armed attacks on the mainland, and to deceive some timid people, is completely futile. The people of the world can see very clearly that to ease the tension in the Taiwan Strait and maintain peace in the Far East, the only way is for the United States to withdraw all its armed forces and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. With the support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, we are fully confident and capable of smashing any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism. The Americans absolutely must leave.

    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held a symposium on current affairs for several days to discuss the Chiang-Dulles talks and the Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots released by Minister Peng Dehuai of our Ministry of National Defense.

    During the symposium, everyone pointed out that based on the communique of the Chiang-Dulles talks and the information revealed by British and American news agencies, the US imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas," first isolate Taiwan, and then permanently occupy Taiwan, has been completely exposed. Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu are Chinese territory, and the affairs of the Chinese people can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves and have nothing to do with the Americans. Dulles insists on interfering, does he really have any affection for Chiang Kai-shek? The American imperialists are just playing a trick, using Taiwanese military and political personnel as sacrificial lambs, so that they can secretly put Taiwan and Penghu into their pockets. Isn't this very clear?

    At the symposium, those present all believed that the United States' plan to create "two Chinas" and occupy Taiwan is destined to fail. More than 600 million Chinese people will never agree. The more than 600 million Chinese people, combined with the powerful forces of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely smash the military threats and any conspiracies of the American paper tiger. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the current problem is that we must save the more than 10 million compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu, so that they no longer fall into the trap of American imperialism. In particular, Taiwanese military and political personnel should understand that the People's Liberation Army is adopting a method of fighting and stopping, half fighting and half stopping, in order to save you. Holding peace talks and turning enemies into friends is a great opportunity now. If you are still obsessed and fall into the trap set by Dulles, one day the Taipei "small court" will not be able to protect you, and the American imperialists will abandon you. The Huanggu Village Incident can serve as a lesson from the past, and you must be careful about this move.

    Those who participated in the symposium also unanimously believed that it is now time for the Taiwan authorities to think carefully, repeatedly, and make up their minds to choose their own path. If you are true believers in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, you should understand national righteousness and accept the advice put forward again by Minister Peng Dehuai. You must not succumb to the pressure of the Americans and lose your sovereignty by following others. Otherwise, as slaves of the Americans, you will end up with nowhere to live and be thrown into the sea.

    Xinhua News Agency, 26th: A spokesman for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League issued a written statement, supporting Minister Peng Dehuai's Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots. The statement is as follows:

    The Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots from Minister Peng Dehuai of our Ministry of National Defense thoroughly exposed the conspiracies and tricks of the American imperialists, thoroughly clarified national righteousness, and once again sincerely pointed out the path of light to the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League fully supports this proclamation.

    The activities and words of the American political broker Dulles in Taiwan recently have once again exposed that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world. The American aggressors' "thief crying stop thief" tactics and clumsy lies are no longer able to cover up the ferocious face of the American robbers. The American robbers are playing the conspiracy of "permanent ceasefire" and are stepping up the creation of "two Chinas," attempting to further isolate Taiwan and continue to arm and occupy Taiwan. Obviously, this chess move is just the first step in the conspiracy of the United States to directly administer Taiwan. The American robbers' conspiracy does not stop there. In the communique of the talks between Dulles and Chiang Kai-shek, and in Dulles's report to Eisenhower, they openly declared that their "mission is to restore freedom to the people on the mainland." The United States' purpose is to subvert our People's Republic of China. The American robbers also nakedly confessed that they want to maintain a "whole position in the West Pacific" including Taiwan, from Japan to New Zealand, in order to threaten and expand aggression against countries in the West Pacific region. The American aggressors' vicious conspiracy could not be clearer.

    The Second Letter to Taiwan Compatriots also clearly explains national righteousness. Our current method of fighting and stopping, half fighting and half stopping, in order to facilitate the supply of the Kuomintang army and the long-term defense of Jinmen, is to give the Taiwan authorities the opportunity to correct their course as soon as possible, strengthen unity, and unite against external forces. The Chinese people must drive the American aggressors out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait and liberate the Taiwan compatriots who are in deep trouble. All patriots have a way out. With the great national enemy in front of us! We hope that the compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu will unite with the people of the motherland to jointly and thoroughly smash the conspiracies of the American imperialists and return to the warm embrace of the motherland as soon as possible!

    民主党派拥护彭部长再告台湾同胞书
    台湾当局处境危险  不听忠告悔将晚矣
    应迷途知返化敌为友
    勿舍光明大道而不由
    新华社26日讯　中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深就我国防部发布的再告台湾同胞书发表谈话，文如下：
    我国防部彭德怀部长再度发表告台湾同胞书，强调指出中国人的事只能由我们中国人自己解决，不要让美国人插进一只手来；掬诚希望台湾当局能够以民族大义为重，化敌为友，一致对外。我们相信台、澎、金、马广大爱国军民同胞以及所有不愿做美国奴隶的国民党人都会为之深受感动的。
    杜勒斯这次到台湾，耍尽了政治掮客高压欺诈的手段；美国通讯社关于杜蒋会谈的报道，更反映出美国当局对台湾当局竭尽了侮辱之能事。台湾舆论界对此感到失望、屈辱、愤懑，主张自己掌握自己的命运，这种心情完全可以理解，我们是寄以同情的。从这次会谈，台湾当局应该更加认识了美帝国主义的狐狸伎俩和豺狼本相。它的一切行动，都是为了扩大侵略；一切做法，无非要使台湾当局做它进行侵略的驯服工具。不仅谈不上什么道义，稍不遂意，什么恶毒手段，都可以拿出来的。“落花有意，流水无情”，台湾当局处境的危险，已了如指掌。在此情况之下，我国防部决定每逢双日停止炮击，使金门可以供应无缺，如有不足，只要开口，我们还可以供应。台湾当局把两厢对照一下，谁是敌人，谁是同胞，就清清楚楚了。何去何从，难道还用得着多所考虑吗？我们很高兴听到台湾当局还在谈孙中山先生。孙中山先生之伟大，就是为了一致对外，决不计较往日的嫌隙。如果台湾当局真的还没有忘记孙中山先生，就应该继承孙中山先生伟大的爱国反帝精神，这是我们殷切期望的好事。
    杜勒斯制造两个中国的阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台、澎、金、马广大军民同胞是有爱国心的，必然有一天要挣脱美帝国主义的枷锁，回到祖国的怀抱。为了保卫我们领土主权的完整，为了保卫远东和世界的和平，我们决心与美国侵略者斗争到底；美国一天不从台湾地区撤退它的武装力量，停止制造两个中国的阴谋，我们的斗争也就一天决不罢休。美国妄图以台湾当局放弃武装进攻大陆来缓和国内外反对者的压力，欺骗一些怕事的人们，这完全是枉费心机的。全世界的人民都看得很清楚：要缓和台湾海峡地区的紧张局势，维持远东的和平，唯有美国撤退它的全部武装力量，停止对中国内政的干涉。在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，我们完全有信心、有力量粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，美国人不走是绝对不行的。
    新华社26日讯　中国民主同盟中央常务委员会连日举行时事座谈会，就蒋、杜会谈和我国防部彭德怀部长发布的再告台湾同胞书进行讨论。
    在座谈中，大家指出，从这次蒋杜会谈公报和英美新闻机关透露的消息来看，美帝国主义妄图制造两个中国，首先孤立台湾，然后永久霸占台湾的阴谋毒计，已经暴露无遗。台、澎、金、马是中国的领土，中国人的事只能由中国人来解决，和美国人毫不相干。杜勒斯偏要来插一手，难道他真的有所厚爱于蒋介石吗？美帝国主义者不过想玩一套手法，利用台湾军政人员作牺牲品，以便于偷偷地把台湾、澎湖装进它的腰包里，这还不是很明白了吗？
    在座谈中，到会的人都认为美国制造两个中国、霸占台湾的阴谋计划，是注定要失败的。六亿多的中国人民决不答应。六亿多的中国人民，加上全世界爱好和平人民的强大力量，一定会粉碎美国纸老虎的军事威胁和任何阴谋。会上发言的人指出，目前的问题是我们要拯救在台、澎、金、马的一千多万同胞，使他们不再落入美帝国主义的圈套。特别是台湾军政人员应该明白，人民解放军采取打打停停，半打半停的方式就是为了想拯救你们。进行和谈，化敌为友，现在是大好时机。要是你们仍然执迷不悟，落入杜勒斯布置的陷阱中间，会有一天，台北“小朝廷”保不住，美帝国主义会把你们抛弃掉的。皇姑屯事件可作前车之鉴，你们也得当心这一着。
  参加座谈的人还一致认为，现在是到了台湾当局反复三思，下决心选择自己的道路的时候了。假如你们是孙中山先生三民主义的真正信徒，就应当懂得民族大义，接受彭德怀部长再次提出的劝告，决不可屈服于美国人的压力，随人俯仰，丧失主权。要是不然，当美国人的奴隶，你们会弄到存身无地，被人丢到大海里去。
    新华社26日讯　台湾民主自治同盟发言人发表书面谈话，拥护彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书，文如下：
    我国国防部彭德怀部长的再告台湾同胞书，彻底揭露了美帝国主义者的阴谋诡计，透彻地阐明了民族大义，并再一次诚恳地给台、澎、金、马的军民同胞指出了光明大道。台湾民主自治同盟完全拥护这个文告。
    美国政治掮客杜勒斯最近在台湾的活动和他的言行又一次暴露了美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。美国侵略者的“贼喊捉贼”，欲盖弥彰的弥天大谎，再也无济于掩盖美国强盗的狰狞面目了。美国强盗玩弄“永久停火”的阴谋，又加紧制造“两个中国”，企图进一步孤立台湾和继续武装霸占台湾。很显然，这个棋步不过是美国直接托管台湾的阴谋的第一步。美国强盗的阴谋还不止于此，杜勒斯在与蒋介石的会谈公报，和杜勒斯向艾森豪威尔的报告中公开声称它们的“使命是使大陆上的人民重新获得自由”，美国的目的即是要颠复我中华人民共和国。美国强盗还赤裸裸地招供，它要坚持包括台湾在内的从日本到新西兰的一条“西太平洋的整个阵地”，以便对西太平洋地区的国家进行威胁和扩大侵略。美国侵略者的凶恶阴谋再清楚不过了。
    再告台湾同胞书又把民族大义讲的清清楚楚。我国目前采取的打打停停，半打半停，以利于国民党军队供应和长期固守金门，为的是给台湾当局能够早日迷途知返，加强团结，一致对外。中国人民一定要把美国侵略者从台湾和台湾海峡赶出去，把水深火热中的台湾同胞解放出来，一切爱国者都有出路。民族大敌当前！我们期望台、澎、金、马同胞与祖国人民团结一起，共同来彻底粉碎美帝国主义者的阴谋，早日回到祖国温暖的怀抱里来！
