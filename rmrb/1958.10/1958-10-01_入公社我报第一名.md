    I Report First for Joining the Commune
    Last night, the whole family went to a meeting,
    The benefits of the commune were explained clearly,
    Explained so brightly in my heart,
    My mouth smiled so wide it couldn't close.
    Walking home after the meeting,
    Smiling in my eyebrows, joy in my heart,
    Lying in bed, it was hard to close my eyes,
    Restless sitting, uneasy sleeping.
    Turning over and over, thinking carefully,
    Not afraid of the long night, nor the slow dawn,
    I ran to the headquarters that very night,
    With a smiling face, I knocked on the door.
    The cadre asked me what was the matter,
    I report first for joining the commune;
    The cadre asked me why I was in such a hurry,
    I spoke the words in my heart clearly.
    The small cooperative is not as good as the commune,
    With more people and greater strength, earth turns into gold,
    Every family has workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers,
    The people's commune radiates light.

### 入公社我报第一名

    入公社我报第一名昨晚全家去开会，公社好处讲得清，讲得心里堂堂亮，嘴巴笑得合不上。散会回家路上走，笑在眉头喜在心，上床躺着难合眼，坐不安来睡不宁。翻来复去仔细想，不怕夜长天不亮，连夜跑到指挥部，满脸含笑手拍门。干部问我为何事，入社我报第一名；干部问我为何急，我把心中话讲明。小社不如公社好，人多力大土变金，家有工农商学兵，人民公社放光明。广西　秦国明
