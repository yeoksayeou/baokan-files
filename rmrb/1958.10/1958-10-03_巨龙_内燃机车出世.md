Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: China's first 4,000-horsepower freight diesel locomotive was born on the 20th at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant.

This "Giant Dragon" type diesel locomotive is more than 33 meters long and streamlined. It has two sections, each equipped with a 2,000-horsepower diesel engine to drive a 1,350 kW DC generator, which generates electricity to propel the diesel locomotive forward. The "Giant Dragon" locomotive is one of the most powerful diesel locomotives in the world today. Compared with the steam locomotives currently widely used in China's railways, it has many advantages. The driver can use a button to automatically control the entire diesel locomotive. It can pull trains with a single section, or with two sections connected. When the two sections are connected, it can pull a train weighing 3,500 tons at a high speed of 100 kilometers per hour. This locomotive can operate in temperatures ranging from 40 degrees Celsius above zero to 45 degrees Celsius below zero, so it can run smoothly whether in the hot Turpan Basin or on the cold Heilongjiang grasslands. Filled with fuel and water, this locomotive can run continuously for 800 kilometers, making it possible to travel non-stop from Beijing to Xuzhou, or from Yumen to Lanzhou. It is particularly suitable for running on railways in the petroleum-rich and coal-water-poor Northwest. After the railway adopts diesel locomotives, the total operating cost and transportation cost can be reduced by about 35% compared to using steam locomotives.

The "Giant Dragon" type diesel locomotive extensively adopts the latest technological achievements in the world's diesel locomotive manufacturing industry, and its various technical and economic indicators have reached the world's advanced level. The successful manufacture of this domestically designed diesel locomotive marks that China's locomotive manufacturing industry has entered a new stage of manufacturing high-end products. All of the more than 100,000 parts of the "Giant Dragon" type diesel locomotive were manufactured by various factories in China in a short period of three months. (Attached picture)

    “巨龙”内燃机车出世
    据新华社讯　我国第一台四千马力货运内燃机车20日在大连机车车辆厂诞生。
    这台“巨龙”型的内燃机车全长三十三公尺多，呈流线型，共有两节车体，每节车体各装备一台两千马力的柴油机，用来带动一千三百五十瓩的直流发电机，发出电力，推动内燃机车前进。“巨龙”型机车是目前世界上马力最强大的内燃机车之一。它和我国铁路目前广泛使用的蒸汽机车比较，有许多优点。司机可以用电钮自动控制整个内燃机车运行。它可以单节车体牵引列车，也可以两节车体连挂牵引列车。它两节连挂时，可以牵引重达三千五百吨的列车，以每小时一百公里的高速度行驶。这台机车能在摄氏零上四十度到零下四十五度的气温条件下行驶，因此它无论在我国炎热的吐鲁番盆地，或在寒冷的黑龙江草原上，都能顺利地行驶。这台机车装满了燃料和水，能连续行驶八百公里，能够中途不停站，一直从北京开到徐州，或者从玉门开到兰州。它在石油丰富、煤水缺乏的大西北铁道上行驶特别适合。铁路采用内燃机车后，总运转费用和运输成本比采用蒸汽机车约能降低35％。
    “巨龙”型内燃机车广泛采用了世界内燃机车制造业最新的技术成就，它的各项技术经济指标达到了世界先进水平。这台我国自行设计的内燃机车制造成功，标志着我国机车制造工业跨进了制造高级产品的新阶段。“巨龙”型内燃机车十万多个零件全部是我国各工厂在三个月的短时间内制造出来的。（附图片）
