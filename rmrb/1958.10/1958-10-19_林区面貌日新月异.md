The Forest Area's Appearance Changes Day by Day

From 1950 to 1957, the country produced 121.66 million cubic meters of timber, basically guaranteeing the needs of national construction and the vast urban and rural population. If the national timber production in 1950 is taken as 100, then it was 264 in 1953, and will reach 476 in 1958. At present, there are 116 forestry bureaus engaged in timber production across the country, and many new bureaus are under construction. The annual output value of timber production was 900 million yuan in 1953, increased to 1.5 billion yuan in 1957, and is planned to reach at least 1.9 billion yuan this year.

China's state-owned natural forests are mainly distributed in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, Changbai Mountains in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, and the Minjiang River, Dadu River, and Yalong River basins in Southwest China. These places have vast tree seas, and the forest reserves account for about 80% of the total national reserves, and the timber production accounts for about 55% of the national production, which are China's main timber production bases.

As early as 1950, the Party put forward the policy of "rational felling, rational timber making, and rational utilization" for the forest industry, thoroughly changing the predatory felling methods of "shaving heads" and "pulling big hairs" by past rulers.

From 1953 to 1957, 2,621 kilometers of forest railways and 1,340 kilometers of timber transportation roads were newly built. The equipment such as various power saws, tractors, and trucks has been increasing year by year. The comprehensive mechanization ratio of timber felling, skidding, and transportation operations has increased from 17% in 1952 to 42% in 1957.

Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Anhui in the South are famous artificial forest areas in China. Many mountainous areas are distributed with verdant and towering Chinese fir, Masson pine and other timber forests. Farmers in the southern mountainous areas have a long tradition and rich experience in managing forests. In addition, the natural conditions are superior, rainfall is abundant, and trees grow rapidly, which is a good base for developing a large amount of timber. The state initially implemented unified management of timber purchase and sales in the southern forest areas, which improved the lives of forest farmers and gradually brought timber production into the orbit of the national plan.

    林区面貌日新月异
    从1950年到1957年，全国生产木材一亿二千一百六十六万立方公尺，基本上保证了国家建设与城乡广大人民的需要。全国木材产量如以1950年为一百，则1953年为264，1958年将达到476。现在各地从事木材生产的林业局有一百一十六个，并且有不少新局正在筹建中。木材产量的年产值1953年为九亿元，1957年增加到十五亿元，今年计划最低要达到十九亿元。
    我国国有天然林主要分布在东北、内蒙古的大小兴安岭、长白山和西南的岷江、大渡河、雅砻江流域，这些地方树海绵亘，森林蓄积量约占全国总蓄积量的80％，木材生产量约占全国产量的55％，是我国主要的木材生产基地。
    早在1950年，党对森林工业就提出了“合理采伐、合理造材、合理利用”的方针，彻底改变了历代统治“剃光头”“拔大毛”的掠夺采伐方式。
    从1953年到1957年新建了森林铁路二千六百二十一公里，运材公路一千三百四十公里，各种动力锯、拖拉机、载重汽车等设备，逐年都有增加，木材采伐、集材、运输作业的综合机械化比重，已由1952年的17％提高到1957年的42％。
    南方福建、广东、广西、贵州、江西、湖南、浙江、安徽是我国有名的人工林区，许多山区分布着苍郁挺秀的杉木、马尾松等等用材林。南方山区农民经营林木有悠久的传统和丰富的经验，加之自然条件优越，雨量充沛，林木生长迅速，这是大量发展木材的良好基地。国家对南方林区初期实行了木材购销统一经营管理，改善了林农生活，使木材生产逐步纳入了国家计划轨道。
