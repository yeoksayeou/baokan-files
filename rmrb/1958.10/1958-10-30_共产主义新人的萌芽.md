The Multi-Skilled Worker is a Product of the Great Leap Forward

After the Party put forward the general line for building socialism, China's construction advanced at a rate of "one day equals twenty years." In addition to completing their own heavy production tasks, industrial, mining, transportation, and construction enterprises also undertook tasks such as establishing satellite factories, supporting other enterprises, and supporting rural areas in establishing factories. This requires better utilization of labor and machinery, learning a variety of technologies, enabling machines to do more work, and one person to do the work of several people, overcoming the contradiction of labor shortages and idle time under the Great Leap Forward situation, and ensuring the completion and over-completion of production tasks. The broad masses of workers also demanded to better exert their subjective initiative and maximize their potential. The multi-skilled worker movement was launched under such circumstances. This is in line with the general line's requirements of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

With the development of mechanization and automation, social division of labor will inevitably become more and more detailed. At this time, is the technology that people master becoming more specialized? Or the opposite? Objective laws require people to master a variety of technologies, rather than becoming more and more specialized. Marx once said:

"...Large-scale industry, by its very nature, necessitates variation of labor, fluidity of functions, the worker's comprehensive mobility. On the other hand, in its capitalist form it reproduces the old division of labor with its ossified particularizations. We have seen how this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities of modern industry and the social character inherent in its capitalist form continually resolves itself in the slaughtering of great numbers of factory operatives, in premature crises, in the compulsory recognition of new machinery and the more complete division of labor. Modern industry, therefore, through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognizing, as a fundamental law of production, variation of work, consequently fitness of the worker for varied work, consequently the greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes." (Das Kapital, People's Publishing House, 1955 edition, Volume 1, page 596) Because the more developed the productive forces, the finer the division of labor, and the more important the role of collaboration in production, it requires closer cooperation, and cooperation requires mutual understanding of some of each other's business. Moreover, only by understanding more can one be more proficient in one's own technical work. If, like the social division of labor, the technology mastered by people becomes more and more specialized, then this increasingly narrow circle will further restrict people's activities and prevent them from exerting their intelligence and talents.

Many Benefits of Multi-Skilled Workers

"Multi-skilled worker" refers to a worker who has learned a variety of technologies, not only proficient and skilled in his own technical work, but also mastering several technologies related to his own work. This not only ensures the full utilization of labor and machinery in production, but also has a very profound significance: it enables people to be liberated from the shackles of lifelong "only knowing one skill and fixed to one position," obtain all-round development, and gradually narrow the gap between manual and mental labor. Therefore, the multi-skilled worker is a communist bud, one of the ways to gradually develop people into the "new person" needed by communist society.

Promote Technological Innovation

The emergence of multi-skilled workers liberates workers from "monotonously, mechanically, and lifelong repeating the same actions" (Engels: "Anti-Dühring"), people will be more interested in labor, and their physical and mental health will be better developed. In modern industry, machines occupy a very important position. The good or bad use of machines directly affects the quantity and quality of products. In the past, because operating workers did not understand the structure and performance of the machine, they could only operate but not repair it. When the machine malfunctioned, it was often not discovered in time, affecting the quality of the product. Even if it could be discovered in time, production was stopped because they could not repair it, affecting the progress of production. After the workers become multi-skilled, they can not only find faults in time, repair them, and improve production and quality, but also further carry out technological innovation and put forward rationalization proposals to transform machines, so that machines can fully play their role according to people's needs. In this way, workers are not only the masters of machines in terms of ownership, but also become the masters of machines in technology.

Beneficial to Unity and Cooperation

Multi-skilled workers will cause changes in workers' ideology. First of all, in the practice of learning multi-skilled skills, it is easy to appreciate the difficulties of other types of work, thereby understanding each other; and because "everyone is a teacher and learns from each other," the relationship between workers is more harmonious. Secondly, in the past, because workers only knew one technology, they could not help when other types of work had difficulties. After learning a variety of technologies, they can provide technical assistance, thus greatly benefiting unity and cooperation. Thirdly, because workers learn a variety of technologies, work in more processes, and are related to more people, the process of practice broadens the workers' horizons and makes them more clearly see the role of their own type of work in the entire production, and they can further understand the relationship between the individual and the collective.

Easy to Participate in Management

Workers need to be familiar with the entire production process and have comprehensive production knowledge in order to participate in the management of production. If workers only know one technology, they cannot adapt to the needs of social management of production. Moreover, because they only understand part but not the whole, they cannot more effectively supervise the work of leaders. The development of the multi-skilled worker movement enables employees to acquire more production knowledge, master the laws of production, and see problems comprehensively. This facilitates the participation of workers in management and resolves the contradiction between management and production.

Eliminate the Remnants of the Old Division of Labor

The multi-skilled worker takes a big step towards eliminating the remnants of the old division of labor, gradually narrowing the gap between simple labor and complex labor. At present, there are indeed high and low levels of technology mastered by workers, and the contradiction between simple labor and complex labor is one of the main contradictions in enterprises. Since liberation, the Party and the government have created many conditions to continuously improve the cultural and technical level of employees, so that the difference between simple labor and complex labor is gradually narrowing. The development of multi-skilled workers will further narrow this gap.

Since the emergence of large-scale machine industry, it has had the possible and necessary technical conditions for eliminating all the remnants of the old division of labor (separation of urban and rural areas; separation of simple labor and complex labor; separation of manual labor and mental labor). However, these are only technical conditions, and there must also be social conditions. Under the capitalist system, capitalists stubbornly preserve the old division of labor system for the benefit of their own class, making workers specialize in serving a part of the machine for life and becoming appendages of the machine. Only under socialist conditions is it possible to eliminate the remnants of the old division of labor. The development of multi-skilled workers is an important way to eliminate the remnants of the old division of labor.

At present, the multi-skilled worker movement is only just beginning, but it has shown strong vitality. This communist bud will surely grow and become stronger, so that people will develop from the current multi-skilled workers into "new people." The "new person" will be the person needed by communist society. At that time, "the common operation of production with the strength of the entire society and the new development of production caused by this also require a completely new type of people, and will create this new person." (Engels: "Principles of Communism") The "new person" is not the current multi-skilled worker who only understands a few technologies, but "...able to be familiar with the entire production system...alternately transfer from one production sector to another according to the needs of society or their own preferences." (Ibid.) The specific image is: "...each person does not have an exclusive field of activity, but can train himself in any industry, society regulates general production, so I can do this today, do that tomorrow, hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, raise livestock in the evening, and criticize after dinner, as I please, without having to be a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critic." (Marx and Engels: "The German Ideology")

Several Issues in Training Multi-Skilled Workers: Gradually Narrowing Wage Gaps

From the current point of view, the multi-skilled worker has only just begun, and the contradictions reflected in wages have not been largely, obviously, and sharply exposed, but since the multi-skilled worker is an inevitable requirement of objective development, the scope of the "ability" contributed in "from each according to his ability" will be expanded, and the quantity and quality of "ability" between people will become increasingly close, so we must gradually adapt the distribution to this change, so that wages are conducive to the transition to the communist distribution system. Specifically, the wage gap should be gradually narrowed. Engels said:

"In a society of private producers, the cost of educating skilled workers is borne by private individuals or their families; therefore, the higher wages of skilled labor are also first attributed to private individuals: skilled slaves sell for more, and skilled workers also receive higher wages. In a socialist organized society, this cost is paid by society, so the results created by complex labor, that is, more value, also belong to society, and the workers themselves cannot demand any additional compensation..." ("Anti-Dühring"). At present, the old division of labor has not been fundamentally eliminated, and there will still be some workers who are more skilled and others who are less skilled, so the contribution to society is different, so an appropriate gap must be maintained in wages. But it should not be too large, and it should be gradually narrowed or even eliminated, and transition to the communist principle of distribution.

Labor Organization Organized in Blocks

Should labor organizations be organized according to "lines" or "blocks"? Organizing according to "lines" means forming a production unit with the same type of work or a few types of work. This is most conducive to exchanging experience and unifying measures, but it cannot well adapt to changes in production tasks, timely allocate labor, and it is not easy for workers to learn a variety of technologies and obtain all-round development. If it is organized according to "blocks," it has great advantages. It is conducive to workers learning a variety of technologies and improving their technical level. It is also easy to allocate labor. Under the condition that it does not affect production, work can be allocated according to workers' interests and expertise, making labor more interesting. Therefore, after the development of the multi-skilled worker movement, labor organizations are required to provide conditions for learning and using a variety of technologies, so that labor organizations can also adapt to the development of multi-skilled workers and transition to communist labor organizations.

Cultivating a New Person

What should be done about the training of new workers? Is it to follow the old training methods of the past, or to cultivate them into multi-skilled workers from the beginning? In the early days of the founding of our country, in order to accelerate economic construction, it was required to train a large number of new workers to participate in production. In order to enable new workers to work independently as soon as possible, training was taken in a "single-handed" manner, fixing one position and specializing in learning for special use. This method promoted the development of productive forces at that time and was correct. But at present, adopting this method again is not conducive to the development of productive forces. Moreover, it has been proven theoretically and practically that it is not a matter of being unable to chew more than one can swallow, but that learning multiple subjects helps to master one subject. In the past, training was to set up training classes and transfer to other units to learn, but now on-site learning is adopted, learning while doing, so it can be learned quickly. In the new training system, attention should be paid to several issues: First, be proficient in one subject and know many subjects. Because my country implements a planned economy, the arrangement of labor is also planned, so when training new workers, each person should have a focus, and first be proficient in one technology, can work independently, on this premise, at the same time learn the technology related to their own work. Second, when training new workers, not only should they be trained to master a variety of technologies, but also cultivate the ability of workers to participate in management. Third, when training new workers, it is also necessary to combine cultural and technical education and political and ideological education to improve the cultural, technical, and theoretical levels and political levels of new workers. This training system can not only make new workers a multi-skilled worker, but also become a "new person" from the beginning.

    共产主义新人的萌芽
    北京大学经济系实习队
    多面手是大跃进的产物
    在党提出建设社会主义的总路线以后，我国建设以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进。工矿、交通、建筑等企业除了必须完成本身繁重的生产任务外，还担负着办卫星厂、支援其他企业、支援农村办工厂等任务。这就要求更好地利用劳动力与机器设备，学会多种技术，使机器能干更多的活，一人能顶数人用，克服在大跃进形势下劳动力有时不足、有时空闲的矛盾，保证完成和超额完成生产任务。广大职工群众也要求更好地发挥人的主观能动性，发挥最大的潜力。多面手运动就是在这样的形势下开展的。这正符合总路线的多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的要求。
    随着机械化、自动化的发展，社会分工必然越来越细，这时候，人掌握的技术是随着愈来愈专呢？还是反面？客观规律要求人掌握多种技术，而不是愈来愈专。马克思曾经说过：
  “……大工业还由它的激变自身……把劳动的变更和劳动者尽可能最大的多方面性，当作一般的社会的生产法则来承认，并使各种关系和这个法则的正常的实现相符合。”（“资本论”人民出版社1955年版第一卷596页）因为生产力愈发展，分工就愈细，协作在生产中的地位愈显得重要，也就要求更加紧密的配合，要配合就需要互相都懂得一些别人的业务。而且也只有懂得更多，才能对自己工种的技术更加精通，要是与社会分工一样，人掌握的技术也愈来愈专，那么这个越来越狭小的圈子就会更加束缚人的活动，使人不能发挥聪明才智。
    多面手的好处多
    “多面手”就是指一个工人学会多种技术，不仅能精通、熟练自己本工种的技术，而且还能掌握与本工种有关的若干技术，这样不仅保证在生产中能充分利用劳动力和机器设备，而且还有一个极其深远的意义：它使得人从终身“只通一艺、固定一职”的束缚中解放出来，获得全面发展，逐步缩小体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别。因此，多面手是共产主义萌芽，是使人逐步发展成为共产主义社会所需要的“全新的人”的途径之一。
    促进技术革新
    多面手的产生，使工人从“单调地机械地终身重复同一的动作”（恩格斯：“反杜林论”）中解放出来，人们对劳动将更有兴趣，使身心获得更健康的发展。在现代化工业中，机器占很重要的地位。机器利用的好坏直接影响产品的数量与质量。在以前由于运转工人不懂机器构造与性能，只会运转不会修理，在机器发生毛病时，往往不能及时发现而影响产品质量，即使能及时发现，也因为不会修理而停工，影响生产的进行。在工人成为多面手后，不仅能及时发现毛病，进行修理，提高产、质量，而且还能进一步进行技术革新，提出合理化建议来改造机器，使机器完全根据人的需要来发挥作用。这样，工人不仅在所有权上是机器的主人，而且在技术上也成为机器的主人。
    有利团结协作
    多面手会引起工人思想意识的变化。首先，在学习多面手的实践中容易体会其他工种的困难，从而互相谅解；而且由于“人人为师，彼此学习”，使得工人之间的关系更加融洽。其次，以前由于工人只懂一种技术，看到其他工种有困难也无法帮助，学会多种技术后，就可以从技术上给以帮助，因而大大有利于团结协作。第三，由于工人学习多种技术，在更多的工序工作，也与更多的人发生关系，在实践的过程中扩大了工人的眼界，更清楚的看到自己工种在整个生产中的作用，就能进一步认识个人与集体的关系。
    便于参加管理
    工人要参加管理生产，就需要通晓整个生产过程、具有全面的生产知识。如果工人只懂一种技术，是不能适应生产的社会管理需要的。而且由于只懂部分，不懂全面，也不能更有效的来监督领导的工作。多面手运动的开展，使职工获得更多的生产知识，掌握了生产规律，能全面的看问题。这就便于工人参加管理，解决了管理与生产的矛盾。
    消灭旧的分工残余
    多面手向消灭旧的分工残余跨前了一大步，使简单劳动与复杂劳动的差别逐渐缩小。在目前，工人掌握技术确有高低之分，简单劳动与复杂劳动的矛盾是目前企业主要矛盾之一。解放以来，党和政府创造了许多条件，不断提高职工的文化、技术水平，使简单劳动与复杂劳动之间的差别正在逐渐缩小。而多面手的发展，将更加缩小这种差别。
    自从机器大工业产生以后，就具备了消灭一切旧的分工（城乡分离；简单劳动与复杂劳动的分离；体力劳动与脑力劳动的分离）残余的可能与必要的技术条件。然而，这只是技术条件，还必须有社会条件。在资本主义制度下，资本家为了自己阶级的利益，把旧的分工制度顽固地保存下来，使工人终生专门服侍一个部分机器，成为机器的附属物。只有在社会主义条件下，才有可能消灭旧的分工残余。多面手的发展则是消灭旧的分工残余的一个重要的途径。
    目前多面手运动，还只是开始，但已显出了强大的生命力。这棵共产主义的萌芽必将成长和壮大，使人们从目前的多面手，发展成为“全新的人”。“全新的人”将是共产主义社会所需要的人，那时“用整个社会的力量来共同经营生产和由此而引起的生产的新发展，也需要一种全新的人，并将创造出这种新人来。”
  （恩格斯：“共产主义原理”）“全新的人”也不是目前只懂几种技术的多面手，而是“……能够熟悉整个生产系统……根据社会的需要或他们自己的爱好，轮流从一个生产部门转到另一个生产部门。”（同上）具体的形象就是：“……每人不是只有一个专属的活动领域，而是随便在哪一行业里都可锻炼自己，社会调节着一般生产，因而我也才能够今天做这个，明天做那个，早晨打猎，下午捕鱼，傍晚畜牧，饭后批评批评，随我兴之所至，用不着做猎人，做渔夫，做牧人，或做批评家。”（马克思、恩格斯：“德意志思想体系”）
    培养多面手的几个问题逐步缩小工资差距
    就目前来看，多面手还只是刚刚开展，反映在工资上的矛盾还没有大量地、明显地尖锐暴露出来，但既然多面手是客观形势发展的必然要求，“各尽所能”中贡献的“能”的范围将要扩大，人们之间“能”的数量、质量将日益接近，所以我们必须将分配逐步适应这种变化，使工资有利于向共产主义分配制度的过渡。具体的讲，应逐步缩小工资差距。恩格斯说：
  “在私人生产者的社会里，教养熟练劳动者的费用，是由私人或其家庭来负担的；所以熟练劳动力的较高工资，也首先是归于私人：熟练的奴隶，卖得贵些，熟练的工人也得到较高的工资。在社会主义地组织起来的社会里，这种费用，由社会来偿付，所以复杂劳动所创造的成果，即更多的价值，也归于社会，工人自身，不能要求任何额外报酬……”（“反杜林论”）。目前旧的分工还未根本消灭，还仍然会有一部分工人比较熟练，另外一部分差些，因而对社会贡献有所不同，所以工资上还需保持适当的差距。但不能太大，而且要逐渐缩小以至消灭，而向共产主义的分配原则过渡。
    劳动组织按块块组成
    劳动组织应当按“条条”组织，还是按“块块”组织？按“条条”组织就是将同一工种或少数工种组成一个生产单位，这样最有利于交流经验，统一措施，但却不能很好适应生产任务的变动，及时调配劳动力，也不便于工人学习多种技术，获得全面发展。如果是按“块块”组成，就具有极大的优越性。有利于工人学习多种技术，提高技术水平。也便于调配劳动力。在不影响生产的条件下，能根据工人爱好、特长来分配工作，使得劳动更有兴趣。所以，多面手运动开展后，要求劳动组织提供学习和运用多种技术的条件，使劳动组织也适应多面手的开展，向共产主义的劳动组织过渡。
    培养全新的人
    新工人的培训工作应当怎么办呢？是按照过去老一套的培训方法，还是一开始就培养成为多面手。我国建国初期，为了加速经济建设，要求培养大批新工人参加生产，为了使新工人早日独立工作，培训采取“单打一”，固定一职，专学专用的方法。这种方法在当时是促进了生产力的发展，是正确的。而在目前再采取这种办法就不利于生产力的发展。而且理论上与实践上已经证明不会贪多嚼不烂，而是学多门，有助于精一门。过去培训是成立培训班，外调其他单位学习，现在采取现场学习，边干边学，因此能很快学会。在新的培训制度中，应该注意几个问题：第一，精一门，通多门。由于我国实行计划经济，劳动力的安排也是有计划的，所以在培训新工人时，每人应有重点，首先应先精通一门技术，可以很好的独立工作，在这个前提下，同时又学会与自己工种有关的技术。第二，在培训新工人时，不仅要培训他们掌握多种技术，同时也培养工人参加管理的能力。第三，对新工人培训时，还要结合进行文化技术教育、政治思想教育，来提高新工人的文化、技术理论水平、政治水平。这样的培训制度，不仅能使新工人成为一个多面手，而且能一开始就成为“全新的人”。
