The Multi-Skilled Worker is a Product of the Great Leap Forward

After the Party put forward the general line for building socialism, China's construction advanced at a rate of "one day equals twenty years." In addition to completing their own heavy production tasks, industrial, mining, transportation, and construction enterprises also undertook tasks such as establishing satellite factories, supporting other enterprises, and supporting rural areas in establishing factories. This requires better utilization of labor and machinery, learning a variety of technologies, enabling machines to do more work, and one person to do the work of several people, overcoming the contradiction of labor shortages and idle time under the Great Leap Forward situation, and ensuring the completion and over-completion of production tasks. The broad masses of workers also demanded to better exert their subjective initiative and maximize their potential. The multi-skilled worker movement was launched under such circumstances. This is in line with the general line's requirements of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

With the development of mechanization and automation, social division of labor will inevitably become more and more detailed. At this time, is the technology that people master becoming more specialized? Or the opposite? Objective laws require people to master a variety of technologies, rather than becoming more and more specialized. Marx once said:

"...Large-scale industry, by its very nature, necessitates variation of labor, fluidity of functions, the worker's comprehensive mobility. On the other hand, in its capitalist form it reproduces the old division of labor with its ossified particularizations. We have seen how this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities of modern industry and the social character inherent in its capitalist form continually resolves itself in the slaughtering of great numbers of factory operatives, in premature crises, in the compulsory recognition of new machinery and the more complete division of labor. Modern industry, therefore, through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognizing, as a fundamental law of production, variation of work, consequently fitness of the worker for varied work, consequently the greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes." (Das Kapital, People's Publishing House, 1955 edition, Volume 1, page 596) Because the more developed the productive forces, the finer the division of labor, and the more important the role of collaboration in production, it requires closer cooperation, and cooperation requires mutual understanding of some of each other's business. Moreover, only by understanding more can one be more proficient in one's own technical work. If, like the social division of labor, the technology mastered by people becomes more and more specialized, then this increasingly narrow circle will further restrict people's activities and prevent them from exerting their intelligence and talents.

Many Benefits of Multi-Skilled Workers

"Multi-skilled worker" refers to a worker who has learned a variety of technologies, not only proficient and skilled in his own technical work, but also mastering several technologies related to his own work. This not only ensures the full utilization of labor and machinery in production, but also has a very profound significance: it enables people to be liberated from the shackles of lifelong "only knowing one skill and fixed to one position," obtain all-round development, and gradually narrow the gap between manual and mental labor. Therefore, the multi-skilled worker is a communist bud, one of the ways to gradually develop people into the "new person" needed by communist society.

Promote Technological Innovation

The emergence of multi-skilled workers liberates workers from "monotonously, mechanically, and lifelong repeating the same actions" (Engels: "Anti-DÃ¼hring"), people will be more interested in labor, and their physical and mental health will be better developed. In modern industry, machines occupy a very important position. The good or bad use of machines directly affects the quantity and quality of products. In the past, because operating workers did not understand the structure and performance of the machine, they could only operate but not repair it. When the machine malfunctioned, it was often not discovered in time, affecting the quality of the product. Even if it could be discovered in time, production was stopped because they could not repair it, affecting the progress of production. After the workers become multi-skilled, they can not only find faults in time, repair them, and improve production and quality, but also further carry out technological innovation and put forward rationalization proposals to transform machines, so that machines can fully play their role according to people's needs. In this way, workers are not only the masters of machines in terms of ownership, but also become the masters of machines in technology.

Beneficial to Unity and Cooperation

Multi-skilled workers will cause changes in workers' ideology. First of all, in the practice of learning multi-skilled skills, it is easy to appreciate the difficulties of other types of work, thereby understanding each other; and because "everyone is a teacher and learns from each other," the relationship between workers is more harmonious. Secondly, in the past, because workers only knew one technology, they could not help when other types of work had difficulties. After learning a variety of technologies, they can provide technical assistance, thus greatly benefiting unity and cooperation. Thirdly, because workers learn a variety of technologies, work in more processes, and are related to more people, the process of practice broadens the workers' horizons and makes them more clearly see the role of their own type of work in the entire production, and they can further understand the relationship between the individual and the collective.

Easy to Participate in Management

Workers need to be familiar with the entire production process and have comprehensive production knowledge in order to participate in the management of production. If workers only know one technology, they cannot adapt to the needs of social management of production. Moreover, because they only understand part but not the whole, they cannot more effectively supervise the work of leaders. The development of the multi-skilled worker movement enables employees to acquire more production knowledge, master the laws of production, and see problems comprehensively. This facilitates the participation of workers in management and resolves the contradiction between management and production.

Eliminate the Remnants of the Old Division of Labor

The multi-skilled worker takes a big step towards eliminating the remnants of the old division of labor, gradually narrowing the gap between simple labor and complex labor. At present, there are indeed high and low levels of technology mastered by workers, and the contradiction between simple labor and complex labor is one of the main contradictions in enterprises. Since liberation, the Party and the government have created many conditions to continuously improve the cultural and technical level of employees, so that the difference between simple labor and complex labor is gradually narrowing. The development of multi-skilled workers will further narrow this gap.

Since the emergence of large-scale machine industry, it has had the possible and necessary technical conditions for eliminating all the remnants of the old division of labor (separation of urban and rural areas; separation of simple labor and complex labor; separation of manual labor and mental labor). However, these are only technical conditions, and there must also be social conditions. Under the capitalist system, capitalists stubbornly preserve the old division of labor system for the benefit of their own class, making workers specialize in serving a part of the machine for life and becoming appendages of the machine. Only under socialist conditions is it possible to eliminate the remnants of the old division of labor. The development of multi-skilled workers is an important way to eliminate the remnants of the old division of labor.

At present, the multi-skilled worker movement is only just beginning, but it has shown strong vitality. This communist bud will surely grow and become stronger, so that people will develop from the current multi-skilled workers into "new people." The "new person" will be the person needed by communist society. At that time, "the common operation of production with the strength of the entire society and the new development of production caused by this also require a completely new type of people, and will create this new person." (Engels: "Principles of Communism") The "new person" is not the current multi-skilled worker who only understands a few technologies, but "...able to be familiar with the entire production system...alternately transfer from one production sector to another according to the needs of society or their own preferences." (Ibid.) The specific image is: "...each person does not have an exclusive field of activity, but can train himself in any industry, society regulates general production, so I can do this today, do that tomorrow, hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, raise livestock in the evening, and criticize after dinner, as I please, without having to be a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critic." (Marx and Engels: "The German Ideology")

Several Issues in Training Multi-Skilled Workers: Gradually Narrowing Wage Gaps

From the current point of view, the multi-skilled worker has only just begun, and the contradictions reflected in wages have not been largely, obviously, and sharply exposed, but since the multi-skilled worker is an inevitable requirement of objective development, the scope of the "ability" contributed in "from each according to his ability" will be expanded, and the quantity and quality of "ability" between people will become increasingly close, so we must gradually adapt the distribution to this change, so that wages are conducive to the transition to the communist distribution system. Specifically, the wage gap should be gradually narrowed. Engels said:

"In a society of private producers, the cost of educating skilled workers is borne by private individuals or their families; therefore, the higher wages of skilled labor are also first attributed to private individuals: skilled slaves sell for more, and skilled workers also receive higher wages. In a socialist organized society, this cost is paid by society, so the results created by complex labor, that is, more value, also belong to society, and the workers themselves cannot demand any additional compensation..." ("Anti-DÃ¼hring"). At present, the old division of labor has not been fundamentally eliminated, and there will still be some workers who are more skilled and others who are less skilled, so the contribution to society is different, so an appropriate gap must be maintained in wages. But it should not be too large, and it should be gradually narrowed or even eliminated, and transition to the communist principle of distribution.

Labor Organization Organized in Blocks

Should labor organizations be organized according to "lines" or "blocks"? Organizing according to "lines" means forming a production unit with the same type of work or a few types of work. This is most conducive to exchanging experience and unifying measures, but it cannot well adapt to changes in production tasks, timely allocate labor, and it is not easy for workers to learn a variety of technologies and obtain all-round development. If it is organized according to "blocks," it has great advantages. It is conducive to workers learning a variety of technologies and improving their technical level. It is also easy to allocate labor. Under the condition that it does not affect production, work can be allocated according to workers' interests and expertise, making labor more interesting. Therefore, after the development of the multi-skilled worker movement, labor organizations are required to provide conditions for learning and using a variety of technologies, so that labor organizations can also adapt to the development of multi-skilled workers and transition to communist labor organizations.

Cultivating a New Person

What should be done about the training of new workers? Is it to follow the old training methods of the past, or to cultivate them into multi-skilled workers from the beginning? In the early days of the founding of our country, in order to accelerate economic construction, it was required to train a large number of new workers to participate in production. In order to enable new workers to work independently as soon as possible, training was taken in a "single-handed" manner, fixing one position and specializing in learning for special use. This method promoted the development of productive forces at that time and was correct. But at present, adopting this method again is not conducive to the development of productive forces. Moreover, it has been proven theoretically and practically that it is not a matter of being unable to chew more than one can swallow, but that learning multiple subjects helps to master one subject. In the past, training was to set up training classes and transfer to other units to learn, but now on-site learning is adopted, learning while doing, so it can be learned quickly. In the new training system, attention should be paid to several issues: First, be proficient in one subject and know many subjects. Because my country implements a planned economy, the arrangement of labor is also planned, so when training new workers, each person should have a focus, and first be proficient in one technology, can work independently, on this premise, at the same time learn the technology related to their own work. Second, when training new workers, not only should they be trained to master a variety of technologies, but also cultivate the ability of workers to participate in management. Third, when training new workers, it is also necessary to combine cultural and technical education and political and ideological education to improve the cultural, technical, and theoretical levels and political levels of new workers. This training system can not only make new workers a multi-skilled worker, but also become a "new person" from the beginning.
