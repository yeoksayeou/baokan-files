	Celebrating the National Day with a bumper harvest, let's leap forward again!
	As the people of the whole country joyfully celebrate the National Day, an unprecedented bumper harvest is appearing on the vast land of the motherland. Since the summer, we have successively obtained bumper harvests of wheat, rapeseed, early rice, and middle rice, and now we have obtained a bumper harvest of autumn crops. According to the agricultural department's estimates, this year the national grain output will reach more than 700 billion catties, an increase of about 100% compared with last year. The increase in grain production this year alone is more than five times the total of the annual incremental figures (62.5 billion catties) during the First Five-Year Plan. This year's total cotton output will reach 70 million dan, an increase of more than 100% compared with last year. This is a glorious victory on the agricultural front in our country, and the people of the whole country are proud of it. On this day of national celebration and bumper harvest, let us warmly salute the farmer brothers who created this great victory!
	The bumper harvest in agriculture is of great direct significance not only for improving the lives of the people of our country but also greatly accelerates the progress of socialist construction in our country.
	We are pleased to see that this year's bumper harvest has basically solved the food problem in our country. And we believe that the food problem in our country will be completely solved in the end in another year. This year, the national per capita share of grain will jump from 570 catties last year to 1,000 catties. Some provinces will have an average of 1,500 catties or more of grain per person. Some people's communes have already begun to implement a grain supply system, which means that in these places, eating does not cost money. It is a remarkable thing to basically solve the food problem in a large country with a population accounting for nearly a quarter of the world's population. With abundant grain, we can increase grain for feed, accelerate the development of animal husbandry, and increase the production and supply of meat and milk products. When Comrade Mao Zedong received the director of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Henan Province in June this year, he proposed the following figures: a national average of 1,500 catties of grain, 100 catties of pork, 20 catties of oil, and 20 catties of lint cotton per person per year. These figures mark the happy life of the people with adequate food and clothing, which is no longer a distant ideal but a goal that can be achieved within two or three years.
	Agriculture is an important source of industrial raw materials and funds, and the countryside is a vast market for industrial products. The great leap forward in agricultural production not only gives a strong stimulus and impetus to industry, accelerating the pace of industrial development to meet the enormous needs generated by the great leap forward in agricultural production, but also creates favorable conditions for the broad masses of farmers to run industries directly. The millions of farmers running industries echo the state-run industries, forming the current great upsurge of the whole people running industries. At present, all the people of our country are fighting for steel. In this great battle, farmers are a strong new force. The hundreds of thousands of indigenous blast furnaces that have appeared in various places have been built directly relying on the strength of the peasants. If there were no great leap forward in agriculture, how could farmers have such great strength to support and participate in industrial construction?
	The great leap forward in agriculture has promoted the great leap forward in industry; and the result of the great leap forward in industry will also accelerate the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and will supply agriculture with more chemical fertilizers and pesticides. This is the close relationship of mutual promotion and mutual support between industry and agriculture in our country, advancing side by side. The worker-peasant alliance in our country will be consolidated and strengthened on this new economic foundation.
	Since the spring of this year, the clarion call of cultural revolution and technological revolution has resounded throughout the vast countryside. Farmer-run universities, middle schools, red and expert schools, primary schools, and kindergartens have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Farmer-run libraries, drama troupes, hospitals, and maternity hospitals are also rapidly increasing. The popularization of education movement, the literacy campaign, the elimination of the four pests movement, and sports activities are sweeping away the ignorant and backward rural outlook left over from thousands of years with an irresistible momentum. Now, many farmers are studying science and reading philosophy, and many farmers are engaged in invention and creation. Just imagine, if there were no encouragement from the great leap forward in agricultural production, if there were no solid material conditions provided by the bumper harvest in agriculture, how could there be such a magnificent high tide of cultural construction?
	In the all-round leap forward in agricultural production, a mass movement to build people's communes has risen in the rural areas of the whole country. The rise of this new mass movement is an inevitable trend in the development of the great leap forward in socialist construction in the country, especially the great leap forward in agriculture. In the process of the great leap forward, the communist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers is rising day by day, and their horizons are expanding day by day. They not only demand the comprehensive development of agricultural production but also demand the acceleration of the realization of rural mechanization, electrification, and urbanization, and the construction of their own prosperous and civilized happy life in many ways. Under such circumstances, the original single agricultural production cooperatives with only dozens or hundreds of members could no longer meet the requirements of the leaping development of productive forces, and it was necessary to establish people's communes with comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and the mutual combination of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. This is how our party and people quickly found the people's commune, the best organizational form for building socialism and gradually transitioning to communism, in the great leap forward in agricultural production. Now the whole country is realizing the people's commune. It can be fully believed that due to the victorious realization of the people's commune, our country will certainly build socialism ahead of schedule and gradually transition to communism.
	This year's bumper harvest in agriculture has brought abundant material wealth to the people of our country, and it has also brought abundant political and ideological wealth. The fact of the bumper harvest proves that the victory of the socialist system, the victory of the party's general line for socialist construction, and all the right-leaning conservative arguments such as the theory of conditions, the theory of habits, and the theory of regional backwardness have been completely bankrupt. The "wait and see" faction and the "settling accounts after autumn" faction have been completely defeated. Dialectical materialism has radiated brilliant light in the struggle against various metaphysical ideas. All those who spread pessimism and skepticism about the great leap forward in agricultural production have been miserably defeated on a fundamental issue, that is, they always underestimate the strength and role of the people; they do not believe that the awakened hundreds of millions of people can create miracles that have no precedent in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Contrary to this idea, Marxism has always firmly believed that the people create history. Among all the factors of production, people are the most valuable and decisive factor. When hundreds of millions of people have found their own path to happiness and are determined to be the masters of nature, amazing miracles will emerge endlessly under their hands. This is the most beneficial lesson provided to us by this year's unprecedented bumper harvest in agriculture.
	The extremely rich experience created by the farmers of our country in the great leap forward in agricultural production is also of profound significance for the further development of scientific theory. In the past, when people considered the growth rate of agriculture, they always thought of the usual practice of annual growth of a few percent; however, this year the growth rate of agriculture in our country has not been a few percent or tens of percent but has grown several times. In the past, when people talked about accelerating the development of agriculture, they thought only of modern technical equipment such as agricultural machinery, liquid fuels, and chemical fertilizers; however, this year's bumper harvest in our country has made agriculture grow at an unprecedented rate without a large number of tractors and chemical fertilizers. Once our agriculture is equipped with modern technology, there will certainly be an even more amazing growth rate. In the past, people only knew that industry drives agriculture and that industry determines the development speed of agriculture; however, in the specific situation of our country, it is agriculture that drives industry, forcing industry to make a great leap forward. These new issues have opened people's eyes, enriched people's knowledge of the economic laws of socialist society, and inspired people to absorb new practical experience to explore and develop socialist political economics. In addition, in terms of yield-increasing technical measures, the creations and developments of the broad masses of farmers in the practice of striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture have also opened up broad paths for the development of new agricultural science. These experiences have been summarized as the five key factors for increasing production: water conservancy, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and close planting. These facts once again prove that science must develop by taking the path of combining theory and practice. This is of particularly profound educational significance for our agricultural scientists.
	We are adherents of the theory of continuous revolution. When celebrating this year's bumper harvest in agriculture, we will never be complacent and satisfied with the enormous achievements we have already made, but will draw greater confidence and strength from this year's bumper harvest and strive for an even greater harvest next year. It should be seen that although this year's bumper harvest has doubled the output of various agricultural products in our country, our grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar crops, meat, milk, etc., have not yet reached the ideal standards to ensure national construction and the people's well-being. It should also be seen that the dispersion of agricultural production itself and the instability caused by natural disasters, as well as the imbalance in the development of work, still affect agricultural production in our country more or less. Therefore, we must continue to exert our efforts and complete the task of three years of hard work with continued efforts. In 1959, we must not only fundamentally solve the grain problem and the cotton problem, but also meet the needs of the state and the people for oilseeds, bast fiber crops, and other cash crops, and ensure the development of the entire national economy. Let us continue to exert our efforts and strive for the best, and under the red flag of the party's general line for socialist construction, start a new battle to realize a greater leap forward in agricultural production next year!

### 庆丰收，再跃进！

    庆丰收，再跃进！
    在全国人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接国庆节的时候，祖国辽阔无边的大地上正呈现着空前未有的大丰收景象。夏季以来，我们已经先后获得了小麦、油菜、早稻、中稻的大丰收，现在又获得了秋熟作物的大丰收。据农业部门预计，今年全国粮食产量将达七千多亿斤，比去年增产一倍左右。今年一年增产的粮食等于第一个五年计划期间历年递增数字总和（六百二十五亿斤）的五倍多。今年的棉花总产量将达七千万担，比去年增加一倍以上。这是我国农业战线上的辉煌胜利，全国人民都为此感到自豪。当此举国欢庆国庆节、欢庆大丰收的日子，让我们向创造了这个伟大胜利的农民弟兄们热诚地致敬！
    农业大丰收不仅对改善我国人民的生活有巨大的直接的意义，而且大大地加快了我国社会主义的建设进度。
    我们高兴地看到，今年的大丰收，使我国的粮食问题基本上解决了。并且相信再有一年，我国的粮食问题将会最后得到完全的解决。今年全国每人平均占有的粮食将从去年的五百七十斤跃增到一千斤。有些省份平均每人将有一千五百斤以至更多的粮食。有一部分人民公社已经开始实行粮食供给制，就是说，在这些地方吃饭不要钱了。在一个人口几占世界四分之一的大国里基本解决粮食问题，这是一件了不起的大事。有了丰富的粮食，就可以增加饲料用粮，加速发展畜牧业，增加肉类、奶品的生产和供应。毛泽东同志在今年6月接见河南省应举农业社社长的时候，曾经提出这样几项数字：全国每人每年平均一千五百斤粮食、一百斤猪肉、二十斤油、二十斤皮棉。这几项数字标志着人民丰衣足食的幸福生活，已经不是遥远的理想，而是两三年内就可以实现的目标了。　农业是工业原料和资金的重要来源，农村是工业品的广阔市场。农业生产的大跃进，不仅给工业以强烈的刺激和推动，使工业加快发展速度，以满足由于农业生产大跃进而产生的巨大需要；而且也创造了广大农民直接办工业的有利条件。千百万农民办工业，同国家办工业相呼应，就形成了当前全民办工业的巨大浪潮。目前我国全体人民正在为钢铁而战。在这场大战中，农民是一支强大的生力军。各地出现的几十万座土高炉，就是直接依靠农民的力量办起来的。如果没有农业的大跃进，农民怎么能有这么大的力量支援并且参加工业建设呢？
    农业的大跃进推动了工业的大跃进；而工业大跃进的结果，也将加速农业的机械化、电气化，将供给农业以更多的化学肥料和农药。这就是我国的工农业互相推动、互相支援、并肩跃进的亲密关系。我国的工农联盟将在这个新的经济基础上巩固和加强起来。
    今年春季以来，文化革命和技术革命的号角响遍了广大的农村。农民自办的大学、中学、红专学校、小学和幼儿园，像雨后春笋般地大量涌现。农民自办的图书馆、剧团、医院、产妇院也在迅速增加。普及教育运动、扫盲运动、除四害运动、体育运动都以锐不可当的气势，扫除着千百年来遗留下来的愚昧落后的农村面貌。现在，有许多农民在钻科学、读哲学，有许多农民在从事发明创造。试想如果没有农业生产大跃进的鼓舞，如果没有农业大丰收所提供雄厚的物质条件，怎么会有这样波澜壮阔的文化建设高潮呢？
    在农业生产的全面跃进中，在全国农村中兴起了一个建设人民公社的群众运动。这个新的群众运动的兴起，是全国社会主义建设大跃进首先是农业大跃进的形势发展的必然趋势。在大跃进的过程中，广大农民的共产主义觉悟日益高涨，眼界日益开旷。他们不但要求全面地发展农业生产，而且要求加速实现农村的机械化、电气化和城市化，从多方面建设自己的富裕和文明的幸福生活。在这样的形势下，原来的只有几十户、几百户社员的单一的农业生产合作社已经不能适应生产力飞跃发展的要求，必须建立农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵互相结合的人民公社。我们的党和人民就是这样在农业生产大跃进中很快地找到了人民公社这个建设社会主义并逐步向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式的。现在全国正在实现人民公社化。完全可以相信，由于人民公社化的胜利实现，我国一定会提前建成社会主义并逐步过渡到共产主义。
    今年的农业大丰收给我国人民带来了丰硕的物质财富，也带来了丰硕的政治思想的财富。大丰收的事实证明，社会主义制度的胜利，党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，一切条件论、习惯论、地区落后论等等右倾保守的论调都彻底地破产了。观潮派、秋后算账派彻底失败了。辩证唯物主义在同各种形而上学思想的斗争中，放出了灿烂的光辉。所有对农业生产大跃进散布悲观论和怀疑论的人，都在一个根本问题上惨败了，这就是他们总是对人民群众的力量和作用估计得过低；他们不相信觉醒了的亿万群众能够创造古今中外都没有先例的奇迹。和这种思想恰恰相反，马克思主义从来都坚定地认为：人民群众创造历史。在生产的一切因素中，人是最宝贵最有决定性的因素。当亿万人民找到了自己的奔向幸福的道路、决心做自然的主人的时候，惊人的奇迹就会在他们的手下层出不穷地创造出来。这就是今年的农业空前大丰收，向我们提供的最有益的教训。
    我国农民在农业生产大跃进中所创造的极其丰富的经验，对于进一步发展科学理论也具有深刻的意义。从前人们考虑农业增长速度的时候，想到的总是每年增长百分之几的惯例；可是，今年我国的农业增长率已经不是百分之几或几十而是成倍地增长了。从前人们谈论加速发展农业的时候，想到的只是农业机械、液体燃料和化学肥料等等近代技术装备；可是，我国今年的大丰收却是在没有大量拖拉机和化学肥料的情况下使农业以空前未有的速度向上猛长。一旦我国的农业用现代技术装配起来，那就一定会出现更加惊人的增长速度。从前人们只知道工业带动农业，工业决定农业的发展速度；可是在我国的具体情况下却是农业带动了工业，逼得工业向前大跃进。这些新问题都给人们打开了眼界，丰富了人们对于社会主义社会经济规律的知识，启发人们吸取新的实践经验，去探讨和发展社会主义政治经济学。此外，在增产技术措施方面，广大农民在争取农业大丰收的实践中的创造和发展，也为新的农业科学的发展开拓了广阔的道路。这些经验已被概括为水利、肥料、土壤、种子、密植五大增产关键。这些事实再一次证明，科学要发展，必须走理论与实践相结合的道路。这一点对于我们的农业科学家特别有着深刻的教育意义。
    我们是不断革命论者，在庆祝今年农业大丰收的时候，我们决不会因为已有的巨大成绩而自满自足，而要从今年这个大丰收中汲取更大的信心和力量，争取明年更大的丰收。应该看到，虽然今年的大丰收使我国的各类农产品产量成倍地增加了，但是我们的粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、肉类、奶品等等，都还没有达到保证国家建设和人民丰衣足食的理想标准。还应该看到，农业生产本身的分散性和自然灾害所造成的不稳定性，以及工作发展的不平衡，都还或多或少地影响着我国的农业生产。因此，我们必须继续鼓足干劲，再接再厉地完成苦战三年的任务。在1959年，我们不仅要根本解决粮食问题和棉花问题，而且要满足国家和人民对油料、麻类等经济作物的需要，保证整个国民经济的发展。让我们继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，在党的社会主义建设总路线的红旗下，为实现明年农业生产的更大跃进而开始新的战斗！
