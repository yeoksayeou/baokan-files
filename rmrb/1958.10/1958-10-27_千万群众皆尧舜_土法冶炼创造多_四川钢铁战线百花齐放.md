Millions of People are All Yao and Shun: Indigenous Smelting Creates More
Sichuan's Iron and Steel Front Blooms

(Our newspaper's Chongqing dispatch, October 26th) The policy of small-scale indigenous groups has inspired the creativity of millions of people. On Sichuan's iron and steel front, a vibrant situation has emerged, with a hundred flowers blooming and diverse smelting methods competing simultaneously.

In order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses from various aspects, the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee and the Party committees of many regions attach great importance to the many good smelting methods promoted by various localities based on local conditions and traditional experience. The responsible comrades of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee personally managed (experimental furnaces) and convened on-site meetings to carefully summarize and promote the "stir-fried twice-cooked pork" iron-smelting method created by cadres and the masses in the Luzhou Special District. This method divides iron smelting into two steps: first, the ore is smelted into sintered iron, and then the sintered iron, coke, and limestone are placed in indigenous blast furnaces or various furnaces capable of melting iron to melt into molten iron. Because it is carried out in two steps, the amount of heat required for each smelting is not as large as the heat required for indigenous blast furnaces to directly smelt raw iron from ore, so the air volume and air pressure are easy to control, and the operation is very simple. The original brick and tile kilns, lime kilns, pottery kilns, charcoal kilns, and ordinary cooking stoves in various places can all be used to refine sintered iron. In addition to indigenous blast furnaces, gasoline drums can also be modified into small iron-smelting furnaces to turn sintered iron into raw iron. Only one person is needed to blow air and one person to add materials and remove slag. In this way, every commune, every household can smelt iron. Counties such as Xuyong and Qijiang in Sichuan use this method to increase production by 50% to more than 100% compared to indigenous blast furnaces directly melting ore into raw iron. A method of smelting iron in jars recently successfully tested by the people of Xuyong County, Sichuan, is also very convenient to promote in rural areas. This iron-smelting method is a synthesis of the principles of primitive iron-smelting and crucible steel-making. The roasted ore, limestone, white coal powder, and slurry powder (i.e., fertile field mud) are mixed evenly, loaded into sand jars, and placed in a furnace or cooking stove to melt into molten iron. This method of smelting iron is easy to understand, and it only takes 24 hours from building the furnace to producing iron. At the same time, after the fire is lit and before the air is blown, there is a gap of three to four hours, which can be left unattended, and farmers can use this time to engage in agriculture or do housework. Cadres and the masses in the Jiangjin Special District have further simplified this method, using household cooking coal stoves, using natural wind power, without bellows, and heating for one and a half to two hours, the ore in the jar melts into molten iron. In this way, housewives and cooks can combine cooking and winter stove heating to smelt iron.

In terms of steel-making methods, in addition to using ore directly to make steel in counties such as Huidong in Sichuan, as well as the commonly used indigenous methods, Chongqing is vigorously promoting a method of "straw mud packaging and stewing steel." This method of steel-making does not require crucibles or sand pots. Only use straw to wrap the raw iron or wrought iron with the ingredients, apply a coating of soaked mud, and put it into the furnace. After smelting for a certain period of time, insert an iron bar into the package to check the color of the melted steel, and then remove the coal to produce steel. Using this method to make steel does not require coke, and the output is large. The output of a crucible furnace that melts 20 kilograms of steel can reach 500 kilograms. Many units in Chongqing have adopted the water immersion method to produce low-carbon steel and medium-carbon steel. This immersion steel smelting method was successfully tested by teachers and students of Chongqing No. 12 Middle School and residents of Qixinggang Street. The teachers and students of No. 12 Middle School used three *jin* of hematite, three *jin* of limestone, one *jin* of salt, and three *liang* of soda ash, ground into a powder, mixed with 10 to 15 *jin* of water, and stirred into a solution as a medicine for immersing steel. Then put the red-hot raw iron into the medicine water to immerse it, each time for two or three minutes, and repeat the immersion two or three times to make steel. Many cooks use this method to make steel while cooking.

The above-mentioned indigenous methods with a relatively large mass base, fighting alongside indigenous blast furnaces, small converters, electric furnaces, and crucible furnaces, have become an auxiliary force that cannot be ignored. Vigorously promoting diverse smelting methods is not only meaningful for fully mobilizing the masses and rapidly increasing steel production, but it will also have a huge impact on the development of the entire metallurgical industry.

### 千万群众皆尧舜　土法冶炼创造多  四川钢铁战线百花齐放

    千万群众皆尧舜　土法冶炼创造多
    四川钢铁战线百花齐放
    本报重庆26日电　小土群的方针激发了千百万人的创造性，四川钢铁战线上出现了百花齐放、多种多样冶炼方法同时媲美的活跃局面。
    为了进一步从多方面调动广大干部、群众的积极性，中共四川省委和许多地区的党委都十分重视各地根据当地条件和传统经验推行的许多好的冶炼方法。中共四川省委负责同志亲自办（试验炉），并召开现场会议，认真总结、推广泸州专区干部、群众创造的“炒回锅肉”的炼铁方法。这种方法，是把炼铁分为两步，先将矿石炼成烧结铁，然后再把烧结铁、焦炭和石灰石放在土高炉或各种能熔铁的炉子中熔成铁水。由于分两步进行，每一道熔炼所需要的热量不像土高炉直接从矿石炼制生铁那样需要的热量大，所以风量、风压容易掌握，操作很简便。各地原有的砖瓦窑、石灰窑、土陶窑、木炭窑、普通饭灶都可以炼出烧结铁。将烧结铁变成生铁，除了土高炉外，还可用汽油桶改制成小炼铁炉，只要一人鼓风，一人添料去渣就行了。这样，每社、每家每户都可以炼。四川叙永、綦江等县用这种方法，比土高炉直接把矿石熔成生铁产量提高50％到一倍以上。四川叙永县人民最近试验成功的一种罐罐炼铁的方法，在农村推广也十分便利。这种炼铁法采取原始炼铁和坩锅炼钢的原理综合而成，把焙烧的矿石、石灰石、白煤粉、淘泥粉（即肥田泥）和匀，装进砂罐，放在炉内或饭灶内熔成铁水。这种炼铁的方法一看就懂，从建炉到出铁只要二十四小时；同时在生火以后，鼓风以前，有三至四小时的间隙时间，可以不用人管，农民可以利用这段时间搞农业或做家里事。江津专区的干部、群众把这种方法进一步简化，采用家庭做饭的煤灶、利用自然风力、不用风箱，加热一小时半到两小时，罐内矿石就熔为铁水。这样，家庭妇女、炊事员结合煮饭和冬季烧炉烤火都可以炼。
    在炼钢方法上，四川除了会东县等地用矿石直接炼钢以及一般常见的土办法外，在重庆正大力推行一种“草泥包装焖钢”的方法。这种炼钢方法不用坩锅、砂锅，只用稻草把配上料的生铁或熟铁包扎起来，外涂泡石泥浆后放入炉内，冶炼一定时间，用铁条插入包内，察看已经熔化成的色，就将煤退掉出钢。用这种方法炼钢可以不用焦炭，而且产量大。一座熔钢二十公斤的坩锅炉，炉产量可以达到五百公斤。重庆市许多单位采取水浸的办法，炼出了低炭钢、中炭钢。这种浸钢的冶炼方法，是重庆第十二中学的师生和七星岗的街道居民试验成功的。第十二中学的师生用赤铁矿三斤（市斤）、石灰石三斤，食盐一斤、纯碱三两，磨成粉末，掺入十至十五斤水，搅拌成溶液，作为浸钢的药料，然后将烧红的生铁放进药水里浸，每次两、三分钟，反复浸两、三次即成钢。许多炊事员采用这种办法，一边做饭，一边炼钢。
    以上这些群众性较大的土办法，与土高炉、小转炉、电炉和坩锅炉等并肩作战，已成为一支不可忽视的辅助力量。大力提倡多种多样的冶炼方法，不仅对充分发动群众，迅速增加钢铁的产量有意义，而且对于整个冶金工业的发展也将发生巨大的影响。
