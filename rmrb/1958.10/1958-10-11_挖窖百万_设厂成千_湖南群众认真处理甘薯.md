Digging Millions of Cellars, Establishing Thousands of Factories
Hunan Masses Seriously Handle Sweet Potatoes

(Our Newspaper Despatch) Reporter Hu Jian reports: The sweet potato harvesting season is approaching, and Hunan Province has already arranged outlets for the fresh potatoes. Currently, over one million new potato cellars have been dug throughout the province, capable of storing over 15 billion jin of fresh potatoes. As of the end of September, the province has manufactured over 61,000 various sweet potato processing machines and established over 17,000 new small-scale potato processing factories, such as starch factories and wineries. A mass movement of "comprehensive utilization, processing sweet potatoes in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way" is underway throughout the province.

This year, the sweet potato planting area in the province is over 10 million mu, an increase of 60% compared to last year. Based on current trial harvesting estimates, the average yield per mu is around 10,000 jin. It is estimated that the total sweet potato output in the province this year will reach 80 billion jin, an increase of more than ten times compared to last year. According to preliminary calculations, the fresh potatoes needed for seeds and consumption by farmers throughout the province are only 30 billion jin, leaving approximately 50 billion jin to be processed. The relevant departments' processing plan is as follows: first, process the 50 billion jin of fresh potatoes into 3 million tons of starch; then, use the potato residue to refine 500,000 tons of alcohol, process 200,000 tons of maltose, and the remaining residue can be used for winemaking and pig feed. This year's sweet potato harvest not only provides ample feed for pigs, but the output value of sweet potato processing is estimated to increase the income of farmers throughout the province by more than 2 billion yuan.

However, both edible and processed fresh potatoes need storage space. The existing potato cellars in the province can only store 5 billion jin of fresh potatoes. Therefore, the province needs to dig 3 million to 4 million new potato cellars to ensure that two-thirds of the fresh potatoes are stored in cellars to prevent spoilage. It is estimated that processing 80 billion jin of sweet potatoes will require approximately 300 million labor days, meaning that the province will need to allocate one-fifth of its labor force (approximately 2.69 million people) and work hard for four months to complete the task. In early September, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions on "welcoming the sweet potato harvest and doing a good job in sweet potato processing," requiring Party committees at all levels to strengthen specific leadership, all departments to cooperate fully, prepare processing equipment early, and arrange labor properly to earnestly carry out sweet potato processing. Currently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and local Party committees and county committees have established sweet potato processing leading groups, designating specific personnel to lead this work. From the province to the people's communes, sweet potato processing plans have been formulated at each level and action is being taken in accordance with these plans.

On September 26, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial sweet potato processing work conference to review the preparatory work for sweet potato processing in the previous stage and to widely exchange experiences in comprehensive utilization and the use of indigenous, small-scale, and mass methods for processing sweet potatoes. Farmers in Yizhang County adopted the method of open-air storage of fresh potatoes using "turf ash piles," which is both simple and effective. Chetou Agricultural Cooperative in Dao County used deep plowing plows to dig sweet potatoes, with one person and one cow digging more than six mu per day, increasing work efficiency by eleven times compared to manual digging. In mid-September, Hengyang Prefecture held an on-site meeting to promote the use of deep plowing plows for digging sweet potatoes. After the promotion of this method throughout the region, it is estimated that 20 million laborers can be saved, greatly alleviating the labor shortage.

### 挖窖百万　设厂成千  湖南群众认真处理甘薯

    挖窖百万　设厂成千
    湖南群众认真处理甘薯
    本报讯　记者胡坚报道：挖红薯的季节快到了，湖南省已为鲜薯安排好出路。目前，全省新挖好的薯窖有一百多万个，能贮藏鲜薯一百五十多亿斤。到9月底止，全省已制造各种甘薯加工机具六万一千多部，新办淀粉厂、酿酒厂等小型薯类加工厂一万七千多个。一个“综合利用、多快好省地处理甘薯”的群众运动正在全省开展。
    今年全省甘薯种植面积有一千多万亩，比去年增加60％。从目前试收折算，一般亩产万斤左右。估计今年全省甘薯总产量可达八百亿斤，比去年增产十倍以上。据初步计算，全省农民留种和吃用的鲜薯只需要三百亿斤，约有五百亿斤需要加工处理。有关部门的处理规划是：将五百亿斤鲜薯首先加工成淀粉三百万吨；然后以薯渣炼出酒精五十万吨，加工饴糖二十万吨，剩下的薯渣还可以酿酒、喂猪。今年红薯丰收，不仅给生猪提供了充足的饲料，而且甘薯加工的产值估计能给全省农民增加二十多亿元收入。
    但是食用和加工的鲜薯都需要有贮藏的地方。而全省原有的薯窖只能贮藏五十亿斤鲜薯。因此全省需要新挖三百万个到四百万个薯窖，保证三分之二的鲜薯窖藏，才不至发生霉烂。预计全省处理八百亿斤甘薯，约需三亿个劳动日，即全省拿出五分之一的劳力（约二百六十九万人），需要苦战四个月才能完成。9月初，中共湖南省委发出“关于迎接甘薯丰收，做好甘薯处理工作”的指示，要求各级党委加强具体领导，各部门通力合作，及早准备加工设备和妥善安排劳力，认真做好甘薯处理工作。目前，中共湖南省委和各地委、县委都成立了甘薯处理领导小组，指定专人领导这一工作。从省到人民公社都逐级作出甘薯处理规划，并按照规划行动起来。
    9月26日，中共湖南省委召开的全省甘薯处理工作会议，对前段甘薯处理准备工作进行了检查，并广泛地交流了各地综合利用和采用土、小、群办法处理甘薯的经验。宜章县农民采用“草皮灰堆”露天保管鲜薯的办法，既简便，收效又好。道县车头农业社用深耕犁挖甘薯，一人一牛每天挖六亩多，比人工挖薯提高工效十一倍。衡阳专区9月中旬召开了现场会议，推广用深耕犁挖甘薯。全区推广这种办法后，估计可节省两千万个劳动力，大大缓和了劳力不足的状况。
