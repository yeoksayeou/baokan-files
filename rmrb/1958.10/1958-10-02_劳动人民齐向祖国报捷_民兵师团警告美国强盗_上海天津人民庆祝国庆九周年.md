Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 1st: The people of Shanghai today celebrated the 9th anniversary of National Day with grand parades and practical actions to step up production, in response to the military provocations of American imperialism.

At 8:00 AM, a celebration rally was held in People's Square. Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the rally. He called on the people of the city to always maintain their drive and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production plan and various leap forward targets.

A total of 500,000 people participated in the parade today. At 8:15 AM, the 200,000-strong parade team in the city center set off from People's Square in a mighty procession. At the forefront were the teams of heroic steel warriors, carrying huge steel ingot models and hundreds of production charts to report their achievements to the motherland. Shanghai's steel production has been rising in a straight line this year, with the output in the first nine months approaching the level of the entire last year. Since the beginning of this year, workers have repeatedly set 227 new steelmaking records. On September 30th, they released another large "satellite" as a gift to National Day, with a daily output of 4,463 tons, 120.8% higher than the average daily output of the previous 29 days of the month. Charts in the parade showed the determination of steelworkers throughout the city: to increase this year's steel output to 1.2 million tons, reaching two and a half times last year's output.

The farmers in the Shanghai suburbs, who all realized communization before National Day, participated in the parade today carrying abundant rice, cotton, and vegetables. Currently, one million suburban farmers are carrying out a large-scale production campaign, preparing to fight through the winter and spring to strive for even greater harvests next year.

After the people of Shanghai heard about the crime of the Chiang Kai-shek group, under the direction of American imperialism, using missiles to attack our air force, they became even more indignant. The parade was filled with an atmosphere of shared hatred for the enemy. People held up letters of determination, letters of protest, cartoons, and placards, determined to contribute the greatest strength to liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands.

"Turn National Day into a production increase day, turn holidays into battle days." At the automatic request of the masses, all factories in Shanghai continued to produce today, farmers continued to work in the fields, government offices continued to operate, and actors from various art troupes also went to factories and the countryside to perform for the workers and peasants. Many factories reported new production successes. The Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory completed the production of a 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator one month ahead of schedule today.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 1st: Today, 100,000 people in Tianjin paraded to report good news to the Party and Chairman Mao on the production front, using practical actions to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinmen and Mazu, liberating Taiwan, and opposing American imperialist aggression.

In the massive workers' contingent, the steelworkers marched at the forefront. This year, the steel brigade was very different from previous years. Under a sea of red flags, workers held up placards reading "Fight for Steel" and "Drown American Bandits with Steel," and thousands of steelworkers surged forward, surrounded by a huge model of a steel ladle pouring molten steel and a giant dragon model. On the giant dragon, a steelworker held up a huge steel ingot with the words "500,000 tons of steel" written on it. In order to get 500,000 tons of steel, the steelworkers guarded the furnace during meals and slept beside it. Their slogan was: "Fight the sun by day, fight the stars by night, steel production increases every day." Today, they are reporting their first outstanding victory to the people of the city. The daily steel production of the Tianjin Steel Plant and the Emerging Steel Plant has reached an unprecedented record of 1,099 tons. In the worker contingents of the machinery industry, the electric power industry, the railway, and capital construction, there were also huge placards everywhere that read "Be a Good Pioneer, Ensure the Ascension of the Steel Marshal."

The cultural and educational teams participated in the parade this year with a new look. The huge placard "Education Serves the Proletariat, Education Combines with Production" shows that the Party's education policy has taken root in the schools of Tianjin. Charts in the parade told people that more than 3,000 factories have now been set up in large, medium, and small schools throughout the city, and more than 98% of college and middle school students have participated in work-study programs. The products produced by Tianjin University and Nankai University alone include 1,357 types that exceed international standards.

This year, newly formed militia teams also appeared in the parade. Workers, students, farmers, and government cadres, already armed, tightly grasped the guns in their hands. Each person, full of vigor, participated in the parade review. Several thousand university students formed the East Wind Division, the Steel Division, and the Red Flag Division. Government cadres formed the Red Star Division, and workers and farmers formed the militia divisions and regiments, marching heroically and confidently under the guidance of the large placard "We Must Liberate Taiwan" to accept the review.

They represent more than ten million militiamen in Hebei who have rich combat experience and heroic traditions. Here is shown the unwavering will to resolutely strike at the aggressors. If imperialism dares to invade, we will make it impossible for them to move an inch.

    上海天津人民庆祝国庆九周年
    据新华社上海1日电　上海人民今天以盛大的游行和加紧生产的实际行动，庆祝国庆九周年，回击美帝国主义的军事挑衅。
    上午八时，在人民广场上举行了庆祝大会。中共中央政治局委员、中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施在会上讲话。他号召全市人民永远鼓足干劲，保证完成和超额完成今年的生产计划和各项跃进指标。
    今天参加游行的共有五十万人。八时十五分，市中心二十万人组成的游行队伍，浩浩荡荡地从人民广场出发。走在最前面的是英雄的钢铁战士的队伍，他们抬着巨大的钢包模型和数以百计的生产图表向祖国报捷。上海今年的钢产量直线上升，九个月的产量已经接近去年全年的水平。工人们今年以来连创了二百二十七次炼钢新纪录。9月30日他们又放出向国庆节献礼的大“卫星”，日产量达到四千四百六十三吨，比这个月前二十九天的平均日产量高出120.8％。游行队伍中一幅幅图表表明了全市钢铁工人的决心：一定要把今年的钢产量提高到一百二十万吨，达到去年产量的两倍半。
    国庆前夕全部实现人民公社化的上海郊区农民，今天带着丰产的水稻、棉花和蔬菜参加游行。目前一百万郊区农民正在开展大生产运动，准备再战一冬一春，争取明年更大的丰收。
    上海人民听到蒋介石集团在美帝国主义指使下，使用导弹进攻我国空军的罪行以后，更加怒不可遏。游行队伍充满了敌忾同仇的气氛，人们高举着决心书、抗议书、漫画和标语牌，决心为解放台湾和沿海岛屿贡献最大的力量。
    “把国庆节变为增产节，把休假日变为战斗日”，在群众的自动要求下，上海今天全市工厂照常生产，农民照常下田，机关照常办公，各文艺团体的演员也下厂下乡进行慰问演出。许多工厂传出了新的生产捷报。上海电机厂今天提前一个月制成了两万五千瓩汽轮发电机。
    据新华社天津1日电　今天，天津市十万人游行，在生产战线上向党、向毛主席报喜，用实际行动支援中国人民解放军解放金门、马祖，解放台湾，反对美帝国主义侵略。
    在浩大的工人队伍里，钢铁工人走在最前面。今年，钢铁大队比往年大不相同。在一片红旗招展下，工人们高举着“为钢而战”、“用钢淹没美国强盗”的标语牌，成千的钢铁工人，簇拥着一个倾吐着滚滚钢水的巨大钢水包模型和一条巨龙模型汹涌前进。在巨龙的身上，一个钢铁工人用双手举着巨大的钢锭，上面写着“五十万吨钢”的大字。炼钢工人们为了拿到五十万吨钢，守炉餐，伴炉眠，他们的口号是：“日战太阳，夜战星，钢铁产量日日增”，今天，他们带着第一个显赫的胜利向全市人民报喜。天津钢厂和新兴钢厂的日产钢，已经达到一千零九十九吨的历史上从未有过的纪录。在机械工业、电业、铁路、基建等工人队伍里，也到处是“当好先行官，确保钢铁元帅升帐”的巨幅标语牌。
    文教队伍今年以新的姿态参加了游行。“教育为无产阶级服务，教育与生产相结合”的巨幅标语牌，表示着党的教育方针在天津市的学校里已深入人心，游行队伍里的图表告诉人们：现在全市大中小学校已经办起了三千多个工厂，有98％以上的大中学生参加了勤工俭学，光是天津大学和南开大学生产的产品中，就有一千三百五十七种超过国际水平。
    今年游行行列里，还出现了刚刚组成的各种民兵队伍。已经武装起来的工人、学生、农民和机关干部们，紧握手中枪，一个个精神抖擞的参加了游行检阅，有几千名大学生组成东风师、钢铁师、红旗师，有机关干部组成的红星师，有工人、农民组成的民兵师团，在“一定要解放台湾”的大标语牌的引导下，雄赳赳地荷枪正步接受检阅。
    他们代表着河北一千多万有丰富战斗经验和英勇传统的民兵，这里显示出坚决打击侵略者不可摇撼的意志，帝国主义胆敢侵略，就要他寸步难行。
