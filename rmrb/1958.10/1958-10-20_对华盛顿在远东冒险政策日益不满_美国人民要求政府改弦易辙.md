Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Where will the US government's "brink of war" policy in the Taiwan Strait lead America? This is the question of greatest concern to the broad masses of the American people today. They express their indignation at the government's policy of crudely interfering in China's internal affairs, and are deeply disturbed by the serious and dangerous consequences that this policy will cause. Therefore, they are strengthening their struggle and demanding that the government change its policies of creating war and threatening peace.
    
In the current struggle of the American people against the government's aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs, their faithful defender of their interests, the Communist Party of the United States, stands at the forefront of the struggle. At the end of September, when the Communist Party of the United States celebrated its 39th anniversary, it issued a resounding call to the American people: demanding that "American troops withdraw from Chinese territory" and "stop American aggression against the People's Republic of China." The Communist Party passed a resolution demanding that American troops withdraw from Taiwan and the coastal areas of China, and withdraw from the western Pacific region.

The New York State Communist Party organization issued a campaign platform in early October regarding the Congressional elections this November, calling on the American people to rise up against the US government's disastrous war-mongering policies.

The Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, Dennis, called for launching a mass crusade against aggressive war in every local council, every congressional district, every workshop and trade union, every peace, church and social group to stop the US government's adventures in the Far East.
    
The attitude of the Communist Party of the United States reflects the sentiments and will of the broad masses of the people. The "Worker's Weekly" on the 12th published a telegram from Aurora, Illinois Mayor Egan to Eisenhower, pointing out that "the American people and the people of the world do not want another world war... They will not support a slaughter aimed at providing huge contracts for (capitalist) factories and obtaining huge profits and power for bankers."
    
The broad masses of the American people have written letters to newspapers, members of Congress, and the government, demanding a change in America's war-mongering policies and a reconsideration of its attitude toward China. The Denver "Post" published a letter from a reader named Gray saying, "If our brink-of-war antics lead to an open military conflict between the United States and China, then our policy will undoubtedly be justly regarded as the greatest mistake in history."
    
The "Baltimore Sun" published a letter from Thomas saying that Dulles' policies do not conform to the interests of the American people and are not supported by the American people. Thomas said that Dulles "threatens to drag us into war for Jinmen Island and send our sons to die for Chiang Kai-shek." The American people not only have the right but also should express their opinions.

In the many letters from the people received by members of Congress and the US government, the vast majority opposed the government's war provocation policies against China. In the five thousand letters received by the State Department, more than 80% expressed this view. The revelation of this news once caused confusion and unease within the US government.
    
Although the right-wing leadership of the largest trade union federation in the United States, the "AFL-CIO," has so far remained silent on the government's policies, many trade union organizations and workers have strongly expressed their opposition to the government's adventurous policies. The transportation workers' union newspaper "The T-Up Express" published an article by union president Kool, pointing out that Secretary of State Dulles is primarily responsible for the conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Kool emphasized, "Dulles is always crossing from one national border to another, from one abyss edge to another abyss edge." Kool called on the union's local branches to send delegations to members of Congress to protest the government's Far East policy.
    
Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union President Greenberg also lashed out at the US government's military provocations against the People's Republic of China in a speech. He called on union members to oppose any action in the Taiwan Strait that "only requires the sacrifice of one of our youths' lives."
    
The black people of America have also issued their strong voices in this struggle. The black newspaper "Chicago Defender" asked: "How long are we going to remain silent? Our government is recklessly dragging us from one cliff to another... How long will this insane action continue? Now is the time for the American people to demand an end to this irresponsible attitude and propose some reasonable alternative."
    
The black weekly "Pittsburgh Courier" published a commentary by columnist Burtis saying: "The President's policy on Taiwan does not satisfy me. I think we should withdraw from Taiwan and the Penghu Islands."

    对华盛顿在远东冒险政策日益不满
    美国人民要求政府改弦易辙
    新华社19日讯　美国政府在台湾海峡的“战争边缘政策”将把美国导向何处去？这是美国广大人民今天最为关心的一个问题。他们对政府粗暴干涉中国内政的政策表示愤慨，并且对这一政策将会引起的严重危险后果深为不安。因此，他们正在加强斗争，要求政府改变它的制造战争和威胁和平的政策。
    在美国人民当前反对政府侵略中国和干涉中国内政的斗争中，他们的利益的忠实捍卫者——美国共产党站在斗争的最前列。9月底美国共产党庆祝建党三十九周年时向美国人民发出了响亮的号召：要求“美国军队撤出中国领土”、“停止美国对中华人民共和国的侵略”。共产党通过决议，要求美国军队撤离台湾和中国沿海地区，撤离西太平洋地区。
    纽约州共产党组织在10月初发表了关于今年11月国会选举的竞选纲领。号召美国人民起来反对美国政府的灾难性的战争冒险政策。
    美国共产党书记丹尼斯呼吁在每一个地方议会、每一个国会选区、每一个车间和工会、每一个和平、教会和社会团体发动反对侵略战争的群众十字军，制止美国政府在远东的冒险。
    美国共产党的态度反映了广大人民的情绪和意志。12日的“工人周报”刊载伊利诺斯州奥罗拉市市长艾根在给艾森豪威尔的一封电报中指出，“美国人民和世界人民都不希望爆发另一次大战……他们不会支持目的在于为（资本家的）工厂提供巨额合同、为银行家们获得丰厚利润和权力而发动的屠杀。”
    美国广大人民纷纷写信给报纸、国会议员和政府要求改变美国的战争冒险政策，并且重新考虑对中国的态度。丹佛“邮报”刊载读者格雷的一封来信说，“如果我们的战争边缘把戏导致中美之间的公开的军事冲突，那么我们的政策无疑将被公正地认为是历史上最大的错误”。
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”发表了托马斯的来信说，杜勒斯的政策不符合美国人民的利益，得不到美国人民的支持。托马斯说，杜勒斯“扬言要为了金门岛把我们卷入战争，要为了蒋介石把我们的儿子派去送死”。美国人民不仅有权而且应当表示自己的意见。
    在国会议员和美国政府所收到的许多人民来信中，绝大多数都反对政府对中国的战争挑衅政策。在国务院收到的五千封来信中，80％以上表示了这种意见。这个消息的透露在美国政府内部一度引起混乱和不安。
    尽管美国最大的工会联合会“劳联—产联”的右翼领导机构至今还对政府的政策保持缄默。但是，许多工会组织和工人还是强烈地表示反对政府冒险的政策。运输业工人工会机关报“图尤快报”刊登工会主席库耳的一篇文章指出，国务卿杜勒斯应对台湾海峡地区的冲突负主要责任。库耳着重指出，“杜勒斯老是从这个国界跨到另一个国界，从这个深渊边缘跨到另一个深渊边缘”。库耳号召这个工会各地方分会派遣代表团到国会议员那里去，抗议政府的远东政策。
    零售、批发、百货公司工人工会主席格林堡在一次演说中也猛烈抨击了美国政府对中华人民共和国的军事挑衅。他号召工会会员反对在台湾海峡采取那怕“只需要付出我们一个青年的生命”的行动。
    美国的黑人在这一斗争中也发出了他们的强烈呼声。黑人日报“芝加哥保卫者报”问道：“我们还要沉默多久？我们的政府轻率地把我们从一个悬崖拖向另一个悬崖……他们这种疯狂的行动要继续多久呢？现在是美国人民要求中止这种不负责任的态度并且提出某种合理的代替办法的时候了”。
    黑人的周刊“匹兹堡新闻报”刊载专栏作家柏蒂斯的一篇评论说：“总统关于台湾的政策并不使我满意。我认为我们应当退出台湾和澎湖列岛”。
