Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – News: The Japan Socialist Party held an emergency meeting of its Central Executive Committee this afternoon. The meeting decided on a plan to strengthen the struggle against the reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government. The plan stipulates that the struggle, which until now has been to demand that the government change its policies, will be transformed into a struggle to “overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet” and “submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet.”

The meeting believes that the Kishi Nobusuke government is attempting to revise the “Police Duties Execution Law,” once again turning Japan into a police state. Moreover, judging from the remarks made by Kishi Nobusuke when he met with a reporter from NBC, and from Kishi Nobusuke's replies to the inquiries made by Socialist Party members Narita Tomomi and Okada Muneyoshi regarding the aforementioned issue, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's intention to delete the clause in the constitution that renounces war, and to revise the constitution in order to dispatch troops abroad, is becoming increasingly clear. Furthermore, Kishi Nobusuke has slandered China as an "aggressor" and is attempting to form an anti-communist alliance between Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek, which has greatly shocked Asian countries. Therefore, the meeting believes that the conditions for overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet have rapidly increased.

The meeting also decided to use discussions in plenary sessions and committee meetings of the Diet to explain to the Japanese people that the "amendment" is a copy of the pre-war "Public Order Police Law" and "Administrative Execution Law," and that it will once again turn Japan into a police state; at the same time, it will thoroughly expose the essence of this "amendment" as trampling on human rights and violating the constitution.

The Japan Socialist Party has already submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives today demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government withdraw the "Police Duties Execution Law Amendment Bill."

The emergency meeting also decided to strengthen the struggle outside the Diet. It was decided that Kato, chairman of the Special Committee for the Protection of the Constitution, would be the head of the action group for the struggle outside the Diet. With the action group as the core, it will contact the National Conference Against the Revision of the Police Duties Execution Law and launch a struggle to unite the struggle inside and outside the Diet.

    日本社会党确定行动方针
    决定加强斗争打倒岸内阁
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午举行了中央执行委员会紧急会议，会议决定了加强反对岸信介政府反动政策的斗争方针。方针规定把直到目前所进行的要求政府改变政策的斗争改变为“打倒岸信介内阁”、“提出不信任内阁决议案”的斗争。
    会议认为，岸信介政府企图修改“警察官职务执行法”，再一次把日本变成警察国家。而且，从岸信介接见美国全国广播公司记者时发表的谈话和岸信介对社会党议员成田知已和冈田宗司关于上述问题的质询所作的答复来看，岸信介内阁要删除宪法中放弃战争的条款；修改宪法，以便派兵出国的企图越来越清楚了。而且，岸信介还诬蔑中国是“侵略国”，并且企图结成日本、李承晚、蒋介石反共同盟，使亚洲各国受到很大的震动。因此，会议认为，打倒岸信介内阁的条件已经迅速地增加了。
    会议还决定要通过在国会的全体会议和委员会会议上进行的讨论，向日本人民说明：“修正案”是战前的“治安警察法”和“行政执行法”的翻版，它将重新使日本变成一个警察国家；同时还要彻底揭露这个“修正案”蹂躏人权和违反宪法的实质。
    日本社会党已经在今天向众议院提出了要求岸信介政府撤回“警察官职务执行法修正案”提案。
    紧急会议还决定要加强国会外的斗争。决定以拥护宪法特别委员会委员长加藤为国会外斗争干事团团长，以干事团为核心，同反对警察官职务执行法国民会议取得联系，展开斗争，把国会内外的斗争统一起来。
