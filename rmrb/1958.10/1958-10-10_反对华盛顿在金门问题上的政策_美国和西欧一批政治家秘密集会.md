Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th -- According to TASS, prominent American commentator Marquis Childs said in an article published in the "New York Post" that a number of prominent politicians from the United States and Western Europe held a secret meeting expressing "opposition to the United States' policy on the Quemoy issue."

The author stated that for several years, "a group of Europeans and Americans in high positions have regularly held private meetings to exchange views on international issues. This group does not include government ministers, but it does include former ministers and some who may lead governments in the future." From September 13th to 15th, this group met again in Ditchley Park, England. The American attendees included former Secretary of State Acheson, as well as former High Commissioner for Germany and Chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, McCloy, who has close ties to the Eisenhower administration.

Childs wrote that on the first day of the Ditchley Park meeting, a special collection on the question of policy toward China was distributed, which sharply raised the question of the impact of Washington's policy on China's coastal islands on the situation in the Far East and Europe. According to the materials received, Acheson severely criticized the Eisenhower-Dulles policy at the meeting. McCloy also said that he had few differences with Acheson. Childs also said, "Almost all Europeans, without exception, attacked the rigid attitude of the United States on the coastal islands issue." The author pointed out, "This is doubly important because most of the attendees are conservative figures. Among them are bankers and industrialists: West German industrialist Abs and the Vice Chairman of the Italian 'Fiat' car company, Agnelli. Reitz, the General Representative of the Krupp Concern, also attended."

In addition, this group also included "Liberals and Socialists," including British Labour Party leader Gaitskell. After discussing the political background of this group, Childs said, "It is worth noting that regardless of the political attitudes of these people, their opinions (on American policy) are consistent." Childs said that McCloy has returned to the United States and has informed U.S. Secretary of State Dulles of this group's opposition to the U.S. policy on the Quemoy issue.

    反对华盛顿在金门问题上的政策
    美国和西欧一批政治家秘密集会
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：美国著名评论员蔡尔兹在“纽约邮报”发表的一篇文章说，美国和西欧的一些著名政治家秘密集会，表示“反对美国在金门问题上的政策”。
    作者说，若干年来，“一批身居要职的欧洲人和美国人定期举行私人集会，来就国际问题交换意见。这一批人不包括政府阁员，不过其中有过去的部长还有将来可能领导政府的一些人”。9月13日到15日，这一批人又在英国的培克斯顿会面了。参加会见的美国人士有前国务卿艾奇逊，还有前驻德国高级专员、曼哈顿大通银行董事长麦克洛埃，这个人同艾森豪威尔的政府关系很密切。
    蔡尔兹写道，在培克斯顿会议的第一天，散发了对华政策问题专集，这个专集尖锐地提出了华盛顿关于中国沿海岛屿的政策对远东和欧洲局势的影响。根据所得到的材料，艾奇逊在会上严厉地抨击艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯的政策。而麦克洛埃也说，他同艾奇逊很少有分歧的地方。蔡尔兹还说：“差不多所有欧洲人都毫无例外地抨击美国在沿海岛屿问题上的僵硬态度。”作者指出：“这一点加倍重要，因为集会者大部分是保守的人士。其中有银行家和工业家：西德大工业家阿布斯和意大利‘菲亚特汽车公司’副董事长安埃利。克虏伯康采恩的总代表拜茨也出席了。”
    此外，这一批人当中还有“自由党人和社会党人”，其中包括英国工党领袖盖茨克尔。蔡尔兹在谈到这批人的政治背景后说：“值得注意的是：不管这些人的政治态度如何，他们（对美国政策）的意见是一致的。”蔡尔兹说，麦克洛埃回美国后已经把这批人反对美国在金门问题上的政策的立场告诉了美国国务卿杜勒斯。
