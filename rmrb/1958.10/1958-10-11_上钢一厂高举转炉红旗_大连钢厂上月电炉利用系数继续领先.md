    Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 Holds High the Converter Red Flag
    Dalian Steel Plant's Electric Furnace Utilization Rate Continues to Lead Last Month
    (Our newspaper Shanghai, October 10th, report by reporter Gao Hao) The No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, which won the national high-yield converter steelmaking red flag in August, overcame the difficulties of poor raw materials and poor production conditions in September and continued to maintain a high level of production, reaching 91.38 tons of steel per nominal ton (designed tonnage) per day and night, an increase of 0.07 tons compared with August, and still leading the country.
    The amount of steel produced per nominal ton per day and night is also called the utilization rate of the steelmaking converter. Before July of this year, the average utilization rate of the converter in this workshop was only over 70. Starting in July, this workshop launched a mass movement, broke conservative ideas, and the utilization rate increased sharply to over 90. In the three months of July, August, and September, they produced 11,748 tons more steel than in the second quarter of this year, an increase in production of 22.9%.
    After August, the pig iron raw materials received by this plant had very low silicon content, and the quality of coke was also poor, and the iron-smelting furnace often froze, and the molten iron supply could not keep up. The workers tried to make the iron-smelting furnace "eat less and more frequently" and strengthened maintenance. At the same time, a furnace repair commando team was established to shorten the furnace repair time from the original two days to twenty hours.
    The workers have put forward new goals: in October, the entire workshop will produce 24,840 tons of steel, a further improvement compared to September.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, October 10th) The Dalian Steel Plant, which holds high the national high-yield electric furnace steelmaking red flag, achieved an electric furnace utilization rate of 36.970 in September. This record broke their own records of 28.337 and 28.593, which they had continuously created in the previous two months, and continued to lead among electric furnace steel plants nationwide.
    In September, the Dalian Steel Plant widely promoted the new "three gases" steelmaking technology of simultaneous use of electricity, oxygen, and gas, improved scrap steel processing, and implemented new measures such as shortening the melting period, deoxidizing outside the furnace, and eliminating the reduction period. At the same time, based on the experience of brother plants, a plant-wide communist large-scale collaboration was launched nationwide. The steel production of this plant in September increased by 28% compared with August. Now, the workers are holding high the red flag and continuing to move forward, determined to double steel production again in October.

    上钢一厂高举转炉红旗
    大连钢厂上月电炉利用系数继续领先
    本报上海10日电　记者高浩报道：在8月份获得全国转炉炼钢高产红旗称号的上钢一厂第一转炉车间，9月份战胜了原料差、生产条件坏的困难，继续保持了高产水平，达到每公称吨（设计吨位）一昼夜产钢九十一点三八吨，比8月份又提高零点零七吨，仍然在全国领先。
    每公称吨一昼夜的产钢量，又称炼钢转炉的利用系数。今年7月以前，这个车间转炉的利用系数平均还只有七十多。7月份开始，这个车间大搞群众运动，大破保守思想，利用系数猛增到九十以上。7、8、9三个月内比今年第二季度多出了一万一千七百四十八吨钢，产量增长22.9％。
    8月份以后，这个厂收到的生铁原料合矽很低，焦炭质量也差，化铁炉经常冻结，铁水供应不上。工人们设法使化铁炉“少吃多餐”，加强维护，同时成立修炉突击队，把修炉时间从原来二天缩短到二十小时。
    工人们已经提出新的目标：10月份全车间要生产二万四千八百四十吨钢，比9月份再提高一步。
    据新华社旅大10日电　高举全国电炉炼钢高产红旗的大连钢厂，9月份电炉利用系数达到了三六点九七零。这个纪录又刷新了他们自已上两个月连续创造的二八点三三七和二八点五九三的纪录，继续在全国电炉钢厂中领先。
    9月份，大连钢厂广泛推行了电气、氧气、煤气同时采用的“三气”炼钢新技术，改进废钢加工，实行了缩短熔化期、炉外脱氧、取消还原期等新措施，同时根据兄弟厂的经验，全国发动群众开展全厂性的共产主义大协作。这个厂9月份的钢产量比8月份提高了28％。现在，工人们高举红旗继续前进，决定在10月份把钢产量再翻一番。
