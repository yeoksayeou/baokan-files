Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The National Financial and Trade Work Conference in Xi'an victoriously concluded on the 23rd. The conference mainly discussed and resolved the following issues: how to improve the rural financial and trade system under the new situation of rural collectivization; how to seize the current procurement and sales work; and how to strengthen the Party's leadership over financial and trade work and implement the mass line.

The conference began on the 15th of this month. Attending the conference were Li Xiannian, Ma Mingfang, Cheng Zihua, Yao Yilin, and responsible comrades from relevant central departments, as well as Party secretaries and deputy secretaries in charge of financial and trade work from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and directors and chiefs of finance, grain, and commerce departments (bureaus).

Comrade Li Xiannian first made a detailed report on the above issues, and then group meetings were held in conjunction with plenary speeches for discussion, and solutions were proposed. The conference focused on studying the new problems and tasks brought to financial and trade work after the nationwide realization of people's communes, and the solutions to these problems. The conference believes that the universal establishment of people's communes has caused a series of new changes in production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. In terms of production relations, the last remnants of private ownership that existed during the agricultural cooperative period are being eliminated, and the components of ownership by the whole people are growing. The peasant masses describe this new change as: "A sharp knife cuts off private ownership, opening a new era in history." In terms of distribution, the method of distribution according to labor days is being changed to a semi-supply system and semi-wage system. Some places have now implemented a grain supply system, relieving the peasants of the psychological worry of food and drink that they have had for thousands of years, and inspiring the peasants' political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm. In terms of exchange, the part of self-production and self-use within the commune and direct distribution has expanded, and the part of commodity exchange has shrunk. For example, after the establishment of the people's commune, many product promotions and raw material supplies (mainly iron and wood industries), etc., basically no longer go through the commercial departments, and most of the products are produced and sold by the commune itself. Procurement and sales tasks are more concentrated. Agricultural products that used to be purchased separately from dozens of agricultural cooperatives are now purchased from one commune; non-staple foods and cooking utensils that used to be sold separately to thousands of households are now only sold to a few canteens. Moreover, the variety of goods supplied has also changed. For example, the supply of cooking utensils such as large pots and large steamers has increased significantly, while the supply of small pots and small steamers has greatly decreased. In terms of consumption, due to the widespread development of public welfare undertakings, the lives of farmers are more collective, and public consumption units such as canteens, sewing groups, nurseries, kindergartens, and "happiness homes" have replaced the narrow family units of the past. Therefore, daily necessities and non-staple foods are all sold in a unified and concentrated manner. These new situations will inevitably cause changes in the work tasks of commercial, financial, and banking institutions. For example, in the future, commercial departments will not only organize commodity exchange within the scope of the people's commune, but also organize the direct distribution of products, and support and promote the development of production through the organization of direct distribution of products and commodity exchange. As for financial work, the industrial and commercial tax system, which used to take commodity circulation as the tax collection link, is now incompatible with the production situation and commodity circulation situation of the commune. If it is not changed, some industrial and commercial taxes will not be collected. For example, the industrial and commercial tax of the Changping District People's Commune in Beijing has decreased by 57%. The original agricultural tax system is also no longer applicable due to the rapid development of agricultural production. Township finances have also changed because the people's commune is a combination of government and commune. Financial work after the establishment of the commune is for the whole people. It is responsible for both the accumulation of state funds and the accumulation and distribution tasks of the commune itself. In terms of banking work, the scope of bank transfer settlements has been further expanded, and cash transactions have been relatively reduced. For example, agricultural products sold by the people's commune can be settled through transfer settlements, without the need to pay a large amount of cash.

The conference believes that financial and trade work and all aspects of the people's commune are closely related. How financial and trade work adapts to the new situation of collectivization is an urgent problem to be solved. Otherwise, it will affect the consolidation and development of the people's commune, and also affect the great leap forward in production and the completion of various national plans. This conference focused on studying this issue and believes that the solution to the rural financial and trade system must be based on the spirit of centralized leadership and decentralized management, and implement the method of decentralizing institutions, unified planning, and fiscal contracting—that is, "two releases, three unifications, and one contract." "Two releases"—namely, releasing personnel and releasing funds. The grass-roots organizations of the state's financial and trade departments in rural areas, except for certain organizations that serve several communes or a larger area, are all decentralized, and personnel are treated as personnel of the commune, and assets are managed and used by the commune. From now on, these units are both part of the people's commune and the grass-roots units of the state's financial and trade departments. These institutions are mainly led by the people's commune and accept the business leadership of the higher-level financial and trade departments. "Three unifications"—namely, unified policies, unified plans, and unified management of working capital. The people's commune unconditionally implements the state's unified guidelines and policies and unified plans, and delivers state-procured products according to the state plan, and distributes state-marketed materials to members according to the state plan. The people's commune ensures that working capital is generally only used for the working capital needed for industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation, and must not be used for basic construction investment and other purposes. "One contract"—that is, contracting fiscal tasks. The state's agricultural tax, industrial and commercial tax, income from decentralized enterprises, income from undertakings, and local surcharges in rural areas are uniformly calculated, deducting the administrative expenses and operating expenses originally paid by the state, and the commune contracts to hand over the balance of revenue and expenditure. When stipulating the proportion and amount of the handover, the different circumstances of each region should be taken into account. In principle, richer areas should bear more than poorer areas, and cash crop areas should bear more than grain crop areas. The conference believes that the "two releases, three unifications, and one contract" method has many benefits. The main thing is that it can ensure the comprehensive implementation of state policies and plans, and it is conducive to the people's commune making comprehensive arrangements for industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs; it can guarantee the state's fiscal revenue and also help the people's commune fully develop its enthusiasm for developing production and increasing accumulation.

The conference believes that improving the financial and trade system is a new task. In order to do this work well, we must first do a good job in the ideological work of cadres. Educate cadres to correctly understand this new change. For example, some people are not very clear about whether decentralizing the state's grass-roots financial and trade institutions to the people's commune is a step backward from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership. Therefore, through debate, cadres should be educated to realize that the very fact of the transition from agricultural cooperatives to people's communes is a big step towards ownership by the whole people; moreover, the financial and trade institutions decentralized to the people's commune are both part of the commune and grass-roots units of the state's financial and trade departments. This actually increases the component of ownership by the whole people in the people's commune, strengthens the state's leadership over the people's commune, and makes it easier for the people's commune to transition to ownership by the whole people. For example, after the implementation of the new method, can the people's commune do a good job in financial and trade work and ensure the state's revenue? The conference believes that the people's commune is under the absolute leadership of the Party, based on the communist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, and based on the rapid development of productive forces as a material condition. In this way, it is entirely believable that financial and trade work can definitely be done well in the future, and the state's revenue can definitely be guaranteed. Grass-roots financial and trade cadres must also realize that it is their honor to become a member of a people's commune after being decentralized. Every cadre should welcome this change and promote this change.

The people's communes in various places have only been established recently, and the specific conditions and work progress of each region are also different. Therefore, the conference believes that the provinces, cities, and autonomous regions can formulate their own regulations on the time, steps, and specific methods for implementing this method according to local conditions. However, the following principles must be observed: it is conducive to the consolidation and improvement of the people's commune; it is conducive to the development of industrial and agricultural production, rationally taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual; the methods are simple and easy to implement, and the organizational levels should be reduced as much as possible.

Regarding the procurement and sales issues for this winter and next spring, the conference believes that due to the comprehensive bumper harvest of agricultural production, the procurement and sales tasks have increased a lot compared with previous years. Especially this winter and next spring, the task of purchasing agricultural and sideline products is large, and the time is very concentrated. At present, the procurement tasks in various regions have not been completed well enough. However, this kind of tension is fundamentally different from previous years. The tension in previous years was due to insufficient products, while this year it is a bumper harvest, with many products that cannot be purchased. In order to change this situation, it is required that Party committees at all levels pay attention to combining blitz purchases with regular purchases, and combining blitz transportation with regular transportation. While ensuring the completion of steel production and the "Three Autumns" work, they should reasonably arrange labor forces and organize urban labor forces to participate in the transportation work in procurement and sales, carry out a procurement and sales work campaign, adopt the method of large campaigns within small campaigns and long campaigns within short campaigns, not fearing all difficulties, drilling whenever there is a gap, sticking a needle whenever there is a seam, organizing labor, seizing time, and striving to complete the task.

The conference also discussed strengthening the Party's leadership over financial and trade work and implementing the mass line. The conference believes that some shortcomings and errors have also occurred in financial and trade work in the past. The main reason is that financial and trade institutions at all levels did not rely on the Party committee enough and did not implement the mass line enough. The key to doing a good job in financial and trade work in the future is to further rely on the Party committee, implement the mass line, and strengthen political and ideological work. To this end, the conference believes that in this period, we should first lay a good foundation for strengthening the Party's leadership. Party organizations in some commercial departments that are not sound in the past should be improved and the Party's leadership force should be strengthened. Only in this way can the Party's leadership over financial and trade work be further strengthened. The conference also believes that a red flag movement should be launched nationwide. Since the rectification campaign, some red flags have appeared in financial and trade departments, but this is far from enough. Under the new situation of the people's commune, a large-scale red flag movement should be launched immediately in financial and trade departments at all levels across the country. Through this movement, the white flags in financial and trade work should be pulled out, and the red flags of financial and trade work should be planted all over the country.

    适应农村新形势改进财贸体制
    全国财贸工作会议提出机构下放、计划统一、财政包干
    新华社西安26日电　全国财贸工作西安会议已于23日胜利闭幕。会议主要讨论和解决了以下问题：在农村公社化的新形势下，如何改进农村财贸体制问题；抓紧当前购销工作问题；加强对财贸工作党的领导和贯彻群众路线的问题等。
    这次会议是从本月15日开始的。出席会议的有李先念、马明方、程子华、姚依林和中央有关部门的负责同志，还有全国各省、市、自治区管理财贸工作的党委书记、副书记和财贸部长、财政、粮食、商业厅、
  （局）长等。
    会议首先由李先念同志就上述问题作了详细的报告，然后采取小组会的形式，结合大会发言进行讨论，并提出了解决的办法。会议着重研究了在全国实现人民公社化以后给财贸工作带来的新问题和新任务，以及解决这些问题的办法。会议认为人民公社的普遍建立引起生产、分配、交换和消费方面一系列的新的变化。在生产关系方面，农业合作化时期存在的私有制的最后残余正在消灭中，全民所有制的成分正在增长。农民群众形容这一新的变化说：“利刀斩去私有制，开辟历史新纪元”。在分配方面，正由过去的按劳动日分配的办法，改变为半供给制、半工资制。现在有的地方已经实行粮食供给制，解除了农民几千年来的愁吃愁喝的心理，鼓舞了农民的政治热情和生产热情。在交换方面，社内自产自用，直接分配的部分扩大了，商品交换的部分缩小了。例如在成立人民公社后，有很多产品推销，原料供应（主要是铁业、木业）等，基本上不再经过商业部门，大部分产品由公社自产自销。购销任务更加集中了，过去向几十个农业社分别收购的农产品，现在向一个公社去收购；过去向千百家农户分别出售的副食品和炊事用具等，现在只向少数食堂出售。而且供应的商品品种也起了变化，如炊事用具，大锅大蒸笼等的供应量大量地增加，而小锅、小蒸笼的供应量则大大减少。在消费方面，由于公共福利事业普遍发展，农民生活更加集体化了，公共消费单位如食堂、缝纫组、托儿所、幼儿园、幸福院等，代替了过去狭小的家庭单位。因此，日用品、副食品都统一集中出售。这些新的情况必然会引起商业、财政、银行等机构的工作任务的变化。例如今后的商业部门，在人民公社的范围内不仅要组织商品交换，而且要组织产品的直接分配，并通过组织产品的直接分配和商品交换，支援和促进生产的发展。又如在财政工作方面，过去以商品流通为征税环节的工商税收制度，现在已与公社生产的情况和商品流转的情况不相适应，如果不改变，有部分工商税就收不到了。如北京昌平区人民公社工商税减少57％。原来的农业税制度，由于农业生产的飞跃发展，也不适用了。乡财政由于人民公社是政社合一，因此也起了变化。公社建立后的财政工作是全民性的，它既负责国家资金的积累，又要负责公社本身的积累与分配任务。在银行工作上，通过银行转账结算的范围进一步扩大了，现金交易相对的减少了。例如人民公社出售的农业品，可以通过转账结算方式进行清算，不需要支付大量的现金。
    会议认为，财贸工作和人民公社的各个方面都有着极为密切的关系，财贸工作如何适应公社化的新形势，是急需解决的问题，不然，就会影响人民公社的巩固和发展，并且也影响着生产的大跃进和国家各项计划的完成。这次会议比较突出地研究了这个问题，认为解决农村财贸体制的办法，必须根据集中领导、分级管理的精神，实行机构下放，计划统一，财政包干的办法——即“两放、三统、一包”。“两放”——即放人员、放资金。国家在农村的财贸部门的基层机构，除了为几个公社或者更大范围服务的某些机构以外，全部下放，人员作为公社的人员，资产一律归公社管理使用。今后，这些单位既是人民公社的组成部分，又是国家财贸部门的基层单位。这些机构以受人民公社领导为主，并接受上级财贸部门的业务领导。“三统”——即统一政策、统一计划、统一流动资金的管理。人民公社无条件地执行国家的统一方针政策和统一计划，按照国家计划交售国家统购的产品，按照国家计划向社员配售国家统销物资。人民公社保证流动资金一般只用于工农业生产和商品流转所需要的流动资金方面，不得使用于基本建设投资及其它用途。“一包”——即包财政任务。把国家在农村中的农业税、工商税、下放企业收入、事业收入和地方附加等收入，统一计算，扣除原来由国家开支的行政费和事业费，由公社按收支差额，包干上交。在规定上交的比例和数额时，应照顾到各地区的不同情况。原则上富区比穷区多负担一些，经济作物区比粮食作物区多负担一些。会议认为“两放、三统、一包”办法的好处很多，主要是既可以保证国家政策和计划的全面贯彻，又有利于人民公社对工农商学兵作全面的安排；既可以保证国家的财政收入，又有利于人民公社充分发挥发展生产、增加积累的积极性。
    会议认为，改进财贸体制是一个新的工作，为了做好这一工作，必须首先做好干部的思想工作。教育干部正确地认识这一新的变革。例如把国家的基层财贸机构下放给人民公社，是不是全民所有制向集体所有制后退了一步的问题，有些人的思想上就不大明确。因此，应通过辩论，教育干部认识到由农业社到人民公社这一事实的本身就是向全民所有制迈进了一大步；而且下放给人民公社的财贸机构，一方面是公社的组成部分，同时又是国家财贸部门的基层单位。这实际上更增加了人民公社的全民所有制的成份，加强了国家对于人民公社的领导，更加便于人民公社向全民所有制过渡。又如实行新的办法后，人民公社能不能把财贸工作做好，能不能保证国家的收入？会议认为人民公社是在党的绝对领导之下的，是以广大农民群众的共产主义觉悟为思想基础的，是以生产力迅速发展为物质条件的。这样，完全可以相信，今后财贸工作一定可以做好，国家的收入一定可以得到保证。基层财贸干部也必须认识到自己下放后，成为一个人民公社的社员，是自己的光荣。每个干部应该欢迎这种变革，促进这种变革。
    各地的人民公社才建立不久，而且各个地区的具体情况和工作进度也有所不同，因此，会议认为，在实行这个办法的时间、步骤和具体方法上，各省、市、自治区可根据当地情况，自行规定。但是必须遵守这样一些原则：有利于人民公社的巩固和提高；有利于工农业生产的发展，合理兼顾国家、集体和个人的利益，办法简便宜行，机构层次力求减少。
    关于今冬明春的购销问题，会议认为由于农业生产全面大丰收，购销任务比往年增加了很多。尤其是今冬明春，农副产品收购任务大，时间又非常集中。目前各地区的收购任务完成得不够好。但是，这种紧张的性质和往年根本不同，往年的紧张是产品不足，今年是大丰收，产品多而收不上来。为了改变这种情况，要求各级党委注意把突击收购和经常收购结合起来，突击运输和经常运输结合起来，在保证完成钢铁生产和三秋工作的同时，合理地安排一下劳动力，并组织城市劳动力参加购销中的运输工作，搞一次购销工作的运动，采取大运动套小运动、长运动套短运动的办法，不怕一切困难，有空就钻，有缝就扎针，组织劳力，抢时间，努力完成任务。
    会议还讨论了加强党对财贸工作的领导和贯彻群众路线的问题。会议认为，过去财贸工作中也发生了一些缺点和错误，主要原因是各级财贸机构依靠党委不够，贯彻执行群众路线不够。今后做好财贸工作的关键，就是进一步依靠党委，贯彻群众路线，加强政治思想工作。为此，会议认为在这一时期，首先应该为加强党的领导打好基础，过去某些商业部门的党组织不健全的应健全起来，把党的领导力量充实起来，只有这样，才能进一步加强党对财贸工作的领导。会议还认为应该在全国范围内开展一个红旗运动。财贸部门经过整风以来，已经出现了一些红旗，但是这还非常不够，在人民公社的新形势下，在全国各级财贸部门中应立即开展一个大规模的红旗运动。要通过这次运动，拔掉财贸工作中的白旗，把财贸工作的红旗插遍全国。
