Water Transport Doubles
Commentator of this Newspaper

The Ministry of Transportation recently convened the National Waterborne Steel Transportation Great Leap Forward Conference in Wuhan, making the resolution to "Double Transport Volume and Be a Good Pioneer." This is a major measure to eliminate the current transportation bottlenecks and guarantee the production of 10.7 million tons of steel this year. We know that water transport occupies an important position in the entire transportation industry. The task of water transport is constantly growing. According to preliminary estimates, the national water transport volume in the fourth quarter will increase by more than double compared to the third quarter. Therefore, the urgent task currently facing China's water transport workers is to strive to more than double water transport capacity to meet the requirements of the situation.

Here, people will ask: Does China's water transport have such a huge potential? Our answer is affirmative.

Currently, the largest and most rapidly effective link in water transport potential is in ports. Ports are the decisive link in water transport. If the throughput capacity of ports can be fully utilized, with quick loading and unloading, cargo turnover can be accelerated, and thereby the transport capacity of ships can be fully utilized. Some people believe: "Port throughput capacity is determined by mechanical equipment, and China's port equipment is poor, so the port throughput capacity is limited." This view is obviously incorrect. Adding modern port machinery and equipment, especially loading and unloading equipment, is certainly an effective measure to increase port throughput capacity, and all ports with conditions can work towards this. But this does not mean that port throughput capacity cannot be improved without modern machinery and equipment. Recently, the Port of Shanghai, relying on the Party committee and the masses, has increased its daily throughput capacity by more than double by adopting the method of ants moving Mount Tai, eliminating port congestion. The Jianggan Wharf in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, also used indigenous methods to implement mechanization, which doubled loading and unloading efficiency. In addition, rationally organizing and using labor, strengthening port dispatching, closely organizing lighterage operations and direct operations between trucks and ships, and between ships, and fully utilizing the role of wharves and storage yards, so that inter-port operations are organically combined, can also improve port throughput capacity. It can be seen that the key to improving the throughput capacity of major ports at present lies in relying on the Party committee and the masses to tap the potential of existing equipment, storage yards, and port barges, rather than simply relying on increasing equipment and manpower.

Since there are many short-distance goods and small-port goods in current water transport, local transportation departments should pay special attention to adopting simple and rapid methods to build docks or pontoons, organize fixed loading and unloading workers, turn no-ports into ports, quickly gather and distribute cargo for ship transportation, and fully utilize the transportation efficiency of ships.

In order to double water transport, it is also necessary to vigorously tap the potential of existing ships. Ships are the main tools of water transport. The key to tapping the potential of ships lies first in maximizing horsepower and load capacity. Recently, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau have taken specific measures to increase horsepower by 34.5% and tonnage by 12.4%. It can be seen that the potential of existing ships is very large. In the current situation where modern ships are still extremely scarce, vigorously promoting towing and pushing transportation methods is also an effective way to increase water transport capacity. For example, in maritime transport, the method of cargo ships towing barges, using one ship for two purposes, has increased transport capacity by 26%. Hubei and other provinces have promoted rudderless pushing and mixed fleets of iron and wooden ships, which have increased load capacity by 50%-100%, and the speed can also be increased by 10%-15%. If we can vigorously improve operational organization, rationally allocate loads, implement advanced working methods of fixed ships, fixed routes, and fixed docks, and organize direct transport to the extent possible, reducing material transshipment, we can improve transport capacity. In addition, strengthening the maintenance and self-repair of ships and accelerating the efficiency of ship repair can improve the operational rate of ships.

From the current situation of China's ships, the potential of wooden sailing ships is still very large. According to incomplete statistics, the number of wooden sailing ships for agricultural sideline businesses in China, such as those in Jiangsu Province, exceeds the number of professional wooden sailing ships by more than two times. If we can fully utilize the nation's wooden sailing ships for sideline businesses for transportation, we can increase a great deal of transport capacity. As for carrying out certain technical transformations on the existing professional wooden sailing ships, improving the ship type, and implementing semi-mechanization and mechanization, it will also play a great role in improving their transport capacity. From the results of the technical transformation of wooden sailing ships in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces, the effects are all very good, which can improve both speed and load capacity. In order to solve the tense transportation situation across the country, all localities must also build new types of wooden sailing ships and wooden barges to increase local short-distance transport capacity.

Doing a good job in cooperative relationships is of great significance for tapping the potential of water transport. The characteristic of water transport is to concentrate goods from production sites to the starting port with various transportation tools, load them onto ships, and then transport them to the destination port, and then unload them from the ship at the destination port and transfer them to trains, automobiles, and other transportation tools to transport them to the consumption site. Only in this way can the transportation process be completed. Here, the port is the hub connecting ships, trains, automobiles, and handling tools, as well as material consignment departments, so the port must carry out comprehensive cooperation with all relevant parties in order to organically link the entire transportation chain together and make it smooth and unblocked. For example, under the leadership of the Party committee, Qinhuangdao Port has strengthened cooperation with the railway, implemented four unifications, namely: unified planning, unified office, unified operation command, and unified competition, and strengthened contact with the neighboring railway bureau to strengthen pre-reporting work, so that import and export materials can be concentrated and diverted in a timely manner, which shortens the berthing time of vehicles and ships in the port and accelerates the turnover of ships, which provides greater transport capacity for ships. In short, it is necessary to strengthen the internal cooperation of water transport departments, that is, between ports and ships, between ports, and the external cooperation, that is, with trains, automobiles, and cargo owners, in order to fully exploit the potential of water transport.

Of course, vigorously carrying out mass technical revolution is also an important guarantee for ensuring that water transport doubles. The main goals of the water transport technical revolution are: to implement ship power reform, change slow speed to high speed, change human power to mechanical power, and implement port operation mechanization and joint mechanical operation. In the technical revolution, it is necessary to resolutely implement the mass line of combining indigenous and foreign methods, focusing on indigenous methods, combining popularization and improvement, focusing on popularization; combining experts and the masses, focusing on the masses.

The task of water transport in the fourth quarter is extremely arduous. In order to complete the glorious task of waterborne steel transport, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over water transport work. Implement the principle of the secretary taking the lead, strengthening political and ideological leadership, implementing the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running transportation, carrying out mass movements in a big way, carrying out transportation cooperation movements in a big way, and carrying out technical revolution movements in a big way. But it must also be pointed out here that in order to overcome the contradiction between transport capacity and transport volume, in addition to carrying out mass transportation movements in a big way, we must also make arrangements for the basic construction work of water transport next year and in the second quarter, so as to gradually eliminate the tense situation of water transport from the fundamental level.

    水上运输翻一番
    本报评论员
    交通部最近在武汉召开全国水上钢铁运输跃进会议，作出了“运量加番，当好先行”的决议。这是消除当前运输紧张情况，保证今年生产一千零七十万吨钢的一项重大措施。我们知道，水上运输在整个运输事业中占有重要的地位。水上运输的任务正在不断地增长。据初步估计，全国水上运输第四季度运量要比第三季度增长一倍以上。因此，我国水运职工目前所面临的紧迫任务，就是要努力使水上运力翻一番以上，来适应形势的要求。
    在这里，人们要问：我国水上运输是否存在这样巨大的潜力呢？我们的答复是肯定的。
    当前水上运输潜力最大的、而且能迅速见效的环节是在港口。港口是水上运输的决定性环节，如果能充分发挥港口的通过能力，快装快卸，就能加速货物周转，并由此而充分发挥船舶的运力。有些人认为：“港口通过能力决定于机械设备，我国港口设备差，因而港口通过能力是有限的”。这种意见显然是不正确的。增添现代化的港口机械设备、特别是装卸设备，固然是提高港口通过能力的有效措施，一切有条件的港口都可以朝这方面努力。但这并不等于说，没有现代化的机械设备港口通过能力就不能提高。最近，上海港由于依靠党委、依靠群众，采取蚂蚁搬泰山的办法，就使每日通过能力提高一倍以上，消除了港口阻塞现象。浙江杭州江干码头，用土法实行机械化，也使装卸效力倍增。此外，合理组织和使用劳动力，加强港口调度工作，紧密的组织过驳作业和车、船，船、船直接作业，充分发挥码头、库场的作用，使港际作业有机地结合起来，也能提高港口的通过能力。由此可见，提高当前各主要港口通过能力，关键是在于依靠党委、依靠群众，挖掘现有设备潜力、库场和港驳的潜力，而不在于单纯依靠增加设备和人力。
    由于当前水上运输短程货多，小港货多，各地方交通运输部门应该特别注意采取简易迅速的方法，建设码头或趸船，组织固定装卸工人，变无港为有港，迅速为船舶运输集散货源，充分发挥船舶的运输效率。
    为了使水上运输翻一番，还要大力挖掘现有船舶的潜力。船舶是水上运输的主要工具，挖掘船舶潜在力量，首先在于发挥马力与载重能力。最近长江航运管理局与上海海运局，采取具体措施增加了34.5％的马力和12.4％的吨位。可见现有船舶的潜力是很大的。在当前现代化船舶还极为缺少的情况下，努力推广拖驳和顶推运输法，也是提高水上运输能力的有效办法。比如海运方面推行货轮拖驳，一船两用的方法，提高了运力达26％。湖北等省推行无舵顶推和铁木船混合编队，载重量提高了50％—100％，航速还可以提高10％—15％。如果能大力改善运行组织，合理配载，实行定船、定线、定码头的先进工作方法，并在一切可能范围内组织直达运输，减少物资中转，都能提高运力。此外，加强对船舶的保养、自修，加快船舶修理效率等等，都能提高船舶的营运率。
    从当前我国船舶情况来看，木帆船的潜在力量还是很大的。根据不完全的统计，我国农业副业的木帆船，例如江苏省副业木帆船就超过专业木帆船二倍以上。如果能充分利用全国副业木帆船来进行运输，就可以增加很大的运力。至于对现有专业的木帆船，进行一定的技术改造，改良船型，实行半机械化和机械化，对于提高它们的运力，也会起很大的作用。从江苏、安徽、湖南等省实行木帆船技术改造的结果来看，效果都是很好的，既能提高航速，也能提高载重量。为了解决全国各地运输紧张局面，各地还须增造新型的木帆船和木驳，以便增加地方性的短途运力。
    搞好协作关系，对于发挥水上运输的潜力，有着重大的意义。水运的特点是将各种运输工具从生产场所集中到起点港的货物，装到船上以后，经过运行送到目的港，然后再由目的港从船上御下来，转由火车或汽车等等运输工具运送到消费地点，只有这样，才能完成运输的过程。在这里，港口是连接轮船、火车、汽车和搬运工具，以及物资托运部门的枢纽，所以港口必须与一切有关方面进行全面的合作，才能使整个运输环节有机地联结在一起，畅通无阻。例如秦皇岛港在党委领导下，加强与铁路协作，实行四统，即：统一计划，统一办公，统一作业指挥，统一竞赛，并和邻近铁路局进行联系，加强预确报工作，使进出口物资能及时集中和疏运，这就缩短了车、船在港停泊时间，加速了船舶周转，也就为船舶提供了更大的运力。总之，必须加强水运部门内部，即港船间，港与港间，以及外部，即与火车、汽车和货主间的协作，才能充分发挥水上运输的潜力。
    当然，大力进行群众性的技术革命，也是保证水上运输翻一番的重要保证。水上运输技术革命的主要目标是：实行船舶动力改革，变慢速为快速，变人力为机械，实行港口作业机械化，机械操作联合化。在技术革命中要坚决贯彻土洋结合，土法为主，普及与提高相结合，普及为主；专家与群众相结合，群众为主的群众性的方针。
    第四季度水上运输任务是极其艰巨的。为了完成水上钢铁运输的光荣任务，必须加强党对水上运输工作的领导。实行书记挂帅，加强政治思想领导，贯彻全党全民办运输的方针，大搞群众运动，大搞运输协作运动，大闹技术革命运动。但在这里也必须指出，为了克服运力与运量不相适应的矛盾，除了要大搞群众性的运输运动外，还须对明年的和第二季度的水上运输基本建设工作作好安排，以便从基本上逐步消除水上运输的紧张情况。
