    New Recruit
    ——Soldier Poem
    A new "recruit" came to our company,
    His military service outstrips my age,
    Though he's been in the revolution so long,
    He still shares the five things with us;
    He takes his post in the squad right away,
    And labors when off duty,
    He's active in work and observes discipline;
    Truly a good "recruit,"
    He doesn't mind the coarse sorghum rice,
    Doesn't mind the hard soldier's bunk,
    He joins in singing and learning,
    And is just like all the other soldiers;
    If you ask who this person is?
    It's our old Commander.

    新列兵
    ——战士诗
    我连来个新“列兵”，
    军龄赛过我年龄，
    虽然革命这样久，
    还和我们搞五同；
    到了班里就上岗，
    下得岗来又劳动，
    工作积极守纪律；
    真是一个好“列兵”，
    不嫌高粱米饭粗，
    不嫌士兵铺板硬，
    唱歌学习全参加，
    一切和兵全相同；
    要问此人他是谁？
    就是我们的老司令。
