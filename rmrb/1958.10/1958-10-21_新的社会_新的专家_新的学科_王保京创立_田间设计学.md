New Society, New Experts, New Disciplines
Wang Baojing Establishes "Field Design Science"

    (Our newspaper's reporter, Sun Chuanhao, reports): Wang Baojing, China's first peasant scientific researcher and the director of the Fenghuo People's Commune in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, is establishing a new discipline – "Field Design Science" – based on his experience in production practice. "Field Design Science" aims to thoroughly change the long-standing extensive farming methods by comprehensively designing all aspects of crop planting, such as cultivated land area and crop rotation, in the same meticulous way as building factories and mines. This approach aims to solve the problems of insufficient ventilation and light, and the difficulties in field management that arise from high-density planting, thereby creating conditions for large-scale, high-yield production.

    In his past production practice, Wang Baojing often encountered the problem that crops on the edges of the field consistently yielded more than those in the center. In 1956, he planned for a yield of 560 jin of seed cotton per mu, but because the cotton bolls in the middle of the field did not open, the actual yield was only 306 jin. After repeated practice, observation, and research, Wang Baojing discovered that the main reason for the lower yield in the center of the cultivated land for various crops was insufficient ventilation and light, which prevented the crops from absorbing sufficient nutrients. This problem has become even more prominent this year with the emergence of high-yield "satellite fields" and the widespread promotion of high-density planting across the country. Wang Baojing thought:

  “Crops are like people. People need food and clothing to grow and develop, and crops need sufficient water and fertilizer; people need comfortable living conditions, and crops also need a suitable growing environment. The lack of ventilation and light in the middle of the cultivated land must be actively addressed, otherwise there is no reliable guarantee for achieving high yields.” Based on these principles, he decided to break with the original farming system this year and seriously began experimental research on field design.

    Currently, Wang Baojing has independently created six different forms of field design, which comprehensively solve the problem of crops in the middle of the cultivated land receiving sufficient sunlight and air, just like crops growing on the edges of the field. These six designs are: 1. Intercropping wheat and cotton, dividing the large area of cultivated land into smaller blocks with five-foot and three-foot intervals, sowing wheat every five feet and cotton every three feet. This change in cultivation greatly increases the number of border rows, which facilitates field management and is conducive to the development of wheat ears and ventilation and light. 2. Convex planting. The middle two feet of each five-foot planting width are raised by building fences and adding soil, so that the wheat in the middle can easily develop outward and receive sufficient sunlight and air. 3. Terraced or sloping planting. After implementing convex planting, the remaining one and a half feet of planting width on both sides are made into terraces or slopes for sowing, which solves the problem of ventilation and light and also increases the planting area. 4. Wavy planting. In each five-foot wide planting width, the soil is mounded into a round slope (high in the middle and low on both sides) for sowing, which provides ventilation and light and increases the planting area. 5. Block planting. Wheat is planted in one block and cotton is planted in another block, so that the crops are ventilated on all sides and field management is also convenient. 6. Aerial planting. In addition to the original land planting area, scaffolding is built in the air, and soil is placed in bamboo baskets for sowing or planting wheat. To solve the problem of sunlight exposure, only half of the land per mu is used for aerial planting, and movable frames are built for easy movement.

    Wang Baojing – this innovative peasant researcher who firmly believes that "man will conquer nature" – is full of confidence in his ongoing experimental research on "Field Design Science."

    王保京创立“田间设计学”
    本报讯　记者孙传镐报道：我国第一个农民科学研究员、陕西省醴泉县烽火人民公社社长王保京，根据生产实践中的体会和经验，正在创立一门新的的学科——“田间设计学”。“田间设计学”，主要是使种植农作物都像建设工厂矿山一样，从耕地面积、作物的轮作套种等各方面进行周密综合的设计，彻底改变长期以来粗放的耕作方法，以解决农作物高度密植后难于解决的通风透光不足和做活困难等问题，为大面积高额丰产创造条件。
    王保京在过去的生产实践中，常常碰到这样一个问题：地边的作物产量总比地中间的作物产量高。1956年有一亩棉花，计划亩产籽棉五百六十斤，结果因棉田中间的部分桃子没有开裂，仅产籽棉三百零六斤。经过多次实践、观察和研究，王保京发现各类作物耕地中间部分产量所以低，主要原因是通风透光不足，农作物吸收不到丰富的营养。今年全国各地高额“卫星田”的出现，高额密植的大量推广，这个问题显得更突出了。王保京想：
  “庄稼如同人一样。人的发育生长要吃要穿，庄稼需要水饱肥足；人需要舒适的居住条件，庄稼同样也需要适宜的生长环境。耕地中间部分通风透光不足，必须积极想办法解决，否则争取高额丰产就没有可靠保证。”根据这些道理，今年他决心打破原有的耕作制度，认真地开始了田间设计的试验研究工作。
    现在，王保京已独创出六种不同的田间设计形式，从各个方面妥善地解决了耕地中间部分的作物也能像生长在地边的作物那样，得到充足的阳光和空气。这六种设计是：一、麦棉间作，把耕地面积大块变成小块，划成五尺和三尺的间隔，每隔五尺播种小麦，每隔三尺播种棉花。这样改变耕作以后，大大增加了边行，既便于做活管理，又利于麦穗头施展和通风透光。二、凸形播种。把每五尺播种幅度中的中间二尺的部位，编篱笆用土加高，使中间部分的小麦也便于向外发展，得到充足的阳光和空气。三、梯形或坡形播种，在实行凸形播种后，把两边剩余的各一尺半的播种幅度，搞成阶梯形或坡形下种，这样既解决了通风透光问题，还可以增加播种面积。四、波浪式播种，在每五尺宽的播种幅度中，用土培成圆坡形（中间高，两边低）进行播种，既通风透光，又增大播种面积。五、区田播种，每隔一方块种麦，另一方块种棉花，使作物四面通风，做活也方便。六、空中播种，除原有土地播种面积外，再在空中搭架，用竹筐装土播种或栽麦。为解决日光照射问题，每亩只用一半土地在空中播种，并且搭成活动架，以便来往移动。
    王保京——这位富于革新精神，坚信“人定胜天”的农民研究员，他对自己正在进行的这个“田间设计学”的试验研究，满怀信心。
