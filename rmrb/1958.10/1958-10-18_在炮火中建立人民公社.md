    Xinhua News Agency report: The Frontline, July 1st, and May 1st agricultural cooperatives on Xiamen Island, at the forefront of the coastal defense, merged on the 11th to form the Frontline People's Commune. The Party Secretary of the Commune said: The establishment of the commune signifies that the island's farmers have twisted themselves into an even thicker rope in the struggle against the enemy and in production, tightening it even further around the enemy's neck.

    The farmers of Xiamen Island, organized in the midst of battle, are making their utmost efforts to support the People's Liberation Army with material resources and manpower, dealing heavy blows to the enemy. They supply whatever the troops need. The relationship between the army and the people is harmonious and seamless. The leaders of the troops stationed on the front lines say that when they arrive at the front lines of Xiamen Island, it is like arriving in an old liberated area.

    While tensely supporting the front lines in the struggle against the enemy, the farmers of Xiamen Island have consistently persisted in production and construction. For several years, they have been plowing the land and planting crops using the method of "the enemy bombards during the day, we work at night; the enemy bombards at night, we work during the day; they bombard here, we work there; they bombard there, we work here." This year, the average yield of early rice per mu was over 500 jin, more than double the yield in 1954. The island's cultural life is also extremely active. There are basically no more illiterate people among the farmers, and some farmers have even entered middle schools and agricultural universities. During the days of the artillery battles in September this year, the farmers also held fifteen sports meets and individual competitions.

    在炮火中建立人民公社
    据新华社讯　海防前线厦门岛上的前线、七一、五一等三个农业社，在11日合并组成前线人民公社。公社党委书记说：公社的建立，意味着岛上农民在对敌斗争和生产中拧成了一条更粗的绳子，更紧地套在敌人的脖子上。
    在战斗中组织起来的厦门岛农民，以最大的努力，从物力、人力上来支援人民解放军，沉重地打击敌人。部队需要什么，他们就供应什么。军民之间融洽无间。驻前线部队的首长们说，他们到了厦门岛前沿，就像到了老解放区一样。
    厦门岛上的农民在紧张的支援前线对敌斗争的同时，始终坚持生产建设。几年来，他们就是以“敌人白天打炮晚上干，晚上打炮白天干，这边打炮那边干，那边打炮这边干”的办法，翻耕了土地，种植了作物。今年早稻平均亩产量在五百斤以上，比1954年增产一倍以上。岛上的文化生活也极活跃。农民中已基本上没有文盲，有的农民还进了中学和农业大学。在今年9月炮战的日子里，农民们还举行了十五次运动会和单项竞赛。
