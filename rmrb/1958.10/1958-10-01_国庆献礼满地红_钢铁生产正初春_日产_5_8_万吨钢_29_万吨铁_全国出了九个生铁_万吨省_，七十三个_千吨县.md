Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: September 29, 1958, was a glorious page in the history of China's industrial development. On this day, from midnight to midnight, the army fighting on the national steel front launched two high-yield steel "satellites": a daily output of 58,220 tons of steel and 292,580 tons of iron, as the most solemn gift to National Day.

On the 30th, the dispatch telephone room of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry was bustling with ringing telephones and voices, as the steel army from all over the country reported their remarkable achievements on the 29th with excited voices from all directions of the motherland.

On this day, in addition to Liaoning Province, which had already exceeded 10,000 tons, eight more provinces produced over 10,000 tons of pig iron: Henan (90,700 tons), Hebei (58,000 tons), Shanxi (26,000 tons), Hubei (16,900 tons), Hunan (15,000 tons), Shandong (14,000 tons, excluding 53,000 tons of category two iron), Jiangsu (10,000 tons) and finally reported Sichuan Province (10,200 tons). In addition, the output of pig iron in Jiangxi and Guangxi also increased dramatically on the 29th, both reaching several thousand tons, an increase of more than ten times compared to the previous few days.

On this day, according to incomplete statistics, there were seventy-three "thousand-ton counties (cities)" (some of which reached 10,000 tons), namely: Yuxian, Baofeng, Xinyang, Shangcheng, Puyang, Anyang, Neihuang, Nanle, Qingfeng, Linxian, Bo'ai, Yanshi, Dengfeng in Henan; Baoding City, Zhangjiakou City, Shijiazhuang City, Chengde City, Tangxian, Qingyuan, Gaoyang, Zhuoxian, Xincheng, Laishui, Xiongxian, Wu'an, Xushui, Xingtai, Yongnian, Zhangbei, Huailai, Yuanshi, Jingxing, Xinle, Zhengding, Qian'an, Qianxi, Luanxian in Hebei; Jincheng, Gaoping, Yangquan, Changzhi, Taiyuan City, Yangcheng, Xiyang, Lingchuan, Yuxian, Xiangqin, Hequ, Xinjiang, Xinning in Shanxi; Echeng, Luotian, Macheng, Hong'an, Baokang, Suixian in Hubei; Lianyuan, Xinhua, Shaodong, Shuangfeng, Youxian in Hunan; Zibo City, Jinan City, Weifang City, Linyi in Shandong; Nanjing City, Wuxi City, Xuzhou City in Jiangsu; Yuexi, Jinzhai in Anhui; Yongxin in Jiangxi; Huanjiang, Luocheng in Guangxi.

On this day, in terms of steel production, seven provinces and five enterprises launched high-yield "satellites."

Among these seven provinces, the steel production in Henan and Sichuan both jumped to a daily output of 5,000 tons, the steel production in Shanxi also reached a daily output of 4,000 tons, and the steel production in Hunan, Shandong, Guangxi, and Guangdong increased by five to six times to dozens of times; the five enterprises were Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Daye Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Beijing Steel Plant, and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, all of which experienced a leap in steel production on the 29th.

The high-yield "satellite" on the 29th marked a new peak in China's steel production level. On this day, steel increased by 165% and iron increased by 1020% compared to the average daily output in August. In 1949, when the five-star red flag was first raised in Tiananmen Square and the People's Republic of China was just proclaimed, the steel industry, devastated by the Kuomintang reactionary group, produced only 158,000 tons of steel and 246,000 tons of iron for the entire year.

September was the first month of the nationwide battle for steel since the Enlarged Meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in August. Compared with the average daily output in August, steel increased by 12% and iron increased by 47.6% from September 1st to 25th; while from September 26th to 28th, steel increased by 20.9% and iron increased by 162.5%. Among them, on the 28th, the national pig iron production exceeded 100,000 tons. It can be clearly seen that the steel production in September was rising step by step, and after entering the 25th, it became a big step forward. Because the Party committees at all levels have truly grasped the leadership of steel production and gone all out; all localities have gradually grasped and implemented the line of simultaneous development of large, medium, and small, with "small, indigenous, and mass" as the main focus; this has rapidly formed a magnificent mass movement of the whole people in steel production. On September 15th, the first "10,000-ton province" of pig iron, Henan Province, appeared, opening the prelude to the movement for high-yield steel. By the 29th, in just less than half a month, it had expanded to nine "10,000-ton provinces" and seventy-three "1,000-ton counties," resulting in a grand occasion of "satellite" launches and flourishing flowers. On this day, on China's 9.6 million square kilometers of land, 50 million steel soldiers were busy day and night in front of roaring furnaces, at the mining sites where sparks and rock dust were flying, in the coal mines, and on the transportation lines. From dawn to dusk, smoke billowed everywhere, and lights flickered. Coupled with the arduous support of the staff and workers on the transportation front and the efforts of coal miners and other large armies of workers, it constituted a magnificent picture of a great battle for steel that shook the world.

In the past month, all sectors of society, including workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants, all industrial, transportation, and other departments across the country, have twisted into one rope and worked together to contribute their strength to steel production. This unprecedented, national-scale large-scale collaboration is the main reason for the successful launch of this high-yield steel "satellite."

The launch of the high-yield steel "satellite" on the 29th was a successful rehearsal. It successfully inspected the strength of the steel front in September and sounded the first battle drum for the season of bumper harvests in China's steel industry in the next three months. In the next three months, the favorable situation for China's steel industry is that the mass steel production movement of the whole people, led by the first secretary of the Party committee at all levels, is surging forward and developing in depth; some high-yield experiences have been accumulated; the principle of simultaneous development of large, medium, and small steel production, with "small, indigenous, and mass" as the main focus, is being further implemented in various places; and the original relatively backward areas and enterprises are catching up; the new force of steel production in various places - new equipment is being put into production in batches; and the ore, coal, and other materials needed for the safe wintering of small and indigenous blast furnaces are being stepped up.

Full of confidence, the steel army is now stepping up the creation and promotion of experience in indigenous steelmaking; striving for a large-scale harvest of pig iron; and striving to overcome the technical hurdle of "using indigenous iron to make good steel." They said: "Turn 'satellites' into large-scale high yields, increase the proportion of small and indigenous blast furnaces put into production to more than 60%, and increase the proportion of those put into production that can produce normally to more than 60%." The 29th is a good starting point for them to move towards new victories.

    国庆献礼满地红　钢铁生产正初春
    日产5.8万吨钢　29万吨铁
    全国出了九个生铁“万吨省”，七十三个“千吨县”
    新华社30日讯　1958年9月29日，是我国工业发展史上光辉的一页。这一天，从午夜零时到深夜二十四时，鏖战在全国钢铁战线上的大军，发射了两颗钢铁高产“卫星”：日产钢五万八千二百二十吨，铁二十九万二千五百八十吨；作为对国庆节最隆重的献礼。
    30日，冶金工业部的调度电话室里铃声、人声鼎沸，各地钢铁大军用激动的声音，从祖国的四面八方汇报了他们在29日所获取的赫赫战绩。
    这一天，除过去辽宁省是万吨以上的省以外，全国又出现了八个生铁“万吨省”，即：河南（九点○七万吨）、河北（五点八万吨）、山西（二点六万吨）、湖北（一点六九万吨）、湖南（一点五万吨）、山东（一点四万吨，另有二类铁五点三万吨未计算在内）、江苏（一万吨）及最后报来的四川省（一点○二万吨）。另外还有江西、广西、二个省区的生铁产量，在29日也有飞跃的增长，都达到了大几千吨，较前几天的产量都增长了十倍以上。
    这一天，据不完全统计，出现了七十三个“千吨县（市）”（其中个别的达到了一万吨），即：河南的禹县、宝丰、信阳、商城、濮阳、安阳、内黄、南乐、清丰、林县、博爱、偃师、登封；河北的保定市、张家口市、石家庄市、承德市、唐县、清苑、高阳、涿县、新城、涞水、雄县、武安、徐水、邢台、永年、张北、怀来、元氏、井陉、新乐、正定、迁安、迁西、滦县；山西的晋城、高平、阳泉、长治、太原市、阳城、昔阳、陵川、盂县、襄沁、河曲、新绛、隰宁；湖北的鄂城、罗田、麻城、红安、保康、随县；湖南的涟源、新化、邵东、双峰、攸县；山东的淄博市、济南市、潍坊市、临沂；江苏的南京市、无锡市、徐州市；安徽的岳西、金寨；江西的永新；广西的环江、罗城。
    这一天，钢的产量方面，有七个省和五个企业放出了高产“卫星”。
    这七个省中，河南、四川的钢产量，都跃进到日产五千吨，山西的钢产量也达到日产四千吨，湖南、山东、广西、广东四省区的钢产量各增长了五、六倍至数十倍；五个企业是鞍山钢铁公司、大冶钢厂、天津钢厂、北京钢厂及本溪钢铁公司，这些企业在29日的钢产量都有飞跃的增长。
    29日的高产“卫星”，使我国的钢铁生产水平登上了一个新的高峰。这一天，比8月份平均日产量，钢增加了165％，铁增加了1020％。而在1949年，当五星红旗第一次在天安门广场上冉冉升起，中华人民共和国刚刚宣告诞生的时候，被国民党反动集团蹂躏得残破不堪的钢铁工业，全年只生产了十五万八千吨钢，二十四万六千吨铁。
    9月份是自从8月中共中央政治局扩大会议以来全民为钢铁而战的第一个月。以每天平均产量和8月份比较，9月1日到25日，钢增长了12％，铁增长了47.6％；而26日到28日，钢增长了20.9％，铁增长了162.5％。其中28日，全国生铁产量突破了十万吨。可以明显地看出，9月份的钢铁产量是步步高升的，而进入25日以后，就成为大踏步地前进了。由于各级党委已经切切实实地抓紧了对钢铁生产的领导，全力以赴；各地在钢铁工业战线上逐步掌握和贯彻执行了大、中、小同时并举而目前以“小、土、群”为主的路线；这就使钢铁生产运动迅速形成了一个波澜壮阔的全民的群众性的运动。9月15日出现了第一个生铁“万吨省”——河南省，揭开了钢铁丰产运动的序幕。到29日，只不过短短的不到半个月的时间，就扩展到了九个“万吨省”，七十三个“千吨县”，出现了“卫星”连发、百花齐放的盛况。这一天，在我国九百六十万平方公里的土地上，五千万钢铁大军在烈焰熊熊的炉前，火花、岩粉迸飞的采矿场上，煤井里和运输线上，昼夜奔忙。从凌晨到深夜，处处炉烟弥漫，火光闪闪，加上交通运输战线上职工的苦战支援，煤矿工人及其他工人大军的努力生产，就构成了一幅威震天地的大战钢铁图景。
    一个月来，全国的工、农、兵、学、商各界，所有的工业、交通和其他部门，为了完成钢铁生产任务，拧成一股绳，同心协力，人人争为钢铁生产贡献自己的力量，这种史无前例的、全国规模的大协作，是这次钢铁高产“卫星”上天的主要原因。
    29日钢铁高产“卫星”的放射，是一次成功的预演，它胜利地检阅了9月份钢铁战线的实力，为今后三个月我国钢铁工业大丰收的季节敲响了第一声战鼓。今后三个月，我国钢铁工业的有利形势是，各级党委第一书记亲自挂帅的全民的群众性的钢铁生产运动，正在奔腾前进，深入发展；已经积累了一些高产经验；钢铁生产的大、中、小同时并举而目前以“小、土、群”为主的方针正在各地进一步地贯彻执行，原来那些比较落后的地区和企业，都在纷纷赶上来；各地钢铁生产的生力军——新设备正成批地投入生产；小高炉、土高炉安全过冬所需要的矿石、煤炭和其他物料，正在加紧储备。
    满怀信心的钢铁大军，现在正加紧创造和推广土法炼钢的经验；争取生铁的大面积丰收；奋力抢渡“用土铁炼好钢”的技术关。他们表示：“把‘卫星’变成大面积丰产，把小高炉、土高炉的投入生产的比例达到60％以上，把投入生产能够正常生产的比例达到60％以上”。29日是他们奔向新的胜利一个良好的起跑点。
