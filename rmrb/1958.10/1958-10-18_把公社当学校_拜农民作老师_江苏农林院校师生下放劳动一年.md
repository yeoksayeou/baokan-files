Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, October 17th: The Nanjing Agricultural College, Nanjing Forestry College, and Subei Agricultural College have decided to send more than 4,500 teachers and students to rural areas of Jiangsu to participate in production labor for one year.

The Party committees of these three agricultural and forestry colleges have respectively put forward requirements to the teachers and students of each school, asking them to transform their thinking in production labor, resolutely struggle against bourgeois viewpoints, bourgeois individualism, the underestimation of physical labor, and idealistic viewpoints, in order to establish and consolidate the working-class viewpoint, mass viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and dialectical materialist viewpoint; to absorb experience in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and the management of people's communes in the areas where they are sent, and to use this as the center to compile various textbooks for agricultural and forestry universities, so as to overcome the problem of education being seriously divorced from production practice, which has long existed in agricultural and forestry colleges, and to effectively reform the education of agricultural and forestry colleges; at the same time, in grassroots production activities, to assist people's communes in popularizing science and technology, carry out cultural and educational activities, make contributions to the great leap forward in agricultural and forestry production, better improve and develop agricultural and forestry science, and promote the great development of production.

Before being sent down, these agricultural and forestry colleges launched a great airing of views, great debates. The majority of teachers and students resolutely supported the Central Committee's instructions on improving the education of agricultural and forestry colleges and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee's decision on sending teachers and students of agricultural and forestry colleges to rural areas to labor for one year. They believed that this was the Party's most cordial concern for agricultural and forestry colleges. They posted big-character posters, wrote letters of determination and competition, and many classes of students held rallies and parades, expressing their determination to fulfill the Party's requirements. However, a very small number of teachers and students expressed doubt about this measure of participating in production labor. Some teachers and students at Nanjing Agricultural College said: "Theory is authoritative and unchanging, practice is accidental and changeable, and the university is a place for researching scientific theory and does not need accidental practical experience"; others said: "If we do this, how can we catch up with the world's advanced level in twelve years?"; "Labor production is just simple repetition, can we learn anything from farmers?" In response to these erroneous arguments, fierce debates were launched in each class, grade, department, and even the entire school. At the debates, teachers and students who had already participated in production labor cited a large number of facts to criticize the fallacies of "theory is unchanging" and so on. They said: Before work-study programs, students who had studied at junior agricultural schools, intermediate agricultural schools, and senior agricultural schools called sweet potatoes mung beans, lentils broad beans, and reeds corn, and hoed out more than seventy seedlings in one hour in the field, and did not know how to use a sprayer. After work-study programs, in just a few months, everyone not only became familiar with their own professional knowledge, but also learned a variety of knowledge related to agricultural affairs, and could not only talk but also do, from not distinguishing rice seedlings from barnyard grass to being able to create high yields with their own hands. Many teachers and students also used the facts of the great yields created by farmers to refute the fallacies of "science does not come from under the hoe" and "cannot catch up with the world's advanced scientific level."

This debate made the Party's red flag of "combining education with productive labor" even more distinct. Before their departure, the more than two thousand teachers and students sent down from Nanjing Agricultural College put forward the slogan "Take the commune as a school, take the farmers as teachers, and take the fields as classrooms," and happily went to the countryside.

    把公社当学校　拜农民作老师
    江苏农林院校师生下放劳动一年
    新华社南京17日电　南京农学院、南京林学院和苏北农学院决定把师生四千五百多人，分别下放到江苏农村参加生产劳动一年。
    这三所农林学院的党委分别对各校师生提出，要求他们在生产劳动中改造思想，坚决与资产阶级观点、资产阶级个人主义、轻视体力劳动以及唯心主义的观点作斗争，以建立和巩固工人阶级观点、群众观点、劳动观点与辩证唯物主义观点；吸收下放地区农、林、畜牧业和人民公社经营管理等方面的经验，并以此为中心，编写农、林大学的各种教科书，以克服农、林院校长期以来严重存在的教育脱离生产实践的毛病，有效地改革农林大专院校的教育；同时，在基层生产活动中，协助人民公社普及科学技术，开展文化教育活动，为农林业生产大跃进作出贡献，更好地提高和发展农、林业科学，促进生产大发展。
    下放之前，这几所农林院校都展开了大鸣、大放、大辩论。大多数师生都坚决拥护中央关于改进农林大专院校教育的指示和中共江苏省委关于农林大专院校师生下放农村劳动一年的决定。他们认为这是党对农林大专院校的最亲切的关怀。纷纷贴大字报、写决心书和竞赛书，许多班级学生还举行了集会游行，表示一定要实现党的要求。但也有极少数师生对这次下放参加生产劳动的措施表示怀疑，南京农学院有些师生说：“理论是权威的，不变的，实践是偶然的，可变的，大学是研究科学理论的场所，不需要偶然的实践经验”；也有人说：“这样一搞，十二年内怎么能赶上世界先进水平？”；“劳动生产只是简单的重复，我们能向农民学到东西么？”对于这些错误的论调，各班、级、系甚至全校展开了激烈辩论。在辩论会上，已经参加过生产劳动的师生们，举出大量事实，批判了“理论不变”等的谬论。他们说：勤工俭学以前，读过初级农校、中级农校和高级农校的学生，见了地瓜说是绿豆、扁豆，见了芦苇说是玉米，下到地里一小时锄掉七十几根苗，拿到喷雾器不会使。经过勤工俭学，仅仅几个月，大家不仅熟悉了本行专业知识，还学会了与农事有关的多种知识，不仅会说，而且会做，从稻稗不分到能亲手创造丰产。许多教师和学生还用农民创造的大丰产事实，驳倒了“锄头底下不出科学”，“赶不上世界先进科学水平”的谬论。
    经过这场辩论，使党的“教育和生产劳动相结合”红旗更加鲜明了。南京农学院二千多下放师生在出发前提出了“以公社为学校，拜农民为老师，把田间当课堂”的口号，愉快地奔赴农村。
