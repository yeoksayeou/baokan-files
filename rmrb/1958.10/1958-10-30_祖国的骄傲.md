The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation, led by General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, returned to the capital of the great motherland on the 28th, holding high the victorious red flag of resisting America and aiding Korea. The 650 million people of the motherland rejoiced at the triumphant return of their heroic sons and daughters and were proud of their great achievements!

The heroic sons and daughters have not failed the entrustment of the motherland, nor have they failed the wise teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao. Together with the heroic Korean people, they experienced the most brutal war in the world, defeated the vicious enemy, exposed the American paper tiger, defended peace in the Far East and the world, made contributions to the justice and happiness of mankind, and added infinite glory to the motherland.

The delegation, headed by General Yang Yong and General Wang Ping, was composed of 150 outstanding figures selected from the headquarters and various arms of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Among them were generals with graying hair who had experienced hundreds of battles, resourceful and brave commanders at all levels, combat heroes from Shangganling, Maliang Mountain, Old Baldy Mountain, and the Jincheng area, sentries guarding Kaesong and patrolling the 38th parallel—the forefront of Eastern peace—logistical soldiers on the steel transportation line, and engineering technical experts who shed their sweat on the Grand Hall of Pyongyang.

Here is the hero Lu Changrong, who severely struck the American invading army's "ace" 7th Division. In the famous counterattack at North Mountain of Shixian Cave in July 1953, he led a company of soldiers, under the cover of powerful artillery fire, and in just over ten minutes, captured the fortified mountain position held by a reinforced company of the 17th Regiment of the U.S. 7th Division, wiping out the enemy completely. Then, unwilling to admit defeat, the American invading army launched a frantic counterattack under the cover of artillery, aircraft, and tanks. Lu Changrong was wounded. But this heroic company commander stubbornly persisted in the battle, encouraging the soldiers: "Win glory for the motherland! Win glory for Chairman Mao!" When their weapons were broken, they seized the enemy's weapons to fight; when ammunition ran out, they took bullets and grenades from the enemy's corpses and fiercely returned fire. The fierce, repeated battle for the mountain position lasted a full day and two nights. Lu Changrong and his soldiers continuously repelled eleven frenzied counterattacks by the enemy, killing and wounding more than 400 enemy soldiers, and capturing eleven American devils alive.

Combat heroes Wang Huyuan, Zhao Jihua, and Xie Fazheng also made immortal contributions to the motherland, demonstrating the heroic spirit of Chinese men with their unwavering loyalty and indomitable spirit. In particular, the young commander Wang Zhanshan, who participated in the last battle of the Korean War—the Jincheng counterattack—displayed the noble style of a Communist Party member. He still clearly remembers that on that smoke-filled hill, he erected a red flag with a heroic oath written on it: "I, Wang Zhanshan, am a member of the Chinese Communist Party, a good son of the Chinese nation, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, I can capture it, I can hold it, where I am, there is the position!" He was seriously wounded three times in the battle, fell unconscious, and woke up again, enduring the severe pain, rolling, crawling, and leading the soldiers of the entire platoon to fight at the forefront of the position. When there was no food, they gnawed on grass roots; when there was no water to drink, they drank urine. When the ammunition ran out, they picked up stones and smashed the enemy's heads. The heroes fought continuously for four days and nights, finally repelling more than thirty fierce attacks by the enemy, eliminating more than 400 enemy soldiers. It was on this steel position, covered with enemy corpses, that Wang Zhanshan and his comrades, filled with Chinese pride, greeted the victorious news that the American warmongers were forced to sign the armistice agreement.

During the three years of the Korean War, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, holding high the red flag of Chairman Mao Zedong's military thought, walked a glorious path of becoming stronger with each battle. At the same time, the movement of donating airplanes and artillery launched by the people of the motherland also timely "equipped the heroic sons and daughters fighting on the Korean front with modern wings." Many generals and artillery heroes in the glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation expressed their gratitude and described how they used tanks and artillery donated by the people of the motherland to fiercely bombard the enemy on the Shangganling, Maliang Mountain, Old Baldy Mountain, and Jincheng fronts, as well as moving heroic deeds. In the summer campaign of 1953 alone, the "215" tank of the tank unit where the meritorious car commander Yuan Jiashu belonged destroyed four M-46 "Iron Tortoise" tanks of the American invading army and damaged one. These brave and fearless tank soldiers realized the ardent wish of "answering the people of the motherland with victory." There is also a heroic anti-aircraft hunter, first-class meritorious Zhang Lichun, who, in one 45-minute anti-aircraft battle, used a heavy machine gun to fire more than 300 bullets, shooting down two enemy planes and damaging one, punishing the inhuman American "air bandits."

Now, these triumphant heroes, while filled with joy over victory and gratitude to the motherland, are also filled with anger at the continued occupation of our country's territory Taiwan and the war provocations by U.S. imperialism. They said that since we were able to defeat the American invading army armed to the teeth in those years, it is even less of a problem today! Combat hero Wang Huyuan, who led his entire company in wiping out more than 500 enemies on "Old Baldy Mountain," is ready to answer the call of the motherland at any time and is willing to contribute everything he has to the cause of defending the motherland. Combat hero Wang Zhanshan said: "We could not tolerate U.S. imperialism invading our neighbor Korea and our country's territory Taiwan eight years ago, how can we allow this paper tiger to continue to infringe upon our motherland's territory today!" Combat hero Lu Changrong even more despises the enemy infinitely. He repeatedly said: "Whether it is U.S. imperialism or any imperialism, it will never be able to bully the Chinese people."

    祖国的骄傲
    新华社记者　姜庆肇、冶峰
    光荣的中国人民志愿军代表团在杨勇上将和王平上将率领下，高举着抗美援朝的胜利红旗，在28日回到了伟大祖国的首都。祖国的六亿五千万人民为自己的英雄儿女凯旋归来而欢腾，为他们的丰功伟绩而骄傲！
    英雄的儿女们，没有辜负祖国的嘱托，没有辜负党和毛主席的英明教导。他们同英雄的朝鲜人民一道，经历了世界上最残酷的战争，打败了凶恶的敌人，戳穿了美国纸老虎，保卫了远东和世界和平，为人类的正义和幸福建树了功勋，为祖国增添了无限的光彩。
    以杨勇上将和王平上将为首的代表团，是由中国人民志愿军总部和各兵种部队选派的一百五十名优秀人物组成的。他们当中有身经百战鬓发斑白的将军，智勇双全的各级指挥员，有来自上甘岭、马良山、老秃山和金城地区的战斗英雄，有保卫开城和巡逻在东方和平前哨——三八线上的哨兵，也有钢铁运输线上的后勤战士和把汗水洒在平壤大厦上的工程兵技术能手。
    这里有痛打美国侵略军“王牌”第七师的英雄陆昌荣。他在1953年7月著名的石岘洞北山反击战中，率领一个连的战士，在强大炮火掩护下，仅仅十多分钟，就一举攻占了美军第七师十七团一个加强连固守的山头阵地，把敌人全部消灭干净。接着，不甘心失败的美国侵略军在大炮、飞机和坦克掩护下进行疯狂反扑。陆昌荣负了伤。但是这位英雄连长，依然顽强地坚持战斗，鼓舞战士们：“为祖国争光！为毛主席争光！”他们的武器打坏了，就夺过敌人的武器打，弹药打光了，就从敌人尸体上解下子弹、手榴弹，狠狠地回敬敌人。激烈、反复的山头争夺战整整进行了一天两夜，陆昌荣和他的战士们连续打垮了敌人十一次猖狂反扑，杀伤敌人四百多名，并活捉了十一个美国鬼子。
    战斗英雄王虎元、赵积华和解法正也都为祖国立下了不朽功勋，表现了中华男儿赤胆忠心、百折不挠的英雄气概。特别是参加过朝鲜战争的最后一仗——金城反击战的青年指挥员王占山，表现了共产党员的崇高风格。他现在也还清楚地记得，在那个硝烟弥漫的山岗上，他竖起了一面红旗，上面写着豪壮的誓言：“我，王占山是中国共产党员，中华民族的好男儿，毛主席的好战士，攻得下，守得住，有我就有阵地！”他在战斗中三次身负重伤，昏迷了，又醒过来，忍着剧疼，滚着，爬着，率领全排的战士们战斗在阵地前沿。没有吃的，他们啃草根，没水喝，喝小便；弹药打光了，他们就抱起石头砸敌人的脑袋。英雄们连续激战四昼夜，终于打垮了敌人三十多次凶猛进攻，消灭敌人四百多名。王占山和他的战友们也就是在这座布满了敌人尸体的钢铁阵地上，满怀着中国人的自豪，迎接了美国战争贩子们被迫在停战协定上签字的胜利喜讯。
    在三年的朝鲜战争中，中国人民志愿军高举着毛泽东主席的军事思想红旗，走过了愈战愈强的光辉道路。同时，祖国人民掀起的捐献飞机大炮的运动，也及时地给战斗在朝鲜前线的英雄儿女们“插上了现代化的翅膀”。光荣的中国人民志愿军代表团里的许多将军和炮兵英雄们，都怀着感激的心情，畅述他们是怎样使用祖国人民捐献的坦克和大炮，在上甘岭、马良山、老秃山和金城前线，猛烈轰击敌人的情景和动人的英雄事迹。参加代表团的功臣车长袁家书所在的一支坦克部队的“二一五”号坦克，光在1953年的夏季战役中，就击毁美国侵略军的M—四六型“铁乌龟”四辆，击伤一辆。这些英勇无畏的坦克手们实现了“用胜利回答祖国人民”的热切愿望。这里还有一位英雄的对空猎手、一等功臣张立春，他在一次四十五分钟的对空战斗中，用高射机枪，打了三百多发子弹，就打落敌机二架，打伤一架，惩罚了惨无人性的美国“空中强盗”。
    现在，这些凯旋而归的英雄们在满怀着对胜利的喜悦和对祖国的感激心情的同时，也满怀着对美帝国主义继续侵占我国领土台湾和进行战争挑衅的怒火。他们说，当年，我们既然能够打败武装到牙齿的美国侵略军队，今天，它就更不在话下！曾经在“老秃山”上率领全连战士歼敌五百多名的战斗英雄王虎元随时准备听候祖国的召唤，并不惜为保卫祖国的事业贡献自己的一切。战斗英雄王占山说：“我们在八年前都不能容忍美帝国主义侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜和我国领土台湾，今天还怎能容许这只纸老虎继续侵犯我们的祖国领土！”战斗英雄陆昌荣更是对敌人无限藐视。他一再说：“不论是美帝国主义，还是什么帝国主义，要想欺侮我们中国人民是永远做不到了。”
