Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 30th – People from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand meeting at the Moranbong Theater tonight to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and to inaugurate "China-Korea Friendship Month."

    On the rostrum of the Moranbong Theater, portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong were hung high. Ten Chinese and Korean national flags were placed on both sides. On the front of the rostrum, a line of white characters read "Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea!"

    At 7 p.m., leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, along with Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, Gan Siqi, deputy head, and others, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, thunderous applause resounded throughout the venue.

    Among those attending today's meeting were Korean Deputy Premiers Hong Myung-hee, Kim Il, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Jung Joon-taek, Vice Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jung-ai, Kim Chang-man and other leaders, as well as heads of democratic political parties, social organizations, senior generals of the People's Army, and well-known figures from all walks of life.

    Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and embassy staff, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army delegation led by General Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the Volunteer Army, were invited to attend the meeting. Envoys from fraternal countries stationed in Korea also attended the meeting.

    Park Jung-ai, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, delivered a report at the meeting. She first extended warm congratulations on the National Day of the People's Republic of China on behalf of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and the entire Korean people. She also expressed a warm welcome to the Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo.

    Park Jung-ai said that the People's Republic of China has made tremendous achievements in the cause of building socialism. The Chinese people are catching up with the level reached by capitalist countries in one hundred to two hundred years in the shortest possible time. She spoke in detail about the achievements made by the Chinese people in industrial and agricultural production during the Great Leap Forward. She said that today, the People's Republic of China has become a strong socialist country, making a great contribution to peace in the Far East and the world. We are proud to have such a neighbor.

    Park Jung-ai said that the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea have been consolidated and developed through various tests. During the Korean Fatherland Liberation War, the Chinese people sent the Volunteer Army, which fought alongside the Korean people to defeat the American imperialists and made a great contribution to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people aided the Korean people during the period of reconstruction after the Korean War. The long-term trade agreement recently signed in Beijing between the two countries will help promote the socialist construction of both countries, especially the long-term loan granted by China to Korea, which is another manifestation of the Chinese people's assistance to the Korean people.

    Park Jung-ai condemned the aggressive acts of military provocation by US imperialism against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait. She said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has issued a statement supporting the just struggle of the Chinese people. She said that the US imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and the people of the world, have intensified their military provocations and, on the 24th, instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to use missile weapons to attack the Chinese mainland. She said that if the US imperialists do not stop this behavior, they will suffer even more disastrous defeats.

    Park Jung-ai said that the Korean people will forever advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people in the struggle against the US imperialists and will further strengthen their close unity with the Chinese people.

    Park Jung-ai said that in order to further strengthen the traditional friendship between the people of China and Korea, the Cabinet of the Republic has decided to designate October this year as "China-Korea Friendship Month." She said, "I am honored to announce the opening of this Friendship Month." At this moment, warm and prolonged applause resounded throughout the venue.

    Head of Delegation Guo Moruo addressed the meeting amid warm applause. Every sentence he spoke elicited enthusiastic applause.

    In his speech, he repeatedly mentioned the militant friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and Korea. He said that this friendship is a model of proletarian internationalism, and it will forever radiate brilliant light in human history.

    In his speech, Guo Moruo pointed out that the holding of "China-Korea Friendship Month" is a further expression of the profound friendship of the heroic Korean people towards the Chinese people. He said that on behalf of the 650 million people of China, we extend our highest respect and sincere gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and Premier Kim Il-sung for initiating "China-Korea Friendship Month."

    In his speech, Guo Moruo condemned the US imperialists for carrying out unscrupulous military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people in the Taiwan area, grossly interfering in China's internal affairs, and obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their islands of Jinmen, Mazu, and Taiwan. He emphatically pointed out the heinous crime of the American warmongers recently instructing Chiang's bandits to use missiles for the first time in the history of world warfare. He said that while the United States is stepping up its efforts to turn Taiwan into a military base for attacking the Chinese mainland, it is also using the Warsaw Sino-US ambassadorial talks to play the trick of asking us to "cease fire." He said, "It is the United States itself that is playing with fire, and yet it wants us to 'cease fire.' This is to force us to submit to its military force and acquiesce to the US occupation of our territory. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. We must shout loudly to the American aggressors: You should stop playing with fire and stop your atomic blackmail policy, and get out of the Taiwan Strait quickly! We believe that with the fraternal countries of the vast socialist camp standing with us, and with the peace-loving people of the whole world standing with us, any war provocations by US imperialism against China and Korea will meet with even more shameful defeats."

    Then, Guo Moruo, on behalf of the Chinese People's Delegation, presented a flag to the Korean people, and Vice Premier Kim Il received the flag. On this huge red flag was embroidered a poem in golden characters: "Puncture the paper tiger and build great achievements, unifying the country is in sight, international spirit spreads throughout the universe, the Korean nation is heroic."

    After the meeting, the art troupes from various Korean provinces, which were performing in Pyongyang, gave a joint performance.

    朝中友谊永远放射出灿烂光辉
    平壤盛会庆祝我国庆和朝中友好月开幕
    朴正爱郭沫若同声警告美国应停止挑衅
    新华社平壤30日电　平壤市各界人士今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场隆重集会，庆祝中华人民共和国成立九周年，并且举行“朝中友好月”开幕典礼。
    牡丹峰剧场的主席台上高悬金日成首相和毛泽东主席的画像。两旁插着十面朝中两国国旗。主席台正面悬挂着一行白色大字写着“朝中两国人民间牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！”
    晚七时，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府领导人同中国人民代表团团长郭沫若、副团长甘泗淇等登上主席台。这时全场响起春雷般的掌声。
    参加今天的大会的有朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹、金一、郑一龙、南日、郑准泽，朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱、金昌满等领导人以及各民主政党、社会团体负责人，人民军高级将领和各界著名人士。
    中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和使馆人员、由中国人民志愿军政治委员王平上将率领的志愿军代表团都应邀参加了大会。各兄弟国家驻朝鲜的使节也参加了大会。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱在大会上作了报告。她首先代表朝鲜劳动党中央、共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民热烈祝贺中华人民共和国的国庆。她并且对以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团表示热烈欢迎。
    朴正爱说，中华人民共和国在建设社会主义的事业中取得了巨大的成就。中国人民正在最短的时间内赶上资本主义国家一百年到二百年所达到的水平。她详细地谈到了中国人民在大跃进中在工农业生产方面所取得的成就。她说，今天，中华人民共和国已经成为社会主义的强国，为远东和世界和平作出了巨大贡献。我们以有这样的邻邦而感到自豪。
    朴正爱说，朝中两国人民的友谊团结是通过各种考验而巩固和发展起来的。在朝鲜祖国解放战争中，中国人民派来了志愿军，同朝鲜人民一道打败了美帝国主义者，对维护远东和世界和平作出了巨大贡献。中国人民在朝鲜战争以后的恢复建设时期，援助了朝鲜人民。最近在北京签订的两国长期贸易协定将有助于促进两国的社会主义建设，特别是中国给予朝鲜的长期贷款，是中国人民援助朝鲜人民的又一个表现。
    朴正爱谴责了美帝国主义在台湾海峡向中国人民进行军事挑衅的侵略行为。他说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已经发表声明支持中国人民的正义斗争。她说，美帝国主义者不顾中国人民和全世界人民的多次警告，加紧进行军事挑衅，在24日指使蒋介石集团使用导弹武器进攻中国大陆。她说，美帝国主义如果不停止这种行为，必将遭到更加沉重的失败。
    朴正爱说，朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义者的斗争中永远同中国人民并肩前进，并且要进一步加强同中国人民的紧密团结。
    朴正爱说，共和国内阁为了进一步加强朝中两国人民的传统友谊，决定以今年十月为“朝中友好月”。她说，我荣幸地宣布这一友好月的开幕。这时全场响起热烈的经久不息的掌声。
    郭沫若团长在热烈的掌声中向大会讲话。他的每一段话都博得热烈的掌声。
    他在讲话中一再说到了中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊。他说，这种友谊是无产阶级国际主义的典范，它在人类历史上将永远放射出灿烂的光辉。
    郭沫若团长在讲话中指出，“朝中友好月”的举行，是英雄的朝鲜人民对于中国人民的深厚友谊的进一步表现。他说，我们代表全中国六亿五千万人民向发起“朝中友好月”的朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和金日成首相致以崇高的敬意和真诚的感谢。
    郭沫若在讲话中谴责美帝国主义者目前在中国台湾地区对中国人民进行肆无忌惮的军事挑衅和战争威胁，十分粗暴地干涉中国内政，阻挠中国人民解放自己的岛屿金门、马祖和台湾。他着重指出了美国战争狂人最近指使蒋贼飞机在世界战争史上第一次使用导弹的滔天罪行。他说，美国在加紧把台湾变为进攻中国大陆的军事基地的同时，却又利用华沙中美大使级会谈，玩弄叫我们“停火”的把戏。他说，是美国自己在玩火，而它却要我们“停火”。这是叫我们为它的武力所胁服，默认美国侵占我们的领土。这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们倒要向美国侵略者大喝一声：你应该停止玩火，并且停止你的原子讹诈政策吧，赶快从台湾海峡滚出去！我们相信：有着广大的社会主义阵营的兄弟国家同我们站在一起，有着全世界爱好和平的人民同我们站在一起，美帝国主义对中朝两国的任何战争挑衅都将遭到更为可耻的失败。
    接着，郭沫若以中国人民代表团的名义向朝鲜人民献旗，金一副首相受旗。在这幅巨大的红旗上绣着一首金色字体的诗：“戳穿纸虎建丰功，统一江山在望中，国际精神传宇宙，朝鲜民族是英雄。”
    会后，正在平壤会演的朝鲜各道的艺术团体举行了联合演出。
