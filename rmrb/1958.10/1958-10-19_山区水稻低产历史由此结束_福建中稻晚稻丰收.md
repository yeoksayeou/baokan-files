Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th. Fujian Province's 10.08 million mu of mid-season rice and late rice have begun to be harvested. In the mountainous areas of eastern Fujian, northern Fujian, and western Fujian, where the harvest season started earlier, by the 14th, 401,463 mu of mid-season rice and late rice had been harvested and stored. According to a survey of 211,510 mu, the average yield per mu reached 669 jin, which is 382 jin higher than the province's average yield per mu of mid-season rice and late rice last year.

Fujian Province, which is mostly mountainous, has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of both early rice and mid-season and late rice this year. The history of low rice yields in mountainous areas has come to an end. This spring, the people in mountainous areas swept away the "backwardness theory" and "conditions theory" of mountainous areas, vigorously transformed cold paddy fields, iron rust paddy fields, and rotten mud paddy fields, and universally implemented dense planting and increased fertilizer application, enabling the high and cold terraced fields to achieve large-scale bumper harvests. In Nanping Prefecture, the 230,000 mu of mid-season rice and late rice that have been harvested, including 200,000 mu that have been inspected and weighed, have an average yield of 700 jin per mu, doubling the prefecture's yield per mu last year. In the Fu'an Prefecture, 32% of the mid-season and late rice yields are above 500 jin per mu, an increase of 90% compared to last year; in Minhou County, 8,000 mu of the 40,000 mu of mid-season rice have been harvested, with yields increasing by about two times compared to last year. The late rice experimental field of 1.03 mu planted by the First Battalion of the Youth Production Military Corps of the Red Flag Commune in Jianyang County achieved a yield of 15,900 jin per mu. In Shouning County, where "there is no three li of flat land," the average yield of 5,000 mu of mid-season rice reached 1,028 jin per mu, an increase of more than two times compared to the county's mid-season rice yield last year.

    山区水稻低产历史由此结束
    福建中稻晚稻丰收
    新华社福州17日电　福建省一千零八十万亩中稻、晚稻已开镰收割。收获季节较早的闽东、闽北、闽西山区，到14日止，已有四十万一千四百六十三亩中稻、晚稻登场入仓，据二十一万一千五百一十亩的调查，平均亩产达到六百六十九斤，这比去年全省中稻、晚稻亩产量高出三百八十二斤。
    多山的福建省今年早稻和中稻、晚稻都获得了空前的大丰收，山区水稻一向低产的历史由此结束了。山区人民今春一扫山区“落后论”和“条件论”，大力改造了冷水田、铁锈田和烂泥田，普遍作到密植和多施肥料，使那些山高水冷的梯田都赢得大面积丰收。南平专区已收割的二十三万亩中稻、晚稻，其中验收过秤的二十万亩，平均亩产达到七百斤，比去年这个专区亩产量翻了一番。福安专区32％的中稻、晚稻亩产量在五百斤以上，比去年增产90％；闽侯县四万亩中稻已收八千亩，产量比去年增产两倍左右。建阳县红旗公社青年生产军事团一营所种的一点零三亩晚稻试验田，亩产达一万五千九百斤。“地无三里平”的寿宁县，五千亩中稻平均亩产一千零二十八斤，比这个县去年中稻亩产量增产两倍还多。
