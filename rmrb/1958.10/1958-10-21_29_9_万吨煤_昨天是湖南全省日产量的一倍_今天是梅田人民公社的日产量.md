    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th: The Meitian People's Commune in Yizhang County, Hunan Province, launched a "satellite" on the 18th with a daily output of 299,135 tons of raw coal. It has raised the highest red flag among coal mining units in the province, exceeding the total raw coal output of the entire province on the 17th by more than double.
    On the 18th, the Meitian People's Commune mobilized more than 15,000 commune members to work hard day and night, opening hundreds of small coal kilns and five open-pit coal mines. Wang Qunsheng, the first secretary of the Yizhang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, led six county committee members and formed a command headquarters with the four commune party committee secretaries, commanding the battle on the construction site day and night. To support this battle, kindergartens, public canteens, and supply and marketing cooperatives were all moved to the construction site. Huang Jialin, an old commune member in his sixties, also happily led his entire family to the mountains overnight to cut pit props, cutting until dawn, and then rushed to the construction site to dig coal. While working, the old man sang a mountain song: "There are many stars in the sky, and many workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ground. The broad masses of workers and peasants are carrying out the Great Leap Forward, with thousands of hearts, tens of thousands of hearts, everyone working to launch satellites." As he sang, the surrounding masses joined in the singing. The construction site was filled with the sounds of hoes and singing. (Attached picture)

    29.9万吨煤
    昨天是湖南全省日产量的一倍
    今天是梅田人民公社的日产量
    据新华社长沙19日电　湖南省宜章县梅田人民公社，18日发射了日产原煤二十九万九千一百三十五吨的“卫星”，在全省采煤单位中树起了最高的红旗，超过全省17日原煤总产量的一倍多。
    18日这一天，梅田人民公社发动了一万五千多名社员，苦战一天一夜，开了几百座小煤窑和五座露天煤矿。中共宜章县委第一书记王群生率领六个县委委员，同公社四个党委书记一起组成了指挥部，日夜在工地指挥作战。为了支援这场战斗，幼儿园、公共食堂、供销社都搬到了工地。六十多岁的老社员黄家林，也喜冲冲地带领全家老小连夜到山上去砍坑木，一直砍到天亮，又赶到工地挖起煤来。这位老人边工作，边唱山歌：“天上多的是星星，地下多的是工农兵，广大工农搞跃进，千条心，万条心，人人为了放卫星。”他一唱，周围群众也和着唱。使工地上锄头飞舞，歌声飘扬。（附图片）
