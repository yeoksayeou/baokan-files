Achieving Mechanized Construction with Indigenous Methods
    Harbin No. 2 Construction Company Builds a Large Building in Four and a Half Days

    (Our report) The Harbin No. 2 Construction Engineering Company, by employing indigenous methods to achieve mechanized construction, erected a three-story building in four and a half days. This provides a new direction for prefabricated rapid construction that can be promoted among the vast majority of construction enterprises in our country that do not have Western-style hoisting machinery.
    The main hoisting construction machinery of this indigenous method, called a cableway crane, was created by Tang Guoxi, a scaffolder who only had two and a half years of schooling. Other supporting indigenous cranes include wooden Young Pioneer cranes. This cableway crane is composed of winches, pulleys, steel cables, etc., which are generally owned by Chinese construction enterprises. It is very efficient, and can lift prefabricated large wall sections and stairs weighing more than one and a half tons each time. If the steel cable is thickened, it can lift steel beams and columns weighing more than five tons. It only takes three minutes to install a large block. Therefore, as long as the interior plastering of the house is well coordinated, the construction period for a building with an area of 1,080 square meters can be shortened to three days. This indigenous hoisting construction machinery is suitable for hoisting steel structure workshops and also for hoisting buildings of three stories or more.
    After Harbin promoted the rapid construction method in April, creating a new record of building a three-story building in eighteen days, construction workers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places actively promoted and improved it. After the Beijing No. 4 Engineering Company created the experience of building a four-story building in eight days, the Harbin No. 2 Construction Engineering Company discovered that Beijing's experience mainly used Western-style cranes and other construction machinery to implement prefabricated construction. However, this engineering company currently does not have this equipment.
    Could we use indigenous methods to achieve mechanized hoisting construction? The Party organization issued a call to the workers to build a new building entirely with indigenous hoisting methods. And actively supported Tang Guoxi and others to improve the tools so that the project was completed in four and a half days. This building is not only more than ten times faster than general construction methods in the past, but also reduces the cost by more than 20% and saves nearly half of the wood and cement.

    用土办法实现机械化施工
    哈尔滨第二建筑公司四天半建成一座大楼
    本报讯　哈尔滨第二建筑工程公司采用土办法实现施工机械化，四天半盖成了一幢三层大楼，给我国绝大部分没有洋式吊装机械的建筑企业提供了可以推行的装配式快速施工的新方向。
    这个土办法的主要吊装施工机械，名叫架空缆索起重机，是一个只念二年半书的架子工汤国玺创造的。其他配合的土吊车有木制的少先吊车。这种架空缆索起重机是用我国一般建筑企业都拥有的卷扬机、滑车、钢索等组成的。它的效率很高，每次可以吊起一吨半以上的预制好了的大块砌墙和楼梯，如果把钢索加粗，就可以吊装五吨以上的钢梁钢柱。每安装一块大型砌块只要三分钟。因此只要房屋内抹灰工程配合得好，建一幢面积一千零八十平方公尺的大楼，工期可以缩短到三天。这种土吊装施工机械可适用于吊装钢结构厂房，也适用于吊装三层以上的建筑物。
    哈尔滨市在4月间推行快速施工法，创造了十八天盖一幢三层大楼的新纪录以后，北京、上海等地的建筑工人积极进行推广和改进，北京市第四工程公司创造了八天盖成一幢四层大楼的经验后，哈尔滨第二建筑工程公司，发现北京的经验，主要是运用了洋式的吊车等施工机械实行装配式施工，可是，这个工程公司目前还没有这种设备。
    能不能采用土办法来实现吊装施工机械化呢？党组织向职工们提出了完全用土办法吊装新大楼的号召。并且积极支持汤国玺等改进工具使这个工程在四天半就全部竣工了。这座大楼不仅在速度上比过去一般施工方法快十多倍，而且将降低造价20％多，节约木材和水泥近一半。
