    Deeper, Even Deeper

    Some works written by literary and art workers for workers and peasants are not liked by workers and peasants, and even if they do watch them, they can only barely watch half of them.

    The reason is simple: the works are not short, but they lack emotion. Workers and peasants most want to see works depicting their real-life struggles. They want to absorb some spiritual food from the works to have more energy to build socialism. If you write about workers and peasants without worker-peasant emotion, no matter how much you write, it will rarely work!

    Example 1: The Ming Tombs Reservoir was built by everyone's voluntary labor. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao took time out of his busy schedule to work on it. Some cadres wrote about their feelings through participating in the labor, and everyone loved to read it. But there were such "writers" who went to the reservoir three or four times, talking to people for several hours at a time, wanting to know from the conversations: "What is the source of your such great energy?" After understanding a little bit, they rushed back to write articles. Unfortunately, they didn't even touch an iron shovel.

    Example 2: A certain young "writer" went to a factory for a short-term experience of life, and was very anxious, always wanting to understand a lot immediately. So he walked in and out of the office, looking through a lot of relevant materials that he wanted to know, and then talked to the workers, asking: "When you are creating, what are you thinking in your heart? What did you think?"... Therefore, he thought he knew a lot, and rushed back to write a big article.

    If writers want to write for workers and peasants, they must first have worker-peasant feelings. It must be known that the feelings of workers and peasants are not a single line, but are also extremely complex. Workers and peasants have their own loves and hates, their own present, and their own painful past.

    If you want to write good works for workers and peasants, unless you "honestly" go deep into life and study deeply, otherwise, no matter how much or how long you write, it is worthless.

    深入，再深入些
    有的文艺工作者为工农写的作品，工农不愿看，即便看也只能勉强看半截。
    原因很简单：作品倒是不短，但缺少感情。工农是最想看描写自己现实生活斗争的作品的。想饱饱地从作品中吸取些精神食粮，以便更有劲地来干社会主义。如果写工农没有工农感情，这样的作品，写的再多也很少能起作用！
    例子之一：十三陵水库，是大家义务劳动建成的，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席在千忙万忙中也抽时间来干，有的干部通过参加劳动，写出了自己的感受，人人爱看。但竟有这样的“作家”去水库达三、四次之多，找人谈话一谈就是好几个钟头，想从谈话中知道：“你们这样大的干劲，力量源泉是什么呢？”这样懂得了点滴，回来赶写文章。可惜的是自己连铁锨都没摸一下。
    例子之二：某青年“作家”下厂短期体验生活，情绪很急，老想马上懂得许多，于是在办公室走进走出，翻看许多自己要知道的有关材料，紧接着找工人谈话，问：“你搞创造时，心里怎么想的？想了些什么？”……于是乎，自认为知道了许多，赶回来大作文章。
    作家如愿为工农写东西，首先必须有工农感情。须知工农的感情，不是一条单线，也是极复杂的。工农有自己的爱和憎，有自己的如今，也有自己痛苦的过去。
    要想为工农写出好作品，除非“老老实实”地深入生活深入学习，否则，写的再多、再长也是没价值的。
