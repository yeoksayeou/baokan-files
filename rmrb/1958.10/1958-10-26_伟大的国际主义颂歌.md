A priceless letter—a letter of gratitude from the Korean people to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese people—was presented by Park Jung-ae, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, on behalf of the entire Korean people to Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, and General Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, at a rally held by all sectors of society in Hero City, Pyongyang, on the afternoon of the 24th to bid farewell to the returning Chinese People's Volunteers.

Amid thunderous applause, the letter was unfurled on the rostrum. It was a mother-of-pearl lacquer screen measuring 1.2 meters high and 2 meters wide. On the orange-red six-panel lacquer screen, Korean artisans meticulously inlaid the full text of the letter of gratitude using pure white shells from the East Sea. Illuminated by mercury lamps, each character emitted a pearl-like brilliance. This pure gold-like language is an ode to the most beautiful Sino-Korean friendship in the world. It was written in blood by the Chinese and Korean peoples in their common struggle and is the heartfelt voice of the Korean people's boundless love and trust for the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers.

Along with this letter, 228 signature books were presented to the Chinese people. A total of 6,847,439 Korean people signed the letter of gratitude. Opening the first signature book, bound in red silk, the first signature was that of Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people and the beloved friend of the Chinese people.

In the Korean people's signature campaign for the letter of gratitude, there were countless touching scenes and unforgettable stories. Workers engaged in production competitions signed beside their machines; farmers put on their traditional white robes to sign; eight-year-old Young Pioneers and eighty-year-old grandfathers signed together; demobilized disabled soldiers with empty right sleeves signed with their left hands. From Pyongyang to Wonsan, from Changjin Lake to Shangganling, people held rallies, read the letter of gratitude aloud, recalled the achievements of the Volunteers, and, with the feelings of bidding farewell to their own relatives, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, business people, men, women, old, and young, all signed the letter.

Each name is an ode to friendship. Cui Xiyan, a support-the-front model who fought alongside the Volunteers fifteen times on the snowy Changjin Lake front and destroyed seven American tanks with them, said after signing, "The internationalist spirit of the Chinese people and the Volunteers will always inspire us, giving me courage and strength whenever I encounter difficulties, as I remember them." Liu Mei, a "Volunteer Mother" who saved many wounded Volunteers, said, "We will never forget the blood and sweat that the Volunteers shed on our land. I didn't treat the Volunteers as a foreign army, but as my own children. I am proud to have such good children, and we are extremely happy to have a fraternal country like China."

Each name is a story of sharing life and death. Zhao Junlong, a model worker at the Pyongyang Textile Machinery Factory, touched his arm while signing and said, "During the war, American planes bombed and injured my arm. It was the Volunteer comrades who rescued me despite the bombing and fire and healed my wounds. I will use the hand that the Volunteers healed to work hard and complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule."

Each name is a vow. On the day the members of the Luo Shengjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Shuocang Village, Chengguan County, the place where the internationalist martyr Luo Shengjiao selflessly saved the Korean boy Cui Ying, signed the letter of gratitude, men, women, old, and young, dressed in festive attire, signed in front of the tomb of Martyr Luo Shengjiao. Cui Xian, Cui Ying's younger brother and captain of the Luo Shengjiao Youth Assault Team, said after signing, "We will live up to the name of Brother Luo Shengjiao. Our Youth Assault Team will learn from his spirit and build this poor mountainous area into a socialist paradise, striving to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland as soon as possible, to repay the Volunteers and Brother Luo Shengjiao."

Each name is a heart. Hong Shunfen, a young woman who sheltered two Volunteer soldiers in a critical situation during the war, said, "I am signing my name on the letter of gratitude and having the Volunteers take it back to China, so that it can be with the Chinese people, and our hearts will never be separated."

Ah! 6,847,439 names, representing the hearts of all the Korean people. This is the lofty honor that the Korean people have given to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers. It is a paean to proletarian internationalism, a manifestation of the Korean people's eternal friendship with the Chinese people, and an epic of the further consolidation and development of Sino-Korean friendship.

    伟大的国际主义颂歌
    新华社记者　王玉章　于逢源
    一封无比珍贵的书信——朝鲜人民给中国人民志愿军和中国人民的感谢信，24日下午在英雄城平壤市各界举行的欢送中国人民志愿军归国的大会上，由朝鲜劳动党中央委员会副委员长朴正爱代表全体朝鲜人民交给了中国人民代表团团长郭沫若和中国人民志愿军司令员杨勇上将。
    在暴风雨般的掌声中，这封信在主席台上展开了。这是一面高一点二公尺、宽二公尺的螺钿漆屏。在橙红色的六扇漆屏上，朝鲜的手工艺术家们，用东海的洁白的贝壳精心地镶嵌出感谢信的全文。在水银灯的照耀下，每个字都发出珍珠般的灿烂的光彩，这纯金般的语言，是世界上最美丽的中朝友谊的颂歌。这是中朝人民在共同斗争中用鲜血写成的，是朝鲜人民无比热爱和信赖中国人民和中国人民志愿军的心音。
    同这封信一起交给中国人民的，是二百二十八册签名簿。共有六百八十四万七千四百三十九位朝鲜人民在感谢信上面签了名。打开用红色绸缎装订的第一册签名簿，第一个签名的是朝鲜人民伟大的领袖、中国人民敬爱的朋友金日成。
    朝鲜人民在感谢信上签名的运动中，有着多少动人的场面和令人难忘的故事。正在进行生产竞赛的工人，就在机器旁边签名；农民们穿上传统的洁白的长袍来签名；八岁的红领巾和八十岁的爷爷一同签名；空着右袖管的复员残废军人用左手签名。从平壤到元山，从长津湖到上甘岭，人们举行集会，朗读感谢信，回忆志愿军的功绩，工农兵学商、男女老幼都怀着送别自己亲人的心情，在这封信上签上了名。
    一个名字一支友谊的颂歌。当年在风雪交加的长津湖前线同志愿军并肩作战十五次，并同志愿军一起打毁七辆美军坦克的支前模范崔希彦，他在签名以后说，中国人民和志愿军的国际主义精神永远鼓舞着我们，使我在遇到任何困难的时候，想起了他们就有了勇气和力量。曾救过许多志愿军伤员的“志愿军妈妈”柳梅说，我们永不会忘记志愿军在我们的土地上流下的血汗。我没有把志愿军当作外国军队，而把他们当作自己的亲儿女。我为有这样的好儿女而感到自豪，我们为有中国这样的兄弟国家而感到莫大的幸福。
    一个名字一个生死与共的故事。平壤纺织机械工厂模范工人赵俊龙，在签名的时候摸着自己的一条胳膊说，战时美国飞机炸伤了我的胳膊，是志愿军同志冒着轰炸和烈火救了我，并给我治好了伤。我要用志愿军给我治好的手努力工作，提前完成五年计划。
    一个名字一篇誓言。在国际主义烈士罗盛教舍身救出朝鲜少年崔?的地方——成川郡朔仓里罗盛教农业社的社员们，在感谢信上签名的这一天，男女老幼都穿上了节日的服装，在罗盛教烈士的墓前进行签名。崔?的弟弟、罗盛教青年突击队队长崔现签名后说，我们要不辜负罗盛教哥哥的名字，我们青年突击队学习他的精神，要把这个贫穷的山区建设成社会主义乐园，争取早日实现祖国的和平统一，来答谢志愿军和罗盛教哥哥。
    一个名字一颗心。战争时期在危急的情况下掩护了两个志愿军战士的青年妇女洪顺粉说，我把名字签在感谢信上，由志愿军带回中国去，让它同中国人民在一起，我们的心永不分离。
    啊！六百八十四万七千四百三十九个名字，代表着全朝鲜人民的心。这是朝鲜人民给予中国人民和中国人民志愿军的崇高的荣誉，是一首无产阶级国际主义的赞歌，是朝鲜人民永远同中国人民友好的表现，也是中朝友谊进一步巩固发展的史诗。（附图片）
