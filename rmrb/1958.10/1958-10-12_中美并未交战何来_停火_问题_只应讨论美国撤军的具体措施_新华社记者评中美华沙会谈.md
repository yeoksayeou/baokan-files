Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, October 10th. This reporter reports: The Chinese and American ambassadors held a two-and-a-half-hour meeting here today. When they left the Myśliwiecki Palace, neither of them provided any indication that the talks had made progress.

Following recent developments—including numerous public statements issued by the Chinese and American governments and the Chinese Defense Minister's proclamation calling on the Taiwan authorities to hold peaceful negotiations to resolve their internal affairs—the positions taken by the two countries now appear clearer than ever. The Chinese government has made it very clear that they are willing to resolve China's internal issues directly with the Taiwan authorities. The Chinese government is only prepared to discuss specific measures with the Americans for the withdrawal of all American troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, because American aggression is the sole cause of the tense situation in the Far East, and discussing the withdrawal of American aggressive troops is the only purpose of the Sino-American talks.

The crux of the matter now clearly lies in the fact that the American government, on the one hand, continues its acts of aggression and interference in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and on the other hand, still insists on imposing its "ceasefire" conspiracy—which is based on continued American aggression and interference in China's internal affairs—on the other party. This "ceasefire" itself is a violation of China's sovereignty, enabling American aggressive troops to continue to remain on Chinese territory, expand its aggression, and create "two Chinas."

The United States has been using every means to interfere in China's internal affairs. It is very clear that the Chinese Defense Minister's order for a temporary halt to the shelling of Jinmen for humanitarian reasons, so that the military and civilians in Jinmen could receive supplies, and the proposal to hold negotiations with the Taiwan authorities, are purely internal matters for China. However, the United States immediately seized upon this, and nonsensically claimed that the cessation of shelling was an agreement to the American-proposed "ceasefire," even though the Chinese government had firmly denied that the suspension of shelling had anything to do with a "ceasefire." Furthermore, the United States has been trying its best to extend its so-called "ceasefire," and has threatened that if the Chinese government shells Jinmen again, it will resume "escort" operations. There is no action more blatant than this naked American interference and aggression.

In the eyes of the public, the American attitude has become increasingly absurd. In Warsaw, where the Sino-American talks are being held, ordinary people—Poles and foreigners—are constantly raising simple questions to the United States that the United States cannot answer.

They ask, if, as the United States also agrees, there is no war between the United States and China, how can there be a question of a "ceasefire"?

If the "ceasefire" issue only exists between the Chinese government and the Taiwan local authorities, then why should the United States interfere in this internal affair of China?

American government leaders have recently talked about so-called arrangements for resolving the Jinmen and Mazu issue, such as reducing the number of troops stationed by the Chiang Kai-shek group. People want to ask, who has appointed the Americans to negotiate these issues?

What right does the United States have to negotiate issues on Chinese territories such as Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu? Obviously, the Chiang Kai-shek group has not appointed the Americans to represent them, because until the time of writing this report, Chiang Kai-shek has been fundamentally opposed to the Warsaw talks. If it is said that the Chiang Kai-shek group has authorized the Americans to represent them in negotiations, that would be the greatest farce in diplomatic history, and it would immediately further prove that the Chiang Kai-shek group is merely a puppet supported by the United States to carry out aggression. At the same time, the Chinese government has made it clear that even if the Chiang Kai-shek group appoints the Americans to represent them, China will never recognize it.

The United States is still denying that it has any aggressive intentions, but people are asking, why are American troops concentrated on Chinese territory in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, why are American air and naval forces repeatedly intruding into Chinese territorial waters and airspace, why did American warships escort supply ships to Jinmen in the past and are still threatening to escort them, and why are American troops constantly carrying out war threats in the coastal areas of China every day?

The United States insists that Taiwan is not Chinese territory. People ask, how can the American government violate its own statement made by Truman in his capacity as President of the United States, declaring that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory?

How can the United States tear up the solemn declarations it signed in Cairo and Potsdam, confirming that Taiwan is Chinese territory?

People still hope that the Warsaw talks can find a solution to ease the tense situation in the Far East. At the same time, people are demanding that the United States immediately stop playing with fire, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and sit down to negotiate specific measures for the withdrawal of all American troops from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

    中美并未交战何来“停火”问题
    只应讨论美国撤军的具体措施
    新华社记者评中美华沙会谈
    新华社华沙10日电　本社记者报道：中美两国大使今天在这里举行了两个半小时会议，他们离开梅希里维茨基宫的时候都没有提供说明会谈获得进展的任何迹象。
    在发生最近的一些情况——包括中美两国政府发表的许多公开声明和中国国防部长关于号召台湾当局举行和平谈判来解决自己的内政问题的文告——以后，现在两国所采取的态度显得比过去任何时候都更加清楚了。中国政府已经非常清楚地表明，他们愿意同台湾当局直接解决中国的内部问题。中国政府只准备同美国人讨论所有美国军队撤出台湾和台湾海峡的具体措施，因为美国的侵略是造成远东紧张局势的唯一原因，讨论美国侵略军队撤退问题是中美会谈的唯一目的。
    现在问题的症结显然在于，美国政府一方面在台湾和台湾海峡继续进行侵略和干涉活动，另一方面仍然坚持要把它们的以美国继续进行侵略和干涉中国内政为基础的“停火”阴谋强加于对方。这种“停火”的本身就是侵犯中国的主权，使得美国侵略军队能够继续留在中国的领土上，扩大它的侵略，并且制造“两个中国”。
    美国一直利用一切办法来干涉中国的内政。事情十分清楚，中国国防部长为了人道主义下令暂时停止炮击金门，以便金门军民能得到物资供应，并建议同台湾当局举行谈判，这纯粹是中国的内政问题。但是，美国却立即抓住这一点，并且瞎说什么，停止炮击是同意美国提出的“停火”的建议，尽管中国政府已经断然否认暂停炮击同“停火”有任何关系。此外，美国还竭力要求延长他们的所谓“停火”，并且扬言，如果中国政府再次炮击金门，它就要恢复“护航”活动。再没有比美国这种赤裸裸的干涉和侵略行动更加粗暴的了。
    在公众的心目中，美国的态度已经变得越来越荒唐。在举行中美会谈的华沙，普通的人民——波兰人和外国人——都不断地向美国提出一些美国所不能回答的简单问题。
    他们问道，如果说像美国也同意的那样，美国同中国之间没有战争，怎么能够产生“停火”的问题呢？
    如果“停火”问题仅存在于中国政府同台湾地方当局之间，那么美国为什么要干涉中国这个内政问题呢？
    美国政府领导人最近曾谈到所谓解决金门和马祖问题的安排，如减少蒋介石集团驻军等。人们要问，是谁委派美国人来谈判这些问题的呢？
    美国人有什么权力来谈判像台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖等中国领土上的问题呢？显然，蒋介石集团并没有委派美国人做代表，因为直到写这篇报道的时候，蒋介石一直是根本反对华沙会谈的。如说蒋介石集团曾经授权美国人代表他们来谈判，那也将是外交史上最大的一幕滑稽剧，那将马上更加证明蒋介石集团只不过是美国为了遂行侵略而扶持的傀儡而已。同时，中国政府已经清楚地表明，即使蒋介石集团委派美国人做代表，中国也是决不会承认的。
    美国还在否认它有任何侵略的意图，但是人们都在问，为什么美国军队要集结在中国领土台湾和台湾海峡，为什么美国海空军一再侵入中国领海和领空，为什么美国军舰过去护送供应船只到金门去而且仍然扬言还要护送，为什么美国军队每天不断在中国沿海一带进行战争威胁？
    美国硬说台湾不是中国的领土。人们问道，美国政府怎么能够违背杜鲁门曾经以美国总统的身份所发表的宣布台湾是中国领土的一部分这个美国自己的声明呢？
    美国怎么能够撕碎它在开罗和波茨坦所签订的确认台湾是中国领土的庄严宣言呢？
    人们仍然希望华沙会谈能够找出缓和远东紧张局势的解决办法，同时人们都在要求美国立即停止玩火，停止干涉中国内政，坐下来谈判一切美国军队撤出台湾和台湾海峡的具体措施。
