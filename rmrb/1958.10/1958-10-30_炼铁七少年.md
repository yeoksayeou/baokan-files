	The Seven Iron-Smelting Youths
	Many heroes by the steel furnace, among the heroes are youths.
	In the Fifth Production Team of the Futian People's Commune in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, there are seven iron-smelting youths. The two leaders are named Liu Peiyan and Liu Bingsheng. They built a small iron-smelting furnace out of bricks and mud, and from September 25th, they have been smelting iron every night. They can produce thirteen catties of iron in five hours.
	The oldest of these seven youths is sixteen years old, and the youngest is eleven years old. During the period of intense agricultural production in April this year, they had organized to raise fish, accumulate fertilizer, and grow vegetables. When the nationwide steel smelting movement was launched, they decided to start an iron-smelting plant. Using their spare time, they picked up some broken bricks, dug some sticky mud, and in three nights, they built an iron-smelting furnace in Liujiawan. Then, they went up the mountain to mine ore, cut firewood, and picked up some charcoal and coke from the slag of the Futian Iron Plant's blast furnace, and made a bellows out of bamboo tubes. When the furnace dried on the evening of September 25th, they started production. Since then, they have been smelting a furnace of iron every night.
	The blazing furnace fire has not only smelted iron but also tempered these enthusiastic young people.

    炼铁七少年
    钢铁炉旁英雄多，英雄当中有少年。
    在江西省萍乡县福田人民公社第五生产队里，有七个炼铁少年。为首的两个叫刘培燕和刘炳生。他们用砖和泥土建成了一座小炼铁炉，从9月25日起，每天晚上都炼铁。五个小时能出铁十三斤。
    这七个少年最大的是十六岁，最小的十一岁。他们在今年4月间农业生产紧张的时期，曾经组织起来养鱼，积肥，种蔬菜。当全民炼钢铁运动开展起来以后，他们又决定办个炼铁厂。利用课余时间，拾了一些断砖，挖了一些粘泥，三个晚上，他们就在刘家湾建了一个炼铁炉。接着，他们自己上山挖矿石，砍木柴，又从福田铁厂的高炉渣里拣来一些木炭和焦炭，用竹筒做了一个风箱。到9月25日晚上炉子干了的时候，就开炉生产了。以后，每晚都炼一炉铁。
    熊熊的炉火既炼了铁，又锻炼了这些热情的少年人。
