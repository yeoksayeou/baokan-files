    Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The first Ambassador of the Kingdom of Cambodia to China, Lan...? Te, accompanied by all the diplomatic officers of the embassy, presented his credentials to Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, this afternoon.
    Present were: Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council, Zhang Wenjin, Director of the Asian Department, and Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department.
    When presenting his credentials, Ambassador Lan...? Te delivered a speech, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.
    Ambassador Lan...? Te's speech: Mr. Chairman:
    I am very pleased to be able to present to Your Excellency today the credentials from His Majesty the King, appointing me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Cambodia to the People's Republic of China, with the consent of the Royal Government and yourself.
    It is a great honor for me to be selected by our King as the head of the diplomatic mission to your great friendly country, and to have been approved by your government. The ancient, friendly, and fraternal relations that have existed between the Kingdom of Cambodia and China for hundreds of years in our two countries' history, which were interrupted for a period due to the common turmoil suffered by our two countries, are today re-established and strengthened as never before due to our common desire to safeguard world peace together with all peace-loving people. It is for this purpose that His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk has not ceased visiting various parts of the world and establishing direct contact with the leaders of various countries, from the day he began and won the independence of the country by peaceful means.
    In the present circumstances, it is not without significance to emphasize once again the fact that the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's Republic of China have repeatedly expressed their complete agreement on the principles of peaceful coexistence and the right of all nations, regardless of size, to exist independently and freely. Our two governments have together expressed the wish that all countries should live together in friendship and peace, regardless of their political systems. Because we are convinced that pursuing a friendly policy towards all nations that respect our sovereignty and independence is an important factor in maintaining stability and peace.
    Please allow me, at this solemn moment of presenting my credentials, especially during the celebration of your National Day on October 1st, to express my sincere desire for the establishment of genuine and lasting peace throughout the world.
    At the same time, I take this opportunity, in the name of the King and Queen of Cambodia, in the name of the Royal Government headed by His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and in the name of the Khmer people, to reiterate our sincere gratitude for the assistance you have given to our country.
    As for myself, I can say to Mr. Chairman that I am particularly pleased to be able to cooperate effectively with the senior representatives of the People's Republic of China and to receive their kind attention in carrying out my mission.
    I warmly thank you for the high trust you have shown me, and I assure you that I will do my best to strengthen the friendly relations between our two countries.
    Finally, I have the honor to convey the best wishes of the King and Queen of Cambodia for your health and the prosperity of the Chinese people.
    Please allow me to follow them in expressing my most respectful wishes for your health and happiness.
    Vice Chairman Zhu De's reply: Mr. Ambassador:
    I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency, appointing you as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of Cambodia to the People's Republic of China, and I sincerely thank His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit of your country, Her Majesty the Queen, His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, and Your Excellency the Ambassador for their friendly congratulations to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The Chinese people and the Cambodian people have had friendly relations since very early times. In recent years, thanks to the joint efforts of the two countries, this traditional friendship has developed greatly under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. I am convinced that with the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and the recent friendly visit of Prime Minister Sihanouk to China once again, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be increasingly consolidated and developed.
    The Royal Government of Cambodia has consistently pursued a policy of peace and neutrality in international relations, and has made unremitting efforts to uphold the noble cause of peace in Asia and the world. The Cambodian government and the Cambodian people are working diligently to develop an independent national economy. There is no doubt that the Cambodian people, under the leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit, will achieve ever greater success in the great cause of building their own country.
    Mr. Ambassador, I warmly welcome Your Excellency to take office as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of Cambodia to the People's Republic of China. In your work to consolidate and develop friendly cooperation between China and Cambodia, you will receive the full support of the Government of the People's Republic of China.
    I wish your country prosperity, your people prosperity, and longevity to His Majesty King Norodom Suramarit and Her Majesty the Queen.
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The first Ambassador of the Kingdom of Cambodia to China, Lan...? Te, paid a courtesy call on Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai this afternoon. Present at the meeting were Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wenjin, and Director of the Protocol Department Yu Peiwen.

    柬埔寨王国首任驻华大使兰·?特
    向朱德副主席递交国书
    新华社30日讯　柬埔寨王国首任驻华大使兰·?特今天下午偕大使馆全体外交官员，向中华人民共和国副主席朱德递交国书。
    在场的有：国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅，亚洲司司长章文晋和礼宾司司长俞沛文。
    递交国书时，兰·?特大使致颂词，朱德副主席致答词。
    兰·?特大使的颂词主席先生：
    我很高兴今天能够向阁下递交国王陛下，在王国政府和你的同意之下，任命我担任柬埔寨驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    我被我国国王选派为驻伟大友邦的外交使团团长，并且得到了贵国政府的同意，这实在是我的很大的光荣。柬埔寨王国和中国在我们两国历史的数百年间所存在的古老的友好的和弟兄般的关系，在因我们两国共同遭受变乱而被中断一个时期之后，今天由于我们要同所有爱好和平的人民一道维护世界和平的共同愿望而重新得到了建立并且空前地加强，正是为了这个目的，诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下从他用和平的方法为国家独立而开始进行斗争并赢得独立之日起，一直没有停止在世界各地访问，同各国的领导人建立直接的联系。
    在目前的情况下再次强调以下的事实不是没有意义的，那就是，柬埔寨王国和中华人民共和国数次表示了它们对于和平共处的原则，和所有民族不论大小都有权独立和自由地生存一点，持有完全一致的看法。我们两国政府一起表达了以下的愿望，即所有的国家应该友好而和平地相处，不论它们的政治制度有何不同。因为我们确信，对所有尊重我们的主权和独立的民族执行友好政策，乃是保持稳定和和平的重要因素。
    请允许我在递交国书这个庄严的时刻，特别是在庆祝10月1日贵国国庆日的时候，表达我对在全世界建立真正的和持久的和平的热诚愿望。
    同时，我借此机会，以柬埔寨国王和王后陛下的名义，以诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下为首的王国政府的名义并以高棉人民的名义，向你重申我们对你们给予我国的援助表示诚挚的感谢。
    至于我个人，我可向主席先生说，我能够同中华人民共和国高级代表有效地进行合作并且能够在完成我的任务时得到他们的亲切的关怀，感到特别的高兴。
    我热烈地感谢你对我所表示的崇高的信任，并且向你保证，我将尽我最大的努力来加强我们两国之间的友好关系。
    最后，我很荣幸地转达柬埔寨国王和王后陛下为阁下的健康和中国人民的繁荣所表示的最良好的祝愿。
    请允许我追随他们为你的健康和幸福表示我最尊敬的祝愿。
    朱德副主席的答词大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受阁下递交的柬埔寨王国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下任命你为驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，并且衷心地感谢贵国国王陛下和王后陛下、西哈努克亲王殿下以及大使阁下对中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席的友好祝贺。
    中国人民和柬埔寨人民从很早的时候起就存在着友好的关系。近年来由于两国的共同努力，这种传统的友好关系，在和平共处五项原则的指导下，有了巨大的发展。我深信，随着两国正式外交关系的建立和不久以前西哈努克首相再一次对中国的友好访问，我们两国间的友好合作关系必将日益巩固和发展。
    柬埔寨王国政府在国际关系中一贯坚定地执行着和平中立政策，并为维护亚洲和世界和平的崇高事业进行不懈的努力。柬埔寨政府和柬埔寨人民正为发展独立的民族经济进行辛勤的劳动。毫无疑问，柬埔寨人民在贵国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下的领导下，在建设自己国家的伟大事业中，必将获得越来越大的成就。
    大使先生，我热烈地欢迎阁下出任柬埔寨王国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使。在你为巩固和发展中柬两国友好合作的工作中，你将得到中华人民共和国政府的充分支持。
    谨祝贵国繁荣，人民兴旺，贵国国王诺罗敦·苏拉玛里特陛下和王后陛下万寿无疆。
    新华社30日讯　柬埔寨王国首任驻华大使兰·?特今日下午拜会国务院总理周恩来。拜会时在座的有副总理兼外交部长陈毅，外交部亚洲司司长章文晋和礼宾司司长俞沛文。
