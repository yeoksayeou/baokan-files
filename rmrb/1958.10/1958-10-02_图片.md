    The marching contingent of 600,000 people was reviewed by Chairman Mao and other national leaders in front of Tiananmen Square. (Figure 9)
    Before the start of the mass parade, a grand military parade was held in Tiananmen Square. The valiant men and women of the People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force are ready to liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and liberate Taiwan, awaiting the orders of the motherland at any time. (Figure 8)
    The vast militia force also accepted the review with doubled spirits. While producing, they take up arms, ready at any moment to give the invaders a devastating blow. (Figure 3)
    In the workers' contingent, clear charts record the astonishing speed of the steel marshal's rapid advance. (Figure 1)
    Suburban farmers offer the festival with unprecedented bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products. (Figure 2)
