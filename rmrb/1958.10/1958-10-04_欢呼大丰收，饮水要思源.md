Celebrating the Great Harvest, Remember the Source of the Water
Sun Xiaocun

Autumn is the season of maturity. The overall picture of agricultural production has been determined. Now, 500 million farmers have opened a new page in the history of world agriculture. What could be more exhilarating than this? The great harvest means that socialist agriculture has triumphed over capitalist agriculture and the small-peasant economy. People have conquered nature, and Chinese farmers have taken their destiny into their own hands.

This year's great harvest is not an ordinary harvest, nor is it an accidental one. It is the most splendid victory of Chinese farmers in their struggle to conquer nature with the collective strength and strong will under the leadership of the Communist Party. This is a great victory, and the beginning of even greater victories.

In this moment of jubilation, recalling the past will make us cherish today's achievements even more. Let's not talk about the distant past, but just about the situation during the end of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. At that time, disasters occurred year after year, with vast stretches of land left barren. Major cities ate foreign rice, and textile mills used American cotton. The saying "establishing the country through agriculture" became the most bitter satire. After liberation, during the three-year period of national economic recovery, under the leadership of the Party, the situation improved year by year. By 1952, the output far exceeded that of the Kuomintang era.

Our agriculture and industry are advancing in mutual support and mutual competition. With an average of just over three mu of cultivated land per farmer, can the production from this limited land supply the country with sufficient grain and industrial raw materials? Can it improve the lives of farmers? The Party clearly pointed out that we should use all means to increase yield per unit area. However, the idea that "despite increasing yield per unit area, each farmer has an average of only a little over three mu of cultivated land," which is essentially the idea that production has reached its limit, dominated many people. They did not recognize that the same three mu of cultivated land cannot be compared between a socialist country and a capitalist country; the same three mu of cultivated land cannot be compared between individual farmers and collective farmers. Just as some people were feeling distressed, the inspiring National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) was announced. The targets of "400 jin, 500 jin, 800 jin" told people that production had not reached its limit, but that there was great potential, and much could be done on three mu of land. Then, the nationwide rectification campaign, the socialist debate, the great liberation of communist ideology, and the announcement of the general line for socialist construction, all concentratedly promoted the great leap forward in production. Thus, one after another, record-breaking high-yield "satellites" of wheat, early rice, mid-season rice, and corn soared into the sky. Large-area high-yield production emerged at the county level, the special zone level, and even the provincial level, which formed the unprecedented great harvest in agricultural production this year.

The characteristics of this year's great harvest are, first of all, the scale. The output of both grain and cotton has doubled compared to last year. Secondly, there are both "satellites" and large-area high-yield production, and the two are combined with each other. Thirdly, such a staggering harvest was achieved in many areas by overcoming serious natural disasters. Some places had not seen rain for more than 300 days, but still strived for a good harvest. Therefore, the farmers proudly said: "We are the Jade Emperor, we are the Dragon King!"

For several years, we have been thinking about how to take another leap forward from the national average of 600 jin of unprocessed grain per person per year. Unexpectedly, this year, we have leaped to more than 1,000 jin per person. This is a heart-stirring figure. Thinking about the past, we realize that such achievements have not come easily. Without the leadership of the Party, without the socialist system, without the selfless labor of collective farmers day and night, the great harvest would not have come to the human world. The farmers sing well: "The Party is the eyeball, the commune is the lifeline. Whoever dares to touch it, beware of your head!" In celebrating the great harvest, how to learn from the laboring people's spirit of loving the Party, loving socialism, and loving labor is something that everyone should think about.

    欢呼大丰收，饮水要思源
    孙晓村
    秋天是成熟的季节。农业生产上的大局，已确定了。现在，五亿农民打开了世界农业史的新的一页，还有什么事能比这更使人欣喜欲狂呢？大丰收意味着社会主义农业战胜资本主义农业和小农经济之后，人已胜天，中国农民已把命运掌握在自己手里。
    今年的大丰收不是寻常的丰收，也不是偶然的丰收，这是中国农民在共产党的领导下以集体的力量、坚强的意志在征服大自然的斗争中的最漂亮的一次胜仗。这是伟大的胜利，又是更大胜利的开端。
    在欢呼的时刻里，回想一下过去的情景，会更加珍重今天的成就的。远的且不说，就谈谈蒋介石反动统治末期的情况吧，那时候真是灾祸连年，赤地千里，各大城市吃的是洋米，各纱厂用的是美棉，“以农立国”这句话成为最辛辣的嘲讽。解放后，在三年的国民经济恢复时期中，在党的领导下，光景一年好似一年，到1952年，就把国民党时代的产量远远地抛在后面了。
    我们的农业和工业是在相互支援、相互竞赛中前进的。每个农民平均只有三亩多耕地，靠这有限的三亩多耕地的生产，能够供应国家以足够的粮食和工业原料吗？能够改善农民的生活吗？党明确地指出要用尽一切方法来提高单位面积产量。可是，“尽管提高单位面积产量，但每个农民平均的耕地面积只有三亩多”这个实质上是生产到顶的想法支配了很多人，他们不认识同样三亩耕地，在社会主义国家里和资本主义国家里是不能相提并论的；同样三亩耕地在个体农民手里和在集体农民手里又是不能相提并论的。正在有些人感到苦闷的时候，振奋人心的全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布了，“四百斤、五百斤、八百斤”的指标告诉人们生产不是已经到顶，而是大有奔头，三亩耕地上大有文章可做。接着，全民大整风、社会主义大辩论、共产主义思想大解放、社会主义建设总路线的公布，这一切集中地促进了生产上的大跃进。于是，小麦、早稻、中稻、玉米等打破世界纪录的大卫星一个接着一个飞上了天，以县为单位，以专区为单位、甚至以省为单位的大面积丰产也出现了，这就形成了今年农业生产上的史无前例的大丰收。
    今年大丰收的特点，首先在于大，粮食、棉花都比去年翻一番；其次在于既有卫星，又有大面积丰产，而且二者互相结合；第三在于这样惊人的丰收在很多地区是战胜了严重的自然灾害而取得的，有的地方竟至三百多天不下雨，但仍然争得丰收，所以农民自豪地说：“我们就是玉皇，我们就是龙王！”
    几年以来，我们朝思夕想如何从全国每人每年平均六百斤原粮再向前跃进一步，不料，就在今年，我们竟跃进到每人千斤以上。这是个令人心花怒放的数字，想一想过去，才知道这样成绩得来真是不容易的。没有党的领导，没有社会主义制度，没有集体农民的不分昼夜的忘我劳动，大丰收是不会光临人间的。农民唱得好：“党是眼珠子，社是命根子，谁敢碰一下，当心脑瓜子”。在欢呼大丰收的时候，如何学习劳动人民热爱党、热爱社会主义、热爱劳动的精神，是值得每个人想一想的。
