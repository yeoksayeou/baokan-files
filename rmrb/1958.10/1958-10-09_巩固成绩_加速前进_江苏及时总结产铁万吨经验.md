Consolidate Achievements, Accelerate Progress
Jiangsu Promptly Summarizes Experience of Producing 10,000 Tons of Iron

(Reported by this newspaper) After Jiangsu Province launched a high-yield "satellite" of producing 10,000 tons of pig iron per day, it promptly conducted a summary and evaluation at the furnace front, commending good furnaces, good people, and good deeds, summarizing advanced experiences, and striving for greater victories on the steel front.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China highly valued the political and economic significance of this satellite launch. Jiang Weiqing, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said that steelmaking and ironmaking first and foremost temper people. Only by tempering people into those with an iron will can we achieve high yields and abundant production of steel.

The second gain from this satellite launch was the acquisition of experience. Jiang Weiqing said that when Chairman Mao recently inspected Jiangsu, the Provincial Party Committee reported to the Chairman that steel production was characterized by six characters: "There is hope, but it is not simple." Chairman Mao said that these two sentences were correct and that two more characters should be added to make eight: "There is great hope, but it is not simple." Through this sudden attack, cadres and masses in Jiangsu had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instruction. Through this sudden attack, they saw which furnaces had long lifespans, which had short lifespans, which were well-built, and which were poorly built; what experiences and lessons were learned in operation? In preparatory work, which links were reasonable and tightly grasped, and which links were unreasonable and weak? As long as we conscientiously summarize the experiences and lessons of this sudden attack, promote successful practices, and overcome the weaknesses that have been exposed, we can consolidate and improve the results of the sudden attack movement.

Third, before this satellite launch, Jiangsu Province's highest daily pig iron production was only more than 1,400 tons. After the satellite launch, the daily production in the past few days has increased tenfold compared to the past. This shows that with one sudden attack, our production has leaped forward. If we consolidate and improve our existing achievements, then production can potentially shift from sudden attacks to regular production, from a lack of experience to experienced production, and from low production to high production.

Regarding the work in October, Comrade Jiang Weiqing said that October is a decisive month. Party organizations at all levels should focus on three basic issues: one is putting politics in command, one is organizing forces in an orderly manner and vigorously carrying out mass movements, and the other is technological revolution. Only by grasping these three basic issues can we improve output and quality, improve technical levels, reduce labor intensity, and ensure high-speed progress.

Currently, criticism, debate and evaluation are being carried out everywhere. The metallurgical department of the Xie Sheng Cloth Factory in Changzhou City has evaluated and selected more than 100 advanced individuals and three advanced teams. The No. 6 blast furnace with a volume of one cubic meter at the Nanjing Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory only used six refractory bricks at the three ventilation doors, with the rest being all red and blue bricks, burning bituminous coal, and using cold air, yet its lifespan lasted for eight days and nights, producing 8,800 kilograms of iron. After summary and evaluation, it has become a model for everyone to learn from. In the past, some people believed that earthen furnaces could be used for ironmaking, but foreign furnaces were essential for steelmaking. This criticism and debate also focused on resolving this issue. Cadres at the Wuxi Food Machinery Factory established the idea of "small, indigenous, and mass" during the debate. They immediately organized the masses to learn and experiment while working. In two days and nights, they used diesel drums to create a 0.5-ton indigenous converter, and in four days, they used indigenous iron to produce 30 large batches of molten steel.

### 巩固成绩  加速前进  江苏及时总结产铁万吨经验

    巩固成绩  加速前进
    江苏及时总结产铁万吨经验
    本报讯　江苏省在放出了日产万吨生铁的高产卫星之后，及时进行炉前总结评比，表扬好炉、好人、好事，总结先进经验，争取在钢铁战线上取得更大的胜利。
    中共江苏省委对这次大放卫星的政治意义和经济意义估计很高。省委书记江渭清说，炼钢炼铁，首先是炼了人。只有把人炼成有钢铁意志的人，才能达到钢铁高额丰产。
    这次放卫星的第二个收获是取得了经验。江渭清说，最近毛主席来江苏视察时，省委曾向主席汇报说钢铁生产是六个大字：“有希望，不简单”，毛主席说这两句话是对的，还要加两个字，变成八个字：“大有希望，并不简单”。通过这次突击，江苏的干部和群众对主席这个指示有了更为深切的体会。通过这次突击，看出了哪些炉子是寿命长的，哪些炉子是寿命短的，哪些炉子建得好，哪些炉子建得差；操作中有哪些经验和教训？在准备工作中，哪个环节是合理的、抓得紧的，哪个环节是不合理的、薄弱的。只要认真地把这次突击的经验教训总结一下，推广成功的做法，克服已经暴露出来的弱点，就能巩固和提高突击运动的成果。
    第三，在这次放卫星之前，江苏省生铁日产量最高只有一千四百多吨，放了卫星以后，这几天的日产量就比过去增长了十倍。这说明突击一次，我们的生产向前跃进了一步。如果我们把已有的成绩加以巩固和提高，那末生产就有可能从突击转到经常，从缺乏经验转到有经验，从低产转到高产。
    谈到10月份的工作，江渭清同志说，10月是决战性的一个月，各级党组织抓住三个基本问题：一个是政治挂帅，一个是有条不紊地组织力量、大搞群众运动。还有一个是技术革命。只有抓住了这三个基本问题才可以提高产量质量，提高技术水平，降低劳动强度，保证高速度前进。
    目前，各地都展开了鸣放评比。常州市协盛布厂冶炼部门评出一百多个先进人物和三个先进班。南京市农业机械修配厂一立方公尺的六号高炉，只在三个通风门处用了六块耐火砖，其他全是青红砖，吃烟煤，喝冷风，而寿命却烘到八昼夜，出铁八千八百公斤。经过总结评比，成为大家学习的榜样。过去，有些人认为炼铁用土炉还可以，炼钢却非用洋炉不可。这次鸣放辩论也着重解决这个问题。无锡市食品机械厂干部在辩论中，树立起“小、土、群”的思想。他们立即组织群众边学、边试验，在两昼夜内就用柴油桶搞成了一只0.5吨的土转炉，四天中用土铁炼出三十大炉钢水。
