Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today exposing the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to hastily tie Japan to the American war chariot and its militaristic essence.

It is reported that Nobusuke Kishi said to Cecil Brown, a Tokyo correspondent for NBC on October 9th, that Japan has "now reached the time to delete the clause renouncing war from the constitution. Because the constitution prohibits sending troops abroad, it must be amended." Nobusuke Kishi also issued slanderous and anti-communist remarks against China to this American reporter.

For this reason, the Socialist Party held an emergency meeting in Tokyo today and issued a statement saying that Nobusuke Kishi, who was a member of the Tojo Cabinet and a war criminal, has exposed his militaristic nature. Currently, the various reactionary policies adopted by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, such as amending the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" and many other policies, are interconnected. There is no doubt that these policies are designed to centralize national power to militarize Japan. The statement stated that the Socialist Party will struggle resolutely against Nobusuke Kishi's diplomatic and military policies that attempt to drag Japan into war, and will work with the Japanese people to crush Nobusuke Kishi's attempt.

The Socialist Party's statement said that Nobusuke Kishi was the first to blatantly declare, not to the Japanese people first, but to the United States, that he wanted to delete the clause renouncing war from the constitution in order to promote the large-scale rearmament of Japan, including nuclear armament, open a path for sending troops abroad, and sign a military treaty of mutual defense alliance with the United States, forming an anti-communist alliance between Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek.

The statement pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi is doing this to make Japan undertake a greater military mission in the US's anti-communist strategic system than it does now, and automatically pull chestnuts out of the fire for the United States. The Socialist Party believes that this is a very dangerous policy that not only cannot guarantee Japan's security, but will push Japan towards war.

The statement condemned Nobusuke Kishi's following the United States and his unscrupulous slander of China. The statement pointed out that Nobusuke Kishi particularly emphasized his non-recognition of China, and threatened to implement "cooperation" by Japan, Syngman Rhee, and Chiang Kai-shek to "prevent communist aggression." Nobusuke Kishi's approach will further adversely affect the work of improving Sino-Japanese relations and lead Japan down the same path as the notorious Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek anti-communist puppet regimes.

Nobusuke Kishi's blatant militaristic fallacy has aroused public outrage among the Japanese people. Therefore, Nobusuke Kishi met with reporters again at his official residence today to deny his conversation with Brown, saying that the content of the NBC broadcast had "many errors." He said he did not remember saying that he would delete Article 9 of the constitution (regarding the clause on renouncing war).

However, Nobusuke Kishi then said: "Personally, I advocate amending the constitution, including amending Article 9." He denied that his proposal to amend the constitution was related to this revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty". He said that the revision of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" will be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the current constitution.

When talking about the anti-communist alliance between Japan, Rhee, and Chiang, Nobusuke Kishi blatantly and arrogantly revealed his vicious face in opposing the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory - Taiwan, saying that he "does not want Taiwan to turn red." He said: "The redification of Taiwan and South Korea is a serious issue for Japan's domestic security."

Nobusuke Kishi also tried his best to support the United States' policy of aggression against China in the Taiwan Strait region. Although he admitted when meeting with reporters on the 15th that "the dispute in the Taiwan Strait is a domestic issue on the one hand, and an international issue on the other," he deliberately confused China's internal affair of liberating Taiwan, which is an exercise of sovereignty, with the US armed aggression against Chinese Taiwan, saying that he hoped that "the parties concerned will treat it as an international issue for talks."

### 公然要找门路派兵追随美国侵略  岸信介现出了军国主义原形  日本社会党表示一定要粉碎反动阴谋

    公然要找门路派兵追随美国侵略
    岸信介现出了军国主义原形
    日本社会党表示一定要粉碎反动阴谋
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，揭露岸信介政府急于把日本缚在美国战车上的阴谋和它的军国主义本质。
    据报道，岸信介曾经在10月9日对美国全国广播公司驻东京的记者塞西耳·布朗说，日本“现在已经到了从宪法里删去放弃战争的条款的时候了。因为宪法禁止派兵出国，所以必须加以修改。”岸信介还对这个美国记者再次发出了诬蔑中国和反共的谰言。
    为此，社会党今天在东京举行了紧急会议，并且发表声明说，曾经是东条内阁的阁员和战犯的岸信介已经暴露出他的军国主义者的本性。目前，岸信介内阁采取的各项反动政策，例如要修改“警察官职务执行法”和其他许多政策，是互相联系的，这些政策都是为了集中国家的权力来使日本军国主义化，这一点是不容怀疑的。声明表示，社会党将进行斗争，坚决反对岸信介企图把日本卷进战争中去的外交和军事政策，并且要同日本国民一起粉碎岸信介的企图。
    社会党的声明说，岸信介第一次明目张胆地，而且不是首先向日本国民，而是向美国表示要删去宪法中放弃战争的条款，以便推进包括核武装在内的大规模地重新武装日本的工作，开辟一条派兵出国的道路，并且要同美国签订攻守同盟性质的军事条约，结成日本、李承晚、蒋介石的反共同盟。
    声明指出，岸信介这样做就是要使日本在美国的反共战略体系中承担比现在更大的军事任务，自动地为美国火中取栗。社会党认为这是一种不仅不能保障日本的安全，反而会把日本推向战争的非常危险的政策。
    声明谴责岸信介追随美国和对中国进行肆无忌惮的诬蔑。声明指出，岸信介特别强调不承认中国这一点，并且扬言要由日本、李承晚、蒋介石实行“合作”来“防止共产主义侵略”。岸信介的这种做法将使改善日中关系的工作进一步受到不良的影响，使日本走上同臭名远扬的李承晚和蒋介石反共傀儡政权命运相同的道路。
    岸信介这次露骨的军国主义者的谬论引起了日本人民的公愤。于是，岸信介今天又在他的公馆接见记者，否认他向布朗的谈话，说是美国全国广播公司的广播内容“错误很多”。他说他不记得他曾经说过要删去宪法中第九条（关于放弃战争的条款）的话。
    但是，岸信介接着就说：“在我个人来说，我是主张修改宪法、并且包括对第九条的修改在内。”他否认他的修改宪法的主张同这次修改日美“安全条约”有关。他说，日美“安全条约”的修改，将按照现行宪法的规定进行。
    在谈到日、李、蒋反共同盟问题的时候，岸信介公然狂妄地表示出他反对中国人民解放自己领土——台湾的凶恶面目，说什么“不希望台湾赤化”。他说：“台湾和韩国的赤化，对日本国内治安来说，是一个严重问题。”
    岸信介还竭力为美国在台湾海峡地区对中国进行侵略的政策张目。他在15日在接见记者时虽然承认“台湾海峡的纠纷一方面是国内问题，另一方面也是国际问题”，但他却故意把中国解放台湾这一行使主权的中国内政问题同美国武装侵略中国台湾的问题混淆起来，说什么希望“有关的当事者把它当作国际问题来进行会谈”。
