    300,000-Strong Procurement Army Camps in Communes, Farmers Seize Time for Rush Sales and Transport
    A High Tide of Agricultural Product Procurement Forms in Jiangxi Province
    (Our Nanchang Dispatch, October 29) A massive high tide of rush procurement of agricultural products is sweeping Jiangxi Province. The province's 300,000-strong procurement army, carrying quilts and luggage, is camping in the people's communes. During the day, they labor alongside commune members, and during rest periods and in the evenings, they launch a rush to purchase large quantities of goods. As of the 22nd of this month, the Gannan Special District, which is making the fastest progress, has already completed more than 85% of this year's commodity procurement tasks. The total value of purchases throughout the province has reached 72.7% of the annual plan, with tea exceeding the target by 6%, live pigs reaching 91.63%, cotton reaching 63.4%, and ramie reaching 63.11%.
    Starting in August, relevant departments from the province to the special districts, counties, and townships, based on the characteristics of this year's heavy procurement tasks and many varieties, formulated procurement plans, organized forces, and launched procurement activities. During the procurement period, as the rural areas were engaged in the Great Leap Forward in Steel and intensive autumn harvesting and winter planting, some procurement staff emphasized the tense nature of rural work and felt that procurement activities could not be carried out. Some people also believed that since the state was carrying out unified procurement anyway, there was no need to rush. In order to firmly implement the policy of large-scale procurement, the relevant leading organs organized a large-scale airing of views and debates among commercial employees throughout the province on how to guarantee the completion of procurement tasks based on the characteristics of this year's commodity procurement. Commercial personnel in various places changed their previous practice of sitting in offices or holding meetings for procurement and moved to the people's communes with their luggage.
    In order to overcome the difficulties of lacking labor and tools for commodity transportation, the broad masses of procurement personnel relied on the Party committees and adopted the method of "five searches": searching for the elderly, searching for women, searching for office cadres, searching for urban residents, and searching for school students, mobilizing them to participate in the transportation of agricultural products. Because the procurement personnel ate, lived, and worked together with the commune members, adding labor to agricultural production, the commune members were also happy to voluntarily give up rest time to help with procurement and transportation. In Guangfeng County alone, more than 39,000 women, more than 25,000 students, and more than 1,000 residents transported more than 8.69 million jin of jute purchased by the state into warehouses in three hours. In Gan County, the "May 1st" and two other people's communes sold agricultural products worth more than 10,000 yuan to the state in one night. In Jiangkou District of this county, on October 15th, the teams transporting and selling agricultural products stretched from morning to late at night, and the live pigs, fresh eggs, fresh fish, and other goods sold and transported were worth more than 82,000 yuan.
    During the rush procurement, various places also adopted the methods of "four on-the-spots" (on-the-spot procurement, on-the-spot packaging, on-the-spot storage, on-the-spot transportation) and "three carries" (carrying tasks, carrying prices, carrying cash), which greatly facilitated the masses and improved procurement efficiency. Due to the adoption of this method, according to statistics, the province can save more than 3 million rural labor days.

### 三十万采购大军扎营公社  农民们抓紧时间突击售运  江西省采购农产品形成高潮

    三十万采购大军扎营公社  农民们抓紧时间突击售运
    江西省采购农产品形成高潮
    本报南昌29日电　江西省掀起声势浩大的突击采购农产品的高潮。全省三十万采购大军带着被子、行装，扎营在人民公社，白天同社员一起劳动，在休息时间和晚上突击大收大购。截至本月22日统计，进度最快的赣南专区已经完成今年商品收购任务85％以上。全省购进总值完成全年计划72.7％，其中茶叶超额完成6％，生猪完成91.63％，棉花完成63.4％，苎麻完成63.11％。
    8月份起，从省到专区、县、乡的有关部门，就根据今年收购任务重、品种多等特点，制定了收购规划，组织力量，展开收购活动。由于收购期间，正值农村大炼钢铁和紧张地进行秋收、冬种，某些收购工作人员便强调农村工作紧张，认为无法开展收购活动。有的人还认为现在反正是国家统一收购，不必着急。为了坚定不移地贯彻大收大购的方针，有关领导机关在全省商业职工中组织开展了如何根据今年商品收购的特点，保证完成收购任务的大鸣大放、大辩论。各地商业人员纷纷改变了往年蹲办公室或开大会收购的作风，背着行装住到人民公社。
    为了克服商品运送缺乏劳力、工具的困难，广大采购人员依靠党委，采取了“五找”的办法：找老年人，找妇女，找机关干部，找城镇居民，找学校学生，发动他们参加运送农产品。由于采购人员同社员同吃、同住、同劳动，为农业生产增加了劳动力，社员们也高兴地自动放弃休息时间，帮助收购和运送。仅广丰县就有三万九千多个妇女、二万五千多个学生、一千多个居民，在三个小时内把国家收购的八百六十九万多斤黄麻运进仓库。赣县“五一”等三个人民公社一晚上售给国家的农产品价值达一万多元。这个县江口区在10月15日这一天，从早上到深夜送售农产品的队伍络绎不绝，售运的生猪、鲜蛋、鲜鱼等价值八万二千多元。
    在突击收购中，各地还采取了四就（就地收购、就地包装、就地保管、就地运输）、三带（带任务、带价格、带现款）的办法，大大便利了群众，提高了收购效率。由于采取这种办法，据统计，全省可节省农村劳动日三百多万个。
