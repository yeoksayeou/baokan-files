Strive for a Mechanical Great Leap Forward
By Our Staff Commentator

    In the magnificent high tide of the iron and steel industry's leap forward, with steel as the key link, the machinery industry has also mounted a steed and is galloping forward. In the first nine months of this year, the machinery industry has launched bumper "satellites" in the production of metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, and machine tools. The output of these three aspects has not only far exceeded the production level of the entire last year but has generally completed more than 60% of this year's leap forward plan. This is a brilliant achievement obtained by the hard work of more than one million machinery industry workers and several million workers in other non-machinery industrial systems under the leadership of the Party.

    Party committees at all levels, using the mass movement method, are vigorously developing machinery, which is an important reason for the rapid development of the machinery industry. They deeply understand that to enable the great leap forward of industry, with steel as the key link, it is necessary to develop the machinery industry that provides equipment for various industries. Therefore, in August of this year, when Party committees at all levels shifted the focus of their leadership from agriculture to steel, they promptly paid attention to grasping the machinery industry. Party committees of various provinces and cities not only grasped the large-scale machinery industry in their jurisdictions but also grasped the small and medium-sized machinery industry, and not only grasped the machinery industry but also mobilized many repair shops, repair workshops, repair groups, machinery handicraft cooperatives, and the mechanical forces of various industrial schools in non-machinery systems to jointly manufacture metallurgical and power generation equipment and parts. Many provinces even organized the agricultural tool repair factories and repair stations in many counties and districts, as well as the blacksmiths and carpenters of the people's communes, to manufacture various simple indigenous machines and parts. This constitutes a magnificent picture of the whole Party and the whole people running machinery, enabling the machinery industry to spread its wings and fly. In September, the national production of blowers reached more than 12,000 units, more than doubling the total of the first eight months of this year, and the production of converters in September was equal to 276% of the total output of the first eight months. This once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's instruction that "large-scale mass movements should be carried out in the industrial field," and also powerfully refutes the doubters and onlookers who believe that "the machinery industry is too complicated and cannot engage in mass movements."

    Another reason for the rapid development of the machinery industry is that various localities have fully promoted the spirit of mutual cooperation and widely promoted the advanced experiences of "ants gnawing at bones" and "tea kettles boiling pig heads." Many sophisticated, complex, and large machines could not be handled by one factory, so several factories cooperated, manufacturing parts separately and then joining them together to quickly manufacture large machines. Some places lacked large machine tools, so they used small or indigenous machine tools, modified them, and divided the work to process various large parts. Like ants gnawing at bones, they gnawed out large parts one by one, and were able to manufacture large equipment. This is a remarkable initiative of China's machinery industry and an important experience in accelerating the development of the machinery industry.

    Although the machinery industry has achieved great results in the first nine months, it is still far from the annual plan. In this year's Great Leap Forward, steel, coal, electricity, transportation, agriculture, and other aspects have all put forward urgent requirements for the machinery industry. The vast number of machinery industry workers must not only resolutely guarantee the completion of the annual plan but also complete it ahead of schedule so that the equipment produced can play a role this year. Next year, the output of the machinery industry should be prepared to double several times. Whether it can be completed depends on the first quarter of next year, and the task of the first quarter of next year depends on whether the fourth quarter of this year can overcome difficulties and raise output to a high level. In the fourth quarter, we must not only grasp production but also grasp capital construction, especially the key machine factories in the country should receive priority support, which will be conducive to the great leap forward of capital construction. Half of next year's production tasks must be completed by new factories, and how various localities can independently solve the problem of equipment is also a problem that cannot be relaxed. When solving equipment problems, we should also pay attention to analyzing the situation and firmly grasp the work of prioritizing key factories. Therefore, the tasks facing the machinery industry workers are very arduous. At present, the most prominent and urgent problem facing the machinery industry is the supply of raw materials, which must be actively and promptly solved without delay. The first step is to do a good job in supply organization and obtain scattered and sporadic indigenous iron and steel. The second step is to quickly figure out how to consume indigenous iron and steel. Various localities should pay attention to the timely supply of steel and pig iron to machine manufacturing factories. More importantly, the machinery departments of various localities must do it themselves and try every means to smelt steel and iron themselves, competing with the peasant brothers in enthusiasm, which will not only have a positive effect on the growth of China's steel production but also play a huge role in promoting the leap forward of the machinery industry itself.

    To complete such arduous tasks, the machinery industry must rely on the efforts of the central machinery leadership departments, the strong support and cooperation of various relevant departments, and the joint efforts of Party committees at all levels. We firmly believe that as long as the whole Party and the whole people are mobilized to carry out large-scale mass movements in the machinery industry and vigorously engage in technical innovation, the machinery industry will surely release more beautiful and colorful flowers.

    力争机械大丰收
    本报评论员
    在波澜壮阔的以钢为纲的工业跃进高潮中，机械工业也跨上了骏马在向前飞奔。今年前九个月，机械工业在冶炼设备、发电设备和机床生产方面已放出了丰产“卫星”，这三方面的产量不但远远超过了去年全年的生产水平，而且一般都完成了今年跃进的计划60％以上。这是全国一百多万机械业职工和其他非机械工业系统几百万职工，在党的领导下勤奋苦战所获得的辉煌成果。
    各级党委用群众运动的方式，大搞机械，是机械工业能够飞跃发展的重要原因。他们深深懂得要使以钢为纲的工业大跃进，就必须要发展为各项工业提供设备的机械工业，因此，在今年8月当各级党委把领导重心从农业转到钢铁方面的时候，就及时注意抓了机械工业。各个省、市委不但抓了所辖地区的大型机械业，而且还抓了中小型机械业，不但抓了机械业，而且把许多非机械系统的修配厂、修配车间、修配小组，机械手工业合作社，以及各种工业学校的机械力量也都动员起来，一齐动手制造冶炼和发电等设备和机件。不少省甚至把许多县、区的农具修配厂和修配站，以及人民公社的铁、木匠也都组织起来，制造出各种简单的土机器和机件。这就构成了一幅全党全民办机械的壮丽图景，使得机械工业得以展翅飞翔。9月份全国生产鼓风机达一万二千多台，比今年前八个月的总和多了一倍多，9月份生产的转炉等于前八个月产量的总和的276％。这又一次证明了毛主席对“工业方面要搞大规模的群众运动”的指示的正确，也有力地驳斥了认为“机械工业太复杂，不能搞群众运动”的怀疑派和观潮派。
    机械工业能够飞跃发展的另一原因是，各地充分发扬了相互协作的精神，广泛地推行了“蚂蚁啃骨头”、“茶壶煮猪头”等先进经验。许多精密的复杂的大型机器，一个厂子吃不下来，就由几个厂分工协作，分别制造部件，再在一起合拢，就把大机器迅速地制造出来了。有的地方缺少大机床，就使用小机床或土机床，加以改装，分工对各种大部件进行加工，像蚂蚁啃骨头似的把大部件一个个啃出来，就能制成大型设备。这是我国机械工业的一件了不起的创举，是加速发展机械工业的一项重要经验。
    机械工业在前九个月中，虽然获得了很大成绩，但是比起全年计划来，仍相差甚远。在今年大跃进中，钢铁、煤、电、交通、农业等各个方面，都对机械工业提出了迫切的要求。机械工业广大职工不仅要坚决保证全年计划的完成，而且还要提前完成，这样才能使生产出来的设备，在今年里发挥出作用来。明年机械工业的产量要准备再翻上几番，能不能完成，关键在明年第一季度，而明年第一季度的任务又要看今年第四季度是否能够克服困难，把产量高高的提上去。在第四季度中，不仅要抓好生产，还要抓好基本建设，特别是全国的重点的机器工厂更应得到优先的支持、才有利于基本建设的大跃进。明年的生产任务一半要靠新厂来完成，各地如何自力更生的解决设备也是一个不可放松的问题。在解决设备时还应当注意分析情况，紧紧地掌握对重点厂的排队工作。因此，摆在机械工业职工面前的任务，是十分艰巨的。而当前，机械工业面临着的最突出最急迫的是原材料供应问题，绝不能等待，必须要积极从速设法解决。第一步要做好供应组织工作，把分散零星的土铁、土钢拿到手；第二步就要赶快想办法如何把土铁、土钢吃下去。各地要注意及时供应机器制造工厂的钢材与生铁。更重要的是，各地机械部门要自己动手，想尽一切办法自己来炼钢、炼铁，与农民兄弟比干劲，这不仅对我国钢铁生产的增长有着积极的作用，而且对机械工业本身的跃进也将起着巨大促进作用。
    机械工业要完成这样繁重的任务，除了依靠中央机械领导部门的努力，依靠各有关部门的大力支援配合外，仍然必须依靠各级党委的共同努力。我们坚信，只要全党全民动员起来，在机械工业方面开展起大规模的群众运动，大闹技术革新，机械工业必定会放出更加鲜艳美丽的花朵。
