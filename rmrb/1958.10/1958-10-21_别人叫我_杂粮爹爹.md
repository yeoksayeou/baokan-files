    Others Call Me "Coarse Grain Grandpa"
    Wang Yongxia, member of a commune in Dengta Township, Echeng, Hubei
    I am already sixty-four years old. Because I planted some coarse grains on the ridges of the fields, I can probably harvest more than 20,000 jin. Others call me "Coarse Grain Grandpa," and the village where I live is called "Sorghum City."
    In the spring, Chairman Mao called for a Great Leap Forward, and everyone wanted to achieve high yields. Even little girls wanted to compete to be cotton girls. I can't be considered old. The team asked me to herd cattle, but I still wanted to do something important, to plant coarse grains on the ridges of the fields. My mother-in-law said, "Why bother yourself at such an old age?" The next day, I ran into Wang Chunshan, but he said the same thing as my mother-in-law: "You won't be happy. Since you started herding cattle for the landlord at the age of thirteen, you've been a farmhand for more than thirty years. Haven't you worked enough? Even if you don't work, the commune will still support you." I didn't like hearing that. He's already in his fifties and has a beard, but he's too lazy to even pick up a four-ounce oil lamp. It's useless to talk to him.
    I simply went to the captain. I said I wanted to plant coarse grains on the ridges of the fields. One ridge of the field could produce ten jin of grain. Seventy-eight ridges would be seven or eight hundred jin of coarse grains. During the New Year and festivals, the adults and children in the village would have sorghum cakes to eat. He said, "The Party calls for寸土必争[cun tu bi zheng - contending for every inch of land], this is a good idea. We'll send people to do it tomorrow. You've been a model cattle herder for two years, why change professions?" He also said, "Are you afraid the commune won't take care of you?" I got anxious: "A rooster only has four ounces of strength, but if I have a little strength, I want to put it to use. How can I feel good about just sitting around and eating? If you don't agree, I'll bring the cattle and tether them in your main room." The captain let me win the argument, and allocated thirty of the seventy-eight ridges to me.
    I planted broad beans and soybeans on the ridges, and I also planned to plant some sorghum. The team didn't have any sorghum seeds. I said to the captain, "If each family takes out a spoonful, there will be enough." Some people took them out, but some people pushed back and forth, and some even scolded me, "Thinking of harming people, not even sparing a little sorghum seed." I said, "Planting sorghum is for the commune. I'm not building a private stash. If there's a good harvest, won't everyone eat?"
    The seeds were planted, and the seedlings grew strong, but they lacked fertilizer. By myself, I accumulated three or four thousand jin of manure in two or three months. The deputy director of the commune was an enthusiastic person, and he helped me collect a lot of chicken and duck manure. My heart grew bigger and bigger. I planned to plant all seventy-eight ridges. Some people said, "Such a big heart, let's see if you can contend for flowers and fruits." A young man from the lower village named Wang Youhua came to me and said, "Relying on you to produce will starve people to death, unless grain falls from the sky." I thought, looking down on me, can you support the sky by yourself? If one person puts in four ounces of effort, a hundred people is four hundred ounces. Even the edges of the fields are still soil, and shouldn't be wasted. Every grain harvested is a grain. Young people can't calculate detailed accounts. Thinking of this, I teased him a few times: "You rely on large fields and large plots for high yields, and I rely on the edges of the fields you've abandoned for high yields. Don't be afraid of you being young, the grain I harvest will be more than yours."
    Just as the rice seedlings were branching out, some suddenly died. Someone told me that they had worms. I crawled on the ground, digging along the seedlings with my fingernails, and indeed dug out worms, as big as silkworms. These were cutworms. Whether they're heaven tigers or earth tigers, if you harm my seedlings, I'll take your life. I caught them one by one for more than four days, and finally caught all the worms.
    The heavens also worked against me. It didn't rain for dozens of days in a row, and the pond dried up. The grain was like it had been burned by fire, and the sorghum leaves curled into tubes. More than a hundred sections of waterwheels in the lake couldn't pump water up in a day or two. By the time it came up, the sorghum would also die. I didn't care about anything. I crossed over Yangjia Mountain, ran more than a li, found a pond, and carried water on my shoulders. I carried it for more than twenty days in a row, and the sorghum was all saved.
    It was time to harvest the sorghum. The children ran around causing trouble, all clamoring to eat sugarcane. This isn't sugarcane, this is sorghum. I don't know how much effort it took to stop them.
    More than half a year had passed. The accountant gave me a report: the thirty ridges yielded 1,560 jin of broad beans, 901 jin of soybeans, and 3,840 jin of sorghum. In the late season, I planted corn and buckwheat on all seventy-eight ridges again. Together before and after, I can harvest a total of more than 21,900 jin. People from the county came to inspect production and said that my sorghum grew like city walls. Some people called my village Sorghum City. After all is said and done, it's still thanks to the good leadership of Chairman Mao, and thanks to everyone's efforts. How much of the world could I create alone?
    We are about to establish a people's commune here. I want to live to see communism!

    别人叫我“杂粮爹爹”
    湖北鄂城灯塔乡一社社员　王永霞
    我已经是六十四岁的人了。因为在田埂上种了一些杂粮，大概可以收两万多斤。别人叫我“杂粮爹爹”，叫我住的塆子是“高粱城”。
    春上，毛主席号召大跃进，人人都要搞丰产，连小女娃也要争棉花姑娘。我不能算老，队里叫我放牛，我还想做点重事，想把田埂上种上杂粮。我婆婆说：“你这大年纪，何必找麻烦。”第二天，我碰到王春山，哪晓得他和我婆婆一样：“你不会快活。从十三岁跟地主放牛起，打了三十多年长工，还没累够？你不做事，社里也要养你。”我一听就不爱。他这个人五十多岁就蓄胡子，连四两灯草也懒得拿。跟他说也无益。
    干脆去找队长。我说我要在田埂上种杂粮，一条田埂十斤粮，七十八条田埂就是七八百斤杂粮，过年过节塆里大人小孩都有高粱粑吃。他说：“党的号召，寸土必争，这倒是个好窍门。明天我们派人去搞。你得了两年养牛模范，何必改行？”又说：“你怕社里不照顾你？”我着了急：“一个公鸡四两力，我有点力要出点力。好意思坐着吃？你不答应我就把牛牵来羁到你堂屋里。”队长让我争赢了，七十八条田埂拨了我三十条。
    我在田埂上种了蚕豆、黄豆，还打算种点高粱。高粱种队里没有。我跟队长说：“一家拿一勺出来就有了。”有些人拿出来了，有的人推这推那，有的人还骂我“想心思害人，连一点高粱种也不饶人”。我说：“种高粱是为社，我不扎私房，丰收了还不是大家吃。”
    种子下了，苗也长得壮，就是缺肥。我一个人一双手，两三个月积了三四千斤粪。社里的副主任是个热心人，他帮我收了好些鸡鸭粪。我的心越来越大了。我打算把七十八条田埂都种上。有人说七说八：“这大个心，看你争个花争个朵吧。”塆下有个后生叫王佑华，跑来对我说：“靠你搞生产，把人也饿死了，除非粮食从天上掉下来。”我心想，瞧不起我，你一个人还能顶个天？一人出四两力，一百人就是四百两。田头地角也是土，就不该荒废。多收一粒是一粒，年纪轻不会算细账。想到这里，我逗了他几句：“你靠大田大地丰产，我靠你种掉了的地角搞丰产，不怕你年轻，我打的粮食要比你多。”
    秧子刚开岔，突然死了一些。有人告诉我，是长了虫。我扒在地下，沿着秧子用指甲挖，真挖出了虫，有蚕子大。这是地老虎。管他天老虎地老虎，你害我的苗，我就要你的命。我这样一棵棵地捉了四天多，才把虫捉完。
    天也和我作对。一连几十天不落雨，塘干破了底。谷像火烧过的一样，高粱叶子卷成筒筒。湖里车水一百多节，一两天上不来。等上来，高粱也要死了。我不管三七二十一，翻过杨家山，跑一里多路，找了个塘用肩挑水。一连挑了二十多天，高粱都被救活了。
    拔高粱了，小伢跑来捣乱，都吵要吃甘蔗。这哪里是甘蔗呢，这是高粱。又不晓得费了好大的力把他们拦住。
    一年过了大半年，会计跟我报了个账：三十条田埂收了一千五百六十斤蚕豆，九百零一斤黄豆，三千八百四十斤高粱。晚季我又把七十八条田埂都种上包谷和荞麦，连前带后一共可以收到两万一千九百多斤。县里来人检查生产，说我的高粱长得像城墙，有人就把我这个塆子叫高粱城。说来说去还是得亏了毛主席的领导好，得亏了大家的力量，我一个人能造几大个世界呢？
    我们这里就要办人民公社了，我要活到共产主义才好咧！
