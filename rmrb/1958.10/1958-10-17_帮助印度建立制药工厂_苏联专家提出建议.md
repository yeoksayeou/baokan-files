    Helping India Build Pharmaceutical Factories
    Soviet Experts Offer Advice

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi – The Soviet Union is currently helping India establish its pharmaceutical industry.

    A Soviet expert delegation, headed by Natradze, submitted a report to the Indian government on the 14th after a two-month investigation in India. The report recommends the establishment of five units, including factories for antibiotics and synthetic drugs, factories for domestically produced herbal medicines, factories for surgical instruments, and factories for diabetes medications.

    The Indian people urgently need the development of the pharmaceutical industry. Importing drugs from foreign countries costs more than 120 million rupees in foreign exchange each year.

    An American pharmaceutical company once signed an agreement with India to produce streptomycin. There are reports that this company demanded the right to keep technical knowledge confidential, while India would have to pay royalty fees for ten years.
