Xinhua News Agency, 29th: In order to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the nation next year, the national cultural and art circles have decided to launch cultural and artistic "satellites" on a grand scale. Through artistic images, they will vividly reflect the construction achievements of our country over the past ten years, the changes in the production, life, and spiritual outlook of our people, and the history of revolutionary struggle. At the same time, they will also launch "satellites" in the field of artistic theoretical research. The Art "Satellite" Leading Group has now been jointly formed by relevant units such as the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Ballad Singers Association, the Chinese Dance Research Association, the China Film Workers Association, the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Since October, the Art "Satellite" Leading Group has held several meetings to study the standards of the Art "Satellite" and how to launch the Art "Satellite", and has formulated a preliminary plan for creating Art "Satellites". According to the opinions discussed by the leading group, the Art "Satellite" should be the newest and most beautiful, with communist and socialist ideological content, beautiful national artistic forms and highly expressive techniques, a combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and artistic works that are loved by the broad masses of people. The themes of the "satellites" should be rich and diverse. First of all, they should reflect themes with major political significance and reflect the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They also need historical themes of revolutionary struggle, adaptation and processing of popular repertoires, and so on. The style of artistic creation should be diverse and allow a hundred flowers to bloom. In terms of form, both large, medium, and small should be taken into account. In short, these artistic "satellites," regardless of content and form, should have obvious leaps forward, break through past levels, and become the cutting edge of each county, province, or the entire country. All communes, counties, provinces, art troupes, and art colleges across the country are required to actively launch a large number of artistic "satellites" and select them at all levels. Finally, the national artistic "satellites" will participate in the National Art Exhibition Month, the National Film Exhibition Month, and the National Art Exhibition held around the National Day next year, as an important part of the grand celebration activities for the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

When discussing how to launch artistic "satellites," the leading group believed that the creation of artistic "satellites" must also be under the leadership of party committees at all levels, follow the mass line, combine universal mobilization with key creation, combine experts with the masses, and combine individuals with collectives, so that the launching of "satellites" is combined with the popularization of culture and art. It is necessary to fully mobilize the potential of the broad masses to create, mobilize all forces from workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers who are capable of creating, and also cooperate between the amateur creation of the masses and professional creation. At the same time, it advocates communist large-scale collaboration. All regions, art groups, and art workers should assist each other to ensure the launching of numerous and bright artistic "satellites." Through the activity of launching "satellites," further promote the popularization and improvement of literary and artistic work.

In addition to requiring art to launch "satellites," the leading group also studied the work of unified command and planning for launching "satellites" in publishing, cultural relics, and other aspects.

At present, various art groups, national literary and art workers, and cultural departments have begun active actions to launch "satellites." Literary and art organizations such as the Chinese Artists Association, the Dramatists Association, the Musicians Association, and the Ballad Singers Association have successively held meetings to study "satellite" planning and measures. The Ministry of Culture and the Artists Association will also jointly hold a national art work conference recently to further specifically study and deploy the work of radiating art "satellites." Many provinces and cities such as Jiangxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have all formulated plans and measures for radiating cultural and artistic "satellites" under the personal leadership of the party committee.

    放射最新最美又多又亮的文艺“卫星”
    充分反映伟大祖国变化
    全国文化艺术界积极准备迎接建国十周年国庆
    新华社29日讯　为迎接明年建国十周年国庆，全国文化艺术界决定大放文化艺术“卫星”，通过艺术形象，生动地反映我国十周年来的建设成就，反映我国人民生产、生活、精神面貌的变化，反映革命斗争历史，同时在艺术理论研究方面也要发射“卫星”。现在，艺术“卫星”领导小组已由中央文化部、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国美术家协会、中国曲艺工作者协会、中国舞蹈研究会、中国电影工作者联谊会、中国人民解放军总政治部宣传部、中华全国总工会宣传部等有关单位联合组成。
    10月以来，艺术“卫星”领导小组已举行了若干次会议，研究艺术“卫星”标准以及如何放射艺术“卫星”的问题，并制定了创造艺术“卫星”的初步计划。根据领导小组讨论意见：艺术“卫星”应是最新最美的，具有共产主义、社会主义思想内容，优美的民族艺术形式和高度的表现技巧，革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合，为广大群众所喜闻乐见的艺术作品。“卫星”的题材要求丰富多采，首先要求反映具有重大政治意义、反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设的题材，也需要革命斗争的历史题材，流传剧目的改编、加工等等，艺术创作的风格，要求多种多样，百花齐放。形式上大、中、小都应兼顾。总之，这些艺术“卫星”，无论内容和形式，都应是有明显的跃进，突破过去的水平，成为各县、各省或全国的尖端。要求全国各地公社、县、省、各艺术团体、艺术院校，都积极发射大量艺术“卫星”，并层层选拔，最后产生全国艺术“卫星”参加明年国庆前后举行的全国艺术展览月、全国电影展览月、全国美术展览会展出，作为国庆十周年盛大庆祝活动的重要内容。
    领导小组讨论如何发射艺术“卫星”的问题时，认为创造艺术“卫星”也必须在各级党委领导下，走群众路线，普遍发动和重点创作相结合，专家与群众结合，个人与集体相结合，使大放“卫星”和文化艺术大普及相结合。要充分发动广大群众创作的潜力，发动工农商学兵各方面一切能创作的力量进行创作，也要群众的业余创作和专业创作合作。同时提倡共产主义的大协作，各地区各艺术团体，艺术工作者都应互相协助，以保证发射出又多又亮的艺术“卫星”。通过放“卫星”的活动，进一步推动文艺工作的普及与提高。
    领导小组除了要求艺术放“卫星”外，还研究对出版、文物等方面放“卫星”的工作进行统一指挥、筹划。
    现在，各艺术团体、全国文艺工作者、各文化部门都已开始了发射“卫星”的积极行动。中国美协、剧协、音协、曲协等文艺团体都先后举行了会议，研究了“卫星”规划和措施。文化部和美协最近还将联合召开全国美术工作会议，进一步具体研究、布置放射美术“卫星”的工作。江西、山西、江苏等许多省、市和人民解放军总政治部都在党委亲自领导下，制定了放射文化艺术“卫星”的规划和措施。
