Workers' words:

    Piece-Rate Wages Have Many Drawbacks
    The piece-rate wage system fosters the development of individualistic thinking. To earn more wages, many people only pursue quantity and speed, neglecting quality and economy. If they can easily obtain a lot of wages, they will no longer work hard; if they cannot meet the quota, they will try every possible means to find objective reasons and argue endlessly. They are picky about using tools and choose "fat" tasks and reject "lean" ones. "My" interests are placed above the interests of the country.
    The piece-rate wage system also increases the trouble in management work. For example, in the production of carriages, each component has more than 10,000 pieces, and more than 10,000 work tickets have to be written, which the planning, statistics, and accounting personnel have to go through; when it comes to the production team, the production team leader has to check them all day long, which affects their participation in production. Therefore, I advocate abolishing the piece-rate wage system.

### 计件工资害处多

    计件工资害处多
    计件工资制会助长个人主义思想发展。许多人为了多得工资，只追求多快，不注意好省。不费多大劲就拿到很多工资，便不再努力劳动；达不到定额，又会千方百计寻找客观原因，争吵不休。使用工具，挑挑拣拣；接受任务，挑“肥”拣“瘦”。“我”的利益放在国家利益之上。
    计件工资制还增加了管理工作上的麻烦。例如生产行车，每台零件一万件以上，工票就得写一万多张，计划、统计、核算等人员都得过一遍手；到生产小组时，还得由生产组长整天查对，影响他们参加生产。因此，我主张取消计件工资制。
