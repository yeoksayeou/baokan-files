Ode to National Day
Li Jishen

On the 9th anniversary of the founding of the nation, I happily witness the magnificent miracles of the socialist Great Leap Forward. I joyfully compose twenty-four poems in the seven-character quatrain form as an ode, sharing my joyful and encouraging feelings with 600 million compatriots.

    Nine years since the nation's founding, celebrating today,
    The joyous cheers of the masses shake the blue sky.
    Countless heroes have painstakingly created,
    A magnificent monument stands tall into the clouds.

    We rely on the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union,
    Atomic piles are formed, nuclear heat is transferred.
    We love peace, not fear war,
    Even more, we turn intimidation into smoke.

    The two major declarations of the October Revolution,
    The East wind has already prevailed over the West wind.
    Giants reunite after a year apart,
    The unity of China and the Soviet Union is as close as water and milk.

    The brave soldiers aiding Korea sing with their swords,
    Blood and flesh are connected, righteousness weighs more than mountains.
    Returning with strength to participate in construction,
    Their extraordinary achievements should not be inferior to those in the military.

    Sweeping away dark clouds to see the blue sky,
    Two roads in the midst of struggle.
    White flags are pulled out, red flags are raised,
    Rectification and reform reap immense, unprecedented achievements.

    Breaking superstitions and fostering talent,
    Liberating thinking and opening up wisdom.
    Promoting all-round leaps forward,
    All comes from the general line.

    Rectification and advocacy are carried out nationwide,
    The development of industry and agriculture creates many miracles.
    Naturally, politics is put in command,
    Daring to think and daring to do are the pioneers.

    Catalpa and Phoebe trees are suitable for the soil,
    A myriad of colors display their beauty.
    Mountains and plains are covered in green, with less wind and sand,
    Even more delightful is the time when fruits ripen in abundance.

    The combination of indigenous and foreign methods meets the storm,
    Science and technology simultaneously make great advances.
    The world creates innovation with hands and brains,
    Unceasing revolution plans extraordinary feats.

    Opening up in all directions, covering heaven and earth,
    Each opening up new paths to the nine heavens.
    Jet propulsion, helicopters, electrification of vehicles,
    Flying to the sun and returning from the sun.

    The perseverance to move mountains rivals Yu Gong,
    Turning the sea into water conservancy.
    Achievements in four months surpass those of a thousand years,
    Yu the Great's dredging of rivers is hardly worth discussing.

    Electronics secretly penetrates computers,
    Secretly searching for semiconductors is not strange.
    The latest television is available for all to see,
    Orioles sing and butterflies dance.

    Self-made cars are commonplace,
    Silver wings cross the sky, even these are manufactured.
    Giant ocean-going ships emerge from the waves,
    Riding the wind for thousands of miles, they intimidate the long whales.

    The northern section of the Grand Canal connects to the southern section,
    The expected completion will be unparalleled.
    Willows continuously green along both banks,
    Chaoyang Gate connects to Hou Chao Gate.

    Steel is smelted regardless of foreign or indigenous methods,
    High furnaces reflect red throughout the sky.
    Industry strives for ability, communes manage it,
    There is no difference between urban and rural areas, combining industry and agriculture.

    Steel, grain, and machinery are the three marshals,
    Transportation and electricity are the two to go first.
    One day is equal to twenty years,
    We will catch up with America and surpass England.

    Agricultural implements are renewed with fresh designs,
    Each bearing rolls with round beads.
    Electric plows and electric picks advance simultaneously,
    One day can cultivate ten thousand acres of land.

    Wheat rolls in green waves, rice rolls in clouds,
    Thirteen thousand catties per mu,
    If Michurin were to rise again,
    He would also be amazed by this miracle.

    The People's Commune is a big family,
    Combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs.
    Society is gradually becoming highly developed,
    Sprouts of communism are making a pioneering sound.

    The collective moves towards the whole people step by step,
    Increasing speed towards the broad road.
    The ideals of Marx and Engels are not far away,
    From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

    Policies for protecting grain and preventing disease are not empty,
    The four pests will be eliminated quickly nationwide.
    Red flags are planted everywhere,
    What joy is there in a prosperous year and long life?

    Clouds surge and wind follows, its power is incomparable,
    The militia rises heroically.
    The mighty army shows its new power,
    Defending peace and opposing war.

    Don't be surprised that this year surpasses the past,
    Next year will definitely surpass this year.
    How are these brilliant miracles achieved?
    The whole country sings the praises of wise leadership!

    The myriad achievements are difficult to count,
    The sounds of praise fill the ears.
    Everywhere the people are at peace and things are abundant,
    The whole world celebrates peace and prosperity.

  敢思敢做是先河。
  ?梓楩楠适土宜，
  千红万紫显多姿，
  山原绿遍风沙少，
  更喜离离果熟时。

  科技同时大进军，
  世界创新凭手脑，
  不停革命策奇勋。
  经天纬地八方开，
  各辟新程向九垓，
  喷气直升车电化，
  日边飞去日边来。

  四月胜于千载绩，
  疏河夏禹漫论功。
  电子潜通计算机，
  秘搜半导体非奇，
  最新电视供周览，
  莺弄歌喉蝶舞衣。

  预计功成伟绝伦，
  两岸垂杨青不断，
  朝阳门接候潮门。
  钢铁不分洋土炼，
  高炉处处映天红，
  工业争能公社办，
  城乡无别化工农。
  钢粮机械三元帅，
  交通电力两先行，
  一日等于二十载，
  迎头赶美定超英。
  农具翻新花样鲜，
  轴承个个滚珠圆，
  电犁电镐同时进，
  一日能耕万顷田。
  麦翻绿浪稻翻云，
  亩产十三万几斤，
  倘使米丘林复起，
  也教心折此奇闻。
  人民公社大家庭，
  结合工农商学兵，
  社会日臻高度化，
  萌芽共产肇先声。
  集体全民逐步趋，
  提高速度向康衢，
  马恩理想非遥远，
  各尽所能取所需。
  保粮防病策非虚，
  全国迅将四害除，
  处处红旗都插遍，
  年丰人寿乐何如。
  云涌风从势莫京，
  矫然崛起是民兵，
  雄师昭示新威力，
  捍卫和平反战争。
  莫诧今年胜往昔，
  明年定更胜今年，
  辉煌奇迹何由致？
  举国讴歌领导贤！
  万般成就数难清，
  盈耳洋洋歌颂声，
  到处民安兼物阜，
  普天同庆乐承平。
