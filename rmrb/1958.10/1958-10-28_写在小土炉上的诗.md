Editor's Note: Workers at the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of the Guolin Commune in Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, are smelting iron and writing poetry at the same time. The small indigenous furnaces, as numerous as trees in a forest, and even the bellows, are covered with poems in red and green. It is truly: smelting steel and writing poetry, poems become an ocean and iron becomes a mountain. The following are just a few drops from this ocean.

　　Galloping to Catch Up with Anshan No. 1 Furnace
　　Galloping to catch up with Anshan No. 1 furnace,
　　Is a true hero,
　　Galloping to catch up with Anshan,
　　Anshan Iron and Steel is the nation's first plant,
　　Its blast furnace stands shoulder to shoulder with it.
　　　　(Written on No. 1 Furnace)

　　Taking Big Strides to Chase Longyan No. 2 Furnace
　　Taking big strides to chase Longyan No. 2 furnace,
　　Is not simple,
　　Taking big strides to chase Longyan,
　　Longyan is China's second plant,
　　We'll overtake it in just a day or two.
　　　　(Written on No. 2 Furnace)

　　The Iron Pagoda
　　From afar it looks like a pagoda,
　　Close up, silver flowers bloom beneath the pagoda,
　　A giant holds a great iron staff,
　　The steel marshal rushes out of the pagoda.
　　　　(Written on No. 6 Furnace)

　　The No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant
　　The No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant is in Henan,
　　Furnace fires billowing smoke everywhere,
　　Men and women fighting hard day and night,
　　Iron ingots pile up like mountains after being smelted.
　　　　(Written on No. 10 Furnace)

　　Building a Huangyang Mountain with No. 3 Furnace
　　Building a Huangyang Mountain with No. 3 Furnace,
　　Its head touching the sky,
　　Molten iron flows three times over,
　　Producing one hundred tons of iron every day,
　　Building a Huangyang Mountain in a year.
　　　　(Written on No. 3 Furnace)

　　West Mountain Ore, North Mountain Coal
　　West Mountain ore, North Mountain coal,
　　Trucks, carts, and even donkeys,
　　Millions of steel warriors,
　　Steel piles higher than Mount Wutai.
　　　　(Written on No. 58 Furnace)

　　Mouth Can Swallow Ten Thousand Mountains
　　Don't underestimate each indigenous furnace,
　　Its mouth can swallow ten thousand mountains,
　　If Sun Wukong didn't run fast,
　　His golden cudgel would melt inside.
　　　　(Written on No. 47 Furnace)

　　Ode to the Bellows
　　Don't judge it by its small size,
　　The furnace fire smiles at it.
　　　(Written on the bellows of No. 40 small furnace)

　　Steel Marshal Ascends the Throne
　　Yesterday, the mountain was full of fruit,
　　Today, the furnace fire fills the sky,
　　The steel marshal ascends the throne,
　　Liberating Taiwan will not be difficult.
　　　　(Written on No. 58 Furnace)

    写在小土炉上的诗
    编者按：河北涿鹿县果林公社第一炼铁厂工人们一边炼铁，一边写诗，像树林一样多的小土炉上，甚至风箱上，红红绿绿，都写着诗。真是：又炼钢铁又写诗，诗成海洋铁成山。这里发表的，只是这海洋中的几滴。
    快马加鞭赶鞍山一号炉，是好汉，快马加鞭赶鞍山，鞍钢全国第一厂，高炉与它肩并肩。
          （写在一号炉上）
    迈开大步追龙烟二号炉，不简单，迈开大步追龙烟，龙烟中国第二厂，撵它不过一两天。
          （写在二号炉上）
    塔远远望去像座塔，近看塔下放银花，巨人手执大铁杖，钢铁元帅奔出塔。
          （写在六号炉上）
    炼铁一厂炼铁一厂在河南，四处炉火冒青烟，男女苦战一昼夜，出炉的铁块堆成山。
          （写在十号炉上）
    垒座黄羊山三号炉，头顶天，铁水奔流翻三番，每天出铁一百吨，一年垒座黄羊山。
            （写在三号炉上）西山矿石北山煤西山矿石北山煤，汽车大车加毛驴，钢铁战士千百万，钢堆高过五台山。
      （写在五十八号炉上）张嘴能吞万座山别看个个是土炉，张嘴能吞万座山，不是孙猴跑的快，金篐大棒化里边。
        （写在四十七号炉）
    风箱赞别看东西个不大，炉火见它笑哈哈。
  （写在四十号小炉风箱上）钢帅升宝座昨日花果堆满山，今日炉火红满天，钢铁元帅升宝座，解放台湾不费难，
      （写在五十八号炉上）
