Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch from Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, with a guilty conscience, dares not confront NBC reporter Brown regarding the blatant, aggressive remarks he made to Brown.

After Kishi Nobusuke's conversation was published, it immediately met with angry condemnation from the Japanese people. Kishi Nobusuke was very flustered, and he immediately held a press conference on the 15th, attempting to deny his statements about abolishing the war-renouncing clauses in the Japanese Constitution. He said that the content broadcast by NBC contained "many errors."

However, NBC published four broadcast scripts from Brown in Tokyo on the 15th, confirming that the content of these scripts was full of Kishi Nobusuke's aggressive and anti-communist remarks.

On the same day, Brown, who had already returned to the United States, reaffirmed in a broadcast Kishi Nobusuke's remarks about abolishing the war-renouncing clauses in the Constitution. Currently, Brown has a recording of Kishi Nobusuke's conversation in his possession.

Members of the Japan Socialist Party have been exposing the imperialist nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government in continuous questioning in the Diet. To prevent Kishi Nobusuke from quibbling, the Socialist Party has also decided to have Brown come to the Japanese Diet to confront Kishi Nobusuke. The Socialist Party is also preparing to submit a motion of no confidence against the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet after the confrontation.

Kishi Nobusuke is burying his head in the sand and refusing to confront Brown. He instructed his Chief Cabinet Secretary Munenori Akagi to issue a statement on the 20th, saying that having Brown come to the Japanese Diet to confront Kishi Nobusuke would be "damaging the prestige of the Diet," and therefore, it was "impossible." Akagi also clumsily defended that even if the content of Brown's report was not much different from Kishi Nobusuke's remarks, the "inferences" made by Brown were different from the original meaning.

    口说有凭录音在　侵略叫嚣难抵赖
    岸信介不敢和布朗对质
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本首相岸信介作贼心虚，不敢和美国全国广播公司记者布朗对证他向布朗发表的露骨的侵略性言论。
    岸信介的谈话发表以后，立即遭到日本人民的愤怒谴责。岸信介十分慌张，他马上在15日举行记者招待会，企图抵赖他曾经说过的关于废止日本宪法中放弃战争的条款的谈话。他说，美国全国广播公司广播的内容“错误很多”。
    但是，美国全国广播公司在15日发表的布朗从东京发出的四篇广播稿，证实这些稿子的内容都充满了岸信介的侵略性的和反共的言论。
    同一天，已经回到美国的布朗还在广播中再次肯定了岸信介关于要废除宪法中放弃战争的条款的谈话。目前，布朗手里还有岸信介谈话的录音。
    日本社会党的议员连日在国会的质询中揭露岸信介政府的帝国主义的本性。为了使岸信介无法狡辩，社会党还决定要布朗到日本国会来同岸信介对质。社会党并且准备在对质后对岸信介内阁提出不信任案。
    岸信介掩耳盗铃，拒绝和布朗对质。他指使他的内阁官房长官赤城宗德在20日出来发表谈话说，要布朗到日本国会同岸信介对质是“损害国会威信”的事情，因此，这是“办不到”的。赤城还拙劣地辩解说，即使布朗的报道内容同岸信介的谈话没有多大出入，布朗所作出的“推论”也是同原意有差别的。
