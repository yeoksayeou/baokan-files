    Congratulations on the New Development of Friendly Unity Between the Working Classes of China and Japan
    On October 3, the delegation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), who were invited to visit our country, issued a joint statement with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions after friendly talks. Both sides reached a consensus on issues such as the tense situation in the Taiwan region, strengthening the friendly unity between Chinese and Japanese workers and trade union organizations, promoting friendly relations between the people of China and Japan, and normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries. The joint statement also emphasized that the working classes and peoples of Asian and African countries should strengthen friendly unity and support each other in opposing American aggression and defending peace in Asia and the world. These good wishes reflect the common demands of the working classes and peoples of China and Japan and are a solid foundation for further strengthening friendly unity between the two countries.
    What is particularly welcome is that the "Sohyo" delegation of Japan reiterated its position on the situation in the Taiwan Strait in the joint statement, clearly demanding that all American armed forces get out of the Taiwan Strait and Okinawa Island, and gave warm support to the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Jinmen, Mazu and Taiwan. The "Sohyo" delegation believes that the United States' armed occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and its armed intervention and war provocations in the Taiwan Strait region, attempting to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands, is an unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs; at the same time, it believes that the United States is the root cause of constantly creating tension in Asia and threatening and undermining peace in Asia and the Far East.
    The Japanese "Sohyo," which has 3.6 million members, is the largest trade union organization in Japan. Together with various progressive parties and democratic strata in Japan, it has always stood on the front line of the Japanese people's struggle for peace, for friendship with the Chinese people, and for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Because the Japanese working class, based on its own experience, deeply realizes that American imperialism, which occupies Japan's territory of Okinawa, is domineering and arrogant on Japanese territory, and deprives the Japanese nation of its sovereignty, is the common enemy of the Japanese people and the Chinese people. The US imperialism's creation of a tense situation in the Taiwan Strait not only threatens China's security but also seriously undermines peace in the Far East, thus placing Japan, which is in a state of American semi-occupation, in a more precarious position.
    The Japanese "Sohyo's" fair position on the Taiwan region situation is elaborated in its basic attitude and policy on the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait region issued on September 30. It opposes the United States' armed intervention and war provocations against China, and calls on all Japanese people to participate in the struggle to "oppose the US military's armed intervention in the Taiwan Strait." To this end, "Sohyo" also decided: at the upcoming "Conference to Open Japan-China Relations," to focus on the issue of US armed intervention in China's internal affairs; from October 1 to 8, to conduct street propaganda to the Japanese people on the Taiwan situation and Japan-China relations; to organize "countermeasure committees" centered on prefectural and regional trade unions, peace organizations, and friendly organizations, and to combine the Taiwan situation with issues such as opening Japan-China relations and opposing Japan's nuclear armament, and carry out various forms of mass struggle to oppose American aggression and protest the Japanese government's pursuit of American war policies. "Sohyo" also launched a signature campaign in October for the struggle to open Japan-China relations, etc. These powerful actions by the Japanese working class and various people's organizations will be a powerful blow to American war provocations.
    In stark contrast to the position of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, the Kishi Nobusuke government, which betrays the interests of the Japanese nation, not only stubbornly adheres to its reactionary anti-China policy, and tries its best to obstruct and undermine the development of friendly relations between the people of China and Japan and the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries, but also acts as an accomplice, willingly acting as a pawn of the United States. While stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, the Kishi Nobusuke government allows the US military to use Japanese military bases, and takes advantage of the United States' creation of tension in the Far East to accelerate the nuclear armament of the Japanese army, attempting to drag the Japanese people into the US atomic strategy system in order to realize its ambition of reviving militarism. Following Fujiyama's role as Dulles' echo at the UN General Assembly, clamoring that "the use of force cannot be tolerated" in the Taiwan region, Kishi Nobusuke in his speech to the Japanese Diet's extraordinary session on September 30, again clamored that "regarding the Taiwan Strait issue, force should not be used to resolve it under any circumstances," and said extremely shamelessly that he "does not think it can be clearly determined that (this issue) is merely China's internal affair." In a memorandum issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on October 2 in response to the Soviet protest, it completely echoed the US imperialism, nonsensically claiming that the actions taken by the United States in the Taiwan Strait were not acts of aggression, and maliciously slandered our people. At the same time, disregarding the repeated protests of our government and the opposition of the Japanese people, the Kishi Nobusuke government condoned thugs on September 30 to tear down the Chinese national flag hanging at a restaurant opened by overseas Chinese in Yokohama, openly carrying out a second intolerable insult to our national flag. The "Sohyo" delegation strongly condemned such retrograde and reactionary policies of the Kishi Nobusuke government in the joint statement, and solemnly demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government abolish the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and the "Japan-Chiang Treaty," refuse the US military to use military bases in mainland Japan and Okinawa, and immediately stop its policy of hostility toward the Chinese people.
    Our people fully support the Japanese people's struggle to get rid of American enslavement, strive for true national independence, freedom, democracy, peace, and strengthen Sino-Japanese people's friendship and restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. We believe that as long as the Japanese people unite and fight together, as long as the working classes and peoples of China and Japan continue to strengthen friendly unity, then any obstacles hindering Sino-Japanese people's friendship will be swept away. Moreover, the joint efforts of the people of China and Japan will surely make an important contribution to defending peace in the Far East. We are pleased with the new development of friendly unity between the working classes of China and Japan, and we extend our heartfelt respect to the Japanese working class and the peace-loving Japanese people.

### 祝贺中日两国工人阶级友好团结的新发展

    祝贺中日两国工人阶级友好团结的新发展
    10月3日，应邀来我国访问的日本工会总评议会代表团同中华全国总工会，经过友好的会谈后，发表了一项联合声明。双方对于台湾地区的紧张局势，加强中日两国工人、工会组织的友好团结，促进中日两国人民友好关系以及两国邦交正常化等问题，取得了一致的意见。联合声明还强调，亚非各国工人阶级、各国人民在反对美国侵略，保卫亚洲和世界和平方面，应加强友好团结，相互支援。这些良好的愿望，反映了中日两国工人阶级和人民的共同要求，是两国工人阶级和人民进一步加强友好团结的巩固基础。
    特别值得欢迎的是，日本“总评”代表团在联合声明中，重申了它在台湾海峡地区局势上的立场，明确提出要求美国一切武装力量由台湾海峡和冲绳岛滚出去，并对于中国人民解放自己的领土金门、马祖和台湾的正义斗争，给予了热情的支持。“总评”代表团认为，美国武装霸占中国领土台湾，在台湾海峡地区进行武装干涉和战争挑衅，企图阻挠中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿，是对中国内政的无理干涉；同时认为，美国是不断制造亚洲紧张局势，威胁和破坏亚洲及远东和平的祸根。
    拥有三百六十万会员的日本“总评”，是日本最大的工会组织。它和日本各进步党派、各民主阶层一道，一向站在日本人民争取和平，争取同中国人民友好和恢复中日邦交斗争的战线上。因为日本工人阶级基于切身的体验，深刻地认识到霸占日本国土冲绳，在日本领土上专横霸道，剥夺日本民族主权的美帝国主义，是日本人民和中国人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势，不仅威胁着中国的安全，而且严重地破坏远东的和平，从而使处在美国半占领状态下的日本陷于更加不安的地位。
    日本“总评”对台湾地区局势的公正立场，在它9月30日发表的对台湾海峡地区紧张局势问题的基本态度和方针里，有所阐述。它反对美国对中国进行武装干涉和战争挑衅，并号召全体日本人民参加“反对美军在台湾海峡进行武装干涉”的斗争。为此，“总评”还决定：在即将举行的“打开日中关系大会”上，着重讨论美国武装干涉中国内政的问题；从10月1日到8日，就台湾局势问题和日中关系问题向日本人民进行街头宣传；组织以县和地区单位工会以及和平团体、友好团体为中心的“对策委员会”，并且把台湾局势问题同打开日中关系、反对日本核武装等问题结合起来，展开各种形式的群众斗争，反对美国侵略，抗议日本政府追随美国战争政策。“总评”还发起在10月里为打开日中关系等的斗争展开一个签名运动。日本工人阶级和各人民团体的这些有力行动，将是对美国战争挑衅的有力打击。
    同日本工人阶级和广大人民的立场截然相反，出卖日本民族利益的岸信介政府，不仅一味坚持敌视中国的反动政策，极力阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好关系的发展与两国邦交的正常化，而且为虎作伥，甘愿充当美国的走卒。岸信介政府在加紧复活日本军国主义的同时，容许美国军队使用日本的军事基地，并且趁着美国在远东制造紧张局势，加紧进行日本军队的核武装，企图把日本人民拖入美国的原子战略体系，以实现它的复活军国主义的野心。继藤山在联合国大会上充当杜勒斯的应声虫，叫嚷在台湾地区“不能容许使用武力”后，9月30日岸信介在日本国会临时会议的演说中，又叫嚣“对于台湾海峡问题，不论在什么样的情况下，都不应该使用武力来解决”，并极端无耻地说，他“不认为可以明确地断定（这个问题）只是中国的内政问题”。10月2日日本外务省就苏联的抗议而发表的一份备忘录中，更完全是同美帝国主义一鼻孔出气，胡说什么美国在台湾海峡采取的行动不是侵略行为，并对我国人民进行了恶毒的诬蔑。同时，不顾我国政府一再抗议和日本人民的反对，岸信介政府纵容暴徒于9月30日将横滨一家华侨开设的饭馆悬挂的中国国旗扯去，公开地对我国国旗进行了第二次不可容忍的侮辱。对于岸信介政府的这种倒行逆施的反动政策，“总评”代表团在联合声明中给予了强烈的谴责，并严正地要求岸信介政府废除日美“安全保障条约”和“日蒋条约”，拒绝美军使用日本本土和冲绳的军事基地，立即停止敌视中国人民的政策。
    我国人民完全支持日本人民为摆脱美国奴役，争取真正的民族独立自由、民主和平与加强中日人民友好和恢复中日邦交的斗争。我们相信，只要日本人民团结一致共同奋斗，只要中日两国工人阶级和人民不断加强友好团结，那末任何阻挠中日人民友好的障碍都将被扫除干净。而且中日两国人民的共同努力，必将对于保卫远东的和平作出重要的贡献。我们对中日两国工人阶级友好团结的新发展感到高兴，并向日本工人阶级和爱好和平的日本人民致以衷心的敬意。
