Harvest Rhyme
Jin Jin, Poetry, Wang Shuhui, Painting

Guess how much I went to the field to harvest rice. The early rice is taller than me. One rice head turns into three. I only blame the sickle for being too small.
The rice thresher spins tightly. The harvested rice is weighed. Guess how much the harvest is? Exactly 10,000 jin per mu.

New rice Harvest early rice, put it in baskets, the drying ground is a golden yellow, the winnower turns and creaks, carrying load after load into the granary. Return to the dining hall in the evening, and smell the fragrant aroma inside the house. It turns out that new rice has been cooked, and we want to invite the commune members to taste it.

The commune is full of golden mountains High mountains, low mountains, the commune is full of golden mountains, one in the east, one in the west, golden mountain tops facing the sun. Golden mountains are treasures among treasures, higher today than yesterday, one year's output equals ten years, socialism is truly good.

Good harvest this year Good harvest in the commune this year
Harvest, new granaries countless
Countless, every piece is a high-
Yielding field, Young Pioneers also
Want to go to Beijing.

Turn the late rice over again several times Drums beating loudly, red flags are flying, thousands and tens of thousands of people participate, celebrating the harvest with joy. You wear new cloth shoes, I wear floral cloth shirts, Grandma goes out for the first time, and also comes to the county to have fun. The early rice has just been harvested, the late rice has just been planted, happily celebrating the festival, and then turning the late rice over again several times.

    丰收儿歌
    金近　诗　王叔晖　画
   你猜有多少我到田里去割稻，早稻比我长得高，稻头一个变三个，只怪镰刀做得小。打稻机，转得紧，打下稻谷秤一秤，你猜收成有多少？每亩恰好一万斤。
    新米饭割早稻，箩里装，晒场上面一片黄，风车扬谷咯咯叫，一担一担挑进仓。晚间回来进食堂，闻到屋里喷喷香，原来煮了新米饭，要请社员尝一尝。社里处处是金山高高山，低低山，社里处处是金山，东一座，西一座，金黄的山头朝太阳。金山就是宝中宝，今天又比昨天高，一年产量抵十年，社会主义真正好。
    今年好收成今年社里好
  收成，新造谷仓数
  不清，块块都是高
  产田，少先队员也
  要上北京。
   再把晚稻翻几番锣鼓咚咚锵，红旗在飘扬，千人万人来参加，庆祝丰收喜洋洋。你穿新布鞋，我穿花布衫，婆婆出门第一次，也到县里来玩玩。早稻刚收进，晚稻新插上，欢欢喜喜过个节，再把晚稻翻几番。
