    One Team, Two Approaches
    Sichuan Combines Deep Plowing with Early Sweet Potato Harvesting
    (Our newspaper's Chengdu dispatch) Sichuan Province is universally beginning to harvest sweet potatoes early in conjunction with deep plowing. In the major sweet potato producing areas of Nanchong, Neijiang, Mianyang, and other regions, sweet potato harvesting work has started more than half a month earlier than last year.
    This year, Sichuan Province's sweet potato acreage has reached over 30 million mu due to expanded planting and vigorous utilization of vacant land to plant "stacked sweet potatoes," nearly doubling the previous year's acreage. The total output reached 130 billion jin, equivalent to over 32 billion jin of grain, accounting for one-third of the province's total grain production. To ensure that all this grain is secured, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan led farmers in various preparations for sweet potato harvesting, processing, and other aspects several months ago. At the same time, they issued the call for "early harvesting, early consumption, and early processing." Many localities also launched widespread debates before harvesting, addressing the concerns of some cadres and farmers that "early harvesting will affect yield" and "deep plowing and sweet potato harvesting at the same time will strain labor." They recognized that harvesting not only avoids waste due to rotting sweet potatoes but also allows for the combination of harvesting with deep plowing, ensuring timely wheat sowing. The sweet potato plows created in Xichong, Fushun, Longchang, and other places can both harvest sweet potatoes and deep plow. Many specialized teams are both deep plowing teams and sweet potato harvesting teams, with one team handling both tasks simultaneously. Xichong County originally planned that 1.5 million laborers would be needed to harvest all the sweet potatoes in the county. Now, by combining with deep plowing, only 600,000 laborers are needed. In early October, the county organized an army of 100,000 deep plowers, who deep plowed 100,000 mu of land and harvested over 30,000 mu of sweet potatoes, accounting for one-tenth of the county's sweet potato acreage, in just a few days. Various localities in the Mianyang region have also vigorously mobilized urban residents and cadres from schools and government offices to dig and transport sweet potatoes designated for their own food rations by assigning specific areas.
    During the sweet potato harvest, all localities have also vigorously carried out tool reforms, focusing on the manufacture and promotion of sweet potato plows. In Nanchong, Neijiang, and other places, the entire population was mobilized, concentrating all iron and woodworking artisans, and encouraging the masses to contribute iron and materials. A large number of improved tools were manufactured in just a few days. Currently, over 400,000 sweet potato plows have been promoted throughout the province. The efficiency of this plow is three to five times higher than manual digging, and in some cases, it is 30 times higher, accelerating the speed of sweet potato harvesting.
    In coordination with the sweet potato harvest, various localities have adopted the method of "digging, eating, and processing simultaneously" in transportation, storage, and processing. They are stepping up the production and promotion of processing tools, building large numbers of sweet potato cellars, flour mills, wineries, distilleries, and sugar mills, creating a new situation of comprehensive great leap forward in sweet potato processing centered on sweet potato harvesting.

    一套人马双管齐下
    四川结合深耕早挖甘薯
    本报成都电  四川省各地结合深耕普遍开始早挖红苕（甘薯）。红苕主要产区南充、内江、绵阳等专区，挖苕工作都比去年提早半个多月。
    今年四川省的红苕由于扩大种植和大力利用空地种“堆堆苕”，面积达三千多万亩，比去年扩大近一倍，总产量达一千三百亿斤，折原粮三百二十多亿斤，占全省粮食总产量的三分之一。为使这批粮食全部拿到手里，四川各级党委早在几个月前就领导各地农民进行了红苕收挖、处理等各方面准备工作，同时提出了“早挖、早吃、早处理”的号召。许多地方并针对部分干部和农民中存在的“挖早了影响产量”、“要深耕又要挖苕，劳力太紧”等思想，在挖苕之前普遍展开了辩论，认识到挖苕不仅可以避免烂苕浪费，而且可以使挖苕与深耕相结合，及时保证小麦播种。西充、富顺、隆昌等地创造的挖苕犁，既能挖红苕，又能深耕；许多专业队既是深耕队又是挖苕队，一套人马，双管齐下。西充县原计划一百五十万个劳力才能挖完全县红苕，现在结合深耕只要六十万个劳力就可以挖完。10月初，这个县组织了十万深翻大军，几天功夫就深翻地十万亩，挖红苕三万多亩，占全县红苕面积的十分之一。绵阳专区各地还大力发动城镇人民和学校机关干部，采取划片定点办法，挖、运本身应配给做口粮的红苕。
    挖苕中，各地还以制造、推广挖苕犁为中心，大力进行工具改革。南充、内江等地，全民动手，集中全部铁木工匠，发动群众献铁献料，几天内就制造出大批改良工具。目前全省推广的挖苕犁已达四十万部以上。这种犁的功效比人挖提高三倍到五倍，有的达三十倍，加快了挖苕速度。
    配合挖苕，在运输、贮存、加工等方面，各地都采取了“边挖、边吃、边加工”的办法，加紧大量赶制和推广加工工具，修建大批苕窖和粉房、酒厂、酒精厂、糖厂，出现了一个以挖苕为中心带动红苕处理工作全盘大跃进的新形势。
