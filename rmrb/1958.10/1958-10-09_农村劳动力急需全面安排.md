Rural Labor Force Needs Comprehensive Arrangement Urgently

Labor shortage is a major difficulty encountered in the forward leap of rural production and construction. Especially at present, with the vigorous development of steel production, it is necessary to draw a group of laborers from the countryside to form a strong steelmaking force. On the other hand, this year's autumn harvest and planting tasks are very heavy, and the demand for labor in agricultural production has also increased greatly. Therefore, the problem of labor shortage is now even more prominent.

There must also be a correct understanding of this issue. It is not a bad thing, but a good thing that a labor shortage occurs in a country with a population of 600 million. This fact itself reflects how extraordinary the rapid progress of our country's socialist construction is. Just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi said during his inspection of Henan Province, labor shortage is a great thing. Since labor shortage is a temporary difficulty that occurs in the overall leap forward in industry and agriculture, it will inevitably be gradually eliminated in this great leap forward. The consolidation and development of the people's commune system, and the accelerated realization of national industrialization and agricultural mechanization and electrification, will provide a reliable guarantee for eliminating the labor shortage. The current tool reform movement can also alleviate the labor shortage.

The labor situation in rural areas is much more tense than in the past, but can it be said that it is already unbearably tense, so tense that it is impossible to do both industry and agriculture? We believe that this is not the case. It should be seen that even now, when everyone feels a labor shortage, the labor potential in rural areas is still considerable. As long as we take a positive and realistic attitude to look at the problem, we will find the potential in this regard. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said during his inspection of Henan Province that there are five things that need to be done to solve the problem of labor shortage in urban and rural areas. These are: first, to enable all people with labor capacity to engage in labor, especially physical labor; second, to liberate women from household labor; third, to carry out technological revolution; fourth, to improve the social organization of labor; and fifth, to improve technical and cultural level. These five points represent the five main aspects of labor potential and are the fundamental ways to solve the current labor shortage. Some comrades say that the labor problem is terribly tense because when calculating the labor force, they only see the labor force that has been organized and is relatively easy to organize, and ignore the various labor forces that can be used in society, and ignore the potential for improving labor efficiency. As a result, the more they calculate, the more they feel the labor shortage. This is also the case. At present, many areas have not yet universally established collective welfare facilities such as public canteens, kindergartens, and sewing factories. Therefore, a large number of women's labor force in these places has not yet been liberated from trivial housework; many urban residents have not been mobilized to engage in agricultural labor; and the labor organization of many people's communes has not yet been on the right track, and labor efficiency is not high. In short, as long as we do more in these areas, we will take a step forward in solving the problem of labor shortage.

How can we most quickly and effectively unleash labor potential and overcome the difficulty of labor shortage? The experience of many regions proves that the key lies in comprehensive arrangement. Vigorously developing steel production is currently the primary task of the whole party and the whole people, but when vigorously developing steel production, agriculture should not be abandoned. Local leading organs should, in the spirit of grasping industry with one hand and agriculture with the other, comprehensively arrange the labor force used in industry and agriculture. On the premise of first ensuring the accelerated development of steel production, fully organize the labor force in all aspects to ensure the victorious completion of the autumn harvest and planting tasks. In fact, not only steel production and autumn harvest and planting need comprehensive arrangements, but also other aspects such as agricultural product procurement, transportation, afforestation, and manure accumulation need to be properly arranged. There are also favorable conditions for comprehensive arrangement of labor that did not exist in the past. In the past, when making comprehensive arrangements for labor, they were often limited by the small scale of agricultural cooperatives. Now, people's communes have been universally established in the vast rural areas, and some places have also established county federations of communes, which makes it easier for the leadership to make comprehensive arrangements for labor. The problem is whether the leadership can make comprehensive arrangements for labor. After vigorously developing steel production, Pingyao County in Shanxi Province was short of more than 50,000 agricultural laborers. The county party committee immediately proposed a series of emergency measures, deciding that the county party committee would uniformly allocate the county's labor force and immediately eliminate the chaos in labor allocation. The county party committee also decided to suspend and postpone a number of county, township, and commune industrial and water conservancy construction projects, and withdraw more than 10,000 laborers to strengthen the steel and agricultural fronts. In addition, a large number of laborers were drawn from organs, shops, and urban residents to support steel and agricultural production. All schools implemented part-work and part-study programs, and suspended classes for a few days to participate in labor when necessary, and made up for classes during the winter vacation at the end of the year. This was equivalent to adding more than 50,000 laborers. As a result of the comprehensive arrangement in Pingyao County, the victorious completion of the steel production task was ensured, and the timely completion of wheat planting and autumn harvest was also ensured.

There are two critical points for comprehensive arrangement of labor force: one is the county leading organ, and the other is the people's commune. It seems that the county leading organs are more familiar with and have better methods for the comprehensive arrangement of labor force. Pingyao County is an example. But this is not the case in the people's communes. On the one hand, the original production management methods of agricultural production cooperatives are no longer applicable, and new management methods suitable for larger-scale production have not yet been explored. On the other hand, during this period of vigorously developing steel production, the first and second leaders of the commune went to engage in steel production. The third and fourth leaders who stayed in the commune lacked experience in managing the household and were not good at "deploying troops." This is one of the important reasons why many communes currently have a good attendance rate but low labor efficiency and neglect one thing while attending to another in production. Therefore, the higher-level leading organs have the responsibility to help the leading cadres of these people's communes do a good job in comprehensively and reasonably allocating labor force. Of course, when making comprehensive arrangements for labor force, leading cadres at all levels must consult with the commune members and listen to their opinions. Because Chaoying People's Commune in Wushan County, Gansu Province, transferred a large number of laborers to steel production and to support the Yintao Irrigation Project, the actual labor force participating in agricultural production accounted for only about 40% of the total labor force. Some commune members in the commune had no confidence in completing the agricultural production tasks. Later, the commune party committee organized the masses to debate how to solve the problem of labor shortage. Finally, it was decided to concentrate forces (labor force, leadership force, and technical force are concentrated), and attack in sections. The problem was solved quickly, and labor efficiency was also high. In just a few days, great progress was made in autumn harvest, autumn planting, and manure accumulation. People who were originally worried that "this year's wheat will be planted until February next year" also had the confidence to complete the sowing task on time.

In the process of comprehensively arranging labor force, it is also necessary to carry out necessary criticism of the mentality of fearing labor shortage and the idea of overstating labor shortage. Only in this way can we make comprehensive and proper arrangements for labor force and ensure that industrial and agricultural production continues to leap forward.

### 农村劳动力急需全面安排

    农村劳动力急需全面安排
    劳动力不足，这是农村生产建设向前跃进中遇到的一个大困难。特别是在目前，大搞钢铁，必需从农村中抽调一批劳动力组成一支强大的炼钢炼铁队伍，另方面今年的秋收秋种任务又非常繁重，农业生产方面劳动力的需要也大大地增加。因此，劳动力不足的问题目前显得更加突出。
    对这问题也必须有正确的认识。在一个六亿人口的大国里发生劳动力不足的现象，不是坏事而是好事。这个事实本身就反映了我国社会主义建设事业突飞猛进的气派是多么不平凡。正像刘少奇同志在视察河南省时所说的，劳动力紧张是件大好事。劳动力紧张既然是工农业全面大跃进中暂时发生的困难，也必能在这个大跃进中逐步被消除。人民公社制度的巩固和发展，国家工业化和农业机械化、电气化事业的加速实现，都将为消除劳动力紧张现象提供可靠保证。就是目前的工具改革运动，也可以缓和劳动力的紧张。
    农村的劳动力情况是比过去紧张得多，但是，能不能说已经紧张得不得了，已经紧张得不能做到工农业并举了呢？我们认为，并不是这样。应该看到，就是在到处感到劳动力不足的现在，农村中的劳动潜力还是相当大的。只要我们抱着积极的、实事求是的态度去看问题，就会发现这方面的潜力。刘少奇同志在视察河南省的时候说过，要解决城乡劳动力不足的问题，当前需要做好五件事。这就是：第一、使社会所有有劳动能力的人都进行劳动，特别是体力劳动；第二、把妇女从家务劳动中解放出来；第三、搞技术革命；第四、改进社会的劳动组织；第五、提高技术水平和文化水平。这五点就表示着劳动潜力的五个主要方面，也是当前解决劳动力不足问题的根本途径。有些同志所以把劳动力问题说得了不起的紧张，是因为在算劳动力的账的时候，只看见了已经组织起来的和比较容易组织起来的劳动力，而忽视了社会上很多可以利用的各种劳动力，更忽视了提高劳动效率方面的潜力，结果，越算越感到劳动力紧张。事实也是如此。现在还有许多地区没有普遍建立公共食堂、幼儿园、缝纫厂等集体福利设施，因而这些地方的大量的妇女劳动力还没有从琐碎的家务劳动中解放出来；许多城镇的居民还没有被动员起来，投入农业劳动；许多人民公社的劳动组织还没走上正轨，劳动效率不高。总之，只要在这些方面多做些事情，就会在解决劳动力不足的问题上前进一步。
    怎样才能最迅速地、最有效地发挥劳动潜力，从而克服劳动力不足的困难呢？许多地区的经验证明：关键在于全面安排。大干钢铁生产是目前全党全民的首要任务，但是在大干钢铁生产的时候，也不应丢掉农业。各地领导机关应当按照一手抓工业、一手抓农业的精神，全面安排工业和农业所用的劳动力。在首先保证钢铁生产加速发展的前提下，充分组织各方面的劳动力，保证胜利完成秋收秋种任务。其实，不光是钢铁生产和秋收秋种需要全面安排，其他像农产品收购、运输、造林和积肥等等，也都需要作出妥善的安排。在全面安排劳动力问题上，现在也有过去所没有的有利条件。过去在全面安排劳动力的时候，往往会受到农业合作社的狭小规模的局限，现在广大农村普遍建立了人民公社，有些地方还建立了县联社，就更便于领导全面安排劳动力。问题就在于领导上能不能对劳动力进行全面安排。山西省平遥县在大干钢铁生产以后，农业上缺五万多个劳动力。县委立即提出了一系列的紧急措施，决定由县委统一调配全县劳动力，立即消除劳动力调配上的混乱现象。县委还决定，暂停办和缓办一批县、乡、公社的工业和水利建设工程，抽出一万多个劳动力，加强钢铁和农业战线。此外，还从机关、商店、城市居民中抽调一大批劳动力，支援钢铁和农业生产，所有学校实行半工半读，必要时停课几天参加劳动，年终在寒假补课，这样就等于增加了五万多个劳动力。平遥县全面安排的结果，既保证了钢铁生产任务的胜利完成，也保证了种麦、秋收工作的按时进行。
    全面安排劳动力有两个关口，一个是县领导机关，一个是人民公社。现在看来，县领导机关对于全面安排劳动力的问题还是比较熟悉比较有办法的。平遥县就是一个例证。但是在人民公社就不是这样了，一方面，原来农业生产合作社的一套生产管理办法已经不适用，而新的一套适合于更大规模的生产的管理方法还没有摸索出来，另一方面在这大干钢铁生产时期，公社领导干部中第一、二把手都去搞钢铁生产去。留在公社的第三、四把手缺乏当家经验，不善于“调兵遣将”。这是许多公社目前虽然出勤率很好但是劳动效率不高、生产上顾此失彼的重要原因之一。因此，上一级领导机关就有责任多帮助这些人民公社的领导干部做好全面合理调配劳动力的工作。当然，在全面安排劳动力的时候，各级领导干部都必须同社员商量，听取社员的意见。甘肃省武山县超英人民公社因为抽调大批劳动力投入钢铁生产和支援引洮灌溉工程，实际参加农业生产的劳动力只占劳动力总数的40％左右。公社中部分社员对于完成农业生产任务没有信心。后来公社党委组织群众就如何解决劳动力不足的问题进行辩论。最后决定实行集中力量（劳动力、领导力量、技术力量都集中起来），一段一段地突击，问题解决得快，劳动效率也高。在短短的几天中，秋收、秋种、积肥等工作有很大的进展，原来担心“今年的麦子要种到明年2月”的人，也有信心按期完成播种任务了。
    在全面安排劳动力的过程中，还必须同时对害怕劳动力紧张的心理和过分夸张劳动力紧张的思想，进行必要的批判。只有这样，才能对劳动力做出全面妥善的安排，保证工农业生产不断地向前跃进。
