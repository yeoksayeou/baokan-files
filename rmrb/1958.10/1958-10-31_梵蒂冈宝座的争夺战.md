    The Vatican papal chapel's chimney slowly emitted white smoke. The devout Catholics waiting in St. Peter's Square breathed a sigh of relief, as this told them that the new Pope—seventy-seven-year-old Roncalli (John XXIII)—had finally been chosen. They had been waiting here since the beginning of the election, many of them for three whole days—from the morning of the 26th to the afternoon of the 28th.
    The former Pope Pius XII died on October 9th. His followers sent him "back to heaven" with solemn ceremonies. While the funeral was still in progress, scandals spread in Rome. It was said that the Pope's personal physician, taking advantage of his close relationship with Pius XII, stole a large number of documents while the Pope was dying, including the Pope's diary. Britain's "Reynolds News" said: it recorded "many sensational political meetings." Now, these documents have been sold to the "international press," and perhaps one day they will become headline news that will cause a sensation in Western countries.
    When cardinals from all over came to the Vatican to attend the funeral and prepare to elect a new Pope, Dulles also came to Rome at this time. Everyone knows that Dulles is very busy with his "official duties"; he is anxious to go to Taiwan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. However, he still made a trip to Rome, ostensibly to "express condolences to the Pope." We don't need to investigate whether Dulles is a Christian or a Catholic, because this is not important to the US Secretary of State. His main task in Rome was to influence the election of the new Pope, so that the new Pope would cooperate more closely with the diplomatic activities of the US State Department.
    Shortly after Dulles left Rome, the election of the new Pope began. At 6 p.m. on the 25th, the bells of the papal election conclave rang. Except for the fifty-two cardinals and their few attendants, all other personnel withdrew from the building. All doors and windows were locked. This meant that the election of the Pope could not be subjected to "external influences" in the slightest. The doors and windows were not allowed to be opened until the new Pope was elected. The cardinals had to swear that they would never act as agents of non-religious forces during the election; if elected, he would not sell out the independence of the Holy See.... Then, each person put his vote into the chalice of the "Holy Altar." When the election was inconclusive, these ballots were placed in a stove and burned with moist straw. In this way, black smoke rose from the chimney, telling people that the new Pope had not yet been elected. In this way, the election was held four times a day until a majority of two-thirds plus one vote elected a new Pope. At that time, these ballots would be burned without straw, and the people waiting in the square would see white smoke.
    The average age of these fifty-two cardinals was seventy-eight years old. Four of them were deaf, one was almost completely blind, two could no longer write, and one was carried in on a stretcher.... A British newspaper said: "No one knows exactly how they write their ballots."
    Although people were discussing, guessing, and betting, no one could explore the secrets within. Of course, the cardinals clearly knew which group he represented, who he was campaigning for, and how to defeat the candidates of another group. There is only one God, but the cardinals have different views on religion, and they each have different social connections. Western newspapers classify them as "anti-communist" bishops and "traditional" bishops, "political" bishops and "non-political" bishops. As an aside: we do not need to identify whether Pius XII belonged to the "anti-communist" or "traditional" camp; however, the US government has already used his death to carry out anti-communist activities. Before the papal election began, the United States made a request to the Hungarian government to allow Mindszenty, a counter-revolutionary hiding in the US embassy in Budapest and one of the culprits of the Hungarian incident, to go to Rome to participate in the election. British Labour Party leader Gaitskell also joined in the fun, making the same request.
    Two and a half days passed, and black smoke rose from this small chimney ten times, meaning that ten elections were inconclusive. The number of people watching the excitement in St. Peter's Square gradually decreased, and scandals spread in Rome. People began to suspect that fierce open and secret struggles seemed to be going on in this mysterious building.
    In fact, the intensity of the struggle was far more tense than outsiders guessed. A movement to elect a non-Italian Pope was gaining momentum. Some cardinals took advantage of the incident of doctors stealing documents to launch an offensive, arguing that a non-Italian should serve as Pope. The "Armenian" Cardinal Agagianian (he has been expelled from Armenia for decades), this Cossack despised by the Soviet people, carried out vigorous election campaigns in Rome. His supporters considered him the most favored non-Italian candidate. Western newspapers believed that he was an expert on "Russian Communism" and "Middle East issues." At the same time, his rhetoric was also "what tradition needs most." He not only had the support of his friend, the Italian Prime Minister, but also the influential Cardinal Spellman of New York. Spellman not only controlled some South American and Italian votes, but more importantly, he represented the wealthy New York Catholic Church. And Spellman himself was difficult to be elected. First, he was not a candidate, and second, devout Catholics did not like him. Britain's "Daily Express" wrote: "Once he becomes Pope, he will inevitably represent the Holy See in opposing atheistic communism, which may be confused with the 'Voice of America'."
    Spellman held several secret talks with Agagianian, and a campaign to campaign for Agagianian was launched. Opposing them were those bishops who opposed breaking the tradition of having an Italian Pope for four hundred years. At this time, a chance event occurred: another American Cardinal, Mooney, suddenly died. Thirty minutes before his death, he was still happily eating and smoking. That is to say, there were only fifty-one cardinals left, seventeen of whom were Italian. This meant that it was difficult for non-Italians to gather the required majority. In this way, the tense election continued until the eleventh time, when the Italian Roncalli was finally elected.
    The new Pope certainly did not fully meet the original hopes of the United States. Therefore, new activities have been launched; this is how to make the new Pope serve the foreign policy of the United States. The "New York Times," which represents American monopoly capital, wrote without concealment: "The new Pope is being elected at a time when the struggle between the church and communism is unprecedentedly fierce." Will the new Pope "believe that Pius XII's uncompromising policy towards communism must be implemented?" Or "believe that the church's attitude in dealing with the struggle against communism can be softened, or at least the church's unconditional support for Western countries can be weakened?" The newspaper's conclusion is: "The former is correct."

    梵蒂冈宝座的争夺战
    苏蓝
    梵蒂冈教皇礼拜堂的烟囱里徐徐冒出白烟。等候在圣彼得广场上的虔诚的天主教徒们，松了一口气，因为这告诉他们：新的教皇——七十七岁的朗卡利（约翰二十三世）终于被选出来了。他们从选举一开始就在这里等待，许多人整整等了三天——从26日的早晨到28日的下午。
    前教皇庇护十二世，是在10月9日逝世的。他的信徒们以隆重的仪式把他“送回天国”。当葬仪还在进行的时候，丑闻也在罗马传开了。据说，教皇的私人医生，利用他同庇护十二世的亲密关系，在教皇临终时盗走了一大批文件，其中有教皇的日记。英国的“雷诺新闻”说：其中记录着“许多耸人听闻的政治会议”。现在，这些文件已被卖给“国际报界”，或许有一天它会成为轰动西方国家的头条消息。
    当各地的红衣主教都来到梵蒂冈送葬并准备选举一个新教皇时，杜勒斯也在这时来到罗马。谁都知道，杜勒斯的“公务”很忙；他急着要到台湾去同蒋介石会谈。但是，他仍然到罗马去了一趟，美其名为“向教皇表示悼念”。我们用不着去追究：杜是基督教徒还是天主教徒，因为这对于美国国务卿并不重要。他到罗马的主要任务，是要影响新教皇的选举。使新教皇同美国国务院的外交活动更密切配合起来。
    在杜勒斯离开罗马后不久，新教皇的选举就开始了。25日下午6时，教皇选举密议室的钟声响了。除了五十二个红衣主教和他们的少数随从外，其余人员都从这所建筑物中退出。所有的门窗都上了锁。这表示，教皇的选举丝毫不能受到“外来的影响”。直到新教皇选出后，门窗才允许被打开。红衣主教们必须宣誓：他们在选举时决不作为非宗教势力的代理人；如果被选上，他将不出卖教庭的独立……。然后，每人把选票投入“圣台”的圣餐杯中。选举无结果时，就把这些选票放在一个炉子里，加上潮湿的麦秸烧掉。这样，黑烟便从烟囱中冒出，它告诉人们：新教皇还没有选出。就这样，一天选四次，直到一个有三分之二再加一票的多数选出新教皇为止。那时，这些选票将不加麦秸燃烧，等候在广场上的人们便看到了白烟。
    这五十二个红衣主教的平均年龄是七十八岁。其中四个是聋子，一个几乎全瞎了，两个已经不能写字，一个是用担架抬进去的……。英国一家报纸说：“谁也不晓得他们究竟怎样来写选票。”
    尽管人们在议论、猜测、打赌，但谁也无法探索其中的秘密。当然，红衣主教们清楚地知道他自己代表那一个集团，为谁竞选，而又如何去击败另一集团的候选人。上帝只有一个，但是，红衣主教们对于宗教却有不同的看法，他们每人都有不同的社会联系。西方国家报纸把他们分类为“反共”的主教和“传统”的主教，“政治性的”主教和“非政治性”的主教。附带注上一笔：庇护十二世究竟是属于“反共”的或“传统”的，我们没有必要去为他作鉴定；但是，美国政府却已利用他的死来进行反共活动了。美国在教皇开始选举前，向匈牙利政府提出要求，要允准躲在布达佩斯美国公使馆里的反革命分子、匈牙利事件的罪魁之一明曾蒂赴罗马参加选举。英国工党领袖盖茨克尔也夹在中间凑热闹，提出了同样的要求。
    两天半过去了，从这个小小的烟囱中冒出了十次黑烟，也就是说，十次选举都无结果。圣彼得广场上看热闹的人逐渐减少，罗马城内丑闻流传。人们开始猜疑：在这座神秘莫测的建筑物中，似乎进行着激烈的明争暗斗。
    事实上，斗争的激烈程度，远比外界人所猜测的更要紧张。一个选非意大利教皇的运动，来势颇凶。某些红衣主教利用医生偷盗文件的事件，发动一个攻势，主张应由非意大利人来担任教皇。“亚美尼亚”红衣主教阿季节安尼安（他被赶出亚美尼亚已有几十年了），这个被苏联人民所唾弃的哥萨克人，在罗马大肆进行竞选活动。他的支持者，认为他是最中意的非意大利候选人。西方报纸认为，他是一个“俄国共产主义”和“中东问题”专家。同时他的言论也是“最近传统所需要的”。他不但得到他的朋友、意大利总理的支持，还有纽约红衣主教史培尔曼这个有势力的人物。史培尔曼不仅控制着一些南美和意大利的选票，更重要的是他代表着富足的纽约天主教堂。而史培尔曼本人是很难当选的。首先，他并不是一个候选人，其次，虔诚的天主教徒并不喜欢他。英国“每日快报”写道：“他一旦成为教皇，必然代表教庭去反对无神论的共产主义，这，可能和‘美国之音’混淆起来。”
    史培尔曼曾数度和阿季节安尼安进行密谈，一个为阿季节安尼安进行竞选的运动展开了。同他们对立的，是那些反对破坏四百年来都是意大利人教皇的传统的主教们。这时候，一个偶然事件发生了：美国另一红衣主教莫奈突然死去，他在死前三十分钟，还高高兴兴地吃饭、抽烟。这就是说，只剩下了五十一个红衣主教，其中十七个是意大利人。这意味着非意大利人已很难凑够需要的多数。就这样，紧张的选举一直进行到第十一次时，意大利人朗卡利终于当选。
    新的教皇当然并不完全符合美国原来的希望，因此，新的活动展开了；这就是怎样使新的教皇为美国的外交政策服务。代表美国垄断资本的“纽约时报”毫不掩饰地写道：“新的教皇是在教会同共产主义的斗争空前激烈的时候进行选举的。”新的教皇将“相信庇护十二世对共产主义的不妥协政策必须贯彻下去呢？”还是“认为在对付共产主义的斗争中教会的态度可以软化，或者认为至少可以削弱教会对西方国家的无条件支持？”这个报纸的结论是：“前者是正确的。”
