Implementing Dedicated Transport Lines: Steel Generals Advance Unhindered
Bengbu Prefecture: Automobiles, Horse-drawn Carts, and Pedestrians Each Have Their Own Lanes, Transport Volume More Than Doubles

(Our dispatch) Bengbu Special District, Anhui Province, in the rush to transport refractory materials and coke gemstones, relied on the masses, implemented dedicated transport lines, and tapped the potential of transportation tools in many ways, increasing transport volume by two to three times compared to the past. Wang Shoudao, Minister of Communications, inspected the transportation situation here and gave this approach a high evaluation. He said: Your experience in organizing dedicated transportation lines is successful. It is a red banner for the whole country and should be promoted well.

The Lieshan area of Bengbu Prefecture is rich in coke gemstones. The refractory materials needed for the large-scale steel industry in various parts of Anhui are mostly mined and supplied from here. When trucks carrying coke gemstones were transported to Fuliji to be loaded onto trains for shipment, they were constantly blocked by horse-drawn carts, flatbed carts, and ox carts competing for road space, and pedestrians also crisscrossed the road. Despite the driver's strenuous honking, obstacles remained, making it difficult to pass. On this only twenty-six-kilometer-long road, a truck could not even make four round trips a day, and sometimes it could only make one or two trips. More than forty trucks could not transport 1,000 tons of coke gemstones a day, far short of the 3,000 tons per day task assigned by higher authorities. This was the situation before September 20th.

Starting in late September, dedicated transport lines were implemented here, completely changing the previous situation of congested roads and immobile trucks. Along the road from Lieshan to Fuliji Railway Station, tens of thousands of farmers were mobilized and worked hard for three days and three nights to widen the road by one time and open a simple auxiliary road next to it. In this way, pedestrians could use the auxiliary road, the highway was dedicated to trucks, and horse-drawn carts and flatbed carts participating in transportation took another road from Lieshan to the Suxian Railway Station. As a result, trucks could drive at high speed on the wide highway without any obstacles. The turnover rate of trucks immediately increased by about two times, and at most they could make twelve round trips a day, and at least six round trips. The transport volume of coke gemstones surged to more than 3,000 tons per day, with a maximum of 3,450 tons transported in one day.

In order to not waste a minute of transportation tool's time, various supporting tasks here were also done very well. The loading and unloading yards for ore were expanded and increased, and farmers, students, and family members of workers helped with loading and unloading. Truck dispatch rooms, gas stations, and repair teams were all set up at the loading and unloading yards. Drivers could use the space between loading and unloading goods to complete procedures and refuel their trucks, and repair workers also used this time to "check the body" of the trucks. The "Support Canteen" and "Leap Forward Canteen" organized by government cadres and citizens provided meals day and night, and transportation personnel could eat whenever they arrived. Mass road repair and maintenance work was also done very well.

After the implementation of dedicated transport lines, not only was the task of transporting coke gemstones guaranteed to be completed smoothly, but also empty transportation tools were used to transport large quantities of seeds, grain, coal, and other materials, driving the entire transportation work forward.

    实行专线运输　钢帅通行无阻
    蚌埠专区汽车马车行人各走专道、运输量猛增两倍以上
    本报讯　安徽省蚌埠专区在赶运耐火材料焦宝石时，依靠群众，实行专线运输，并从多方面挖掘运输工具的潜力，使运输量比过去提高了两三倍。交通部部长王首道视察了这里的运输情况以后，对这一作法给予很高的评价。他说：你们组织专线运输的经验是成功的，在全国来说是一面红旗，应该很好推广。
    蚌埠专区的烈山地区，盛产焦宝石。安徽各地大办钢铁工业所需要的耐火材料大都由这里开采、供应。当汽车载着焦宝石运往符离集准备装火车外运的时候，一路上总是不断地被相互抢路的马车、板车和牛车挡住，行人也穿来穿去，尽管司机使劲按喇叭，仍然是阻碍重重，很难通过。在这只有二十六公里长的公路上，一辆汽车一天还跑不了四个来回，有时一天只能跑一两趟。四十多辆汽车一天运不出一千吨焦宝石，同上级规定的每天运出三千吨的任务相差很远。这是9月20日以前的情况。
    从9月下旬开始，这里实行了专线运输，彻底改变了以前公路拥挤，汽车开不动的局面。在从烈山到符离集火车站的公路沿线，发动了上万的农民，苦战三天三夜，把公路修宽了一倍，又在路旁开辟了简易的副道。这样行人可走副道，公路专门给汽车跑，参加运输的马车、板车走另一条由烈山通往宿县火车站的公路。结果，汽车在宽畅的公路上能高速行驶，不受任何阻碍。汽车的运转率一下提高了两倍左右，最多一天能跑十二个来回，最少也能跑六个来回。焦宝石的运输量激增到每天三千吨以上，最多的一天运出三千四百五十吨。
    为了不让运输工具白白浪费一分钟，这里的各种配合工作也作得很出色。装卸矿石的货场扩大了，增加了，农民、学生、职工家属都帮助装卸。汽车的调度室、加油站、修理组都设在装卸场上，司机可以利用装卸货物的空隙，办理手续和给汽车加油，修理工人也在这时为汽车“检查身体”。由机关干部、市民组织的“支援食堂”、“跃进食堂”，日夜供给饭菜，运输人员随到随吃。群众性的修路养路工作也做得很好。
    实行专线运输以后，不但保证了运送焦宝石任务的顺利完成，还利用回空的交通工具，运送了大批种籽、粮食、煤炭等物资，把整个运输工作带动了起来。
