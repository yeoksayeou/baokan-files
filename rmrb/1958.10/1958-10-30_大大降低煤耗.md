    Greatly Reduce Coal Consumption
    To resolve the current contradiction of insufficient coal supply, in addition to vigorously increasing production, there is another positive approach: to make every effort to conserve coal consumption. The recent coal consumption reduction campaign launched by Jiangsu Province throughout the province is of great significance.
    The main reason for insufficient coal is certainly insufficient production and untimely supply, but high consumption is also one of the reasons for the supply shortage. According to the recent information obtained by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the coal consumed to produce one ton of iron is generally more than eight to ten tons. Individually, the highest consumption of some furnace groups even reaches sixteen tons. This situation may also exist in other regions.
    Why is coal consumption so high? First, the smelting technology is not well mastered. Some places only care about producing iron, regardless of how much coal is consumed, and a large amount of coal is burned in vain. According to a statistic from a district in Wuxi, the coal consumed to produce one ton of iron is as high as twenty-seven tons. However, some furnaces have greatly reduced coal consumption because they have paid attention to the research and improvement of coal consumption. The iron-smelting furnace of Wuxi Shenxin Textile Factory has reduced coal consumption to a ratio of 1:1.77, that is, it only consumes 1.77 tons of coal to produce one ton of iron; the 1 cubic meter furnace of Suzhou Minfeng Boiler Factory produced more than 7 tons of iron in seven days, while the average coal consumption was only about 0.57 tons. One is 1:27, and the other is 1:0.57. What a huge difference in numbers! This shows that improving smelting technology, improving operation methods, and improving ingredient ratios can greatly reduce coal consumption and allow us to produce more iron with the least amount of coal. Jiangsu Province has proposed to launch a technical revolution centered on reducing coal consumption in this high-yield steel movement, taking reducing coal consumption as an important subject of the technical revolution, and requiring the average coal consumption of all indigenous furnaces in the province to be reduced to 1:4, and the coal consumption of foreign blast furnaces to be reduced to 1:2. If this level can be reached, the coal shortage can be alleviated. Secondly, in the process of transportation and coking, the consumption of coal is also very large. Coal has to be transported from the place of production to the edge of the blast furnace and moved up and down several times by vehicles and ships, and the loss along the way is considerable. In the large-scale indigenous coking, some places have a very low coke yield due to the lack of good mastery of technology. On construction sites and coking yards, piles of coal dust are piled up everywhere, and they have not been fully utilized.
    The above situation fully shows that if we try our best to pay attention to saving coal consumption from all aspects, the potential of coal is still very large. In the early stage of the mass campaign of steelmaking by the whole people, it was understandable to use more coal because many people had not yet mastered the iron-smelting technology. But now the situation has changed, and the technical barrier of iron-smelting has basically passed. It is unforgivable to allow waste in terms of coal consumption. Coal is the grain of the steel industry. With sufficient coal, a large amount of iron and steel can be produced; otherwise, the task of steel production will be seriously threatened. Therefore, in addition to vigorously increasing coal production, how to use the least amount of coal to produce more iron has also become a very important link. Those one-sided views of "only caring about producing iron, regardless of coal consumption" and "not being afraid of waste if you want to produce iron" should be strictly criticized.
    Reducing coal consumption and tapping the potential of coal is also a positive aspect of overcoming the current coal difficulties. Jiangsu Province's practice is worth promoting throughout the country. If all parts of the country can make positive efforts in both increasing production and saving, we may be able to change the tense situation of insufficient coal in a not very long time, and make the steel industry leap forward at a faster speed!

### 大大降低煤耗

    大大降低煤耗
    解决目前煤炭供应不足的矛盾，除大力增产外，还有一条积极的途径，就是千方百计节约煤的消耗。江苏省最近在全省开展了一个降低煤耗的运动，是有很大意义的。
    煤炭不够的主要原因固然是生产不足，供应不及时，但消耗量大也是造成供应紧张的原因之一。根据江苏省委最近掌握的情况，出一吨铁所耗用的煤一般都在八吨到十吨以上。个别的炉群最高竟达到十六吨。这种情况在其他地区可能也是存在的。
    为什么煤耗这样大？第一，是冶炼的技术掌握得不好，有些地方只顾出铁，不管煤耗多少，大量的煤被白白烧掉。据无锡一个区统计，一吨铁所耗用的煤竟要二十七吨。但有些炉子因注意了对煤耗的研究和改进，煤耗就大大的降低。无锡申新纺织厂的炼铁炉，煤耗已降到一比一点七七，即出一吨铁只要消耗一点七七吨煤；苏州民丰锅厂一立方公尺的炉子，七天时间产铁七吨多，平均煤耗却在零点五七吨左右。一个是一比二十七，一个是一比零点五七，这是两个多么悬殊的数字！这说明，改进冶炼技术，改进操作方法和配料比例，就可能大大降低煤耗，就可能用最少的煤炼出更多的铁来。江苏省提出要在这次钢铁高额丰产运动中，开展一个以降低煤耗为中心的技术革命，把降低煤耗作为技术革命的重要课题，要求全省所有土炉子的平均煤耗降低到一比四，洋高炉的煤耗降低到一比二。如果能达到这个水平，就可以减轻煤炭的紧张情势。其次在运输和炼焦过程中，煤的消耗也很大，煤从产地运到高炉边，要经过好几道车船上下搬运，沿途损耗的数字相当可观。在大搞土法炼焦中，有些地方因没有很好的掌握技术，出焦率很低。在工地上、炼焦场上，到处都堆了成堆的煤屑，没有被充分利用起来。
    以上情况充分说明：如果想尽千方百计，从一切环节上来注意节约煤耗，煤的潜力还是很大的。在全民大办钢铁的初期，因为许多人还没有掌握出铁技术，多用些煤是可以谅解的。但现在情况变了，炼铁的技术关已经基本上过去了，如果在用煤方面听其浪费，这是不能原谅的。煤是钢铁工业的粮食，有了足够的煤炭，才可以大量出铁出钢，否则，钢铁生产的任务就将受到严重的威胁。因此，我们除了大力增产煤炭以外，如何使用最少的煤炼出更多的铁来，也成了一个很重要的环节。那些“只顾出铁，不顾煤耗”、“要出铁就不怕浪费”的片面观点，应该受到严格的批判。
    降低煤耗，挖掘煤的潜力，这也是克服目前煤炭困难的一个积极方面。江苏省的做法很值得在全国推广。如果全国各地都能在增产和节约这两个方面作积极的努力，我们就有可能在不要很长的时间内，改变煤炭不够的紧张局面，使钢铁工业以更快的速度飞跃前进！
