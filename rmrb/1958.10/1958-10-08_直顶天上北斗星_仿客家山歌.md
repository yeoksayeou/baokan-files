    Straight to the Big Dipper in the Sky
    ——Imitation of Hakka Folk Song
    Xiao Yin
   Outside the village, a golden scene,
   Ears of grain stretching for thousands of acres;
   Crisscrossing streams cannot divide,
   Mountains connected to mountains, gold connected to gold.
   Gazing afar, one cannot see the end,
   Vast and boundless, deeper than the sea;
   Don't say it's hard for egrets to fly over,
   Even eagles worry when they take flight.
   Partridges sing praise, "Good harvest!"
   Laughing willow branches also bend!
   If grain kernels are piled into a mountain,
   The grain pile will surely reach the top of the heavenly gate;
   Don't say it will break through the clouds on the ridge,
   It will go straight to the Big Dipper in the sky!

    直顶天上北斗星
    ——仿客家山歌
    萧殷
   村庄外面一片金，
   谷穗绵绵连千顷；
   纵横小溪隔不断，
   山连山来金连金。
   放眼四望望不尽，
   渺渺茫茫比海深；
   莫说白鹭难飞过，
   老鹰飞起也担心。
   鹧鸪连声赞“谷好！”
   笑的柳枝也弯身！
   若把谷粒堆成山，
   谷堆定插天门顶；
   莫说顶破岭上云，
   直顶天上北斗星！
