    Rush Pig Iron to Steel Plants
    A commentator from this newspaper
    After two months of hard struggle, the national steel production has surged, especially the growth rate of pig iron production is particularly fast. Now, the most important issue is to quickly transport pig iron to various steel plants, especially key steel plants, for steelmaking. Currently, the inability to transport pig iron has seriously affected the production of some key steel plants. Failure to solve this problem will inevitably affect the completion of this year's and even next year's steel production plans. Therefore, immediately transporting pig iron produced in various regions, especially high-quality pig iron, to meet the needs of key steel plants in various regions is a top priority at present.
    To transport pig iron, the first step is to vigorously build roads. This year, everyone is involved in iron smelting, and more than half of the pig iron is scattered in smelting points in counties, townships, and communes. These smelting points are not only far from railway lines but also a considerable distance from highways and major shipping routes. To transport this pig iron from all over the mountains and fields to steel plants, relying solely on the efforts of railway, highway, and shipping departments is not enough. The most important issue is to build roads to concentrate pig iron scattered in various smelting points to railway lines, highways, and shipping lines. The original transportation lines, due to the surge in traffic and the presence of large numbers of vehicles, have experienced traffic congestion, which also needs to be widened. Especially with the promotion of automobile trainization, the roads originally adapted to single-vehicle traffic urgently need to be renovated. Therefore, all regions must seize the time to establish steel transportation lines. All earthen blast furnace clusters capable of normal and large-scale production must have road access. Various roads must be built according to the needs of traffic volume and different transportation tools. All highways with automobile train traffic must improve steep slopes and turning radii to adapt to the needs of trailer transportation development. All busy routes must be paved with gravel surfaces and bridges and culverts must be consolidated to strengthen the road's traffic capacity.
    Under the current situation of tight labor, it is relatively difficult to extract a large amount of labor to build roads, but the problem is that it is even more difficult not to build roads. How much labor will it take to carry things on one's back and walk on rugged roads if roads are not built? Extracting people to build roads is temporarily tense, but once the roads are built, vehicles can travel, which can save a lot of labor. Weighing the pros and cons, building roads is naturally better; and road construction, as long as it is well organized, does not require much labor. Yuxian County in Henan Province mobilized more than 10,000 people and, after only two days and nights of hard work, paved gravel on 107 kilometers of roads on five trunk lines, basically ensuring the needs of steel transportation. It can be seen that although rural labor is currently tight, it is entirely possible to build roads in a concentrated manner through mass movements.
    With roads, there must also be vehicles. In this regard, attention should be paid to organizing all folk transportation tools. Currently, not only is automobile transportation capacity insufficient, but also folk transportation tools are also in short supply. Before agricultural cooperativization, a considerable portion of folk transportation tools were engaged in sideline transportation, and their proportion greatly exceeded that of professional transportation vehicles. After agricultural cooperativization, the mules and horse-drawn carts that were originally engaged in transportation sidelines have all been transferred to agricultural production, and the remaining professional transportation vehicles are insufficient to cope with the greatly increased transportation tasks at present. The key to solving the shortage of vehicles, in addition to continuing to work hard to promote automobile trainization and implementing double-shift or even triple-shift transportation methods, the most realistic method is to organize all available folk transportation tools, whether they are horse-drawn carts, ox carts, wheelbarrows, handcarts, or bicycles. Everything that can be organized must be organized and put into the steel transportation front. Of course, the tasks of autumn planting and harvesting are also very heavy, but experience has proven that as long as we are good at overall planning, steel transportation and agricultural production can be coordinated. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to transfer 50% of folk transportation vehicles to professional transportation, which not only ensured the needs of steel transportation but also did not affect agricultural production. It can be seen that the potential of folk transportation tools is still very large.
    With roads and transportation tools, it is also necessary to strengthen traffic management and rectify transportation order. Judging from the current situation, the transportation order on some traffic trunk lines is not good enough. Cars, horse-drawn carts, ox carts, wheelbarrows, and bicycles all squeeze onto the road, which affects the speed of cars and is prone to accidents. This situation must be changed and can be changed. In order to accelerate the turnover of cars, Nanyang Prefecture in Henan Province adopted the relay transportation method, setting up three transfer stations in Neixiang, Fangcheng, and Nanyang to transfer the import and export materials of seven counties near Nanyang. In this way, cars do not have to go to the counties, which improves transportation efficiency and also gives play to the enthusiasm of the masses in various counties. After implementing this method, according to statistics from the Nanyang transfer station, the transportation volume has doubled. The news published in this newspaper today about the Bengbu Prefecture in Anhui Province organizing specialized transportation lines, with people carrying and shouldering, horse-drawn carts, flatbed carts, and cars each taking specialized lines, although the road is busy, the transportation order is in good order, and the transportation efficiency is increased by two or three times, is also an important experience. These examples show that when seizing roads and vehicles, especially folk transportation vehicles, the transportation organization work must also be done well. Otherwise, even if there are roads and vehicles, there will be a phenomenon of large numbers of vehicles on the road and traffic congestion, and the task still cannot be completed well.
    In addition, it is also necessary to further strengthen handling work and loading and unloading work, and take all measures to prevent congestion. At present, due to untimely loading and unloading and low efficiency in some areas, the turnover of vehicles and ships has been seriously affected. These areas must promote the experience of "ants moving Mount Tai" in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, organize forces to rush to transport backlog of materials, especially along railway and highway lines, to achieve immediate loading and unloading upon arrival, no accumulation of goods, and no stagnation of vehicles. At the same time, we must actively carry out technological innovation to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading operations.
    Finally, when transferring pig iron, we should give priority to transporting good iron first. The quality of pig iron has a great impact on the quality of steel. Currently, the pig iron smelted by earthen furnaces in various regions is sometimes of poor quality and cannot be directly used for steelmaking or casting. If good and bad are not separated and all these pig iron are transported, it will waste transportation capacity and not help steelmaking. Therefore, the Party committees in various regions must make it clear to the masses to concentrate the best pig iron in a timely manner and send it to steel plants in their own provinces or other provinces.
    Smelting iron is for smelting steel. Now we have smelted a lot of pig iron, which is a great victory. But the important thing is still steelmaking. Failure to transport pig iron to steel plants in a timely manner will inevitably lead to failure. It is hoped that all regions will immediately organize forces to transport pig iron and good iron to steel plants.

    为钢厂赶运生铁
    本报评论员
    经过两个月的苦战，全国钢铁产量猛增，特别是生铁产量的增长速度尤快。现在最重要的问题是，赶快把生铁运到各个钢厂、特别是各个重点钢厂去炼钢。目前由于生铁运不出来，已严重影响了一些重点钢厂的生产。这个问题不解决，势必影响到今年、甚至明年炼钢生产计划的完成。因此，立即把各地生产的生铁、特别是质量好的生铁运出来，供应各地重点钢厂的需要，是当前一项急迫的头等重要任务。
    要把生铁运出来，首先要大力修建道路，今年是全民炼铁，半数以上的生铁都分散在各县、乡、社的冶炼点上。这些冶炼点不仅大都远离铁路线，而且距公路线、航运干线也有很长的距离。要把这些满山遍野的生铁运到炼钢厂去，光靠铁路部门、公路部门、航运部门努力是不够的；最重要的问题，是修建道路，把分散在各个冶炼点上的生铁集中到铁路线、公路线和航运线上来。原有的运输线路由于运量猛增，千军万马上路，出现了车辆堵塞的现象，也需要拓宽；特别是随着汽车列车化的推广，原来适应于行驶单车的道路也亟待改造。因此，各地必须抓紧时间把钢铁运输线建立起来，凡能正常生产、大量生产的土高炉群，都要有路可通，根据运量和不同运输工具的需要，修建各种不同的道路；凡有汽车列车通行的公路，都要改善陡坡和弯道半径，适应拖挂运输发展的需要；凡是运输繁忙的路线，都要增铺石子路面，巩固桥梁涵洞，以加强道路的通过能力。
    在当前劳动力紧张的情况下，抽出大批人力来修路，是比较困难的；但问题是不修路更困难。不修路靠人背，在崎岖的道路上行走，要耗费多少劳动力？抽出人来修路，暂时紧张一些；但路修好了，可以走车子，就能节省大量的劳动力。权衡利弊，自然是修路好；而且修路只要组织得好，也不需多少劳动力。河南禹县发动万余群众，只苦战了两昼夜，就在五条干线一百零七公里的路面上铺上了石子，基本上保证了钢铁运输的需要。可见，尽管目前农村劳力紧张，但是，用群众运动的方式突击修路，是完全可能办到的。
    有了道路，还要有车辆。在这方面，应该注意把一切民间运输工具组织起来。目前不仅汽车运力不够，而且民间运输工具也感不足。在农业合作化以前，民间运输工具有相当部分是搞副业运输的，其比例大大超过了专业运输车辆。农业合作化以后，原来搞运输副业的骡马大车，都先后转到农业生产方面去了，剩下来的专业运输车辆就不足以应付目前大大增加了的运输任务。解决车辆不足的关键，除了继续努力推广汽车列车化、实行双班制以至三班制等等运输方法以外，最现实的办法，就是把一切能够利用的民间运输工具都组织起来，不论马车、牛车、架子车、手推车和自行车，凡是可以组织的，都要把它们组织起来投入钢铁运输战线。当然，秋种秋收的任务也很繁重，但经验证明，只要我们善于全面安排，钢铁运输和农业生产是可以统筹兼顾的。中共陕西省委决定调出50％的民间运输车辆转入专业运输，这样既保证了钢铁运输的需要，也不影响农业生产。可见，民间运输工具的潜力还是很大的。
    有了道路，有了运输工具，还要加强交通管理，整顿运输秩序。从目前情况来看，部分交通干线的运输秩序还不够好，汽车、马车、牛车、架子车、自行车一齐挤到公路上，既影响汽车时速又易肇事。这种情况必须改变而且也能改变。河南省南阳专区为了加速汽车的周转，采取接力运输的办法，在内乡、方城、南阳设立了三个中转站，转运南阳附近七个县的出入物资，这样汽车可以不下县，提高了运输效率，同时也发挥了各县群众的积极性，实行这种办法后，据南阳中转站统计，运量提高了一倍。今天本报发表的安徽蚌埠专区组织专线运输，人挑、肩背，马车、板车和汽车各走专线，虽然沿线车水马龙，但运输秩序井然，运输效率提高二、三倍的新闻，也是一项重要的经验。这些事例说明，抓路抓车特别是抓民间运输车辆的时候，还必须把运输组织工作做好，否则，即使有路有车，也会出现千军万马上路、交通堵塞的现象，仍然不能很好完成任务。
    此外，还要进一步加强搬运工作和装卸工作，采取一切措施，防止堵塞。目前部分地区由于装卸不够及时，效率低，已经严重影响了车船的周转。这些地方必须推广江苏省常州市“蚂蚁搬泰山”的经验，组织力量突击搬运积压物资，特别是铁路和公路沿线，要做到随来随装，随到随卸，货无积压，车无停滞。同时还要积极开展技术革新，实现装卸操作机械化、半机械化。
    最后，在调运生铁时，应该尽先把好铁运出来。生铁的质量对钢的质量有很大的影响。目前各地用土炉炼的生铁中，有些质量不很好，不能直接用于炼钢，也不能直接用于铸造。如果不分好坏，把这些生铁都运出来，既浪费了运力，也无助于炼钢。因此，各地党委必须向群众说清楚，把最好的生铁及时集中起来，送到本省的或者外省的炼钢厂去。
    炼铁是为了炼钢。现在我们已经炼出很多生铁来，这是一个巨大的胜利。但重要的还在于炼钢。不能及时把生铁运到炼钢厂去，就难免功亏一篑。希望各地立即组织力量，为钢厂运生铁、运好铁。
