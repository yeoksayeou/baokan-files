    The Whereabouts of Two Suggestions
    In the summer of 1954, I went to work in Tangshan from Hangzhou. At that time, the Jinpu Railway and the Shanghai-Nanjing line were experiencing floods. I spent four days and four nights on the road, either stopping and waiting for the train or transferring midway. Moving the luggage around was indeed exhausting.
    Later, every time I returned south for vacation, I had to transfer trains at least twice in Tianjin and Shanghai. Due to the crowding of passengers, sometimes I had to wait one or two days in Tianjin. Sometimes, seeing that the situation was not good, we would switch to local trains, which meant having to transfer again in Jinan, Xuzhou, Pukou, and other places. The children always said:
    "Dad, wouldn't it be great if there was a direct train from the Northeast to Hangzhou?"
    After returning to Hangzhou, the children brought up this matter again, so we wrote a suggestion proposing that the railway bureau start a direct train from Shenyang to Hangzhou. Later, we received a reply saying that it was being studied, but it would be difficult to realize it for the time being.
    This spring, the vigorous Double-Anti movement began. The children suggested raising this matter again. They also said that the platform ticket price of one jiao per ticket was too high and unreasonable. I felt they were right, so I wrote two suggestions.
    In early June, the newspapers published the changes to the summer train schedule. Upon closer inspection, a direct express train from Shanghai to Shenyang had indeed been added. I told the children, and they were all very happy.
    Yesterday, we went to see someone off. As usual, I gave the ticket seller one jiao for each platform ticket. I took three platform tickets and started to leave, but the ticket seller loudly called me back, saying that I had overpaid! I looked closely and saw that the printed ticket price "0.10 yuan" had a red stamp of "0.05 yuan" added. I took the one jiao and five fen change with a smile and left the service counter!

    两条意见的下落
    1954年暑假，我从杭州到唐山工作，当时正值津浦路、沪宁路线闹水灾，在路上呆了四天四夜，不是停车候车，就是中途转车，行李东搬西移，确实劳累不堪。
    后来，每逢假期南返，至少也得在天津、上海转二次车，由于乘客拥挤，有时在天津得等一二天；有时看情况不好，我们就改搭区间车，这样还得在济南、徐州、浦口等地再转车，孩子们总是说：
    “爸爸，从东北开一次直达车到杭州多好呢？”
    回到杭州后，孩子们又提起了这件事，我们就写了一个意见，建议铁路局开一次沈阳到杭州的直达列车，后来接到答复说正在研究，但一时恐难实现。
    今年春天，轰轰烈烈的双反运动开始了，孩子们说再把这件事提上去，他们还说月台票一角一张，价目也太高，不合理。我觉得很对，就写了二条意见。
    6月初旬，报纸上发表了改变夏季行车时间，仔细一看，果然增开了一趟从上海到沈阳的直达快车，我告诉孩子们，他们都非常高兴。
    昨天，我们去送客，我照例给售票同志每张月台票一角钱，我拿了三张月台票就走，但售票同志大声的招呼我回去，说我多给钱了！我仔细一看，印好的票价“．10元”上加盖了“．05元”的红字，我拿着找给我的一角五分钱，满含微笑地离了服务台！
