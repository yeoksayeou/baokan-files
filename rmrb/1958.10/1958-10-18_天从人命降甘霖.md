Heaven Sends Sweet Rain According to Human Will

	In February of this year, the Soviet Union used artificial methods to clear away a cloud cover over Moscow, creating rainfall. Following this, meteorological bureaus and other units in Jilin and Gansu provinces in our country also successfully experimented with artificial rainmaking. This is the beginning of "heavenly time" listening to human will.

	These artificial rainmaking efforts all used dry ice. People used airplanes to carry the dry ice into the high altitudes and scatter it, and soon the rain obediently fell.

	Did the dry ice turn into rain? No, because dry ice is not composed of water at all, it only looks like dry ice on the surface. In fact, its composition is carbon dioxide, which is the carbonic acid gas produced by biological respiration, the decay of organic matter, and the burning of fuel. Under normal circumstances, carbon dioxide exists in a gaseous state. If it is subjected to pressure and cooling, it will become a liquid. If the liquid carbon dioxide is sprayed from a tube, a portion of the sprayed carbon dioxide will condense into something like snowflakes, which is dry ice.

	From this, it can be seen that the water that forms artificial rain is originally present in the air.

	Clouds are composed of countless tiny water droplets, which are often cooled to minus twenty or thirty degrees Celsius without freezing, so they are called supercooled water droplets. If the temperature drops sharply again, the supercooled water droplets may form larger ice crystals, forming snowfall or rainfall.

	Scattering dry ice into the air is to create conditions for a sharp drop in temperature. It should be known that the boiling point of carbon dioxide is minus seventy-eight degrees Celsius. Although the temperature at high altitude is also below zero degrees Celsius, it is much higher than the boiling point of carbon dioxide. Therefore, when dry ice is scattered into high altitude, it evaporates rapidly, just like pouring water into a raging fire, the water will evaporate violently. Evaporation requires heat absorption. Therefore, when dry ice evaporates, the temperature drops sharply, causing the supercooled water droplets in the high altitude to quickly condense into larger ice crystals, which is artificial snow. If the temperature in the lower layers is quite warm, the artificial snow will melt into raindrops, becoming artificial rain.

	Sometimes, moisture in the air cannot condense and fall because there are not enough particles to serve as the cores needed for condensation. After the dry ice is scattered, it first exists in a particulate state and floats in the air, so these particles themselves also have the effect of promoting rainfall.

	In addition to being used for dispersing clouds and making rain, dry ice can also be used for refrigerating food. In this use, it is much superior to ice. Because dry ice evaporates directly into a gas, it is not as annoying as the wetness of using ice, and the gas that is produced is carbon dioxide, which also has the function of preventing food oxidation and spoilage. In terms of the low temperature produced, the effect of dry ice is also much higher, because the low temperature created by ice is only zero degrees Celsius or near zero degrees Celsius, while dry ice can reach minus seventy-eight degrees Celsius. In addition, dry ice can be used to create smoke screens on stage. Dry ice can also be used as explosives, fire extinguishers... with very good results.

    天从人命降甘霖
    曰文
    今年2月，苏联用人工方法在莫斯科上空扫清了一片云雾，造成
  了降雨。接着，我国吉林省和甘肃省气象局等单位也先后试验人造雨成功。这是“天时”听从人命的开始。
    这几次人工造雨，都是用的干冰。人们用飞机把干冰带到高空撒出，不久，雨就乖乖地下起来了。
    是不是干冰变成了雨呢？不是，因为干冰根本不是由水组成的，只不过在外表上很像干燥的冰而已。实际上它的成份是二氧化碳，也就是生物的呼吸、有机体的腐烂、燃料的燃烧等所生成的碳酸气。在普通情况下，二氧化碳是呈气体状态而存在的。如果把它加以压力和冷却，则会变成液体。再让液体的二氧化碳从管中喷出，一部分喷出的二氧化碳便凝成雪花一样的东西，这就是干冰。
    由此可见，形成人造雨的水分，是本来就存在于空气中的。
    朵朵的云块，就是由无数的细微水滴所组成，这种水滴往往冷到零下二、三十度也不冻结，所以称之为过冷的水滴。如果气温再急剧下降，过冷的水滴就可能结成较大的冰晶，形成降雪或降雨。
    把干冰撒到空气中，就是要造成气温急剧下降的条件。要知道，二氧化碳的沸点是零下七十八度C，高空的温度虽然也在零度C以下，但究竟比二氧化碳的沸点高得多，所以把干冰撒到高空中，它就迅速蒸发。正好像把水泼到熊熊的炉火中，水会激烈地蒸发一样。蒸发是要吸热的，因此，当干冰蒸发时，气温便急剧下降，使高空中的过冷水滴很快地凝结为较大的冰晶，这就是人造雪。如果下层的气温相当温暖，人造雪便化为雨滴，成为人造雨。
    有时，空中水分不能凝聚下降，是由于缺乏足够的微粒作为凝聚所需要的核心的原故。干冰撒出后，首先便是呈微粒状态而漂浮于空气中的，所以这种微粒本身也有促成降雨的作用。
    干冰除了用于消云造雨以外，还可以用于冷藏食物。在这一种用途上，它比冰要优越得多。因为干冰蒸发时会直接变成气体，不像用冰时的湿漉漉那样讨厌，并且变成的气是二氧化碳，还有防止食物氧化和腐败的功能。如果就产生的低温来说，干冰的效果也高得很多，因为用冰所造成的低温不过是零度C或零度C附近的零下温度，而用干冰则可以达到零下七十八度C。此外，舞台上还可以用干冰来制造烟幕。用干冰来作炸药、灭火剂……效果也很良好。
