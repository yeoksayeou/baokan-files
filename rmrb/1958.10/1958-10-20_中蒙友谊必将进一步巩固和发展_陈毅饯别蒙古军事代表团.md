Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: Marshal Chen Yi hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to the Mongolian Military Delegation to China, which is about to return home.

At the banquet, Marshal Chen Yi said that the Military Delegation of the Mongolian People's Republic, headed by Lieutenant General Dorj, has paid a friendly visit to our country for more than twenty days and is now about to leave for home. As we and all the comrades of the delegation are about to part, we feel infinitely sad.

Marshal Chen Yi said that both China and Mongolia are members of the socialist family. In the cause of opposing common enemies and defending world peace, we have long established and developed brotherly friendship. At present, our people are opposing the armed provocations of the United States military in the Taiwan Strait and opposing U.S. imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan. The fraternal Mongolian people have given us sincere support for our people's struggle.

Marshal Chen Yi firmly believes that the visit of the Mongolian Military Delegation to our country will surely promote mutual understanding between the people and armies of our two countries, and will surely further consolidate and develop our fighting friendship.

Lieutenant General Dorj said in his speech that over the past twenty days, the Mongolian Military Delegation has personally witnessed the amazing achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in production and construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the north and south of China. At the same time, we have also seen the new achievements made by all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and improving their military and political levels. All of these have given us extremely deep impressions.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Grand General Huang Kecheng, Grand General Wang Shusheng, Senior General Zhang Zongxun, Senior General Li Juikui, Air Force Senior General Liu Yalou, Senior General Guo Tianmin, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Yuan Ziqin, Navy Lieutenant General Fang Qiang, Air Force Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun, and Vice Ministers of Public Security Yang Qiqing and Wang Jinxiang.

Lubusan, Ambassador of the Mongolian People's Republic to China, and his wife, as well as military attachés from various countries to China, were also invited to attend the banquet.
