    The Philosophy of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Leap Forward of Philosophy

    Along with the Great Leap Forward of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, the development and improvement of philosophy will inevitably be triggered. This is the idea discussed in the article "The Philosophy of the Great Leap Forward and the Great Leap Forward of Philosophy" published in the sixth issue of "Philosophical Research" by Comrade Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The author states that our country is currently in a new historical period, as Engels predicted in his early years, where humanity truly elevates itself from the rest of the animal kingdom, takes the initiative, and becomes the master of society and nature. However, such a society is not realized all at once. The liberation of people's minds, the unleashing of the potential of the masses, and the exertion of human subjective initiative are not achieved overnight either. In order to turn the objective possibility of a great leap forward in productivity into reality, the promotion of human consciousness and subjective effort is needed. Therefore, it is also necessary to solve the problems of people's thinking, their drive, and what laws and paths people should follow to work. People are the main factor in the Great Leap Forward. Only when people unleash their potential can things play their role. Therefore, to study the laws of people's leap forward, we must first study the masses who create miracles and promote the Great Leap Forward. The author further states that to understand this issue, one cannot cut off the history of the Chinese revolution and cannot ignore the fine traditions of the Chinese revolution created by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Then, the author specifically discusses how this fine tradition has been inherited and carried forward in various revolutionary periods in our country. The article points out that the consistent guiding ideology embodied in Chairman Mao's works and instructions is: as long as we firmly believe that the creativity of the masses is infinite, trust the people, rely on the people, boldly mobilize the masses, and become one with the masses, then any difficulty can be overcome, and no enemy can overwhelm us, but can only be overwhelmed by us. This is the driving force for continuous Great Leap Forward, and it is also the philosophy that elucidates the laws of China's current comprehensive Great Leap Forward. The author says that the infinitely rich practice of the Chinese revolution, and Chairman Mao's philosophical works, which creatively developed Marxism-Leninism from guiding revolutionary practice, are a great development and a great leap forward in philosophy. The future of social development in our country is unlimited, and the future of philosophical development in our country is also unlimited. The leap forward of philosophy in the future will be manifested in two aspects: on the one hand, popularization, that is, the massification of philosophy. Philosophy should have originally talked about the common sense principles that the masses apply in their daily lives, but it was made mysterious by sophists. Now, this weapon should be returned to the masses. On the other hand, it is about improvement. With Chairman Mao's banner leading the way, with a large number of philosophers studying Chairman Mao's works, and in such a great era, the improvement of philosophy is an inevitable trend; the question is how to combine theory with practice and how to connect with the masses.

    跃进的哲学与哲学的跃进
    随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的大跃进，不可避免的将引起哲学的发展和提高。这是中共河南省委书记吴芝圃同志在“哲学研究”第六期发表的“跃进的哲学与哲学的跃进”一文论述的思想。作者说，我国目前已处在恩格斯早年所预言过的，人类真正从其余动物中提升出来，取得主动，变为社会和自然的主人翁的新的历史时期。但是，这样的社会并不是一下子就实现了的。人们思想的解放，人民群众的潜力的发挥，人的主观能动性的发挥，也不是一下子就做到的。为了要使生产力大跃进的客观可能性变为现实，就需要人的自觉性和主观努力的推动。因此也就需要解决人的思想问题、干劲问题，以及人应该遵循什么规律和道路去干的问题。人是大跃进的主要因素，人发挥了潜力，物才能发挥作用。因此，要研究人跃进的规律，首先要研究创造奇迹、促成大跃进的人民群众。作者进一步说，要弄清这个问题，就不能割断中国革命的历史，不能忽视党中央和毛主席所创造的中国革命的优良传统。接着，作者具体地论述了我国各个革命时期如何继承和发扬了这个优良传统。文章指出，体现在毛主席的著作和指示中的一贯的指导思想是：只要我们坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，信任人民、依靠人民、放手发动人民群众，并且同人民群众打成一片，那就任何困难都可以克服，任何敌人都不能压倒我们，而只能为我们所压倒。这就是不断大跃进的动力，也就是阐明中国目前全面大跃进的规律的哲学。作者说，无限丰富的中国革命实践，和从指导革命实践中创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的毛主席的哲学著作，是哲学的一个大发展、一个大跃进。我国社会发展的前途无限，我国哲学发展的前途也就无限。今后哲学的跃进将表现在两个方面：一方面是普及，也就是哲学的大众化。哲学本来应该讲群众家常应用的道理的，只是被玄学鬼弄玄虚了，现在应该把这武器还给大众了。另一方面是提高。有毛主席的旗帜在前面引导，有大批哲学家在钻研毛主席的著作，又是在这样一个伟大的时代里，哲学的提高是必然的趋势；问题在于如何结合实际，如何联系群众。
