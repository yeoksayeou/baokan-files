Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 6th: The International Association of Democratic Lawyers recently issued a statement in Brussels strongly protesting against the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and demanding that American troops withdraw from China's islands. The statement emphasized that these actions by the United States violate the United Nations Charter and pose a threat not only to peace in the Far East but also to world peace.

The statement expressed concern about the abnormal situation in which the United Nations, under the manipulation of the United States, has until now refused to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China. The statement emphasized that without the participation of China, a major power, fundamental international problems cannot be resolved.

    国际民主法协发表声明
    谴责美国干涉我国内政
    新华社布拉格6日电　国际民主法律工作者协会最近在布鲁塞尔发表了一项声明，强烈抗议美国干涉中国内政，要求美国军队从中国的岛屿撤退。声明强调说，美国的这些行动是违反联合国宪章的，它不仅是对远东和平的威胁，而且是对全世界和平的威胁。
    声明对于联合国在美国的操纵下直到现在仍然拒绝恢复中华人民共和国的合法地位这一不正常的现象表示不安，声明强调指出，没有中国这样一个大国参加，国际根本问题就无法解决。
