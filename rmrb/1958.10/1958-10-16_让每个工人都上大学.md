Let Every Worker Attend University
Yang Shiqun, Manager of Changchun City Gas Company

Under the leadership of the Party, Changchun City Gas Company has established a chemical engineering college. Just a few months ago, there were only a few spare-time literacy classes, but today it has a complete education network from senior primary school to university, from spare-time to part-work, part-study. Hundreds of workers, who in the past only thought about learning to read and write so they could read newspapers, now have higher goals and greater ideals: to enter and graduate from university in about five and a half to eight and a half years. This is a historically significant great leap forward in the factory.

From the perspective of developing production, we encountered countless difficulties in the past because workers lacked education and technical theory. Around 1952 to 1953, when 76% were illiterate and 20% had only primary school education, production could only make small progress, and there was no possibility of major development. After the start of the First Five-Year Plan, there were demands to increase productivity, implement technological reforms, and create new records. Thus, the contradiction of workers lacking education became even more prominent. As a result, the Party and administrative leaders of the factory began to pay attention to organizing spare-time education.

After eliminating illiteracy, it immediately became clear that the face of production and management was changing. In recent years, forty-three cadres have grown up from among the workers, and almost every aspect of production technology in the factory has undergone major reforms. Regarding the use of gas generators, the Japanese used them for five years, but we now want to use them for twenty-five years. The Japanese burned a furnace of coke in ten hours, but we do it in eight hours. Japanese refining equipment could produce 66,000 cubic meters, but we now reach 80,000 to 90,000 cubic meters. Who is relying on these achievements? Mainly workers with improved education. Recently, the higher authorities are asking us to propose a plan to expand urban gasification. If we followed the old methods, we would first ask for how many engineers, technicians, and skilled workers we need. But now? We don't plan to ask the higher authorities for them; we will train them ourselves by running schools, and we will also supply talent to the country.

After the establishment of the part-work, part-study class at the Chemical Engineering College, it was widely supported by the masses. If there are any opinions, it is that they want it to be run even better and learn even faster. The moving scene of workers living far away running to the factory around 5:30 in the morning to avoid being late for learning encourages us to run the school even better.

To run a school in a factory, as long as you break superstitions and dare to think and act, there is a way. When we started, we really didn't have a clue and didn't know where to start. At the beginning, we didn't dare to think about running a university or college; we only thought that it would be good enough to run a junior high school. We also had a set of superstitions about running a university. Later, after concrete analysis and liberating our minds, we realized from solving practical production problems that the few cadres with high school and university degrees in the past should be considered elementary school students. They had no practical experience and could not produce. For example, a comrade who completed high school chemistry did not know the softening point of tar. On the contrary, Comrade Zhang Chuanyou, who was illiterate, had more than 30 years of experience. From the perspective of practical production ability, he should be an expert above the university level. Starting from this idea, we came up with the idea of organizing a research department for veteran workers to study. Then, the senior department, intermediate department, chemical engineering department, and mechanical engineering department gradually researched a system for a chemical engineering college that was completely different from the old schools. Worker Bian Yuzhong, who became literate in 1955, reached the current high school level in chemistry after three years and can give lectures in the chemical workshop. If he studies chemistry, physics, and mathematics systematically for another three years, he can reach the level of a university graduate. After calculating it this way for specific people, we clarified the idea that it would not take more than fifteen years for an illiterate worker to graduate from university.

Regarding the issue of workers' part-work, part-study, and labor force replenishment, we solved it this way. At that time, the nearby middle schools came to our factory every day to participate in labor, so we came up with the idea of combining school part-work and factory part-study. Now, it is no longer a question of cooperation with one middle school. Northeast Normal University and Jilin University have all sent professors to our Chemical Engineering College as consultants and researchers. The concept of the so-called university in our minds is no longer a mysterious building and some unattainable things. We have the confidence to challenge and compete with regular universities to see who runs the university better and in a manner that better conforms to the spirit of the central government's instructions.

Putting politics in command is the basic guarantee for implementing the central government's instructions on education and carrying out factory-run schools. The process of our vigorously running schools is actually a process of struggle between two ideological viewpoints. When we started researching the establishment of junior high school classes, some people objected, saying, "Can we run it well? We can't even manage production well." Later, when we put up the university sign, those who opposed said, "This is simply nonsense. Watch, you will definitely collapse." When we were implementing part-work, part-study among the workers, those who opposed said, "This policy may not be correct." Some people even thought that running education in factories was an extra burden. Therefore, many leading cadres only knew how to convene meetings and never cared about studying. Even the janitors were unwilling to sweep the classrooms, and it was considered a waste to ask the finance department to buy a blackboard eraser. However, with the Party committee taking the lead personally, major problems were solved through debate and ideological work at meetings, and the backbones took the lead, gradually reversing the trend of underestimating factory-run education. Now our Party committee secretary personally serves as the president of the Chemical Engineering College and personally gives lectures. These days, the district committee secretary comes to talk about running schools, and the municipal committee secretary also comes to talk about running schools. The momentum of factory-run education is immense.

From our personal experience, we believe that the requirement put forward by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to popularize higher education in fifteen years can undoubtedly be achieved victoriously ahead of schedule in our factory.

    让每个工人都上大学
    长春市煤气公司经理　杨世群
    长春市煤气公司在党的领导之下，办起来一座化工学院。几个月前还只有几个学文化的业余班，但是今天已经有了一所从高小到大学的、从业余到半工半读的完整的教育网。几百名工人，过去想到的不过是学学文化，能看看报纸就行；今天，却有了更高的目标，更大的理想；将在五年半到八年半左右的时间内进大学和从大学毕业，这是工厂里具有历史意义的一个大跃进。
    从发展生产上看，过去由于工人没有文化，没有技术理论，遇到过无数的困难。1952年到1953年前后，76％是文盲，20％是小学文化水平的时候，生产只能有小的进步，谈不到大发展。第一个五年计划开始以后，要求提高生产力，要求技术改革，创造新纪录，于是工人没有文化的矛盾就更加突出。因此，引起了工厂党政领导对组织业余教育的重视。
    扫除了文盲以后，马上看出生产和管理的面貌在改观。这几年，从工人中生长了四十三名干部，厂内的生产技术，几乎样样发生了重大改革；从发生炉的使用，日本人使五年，我们现在要使二十五年；日本人烧一炉焦炭用十小时，我们八小时；精制设备日本人能送出六万六千立方公尺，我们现在达到八万到九万立方公尺。这些都靠谁？主要靠提高文化的工人。最近，上级正在要我们提出扩建城市煤气化的规划。如按过去的办法，我们首先提出要多少工程师、技术员、技工，现在呢？不打算向上面要，自己办学校培养，并且还要向国家输送人材。
    化工学院半工半读班办起来以后，群众普遍拥护。如果说有些意见的话，那就是要求办的再好一些，学习再快一些。早上五点半钟前后，远路的工人，为了怕学习迟到向工厂跑步的动人情景，鼓励我们更好地办学。
    在工厂办学，只要打破迷信，敢想敢干，就有办法。在开始办的时候，心里也真没有底，不知从何办起。开始没有敢想办什么大学、学院，只想到把初中办起来就差不多了，对办大学，还有一套迷信。后来经过具体分析，解放思想，从解决生产实际问题一想，认识到过去是高中、大学程度的几个干部，应该算是小学生，他们没有实际经验，不能生产。如一位学完高中化学的同志，不知道焦油的软化点。相反，一个字不识的张传有同志，他有三十多年经验，从生产实际能力来看，他应该是大学生以上的专家。就从这一个想法开始，我们想出一个组织老工人学习的研究部。接着，高级部、中级部、化工系、机械系就这样一点一点的研究出一个和旧学校完全不同的化工学院的体系。工人卞玉忠，他是1955年脱盲的，经过三年，他在化学专业上达到了现在的高中水平，可以给化工车间讲课。如再加上三年，有系统地学习化学物理和数学，他就可以达到大学毕业水平。经过这样对具体人一算，明确了一个文盲工人到大学毕业要不了十五年的思想。
    关于工人半工半读，劳动力补充的问题，我们是这样解决的。那时候，附近的中学，天天到我们厂来要参加劳动，就这样我们想出了学校半工和工厂半读相结合的办法。现在已经不是和一个中学协作的问题，东北师大、吉林大学，都派教授来给我们化工学院当顾问、作研究员，我们脑子里对于所谓大学的概念，已经不是一所神秘的大楼和一些高不可攀的事情；我们有这样的信心，要向正规大学挑战、竞赛，看谁把大学办的好，办的更符合中央指示的精神。
    政治挂帅是贯彻中央教育工作指示、开展工厂办学的基本保证。我们大办学校的过程，实际就是两种思想观点斗争的过程。开始研究办中学班，有人反对，能办好吗？生产还搞不好呢。后来挂上大学牌子，反对的人说，这简直是胡扯，看你们非垮不可。在工人中搞半工半读，反对的人说，这个方针不一定对吧。还有些人认为工厂办教育是额外的负担。因此，许多领导干部只知道召集开会，从来不管学习不学习；勤杂人员给教室扫扫地都不肯，要财会科买个黑板擦也被认为是浪费。但是，党委亲自一抓，大问题开会辩论解决思想，小问题撑腰作主，轻视工厂办教育的风气逐步扭转过来。现在我们的党委书记亲自作化工学院院长，亲自讲课；这些天，区委书记来谈办学，市委书记也来谈办学，工厂办教育的声势浩大。
    从我们切身的体会，我们相信，中共中央和国务院提出在十五年普及高等教育的要求，在我们工厂毫无疑问，可以提前胜利地实现。
