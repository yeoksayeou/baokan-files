    On the afternoon of October 8th, over 500 people from all walks of life in Wanxian City, Sichuan Province, accompanied Tamara Alekseyevna Kulishenko, the wife of Soviet Volunteer Air Force squadron leader Kulishenko, who sacrificed himself here to help China resist Japan, and her daughter, Ina Kulishenko, in a solemn ceremony at the martyr's tomb. Kulishenko's wife and daughter had made a special trip from the Soviet Union to pay their respects to their loved one. They presented wreaths to their loved one, whom they had been separated from for nineteen years. Then, the people who came to pay their respects presented hundreds of wreaths and flowers at the tomb. Guo Hua, the mayor of Wanxian City, said in his speech that we will never forget Comrade Kulishenko, a true friend of the Chinese people and a great internationalist fighter. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is forged with blood, as deep as the sea and as solid as a rock...

    The heroic deeds of the internationalist fighter Kulishenko are still talked about by the people of Wanxian as if they happened yesterday. In the summer of 1939, when the Japanese invaders were frantically bombing major cities in China and the Americans were selling large quantities of gasoline and scrap iron to Japan, the Soviet people sent two volunteer air force squadrons to help us. Kulishenko was the commander of one of these squadrons. After arriving in China, he helped us train pilots and fought against the Japanese aerial bandits, rendering great service to the Chinese people in the first few months. On October 14th of the same year, Kulishenko led his squadron to bomb Wuhan, a military stronghold occupied by the Japanese invaders. In the fierce air battle, Kulishenko shot down six enemy planes, achieving brilliant results. However, the lead plane he was piloting was damaged under concentrated enemy fire. The heroic Kulishenko flew the damaged plane out of the encirclement and flew back to the rear base along the Yangtze River. When flying over Wanxian, the fuselage lost its balance and could not continue. According to the personnel who escaped with him, it would have been quite safe to abandon the plane and parachute. However, in order to preserve this aircraft, which could still fight after being repaired, Kulishenko risked his life and landed the plane on the river more than ten miles east of the city. All the other personnel on board jumped into the water and swam to the shore, but Kulishenko, who had been working day and night for several months and was exhausted in the air battle, was unable to swim ashore and thus contributed his precious life to the Chinese people.

    Before liberation, people only knew a little about the life of this internationalist fighter. It was not until after liberation, through the introduction of people who had worked with him and the narration of his family members this time, that more was known. Kulishenko was born in 1903 in a poor peasant family in the Kherson district near Kiev, Ukraine. He lost his parents at a very young age and had to make a living on his own. After the victory of the revolution, he went to work in a factory, joined the Communist Youth League, and soon joined the Communist Party. Later, he joined the Red Army, entered aviation school, and served in the Air Force after graduation. He had unparalleled hatred for the imperialist aggressors and deep sympathy for the Chinese people. From the first day he arrived in our country in June 1939, he plunged into intense work. After more than a month of continuous night flight training, he became thinner and his eye sockets were slightly sunken. His translator advised him to take a good rest after finishing the night flight, but he refused. He said, "To be honest, I experience the suffering of the Chinese people as if I were experiencing the disaster of my motherland. Every time I see buildings destroyed by Japanese planes and fleeing crowds, I feel sad. We must make the enemy pay double the price."

    Kulishenko's body was recovered from the river by the people of Wanxian, who had suffered from imperialist bullying, and buried under Taibaiyan Mountain. Despite the Kuomintang reactionaries' deliberate attempts to cover it up, Kulishenko's heroic deeds were quickly spread. Even under the white terror rule before liberation, people constantly went to his tomb to pay their respects. After liberation, Kulishenko's deeds were more widely publicized. People published them in newspapers and periodicals, included them in textbooks, and drew them into picture books. Not only the people of Wanxian, but all the Chinese people know his famous name and take him as an example to learn from. Wanxian No. 1 Junior High School named the best Young Pioneer team in the school "Kulishenko Team." When this team graduated, they handed over the souvenirs presented by the school to the team at school to continue passing on. In the upsurge of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, many young people signed up to join the Volunteer Army, walked to Kulishenko's tomb, and pledged to aid the Korean people as Kulishenko aided the Chinese people. This year, people from all walks of life in Wanxian City used voluntary labor to build a new mausoleum for Kulishenko in the beautiful Xishan Park in the city. Liu Haitian, an 89-year-old retired worker, volunteered to guard the mausoleum for life. This white-haired old man personally buried Comrade Kulishenko nineteen years ago, and he came to carry the coffin again when the remains were reburied in July this year. He said that he would personally participate in handling everything related to Kulishenko.

    Several months ago, the people of Wanxian City wrote to Kulishenko's wife and daughter, telling them about the annual commemoration of Kulishenko here. The people of the city all hoped that they would have the opportunity to visit Wanxian. This time they came to Wanxian, and people expressed their greatest concern and love to them as if they were receiving relatives. The handicraft workers of the bamboo and woodware production cooperative also carefully made an exquisite small boat and gave it to them, using it to symbolize the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union crossing the river in the same boat, riding the wind and waves, and working together towards communism.

    库里申科活在中国人民的心里
    新华社记者  刘宗棠　徐宜道
    10月8日下午，四川省万县市各界人民五百多人，陪同为帮助我国抗战而在这里牺牲的苏联志愿空军大队长库里申科的妻子塔玛拉·阿克列谢耶夫娜·库里申科和女儿伊娜·库里申科，在烈士墓前举行了隆重的扫墓仪式。库里申科的妻子和女儿是特地从苏联赶来祭奠她们的亲人的。她们向阔别十九年的亲人敬献花圈。接着，同来祭奠的人们把几百个花圈和鲜花献在墓前。万县市市长郭华在讲话中说，我们永远也不会忘记中国人民的生死朋友，伟大的国际主义战士库里申科同志。中苏两国人民友谊是用鲜血凝结成的，深如大海，固如磐石……
    国际主义战士库里申科的英雄事迹，万县的人民至今谈起来还像是昨天才发生的事。1939年夏天，正当日寇疯狂轰炸中国各大城市，美国人把大量汽油和废铁卖给日本的时候，苏联人民派遣了两个志愿空军大队来帮助我们，库里申科便是其中一个大队的大队长。他来到中国以后，一面帮助我们训练飞行员，一面打击日本空中强盗，在最初的几个月里就为中国人民立下了许多功劳。同年10月14日，库里申科率领他的大队轰炸日寇盘踞的军事据点武汉，在激烈的空战中，库里申科击落了敌机六架，取得了辉煌的战果。但是，他驾驶的领航机在敌人集中攻击下受了伤。英勇的库里申科驾着受伤的飞机冲出包围，沿着长江飞回后方基地。当飞临万县上空时，机身失去平衡，不能继续前进。据脱险归来的和他同机的人员谈，当时如舍弃飞机不顾，跳伞降落，是相当安全的。但库里申科为了保全这架经过修理还能作战的飞机，他冒着极大的危险，把飞机降落到城东面十多里处的江面上。机上其他人员都奋身跳水游到岸上，但几个月来昼夜操劳、又在空战中过度疲劳的库里申科再也无力游上岸来，就这样为中国人民贡献了他的宝贵生命。
    解放前，人们对这位国际主义战士的生平只知道一鳞半爪，直到解放后，经过去曾和他一起工作过的人的介绍，和这次他的家属的叙述，才知道了更多的情况。库里申科是1903年出生在乌克兰基辅附近考尔松区一个贫苦的农民家里，很小就失去了父母，不得不自己谋生。革命胜利后，他到工厂做工，参加了共青团，不久又参加了共产党。随后他参加了红军，考入航空学校，毕业后就在空军服务。他对帝国主义侵略者有着无比的仇恨，对中国人民怀有深厚的同情。从1939年6月他到我国第一天起，就投入了紧张的工作。在连续一个多月的夜间航行教练后，他消瘦了，眼窝也微陷了，他的翻译员劝他在结束了夜间飞行以后好好休息一下，但他不肯，他说：“说实话，我像体验着祖国的灾难一样，体验着中国人民正在遭受的灾难，每当我看到被日本飞机炸毁的建筑物和逃难的人群就难过，我们一定要敌人付出加倍的代价。”
    库里申科的遗体，是曾经饱受帝国主义欺侮的万县人民从江中打捞起来的，埋葬在太白岩山下。尽管国民党反动派有意蒙蔽，库里申科的英勇事迹还是很快地被传颂出去。就是在解放前的白色恐怖统治下，人们还是不断地到他的墓前凭吊。解放后，库里申科的事迹更加广泛地宣扬开来，人们把它刊登在报刊上，编入教科书中，绘成连环图画。不仅万县人民，全中国人民都知道他的英名，并把他当成学习的榜样。万县市第一初级中学把全校最优秀的少先队命名为“库里申科队”，这个队毕业时，又把学校赠的纪念品，交给在校的队继续传下去。在抗美援朝的怒潮中，许多青年人报名参加志愿军时，走到库里申科的墓地前，保证要像库里申科援助中国人民那样去援助朝鲜人民。今年，万县市各界人民用义务劳动在市内幽美的西山公园，为库里申科另建了一座新的陵墓，一个已退休的八十九岁的老工人刘海田，自愿终身看守陵墓。就是这位白发苍苍的老人，十九年前曾亲手埋葬了库里申科同志，今年7月间灵柩迁葬时，他又赶来抬棺。他说，凡是库里申科的事情，他都要亲自参加料理。
    早在几个月前，万县市人民就写信给库里申科的妻子和女儿，把这里每年纪念库里申科的情况告诉她们。全市人民都希望她们有机会能到万县来作客。这次她们来到万县，人们都像接待亲人一样向她们表示最大的关怀和热爱。竹木器生产合作社的手工业工人们还精心赶制了一只精致的小船送给她们，用它来象征中苏两大民族同舟共济，乘风破浪，携手迈向共产主义。
