Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, Washington dispatch: After U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reported to Eisenhower at the White House on the U.S.-Chiang talks on the 24th, he issued a statement.

In his statement, Dulles once again admitted that China's resumption of shelling of Jinmen disrupted his plan to go to Taipei for "consultations" to achieve a "long-term ceasefire." He also wantonly interfered in this purely internal Chinese affair, smearing that China "hopes to obstruct the achievement of stable tranquility," and that the Chinese "Communists seem to believe that if they allow chaotic and uncertain situations to persist for a long time," they "will be best able to achieve domination over the Western Pacific." Dulles' remarks are obviously unable to cover up the "long-term ceasefire" conspiracy that the United States has been playing with, the purpose of which is to prolong and legitimize the U.S. armed invasion of Chinese territory and the resulting tensions in the Far East.

Dulles also described "Chinese Communism" as "a deadly danger" in the Far East. One reason he gave was that "they are stepping up propaganda saying that everything will be fine if the Asian people unite to drive the United States out of the Western Pacific."

When talking about the U.S.-Chiang talks, Dulles blatantly revealed the U.S. plot to promote "two Chinas" and from "two Chinas" to establish a "one China" still ruled by the United States. Dulles openly said in the tone of a manipulator of the Chiang Kai-shek clique that he "returned from the Taipei talks deeply convinced that the government of Free China (i.e., the Chiang Kai-shek clique) is prudent," "not using force," but "committed to using peaceful methods to realize its aspirations and traditions as a spokesperson for China." At the same time, Dulles said that the "mission of the government of Free China" is to "restore freedom to the people on the mainland." From these words of Dulles, it can be seen that the current conspiracy of the United States is to create "two Chinas," but its ultimate goal is to subvert the People's Republic of China.

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, Washington dispatch: On the same day that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles concluded his talks with Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei, the U.S. Information Service broadcast from Washington a record of Dulles' conversation with William Clark, a reporter for British Independent Television, on October 16th. In this conversation, which Dulles made several days before holding talks with Chiang Kai-shek, he once again revealed the United States' long-planned conspiracy to create two Chinas and expressed his intention to do his best to promote this conspiracy.

Clark pointed out to Dulles that many people in the United Kingdom criticize the United States' China policy, believing that the U.S. policy of not recognizing China is unrealistic.

In answering this question, Dulles said that the United States in fact recognizes China's existence, but it will not recognize China diplomatically. Dulles said that the United States "undoubtedly recognizes that Communist China is a fact, because we deal with Communist China. Indeed, I think that in the past ten years, the United States has dealt with Communist China more constantly and seriously than any other free world country (referring to Western countries). We have dealt with it on the Korean armistice issue. We, and you, as well as France and other countries, have dealt with it on the Geneva Indochina armistice issue. We have been talking with the Chinese Communists at the level of diplomatic personnel for the past four years, first in Geneva and now in Warsaw. This is a fact, we treat it as a fact, and whenever it is beneficial to the world or beneficial to peace to deal with it, we will not hesitate to deal with it."

As for diplomatic recognition, Dulles said that the United States now "sees no particular reason" why it should diplomatically recognize China.

Dulles then talked about the U.S. attitude towards the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique. He said that the United States supports the Chiang Kai-shek clique, "it is the recognized government of China," the United States recognized it before 1945, and continues to recognize it now.

This blatantly lays out the U.S. conspiracy to be hostile to the Chinese people and insist on creating "two Chinas."

Dulles further compared China's situation with the current situations of divided Korea, Vietnam, and Germany, which further illustrates the U.S. conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Dulles also said in the tone of a naked aggressor that the entire "position of the United States in the Western Pacific" depends on maintaining a so-called "persistent line" from Japan to New Zealand, including Taiwan. He said that the United States must "persist," and if there is a gap in this "defense line," the entire line will be affected.

    杜勒斯和盘托出侵略我国二部曲
    先制造两个中国然后建立美国统治的一个中国
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯24日到白宫向艾森豪威尔报告美蒋会谈情况以后，发表了一项声明。
    杜勒斯在声明里再一次承认，我国恢复炮击金门，打乱了他这次去台北“磋商”实现“长期停火”阴谋的计划。他又对恢复炮击这种纯属中国内部的事务妄加干预，诬蔑说中国“希望阻挠实现稳定的平静”，中国“共产党人似乎认为，如果他们使混乱和不定的情况长期存在下去”，“就能够最好地实现对西太平洋的统治”。杜勒斯这样讲当然是掩盖不了美国一直在玩弄着的“长期停火”的阴谋的，这个阴谋的目的在于使美国武装侵略中国领土以及由此而产生的远东紧张局势长期化和合法化。
    杜勒斯还把“中国共产主义”说成是远东的“一个致命的危险”。他提出的一个理由是，“他们加紧进行宣传说，如果亚洲人民团结起来把美国从西太平洋赶出去，那么就会万事大吉”。
    杜勒斯在谈到美蒋会谈时，露骨地表明美国要推行“两个中国”，并且从“两个中国”进而到建立仍然由美国统治的“一个中国”的阴谋。杜勒斯公开以蒋介石集团摆布者的口吻说，他从台北会谈“回来时深信，自由中国政府（即蒋介石集团）是谨慎的”，“不是使用武力”，而“致力于用和平方法实现它作为中国的愿望和传统的代言人”。杜勒斯同时说，“自由中国政府”的“使命是使大陆上的人民重新获得自由”。从杜勒斯这些话里可以看到，美国目前的阴谋是制造“两个中国”，但它的最终目标是颠复中华人民共和国。
    新华社25日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国国务卿杜勒斯在台北结束同蒋介石会谈的同一天，美国新闻处从华盛顿播发了杜勒斯在10月16日同英国独立电视公司记者威廉·克拉克的一篇谈话记录。杜勒斯在这篇同蒋介石进行会谈前好几天发表的谈话里，再一次透露了美国蓄谋已久的制造两个中国的阴谋，并且表示要竭力推行这个阴谋。
    克拉克向杜勒斯指出，在英国有很多人批评美国的对华政策，认为美国不承认中国的政策是不现实的。
    杜勒斯在回答这个问题时表示，美国在事实上承认中国是存在的，但是它将不在外交上承认中国。杜勒斯说，美国“无疑承认共产党中国是一个事实，因为我们同共产党中国打交道。的确，我觉得过去十年来，美国比任何其他自由世界国家（指西方国家）更加不断地、认真地同共产党中国打交道。我们曾经在朝鲜停战问题上同它打交道。我们，还有你们，以及法国和其他国家，曾经在日内瓦印度支那停战问题上同它打交道。我们在过去四年当中一直在外交人员一级同中国共产党人会谈，起先在日内瓦，现在在华沙。这是一个事实，我们把它当作一个事实同它打交道，无论什么时候，只要同它办交涉有利于世界或有利于和平，我们就毫不迟疑地同它办交涉。”
    至于外交上的承认，杜勒斯说，美国现在“看不到有什么特别的理由”，应该在外交上承认中国。
    杜勒斯接着谈到美国对待台湾蒋介石集团的态度。他说，美国是支持蒋介石集团的，“它是公认的中国政府”，美国在1945年以前承认它，现在继续承认它。
    这就露骨地摊开了美国敌视中国人民、执意制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    杜勒斯还进一步把中国的情况同目前处在分裂状态的朝鲜、越南、德国的情况相提并论，这进一步说明了美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    杜勒斯还以赤裸裸的侵略者的口吻说，美国“在西太平洋的整个阵地”取决于保持一条包括台湾在内的从日本到新西兰的所谓“坚持的阵线”。他说，美国必须“坚持下去”，如果在这条“防线”上出现缺口，全线都将受到影响。
