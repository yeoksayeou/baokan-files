Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The national representative conference on opening Japan-China relations and preventing the nuclear armament of Japan, jointly hosted by the Japan National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, was held in Tokyo today. More than one hundred representatives from all over Japan attended the meeting.

    After analyzing the current international and domestic situation, the meeting unanimously adopted an action plan.

    The plan pointed out that the movement to open Japan-China relations must be combined with the struggle against the nuclear armament of Japan and other struggles to uphold peace and strive for independence, so as to form a massive movement to urge the Nobusuke Kishi government to fundamentally change its current policies.

    The plan pointed out that the movement must pay attention to the issue of the United States carrying out armed provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait area, because this is an issue closely related to Japan's security and also related to Asian peace. We must force the Nobusuke Kishi government to change its policies on the Taiwan issue.

    The plan stipulated that a movement against the Nobusuke Kishi government's revision of the "Police Officer Duty Execution Law" must be launched simultaneously, and support the struggle of Nagasaki shipyard workers to refuse to produce "Oerlikon" missiles, so that this struggle will develop into a nationwide struggle.

    The plan stipulated that in the movement, it is necessary to actively seek further unity among democratic parties, trade unions, democratic groups, and farmers' groups, give play to creativity, and launch various forms of movement in cities and villages. Before the end of the year, efforts should be made to hold mass rallies in all prefectures, prefectural districts, and special wards to open Japan-China relations and prevent the nuclear armament of Japan, and to establish lower-level organizations of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations.

    Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, emphasized in his speech that the issue of opening Japan-China relations and preventing the nuclear armament of Japan is not only an issue between Japan and China, but also an issue of Japan's own security and world peace, and the Japanese people must treat this issue with a new awareness.

    Nakajima pointed out that if the Nobusuke Kishi government's conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is realized, Japan will form a "community of common destiny" with the United States and involve Japan in the U.S. encirclement of China and the Soviet Union, becoming one of its links. He pointed out that if the Nobusuke Kishi government's "Anti-Espionage Law" and "Police Officer Duty Execution Law Amendment" and other bills are established, Japan will return to the dark era before the war.

    Nakajima called on all democratic parties, workers, farmers, and democratic groups to resolutely unite and do their best to crush these conspiracies of the Nobusuke Kishi government and to fight to the end to open the deadlock in Japan-China relations and prevent the nuclear armament of Japan.

    Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Tadao Sata, International Minister of the Socialist Party, and representatives from various regions also spoke at the meeting.

    日本打开日中关系大会通过运动方针
    开展强大运动迫使岸政府改变政策
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：由日本恢复日中邦交国民会议和禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会联合主持的打开日中关系和阻止核武装日本全国代表会议今天在东京举行。参加会议的有来自日本各地的一百多名代表。
    会议分析了当前国际国内形势之后，一致通过了运动方针。
    方针指出，打开日中关系的运动必须同反对核武装日本等拥护和平和争取独立的斗争相结合，以便汇成声势浩大的运动，促使岸信介政府根本改变现行政策。
    方针指出，运动必须重视美国在台湾海峡地区对中国进行武装挑衅的问题，因为这是同日本的安全有密切关系的问题，同时也是同亚洲和平有关的问题。我们要在台湾问题上迫使岸信介政府改变政策。
    方针规定，必须同时展开反对岸信介政府修改“警察官职务执行法”的运动，并且支持长崎造船工人拒绝生产“厄利康”型导弹的斗争，使这种斗争发展成为全民性斗争。
    方针规定，在运动中必须积极谋求民主党派、工会、民主团体、农民团体的进一步团结，发挥创造性，在各城市和乡村展开各式各样的运动。在年底以前，努力在所有的都、道、府、县举行打开日中关系和阻止核武装日本的群众大会，并且成立恢复日中邦交国民会议的下级机构。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏在发言中强调指出，打开日中关系和阻止核武装日本的问题不独是日中两国间的问题，而是日本自己的安全和全世界和平的问题，日本人民必须以新的觉悟来对待这个问题。
    中岛指出，岸信介政府修改日美“安全条约”的阴谋如果实现，日本将同美国成立“同一命运的共同体”，并且把日本卷进美国对中苏的包围网，成为其中一个环节。他指出，岸信介政府的“防谍法”和“警察官职务执行法修正案”等法案如果成立，将使日本恢复到战前的黑暗时代。
    中岛要求各民主党派、工人、农民和民主团体坚决团结起来，尽全力为粉碎岸信介政府的这些阴谋和为打开日中僵局、阻止日本的核武装而斗争到底。
    在会上发言的还有日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁、社会党国际部长佐多忠隆和各地代表。
