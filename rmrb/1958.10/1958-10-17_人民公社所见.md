What I Saw at the People's Commune
Li Xiannian

On September 11, we departed from Beijing and visited Xushui, Baoding, and Anguo in Hebei Province, and Xinxiang in Henan Province. On the 17th, we arrived in Zhengzhou. Along the way, we listened to reports from local Party committees and visited some people's communes, observing, asking questions, and discussing matters. Everywhere we went, cotton, sweet potatoes, and autumn grains were growing very well. After the establishment of the communes, the masses were in high spirits, and everyone, young and old, male and female, was joyful and full of confidence. From their sincerity and enthusiasm, one could see their boundless trust and love for the Party and Chairman Mao. Now, I would like to talk about what we have seen and the issues we have encountered.

(1) These places have already been collectivized into people's communes. People's communes generally take two forms: one is one commune per county, with the county and commune merged; the other is several communes per county, with the county establishing a federation of communes. One commune per county means that there is one commune in the entire county, with unified revenue and expenditure, unified accounting, and shared profits and losses. The income of the original communes and teams is handed over to the county, and expenditures are uniformly approved and distributed by the county. The supply standards and wage levels are basically the same throughout the county. Xushui County and Xiuwu County are like this. Several communes per county means that each primary-level commune does its own accounting and is responsible for its own profits and losses. The county federation of communes can extract a certain amount of accumulation from each commune for construction within the county. Anguo County and Xinxiang County are like this. The one-commune-per-county form is, to a great extent, a system of ownership by the whole people. We will all take this path in the future. However, I think that the practice of one commune per county may currently have two problems, and how to handle them needs to be carefully considered: one is how to ensure that the initiative of the lower-level communes and teams is not hindered after the county implements unified accounting. The other is how to reasonably take into account the differences in the original economic conditions and living standards of the various communes and teams when arranging wages. If we simply cut the high and raise the low, it will lower the living standards of some people. If everyone looks to the higher standards, it will affect the accumulation of the commune. In my opinion, the form of county federation of communes can, to some extent, regulate the accumulation of various communes, and can also, to some extent, avoid the troubles that one commune per county may cause. The transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people requires a process. Under the current circumstances, the widespread establishment of county federations of communes may be more appropriate. As the Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas states: "Do not rush to change collective ownership to ownership by the whole people; it is better to adopt collective ownership at present." Of course, the form of one commune per county is a creative experiment and can be continued on a trial basis in order to gain experience.

(2) People's communes have mostly implemented a half-supply, half-wage distribution system, which is an inevitable product of the development of people's communes. The supply portion is the part of the basic living necessities of the commune members, and the wage portion is the part of the commune members' other expenses and living expenses. The former is the part distributed according to needs (distributed equally per person) based on current production conditions, and the latter is the part paid according to labor. In the several communes we saw, the supply portion included "seven guarantees" (guaranteed food, clothing, medical care, childbirth, education, housing, and funerals) in some places, and "five guarantees" or "six guarantees" in others, depending on the economic situation of the commune. Some only guaranteed food and grain, while the wage portion ranged from four to fifteen yuan per month for different grades, and some were only two or three yuan. Additional bonus wages were given to those who worked well. Taking the Qiliying People's Commune in Xinxiang as an example, the ratio of the supply portion to the wage portion was roughly 50 yuan per person per year for the supply portion and 50 yuan for the wage portion (including bonus wages), with the supply portion and the wage portion each accounting for half. In other communes, the supply portion was larger in some, and the wage portion was larger in others. Because the people's communes have just been established and the economic conditions vary from place to place, it is impossible for the scope of the guarantees to be uniform, and the wages cannot be consistent. However, in any case, eating without money and receiving wages monthly are groundbreaking events for the peasants. In the past few years, grain was relatively tight, but now the grain problem has been solved. In many public canteens, it was like this: people ate a lot on the first day, exceeding the ration; they slightly exceeded it on the second day; and on the third day, they returned to the original supply figure, or close to the original supply figure. With this, a weight was lifted, the peasants were satisfied, and the cadres were relieved. At the Beidaihe Conference, some comrades proposed "eating without money." Now it seems that it is not difficult to fully implement this method. I think the same is true for other necessities. As one product becomes abundant, the supply system is implemented for that product, the portion distributed according to needs and the portion supplied quantitatively are gradually expanded, and the portion paid according to labor is gradually reduced. In this way, we gradually transition to communism. As for the fact that wages are paid monthly in addition to eating, the peasants are even more satisfied. Some communes held grand ceremonies on the first day of paying wages, with men, women, old and young all attending the meeting. After receiving their wages, some peasants were so moved that they shed tears. Eating without money and receiving wages monthly is an event of world significance. Since Marx put forward the great ideal of communism, opponents have used the excuse that the implementation of the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" would produce lazy people. This is not the case. With the implementation of a distribution system of partial supply plus basic wages plus bonus wages, people no longer worry about food and clothing. Now they are considering how to work better in order to be worthy of the new society and worthy of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. People have not become lazy; instead, they have become more diligent and energetic. It seems that the gradual implementation of the communist economic system and the raising of people's communist consciousness and moral qualities are mutually promoting. Here, everyone raises the following questions: What should be done about state personnel in rural areas after the peasants implement the half-supply, half-wage distribution system? What should be done in cities after the half-supply, half-wage distribution system is implemented in rural areas? What should be done about workers and state personnel? It seems that the situation is pressing, and this issue must be considered in a timely manner.

(3) The establishment of people's communes is another major historical change in our country's society, and it will inevitably lead to a series of profound changes in production, distribution, exchange, and consumption. Based on what we have seen in Hebei and Henan, these changes mainly include the following points:

First, it eliminated some of the last remnants of private ownership of the means of production and further liberated the productive forces. Some well-to-do middle peasants said, "This time, even the roots have been dug up." Small merchants and peddlers have disappeared in many places. There are no small merchants or peddlers in the entire Xushui County. Many communes are large communes with tens of thousands of people and tens of thousands of households. With a large population, wide scope, and great strength, labor, materials, and financial resources can be more rationally deployed and used. Things that small communes could not do in the past can now be done quickly. Women have been liberated from housework and have become a vital force in the commune. Although the communes have only been established for a short time, people have already seen their advantages and the beautiful prospects of communism. The masses have more confidence and greater enthusiasm.

Second, the portion of products directly distributed has expanded, and the proportion of commodity exchange has shrunk. In the past, many products were circulated as commodities between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, between agricultural cooperatives, and between peasants. Now, they have become self-produced and self-used and are directly distributed within the commune. That is to say, things that were produced for sale in the past are now produced for one's own needs; some things that needed to be purchased from the market in the past can now be produced and supplied by oneself. The current situation is this: the commune uses scrap steel to process and manufacture ball bearings, which are directly distributed to various production teams for installation on vehicles, without going through buying and selling. As for the portion of commodity exchange, some changes have also taken place under the new circumstances. Many commodities that were purchased and sold piecemeal by individual households in the past are now purchased and sold collectively by the commune and team as a unit. Now, public canteens buy oil in large baskets and salt in large packages, and one no longer sees individual households queuing up with oil bottles or buying salt in small packages. Due to the militarization of organization, the combatization of action, and the collectivization of life, the demand for commodities has changed. Certain commodities suitable for individual life, such as small pots and small ladles, have no sales or sales have dropped sharply, while, conversely, the sales of commodities suitable for collective life have greatly increased.

Third, the distribution system has changed, and communist elements have grown. As mentioned earlier, many communes have changed from the past method of evaluating work and recording points, pre-distribution in summer and autumn, and final settlement at the end of the year, to a method of partial supply and basic wages plus bonus wages. And wages are paid to individual laborers, no longer uniformly paid to the head of the household, breaking through the old patriarchal system. This is a good thing. The relationships between people are changing, and people's ideology and mental outlook are also changing.

Fourth, collective welfare undertakings in the communes have generally developed. The people's communes we have seen have generally established public canteens, sewing groups, nurseries, kindergartens, homes for the elderly, hospitals, and maternity hospitals. Many things that were done by the state in the past, such as hospitals and schools, are now run by the communes themselves. Many commune members are now uniformly responsible for everything from eating, clothing, raising children to medical care by the commune, realizing the socialization of housework. Women are particularly enthusiastic about public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens. They say that these organizations "cannot be dismantled or driven away."

(4) The collectivization of people's communes is a major reorganization of the social economy. It is changing the old connections in production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, and establishing new connections. These changes are reflected in financial work in that the original industrial and commercial tax system, which took commodity circulation as the tax collection link, is basically no longer applicable. These changes are reflected in the work of banks in that the pattern of seasonal cash input and seasonal cash withdrawal in rural areas has changed, cash transactions have been further reduced, and the scope of transfer settlement has been expanded. These changes are reflected in the work of commerce and grain in that procurement and supply are more concentrated, planning and organization are more strengthened, and the methods of operation and the types of products have also changed. The task of unified grain sales in rural areas is basically gone. A common problem is that the township and commune have been merged, and the people's commune is both an economic organization and a political power organization. The country's township and town financial work must be merged with the commune's own financial work. Rural banking institutions will further become the settlement center for various economic activities of the commune. Commercial work has become an inseparable part of the commune's own economic life. Under these circumstances, how to adapt rural financial and trade work in terms of institutional setting, business management, and how to handle related systems and working relationships, etc., also urgently need to be considered and resolved.

In order to solve the problem of how financial and trade work should adapt to the needs of the collectivization of people's communes, we proposed the principle of "two releases, three unifications, and one contract" in Beijing, based on the principle of centralized leadership and decentralized management. The so-called two releases are to release the personnel and assets of the financial and trade departments in rural areas to the people's commune, which is responsible for management and operation (not only financial and trade personnel, but also state cadres in rural areas, including township cadres, primary school teachers, and personnel from various institutions, it seems that they should also be released to the people's commune). The so-called three unifications are to unify policies, unify plans, and unify the management of working capital. The people's commune must implement the state's market price policy, the policy of unified purchase and unified sale, and other policies and relevant regulations; the people's commune must, in accordance with the state plan, hand over products for unified purchase and unified acquisition and allocate unified sales materials to commune members; the working capital transferred by the state to the commune can only be used for working capital needed for industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation, and must not be used for capital construction and other purposes. The so-called one contract is to contract financial tasks, uniformly calculate the state's various financial revenues in rural areas, deduct administrative expenses and various institutional expenses originally paid by the state, and hand over the balance of revenue and expenditure to the commune on a contract basis. We solicited the opinions of local Party committees and commune cadres on this principle of two releases, three unifications, and one contract in the places we visited this time. They all agreed, but there were different plans on the specific methods of contracting. For example, some places are willing to contract according to a certain percentage; some places are willing to contract according to a certain amount. I think that the situations in various places are not exactly the same. Under the principle of the commune uniformly contracting and handing over, the methods of contracting can vary from place to place and do not need to be forced to be consistent. The specific timing and steps of implementation can also be determined by oneself according to local conditions.

(5) Some cadres of financial and trade departments above the county level are concerned that the implementation of the principle of two releases, three unifications, and one contract, releasing state institutions to the people's commune, is a step backward from ownership by the whole people to collective ownership; some comrades are concerned that this will affect the state's income; and some comrades are also concerned that with the decentralization of powers, there will be nothing to do. We say that the people's commune is a combination of a grassroots economic organization and a grassroots political power organization. After the financial and trade institutions are released, these institutions are both a component of the commune and a grassroots unit of the financial and trade departments. For example, the commune's financial department is both the commune's financial agency and the state's grassroots financial institution; the commune's supply and marketing cooperative is both the commune's commodity distribution agency and the state-owned commerce's grassroots institution. The release of financial and trade institutions actually increases the ownership by the whole people component of the commune and strengthens the state's leadership over the people's commune, making it easier for the commune to further transition to ownership by the whole people in the future. I don't think this is a step backward, but a step forward. The release of financial and trade institutions certainly returns a portion of the state's property and income to the commune, but in the end, the commune still has to hand over a certain amount of income to the state through financial channels, and the state's income will not be reduced. As for the question of whether the financial and trade departments have nothing to do, it should be recognized that in the future, the financial and trade departments will still maintain a business leadership relationship with the financial and trade institutions of the commune. The state financial and trade departments should regard the financial and trade work of the commune as their own work and regard helping the commune do a good job in financial and trade aspects as their important task. Now that the commune has only been established for a short time, and various tasks are still being established, how the commune should keep accounts, how to calculate, how to strengthen management, and strengthen planning, etc., all need help. How can we say that there is nothing to do! Comrade Wu Zhipu said: "The foundation of financial and trade work is in the commune," which is very correct. Take planning and management, for example, the current problem is very prominent. For example, chickens and eggs, because the commune members' private plots are gone, they don't cook at home, and they don't have the time, so they must be included in the overall plan as soon as possible and find ways to raise them. The commune is a five-in-one entity of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are comprehensively developed. It itself requires a high degree of planning. If something is not included in the plan, it is in danger of being squeezed out. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the contract system, that is, what the commune sells to the state and what the state supplies to the commune, should be stipulated in advance by contract. Connecting the state plan with the commune plan through contracts seems to be the main form of commercial combination between the state and the commune for a long time to come.

The above letter was written in Zhengzhou. On September 20, we left Zhengzhou, detoured through Nanyang and Xiangfan, arrived in Wuhan on the 27th, and returned to Beijing on the 30th. Judging from the situation in Hubei, they are taking more cautious steps there. They first built the framework of the people's commune, and the lower levels have not yet moved temporarily, and they have not implemented the method of eating grain without money. They advocate that wholesale commerce should not be turned over to the people's commune. I think this can also be done. The situations in various places are different, and specific practices do not need to be forced to be consistent.

    人民公社所见
    李先念
    9月11日我们从北京动身，先后到河北省的徐水、保定、安国和河南省的新乡，17日到郑州，沿途听了地方党委的汇报，访问了一些人民公社，边看、边问、边谈。所到之处，棉花、红薯和秋粮都长得非常好。公社建立以后，群众情绪很高，无论男女老少，都兴高采烈，充满了自信。从他们的诚恳热情，可以看出他们对党和毛主席的无限信任和热爱。现在谈一点我们看到的情况和接触到的问题。
    （一）这些地方已经人民公社化了。人民公社大体上有两种形式：一种是一县一社，县、社合一；一种是一县数社，县成立联社。一县一社即是一县一个公社，全县统收统支，统一核算，共负盈亏，原来各社、队的收入统一交县，支出统一由县核发，供给标准、工资水平全县基本上一致。徐水县和修武县就是这样。一县数社即是各基层社单独核算，自负盈亏，县联社可以向各公社提取一定的积累，用于县范围的建设。安国县和新乡县就是这样。一县一社的形式在很大程度上是全民所有制，将来都要走这条路，但是我想，一县一社的作法在目前可能有这样两个问题，如何处理需要很好地斟酌：一个是全县实行统一核算以后，怎样做到不妨碍下面社、队的经营积极性。一个是在安排工资的时候，怎样做到合理照顾原来各社、队的经济条件和生活水平的差别。如果只是削高就低，就会降低一部分人的生活水平；如果大家都向高的看齐，又会影响社的积累，在我看来，县联社的形式，目前可以在一定程度上调节各个公社的积累，又可以在一定程度上避免上述一县一社可能引起的麻烦。由集体所有制转为全民所有制是需要一个过程的，在目前情况下，普遍地建立县联社的作法，可能比较更适宜一些。正如中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议中所说：“不要忙于改集体所有制为全民所有制，在目前还是以采用集体所有制为好”。当然，一县一社的形式是一个创造性的试验，也可以试办下去，以便吸取经验。
    （二）人民公社大都实行了半供给半工资的分配制度，这是人民公社化发展的一种必然产物。供给部分是社员基本生活必需的部分，工资部分是社员其他开支和生活零用的部分。前一部分是根据当前生产条件按需要分配（按人平均分配）的部分，后一部分是按劳取酬的部分。我们看到的几个公社，供给部分有的实行“七包”（包吃饭，包穿衣，包医疗，包生育，包教育，包居住，包婚丧），有的根据社的经济情况，实行“五包”、“六包”，有的只包吃饭、包粮食，工资部分有的按不同等级每月四元至十五元，有的两三元不等。劳动较好的另外发给一部分奖励工资。供给部分和工资部分所占的比重，以新乡七里营人民公社为例，大体是全年每人平均供给部分五十元，工资部分（包括奖励工资）五十元，供给部分和工资部分各占一半。其他社，有的供给部分比重大些，有的工资部分比重大些。由于人民公社刚刚建立，各地经济条件不同，包的范围不可能一律，工资也不可能一致。但是不管怎样，吃饭不要钱，按月领工资，对农民说来，却是破天荒的大事。过去几年吃粮比较紧张，现在粮食这一关算是过来了。许多公共食堂都是这样：第一天吃得多，超过定量；第二天略有超过；第三天就退到原来的供应数字，或者接近原来的供应数字。这一下，一块石头落地了，农民满意了，干部也放心了。北戴河会议的时候，有的同志提出“吃饭不要钱”，现在看来，全面实行这个办法并不困难。我想，其他生活必需品也是这样，那一种产品丰富了，那一种就实行供给制的办法，按需分配和定量供给的部分逐步扩大，按劳取酬的部分逐步缩小，这样，一步一步地向共产主义过渡。至于说到在吃饭之外，还按月发给工资，农民更加满意。有的公社在第一次发工资的那天，举行了隆重的仪式，男女老少都到了会，农民领到工资以后，有的感动得落下泪来。吃饭不要钱，按月领工资，是一件具有世界意义的事。自从马克思提出共产主义这个远大理想以来，反对的人们有一条借口，就是实行各尽所能、各取所需的办法，会出懒汉。事实不然，实行部分供给制加基本工资加奖励工资的分配制度，人们不愁吃不愁穿了，现在他们考虑的是如何劳动得更好，才能对得起新社会，对得起共产党和毛主席。人们不是变懒了，而是更加勤劳，干劲更足。看来，逐步实行共产主义的经济制度，同提高人们的共产主义觉悟和道德品质，这两件事情是互相促进的。在这里，大家提出这样的问题：农民实行了半供给半工资的分配制度，在农村的国家工作人员怎么办？农村里实行了半供给半工资的分配制度，城市里怎么办？职工和国家工作人员怎么办？看来，形势逼人，这个问题必须及时加以考虑。
    （三）人民公社的建立，是我国社会又一次具有历史意义的重大变革，它必然要在生产、分配、交换、消费等方面引起一系列的深刻变化。根据我们在河北、河南看到的情况，这些变化主要有以下几点：
    第一，消灭了生产资料私有制的某些最后残余，进一步解放了生产力。有的富裕中农说：“这一下连根子也挖掉了”。小商小贩在很多地方已经绝迹，徐水全县已没有一个小商小贩。许多公社都是万人、万户以上的大社，人口多，范围广，力量大，劳力、物力和财力可以更加合理地调度使用，过去小社无法举办的事情，现在很快地办起来了。妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，成为公社的一支生力军。公社虽然建立不久，人们已经看到了它的优越性，也看到了共产主义的美好前景。群众的信心更足，干劲更大。
    第二，产品直接分配的部分扩大了，商品交换的比重缩小了。过去在手工业社和农业社之间、农业社和农业社之间、农民和农民之间，许多通过商品流通的产品，现在变为自产自用，在社内直接分配了。即是说，过去为出卖而生产的东西，现在变为为自己需要而生产了；过去需要从市场上购买的某些东西，现在自己也能够生产自给了。现在是这样的情况：公社用废钢铁，自己加工，制成滚珠轴承，就直接分配给各个生产队，安装到车上，不再通过买卖了。至于商品交换的部分，在新的情况下也发生了若干变化。许多商品过去由一家一户零星购买、零星出售，现在变为以社、队为单位集体购买、集体出售了。现在公共食堂用大篓买油，大包买盐，再也看不到一家一户油瓶站队、小包买盐了。由于组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化，商品的需求不同了。某些适合个体生活的商品如小锅、小杓等，没有销路或者销量大降了，而相反，适合集体生活的商品，销量却大大地增加了。
    第三，分配制度改变了，共产主义因素增长了。如前所说，许多公社已经由过去评工记分、夏秋预分、年终决分的分配办法，改为部分供给制和基本工资加奖励工资的办法。而工资又是发给劳动者个人，不再统一发给家长，冲破了旧的家长制。这是好事。人与人之间的关系在变化，人们的意识形态和精神面貌也在变化。
    第四，公社集体福利事业普遍发展了。我们看到的人民公社，大体上都办起了公共食堂、缝纫组、托儿所、幼儿园、老年幸福院、卫生院、妇产院等组织。过去由国家举办的许多事情，如医院、学校等，现在公社自己办起来了。许多公社社员从吃饭、穿衣、抚养子女到疾病医疗，现在都由公社统一负责，实现了家务劳动社会化。妇女们对公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园特别热心。她们说，这些组织“拆也拆不散，赶也赶不走了”。
    （四）人民公社化是社会经济的大改组，它改变着生产、分配、交换和消费等方面的旧的联系，建立着新的联系。这些变化反映在财政工作方面，是原来以商品流通为征税环节的工商税收制度，基本上不再适用了。这些变化反映在银行工作方面，是农村现金季节性投放和季节性回笼的规律改变了，现金交易进一步减少了，转账结算的范围扩大了。这些变化反映在商业、粮食工作方面，是采购和供应更加集中，计划性和组织性更加加强，经营方式和经营品种也有了变化，农村粮食统销任务基本上没有了。一个共同性的问题是，乡社合一了，人民公社既是经济组织，又是政权组织。国家的乡镇财政工作必须同公社本身的财务工作合而为一。农村银行机构将要进一步成为公社各种经济活动的结算中心。商业工作更加成为公社本身经济生活的不可分割的部分。在这种情况下，农村的财贸工作，在机构设置、业务管理等方面如何适应，如何处理有关的体制和工作关系等问题，也急需考虑解决。
    为了解决财贸工作如何适应人民公社化需要的问题，我们在北京的时候，曾经根据集中领导分级管理的原则，提出“两放、三统、一包”的方针。所谓两放，就是把财贸部门在农村的人员和资产下放到人民公社，由公社负责管理经营（不仅是财贸人员，国家在农村中的干部、包括乡干部、小学教员、各种事业机构的人员，看来也都要下放到人民公社）。所谓三统，就是统一政策，统一计划，统一流动资金的管理。人民公社必须执行国家的市场物价政策、统购统销政策以及其他方面的各项政策和有关规定；人民公社必须按照国家计划，交售统购和统一收购的产品，向社员配售统销物资；国家转交公社的流动资金，只能用于工农业生产和商品流转所需要的流动资金方面，不得用于基本建设和其他用途。所谓一包，就是包财政任务，将国家在农村中的各项财政收入，统一计算，扣除原来由国家开支的行政费和各种事业费用，由公社按收支差额包干上缴。这个两放、三统、一包的方针，我们这次在所到的地方，征求了当地党委和公社干部的意见，他们都同意，只是在包干的具体方法上，有不同的方案。例如，有的地方愿意按照一定的比例包干；有的地方愿意按照一定的金额包干。我想，各个地方的情况不尽相同，在公社统一包干上缴的方针下，包干的方法各地可以有所不同，不必强求一致。实行的具体时间、步骤，也可以因地制宜，自己规定。
    （五）有些县以上财贸部门的干部，顾虑实行两放三统一包的方针，把国家的机构下放给人民公社，是不是全民所有制向集体所有制后退了一步；有的同志顾虑这样作是不是会影响国家的收入；也有的同志顾虑事权下放了，没有事情可干了。我们说，人民公社是基层经济组织和基层政权组织的结合体，财贸机构下放以后，这些机构一方面是公社的组成部分，另一方面又是财贸部门的基层单位。比如说，公社的财政部门，既是公社的财务机关，又是国家的基层财政机构；公社的供销部既是公社的商品分配机构，又是国营商业的基层机构。财贸机构下放，实际上更增加了公社的全民所有制成分，加强了国家对人民公社的领导，更加便于公社将来进一步向全民所有制过渡。我看这不是倒退，而是前进。财贸机构下放，固然把国家的一部分财产和收入归了公社，但是最后，公社仍然要经过财政的渠道，把一定的收入上缴给国家，国家的收入并不会减少。至于说到财贸部门是不是无事可干的问题，应当认识，今后财贸部门对于公社的财贸机构，仍然保持着业务领导关系，国家财贸部门应当把公社的财贸工作看作自己的工作，把帮助公社做好财贸方面的工作，当作自己的重要任务。现在公社成立不久，各项工作还在建立，公社如何记账，如何核算，如何加强经营管理，加强计划性等，都需要帮助，怎么能说没有事情可干呢！吴芝圃同志说：“财贸工作的基础在公社”，这句话很对。就拿计划管理来说，目前的问题就很突出。例如鸡和鸡蛋，由于社员的自留地没有了，家里不作饭了，也没有功夫了，就必须及早纳入全面规划，想办法饲养。公社是工农商学兵五位一体，农林牧副渔全面发展，它本身就要求高度的计划性。哪一样事情不列入计划，哪一样事情就有被挤掉的危险。因此，推广合同制，即公社向国家出售什么，要国家供应什么，事前用合同规定下来，这是很必要的。把国家计划同公社计划通过合同衔接起来，看来将是今后长时期内国家同公社之间商业结合的主要形式。
          *　　　　*　　　　*
    以上的信是在郑州的时候写的。9月20日我们离开郑州，绕道南阳、襄樊，27日到武汉，30日回京。从湖北的情况看，他们那里采取的是更为慎重的步骤。他们先搭起人民公社的架子，下面还暂时未动，也没有实行吃粮不要钱的办法，他们主张批发商业以不缴给人民公社为好。我看这样做也可以，各地情况不同，具体作法不必强求一致。
