Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st October: "Plant late-season wheat well, resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of starting strong and finishing weak in autumn planting." This is a new instruction put forward by the Xuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party after completing the deep plowing of more than six million mu of early and mid-season fields.

Xuzhou Prefecture is one of the key wheat (wheat, barley, naked barley) producing areas in Jiangsu Province. This year, the area sown with three wheats in the region is more than 7.4 million mu, of which more than 1.3 million mu is late-season wheat. The autumn planting of early and mid-season crops was fast and of good quality. By the 15th, 6.34 million mu had been deep plowed, generally to a depth of about 1.5 chi, and 4.3 million mu had been sown. However, some cadres and the masses had the idea of starting strong and finishing weak, believing that the more than 1.3 million mu of late-season fields still had late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes and cotton growing, some were waterlogged depressions, harvesting and planting were squeezed together, and labor was tight, making it difficult to plant in a timely manner, and that "late planting will not reduce production." After discovering this situation, the Prefectural Committee promptly educated the cadres, pointing out that the quality of late-season wheat planting is greatly related to the realization of a 1,000-jin wheat yield per mu next year, and that the autumn planting task should not be relaxed in any step. It demanded that all localities ensure that late-season wheat does not lag behind, and that the specifications and quality catch up with early and mid-season crops.

Various localities have implemented the instructions of the Prefectural Committee, organizing labor to rush to harvest sweet potatoes and plant late-season fields well. Ganyu County has adopted methods such as harvesting, plowing, preparing the ridges, fertilizing, and sowing at the same time, and deep plowing every other furrow in the sweet potato ditches in advance, and the progress is very fast. The county has already planted more than 157,000 mu of late-season wheat. Now, more than 1.8 million people in the entire prefecture are engaged in autumn harvesting and planting, and it is expected that the autumn planting will be completed around the time of "Frost's Descent".

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 21st October: More than two million soldiers in the Huaibei Plain, Anhui, are taking various measures to improve the quality of sowing.

On the vast wilderness, there are camps everywhere, and many labor armies live on the battlefield. In the Bengbu Prefecture, more than 530,000 people are stationed in the fields, carrying out autumn plowing and planting day and night. More than 500,000 newly trained technical soldiers throughout Huaibei are even busier, widely imparting new technologies such as deep plowing, ridge planting, and close planting to all companies. Although it has been raining a lot in Huaibei recently, the daily sowing progress is still more than 600,000 mu, and the quality mostly meets the standards. All localities have generally implemented an autumn planting inspection and acceptance system. In Huaibei counties of Bengbu Prefecture, more than 14,900 cadres at all levels have formed more than 2,500 inspection and acceptance teams. They work with the masses, set an example, and at the same time, use their rest time to conduct inspections and acceptance according to the autumn planting standards, and combine evaluations and competitions to promptly introduce the experience of advanced units to promote the progress of backward units.

In order to solve the contradiction between improving the quality of autumn planting and the lack of labor, all localities attach great importance to the promotion of various farming tools such as rope-drawn tractors, double-layer deep plows, and close-planting drills. In Fuyang Prefecture alone, more than 4 million pieces of various farming tools have been promoted. In many people's communes and teams in Bengbu Prefecture, rope-drawn tractors are used to deeply plow the land, thus improving efficiency and ensuring quality.

    秋播工作要善始善终
    徐州专区批判虎头蛇尾思想种好晚茬麦
    淮北地区采取各种措施保证秋种质量
    新华社南京21日电　“种好晚茬麦，坚决消灭秋播工作中虎头蛇尾的现象”。这是中共徐州地委在完成六百多万亩早、中茬田深翻后提出来的一项新指示。
    徐州专区是江苏省三麦（小麦、大麦、元麦）的重点产区之一。今年全区三麦播种面积是七百四十多万亩，其中晚茬麦有一百三十多万亩。早、中茬的秋播速度快，质量好，到15日已深翻六百三十四万亩，普遍深耕一尺五左右，已播种四百三十万亩。但部分干部和群众有虎头蛇尾的思想，认为一百三十多万亩晚茬田有的还长着甘薯、棉花等晚秋作物，有的是积水洼地，收和种挤在一起，劳力紧张，很难做到适时播种，并认为“迟种了也不会减产”。地委发现这一情况后，及时教育干部，指出晚茬麦种得好坏，对明年实现三麦千斤专区有很大关系，秋种任务要一步不让。要求各地保证做到晚茬麦不拖后腿，规格质量要赶上早、中茬。
    各地贯彻执行地委指示，组织劳力抢收甘薯，种好晚茬田。赣榆县采取边收、边翻、边整畦、边施肥、边播种和事先在甘薯沟里隔垄深翻等办法，进度很快，全县已种晚茬麦十五万七千多亩。现在全专区每天有一百八十多万人投入秋收秋种，预计“霜降”前后可以全部结束秋播。
    新华社合肥21日电　安徽淮北平原二百多万秋耕秋种大军采取各种措施提高播种质量。
    在辽阔的原野上，目前到处是营棚，很多劳动大军食宿不离战场。蚌埠专区就有五十三万多人驻扎在田头，日夜进行秋耕秋种。全淮北新训练的五十多万个技术兵更是繁忙，他们向所有连队广泛传授深耕、作畦田、密植等新技术。虽然近日来淮北多雨，但每天的播种进度仍在六十万亩以上，质量大都符合标准。各地普遍实行了秋种检查验收制度。蚌埠专区淮北各县由各级干部一万四千九百多人组成了二千五百多个检查验收小组。他们和群众一同劳动，作出榜样，同时利用休息时间，根据秋种标准进行检查验收，并结合评比竞赛，及时介绍先进单位的经验，推动落后单位前进。
    为了解决提高秋种质量和劳动力缺乏之间的矛盾，各地都很重视绳索牵引机、双层深耕犁、密植耧等各种耕种工具的推广工作。仅阜阳专区各种耕种工具就已推广了四百多万件。蚌埠专区很多人民公社队队都用绳索牵引机深翻土地，因此提高了效率，保证了质量。
