Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: The Xuchang Special District of Henan Province is vigorously developing indigenous steelmaking methods, and the daily steel output has broken through the 10,000-ton mark. In one day, from 6:00 a.m. on the 10th to 6:00 a.m. on the 11th, the entire special district produced a total of 12,583.6 tons of steel. Among them, Lushan County, famous for launching "satellites" in iron smelting, produced 7,030.25 tons of steel daily, and Yu County produced 5,017 tons of steel daily.

	On the 10th, in the Xuchang area, steel sparks flew from thousands of small indigenous furnaces, and the mountains and plains were shimmering with red light. A total of 225,000 steel warriors in the district were fighting tensely beside 14,240 steelmaking furnaces.

	The breakthrough of 10,000 tons of steel in the Xuchang Special District is another major victory in implementing the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass." The steel army of the entire district overcame numerous difficulties with steely willpower. Lacking tools, they contributed their own tools or made them themselves. The masses in Lushan County alone contributed 11,702 bellows, 10,248 blacksmith hammers, and 1,215 large and small drills, and rushed to make 4,423 stone anvils. On the steel front, touching new people and new things emerged everywhere. Wang Yinhua, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Huolongmiao combat camp in Yu County, originally planned to get married on October 1st, but in order to complete the steel production plan, she repeatedly postponed her wedding. Her family sent people to the construction site several times to pick her up, but she refused. She expressed her determination to the Party, saying: "Mulan went to the army for the country, I dedicate my youth to steel, I am not afraid of wind and rain, I will not marry until the task is completed."

	In order to mobilize the launching of the big "satellite" of indigenous steelmaking, in addition to having made preparations for ideological, manpower, material, and technical aspects, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the various counties, most of the cadres personally went to the front line to command and supervise the battle. The Lushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized 1,910 party members and cadres to go deep into the furnace front to command.

    千万土炉钢花飞溅
    许昌专区日产万吨钢
    据新华社郑州12日电　河南省许昌专区大搞土法炼钢，钢的日产量突破万吨大关。从10日早晨六点到11日早晨六点一天内，全专区共出钢一二五八三·六吨。其中，在炼铁方面连放“卫星”而闻名的鲁山县日产钢七○三○·二五吨，禹县日产钢五○一七吨。
    10日这天，许昌地区千万座小土炉钢花飞溅，满山遍野红光闪闪。全区有二十二万五千名钢铁战士紧张地战斗在一万四千二百四十座炼钢炉旁。
    许昌专区突破炼钢万吨大关，是执行“小、土、群”方针的又一次重大胜利。全区钢铁大军以钢铁般的顽强意志，克服了重重困难。缺乏工具，他们就把自己的工具献出来或者自己动手制造。仅鲁山县群众就献出风箱一万一千七百零二个、打铁锤一万零二百四十八个、大小钎子一千二百一十五把，又用石头赶造了四千四百二十三个石砧子。在钢铁前线，到处出现了感人的新人新事。禹县火龙庙战斗营共青团员王银花，原计划10月1日结婚，但是她为了完成钢铁生产计划，一再推迟婚期，家里几次派人到工地去接，都被她拒绝了，她向党表示决心说：木兰为国去从军，我为钢铁献青春，不怕风吹和雨打，不完任务不结婚。
    为了动员发射土法炼钢的大“卫星”，中共许昌地委和各县除了早就作了思想、人力、物资、技术等方面的准备工作以外，全区干部大部分亲自上前线，指挥督战。中共鲁山县委就组织了一千九百一十名党员干部深入炉前指挥。
