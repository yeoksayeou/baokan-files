Xinhua News Agency, 20th—American aggressors continue to engage in military provocations and atomic intimidation in the Taiwan Strait area, attempting to intensify the grave situation in this region.

Hubbard, commander of Task Force 75 of the US Seventh Fleet's cruiser division, bluntly confessed to the serious provocative acts of U.S. warships constantly intruding into our territorial waters.

He said, "This fleet ignores the repeated serious warnings from the Chinese Communists about U.S. warships intruding into Chinese Communist territorial waters. Our patrol vessels have consistently sailed within twelve nautical miles of the mainland." He said that the United States "always has a heavy cruiser with its eight-inch guns in a state of readiness," and that "there is always a cruiser either in the strait or very close by, ready to proceed immediately" to the mainland coast "if ordered to bombard those Communist coastal guns."

Hubbard said that during the U.S. Navy's so-called "escort" activities, the patrol force under his command increased by about 50%, with the number of destroyers increasing from eight to twelve.

A dispatch yesterday from the American aircraft carrier "Midway" by an American news agency reporter shows that the U.S. Seventh Fleet is intensifying its warmongering in the Taiwan Strait. The dispatch quoted Clark, commander of Task Force 77 of the U.S. Seventh Fleet aircraft carrier division, as clamoring that the United States "is still operating at the same speed as it did in the initial stages of the crisis in this area. We are ready to enter a state of total war if necessary."

Both Clark and Hubbard unwittingly exposed the truth about the U.S.'s so-called reduction of forces in the Taiwan Strait. They said that these "withdrawn" warships "are not too far away" and "can be redeployed in a very short time."

Clark said that the 45,000-ton aircraft carrier "Ticonderoga," currently in Hawaiian waters, will be transferred to the Taiwan Strait to join his fleet, replacing one of the current four aircraft carriers in the fleet. These four aircraft carriers are the "Midway," "Lexington," "Shangri-La," and "Bennington." In addition, the 72,000-ton U.S. aircraft carrier "Ranger" will also be transferred this winter.

American war-mongers are also rampantly engaging in atomic blackmail against our country. Clark clamored that U.S. "air force units are ready to be in a state of full war immediately." Reports say that during the numerous maritime supply operations currently being conducted in the waters off Okinawa, "some nuclear warheads in containers and some accessories have been transported from U.S. supply ships to the aircraft carrier 'Midway.'" The report says that combat fighter patrols launched from the aircraft carrier equipped with "Sidewinder" and "Sparrow-III" missiles are conducting ten to twelve patrol flights over the Taiwan Strait every twenty-four hours.

### 美国侵略者在台湾海峡张牙舞爪  所谓减少兵力是假　加紧进行挑衅是真

    美国侵略者在台湾海峡张牙舞爪
    所谓减少兵力是假　加紧进行挑衅是真
    新华社20日讯　美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区继续进行军事挑衅和原子恫吓，图谋加剧这一地区的严重局势。
    美国第七舰队第七十五巡洋舰特遣部队司令哈伯德直言不讳地供认了美国舰艇不断侵入我国领海的严重挑衅行为。
    他说，“这个舰队不理会中国共产党提出的所谓美国军舰侵入中国共产党领海的各次严重警告。我们的巡逻舰只始终是在离大陆十二海里以内的地方行驶。”他说，美国“一艘重巡洋舰始终使它的八英寸口径的大炮处于准备状态”，并且“始终有一艘巡洋舰不是在海峡中，便是在非常靠近的地方，以便一接到命令马上前往”大陆沿海，“如果接到命令要轰击那些共产党沿海大炮的话”。
    哈伯德说，在美国海军进行所谓“护航”活动期间，他统辖的巡逻部队增加了大约50％的力量，驱逐舰数目从八艘增加到十二艘。
    美国通讯社记者昨天从美舰“中途号”发出的消息，表明美国第七舰队正在台湾海峡加紧玩火。消息中引用美国第七舰队第七十七航空母舰特遣舰队司令克拉克的叫嚣说，美国“仍旧用在这个地区危机发生初期所用的那种速度在进行活动。我们已经准备好在必要时进入完全的战争状态”。
    克拉克和哈伯德都不打自招地拆穿了美国所谓已经减少台湾海峡兵力的真相。他们说，这些“撤走”的军舰“离得并不太远”，而且“能够在很短的时间内重新派来”。
    克拉克说，目前在夏威夷海面的四万五千吨的航空母舰“提康德罗加号”将调到台湾海峡参加他的舰队，以代替目前舰队中四艘航空母舰的一艘。这四艘航空母舰是“中途号”、“列克星吞号”、“香格里拉号”和“本宁含号”。另外，美国七万二千吨的航空母舰“徘徊者号”也将在今年冬天调来。
    美国战争贩子还猖狂地对我国继续进行原子讹诈。克拉克叫嚷美国“空军部队随时准备立即处于全面的战争状态”。有消息说，目前在冲绳海面举行的多次海上供应行动中，已经“从美国供应船只把一些装在容器中的核弹头和一些配件运上了‘中途号’航空母舰”。消息说，从航空母舰起飞的装有“响尾蛇”式和“麻雀——三式”导弹的战斗机巡逻队，每二十四小时要在台湾海峡作十次到十二次的巡逻飞行。
