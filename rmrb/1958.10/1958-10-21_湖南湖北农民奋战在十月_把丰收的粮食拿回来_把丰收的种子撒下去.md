Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Dispatch: The Hunan Provincial Party Committee has requested the entire province to strive to basically complete the autumn harvest and winter sowing tasks by the end of October. As of the 15th, the province had harvested 10 million mu of autumn-ripe crops, winter sowing had reached 18.36 million mu, and manure accumulation had reached 20.4 billion dan.

Hunan Province needs to harvest 40 million mu of autumn-ripe crops, sow 30 million mu of winter crops, and the tasks of deep plowing and manure accumulation are also very heavy. Therefore, October is a crucial point to seize the complete victory of this year's agriculture and also a crucial point to strive for a greater leap forward in agriculture next year. However, some cadres and masses believe that industry has drawn a large number of laborers, and agricultural labor cannot be arranged, so they have no confidence in completing the autumn harvest and winter planting as scheduled, or they think that steel is now in command, and it does not matter if agriculture is relaxed a little. In response to this idea, party committees at all levels widely organized cadres and the masses to conduct a great airing of views, a great debate on issues such as "whether industry and agriculture should leap forward at the same time." Through presenting facts and reasoning, the right-leaning conservative ideas and retreating emotions were criticized, and a new upsurge in agricultural production was set off. First, according to the principle that industry and agriculture must leap forward at the same time, all localities made a comprehensive plan for labor and formed various specialized teams for labor invested in agricultural production. They also adopted the "four fixings" method of fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing time, and fixing leadership to improve work efficiency. Second, the organization was resolutely militarized, actions were combative, and life was collectivized. Xiangtan Prefecture ran public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries in a big way, liberating 920,000 women from household labor and putting them into production. Third, all localities resolutely promoted the method of large-scale corps operations, while implementing field camping, moving eating, rest, meetings, childcare, medical treatment, and tool repairs to the fields, reducing the time spent traveling to and from the construction site and the phenomenon of wasted work. Fourth, all localities carried out technological innovations and improved work efficiency. On the 15th, 14 million agricultural troops in the province fought hard in the rain, harvesting 3.35 million mu of autumn crops, sowing 1.9 million mu of winter crops, deep plowing 1.43 million mu, and accumulating 1.47 billion dan of manure.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch: Hubei Province is accelerating the autumn harvest and winter sowing, striving for a double harvest of steel and agriculture. As of the 13th, the province had harvested 20.85 million mu of grain crops, including middle rice and soybeans, which have been basically harvested. Now, the single-season late rice is being harvested. Nearly 9 million mu of cotton that should be harvested have been picked twice, and half of them have been picked more than four times. More than 11 million mu of land in the province have been planted with wheat, barley, beans, and rapeseed. 15.88 million mu of land have been deeply ploughed, and the quality has been improved compared with last year, with most areas reaching more than one foot. The province has completed 62% of the winter sowing manure accumulation plan, and the amount of manure accumulation has reached more than 25 billion dan. Now, from the prefectural, county, and commune party committees to the production teams, special teams have been established. In addition to the first secretary in charge of steel and agriculture, a strong secretary is designated to take charge of agriculture. Party committees at all levels have made comprehensive arrangements for labor, and have also mobilized a large number of elderly, children, and part-time students to participate in the autumn harvest and winter sowing as auxiliary labor.

In some counties and districts of Hubei Province, in the previous period, due to insufficient understanding of the principle of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the phenomenon of no one harvesting the ripe autumn grain and no one picking the burst cotton peaches occurred. In response to this situation, all localities carried out a mass war-zone rectification, mobilized the masses to air their views, debate freely, and criticize wrong ideas. On the basis of unifying understanding, all counties and communes made comprehensive arrangements for labor, gave full play to the superiority of communization, implemented militarized organization, collectivized life, and combative action, tapped labor potential, and achieved "everyone has something to do, and everything has someone to do." All localities also vigorously carried out tool reforms and launched labor competitions, which greatly promoted production.

    湖南湖北农民奋战在十月
    把丰收的粮食拿回来
    把丰收的种子撒下去
    据新华社长沙电　中共湖南省委要求全省力争在10月底基本完成秋收、冬播任务。到15日止，全省秋熟作物已收割一千万亩，冬播已达一千八百三十六万亩，积肥已达二百零四亿担。
    湖南省要收割四千万亩秋熟作物，播种三千万亩越冬作物，深耕、积肥的任务也很繁重。因此10月是夺取今年农业全胜的一关，也是争取明年农业更大跃进的一关。可是部分干部和群众认为工业抽出了大批劳力，农业上劳力安排不过来，对如期完成秋收冬种没有信心，或者认为现在是钢铁挂帅，农业放松点没有关系。针对这种思想，各地党委广泛组织干部和群众就“工农业要不要同时跃进”等问题，开展了大鸣大放大辩论。通过摆事实、讲道理，批判了右倾保守思想和退缩情绪，使农业生产掀起了新的高潮。首先各地根据工农业必须同时跃进的方针，对劳动力进行了全面规划，投入农业生产的劳力，都组成了各种专业队，并采取了定任务、定质量、定时间、定领导的“四定”办法，以提高工效。其次，坚决实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化。湘潭专区大办公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所，使九十二万妇女从家务劳动中解放出来，投入了生产。第三，各地坚决推广了大兵团作战的方法，同时实行田间扎营，把吃饭、休息、开会、托儿、医疗、工具修理搬到田间，减少了往返工地时间和窝工现象。第四，各地开展技术革新，提高了工效。在15日这一天，全省一千四百万农业大军冒雨奋战，就秋收三百三十五万亩，冬播一百九十万亩，深耕一百四十三万亩，积肥十四亿七千万担。
    据新华社武汉电　湖北省加速秋收冬播，力争钢铁农业双丰收。全省到13日止，粮食作物已经收割二千零八十五万亩，其中中稻、大豆都已基本收割完毕，现在正收割一季晚稻。应收的近九百万亩棉花，已普遍拣了二次花，其中半数拣花四次以上。全省已有一千一百多万亩地种上了小麦、大麦、豆类和油菜。深耕一千五百八十八万亩土地，质量比去年提高，大部分地区达到一尺以上。全省冬播积肥计划已完成62％，积肥量达二百五十多亿担。现在，各地从地委、县委、公社到生产队，都建立了专门班子，除第一书记主管钢铁兼管农业外，都确定一位强有力的书记专管农业。各级党委对劳动力都作了全面安排，还动员了大批老人、小孩、半工半读的学生等辅助劳动力参加秋收冬播。
    湖北省部分县区，前一时期由于对工农业同时并举的方针认识不足，出现秋粮熟了无人收，棉桃炸了无人拣的现象。针对这一情况，各地开展了全民性的战地整风，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，批判错误思想。在统一认识的基础上，各县、社又对劳动力作了全面安排，充分发挥公社化以后的优越性，实行组织军事化、生活集体化、行动战斗化，挖掘劳动潜力，做到“人人有事做，事事有人做”。各地还大搞工具改革，开展劳动竞赛，对生产起了很大的推动作用。
