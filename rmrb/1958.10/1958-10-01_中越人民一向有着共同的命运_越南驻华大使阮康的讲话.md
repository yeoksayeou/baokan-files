Esteemed Vice-Chairman Zhu De, dear friends, comrades:

    Today is the founding day of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, and also the founding day of the China Friendship Association with various socialist countries. Today, this day of great friendship between China and the fraternal socialist countries, happily coincides with China's National Day. This is not only a joyous festival for the people of China and Vietnam, but also a festival for all countries in the socialist camp. I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people on their National Day, to the founding of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association, and to the festival of solidarity and friendship among all countries in our socialist camp.

    China and Vietnam have had a profound friendship since ancient times, with a long history of relations in politics, economics, and culture. The people of our two neighboring countries have always shared a common destiny. For centuries, the people of our two countries suffered the cruel rule of feudal landlords, and in the last hundred years, we have both suffered the barbaric aggression and oppression of imperialism, and have fought side by side against this aggression and oppression. Today, the people of our two countries are exerting all our strength to fight against the common enemy who interferes in our two countries' internal affairs, obstructs the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and undermines the Vietnamese people's efforts to realize national reunification – U.S. imperialism. Throughout this long struggle from the past to the present, the people of our two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other. Therefore, the friendship between our two peoples has a long tradition and is incomparably close, constantly developing and deepening. However, only when our two countries had the leadership of the working-class parties, and when our two countries were liberated, did this friendship truly blossom and bear fruit. It truly blossomed and bore fruit because it has developed on the new and solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The fact is that on this basis, the Chinese Communist Party and the Vietnam Workers' Party have educated the people of our two countries to cherish each other like family members, to love and help each other, to unite and resist the common enemy of U.S. imperialism in order to completely liberate our own territories; to learn from each other and cooperate closely in building socialism. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are constantly strengthening their friendship with the Chinese people, learning valuable revolutionary experience from our great brothers.

    It is precisely because of learning from the valuable experience of the Soviet Union and China, and because of our own efforts, that the Vietnamese people defeated the French imperialist colonialists, won a fundamental victory in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, and forced the bellicose imperialists to sign the Geneva ceasefire agreement, thereby liberating half of our country. Since the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people have begun to restore the motherland that has been devastated by years of war and are fighting for the reunification of the country. In the process of reconstruction and struggle, the Vietnamese people have encountered many difficulties. But just like during the anti-war period, the Vietnamese people today are receiving sympathy, support, and assistance from the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the great Chinese people are assisting the Vietnamese people in all aspects of construction, providing great assistance in terms of experience, materials, technology, and experts. Today, the Vietnamese people have successfully completed the period of restoring the national economy and have entered the period of developing the economy and culture in accordance with long-term plans within this year and have begun socialist construction. Vietnam has always believed that all the achievements it has made are inseparable from the wholehearted assistance of the fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China. The Vietnamese people express their heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government for this wholehearted assistance.

    The Vietnamese people have always regarded the victories and achievements of the Chinese people as their own victories and achievements and see it as a huge source of encouragement. The Vietnamese people are very pleased to see that in the past nine years, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the cause of socialist construction. Through the rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, on the basis of ideological liberation, and under the brilliant light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Chinese people have created miracles that have shaken the world. Today, the spirit of the all-round Great Leap Forward has become a major turning point in the history of socialist construction in China and is also an example for the Vietnamese people to learn from. The Vietnamese people believe that the experience gained by the Chinese people in construction will be of great benefit to the Vietnamese people. It will further enhance the Vietnamese people's confidence in carrying out socialist construction in their own country.

    At present, the Chinese people are fighting against the provocations of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism has invaded South Vietnam, occupied China's territory of Taiwan, and is deliberately creating tension in the Taiwan Strait area. The Vietnamese people strongly condemn U.S. imperialism and warmly support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands. Recently, in major cities of Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of people held demonstrations, firmly stating that if U.S. imperialism dares to risk provoking a new war, then the Vietnamese people will fight alongside the Chinese people to fiercely attack our common enemy.

    Looking back at the development of Sino-Vietnamese friendship, the Vietnamese people are pleased to see that this friendship has been continuously developed and consolidated. In recent years, our two countries have been increasingly close and frequent in mutual assistance, mutual learning, mutual cooperation, and friendly exchanges. The various relations between our two countries are more extensive and profound than ever before. Today, on this day of historical friendship for our two peoples, it brings a new and important event: the establishment of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association. The establishment of this association is fully in line with the wishes of our two peoples. The Vietnamese people, overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and overseas Vietnamese in China will feel extremely happy and encouraged when they receive this good news. There is no doubt that the establishment of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association will further develop and consolidate our two countries' long-standing, traditional, and fraternal friendship. We warmly congratulate the establishment of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association and wish the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association brilliant achievements in its work. We firmly believe that the close friendship between China and Vietnam is not only beneficial to our two countries, but also extremely beneficial to the further consolidation of our powerful socialist camp and to the cause of safeguarding world peace.

    Let us shout together:
    -- Warmly welcome the establishment of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association!
    -- May the long-standing, traditional, fraternal friendship between Vietnam and China last forever!
    -- Long live the unbreakable unity and friendship among the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    中越人民一向有着共同的命运
    越南驻华大使阮康的讲话敬爱的朱德副主席，亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    今天是中越友好协会成立的日子，同时也是成立中国和各社会主义国家友好协会的日子。今天，这个中国和兄弟般的各社会主义国家伟大友谊的日子，正好欣逢中国国庆节。这不仅是中越两国人民的欢乐佳节，而且是社会主义阵营各国的佳节。我谨为兄弟般的中国人民的国庆节，为中越友好协会的成立，为我们社会主义阵营各国的团结和友谊节日，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    越中两国自古以来就有着深厚的友谊，不论在政治、经济和文化各方面的关系都有着悠久的历史。我们两个毗邻国家的人民一向有着共同的命运。多少世纪以来，我们两国人民同样遭受封建地主阶级的残酷统治，在近百年来我们两国人民又同样遭到帝国主义野蛮的侵略和压迫，而且曾经并肩一起为反抗这种侵略和压迫而共同进行斗争。今天，我们两国人民又正在竭尽力量为反对干涉我们两国的内政、阻挠中国人民解放台湾和破坏越南人民实现祖国统一的共同敌人——美帝国主义而作着猛烈的斗争。从以前到现在的这个长久的斗争过程中，我们两国人民一直相互同情和支持。因此，我们两国人民的友谊是有着悠久传统和无比亲切的，它不断地得到发展和日益深厚。但是，只有在我们两国都有了工人阶级的政党领导、我们两国都得到了解放的时候，这种友谊才真正的开花结果。它所以真正的开花结果，是因为它已在新的和稳固的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义精神的基础上发展起来。事实是，在这个基础上，中国共产党和越南劳动党已教育我们两国人民要像一家人似的互相爱护，相亲相助，彼此互相疼惜，团结一致来抗击美帝国主义这个公敌，以便完全解放自己的国土；互相学习和紧密地进行合作来建设社会主义事业。越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下，不断地加强同中国人民的友谊关系，向伟大的兄弟学习革命的宝贵经验。
    正是由于学习了苏联和中国的宝贵经验，同时由于自身的努力，越南人民已打败了法国帝国主义殖民者，在奠边府战役中赢得根本胜利，迫使好战的帝国主义不得不签订日内瓦停火协议，从而解放了我们一半的国土。自从和平恢复以来，越南人民着手恢复多少年来遭受战争摧残的祖国，并为祖国的统一而进行斗争。在复兴和斗争中，越南人民曾经碰到不少困难。但正像在抗战期间一样，越南人民今天又得到苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的同情支持和帮助。在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，伟大的中国人民协助越南人民进行各方面的建设，不论在经验上、物质、技术和专家等等方面都给予很大的帮助。今天，越南人民已胜利地结束了恢复国民经济时期，并在今年内跨进按照长期规划发展经济和文化的时期，已开始进行社会主义建设。越南向来认为自己所取得的一切成就，是同各兄弟国家、首先是苏联和中国的尽心协力的帮助分不开的。对于这种尽心竭力的帮助，越南人民衷心地向中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府深表谢意。
    越南人民一向把中国人民所取得的胜利和成就看成是自己的胜利和成就，并把它作为一个巨大的鼓舞力量。越南人民怀着非常愉快的心情看到，九年来，中国人民在社会主义建设事业中已取得了伟大的胜利。通过整风和反右派的斗争，在思想解放的基础上，和在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，中国人民已经创造了震动世界的奇迹。今天，全面大跃进的气派，已成为中国人民在社会主义建设史上的重大转折点，同时也是越南人民学习的一个范例。越南人民认为中国人民在建设事业上所取得的经验，对越南人民来说将有很大的益处。它将使越南人民更加增强在自己的祖国进行社会主义建设的信心。
    目下，中国人民正为反对美帝国主义的挑衅而斗争。美帝国主义已侵入越南南方，占领中国的领土台湾，并且蓄意在台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势。越南人民强烈谴责美帝国主义，并热烈支持中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争。最近，在越南各大城市，数以几十万计的群众举行示威游行，坚决表示，美帝国主义如果胆敢冒险挑起新的战争，那么越南人民将和中国人民并肩一起来痛击共同的死敌。
    回顾越中友谊的发展过程，越南人民高兴地看到，这种友谊已经不断地得到发展和巩固。近几年来，我们两国之间的互相协助、互相学习、互相合作和友好往来日趋于密切和频繁。我们两国间的各种关系比任何时候都要扩展和深厚。今天，在这个对于我们两国人民具有历史性的友谊的日子里，它带来了一个新的重要的事件：中越友好协会成立了。这个协会的成立是完全符合我们两国人民的愿望的。越南人民，旅越的华侨和旅华的越侨，当他们得到这个喜讯时，将感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。毋庸置疑的，中越友好协会的成立将是我们两国悠久的、传统的和兄弟般亲切的友谊愈加发展和巩固。我们热烈祝贺中越友好协会的成立，并祝中越友好协会的工作取得光辉的成就。我们深信，中越友谊关系的密切不但对我们两国有利，而且对我们强大的社会主义阵营的进一步巩固和对保卫世界和平事业也都极其有利。
    让我们一同高呼：
    ——热烈欢迎中越友好协会的成立；
    ——越中两国之间悠久的、传统的、兄弟般的友谊万古长青；
    ——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的牢不可破的团结友谊万岁！
