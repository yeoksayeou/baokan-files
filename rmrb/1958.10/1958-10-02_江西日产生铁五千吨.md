Jiangxi Daily Iron Production Reaches 5,000 Tons

(Our dispatch) Jiangxi Province has achieved significant results in the first battle of iron and steel production. On the 29th, the province's daily pig iron production reached 5,005 tons, nearly twenty times higher than the peak daily output in mid-September. Among them, Yongxin County's daily output reached 1,013 tons.

Before July, except for the Pingxiang Iron and Steel Plant, which could produce a dozen tons of pig iron per day, almost no place in Jiangxi Province could produce iron. After the Provincial Party Committee decided to build Jiangxi into a new iron and steel base, indigenous blast furnaces and small blast furnaces sprang up like mushrooms. By the end of August, daily pig iron production had leaped to more than 180 tons. At the Provincial Party Committee's expanded meeting held from September 6th to 12th, the issue of iron and steel production was emphasized, and the main reasons for the slow progress of iron and steel production were examined. The following decisions were made: First, the entire party should shift its leadership focus to industry, with the First Secretary taking command, responsible comrades personally going to the front lines, and the entire party grasping iron and steel production; second, two million iron and steel troops should be mobilized to form specialized teams for furnace construction, smelting, mining, coal mining, and transportation, with party and league members as the core, to enhance the combat effectiveness of the iron and steel front; third, adhere to the principle of mainly small and indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and require the establishment of iron smelting furnaces mainly based on small and indigenous methods in areas with convenient transportation and abundant raw materials; fourth, carry out communist large-scale collaboration. Immediately afterwards, from the Provincial Party Committee Secretary to the Township Party Committee Secretary, they led 100,000 cadres and more than 2 million troops, and immediately threw themselves into intense and fierce battles, greatly promoting the progress of iron and steel production, causing daily output to increase again and again.

On the eve of National Day, this battle became even more intense, and no one was willing to lag behind. Everywhere in the mountains and plains, there were busy crowds. On this day, Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, and Secretaries Shao Shiping, Fang Zichun, Liu Junxiu, Bai Dongcai, etc., respectively, joined the masses in fighting in Anfu, Pingxiang, Boyang and other places.

    江西日产生铁五千吨
    本报讯　江西省在钢铁生产的第一次战役中，已经获得显著的战果，29日全省日产生铁达五千零五吨，比9月中旬的最高日产量提高将近二十倍。其中永新县日产量达到一千零一十三吨。
    7月以前，江西省除了萍乡钢铁厂能够日产十几吨生铁以外，几乎没有一个地方能产生铁。在省委决定要把江西建成为一个新的钢铁基地以后，土高炉、小高炉如雨后春笋一样大量出现，到8月底，生铁日产量就跃进到一百八十多吨。在9月6日到12日召开的省委扩大会议上，着重地研究了钢铁生产问题，检查了钢铁生产进度迟缓的主要原因。决定：一，全党把领导重心转到工业，做到第一书记挂帅，负责同志亲临战线，全党抓钢铁；二，动员二百万钢铁大军组成建炉、炼炉、采矿、挖煤、运输等专业队，以党、团员为核心，增强钢铁战线的战斗力；三，坚持以小以土为主，土洋结合的方针，要求在交通方便、原料丰富的地区，建立起以小以土为主的炼铁炉；四，开展共产主义大协作。紧接着从省委书记到乡党委书记分别领导十万干部和二百多万大军，并且立即投入了紧张激烈的战斗，大大地促进了钢铁生产的进展，使日产量一翻再翻。
    国庆前夕这场战斗更加激烈了，他们谁也不甘落后一步。满山遍野，到处是繁忙的人群。在这一天，江西省委第一书记杨尚奎，书记邵式平、方志纯、刘俊秀、白栋材等分别在安福、萍乡、波阳等地，和群众一道投入战斗。
