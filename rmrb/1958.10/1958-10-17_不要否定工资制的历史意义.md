Title: Do Not Negate the Historical Significance of the Wage System

After reading Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's article "Destroying the Bourgeois Concept of Law" on the seventh page of the People's Daily on October 13th, I have a few thoughts.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao's evaluation of the supply system previously implemented by our party in the first half of the article is correct. I completely support the emphasis on putting politics in command and not putting money in command. However, completely negating the historical significance of the wage system and equating the wage system with the "hierarchy" in the article is not appropriate.

First of all, the wage system is not something inherent to our party. After the founding of New China, what the country took over from the Kuomintang reactionaries was a poor situation that had been destroyed by long-term war. Most enterprises were still owned by private capitalists. At that time, in order to stabilize the market and support the People's Liberation Army in pursuing and annihilating the remaining enemies, was it better to maintain the original wage system for employees in the enterprises taken over, or to change it to the supply system? Of course, the former was better. Over the past nine years, the state has made many reforms to the wage system left over from the old society. As for the staff of state organs, it was only after 1952 that they gradually changed from the supply system to the wage system. The great achievements in industrial production from liberation to today include the factor of the socialist wage system based on the principle of distribution according to work under the leadership of the Party. Although the current wage system still has shortcomings and needs to be continuously improved, it cannot be denied the historical role it once played. Today, it has not completely lost its function as a form of social material distribution. Marx wrote in "Critique of the Gotha Program" regarding the principle of distribution in socialist society: "What we are dealing with here is not a communist society which has developed on its own foundations, but on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society – after the deductions have been made – exactly what he gives to it." Although Marx believed that this principle of distribution had shortcomings, he said, "These defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby." At the same time, he further pointed out: "In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly – only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed completely and the society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!” (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Two-Volume Edition, Volume 2, pp. 21-23). Currently, under the situation of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in our country, workers and peasants have launched soaring enthusiasm, and production has increased by multiples or even dozens of times. The piece-rate wage system no longer plays a role in promoting production, but hinders it. It is completely correct for workers to voluntarily propose abolishing the piece-rate wage system and adopting the time-rate wage system. This is a concrete manifestation of the lofty communist style of our working class. However, this does not mean that the wage system implemented in the past was wrong, or that the wage system can be abolished now. The current system of half-supply and half-wage implemented by rural people's communes is basically still a system of distribution according to work in the socialist period. However, it must be seen that this system of half-supply and half-wage already contains the seeds of communism.

Secondly, it is also problematic to juxtapose the wage system with the feudal hierarchy in the article. I believe that the wage system implemented today cannot be compared with the feudal hierarchy. It cannot be considered that the implementation of the wage system means that there is a hierarchy. Nor can it be considered that some cadres have "quickly learned the airs of gentlemen, the airs of the upper class, and the airs of Master Zhao" because of the implementation of the wage system, and that "they feel uncomfortable if they don't address someone as 'Chief' when they meet"; and that it "stimulates the enthusiasm for competing for fame in the court and competing for profit in the market, and stimulates the enthusiasm for extravagance and waste, not feeling ashamed but feeling honored…". The problem cannot be understood in this way. Where can it be seen that some cadres have quickly learned the airs of gentlemen, the airs of the upper class, and the airs of Master Zhao? Even if individual cadres have committed certain shortcomings, the situation may not be so serious! The root cause of these shortcomings should be seen as the result of being influenced by bourgeois ideology, and not as the result of implementing the wage system.

    不要否定工资制的历史意义
    吴毅
    读了10月13日人民日报第七版张春桥同志的“破除资产阶级的法权思想”一文后，颇有一点感觉。
    张春桥同志在文章的前半部分对我党在以往实行的供给制的评价是正确的。强调要以政治挂帅不要以钞票挂帅我更是完全拥护。但在文章中完全否定了工资制的历史意义以及将工资制度和“等级制度”混为一谈，是不够妥当的。
    首先，工资制不是我党素有的东西。在新中国成立后国家从国民党反动派手里接收过来的是经过长期战争破坏的穷摊子，多数企业还为私人资本家所有，当时为了稳定市场和支援解放军追歼残敌，需要迅速恢复生产，在这种情况下对接收过来的企业中的职工工资制度是维持原状好呢，还是改为供给制？当然是前者为好。九年来国家对于旧社会遗留下来的工资制度作了很多的改革，至于国家机关工作人员只是在1952年以后才逐渐由供给制改为工资制的。从解放到今天工业生产能有这样大的成绩，其中就有在党的领导下实行了以按劳付酬为标准的社会主义性质的工资制度的因素。尽管现行工资制度还存在缺点，需要不断改进，但不能否认它曾经起过的历史作用。今天它仍没有完全失去作为社会物质分配的一种形式。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中，对社会主义社会的分配原则曾写道：“我们这里所说的不是已经在自身基础上发展了的共产主义社会，而是刚刚从资本主义社会中产生出来，因此在各方面，即在经济、道德和智慧方面都还保留其所由脱胎出来的那个旧社会痕迹的共产主义社会。所以，每一个别的生产者，在作了各项扣除之后，从社会中正好领回他所给予社会的一切。”虽然马克思认为这种分配原则有缺点，但是他说“这些缺点，在共产主义社会第一阶段中，在它经过长久的产育苦痛以后刚刚从资本主义社会里产生出来的形态中，是不可避免的。法权永不能超过社会经济制度以及由此经济制度所决定的社会文化发展程度。”同时他进一步指出：“在共产主义社会高级阶段上，当那奴役人们、迫使其服从社会分工的情形已经消失后；……当劳动已经不单单是谋生的手段，而当本身已成为乐生的第一要素时，且生产力已随着每个人在各方面的发展而增高，一切公共财富源泉都尽量涌现出来时，——只有那时，才可把资产阶级式的法权的狭隘眼界完全克服，而社会就能在自己的旗帜上写着：各尽所能，各取所需！”（马恩文选两卷集第二卷21—23页）目前，在我国全面大跃进的形势下，工人农民掀起了冲天的干劲，生产量成倍地甚至几十倍的提高，计件工资制已不再起推动生产的作用，而起阻碍作用的时候，工人自动提出取消计件工资制改行计时工资制是完全正确的。这是我国工人阶级崇高的共产主义风格的具体表现。但不能由此就能说，以前实行的工资制是错了。现在就可以取消工资制。目前农村人民公社实行的半供给制半工资制的办法，基本上仍然是社会主义时期的一种按劳付酬制度，但是，又必须看到在这种半供给制半工资制的办法中已经包含着共产主义的萌芽。
    其次在文章中将工资制度与封建等级制度并列也有问题，我认为今天实行的工资制度根本不能与封建时代的等级制度相比拟。更不能认为实行了工资制度就是有了等级制度。也不能认为有些干部因为实行工资制而“迅速地学会了绅士派头、高等华人派头、赵太爷派头来了”，“见面不称什么什么‘长’就不舒服起来”；并且“刺激起了争名于朝、争利于市的积极性，刺激起了铺张浪费不以为耻反以为荣的积极性……”。问题不能这样理解。在哪里能看到有些干部迅速地学会了绅士派头、高等华人派头、赵太爷派头来了呢？纵然有个别干部犯有某些缺点，情况也未必如此严重！对于产生这些缺点的根源应该看成是受到资产阶级思想影响的结果，而不能看成是实行了工资制的结果。
