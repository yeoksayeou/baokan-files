Stepping into the grand gate of the Heping (Peace) People's Commune, a row of white walls covered in poetry immediately greets you. In large red characters it says: "Thousands Write Poetry, Ten Thousands Sing, A Village of Poetry with Bountiful Rice and Wheat." Below it says: "Compiled by the Baimao Township Literary Association." Here, new folk songs praising the People's Commune and Communism follow one after another, simply dazzling you. Look at this one which writes:

	Small-scale farming is a single-plank bridge,
	Cooperatives are a broad road,
	People's Communes are established,
	Heaven is not as good as the human world!

Another poem titled "East Wind Blows" contains a section like this:

	The East Wind has boundless power,
	Blowing away superstition at its roots,
	Sweeping away conservatism,
	Sinking backwardness to the bottom of the sea,
	Leaving no trace of poverty.

Huge banners spanning the streets are filled with poetry, the encouraging signs and responsibility signs in the fields are also filled with poetry, the explanatory texts in the exhibitions are poetry, and even the corridors and walls of the cafeterias and hostels are all covered in poetry. In the canteen of the First Brigade, a commune member named Jiang Haosheng wrote a poem like this:

	September chrysanthemums are yellow to the core,
	People's Communes are paradise,
	Joy in the heart, singing in the mouth,
	Folk songs fly over Baimao Pond.

No wonder there is so much poetry here, it turns out there are plenty of poets and singers. The Party Secretary of the commune, Wan Zuxiang, is an excellent folk singer. At the meeting of commune and brigade cadres to discuss the establishment of the commune, Wan Zuxiang first set up a folk song contest. He sang against everyone, singing a verse and then someone below responding with a verse. In one go, over fifty new folk songs praising the benefits of the People's Commune were improvised and sung at the meeting. Before the commune members' meetings in each brigade, folk songs are also sung. When commune members went by boat to participate in the registration meeting, songs were sung continuously along the way.

Zou Zhenmei, a member of the Township Literary Association, is seventy-three years old this year, with a snow-white beard reaching his chest, but his voice is loud when he sings folk songs. He has written many folk songs comparing the old and new societies. Now that the commune has been established, this old folk singer's heart is bursting with joy. Every day, he ponders new folk song verses while feeding the pigs. Recently, he wrote more than a dozen new folk songs on the theme of "Great Changes in Baimao Township," praising the grain supply system, the Homes of Happiness, kindergartens, and universal armament. One evening, I heard him sing several verses of his new work. One verse sang:

	Great changes in Baimao Township,
	Baimao Pond is dug like a canal,
	The houses on both sides are built in the same style,
	Gardens behind the houses and open spaces in front,
	Electric lights shine brightly everywhere.

Baimao Township, where the Heping People's Commune is located, belongs to Changshu County, Jiangsu Province. The great leap forward in agricultural production has ushered the ancient Baimao folk songs into a new era. In the past year, peasant poets and singers have written and sung 30,000 new folk songs with epochal significance. In early August, the Township Literary Association was established, and more than a hundred new members formed thirty creative groups, becoming the central force in the mass literary and artistic creation movement. Recently, the Township Literary Association launched a campaign of "Five Poems and One Letter Per Person" among the more than five thousand students who had just been freed from the label of illiteracy, forming a surge of everyone writing poetry and everyone singing.

    人人写诗个个唱
    新华社记者　古平
    走进和平人民公社高大的门楼，一排写满诗歌的白粉墙迎面扑来。大红字写着：千人诗，万人唱，稻麦丰收诗歌乡。下面写着：白茆乡文联编。在这里，歌颂人民公社，歌颂共产主义的新山歌一首接着一首，简直叫你目不暇接。你看那一首写的是：
    小农经济独木桥，
    合作社是康庄道，
    人民公社办起来，
    天堂哪有人间好！
    另一首题为“东风吹”诗歌中的一段是这样的：
    东风力量大无穷，
    吹得迷信连根拔，
    吹得保守一扫空，
    吹得落后沉海底，
    吹得贫穷影无踪。
    横穿街道的巨幅标语写的是诗，田间鼓动牌、责任牌上也写的是诗，展览会里的说明词是诗，连食堂、旅馆的走廊和墙壁上也全写满了诗。一大队食堂里有社员蒋浩生写的一首这样的诗：
    九月菊花透心黄，
    人民公社是天堂，
    心里喜，嘴里唱，
    山歌飞过白茆塘。
    怪不得这里的诗多，原来这里有的是诗人、歌手。社党委书记万祖祥就是一个出色的山歌手。在讨论成立公社的社、队干部大会上，万祖祥首先摆起了山歌擂台，他一个人和大家对唱，他唱一段，下面有人对一段，随编随唱，一下子在会上对唱出五十多首新山歌，都是唱的人民公社的好处。各大队的社员大会，在开会之前，也是先对唱山歌。社员们坐船去参加报名大会时，沿路更是歌声不断。
    乡文联会员邹振楣今年七十三岁了，雪白的胡须齐到胸口，但唱起山歌来声音洪亮。他曾经编过许多新旧社会对比的山歌。现在，公社成立了，这位老山歌手心花怒放。每天，他一面烧猪食，一面在心里琢磨着新的山歌句子。最近他以“白茆乡大变样”为题，编了十几首歌颂粮食供给制、歌颂幸福院、幼儿园和全民武装等新山歌。有天晚上，我听他唱了几段他的新作。有一段唱的是：
    白茆乡大变样，
    白茆塘开得像运河样，
    两岸房子造得一式样，
    屋后花园门前场，
    电灯照得满场亮。
    和平人民公社所在的白茆乡，属江苏省常熟县。农业生产的大跃进，使古老的白茆山歌进入了一个新时代。一年以来，农民诗人和歌手们，写出了唱出了三万首富有时代意义的新山歌。8月初，乡文联成立了，一百多个新会员组成了三十个创作小组，成为群众文艺创作运动的中心力量。最近，乡文联在全社五千多个刚刚摘去文盲帽子的学员中开展了一人五首诗一封信的运动，形成了人人写诗个个唱的热潮。
