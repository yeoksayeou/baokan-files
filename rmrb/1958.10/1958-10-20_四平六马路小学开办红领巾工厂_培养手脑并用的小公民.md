Siping Six Malu Primary School Opens Red Scarf Factory: Cultivating Little Citizens Who Use Both Hands and Brains

(Our dispatch) Reporter Wang Wenlian reports: The Six Malu Primary School in Siping City, Jilin Province, has established a Red Scarf Factory. Based on the different ages and physical conditions of the primary school students, it conducts diverse production labor in conjunction with teaching, and implements the communist principle of distribution for the income from work-study programs, thereby promoting the rapid growth of new moral qualities in primary school students.

The Six Malu Primary School's Red Scarf Factory was established in March of this year. It has eight workshops including nail-making, rake-making, brush-making, wire-flattening, electric welding, carpentry, welding rod-making, and a kiln, as well as a bathhouse, barbershop, and clinic. The Red Scarf Factory produces products such as nails, rakes, and *Malanjian* root brushes, which are diverse and interesting. All eight hundred and eighty-eight children over the age of nine in the school, according to their age, physical strength, and gender, take turns participating in labor twice a week according to the complexity and difficulty of the work: three to four hours a week for the third and fourth grades, and eight hours a week for the fifth and sixth grades. The third and fourth graders, aged nine to ten, mostly work in the wire-flattening workshop, using small hammers to ding and clang, flattening the crooked scrap iron wire, and supplying the nail-making workshop to make nails. The workers in the nail-making workshop are mostly fifth and sixth graders aged fourteen to sixteen. They use a press to cut nail points from the flat iron wire, and a nail-head machine to make nail heads, creating nails of various sizes. Female students with weaker physiques mostly wash *Malanjian* roots and tie scrubbing brushes in the brush-making workshop, or participate in service work, which requires less effort. The carpentry and kiln workshops are all male students, manufacturing tools and small machinery for use in the production of the various workshops. First and second graders, aged seven and eight, do not participate in labor, but do some light housekeeping within the school to the best of their ability. The young workers start with simple, light work, and gradually progress to more complex and difficult labor; after learning all the skills for one product, they go on to master another, so that they can become new people who use both hands and brains in elementary school.

The administrative management system of the Red Scarf Factory is the same as that of a general large factory. Except for the supply of raw materials and the sales of products, which are the responsibility of teachers, everything else is handled by the young workers themselves. The factory director, technicians, workshop directors, inspectors, custodians, production team leaders, etc. are all elected by the young workers themselves. Production plans, worker rules, operating procedures, and reward and punishment regulations are also formulated after collective discussions. Since the start of operations, the Red Scarf Factory has produced three thousand rakes, seven thousand *jin* of nails, and one thousand one hundred brushes of various kinds, with a total value of 5,400 yuan. After deducting costs, the total surplus is 3,500 yuan. Most of it is used to add equipment and expand reproduction, and part of it is used for collective welfare. Since August, the school has implemented free haircuts, baths, and medical care, and has also made more than forty sets of work clothes.

In labor, many new moral qualities are growing. Broken desks and chairs in the school are automatically repaired by the students; when it is windy and rainy, everyone takes care to close the windows to prevent damage to public property. Currently, out of the 1,224 students in the school, almost all, except for children who are overage or not old enough to join the Young Pioneers, wear red scarves.

Because students must closely connect each process in production and form a whole, the boundaries between male and female students and classes are opened up. Students care for each other and cherish the collective. Female students sew clothes and buttons for male students, and urge them to do their homework; male students volunteer to be sports coaches for female students, helping each other and improving together. On rainy days, older students escort younger students home, and cut each other's hair if it gets long, uniting like a family.

Students use the knowledge learned in the classroom in production, so that learning is consistent with application. Wang Furong and Dong Quan, sixth graders aged fourteen and fifteen, used the preliminary geometric knowledge of "angles" learned in arithmetic class when making nail-point cutting knives, and made knives with 45-degree angles. Third graders, aged nine to ten, can calculate the number of iron wires flattened by each person and the total number calculated by the whole class when flattening iron wires, and use scales to weigh them. Other students also use calculations such as fractions and weights and measures in production at any time to consolidate their learning results. Teachers also use the production figures of small factories to compile review questions. Students are most interested in calculating their own production problems, understand them quickly, and remember them deeply. Xie Baogui and Mou Qinghai, sixth graders, used the lever principle learned in natural science class to solve the problem that the wheel was stuck and could not be moved by hand. The young workers in the Red Scarf Factory who cut nail points, make nail heads, and tie scrubbing brushes have reached or approached the quotas of workers in Siping City's hardware factories and production cooperatives, and the quality has been identified as qualified. The "Leap Forward" barbershop attached to the small factory has several young barbers aged thirteen to sixteen, who have a very good service attitude and are constantly improving their skills. They can cut flat tops, parted hair, youth styles, peace styles, and airplane styles, and recently learned the women's basketball number five style, and can give free haircuts to twenty or thirty students every day.

Children gradually develop the persistence and patience to concentrate on their work in a certain period of time to complete their own determined production plans. In the past, 30% of the students in Class 4 of the sixth grade often did not have the patience to do their homework, their writing became more and more scribbled, and there were more mistakes. After half a year of labor training, 100% have achieved good results and have been praised by teachers. This year, all graduating students took the unified junior high school entrance examination. Among all the candidates in the city, there were five students whose total score was above 185 points. All five of these students were from Six Malu Primary School. Among the 97 top students with scores above 160 points, 40 were also from Six Malu Primary School.

Now the school has included labor classes in the curriculum and made it a system. (Attached pictures)

    四平六马路小学开办红领巾工厂
    培养手脑并用的小公民
    本报讯　记者王文琏报道：吉林省四平市六马路小学校开办红领巾工厂，根据小学生不同年龄与体质条件，结合教学进行多样化生产劳动，并对勤工俭学收入实行共产主义分配原则，因而促进小学生新的道德品质迅速成长。
    六马路小学的红领巾工厂是在今年3月建立起来的。共有制钉、制耙、扎刷、平丝、电焊、木工、制焊条、烘炉等八个车间和浴池、理发室、医务室。红领巾工厂生产钉子、耙子和马蔺根刷子等产品，多样有趣。全校八百八十八名九岁以上的儿童，按照他们年龄大小、体格强弱和性别不同，每周按工种、工序的繁简和难易轮流进行两次劳动：三、四年级每周共六小时，五、六年级每周八小时。三、四年级九岁至十岁的儿童大都在平丝车间，用小鎯头叮叮当当地敲平弯弯曲曲的废铁丝，供应制钉车间做钉子。制钉车间的工人大都是五、六年级十四到十六岁的学生。他们把平直的铁丝，用压力机切钉尖，打帽机打钉帽，做成一只只大大小小各种尺寸的钉子。身体较弱的女学生大都在扎刷车间洗马蔺根草和扎板刷，或参加服务性劳动，工作量较轻。木工和烘炉车间都是男学生，制造工具和小机械，供应各车间生产用。一、二年级七、八岁的学生不参加劳动，做些力所能及的校内勤务。小工人先从简单的、轻微的劳动做起，逐步进展到比较复杂、困难的劳动；学会一种产品的全部技能以后，再去掌握另一种，几年内就能学到许多种技能，使他们能在小学阶段里就成为手脑并用的新人。
    红领巾工厂的行政管理制度和一般大工厂一样，除原材料供应和产品销售由教师负责外，其他都由小工人自己担任。工厂厂长、技术员、车间主任、验收员、保管员、生产小组长等都是小工人自己推选的。生产计划、工人守则、操作规程、奖惩条例也是他们集体讨论后制订的。从开工到现在，红领巾工厂已出产耙子三千把，钉子七千斤，各种刷子一千一百把，价值共五千四百元，除去成本，共盈余三千五百元。大部分用于增添设备，扩大再生产，部分用于集体福利。从8月开始，学校实行了免费理发、洗澡、医疗，还做了四十多套工作服。
    在劳动中，许多新的道德品质正在成长。学校里的坏桌椅学生们自动修好了；刮风下雨时，大家注意关闭窗户，免得公物受损失。目前，全校一千二百二十四名学生中，除超龄或不够队龄的儿童以外，几乎全部戴上了红领巾。
    由于学生在生产中必须紧密衔接各道工序，结成整体，于是男女学生和班级之间的界限打开了。学生们互相关心，爱护集体。女学生给男学生缝衣钉扣，督促做作业；男学生自告奋勇地给女学生当体育教练，相互帮助，共同提高。雨天，大班学生护送小班学生回家，头发长了互相修剪，团结得像一家人。
    学生们在劳动中把课堂学习的知识用到生产中，使学用一致。六年级十四、五岁的学生王福荣和董权做切钉尖刀时，应用了算术课里学到的几何初步知识“角”，做成了四十五度角的刀子。三年级九岁至十岁的小学生，在平铁丝时，会计算每人平出的根数和全班合计的总数，并用称秤重量。其余学生也都在生产中，随时运用分数和度量衡等计算知识，巩固学习成果。教师也用小工厂的生产数字编写复习题。学生们对计算自己的生产题目最感兴趣，理解得快，记忆得深。六年级学生谢宝贵、牟庆海，应用自然课中学到的杠杆原理，解决了转轮卡住人手扳不动的故障。红领巾工厂里的小工人切钉尖、打钉帽、扎板刷，已达到或接近四平市五金工厂和生产合作社工人的定额，质量经过鉴定也都合格。小工厂附设的“跃进”理发社里有几名十三岁至十六岁的小理发师，服务态度很好，技术也在不断提高，她们会剪平头、分头、青年式、和平式、飞机式，最近又学会了女篮五号式，每天可给二、三十名同学免费理发。
    儿童们在一定时间内完成自己确定的生产计划中，逐渐养成集中精力工作的持久性和耐力。六年级四班过去经常有30％的学生没有耐心做作业，字越写越潦草，错误也更多。经过半年劳动锻炼，已经百分之百达到良好，受到老师称赞。今年暑期毕业生统一投考初中，在全市考生中，成绩总分在一百八十五分以上的共有五名，这五名全是六马路小学的学生。在一百六十分以上的九十七名优等生中，有四十名也是六马路小学的。
    现在这个学校已把劳动课列入课程表，成为制度。（附图片）
