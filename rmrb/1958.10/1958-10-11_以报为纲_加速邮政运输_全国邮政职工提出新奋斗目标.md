Xinhua News Agency report: Taking newspapers as the key link, accelerating postal transportation speed, and striving to realize the delivery of central newspapers to provinces on the same day, provincial newspapers to counties on the same day, and county newspapers to communes on the same day. This is the new task proposed by the National Provincial Postal Transportation Work Conference.

This conference was hosted by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and held in Chengdu from September 22nd to 28th. More than sixty representatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, based on the new situation of the general line of socialist construction and the leap forward development of socialist construction, focused on studying the issue of taking newspapers as the key link to accelerate postal transportation speed, and exchanged advanced experiences in postal transportation work.

The conference believes that the practice of various regions following the mass line, adopting a combination of self-management and entrusted management, and combining indigenous and foreign methods for postal transportation tools is very good. It has brought into play the enthusiasm of the masses in running postal transportation undertakings, ensuring that postal transportation departments concentrate their efforts on some modern tools, thus accelerating postal transportation speed. Before the Great Leap Forward, only Guangdong Province and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had intra-provincial (regional) airmail routes, but now Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Anhui, Shanxi, Shandong and other provinces and regions have added intra-provincial airmail routes. Many provinces and regions have also established and operated their own postal motor vehicle routes. Although traffic conditions in Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi and other provinces are quite difficult, due to the self-operated motor vehicle routes and the implementation of day and night transportation, the number of counties and cities seeing provincial newspapers on the same day has greatly increased.

The conference put forward leap forward plans and measures, requiring that the backwardness of postal transportation work in some areas be changed in a very short period of time.

    以报为纲　加速邮政运输
    全国邮政职工提出新奋斗目标
    据新华社讯　以报为纲，加快邮运速度，为实现中央报纸当天到省、省报当天到县，县报当天到公社而奋斗。这是全国省内邮政运输工作会议提出的新任务。
    这次会议由邮电部主持，于9月22日至28日在成都举行。参加会议的各省、市、自治区的六十多个代表，根据社会主义建设总路线和社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的新形势，着重研究了以报为纲，加快邮运速度的问题，交流了邮运工作的先进经验。
    会议认为，各地走群众路线，采取自办与委托办理相结合，邮运工具的土洋结合等做法很好，发挥了群众办邮运事业的积极性，保证邮运部门集中力量搞一些现代化的工具，使邮运速度加快了。大跃进前，仅广东省和新疆维吾尔自治区有省（区）内航空邮路，而现在四川、云南、广西、安徽、山西、山东等省、区都增设了省内航空邮路。许多省、区还自己增辟和兴办了邮政汽车邮路。四川、云南、陕西等省虽然交通条件相当困难，但由于自办了汽车邮路，实行昼夜兼程运输，使当天看到省报的县、市大大增多。
    会议提出了跃进的计划和措施，要求在很短期间改变有些地区邮运工作仍然落后的面貌。
