Gift from the Light Industry Design Institute
People's Commune Comprehensive Factory

To meet the needs of people's communes in establishing various factories, the Light Industry Design Institute has designed a comprehensive small factory based on materials such as ceramics, bricks, wood, and cement, with paper making as the main focus.

This small comprehensive factory includes sections for pulping and papermaking, brewing, feed production, electrolytic salt production, and a lime kiln. The design utilizes several common raw materials that are easily available locally, such as rice straw, salt, limestone, and coal. These raw materials can be used to produce products such as paper, alcohol, feed, caustic soda, bleaching powder, and lime. The factory adopts a method of comprehensive utilization in stages. For example, rice straw is first used for fermentation to produce alcohol. After brewing, the residue is sieved, with the fine residue used as feed and the coarse residue used for pulping and papermaking. At the same time, considering the need for chemical raw materials in the paper mill, equipment for electrolytic salt production and a lime kiln is also attached, so as to produce caustic soda and chlorine gas. Using chlorine gas and lime, bleaching powder can also be produced.

This small factory can produce 150 tons of glazed paper, wrapping paper, sanitary paper, various colored posters, and match paper annually, as well as 90 tons of 46-proof white spirit; 300 tons of feed, 630 tons of distiller's grains, and 135 tons of liquid caustic soda; 98 tons of bleaching powder, and 350 tons of quicklime. In addition to the factory's own use, it can also sell 30 tons of caustic soda, 80 tons of bleaching powder, and 270 tons of slaked lime annually.

The entire factory requires approximately 1,100 tons of rice straw, 75 tons of salt, 634 tons of limestone, and 359 tons of coal annually as main raw materials.

The entire factory requires a total of 56 employees. The total investment required is more than 54,000 yuan, and the entire investment can be recovered in approximately five and a half months.

    轻工业设计院的礼物
    人民公社综合工厂
    轻工业部设计院为了适应人民公社兴办各种工厂的需要，以陶瓷、砖、木、水泥等材料设计了以造纸为主的综合性小型工厂。
    这个小型综合工厂有制浆造纸、酿酒、制饲料、电解食盐及石灰窑几个部分。这个设计是采用几种易于就地取材的普通原料，如稻草、食盐、石灰石和煤。用这些原料就可以生产出纸、酒、饲料、烧碱、漂粉和石灰等产品。这种工厂的生产是采用分次综合利用的办法，例如稻草，先用来发酵酿酒，酿酒后的酒糟过筛后，细糟作饲料，粗糟再制浆造纸。同时考虑纸厂需用化工原料，并附设有电解食盐及石灰窑的设备，以便生产烧碱、氯气，利用氯气和石灰，又可以生产漂粉。
    这个小工厂每年能生产有光纸、包装纸、卫生纸、各色招贴纸、火柴纸等一百五十吨，四十六度白酒九十吨；饲料三百吨，酒糟六百三十吨，液体烧碱一百三十五吨；漂粉九十八吨，生石灰三百五十吨。除工厂自用以外，每年还能出售烧碱三十吨，漂粉八十吨，熟石灰二百七十吨。
    全厂每年共需各种主要原料，稻草约一千一百吨，食盐七十五吨，石灰石六百三十四吨，煤三百五十九吨。
    全厂共需职工五十六人。共需投资五万四千多元，约计五个半月即可全部收回投资。
