    Yi Ethnic Old Woman Paints the Harvest
    Yi Ethnic Group, Pu Fei
    A supply and marketing cooperative cadre, delivering goods to the fields, finished selling his wares and was returning with empty baskets. Suddenly, a burst of hearty laughter erupted behind him. He turned around and saw that the laughter came from an old woman – she was Granny Shi, a seventy-three-year-old from this village. The cadre was about to ask her what she was laughing at, but she said with a smile, "Quick, quick, quick, sell me a large sheet of white paper!"
    The supply and marketing cooperative cadre said, "Someone just asked me to save a large sheet of white paper. Was that you?"
    "Yes, it was me! The rice stalks are so tall that you can't see me when I stand in the field, ah haha, quick, get it to me, I'm afraid you'll be delayed, so I came myself."
    "The autumn harvest is so busy, isn't that delaying you?"
    "I carried a bag of grain behind you, and you didn't even know. I carried the grain to the threshing ground and dumped it, then caught up with you – I'm not delayed at all."
    The supply and marketing cooperative cadre then asked, "This year the grain is being hauled by horses and oxen, to eliminate people carrying it on their backs, but you..."
    Before he could finish, she interrupted, "Consider it a criticism, I haven't carried it before, this time it was to carry a bag along the way to get paper, I won't carry it again, quickly, quickly!"
    The cadre hurriedly opened the door of the supply and marketing cooperative and gave her a large sheet of glossy paper. He thought: what is this old woman going to do with a sheet of white paper during the busy harvest season? He looked at her face with surprise. The old woman misunderstood, thinking he was looking at her hat, so she said, "We Yi people also bought a Han Chinese hat. My hair is shaved. Shaving hair to collect fertilizer, to eliminate the three types of weak seedlings, now the three types of weak seedlings are growing tall, catching up with the first type of good seedlings, the ears of grain are about to turn yellow." With that, she hurried out.
    The fields are like a golden ocean, red flags are fluttering, and under each red flag is a group of people harvesting. The rice stalks obscure them. There are many low thatched huts made of ripe rice stalks along the edge of the field. Granny Shi walked towards one of them. Granny Shi returned to her small hut, busily took out eight-colored paints from her little grandson's schoolbag, spread out the paper, and used the skills she had when she was young to draw flowers and patterns, drawing a winding dam on the paper, then drawing straight and lush rice stalks, and then drawing many threshing machines, scattered about. At this point, the gong rang for work, and she had to put down her pen and rush to the field. Granny Shi vigorously cut the rice, and while cutting, she would occasionally look at the rotating threshing machine, feeling that what she had drawn was too dissimilar.
    The sun set to the west, and the team members went to the meal area for dinner. Granny Shi went back to her thatched hut. Her sheet of paper was still piled on the low table. Looking closely, ah! Eight new flags were painted on the paper, dyed red with watercolors. She thought to herself, "This must be added by my little grandson. What I drew is very unlike the real thing, but how did he guess that I was painting the harvest?" Then she carefully modified the threshing machine, but the more she modified it, the less it looked like the real thing, so she had to leave it as it was. Then she drew a road, with horse-drawn carts on the road.
    "Dong, dong, dong!" The gong rang for night work, and then she remembered that she hadn't had dinner yet! She hastily added a piece of clothing and walked towards the field.
    Everyone moved the threshing machine to another plot of land, and Granny Shi also crowded into the crowd to push the cart.
    "You go back, we're going to work until dawn."
    "I want to work until dawn too!" Although she said so, she was thinking about it. The moon has been shining brightly these past few nights, and the commune members are harvesting by moonlight. None of the groups light lamps. This stumped her. No matter how wide she opened her eyes, she could only see a hazy patch.
    The team leader said, "It doesn't matter if you don't come, it doesn't matter if you're late, why do you have to be so busy?"
    Afraid of groping her way, she didn't say anything more and staggered home.
    The grayish-white kerosene lamp lit up in the thatched hut. Granny Shi sat at the low table and continued to paint her picture. Ah, she discovered that someone else had added to the painting. It was a group of cattle, carrying bags of grain, walking in a line along the road. Judging from the handwriting, it wasn't added by her little grandson, it must be her daughter-in-law. When did she come back? She felt that others had messed up her harvest picture, but she also felt that it was more perfect than what she had drawn. Yes, these should be painted. Aren't red flags flying in the fields? Doesn't the ox-cart team often come to carry grain? The scenes she saw during the day floated into her mind: golden ears forming a sea, red flags everywhere, threshing machines and songs everywhere; on the roads, oxen, horses, and carts are constantly coming and going. Ah, I also need to draw a river, with boats in the river, and boats piled with grain…
    She pondered and laughed from her heart; she thought: This is an unprecedented great harvest, I must paint it! Her heart was beating, her hand was trembling, she painted this, missed that, yes, this year's great harvest can't be painted completely!
    Finally, she dipped in ink and wrote five words tremblingly: This Year's Grain.
    She hurriedly hung the painting on the grass wall next to the portrait of Chairman Mao, climbed into bed, and fell into a sweet sleep. (Mark Illustration)

    彝族老太画丰收
    彝族　普飞
    一个送货到田间去的供销社干部，卖完了货品，挑着空担子回来。忽然，他背后发出一阵爽朗的笑声，他转过头去，看见笑的是一位老太太——她是本寨七十三岁的施老太太。那干部刚想问她笑什么，她却笑着说：“快，快，快，卖一张大白纸给我！”
    供销社干部说：“刚才有人说要我留一张大白纸，是你吗？”
    “是呀，就是我！稻棵长得那么高，我站在田里你就望不见我了，啊哈哈，快，快拿给我，我怕你耽搁，所以自己赶来了。”
    “秋收这么紧张，那不是耽搁了你？”
    “我扛着一袋谷子跟在你后面走，你一点都不知道，把谷子背到晒场上倒了，又追上了你——我可没耽搁呀。”
    供销社干部又问：“今年这谷子都用马拉牛驮，要消灭人挑人背，你却……”
    不等人家说完，她便插嘴道：“算是挨了批评啦，以前没扛过，这次是为了拿纸顺便扛一袋的，以后不扛了，快快！”
    那干部急忙开了供销社的门，拿了一大张油光纸给她，他想：这老太太大忙天买张白纸作什么？他惊奇地望着她的脸，老太太可误会了，认为他是望她的帽子，便说：“我们彝人也买了顶汉人帽子。我的头发剃了嘛。剃头发凑肥料，消灭三类苗，如今三类苗长得高高的，赶上了一类苗，谷穗快黄啦。”说罢，匆匆出去了。
    田野，像一片金色的海洋，红旗招展，每杆红旗下面，都有一伙人在收割，只因稻棵把他们遮没了，田边有许多间用熟禾秆盖成的低矮的草屋。施老太太朝其中的一间走去。施老太太回到自己的小屋，忙从小孙子的书包里，拿出了八彩颜色，铺开了纸，使出了年青时描花画样的本领，在纸上画了一个弯弯的坝子，再画上又直又旺的稻棵，然后画上许多打谷机，七零八落地分布着。画到这里，接工的锣声响了，她只好放下笔，忙跑到田里去。施老太太使劲割着谷子，一面割一面不时看看旋转着的打谷机，觉得自己画的太不像了。
    太阳偏西，组员们到饭场上开饭，施老太太呢，回她的草屋去了。她的那张纸照旧堆在矮桌上，定睛一看，呵！纸上新画了八面旗帜，用水彩染得红红的。她暗暗地想：“这分明是小孙子添的，我画的很不像，可是他怎么猜出来是画丰收呢？”然后细心地修改打谷机，但是越改越不像，只好不改了。接着就画了一条道路，路上有马车。
    “当，当，当！”出夜工的锣声响了，这时她才想起还没有吃晚饭哪！她慌里慌张地加了一件衣裳，向田里走去。
    大家把打谷机移到另一丘田里，施老太太也拥进人群里去推车。
    “你回去吧，我们要干到天亮。”
    “我也要干到天亮！”她嘴上虽这么说，但脑子里可考虑起来了。近几夜月亮照得亮堂堂，社员们借着月光收割，无论哪一组都不点灯。这可难住了她，眼睛不论睁得多大，却只能看见迷迷糊糊的一片。
    组长说，“你嘛，不来也不要紧，迟到也不要紧，为什么偏偏要忙成这样呢？”
    她怕摸路，便没有再说话踉踉跄跄地往家走去。
    白灰灰的煤油灯，在草屋里亮起来了。施老太太坐在矮桌前，继续画她的图画，啊，她发现画上又被人添了一些，这是一群牛，驮着一袋袋的谷子，在道路旁走成一行。看笔迹，不是小孙子添的，那一定是媳妇了，她什么时候回来过呢？她觉得别人画乱了她的丰收图，但又觉得比她画的完美，对的，应该把这些画上，田野上不是飘着红旗吗？驮牛队不是常常来驮谷子吗？她在白天看见的景象浮到脑海里来了：金穗成海，到处是红旗，到处是打谷机和歌声；道路上，牛、马车络绎不绝。呵，还要画上一条江，江中有船，船上堆着谷子。……
    她沉思着，从心里发出了笑声；她想：这是从来未有过的大丰收呢，我一定要画！她的心跳动着，手哆嗦着，画上了这样，漏了那样，是啊，今年的大丰收画不完呵！
    最后，她蘸了墨，哆哆嗦嗦地写上了五个字：今年的谷子。
    她急忙把画挂在草壁上毛主席的像旁边，爬上床甜甜地睡着了。（马　克插图）
