Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 25th. "Al-Jamahir" newspaper's president, Bashir Qardan, said in a commentary on the 24th that Dulles's recent speech in Taipei, in which he stubbornly claimed that the communist system on mainland China would "disappear," was a ridiculous "Dulles logic."

The commentary said: "Dulles is simply talking nonsense. His words ridiculed Chiang Kai-shek and also ridiculed himself," because facts should be measured by results and the historical development of these results.

The author wrote: "I am not a communist, but I believe that the whole world is moving towards socialism in different forms." He also pointed out that the socialist camp is advancing from one victory to another, while on the other hand, the imperialist bloc is weakening.

    大马士革报纸评论说
    杜勒斯讥笑了自己
    新华社大马士革25日电　“群众报”社长巴希尔·卡丹24日在一篇评论中说，杜勒斯日前在台北讲话时硬说中国大陆上的共产主义制度会“消逝”，这是一种可笑的“杜勒斯逻辑”。
    评论说：“杜勒斯简直是不知所云，他的话讥笑了蒋介石，同时也讥笑了他自己”，因为事实是要以结果和这些结果在历史上的发展来衡量的。
    作者写道：“我不是共产党人，但是我相信，整个世界正在以不同的形式向着社会主义迈进。”他还指出，社会主义阵营正在从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，而另一方面，帝国主义集团却在削弱。
