    The Sleepless Mountain City - Chongqing
    By our reporter Xu Yidao

    Late at night, the streets of Chongqing are quiet, but shops, restaurants, vegetable markets, long-distance bus and ship ticket offices, tram stations, and ferry terminals are all displaying eye-catching "Open All Night," "Night Service," and "Day and Night Sales" red lanterns. The Great Leap Forward has transformed the mountain city of Chongqing into a sleepless city.

    Many factories, mines, and loading stations have implemented a round-the-clock, three-shift system. Many basic construction sites are brightly lit all night long. Workers are busy day and night studying technology, installing machinery, and engaging in technical revolution, often rushing to stores late at night to purchase machine parts, accessories, and various raw materials. This has brought new tasks to commercial employees. Stores selling traffic, electrical, and chemical materials, as well as medicine, have generally implemented night shifts. One night at eleven o'clock, the Chongqing Machine Factory still lacked a regulating transformer for the machinery being installed. The workers called the Chongqing Electrical Equipment Store. The store clerk immediately delivered the equipment to the factory, more than ten kilometers away, ensuring that the factory's machinery could be put into production on time. A truck from the Sichuan Weiyuan Coal Mine broke down in Chongqing. It was night at the time, but thanks to the timely supply of auto parts from the Chongqing Transportation Equipment Store, the truck returned to Weiyuan ahead of schedule the next day.

    Many small restaurants and the Dayanggou vegetable market, located close to the docks and factories, are now open all night. They specialize in providing night meals for workers on night shifts and dockworkers. They are busy preparing various noodles, sweets, and seasonings during the day. As soon as workers step into the store late at night, the waiters serve hot noodles and dishes. Employees of the post office and telecommunications bureau are particularly busy at night, and nearby small restaurants often deliver night meals to them.

    The bumper harvest in industrial and agricultural production and the unprecedented prosperity of material exchange between urban and rural areas mean that many transport vehicles need to cross the river overnight, and many people need to rush into the city to buy things late at night. Starting on August 11, two important car ferry routes, Chqimen to Haitangxi and Jindu Estuary to Shimen, began operating around the clock. Vehicles and passengers can pass smoothly without hindrance. The Chaotianmen Wharf, located next to Guojielou, to Jinqyangmen in the Jiangbei District and Yemaoxi in the Nan'an District, two ferry routes, have also implemented 24-hour service. This connects the trams and ferries, making it convenient for many workers going to and from night shifts, passengers crossing the river, and customers entering the city to buy goods.

    不眠的山城——重庆
    本报记者  徐宜道
    深夜，重庆街头一片寂静，可是商店、饮食店、菜市场和长途汽车和轮船售票处、电车站和轮渡码头，到处挂着惹人注目的“通宵营业”、“夜间营业”、“日夜售货”的大红灯，生产大跃进把山城重庆变成了一座不眠的城市。
    许多厂矿企业、搬运站都实行了日夜三班制。不少基本建设工地通宵灯火辉煌。职工们日夜都在忙着钻研技术、安装机器，大搞技术革命，常常在深夜赶到商店采办机器零件、配件和各类原材料。这给商业职工带来了新的任务，交通电工器材、化工原料、医药等商店，普遍实行了夜间值班营业。有一天夜间十一点钟，重庆机器厂安装的机器还缺少一部调整变压器，职工们打电话告诉重庆电工器材商店。商店售货员马上把器材送到十多公里以外的工厂里，使这个厂的机器准时投入生产。四川威远煤矿的一辆卡车到重庆抛锚了，当时正是夜晚，但由于重庆交通器材商店及时供应了汽车零件，第二天卡车提前赶回威远。
    紧靠码头和工厂的许多小食店和大阳沟菜市场，现在都实行通宵营业。他们专门供应值夜班的职工和码头工人的夜餐。他们在白天就忙着准备好各种面食、甜食和各类调味品，职工们在深夜一跨进店门，服务员就把热腾腾的面、菜端上来了。邮局和电信局的职工夜间工作特别忙碌，附近的小食店常常给他们送夜餐。
    工农业生产的大丰收，城乡物资交流空前繁荣，许多运输车辆需要连夜过江，许多人要在深夜赶到城里买东西。8月11日开始，储奇门至海棠溪，巾渡口至石门的两条重要的车渡航线开始通宵行驶。车辆和旅客都可以畅通无阻。紧靠过街楼的朝天门码头到江北区觐阳门、南岸区野猫溪两条轮渡航线，也实行了通宵营业。这样，把电车与轮渡联结起来，使许多上下夜班职工、过江旅客和进城买货的顾客都感到方便。（附图片）
