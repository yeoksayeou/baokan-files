    Popularizing Culture Among the Masses
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Currently, the broad masses of working people across the country are bursting with enthusiasm and have launched a magnificent upsurge of great leaps forward in production. If the working people are to improve production, they must master scientific and technological knowledge. When they achieve success in their labor, they are happy to sing about the superiority of the socialist system and the heroic image of the workers. All of this promotes the development of cultural life, and their demands for culture are becoming increasingly urgent.

    Since the emergence of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward situation throughout the country, the working people have not only demonstrated tremendous talent in production but have also shown infinite wisdom in culture. They write poetry, paint pictures, write articles, and vigorously develop cultural undertakings. It is truly a scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a riot of color. In a very short period, mass cultural and artistic activities have flourished unprecedentedly. At present, mass amateur cultural and artistic organizations centered on clubs have spread throughout urban and rural areas, and privately run libraries and bookstores are countless in various places. For example, Anhui Province already has 1,993 privately run cultural centers, 87,828 rural clubs, 14,969 amateur theatrical troupes, and 31,136 mass creation groups. As for song and dance teams and literary and art propaganda teams, their numbers are even greater. New scenes of poetry and paintings covering walls and songs filling the land have appeared in both rural and urban areas. There is a saying among the working people: "Double harvest of production and culture, smiles on the eyebrows and joy in the heart." The most beautiful pictures have been painted by the hands of the working people, and the best poems have been sung from the mouths of the working people. Facts have proved that the rich life and struggle practice of the working people is an inexhaustible source of culture. Only the working people can create miracles in culture. Only the working people are the basic force for building a new national culture of socialism.

    However, the achievements made by the working people in culture are only the beginning of their cultural revolution, far from meeting the needs of the broad masses. In order to make cultural work more effectively serve socialist politics and economy, the task before us is to effectively promote cultural work further and realize the great popularization of culture.

    The realization of the great popularization of culture is a cultural emancipation movement of all working people, and it is a matter for the masses themselves, so it must be done by the masses themselves. The working people have a high enthusiasm for running cultural undertakings, and their potential is also infinite. The residents of Zhujiawan Zhongshan New Village and Fuxinli in Putuo District, Shanghai, worked hard for two days and nights to establish clubs, elementary schools, and libraries. These cultural undertakings were all established by the residents themselves donating materials and labor based on the principle of diligence and thrift. Their club uses the office of the residents' committee, and the library was established by the residents themselves contributing more than 2,000 books. Those with cultural knowledge automatically participated in the work of preparing for the school. Does not this example illustrate a point very well? If we rely on a few experts to run culture, is it possible to imagine such achievements? Therefore, only by firmly relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and forming a nationwide upsurge of all trades running culture, all levels running culture, and the whole people running culture, and using various forces to vigorously develop cultural undertakings, can we quickly realize the great popularization of cultural activities throughout the country, thereby gradually improving on the basis of popularization, and enabling our cultural undertakings to present a new atmosphere of a hundred flowers blooming and a garden full of spring.

    Cultural popularization work and mass cultural work must closely serve the central tasks of the local area at the time, serve production, and achieve "whatever the center needs, culture does," and "where production is, culture goes." Culture is the superstructure, and it should reflect the base and serve the base. Socialist culture must reflect socialist politics and economy and promote the development of socialist politics and economy. The so-called culture for culture's sake, art for art's sake, culture and art not serving the politics and economy of the proletariat, objectively will inevitably serve the politics and economy of the bourgeoisie and serve a few exploiters. This kind of culture has no mass base in our society and therefore cannot be developed. We must adhere to the方針 of culture serving politics and serving production because only in this way can cultural undertakings get the fertile soil of a great harvest.

    To mobilize the masses to run cultural undertakings, to make cultural undertakings serve politics and serve production, and to make culture greatly develop and greatly popularize, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and put politics in command. The vigorous development of the technological revolution requires the cultural revolution to keep up quickly, and the cultural revolution in turn promotes the technological revolution and the development of production. The two promote each other and develop each other. We must see the unity and consistency between the two; do not only see some contradictions between culture and production and ignore the popularization and development of cultural activities.

    The realization of the great popularization of culture, cultural and artistic workers have an important task in this revolution. A large number of cultural and artistic workers go to the countryside, factories, and companies, delve into the masses, and delve into life to popularize cultural activities, which is welcomed by the people. However, there are also some people who are unwilling to engage in popularization, unwilling to go deep into the reality of production, and go deep into the working masses. This is a reflection of bourgeois literary and artistic thought and cultural detachment from the masses. This kind of thought must be thoroughly criticized. We hope that the broad masses of cultural and artistic workers will hold high the red flag, delve into the masses, first learn from the masses, obtain nourishment from real life; then assist the masses, so that the wisdom and creativity of the masses can be fully exerted. Then concentrate it and improve it.

    Let our whole Party and the whole people act together to launch a mass movement for the great popularization of culture, so that splendid cultural flowers will bloom everywhere on the production and labor front of the motherland!

    把文化普及到群众中去
    本报评论员
    现在全国广大劳动人民干劲冲天，掀起了波澜壮阔的生产大跃进热潮。劳动人民要提高生产，就得掌握科学技术知识；他们在劳动得到了成就的时候，就心情愉快地想歌唱这优越的社会制度，歌唱劳动者的英雄形象，所有这些，都推动着文化生活的发展，他们对文化的要求越来越迫切。
    自从全国出现全面大跃进形势以来，劳动人民不仅在生产上表现了巨大的才能，在文化上也同样表现了无穷无尽的智慧。他们写诗、画画，作文章、大办文化事业，真是百花齐放，万紫千红。在很短时间内，群众文化艺术活动就空前繁荣起来。目前以俱乐部为中心的群众业余文化艺术组织已经遍布城乡，而民办图书馆、民办书店在各地更是不计其数。像安徽省已有民办文化馆一千九百九十三个，农村俱乐部八万七千八百二十八个，业余剧团一万四千九百六十九个，群众创作组三万一千一百三十六个，至于歌舞队、文艺宣传队为数更多。广大农村和城市都出现了诗画满墙、歌声遍地的新景象，在劳动人民中有这样一句话：“生产文化双丰收，笑在眉头喜心头”。在劳动人民的手下，画出了最美的图画，在劳动人民的口中，唱出了最好的诗歌。事实证明，劳动人民丰富的生活和斗争实践，就是取之不尽、用之不竭的文化泉源。只有劳动人民，才能在文化上创造出奇迹来。只有劳动人民，才是建设社会主义的民族的新文化的基本力量。
    但是，目前劳动人民在文化上取得的成就，仅仅是他们实现文化革命的一个开始，还远远不能满足广大群众的需要。为了使文化工作更有效地为社会主义的政治、经济服务，摆在我们面前的任务是，切实地把文化工作推进一步，实现文化大普及。
    实现文化大普及，是全体劳动人民的文化翻身运动，是群众自己的事情，因此也就必须由群众自己来办。劳动人民办文化事业的积极性是很高的，潜力也是无穷的。上海普陀区朱家湾中山新村和福新里的居民们，苦战两天两夜，就成立了俱乐部、小学和图书馆。这些文化事业都是根据勤俭办事业的原则，由居民们自动赠物出力办起来的。他们的俱乐部用的是居民委员会的办公室，图书馆是由居民们自己拿出二千多本书成立的，有文化水平的就自动参加了筹办学校的工作。众人拾柴火焰高，难道这不是一个很能说明问题的事例吗？如果依靠少数专家办文化，难道可能设想会出现这样的成绩吗？因此，只有坚定不移地依靠群众，发动群众，在全国范围内形成行行办文化，各级办文化，全民办文化的热潮，运用各种各样的力量来大办文化事业，才能很快地在全国实现文化活动的大普及，从而在普及的基础上逐步提高，才能使我们的文化事业上出现一种百花争艳、春色满园的新气象。
    文化普及工作和群众文化工作，必须紧密地为当地当时的中心任务服务，为生产服务，要做到“中心要啥，文化搞啥”、“生产在哪里，文化到哪里”。文化是上层建筑，它应该反映基础，并且为基础服务。社会主义的文化必须反映社会主义的政治和经济并促进社会主义的政治和经济发展。所谓为文化而文化，为艺术而艺术，文化艺术不为无产阶级的政治和经济服务，客观上就必然是为资产阶级的政治、经济服务，为少数剥削者服务。这种文化，在我们的社会里没有群众基础，因此也不可能得到发展。我们必须坚持文化为政治服务、为生产服务的方针，因为只有这样，才能使文化事业得到大丰收的肥沃土壤。
    要发动群众来办文化事业，要使文化事业为政治服务，为生产服务，使文化大发展，大普及，就必须加强党的领导，政治挂帅。技术革命蓬勃发展，要求文化革命迅速跟上，文化革命又推动了技术革命和生产的发展。这两者互相推动，互相发展。我们要看到这两者之间的统一性一致性；不要只看到文化和生产的某些矛盾，而忽略了文化活动的普及和发展。
    实现文化大普及，文化艺术工作者在这个革命中负有重要的任务。大批文化艺术工作者下乡、下厂、下连队，深入群众、深入生活，来普及文化活动，受到人民群众的欢迎。但是，也有一些人不愿搞普及，不愿深入生产实际，深入劳动群众。这是资产阶级文艺思想，文化脱离群众的反映。这种思想必须彻底批判。我们希望广大文化艺术工作者，都高举红旗，深入群众，先向群众学习，从现实生活中取得养料；再辅导群众，使群众的智慧和创造得到充分发挥。然后集中起来，加以提高。
    让我们全党全民齐动手，掀起一个全民的文化大普及运动，使祖国生产劳动战线上处处开出灿烂的文化花朵！
