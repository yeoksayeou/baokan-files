Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Central Government Departments' Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference was held in Beijing from October 12th to 14th. Vice Chairman Zhu De met with all the activists participating in the conference on the afternoon of the 14th and delivered a speech at the conference, giving important instructions on the tasks of young people across the country during the Great Leap Forward.

After analyzing the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country in his speech, Vice Chairman Zhu said: Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, the task of young people across the country, especially young activists, is to play a shock role in the great cause of building socialism and preparing to gradually transition to communism.

Vice Chairman Zhu encouraged the youth by saying: The characteristic of young people is that they are less bound by all stale things and stale ideas than the average adults and elderly people. They more easily accept new things and new ideas, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, have high enthusiasm and full vigor. Therefore, young people should and can play a shock role in the current great cause of socialist construction. As the ancient saying goes: "Like stacking firewood, those who come later surpass those who came before."

However, for young people to play a shock role, it must be conditional on being led by the advanced adults and elderly people of the proletariat who have been tempered in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party. Young people must learn from the revolutionary predecessors, learn from the workers and peasants, and should also learn critically from other adults and elderly people, learning everything useful from them and inheriting all the excellent achievements in human development. Refusing to learn, being arrogant and conceited, is bound to lead to no progress. At the same time, you should "surpass your predecessors," surpass them, and in turn, promote the progress of adults and elderly people.

Vice Chairman Zhu also instructed the youth to continuously carry out self-transformation, promote proletarian ideology, eliminate bourgeois ideology, and continue to complete the tasks of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. To this end, young people must actively implement the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on participating in physical labor, so that mental labor is combined with physical labor, intellectuals are integrated with workers and peasants, learning from the workers and peasants in labor, and helping the workers and peasants improve their technical and cultural levels. Vice Chairman Zhu said that this is not only an important measure for government employees to closely connect with the masses, but also an important measure to cultivate new people of the communist era.

Vice Chairman Zhu called on young people to especially go to the Northwest and Inner Mongolia and other regions to accelerate the construction of the frontier of the motherland, and show their talents in the great socialist construction there. Vice Chairman Zhu said: These regions account for 50% to 60% of the country's land area, and the above-ground and underground resources are extremely rich. They are the largest treasure of the motherland, but the population of these regions only accounts for about 6% of the country's population. In order to build a happy new China of socialism and communism, the vast number of young people across the country, including government youth, must go to these regions, quickly develop the resources of these regions, and build these regions into the beautiful gardens of the motherland.

Vice Chairman Zhu called on government youth to also run industries, agriculture, Red and Expert schools, and participate in militia organizations. Currently, in particular, they must participate in the nationwide steel battle. Vice Chairman Zhu said: You must catch up quickly in these areas and strive to create new achievements and new experiences, so that you can breathe together with the vast number of workers and peasants across the country and advance with the broad masses.

Vice Chairman Zhu further emphasized the significance of participating in physical labor, saying: People in socialist and communist societies must participate in labor. Everyone must not only use their brains to labor, but also use their hands to labor. You must establish communist ideas in labor and treat labor with a communist attitude. That is, as Lenin said, to work without regard to remuneration and work unconditionally for society. This is a key issue related to the establishment of a communist world outlook, the establishment of lofty ideas adapted to the task of transitioning to communism. This is also a key issue for passing the communism test after the war test, the land reform test, and the socialism test.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally called on the youth to continue to hold high the red flag and leap forward again and again on the road of socialist construction.

Gong Zirong, First Secretary of the Central Government Departments Committee of the Communist Party of China, also attended the conference and delivered a speech on the 14th, calling on the youth to be shock team members in the Great Leap Forward and pioneers in the technical and cultural revolutions.

At this conference, 940 young activists enthusiastically discussed how government youth can play a shock role in the comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Everyone unanimously stated that they would continue to strengthen ideological transformation, and strive to become conscious communist fighters; in the Great Leap Forward, they would link various youth work with the current central tasks of the country; establish the idea of continuous revolution, continue to break superstitions, and play a pioneering role in the tasks of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward and the technological and cultural revolutions.

After discussion, the conference unanimously approved the representatives of 79 young activists and advanced youth collectives from the central government departments to attend the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference to be held soon.

    朱副主席勉励青年过好共产主义关
    劳动不计报酬　工作不讲条件
    号召青年到边疆去，在那里的社会主义建设中大显身手
    新华社14日讯　中央国家机关青年社会主义建设积极分子大会于10月12日到14日在北京举行。朱德副主席在14日下午接见了参加大会的全体积极分子，并在大会上讲了话，对全国青年在大跃进中的任务作了重要指示。
    朱副主席在讲话中分析了全国大跃进的形势后说：在全国大跃进的形势下，全国青年特别是青年积极分子的任务，就是要在建成社会主义和准备逐步向共产主义过渡的伟大事业中起突击的作用。
    朱副主席勉励青年们说：青年们的特点，就是比一般成年人、老年人少受一切陈腐事物、陈腐观念的束缚，比较容易地接受新事物、新思想，敢想、敢说、敢做，热气高、干劲足。因此青年们应当而且也能够在当前的社会主义建设的伟大事业中，起突击的作用。正如古语所说的：“譬如积薪，后来居上”。
    但是，青年们要起到突击作用，必须以在共产党领导下，在从革命斗争中锻炼出来的无产阶级的先进的成年人、老年人的带领下，作为条件。青年人必须向革命的前辈们学习，向工农群众学习，也应当有批判地向其它成年人、老年人学习，学习他们一切有用的东西，把人类发展中的一切优良的成果都继承下来。拒绝学习，自骄自傲，是必然不能进步的。同时，你们应当“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”，胜过前人，反过来推动成年人、老年人前进。
    朱副主席还指示青年们要不断地进行自我改造，兴无灭资，继续完成政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的任务。为此，青年们就要积极地贯彻执行中共中央和国务院关于参加体力劳动的指示，使脑力劳动同体力劳动结合起来，使知识分子工农化，在劳动中向工农群众学习，并且帮助工农群众提高技术水平和文化水平。朱副主席说，这不仅是机关工作人员密切联系群众的重大措施，也是培养共产主义时代的新人的重大措施。
    朱副主席号召青年们特别要到西北和内蒙古等地区去，加速祖国边疆的建设，在那里的伟大社会主义建设中大显身手。朱副主席说：这些地区占了全国土地面积的50％到60％，地上、地下的资源异常丰富，是祖国最大的宝藏，但是这些地区的人口只占全国人口6％左右。为着建成社会主义和共产主义的幸福的新中国，全国广大的青年，包括机关青年，必须到这些地区去，把这些地区的富源迅速开发出来，把这些地区建设成为祖国的美丽的花园。
    朱副主席号召机关青年也要办工业、办农业、办红专学校和参加民兵组织。在当前特别是要参加全民的钢铁大战。朱副主席说：你们必须在这些方面急起直追，并且力求创造出新成绩、新经验，这样才能同全国广大工农群众呼吸相通，才能同广大群众一道前进。
    朱副主席进一步强调参加体力劳动的意义时说：社会主义和共产主义社会的人，是必须参加劳动的。每个人不但要用脑来劳动，而且要用手来劳动。你们必须在劳动中树立共产主义的思想，用共产主义的态度来对待劳动。也就是如列宁所说的，要不计较报酬地劳动，无条件地为社会工作。这是关系到建立共产主义的人生观，建立适应于向共产主义过渡这一任务的崇高思想的关键性问题，这也是继战争关、土改关、社会主义关之后，过共产主义关的关键性问题。
    朱副主席最后号召青年们继续高举红旗，在社会主义建设道路上跃进再跃进。
    中国共产党中央国家机关委员会第一书记龚子荣也在14日出席大会讲话，号召青年们当跃进的突击队员，做技术革命和文化革命的急先锋。
    在这次大会上，九百四十名青年积极分子热烈地讨论了机关青年在全面大跃进中如何发挥突击作用的问题，大家一致表示要继续加强思想改造，努力使自己成为自觉的共产主义战士；在大跃进当中要把各项青年工作和当前国家的中心任务联系起来；树立不断革命的思想，继续破除迷信，在全面大跃进和技术革命文化革命的任务中起先锋带头作用。
    大会经过讨论，一致通过中央国家机关的七十九名青年积极分子和青年先进集体的代表，出席不久将要召开的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
