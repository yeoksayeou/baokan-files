Factories Take Action, Everyone Designs
The First Ministry of Machine Building Determined to Accelerate the Development of Large Machine Tools

    (Our dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building recently held a National Large Machine Tool Experience Exchange Conference in Wuhan, broadly exchanging experiences in accelerating the production of large machine tools. These included valuable experiences such as self-reliance, arming oneself, simplifying machine tool structures, expanding variations and specialized varieties, simplifying universal machine tools, and using new materials to produce large machine tools. The conference also exchanged views on the division of labor among major large machine tool factories.

    Liu Qisheng, Director of the Second Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, said at the meeting: The prominent problem facing the machine tool industry is that the country's demand for metal cutting machine tools, especially large machine tools, is increasing day by day, but machine tool production is far from meeting the needs. During the Great Leap Forward, workers in various regions broke superstitions, dared to think and act, and created simplified structure machine tools, simplified indigenous machine tools, reinforced concrete structure machine tools, and welded structure machine tools, which solved the problem of insufficient large machine tools in many factories. These creations have opened up a broad path for solving the problem of tight supply of large machine tools, and also pointed out the direction for the future technological revolution and development of the machine tool industry. These experiences should be vigorously promoted.

    At the meeting, representatives from various units introduced their experiences in mass technological revolution. Everyone was very interested in the experience of many machinery factories in self-reliance and arming themselves. After accepting tasks such as manufacturing large-scale hydroelectric power equipment, Yongding Machinery Factory launched a campaign to make indigenous machine tools because their existing machine tools were too small to manufacture the required parts. In two months, they produced more than 60 indigenous machine tools, including a three-meter vertical lathe, a gantry planer, and a guideway grinder. Among them, the three-meter vertical lathe was modified from a belt-driven floor lathe, with the original faceplate laid flat as the table of the vertical lathe, the lathe bed erected as the column, and the saddle as the side tool post. Without a crossbeam, four waste short shafts were welded together to lengthen it for use. Although the appearance of this vertical lathe was not very beautiful, it was very practical and could fully meet the processing requirements of hydro-turbine parts. Chenguang Machine Factory also used reinforced concrete to make simple large machine tools such as ten-meter and six-meter gantry planers, four-meter vertical lathes, eight-hundred-millimeter slotting machines, and three-meter floor lathes. Representatives from many factories believed that arming oneself is an indispensable and regular task for machinery manufacturing factories. They should overcome dependent thinking such as waiting and reaching out for help, mobilize the masses, break superstitions, and manufacture economical and practical simple large machine tools by adapting to local conditions and making the best use of existing resources.

    Many units introduced their experiences in simplifying machine tool structures and developing variations and specialized varieties. The representatives believed that the purpose of simplifying structures is to "cut out the appendix and maintain hygiene," eliminate complex parts, and improve unreasonable geometric shapes and technical specifications of mechanisms, so as to improve machine tool performance. For example, a hydraulic control box for a grinder produced by Shanghai Machine Tool Factory had its parts reduced from more than twenty to seventeen in 1956. During this technological revolution, veteran worker Wu Delun, based on practical experience, further reduced the parts of the control box to eleven, saving a lot of man-hours and cast iron. It is estimated that 50 tons of cast iron can be saved annually. The product performance even exceeded the current world level. The three-meter gear hobbing machine independently designed by Chongqing Machine Tool Factory weighed 50 tons in total, while similar foreign machine tools weighed as much as 90 tons. This was mainly because they improved the product structure, replacing the mechanical unloading device with a hydraulic unloading device, and changing the sizes of large parts.

    The purpose of developing variant and special-purpose machine tools is to expand the standardization of parts, so as to use the least number of parts to form machine tools of various specifications and sizes, and better adapt to the different processing requirements of various departments. The C620 variant non-leadscrew lathe of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant reduced the total number of parts by 579 types, 1,154 pieces, saving 361 kilograms of cast iron per unit and more than 40 kilograms each of steel and iron plates.

    The large parts of large machine tools generally account for 60% to 80% of the total output of machine tools, using more metal materials. Casting large parts is not easy, and lifting requires larger overhead cranes, and processing requires larger equipment. This is a key issue in the manufacture of general large machine tools. In recent months, many places have used reinforced concrete structures to replace cast iron parts to make large machine tool components, and have manufactured large vertical lathes, large gantry planers, large gantry milling machines, and large lathes. The representatives pointed out in their speeches that this creation has many advantages: (1) It can save a lot of metal, generally accounting for more than 50% of the amount of large parts. (2) It can free up casting capacity to cast more other castings, and the output of machine tools can also be increased accordingly. (3) It can transform huge parts into combined parts of reinforced concrete structures with much smaller castings. In this way, even factories with only small machine tools can produce large machine tools; smaller lifting equipment can also be used. (4) It can reduce the production cost of machine tools. (5) Because it does not take a lot of time to make wooden molds and eliminates the need for sand cleaning, the production cycle of large machine tools can be shortened. (6) Reinforced concrete structure machine tools have better vibration resistance and can work more stably. They also pointed out that although reinforced concrete has shortcomings such as weak tensile strength and inability to resist strong acid corrosion, these can be overcome through research. Anhui Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory introduced at the meeting their method of using tung oil varnish to prevent acid, and Changsha Machine Tool Factory introduced their method of using porcelain powder and raw lacquer or acetone and celluloid to prevent acid.

    An Tiezhi, Deputy Director of the Second Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, emphasized in his summary: The task of the machine tool and tool industry is: "Fight hard for three years to meet the needs, master the cutting edge, and catch up with the world level." All machine tool factories should boldly mobilize the masses and carry out a large-scale technological revolution to accelerate the production of machine tools, especially large machine tools.

    厂厂动手　人人设计
    第一机械部确定加速发展大型机床
    本报讯　第一机械工业部最近在武汉召开全国大型机床经验交流会议，广泛交流了加速生产大型机床的经验。其中包括自力更生、自己武装自己，精简机床结构，扩大变型和专用品种，简化万能性机床，采用新材料生产大型机床等项宝贵的经验。会议还对各主要大型机床厂的专业分工等问题交换了意见。
    第一机械工业部第二局局长刘淇生在会上说：目前机床工业的突出问题，是国家对金属切削机床，尤其是大型机床的需要量日益增多，但是机床产量却远远不能满足需要。在大跃进中，各地职工破除迷信，敢想敢干，创造了精简结构机床、简化的土机床、钢筋混凝土结构机床、焊接结构机床等，解决了不少工厂大型机床不够的问题。这些创造为解决大型机床供应紧张的问题开辟了一条广阔的道路，也指出了今后机床工业技术革命发展的方向。这些经验应该大力推广。
    会上，各单位的代表介绍了群众性的技术革命的经验。大家对许多机械厂自力更生、自己武装自己的经验很感兴趣。永定机械厂接受了制造大型水轮发电设备等任务以后，因为机床小，无法制造，便掀起了一个做土机床的运动。经过两个月的时间，他们就制出了三公尺立车、龙门刨床、导轨磨床等六十多台土机床。其中三公尺立车是用皮带落地车床改装的，将原来的花盘平放作为立车的台面，床身竖立作为立柱，拖板作侧刀架，没有横梁便用四根废短轴焊起来接长使用。这台立车形式不大美观，却很实用，完全能够满足水轮机零件加工工艺的要求。晨光机器厂还用钢筋混凝土制成了十公尺、六公尺龙门刨，四公尺立车，八百公厘插床，三公尺落地车床等简易大型机床。许多工厂的代表都认为，自己武装自己是机械制造工厂必不可少的经常工作，应该克服坐等、伸手等依赖思想，发动群众，破除迷信，因地制宜，因陋就简地制造经济适用的简易大型机床。
    许多单位介绍了精简机床结构、发展变型和专用品种的经验。代表们认为，精简结构的目的，在于“割盲肠，讲卫生”，取消复杂的零部件，改进不合理的机构几何形状和技术规定，以便提高机床性能。例如，上海机床厂生产的一种磨床液压操纵箱，1956年曾把二十多件零件减少到十七件；在这次技术革命运动中，老工人吴德伦根据实践经验，又把操纵箱零件减少到十一件，节约了大量工时和铸铁。据估计，每年可以节约铸铁五十吨。产品性能还超过了目前世界水平。重庆机床厂自行设计的三公尺滚齿机总重五十吨，而国外同类型机床总重达九十吨之多。这主要是因为他们改进了产品结构，以液压卸荷代替机械卸荷装置，变更了大件尺寸等。
    发展变型和专用机床，目的在于扩大零部件标准化程度，以便用最少种数的零部件，组成各种规格尺寸的机床，更好地适应各部门不同的加工工艺的要求。沈阳第一机床厂的C620变型无丝杆车床，减少的零件总数达五百七十九种一千一百五十四件，每台可节约三百六十一公斤铸铁，节省钢材和铁板各四十多公斤。
    大型机床的大件一般占机床总产量的60％至80％，使用金属材料多，铸件翻砂不易，起重需要较大的天车，加工需要较大的设备。这是一般大型机床制造的关键问题。最近几个月，许多地方采用钢筋混凝土结构代替铸铁件做机床大件，制成了大立车、大龙门刨、大龙门铣、大车床等机器。代表们在发言中指出，这一创造有很多优点：（1）可以节约大量金属，一般占大件量的50％以上。（2）可以解放铸造能力，铸造更多其他的铸件，机床产量也可以随之增多。（3）可以把巨大的零件化为小得多的铸件的钢筋混凝土结构的组合件。这样，只有小机床的工厂也能生产大机床；起重设备也可以采用比较小的。（4）可以降低机床生产的成本。（5）因为不需要花很多时间做木模，免去清砂工作，可以缩短大型机床的生产周期。（6）钢筋混凝土结构机床具有更好的耐震性能，能够更平稳地工作。他们还指出，钢筋混凝土虽然有抗拉强度较弱、不能耐强酸腐蚀等缺点，但是可以研究克服。安徽蔡家岗矿山机器厂就在会上介绍了他们用洋干漆防酸的办法，长沙机床厂介绍了用瓷粉和生漆或者用?酮加赛珞珞防酸的办法。
    第一机械工业部第二局副局长安铁志在作总结时强调指出：机床与工具工业的任务是：“苦战三年，满足需要，掌握尖端，赶上世界水平”。各机床厂应该放手发动群众，大搞技术革命，使机床尤其是大型机床的生产加速发展。
