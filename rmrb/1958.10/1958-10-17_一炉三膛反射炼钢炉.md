The workers of the Electrician Team of the First Commercial Bureau of Zhengzhou, Henan Province, with the spirit of learning and originality, improved on the indigenous reverberatory furnace for steelmaking at the former Zhengzhou Agricultural Mechanization School. This resulted in one furnace with three steelmaking hearths, increasing production efficiency by more than tenfold. On October 4th, a new record of 420 jin of steel per furnace was achieved. This is a gratifying development in indigenous reverberatory furnace steelmaking.

The original reverberatory furnace of the Electrician Team of the First Commercial Bureau of Zhengzhou City was built in imitation of the reverberatory steelmaking furnace of the Agricultural Mechanization School. That type of furnace had small air intake, dispersed firepower, difficulty in slag removal, and high coal consumption, producing only 30 to 40 jin of steel each time. Aiming at these shortcomings, after research, the electricians changed the fixed furnace bars to movable furnace bars, reduced the steel tapping hole, expanded the steelmaking hearth, and changed the original square furnace to a truck shape to expand the reflecting surface and save firepower. Through the above improvements, the steel output per furnace increased from more than 30 jin to about 120 jin. At this time, they found that there was a large amount of residual firepower in the furnace, so they immediately researched how to make full use of the firepower and find the knack from the excess firepower. Finally, they created a "Jet Engine Type One Furnace Three-Hearth Reverberatory Steelmaking Furnace": three steelmaking hearths on three sides (front, left, and right), and a coal slag outlet and blast port on one side (back). In order to evenly reflect the firepower in the three hearths, three gates were added.

	  Building the Furnace

Choosing a suitable furnace base is the primary key to building the furnace. The furnace base must be selected in a dry and geologically solid place. A total of 600 green bricks and 200 refractory bricks are used for building the furnace. In order to save green bricks, small bricks can be appropriately filled in the inner gaps. Ordinary yellow earth mud is used for laying green bricks. A mixed mud of 70% Ganzi soil and 30% yellow sand is used for laying refractory bricks. For the mud plastering of the furnace belly, mix 60% Ganzi soil, 20% asbestos powder, 18% tank sand (if there is no tank sand, coal powder and slag can be used instead), and 2% salt powder evenly, and plaster it inside the refractory bricks, directly contacting the furnace fire and the steelmaking hearth. Use a three-horsepower blower, and each movable furnace bar is one meter long.

	  Batching

Each time the following materials are charged: 98% pig iron, 2% limestone, totaling 600 jin, with 200 jin of material loaded into each steelmaking hearth, and 200 jin of coal (Jiaozuo lump coal or Fengfeng lump coal).

	  Operation and Labor Organization

A total of eleven people are required for all operations: two for material preparation, and three for each steelmaking hearth (a total of nine people for the three steelmaking hearths). During operation, first light the fire, connect the blower, and then charge the materials. Then seal the furnace opening with yellow earth mud, block the steelmaking furnace door with refractory bricks, and check the firepower with the gates at any time. The entire operation takes one hour (including charging, melting, and tapping), but the steelmaking shall not be less than forty minutes. After tapping, first pull out the furnace bars, remove the slag, and then refine the second furnace. Steelworkers should preferably wear colored glasses and gloves. The handle length of tools (fire hooks, pliers, fire shovels) is best above 2.5 meters. (Attached picture)

    一炉三膛反射炼钢炉
    河南郑州第一商业局电工队职工，以学习和独创的精神，在原郑州农业机械化学校的土法反射炉炼钢的基础上作了改进，使一个炉子带三个炼钢炉膛，生产效率提高十倍多，于10月4日达到了每炉产钢四百二十斤的新纪录。这是土法反射炉炼钢的一个可喜的发展。
    郑州市第一商业局电工队原来的反射炉，是仿照农业机械化学校的反射炼钢炉建成的。那种炉进风小，火力分散，出渣难，耗煤高，每次只能出钢三、四十斤。针对这种缺点，经过研究，电工队职工将死炉条改为活炉条，缩小出钢口，扩大炼钢炉膛，并将原炉四方形改为卡车形，扩大反射面，节约火力。通过以上改进，每炉钢产量由三十多斤增加到一百二十斤左右。这时他们发现炉内火力有大量剩余，又立即进行研究如何充分利用火力，从多余火力上找窍门。最后终于创建了一座“喷气机式一炉三膛反射炼钢炉”：三面（前、左、右）三个炼钢炉膛，一面（后面）是出煤渣和鼓风口。为了使火力均匀反射三个炉膛，又增加了三个闸门。
          建　炉
    选择适当的炉基是建炉的首要关键，炉基必须选在干燥和地质比较坚实的地方。建炉共用青砖六百块，耐火砖二百块，为了节约青砖，内边空隙地方，可适当的填些小砖头。砌青砖用一般黄土泥。垒耐火砖用甘子土70％，黄沙30％的混合泥。糊炉肚泥用甘子土60％，石绵粉20％，缸砂18％（如无缸砂用煤面和炉渣代替也可），盐面2％搅拌均匀，糊在耐火砖以内，直接接触炉火和炼钢炉膛部分。使用三马力鼓风机，活动炉条每根长一公尺。
          配　料
    每次下料：生铁98％，石灰石2％，共计六百斤，每一炼钢炉膛装料二百斤、煤二百斤（焦作块煤或峰峰块煤）。	  操作和劳动力组织
    全部操作需十一人：备料二人，每一炼钢炉膛三人（三个炼钢炉膛共计九人），操作时先将火点着，风力接妥再下料，然后用黄土泥密封火炉口，用耐火砖挡住炼钢炉门，随时检查火力使用闸门。全部操作需用一小时（包括下料熔化和出钢锻打），但是炼钢不得少于四十分钟。出钢后，先将炉条抽出，清除炉渣，再炼第二炉。炼钢工人最好能戴有色眼镜及手套等。工具（火钩、钳子、火铲）的柄长最好在二点五公尺以上。（附图片）
