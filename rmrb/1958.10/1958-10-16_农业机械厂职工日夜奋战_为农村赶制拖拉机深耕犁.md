    Agricultural Machinery Factory Workers Work Day and Night
    to Rush Production of Tractors and Deep Plowing Plows for Rural Areas
    Our Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has recently been working day and night to rush production of fifty universal chassis tractors and eight deep plowing plows to support autumn plowing and sowing in the suburbs. After receiving this production task, everyone realized the importance of deep plowing for increasing agricultural production. In order not to delay the agricultural production season, all employees of the factory devoted themselves to an intense battle. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the factory Party Committee were very concerned about our production task. On September 20th, Liu Ren, the Second Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, personally came to our factory. He was very concerned about the completion of the deep plowing plow, which was a great encouragement to everyone. Many comrades said with emotion: "We must complete the task ahead of schedule and live up to the expectations of the Party." The workers fought day and night. Zhao Fenglin, a master craftsman in the forging workshop, and his female apprentices Sun Xiufen, Tian Huichun, and others, worked continuously for thirty-six hours without feeling tired. After several days and nights of hard work by the workers, the production task of deep plowing plows was finally completed ahead of schedule. The production task of fifty tractors was also completed after more than twenty days of hard work. This batch of universal chassis tractors will soon be sent to the People's Communes in the suburbs of Beijing. (Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory Lu Zhaohong Shi Minzhi)

    农业机械厂职工日夜奋战
    为农村赶制拖拉机深耕犁
    我们北京农业机械厂，最近日夜赶制了五十台万能底盘拖拉机和八部深耕犁，支援郊区的秋耕秋种。当我们接到这批生产任务后，大家都认识到秋耕深翻地对于农业增产的重要意义，为了不耽误农业生产季节，厂内全体职工投入了紧张的战斗。北京市委和厂党委对我们这项生产任务非常关心。9月20日市委第二书记刘仁同志曾亲自来我厂，他非常关心深耕犁的完成情况，这对大家更是一个很大的鼓舞。许多同志都感动地说：“我们一定要提前完成任务，不辜负党的希望。”工人同志们夜以继日地进行战斗。锻工车间赵凤林师傅和他的女徒弟孙秀芬、田会春等，曾连续苦战三十六小时，还不觉疲倦。经过工人同志们几天几夜的苦战，终于提前完成深耕犁的生产任务。五十台拖拉机的生产任务，经过二十多天的苦战也完成了。这批万能底盘拖拉机，不久即将送往北京郊区人民公社。　　（北京农业机械厂　卢兆洪　史敏智）
