	Luo Shengjiao's Company on the Guigang Construction Site
	At nine o'clock on the morning of the 12th, a north wind howled, and heavy rain poured down, turning the Guilin Steel Plant construction site into a mud river. The soldiers were soaked like drowned chickens, but they worked even harder. One shouted, "Add oil!" another yelled, "Run faster!" The sounds of labor drowned out the sound of the wind and rain.
	All the officers and soldiers of the reconnaissance company where Luo Shengjiao served before his death organized the Luo Shengjiao Youth Shock Brigade and were fighting the wind and rain on the construction site. 90% of the comrades in the first platoon were carrying double loads and walking like flying on a 150-meter section. Seeing that the road was very slippery, Deputy Company Commander Li Wenyu was afraid that the soldiers would fall, so he quickly picked up a shovel to repair the road. This year's newly enlisted Zhuang soldier, Meng Bangzheng, carried four baskets at a time. He thought, "This is my hometown, and a steel plant is about to appear in my hometown. What a great happy event! I should work harder."
	"Meng Bangzheng, can you handle it? Be careful not to fall," Deputy Company Commander said with concern.
	Meng Bangzheng said nonchalantly, "It doesn't matter, if I fall, I can get up and fight the wind and rain, and ask the wind and rain for steel!" As he spoke, he picked up four more baskets and shuttled through the crowd.
	"Give me two more baskets, carrying six baskets is not too much," a solid young man named Chen Shiyou requested of the soldiers shoveling soil.
	The deputy company commander interjected, "Do what you can, don't break yourself." As he spoke, he went to Chen Shiyou's carrying pole to take the baskets. Chen Shiyou held down the pole and said, "I can handle it, look!" As he spoke, he picked up the pole and ran away.
	At eleven o'clock, the heavy rain was still falling non-stop, and the loudspeaker broadcast the command headquarters' order to stop work. Upon hearing this, the soldiers roared and their energy soared. Five minutes passed, and the comrades wiped their shovels, tidied up their equipment, and prepared to leave the construction site. However, there were still a few soldiers digging soil and carrying soil, wanting to take this opportunity to dig a few more shovels and carry a few more loads. Another five minutes passed, and the deputy company commander issued the command to "go," and those young men had no choice but to carry their shovels and hoes and follow behind the team. The long labor team, facing the wind and rain, sang military songs loudly and returned in triumph.

    罗盛教连在桂钢工地上
    十二号上午九点钟，北风呼啸，大雨倾盆，桂林炼钢厂工地变成了泥河。战士们淋得像落水鸡一样，可是干得更欢。这个喊“加油呀！”那个叫“快跑呀！”劳动的声响盖过了狂风暴雨的声响。
    罗盛教生前所在的侦察连的全体官兵，组织了罗盛教青年突击队，正在工地上向风雨搏斗。第一排90％的同志都挑了双担在一百五十公尺的地段上行走如飞。副连长李文玉见路很滑，生怕战士跌倒，赶紧拿起铁锹去修路。今年入伍的僮族战士蒙邦政一次就挑四筐，他想：“这儿是我的家乡，家乡要出现钢铁厂了，多么大的喜事啊！我该加倍劳动才对。”
    “蒙邦政，挑得起吗？小心跌倒了。”副连长关心地说。
    蒙邦政满不在乎地说：“没关系，摔倒了可以爬起来向风雨搏斗，向风雨要钢呀！”说着又挑起四筐，穿梭在人群中。
    “再给二筐，我挑六筐不算多。”身体笃实的小伙子陈世友向铲土的战士要求着。
    副连长插嘴道：“要量力而行，不要压坏了。”说着，便去陈世友的挑子上取筐子。陈世友按着担子说：“我挑得起，你看！”说着便挑起担子飞跑起来。
    十一点钟了，大雨还在不停地下着，扩大器里传来了指挥部的收工命令。战士们听了，吼声四起，干劲更加冲天。五分钟过去，同志们擦锹、整装准备离开工地。可是，还有几个战士在挖土、挑土，想趁这个机会再多挖几锹，多挑几担。又过了五分钟，副连长发出“走”的口令，那几个小伙子才不得不扛起锹镐跟在队伍的后面。长长的劳动队伍，迎着狂风暴雨，高唱军歌，凯旋归去。
