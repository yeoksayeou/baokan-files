Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th. The river network project in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province has opened up broad prospects for transportation. The Ministry of Communications specially convened an on-site conference on river network development in Anhui Province, attended by ten provinces and cities, to study how to combine the large-scale river network water conservancy projects in the plains areas this winter and next spring with the development of shipping to better serve the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Minister of Communications Wang Shoudao spoke at the meeting. He believed that the comprehensive utilization of river networks not only drives the development of industrial and agricultural production, sideline production, and forestry, but also creates favorable conditions for the great development of transportation. He called on the heads of transportation departments from various provinces and cities attending the meeting to recognize the trend that the greater leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the future will bring more arduous tasks to the transportation industry, to learn and apply the experience of river network development in Anhui Province, and to formulate local plans according to local conditions so that transportation work can keep up with the development of industrial and agricultural production. Sun Dagang, Vice Minister of Communications, pointed out that water transport has the advantages of large transport capacity and low cost, and is one of the important modes of transportation. Combining river network development with vigorous shipping is in line with the general line of going for greater, faster, better and more economical results. He said that the scale of water conservancy projects across the country this winter and next spring is unprecedented, and we should cooperate well with the water conservancy departments so that our navigable mileage can increase by hundreds of thousands of kilometers next year.

The attendees visited Shanqiao Township in Linquan County, Chengji Township in Fuyang County, and Wolong Lake in Suixi County in Huaibei for six days. They saw that the areas that have initially realized river network development have stored rivers and ditches full of water, water transportation is accessible in all directions, and the rice on both sides of the river is growing tall; they believed that the Huaibei area's combination of river network development and shipping is the best example of implementing the "local, mass, and universal" policy for developing the transportation industry.

The meeting required transportation departments in various regions to take advantage of the large-scale river network development this winter and next spring, cooperate with relevant departments such as water conservancy and agriculture, and engage in large-scale construction to achieve a great leap forward in our country's shipping industry. Transportation departments should adhere to the principle of overall planning and unified arrangement, and cooperate closely with relevant departments; transportation departments should also pay attention to internal cooperation. We must not only grasp the shipping construction of large river networks, but also grasp the shipping problems of small river networks.

    结合河网化大搞航运
    交通部在安徽召开河网化现场会议
    据新华社合肥7日电　安徽省淮北地区的河网化工程，给交通运输开辟了广阔的前途。交通部特地在安徽省召开了十个省、市的河网化现场会议，研究了如何结合平原地区今冬明春大搞河网化水利工程，发展航运事业，以便更好地为工农业生产的更大跃进服务。
    交通部部长王首道在会上讲了话。他认为河网化的综合利用，不但带动了工农业生产、副业生产和林业的发展，而且也为交通运输的大发展创造了有利条件。他号召到会的各省市交通部门负责人，要看到今后工农业生产的更大跃进将给交通运输业带来更为繁重的任务的趋势，要学习并应用安徽省河网化的经验，因地制宜地制订出本地的规划，使交通运输工作跟上工农业生产发展的形势。交通部副部长孙大光指出：水上运输具有运量大、成本低的优越性，是交通运输的重要方式之一。结合河网化大搞航运，是符合多快好省的总路线精神的。他说：今冬明春全国的水利工程规模是空前的，我们应当同水利部门很好配合，这样就可以使我们明年的通航里程增加几十万公里。
    到会的人曾到淮北的临泉县单桥乡、阜阳县程集乡和濉溪县的卧龙湖进行了六天的参观。他们看到初步实现河网化的地区已经蓄了满河满沟的水，水上运输四通八达，河道两旁的水稻长得人把高；他们认为淮北地区结合河网化发展航运，是贯彻发展交通事业的“地、群、普”方针的最好范例。
    会议要求各地交通部门趁今冬明春大搞河网化的时候，协同水利、农业等有关部门，大兴土木，把我国的航运事业也来一个突飞猛进。交通部门要本着全面规划、统一安排的方针，同有关部门紧密协作；交通部门内部也要注意协作。既要抓大河网的航运建设，也要抓小河网的航运问题。
