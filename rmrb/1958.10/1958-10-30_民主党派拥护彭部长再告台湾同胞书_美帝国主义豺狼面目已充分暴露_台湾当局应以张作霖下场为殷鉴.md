Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: The Central Committee members and heads of various departments of the central government of the Jiusan Society held a meeting in Beijing on the 26th. Everyone warmly expressed their support for the second letter to Taiwan compatriots issued by Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai.

Everyone unanimously agreed that the statement issued by Minister Peng further exposed and sternly condemned the US aggressors' conspiracy to occupy our territory of Taiwan, armed interference in our internal affairs, and attempt to create "two Chinas." The Chinese people liberating Taiwan and the coastal islands is entirely an internal affair of the Chinese people and is a matter for the Chinese people themselves. No one can interfere or has the right to interfere.

Those attending the meeting all pointed out that the facts of the past few months have also proved that the brinkmanship policy played by warmonger Dulles has been completely bankrupt in the face of the powerful Chinese people. It has also further proved that the American imperialists, who are baring their teeth and claws, are actually paper tigers. Their war provocations in the Taiwan Strait have fallen into a dilemma.

At the meeting, everyone also unanimously believed that the Taiwan authorities should realize that all imperialists are unreliable. The incident of Zhang Zuolin being bombed to death in Huanggutun can serve as a lesson from the past. There are two paths before the Taiwan authorities: one is to return from the wrong path, conduct peace talks as soon as possible, turn enemies into friends, and unite the people of the whole country to drive the national enemy, the American robbers, out of the Taiwan Strait. The other is to continue to depend on American imperialism, and then one day they will be abandoned by the American aggressors. Which way to go, I hope the Taiwan authorities will think deeply.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: A spokesperson for the China Zhi Gong Party issued a statement supporting Minister Peng Dehuai's second letter to Taiwan compatriots. The spokesperson said that in this statement, Minister Peng once again pointed out the only correct and feasible way out for the military and civilians in Taiwan, hoping that they would value national righteousness and unite to deal with the American aggressors. This great act of benevolence and delivering charcoal in the snow should deeply move the broad patriotic military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu.

The statement pointed out that we Chinese people absolutely will not allow the Americans to realize their conspiracy to forcibly create "two Chinas." This is also the common will of all the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and patriotic overseas Chinese. We millions of patriotic overseas Chinese all know that only under the independence, unification, and prosperity of the motherland can their legitimate rights and interests in their places of residence be guaranteed. Their current common demand is to unite with the people of the motherland, unite in patriotism, and resolutely oppose the American aggressors' interference in our domestic affairs and their conspiracy to create "two Chinas." Any ideas and practices that violate this common demand of overseas Chinese will be resolutely opposed by all patriotic overseas Chinese.

The American imperialists' ambition to create "two Chinas" and permanently occupy Taiwan has become increasingly clear. The series of aggressive tricks it has carried out against the Chinese people is something that no one with a little national self-esteem can tolerate. The Chinese people must never allow the Americans to occupy Taiwan, and any American armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan. Now is the time for all Chinese people to unite and drive out American imperialism. This era is an era full of hope, and all patriots have a way out. Patriotism knows no order, and with the national enemy at the forefront, we hope that the military and civilians in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will value national righteousness, jointly crush all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, and return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th: Xu Guangping, vice chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, made the following statement on Minister Peng Dehuai's second letter to Taiwan compatriots:

Minister Peng Dehuai's second letter to Taiwan compatriots is earnest and sincere, fully expressing the confidence and determination of the 650 million people of the whole country to smash all aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism; it also expresses the sincere hope of the people of the whole country to sincerely advise the Taiwan authorities to return from their wrong path.

Military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, American imperialism is our common enemy. The first step in the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism is to isolate Taiwan, and the second step is to put Taiwan under trusteeship. Its wolfish face has now been exposed even more clearly. During Dulles's visit to Taiwan this time, he exhausted the rogue methods of political brokers, high-pressure deception, and wishfully wanted the Chinese to do this and that, harming the interests of the Chinese and suiting the interests of the Americans. If he is slightly dissatisfied, he will stop at nothing. It is very obvious that when American imperialism believes that you are no longer useful to it, it will definitely abandon you. Didn't U.S. Vice President Nixon reveal bluntly at a press conference held in Hartford, Connecticut on October 22nd that he was prepared to kick you aside? Zhang Zuolin was once used by Japanese imperialism, but when Japanese imperialism realized that he had lost his value, it killed him in Huanggutun. The lesson from the past is not far away and is worth pondering.

There is only one China in the world, not two Chinas, and we are unanimous on this point. The American imperialists' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" is absolutely impossible to succeed. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people have made great achievements in the cause of socialist construction. Especially in the past year, industrial and agricultural production has developed by leaps and bounds. Due to the increasing prosperity and strength of the motherland, coupled with the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, we have the strength to smash all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism. The affairs of the Chinese people can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves, and the Americans are not allowed to interfere. All the Chinese people, including you and overseas Chinese, absolutely will not allow the American conspiracy to create "two Chinas" to succeed.

Military and civilian compatriots in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, now is the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, and all patriots have a way out and have hope. Don't be afraid of imperialists anymore. We are all Chinese, and the affairs of the Chinese can only be resolved by the Chinese themselves. I hope you will consider this statement carefully.

    民主党派拥护彭部长再告台湾同胞书
    美帝国主义豺狼面目已充分暴露  台湾当局应以张作霖下场为殷鉴
    新华社28日讯　九三学社在京中央委员和中央各部会负责人在26日举行会议，大家对我国防部彭德怀部长发布的再告台湾同胞书热烈表示拥护。
    大家一致认为，彭部长发表的文告，进一步揭发和严正谴责了美国侵略者霸占我国领土台湾、武装干涉我国内政和妄图制造“两个中国”的阴谋诡计。中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿，完全是中国人民的内政问题，是中国人自己的事，任何人都不能干涉，也无权干涉。
    参加会议的人都指出，几个月来的事实也证明了战争狂人杜勒斯所玩弄的战争边缘政策，在强大的中国人民面前，已经彻底破产，也进一步证明了张牙舞爪的美帝国主义者实际上是一只纸老虎，它在台湾海峡的战争挑衅，已经陷于进退维谷的境地。
    会上大家还一致认为，台湾当局应当认识到：一切帝国主义者都是靠不住的，张作霖炸死在皇姑屯的事件，可作前车之鉴。摆在台湾当局面前的有两条道路：一条是迷途知返，及早进行和谈，化敌为友，全国人民团结一致，把民族大敌美国强盗赶出台湾海峡。另一条是继续依附于美帝国主义，那末总有一天会被美国侵略者所抛弃。何去何从，希望台湾当局深思。
    新华社28日讯　中国致公党发言人发表谈话拥护彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书。发言人说，彭部长在这个文告中为台湾军民同胞再一次指出其唯一正确可行的出路，希望他们以民族大义为重，一致起来对付美国侵略者。这种仁至义尽，雪里送炭的伟大行为，台、澎、金、马的广大爱国军民同胞们应该深受感动。
    谈话中指出，我们全中国人绝对不容许美国人实现其强迫制造“两个中国”的阴谋。这也是所有台、澎、金、马军民同胞和爱国华侨的共同意志。我们千百万爱国华侨都知道，只有在祖国的独立、统一和强盛的情况下，他们在侨居地的合法权利和利益才能够得到保证。他们当前的共同要求就是：与祖国人民一道，团结爱国，坚决反对美国侵略者在我国国内事务上插手和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。任何违背华侨这一共同要求的想法和做法，都将受到全体爱国华侨的坚决反对。
    美帝国主义制造“两个中国”永久侵占台湾的野心是愈来愈清楚地暴露出来了，它对我们中国人民所进行的一连串侵略伎俩，实为任何一个稍有民族自尊心的人所不能容忍的。中国人民绝不能让美国人盘据台湾，美国的任何武装力量必须退出台湾。现在已是我们中国人共同起来一致对外驱逐美帝国主义的时候了。这个时代是一个充满希望的时代，一切爱国者都有出路。爱国不分先后，民族大敌当前，希望台、澎、金、马的军民同胞们，以民族大义为重，共同起来粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋，早日回到祖国的怀抱。
    新华社28日讯　中国民主促进会副主席许广平就彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书发表谈话如下：
    彭德怀部长再告台湾同胞书，语重心长，充分表达了全国六亿五千万人民粉碎美帝国主义一切侵略阴谋的信心和决心；也表达了全国人民善意劝告台湾当局应当迷途知返的真诚愿望。
    台、澎、金、马的军民同胞们，美帝国主义是我们的共同敌人。美帝国主义的侵略阴谋第一步是孤立台湾，第二步就要托管台湾。它的豺狼面目，现在已经暴露得更加清楚。杜勒斯这次到台湾，耍尽了政治掮客高压欺诈的流氓手段，妄想叫中国人做这样、做那样，损害中国人的利益，适合美国人的利益。稍不如意，就会无所不用其极。很明显，等到美帝国主义认为你们对它不再有用处的时候，它就一定会把你们抛弃掉。美国副总统尼克松10月22日在康涅狄格州哈特福德举行的记者招待会上，不是已经露骨地说出了准备一脚踢开你们的话了吗？张作霖曾被日本帝国主义利用，但日本帝国主义发觉到他已失去利用价值时，就在皇姑屯把他治死。殷鉴不远，值得深思。
    世界上只有一个中国，没有两个中国，这一点我们是一致的。美帝国主义妄想制造“两个中国”的阴谋，这是绝对不能得逞的。我国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，取得了社会主义建设事业的巨大成就。特别是在最近不到一年的时间内，工农业生产有了飞跃的发展。由于祖国的日益繁荣富强，加上我们有全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持，我们完全有力量粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。中国人的事，只能由中国人自己解决，不容许美国人来插手。全中国人民，包括你们和海外侨胞在内，是绝对不容许美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋得逞的。
    台、澎、金、马军民同胞们，现在是东风压倒西风的时代，一切爱国者都有出路，都有希望。不要再怕什么帝国主义者了。我们都是中国人，中国人的事只能由中国人自己解决，愿你们三复斯言。
