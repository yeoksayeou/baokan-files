    Libelous Prize Money

    The Swedish Academy has decided to award the Nobel Prize in Literature to a slanderer, hoping to use this to slander the Soviet Union. Turning the Literature Prize into a libelous prize is only a mockery of the Literature Prize itself, and also an insult to all genuine literary figures who have accepted and will accept this prize. How could the Soviet Union ever be harmed by this?

    诽谤奖金
    瑞典科学院决定把诺贝尔文学奖金授给一个诽谤家，想借此来诽谤苏联。把文学奖金变成诽谤奖金，这只能是对这种文学奖金的本身的讽刺，而且也是对曾经接受和以后将要接受这种奖金的所有纯正文学家的侮辱。苏联又何曾受到伤害呢？
