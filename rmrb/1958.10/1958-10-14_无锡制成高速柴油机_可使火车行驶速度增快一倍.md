    Wuxi Manufactures High-Speed Diesel Engine
    Doubles Train Speed

    According to Xinhua News Agency, a 1,000-horsepower high-speed diesel engine for trains has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory.

    This twelve-cylinder, double-row, four-stroke high-speed diesel engine has a speed of 1,500 revolutions per minute. Its characteristics are light weight, with a total weight of no more than three tons, and an average of no more than three kilograms per horsepower; small size, about two cubic meters; and low fuel consumption, with fuel consumption of less than 180 grams per horsepower per hour.

    This diesel engine is mainly used as a power machine for railway transportation; after mass production, it will gradually replace the steam locomotives currently used on China's trains with internal combustion locomotives. The steam locomotives currently in use travel at about 80 kilometers per hour, while internal combustion locomotives can travel at 160 kilometers per hour.

    The Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory used to produce small diesel engines of 45 to 60 horsepower. In the trial production of the 1,000-horsepower high-speed diesel engine, the workers fully promoted the communist style. Communist Party member and veteran worker Shi Peiqing worked continuously for five days and nights without rest. Sometimes when there was a temporary power outage, the workers used hand drills. After more than 20 joint experiments by technicians and workers, they finally overcame the difficulties in processing technology and successfully trial-produced it in 80 days. (Attached picture)

    无锡制成高速柴油机
    可使火车行驶速度增快一倍
    据新华社讯　一部一千马力的火车用高速柴油机，最近在无锡柴油机厂试制成功。
    这部十二缸双列式四冲程高速柴油机，每分钟转速为一千五百转。它的特点是轻，总重量不超过三吨，平均马力不超过三公斤；体积小，约二立方公尺；耗油省，每马力一小时耗油在一百八十克以下。
    这种柴油机主要作为铁路运输动力机械用；大量制造以后，将使我国的火车从现在的蒸汽机车逐步改为内燃机车。目前所用的蒸汽机车，每小时约行驶八十公里，而内燃机车每小时可以行驶一百六十公里。
    无锡柴油机厂过去一直是生产四十五到六十马力小型柴油机。在试制一千马力高速柴油机中职工们充分发扬了共产主义风格。共产党员、老工人史培清连干了五昼夜没有休息。有时遇到临时停电，工人们就用手摇着钻孔。经过技术人员和工人二十多次的共同试验，他们终于克服了加工工艺上的困难，以八十天的时间试制成功。（附图片）
