    鸭绿江边悬灯结彩
    安东热情准备迎接志愿军
    新华社安东25日电　安东各界人民今天在庆祝抗美援朝八周年的同时，正在热情洋溢地积极进行欢迎中国人民志愿军最后一批部队撤返祖国的筹备工作。
    今天，安东市披上了节日的盛装，到处插满红旗、彩旗、悬挂彩灯。写着“欢迎中国人民志愿军归国”、“伟大的抗美援朝运动胜利万岁”等字样的各种颜色的巨幅标语，高悬马路上空。透过车站广场上的高大松树牌楼一眼望去，站前的主要街道，已经打扮成一条五彩缤纷的彩色长廊。
    矗立在鸭绿江桥头的雄伟的凯旋门，已经洗刷一新。车站站台上四十个红色方形立柱，写上了“向英雄的中国人民志愿军致敬”、“一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖”等一百六十条大字标语。
    全市工人正以最紧张的劳动，争取今天在钢铁、电力和生产总值方面，发射出三颗高产卫星，以此欢迎志愿军胜利归来。
