    Strengthen Communist Education to Consolidate People's Communes
    Guangxi Grasps Ideological Construction in a Timely Manner After Achieving Communization
    Zhejiang Widely Publicizes the Superiority of People's Communes to Promote the Development of the Communization Movement
    Nanning, October 5th (Reported by this newspaper) – After the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region achieved people's communization, it immediately launched a communist ideological education movement to enhance the communist consciousness of the vast number of commune members. Currently, tens of thousands of reporters and propagandists organized by Party committees at all levels are conducting propaganda activities on steel construction sites and water conservancy construction sites. More than five million farmers have received communist education at least once. Individualism that focuses on personal gains and losses and departmentalism that only cares about the interests of one's own commune or township have been seriously criticized, and communist spirit has generally risen, with people's mental outlook undergoing changes.
    In early September, when the autonomous region achieved people's communization, some wealthy farmers and agricultural cooperatives with thick assets and high production were afraid of suffering losses from merging with agricultural cooperatives with thin assets and low production. Therefore, some took the opportunity to use the internal funds of the cooperative in a big way, wanting to join the commune empty-handed. In order to further help the vast number of farmers raise their awareness and fully understand the superiority of the people's commune, the Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region decided to immediately conduct communist propaganda and education to the farmers. Since mid-September, the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels in Guilin, Baise, Liuzhou, Yulin, and other regions have personally taken charge, and the members of the Party committees at all levels have served as reporters or propagandists, mobilizing the entire Party to publicize the superiority of the people's commune to the masses. The Yongning region organized a propaganda and reporting army of more than 120,000 people, using various forms such as mass meetings, broadcasts, reports, folk songs, cartoons, big-character posters, symposiums, and debates to conduct in-depth propaganda in the fields and construction sites. The propagandists organized by the Party committees at all levels in the Guilin Special Zone, taking the original small cooperatives or natural villages as units, publicized the superiority of the people's commune to the masses day and night, and launched major debates on issues such as "How to run the people's commune well" and "Is it a loss for rich cooperatives to merge with poor cooperatives?"
    After receiving communist education, people of all ethnic groups broadened their horizons and conducted self-criticism of individualism and departmentalism, greatly promoting the spirit of communist cooperation. The members of Shuoshe Township in Laibin County were originally afraid that poultry would be nationalized after joining the commune, so they killed all the chickens and ducks. After communist education, they realized that "the commune is like a family" and "the commune must be run by everyone." They reviewed their past selfish behavior and immediately contributed bricks and materials to build twenty-one small iron-smelting furnaces and contributed five tons of scrap copper. The two small cooperatives along the river in the Rising Sun People's Commune of Longsheng Autonomous County originally believed that they had thick assets and high incomes, and that it would be a loss to merge with the two agricultural cooperatives in the high mountains. After conducting accounting and recalling the past among the masses, everyone realized that although the cooperatives along the river were richer, they had fewer laborers. During the early and mid-rice transplanting and summer harvesting and planting this year, the cooperatives in the high mountains dispatched more than 400 laborers to support them, so that they could complete the tasks on schedule and achieve an average yield of 800 jin per mu for early rice. Without the support of the commune members in the high mountains, it would have been impossible to increase production by 62% compared with last year. As a result, departmentalism was swept away, and they no longer cared about who was losing out or taking advantage, but wholeheartedly worked for the commune, and everyone worked together to engage in production. The members of the Xinxu, Sandu, and Baipeng townships of the Red Flag People's Commune in Liujiang County proposed to offer a great gift to the commune, striving to be the first in everything. For late rice weeding and topdressing, field management was generally done six times. The Qiongtun production team of Baipeng Township mobilized men, women, old, and young, and all kinds of tools, taking buckets and foot basins to transport manure and water to attack the rice plants with fertilizer.

    Hangzhou, October 5th (Reported by this newspaper) – Zhejiang Province is carrying out a grand people's communization propaganda and education movement, vigorously establishing communist ideology.
    By mid-September, the first batch of 228 people's communes in Zhejiang Province had been established. The tremendous superiority displayed by these people's communes after their establishment strongly attracted the vast number of cadres and masses, and the trend of running people's communes spread throughout the province, and the high tide of realizing people's communization has arrived.
    Cadres in Ningbo, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Jiande, Zhoushan, and other special zones and Hangzhou City studied and discussed the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of people's communes in rural areas. All Red and Expert schools in Ningbo Special Zone listed the relevant documents on people's communes as required courses. More than 1,100 cadres in Hangzhou City also launched debates and criticized individualism and departmentalism. After studying and airing their views and debating, the cadres saw the prospects of the people's commune, broadened their horizons, expanded their minds, and resolved to overcome individualism and departmentalism, establish new communist ideas, and go all out to run the commune.
    After the vast number of cadres improved their understanding, the propaganda and education movement for people's communization unfolded more vigorously in various places. Whether in mountain gullies, islands, rural villages, fishing villages, or small towns, propaganda teams appeared everywhere; big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, slogans, and cartoons all regarded the promotion of people's communes as the most important content; newspapers, radio stations, and wired broadcasts throughout the province continuously promoted the superiority of people's communes and reported on the situation and experience of the masses running people's communes in various places. The professional and amateur literary and art armies throughout the province also threw themselves into the vigorous people's communization propaganda movement, clearing the way for the universal establishment of the framework of people's communes throughout the province. Their slogan is: "Red flags are planted throughout urban and rural areas, folk songs are composed and sung everywhere, thousands of troops and horses are deployed, and various forms are blooming." Hangzhou City has dispatched propaganda teams composed of more than 100,000 people, including literary and art workers, Party propagandists, and cadres, for several consecutive days, educating more than 400,000 people.
    The large-scale propaganda and education work greatly improved the communist consciousness of the masses and promoted the development of the people's communization movement. After propaganda, the vast number of masses said that the direction was more specific and clearer, and they were determined to run the people's commune well. "Bringing communist ideas into the commune and bringing first-class seedlings into the commune" has almost become a common action slogan for members of agricultural cooperatives. Some areas also put forward four "do not bring": do not bring blank fields into the commune, do not bring third-class seedlings into the commune, do not bring crops with diseases and pests into the commune, and do not bring fields with weeds into the commune. In order to eliminate third-class seedlings, 2,500 people in Mayu District, Ruian County, are fully engaged in weeding and fertilizing every day.

    加强共产主义教育巩固人民公社
    广西实现公社化后及时抓紧思想建设
    浙江广泛宣传人民公社优越性促进公社化运动发展
    本报南宁5日电　广西僮族自治区在实现人民公社化以后，紧接着开展了共产主义思想教育运动，以提高广大社员的共产主义觉悟。目前各级党委组织的成千上万的报告员、宣传员队伍，正在钢铁工地、水利工地进行宣传活动。有五百多万农民普遍受到了一次以上的共产主义教育。斤斤计较个人得失的个人主义和只顾本社、本乡的利益的本位主义，已受到严肃批判，共产主义精神普遍高涨，人们的精神面貌正在起着变化。
    9月初，自治区实现人民公社化时，有部分富裕农民和家底厚、增产多的农业社，怕同家底薄、增产少的农业社合并吃亏，因而，有的趁机大用社内资金，想白手加入公社。为了进一步帮助广大农民提高觉悟，使广大农民充分了解人民公社的优越性，自治区各级党委决定立即向农民进行共产主义宣传教育。9月中旬以来，桂林、百色、柳州、玉林等地区各级党委书记亲自挂帅，各级党委成员担任报告员或宣传员，全党动员，向群众宣传人民公社的优越性。邕宁地区组织了一支十二万多人的宣传、报告大军，采用了大会广播、报告、山歌、漫画、大字报、座谈会、辩论会等多种形式，深入田间、工地宣传。桂林专区各级党委组织的宣传员，以原小社或自然村为单位，夜以继日地向群众宣传人民公社的优越性，展开“如何办好人民公社”，“富社与穷社合并是不是吃亏”等问题大辩论。
    各族人民经过了共产主义教育后，打开了眼界，对个人主义、本位主义思想，纷纷进行自我批评，大大发扬了共产主义协作精神。来宾县朔社乡的社员，原来怕入公社后家禽归公，把鸡鸭都杀了。经过共产主义教育后，认识到“公社好比一家亲”、“公社要靠大家办”，对过去的自私自利行为进行了检讨，同时立即献砖献料，建好二十一座小炼铁炉，献出废铜五吨。龙胜各族自治县日新人民公社沿河的两个小社，原来认为自己家底厚、收入多，与高山上的两个农业社合并吃亏。经过在群众中展开算账、回忆，大家认识到沿河边的社虽然富裕些，但劳动力少，今年抢插早、中稻和夏收夏种时，高山上的社共抽调了四百多个劳动力来支援，才能按期完成任务，取得了早稻平均每亩产八百斤的丰收；如果没有高山上的社员们的支援，是不可能比去年增产62％的。于是，本位主义思想一扫而光，再也不去计较谁吃亏谁占便宜了，而是一心一意办公社，大家同心协力搞生产。柳江县红旗人民公社新墟、三都、百朋等乡的社员们提出要为公社献大礼，样样争第一，对于晚稻耘田追肥，田间管理一般做到六次。百朋乡琼屯生产队，男女老少、大小工具一齐出动，拿水桶、脚盆去运水粪攻禾胎肥。　（李益芳）
    本报杭州5日电　浙江省开展规模壮阔的人民公社化宣传教育运动，大立共产主义思想。
    浙江省到9月中旬，第一批二百二十八个人民公社已经建成。这些人民公社建立后显示的巨大优越性，强有力地吸引着广大干部、群众，办人民公社之风弥漫全省，实现人民公社化的高潮已经到来。
    宁波、嘉兴、温州、建德、舟山等专区和杭州市的干部，都学习讨论了中共中央关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议。宁波专区所有的红专学校，都把有关人民公社文件列为必读课程。杭州市一千一百多干部还展开了辩论，对个人主义和本位主义思想进行了批判。经过学习和鸣放辩论，干部们看到了人民公社的远景，眼界宽了，胸襟开阔了，决心克服个人主义、本位主义，树立共产主义新思想，鼓足干劲办公社。
    广大干部提高认识以后，人民公社化的宣传教育运动在各地就更加蓬蓬勃勃展开。不论山沟、海岛，不论农村、渔村和小城镇，到处出现了宣传队；大字报、黑板报、标语、漫画等，都把宣传人民公社作为最重要的内容；全省的报纸、电台、有线广播都连续地宣传人民公社的优越性，报道各地群众办人民公社的情况和经验。全省各地专业和业余的文艺大军，也投入了轰轰烈烈的人民公社化宣传运动，为全省普遍搭起人民公社架子鸣锣开道。他们的口号是：“红旗插遍城乡，民歌到处编唱，千军万马上阵，形式百花齐放。”杭州市连日出动了包括文艺工作者、党的宣传员、干部等十多万人的宣传队伍，使四十多万人受到教育。
    声势浩大的宣传教育工作，大大提高了群众的共产主义觉悟，推动了人民公社化运动的发展。广大群众经过宣传后说，方向更具体、更明确了，决心要办好人民公社。“要带共产主义思想入公社，要带一类苗入公社”，几乎成了农业社社员普遍的行动口号。有的地区还提出了四不带：不带空白田入公社，不带三类苗入公社，不带有病虫害的农作物入公社，不带有杂草的田地入公社。瑞安县马屿区为了消灭三类苗，每天有二千五百人全力投入耘田施肥。
