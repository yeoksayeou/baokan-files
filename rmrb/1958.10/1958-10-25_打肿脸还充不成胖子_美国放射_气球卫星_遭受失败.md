Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd, Cape Canaveral (United States) dispatch: The United States Army's experiment to launch a "balloon satellite" with a "Jupiter-C" four-stage rocket at Cape Canaveral late on the 22nd suffered another failure. The United States originally hoped that this satellite, which would be greatly inflated by gas, would become the first American satellite that could be seen with the naked eye, but this failure dashed that hope.

As everyone knows, the United States has so far only successfully launched four small satellites. Because these satellites are too small, they cannot be seen with the naked eye.

Due to the low level of rocket technology, the United States cannot launch satellites as large and heavy as the Soviet artificial satellites, which can be easily seen with the naked eye. Therefore, this time they came up with an idea: to launch a satellite that is not very heavy and does not carry any instruments, but is very large in volume. They placed a balloon in a compressed state in the head of the fourth-stage rocket. This balloon was made of extremely thin plastic film and covered with a layer of highly reflective aluminum foil. If this balloon satellite entered orbit, it would be filled with nitrogen. In this way, this "balloon satellite," which weighs only 4.16 kilograms, could be inflated by nitrogen into a large sphere with a diameter of 3.6 meters. Even so, the expected brightness of this satellite is much worse than the brightness of the carrier rocket of the Soviet third satellite. The United States Army authorities named this empty satellite, which can only be seen by being inflated, "Beacon."

However, two hours and twenty minutes after the launch, the US Department of Defense announced that the rocket's actions were abnormal and that the launch had failed again. "Beacon" was destroyed before it was even seen once.

This is the third failure of the United States to launch a satellite using the "Jupiter-C" rocket. The United States has also experienced six failures in launching satellites with the "Vanguard" rocket. (Attached picture)

    打肿脸还充不成胖子
    美国放射“气球卫星”遭受失败
    新华社23日讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国陆军22日深夜在卡纳维拉尔角用“丘辟特—C”式四级火箭发射一个“气球卫星”的试验，又遭到了失败。美国本来指望这个靠气体撑得大大的卫星，成为美国第一个可以用肉眼看到的卫星，但是，这次失败却使这一希望落空了。
    大家知道，美国到目前为止只发射成功四个小卫星。这些卫星由于太小，都不能用肉眼看到。
    由于火箭技术水平不高，美国不能发射像苏联人造卫星那样大而重的、可以很方便地用肉眼看到的卫星。因此，这次他们想出了一个主意：发射一个重量不大、不携带任何仪器而体积却很大的卫星。他们在第四级火箭头部放了一个呈压缩状态的气球。这个气球用极薄的塑料膜制成，外面包有一层反光能力很高的铝箔。这个气球卫星如果进入轨道后就将充满氮气。这样，这个重量虽然只有四点一六公斤的“气球卫星”，却可以被氮气撑成一个直径为三点六公尺的大球。即使这样，这个卫星的预计亮度比苏联第三个卫星的运载火箭的亮度还要差许多。美国陆军当局却把这个靠撑大才能被看见的腹内空空的卫星命名为“灯塔”。
    可是，在发射了两小时二十分钟后，美国国防部即宣布，火箭行动不正常，这次发射又告失败，“灯塔”连一次还没有被看到就毁掉了。
    这是美国用“丘辟特—C”式火箭发射卫星遭到的第三次失败。美国用“先锋号”火箭发射卫星也遭到过六次失败。（附图片）
