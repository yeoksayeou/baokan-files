Literature must combine with the laboring people.

We must establish socialist literature, establish a working-class literary force. Literature is no longer the literature of a few "spiritual aristocrats," but the literature of hundreds of millions of laboring people. Of course, all this will not come out of thin air; it means a decisive battle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology in the field of literature and art.

Comrade Mao Zedong made a profound analysis of the current domestic situation: "Never before have we seen the masses of the people so invigorated, so high in morale, and so full of spirit. The past exploiting classes are completely submerged in the vast ocean of the laboring masses. They have to change even if they don't want to, and there are certainly some who will never change until they die and are willing to take their granite heads to see God, but that is not of overall importance. All decadent ideologies and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are collapsing day by day. It will still take time to completely sweep away this garbage; the trend of these things to collapse is certain."

At present, all bourgeois thinkers, writers, and artists cannot but be affected by this socialist revolutionary wave. Facing such a soaring era, we must solve a fundamental problem: are we to be gravediggers for the stagnant bourgeois individualistic literature and art? Or, through a thorough change of ideology and position, become true literary artists of the laboring people? The rectification movement in literary and art circles is to solve such a fundamental problem.

It is not easy to explain such a huge class struggle in spiritual life in a few words, but the sharp struggle we have waged with the bourgeois rightists and revisionists in literary circles has been particularly focused on the relationship between politics and art. The essence of this question is whether or not to acknowledge the purposefulness of literature. All progressive writers throughout history have regarded serving the purpose of improving society through literature as their sacred mission. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Lenin's principle of the party spirit of literature and explicitly stipulated that literature and art should be used as powerful weapons for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy. It should help the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind. During the period of transition to socialism, it is still full of class struggle, and people must gradually eliminate bourgeois ideology in the struggle. At this time, literature should of course become a more distinct red flag. In fact, is there really any purposeless literature? The bourgeois reactionaries are merely using the excuse of opposing the purposefulness of our literature serving revolutionary politics to achieve their own purpose of making literature serve reactionary politics. The Yugoslav revisionist cultural program attempts to use words such as "freedom," "truth," and "the structure of the human spirit" to deny the distinct purposefulness and tendency of proletarian literature, in order to allow bourgeois ideology to occupy positions in Yugoslav literature. From Howard Fast in the United States to Hu Feng, Feng Xuefeng, and Qin Zhaoyang in China, they all use the excuse of so-called "fullest freedom rights" and "being one's own master" to make literature serve their purpose of opposing the proletarian socialist cause. Isn't this very obvious? Their purpose is to create division among the laboring people and in socialist society. This is precisely the opposite of our purpose of uniting ourselves and attacking the enemy. We believe that literature has always had its own distinct purposefulness. Historically, truly outstanding literary works have always been widely circulated and accepted by people not only for their ideological value, but also for their artistic value, because they relatively profoundly reflect the progressive elements of the people and promote the progress of that era. When the light of Marxist truth illuminates the path of literature, especially after the establishment of socialist society, the new literature more consciously expresses the era of the new people and serves the interests of the laboring people. It is such a new literature, a free literature: labor creation becomes a widely praised theme, the laboring people become heroes in the works, literature cultivates new people with communist morality and communist style, and it becomes a torch for striving for the realization of the communist ideal on a global scale.

The question is very clear: the writers of the socialist era should be the writers of the laboring people. In fact, only the laboring people's own writers can sing so freely about their own heroic era. As for the bourgeois writers, they are often incompatible with this heroic era. Perhaps some people think that with the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, they have naturally become socialist writers? We believe that things are much more complicated than this, and there must be a fundamental class change in between. Because whether your soul is red or white, whether your love for the laboring people and socialism is genuine or your hatred is genuine, this ultimately determines the fundamental factor of your literary face, and no writer can hide the true expression of their feelings in their own works. Is the writer integrating themselves into the masses of the people like a grain of salt dissolving in water and becoming their faithful spokesperson, or are they standing above the masses of the people with their arms folded, regarding themselves as "uncrowned kings" who are "above everything"? Do they believe in and rely on the wisdom and experience of the masses, or do they rely only on their personal "cleverness" and "genius"? Do they treat people and things with the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people, or with a narrow, dark individualistic perspective? This series of fundamental questions has not been resolved among all writers.

The river of literature is developing in a tortuous and roundabout way. For a long time, it cannot but be under the shadow of the influence of bourgeois ideology. In addition to depriving the laboring people of the right to enjoy literature and art, the bourgeoisie also spread the germs and rust of individualism among the bourgeois intellectuals. The ruling class concentrates culture on a small number of people in their own class. They want to select people from their class and cultivate them into excellent people, but all this is built on the basis of harming and burying the broad masses. This is why the so-called "heroes" and "rabble," "those who rule" and "those who are ruled," and the gap between "mental laborers" and "physical laborers" have been created. In fact, all this is just the ruling class's criminal brand of spiritual enslavement of the people. As long as we carefully analyze it, even some excellent realist and humanist writers in history cannot but be subject to this artificial limitation, because most of them came from the exploiting classes, and only later in the complex real life, influenced by the masses of the people, did they become figures with democratic ideas. Therefore, in their era, they sympathized with the people and were dissatisfied with the status quo. They once exposed the bad habits of life and challenged the darkness of society, but they could not find a real way to break the shackles of class. Because if they were to do so, they would have to make the most thorough break with the class that nurtured them and completely stand with the laboring people, becoming a member of the laboring people. Gorky's description of critical realism as the realism of the bourgeois "prodigal son" is of profound significance. It is true that the nineteenth-century literature left a very rich artistic achievement, but we have leaped so far, we have already lived in the ideal society that they did not even dare to imagine. We will cherish their artistic achievements most, and learn their artistic skills, but we never have the need to blindly believe in the ancients and belittle ourselves. Green comes from blue and is better than blue. We have developed from the old literary foundation, and our era requires us to surpass them. However, people have also brought this criminal mark into the revolutionary camp. Many writers from bourgeois backgrounds participated in the struggle led by the Communist Party with the tide of nationalism or democratic revolution. However, in essence, they only agreed with the party's program in a certain historical stage, and did not think carefully about the issue of realizing socialism and communism. Therefore, they felt that their accustomed lifestyles and ways of thinking, artistic hobbies and artistic methods, did not need to be shaken or destroyed in any way, and some even vainly attempted to realize their individualistic desires in the revolutionary tide. But the socialist revolution rang a loud bell, which shows that the more in-depth the socialist revolution is, the more the literary and artistic trends, methods, styles, tastes, etc. as the superstructure are bound to undergo fundamental changes as the capitalist economic foundation collapses. To become a writer of the new era, one must transform oneself thoroughly, otherwise, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago, one will be "unfamiliar and ignorant" of the laboring people and the new society, and one will have "no place to use one's talents."

Such "heroes" are of course declining "heroes." Gorky said: "The basic theme of pre-revolutionary literature was personal tragedy." And our literature is now a literature that expresses the heroic destiny of the people. Thus, from aesthetics to artistic techniques, changes must occur due to the shock of the revolution. Faced with such a vigorous and passionate era, all the language and forms used by bourgeois literature to express the psychological changes of aristocratic women and intellectuals become pale and weak, and pale in comparison, and in many cases can only become a cowardly moan. Just compare the heroic poems that the laboring people are currently singing loudly with the poems of some poets who are deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, and you can see that one is a fiery sun, and the other is just a floating "thin cloud at the end of the sky," and this thin cloud is still gray. The poet has not been liberated from the slavery of bourgeois art, that is, he has not been liberated from spiritual slavery. Another phenomenon is that due to the deep influence of bourgeois literature, specializing in depicting "bad phenomena of life" has become a deeply rooted inertia for many people. Don't they have intelligence and talent? No, their "humor" and "wit" often only serve to uglify our times. They inappropriately move the spicy ridicule of the characters of the old society to the masses of the people in the new era. This kind of ridicule can only become a malicious attack. These facts require us to carry out a thorough revolution on the literary front. For individualistic writers, this cannot but be a "tragedy"; to change the fate of this tragedy, one can only make a thorough transformation from position to thought and feeling. At the same time, only a true ideological transformation can bring about a true artistic creation.

Of course, this does not mean abandoning the excellent traditions of literature. Comrade Mao Zedong said very clearly that what is about to collapse in front of us is "all decadent ideologies and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure." For those healthy, excellent, and applicable literary heritages, only the decadent and desperate bourgeois literature is the strangler of these heritages and their unfilial descendants; as for us, we are not only their best successors, but also make them get real carry forward. For example, the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism that we advocate in literature foreshadows how the mainstream of excellent literary traditions will be inspired and spirited in our socialist era, in the combination of literature and art with the broad masses of the laboring people.

From the above, it shows the task of writers from bourgeois backgrounds in our current era: on the one hand, to break with the old world, and on the other hand, to combine with the new era. Only in this way can writers from bourgeois backgrounds find their solid foothold in socialist life. The key to combining with the new era is to truly and deeply combine with the laboring masses, and to combine with the masses through class struggle and production labor. First become a member of the ordinary laboring people, and then become the spokesperson of the laboring people. The Marxist road can only be like this.

This has long been pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong, and has been proven by the development of our socialist literature, that is, writers go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and go to the fiery struggle. This means that the writer should be a participant in changing the world and an ordinary laborer. Here, whether the writer appears in the masses as a special person or as an ordinary laborer is often a fundamental criterion for testing whether a writer can be thoroughly integrated with the laboring people. On this issue, I think we have two completely different experiences:

One is that some writers go to the masses not to participate in the struggle, not to participate in labor, but just to experience life and collect materials. It is impossible to produce works that fully reflect real life in this way. Because they regard themselves as special in the masses, they will inevitably break away from the masses, and then they cannot be completely integrated with them in spirit, and cannot deeply feel the pulse and breath of the struggle life of the masses, and as a result, they cannot truly express the masses of the people. It is very clear that if a writer breaks away from the revolutionary struggle and breaks away from the life of the laboring people, bourgeois ideology will inevitably grow; if he cannot express the thoughts and feelings of the laboring people, he will inevitably express bourgeois thoughts and feelings. Not long ago, under the slogan of "interfering in life," some people used the narrow minds and dark eyes of the bourgeoisie to look at the new world and published some so-called "exposing the darkness" slanders of socialist life. Among them, in particular, Qin Zhaoyang's thesis "Realism - A Broad Road" which expounded this view, and Liu Binyan's feature "Internal News of This Newspaper" which practiced this view, the facts show that they have degenerated into shameful revisionist elements.

And another correct path: is to appear as an ordinary laborer and directly participate in the class struggle and participate in production labor. Truly combining with the laboring people requires determination, long-term, and even painful tempering. This is a profound change from one class to another. This combination cannot be superficial or temporary, but should be in-depth and long-term. But in this way, as a result, they can change their thoughts and feelings from the practice of labor and struggle, love labor, and love laborers, and can deeply understand the emotions, morals, and psychological state of laborers. You must know that communist morality and communist style are sprouting and growing in real life. If you are a participant in the real struggle, you will not only see these advanced things around you, but it will also grow in you. It first illuminates your mind and illuminates your eyes, so that you can have sharp eyes to analyze life and penetrate the essence of life. Isn't this the factor that determines the value of a Marxist writer? Does it determine the value of a writer's literary work? This brilliant truth has been fully confirmed in our literary works in 1957-1958. 1957-1958 was a year of fierce battle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology in Chinese literary life, but it was also a year of ideological harvest and creative harvest. The poisonous fog of revisionist theory and creation cannot cover up the mighty mainstream of our socialist realism literature. Not only in theory, but also in creation, the revisionists in literature were thoroughly attacked, making them completely bankrupt. For example, the recently appeared "Red Flag Spectrum", "Lin Hai Xue Yuan", "Red Sun", "Bitter Vegetable Flowers", "Song of Youth", "Hundred Refinements Become Steel", "Mountain Village Changes", "Blue Qinggang Forest" and other novels are deeply loved by readers and widely circulated literary works. But it is particularly worth noting here that the reason why some literary works are particularly outstanding should be said to be inseparable from the author's long-term training in the real struggle.

When the nationwide Great Leap Forward began, the Party called on writers to go to the masses to participate in production and construction, participate in grassroots work, live and breathe with the people, and grow and advance with the boiling life. The writer becomes a socialist builder in that area, and then becomes a writer who reflects the struggle life in that construction area. Beijing writers were the first to respond to this call. People went to the construction posts like they were going to the battlefield in those years. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. This is a new atmosphere in literary and art circles. People are radiating revolutionary spirit from their hearts. Writers no longer stay in the major cities, but are scattered all over the country to settle down. Up to now, more than 700 writers across the country have gone to the masses. This is a big wave in the socialist revolution on the literary front. This time, it not only clarified that writers must combine with labor production and with the laboring masses, but also clarified that this combination should not be temporary, but must be long-term, which fundamentally solves the problem of the relationship between writers and life. Perhaps some people think that he has already fought and worked hard, and now in the period of peaceful construction, does he still need to get out of his quiet corner and go to close contact with the masses again? People who hold this view do not know that the revolution is constantly and continuously developing forward. We build socialism and also build communism. Life always brings us fresh people and fresh things, which we need to constantly understand and understand. Stagnation means rusting, which means decay. If we cannot advance together with the masses of the people in the revolutionary tide, the red flag will fade into light red, gray, and even white. Of course, wholeheartedly participating in labor does not mean that a writer only needs to complete the task of an ordinary worker or farmer and give up their own task of literary creation. No, we firmly support writers' creation, but we feel that it is more appropriate to solve this problem according to such a formula: "participate in labor struggle - writing - participate in labor struggle". Because in this way, a writer's life will be deeply lived among the masses, constantly participating in the struggle, and constantly reflecting the struggle.

The change in the writer's spirit certainly determines the change in the face of the literary work. The writers of the socialist era, combined with the masses of the people, nurtured by the masses of the people, flowing with the blood of the laboring people in their own blood vessels, and filled with the feelings of the laboring people in their own minds, have the conditions of a laboring people's writer. At the same time, learning from the literary creation of the people, poets learn from folk songs, novelists get rich nourishment from folk legends, writers combine with the rich source of the people's creation, and writers can create forms that are accepted by the people and loved by the people. This can truly solve the major problem of national style in literary creation. Only by going deep into the life of the masses and learning from the masses can we create literary works that truly combine revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. However, just as the truth of Marxism-Leninism is developed in the struggle, the socialist literature under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism cannot but enter the struggle from the beginning, and grow and develop in the struggle. In such a struggle, whether to combine with the masses of the people or to break away from the masses of the people is the fundamental difference between socialist writers and bourgeois individualistic writers. Our socialist literature is the literature of the masses of the people. It grows on the solid ground of the masses of the people. The vitality of the people flows like an endless source. As long as we truly and thoroughly combine with the masses of the people, the people's literature will also be full of more vigorous enthusiasm and will shine with more magnificent brilliance, just as people hold high the torch of communist truth and stride forward. In short, they will surpass all literature in human history, and they will be the newest and most beautiful literature.

    文学必须与劳动人民结合
    刘白羽
    我们要建立社会主义文学，要建立工人阶级文学队伍，文学不再是少数“精神贵族”的文学，文学是亿万劳动人民的文学。当然这一切不会凭空得来，这意味着文学艺术领域内无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的决战。
    毛泽东同志对当前国内形势作了深刻的分析：“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋、斗志昂扬、意气风发。过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中，他们不想变也得变，至死不变，愿意带着花冈岩头脑去见上帝的人，肯定有的，那也无关大局。一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”
    目前一切资产阶级出身的思想家、文学家、艺术家都不能不身受着这一社会主义革命浪潮的冲击。面对着这样一个飞腾的大时代，我们必须解决这样一个根本性问题：是为僵死的资产阶级个人主义文学艺术作看墓人？还是通过彻底的思想、立场的改变成为真正的劳动人民的文学艺术家？文艺界的整风运动，就是解决这样一个根本性问题的。
    用几句话来说明精神生活中这样一场巨大的阶级斗争是不容易的，但是，我们和文学界的资产阶级右派、修正主义者所进行的尖锐的斗争，特别集中在政治与艺术关系的问题上。这问题实质上就是承认不承认文学的目的性。历来的进步文学家，都把文学为改善社会这个目的而服务，当作自己的神圣使命。毛泽东同志发展了列宁的文学党性原则，明确地规定了：文艺要作为团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人的有力的武器。它应当帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。在建设社会主义过渡时期，依然充满着阶级斗争，人们要在斗争中逐步地消灭资产阶级思想，这时文学当然应该成为一面更加鲜明的红旗。事实上，难道真有什么无目的的文学吗？资产阶级反动派只不过是借口反对我们文学为革命的政治服务的目的性，而达到他们的使文学为反动的政治服务的目的性而已。南斯拉夫修正主义文化纲领就是企图用“自由”“真理”“人的精神结构”等字眼来否定无产阶级文学的鲜明的目的性、倾向性，以求得资产阶级意识在南斯拉夫文学占领阵地。从美国的法斯特到中国的胡风、冯雪峰、秦兆阳等都同样借口于什么“最充分的自由权利”、“自己作主”，而使文学服从于他们的反对无产阶级社会主义事业的目的，这不是很显然吗？他们的目的，就是在劳动人民中，在社会主义社会中制造分裂。这与我们所要求的团结自己，打击敌人的目的，正好针锋相对。我们认为文学从来都是有着自己的鲜明的目的性的。历来的真正杰出的文学作品，总是由于它比较深刻地反映了人民的前进的因素，推进了那个时代向前发展，才不但从它的思想价值上，而且从它的艺术价值上，被人们接受而广泛流传下来的。当马克思主义真理的光芒照亮了文学的道路，特别是在建成了社会主义社会之后，新的文学便更自觉地来表现新的人民的时代，为劳动人民的利益服务了。它是这样一种新的文学、自由的文学：劳动创造成为被广泛歌颂的主题，劳动人民成为作品中的英雄，文学培养着具有共产主义道德和共产主义风格的新人，它成为争取共产主义理想在全世界范围实现的火炬。
    问题十分清楚，社会主义时代的文学家，应当是劳动人民的文学家。事实上也只有劳动人民自己的文学家，才能那样自如地歌唱自己这个英雄的时代，至于资产阶级文学家，他们常常对这英雄时代格格不入。也许有人以为随同着社会主义在经济、政治、思想战线上革命的胜利，他们自己也已经自自然然地就成为社会主义文学家了吧？我们认为事情要远比这复杂得多，这中间要有一个根本的阶级变化。因为你的灵魂深处，是红是白，对劳动人民、对社会主义是真正的爱还是真正的憎，这终究是决定着你的文学面貌的根本因素，而任何作家是无法在自己作品中掩饰自己的真情流露的。作家是把自己像一粒盐溶在水里一样溶合在人民群众中间而成为他们的忠实的代言人，还是袖起两手站在人民群众之上把自己视为“高出一切”的“无冕之王”？是相信而且依靠群众的智慧与经验，还是只凭着个人的“聪明”与“天才”？是以劳动人民的思想感情，还是以狭小、阴暗的个人主义眼光去对待人与事？这一系列根本性问题，并不是在所有的作家中间都已得到解决。
    文学这道河流，是曲折而迂回地发展着的，长期以来它不能不处在资产阶级思想影响的阴影之下。资产阶级除了剥夺劳动人民享受文学艺术的权利之外，还在资产阶级知识分子中散布了个人主义的细菌和毒锈。统治阶级把文化集中在他们自己阶级中的少数人身上，他们要选拔他们阶级中的人培养成为优秀的人，但这一切是建筑在损伤与埋没广大群众的基础上的。所以才造成了所谓
  “英雄”与“群氓”，“治人者”与“治于人者”，“脑力劳动者”与“体力劳动者”的鸿沟。其实这一切只不过是统治阶级对人民进行精神奴役的罪恶烙印而已。只要我们仔细分析一下就是历史上一些优秀的现实主义、人道主义的文学家也不能不受着这种人为的限制，因为他们大都出身于剥削阶级，只是后来在复杂的现实生活中，受到人民群众的影响，才成为具有民主思想的人物。因此，在他们所处的时代，他们同情人民，不满现状，他们曾经揭穿生活的恶习，向社会的黑暗挑战，但是他们却无论如何不能找寻到打破阶级枷锁的真正出路。因为如果要那样，他们就只有对养育他们的阶级进行最彻底的决裂，而完完全全站到劳动人民中，变成劳动人民的的一员。高尔基把批判的现实主义称为资产阶级的“浪子”的现实主义，是有深刻意义的。不错，十九世纪的文学，留下了非常丰富的艺术成就，但我们已经飞跃的这样远了，我们已经生活在他们连想也不敢想的理想社会之中了，我们将最珍惜他们的艺术成就，学习他们的艺术技巧，但我们绝没有一味迷信古人，贬低自己的必要，青出于蓝而胜于蓝，我们是从旧的文学基础上发展起来的，而我们的时代要求我们超过他们。可是，人们也把这种罪恶的烙痕带进革命阵营内部来了。不少资产阶级出身的文学家，随着民族主义或民主主义革命的浪潮，参加了共产党所领导的斗争。不过实质上他们只同意党在一定历史阶段上的纲领，并没有去好好思索过实现社会主义、共产主义的问题。因此，他们觉得他们所习惯了的生活方式和思想方式，艺术的爱好与艺术的方法，并不必要受到什么震动或破坏，有的甚至还妄想在革命浪潮中实现他们个人主义的欲望。但社会主义革命敲起了一记响亮的钟声，它说明社会主义革命愈深入，资本主义的经济基础土崩瓦解的时候，作为上层建筑的文学艺术的思潮，方法，风格，趣味等势必也要跟着发生根本的变化。要成为新时代的文学家就要彻头彻尾改造自己，否则就会像毛泽东同志早已指出的那样，对劳动人民，对新社会“不熟、不懂，英雄无用武之地”。
    这样的“英雄”，当然是没落的“英雄”。高尔基谈过：“革命以前的文学基本主题乃是个人的悲剧。”而我们的文学，现在是表现人民群众英雄的命运的文学了。于是从美感到艺术手法，都不能不由于革命的震撼，而要发生变化。摆在这样一个朝气蓬勃、热流奔放的大时代面前，资产阶级文学那一切用以表现贵族妇女和知识分子心理变化的语言和形式，变得苍白无力，黯然失色，而在许多场合只能成为一种怯懦的呻吟罢了。只要把目前劳动人民放声高唱的英雄诗篇，和某些深受资产阶级影响的诗人的诗比一下，就可以看出，一个是火热的太阳，一个只不过是飘浮的“天末微云”，而且这微云还是灰色的。诗人没从资产阶级艺术的奴役下解放出来，也就是没从精神的奴役下解放出来。另一种现象是由于资产阶级文学的影响太深，专门描写“生活的坏现象”，已成为不少人根深蒂固的惰性。难道他们没有聪明与才智吗？不，他们的“幽默”与“机智”，常常只能起丑化我们的时代的作用。他们把对旧社会的人物辛辣的嘲讽，不适当的搬到新时代的人民群众身上，这种嘲笑，自然只能成为恶毒的攻击。这种种事实，要求我们在文学战线上也必须进行彻底的革命。对于个人主义的文学家来说，这不能不是一个“悲剧”；要改变这种悲剧的命运，只有从立场到思想、感情来一个彻底改造，同时，也只有真正的思想改造才能够带来真正的艺术创造上的革新。
    当然，这绝不意味着抛弃文学的优良传统。毛泽东同志讲得非常明确，在我们面前要崩溃的，是“一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其它不适用的部分”，对于那些健康的优秀的，适用的文学遗产，只有现在那些没落的，绝望的资产阶级文学，才是这些遗产的扼杀者，是它们的不肖的子孙；至于我们，不但是它们的最好的继承者，而且还会使它们得到真正的发扬。如像我们在文学方面提倡的革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义的结合，就预示着：优秀的文学传统的主流，在我们的社会主义时代，在文学艺术与广大劳动人民结合中将会怎样地激昂奋发、神采飞扬。
    从以上所述说明，我们现时代的资产阶级出身的文学家的任务：一方面是同旧世界的决裂，一方面是同新时代的结合。只有这样，资产阶级出身的文学家在社会主义生活中才能寻找到他们的牢固的立脚点。而同新时代的结合，关键就是真正地、深刻地同劳动群众结合，通过阶级斗争和生产劳动同群众结合。先成为普通劳动人民的一员，然后成为劳动人民的代言人，马克思主义的道路只能是这样的。
    这是早已由毛泽东同志指出，而经过我们的社会主义文学发展所证明了的，这就是作家到工农兵当中去，到火热斗争中去。这就是说作家要作为一个变革世界的参预者，一个普通劳动者。在这里，作家到群众中去，是以一个特殊人的身份还是以一个普通劳动者姿态出现，经常是检验一个作家与劳动人民是否能够彻底结合的根本标准。在这问题上我想我们有着两种截然不同的经验：
    一种是有的作家到群众中去，不是参预斗争、参预劳动，而只是体验一下生活，收集一下材料，这样做不可能产生充分反映现实生活的作品。因为在群众中自视特殊，必然脱离群众，那就不能在精神上和他们完完全全打成一片，不能深深地感受到人民群众斗争生活的脉搏和呼吸，结果也就无法真实地表现人民群众。事情十分明白，一个作家脱离革命斗争，脱离劳动人民生活，必然就滋长资产阶级思想；不能表现劳动人民的思想感情，结果就必然表现资产阶级思想感情。不久以前，有些人在“干预生活”口号下，就是这样以资产阶级狭窄的心胸、阴暗的眼光看待新世界，发表了一些所谓“暴露黑暗”的诽谤社会主义生活的作品。其中特别是阐述这种观点的秦兆阳的论文“现实主义——广阔的道路”，和实践这种观点的刘宾雁的特写“本报内部消息”等，事实说明他们已经堕落成为可耻的修正主义分子了。
    而另一种正确的道路：就是以一个普通劳动者姿态出现，直接地参加阶级斗争，参加生产劳动。真正和劳动人民的结合，只有下定决心，经过长期的，甚至是痛苦的磨炼，这是从一个阶级到另一个阶级的深刻变化，这种结合不能是浮浅的，暂时的，而应当是深入的，长期的，但正是这样，结果就能够从劳动与斗争的实践过程中，使自己的思想感情发生变化，热爱劳动，热爱劳动者，才能深刻地体会劳动者的情感、道德和心理状态。要知道，共产主义道德和共产主义风格，正是在现实生活中萌芽、成长的。如果你是现实斗争的参预者，你就不但在你的周围看到这种先进的事物，同时它也就在你自己身上成长，它先照亮了你的心灵，照亮了你的眼睛，你才能有锋利的眼光去分析生活，透入生活的本质。不正是这种因素，决定一个马克思主义作家的价值吗？决定一个作家的文学作品的价值的吗？这一个辉煌的真理在我们1957—1958年的文学作品中得到充分的证实。1957—1958年，是中国文学生活中，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想激烈交战的一年，但同时也是思想上丰收，创作上丰收的一年。修正主义理论和创作的毒雾，并不能掩盖我们社会主义现实主义文学浩浩荡荡的雄伟的主流。不但从理论上，并且正是从创作上，彻底地打击了文学上的修正主义者，使他们完全破产。如像新近出现的“红旗谱”“林海雪原”、“红日”、“苦菜花”、“青春之歌”、
  “百炼成钢”、“山乡巨变”、“蓝色的青棡林”等长篇小说就都是这样在读者中间受到深切的热爱，而广泛流传的文学作品。但这里特别值得注意的是，一些文学作品之所以特别优秀，应当说是与作者在现实斗争中经历过长期锻炼是无法分开的。
    全民大跃进开始时，党就号召作家到群众中去参加生产建设，参加基层工作，与人民同生活同呼吸，与沸腾生活一道生长前进。作家成为那一地区社会主义建设者，然后成为反映那一建设地区斗争生活的作家。北京的作家首先响应这一号召。人们就像当年走向战场一样走上建设岗位。这是非常可喜的现象，这是文艺界的新风气，人们从心里焕发出革命精神，作家不再停聚在主要的大城市里面，而分散到全国各地去安家落户。到现在为止，全国已经有七百多作家走到群众中间去了，这是文学战线上社会主义革命的一个大浪潮，这一回不但明确了作家必须与劳动生产结合，与劳动群众结合，而且明确了这种结合不应是暂时的，必须是长期的，这就使得作家与生活的关系这一问题得到了根本解决。也许有人以为他已经战斗过了，已经劳动过了，现在在和平建设时期，他难道还用得着走出自己安静的角落，而再去与群众密切联系吗？持这种见解的人，不知道革命是永远地不断地向前发展着的，我们建设了社会主义还要建设共产主义，生活总给我们带来新鲜的人和新鲜的事，需要我们经常去认识，去理解。停滞就意味着生锈，就意味着腐朽，不能和人民群众在革命浪潮中一同前进，红旗就会褪成淡红色、灰色，以至白色的。当然，全心全意地参加劳动，并不等于只要一个作家去完成一个普通工人或农民的任务，而放弃他们自己本身的文学创作的任务。不，我们坚决地支持作家创作，但是我们觉得按照这样一个公式：“参预劳动斗争——写作——参预劳动斗争”来解决这问题是比较恰当的。因为这样一来，一个作家的一生便是深深地生活在群众之中不断地参预斗争，而又不断地反映斗争的一生。
    文学家的精神的变化当然决定着文学作品的面貌的变化。社会主义时代的文学家，与人民群众结合，得到人民群众的哺养，在自己的血管里流着劳动人民的血，在自己的心灵中充满劳动人民的感情，才具有一个劳动人民作家的条件，而同时，向人民的文学创作学习，诗人向民歌学习，小说家从民间传说中得到丰富的营养，作家与丰富的人民群众创作源泉结合，作家才能创造出为人民所接受、为人民所喜爱的形式，这样才能够真正解决文学创作中的民族风格这一重大问题。既深入群众生活，又向群众学习，才能够创造出真正是革命现实主义与革命浪漫主义相结合的文学作品。但是正如同马克思列宁主义真理是在斗争中发展出来的一样，在马克思列宁主义指导下的社会主义文学也不能不从一开始时就进入斗争，在斗争中成长壮大。在这样的斗争中，是与人民群众结合，还是脱离人民群众，这就是社会主义文学家与资产阶级个人主义文学家的根本区别。我们社会主义文学，是人民群众的文学，它是生长在人民群众这个牢固的地面上的，人民的生命力像无穷无尽的源泉一样流着，只要我们真正地、彻底地与人民群众结合，人民的文学也必然像人们高举共产主义真理火炬阔步前进那样，将充满更蓬勃的热情，将闪烁更瑰丽的光彩。总之，它们将超过人类历史上所有的文学，它们将是最新最美的文学。
