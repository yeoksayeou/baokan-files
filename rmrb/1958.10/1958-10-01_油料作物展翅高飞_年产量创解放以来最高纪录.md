Xinhua News Agency Report: This year, the nation's oil crops have achieved a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the total output of the four major oil crops—soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame—will reach 400 million dan, an increase of approximately 40% compared to 1956, the year with the highest output since liberation, and an increase of over 50% compared to last year. The total output of various other oil crops such as flax, hemp, castor beans, sunflowers, and perilla will also increase by several tens of percent, one-fold, or several-fold compared to last year.

The summer-harvested oil crop—rapeseed—achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. According to actual harvest statistics from various regions, the nation's 37,920,000 mu of winter-sown and spring-sown rapeseed yielded a total of 27,690,000 dan of rapeseed, an increase of 56% compared to last year. The average yield per mu reached 73 jin, an increase of over 43% compared to last year. The average yield per mu in Hubei, Anhui, Shanghai, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces (municipalities) and autonomous regions has increased by more than one-fold or close to one-fold compared to last year. Last year, only Sichuan and Gansu provinces had rapeseed yields exceeding 100 jin per mu. This year, in addition to the aforementioned two provinces, the average yield per mu in Jiangsu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region also exceeded 100 jin. In addition, according to statistics, the total area of high-yield demonstration fields with rapeseed yields of 100 to 200 jin per mu reached over 7,480,000 mu, the area with yields of 200 to 300 jin per mu reached over 529,000 mu, and the area with yields of 400 to 500 jin reached over 1,040 mu. High-yield "satellite" fields with yields of over 500 jin to over 2,000 jin per mu reached over 197 mu. These large-area high-yield fields and "satellite" fields account for over 21% of the total rapeseed area.

This year, the nation has planted a total of over 140 million mu of soybeans. It is estimated that the national average soybean yield per mu will exceed last year's by approximately 60%, reaching 172 jin. The total output, despite a decrease of over 40 million mu in planting area compared to last year, will still reach over 250 million dan, exceeding last year's by 25%. High-yield "satellites" and large-area high-yield fields have emerged continuously for the harvested soybeans. The 154 mu of soybeans in the Guangming No. 2 Cooperative in Linyi County, Shandong Province, achieved an average yield of 1,314 jin and 12 liang per mu after actual harvesting, with 27 mu averaging 4,517 jin per mu, setting a new high-yield record.

The increase in the production of peanuts and sesame, two oil crops, is even more astonishing. It is estimated that the national average yield per mu of over 36 million mu of peanuts will increase by 133.4% compared to last year, reaching approximately 334 jin. The total output will increase by 1.38 times compared to last year, reaching over 120 million dan. The average yield per mu of over 13 million mu of sesame will increase by approximately 130% compared to last year, reaching 101 jin. The total output can reach over 13,900,000 dan, an increase of 124% compared to last year. Many high-yield satellites and large-area high-yield fields have been reported for the peanuts and sesame that have already been harvested in various parts of the south. In Jinjiang Prefecture, Fujian Province, over 260,000 mu of peanuts achieved a yield of 524 jin per mu, an increase of more than two-fold compared to last year. Nanan, Jinjiang and other four counties in this province have also launched ten high-yield "satellites" with yields of over 10,000 jin per mu. The more than one mu of peanut high-yield land cultivated by the Yonghong People's Commune in Hongan County, Hubei Province, has now been harvested, with a yield of 35,423 jin and 12 liang per mu. According to preliminary estimates based on the harvested portions of the 47,000 mu of sesame being harvested in Honghu County, Hubei Province, the average yield per mu can reach over 400 jin. The sesame in Xiaofan Township, Xiangyang County, has already been harvested. The average yield per mu of 1,900 mu of sesame in the township was 1,150 jin, with the yield per unit area of ten mu exceeding 3,000 jin.

    油料作物展翅高飞
    年产量创解放以来最高纪录
    据新华社讯　今年全国油料作物获得丰收。据预计，大豆、花生、油菜、芝麻等四种主要油料作物总产量将达四亿担，比解放后年产量最高的1956年约增加40％，比去年增加50％以上。其他各种油料作物如胡麻、大麻、篦麻、向日葵和苏子等，总产量都将分别比去年增加百分之几十、一倍到几倍。
    夏季收获的油料作物——油菜，今年获得了史无前例的大丰收。据各地实收实打统计，全国三千七百九十二万多亩冬种和春种油菜共收菜籽二千七百六十九万担，比去年增加56％；单位面积产量平均达到七十三斤，比去年增加43％以上。湖北、安徽、上海、河南、内蒙古和广东、江西等省（市）、区平均每亩产量都比去年增加一倍多或接近一倍。去年全国只有四川、甘肃两个油菜百斤省，今年除上述两省外，江苏、青海和新疆维吾尔自治区平均每亩产量也超过了一百斤。另外，据统计，全国亩产菜籽一百斤到二百斤的大面积丰产田共达七百四十八万多亩，亩产二至三百斤的有五十二万九千多亩，四百斤到五百斤的有一千零四十多亩。亩产五百斤以上到二千多斤的高产“卫星”田共达一百九十七亩多。这些大面积丰产田和“卫星”田共占油菜总面积21％以上。
    今年全国共计种植大豆一亿四千多万亩。据预计，全国平均大豆每亩产量将超过去年60％左右达到一百七十二斤，总产量在种植面积比去年减少四千多万亩的情况下，仍将达到二亿五千多万担，超过去年25％。已经收获的大豆，高产“卫星”和大面积丰产田不断出现。山东省临沂县光明二社的一百五十四亩多大豆，经过实收实打，平均亩产达到一千三百一十四斤十二两，其中有二十七亩平均亩产四千五百一十七斤，创造了高产新纪录。
    花生和芝麻这两种油料作物的增产速度更为惊人。据预计，全国三千六百多万亩花生，平均每亩产量将比去年增加133．4％达到三百三十四斤左右，总产量将比去年增加一点三八倍，达到一亿二千多万担。一千三百多万亩芝麻，平均每亩产量将比去年增产130％左右达到一百零一斤，总产量可达一千三百九十多万担，比去年增加124％。南方各地已经收完的花生和芝麻，放出了许多高产卫星和大面积丰产田。福建省晋江专区有二十六万多亩花生，亩产达到五百二十四斤，比去年增产二倍多。这个省南安、晋江等四县还放出了十个亩产万斤以上的高产“卫星”。湖北省红安县永红人民公社培育的一亩多花生丰产地，现已收获，亩产达到三万五千四百二十三斤十二两。湖北省洪湖县正在收获的四万七千多亩芝麻，根据实收部分预计，平均亩产可达四百斤以上。襄阳县小樊乡的芝麻已经收完，全乡一千九百亩芝麻平均亩产一千一百五十斤，其中有十亩单位面积产量超过了三千斤。
