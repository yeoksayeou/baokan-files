Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing, at a gathering held by the CPPCC today, sternly warned U.S. imperialism not to interfere in China's internal affairs in the slightest degree. The members said that Dulles's visit to Taiwan to plot further criminal schemes to occupy Taiwan is bound to meet with complete bankruptcy in the face of 600 million Chinese people.

In their speeches, the members once again solemnly told the military and political personnel in Taiwan that they should be moved by the great cause of the nation, repent sincerely, take the patriotic road, and oppose U.S. imperialism together with the people of the motherland.

In their speeches, the members unanimously expressed their complete support for the Ministry of National Defense's order to resume shelling. Zhang Zhizhong said: During the period of the ceasefire, we kept our word and did not fire a single shot. However, before the extended two-week ceasefire period was over, the Taiwan authorities not only did not repent, but openly violated the conditions of the ceasefire by introducing U.S. warships for escort. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Therefore, we are resuming shelling to punish them, which is completely justified.

Chu Tunan, Chen Qiyou, Wang Jiazhen, Liu Fei, He Guiyan, Xie Nanguang, Wang Shao'ao, Hou Jingru, and others pointed out in their speeches that during our ceasefire period, the Taiwan authorities were stubbornly wrong and clamored to counterattack the mainland, describing our ceasefire as their "victory." This is sheer delusion. We fully support the resumption of shelling to give them a serious lesson and make them wake up.

Chen Qiyou and Liu Fei said that out of humanitarianism and national righteousness, we announced a ceasefire. However, U.S. imperialism saw this as our weakness and even called it their so-called "ceasefire." We can fight when we want to, and stop when we want to. This is a matter of our internal affairs and has nothing to do with the so-called "ceasefire" of U.S. imperialism. They pointed out that today Dulles went to Taiwan, attempting to mend the growing contradictions between the U.S. and Chiang, and plotting new schemes of aggression. Our Minister Peng Dehuai's order to resume shelling is very timely, giving Dulles a resounding slap in the face and making Dulles think clearly.

In their speeches, the members unanimously pointed out that Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu must return to the embrace of the motherland. This is a matter for the Chinese people themselves, and U.S. imperialism is absolutely not allowed to interfere.

Liu Fei, Wang Yunsheng, and others said that we Chinese people will solve our own problems. We will fight U.S. imperialism to the end for interfering in our internal affairs. U.S. imperialism must immediately get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

Chu Tunan said that U.S. imperialism is today occupying the Taiwan and Penghu areas. If it refuses to leave, one day, this U.S. imperialism, which is setting fires everywhere, will burn itself.

In their speeches, the members also hoped that the Taiwan authorities would return from their errant ways. Zhang Zhizhong said that Dulles and his ilk openly scolded the Taiwan authorities for being stupid and unwise. All kinds of actions show that the Taiwan authorities' reliance on U.S. imperialism is actually unreliable. U.S. imperialism will abandon them one day, and even the Taiwan authorities know this. Since the Taiwan authorities know this, they should take the initiative and return to the embrace of the motherland. Wang Yunsheng, Hou Jingru, and others also said that Minister Peng Dehuai's three communiqués and orders are extremely lenient and benevolent to the Taiwan authorities, indicating that the people of the motherland still place hope in them. The Taiwan authorities should understand the greater good and return from their errant ways.

Chu Tunan, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presided over today's gathering.

    政协在京委员严正警告美帝国主义
    不许一丝一毫插手中国内政
    台湾当局应深明大义迷途知返
    新华社21日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会在京的一部分委员，今天在政协举行的集会上，严正警告美帝国主义不得一丝一毫插手中国的内政。委员们说，杜勒斯到台湾策划进一步侵占台湾的罪恶阴谋，定将在六亿中国人民面前遭到彻底破产。
    委员们在发言中还再一次正告台湾军政人员应该在民族大义的感召下，憣然悔悟，走爱国的道路，同祖国人民一起反对美帝国主义。
    委员们在发言中一致表示完全拥护国防部关于恢复炮击的命令。张治中说：在暂停炮击的期间里，我们是说到做到，一炮未发，但是延长暂停炮击两星期的期限还未满，台湾当局不仅不悔悟，竟公然违反暂停炮击的条件，引进美国军舰护航，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，因此，我们恢复炮击来惩罚他们，这完全是应该的。
    楚图南、陈其尤、王家桢、刘斐、贺贵严、谢南光、王绍鏊、侯镜如等在先后发言中指出，在我们暂停炮击期间，台湾当局执迷不悟，并且叫嚣反攻大陆，把我们的暂停炮击说成是他们的“胜利”，这真是瞪着眼睛说梦话，我们完全拥护再开炮，给他们一个严重的教训，让他们清醒一些。
    陈其尤和刘斐说，我们出于人道主义和民族大义，曾宣布暂停炮击，但是美帝国主义把这看做是我们的软弱，还说这就是他们叫嚣的“停火”。我们要打就打，要停就停，这是我们内战中的事情，同美帝国主义所谓“停火”完全无关。他们指出，今天杜勒斯到台湾，企图弥补美蒋之间日益增长的矛盾，并策划新的侵略阴谋，我彭德怀部长恢复炮击的命令，是非常适时的，正好给杜勒斯一个响亮的耳光，让杜勒斯也清醒地想一想。
    委员们在发言中一致指出，台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖一定要回到祖国的怀抱，这是中国人民自己的事，绝对不允许美帝国主义插手。
    刘斐、王芸生等人说，我们中国人自己会解决自己的事，美帝国主义干涉我国内政，我们要和它斗争到底，美帝国主义必须立即从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去。
    楚图南说，美帝国主义今天霸占着台湾、澎湖地区，如果它赖着不走，总有一天，这个到处放火的美帝国主义会引火自焚。
    委员们在发言中还希望台湾当局迷途知返。张治中说，杜勒斯之流竟公然骂台湾当局愚蠢、不明智，种种行动都说明台湾当局投靠美帝国主义实际上是不可靠的，美帝国主义总有一天会抛弃他们，这一点就连台湾当局也是知道的。台湾当局既然知道这一点，那么就应该争取主动，回到祖国怀抱。王芸生、侯镜如等人还说，彭德怀部长的三个文告和命令，对台湾当局是宽大之至、仁至义尽，这是表示祖国人民对他们还是寄以希望的。台湾当局应深明大义，迷途知返。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员楚图南主持今天的集会。
