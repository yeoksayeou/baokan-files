    We Remember Our Friends in West Asia and Africa
    Zhang Tiesheng, Head of the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe
    In August 1957, the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe went abroad in two groups to visit Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Africa. They returned to China in May 1958, for a total of nine months.
    At that time, American imperialism was continuing to push the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, invading the Middle East, and instigating Turkey to attack Syria. The smell of gunpowder could be smelled on the Turkish-Syrian border. At the same time, French imperialism was still using airplanes and artillery to suppress the armed struggle of the Algerian people at all costs, and Tunisia and Morocco were also threatened. Therefore, when we arrived in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Africa, the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist wave in this region was constantly rising, and the movement to strive for national independence or safeguard national independence was developing vigorously.
    We were universally welcomed by the people everywhere in the six countries. Many young people, students, and cultural figures came to us to ask for autographs and exchange contact addresses. The deep hatred of the people of the six countries for American, British, and French imperialism formed a strong contrast with their deep friendship for the people of New China.
    The Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe not only made many friends abroad, but also, in addition to introducing Chinese acrobatics to a wide audience in each country, learned the excellent arts of these countries' nations from their cultural and artistic circles. This is of great significance in international friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges.
    From Syria through Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco to Ghana, we stayed for a total of two hundred and twenty-three days and performed two hundred and nine shows. In the six countries, since this was the first time we introduced the acrobatics of New China, the audience was over 330,000 people. In Beirut and Tunis, one in ten residents had seen the performance; in Kumasi and Accra, Ghana, one in six; and in the stadium of Aleppo, Syria, there were as many as 8,000 people in the last show. The cultural and press circles of various countries believed that our performance was an unprecedented event in their cultural life, and no foreign performance group had ever had such a grand occasion in their country.
    Precisely because we introduced the acrobatics of New China for the first time in the six countries, the audience understood the national characteristics of the acrobatic art of New China through this popular and artistic acrobatics. The vice chairman of the Tunisian Red Crescent Society, Suidongm, said that our performance had conquered the hearts of the Tunisians. A Catholic monk in Lebanon said that he saw the most beautiful things in the world in a dream. Many audiences in Beirut often waited at the theater entrance for the actors to shake hands and congratulate them. After watching the performance, even the right-wing figures who usually attacked New China turned around and praised it unanimously. Newspapers and periodicals in various countries published many comments praising our performances, and they believed that we were cultural envoys of peace and friendship.
    In Egypt, when we held the opening ceremony, President Nasser personally sent a representative to participate, along with eight ministers. It is said that this was unprecedented in Egypt. In Syria, Prime Minister Asali and ministers of various ministries watched the performance. Tunisian President Bourguiba and his wife watched the charity performance hosted by the Red Crescent Society. During the break, Bourguiba personally went to the backstage to shake hands with the actors one by one to congratulate them on the success of the performance. When we arrived in Rabat, King Mohammed V of Morocco first requested us to perform for his whole family in the palace. In Ghana, Prime Minister Nkrumah and his wife watched the performance separately. All the ministers of Ghana had watched the performance, and some ministers had even watched it two or three times.
    We have also performed several times for the Egyptian and Syrian armies who bravely resisted imperialist aggression and resolutely defended national independence. We arrived in Damascus when American imperialism was plotting to invade Syria. The Syrian people believed that we supported them politically. At the request of the Syrian side, we performed four shows for the Syrian army in Damascus and on the border. The enthusiastic cheers of the officers and soldiers are still deeply imprinted in our minds. Similarly, at the request of the Egyptian side, we also performed four shows for the Egyptian army in Cairo, Alexandria, and Ismailia, which was greatly welcomed by them. At the grand reception to entertain us, they solemnly played the national anthems of China and Egypt. After leaving Ismailia, we rushed to Port Said to perform three shows for the Egyptian people who bravely resisted the British and French aggressors during the anniversary week of the Egyptian victory, and laid wreaths on the martyrs' cemetery in Port Said.
    In various countries, we have also paid attention to the demands of children, young people, and students. We have performed one or two shows for them in each place. It is particularly worth pointing out the performances for the students of Cairo University and Alexandria University in Egypt, because they not only crowded the theater, but also kept applauding, cheering, and even stamping their feet.
    During our visit and performance, in addition to the Egyptian Victory Anniversary Week mentioned above, we also participated in the Damascus International Fair and the Arab Lawyers' Congress in Syria with performance activities, and the Ghana First Independence Day and the African Independent States Conference in Ghana.
    Due to the success of the performance, the Damascus International Fair awarded our group a gold medal and a certificate of merit. Later, our group also won a silver medal from the Egyptian government in Egypt, which was awarded at the National Meritorious Personnel Award Ceremony held in Alexandria.
    After watching our performances, the audiences of the six countries not only recognized a traditional art of New China, but also felt the development and strength of New China, the progress and happiness of the people of New China, and at the same time recognized that the Chinese people love peace. Syrian People's Party member of parliament Bo Zuo praised the achievements of New China and was proud to have the people of New China as friends. Shabo Ni, Director of the Education Department of Aleppo Province, even used ingenious and exquisitely embroidered flowers to describe the friendship between the people of Syria and China. Cairo Art Bureau Director Haki repeatedly praised the new face of the Chinese people. We encountered similar situations in Tunisia and Morocco. Moroccan Minister of Education Fassi hoped that the people of Morocco and China could carry out cultural exchanges while watching the performance. The people of Ghana did not understand New China originally, but soon after, they enthusiastically waved to us when they met us, believing that we were their best friends.
    When we were about to leave Syria, we were honored to attend the official establishment of the Syrian-Chinese Friendship Association. When we were about to leave Tunisia, we participated in the Chinese Arts and Crafts and Photo Exhibition held by the Tunisian-Chinese Friendship Association. At these two enthusiastic meetings, we not only recognized the importance of friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of various countries, but also felt that the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various countries will be further consolidated and developed through mutual friendly exchanges and cultural exchanges.
    We have made many friends in the six countries. Now that we have returned to our motherland, we deeply miss them. We wish that in the years to come, the Chinese people and the people of these countries will further promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two sides.

    我们怀念着西亚和非洲的朋友
    中国杂技艺术团团长　张铁生
    1957年8月，中国杂技艺术团分两批出国在中东、北非和西非先后访问了叙利亚、埃及、黎巴嫩、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳六个国家，1958年5月回国，为时共九个月。
    当时美帝国主义正在中东继续推行艾森豪威尔主义，侵略中东，而且策动土耳其向叙利亚进攻，在土叙边境上可以嗅到火药气。同时法帝国主义仍不顾一切地以飞机、大炮来镇压阿尔及利亚人民的武装斗争，突尼斯和摩洛哥也受到威胁。因此，在我们到达中东、北非及西非的时候，这个地区的反帝、反殖民主义的浪潮正在不断地高涨，争取民族独立或维护民族独立的运动正在蓬勃地发展。
    我们在六国中到处受到人民的普遍欢迎。到处有很多青年、学生和文化界人士找我们签名，交换通信处。六国人民对于美英法帝国主义的深仇宿恨同他们对于新中国人民的深情厚谊适成一极强烈的对照。
    中国杂技艺术团在国外不仅结交了不少朋友，并且每到一国除去在广大的观众面前介绍中国的杂技外，还向这些国家的文化艺术界，学习他们民族的优秀的艺术。这在国际间的友好往来和文化交流上都是饶有意义的。
    我们从叙利亚经过埃及、黎巴嫩、突尼斯、摩洛哥到加纳，一共勾留了二百二十三天，演出了二百零九场。在六国中，由于我们这次是第一次介绍新中国的杂技，观众约在三十三万人以上。在贝鲁特和突尼斯市，看过演出的居民，十人中有一人，在加纳的库马西和大戈拉底，六人中有一人；在叙利亚阿勒颇的运动场上，最后一场竟有八千人之多。各国文化、新闻界认为我们的演出是他们文化生活上一种空前的举动，还没有一个外国演出团体在他们国内有过这样的盛况。
    正由于我们在六国中第一次介绍新中国的杂技，观众们通过这种通俗化而又艺术化的杂技，了解了新中国的具有民族特色的杂技艺术。突尼斯红新月会副主席绥顿姆说，我们的演出已经征服了突尼斯人的心。黎巴嫩的一个天主教修道士说，他是在幻梦中看到了世界上最美丽的东西。贝鲁特的很多观众都常在剧场门口等待演员们要向他们握手道贺。看过了演出，甚至连平时攻击新中国的右派人物也转而一致称赞。各国报刊都发表了许多评论来赞扬我们的演出，它们认为我们是和平友好的文化使者。
    在埃及，当我们举行开幕式时，纳赛尔总统曾亲自派代表参加，同时参加的还有八位部长，据说这在埃及是空前的。在叙利亚，阿萨利总理和各部部长都看过演出。突尼斯总统布尔吉巴及其夫人看了红新月会主持的义演，布尔吉巴在休息时还亲自到后台同演员一一握手，祝贺他们演出的成功。当我们到了拉巴特以后，摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世首先要求我们到王宫为他全家演出一次。在加纳，恩克鲁玛总理及其夫人分别看了演出。加纳所有的部长都看过演出，有些部长甚至看过两三次。
    我们也曾为英勇抵抗帝国主义侵略、坚决捍卫民族独立的埃、叙军队演出过几次。我们在美帝国主义策动侵略叙利亚的时候到达了大马士革，叙利亚人民认为我们不啻在政治上支持了他们。由于叙方的要求，我们先后在大马士革、在边境为叙军演出了四场，当时军官们和士兵们的热情欢呼一直到现在还非常深刻地印在我们的脑海中。同样由于埃方的要求，我们在开罗、亚历山大及伊斯美利亚也为埃军演出了四场，这大大受到他们的欢迎，他们在招待我们的盛大招待会上曾庄严地奏出中埃两国的国歌。我们在离开伊斯美利亚以后又借埃及胜利周年纪念周的机会赶到塞得港为英勇抗击英法侵略者的埃及人民演出了三场，并在塞得港烈士墓上献了花圈。
    我们在各国还注意到儿童们、青年们和学生们的要求，每到一地，都曾为他们演出了一两场，其中特别值得指出的是为埃及开罗大学、亚历山大大学的学生进行的演出，因为他们不仅把剧场挤得水泄不通，而且不断地鼓掌、喝采、甚至继之以跺足。
    在我们访问演出期间，除去上面已经提过的埃及胜利周年纪念周外，我们还以演出活动在叙利亚参加过大马士革国际博览会、阿拉伯律师代表大会，在加纳参加过加纳第一届独立节，非洲独立国家会议。
    由于演出的成功，大马士革国际博览会曾颁给我团一个金质奖章和一道奖状，其后我团在埃及也获得了埃及政府的一个银质奖章，这是他们在亚历山大举行的国家有功人员授勋大会上颁发的。
    六国观众们在看过我们的演出以后，不但认识了新中国的一种传统的艺术，而且由此感觉到新中国的发展和强大，新中国人民的进步和幸福，同时认识到中国人民是热爱和平的。叙利亚人民党议员波佐盛赞新中国的成就，以有新中国人民为友而自豪。阿勒颇省教育厅长沙波尼甚至用巧夺天工、精美编绣的花朵来形容叙中两国人民的友谊。开罗艺术局长哈基一再称道中国人民的新面貌。我们在突尼斯和摩洛哥曾遇到类似的情况。摩洛哥教育部长法西在看演出时希望摩洛哥和中国两国人民能进行文化交流。加纳人民本来是不了解新中国的，但不久以后，他们一碰到我们就热情地招手，认为我们是他们最好的朋友。
    当我们快要离开叙利亚的时候，我们曾以叙中友协的举行正式成立大会而躬逢其盛，当我们快要离开突尼斯的时候，我们又参加了突中友协举行的中国工艺品及图片展览会。在这两个热情洋溢的会上，我们不仅认识到中国人民和各国人民的友好往来和文化交流的重要性，而且感觉到中国人民和各国人民之间的友谊将以相互间的友好往来和文化交流而获得进一步的巩固和发展。
    我们在六国中结交了不少朋友，现在我们虽回到了祖国，但我们深深怀念着他们。我们预祝在未来的岁月中中国人民和这些国家的人民将会进一步促进双方之间的互相了解和友谊。
