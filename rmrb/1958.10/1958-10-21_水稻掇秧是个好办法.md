This year, Ma Cheng County has adopted a new farming system in rice production: large-scale transplanting and hill consolidation. Facts have proven that transplanting is an advanced experience that can fully realize the potential for increased production.

I. Transplanting Borrows Land and Promotes Tiller Development, with Great Potential for Increased Production

After the Jian’guo People’s Commune transplanted early rice, there was a surplus of seedlings. Some people said the seedlings were too old and advocated throwing them away; others thought it was a pity to throw them away and suggested finding some fields to temporarily plant them. Later, people planted the extra seedlings in the empty fields prepared for late japonica rice, totaling nine mu of land. As the summer solstice approached, it was time to transplant the late japonica rice. At this time, the early rice planted in the late japonica fields had already completed tillering and the young panicles had formed. They then uprooted all the early rice seedlings from these fields and transplanted them into one mu of land, resulting in a harvest of more than 36,900 jin of early rice. The land freed up by transplanting was immediately planted with late japonica rice. The late japonica rice is now growing well and is expected to produce more than 2,000 jin. The success of transplanting not only played a huge role in the early rice harvest and high yield, but more importantly, it provided people with a trick for even greater harvests next year. This method opened up a broad avenue for increasing grain production. We calculated that this year our county planted 200,000 mu of single-season late japonica rice. The transplanting period for single-season late rice is at the summer solstice, and the transplanting period for early rice is at Guyu (Grain Rain). There are sixty days between Guyu and the summer solstice, which is a gap for late japonica rice. If this gap is utilized to plant early rice in the 200,000 mu of late japonica fields, even if planted sparsely, it can complete tillering and development in forty days. Then, the early rice that has completed tillering and development can be uprooted and transplanted into a small area of land, and the freed-up large fields can be planted with single-season late japonica rice. This is equivalent to borrowing 200,000 mu of land to cultivate early rice seedlings, increasing the nutritional area of early rice, and increasing its yield, without affecting the normal growth of single-season late japonica rice. By adopting the transplanting method, early rice, middle rice, or single-season late japonica rice can be combined together after the early rice is about to mature and the single-season late japonica rice, middle rice, etc., have tillered but before the stem elongates. The land can then be freed up to plant double-season rice, which can achieve even higher yields. This is a valuable discovery for Macheng, which has both hilly and mountainous areas, to plant double-season rice, compete for grain with time, and harvest an extra season!

It seems that the more transplanting is done, the more production increases, as long as there is labor. But its significance is not simply for launching high-yield "satellites"; its important significance is that it can use time to expand the cultivated area, increase the multiple cropping index, and ensure more grain production. Therefore, next year, based on the labor situation, we plan to borrow 100,000 mu of late japonica fields to cultivate early rice seedlings in addition to the 300,000 mu that should be planted with early rice, and consolidate 100,000 mu of middle rice. In this way, although our county has 640,000 mu of paddy fields, the planting area can be expanded to 840,000 mu, while the harvested area is still 640,000 mu. Doesn’t this mean producing rice from 200,000 mu of extra fields? If we further plant early-maturing early rice earlier, so that the early rice matures in mid-to-late June; then transplant late-maturing early rice, so that it matures in late July; and then transplant late-maturing middle rice, so that it matures in late August; and then transplant double-season rice at the end of August. In this way, it is entirely possible for one mu of land in the Macheng plain area to grow rice four times a year. Therefore, transplanting borrows land and promotes tiller development for seedling cultivation, which is a good method for increasing production.

II. The Function of Transplanting and the Appropriate Time

According to our field observations, the development of rice roots is a continuous process of metabolism. Especially from the differentiation of young panicles to before booting, the seedlings need gradually increasing nutrients. The originally growing root system gradually weakens and cannot adapt to the needs of reproductive growth. The old roots die, but a large number of new roots and adventitious roots are produced, absorbing a large amount of nutrients and enhancing the growth potential of the rice. If we seize this link to transplant and apply a fast-acting chemical fertilizer five or six days before transplanting, and the transplanted field is newly deep-plowed and fertilized sufficiently, the seedlings will grow in another new environment. In this way, due to the relationship of metabolism, more new roots can grow, absorb more fertilizer, greatly increase the nutrients needed for seedling growth and development, the “ganjiao diao” (referring to awned rice) will grow quickly, and empty shells will be greatly reduced, correspondingly increasing yield.

After the seedlings grow in paddy fields for a long period of time, the growth potential of the rice weakens in the later stage due to excessive consumption of fertilizers in the soil, and many tillers become ineffective. According to our investigation, this ineffective tillering accounts for about 20%-30%. After consolidating the hills and transplanting, the seedlings grow in fields with loose soil, plenty of water, and sufficient fertilizer. The original ineffective tillers grow into yellow, heavy ears of rice.

During the period of temporary planting, the increased nutritional area of the plants due to decentralized large-area cultivation allows the rice young panicles to differentiate, forming the conditions for long awns and grains. After transplanting, the young panicles obtain a large amount of nutrients, the grains develop well, the pollination rate is high, the filling and yellowing are fast, there are many seeds, the awned seeds are large, and the thousand-grain weight is greatly increased.

Based on the above observations, we believe that transplanting has the effect of promoting enhanced rice growth potential. This year, our county had 534,000 mu of early, middle, and late rice, and the yield of the transplanted and consolidated hills was generally one to two times higher than that of large-field transplanting, with the highest being 100,000 jin and 200,000 jin per mu.

In our county, most of the transplanting has been successful, but some have failed. From the perspective of many successful places, it is best to transplant after the stalks have developed, the young panicles have formed, and just when they are about to boot (pregnant ear). Therefore, the transplanting time should be strictly controlled to within a few days after the completion of tillering, the formation of young panicles, and the beginning of the transition to reproductive growth. However, transplanting should not be carried out in the later stage of pregnancy, let alone during the heading stage. Because during this period, the rice seedlings are tall, the original roots are broken, and the new roots cannot grow in time. Water and fertilizer cannot supply the growth of the plants, which will not only fail to increase production, but will also cause a large reduction in production. The rice in some of our fields that was transplanted during the heading stage mostly produced white awns.

III. Transplanting Techniques Should Be Mastered

Transplanting is the planting of large seedlings, which requires stricter technical requirements than planting young seedlings. When transplanting, it is especially important to precisely and carefully prepare the fields, ensuring that the mud is deep, fine, and fertile; the seedlings must not be damaged or broken when taking and transporting them; they must be planted deeply and upright, one plant at a time; transplanting should not be carried out when the sun is too strong or the weather is too hot, but should be carried out in the early morning, evening, at night, or on cloudy and rainy days.

The density of transplanting should be based on specific requirements. In order to cultivate high yields, specially trained personnel are organized for management, and the transplanting can be dense, generally planting 700 to 800 seedlings per square foot. If the transplanting is carried out to expand the cultivated area, the area should not be transplanted too densely, because there is no labor to manage it, and the densely planted seedlings will rot. According to the experience of large-area transplanting in various places, it is best to transplant three to five mu of seedlings into one mu of land. The seedlings transplanted in this way can still obtain normal ventilation and light, and there are only benefits and no disadvantages in terms of seedling growth and development.

Transplanting is the transplantation of rice cultivated on a large area onto a small plot of land, which increases the plant density per unit area. In order to ensure the growth and development of the seedlings after dense transplanting, the base fertilizer should be applied sufficiently at one time, preferably more fast-acting fertilizer, as well as faster-acting fertilizer. Generally, 500 dan of old brick soil, 71,000 jin of manure (soil bubble?) are applied per mu, and attention should also be paid to applying more cinder ash phosphorus fertilizer and some lime.

Water is the blood of rice growth. Water management after transplanting must not involve drying the fields, and at least the fields must be kept moist, preferably with a layer of water constantly irrigated to help the rapid growth of new roots and the absorption of a large amount of nutrients after transplanting, and to promote the recovery of seedling growth.

This year, our county's agricultural production has taken a big leap forward compared with the past, and the total grain output has doubled compared with last year. Next year, with transplanting technology and other measures, we plan to double the grain output again on the basis of this year's output, and strive to make rice a 5,000 to 10,000 jin county.

    水稻掇秧是个好办法
    麻城县委书记处书记　赵金良
    麻城县今年在水稻生产上，采取了一种新的耕作制度：大量掇秧并丘。事实证明，掇秧是一种能充分发挥增产潜力的先进经验。
    一、掇秧借田发蔸，增产潜力很大
    建国一社在早稻插秧后，多出一部分秧苗。有人说秧老了，主张将秧摔掉；有人认为摔了可惜，还是找些田寄插一下好些。后来人们就把多余的秧苗插到准备插晚粳的空田里去，共计插上了九亩田。快到夏至，一季晚粳田要开始插秧了，这时借田插在晚粳田的早稻，分蘖已完毕，幼穗已形成。他们又将这些田的早稻秧苗，全部扯起来，插在一亩田里去，结果收了早稻三万六千九百多斤。掇秧替出来的田，立即全部插上一季晚粳。现在晚粳生长也很好，预计能产二千斤以上。掇秧成功，不仅是对早稻丰收、高产起了巨大作用，更重要的是使人们对明年的更大丰收，找到了窍门。这个办法开辟了广阔的粮食增产门路。我们算了一下账，我县今年种了二十万亩一季晚粳，一季晚稻插秧期在夏至，早稻插秧期在谷雨，谷雨到夏至中间有六十天，对晚粳来说是一个空隙，如果把这个空隙利用起来，在二十万亩晚粳田先插上早稻，甚至插稀些，它有四十天就能完成分蘖发育，然后将完成分蘖发育后的早稻，全部扯起来，并丘插在小面积的田里，替出来的大田，再插上一季晚粳。这等于借二十万亩田培育早稻缺苗，增加早稻营养面积，提高其产量，而又不影响一季晚粳的正常生长。采取掇秧方法，还可以在早稻将成熟、一季晚粳、中稻等已分蘖后、圆秆前，将早稻、中稻或一季晚粳并在一起，替出田来插二季稻，二季稻更能获得高产。这对兼有丘陵区、山区的麻城，种植双季稻，与时间争粮，多收一季，是多么宝贵的一个发现啊！
    掇秧只要有劳力，看来并的越多，增产也越多。但它决不是单纯为放高产“卫星”的一个意义；它的重要意义是可以利用时间来扩大耕地面积，增加复种指数，保证粮食多增产。因此明年我们根据劳力情况，打算除应插早稻面积三十万亩外，还借晚粳田培育早稻秧苗十万亩，中稻并丘十万亩。这样我县虽是六十四万亩水田，但插秧面积就能扩大到八十四万亩了，而收获面积还是六十四万亩。这不就多产二十万亩田的水稻吗？如果我们进一步早插早熟早稻，使早稻在6月中、下旬成熟；掇上迟熟早稻，使它在7月下旬成熟；再掇迟熟中稻，使它8月下旬成熟；在8月底再掇二季稻。这样，麻城平畈地区一亩田一年栽四次水稻，是完全可能的。所以说，掇秧借田发蔸育苗，是一个增产的好方法。
    二、掇秧的作用和恰当时间
    据我们田间观察，水稻根系的发育，是不断地进行着新陈代谢。特别是从幼穗分化起到打苞前，秧苗需要养分逐渐增加，原来生长的根群逐渐老弱，不能适应生殖生长的需要，老根走向死亡，但又产生大批的新根和不定根，吸收大量养分，增强水稻的生长势。如果抓住这个环节进行掇秧，并在掇秧前五、六天追一次速效化学肥料，掇秧的田从新深翻整田，下足肥料，秧苗又生长在另一个新的环境中，这样，由于新陈代谢的关系，就能长出更多的新根，吸收更多的肥料，大大增加了秧苗生长发育所需要的养分，“赶脚刁”就会很快的长起来，疪壳就可大大减少，相应地增加产量。
    秧苗在水田中经过一段长期间生长后，由于土壤中的肥料消耗过大，因而稻谷后期生长势减弱，分蘖多成无效。这种无效分蘖，据我们调查约占20％—30％。通过并丘掇秧后，秧苗生长在土松、水多、肥分足的田中，原来的无效分蘖却长成黄甸甸的稻穗了。
    在寄秧期间，由于分散大面积培育，增加植株的营养面积，使水稻幼穗分化，形成刁长粒多的穗子条件，掇秧后幼穗得到大量养分，谷粒发育好，受粉率高，灌浆、黄熟快，籽子多，刁籽大，千粒重大大增加。
    综合上面观察，我们认为掇秧有促进水稻生长势增强的作用。今年我县早、中、晚稻有五十三万四千亩，实行并丘掇秧，一般产量比大田插秧产量高出一、二倍，最高的有亩产十万斤、二十万斤的。
    我县掇秧，大都是成功的，也有失败的。从许多成功的地方来看，在发株完成后，幼穗已形成，刚刚要打苞（孕穗）时进行掇秧的为最好。因此掇秧时间，应严格掌握在分蘖完成后、幼穗形成、转向生殖生长开始后几日内进行。但掇秧不宜在孕穗后期进行，更不能在抽穗期进行。因为在这个期间掇秧，禾苗高大，原根扯断，新根一时又长不及，水肥不能供应植株的生长，不但不能增产，而且会造成大量减产。我们有些田的谷，在抽穗期掇的秧，结果大都出了白刁子。
    三、应该掌握掇秧技术
    掇秧就是插大株秧，比插嫩秧的技术要求严格一些。在掇秧时，特别要确切精细整好田，做到泥深、细烂、田肥；取苗运秧决不能破禾断苗；插时要一株一株的插深扶正；太阳太毒、天气过热时不能掇秧，要在早晚夜间或阴雨天掇秧。
    掇秧的密度，都要从具体要求出发。为了培育高产，组织了专人管理，可以掇密，一般每平方市尺插七、八百根苗。如果是为了扩大耕地面积实行掇秧的，这个面积不宜掇得过密，因为没有劳力来管理，过密秧会烂掉的。根据各地大面积掇秧的经验，最好是三至五亩秧苗掇一亩田。这样掇的秧，仍能获得正常的通风透光，在秧苗生长发育上，只有好处没有坏处。
    掇秧是将大面积栽培的水稻移栽在小块的土地上，这样增加了单位面积的植株密度。为了保证掇密后秧苗的生长发育，底肥应当一次下足，最好多下速效肥料，兼下较迅速性肥料，一般每亩下陈砖土五百担、厩肥（土泡?）七万一千斤，还应注意多下火灰磷肥和部分石灰。
    水是水稻生长的血液。掇秧后水的管理，决不能晒田，起码要保持湿润，最好是经常灌上一层水，帮助掇秧后迅速生长新根和大量吸收养分，促进秧苗恢复生长。
    我县今年农业生产比过去大跃进了一步，粮食总产量比去年翻了一番。明年，我们有了掇秧技术和其它的措施，粮食产量打算在今年基础上，再翻他一番，水稻向五千到万斤县来奋斗。
