Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 16th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Anshan Steel) steelmaking workers are working hard to catch up, striving to match the national leading level of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 in terms of open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient in a short period of time, and plant the red flag in front of Anshan Steel's open-hearth furnaces.

In the "Strive for Advancement, Seize the Red Flag" competition, the open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient of Anshan Steel's steelmaking plants has greatly increased. Daily output in September was more than 2,000 tons higher than in August, and in the first ten days of October, it was more than 800 tons higher than in September.

Starting in September, Anshan Steel's steelmaking plants universally launched a "Learn from Shanghai, Surpass Shanghai" campaign, greatly leveraging people's subjective initiative. Open-hearth furnaces have increased their charge volume, and smelting time has generally been shortened by more than an hour. Ingot casting, transportation, raw materials and other workers have put forward the slogan "Everything for the open-hearth furnace." Workers at the Metallurgical Furnace Repair Plant also proposed to use the spirit of Sun Wukong crossing the Flaming Mountains to rush to repair open-hearth furnaces. Sometimes, as soon as the open-hearth furnace finishes tapping the steel, they jump into the red-hot furnace to tear down bricks. Open-hearth furnaces that used to take more than 100 hours to repair can now be repaired in just over 60 hours. The time saved in repairing furnaces in September alone can increase steel production by nearly 6,000 tons.

While absorbing the advanced experience of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 and other fraternal steel plants, Anshan Steel's steelmaking plants have also demonstrated originality, adopting many revolutionary measures that break with conventions. Not long ago, the First Steelmaking Plant boldly adopted the method of adding pig iron and increasing carbon in steelmaking. After testing on four open-hearth furnaces in the first ten days of October, it increased steel production by more than 4,000 tons.

In October, nine large open-hearth furnaces at Anshan Steel have set a target of producing 1,000 tons per day with a utilization coefficient of 15 to 17. Leading the way is the No. 16 open-hearth furnace, which once created a new record for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces. In the first ten days of the month, its utilization coefficient has reached 12.85. The steelmaking workers are determined to catch up with the most advanced national level in a short period of time.

    鞍钢猛追上钢三厂
    据新华社鞍山16日电　鞍钢炼钢工人正在紧追猛赶，要争取短时期内在平炉利用系数方面赶上全国最先进的上钢三厂，将红旗插在鞍钢炼钢炉前。
    在“争上游、夺红旗”的竞赛中，鞍钢各炼钢厂的平炉利用系数有了很大提高。日产量9月份比8月份多二千多吨，10月上旬又比9月份多八百多吨。
    鞍钢各炼钢厂从9月份开始就普遍展开“学上钢、超上钢”的运动，大大发挥了人的主观能动性。平炉扩大了装入量，熔炼时间也普遍缩短了一个多小时。铸锭、运转、原料等工人，提出了“一切为了平炉”的口号。冶金炉修理厂的工人们，也提出要拿孙悟空过火焰山的精神来抢修平炉，有时平炉刚出完钢，他们就跳进通红的炉内去扒砖。过去需要一百多小时才能中修一次的平炉，现在只要六十多小时，仅9月份在修炉中节约的时间就能增产近六千吨钢。
    鞍钢各炼钢厂在吸收上钢三厂和其他兄弟钢厂先进经验的同时，还发挥了独创精神，采用了许多打破清规戒律的革命性措施。第一炼钢厂不久前大胆采用了兑铁水增炭炼钢法，10月上旬在四座平炉上试验后，增产了四千多吨钢。
    10月份，在鞍钢已有九座大平炉订出日产千吨、利用系数达到十五到十七的计划。跑在前面的是曾经创造了大型平炉快速炼钢新纪录的十六号平炉，上旬它的利用系数已经达到十二点八五。炼钢工人们决心一定要在不长的时间内赶上全国最先进的水平。
