    Resolutely Implement the "Constitution" of Agricultural Production
    Yongji County Pulls Out Ideological White Flags, Deep Plowing Movement Reaches Climax

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Yongji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, resolutely implemented the "Constitution" of agricultural production, and led the vast number of party members, cadres, and people in the county to launch a struggle between two roads on the issue of deep plowing, pulled out the white flags, and planted the red flags, and a climax of deep plowing appeared throughout the county.

    When Comrade Deng Xiaoping inspected Yongji County, Jilin, he gave instructions on the county's agricultural production next year, requiring that the average person reach 3,000 jin of grain and an income of 300 yuan. In order to implement Comrade Xiaoping's instructions, the Yongji County Party Committee held a broadcast conference with the participation of cadres and the broad masses of the people throughout the county, and proposed to deeply plow all 170,000 hectares of land in the county this autumn, and organized hundreds of cadres from county-level agencies and people's commune leaders above the group leader level in 30 townships to launch discussions. During the discussion, everyone was in high spirits, and many people expressed that they would resolutely complete the deep plowing task. However, because there were many discussions and plans at that time, and the right-leaning conservative ideology was not thoroughly criticized, the resistance encountered in action was very serious. In Wulihezi Township, there were more than 130 production teams. During the ten days after the task was assigned, only more than 100 hectares were plowed, averaging less than one mu per production team per day. The main reason for the slow progress was that some cadres did not understand the idea. It is estimated that half of the party branch secretaries and directors in the work area did not understand the idea, and they held a perfunctory attitude. 70% of the production team leaders did not understand the idea. This situation also existed in other townships.

    The struggle between revolutionary spirit and conservative ideology on the issue of deep plowing is widespread. This struggle also hides the struggle between two roads. Wang De, the director of the Qixin Cooperative in Gangyao Town, took the position of a wealthy middle peasant and had a resistant attitude towards the grain issue and worked passively. He was responsible for the piece of land where grass seedlings grew together in summer, and he did not organize the members to seize the time to hoe; he was not active in fighting drought, and he did not care about the current deep plowing, and he did not even know the general situation. Diao Deji, the production team leader of the Shuihu Work Area in Chundenghe Township, did not lead the members to plow the land, but went to sell steamed buns. Han Wengui (a wealthy middle peasant), the twelfth team leader of the Weitanggou Work Area, was called the "hands-behind-the-back team leader" by the members. He did not seize the time to harvest in autumn, and he was also perfunctory about deep plowing. These cadres actually became representatives of the capitalist tendencies of wealthy middle peasants.

    In order to erect red flags on the agricultural production front and win the victory of deep plowing, all 30 townships in the county generally held two three- to five-hundred-person cadre criticism and debate meetings from late September to early October, pulling out some white flags, commending activists, and refuting the "habit theory" and "condition theory." People like the "hands-behind-the-back team leader" Han Wengui were removed from their leadership positions, and people who resolutely supported the party's policies became leaders of the masses. A great debate was also launched among the masses. The masses in Wulajie Town posted more than 200 big-character posters against the wealthy middle peasant Han Junping. After the white flag was pulled down, the suppressed construction enthusiasm of the broad masses turned into soaring energy. After the members of the twelfth team of the Weitanggou Work Area dismissed Team Leader Han Wengui from his post, they immediately harnessed seven plows to plow the land that day.

    On this basis, the county party committee put forward five specific requirements and measures for deep plowing, and specifically helped each township to make arrangements. From October 6th to 15th, and from October 16th to 25th, it was divided into two stages, set the daily progress, and determined that the county party committee and the inspection team would conduct acceptance on the last day of each stage to ensure that the deep plowing task for the entire county would be basically completed by the end of October. At the same time, it was proposed that labor organization should be militarized, action should be combatized, and life should be collectivized.

    After this series of work, the situation of slow deep plowing progress was reversed. The county had deeply plowed a total of 6,058 hectares of land before October 4, and on October 5 alone, 4,265 hectares were plowed. As long as we continue to work hard, the deep plowing of the county's land can be realized. (Attached picture)

### 坚决执行农业生产“宪法”  永吉县拔掉思想白旗，深耕运动出现高潮

    坚决执行农业生产“宪法”
    永吉县拔掉思想白旗，深耕运动出现高潮
    本报讯　中共永吉县委根据邓小平同志的指示，坚决贯彻农业生产的“宪法”，领导全县广大党员、干部和人民群众，就深耕问题开展了两条道路的斗争，拔掉了白旗，插上了红旗，全县出现了深耕高潮。
    邓小平同志到吉林永吉县视察时，对这个县明年农业生产作了指示，要求每人平均要达到三千斤粮食，收入三百元钱。永吉县委为了贯彻小平同志这一指示，召开了有全县干部和广大人民群众参加的广播大会，提出了要在今年秋天把全县十七万公顷土地全部深耕的号召，并且组织县直属机关干部和三十个乡镇人民公社组长以上的几百名干部展开了讨论。在讨论中大家心情振奋，不少人表示要坚决完成深耕任务。但是，由于当时讨论规划较多，对右倾保守思想批判得不彻底，所以在行动上遇到的抵触情绪是很严重的。五里河子乡共有一百三十多个生产队，在任务布置下去后的十天期间，只翻了一百多公顷，平均每个生产队一天还没翻上一亩地。进度迟缓的主要原因是有些干部思想不通。据估计，在作业区党支部书记和主任中间，思想不通的人有一半，他们抱应付态度。在生产队长中思想不通的有70％。这种情况在其他乡镇也同样存在。
    在深耕问题上革命精神和保守思想的斗争是普遍存在着的。在这个斗争中也隐藏着两条道路的斗争。缸窑镇齐心社主任王德，站在富裕中农的立场上，对粮食问题有抵触情绪，工作消极。他分工负责的片，夏季地里草苗齐长，他也不组织社员抓紧铲趟；抗旱时他也不积极，对目前的深耕更是不加过问，连一般情况也不知道。春登河乡水浒作业区生产队长刁德基，不领导社员翻地，而去卖馒头。苇塘沟作业区十二队长韩文贵（富裕中农），社员称他是“倒背手队长”，秋收不抓紧，对深耕也应付。这些干部实际上成了富裕中农资本主义倾向的代表。
    为了在农业生产战线上树起红旗，取得深耕的胜利，全县三十个乡镇从9月下旬到10月上旬普遍举行两次三、五百人的干部鸣放辩论会，拔掉了一些白旗，表扬了积极分子，驳倒了“习惯论”和“条件论”。“倒背手队长”韩文贵那样的人被从领导岗位上撤换下来，坚决拥护党的政策的人当上了群众的领导者。在群众中也展开了大辩论，乌拉街镇的群众给富裕中农韩俊平贴了二百多张大字报。白旗被拔掉后，广大群众被压抑着的建设热情变成了冲天的干劲。苇塘沟作业区十二队的社员们，在把韩文贵队长的职务撤销后，当天就套出七付犁杖翻地。
    在这个基础上，县委对深翻工作又提出了五项具体要求和措施，并具体帮助各个乡镇作了安排。从10月6日到15日、从16日到25日划分为两个阶段，定出了每天的进度，并且确定在每个阶段的最后一天由县委和检查团验收，以保证到10月底基本完成全县深翻任务。同时提出劳动组织要军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化。
    经过这一系列的工作，深耕进度迟缓的局面扭转了。全县在10月4日以前共深翻土地六千零五十八公顷，而10月5日一天就翻了四千二百六十五公顷。只要继续努力，全县土地深翻是可以实现的。（附图片）
