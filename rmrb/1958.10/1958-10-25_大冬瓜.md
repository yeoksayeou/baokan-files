    The Giant Winter Melon (Clapper Talk)
    Li Runjie

    A few days ago, I went to a People's Commune to visit, and the commune's miracles were endless. I wandered around in the vegetable field, and didn't know what was blocking the road. I looked left and right, this thing was really rare. I looked closely, and this thing even had hair on it! Oh my! Good heavens! It turned out to be a giant winter melon! This winter melon was really something, weighing a full eight thousand catties. It was really big, really round, really fat, and really simple. Cut it in half and scoop out the pulp, and it could be used as two large sea boats. Measuring its height, it was two zhang and six chi tall. Dig a door and window and it could be used as a room. It's hygienic and comfortable, naturally white on all four walls. Living inside is very convenient, the space is large and wide. It's windproof and rainproof, and keeps you cool in summer and warm in winter. If you're hungry, eat a winter melon seed, and one person would have to nibble on it for at least three days. (Spoken) That comrade said if a family has several people, that's enough to eat! (Sung) It's hard to deal with such a winter melon for a small family. There's no way to transport it or move it. It's troublesome to get it home. It won't fit in the house. If you put it in the house, the whole family will have to move out. (Added Spoken) The place is all taken up by the winter melon! (Sung) The giant winter melon is for everyone to eat. If there are few people, it doesn't matter. The commune has tens of thousands of people. Eating this winter melon is no problem!

    大冬瓜（快板）
    李润杰前几天我到人民公社去参观，公社的奇迹看不完。在蔬菜地里转了转，不知道是什么东西把路拦，我左边瞧右边看，这个玩艺真少见，到近前仔细瞧，这玩艺上边还长毛，哎哟喝！我的妈，原来是一个大冬瓜！这个冬瓜拔了尊，论分量足有八千斤，真叫大真叫圆，真叫胖真叫憨，切成两半把瓤子掏出去，能当两条大海船；衡量高矮两丈六，挖个门窗就能当房间；又卫生又舒坦，四白落地是天然；住在里边很方便，地方又大还又宽，风不透雨不漏，又避暑还又挡寒，饿了吃个冬瓜籽，一个人至少也得啃三天。（白）那位同志说一家有几口人够
      吃的啦！（唱）小家庭有这么冬瓜不好办，没法运没法搬，弄到家里也麻烦，放在屋里放不下，搁屋里全家都得往外搬。（加白）地方都叫冬瓜给占啦！（唱）大冬瓜大家吃，人口少了不沾弦，公社的人口有几万，吃这个冬瓜不费难！（附图片）
    一个冬瓜赛泰山，站立起来顶住天，
    劳动妇女上边站，要与织女把话言。
