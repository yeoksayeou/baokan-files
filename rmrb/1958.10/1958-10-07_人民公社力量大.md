People's communes are powerful, osmanthus blossoms bloom in August,
The commune has many benefits,
Since ancient times, many people have great strength,
A new ship is launched, and everyone lifts it together.

The moon is bright on the fifteenth and sixteenth,
The commune has many people and great strength,
Rational use of labor,
Unified allocation is a good idea.

Many people are powerful,
We are not afraid of drought or flooding,
Agriculture will achieve mechanization,
Harvest two years' worth of grain in one year.

    人民公社力量大八月桂花朵朵开，公社好处一大堆，自古人多力量大，新船下水众人抬。十五十六月亮光，公社人多力量强，合理使用劳动力，统一调配好主张。人多势众力量强，天旱水浸也唔慌，农业实现机械化，一年打出二年粮。
