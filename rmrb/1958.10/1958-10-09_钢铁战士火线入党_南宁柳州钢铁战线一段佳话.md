Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 8th: Recently, thirty-one steel workers from Nanning and Liuzhou cities in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party.

Among these new Party members who joined on the steel front lines are apprentices, veteran technicians, workshop directors, and engineers. Under the long-term education of the Party, they have consistently worked actively; after the rectification movement, their political consciousness has significantly improved. During this mass steelmaking campaign, they worked hard and practically, unafraid of any difficulties, and made remarkable achievements. For example, Liu Hu, a worker at the steelmaking workshop of the Nanning Transportation Bureau's automobile repair plant, was originally a car driver. When the Party branch issued the call to rush-produce a set of 0.5-ton converter equipment, he immediately led four workers into battle. Six-millimeter-thick steel plates had to be hammered one by one with a twenty-four-pound sledgehammer, and four people could not hammer even two plates in a day. Some workers wavered after two days. Liu Hu, on one hand, encouraged everyone to persevere, and on the other hand, took the lead in sleeping in the workshop; if there was no bed, he slept in the car, and if there was no mosquito net, he slept in his clothes. When welding the joints of the cupola furnace shell, there was no welder, so he welded it himself. Because he had no protective gear, he became red and swollen all over and his skin peeled off after two days of welding. The leaders and doctors repeatedly advised him to rest, but he still insisted on working hard. After seven days and nights of hard work, he finally assembled a cupola furnace and converter ahead of schedule.颜富宏, a worker at this factory, during the process of rushing to produce the Ye-style blower, did not have a foundry workshop or mechanical equipment, so he proactively cooperated with other factories, staying by the lathes of fraternal factories every night. As soon as others stopped, he started working. He worked hard like this for twenty consecutive nights, sleeping at most two or three hours a day, and finally manufactured the blower ahead of schedule, ensuring the needs of steelmaking. Xia Changchun, an old furnace worker at the Liuzhou Machine Repair Factory, never left the front line from the beginning of furnace installation until the molten steel flowed out. The leaders repeatedly asked him to go home to rest, but he refused. He said, "I can't feel at ease if I don't see the molten steel." (Attached picture)

    钢铁战士火线入党
    南宁柳州钢铁战线一段佳话
    新华社南宁8日电　广西僮族自治区南宁、柳州两市最近有三十一名钢铁工人光荣参加了中国共产党。
    这批在钢铁火线上入党的新党员中，有学徒、老技工、车间主任和工程师等。他们在党的长期教育下，一贯积极工作；经过整风运动以后，政治觉悟更有显著提高。在这次全民炼钢铁运动中，他们苦干、实干，不怕一切困难，做出了显著成绩。例如南宁交通局汽车修理厂炼钢车间工人刘虎，原是一个汽车司机。当党总支发出赶制一套零点五吨转炉设备的号召以后，他马上带领四个工人投入战斗。六公厘厚的钢板要用二十四磅的重铁锤一下一下锤打，四个人一天锤打不了两块。有的工人干了两天就动摇了。刘虎一面鼓励大家坚持奋战，一面带头睡在车间，没有床就睡在汽车上，没有蚊帐就穿着衣服睡。在焊接冲天炉壳的接口时，没有焊工，他就自己焊。因为没有防护器，焊了两天就全身红肿脱皮，领导上和医生再三劝他休息，他仍坚持苦战。经过七昼夜苦战，终于提前装成一座冲天炉和转炉。这个厂的工人颜富宏，在赶制叶氏鼓风机的过程中，没有翻砂车间和机械设备，他就主动同别的厂协作，每天夜里都守在兄弟厂的车床边，别人一停，他就开工。他这样一连苦战了二十夜，每天最多睡两三个小时，终于提前制成了鼓风机，保证了炼钢的需要。柳州机器修配厂老炉工夏长春，从开始装炉一直到流出钢水，从未下过火线。领导上再三要他回家休息，他都不肯。他说：“我看不见钢水心就安不下。”（附图片）
