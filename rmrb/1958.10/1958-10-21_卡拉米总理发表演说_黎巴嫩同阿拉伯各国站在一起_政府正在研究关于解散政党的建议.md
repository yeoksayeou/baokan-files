Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 20th: According to a report in the "Al Anwar" newspaper here, Lebanese Prime Minister Karami, in a speech delivered yesterday to the crowds gathered in front of the Prime Minister's office, said, "Lebanon will be a friend to its friends and an enemy to its enemies."

Karami said that Lebanon stands with Arab countries, and this is based on the Lebanese National Charter.

Regarding domestic issues, he said, "Lebanon is now flying with its two wings—Christians and Muslims—and the country is now built on the foundation of friendship, peace, and equality." He emphasized that the recent crisis in Lebanon was artificial and not created by the Lebanese people.

In addressing the reorganization of civil administration, Karami said, "We have a responsibility to cleanse Lebanon of all bad elements to strengthen the unity of our people."

"Al Anwar" also reported that a committee of the Lebanese government responsible for economic agreements will meet today to discuss revising Lebanon's economic agreements with foreign countries. The committee will also discuss the possibility of signing an economic treaty with the United Arab Republic.

At the same time, the Lebanese government has decided to revoke the Shamun government's order prohibiting Syrian newspapers from entering Lebanon.

It is reported that Kazem al-Khalil, a pro-Shamun member of parliament, has indicated that he will not run for Speaker of Parliament. The only remaining candidates are the current Speaker, Oseiran, and Sabri Hamadeh of the National Front.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 20th: According to the Middle East News Agency, Lebanese authorities are studying a proposal advocating the dissolution of all political parties in Lebanon (including the fascist National Social Party and the Liberal National Party led by Shamun).

The news agency also said that the Lebanese government will only allow parties that adopt democratic principles to exist and will prohibit armed and criminal groups and parties from engaging in activities. The news agency quoted Lebanese authorities as saying that a decision on this matter is expected in the coming days.

In commenting on the demands of Lebanese newspapers for the dissolution of political parties, "Al Anwar" pointed out that the Shamun regime had in fact dissolved all nationalist parties, such as the National Assembly Party, the National Bloc, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Supporters' Party, the Constitutional Party, and the Communist Party. The only parties approved by the ousted Shamun regime were the National Social Party, the Phalangist Party, and the Liberal National Party led by Shamun, all of which are reactionary parties serving imperialism.

"Al Anwar" pointed out that it is clear that the current proposal to dissolve political parties is to abolish these reactionary parties in order to pave the way for nationalist parties to resume their activities in safeguarding the interests of Lebanon.

    卡拉米总理发表演说
    黎巴嫩同阿拉伯各国站在一起
    政府正在研究关于解散政党的建议
    新华社大马士革20日电　据此间“光明报”报道，黎巴嫩总理卡拉米昨日向聚集在总理办公处前面的群众发表演说时说，“黎巴嫩对它的朋友将是朋友，对它的敌人将是敌人”。
    卡拉米说，黎巴嫩是同阿拉伯各国站在一起的，这一条是以黎巴嫩国民宪章为基础的。
    在谈到国内问题时，他说，“黎巴嫩现在用了它的两个翅膀——基督教徒和穆斯林——在飞翔，现在全国是建立在友爱和平等的基础上”。他强调指出，黎巴嫩最近的危机是人为的，它不是黎巴嫩人民制造的。
    在谈到整顿民政机构问题时，卡拉米说，“我们有责任清洗黎巴嫩的一切坏分子以加强我国人民的团结。”
      “光明报”又报道，黎巴嫩政府负责经济协定的一个委员会今天将举行会议，讨论修改黎巴嫩同外国已经签订的经济协定问题。委员会还将讨论同阿拉伯联合共和国签订经济协定的可能性。
    同时，黎巴嫩政府已经决定撤销夏蒙政府颁布的禁止叙利亚地区报纸进入黎巴嫩的命令。
    据报道，亲夏蒙的议员卡齐姆·哈利勒已经表示不竞选议会议长。现在仅有的候选人是现任议长奥塞兰和民族阵线的萨布里·哈马德。
    新华社大马士革20日电　据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩当局正在研究主张把黎巴嫩一切政党（包括法西斯的国家社会党和以夏蒙为首的自由国民党）解散的建议。
    这家通讯社又说，黎巴嫩政府将只容许采取民主原则的政党存在，并且将禁止武装的和罪恶的集团和党派进行活动。这家通讯社援引黎巴嫩权威人士的话说，预料将在今后几天内作出有关这方面的决定。
    此间“光明报”在评述黎巴嫩报纸主张解散政党的要求时说，夏蒙政权事实上已经解散了所有的民族主义政党，诸如国民议会党、民族集团、社会进步党、支持者党、立宪党和共产党。已经下台的夏蒙政权所核准存在的仅有国家社会党、长枪党和以夏蒙为首的自由国民党，而所有这些政党都是为帝国主义服务的反动政党。
    “光明报”指出，很明显，现在关于解散政党的主张就是要取消这些反动政党，以便为民族主义政党恢复它们维护黎巴嫩的利益的活动铺平道路。
