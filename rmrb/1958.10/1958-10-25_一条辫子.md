    A Single Braid

    The train pulled into the station. Before it had even stopped completely, I was the first to jump off. Before I could get my bearings, a Young Pioneer ran up to me and greeted me in clear Chinese, "Uncle, you've worked hard!" Then, she looked up with her round, rosy little face, took the red scarf from her neck, and I squatted down to let her tie the red scarf around my neck, then picked her up. At that moment, I saw two shimmering tears in the little girl's eyes, and her two black, clear pupils were full of reluctance and attachment. Suddenly, I noticed that she only had one braid tied on the right side, hanging long down her back; the one on the left was only a short stub—like a whisk handle. I wondered why she had cut off one of her long braids. I didn't have time to think about it then, wanting to say a few words to comfort the little girl who was seeing me off. But a rush of emotion surged into my heart. Tears flowed uncontrollably down my cheeks, and immediately, the crowd and the sea of flowers disappeared from view…

    I don't know how long it was before I was awakened by the song "Weng Hai Ya". I gently put her down and danced the "Weng Hai Ya" with her. For a long time, I noticed that her eyes were still so moist. Her long braid swayed back and forth behind her, and the question from before came back to my mind: "Why does this little girl only have one braid?"

    The entire station was filled with the passion of farewell, and the singing and dancing continued. In our dance circle, I learned everything about her from a middle-aged woman who spoke very good Chinese—the little girl's teacher:

    It was in the spring of 1951 that American bombs took her parents' lives. She was only just over two years old then. A volunteer soldier rescued her from the fire. This volunteer soldier, in order to protect her in the wilderness, was shot through the heart by the machine gun fire of an American plane. She was saved from death. Later, she grew up under the care of the volunteer army and the local government. In school, her academic performance was the best in the class. The little girl often said: "Half of my life belongs to the motherland, and half belongs to the Volunteer Army Uncle. One of my two braids also belongs to the Volunteer Army Uncle." This time, as the Volunteer Army withdrew from Korea for peace, when she bid farewell to the first group of Volunteer Army returning home, right here, she cut off the braid on the left with scissors and gave it to a Volunteer Army Uncle. She said, "Uncle, take it with you and remember me often."

    The train was about to leave. The little girl clung tightly to my leg, as if that would make me stay. I pleaded repeatedly, but she still wouldn't let go. Finally, her teacher said something to her, and she released me so I could board the train.

    As the train started, she followed the crowd of people seeing us off, like waves chasing waves, seeing us off for one stretch after another. When the train had left them far behind, I could still faintly see her little hand waving in the air.

    一条辫子
    王世明
    火车开进了站，还未站稳，我就第一个跳下车来。我还没有来得及辨明方向，一个少先队员几步跑到我的面前，用清楚的中国话向我问候：“叔叔，您辛苦了！”紧接着，她仰起她那圆圆的红润的小脸，从颈上取下了红领巾，我蹲下来让她把红领巾系在我的脖子上后，顺手把她抱了起来。就在这时，我看见这个小姑娘眼里含着两汪晶莹的泪水，两颗黑里透明的眼珠充满了难分难舍的留恋。忽然，我发现她只在右边扎了一条发辫，长长地搭在背脊上；左边的一条只剩下很短的一截——像个炊帚把了。我很奇怪，为什么要把长长的发辫剪去一条呢？当时我顾不得去想这些，想说几句话来安慰这个送别的小姑娘。但一股热流突然涌上心头。眼泪情不自禁地顺着脸颊簌簌流下来，立刻，眼前的人群、花海都看不见了，……
    不知过了好久，我被“嗡嘿呀”的歌声惊醒过来。我轻轻地把她放下，和她一起跳起了“嗡嗨呀”舞。好久，我发现她的两眼还是那么湿润。她的那一条长长的小辫在身后来回飘摆，刚才的疑问又涌上了心头：“为什么这个小姑娘只留一条小辫呢？”
    整个车站上充满了离别的激情，歌舞一直持续着。在我们这个舞圈里，我从一个中国话说得很好的中年妇女——小女孩的老师口里了解到她的一切：
    那是1951年春季，美国炸弹夺去了她父母的生命。那时她还是个刚满两周岁的孩子，一个志愿军战士从火里救出了她。这个志愿军战士在野地里为了保护她，又被美国飞机的机枪子弹打穿了心窝。她从死里得生。后来，她在志愿军和当地政府的关怀下成长起来。在学校里，她的学习成绩是班上最好的一个。小姑娘常说：“我的生命，一半是祖国的，一半是志愿军叔叔的。我这两条小辫，也有一条是志愿军叔叔的。”这次志愿军为了和平撤出朝鲜，她欢送第一批志愿军归国部队时，就在此地，她自己用剪子剪下左边的一条小辫，送给了一位志愿军叔叔。她说：“叔叔，带着它，经常记着我。”
    火车快开了，小姑娘紧紧地抱住我的腿，好像这样就可以叫我留下来；我再三请求，她还是不松手，后来，还是她的老师向她说了些什么，才放我上了车。
    列车开动后，她随着欢送的人群，像波浪赶波浪一样，送了一程又一程。当火车远远地把他们抛在后边时，我还隐隐约约地看得见她的小手在空中摆动。
