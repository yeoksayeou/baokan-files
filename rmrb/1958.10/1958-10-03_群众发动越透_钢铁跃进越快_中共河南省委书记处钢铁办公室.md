The mass movement of the whole party and all the people of Henan Province to vigorously produce steel has now formed a climax and is beginning to leap forward to a new stage. The people of the whole province are advancing victoriously with heroic spirit and tenacious spirit, expanding their achievements.

The Victory of the Vanguard Battle

In terms of steel production, Henan Province's foundation was very poor in the past. Last year, it only produced about 3,000 tons of native iron, and not a single ton of steel. In April this year, under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, it was decided to produce 500,000 tons of iron and 200,000 tons of steel this year. At that time, some people doubted whether this plan was too large, but the Provincial Party Committee's determination was firm, believing that this plan could be fully realized. Encouraged by the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the steel leap forward plan was set to produce 1.5 million tons of iron and 300,000 tons of steel this year. This is a glorious and arduous task for the whole party and the people of Henan. In late August, the average daily output of pig iron was only 350 tons. In early September, the average daily output of iron only reached 568.9 tons and steel 63.7 tons. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole province worked hard day and night, and the daily output began to break through 1,000 tons after September 10. On September 15, they broke through various difficulties, reversed the slow progress of the battle, and smelted 18,944 tons of pig iron in one day, winning a victory in the vanguard battle of iron smelting. A total of 86 counties and cities participated in iron smelting, including 9 counties with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons (including Tangyin County, which produced 1,000 tons of iron on the 14th), and 11 counties and cities with a daily output of more than 100 tons. A steel army of 3.6 million people was mobilized, with 420,000 various transport vehicles. A total of 45,875 furnaces of various types participated in production, of which 44,804 were native furnaces, accounting for 97.6%. From September 15th to 25th, a total of 83,665 tons of pig iron were produced, with an average daily output of 7,606 tons, a sharp increase of 12.3 times compared with early September; a total of 1,501.3 tons of steel were produced, with an average daily output of 136.4 tons, an increase of 1.14 times compared with early September. A large-scale mass movement of the whole party and all the people to vigorously produce steel has truly formed, pushing the production of steel to a new stage. The people of the whole province responded to Chairman Mao's great call for "a great leap forward in steel on September 15" with practical actions. As of September 27, the mobilized steel army had 5.2 million people, and 148,040 various iron smelting furnaces had been built. On September 28, 29, and 30, three more steel large-area high-yield satellites were launched in succession. In these three days, the province produced a total of 186,358.75 tons of pig iron and 9,156.21 tons of steel.

Liberating Thought, Clarifying Direction, and Adopting Correct Guidelines and Policies are the Primary Key to Ensuring a Great Leap Forward in Steel

The process of the whole party and all the people vigorously producing steel is a process of sharp struggle between two guidelines and two roads. When deciding on this year's production tasks, the first fundamental question encountered by the whole party in Henan was what guidelines and roads to adopt: Should we adopt the guidelines and roads of relying on the broad masses, mobilizing the whole party and all the people, focusing on small-scale and indigenous methods to ensure more, faster, better, and more economical steel production? Or should we rely on a few people, focusing on foreign methods and large-scale methods, to produce steel in a less, slower, worse, and more expensive way? Should we demand the highest possible speed? Or should we do as much as possible, rather than be shoddy, rather than be slow and chaotic? At that time, based on the Party's general line and the actual conditions in Henan, the Provincial Party Committee determined that our current guidelines could only be: focusing on small-scale, focusing on indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining points and areas, combining large, medium, and small-scale, establishing thousands upon thousands of native blast furnaces and small blast furnaces, relying on the masses, relying on our own efforts, and vigorously producing steel with the whole party and all the people. Because only in this way can we truly mobilize the people of the whole province, form a mass movement, and achieve the mobilization of the whole party and all the people, blooming everywhere, and ten thousand horses galloping. However, in implementing these guidelines and policies, we went through a struggle between two viewpoints and two attitudes. The first ideological obstacle we encountered was the mysterious view and negative attitude towards steel production. They were superstitious about foreign furnaces, despised native furnaces, and simply pursued modern large-scale iron and steel enterprises, not believing that farmers could smelt steel on a large scale. They said, "Relying solely on native furnaces and native methods cannot guarantee high steel yield"; "Steel is very complicated, not simple, not as good as light industry." If we do not overcome these erroneous viewpoints on guidelines and policies, steel production cannot advance. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee made it clear that these guidelines and policies are the most practical and fully in line with the principle of continuous revolution and the spirit of the general line. Because according to the current conditions, we can only focus on native furnaces, while not relaxing foreign furnaces. After obtaining a large amount of steel, we can transform the small, scattered, and low-level iron smelting furnaces and gradually develop them into modern and relatively concentrated iron and steel bases. Facts have proved that this is an honest and completely correct guideline. This is the specific application of the Party's policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and the mass line in steel production. It is precisely through these guidelines and policies that we have mobilized the enthusiasm and initiative of millions of people, overcome various difficulties, and achieved victory in the vanguard battle.

Putting Politics in Command, Mobilizing the Whole Party, Improving the Communist Style, and Implementing the Mass Line

The facts of the past two months have proven that implementing the Party's instructions, strengthening political and ideological work, thoroughly criticizing various right-leaning conservative ideas, raising the awareness of the whole Party, and mobilizing the whole people are the great driving forces for launching the movement of the whole Party and all the people to vigorously produce steel. We carried out a major mobilization among the whole Party and all the people, launched a major debate, and resolutely criticized "skepticism," "mysticism," "conditionalism," and "reach-out faction" and "promote-retreat faction." They cannot see the tremendous power of the people, and cannot break through the objective difficulties that often exist before the birth of new things; they do not have the communist style of daring to think and act and strive for the upstream, but are superstitious, conservative, and willing to stay downstream; they do not rely on the masses and rely on their own efforts, but reach out upwards and rely solely on external aid. They believe that without equipment and technology, relying solely on small native furnaces cannot produce high steel yields, and that with a poor foundation and bad conditions, we can only do a small job this year, not a big one. After a period of production practice, some cadres developed wavering and shrinking emotions, believing that we can only take it slowly and cannot make a great leap forward. Some people were afraid of affecting agricultural production and did not promptly shift the focus of leadership to steel, that is, grasping steel with the right hand and agriculture with the left hand; some local leading cadres also said: If this continues, this year's agricultural harvest will be lost. This right-leaning conservative thinking only calculates small accounts, not big accounts, and does not understand that this is the key to whether the entire industrialization and agricultural mechanization can make a great leap forward. After the full-scale deployment of steel production, localism and decentralism, lack of planning and discipline have become the main stumbling blocks on the road to steel production development. In response to a series of erroneous viewpoints, the whole Party and all the people launched a wide and in-depth ideological debate. In this struggle, Chairman Mao's several instructions on steel production became a powerful weapon for us to fully mobilize the masses and overcome erroneous ideas. Our basic methods are the whole Party and all the people, combining top and bottom, carrying out large-scale mobilization, large-scale airing of views, large-character posters, and large-scale debates. The themes are: "Why vigorously produce steel? Can we vigorously produce steel? How to vigorously produce steel? What are the favorable and difficult conditions? What methods should we use to overcome difficulties?" "What attitude should everyone take in vigorously producing steel? How should we contribute our strength?" and so on.

From provincial government agencies to people's communes, large-scale steel mobilization and debates have been carried out. This debate was combined with the opposition to US imperialist aggression, enabling the people of the whole province to deeply understand the decisive role of steel in national industrialization, national defense modernization, and agricultural mechanization, and to recognize that steel production not only has significant economic significance, but also is the fundamental key to determining whether our country can leap forward, build socialism early, and rapidly transition to communism. This has laid a solid ideological foundation for the great leap forward in steel, ensuring that the 4 million steel army is high-spirited and full of energy. In Baofeng County, two townships mobilized 35,000 people to pan for iron sand day and night in the rain. Old men and old ladies over the age of fifty also went to the river beach to pan for iron sand, panning 1,064 tons of iron sand in two days. The masses in Gaocheng Township, Dengfeng County, formed 52 juvenile satellite companies; there are many such moving examples. We must also carry out the struggle of pulling out white flags and inserting red flags on the steel front. For example, the Party Branch Secretary and Director of the Jiaozuo Iron and Steel Plant were seriously right-leaning, irresponsible, and even ignored the sabotage of bad people. After being suspended from their posts for self-reflection, the daily output of the 54-cubic-meter blast furnace immediately rose from about 20 tons to about 60 tons. This shows that the more Marxism there is, the more steel can be produced. Facts have proven that the stronger the political work, the deeper the masses' minds are dug, the more thorough the ideological debate, the more fully the masses are mobilized, the faster the steel leap forward, and the deeds of large-scale cooperation between cadres and the masses within hundreds of miles, tens of millions of people working hard day and night, everyone contributing ideas, and everyone contributing materials will continue to emerge. It is true that "small native furnaces are omnipotent furnaces, smelting both steel and people."

Continuous Assaults, Launching Satellites, Setting off a Climax, and Promoting a Leap Forward

We believe that continuous assaults and launching several steel satellites are effective methods for mobilizing the broad masses and organizing a climax in steel production. There are many benefits to doing so: it can break open the situation, boost morale, break superstitions, liberate thoughts, and correct various erroneous viewpoints; it can comprehensively review our strength and take "steel as the key link" to drive all aspects of work to catch up quickly; it tests the leadership, trains the masses, exposes contradictions, and creates a situation from a new imbalance to a new balance, which is convenient for organizing forces at a new level of production and promoting all aspects of work to move towards a new climax. In particular, it can promote a great leap forward in steel and push steel production to a new stage. Because running steel is an extremely broad and large-scale mass movement, after such a few assaults and a few satellites, the masses can be more fully mobilized. This is a concrete manifestation of the communist style of daring to think and act, and it is the result of development from gradual progress to a leap forward, which is fully in line with the spirit of continuous revolution. First of all, launching satellites will leap steel production to a higher level. For example, after Lushan, Yuxian, Xinyang, Shangcheng, and other counties and the province as a whole launched satellites on September 15, their output has increased several times. The daily iron output of these counties has jumped from tens of tons, one or two hundred tons to thousands of tons, or even thousands of tons. The first satellite launched by Lushan County on August 28 was the driving force for the province's great leap forward on September 15, which prompted the province's output to increase sharply by 13.3 times. Secondly, it greatly encouraged the broad masses to strive for high steel production and large-area high yield, and to complete the production plan ahead of schedule, promoting the development of the steel red flag competition movement, while the "head-shaking faction in front of the furnace" was speechless. Thirdly, breaking through key points and driving the overall situation: it shows people how high its production level is. This new production level breaks through the old balance and creates a new imbalance, which puts pressure on all aspects of work to speed up and keep up. This drives all kinds of work: coal production increased by 40% after the 15th compared with August, and 24.5% compared with early September, with 800 new small coal kilns opened within a month; the machinery industry is working hard day and night to rush to produce equipment; the loading and unloading time of railways has been greatly shortened, and the operation has been accelerated; in just 20 days, a total of 3,265 kilometers of new and repaired roads, tens of thousands of miles of carriageways and cart tracks, more than 3,000 bridges and culverts, more than 4,700 kilometers of newly erected telephone lines, more than 1,200 installations, and 122 new postal and telecommunications offices were built, and the speed of furnace construction was unprecedentedly improved; the output of refractory bricks increased by 65% compared with early September, and so on. We know that closely and specifically organizing all aspects of work around steel production at any time is an important measure to ensure the key of steel. However, only when satellites are launched on a large scale and steel production leaps to a new level can we more effectively and reliably grasp the eight links of mining, coal mining, transportation, smelting, machinery, power, auxiliary materials, and living supplies, and closely connect them one after another.

Party Committee Leadership, Secretary in Command, Organizing Coordination, Ensuring Key Points

The key to truly leaping forward in steel production lies in strengthening leadership, concentrating forces, and ensuring key points. That is to say, we must be able to make steel production the focus of leadership of Party committees at all levels as soon as possible, with the Party committee unified leadership, the first secretary in command, most Party committee members participating, division of labor and responsibility, going to the front line in person, strengthening command, and conducting large-scale experimental furnaces to break through the production and technical barriers. At the same time, under the leadership of the Party, we must organize communist cooperation, concentrate all forces, and ensure the key points of steel. We believe that the determination of the Party committee is first and foremost the strong determination and soaring enthusiasm of the secretary for vigorously producing steel, which is of decisive significance. Where the determination is great, the enthusiasm is sufficient, and the courage to think and act, it develops quickly and gains the initiative; conversely, where the Party committee and secretary begin to waver and hesitate, with divided attention, it cannot keep up and becomes passive. This is a profound lesson. Now, from the Provincial Party Committee to the Party committees of prefectures, cities, counties, and communes with steel tasks, the first secretary is in command, grasping steel production practically. Moreover, many Party committee members personally go to the front line, go deep into the mining site and furnace site, and integrate with the masses, implementing "three-ization" and "four-together" (organization militarization, production combatization, life collectivization; eating together, living together, working together, and researching together). This demonstrates a high degree of revolutionary quality. This exemplary action of setting an example is a great encouragement to the masses, which is the key to achieving major victories. In order to obtain key experiences, many Party committee secretaries and cadres personally run steel "experimental fields." In Nanyang Prefecture alone, there are 480 "secretary furnaces" and thousands of "cadre furnaces." According to incomplete statistics, there are about 10,000 "secretary furnaces," "command furnaces," "cadre furnaces," and "experimental furnaces" in the province. The red flag competition movement has also been widely launched.

In order to strengthen production management, we have decided to divide the battle zone or steel base according to production conditions and furnace group deployment, form a regional command, strengthen the management organization, rationally organize labor, and unify command and dispatch. We have put forward "factory management, specialized production, planned work, and standardized furnaces," and have also compiled professional teams for mining, coal mining, smelting, furnace construction, repair and matching, etc., or called them divisions, regiments, battalions, and companies; and have universally carried out "six-fixing" and "seven-fixing." Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the comprehensive communist cooperation, mutual support, close cooperation, and joint combat have played a significant role. This is one of the important organizational methods of relying on the masses to vigorously produce steel. Now, extensive and comprehensive communist cooperation has been launched between cities and rural areas, mountainous areas and plains, departments and departments, and between workers and peasants. This has fully utilized the resources, funds, equipment, technology, and labor, and concentrated them to the places where they are most needed, ensuring that they serve steel production more effectively. The people's commune in the whole province has opened up roads for the whole people to vigorously produce steel, especially playing a major role in ideology, organization, labor, and material support, ensuring the smooth realization of communist cooperation.

Although our steel production has taken a step forward, it is only the beginning of breaking through the production barrier, and it is still far from completing the entire task. At the same time, the technical barrier has not been universally broken through, so production is not normal, some quality is not high, and some places are still very backward. Steel production has only recently been grasped. Therefore, the central link of the current work is to further increase output, improve quality, ensure normal production, and strive to stabilize pig iron production at 20,000 to 30,000 tons and steel production at 5,000 tons in early October. To this end, we must strengthen political and ideological leadership, strengthen organizational, planning, and technical management, combine points and areas, combine indigenous and foreign methods, continue to focus on the main links of mining, digging, smelting, transportation, technology, and supply, closely connect them, build furnaces while producing, select furnace types with high output, good quality, normal production, and fuel saving, universally promote them, and convene on-site meetings in a timely manner. We believe that under the leadership and care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, by relying closely on the people, exerting full effort, advancing victoriously, we will surely obtain greater victories and achieve greater leaps forward.

    群众发动越透　钢铁跃进越快
    中共河南省委书记处钢铁办公室
    目前河南省全党全民大办钢铁的群众运动，已经形成高潮，开始跃进到一个新的阶段。全省人民正在以英雄的气概、顽强的精神，乘胜前进，扩大战果。
    前哨战的胜利
    在钢铁生产上，我省过去的基础很差，去年只生产土铁三千来吨，钢一吨也没有。今年4月间，在工农业大跃进的形势下，确定今年生产铁五十万吨，钢二十万吨。当时就有人怀疑这个计划是否太大，但是省委的决心是坚定的，认为这个计划完全可以实现。在党的八大二次会议决议的鼓舞下，钢铁跃进计划确定今年生产铁一百五十万吨，钢三十万吨。这是河南全党和全省人民的光荣而艰巨的任务。8月下旬，平均日产生铁仅三百五十吨，9月上旬平均日产铁也只达到五百六十八点九吨，钢六十三点七吨。但是全省人民在党的领导下，英勇风发，日夜苦战，9月10日以后日产量开始突破千吨；9月15日冲开了各种难关，扭转了进度迟缓的战局，一天炼出生铁一万八千九百四十四吨，在炼铁前哨战中，打了一个胜仗。参加炼铁的县、市共八十六个，其中：日产一千吨以上的县九个（包括14日产千吨铁的汤阴县在内），日产一百吨以上的县、市十一个。出动的钢铁大军三百六十万人，各种运输车辆四十二万辆。参加生产的各种炉子四万五千八百七十五座，其中：土炉四万四千八百零四座，占97.6％。15日至25日，共产生铁八万三千六百六十五吨，平均日产七千六百零六吨，比9月上旬猛增十二点三倍；钢共产一千五百零一点三吨，平均日产一百三十六点四吨，比上旬增长一点一四倍。真正形成了大规模的全党全民千军万马大办钢铁的群众运动，把钢铁的生产跃进到一个新的阶段。全省人民以实际行动回答了毛主席“要在9月15日来一个钢铁大跃进”的伟大号召。至9月27日止，已出动的钢铁大军有五百二十万人；已建成的各种炼铁炉子十四万八千零四十座。9月28日、29日和30日，又连续发出三颗钢铁大面积丰产卫星。这三天全省共产生铁十八万六千三百五十八点七五吨，产钢九千一百五十六点二一吨。
    解放思想，明确方向，采取正确的方针路线是保证钢铁大跃进的首要关键
    全党全民大办钢铁的过程，是两种方针、两条道路尖锐斗争的过程。在决定今年生产任务的时候，河南全党首先遇到的一个根本问题，就是采取什么方针和道路的问题，是采取依靠广大群众、全党全民动手，以小型、土法为主，保证多快好省地大办钢铁的方针道路呢？或者是依靠少数人，依靠洋法、大型为主，少慢差费地小办钢铁的方针道路呢？是要求尽可能的高速度呢？或者是宁少勿滥、宁慢勿乱的搞多少算多少呢？当时省委根据党的总路线和河南的现实条件，确定我们当前的方针只能是：以小型为主，以土法为主，土洋结合，点面结合，大中小相结合，建立千千万万土高炉、小高炉，依靠群众，自力更生，全党全民大办钢铁。因为只有这样，才能真正调动全省人民，形成群众运动，才能作到全党全民动手，遍地开花，万马奔腾。但是，在贯彻这条方针路线的时候，经过了两种观点、两种态度的斗争。首先遇到的思想障碍，就是：对钢铁生产的神秘观点、消极态度，他们迷信洋炉，轻视土炉，单纯追求近代化的大型钢铁企业，不相信农民可以大炼钢铁。说什么“光靠土炉、土法，不能保证钢铁丰产”；“钢铁很复杂，不简单，比不得轻工业”。如果不克服这种方针路线上的错误观点，钢铁生产就不能前进。为此，省委明确指出这条方针路线是最切合实际的，是完全符合不断革命的原则和总路线的精神的。因为根据当前条件，我们只能以土炉为主，同时不放松洋炉，等取得大量钢铁后，就可以将小型的、分散的、低级的炼铁炉，加以改造，逐步发展为近代化的、较为集中的钢铁基地。事实证明：这是一条老老实实的、完全正确的方针路线。这是党的大中小相结合、土洋并举的方针和群众路线在钢铁生产上的具体运用。我们正是通过这条方针路线，调动了千百万人民的积极性和主动性，战胜了各种困难，取得了前哨战的胜利。
    政治挂帅，全党动员，提高共产主义风格，贯彻执行群众路线
    两个月来的事实证明：贯彻执行党的指示，加强政治思想工作，彻底批判各种右倾保守思想，提高全党认识，进行全民动员，是掀起全党全民大办钢铁运动的巨大动力。我们在全党全民中实行大动员，展开大辩论，坚决地批判了“怀疑论”、“神秘论”、“唯条件论”和“伸手派”、“促退派”。他们看不到人民的巨大力量，冲不破新生事物诞生前所常有的客观困难；他们不是敢想敢干力争上游的共产主义风格，而是迷信多端，因循保守，甘居下游；不是依靠群众，自力更生，而是伸手向上，单靠外援。他们认为：没有设备技术，光靠小土炉不能钢铁丰产，基础差，条件坏，今年只能小搞，不能大搞。经历了一段生产实践之后，在某些干部中产生了动摇退缩情绪，认为只能慢慢来，不能大跃进。有人生怕影响农业生产，没有及时把领导重点转到钢铁上来，即右手抓钢铁，左手抓农业；也有的地区领导干部说：这样下去，就把今年农业丰收赔光了。这种右倾保守思想，只会算小账，不会算大账，不懂得这是关乎整个工业化和农业机械化能否大跃进的关键。而在钢铁生产全面展开后，本位主义和分散主义、无计划、无纪律的现象，又成为钢铁生产发展道路上的主要绊脚石。针对一系列的错误观点，全党全民展开了一场广泛的深入的思想大辩论，在这场斗争中，毛主席对钢铁生产的几次指示，成为我们充分发动群众，战胜错误思想的有力武器。我们的基本方法，就是全党全民、上下结合、开展大动员、大鸣放、大字报、大辩论。主题是：“为什么要大办钢铁？能不能大办钢铁？怎么样大办钢铁？有哪些有利条件和困难条件？用什么办法战胜困难？”“在大办钢铁中每个人应抱什么态度？应如何贡献自己的力量？”等等。
    从省直机关到人民公社，都进行过钢铁大动员、大辩论。这场大辩论和反对美帝侵略结合起来，使得全省人民深刻认识钢铁在国家工业化、国防现代化和农业机械化方面的决定作用，认识钢铁生产不仅具有重大的经济意义，而且是决定我们国家能否飞跃前进，早日建成社会主义，并迅速向共产主义过渡的根本关键。这就为钢铁大跃进打下了坚强的思想基础，保证了四百万钢铁大军斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。宝丰县两个乡，出动三万五千人，不分昼夜，冒雨淘铁砂。五十岁以上的老汉、老太太也纷纷到河滩去淘铁砂，两天淘铁砂一千零六十四吨。登封县郜城乡群众编起五十二个少年卫星连；这种可歌可泣的事例很多。在钢铁战线上也必须开展拔白旗插红旗的斗争。如焦作钢铁厂的总支书记和厂长严重右倾，不负责任，甚至对坏人破坏也置之不理，被停职反省之后，五十四立方公尺高炉的日产量就由二十吨左右立即上升到六十吨左右。这说明马克思主义一多，就能够多出钢铁。事实证明：哪里的政治工作越强，群众思想挖的越深，思想辩论得越透，群众发动越充分，哪里的钢铁跃进就越快，数百里内的干部群众大协作，千百万人日夜苦战，人人献计，人人献物资的事迹就会不断涌现，真是“小土炉是万能炉，既炼钢铁又炼人”。
    连续突击，大放卫星，
    掀起高潮，推动跃进
    我们认为连续突击，放几次钢铁大卫星，是发动广大群众，组织钢铁生产高潮的有效方法。这样作的好处很多：它可以轰开局面，鼓舞士气，破除迷信，解放思想，纠正各种错误论点；它可以全面检阅一下我们的力量“以钢为纲”，带动各方面的工作迅速跟上来；它考验了领导，锻炼了群众，暴露了矛盾，出现由新的不平衡到新平衡的局面，便于在新的生产水平上组织力量，促使各方面工作走向新的高潮。特别是可以促使钢铁大跃进，把钢铁生产推向一个新的阶段。因为办钢铁是极为广泛的大规模的群众运动，经过这样突击几次，放几次卫星，就可以把群众更充分的调动起来，这是敢想敢干的共产主义风格的具体表现，是由渐进到跃进的发展结果，完全符合不断革命的精神。首先，放了卫星就把钢铁跃进到更高的生产水平。如鲁山、禹县、信阳、商城等县和全省9月15日放卫星后，产量都翻了几番。这几个县的铁日产量均由几十吨、一、二百吨跃进千吨，甚至几千吨。而鲁山县8月28日第一次放卫星，是促使全省9月15日大跃进的动力，促使全省产量猛增十三点三倍。其二，大大地鼓舞了广大群众争取钢铁高额丰产和大面积丰产，提前超额完成生产计划的信心，推动钢铁红旗竞赛运动的开展，而“炉前摇头派”则哑口无言了。其三，突破重点，带动全面：它向人们表现出它有多么高的生产水平，这个新的生产水平，冲破了历来旧的平衡，出现了新的不平衡，这就压着各方面工作不得不加快步调，紧跟上来。这就把各种工作都带动起来了：煤炭生产，15日以后日产量比8月增长40％，比9月上旬增长24.5％，一个月内新开八百个小煤窑；机械工业正在快马加鞭，日夜赶制设备；铁路装卸时间大大缩短了，运行加快了；短短二十天内共新修整修公路三千二百六十五公里，大车道、驮运道数万里，桥梁涵洞三千余座，新架设电话线四千七百多公里，安机一千二百多个，新建邮电所一百二十二个，建炉速度空前提高；耐火砖产量比9月上旬提高65％，等等。我们知道：围绕钢铁生产，随时把各方面的工作严密地具体地组织起来，这是保证钢铁重点的重要措施。但是，只有在大放卫星，钢铁生产跃到新的水平时，才能把采矿、挖煤、运输、冶炼、机械、动力、辅助材料、生活供应等八个环节，更有效更可靠地抓起来，并使之一环扣一环密切地衔接起来。
    党委领导，书记挂帅，
    组织协作，保证重点
    钢铁生产真正跃上去，关键在于加强领导，集中力量，保证重点。这就是说，必须及早能把钢铁生产作为各级党委的领导重心，党委统一领导，第一书记挂帅，多数党委委员参加，分工负责，亲临前线，加强指挥，大搞试验炉，突破生产关和技术关。同时，要在党的领导下，组织共产主义大协作，集中一切力量，保证钢铁重点。我们认为：党委的决心首先是书记对于大办钢铁的坚强决心和冲天干劲，是具有决定意义的。哪里的决心大、干劲足、敢想敢干，就发展的快，而且取得了主动权；反之，哪里的党委和书记开始动摇犹豫，三心二意，就跟不上去，形成被动。这是一条深刻的经验教训。现在从省委起到有钢铁任务的地、市、县委和公社党委，都已经是第一书记挂帅，把钢铁生产切实地抓起来了，而且许多党委委员亲自上前线，深入到采矿现场，炉子现场，和群众打成一片，实行“三化”、“四同”（组织军事化，生产战斗化，生活集体化；同吃、同住、同劳动、同研究）。表现了高度的革命品质。这种以身作则的模范行动，对群众是一个极大的鼓舞，这是取得重大胜利的关键。为了取得重点经验，许多党委书记和干部亲自办钢铁“试验田”，仅南阳专区就有四百八十个“书记炉”，上千个“干部炉”，据不完全的统计，全省“书记炉”、“指挥炉”、“干部炉”、“实验炉”，大约有一万个。并且普遍地发动了红旗竞赛运动。
    为了加强生产管理，我们确定按生产条件和炉群部署划分战区或钢铁基地，组成区域指挥部，强化管理机构，合理组织劳力，统一指挥调度。提出：“管理工厂化、生产专业化、工作计划化、炉子定型化”，同时编成采矿、挖煤、冶炼、建炉、运输、修配等专业大队，或叫师、团、营、连；并普遍进行“六定”、“七定”。在各级党委的领导下，开展共产主义全面大协作，互相支援、密切配合，共同战斗，已经发挥了显著的作用，这是依靠群众大办钢铁的重要组织方式之一。现在城市和农村、山区和平原、部门和部门以及工农之间，开展了广泛的全面的共产主义大协作，这样就使资源、资金、设备、技术、劳力等方面的力量得到了充分的利用，把它们集中地使用到最需要的地方去。保证更有效地为钢铁生产服务。全省范围的人民公社化，为全民大办钢铁开辟了道路，特别在思想、组织、劳力、物资支援上起到了重大作用，保证了共产主义大协作的顺利实现。
    我们的钢铁生产虽然向前跃进了一步，但仅仅是开始突破生产关，离完成整个任务还差很远。同时，技术关还未普遍突破，因而生产还不正常，有的质量不高，有些地方还很落后。钢的生产最近才抓。因此，当前工作的中心环节，是进一步增加产量，提高质量，保证正常生产，争取10月上旬能把生铁产量稳定在二万至三万吨，钢产量稳定在五千吨的水平上。为此，必须加强政治思想领导，加强组织、计划、技术的管理工作，作到点面结合，土洋结合，继续抓紧采、挖、炼、运、技、供几个主要环节，密切衔接，一边生产、一边建炉，选定产量高、质量好、生产正常、节约燃料的炉型，普遍推广，及时召开现场会议。我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的领导关怀下，紧紧依靠人民群众，鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，就一定能够获得更大战果，得到更大跃进。
