In 1958, I participated in a meeting for worker amateur cultural and artistic activists held by Zhou Yang at the Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace.

At this meeting, Zhou Yang blatantly claimed that "all works should not just write about machines and meetings, people don't come to watch performances to see machines and meetings," and "some current works are just filled with the roar of machines." Isn't this a blatant opposition to our workers' artistic creation?

We workers live in the factory and fight by the machines. If we don't write about the sound of machines and small group meetings, who will? We workers have the deepest feelings for the sound of machines in New China! The sound of machines in New China is the song of the workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, changing the face of our motherland and declaring war on the Earth! It is the footsteps of the three great revolutionary struggles leaping forward! The sound of machines is the heartfelt song of our working class singing praises to the Party and Chairman Mao! The sound of machines is the war drum of our Chinese working class supporting the world revolution! Only the class enemies fear the revolutionary machine sounds of New China; only the revisionist clique of Zhou Yang and his ilk would oppose our revolutionary machine sounds. We will not only write about it, but we will write about it loudly and clearly, and we will continue to write about it forever! Zhou Yang and his clique opposing our writing about the sound of machines is just the buzzing of a few flies, which cannot cover up the roaring sound of our revolutionary machines!

Zhou Yang's opposition to our writing about small group meetings is also malicious. Our small group meetings are classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; they are platforms for us workers to set ambitious goals, fully display collective wisdom; they are more importantly, battlefields of class struggle! Why shouldn't revolutionary small group meetings be written about! Zhou Yang's opposition to our writing about the sound of machines and small group meetings, in essence, is opposition to literature and art serving proletarian politics, and opposition to writing about the fighting lives of our working class!

    隆隆的机器声和嗡嗡的苍蝇叫
    上海电缆厂钳工　殷兴宝
    一九五八年，我参加了周扬在上海工人文化宫召开的工人业余文艺积极分子座谈会。
    周扬在这个会上，胡说什么“所有的作品，不要都写机器、开会，看戏不是来看机器、开会的”，“现在有些作品，都是一片轰隆轰隆的机器声”。这不是明目张胆地反对我们工人的文艺创作吗？
    我们工人生活在工厂里，战斗在机器旁，我们工人不写机器声，不写开小组会，谁来写？我们工人阶级对新中国的机器声最有感情！新中国的机器声，就是用毛泽东思想武装了的工人阶级改变祖国面貌、向地球开战的歌声！就是三大革命斗争向前飞跃的脚步声！机器声是我们工人阶级向党向毛主席高唱赞歌的心声！机器声是我们中国工人阶级支援世界革命的战鼓声！只有阶级敌人，才害怕新中国的革命机器声；只有周扬这一伙反革命修正主义分子，才会反对我们的革命机器声。我们不但要写，而且要大写、特写，永远写下去！周扬一伙反对我们写机器声，不过是几只苍蝇的嗡嗡乱叫，掩盖不住我们革命机器的隆隆声响！
    周扬反对我们写开小组会，也是别有用心的。我们的小组会是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂；是我们工人树雄心、立大志，充分发挥集体才智的讲台；更是阶级斗争的阵地！革命的小组会，为什么不该写！周扬反对我们写机器声、小组会，说穿了，就是反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，反对写我们工人阶级的战斗生活！
