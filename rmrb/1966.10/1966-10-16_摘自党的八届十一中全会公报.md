Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era. Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new and higher stage. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism for the era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory.
