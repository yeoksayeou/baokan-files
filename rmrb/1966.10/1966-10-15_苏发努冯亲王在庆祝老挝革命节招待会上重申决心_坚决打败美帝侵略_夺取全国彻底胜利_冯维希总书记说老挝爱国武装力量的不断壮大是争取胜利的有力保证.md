Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, reiterated his determination to decisively defeat American aggression and achieve complete national victory at a reception celebrating the 21st anniversary of the Lao Revolution.

Vice Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, Kaysone Phomvihane, said that the continuous growth of the Lao patriotic armed forces is a powerful guarantee for winning victory.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on October 13, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a reception in the province of Sam Neua on the evening of October 11 to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the Lao Revolution.

Prince Souphanouvong, in his speech at the reception, pointed out that October 12 marks the demise of imperialism and colonialism in Laos and the beginning of a new era for the Lao people to struggle for independence and freedom. The great victories achieved by the Lao people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation have laid a solid foundation for continuing the revolutionary struggle and ultimately achieving complete victory nationwide. They are determined to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of October 12, and to give a heavy blow to American imperialism and the reactionary forces in Laos.

Vice Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, Kaysone Phomvihane, Central Committee members Tham, Lo Fon, Aphi Choummaly, Khamphai Boupha, Sithane Sithat, and representatives from various departments of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee and the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command attended the reception.

In his speech, Prince Souphanouvong spoke about the great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic military and civilians in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. He said that the vast majority of the Lao people have awakened, distinguishing between friends and enemies, uniting as one, and resolutely refusing to be slaves of American imperialism. We now have liberated areas covering two-thirds of the national territory and half of the population. These liberated areas are currently being built and consolidated, becoming a strong base for resisting American aggression and building a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

He said, "We have an increasingly expanding and consolidated anti-American national united front, in which the alliance between the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces is becoming increasingly solid in the struggle to defeat the American aggressors to the end."

Prince Souphanouvong pointed out that the Lao patriotic armed forces are growing and strengthening in the midst of the battle. He said, "In the twelve years of resisting American interference, aggression, and sabotage, our army has annihilated 71,774 enemy troops and shot down 431 aircraft. We also have a cadre force that is continually growing in numbers and quality, capable of leading the revolution forward on the correct path. Internationally, our revolutionary forces are gaining increasing prestige and receiving increasingly strong sympathy and support from the governments and peoples of peace-loving countries around the world."

Prince Souphanouvong strongly condemned that American imperialism and its lackeys are launching a creeping attack on northern Laos in the late rainy season, preparing to deploy the Kong Le forces to launch a new attack on the Phou Kout Mountain area and the Xieng Khouang Plain, strengthening bandit activities, and conducting large-scale "sweeps" in the provinces of Vientiane and central and southern Laos. They are also using aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, to bomb the liberated areas indiscriminately. He said, "The enemy's above-mentioned actions mark the beginning of escalating the American 'special war' to a higher level, while continuing to create conditions for the entry of the American army into Laos, expanding the American war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula."

Prince Souphanouvong emphasized, "Currently, the situation in Laos will become more serious. However, under any circumstances, we will not retreat. The more crimes the enemy commits, the greater our fighting determination will be. We will carry forward the immortal spirit of October 12 and resolutely give them heavy blows."

According to a broadcast by the "Voice of Laos" radio station, the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee's representative in Kheang Khao, the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Leadership Committee, and the Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Armed Forces jointly held a reception in Kheang Khao on the afternoon of October 12 to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the Lao Revolution.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Hanoi on October 13, the General Secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front, Phoumi Vongvichit, wrote in an article in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" on October 12 to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the Lao Revolution: The Lao people are not afraid of hardship or sacrifice and are determined to fight a long-term battle and fight to the end until they completely defeat American imperialism's interference and aggression in Laos.

The article pointed out that the continuous growth of the Lao patriotic armed forces is a powerful guarantee for completing the military tasks of the Lao people's patriotic struggle. After more than twenty years of liberation struggle, the Lao people have a powerful armed force that has developed from guerrilla units into a strong people's liberation army. The militia and guerrilla forces have also been widely developed. The growing Lao patriotic armed forces have shot down more than 400 American aircraft in the past two years. In the dry season alone this year, they have conducted more than 400 battles, annihilated nearly 7,000 enemy troops, seized more than 3,000 weapons of various kinds, and achieved brilliant victories. The Lao liberated areas have become a solid base for the Lao people's long-term struggle. In the past decade alone, the liberated areas have expanded from the two provinces gathered by the Lao Patriotic Front to a vast area covering two-thirds of the national territory and half of the population.

    苏发努冯亲王在庆祝老挝革命节招待会上重申决心
    坚决打败美帝侵略　夺取全国彻底胜利
    冯维希总书记说老挝爱国武装力量的不断壮大是争取胜利的有力保证
    据新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮电台十三日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王十一日晚上在桑怒省举行招待会，热烈庆祝老挝革命节二十一周年。
    苏发努冯亲王在招待会上发表讲话指出，十月十二日革命节标志着帝国主义和殖民主义在老挝的灭亡，揭开了老挝人民争取独立和自由的新纪元。老挝人民在抗美救国斗争中获得的巨大胜利，为继续进行革命斗争、进而在全国范围内夺取彻底胜利打下了良好的基础。他们决心发扬十月十二日的革命精神，坚决给予美帝国主义和老挝反动派以沉重的打击。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席凯山·丰威汉，中央委员提门、洛丰、阿菲·乔奔亨、坎派·布法、西沙纳·西山等以及老挝爱国战线党中央和老挝人民解放军最高指挥部各部门的代表出席了这次招待会。
    苏发努冯亲王在讲话中谈到了老挝爱国军民在抗美救国斗争中取得的伟大胜利。他说，老挝绝大多数人民已经觉悟起来，分清了谁是朋友，谁是敌人，团结一致，决心不再当美帝国主义的奴隶。我们有了占全国面积三分之二和全国人口二分之一的解放区。解放区目前正在得到建设和巩固，成为抗美救国和建设一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝的强大根据地。
    他说：“我们有着日益扩大和巩固的抗美民族统一战线，其中老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量之间的联盟，在为战胜美国强盗而斗争到底的事业中日益巩固。”
    苏发努冯亲王指出，老挝爱国武装力量正在战火中成长和壮大。他说：“仅在反对美国及其走狗的干涉、侵略和破坏的十二年中，我们的军队就歼敌七万一千七百七十四名，击落飞机四百三十一架。我们还有着在数量和质量上不断壮大的干部队伍，有能力领导革命在正确的道路上前进。在国际上，我们革命力量的威信日益增加，得到全世界爱好和平的各国政府和人民的日益有力的同情和支持。”
    苏发努冯亲王强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗正在雨季后期对老挝北部发动蚕食进攻，准备出动贡勒部队对富科特山地区和查尔平原发动新的进攻，加强土匪的活动，在万象省和中、下寮地区展开大规模“扫荡”，并用包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的飞机对解放区进行狂轰滥炸。他说：“敌人的上述行动揭开了把美国的‘特种战争’加强到更高的程度的序幕，同时继续为美国陆军进入老挝，把美国的侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那创造条件。”
    苏发努冯亲王强调说：“目前，老挝的局势将变得更加严重。但是，不管在什么情况下，我们也决不后退。敌人犯下的罪行越多，我们的战斗决心就越大。我们将发扬十月十二日不朽的精神，坚决给予它们沉重的打击。”
    据“老挝之声”电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会驻康开代表、老挝爱国中立力量领导委员会和爱国中立武装力量指挥部，十二日下午在康开联合举行招待会，庆祝老挝革命节二十一周年。
    据新华社河内十三日电　老挝爱国战线党总书记富米·冯维希为纪念老挝革命节二十一周年在十二日的越南《人民报》上发表文章说：老挝人民决不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，坚决进行长期的战斗，坚决打到底，直到彻底打败美帝国主义对老挝的干涉和侵略。
    文章指出，老挝爱国武装力量的日益成长是完成老挝人民的爱国斗争的军事任务的有力保证。经过二十多年的解放斗争，老挝人民手中已经有了一支从游击队发展成为强大的人民解放军的武装力量。民兵、游击队也广泛发展。日益成长的老挝爱国武装力量，近两年来已经击落美国飞机四百多架，仅在今年的旱季中就进行了四百多次战斗，歼敌近七千名，缴获各种武器三千件，取得了辉煌的胜利。老挝解放区已经成为老挝人民进行长期斗争的稳固根据地。仅在最近的十年间，解放区已经从老挝爱国战线党集结的两个省扩大到占有全国三分之二的土地和二分之一人口的广大地区。（附图片）
