    Beijing, October 8 -- The Chinese leadership has received a congratulatory telegram from Chairman Shuqairi of the Palestine Liberation Organization on the occasion of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    In his message, Shuqairi, on behalf of the Palestinian people, extended his heartfelt congratulations to the heroic Chinese people and wished China prosperity under the great leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. He said in his telegram: "The Palestinian Arab people, who are preparing to welcome the liberation of their homeland from imperialism, colonialism, and Zionism, hold this national day of yours in esteem and hope, because it recalls the smashing of aggression and occupation, symbolizing the freedom and independence that our people yearn for. The ever-strengthening ties between our two peoples and our frequent meetings indicate that the struggle for freedom in the world is an indivisible whole."
