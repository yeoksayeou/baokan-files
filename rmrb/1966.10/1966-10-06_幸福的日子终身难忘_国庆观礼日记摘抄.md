Today, Comrade Wang informed me that I would be going to Beijing to observe the National Day celebrations. I really don't know how to express my feelings! The great Party, the wise Chairman Mao, it is you who have given me everything.

In recent years, under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, I have come to understand some principles of serving the people and have done some things that I should have done. These deeds are like a drop of water in the ocean, like a grain of sand on the beach. Yet the Party and the people have encouraged me time and time again, recognizing me as an outstanding worker and a model for studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, I am being called to the heart of our great motherland—Beijing—to observe the National Day celebrations. Truly, the heavens are vast, the earth is vast, but nothing compares to the Party's kindness. Father and mother are dear, but they cannot compare to Chairman Mao.

September 27

On the train to Beijing, my heart is surging like the waters of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. I never dreamed that this day would come. In the old society, I was a miserable child who begged for food for many years, suffering endless humiliation and oppression from the exploiting classes. Who saved me from this sea of suffering? It was the Party, it was Chairman Mao. Thinking of this, I hung the portrait of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, in the most prominent place in the carriage, so that everyone can see him every day. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we cannot live for a moment without you!

September 28

Around ten in the morning, we arrived in the capital, at the side of Chairman Mao.

We sang loudly, "The ship sails on the sea guided by the helmsman, all things grow with the sun." The more we sang, the more energetic we felt, the clearer our eyes became, and the brighter our hearts. Singing and singing, I couldn't help but look again and again at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on my little shoulder pole (Comrade Yang Huaiyuan always carries his little shoulder pole to serve the passengers, no matter where he goes—Editor), silently wishing: Chairman Mao, may you live forever!

September 29

Today, we received thrilling news: on October 1st, all the representatives will go up to Tiananmen Rostrum to be received by Chairman Mao. Together with everyone else, I raised my arm and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao! You truly understand our hearts. My greatest wish in coming to Beijing is to see you with my own eyes and to greet you!

I am as happy as a child, wearing a clean set of clothes and neatly pinning on the Chairman Mao badge. My heart is full of words I want to say to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world have you, what great happiness this is!

September 30

Today, I am especially excited, and I can't write my diary. I can only express my unquiet heart with a rhyme:

On the thirtieth night, I can't sleep,
I've looked at the clock several times,
Why hasn't the time come yet?
At four twenty in the morning, I got up,
Urging the clock to move, waiting for dawn,
Let me see the sun early.

The sun is Chairman Mao,
The sun is the Communist Party.
A red sun rises in the east,
People of all ethnic groups are joyful,
Striding forward with big steps,
To see our most red sun in our hearts.

The sun is Chairman Mao,
The sun is the Communist Party.

October 1

My long-cherished wish has come true. Today, I finally saw our great leader, Chairman Mao. We stood on Tiananmen Rostrum, by the side of our most beloved Chairman Mao, for three hours and two minutes. This is the most unforgettable moment of my life. I will turn this happiness into a great force. I will study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently and forever follow our most beloved leader in revolution.

At this unforgettable moment, I want to sing:

I walked to Chairman Mao's side,
He is so healthy.
His face is radiant like the rising sun,
Vigorous and warm, kind and benevolent.
I am so moved that tears well up in my eyes,
This happy moment will be remembered forever.
I wish I could look at him for just one more second,
Why can't this precious time be doubled?

I kept shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"
Wishing our great leader eternal life!

    幸福的日子终身难忘
    ——国庆观礼日记摘抄
    上海轮船公司民主五号轮副政委　杨怀远
    一九六六年九月二十四日
    今天，王队长通知我，让我上北京参加国庆观礼。我真不知道怎样说才好！伟大的党，英明的毛主席啊，是您给了我一切。
    这几年，在党和毛主席的教育下，使我懂得一些为人民服务的道理，做了一些应该做的事情。这些事，像大海里的一滴水，像海滩上的一粒砂。可是党和人民一次又一次地鼓励我，评我为五好职工和学习毛主席著作标兵。现在又叫我到伟大祖国的心脏——北京参加国庆。真是天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲比不上毛主席亲。
    九月二十七日
    在去北京的火车上，我的心就像长江黄河的流水一样翻滚，做梦也想不到有今天。在旧社会，我是个讨了多年饭的苦孩子，受尽了剥削阶级的欺侮和压迫。是谁把我这个苦孩子从水深火热之中救出来？是党，是毛主席。想到这里，我就把最敬爱的领袖毛主席像挂在车厢里最显眼的地方，让大家天天见到他老人家。毛主席啊，毛主席，我们一时一刻也离不开您呀！
    九月二十八日
    上午十点多钟，我们来到了首都，来到了毛主席的身边。
    我们高唱“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。”我们越唱越有劲，越唱眼睛越明心越亮，唱着，唱着，我不由得把挂在小扁担（杨怀远同志不管走到那里，总是带着他为旅客服务的小扁担——编者）上的毛主席像看了又看，默默地祝愿：毛主席啊，祝您老人家万寿无疆！
    九月二十九日
    今天，我们得到了一个激动人心的消息：十月一日，全体代表要上天安门城楼，接受毛主席的接见。我和大家一起，一次又一次地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席啊！您真了解我们的心，我来到北京最大的愿望，就是想要亲眼看到您老人家，向您问好！
    我高兴得像孩子一样，换上了一套洗得干干净净的衣服，端端正正地戴上了毛主席纪念章。我心里有千言万语要对毛主席说：毛主席呀，中国人民和全世界革命人民有了您，这是多大的幸福啊！
    九月三十日
    今天，我特别激动，记不成日记了，只好用顺口溜来表达难以平静的心情：
    三十夜里睡不着，
    一夜看了几次表，
    怎么时间还没到？
    四点二十分起床了，
    催表走，等天明，
    让我早点见太阳。
    太阳就是毛主席，
    太阳就是共产党。
    一轮红日升东方，
    各族人民喜洋洋，
    迈开大步向前走，
    去见我们心中最红最红的红太阳。
    太阳就是毛主席，
    太阳就是共产党。
    十月一日
    我多少年来的心愿实现了，今天终于见到了伟大的领袖毛主席。我们在天安门城楼上，在最最敬爱的毛主席的身边，整整呆了三小时零两分钟，这是我终身最难忘的时刻。我要把这幸福，化作巨大的力量。我要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，永远跟着我们最最敬爱的领袖闹革命。
    在这令人难忘的时刻，我要歌唱：
    我走到毛主席的身旁，
    他老人家多么健康。
    满面红光就像初升的太阳，
    神采奕奕，温暖又慈祥。
    我激动得热泪盈眶，
    幸福的时刻终身难忘。
    我多么想再看上一秒钟，
    宝贵的时间，为什么不能加倍延长？！
    我一个劲儿高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    祝伟大领袖万寿无疆！
