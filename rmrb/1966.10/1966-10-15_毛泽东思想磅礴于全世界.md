The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought gives confidence, strength, and direction to the oppressed peoples of the world. Revolutionary people around the globe are widely studying Chairman Mao's works and using Mao Zedong Thought to wage revolutionary struggles. Mao Zedong Thought is like a thunderous spring storm, shaking the earth and resounding across the world.

I am a typesetter for a party newspaper. This honorable job brings me immense inspiration and happiness every day. Every day, through our hands, we spread Mao Zedong Thought and the victories achieved by the Chinese people using Mao Zedong Thought to the world, inspiring the peoples of the world. At the same time, we also spread the achievements of the world's peoples in learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought to China, inspiring the Chinese people.

Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth that applies everywhere, a beacon guiding the world's revolutionary peoples forward. On the front lines of the anti-American national salvation war in South Vietnam, the heroic people "deeply feel that Chairman Mao's great military thought is invincible." The freedom fighters in Africa regard Mao Zedong Thought as food, weapons, and a compass. Friends from Latin America also enthusiastically sing its praises: "Wherever the people take up arms, there is Mao Zedong's guidance." Even in the United States and the Soviet Union, the people there continually raise voices of admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. Every time I read these inspiring messages, I deeply feel how great the power of Mao Zedong Thought is!

The spread of Mao Zedong Thought makes the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries tremble with fear. They shout and curse, trying to block it. But the light of truth cannot be stopped. The more they curse Mao Zedong Thought, the faster and wider it spreads across the world. The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are lifting stones to drop on their own feet. They oppress the people everywhere and do all kinds of evil. The result is that the more severe the oppression, the more intense the resistance, and the more Mao Zedong Thought is spread, the more flowers it blooms, and the more fruits it bears.

Chairman Mao said: "The just struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." He also said: "Since the birth of imperialism, the monster, the affairs of the world have become interconnected, and it is impossible to separate them." Now, Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more widely across the world, and more and more revolutionary peoples of the world are arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. This further strengthens the battle unity between the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary peoples in thought. A friend from Myanmar expressed the common wish of the world's peoples: Not only the 700 million people of China, but also the nearly 3 billion people of the world, in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reaction, "need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought." The world revolutionary forces united by the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world—Mao Zedong Thought—will surely overturn the old world with the force of a thunderbolt and create a new world without imperialism! Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

### 毛泽东思想磅礴于全世界

    毛泽东思想磅礴于全世界
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给全世界被压迫人民以信心、力量和方向。全世界革命人民正在广泛地学习毛主席著作，运用毛泽东思想进行革命斗争。毛泽东思想像迅猛的春雷，震响大地，磅礴于全世界。
    我是党报的一个排字工人。这个光荣的工作，每天都给我带来莫大的鼓舞和幸福。每天通过我们的手，把毛泽东思想和中国人民运用毛泽东思想取得的胜利，传播到全世界，鼓舞全世界人民，同时，也把世界人民学习和运用毛泽东思想的成就，传播到中国，鼓舞中国人民。
    毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是指导世界革命人民前进的灯塔。在抗美救国战争前线的越南南方英雄儿女，“深深体会到毛主席的伟大军事思想是战无不胜的”。非洲的自由战士们，把毛泽东思想看作是粮食、武器和方向盘。来自拉丁美洲的朋友也热烈歌颂：“哪里有人民拿起武器，哪里就有毛泽东的教导。”即使在美国和苏联，那里的人民，也不断发出敬仰毛泽东思想的欢呼声。每读到这一切令人振奋的消息时，我都深深感到，毛泽东思想的威力是多么伟大啊！
    毛泽东思想的传播，使帝、修、反怕得要死。它们大叫大骂，进行封锁。但是，真理的光芒是挡不住的。毛泽东思想被骂得越凶，在全世界传播得就越快越广。帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，都是搬起石头砸自己的脚。它们到处压迫人民，做尽坏事。结果是，哪里的压迫最厉害，哪里的反抗也就越激烈，哪里的毛泽东思想也就越是得到传播，开的花越茂盛，结的果越丰硕。
    毛主席说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”他又说：“自从帝国主义这个怪物出世之后，世界的事情就联成一气了，要想割开也不可能了。”现在，毛泽东思想在全世界越来越广泛地传播，越来越多的世界革命人民用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，这就进一步使中国人民和世界革命人民的战斗团结，在思想上更加巩固起来了。缅甸朋友说出了世界人民的共同心愿：不仅中国七亿人民，全世界近三十亿人民，在反对帝、修、反的斗争中，“也需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”用当代最高水平的马列主义——毛泽东思想统一起来的世界革命力量，定将翻江倒海，以雷霆万钧之力，把旧世界砸个稀烂！创建一个没有帝国主义的新世界！伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
