On September 16, we arrived in Beijing, a city we had long yearned to visit.

Beijing, everywhere is a vast red ocean of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Every household has a portrait of Chairman Mao, and everywhere you go, you hear quotations from Chairman Mao. Promoting Mao Zedong Thought has become a mass activity.

After getting off the train, while waiting at the gate of the Xiannongtan Stadium, a six or seven-year-old boy brought us some water and immediately recited several quotations from Chairman Mao. We asked, "Little friend, why do you recite Chairman Mao's quotations for people?" He tilted his head and said, "To let Mao Zedong Thought bloom in everyone's heart!"

"Let Mao Zedong Thought bloom in everyone's heart!" Over the past ten days, we have felt this powerful voice everywhere in Beijing.

On the trams and buses that crisscross the city and suburbs, people are reciting quotations from Chairman Mao. Once, on a bus, a blind boy of about ten years old recited several quotations from Chairman Mao and the first point of the "Sixteen Points" for us. He recited them so fluently and accurately that we were amazed.

On the bus, groups of schoolchildren lead the recitation of Chairman Mao's quotations and sing revolutionary songs. These respectable and lovable little revolutionaries, the oldest being only about ten, and the youngest not even ten, organize themselves to promote Mao Zedong Thought. Some of them get up at four in the morning, groping in the dark to the station, eating only a steamed bun they brought with them for lunch. Many little revolutionaries have been engaged in this activity for quite some time. Two young Pioneers from Dongfanghong Primary School, aged eleven or twelve, have been conducting propaganda work on the buses for a month.

The little revolutionaries, in order to promote Mao Zedong Thought well, recite Chairman Mao's quotations dozens of times in advance. Many can recite forty or fifty quotations from Chairman Mao at a time. Even so, the little revolutionaries still seek and humbly accept the opinions of revolutionary comrades on the bus.

The little revolutionaries' activity has received strong support from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Beijing. Two young Pioneers from Heping Street Primary School told us that their parents often teach them how to promote Mao Zedong Thought. The bus drivers and ticket sellers also enthusiastically help them. The spirit of the little revolutionaries enthusiastically promoting Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved us outsiders. Many of our comrades on the bus also learned from them, using their unskilled Mandarin to recite quotations from Chairman Mao and lead revolutionary songs.

These are just one aspect of the Beijing people's enthusiastic promotion of Mao Zedong Thought. Through this aspect, doesn't it vividly reflect the profound changes in our great capital?

    到处是毛主席的声音
    九月十六日，我们来到了日夜向往的北京。
    北京，到处是一片《毛主席语录》的红色海洋，家家有毛主席像，处处有毛主席语录，宣传毛泽东思想成了群众性的活动。
    我们下火车以后，在先农坛体育场门外候车，一个六、七岁的男孩送来开水，马上就给我们背诵了几段毛主席语录。我们问：“小朋友，你为什么要给人读毛主席语录呀？”他头一扬，说：“让毛泽东思想在每个人心里开花结果呗！”
      “让毛泽东思想在每个人心里开花结果！”十多天来，我们在北京到处都感受到这个强大的声音。
    在市区和郊区奔驰的电车上、汽车上，都有人在宣读毛主席语录。有一次，在汽车上，一个双目失明的十多岁的孩子，为我们背诵了几段毛主席语录，又背诵了十六条的第一条。他背得那样流利、准确，使我们感到十分惊奇。
    在车上，三三五五的小学生，领读毛主席语录，领唱革命歌曲。这些可敬可爱的小将，大的不过十多岁，小的甚至还不上十岁，他们自动组织起来宣传毛泽东思想。他们有的在凌晨四点钟就起床，摸着黑来到车站，中午吃一个自己带来的馒头。许多革命小将坚持这项活动已经有相当长的时间。东方红第一小学的两个十一、二岁的红领巾，已经随车作了一个月的宣传工作。
    革命小将们为了宣传好毛泽东思想，事前十遍百遍地诵读毛主席语录。许多人一口气就能背诵四、五十段毛主席语录。尽管这样，小将们还是不断征求和虚心接受车上革命同志的意见。
    革命小将们的这项活动，受到了北京广大工农兵群众的积极支持。和平街小学的两个红领巾告诉我们，他们的爸爸妈妈常教他们如何去宣传毛泽东思想。车上的司机叔叔、售票员阿姨，也都热心地帮助他们。革命小将热情宣传毛泽东思想的精神，深深感动了我们这些外地人。我们好多同志在车上也学习他们，操着不熟练的普通话，宣读毛主席语录，领唱革命歌曲。
    这些，不过是北京人民热情地宣传毛泽东思想的一个侧面。通过这一侧面，不是生动地反映了我们伟大首都的深刻变化吗？
