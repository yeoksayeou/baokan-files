Among the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the heroic battle against the inferno at the 32111 drilling team, there was a young driller who, even as the flames of the fire took his life, maintained the heroic posture of reaching out with both hands to close the valve. This young driller was the Communist Youth League member Wang Ping.

Three days before his martyrdom, Wang Ping had just been transferred from another drilling team to work at the 32111 team. It was on the night of June 19th. The command center of the mine urgently notified him to rush to a location 90 miles away to support the 32111 team in changing the wellhead before dawn. Time was of the essence, and he didn't even have time to change his clothes. He grabbed Chairman Mao's works and a quotation board and set off. This young man from a poor peasant family was an exemplary oil worker in the 3216 drilling team. He was infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and faithfully carried out Chairman Mao's highest directive to find gas and oil. People found in his diary that he had written:

"After hearing the instructions of Chairman Mao, I can no longer sit still. I don't care about anything else; I will risk my life to find a large gas field here, to reassure the Party and Chairman Mao, and to reassure the Chinese people and the people of the world."

Once, while working on a gas well, a sudden strong blowout occurred. Natural gas mixed with mud and sand sprayed out more than 20 meters high. These sand particles, if they hit the derrick and sparked, would ignite a raging fire.

At that time, Wang Ping was in the dormitory attending a meeting. Upon hearing the emergency alarm, he was the first to rush to the well site. As soon as he rushed onto the platform, he was blown down by the powerful gas flow. He climbed back up, determined to control the wellhead at all costs. While struggling with the gas flow, he shouted, "Comrades, now is the time for us to completely and thoroughly serve the people. We must capture the 'gas tiger'!" Under his leadership, everyone rushed forward and quickly controlled the blowout.

However, the natural gas sprayed out by the "gas tiger" was like a thick cloud covering the well site. When the concentration of natural gas in the air reaches a certain level, it will explode. Once an explosion occurs, the entire well site and the lives and property of nearby village residents will be seriously threatened. At this time, the only effective measure was to burn the natural gas outside the vent pipe. However, to go and ignite the natural gas to burn it, one had to risk one's life. The on-site commander asked, "Who will go to light the fire?" Wang Ping immediately volunteered: "I will go." Everyone saw him, like a soldier storming a fortress on the battlefield, with the determination of "with me, no enemy," bravely and wisely approaching the vent pipe, and igniting the natural gas. Afterward, someone asked him why he was not afraid of death. He replied, "If you are afraid of death, you won't revolutionize; if you revolutionize, you won't be afraid of death. As long as it is for the people, even if it means climbing a knife mountain or entering a sea of fire, I am willing."

Every heroic revolutionary fighter grows by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Wang Ping was no exception. He not only tirelessly armed himself with Mao Zedong Thought but also enthusiastically helped his comrades around him to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. After his martyrdom, many people took out the quotation boards he had given them and, with tears in their eyes, said, "Comrade Wang Ping, we will keep the Chairman Mao quotations you personally copied for us for a lifetime, use them for a lifetime, and we will be beneficial to the people for a lifetime..."

One night, the squad leader Xu Shibin returned to the dormitory and saw a quotation board hanging on the bedhead, on which was written: "Our comrades must understand that the work of ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and painstaking task..." Whose was this? He went to ask Wang Ping. Wang Ping bluntly replied, "It's mine. Squad leader, I have some opinions about you. Recently, your work has not been thorough, and you criticize comrades without fully understanding the facts before 'firing.' You are the squad leader and cannot do things according to Chairman Mao's instructions. How can you set an example for the masses?" Xu Shibin felt that Wang Ping's words were very pertinent. Looking back at the quotation board on the bedhead, he felt inexplicably ashamed. From then on, he made up his mind to overcome this shortcoming.

Wang Ping's life was not affluent, but he always found ways to save some money to buy Chairman Mao's works to give to his comrades. This year in April, ten half-working, half-studying students came to the class. Some of them were not accustomed to the hard life in the mountains and had some ideological problems. Wang Ping, to help them progress, took a detour to the city's New China Bookstore while on a business trip, buying each of them a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Type A)." When the students received the books, some were so moved that they had tears in their eyes, saying, "Comrade Wang Ping cares so much about us. We must study Chairman Mao's works well and become red and expert revolutionary successors."

Wang Ping, from a child who suffered from class oppression, became a hero of the Mao Zedong era, completely as a result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, many workers recall Wang Ping and think of his touching scenes of diligently studying Chairman Mao's works.

One night, squad leader Xu Shibin went to inspect the beds and found that a faint light was coming from Wang Ping's mosquito net. He was studying "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" by the battery lamp. The squad leader said with concern, "Wang Ping, it's already past one o'clock, why aren't you sleeping?" Wang Ping said, "Chairman Mao instructs us to find gas and oil here. Oil and gas are taken by people, and people are taken by studying Chairman Mao's works. Picking up this book is like having Chairman Mao by my side. Now I am consulting him to quickly capture the gas field and support the construction of the motherland and the world revolution."

For a period of time, Wang Ping suffered from a stomach ailment, turning his face green and sweating coldly. He still insisted on studying. Comrades advised him to rest, but he said, "Reading Chairman Mao's books can increase the strength to fight against illness." Therefore, comrades praised him as an "iron man, steel-made person," a "worker like Jiao Yulu."

On the night of June 21st at 11 PM, just two hours before Wang Ping's heroic sacrifice, he was in the dormitory engrossed in studying Chairman Mao's "On the Chongqing Negotiations." He read the book while talking to the person next to him, Feng Mingyuan, "In a while, when we go to work, I am assigned to watch the wellhead device, which is the most critical and dangerous place. This is the Party's test of us. We must face the challenge calmly and flexibly, 'resolutely, fearlessly, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory.'"

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai." Comrade Wang Ping is such a person. His death is heavier than Mount Tai. He is indeed a good soldier of Chairman Mao and a good son of the people.

    胸中永远装着革命
    ——记石油工业部五好标兵、护井英雄王平烈士
    在32111钻井队血战火海时光荣牺牲的烈士中，有一位青年司钻直到烈火夺去了他的生命，仍然保持着伸出双手抢关闸门的英勇姿态。这位青年司钻就是共青团员王平。
    王平同志牺牲前三天，才从另外一个钻井队调到32111队工作。那是六月十九日深夜，矿区指挥部紧急通知，要王平在天亮以前赶到九十里外支援32111队抢换井口。时间非常紧迫，他连换洗衣服都来不及，手里拿了毛主席著作和语录牌就出发了。这位贫农出身的共青团员，在原先工作的3216钻井队就是一个好样的石油战士。他无限忠于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠诚地执行着毛主席关于找气找油的最高指示。人们在他的日记里发现他曾经写着：
    “听了毛主席他老人家的指示，我再也坐不住了。我什么也不顾了，豁出命来，也得在这里找出大气田来，让党和毛主席放心，让中国人民和世界人民放心。”
    有一次，他所在工作的一口气井，突然发生强烈井喷。天然气夹着泥浆、砂石，喷出二十多米高。这些砂石一旦打在井架上迸出火星，就会燃起冲天大火。
    当时王平正在宿舍开会，听到紧急警报，第一个跑到井场。当他刚一冲上井台，就被强大的气流顶了下来。顶下来再爬上去，死活也得控制住井口。他一面和气流搏斗，一面大声呼唤：“同志们，现在是我们完全彻底为人民服务的时候了，一定要活捉‘气老虎’！”在他的带领下，大家一拥而上，很快地控制住了井喷。
    但是“气老虎”喷出来的天然气，像滚滚的浓云，笼罩着井场。天然气在空气中增加到一定比例就会发生爆炸，一旦发生爆炸，整个井场和附近农村社员的生命财产，就要受到严重威胁。这时，唯一有效的措施是在放喷管外把天然气烧掉。但是要去点火把天然气烧掉，必须冒着生命危险。现场指挥员问大家：“谁去点火？”这时王平应声而出：“我去。”只见他像战场上炸碉堡的战士一样，抱着有我无敌的决心，机智勇敢地接近放喷管口，点燃了天然气。事后有人问他为什么这样不怕死？他回答说：“怕死就不革命，干革命就不怕死。只要为人民，那怕上刀山，进火海，我也心甘情愿。”
    每个英雄的革命战士，都是靠活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己而成长起来的。王平也是这样。他不仅自己努力不懈地用毛泽东思想武装着自己，而且热情地帮助周围的同志认真学习毛主席著作。在他牺牲后，很多人拿出他生前送的语录牌，一字一泪地说：“王平同志，我们要把你亲手抄写的毛主席语录，保存一辈子，用一辈子，我们要做一辈子有益于人民的人……”
    一天晚上，指导员徐世彬回到宿舍，看到床头上挂了一块毛主席语录牌，上面写着：“我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作……”
    这是谁挂的？他去问王平。王平开门见山地回答：“是我挂的。指导员，我对你有些意见。最近你的工作有些不深入，批评同志，还没有弄清事实就‘开炮’。你是指导员，不能很好地照毛主席的指示办事，咋给群众树榜样？”徐世彬觉得王平的话很中肯，回过头来，再看看床头上的语录牌，心里说不出的惭愧。从此他就下定决心，克服了这个缺点。
    王平的生活不算宽裕，可是他总千方百计地想办法节约一部分钱，买毛主席著作送给同志。今年四月，班里来了十个半工半读的学生。他们有些人对山沟里的艰苦生活不习惯，产生了一些思想问题。王平为了帮助他们进步，出差时，特地绕道去城里新华书店，给他们每人买了一套《毛泽东著作选读》（甲种本）。同学们接到书时，有的感动得热泪盈眶，说：“王平同志这样关心我们，我们一定要好好学习毛主席著作，做又红又专的革命接班人”。
    王平从一个受尽阶级压迫的苦孩子，成为毛泽东时代的英雄，完全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    如今，许多工人回忆起王平，就想起他刻苦学习毛主席著作的动人情景。
    一天深夜，指导员徐世彬到宿舍查铺，发现王平的蚊帐里透出微弱的灯光，他正在电池灯旁，聚精会神地学习《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》。指导员关切地说：“王平呀！已经过一点钟啦，还不睡觉？”王平说：“毛主席指示，要我们在这里找气找油。油和气靠人来拿，人靠学习毛主席著作。拿起这本书，就像毛主席在我身边，现在来请教他老人家，快点拿下气田，支援祖国建设和世界革命。”
    有一段时间，王平的胃病发作，疼得脸色发青，直冒冷汗，他还是坚持学习。同志们劝他休息，他说：“看了毛主席的书，可以增添跟病痛斗争的力量。”因此，同志们称赞他是“铁打的汉子、钢铸的人”，是“焦裕禄式的工人”。
    六月二十一日深夜十一点，也就是王平英勇牺牲前的两点钟，当时他正在宿舍里埋头学习毛主席《关于重庆谈判》这篇文章，他一面读书，一面对着旁边的冯明元说：“一会上班，我分工看封井器，是个最关键最危险的地方，这是党对我们的考验。我们一定要沉着应战，机动灵活，‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。王平同志就是这样的人，他的死比泰山还重。他不愧为毛主席的好战士，不愧为人民的好儿子。
