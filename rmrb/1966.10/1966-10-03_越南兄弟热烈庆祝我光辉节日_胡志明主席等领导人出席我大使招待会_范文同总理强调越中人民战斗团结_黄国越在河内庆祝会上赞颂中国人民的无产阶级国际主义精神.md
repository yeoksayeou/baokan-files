Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, Zhu Qifeng, held a grand reception on the evening of September 30 in Hanoi to warmly celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh and many other Vietnamese party and government leaders attended the reception.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong spoke at the reception. He first, on behalf of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people, extended the most sincere and warmest congratulations to the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people led by the respected Comrade Mao Zedong.

He said, the People's Republic of China has always been a close friend who wholeheartedly supports and aids oppressed nations, a staunch warrior against imperialism led by the United States, and a powerful country that unceasingly struggles for peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress. The various conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of all countries to oppose the People's Republic of China are doomed to fail.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong emphasized that the Vietnamese people are certain to win, and the U.S. imperialists are certain to lose, which is the inevitable trend of contemporary historical development. At present, while the U.S. imperialists are loudly advocating the deceptive slogan of "unconditional discussions" and plotting to use the United Nations as a tool for their policy of aggression against Vietnam, they are also intensifying preparations for a new and extremely dangerous "escalation" of the war in both South and North Vietnam. In response to Chairman Ho's sacred call, all compatriots in Vietnam are determined to fight to the end and decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, and will ultimately achieve victory.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, in the struggle against French colonialists and U.S. imperialists, and in the cause of socialist construction, the Vietnamese people have always received firm, enormous, and effective support and assistance from the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people. Currently, the "Support Vietnam, Resist America" movement in China is increasingly deeply rooted in the emotions of the Chinese people, in China's political life, and in all aspects of its activities. It is manifested in the profound and meaningful practical actions of thousands upon thousands of people from all walks of life in China, including workers, peasants, soldiers, students, intellectuals, youth, women, elders, and children.

Embodying the great unity of the 700 million Chinese people with our people, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have repeatedly expressed their firm support for Chairman Ho's July 17 call, supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation until final victory. This has further bolstered the confidence of the entire military and civilian population of Vietnam in their just struggle for victory. He said, the Vietnamese Labor Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people highly appreciate the enormous and invaluable role played by China's assistance in all aspects. This is a shining example of the lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism and the close revolutionary comradeship between the two parties and the two peoples of Vietnam and China.

Prime Minister Pham Van Dong said, in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people feel exhilarated to have such a close brother and comrade-in-arms as the heroic Chinese people, and a strong rear base and reliable support as the great People's Republic of China.

He concluded by proposing a toast to the eternal friendship between the peoples of the two countries, to the long life of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the long life of Chairman Ho.

Before Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's speech, Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, Zhu Qifeng, first addressed the reception. He said, on the occasion of celebrating our national day, our great socialist motherland is today stronger and more consolidated than ever before. The country is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere, and a new comprehensive leap forward is emerging. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Ambassador Zhu Qifeng emphasized: Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, a powerful weapon for the invincible struggle of revolutionary people. The Chinese people have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and China will prosper and be invincible. The people of the world will be able to achieve complete liberation by grasping Mao Zedong Thought. This is why all reactionary forces are most afraid of and hate Mao Zedong Thought, while revolutionary people all over the world regard Chairman Mao as their outstanding leader and have an unlimited love for Mao Zedong Thought.

Ambassador Zhu Qifeng continued: The heroic 31 million Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, are united and fighting bravely, displaying the might of revolutionary people, and are advancing from victory to victory, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world.

Zhu Qifeng said, the Chinese government and the Chinese people most enthusiastically and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call for resistance against American aggression for national salvation. The 700 million Chinese people have already made all preparations and are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end, until they achieve final victory in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation. The reception was filled with a warm atmosphere of combat friendship between the two countries.

When Chairman Ho Chi Minh and other Vietnamese party and government leaders, including Le Duan, Le Duong, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Hoang Van Hoan, Van Tien Dung, Phan Khe, Nguyen Chi Thanh, Nguyen Dinh Thuan, Tran Do, Tran Quoc Hoan, Nguyen Thi Binh, and various representatives of the Vietnamese People's Army and local militia heroes, entered the venue, they were warmly welcomed by Ambassador Zhu Qifeng and all the diplomatic staff of the embassy, as well as the entire delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association led by Qu Mengjue. The reception began with the playing of the song "The East Is Red."

The speeches by Ambassador Zhu Qifeng and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong repeatedly sparked enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 29, representatives of various sectors of the people of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, held a grand meeting on the evening of September 29 at the Hanoi Grand Theater to warmly celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Huang Quoc Viet, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, chairman of the General Federation of Labor, and president of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, and Qu Mengjue, head of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association delegation, spoke at the meeting.

Huang Quoc Viet said: "The Chinese Communist Party is loyal to the ideals of communism and the cause of peace. It has been and is now tenaciously and resolutely defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, consistently holding high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and actively fighting against imperialism and old and new colonialism, especially against the most vicious enemy of humanity, U.S. imperialism. The uncompromising stance of the Chinese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism inspires and greatly promotes the national liberation movement and revolutionary movement of the world. The Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the people have fulfilled their responsibilities and obligations, consistently and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries and all oppressed nations."

He went on to say, the Vietnamese people warmly congratulate the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in the past 17 years. These brilliant achievements are the results of the great 700 million Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the respected Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, displaying revolutionary spirit and the hardworking and brave spirit of labor.

He said, in the process of their revolutionary struggle, the Vietnamese people have always received firm, enormous, sincere, and timely support from the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people. The Chinese people, with their lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, have always stood by the Vietnamese people, thoroughly and wholeheartedly supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against the U.S. aggressors. Huang Quoc Viet said, U.S. imperialism is extremely hostile and fearful of the deepening and development of friendship between the two countries. "It is trying every means to create a rift between us. The Vietnamese people will never allow it to destroy this beautiful friendship, just as they will not allow it to destroy our homeland's mountains and rivers. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that no matter what happens, our two parties and peoples will always be brothers, comrades, and close comrades-in-arms."

In her speech, Qu Mengjue, head of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association delegation, introduced the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, and under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, on all fronts. She said, now, the whole country is filled with a revolutionary atmosphere, and a new comprehensive leap forward is emerging.

Qu Mengjue then praised the heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party, for displaying the mighty power of people's war and achieving great victories in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation.

After Qu Mengjue's speech, she presented a banner to the assembly. The banner read, "Long live the great friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

Attending the celebration were various Vietnamese officials, including Nguyen Duy Trinh, Nguyen Thi Binh, Sun Quang Phuc, Phan Ngoc Thach, Nguyen Van Tho, Nguyen Chi Thanh, and others.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, Zhu Qifeng, diplomatic staff of the embassy, and representatives of Chinese experts in Vietnam were also invited to attend the celebration.

    越南兄弟热烈庆祝我光辉节日
    胡志明主席等领导人出席我大使招待会　范文同总理强调越中人民战斗团结  黄国越在河内庆祝会上赞颂中国人民的无产阶级国际主义精神
    据新华社河内一日电  中国驻越南大使朱其文九月三十日晚上在河内举行盛大招待会，热烈欢庆中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    胡志明主席和越南许多党政领导人出席了招待会。
    范文同总理在招待会上讲话。他首先代表越南劳动党、越南政府和越南人民向以敬爱的毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民致以最亲切和最热烈的祝贺。
    他说，中华人民共和国是一贯全心全意支持和援助被压迫民族的亲密朋友，是反对以美国为首的帝国主义的坚强战士，是为和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步进行不懈地斗争的强国。美帝国主义和各国反动派反对中华人民共和国的种种阴谋活动是注定要失败的。
    范文同总理强调说，越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败，这是当代历史发展的必然趋势。目前，美帝国主义在大肆叫嚷“无条件讨论”的骗人论调和阴谋利用联合国作为美国侵越政策的工具的同时，正在对越南南方和北方加紧准备极其危险的新的战争“升级”。越南全国同胞响应胡主席的神圣号召，决战决胜，坚决打败美国侵略者，并将取得最后胜利。
    范文同总理说，越南人民在反对法国殖民主义者和美帝国主义的斗争中，在社会主义建设事业中，一贯得到中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民给予的非常坚决、非常巨大和非常有效的同情、支持和援助。目前，中国的“援越抗美”运动日益深刻地贯彻到中国人民的感情中、中国的政治生活和各方面的活动中。它在中国工人、农民、军队、学生、知识分子、青年、妇女、父老们和儿童们等各阶层人民的成千上万的具有深刻意义的实际行动中体现出来。
    体现伟大的七亿中国人民对我国人民的战斗团结，中国共产党和中国政府曾经多次表示坚决支持胡主席七月十七日的号召书，支持越南人民的抗美救国战争直到最后胜利。这更加有力地鼓舞了越南全国军民进一步加强对自己的必胜的正义斗争的信心。他说，越南劳动党、越南政府和越南人民高度地评价中国给予他们的各方面的援助所起的巨大和宝贵的作用。这是崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神、越中两党、两国人民亲密革命同志情谊的光辉表现。
    范文同总理说，越南人民在抗美救国斗争中以有着像英雄的中国人民这样的亲密兄弟和战友，有着伟大的中华人民共和国这样的大后方和坚强后盾而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    他最后建议为越中两国人民世代永恒的友谊，为毛泽东主席万寿无疆，为胡主席万寿无疆，干杯！
    在范文同总理讲话之前，我国驻越南大使朱其文首先在招待会上致词。他说，在庆祝我国国庆的时候，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，今天比过去任何时候都更加强大、更加巩固。全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，正在出现一个新的全面跃进的局面。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    朱其文大使强调说：毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是革命人民战无不胜的强大武器。中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，中国就兴旺，就无往而不胜。世界人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够得到彻底解放。这就是为什么一切反动势力最害怕、最仇恨毛泽东思想，而全世界革命人民把毛主席看作是自己杰出的领袖，无限热爱毛泽东思想。
    朱其文大使接着说：英雄的三千一百万越南人民在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下，团结一致，英勇战斗，显示了革命人民的威风，正在从胜利走向胜利，为世界革命人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    朱其文说，中国政府和中国人民最热烈、最坚决地支持胡志明主席的抗美救国的号召，七亿中国人民，已经作好了一切准备，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。招待会上洋溢着中越两国战斗友谊的热烈气氛。
    当胡志明主席和黎笋、长征、范文同、范雄、武元甲、阮维桢、黄文欢、文进勇、潘继遂、阮阐、陈登科、黄国越、阮氏十等越南党政领导人，以及越南人民军和民兵自卫队的战斗英雄们和各界代表步入会场的时候，受到朱其文大使和使馆全体外交人员，以及由区梦觉率领的中越友好协会代表团全体成员的热情欢迎，招待会开始，会场上奏起了《东方红》乐曲。
    朱其文大使和范文同总理的讲话不断激起了全场热烈的掌声。
    据新华社河内二十九日电　越南民主共和国首都河内市各界人民代表二十九日晚上在河内大戏院隆重集会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年。越南劳动党中央委员、祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、总工会主席、越中友好协会会长黄国越和中越友好协会代表团团长区梦觉在会上讲了话。
    黄国越说：“中国共产党忠于共产主义理想和维护和平事业，它已经并且正在顽强和坚决地捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，一贯高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，积极进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、特别是反对人类最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义的斗争。中国人民反对美帝国主义的不妥协的斗争的坚定立场，鼓舞和正在大力推动着世界民族解放运动和革命运动。中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和人民履行自己的责任和义务，始终一贯地全心全力地支持各国人民和各个被压迫民族的革命斗争”。
    他接着说，越南人民热烈祝贺中华人民共和国十七年来所取得的巨大成就。这些辉煌的成就是伟大的七亿中国人民在以敬爱的毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党正确领导下，发扬革命精神和勤劳、勇敢的劳动精神所取得的结果。
    他说，越南人民在自己的革命斗争过程中一贯得到中国共产党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民的坚决、巨大、真挚和及时的支持。中国人民发扬崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，一贯站在越南人民一边，彻底和全心全力地支持越南人民战胜美国侵略者。黄国越说，美帝国主义十分仇视和害怕越中两国友谊日益加深和发展。“它千方百计地企图在我们两国之间制造分裂，越南人民决不允许它破坏这一美好情谊，正如不许他们破坏我们祖国的山河一样。越南人民坚信，不管出现什么情况，我们两党和两国人民都永远是兄弟，是同志，是亲密的战友。”
    中越友协代表团团长区梦觉在讲话中，介绍了中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在各条战线上取得的伟大胜利。她说，现在，中国全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。
    区梦觉接着赞扬英勇的越南人民在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，发挥了人民战争的强大威力，在抗美救国斗争中取得的伟大的胜利。
    区梦觉讲话结束后，向大会赠送了一面锦旗。锦旗上写着“中越两国人民之间的伟大友谊和战斗团结万岁！”
    出席庆祝会的越南各方面负责人有阮维桢、阮氏十、孙光阀、范玉纯、严春庵、阮阐等。
    中国驻越南大使朱其文、使馆外交官员和在越南的中国专家代表等应邀出席了庆祝会。
