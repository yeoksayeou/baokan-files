Outside the rest rooms on both sides of the Tiananmen Rostrum, several comrades from the army saw Comrade Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man" of the Daqing Oilfield, and immediately went up to greet him, asking him to write some calligraphy. Wang Jinxi wrote neatly, "Learn from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army," which deeply moved everyone. Another representative attending the ceremony also asked him to write some calligraphy and said, "Please write some heroic words of the people of Daqing!" Wang Jinxi took up the brush and wrote:

	"When talking about progress, do not forget the Party;
	When talking about skills, do not forget the masses;
	When talking about achievements, do not forget the majority;
	When talking about shortcomings, do not forget yourself."

The comrade who received the calligraphy was very excited and said, "Excellent! I will definitely learn well from the people of Daqing, remember these precious words, and put them into action."

    一定向大庆人学习
    天安门观礼台两侧的休息室外，几位部队同志见到大庆油田的“铁人”王进喜同志来了，大家立即迎上去，请他题字。王进喜端端正正地写了“向解放军同志学习”几个字，这使同志们感动极了。另一位观礼代表也请他题字，并且说：“请写几句大庆人的豪言壮语吧！”王进喜同志提笔写道：
    “讲进步不要忘了党；
    讲本领不要忘了群众；
    讲成绩不要忘了大多数；
    讲缺点不要忘了自己。”
    这位同志接过题字后非常激动，说：“太好了！我一定很好地向大庆人学习，牢牢记住这些宝贵的话，并且落实到行动上。”
