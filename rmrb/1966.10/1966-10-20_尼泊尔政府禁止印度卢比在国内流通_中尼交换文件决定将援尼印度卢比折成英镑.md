Nepal Government Bans Indian Rupee from Circulating Domestically

	Nepal and China Exchange Documents Deciding to Convert Aid in Indian Rupees to Pounds

	Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, October 19th

	According to a news bulletin released on the 17th, the Nepalese government has decided that the Nepalese currency will be the sole legal tender in Nepal starting from the 17th.

	In accordance with this decision, the "Foreign Exchange Control Act" will be implemented nationwide to regulate foreign exchange, and the Indian Rupee will be prohibited from circulating in Nepal.

	Before 1960, Nepal practiced a "dual currency system," where both the Indian Rupee and the Nepalese Rupee circulated domestically. In reality, this was a system where the Indian Rupee was the main currency. This not only infringed upon Nepal's sovereignty but also brought serious harm to Nepal's economy, finance, banking, and price levels. In recent years, the Nepalese government has taken measures to limit the circulation of the Indian Rupee in Nepal and resist India's economic control over Nepal.

	Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, October 18th

	Chinese Ambassador to Nepal, Yang Gongsu, and Nepal's Economic Planning Department Secretary, Yadav Prasad Pant, exchanged documents on behalf of their respective governments in Kathmandu on the afternoon of the 18th regarding China's aid to Nepal. The document states that, in light of the friendly relations between Nepal and China, and to avoid the depreciation of the Indian Rupee from adversely affecting Nepal's independent economic development, the Chinese government agrees to convert the total amount of aid, specified in two economic aid agreements signed by China and Nepal in October 1956 and March 1960 respectively, from 160 million Indian Rupees to 12 million pounds, based on the gold standard of the Indian Rupee before its depreciation and the gold standard of the pound. The relevant banks of the two countries will convert the Indian Rupee accounts of the used and unused portions of the aforementioned funds into pound accounts.

	The Nepalese government issued a news bulletin in the afternoon of the 18th stating: "His Majesty's Government expresses its gratitude for the generous gesture of the Government of the People's Republic of China."

    尼泊尔政府禁止印度卢比在国内流通
    中尼交换文件决定将援尼印度卢比折成英镑
    新华社加德满都十九日电　据十七日发表的新闻公报说：
    尼泊尔政府决定，尼泊尔货币自十七日起成为尼泊尔全国唯一的法定货币。
    根据这一决定，在尼泊尔全国实行“外汇管制法”以管制外汇，印度卢比在尼泊尔全国禁止流通。
    一九六○年以前，尼泊尔实行“双重货币制”，印度卢比和尼泊尔卢比在国内同时流通，实际上这是以印度卢比为主要通货的制度。这不仅侵犯了尼泊尔的主权，而且给尼泊尔的经济、财政、金融、物价各方面带来严重的危害。近年来，尼泊尔政府曾采取措施限制印度卢比在尼泊尔的流通范围，抵制印度对尼泊尔的经济控制。
    新华社加德满都十八日电　中国驻尼泊尔大使杨公素和尼泊尔经济计划部秘书亚达夫·普拉沙德·潘特，分别代表本国政府在十八日下午在加德满都就中国给予尼泊尔援助的问题交换了文件。文件说，鉴于尼泊尔和中国的友好关系，为了避免印度卢比贬值对尼泊尔政府的独立经济发展产生不良影响，中国政府同意把中国和尼泊尔分别在一九五六年十月和一九六○年三月签订的两个关于经济援助的协定中规定中国提供的援助总额一亿六千万印度卢比，按照印度卢比贬值前的金本位和英镑的金本位之间的比率，折合成一千二百万英镑。两国有关银行将把上述款项已使用部分和未使用部分的印度卢比账目折成英镑账目。
    尼泊尔政府十八日下午发表新闻公报说：“陛下政府对中华人民共和国政府这种慷慨的表现表示感谢。”
