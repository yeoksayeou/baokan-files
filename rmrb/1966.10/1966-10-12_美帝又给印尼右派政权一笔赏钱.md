The U.S. government on September 30 again loaned the Indonesian right-wing military regime $26,350,000 to purchase 50,000 tons of rice and 150,000 bales of cotton. This is the second time this year that the U.S. government has given a boost to its lackey, the Indonesian reactionary regime, and is further tightening its control over Indonesia through this regime.

The Indonesian minister in charge of the economy, Buwono, attended the loan signing ceremony in Washington. He expressed satisfaction with this small favor from his American masters.

    美帝又给印尼右派政权一笔赏钱
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在九月三十日又贷给印度尼西亚右派军人政权两千六百三十五万多美元，让印尼反动派购买五万吨大米和十五万包棉花。这是美国政府今年以来第二次给它的走狗——印尼反动政权打强心针，并且通过这个政权加紧控制印尼。
    印尼当局主管经济的部长布沃诺在华盛顿出席了贷款的签字仪式。他对美国主子的这点赏赐表示满意。
