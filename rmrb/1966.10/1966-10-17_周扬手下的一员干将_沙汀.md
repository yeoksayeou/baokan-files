	Sanding, former chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, deputy secretary of the Party committee, and editor-in-chief of *Sichuan Literature*, is a key figure under the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang. He is a fervent advocate and loyal executor of Zhou Yang's bourgeois and revisionist literary line in Sichuan.

	Sanding has consistently opposed Chairman Mao's literary line, resisted the Party's leadership, and colluded with some anti-Party elements to control the literary and art circles in Sichuan. He has committed numerous anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes. In his speeches to Chengdu literary and art workers in September 1961 and June 1962, he systematically and vigorously promoted Zhou Yang's revisionist literary program, viciously attacking Chairman Mao's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. These two speeches fully exposed his anti-Party face.

	In 1957, Sanding published the poisonous novel *Fishing*, which not only viciously attacked the agricultural cooperativization movement and defamed socialist rural areas as "developing too slowly" with "cultural and entertainment life still as primitive"; it also maliciously portrayed the broad masses of rural youth, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, as extreme individualists who "always looked gloomy and thoughtful," yearning to leave the countryside. This novel was a poisoned arrow fired in support of the bourgeois rightists' attack. In 1958, he published another poisonous novel, *Storm*, which distorted the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in the countryside at that time. On one hand, he viciously defamed the poor and lower-middle peasants led by the Party, portraying those who resolutely took the socialist road as people in an "intermediate state" between socialism and capitalism, even siding with class enemies to "complain about the harm brought by the cooperative." He completely denied the revolutionary enthusiasm and class advantages of the poor and lower-middle peasants. He also defamed rural cadres as simple-minded, ignorant of policies, and only capable of "lying" to cope with the severe class struggle. On the other hand, he exaggerated the reactionary momentum of the class enemies, attempting to stir up a counter-revolutionary black tide to restore capitalism in our country.

	Sanding and his anti-Party clique also abused their power, acting behind the provincial Party committee, using illegal means to long suppress the revolutionary masses' correct criticism of Ma Shitu's poisonous novel *Choosing a Daughter-in-Law*.

    周扬手下的一员干将——沙汀
    前四川省文联主席、党组副书记、《四川文学》主编沙汀，是反革命修正主义分子周扬手下的一员干将，是周扬的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线在四川的狂热鼓吹者和忠实执行者。
    沙汀一贯反对毛主席文艺路线，抗拒党的领导，同一些反党分子结成一伙，把持四川文艺界，干了许多反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当。他在一九六一年九月和一九六二年六月向成都文艺工作者的两次讲话中，系统地、卖力地宣扬周扬的修正主义文艺纲领，恶毒地攻击毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。这两次讲话集中地暴露了他的反党面目。
    沙汀在一九五七年抛出毒草小说《摸鱼》，不仅恶毒地攻击农业合作化运动，污蔑社会主义农村“发展得太慢”，“文娱生活照样简陋”；而且把毛泽东思想哺育下的广大农村青年，丑化成一心一意追求安逸、舒适生活的极端个人主义者，“老是显出一幅愁闷和想心思的模样”，一心想离开农村。这篇小说，是他配合资产阶级右派进攻的一支毒箭。一九五八年，他又抛出毒草小说《风浪》，歪曲当时农村阶级斗争和两条道路斗争的形势。他一方面恶毒地丑化党领导下的贫农下中农，把坚决走社会主义道路的贫农下中农，污蔑为动摇于社会主义和资本主义之间的“中间状态”的人，甚至跟着阶级敌人“控诉合作社带给她的损害”，根本否定贫农下中农的社会主义革命积极性和阶级优势；把农村干部也丑化成头脑简单，不懂政策，在阶级斗争的严重时刻只有“扯谎”应付；另一方面，他又大肆渲染阶级敌人的反动气焰，妄图掀起一股反革命的逆风黑浪，在我国复辟资本主义。
    沙汀等一伙反党分子还利用职权，背着省委，采取非法手段，长期压制革命群众对马识途的毒草小说《挑女婿》的正确批判。
