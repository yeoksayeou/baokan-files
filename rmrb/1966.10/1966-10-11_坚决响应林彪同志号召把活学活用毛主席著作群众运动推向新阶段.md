Comrade Lin Biao recently called on us to adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the new situation of the entire Party and nation studying Chairman Mao's works. He urged us to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army to a new stage.

Comrade Lin Biao said, the army must truly become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought must be held higher than ever before. The study of Chairman Mao's works must be further intensified, with greater emphasis on implementation, to create a new situation and reach a new level. All comrades should exert their utmost efforts to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao's directive sets higher requirements for the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that is currently being carried out in our army. It timely points out the direction for our army to continue advancing on the path of revolutionization. We must enthusiastically and resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call.

Currently, we are in a new era of world revolution and a new stage of socialist revolution in our country. The situation of class struggle at home and abroad is constantly changing. To adapt our thinking to the new situation and fulfill the mission history has entrusted to us, we must study and master Mao Zedong Thought. We must strive to learn better each year. We should not stagnate or be complacent, but should continue to advance, improve, develop, summarize new experiences, and achieve new breakthroughs and harvests.

Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, the truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, the most practical Marxism-Leninism, and the unified action program for the entire Party, army, and people of the nation. In opposing imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and in building socialism and a powerful revolutionary army of the proletariat, we rely solely on Mao Zedong Thought. The work of our army, despite its complexity and the vast differences among various units, is simple and uniform in this regard: we must grasp the fundamental, core, and essence of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thinking and actions of all personnel.

The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army has been ongoing for several years. For the majority of units and comrades, the main issue now is not whether we have studied or not, but whether we have truly studied and whether we truly know how to apply it. Truly studying and truly knowing how to apply it is our goal for further efforts.

The purpose of studying Mao Zedong Thought is to apply it, and the key to mastering Mao Zedong Thought lies in its application. Only when we know how to apply it can we say we have truly learned it. We must focus on the application.

Application means combining theory with practice, with thought, and with work. It means using Mao Zedong Thought to raise the class consciousness, policy level, and thinking methods of cadres and soldiers, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide and promote the revolutionization of our army's thinking and work.

Only by combining theory with practice can we understand, remember, and apply it.

By combining theory with practice, studying repeatedly, and applying repeatedly, we will not fear repetition and will not repeat ourselves. We will understand Mao Zedong Thought more deeply and apply it more skillfully.

As long as we combine theory with practice and focus on application, we will definitely achieve new results, new innovations, and new developments, and definitely reach a new level.

Comrade Lin Biao has always been the most loyal, resolute, and thorough in implementing Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out Chairman Mao's correct line. At major historical junctures of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Lin Biao has always stood firmly with Chairman Mao, waging uncompromising struggles against various "Left" and right erroneous lines, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. Since taking charge of the Military Commission, he has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, creatively applying Mao Zedong Thought, and proposing a series of major measures to strengthen the revolutionization of our army. He called on our army to launch the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, achieving great results and inspiring the entire nation to study Chairman Mao's works. He is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, best student, and a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

All comrades in the army should take Comrade Lin Biao as an example, and like him, always unswervingly study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieving greater victories in the revolutionization and combat readiness of our army.

    坚决响应林彪同志号召把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段
    林彪同志最近号召我们，要适应我国无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，适应全党全国大学毛主席著作的新形势，把我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，提高到一个新的阶段。
    林彪同志说，军队一定要真正成为毛泽东思想的大学校。毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定要比过去举得更高。毛主席著作的学习，一定要进一步抓紧，更讲究落实，要出现新的局面，提高到新的水平。全体同志都应当尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。
    林彪同志的这一指示，对我军正在深入开展的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，提出了更高的要求，及时地指出了我军在革命化建设道路上继续前进的方向。我们要热烈地、坚决地响应林彪同志的号召。
    当前，我们正处在世界革命的一个新时代，处在我国社会主义革命的一个新阶段。国内外阶级斗争的情况在不断地变化。我们要使自己的思想适应新的情况，要完成历史赋予我们的使命，就必须学习和掌握毛泽东思想。要一年比一年学得更好。不应该停留，不应该自满，而应该继续前进，应该提高，应该发展，应该总结新的经验，应该有新的创造，新的收获。
    毛泽东思想是革命的科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的真理，是当代发展到最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是最现实的马克思列宁主义，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领。我们反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和各国反动派，我们建设社会主义，建设强大的无产阶级革命军队，都只有靠毛泽东思想。我军的工作尽管复杂，各单位的情况尽管千差万别，但在这一点上，又不复杂，又没有差别，这就是，都必须抓住活学活用毛主席著作这个根本，这个核心，这个灵魂，都要用毛泽东思想来统一全体人员的思想，统一全体人员的行动。
    我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，已经持续几年了。就大多数单位、大多数同志来说，现在主要不是有没有学的问题，而是有没有真正学到，是不是真正会用的问题。真正学到，真正会用，这就是我们进一步努力的目标。
    学习毛泽东思想的目的全在于用，掌握毛泽东思想的关键也在于用。只有会用了，才算是学到了。我们一定要在用字上狠下功夫。
    用，就是要结合实际，就是要结合思想，结合工作，就是要用毛泽东思想来提高干部战士的阶级觉悟、政策水平和思想方法，用毛泽东思想来指导和推动我军的思想革命化和工作革命化。
    结合实际，才能学得懂，记得住，用得上。
    结合实际，反复学，反复用，就不怕重复，也不会重复，就会对毛泽东思想理解得越来越深，运用得越来越熟。
    只要结合实际，在用字上狠下功夫，就一定会有新的收获，新的创造，新的发展，就一定可以提高到新的水平。
    林彪同志一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地贯彻毛泽东思想，执行毛主席的正确路线。在中国革命的重大历史关头，林彪同志总是坚定地站在毛主席一边，同各种“左”的右的错误路线进行不调和的斗争，英勇地捍卫了毛泽东思想。他主持军委工作以来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造性地运用毛泽东思想，提出了加强我军革命化建设的一系列重大措施。他号召我军开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，取得了极大的效果，推动全国掀起了一个工农兵学习毛主席著作的群众性热潮。他是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，是活学活用毛主席著作的典范。
    全军同志都应当以林彪同志为榜样，像他那样始终不渝地学习、贯彻、传播和捍卫毛泽东思想。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，使我军的无产阶级革命化、战斗化建设取得更大的胜利。
