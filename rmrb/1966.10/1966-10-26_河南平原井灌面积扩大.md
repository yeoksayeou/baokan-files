    The vast numbers of cadres and community members in the plain regions of Henan Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seized the revolutionary initiative, promoted production, and rapidly expanded the area irrigated by wells. This has enhanced their ability to resist drought, and this year they have achieved bumper harvests in both the summer and autumn seasons.

    From last October to this August, in the plain regions of Henan Province, in addition to repairing over 210,000 old wells, they have drilled nearly 49,000 new mechanized wells reaching depths of 30 meters, and over 93,000 waterwheel wells reaching depths of about 10 meters. The quality of these new wells is better than in previous years.

    河南省平原地区广大干部和社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，井灌面积迅速扩大，增强了抗旱能力，今年取得了夏秋两季丰收。
    从去年十月到今年八月，河南省平原地区除修复旧井二十一万多眼外，新打三十米深的机电井四万九千多眼，十米左右深的水车井九万三千多眼。这些新的打井，质量都比往年好。
