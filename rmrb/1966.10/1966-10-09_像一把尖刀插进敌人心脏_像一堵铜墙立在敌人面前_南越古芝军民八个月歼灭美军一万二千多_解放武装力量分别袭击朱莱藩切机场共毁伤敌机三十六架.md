The heroic military and civilian people of Go Cong County in South Vietnam have demonstrated the power of people's war, repeatedly foiling the U.S. aggressors' numerous raids. In the first eight months of this year, they annihilated over 12,000 U.S. troops, destroyed 592 enemy vehicles, and shot down or damaged 174 enemy aircraft.

Go Cong County is only 30 kilometers away from the U.S. puppet regime's stronghold of Saigon. The U.S. aggressors' repeated invasions have all been repulsed by the brave military and civilian people of Go Cong County, who have sent them fleeing in disarray.

To further promote the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and to carry forward the brilliant achievements already made, the military and civilian people of Go Cong County recently held their third "Heroes Who Annihilate the Americans" celebration. Attending the celebration were representatives from six "units that annihilate Americans," 224 "heroes who annihilate Americans," 68 "heroes who annihilate armored vehicles," and many "heroes who annihilate American aircraft." After exchanging experiences, the representatives unanimously vowed to continue fighting bravely, to produce while fighting, and to strive for greater victories in all aspects.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 8th: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam, on the night of September 21st, once again fiercely bombarded the U.S. military airfield at Chu Lai, destroying or damaging 30 U.S. jet aircraft, and annihilating over 250 U.S. pilots, technicians, and combat personnel.

	In this brilliantly executed attack, the liberation armed forces received active support from the people, secretly approaching the U.S. military airfield, and with precise artillery fire, fiercely bombarded the parking apron and barracks area, turning the entire airfield into a sea of fire. The explosions shook the heavens, and the flames reached the sky.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, October 7th: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces of Phu Yen Province in South Vietnam, on the night of September 26th, once again fiercely attacked the enemy military airfield at Phan Rang, destroying 6 enemy aircraft and 2 cannons.

	At the same time, the liberation armed forces also fiercely assaulted an enemy stronghold near the airfield, annihilating two enemy companies.

	This was the third attack this year by the liberation armed forces of Phu Yen Province on the Phan Rang airfield. In these three attacks, they have destroyed 12 enemy aircraft, 3 vehicles, and 3 cannons, and burned 350,000 liters of gasoline.
