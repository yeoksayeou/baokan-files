Benzene

Benzene is one of the important basic raw materials in the chemical industry. The production of explosives, synthetic rubber, synthetic fibers, paints, plastics, pesticides, dyes, and medicines, among other things, cannot do without it. The amount of benzene a country produces is closely related to the balanced development of its national economy and national defense construction.

Benzene and ethylene can be synthesized into styrene, and styrene and butadiene can be copolymerized to form butadiene-styrene rubber. Butadiene-styrene rubber is a material used in tire manufacturing. Styrene is also the raw material for polystyrene, an important industrial and daily-use plastic. Polystyrene has excellent transparency and insulation properties and is widely used.

Benzene can be converted into phenol (carbolic acid) through various methods. In addition to being a raw material for the pharmaceutical and dye industries, phenol is also the raw material for phenolic plastics. Phenolic plastics are important electrical insulation materials. The high-explosive trinitrophenol (picric acid) used in national defense and industrial mining is also made from phenol.

Benzene can also be synthesized into nylon, caprolactam, and other synthetic fibers through various methods. These synthetic fibers are not only materials for clothing but also, due to their superior wear resistance, heat resistance, and corrosion resistance compared to natural fibers, have wide applications in national defense and industry.

Pesticides and insecticides such as "DDT" and "BHC" (benzene hexachloride) are primarily made from benzene. Currently, the production of "BHC" cannot meet agricultural needs, mainly because the supply of benzene is insufficient.

The source of benzene has traditionally relied on the by-products of the coking industry. In countries with developed petroleum industries, benzene can also be obtained during the petroleum refining process. Due to the rapid development of the chemical industry, especially the synthetic materials industry, the demand for benzene is increasing, and many countries are facing a shortage. In China, the source of benzene has traditionally relied on the by-products of the coking industry. Recently, China has also begun to establish petroleum catalytic reforming industries, which can obtain a certain amount of benzene products from petroleum. However, with the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, the demand for benzene is also increasing daily, and it is still not enough to meet the needs. Shanghai's relevant research units, in cooperation with sister units, have successfully experimented with synthetic methods to obtain benzene, opening up a new path for China to increase benzene production.

    苯
    苯是化学工业重要的基本原料之一，制造炸药、合成橡胶、合成纤维、涂料、塑料、农药以及染料、医药等等都不能缺少它。一个国家苯的产量多少，对国民经济的均衡发展以及国防建设有很大的关系。
    苯与乙烯合成苯乙烯，苯乙烯和丁二烯共聚合成丁苯橡胶。丁苯橡胶是制造轮胎的材料。苯乙烯又是聚苯乙烯的原料，聚苯乙烯是一项重要的工业及日用塑料，它具有优良的透光和绝缘性能，用途很广。
    苯可以通过不同方法，制成苯酚（石炭酸），它除作为医药、染料工业的原料外，又是酚醛塑料的原料。酚醛塑料是一项重要的电气绝缘材料。国防和工矿常用的烈性炸药苦味酸也是用苯酚制成的。
    苯也可以通过不同途径合成尼龙、卡普纶等合成纤维。这些合成纤维不仅是衣着服装材料，由于它们具有超过天然纤维的耐磨、耐热、耐腐蚀等性能，在国防和工业方面有广泛的用途。
    “六六六”、“滴滴涕”等农药和杀虫剂都以苯为主要原料。目前“六六六”的生产远远不能满足农业需要，主要就是因为苯的供应还跟不上。
    苯的来源，过去一般依靠炼焦工业的副产品；石油工业发达的国家在石油加工过程中，也可取得苯类产物。由于化学工业，尤其是合成材料工业的迅速发展，苯的需要量越来越大，许多国家都感到供不应求。我国苯的来源，过去完全依靠炼焦工业的副产品，近来，我国也开始建立石油铂重整工业，可以从石油中取得一定数量的苯类产品。但是，随着工农业生产的飞速发展，苯的需要量也与日俱增，仍然不能充分满足需要。上海有关研究单位在兄弟单位的协作下，试验成功用合成方法取得苯，为我国增产苯开辟了一条新的途径。
