We must guard our posts at all times, dare to struggle, and dare to win. We must be responsible to the Party and the people. We are workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and even if we encounter danger, we must guard our posts and fear no sacrifice for the revolution.

		——Zhang Yongqing

We must not be afraid of anything in our revolutionary work. If we have fear in our hearts, we cannot do our revolutionary work well.

We work for the interests of the people and fight for the happiness of the revolutionary people of the world. If our work and struggle require us to die, we should be able to face it without changing our expression or our heart rate.

I want to do things that benefit the people, benefit the Party's cause, benefit the work, and benefit everyone's progress. I have only one thought: to be loyal to the Party, to socialism, and to communism!

		——Wang Ping

In such a large country, based on needs, you are assigned to this post, and someone else is assigned to that post. This is the division of labor in society; it is not for someone to go where they want or do what they want. Whatever post you are assigned to, all work is for the revolution.

		——Lu Huatai

We are here to serve the people, so we should not be afraid of troubles. The more troublesome the task, the more we should do it. This is the most basic attitude of serving the people.

		——Deng Mugen

We must do our work well. Every task we undertake must be done with a sense of responsibility to the people. We must always have high standards and strict requirements.

		——Wang Zuming

Our responsibility is to the people. The people entrust us with tools, believing in us. We have the duty to take good care of them and no right to lose them. A worker losing a tool is like a soldier losing a weapon.

		——Wu Zhongqi

I was seriously injured (my eyes were injured by natural gas), and I cannot see or work, which makes me very upset. The struggle is so intense; can a revolutionary just sit idle? No! Red seeds will sprout in any soil, and the spark of revolution will shine at any time. Communist Party members cannot be defeated by injuries or illnesses. Revolutionary ideals must never be abandoned. I cannot do much now, but I can still do ideological work. I organize injured comrades to learn from Comrade Wang Jie's deeds, encouraging them to overcome their pain and focus on treatment.

		——Zhang Zhongmin

My life is given by the Party, and every cell in my body belongs to the Party. As long as I am alive, I must get rid of all selfish thoughts and be a loyal tool of the Party. I can give up everything, but I cannot give up the interests of the Party.

I do not seek fame or personal gain, nor do I seek to be a model in evaluation meetings. I must not regard the Party and the people's cultivation of me as a means of personal advancement. We are here to liberate the people completely and work for the people's interests.

		——Wang Youfa

The Party is my mother. Whatever the Party needs me to do, I will do it; wherever the Party sends me, I will go. As long as the Party and the people need me, I am willing to sacrifice my life. Everything I have is given by the Party, and everything I have belongs to the Party!

		——Lei Hongbing

I will never forget the cruelty of the class enemy, nor will I forget the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao. The motherland is a great building, and I am just a brick. I will dedicate my life to the great cause of communism.

		——Huang Chenghou

    把革命利益当成第一生命
    我们每时每刻都要严守岗位，要敢于斗争，敢于胜利，我们一定要对党、对人民负责。我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头工人，即使遇到了危险，也要严守岗位，为革命不怕牺牲。
                  ——张永庆
    我们干革命就不能怕这怕那。心里揣个“怕”字，就干不好革命工作。
    我们是为人民利益工作的，是为全世界革命人民的幸福斗争的。如果工作和斗争需要我去死，就应当做到面不改色，心不跳。
    我要做一个有利于人民，有利于党的事业，有利于工作，有利于大家共同进步的人。我就是长着一个心眼，一心向着党，向着社会主义，向着共产主义！
                  ——王平
    在这样大的国家里，根据需要，你在这个工作岗位上，他在那个工作岗位上，这是社会的分工；不能谁想在这里就在这里，谁想在那里就去那里，或者愿干这个，不愿干那个。安排你在那里你就在那里，一切工作都是为了革命。
                  ——罗华太
    我们是为人民服务的，因此就不要怕麻烦，越麻烦的事越要去做，这是为人民服务最基本的态度。
                  ——邓木全
    我们干工作一干就要干好，每做一件事情都要向人民负责，时刻都要有高标准、严要求的思想才行。
                                  ——王祖明
    我们的责任是向人民负责。人民把工具交给我管，是相信我，我有义务把它保管好，没有权力把它丢失。工人丢失了工具，就像战士丢失了武器。
                ——吴仲启
    身受重伤（眼被天然气刺伤），看不见事物，不能劳动，心里很难受。斗争这样紧张，做一个革命者，能这么闲下去吗？不能！红色种子在任何土壤都要发芽，革命的火种在任何时候都要发光，共产党员是伤不倒，病不垮的。革命理想在任何时候都不能丢掉。我现在做不了别的，但还可以做思想工作。我组织伤员学习王杰同志的事迹，鼓励他们战胜伤痛，安心治疗。
                                ——张仲珉
    我的生命是党给的，我身上每一个细胞都是属于党的。只要我活着，就要丢掉头脑里所有的私心杂念，永远做党的驯服工具。我能舍弃自己的一切，就是不能舍弃党的利益。
    不为名，不为利，不为评比会上争先进，更不能把党和人民对自己的培养当作个人升级的本钱。我们是为了彻底解放人民、为人民的利益工作的。
                              ——王有发
    党是我的母亲。党需要我做什么，我就去做什么；党叫我到那里，我就到那里。只要党和人民需要，就是献出生命我也心甘情愿。我的一切都是党给我的，我的一切都是属于党的！
                              ——雷洪炳
    我永远不能忘掉阶级敌人的凶残，不能忘掉党和毛主席的恩情。祖国是一座大厦，而我是一块砖瓦，我一定要把自己的一生献给伟大的共产主义事业。
                              ——黄成厚
