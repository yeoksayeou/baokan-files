A pair of new mine shafts—Jiaojiazhai level shafts—at Xuan'gang Coal Mine in Shanxi Province have recently been completed and put into production.

The level shafts have a designed annual production capacity of 600,000 tons. They are entirely designed and constructed by China, with all equipment supplied by domestic manufacturers. The level shafts have a high degree of mechanization. The joint trial production conducted before the official handover proved that the engineering quality is qualified and the equipment operates normally.

    轩岗煤矿建成一对新矿井
    山西轩岗煤矿新建的一对矿井——焦家寨平硐已经在最近建成并且投入生产。
    这对平硐设计年生产能力六十万吨。它是我国自己设计，自己施工，设备也是自己制造供应的。矿井生产的机械化程度很高。在正式移交前进行的联合试生产证明，工程质量合格，设备运转正常。
