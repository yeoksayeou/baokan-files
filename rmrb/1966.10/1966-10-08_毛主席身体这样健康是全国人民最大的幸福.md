He said: This year, the vast number of commune members in the countryside across the nation have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, and achieved great victories on both the ideological and material fronts. This year, the entire agricultural front has seen a nationwide and comprehensive leap forward, with major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, tobacco, tea, hemp, silkworm cocoons, and fruits all achieving bumper harvests.

Comrade Tan Zhenlin encouraged everyone to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, build on the foundation of this year's harvest, and strive for an even greater harvest next year.

This is the greatest honor and happiness of our lives! Seeing Chairman Mao so healthy made us incredibly happy. This is the greatest happiness for the people of the nation and the people of the world!"

They said, "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must, like the PLA, widely propagate and study Mao Zedong Thought, make the people's communes across the nation into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought. We must learn from the heroic 32111 Drilling Team, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings; imprint Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, dissolve it in our blood, and implement it in our actions, truly making Mao Zedong Thought our soul."

They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call, expressing their strong support for the revolutionary actions of revolutionary youth, and vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that the proletarian ironclad mountains and rivers will never change color!

They expressed their determination to take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key task, grasp both revolution and production, and channel the surging enthusiasm unleashed by the cultural revolution into production struggles and scientific experiments. They pledged to ensure bumper harvests this year and strive for even greater harvests next year, to strive for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan of the state, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

The reception was filled with revolutionary enthusiasm. The representatives repeatedly raised their bright red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

After the reception, the representatives watched the song and dance epic "Blood Battle in the Sea of Fire" praising the heroic 32111 Drilling Team, and toured the Great Hall of the People.
