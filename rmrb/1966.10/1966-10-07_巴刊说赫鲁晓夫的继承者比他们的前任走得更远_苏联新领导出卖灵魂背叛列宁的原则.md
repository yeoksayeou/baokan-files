A recent issue of the monthly magazine *Programme* published in Karachi, Pakistan, carried an article pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership, under the pretext of "peaceful coexistence," has betrayed all Marxist-Leninist principles. Khruchev's successors have gone even further than their predecessors.

The article says: The attitude of the Soviet leaders towards the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression is the same as their attitude towards the national liberation struggles of all peoples. It completely violates the principles of proletarian internationalism.

The article says: "Therefore, despite the fact that the U.S. is carrying out aggressive activities in Vietnam, the Soviet leaders are still negotiating with American imperialism on agreements regarding disarmament and the peaceful use of outer space."

The article says: "Khruchev's successors have raised many protests against the U.S. bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, but when we see that the Soviet Union avoids direct confrontation with the U.S. over its support for Vietnam, the true nature of these protests is exposed."

The article points out that today's Soviet leaders have sold out their souls and abandoned the principles upheld by Lenin and Stalin.

The article says: The Soviet leaders raise the slogan of "joint action" against U.S. aggression in Vietnam, but behind the scenes, they are actively seeking to compromise with the U.S.

The Soviet leaders not only conspire against the peoples of socialist countries but also against the peoples of all countries in the world.

The article says, the current policies of the Soviet leaders provide a lot of support for the imperialist countries.

    巴刊说赫鲁晓夫的继承者比他们的前任走得更远
    苏联新领导出卖灵魂背叛列宁的原则
    新华社拉瓦尔品第五日电　在巴基斯坦卡拉奇出版的最近一期《纲领》月刊发表文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团在所谓“和平共处”的幌子下，背叛了一切马克思列宁主义原则。赫鲁晓夫的继承者比他们的前任走得更远。
    文章说：苏联领导人对待越南人民反对美国侵略斗争的态度同它对待各国人民的民族解放斗争一样，完全违反无产阶级国际主义原则。
    文章说：“因此，尽管美国在越南进行侵略活动，苏联领导人仍然在同美帝国主义进行关于签订裁军与和平使用天体等协议的谈判。”
    文章说：“赫鲁晓夫的继承者对美国轰炸河内和海防提了不少抗议，但是当我们看到苏联避免同美国发生由于苏联支持越南而引起的直接冲突的时候，这种抗议也就真相毕露了。”
    文章指出，今天苏联领导人出卖了自己的灵魂，抛弃了列宁和斯大林所坚持的原则。
    文章说：苏联领导口头上提出对美国侵略越南采取“联合行动”的口号，但是背地里它大肆活动设法同美国妥协。
    苏联领导人不仅阴谋反对社会主义国家人民，而且反对全世界各国人民。
    文章说，苏联领导人目前的政策给帝国主义国家提供了很多的支持。
