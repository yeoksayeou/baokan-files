All of us revolutionary comrades solemnly pledge to our most beloved leader Chairman Mao: We will resolutely learn from the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, master Mao Zedong Thought, and transform our factory into one like the 32111 team. We are determined to implement the Sixteen Points and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will also apply the revolutionary spirit ignited during the Cultural Revolution to our production, striving for victory in both revolution and production. To achieve this revolutionary goal, we must read Chairman Mao's works every day, in everything we do, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We vow to turn our factory into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    争取革命生产双胜利
    我们全体革命同志，向我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席宣誓：坚决向三二一一一英雄钻井队的英雄们学习，把毛泽东思想学到手，把我们厂办成三二一一一队式的厂。我们决心按十六条办事，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。并把在文化大革命中焕发起来的革命干劲用到生产上去，争取革命生产双胜利。为了达到这个革命目标，我们一定要天天读毛主席的书，事事读毛主席的书，照毛主席指示办事，誓把我厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
