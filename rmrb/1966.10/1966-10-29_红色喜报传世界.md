	Red Joyous News Spreads Across the World

	Member Yin Guanglan

	Yin Guanglan, a renowned folk singer from Anhui Province and a poor peasant from Dianpu Commune in Feidong County, was ill when she heard the news of China's successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear warhead. She immediately got out of bed, dressed, and wrote a folk song celebrating the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The song goes as follows:

	The people of the whole nation raise the red flag,
	Launching missiles and nuclear weapons,
	Red joyous news spreads across the world,
	Songs of praise rise from the five lakes and four seas.

	Songs of praise rise from the five lakes and four seas,
	Highly singing the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought,
	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution bears fruit,
	The iron fortress of the country is unshakable!

	The red missile brings victory,
	The war drums of the five continents shake the heavens and the earth,
	The nuclear monopoly of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism,
	Is smashed into pieces!

    社员　殷光兰
    安徽省著名民歌手、肥东县店埠公社贫农社员殷光兰，正在生病，听到我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息，即披衣起床，写了一首高唱毛泽东思想新胜利的民歌，歌如下：
    全国人民举红旗，
    飞出导弹核武器，
    红色喜报传世界，
    五湖四海歌声起。
    五湖四海歌声起，
    高唱毛泽东思想新胜利，
    文化大革命结硕果，
    铁打江山坚无比！
    红色导弹传胜利，
    五洲战鼓震天地，
    美帝苏修核垄断，
    统统砸成稀烂泥！
