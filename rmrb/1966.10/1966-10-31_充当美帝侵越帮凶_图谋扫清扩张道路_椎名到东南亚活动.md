As U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was traveling to Asia to rally his henchmen in the aggression against Vietnam and to play the "peace talk" trick, intensifying the plot to expand the war in Vietnam, the Japanese government of Sato also dispatched Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina. From October 19 to 28, Shiina visited Thailand, Indonesia, "Malaysia," and Singapore.

During his visit, Shiina eagerly acted as the agent for U.S. imperialism's "peace talk" trick on the "Vietnam issue," serving the U.S. in its efforts to expand the war in Vietnam. In the joint communiqués issued after his talks with the Thai Thanom puppet regime, the "Malaysian" Rahman regime, and the right-wing military government of Indonesia, as well as in the press conferences he held in various places, Shiina arrogantly demanded that the Vietnamese people lay down their arms and "come to the negotiating table," advocating the use of so-called "peaceful means" to resolve the Vietnam issue. He even suggested that the right-wing military government of Indonesia, which is a lackey of U.S. imperialism, act as a "mediator." Before Shiina's visit to Southeast Asia, he had held secret talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk on the "Vietnam issue" and the "China issue."

During his visit to Southeast Asia, Shiina repeatedly emphasized the importance of "economic cooperation" and "regional cooperation," and boasted about Japan's "leadership position" in Asia. He also used "aid" as a bait to vigorously solicit Southeast Asian countries to participate in the "Southeast Asia Agricultural Development Conference," which is planned to be held in Tokyo in December and is orchestrated by the U.S. with the Japanese government taking the lead.

In his remarks to the press at the Kuala Lumpur airport, Shiina also revealed the Sato government's plot to rally for the U.S. imperialism's anti-communist alliance with Japan as the core. Shiina's activities fully exposed the Japanese reactionaries' role as henchmen of the U.S., and their attempt to use U.S. power to make a comeback, arrogantly seeking to realize their expansionist ambitions in Southeast Asia. This cannot but alert the Japanese people and the people of Asia to the seriousness of the situation.

    充当美帝侵越帮凶　图谋扫清扩张道路
    椎名到东南亚活动
    据新华社二十九日讯  正当美国总统约翰逊到亚洲纠集它的侵越帮凶玩弄“和谈”骗局，加紧策划扩大侵越战争的时候，日本佐藤政府也派出了外务大臣椎名悦三郎，在十九日到二十八日访问了泰国、印度尼西亚、“马来西亚”和新加坡。
    椎名在访问期间，极力充当美帝国主义在“越南问题”上的“和谈”骗局的掮客，为美国扩大侵越战争效劳。他在同泰国他侬傀儡集团、“马来西亚”拉赫曼集团和印度尼西亚右派军人政权的头目会谈后发表的联合公报中，以及在各地举行的记者招待会上，狂妄地叫嚷要“迫使”越南人民放下武器，“走到会议桌旁”，鼓吹用所谓“和平手段”解决越南问题。他甚至建议要美帝国主义的走狗印尼右派军人政权充当“调解人”。椎名这次到东南亚之前，曾同美国国务卿腊斯克就“越南问题”、“中国问题”进行过密谈。
    椎名在访问东南亚期间，一再鼓吹“经济协作”、“地区性合作”的重要性，并且自吹自擂地吹嘘日本在亚洲的“领导地位”。他还以“援助”为诱饵，特别卖力地招揽东南亚国家参加由美国策划并由日本政府出面，预定十二月在东京召开的“东南亚农业开发会议”。
    椎名在吉隆坡机场向报界发表谈话时，还透露了佐藤政府为美帝国主义拼凑的以日本为核心的“反共联盟”而奔走的阴谋。椎名的这些活动，充分暴露了日本反动派充当美国帮凶，并借助美国力量，卷土重来，妄图实现它在东南亚的扩张野心。这不能不引起日本人民和亚洲人民的严重警惕。
