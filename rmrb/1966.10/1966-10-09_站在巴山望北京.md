Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
The sun's rays shine brightly in the sky.
Though Mount Ba and Beijing are a thousand miles apart,
Mountains and rivers cannot separate our hearts.

Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
A sun rises in my heart.
The red light shines from Tiananmen Gate,
Chairman Mao smiles at us warmly.

Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
My heart is red, my eyes are bright, and I am full of energy.
We fear no difficulties in transforming mountains and rivers,
We dare to fight to change the heavens and the earth.

Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
We diligently build a new countryside.
Dazhai flowers bloom across Mount Ba,
Our sweat waters the earth anew.

Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
Our revolutionary spirit is boundless.
We trample underfoot the ghosts and snakes,
Our direction is clear as we march forward.

Standing on Mount Ba looking towards Beijing,
The revolution has a guiding light.
With a hoe in hand and a heart towards the Party,
Mount Ba is connected to Tiananmen Gate.

    站在巴山望北京
    四川达县草坝公社七大队业余创作组站在巴山望北京，霞光万道耀眼明，巴山北京万里远，隔山隔水不隔心。站在巴山望北京，胸中一轮太阳升，天安门上红光照，毛主席对咱笑盈盈。站在巴山望北京，心红眼亮浑身劲，治山治水不怕难，改天换地敢斗争。站在巴山望北京，勤奋建设新农村，大寨花开遍巴山，汗水浇得天地新。站在巴山望北京，革命志气长十分，牛鬼蛇神脚下踩，不断前进方向明。站在巴山望北京，革命有了指路灯，手拿锄头心向党，巴山连着天安门。
