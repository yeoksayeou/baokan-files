    The Strongest Voice of Our Era
    Capital Colleges and Universities Red Guards Headquarters Propaganda Department

    Amateur performers from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and with boundless love for Chairman Mao, have proudly stepped onto the stage of art. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes." However, it is infuriating that our stage has long been occupied by those bourgeoisie masters. They adopt a master's attitude, despise the workers, peasants, and soldiers, defame them, exclude them, and make the stage a mess of chaos.

    Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, has sounded the bugle call for us to march against the old world. Our amateur cultural warriors from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have thoroughly smashed bourgeois ideology, bringing a new atmosphere to the artistic stage.

    The amateur performers from the poor and lower-middle peasants of Hebei Province performed "Chairman Mao Wears the Green Uniform." The performers' eyes were filled with tears of happiness, as if they were speaking heart-to-heart with Chairman Mao. They poured out their hearts to the audience: "The mountains are high and the roads are long, but our will is firm and we do not fear hardships; the winds are strong and the rains are heavy, but our red hearts are forever with the Party. The revolutionary songs of the proletariat, we will sing with all our might, singing until the entire globe is red and bright!" What an open heart and what a magnificent spirit! In their performance, every word and sentence shines with the light of Mao Zedong Thought; every action reveals the deep class feelings of revolutionary people towards the Party and Chairman Mao; every note expresses the strongest voice of our era!

    We—Chairman Mao's Red Guards—enthusiastically acclaim the performances of the amateur troupes from the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    We—Chairman Mao's Red Guards—will forever take the workers, peasants, and soldiers as our examples, learning their spirit of "a red heart towards the Party, clear distinctions between love and hate, and high revolutionary will, daring to brave knife mountains and fire seas to plant the red flag all over the world!" We will forever be the red successors of the proletariat, the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause!

    我们时代的最强音
    首都大专院校红卫兵司令部宣传处
    工农兵业余演员们怀着把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心，带着对毛主席无比热爱的感情，昂首阔步，登上了艺术舞台，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄”。但是，令人气愤的是，我们的舞台长期被那些资产阶级老爷们霸占着。他们采取老爷式的态度，轻视工农兵，丑化工农兵，排斥工农兵，把舞台搞得乌烟瘴气。
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，他为咱们吹响了向旧世界进军的冲锋号。我们的工农兵业余文艺战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破资产阶级思想，使文艺舞台出现了一片新的气象。
    河北省贫下中农业余演员们表演的《毛主席穿上绿军装》，演员们个个眼里含着幸福的泪花，就好像在毛主席面前说着贴心话。他们向观众倾吐了内心的话：“山高路长，我们意志坚定不辞难；风大雨狂，我们颗颗红心永向党。无产阶级的革命战歌，我们要摽着膀子永远唱，一直唱到整个地球通通红，通通亮！”这是何等开阔的胸怀，何等磅礴的气概呵！在他们的节目里，字字句句都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光芒；每一个动作都表露着革命人民对党和毛主席无比深厚的阶级感情；每一个音符都表达了我们时代的最强音！
    我们——毛主席的红卫兵，热烈欢呼工农兵业余演出队的演出！
    我们——毛主席的红卫兵，要永远以工农兵为榜样，学习他们“一颗红心向着党，爱憎分明斗志昂，为把红旗插全球，刀山火海也敢闯”的革命精神！我们要永远作无产阶级的红色后代，作无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人！
