The Gansu Provincial Mass Art Troupe, rural cultural work team, and New China Bookstore have jointly formed a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought. They are accompanying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the construction sites and rural areas of Yongjing County, promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, holding picture exhibitions, supplying Chairman Mao's works and portraits, and teaching revolutionary songs. They have been warmly welcomed by the people.

Everywhere the propaganda team goes, people spread the news as if it were a major event, enthusiastically praising the team for bringing the voice of Chairman Mao and the sharp weapons of the Cultural Revolution. Many people, upon receiving Chairman Mao's works, excitedly said, "This is the precious book we've been longing for!" Some elderly poor peasants held Chairman Mao's portrait to their chests, their joy so great they could barely close their mouths. In just a few days, all the copies of Chairman Mao's selected works, individual volumes, portraits, and the "Sixteen Points" brought by the team were sold out.

The team's performances of small-scale operas praising Chairman Mao, the Party, and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee and the "Sixteen Points" were also highly popular among the masses. People universally praised them as "true revolutionary operas." Many workers and commune members wrote letters to the team late into the night to express their support and encouragement after watching the performances.

    送来了毛主席的声音
    甘肃一支毛泽东思想宣传队到工地农村活动
    据新华社兰州十三日电　甘肃省群众艺术馆、农村文化工作队、新华书店等单位，联合组成一支毛泽东思想宣传队，配合无产阶级文化大革命运动，到永靖县建设工地、农村，向群众宣传毛泽东思想，举办图片展览，供应毛主席著作和毛主席像，教唱革命歌曲，受到群众热烈欢迎。
    这支毛泽东思想宣传队每到一地，人们作为大喜事奔走相告，纷纷传颂宣传队送来了毛主席的声音，送来了文化大革命的锐利武器。许多人得到毛主席著作的时候激动地说：
  “我们最想念的宝书你们给送来了！”一些老贫农把毛主席像捧在胸前，高兴得嘴都合不拢。几天之间，宣传队带去的大批毛主席著作选读本、单行本、毛主席像和“十六条”等全部被购买一空。
    宣传队演出的歌颂毛主席，歌颂党，歌唱党的八届十一中全会公报和十六条的小型戏曲也深受群众欢迎。人们普遍称赞“这是真正的革命戏”。许多工人和社员看了演出后连夜给宣传队写信表示支持和鼓励。
