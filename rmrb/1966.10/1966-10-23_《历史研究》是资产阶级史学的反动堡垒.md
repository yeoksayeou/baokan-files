Editor's Note:

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the academic community has already exposed a small clique of anti-party, anti-socialist rightists and reactionary academic "authorities." Today, our newspaper exposes "Historical Research" magazine, which has long been occupied by them as a reactionary stronghold. Since the counter-revolutionary element Zhou Yang appointed his henchman Li Zhaozhou to serve as the chief editor of this magazine, they have used "historical research" as a cover to vigorously defend and spread the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. The poison has spread widely and harmed many people.

They spare no effort to drag people backward, to make people worship ancient people, worship emperors, generals, and officials, and to "evoke a longing for the past." They disguise the reactionary historical idealism of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie as "Marxist historical theory," attempting to use those rotten and moldy ideas to corrupt the masses and conquer hearts, in order to achieve their counter-revolutionary restoration goals. They also use the mouths of ancient people to viciously attack our new society. They use the method of "hitting the mulberry tree to curse the osmanthus" and "using the past to satirize the present," shamelessly opposing the party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletariat must resolutely counter the bourgeoisie's challenge. Against these anti-party, anti-socialist rightists in the academic community, we must pursue them relentlessly. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize back the historical field occupied by the bourgeoisie, and make history truly serve the politics of the proletariat.

The June 3, 1966, editorial of the People's Daily, "Seize the Historical Field Occupied by the Bourgeoisie," pointed out: "The representatives of the bourgeoisie use history as an important stronghold for their anti-party, anti-socialist activities." The "Historical Research" magazine, edited by the deputy director of the Institute of Modern History, Li Zhaozhou, is an important stronghold for the anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary activities of the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the historical field.

I

Chairman Mao has repeatedly warned us: Never forget class struggle. Unveiling the dark secrets of "Historical Research" is truly shocking.

How did Li Zhaozhou take over the editing of "Historical Research"? Those who know the details are aware that Li Zhaozhou was not originally engaged in historical studies. Around 1961, the anti-party leader of the literary and artistic world, Zhou Yang, extended his counter-revolutionary black hand to various fields of the cultural front, actively creating public opinion for the bourgeoisie's counter-revolutionary restoration activities. In his anti-party conspiracy plan, it included controlling the "Historical Research" stronghold. Therefore, after a secret plot, Li Zhaozhou, the loyal henchman of the underworld, carried out Zhou Yang's orders, fully armed, and took office.

Li Zhaozhou, as soon as he took office, immediately took a stance to attack proletarian historiography.

He first directed his spearhead at the historical revolution since 1958. He shouted: "The current trend in the academic world is 'leftist,' and it should be countered." He also said: "'Leftist' does not give up, and the rightist does not dare to speak, this is the logic." He organized people to collect the correct viewpoints proposed during the historical revolution, classify and compile them, and widely distribute them as targets for attack.

Li Zhaozhou made opposing the proletarian historical revolution the central task of "Historical Research." For this purpose, he put forward two reactionary slogans.

One slogan is to oppose "formulaism" and advocate a "rigorous academic style." He slandered Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as "formulas," while praising the bourgeoisie's pedantic historical evidence as a "rigorous academic style." This is to oppose the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide historical research, to oppose historical science serving proletarian politics, and to attempt to replace proletarian historical science with bourgeois reactionary historiography.

Another slogan is to advocate the theory of "establishing before criticizing" and to encourage "boldly raising questions." The purpose is to force Marxist historians to give up the criticism of bourgeois historiography, to encourage bourgeois rightists to "debate," to summon the ghosts and snakes to come out and launch a ferocious attack on the party and socialism.

These two slogans are actually the reactionary program of "Historical Research."

To implement this reactionary program, Li Zhaozhou also implemented a line of organizing by recruiting traitors and forming cliques. Soon after Li Zhaozhou took office, he planted his own people in the editorial department of "Historical Research" and cultivated his henchmen. Under Li Zhaozhou's control, this editorial department was obedient to Zhou Yang and his anti-party clique. Li Zhaozhou formed a close alliance with the representatives of the anti-party, anti-socialist elements in the historical community, such as Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Hou Wailu, and Liu Dayou, frequently holding banquets and secret meetings, mutually praising each other, singing in unison, and jointly plotting to restore capitalism. "Historical Research" has always advocated the reactionary historical viewpoints of Deng Tuo, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, and the like. Li Zhaozhou and his master Zhou Yang are equally hostile to workers, peasants, and soldiers, but they treat bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and ghosts and snakes as treasures, getting along very well. He let a large number of anti-communist old hands and remnants of the old society spread poison in "Historical Research," forming a counter-revolutionary chorus.

Relying on this counter-revolutionary team, Li Zhaozhou implemented bourgeois dictatorship in "Historical Research," allowing only the bourgeois rightists to attack the party and not allowing the proletarian leftists to counterattack. For example, the rightist element Shen Yuan was praised as a "genius" by Li Zhaozhou and his ilk, and his articles were repeatedly published. Shen Yuan's "Research on the 'Quick Writing'" openly stood on the reactionary position of the landlord class, enthusiastically promoting feudal ideas and feudal culture. When a comrade wrote an article criticizing it, Li Zhaozhou went to great lengths to obstruct and criticize, forcibly suppressing the manuscript. Comrade Chen Boda wrote "Critique of Li Xucheng's Autobiography," holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism, exposing the true face of the traitor Li Xucheng, and dealing a heavy blow to all traitors who betray the interests of the revolutionary people. At that time, although Li Zhaozhou was forced to publish this article, he immediately accepted Zhou Yang's instructions, colluded with Liu Dayou, and gathered the reactionary historical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to hold a secret meeting, attacking Comrade Chen Boda.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Li Zhaozhou desperately resisted and protected the "Three Family Village." He deeply hated and despised the articles that exposed the crucial issues of the counter-revolutionary elements Wu Han and others, viewing them as thorns in his eyes, slandering the leftist articles as "not reasonable," "completely scolding." Li Zhaozhou also insulted workers, peasants, and other revolutionary comrades as "people who want to make a name for themselves in twenty-four hours." When their counter-revolutionary faces were increasingly exposed, they still wanted to struggle desperately, using every means to pull the criticism to the right, turning it into an "academic discussion" to protect Wu Han from passing the test. Their counter-revolutionary stance and hatred are so clear!

Li Zhaozhou once boasted: "We must publish a school journal," "Historical Research must have a tendency." What kind of "school" journal does Li Zhaozhou want to publish? What kind of tendency does he want? The above facts can explain that he wants to implement bourgeois dictatorship in the historical field. And "Historical Research" is a living specimen of this bourgeois dictatorship!

II

Chairman Mao said: Those who want to overthrow a regime must first create public opinion and first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. The "Historical Research" edited by Li Zhaozhou is precisely a tool for the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party to prepare public opinion for overthrowing socialism and restoring capitalism.

They wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, crazily opposing Mao Zedong Thought. They oppose the policy of historical research serving proletarian politics, blowing cold winds and shooting dark arrows at the party and socialism, making shameless slanders, and attempting to bewitch people's hearts to achieve their counter-revolutionary goal of "changing the sky."

In the first issue of 1961, the first issue edited by Li Zhaozhou, an article by the anti-party element Deng Tuo was published in the first position. This article was provided by Li Zhaozhou, revised by Deng Tuo, and published under Deng Tuo's name. This is a classic example of waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. The title of the article is "Mao Zedong Thought Opens the Road for the Development of Chinese Historical Science," but the content is completely slandering and resisting Mao Zedong Thought.

Deng Tuo viciously slandered the guidance of historical research with Mao Zedong Thought as "formulaism." Deng Tuo shouted: "Formulaism is a serious obstacle to the development of historical science." He said that "about formulaism, we need to emphasize it. We must thoroughly defeat formulaism and thoroughly eliminate superstition."

On the one hand, he opposed the guidance of Marxist theory, slandering Mao Zedong Thought as a "formula" and "superstition"; on the other hand, he talked about the "importance" of historical materials, repeatedly emphasizing the need to "master all historical materials," to "master rich first-hand materials," and that "teachers should guide students to seriously study historical materials and boldly raise questions." He wanted to guide historical research to serve bourgeois politics and attempted to guide young historians into the bourgeois "historical materialism," that is, pedantic textual research, to make young people bury themselves in the pile of old papers, detach from reality, and cultivate successors for their capitalist restoration.

Chairman Mao has always emphasized the need to break down and build up, to criticize first and then establish. Deng Tuo, however, openly distorted Chairman Mao's instructions in this article, saying that "we must establish and criticize in theory, establish first and then criticize." He used the pretext of "establishing" to incite the bourgeois historical "authorities" to oppose the party's leadership. Therefore, in the latter part of the article, he even proposed: "In addition to the six political standards, the historical community can also have its own standards." He also maliciously said that "we should advocate a frank and realistic style of seeking truth from facts." He was so brazenly inciting the bourgeois rightists to rebel against the proletariat.

III

Chairman Mao said: "In Chinese feudal society, only the class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and the peasant wars were the true driving force of historical development." Historical materialism holds that human history is the history of the laboring people; while historical idealism holds that human history is the history of emperors, generals, and officials. These are two absolutely opposed historical views.

The bourgeois rightists entrenched in the historical community firmly hold the extremely reactionary position of the landlord bourgeoisie, denying that the people are the creators of world history, and striving to slander the laboring people and peasant wars. The "Discussion on Several Issues in the History of Chinese Peasant Wars" by Cai Meiping, written under the guidance of Li Zhaozhou (published in the fourth issue of 1961), and "On the Problem of Royalism in Chinese Peasant Wars" by Sun Zhaomin (published in the fifth issue of 1961), are representative works in this regard.

They vigorously distorted the needs of the landlord class to defame the oppressed and exploited peasant class. They said: Peasants endure and live in hiding, pursuing and yearning for wealth, making themselves landlords, or through various means becoming officials, obtaining fame and fortune, and bringing glory to their ancestors. They echoed the reactionary clichés of Jian Bozan, saying that peasants only oppose individual landlords but not the landlord class, only hope to establish a "good dynasty" but not oppose the feudal system, only hope to live under a "good emperor" but not oppose royalism.

These are the most despicable slanders against revolutionary peasants. Here, the sharp confrontation between peasants and landlords, this pair of hostile classes, has disappeared, and the peasants' struggle to the death against the landlord class has become a struggle for survival or for official positions.

These bourgeois rightists, who have pasted the label of "Marxist historians" on their foreheads, on the one hand, viciously curse the laboring people, and on the other hand, worship the political representatives of the feudal landlord class, the emperors, generals, and officials. In their writings, those landlord officials who have always cruelly exploited and massacred the laboring people, especially their leader, the feudal emperor, are described as great benevolent humanitarians. Look, the emperor lets the people "rest and recuperate," implements a "concession policy" for the people, can "reverse" the trend of social production decline, making the social economy "present a prosperous scene," and cultural and academic achievements continuously reach "peaks," cultivating a large number of "clean officials" and "good officials," "wise men emerging, numerous and brilliant." In short, in their eyes, the behavior of emperors and generals "conforms to the process of historical development," and is therefore worthy of affirmation and must be praised. The third issue of 1961 of "Historical Research" published an article by Liu Dayou, the deputy director of the Institute of Modern History, the standing editor of "Historical Research," and the counter-revolutionary revisionist, titled "On Kangxi," which is a typical example of using the past to satirize the present and praising feudal emperors. In this article, Liu Dayou praised Kangxi, the head of the feudal landlord class, to the skies, saying he was a "wise and brave" "sage emperor." He attributed the achievements of the people's labor and creation, especially the social and economic development achievements promoted by the peasant uprisings at the end of the Ming Dynasty, to Kangxi, saying that: due to Kangxi's rule, "China formed a vast territory, a multi-ethnic, relatively strong and unified feudal state; under this condition, the feudal economy and culture developed to a new peak." Here, Liu Dayou trampled on historical materialism to the extreme.

It should be pointed out: such fallacies that slander peasant uprisings and beautify emperors and generals flooded the "Historical Research" of 1961 and 1962, which was not accidental. This was not only a reaction to the historical revolution of 1958 but also had a direct connection with the activities of capitalism and feudalism attempting to restore at that time. They slandered the hardworking and brave laboring peasants as landlords, who only wanted to get rich and become officials, which was an attack on the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, saying that the Three Red Banners were against the nature and wishes of the peasants. If the original wish of the peasants was to become landlords, then the collective economic system and the socialist road would not be things that the peasants welcomed? Wouldn't it be only by doing "individual farming" and "three self-one management" that the peasants' requirements could be met? They continuously praised the literary and martial achievements of emperors and generals, dressing up these historical corpses as benevolent and kind sages, which was only to make people kneel to the idols of the exploiting class in their minds, and thus to prepare ideologically for the counter-revolutionary activities of the reactionary class.

IV

The bourgeois rightists in the historical community have long been waving the black flag of "historicism," opposing Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. "Historicism" has become their panacea for defending all reactionary systems, reactionary classes, and reactionary ideas. They brandish this tattered weapon everywhere, challenging proletarian historiography. Against their challenge, revolutionary historians have been fighting them resolutely.

In September 1962, Chairman Mao issued a great call to the whole party and the nation: "Never forget class struggle." Some comrades in the historical community published articles refuting the reactionary fallacies of Wu Han, Jian Bozan, and others on so-called "historicism." Seeing this situation, Li Zhaozhou was furious, quickly organizing rightists to write articles according to his outline to counterattack. The two articles on "historicism" published in prominent positions in the fourth issue of 1963 and the third issue of 1964 of "Historical Research" were produced in this way. These two articles highly praised the bourgeois rightists' "historicism" and were representative works of Li Zhaozhou and others' crazy opposition to Mao Zedong Thought.

Li Zhaozhou and his ilk put on a show of being "dialectical masters," lecturing us: In many historical works, there is too much class viewpoint, but "there is no dialectics," that is, there is no "historicism." They separated dialectics from materialism and opposed historicism to the class viewpoint. They said: "The class viewpoint is the core of historical materialism, and historicism is the dialectical understanding of the historical process," and there is no "necessary" connection between the two.

Their articles were tens of thousands of words long, seemingly very frightening. In fact, once the disguise is pierced, it is just a bunch of worthless nonsense.

Chairman Mao said: "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization. To interpret history from this point of view is called historical materialism, and to stand on the opposite side of this point of view is historical idealism." It can be seen that there is no historicism that is separated from the class viewpoint. To study history from the class struggle viewpoint of the proletariat is historical materialism. To separate the class viewpoint and historicism into two opposing things that have no necessary connection is to deliberately create confusion, using so-called "historicism" to oppose the class viewpoint of the proletariat.

Li Zhaozhou and others attempted to use "historicism" to protect various reactionary fallacies of the bourgeoisie, to protect the old historiography of the landlord bourgeoisie from criticism. This is absolutely impossible. The proletariat must smash the old world to pieces, smash it to smithereens, and on this basis, establish a brand-new world of the proletariat. The fundamental point of Marxism is to criticize, to struggle, to revolutionize, and to definitely overthrow and eliminate the things of the bourgeoisie and revisionism.

Now, the dark secrets of "Historical Research" have been exposed by the revolutionary proletariat. However, we still need to thoroughly expose and criticize the large amount of poison it has spread, so as to clean up the garbage, cleanse the filth, and plant the brilliant red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the historical field.

    《历史研究》是资产阶级史学的反动堡垒
    晋群新
    编者按
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，史学界已经揭发出一小撮反党反社会主义的右派分子和反动学术“权威”。今天本报揭露的《历史研究》杂志，就是被他们长期霸占的一个反动堡垒。自从反革命分子周扬指派他的爪牙黎澍充当这家杂志的主编以来，他们就利用“历史研究”作掩护，极力维护和散布剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯。流毒甚广，害人不浅。
    他们挖空心思要把人们拉向后转，要人们崇拜古人，崇拜帝王将相，“发思古之幽情”。他们把封建地主阶级和资产阶级的反动的历史唯心主义，精心伪装为“马克思主义的史学理论”，妄图用那些腐朽发霉的思想，来腐蚀群众，征服人心，以达到他们反革命复辟的目的。他们还借古人之口，恶毒地攻击我们的新社会。他们采用指桑骂槐、借古讽今的手法，肆无忌惮地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。
    无产阶级必须迎头痛击资产阶级的挑战。对于史学界这些反党反社会主义的右派分子，必须穷追猛斗。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，夺回被资产阶级霸占的史学阵地，使历史学真正为无产阶级的政治服务。
    今年六月三日《人民日报》社论《夺取资产阶级霸占的史学阵地》指出：“资产阶级代表人物，把史学当作他们反党反社会主义的一个重要阵地。”由近代史研究所副所长黎澍主编的《历史研究》，就是史学界资产阶级代表人物进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命活动的一个重要堡垒。
    一
    毛主席谆谆告诫我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。揭开《历史研究》的黑幕，真是令人触目惊心。
    黎澍是怎么接编《历史研究》的？了解底细的人都知道，黎澍原来并不是专搞历史的。一九六一年前后，文艺界的反党头子周扬，把他的反革命黑手伸向文化战线各个领域，积极为资产阶级的反革命复辟活动制造舆论。在他的反党阴谋计划中，就包括着控制《历史研究》这个阵地。因此，经过一番秘密策划，黎澍这个阎王殿的忠实打手，便带着周扬的旨命，披挂整齐，走马上任了。
    黎澍下车伊始，便摆开了向无产阶级历史学进攻的架势。
    他首先把矛头指向一九五八年以来的史学革命。他叫嚷：“当前学术界的倾向是‘左’，应该反一下。”又说：“‘左’的不放弃，右的不敢争鸣，这就是逻辑。”他组织人收集了史学革命中提出的正确论点，分类编纂，广为散发，作为攻击的靶子。
    黎澍把反对无产阶级史学革命作为《历史研究》的中心任务。为此，他提出了两个反动的口号。
    一个口号是反对“公式主义”，鼓吹“严谨的学风”。他将马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想污蔑为“公式”，而把资产阶级的烦琐的史料考据，吹嘘为“严谨的学风”。这就是反对用毛泽东思想指导历史研究，反对历史科学为无产阶级政治服务，妄图以资产阶级的反动史学代替无产阶级的历史科学。
    另一个口号是宣扬“先立后破”论，鼓吹“大胆提出问题”。其目的就是要迫使马克思主义史学工作者放弃对资产阶级史学的批判，鼓励资产阶级右派分子出来“争鸣”，呼唤牛鬼蛇神破门而出，向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻。
    这两个口号实际上就是《历史研究》的反动纲领。
    为了贯彻这个反动的纲领，黎澍还实行了一条招降纳叛，结党营私的组织路线。黎澍上任不久，就在《历史研究》编辑部中安插私党，培植爪牙。在黎澍的把持下，这个编辑部对周扬这一伙反党分子唯命是从。黎澍同史学界的反党反社会主义的代表人物，如邓拓、吴晗、翦伯赞、侯外庐、刘大年之流结成死党，过从甚密，或搞聚餐，或开黑会，互相吹捧，此唱彼和，共同策划复辟资本主义的勾当。《历史研究》一贯宣扬邓拓、吴晗、翦伯赞之流的反动史学论点。黎澍和他的主子周扬一样，十分仇视工农兵，而对资产阶级反动学术“权威”、牛鬼蛇神却视若珍宝，打得火热。他让大批反共老手、遗老孽少，在《历史研究》上大肆放毒，形成了一支反革命的合唱队。
    黎澍依靠这支反革命队伍，在《历史研究》上实行资产阶级专政，只准资产阶级右派向党进攻，不准无产阶级左派进行反击。例如，右派分子沈元，被黎澍之流当作“天才”加以吹捧，一再发表他的文章。沈元的《〈急就篇〉研究》，公然站在地主阶级的反动立场上，狂热宣扬封建思想和封建文化。有同志写文章批判它时，黎澍竟多方刁难，横加指责，硬把稿子扣压起来。戚本禹同志写了《评李秀成自述》，高举革命的批判的旗帜，揭露了李秀成的叛徒真面目，给一切背叛革命人民利益的叛徒以沉重打击。当时黎澍虽然被迫发表了这篇文章，却立即接受周扬的指示，伙同刘大年，纠集资产阶级反动史学“权威”开黑会，围攻戚本禹同志。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，黎澍拚命抵制，包庇掩护“三家村”。他对揭露吴晗等反革命分子要害问题的文章深恶痛绝，视为眼中钉，污蔑左派的文章不讲道理，“完全是申斥”。黎澍还辱骂工农兵和其他革命同志是“想在二十四小时内一鸣惊人的人”。当他们这一伙的反革命面貌日益暴露的时候，他们还想作垂死挣扎，千方百计地要把批判拉向右转，搞成一场“学术讨论”，以掩护吴晗过关。他们的反革命的立场和爱憎是多么分明啊！
    黎澍曾扬言：“要办学派刊物”，“《历史研究》要有倾向性”。黎澍要办的是哪个“学派”的刊物呢？他所要的“倾向性”是什么样的倾向性呢？上述事实可以说明，他就是要在史学界实行资产阶级专政。而《历史研究》正是这种资产阶级专政的活标本！
    二
    毛主席说：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。黎澍主编的《历史研究》，正是史学界那些钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物为推翻社会主义、复辟资本主义作舆论准备的工具。
    他们打着“红旗”反红旗，疯狂反对毛泽东思想。他们反对历史研究为无产阶级政治服务的方针，向党向社会主义煽阴风，放暗箭，进行无耻的污蔑，妄想蛊惑人心，以达到他们“变天”的反革命目的。
    一九六一年第一期《历史研究》，即黎澍接手主编的第一期上，以第一篇位置刊登了反党分子邓拓的一篇文章。这篇文章是由黎澍提供底稿，经邓拓加工修改后，用邓拓的名字发表的。这是一篇打着“红旗”反红旗的标本，文章的题目是《毛泽东思想开辟了中国历史科学发展的道路》，内容却完全是污蔑和抵制毛泽东思想。
    邓拓恶毒地把用毛泽东思想指导历史研究污蔑成为“公式主义”。邓拓大嚷大叫：“公式主义是历史科学发展的严重障碍”。说什么“关于公式主义，还需要着重讲一讲。我们要彻底打垮公式主义，需要彻底破除迷信”。
    一方面，他反对马克思主义理论的指导，把毛泽东思想污蔑为“公式”、“迷信”；另一方面，大谈其史料的“重要性”，反复强调“要掌握全部史料”，“要掌握丰富的第一手材料”，要“教师应该引导学生，认真钻研史料，大胆提出问题”。他要将历史研究引导到为资产阶级政治服务，并妄图将青年史学工作者引导到资产阶级的“史料学”即烦琐考据中去，要青年埋到故纸堆中，脱离现实，为他们实现资本主义复辟培养接班人。
    毛主席一直强调大破大立，先破后立。邓拓却在这篇文章中公然篡改毛主席的指示，说什么“我们必须在理论上大立大破，先立后破”。他就在“先立”的幌子下，鼓动资产阶级史学“权威”起来反对党的领导。所以他在文章的最后部分竟提出来：“除了政治上的六条标准以外，历史学界还可以有自己的标准”。他还别有用心地说什么“要提倡言必由衷的实事求是的作风”。他就是这样明目张胆地鼓动资产阶级右派分子来造无产阶级的反。
    三
    毛主席说：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”历史唯物主义认为，人类的历史是劳动人民的历史；而历史唯心主义则认为，人类的历史是帝王将相的历史。这是两种绝对对立的历史观。
    盘踞在史学界的资产阶级右派，坚持极端反动的地主资产阶级立场，否认人民是创造世界历史的动力，尽力污蔑劳动人民和农民战争。《历史研究》所发表的蔡美彪在黎澍指导下写成的《对中国农民战争史讨论中几个问题的商榷》（载一九六一年第四期），和孙祚民《关于中国农民战争中皇权主义的问题》（载一九六一年第五期），是这方面的两篇代表作。
    他们极力按照地主阶级的需要，来丑化被压迫被剥削的农民阶级。他们说：农民平时隐忍苟活，所追求和向往的就是发家致富，使自己也成为地主，或者通过各种途径成为大小官员，取得功名利禄，耀祖光宗。他们同翦伯赞的反革命滥调一样，说农民只反对个别地主而不反对地主阶级，只希望建立“好王朝”而不反对封建制度，只企望在“好皇帝”脚下生活，而不反对皇权主义。
    这些，都是对革命农民的最卑鄙的污蔑。在这里，农民和地主这两个敌对阶级的尖锐对立不见了，农民反抗地主阶级的你死我活的斗争，竟变成了只求活命或者争官逐禄的斗争了。
    这些在自己额头上硬贴上“马克思主义历史学家”标签的资产阶级右派，一方面恶毒地咒骂劳动人民，另一方面对封建地主阶级的政治代表帝王将相却顶礼膜拜。在他们的笔下，那些一贯残酷剥削、屠杀劳动人民的地主官吏，特别是他们的总头子封建皇帝，竟被描写为大慈大悲的人道主义者。你看，皇帝叫人民“休养生息”，对人民实行“让步政策”，能“扭转”社会生产凋萎的“趋势”，使社会经济“呈现繁荣的景象”，学术文化不断出现“高峰”，培养出大批“清官”“好官”，“明哲辈出，济济洋洋”。总之，在他们看来，帝王将相的行为“符合历史发展的进程”，因而是值得肯定和必须歌颂的。一九六一年第三期《历史研究》上，发表了近代史研究所副所长、《历史研究》常务编委、反革命修正主义分子刘大年所写的《论康熙》一文，是借古讽今歌颂封建皇帝的一个典型。刘大年在这篇文章里，把康熙这个封建地主阶级的头子捧上了天，说他是“天资英武，雄才大略”的“明君圣主”。他把人民群众劳动创造的成果，特别是明末农民起义所推动的社会经济发展的成绩，都上在康熙的账上，说什么：由于康熙的统治，“中国形成了一个疆域辽阔，民族众多，相当坚强统一的封建国家；封建的经济文化在这个条件下，发展到了一个新的顶点。”在这里，刘大年把历史唯物主义糟踏到无以复加的程度。
    应该指出：这种种污蔑农民起义、美化帝王将相的谬论泛滥于一九六一年和一九六二年的《历史研究》上，决不是偶然的。这不仅是对一九五八年史学革命的一种反动，而且和当时社会上资本主义、封建主义企图复辟的活动有直接联系。他们把勤劳勇敢的劳动农民污蔑为像地主一样，一心只想发家致富，作官当老爷，就是攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，就是把三面红旗说成是违背农民的本性和愿望的。如果农民的本来愿望只是想当地主，那末集体经济制度、社会主义道路，不就是农民所不欢迎的东西了吗？岂不是只有搞“单干”、搞“三自一包”才符合农民的要求吗？他们一味宣扬帝王将相的文治武功，把这些历史僵尸打扮成仁慈厚道的圣贤，也不过是要人们在精神上向剥削阶级的偶像屈膝，从而为反动阶级的复辟活动作思想准备罢了。
    四
    史学界的资产阶级右派，长期地打着“历史主义”的黑旗，对抗马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。“历史主义”简直成了他们替一切反动制度、反动阶级、反动思想作辩护的万应膏。他们到处挥舞这个破烂武器，向无产阶级历史学挑战。对于他们的这种挑战，革命的史学工作者一直同他们进行着坚决的斗争。
    一九六二年九月，毛主席向全党全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，史学界有些同志就发表文章，对吴晗、翦伯赞等人的所谓“历史主义”的反动谬论进行驳斥。黎澍见此情形，暴跳如雷，急忙组织右派娄罗，按照他的提纲，写文章进行反扑。《历史研究》一九六三年第四期和一九六四年第三期，以显著地位发表的两篇论“历史主义”的文章，就是这样出笼的。这两篇文章大捧资产阶级右派的“历史主义”，是黎澍等人疯狂反对毛泽东思想的代表作。
    黎澍之流摆出一副“辩证法老手”的架势，教训我们说：在许多历史著作中，阶级观点多了，但是“没有辩证法”，就是说没有“历史主义”。他们把辩证法和唯物主义分割开来，把历史主义和阶级观点对立起来。他们说：“阶级观点是唯物主义历史观的核心，历史主义是辩证法对历史过程的理解”，二者之间没有“必然”的联系。
    他们的文章洋洋数万言，看样子很吓人。其实，戳穿伪装，原不过是一派不值分文的胡说。
    毛主席说：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。拿这个观点解释历史的就叫做历史的唯物主义，站在这个观点的反面的是历史的唯心主义。”由此可见，根本不存在脱离了阶级观点的历史主义。用无产阶级的阶级斗争观点研究历史，就是历史唯物主义。把阶级观点和历史主义分割成为两个没有必然联系的对立的东西，就是故意制造混乱，利用所谓的“历史主义”来反对无产阶级的阶级观点。
    黎澍等人企图用“历史主义”给各种资产阶级的反动谬论作护法，保护地主资产阶级的旧史学不受批判。这是绝对办不到的。无产阶级就是要把旧世界打它个落花流水，砸它个稀巴烂，在这个基础上，创立无产阶级的崭新世界。马克思主义的基本点就是要批判、要斗争、要革命，对于资产阶级的东西、修正主义的东西，马克思主义就一定要把它打倒，把它消灭。
    现在，《历史研究》的黑幕已经被无产阶级革命派揭开了。但是，我们还需要对它所散布的大量毒素彻底揭露，彻底批判，以便扫除垃圾，涤荡污秽，在史学阵地上插上无产阶级的光彩夺目的毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
