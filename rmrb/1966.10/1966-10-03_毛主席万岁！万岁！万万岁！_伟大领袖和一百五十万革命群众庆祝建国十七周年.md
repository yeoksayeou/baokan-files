On October 1st, a red sun rose from the east.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, accompanied by his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other central leaders, ascended the Tiananmen Gate in the solemn melody of "The East Is Red" and the cheers of 1.5 million revolutionary masses. He was radiant and full of vigor, taking strong strides.

In the sky above Tiananmen Square, five giant red balloons bore the golden characters "Long Live Chairman Mao," shining brightly towards the vast blue sky.

In the center of Tiananmen Square, ten thousand revolutionary masses held up colorful flower balls, forming the characters "Long Live Chairman Mao," expressing the boundless love of 700 million people for the great leader Chairman Mao!

The marching columns of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres from the capital and all parts of the country, each waving a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," formed a vast red sea.

In this surging sea, waves of earth-shaking cheers rolled: "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live! Long Live! Ten Thousand Long Lives!"

The hearts of a billion people are with Chairman Mao

The workers, peasants, and soldiers standing on both sides of the Tiananmen Gate, seeing Chairman Mao, cheered wildly with joy.

In this surging wave, there was a young female worker, her face flushed with excitement, shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao!" over and over. She was Sun Weizhen, a model worker from the Lock Factory in Yantai, Shandong Province, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. She told people: "The day before I left, all the workers in the factory told me to shout 'Long Live Chairman Mao' 403 times when I see Chairman Mao in Beijing, to convey the wishes of all 403 workers in the factory to Chairman Mao."

Thousands and thousands of revolutionary masses who came to Tiananmen Square were sent off by many people, who repeatedly instructed: "When you get to Beijing, see Chairman Mao, and be sure to convey our greetings to him."

Zhang Buwen, the Party secretary of the Zhaoyuan Brigade, brought dried beans from the old poor peasant Gao Tongyou who had eaten with Chairman Mao, green beans from the former women's director Han Guirong, chili peppers from the former administrative director Li Xingfa, and the daily and nightly longing of the people of Zhaoyuan for Chairman Mao. He also brought two pounds of small millet himself. He said: In the past, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we used small millet and rifles to defeat Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, we continue to use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, carry forward the revolutionary tradition, and will definitely crush all enemies.

Chairman Mao came. Zhang Buwen looked and looked, tears streaming down his face. He remembered that one Lunar New Year's Eve, Chairman Mao received the lion dance troupe, and he clearly saw Chairman Mao that time. Time flies so fast, twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye. He saw Chairman Mao glowing with health, and muttered to himself: "Let's take this good news back to Zhaoyuan and tell the villagers. This is what everyone has been looking forward to the most."

The masses love Chairman Mao the most, and Chairman Mao loves the masses the most. Chairman Mao repeatedly waved and greeted the masses who were cheering and jumping on the city wall, the reviewing stand, and the square.

Liu Yingjun's mother, Zhu Xiulan, also came to the Tiananmen Gate. She saw Chairman Mao waving to her side and shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao!" even louder. Half a month ago, when she received the notice to come to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration, Liu's mother was so happy that she couldn't sleep. Yingjun was brought up by Chairman Mao, and Liu's mother had boundless love for Chairman Mao. She learned to write, first learning the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao." On her way to Beijing, hundreds and thousands of people asked her for her autograph, and she wrote not her own name but "Long Live Chairman Mao." Today, Liu's mother stood with Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen Gate for over an hour. This was the happiest moment of her life.

The representative of the national minorities speaking on the Tiananmen Gate was Basa, a liberated female serf and deputy county magistrate of Lang County, Tibet. When she walked to the microphone, she said, "We, the representatives of the national minorities, have come from the distant border to our beloved capital, Beijing, to the side of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao," and she couldn't help but burst into tears, unable to continue.

Chairman Mao turned to look at Basa affectionately, letting her calm down. Basa said in a voice from the heart: "Chairman Mao! You are the great savior of all ethnic laboring people! You are the red sun in our hearts!"

After Basa finished speaking, she walked up to shake hands with Chairman Mao. On her way to Beijing, Basa had already decided to say three things to Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, you led us to liberation!" "Chairman Mao, we will always follow you!" "Chairman Mao, may you live forever!" At this moment, she held Chairman Mao's hand, a warm current surging through her body, and she was so excited that she forgot all three sentences.

The three sentences Basa wanted to say were what a million liberated serfs in Tibet wanted to say, and what 700 million people across the country wanted to say.

Mao Zedong Thought is Victory

Today, the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, holding red banners and wearing silver aluminum helmets, stood proudly on the reviewing stand. Political instructor Wang Amo, holding a red flag with both hands, shouted enthusiastically to Chairman Mao. The red flag, with the characters "Long Live Chairman Mao" composed of Chairman Mao's commemorative badges, shone with golden light under the morning sun.

The hero of the 32111 drilling team, Wang Youfa, spoke on behalf of the workers across the country. He walked to the front of Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao warmly shook his hand that had extinguished the fire. Wang Youfa's heart was warm, and he didn't know where to start with a thousand words.

Chairman Mao lightly patted his arm, pointing to the microphone, letting him speak slowly.

Wang Youfa, with passionate language, expressed the deep affection and firm resolve of the working class across the country to follow Chairman Mao and march forward forever.

After finishing his speech, Wang Youfa shook Chairman Mao's hand tightly and said with full enthusiasm: "Wish you good health, long live forever."

Chairman Mao asked him with concern: "Are you injured?"

He replied: "No. I wrapped myself in a wet quilt and used my body to extinguish the fire at the wellhead."

Chairman Mao praised: "Very good."

This was a praise for all the heroes of the 32111 drilling team who fought the fire. This heroic collective was nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. Their famous saying, "Print Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions," is inspiring more and more people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

The old poor peasant Gu Atang from Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. On the Tiananmen Gate, she presented a pumpkin carved with "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Study hard, progress every day" to Chairman Mao, along with three letters from the commune members greeting Chairman Mao. The words on the pumpkin were carved by her young son while the pumpkin was still growing. She also showed Chairman Mao the outline of her speech on the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works, composed of dozens of drawings.

Chairman Mao smiled and said: "Good! Good!" and took a photo with her.

Gu Atang happily told everyone: "In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were treated like weeds. Chairman Mao treats us poor and lower-middle peasants like treasures. Even an old woman like me, in the past, could only stand at the door, watch the stove, read Chairman Mao's books, and now I stand at the door, watch the whole country, and have the world in my heart." She expressed her determination to use the hand that shook Chairman Mao's to hold Chairman Mao's works and study hard.

On the Tiananmen Gate, Chairman Mao took a group photo with the exemplary model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our country—the representatives of the People's Liberation Army. At this time, the model soldier Wang Yuchang, several dozen times shouted: "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

It was the great Mao Zedong Thought that made him stand out in a critical situation, saving the lives of his comrades five times; it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that made him fight bravely against pain, wear an artificial leg, and stand up again, continuing to take firm steps to serve the people. Wang Yuchang said excitedly: "I will follow Chairman Mao to revolution for life and be the most loyal soldier of Chairman Mao forever."

In front of Tiananmen, the marching columns flowed endlessly, and Lin Biao, who stood shoulder to shoulder with Chairman Mao, held up a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waving and greeting the revolutionary masses.

The great Mao Zedong Thought shines across the country and spreads around the world. A new upsurge and new situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works by hundreds of millions of people are rising.

Marching Forward with Chairman Mao in the Stormy Waves

In the marching columns, the students of universities and colleges in the capital and the Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, formed a giant flood several dozen miles long, surging through Tiananmen to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are the great commander of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and you are our highest commander of the Red Guards.

Revolutionary students carried the large gold characters "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao" through Tiananmen Square. They expressed their determination to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and to use Chairman Mao's works as a weapon to carry out the Cultural Revolution.

Nie Mengmin, a student from Peking University, spoke on behalf of revolutionary students across the country to Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow you, raise high the great banner of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, charge forward bravely, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and make the counter-revolutionary revisionists, the right-wing elements of the bourgeoisie, and the reactionary authorities of the bourgeoisie never rise again; we will definitely sweep away all the mud and dirt left over from the old world and create a new world of Mao Zedong Thought that is red all over.

After Nie Mengmin finished speaking, Chairman Mao shook hands with him. He said firmly: "Chairman Mao, please rest assured, we will definitely follow you to the end of the revolution!"

Peng Yun, the son of revolutionary martyr Jiang Zhujin, also came to the Tiananmen Gate. More than a month ago, influenced by the Red Guards in Beijing, his school, Harbin Institute of Technology, also established the Red Guards. Chairman Mao's "Sixteen Points" were published, and the news of Chairman Mao inspecting the Red Guards came. Chairman Mao's enthusiastic support for the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses inspired him, and the spirit of revolutionary martyrs who insisted on the truth at the cost of their lives inspired him. Today, he saw Chairman Mao and said excitedly: "With the great commander Chairman Mao leading us, we dare to climb the knife mountain and dare to plunge into the fire sea, and no one can stop us from marching forward to victory!"

Old Red Army soldier Li Yuheng on the reviewing stand saw the red revolutionary tide surging forward. He recalled that since he became a Red Army soldier, in the past thirty-plus years, he had followed Chairman Mao, traversed mountains and rivers, and marched 25,000 miles. Then, under Chairman Mao's leadership, he fought north and south. He clearly saw that in the course of the revolution, every step forward was the result of Chairman Mao's correct leadership and the glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making revolutionary young people grow and be tempered. The old Red Army could not help but say: Our young generation is red, imperialism and modern revisionism dream that our young generation will change color, this is completely a pipe dream!

The Red Sun in the Hearts of the Revolutionary People of the World

Many foreign friends, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought, brought revolutionary friendship from the people of various countries, flew over mountains and seas, crossed oceans, and traveled thousands of miles to Beijing, to the side of the great leader Mao Zedong. On this glorious day, they shared the joy of the festival with the Chinese people and shouted together: "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long Live the Great Leader of the Revolutionary People of the World, Chairman Mao!"

On the Tiananmen Gate, Comrade E. F. Hill, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), stood shoulder to shoulder with Chairman Mao to inspect the marching columns. He also asked Chairman Mao to sign his English copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Comrade N. Samugathasan, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, and other foreign friends also took out "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and asked Chairman Mao to sign and leave a souvenir.

Xie Shijiao, a female combat hero from the front line of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam, warmly shook hands with Chairman Mao and said excitedly: "Wish Chairman Mao good health and longevity!" She couldn't help but shout: "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao affectionately said to her: "Wish you victory, wish Chairman Ho Chi Minh good health!"

Xie Shijiao also said to Comrade Lin Biao standing by Chairman Mao: "Wish Comrade Lin Biao good health, wish the People's Liberation Army great victories!"

Comrade Lin Biao also shook hands with her warmly and said: "Wish you victory, please convey my greetings to Chairman Ho Chi Minh!"

On the foreign guests' reviewing stand, many foreign friends held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and, in various languages, read together with the Red Guards and revolutionary students on the reviewing stand. Several members of the Japanese Women's Congress delegation to China asked the Chinese escort to teach them to sing "The East Is Red." They learned and sang over and over again. When a giant statue of Chairman Mao appeared in the marching columns, a group of Ecuadorian young students immediately cheered, shouting in Chinese with rhythm: "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Long Lives!"

Many foreign friends enthusiastically praised the great world significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao and the fearless revolutionary rebel spirit of the Red Guards. A comrade from the New Zealand Communist Party delegation said: "China's Cultural Revolution is a great event in the world proletarian revolution. The Chinese Red Guards have left us a very deep impression. They are full of vigor and enthusiasm, actively study Chairman Mao's works, which has greatly inspired us." Mr. Seishu Shimizu, director of the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, said: "As a cultural organization, we have learned a lot from China's Cultural Revolution and plan to return to Japan to promote it to the broad masses of the Japanese people, to learn from the Chinese Red Guards, and to learn their revolutionary spirit."

When Chairman Mao walked to both sides of the Tiananmen Gate to wave and greet everyone, the foreign guests immediately burst into a chorus of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Many foreign friends were so excited that they shed tears of joy. They kept shouting, shouting for the brightest red sun to rise from their hearts, shouting for the brightest red sun to illuminate the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world.

Chairman Mao and the Masses Are Heart to Heart

Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and is most willing to be with the masses. On this great day, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao spent more than six hours with 1.5 million revolutionary masses.

After the marching columns passed through the square, more than ten thousand revolutionary masses gathered in the south of the square, cheering and surging towards Tiananmen. At this time, Chairman Mao warmly applauded them. The square was filled with cheers, and Tiananmen was in a state of excitement. Comrade Zhou Enlai waved a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," directing everyone to sing together: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun..."

The song echoed through Beijing and resounded across the vast sky.

The great leader repeatedly waved and greeted the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses cheered and held up their copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" higher and higher, wishing they could fly to the Tiananmen Gate.

The great leader understands the hearts of the masses the best. Chairman Mao walked down the hundred steps of the Tiananmen Gate with steady steps, crossed the Golden Water Bridge with a spirited demeanor, and came to the crowd, warmly greeting the revolutionary masses on the festival. Everyone shouted in unison: "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live! Ten Thousand Long Lives! Wish Chairman Mao eternal youth!"

The entire Tiananmen Square was in a state of excitement, and the joyous atmosphere reached a new peak.

At night, Tiananmen Square was brightly lit, with a sea of people. Our great commander Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, sat on the Golden Water Bridge, with a hundred thousand revolutionary masses, watching the colorful fireworks and celebrating the National Day night.

It was deep into the night, and the revolutionary masses gathered at Tiananmen Square were reluctant to leave. They sang and danced, cheered and jumped, and talked excitedly:

"Today, the greatest leader of our time, Chairman Mao, received us, this is our happiest day!"

"Chairman Mao is so healthy, this is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people, and also the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people all over the world!"

"Chairman Mao cares for us so much, supports us so much, we must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and build our great motherland even stronger and more prosperous!"

    毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    ——伟大领袖和一百五十万革命群众庆祝建国十七周年
    十月一日，一轮红日从东方升起。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在他亲密的战友林彪同志和中央其他领导同志陪同下，在庄严的《东方红》乐声中，在一百五十万革命群众的欢呼声中，容光焕发，神采奕奕，迈着雄健的步伐，登上天安门城楼。
    天安门广场上空，五个巨大的红色气球上，“毛主席万岁”的金色大字，向万里晴空放出灿烂的光采。
    天安门广场中心，十万革命群众手持彩色花球，组成“毛主席万岁”五个大字，表达了七亿人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱！
    首都和来自全国各地的工农兵、革命师生和革命干部的游行大军，个个挥动着鲜红鲜红的《毛主席语录》本，汇成一片红色的海洋。
    在这沸腾的海洋上，翻滚着地动山摇的欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    亿万人民心向毛主席
    站在天安门城楼两侧的工农兵观礼代表，看到毛主席来了，欣喜欲狂地欢呼起来。
    在这滚滚的声浪中，有一个青年女工，兴奋得满脸通红，一声一声地欢呼“毛主席万岁”。她是山东省烟台市造锁厂的五好女工孙维珍，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。她对人说：“我临来的那天早上，全厂工人要我到北京见到毛主席时，一定喊四百零三声毛主席万岁，把全厂四百零三个工人的心意带给毛主席。”
    千千万万来到天安门广场的革命群众启程来京时，有多少人送了一程又一程，有多少人一声又一声地嘱咐：“到了北京，见到毛主席，千万要替我们向他老人家问好。”
    延安枣园大队的党支部书记张步文，捎来了当年和毛主席一起吃过饭的老贫农高同有送的豇豆，捎来了当年的妇女主任韩桂英送的绿豆，捎来了当年的行政主任李兴发送的辣椒，捎来了枣园人民日日夜夜想念毛主席的心情。他自己还给毛主席带来了二斤小米。他说：过去我们在毛主席领导下，用小米加步枪，打败了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派。今天，我们继续以毛泽东思想为武器，发扬革命传统，一定能粉碎一切敌人。
    毛主席来了。张步文看啊，看啊，热泪不住地流下来。他记得，有一年正月十五，毛主席接见秧歌队，那次他特别清楚地看见了毛主席。时间多快呵，转眼二十年了。他看到毛主席红光满面，健康极了，自言自语地说：“就把这喜事带回枣园，告诉乡亲们吧！这是大家最盼望的。”
    群众最热爱毛主席，毛主席最热爱群众。毛主席不断地向城楼上、观礼台上和广场上欢呼跳跃的群众招手致意。
    刘英俊的妈妈朱秀兰，也来到天安门城楼上。她看见毛主席向自己这边招手，把“毛主席万岁”的声音喊得更高了。半个月前，接到来北京参加国庆观礼的通知，刘妈妈高兴得睡不着觉。英俊是毛主席教导出来的，刘妈妈对毛主席无限热爱。她学写字，先学“毛主席万岁”这五个字。来北京的一路上，成百上千的人找她签名，她写的不是自己的名字，是“毛主席万岁”。今天，刘妈妈同毛主席一起，在天安门城楼上度过了一个多小时。这是她一生中最幸福的时刻。
    代表少数民族在天安门城楼上讲话的，是西藏的翻身女农奴、朗县副县长巴桑。当她走到扩音器前，刚说到“我们少数民族代表团从遥远的边疆，来到了我们日夜想念的祖国的首都——北京，来到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的身边”，就禁不住热泪盈眶，再也说不下去了。
    毛主席侧过身来，亲切地望着巴桑，让她平静下来。巴桑用发自肺腑的声音说：“毛主席呀！您是我们各族劳动人民的大救星！您是我们心中的红太阳！”
    巴桑讲完话，走上去握住毛主席的手。在来北京的路上，巴桑早就打算好，要向毛主席说三句话：“毛主席，您领导我们翻身解放了！”“毛主席，我们永远跟着您走！”“毛主席，祝您万寿无疆！”此刻，她握着毛主席的手，一股暖流传遍全身，激动得把这三句话全忘了。
    巴桑要说的这三句话，是西藏百万翻身农奴都想说的话，也是全国七亿人民都想说的话。
    毛泽东思想就是胜利
    今天，32111钻井队的英雄们，高举红色锦旗，头戴银色铝盔，英姿勃勃地站在观礼台上。政治指导员王阿毛，双手托着一面红旗，向着毛主席尽情欢呼。红旗上用毛主席像纪念章组成的“毛主席万岁”五个字，在朝阳下闪着金光。
    英雄的32111钻井队的王有发，代表全国工人讲话。他走到毛主席的面前，毛主席热烈地握住他扑灭烈火的手。王有发心里热乎乎的，千言万语不知从那里说起。
    毛主席轻轻拍拍他的臂膀，指着扩音器，让他慢慢地讲。
    王有发用充满激情的语言，表达了我国工人阶级无限热爱毛主席的深情厚意，表达了永远跟着毛主席阔步前进的坚定决心。
    讲完话以后，王有发又紧紧地握住毛主席的手，满腔热情地说：“祝您老人家身体健康，万寿无疆。”
    毛主席关切地问他：“你负伤了没有？”
    他回答说：“没有。我围着湿棉被用身体把井口的大火压住。”
    毛主席赞扬说：“很好。”
    这是对32111钻井队所有血战火海的英雄们的赞扬。这个英雄的集体，是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的。他们“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上”的名言，正在激励着越来越多的人努力活学活用毛主席著作。
    江苏省太仓县老贫农顾阿桃，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。她在天安门城楼上，把一个刻着“毛主席万岁”“好好学习，天天向上”的北瓜，和公社社员们问候毛主席的三封信，送给了毛主席。北瓜上的字，是瓜正在生长时，她的小儿子刻上去的。她还把几十幅画组成的学习毛主席著作经验的讲话提纲，拿给毛主席看。
    毛主席微笑着说：“好！好！”并且和她一起照了像。
    顾阿桃高兴得逢人就说：“旧社会把我们贫下中农当成一棵草，毛主席把我们贫下中农当成一个宝。像我这样的老太婆，过去只能站在家门口，眼看灶前头，读了毛主席的书，我也站在家门口，眼看全中国，心怀全世界了。”她表示一定要用同毛主席握过的手，捧着毛主席著作，好好学习。
    在天安门城楼上，毛主席同我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的光辉榜样——中国人民解放军的观礼代表合影留念。这时，爱兵模范、空军某部管理员王裕昌，几十遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    是伟大的毛泽东思想，使他在危急的情况下，挺身而出，五次保护了战友的生命安全；是伟大的毛泽东思想，使他同伤痛作了顽强的斗争，装上一只假腿，重新站了起来，继续迈出了为人民服务的坚定步伐。王裕昌激动地说：“我要跟随毛主席干一辈子革命，永远做毛主席最忠诚的战士。”
    天安门前，游行队伍滚滚流动，和毛主席并肩站立的林彪同志，举着红色的《毛主席语录》，向革命群众招手致意。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，普照全国，传遍全世界。亿万人民活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮、新局面，正在兴起。
    跟着毛主席在大风浪中前进
    在游行队伍中，首都大中学校以及来自祖国五湖四海的红卫兵和革命师生，手挽手，肩并肩，汇成几十里长的巨大洪流，浩浩荡荡地通过天安门，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大统帅，您是我们红卫兵的最高司令。
    革命学生抬着“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的大金字，走过天安门广场。他们表示，一定要响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向一个新的阶段，以毛主席著作为武器，搞好文化大革命。
    北京大学学生聂孟民，代表全国革命学生向毛主席宣誓：毛主席啊！我们一定跟着您，高举无产阶级革命造反的大旗，冲锋陷阵，勇往直前，把反革命修正主义分子，把资产阶级右派分子，把资产阶级反动权威，彻底打倒，打垮，使他们永世不得翻身；我们一定要荡涤一切旧世界遗留下来的污泥浊水，创造出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界。
    聂孟民讲完话，毛主席和他握了手。他坚定地说：“毛主席，请您老人家放心，我们一定跟着您革命到底！”
    革命烈士江竹筠同志的儿子彭云，也来到天安门城楼上。一个多月前，在北京红卫兵的影响下，他所在的学校哈尔滨工程学院也建立了红卫兵。毛主席主持制定的十六条公布了，毛主席检阅红卫兵的消息传来了。毛主席对革命群众首创精神的热情支持鼓舞着他，革命先烈不惜生命坚持真理的精神激励着他。今天，他见到了毛主席，激动地说：“有伟大统帅毛主席领导，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，谁也不能阻挡我们胜利前进！”
    老红军战士李玉恒在观礼台上，看到红色的革命洪流滚滚向前。他回想从他当红军战士之日起，三十多年来，曾跟随着毛主席，踏过万水千山，长征二万五千里，随后又在毛主席的领导下转战南北。他清楚地看到在革命的历程中，每前进一步都是毛主席正确领导的结果，都是毛泽东思想的光辉胜利。如今，毛主席亲自发动和领导这场无产阶级文化大革命，使革命青少年，得到锻炼成长。老红军情不自禁地说：我们的年青的一代是鲜红的，帝国主义和现代修正主义幻想我们年青一代会变颜色，这完全是白日作梦！
    世界革命人民心中的红太阳
    许许多多外国朋友，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和对毛泽东思想的无限信仰，带着世界各国人民的革命友情，飞越千山万水，渡过大海大洋，不远万里，来到北京，来到伟大领袖毛泽东身边。在这个光辉的节日里，同中国人民一起，共享节日的欢乐，同声欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    在天安门城楼上，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席爱·弗·希尔同志，和毛主席并肩检阅了游行队伍。他还请毛主席在他的英文本《毛主席语录》上签了名。
    锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记纳·桑穆加塔桑同志等外国朋友，也拿出《毛主席语录》，请毛主席签名留念。
    来自反美斗争最前线的越南南方女战斗英雄谢氏娇，热情地握住毛主席的手，激动地说：“祝毛主席健康长寿！”又情不自禁地喊道：“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席亲切地对她说：“祝你们胜利，祝胡志明主席长寿！”
    谢氏娇又对站在毛主席身旁的林彪同志说：“祝林彪同志身体健康，祝中国人民解放军取得巨大胜利！”
    林彪同志也同她亲切地握手，并且对她说：“祝你们胜利，请向胡志明主席问好！”
    在外宾观礼台上，许许多多外国朋友手持《毛主席语录》，用各种不同的语言，同观礼台上的红卫兵和革命师生一起热情地朗读。日本妇女会议访华代表团的几位团员，请我国陪同人员教她们唱《东方红》。她们一遍又一遍地学，一遍又一遍地唱。当游行队伍中出现了巨大的毛主席塑像的时候，一批厄瓜多尔的青年学生顿时欢腾起来，他们用中文有节奏地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    许多外国朋友热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发起和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大世界意义，热烈赞扬红卫兵勇敢无畏的革命造反精神。新西兰共产党代表团的同志说：“中国的文化大革命是世界无产阶级革命中的伟大事件。中国的红卫兵给我们留下了极其深刻的印象。他们有朝气，有热情，积极学习毛主席著作，这使我们受到极大的鼓舞。”日本松山芭蕾舞团团长清水正夫说：“作为一个文化团体，我们从中国文化大革命学到了很多的东西，准备回国后向广大日本人民进行宣传，向中国红卫兵学习，学习他们的革命精神。”
    当毛主席走到天安门城楼两侧向大家挥手致意的时候，外宾们立刻响起了一片“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。许多外国朋友都激动得流出了热泪。他们不停地欢呼，欢呼一轮最红最红的太阳从他们的心中升起，欢呼一轮最红最红的太阳照亮了全世界革命人民的心。
    毛主席和群众心连心
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最愿意和群众在一起。在伟大的节日里，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，同一百五十万革命群众欢聚了六个多小时。
    游行队伍全部通过广场以后，聚集在广场南部的十多万革命群众欢呼着涌向天安门。这时候，毛主席向他们热烈地鼓起掌来。广场上欢声雷动，天安门上下一片欢腾。周恩来同志挥着红色的《毛主席语录》，指挥起人们齐声高歌：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。……”
    歌声震荡着北京城，歌声响彻万里长空。
    伟大领袖一再向革命群众招手致意。革命群众欢呼着把手中的《毛主席语录》举得高了又高，恨不得插翅飞上天安门城楼。
    伟大的领袖最了解群众的心。毛主席步履从容地走下天安门城楼的一百层台阶，精神抖擞地跨过金水桥，来到群众队伍中，亲切地向革命群众致节日的祝贺。人们齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    整个天安门广场在沸腾，欢乐的气氛达到新的顶峰。
    入夜，天安门广场灯火辉煌，人山人海。我们的伟大统帅毛主席，穿着军装，来到金水桥上席地而坐，同百万革命群众一起，观看五彩缤纷的焰火，欢度了国庆之夜。
    夜深了，聚集在天安门广场上的革命群众，还恋恋不舍地不愿离去。他们载歌载舞，欢呼跳跃，纵情交谈：
    “今天，当代最伟大的领袖毛主席接见了我们，这是我们最最幸福的日子！”
    “毛主席身体这么健康，这是我们中国人民的最大幸福，也是全世界革命人民的最大幸福！”
    “毛主席这样关心我们，这样支持我们，我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把我们伟大的祖国建设得更加强盛，更加兴旺！”
