	Tokyo, October 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition team held a grand banquet on the evening of October 21 in Kitakyushu City to celebrate the great success of the People's Republic of China Economic and Trade Exhibition, which was supported by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

	More than 2,000 Japanese people from various circles were invited to attend the banquet.

	During the banquet, Japanese friends and members of the Chinese exhibition team frequently toasted to the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and to the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	Xiao Xiangqian, the head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition team, spoke first. He said that the success of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition proves that Sino-Japanese friendship has formed a historical tide, and all attempts to obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship will fail. This is a victory for the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, it is a powerful support from the Japanese people for the Chinese people who are vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

	Xiao Xiangqian said: This victory powerfully refutes the enemy's so-called "China is isolated" nonsense. It proves that, as Chairman Mao said, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends.

	He said that during this exhibition, a small group of people who claimed to be friendly and cooperative but secretly engaged in sabotage and division were thoroughly exposed and rejected by the broad masses of the Japanese people.

	Xiao Xiangqian also pointed out that through this exhibition, the mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Japan has been further enhanced, and the friendship between the two peoples has been strengthened, making a valuable contribution to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. It has also played an active role in promoting trade, especially friendly trade between Kyushu, western Japan, and China.

	Kitakyushu City Mayor Yoshida Hoshiaki spoke at the banquet, saying that China's exhibition in Kitakyushu is a support for the Japanese people. More than 1.5 million people in Kitakyushu and western Japan visited the Chinese exhibition, which shows the friendly feelings of the Japanese people towards China.

	Kawase Ikkan, chairman of the All-Japan Cooperation Committee for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, said he believed that as long as the three principles of trade and the three principles of politics, as well as the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics, are adhered to, trade between Japan and China will definitely develop rapidly. Hiroshi Kawagi, vice-chairman of the Fukuoka Prefecture Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association, condemned in his speech the actions of a small group of elements that sought to split the Japan-China friendship movement. He expressed his determination to learn from Chairman Mao's great work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," to rely closely on the masses, and to widely carry out the Japan-China friendship movement.

	The banquet also read congratulatory messages from Shibata Jiro, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association and a member of the Diet of the Socialist Party, and Seikenji Koi, a Japanese peace activist in Beijing.

	More than 200 Japanese youths from Yamaguchi Prefecture stayed after the banquet ended and gathered with the entire Chinese exhibition team in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the venue. Holding hands, they sang songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao and Japanese revolutionary songs, and repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" The youths from Yamaguchi Prefecture also expressed their determination to resolutely oppose Soviet modern revisionism and its various old and new followers in Japan, and to fight together with Chinese youths to defend Marxism-Leninism and develop the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

    中日友好的历史洪流不可阻挡
    中国经济展览团举行酒会庆祝中国展览会胜利闭幕
    新华社二十二日讯  东京消息：中国经济贸易展览团团长萧向前二十一日晚上在北九州市举行盛大酒会，庆祝中华人民共和国经济贸易展览会在广大日本人民支持下取得巨大的胜利。
    日本各界人士二千多人应邀出席了酒会。
    席间，日本朋友同中国展览团工作人员，频频为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的健康和日中两国人民的战斗友谊干杯。
    展览团团长萧向前首先讲话，他说，中国经济贸易展览会获得巨大成功，证明了中日友好已经形成了一个历史的巨流，一切企图阻挠中日友好的牛鬼蛇神都将归于失败。这是中日友好事业的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。同时，这是日本人民对于在毛主席领导下轰轰烈烈地进行着无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民的有力支持。
    萧向前说：这个胜利有力地粉碎了敌人的所谓“中国孤立了”的谰言，它证明了毛主席所说的广大日本人民都是我们真正的朋友。
    他说，在这次展览会期间，有一小撮口称友好、伪装合作而在背后搞分裂破坏的人，被彻底地揭发出来，被广大日本群众抛在一边。
    萧向前还指出，通过这次展览会，进一步增进了中日两国人民的相互理解，加强了中日两国人民之间的友谊，对中日友好事业作出了可贵的贡献。同时也对中日贸易特别是对九州、西日本地区同中国的友好贸易，起了积极的促进作用。
    北九州市市长吉田法晴在酒会上致词说，中国在北九州举行展览会，这是对日本人民的支持。北九州和西日本地区人民一百五十多万人参观中国展览会，这表现了日本人民对中国的友好感情。
    中国经济贸易展览会日本全国协力会会长川濑一贯说，我相信只要坚持贸易三原则和政治三原则以及政治经济不可分的方针，日本和中国的贸易一定能够得到迅速发展。日中友好协会福冈县联合会副会长柏木正一在讲话中谴责了一小撮破坏日中友好的分子企图分裂日中友好运动的行为。他表示要学习毛主席的伟大著作《为人民服务》，紧密地依靠群众，广泛开展日中友好运动。
    酒会上，还宣读了日中友好协会会长、社会党国会议员松本治一郎和在北京的日本和平人士西园寺公一的贺电。
    来自山口县的日本青年二百多人在酒会结束后继续留下来，和中国展览团全体人员欢聚在会场内悬挂着的毛主席巨幅照片前，手挽着手，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲和日本革命歌曲，并不断高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中日两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”山口县青年还表示：坚决反对苏联现代修正主义及其在日本的形形色色的新旧追随者，坚决同中国青年一道为保卫马克思列宁主义和发展日中人民的战斗友谊而共同斗争。
