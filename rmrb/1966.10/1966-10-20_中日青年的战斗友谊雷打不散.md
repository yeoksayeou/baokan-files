This summer, our delegation from the All-China Youth Federation visited Japan. When the visit concluded, we made a promise with our Japanese friends: See you in Beijing! However, due to the unreasonable refusal by the Sato government to issue passports, Japanese youth have yet to be able to come to China to participate in the second session of the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. We express our utmost indignation towards the Japanese reactionaries' collusion with U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their various followers in disrupting Sino-Japanese friendship.

Currently, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Soviet revisionism, along with their various followers, are conspiring to intensify their "joint actions," striving to obstruct and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship, forming a counter-revolutionary, anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people's reverse current.

However, as Chairman Mao said in 1945: "The current world trend is that democracy is the mainstream, and anti-democratic reactionaries are merely a reverse current. Currently, the reactionary reverse current attempts to suppress the mainstream of national independence and people's democracy, but the reactionary reverse current will never become the mainstream." This is an unshakable truth.

Who is a friend of the Japanese people and who is an enemy, the broad masses of the Japanese people see it clearly. On the day we arrived in Osaka, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk also arrived there. At that time, some Japanese youth held flowers and banners to welcome us; another group of youth, with deep hatred, shouted angrily at Rusk, "Go back!" At the welcoming banquet held for us that day, Japanese youth passionately declared: "When we protested Rusk's arrival at the airport, we had a fierce struggle with the police. We will fight to the end for Sino-Japanese friendship." To resist imperialism, one must unite with China; this is the common belief of the Japanese people and the people of the world revolution. Our Japanese friends often tell us: In Japan, whoever lowers the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship will be isolated; whoever aligns with U.S. imperialism will be ruined. The friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples has become a historical trend that no force can stop.

Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." Japanese revolutionary youth love Chairman Mao and take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide to battle. A Japanese friend said: "The Chinese people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Allow me to use Mao Zedong Thought to explain this issue: From the surface, our strength is still small, but from the essence, only the revolutionary strength of the Japanese people is truly powerful. The struggle is arduous, but one day we will surely win!" Hearing these words, I felt deeply moved and very excited! Great Mao Zedong Thought makes us united like an iron wall, enduring like the Great Wall and Mount Fuji!

Japanese youth are continuing their unyielding struggle to participate in the friendship festival. I admire their fighting spirit and firmly support their heroic struggle. The combat friendship between revolutionary youth of China and Japan is unshakable, and victory will surely be ours!

    中日青年的战斗友谊雷打不散
    今年夏天，我们中华全国青年联合会代表团访问了日本。访问结束时，和日本朋友相约：北京再见！但是，由于佐藤政府无理拒发护照，使日本青年至今不能前来中国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢。我们对日本反动派勾结美帝、苏修及其追随者破坏中日友好的这一罪行，表示无比的愤慨。
    目前，美日反动派和苏修及其形形色色的追随者，加紧勾结，大搞“联合行动”，极力阻挠和破坏中日友好，形成一股反共反华反人民的逆流。
    但是，正如毛主席在一九四五年所说的：“现在的世界潮流，民主是主流，反民主的反动只是一股逆流。目前反动的逆流企图压倒民族独立和人民民主的主流，但反动的逆流终究不会变为主流。”这是一条颠扑不破的真理。
    谁是日本人民的朋友，谁是日本人民的敌人，广大的日本人民是看得清清楚楚的。在我们到达大阪的那天，美国国务卿腊斯克也到了那里。这时，一部分日本青年捧着鲜花，打着欢迎的旗帜来迎接我们；另一部分青年则怀着无比的仇恨，向腊斯克愤怒高呼：“滚回去！”在当天为我们举行的欢迎晚会上，日本青年慷慨激昂地说：“我们在机场抗议腊斯克来日本时，同警察进行了一场搏斗。我们要为日中友好战斗到底。”反帝必须联华，这是日本人民和世界革命人民的共同信念。日本朋友经常告诉我们：在日本，谁要放下中日友好的旗帜，谁就要遭到孤立；谁要投靠美帝，谁就要遭到破产。中日人民的友谊已经成为历史的潮流，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”日本革命青年热爱毛主席，把毛主席的话当成战斗的指南。一个日本朋友说：“中国人民是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，请允许我也用毛泽东思想说明这样一个问题，就是从表面看来，我们的力量还小，但从本质来看，只有日本人民的革命力量才是真正强大的。斗争是艰苦的，但是终有一天我们要胜利！”听了这些话，我感到无限亲切，十分兴奋！伟大的毛泽东思想使我们团结得像铜墙铁壁一样牢不可破，像长城和富士山一样长存！
    日本青年正在为争取参加友好大联欢，继续进行着不屈不挠的斗争。我敬佩他们的战斗精神，最坚决地支持他们的英勇斗争。中日两国革命青年的战斗友谊是风刮不倒、雷打不散的，胜利一定属于我们！
