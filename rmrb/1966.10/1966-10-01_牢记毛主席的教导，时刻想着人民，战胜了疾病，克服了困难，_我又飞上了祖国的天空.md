I was originally the leader of a flight squadron. Due to a serious stomach illness, I stopped flying in 1963. After recovering from my illness, the organization assigned me to work in the management department. While diligently performing my duties, I also persisted in exercising to create conditions for resuming flight. After a period of training, I applied to the organization to resume flying.

Some comrades said, "Your stomach, which has undergone surgery, can it allow you to fly?" "Someone with a body like yours flying a fighter jet, not only is it unprecedented in Chinese history, but it might also be the first time in the history of world aviation." Hearing these comments, I did not waver. I thought: Didn't Chairman Mao say, "We are doing something extremely glorious and great that our predecessors have never done"? We are soldiers educated by Chairman Mao; we must dare to tread paths that our predecessors have not walked and do things that our predecessors have not done.

After a physical examination, my application was approved. On the day the notice came down, I was so happy that I couldn't sleep all night.

Returning to the flight squadron, I thought: "I haven't flown for three years and five months. All the data are unfamiliar. If I don't prepare well, it won't just cause problems; it will also increase the number of flights, wasting resources for the country. I must find ways to ensure safety, reduce the number of flights, and quickly restore my skills." Following the party branch's requirements, I prioritized learning what I needed to fly; I got up earlier and went to bed later, using my spare time to prepare thoroughly. During the cockpit practice, the weather was very hot, and I was sweating all over as soon as I entered the cockpit. So what if I sweat a lot! If I prepare well, I can complete the fewest takeoffs and landings for solo flight, saving some fuel and materials for the people, and I can also start combat duty a day earlier. Thinking of these things, I didn't feel the heat anymore. After the examination, I was approved to participate in the flight. On the first flying day, after the mission was assigned, I was a bit nervous at the beginning. However, I thought of Chairman Mao's instructions: "Resolve to overcome a thousand hardships and ten thousand obstacles, and strive for victory." My mind quickly calmed down. I decided to fly boldly. After two days of flight checks in the air, I completed seven takeoffs and landings and was approved for solo flight. After flying for more than nine hours, I was approved to participate in combat duty. Many comrades congratulated me. Some comrades asked, "You stopped flying for such a long time, why can you resume flying so quickly?" I said, "The experience is simple: Remembering Chairman Mao's instructions, always thinking of the people."

    牢记毛主席的教导，时刻想着人民，战胜了疾病，克服了困难，
    我又飞上了祖国的天空
    空军某部飞行员　夏小欢
    我原来担任飞行中队长，因为得了严重的胃病，一九六三年停止了飞行。病好了以后，组织上分配我到管理科工作。我一面努力搞好本职工作，一面坚持锻炼身体，为恢复飞行创造条件。经过一段时间的锻炼，我就向组织上申请恢复飞行。
    有的同志说：“你那个动过手术的胃还能允许你飞吗？”“像你这样的身体飞歼击机，不光中国历史上没有，就是在世界空军史上也可能是第一回。”听了这些反映，我没有动摇。我想：毛主席不是说过“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”吗？我们是毛主席教育出来的战士，就是要敢于走前人没有走过的路，做前人没有做过的事。
    经过检查身体，我的报告被批准了。通知下来的那一天，我高兴得一夜没有睡着。
    回到了飞行大队，我想：“三年零五个月没有飞了，各种数据都生疏了。准备不好，不光会出问题，还会增加飞行次数，给国家造成浪费。要想尽办法保证安全，减少次数，尽快恢复技术。”我按照党支部的要求，急用先学，飞什么学什么；早起一会，晚睡一会，利用业余时间抓紧准备。座舱实习时，天气很热，一进座舱浑身是汗。多流汗怕什么！准备好，用最少起落放单飞，就可以给人民节约一些油料、器材，也可以早一天担任战斗值班。想到这些，也就不感到热了。经过检查，批准我参加飞行了。第一个飞行日下达任务后，开始我有一点紧张。但是，我想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”思想很快就镇静下来。我决心大胆地飞。经过两个飞行日空域带飞检查，七个起落就放了单飞。飞了九个多小时，就批准我参加了战斗值班。不少同志向我祝贺。有的同志问：“你停飞这么长时间，为什么这样快就能恢复飞行？”我说：“体会只有一条：牢记毛主席的教导，时刻想着人民”。
