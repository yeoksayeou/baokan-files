At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward in our country, we are gathered here to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and we feel greatly excited and happy. On behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government, I extend warm congratulations to the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students and teachers, revolutionary Red Guards and young people, and revolutionary cadres in our country! I extend warm congratulations to the representatives of the revolutionary people of all nationalities in our country! I extend warm congratulations to the representatives of overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao! I extend a warm welcome and thanks to our friends from the five continents!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. It is based on Chairman Mao's summary of the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship and class struggle in our country and internationally. The historical experience of proletarian dictatorship tells us that without a cultural revolution of the proletariat, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated; to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, we must promote proletarian ideology and criticize bourgeois ideology, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and firmly establish the roots of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has already demonstrated tremendous power. It has smashed the arrogance of the reactionary bourgeoisie, cleansed the filth and dirt left over from the old society, destroyed the four olds of the exploiting classes, and established the four news of the proletariat, greatly promoting the ideological transformation of the people. Now, the whole Party and the whole country are in the midst of a high tide of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. The spiritual face of 700 million people has been completely renewed.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist education movement in cities and countryside have powerfully promoted the advance of our socialist construction. Our industry has made great progress in both quantity and quality. Agriculture has had consecutive bumper harvests. The level of science and technology has been greatly raised. National defense is being continuously strengthened. This year is the first year of our country's third five-year plan. The industrial and agricultural production targets are expected to be overfulfilled. A new situation of all-around advance is emerging.

All the achievements we have made in the spiritual and material realms are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The Chinese people have such a great leader and feel infinitely happy and honored. We are firmly convinced that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and pass it on from generation to generation, we will surely be able to build our great motherland well and make it an iron fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has been warmly welcomed and praised by all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, greatly encouraging their revolutionary spirit and confidence in victory. A handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries maliciously curse us precisely because our cultural revolution has uprooted the roots of their subversive activities and peaceful evolution in our country, hitting their vital points. Their curses prove that we are right and further expose their reactionary faces of hostility towards the Chinese people and the cause of human progress.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is an unprecedented new thing. We hope that friends from various countries will take the opportunity of your stay in China to have a good look and welcome your valuable opinions to make our cultural revolution better.

Comrades and friends! The current international situation is a very favorable situation for the revolutionary people. The days of U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries will not be long. The days of modern revisionism are also getting worse. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are growing stronger. The revolutionary movements of the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are thriving. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, is continuously advancing from victory to victory. The desperate U.S. imperialists are colluding with modern revisionism, using the United Nations, and hatching new peace talks. The United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese question. The heroic Vietnamese people will not yield. All the plots of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism are doomed to failure.

The Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, are determined to make every sacrifice and pay any price to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam; to resolutely support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and to resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has extremely profound significance in ensuring that our country adheres to proletarian internationalism.

We must unite with all people in the world who oppose imperialism and colonialism to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs through to the end!

We must, together with all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists in the world, carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the people of the world forward!

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country,
To the great unity of the people of the world,
To the great development of the liberation cause of the people of all countries,
To the health of our great leader, great teacher, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao,
To the health of our friends from various countries,
To the health of all compatriots and comrades present,

Cheers!

    在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    新华社三十日讯　周恩来总理在庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年招待会上的讲话，全文如下：各位来宾，同志们，朋友们：
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命高潮的时候，我们同大家欢聚一堂庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年，感到非常兴奋和愉快。在这里，我代表毛泽东主席、中国共产党和中国政府，向我国广大工农兵、革命师生、革命的红卫兵和青少年、革命干部，表示热烈的祝贺！向我国各族革命人民的代表们，表示热烈的祝贺！向海外侨胞和港澳同胞的代表们，表示热烈的祝贺！向来自五大洲的朋友们，表示热烈的欢迎和感谢！
    我国无产阶级文化大革命是我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。这是毛主席总结了我国和国际无产阶级专政和阶级斗争的历史经验提出的。无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，不进行无产阶级文化革命，无产阶级专政就不能巩固；要巩固无产阶级专政，就必须大兴无产阶级思想，大灭资产阶级思想，彻底挖掉修正主义的思想根子，牢牢扎下马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根子。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命已经显示出无比巨大的威力。它打掉了反动资产阶级的威风，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水，破剥削阶级的四旧，立无产阶级的四新，大大促进了人的思想革命化。现在，全党全国正掀起一个大学毛泽东同志著作的高潮。七亿人民的精神面貌焕然一新。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命和城乡社会主义教育运动，有力地推动了我国社会主义建设事业的前进。我国的工业在产量和质量方面都有了很大的发展。农业连续获得了丰收。科学技术的水平有了很大的提高。国防力量正在不断加强。今年是我国第三个五年计划的第一年。工农业生产指标预计可以超额完成。一个新的全面跃进的局面正在出现。
    我国人民在精神领域和物质领域里所取得的一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。中国人民有这样伟大的领袖，感到无比幸福，无上光荣。我们深信不疑，只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把它一代一代传下去，我们一定能够把我们的伟大祖国建设好，使它成为无产阶级的铁打江山，永不变色。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命受到了全世界的一切马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的热烈欢迎和赞扬，大大地鼓舞了他们的革命斗志和胜利信心。一小撮帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派恶毒地咒骂我们，正是因为我国的文化大革命挖掉了他们在我国搞颠覆活动和和平演变的根子，打中了他们的要害。他们的咒骂，恰恰证明我们做得对，进一步暴露了他们敌视中国人民和人类进步事业的反动面目。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的新事物。我们希望各国的朋友们利用你们在中国逗留的机会，多看一看，并且欢迎你们提出宝贵的意见，使我国的文化大革命进行得更好。
    同志们，朋友们！当前的国际形势是有利于革命人民的大好形势。美帝国主义和各国反动派的寿命不会太长了。现代修正主义的日子也越来越不好过。马克思列宁主义的队伍不断壮大。世界人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命运动正在蓬勃发展。越南人民的抗美救国战争，在胡志明主席的领导下，不断从胜利走向胜利。走投无路的美帝国主义正在勾结现代修正主义，利用联合国，策动新的和谈阴谋。联合国根本无权过问越南问题。英雄的越南人民是不会屈服的。美帝国主义和现代修正主义的一切阴谋活动是注定要失败的。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民下定决心，不惜一切牺牲和代价，坚决支持越南人民打到底，把美国侵略者赶出越南；坚决支持亚非拉各国人民的反帝革命斗争；坚决支持全世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，对于保证我国坚持无产阶级国际主义，具有极为深远的意义。
    我们一定要联合世界上一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底！
    我们一定要同全世界一切革命的马克思列宁主义者一道，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，把国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向前进！
    现在，我提议：
    为我国各族人民的大团结，
    为全世界人民的大团结，
    为各国人民的解放事业的大发展，
    为我们的伟大领袖、伟大导师、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的健康，
    为各国朋友们的健康，
    为所有在座的同胞们、同志们的健康，
    干杯！
