Title: Never Overlook a "Small Issue"

In handling every matter, no matter how small a life issue, there is always the question of whether it is for the revolution or for oneself, whether it is for the public or for the private. This is the measure of whether a person is truly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Last August, on my way back from a business trip, I saw a piece of oily cloth used for wiping machines in a garbage pile by the roadside. This cloth was just a bit dirty; after washing, it could still be used to wipe guns. I originally intended to pick it up and take it back. When I walked to the garbage pile, I saw someone not far away watching me. At this moment, I felt a bit embarrassed. I didn't pick up the cloth, but this small issue started to trouble me. Picking up "rags" had always been my habit, but why was I bold enough to pick them up in the barracks and not outside the barracks? I took this "small issue" to consult Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "When faced with a matter, one first thinks of oneself and then of others... Such a person is not a Communist, at least not a pure Communist." Picking up a piece of cloth is not a shameful thing. In the old society, my ancestors generation after generation worked as laborers for the landlords, and throughout the year, they couldn't eat their fill. The leftovers and scraps thrown out by the landlords, no matter how many people there were, had to be picked up. Now, having enough to eat and wear, being afraid to pick up a piece of cloth is a change, isn't it? Not daring to pick up this piece of oily cloth seems like a small matter, but actually, it is bourgeois ideology at work. If we let these bourgeois ideas grow in our minds, without paying attention to them, they will be like weeds in a field. If you don't weed them out, the weeds will grow big and choke the crops. After a struggle in my thoughts, the correct ideas finally prevailed, and bourgeois ideology was defeated. Courage also came. I immediately turned back and picked up the piece of oily cloth from the garbage pile.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In battle, one must fight one battle at a time, and the enemy must be defeated one part at a time." The transformation of one's worldview is also achieved through solving one specific problem at a time. To change one's worldview, one must start with specific problems, neither overlooking major flaws and mistakes in one's thoughts nor overlooking "small issues" in daily life. Only in this way can one get rid of the "self" and emphasize the "public."

### 不放过一个“小问题”

    不放过一个“小问题”
    五好战士　张世占
    我们处理每一件事情，那怕是一件生活“小事”，都有一个为革命还是为个人，为“公”还是为“私”的问题。这是检验一个人是不是活学活用毛主席著作的尺码。
    去年八月，我在出差回来的路上，看见路旁垃圾堆里扔着一块擦机器用的油布。这块布只是脏一些，洗巴洗巴满可以擦枪用。我本来准备把它拣起来拿回去。当我走到垃圾堆旁，看见不远的地方有人在看着我。这时候我就有点抹不开脸。布没有拣成，但这个小问题却在脑子里打开架了。本来拣“破烂”已经是我的老习惯了，可是，为啥以前在营房里面敢拣，这次出了营房就不敢拣了呢？我带着这个“小问题”去向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算……这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”拣破布本来不是丑事。在旧社会，我家祖祖辈辈给地主当长工，一年四季吃不饱饭，地主家里扔出的剩饭残渣，不管人多人少都要拣起来。现在吃得饱饱的，穿得暖暖的，拣块破布还怕丑，这不是在变吗？不敢拣这块油布，看来是件“小事”，其实是资产阶级思想在作怪。如果让这些资产阶级思想在头脑里滋长，不管不问，就会像懒汉种地一样，满地的小草不去锄，结果小草长大，吞没庄稼。经过一番思想斗争，正确的思想终于占了上风，资产阶级思想被打垮了，勇气也就来了。我马上调头跑回去，把那块垃圾堆里的油布拣了回来。
    毛主席教导我们：“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。”一个人世界观的转变，同样是通过一个一个具体问题的解决来实现。改造世界观，就得从具体问题改造起，既不放过自己思想上比较大的缺点和错误，也不要放过日常生活中的“小问题”。这样，才能跳出“我”字，突出“公”字。
