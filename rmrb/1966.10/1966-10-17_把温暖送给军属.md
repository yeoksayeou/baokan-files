On August 29, the mothers of soldiers Xue Lide and two other soldiers came from the countryside to visit their sons in the military. In the evening, they arrived at Nanjing's Xinjiekou. These three elderly women were visiting the city for the first time, and since they did not speak the local dialect and could not read, they asked many people but still couldn't find out which bus to take to the military base.

Just as they were anxiously wandering around, a female student wearing a Red Guard armband enthusiastically approached them. After learning the situation, she comforted the elderly women not to worry and said, "It's getting late. You can stay at our house tonight, and tomorrow I will definitely help you find your sons." The three elderly women were touched by her enthusiasm and followed her, saying, "Thanks to Chairman Mao, we've met such a good student."

The three elderly women arrived at the Red Guard's home. The Red Guard's mother, who was over sixty years old, hurriedly fetched water and prepared food, treating them as if they were family. When it was time to sleep, the three members of the family gave their bed to the three elderly women and squeezed together upstairs to sleep.

After bringing the three elderly women to her home, the Red Guard went out and did not return until midnight. As soon as she entered the door, she told the three elderly women, "I found it. I found the detailed address of your sons."

The next day, before dawn, the Red Guard family hurriedly got up to prepare breakfast. After the elderly women had eaten, the Red Guard escorted them to the bus and all the way to the military base.

The military commander heard about this and rushed to the company to thank the Red Guard. She humbly said, "This is what Chairman Mao taught us to do. Compared to Comrade Lei Feng, I am still far behind. I need to learn more from the soldiers." We asked her name many times, but she did not answer. We only saw on her school badge the words "Nanjing Third Girls' Middle School."

    把温暖送给军属
    八月二十九日，战士薛利德的母亲和另外两位战士的母亲，一同从乡下到部队来看儿子。傍晚，她们来到了南京市新街口。三位老年人第一次进城，加上言语不大通，又不认识字，问了好多人，都没打听到去部队该坐那路汽车。
    正当她们焦急地在街头徘徊的时候，一位戴着红卫兵袖章的女学生热情地走了过来。她问清缘由，便安慰老人们不要着急，并且说：“天色不早了，今晚就住在我们家，明天我一定帮助你们找到儿子。”三位老人被她的热情感动了，一面跟她走，一面高兴地说：“托毛主席的福，遇到了这样的好学生。”
    三位老人到了这个红卫兵的家里。这个红卫兵年过六十的母亲赶忙又倒水，又做饭，招待得真比亲人还亲。睡觉时，一家三口将床铺让给三位老人，自己挤到楼上去睡。
    那个红卫兵把三位老人带到家里以后，就走了出去，直到半夜时分才回来。她一进门，就对三位老人说：“找到了，找到你们儿子的详细地址了。”
    第二天，天还没亮，红卫兵一家又赶忙起床做饭，让老人们吃饱以后，由这位红卫兵带她们坐上公共汽车，一直护送到部队。
    部队首长知道了这件事，赶到连队向这位红卫兵道谢。她谦虚地说：“这是毛主席教导我们做的。比比雷锋同志，我还差得远呢，我要好好地向解放军同志学习。”我们多次问她的姓名，她都没有回答，我们只在她的校徽上，发现了“南京市第三女子中学”九个字。
