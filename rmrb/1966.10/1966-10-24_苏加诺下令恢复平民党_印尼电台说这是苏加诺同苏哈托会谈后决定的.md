Jakarta Radio reported that this decision was made after a meeting between Sukarno and Suharto.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, Jakarta Radio broadcasted on the 19th that Indonesian President Sukarno issued a presidential decree, announcing the "restoration of the Indonesian Communist Party and the reinstatement of its original activities." At the same time, Sukarno also revoked his decision to dissolve the Indonesian Communist Party on September 21, 1965, and all provisions within that decision.

The radio station reported that Sukarno issued this decree after a meeting with Suharto, the leader of the right-wing military regime.

The Indonesian Communist Party is a party composed of Trotskyites and other reactionaries in Indonesia. It has been favored and supported by the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union. Sukarno issued an order on January 6, 1965, to ban the activities of the Indonesian Communist Party.

At that time, the decision to dissolve the Indonesian Communist Party was strongly supported by progressive newspapers in Indonesia. They pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party, under the banner of a "Marxist party," a "left-wing party," and a "revolutionary party," was actually implementing its right-wing agenda.

    苏加诺下令恢复平民党
    印尼电台说这是苏加诺同苏哈托会谈后决定的
    据新华社二十二日讯　雅加达消息：据雅加达电台十九日广播，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在一项总统决定书中，宣布“重新恢复平民党，并给它以恢复原先活动的权力”。同时苏加诺还宣布撤销他在一九六五年九月二十一日发出的解散平民党的决定和这个决定中的一切规定。
    电台说，苏加诺是在同右派军人政权的头目苏哈托举行会谈后发出这项决定书的。
    平民党是印度尼西亚的托洛茨基分子和其他反动分子组成的政党。它受到了苏联现代修正主义领导集团的赏识和支持。苏加诺总统在一九六五年一月六日下令禁止了平民党的活动。
    在当时，解散平民党的决定曾受到了印度尼西亚进步报纸的热烈支持。它们指出，平民党打着“马克思主义政党”、“左翼政党”和“革命政党”的旗号，来实现它自己的右派纲领。
