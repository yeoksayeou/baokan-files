The reactionary essence of Jian Bozan's "Course in Historical Philosophy"

The *Liaoning Daily* published an article by Zheng Lunyi titled "Jian Bozan is an Old Hand at Anti-Communism and Anti-People," which analyzes the reactionary essence of Jian Bozan's book "Course in Historical Philosophy." The article points out that for a long time, Jian Bozan has claimed to be a "revolutionary" and an "old Marxist historian." However, upon opening Jian Bozan's "Course in Historical Philosophy," his true colors are revealed: Jian Bozan is an old hand at anti-communism and anti-people, who has consistently sung the praises of the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek vigorously promoted reactionary policies, restricting, suppressing, and sabotaging the people's anti-Japanese forces, and vying with the Communist Party of China for the leadership of the War of Resistance. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: The big landlords and big bourgeoisie represented by Chiang Kai-shek are the right wing of the anti-Japanese national united front. The Chinese revolution can only be led by the Communist Party of China. Yet, Jian Bozan lavishly praises the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "With this great revolutionary leader, China's resistance against Japan is even more resolute and active." Jian Bozan actually beautifies the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek, who has always advocated "expel the foreigners first, stabilize the interior," as a "great revolutionary leader," the "initiator" and "organizer" of the War of Resistance; and praises the compromising Chiang Kai-shek as a "resolute" and "active" anti-Japanese faction.

At that time, Chairman Mao pointed out: Only by leading the people of the whole country to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies of compromise, division, and retrogression can we persist in the war of resistance, unity, and progress. Yet, Jian Bozan, in a state of madness, says: "Without such a great man as Chiang Kai-shek, his genius, his clear foresight, his correct leadership, his resolute consciousness, and his powerful call, it would not be easy to unite the Chinese people, regardless of class, race, party, and occupation, like iron; it would not be easy to make China's war of resistance continue under any harsh conditions."

Jian Bozan distorts history and turns black into white. He attributes the merits of the Chinese people, who were organized under the leadership of our Party to resist Japan, to the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. He says: "In the twenty months of the war of resistance, due to the correct leadership of the supreme leader, due to the active call of the Kuomintang... the Chinese people—especially the toiling peasants—are marching to the battlefield in millions, becoming anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in millions. Chinese workers, Chinese youth, Chinese women, and even a part of the Chinese propertied class are united and taking action in various anti-Japanese organizations..."

"Course in Historical Philosophy" is the proof of Jian Bozan's selling out to the Chiang family regime. Before liberation, Jian Bozan was a loyal defender of the last dynasty in China—the Chiang family regime; after liberation, he remained an active advocate for the restoration of the capitalist system.

### 翦伯赞《历史哲学教程》的反动实质

    翦伯赞《历史哲学教程》的反动实质
    《辽宁日报》发表郑伦一的文章《翦伯赞是反共反人民的老手》，剖析翦伯赞《历史哲学教程》一书的反动实质。文章指出，长期以来，翦伯赞自封为“革命者”、“老的马克思主义的历史学家”，但是，翻开翦伯赞的《历史哲学教程》，就揭了他的老底，翦伯赞是一个一贯为国民党蒋介石歌功颂德的反共反人民的老手。
    在抗日战争时期，人民公敌蒋介石极力推行反动政策，限制、打击和破坏人民的抗日力量，与中国共产党争夺抗日战争的领导权。毛主席早就指出：以蒋介石为代表的大地主大资产阶级，是抗日民族统一战线的右翼，中国革命，只能由中国共产党来领导。而翦伯赞却大肆吹捧人民公敌蒋介石，他说：“有了这一个伟大的革命领导者，中国的抗日就更为坚决，更为积极。”翦伯赞竟然把一贯实行“攘外必先安内”的反共卖国贼蒋介石，美化为“伟大的革命领导者”，抗日战争的“发起者”、“组织者”；把对日妥协的蒋介石，歌颂为“坚决”、“积极”的抗日派。
    当时，毛主席指出：只有领导全国人民对蒋介石的妥协、分裂、倒退的反动政策进行针锋相对的斗争，才能坚持抗战、团结、进步。而翦伯赞却丧心病狂地说：“没有蒋介石这样的伟大，他的天才，他的明确的预见，他的正确的领导，他的坚决的意识，他的有力的号召，就不容易使得中国的人民，不分阶级种族，党派，职业，像铁一样坚强地团结起来，就不容易使得中国的抗战，在任何艰苦的条件之下，都能坚持地继续下去。”
    翦伯赞歪曲历史，颠倒黑白，他把中国人民在我们党领导下组织起来抗日的功劳，都记在国民党、蒋介石的头上。他说：“在抗战的二十个月中，由于最高领导者之正确的领导，由于中国国民党……之积极的号召，中国的人民大众——尤其是劳苦的农民，正在百万百万地走上战场，千万千万地变成抗日游击队。中国的工人，中国的青年，中国的妇女，甚至一部分中国的有产阶级都在各种抗日的组织中团结起来，行动起来……。”
    《历史哲学教程》是翦伯赞卖身投靠蒋家王朝的证明。翦伯赞在解放前，是中国末代王朝——蒋家王朝的忠实维护者；在解放后，他仍然是复辟资本主义制度的积极鼓吹者。
