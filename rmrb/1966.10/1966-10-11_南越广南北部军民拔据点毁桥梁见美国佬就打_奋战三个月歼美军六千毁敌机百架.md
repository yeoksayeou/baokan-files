The people and soldiers in the northern part of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam have been relentlessly attacking the enemy, achieving significant victories in the third quarter of the year. They have annihilated 6,077 American aggressors and eliminated or disbanded over 1,700 puppet soldiers.

During this period, the people and soldiers in this region also destroyed or damaged 268 enemy vehicles of various types; shot down or destroyed 100 enemy aircraft; sunk five enemy warships; demolished five bridges; and burned down three enemy barracks and two million liters of fuel.

The local people, in coordination with the liberation armed forces, have continuously organized numerous political struggles. In these three months, 78,000 people participated in more than 2,000 rallies and demonstrations against American and puppet atrocities. They also assisted the liberation armed forces in dismantling the enemy's military, leading to nearly 100 puppet soldiers surrendering with their weapons.

The people's armed forces in Quang Ngai Province launched a fierce assault on the outlying strongholds of the River City Military District from September 10 to 18, destroying 11 enemy strongholds and annihilating nearly 300 enemy soldiers. The River City Military District is a crucial enemy stronghold, controlling three major roads leading to Ba Gia, Y Linh, and Ba Dinh. The enemy has established a series of outlying strongholds around it, forming a defensive line.

While destroying the enemy's outlying strongholds, the liberation armed forces also heavily bombarded the enemy within the River City Military District, causing significant casualties. Local guerrilla forces also assisted the people in demolishing many "strategic hamlets" and liberated the Son Giang Commune.

The same news agency reported that the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam decided on October 5 to award the Second-Class Liberation Medal to a unit that achieved a great victory in Ninh Thuan Province. This unit launched a fierce attack on the American military base in the Ninh Thuan area on the night of September 22, annihilating nearly 1,000 American aggressors and destroying or damaging more than 80 enemy aircraft.
