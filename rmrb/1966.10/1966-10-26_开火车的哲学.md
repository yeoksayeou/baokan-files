Editor's Note: "The Philosophy of Driving a Train" uses vivid and simple language to explain the law of the unity of opposites from many aspects. It has facts and arguments, and is a good article about the working people studying and applying Chairman Mao's philosophical works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The law of the unity of opposites, or the law of contradiction, is the fundamental law of the universe. Therefore, it is also the fundamental law of thought." The article by the 5437 Youth Train Crew proves that studying the revolutionary dialectics developed by Chairman Mao and consciously using the law of the unity of opposites to study our struggles and work, to grasp its laws, can make our understanding of objective things go from shallow to deep, from necessity to freedom. It can greatly promote the revolutionization of people's thinking and promote all our revolutionary and construction work.

This article, along with many other articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers, is a powerful refutation of the slander by some representatives of the bourgeoisie against the working people studying Chairman Mao's works. Marxist philosophy is born from the struggles of the masses and serves the revolutionary struggles of the masses. The characteristic of Marxist philosophy is its class nature and practicality. The working people, with deep class feelings, study Chairman Mao's works to summarize the experiences of revolution and construction, to transform the subjective and objective worlds, and for the revolution. In their studies, they can combine theory and practice to the greatest extent, actively learn and apply, and see immediate results. Therefore, they learn the best, use it the best, and achieve the greatest results in transforming the subjective and objective worlds.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. We do all our work relying on Mao Zedong Thought, relying on people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. To better strengthen the education of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses and cadres, to arm the broad masses and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, our revolutionary and construction work will be invincible. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, exert our utmost efforts to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, to truly grasp it, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

The Philosophy of Driving a Train

Our crew has been established for nearly six years. Under the Party's cultivation and education, we have achieved certain results and accumulated some experience. However, sometimes when we drive the train, we still feel rushed and confused. We are not sure how to ensure safety and punctuality, and we often worry about causing losses to the state if something goes wrong. Last year, when we studied Chairman Mao's instructions on continuously summarizing experience, we reflected on the situation of driving trains over the past few years. We found that although we have the desire to drive well for the revolution, we have not grasped the laws of driving well. Since then, we have established a system of summarizing experience after each trip. After more than a year of exploration and summarization, we gradually understood several relationship issues in driving, making us clearer and the locomotive more obedient.

People and the Train
People listen to the Party, the train listens to people

Driving a train is the combination of people and the train. To drive well, is the train the main factor, or is the person the main factor?

On this issue, we have some personal experiences.

In July 1960, when we started driving this train, it was either late or it consumed too much coal. Sometimes it was both late and consumed too much coal. Was it the train's fault? No. The train was a brand new one just out of the factory. Was it the coal's fault? No. The coal was also good. What was the reason then? It was the people's fault, the problem of people's thoughts. At that time, our crew of nine young people came from all over the country to the northwest. When we arrived, we saw that the sandstorms were quite severe. Some comrades were not settled. Some said, "A vast desert, endless sandstorms, the locomotive can't take it, and people can't bear it either." The Party branch, in response to this situation, organized us to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." At the beginning of the study, one person read, and everyone listened. As we listened, it was like eating sugarcane, the more we ate, the sweeter it got, the more we listened, the more intimate it felt, and the more we studied, the more enlightened we became. Some said, "We came from all over the country to here to make a revolution, not to eat ready-made meals." Some said, "Yugong had the will to move the mountains, this bit of difficulty can't stop us from driving the train?" Then we raised the slogan, "Difficulties can't scare the heroes, sandstorms can't stop the wheels from turning," and decided to overcome the difficulties. From then on, the train was still the same train, and the people were still the same people, but the people's thoughts had changed, and the enthusiasm for driving was different. The section launched the "Hundred Stations, Not One Minute Late" campaign, and our crew proposed "Thousand Stations, Not One Minute Late." At that time, although the quality of the coal was poor, we still achieved the result of "Ten Thousand Stations, Not One Minute Late," and received the reward from the Ministry of Railways.

When we summarized this period of work, everyone thought that this achievement was obtained by listening to Chairman Mao's words, so we summarized two sentences: "People listen to the Party, the train listens to people." We carved these two sentences on a wooden board and hung them in the driver's cabin as our motto.

Having tasted the sweetness of reading Chairman Mao's books, we loved reading Chairman Mao's books even more and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide our actions. No matter what problems arise or what difficulties we encounter, we firmly act as the masters of the locomotive, driving the locomotive forward; we will never be the slaves of the locomotive.

Through several years of practice, we deeply feel that in the relationship between people and the train, the train is dead and needs people to drive it. To drive well, the condition of the locomotive is indeed important, but without the subjective initiative of people, the locomotive's role cannot be fully played. The pulling force of the locomotive has a certain limit, but the wisdom and strength of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are limitless. To be the master of the locomotive, one must have skills, but if one only has skills and does not emphasize politics, one will lose direction, and skills cannot fully serve socialist construction. In the relationship between people and the train, the human factor comes first. In the relationship between politics and technology, politics comes first.

Fast and Slow
If you should be fast and are not, it is slow; if you should be slow and are not, it will be even slower

We are a youth train crew. Young people have a spirit of daring to try, and when driving, we always want to go a little faster. However, sometimes when we want to go faster, we end up going slower. Once, Qin Fuhong's shift was pulling an uphill train, and after leaving the smoke station, it encountered a strong wind. There was also an uphill slope there. In this situation, to arrive on time, we needed to increase the pulling force of the locomotive, so the steam and water became quite tight. When the train passed through the Tuodun station, if we used the condition of the small slope in the station, closed the steam valve slightly, and reduced the steam and water, although it would be a few minutes late, it could ensure that it would not be late again, and if done well, it could even catch up. However, they did not do this because they were afraid of being late and wanted to use the small slope in the station to speed up the train's speed. Who would have thought that after leaving the station, the steam and water supply became even tighter, and finally, they had to close the steam valve. They wanted to go fast but did not succeed and ended up being even later.

Sometimes, what seems slow actually ends up being faster. On the day after Qin Fuhong's shift was late, Chen Shuhua's shift drove the same train. The weather conditions were the same, but they learned from the previous day's lesson. When the train arrived at Hongliuhe station, they saw that the steam and water were quite tight, so they insisted on making the fire good and supplying enough steam before starting the train. Although they started three minutes late, they arrived at Liuyuan three minutes early.

We often encounter similar situations when driving. We realize that fast and slow are not absolute. When you should be fast, you must be fast; when you should not be fast, you must create conditions to be fast within the slow. When leaving the station and before the slope, you must be fast. If you are not fast when leaving the station, you will be late for the first half of the station, and the latter half will become more and more rushed, and mistakes are easily made in a hurry; if you are not fast before the slope, you will not be able to go fast on the slope, not only will you be late and consume more coal, but if you are not careful, you may have to stop on the way or retreat down the slope. When the steam and water are insufficient, you should not go fast even if you can. If you only seek temporary speed, you will bring more slowness; at this time, you should insist on making a good fire base, supplying enough steam and water, so although it seems slow, it contains the factor of speed, and has the foundation of speed. When entering the station and passing through densely populated areas, you must be slow. Especially when entering the station in strong winds and in the early morning and late evening when signals are not clear, when entering stations with poor signal visibility and small curve switches, and when the station is changing shifts, you must slow down and be ready to stop at any time. These places and times are the most likely to have accidents. If you want to go fast, once an accident occurs, you will only be slower.

Difficult and Easy
For difficulties, strategically despise them, tactically take them seriously; for easiness, have the spirit of treating a rabbit as a tiger

In driving, we often encounter the issues of "difficult" and "easy." Sometimes, when pulling a lot, the conditions are difficult, but it goes smoothly; sometimes, when pulling less, the conditions are good, but something goes wrong. Once, Cong Baoku's shift pulled 2,178 tons from Weidian to Liuyuan and arrived seven minutes late. Cong Baoku is a skilled operator, and the assistant driver and fireman are also very good. They had pulled trains with more tons than this one before, so why did this one, with fewer tons, end up being late? This is because they lacked mental and material preparations and encountered snow and wind, and the sand ran out, causing the delay. This incident tells us that the human factor is the decisive factor in the mutual transformation of difficulty and easiness. Because it is difficult to pull a train, it is generally easy to pay attention to it, and there is a mental and material preparation to overcome difficulties; for an easy-to-pull train, it is easy to relax and become complacent, and once difficulties are encountered, one will be taken aback. In driving, not only between pulling more and pulling less, good weather and bad weather, but also between uphill and downhill, daytime and nighttime, single locomotive and train, there are issues of difficulty and easiness, and we need to consciously do the work of transforming difficulty into easiness. Therefore, we realize that in dealing with difficult problems, we should treat them like enemies, strategically despise them, and tactically take them seriously; in dealing with easy problems, we should have the spirit of treating a rabbit as a tiger.

Big and Small Things
Big things can become small, and small things can become big

In the past, when we were driving, we paid attention to big things and thought that as long as we held onto the watermelon, dropping a few sesame seeds was nothing. Who would have thought that it was in this "nothing" that we hit a nail and suffered? For a period of time, our train's wind chest safety valve was intermittently leaking air, and everyone thought it was nothing and did not deal with it in time. One day, just as we were about to leave the depot, the safety valve went crazy, continuously releasing air. If it was not handled within a few minutes, it would delay the departure; if it was not handled within half an hour, it would cause the train to be late. Another time, the water hose of the locomotive was loose, dripping water down, and under the influence of the "nothing" mentality, it was thought that it was not a critical place and was not tightened in time. Who would have thought that when the train reached the section, the joint came off, and the water in the water tank poured out. If it was not handled urgently, the tens of tons of water would soon run out, the locomotive would stop, and the train would be stranded halfway. Although these two emergencies were handled well and did not cause any loss, we still have lingering fears.

Why did we suffer from small things? Mainly because we regarded big things and small things as unchangeable and did not understand that small things will turn into big things when they develop to a certain extent. After these two incidents, we realized that we must hold onto the watermelon and not drop the sesame seeds. We also established a system of repairing as soon as we see a problem and not leaving any problems for the next shift. In this way, we have the initiative in driving.

General and Specific
When the location changes, the conditions change, the method of handling problems should also be different

The climate of the desert is changeable, especially in spring and autumn, sometimes the temperature difference within a day is quite large. This brings many difficulties to the lubrication work of the locomotive. In the past, we did not realize the impact of the climate on lubrication and still followed the old method of lubricating in the interior. As a result, within a day, the same amount of oil was applied, but it leaked out during the day and was not enough at night. On windy days, we were always afraid that the windward side would lack oil, and we poured it in heavily, but we did not expect that the leeward side would lack oil. To make the locomotive have a good lubrication state and ensure the safety and punctuality of the train, we racked our brains. Someone said, "This weather is really hard to figure out!" This sentence gave us a great inspiration. Precisely because it is hard to figure out, we must think more about it. We found that the location had changed, the conditions had changed, but we were still following the old method of lubricating in the interior, how could we not hit a nail? Later, we explored the method of doing a good job of locomotive lubrication under special climatic conditions.

We found that although the climate of the desert is ever-changing, the three basic factors are still "cold," "heat," and "wind." We took countermeasures against these three basic factors. In winter, it is cold, and oil is easy to solidify, so we pay attention to keeping the oil passage unobstructed. In summer, the sun is scorching, so we pay attention to the lubrication work on the sunny side of the locomotive. In autumn, the temperature changes greatly, sometimes cold and sometimes hot, so we prepare for both cold and hot. For example, when it is cold, we change to a fine oil core, and when it is hot, we change to a coarse oil core, so we can maintain an appropriate amount of oil. On windy days, the oil hole is easy to clog, the oil film is easy to break, and the parts are easy to be damaged, so we installed anti-sand baffles in the main parts to deal with the impact of wind on lubrication. We also found that the windward side has a strong airflow, and the leeward side has thin air, so the incoming wind and the dust stirred up by the locomotive often rotate and blow towards the leeward side. Based on this, on windy days, we pay special attention to applying oil to the leeward side. In this way, starting from the specific situation of the desert, we apply oil with the right medicine for the right illness, and the lubrication condition of the locomotive is better.

Praise and Criticism
When praised, find faults; when criticized, be more enthusiastic

Over the past few years, we have received more praise from leaders and comrades and less criticism. In this situation, some comrades have become spoiled, and when they hear praise, they are happy, but when they hear criticism, they can't take it. Since last year, we have consciously fought against this mentality and gradually gained some new understanding of praise and criticism.

Why is there more praise than criticism? Because praise is easier to come by. As long as we have a little good performance, the leaders and comrades, in order to encourage us, will praise us; when we have faults, the leaders and comrades will consider it carefully before pointing them out to us. This way, we feel that criticism is more precious and harder to come by. After realizing this, we do not become complacent when praised and also find our shortcomings from the other side of praise; when criticized, we do not lose heart and treat it seriously and correct it resolutely.

Criticism and praise, although their forms of expression are different, their purposes are the same, both to promote our continuous progress. Moreover, we also feel that the other side of criticism has praise, and the other side of praise has criticism. For example, once Liu Junlin met a cadre who was accompanying the work on a passenger car, and he praised our crew members for their polite attitude towards the inspection personnel and providing as much warm steam as they wanted. When we studied this praise, we felt that it was both praise and criticism. Because the climate changes, we are the first to feel it on the locomotive, and we should adjust the warm steam in time. We did not do this but waited for the inspection personnel to ask for warm steam, which shows that we did not consider the passengers carefully. Since then, we have actively paid attention to the changes in the climate and adjusted the warm steam in time.

Daring and Conserving
Achievements are made by daring, conserving passively will not conserve, only daring can achieve greater achievements

Last year, when we saw that the locomotive had walked more and more kilometers safely, we were afraid of accidents and losing achievements, and began to have the idea of conserving achievements. Especially in May last year, the newspaper published our crew's deeds and listed our crew with some famous advanced collectives and individuals across the country, we thought that this time we were "blowing the trumpet through the window—fame is outside," and the idea of conserving achievements became prominent. After having the idea of conserving achievements, our daring spirit decreased. It was reflected in pulling more and faster, taking a cautious and meticulous attitude, saying on the surface that we wanted to be "stable," but in essence, we were afraid that pulling more and faster would easily cause accidents and affect achievements. Later, with the help of the Party organization, we realized that "conserving" is the theory of stopping. This made our thoughts take a step forward, and our daring spirit also increased. On the eastern line (Liuyuan to Shule River), we launched a high tide of overloading: the regulation is 2,100 tons, but we once reached 2,342 tons. In the past year, the number of technical transformation projects has also increased from 27 to 35.

Through the inspection of the idea of conserving achievements, we reviewed the road we have walked in the past and realized that achievements always come with the word "daring." The more you conserve, the less daring you have, and achievements cannot be refreshed. Achievements are like rowing against the current, if you do not advance, you will retreat. You want to conserve, but others are advancing, and you will fall behind. We, the working class, are advocates of continuous revolution, and we should dare to advance continuously and not just conserve, staying in the same place.

We also realized that the essence of daring and conserving is a matter of public and private. If there is the word "public" in one's mind, thinking that we drive for the revolution and to support the liberation cause of the three-fifths of the suffering people in the world, there will be a daring spirit, putting achievements aside, starting from zero, fearless, and advancing bravely, daring to make new achievements. If the word "private" pops up in one's mind, fearing the loss of achievements, wanting to conserve achievements, the result can only be to stop and do nothing. Conserving achievements, in a word, is only to conserve one's own fame and interests. After realizing this problem, we resolutely broke with the idea of conserving achievements and decided to always be the daring pioneers of the revolution.

Our understanding of some problems is just beginning. Even for the few problems we mentioned above, our understanding is still very shallow. In our thoughts, there are still many problems to be solved; in our work, there are still many laws to be explored and grasped in practice. We firmly believe that as long as we always emphasize politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously transform our thoughts, wholeheartedly for the people, wholeheartedly for the revolution, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hard work, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, learn from the advanced, learn from the brother crews, we will definitely understand more problems, overcome the numerous difficulties in our advance, grasp more laws of driving, obtain more freedom, turn passive into active, do our work better, and contribute greater strength to the cause of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

### 开火车的哲学

专栏：

    编者按：《开火车的哲学》，用生动、朴素的语言，从许多方面阐述了对立统一的规律。它有事实、有议论，是一篇工农群众活学活用毛主席哲学著作的好文章。
    毛主席教导我们：“事物矛盾的法则，即对立统一的法则，是自然和社会的根本法则，因而也是思维的根本法则。”五四三七青年包车组的文章，有力地证明了，学习毛主席所发展了的革命辩证法，自觉地用对立统一规律来研究我们所进行的斗争和工作，掌握它的规律性，就能使我们对客观事物的认识，由浅入深，由必然到自由，就能大大促进人的思想革命化，促进我们所进行的一切革命和建设事业。
    这篇文章，和许许多多工农兵群众的文章，对某些资产阶级代表人物污蔑工农兵群众学习毛主席著作的无耻谰言，是一个有力的回击。马克思主义的哲学，是从群众斗争中产生，并为群众革命斗争服务的活哲学。马克思主义哲学的特点，就是它的阶级性和实践性。工农兵群众是带着浓厚的阶级感情，为了总结革命和建设的经验，为了改造主观世界和客观世界，为了革命而学习毛主席著作的。他们在学习中，能把理论和实践最大限度地结合起来，活学活用，立竿见影。因而他们学得最好，用得最好，在改造主观世界和客观世界中收效也最大。
    毛泽东思想是我们各项工作的指导方针。我们做好一切工作，靠的是毛泽东思想，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。更好地在广大群众、干部中，加强毛泽东思想的教育，用毛泽东思想武装广大群众和干部的头脑，我们的革命和建设事业就无往而不胜。我们要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段。
    开火车的哲学
    铁道部第一铁路工程局乌鲁木齐机务段五四三七青年包车组
    我们包车组成立将近六年了。在党的培养教育下，取得了一定的成绩，也积累了一些经验；但是有时跑起车来，还觉得手忙脚乱，对怎样保证安全正点，心里没个底，经常担惊受怕，怕弄不好一轱辘给国家造成损失。去年，我们学习毛主席关于不断总结经验的指示时，回想了一下几年来开车的情况，发现我们虽然有为革命开好火车的愿望，却没有摸出开好火车的规律。从那以后，我们订出了个跑一趟车就总结一次经验的制度。经过一年多的摸索和总结，渐渐认识了开车中的几个关系问题，使我们心明眼亮了，机车也更加听话了。
    人和车
    人听党的话，车听人的话
    开火车，是人和车的结合。要开好车，车是主要的，还是人是主要的？
    在这个问题上，我们有一些切身体会。
    一九六○年七月，我们开始包这台车时，不是晚点，就是费煤，有时既晚点又费煤。是车不好吗？不是。车是刚出厂的新车。是煤不好吗？也不是。煤也不错。是什么原因呢？是人的原因，人的思想问题。当时我们组的九名青年，是从四面八方来到西北的。到这里一看，风沙比较大，有的同志就不安心。有的说，“一片戈壁滩，风沙没个边，车头受不了，人也费熬煎。”党支部针对这种情况，组织我们学习《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》两篇文章。开始学的时候，一人念，大家听。听着听着，像吃甘蔗，越吃越甜，越听越亲切，越学越感到心明眼亮了。有的说，“我们从五湖四海来到这里，是来干革命的，不是来吃现成饭的。”有的说，“愚公有移山志，这点困难能挡住咱开火车？”接着我们就提出“困难吓不倒英雄汉，风沙挡不住车轱辘转”的口号，决心战胜困难。从那以后，车还是这个车，人还是这些人，可是人的思想变了，开起车来劲头就不同了。段上开展了百站不晚一分钟活动，我们组提出千站不晚一分钟。当时煤的质量虽然差，我们还是取得了万站不晚一分钟的成绩，得到了铁道部的奖励。
    在我们总结这一段工作时，大家认为，这个成绩是听了毛主席的话得来的，所以我们总结了两句话，叫做“人听党的话，车听人的话”。我们把这两句话刻在木板上，钉在驾驶室内，作为我们的座右铭。
    读毛主席的书尝到了甜头，我们就更加爱读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想指导我们的行动。不管发生什么问题，遇到什么困难，我们都坚决做机车的主人，驾驶着机车走；绝不做机车的奴隶。
    经过几年来的实践，我们深深体会到，在人和车的关系上，车是死的，是要人去驾驶的。要开好火车，机车状态好坏固然重要，但是，离开人的主观能动作用，就不能充分发挥机车的作用。机车的牵引力虽然是有一定限度的，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的智慧和力量却是无限的。人要想做机车的主人，没有技术固然不行；但是，只有技术，不突出政治，就会迷失方向，技术就不能充分地为社会主义建设服务。在人和车的关系上，人的因素第一。在政治与技术的关系上，政治第一。
    快和慢
    该快不快，是慢；该慢不慢，会更慢
    我们是个青年包车组。青年人有一股闯劲，跑起车来总想快一点。可是有时我们想跑得快一点，却反而慢了。有一次秦福荣班牵引上行列车，出烟墩站后，遇上了大风，那里又是上坡道。在这种情况下，要跑正点，就需要增大机车牵引力，所以弄得汽、水比较紧张。列车通过土墩站时，如果利用站内坡道小的条件，关小汽门，缓汽缓水，虽然会晚点几分钟，却可以保证以后不再晚点，搞得好，还可以抢出来。但是他们因为怕晚点，没有这样做，却想利用站内的小坡道，加快列车速度；谁知出站以后，汽、水供应越来越紧张，最后被迫关小汽门。想快没有快成，反而晚点更多了。
    有时看起来是慢，结果却反而快了。就在秦福荣班晚点的第二天，陈书华班跑这趟车时，气候条件相同，但他们接受了头一天的教训，车到红柳河车站时，看到汽、水比较紧张，就坚持整好了炉，烧足了汽，然后才发车。虽然晚开了三分钟，结果却提前三分钟到达柳园。
    类似这样的情况，我们在行车中是经常遇到的。我们认识到，快和慢都不是绝对的。该快时一定要快，不该快时就要设法创造条件，在慢中求快。出站、坡前，一定要快。出站不快，前半站一晚点，后半站就会越赶越忙，忙中容易出错；坡前不快，坡上想快也快不起来，不光要晚点、费煤，搞不好还要途停、退坡。汽、水不足的时候，能快也不应该快，如果只图一时的快，带来的却是更慢；在这个时候，就要坚持打好火底，供足汽、水，这样看起来慢了一点，却包含着快的因素，有了快的基础。进站和通过人口稠密的地方，一定要慢。特别是在大风天进站和一早一晚看不清信号的时候，在进入信号不好了望和道岔曲线小的车站的时候，在车站交接班的时候，更要放慢速度，随时准备停车。这些地方和这些时候，最容易发生事故。你想快，一旦发生了事故，只会更慢。
    难和易
    对难，要战略上藐视，战术上重视；对易，要有“兔子当成老虎打”的精神
    在开车中，我们还常常遇到“难”和“易”的问题。有时拉得多，条件困难，却很顺利；有时拉得少，条件好反而出了事。有一次，丛宝库班从尾垭拉了二千一百七十八吨，晚点七分到达柳园。丛宝库是个操纵能手，副司机和司炉也挺棒，他们过去拉过比这趟列车吨数更多的列车，为什么这趟拉得少反而晚点了呢？这是因为他们缺乏思想准备和物质准备，结果遇上风雪，沙子也用光了，造成了晚点。这件事告诉我们，人的因素是难和易互相转化的决定因素。因为难拉的列车，一般容易引起重视，有战胜困难的思想准备和物质准备；好拉的车，容易松懈麻痹，一旦遇到困难，就会惊惶失措。在行车中，不光在拉得多与拉得少、好天气与坏天气之间有难和易的问题，在上坡与下坡、白天与晚上、单机与列车之间，也都有难和易的问题存在，都需要我们自觉地做变难为易的转化工作。因此，我们认识到，对待困难问题，要像对待敌人一样，战略上藐视它，战术上重视它；对待容易的问题，要有“兔子当成老虎打”的精神。
    大事和小事
    大事可以变小，小事可以变大
    过去我们在跑车中，对大事情是注意的，认为只要抱住西瓜，丢几粒芝麻没有啥。谁知就在这个“没有啥”的思想上，碰了钉子，吃了苦头。有一段时间，我们车的风缸安全阀间断漏风，大家觉得没有啥，没有及时处理。一天正准备出库，安全阀发了脾气，一个劲地向外窜气，如果在几分钟内处理不好，就要晚点出库；半小时内处理不好，就要造成列车晚点。还有一次，机车过水软管松了，滴滴答答地向下流水，也是在“没有啥”的思想支配下，认为不是要害地方，没有及时紧固。谁知车到区间，接头脱了，水柜里的水哗哗地向外流，如果不急速处理，几十吨水很快就会跑光，机车就要熄火，列车就要撂在半道上。虽然这两次紧急情况都由于处理得好，没有造成什么损失，但是一想起来，还心有余悸。
    为什么小事情上吃了大苦头呢？主要是我们把大事和小事看成是一成不变的，不懂得小事情发展到一定的程度就会变为大事。发生了这两件事以后，我们认识到，西瓜要抱，芝麻也不能丢。并且订立了见活就修、交班不留活的制度，不让小事漏过。这样，行车就有主动权了。
    一般和特殊
    地点变了，条件变了，处理问题的方法也应有所不同
    戈壁滩的气候，变幻无常，特别是在春秋两季，有时一天之内气温的差别就很大。这给机车油润工作带来许多困难。过去，我们没有认识到气候对油润的影响，还按照在内地行车的老办法给油。结果，一天之中，同样浇油，白天往外冒，夜间喝不饱。刮风天气，我们总怕迎风的一面缺油，猛劲往里灌，想不到缺油的却是背风的一面。为了使机车有良好的油润状态，保证列车安全正点，我们动了不少脑筋。有的同志说：“这鬼天气，真不好琢磨！”这句话，对我们的启发很大。正因为不好琢磨，我们就更要用心琢磨。我们发现：地点变了，条件变了，我们还是按照内地跑车的老办法给油，这咋能不碰钉子呢？以后，我们就摸索在特殊气候情况下做好机车油润工作的办法。
    我们发现，戈壁滩的气候尽管千变万化，但是，最主要的，还是“冷”“热”“风”三个基本因素。我们就针对这三个基本因素采取对策。冬天天寒，油容易凝结，我们就注意经常保持油路通畅。夏天太阳曝晒厉害，我们就注意做好机车朝阳一边的油润工作。秋天气温变化大，时冷时热，我们就作好对付冷和热的两套准备。比如，天冷了换细油芯，天热了换粗油芯，这样就可以保持适当的油量了。风天油眼容易堵塞，油膜容易破坏，部件容易拉伤，我们就在主要处所安上了防沙挡板，对付风对油润的影响。我们还发现，迎风的一面气流大，背风的一面空气稀薄，因此外来的风和机车卷起来的尘土，往往向背风一面旋刮。根据这一点，风天给油，我们特别注意向背风一面浇。这样从戈壁滩的具体情况出发，对症下药给油，一把钥匙开一把锁，机车的油润状况就比较好了。
    表扬和批评
    受到表扬找缺点，听了批评鼓干劲
    几年来，我们受到领导和同志们的表扬多，受到的批评少。在这种情况下，有的同志思想养娇了，听到表扬，心里乐滋滋的，偶尔听到批评，就有些受不了。去年以来，我们就自觉地与这种情绪作斗争，并逐渐对表扬和批评有了一些新的认识。
    为什么表扬比批评多呢？因为表扬来得比较容易，只要我们有了一点好的表现，领导上和同志们为了鼓励我们，就向我们提出表扬；我们有了缺点，领导上和同志们总是经过再三考虑，才向我们提出来。这样一分析，我们就觉得批评比表扬更可贵，更来之不易。认识到这一点以后，我们受到表扬不自满，并且从表扬的反面找我们不足的地方；受到批评不灰心，认真对待，坚决改正。
    批评和表扬，表达形式虽然不同，但是它的目的却是相同的，都是为了促进我们继续进步。另外，我们还体会到，批评的另一面有表扬，表扬的另一面也有批评。比如有一次，刘俊林在客车上遇到车辆段一位跟班劳动的干部，他表扬我们组的同志对待检车人员态度和蔼，要多少暖汽就送多少暖汽。我们研究这次表扬时，觉得这既是表扬，也是批评。因为气候变化，我们在机车上是最先感觉到的，我们应该及时调整暖汽才对。我们没有做到这一点，却等检车人员来要暖汽，这正说明我们为旅客考虑得不周到。从那以后，我们就主动留意气候变化的情况，随时调整暖汽。
    闯和保
    成绩是闯出来的，消极地去保是保不住的，只有闯才能够取得更大的成绩
    还在前年的时候，我们看到机车安全行走公里越来越多了，害怕出了事故，丢掉成绩，开始产生了保成绩的思想。特别是去年五月，报纸上发表了我们组的事迹，并把我们组和全国一些有名的先进集体和先进人物列在一起，我们就认为这下子是“窗户眼里吹喇叭——名（鸣）声在外了”，保成绩的思想就突出了。有了保成绩的思想以后，我们的闯劲小了。表现在多拉快跑上，采取了谨小慎微的态度，表面上说是要“稳”，实质上却是怕拉得多跑得快容易出事故，影响成绩。以后，在党组织的帮助下，我们认识到“保”就是停止的论点。这使我们的思想又提高了一步，闯劲也就随着增加了，在东线（柳园至疏勒河）掀起了超轴高潮：按规定是两千一百吨，但是我们最高曾达到两千三百四十二吨。近一年来，技术改造的项目也由二十七项提高到了三十五项。
    通过对保成绩的思想的检查，我们回想了过去走过的路，认识到成绩总是伴随着“闯”字而来。越保闯劲越小，成绩也就不能得到刷新。成绩这个东西，好比逆水行舟，不进则退。你想保，但是别人前进了，你就落后了。我们工人阶级是不断革命论者，应该不断地闯，不断地前进，不能只是保，停留在原地。
    我们还认识到，闯和保的实质问题，是个公和私的问题。思想里有了“公”字，想到我们开车是为了革命，为了支援世界上三分之二受苦受难的人民的解放事业，就会有一股闯劲，把成绩放在一边，一切从零开始，无所顾忌，勇往直前，闯出新的成绩来。思想里“私”字冒了头，怕丢了成绩，想保成绩，结果只能停止不前，无所作为。保成绩，说穿了，无非是为了保住自己的名和利。认识到了这个问题，我们就坚决和保成绩的思想决裂，决心永远当革命的闯将。
    我们对一些问题的认识，还仅仅是开始。就是我们在上面谈到的几个问题，认识也还是很肤浅的。在我们的思想认识上，还有许多问题有待解决；在我们的工作中，也还有许多规律，有待我们在实践中去摸索，去掌握。我们坚信，只要我们时时处处突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造思想，一心为人民，一心为革命，不怕难，不怕累，不怕苦，不怕死，向先进学习，向兄弟包车组学习，就一定能认识到更多的问题，克服前进中的重重困难，掌握更多的行车规律，取得更多的自由，变被动为主动，把工作做得更好，为中国革命和世界革命的事业贡献更大的力量。
