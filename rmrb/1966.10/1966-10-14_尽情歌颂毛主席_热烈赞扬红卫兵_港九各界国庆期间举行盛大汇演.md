	Hong Kong and Kowloon communities held over twenty grand National Day performances during the National Day period. Performers on stage enthusiastically sang praises of the great leader Chairman Mao and warmly applauded the Red Guards, the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, and were warmly welcomed by the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

	Under the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon performed five poems by Chairman Mao, including "West Lake Moon," "Seven-Character Regular Verse: The Long March," "Seven-Character Regular Verse: The People's Liberation Army Occupies Nanjing," "Seven-Character Quatrain: For a Female Militia Member," and "Red Cliff: In Response to Comrade Guo Moruo," using the Cantonese opera form. The five poems were interspersed with recitations, forming a magnificent revolutionary epic. During the performance, the audience repeatedly cheered and applauded for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The Cantonese opera "Salute to Revolutionary Youth," performed by a typesetter, received cheers from the audience after every line.

	Over a hundred patriotic film workers performed the grand item "Brilliant Day," using a combination of quick-talk, songs, dialogues, poetry recitations, and performances to enthusiastically sing praises of Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao. The songs "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm," performed by the education and news sectors, were the most familiar and popular with the audience. These two songs have now become household names among the patriotic people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.
