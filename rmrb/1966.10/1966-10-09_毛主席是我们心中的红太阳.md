Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Our great leader Chairman Mao is a beacon, a helmsman, a savior, and the sun. From the bottom of our hearts, we wish our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, long live, long live, ten thousand years!

Because we have grasped the fundamental task of studying Chairman Mao's works, people change, the land changes, the mountains and rivers change, everything changes.

	— Zhou Ming Shan

Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of our times. Chairman Mao's books are the books of the laboring people seeking liberation. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of the revolution. In our hearts, there is only one sun, and that is our great leader Chairman Mao. There is only one truth, and that is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. There is only one resolve, and that is to forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

	— Huang Zu Shi

Everyone says the sun is warm, but it is not as warm as Mao Zedong Thought; everyone says the mother is dear, but the Party is even dearer!

Chairman Mao, you are the helmsman of the world's revolutionary people. To support the world's revolutionary people, you point in any direction, and I will charge forward. If you want me to make charcoal, I will be Zhang Zide; if you want me to plug a gun hole, I will be Huang Jiguang...

Sunlight, air, and grain can only keep one alive. Mao Zedong Thought gives people wisdom and strength, making them brave and diligent.

	— Wang Yu Chang

Because of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I have today's Chen Yonggui. Chairman Mao cares deeply for the laboring people, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have a deep class affection for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's books, I have always loved to read; Chairman Mao's words, I have always loved to hear. People will eventually grow old. It is not scary to grow old in age, but it is scary to grow old in thoughts. Chairman Mao's books, study them until old age; Chairman Mao's words, listen to them every day, in every matter, and thoughts will not grow old. The older, the more revolutionary; the older, the stronger. This is the true revolutionary.

	— Chen Yonggui

We revolutionary youth, no matter at any time, in any situation, are firmly convinced and unyielding in our belief in Mao Zedong Thought. Even if it means climbing a knife mountain or entering a sea of fire, we will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do; wherever Chairman Mao points, we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will resolutely go, without the slightest hesitation.

	— Zhang Chun Yu

Respected Chairman Mao, every time I hold your book, my heart is filled with inexhaustible happiness. Without you, there would be no New China, and there would be no me, a woman from the mountains. You taught me to recognize the revolutionary path, giving me a new life. Wisdom comes from you, and the courage to struggle comes from you. I am not afraid of anything, except failing to be your good student.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought by more people will reduce the possibility of revisionism in China and the danger of capitalist restoration, ensuring that our descendants will remain red and revolutionary forever.

	— Huang Shun Yu

Chairman Mao's works are to me like food and weapons, like the steering wheel of a car. People cannot live without food, soldiers cannot fight without weapons, and a car cannot be driven without a steering wheel. Revolution cannot be carried out without studying Chairman Mao's works.

The more Chairman Mao's works are studied, the deeper the study, the clearer the thoughts, the broader the mind, the firmer the stance, and the greater the ideals.

In every cell of my body, the blood given by the Party and Chairman Mao permeates.

	— Lei Feng

Chairman Mao's books are books of revolution, liberation, defending the country, and progress. To carry out revolution, seek liberation, defend the country, and progress, one must strive to study Chairman Mao's works.

	— Li Su Wen

Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Looking at people, the sky, and the earth according to Chairman Mao's words, the direction is clear, and the strength is great. Without Chairman Mao's books, one's eyes are dark, unable to distinguish right from wrong.

Chairman Mao's works are the treasure of the revolution, our lifeblood, the eternal red sun in our hearts. Whoever opposes it is a counter-revolutionary, our enemy. Chairman Mao's books, we will study them for sure, not only in the past and now, but for thousands of years and forever. Whoever opposes us studying Chairman Mao's works, we will overthrow them without mercy.

	— Lü Yu Lan

Chairman Mao's works are worth more than a thousand pieces of gold, the more you study, the truer the ideology.

Teaching me to clearly distinguish love and hate, teaching people to become more intelligent with every study.

To join the army for the truth, to give my heart to the people.

Willing to be a screw in the revolution, to defend the seas and annihilate the enemy.

	— Mai Xian De

I study a bit of Chairman Mao's books and do a bit, studying and doing at the same time. The more I study and do, the more I feel that Chairman Mao's words are all written for us laboring people, all revolutionary truths. Doing as Chairman Mao's words say, it works every time, hits the mark every time.

	— Yang Fu Zhen

Iron cannot become steel without being tempered, and a worker cannot grow healthily without studying Chairman Mao's works.

	— Jie Yue

Chairman Mao's books made me understand that the victory of the people's revolution is achieved through the sacrifices of thousands and tens of thousands of people. To achieve victory by bearing such sacrifices is the greatest pride and joy of us communists. If it is necessary to sacrifice for the communist ideal, each of us should and can remain calm and steadfast.

	— Ou Yang Hai

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the foundation for us to do revolutionary work well and is the source of strength and happiness for the people of the whole country and the world!

With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything. The fate of our proletariat is closely linked with the great and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

	— Feng Fu Sheng

Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength and the foundation of all victories. The more Mao Zedong Thought there is, the more spirit a person has, and the more production advances.

Chairman Mao teaches us to be "oxen for the people." I have been raising cattle since I was young and know the temperament of cattle. Cattle are good, work hard, and enjoy the least. I am willing to be an old yellow cow for the Party and the people for life, read Chairman Mao's books for life, strive hard for life, honestly execute the leadership's instructions, and wholeheartedly do revolutionary work, building the oil field well.

	— Wang Jin Xi

With Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, standing at the doorstep, looking at all of China, thinking of the whole world; holding a hoe, with endless strength.

Reading Chairman Mao's books, I have completely changed. My eyes have become sharper, distinguishing good from bad; my ears have become more sensitive, hearing good from bad; my mind has become clearer, distinguishing socialism from capitalism; my thoughts have become better, replacing selfishness with a red heart.

	— Gu A Tao

Brave one! You must always remember Chairman Mao's words. Forgetting Chairman Mao's words is like forgetting the past hardships and your responsibility. You should study Chairman Mao's works well. Hasn't Lei Feng set an example for you?

	— Liu Ying Jun

In the face of the enemy's butcher's knife, at the critical moment of life and death, it was Mao Zedong Thought that gave me the endless strength to defeat the Kuomintang bandits and become a hard-boned proletarian; after losing both hands, it was again Chairman Mao's shining "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" that gave me endless revolutionary will, overcoming all kinds of unimaginable difficulties.

	— Xu Xue Hui

Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun just rising in the east. It shines with boundless rays, dispelling the darkness, and illuminating the hearts of the oppressed people. Mao Zedong Thought is like a lighthouse standing on the shore. It shines red light without stopping, guiding the sailors to the right direction. Mao Zedong Thought is like the best weapon. People who master it can distinguish friends from enemies and stand firmly.

A train off the tracks cannot move an inch, and a revolutionary soldier without studying Chairman Mao's works will be confused.

	— Wang Jie

We must quickly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, achieve ideological revolutionization, and the thorough victory of the Chinese and world revolution will come sooner, and the ideal of communism will be realized sooner.

	— Liao Chu Jiang

    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳
    我们的领袖毛主席是灯塔，是舵手，是救星，是太阳。我们从心眼里希望我们最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
    由于我们抓住了学习毛主席著作这个根本的根本，人在变，地在变，山河在变，一切在变。
    ——周明山
    毛主席是我们时代的伟大舵手，毛主席的书是劳动人民翻身求解放的书，毛泽东思想是革命的命根子，我们心中只有一个太阳，就是伟大的领袖毛主席，只有一个真理，就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，只有一个决心，就是永远做毛主席的好战士。
    ——黄祖示
    人人都说太阳暖，比不上毛泽东思想暖；人人都说母亲亲，党比母亲更加亲！
    毛主席，您是世界人民革命的舵手。为了支援世界人民的革命，您指向那里我就冲向那里。您要我去烧木炭，我就作张思德；要我去堵枪眼，我就去作黄继光……
    阳光、空气、粮食，只能使人活着。毛泽东思想，还能给人智慧和力量，使人勇敢和勤劳。
    ——王裕昌
    有了共产党、毛主席，才有我今天的陈永贵。毛主席对劳动人民无限关心，贫下中农和毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情。毛主席的书，我一直爱读，毛主席的话，我一直爱听。人总有一老。不怕年纪老，就怕思想老。毛主席的书，活到老，学到老；毛主席的话，天天听，事事听，思想就能不老。越老越革命，越老越坚强。这才是真正的革命者。
    ——陈永贵
    我们革命的青年，不管在任何时候，在任何情况下，对毛泽东思想都是坚信不疑，坚定不移，就是上刀山，下火海，我们也坚决按照毛主席指示办事。毛主席他老人家怎么说，我们就怎么做，毛主席他老人家指到哪里，我们广大工农兵群众就坚决做到哪里，决不会有半点含糊。
    ——张春玉
    敬爱的毛主席，我每次捧起你的书，心里就有千言万语也说不尽的幸福。没有你就没有新中国，也就没有我这个山沟里的妇女。你教我认清了革命的路，给了我一个新生命。智慧从你那里来，斗争的胆略从你那里来。我什么都不怕，只怕不能当你的好学生。
    掌握毛泽东思想的人越多，在中国产生修正主义的可能就越小，资本主义复辟的危险也就越少，这才能保证咱们的后代一代接一代永远不变色，永远革命。
    ——黄顺玉
    毛主席著作对我来说，好比粮食和武器，好比汽车上的方向盘。人不吃饭不行，打仗没有武器不行，开车没有方向盘不行，干革命不学毛主席著作不行。
    毛主席著作学的越多，学的越深，思想越开朗，胸怀越广阔，立场越坚定，理想越远大。
    在我周身每个细胞中，都渗透着党和毛主席所给予的血液。
    ——雷锋
    毛主席的书是干革命的书，是求解放的书，是保江山的书，是求进步的书。要干革命，要求解放，要保江山，要进步，就得努力学习毛主席著作。
    ——李素文
    毛主席的话，句句是真理。按着毛主席的话去看人、看天、看地，方向明，力量大。离开了毛主席的书，就两眼乌黑，分不出个黑白。
    毛主席著作是革命的法宝，是我们的命根子，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳，谁要是反对它，谁就是反革命，谁就是我们的敌人。毛主席的书，我们是学定了，不但过去学，现在学，还要千年万代永远学，谁反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就把谁打倒，毫不留情。
    ——吕玉兰
    主席著作胜千金，越学越觉主义真。
    教我爱憎倍分明，教人越学越精灵。
    为了真理来当兵，掏尽红心为人民。
    甘当革命螺丝钉，坚守海疆歼敌人。
    ——麦贤得
    毛主席的书，我学一点做一点，一边学一边做。越学，越做，我越觉得毛主席的话，句句都是为我们劳动人民写的，句句都是革命的真理。照毛主席的话去做，百用百灵，百发百中。
    ——杨富珍
    铁不炼，不成钢，当工人，不学毛主席著作不能健康成长。
    ——解悦
    毛主席的书使我懂得了：人民革命的胜利，是要千百万人的牺牲去换取的，为了胜利而承担这种牺牲，是我们共产党人最大的骄傲和愉快。如果需要为共产主义理想而牺牲，我们每一个人都应该也可以做到脸不变色，心不跳。
    ——欧阳海
    伟大的毛泽东思想是我们做好革命工作的根本，是全国人民和全世界人民力量和幸福的源泉！
    有了毛泽东思想，就有了我们工农兵的一切。我们无产阶级的命运与伟大光辉的毛泽东思想紧密地联系在一起。
    ——丰福生
    毛主席思想是力量的源泉，是一切胜利的根本。毛主席思想多一分，人的志气就增加一分，生产就前进一步。
    毛主席教导我们要当“孺子牛”，我从小放牛，知道牛的脾气，牛好得很，出力很大，享受最少，我就心甘情愿为党、为人民当一辈子老黄牛，读一辈子毛主席的书，艰苦奋斗一辈子，老老实实执行好领导的指示，忠心耿耿干革命，把油田建设好。
    ——王进喜
    我头脑里有了毛泽东思想，站在家门口，眼望全中国，想到全世界；手拿锄头柄，力气用不尽。
    我一读毛主席的书，完全变了样，眼睛变得尖了，好人坏人分得清了；耳朵变得灵了，好话坏话听得出了；脑子变得清了，社会主义、资本主义辨得明了；思想变得好了，私心换上了红心。
    ——顾阿桃
    英俊啊！你要永远记住毛主席的话，忘掉了毛主席的话就等于忘掉了过去的苦处和你的责任，你应当很好地学习毛主席著作，雷锋不是给你作出榜样了吗？
    ——刘英俊
    在敌人的屠刀面前，在生死抉择的紧要关头，是毛主席思想给了我战胜国民党匪徒、做无产阶级硬骨头的无穷的力量；在我失去双手以后，又是毛主席的金光闪闪的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，给了我使不完、用不尽的革命毅力，克服了种种不可想像的困难。
    ——徐学惠
    毛泽东思想像东方刚刚升起的太阳，它放出万丈光芒，赶走了黑暗，把被压迫的人们的心照得透亮。毛泽东思想，像直立在岸边的灯塔，它一刻不停地闪耀着红光，给航行的人指明了方向。毛泽东思想，像一件最好的武器，人们掌握了它，就能够分清敌我，站稳立场。
    火车离开了轨道就寸步难行，革命战士不学习毛主席著作就晕头转向。
     ——王杰
    我们只有赶快用毛泽东思想武装起来，实现思想革命化，中国和世界革命的彻底胜利才能早一天到来，共产主义的理想才能早一天实现。
