The Socialist Motherland Led by Chairman Mao is the Strongest Backing for Overseas Chinese

Zhanjiang Holds Grand Meeting to Welcome Overseas Chinese Returning from Indonesia

More than a thousand overseas Chinese receive warm welcome from compatriots, and their lives are properly arranged

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, October 11th: Various sectors of the people in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, held a grand meeting this morning to warmly welcome the first batch of overseas Chinese who suffered harm and returned to the country on the Guanghua ship from Indonesia on the 10th.

Overcoming the numerous obstacles set by the Indonesian authorities, the overseas Chinese who suffered harm and returned to the country across the vast ocean were in high spirits and full of joy today. Each person wore a shining Mao Zedong badge on their chest and held a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," supporting the elderly and leading the young to participate in the meeting. The crew members of the Guanghua ship, who excellently completed the task of transporting this batch of overseas Chinese who suffered harm back to the country, also participated in the meeting.

Lin Yixin, Vice Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and Vice Chairman of the Reception and Settlement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese, spoke on behalf of the People's Republic of China Reception and Settlement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese. He extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the returning overseas Chinese who suffered harm. He said, under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the inspiration of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and with the support of 700 million people of the motherland, you have bravely fought against the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia. You were not afraid of beheading, not afraid of burning, not afraid of threats, not tempted by bribes, and broke through numerous difficulties to return to the embrace of the motherland. You have maintained the dignity of our socialist motherland and are truly good sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation!

Lin Yixin strongly protested against the large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities launched by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces since last October, which have brutally persecuted overseas Chinese. He said that the Chinese government, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, has repeatedly negotiated and struggled with the Indonesian government, achieving victory in this struggle to transport the overseas Chinese who suffered harm. In the future, we will continue to send ships to transport overseas Chinese who wish to return to the country and have been harmed.

Lin Yixin said, we warn the Indonesian government: you will not gain any benefits from anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities. The powerful socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces must stop all anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities; otherwise, you will reap what you sow.

Lin Yixin then spoke about the current domestic and international revolutionary situation. He hoped that the overseas Chinese would strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, promote their own ideological revolution, actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, and contribute their strength to our great motherland.

Zhao Zhuoyun, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province and Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Reception and Settlement Committee for Returning Overseas Chinese, spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee and all the people of the province, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the returning overseas Chinese who suffered harm, and expressed strong indignation and protest against the crimes committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in persecuting overseas Chinese.

Wang Suying and Zhang Guichang, representatives of the overseas Chinese who suffered harm, spoke at the meeting. They, on behalf of the overseas Chinese who suffered harm, expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the people of the motherland and to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. Wang Suying said, we, the broad masses of overseas Chinese, in the struggle against the brutal enemy, drew endless strength from the socialist motherland, from the 700 million people of the motherland, and from the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the "temporary shelter" in Medan, we, the refugees, had fought face-to-face with the Indonesian reactionaries, American spies, and Kuomintang spies many times with bare hands. We, the refugees, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthened our unity, adhered to principles, and men, women, old, and young were not afraid of the military police's suppression and intimidation. We fought them off with stones, sticks, and fruit pits, making them flee with their tails between their legs. She expressed that the returning overseas Chinese who suffered harm would, together with the people of the entire country, contribute to the cause of the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, take Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande as examples, and become good sons and daughters of the Mao Zedong era. Zhang Guichang, with great indignation, exposed the bloody crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in their anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities and the brutal persecution of overseas Chinese through his personal experiences.

Peng Deqing, Vice Minister of Communications, also spoke at the meeting. He encouraged all the crew members of the Guanghua ship to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to strive for new and greater victories in the struggle to transport the overseas Chinese who suffered harm.

Others who spoke at the meeting included the representative of Indonesian returnees, former Chairman of the Jakarta Overseas Chinese Association, Lie Yuezeng, the representative of the Red Guards of Zhanjiang City, and the representative of the crew members of the Guanghua ship. The overseas Chinese who suffered harm repeatedly raised their arms and shouted at the meeting: "The powerful socialist motherland is the strongest backing for overseas Chinese!" "Strongly protest against the persecution of overseas Chinese by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, October 11th: The first batch of overseas Chinese who suffered harm and returned to Zhanjiang received a warm welcome from their compatriots. The 1,006 refugees, after disembarking on the 10th, were settled in the Overseas Chinese Service Center in the seaside area of Zhanjiang, which has a beautiful environment. Some refugees, whose health was damaged by the persecution of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, were sent to the hospital for treatment as soon as they stepped onto the pier; many elderly, disabled, pregnant, and postpartum overseas Chinese were settled in special wards set up in the refugee living quarters, where nurses and service personnel took care of them. The refugees expressed their boundless gratitude for the deep care of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    据新华社湛江十一日电　广东省湛江市各界人民今天上午隆重集会，热烈欢迎十日乘光华轮从印度尼西亚归国的第一批受害华侨。
    战胜印度尼西亚当局所设置的重重障碍，远渡重洋回到祖国的受害华侨们，今天精神焕发，喜气洋洋，人人胸前佩着金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章，手里拿着《毛主席语录》，扶老携幼前来参加大会。出色地完成了接运这批受害华侨回国任务的光华轮的船员们，也参加了大会。
    华侨事务委员会副主任、接待和安置归国华侨委员会副主任委员林一心，在会上代表中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会，对归国的受害华侨们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。他说，你们在党和毛主席的关怀下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的感召下，在祖国七亿人民的支持下，同印度尼西亚右派反动势力进行了英勇的斗争。你们不怕杀头，不怕火烧，不畏威胁，不为利诱，冲破重重困难，回到了祖国的怀抱。你们维护了我们社会主义祖国的尊严，不愧为伟大中华民族的好儿女！
    林一心对印度尼西亚右派反动势力去年十月以来疯狂地掀起大规模的反华排华活动，对华侨进行惨无人道的迫害表示最强烈的抗议。他说，我国政府为保护华侨的正当权益，同印度尼西亚政府进行了反复的交涉和斗争，取得了这次接运受害华侨斗争的胜利。今后我们还要继续派船接运自愿回国的受害华侨。
    林一心说，我们警告印度尼西亚政府：你们绝不会从反华排华中捞到什么好处。毛主席领导的强大的社会主义祖国是华侨最有力的靠山。印度尼西亚右派反动势力必须停止一切反华排华活动，否则，你们必将自食其恶果。
