Soldiers and officers of the Eighth Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have launched a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have held two "Break Private Interests and Establish Public Interests" study sessions and published several special issues of the "Break Private Interests and Establish Public Interests" wall newspaper. In studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the soldiers and officers bravely examine their own souls, dare to reveal their thoughts, and fiercely combat the "I" in their minds. They thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology. In a word, they firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root in everyone's mind. Below are some excerpts from two issues of the "Break Private Interests and Establish Public Interests" wall newspaper.

Follow Chairman Mao's Words, Break Private Interests and Establish Public Interests

Soldier Liu Zhengqi

After dinner, I went to the service center to buy some things. On my way back, I saw the logistics team unloading lime from a tractor. I wanted to go help, but after taking a few steps, I hesitated: lime is very irritating to the nose, it gets all over you, and it's hot and uncomfortable. Why bother making myself miserable? I turned to leave, but suddenly I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the easy tasks and shirking the hard ones, pushing the heavy burdens onto others and taking the light ones for themselves. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others." Wasn't I doing exactly that, picking the easy tasks and thinking of myself first? Comrade Liu Yingjun sacrificed his precious life for the people, while I was calculating my personal gains and losses, putting the "I" first. Thinking of this, I immediately jumped onto the truck, rolled up my sleeves, grabbed a shovel, and started unloading the lime. Although lime covered my face and body, I felt very happy because I was carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions.

This incident made me realize: to break private interests and establish public interests, one must firmly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, use Chairman Mao's words to guide all actions, and use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to combat the "private" in one's mind. Whatever aligns with Chairman Mao's instructions should be firmly carried out, and whatever does not align should be firmly opposed. In this way, we can achieve victory after victory in the struggle to break private interests and establish public interests, and gradually cultivate a communist worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    北京部队某部八连指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们先后开了两次破私立公讲用会，出了几期破私立公墙报专刊。指战员们在活学活用毛主席著作中，勇于触及自己的灵魂，敢亮思想，狠斗“我”字。大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想。一句话，就是大立毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想在每个人的头脑里扎根。这里刊载的是从两期《破私立公专刊》墙报中选出的一部分学习心得。　——编者
    听毛主席的话，破私立公
    战士　刘争旗
    晚饭后，我到服务社买东西。回来的路上，看见后勤拉石灰的拖拉机正在卸车。我想上去帮忙，走了两步，就犹豫起来：石灰最呛鼻子，飞一身白灰，出一身热汗，烧得浑身疼，多难受，何必自讨苦吃呢？我转身要走，忽然想起了毛主席的教导：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”我这不是拈轻怕重，替自己打算吗？刘英俊同志为了人民能献出自己宝贵的生命，而我却斤斤计较个人得失，“我”字当头。想到这里，我立即跳上车去，卷起袖子，拿起铁锹，卸起石灰来。虽然石灰飞了满脸满身，但我心里却非常痛快，因为我在执行毛主席的指示。
    这件事使我认识到：破私立公，一定要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，用毛主席的话指导自己的一切行动，用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器同“私”字作斗争。凡是符合毛主席指示的就坚决照办，不符合毛主席指示的就坚决反对。这样，我们就能在破私立公、触及个人灵魂的斗争中取得一个又一个的胜利，逐步树立起全心全意为人民服务的共产主义世界观。
