	Washington, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on October 12 that the U.S. government has decided to ease export restrictions on 400 "non-strategic" items to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in order to accelerate the implementation of the Johnson administration's "peaceful evolution" policy towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

	According to reports, these items include food, textiles, chemical products, and metallurgical equipment. Under this regulation, the export of these goods to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries will no longer require special approval from the Commerce Department.

	The U.S. government's move comes amid recent U.S.-Soviet collusion and deals over the Vietnam issue, as well as active efforts to promote the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. On October 7, U.S. President Johnson, in a speech, advocated for greater "reconciliation" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. To this end, he declared that the U.S. would ease export restrictions on the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries as a step towards enhancing so-called "peaceful exchanges."

    加紧推行“和平演变”政策
    美国放宽对苏修集团出口限制
    新华社十三日讯　华盛顿消息：为了加紧推行约翰逊政府对苏联和东欧国家的“和平演变”政策，美国商业部十二日宣布，美国政府决定放宽四百种“非战略”物资对这些国家的出口限制。
    据报道，这些物资包括食品、纺织品、化工产品和冶金设备等。根据这项规定，今后对苏联和东欧国家出口这些商品不再需要商业部的特别批准。
    美国政府采取的这一措施是在最近美苏在越南问题上加紧勾结、大作交易并且积极促进苏联和东欧国家“和平演变”的背景下进行的。美国总统约翰逊七日在一篇演说中鼓吹美苏之间要实行更大的“和解”。为此他宣称美国将放宽对苏联和东欧国家的出口，以作为增进所谓“和平交往”的步骤。
