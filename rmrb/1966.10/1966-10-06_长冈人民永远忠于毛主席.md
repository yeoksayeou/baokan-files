The revolutionary old base area of Jiangxi Province's Xingguo County, Changgang Township, is one of the places where our great leader Chairman Mao personally conducted investigations during the Second Civil War. In the spring of 1929, Chairman Mao came from Jinggangshan to the Yanziwo Xujia Temple in Changgang Township, where he convened a conference of party representatives from Yongfeng, Taihe, Ningdu, and Xingguo. He personally led the people of Changgang in fighting the landlords and redistributing the land. In 1933, Chairman Mao returned here and conducted the famous "Changgang Township Investigation." More than thirty years have passed, but the scenes of Chairman Mao conducting investigations and visits here remain vivid in the hearts of the people of Changgang.

Chairman Mao's words inspire the people of Changgang

The former Changgang Township is now the Changgang Brigade of Changgang Commune.

The people of Changgang have always passed down many stories of Chairman Mao's work here. People say that Chairman Mao, in order to deeply understand the production situation and listen to the opinions of the masses, often held investigation meetings late into the night, and the next morning, he would go to the fields with the masses to participate in labor. Once, Chairman Mao walked to the edge of a field, bent down, picked up a handful of soil, and examined it carefully. Then, he took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his pants, and went into the field to help farmers plant rapeseed. While planting rapeseed, Chairman Mao asked in detail about the local rapeseed yield over the years and discussed rapeseed production methods with the farmers, encouraging them to apply fertilizer rationally. They followed Chairman Mao's words and did as he said, and the rapeseed indeed had a bumper harvest. Since then, the farmers of Yanziwo, when they go to the fields to work, always go to see the place where Chairman Mao worked, and they never forget the instructions of the great leader.

Chairman Mao participating in labor with the masses and discussing production matters forever inspires the people of Changgang. They firmly follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and strive to change the poor and backward face of their hometown. Changgang was originally a place prone to flooding and drought. After the Red Army's Long March northward, it suffered severe destruction by the reactionary Kuomintang, and the surrounding mountains were bare, with serious soil erosion. After liberation, to change the natural landscape, the cadres and farmers here launched a campaign to control the mountains and water. After several years of effort, they finally planted large areas of pine trees on the surrounding bare mountains, effectively controlling soil erosion. Since 1957, they have successively built six relatively large reservoirs and opened and repaired hundreds of ponds, basically eliminating the threat of floods. The former Changgang Township, which made great contributions to the revolutionary war, with eighty out of every hundred young men and women joining the Red Army, has made new contributions to the socialist revolution and construction after liberation, selling a large amount of surplus grain to the state every year.

The people of Changgang, especially the cadres, always remember the scenes of Chairman Mao caring for the people's lives during his investigation here. Once, Chairman Mao and the members of the Central Inspection Team went to the fields to inspect production. Passing by the door of a farmer named Ma Ronghai, they saw two new houses and walked up to ask with a smile: "Is this house newly built?" Ma Ronghai was very excited and replied: "Yes, it was built with the help of the township Soviet. My original half-room thatched house was burned down in a fire this year." "The Communist Party is truly good, solving all the difficulties of the common people!" Chairman Mao listened and nodded. This incident was mentioned by Chairman Mao in both the "Changgang Township Investigation" and the article "Care for the People's Lives, Pay Attention to Work Methods," and was highly praised. In the article "Care for the People's Lives, Pay Attention to Work Methods," Chairman Mao wrote: "The people of Changgang Township say: 'The Communist Party is truly good, thinking of everything for us.' The model workers of Changgang Township, the respectable workers of Changgang Township! They have gained the sincere love of the broad masses, and their calls for war mobilization have been supported by the broad masses."

These teachings of Chairman Mao will forever remain in the hearts of the cadres and people of Changgang. After liberation, the cadres of Changgang are almost all new. However, they follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, like the old cadres, care for the people's lives and sympathize with the people's hardships. They lead the farmers in making revolution, leading them in production and learning culture, and have achieved great success in all aspects of work, earning the enthusiastic praise of the masses, who say they are truly worthy students of Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao once said, "We should create several thousand Changgang Townships." The people of Changgang are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the revolutionary tradition, strive for greater glory, and achieve greater success. They deeply understand that to build Changgang even better, there are thousands of ways, but studying Chairman Mao's works is the first and foremost.

Revolutionary old cadre and old Communist Party member Zhong Yueling often tells people how he kept the book "Changgang Township Investigation" written by Chairman Mao from the Soviet area to after liberation, to inspire and educate people to forever read Chairman Mao's books, forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, and forever act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Now, every household in the Changgang Brigade has Chairman Mao's works and has posted Chairman Mao's quotations. Each production team has a study group for Chairman Mao's works, and cadres and community members all carry Chairman Mao's works with them. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Changgang firmly insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, determined to make Changgang a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 长冈人民永远忠于毛主席

    长冈人民永远忠于毛主席
    革命老根据地江西兴国县长冈乡，是我们伟大领袖毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期，亲自做过调查的地方之一。一九二九年春，毛主席从井冈山来到长冈乡的燕子窝徐家祠，在这里召开过永丰、泰和、宁都、兴国等地党员代表大会，并亲自领导长冈人民打土豪分田地。一九三三年，毛主席又来到这里，作了著名的《长冈乡调查》。三十多年过去了，可是，毛主席在这里作调查和访问的情景，至今仍然留在长冈人民的心里。
    毛主席的话鼓舞着长冈人民
    当年的长冈乡，现在是长冈公社的长冈大队。
    长冈人民中间一直传颂着毛主席在这里工作的许多故事。人们说，毛主席为了深入了解生产情况，倾听群众意见，常常晚上开调查会开到深夜，第二天一清早，又和群众一起下田参加劳动。有一次，毛主席走到一块地边，弯下腰，抓起一把泥土，细细地察看，然后，脱下鞋袜，卷起裤腿，下田帮助农民种油菜。毛主席一边种油菜，一边详细地询问当地历年的油菜产量，和农民们研究油菜增产办法，鼓励他们合理施肥。他们听毛主席的话，按照毛主席说的去做，油菜果然获得了大丰收。从那以后，燕子窝的农民下地劳动时，都特意去看看毛主席劳动过的地方，心里念念不忘伟大领袖的指示。
    毛主席和群众一起参加劳动，商量生产大事，永远鼓舞着长冈人民。他们坚定地按照毛主席指引的方向，努力改变家乡的一穷二白面貌。长冈本来是个易涝易旱的地方，红军长征北上后，又遭到国民党反动派的严重破坏，四周都是光秃秃的山岭，水土流失非常严重。解放后，为了改变自然面貌，这里的干部和农民，开展了治山治水斗争。经过几年的努力，他们终于在四周的光山秃岭上种了大片松树，有效地控制了水土流失。从一九五七年以来，先后修建了六个较大的水库，新开和整修了几百口水塘，基本上免除了水灾的威胁。当年对革命战争有过很大贡献，一百个青壮年男女中就有八十个当红军的长冈乡，解放后又对社会主义革命和建设作出了新的贡献，每年都有大量余粮卖给国家。
    念念不忘毛主席关心群众生活的教导
    长冈人民，特别是干部们，都念念不忘毛主席在这里作调查时关心群众生活的情景。有一次，毛主席和中央检查团的同志到田间视察生产，路过一个叫马荣海的农民家门口，见到两幢新房子，便走上前去微笑着问：这房子是新盖的吧？马荣海非常激动地回答说：“可不是，是乡苏维埃发动大家帮助盖起来的。我原先那一间半草房，今年失火烧掉了。”“共产党真是好，老百姓有什么困难都给解决！”毛主席一面听着，一面点头。这件事，毛主席在《长冈乡调查》和《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》的文章中都提到了，并给予很高的评价。毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文里写道：“长冈乡的群众说：‘共产党真正好，什么事情都替我们想到了。’模范的长冈乡工作人员，可尊敬的长冈乡工作人员！他们得到了广大群众的真心实意的爱戴，他们的战争动员的号召得到广大群众的拥护。”
    毛主席的这些教导，永远留在长冈的干部和人民的心中。解放后，长冈的干部，几乎全是新的一代了。但是，他们按照毛主席的教导，像老一代的干部们一样，关心群众生活，体贴群众疾苦。他们领导农民闹革命，领导农民搞生产、学文化，各项工作都取得了重大的成就，得到了群众的热烈赞扬，说他们不愧为毛主席的好学生。
    读毛主席的书，把长冈建设得好上加好
    毛主席曾经说“要造成几千个长冈乡”。长冈人民决心按照毛主席的教导，发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣，争取更大成绩。他们深深懂得，要把长冈建设得好上加好，千条万条，学习毛主席著作是第一条。
    革命老干部、老共产党员钟月明常对人们讲起他怎样把毛主席写的《长冈乡调查》一书，从苏区时代一直保存到解放以后，以启发和教育人们永远读毛主席的书，永远听毛主席的话，永远照毛主席的指示办事。
    现在，长冈大队家家户户都有毛主席著作，都贴了毛主席语录。每个生产队都有学习毛主席著作小组，干部和社员都随身携带毛主席著作。在进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动中，在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，长冈人民都坚持活学活用毛主席著作，决心把长冈办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
