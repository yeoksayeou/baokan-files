The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about a new look for Guangzhou. The most striking change is seen in the boundless love, faith, and admiration that the revolutionary masses of the entire city have for Chairman Mao, and in the deep penetration of Mao Zedong Thought into people's hearts.

Nowadays, whether in offices, factories, schools, shops, or cultural and recreational venues and residential areas, Chairman Mao's portrait is prominently displayed in the most conspicuous places. Whether on big streets or small alleys, indoors or outdoors, the entire city of Guangzhou is filled with bright red and eye-catching slogans and quotations from Chairman Mao.

Xu Xiaolao, a 68-year-old resident of the waterways, is illiterate and finds it very difficult to write. His home already has several portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao on the walls, but he is still not satisfied. He personally copies two quotations from Chairman Mao, writing them stroke by stroke from a book, and respectfully pastes them in the most conspicuous place in the room. He says, "Chairman Mao is the great savior of our waterway people. I could say a thousand words or write a thousand sheets, but I still cannot express my love for him!"

The revolutionary masses, especially the working people, are even more touching in their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and in their propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. Many housewives on Datang Street study Chairman Mao's quotations for three afternoons every week.

Yong Xiuli's mother, Rong Fengping, is 64 years old this year. She is illiterate and finds it difficult to study Chairman Mao's quotations, but she is not deterred by the difficulties. She says, "My daughter Xiuli always listens to Chairman Mao's words. As her mother, I cannot fall behind. I must study Chairman Mao's works well and actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." She uses the time during cooking and eating to ask her husband and son for help. Now, she can recite many quotations from Chairman Mao and has begun to study and propagate the Sixteen Points, mobilizing the masses to thoroughly criticize the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News."

As Mao Zedong Thought penetrates deeper into people's hearts, many who previously held the old idea of "not asking about state affairs, not caring about public affairs" have now raised their consciousness and actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to care about state affairs. Selfless acts of public service, mutual aid, unity, and friendship are continually emerging. Many retired workers and housewives in Binjiang New Village, after reading Chairman Mao's books, require themselves to have the spirit of "completely selfless and dedicated to others" as White. They voluntarily take on the task of maintaining public hygiene. A group of housewives on Datang Street go to the suburbs to help commune members study Chairman Mao's works, and some elderly women in the same street volunteer to take care of their children and manage their households, allowing them to work with peace of mind.

In many streets and alleys of Guangzhou, Red Guards and Young Pioneers are on duty, not only maintaining revolutionary order but also actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought and reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

    满城语录满城红
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，使广州的面貌为之一新。最突出的变化表现在全市广大革命群众对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜，表现在毛泽东思想的深入人心。
    现在，不管是机关、工厂、学校、商店，还是文娱场所和居民住区，都在最醒目的地方，悬挂着毛主席的画像。不管大街小巷，室内室外，整个广州市处处都写满了鲜红夺目的标语和毛主席语录。
    六十八岁的水上居民徐细佬，没有文化，写字十分困难。他家墙壁上已经贴了好几张毛主席画像和毛主席语录，但他还不满足，亲自动笔一笔一划地对着书本描上两张毛主席语录，恭恭敬敬地贴在屋子最醒目的地方。他说：“毛主席是我们水上人民的大救星，我说千言万语，写千张万张也表达不尽我对他老人家的热爱啊！”
    广大革命群众，特别是劳动人民活学活用毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想的情况更为感人。大塘街许多家庭妇女，每星期都抽出三个下午学习毛主席语录。
    向秀丽烈士的妈妈容凤屏，今年六十四岁了，她不识字，学毛主席语录比较吃力，但是她没有被困难吓倒，她说：“我家秀丽最听毛主席的话，我做妈妈的也不能落后，我一定要学好毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”她利用烧饭、吃饭时间，向老伴和儿子请教。现在，她不仅能背诵许多条毛主席语录，还开始学习十六条，宣传十六条，发动群众大破“四旧”，大立“四新”。
    随着毛泽东思想的深入人心，不少原来抱着“国事莫问，众事莫理”的旧思想的人，现在都提高了觉悟，积极响应毛主席的号召，关心国家大事。舍己为公、舍己为人、互相帮助、团结友爱的好人好事正在不断涌现。滨江新村的许多退休工人和家庭妇女，读了毛主席的书以后，就以白求恩
  “毫不利己专门利人”的精神来要求自己，主动把公共场所的卫生工作担负起来。大塘街一批家庭妇女到郊区帮助公社社员学习毛主席著作，同街的一些老大娘，就自告奋勇地替她们看管孩子，料理家务，让她们安心工作。
    在广州市的许多大街小巷，还有红卫兵和少先队员在站岗放哨，他们的职责不仅在维持革命秩序，还积极宣传毛泽东思想，讲读《毛主席语录》。
