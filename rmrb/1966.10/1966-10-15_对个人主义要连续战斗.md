	Editor's Note: To study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to focus on the "application" aspect, is a method that Comrade Lin Biao has always emphasized. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army have resolutely followed Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They study well and apply well, truly embodying the spirit of thorough reform in their ideological transformation. Even the smallest flaw is not overlooked; any dust in the mind must be swept away, fully demonstrating their noble quality of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly."

	The following five articles written by soldiers use vivid examples to illustrate how studying Chairman Mao's works and focusing on the "application" aspect can greatly promote ideological revolutionization.

	The Battle Against Individualism Must Be Continued

	Five Good Soldier Su Bingjun

	The concept of "I" is a poisonous ideology created by the exploiting classes over thousands of years to harm the people. To criticize, expose, and eliminate it, one must engage in long-term, repeated struggles. Old ideas, like enemies, often disguise themselves and seek legitimacy. Sometimes, you might defeat it in one aspect, but it will soon resurface in another; today you might drive it out of your mind, but tomorrow, if you are not careful, it will return to command you. Therefore, to truly defeat it and ensure it never resurges, one must engage in unyielding struggle against it.

	When I first enlisted, due to my low class consciousness, I found military life difficult and was unwilling to serve. Soon, the company organized a session of recalling bitterness, which educated me greatly. I realized that happy life does not come easily, and to preserve the socialist country's mountains and rivers, one must carry the revolution through to the end. I decided to hold my rifle tightly, defend the motherland, and wholeheartedly serve the people. Just as I began to change, the concept of "I" reared its head again. I thought, what if I didn't do well in the past, and now I do well, will the leaders and comrades believe me? If they say my progress is fake, wasn't all my effort in vain? After my comrades discovered this thought, they enthusiastically helped me. I reread "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and the words "completely" and "thoroughly" echoed in my mind, making me realize that my selfishness was too heavy. I hadn't done anything beneficial for the people, yet I was already worrying about whether my efforts would be recognized or not. Through this struggle, I realized that as long as I established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people and eliminated selfishness, I wouldn't worry about whether the masses believed me or not, and I wouldn't worry about working in vain. Thus, the concept of "I" retreated, and my work enthusiasm rose again. However, soon after, some of my comrades who enlisted with me joined the organization or became squad leaders. This caused my thoughts to fluctuate again, and the concept of "I" resurfaced. I thought: I've been fooled by it before, this time I can't fall for it again. As soon as it shows its head, I'll strike it down. I picked up the "iron broom" of Mao Zedong Thought and swept it away, driving it out of my mind, and I felt very happy.

	After a relatively long period of intense struggle, the concept of "public" gradually grew, and my spiritual appearance changed. I transformed from a backward soldier into an advanced soldier and recently attended the army's conference of activists who study Chairman Mao's works. Although I have made some progress, it is still far from enough. I am determined to follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, to study with questions in mind, to study and apply actively, to combine study and application, to study urgently what is needed immediately, to see results quickly, and to focus on the "application" aspect. I will study Chairman Mao's works for life, do revolution for life, and reform my thoughts for life.

    编者按：活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，这是林彪同志历来强调的学习毛主席著作最好的方法。解放军广大干部战士，坚决遵照林彪同志的指示，开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们学的很好，用的很好，在思想改造方面，真正做到了一个“狠”字。那怕是一个微小的缺点，也不放过，思想上有一点灰尘，也要扫除干净，充分表现了他们“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的高贵品质。
    下面发表的五篇战士写的文章，用生动的事例，说明了学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，对促进人的思想革命化，具有多么巨大的威力。
    对个人主义要连续战斗
    五好战士　苏炳均
    “我”字这个东西，是几千年来一切剥削阶级所造成的毒害人民的旧思想。要批倒它，斗臭它，消灭它，必须经过长期的反复的斗争。旧思想也像敌人一样，常常伪装起来，找合法地位。有时，在这件事上斗倒了它，不久又会从另一件事上冒出来；今天你把它从头脑中赶跑了，明天一不注意，它还会跑回来当“司令官”指挥你。因此，要想斗倒它，叫它永世不得翻身，就必须对它进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    我入伍的时候，由于阶级觉悟低，一到部队就感到生活艰苦，不安心服役。不久连里进行忆苦，自己受到很大教育。认识到幸福生活来之不易，要想保住祖国的社会主义江山永不变色，必须将革命进行到底。我决心握紧手中枪，保卫祖国，安心为人民服务。就在我刚有了转变的时候，“我”字又跳了出来。想什么过去没有干好，现在好好干，领导和同志能相信我吗？要是说我进步是假的，不是白干了吗？这个思想被同志们发现后，就热心地帮助我。我重读了《为人民服务》，“完全”、“彻底”四个大字在我脑海里翻腾着，感到自己私心太重了。自己还没有为人民做一点有益的事情，就考虑起“白干”、“不白干”的问题来了。通过一番思想斗争，我认识到，只要树立了全心全意为人民服务的思想，去掉了私心，就不会担心群众相信不相信的问题，就不会担心“白干”。这样，“我”字又夹着尾巴跑了，工作积极性又起来了。可是，事隔不久，同我一起入伍的同志有的加入了组织，有的当了班长。这一来，又引起了我的思想波动，“我”字又冒出来了。我想：过去吃了它的亏，这回可不能再上它的当了。趁它一露头，就早下手干掉。我拿起毛泽东思想的“铁扫帚”，照着它扫了过去，把它从头脑中扫跑了，自己感到非常愉快。
    经过较长一段时间的激烈搏斗，“公”字逐步成长起来了，精神面貌也改变了。使我从一个后进战士，变为先进战士，最近还出席了部队召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。虽然我有这一点进步，但还做的很不够。我决心按照林彪同志的指示，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫。学一辈子毛主席的书，干一辈子革命，改造一辈子思想。
