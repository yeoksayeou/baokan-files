The first silk spinning and weaving mill in Nanning, which uses cassava cocoons as raw materials, has been completed and is now in trial production.

The Nanning Silk Spinning and Weaving Mill is a product of the Chinese working class holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. The factory buildings were designed and constructed by the workers themselves, and all the machinery was manufactured by them as well. Construction began in April 1965, and by June of this year, the mill was completed and began trial production.

    南宁第一座绢纺织厂建成
    我国新建第一座以木薯蚕茧为生产原料的南宁绢纺织厂，已经建成并试机生产。
    南宁绢纺织厂是我国工人阶级高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生精神的产物。厂房是自己设计、兴建的，全部机器是自己制造的。一九六五年四月开土兴建，到今年六月就建成并试机生产了。
