At the foot of Jiudeng Mountain, in the barren grasslands of Hainanping, there is a "revolutionary crucible" - the "Red Military Horse Farm." This is a horse farm established by a certain unit stationed on the border of Yunnan in southwest China.

Here, a group of new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and imbued with communist consciousness, have personally tilled the land to create a vast pasture, breeding batch after batch of mules and horses that are good at carrying loads and traversing mountain paths for the state.

Four years ago, three cadres and eight soldiers were transferred from the unit, carrying their own luggage and leading eight mares, to the foot of the mountains. With their own hands, they quickly built a simple horse farm. That autumn, they moved from the foot of the mountains to Hainanping to expand the horse farm. There was only a watchtower and three dilapidated houses. That night, they settled the mares in a nearby dilapidated temple, and the cadres gathered around a bonfire, taking care of the livestock while holding a meeting. They resolved: in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and frugal military building, to take timber from the mountains and bricks from the earth, and build the horse farm with their own hands.

In the depths of winter, the weather was bitterly cold. The farm director, Zhang Jialong, shouldered a large axe and led a group of soldiers to camp in the mountains and prepare materials. Felling trees was arduous, and transporting the timber was even more difficult. Faced with one challenge after another, everyone's spirits soared after studying Chairman Mao's teachings on overcoming difficulties. The soldiers said, "No matter how great the difficulties in the world, as long as there are revolutionary people, they can be overcome." There were no roads in the mountains, so they built them; the trees were too large to lift, so they used their "iron shoulders." They jumped into waist-deep river gullies, breaking the ice to float the timber. After countless days and nights of hard work, they finally built hundreds of stables and dormitories on this barren grassland in a makeshift manner.

When the Party organization of the military horse farm discussed the farm's planning, there was a struggle between two different ideas on how to run the farm. Some advocated for large-scale operations, believing that "small-scale operations yield little." They said that running a large horse farm would be grand and the results would be obvious. Other comrades said, "Running the farm should adhere to the spirit of thrift, inheriting and carrying forward the glorious traditions of our army as a fighting force, a work force, and a production force, making great Mao Zedong Thought truly take root in the horse farm. We must follow the path that Chairman Mao pointed out, gradually eliminating the three major differences and transitioning to communism. Doing things bit by bit and persisting for a long time is moving towards communism. This is a great cause, the largest oil spot, and it will spread the fragrance of communism to the world." After the debate, those who originally advocated for a large-scale operation without considering the conditions realized that their ideas were detached from politics, focusing only on material results, which completely went against the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. They said: breeding mules and horses is for military preparedness, but the fundamental military preparedness is to build the farm with Mao Zedong Thought.

The personnel of this military horse farm are not fixed; every so often, some cadres and soldiers are rotated from the grassroots level to participate in the work. When they first arrived at the farm, they often encountered various difficulties. A medical assistant, for example, initially lived on the third floor of the watchtower. This watchtower had been neglected for a long time, and with the strong winds and sand in the area, it was impossible to light a lamp at night, and clothes and bedding quickly became dirty, so he was not content with his work. Some soldiers did not write "military horse farm" on the envelopes of letters to their relatives, believing that this work was not honorable.

The problems reflected by the new personnel were taken seriously by the Party organization, which decided to prioritize cultivating revolutionary people in all work. Whenever new personnel arrived, they organized everyone to study the three articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and held debates around the question of whether revolutionary work has high and low, noble and base distinctions.

In this way, batch after batch of new cadres and soldiers drew a clear line between new and old ideas. Medical assistant Tang Sixiyun not only actively treated diseases for the farm's personnel but also cured many difficult cases for poor and lower-middle peasants. The masses said: he is a good soldier educated by Chairman Mao. College student Cheng Haishen repeatedly studied "Serve the People," first clearing away his own "burden" of being a college student, realizing that a child from a poor peasant family, who was able to graduate from the people's university, was the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's nurturing and cultivation; knowledge comes from the laboring people, and it should be completely used for the Party and the people's cause. He practiced what he preached, fearing neither dirt nor hard work, actively checking the mares' estrus, mastering the timing of mating, and determined to shovel manure for the revolution for a lifetime, becoming a mating technician. After more than two years of tempering, Cheng Haishen was honored to join the Communist Party of China this year.

Once, the third mare died shortly after giving birth. The "orphaned foal" could not find milk and ran around aimlessly. Some people had no confidence in whether the "orphaned foal" could be raised. Livestock keeper Wang Yaofan, who always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people wholeheartedly, volunteered to take care of it. He squeezed milk from other mares, put it in a bottle, and fed the "orphaned foal" mouthful by mouthful. Sometimes he couldn't get milk, so he fed it porridge. During the day, he took it out to graze, and at night, he got up several times to take care of it. Wang Yaofan gradually became thin, and people advised him to take care of his health. He said, "In the past, I herded horses for the landlord and was beaten and bullied; now I am herding horses for the revolution, no matter how bitter and tired I am, my heart is happy." The "orphaned foal" finally grew up. Last November, when Wang Yaofan personally sent it on a truck, everyone happily said, "'The orphaned foal' has joined the army, and Old Wang has added another bit of strength to the army to fight against American imperialism." Such love for horses has become a common practice throughout the farm.

This military horse farm has a history of over four years. Now, all the comrades in the farm, whether cadres or soldiers, praise this military horse farm as "a red military horse farm, a red crucible, and a great school for cultivating communist warriors."

    红色军马场
    军后  时思
    在九顶山脚下海北坪的荒草坝上，有一座“革命的大熔炉”——“红色的军马场”。这就是驻守在祖国云南边疆某部自办的军马场。
    在这里，一批用毛泽东思想武装起来的具有共产主义觉悟的新人，自己动手开垦出来广阔的牧场，为国家培育出来一批批善驮和善走山路的骡马。
    四年前，从部队调来三个干部和八个战士，背着自己的行李，牵着八匹母马，来到苍山脚下，凭着自己的双手，迅速建成了一个简易的军马场。这年秋天，他们从苍山脚下迁到海北坪扩建军马场。这里只有一座炮楼和三间破房。当夜，他们把母马安置在附近的破庙里，干部们围着篝火，一面照料牲口，一面开支委会。决议：根据毛主席的自力更生，勤俭建军的教导，向山要木料，向地要土坯，自己动手建设军马场。
    深冬季节，天寒地冻。场长张家龙肩扛大斧，带领一批战士，上山扎营备料。伐木艰苦，运料更难。在一个个困难面前，大家学习毛主席关于克服困难的教导以后，情绪高涨。战士们说：“任何人间的困难，只要有了革命的人，都是可以克服的。”山上没有道路，他们动手修造；树大难抬，就发挥“铁肩膀”的威力。他们跳进齐腰深的河沟里，破冰流放木料。经过多少个日夜的辛勤劳动，终于在这荒芜的草坝上，因陋就简地建成了上百间马厩和宿舍。
    军马场党的组织在讨论建场规划时，曾经出现了两种办场思想的斗争。有人主张大办，认为“搞‘小磨油’，没多大油星。”他们说办大马场，干起来轰轰烈烈，成效也显眼。另一些同志说：“办场要坚持勤俭精神，继承和发扬我军战斗队、工作队、生产队的光荣传统，使伟大的毛泽东思想真正在马场扎根。”“我们要走的，正是毛主席指出的逐步消灭三大差别，向共产主义过渡的道路。现在一点一点做，长期坚持，就是朝着共产主义走。这是桩顶天大事，油星最大，它会向全世界发出共产主义的芬芳。”经过辩论，原来不看条件主张办大场的人，认识到自己的想法脱离政治，只看物质成果，这就完全违背了毛主席指引的方向。他们说：繁殖骡马是为了战备，但根本的战备是用毛泽东思想建场。
    这个军马场的人员，是不固定的，隔一段时间，就从基层抽换一些干部战士来参加工作。他们一到马场，常常碰到一个个难题。有一个医师助理，初到这里，住在第三层炮楼上。这个炮楼长期失修，加上当地风沙很大，晚上点不着灯，衣被也很快脏了，因此他不安心工作。一部分战士给亲友写信，信封从不写“军马场”三字，认为这个工作不光彩。
    新人员反映出的问题，引起了党组织的重视，决定把培养革命化的人放在一切工作的首要地位。每当新人员来到之后，他们总组织大家学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇文章，并围绕着“革命工作有没有高低、贵贱之分”等问题，进行辩论。
    这样，一批批新来的干部、战士，划清了新旧思想的界线。医师助理唐思云不仅为场里人员积极治病，还为贫下中农治好不少疑难病症。群众说：他是毛主席教育出来的好战士。大学生程海申，反复学习了《为人民服务》，首先清除了自己思想上的大学生
  “包袱”，认识到一个贫农家庭的子弟，能读完人民的大学，是党和毛主席哺育培养的结果；知识是劳动人民给的，要完完全全用于党和人民的事业。他言行一致，说了就干，不怕脏，不怕累，积极检查母马发情，掌握配种火候，决心为革命掏一辈子马粪，当一个配种员。程海申经过两年多的锻炼，今年光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    有一次，三号母马产驹不久病死了。“孤儿马”吃不上奶到处乱跑。有人对能否养活这只“孤儿马”没有信心。时刻牢记着毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导的饲养员王耀藩，主动请求负责饲养。他到别的母马那儿挤回奶汁，装在奶瓶里，把“孤儿马”抱在怀里，一口一口地喂。有时挤不到奶，他就搅面糊喂。白天牵着去放牧，夜里几次起来照料。王耀藩渐渐地瘦下来了，人们劝他注意自己的身体，他说：“过去我给地主放马，挨打受气；现在是为革命养马，再苦再累，心里都痛快。”这匹“孤儿马”终于长大了。去年十一月，王耀藩亲自把它送上汽车时，大家高兴地说：“‘孤儿马’参军了，老王又给部队增加了一分打击美帝国主义的力量。”像王耀藩这样爱马的事，全场已成风尚。
    这个军马场已有四年多的历史了。现在，全场同志，无论干部和战士都称赞这个军马场“是一个红色的军马场，是一座红色的大熔炉，是一座培养共产主义战士的大学校。”
