I have never written an article before, and I don't know how to write one. Recently, in the course of my reception work, I met four Red Guards from Beijing, whose excellent qualities moved me deeply. A strong sense of revolutionary responsibility prompted me to write this piece.

On September 8, these four Red Guard warriors passed through Xian County and came to our reception station. They were students from Beijing Revolutionary Middle School (formerly Beijing No. 51 Middle School), all around sixteen or seventeen years old.

These four Red Guards have very high standards for themselves. They repeatedly declined our offers of help in daily life, saying earnestly, "We are Red Guard warriors. We should do everything ourselves. How can we trouble our comrades?"

At lunchtime, I brought them three bowls of dishes. These were ordinary dishes, but they insisted on taking only one bowl, saying they didn't need so much. I explained repeatedly that this was not special treatment, that everyone ate the same dishes, but they still weren't convinced. Only after they saw with their own eyes that everyone really did eat the same dishes did they reluctantly accept.

After finishing their meal, these four young guests immediately helped the cooks clean the bowls and chopsticks, rolled up their sleeves to wash the dishes, and tidied up the surroundings until everything was clean and neat.

In the afternoon, they had to leave for another place, so they said their goodbyes to us. After they left, we found that the room had been cleaned up very neatly. The bedding was folded squarely, the tables, chairs, and floor had all been wiped clean, the teacups, water bottles, and chairs were all arranged neatly, and on the table they left a thank-you note and the meal fees. They had left more meal fees than necessary, so we quickly rushed to the station to return the excess.

When we got to the station, these four Red Guards were sitting outside the waiting room. I asked them why they didn't go inside to rest. They said, "There are many people taking the bus, so let the elderly and small passengers rest inside. We can rest here too." After boarding the bus, I saw that they were still standing without sitting, letting the seats to other passengers. From Beijing to Hubei, there are thousands of miles. Aren't they tired? I really felt uneasy in my heart.

The bus started, and the smiling faces of these four Red Guards still left a deep impression on me. Watching the bus drive farther and farther away, I was deeply moved. The new generation educated by Chairman Mao is so respectable and lovable! From the bottom of my heart, I congratulate these revolutionary little warriors. I firmly believe that with such a batch of Chairman Mao's Red Guards, our proletarian cultural revolution will definitely achieve victory.

    这样好的红卫兵使我感到自豪
    我从来没有写过稿，也不会写。最近，我在接待工作中，遇到四个从北京来的红卫兵，他们的优秀品质使我感动，一种强烈的革命责任感促使我写这篇稿子。
    九月八日，这四位红卫兵战士路过浠水县城，来到了我们接待站。他（她）们是北京革命一中（原北京五十一中学）的学生，年龄都只有十六、七岁。
    这四个红卫兵对自己的要求十分严格，他们一再婉言谢绝我们在生活上的帮助，恳切地说：“我们是红卫兵战士，一切自己来动手，怎么能给同志们添麻烦呢？”
    吃午饭的时候，我给他们端去三碗菜，这本来是最普通的菜，可是他们坚持只肯留下一碗，说不要那么多。我一再解释这不是什么特殊照顾，大家吃的都是一样的，他们还不放心，直到亲眼看到大家确实是吃一样的菜，才勉强留下了。
    吃完了饭，这四个小客人就立即帮助炊事员收拾碗、筷，卷起袖子洗餐具，把周围收拾得干干净净才罢手。
    下午，他们要去外地，就和我们告别了。他们走后，我们发现房间已经整理得很清洁，被子折得方方正正，桌、椅、地面都抹扫干净，茶碗、水瓶、椅子等都摆得整整齐齐，桌上还留下了一封感谢信和伙食费。他们把伙食费留多了，我们马上赶到车站去退还。
    赶到车站，这四个红卫兵坐在候车室外面。我问他们为什么不到候车室里去休息。他们说：“乘车人多，让老年人和小乘客们在里面好好休息，我们在这里休息也不错嘛。”上车以后，我看到他们依然站在车里没有坐，把座位让给了别的乘客。从北京到湖北有几千里路，他们难道不疲乏么？我心里实在感到不安。
    汽车开了，这四个红卫兵笑盈盈的脸孔，仍然给我留下深刻的印象。我望着越开越远的汽车，心里感动极了。毛主席教导出来的这新的一代，是多么可敬可爱呀！我从心里祝贺这些革命小闯将，我深信有这样一批毛主席的红色卫兵，我们的无产阶级文化大革命，一定能够取得胜利。
