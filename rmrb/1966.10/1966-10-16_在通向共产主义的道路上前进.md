Dear Dad and Mum,

Today, I am writing to you with a heart full of excitement to share my recent thoughts.

Recently, after studying Chairman Mao's instructions on turning the entire country into a revolutionary school, everyone's understanding has deepened. Although I have lived in the revolutionary crucible of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for three years, it is only today that I truly understand its significance. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is indeed a revolutionary school as Chairman Mao described. This school focuses on agriculture, but also teaches military skills, politics, culture, and mass work. The students in this school can wield a hoe to till the land, hold a weapon to fight, and pick up a pen to write articles. I am proud to be a member of this school.

Dear Dad and Mum: The path guided by Chairman Mao is the road to communism. If we only see the labor in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as swinging a spade, dredging canals, or building a levee to complete a quota, that would be too narrow-minded. I am convinced: when we swing our spades, we are digging out the foundations of capitalism and leveling the ruins of the old world. Our spades will surely dig out a communist society.

Dad and Mum: Our school of Mao Zedong Thought has already cultivated many new-type laborers with broad minds and comprehensive development. Our deputy battalion commander, Guo Wenbin, is such a person. He has been in the revolution for twenty years, always with a red heart towards the Party, leading the way in the revolutionary path. He often tells us that his bravery and wisdom are the results of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Now, he is passing on this truth to us.

After becoming the deputy platoon leader, I initially had many concerns, was not very bold in my work, and the masses had complaints. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's works and followed his instructions, overcoming one difficulty after another.

Dad and Mum: I promise you: I will definitely strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, wholeheartedly serve the people, and give my utmost effort in this school of Mao Zedong Thought!

Your daughter,
Zhenghua

    在通向共产主义的道路上前进
    新疆生产建设兵团副连长楼正花的一封家信亲爱的
  爸爸妈妈：
    今天，我以十分激动的心情，向你们汇报我思想上的新收获。
    最近，我们学习了毛主席关于全国都要办成革命化的大学校的指示以后，大家的认识都有提高。我虽然在生产建设兵团这个革命的熔炉里生活了三年，但真正认识到它的意义，还是从今天开始。生产建设兵团就是一个像毛主席所说的那种革命化的大学校。这个大学校以农为主，也学军事，学政治，学文化，也作群众工作。这个大学校里的学生，拿起锄头能种地，拿起武器能打仗，拿起笔杆会写文章。我以能成为这个大学校的一员而感到非常自豪。
    亲爱的爸爸妈妈：毛主席指引的道路，是一条通向共产主义的道路。如果把生产建设兵团的劳动，仅仅理解为抡抡坎土镘，放放水，打好一条田埂，完成一个定额，那就太缺乏革命的胸怀了。我确信：我们抡起坎土镘是在挖除资本主义的墙基，平毁旧世界的废墟。我们的坎土镘一定能够挖出一个共产主义社会来。
    爸爸妈妈：咱们这个毛泽东思想的大学校已经培养了许多具有广阔胸怀、全面发展的新型劳动者。我们的副营长郭文斌就是这样的一个人。他参加革命二十年，从战斗到生产，一直是一颗红心向着党，革命路上打先锋。
    他经常对我们说，他的勇敢和智慧，都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。他现在又把这个真理告诉我们了。
    在我担任了副连长以后，开始顾虑很大，工作不大胆，群众有意见。这时，我就学习毛主席的著作，按照毛主席的指示办事，结果克服了一个又一个的困难。
    爸爸妈妈：我向你们保证：一定努力活学活用毛主席著作，全心全意当人民的勤务员，在我们这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，做出自己最大的努力！
