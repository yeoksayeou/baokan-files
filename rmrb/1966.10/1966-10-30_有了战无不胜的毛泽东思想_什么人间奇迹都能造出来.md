The joyous news of the successful test of China's missile and nuclear weapons has spread around the world, and songs of praise have risen from all five lakes and four seas.

With the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, any miracle can be achieved.

The soldiers and officers who participated in the missile and nuclear weapons test unanimously declared: We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to elevate the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and make new and greater contributions to the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, as people across the nation joyously acclaim the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapons test, they have expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, just like the heroes who participated in this test, and to carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of their souls, so that the great spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought can exert even greater power on all fronts.

Over the past two days, in cities and many rural communes across the nation, thousands and tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets, holding grand rallies and celebratory parades. People of all ethnic groups have used different languages to enthusiastically acclaim, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" They acclaim the new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the brilliant achievements of the Cultural Revolution.

Workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in Anshan, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, and other places have emphasized that the success of our country's missile and nuclear weapons test has boosted people's morale and strengthened their confidence. Everyone has resolved to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and turn factories, communes, schools, and offices into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought. Last night, more than twenty thousand employees and their families at the First Automobile Works in Changchun held broadcast celebration meetings in more than thirty venues. Liu Yingjun's mother, Zhu Xiulan, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" upon hearing the news. She told the Red Guards from all over the country who came to visit, "We were able to successfully test the missile and nuclear weapons at such a rapid speed, primarily because the minds of the Chinese people have the invincible spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought." She encouraged the youth to definitely master Mao Zedong Thought.

Hong Xiu?, the political instructor of the Xiaoxi Island Militia Regiment and a representative of the National People's Congress, said, "The success of our country's missile and nuclear weapons test is the greatest encouragement and support for the revolutionary people of all countries around the world who are fighting against American imperialism. We militiamen of Xiaoxi Island will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen the three implementations of militia work, do a good job in production, and build the island into an iron wall, firmly grasp the rifle, and be ready to annihilate any enemy who dares to invade." Yin Guanglan, a famous folk singer and poor peasant from Feidong County, Anhui Province, wrote a folk song praising the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought despite being ill in bed. He wrote: The people of the nation raise the red flag, launching missiles and nuclear weapons, the joyous news spreads around the world, and songs of praise rise from all five lakes and four seas. The songs of praise rise from all five lakes and four seas, singing the new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the Cultural Revolution bears fruit, and the iron fortress is unshakable!

The people of Shaoshan were overjoyed upon hearing the news. Mao Shusheng, a sixty-something old poor peasant from the Shaoshan Brigade, played the suona and participated in the celebration rally. This old man, who had participated in the peasant self-defense corps in 1925, excitedly said, "In the past, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we revolted with just our hands, a spear, and a rifle; now our country has become strong, and we must follow Chairman Mao to carry the revolution to the end." In Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, from yesterday morning to evening, more than one hundred thousand workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and cadres paraded on the streets with great excitement, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and giant banners.

The workers of the Lanzhou Petroleum Refinery, a model enterprise in the style of Daqing, unanimously pointed out that the success of the missile and nuclear weapons test is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to read Chairman Mao's books as the first need in life. We will turn Mao Zedong Thought into our souls, be good workers of Chairman Mao, and pass down the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.

When the joyous news reached the border ethnic regions of Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, and Ningxia, people of all ethnic groups were overjoyed and enthusiastically acclaimed, "Long live the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao pointed out the policy of self-reliance, striving for progress, collective wisdom, and great cooperation; Chairman Mao gave us the courage to dare to create and dare to win. With Chairman Mao's leadership, we can overcome any difficulty. The facts have proven that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the strongest, bravest, most wise, and most talented. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will produce immense material force and exert unparalleled power.
