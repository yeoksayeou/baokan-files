A soldier has been demobilized and transferred to a new post, seemingly having little to do with his original unit. However, the Party branch of the First Platoon does not see it this way. Through Fan Zhiguo's letter, they discovered that the political and ideological work of the platoon was not yet thorough. They regarded Fan Zhiguo's letter as a live ideological issue delivered to their doorstep. They focused on the question of for whom to serve in the army and for whom to serve, compared it with Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, organized everyone to study and discuss repeatedly, and conducted a live ideological education for everyone.

Political and ideological work is a meticulous and soul-transforming task. To do this work well, one must be good at seizing every representative live ideological issue and not miss any opportunity to educate cadres and the masses. In this way, political and ideological work will be more targeted and truly effective.

The class struggle in the ideological realm is extremely complex. When a person has this or that wrong thought, it often influences others through various channels. Fan Zhiguo's fear of hardship and difficulty spread to the platoon through his letter. If the Party branch of the First Platoon had taken a nonchalant attitude, it would have had a bad influence on the soldiers. However, the Party branch of the First Platoon seized this live teaching material, raised the issue to a principled level to educate the soldiers, not only further raising the soldiers' awareness but also, through the soldier's letter, educating and helping Fan Zhiguo. This platoon Party branch knows how to do political and ideological work. We should learn from their spirit of being thoroughly responsible to comrades and to the Party's cause.

    对同志负责到底
    一个战士复员转业了，在新的岗位上产生了新的思想问题，似乎同原来的单位没有多少关系了。一中队党支部并不这样看。透过樊治国的来信，他们发现了连队的政治思想工作还没有做到家。他们把樊治国的来信看作送上门来的活思想，抓住为谁当兵、为谁服务的问题，对照毛主席的有关教导，组织大家反复学习和讨论，对大家进行了一次活的思想教育。
    政治思想工作，是一项细致的、改造人们灵魂的工作。要做好这项工作，必须善于抓住每一个有代表性的活思想，不放过任何一个可以用来教育干部和群众的好机会。这样，政治思想工作就会更加有针对性，就真正做活了。
    思想领域里的阶级斗争是极其复杂的，一个人有了这样或那样的错误思想，往往会通过各种渠道影响其他人。樊治国怕苦畏难的思想情绪，通过来信反映到了连队，如果一中队党支部采取不闻不问的态度，就会对战士产生不好的影响。而一中队党支部抓住这个活教材，把问题提到原则的高度来对战士进行教育，既进一步提高了战士的觉悟，又通过战士写信，对樊治国进行教育和帮助。这个连队党支部很会做政治思想工作。我们应该学习他们这种对同志、对党的事业高度负责的精神。
