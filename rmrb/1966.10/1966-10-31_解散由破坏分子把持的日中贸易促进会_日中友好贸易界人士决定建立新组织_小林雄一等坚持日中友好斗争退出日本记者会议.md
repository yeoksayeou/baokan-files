East Tokyo, October 26: Japan-China friendship trade circles held a meeting in Tokyo and decided to dissolve the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, which is controlled by saboteurs of Japan-China friendship, and to establish a new organization.

Since this year, some leaders of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, instigated by followers of modern revisionism, have been carrying out anti-China activities under the banner of "Japan-China friendship." They were removed from their posts by the Board of Directors on September 19. However, they still linger in the office of the Promotion Association, continuing their anti-China activities, obstructing the development of Japan-China friendly trade, and splitting the Japan-China friendly trade circles.

One hundred and sixty representatives of friendly enterprises engaged in Japan-China trade established the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association Reform Comrades Association on October 26, deciding to expel the elements that sabotage Japan-China friendly trade, establish a new organization to promote Japan-China trade, and, based on the three political principles, the three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics, promote genuine Japan-China friendship and trade.

Tokyo, October 30: Koyama Yuichi, Chairman of the Japan Press Club, insisted on the just position of opposing American imperialism and developing the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. On October 27, he withdrew from the Japan Press Club, which is controlled by saboteurs of Japan-China friendship, and expressed his intention to resume the progressive movement of Japanese journalists together with others who insist on the correct position.

On October 27, the Japan Press Club held a Board of Directors meeting. Koyama Yuichi and other directors proposed at the meeting that the task of the Japanese journalists' delegation, which is about to visit China, is to firmly support the statement issued by 32 prominent figures from various circles in Japan and the joint statement signed by the delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association and the delegation of the China-Japan Friendship Association, and to further develop the unity between journalists of the two countries. Koyama and others strongly condemned the forces that talk about "Japan-China friendship" but actually sabotage it.

At the meeting, some saboteurs of Japan-China friendship created various pretexts, slandered China, and unreasonably attacked those who are truly dedicated to promoting Japan-China friendship.

Koyama Yuichi solemnly stated: "In order to truly implement the friendship between the peoples of Japan and China and to promote the cause of opposing American imperialism, we cannot work with the saboteurs within the Japan Press Club," and immediately left the venue.

Two directors representing the East Asia News Agency branch and the Asahi Shimbun branch expressed their support for Koyama and left the venue with him. Several other directors also supported Koyama's position in their speeches.

    解散由破坏分子把持的日中贸易促进会
    日中友好贸易界人士决定建立新组织
    小林雄一等坚持日中友好斗争退出日本记者会议
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日中友好贸易界人士二十六日在东京举行大会，决定解散由破坏日中友好分子把持的日中贸易促进会，另成立新组织。
    今年以来，受现代修正主义者的追随者唆使的一部分日中贸易促进会的领导人，打着“日中友好”的旗子进行反华活动，被理事会在九月十九日解除了职务。但是他们仍赖在促进会的事务局里，继续反华，阻挠日中友好贸易的发展，分裂日中友好贸易界。
    一百六十名从事日中贸易的友好企业代表，二十六日成立了日中贸易促进会革新同志会，决定驱逐破坏日中友好贸易的分子，建立促进日中贸易的新组织，根据政治三原则、贸易三原则和政治经济不可分的原则，促进真正的日中友好和日中贸易。
    新华社三十日讯　东京消息：日本记者会议主席小林雄一坚持反对美帝国主义、发展日中两国人民战斗友谊的正义立场，二十七日退出由破坏日中友好分子把持的日本记者会议，并且表示要和其他坚持正确立场的人一道，重新开展进步的日本新闻工作者运动。
    二十七日，日本记者会议举行理事会。小林雄一和其他一些理事在会上主张：即将访问中国的日本新闻工作者代表团的任务是，坚决支持日本各界三十二位知名人士发表的声明以及日中友好协会代表团和中日友好协会代表团签署的共同声明，进一步发展日中两国新闻工作者之间的团结。小林等人强烈地谴责了一些口头上讲“日中友好”、实际上破坏日中友好的势力。
    在会上，一些破坏日中友好的分子制造种种借口，诬蔑中国，无理攻击真正致力于促进日中友好的人。
    小林雄一严正地表示：“为了真正实行日中两国人民的友好，推进反对美帝国主义的事业，不能同日本记者会议内部的破坏分子一道进行工作”，随即退出了会场。
    代表东方通讯社支部和《朝日新闻》支部的两名理事表示支持小林，同他一道退出了会场。另外几名理事也在发言中支持小林的立场。
