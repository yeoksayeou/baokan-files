Upon hearing the news that Chairman Mao had dispatched ships to bring back the first batch of overseas Chinese who had suffered persecution in Indonesia and voluntarily returned to the motherland, a surge of gratitude for the Party and Chairman Mao welled up in my heart, and tears could not help but well up in my eyes.

I am a child of an overseas Chinese family. For generations, my family has suffered exploitation and persecution overseas, leading a very painful life. Only after the liberation of the motherland did we overseas Chinese hold our heads high and feel the pride and honor of being children of the great Chinese nation. My brothers and sisters have all been nurtured and educated by the Party; three of them went to university, two to high school. My younger brother and I, after graduating from high school, became honorable soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Every time I think of this, my heart swells with warmth, and I feel a deep sense of gratitude. From the bottom of my heart, I feel that the great leader Chairman Mao is the savior of overseas Chinese, the unsetting red sun in our hearts.

As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Chairman Mao proposed in "On Coalition Government" to "protect the interests of overseas Chinese and assist those who return to the motherland." After liberation, the Party and the government have consistently safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, which we will never forget. Over the past year, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have launched a wave of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese sentiment, savagely persecuting overseas Chinese. Our government has repeatedly protested against the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, firmly supporting the just struggle of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Recently, despite the various obstacles created by the Indonesian reactionaries, ships were dispatched to bring back the persecuted overseas Chinese. This fully demonstrates the Party and Chairman Mao's meticulous care for us overseas Chinese. With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the motherland as our backing, the era when overseas Chinese were bullied and had no one to rely on abroad is gone forever.

Chairman Mao told us, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The Indonesian reactionaries are also paper tigers. Their frenzied anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-Chinese sentiment are a manifestation of their weakness. This small clique of extreme reactionary fascist forces, with their reactionary atrocities, once again serves as a negative example for the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people, with their glorious tradition of struggle, will further see the path of revolution from these facts and strengthen their revolutionary will. In the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people will be further strengthened and consolidated.

This victory in bringing back the persecuted overseas Chinese is another heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and another stern warning to these anti-Chinese clowns in Indonesia. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with and are not to be provoked. No matter who it is, anti-Chinese sentiment will not be popular and will definitely fail, with no other possible outcome.

    毛主席是华侨的救星
    听到毛主席派船把在印度尼西亚遭受迫害、自愿回国的第一批华侨接运回国的消息后，一股对党对毛主席的感激之情涌上心头，热泪禁不住夺眶而出。
    我是一个华侨的子弟。我家几辈人在海外受尽剥削和迫害，过着非常痛苦的生活。祖国解放后，我们华侨才扬眉吐气，感到作为伟大中华民族儿女的光荣和骄傲。我们兄弟姐妹得到党的培养和教育，三个上了大学，两个上了高中，我和弟弟在高中毕业后，还当上了光荣的解放军战士。每想到这些，我的心就禁不住地一阵阵发热，浑身暖洋洋的。我从心底感到，伟大的领袖毛主席是我们华侨的救星，是我们华侨心中不落的红太阳。
    早在抗日战争时期，毛主席就在《论联合政府》中提出要“保护华侨利益，扶助回国的华侨”。解放后，党和政府一贯维护华侨的正当权益，这是我们永远不会忘记的。一年多来，印尼右派反动势力掀起反华排华浪潮，野蛮迫害华侨。我国政府多次抗议印尼右派反动势力的反华排华罪行，坚决支持在印尼的华侨的正义斗争。最近，又冲破印尼反动派的种种阻挠，派船接运受害华侨回国。这充分体现了党和毛主席对我们华侨的无微不至的关怀。有党和毛主席的领导，有祖国做后盾，华侨在国外受人欺凌、无依无靠的时代已经一去不复返了。
    毛主席告诉我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎”。印尼反动派也是纸老虎。他们疯狂地反共反人民反华排华，正是他们虚弱的表现。这一小撮极端反动的法西斯势力，以他们的反动暴行再一次给印尼人民充当了反面教员。具有光荣斗争传统的印尼人民将从这些事实中，进一步看清革命的道路，增强革命的斗志。在反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的斗争中，中国人民和印尼人民的战斗友谊将日益加强和巩固起来。
    这一次接运受害侨胞的胜利，是对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的又一沉重打击，也是对印尼这些反华小丑们的又一个有力警告。中国人民是不可侮的，也是不好惹的。不管什么人，反华就不得人心，反华就一定失败，而决不可能有别的下场。
