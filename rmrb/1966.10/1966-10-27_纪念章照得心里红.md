Dearest Border Guards:

	Hello! We are young people from Beijing. We are sending you our most beloved Chairman Mao badges, which we wear on our chests, and the portraits of Chairman Mao that we carry with us. We are presenting them to you—our country's good sons, the heroic border guards! Both you and we are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards. Our hearts are tightly connected with Chairman Mao's heart. We look towards Tiananmen Gate every day, and we think of Chairman Mao every day. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao!

	You are guarding our great socialist motherland and fighting for the early liberation of the three-quarters of the world's people who are suffering. You stand guard on the borders of our motherland. Through countless windy and rainy days, countless muddy roads, countless cold winters, and countless scorching summers... you have excellently carried out your glorious mission. But behind you, our great motherland is undergoing earth-shaking, day-to-day, and month-to-month changes! Seven hundred million people are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our dear motherland is everywhere filled with red flags, red books, red slogans, and red smiling faces... shining with red light, like a rising sun!

	Dearest Border Guards, wear the Chairman Mao badges on your chests! Let us wear them on our chests and let our hearts burn brightly red! These badges come from the heart of our motherland, from the side of Chairman Mao. Wear them, and you will see Chairman Mao every day, as if you are always by Chairman Mao's side. You will be full of energy guarding the glorious posts on the border.

	Several Beijing Youths

    纪念章照得心里红最敬爱的边防战士：
    你们好！我们是北京的青年，我们把佩戴在自己胸前的最心爱的毛主席像纪念章，和带在自己身边的毛主席像，双手捧着送给你们——祖国的好儿子，英雄的边防战士！你们和我们，都是毛主席的红小兵，咱们的心和毛主席的心紧紧连在一起。我们天天望着天安门，天天想着毛主席，我们永远心向毛主席！
    你们为了保卫咱们伟大的社会主义祖国，为了世界上正在受苦受难的那三分之二的人民早日解放，守卫在祖国的边疆。多少个风雨天，多少条泥泞的道路，多少个寒冷的严冬，多少个酷热的炎夏……你们出色地执行着光荣的任务。但是，在你们的背后，咱们的伟大祖国啊，正在起着天翻地覆、日新月异的变化！七亿人民正在进行着一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我们亲爱的祖国到处是红旗、红书、红色的标语、红色的笑脸……红光闪闪，像一轮初升的太阳！
    最敬爱的边防战士，把毛主席像纪念章佩戴在你们的胸前吧！让我们胸前戴上它，把心里照个通红透亮吧！这一枚枚纪念章，来自祖国的心脏，来自毛主席的身边，戴上它，您就能天天看见毛主席，就像天天在毛主席身旁，您就会浑身是劲地守卫在边疆的光荣岗位上。
