Recently, the Soviet government unreasonably ordered Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union to suspend their studies and leave the country within a specified time. The Soviet authorities' actions to intensify anti-China sentiments and worsen Sino-Soviet relations are extremely despicable, and we strongly protest!

Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese revolutionary youth are fearless. Chinese students in the Soviet Union have resolutely fought against the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, demonstrating strong revolutionary will. They are truly good students of Chairman Mao. We salute the glorious anti-revisionist fighters! (Accompanying photos)

On October 27, before Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union boarded the train to leave Moscow, they stood on the platform with those who came to see them off and sang "The East Is Red," "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helmsman," and "The Internationale" together.

Students from many Asian, African, Latin American, and European countries studying in the Soviet Union, as well as some Soviet students, came to the station to bid farewell to the Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union.  New China News Agency photographer

Over a hundred staff members of the Chinese embassy and representatives of the Chinese community went to the station to see them off. They held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shining brightly, and bid farewell to the glorious anti-revisionist fighters.  New China News Agency photographer

    向光荣的反修战士致敬！
    最近，苏联政府无理勒令中国留苏学生休学，并限期离开苏联。苏联当局这种加紧反华和恶化中苏关系的行为是十分卑鄙的，我们表示强烈的抗议！
    在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国革命青年是无所畏惧的。中国留苏学生同苏联现代修正主义领导集团进行了坚决的斗争，表现了坚强的革命意志。他们不愧是毛主席的好学生，我们向光荣的反修战士致敬！（附图片）
