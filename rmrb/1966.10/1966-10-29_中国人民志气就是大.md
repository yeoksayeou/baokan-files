The success of our country's missile and nuclear weapon test is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. As a demobilized soldier, I am truly overwhelmed with emotion. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, who collude with each other, attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons, and try to intimidate the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world with nuclear weapons. This successful missile and nuclear weapon test has given them a resounding blow, which is truly heartening!

In the past, imperialists and revisionists said we were incapable of anything. Today, we want to show them that the Chinese people, once stood up, are truly capable. Ironclad facts prove that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are a great people. We have spirit, wisdom, and strength. Relying on the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, we have created miracles that shake the world time and again.

The great victory of our country's successful missile and nuclear weapon test once again demonstrates the power of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the result of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, workers, and scientific and technical personnel participating in the nuclear test actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Facts have proven that as long as one masters Mao Zedong Thought, one can create any miracle! As for myself, it is also through studying Chairman Mao's works that I learned to do revolution. I come from a poor peasant family. Before liberation, my family was very poor, and two of my sisters were sold. It was Chairman Mao who liberated the whole nation and our family. I have boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, and my work enthusiasm is very high. However, my work was always not done well. Since I started studying Chairman Mao's works two years ago, I have come to understand how to serve the people.

In July of this year, our commune was hit by a major flood. The flood washed away a bridge, and a generator on the other side of the river was in danger of being submerged and washed away by the flood. At that time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching on serving the people wholeheartedly, and I jumped into the flood without hesitation. When the giant waves were about to sweep me away and my life was in danger, I thought of Chairman Mao's words: "Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Therefore, my body was filled with strength and courage again. In this way, I finally overcame the flood and saved the generator. I know that my work is still far from satisfactory. I should strive to learn from the participants of the nuclear test, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and achieve the goal of studying Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and serving the people for a lifetime.

This successful missile and nuclear weapon test is also a result of grasping the revolution and promoting production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great radiance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the field of scientific experiments. We should take the participants of the nuclear test as our examples, better grasp the revolution, promote production, strive for an even greater harvest next year, produce more grain, support national construction, and support the people of Vietnam and revolutionary people around the world. We congratulate the success of the missile and nuclear weapon test and are determined to create new achievements with practical actions to report to Chairman Mao.

    中国人民志气就是大
    中阿友好人民公社康营大队贫协副主席　芦志发
    我国发射导弹核武器试验的成功，是毛泽东思想又一伟大胜利。我作为一个转业军人，真有说不出来的激动。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，他们互相勾结，企图垄断核武器，企图用核武器来吓唬中国人民，吓唬全世界革命人民，这次导弹核武器试验成功，又给了他们迎头一棒，这真是大快人心！
    过去，帝国主义和修正主义者，说我们什么也不行，今天，我们要让他们来看一看，站起来了的中国人民到底行不行。铁的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是伟大的人民。我们有志气，有智慧，有力量。我们依靠自力更生，奋发图强的精神，一次又一次的创造了震动世界的奇迹。
    我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的伟大胜利，再一次显示出毛泽东思想的威力。这是参加核试验的解放军指战员、工人和科学技术人员活学活用毛主席著作的结果。事实证明，人们只要掌握了毛泽东思想，什么奇迹也能创造出来！说到我自己，也是靠学习毛主席著作才学会干革命的。我出身于一个贫农家庭，解放前，家里很穷，两个妹妹都被卖掉了。是毛主席让全国人民和我们一家翻了身。我对党和毛主席无限热爱，工作热情很高，但是，工作总是做不好。从前年学习毛主席著作以来，我才懂得应该怎样为人民服务。
    今年七月，我们社发大水，洪水把一座桥冲垮了，河的对面一台发电机，有被洪水淹没和冲走的危险，当时，我想起了毛主席关于完全、彻底为人民服务的教导，就不顾一切跳入了洪水。当巨浪快要把我卷走，生命受到威胁时，我又想起了毛主席的话：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”因此，浑身又充满了力量和勇气。就这样，终于战胜了洪水，救出了那台发电机。我知道，我的工作还做得很不够，我应该努力向核试验的参加者学习，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，做到读一辈子毛主席的书，一辈子为人民服务。
    这次导弹核武器试验成功，也是在无产阶级文化大革命中抓革命促生产的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命在科学实验方面焕发出来的巨大光辉。我们要以参加核试验的人员为榜样，更好地抓革命，促生产，争取明年更大丰收，多打粮食，支援国家建设，支援越南人民和世界革命人民。我们祝贺导弹核武器试验成功，决心以实际行动创造新成绩向毛主席汇报。
