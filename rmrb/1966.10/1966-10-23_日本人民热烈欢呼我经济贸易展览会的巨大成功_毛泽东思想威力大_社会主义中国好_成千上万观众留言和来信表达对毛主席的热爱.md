	Japanese people warmly celebrate the great success of our economic and trade exhibition. The power of Mao Zedong Thought is immense; socialist China is great. Tens of thousands of viewers and letters express their love for Chairman Mao.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd: Tokyo news: The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Kitakyushu, Japan, successfully concluded on the 21st. The broad masses of Japanese viewers enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the 700 million Chinese people in socialist construction and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Since its opening on October 1st, the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition has received over 1.5 million visitors, making it the largest number of visitors for a single-country international exhibition in Japan.

	The broad masses of Japanese viewers expressed their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and their boundless admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in tens of thousands of messages and letters. A young man from Yamaguchi Prefecture said: "I visited the exhibition twice and truly saw the face of the socialist China we have long yearned for. Mao Zedong Thought guarantees that the 700 million Chinese people advance towards a common goal. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, any arduous task can be accomplished." A viewer named Tanaka Noboru said: "I deeply feel that the great Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese people but also guides the revolutionary people of the world." Another viewer said: "I can only say one sentence: 'Socialist China is great,' because China is a great country built under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao. Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Many viewers respectfully praised Mao Zedong Thought for deeply entering the hearts of the 700 million Chinese people and becoming a great material force. A viewer named Goto Taiji said: "The great development of socialist China in heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, and culture is achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

	In the cultural hall of the Chinese exhibition, many photographs and books introducing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution attracted great attention from the viewers. Many people enthusiastically praised this unprecedented great revolution in human history. Sakai Katsuyoshi of the Hyogo branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association said that daring to carry out this revolution is the question of daring to carry the proletarian revolution to the end. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely carried out this revolution, which greatly inspired the revolution of the whole world. A viewer from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Kuraoka Tatsuo, said that the young people of Yamaguchi Prefecture express their respect for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution carried out by China. We should learn from the spirit of daring to revolution of the Chinese people.

	The Chinese color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" was screened in the cinema of the exhibition, receiving a warm welcome from the viewers. Every day, two screenings were fully booked, and some viewers were so moved that they couldn't help but shed tears. They said: "We, like the Red Guards of China, trust the great Chairman Mao." "Seeing Chairman Mao with a ruddy complexion and a strong body, we are genuinely happy from the bottom of our hearts."

	The success of the exhibition was achieved with the support of the broad Japanese friends who truly hope for Sino-Japanese friendship and through their resolute struggle against a handful of elements that oppose and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship. During the preparation stage of the exhibition, friends from the All-Japan Committee for the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, the West Japan Committee, and the Fukuoka Prefectural Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association discovered that there were a handful of malicious elements within, who, under the banner of "Sino-Japanese friendship," actually engaged in activities to sabotage the exhibition. With the support of the broad masses, they resolutely expelled these saboteurs from the leadership of these organizations and held high the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship. When the revolutionary masses of Yamaguchi Prefecture heard that a handful of malicious saboteurs were planning to cause trouble and sabotage the exhibition site, they sent over fifty young people who braved the rain and rode motorcycles to guard the venue, forcing these saboteurs to dare not act. These young people from Yamaguchi Prefecture were praised as "Japan's Red Guards."

	The success of the exhibition dealt a heavy blow to all anti-China forces, proving that the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, which has grown and strengthened in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is unbreakable by any force.

	The broad masses of Japanese people warmly celebrate the great success of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition. On the day of the exhibition's closing, the exhibition received more than eighty telegrams of congratulations from all over Japan, praising the Chinese exhibition for adding a glorious page to the history of Sino-Japanese friendship.

	At the closing ceremony of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Kitakyushu, Japan, the hosts and guests raised their arms and shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

    日本人民热烈欢呼我经济贸易展览会的巨大成功
    毛泽东思想威力大　社会主义中国好
    成千上万观众留言和来信表达对毛主席的热爱
    据新华社二十二日讯  东京消息：在日本北九州市举行的中国经济贸易展览会，二十一日胜利闭幕。广大日本观众热烈称赞七亿中国人民在社会主义建设事业和无产阶级文化大革命中取得的辉煌成就是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。中国经济贸易展览会从十月一日开幕以来，共接待了一百五十多万观众。这是一个国家单独在日本举行国际性展览会观众最多的一次。
    广大日本观众在成千上万篇的留言和来信中，表达了他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限敬仰。一位山口县的青年说：“我来展览会参观了两次，真正地看见了我们一直向往着的社会主义中国的面貌。毛泽东思想保障七亿中国人民朝着一个共同目标前进。毛泽东思想是最伟大的。在毛泽东思想指导下，任何艰巨的事业都是可以成功的。”一位名叫田中信的观众说：我深切地体会到伟大的毛泽东思想不仅是指导中国人民的思想，而且是指导世界革命人民的思想。还有一位观众说：我只能讲一句话，就是：“社会主义中国好”，这是因为中国是在伟大的毛主席领导下建设起来的伟大国家。毛主席万万岁！
    许多观众敬佩地称赞毛泽东思想深入了七亿中国人民的心，并且正在变成巨大的物质力量。一位叫后藤泰二的观众说：“社会主义中国在重工业、轻工业、农业、文化各方面的巨大发展都是在当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想的指导下取得的。”
    在中国展览会的文化馆中展出的许多介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的照片和书籍等引起了观众的极大注意。很多人热情赞扬这场人类历史上空前伟大的革命。日中友好协会下关分会的相见佳孝说，敢不敢进行这场革命是敢不敢把无产阶级革命进行到底的问题。伟大的中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下，毅然决然地进行了这一革命，这给全世界的革命以极大的鼓舞。山口县的观众古屋达夫说，我们山口县青年对中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命表示敬意。我们应当学习中国人民的敢于革命的精神。
      中国彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》在展览会的电影馆内放映，受到观众的热烈欢迎。每天放映两场，场场满座，有的观众感动得禁不住流下了热泪。他们说：“我们和中国的红卫兵一样信赖伟大的毛主席。”“看见毛主席满面红光，身体很结实，我们从心眼里感到高兴。”
    中国展览会的成功是在真正期望日中友好的广大日本朋友支持下，并且通过他们与一小撮反对和破坏日中友好的分子进行坚决斗争而取得的。在展览会的筹备阶段，中国经济贸易展览会日本全国协力会、西日本协力会、日中友好协会福冈县联合会的朋友，当发现内部有一小撮别有用心的分子打着“日中友好”招牌，实际上进行破坏展览会的活动时，他们在广大群众支持下，毅然把这些破坏分子从这些组织的领导机构中清除出去，高高举起日中友好的大旗。山口县革命群众在听到一小撮别有用心的破坏分子要在展览会场内进行捣乱和破坏时，派来五十多名青年冒着大雨骑着摩托车等，急驰赶来保卫会场，迫使这一小撮破坏分子未敢妄动。这些山口县青年被人们誉为“日本的红卫兵”。
    展览会的成功，给一切反华势力以沉重的打击，它证明在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中发展和壮大起来的日中两国人民的战斗友谊是任何势力也破坏不了的。
    广大日本人民热烈欢呼中国经济贸易展览会的巨大成功。在展览会闭幕当天，展览会收到了来自日本全国各地的八十多封贺电，赞扬中国展览会在日中友好史上，增添了光辉的一页。（附图片）
