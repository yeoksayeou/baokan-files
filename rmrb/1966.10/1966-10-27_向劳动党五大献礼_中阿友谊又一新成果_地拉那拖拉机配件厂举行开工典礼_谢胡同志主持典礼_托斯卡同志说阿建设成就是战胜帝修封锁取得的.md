The Tirana Tractor Parts Factory held its groundbreaking ceremony. Comrade Xiehu presided over the ceremony. Comrade Toska said that Albania's construction achievements are the result of overcoming imperialist and revisionist blockades.

New China News Agency, Tirana, October 25th - The newly built Tirana Tractor Parts Factory held a grand groundbreaking ceremony on October 24th. This factory is a gift from the Albanian working class to the Party on the eve of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party. It is also a symbol of the friendship between China and Albania.

Comrade Muhammad Xiehu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, personally cut the ribbon at the groundbreaking ceremony.

On this day, the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory presented a festive scene: magnificent factory buildings were adorned with red banners reading "Long live the Party of Labor of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha!", "Long live the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong!", "Long live the unbreakable friendship between Albania and China!" Red flags fluttered everywhere. Workers, as well as members of nearby agricultural cooperatives and students, gathered in the square.

Those present included: Comrade Ha Toska, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers; Comrade S. Kolega, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Chairman of the State Planning Commission; Comrade M. Muftiu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and First Secretary of the Tirana Municipal Committee; and Comrade K. Theodhori, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Minister of Industry and Mining.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Wang Jinchuan, was also invited to attend the groundbreaking ceremony.

At the mass rally during the groundbreaking ceremony, Toska said that Albania's achievements in socialist construction have been made in the midst of sharp struggles against domestic and foreign class enemies and in uncompromising struggles against imperialism led by American imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party. The modern revisionists, together with the imperialists, have attempted to conquer us. When they calculated that our economy would decline and the Albanian people would kneel, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people across the country erupted like a volcano. Under the leadership of the Party of Labor, the Albanian people, undeterred by the blockade and conspiracies of imperialism and modern revisionism, marched forward bravely and, in a short period, established one magnificent factory after another across the motherland.

Toska went on to say that in the glorious struggle for socialist construction, Albania has received the support of the great people of China and all the people of the world who love freedom. We have eternal internationalist ties with the People's Republic of China. The friendship between the peoples of China and Albania has been tempered in the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

Toska said that the cooperation and aid provided by the People's Republic of China for our socialist construction are extremely precious. The factory whose groundbreaking ceremony is being held today is a result of this aid. Toska expressed gratitude to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Toska concluded by saying that the upcoming Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania and the 25th anniversary of the Party's founding are the most significant historical events in our country today. The Fifth Congress will determine the path for further development of our socialist construction and our great tasks ahead.

Wang Jinchuan, in his speech, warmly praised the Albanian people for their high spirit of self-reliance and hard work under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, head of the Party of Labor of Albania. They have thoroughly shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions of blocking and strangling Albania, achieving brilliant successes in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Wang Jinchuan expressed his belief that the convening of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania will further inspire the Albanian people to display their unceasing revolutionary spirit and achieve even more inspiring new victories in all fronts of the great socialist cause.

Wang Jinchuan said that the construction and operation of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory are the result of the selfless labor of Albanian socialist builders under the leadership of the Party and the government, and at the same time, a crystallization of Sino-Albanian friendship. Chinese experts armed with Mao Zedong Thought are willing to contribute all their strength to the fraternal Albanian people and feel honored to do so.

The speeches of Toska and Wang Jinchuan were repeatedly interrupted by slogans such as "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Long live Albanian-Chinese friendship!" and by warm applause.

After Comrade Xiehu cut the ribbon, he visited the factory with representatives from various sectors.

The Tirana Tractor Parts Factory is one of the largest construction projects of Albania's Third Five-Year Plan, started in July 1963. This factory can produce 416 types of tractor parts, which will play a significant role in promoting the mechanization of Albania's agriculture.

    向劳动党五大献礼　中阿友谊又一新成果
    地拉那拖拉机配件厂举行开工典礼
    谢胡同志主持典礼　托斯卡同志说阿建设成就是战胜帝修封锁取得的
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚新建的地拉那拖拉机配件厂二十四日隆重举行开工典礼。这座工厂是阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和劳动党成立二十五周年前夕，向党的又一献礼，也是中阿友谊的又一象征。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志亲自在开工典礼上剪了彩。
    这一天，地拉那拖拉机配件厂呈现一片节日景象：宏伟的厂房上高悬着“以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！”、“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！”、“牢不可破的阿中友谊万岁！”等红色横幅标语，红旗到处飘扬。工人们以及附近的农业合作社社员和学生聚集在广场上。
    参加开工典礼的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席哈·托斯卡，劳动党中央政治局委员、国家计划委员会主任斯·科列加，劳动党中央政治局委员、地拉那市委员会第一书记马·穆夫蒂乌和劳动党中央政治局候补委员、工业和矿业部长科·蒂奥多西等。
    中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川也应邀参加了开工典礼。
    托斯卡在开工典礼的群众大会上发表讲话说，阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设道路上所取得的成就，是在同国内外阶级敌人的尖锐斗争中，在同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义进行的不妥协的斗争中取得的。现代修正主义者同帝国主义者一起妄图征服我们。当他们盘算着我国经济将要下降和阿尔巴尼亚人民将要屈膝的时候，我国各地劳动人民的革命热情像火山一样爆发了。在劳动党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民，不顾帝国主义和现代修正主义的封锁和阴谋，勇往直前，在很短的时期内在祖国各地建立起一个又一个宏伟的工厂。
    托斯卡接着说，阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义建设的光荣斗争中，得到了伟大的人民中国和全世界爱好自由人民的支持。我们同中华人民共和国有着永恒的国际主义的联系。阿中两国人民的友谊是在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争中锤炼起来的。
    托斯卡说，中华人民共和国对我国社会主义建设的合作和援助是非常珍贵的。今天举行开工典礼的这座工厂正是这一援助的成果。托斯卡向中国人民、中国共产党、中国政府和毛泽东同志表示感谢。
    托斯卡最后说，即将到来的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和劳动党成立二十五周年，是当今我国最重大的历史事件。第五次代表大会将确定我国社会主义建设进一步发展的道路和我们今后的伟大任务。
    王锦川在讲话中热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党英明领导下，高度发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义企图封锁和扼杀阿尔巴尼亚的痴心妄想，在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌成就。
    王锦川表示深信，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的召开，必将使阿尔巴尼亚人民进一步发挥不断革命的精神，在伟大的社会主义事业的各个战线上，取得更加鼓舞人心的新胜利。
    王锦川说，地拉那拖拉机配件厂的建成和开工是阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设者在党和政府领导下忘我劳动的结果，同时也是中阿友谊的结晶。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家愿为兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民贡献自己的全部力量，并以此感到光荣。
    托斯卡和王锦川的讲话不断被“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“阿中友好万岁！”等口号声和热烈的掌声打断。
    谢胡同志剪彩后，同各界代表一起参观了工厂。
    地拉那拖拉机配件厂是阿尔巴尼亚第三个五年计划的最大建设项目之一，是在一九六三年七月开始动工兴建的。这座工厂可以生产四百一十六种拖拉机配件，对促进阿尔巴尼亚农业机械化将起重大作用。（附图片）
