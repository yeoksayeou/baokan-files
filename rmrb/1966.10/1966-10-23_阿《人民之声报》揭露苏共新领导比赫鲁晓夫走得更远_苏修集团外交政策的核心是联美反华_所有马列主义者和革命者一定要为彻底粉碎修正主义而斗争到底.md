The editorial board of the Albanian "People's Voice" published an article on the 16th, pointing out that the new leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has gone further and more thoroughly down the counter-revolutionary path of betrayal than Khrushchev.

The article states that the new CPSU leadership has surpassed Khrushchev, who was ousted two years ago. They are sparing no effort to further split the international communist movement. They organized the 1965 March Moscow split meeting. They have completely rehabilitated the Tito clique, aligning themselves completely with them in thought and politics. They support all Trotskyites, opportunists, traitors, and splitters within and outside the communist parties of various countries, while maintaining a hostile policy of great-power chauvinism towards socialist Albania and the Albanian Party of Labour, as Khrushchev did. The article emphasizes that the most outrageous thing is that the Khrushchev revisionists have launched an anti-China movement, forming a united front with American imperialists and reactionaries of various countries, attempting to slander and defame the deeply significant revolutionary policies of great People's China, and joining with American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to form an encirclement against China. Today, the anti-China line and anti-China activities are the most important components of the foreign policy of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The article points out that the new CPSU leadership is implementing a line of completely restoring capitalism domestically and a line of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world internationally.

When discussing the Vietnam issue, the article says that the Khrushchev revisionists and American aggressors are in cahoots, opposing the just cause of the Vietnamese people, and trying every means to rescue American imperialism from complete failure, betraying the Vietnamese people. The Soviet revisionists are the trumpeters of the American "peace talks" hoax. They deceive people by advocating "joint action," aiming to bring the Vietnam issue into the track of Soviet-American cooperation, making Vietnam completely submit to American imperialism, and turning Vietnam into another base of aggression against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries in Asia.

The article states that the task of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries is to resolutely carry out the struggle to expose and completely isolate modern revisionism, achieving a thorough ideological and political victory in smashing it.

    阿《人民之声报》揭露苏共新领导比赫鲁晓夫走得更远
    苏修集团外交政策的核心是联美反华
    所有马列主义者和革命者一定要为彻底粉碎修正主义而斗争到底
    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十六日发表编辑部文章指出，苏共新领导在反革命叛徒的道路上比赫鲁晓夫走得更远、更彻底。
    文章说，苏共新领导超过了两年前下台的赫鲁晓夫本人，他们竭尽全力地进行活动，进一步分裂国际共产主义运动。他们组织了一九六五年三月莫斯科分裂会议。他们为铁托集团彻底翻案，在思想上和政治上与铁托集团完全同流合污。他们不惜一切支持各国共产党内外的所有托洛茨基分子、机会主义者、叛徒和分裂主义者，而对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，却顽固地奉行赫鲁晓夫的大国沙文主义的敌视政策。文章强调指出，最疯狂的是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者掀起了反华运动，同美帝国主义者和各国反动派结成了联合阵线，妄图诽谤和中伤伟大人民中国的具有深远意义的革命政策，并同美帝国主义和各国反动派一起组成反对中国的“包围圈”。今天，反华路线和反华活动是苏联修正主义领导集团对外政策的最主要的组成部分。
    文章指出，苏共新领导在国内正在实行完全恢复资本主义的路线，在国际上则推行苏美合作主宰世界的路线。
    文章在谈到越南问题的时候说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和美国侵略者穿着一条连裆裤，反对越南人民的正义事业，千方百计地企图把美帝国主义从彻底失败中挽救出来，出卖越南人民。苏联修正主义者是美国“和谈”骗局的吹鼓手。他们蛊惑人心地叫嚷“联合行动”，其目的就是把越南问题纳入苏美合作的轨道，使越南完全屈服于美帝国主义，变越南为反对中华人民共和国和亚洲其他爱好和平国家的另一个侵略基地。
    文章说，所有的马克思列宁主义者和革命者的任务，就是把揭露和完全孤立现代修正主义、争取从思想上和政治上彻底粉碎它的坚决斗争胜利地进行到底。
