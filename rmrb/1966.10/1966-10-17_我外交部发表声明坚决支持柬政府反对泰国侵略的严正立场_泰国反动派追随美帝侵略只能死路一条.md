The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on October 16, firmly supporting the Cambodian government's principled stance against Thai aggression. The Thai reactionaries, following the U.S. imperialists' aggression, are doomed to failure.

	New China News Agency, October 16th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China issued a statement on October 16th regarding the provocative incident where the Thai armed forces illegally entered Cambodia's Battambang Province to lay mines, resulting in casualties among Cambodian soldiers. The statement expresses that the Chinese government and people fully endorse the principled stance articulated by the Royal Government of Cambodia in its October 6th statement. China firmly supports the Cambodian people's just struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

	The full text of the statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China is as follows:

	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
	October 16, 1966

	On October 6th, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement, angrily condemning the provocative incident where the Thai armed forces illegally entered Cambodia's Battambang Province to lay mines, resulting in casualties among Cambodian soldiers. The statement also called on peace-loving and justice-seeking countries to pay attention to the serious situation caused by the Thai authorities on the Cambodian-Thai border. The Chinese government and people fully endorse the principled stance of the Cambodian government and firmly support the Cambodian people's just struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

	The Thai authorities have consistently acted as lackeys for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Indochina. With the "gradual escalation" of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, Thailand has become a military base for U.S. imperialism to expand the war. Thailand has openly dispatched invasion forces to South Vietnam and allowed U.S. planes to take off from Thai territory to bomb the people of Vietnam and Laos. At a time when the U.S. and its South Vietnamese puppets are intensifying military threats against Cambodia, the Thai reactionaries are actively collaborating on the Cambodian-Thai border, continuously conducting armed invasions and provocations. This further exposes the Thai authorities' expansionist ambitions to profit from U.S. military adventures.

	It must be warned to the Thai authorities that U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and Indochina is bound to fail. Chairman Mao Zedong has long pointed out: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The Thai reactionaries, following the U.S. imperialists' aggressive policies, tying their fate to U.S. imperialism, can only meet a dead end and will not have a good outcome.

	According to a report by the New China News Agency in Phnom Penh, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on October 6th, angrily condemning the criminal acts of Thai warmongers on the Cambodian-Thai border.

	The statement said that the Thai armed forces laid mines in Cambodia's Battambang Province, killing and injuring five Cambodian soldiers on September 18th.

	The statement said: "The Royal Government of Cambodia most strongly condemns the Thai warmongers for committing this new crime after a series of terrorist acts of provocation, invasion, or sabotage almost every day against neutral and peaceful Cambodia."

	The statement said: "The Royal Government calls on all peace-loving and justice-seeking countries to pay attention to the extremely serious situation caused by the Thai warmongers' and expansionist policies on the Cambodian-Thai border, which threatens peace in this region of Southeast Asia."

	According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency, on September 28th, a group of armed men from Thailand attacked a sentry post about six kilometers inside Battambang Province from the border with mortars. The Cambodian military counterattacked, forcing the invaders to retreat back into Thai territory.

    我外交部发表声明坚决支持柬政府反对泰国侵略的严正立场
    泰国反动派追随美帝侵略只能死路一条
    新华社十六日讯　中国外交部十六日就泰国武装部队非法侵入柬埔寨马德望省埋设地雷，造成柬埔寨士兵伤亡的挑衅事件发表声明，表示中国政府和中国人民完全赞同柬埔寨王国政府在十月六日的声明中所阐明的严正立场，坚决支持柬埔寨人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的正义斗争。中国外交部的声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                一九六六年十月十六日
    十月六日，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，愤怒谴责泰国武装部队非法侵入柬埔寨马德望省埋设地雷，造成柬埔寨士兵伤亡的挑衅事件，并且要求爱好和平和主持正义的国家注意泰国当局在柬泰边境造成的严重局势。中国政府和中国人民完全赞同柬埔寨政府的严正立场，坚决支持柬埔寨人民捍卫国家主权和领土完整的正义斗争。
    泰国当局一贯甘心充当美帝国主义侵略印度支那的走卒。随着美国侵略越南战争的“逐步升级”，泰国本土已经成为美帝国主义扩大战争的军事基地。泰国公开向南越派遣了侵略部队，并且允许美国飞机在泰国本土起飞，轰炸越南和老挝人民。在美国及其南越走狗加紧对柬埔寨进行军事威胁的时候，泰国反动派又在柬泰边境积极配合，不断进行武装入侵和挑衅。这就更加暴露了泰国当局企图在美国军事冒险中捞一把的扩张野心。
    必须正告泰国当局，美帝国主义对越南和印度支那的侵略是一定要失败的。毛泽东主席早就指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”泰国反动派追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，把自己的命运同美帝国主义联结在一起，也只能是死路一条，绝不会有什么好下场。
    据新华社金边电　据柬埔寨新闻社七日报道，柬埔寨王国政府六日发表声明，愤怒谴责泰国好战分子在柬泰边界进行挑衅的罪行。
    声明说，泰国武装部队在柬埔寨领土马德望省埋设地雷，九月十八日炸死、炸伤五名柬埔寨士兵。
    声明说：“柬埔寨王国政府最愤怒地谴责泰国好战分子在几乎每天都进行挑衅、侵略或破坏等一系列恐怖行动后又制造这一新罪行，以反对中立和和平的柬埔寨。”
    声明说：“王国政府提请所有爱好和平和伸张正义的国家注意泰国好战和扩张主义政策在柬泰边界所造成的极为严重的局势，这种局势威胁着东南亚这一地区的和平。”
    据柬埔寨新闻社报道，九月二十八日，一群来自泰国的武装分子用迫击炮袭击马德望省内距边境约六公里地方的一个哨所。柬埔寨军队进行了反击，迫使侵略者退回泰国境内。
