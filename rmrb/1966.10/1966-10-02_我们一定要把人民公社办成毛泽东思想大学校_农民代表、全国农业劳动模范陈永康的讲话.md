	We must turn the people's communes into schools of Mao Zedong Thought
	Speech by Chen Yongkang, a peasant representative and national model worker in agriculture

	Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: In his speech at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yongkang, a peasant representative and national model worker in agriculture, said:

	Our most beloved Chairman Mao, dear comrades, and friends:

	On the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I, on behalf of all peasant brothers and sisters across the country, extend my warmest greetings to our great leader Chairman Mao! I wish Chairman Mao eternal health!

	This year marks the first year of our country's third five-year plan for socialist construction. Under the impetus of the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the national industrial and agricultural production has shown a great leap forward. In the agricultural front, after four consecutive years of good harvests, this year is another bumper year. We are here to report this good news to Chairman Mao and to the people of the whole country!

	Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must turn all rural people's communes into schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

	We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, be self-reliant, and strive hard. We must seize the revolution and promote production to ensure a bumper harvest this year and next.

	We firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call and enthusiastically support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary young people, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Let the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries tremble before our victory!

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    在中华人民共和国成立十七周年的时候，我代表全国农民兄弟，向我们伟大领袖毛主席问好！祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    今年是我国社会主义建设第三个五年计划的第一年。在社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，全国的工农业生产出现了一个全面跃进的大好形势。在农业战线上，连续获得四年好收成之后，今年又是一个好年景。我们在这里向毛主席报喜，向全国人民报喜！
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。我们一定要响应林彪同志的号召，像解放军那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照着毛主席的指示办事，把所有的农村人民公社办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们要学习大寨的革命精神，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，抓革命，促生产，保证今年丰产丰收，保证明年再来一个丰收年。
    我们坚决响应毛主席的号召，热烈地支持革命青少年的革命行动，把无产阶级的文化大革命进行到底。
    让美帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派在我们胜利面前发抖吧！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
