Japanese friends recently visited Shaoshan, the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically praised, "Great Mao Zedong Thought is the common wealth of the world's proletariat, an ever-shining sun, and our guiding light, forever illuminating our path forward!"

Before heading to Shaoshan, the team leader, Honeo Waneichi, led all members to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheels of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will certainly achieve victory, whether sooner or later." After studying it three times, everyone got on the car, facing the vast, colorful sky, and headed towards the long-awaited Shaoshan.

Honeo Waneichi said, "Our purpose in visiting Shaoshan is to study Mao Zedong Thought." As soon as the Japanese friends arrived in Shaoshan, they held up the Chairman Mao quotations they brought high, forming a large banner: "Long Live Great Leader Chairman Mao!" Then they flipped the quotations over, all written neatly in Japanese and Chinese, these quotations were carefully selected by them based on Japan's current struggle situation and tasks.

In front of Chairman Mao's former residence, the Japanese friends sang "Navigating the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and shouted, "Long Live Great Leader Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" Workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards from all over the country who were visiting and studying in Shaoshan joined the Japanese friends in cheering and singing. The shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao" echoed through the skies, and the song "Navigating the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" resonated across the hills and fields.

During the visit to Chairman Mao's former residence and the exhibition hall, many Japanese friends were moved to tears. Some said, "Visiting Shaoshan not only deepened our understanding of the great leader Chairman Mao, but also our admiration for the family members of Chairman Mao who dedicated themselves to the cause of people's liberation." They said, "Chairman Mao is not only the beloved leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the people of the world!"

Japanese friends wrote down their feelings in the guestbook. Some wrote, "Visiting the former residence of the great leader Chairman Mao has further deepened our study of Chairman Mao's leadership in the socialist revolution. We are convinced that Mao Zedong Thought will give new strength to the world revolution." Some wrote that the severe revolutionary tests and hardships Chairman Mao experienced, "greatly inspired our revolutionary movement in Japan, I feel that Chairman Mao is by my side." Some wrote, "Visiting the great Chairman Mao's former residence in Shaoshan, my feelings are indescribable. I hereby declare: After returning home, I will resolutely fight against difficulties and struggle for the liberation of the people of the world to the end!"

Team leader Honeo Waneichi said upon leaving Shaoshan, "We must turn Mao Zedong Thought into our actual actions."

    高歌《大海航行靠舵手》　高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁”
    日本朋友带着毛主席语录牌访韶山
    代表团长说：“我们一定要把毛泽东思想变为自己的实际行动”
    新华社长沙十八日电　第四批日本社会党活动家代表团最近访问了伟大领袖毛主席的家乡韶山。他们热情地赞扬说：“伟大的毛泽东思想是世界无产阶级的共同财富，是永远不落的太阳，是我们心中的指路明灯，永远照耀着我们前进！”
    代表团在去韶山前，团长羽根荣一领着全体团员学习毛主席语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”学习三遍以后，大家才坐上汽车，迎着万里彩霞，奔赴向往已久的韶山。
    羽根荣一说：“我们访问韶山的目的，是学习毛泽东思想。”日本朋友一到韶山，就把携带的毛主席语录牌高高地举起来，组成了一幅大标语：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”接着又把语录牌翻过来，上面全是用日文和中文书写得十分工整的毛主席语录，这些语录都是他们自己针对日本当前的斗争形势和任务选出的。
    日本朋友在毛主席旧居门前，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”正在韶山参观学习的来自全国各地的工农兵群众、革命学生、革命干部和红卫兵，同日本朋友一齐欢呼，一同歌唱，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄，《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声震荡着山岗田野。
    在参观毛主席旧居和旧居陈列馆的时候，许多日本朋友都感动得热泪盈眶。有的人说：“参观韶山，不但加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的认识，同时对毛主席的家庭成员献身于人民解放事业深表钦佩。”他们说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民敬爱的领袖，而且是全世界人民的伟大领袖！”
    日本朋友在留言簿上激动地写下他们的感想。有的人写道：“访问了伟大领袖毛主席的旧居，进一步学习了毛主席领导社会主义革命的崇高精神。我们确信毛泽东思想必将给世界革命以新的力量。”有的人写道，毛主席经历过的严峻的革命考验和种种艰难困苦，“极大地鼓舞了我们日本的革命运动，我感到毛主席就在自己的身边。”有的人写道：“参观伟大的毛主席旧居韶山，我的心情是无法描写的，我在此宣誓：回国后坚决同困难作斗争，为世界人民的解放而奋斗到底！”
    团长羽根荣一在离开韶山时说：“我们一定要把毛泽东思想变为自己的实际行动。”
