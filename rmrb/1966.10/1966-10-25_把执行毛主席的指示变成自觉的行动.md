I cannot stay in the hospital for a single day, away from my combat post and my close comrades. To respond to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to find gas and oil, we oil workers eat poorly, sleep poorly, and fight against the heavens, the earth, and all difficulties! How can I lie in bed? My illness will be cured the moment I hear the drilling machine's sound.
		——Zhang Yongqing

We oil workers are the revolutionary backbone, unyielding under a thousand pounds of burden, and daring to carry ten thousand pounds! After hearing Chairman Mao's instructions, I can no longer sit still. We always say we follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. Now, Chairman Mao has personally given us instructions, and the Chinese people and the people of the world are expecting us. I don't care about anything else. I will risk my life to find the big oil fields, to boost the morale of oil workers, and to bring glory to the people of our country. Let the Party and Chairman Mao be at ease, let the Chinese people and the people of the world be at ease!

My life is given by the Party and the people. The Party and the people need me to work hard and sweat for finding gas and oil, and this is my greatest happiness! I am willing to give up everything, and even if I die, I will do so willingly!
		——Wang Ping

People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, the most obedient to the Party. The Party tells me to do what, I do what. I am willing to be a lifelong oil warrior for the revolution. For finding gas and oil, I will climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea.
		——Lu Huatai

We will strive to find oil and gas, even if it means dying on the battlefield. Every task I undertake, every small beneficial deed, is a concrete service to the people and a concrete execution of Chairman Mao's instructions.
		——Wang Zuming

A single tree cannot make a forest, a single drop cannot make a river. An individual's ability is limited, and to excel in completing tasks, one must unite and rely on the masses. In our ranks, there are advanced and backward elements, and among ten fingers, some are long and some are short. Therefore, everyone must care for each other and help each other ideologically. One person's success is only a small victory, but everyone's success is a great victory.

The locomotive at the front must pull many carriages. A squad leader must rally the entire squad and cannot dance alone.
		——Wang Youfa

A chief engineer once said: "A chief engineer is not someone who knows everything, understands everything, and is always right, but someone who aggregates the wisdom of the masses, the enthusiasm, and creativity of everyone."

This insight is very valuable. Any chief engineer or chief designer who truly wants to achieve this "aggregation" must prioritize politics, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow the mass line, and integrate with reality and the workers. Only in this way can one accelerate one's ideological transformation and forge oneself into a proletarian engineer.
		——Zhang Zhongmin

Now, imperialism and revisionism are strangling us. We must rely on our own efforts and strive hard. I am a soldier on the oil front. To oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, I will dedicate my life to the construction of the oil industry.
		——Lei Hongbin

I am a specific executor of the task to find gas and oil. Even if it means sacrificing everything, I will complete the mission. Even if it means sacrificing my life, I will find the oil and gas.
		——Xu Yongmao

As long as my heart beats for one minute, I will work for one minute for the cause of communism, work for one minute for the people's interests, until I stop breathing.

I resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to support our Vietnamese brothers. The disasters of the Vietnamese people are our disasters; the enemies of the Vietnamese people are our enemies. We must quickly seize the oil and gas fields and strive to eliminate American imperialism as soon as possible!
		——Huang Chenghou

    把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动
    离开自己的战斗岗位，离开亲密的战友，在医院我一天也住不下去。为了响应党中央、毛主席找气找油的指示，我们石油工人吃不香，睡不好，与天斗，与地斗，与一切困难斗！我怎么能躺在病床上？我的病一听到钻机响就会好的。
                              ——张永庆
    我们石油工人，是革命的硬骨头，千斤重担压不倒，万斤重担也敢挑！
    听了毛主席他老人家的指示，我再也坐不住了。我们天天说听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，现在毛主席亲自给我们作了指示，中国人民和世界人民都在期待着我们。我什么也不顾了，豁出命来，也得找出大油田来，给石油工人长志气，为祖国人民争光。让党和毛主席放心，让中国人民和世界人民放心！
    我这条命是党和人民给的，党和人民需要我为找气找油出力出汗，这是我最大的幸福！我什么都舍得，就是死了，也心甘情愿！
                                ——王平
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，最听党的话。党叫我干啥就干啥，我愿为革命当一辈子石油战士，为了找气找油，是刀山也要上，是火海也要闯。
                            ——罗华太
　  我们拚死拚活也要找出油和气来。为了找气找油，我死也要死在战斗的岗位上。
    我做每项工作，每一件有益的小事，都是具体的为人民服务，都是具体的执行毛主席指示。
                                ——王祖明
    独木不成林，滴水不成河，一个人的能力是有限的，要想出色地完成任务，必须团结和依靠群众。
    在我们队伍中有先进和后进，十个指头有长短，因此，要人人互相关心，从思想上互相帮助。一人红只能红一点，人人红才能红一片。
    火车头在前面跑，要挂上很多的车厢。当班长的要把全班带动起来，不能跳光杆舞。
                              ——王有发
    有一位总工程师曾经说过：“一个总工程师不是自己什么都‘总’会，‘总’懂，‘总’对，而应该‘总’群众的智慧，‘总’大家的积极性、创造性。”
    这一体会，十分可贵。任何一个总工程师、总设计师，要真正能做到这样的“总”，就必须政治挂帅，活学活用毛主席著作，必须走群众路线，必须与实际相结合，与工人打成一片。只有这样，才能加速自己的思想改造，把自己锻炼成为一个无产阶级的工程师。
                                ——张仲珉
    现在帝国主义和修正主义卡我们的脖子，我们要自力更生，艰苦奋斗。我是石油战线上的一个战士，为了反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，我要为石油工业建设献出我的一生。
                                ——雷洪炳
    我是找气找油任务的具体执行者。就是牺牲一切，也要完成任务。就是牺牲自己的生命，也要找出油和气来。
                            ——许永茂
    只要我的心脏还跳动一分钟，就要为共产主义事业劳动一分钟，为人民的利益工作一分钟，直到停止呼吸为止。
    我坚决响应毛主席的号召，支援越南兄弟。越南人民的灾难，就是我们的灾难；越南人民的敌人，就是我们的敌人。我们要尽快地拿下油气田，争取早日消灭美帝国主义！
                            ——黄成厚
