Hebei Province Sees Bountiful Cotton Harvest

According to Xinhua News Agency, from Baoding on the 15th, one of the major cotton-producing regions in northern China, Hebei Province, has seen another bumper cotton harvest this year. The cotton that has been picked so far is long-fibered and has few impurities. Many production teams have significantly increased their cotton yield per unit area compared to last year. This is another glorious victory achieved by the broad masses of Hebei Province in production through their active study and application of Chairman Mao's works.

Before and after sowing this year, the southern part of Hebei Province experienced severe drought, affecting cotton sowing. Faced with difficulties, the community members studied "Three Articles" and "Give Up Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and other articles, armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and displayed a brave and tenacious revolutionary spirit to fight against the drought. They built canals, dug wells, and opened mountains to find water sources, finally managing to sow the cotton.

This year, various places in Hebei Province planted cotton in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings: "Human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, and creations, and make progress." They dared to innovate, broke away from old ideas, old habits, and old frameworks, and promoted rational dense planting. In cotton field management, they adopted deep plowing and multiple fertilization methods. Many regions also dared to innovate and promoted the new technology of intercropping cotton and wheat, increasing both grain and cotton production. During the mid-growth period of cotton, many regions experienced severe pest infestations, and due to continuous rain, cotton growth faced great difficulties. In these circumstances, the broad masses of community members remained undaunted, using the method of concentrating forces to launch annihilation battles, bravely fighting against pests and rainy weather, and finally eliminating various cotton pests, ensuring the normal growth of cotton.

Currently, community members in the cotton-producing areas are carefully picking new cotton while selling the high-quality cotton they have picked to the state.

    河北棉花丰收
    据新华社保定十五日电　我国北方主要产棉区之一的河北省，今年棉花又获丰收。各地已采摘的棉花绒长、杂质少，不少社队棉花的单位面积产量比去年显著增加。这是河北省广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，在生产上获得的又一辉煌胜利。
    今年棉花播种前后，河北省南部严重干旱，影响棉花播种。在困难面前，社员们学习“老三篇”和《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，发扬了勇敢顽强的革命精神，向干旱开战。他们修渠挖井、开山凿泉，千方百计寻找水源，终于把棉花种上了。
    今年，河北各地种棉，还遵照毛主席“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，大胆革命，破除旧思想、旧习惯、旧框框，推行了合理密植，在棉田管理工作中采用了深中耕和多追肥等方法。有不少地区还大胆创造，推行了棉麦间作的新技术，既增产了粮食，又多种了棉花。棉花生长中期，很多地区发生了严重的虫害，又因为阴雨连绵，给棉花生长带来很大困难。在这种情况下，广大社员毫不气馁，采用集中力量打歼灭战的办法，勇敢地与虫害和阴雨天气作斗争，终于扑灭了各种棉花害虫，保证了棉花正常生长。
    目前，棉区社员，正在一边精细地采摘新棉，一边把摘下的优质棉花出售给国家。
