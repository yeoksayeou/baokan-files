Any person's class essence and political appearance are most clearly revealed in the critical moments of class struggle. Sharp class struggle forces people to reveal their true positions.

As long as one uses the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to carefully observe Zhou Yang's actions during the key moments of class struggle on the cultural and artistic front, one can see the true face of this counterrevolutionary revisionist.

I

After liberation, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led several major struggles on the cultural and artistic front.

In 1950, during the criticism of the film "Wu Xun," Chairman Mao not only criticized the extremely reactionary ideas promoted by the film but also sharply criticized the fact that many Party members in the cultural and artistic field had surrendered to bourgeois ideology and had abandoned the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies in the cultural and artistic domain. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Hasn't the reactionary bourgeois ideology infiltrated the fighting Communist Party? Isn't this a fact?"

In 1954, Chairman Mao led the criticism of "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" and the criticism of Hu Shi's reactionary ideology, opposing bourgeois idealism and opposing some bourgeois representatives within the Party who, as "authorities," monopolized culture and art, suppressing the new forces of Marxism.

In 1955, Chairman Mao led the struggle against the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, criticizing Hu Feng's reactionary bourgeois worldview and revisionist literary program, and further elucidating the issue of implementing proletarian dictatorship in the ideological domain by refuting Hu Feng's reactionary fallacy of "uniform public opinion."

In 1957, Chairman Mao published two brilliant works: "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological domain in our country will take a considerable length of time to resolve." He also personally led the struggle against the rightists.

These several major struggles on the cultural and artistic front were not just about a few individuals, a few books, or a few films. They were several major rounds of class struggle in the ideological domain. The central issue was to oppose bourgeois ideology with proletarian ideology and to oppose the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview.

Zhou Yang, this cunning and crafty revisionist who is good at waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, participated in several major struggles personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao on the surface. In reality, however, he tried his best to distort the meaning of the struggle, shift the target of the struggle, and play a counter-role to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The film "Wu Xun" was shot under Zhou Yang's direct support and was screened nationwide after his review. As soon as the film appeared, Chairman Mao immediately pointed out its reactionary nature and called for a nationwide discussion and criticism. Zhou Yang changed his stance immediately and threw out an article titled "Anti-People, Anti-History Thought and Anti-Realism Art," actually trying to evade his responsibility, saying, "I myself watched the film 'Wu Xun' quite early, but I did not fully recognize and point out its serious political reactionary nature in time." He lightly described it as: "This is related to the bureaucratic style in our literary and artistic leadership." He described this politically extremely reactionary film as "anti-realism art," using this to continue promoting his bourgeois "realism" goods, stubbornly opposing Chairman Mao's criticism.

In the criticism of "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" Zhou Yang not only did not oppose the shameful behavior of kneeling before bourgeois "authorities" but instead used this opportunity to praise "tradition" and "heritage," describing this struggle as a fight against "devaluing the objective value of 'Dream of the Red Chamber.'" Later, he boasted everywhere about the value of "Dream of the Red Chamber" being in "pursuing a more human-like true person," saying that Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu were such "more human-like" people, trying to peddle the bourgeois "humanism" goods. Moreover, as soon as the criticism ended, he gave speeches and wrote articles everywhere, praising bourgeois intellectuals and trying to fight for the position of bourgeois "authorities."

The struggle against Hu Feng was a direct strike at the heart of Zhou Yang's bourgeois reactionary worldview and literary view. Zhou Yang and Hu Feng were completely consistent in a series of fundamental views: both advocated "writing reality"; both advocated that people have so-called "spiritual slavery wounds"; both opposed writing "major themes"; both strongly opposed so-called "formulaic and conceptual" and "vulgar sociology." Therefore, although Zhou Yang and Hu Feng had frequent dog-fights in the past, in critical moments, he always tried to cover up for Hu Feng. In the early days of liberation, the Party Central Committee repeatedly instructed to criticize Hu Feng's reactionary ideology. Zhou Yang, however, pretended to obey but actually disobeyed, feigning attacks but actually protecting, showing the Party Central Committee's letter about how to criticize Hu Feng to Hu Feng. In the summary speech at the symposium on criticizing Hu Feng's literary thoughts in 1952, Zhou Yang said: "Hu Feng has indeed grasped the true weaknesses of our literary movement, which are formulaic and conceptual." He also said: "We are not saying that Hu Feng's political attitude is against Comrade Mao Zedong." After the struggle against Hu Feng achieved victory, he sometimes said: "The problem with Hu Feng is not that their literary thoughts and literary creation have contradictions with us, but that they organized secret organizations"; sometimes he brazenly attacked this great political struggle led by Chairman Mao, saying that this struggle was a purge, and the ideological problems were not solved. The bourgeois literary line that Zhou Yang promoted afterward was still the same as Hu Feng's.

In 1957, when the rightists launched an attack on the Party, Zhou Yang thought he had accumulated political capital in the past few struggles and became even more brazen, directly and blatantly attacking the Party. He personally took the stage, loudly shouting: "Has the Party led well? I think not. True leadership must be by experts," "scientists must lead science, artists must lead art, musicians must lead music." He distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously promoting bourgeois liberalization. Zhou Yang's confidant Zhong Diancui first, under the name of a critic for the "Literary Gazette," after Zhou Yang's review, beat the drums for "Film Drums." Tian Han proposed "A Plea for the Youth of Actors." Qiao Yuanlin set fires in Zhejiang and other places, inciting literary and artistic workers to attack local Party committees. Xia Yan also strongly attacked the Party's leadership. Zhou Yang and his gang were very cunning. Later, they found the situation unfavorable and changed their stance, temporarily restrained themselves, and slipped through. They were such a gang of big rightists who escaped the net.

For a long time, Zhou Yang covered up the true facts of these several major struggles in the literary and artistic circles. He wrote articles and gave reports, boasting greatly, trying to portray himself as "consistently correct." Until last year, at the National Conference of Active Young Amateur Literary Creation, he still shamelessly talked about the several major struggles in the literary and artistic circles since the founding of the nation, distorting the meaning of the struggle and whitewashing himself. However, lies can never cover up the truth. Now is the time to expose Zhou Yang's counterrevolutionary revisionist face and thoroughly criticize and settle accounts with him!

II

The bourgeoisie does not want to withdraw from the historical stage. The closer they are to their end, the more fiercely they struggle. Starting from the second half of 1960, our country's economy encountered some temporary difficulties, and internationally, a wave of anti-China chorus arose. Zhou Yang and his gang thought the time had come and launched another brazen attack on the Party and socialism, attempting to carry out a "great reversal" of capitalism in cities and rural areas.

In 1962, Zhou Yang, at the symposium on the creation of short stories with rural themes held in Dalian, fiercely attacked the Three Red Banners, slandering the Great Leap Forward as "subjective idealism," and the People's Communes as "established too early," vigorously advocating individual farming and responsibility to the household. He and Khrushchev were singing the same tune. At the same time, Zhou Yang and his gang threw out a thoroughly revisionist literary program centered on the theory of "national literature and art," intensively preparing spiritually for the counterrevolutionary restoration of capitalism. At that time, the cultural and artistic field was filled with monsters and ghosts occupying the stage, various weeds growing wildly, making it chaotic.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led another major struggle on the cultural and artistic front.

In 1963 and 1964, Chairman Mao made two instructions of great historical significance on literary and artistic work.

In December 1963, Chairman Mao pointed out: Various forms of art—drama, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, and there are many people. The socialist transformation in many departments has so far had very little effect.

In June 1964, at the rectification of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chairman Mao again pointed out: These associations and the majority of the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have basically (not everyone) not implemented the Party's policies for fifteen years, acted as officials and lords, not approached workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously rectified, they will inevitably become like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day. Chairman Mao's instructions deeply pointed out the essence of the struggle between the two lines on our literary and artistic front. Its target was directly aimed at the extremely serious situation under Zhou Yang's control in the literary and artistic circles.

However, Zhou Yang did not turn back. He exhausted his wits, playing trick after trick, trying his best to resist Chairman Mao's instructions, obstruct the proletarian cultural revolution, and attempt to continue to hold the fort and wait for an opportunity to counterattack.

First, he directly opposed Chairman Mao's instructions. From the beginning, he sealed them off and did not pass them down. When he could no longer seal them off and hide them, he sang the opposite tune, vigorously praising the "achievements" of cultural work over the past fifteen years. Chairman Mao pointed out that the literary and artistic circles had basically not implemented the Party's policies for fifteen years, but Zhou Yang said that the literary and artistic work since the founding of the nation had been "developing according to the Party's line," "do not settle old scores"; Chairman Mao pointed out that the socialist transformation in many departments had so far had very little effect, but Zhou Yang maliciously said "we cannot, because of the cultural revolution, regard the team as a black mass." In the summary of the rectification movement in the Ministry of Culture, he also maliciously planted a time bomb, saying, "What line errors are there? We need to discuss. If there are none, we will amend." He was prepared to reverse the case at any time to make everything vanish.

Second, he tried his best to protect his followers and attempted to slip through. After Chairman Mao's second instruction was issued, he personally directed his followers to make false self-criticisms, saying: "The situation has changed now, we cannot pass," "we can only save ourselves." "The Ministry of Culture only needs a good self-examination, and a few good films, a few good plays, a few good books can be made." "I am going to support you, if you do not take the initiative, the Propaganda Department as a backing is also unreliable." Later, he saw that Xia Yan could no longer be protected, so he proposed: "The problem in the Ministry of Culture is mainly in the film sector, and the problem in the film sector is mainly Xia Yan," preparing to "sacrifice the pawn to protect the king" to protect the overall situation. When other anti-Party leaders in the Ministry of Culture, such as Qi Yanming and Chen Huangmei, were one by one pulled out, Zhou Yang, on the one hand, pretended to "rectify" them a bit, secretly expressing his "difficulties" to them: "If I do not rectify you, I will make mistakes with you." On the other hand, he repeatedly encouraged other followers, saying: "The Central Committee sends people, they can only send one or two people," "we are not lone geese here, we are a flock of geese, and not small geese, we are a flock of old geese." Encouraging them to strive to continue to "lead work here." When the fake rectification in the Ministry of Culture ended, Zhou Yang wanted to pull Chen Huangmei, who had already decided to be transferred, back to the Ministry of Culture. He told Chen Huangmei: "You can go to the nearby area to carry out a few 'Four Clean-ups,' and then return to the literary and artistic circles!" Zhou Yang was like this, step by step, stubbornly holding onto his anti-Party position.

Third, he used every means to cover up for himself and tried his best to evade responsibility. In the fake rectification in the Ministry of Culture, in order to deceive the Central Committee, he strictly stipulated: All materials and documents issued by the Propaganda Department's meetings must not be printed and distributed; all materials exposed by the masses involving the Propaganda Department must not be included in the bulletin; in the printed materials, all places quoting Zhou Yang's speeches must be deleted. In order to deceive the masses, he also emphasized in large and small meetings, describing his problems as merely "being slow to realize and act on the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, having recognition problems, and also bureaucratism." He used all kinds of tricks and tried his best to quibble. For example, at the summary meeting of the rectification in the Ministry of Culture, he said: "Serving the bourgeoisie, in a certain sense, can also be said. Serving all strata, standing on the proletarian position, serving those in the bourgeoisie who are willing to accept proletarian ideology, not serving the bourgeoisie class." This is nonsense, and he cannot make himself sound reasonable. Everyone knows that using proletarian ideology to struggle against bourgeois ideology is to eliminate the bourgeoisie, and it is impossible to talk about "serving the bourgeoisie." Zhou Yang, this famous "authority," his "theory" turned out to be so clumsy!

Fourth, he suppressed the revolutionary leftists and repressed the mass movement. As soon as the fake rectification began, he declared: Some people "fear that the world is not chaotic," "the mass movement will cause problems," "when it reaches a certain point, attention must be paid to control." He claimed: "The rectification mainly relies on the bureau and division chiefs," stipulating not to post big-character posters, not to have big debates, and keeping the struggle within the small circle of a few people. For the criticism of Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Chen Huangmei, and others, Zhou Yang also emphasized "not to hold on," but to end it hastily. He also repeatedly emphasized that the criticism was "too harsh," "the scope of attack was too wide." In the end, he raised the banner of "rectification should be implemented in production," hastily ending this fake rectification.

After playing trick after trick, Zhou Yang was very pleased with himself, thinking that this time he had slipped through smoothly again and wanted to take the opportunity to gain new political capital. Therefore, he gave speeches everywhere, vigorously praising the "rectification" led by him as "the second great rectification movement after the Yan'an rectification movement," "in some sense, more profound than the criticism of the rightists and the criticism of Hu Feng." In the speech at the National Conference of Active Young Amateur Literary Creation, he again distorted Chairman Mao's instructions, vigorously praising his own "merits" in the cultural revolution; then he quickly published this speech, printing more than 300,000 copies, wanting to elevate himself to a higher position.

Zhou Yang never gave up. As soon as the fake rectification ended, he launched a new offensive. At the symposium on the performance of plays and operas in the North China region, he loudly advocated "daring to innovate," "daring to write contradictions," and "daring to express different opinions." These three "dares" were Zhou Yang's reactionary proposals. The so-called "daring to innovate" was his consistent advocacy of "deviating from the orthodox path"! The so-called "daring to write contradictions" was his consistent advocacy of "writing reality," writing the "dark side" of socialist society! The so-called "daring to express different opinions" was encouraging people to rise up against the Party's leadership. In this speech, Zhou Yang, with a guilty conscience, said: "The most feared thing is to immediately label someone with a counterrevolutionary, anti-socialist, and bourgeois hat as soon as they open their mouth." This was a self-exposure, and this time, it more clearly exposed his stubborn insistence on counterrevolutionary and anti-socialist, attempting to carry out the restoration of capitalism. The end of this number one agent of the bourgeoisie in the literary and artistic circles was approaching.

III

Zhou Yang was very familiar with the strategies of the bourgeoisie in class struggle. He had one set of words on the surface and another set in secret; he followed the wind and took advantage of opportunities. When the bourgeoisie launched an attack on the proletariat, he intensified his behind-the-scenes activities, actively cooperated, fanned the flames, and spread poison. When the proletariat launched a counterattack on the bourgeoisie, he found a color to cover himself, disguised himself as the Party's spokesman, shifted the target of the struggle, and gained political capital. Until the fire of struggle approached him and his end was near, he would adopt the strategy of "attacking to defend" and struggle desperately.

Chairman Mao taught us: The overthrown exploiting classes, "they have long-term experience in class struggle, they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal and illegal. We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, must study their strategies, so as to defeat them. We must not be too bookish and simplify the complex class struggle."

Chairman Mao's teaching is of great significance for us to understand the class struggle under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and to recognize the true face of the counterrevolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang.

We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching, thoroughly fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to stink this small group of capitalist-roaders in power! Make sure they never rise again!

    周扬在阶级斗争中的反革命真面目
    东锋
    任何人，他的阶级本质和政治面貌，无不在阶级斗争的严重时刻，最清楚地显露出来。尖锐的阶级斗争，迫使人们不能不表明自己真正的立场。
    只要用毛泽东思想的照妖镜，认真观察一下周扬在文化艺术战线上阶级斗争各个关键时刻的所作所为，就可以看清这个反革命修正主义分子的真面目。
    一
    解放以后，毛主席亲自发动和领导了文化艺术战线上多次重大斗争。
    在一九五○年批判电影《武训传》的斗争中，毛主席不仅批判了这部影片所宣扬的极端反动的思想，并且尖锐地批评当时许多党员文化艺术工作者向资产阶级思想投降、在文化艺术领域内放弃无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想斗争的严重事实。毛主席指出：“资产阶级的反动思想侵入了战斗的共产党，这难道不是事实吗？”
    一九五四年，毛主席领导了批判《红楼梦研究》、批判胡适反动思想的斗争，反对了资产阶级唯心主义，反对了党内一些资产阶级代表人物以“权威”自居，垄断文化艺术，压制马克思主义的新生力量。
    一九五五年，毛主席领导了反对胡风反革命集团的斗争，批判了胡风反动的资产阶级世界观和修正主义的文艺纲领，并且通过驳斥胡风“舆论一律”的反动谬论，进一步阐明了在意识形态领域内实行无产阶级专政的问题。
    一九五七年，毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》两篇光辉的著作。毛主席明确指出：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”并且又亲自领导了反右派的斗争。
    文艺战线上这几次重大的斗争，决不只是针对几个人、几本书、几部电影的问题，而是意识形态领域里阶级斗争的几个重大回合，它的中心问题，就是以无产阶级思想反对资产阶级思想，以无产阶级世界观反对资产阶级世界观。
    周扬这个善于打着“红旗”反红旗的老奸巨猾的修正主义分子，表面上参加了毛主席亲自领导和发动的多次重大斗争，实际上，却竭力歪曲斗争的意义，转移斗争的目标，同党中央和毛主席唱对台戏。
    电影《武训传》是在周扬直接支持下拍摄并经他审查后在全国放映的。影片一出现，毛主席立即指出它的反动性，号召全国人民展开讨论批判。周扬看风转舵，立即抛出一篇样子很凶的文章《反人民、反历史的思想和反现实主义的艺术》，实际上，却是为他的罪责开脱，说什么“我自己很早就看了电影《武训传》，但并没有能够充分地认识和及早地指出它的严重的政治上的反动性。”他轻描淡写地说：这“和我们文艺工作的领导上所存在的事务主义的作风有关系”。他把这部政治上极为反动的影片说成是“反现实主义的艺术”，借此继续宣扬他那套资产阶级的“现实主义”黑货，顽强地和毛主席的批评相对抗。
    在《红楼梦研究》的批判中，周扬不但不反对那种拜倒在资产阶级“权威”面前的可耻行为，相反，他借此大吹大捧“传统”和“遗产”，把这场斗争说成是为了反对“贬低《红楼梦》的客观价值。”以后，他又到处吹嘘《红楼梦》的价值就在于“追求一种比较有人性的真人”，说贾宝玉、林黛玉就是这种“比较有人性”的人，竭力兜售资产阶级“人性论”的黑货。而且，批判刚结束，他就到处作演讲，写文章，吹捧资产阶级知识分子，竭力为资产阶级“权威”争地位。
    反胡风斗争，更是直接刺到周扬资产阶级反动世界观和文艺观的深处。周扬和胡风在一系列根本观点上是完全一致的：同样鼓吹“写真实”；同样主张人民身上有所谓“精神奴役的创伤”；同样反对写“重大题材”；同样竭力反对所谓“公式化、概念化”和“庸俗社会学”。因此，尽管周扬和胡风过去不断有些狗咬狗似的争吵。但是，在紧要关头，他总是极力包庇胡风的。解放初期，党中央一再指示要对胡风的反动思想进行批判。周扬却阳奉阴违，假打真拉，把党中央给他的关于如何批判胡风的信件拿给胡风看。在一九五二年批判胡风文艺思想座谈会的总结发言中，周扬说：“胡风一向的确抓到了我们文艺运动中的真正的弱点，就是公式化概念化。”又说：我们“并不是说胡风在政治态度上就是反对毛泽东同志的。”在反胡风斗争取得胜利以后，他一忽儿说：胡风的“问题不在于他们的文艺思想和文艺创作同我们有矛盾，而在于他们搞秘密组织”；一忽儿又对毛主席亲自领导的这场伟大的政治斗争放肆地进行攻击，说什么这次斗争搞了个肃反，思想问题都没有解决。而周扬以后推行的，仍然还是和胡风同样的一条资产阶级文艺路线。
    在一九五七年右派向党发起进攻的时候，周扬自以为已经有了在过去几次斗争中所捞下的政治资本，就变本加厉，更直接更露骨地向党进攻。他亲自出马，大肆叫嚷：“党有没有领导得好？我看没有领导好，真正领导一定要是内行”，“一定要科学家领导科学，美术家领导美术，音乐家领导音乐。”他歪曲“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，大肆鼓吹“多样化”，积极推行资产阶级自由化。周扬的亲信钟惦棐，首先以《文艺报》评论员名义，经过周扬审查，敲起了《电影的锣鼓》。田汉提出了《为演员的青春请命》。邵荃麟到浙江等地放火，煽动文艺工作者攻击地方党委。夏衍也极力攻击党的领导。周扬一伙十分狡猾，后来发觉形势对他们不利，就看风转舵，暂时收敛，蒙混过关。他们就是这样一伙漏网的大右派。
    长期以来，周扬掩盖了文艺界这几次重大斗争的真相。他写文章，作报告，大肆吹嘘，竭力把自己说成是“一贯正确”的。直至去年，在全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会上，他还恬不知耻地大谈开国以来文艺界的几次重大斗争，歪曲斗争意义，为自己涂脂抹粉。但是，谎言终究掩盖不住事实，现在是把周扬的反革命修正主义面目拿出来示众，作彻底批判、彻底清算的时候了！
    二
    资产阶级是不愿退出历史舞台的。越是死到临头，它越要疯狂挣扎。一九六○年下半年开始，我国经济遭受了一些暂时的困难，国际上掀起了一阵反华大合唱。周扬一伙以为时机已到，又一次十分嚣张地向党向社会主义发动了猖狂进攻，企图在城市和农村中搞资本主义复辟的“大反复”。
    一九六二年，周扬在大连召开的“农村题材短篇小说创作座谈会”上，疯狂地攻击三面红旗，污蔑大跃进是“主观唯心主义”，人民公社“办早了”，极力鼓吹单干、包产到户。他和赫鲁晓夫完全唱着同一个调子。与此同时，周扬一伙又抛出了一个以“全民文艺”论为中心的彻头彻尾的修正主义文艺纲领，为资本主义反革命复辟加紧精神准备。当时，文化艺术领域中牛鬼蛇神霸占舞台，各种毒草大生大长，搞得乌烟瘴气。
    在这严重的时刻，毛主席又亲自发动和领导了文化艺术战线上的重大的斗争。
    一九六三年、一九六四年，毛主席对文艺工作接连作了两个具有伟大历史意义的批示。
      一九六三年十二月，毛主席指出：各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。
    一九六四年六月，毛主席在全国文联所属各协会整风时又指出：这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成像匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。毛主席的批示，极其深刻地指出了我国文艺战线上两条路线斗争的本质。它的矛头直接指向周扬把持下的文艺界这种极端严重的状况。
    然而周扬死不回头，他费尽了心机，耍出一套又一套的花招，极力抗拒毛主席的批示，抵制无产阶级文化大革命，妄图继续守住阵地，伺机反扑。
    第一，他直接反对毛主席的批示。一开始就加以封锁，不把指示往下传达。封锁不住了，瞒不下去了，他又大唱反调，极力鼓吹十五年来文化工作的“成就”。毛主席指出文艺界十五年来基本上不执行党的政策，周扬却说建国以来的文艺工作是“按照党的路线发展”的，“不要算老账”；毛主席指出社会主义改造在许多部门中至今收效甚微，周扬却恶毒地说“不能因为搞文化革命，就把队伍看成漆黑一团”。在文化部整风运动总结中，他还恶毒地埋下一颗定时炸弹，说什么“到底有什么路线错误啊？我们要议一下。如果没有，我们就修改。”准备随时翻案，以便把一切化为乌有。
    第二，极力保护党羽，力图蒙混过关。在毛主席第二次批示下达后，他就亲自指挥党羽们作假检讨，说：现在“形势变了，过不去了”，只有“自己救自己”。“文化部只要有一个好的检查，再搞出几部好电影，几出好戏，几套好书，就可以了。”“我是要扶你们的，你们不主动，中宣部作靠山也靠不住”。后来，他看到夏衍已经保不住了，就提出：文化部的问题主要在电影方面，而电影的问题主要又在夏衍，准备“丢车保帅”，来保住全局。到文化部其他反党头子齐燕铭、陈荒煤等也一个个被揪出来后，周扬一面假惺惺地“整”了他们一下，暗中又向他们表明“苦衷”：“我要是不整你们，就会跟你们一起犯错误。”一面又一再给其它党羽打气，说：“中央派人来，也只能派一、二人来”，“我们在这里不是孤雁，是一群雁子，而且不是小雁，是一群老雁。”鼓励他们争取继续“在这里做领导工作”。等到文化部假整风结束时，周扬又想把已经决定调动工作的陈荒煤再拉回文化部来，他对陈荒煤说：你“可以到附近搞几期四清，再回文艺界来嘛！”周扬就是这样步步为营，顽固地坚持着他的反党阵地。
    第三，千方百计地为自己打掩护，尽力给自己开脱罪责。在文化部假整风中，他为着欺骗中央，严格规定：凡中宣部召开的会议材料和发的文件，一律不得印发；凡群众揭发中涉及中宣部的材料，一律不登简报；在印发的材料中，凡引用周扬讲话的地方，一律删除。他为着欺骗群众，又在大小会议上极力表白，把自己的问题说成只是“对文化战线上两条路线的斗争觉察迟了，行动慢了，有认识问题，也有官僚主义。”他耍尽种种手法，尽力诡辩。例如，他在文化部整风总结会议上说：“为资产阶级服务，在某种意义上，也可以讲。为各阶层服务，是站在无产阶级立场上，为资产阶级里边愿意接受无产阶级思想的人服务，不是为资产阶级的阶级服务。”真是语无伦次，无法自圆其说。谁都懂得，用无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想作斗争，其目的是为了消灭资产阶级，根本谈不上什么“为资产阶级服务”。周扬这个鼎鼎大名的“权威”，他的“理论”原来竟如此蹩脚！
    第四，打击革命左派，压制群众运动。假整风一开始，他就扬言：有些人“唯恐天下不乱”，“群众运动起来后，会出问题的”，“到一定火候，要注意掌握”。宣称：“整风主要依靠司局长”，规定不贴大字报，不搞大鸣大放大辩论，把斗争始终约束在少数人的小圈子中。对齐燕铭、夏衍、陈荒煤等人的批判，周扬也强调“不要揪住不放”，而匆促收场。他还一再强调批判“过火了”，“打击面太宽了”。到最后，就打出“整风要落实到生产上”的旗号，把这场假整风慌忙结束。
    在施展了一套又一套的花招以后，周扬洋洋得意，自以为这回又顺顺当当地滑过去了，而且想趁机捞上一笔新的政治资本。于是，他到处讲话，大肆吹捧由他领导的这次“整风”是“延安文艺整风运动以后第二次伟大的整风运动”，“比批判右派和批判胡风在某种意义上更深远”。在全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会的讲话中，他又歪曲毛主席的批示，大肆吹嘘自己在文化革命中的“功劳”；接着连忙出版了这个讲话，印行三十多万册，想把自己抬到更高的地位上去。
    周扬是从来不肯死心的。假整风一结束，他又重新发动新的攻势，他在华北区话剧歌剧观摩演出会座谈会上大讲“要敢于创新”，“要敢写矛盾”，“要敢讲不同意见”。这三个“敢”，是周扬的反动主张。所谓“敢于创新”，就是他一贯提倡的“离经叛道”！所谓“敢写矛盾”，就是他一贯鼓吹的“写真实”，写社会主义社会的“阴暗面”！所谓“敢讲不同意见”，就是鼓励人们起来反对党的领导。周扬在这篇讲话中，做贼心虚地说：“最怕的是一开口就扣上反党反社会主义的帽子，扣上资产阶级的帽子。”真是不打自招，这一来，倒把他顽强地坚持反党反社会主义、妄图实行资本主义复辟的狼子野心，更清楚地露了出来，这个钻进党内的文艺界资产阶级头号代理人的末日也就临头了。
    三
    周扬十分懂得资产阶级从事阶级斗争的策略。他明里一套，暗里一套；见风使舵，投机取巧。当资产阶级向无产阶级发动进攻时，他就加紧幕后活动，积极配合，煽风点火，大肆放毒。当无产阶级向资产阶级进行反击时，他又找一种颜色把自己掩护起来，装扮成党的代言人，转移斗争的目标，捞取政治资本。直至斗争烈火向他逼近，末日临头，他还会采取“以攻为守”的策略，作垂死挣扎。
    毛主席教导我们：被推翻了的剥削阶级，“他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会作各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”
    毛主席的这个教导，对于我们理解无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，认清反革命修正主义分子周扬的真面目，具有极其重要的意义。
    我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，把他们这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！使他们永世不得翻身！
