The news of China's successful test of a nuclear missile was like a thunderclap, resonating throughout Peking University. The entire campus was in a frenzy.

At midnight on the 27th, the campus radio station began broadcasting. The resonant songs awakened the students from their dreams. Was it morning already? But looking out the window, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. Checking the time, it was only a little past midnight. Yes, yes, there must be important news being broadcast. Many students, fearing they might not hear clearly, stuck their heads out the window, eagerly waiting...

Finally, the clear and powerful voice of the announcer came through: China has successfully tested a nuclear missile! The students jumped out of bed in joy. One student, forgetting he was in the upper bunk, jumped up in excitement and hit his head on the ceiling. "Quiet! Quiet!" The students suppressed their excitement, holding their breath, and listened carefully to the broadcast, afraid to miss a single word.

As soon as the broadcast ended, the entire university was drowned out by thunderous applause and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" The students immediately held up portraits of Chairman Mao, carried copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and took up drums and gongs, rushing from all directions like a tide towards the dining hall.

In the dining hall, flowers were tossed, red flags waved, drums beat, and lights shone brightly. Revolutionary songs like "The East is Red," "The Great Helmsman Steers the Ship," and "Father and Mother are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" were sung over and over. Slogans like "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoed louder and louder. The Cultural Revolution Committee Chairman, Comrade Nie Yuanzi, spoke at the celebration meeting. The students shouted slogans, celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. At this moment, red copies of the "People's Daily" extra editions flew in like snowflakes. Thousands of people swarmed together, thousands of hands reaching out to grab the extra editions. The students read aloud, word by word, sentence by sentence. Everyone said, this is the newest and best news, it is also a magnificent poem. Everyone firmly declared: We, the people of China, we, the Red Guards, will follow Chairman Mao in victory on the revolutionary path.

Vietnamese and Albanian students studying at our university also jumped out of bed in great excitement upon hearing the broadcast, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, and rushed to the meeting. The representative of the Vietnamese students also spoke excitedly at the meeting: China's successful test of a nuclear missile is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people! His speech sparked wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the revolutionary teachers and students. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "The Americans will be defeated! Vietnam will be victorious!" The slogans echoed through the night sky.

The warriors of the Long March to Jinggangshan, after the meeting, returned to their dormitories, unable to contain their excitement. At dawn, they would set out from Beijing to Jinggangshan, following Chairman Mao's teachings, to brave the storms, see the world, and accept challenges. At this moment, they had so much to say to their dear Chairman Mao! The great victory of China's nuclear missile test inspired the Long March team to bravely forge ahead on the revolutionary path. In front of the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, they picked up their pens and wrote their oaths for the march: "Today, the newest and best news has sounded a heroic march for us! Our aspirations are greater, our confidence is stronger. 'The Red Army is not afraid of long marches, ten thousand rivers and mountains are but trivial.' We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. We will broaden our horizons and march forward with unwavering determination!"

In the morning, the Red Guard warriors and revolutionary teachers and students, with hearts full of love for Chairman Mao and brimming with revolutionary spirit, quickly gathered, singing revolutionary songs. They were going to ride the east wind, greet the rising sun, and report the good news to Chairman Mao. They said: "We will learn from the spirit of the soldiers, workers, and scientific and technical personnel who participated in the nuclear test, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, always listen to Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end."

    跟着毛主席胜利前进
    北京大学　王董
    我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的喜讯，像一声春雷，响遍北大，全校沸腾了。
    二十七日午夜十二点多，校广播站开始播音了，嘹亮的歌声把同学们从睡梦中惊醒。是天亮了吗？可是望望窗外，月明星稀，看看表，才十二点多，对了，对了，一定有重要消息广播。许多同学怕听不清楚，把头伸到窗外，焦急地等着……。
    终于，传来了广播员清晰豪迈的声音：我国发射导弹核武器试验成功了！同学们乐得从床上跳了起来，有个同学，忘了自己睡在上铺，高兴地一蹦，把头撞在天棚上。“安静！安静！”同学们压制着内心的激动，屏着气，细心地收听广播，生怕漏过了一个字。
    广播刚一结束，整个北大就被震天动地的掌声和“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声淹没了。同学们立即举着毛主席像，带着《毛主席语录》本，拿起锣鼓，从四面八方像潮水一样向大饭厅涌去。
    大饭厅里，花束翻滚，红旗舞动，锣鼓喧天，灯火通明。《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》的革命歌曲唱了一遍又一遍，“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声一浪高过一浪。校文化革命委员会主任聂元梓同志在庆祝集会上讲了话。同学们高呼口号，欢庆毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这时，一张张红色的《人民日报》号外，雪片似地飞来，千百个人蜂拥在一起，千百双手抢着要号外，同学们一个字一个字的看，一句一句的朗诵。大家都说，这是最新最好的消息，也是壮丽的诗篇。大家都坚定地表示：我们中国人民，我们的红卫兵，就是要这样跟着毛主席在革命路上胜利前进。
    在我校学习的越南和阿尔巴尼亚的留学生，听到广播，也无比兴奋地跳下了床，高举着毛主席像，赶来参加大会。越南留学生代表还在集会上激动地说：中国发射导弹核武器试验的成功，是对越南人民的极大鼓舞！他的讲话激起全场革命师生一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。“毛主席万岁！”“胡主席万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“美帝必败！越南必胜！”的口号声响彻夜空。
    井冈山长征队的战士们，集会后回到宿舍里，怎么也抑制不住心头的激情。天明后，他们就要按照毛主席的教导，踏上从北京到井冈山的征途，去经风雨，见世面，接受考验。此时此刻，他们有多少话儿要对亲人毛主席诉说啊！我国导弹核武器试验成功的大胜利，鼓舞了长征队同志们在革命路上去勇敢地锻炼。他们在伟大领袖毛主席的像前，拿起笔写下了出征的誓言：“今天，最新最好的消息，为我们吹响了一支雄壮的进军号！我们的雄心更大、信心更足了。‘红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲’！我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要放开眼界看未来，坚定不移向前进！”
    早晨，红卫兵战士、革命师生，带着对毛主席无限热爱的心情，满怀着革命豪情，唱着革命歌曲迅速地集合起来，他们要乘着东风，迎着朝阳，去向毛主席他老人家报喜。他们说：“我们要学习参加核试验的解放军指战员、工人和科学技术人员的精神，活学活用毛主席著作，要永远听毛主席的话，关心国家大事，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
