They resolved to overcome the obstacles posed by U.S. imperialism and various reactionary forces to promote the fighting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Japan. Both sides expressed their unwavering support for the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 9th, the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's delegation to China jointly signed a statement in Beijing this evening.

The statement expressed that both sides resolved to overcome the sabotage by U.S. imperialism, the Sato government, modern revisionism, and various new and old followers and other reactionary forces that attempt to obstruct the solidarity of the two countries' peoples. They will strive together to promote the fighting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Japan.

Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and others attended the signing ceremony.

At the signing ceremony, Liao Chengzhi, the chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and Sakamoto Tokumatsu, the leader of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's delegation to China and the chairman of the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, signed the joint statement on behalf of both sides.

Chinese officials attending the signing ceremony included Zhao Yimin, Zhang Xiangshan, and other relevant leaders.

Japanese officials attending the signing ceremony included members of the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's delegation to China, members of the Japan-China Friendship Association led by Kuromiya Jutaro and Miyazaki Shinkin, and Japanese peace activists in Beijing such as Saionji Kichinosuke and other Japanese friends.

The full text of the joint statement by the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's delegation to China is as follows:

At the invitation of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee's delegation to China participated in the celebrations of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and visited various facilities in the capital, Beijing. Currently, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, China is carrying out a great proletarian cultural revolution. The Japanese delegation was deeply impressed by this. This movement is sweeping away all the filth left over from the old society of the exploiting classes and is establishing new proletarian thoughts, culture, customs, and habits. The Japanese delegation has high hopes for this unprecedented great cause.

The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity expressed its respect for the consistent stance of the Japanese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity in opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and for its activities to strengthen the solidarity of the peoples of Asia and Africa and to uphold the correct line of the Afro-Asian peoples' solidarity movement.

Currently, the Japanese people are engaged in a tenacious struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, opposing the aggression against Vietnam, demanding the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, opposing the docking of U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers in Japanese ports, demanding the return of Okinawa and the Bonin Islands, demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and striving to abolish the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." The Chinese people firmly support the Japanese people's heroic anti-imperialist and patriotic just struggle and are convinced that the Japanese people will overcome all obstacles on their path forward and ultimately achieve Japan's independence, democracy, and peace.

Both sides unanimously emphasized:

The current international situation is excellent and favorable for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. In recent years, amidst the great upheavals in the world, imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries have become increasingly isolated. The modern revisionists led by the Soviet Union have further exposed their true colors as accomplices of U.S. imperialism. The revolutionary consciousness of the peoples of various countries has greatly increased.

The U.S. imperialism, which is in a predicament, in order to save its doomed fate, on the one hand, is frantically carrying out aggression in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and on the other hand, is using cunning neo-colonialist tactics to try to deceive the masses. However, the peoples of the three continents who demand complete national independence and freedom are bravely resisting oppression, exposing the fraud, and are pushing the struggle forward with increasing intensity, depth, and momentum. Both sides unanimously expressed their unwavering support for the national liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and firmly believe that they will ultimately achieve victory.

The current focus of the world's anti-imperialist struggle is in Vietnam. Both sides warmly applaud the glorious victories of the heroic Vietnamese people in the anti-American national salvation war. Both sides strongly condemn the various "peace talks" conspiracies instigated by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. Both sides firmly support the Vietnamese people in overcoming all difficulties and continuing the anti-American national salvation war until the last U.S. aggressor is driven out of Vietnam.

The Soviet modern revisionists and their cohorts are doing everything they can to obstruct and sabotage the national liberation movements, pushing a line of surrender in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Recently, they have been shamelessly carrying out divisive activities in the Afro-Asian solidarity movement, frantically attempting to sabotage the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing in June-July this year, and are now trying to sabotage the fifth conference of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization scheduled to be held in Beijing next year.

The peoples of Asia and Africa absolutely cannot tolerate such evil divisive sabotage plots. These plots will not succeed. The solidarity of the peoples of Asia and Africa will be further strengthened. Both sides will do their utmost to ensure the successful convening of the Beijing conference.

Both sides unanimously believe that the friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Japan are in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and have great significance for the liberation of the peoples of Asia and Africa and the defense of world peace.

Both sides resolved to overcome the sabotage by U.S. imperialism, the Sato government, modern revisionism, and various new and old followers and other reactionary forces that attempt to obstruct the solidarity of the two countries' peoples. They will strengthen the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, strengthen the exchange of experiences and friendly visits between the Afro-Asian solidarity committees of the two countries, strive to achieve the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival, and strive together to promote the fighting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Japan.

    我亚非团结会和日本亚非团结会访华代表团发表共同声明
    决心排除美帝和各种反动势力阻碍  促进中日两国人民战斗友谊和团结
    双方表示始终不渝地支持亚非拉人民的民族解放斗争
    据新华社九日讯　中国亚非团结委员会、日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团共同声明，今晚在北京签字。
    声明表示，双方决心排除企图阻挠两国人民团结的美帝国主义、佐藤政府、现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者和其他各种反动势力的破坏，为促进中日两国人民的战斗友谊和团结而共同奋斗。
    郭沫若、刘宁一等参加了签字仪式。
    在签字仪式上，中国亚非团结委员会主任廖承志和日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团团长、日本亚非团结委员会理事长坂本德松代表双方在共同声明上签了字。
    中国方面参加签字仪式的，还有赵毅敏、张香山等有关方面负责人。
    日本方面参加签字仪式的，还有日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团成员，以黑田寿男、宫崎世民为首的日中友协代表团成员，在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一和其他日本朋友。
    中国亚非团结委员会和日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团共同声明的全文如下：
    应中国亚非团结委员会邀请前来中国访问的日本亚非团结委员会访华代表团，参加了中华人民共和国成立十七周年的庆祝活动，参观了首都北京的各种设施。目前，中国正在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，开展着一场翻天覆地的无产阶级文化大革命运动。日本代表团对此深为感佩。这个运动正在荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水，正在大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。日本代表团对于这一史无前例的伟大事业，寄予衷心的期待。
    中国亚非团结委员会对日本亚非团结委员会一贯坚持反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的立场，为加强亚非人民的团结、维护亚非人民团结运动正确路线而开展的活动，深表敬意。
    目前，日本人民正在进行着顽强的斗争，反对美帝国主义和日本反动派，反对侵略越南战争，要求撤销美国军事基地，反对美国核潜艇和核航空母舰“停泊”日本港口，要求归还冲绳和小笠原群岛，要求恢复日中两国邦交，争取废除“日美安全保障条约”。中国人民坚决支持日本人民这一英勇的反美爱国正义斗争，并深信日本人民必将排除前进道路上的各种障碍，最后赢得日本的独立、民主与和平。
    双方一致强调指出：
    当前的国际形势是大好的，是有利于全世界人民的革命斗争的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。近几年来，在世界的大动荡中，以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派越来越孤立，以苏联领导为中心的现代修正主义者更加暴露出它充当美帝国主义帮凶的真面目。各国人民的革命觉悟大大提高了。
    陷于困境的美帝国主义，为了挽救它灭亡的命运，一方面疯狂地在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲进行侵略，另一方面又使用狡猾的新殖民主义手法，企图欺骗人民群众。但是，要求完全的民族独立和自由的三大洲人民，英勇地反抗镇压，揭露骗局，并且日益激烈地、深入地、气势磅礴地把斗争推向前进。双方一致表示，始终不渝地支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族解放斗争，并坚信他们必将取得最后胜利。
    当前世界人民反帝斗争的焦点是在越南。双方热烈欢呼英雄的越南人民在抗美救国战争中取得的辉煌胜利。双方强烈谴责美帝国主义及其帮凶策动的形形色色的“和谈”阴谋。双方坚决支持越南人民克服一切困难，把抗美救国战争进行到底，直到把美国侵略者一个不剩地从越南赶出去。
    苏联现代修正主义者及其一伙千方百计地阻挠和破坏民族解放运动，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区竭力推行投降主义路线。最近，他们在亚非人民团结运动中肆无忌惮地进行分裂活动，疯狂地图谋破坏今年六月——七月在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议，现在又妄图破坏已经决定明年在北京召开的亚非人民团结组织第五届大会。
    亚非人民绝对不能容许这种罪恶的分裂破坏阴谋。这种阴谋绝不能得逞。亚非人民的团结必将日益巩固。双方将竭尽全力为北京大会的胜利召开而进行努力。
    双方一致认为，中日两国人民的友好团结，是符合中日两国人民的根本利益的，对于亚洲、非洲各民族的解放和保卫世界和平具有重大的意义。
    双方决心排除企图阻挠两国人民团结的美帝国主义、佐藤政府、现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者和其他各种反动势力的破坏，加强中日两国人民的友好交流，加强中日两国亚非团结委员会之间的经验交流和友好往来，争取实现第二届中日青年友好大联欢，为促进中日两国人民的战斗友谊和团结而共同奋斗。
