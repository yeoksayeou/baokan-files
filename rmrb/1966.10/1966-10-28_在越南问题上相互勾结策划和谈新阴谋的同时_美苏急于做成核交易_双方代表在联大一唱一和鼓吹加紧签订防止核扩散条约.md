While the United States and the Soviet Union are busily conspiring to plot new "bombing halt for peace talks" schemes on the Vietnam issue, they are also engaged in intense backroom dealings on other major issues. Reports indicate that, following Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's recent visit to the United States, negotiations on the so-called prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation are being expedited.

On the 23rd, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg delivered a television speech in which he once again expressed optimism about the prospect of signing a treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation. He said that his optimism stems from the fact that "I believe the current atmosphere is better than any time since we (referring to the U.S., USSR, and UK) signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963." In his speech, he praised Soviet Representative Fedorenko's remarks on the 20th at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee on this issue as a "constructive speech," and pointed out that this indicates the Soviet Union's desire to sign such a treaty.

According to reports, Fedorenko's speech on the 20th during the UN General Assembly Political Committee's discussion on disarmament emphasized the Soviet government's eagerness to reach a deal with the United States on preventing nuclear proliferation to maintain their nuclear monopoly. He reiterated that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated for the signing of a treaty to prevent nuclear proliferation and repeatedly stressed that all "preconditions" for resolving this issue are now in place, and that "there are no insurmountable difficulties" in resolving this issue.

Fedorenko's speech immediately received a warm response from Goldberg. Goldberg said, "I am pleased to inform the committee that the U.S. and the USSR have agreed to utilize this more hopeful new situation. We are continuing to explore together ways to eliminate our remaining differences that both sides can accept." He emphasized that the current situation gives him "considerable hope" for progress on disarmament issues.

Western newspapers and news agencies reported that the further "improvement" in the atmosphere on disarmament issues began after Gromyko's talks with U.S. President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk. Following their talks, U.S. representative Foster and Soviet representative Roshchin began secret bilateral talks in the United States on disarmament issues. The reports also revealed that, due to both sides' eagerness to reach a deal on preventing nuclear proliferation, their "differences" over West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons are also gradually being resolved.

    在越南问题上相互勾结策划和谈新阴谋的同时
    美苏急于做成核交易
    双方代表在联大一唱一和鼓吹加紧签订防止核扩散条约
    新华社二十四日讯  美苏两国在加紧勾结就越南问题策划新的“停炸迫和”阴谋的同时，在其他一些重大问题上，也正在大作幕后交易。据报道，在苏联外交部长葛罗米柯最近访美之后，双方在所谓防止核武器扩散问题上的交易正在加紧进行。
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡二十三日发表电视谈话时，再次对于签订一项防止核扩散条约的前景表示“乐观”。他说，他之所以抱乐观态度，是因为“我认为目前的气氛比一九六三年我们（按：指美苏英三国）签订部分禁止核试验条约以来任何时候都要好。”他在谈话中吹捧苏联代表费德林二十日在联合国大会政治委员会就这个问题的发言是“建设性的发言”，并且指出，这表明苏联希望签订这样一项条约。
    据报道，费德林二十日在联大政委会讨论裁军问题时的发言，强调表示了苏联政府急于在防止核扩散问题上同美国作成交易以保持美苏核垄断地位的心情。他重申，苏联一贯主张签订一项防止核扩散条约，并且反复强调说，目前已经具备了解决这个问题的“一切先决条件”，“在解决这个问题方面，没有不可克服的困难”。
    费德林的发言立即得到了戈德堡的热烈响应。戈德堡说：“我很高兴地通知本委员会，美苏已经同意利用这种比较使人抱希望的新形势。我们正在继续一起探索共同都能接受的消除我们剩下的分歧的办法。”他强调说，目前的局势使他对于裁军问题的取得进展抱有“相当大的希望”。
    西方报刊和通讯社的消息指出，在裁军问题上气氛的进一步“改善”，是从葛罗米柯同美国总统约翰逊、国务卿腊斯克会谈后开始的。在他们会谈之后，出席日内瓦裁军谈判的美国代表福斯特同苏联代表罗申在美国就裁军问题开始了双边秘密会谈。消息还透露，由于双方都急于在防止核扩散问题上成交，它们在西德染指核武器问题上的“分歧”也正在逐步消除中。
