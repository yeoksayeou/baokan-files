Patriotic armed forces in the Congo (Leopoldville) are waging a tenacious struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Mobutu clique. They attach great importance to the study of Chairman Mao's military works and have begun to apply Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle.

A Congolese (L) freedom fighter recently told a New China News Agency correspondent here that after the Congolese (L) patriotic armed forces studied Chairman Mao's "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," which he formulated for the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the discipline of the fighters improved and their relations with the masses became closer. He said this was a fruit of studying and applying Chairman Mao's thought on building a revolutionary army.

The Congolese (L) patriotic armed forces have also studied Chairman Mao's expositions on criticizing the purely military viewpoint and have strengthened political and ideological work in the troops. They have used criticism and self-criticism to raise the political consciousness of the fighters and overcome such ideas as absolute egalitarianism.

The Congolese (L) patriotic armed forces have seriously studied Chairman Mao's theories on people's war and the experience of the Chinese revolutionary army in relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and serving the masses. After studying the theories of strategy and tactics of people's war, they have gradually overcome the idea of hastening to attack big cities and have begun to establish the idea of building rural base areas.

The Congolese (L) patriots attach great importance to the study of Chairman Mao's "Ten Military Principles" and his expositions on the policy of self-reliance and on seizing the enemy's weapons to arm oneself.

The Congolese (L) freedom fighter said with confidence: The road of revolution is tortuous, but as long as we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, all difficulties are temporary, and the future of the revolution is bright.

    一位刚果（利）自由战士最近在这里对新华社记者说，刚果（利）爱国武装的战士们在学习了毛泽东主席为中国工农红军制订的“三大纪律、八项注意”以后，纪律性增强了，同群众的关系也更加密切了。他说，这是学习和应用毛泽东主席关于建设革命军队的思想的一个成果。
    刚果（利）爱国武装还学习了毛主席关于批判单纯军事观点的论述，并且在部队中加强了政治思想工作，运用批评和自我批评的武器来提高战士们的政治觉悟，克服了绝对平均主义等思想。
    刚果（利）爱国武装认真地学习了毛主席关于人民战争的理论，学习中国革命军队依靠群众、发动群众、为群众服务的经验。他们在学习了人民战争的战略战术的理论后，不断克服急于攻打大城市的思想，并且逐步树立了建立农村根据地的思想。
    刚果（利）爱国者十分重视学习毛主席提出的“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”的十六字诀以及毛主席关于实行自力更生的政策和夺取敌人的武器来武装自己等论述。
    刚果（利）的自由战士满怀信心地说，革命道路是有曲折的，但是，只要按照毛泽东思想办事，任何困难都是暂时的，革命的前景是光辉的。
