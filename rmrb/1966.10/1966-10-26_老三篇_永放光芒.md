Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call to elevate our army's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level is the greatest concern for all cadres and soldiers in our army. It is the timely rain for our healthy growth and a powerful driving force for our army's ideological revolution. I firmly respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call and will definitely study and apply the "Three Articles" and other works of Chairman Mao, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the unified action guideline for our entire Party, army, and people. It is our lifeline and the eternal red sun in our hearts. Bones can be broken, and legs can be injured, but the brilliant works of Chairman Mao must be studied! On May 30 last year, I was severely injured while rescuing a comrade. When the commander came to visit me in the hospital, my first request was to bring me Chairman Mao's works. I knew that to overcome death and pain, there is only the great treasure of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past, by reading Chairman Mao's books, I understood the meaning of serving the people. The images of Zhang Zedong, Dr. Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains inspired me to risk my life five times to rescue comrades. After being injured and hospitalized, the great Mao Zedong Thought encouraged me to overcome pain and disability time and time again. While lying in bed, I insisted on reading Chairman Mao's works. The nurses saw me struggling to turn the pages with my tongue and advised, "Old Wang, wait until you recover and have the strength to study!" I said, "No, I can only study Chairman Mao's works to gain strength!" Indeed, reading Chairman Mao's books and listening to Chairman Mao's words is like having Chairman Mao by my side. I understand the true meaning of life and revolution more deeply. The more I read, the stronger and more optimistic I become, truly full of energy and fearless.

Since I began studying Chairman Mao's works, the "Three Articles" have been the most beneficial and effective. The "Three Articles" have helped me establish an initial revolutionary worldview. They are the motto of revolutionary practice. The "Three Articles" bring new insights with each reading and new understandings with each application. I will study the "Three Articles" for a lifetime, apply them for a lifetime, and pass them down as revolutionary heirlooms to younger comrades and my children, generation after generation, so that the spirit of the "Three Articles" will forever shine brightly!

In times of war, powerful enemies did not frighten me. Because Chairman Mao taught us: "This army has an unyielding spirit, it will overcome all enemies and never be subdued by them."

When comrades were in danger, the explosion of grenades did not frighten me. Because Chairman Mao taught us: "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionaries must care for, love, and help each other."

When I was severely injured, death did not frighten me. Because Chairman Mao taught us: "To struggle is to have sacrifices"; "To die for the people is a worthy death."

During treatment, pain did not frighten me. Because Chairman Mao taught us: "Against illness, one must have a strong will to fight."

When I lost my legs, disability did not frighten me. Because Chairman Mao taught us: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage."

I believe that in the future, no matter how powerful the enemy, how great the difficulty, or how severe the test, nothing will frighten me. Because in my heart, I have the great Mao Zedong Thought and the inspiration of heroes like Zhang Zedong, Dr. Bethune, the Old Man Moving Mountains, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ou Yanghai, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun. I fear nothing, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and I will definitely complete every task given to me by the Party.

    “老三篇”永放光芒
    福建前线空军某部管理员　王裕昌
    林彪副主席关于把我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段的伟大号召，是对我军全体干部战士的最大关怀，是我们健康成长的“及时雨”，是我军实现思想革命化的新的强大推动力量。我最坚决地响应林彪副主席的伟大号召，一定活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席的其它著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    毛泽东思想是我们全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领，是我们的命根子，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。骨可碎，腿可折，光辉的毛主席著作不能不学！去年五月三十日，我为抢救战友，身负重伤。当首长来到医院看望我时，我第一个要求就是把毛主席著作给我捎来。因为我知道要战胜死亡和伤痛，只有毛泽东思想这一伟大的法宝。
    过去，我靠读毛主席的书，懂得了为人民服务的道理。张思德、白求恩、老愚公的形象，鼓舞着我冒着生命危险五次抢救战友。我负伤入院后，伟大的毛泽东思想鼓励我一次又一次地战胜病痛和伤残。我在病床上，坚持读毛主席著作。护士们见我艰难地用舌头翻动书页，就劝我说：“老王呵，等你伤好了，有了力气再学吧！”我说：“不，我只有学习毛主席著作，才有力气！”确实是这样，读着毛主席的书，听着毛主席的话，就像毛主席站在我的身边一样；对于人生，对于革命，我更加懂得了它的真正意义。我越读越坚强，越乐观，真是浑身带劲，无所畏惧。
    我开始学习毛主席著作以来，学得最多、最见成效的就是“老三篇”。“老三篇”教育我初步树立了革命的世界观。它是革命实践的座右铭。“老三篇”，学一遍有一遍新的收获，用一遍有一遍新的体会。我要学一辈子“老三篇”，用一辈子“老三篇”。并把它当成革命的传家宝，传给年轻的同志，传给我的子女，代代传下去，让“老三篇”的精神永放光芒！
    在战争的年代里，强大的敌人没有吓倒我。因为毛主席教导说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”
    在战士遇险的时候，手榴弹的爆炸没有吓倒我，因为毛主席教导说：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    在我身负重伤的时候，死亡没有吓倒我，因为毛主席教导说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲”；“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”。
    在治疗的时候，伤痛没有吓倒我，因为毛主席教导说：“对于病，要有坚强的斗争意志”。
    在我失去了双腿的时候，残废也没有吓倒我，因为毛主席教导说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    我相信：今后无论任何强大的敌人，任何巨大的困难，任何严峻的考验，都不能吓倒我。因为我心中有着伟大的毛泽东思想，有着张思德、白求恩、老愚公、雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、刘英俊等英雄形象的鼓舞，我就什么也不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，一定能够完成党交给我的每项任务。
