We are a team of 28 young girls who formed a well-digging brigade. These girls, who were once considered "little yellow-haired girls," dared to do what women in the past did not dare to do. We dug 11 large wells for the brigade, which played a significant role in this year's drought resistance and sowing. It was Chairman Mao's book that gave us the revolutionary courage and strength to dare to challenge the old world and grow in class struggle and production struggle.

Fighting Against Old Customs

This spring, our brigade encountered a drought. To resist the drought and to quickly achieve water conservation and remove the label of low yield and backwardness, the brigade organized some people with well-digging skills to form a well-digging team.

However, some of those with well-digging skills had old-fashioned thinking and demanded alcohol, grain subsidies, and high work points from the collective according to old customs. Everyone felt that their demands were unreasonable, but for a while, no one else with well-digging skills could be found, so their demands were met. More than 40 days passed, but the well-digging team had not dug a single well.

At this time, the community members were buzzing with discussions. At that time, we, a group of girls, were studying Chairman Mao's works under the organization of the Communist Youth League. We learned a passage from Chairman Mao: "The world belongs to you, it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and in the prime of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hopes are placed on you." This passage gave us great encouragement. Some said, "We must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us. We must take up the class banner, inherit the revolutionary cause, and shoulder the responsibility of building a new socialist countryside." Everyone thought: To build a new countryside, we must revolutionize and break away from all old things. Where do we start? Everyone was unhappy with the well-digging team's demands for food, drink, and work points before even starting to dig a well. Everyone decided to break the old rules and dig the wells ourselves. After coordinating, we 28 girls from poor peasant families formed a women's well-digging brigade and decided to work hard.

However, the resistance from old customs was still strong. First, the parents did not agree. Some parents were afraid of accidents; they were afraid that their daughters would be overworked, etc.

The parents blocked the way, what do we do? According to the old customs, children should obey their parents. But now, we are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, and we must be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Chairman Mao said: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses." If we do not break free from the feudal selfish thoughts and jump out of the small circle of personal family, how can we face the wind and rain, see the world, and be tempered in the struggle of the masses and in the great storms and stresses? The words of the father, the words of the mother, we must measure them with Chairman Mao's words. If it is beneficial to the revolution, we listen; if it is not beneficial to the revolution, we do not listen. We decided to fight and persuade the parents.

To persuade the parents, we first helped them raise their class consciousness. We asked the parents to tell us the village history and family history, and we read Chairman Mao's works to them. In this way, we persuaded many parents who did not agree. The most difficult to persuade was Liu Yumei's mother, Liu Grandma. Because Liu Yumei's father died in 1953 from an accident while digging a well. Whenever someone mentioned digging a well, Liu Yumei's mother would worry. Now her daughter Yumei wanted to dig a well, and she said she would not agree to it no matter what. To persuade Liu Grandma, we girls read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to her, read it and then explained it. Finally, Liu Grandma agreed, saying: "Comrade Bethune is a foreigner who helped us fight the Japanese and was not afraid of death. We are building our own socialism, so how can we be afraid of hardship and danger?"

Fighting Against Old Customs

After breaking through the parents' resistance, there was still strong resistance from society. As soon as our well-digging brigade was formed, it quickly spread throughout the village. Some people did not like our actions and said all sorts of things. Some said: "If dung beetles can pull a cart, who would still buy big donkeys and horses?" Some said: "Little yellow-haired girls want to become spirits!" Hearing these unpleasant words, some could not take it and said: "Forget it! What can't we do? Why suffer this humiliation?" At this critical moment, should we retreat? No, we will not. This is not a matter of whether we suffer or not, but a matter of whether we dare to break old customs. If we do not dare to insist, this is a compromise with old customs. Thinking of this, everyone sat down again, opened Chairman Mao's works, studied the teachings related to class and class struggle, and also studied the model deeds of Lü Yulan. Everyone was greatly encouraged and said: Comrade Yulan can withstand great storms and stresses for the revolution, can we not withstand this cold wind? Everyone unanimously said: Doing revolution cannot be afraid of ghosts, we must set sail against the wind and charge forward.

In this way, we started digging the wells and worked hard. We 28 girls had never dug a well before, but we fearlessly started working.

Fighting Against Difficulties

In the process of digging wells, we encountered difficulties again.

We 28 girls competed with each other to dig the wells, but we had no skills. Among us, the youngest was 16 years old, and the oldest was only 21. Most of us were just out of school, and some had felt dizzy just by looking into a well in the past. In the fields, how to allocate labor, how to dig the well shaft, where to throw the soil, none of us had done these things before.

What do we do if we don't know? We remembered the phrase "look up the dictionary for new words, and study 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' for problems" and took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to study together. Although Chairman Mao did not talk about how to dig wells, Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a matter for the masses, often not learning first and then doing, but doing first and then learning." He also said, "Our comrades should see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." Reading this, everyone's hearts lit up. Everyone said, "Follow Chairman Mao's words, learn while doing, as long as we have the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, there is no fire mountain that we cannot cross."

On March 15th of this year, everyone started digging with all their might, and after digging a few zhang deep, they encountered hard ant sand. The shovels could not dig, and the picks could not shovel. Everyone's hands were shaken and broken, and the progress slowed down. It was at this moment that we studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" again. Zhang Fuhua said: "The Foolish Old Man could move mountains, and we can dig wells. No matter how hard the sand and stones are, they are not harder than people armed with Mao Zedong Thought." The shovels were not effective, so we used pointed picks to dig. Under the inspiration of the Foolish Old Man's spirit, we finally broke through the ant sand layer. Everyone dug mud and water, and everyone became a mud person. Coming up, they rushed to pull the slide car, but no one complained of fatigue. Because we were united and full of energy, the first well was completed in just 16 days, with a work efficiency two to three times faster than the male community well-digging team. We did not ask for grain subsidies, did not record high work points, and did not drink a drop of alcohol.

The first shot was fired, and everyone's morale was even higher. Then two wells, three wells, by mid-July, in four months, a total of 11 large wells were dug. Irrigating over 1,700 mu of land, ensuring the brigade's spring sowing, summer sowing, and this year's autumn harvest.

The wells were dug, the cold wind did not blow, and the parents were also happy. It also had a great promotional effect on the male community well-digging team. The community members called us the Red Girls Well-Digging Brigade.

Through the victory of this well-digging struggle, we have strongly impacted the old customs, old habits, and old ideas that people brought from the old society. However, our achievements are still very limited. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to forge ahead.

### 毛主席的书给了我们革命的胆略和力量

    毛主席的书给了我们革命的胆略和力量
    河北省易县凌云册公社西牛大队红姑娘打井突击队队长　龙凤珍
    我们是由二十八名年轻姑娘组成的一个打井突击队。我们这些被人认为是“黄毛丫头”的女孩子，敢于做过去妇女不敢做的事情，给大队打成了十一眼大井，对今年抗旱播种起了很大的作用。是毛主席的书给了我们革命的胆略和力量，敢于向旧世界挑战，使我们在阶级斗争和生产斗争中成长起来。
    向旧习惯斗
    我们大队今年春天遇上干旱。为了抗旱，同时为了早日实现水利化，摘掉低产落后帽子，大队把一些有打井技术的人组织起来，成立了一个打井班。
    可是，有一些有打井技术的人却满脑子旧思想，按旧习惯向集体讲价钱，他们要酒喝，要补助粮，还要记高工分。大家觉得他们提出这些要求不对，可一时又再也找不出有打井技术的人来，便答应了他们的要求。四十多天过去了，这个打井班却一眼井也没有打成。
    这时社员们议论纷纷。当时我们一伙姑娘正在共青团支部的组织下学习毛主席著作。我们学到毛主席说的一段话：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”这段话给了我们很大鼓舞。有的说：“我们决不能辜负毛主席对我们的期望，要掌阶级印，接革命班，把建设社会主义新农村的重担挑起来。”大家想：要建设新农村就得革命，就得破除一切旧的东西。从哪里做起呢？大家对打井班井还没有打就先讲吃、喝和工分，很不满意。大家决心打破老规矩，由我们来打井。经过串连，我们二十八个贫下中农家庭出身的女孩子组成了一个妇女打井突击队，决定大干一场。
    可是，旧习惯势力的阻力还很大。首先是家长不同意。有些家长怕出事故；怕把自己的姑娘累坏等等。
    家长挡了车，怎么办？按照老辈子的习惯，做儿女的只得听家长的。可现在，我们是毛泽东时代的青年，要作无产阶级革命事业的接班人。毛主席说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们要不冲破封建自私思想的束缚，跳不出个人家庭的小圈子，怎么能经风雨，见世面，在群众斗争中，在大风大浪里锻炼呢？爹的话，娘的话，都得用毛主席的话作尺子量一量，对革命有利的就听，对革命不利的，我们就不听。我们决定斗争，说服家长。
    为了说服家长，我们先帮助家长提高阶级觉悟，找家长们给我们讲村史和家史，我们给他们读毛主席著作。这样，我们把很多不同意的家长都说服了。最难说服的是刘玉梅的母亲刘大娘。因为玉梅爹是在一九五三年掏井时被砸受伤死的。谁一提掏井，玉梅娘就揪心。现在她女儿玉梅要去打井，她说什么也不干。为了说服刘大娘，我们几个姑娘给她念《纪念白求恩》，念了又讲。最后，刘大娘同意了，她说：“人家白求恩是个外国人，帮助咱们打日本还不怕死呢，咱们建设自己的社会主义还能怕苦怕危险？”
    向旧风俗斗
    打破了家长这一关，社会上的阻力还很大。我们打井突击队一成立，很快就在村子里传开了，有些人对我们的行动看不惯，七言八语说什么的都有。有的说：“屎克螂要能拉大车，谁还买大骡子大马？”有的说：“黄毛丫头想成精啦！”听了这些刺耳的话，有的顶不住了，说：“算了吧！干什么不行，何必受这个窝囊气。”在这个节骨眼上，我们难道打退堂鼓吗？不，决不。这不是受气不受气的问题，是敢不敢破旧风俗的问题。如果我们不敢坚持，这就是对旧风俗的妥协。想到这里，大家又坐下来，翻开毛主席著作，学习有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，还学习了吕玉兰的模范事迹，大家受到很大鼓舞，都说：人家玉兰姐为革命能顶住大风大浪，咱们就顶不住这么一阵冷风吗？大家一致表示：干革命就不能怕鬼，开起顶风船，冲上去。
    这样，我们就动手打井，干起来了。我们二十八个姑娘，从没有打过井，但是我们天不怕、地不怕地干起来了。
    向困难斗
    在打井的劳动中我们又遇上了困难。
    我们二十八个姑娘，打起井来比着劲的干，可是我们没有技术。我们这班人，小的十六岁，大的不过二十一。又大都是刚出校门的学生，有的过去到井口去望望就感到眼晕。到了地里，劳力怎么支配，井筒怎么挖，土往那里扔，这些事儿谁都没干过。
    不会怎么办？我们想起“有了生字查字典，有了问题学‘毛选’”这句话来，便拿出《毛主席语录》大家学习。毛主席虽然没有讲怎样打井，可毛主席说：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”又说“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”读到这里，大家的心里亮了。都说“听毛主席的话，边干边学，只要有毛泽东思想的指引，没有过不去的火焰山。”
    今年三月十五日，大家七手八脚地就挖起来，挖了几丈深以后，遇到了坚硬的蚂蚁沙，铁锨铲不动，大镐刨不动，每个人的手都被震破了，进度慢下来。就在这个时候，我们又重新学习了《愚公移山》。张福花说：“愚公能移山，咱就能打井，沙石再硬也硬不过毛泽东思想武装起来的人。”铁锨不行，我们就用尖嘴镐来刨。在愚公精神的鼓舞下，终于打透了蚂蚁沙层。大家挖泥掏水，一个个都成了泥人，上来又抢着拉滑车，但没有一个喊累的。由于我们心齐劲头足，第一眼井只用了十六天就完成了，比男社员打井班的工作效率快二、三倍。我们也没要补助粮，没记高工分，没喝一两酒。
    第一炮打响了，大家的劲头更大了，接着两眼、三眼，到七月中旬，四个月时间一共打了十一眼大井。浇地一千七百多亩，保证了大队的春播、夏播和今年的秋季丰收。
    井打成了，冷风也不吹了，家长们也高兴了，对男社员的打井班也起到很大促进作用。社员们称我们是红姑娘打井突击队。
    通过打井这一斗争的胜利，有力地冲击了人们从旧社会带来的旧风俗、旧习惯、旧思想。但是，我们的工作成绩还是很有限的，我们决心要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续奋勇前进。（新华社）
