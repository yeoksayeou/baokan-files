Chairman Mao's directive to turn every industry into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military training is excellent and timely. It aligns perfectly with the aspirations of workers. I wholeheartedly endorse and enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, striving to become a new-type worker who is both a worker and a farmer, and who is cultured and militarily trained.

In the past, my thinking was narrow. I believed that a worker's job was simply to work in the factory and focus on production. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I realized that this perspective was insufficient. I need to see beyond the factory to the nation and the world. I persist in studying Chairman Mao's works every day, broadening my horizons and enlightening my thoughts. I do what aligns with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly oppose what does not. At the beginning of this year, the higher authorities proposed a factory-commune partnership, linking our factory with Qingxi Commune. Workers were to take turns working in the fields. I fully supported this worker-farmer initiative. Before it was my turn, I volunteered on weekends to work in the fields, learning not only farming skills but also strengthening the bond between workers and farmers. This helped me understand the needs of poor and lower-middle peasants, enabling us to improve our work and product quality. Since the Cultural Revolution began, I have actively participated in criticizing the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the class enemy. Simultaneously, I have been diligently studying politics, military affairs, and culture.

What I have done so far falls short of Chairman Mao's standards, but I have already felt a significant change in my thinking. In June, the second machining group received a new task, and the factory transferred the original production tasks of the second group to our first group. At that time, our group also sent 15% of the workers to support drought relief in Changxi and other places. With fewer people and no additional equipment, our production tasks doubled. Could we complete this task? I organized the group members to study Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Mao Zedong Thought gave us strength and wisdom. Following Chairman Mao's guidance of "never engaging in battles without preparation and never fighting battles without confidence," we thoroughly prepared and, with a fearless revolutionary spirit, plunged into the production battle. As a result, we completed the production tasks of both groups for June and July ahead of schedule and beyond the target. This experience made me deeply realize that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force, an invincible and unstoppable power.

Chairman Mao's idea of turning every industry into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military training is our action guideline. To build this school, I believe the most important and fundamental step is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always prioritize proletarian politics, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our work, arming every person with Mao Zedong Thought.

    用毛泽东思想把每个工人武装起来
    工人　王泽喜
    毛主席关于把各行各业都办成亦工亦农亦文亦武的革命化大学校的指示太好了，太及时了，正合我们工人的心意。我坚决拥护、热烈响应毛主席的这一伟大号召，做一个亦工亦农、能文能武的新型工人。
    我过去想问题很狭窄，认为工人就是做工的，在车间里搞好生产，就是个好工人。通过学习毛主席著作，才认识到这种想法还很不够，还要立足车间看到全国全世界。我坚持天天学毛主席著作，眼界越来越开阔，思想越来越亮堂。凡是符合毛泽东思想的事，我就做；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的事，我就坚决反对。今年初，上级提出厂社结合，我们厂与清溪公社挂了钩，确定职工轮流下队当农民。我坚决拥护这项亦工亦农的措施，在没有轮到我去当农民以前，我就抽星期天下队去劳动，不仅学会了一般的农活，更重要的是密切了工农关系，进一步了解了贫农下中农对我们的要求，有利于我们改进工作，提高产品质量。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，我积极起来批判阶级敌人的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。同时，我还努力学习政治、军事和文化。
    我所做的这些，离毛主席的要求还差得很远，但已经深深感到自己思想起了很大变化。今年六月，钳工二组接受了新的任务，厂里把二组原来的生产任务全部交给我们一组。当时我们一组还抽了百分之十五的工人到苍溪等地支援抗旱。人少了，机器设备没有添，生产任务增大了一倍，能不能完成这个任务呢？我就组织组内同志带着问题学毛主席著作。毛泽东思想给我们增添了力量和智慧。我们根据毛主席“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”的指导思想，充分作好战斗准备，以大无畏的革命精神投入生产战斗，结果，提前超额完成了两个组六、七两月的生产任务。这一件事，使我又一次深刻认识到：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是最大的战斗力，是战无不胜、攻无不克的强大的力量。
    毛主席提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的思想，就是我们行动的纲领。要办好这个大学校，我认为最重要最根本的，就是要活学活用毛主席著作。要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想指导一切工作，用毛泽东思想把每个人武装起来。　　　　　　　（原载《四川日报》）
