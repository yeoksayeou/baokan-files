In recent days, the brave warriors of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team have reported to 650,000 revolutionary masses in the capital about their heroic deeds of fighting through fire and water under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought to protect the state and people's property. The heroes' report greatly aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses. They said: This is like attending the most vivid and lively political class on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They vowed to learn from the heroes' thoughts, follow the heroes' path, and create heroic deeds. They said they would definitely implement Comrade Lin Biao's recent instructions, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

After arriving in the capital, the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team received a warm welcome from the revolutionary masses of the capital. Wherever they went, the revolutionary masses greeted them with the most enthusiastic cheers: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Learn from the heroes!" "Salute to the heroes!" Every report was filled to capacity, and each report was frequently interrupted by enthusiastic applause. Many people wrote resolutions and poems on the spot, vowing to learn from the heroes and follow their path.

Those who attended the report included revolutionary workers, soldiers and officers of the PLA stationed in Beijing, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, Red Guards, and revolutionary teachers and students from the capital. There were also workers, peasants, and soldiers representatives from various ethnic minorities who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, as well as revolutionary teachers and students from various parts of the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary connections.

Now, the entire city has launched a wave of learning from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. Many factories, schools, and offices have broadcast the heroes' report recordings and organized listening to radio broadcasts. Workers in many workshops of the "June 7th" Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory (formerly the Longxing Station Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory) enthusiastically praised the heroic deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, saying that their deeds were the result of implementing Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, blood, and actions. Fire can burn steel and melt rocks, but it cannot destroy the heroes' red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They all expressed their determination to learn from the heroes and further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to deeply study and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, to seize the revolution and promote production, and to strive for double victories in the cultural revolution and production. Revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University also conducted learning and discussions. The _New Peking University_ magazine published a special issue on learning from the heroic drilling team, featuring articles and poems by revolutionary teachers and students sharing their learning experiences. Some Red Guards from Beijing No. 2 Middle School, who have been bravely fighting in the movement to criticize the old and establish the new, said that the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team is a good example for Red Guards to learn from. Only by being like them can one truly be worthy of being Chairman Mao's little red soldier.

Many revolutionary masses and revolutionary cultural workers have also compiled the heroes' deeds into various art forms such as dramas and folk arts, enthusiastically praising the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team.

The 32111 Heroic Drilling Team also received thousands of warm letters, telegrams, and precious gifts such as _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_ and Mao Zedong badges from revolutionary masses in the capital and various parts of the country.
