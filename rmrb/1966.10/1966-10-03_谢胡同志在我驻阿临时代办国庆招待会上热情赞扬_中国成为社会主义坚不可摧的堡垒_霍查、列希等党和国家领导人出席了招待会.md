	Xhehu said: "The friendship between our two peoples and parties is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and was established by the two parties led by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Hoxha. This friendship will last forever and will always be a source of inspiration for our two peoples in the construction of socialism and communism, and in the struggle against imperialism led by American imperialism and modern revisionism centered around the Khrushchev group in the Soviet Union."

The victory of the Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are events of great historical significance for all humanity.

At the same time, to further revolutionize all aspects of national life and to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China, they are further promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are happy for the achievements of the fraternal Chinese people and regard these achievements as our own." Xhehu said, "Great China has today become an indestructible bastion of socialism. It supports the struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, old and new colonialism, for freedom and independence. It is engaged in a head-on struggle with American imperialism, which seeks to dominate the world through aggression, and with modern revisionism centered around the Khrushchev group in the Soviet Union."

    据新华社地拉那一日电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办王锦川九月三十日晚在地拉那举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    出席招待会的有霍查、列希、谢胡、托斯卡、卡博、穆夫蒂乌、马尔科、阿利雅、科列加、凯莱齐等阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人以及各群众团体的负责人、人民军高级指挥员、工农兵代表、文艺界代表和各国驻阿尔巴尼亚外交使节以及正在阿尔巴尼亚访问的中阿友协代表团等。
    谢胡同志在招待会上讲话。他首先代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央、人民议会主席团和政府，向中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府致以最热烈的兄弟问候和最亲切的祝贺。
    谢胡说：“我们两国人民和两党之间的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的，是由以毛泽东同志和霍查同志为首的我们两党所缔造起来的。这种友谊将万古长青，并将永远是我们两国人民在社会主义和共产主义建设道路上、在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和以苏联赫鲁晓夫集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中的鼓舞力量。”
    谢胡说：“十月一日不仅是中国人民的伟大节日，而且也是阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界一切进步人民的节日，中国人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，是全人类具有重大的世界历史意义的事件。中国的伟大革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，有力地推进了世界革命事业，并成为被压迫人民争取自由、民族独立和进步的巨大的鼓舞力量。”
    他说：“兄弟的中国人民，遵循马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的学说，在生活的各个方面一直在不断革命的道路上胜利前进。今天，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正在胜利进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。同时，为了国家一切生活的进一步革命化，为了不致在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义，正在进一步开展无产阶级文化革命。我们为兄弟的中国人民所取得的成绩而高兴，并把这些成绩看作是我们的成绩。”谢胡说，伟大的中国，今天已经成为社会主义坚不可摧的堡垒。它支持各国人民反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义、争取自由和独立的斗争。它和企图以侵略手段称霸世界的美帝国主义以及以苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团为中心的现代修正主义进行着针锋相对的斗争。谢胡说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民完全支持中华人民共和国坚定不移的革命的外交政策。”
    在谢胡主席讲话之前，王锦川临时代办在招待会上讲了话。他概述了中国人民在毛主席英明领导下各个方面取得的伟大成就，并特就当前我国无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的形势和它的深远影响，作了详细的阐述。
    王锦川接着热烈颂扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，在反帝反修和在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就。他还指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和推进世界无产阶级革命事业，作出了卓越的贡献，赢得了全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的高度赞扬和尊敬。王锦川说，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所缔造的中阿友谊和团结是经得起任何考验的。不论世界上发生什么变化，我们将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起。
    谢胡和王锦川的讲话不断被热烈的掌声打断。
    整个招待会充满了极其热烈友好的气氛，宾主亲切交谈，并不断为中阿两国人民的革命友谊，为中阿两国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志和霍查同志的健康干杯。
