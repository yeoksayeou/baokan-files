Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's first slag brick factory, which uses slag as raw material, has been completed and officially started production in Shiquanshan City. Over the past few months, this factory has produced more than two million slag bricks, meeting the needs of local construction projects. Slag bricks are a new type of building material made from slag and limestone. Producing these bricks can make full use of industrial waste and does not occupy arable land.

    宁夏建成一座炉渣砖厂
    宁夏回族自治区第一座利用炉渣作原料的制砖厂，已在石咀山市建成并且正式投产。这个厂几个月来已经生产了二百多万块炉渣砖，供应当地建筑工程的需要。炉渣砖是利用炉渣和石灰石作原料制成的一种新型建筑材料。生产这种砖，可以充分利用工业废料，不占用农田好土。
