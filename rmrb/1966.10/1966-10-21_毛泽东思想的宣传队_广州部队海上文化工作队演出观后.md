The Guangzhou Military District's Sea-Based Cultural Work Team was established in the new situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, in accordance with Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought. It is a revolutionary and combat-ready literary and artistic vanguard. Since its establishment, it has always faced the company, learned from the soldiers, and served the soldiers, forging itself into a genuine work team, service team, and propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought. It has been warmly welcomed and praised by the soldiers of the company and the broad masses of workers and peasants.

They regard the praise of Mao Zedong Thought as their fundamental task. After watching their performance, we were deeply moved and received great education and encouragement.

The duet "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought," the solo "The Great Leader's Voyage on the Yangtze River," "Chairman Mao is with Us," the duet "Let Us Sing of Mao Zedong," and the choral poem "Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the World" are all filled with proletarian revolutionary passion, with thunderous and powerful voices, using the newest and most beautiful language to praise our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are full of fiery class feelings, expressing the soldiers' boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and also expressing the voice of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. They sing with such fervor that the hearts of workers, peasants, and soldiers are filled with warmth, and the hearts of class enemies tremble with fear!

The short performance "The Platoon Leader and I Play Table Tennis" is a song of praise for the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought. It tells the story of a platoon leader who, using the method of personal example, competes in table tennis with a soldier, cleverly inspiring the soldier to realize that his bayonet skills are not solid, the key being that he does not emphasize politics, and first of all, his ideology is not solid. This short performance is novel in form, has a clear rhythm, is lively and vivid, and is witty and charming. It successfully portrays the image of a grassroots military cadre who emphasizes politics and is good at grasping living thoughts, reflecting the life of our army that is united, tense, serious, and lively, and the brotherly relationship among comrades. This is the result of the cultural work team's deep involvement in the grassroots, insistence on serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and insistence on emphasizing politics. They themselves say well: "We insist on emphasizing politics at all times, in all things, and in all places, infusing politics into our thoughts, lives, rehearsals, and stages, into every note and every dance movement. In this way, our art has direction, soul, and power."

The Guangzhou Military District's Sea-Based Cultural Work Team has inherited and carried forward the fighting style of the old Red Army propaganda team, breaking through some of the old artistic conventions. The performers are versatile, writing and performing their own works, with a light and agile performance team that can march with their backpacks and perform when they put down their backpacks, wholeheartedly serving the people. They faithfully carry out the direction of Mao Zedong's literature and art and are a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛泽东思想的宣传队
    ——广州部队海上文化工作队演出观后
    中国人民解放军某部　施存康
    广州部队海上文化工作队是在无产阶级文化大革命新形势下，按照毛主席的文艺思想建立起来的一支革命化战斗化的文艺轻骑队。建队以来一直面向连队，向兵学习，为兵服务，锻炼成为一支名副其实的工作队、服务队和毛泽东思想的宣传队，受到了连队战士和广大工农群众的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    他们把歌颂毛泽东思想，当作自己的根本任务。看了他们的演出，我们的心里激动得很，受到极大的教育和鼓舞。
    对口词《毛泽东思想万岁》，独唱《伟大的领袖畅游长江》，《毛主席和我们在一起》，二重唱《听我们歌唱毛泽东》，诗歌联唱《毛泽东思想照亮全球》等节目，都是满怀无产阶级革命激情，以风雷震荡的最强音，用最新最美的语言，歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。它们充满了火热的阶级感情的声音，唱出了我们战士对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚的心声，也唱出了亿万革命人民的心声，唱得工农兵心里热气腾腾，唱得阶级敌人胆战心惊！
    小演唱《连长和我打乒乓球》是一曲活学活用毛泽东思想的颂歌。写的是一位连长用现身说法的办法，找一位战士比赛乒乓球，巧妙地启发这位战士觉悟到自己刺杀技术不过硬，关键在于没有突出政治，首先是思想不过硬。这个小节目，形式新颖，节奏明快，生动活泼，风趣动人。它成功地塑造了一位突出政治、善于抓活思想的基层军事干部的形象，反映了我们部队团结紧张严肃活泼的生活和亲如兄弟的同志关系。这是文化工作队深入基层，坚持为工农兵服务的方向，坚持突出政治的结果。他们自己说得好：“我们坚持时时、事事、处处突出政治，把政治贯注到思想里、生活里，贯注到排演场、舞台上，贯注到每一个音符、每一个舞蹈动作里。这样，我们的艺术就有了方向，有了灵魂，有了力量。”
    广州部队海上文化工作队继承和发扬了老红军宣传队的战斗作风，打破了旧文艺的一些条条框框。演员一专多能，自编自演，演出队伍轻装精干，打起背包能走，放下背包能演，全心全意为人民服务。他们忠实地贯彻了毛泽东文艺方向，是一支毛泽东思想的宣传队。
