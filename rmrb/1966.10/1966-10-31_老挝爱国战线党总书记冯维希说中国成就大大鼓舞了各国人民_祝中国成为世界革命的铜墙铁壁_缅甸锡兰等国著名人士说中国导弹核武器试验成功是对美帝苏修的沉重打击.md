Lao People's Revolutionary Party General Secretary Phoumi Vongvichit says China's achievements greatly inspire people of all countries
Wishes China to become the iron wall of the world revolution
Notable figures from Burma, Ceylon and other countries say China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests are a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism

According to Xinhua News Agency, notable figures and the public from various Asian countries have enthusiastically praised China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests as a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism of the Lao Patriotic United Government, and the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, Phoumi Vongvichit, the head of the Military Command of the Neutralist Forces, Colonel Than, and the head of the Political Department of the Lao People's Liberation Army, and others, with hearts full of excitement, visited the Chinese Economic and Cultural Mission in Laos to express their warm congratulations.

Phoumi Vongvichit, on behalf of the two patriotic forces of Laos and the people of Xieng Khouang Province, spoke. He said: This successful missile and nuclear weapon test is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great achievement created by the Chinese people through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

He said, this successful test, "has set a brilliant example for the people of all countries to build national defense and develop economy and culture through self-reliance. This nuclear test not only strengthens China's own national defense but is also a powerful force for safeguarding world peace, greatly inspiring the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, especially supporting our Lao people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation." Phoumi Vongvichit also pointed out that this nuclear test is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism.

Phoumi Vongvichit finally wished the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, good health, and wished the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, continuous progress in socialist construction and national defense, to become the iron wall of the world revolution; wished the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, to become stronger and stronger, and wished the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to be a complete success.

Dr. U Thant, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, said: "The Chinese people were able to successfully launch missiles and nuclear weapons in such a short time, which is due to the successful application of Chairman Mao's thoughts in scientific experiments." He said: "This is a very heavy blow to U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and all reactionaries in the world."

The leader of the Ceylon National Liberation Front, Basil de Silva, warmly congratulated China on the successful missile and nuclear weapon tests. He said, China's successful test, "undoubtedly shows that the revolutionary Chinese people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought are creating miracles."

He pointed out that China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests are a heavy blow to the global conspiracy being plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

On October 29, the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shukeiri, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Cairo. He said: "The Palestinian people, under the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization, are very happy about the great achievements of the Chinese people." "We sincerely congratulate Chairman Mao because his thoughts and teachings have brought about this great achievement. We also, through Comrade Lin Biao, congratulate the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their tremendous efforts in achieving this remarkable feat."

Shukeiri pointed out: "China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests have broken the U.S. monopoly on nuclear strategy, technology, and science."

He said, China's great achievement, "greatly inspires the Palestinian people and the people of the world who are in the struggle. We are happy that this Asian giant, China, has proven that the Asian and African peoples can contribute to the defense of world peace and security. The Palestine Liberation Organization, at this historic moment, says to the Chinese people, we look forward to your greater achievements."

The Chairman of the Syrian General Federation of Trade Unions, Khaled Junadi, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that China is the most resolute country in opposing imperialism. China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests have made imperialism very afraid, but have greatly supported the oppressed peoples, and is a great victory for the world people's anti-imperialist struggle.

    缅甸缅中友好协会主席信波博士说：“中国人民能在这样短的时间内成功地发射了导弹核武器，这是由于在科学实验中成功地运用了毛主席的思想。”他说：“这是对美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者和世界上的一切反动派的非常沉重的打击。”

    舒凯里指出：“中国导弹核武器试验成功，已经打破了美国对核战略技术和科学的垄断。”
    他说，中国这一伟大成就，“大大地鼓舞了正在斗争中的巴勒斯坦人民和世界人民。我们感到高兴的是，中国这个亚洲大国已经证明：亚非人民能够对保卫世界的和平与安全作出贡献。巴勒斯坦解放组织在这个具有历史意义的时刻向中国人民说，我们期待着你们取得更大的成就。”
