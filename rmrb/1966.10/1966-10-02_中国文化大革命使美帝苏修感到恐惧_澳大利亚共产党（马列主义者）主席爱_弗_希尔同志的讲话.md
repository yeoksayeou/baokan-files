The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has caused fear in the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

The Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), Comrade E.F. Hill, delivered a speech at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Comrades,

The Marxist-Leninists of Australia extend our congratulations on the national day of China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which takes Mao Zedong Thought as its guide, China has, after a long struggle, achieved liberation. This is the direct continuation of the great October Revolution, led by Lenin, which has now been shamefully betrayed by Khrushchev and his successors. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has advanced the Chinese revolution. The socialist revolution in China has caused the reactionaries, especially US imperialism and modern revisionism headed by the Soviet leadership, to tremble with fear. The US imperialists and Soviet revisionists regard China as their sworn enemy precisely because China is the most resolute defender of socialism. Because the Soviet revisionists have betrayed Lenin and the October Revolution, they are enraged and are plotting against the Chinese people. They shamelessly form an unholy "holy alliance" with US imperialism, attempting to subvert China from within and attack it from without. They vilely coordinate their anti-China, counter-revolutionary, and anti-national liberation plans. They attempt to strangle the heroic Vietnamese people and to strangle China's resolute support for the Vietnamese people, shamelessly carrying out their filthy counter-revolutionary plots. The notorious so-called "united action of socialist countries" cannot deceive any serious person. The Vietnamese people will surely win. The US-Soviet collusion plans will all fail, and will continue to fail. The idea of isolating China and defeating the Vietnamese people is a pipe dream of paper tigers. No matter how hard the US imperialists and Soviet revisionists try, China will never be isolated. The Chinese people, armed with the immortal Mao Zedong Thought, are indestructible. Their cause is inseparable from the cause of the working people of the whole world. Today's celebration is also a celebration of the people of the whole world opposing the weak enemies, US imperialism and Soviet revisionism. October 1st is indeed an international holiday.

Long live the victory of the Chinese revolution!

Long live proletarian internationalism!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    中国文化大革命使美帝苏修感到恐惧
    澳大利亚共产党（马列主义者）主席爱·弗·希尔同志的讲话
    新华社一日讯　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席爱·弗·希尔同志在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：同志们：
    澳大利亚的马克思列宁主义者对中国的国庆表示祝贺。中国是在以毛泽东思想为指针的中国共产党的领导下，经过长期的斗争，才获得解放的。这是列宁所领导的、而如今已被赫鲁晓夫及其继任者无耻地出卖了的伟大的十月革命的直接继续。无产阶级文化大革命推进了中国的革命。中国的社会主义革命，使反动派，特别使美帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义感到恐惧。美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者之所以把中国看成是他们的死敌，就是因为中国是社会主义最坚决的维护者。正因为苏联修正主义者背叛了列宁和十月革命，所以他们老羞成怒，阴谋反对中国人民。他们肆无忌惮地同美国帝国主义结成非神圣的“神圣同盟”，企图对中国从内部进行颠覆，从外面举行进攻。他们卑鄙地把彼此的反华、反革命和反民族解放的计划配合起来。他们企图扼杀英雄的越南人民、扼杀中国对越南人民的坚决支持，这是无耻地实行他们的肮脏的反革命阴谋。臭名昭著的所谓“社会主义国家联合行动”，欺骗不了任何严肃的人们。越南人民必胜。美苏合谋计划统统遭到了失败，今后还将遭到失败。孤立中国、打败越南人民，这是纸老虎的痴心梦想。不管美帝国主义和苏联修正主义如何费尽心机，中国是永远孤立不了的。以不朽的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，是不可摧毁的。他们的事业同全世界劳动人民的事业是分不开的。今天的庆祝活动也是全世界人民反对虚弱的敌人美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的庆祝活动。十月一日确实是一个国际性的节日。
    中国革命胜利万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
