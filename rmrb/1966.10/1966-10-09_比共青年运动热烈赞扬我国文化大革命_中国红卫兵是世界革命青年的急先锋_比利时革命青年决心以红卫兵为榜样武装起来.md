The National Executive Committee of the Belgian Communist Youth Movement has passed a resolution warmly praising the Chinese Red Guards as the "vanguard of the world's revolutionary youth." This resolution was published in the October 7 issue of the Belgian Communist Party's weekly newspaper, *The Voice of the People*.

The resolution begins: "The National Executive Committee of the Belgian Communist Youth Movement warmly salutes the Chinese people who are resolutely carrying out the socialist cultural revolution, the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the glorious revolutionary youth. We particularly salute the extremely revolutionary and extremely correct Bolshevik actions of the Red Guards. The Red Guards, who are loyal to the revolutionary traditions of the older generation and take the glorious People's Liberation Army as their example, have truly become a new tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat and a particularly effective vanguard of the Chinese people who are determined to carry the revolution through to the end. By constantly studying the thoughts of Mao Zedong—the contemporary Lenin—and by thoroughly carrying out the Party's directives, especially the sixteen-point decision of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee, and by serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Red Guards have indeed aroused the enthusiasm of revolutionary youth throughout the world."

The resolution emphasizes: "Just look at how the American imperialists and their main accomplices, the Soviet revisionists and their lackeys, have been frantically anti-China and anti-communist in recent weeks. Just look at the despicable slanders and fears of all the parties and individuals participating in the government of our country. This shows that our Chinese comrades have hit the mark.

"China is now red and will always be red in the future."

The resolution states: "The National Executive Committee of the Belgian Communist Youth Movement warmly thanks the revolutionary youth of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong for setting such an outstanding example for us. Although we are far apart, we feel so close to our Chinese comrades! We feel that, thanks to their example of struggle, we have been better armed."

The resolution expresses that the Belgian Communist Youth Movement will, under the strong leadership of the Belgian Communist Party and Comrade Griva, further intensify the struggle to resist American reactionary culture with proletarian culture and to make the youth fully understand the universal significance of the current socialist cultural revolution in China. The resolution concludes with the slogans: "Long live the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao! Long live the Red Guards, the vanguard of the world's revolutionary youth! Long live the combat unity between Chinese youth and Belgian youth against American imperialism and modern revisionism! Long live the unity of Marxist-Leninist youth!"

    比共青年运动热烈赞扬我国文化大革命
    中国红卫兵是世界革命青年的急先锋
    比利时革命青年决心以红卫兵为榜样武装起来
    据新华社布鲁塞尔七日电　比利时共产主义青年运动全国执行局通过一项决议，热烈赞扬中国红卫兵是“世界革命青年的急先锋”。这个决议刊登在七日的比利时共产党《人民之声》周刊上。
    决议一开头写道：“比利时共产主义青年运动全国执行局热烈地向正在坚决进行社会主义文化大革命的中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党以及光荣的革命青年致敬。我们特别向红卫兵的非常革命和非常正确的布尔什维克的行动致敬。忠于老一辈的革命传统和以光荣的人民解放军为榜样的红卫兵，已经真正成为无产阶级专政的新的工具，成为要把革命进行到底的中国人民群众的特别有效的急先锋。由于经常学习毛泽东——当代的列宁——的思想，彻底执行共产党的指示、特别是最近一次中央委员会全体会议的十六条决定，并且为广大工农兵群众服务，红卫兵确实激起了全世界革命青年的热情。”
    决议强调：“只要看看美帝国主义和它的主要同谋苏联修正主义者及其走狗之流最近几个星期疯狂地反华反共，只要看看我们国家里所有参加政府的党派和人士的卑鄙诬蔑及其恐惧，就可以知道，我们中国同志打中了要害。
    “中国现在是红色的，将来也将始终是红色的。”
    决议写道：“比利时共产主义青年运动全国执行局热烈感谢中国革命青年、中国共产党和毛泽东同志给他们树立了杰出的榜样。虽然我们相隔很远，但是我们感到同我们的中国同志是多么亲近！我们感到，由于他们斗争的榜样，我们已经更好地武装起来。”
    决议表示，比利时共产主义青年运动将在比利时共产党和格里巴同志的坚强领导下，进一步展开斗争，以无产阶级文化来抵制美国的反动文化，使青年群众充分了解当前中国社会主义文化大革命的带普遍性的重要意义。决议最后欢呼：“中华人民共和国、中国共产党、毛泽东主席万岁！”“世界革命青年的急先锋红卫兵万岁！”“中国青年和比利时青年之间反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的战斗团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义的青年团结起来！”
