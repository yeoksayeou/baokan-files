Chairman Mao rode in an open-top car to the front of our formation. My heart was filled with immense excitement, and I was immersed in a great sense of happiness. I was very close to Chairman Mao and saw him very clearly. Chairman Mao's health is so good, which is the greatest happiness for every revolutionary person and revolutionary soldier!

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts, you are the beacon of human liberation. It is you who have always guided the direction of the revolution, leading our people from one victory to another. Your brilliant works are the banners of liberation. By studying your works, my eyes have been enlightened, my heart has broadened, my fighting spirit has been strengthened, and I have learned how to be a person and how to sail forward on the path of life with victory.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I have countless words to say to you. But no matter how many words I use, I cannot express my boundless excitement. Even if I used all the water from the three rivers and five lakes, I still could not express my admiration for you. I pledge to you: I will actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will be a good soldier of yours. I will set a high standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" for myself, be a diligent ox for the people, and always obey the people's commands. I will strive together with all the people of the nation, turn barren mountains into orchards, turn deserts into granaries, and make our motherland an iron fortress.

    唱不完的幸福歌
    毛主席乘着敞篷汽车，来到我们队伍的前面。我的心情万分激动，沉浸在巨大的幸福之中。我和毛主席相距很近，非常清楚地看到了毛主席。毛主席的身体这样健康，这是我们每一个革命人民和革命战士的最大幸福！
    敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中最红最红的太阳，您是人类解放的灯塔。是您始终掌握着革命的航向，使我国人民从胜利走向胜利。您的光辉著作是解放的旗帜，学习了您的著作，使我眼睛明亮了，胸怀宽阔了，斗志增强了，使我懂得了怎样做人，怎样在生活的道路上，扬起风帆胜利前进。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，我有千言万语要对您讲。可是，千言万语道不出我无比激动的心情，就是用尽三江五湖的水，也写不尽对您的爱戴。我向您保证：我一定积极地响应林彪同志的号召，读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我一定以“完全”“彻底”的高标准严格要求自己，做一头人民的老黄牛，永远听劳动人民的使唤。我一定和全国人民一道共同奋斗，让荒山变成果园，让沙漠变成米粮川，让祖国成为铁打江山。
