In celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the leaders of our country have received congratulatory telegrams from many countries and regions.

Telegram from the Party and State Leaders of Albania

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, Enver Hoxha, the Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, Haxhi Lleshi, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, Mehmet Shehu, stated in their telegram: "In the short period since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the heroic and talented Chinese people, under the correct Marxist-Leninist leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant victories of historic significance in socialist construction, transforming their motherland into a powerful socialist country with advanced intensive agriculture, modern industry, revolutionary culture, and continuously developing science. The Third Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture opens up new horizons for the fraternal Chinese people to achieve even greater achievements.

"The People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation among all peoples, bravely and firmly opposing the war and aggression policies of imperialism led by the United States, sincerely and wholeheartedly supporting and aiding the oppressed peoples in their struggle for freedom and national independence, and opposing imperialism and colonialism. It has provided substantial aid to the fraternal Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle against the criminal aggression of the United States and its lackeys, becoming a reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people. Great People's China has become a decisive factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. It has won the boundless love and great respect of all peoples of the world striving for freedom, independence, peace, and socialism through its correct policies.

"The glorious Communist Party of China, guided by the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, has made historic contributions to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism in the past and present. It is waging an uncompromising, persistent, and principled struggle against modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party traitors. It has become a great example inspiring all communists and revolutionaries in the world, a powerful revolutionary pillar, and an impregnable fortress.

"A great, unbreakable, and eternal friendship binds the Albanian people with the great Chinese people. This friendship was forged and tempered by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and is continually strengthened in the common struggle to build socialism and achieve our sacred cause—the victory of socialism and communism.

"The Albanian people and their Party are proud to stand with the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China. The Chinese people and the Communist Party of China are our loyal comrades-in-arms in our struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, the modern revisionists. Our people are genuinely happy about the great victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people and regard them as our own victories. We sincerely wish the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, new and even more brilliant victories on the glorious path of socialism and communism for their motherland."

The Vietnamese people firmly believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, illuminated by the brilliant light of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people will certainly over-fulfill the Third Five-Year Plan and achieve even greater victories in class struggle, production struggle, scientific experimentation, and the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"The long-standing, close, and inseparable brotherly friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China will be further consolidated in the struggle against our common enemy—American imperialism. In the past struggle against the French colonialists and in the current socialist construction and anti-American national salvation struggle, the Vietnamese people have consistently received the immense sympathy, support, and aid of the Communist Party of China and the fraternal Chinese people, imbued with proletarian internationalism. This support and aid have greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors, defend socialist North Vietnam, liberate the South, and achieve national reunification.

Congratulatory Letter from the General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association

The leaders of our country received congratulatory letters from the General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Chawdhuri, and the Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau, Senanayake, on the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Chawdhuri stated in his letter: "The 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is celebrated at a time when the great Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, are carrying out a great revolutionary movement in all aspects of socialist construction and achieving great successes. The great achievements of China's socialist construction and the consolidation of revolutionary fruits are highly admired by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, as well as all progressive peoples of the world. Today, People's China is the helm of the world socialist revolution and an outstanding and inspiring example for all those who follow the socialist path.

"Internationally, all political forces are experiencing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization. Although there are inevitable twists and turns on the road to development, the overall trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards world victory is unchangeable. The People's Republic of China has consistently adhered to the policy of proletarian internationalism, firmly supporting the revolutionary peoples of the world, especially the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and maintaining a principled, revolutionary, and anti-imperialist stance. This has made the People's Republic of China deeply loved by the fighting peoples of the three continents from the bottom of their hearts. This situation has caused imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to shout and oppose, but it has made the anti-imperialist forces of the world love People's China even more."

Congratulatory Letter from the Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau

Senanayake stated in his letter: "We Asian-African writers, the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa, and all revolutionary peoples of the world regard the founding of the People's Republic of China 17 years ago as a historic and most important event since the end of World War II. The founding of the People's Republic of China not only fundamentally changed the balance of power in Asia but also fundamentally changed the balance of power in the entire world.

"Now, China, as a great socialist country, stands firmly at the forefront of the struggle against world imperialism led by the United States and provides the most steadfast support to all the fighting peoples of the world. Under the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the Chinese people have already achieved great victories and made remarkable achievements. The peoples of Asia and Africa and the peoples of the world are delighted by these great achievements of the Chinese people and regard them as their own victories.

"The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, unprecedented in history, that the Chinese people have launched in recent months is a great revolutionary movement that has promoted China's socialist cause, thoroughly eliminated all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that have poisoned the people for thousands of years, and established new socialist ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits among the broad masses of the people. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution justly and correctly guides the people to attack a handful of counter-revolutionaries who stubbornly oppose socialism and take the capitalist road. Therefore, the social basis of imperialism, all exploiting classes, and finally but also importantly—modern revisionism has been thoroughly destroyed. It is precisely for this reason that imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries hate and fear China's cultural revolution. On the contrary, all the peoples of the world cheer and praise this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further ensures that China will continue to stand at the forefront of the world anti-imperialist struggle, continue to be the strongest pillar and fortress of the world people, and continue to be the center of the world revolution.

"All these achievements are due to the brilliant, brilliant, and correct leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, the sun that never sets in the hearts of all revolutionaries and progressives of the world—Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao has armed the people struggling against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and all reactionaries for complete national independence with the most powerful weapon—Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has shown the people of the world the road to victory. The most advanced, most comprehensive, and most contemporary revolutionary theory, Mao Zedong Thought, is the greatest contribution to all the peoples of the world."

    亚非记协总书记查禾多的贺信
    新华社三十日讯　我国领导人收到了亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多以及亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克祝贺中华人民共和国成立十七周年的信件。
      查禾多在信中说：“中华人民共和国成立十七周年是在这样的时候庆祝的，即：伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个方面开展了伟大的革命运动，并取得了巨大的成就。中国社会主义建设的伟大成就和革命果实的巩固，是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民以至于全世界的进步人民所高度钦佩的。今天，人民中国是世界社会主义革命的舵手，是所有走社会主义道路的人们的杰出的、鼓舞人心的榜样。
    “在国际上，各种政治力量都在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。尽管在发展的道路上不可避免地会有曲折和反复，但是，帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的总趋势，是改变不了的。中华人民共和国一贯遵循无产阶级国际主义的政策，坚定不移地支持世界革命人民，特别是支持亚、非、拉的革命人民，坚持原则性的、革命的、反帝的立场，这就使中华人民共和国受到我们三大洲战斗着的人民发自内心的深切爱戴。这种情况引起帝国主义者、修正主义者和反动派大叫大嚷地反对，但这却使世界反帝力量更加爱戴人民中国。”
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克的贺信
    森纳那亚克在信中说：“我们亚非作家，战斗中的亚非人民和全世界所有爱国的革命的人民，把十七年前中华人民共和国的成立看成是第二次世界大战以后的一个具有历史意义的、最重要的事件。中华人民共和国的成立不仅根本改变了亚洲的力量对比，而且也根本改变了整个世界的力量对比。
    “现在，中国作为一个伟大的社会主义国家，正坚定地站在反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义的最前列，并且最坚持不渝地给予全世界战斗中的人民以真正的支援。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指导下，中国人民已经取得了伟大的胜利，获得了惊人的成就。亚非人民和世界人民为中国人民的这些伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞，并把这些成就看作是他们自己的胜利。
    “中国人民近几个月来所开展的无产阶级文化大革命这一史无前例的运动，是一个伟大的革命运动，它推动了中国的社会主义事业，彻底破除几千年来剥削阶级毒害人民的一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在广大人民群众中树立崭新的社会主义新思想、新文化、新风俗和新习惯。这场无产阶级文化大革命公正而正确地引导人民向一小撮拚死地反对社会主义和走资本主义道路的反革命分子进攻。因此，帝国主义、一切剥削阶级和最后但也是重要的——现代修正主义的社会基础被彻底摧毁。正因为这样，帝国主义、现代修正主义和世界各国反动派仇视和痛恨中国的文化革命这是显而易见的。与此相反，全世界人民欢呼赞扬这场无产阶级文化大革命。中国的无产阶级文化大革命进一步保证中国将继续站在世界反帝斗争的前列，继续成为世界人民最强大的支柱和堡垒，继续成为世界革命的中心。
    “所有这些成就都应归功于中国人民的伟大领袖、世界一切革命者和进步人们心中不落的太阳——毛泽东主席的英明、光辉和正确的领导。毛主席用最强大的武器——毛泽东思想武装了为反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和一切反动派，争取完全民族独立而斗争的人民。毛主席为全世界人民指出了胜利的道路。当代最伟大、最先进、最全面的革命理论毛泽东思想，是对全世界人民的最伟大的贡献。”
