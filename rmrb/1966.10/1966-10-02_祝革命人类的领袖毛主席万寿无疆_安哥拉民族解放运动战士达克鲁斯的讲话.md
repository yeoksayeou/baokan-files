	The following is the full text of the speech by Dakru of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China:

	First of all, please allow me to convey the militant greetings of the revolutionary people of Angola to the great revolutionary people of China and to the Red Guards. The Red Guards, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China, are making great contributions to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This revolution will have a tremendous impact on the world revolution.

	The Chinese people regard the victories of the African people as their own victories. Similarly, the brilliant victories of the Chinese revolution have made an incalculable contribution to the heroic struggle of the African people, who have consistently fought against old and new colonialism to win and maintain national independence.

	The Chinese revolution has been self-reliant and relentless, steadily advancing. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution once again brilliantly demonstrates the firm, tenacious, and thorough revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people.

	The People's Republic of China enjoys ever-increasing prestige among the peoples of all countries and is becoming stronger and stronger both materially and spiritually. It has now become a stronghold for the peoples of all countries who are simultaneously fighting against the common enemy of mankind—the savage U.S. imperialism and the number one running dog of U.S. imperialism—modern revisionism.

	Comrades and friends!

	The key to the continuous victories of the Chinese people lies undoubtedly in the leadership of the great, invincible Chairman Mao Zedong.

	Practice has proved that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest embodiment of living Marxism-Leninism.

	Mao Zedong Thought, which is increasingly grasped by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is defeating, through the actual struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the biggest reactionary alliance in history—the alliance composed of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism.

	The revolutionary people of China are the vanguard of the world revolution, and Mao Zedong Thought is the powerful beacon guiding the world revolution.

	Comrades and friends!

	The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly achieve even greater victories in all fields. In this way, the Chinese people will be able to support the national liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the heroic and victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression, even more powerfully.

	Comrades and friends!

	The Soviet revisionists are trying to dominate the world together with U.S. imperialism. Therefore, they are ruthlessly carrying out capitalist restoration in socialist countries and using two-faced methods to ensure that colonialism and imperialism remain forever in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Similarly, they are trying to impose so-called "peace talks" on the Vietnamese people, with the sole aim of keeping U.S. imperialism in Vietnam in one way or another.

	Comrades and friends!

	If the peoples of all countries do not fight against U.S. imperialism and completely defeat it, U.S. imperialism will not perish. To thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism, the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world must continuously expand and strengthen the international united front against the main pillar of world reactionary forces—U.S. imperialism. Obviously, the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, especially the Soviet revisionist clique, cannot be included in this united front.

	The international united front led by the Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and sweep away old and new colonialism from the earth.

	Long live the People's Republic of China!

	Long live the great Chinese people!

	Long live the revolutionary peoples of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the whole world!

	Long live the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!

	Long live the beacon of the world revolution, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great and glorious leader of the revolutionary people of the world, forever!

### 祝革命人类的领袖毛主席万寿无疆  安哥拉民族解放运动战士达克鲁斯的讲话

    祝革命人类的领袖毛主席万寿无疆
    安哥拉民族解放运动战士达克鲁斯的讲话
    新华社一日讯　安哥拉民族解放运动战士达克鲁斯在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    首先，请允许我向伟大的中国革命人民、向红卫兵转达安哥拉革命人民的战斗敬礼。红卫兵正在和中国广大的工农兵群众一道，为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利作出贡献，这一革命将对世界革命发生巨大的作用。
    中国人民把非洲人民的胜利看作是自己的胜利，同样，中国革命的辉煌胜利也对非洲人民一贯为反对新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立而进行的英勇斗争，作出了不可估量的贡献。
    中国革命自力更生，前赴后继，一直向前推进。当前的无产阶级文化大革命再一次光辉地证明，中国人民具有坚定的、顽强的和彻底的革命精神。
    中华人民共和国在世界各国人民中享有越来越高的威望，在物质上和精神上日益强大，现在已经成为正在同时反对人类的共同敌人——野蛮的美帝国主义和美帝国主义的头号帮凶——现代修正主义的世界各国人民的坚强堡垒。
    同志们，朋友们！
    中国人民不断胜利前进的关键是伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东主席思想的领导，这显然是肯定无疑的。
    实践证明，毛泽东思想是活的马克思列宁主义的最高体现。
    越来越为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民所掌握的毛泽东思想，通过亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的实际斗争，正在打败有史以来最大的反动联盟——由美帝国主义和现代修正主义所组成的联盟。
    革命的中国人民是世界革命的先锋，毛泽东思想是指导世界革命的强大灯塔。
    同志们，朋友们！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民一定会在各方面的工作中取得更为巨大的成就。这样，中国人民将会更有力地支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，特别是越南人民反对美国侵略的英勇的、胜利的斗争。
    同志们，朋友们！
    苏联修正主义者企图同美帝国主义共同主宰世界。因此，他们穷凶极恶地在社会主义国家实行资本主义复辟，采用两面手法使殖民主义和帝国主义永远留在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。同样，他们企图把所谓的“和谈”强加给越南人民，其目的无非是使美帝国主义在这种或那种方式下留在越南而已。
    同志们，朋友们！
    如果世界各国人民不和美帝国主义进行斗争，把它完全打败，美帝国主义是不会灭亡的。要彻底战胜美帝国主义，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民就必须不断扩大和加强反对世界反动势力的主要支柱美帝国主义的国际统一战线。显然，美帝国主义的仆从，特别是苏联修正主义集团，不能包括在这个统一战线之内。
    以用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民为首的国际统一战线必定能够战胜美帝国主义及其仆从，从地球上横扫新老殖民主义。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界的革命人民万岁！
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利万岁！
    世界革命的灯塔、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    祝革命人类的无限光荣的、伟大的革命领袖毛泽东万寿无疆！
