This year, as we stand in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and as our socialist revolution enters a new, deeper, and broader stage, we celebrate the glorious National Day. This is an extraordinary day, a day of unprecedented revolutionary spirit, a day of great joy and inspiration.

The seventeen years since the founding of the People's Republic of China have been seventeen years of great strides forward under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the realms of politics, economics, military affairs, and culture, we have achieved extraordinarily brilliant successes. Our achievements have won the enthusiastic praise of revolutionary people all over the world, striking fear into the hearts of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. The socialist New China stands tall in the East, bringing about a tremendous change in the revolutionary struggle of the entire world.

How were these great achievements of the past seventeen years attained? The fundamental experience we have gained can be summed up in one point: what Chairman Mao has said, that is, to grasp firmly the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Our victories are victories of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, victories of the socialist road over the capitalist road.

In his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in March 1949, Chairman Mao pointed out that after the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide and the resolution of the land problem, the basic contradiction within the country was that between the working class and the bourgeoisie. This means that the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie runs through the entire historical process of socialism and permeates all aspects of socialist society.

Seventeen years of history have proven that wherever and whenever we have grasped this fundamental line of struggle between the two classes and the two roads, our proletarian revolutionary cause has advanced, flourished, and thrived. Wherever and whenever we have deviated from this line, we have encountered evil tendencies, lost our way, and suffered setbacks.

In January 1965, at a national work conference convened by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong told us:

Throughout the entire transitional period, there exist class contradictions, there exists the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there exists the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. To forget this fundamental theory and practice of our Party over the past decade or more would lead us astray.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage in the struggle between the two classes and the two roads.

This Cultural Revolution involves a broad scope. We must sweep away all monsters and demons, smash the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes in the ideological realm, and establish the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat. This will inevitably affect the political and economic life of society. This Cultural Revolution aims to strike down a handful of bourgeois rightists and those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The struggle between the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, on the one hand, and a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, on the other, is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, in the present stage.

Why do there exist those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road? This is determined by the law of class struggle. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the overthrown exploiting classes always try to corrupt Communist Party cadres in various ways and seek their agents within the Party. At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao taught us that we must be on guard against the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie. This is a warning bell to all Communist Party members. The vast majority of Communist Party members have withstood this test. However, a handful have been hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. They are no longer representatives of the proletariat but representatives of the bourgeoisie.

Those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are a handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. They are of the same ilk as Khrushchev. Given the opportunity, they will conspire to usurp the Party, the army, and the government. They are our most dangerous and principal enemies. The overthrown exploiting classes pin their hopes of restoration mainly on them. The activities of the exploiting classes aimed at restoration are mainly carried out by them or under their protection. Therefore, only by overthrowing those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road can we smash the schemes of the exploiting classes for restoration, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and promote the development of socialist causes.

The "Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, that is, the Sixteen Articles, is the product of the struggle between the two lines. It is the product of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the bourgeois reactionary line. The publication of the Sixteen Articles has won the enthusiastic support of the broad revolutionary masses and has pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high tide. The revolutionary situation is excellent and getting better and better.

However, the struggle between the two lines has not ended. In some places and units, the struggle between the two lines is still sharp and complex. A very few people adopt new forms to deceive the masses, resist the Sixteen Articles, stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, and try to achieve their purposes by inciting the masses to fight against the masses.

The bourgeois reactionary line must be thoroughly criticized. Only by thoroughly criticizing it and eliminating its influence can we carry out the proletarian Sixteen Articles, conduct the struggle, criticism, and transformation in society, schools, and other cultural departments under the correct line, clarify what to struggle against, what to criticize, and what to transform, clarify who to rely on to struggle, who to criticize, and who to transform, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. If we continue the past erroneous line, repeat the mistake of suppressing the masses, continue to incite students to fight against students, and do not liberate the revolutionary masses who have been persecuted in the past, and so on, that would be to resist and sabotage the Sixteen Articles. Under such circumstances, how can we correctly conduct the struggle, criticism, and transformation?

Whether or not to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line is the key to whether we can carry out the Sixteen Articles of the Cultural Revolution and correctly conduct the broad struggle, criticism, and transformation. Here, we cannot adopt a policy of compromise.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the two lines is a reflection of the class struggle within the Party. We must view this problem from the standpoint of dialectical materialism and not from the standpoint of metaphysics or that of a philistine.

Chairman Mao has said: "Different ideas and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection within the Party of the class contradictions and the contradictions between the new and the old in society. If there are no contradictions and no struggle to resolve them within the Party, the life of the Party will stop."

Chairman Mao has also said: "In the case of non-antagonistic contradictions between correct and incorrect ideas within the Communist Party, if the person who has committed an error insists on his error and expands it, this contradiction may develop into an antagonistic one."

The Central Committee of the Party believes that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comrades who have made mistakes in direction and line should face up to their errors, correct their errors, and return to the correct stand and line, instead of developing to the point of opposing the Party.

Those who persist in the erroneous line are only a handful of people. They are detached from the people, oppose the people, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they are bound to fail. The masses who have been temporarily deceived and misled by them will surely awaken, draw a clear line of demarcation with them, and oppose them.

Comrade Lin Biao, a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and called for the launch of a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This movement, which started from the People's Liberation Army and spread to the people of the entire country, has achieved great results. This movement has made Mao Zedong Thought penetrate deeper into the hearts of the people. With the billion-strong masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great leap forward in the spiritual outlook of the people will inevitably be transformed into tremendous material force.

Over the past seventeen years, Comrade Mao Zedong has always firmly grasped the basic contradictions in socialist society and proposed and solved problems. Today, as our socialist society has developed to this stage, Comrade Mao Zedong has put forward the theory and line of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great development of Marxism-Leninism and a great innovation in the history of the communist movement.

The historical experience of the international proletariat, especially the historical lesson of the emergence of the revisionist rule in the Soviet Union, tells us that only by carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly criticizing all the ideological systems of the exploiting classes, criticizing the bourgeois academic "authorities," reforming education, reforming literature and art, reforming all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, and uprooting the bourgeois agents hidden within the Party, can we smash bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent the emergence of revisionist rule, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and ensure that our cause advances victoriously along the socialist and communist road.

The revisionist leadership of the CPSU and other traitors and renegades daily curse our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a frenzy. Why do they curse it so? Because they realize that the influence of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is unstoppable. It will surely awaken the revolutionary proletarians and the broad masses of revolutionary people in their own countries to rise up against them. Their ruling seats are shaky.

The laws of history are unchangeable. All reactionaries at home and abroad will inevitably be punished by history. They will all be buried by the revolutionary masses who are their own gravediggers.

No matter how the enemy curses and attacks, the great Chinese people will advance along their own path, the path of victory, the path of Mao Zedong Thought, with heads held high, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, pushing the various undertakings of socialist revolution and socialist construction from victory to victory.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao is reviewing the revolutionary masses from Tiananmen Gate.

Comrade Lin Biao is delivering a speech at the celebration of the seventeenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in the capital.

Mao, you are the red sun in the hearts of all our ethnic minorities. We bring the boundless faith and love of tens of millions of ethnic minorities for you. May you live forever!

    在毛泽东思想的大路上前进
    《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十三期社论
    今年，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在我国社会主义革命发展到一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段中，庆祝伟大的国庆节。这是一个最不平凡的节日，这是一个革命精神空前高昂的节日，这是一个最令人欢欣鼓舞的节日。
    中华人民共和国成立的十七年，是全国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗凯歌猛进的十七年。十七年来，在政治、经济、军事、文化各个领域里，都取得了非常辉煌的成就。我们的成就，受到了全世界革命人民的热烈赞扬，使得帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派胆颤心惊。社会主义的新中国屹立在东方，使整个世界的革命斗争形势发生了巨大的变化。
    我们十七年的伟大成就是怎样取得的呢？把我们的基本经验归结到一点，就是毛主席所说的，紧紧抓住无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争这个纲。我们的胜利，是无产阶级对资产阶级斗争的胜利，是社会主义道路对资本主义道路斗争的胜利。
    毛主席在一九四九年三月中国共产党七届二中全会的报告中就指出，中国革命在全国胜利，并且解决了土地问题以后，国内的基本矛盾就是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。这就是说，工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，贯串在整个社会主义历史过程的始终，贯串在社会主义社会的各个方面。
    十七年的历史经验证明，凡是抓住了两个阶级、两条道路斗争这个纲，我们无产阶级的革命事业就发展，就前进，就生动活泼，就欣欣向荣。凡是离开了这个纲的地方和部门，就出现歪风邪气，就迷失方向，就受到挫折。
    毛泽东同志在一九六五年一月中共中央政治局召集的全国工作会议上告诉我们：
    整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路斗争的新阶段。
    这次文化大革命，涉及的范围很广。我们要横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，要在意识形态领域里大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，并且势必触及到社会的政治生活和经济生活。这次文化大革命要打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，打击那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派。
    广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子同一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是现阶段无产阶级同资产阶级斗争、社会主义同资本主义斗争的集中表现。
    为什么党内会出现一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派呢？这是由阶级斗争规律决定的。在无产阶级专政的条件下，被推翻了的剥削阶级总是企图用各种办法腐蚀共产党的干部，在我们党内寻找他们的代理人。毛主席在党的七届二中全会上就教导我们，必须警惕资产阶级“用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击”。这是向全体共产党员敲起的警钟。绝大多数共产党员经受住了这种考验。但是，也有一小撮人却被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中了。他们已经不是无产阶级的代表，而是资产阶级的代表。
    党内走资本主义道路的当权派，是一小撮反革命的修正主义分子。他们打着“红旗”反红旗。他们是赫鲁晓夫式的人物。一旦有机可乘，他们就要阴谋篡党，篡军，篡政。他们是我们最危险的最主要的敌人。被推翻了的剥削阶级，把复辟的希望主要地寄托在他们身上。剥削阶级的复辟活动，主要是通过他们进行的，或者是在他们包庇下进行的。所以，只有打倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，才能粉碎剥削阶级的复辟阴谋，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，推动社会主义事业的发展。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即十六条，是两条路线斗争的产物，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线战胜资产阶级反动路线的产物。十六条的公布，获得了广大革命群众的热烈拥护，把无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新的高潮。整个的革命形势好得很，越来越好。
    但是，两条路线的斗争并未就此结束。有些地方，有些单位，两条路线的斗争还是很尖锐，很复杂的。有极少数人采取新的形式欺骗群众，对抗十六条，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，极力采取挑动群众斗群众的形式，去达到他们的目的。
    对资产阶级反动路线，必须彻底批判。只有彻底批判它，肃清它的影响，才能贯彻执行无产阶级的十六条，才能在正确路线指导下进行社会上的、学校的以及其他文化部门的斗、批、改，才能明确斗什么，批什么，改什么，才能明确依靠谁来斗，谁来批，谁来改，才能胜利完成一斗二批三改的任务。如果继续过去的错误路线，重复压制群众的错误，继续挑动学生斗争学生，不解放过去受打击的革命群众，等等，那就是对抗和破坏十六条。在这种情况下，怎么能够正确地进行斗批改呢？
    要不要批判资产阶级反动路线，是能不能贯彻执行文化革命的十六条，能不能正确进行广泛的斗批改的关键。在这里，不能采取折衷主义。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，两条路线的斗争，是阶级斗争在党内的反映。我们必须用唯物辩证法的观点，而不能用形而上学的观点、庸人的观点来看待这个问题。
    毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”
    毛主席还说：在共产党内发生正确思想和错误思想的非对抗性矛盾的情况下，“如果犯错误的人坚持错误，并扩大下去，这种矛盾也就存在着发展为对抗性的东西的可能性”。
    党中央认为，在无产阶级文化大革命中，犯过方向错误、路线错误的同志，应当正视自己的错误，改正自己的错误，回到正确立场、正确路线上来，而不要发展到同党对抗的地步。
    坚持错误路线的人，只是一小撮人。他们脱离人民，反对人民，反对毛泽东思想。因此，他们是一定要失败的。一时被他们蒙蔽和欺骗的群众，一定会觉悟起来，同他们划清界限，反对他们。　　　　
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，号召开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。这个运动，从人民解放军发展到全国人民群众，取得了伟大的效果。这个运动，使毛泽东思想更加深入人心。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万群众，这是无产阶级文化大革命胜利的最可靠的保证。人民群众精神面貌的飞跃，必然转化为巨大的物质力量。
    十七年来，毛泽东同志总是紧紧把握着社会主义社会的基本矛盾的发展，提出问题、解决问题的。我国社会主义社会发展到今天，毛泽东同志提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论和路线，这是马克思列宁主义的伟大发展，这是共产主义运动历史上的伟大创举。
    国际无产阶级的历史经验，特别是苏联出现修正主义统治的历史教训告诉我们，只有进行无产阶级文化大革命，彻底批判一切剥削阶级的意识形态，批判资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，改革教育，改革文艺，改革一切不适合社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，挖掉隐藏在党内的资产阶级代理人，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，才能巩固无产阶级专政，防止出现修正主义统治，防止资本主义复辟，使我们的事业沿着社会主义和共产主义的方向胜利前进。
    苏共修正主义领导集团和其他的叛徒、工贼，天天疯狂地咒骂我们的无产阶级文化大革命。他们为什么要这样咒骂呢？这是因为他们意识到中国这场无产阶级文化大革命的影响是无法阻挡的。它必然会唤醒他们国内的无产阶级革命派，唤醒广大的革命人民起来反对他们。他们统治的宝座是岌岌可危的。
    历史的规律是不可改变的。国内外的一切反动派，绝不能逃脱历史的惩罚。他们都将被自己的掘墓人革命群众所埋葬。
    不管敌人怎样叫骂和攻击，伟大的中国人民，都将沿着自己的道路，胜利的道路，毛泽东思想的道路，昂首阔步地前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各项事业，从胜利推向胜利。（附图片）
