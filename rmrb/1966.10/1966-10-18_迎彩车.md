	Welcoming the Decorated Car
	By a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Yu Guanglie

	Holding high the Chairman Mao's Quotations,
	Red flags fluttering in the wind,
	Applause like thunder and drums,
	Welcoming the decorated car.

	Welcoming the decorated car,
	The military camp becomes a sea of joy;
	The decorated car is loaded with revolutionary treasures,
	The four volumes of the golden book shine brightly.

	Pair after pair of smiling eyes with tears of joy,
	Face after face of smiles blooming like flowers,
	Holding Chairman Mao's works in hand,
	A red sun shines in our hearts.

	A red sun shines in our hearts,
	Red hearts fly towards Zhongnanhai;
	Ten thousand songs and melodies cannot express it,
	The singing voice drifts to the clouds in the sky:

	Great leader Chairman Mao!
	We are infinitely loyal and admire you endlessly;
	We listen to every word you say,
	We will pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.

	Great leader Chairman Mao!
	We have infinite faith and love for you;
	We read your books word by word,
	We will forever be thorough revolutionaries.

	Great leader Chairman Mao!
	You are our most brilliant helmsman and commander.
	Soldiers will read your books for life,
	We will let Mao Zedong Thought shine red all over the world.

	Every red heart is beating,
	Excited tears fill our cheeks.
	Mao Zedong Thought nurtures us,
	Soldiers grow into pillars of the nation.

    迎彩车
    解放军某部　余光烈
    高举毛主席语录牌，
    面面红旗迎风摆，
    掌声如雷锣鼓响，
    喜迎彩车来。
    喜迎彩车来，
    军营变成欢乐的海；
    彩车满载革命的宝呀，
    金书四卷放光彩。
    双双笑眼泪光闪，
    张张笑脸鲜花开，
    毛主席著作手中捧，
    一轮红日照心怀。
    一轮红日照心怀，
    红心飞向中南海；
    千歌万曲唱不尽呀，
    歌声飘到云天外：
    伟大的领袖毛主席呵！
    我们对您无限忠诚无限崇拜；
    您的话咱句句都听，
    毛泽东思想要一代传一代。
    伟大的领袖毛主席呵！
    我们对您无限信仰无限热爱；
    您的书我们字字细读，
    永做完全彻底革命派。
    伟大的领袖毛主席呵！
    您是我们最英明的舵手和统帅。
    战士要一辈子读您的书，
    定让毛泽东思想照红全世界
    ……
    颗颗红心都在跳啊，
    激动的热泪挂满腮。
    毛泽东思想哺育咱，
    战士长成栋梁材。
