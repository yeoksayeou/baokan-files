One morning, the weather was particularly hot. I was lying on the ground practicing aiming, and sweat was pouring down. I couldn't take it anymore, so I ran to the shade of a tree to cool off.

Our classmate Wang Yùxǐ saw this and said to me, "Little Wēi, hurry up and practice. Only by practicing in the heat can you build real skills!"

I was very angry when I heard this and thought, "What business is it of yours? If you can hit the target, I can too!"

Just as I was about to retort to Wang Yùxǐ, I suddenly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Since we are serving the people, we should not fear criticism. No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should correct them. As long as you are right, we will correct our mistakes. If your methods benefit the people, we will follow them."

Wang Yùxǐ criticized me because he is responsible to the people. By telling me to practice more, he helps me build strong combat skills. On the battlefield, I can then defeat more enemies, which is beneficial to the people. Thinking of this, I happily returned to the practice field and sincerely admitted my fear of hardship to Wang Yùxǐ. Seeing that I humbly accepted his advice, Wang Yùxǐ became even more enthusiastic in helping me.

Chairman Mao's words are true! I will definitely always read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

    为人民服务就不怕别人批评
    战士　庹维庆
    一天上午，天气特别热，趴在地上练瞄准，汗水不停地流。我受不了，就跑到树荫下乘凉去了。
    我们班的王玉喜同志看见了，就对我说：“小庹，赶快来练吧，天热才能练出硬功夫啊！”
    我听了很生气，心里想：“你管我干啥？你能打上我也照样能打上！”
    我正要把王玉喜顶回去，忽然想起毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”王玉喜批评我，是对人民负责；叫我多练一会，练一身过硬的杀敌本领，到战场上就能消灭更多的敌人，这不是对人民有好处吗？想到这里，我就愉快地回到练兵场，并且向王玉喜检查了自己的怕苦思想。王玉喜见我虚心诚恳，接受意见，就更加热情地帮助我。
    毛主席的话就是灵！我一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
