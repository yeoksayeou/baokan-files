At a time when the international situation is chaotic and a wave of "stop bombing and negotiate" is sweeping through, the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership are tightening their collusion and engaging in a dirty deal over the Vietnam issue. The curtain has been lifted, and the truth is emerging.

On October 10, Gromyko held a secret meeting at the White House with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, further exposing the traitorous face of the Soviet leadership in betraying Vietnam.

According to Western media reports, Gromyko suggested in the White House that if the U.S. "stops bombing North Vietnam," the problem can be "resolved." Johnson, after hearing this, said excitedly, "I feel more inspired than ever before." At the same time, Gromyko, in his secret talks with British Foreign Secretary Brown, repeatedly emphasized the need to "stop the bombing." In Brown's words, "If the U.S. stops bombing North Vietnam, the Soviet leaders are willing to play an active role in the peace process in Vietnam"; the West "has reached a clear understanding with the Russians on what needs to be done."

The U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding, aiming to "stop bombing and negotiate," sacrificing Vietnam, and attempting to create a new Munich in the East to oppose the Vietnamese people, encircle China, and suppress the national liberation movements in Asia. We must thoroughly expose this and resolutely oppose it.

The conspiracy of "stop bombing and negotiate" by the U.S. and the Soviet Union has been going on for a long time. At the end of last year, the U.S.'s "temporary halt to bombing" was an idea from the Soviet leadership. Johnson, in his secret talks with Gromyko at the White House, referred to that "halt to bombing" as the "Dobrynin halt to bombing." At that time, due to the relentless exposure and persistent struggle of the Vietnamese people, that "temporary halt to bombing" was completely foiled. Now, they are trying the "Gromyko halt to bombing." It seems that the Soviet leadership will not give up until they drag Vietnam into the U.S.'s "peace talks" trap and bring the Vietnam issue onto the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation.

"Stop bombing and negotiate" means surrendering Vietnam. To resolve the Vietnam issue, we must follow the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The key issue is: the withdrawal of all armed forces of the U.S. and its puppets from Vietnam, the recognition of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole legitimate representative of the South Vietnamese people, and the recognition of the right of the Vietnamese people to solve their own problems. The U.S. does not withdraw its troops, and there is no possibility of any peace talks. Now, the U.S. does not mention the immediate withdrawal of its invading troops but wants to use the blackmail tactic of "stopping the bombing" of the North to achieve its evil goal of continuing to occupy South Vietnam and to obtain what it cannot get on the battlefield. In other words, it wants the Vietnamese people to give up their sacred struggle against the U.S. and sign a "capitulation agreement" with the U.S. invaders.

The Soviet leadership is currently working hard to help U.S. imperialism realize the grand conspiracy of "stop bombing and negotiate." Whether it is Gromyko's talks in the U.S. or Brezhnev's speech in Moscow, whether in the United Nations or in public and private settings, the Soviet leadership does not mention the immediate withdrawal of U.S. invading troops from Vietnam but repeatedly talks about "stopping the bombing." This is the shameful act of the Soviet leadership colluding with U.S. imperialism to try to strangle the Vietnamese revolution.

The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. not only concerns the interests of the Vietnamese people but also the interests of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia and the world. The brave Vietnamese people have fought against hundreds of thousands of U.S. invading troops, making the U.S. imperialist's massive military forces bogged down in the Vietnam battlefield. This has fundamentally disrupted the U.S. imperialist's global strategic deployment. The greater the victory of the Vietnamese people's armed struggle against U.S. imperialism, the more weakened the U.S. will be in the world, and the anti-U.S. struggles in Asia and the world will develop further. It is for this reason that U.S. imperialism is making a desperate struggle to try to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people.

The Soviet leadership claims to be "assisting" the struggle of the Vietnamese people. However, what they are actually doing is engaging in a global deal with U.S. imperialism. The Vietnamese people are fighting a bloody war of resistance, while the Soviet leadership is embracing the U.S. invaders who are slaughtering the Vietnamese people, making deals on issues such as disarmament, preventing nuclear proliferation, and European issues, helping U.S. imperialism realize its counter-revolutionary plan of shifting its strategic focus to the East. At the same time, they are frantically and blatantly collaborating with U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy on the Vietnam issue, launching a pincer attack on the Vietnamese people. Johnson personally went to Asia to rally his lackeys, convening the Manila meeting, plotting to expand the war on one hand, and playing the "stop bombing and negotiate" trick on the other. The Soviet leadership and its followers, on the other hand, are engaged in intense activities in Moscow, vigorously advocating for the U.S. to "stop bombing" and seeking a "peaceful" resolution to the Vietnam issue. The activities of the U.S. and the Soviet Union are planned and fully coordinated. Where is this "assistance" to the Vietnamese people in their anti-U.S. struggle? This is clearly a great betrayal and sellout of the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people!

All evidence shows that the counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet leadership has actually formed. They are joining forces not only against the Vietnamese people but also against the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially targeting China. For the time being, their goal is to make the "peace talks" conspiracy succeed and bury the great cause of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S.

The Soviet leadership is engaging in "joint actions" with U.S. imperialism on a global scale. Yet, it still sings about the "joint actions" of socialist countries to "assist Vietnam." This is sheer nonsense! What "joint actions" mean is joint sellout. Without "joint actions," the Soviet leadership has already openly and shamelessly betrayed Vietnam. If "joint actions" are carried out, wouldn't it help them to do the sellout more boldly and freely? Now, the Soviet leadership is shouting about "joint actions" precisely to adapt to its need to make a big deal with U.S. imperialism.

The grand conspiracy of the new Munich in the East staged by the U.S. and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly clear to the people of the world. The Vietnamese people's firm stance in their war of resistance against the U.S. is unshakable. All truly anti-imperialist countries should support the Vietnamese people in carrying their war of resistance against the U.S. to the end and resolutely oppose the grand conspiracy of the new Munich in the East, not allowing this conspiracy to succeed!

The Chinese people's stance in supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. is unwavering. Comrade Lin Biao's speech on October 1 of this year concentrates the strong will and great resolve of 700 million Chinese people. Comrade Lin Biao said: "We have made all the necessary preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support our Vietnamese comrades in carrying their war of resistance against the U.S. to the end. The imperialists led by the U.S. and the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party are colluding and actively engaging in the deception of peace talks, aiming to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's national revolutionary war against the U.S., extinguish the flames of the national revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and extinguish the flames of the world revolution. As long as the people of the world keep their eyes open, their conspiracies will not succeed."

Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Chairman Mao also said: "It can be proved that the people's revolution can win victory and that imperialism and its running dogs can be defeated." The history of Vietnam can only be created by the Vietnamese people. The future of Vietnam can only be decided by the Vietnamese people. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet leadership want to reverse the wheel of history and decide the fate of the Vietnamese people, which is absolutely impossible! The revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people will burn brighter and brighter until they turn the U.S. invaders into ashes!

    揭穿美苏串演的新的东方慕尼黑
    观察家
    正当国际上群魔乱舞，掀起一股“停炸迫和”的妖风的时候，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团加紧勾结，在越南问题上进行一场肮脏的大交易。黑幕已经拉开，真相正在大白。
    葛罗米柯十月十日在白宫的小黑会上，同美帝国主义头子约翰逊的密谈，进一步暴露了苏联领导集团出卖越南的叛徒面目。
    据西方报刊透露，葛罗米柯在白宫献策，只要美国“停炸北越”，问题就可以“求得解决”。约翰逊听了以后，兴高采烈地说：“我感到前所未有的鼓舞。”同时，葛罗米柯在和英国外交大臣布朗的密谈中，也一再强调“必须停止轰炸”。用布朗的话来说：“如果美国停止轰炸北越，俄国领导人就愿意在越南和平中起积极作用”；西方“在需要做些什么的问题上同俄国人达成了明确的谅解”。
    美苏勾结，“停炸迫和”，牺牲越南，妄图造成反对越南人民、包围中国和镇压亚洲民族解放运动的新的东方慕尼黑的局面。我们必须彻底揭穿它，坚决反对它。
    美苏合谋“停炸迫和”的骗局，由来已久。去年年底，美国搞的“暂停轰炸”的把戏，就是苏联领导集团出的主意。约翰逊在白宫同葛罗米柯的密谈中，就把那一次的“停炸”称之为“多勃雷宁的停炸”。当时，由于越南人民的无情揭露和坚持战斗，才使那一次“暂停轰炸”的骗局彻底破产。现在，它们又在搞“葛罗米柯的停炸”。看来，苏联领导集团不把越南拖进美国“和谈”的圈套，不把越南问题纳入美苏合作的轨道，是决不会死心的。
    “停炸迫和”，说穿了，就是要越南人民投降。要解决越南问题，必须按照越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明办事。关键的问题是：美国及其仆从的一切武装力量从越南撤走，承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民唯一合法的代表，承认越南人民有权自己解决自己的问题。美国不撤军，就没有任何和平谈判的可能。现在，美国只字不谈立即撤出它的侵略军，而是想用“停炸”北方的讹诈手段，来达到它继续霸占南越的罪恶目的，得到它在战场上所得不到的东西。换句话说，就是要越南人民放弃抗美救国的神圣斗争，同美国侵略强盗订立“城下之盟”。
    苏联领导集团目前正在大卖力气地帮助美帝国主义，实现“停炸迫和”的大阴谋。无论是葛罗米柯在美国的谈话，还是勃列日涅夫在莫斯科的演说，无论在联合国内外，还是在公开和私下的场合，苏联领导集团也只字不谈美国侵略军立即从越南撤出，而是喋喋不休地大谈“停止轰炸”。这是苏联领导集团同美帝国主义合谋，企图扼杀越南革命的无耻勾当。
    越南人民的抗美救国战争，不仅关系到越南人民的利益，也关系到亚洲和全世界人民反帝革命斗争的利益。英勇的越南人民，抗击了几十万美国侵略军，使美帝国主义庞大的军事力量陷于越南战场，这就从根本上打乱了美帝国主义全球战略的部署。越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的武装斗争胜利越大，美国在世界上的地位就更加削弱，亚洲和全世界的反美斗争将会得到更大的发展。正是因为这样，美帝国主义要作拚死的挣扎，力图把越南人民的这场革命烈火扑灭下去。
    苏联领导集团口口声声吹嘘它们“援助”越南人民的斗争。但是，它们实际上干的却是同美帝国主义进行全球性的大交易。越南人民在浴血抗战，而苏联领导集团却同屠杀越南人民的美国侵略者拍肩拥抱，就裁军问题、防止核扩散问题、欧洲问题等大做买卖，帮助美帝国主义实现它战略重点东移的反革命计划。同时，它们还疯狂地、露骨地配合美帝国主义在越南问题上的反革命两手政策，对越南人民实行夹攻。约翰逊亲自出马，到亚洲去纠集它的娄罗，召开马尼拉会议，一手策划扩大战争的阴谋，一手玩弄“停炸迫和”的把戏。而苏联领导集团及其追随者，则在莫斯科进行紧张活动，大肆鼓吹美国“停炸”，寻求越南问题的“和平”解决。美苏两家的活动，是有计划的，是完全商量好了的。这那里是什么“援助”越南人民进行反美斗争！这不明明是对越南人民革命斗争的大出卖、大背叛吗？
    种种事实证明，美帝国主义和苏联领导集团的反革命的新“神圣同盟”，事实上已经形成。它们联合起来，不仅是反对越南人民，而且是反对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民的革命斗争，特别是把矛头指向中国。从当前来说，它们的目的是要使“和谈”阴谋得逞，葬送越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大事业。
    苏联领导集团在世界范围内，全面地同美帝国主义“联合行动”。可是它还高唱什么社会主义国家“援越联合行动”。简直是活见鬼！所谓“联合行动”，就是联合出卖。没有“联合行动”，苏联领导集团就已经这样公开无耻地出卖越南，如果搞成“联合行动”，那岂不是帮助它更放手大胆地干叛卖勾当吗？现在，苏联领导集团大嚷“联合行动”，正是为了适应它同美帝国主义进行大交易的需要。
    美苏串演的新的东方慕尼黑的大阴谋，已经越来越清楚地暴露在全世界人民的面前了。越南人民坚持抗美救国斗争的严正立场，是不可动摇的。一切真正反对帝国主义的国家，都应该支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底，坚决反对新的东方慕尼黑的大阴谋，不让这个大阴谋得逞！
    中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的立场，是坚定不移的。林彪同志今年十月一日的讲话，集中地表达了七亿中国人民的坚强意志和伟大决心。林彪同志说：“我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，正在狼狈为奸，积极搞和谈欺骗的勾当，目的是要扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火，扑灭亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族革命斗争的烈火，扑灭世界革命的烈火。只要全世界人民擦亮眼睛，他们的阴谋是不能得逞的。”
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”毛主席又说：“可以证明，人民的革命是能够胜利的，帝国主义及其走狗是能够打败的。”越南的历史，只能由越南人民来创造。越南的前途，只能由越南人民来决定。美帝国主义和苏联领导集团想要倒转历史车轮，决定越南人民的命运，这是万万办不到的！越南人民的革命烈火，必将越烧越旺，直到把美国侵略者烧成灰烬！
