On October 18th, we, a group of young people from the Jinggangshan area—all the students and teachers from Lianhua County Middle School in Jiangxi who came to Beijing as revolutionary representatives—saw our great leader Chairman Mao. Our hearts were as vast and surging as the Yangtze River, filled with waves of joy.

How could we not be excited on this extraordinary day! Countless dawns, we looked at the rising sun in the east and thought of Beijing, thought of Chairman Mao. Countless nights, we gazed at the bright North Star and also thought of Beijing, thought of Chairman Mao. Year after year, day after day, we longed for Beijing, dreaming that wings would grow on our backs so we could fly to Beijing to see our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the people's beloved leader, the savior of humanity, the embodiment of truth! We saw you, and a thousand words boiled down to one sentence: Forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!

Lianhua County is an old revolutionary base area. As early as February 1928, Chairman Mao established the party organization here and led the people in revolution. In his article "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," Chairman Mao detailed the revolutionary experiences of Lianhua and other places at that time. He said that after the March 18th Incident, the local armed forces in Lianhua only had one gun left. But the spark of revolution was not extinguished. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, the old revolutionaries of Lianhua were full of fighting spirit, stood up together to make revolution, with a red heart for the people, and finally won the red land of today.

The people of Lianhua County have the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao because we have the deepest understanding of Chairman Mao's greatness and correctness. When the revolution on Jinggangshan was just a spark, Chairman Mao saw the bright future and led us to turn the spark into a prairie fire. When Lianhua County only had one gun, Chairman Mao still led us with full confidence to launch a struggle against the enemy, turning one gun into a powerful people's armed force.

The people of Lianhua County also have the deepest understanding of the arduousness of the revolution. Our predecessors saw with their own eyes that under Chairman Mao's leadership, the struggle on Jinggangshan had gone through such a hard road. We must inherit the cause of the revolutionary forerunners, hold high the torch of Jinggangshan, and advance along the road opened by Chairman Mao!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death class struggle. Dearest Chairman Mao, in this struggle, we promise to follow you in revolution to the end, just like we did on Jinggangshan back then. This time we came to Beijing, learned revolutionary experience, and took the revolutionary spark. On the 18th, we saw you, and we were greatly inspired. We will definitely bring the revolutionary spirit of the Beijing people back home and let Mao Zedong Thought bloom and bear fruit in Lianhua County.

    高高举起井冈山的火把
    十月十八日，我们这群井冈山区的青年人——江西莲花县中学全体来北京革命师生代表，见到了我们的伟大领袖毛主席，我们的心情就像长江大河，喜悦的浪花汹涌起伏。
    在这个不平凡的日子里，我们怎能不激动呢！多少个黎明，我们望着东方冉冉升起的太阳，就想起了北京，想起了毛主席。多少个夜晚，望到亮晶晶的北斗星，也想到了北京，想到了毛主席。我们年年月月，朝朝暮暮思念着北京，幻想身上能长上翅膀飞向北京，见见我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席。毛主席是劳动人民的亲人，人类的救星，真理的化身！我们见到了您，千言万语汇成一句话：永远跟着毛主席闹革命！
    莲花县是个老革命根据地。毛主席早在一九二八年二月，就在这里建立了党组织，领导群众闹革命。毛主席在《井冈山的斗争》一文中，曾经详细地总结了当年莲花等地的斗争经验。他说，在马日事变后，莲花的地方武装只保存了一枝枪。但是星星之火并没有被扑灭，我们莲花县的老革命前辈在毛主席的领导下，斗志昂扬，一起起来闹革命，一颗红心为人民，终于打出了今天的红色江山。
    我们莲花县人民对毛主席的感情最深厚，因为我们对毛主席的伟大和正确有最深切的体会，当井冈山上的革命还只是星星之火的时候，毛主席就看到了光明的未来，并且带领我们把星星之火燃成了燎原大火。当我们莲花县只有一杆枪的时候，毛主席依然满怀信心地领导我们展开对敌斗争，把一杆枪发展成了强大的人民武装。
    我们莲花县人民对革命的艰巨性也最有体会，我们的前辈亲眼看见，在毛主席领导下，井冈山的斗争曾经经历了多么艰苦的道路。我们一定要继承革命前辈的事业，高举井冈山的火把，沿着毛主席开辟的道路前进！
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。最敬爱的毛主席，在这场斗争中，我们保证要像当年在井冈山上那样，紧紧地跟着您革命到底。我们这次来北京，学了革命的经验，取了革命的火种。十八日我们看见了您，更受到了最大的鼓舞，我们一定要把北京人民的革命精神带回去，让毛泽东思想更好地在莲花县开花结果。
