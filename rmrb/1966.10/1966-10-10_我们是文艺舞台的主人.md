We Are the Masters of the Cultural Stage

Beijing Military Region, a certain unit's soldiers, Wang Zijie, Chang Yuxi

After watching the performance by the amateur performing troupe of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we felt our blood boiling and our spirits surging.

Chairman Mao said: "The literature and art of the proletariat are an integral part of the proletariat's entire revolutionary cause, just as Lenin said, they are the 'gears and screws' of the entire revolutionary machine." The cultural stage is an important battlefield. If the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. In the past, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang sneered at our workers, peasants, and soldiers' art as "unfit for the grand stage," striking down our programs with a single blow and sending them to the cold palace. He filled our socialist stage with the dead, the ancients, and foreigners. Seeing this phenomenon, we soldiers were so angry that our lungs almost burst.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is like a clap of spring thunder. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up with mighty clubs, sweeping away the ghosts and snakes that have occupied the socialist cultural stage, and reclaiming our territory. They have liberated their minds, daring to break and dare to establish, with the attitude of masters, they have proudly and confidently stepped onto the cultural stage. With all their hearts, they sing loudly in praise of the great Communist Party of China, they sing loudly in praise of the great teacher, the great leader, the great helmsman, and the great navigator Chairman Mao. They say: "Thinking of Chairman Mao, there are a thousand poems in my heart; thinking of Chairman Mao, there are ten thousand songs on my lips." They say: "In a thousand ways, nothing is better than Chairman Mao; in a thousand songs, we can never sing enough of Chairman Mao's endless grace." They sing: "The sun is Chairman Mao. The sun is red, the sun is bright, you are the red sun in our hearts." Hearing these heartfelt songs, we feel especially close and excited. They sing what we want to sing, they say what we want to say, they perform what we want to see.

Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought, since they can smash an old world, they can build a new world. Look, the stage today is dominated by us, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers! The stage sings praises of the great Mao Zedong Thought, of the heroes of our time, of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Let the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and all the ghosts and snakes that once dominated our stage, all go to hell! The workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen in rebellion! We will let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever on the cultural battlefield!

    我们是文艺舞台的主人
    北京部队某部战士　王子杰　畅玉玺
    看了工农兵业余演出队演出的节目，我们感到周身热血沸腾，浑身是劲。
    毛主席说：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”文艺舞台是一个重要阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级势必要去占领。过去，反革命修正主义分子周扬讥笑我们工农兵的文艺“不能登大雅之堂”，把工农兵的节目一棍子打入冷宫，让死人、古人和洋人塞满了我们社会主义的舞台。看到这种现象，我们战士的肺都快气炸了。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命犹如一声春雷，广大的工农兵奋起千钧棒，横扫了窃踞着社会主义文艺舞台的牛鬼蛇神，夺回了自己的阵地。他们解放思想，敢破敢立，以主人翁的姿态，昂首挺胸登上了文艺舞台。他们以满腔的热情，放声歌颂伟大的中国共产党，放声歌颂伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席。他们说：“想起毛主席，心中有千句诗；想起毛主席，嘴边有万句歌。”他们说：“千好万好，比不上毛主席好；千唱万唱，唱不完毛主席的恩情长。”他们唱道：“太阳就是毛主席。太阳红，太阳亮，你是我们心中的红太阳。”听了这些发自内心的歌唱，我们感到特别的亲切、激动。他们唱的正是我们所要唱的，他们说的正是我们所要说的，他们演的正是我们所愿意看的。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，既然能够打烂一个旧世界，就能够建立一个新世界。请看，今日的舞台，占统治地位的已经是我们广大工农兵！舞台上歌颂的是伟大的毛泽东思想，是我们时代的英雄，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵。让曾经霸占过我们舞台的帝王将相，才子佳人和一切牛鬼蛇神统统见鬼去吧！工农兵起来造反了！我们要让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在文艺阵地上千秋万代高高飘扬！
