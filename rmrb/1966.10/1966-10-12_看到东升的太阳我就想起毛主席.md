Every morning, I read materials about China and gaze out at the Pacific Ocean. The sun rises from this direction every day, and when I see the rising sun, I think of Chairman Mao and the song "The East is Red."

The Vietnamese people often mention Mao Zedong Thought. When I was still a student, my teachers told me: "Mao Zedong Thought is great; the 650 million Chinese people are united under Mao Zedong, forming an invincible whole that shines with boundless brilliance." At that time, these words stirred boundless admiration in my young heart. Our history lessons taught us that before the era of Mao Zedong, there had never been a unified China. Now I understand what Mao Zedong Thought is. Have not Mao Zedong and "The East is Red" become synonymous? Indeed, they have.

    看到东升的太阳我就想起毛主席
    我每天早上读到关于中国的材料，我都眺望着太平洋。每天的太阳是从这边升起的，看到初升的太阳，我就想起毛主席，想起《东方红》。
    越南人民经常提起毛泽东思想。当我还在念书的时候，老师就说过：毛泽东思想很伟大，六亿五千万中国人民统一成以毛泽东为顶点的光芒万丈的无敌于天下的整体。当时，在我幼稚的心灵里引起无限钦佩。历史课告诉我们，在毛泽东时代以前，还没有过一个统一的中国。现在我已懂得毛泽东思想是什么。毛泽东和东方红不是已经成为异音同义词了吗？确实是这样。
