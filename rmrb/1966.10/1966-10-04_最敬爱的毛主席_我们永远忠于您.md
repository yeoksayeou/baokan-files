The great leader, together with 1.5 million revolutionary masses, celebrates the festival, inspiring 700 million people. We are eternally loyal to you, dearest Chairman Mao!

Revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers across the country enthusiastically acclaim: Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao are in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation and the people of the world. They unanimously declare that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and build our great motherland to be even stronger and more prosperous. Support the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

According to Xinhua News Agency on October 3, in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary masses in major cities across the country, celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, heard the news that Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen Rostrum, received representatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, workers, peasants, ethnic minorities, and Red Guards, and celebrated the National Day night with hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses. This news has made them feel even more excited and joyful. Revolutionary masses said that this news and Comrade Lin Biao's important speech are major events in our country's political life, adding to our joy in celebrating the National Day this year. They said, our dearest great leader Chairman Mao received our representatives on Tiananmen Rostrum again, as if he personally received us, which is the most intimate care and greatest encouragement for us. Revolutionary masses enthusiastically cheer for the health of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao. They declare that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, build our great motherland to be even stronger and more prosperous, and better support the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

Workers from Beijing Thermal Power Plant, who insisted on production during the festival, were excited when they learned that Chairman Mao spent more than six hours with revolutionary masses during the day and came to Tiananmen Square at night to celebrate the National Day night with revolutionary masses. Operator Mu Shaonan and maintenance worker Yuan Yongsheng said: Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most, never leaving the masses, and forever being heart-to-heart with revolutionary masses. We are working and fighting under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, which is our greatest happiness. We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and achieve new victories in revolution and production. Some Red Guards from Peking University said excitedly after participating in the parade, "We saw Chairman Mao in such good health, which is our greatest happiness. Our great teacher Chairman Mao leads us to swim in the stormy seas, and we will never lose our way."

Chairman Mao, full of energy and vigor, inspected the parade for more than six hours in the front; at night, he met with revolutionary masses warmly on Tiananmen Square. This great news has plunged millions of revolutionary masses and families in Shanghai into boundless happiness. People enthusiastically cheer: Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Long, long live! Workers from Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and famous "Daqing-style" enterprises such as Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and Yangshupu Power Plant, who insisted on production during the festival, were very excited. They proudly reviewed the great victories achieved in recent years under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply feeling that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth and victory. Workers from Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant solemnly celebrated the 8th anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the plant three days ago. Old workers who had the happiness of seeing Chairman Mao eight years ago said excitedly: Chairman Mao is as healthy as he was eight years ago, which is our greatest happiness. We will definitely be loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought forever, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Guangzhou, many workers, commune members, and revolutionary students studied and discussed Comrade Lin Biao's speech during the festival. Workers from Guangzhou Oxygen Plant, a national "Daqing-style" enterprise, reviewed the earth-shaking changes in their factory since liberation, especially in the past two years, and deeply realized that all achievements and victories were achieved under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. They declared that they would turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, better complete the production tasks for the fourth quarter, and fight a brilliant battle for the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. Some Red Guards from Zhongshan Medical College said at a symposium: Comrade Lin Biao's speech has made us further realize the importance of the Cultural Revolution. We will definitely insist on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and will never relax our revolutionary struggle. We are full of confidence that those who insist on the wrong line are only a small handful of people and are doomed to fail!

In Shenyang, in factories, offices, schools, shops, and tens of thousands of families, people discussed the touching scenes of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao with 1.5 million revolutionary masses with great joy and excitement. Shenyang City's model worker, engineer Zhou Zhenhua from Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, who took on the role of chief designer for the first time during the Cultural Revolution, successfully led the design of a Chinese-style lathe. He said: "One can go without eating or sleeping for a day, but one cannot go without studying Chairman Mao's works for a day. As long as one reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and no peak that cannot be climbed." He declared that he would definitely, like the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in one's mind, dissolve them in one's blood, and implement them in one's actions," design and manufacture more and better Chinese-style lathes, and make the greatest contribution to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Yang Jianfa, deputy director of the Shenyang Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association, a special-grade agricultural labor model in Liaoning, and director of Shenyang Suburban Five-Three People's Commune, was very excited after reading the October 2 issue of the Shenyang Evening News. He said: "Chairman Mao is the most intimate person to us poor and lower-middle peasants. He is forever heart-to-heart with us. I wish him eternal health. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest, brightest, and reddest lighthouse in the revolutionary journey. Every achievement we have made in our work is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow Chairman Mao closely and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will also do a good job in agricultural production and strive for double victories in revolution and production."

The news of our great leader Chairman Mao celebrating the National Day with 1.5 million people in the capital and various places across the country has greatly inspired the revolutionary masses in Chengdu. National People's Congress representative and famous industrial labor model Tian Jingqi was moved to tears when he heard that Chairman Mao sat with the masses during the National Day night. He said: "Parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao. The great achievements made in our country in the past 17 years are all achieved under Chairman Mao's leadership. Now, Chairman Mao is personally leading us to carry out the Cultural Revolution. We workers will stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and resolutely follow Chairman Mao to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be made to suffer a crushing defeat and will never be able to rise again!"

Revolutionary masses in Xi'an enthusiastically acclaim the great news that our dearest great leader Chairman Mao met with revolutionary masses warmly again during the National Day. National People's Congress representative, five-good model worker, and political instructor Chen Junde from the Third Workshop of Xi'an Petroleum Instrument Factory said: "When I heard the news that Chairman Mao participated in the National Day celebration, inspected the parade, and celebrated the National Day night with revolutionary masses, my heart was filled with excitement. During the Cultural Revolution, our great leader has repeatedly received revolutionary masses, inspiring our fighting spirit and adding boundless strength to us. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, seize revolution and promote production, arm our workers with Mao Zedong Thought, transform our souls, and turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will manufacture more and better petroleum instruments to support the petroleum front in extracting more petroleum."

According to Xinhua News Agency on October 3, workers, peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary students from various places who came to the capital to participate in the National Day celebration saw Chairman Mao and were greatly inspired, remaining in a state of great joy and happiness. They made a common vow with revolutionary passion: We will forever follow Chairman Mao, generation after generation will revolutionize, and generation after generation will not change our hearts.

The representatives excitedly said that on National Day, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao were with us from morning to afternoon for more than six hours. This is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, and greatest support for us. Chairman Mao received not only us few thousand people and the 1.5 million people who participated in this year's National Day gathering and parade but also the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country. Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao are full of energy and in good health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world.

Representatives of the 32111 proletarian revolutionary heroism drilling team saw Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Rostrum and were moved to tears. Many people wrote letters to their comrades and families at night to tell them the good news that Chairman Mao received them. Many people excitedly recorded their feelings on this most happiest day. Yang Xian'an, who suffered from landlord exploitation and oppression before liberation, wrote in his diary, "Thousands of words cannot express my love for Chairman Mao, and thousands of songs cannot sing out the passion in our hearts. I can only sincerely wish Chairman Mao eternal life."

National advanced producers, deputy chief engineer Wang Feng'en from Shenyang Transformer Factory, and worker Xiao Yinzhen from Shanghai Quxin Shipbuilding Factory all pointed out in their conversations that the great victories achieved in socialist revolution and socialist construction in the 17 years since liberation are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought and are the results of Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership.

Peasant representative and chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of Daqiao Brigade, Jia Jincai, saw Chairman Mao for the first time on Tiananmen Rostrum during this National Day. He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest. In the 17 years since liberation, it is he who has led all the people of China to achieve one victory after another. This year, Daqiao suffered a serious natural disaster but still achieved a bumper harvest. This is completely because Mao Zedong Thought has educated and inspired us, enabling us to overcome the disaster."

Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country wept with excitement when they saw our great leader Mao for the first time on Tiananmen Square. They said, "We gathered from all over the country to celebrate the National Day with the brightest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. This is our greatest happiness." They declared that they would forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. "Even if our heads are cut off and our blood is shed, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and advance in the stormy seas."

This time, ethnic minority Red Guards and revolutionary student representatives from remote areas also came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration. Revolutionary student representatives from the Tibet Nationalities Institute wrote a collective letter to Chairman Mao after seeing him, expressing their determination to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao in the stormy seas. Several ethnic minority students from the Qinghai Plateau were moved to tears when they mentioned the scene of seeing Chairman Mao during the National Day. They said, "We are all children of poor herdsmen. Our ancestors suffered oppression. Chairman Mao led us to liberation. We love Chairman Mao the most. This time, we will go back and study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently to be good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao."

According to Xinhua News Agency on October 3, "Dearest Chairman Mao, the people's soldiers are forever loyal to you!" This is the common voice from the bottom of the hearts of PLA representatives who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebration after attending the capital's celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of New China and seeing the great leader Chairman Mao.

Representatives from various units, carrying the boundless love of the broad masses of the PLA for Chairman Mao, called October 1st the happiest day and the most unforgettable day. They excitedly said that the great leader Chairman Mao celebrates the festival with the masses, which is the greatest encouragement, greatest care, and greatest support for the revolutionary masses. This once again most powerfully shows that Chairman Mao is forever with the masses and heart-to-heart with the masses. Many people wrote poems or thoughts full of revolutionary passion on the spot, expressing the determination of the people's soldiers to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Many people immediately called their units, sent telegrams, and reported the greatest news to their comrades: "Chairman Mao received us on Tiananmen Rostrum and took a group photo with us. Chairman Mao is radiant and vigorous, in good health." "For more than six hours, Chairman Mao was with us!"

Representative Su Longxing from the Beijing Military Region was so excited that he wrote with tears in his eyes: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, sailing the sea relies on the helmsman, you are the most talented helmsman of the revolutionary ship, guiding the direction of sailing. All things grow with the sun, you are the red sun that never sets in our hearts. You are radiant and vigorous, in such good health! This is our greatest happiness and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world."

It was already late at night, but the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun's former company representative Hou Caiyun was still writing: "Dear Chairman Mao, every time I open your precious book, a red sun rises in my heart. Chairman Mao's sunlight illuminates the soldiers' hearts, and the dew of Mao Zedong Thought nourishes our growth. I promise you: I will definitely, like Comrade Liu Yingjun, study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, actively implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought! Under your personal command, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

In recent days, representatives have enthusiastically discussed the earth-shaking great victories achieved in socialist revolution and socialist construction, on the ideological front and the material front, in the 17 years since the founding of New China. Everyone unanimously agreed that all victories, ten thousand victories, are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Every victory on each front is the result of Chairman Mao's brilliant and correct leadership. Many representatives used their personal experiences to illustrate that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of victory. Xu Yongjiang, who was awarded for his merits in the "August 6th" naval battle last year, said that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. Our troops are fearless of hardship and death, dare to fight close-range and night battles, and fight with bayonets, sinking enemy ships many times larger than ours to the bottom of the sea. This is because our soldiers have mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Representative of the Wuhan Military Region, political instructor of a certain unit, Gong Huacheng, used the facts of his unit's revolutionary construction to illustrate: Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental of our army building. He said, in recent years, our company has put the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, vigorously promoted ideological revolutionization, and since 1963, has cultivated 23 company-level and above cadres, developed 93 party members, and in the past three years, 283 people have been rated as five-good soldiers, greatly promoting the revolutionary construction of the company.

Comrade Lin Biao's important speech at the capital's celebration meeting has given the representatives great encouragement. Many representatives said excitedly in the discussion that in the past 17 years, every victory of ours is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, Comrade Lin Biao has issued a new call to us, to unify the thoughts of the whole party and the thoughts of the people across the country with Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works across the country, and turn the whole country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, resolutely push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new and higher stage, accelerate the realization of ideological revolutionization, and achieve greater victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    林彪同志在首都庆祝大会上的重要讲话，给了代表们巨大的鼓舞。许多代表在座谈时激动地说，十七年来，我们每一个胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。现在，林彪同志又向我们发出了新的号召，用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全国人民群众的思想，进一步在全国开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把全国变成一个毛泽东思想的大学校。我们坚定不移地响应林彪同志的号召，坚决把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更高的新阶段，加速实现思想革命化，夺取社会主义革命和社会主义建设的更大胜利。（附图片）
