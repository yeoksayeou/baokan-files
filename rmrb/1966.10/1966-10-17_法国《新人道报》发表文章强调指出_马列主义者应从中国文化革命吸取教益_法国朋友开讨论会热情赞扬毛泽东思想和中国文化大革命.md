Paris, October 15, Xinhua News Agency: The organ of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists), "New Humanity," recently published an article titled "Long Live the Cultural Revolution," which enthusiastically praises China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article points out, "Chairman Mao's works embody the revolutionary experience of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time."

The article says, "The Cultural Revolution is a new stage in the development of China's socialist revolution, a great leap forward in culture. It has great educational significance for all genuine Marxist-Leninists around the world."

The article points out that the imperialist and modern revisionist press has gone into a frenzy of anti-China hysteria over the Cultural Revolution because "China is consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat." The article says, "History has shown us that the more violently and openly the bourgeoisie opposes communism, the more it indicates that communism is advancing."

The article says, French Marxist-Leninists should "scientifically analyze China's Cultural Revolution and draw various lessons for our struggle from it."

The article says, "We must wage an uncompromising struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the bourgeoisie in our country, and this struggle is inseparable from the ideological struggle within our ranks.

"The class struggle in society will be reflected within the ranks of the vanguard. To deny this is to betray the revolution, to open the door to all kinds of reactionary currents. We must take up our responsibility and do our utmost to Bolshevize our organization."

Paris, October 14, Xinhua News Agency: The France-China Friendship Association organized two discussion meetings on October 11 and 12 to introduce China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the meetings, several French friends who had recently visited China enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past few months, the broad masses of the French people have paid great attention to China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They eagerly hope to understand this great revolution. It is out of this sentiment that many French people participated in these two discussion meetings.

Workers, teachers, students, and doctors who spoke at the meetings all enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought in various fields. They pointed out, "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of our time," "China is the most solid bastion in the defense of peace," and "Chinese leaders trust the masses, they believe that the masses will carry the revolution through to the end."

Some speakers praised the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and refuted the slanders of Western and revisionist newspapers against the Red Guards' revolutionary actions. They said, "The Red Guards are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought," "The Red Guards follow the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army in their actions."

At the discussion meeting on October 12, a short film shot by a French friend during his visit to China was shown. The film recorded the scenes of Chinese revolutionary masses marching in support of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which was warmly welcomed by the participants of the discussion meeting. The Student Committee of the France-China Friendship Association also introduced the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a recently published special issue, and published an editorial titled "Long Live the Red Guards," praising the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards.

    法国《新人道报》发表文章强调指出
    马列主义者应从中国文化革命吸取教益
    法国朋友开讨论会热情赞扬毛泽东思想和中国文化大革命
    新华社十五日讯　巴黎消息：法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）机关报《新人道报》最近发表一篇题为《文化大革命万岁》的文章，热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章指出，“毛主席的著作体现了当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者的革命经验”。
    文章说：“文化大革命是中国社会主义革命发展过程中的新阶段，是文化的大跃进。它对全世界所有的真正的马克思列宁主义者都有巨大的教育意义。”
    文章指出，帝国主义和现代修正主义的报刊就中国文化大革命发出反华歇斯底里，这是因为“中国正在巩固无产阶级专政”。文章说：“历史已向我们证明，资产阶级越是粗暴地、越是公开地反对共产主义，就越表明共产主义在向前发展。”
    文章说，法国马克思列宁主义者应该“科学地分析中国的文化大革命，并从中吸取对我们斗争的各种教益”。
    文章说，“我们应该对帝国主义、修正主义和我国的资产阶级展开不调和的斗争，这种斗争同在我们队伍内部进行的意识形态斗争是分不开的。
    “社会上的阶级斗争会反映到先锋队队伍内部来。否认这一点，就是背弃革命，就是向各种逆流敞开大门。我们应当负起我们的责任，并竭尽全力使我们的组织布尔什维克化。”
    新华社巴黎十四日电　法中友好协会在十一日和十二日组织了两次介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的讨论会。在会上，几位最近访问过中国的法国朋友，热情赞扬毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命。
    几个月以来，法国广大群众对中国无产阶级文化大革命极为重视。他们殷切地希望了解这场大革命。正是出于这种感情，很多法国人参加了这两次讨论会。
    在会上发言的工人、教员、学生、医生都热烈赞扬中国人民在毛泽东思想指导下在各个方面取得的伟大胜利。他们指出：“毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义”，“中国是保卫和平的最坚固的堡垒”，“中国领导人信任人民群众，他们相信，人民群众会把革命进行到底”。
    一些发言的人赞扬了红卫兵的革命行动，并且驳斥了西方报刊和修正主义报刊对红卫兵革命行动的诽谤。他们说：“红卫兵是以马克思列宁主义理论和毛泽东思想武装起来的”，“红卫兵在他们的行动中遵守人民解放军的三大纪律和八项注意”。
    在十二日的讨论会上，放映了一位法国朋友在中国访问时拍摄的短电影，这个电影纪录了中国革命群众举行游行，坚决支持《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》的情景，受到参加讨论会的观众的热烈欢迎。法中友协大学生委员会在最近出版的一期特刊里，也介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命，并以《红卫兵万岁》为题发表社论，称赞中国红卫兵的革命行动。
