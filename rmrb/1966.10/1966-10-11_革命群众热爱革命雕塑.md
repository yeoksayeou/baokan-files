Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the masses of the people." In the exhibition hall of the large clay sculpture group "New Yu Gong Moves the Mountain," revolutionary masses enthusiastically praised the moving scenes of this group of clay sculptures, once again proving the great significance of Chairman Mao's teachings. The fact that the masses love "New Yu Gong Moves the Mountain" shows that as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, sculpture art, which was once deemed by bourgeois "authorities" as "unable to go to the countryside," can also become a powerful revolutionary literary and artistic weapon. It can play an important role in uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

On the first day of the official exhibition of "New Yu Gong Moves the Mountain" in Hanshui County, the entire exhibition hall was packed. The community members happily said that everyone had been eagerly waiting to "see the heroes and learn from the heroes." Many people had come to see it multiple times while it was being sculpted, and on the first day of the exhibition, they rushed back again. Some community members not only came themselves but also specially invited the cadres and community members from their own production teams and neighboring production teams to come and see it. The deputy chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association of Datong Commune, old poor peasant Jiang Sheng'an, and the over 80-year-old old community member Wang Yongqing said with great emotion: In the old society, sculptures were all of Buddhas, ghosts, and officials. The reactionary ruling class used them to propagate feudal superstitions, deceive us, oppress us, and try to make us never be able to rise up. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, sculptures of us poor and lower-middle peasants have now been created. This is truly a great revolution that has turned the world upside down. The over 70-year-old Luo Laomama from Fulin Commune, who was once sent to prison by the landlord for not being able to pay rent in the old society, recalled the painful past and said with great emotion: "In the old society, we suffered hardships, but we only knew how to burn incense and kowtow to the clay and wooden statues of Buddhas. After liberation, the Communist Party removed the stone slab that had been pressing on us, and Chairman Mao opened our eyes. Now, even I, a 70-year-old person, have come to understand how to farm for the revolution. The Party and Chairman Mao truly understand the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants! We must teach our children and grandchildren to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!"

In the exhibition hall where this newly completed group of clay sculptures is on display, there are no guides, and explanatory words have not yet been prepared. However, the broad masses of community members can fully understand it. They said, these are not ordinary sculptures, but the living history of the laboring people's selfless labor to build socialism, a textbook for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. What is sculpted here is not just a few dozen Datong community members, but representatives of the new-type farmers of the great era of Mao Zedong. It sculpts the spirit of the people of Dazhai, the people of Datong, and the revolutionary spirit of hundreds of millions of farmers across the country who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, praising the great struggle of hundreds of millions of farmers to change the world and build socialism.

Every cadre and community member of Datong Commune who participated in the mountain-cutting and dam-building project found these sculptures particularly familiar. They especially praised the centerpiece of this group of clay sculptures—the lively scene of community members studying Chairman Mao's works at the construction site. They believe that this group of sculptures deeply portrays the boundless love and faith of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, for Mao Zedong Thought, as well as their broad-minded concern for the country and vision for the world. Deputy Secretary of the Datong Commune Party Committee Liu Fuyin and Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Zhongba Production Team, the hero of "stone throwing and water interception" Liu Zhengwen said: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our Datong community members, the lifeblood of all revolutionary masses across the country. Our Datong Commune was built on Mao Zedong Thought. Our broad masses of community members have studied Chairman Mao's works, and have indeed changed their minds and transformed the land. Only by sculpting the enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works and making it lifelike can we reflect the new spiritual face of today's broad commune members!

Many community members, after visiting the exhibition, angrily refuted the slanders of the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" against the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: The anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois rightists slander us poor and lower-middle peasants as "selfish" and "ignorant," which is sheer nonsense! Let them come and see these sculptures! This is the heroic image of us broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants!

In this exhibition hall, there have also been many moving scenes of talking about heroes and learning from heroes. Although this group of clay sculptures depicts typical figures that have been generalized and refined, some community members believe that each sculpture is a real person, and they enthusiastically introduced to the people around them the advanced deeds of some real people they knew. They said, in the old society, Buddhas were sculpted to deceive people, but today heroes are sculpted to make us learn from heroes and unite to build socialism. The community members of Datong Commune also recounted many true stories of how these clay sculptures played a role in breaking old customs and establishing new ones. Returned educated youth Dai Daojiang and militia squad leader Wang Benxing said: These heroic sculptures are the greatest encouragement to us broad masses of community members. When we see them, we will follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and resolutely revolutionize to the end!

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically praised these sculptures, saying: This is the true art that laboring people need. This is a major achievement of the sculptors in seriously implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Deputy Secretary of the Datong Commune Party Committee Liu Fuyin, Team Leader Chen Linchun of the Third Production Team of Xinmin Production Brigade, and the young female pioneer of mountain-cutting and dam-building, community member Yang Zhenglian said: Chairman Mao once instructed all revolutionary literary and artistic workers, "They must go among the masses, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly, and must go into the midst of the fiery struggle." This time, these art workers are following Chairman Mao's words and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. If they had always stayed in the city and locked themselves in a small room, they would never have been able to sculpt the revolutionary spirit of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

After visiting this group of clay sculptures, many community members unanimously said that now the broad countryside is full of a revolutionary atmosphere, and a new all-around leap-forward situation is emerging everywhere, with many new heroes and heroic deeds worth singing about. They hope that more revolutionary literary and artistic workers will, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, come to the countryside, come to the poor and lower-middle peasants, come to the midst of the fiery struggle, and create more and better literary and artistic works in various forms. They said: Troupes should perform more heroic stories of poor and lower-middle peasants, writers should write more heroic figures of poor and lower-middle peasants, and only in this way can our various literary and artistic works, as Chairman Mao pointed out, awaken the people, inspire them, and push the people to unite and struggle, to transform their environment.

    革命群众热爱革命雕塑
    毛主席说：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”在大型泥塑群像《大树新愚公》的展览馆里，广大革命群众热烈赞扬这组泥塑群像的许多动人情景，又一次证明毛主席这一教导的伟大意义。群众热爱《大树新愚公》的事实表明，只要坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺方向，过去被资产阶级“权威”断定为“不能下乡”的雕塑艺术，同样能成为有力的革命文艺武器，在团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人中，发挥出重要的作用。
    《大树新愚公》在汉源县正式展出的第一天，整个展览厅里就挤得水泄不通。社员们高兴地说，大家早就盼望着来“看英雄，学英雄”了。有许多人还在塑像时就来看过多次，第一天展出，他们又赶来了。一些社员不仅自己看了，还特地邀来自己生产队和邻近生产队的干部、社员一起看。大树公社贫协筹委会副主席、老贫农姜生安和八十多岁的老社员王永清，万分激动地说：旧社会的塑像都是菩萨鬼怪和官老爷，反动统治阶级用它来宣传封建迷信，欺骗我们，压迫我们，妄想使我们永世翻不了身。在共产党和毛主席领导下，现在塑出了我们贫下中农的像，这真是一场天翻地覆的大革命。富林公社七十多岁的罗老大娘，解放前付不清欠租，曾被地主送进监狱。她回忆起了惨痛的往事，心情激动地说：“旧社会我们受苦受难，却只晓得给泥塑木雕的菩萨烧香、磕头。解放了，共产党把压在我们身上的石板掀掉了，毛主席把我们的眼睛擦亮了，如今就连我这个七十多岁的人，也明白了为革命种田。党和毛主席硬是懂得我们贫下中农的心呵！我们一定要教子子孙孙永远跟毛主席闹革命！”
    在展出这组新完成的泥塑群像的展览厅里，没有解说员，也还来不及拟出说明词。但是，广大社员群众完全看得懂。他们说，这不是一些普普通通的塑像，而是劳动人民忘我劳动建设社会主义的活历史，是活学活用毛泽东思想的教科书。这里塑的决不仅仅是几十个大树社员，而是伟大毛泽东时代的新型农民的代表。它塑出了大寨人，大树人，以及全国各地用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万农民的革命气概，歌颂了亿万农民为建设社会主义而进行的改天换地的伟大斗争。
    曾经参加过劈山修堰的大树公社的每一个干部和社员，看到这些塑像更是分外亲切。他们特别赞赏这组泥塑的中心——社员们在工地学习毛主席著作的热烈场景。他们认为，这组塑像深刻地表现出用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农社员，对毛泽东思想的无限热爱和信仰，以及他们心怀祖国，放眼世界的广阔胸怀。大树公社党委副书记刘福银，中坝大队党支部副书记、“投石截流”的英雄刘正文说：毛泽东思想是我们大树社员的命根子，是我们全国革命群众的命根子。我们大树公社就是靠毛泽东思想起家的。我们广大社员学习了毛主席著作，硬是人换了思想，地换了新装。只有把学习毛主席著作的热情塑出来，塑得传神，才能反映出今天广大公社社员新的思想面貌！
    许多社员参观后还愤怒驳斥了资产阶级反动“权威”诬蔑广大贫下中农的种种谬论。他们说：反党反社会主义的资产阶级右派分子诬蔑我们贫下中农“自私”、“愚昧”，简直是胡说八道！叫他们来看看这些塑像吧！这就是我们广大贫下中农的英雄形象！
    在这个展览厅里，还出现过许多谈英雄、学英雄的动人场面。虽然这组泥塑塑的都是经过概括提炼的典型人物，但是，有的社员却认为每一个塑像都是一个真实人物，并且滔滔不绝地向身旁的人们介绍他所知道的一些真实人物的先进事迹。他们说，旧社会塑菩萨是为了骗人，今天塑英雄是要我们向英雄学习，齐心建设社会主义。大树公社社员们还讲述了这些泥塑起到了破旧俗、立新风作用的许多真实故事。回乡知识青年戴道刚、民兵排长王本兴说：这些英雄塑像对我们广大社员是个最大的鼓舞，我们看见它，就会朝着毛主席指引的方向，坚决革命到底！
    广大贫下中农热烈赞扬这些塑像，他们说：这才是我们劳动人民需要的真正的艺术。这是雕塑工作者们认真贯彻执行毛主席文艺方向的一个重大成果，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。大树公社党委副书记刘福银，新民大队第三生产队队长陈林春，劈山修堰女闯将、青年社员杨正莲说：毛主席曾经指示一切革命文艺工作者，“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”。这一次，这些美术工作者就是听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事的。假如他们老是住在城里，关在小屋里，他们是绝不会塑出我们贫下中农的革命精神来的。
    在参观这组泥塑以后，许多社员一致谈到，现在广大农村到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，到处出现了新的全面跃进的局面，值得歌颂的新的英雄人物和英雄事迹，实在太多了。他们希望有更多的革命文艺工作者，按照毛主席的指示，到农村中来，到贫下中农中来，到火热的斗争中来，创造更多更好的各种形式的文艺作品。他们说：剧团应该多演贫下中农的英雄故事，作家应该多写贫下中农的英雄人物，只有这样，我们的各种文艺作品才能像毛主席指出的那样，使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，推动人民群众走向团结和斗争，实行改造自己的环境。　新华社记者
