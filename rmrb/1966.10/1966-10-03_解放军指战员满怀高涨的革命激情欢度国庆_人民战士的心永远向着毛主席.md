People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, filled with surging revolutionary enthusiasm, joyfully celebrated the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. While vigilantly defending the motherland, they celebrated with boundless joy and high revolutionary fervor.

On the morning of October 1st, the broad masses of officers and soldiers, with deep affection for Chairman Mao, gathered around loudspeakers and radios to listen to the broadcast from Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The unprecedented grandeur of Tiananmen Square was conveyed through the airwaves, inspiring the soldiers' hearts. At 10:00 AM, the solemn melody of "The East Is Red" played over the loudspeakers. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, ascended the Tiananmen rostrum to celebrate the 17th anniversary of New China with 1.5 million revolutionary masses from the capital and from all over the country. At that moment, the atmosphere reached its peak on the front lines, in high mountain and dense forest outposts, at naval docks, air force bases, and throughout the vast military camps. Soldiers waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" A model soldier from a certain unit stationed on a high mountain top on an island off the coast of Fujian said, "Though we are on the island, our hearts are in Beijing. Beijing is right here with us, and Chairman Mao is right here with us. The hearts of revolutionary soldiers will forever be with Chairman Mao!"

After listening to Comrade Lin Biao's speech at the national celebration in Beijing, many units of the navy, air force, and the Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Beijing, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Jinan military regions held discussions. They enthusiastically talked about the glorious victories achieved in socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past 17 years under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, and about their own growth under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary spirit was greatly inspired. The officers and soldiers of a certain ship in the navy, which Chairman Mao visited 13 years ago, were excited to say that the glorious achievements of our great motherland over the past 17 years were all achieved under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao wrote on our ship 13 years ago, "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must build a powerful navy." Our navy has developed and grown stronger under Chairman Mao's instructions. Now Chairman Mao teaches us to care about state affairs and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and firmly act according to his instructions, holding a gun in one hand and a pen in the other, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, defending our great motherland, and ensuring that the iron-clad socialist mountains and rivers will never change color. Many officers and soldiers in the units also unanimously expressed that in his speech at the national celebration in Beijing, Vice Chairman Lin Biao once again called on us to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country with Mao Zedong Thought, turning the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We firmly respond to this, firmly support it, and will definitely carry it out.

On this glorious day, many units in Lanzhou, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet held various forms of celebration meetings, report meetings, and discussion meetings. Many companies also held National Day cultural evenings or military-civilian joint celebrations. Thousands of songs and tens of thousands of melodies had one theme: praising the great Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    据新华社二日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，在警惕地保卫着祖国的同时，怀着无限的喜悦和高涨的革命激情，热烈欢庆中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    十月一日清晨，广大指战员怀着对毛主席无限热爱的深情，集队在广播喇叭下，围坐在收音机旁，收听从北京天安门广场发出的声音。天安门广场的空前盛况随着电波传到全国各地，振奋着战士们的心。十时整，广播喇叭里传出庄严的《东方红》乐曲声，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席登上天安门城楼，同一百五十万首都和来自全国各地的革命群众一起庆祝新中国成立十七周年。这时，在前沿阵地，高山密林哨所，在海军码头、空军机场和广大营区，沸腾的气氛达到了顶点，战士们挥动着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，放开喉咙，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”驻守在福建前线某岛高山顶上的某部五好战士汪长牙说：“我们身在海岛，心向北京。北京就在我们身边，毛主席就在我们身边。革命战士的心永远向着毛主席！”
    海军、空军和广州、沈阳、南京、北京、武汉、成都、济南等部队许多连队指战员，收听林彪同志在首都庆祝大会的讲话以后，纷纷举行座谈，畅谈祖国十七年来，在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的辉煌胜利，畅谈自己在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的历程，革命精神大大发扬。毛主席十三年前到过的海军某舰的指战员们激动地说，我们伟大祖国十七年来所取得的辉煌成就，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛主席十三年前在我们舰上亲笔题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”我们海军部队，按照毛主席的指示，发展了，壮大了。现在毛主席又教导我们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们一定要听毛主席的话，坚决按毛主席指示办事，一手拿枪，一手拿笔，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保卫我们伟大的祖国，让社会主义铁打的江山永不变色。许多部队指战员在座谈时还一致表示：林彪副主席在首都庆祝大会讲话中再次号召我们，用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想、全国人民的思想，把全国变成毛泽东思想的大学校。对此我们坚决响应、坚决拥护、坚决照办。
    在光辉的节日里，兰州、内蒙古、新疆、西藏等部队许多单位，都分别举行了各种形式的庆祝会、报告会、座谈会，许多连队还举行了国庆文艺晚会或军民联欢会，千歌万曲一个主题，歌颂伟大的毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
