Our team's victory in the bloody battle against the raging fire is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This victory occurred during the high tide of all workers in the entire war zone studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a powerful response to the handful of bourgeois right-wing elements and all the ghosts and demons who are anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

Our team has been consistently studying Chairman Mao's works over the past few years. Last winter, we conducted a comprehensive training session, focusing on class education and promoting the image of proletarian revolutionary heroes. We launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, we promoted the revolutionization of the leadership cadre and deepened the ideological revolution of all team members. The entire team has formed a habit of voluntarily studying Chairman Mao's works, with everyone using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, treating Chairman Mao's books as their guide for everything. Especially after the training, when the leadership conveyed Chairman Mao's great call to the petroleum workers to find gas and oil, the revolutionary spirit of the workers was greatly inspired. Comrades said, "This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and encouragement for us. We must quickly find the gas and oil to repay Chairman Mao's concern for us. Even if we lose a few pounds of flesh or shed a few layers of skin, we will not complete the task of finding gas and oil until we die on the drilling platform, buried under the oil field."

The next morning, we received a new mission and set out for a new area. The entire team, carrying Chairman Mao's highest directive to find gas and oil, with boundless love and loyalty to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, took the People's Liberation Army as an example, learned from the revolutionary spirit of hard work and perseverance of the Daqing people, and completed the first exploratory well at a speed three times faster than before in just over a month. We finally found this "big gas tiger," discovering a high-pressure, high-yield gas field, and dealt a heavy blow to those bourgeois "authorities" who slandered this structure as having no oil or gas.

To capture this "gas tiger," we followed Chairman Mao's teachings of not fighting unprepared battles and not fighting battles without certainty. We conducted a series of well-completion preparations. On the afternoon of June 21, we began closing the well to build pressure, preparing to change the wellhead the next day. At 1:00 AM on June 22, while measuring the pressure, due to this being the first exploratory well drilled in a new structure, the geological conditions were unclear, and the well's production was particularly high, with the natural gas pressure also particularly high, nearly double that of nearby old gas wells. This caused the wellhead's gas outlet pipe to suddenly explode, breaking the explosion-proof lights and immediately igniting a sky-high fire. The powerful natural gas flow roared, and the fierce flames crossed the wellhead and machine room, shooting out over fifty meters. The sound could be heard twenty miles away, and the fire could be seen forty miles away. The flames reached the opposite hillside and rolled back, with fire waves rolling back and forth, reaching over thirty meters high. The fifty-meter-wide well site became a sea of fire, and the forty-meter-high steel drilling rig was burned down in three minutes. The machine room's equipment quickly turned into lumps of iron, and the opposite hillside was also burned red, with trees turning into charcoal. This was an unprecedentedly large fire.

The raging fire seriously threatened the safety of the wellhead and the lives of over a hundred class brothers. If the wellhead exploded, the high-pressure, high-yield gas well would be ruined, destroying this gas field and causing incalculable losses to state property. At this critical moment, all team members thought only of Chairman Mao's highest directive, considering revolutionary interests as their first life. Workers resting in the dormitory, upon hearing the explosion at the well site, rushed towards it with all their might. They jumped over ditches and leaped over obstacles, reaching the well site in less than a minute to engage in a fierce battle against the flames. At that moment, we had only one belief: no matter how big the fire, it was not as great as the spirit of the petroleum workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how fierce the fire, it was not as fierce as our fighting spirit. To defend Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we dared to climb mountains of swords and leap into seas of fire.

Before the pipeline exploded and caught fire, the off-duty fourth shift workers were still changing the leaking number one valve. Just as they were about to tighten the last screw, the pipeline exploded. They immediately joined the firefighting battle. The on-duty first shift workers also firmly guarded their posts. These two shifts of workers did not think of their personal safety but of protecting state property from loss. With the firm revolutionary will to extinguish the raging fire, they fearlessly rushed into the fire to rescue state property.

At that time, the gas flow and fire waves were extremely fierce. Covering oneself with a wet quilt, it would be burned in a few seconds. Pouring cold water into the fire would instantly turn it into boiling water. However, we were petroleum soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, thinking only of the Party's cause, not considering personal life or death. Comrades saw where the danger was and rushed towards it. Where the situation was most critical, they rushed in. Those who fell were followed by others who rushed forward. They fearlessly faced danger and fought bravely.

Deputy Commander Zhang Zhongmin of the Mining Area Party Committee, who was working on-site, led everyone into the fire. After being seriously injured and carried out of the well site, Zhang Zhongmin anxiously shouted, "Quick, quick, quick! Close the number three valve!" Despite his burns, he staggered back into the well site, rushing into the fire to close the number three valve. The number three valve was in the heart of the fire. Closing it would cut off the gas source and extinguish the fire. At that moment, two comrades from the Drilling Engineering Brigade carried him onto a car and pressed him down, not allowing him to re-enter the fire scene. Zhang Zhongmin kept shouting, "Let me go! I want to save the well, save the comrades! Quick, save the well and comrades!"

When the pipeline exploded, three comrades were changing the valve at the well site. Xu Yongmao and Huang Chenghou, who were lifting the valve, were blown over two meters into a ditch. Xu Yongmao immediately jumped up and rushed towards the wellhead. Huang Chenghou, blown over next to the water valve, tried to crawl up to open the water valve. Before his hand touched the valve, the flames engulfed him from behind, burning his face, back, and arms. Despite the intense pain, he still reached out to open the water valve.

The fire could destroy steel and iron, but the revolutionary spirit could not be conquered by the flames. The fierce flames could never burn away our loyal hearts to Chairman Mao and the Party. At that time, the fire was immense, and the natural gas roar deafened everyone's ears. No one could hear each other's voices, and no one could see each other's faces. Time did not allow for any hesitation or discussion. However, everyone thought only of the Party's cause, working together to rush towards the well site and rescue state property. Everyone felt that Chairman Mao was by our side, and Mao Zedong Thought was guiding our battle.

Deputy Political Instructor Lei Hongbin led the third shift to the well site. He fearlessly rushed into the fire, carrying a wet quilt. Before he could get close, he was pushed back by the fierce fire waves to a hillside about ten meters away. He stood up and turned to see that the wet quilt on his head had been blown away. The heat from the fire made him uncomfortable, but he clearly thought, "As a commander, the more critical the moment, the more calm and wise one must be. Personal bravery alone is not enough; one must rely on the power of the masses, understand the gas source, and cut off the gas flow to conquer this great fire." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, "The correct deployment of a commander comes from a correct decision, a correct decision comes from a correct judgment, a correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance, and from the comprehensive and necessary thinking about various reconnaissance materials," he observed and judged the well site, discovering that the gas flow was coming from the bend of the vent pipe between the number three and number four valves. The number three valve had to be closed to cut off the gas source. Thus, he led the comrades to rush towards the number three valve. Due to the fierce gas flow and intense fire, he was knocked down again. Comrades pulled him out. When he woke up, he wisely thought, "If we cannot approach the number three valve, we must find another strategy, open the number eight and number five valves to vent, and guide part of the natural gas out of the well site to reduce the fire's intensity, making it easier to close the number three valve." Therefore, he rushed into the fire for the second time, using a crowbar to insert it into the valve. As soon as the wheel turned two circles, he was knocked down by hydrogen sulfide. The following comrades immediately pulled him out of the fire. Lei Hongbin woke up again, thinking about the number eight valve still not being opened, trying to crawl up to open it. However, he felt dizzy and weak. He tried to stand up once, twice, three times... but could not. At that moment, the golden words of Chairman Mao flashed before his eyes, "This army possesses an unyielding spirit, it will trample all enemies, and will never be subdued by enemies. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's directive gave him endless strength, and he stood up, staggering towards the number eight valve. Several comrades held him back, gesturing, "You cannot go anymore! We will go!" Lei Hongbin firmly said, "Time waits for no one. If we rush, we rush together. If we die, we die together. We must die on the battlefield and protect the gas well." With the protection of Wang Youfa and Tian Huaolu's water hoses, he and the comrades rushed into the fire together, finally opening the number eight valve, guiding part of the natural gas out, and reducing the fire's intensity.

We are petroleum workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, not only the bravest and most intelligent but also the most united and harmonious. Comrades, in the face of this great fire, fearlessly fought bravely, closely cooperated, and protected each other. When Lei Hongbin and others were opening the number eight valve, Peng Jiaji led Hu Debin and others, carrying quilts and protected by water hoses, rushing into the fire to open the number five valve. Due to the fierce fire, they rushed five times but were pushed out by the strong gas flow. At that moment, team leader Zhou Wenhua pulled a large wooden board, protected by the water hose, blocking the fierce fire, and gained a few seconds. I and the comrades rushed forward together, finally opening the number five valve. After the number eight and number five vent valves were opened, part of the natural gas was guided out of the well site, and the fire's intensity in the well site slightly decreased. However, if the number three valve was not closed, the wellhead still had the risk of exploding...

At that moment, all comrades concentrated their strength to attack the number three valve. Deputy Driller Wang Youfa, who was originally near the number three valve, used the water hose to protect comrades from closing the number three valve. Seeing some comrades being carried out, he immediately handed the water hose to others and rushed up to join the battle to close the number three valve. He and Hu Debin and more than ten comrades, carrying wet quilts, shouted in unison, "Quick! Quick! Rush up to close the valve!" However, the valve had been deformed by the fire. Those who rushed up grabbed the red-hot wheel, and everyone exerted their strength, changing two large wrenches, finally closing the number three valve.

Although the gas source was cut off and the fire in the well site weakened, the wellhead was deformed by the fire, and a large amount of natural gas was still spraying from the leaking points of the sealing wellhead and the four-way pipe, with the pressure rising rapidly. The risk of the wellhead exploding was increasing. All team members and comrades from the Drilling Engineering Brigade who rushed to extinguish the fire, despite their injuries and fatigue, rushed towards the wellhead for the final battle to protect the wellhead. Deputy Driller Wang Youfa grabbed a wet quilt, covering the wellhead. In less than a minute, the quilt was burned through. He turned and grabbed a second wet quilt, wrapping it around his body, shouting, "Burn, burn!" Like Huang Jiguang blocking the enemy's machine gun nest, he bravely rushed into the burning flames, pressing the quilt and himself onto the fire mouth until he fainted from poisoning. Comrades rescued him. When he woke up, seeing the fire still not extinguished, he tried to struggle up. Several comrades tightly held him down. He anxiously shouted, "Quick, let me go! Let me go! I am a worker, the master of the state. As long as I have a breath, I will fight to the end with the fire! I cannot bear to see state property being damaged!" Wang Youfa shook off the hands holding him and rushed into the burning drilling platform. Everyone also rushed towards the wellhead, using more than thirty wet quilts to press down the fire, finally extinguishing it.

During this battle, the visiting family member of a comrade, Mou Maoxiu, the wife of the collector worker Heng Shusu, showed a high level of selflessness. During the firefighting, someone told her twice, "Little Mou, your husband is burned! Go take care of your husband!" She felt heartbroken but immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, "To fight is to have sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence." She thought, "Now, saving state property is the most important, and extinguishing the fire is the most important. Even if my husband falls, the fire has not been extinguished, I must continue the battle." She endured her inner pain, wiped her tears, and continued to rescue injured comrades, carry heavy crystal powder, and send wet quilts until the battle ended.

Deputy Driller Zhang Yongqing, a member of the Communist Party, was responsible for inspecting the pipelines. Two hours before his martyrdom, he was still studying Chairman Mao's works. After going on duty, he told the on-duty comrades, "Comrades, we always want to catch the 'gas tiger.' Now the 'gas tiger' is about to be caught by us. We must dare to struggle and dare to win. Tonight is the night to close the well and build pressure. The pressure rises quickly. Everyone must strengthen inspections and be one hundred percent responsible to the Party and the people, focusing on the wellhead. Even if there are problems, we must guard our posts." When the pipeline exploded, he rushed straight towards the number four valve, trying to open the valve to vent, guiding the natural gas out of the well site. Despite the explosion's flame shooting out over fifty meters, he fearlessly rushed into the fire, fighting against the flames. Due to the intense fire, he did not reach his destination and heroically sacrificed his life.

Zhang Yongqing, during his lifetime, was an excellent example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He read Chairman Mao's books most seriously, executed Chairman Mao's directives most resolutely, and transformed himself most thoroughly. He said, "A knife is not sharp without grinding, water does not boil without heating, and a person cannot become a revolutionary without studying Chairman Mao's works." He was always fearless of hardship and death, lived a simple life, and cared for his comrades. He often said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to serve all the people in China and the world. We drill wells and travel all over the world for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution." His body was not good, with severe stomach problems and sore throat. Sometimes, several diseases attacked him simultaneously, but he still persisted in working. When the pain was unbearable, he would support his stomach with his hand or squat for a while before continuing to work. Comrades were all moved by his strong will and tenacious revolutionary spirit, saying he was a good worker like Jiao Yulu.

Wang Ping, who had just been transferred from a brother team, was the son of a poor peasant. In the old society, he was forced into poverty, with his family destroyed and siblings separated, changing his name until 1964 when the Party and the government helped him find his biological parents. With boundless love for the Party and deep hatred for class enemies, seeing Zhang Yongqing fall, he fearlessly rushed towards the number four valve. He had not taken a few steps when he was knocked down by the fire wave, struggling up to rush towards the number three valve, also heroically sacrificing his life.

Wang Ping always loved reading Chairman Mao's books. He often said, "Even if a person lives to be a hundred years old, they will still die. It depends on how they die. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, die for the people's interests, and die with meaning, heavier than Mount Tai."

Drillers Luo Huatai and Wang Zuming, in the sea of fire, fearlessly and bravely fought, always guarding their posts to protect state property and the gas field. After their martyrdom, they still maintained the posture of rushing to close the valve and protect the pressure gauge, fully embodying their loyalty to great Mao Zedong Thought, loyalty to the Party, and high responsibility for the revolution.

Assistant driver and Young Communist League member Wu Zhongqi bravely rushed into the fire to press the iron switch, intending to start the east pump to extinguish the fire. Suddenly, a fierce flame came from behind, knocking him down and causing him to sacrifice his life heroically.

In this firefighting and well-protection battle, five comrades heroically sacrificed their lives, and twenty-two comrades were honorably injured. We are deeply saddened by the loss of our close comrades. They sacrificed their lives for the Party and the people to save state property. They died gloriously, died worthily, died heavier than Mount Tai.

When the car sent the injured comrades to the hospital for rescue, many comrades still thought of extinguishing the fire, protecting the well, and rescuing class brothers, not thinking of themselves. Comrade Wang Cunyu, with severe injuries and both eyes burned, could not see. On the way to the hospital, he kept saying, "We must act according to Chairman Mao's directives... Mao Zedong's petroleum soldiers have no insurmountable difficulties... Persistence is victory!" The comrades escorting the injured saw them injured so badly and heard their heart-moving words, moved to tears.

The injured comrades were honorably injured for the Party and the people's cause. The great Party and the great leader Chairman Mao showed us boundless care, sending the best doctors, the best medicines, and various medical equipment within a few hours. From the central to local governments, many relevant departments provided the fastest support and rescue. Within a day, more than twenty medical units and 133 medical staff rushed to the hospital, forming a burn rescue center team under the leadership of the county Party committee, quickly starting the rescue work.

The workers of the mining area, family members, and local people, after hearing the news of comrades bravely protecting the well and being honorably injured, constantly cared about the comrades' injuries. They firmly declared to the Party, "The injured need what we give what, need skin we donate skin, the injured need how much blood we donate how much blood!" A poor peasant walked eighty miles to the hospital and donated 300 milliliters of blood. During the entire rescue process, more than 900 people donated blood to the injured.

The Party and the people's boundless care for the injured gave the comrades great encouragement and strength. The injured comrades, in the hospital, still insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, fighting against severe burns, fully demonstrating the revolutionary heroism of the proletariat.

Comrade Deng Mufu, with 85% of his body burned, never cried out in pain. Deputy Political Instructor Lei Hongbin visited him, bringing "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and he was so happy that he cried, saying in a small voice, "Thank you, Party and Chairman Mao, for your care. I really miss you, Chairman Mao. I need to hear your words the most." The nurse took the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from him, and he told the nurse, "In the future, read more to me. I will definitely act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and I can endure any difficulty." Whenever he was tortured by pain, he asked the nurse to read him "In Memory of Norman Bethune" or "Serve the People." When he was tortured by pain, he would ask the nurse to read him "In Memory of Norman Bethune" or "Serve the People."

Due to Deng Mufu's severe injuries, the doctor took all measures to rescue him in vain. When Deng Mufu was about to stop breathing, he still remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, using all his strength to say, "According to... Chairman Mao's... words... do..." As soon as he finished, he bid farewell to everyone forever. Deng Mufu was like this, infinitely loving Chairman Mao, infinitely loving the Party. In his soul, there was only great Mao Zedong Thought, and in his mind, he always thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. He was truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao and an excellent son of the Party and the people. He will forever live in our hearts.

Comrade Ran Shurong, a model worker of the Petroleum Industry Ministry, had 52.7% of his body burned, with most of it being deep burns. Despite the severe burns and the torture of the disease, his revolutionary will was unshakable. After being admitted to the hospital, as soon as he woke up, he asked the nurse to place Chairman Mao's portrait at his bedside and read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles. Once, students came to visit him, seeing him endure so much pain while changing dressings, they cried out of sadness. Ran Shurong asked the doctor, "Who is crying?" The doctor said, "It's the students who came to see you." Ran Shurong said, "Come, don't cry! Let's sing 'The East Is Red' together." Comrades asked him, "Comrade Ran, you are burned so badly, why haven't we heard you moan?" He said, "Mai Xian, in the battlefield, suffered a serious head injury but still fought on. I want to learn his spirit of perseverance and be a strong soldier of Chairman Mao." It was with this spirit that he lay in bed for over forty days, unable to turn his body. Even when he was unconscious, he never forgot Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. He kept saying, "Chairman Mao, I miss you so much!" In his unconsciousness, he kept shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" The doctor was inspired and said to him, "Old Ran, we are doctors sent by Chairman Mao. This is the medicine given by Chairman Mao, eat it quickly!" He heard this and immediately ate it wholeheartedly. From then on, he treated eating water and eating medicine as political tasks to complete. When he was in great pain, he shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!" and repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's teachings, "Make up your mind, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He said, "I, Ran Shurong, will strive for victory." Comrade Ran Shurong, even when his injuries were very severe, always thought of the great leader Chairman Mao. He was like this, infinitely loving, believing, and worshipping Chairman Mao.

All the injured comrades, like Comrade Ran Shurong, dared to climb mountains of swords and leap into seas of fire to rescue state property. In the hospital, they could also overcome severe burns, fully demonstrating the spirit of the petroleum workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Medical teams from all over the country, carrying the Party's entrustment and the people's expectations, spared no effort to rescue class brothers. They said, "The brave fighters were injured while rescuing state property. We must save the lives of our class brothers." Under the Party and the people's great rescue efforts, twenty-one injured comrades have fully or basically recovered their health. The Party and Chairman Mao gave the injured comrades a second life. A thousand words, ten thousand words, cannot express our inner feelings. A thousand excitements, ten thousand excitements, cannot express our boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. Comrades expressed that for the revolutionary cause, even if they were to be crushed to pieces, they could not repay the Party and Chairman Mao's kindness! Every time we think of this, we are moved to tears. We shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!"

In this battle to fight the fire and protect the gas well, why did comrades fearlessly face the fire, remain calm, have one heart, one spirit, and rush forward, extinguishing the sky-high fire in just thirty minutes? The fundamental reason is that Mao Zedong Thought armed our minds. We treat reading Chairman Mao's books as our first need in life, turning Mao Zedong Thought into our souls, turning the execution of Chairman Mao's directives into conscious actions, and treating revolutionary interests as our first life.

Most comrades in our team come from worker and peasant families, and many are demobilized soldiers from the People's Liberation Army. We have boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and the Party. Over the past few years, all comrades in the team have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. One-third of the comrades have written nearly ten thousand words of diaries. We study Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the details, learning a bit and using a bit, learning a sentence and using a sentence. Every time we launch an activity, conduct work, or encounter difficulties in production, or solve someone's ideological problems, we study Chairman Mao's works. We have formed a habit of studying quotations before work, hanging quotations by the bed, studying quotations during meetings, reciting quotations during conversations, and comparing work with quotations. Comrades say, "From the dormitory to the well site, Chairman Mao's quotations shine with gold, seeing quotations on the road, the road is bright, seeing quotations at work, the body is full of strength, seeing quotations everywhere, the heart rises with the red sun." We have Chairman Mao's words "printed in our minds, melted in our blood, and realized in our actions." When encountering difficulties, we think of Chairman Mao's words, and our spirits rise, our confidence is full, our efforts are great, and no difficulties are insurmountable. This victory is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

In our rescue of the gas well, we have achieved some results. The great leader Chairman Mao and the great Party have shown us boundless concern and given us the highest honor. The achievements should be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao, to great Mao Zedong Thought, and to the great Party. In the future, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implement Comrade Lin Biao's recent directives, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and exert our greatest efforts to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives. We will forever take the People's Liberation Army as an example, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people, forever be humble and cautious, and temper ourselves into a braver, stronger, more united, and more selfless petroleum worker team. We will build our team into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, use the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, seize the revolution and promote production, drill more wells, drill quickly, drill well, and produce more oil and gas to drown the American imperialists and suffocate the old revisionists. We will respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's concern with practical actions and respond to the concern of the people across the country for us.

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力
    ——32111英雄钻井队副队长刘守荣在首都革命群众大会上的报告摘要
    我们队奋不顾身血战火海的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这次胜利出现在全战区职工活学活用毛主席著作高潮中，出现在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，这是给那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的一小撮资产阶级右派分子和一切牛鬼蛇神的有力回击。
      我们队，几年来一直坚持学习毛主席著作。去年冬季，我们又进行了整训，大抓了阶级教育，大树了无产阶级革命英雄形象，又掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。通过毛主席著作学习，促进了领导班子的革命化，加深了全队职工的思想革命化。全队形成了自觉地学习毛主席著作风气，人人用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动，把毛主席的书当作我们一切行动的指南。特别是在整训后期，领导上传达了毛主席对石油工人发出的找气找油的伟大号召以后，职工的革命精神更是十分振奋。同志们说，这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。大家摩拳擦掌，都说，一定要快快找出油、气来，报答毛主席他老人家对我们的关怀。那怕是掉几斤肉，脱几层皮，不完成找气找油任务死也要死在钻台上，埋也要埋在油田下。
      第二天的上午，我们就接受了新任务，出发到新的地区。全队职工带着毛主席的找气找油的最高指示，怀着对党中央和毛主席的无限热爱和无限忠诚，带着对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的深仇大恨，以解放军为榜样，学习大庆人艰苦创业穷干硬上的革命精神，用比以往快三倍的速度，一个多月就钻完了第一口探井。终于找到了这个大“气老虎”，获得了一个高压、高产大气田，狠狠地打击了那些污蔑这个构造没有油、气的资产阶级“权威”。
    为了逮住这个“气老虎”，我们遵照毛主席不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗的教导，进行了一系列的完井准备工作。在六月二十一日下午，开始关井求压，准备第二天换井口。在二十二日晨一点钟正在测压时，由于这是在新的构造上打的第一口探井，地层情况还不清楚，这口井的产量又特别大，天然气压力也特别高，比附近老气井的压力，高出将近一倍，致使井口的出气管道突然爆炸，冲破了防爆灯，立即引起了冲天大火。强大的天然气流哇哇直叫，凶猛的大火横穿井口和机房，冲出五十多米远，二十里外听见响声，四十里外看见火光。火焰冲到对面的山坡上，又倒卷过来，火浪来回翻滚，高达三十多米。五十多米方圆的井场，成了一片火海，四十多米高的钢铁井架，三分钟就被烧倒了。机房的设备，很快烧成一团团的铁疙瘩，对面的山坡也被火烧红了，树木烧成了木炭。这是一场从来没有见到过的大火。
    烈火严重地威胁着井口的安全，威胁着一百多名阶级兄弟的生命。井口要是爆炸了，高压高产大气井就要报废，就会破坏这个大气田，使国家财产遭到无法估计的损失。在这个紧急关头，全队职工一心想的是毛主席的最高指示，把革命利益看成自己的第一生命。在宿舍休息的职工，当听到了井场爆炸声，拚命地往井场上冲。他们逢沟跳沟，逢坎跳坎，不到一分钟，全部奔到井场，与烈火展开了一场大恶战。当时我们只有一个信念，火再大，没有用毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人的志气大，火再猛，没有我们石油工人的斗志猛。为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。
    管线爆炸着火之前，已经下班的四班全体同志，还在继续换刺漏的一号闸门，刚要穿上最后一颗螺丝，管线就发生爆炸，他们马上投入到灭火的战斗中去。刚上班的一班同志，也坚守在自己的岗位上。这两个班的同志，他们想到的不是个人的生命安危，而是保护国家财产不受损失，他们抱着一定要扑灭烈火的坚强革命意志，与烈火展开了生死搏斗，不顾一切，扑进火海，抢救国家财产。
    当时，气流火浪凶得很，顶着湿棉被子，几秒钟就烧焦了，冷水一泼进去，马上就变成了沸汤。但是，我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的石油战士，一心想的是党的事业，根本不考虑个人生死。同志们看到哪里有危险，就往哪里冲，哪里最关键，就往哪里闯。前面的人倒下去了，后面的人又冲了上去。前赴后继，临危不惧。
    正在现场工作的矿区党委委员、副指挥兼总工程师张仲珉同志，带头领着大家冲进火海。当他身负重伤被同志背出井场后，张仲珉着急地呼喊：“快，快，快！……快关住三号闸门！”他不顾烧伤的疼痛，偏偏倒倒又扑进井场，冲进火海，抢关三号闸门。三号闸门在火海中心。关住三号闸门就可以切断气源，把火扑灭。这时，两个钻前工程团的同志，又把他背上汽车，把他按在车上，不让他再进火场。张仲珉不住地叫着：“放了我啊！我要去救井、救同志……！快，快救井救同志要紧……”
    管线爆炸的时候，有三个同志正在井场换装闸门，抬着闸门的许永茂和黄成厚一下被天然气冲倒到两米多远的水沟里。许永茂同志立刻一跃而起，往井口冲去。黄成厚被冲倒在水闸门旁边，他想爬起来去开水闸门，手还没有挨着闸门，烈火从他背后袭来，面部、背部和手臂都被烧坏了。他忍着剧痛，还是伸手把水闸门打开。
    烈火能毁钢和铁，熊焰难征革命心。凶猛的火焰，永远烧不坏我们忠于毛主席、忠于党的一颗红心。当时，火大得很，天然气声把人的耳朵震聋了，谁也听不见谁的声音，谁也看不清谁的面孔，时间不容许有任何犹豫，不容许开会商量。但是同志们一心想的是党的事业，齐心合力，拚命冲向井场，抢救国家财产。每个人都感到毛主席就在我们身边，毛泽东思想在指挥我们战斗。
    副指导员雷洪炳，带领三班全体同志，赶到井场。他不顾一切，顶着湿被子带头冲进火海，还没有靠拢，就被猛烈的火浪推到十几米远的山坡下，爬起来转身一看，头上顶的湿被子，不知被火冲到哪里去了。火烤得他难受，他清醒地想：“作为一个指挥员，越是在紧要关头，越要沉着机智。光凭个人勇敢不行，要依靠群众力量，弄清气源，切断气流，才能征服这场大火。”他根据毛主席的教导：“指挥员的正确的部署来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的和必要的侦察，和对于各种侦察材料的联贯起来的思索。”就在井场观察、判断，发现气流是从三号闸门和四号闸门之间放喷管线弯管处冲出来的，必须抢关三号闸门，才能截断气源。于是，他又带领同志，往三号闸门冲去。由于气流太猛，火力太大，他又一次被天然气冲昏倒在地上。同志们把他拉了出来。当他醒来时，又机智地想：不能接近三号闸门，就得另想一条对策，打开八号和五号闸门放喷，把天然气引出一部分到井场外边去，减弱火势，便于关住三号闸门。于是他第二次冲进火海，用撬杆插进闸门，手轮刚扳动两圈，就被硫化氢熏倒在地。后面的同志立即把他抢出火海。雷洪炳同志又一次苏醒过来，想到八号闸门还没有打开，想爬起来再去把它打开。但是，他感到头昏眼花，四肢无力。一次、二次、三次……，都爬不起来。这时，金光闪闪的毛主席语录从他眼前闪过：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的指示，给了他无穷的力量，他一下子就站了起来，偏偏倒倒地冲向八号闸门。几个同志拉住他，打手势，意思是说：“你不能再去了！我们去！”雷洪炳坚定地说：“时间不等人。要冲一起冲，要死一起死。死也要死在阵地上，死也要保住气井。”他和同志们在王有发、田华录的水龙带掩护下，一齐冲进火海，终于打开了八号闸门，引出一部分天然气，减弱了火势。
    我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人，不但最勇敢、最机智，而且最团结、最齐心。同志们在这场大火面前，临危不惧，英勇战斗，密切配合，互相掩护。在雷洪炳等抢开八号闸门时，彭家治带领胡德炳等同志，顶着被子在水龙的掩护下，冲进火海抢开五号闸门，由于火势太猛，他们冲了五次都被强大的气流推了出来。这时，队长周文华又拉了一块大木板，在水龙的掩护下，挡着大火，赢得了几秒钟时间。我又和同志们一拥而上，终于打开了五号闸门。随着八号和五号放喷闸门打开后，把部分天然气引出井场，场内烈火的威势有一些减弱。但是，如果不把三号闸门关住，井口仍旧有随时爆炸的危险……。
    这时，全体同志集中力量猛攻三号闸门。副司钻王有发本来在三号闸门附近，用水龙带掩护同志们抢关三号闸门。他看见有的同志被背了出来，马上把水龙带交给别的同志，冲了上去参加抢关三号闸门的战斗。他和胡德炳等十多名同志顶着湿被子，齐声呐喊：快！快！冲上去关住闸门。可是闸门已经烧变了形，冲上去的同志抓着烧红的手轮，大家一齐使劲，连换了两把大管钳，终于把三号闸门关住了。
    气源虽然被切断，井场火势减弱了，但是井口被烧变形了，大量的天然气仍从封井器盘根下四通等处刺漏的地方喷射出来，压力上升很快，井口爆炸的危险性越来越大。全队职工和赶来救火的钻前工程团的同志们，这时又不顾伤痛和劳累，一齐涌向井口，进行保护井口的最后战斗。副司钻王有发，抓起一床湿被子，盖上井口，不到一分钟，被子全被烧穿了。他转身又抓起第二床湿被子裹住全身，嘴里喊着：“你烧吧，你烧吧！”像黄继光堵敌人的机枪眼一样，冒着熊熊烈火，连人带被子，一下死死压在火口上，直到中毒昏迷过去，都没有松手。同志们把他救了出来。他苏醒后，睁眼一看，火还没有熄灭，又想挣扎起来。几个同志紧紧地按住他，他急得直喊：“快把我放了！把我放了！我是工人阶级，我是国家主人，只要我还有一口气，就要与烈火拚到底！我不能眼巴巴地看到国家财产受损失！”王有发甩开按他的几双手，又冲进燃烧的钻台下。大家也一齐冲向井口，先后用了三十多床湿被子，把井口死死压住，才把火焰压下去了。
    在这次战斗中，来队探亲家属、采集工衡思树的爱人牟茂修同志，表现了高度的共产主义大公无私精神。在灭火过程中，有人两次告诉她：“小牟，你爱人烧坏了！你去照顾爱人吧！”她一听，心里非常难过，但是她马上想到毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。”她想：“现在还是抢救国家财产要紧，救火要紧，爱人即使倒下了，但火还没有灭，我要坚持战斗下去。”她忍着内心的痛苦，擦干眼泪，继续坚持抢救伤员，抬重晶石粉，送湿被子，直到战斗结束。
    负责巡回检查管线的共产党员副司钻张永庆同志，在牺牲前两个小时还在学习毛主席著作。上班后他对当班的同志们说：“同志们，我们天天想抓‘气老虎’。现在‘气老虎’就要叫我们抓住了，我们要敢于斗争，敢于胜利。今晚是关井求压，压力上升很快，大家要加强检查，要对党对人民百分之百负责，把心拧在井口上，即使发生了问题，也要坚守岗位。”管线爆炸后，他直向四号闸门冲去，想把闸门打开放喷，把天然气引出井场，尽管爆炸破口的火焰射出五十多米远，他毫不犹豫，勇敢地冲向火海，与烈火展开了搏斗，终因火势太大，没冲到目的地，就英勇牺牲了。
      张永庆同志，生前就是一个活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样。他读毛主席的书最认真，执行毛主席的指示最坚决，改造自己最彻底。他说：“刀不磨不快，水不烧不开，人不学毛主席著作，就当不了革命派。”他一贯不怕苦，不怕死，艰苦朴素，关心同志。他常说：“毛主席教导我们要为全中国、全世界人民服务，我们打井四海为家，就是为了中国革命和世界革命。”他的身体很不好，有严重的胃病、喉炎，有时几种病同时发作，但仍不懈地坚持工作。痛得实在受不了，就用手顶着肚子，或者蹲一会再干。同志们无不为他这种坚强的毅力，顽强的革命精神所感动，说他是焦裕禄式的好工人。
      王平同志刚从兄弟队调来不久。他是个贫农的儿子，在旧社会被逼得家破人亡，骨肉分离，改名换姓，直到一九六四年，党和政府才帮他找到了亲生父母。他怀着对党的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，看到张永庆同志倒下去了，毫不犹豫的接着冲向四号闸门。他没走几步，就被火浪击倒，又挣扎起来抢关三号闸门，也英勇牺牲了。
    王平同志平时最爱读毛主席的书。他常说：人活一百岁，也是要死的，就看你怎样死法。我们要按照毛主席的教导去做，为人民的利益而死，才死得有意义，死得重于泰山。
    钻工罗华太、王祖明在火海之中，临危不惧，英勇顽强，为了保护国家财产，保护大气田，始终坚守岗位。他们牺牲后，仍保持着去抢关闸门和保护压力表的姿态，充分体现出忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于党，对革命高度负责的形象。
    司机助手、共青团员吴仲启勇敢地冲进火海，去按搭铁开关，以便开东挂泵，打水灭火，突然一股凶猛的火焰从他背后袭来，被烈火冲倒在地，壮烈地牺牲了。
    在这次救火护井的血战中，当场有五个同志壮烈牺牲，有二十二个同志光荣负伤。我们为失去亲密的战友感到万分悲痛。他们为了抢救国家财产，为党为人民献出了自己的生命。他们死得伟大，死得光荣，死得其所，死得比泰山还重。
    当汽车把受伤的同志送往医院抢救的时候，许多同志想到的还是救火护井，抢救阶级兄弟，没有想自己。王存友同志身负重伤，两只眼睛烧得看不见，他在被抬上汽车送往医院的路上，还不断地说：“我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事……。毛主席的石油战士，没有克服不了的困难，……坚持就是胜利！”护送伤员的同志看到他们伤得那样重，听了他们说的动人心肠的话，感动得流下了眼泪。
    伤员同志为党和人民的事业光荣负伤，伟大的党和伟大的领袖毛主席对我们无微不至的关怀，几个小时之内用飞机派来最好的医生，送来最好的药物和各种医疗器械，大力进行抢救。从中央到地方，许许多多有关部门，用最快的速度，支援抢救，不到一天时间，二十多个医疗单位，一百三十三名医护人员，全部赶到医院，在当地县委的领导下，组成了烧伤抢救中心小组，迅速开展了抢救工作。
    矿区职工、家属和当地人民群众，他们听到了同志们英勇护井，光荣负伤的消息以后，时刻关怀同志们的伤情。他们纷纷向党坚决表示：伤员要什么给什么，要皮献皮，伤员要多少血，我们就输多少血！有个贫农社员，步行八十里路，赶到医院输了三百毫升血。在整个抢救过程中，先后有九百余人为伤员输了血。
    党和人民对伤员们无微不至的关怀，给了同志们很大的鼓舞和力量。伤员们在病房中，仍然坚持活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作指导，同严重烧伤作斗争，充分表现了无产阶级的革命英雄主义精神。
    邓木全同志，烧伤面积达到百分之八十五，但是，他从来不叫一声痛。副指导员雷洪炳去看他，送去《毛主席语录》，他高兴得流下眼泪，用很小的声音说：“感谢党和毛主席的关怀，我真想他老人家，我最需要听他老人家的话。”护士替他接过《毛主席语录》，他对护士说：“今后多给我念念，我一定要按毛主席的教导办事，再大的困难也能挺住。”每当他被伤痛折磨得难以忍受的时候，他就请护士给他念一段《为人民服务》或《愚公移山》。
    由于邓木全同志负伤以后医生采取一切措施，抢救无效。在邓木全同志快要停止呼吸的时候，他还是念念不忘毛主席的教导，他用尽一切力量，发出细微的声音说：“按……毛主席……的……话……去……做……。”刚说完，就和大家永别了。邓木全同志，就是这样无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱党。在他的灵魂里，只有伟大的毛泽东思想，在他的脑子里，时时刻刻想着我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他不愧为毛主席的好战士，党和人民的优秀儿子。他将永远活在我们心里。
    石油工业部五好标兵冉树荣同志，他的烧伤面积有百分之五十二点七，大部分又是深度烧伤。严重的烧伤和病症的折磨，丝毫也没有动摇他坚强的革命意志。入院后刚刚苏醒，他就要求护士在他的床头放上毛主席像，给他读《为人民服务》等文章。有一次，学生们来看他，从窗外看到他忍受那么大的痛苦在换药，难过的哭出了声音。冉树荣同志问医生：“是谁在哭？”医生说：“是来看你的学生。”冉树荣说：“来来，不要哭！我们一齐来唱《大海航行靠舵手》。”同志们问他：“冉师傅，你烧得那么凶，为什么没有听你呻唤过？”他说：“麦贤得在战场上头部受了重伤，还坚持战斗，我就是要学习他的硬骨头精神，做毛主席的坚强战士。”他就是用这种精神，在床上整整趴了四十多天，连身都不能翻。在他神智昏迷时，也始终没有忘记毛主席和党中央。不断地说：“毛主席，我太想你老人家了！”他在昏迷中不断高喊“毛主席万岁”，“共产党万岁”。医生得到启发，就对他说：“老冉，我们是毛主席派来的医生。这是毛主席给你的药，快点吃！”他听了马上就大口地吃了。从此，他把吃一口水，吃一片药都当政治任务去完成。在他痛得难以忍受时，就高喊“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”并反复地背诵毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”说：“我冉树荣要争取胜利。”冉树荣同志在伤势十分严重的时候，仍然时刻想着伟大领袖毛主席。他就是这样对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。
    所有负伤的同志和冉树荣同志一样，在抢救国家财产时，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，在医院里也能战胜严重烧伤，充分表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人的硬骨头精神。
    来自四面八方的医疗队的同志们，带着党的委托和人民的期望，全力以赴，抢救阶级兄弟。他们说：“勇士们为抢救国家财产受了重伤，我们一定要把阶级兄弟的生命抢救过来。”在党和人民的大力抢救下，二十一个负伤的同志已经全部或基本恢复了健康。党和毛主席给了受伤同志们第二次生命，千句话，万句话，也说不尽我们的内心话，千兴奋，万兴奋，也表达不尽我们对党和毛主席无限热爱的心情。同志们表示，为革命事业粉身碎骨，也难以报答党和毛主席的恩情！我们全体同志一想到这些，就会感动得流泪。高呼：“毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！”
    在这次奋战火海保护气井的战斗中，为什么同志们在烈火面前，临危不惧，临危不乱，一条心，一股劲，前赴后继，以短短三十分钟时间扑灭了冲天大火？最根本的原因是毛泽东思想武装了我们的头脑。我们把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命的利益当成自己的第一生命。
    我们队里的同志，大多数出身于工农家庭，有许多人是解放军转业退伍的战士。我们对毛主席对党无限热爱，无限忠诚。几年来，全队同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作。有三分之一的同志写了近万字的日记。我们学习毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，学一点，用一点，学一句，用一句。每开展一次活动，进行一次工作，生产上碰到一个困难，解决一个人的思想问题，都要学一次毛主席著作；形成了上班学语录，床头挂语录，开会学语录，谈话念语录，工作对照语录的风气。同志们说：“从宿舍到井场，毛主席语录闪金光，走路见语录，大道明又亮，干活见语录，浑身是力量，处处见到毛主席语录，心中升起红太阳”。我们把毛主席的话“印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上”。遇到困难想起毛主席的话，劲头就来了，信心就足了，干劲就大，什么困难也不在话下。这一胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    我们在抢救气井中做出了一点成绩，伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的党对我们无限关怀，给予我们最高的荣誉。成绩应该归功于伟大的领袖毛主席，归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，归功于伟大的党。今后我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，认真地贯彻执行林彪同志最近的指示，要掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，尽最大的努力，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。我们一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，永远以解放军为榜样，学习大庆人的革命精神，永远戒骄戒躁，把自己锻炼成为一支更勇敢，更坚强，更齐心，更无私的石油工人队伍，把我们这个队建设成为毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，以十六条为武器，抓革命促生产，多打井，快打井，打好井，拿出更多的油和气来，淹死美帝，气死老修，以实际行动，回答毛主席和党中央的关怀，回答全国人民对我们的关怀。（附图片）
