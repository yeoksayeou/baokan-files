New York, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Nasi spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on September 29, sternly denouncing U.S. imperialism's aggression and war policies. He exposed the U.S. and its accomplices' schemes in the Vietnam issue, playing with "peace talks." He expressed firm support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations.

Nasi pointed out that the heroic Vietnamese people have dealt heavy blows to the U.S. aggressors, causing them severe defeats. It is under these circumstances that the U.S. colludes with its accomplices to play the "peace talks" trick, "attempting to obtain what they are losing on the battlefield." He pointed out that among the U.S.'s accomplices, there are also some "pseudo-socialist governments," which "shout loudly, trying to make people believe they support the Vietnamese people; but in reality, they are serving U.S. imperialism."

Nasi emphasized that when exposing attempts to use the United Nations to serve U.S. policies in Vietnam, the United Nations organization has no right to interfere in Vietnamese affairs; any attempt to let the United Nations meddle in the Vietnam issue will inevitably fail.

Nasi reiterated that the Albanian people and government firmly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle, support the Vietnamese people's just demands to stop U.S. aggression and unconditionally withdraw all U.S. troops from Vietnam immediately, believing that "this is the only way to solve the Vietnam issue."

Nasi also revealed that due to "a European major power's leadership clique" taking a conciliatory and cooperative stance toward the U.S., this "most aggressive imperialist country," the U.S. has shifted its global strategy eastward and is plotting to "establish an anti-China 'holy alliance.'"

The Albanian foreign minister also exposed and condemned the collusion between the two major powers within the United Nations on issues such as disarmament. He said, "The current negotiations between the two superpowers on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons aim to concentrate the monopoly of such weapons in their hands to dominate the world." He stressed that "'non-proliferation of nuclear weapons' is a trap set for the sovereignty of independent countries, seriously harming these countries' highest right of self-defense and openly violating the interests of international peace and security. We believe that all peace-loving countries should jointly strive to stop nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, and not let the fate of international peace and security fall into the hands of the two superpowers." He reiterated that the Albanian government fully supports the Chinese government's proposal for a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

Nasi also strongly condemned and firmly opposed the two major powers' plot to establish so-called "United Nations forces." He pointed out that plotting to establish such an "international police force" is "aimed at suppressing the national liberation movements and revolutionary movements of various countries"; at the same time, it is also directed against various peace-loving countries.

Nasi strongly demanded the restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful seat in the United Nations. He solemnly pointed out: "There is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Only the government of this country and its representatives can represent this country in international relations, in the United Nations organization, and in all other international organizations." To deprive the People's Republic of China of its lawful rights and illegally stuff the Chiang Kai-shek traitor clique, which has been spat upon by the Chinese people, into the United Nations is "a blatant violation of the (United Nations) Charter" and is a "clear example" of the U.S. manipulating the United Nations and being hostile to the Chinese people.

The Albanian foreign minister emphasized: "The People's Republic of China is a peace-loving socialist great power, playing a very important role in safeguarding Asian and world peace. It firmly supports the struggle of the people of various countries for freedom and social progress, and it is respected by the entire progressive humanity. 'Without the participation of this socialist great power, the People's Republic of China, with its 700 million people, it is impossible to solve any important international issue of the contemporary world.' He demanded the immediate restoration of the People's Republic of China's lawful rights in the United Nations.

    阿尔巴尼亚外长在联大谴责两个大国相互勾结阴谋主宰世界
    联合国根本无权过问越南问题
    没有七亿人口的中国参加就不能解决任何重要国际问题
    据新华社六日讯　纽约消息：阿尔巴尼亚外交部长纳赛九月二十九日在联合国大会发言，严正谴责美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，揭露美国及其同谋者在越南问题上玩弄“和平谈判”阴谋。他表示坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，并坚决要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
    纳赛指出，英雄的越南人民给了美国侵略者以沉重的打击，使它遭到了惨重失败。正是在这种情况下，美国勾结它的同谋者玩弄“和平谈判”的阴谋，“企图这样来得到他们正在战场上失去的东西”。他指出，在美国的同谋者当中，也有一些“假社会主义政府”，“这些政府大叫大嚷，企图使人相信它们是支持越南人民的；但是实际上，它们是为美帝国主义者效劳的。”
    纳赛在揭露有人企图利用联合国为美国的侵越政策效劳时强调指出，联合国组织根本无权过问越南事务；任何让联合国插手越南问题的企图必然要遭到失败。
    纳赛重申，阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争，支持越南人民提出的关于停止美国侵略、无条件地立即从越南撤出一切美国军队的正义要求，认为“这是解决越南问题的唯一途径”。
    纳赛还揭露说，由于“一个欧洲大国的领导集团”对美国这个“最富于侵略性的帝国主义国家采取妥协和合作的立场”，美国已经把它的全球战略重点东移，并且正在策划“建立一个反华的‘神圣同盟’”。
    阿尔巴尼亚外长也揭露和谴责了两个大国在联合国内就裁军等问题进行的勾结。他说，“目前两大国之间正在进行的关于不扩散核武器的谈判，目的是要把这种武器的垄断权集中在它们的手里，以便主宰世界。”他强调指出：“‘不扩散核武器’是为各独立国家的主权设下的圈套，它严重地损害着这些国家的最高自卫权，并且公开违反国际和平与安全的利益。我们认为，所有爱好和平的国家都应该共同努力，制止核讹诈和核威胁，不让国际和平和安全的命运落在两个大国的手里。”他重申，阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持中国政府提出的关于全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的主张。
    纳赛还强烈谴责和坚决反对两个大国策划建立所谓“联合国部队”的阴谋。他指出，策划建立这样一支“国际宪兵”部队，“是为了镇压各国人民的民族解放运动和革命运动”；同时，它的矛头也是指向各个爱好和平的国家的。
    纳赛强烈要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位。他严正指出：“世界上只有一个中国，这就是中华人民共和国。只有这个国家的政府及其代表，能够在国际关系中、在联合国组织及其他一切国际组织中代表这个国家。”剥夺中华人民共和国的合法权利，而把早已为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团非法塞在联合国，“这是对（联合国）宪章的明目张胆的破坏”，也是美国操纵联合国和敌视中国人民的一个“明显的例证”。
    阿尔巴尼亚外长强调指出：“中华人民共和国是热爱和平的社会主义大国，它对保卫亚洲和世界和平起着十分重要的作用。它坚决支持各国人民争取自由和社会进步的斗争，它受到整个进步人类的尊敬。”“没有这个拥有七亿人口的社会主义大国中华人民共和国的参加，就不能解决当代任何重要的国际问题。”他要求立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。
