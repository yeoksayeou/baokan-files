We heard the news that our great leader Chairman Mao, on the night of National Day, sat on the ground at the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen, watching the fireworks with the masses. We were overjoyed and deeply moved. Everyone rushed to tell each other the good news.

At six o'clock in the evening, we all came to Tiananmen Square without any prior arrangement, looking at the photograph in the *People's Daily* to find the place where Chairman Mao sat. At this moment, a soldier pointed out, "This is where Chairman Mao sat." Everyone immediately sat down around the place where he had sat. A Red Guard said, "I can sit in the place where Chairman Mao sat, which is a great honor!" Another Red Guard said, "Sitting here, it feels as if Chairman Mao is sitting beside us! We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution." Everyone spoke one after another, but no words could express our sincere love for Chairman Mao. People sang revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea," cheering: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

We frequently faced Tiananmen, holding the red treasure book—*Quotations from Chairman Mao*—and read aloud, listening to Chairman Mao's affectionate instructions. Our hands were red from clapping, and our throats were hoarse from shouting, but it was still difficult to express our boundless joy and happiness. Facing Chairman Mao's portrait, we gazed at his kind face, with tears of happiness in our eyes. How much we wanted to see our most beloved Chairman Mao!

The night was very deep, but the people gathered at the Golden Water Bridge were becoming more and more numerous. To express our boundless love for the great leader, we, revolutionaries from all over the country, stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and held a solemn oath:

We will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

We will definitely carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end according to the policies and lines formulated by Chairman Mao!

We will definitely plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over China and all over the world!

    在毛主席坐过的地方
    我们听到伟大领袖毛主席，在国庆之夜，在天安门前金水桥上席地而坐，同群众一起观看节日焰火的消息，万分高兴，万分激动。大家奔走相告，互传佳音。
    晚上六点钟，我们不约而同地来到天安门前，对着《人民日报》上的照片，寻找毛主席坐过的地方。这时，一位解放军同志指点说：“这就是毛主席坐过的地方。”大家立刻围着他老人家坐过的地方坐下了。一个红卫兵说：“我能在毛主席坐过的地方坐一坐，也是莫大幸福！”另一个红卫兵说：“我们坐在这里，就好像毛主席也坐在我们身旁一样！我们要永远跟着毛主席干革命。”大家你一言我一语，千言万语也说不尽对毛主席无限热爱的真挚感情。人们高唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，欢呼：中国共产党万岁！伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    我们不时地面向天安门，捧着红色的宝书——《毛主席语录》高声朗读，倾听着毛主席的亲切教导。手拍红了，嗓子喊哑了，可是还难以表达我们这种无限喜悦、无限幸福的激动心情。我们面对着毛主席的像，凝视着他老人家那慈祥的面孔，眼睛里含着幸福的泪花，我们是多么想见到我们最敬爱的毛主席啊！
    夜已很深了，但是聚集在金水桥的人却越来越多。为了表达我们对伟大领袖无限热爱的心情，我们这些来自五湖四海的革命同志，站在毛主席像前，举行庄严的宣誓：
    我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！
    我们一定要按照毛主席制定的方针路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    我们一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全中国，插遍全世界！
