The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is cleansing West Lake in Hangzhou of all the filth and mud left over from history. Now, every scenic spot, every stall, ticket booth, park, and teahouse is adorned with portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and gleaming gold-colored quotations from Chairman Mao. The old stone tablets, defiling the scenery of West Lake for centuries, written by the feudal emperor Qianlong, have all been smashed by the revolutionary masses. The filthy ink traces left by reactionary bureaucrats and feudal literati from the old society have been washed away clean. In the main hall of the Yue Temple, there are posters and illustrations introducing the heroic deeds of heroes like Lei Feng and Wang Jie.

The Xiling Seal Society on West Lake's Xiling Hill has, for over sixty years, been a gathering place for reactionary bureaucrats, warlords, landlords, and bourgeois so-called literati and gentlemen to spread reactionary thoughts. Now, the Red Guards have cleared out all the outdated junk. The storefront is brand new, adorned and displayed with portraits of Chairman Mao, manuscripts of Chairman Mao's poems, and pictures of seals carved with Chairman Mao's poems.

At the newly refurbished Yuquan, a large wall of marble is embedded with the golden, shining manuscript of Chairman Mao's "Snow: Plum Blossom in the Cold." In many of the teahouses in the West Lake scenic area, there are Chairman Mao's works and newspapers, where people can rest, read newspapers, and study Chairman Mao's works.

Today's West Lake is not only a scenic spot for the laboring people to visit but has also become a large school for people to study Mao Zedong Thought. It is red everywhere, full of revolutionary vigor.

    西湖换了新装
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，荡涤着杭州西湖从历史上遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。现在，所有风景点、售货亭、售票处、公园、茶室等处，都张挂着我们伟大领袖毛主席的像，贴着金光闪闪的毛主席语录。曾经玷污了西湖风景几百年的出自封建皇帝乾隆手笔的旧碑牌，一个个被革命群众砸碎了。旧社会遗留下来的反动官僚、封建文人的污秽墨迹，也被冲刷得干干净净。在岳庙的大殿里，张贴着介绍英雄人物雷锋、王杰等光辉事迹的照片和挂图。
    西湖孤山的西泠印社，六十多年来一直是反动官僚、军阀、地主和资产阶级所谓文人雅士集会结社、宣扬反动思想的地方。如今，红卫兵把陈腐不堪的东西统统搬掉了。门市部里焕然一新，张挂和陈列着毛主席像、毛主席诗词手稿等等；还有篆刻毛主席诗词的图片。
    在修饰一新的玉泉，大幅的大理石墙上嵌着金光闪闪的毛主席写的《沁园春·雪》手稿。西湖风景区的许多茶室里，放着毛主席著作和书报，人们可以在茶室里休息、看报和学习毛主席著作。
    今日西湖，不仅是劳动人民游览的胜地，而且成了人们学习毛泽东思想的一个大学校，处处是一片红色，充满着革命的生气。
