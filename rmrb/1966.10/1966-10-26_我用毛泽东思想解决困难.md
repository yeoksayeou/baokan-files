Title: I Use Mao Zedong Thought to Solve Difficulties

I am reading every word of Chairman Mao's works with great interest.

I am twenty-nine years old, have worked as a fitter, and am now a university student. During the summer vacation, I worked on construction sites and in forest areas. This is not for the money, but because I have come to realize the importance of combining work with study. Unfortunately, there are still not many people in West Germany who understand this. But wasn't the Chinese Red Army also very small at the beginning?

Now, I gradually see the laws of Mao Zedong Thought in life. I also begin to use Mao Zedong Thought to solve the difficulties I encounter. Using this new method to deal with difficulties is very powerful and effective.

Revolution, under the sole correct guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, will burn all the imperialist gentlemen. We know that in the mainstream of marching towards revolutionary victory, there are also whirlpools and reefs. For example, the likes of Deng Tuo and Wu Han. But Chairman Mao's words are the rudder.

I fully agree with your policies towards imperialism, reactionaries in various countries, and modern revisionists.

    我用毛泽东思想解决困难
    我正以极大的兴趣阅读毛主席著作的每一句话。
    我今年二十九岁，当过钳工，现在在大学念书。暑假时到工地、森林区当工人。这并不是为了挣钱，而是我认识到半工半读的重要性。可惜目前在西德持有这种认识的人还不多。但是，中国红军刚开始时，不也是很弱小的吗？
    现在，我逐渐开始在生活中看到了毛泽东思想的规律。我也开始用毛泽东思想来解决遇到的困难。用这种新的方式来对付困难，是非常有力而奏效的。
    革命在唯一正确的毛泽东思想指导下，将烧掉所有的帝国主义先生们。我们知道，在走向革命胜利的主流中，也隐藏着漩涡和暗礁。例如邓拓、吴晗之流。但毛主席的话就是船舵。
    我完全赞成你们对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义者的政策。
      〔西德〕伯哈特
