The Chinese people will create more miracles

In the early hours of the 28th, after hearing the good news of our country's successful test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear warhead, we were genuinely overjoyed. Immediately, the workshop was filled with big-character posters celebrating and congratulating the achievement. Everyone unanimously said: This is a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a resounding slap in the face of imperialism and modern revisionism.

Imperialism and modern revisionism do not believe that the Chinese people can quickly produce missiles and nuclear warheads. However, the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to tread paths where none have gone before and scale heights that none have reached. Whatever imperialism can make, we can make; what they don't have, we will have. This is true now and will be even more so in the future.

Imperialism and modern revisionism cannot fathom where the strength of the Chinese people comes from. They worship science and technology, and their minds are filled with nothing but mechanization. In contrast, the Chinese people have two kinds of "ization" in their minds: one is revolutionization, and the other is mechanization. We prioritize revolutionization, study Mao Zedong Thought extensively, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seize the revolution, and promote production, achieving brilliant results in all areas. Imperialism and modern revisionism have atomic bombs. Not only do we have atomic bombs, but we also have the spiritual atomic bomb of Mao Zedong Thought. The power of the spiritual atomic bomb is a million times stronger than that of the atomic bomb. The reason why the Chinese people always surprise imperialism and modern revisionism, making them stare in disbelief, lies here.

Today, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our country successfully conducted a test launch of a missile carrying a nuclear warhead. Tomorrow, we will rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to create even more new miracles in the three great revolutionary struggles. We will most resolutely and enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, studying them thousands and tens of thousands of times, and using them at every moment, so that the roots of Mao Zedong Thought are deeply planted in our minds. On the foundation of ideological revolutionization, we will complete our production tasks on our respective positions even more excellently, building our socialist motherland into an even more solid and powerful world revolutionary base.

### 中国人民要创造更多的奇迹

    中国人民要创造更多的奇迹
    二十八日凌晨，我们听到了我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的好消息以后，真是打心眼里感到痛快。顿时车间里贴了许多报喜、祝贺的大字报。大家异口同声地说：这是毛泽东思想的新胜利，这是给帝国主义和现代修正主义的一记响亮的耳光。
    帝国主义和现代修正主义不相信中国人民很快就能生产导弹和核弹头。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，要走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀过的高峰。帝国主义能制造的，我们要制造；他们没有的，我们也要有。现在是这样，将来更是这样。
    帝国主义和现代修正主义的死脑瓜，无法理解中国人民的力量是从哪里来的。他们迷信科学技术，他们的脑子里只有一个机械化；而中国人民头脑里却有两个化：一个是革命化，一个是机械化。我们把革命化放在首要地位，大学毛泽东思想，大搞无产阶级文化大革命，抓革命，促生产，在各方面取得了辉煌的战果。帝国主义和现代修正主义有原子弹。我们不但有原子弹，还有毛泽东思想的精神原子弹。精神原子弹的威力，要比原子弹强大千万倍。中国人民所做的事，总是要使帝国主义和现代修正主义吃惊，把他们吓得目瞪口呆，根本原因就在这里。
    今天，我国在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，成功地进行了发射导弹核武器试验。明天，我们还要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在三大革命斗争中，创造出更多更新的奇迹来。我们最坚决、最热烈地响应林彪同志的号召，要进一步学好用好毛主席著作，千遍万遍地学，时时刻刻地用，使毛泽东思想的根子在我们的脑子里扎的深深的。我们要在思想革命化的基础上，把本岗位的生产任务完成得更出色，把社会主义的祖国建设成为更加巩固、更加强大的世界革命根据地。
