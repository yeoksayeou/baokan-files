According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Khamkeut on the 24th, the Pathet Lao radio broadcast that on the 19th, the Central Committee of the Lao People's Patriotic Front Party issued a statement exposing and condemning Phoumi's speech on the 18th at the United Nations General Assembly, which served the U.S. aggression policy. The statement pointed out that Phoumi's speech was merely another clumsy product manufactured under the instructions of the Johnson administration, aimed at deceiving public opinion and covering up the crimes and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to have the United Nations intervene in Laos.

The statement revealed that on the Vietnam issue, Phoumi followed the U.S., shamelessly playing the worn-out "peace talks" trick of the Johnson administration.

Regarding the situation in Laos, Phoumi's speech once again brutally distorted the just struggle of the Lao people against U.S. imperialism. He repeated the shameful and deceitful arguments that have long been condemned and refuted by public opinion, slandering the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, shouting about "North Vietnam invading South Vietnam through Laos," "North Vietnamese troops in Laos," and so on.

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism is currently intensifying its aggression, preparing to send U.S. ground troops and mercenary forces to attack the central and southern regions of Laos, turning this region into a strategic bridgehead connecting South Vietnam and Thailand, in an attempt to save its predicament in South Vietnam and Indochina. In this context, Phoumi's speech at the United Nations General Assembly is obviously an attempt to prepare public opinion for the above-mentioned military adventurism of U.S. imperialism.

The statement pointed out that the Vientiane puppet government is a puppet of the United States. This puppet government has no right to represent the Lao people. Therefore, Phoumi or any other person from the Vientiane puppet government has no right to speak or act on behalf of the Lao people at the United Nations or anywhere else.

The statement said that the United Nations has no right to discuss the Lao issue.

The statement said that the Lao People's Patriotic Front firmly protests against Phoumi's lies at the United Nations, opposes all conspiracies to illegally interfere in Laos through the United Nations, and clearly reiterates: The United States must immediately stop its aggression against Laos; it must withdraw all U.S. military personnel and the military personnel of its puppet countries from Laos; the United States must allow the Lao people to resolve their internal affairs themselves.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on the 21st, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 20th refuting the slander against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam by Prince Souphanouvong of Laos at the United Nations General Assembly on October 18th.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are the culprits behind the current tense situation in Laos.

U.S. imperialism has been attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam through Lao airspace. However, U.S. imperialism and its followers have been constantly spreading rumors and slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, attempting to cover up their crimes.

The statement said that Prince Souphanouvong echoed the cunning arguments of U.S. imperialism. Such actions are completely contrary to the interests of the Lao people and can only benefit the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    老挝爱国战线党发言人谴责富马在联大掩盖美帝侵略罪行
    联合国完全无权讨论老挝问题
    越外交部发表声明驳斥富马对越南民主共和国的诬蔑
    据新华社康开二十四日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十九日发表声明，揭露和谴责富马十八日在联合国大会上为美国侵略政策效劳的讲话。声明指出，富马的讲话只不过是在约翰逊政府的指使下炮制出来的又一个拙劣的产物，其目的在于欺骗舆论、掩盖美帝国主义的侵略罪行和阴谋让联合国来干预老挝。
    声明揭露，在越南问题上，富马追随美国，大肆玩弄约翰逊政府早已玩弄得陈旧了的“和平谈判”的骗人把戏。
    关于老挝局势，富马的讲话再一次粗暴地歪曲老挝人民抗击美帝国主义的正义战斗，重弹长久以来就遭到舆论谴责和驳斥的可耻的欺骗论调，诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和诬蔑越南民主共和国，叫嚷什么“北越通过老挝侵入越南南方”、“在老挝有北越军队”等等。
    声明指出，美帝国主义目前正在加紧扩大侵略战争，准备派遣美国陆军和帮凶军攻打中、下寮地区，把这个地区变成连接越南南方和泰国之间的战略桥头堡，妄图挽救它在越南南方和印度支那的窘境。在这种情况下，富马在联合国大会的讲话，显然是妄图为美帝国主义的上述军事冒险阴谋作舆论准备。
    声明指出，万象伪政权是美国的傀儡。这一伪政权完全没有资格代表老挝人民。因此，富马或万象伪政权的其他任何人都完全没有资格代表老挝人民在联合国或者其他任何地方发表讲话或者采取行动。
    声明说，联合国完全无权讨论老挝问题。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党坚决抗议富马在联合国的谰言，反对妄图利用联合国非法干涉老挝的一切阴谋，并且明确地重申：美国必须立即停止对老挝的侵略战争；必须把美国军事人员及其仆从国军队和军事人员全部撤出老挝；美国必须让老挝人民自己解决老挝的内部事务。
    据新华社河内二十一日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人二十日发表声明，驳斥老挝梭发那·富马亲王十月十八日利用联合国大会讲坛对越南民主共和国进行的诬蔑。
    声明指出，美帝国主义侵略者是制造老挝目前紧张局势的罪魁。
    美帝国主义通过老挝领空袭击越南民主共和国。然而，美帝国主义及其追随者却不断地造谣和诬蔑越南民主共和国，妄图掩盖它们的罪行。
    声明说，梭发那·富马亲王附和美帝国主义，重弹它的狡诈论调。这种作法完全同老挝人民的利益背道而驰，这只能对美帝国主义侵略者有利。
