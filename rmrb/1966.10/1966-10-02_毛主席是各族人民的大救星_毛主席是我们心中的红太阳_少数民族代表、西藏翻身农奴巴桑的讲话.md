	Chairman Mao, our most beloved leader of the revolutionary people of all nationalities: Comrades, students, and friends:

	We, the delegation of ethnic minorities, have come from all parts of our motherland, from the distant frontiers, to the capital of our beloved country—Beijing, to be by the side of our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, to celebrate the great festival of all nationalities. Each one of us feels immense honor and boundless happiness! We bring with us the boundless admiration and love of tens of millions of ethnic minority people for Chairman Mao! On behalf of the people of all nationalities, I wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

	The laboring people of more than fifty ethnic minorities in our country all have their own history of suffering. Before liberation, they suffered cruel oppression, exploitation, and enslavement at the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang, feudal lords, and slave owners. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we have been completely liberated. Former slaves and serfs have now become masters of the state. Chairman Mao! You are the great savior of the laboring people of all nationalities! You are the red sun in our hearts!

	We will resolutely follow the wise leadership of our great leader, Chairman Mao, and resolutely respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao: read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will study for a lifetime, use for a lifetime, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for a lifetime, passing down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation.

	In the ethnic minority regions, just like in all parts of the country, the great proletarian cultural revolution is being carried out vigorously. This great revolutionary movement is excellent! We must pay more attention to national affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end! We must also pay attention to international affairs. We firmly oppose American imperialism, firmly oppose modern revisionism, and firmly oppose the reactionaries of all countries! We firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end! We firmly support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries in the world!

	The people of all nationalities must closely unite around Chairman Mao, learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Dazhai, learn from Daqing, seize the revolution, promote production, strive for self-improvement, be self-reliant, strengthen national unity, consolidate national unity, defend the frontiers of the motherland, and strive for the construction of a prosperous and powerful socialist motherland!

	Long live the great People's Republic of China!

	Long live the great unity of the people of all nationalities!

	Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!
