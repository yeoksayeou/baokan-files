He enthusiastically praised: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest, most profound, and most thorough revolution."

Hane Eiiichi said, "This is our first visit to China. We have seen a new China full of revolutionary vigor under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "During this visit to China, we not only witnessed the great scene of China's National Day, but also had the opportunity to see Chairman Mao twice, which is a great honor and happiness for a lifetime."

Hane Eiiichi said: "Today, the Chinese people, in order to ensure the socialist cause for generations to come, are carrying out an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through this visit, we have clearly understood that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest, most profound, and most thorough revolution. Through this revolution, China can avoid the rule of modern revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism." He said, the highly conscious Chinese people, in order to never again let imperialism and reactionaries ride roughshod over them, and to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, build and develop the cause of the socialist revolution, have launched, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, this magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He expressed his absolute belief that through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the whole country will present a new and all-round leaping-forward situation.

    日本社会党活动家羽根荣一说
    中国人民在进行一场最伟大的革命
    据新华社讯　第四批日本社会党活动家代表团团长羽根荣一，回国途中路经香港时，对报纸记者发表谈话。他热烈赞扬：“中国文化大革命是一场最伟大、最深刻、最彻底的革命。”
    羽根荣一说，他们都是第一次到中国访问。他们看到在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的新中国，充满了热气腾腾的革命景象。他说：“我们这次访问中国，不但看见了中国国庆的伟大情景，而且有机会两次看到毛主席，真是一生一世难得有的光荣和幸福。”
    羽根荣一说：“今天，中国人民为确保社会主义江山，世世代代永不变色，正在进行着史无前例的文化大革命。通过这次访问，使我们清楚了解，中国文化大革命是一场最伟大、最深刻、最彻底的革命。经过这场大革命，中国就可以避免出现现代修正主义的统治，就可以防止资本主义的复辟。”他说，有着高度觉悟的中国人民，为了永不让帝国主义和反动派重新再骑在头上，为着进一步巩固无产阶级专政，建设和发展社会主义革命事业，在毛主席亲自发动和领导下，掀起了这场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命。他表示绝对相信，中国通过这场文化大革命，全国将出现一个崭新的全面跃进的局面。
