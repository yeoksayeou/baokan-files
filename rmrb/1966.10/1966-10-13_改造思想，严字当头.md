After breakfast, the supply officer went into the city to pick up Wang Weiyi's father, who was a logistical support member. However, he returned alone after lunch. It turned out that he had searched the entire morning without finding him. I heard this and felt anxious, thinking: The elderly man traveled thousands of miles to see his son, and if he can't find the camp, how worried he must be! Wang Weiyi is on a business trip and not at home, so I should proactively bring the elderly man back. With this in mind, I prepared to go and pick him up again. But then I thought: The supply officer searched the entire morning without finding him, how could I find him in just two hours? This way, I wouldn't be able to take my afternoon nap. So, the concepts of "public" and "private" clashed in my mind. At this moment, I immediately realized that I must strictly demand of myself, otherwise, the "private" would prevail. Thus, I used Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely selfless and dedicated to the people" to guide myself, rode the platoon leader's bicycle, and braved the scorching sun to go into the city. In the city, I searched from the department store to the supermarket, from the bookstore to the restaurant, and finally found Wang Weiyi's father just before the afternoon drill.

This incident made me deeply realize: thought reform must start with "strictness." If one cannot strictly demand of oneself and only uses general standards, thinking that "getting by" is enough, then in reality, one is relaxing thought reform. Only with "strictness" first can one overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, achieving "complete" and "thorough" service to the people.

    改造思想，严字当头
    通信员　苗凤池
    吃过早饭，司务长进城去接给养员王维义的父亲。可是午饭后，他却一个人回来了。原来他找了整整一上午没有找见。我听了很着急，心想：老人家千里迢迢来看儿子，找不到营房该多着急呀！王维义出差不在家，我应该主动把老人家接回来。想到这里，我就准备再去接一趟。可是又一想：司务长整整一上午都没有找到，我两个小时怎么能找到呢？这一去午睡就睡不成了。就这样，“公”字和“私”字在脑子里打开了架。这时我立刻意识到，一定要严格要求自己，不然“私”字就要占上风了。于是我就用毛主席“毫不利己专门利人”的教导要求自己，骑上连长的自行车，顶着火热的太阳进城去了。在城里，我从百货大楼找到百货商场，从书店找到饭店，终于在下午操课前找到了王维义的父亲。
    这件事使我深刻地认识到：思想改造，必须“严”字当头。如果不能严格要求自己，只用一般标准要求自己，认为“过得去”就行，那实际是放松思想改造。只有“严”字当头，才能破私立公，做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务。
