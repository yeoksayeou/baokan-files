At 1 AM on June 22, the heroic drilling team 32111 fought a bloody battle against the raging fire. In the midst of the blazing inferno, the young hero Wang Zuming, in the style of Qiu Shaoyun, stood tall like a mountain pine by the gate, his hands firmly gripping the wheel, steadfastly guarding his post until his last breath.

Wang Zuming, a 19-year-old son of a poor peasant, lived under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In school, Wang Zuming loved to hear stories about heroes like Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, and Luo Shengtao. He secretly vowed, "I will learn from heroes like Huang Jiguang and Luo Shengtao, listen to Chairman Mao's words, be a good child of Chairman Mao, and strive to become a hero myself."

One cold morning, on his way to school, Wang Zuming saw two classmates fall into the water while crossing a log bridge. He jumped into the icy water and saved them both.

Early last year, Wang Zuming began systematically studying Chairman Mao's works. He had a "red book bag" containing Chairman Mao's works and Lei Feng's diary. He carried this bag wherever he went, studying wherever he was. After studying articles like "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," his ideological awareness was raised, and he realized that serving the people is very concrete. He said, "Every piece of work I do, every small thing beneficial to the people, is a concrete way of serving the people, following Chairman Mao's instructions." Therefore, he always did good deeds for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Once, on the road, he encountered an old woman in her fifties struggling with a 30-plus kilogram sheep. He went up to her and said, "Grandma, let me take you home." He then carried the sheep and walked for over seven miles, delivering the old woman to her doorstep. He was very caring towards the childless and elderly members of the production team, such as the 50-plus-year-old Zhao Qiming and the 60-plus-year-old He Mama, often helping them fetch water and deliver their grain. Last June, when He Mama's house was destroyed by a storm, he used his free time after work to help her repair it. He Mama was moved and said, "You are so caring, like a son to me." Wang Zuming replied, "I am your son, I am the son of all poor and lower-middle peasants and laboring people, and I will dedicate my life to serving the laboring people."

Last October, after Wang Zuming joined the petroleum industry, he often took Lei Feng and Wang Jie as examples, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people as his guiding principle.

One night at midnight, he found that a grease nipple had fallen off the mud shaker. He searched every corner but couldn't find it. He decided not to go off duty until he found it. Later, he noticed a small ditch nearby and started searching along it. His fellow workers had already gone off duty, but Wang Zuming searched alone for over an hour before finally finding the grease nipple in the ditch. Everyone was concerned and asked him, "Why didn't you say anything so we could help you find it?" He replied, "Chairman Mao teaches us that every word and action must be accountable to the people. I found the grease nipple, which is being responsible for the revolutionary cause."

Once, he made a mistake in recording a few data points. The incoming recorder said, "Go to sleep, I'll correct it for you." He replied, "Our work must be accountable to the people. You can correct the data on the table, but my careless thinking won't change. Let me correct it myself!"

During a discussion on Chairman Mao's instructions on finding gas and oil, Wang Zuming said excitedly, "We must resolutely complete the task given to us by Chairman Mao. For the sake of finding gas and oil, I am willing to die on the battlefield, to boost the morale of the Chinese people."

The mud settling pond often leaked mud. He would always be the first to jump into the pond to plug the leak. One night, it was raining and very cold, and the mud pond leaked again. Despite the cold and the strong alkalinity of the mud that burned his skin, he took off his clothes and jumped into the mud pond. The team leader shouted at him, "Come out quickly, don't catch a cold, the mud will burn your skin." His comrades tried to pull him out, but he said, "Burning my skin is a small matter, leaking mud affects the drilling, I must plug it." He persisted until the leak was plugged before coming out.

Once, during a well blowout, the mud soaked his clothes. He simply took off his clothes and continued operating in just his shorts. The blowout became more intense, and it was necessary to quickly control it; otherwise, if it caught fire, it would cause irreparable damage to the country. At this critical moment, he hugged the back-pressure valve and rushed forward. The blowing mud pushed him back, but he rushed forward again and was pushed back again. In this dangerous and tense moment, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He rushed forward again, installed the back-pressure valve, and safely controlled the blowout.

During the bloody battle against the fire, Wang Zuming died heroically guarding the second gate. When he took over, he had promised the team leader, "Please rest assured, Party. Even if the sky falls, I will hold it up. To make a revolution, one must not be afraid of death; fearing death means no revolution." He turned Chairman Mao's instructions into highly conscious actions. His image of loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will forever live in the hearts of the people across the country!

### 邱少云式的青年英雄王祖明

    邱少云式的青年英雄王祖明
    六月二十二日清晨一时，32111英雄钻井队在血战火海的搏斗中，邱少云式的青年英雄王祖明，在冲天的熊熊大火之中，像高山青松一样，挺立在闸门旁边，双手紧握手轮，坚守岗位，直到最后停止呼吸。
    十九岁的贫农的儿子王祖明，是在毛泽东思想指导下生活的。
    在学校里，王祖明最爱听董存瑞、黄继光、邱少云、罗盛教等英雄的故事。他暗暗地下定决心：“我要向黄继光、罗盛教等英雄学习，好好听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子，将来也要争取做一个英雄。”
    一个严寒的早晨，王祖明在上学的路上，看到两个同学过独木桥时失足落水。他就跳下刺骨的冷水，把两个同学救了上来。
    去年初，王祖明开始系统地学习毛主席著作。他有一个“红色书包”，里面装着毛主席著作和雷锋日记。他走到那里，就把这个挂包带到那里，学到那里。他学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章后，提高了思想觉悟，认识到为人民服务是非常具体的。他说：“我做每项工作，为人民每做一件有益的小事，都是具体的为人民服务，都是按毛主席指示办事。”因此，他处处为贫下中农做好事。一次，他在路上碰到一位五十多岁的老妈妈，牵着一只三十多斤重的羊，牵不走，也抱不动。他走过去说：“老妈妈，我送你回家。”说着就抱起羊一直送了七里多路，把老妈妈送到了家门口。他对生产队里无儿无女的五保户赵启明老大爷，和没有劳动力的六十多岁的何妈妈，非常关心，经常帮他们担水，把他们分的粮食送到家里。去年六月，何妈妈的房子被暴风雨冲塌了，他就利用每天劳动后的空隙时间，帮助何妈妈修好了房子。何妈妈激动地说：“你对我太关心了，比亲儿子还亲。”王祖明说：“我就是您的亲儿子，我是所有贫下中农和劳动人民的儿子，我要全心全意地为劳动人民服务一辈子。”
    去年十月王祖明参加石油企业以后，经常以雷锋、王杰作榜样，把毛主席关于“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，作为行动的准则。
    一天夜间零点，他发现泥浆振动筛上掉了一个黄油嘴，找遍周围每个角落也找不见，他决心找不到就不下班。后来他看到旁边一条小水沟，就顺着水沟摸了起来。班里同志都已下班了，王祖明一个人找了一个多小时，终于在水沟里找回了黄油嘴。大家很关心地问他：“你为啥子不说一声，好让大家帮你找。”他回答说：“毛主席教导我们，每句话每个行动都要向人民负责。我找回黄油嘴来，是对革命事业负责。”
    一次，他作记录搞错了几个数据，接班的记录工说：“你睡觉去吧，我帮你改了就是。”他却回答说：“我们的工作要向人民负责，你帮我把表上的数据改了，但我的马虎思想改不了，还是让我自己改吧！”
    在讨论毛主席的找气找油的指示时，王祖明激动地说：“我们一定要坚决完成毛主席交给的任务。为了找气找油，我死也要死在战斗的岗位上，为中国人民长志气。”
    泥浆沉淀池经常漏泥浆，他每次总是抢先脱掉衣服跳进池里去堵漏。一天半夜，天下着雨，冷风刺骨，泥浆池又漏了。他不顾天冷和碱性很大的泥浆烧皮肤，脱去衣服就跳进泥浆池里。这时队长喊他说：“你快出来，别冻病了，泥浆要烧伤你的皮肤。”同志们要去拉他出来，他却说：“皮肤烧坏是小事，泥浆漏掉影响钻进是大事，我一定把它堵好。”他坚持到堵好了才上来。
    有一次井喷，泥浆把他全身衣服都打湿了，他干脆脱掉衣服，只穿一条短裤坚持操作。喷势越来越猛，必须很快将井喷控制住，否则万一着火，就会给国家带来不可弥补的损失。这时，他就抱起回压凡尔，不顾一切地冲上去，喷出来的泥浆把他推回来，他又一次冲上去，又被推回来。在这危险而又紧张的时刻，他想起了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”再一次冲上去，装上了回压凡尔，安全地控制住了井喷。
    血战火海时，王祖明死守着二号闸门，光荣牺牲。接班的时候，他曾向班长保证：请党放心，天塌下来我也要顶住。干革命就不能怕死，怕死就不能革命。他把执行毛主席的指示变成高度自觉的行动。他忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的光辉形象，永远活在全国人民心中！
