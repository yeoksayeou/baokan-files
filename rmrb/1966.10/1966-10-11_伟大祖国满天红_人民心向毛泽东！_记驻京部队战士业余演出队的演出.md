A giant portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the center of the stage.

Amidst the majestic and stirring sounds of military music and war drums, the amateur performance troupe of the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Beijing began their grand chorus, "The People's Army Marches Forward" and "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End," as part of the workers, peasants, and soldiers' art evening to praise the great leader Chairman Mao.

Accompanied by the majestic music, three soldiers from the ground, naval, and air forces, each with a rifle slung across their chest, stepped onto the stage with a resolute and steadfast gait. They loudly recited, "The great motherland is red all over, the people's hearts turn to Mao Zedong! The great army marches forward, the Red Army's traditions are in our hearts.... The people's army, from nothing to something, from weak to strong, from small to large, who made it possible?" Sixty-odd soldiers from the ground, naval, and air forces, dressed in green military uniforms, stood in formation beneath the portrait of Chairman Mao and loudly responded in unison, "The great Communist Party! The great Mao Zedong!"

The performance of "The People's Army Marches Forward" began with a powerful expression of the soldiers' deep love, faith, and admiration for the beloved leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. This stirred up a strong revolutionary passion among the more than 2,000 spectators. As the performance progressed, the image of the People's Liberation Army, created by Chairman Mao and nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, stood tall on the stage. The entire army responded enthusiastically to the Party Central Committee's call to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work. The lively political atmosphere in various units unfolded before the audience's eyes, one scene after another. The firm and powerful recitation, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," collectively expressed the broad masses of soldiers' resolve to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people. Many moving scenes in the performance stirred the audience's emotions to a boiling point, and the audience frequently erupted in thunderous applause. Many spectators, tears welling up in their eyes, excitedly said: This artistic performance is a vivid and profound lesson in Mao Zedong Thought. We are proud that our motherland has such a great army armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

In just over thirty minutes, the performance sang the heartfelt sentiments of the entire army!

This performance troupe was formed in early September, with over 200 members coming from various combat positions. The majority are model soldiers and active learners of Chairman Mao's works.

For the same goal—to praise Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought—they gathered from all directions and formed a close-knit fighting collective. The scriptwriting team worked tirelessly for three days and nights to create the script. They used the four sentences, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," as the red thread running through the entire script. They selected eight representative marching songs, combined with combat-style dance, spoken word, and poetry recitation performances, starting from Chairman Mao's establishment of the Red Army on Jinggangshan, all the way to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Most of the performers had never stepped onto the stage of the capital before. However, the common voice that erupted from their hearts was:

"We are the children of workers and peasants. We have hearts that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought!"

"We must fully express the feelings of the entire army's infinite love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought through our performance!"

"The workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the cultural revolution. We will plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every ideological battlefield, occupy all stages, and bring glory to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to Chairman Mao!"

The troupe members regarded the performance troupe as a great school for learning Mao Zedong Thought. The rehearsal process was a process of actively applying Chairman Mao's works. Each person had a board with Chairman Mao's quotations, taking it wherever they went and learning wherever they were. With tight schedules and heavy tasks, when they encountered difficulties in rehearsals, they collectively read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Many people kept a picture of Chairman Mao in military uniform in their pockets. They said, "Chairman Mao is by our side, Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours!"

The troupe members infused their deep feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought into every lyric, every note, and every dance move, blending them seamlessly with the entire performance. Nurse Zhao Suqin from a certain air force hospital, a daughter of a coal miner who was once called a "coal dog" by capitalists in the old society, was born in bitterness and grew up under the red flag. In the great revolutionary crucible of the people's army, she joined the Party and became a model soldier and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. Usually, she loved to sing "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" and "Sing a Mountain Song for the Party." She said, "Sing every day, sing every month, sing every year, and you can never sing enough of Chairman Mao's kindness!" Zhao Suqin had never performed on stage before, but she eagerly accepted the task. She said excitedly, "This is not a performance; this is a heartfelt expression of my deepest feelings to the Party and to Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao, how could there be a Zhao Suqin today? How can I not sing with all my heart and soul?"

Some of the musical notes she couldn't sing accurately, so she humbly learned from others, seizing every moment to practice tirelessly. In a short time, she mastered the accompaniment and performance of more than a dozen songs.

Not long ago, members of the amateur performance troupe from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region, who had just returned from promoting Mao Zedong Thought in the Tangshan earthquake disaster area, also participated in the performance.

    “伟大祖国满天红　人民心向毛泽东！”
    ——记驻京部队战士业余演出队的演出
    毛主席巨幅画像悬挂在舞台正中央。
    在雄壮、激昂的军乐声、战鼓声中，中国人民解放军驻京部队陆海空三军战士业余演出队，参加工农兵歌颂伟大领袖毛主席文艺晚会演出的大联唱《人民军队向前进》《把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底》开始了。
    伴随着雄壮的音乐，胸前挎着冲锋枪的陆海空军三名战士，踏着英武、坚定的步伐，走上舞台，高声朗诵：“伟大祖国满天红，人民心向毛泽东！伟大军队向前进，红军传统记心中，……人民军队，从无到有，从弱到强，从小到大靠谁人？”排列在毛主席像下方、身穿草绿色军装的六十多名陆海空军合唱队员，响亮地齐声回答：“伟大的共产党！伟大的毛泽东！”
    《人民军队向前进》演出一开场，就以指战员们对敬爱的领袖毛主席，对伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的真挚感情，激起了全场二千多名观众强烈的革命激情。随着演出，毛主席亲手缔造的，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大的人民解放军的形象巍然挺立在舞台上。全军指战员热烈响应党中央的号召，把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，各部队出现的生气勃勃的政治局面，一幅接一幅在观众眼前展现。坚定有力的朗诵：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，集中表达了广大指战员永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民的决心。演出中许多动人的场面，使观众情绪沸腾，全场不时爆发出一阵阵轰雷似的掌声。许多观众噙着热泪激动地说：这场文艺演出，是一堂最生动、最深刻的毛泽东思想教育课。我们为祖国有这样一支毛泽东思想武装的伟大军队而自豪！
    短短三十多分钟的演出，唱出了全军指战员的心声！
    这个演出队是在九月上旬组成的，二百多名队员，来自不同的战斗岗位，绝大多数是五好战士、学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    为了同一个目标——歌颂毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想，他们从四面八方走到一块来了，紧紧结成一个战斗的集体。编导组的同志们，连续奋战三昼夜，创作出了剧本。他们把“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”这四句话，作为一条红线，贯串剧本的始终。选择八首有代表性的队列歌曲，配合战斗化的舞蹈、说唱、诗朗诵表演，从毛主席在井冈山创建红军唱起，一直唱到毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。
    演员中大多数人从来没有登过首都的大舞台。但是，他们从内心里迸发出的共同声音是：
    “我们是工农的子弟，我们有一颗无限热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的赤胆红心！”
    “我们一定要把全军指战员对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情，通过演出，最充分地表现出来！”
    “工农兵是文化大革命的主力军。我们要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，插遍一切思想阵地，占领所有舞台，为工农兵争光，为毛主席争光！”
    队员们把演出队当作学习毛泽东思想的大学校，排演的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程。他们每人都有一块毛主席语录板，走到那里，带到那里，学到那里。时间紧、任务重，排练碰到困难，他们就集体朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”许多人把毛主席穿军装的像片装在口袋里。他们说：“毛主席就在我们身边，毛主席和我们心连着心！”
    队员们把对毛主席，对毛泽东思想的深厚感情，溶化到了每句唱词、每个音符、每个舞蹈动作中，和整个演出紧紧融汇在一起。空军某医院护理员赵素琴，这个在旧社会被资本家称作“煤狗子”的煤矿工人的孩子，生在苦水里，长在红旗下，在人民军队这所革命大熔炉里入了党，成为五好战士、学习毛主席著作积极分子。平时，她最爱唱《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》《唱支山歌给党听》。她说：“天天唱，月月唱，年年唱，也唱不尽毛主席的恩情！”赵素琴没有登台演过戏，然而，她毫不犹豫地接受下了这个任务。她激动地说：“这不是演戏，这是向党、向毛主席倾述自己最真挚的感情。没有毛主席，哪有今天的赵素琴？叫我怎么能不放开喉咙，纵情歌唱！”有些歌的音符，她唱不准，就虚心向别人学习，争分夺秒，不知疲倦地苦练，在很短时间内，熟练地掌握了十几首歌曲的伴唱和表演。
    不久前从邢台地震灾区宣传毛泽东思想归来的北京部队某部战士业余演出队的同志们也参加了演出。
