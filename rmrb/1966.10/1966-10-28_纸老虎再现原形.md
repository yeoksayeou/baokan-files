After concluding the Manila meeting, Johnson sneaked into Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam and then quietly slipped back to Manila under the cover of night. The president of the world's number one imperialist power, sneaking around like a thief, shows how guilty he feels and how despicable and dirty his deeds are.

At the Manila meeting, Johnson boasted that the United States had "established a shield" in South Vietnam. But how can a "shield" made up of over 300,000 American aggressor troops and 500,000 to 600,000 puppet and mercenary troops possibly block the hatred and fury of 14 million South Vietnamese people against the invaders? However, to gain some political capital for himself, he had to force himself to visit the heavily guarded U.S. military base, take a quick photo, and then flee.

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1946 that "the American reactionaries will also, like all reactionaries in history, be proved to have no real power." Johnson's humiliating trip to Cam Ranh Bay is yet another instance of the U.S. paper tiger revealing its true form as it struggles in the sea of the South Vietnamese people's war.

    纸老虎再现原形
    约翰逊在开完马尼拉会议以后，偷偷溜到南越的金兰湾，又乘着夜色悄悄溜回马尼拉。世界上头号帝国主义国家的总统，这样像小偷似地溜来溜去，可见他是何等的作贼心虚，干的是何等见不得人的卑鄙肮脏的勾当。
    约翰逊在马尼拉会议上吹牛说，美国在南越“已经建立起一个盾牌”。可是，三十多万美国侵略军和五六十万伪军和帮凶军所构成的这面“盾牌”，怎么挡得住一千四百万南越人民对侵略者的仇恨怒火呢？但是，为了给自己捞一点骗人的政治资本，他只好硬着头皮，用这种偷鸡摸狗的方式，到警卫森严的美国军事基地照个面，立刻逃之夭夭。
    毛主席早在一九四六年就指出，“美国反动派也将要同一切历史上的反动派一样，被证明为并没有什么力量。”约翰逊威风扫地的金兰湾之行，正是在南越人民战争的海洋中挣扎的美国纸老虎又一次现出了它的原形。
