The Lao friends sang songs in Chinese praising Chairman Mao, such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "The Glory of Chairman Mao," and "The Golden Mountains of Beijing." The troupe's performer, Mary, stood in front of a giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and recited a poem in Chinese, praising the wise teacher Chairman Mao. She recited:

The sun is bright, the sun is shining,
The sun's rays are boundless.
Great leader Chairman Mao,
You are the red sun in our hearts,
Leading us in revolution,
People around the world love you.

The evening party ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."
