In late July, a large-scale anti-Chinese frenzy erupted in the Aceh region of Sumatra, Indonesia.

Resisting Violence at Night

Late at night, the door of Xiao Lianfa's family home in Kuala Baru was suddenly kicked open. A gang of thugs armed with weapons rushed in and dragged the seven members of Xiao Lianfa's family out of bed. One of the thugs held a sharp knife to Xiao Lianfa's stomach and said, "Why are you still living here! You must leave Aceh by August 1st. Otherwise, my knife will drink your blood!" Then, the thug sneered and said, "You should be smart, give up your Chinese citizenship, join the 'Loyalty Association' (a Kuomintang reactionary organization), and then you can stay, and we won't beat you."

Upon hearing "Loyalty Association," Xiao Lianfa's anger boiled over. He thought, "I am a Chinese, and I will never be a traitor to my nation." He furrowed his brows and stared at the thugs without saying a word. The thugs were frightened by his fearless gaze and slipped away quietly.

Xiao Lianfa, who was 40 years old and born in Indonesia, had always made a living by fitting teeth. He loved the socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao and dared to fight against the Indonesian reactionaries and the Kuomintang bandits. Therefore, the reactionaries saw him as a thorn in their side.

Chairman Mao Gave Him Confidence

On the night of August 2, after midnight, seven or eight thugs broke into Xiao Lianfa's home again and forcibly abducted him to the local police political department. As soon as they arrived at the door, Xiao Lianfa saw that the local government police, military police, and court officials were waiting. Fearful of being exposed, they immediately put Xiao Lianfa in a car and escorted him to a rubber plantation about 30 kilometers away, where he was locked in a tightly sealed cell.

At this moment, Xiao Lianfa, trapped in the den of evil, realized that he was about to face a severe test. However, he noticed the guilty expressions of the right-wing reactionaries and remembered Chairman Mao's statement that all reactionaries are paper tigers. He saw through the reactionaries' weak and cowardly nature, filling his body with the strength to fight and the confidence to win.

The farce of the illegal interrogation of Xiao Lianfa began. On the afternoon of August 6, local government police, military police, and court officials arrived at the rubber plantation with an air of arrogance. The military police chief immediately threatened Xiao Lianfa, demanding that he agree to leave Aceh immediately. Xiao Lianfa replied firmly, "My family has lived here for two generations and has never violated Indonesian laws. Your demand for me to leave is unreasonable."

Exposing the Deception

On the day following Xiao Lianfa's illegal interrogation, the police political department summoned his wife, Zhang Aixian. The police officer feigned concern, saying, "Your husband has been taken away by students, and we don't know where he is, but if you agree to leave, they will release your husband!" Zhang Aixian, a Chinese woman who earned a living by sewing and styling hair, immediately saw through the enemy's plot. She angrily said, "You kidnapped my husband, and these actions are illegal. Release my husband immediately!" The police officer threatened her, saying that if she did not agree to leave, her husband would be beheaded. Zhang Aixian looked at him with contempt and said, "Go ahead and kill him if you dare!"

Two days later, Zhang Aixian was called to the police political department again. This time, the atmosphere was completely different. As soon as the police officer saw her, he rushed up and took out a piece of paper from his pocket, saying, "Your husband has agreed to leave Aceh. This is the letter he wrote to us. Pack your bags and get on the car; he is waiting for you on the way." Zhang Aixian ignored him and angrily said, "Release my husband immediately!"

The reactionaries' plot was once again exposed. Zhang Aixian knew that the enemy would not give up easily, so how should she deal with these cunning and vicious enemies? She thought, with Chairman Mao leading the socialist motherland, there was nothing to fear. She excitedly wrote a letter and secretly sent it to her husband. In the letter, she said: We must never surrender to the enemy and must fight to the end!

Fighting to the End is Victory

Two days later, several thugs armed with knives broke into Zhang Aixian's home. They threatened her with knives, shouting, "We will cut off your head too!" She remained calm and pointed at the thugs, saying, "Go ahead and kill me! All the children are here, kill us all! You can't kill us all, and they will seek revenge!" Her unyielding spirit forced the thugs to leave in defeat.

The farce staged by the local reactionary officials of Indonesia was completely ruined. Through the persistent struggle of Xiao Lianfa and his wife and the severe protests of the overseas Chinese, the right-wing officials had no choice but to release Xiao Lianfa, who had been detained for 16 days and nights. Recently, his entire family returned to the motherland on the Guanghua ship and was warmly welcomed and comforted by the people. They said: Chairman Mao's statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is indeed the absolute truth! In the face of reactionaries, as long as we persist in the struggle, the final victory will be ours!

    我是中国人！
    ——印尼爱国华侨萧连发夫妇抗暴记
    七月下旬，在印度尼西亚苏门答腊亚齐地区，出现了大规模的反华排华狂潮。
    深夜拒暴徒
    深夜，世居瓜拉新邦的华侨萧连发家的门突然被人踢开了。一批手持凶器的暴徒窜进屋里，把萧连发一家七口从床上揪起来。一个暴徒持着尖刀，顶着萧连发的肚子说：“你为什么还住在这里！限你八月一日以前离开亚齐。要不然，我的刀就要喝你们的血！”接着，暴徒狞笑了一下说：“你要聪明点，放弃中国籍，参加‘效忠会’（蒋帮反动组织），就可以住下来，也不会打你们了。”
    萧连发一听到“效忠会”就怒火中烧。他想：“我是个中国人，决不做民族的败类。”他竖起浓眉，一言不发地盯着暴徒。暴徒们被这不畏强暴的目光吓得面面相觑，悄悄地溜走了。
    年满四十岁的出生在印尼的萧连发，一向靠镶牙维持生活。他热爱毛主席领导的社会主义祖国，敢于同印尼反动派和蒋匪帮作斗争。因此，反动派把他看作眼中钉。
    毛主席给了他信心
    八月二日夜间十二时多，七八个暴徒又闯进萧连发的家门，强行把他绑架到当地警察政治部。刚到门前，萧连发就看到当地政府警察、宪兵和法院的人正在等着。他们生怕人们知道似的，立即把萧连发押上汽车，连夜押解到离城三十多公里的一个橡胶园，把他关在一个门窗紧闭的囚室里。
    这时，身陷魔窟的萧连发，意识到自己将要面临严酷的考验了。但是，他看出右派反动分子刚才做贼心虚的神态，想起了毛主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，看穿了反动派外强中干的反动本质，使他全身充满了战斗的力量和胜利的信心。
    非法审讯萧连发的丑剧开始了。八月六日下午，当地政府警察、宪兵和法院的官员，气势汹汹地来到了橡胶园。宪兵头目一开始就威胁萧连发，要他立即答应离开亚齐，萧连发理直气壮地说：“我家两代人都住在这里，从来没有违反过印尼政府的法律。你们迫我离境是无理的。”
    戳穿骗局
    在非法审讯萧连发的第二天，警察政治部传讯萧连发的妻子曾爱仙。警察官假惺惺地说：“你的丈夫被学生抓走了，不知关在那里，但只要你答应离境，他们就会放你丈夫回来！”
    曾爱仙，这个代人缝衣、整发的华侨妇女，一开始便识破了敌人的阴谋，她气愤地说：“你们绑架了我的丈夫，你们干的这些勾当是非法的，快把我的丈夫放回来！”警察官恐吓她，说什么如果她不答应离境，她的丈夫就要被砍头了。曾爱仙以鄙视的眼光扫视着他说：“你们敢杀，就随你们的便！”
    隔了两天，曾爱仙又被叫到警察政治部。这一次传讯完全是另一种气氛。警察官一见到她就迎上来，从口袋里掏出一张纸，说：“你的丈夫已经答应离开亚齐了。这是他写给我们的信。你赶快收拾行李上车，他在半路等着你呢。”曾爱仙不予理睬，愤怒地说：“快快放回我的丈夫！”
    反动派的阴谋又一次被拆穿了。曾爱仙知道敌人是不甘心失败的，怎样对付这些阴险恶毒的敌人呢？她想，有毛主席领导的社会主义祖国作靠山，就什么也不怕。她激动地写了一封信托人秘密地送给丈夫。她在信里说：我们绝不能向敌人低头，要坚持斗争到底！
    坚持斗争就是胜利又过了两天，几个手持尖刀的暴徒闯进曾爱仙家里，他们用尖刀逼着她叫道：“连你的头也要砍！”她面不改色，指着暴徒喝道：“你砍吧！几个孩子都在，把我全家都杀光吧！杀不完，他们就要报仇！”她这种宁死不屈的气概，迫使暴徒们垂头丧气地溜走了。
    印尼反动派地方官员亲自出马演出的丑剧彻底破产了。经过萧连发夫妻的坚持斗争和侨胞们的严重抗议，右派官员不得不把囚禁了十六个日夜的萧连发释放了。最近，他全家乘光华轮回到了祖国的怀抱，受到人民的热烈欢迎和慰问。他们说：毛主席说帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，的确是千真万确的真理啊！在反动派面前，只要我们坚持斗争，最后胜利是属于我们的！
