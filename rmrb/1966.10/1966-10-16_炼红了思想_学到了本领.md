Editor's Note: The following series of articles reflect various aspects of how the younger generation in China is being tempered and grown in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. It is inspiring to read.

The idea of establishing revolutionary schools that combine work, agriculture, culture, and military training has always been advocated by Chairman Mao. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an was established following this guiding ideology. The People's Liberation Army is the best school of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the Jiangxi Communist Labor University, the Tarim Agricultural University, and many factories and enterprises are advancing rapidly along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao's call to turn every industry and profession in the country into a revolutionary school that combines work, agriculture, culture, and military training is increasingly resonating with people. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts are becoming a reality. Thousands of schools of Mao Zedong Thought are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Tens of millions of new communist people are emerging and will continue to emerge from these schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

This is a great and joyous event worth recording and celebrating. By turning every industry and profession in the country into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million people can unite even more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Our socialist cause will flourish even more!

Tempered in Thought, Skilled in Practice

Cao Guoqin, Chairman of the Student Union, Tarim Agricultural University

Our Tarim Agricultural University is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. After graduation, our aspiration is not to seek personal fame and fortune, but to sincerely serve the people and be willing to be a "1079" cadre (a cadre who carries a shoulder pole, wears a straw hat, uses a spade, and carries a dung bucket).

Over the past few years, we have tempered our thoughts and acquired skills in this school. Our feelings have undergone a fundamental change.

Chairman Mao said, "...the cleanest are the workers, peasants, though their hands may be dirty and their feet may have cow dung on them, they are still cleaner than the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeois intellectuals." We often use Chairman Mao's words to examine ourselves and remove bourgeois dirty thoughts from our minds.

Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, we have cultivated a firm will to shoulder heavy burdens and face difficulties head-on, as well as a revolutionary spirit of enduring hardships and hard work.

To seize grain and cotton from the saline-alkali land in Tarim, we students have turned our class hatred into spades and are determined to make a revolution on the saline-alkali land. Last winter and this spring, we students worked day and night, hauling sand, digging pits, and improving the saline-alkali land. Our female students worked alongside the male students. We firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to endure hardships, and daring to fight continuously (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." After hauling sand all night, we still went to collect fertilizer and dig licorice with our classmates in the morning. Early spring irrigation is a heavy and arduous farm work. Usually, it is done by male students, but we female students also volunteered to do it.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must make all young people understand that our country is still a very poor country... It all depends on the young people and all the people uniting and struggling for several decades to create a prosperous and strong country with their own hands." Frugality is the school spirit of this Anti-Japanese University-style school. Through labor, we deeply understand how hard it is to obtain a single grain of rice or an ounce of cotton. We rarely spend money recklessly. We cut our own hair, mend our own clothes and shoes. Although we only have two yuan of living expenses per month, we still have some money saved in the savings bank.

In this revolutionary school, we not only study politics and technology but also agriculture and industry. We are not only farmers but also workers and militia members, and everyone knows how to use a gun. As soon as the motherland gives the order, we will immediately pick up our guns to thoroughly eliminate any daring invaders. We are also critics of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and we are the buriers of the bourgeois education system. No matter what "authority" or "expert" it is, as long as it does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will thoroughly criticize it. We actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We guarantee: to devote our lives to the revolution, to study Chairman Mao's works for life, to reform our thoughts for life, and to be an ordinary laborer for life.

### 炼红了思想　学到了本领

    编者按：下面刊登的一组稿件，从不同的侧面反映了我国年青一代在毛泽东思想大学校里锻炼成长的情况，读来令人鼓舞。
    办亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，是毛主席一贯的思想。
    抗日战争时期的延安抗日军政大学，就是按照毛主席这一指导思想办起来的。解放军是最好的毛泽东思想的大学校。现在，新疆生产建设兵团、江西共产主义劳动大学、塔里木农垦大学，以及许多工厂企业，正沿着毛主席指引的道路大踏步地前进。
    毛主席发出的把全国各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大号召，日益深入人心，毛主席这一光辉思想正在变为现实。千百座毛泽东思想的大学校正像雨后春笋般地发展起来。亿万共产主义新人正在和将要从毛泽东思想大学校里涌现出来。
    这是值得大书特书的大好事，是值得放声高歌的大喜事。
    把全国各行各业都办成毛泽东思想的大学校，七亿人民就可以在毛泽东思想的旗帜下更加紧密地团结起来。我们的社会主义事业就会更加兴旺起来！
    炼红了思想　学到了本领
    塔里木农垦大学学生会主席　曹国琴
    我们塔里木农垦大学，是一所毛泽东思想的大学校。我们毕业后的志愿，不是个人成名成家，而是老老实实为人民服务，甘当一名“1079”干部（“1”是扁担一根，“0”是笠帽一顶，“7”是坎土镘一把，“9”是粪瓢一只）。
    几年来，我们在这所学校里，炼红了思想，学到了本领。我们的感情经历了一个根本的转变。
    毛主席说：“……最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”我们经常用毛主席的话检查自己，来除去我们头脑中资产阶级的脏思想。
    通过活学活用毛主席著作，还培养了我们敢于挑重担，敢于迎着困难前进的坚强意志，和吃大苦、耐大劳的革命精神。
    为了向塔里木的盐碱地夺粮、夺棉，同学们把阶级仇恨凝结在坎土镘上，要在盐碱板上闹革命。去年冬末、今年春初，同学们不分白天黑夜，拉沙、挖坑、改良盐碱板。我们女同学和男同学一齐动手。我们牢记毛主席的教导：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”晚上拉了一夜沙，早晨还和同学去积肥、挖甘草。早春灌溉，是较重较苦的农活。一般都由男同学干，我们女同学也抢着干。
    毛主席教导我们：“要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家，现在还是一个很穷的国家……全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。”艰苦朴素，是我们这个抗大式的大学的校风。同学们通过劳动，深知一粒米、一两棉花来之不易，大家轻易不乱花一分钱。同学们自己理发，自己缝补衣服、鞋子。虽然我们每月只有二元钱生活费，但还有余钱存在小银行里。
    在这所革命的大学校里，我们不仅学政治、学技术，还学农、学工。我们不仅是农民，也是工人，还是民兵，人人会打枪。只要祖国一声令下，我们马上拿起枪杆，去彻底消灭敢于来犯的敌人。我们也是资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的批判者，是资产阶级教育制度的埋葬者。不管是什么“权威”，什么“专家”，只要不符合毛泽东思想，我们就要彻底批判。我们积极参加无产阶级文化大革命运动，坚决完成一斗二批三改的任务。我们保证：干一辈子革命，学习一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，当一辈子普通劳动者。（附图片）
