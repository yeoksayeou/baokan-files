According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, October 4th, according to a report from the Cambodian News Agency on the 4th, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on September 28th, strongly protesting the aggressive act of two helicopters from the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army that attacked a Cambodian military outpost in Kampong Speu Province on September 20th.

The statement said: "The Royal Government wants to point out to international public opinion that this obvious act of deliberate aggression rules out any possibility of misunderstanding. In fact, the aforementioned Cambodian outpost was easily recognizable because the Cambodian national flag was flying at the top of the flagpole in the center of the outpost when it was attacked, and the house that was hit by a rocket also had Cambodian national flags painted on both sides of the roof."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 5th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 5th, strongly condemning the crime of the U.S. imperialists and the Saigon puppet regime bombing a Cambodian outpost in Kampong Speu Province.

The statement pointed out that the shameless actions of U.S. imperialism and the Saigon puppet regime exposed the deceitful hypocrisy of the claim that the United States wants to "improve relations" with Cambodia and "respect" Cambodia's neutrality and territorial integrity.

The statement said, "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people unreservedly support the correct position stated in the Cambodian Royal Government's statement on September 28, 1966."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, October 7th, according to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on the 6th: A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning the crime of the U.S. imperialists and their Saigon lackeys attacking a Cambodian military outpost in Kampong Speu Province.

The statement said, the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people will forever stand together with the fraternal Cambodian people, to jointly fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to safeguard the true peace, neutrality, and independence of the two countries.

    越南外交部和老挝爱国战线党支持柬埔寨政府正义立场
    据新华社金边四日电  据柬埔寨新闻社四日报道，柬埔寨王国政府在九月二十八日发表声明，强烈抗议美国—南越伪军的两架直升飞机，在九月二十日袭击柬埔寨桔井省的省防军哨所的侵略罪行。
    声明说：“王国政府要向国际舆论指出，这一明显的蓄意侵略行动排斥了一切误会的可能性。事实上，上述柬埔寨哨所是容易辨认的，因为在哨所遭受侵略时，哨所中央旗杆顶端的柬埔寨国旗正在飘扬，而且遭到一枚火箭射击的房屋房顶两侧也涂有柬埔寨国旗。”
    据新华社河内五日电越南民主共和国外交部五日发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义和西贡傀儡政权轰炸柬埔寨桔井省一个哨所的罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义和西贡傀儡政权的无耻行动揭穿了关于美国希望同柬埔寨“改善关系”和“尊重”柬埔寨的中立与领土完整的骗人的伪善论调。
    声明说，“越南民主共和国政府和越南人民无保留地支持柬埔寨王国政府在一九六六年九月二十八日的声明中所阐明的正确立场。”
    据新华社康开七日电据巴特寮电台六日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人六日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其西贡走狗袭击柬埔寨桔井省省防军哨所的罪行。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民将永远同兄弟的柬埔寨人民团结一起，为反对美帝国主义及其走狗而进行共同斗争，维护两国的真正和平、中立和独立。
