The friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China play a crucial role in maintaining peace in Asia and in the struggle to drive American imperialism out of Asia.

Especially now, as American imperialism continues to escalate its aggression in Vietnam and frequently provokes China, the situation has become extremely urgent and serious. In this context, China has consistently stood by the Vietnamese people, resolute in not yielding an inch.

In this situation, the movement for friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China has become more urgent and important than ever before. At this critical moment, if we maintain and expand the friendship and unity between the peoples of Japan and China, it will not only be in the interests of the peoples of Japan and China but will also be a great support for the Vietnamese people.

The Japan-China friendship exchange movement has been continuously obstructed by American imperialism and its followers, and this obstruction has become even more complex recently. Recently, within our movement, a force obstructing friendly exchanges has emerged, which, as everyone knows, is a well-known fact.

This obstruction, no matter how it is justified, can only serve to aid the anti-China policy of the anti-China forces led by the United States, and will have no other outcome.

This obstruction must not only be eliminated from our Japan-China Friendship Association but must also be completely and thoroughly eliminated from all areas of Japan-China friendly exchanges to clear the way for Japan-China friendly exchanges.

The development of the Japan-China friendship movement is an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop. At the same time, the Japan-China friendly exchange movement, including the activities of our Japan-China Friendship Association, has already reached a stage where it has sufficient strength to overcome any obstacles.

This national movement is unstoppable by anyone. Whoever tries to obstruct it will suffer. Let us eliminate all obstacles and make our friendly exchange movement increasingly expand, deepen, and strengthen! With this firm conviction, I conclude the Japan-China Friendship Association's congratulatory message on the third anniversary of the establishment of the China-Japan Friendship Association.

For the development of the Japan-China friendship movement and for the health of all present, cheers!

    日中友协副会长黑田寿男的贺词
    日中两国人民的友好团结，对于维护亚洲和平以及把美帝国主义从亚洲赶出去的斗争，起着极其重要的作用。
    特别是，现在美帝国主义正在不断扩大侵略越南的战争，而且还时常对中国进行挑衅活动。在这种紧迫的严重形势下，中国始终一贯地站在越南人民一边，决心寸步不让。
    在这种形势下，日中两国人民的友好团结运动，已经成为比过去任何时候都更加紧急而重要的运动了。在这个时候，如果维护、并且扩大日中两国人民友好团结，那就不仅符合日中两国人民的利益，而且对越南人民也必然是一个巨大的支援。
    日中友好往来运动，一直不断地受到美帝国主义及其追随者的阻挠，而且这种阻挠行径最近变得更加复杂了。近来，在我们运动内部出现了一股阻挠友好往来的势力，这不用我在这里说明，已经是尽人皆知的事情了。
    这种阻挠，无论怎样加以辩解，其结果只能是为以美国为首的反华势力的反华政策帮忙，除此以外，不会再有别的后果。
    这种阻挠，不仅必须从我们日中友好协会中排除出去，而且必须从日中友好往来的一切领域中全部、彻底地排除出去，以扫清日中友好交往的大道。
    日中友好运动的发展，是任何力量也无法阻挡的巨大历史潮流。同时，日中友好交往运动，当然包括我们日中友好协会的活动在内，现阶段已经具有足够的力量排除任何障碍。
    这个国民运动，是任何人都阻挡不了的，谁想阻挡它，谁就会倒霉。让我们排除一切障碍，使我们的友好往来运动日益扩大、加深和增强吧！我以这种坚强的信心，来结束我们日中友好协会对中日友好协会成立三周年的贺词。
    为了日中友好运动的发展，为了在座各位的健康，干杯！
