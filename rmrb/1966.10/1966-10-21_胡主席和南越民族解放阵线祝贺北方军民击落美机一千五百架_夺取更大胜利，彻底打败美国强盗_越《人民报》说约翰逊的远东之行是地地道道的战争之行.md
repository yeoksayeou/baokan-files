Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 20th

On the 19th, Chairman Hu Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government, wrote a letter to all units, people, and cadres in North Vietnam, commending them for their brilliant achievement of shooting down 1,500 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The letter said, on October 14, 1966, the military and civilians of Nghe An Province shot down the 1,500th U.S. aggressor aircraft, which is a great achievement of the northern military and civilians. At the same time, the southern military and civilians have also achieved many brilliant victories.

The letter said that the U.S. aggressors, in order to get out of their predicament, are frantically escalating their aggression. The more they take risks, the more they will suffer heavy defeats.

The letter called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to carry forward their victories, unite closely, heighten vigilance, overcome all difficulties, carry forward the tradition of heroic struggle, actively launch production and combat competitions, and resolutely defeat the U.S. aggressors, achieve more and greater victories, and bring the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to a complete victory.

On the 18th, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam sent separate telegrams to the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, warmly congratulating the military and civilians of North Vietnam on their brilliant victory of shooting down 1,500 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The telegram from the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam said that the people of South Vietnam learn from the heroic example of the northern military and civilians, and with the full support of 17 million compatriots in the north, are more confident in defeating the U.S. aggressors and achieving final victory.

The telegram said that the people of the south are steadfast, fearless of sacrifice, unafraid of hardship, and resolutely advance, striking hard, accurately, and continuously at the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, determined to make the enemy, who suffered a shameful defeat in the rainy season, suffer an even heavier defeat in the upcoming dry season.

The telegram from the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam said that this brilliant victory of the northern military and civilians shows the invincible power of the entire people's armed forces and the boundless strength of 17 million northern compatriots. The telegram emphasized that the military and civilians of South Vietnam will not hesitate to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and resolutely defeat the U.S. aggressors' new counteroffensive plans, achieving greater victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 19th

The People's Daily of Vietnam published a commentary on the 19th about U.S. President Johnson's personal trip to six countries and regions in the Far East to engage in intrigue, pointing out that Johnson's Far East trip is a pure war trip.

The commentary said that the main purpose of Johnson's Far East trip is to coerce its lackeys into further actively participating in the U.S.'s ever-expanding war of aggression in Vietnam.

The commentary said that although nearly 50,000 troops from the U.S.'s lackeys have been sacrificed in the war of aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. military has suffered a crushing defeat on the battlefield in Vietnam, and the number of casualties is increasing day by day. Therefore, Johnson went to the Far East to coerce its lackeys to provide more cannon fodder for the U.S.'s war of aggression in Vietnam.

The commentary went on to say that Johnson wants to cover up the face of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Asia to get out of the isolation of the United States in the world. At the same time, he is pushing the already stale "peace talks" to try to save U.S. imperialism from its predicament in South Vietnam.

The commentary emphasized that the more Johnson talks about peace in Vietnam, the more he is actually promoting the war; the more Johnson talks about morality and humanity, the more he is actually preparing for more barbaric and brutal criminal activities in Vietnam.

The commentary pointed out that Johnson's Far East trip will not bring any benefits to the U.S. aggressors, on the contrary, it will only make the difficulties of the U.S. aggressors increase indefinitely.

    胡主席和南越民族解放阵线祝贺北方军民击落美机一千五百架
    夺取更大胜利，彻底打败美国强盗
    越《人民报》说约翰逊的远东之行是地地道道的战争之行
    新华社河内二十日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明十九日代表越南劳动党中央和政府写信给越南北方全体部队、人民和干部，表彰他们击落一千五百架美国强盗飞机的辉煌战功。
    信里说，一九六六年十月十四日，义安省军民击落第一千五百架美国强盗飞机，这是北方军民的巨大成绩。同时，南方军民也取得了许多辉煌的胜利。
    信里说，美国强盗为了摆脱窘境，正在疯狂地加强侵略战争。它越冒险，就越要遭到惨重的失败。
    信里号召越南北方军民发扬已经取得的胜利，紧密团结，提高警惕，克服一切困难，发扬英勇斗争的传统，积极展开战斗和生产竞赛，坚决战胜美国侵略强盗，夺取更多更大的战绩，使抗美救国事业取得彻底胜利。
    新华社河内二十日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，十八日分别打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落美国强盗飞机一千五百架的辉煌胜利。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的电报说，越南南方人民学习英雄的北方军民的榜样，在一千七百万北方骨肉同胞的全力支援下，对打败美国侵略强盗、取得最后胜利更加充满了信心。
    贺电说，南方人民坚定不移，不畏牺牲，不怕艰苦，坚决勇往直前，狠狠地、准准地、连续地打击美国侵略者及其走狗，决心使在雨季中已经遭到可耻失败的敌人，在即将到来的旱季中遭到更为惨重的失败。
    越南南方解放武装力量指挥部的电报说，北方军民的这一辉煌胜利显示了全民武装的无敌力量，显示了一千七百万北方同胞的无穷无尽的力量。电报强调指出，越南南方军民将不惜牺牲，克服一切困难，坚决打败美国强盗的新的反攻计划，夺取更大的胜利。
    新华社河内十九日电　越南《人民报》十九日就美国总统约翰逊亲自出马到远东六个国家和地区进行阴谋活动发表评论指出，约翰逊的远东之行是地地道道的战争之行。
    评论说，约翰逊这次远东之行的主要目的是胁迫它的仆从进一步积极参加美国不断扩大的侵越战争。
    评论说，在侵越战争中尽管美国的仆从为它献出了近五万名军队，但是，美军在越南战场上遭到惨败，伤亡人数日益增加。因此，约翰逊到远东活动去加紧胁迫它的仆从为美国的侵越战争提供更多的炮灰。
    评论接着说，约翰逊想要掩盖美帝国主义对亚洲的侵略面目，以摆脱美国在世界上的孤立。同时，他又加紧推销已经发霉的“和平讨论”货色，企图挽救美帝国主义在越南南方的窘境。
    评论强调指出，约翰逊越是侈谈越南和平，正是他在实际上加紧促进战争；约翰逊越是侈谈道德和人道，正是他在实际上准备在越南进行更加野蛮和残暴的罪恶活动。
    评论指出，约翰逊远东之行决不能给美国侵略者带来什么好处，恰恰相反，它只能使美国侵略者的困难日益无限地增加。
