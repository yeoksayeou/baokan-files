Recently, the active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Nanjing Military Region's artillery unit held a meeting to share their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Articles." They spoke passionately about how studying and applying the "Three Articles" has transformed their worldviews. Everyone unanimously shouted, "Long live the 'Three Articles'!"

Platoon Leader Wu Weizhong has always followed Chairman Mao's instructions since joining the army. He has done a lot for everyone and is known as a "Leifeng-style good soldier." He said:

"The 'Three Articles' are the fundamentals of being a person.

When I was in middle school, I thought that since the revolution had been victorious, the predecessors had planted trees for us to enjoy. I only cared about my own life and didn't care about others' difficulties, thinking that helping others was an extra thing to do. After joining the army, I studied 'In Memory of Norman Bethune.' Chairman Mao said, 'All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other.' These words shook me: If the predecessors planted trees of happiness, can we just enjoy them without mutual aid? Chairman Mao said to the youth, 'The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you.' Chairman Mao has placed great hopes in us, hoping that we will be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause; the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries also have 'hopes' for us, hoping that we will be the successors of the bourgeoisie. I made up my mind: I must firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and become a successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

My thoughts changed, and so did my feelings. I felt that everything was my responsibility, and there was work to be done everywhere. Our company is not near any street or town. When comrades' shoes wore out, it was inconvenient to repair them, and it was a waste to throw them away. I bought a set of shoe repair tools and started repairing shoes for everyone. The first time I repaired a shoe, the owner was not satisfied and had it redone. I didn't say anything, but I thought, 'They worked so hard, and you can't even be patient.' But I immediately realized that this thought was wrong and put down my tools to reread 'In Memory of Norman Bethune.' Serving the people means not only being diligent but also being patient with complaints, having the spirit of 'bowing my head to be an ox for the children.' Otherwise, I could neither be diligent nor patient with complaints. So, I redid the shoe three times, and finally, the owner was satisfied.

In three years, I repaired over 300 pairs of shoes. Repairing shoes took up a lot of my rest time, and I felt that time was tight. Later, I repaired fewer shoes. Some comrades wondered, 'Why did Wu Weizhong suddenly repair fewer shoes?' The comrades' questions made me think: 300 pairs of shoes were repaired in three years, and during these three years, I never felt that time was tight, so why did I suddenly feel that time was tight now? I brought this question to my study of Chairman Mao's words: 'It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do bad deeds, to always benefit the broad masses, to always benefit the youth, to always benefit the revolution, to struggle hard for decades like one day. This is the most difficult!' Chairman Mao's words made me realize that serving the people, 'bowing my head to be an ox for the children,' is a lifelong matter, not just a temporary one. I can't relax after doing it for a while. From then on, in addition to repairing shoes, I actively did everything beneficial to the revolution and the people. I decided to serve the people for life and be an 'ox for the children' for life.

Deputy Political Instructor Xu Xianwan, after becoming an officer, demanded even more of himself as a servant of the people. He lived and worked with the soldiers. He said:

"The more I study the 'Three Articles,' the more revolutionary enthusiasm I have.

When I was promoted to platoon leader, my position and treatment changed. I repeatedly studied the 'Three Articles' and felt that in one's life, there will be many changes, but serving the people must never change.

The party branch stipulated that officers should inspect the barracks and sentries once a week. I thought, Chairman Mao taught us: officers must care for every soldier. I must let the soldiers sleep well and not catch a cold. So, I decided to inspect the barracks and sentries every night. But I sleep deeply, and once I lie down, I don't wake up. Later, I drank a lot of hot water before sleeping, so even if I slept soundly, I would wake up due to the pressure. Day after day, it became a habit, and I insisted on inspecting the barracks and sentries every day. One night, I encountered a new soldier on sentry duty. He shouted from afar, 'Who's there!' I replied, 'Xu Xianwan.' When I got to him, he said, 'Why didn't you say you're the second platoon leader?' I said, 'Why must I say 'leader'?' He said, 'Officers don't say 'leader,' their words don't carry weight.' This is an old way of thinking. In our revolutionary ranks, officers and soldiers are all servants of the people. The relationship between officers and soldiers is that of class brothers, not that of superiors and subordinates. As for whether the words carry weight, it doesn't depend on whether you are a 'leader' or not. The fundamental thing is whether it embodies Mao Zedong Thought. If it embodies Mao Zedong Thought, it carries weight even without saying 'leader'; if it doesn't embody Mao Zedong Thought, it doesn't carry weight no matter what 'leader' you are. After that, I paid more attention to blending in with the soldiers.

This year, when distributing summer uniforms, I saw that each soldier was given a pair of elastic-mouth cloth shoes, and I kept thinking about buying a pair. Although I didn't buy it in the end, why did the thought keep coming to my mind? I brought this question to my study of 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and realized that my economic conditions had improved, and I began to think about enjoying life, thinking that a pair of cloth shoes wouldn't cost much, and if my hand was loose, I could buy it, and if it was tight, I could not buy it. The hand is controlled by the mind, and the shoes are not something we can't wear. Between this looseness and tightness, there are two worldviews. Through this incident, I deeply realized that what I lacked was not shoes but Mao Zedong Thought. So, I bought some single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. An old comrade came to visit me and saw that in my bundle, except for soldiers' clothes, there were only Chairman Mao's works. He asked, 'Is this all your 'property'?' I thought, this is not little; it's enough for me to use for a lifetime. Whether a servant of the people is 'armed' with material things or with ideology is a big issue related to whether one changes or not and whether one can carry the revolution through to the end. The more personal material 'property' one has, the more harmful it is. Only by letting Mao Zedong Thought fill one's mind more and more, and root deeper and deeper, can one always be a servant of the people, and revolutionary enthusiasm can be more and more abundant.

Platoon Leader Yang Xianwen has remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of never leaving the masses since the day he joined the army. He has always been closely connected with the people and is known as the 'good son of the people.' He said:

"The more I study the 'Three Articles,' the deeper my class feelings become.

Chairman Mao taught us to 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people. How can we achieve this? I think, to truly achieve this, we must first have deep class feelings, always remember that the laboring people are our parents, and always remember that we are the sons of the laboring people.

When we moved to the countryside to do mass work, there was a poor peasant named Gao Dama in the production team. She was over sixty years old and lived alone, finding it inconvenient. Could we help her out? Chairman Mao taught us to be extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. When the poor and lower-middle peasants have difficulties, we cannot just watch and do nothing. This is the time to test how deep our class feelings are.

So, I decided to take over her household chores, no matter how hard the work was, I went every day to reduce her burden as much as possible. One day, she brought me a bowl of steamed egg to eat, and I politely declined. Dama said, 'You only do things and don't eat, how can I thank you?' I led Dama to Chairman Mao's portrait and said, 'It is he who told me to care for the people's lives. If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao.' Dama stood on her tiptoes, touched Chairman Mao's portrait with her hand, and cried, 'You old man, may you live forever. I will follow your words all my life and follow you all my life.' I was happy from the bottom of my heart to do something for the people, and the people loved Chairman Mao and socialism even more. I was overjoyed.

Medical Orderly Jiang Tianzhu seriously studied Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication, and did everything he could to improve the medical work, and was praised by the soldiers as a 'Red Medical Orderly.' He said:

"The more I study the 'Three Articles,' the stronger my sense of responsibility becomes.

Before I joined the army, I worked as a doctor in a local hospital. After joining the army, I was assigned to be a medical orderly in the company, and I couldn't understand it. In the company, I studied 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' and 'Serve the People,' which made me realize that to wholeheartedly serve the people, one must not only be willing to be 'big materials in small use' but also be as responsible for the work as Bethune. At first, I thought that if I went to see the patients whenever they called, I had done my duty of selflessness and dedication. Later, I thought that going to see the patients whenever they called could not prevent the occurrence of patients, and it could not be said that I was extremely responsible for the work. So, I helped the cooks improve the kitchen hygiene, personally cleaned the weeds in the camp, dredged the sewage ditch, and propagated hygiene knowledge to everyone. Doing medical work this way seemed to be more responsible than when I was a doctor in a local hospital, but from the requirement of being extremely responsible for the work, what I did was still far from enough. I saw the officers inspecting the barracks and sentries at night, which was also being extremely responsible for the work. So, I often went to the classes to help the soldiers tuck in their mosquito nets and cover their blankets. After a long time, I knew who liked to kick off the blankets and who liked to open the mosquito nets, and I inspected them first when inspecting the barracks.

In the past, when I was a doctor, I never thought of doing such specific things. This incident made me deeply realize that 'extreme' is the high standard of being a person beneficial to the people. To truly achieve 'extreme responsibility for the work,' one must have 'extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people'; only with 'extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people' can one have 'extreme responsibility for the work.' After that, I strictly followed these two extremes as standards to do a good job in medical work. I thought of the 74-year-old Wang Ayi in the nearby production team. She had been a hired laborer for most of her life and was tortured by the landlord into being half-paralyzed, lying in bed and unable to turn over. I treated Ayi as my own mother and went to give her acupuncture every day at noon. More than five months later, the woman who had been paralyzed for more than a decade finally got out of bed and walked out the door to see the new world after liberation for the first time. Ayi couldn't help but cry, 'Chairman Mao! This old woman is blessed by you, old man!' It was only then that I thought, like me, an ordinary medical worker, daring to treat such a difficult case, this is also thanks to the great power of Mao Zedong Thought!

The meeting was very lively. Speech after speech, experience after experience, all vividly and concretely showed that the 'Three Articles' are a motto, a compulsory course for transforming worldviews. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would not only study and apply the 'Three Articles' for life but also, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, lead the way in learning and applying, and lead the troops to study and apply the 'Three Articles' more widely and deeply, and carry out a thorough revolution in the depths of their souls.

    “老三篇”万岁！
    ——解放军南京部队炮兵学习“老三篇”讲用会纪要
    最近，人民解放军南京部队炮兵学习毛主席著作积极分子代表，怀着无限的激情，举行了活学活用毛主席光辉著作“老三篇”的讲用会，畅谈活学活用“老三篇”改造世界观的体会。大家一致高呼：“老三篇”万岁！
    班长吴慰忠入伍以来，一贯照毛主席的指示办事，为大家做了大量好事，被同志们称为“雷锋式的好战士”。他说：
    “老三篇”是做人的根本
    我上中学时认为，现在革命胜利了，前人种树后人乘凉嘛。我光管自己的生活，不管别人的困难，认为帮助别人是份外的事情。入伍后，我学习了《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”这句话震动了我：前人种下幸福树，后人能自管自不讲互助吗？毛主席对青年说：“世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”毛主席把无限希望寄托在我们身上，希望我们做无产阶级革命事业的接班人；帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派也把“希望”寄托在我们身上，“希望”我们做资产阶级的接班人。我下定决心：坚决要走毛主席指引的道路，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    思想变了，感情也变了，我觉得满眼都是份内的事情，到处都有该做的工作。我们连驻地不挨街也不靠镇，同志们的鞋子穿破了，修补不方便，丢了又可惜，我就去买来一套补鞋工具，动手给大家补鞋。第一次补鞋，主人嫌不好，拆了叫我重补。我嘴里没说心里想：“人家辛辛苦苦，你还不能将就将就。”但我马上意识到这个想法不对，立即放下工具，重温《为人民服务》。为人民服务不仅要任劳，也要任怨，要有“俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，否则就既不能做到任劳，更不能做到任怨。于是，我三番五次的返工，终于补好了第一双鞋子，对方也满意了。
    三年里，我先后给大家修补了三百多双鞋子。补鞋用去了我大量的休息时间，我感到时间紧，后来补鞋也就少了。有的同志不解地说：“吴慰忠补鞋怎么突然少了？”同志们的疑问引起了我的深思：三百双鞋子是在三年内补的，三年里我都没有感到时间紧，怎么现在突然感觉时间紧了呢？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的这样一条语录：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”毛主席的话使我认识到，为人民服务，“俯首甘为孺子牛”，是一辈子的事情，不是一阵子的事情，不能做一阵就松气。从此，我除了修补鞋子，凡是对革命、对人民有利的事，都主动去做。我决心毕生为人民服务，毕生“俯首甘为孺子牛”。
    副指导员许先万当上干部以后，就更严格地以人民的勤务员来要求自己，生活和战士在一起，工作和战士一样干。他说：
    “老三篇”越学，革命干劲越足
    上级提升我当排长，职务变了，待遇也变了。我反复学习了“老三篇”，觉得人的一生中，会遇到不少这样那样的变动，千变万变，为人民服务要永远不变。
    党支部规定干部每周有一次查铺查哨。我想，毛主席教导我们：干部要关心每一个战士。我得让战士们睡得好，不受凉。于是，我决定每天夜里都起来查铺查哨。可是我睡心重，躺上床就不醒。后来我就在睡觉前猛喝开水，这样，睡得再甜也给胀醒了，日久天长就成了习惯，坚持了每天查铺查哨。有一天夜里，我碰上一个新战士站哨，他老远就喊：“谁！”我回答说：“许先万”。等我走到他跟前，他说：“你怎么不讲是二排长呢？”我说：“为什么非带‘长’不可呢？”他说：“干部不带‘长’，说话都不响。”这可是一种旧思想，咱们革命队伍的干部和战士一样，都是人民的勤务员，干部战士是阶级兄弟关系，不能动不动都带“长”。至于讲话响不响，不在于是不是“长”，根本的在于是不是体现了毛泽东思想，是体现毛泽东思想的话，不带“长”也响；不是体现毛泽东思想的话，不管你是什么“长”也不响。以后，我更加注意和战士打成一片。
    今年发放夏服时，我看战士每人发了一双松紧口的布鞋，心里就转来转去想买一双穿。虽然最后没有买，但为什么脑子里打转呢？我带着这个问题学习《为人民服务》，发觉自己经济条件宽裕了，开始想享受了，以为一双布鞋花不了多少钱，手松一点就买了，紧一点也可以不买。手是受思想支配的，鞋子又不是没得穿，这一松一紧之间，包含着两种世界观。通过这件事，我深深地认识到自己缺少的不是鞋子，而是毛泽东思想。于是我又买了一些毛主席著作单行本。有位老战友来看我，见我包袱里除了战士衣物，就是毛主席著作，便问我：“你就这么点‘家当’呀？”我想，这不算少了，够我用一辈子的。一个人民的勤务员，是从物质上“武装”自己，还是从思想上武装自己，这是关系到变不变质、能否把革命进行到底的大问题。个人的物质“家当”越大越害人，只有让毛泽东思想在自己的头脑里越装越多，越扎越深，才能永远做人民的勤务员，革命干劲才能越来越充沛。
    排长杨先稳从入伍那一天起，就牢记毛主席的一刻也不脱离群众的教导，走到哪里都紧密地联系人民群众，被群众称为“人民的好儿子”。他说：
    “老三篇”越学，阶级感情越深
    毛主席教导我们“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务，怎样才能做到？我想，要真正做到，首先要有深厚的阶级感情，要做到永远不忘劳动人民是我们的父母，永远不忘我们是劳动人民的儿子。
    在我们住进农村去做群众工作的时候，生产队里有位贫农高大娘，六十多岁了，一个人生活不方便。能不能为她出点力呢？毛主席教导我们，对同志对人民要极端的热忱。贫下中农有了困难，我们不能看着不管。这正是检验我们阶级感情深不深的时候。
    于是，我决心把她的家务活包下来，不管工作有多累，我每天都要去，尽一切力量减少她的劳累。有一天，她端来一碗合包蛋要我吃，我婉言谢绝了。大娘说：“光做事情不吃东西，叫我怎么谢你呢？”我把大娘领到毛主席像跟前，说：“是他老人家叫我关心群众生活的，你要谢就谢毛主席。”大娘踮起脚跟，用手摸着毛主席的像，淌着泪说：“你老人家万福，我一辈子听你的话，一辈子跟你走。”我为人民做点事，人民更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱社会主义，我打心眼里高兴。
    卫生员江天柱认真学习白求恩毫不利己专门利人的精神，千方百计搞好卫生工作，被战士们誉为“红色卫生员”。他说：
    “老三篇”越学，革命责任心越强
    我入伍前，在地方医院当医生。入伍后，叫我下连当卫生员，我想不通。到连队学习了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，使我认识到，要全心全意为人民服务，不但要乐于“大材小用”，还要像白求恩那样对工作极端的负责任才行。
    开初，我觉得有了病号随叫随到，就算做到了毫不利己专门利人，以后我想，随叫随到并不能制止病号的产生，还不能算对待工作极端的负责任。于是，我又帮助炊事员搞好伙房卫生，自己动手打扫营区杂草、疏通污水沟，向大家宣传卫生常识。这样做卫生工作，看来比在地方医院当医生时，要负责任得多，但从对工作极端负责任的要求来看，光做这点事还差得很远。我看干部们夜里查铺查哨，这也是对工作极端的负责任嘛，于是，我也常到班里去给战士们压蚊帐、盖被子。时间一长，谁爱蹬被子，谁爱开蚊帐，我就有数了，查铺首先查他们。
    过去我当医生，想也没想过要干这样的具体事情。这件事使我深刻认识到，“极端”是做一个有益于人民的人的高标准，要真正做到“对工作的极端的负责任”，必须有“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”；只有“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，才能有“对工作的极端的负责任”。以后，我就严格地以这两个极端为标准，做好卫生工作。我想到附近生产队七十四岁的王阿婆，当了大半辈子雇工，被地主折磨成半身不遂，一直躺在床上不能翻身。我把阿婆当成自己的母亲，每天中午去给她针灸。五个多月后，瘫痪了十几年的阿婆终于下床来，走出门，第一次看见了解放以后的新光景。阿婆情不自禁地淌着眼泪说：“毛主席呀！我老婆子是托你老人家的福啊！”这时我才想到，像我这样一个普普通通的医务工作者，敢于治疗这样难治之症，这也是托了毛泽东思想巨大威力之福啊！
    讲用会开得非常红火。一个个发言，一条条经验，都生动、具体地说明：“老三篇”是座右铭，是改造世界观的必修课。大家一致表示，不但自己要毕生活学活用“老三篇”，而且要在无产阶级文化大革命中更好地带头学，带头用，带动部队更广泛更深入地活学活用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处大闹革命。
