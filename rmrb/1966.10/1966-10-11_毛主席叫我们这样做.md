On the afternoon of September 18th, at half past seven, I was working underground when I suddenly received a phone call. It said that my wife had fallen ill on her way back from another place and had been sent back home, and I should hurry back. I rushed home to find my wife and child already there, along with a few young visitors who were chatting and laughing, making the scene quite lively.

What was going on? After I asked around, I found out the following: On September 16th, my wife brought the child back from her parents' home. Passing through Zhengzhou Station, she suddenly came down with acute enteritis and lay on a chair in the waiting room, in so much pain that she couldn't walk. Our two-year-old child saw his mother lying on the chair and moaning, and started crying loudly. In this situation, going to the hospital for treatment was out of the question—there wasn't much money on hand, and she couldn't go to the hospital alone. She really wished she could fly back to Henan and see her family.

My wife's condition worsened. At this point, a few Red Guards came to ask about the situation and immediately had her carried to the hospital for treatment. After admission, they stayed with her, bringing her food and drink, asking after her health, and taking good care of the child as well. My wife's condition improved quickly. When she was discharged, they paid the fees and sent her to the train. On the train, the Red Guards took even better care of her, from Zhengzhou to Tangyin, not resting for a single minute. When they reached Tangyin, my wife had to transfer trains, but she was still not fully recovered and had the child with her, so how could she manage? It was already evening, and there were no more trains from Tangyin to Henan that day, so she had to wait until the next day. Seeing this, the Red Guards, without a moment's hesitation, went to the bus station and found a bus to send my wife all the way home. By then, it was already past seven.

After I rushed home, I learned that these Red Guards had been very tired on the way. I was so moved that I didn't know what to say, and tears welled up in my eyes. I wanted to invite them to stay for a meal, but they refused. I asked for their names, but they just said, "Chairman Mao told us to do this." Saying this, they wanted to leave, and I couldn't hold them back. What could I do? I held onto them tightly and sent them all the way to the Mining Bureau Guesthouse to rest. At the guesthouse, according to the rules, they had to register their names, so they finally told me. Only then did I know they were Red Guards from the Power Engineering College in Baotou.

Young people, Red Guards of New China! I deeply thank you. You are truly worthy of learning from. But I am even more grateful to our great leader Chairman Mao, because as these young people said, they did this as Chairman Mao instructed, and it is Chairman Mao who educated and cultivated them, teaching them to serve the people wholeheartedly. I couldn't help but shout from the bottom of my heart:

Long live our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao!

### “毛主席叫我们这样做”

    “毛主席叫我们这样做”
    九月十八日下午七点半钟，我正在井下劳动，突然接到电话，说我爱人从外地回家的路上得了急病，被送回来了，叫我赶快回家去。我赶回家一看，爱人和小孩已经到了家里，还有几个年轻的客人陪伴着他们，说说笑笑，很是热闹。
    这是怎么一回事呢？我问明了情况，才知道是这样：九月十六日，我爱人带着孩子从娘家回来，经过郑州车站，忽然患了急性肠炎，躺在候车室的椅子上，疼得不能走路。两岁的孩子看到母亲躺在椅子上呻吟，也嚎啕大哭起来。在这种情况下，去医院看病吧，一来身上带的钱不多，二来自己一个人也没办法去医院。她真是恨不得一下子飞到鹤壁，见到自己的亲人。
    我爱人的病越来越严重了。这时，有几个红卫兵前来问明情况，立刻把我爱人抬到医院治疗。进院后，他们一直陪着她，端吃端喝，问寒问暖，把小孩也照顾的非常周到。我爱人的病很快就好转了。出院时，他们代付了费用，还送我爱人上了火车。在火车上，红卫兵更是无微不至地照顾，从郑州到汤阴，红卫兵一分钟也没有休息。到汤阴以后，我爱人要转车了，可是病还没有完全好，又带着小孩，怎么能行呢？这时已是傍晚，从汤阴到鹤壁当天没有火车了，只有等到明天走。那几位红卫兵看到这个情况，就不辞劳苦地到汽车站专门找了一辆汽车，把我爱人一直送到家里，这时已经七点多了。
    我赶回家里以后，知道这几个红卫兵沿路十分辛苦，我感动得不知说啥才好，禁不住流下了眼泪。我想留他们住下吃顿饭，可是他们怎么也不肯。我问他们的名字，他们只是说：“这是毛主席叫我们这样做的。”说着，他们就要走，我拉也拉不住。怎么办呢？我紧拉着他们不放，一直把他们送到矿务局招待所去休息。到了招待所，按制度规定要登记姓名，他们只好说出了名字，这时我才知道他们是包头市电力学院的红卫兵。
    年轻人，新中国的红卫兵呵！我深深地感谢你们，你们真是值得学习的榜样。但是，我更要感谢我们伟大的领袖毛主席，因为正如这些年轻人自己所说，他们是按照毛主席所说的话去做的，是毛主席培养教育了他们，使他们懂得了要全心全意为人民服务的道理。我不禁从心里高呼：
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
