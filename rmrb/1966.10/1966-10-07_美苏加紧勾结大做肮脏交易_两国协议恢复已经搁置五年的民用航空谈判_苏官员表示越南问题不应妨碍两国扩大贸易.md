The U.S. and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume civil aviation talks that had been suspended for five years. A Soviet official stated that the Vietnam issue should not hinder the expansion of trade between the two countries.

	Washington, October 5 (Xinhua) — According to reports from Washington, the recent talks between U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in New York have basically concluded a deal to establish a direct air route between Moscow and New York. This is another clear example of the two governments colluding in their schemes for a "peace talk" farce in Vietnam while also tightening their collaboration in other areas.

	According to Western news agencies, the U.S. State Department spokesman, McCloskey, announced on October 3 that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have agreed to resume talks on civil aviation, and a direct air route between Moscow and New York may be opened as early as next spring.

	The report said that the resumption of talks is one of the results of the Rusk-Gromyko meeting in New York. The civil aviation agreement between the two countries was initially signed in the summer of 1961 but was suspended in August of the same year due to the so-called "Berlin Crisis."

	McCloskey claimed that U.S. President Lyndon Johnson had stated that the U.S. war in Vietnam should not hinder efforts to reach agreements with the Soviet Union in some areas. The "main reason" for pushing forward the civil aviation talks is to prove Johnson's "sincerity" in this regard.

	It was announced that the U.S. "Pan American World Airways" will send experts to Moscow next week to discuss the civil aviation agreement with representatives of the Soviet Ministry of Civil Aviation. The two governments will also hold further discussions on this matter.

	According to another report, U.S. Democratic Senator Warren Magnuson said in Moscow on October 3 that the Soviet Union is "eager" to explore the possibility of increasing trade with the United States. Soviet officials have told him that the Vietnam issue should not hinder such trade.

	Magnuson went to the Soviet Union to clarify the Soviet Union's stance on issues such as trade, fisheries, space, and aviation.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on October 5, Washington — At a time when the U.S. and the Soviet Union are tightening their collusion and engaging in frequent transactions, the Soviet authorities took another pro-American, flattering action on October 3. According to an announcement by the U.S. State Department on October 4, the Soviet authorities have released a U.S. "Peace Corps" member who illegally entered Soviet territory.

	This American named Dawson was arrested by Soviet border guards on September 11 after illegally entering the Soviet Union from the Iran-Soviet border. Subsequently, the U.S. government conducted a series of negotiations with the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Soviet Embassy in the United States, insisting that Dawson was "innocent."

    美苏加紧勾结大做肮脏交易
    两国协议恢复已经搁置五年的民用航空谈判  苏官员表示越南问题不应妨碍两国扩大贸易
    新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克和苏联外长葛罗米柯最近在纽约进行的会谈，已经基本做成了建立莫斯科—纽约直通航线的交易，这是美苏两国政府在狼狈为奸策划越南“和谈”骗局的同时也在其他方面加紧勾结的又一明显例证。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基三日宣布，美国和苏联已经协议恢复两国关于民用航空的谈判，莫斯科—纽约直通航线有可能在明春就开辟。
    报道说，恢复谈判是腊斯克和葛罗米柯在纽约会谈的结果之一。美苏两国的民航协定是在一九六一年夏天已经草签、但在同年八月由于所谓“柏林危机”而搁置下来的。
    麦克洛斯基声称，美国总统约翰逊曾经表示，美国侵越战争不妨碍它在一些方面寻求同苏联达成协议，目前推进民航谈判的“主要理由”就是要证明约翰逊这番话的“诚意”。
    据宣布，美国“泛美航空公司”下周就将派专家去莫斯科同苏联民用航空部代表就民航协定举行会谈，两国政府还将就此作进一步讨论。
    另据报道，美国民主党参议员沃伦·马格纳森三日在莫斯科说，苏联“热心”于探索同美国增加贸易的可能性，苏联官员曾向他表示，越南问题不应当妨碍这种贸易。
    马格纳森是为了弄清苏联在贸易、渔业、宇宙空间和航空等问题上的态度而去苏联的。
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：在美苏加紧勾结、进行频繁交易的时候，苏联当局三日又采取了一个亲美、媚美的行动。据美国国务院四日宣布，苏联当局已经在三日释放了非法进入苏联国境的一名美国“和平队员”。
    这个名叫道森的美国人是因为在九月十一日从伊（朗）—苏边境非法进入苏联而被苏联边防军逮捕的。随后，美国政府向苏联外交部和苏联驻美国大使馆进行了一系列的交涉，硬说道森是“无罪的”。
