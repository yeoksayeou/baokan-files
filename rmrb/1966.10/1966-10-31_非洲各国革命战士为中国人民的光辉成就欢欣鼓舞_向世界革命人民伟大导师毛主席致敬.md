Revolutionaries from various African countries are jubilant over the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people and pay tribute to the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, representatives of nationalist organizations from various African countries have warmly praised China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests.

On the evening of the 28th, Mokone, a representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Algiers, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "The success of China's missile and nuclear weapon tests proves that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the revolutionary masses, it will produce immense and boundless material force. Similarly, it proves that once the revolutionary people fighting for national independence and freedom grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can conduct their struggle effectively until they achieve final victory."

He pointed out: "This successful test demonstrates the profound impact of the call by our beloved Comrade Lin Biao to the Chinese people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works."

He said, this successful test is not only an achievement of the Chinese people but also an achievement of the progressive people of the whole world. He said, under the guidance of the Pan-Africanist Congress, the people of Azania express their respect to the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, to Comrade Lin Biao, and to all those who participated in this test.

He said: The achievement of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao, "defeats the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to collude in nuclear monopoly," "and makes a great contribution to the defense of world peace."

On the 28th, representatives of the Patriotic Front of Congo (Brazzaville) and the Liberation Front of French Somaliland, Muhammad Dahane, separately went to the Chinese Embassy in Cairo to express their warm congratulations to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the Chinese government for the successful missile and nuclear weapon tests. Dahane said: "This successful missile and nuclear weapon test is a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a great victory for the Chinese people and the people of the world under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. It has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism."

Kibwe said: "The Congolese people, who are fighting, are very happy about the great achievements of the Chinese people. This is a new achievement of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. It powerfully strikes at the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of imperialists and revisionists."

On the 29th, representatives of the South West Africa People's Organization in Cairo, Kajimuira Wei and Moses Kajongwa, issued a statement warmly hailing China's successful missile and nuclear weapon tests, "which is another victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a brilliant achievement of the 700 million Chinese people in further strengthening China's national defense."

The statement pointed out that the Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance and under the impetus of the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world, have achieved this new victory, again giving a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.
