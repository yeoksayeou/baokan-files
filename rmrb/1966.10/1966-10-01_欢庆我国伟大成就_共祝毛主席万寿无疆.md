Premier Zhou Holds Grand Reception to Celebrate the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China

Celebrating Our Great Achievements and Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life

All the achievements of the Chinese people in the spiritual and material realms are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The Chinese people are fortunate and honored to have such a great leader. We firmly believe that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and pass it down from generation to generation, we will definitely be able to build our great motherland well and make it an ironclad fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

We must carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to the end! We must carry on the struggle against modern revisionism to the end and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the people of the world forward!

New China News Agency, October 30th: At a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is entering a new high tide and on the eve of our great motherland's National Day, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Leaders from various sectors of the Party and the state, including Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Li Xuefeng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, and Jiang Qing, attended the reception.

The grand reception was held in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. At 6 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai and leaders from various sectors, representatives of workers, peasants, ethnic minorities, and revolutionary groups from various sectors, overseas Chinese returning for a visit, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, and revolutionary fighters and other international friends from the five continents entered the reception hall one after another. When the reception began, more than 4,000 Chinese and foreign guests stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time, celebrating the glorious festival of the Chinese people. The orchestra played "We Are Marching on the Great Road."

The reception presented a scene of universal rejoicing. Representatives from various sectors of China and foreign friends, with hearts full of excitement, repeatedly raised their glasses to toast the victorious progress of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, to toast the great achievements of our socialist revolution and socialist construction, to toast the fighting unity of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and to wish the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, our great leader Chairman Mao, eternal life!

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the reception. On behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government, he extended warm congratulations to the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary Red Guards and youth, and revolutionary cadres across the country, to representatives of the revolutionary people of all nationalities, to representatives of overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, and expressed warm welcome and thanks to friends from the five continents!

Premier Zhou said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. It is proposed by Chairman Mao based on a summary of the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship and class struggle in our country and internationally. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has already demonstrated tremendous power. The whole Party and the whole country are in the midst of a high tide of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. The spiritual face of 700 million people has undergone a great change. A new situation of all-around advance is emerging.

Premier Zhou said: All the achievements of the Chinese people in the spiritual and material realms are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The Chinese people are fortunate and honored to have such a great leader. We firmly believe that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and pass it down from generation to generation, we will definitely be able to build our great motherland well and make it an ironclad fortress of the proletariat that will never change color.

When talking about the current favorable international situation, Premier Zhou said: The current international situation is favorable to the revolutionary people. The days of U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries will not be long. The days of modern revisionism are also getting worse. Premier Zhou emphasized: The Chinese people, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to spare no sacrifice and cost to resolutely support the Vietnamese people to fight to the end and drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam; to resolutely support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; to resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world.

Premier Zhou said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has extremely far-reaching significance in ensuring that our country adheres to proletarian internationalism. We must unite with all those who oppose imperialism and colonialism in the world to carry on the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to the end! We must, together with all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists in the world, carry on the struggle against modern revisionism to the end and push the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the people of the world forward!

Premier Zhou's speech was interrupted several times by enthusiastic applause from the Chinese and foreign guests in the hall.

Before the reception began, more than 350 Red Guards, holding high the "Red Guards" banner, marched in orderly ranks into the hall amid thunderous applause. They ascended the stage and stood in formation under the giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "The oppressed peoples' struggle for thorough liberation depends first on their own struggle, and only then on international aid. The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the peoples who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

A female Red Guard stepped forward to the stage, representing the Red Guards of the capital to salute all the Chinese and foreign guests! She proudly said: "The revolutionary furnace is the reddest, heroes emerge in the era of Mao Zedong! We are the little red soldiers of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, the highest commander and the greatest red commander of the Red Guards."

She said, under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and tempered in the storms of class struggle, we closely follow Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rise up with a thousand-pound hammer, and create a great uproar against the old world. We are the critics of the old world, the builders and defenders of the new world. She said, the Red Guards love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to closely unite with the revolutionary people of the world, fight shoulder to shoulder, overthrow U.S. imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow all reactionaries!

The spirited Red Guards, with hearts full of boundless love, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, sang loudly "The East Is Red," "The Song of Revolutionary Rebellion," "We Are Marching on the Great Road," and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." Their clear voices stirred up a long round of enthusiastic applause from the audience. The young fighters finally raised high the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with the greatest enthusiasm and the loudest voices, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" At this moment, the hall was filled with thunderous applause and joyous cheers.

More than 2,300 representatives of workers, peasants, and ethnic minorities from all over the country, who are active in studying the works of Chairman Mao and have created heroic achievements on various fronts, were warmly welcomed at tonight's reception. Among them are Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man" of Daqing, Jia Jincheng, representative of Dazhai Brigade, representatives of the 32111 Drilling Team, known as the "collective of proletarian revolutionary heroism," Huang Jiguang-like heroes who fought in the flames, peasant scientist Chen Yongkang, representatives of the People's Liberation Army who adhere to Mao Zedong Thought in military affairs and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's line of building the army, such as Deputy Platoon Leader Guo Xiaosi of a certain unit, and ethnic minority representatives Huang Shunyu (Korean), Xieqingeli (Mongolian), Basang (Tibetan), and Abdulla (Uyghur). At the reception, many foreign friends toasted these heroes, wishing them greater contributions in socialist revolution and socialist construction.
