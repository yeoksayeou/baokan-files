	Henan Province's rural cadres and community members are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, seizing the revolution, and promoting production. This has led to a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production across the province despite a severe drought this year. The autumn grain crops have seen a good harvest following the bumper summer wheat harvest. Cotton production has increased significantly, and oilseeds and tobacco have each increased by more than 50% compared to last year. The cocoon yield has more than doubled compared to last year. Counties such as Lankao, Yuanyang, Fengqiu, Yuanjin, and Yongcheng, which have relied on state-subsidized grain for years, have all turned around, transforming from grain-deficient counties to grain-surplus counties.

    河南省农业生产全面跃进
    河南省农村广大干部和社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，使全省在大旱之年出现了农业生产全面跃进的局面：秋季粮食作物在夏季小麦丰收的基础上又获得了好收成，棉花大幅度增产，油料和烟叶分别比去年增产五成多，柞蚕茧比去年增产一倍以上。过去年年吃国家统销粮的兰考、原阳、封丘、延津、永城等县，今年都翻了身，由缺粮县变成了余粮县。
