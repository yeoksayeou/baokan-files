	Sato Government Brazenly Sends Fleet to Intrude into Our Taiwan Activities, Fully Exposing Its Ambition to Invade China

	The Sato government of Japan, at the instigation of U.S. imperialism, has brazenly sent a fleet to intrude into our Taiwan Province, strengthening military collusion with the Chiang clique and actively serving U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war in Vietnam. This is a blatant invasion of our territorial waters and territory by the Japanese reactionary government, a serious military provocation against our country.

	According to a report from the Chiang clique's "Central News Agency," this Japanese fleet, led by Fleet Commander Mizutani Hidechika, consists of four destroyers and over 1,100 naval personnel (including more than 150 officers and cadets from the Naval Academy). It arrived in Keelung on September 29 and stayed in Taiwan for five days. On the day the Japanese fleet entered Keelung Harbor, Mizutani Hidechika openly boasted to the Chiang clique's press that the Sato government would "cooperate with the Chiang clique to make every effort to 'maintain' peace and freedom in Asia." Mizutani Hidechika and others also held secret talks with Chiang clique military leaders such as "Minister of Defense" Chiang Ching-kuo, "Director of the Joint Logistics Command" Lai Mingtang, and "Commander of the Navy" Feng Qichui. They also held a press conference, "visited" Chiang clique military facilities, and "familiarized" themselves with the routes. The newly appointed Japanese "Ambassador to Taiwan," Shimazu Hisamasa, also openly held a "reception" for this fleet's intrusion into Taiwan and invited Japanese militarists and traitors like He Yingqin to attend.

	According to Taiwanese newspapers, this is the first time since the end of World War II that a Japanese fleet has entered Taiwan. When the Japanese militarists withdrew from Taiwan in 1945, they had already shouted, "We will return!" Now, the Sato government has brazenly sent a fleet to intrude into our Taiwan Province, fully exposing the Sato government's ambition to invade China, inheriting the legacy of pre-war Japanese militarism.

	Before this, the Sato government had already been colluding militarily with the Chiang clique. In May of this year, the Sato government sent 68 Japanese "Self-Defense Force" officers to Taiwan by plane to "inspect" the U.S. military's "Gongguan Air Base" and the Chiang clique's "National Defense Research Center" and other military facilities. At the same time, Japan's "Defense Research Institute" and "Air Self-Defense Force Staff College" and other military intelligence agencies also sent personnel to Taiwan to collude militarily with the Chiang clique.

	According to reports, not long ago, the leader of the U.S. military "advisory group" in Taiwan, Johnson, crazily shouted, "The military base in Taiwan can support Vietnam, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and other neighboring countries. The U.S. military transport squadron at the Gongguan Air Base in Taiwan not only can support the war in Vietnam but can also, if necessary, fly to other regions with a single order." The Sato government's frequent dispatch of military personnel to Taiwan and collusion with the Chiang clique fully exposes the Sato government's increasing role as a docile tool of U.S. imperialism and its evil plot to become a member of the new holy alliance of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism in Asia to plot against China. Our relevant authorities are closely monitoring the Sato government's serious military provocation against our country.

    加紧勾结蒋帮为美帝效劳  充分暴露侵略中国的野心
    佐藤政府公然派舰队闯入我台湾活动
    我国有关方面正密切注视这一严重军事挑衅
    新华社四日讯　日本佐藤政府在美帝国主义唆使下，悍然派遣舰队闯入我国台湾省活动，加强与蒋帮进行军事勾结，并积极为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争效劳。这是日本反动政府对我国领海、领土明目张胆的侵犯，是对我国进行的严重军事挑衅。
    据蒋帮“中央社”的消息透露，这支日本舰队由舰队司令水谷秀澄率领，共有四艘驱逐舰，一千一百多海军人员（其中包括将校军官和海军军官学校学生一百五十多人），于九月二十九日抵达基隆。在台湾活动了五天。日本舰队闯进台湾基隆港的当天，水谷秀澄就公然对蒋帮报界叫嚷说，佐藤政府要与蒋帮“共同合作，尽最大的努力”“维护”亚洲的“和平”与“自由”。水谷秀澄等还与蒋帮“国防部长”蒋经国、“联勤总司令”赖名汤、“海军总司令”冯启聪等蒋军头目进行了密谈，并公开举行记者招待会，“参观”蒋帮的军事设施，“熟悉”航道。新上任不久的日本驻台湾“大使”岛津久大还公然为这支舰队侵台举行“酒会”，并邀请日本军国主义的忠实走狗、卖国贼何应钦等赴会。
    据台湾报纸透露，日本舰队闯入台湾活动，这是第二次世界大战结束后的第一次。日本军国主义者在一九四五年撤离台湾时，就曾经叫嚣：“我们要回来的！”现在，佐藤政府悍然派舰队闯入我国台湾活动，这就充分暴露了佐藤政府继承前日本军国主义的衣钵侵略中国的野心。
    在这之前，佐藤政府早就与蒋帮进行军事勾结。今年五月佐藤政府曾派日本“自卫队”军官六十八人乘飞机到台湾，“考察”侵台美军霸占的“公馆空军基地”，以及蒋帮的“国防研究”中心等军事设施。同时，日本“防卫研究所”和“航空自卫队干部学校”等军事情报机构，也派人到台湾同蒋帮进行军事勾结。
    另据报道，不久以前，侵台美军“顾问团”团长约翰逊曾疯狂地叫喊，“台湾的军事基地，能够支援越南、南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾等邻近国家”，“台湾的公馆空军基地的美军运输中队，不仅可以支援在越南的战争，必要时，命令一下，就可以飞往其它地区”。日本佐藤政府不断派遣军事人员到台湾活动，与蒋帮进行勾结，充分暴露了佐藤政府日益成为美帝国主义手中的驯服工具，和它一心一意想充当美帝国主义和现代修正主义在亚洲策划的反华的新神圣同盟成员的罪恶阴谋。对于佐藤政府对我国的严重军事挑衅，我国有关方面正在密切注视中。
