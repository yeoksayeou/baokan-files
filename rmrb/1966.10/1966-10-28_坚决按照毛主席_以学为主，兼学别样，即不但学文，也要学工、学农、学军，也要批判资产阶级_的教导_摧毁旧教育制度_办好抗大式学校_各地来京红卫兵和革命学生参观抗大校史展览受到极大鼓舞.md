Resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "focus on study, learn other skills, not just literature, but also industry, agriculture, military, and criticize the bourgeoisie." Destroy the old education system and establish schools in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University (抗大). Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places visiting Beijing are greatly inspired by the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, in recent days, a large number of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, with revolutionary enthusiasm, visited the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The young revolutionaries said after the visit that the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is good in every way, and ultimately it is good because it fully implements Chairman Mao's educational thoughts and educational line. They expressed their determination to thoroughly carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, destroy the old bourgeois education system, and turn our schools into revolutionary universities in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

Every day, the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition hall of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum receives tens of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students. Some carefully look at the revolutionary relics one by one; some focus on listening to the entire explanation and then copy down the instructions, inscriptions, and explanations of many exhibits by Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao. When the Red Guards and revolutionary students enter the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition hall, it is as if they have entered the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University of that time. They see precious pictures of our beloved leader Chairman Mao personally giving lectures and making reports to the students, see the students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University concentrating on studying Chairman Mao's works, harvesting bumper crops, spinning, weaving, and training intensively, ready to fight against the Japanese invaders at any time. They are extremely moved. Many Red Guards said: We have had a vivid lesson on Mao Zedong Thought here and received profound education.

Many of the revolutionary youngsters who visited the exhibition are children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. They said, before liberation, our parents could not even afford clothes and food, let alone send us to school. After liberation, the Party and Chairman Mao gave us the right to go to school, and we are eager to have schools train us to be useful to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. However, in the seventeen years since liberation, the representatives of the bourgeoisie who are anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought and who have been entrenched in the educational front have frantically sabotaged and obstructed Chairman Mao's educational line, stubbornly implemented the bourgeois revisionist educational line, and tried to turn us into successors of the bourgeoisie, to serve the restoration of capitalism. We firmly refuse! They said, we are young people living in the Mao Zedong era. We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. We will inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. After returning, we will actively participate in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, resolutely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly reform the bourgeois education system, and become strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Let the imperialists and modern revisionists' dream of peaceful evolution for the third generation of China be completely shattered!

Revolutionary students from half-work, half-study and half-farm, half-study schools, after visiting the exhibition, have a deeper understanding. They expressed that after returning to school, they will definitely inherit the fine traditions of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and carry them forward. They will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "focus on study, learn other skills, not just literature, but also industry, agriculture, military, and criticize the bourgeoisie," and further turn their schools into the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive schools in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They will temper themselves into cultured laborers who have socialist consciousness and who develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education.

Many Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students wrote passionate poems, praises, and resolutions in the guestbook after the visit. A group of Red Guards from Shandong Province wrote: "After visiting the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition, our enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has been further stimulated. We will definitely redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's works and redouble our efforts to learn knowledge and skills useful for the socialist revolution and socialist construction and the ability to serve the people. Like White, Zhang, and Old Man of the Mountain, we will devote ourselves to the revolution and to the people."

Some Red Guards from Gansu Province wrote: "After visiting the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, we have a deeper understanding that the school system must be shortened and education must be revolutionized. The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. We must carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, thoroughly smash and destroy the bourgeois education system and education methods, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in our educational front!"

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in the capital came to the Military Museum of the Chinese Revolution to visit the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University historical exhibition. Xinhua News Agency photographer.

    坚决按照毛主席“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的教导
    摧毁旧教育制度　办好抗大式学校
    各地来京红卫兵和革命学生参观抗大校史展览受到极大鼓舞
    据新华社二十七日讯  连日来，从全国各地来北京进行革命串连的广大红卫兵和革命学生，怀着革命热情，参观了闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的抗大校史展览。革命小将们参观以后说，抗大千好，万好，归根到底是一好：它完全贯彻执行了毛主席的教育思想和教育路线。他们表示，一定要彻底搞好无产阶级文化大革命，摧毁旧的资产阶级教育制度，把我们的学校办成抗大式的革命化大学。
    每天，中国人民革命军事博物馆的抗大校史展览厅，接待着成千上万的红卫兵和革命学生。他们有的仔细地把一件件革命文物看了一遍又一遍；有的集中精力听完了全部讲解之后，又从头到尾把毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志给抗大的指示、题词和很多展品的说明抄录下来。红卫兵和革命学生们走进抗大校史展览厅，就像走进了当年的抗大。他们看到敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自给学员们讲课和作报告的一幅幅珍贵的图片，看到抗大学员们聚精会神地学习毛主席著作，收割丰收的庄稼、纺纱、织布和正在紧张操练，准备随时抗击日本侵略者的生动画面，万分激动。许多红卫兵说：我们在这里上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想的课，受到了深刻的教育。
    参观展览的革命小将们，很多是工人和贫下中农子弟。他们说，解放前，我们的父母衣食都不周全，哪有钱供给我们上学呢。解放后，党和毛主席给了我们上学的权利，我们多么迫切地期望学校能把我们培养成为对社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业有用的人。可是，解放十七年来，盘踞在教育阵地上的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级代表人物，疯狂地破坏和阻挠毛主席的教育路线，顽固地执行资产阶级修正主义的教育路线，想把我们变成为资产阶级的接班人，让我们为资本主义复辟服务，我们坚决不答应！他们说，我们是生活在毛泽东时代的青年，我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，继承和发扬抗大光荣传统，回去之后，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，坚决完成一斗二批三改的任务，彻底改革资产阶级教育制度，做坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人，让帝国主义、现代修正主义对中国的第三代寄托和平演变的幻想彻底毁灭！
    来自半工半读、半农半读学校的革命学生，参观展览之后，体会更深。他们表示，回校以后一定要把抗大的优良传统继承下来，并且发扬光大，坚决按照毛主席“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的教导，进一步把他们的学校办成一个抗大式的最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，把自己锻炼成为有社会主义觉悟的，在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展的有文化的劳动者。
    许多红卫兵和革命师生参观以后，在留言簿上写下了热情奔放的诗句、赞语和决心。一批来自山东省的红卫兵写道：“看了抗大校史展览，更激发了我们活学活用毛主席著作的热情。我们一定要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，加倍努力地学习对社会主义革命、社会主义建设有用的知识和为人民服务的本领。像白求恩、张思德、老愚公那样，全心全意为革命，全心全意为人民。”
    来自甘肃省的一些红卫兵写道：“参观了抗大校史，我们愈加深刻地认识到，学制必须缩短，教育必须革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把资产阶级教育制度、教育方法彻底砸烂、捣碎，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在我们的教育阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！”（附图片）
