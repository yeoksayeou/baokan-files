	The *People's Daily* Correspondent in the Soviet Union on His Unreasonable Expulsion by the Soviet Authorities
	Condemns the Shameful Collusion Between Soviet Revisionists and the Indonesian Fascist Military Regime

	New China News Agency, October 5th: The *People's Daily*, the official organ of the Indonesian Communist Party, recently released a statement by its correspondent in Moscow, Anwar Dalma, condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's unreasonable expulsion of him from the Soviet Union in early September. Anwar Dalma's statement reads as follows:

	Since September 17, 1963, the editorial board of the *People's Daily* sent me to Moscow to work based on an agreement between the official organ of the CPSU, *Pravda*, and the official organ of the Indonesian Communist Party, the *People's Daily*. This agreement should not be understood as a form of assistance or goodwill from the CPSU side; it was based on mutual interests in bilateral relations. The signing of this agreement was a fulfillment of the CPSU's internationalist duties, while I, as a staff member of the *People's Daily*, accepted this task and had my own internationalist duties, especially to help the Indonesian people understand the Soviet Union—the first socialist country in the world founded by Lenin. This agreement was also based on the principles of equal rights and independence in the relationship between the two newspapers and the two parties. Therefore, in carrying out my duties, I always adhered to these principles, opposed any deviation from these principles, and defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the principle of proletarian internationalism.

	On the morning of September 5, 1966, I received a summons from the Press Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking me to go there at 10 AM that day. I went, and was received by Deputy Director Pyatyev and Advisor Fedorenko of the Press Department. Pyatyev then read out a decision by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accusing me of "engaging in anti-Soviet activities and maintaining active contact with a certain foreign mission hostile to the Soviet Union." Therefore, the Soviet government decided that I "must leave the Soviet Union no later than September 7, 1966." In the discussions with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CPSU Central Committee, they did not provide specific evidence for these accusations, despite my repeated requests. They refused to grant my request for an extension of time, although they were well aware that I would have difficulties arranging travel documents, as my passport had been "revoked" by the Indonesian fascist military regime.

	This incident further exposes the close cooperation between Soviet modern revisionism and the Indonesian fascist military regime. The high-pressure tactics used against me were taken precisely when Jakarta was busy arranging for the visit of the foreign minister of the fascist military regime, Malik, to the Soviet Union. During my discussions with the Soviet side, I repeatedly condemned Malik's planned visit, pointing out to them that the Soviet Union's willingness to negotiate with a representative of the fascist military regime would not be understood by Indonesian revolutionaries. The Indonesian people and the people of the world know full well that it is the Indonesian fascist military regime that has been slaughtering, torturing, persecuting, and arresting hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members, progressives, and other democrats. However, the Soviet side insisted on its position, believing it necessary to hold talks with the Indonesian fascist military regime. During a discussion with the head of the Southeast Asia section of the CPSU Central Committee's International Department, Yakovlev, on August 18, 1966, he even said that if the current Indonesian fascist military regime requested military aid from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union would consider it. The reason given for this policy is similar to the reason they gave when they began cooperating with the Indian reactionaries.

	Of course, I cannot specifically analyze their accusation that I engaged in anti-Soviet activities—the excuse they used to expel me from the Soviet Union—because they themselves cannot specifically explain this accusation. However, based on my experience of multiple discussions with Soviet government and party officials, I think they accuse me of being "anti-Soviet" because I firmly oppose imperialism and modern revisionism. This is not the first time they have said I am "anti-Soviet"; in fact, it has been this way since the publication of my first report on the Soviet Union. In September 1963, I sent out my first article from Moscow, which was after the Indonesian ambassador to the Soviet Union, Malik, instructed the cancellation of the anti-"Malaysia" demonstration originally scheduled for September 25, 1963, for Indonesian students. According to Malik himself, the demonstration was canceled at the request of the Soviet government. My faithful report on this matter was slandered as an anti-Soviet article. After the publication of another of my reports, I also faced similar accusations. That report was about the brutal suppression by Soviet military police of a demonstration by Vietnamese and other foreign students against U.S. imperialist aggression on March 4, 1965. Due to my objective report supporting the students opposing U.S. imperialism, I was again accused of writing an anti-Soviet article.

	More recently, on June 29, 1966, the baseless accusations against me reached their peak when the Press Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned me to explain a statement made by Comrade Supeno on behalf of Indonesian progressive journalists congratulating the emergency meeting of Asian and African writers held in Beijing. This statement condemned Soviet modern revisionists for their divisive activities within the Asian and African Writers' Association, and for continuing to send weapons to Indonesia after the September 30th incident, a fact announced by the Indonesian fascist military regime, which the Soviet authorities never refuted. In this conversation, which had a strong tone of intimidation, Soviet officials accused Comrade Supeno of making anti-Soviet statements, accusing him of defaming and insulting the Soviet Union. Their plot was to put pressure on me to take a different attitude, to refute Comrade Supeno's statement in writing and verbally. This divisive and slanderous tactic, of course, was met with my stern rejection. Moreover, I believe that Comrade Supeno's statement was not anti-Soviet but was against the modern revisionism of the Soviet leadership. I also encountered the same attitude during my discussions with the CPSU Central Committee on June 30 and August 18, 1966.

	During their discussions with me, they always boasted about their "support" for Indonesian communists and progressives, mentioning the parts about the Indonesian issue in the CPSU Central Committee's statements and Brezhnev's speeches. However, I personally heard them, when speaking to the public in residential areas, research institutes, and universities, whenever they talked about the current situation in Indonesia, always made slanderous accusations against Indonesian communists and those they called the "tail of Beijing" in Indonesia. They shamelessly used the temporary setbacks of the Indonesian Communist Party to oppose the Communist Party of China. When talking about the racist atrocities committed by the Indonesian fascist military regime against Indonesian Chinese, they did not consider it their primary duty to condemn this racism and to express internationalist support to the People's Republic of China as a socialist country. Instead, they actually blamed the Chinese themselves, saying that the Chinese in Indonesia were only there to make money. This statement only repeated the Indonesian fascist military regime's statements about their racist barbaric actions. Soviet newspapers, when reporting on the situation in Indonesia, did not report on the necessary resistance struggle of the Indonesian people but prominently reported the speeches of fascist military regime leaders like Malik. In their propaganda and agitation after the September 30th incident in Indonesia, their propagandists in their speeches called Nasution an anti-imperialist nationalist!

	As for their claim that I maintained contact with a certain foreign mission hostile to the Soviet Union, I can only say without hesitation that, as a correspondent for the *People's Daily*, the organ of the Indonesian Communist Party, I not only maintained contact with one but with all the embassies of socialist countries and with foreign journalists in Moscow, especially communist journalists. This relationship is absolutely above board, especially since, as a correspondent for the party organ, I must follow the policy of the Indonesian Communist Party regarding the international communist movement, which requires every member of the Indonesian Communist Party to study and elucidate the different views of each communist and workers' party on the issues of the international communist movement. The Soviet authorities themselves have never made any regulations or rules regarding the relationships between parties, nor have they explicitly prohibited contact with any embassy of any socialist country. Until I was expelled, I had never received any warnings on this matter.

	Therefore, I can conclude that the Soviet government expelled me because:

	1. I adhered to the principles of opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, defending Marxism-Leninism, and upholding the revolutionary principles of the 1957 Declaration and the 1960 Statement of the Communist and Workers' Parties, as assigned by the *People's Daily* and the Indonesian Communist Party.

	2. The Soviet authorities considered my continued stay in Moscow an obstacle to their collusion with the Indonesian fascist military regime, which has slaughtered tens of thousands of communists and innocent people.

	This incident does not harm me; on the contrary, it will further expose the true face of the Soviet modern revisionists in their relations with other parties and with the Indonesian fascist military regime. The action of the Soviet authorities is another lesson that will make all Marxist-Leninists and progressive forces around the world more deeply aware of the treacherous role of modern revisionists in obstructing the struggle of the world proletariat to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism and obstructing the struggle of the peoples of all countries for national independence. The modern revisionists—the CPSU leadership—through this action, can only clearly expose their hypocritical attitude towards the situation in Indonesia. On the one hand, they loudly proclaim their "support" for the Indonesian people who are suffering from the brutal repression of the Indonesian Nasution-Suharto fascist military regime; on the other hand, they collude with the fascist militarists and expel an Indonesian communist.

	I release this statement only to add another specific fact to the many facts already known to most of the liberation fighters in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have been widely exposed and condemned at many Asian-African and other international conferences, such as the enlarged plenary session of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and the emergency meeting of Asian-African writers. All these conferences have pointed out the dangerous nature of modern revisionism to the liberation struggles of the peoples of the world.

	Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and thanks here to the Chinese government and the All-China Journalists Association and, through them, to the Chinese people, because they are willing to welcome me to China and provide all the necessary conveniences for my statement to be known to the world public. This is another supportive action by the Chinese government, journalists, and people towards us Indonesian revolutionaries.

### 印尼共《人民日报》驻苏记者就他被苏联当局无理驱逐发表声明  谴责苏修勾结印尼法西斯军人政权的可耻行径

    印尼共《人民日报》驻苏记者就他被苏联当局无理驱逐发表声明
    谴责苏修勾结印尼法西斯军人政权的可耻行径
    新华社五日讯　印度尼西亚共产党机关报《人民日报》驻莫斯科记者安瓦尔·达尔马最近发表声明，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团今年九月初无理将他驱逐出苏联，指出苏联现代修正主义者采取的这一可耻行动，是他们同印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权互相勾结的具体证明。安瓦尔·达尔马的声明全文如下：
    从一九六三年九月十七日开始，《人民日报》编委会根据苏共官方机关报《真理报》和印度尼西亚共产党官方机关报《人民日报》之间的协议，把我派到莫斯科去工作。这项协议不应当理解为是苏共方面的一种帮助或者一种善心，它是以双方关系方面的共同利益为基础的。缔结这项协议，在苏共是履行它的国际主义义务，而在我这方面，我作为《人民日报》的一个工作人员，接受这个任务，也有我自己的国际主义义务，特别是为了使印度尼西亚人民了解苏联——列宁缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家。这一协议也是以两家报纸和两党关系方面享有平等权利和独立的原则为基础的。因此，我在执行任务时，总是坚持这些原则，反对背离这些原则的一切做法，以捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和始终不渝地坚持无产阶级国际主义的原则。
    一九六六年九月五日上午，我接到苏联外交部新闻司的召见通知，要我这一天上午十时去一次。我去了，由新闻司副司长皮亚季捷夫和顾问费多连科接见了我。皮亚季捷夫接着向我宣读了苏联外交部的一个决定，指责我“从事反苏活动并且同敌视苏联的某外国使团保持一种积极的接触”，因此，苏联政府决定我“必须在不迟于一九六六年九月七日以前立即离开苏联。”在外交部以及我同苏共中央的谈话中，他们除了说什么他们掌握事实证据以外，都不愿具体说明这些指责的意思。尽管我反复要求，他们一味拒绝拿出证据给我看。他们不愿听取我要求延长期限的意见，虽然他们清楚地知道，我在安排旅行证件方面一定有困难，因为我的护照已被印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权“吊销”了。
    这个事件只能进一步暴露苏联现代修正主义和印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权之间的亲密合作关系。这个对付我的高压手段恰恰是在雅加达正在忙于安排法西斯军人政权外交部长马利克访问苏联的时候采取的。我在同苏联方面谈话时曾经几次谴责马利克这次计划中的访问，我向他们指出，苏联愿意同法西斯军人政权的一个代表谈判的态度决不会被印尼革命者所谅解。印度尼西亚人民和全世界人民完全知道，是印尼法西斯军人政权对几十万共产党员、进步人士和其他民主人士进行屠杀、拷打、迫害和逮捕。但是苏联方面坚持自己的立场，认为有必要同印尼法西斯军人政权进行会谈。在一九六六年八月十八日同苏共中央国际部东南亚科科长雅科夫列夫会谈时，他甚至说，如果目前的印尼法西斯军人政权向苏联提出任何武器援助的要求，苏联将予以考虑。奉行这项政策的理由同他们开始同印度反动派合作时提出的理由类似。
    当然我无法具体分析他们说我进行反苏活动的指责——他们用来作为把我赶出苏联的借口，因为他们自己也不能具体地说明这一指责。但是，根据我自己同苏联政府和党的负责人士进行多次谈话后的经验，我想，他们说我“反苏”是因为我坚定地反对帝国主义和现代修正主义。这不是他们第一次说我“反苏”，而实际上是从我关于苏联的第一篇报道发表以后就这样说。我在一九六三年九月从莫斯科发出第一篇文章，那是在当时印尼驻苏联大使马利克的指示下，取消印尼留学生原定在一九六三年九月二十五日举行的反“马来西亚”示威以后。据马利克亲口对我说，取消这次示威是由于苏联政府提出了要求。我关于这件事的忠实报道就被诬蔑为一篇反苏文章。我的另一篇报道发表后我也遭到了类似的指责。我的那篇报道是关于越南和其他外国留学生在一九六五年三月四日举行反对美帝国主义侵略的示威的，这次示威遭到苏联军警的残暴镇压。由于我这篇支持反对美帝国主义的学生的客观报道，我再次受到写反苏文章的指责。
    更近一些时候，在一九六六年六月二十九日，对我的毫无根据的指责达到了顶峰，那天外交部新闻司把我召去，要我解释苏佩诺同志代表印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者发表的祝贺在北京召开的亚非作家紧急会议的声明。这一声明谴责了苏联现代修正主义者，因为他们在亚非作家组织内进行分裂活动，因为他们在九月三十日事件之后还继续运送武器给印度尼西亚，这是印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权宣布的一个事实，而苏联当局也从未驳斥过。在这次对我含有很浓厚的恫吓口气的谈话中，苏联有关官员指责苏佩诺同志发表反苏声明，指责他诽谤和侮辱苏联。他们的阴谋是要对我施加压力，要我采取不同的态度，用书面形式和在口头上对苏佩诺同志的声明进行驳斥。这种挑拨离间的分裂手法当然遭到了我的严厉的拒绝。而且我认为苏佩诺的声明没有反苏的味道，而只是在反对苏联领导集团的现代修正主义。我在一九六六年六月三十日和八月十八日同苏共中央谈话的时候也遇到了同样的态度。
    他们在同我谈话时总是吹嘘他们“声援”印尼共产党人和进步人士，提到苏共中央声明和勃列日涅夫讲话中关于印尼问题的那些地方。但是我亲耳听到，他们在住宅区、研究所和大学里向群众讲话时，只要谈到目前印尼局势，总是对印尼共产党人和他们称为北京的尾巴的印尼共进行诽谤性的指责。他们肆无忌惮地利用印尼共所受到的暂时挫折来反对中国共产党。在谈到印尼法西斯军人政权对印尼华侨所采取的种族主义暴行时，他们并不认为他们的首要义务是谴责这种种族主义并且对作为社会主义国家的中华人民共和国表示国际主义声援，相反，他们竟然声称这要怪华侨自己，因为华侨在印尼完全为了赚钱。这种说法只是重复印尼法西斯军人政权关于他们的种族主义野蛮行动的说法。苏联报纸在报道印尼局势时不是对印尼人民进行的抵抗斗争作必要的报道，却在显著地位报道像马利克这些法西斯军人政权的头子的讲话。在评论九卅事件以后的印尼局势时，他们的宣传鼓动者在讲话中把纳苏蒂安说成是反帝的民族主义者！
    至于他们所说我同敌视苏联的某个外国使馆保持接触的说法，我只能毫不犹豫地说，作为印尼共机关报《人民日报》的记者，我不仅与一个，而且同各个社会主义国家的大使馆以及同驻莫斯科的外国记者，特别是共产党记者保持接触。这种关系绝对是光明正大的，尤其是因为我作为党机关报的记者，必须奉行印尼共关于国际共产主义运动的政策，这项政策使印尼共的每一个党员需要研究阐明各个共产党和工人党对于国际共产主义运动的问题的不同观点的一切材料。苏联当局自己从未就各党之间的关系作出任何规定或守则，从未明文禁止与任何社会主义国家的任何大使馆进行任何接触。直到我被驱逐时为止，我从未接到这方面的任何警告。
    因此，我可以得出结论，苏联政府驱逐我是因为：
    一、我按照《人民日报》和印尼共为我规定的任务，坚持反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的原则，保卫马克思列宁主义，高举共产党和工人党一九五七年宣言和一九六○年声明的革命原则。
    二、苏联当局认为我继续驻在莫斯科是妨害他们与屠杀了几十万共产党人和无辜人民的印尼法西斯军人政权进行勾结的障碍之一。
    这个事件对我毫无损害，相反，它将进一步暴露苏联现代修正主义者自己在各党之间的关系上以及在他们与印尼法西斯军人政权的关系上的真面目。苏联当局的这个行动是另一个教训，它将使全世界所有的马克思列宁主义者和进步力量更深切地认识到现代修正主义者在阻挠世界无产阶级保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性的斗争和阻挠世界各国人民争取民族独立斗争方面所起的背信弃义的作用。现代修正主义者——苏共领导集团——通过他们的这个行动，只能清楚地自我暴露他们对印尼局势的伪善态度。一方面，他们大肆叫嚷“声援”受到印尼纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军人政权的残暴镇压的印尼共和印尼人民；另一方面，却与法西斯军国主义者相勾结，驱逐一名印尼共产党人。
    我发表这个声明只是为亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的大部分解放战士已清楚了解的大量事实补充又一个具体事实，这些事实是在许多亚非和其它国际会议，如亚非新闻工作者协会扩大全体会议、亚非作家紧急会议等会议上受到广泛的揭露和谴责的，所有这些会议都指出了现代修正主义对于世界人民解放斗争的危险性。
    最后，我想在这里向中国政府和中华全国新闻工作者协会并通过他们向中国人民表示最真诚的感激和谢意，因为他们愿意欢迎我到中国来，并提供一切必要的便利，使我的声明能为世界公众所知。这是中国政府、新闻工作者和人民对我们印尼革命者的又一个声援行动。
