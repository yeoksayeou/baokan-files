The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," performed by the Shanghai Revolutionary Beijing Opera Troupe, is an excellent work. It tells the story of a pursuit team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who, undaunted by sacrifices and overcoming countless difficulties, strategically captures Tiger Mountain and annihilates the bandit gang led by Seatop Tiger. The opera prominently features heroes such as Yang Zhirong and Shao Jianbo, who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, showcasing the lofty spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army serving the people wholeheartedly, and celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's people's war strategy.

In the winter of 1946, after fierce battles on the Northeast battlefield, our army achieved glorious victories. The bandit forces, which had been integrated into the Nationalist army, were defeated by our army and fled into the deep mountains and dense forests, attempting to make a last stand.

A 36-person pursuit team led by Shao Jianbo, the chief of staff of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, followed Chairman Mao's directive to "establish a solid Northeast base area." They ventured deep into the snow-covered forests, mobilized the masses, eliminated bandits, secured the rear, and supported the field army in repelling the Nationalist attacks. After occupying Niu Tou Shan, our pursuit team prepared to march on Tiger Mountain to eliminate the Seatop Tiger bandit gang.

Yang Zhirong, the reconnaissance platoon leader, and others scouted along the way and visited a hunter's family hiding in the deep mountains. With their help, they immediately tracked down and captured the bandit Tuomao, seizing a "contact map" that revealed the bandits' secret contact points. They also learned that Seatop Tiger had long wanted to obtain this map.

Due to the complex fortifications on Tiger Mountain, a frontal assault was not advisable, so a strategic approach was necessary. Yang Zhirong expressed his determination as a Communist Party member to take on the heavy responsibility and volunteered to disguise himself as the bandit Hu Biao, pretending to offer the map to infiltrate Tiger Mountain.

Before Yang Zhirong went up the mountain, Shao Jianbo repeatedly instructed him to be bold and cautious, and convened a party branch meeting to meticulously plan Yang's infiltration.

After Yang Zhirong left, the pursuit team moved into Jia Pigu. The local people, who had long suffered from banditry, were initially suspicious of our pursuit team. However, our army's strict discipline, friendly attitude, and sincere help in solving the people's problems won their support and trust through practical actions.

Yang Zhirong went up the mountain to offer the map, and Seatop Tiger was overjoyed, giving Yang important tasks. On the mountain, Yang Zhirong overcame several of Seatop Tiger's tests, gaining his trust and seizing the opportunity to send intelligence down the mountain.

The pursuit team conducted snow training in Jia Pigu and organized production and self-rescue for the local people, as well as training militia. Shao Jianbo sent people to escort the captured bandits Luan Ping and Tuomao by train back to the Mudanjiang Command Department, awaiting Na Dade's return with intelligence from Tiger Mountain to immediately advance on Tiger Mountain.

Na Dade returned with the intelligence, and the time to annihilate the bandits was approaching. At this critical moment, the small train carrying the prisoners was blown up by the bandits, and Luan Ping escaped. Shao Jianbo considered that if Luan Ping escaped to Tiger Mountain, it would ruin the entire plan to annihilate the enemy, so he ordered an immediate departure.

Luan Ping indeed escaped to Tiger Mountain. At this crucial moment, Yang Zhirong displayed great wisdom and courage, defeating Luan Ping and eliminating this stubborn bandit.

When the bandits were holding a grand "hundred-chicken banquet," the pursuit team arrived just in time, annihilating all the bandits without leaving any behind. Our army achieved a glorious victory.

    《智取威虎山》剧情简介
    上海革命京剧文工团演出的《智取威虎山》，是一出优秀的革命现代京剧。它通过我中国人民解放军一个追剿队不怕牺牲，排除万难，智取威虎山，消灭座山雕匪帮的故事，突出地塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的杨子荣、少剑波等英雄形象，展示了中国人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的崇高精神，歌颂了毛主席的人民战争思想的伟大胜利。
    一九四六年冬，我军在东北战场经过艰苦奋战取得了辉煌的胜利。国民党收编的土匪武装，被我军击溃后，逃进深山密林，妄图负隅顽抗。
    以中国人民解放军某部团参谋长少剑波为首的三十六人的追剿队，遵照毛主席“建立巩固的东北根据地”的指示，深入林海雪原，发动群众，消灭土匪，巩固后方，配合野战军，粉碎国民党的进攻。我追剿队在占领奶头山之后，又准备进军威虎山，消灭座山雕匪帮。
    我侦察排长杨子荣等人沿途侦察，访问了躲藏深山的常猎户父女。他们在常猎户父女帮助下，立即追踪捕获了匪徒一撮毛，搜出了载有土匪秘密联络点的“联络图”，并且了解到座山雕很早就想得到此图。
    由于威虎山工事复杂，不宜强攻，只能智取，杨子荣表示共产党员要挑重担子的决心，自请改扮为“土匪胡彪”，假借献图，打入威虎山。
    在杨子荣进山之前，少剑波谆谆嘱咐他要胆大心细，并召开党支委会，为杨子荣的进山作了缜密的部署。
    杨子荣走后，追剿队进驻夹皮沟，当地人民久受匪患，不明真相，开始时对我追剿队产生怀疑。我军纪律严明，态度和蔼，热心帮助群众，解决群众各种困难，以实际行动取得了人民的拥护和支持。
    杨子荣上山献图，座山雕大喜，给杨以重任。在山上，杨子荣战胜了座山雕的几次试探，取得信任，并趁机下山送出情报。
    追剿队在夹皮沟进行雪地练兵，并为当地群众组织生产自救和训练民兵。少剑波派人把在押的土匪栾平、一撮毛用火车押回牡丹江司令部，专等前往威虎山下取杨子荣情报的孙达得回来，立即进兵威虎山。
    孙达得取回情报，距约定歼灭土匪的时刻已经迫近。这时，押运犯人的小火车被土匪炸毁，栾平逃走。少剑波考虑到栾平若逃往威虎山，将破坏整个歼敌大计，便下令紧急出发。
    栾平果然逃到威虎山。在这生死成败关头，杨子荣发挥了革命战士的大智大勇，战胜了栾平，并把这个顽匪置于死地。
    在匪徒大张“百鸡宴”的时刻，追剿队及时赶到，全歼众匪，无一漏网。我军取得了辉煌胜利。
