	The speech of Xie Shijiao, a heroine of the armed forces of the liberation of South Vietnam, at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing.

	Respected Chairman Mao:
	Respected leaders of the Party and the State,
	Comrades and Friends:

	Today, I am able to participate in the grand celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and feel greatly encouraged. Please allow me to extend the warmest greetings of solidarity and struggle from the 14 million people of South Vietnam and the armed forces of liberation to all the comrades and friends present today, and to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Over the past 17 years, the fraternal Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, have highly developed the spirit of self-reliance, bravely overcome all difficulties, and built a powerful socialist China with modern industry, agriculture, national defense, and advanced science and technology. We, the people of South Vietnam, are immensely pleased with the great achievements made by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We sincerely wish the fraternal Chinese people greater success in building their great motherland.

	Comrades and Friends:

	The Vietnamese people are now facing the most barbaric war of aggression in history. In South Vietnam, American imperialism has almost used all kinds of weapons to kill patriots and destroy the property of the people. Faced with the destruction of our country and homes, the only way for the people of South Vietnam is to wipe away our tears, clean the blood from our bodies, take up our guns, and resolutely defeat the American aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and reunify the country. In response to the call of Chairman Hu and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam pledge that no matter how many years we have to fight—five, ten, twenty, or even more—no matter how many hardships and sacrifices we have to endure, we will definitely defeat the American aggressors and drive them out of our country.

	The people and soldiers of South Vietnam, filled with hatred and anger, have risen up to defeat American imperialism's "special warfare" and have defeated the American aggressors, who were the advance troops of a partial war, in the just-concluded dry season. Now, the people and soldiers of South Vietnam are launching continuous attacks on the enemy on all fronts, both militarily and politically, putting the enemy in a state of extreme distress. The people and soldiers of North Vietnam have also shot down 1,460 American aggressor planes, making a significant contribution to the common victory of the Vietnamese people.

	American imperialism is invading Vietnam and crazily expanding this war of aggression. As long as American imperialism does not abandon its policy of invading our territory and does not withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, we will never lay down our weapons. Our stance is very clear: the fighting will of our people will not be shaken by any violence or trickery of American imperialism.

	Comrades and Friends:

	In our struggle against American aggression for national salvation, the people of South Vietnam have received the resolute, immense, and effective sympathy and support of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's statement of August 29, 1963, clearly determined the ironclad stance of supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression until complete victory. At this moment, let us express our sincere thanks to the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Chinese Communist Party led by the respected Chairman Mao. At the same time, allow us to express our sincere thanks to the socialist countries, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peace-loving people of the world who have strongly supported the just and victorious struggle of the Vietnamese people.

	We firmly believe that under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with the spirit of unity and struggle of the people of South and North Vietnam, and with the sympathy and support of the peoples of socialist countries and the world, the people of South Vietnam will definitely achieve the final victory, and Vietnam will certainly achieve true unity, independence, and freedom.

	Victory to the Vietnamese people!
	Defeat to American imperialism!
	Long live the unity and friendship of struggle between the peoples of Vietnam and China!

    向中国人民致最热烈的团结战斗敬礼
    越南南方解放武装力量女英雄谢氏娇的讲话
    新华社一日讯　越南南方解放武装力量女英雄谢氏娇在北京庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：敬爱的党和国家的各位领导，同志们，朋友们：
    今天我能够参加庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年的隆重的大会，感到欢欣鼓舞。请允许我向今天到会的各位和朋友们，向中国人民和中国人民解放军，致以越南南方一千四百万人民和解放武装力量的最热烈的战斗团结的敬礼。
    十七年来，兄弟的中国人民在以毛主席为首的中国政府和中国共产党的领导下，高度发扬了自力更生的精神，勇敢地克服了一切困难，建立起一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和先进科学技术的强大的社会主义中国。我们越南南方人民，对中国人民和中国人民解放军所取得的这些巨大的成就，感到无比高兴。敬祝兄弟的中国人民在建设自己伟大祖国的事业中取得更多的成就。
    各位，朋友们：
    越南民族正在对付一场历史上最野蛮的侵略战争。在越南南方，美帝国主义几乎用尽一切杀人的武器，大肆屠杀爱国者，毁光、烧光人民财产。面对国破家亡的情景，我们越南南方人民唯一的办法就是擦干眼泪，揩净身上的血迹，拿起枪杆，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。为响应胡主席和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团的号召，我们越南南方人民宣誓，不管要打五年、十年、二十年或更长的时间，不论要忍受多少艰苦和牺牲，我们决心战胜美国强盗，直到把侵略者一个不剩地赶出我们的国土为止。
    充满仇恨的怒火的越南南方军民，奋起打败了美帝国主义的“特种战争”，并在刚刚过去的旱季中战胜了作为局部战争先遣部队的美国侵略军。现在，越南南方军民正在各个战场上，在武装和政治两条战线上向敌人发动连续的进攻，使敌人陷于万分困窘的境地。越南北方军民也已击落美国强盗的飞机一千四百六十架，为越南民族的共同胜利作出应有的贡献。
    美帝国主义侵略越南并疯狂地扩大这一侵略战争。美帝国主义一天不愿意放弃侵略我国领土的政策，不愿意将其军队撤出越南南方，我们就决不放下手中的武器。我们的这种立场是极其明确的，我们人民的战斗意志决不是美帝国主义的任何一种暴力或者任何一种阴谋诡计所能动摇得了的。
    各位，朋友们：
    越南南方人民在自己的抗美救国斗争中，得到了以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的坚决的、无比巨大的和有效的同情与支持。毛主席一九六三年八月二十九日发表的声明，明确地确定了支持越南人民抗美救国一直达到完全的胜利的钢铁般的立场。趁这个时候，请让我们在这里表示越南南方人民和解放武装力量对以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党的真诚感谢。同时也请允许我们对大力支持越南人民进行的正义的、必胜的斗争的社会主义国家，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民以及世界爱好和平的人民表示真诚的感谢。
    我们坚信，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导之下，凭着越南南方和北方人民团结战斗的精神，又得到社会主义各国人民和全世界人民的同情和支持，越南南方人民一定赢得最后胜利，越南必将实现真正的统一、独立和自由。
    越南人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
    越中两国人民的团结战斗友谊万岁！
