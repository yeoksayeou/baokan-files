Black Dragon River Province, a renowned potato (Irish potato) producing area in China, has once again achieved a bumper harvest this year. Due to the expansion of potato planting area, the total potato production has exceeded that of the relatively good harvest year of 1964. Currently, community members are actively delivering potatoes to the state, supporting national construction. According to recent statistics, the amount of potatoes purchased in various places has already surpassed the total amount purchased last year, with a portion of them already being sent as high-quality seeds to eighteen provinces and municipalities, including Shanxi and Beijing.

After achieving consecutive increases in production for three years, the sugar beets in Black Dragon River Province have increased by more than ten percent this year compared to last year. Currently, counties such as Zhaodong, Yian, and Hulun are transporting the newly harvested sugar beets to purchasing stations and sugar factories.

    黑龙江省土豆和甜菜增产
    我国著名的土豆（马铃薯）产地黑龙江省，今年又获丰收。由于扩大了土豆种植面积，土豆总产量超过收成较好的一九六四年。目前，社员们正积极向国家交售土豆，支援国家建设。据最近统计，各地收购的土豆已超过了去年全年收购总数，其中一部分已作为良种运往山西、北京等十八个省、市。
    黑龙江省的甜菜在获得连续三年增产之后，今年又比去年增产一成以上。目前，肇东、依安、呼兰等县，正把新收的甜菜运往收购站和制糖厂。
