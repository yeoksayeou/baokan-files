The heroes of the 3211 Heroic Drilling Team are truly good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and good children of the people. They have hearts of red, loyal to the Party, and they dedicate themselves entirely to the people. To protect the state's property and the people's interests, they dare to venture into fires and climb mountains of knives. Their minds are filled with thoughts of the people, not themselves. They are the kind of people Chairman Mao spoke of—people of noble character, pure and moral, free from vulgar interests, and beneficial to the people. They are a heroic collective, a collective of heroes.

In our revolution and construction, we should all be like the 3211 Heroic Drilling Team, making the study of Chairman Mao's works the first and foremost task in life, a lifelong mission. We must turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul. We must be ready to sacrifice our heads and shed our blood, but never abandon Mao Zedong Thought. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words at all times, in all places, and in all matters, and consciously carry out Chairman Mao's highest directives. We must consider revolutionary interests as our first and foremost life, and be willing to sacrifice our lives rather than let revolutionary interests suffer any loss.

Although I am over seventy years old, I have made up my mind that as long as I am still breathing, I will dedicate myself entirely to serving the people. I will do as Chairman Mao says.

    英雄的集体  集体的英雄
    三二一一一英雄钻井队的英雄们不愧是毛主席的好学生、好战士，人民的好儿女。他们颗颗红心忠于党，全心全意为人民，为了保卫国家财产，保卫人民利益，火海敢闯，刀山敢上。他们心里想的只有人民，没有自己。他们是毛主席讲的那种高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。他们是英雄的集体，集体的英雄。
    我们闹革命、搞建设，都应该像三二一一一英雄钻井队那样，把读毛主席的书当作生活中的第一件大事，作为一辈子的战斗任务，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想永不丢，要时时、处处、事事听毛主席的话，自觉地贯彻执行毛主席的最高指示，把革命的利益当成自己的第一生命，宁可牺牲自己的生命也不让革命利益受到损失。
    我虽然七十多岁了，但是我仍下定决心，只要没有停止呼吸，就要全心全意为人民服务。毛主席怎样说，我就怎样做。
    全国人民代表大会代表  黄继光烈士的母亲  邓芳芝
