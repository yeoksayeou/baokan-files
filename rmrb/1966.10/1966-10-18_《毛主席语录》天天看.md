	Read Chairman Mao's Quotations every day,
	The heart feels especially broad,
	The motherland and the world in the heart,
	Big principles govern small principles.

	Read Chairman Mao's Quotations every day,
	The heart is like a clear mirror, seeing far,
	On the path of progress, knowing the direction,
	The enemy's tricks can be seen through.

	Read Chairman Mao's Quotations every day,
	Understanding for whom to till the land,
	Every hoe and spade for the revolution,
	Increase grain and cotton, sweat more.

	Read Chairman Mao's Quotations every day,
	Revolutionary will is as firm as steel,
	Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death,
	Transform the world, always move forward.

    《毛主席语录》天天看
    河北束鹿县西小王公社　刘源海
    毛主席语录天天看，
    心里就觉格外宽，
    祖国、世界装心内，
    大道理把小道理管。
    毛主席语录天天看，
    心如明镜看得远，
    前进路上知方向，
    敌人诡计能看穿。
    毛主席语录天天看，
    懂得为谁来种田，
    一锄一锨为革命，
    增产粮棉多流汗。
    毛主席语录天天看，
    革命意志钢铁坚，
    不怕苦来不怕死，
    改造世界永向前。
