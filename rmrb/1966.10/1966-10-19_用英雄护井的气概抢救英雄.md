The brave members of the 32111 Hero Drilling Team were injured, and people, with the deepest class sentiments and the swiftest actions, spared no effort to rescue the heroes of the people.

Not a minute could be delayed, not a second could be wasted. A massive, tense battle began!

Acting Consciously According to Chairman Mao's Instructions

The first to know the news was Liu Fanqing, a telephone operator at the county postal service, and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. As soon as she heard the call from the 32111 Drilling Team to the mine command center, her heart was filled with anxiety, as if a fire was burning her own body. The phone line from the well site to the command center was unclear, so she took the initiative to relay the message, ensuring that the situation of the injured was quickly conveyed to the command center. She thought: Is this all I can do? The injured class brothers urgently need rescue, and all relevant units must be notified as quickly as possible to save the injured. We must resolutely do as Chairman Mao teaches: completely and thoroughly serve the people. Thus, she alone operated five telephone sets, making 102 long-distance calls in the middle of the night, proactively notifying the hospital, pharmacy, car fleet, and ferry, asking them to be ready immediately to rescue the injured.

After the county committee received the urgent call, they immediately notified the relevant units to spare no effort in rescuing the injured!

The county committee's call to the transportation department received the reply: The cars are ready and can depart at any time!

The call to the ferry received the reply: The boats have set sail for the opposite shore, and the injured will be transported as soon as they arrive.

The call to the hospital received the reply: The rescue team will depart immediately.

The sub-bureau, provincial committee, and central bureau quickly received the urgent call, and the vast region suddenly stirred in the dead of night. A series of emergency meetings were held in the shortest time possible. Then, batches of workers took action, ships advanced through the rapids, cars crossed mountains, and people, with boundless concern for Chairman Mao's soldiers, rushed from all directions to the county hospital to receive the injured....

The mine command center called Beijing. The relevant leadership in the capital, representing the great leader Chairman Mao, showed concern for the heroes and made urgent arrangements. The Petroleum Ministry immediately contacted the relevant departments. The Ministry of Health prepared the medicine. The Civil Aviation Administration's planes took off from Beijing Airport....

Bringing Chairman Mao's Concern to the Heroes

The plane encountered thunderstorms and heavy rain en route, with strong low-pressure currents buffeting the aircraft, making the flight extremely difficult. But the pilots said: "For the sake of our class brothers, we must fly to the destination, and no obstacles can stop us!" They skillfully navigated around the storm and finally landed safely at the designated location on time.

This airport was still hundreds of kilometers away from where the injured were located. At this time, another plane had already been prepared for a relay flight. But it was still night, and this route had no navigation equipment. Should they take off or not? The Civil Aviation Administration decided: Take off! The pilots, Wang Huiming and several others, said: "Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, flying in the sky relies on Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought, we can overcome any difficulty."

When they flew over the destination, two long rows of lights had already been lit up on the ground. After the plane landed, they found: The local people had brought over 200 lanterns to guide the plane, deeply moved by the people's creative spirit.

The long-distance medicine delivery ship sailed without stopping, at twice the usual speed, swiftly advancing through the rolling waves and rapids, arriving before the scheduled time.

The county hospital did not have an electronic stabilizer, making blood tests inaccurate. A call was immediately made to a certain city's hardware and electrical company to buy one, but they were sold out. The company's comrades, upon hearing that it was for rescuing the heroes, sent their own electronic stabilizer, which they were using, to the hospital by a dedicated person.

The severely injured Yan Shurong was in great pain, lying on the bed all the time. He urgently needed a special sponge mattress. As soon as this news reached Tianjin, the relevant units quickly sent one.

The injured needed honeysuckle, but the local pharmacy happened to be out of this herb. The pharmacy workers, who were eating, put down their bowls, ran to a mountain ten miles away, collected more than ten pounds, and personally delivered it to the hospital. They said: "Contributing to the rescue of our class brothers is our greatest honor."

Everyone Loves Chairman Mao's Good Soldiers

Not long after the injured arrived at the hospital, a long line of people had already formed to donate blood for the heroes. They said: "The heroes need as much blood as we can give." At the hospital's laboratory door, they eagerly volunteered:

"I am a petroleum worker, draw my blood first!"
"I am young and strong, I should donate blood first!"
"I came from a distant village, draw my blood first!"

Some workers' family members, more than a hundred miles away, also gathered spontaneously in front of the mine leadership's office, demanding to donate blood. The leadership did not approve their request, and they refused to leave.

On the blood donation operating table, the doctors could not send away those who had already donated blood. Young worker Xiao Daishu had donated 200 milliliters, but she lay in bed and refused to get up, pulling the doctor and saying: "Every drop of blood is a bit of strength, I'll donate more!"

Treating burns requires "antibody blood." This type of blood can only be found in people who have been burned. But where to find it?

A farmer, covered in sweat, arrived. He said: "I am Xiao Junsheng, I have been burned before, and I am here specifically to donate blood."

Xiao Junsheng's family has been servants for three generations, living in a remote mountain village. Last year, his house caught fire, and he was burned. At that time, the party and the government gave him the greatest help and care, sending him to the hospital and helping him repair his house. This time, as soon as he heard the news of the petroleum soldiers being injured, he immediately told his family: "After I was burned, it was the party and Chairman Mao who saved me. Now, Chairman Mao's petroleum soldiers are injured, and it is time for me to contribute." With a heart full of respect for the people's heroes, he climbed over one mountain after another, took a wooden boat for dozens of miles, and transferred two more times before arriving at the hospital, donating 300 milliliters of "antibody blood."

Treating with Revolutionary Spirit

More than a hundred medical staff, entrusted by the party and the people to rescue the heroic injured, arrived at the scene. They did not ask about food, did not ask about accommodation, and did not care about travel fatigue, immediately starting to rescue the injured. They said: "We must take White as an example, with the spirit of protecting the well, rescue the heroes!"

Party member and surgeon Yang Zongcheng suffers from spinal inflammation and finds it difficult to bend over. However, when the injured's condition worsened and a large-area skin graft surgery was necessary, he took the heroes who fought in the fire as an example, standing in the operating room in the scorching June heat for several hours.

Nurse Long Yulan saw the injured heroes and was so anxious that she could not eat or sleep for days. She said: "I wish I could take all their injuries onto myself." Once, she took care of the injured for more than 30 hours straight, forgetting to feed her own baby. The injured, Qia Shuishui, had both hands burned and could not lie flat, and hanging them up caused pain, making it impossible to sleep at night. Long Yulan, along with Wang Shaogun and Jia Guirong, took turns holding the injured's hands with their own, often staying still for several hours to reduce the injured's pain. They said: "As long as the injured can sleep an extra hour, it is our greatest joy."

At night, the sound of frogs in the pond outside the ward woke the injured. The on-duty doctors, Lu Quanyi and Pan Zude, took flashlights and, in the drizzling rain, went to the pond to catch frogs until they no longer heard the frogs' croaking before leaving.

In this hospital, everywhere was filled with selfless revolutionary spirit and class sentiment. The injured said with emotion: "The medical staff treat diseases with Mao Zedong Thought, making us deeply feel that the hospital is also a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must recover here, temper our thoughts, and contribute everything to the socialist construction of our motherland."

### 用英雄护井的气概抢救英雄

    用英雄护井的气概抢救英雄
    32111英雄钻井队的勇士们受伤后，人们以最深厚的阶级感情，最迅速的行动，全力抢救人民的英雄。
    一分钟也不能推延，一秒钟也不能迟误，一个规模巨大的、紧张万分的战斗开始了！……
    自觉地按照毛主席的指示办事
    最先知道消息的，是县邮电局十八号话务员、学习毛主席著作积极分子刘范青。她一听到32111钻井队打给矿区指挥部的电话，心里万分焦急，好像大火烧在自己身上一样。从井场到指挥部的电话听不清楚，她就主动传话，使伤员的情况最迅速地传到指挥部。她想：这样，我就算完成任务了吗？受伤的阶级兄弟急需抢救，必须尽快地通知一切有关单位，抢救伤员。要坚决做到毛主席所教导的那样：完全、彻底地为人民服务。于是，她一个人操纵着五部电话机，半夜间一连接了一百零二次长途电话，主动地通知了医院、药店、汽车队、渡口，要他们立即做好准备，抢救伤员。
    县委接到告急的电话以后，立即通知有关单位，全力抢救！
    县委的电话打到运输部门，那里回答：汽车已经准备停当，随时可以出发！
    电话打到渡口，那里答道：船只已经驶向对岸，伤员一到，马上运送过来。
    电话打到医院，那里说：抢救队马上出发。
    地委、省委、中央局也很快接到了告急的电话，广大地区在深夜里突然沸腾起来。一系列的紧急会议在最短时间内召开了。接着，一批批的工作人员行动起来，轮船在激流中前进，汽车翻过重重的山岭，人们带着对毛主席的战士的无限关怀，从四面八方向接受伤员的县医院赶来。……
    矿区指挥部电话打到北京。首都有关领导机关，代表伟大领袖毛主席对于英雄们的亲切关怀，紧急进行部署。石油部立刻同有关部门联系。卫生部准备了药品。民航局飞机迅速地从北京机场上起飞。……
        把毛主席的关怀带给英雄
    飞机在途中遇到了响雷暴雨，低压气流强烈地冲击着机体，飞行十分艰难。但是，飞行员们说：“为了阶级弟兄，一定要飞到目的地，任何阻力也挡不住我们！”他们机智地绕过雷雨，终于在预定时间内在指定的地点安全降落。
    这一架飞机降落的机场，离伤员所在的地方还有几百公里。这时，另一架飞机早就作好了准备，等待接力飞行。但是，这时还是夜间，而这条航线又没有导航设备。是起飞呢，还是不起飞呢？民航局毅然决定：起飞！担当这一飞行任务的王惠明和其他几位飞行员说：“大海航行靠舵手，空中飞行靠的是毛泽东思想。只要有了毛泽东思想，什么困难也能克服。”
    当他们飞临目的地上空的时候，两行长长的灯光已经明晃晃地点燃在大地上了。飞机降落以后，他们发现：当地群众提着二百多盏马灯为飞机导航，他们深深为群众这种创造精神所感动。
    长途送药的轮船，沿途不停不靠，以比平常快一倍的航速，在波涛滚滚的急流中快速前进，还不到预定的时间就到达了。
    县医院没有电子稳压器，化验血液不准确。立即打电话到某城市五金交电公司去买，已经卖光了。这个公司的同志，一听说是为了抢救英雄，就把自己正在使用的电子稳压器，派专人送到医院。
    重伤员冉树荣每时每刻都在床上趴着，十分痛苦，很需要一个特制的海绵床垫。这个消息一传到天津，有关单位很快就送来了。
    伤员急需金银花，当地中药店里恰恰缺少这种药材。正在吃饭的中药店职工，搁下饭碗，跑到十几里外的山上，采集了十多斤，亲自送到医院。他们说：“我们为抢救阶级兄弟出点力，是最大的光荣。”
    人人热爱毛主席的好战士
    伤员到医院没有多久，前来为英雄输血的人群，已经排成了长长的行列。他们说：“英雄们要多少血，我们献多少血。”在医院的化验室门口，他们争先恐后地提出要求：
    “我是石油工人，先抽我的血！”
    “我年轻力壮，我得先献血！”
    “我是从老远的乡下跑来的，先献我的血！”
    有些远在一百多里外的职工家属，也自动地在矿区领导机关门前集合起来，要求输血。领导不批准她们的要求，坚决不走。
    在输血的手术台上，医生没有办法把那些献过血的同志打发走。青年女工萧代书已经献出了二百毫升，但她躺在床上硬不起来，拉着医生说：“一滴血就是一分力量，我再多献一些！”
    治疗烧伤最需要的是“抗体血”。这种血，只有被烧伤过的人身上才有。但是到哪里去找呢？
    一个跑得满身大汗的农民来了。他说：“我叫萧俊生，我被烧伤过，是专门来献血的。”
    萧俊生祖辈三代当长工，住在一个很远的偏僻山村里。去年他家失火，自己被烧伤。当时，党和政府给了他最大的帮助和关怀，把他送进了医院，帮他修好了房屋。这一次，他一听到石油战士光荣负伤的消息，马上对家里的人说：“我被烧伤后，是党和毛主席救了我。如今，毛主席的石油战士受了伤，正是我应该出力的时候。”他带着对人民英雄崇敬的心情，爬过一山又一山，坐了几十里路的木船，又转了两次汽车，赶到了医院，献出了三百毫升“抗体血”。
    用革命精神治病
    受党和人民委托抢救英雄伤员的一百多个医务人员一到现场，一不问吃，二不问住，三不顾旅途疲劳，立即抢救伤员。他们说：“我们要以白求恩作榜样，用英雄护井的气概抢救英雄！”
    共产党员、外科医生杨宗诚，患有脊椎炎病，弯腰都很困难。但是，当伤员病情恶化，必须作大面积的植皮手术时，他以血战火海的英雄为榜样，在酷热的六月，站在手术台前连续工作了几个小时。
    护士龙玉兰看到了受伤的英雄们，急得几天几夜吃不好，睡不好。她说：“我恨不得把他们的伤全部移到我身上来。”一次，她连续三十多个小时照顾伤员，竟忘记了给自己的婴儿喂奶。伤员查水海两手烧伤，不能平放，吊起来又痛，夜里不能安眠。龙玉兰就和王绍群、贾桂容等轮流用自己的双手托着伤员的手，经常坚持几个小时不动，减轻伤员的痛苦。她们说：“只要能使伤员多睡一个小时，就是自己最大的快乐。”
    夜里，病房外的池塘里响起了咯咯的蛙声，把伤员吵醒了。值班的医生卢泉毅、潘祖德拿起手电筒，冒着蒙蒙细雨，到池塘边去捉青蛙，直到听不到青蛙的叫声才离开。
    在这所医院里，处处充满忘我的革命精神，处处充满着阶级感情。伤员们感动地说：“医护人员用毛泽东思想治病，使我们深深感到医院也是毛泽东思想的大学校。我们一定要在这里把伤养好，把思想炼红，为祖国的社会主义建设，贡献自己的一切。”
