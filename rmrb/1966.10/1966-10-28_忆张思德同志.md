Every time I read Chairman Mao's work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I think of my old platoon leader, Comrade Zhang Side. Comrade Zhang Side has been gone for twenty-two years, but he has always been in my heart. His great communist spirit has always inspired me to press forward bravely.

I fought alongside Comrade Zhang Side for five years. In the spring of 1940, the higher-ups transferred me from the Fourth Company of the Central Military Commission's Security Regiment to work in the Communication Platoon of the regiment headquarters. The political instructor, Comrade Chun Jie, introduced me, saying, "Your platoon leader, Zhang Side, is a comrade who has experienced the Long March. You should learn from him." The instructor led me to the platoon, and I met Comrade Zhang Side for the first time. He was of medium height, although he had been injured, he was still very healthy, with a dark red face and particularly spirited eyes. He wore a faded gray cotton uniform and old straw shoes, though worn, they were very neat and clean. Upon meeting him, I was deeply impressed by his simplicity and sincerity. He smiled and said, "I am Zhang Side, from Yilong County, Sichuan. Our platoon members come from various provinces. In the future, we should follow the instructions of our superiors and unite to jointly bear the glorious task of protecting the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao."

Later, I learned that Comrade Zhang Side was born into a poor peasant family. His family had no house and no land, relying on his father and brothers to carry out long-term work and do odd jobs to make a living. At the age of twelve, he began to cut grass, herd cattle, carry water, and sweep the courtyard for the landlord, enduring endless hardships. In 1933, at the age of seventeen, he joined the Red Army and soon joined the Communist Youth League, and later the Communist Party of China. He was very brave and clever in battle. Once, in a battle, he single-handedly captured two enemy machine guns, ensuring the victory of the entire battle. He participated in the Long March, crossing snow-capped mountains and grasslands, enduring countless hardships. However, no matter how harsh the environment or how fierce the struggle, he remained steadfast and optimistic.

After I joined the Communication Platoon, the leadership appointed me as the deputy platoon leader, and I was very afraid of not doing a good job. One evening, Comrade Zhang Side called me out and found a place to sit in front of the cave. He warmly talked to me, introducing the thoughts and work situation of each comrade in the platoon, and telling me how to lead a platoon, encouraging me to strive to be a good deputy platoon leader. He said, "Our responsibility is to lead all the comrades in the platoon well. This is a glorious task given to us by the Party. To complete this task, we two must lead by example and take the initiative in doing dirty and hard work. We must not fear hardship." He shared his personal experiences with me, telling me to cherish the comrades: "During the Long March, whenever there was something to eat, the leaders always gave it to the comrades, and the comrades gave it to the leaders. Why did we care for each other like this? Because we are the people's army led by the Communist Party, and we are all class brothers fighting for a common goal. For example, between you and me, I am from Sichuan and you are from Shanxi, thousands of miles apart. If we had not joined the army, we would never have met in our dreams. Now, for a common goal, we are fighting together, which makes us closer than brothers. All our comrades should cherish each other in the same way." Comrade Zhang Side's words gave me great encouragement and enlightenment. I felt confident, with such a platoon leader encouraging and helping me, how could the work not be done well?

Soon after I joined Comrade Zhang Side's platoon, the Nationalist reactionary army, which had already surrounded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, planned to harass Yan'an. One night in the early summer of 1940, the troops were urgently assembled and set out for the front line.

During the forced march, Comrade Zhang Side cared for every comrade, sometimes helping one comrade carry his gun, sometimes helping another carry his bag of dry rations. When crossing a river without a bridge, a comrade's foot was rubbed raw, and Comrade Zhang Side, fearing the comrade would feel pain from the water, carried him across the river.

By noon, we arrived at our destination, Maozhuangzi. Maozhuangzi is a small town, about fifty miles from Yan'an, an important pass to the northeast of Yan'an. As soon as we arrived, Comrade Zhang Side put down his gun and bag and rushed to fetch water for the comrades to wash their faces. Then he picked up a broom and swept the cave. After the platoon's affairs were settled, he went to help the kitchen boil water and cook. In a short time, I realized that Comrade Zhang Side was a person who could not rest when working for the collective.

After lunch, a platoon meeting was immediately held. Comrade Zhang Side conveyed the orders from the superiors, asking us to be prepared for battle here and annihilate the daring Nationalist reactionary army that attempted to invade Yan'an. Upon hearing that the Nationalist reactionary army was about to invade Yan'an, everyone was very angry, and everyone was eager to give the enemy a fatal blow. I remember Comrade Zhang Side saying to us, "The Nationalist reactionary army is about to invade Yan'an, and we will give them a fierce counterattack here. No matter how many come, we will annihilate them all and will not let them advance one step! We must resolutely defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." Comrade Zhang Side also jokingly said, "This time the enemy has brought weapons to our doorstep, and we must accept them and supplement them well." Everyone laughed heartily.

Maozhuangzi is located in a valley between two high mountains, with the Yanhe River in the middle. In the afternoon, we went up the mountain to build fortifications. The mountain slope was covered with reeds and wild grass, and the ground was full of sticky clay and pebbles, making it very difficult to dig with a shovel. However, with the determination to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, these difficulties were nothing. Every day, as soon as we went up the mountain, we dug with all our might, and no one was willing to rest. The progress was very fast. Comrade Zhang Side dug faster than anyone else. After finishing his own fortification, he did not rest even though his hands were blistered. Instead, he helped others dig. While digging, he reminded us not to damage the crops. After work, he also picked up some firewood along the way and brought it to the kitchen. In a few days, we had built many fortifications on the high mountains and roads of Maozhuangzi.

Next, we closely watched the enemy's movements and began intensive training. At that time, each of us had a Type 38 rifle or a homemade hook rifle, a big knife, and three hand grenades. Every day, we practiced chopping, stabbing, throwing, and shooting. In the early summer of Shaanxi, the mornings and evenings were still cool, but as soon as the sun was high, it became scorching hot. Under Comrade Zhang Side's leadership, we did not care about these things and only focused on practicing our combat skills according to the regulations of the superiors, sweating profusely and not stopping. Comrade Zhang Side not only practiced hard and set an example but also led the training seriously and meticulously. If a comrade's "at ease" posture was not correct, he would not let it go. He always patiently explained the reasons and demonstrated the correct posture. If a new comrade could not close his left eye while aiming, he would tell him to cover his left eye with a piece of tree leaf and encourage him, saying, "Go back and practice, and gradually you will get used to it and be able to close your left eye." At night, Comrade Zhang Side often led us to practice seriously, always reminding us to practice with the determination to defend the Party Central Committee and with the awareness of the enemy. He also shared his combat experience, such as how to do a good job of camouflage and hide oneself, with us at any time.

Comrade Zhang Side, as the platoon leader, always led the way. He took great care of his weapons, wiping them whenever he had the chance. Under his influence, our entire platoon kept the guns in good condition.

Because we were well prepared, the Nationalist reactionary army did not dare to advance to Maozhuangzi and retreated like a turtle. Soon, we returned to Yan'an in victory.

In July 1940, the higher-ups sent Comrade Zhang Side to lead a platoon to the deep mountains of Tuhuanggou south of Yan'an to burn charcoal. This platoon was temporarily composed of comrades from various platoons, totaling eleven people, including me. At that time, we were all in our twenties, and Comrade Zhang Side was only twenty-five years old. Except for him, no one had ever burned charcoal before. The task was very arduous, and there were many difficulties. However, when the superiors asked him, "Is there any difficulty?" he firmly replied, "There are difficulties, but we can overcome them! The current difficulties are much less than when we crossed the snow mountains and grasslands." For any task given by the Party, no matter how difficult or arduous, Comrade Zhang Side always responded firmly and completed it without fail. He often told us, "Everything is done by people."

On the day we received the task, Comrade Zhang Side convened a party small group meeting and then a platoon meeting. He repeatedly explained to everyone, "Burning charcoal is to ensure that comrades have firewood to keep warm in winter and overcome the cold. This is a political task and an important revolutionary work." He also required everyone to prepare to overcome difficulties. He said, "Burning charcoal is dirty, tiring, and consumes a lot of clothes. Life is even harder than in Yan'an. Entering the forest is like going to war. Everyone should be prepared for battle." After the meeting, he also talked to each comrade individually to understand their difficulties. He also hurriedly prepared from all aspects. He brought over a dozen axes and let everyone choose one, and the last one he took himself.

The next early morning, Comrade Zhang Side led us, carrying tools and dry rations, and set out. Along the way, we sang revolutionary songs such as "Forward, forward, forward! Our army marches towards the sun..." and our spirits were very high. As the sun set, we arrived at Tuhuanggou.

The mountains around Tuhuanggou were very high, covered with dense primitive forests, and the ground was full of tall wild grass mixed with fallen leaves. There was no path in the mountains, so we could only follow the trails of wild animals. As soon as we entered the forest, there was a sense of mystery. The dense branches and layers of leaves blocked the sunlight, leaving only a few scattered shadows. Looking up, one could hardly see the sky. From the depths of the forest, sometimes the roars of leopards, wild boars, and yellow deer, and the songs of various birds could be heard. We did not have time to admire the beauty of the forest and immediately focused on investigating the distribution of oak trees and the soil conditions of the slopes. Comrade Zhang Side told us: "There are all kinds of trees in the forest, but the ones suitable for burning charcoal are oak trees. We must investigate the growth and distribution of oak trees to decide where to build the kilns."

At night, he mobilized all the comrades in the platoon to discuss the charcoal-burning plan. He said, "Although I have burned kilns before, it was in another place with different conditions. We must burn kilns based on the local forest, soil, and road conditions. Everyone should discuss more and think of ways to win this battle together." Comrade Zhang Side's humble attitude inspired everyone's enthusiasm. That night, we discussed enthusiastically, each expressing their opinions. Finally, Comrade Zhang Side summarized everyone's opinions and decided to build seven kilns, three in the front valley and four in the back valley. The entire platoon was divided into two combat groups: one for cutting trees and the other for building kilns.

We officially began our charcoal-burning battle. Every day, as soon as it was light, we went up the mountain to work. Those who cut trees cut trees, and those who built kilns built kilns. We did not return to the mountain until it was dark. At noon, we usually ate on the mountain. Life was very hard, with no vegetables to eat, only salt water with rice, but during work, someone would sing a little tune, someone would tell a joke, and laughter and song would often echo through the forest. Comrade Zhang Side often told us stories of the Long March. During rest, he would also take out his self-made flute and play a few Erxian tunes from Shaanxi, such as "When the Red Army Brother Returns" and "Little Cowherd." The roars of wild beasts and the chirping of birds in the ancient forest were now drowned out by the laughter of revolutionary soldiers. The ancient forest was filled with youthful vitality.

Comrade Zhang Side mobilized the masses to write slogans such as "Self-reliance, overcome difficulties, and strive to complete the charcoal-burning task given by the Party!" "Down with Japanese imperialism, liberate all of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" on the slopes in front of and behind the charcoal kilns, and at the tree trunks of various passes. When we felt tired, as soon as we saw these inspiring slogans, our spirits would immediately rise again.

To turn an oak tree into charcoal, it goes through eight or nine processes: felling, building kilns, burning kilns, unloading kilns, bundling, and carrying. Comrade Zhang Side, through practice, carefully pondered and created a method of simultaneous felling, loading kilns, and igniting, and unloading kilns. He also organized labor power reasonably by letting everyone carry a bag of charcoal down the mountain at the end of the day. For each technical process, Comrade Zhang Side, on the one hand, taught his experience to everyone without reservation, on the other hand, continued to study and humbly learned from the new experiences of the comrades. Once we burned a kiln of particularly good charcoal, each piece of charcoal was shiny and blue, like it had been electroplated, and it rang when tapped, with no sheep horns (indicating unburned wood) and very few broken pieces. After unloading the kiln, he let everyone rest and discuss why this kiln produced such good charcoal? Through this discussion, we summarized a set of good charcoal-burning experiences. Comrade Zhang Side paid great attention to saving. When cutting trees, he repeatedly reminded us to cherish the seedlings and save wood. After burning good charcoal, he always reminded us not to throw away a single piece of charcoal, and even the broken charcoal should not be thrown away.

In the midst of intense labor, Comrade Zhang Side always led the way. I remember that at that time, if a person cut eighteen or nineteen trees a day, it was quite impressive. However, Comrade Zhang Side always cut more than twenty trees. When carrying charcoal, others carried one bag at a time, but he carried two bags. Unloading the kiln was the most intense moment, requiring every second to be counted. The temperature inside the kiln was very high, and if it was unloaded slowly, the wind would blow and the entire kiln of charcoal would catch fire and turn into ashes. Comrade Zhang Side often said, "When unloading the kiln, we must act as if we are annihilating the enemy, and the actions must be fast!" However, every time the kiln was unloaded, Comrade Zhang Side always quickly crawled into the kiln first and worked the longest. When he came out, he was covered in black, and his clothes were soaked with sweat. Comrades jokingly said he had malaria.

When the weather turned bad, Comrade Zhang Side would worry. At night, he could not sleep, fearing that rainwater would pour into the chimney and ruin the charcoal kilns. Once, in the middle of the night, a heavy rain fell, and Comrade Zhang Side immediately put on his clothes, picked up his shovel, and rushed to the back valley to carefully inspect the charcoal kilns. Later, I and Comrade Shen Chengxing arrived, and he had already inspected three kilns. Seeing us, he affectionately scolded, "Why don't you sleep well and come here to do what! One person here is enough!" We inspected all the charcoal kilns together and returned to the dormitory. It was already dawn. Comrade Zhang Side entered the door, saw that some comrades had kicked off their quilts, and hurriedly and gently covered them up. Then he lay down. As the sky brightened, he got up again and went to the mountain with the comrades.

One day, Comrade Zhang Side found that Zhang Minquan, a comrade from a student background, was in low spirits, and asked him what was wrong. He said, "I cut fewer trees, and the thick ones I can't carry, always falling behind the others, I feel uncomfortable." After understanding the situation, Comrade Zhang Side encouraged him, saying, "Tomorrow, you can cut some thinner trees, which are easier to cut and carry. As long as you work according to your strength, you don't have to force yourself, and you don't have to feel embarrassed. Strength is gradually cultivated." After that, Comrade Zhang Side always assigned him lighter work and, based on his characteristics, assigned him some propaganda and education work, such as teaching characters and writing slogans. This way, Zhang Minquan's mood improved, and his work became better. He said, "The platoon leader really knows how to care for people!" This incident gave me a great education. Originally, as soon as we arrived in Tuhuanggou, Comrade Zhang Side repeatedly reminded everyone, "At the beginning, do less heavy work, first temper yourself, and then gradually increase the workload." He also repeatedly told me, "You must care for the health of the comrades."

Once, I and Comrade Shen Chengxing burned a kiln of charcoal, and when we opened it, there were many sheep horns. We felt very sad, thinking that we would definitely be criticized. However, Comrade Zhang Side looked at it and smiled, saying, "Generally speaking, it is still not bad. Burning so many kilns, it is inevitable that there will be some sheep horns. He then helped us analyze the specific reasons for not burning through and sincerely checked, saying, "This kiln did not burn well, and the main responsibility should be mine." He repeatedly encouraged us, "Don't be afraid, continue to burn, and with more experience, it will get better." After hearing Comrade Zhang Side's words, our spirits immediately rose again.

Carrying charcoal down the mountain was a long distance, and everyone felt tired. Comrade Zhang Side saw this situation and picked up a shovel to build several high platforms along the way for the comrades to rest. He also told everyone to pad some dry grass behind their backs when carrying charcoal to avoid rubbing their shoulders. Comrade Zhang Side thought of every way to let the comrades rest on the way, but he himself, despite carrying more than everyone else, rarely rested on the way.

For the political progress of the comrades, Comrade Zhang Side was even more concerned. He saw the shortcomings and mistakes of the comrades and always pointed them out sincerely and patiently helped. However, he did not regard himself as an educator. He respected the comrades and treated everyone equally. If a comrade had an opinion, he always let the person finish speaking and considered it carefully. Therefore, everyone was willing to work with Comrade Zhang Side. During the charcoal burning, our platoon had a comrade named Zhang Cuihua whose performance was not good, and the comrades all disliked him, but Comrade Zhang Side always patiently united with him. Later, Zhang Cuihua changed and gratefully said, "This time, thanks to being with Comrade Zhang Side, not only did we burn good charcoal, but we also tempered our thoughts."

Later, Comrade Zhang Side led us to Tuhuanggou to burn charcoal twice more. Each time, we went in July and returned after October. Both times, we excellently completed the glorious task given by the Party and were commended by the superiors.

Comrade Zhang Side never considered personal gains or losses. In my interactions with him, I never heard him make any personal requests, nor did I see him worry about any personal matters. He always considered the sufferings of the people and the comrades, and enthusiastically cared for the growth of his comrades-in-arms. He always thought of others, was sincere and enthusiastic, and cared for others in detail.

In the summer of 1941, one noon, the comrades had already gone to sleep. Comrade Zhang Side was still engrossed in reading a book. The camp commander came in and called for an urgent document to be sent to the Third Company. The Third Company was located in Yangjiaping, about seven or eight miles away from us. Comrade Zhang Side did not wake anyone up and quietly took the document and set out. The summer noon was scorching, with the sun blazing down, and the dirt roads and mountain paths in Yan'an were also scorched by the sun. Comrade Zhang Side, regardless of all this, hurried forward. When he arrived in Yangjiaping, he was already drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. He entered the company headquarters, wanting to hand the document to the company commander. The company commanders were still sleeping, and he immediately thought, "The document is urgent, but I am running here, and it is not yet the specified time. Let the commanders rest a bit longer." With this in mind, he decided to wait outside. After a while, he handed the urgent document in.

In the summer, the Yanhe River suddenly flooded. The surging river, carrying mud and sand, roared and howled, like a startled horse breaking free from its reins, fiercely crashing against the embankment. Comrade Zhang Side returned from a mission outside and saw a basketball hoop on the riverside of the sports field. "Whose hoop is this? Soon, the big water will take it away! No, we cannot let public property be damaged!" With this in mind, he immediately ran back to the platoon, put down his gun, and called us to rescue it. When we arrived, the big water had already reached the sports field. Just as we lifted the basketball hoop, the big water came. Comrade Zhang Side, without taking off his clothes, jumped into the water, risking his life to pull the basketball hoop, floating with the water for a long distance before he managed to rescue it to the shore. Under his leadership, the other comrades also rescued the other hoop. At that time, I could not swim and stood on the shore, watching Comrade Zhang Side's heroic deeds, my heart was very moved. I recalled what he said to us in Tuhuanggou, "Revolutionary work is everywhere, but we must take the initiative to do it."

"Revolutionary work is everywhere, but we must take the initiative to do it." This sentence contains such a sublime revolutionary sense of responsibility! It was under this correct thought that, no matter how harsh the environment or how intense the struggle, Comrade Zhang Side, after completing his duties, would take the initiative to find work to do.

Whenever he had free time, he would go to help the kitchen boil water, carry water, and often read newspapers to the kitchen workers and teach them characters. There was a mute comrade in the kitchen who had come through the Long March. As soon as he saw Comrade Zhang Side, he would raise his thumb to praise him. Comrade Zhang Side also often took the time to help the stablemen chop straw, read newspapers to them, and tell stories of the Long March. The stablemen often proudly said, "Zhang Side is not only your platoon leader but also our platoon leader!"

On weekends, for Comrade Zhang Side, it was an even busier day. He was either helping the comrades mend clothes and make straw shoes or helping the villagers work in the fields. In short, he had too much work to do on weekends. In the summer, mosquitoes were particularly numerous, and everyone had no mosquito nets, and at night, they were bitten so much that they could not sleep. Some comrades jokingly said, "Sleeping is not comfortable, mosquitoes are biting everywhere, and if you stretch out your hand to catch them, you don't know how many there are." Comrade Zhang Side saw this situation and went up the mountain on weekends to pull a lot of wormwood, twisted it into ropes, dried it, and provided it for everyone to burn at night to drive away mosquitoes. We saw Comrade Zhang Side always busy working, and we felt sorry for him, often advising him to rest. He smiled and said, "I only did a little work, it's nothing. Even if I did more, it wouldn't be tiring."

At that time, quilts were scarce. At first, two people shared one quilt, and later, although each person had one quilt, there was no mattress, so two people still shared one quilt, one to cover and one to lie on. Comrade Zhang Side and I often shared one quilt. When sleeping, he always covered me more and covered himself less. When the quilt was dirty, he always took the initiative to wash it. Comrade Zhang Side often made straw shoes and mended clothes for us. As soon as we took off our dirty clothes, sometimes they were not there, and after carefully searching, we found that Comrade Zhang Side had already washed them clean. If a comrade was sick, he took care of him more carefully than his own family. Once, a comrade was so sick that he could not get out of bed, and Comrade Zhang Side enthusiastically carried him to the toilet every day. We were far from the unit and carried out tasks alone. Comrade Zhang Side, to liven up everyone's life, also used potatoes to carve out plum blossoms and peach blossoms, printed them on birch bark, made playing cards, and let everyone have fun.

There was a young comrade in the service platoon named Liu Hezhong who did not like to study, did not work well, and as soon as he had free time, he hugged a basketball to play. Comrade Zhang Side saw this and enthusiastically advised him to work hard and study hard. Unexpectedly, Liu Hezhong frowned and said, "You are not my platoon leader, you can't boss me around!" Saying that, he turned around and ran away. Indeed, Liu Hezhong was in the service platoon, and Comrade Zhang Side was the platoon leader of the communication platoon, so he could not boss him around. Comrade Zhang Side was not upset by this. Comrade Zhang Side learned that Liu Hezhong was the youngest child in his family and had been spoiled since childhood, so he approached him more in life and influenced him more in work. In the morning, Comrade Zhang Side helped him draw water, and when going up the mountain to carry firewood, Comrade Zhang Side helped him bundle the firewood. Gradually, they became friends. Comrade Zhang Side talked to him, patiently educated him, "When you are young, you should study hard. Only by learning a skill can you better serve the people, and in the future, you can also adapt to the needs of the revolutionary development." Comrade Zhang Side also took out a notebook he had carefully kept for a few years from his bag and gave it to him. Later, Liu Hezhong finally became a good comrade and a good soldier.

Comrade Zhang Side's life was very hard and frugal. His cotton-padded jacket was already so tattered that it was almost impossible to mend. Everyone advised him to get a new one. However, he said, "No need to get a new one, I will mend it, and it can be worn for another two years." Later, he spent countless needles and threads, mended and patched, and finally turned the torn cotton-padded jacket into a new one. He really wore it for another two years.

Yan'an was all dirt roads and mountain paths, with many stones, and we often went out on missions, went up the mountain to produce, so the shoes were worn out very quickly. However, every time shoes were issued, he did not take any. He said, "I can make straw shoes. I take one less pair of shoes, and the villagers can reduce one pair of shoes." In fact, Comrade Zhang Side's shoes were all mended and mended. The worn-out parts were padded with dry grass or tree bark and patched up. When they were really worn out and could not be worn, he did not throw them away but took them off, washed them clean, dried them, and added some old cloth strips to make them again. To save shoes, Comrade Zhang Side often worked barefoot. He often took his old, worn-out socks and other people's discarded old socks, tore them apart, washed them clean, and made them into new socks to wear or gave them to the comrades.

Comrade Zhang Side had a tin bowl that he had brought with him during the Long March. The enamel was almost worn off, and it was full of pits and scars, looking very shabby, but he still did not want to throw it away. Once, we were issued new tin bowls. He gave the new one to another comrade and continued to use the old one. Comrade Zhang Side also had a very old fountain pen, the tip of which was already short and thick, and the words written with it were almost as big as small regular script written with a brush, but he still used it as usual. When the tip was too thick, he sharpened it himself. He cherished this pen very much and made a small cloth pocket for it.

From 1941 to 1942, it was the most difficult period for the anti-Japanese base areas. At that time, we had difficulty getting food, and for a period, there was not even millet, and we could only eat some sprouted wheat. The food brought back from the canteen was not enough to eat. Comrade Zhang Side saw that everyone did not have enough to eat and picked up the water bucket to go out to draw water, actually to avoid the comrades and let them eat more. He once said to me, "The comrades have just joined the army and are in the process of growth. Let them eat more to build up their bodies to adapt to the needs of the battle. I eat less, it's the same." There was little food, and sometimes there was no food to eat. Comrade Zhang Side often used his rest time to dig wild vegetables, pick wild fruits, or catch a few mountain chickens to improve the lives of everyone. One Sunday, he ran dozens of miles and caught many fish from a fish pond. He brought them back, dried them into fish jerky, and roasted them on the fire to let everyone have a "feast." Everyone ate heartily, and Comrade Zhang Side, as usual, picked up the water bucket to go draw water.

For Comrade Zhang Side's hard and frugal, selfless style, I admired him very much and often asked him, "Why do you always save and eat so frugally, wearing mended clothes?" He explained, "My past life was much harder than now. After joining the Red Army, I felt that life was much happier." Sometimes he also answered, "Now there are still many people who wear more rags than me. The whole country still has millions and millions of laboring people who have not been liberated. The revolution is still very difficult. If everyone saves a little, it can solve a big problem for the revolution. Besides, we are Communist Party members and should follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, eat bitterness first and enjoy later. We should think more about the people, do more work, and not consider personal life." Comrade Zhang Side's hard and frugal style and high class consciousness left a deep impression on me.

With our own hands, we will have enough clothes and food

In the autumn of 1941, the Security Regiment arrived in Nanluwan. We responded to Chairman Mao's call: "With our own hands, we will have enough clothes and food." Here, we had to take grain from the barren mountains to overcome the serious difficulties caused by the economic blockade of Japanese imperialism and the Nationalist reactionary army.

Nanluwan is about ninety miles from Yan'an, surrounded by high mountains, with only a few houses at the foot of the mountains. When we first arrived in Nanluwan, we had no place to live. Comrade Zhang Side led us to build triangular sheds with tree branches, cut some wild grass to use as bedding, and at night, everyone crowded into the shed to sleep, and as soon as we lay down, we could see the stars. At that time, food was even more difficult, and there was no vegetable to eat, only salt water with rice, and salt was also scarce. He often told us, "Now, although we have no place to live and no vegetables to eat, we have the correct leadership of our beloved leader Chairman Mao, and we can overcome any difficulty." The temperature in Nanluwan was much lower than in Yan'an. Although it was only deep autumn, the nights were already cold. To prepare for winter, the unit commander required each company to quickly move into the cave dwellings. Comrade Zhang Side was an expert in digging caves and became our technical instructor. He led us to choose the terrain and start digging caves. At that time, the tools for digging caves, except for the pickaxes brought from Yan'an, the small carts, earth baskets, etc., were all made by ourselves. The red clay soil on the slopes of Nanluwan was very hard, and the pickaxes swung down, "clang, clang," shaking the hands sore. Comrade Zhang Side did not stop swinging the pickaxe, his hands blistered but did not rest. The comrades snatched the pickaxe from him, and he drove the handcart to push the earth. When encountering large soil blocks, the cart could not be pushed, he let us lift the soil block onto his back, and he carried it to the ditch to throw it away. After the cave mouth was dug out, he rushed into the cave to work. The weather gradually turned cold, but Comrade Zhang Side worked bare-chested, and his body was covered in sweat. The sweat and clay stuck together, tightly glued to his body. When he returned to work, Comrade Zhang Side had turned into a mud man.

In Nanluwan, except for the dense primitive forests, the mountain slopes were covered with large patches of wolf's bane. We chose these places to clear the land. We cut down the wolf's bane bushes and then set them on fire. In an instant, the whole mountain was filled with smoke and fire, roaring in the wind. After the fire passed, a black flat ground appeared. We then turned over the fertile yellow soil to cultivate. Our tools were very primitive, each person only had a pickaxe, to fight against the barren mountains, it was very difficult. Comrade Zhang Side often encouraged us, "Clearing the land and producing grain, not only to improve life, but more importantly, we actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, with our own hands, self-sufficient, to overcome the enemy's economic blockade." Comrade Zhang Side not only said this but also did it seriously. The pickaxe he used was the one left by others, but when clearing the land, no one could compare with him. On the first day of clearing the land, Comrade Zhang Side exceeded the quota set by the superiors and was commended by the commanders. I deeply felt that Comrade Zhang Side's revolutionary will was very firm, which made him have a tenacious will and become a "steel bone." With such a good platoon leader leading the way, who would not be full of fighting spirit! Every day, as soon as it was light, we went up the mountain to clear the land, and the whole mountain valley echoed with the sound of pickaxes breaking the earth. Truly, hard work makes the land fertile, and that year the crops grew very vigorously, and we achieved a bumper harvest.

Later, we were ordered to go to Mengjiaojiu on the east side of Nanluwan to clear the land and produce. Here, in addition to the primitive forests, there were also many marshes that could trap people, covered with reeds. We moved into the grass huts made of tree branches. One night, a heavy rain fell, and Comrade Zhang Side immediately opened his quilt to cover everyone from the rain. However, the rain did not stop, and we were all soaked like drowned rats, and the weaker comrades shivered uncontrollably. Later, it was Comrade Zhang Side who thought of a way, telling us to pick up the shovels, and each person found a place to avoid the rain on the slope. Everyone hid inside, and no matter how much it rained, it was no problem. At that time, in addition to completing the formal production tasks, to solve the problem of comrades who smoked, we also used our spare time to plant some tobacco leaves. Planting tobacco leaves was very troublesome, in addition to watering, it was also necessary to apply fertilizer and prune. Comrade Zhang Side, who did not smoke, always rolled up his trousers, barefoot, and rushed to carry manure to fertilize the tobacco leaves.

Carry the heavy burden

I and Comrade Zhang Side worked in the Communication Platoon. At that time, communication work had no modern transportation tools. Sending letters and conveying orders could only rely on two legs, and urgent documents, we would run quickly to deliver.

In communication work, Comrade Zhang Side always took the heavy burden and completed the tasks without fail. One night, it was raining heavily, and the commander ordered us to send an urgent letter to Qiaozigou (Qiaozigou was the location of the Lu Xun Art Academy at that time). Comrade Zhang Side had just returned from delivering a letter, and this time it was someone else's turn to go. However, he considered that the task was urgent, and the road was muddy, so he decided to go himself. He took the letter, put on his gun, and set out. From our base in Beigouqiao to Qiaozigou, there were fifteen or sixteen miles, and one had to slide down the slope, cross Qingliangshan, pass by the gate of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Dongguan, and Yan'an Airport. The cave dwellings were mostly on the half-mountain, so when we arrived in Qiaozigou, we still had to climb up and down the big and small stone ridges. Comrade Zhang Side braved the rain, groped his way in the dark, and hurried forward. The rain fell harder and harder, what if the letter got wet? Comrade Zhang Side thought of this and quickly took out the shoes he had tucked under his armpit, put the letter inside, and fastened the shoes, just enough to wrap the letter. He timely delivered the letter to Qiaozigou. Later, we heard from the comrades in Qiaozigou that Comrade Zhang Side's clever way of protecting the document, and everyone admired it and laughed heartily.

Another time, it was winter. As soon as it was light, the sky was filled with large snowflakes, and the cold northwest wind howled. The commander ordered an urgent document to be sent to Xiaopenggou. Our Fourth Company's First Platoon was stationed there. Comrade Zhang Side wore an old cotton-padded jacket, a worn-out fur hat, and a pair of broken cotton shoes issued three years ago, and set out against the wind and snow. Passing Wangjiaping, Yanhe River, Dapenggou, Central Party School, and Dashiqian, it was very difficult to walk. When he completed the task and returned, we saw that he was covered with a thin layer of frost, even on his eyebrows, and his fur hat had frozen into a steel helmet, and his hands were also frozen stiff. The comrades asked him with concern, "Is it very cold?" He smiled and said, "No matter how cold the weather is, it cannot freeze the hearts of revolutionary soldiers!"

We were clearing the land and producing in Nanluwan, and we still insisted on communication work. To ensure that production and work were not affected, Comrade Zhang Side often worked day and night. I remember one night, the commander ordered an urgent order to be conveyed to each company. That day, we had been digging caves all day, and everyone was very tired. Comrade Zhang Side saw that the comrades were sleeping soundly and took his gun and set out. I and he shared one quilt, and after realizing this, I immediately got up, wanting to replace him, but he would not agree.

When clearing the land in Mengjiaojiu, one night, we went to Nanluwan to deliver a letter. Mengjiaojiu was twenty miles away from Nanluwan, with only one small path in the middle of a sea of trees, often with leopards appearing. During the day, even one person going in felt eerie. To ensure safety, the commander let me and Comrade Zhang Side go together. When we left, I said to him, "The locals say that there are many leopards in this place..." Comrade Zhang Side calmly said, "There is nothing to be afraid of, compared to crossing the grasslands, it is nothing. At that time, in front and behind, there were more ferocious Nationalist reactionary armies and local counter-revolutionary teams than leopards." Comrade Zhang Side's fearless spirit immediately infected me. Although it was only twenty miles, we had to cross more than ten winding small rivers. When encountering wide water, Comrade Zhang Side would not let me go down into the water, and he would carry me across the river. When we completed the task and returned to Mengjiaojiu, it was already dawn, and the comrades had all gone to work in the fields. Comrade Zhang Side let me rest well, but he quietly slipped out and went to work in the fields with everyone. I turned over and found that Comrade Zhang Side was not there, and I also hurriedly went to work in the fields.

One summer, to improve the lives of the troops, the quartermaster bought five pigs in Luohechuan. The leadership sent me and Comrade Zhang Side to drive the pigs back. Luohechuan was seventy or eighty miles away from Yan'an, and we took some dry rations and set out. In the evening, we arrived in Luohechuan. We could have stayed overnight, but Comrade Zhang Side said, "Driving pigs is best done at night. It's cool, and the pigs are obedient. Tonight there is also a moon, let's go!" I said, "Good." So we drove the pigs on the road. At first, the pigs were very obedient and walked straight ahead. After walking dozens of miles, we encountered a small river, and the pigs did not dare to cross the bridge and always wanted to run into the river. Comrade Zhang Side tried it, and the water was not very deep, so he said, "The pigs don't want to cross the bridge, let's take a bath with the pigs." We rolled up our trousers, and he called in front, and I drove from behind, and the pigs immediately happily followed us into the river. Who knew that they played in the water and swam downstream for several miles, and no matter how we drove, they would not come out. This time, we were really in trouble. Comrade Zhang Side thought for a moment and immediately took off his military pants, tied the cuffs, filled them with water, and turned them into a water monster. The pigs were immediately frightened and rushed to the shore. Seeing this, I laughed so hard that my stomach hurt. After getting ashore, I said, "You have so many tricks!" He casually said, "Doing what, you have to think of ways to do it. Otherwise, if the pigs are washed away, this political task cannot be completed." I was surprised, "Driving pigs is also a political task?" Comrade Zhang Side seriously said, "All the work given to us by the Party and the superiors, no matter what task, we should complete it as a political task. For example, this time, if the pigs run away, it doesn't matter if we are criticized, but more importantly, everyone cannot eat meat, affecting life, how can we defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!"

Become one with the masses

Comrade Zhang Side went to every place and became one with the local masses, establishing the closest ties. When burning charcoal, we lived in the home of an old peasant named Ma. Every day, Comrade Zhang Side helped the old peasant sweep the courtyard, carry water, and feed the cattle. When there was time, he also helped to take care of the children, so that the adults could do more housework. Once, we had a communal meal, and each person had very little pork, but he did not want to eat it and left half to give to the old peasant's child. Every Sunday, he took us to the fields to help the old peasant work. When plowing, he was both fast and careful. When harvesting, if there was a stalk of grain left on the ground, he would pick it up. The old peasant named Ma, seeing this, praised, "Your platoon leader is really a good one! Burning charcoal is so tiring, and he still comes to help us do this and that, he is really a good soldier educated by Chairman Mao!" When we completed the task and returned to Yan'an, the old peasants all sent us to the village gate, reluctantly saying, "Old Zhang, come again!" "Comrades, don't forget to come again!" Comrade Zhang Side sincerely replied, "If you have something, come to Yan'an, and come to the unit to find us!" Later, the old peasant named Ma came to Yan'an and indeed came to the unit to find Comrade Zhang Side. The old peasant enthusiastically said, "Our whole village misses you. My child still often says, 'I want to find Uncle Zhang to play'!" Comrade Zhang Side enthusiastically received the old peasant.

Comrade Zhang Side established close ties with the masses, the most fundamental reason was that he always put the interests of the masses first and regarded the affairs of the masses as more important than his own. In the autumn of 1940, we were busy carrying charcoal down the mountain from Tuhuanggou. Once, Comrade Zhang Side carried a large bundle of charcoal and was walking down the mountain. Suddenly, a donkey came towards him, carrying many things. The donkey saw him carrying charcoal and, for some reason, suddenly stopped. Comrade Zhang Side, fearing that the donkey would run away and the old peasant would suffer a loss, quickly retreated and found a place to hide. After the donkey passed, the old peasant driving the donkey approached Comrade Zhang Side and thanked him, "Comrade, thank you!" Comrade Zhang Side replied, "This is what I should do." Another time, a comrade carried a bag of charcoal and walked on the road. The rope broke, and the farmer's few old corn stalks were crushed. Comrade Zhang Side immediately criticized, "Why not be more careful! Look, the old peasant's few old corn stalks took so much hard work! Chairman Mao taught us to cherish the farmer's every blade of grass and tree." Later, Comrade Zhang Side personally went to apologize to the old peasant. In the evening, he also convened a platoon meeting to check the cause and learn from the lesson. From then on, when carrying charcoal, we all checked each other to see if the charcoal was bundled tightly and then carried it away.

We were clearing the land in Nanluwan, and once I and Comrade Zhang Side went to an old peasant's house to borrow a hoe. As soon as we entered the courtyard, the old man and his wife were chopping straw. Comrade Zhang Side immediately went over and said, "Auntie, you rest, let me do it." Saying that, he took the sickle and started chopping. I also quickly went to hand over the straw. The old woman looked at us and smiled, "Have you seen Chairman Mao in Yan'an?" We replied, "We have." "Chairman Mao is our savior!" The old woman sighed, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading the Eighth Route Army to live in Yan'an, how could we here be so peaceful! This Nanluwan, in the past, there were many Nationalist and bandits! Since Chairman Mao came, we here have finally lived a peaceful life." Comrade Zhang Side immediately followed up, saying, "Yes! This time our troops are here to clear the land and produce according to Chairman Mao's orders. We will build Nanluwan as good as Jiangnan, defeat Japanese imperialism and thoroughly smash the Nationalist reactionary army's blockade. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao, we will also make all the people of the country obtain thorough liberation, just like us, the people of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, who are not oppressed and exploited." The old woman happily said, "That would be great!" Comrade Zhang Side always seized the opportunity to popularize the Party's policies to the masses in a simple way and spread the news of victories on the front lines. Back in the platoon, Comrade Zhang Side also told everyone about the old woman's words. He said, "We are the people's children, and we should unite with the people everywhere. Pick up the gun, we are the army; put down the gun, we are farmers. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: the people's army and the people are inseparable like fish and water."

Learn for the revolution

Comrade Zhang Side often advised us, "Look further, to the future. Our revolutionary cause is developing day by day, and in the future, we will go to communism! In the future, the revolution needs us to do more work. We must seize the time to study, or we will fall behind!"

He advised others like this and also demanded this of himself. No matter whether it was going up the mountain to burn charcoal, clearing the land and producing, rushing to repair fortifications, or staying at home on duty, or how tired he was, as long as he had a moment of free time, he insisted on studying, studying culture, reading newspapers, and reading political textbooks. When going out to produce, as soon as he rested, he would take a stick and practice writing on the ground. When he returned home, after eating, he would write characters on the sand table he made himself.

At that time, the conditions for study were very poor, and the border area almost had no paper and pencils. Not only was it like this during the most difficult period, but even after the great production movement was launched, the problem of lacking paper and pens was not completely solved. At that time, whoever could pick up some old textbooks or old newspapers to write on would be very happy. Whoever had a decent notebook or a pencil would be more precious than anything. The superiors once awarded Comrade Zhang Side a few notebooks and a few pencils, and he did not want to use them, wrapping them tightly in his bundle. The difficult conditions did not stop Comrade Zhang Side from studying. When we went to Tuhuanggou to burn charcoal, he found many birch trees and made some notebooks with birch bark. Comrade Zhang Side also used old tin cans, cut a pen tip, found a stick, tied it together, and used it as a fountain pen. Later, he found a way to make a new type of fountain pen with old bullet shells. When the teacher taught cultural courses or the political instructor taught political courses, Comrade Zhang Side always first wrote on the ground with a pen, and after practicing, he copied it into the birch bark notebook with a pencil. At that time, kerosene was very difficult to get, and only a little was issued, so it was not possible to study at night. Comrade Zhang Side would cut some cypress branches to use as candles. After we harvested the hemp seeds, he would go to the field to pick up some that had fallen, string them together, and also use them as candles. Otherwise, he would use the moonlight to read and write.

Comrade Zhang Side was born into a poor peasant family and was deprived of the right to study by the old society. When he joined the army, he did not know a single character. Under the cultivation and education of the Party, he studied hard by himself, and when we were together, he could already write general reports to the superiors and write letters for the comrades.

At that time, most of the comrades in our platoon were younger than Comrade Zhang Side, including me. Whenever we had free time, we would play and not study seriously. Comrade Zhang Side always persuaded us patiently to study hard. I remember once a comrade said, "Studying, there is not even a table, it's really inconvenient." Comrade Zhang Side said, "Don't we all have a portable table?" Saying that, he sat down and started writing on his two knees, making everyone laugh heartily. Once, celebrating May Day, he said to us, "This year, we celebrate May Day in Yan'an, and in the future, we don't know where we will go to celebrate May Day! The revolutionary cause will develop, and we need to do more work. We must seize the time to study!" Comrade Zhang Side's own culture was not high, but he still did his best to help everyone study. As soon as he had free time in the morning and evening, he would teach the comrades to read characters, write characters, or read political textbooks and "Liberation Daily." At first, my study enthusiasm was not high, and he criticized me, "You can't even write your own name, how can you do that! You must know that only with culture can you read newspapers and understand more revolutionary truths." He also held my hand and taught me to write the characters "Chen Yao." To give me more time to study, he often went on missions for me. Comrade Zhang Side also organized a few comrades in the platoon with higher culture to tutor us in our studies. Later, our platoon finally formed a study craze, and it was often seen that three people gathered together, two people paired up to read newspapers, write characters, and study political textbooks. I myself used the birch bark notebook, half a pencil, and a wooden pen given by Comrade Zhang Side to take off the illiteracy hat. Now, recalling it, I really regret that I did not study enough at that time.

Be a good soldier

In the winter of 1942, we returned to Yan'an from Nanluwan. Soon, one day, the camp commander called Comrade Zhang Side and me. The political instructor, Comrade Chun Jie, said, "This platoon, you have led it well. Whether from the political and ideological situation of the soldiers or from the completion of the tasks, it is very good. This time, according to the instructions of the superiors, our unit will be reorganized into the Central Guard Regiment. Your platoon will be allocated to various companies. Do you have any opinions?" Comrade Zhang Side replied, "According to the needs of the Party, we have no opinions." The instructor said, "After the reorganization, we do not need so many platoon leaders and deputy platoon leaders. You two will return to the platoon as soldiers, how about it?" Comrade Zhang Side immediately happily replied, "Firmly obey the organizational arrangements. Whatever the organization arranges, it is to serve the people. I will definitely be a good soldier." I also expressed obedience to the organizational arrangements.

The next day, Comrade Zhang Side, as usual, got up very early, prepared the washing water for the comrades, and then started to pack his own bag. He packed a small, torn quilt into his bag and left the larger quilt we had shared for three years to me. From Nanluwan, we brought back a grass mat and a yellow sheep skin. He left the yellow sheep skin for me and took the grass mat himself. He knew I could not make straw shoes and loved to play basketball, so he took out the only pair of new straw shoes from his bundle and gave them to me. To encourage the comrades to continue studying, he took out a few notebooks awarded by the superiors a few years ago from his bundle and gave them to Comrade Shen Chengxing and others. After eating breakfast, we two put on our bags, shouldered the grass mat, and went to the company to report. On the way, he said to me, "We two have worked together for a few years and cooperated very well. This time, the superiors decided that you and I will both be soldiers. Do you have any opinions?" I said, "No opinions, obey the organizational arrangements, do whatever is assigned." He was very satisfied and said, "Yes, doing any work is for the Party to work, and it is for the interests of the people." He also repeatedly reminded me to continue studying culture and overcome the habit of being impatient.

After that, we were no longer together, but we were still in the same regiment and often saw each other. He still cared for me as before. In the company, whether it was standing guard, patrolling, or producing, he did it very well and fulfilled his promise: "Be a good soldier."

In 1944, the organization decided to send him up the mountain to burn charcoal again. Before leaving, he specially found me and said with concern, "This time, you and I won't be partners. You should work hard at home and study hard." He asked me, "How have you been working and studying recently? Do you have any difficulties?" I replied, "As usual." He shook his head and said, "That's okay! In the future, you can't say that anymore." At that time, I was ashamed and lowered my head. "As usual," this standard was indeed too low. How could a revolutionary soldier demand this of himself? He asked me about my shortcomings and how I had overcome them. I replied, "Somewhat overcome." He shook his head again and then patiently and seriously said, "You can't say somewhat overcome; for one's own shortcomings and faults, one must overcome them firmly. You should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, wash your face every day, sweep the floor every day. Otherwise, the dust will accumulate and be bad!" He also reminded me, "You should study culture more, learn to write reports, write letters, I brought you a diary, a pencil. In the future, I won't replace you to write letters. If you have any difficulties, write to me." That time, we talked for a long time. He encouraged me to work hard and help the comrades around me. Finally, he tightly held my hands and said goodbye. I was grateful for his warm care, but I couldn't say anything, only to report to him with better results when he returned. However, I never imagined that this would be our last conversation.

On September 5, 1944, Comrade Zhang Side was unfortunately martyred in Anse County while burning charcoal. The bad news came, and I was immediately overwhelmed with grief. Zhang Side, what a good comrade! He was always loyal to the Party and the people's cause, and he always worked hard and conscientiously completed any task given by the Party. He had a firm revolutionary will and was always steadfast and optimistic in the face of difficulties. He worked wholeheartedly for the people's interests and never considered personal gains or losses. He cared for, cherished, and helped the comrades without any reservations. He always put hardship first and enjoyment last, worked hard, and set an example. He was frugal, studied hard, was humble and cautious, and strictly disciplined himself. In every aspect, he set an example for me and gave me great help. Such a close comrade-in-arms suddenly left me forever! Memories flooded my heart, and tears could not help but well up. In the first few days, I was immersed in grief, and whenever someone mentioned Comrade Zhang Side, my eyes would immediately moisten.

On the afternoon of September 8, at the foot of the west mountain of the front valley of Zaoyuan in Yan'an, the comrades held a memorial meeting for Comrade Zhang Side. The venue was filled with wreaths made of wildflowers by various departments. Our beloved leader Chairman Mao personally wrote a eulogy: "In memory of Comrade Zhang Side, who sacrificed for the people's interests." More than a thousand people from the Central Organs and our unit attended the meeting, and Chairman Mao delivered a famous speech at the meeting: "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for me. I decided to turn grief into strength and forever carry forward Comrade Zhang Side's revolutionary spirit, working wholeheartedly for the Party and the people's interests.

Comrade Zhang Side has been gone for twenty-two years. During these years, whether in the hard years of war or in the peaceful years of construction, Comrade Zhang Side's great communist spirit has always inspired me and urged me forward. Every time I think of Comrade Zhang Side, I feel full of strength. After the liberation of the whole country, I often followed the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, taking Comrade Zhang Side as an example, demanding of myself. Comrade Zhang Side will always live in my heart and in the hearts of the people of the whole country.

    忆张思德同志
    陈耀
    为了共同的目标
    每当我读到毛主席著作《为人民服务》，就想起了我的老班长张思德同志。
    张思德同志牺牲已经二十二年了。这些年来，他一直活在我的心里。他的伟大的共产主义精神，一直鼓舞着我奋勇前进。
    我和张思德同志并肩战斗过五年。一九四○年春天，上级将我从中央军委警卫营四连调到营部通信班工作，营教导员淳杰同志向我介绍：“你们的班长张思德，是经过两万五千里长征的同志，你要向他好好学习。”教导员把我领到班里，我第一次见到了张思德同志。他是个中等个儿，虽然负过伤，仍然很健康，脸色黑红，两只眼睛特别精神。他身上穿着一身褪色的灰粗布军装，脚穿一双旧草鞋，穿着虽然破旧，但是十分整齐、干净。一接触，就给我一个深刻的印象：朴素、诚恳。他笑着说：“我叫张思德，是四川仪陇县人。咱们这个班的同志来自各个省。今后咱们要按首长的指示团结一致，把保卫党中央和毛主席的光荣任务共同担负起来。”
    后来，我才知道，张思德同志出生在一个贫农家里。家里房无一间，地无一垄，靠父兄扛长活、做短工维持生活。他十二岁就开始给地主割草、放牛、担水、扫院子，受尽折磨。一九三三年，他十七岁的时候，参加了红军，不久加入了共产主义青年团，后来又加入了中国共产党。他作战非常勇敢、机智，有一次战斗，他一个人夺取了敌人两挺机枪，保证了整个战斗的胜利。他参加了两万五千里长征，翻雪山，过草地，历尽千辛万苦。但是不管环境怎样艰苦，斗争怎样残酷，他始终坚定、乐观。
    我到通信班以后，领导上叫我当副班长，我很怕干不好。一天傍晚，张思德同志把我叫出去，到窑洞前面找了个地方坐下，热情地和我谈起来。他把全班战士的思想和工作情况，一一地给我作了介绍，并且告诉我怎样领导一个班，鼓励我努力当好副班长。他说：“我们的责任是把全班同志领导好，这是党交给我们的光荣任务。要完成这个任务，就要咱们两个人以身作则，处处带头，脏活、累活咱们要先去干，不能怕艰苦。”他以亲身的经历告诉我要爱护战士：“长征时，有一点吃的东西，总是首长让给战士，战士让给首长。为什么那样互相爱护呢？因为咱们是共产党领导的人民军队，大家都是为一个目标战斗的阶级兄弟。比方咱们俩，我是四川人，你是山西人，相隔几千里，如果不参军，做梦也到不了一起。如今为了一个共同目标战斗在一起，这就比亲兄弟还亲。我们所有的同志都要一样地爱护。”张思德同志的谈话给了我很大的鼓舞和启发。我心里觉得有底了，有这样的班长鼓励我，帮助我，工作还怕搞不好吗？
    坚决保卫党中央、毛主席
    我调到张思德同志的班里不久，早已包围了陕甘宁边区的国民党反动派军队阴谋窜扰延安。一九四○年初夏的一天黑夜，部队紧急集合，连夜开赴前线。
    在急行军中，张思德同志关心着每个同志，时而帮助这个战士背枪，时而帮助那个同志背干粮袋。过河时没有桥，有个同志脚磨破了，张思德同志怕他趟水脚痛，背着他过了河。
    天将晌午，我们到达了目的地姚店子。姚店子是个小镇，距延安只有五十多里，是延安东北的重要道口。一到目的地，张思德同志放下枪和背包，便抢着提起水桶为同志们打洗脸水，接着又拿起扫帚扫窑洞。班里的事安置完了，他又帮助炊事班烧水做饭去了。相处不久，我就体会到，张思德同志是个为集体闲不住的人。
    饭后，马上开了班务会。张思德同志传达了首长的命令，要我们在这里做好战斗准备，歼灭敢于进犯延安的国民党反动派。一听说国民党反动派要窜犯延安，大家都非常气愤，个个摩拳擦掌，准备给敌人致命的打击。记得张思德同志跟我们讲：“国民党反动派要窜犯延安，咱们就在这里给他们个迎头痛击。来多少，就消灭他们多少，绝不能让他们前进一步！坚决保卫党中央和毛主席。”张思德同志还诙谐地说：“这回敌人把武器送上门来了，咱们一定收下，好好补充补充。”逗得大家哄堂大笑。
    姚店子座落在山谷中间，两边是高山，中间是延河。下午，我们便上山修筑工事。山坡上长满了芦苇和野草，地下全是胶泥和卵石，用铁锹挖起来非常吃力，一镐下去，也只有一寸多深。但是我们抱着保卫党中央和毛主席的决心，这些困难哪在话下。每天一上山，我们一股劲地挖，谁也不肯休息，进度很快。张思德同志比我们任何人挖得都更快。他挖完了自己的工事，不怕手已磨出血泡，就接着帮助别人挖。挖的时候，他提醒我们，不要损坏了庄稼。收工回来，还沿途拾些柴火，带给炊事班。不几天，我们便在姚店子的高山上、大路上挖筑好了许多工事。
    接着，我们密切注视着敌人的行动，开始了紧张的练兵。那时，我们每人都有一支三八式步枪或自造的金钩儿步枪，一把大刀，三颗手榴弹。每天操练劈刀、刺杀、投弹、射击的本领。陕北的初夏，早晚还清凉，太阳一当空，便立刻灼热起来。我们在张思德同志的带领下，不管这些，只专心按照上级规定苦练杀敌本领，练得汗流浃背，还不肯罢休。张思德同志不但苦练在前，作出榜样，而且领导操练严肃认真，一丝不苟。有的同志“稍息”姿势不正确，他也不放过。他总是耐心地讲清道理，做出示范动作。有的新战士射击瞄准时，闭不上左眼，他叫在左眼上贴片树叶，并且鼓励他们说：“回去坚持练，慢慢习惯了，就能闭上左眼。”晚上，张思德同志常常领着我们认真演习，经常提醒我们，要带着保卫党中央的决心，带着敌情观念演习。并且随时把他的实战经验，如怎样做好伪装，隐蔽自己等等，传授给我们。
    张思德同志是班长，处处走在前头。对于武器，张思德同志非常爱护，有空儿就擦拭，在他的带动下，我们全班都把枪支保养得很好。
    由于我们做好了充分准备，国民党反动派没敢前进到姚店子，便像乌龟似地缩了回去。不久，我们胜利地返回了延安。
    一项政治任务
    一九四○年七月间，上级派张思德同志带一个班去延安南土黄沟的深山里烧木炭。这个班是从各班临时抽调一些同志组成的，共有十一人，我也参加了。当时我们都是二十来岁的青年，张思德同志当时也只有二十五岁，除了他，大家谁也没有烧过炭。任务非常艰巨，困难很多。可是当首长问他：“有困难吗？”他却坚定地回答：“困难是有，不过我们能克服！现在的困难比过雪山草地时少得多。”对于党交给他的任务，不管多么困难、多么艰巨，张思德同志一向都是这样坚决地回答，从来都是不折不扣地完成。他经常对我们说：“事情都是人办的。”
    接受任务的当天，张思德同志召开了党小组会，随后又召开了班务会，他反复向大家说明：“烧炭是为了保证同志们冬天烤火，战胜严寒。这是一项政治任务，重要的革命工作。”并且要求大家做好克服困难的准备。他说：“烧炭，又脏、又累，很费衣服，生活比延安还要艰苦。进入山林，如同打仗一样，大家要做好战斗准备。”会后，他又个别地找同志们谈心，了解大家还有什么困难。并且抓紧时间从各方面进行准备。他领来了十几把斧头，让同志们各自挑选一把，最后剩下了一把，自己拿起来。
    第二天清早，张思德同志带着我们，背上工具和干粮出发了。一路上，我们高唱“向前，向前，向前！我们的队伍向太阳……”等革命歌曲，情绪非常高涨。太阳偏西，我们到达土黄沟。
    土黄沟一带的山很高，满山都是茂密的原始森林，遍地都是齐眉的野草，夹杂着落叶。进山没有路，我们只能顺着野兽的足迹前进。一进入山林，就有一种神秘的感觉。那重重迭迭的枝丫，密密层层的树叶，封锁了阳光，只漏下星星点点的日影，抬头简直望不见天。从山林深处，时而传来豹子、野猪、黄羊的吼叫，和各种鸟儿的歌唱。我们来不及欣赏林海风光，便集中精力勘察青棡树的分布和山坡的土质情况。张思德同志告诉我们：森林里各种树都有，但是适合烧炭的是青棡树。要调查好青棡树的生长、分布情况，才能决定在哪儿打窑。
    晚上，他发动全班战士讨论烧炭计划。他说：“我过去虽然烧过窑，但那是在别的地方，跟这里的情况不同。我们要根据这里的森林、土质、道路情况来烧窑。大家要多商量，共同想办法才能打胜这一仗。”张思德同志的虚心态度，激发了大家的热情。那天晚上，我们你一言、我一语地各抒己见，讨论得十分热烈。最后张思德同志集中大家意见，决定共打七个窑，前沟打三个，后沟打四个。全班分成砍树、打窑两个战斗组。
    我们正式开始了烧炭的战斗。每天天刚蒙蒙亮，我们上山劳动，砍树的砍树，打窑的打窑。直到天黑才收工下山。晌午多半都在山上吃饭，生活虽然很苦，没有菜吃，只是盐水就饭，可是，劳动时，一会儿这个唱个小调，一会儿那个说个笑话，欢笑和歌声，不时地在山林里发出回响。张思德同志常给我们讲长征故事，休息时他还常拿出自己制作的笛子，吹几个陕北小调《当红军的哥哥回来了》、《小放牛》。山林里野兽的吼叫和鸟儿的唧喳声，现在被革命战士劳动的欢笑淹没了。古老的山林充满了青春的活力。
    张思德同志发动群众在炭窑前后的土坡上，在各个道口的树干上，刻写了“自力更生，克服困难，为超额完成党交给的烧炭任务而斗争！”“打倒日本帝国主义，解放全中国！”“毛主席万岁！”等标语。当我们感到疲倦时，一看到这些激动人心的口号，精神便立刻又振奋起来。
    一棵青棡树烧成木炭，要经过砍伐、打窑、烧窑、出窑、捆扎、背运等七八道工序。张思德同志在实践中，经过仔细琢磨，创造了一边砍伐，一边装窑点火，一边出窑的流水作业方法，并且在天黑收工时，让每个人随手背一包木炭下山，合理地组织了劳动力。对于每一道工序的技术，张思德同志一方面把自己的经验毫无保留地传授给大家，另一方面又继续钻研，虚心学习同志们的新经验。有一次我们烧了一窑特别好的炭，每根炭都是明光光、蓝油油的，好像上了层电光一样，敲起来当当作响，没有一点儿羊角把（指没有烧透的木炭），碎的也极少。出完窑他就让大家一边休息，一边讨论，为什么这一窑出的炭这么好？通过这次讨论，我们总结出了一套烧炭的好经验。张思德同志很注意节约。砍树时，他三番五次地提醒我们，要爱护幼苗，节省木料，炭烧好以后，总是叮嘱我们不要丢掉一根木炭，碎炭也不能丢。
    在紧张的劳动中，张思德同志总是走在前头。记得那时，一个人每天砍伐十七、八棵树就很可观了。可是张思德同志总是砍到二十多棵树。背炭时，别人一次背一包，他却是一次背两包。出窑是最紧张的时刻了，需要分秒必争。窑里温度很高，出慢一点，风一吹，整窑炭就会着火，化为灰烬。张思德同志常讲：“出窑时必须跟消灭敌人一样，动作要快！”而每逢出窑，张思德同志自己总是先迅速钻进窑去，并且工作得时间最长。出来时满身漆黑，衣服全被汗水湿透了。同志们开玩笑地说他发疟子了。
    天气一坏，张思德同志就担起心来。晚上，他根本睡不着觉，生怕雨水灌进烟囱，冲坏炭窑。有一次半夜下起了瓢泼大雨，张思德同志立即披上衣服，抄起铁锹，一口气跑到后沟，仔细检查炭窑。后来，我和申成兴同志赶到了，他已经检查完三个窑，见到我们，便亲切地责备说：“你们不好好睡觉，来做什么！这儿有一个人还不成啊！”我们把全部炭窑检查完了，一起回到宿舍，天已将亮。张思德同志进了门，看到有些同志把被子踹开了，急忙轻轻地给他们盖好，然后才躺下。天色发亮，他又照常和同志们一道上山。
    有一天，张思德同志发现学生出身的战士张民权的情绪不高，就问他怎么了。他说：“我砍的树少，粗的又扛不动，总落在大伙后头，自己心里别扭。”张思德同志了解以后，就鼓励他说：“明天，你就砍些细一点的树，好截又好扛。只要按照自己的体力努力干就行了，不要勉强，也不要不好意思。体力是逐渐锻炼出来的。”以后，张思德同志总是分配他做些比较轻的活儿；又根据他的特点，分配他做些宣传教育工作，教生字，写标语等等。这样一来，张民权的心情舒畅，工作搞得更好了。他说：“班长真会关心人！”这件事给了我很大的教育。本来一到土黄沟，张思德同志就再三叮嘱大家：“开始时，重活要少干，先磨炼一下，往后再一天天增加工作量。”并且一再告诉我：“要关心同志们的健康。”
    有一次我和申成兴等同志烧了一窑炭，打开一看，羊角把很多。我们感到十分难过，满以为这次非受批评不可。可是张思德同志看了以后，微笑着说：“一般说，烧得还不错。烧这么多窑，出现羊角把现象，总会有的。”而后，他帮助我们具体地分析了烧不透的原因。并且诚恳地检查说：“这一窑没烧好，主要应由我负责。”他一再鼓励我们：“不要怕，要继续烧下去，以后经验多了，就会好起来。”听了张思德同志的话，我们的情绪立刻又振奋起来。
    往山下背炭距离较长，大家都感到吃力。张思德同志看到这种情形，便拿起铁锨，在沿途搞了几个高台儿，让同志们中途休息。他还告诉大家，背炭时在背后垫些干草，以免磨坏肩膀。张思德同志想尽办法让同志们中途休息，可是他自己尽管每次都比我们背得多，却很少中途休息。
    对于同志政治上的进步，张思德同志更是非常关心。他见到同志的缺点和错误，总是诚恳地指出，耐心地帮助，可是他又不以教育者自居。他尊重同志，平等地看待每个同志，同志有意见，他总是让人家把话说完，虚心考虑。因此，大家都愿意和张思德同志一道工作。在烧炭时，我们班有个张翠华同志，表现不够好，同志们都嫌他落后，张思德同志却总是耐心地团结他。后来，张翠华同志转变了，感激地说：“这次多亏跟张思德同志在一起，不仅烧好了炭，也炼好了思想。”
    后来，张思德同志又带领我们两次去土黄沟烧炭。每次都是七月去，十月以后回来。两次都出色地完成了党交给我们的光荣任务，受到了上级的嘉奖。
    革命工作到处有
    张思德同志从来没有计较过个人得失，和他相处中，我从没有听见他有过什么个人要求，更没有看见他为个人什么事忧愁过。他时刻考虑着人民和同志们的疾苦，热情关心着战友们的成长。他处处为别人着想，对同志诚恳，热情，体贴入微。
    一九四一年夏天。一天中午，同志们已经睡午觉了。张思德同志正在埋头看书，营首长进来了，叫把一封急件送到三连。三连住在杨家岭，离我们有七、八里路。张思德同志没有叫醒别人，悄悄地拿上文件出发了。盛夏的晌午，烈日当空，照射在身上火辣辣的，延安的土道、山路，也被太阳晒得滚烫。张思德同志不顾这一切，快步向前跑去。到了杨家岭，已是汗如雨下，气喘吁吁。他进了连部，想拿文件交给三连首长。连首长们正睡午觉，他立刻想到，文件虽急，但我是跑步来的，还没到规定时间，等一会儿就起床了，让首长们多休息会吧。想到这里，他决意在外边等候。过了一会儿，他才把急件送进去。
    夏天，延河突然涨了大水。滚滚的河水，卷着泥沙，奔腾着，呼啸着，像是受了惊的马挣脱缰绳似的，猛烈地冲打着堤岸。张思德同志从外边执行任务回来，看见延河岸边的球场上还有一副篮球架子。“这是哪个单位的架子呢？一会儿，大水就要卷走它！不，不能让公家财产受到损失！”想到这里，他马上飞跑到班里，放下枪，叫上我们去抢救。当我们赶到，大水已经快冲到球场。刚抬起篮球架，大水到了。张思德同志连衣服也没有脱，纵身跳到水里，冒着生命危险，拖住篮球架子，一直顺水漂出好远，他才把球架抢救靠岸。在他的带动下，其他的同志也把另一个球架抢救上来。那时，我不会水，站在岸上，看着张思德同志的英勇行为，心情非常激动。我回想起在土黄沟烧炭时，他对我们说的一句话。那是他看见小河上的桥坏了，老乡们来往不方便，主动地带着我们去修理，他对我们讲：“革命工作到处有，可得自己主动去作。”
    “革命工作到处有，可得自己主动去作。”这里包含着多么崇高的革命责任感啊！正是在这种正确的思想指导下，不论环境多么艰苦，斗争多么紧张，张思德同志在完成了本职工作之后，有点空闲时间，就主动去找工作做。
    他一有空，就去帮助炊事班烧火、担水。他还经常给炊事员读报纸，教生字。炊事班里有位哑吧同志，是长征过来的。一见到张思德同志，他就翘起大拇指，表示夸奖。张思德同志也经常抽空帮助饲养员铡草，给他们读报，讲长征故事。饲养员同志们见到我们，常骄傲地说：“张思德，不但是你们的班长，也是我们的班长！”
    星期天，对张思德同志来说，是更加忙碌的日子。他不是帮助战士补衣服，打草鞋，便是帮助老乡下地干活。总之，他在星期天要做的工作太多了。夏天，蚊子特别多，大家没有蚊帐，晚上咬得睡不着。有的同志开玩笑说：“睡觉睡不好，蚊子到处咬，伸手抓一把，不知有多少。”张思德同志看到这种情形，星期天便上山拔了好多蒿子，拧成绳子，晒干了，供大家晚上点燃了熏蚊子。我们看见张思德同志总是闲不住地干，真有些心疼，常常劝他休息。他笑着说：“只做了这么点儿工作，算不了什么。就是再多干点儿也累不坏的。”
    那时，被子很少。开始时，两个人发一床被，后来，虽然每个人发一床，但是因为没有褥子，常常还是两人合作，铺一床，盖一床。我和张思德同志经常合盖一床被子。睡觉时，他总是给我多盖些，自己少盖些。被子脏了，他总是抢先拆洗。张思德同志常常给我们打草鞋，补衣服，织袜子。我们的脏衣服一脱下来，有时不见了，仔细寻找，才发现张思德同志已经洗得干干净净。有的同志病了，他照顾得比亲人还周到。有一次，有个同志病得起不了床，张思德同志每天热情地背着他去大小便。我们远离部队单独执行任务，张思德同志为了活跃大家的生活，还用土豆刻出梅花，红桃等扑克模子，印在桦树皮上，做成扑克牌，让大家娱乐。
    勤务班有个小同志叫刘和忠，不爱学习，工作也不怎么好，一有时间就抱着个篮球玩。张思德同志看到后，热情地劝告他好好工作，抓紧学习。不想，刘和忠却把脸一板，说：“你又不是我的班长，你管不着！”说着，头也不回便跑开了。的确，刘和忠同志在勤务班，张思德同志是通信班班长，是管不着他。张思德同志碰了钉子，并不介意。张思德同志了解到，刘和忠是家里最小的一个孩子，从小有些娇，便在生活上多接近他，工作上多影响他。早上，张思德同志帮助他打水；上山背柴，张思德同志又帮他捆柴；慢慢的和他交上了朋友。张思德同志和他谈心，耐心地教育他：“年青的时候，应该抓紧学习。学习好本领才能更好地为人民工作，将来也才能适应革命发展的需要。”张思德同志还从包袱里把自己精心保存了几年的笔记本送给了他。后来，刘和忠同志终于成了一个好同志、好战士。
    吃苦在前享受在后
    张思德同志的生活，十分艰苦朴素。他的棉衣已经破烂得几乎没法拆补了。大家都劝他领件新的。可是他说：“不用领，我拆补一下，还可以再穿两年。”后来，他费尽千针万线，补钉打补钉，还是把那件破棉衣拆补成了。并且果真又穿了两年。
    延安，都是土道和山路，石头很多，我们又时常外出执行任务，上山生产，因此，鞋子穿得很费。可是，每当发鞋时，他都不要。他说：“我会打草鞋。我少要一双鞋，老乡就可以减轻一双鞋的负担。”其实张思德同志的鞋，都是补了又补的。烂的地方，就垫些干草或树皮，凑合着穿。烂得实在不能穿了，他也舍不得丢掉，总是拆下来，洗净，晒干，加点破布条再打。为了省鞋，张思德同志经常赤着脚干活。他常常把自己破旧得不能再缝补的线袜子和别人扔掉的破袜子拆开、洗净，织好再穿，或者分送给同志们。
    张思德同志有个搪瓷碗，还是长征时带过来的。搪瓷几乎已经掉光，里外都是坑坑疤疤，破旧得不像样子，但是他还是舍不得丢掉。有一次，我们发了新搪瓷碗。他把新的送给了别的同志，自己依然使用那个旧的。张思德同志还有支很旧的自来水钢笔，笔尖已经又短又粗，写出的字几乎有毛笔字小楷那么大，他还是照常使用。笔尖太粗了，就自己磨一磨。他很爱惜这支笔，给钢笔做了个小布口袋。
    一九四一年至一九四二年，是敌后抗日根据地最困难的时期。那时我们吃粮都很困难，一个时期连小米也没有，只能吃到一些生了芽儿的麦子。从食堂打回来的饭，根本不够吃。张思德同志一看到大家不够吃，便拿起水桶出去打开水，实际上是借此躲开，好让同志们多吃些。他曾经对我说：“同志们参军不久，正是成长的时候，让他们多吃点，把身体搞好，好适应战斗的需要。我少吃点也一样。”吃的菜少，有时没有菜吃，张思德同志经常利用休息时间去挖野菜，采野果，或者打几只山鸡，想办法给大家改善生活。一个星期天，他跑出几十里，从一个有鱼的水坑里，捞了不少鱼。他拿回来，晒成鱼干，在火上烤了烤让大家“会”了顿“餐”。大家吃得很香，张思德同志照例又拿起水桶打水去了。
    对于张思德同志的这种艰苦朴素、先人后己的作风，我非常钦佩，常常问他：“你为什么总是这样省吃俭用，穿得缝缝补补的？”他解释说：“我过去的生活比现在苦得多；当上红军，我觉得生活幸福多了。”有时也这样回答：“现在比咱们穿得破烂的人还多得很，全国还有千千万万的劳动人民没有解放。革命也还非常困难，每个人都注意节约一点儿，就能为革命解决好大问题。再说咱们是共产党员，应该像毛主席教导的，吃苦在前，享受在后。咱们应当多想人民，多做工作，不要考虑个人生活。”张思德同志的艰苦朴素的作风和高度的阶级觉悟，给了我极深刻的印象。
    自己动手　丰衣足食
    一九四一年深秋，警卫营开到了南泥湾。我们响应毛主席的号召：自己动手，丰衣足食。在这里，我们要向荒山要粮，以便战胜由于日本帝国主义和国民党反动派经济封锁造成的严重困难。
    南泥湾离延安九十多里，周围全是高山，山下只有极少数人家。刚到南泥湾，我们没有住处。张思德同志领着我们用树枝搭起了三角棚，割些野草当做铺草，晚上大家挤在棚子里睡觉，一躺下就能看见星星。当时吃的更是困难，根本没有菜吃，用盐水下饭，盐也很缺。他常对我们讲：“现在咱们虽然没有住处，没有菜吃，可是有了敬爱的领袖毛主席的正确领导，什么困难都能克服。”南泥湾的气温要比延安低得多。虽然才是深秋，可是夜晚已感到寒气逼人。为了过冬，部队首长要求各个连队尽快住进窑洞。张思德同志打窑是个内行，成了我们的技术指导员。他领着我们选好地形，动手打窑。当时打窑的工具，除了镢头是从延安带来的以外，小车、土筐等等都是自己动手制作的。南泥湾山坡上的土都是红胶泥土，非常硬，镢头抡下去，“咚咚”作响，震得双手生疼。张思德同志不停地抡着镢头，手上磨出血泡也不肯休息。同志们夺过他的镢头，他就驾起手车推土。遇到土块很大，车推不动，他便让我们把土块抬到他背上，他背着扔到沟里去。洞口打出以后，他抢先钻进洞里工作。天气逐渐冷了，可是张思德同志光着膀子干活，还浑身是汗。汗水和胶土结合在一起，紧紧地粘在身上，收工时，张思德同志变成了泥人。
    在南泥湾，除了茂密的原始森林之外，山地上长满一大片一大片的狼牙刺，开荒就选择这些地方。我们把狼牙刺丛砍倒，然后点上火，顷刻间，满山烟火，迎风呼啸。风火过去，现出漆黑的平地。我们再翻出肥沃的黄土，进行耕种。我们的工具很简陋，每人只有一把镢头，要跟荒山搏斗，非常困难。张思德同志经常鼓动我们：“开荒生产，多打粮食，不但为了改善生活，更重要的是，咱们积极响应毛主席号召，自己动手，自给自足，战胜敌人的经济封锁。”张思德同志不但这样讲，而且认真做。他用的镢头，是别人挑剩下的一把，可是开荒地时，谁也比不过他。开荒的第一天，张思德同志就超过上级规定的指标，受到首长的表扬。我深深体会到：张思德同志的革命意志非常坚决，这使他具有一种顽强的毅力，成为一副“钢筋铁骨”。有这样好的班长走在前头，谁不斗志昂扬呢！每天，天刚亮，我们就上山开荒，满山遍谷都响着镢头破土的声音。真是人勤地不懒，这一年庄稼长得十分茁壮，我们赢得了大丰收。
    后来，我们又奉命到南泥湾东边的孟家酒地方开荒生产。这里，除了原始山林，还有很多陷人的沼泽，长满了芦草，我们又住进用树枝搭的草棚里。有一天，半夜下了大雨，张思德同志马上把自己的被子张开给大家挡雨。可是雨下个不停，我们都披上被子可还是不成，大家都淋得像落汤鸡，身体弱的同志更是冷得哆嗦不停。后来，还是张思德同志想了个办法，叫我们拿起铁锹，每个人靠山坡挖个能避雨的地方，大家躲进去，天再下什么也不怕了。当时，我们除了完成正式生产任务以外，为了给抽烟的同志解决问题，还利用业余时间，种了些旱烟叶。种烟叶非常麻烦，除了浇水，还必须灌粪上肥，打枝掐杈。张思德同志是不吸烟的，但他总是挽起裤脚，光着脚，抢着挑粪，给烟叶施肥。
    拣重担子挑
    我和张思德同志是在通信班工作，那时，做通信工作根本没有现代化的交通工具。送信和传达命令，只能靠两条腿，急件，我们就跑步迅速送去。
    在通信工作中，张思德同志一向拣重担子挑，不折不扣地坚决完成任务。有一天后半夜，正下着大雨，首长叫我们送一封急信到桥儿沟去（桥儿沟是当时鲁迅艺术学院的所在地）。张思德同志送信回来不久，这次该别的同志去了。但是他考虑到：任务紧急，道路泥泞，便决定自己去送。他拿上信，背上枪就走。从我们的驻地北沟桥到桥儿沟，有十五、六里地，要滑下山坡，越过清凉山，路过东关抗日军政大学门口和延安飞机场。窑洞多在半山腰，因此，到了桥儿沟，还得要再攀上一道道的大小石砭。张思德同志冒着雨，摸着黑，高一步低一步的，急促地向前走。雨越下越大，信淋湿了怎么办？张思德同志想到这里，连忙拿出夹在腋下的鞋子，把信装到里面，两只鞋一扣，正好把信包住。他及时地把信送到了桥儿沟。后来，我们听桥儿沟的同志们讲起，张思德同志保护文件的巧妙办法，大家都钦佩得哈哈大笑。
    还有一次，是一年的冬天。天刚亮，空中飞舞着鹅毛大雪，凛冽的西北风吼个不停。首长命令把一封急件送到小砭沟去。我们四连的一排住在那里。张思德同志穿着一身旧棉衣，戴着一顶旧毡帽，脚上穿着三年前发给他的一双破棉鞋，迎着风雪出发了。经过王家坪、延河、大砭沟、中央党校，大石砭很难走。等他完成任务回来，我们看见他全身上下都结了一层薄薄的冰霜，连眉毛上也有，毡帽冻成了钢盔，两只手也冻僵了。同志们关切地问他：“很冷吧？”他微笑着说：“天再冷，也冻不住咱们革命战士的心！”
    我们在南泥湾开荒生产，照常坚持通信工作。为了保证生产、工作两不误，张思德同志常常废寝忘食。记得有一天半夜，首长叫把一件紧急命令传达到各个连队。那天白天打了一天窑洞，大家都累得很。张思德同志看同志们睡得正香，自己背上枪就出发了。我和他合盖一床被子，发觉以后，马上起来，想替他去，他怎么也不肯。
    在孟家酒开荒时，有一天深夜，我们往南泥湾送信。孟家酒距南泥湾有二十里路，中间是一片林海，只有一条小路，常常有豹子出没。白天，一个人进去都觉得阴森。为了保证安全，首长便让我和张思德同志一道去。走的时候，我对他说：“听老乡说，这个地方豹子很多，……”。张思德同志泰然地说：“没有什么可怕的，比起过草地来算不了什么。那时候，前前后后都有比豹子还凶的国民党反动军队和地方的反革命团队。”张思德同志的大无畏的精神立刻感染了我。虽然只有二十里路，却要跨过十几道弯弯曲曲的小河。遇到水宽的地方，张思德同志就不让我下水，把我背过河去。当我们完成任务，回到孟家酒时，天已大亮，同志们都下地生产了。张思德同志让我好好休息，他却乘我入睡悄悄地溜出去，同大家一道锄地去了。我一翻身，发现张思德同志不在，也急忙下地去干活。
    有一年夏天，为了改善部队生活，司务长在洛河川买了五头猪。领导上派我和张思德同志一道去把猪赶回来。洛河川距延安有七、八十里，我们带上干粮就出发了。傍晚，到达了洛河川。我们本来可以住上一宿，但是张思德同志说：“赶猪，最好在晚上走。天凉快，猪听话。今天晚上还有月亮，咱们走吧！”我说：“好。”于是我们便赶着猪上了路。开始，猪还很听话，一直往前走。走出几十里之后，遇到一条小河，猪怎么也不敢上桥，总想往河里跑。张思德同志试了试，水不很深，便说：“猪不肯过桥，干脆咱们俩和猪一起洗个澡也好。”我们挽起裤腿儿，他在前边叫，我在后边赶，猪立即欢欢喜喜地跟着下河了。谁知，它们顺水玩开了，一直往下游了好几里，怎么赶也不出来。这下子，我们可急坏了。张思德同志想了想，马上脱下军装裤子，结住裤脚，灌满了水，变成了个水怪。猪，顿时吓得拚命往岸上跑。看到这种情形，我笑得肚子都疼了。上岸以后，我说：“你的办法真多！”他顺口说：“干什么，就得想什么办法。不然把猪冲走了，这个政治任务就完不成了。”我听了很诧异：“赶个猪，也算是政治任务？”张思德同志严肃地说：“凡是党和上级交给咱们的工作，不论什么任务，咱们都应该当作政治任务去完成。比方，这次如果猪跑了，咱们受批评不要紧，更重要的是大家吃不上肉，影响了生活，怎么能保卫好党中央和毛主席呢！”
    和群众打成一片
    张思德同志每到一个地方，都同当地的群众打成一片，建立最密切的联系。在烧炭时，我们住在一个姓马的老乡家里。每天，张思德同志都帮助老乡扫院子、担水、喂牛。有时间，他还帮着哄孩子，好让大人多做点家务事。有一次，我们会餐，每人只有很少的一些猪肉，他还舍不得吃，留了一半送给老乡的小孩。每逢星期天，他都带着我们下地，帮助老乡干活。锄地时，他又快又细。收割时，地上丢一支谷穗，他也要拣回来。姓马的老乡，看见就夸：“你们班长，真是好样的！烧炭那么累，还来帮助我们干这干那，真是毛主席教育出来的好战士啊！”当我们完成任务，返回延安时，老乡们都送到村口，依依不舍地说：“老张同志，以后再来呀！”“同志们，可别忘记再来呀！”张思德同志诚挚地回答：“你们有事到延安，可要到部队找我们啊！”后来，那位姓马的老乡到延安时，果真来部队找张思德同志。老乡热情地说：“我们全村都想念着你们。我那个小孩还常说：‘要找张叔叔玩’呢！”张思德同志热情地接待了老乡。
    张思德同志所以同群众建立起密切的联系，最根本的是处处以群众利益为重，把群众的事情看作比自己的事情还重要。一九四○年深秋，我们在土黄沟紧张地从山上往下背炭。有一次，张思德同志背起很大的一捆木炭，正往山下走，迎面来了一头毛驴，驮着很多的东西。毛驴一见他背着炭，不知怎的，突然惊住。张思德同志怕把毛驴惊跑，老乡受到损失，连忙后退，找个地方躲了起来。待毛驴走过，赶驴的老乡走近张思德同志的身边，连声道谢：“同志，谢谢你啦！”张思德同志回答说：“这是我应该做的。”还有一次，有个同志背一包木炭，走在路上，绳子断了，压坏了农民的几根老玉米。张思德同志当即批评：“为什么不小心一点呢！你看，老乡这几根老玉米要经过多少辛勤劳动啊！毛主席教导咱们要爱护农民的一草一木。”后来，张思德同志亲自跑去向老乡道歉。晚上，又召开班务会，检查原因，吸取教训。从此，背炭时，我们都互相检查，看看木炭捆得结实不结实，没问题再背起来走。
    我们在南泥湾开荒，有一次我和张思德同志去老乡家借锄头。一进院子，老大爷和老大娘正在铡草。张思德同志连忙走过去说：“大娘，你歇歇，让我来。”说着就接过铡刀铡起来。我也连忙去递草。老大娘看着我们，笑咪咪地说：“你们在延安见过毛主席没有？”我们回答：“见过。”“毛主席是咱们的救星啊！”老大娘感慨地说：“不是毛主席领导着八路军住在延安，我们这里哪太平得了啊！这南泥湾，过去国民党和土匪可多着呢！自打毛主席来了以后，我们这里才过起太平的生活。”张思德同志马上接过去说：“是啊！这次我们部队就是奉毛主席的命令，来到这里开荒生产的，我们要把南泥湾建设得跟江南一样，打倒日本帝国主义和彻底粉碎国民党反动派的封锁。在毛主席的教导下，我们还要使全国人民都得到彻底的解放，同咱们陕甘宁人民一样不受压迫和剥削。”老大娘高兴地说：“那可好啦！”张思德同志总是抓紧机会，通俗地向群众宣传党的政策，宣传前线打胜仗的消息。回到班里，张思德同志又把老大娘的话讲给大家听。他说：“咱们是人民的子弟兵，处处要同人民打成一片。拿起枪，咱们是军队；放下枪，咱们就是农民。咱们要记住毛主席的教导：人民军队同人民是鱼水不能分离的。”
    为革命学习
    张思德同志经常劝我们说：“要看得远些，看到将来。咱们的革命事业一天天在发展，将来还要到共产主义呢！将来，革命需要咱们做更多的工作。咱们一定要抓紧时间学习，不学习就要落后啊！”
    他这样劝告着别人，也如此要求着自己。不管是上山烧炭，开荒生产，抢修工事，还是在家值勤，也不管是多么累，只要一有空儿，他就坚持学习，学文化，读报纸，念政治课本。出外生产时，一休息，他就拿根木棒在地上练习写字。回到家里，吃了饭他又在自己做的沙盘上写着生字。
    那时学习条件很差，边区几乎没有纸张，没有铅笔。不但是最困难时期是这样，就是大生产运动开展以后，缺少纸和笔的问题也没有彻底解决。那时，谁要是能拣到一些旧书本、旧报纸写字，就不知有多么高兴。谁要有个像样子的学习本，或一支铅笔，就比什么都珍贵。上级曾经奖给张思德同志几本笔记本，几支铅笔，他舍不得用，紧紧地包在包袱里。条件困难，并没有阻碍张思德同志学习。我们到土黄沟烧炭时，他发现很多桦树，便用桦树皮订了一些笔记本。张思德同志还用旧铁盒，剪了个钢笔尖，找根木棒绑在一起，当蘸水钢笔用。后来，他又想办法用旧子弹壳制造了一种新式钢笔。教员上文化课，或者指导员上政治课时，张思德同志总是先用笔在地上画写，画熟了，再用铅笔抄到桦树皮的笔记本上。当时灯油很困难，只发很少的一点，晚上没法学习。张思德便砍些柏树枝当蜡烛点。我们收割完大麻子以后，他又到地里拣些掉下的大麻子，把它串起来，也当蜡烛点。再不然，他就利用月光读书写字。
    张思德同志从小就给地主作活，旧社会剥夺了他读书的权利，参军时一个字也不认识。在党的培养教育下，他自己顽强地学习，在我们相处的时候，他已经能够向上级写一般的报告，代同志们写家信了。
    那时，我们班的多数同志都比张思德同志年纪小，包括我在内，一有空就贪玩，学习抓不紧。张思德同志总是苦口婆心地说服我们抓紧学习。记得有一次有的同志讲，学习连个桌子也没有，真不方便。张思德同志就说：“咱们每人不是都有自动桌子吗？”说着，他就坐下来，在自己两个膝盖上写起字来，引得大家哈哈大笑。一次，欢庆“五一”节时，他对我们说：“今年，咱们在延安庆祝‘五一’，将来，咱们还不知要到什么大城市去庆祝‘五一’呢！革命事业要发展，需要咱们作更多的工作。咱们可得抓紧时间学习啊！”张思德同志自己的文化虽然不高，但他还是尽自己的力量帮助大家学习。早晚一有空儿，就教同志们读生字，写生字，或者读政治课本、《解放日报》。起初，我的学习劲头不大，他就批评我：“你连自己的名字都不会写还成啊！要知道，有了文化才能看报，才能懂得更多的革命道理。”并且还握着我的手教我写“陈耀”两个字。为了使我有更多的学习时间，他经常代我出差。张思德同志还组织班里文化比较高点儿的几个同志辅导我们学习。后来，我们班终于形成了学习热潮，经常出现三人一堆儿，两人一伙儿地读报纸，写生字，学政治课本的新景象。我自己就是用张思德同志送给的桦树皮本子、半支铅笔、一支木笔摘掉文盲帽子的。现在回忆起来，实在惋惜，那时我学得太不够了。
    好好当个战士
    一九四二年冬，我们从南泥湾调回延安。不久，有一天营首长把张思德同志和我叫去了。教导员淳杰同志说：“这个班，你们领导得不错。不论从战士们的政治思想情况看，还是从完成任务情况看，都很好。这次根据上级指示，咱们部队要整编为中共中央警卫团。你们这个班要分配到各个连队去。你们有什么意见？”张思德同志回答：“根据党的需要嘛，我们没有意见。”教导员又说：“整编以后，班长和副班长不需要那么多了。你们俩回到班里当战士，怎么样？”张思德同志马上愉快地回答：“坚决服从组织分配。组织让干什么，也是为人民服务。我一定好好当个战士。”我也表示服从组织分配。
    第二天，张思德同志照例起得很早，给同志们打好洗脸水，就打起自己的背包来。他把一床又破又小的被子打在背包里，把我们两人合盖了三年的一床大点的被子留给了我。从南泥湾，我们带回一块草垫子和一块黄羊皮。他给我留下黄羊皮，自己带走草垫子。他知道我不会打草鞋，又爱打篮球，便从包袱里拿出仅有的一双新草鞋送给了我。为了鼓励同志们继续学习，他从包袱里取出了前几年上级奖给他的几本笔记本，送给了申成兴等同志。吃过早饭，我们俩背起背包，扛着草垫子去连队报到。路上，他对我说：“咱们俩在一起工作几年，配合得很好。这次上级决定你我都当战士，你到底有没有意见？”我说：“没意见，服从组织分配，叫干什么就干什么。”他很满意，接着说：“对，做什么工作，都是为党工作，都是为了人民的利益。”他还再三叮嘱我要继续学习文化，克服遇事急躁的毛病。
    从此以后，我们不在一起了，但是还在一个团里，经常见面，他还像过去一样关心我。在连队里，不论是站岗放哨，还是值勤生产，他都干得很出色，实现了自己的保证：“好好当个战士”。
    一九四四年，组织上又决定派他上山烧炭。临行前，他特地找到我，关切地说：“这次咱们俩搭不上伙计了。你在家里要好好工作，努力学习。”他问我：“这些日子，你的工作、学习怎么样？有什么困难吗？”我回答说：“平常。”他摇摇头，说：“那还行！今后可不能再说这样的话。”当时，我惭愧地低下头。“平常”，这个标准的确太低了。一个革命战士怎么能这样要求自己呢？他又问我缺点克服得怎样。我回答说：“有所克服。”他又是摇摇头，尔后耐心地和严肃地说：“不能说有所克服；对于自己的缺点和毛病，应当坚决克服。要按毛主席的指示办事，天天洗脸，天天扫地。不然，尘土多了，就坏了！”他还叮嘱我：“你要抓紧学习文化，学着写报告，写家信，我给你带来一个日记本、一支铅笔。以后，我可不再代替你写信了。有什么困难，写信告诉我。”那次，我们谈了许久。他还鼓励我努力工作，好好帮助周围的同志。最后他紧紧地握着我的双手告别。我心里感激他的亲切关怀。但又说不出话来，只有等他回来时，用更好的成绩向他汇报。可是，万万没想到，这竟是我们之间最后的一次谈话。
    永远活在人民心里
    一九四四年九月五日，张思德同志在安塞县烧炭时，炭窑崩塌，不幸牺牲了。恶耗传来，我顿时万分悲痛。张思德，多么好的同志啊！他对党对人民事业一贯忠心耿耿，对党交给的任何工作都兢兢业业，认真地完成。他，革命意志坚强，在困难面前始终坚定、乐观，情绪饱满。他彻底地为人民利益工作，从来不计较个人得失。他，无微不至地关心同志，爱护同志，帮助同志。他，始终吃苦在前，享受在后，埋头苦干，以身作则。他，艰苦朴素，刻苦学习，谦虚谨慎，严格律己。他在各个方面都给我树立了榜样，都给了我巨大的帮助。这样好的亲密战友竟忽然和我永别了！往事涌向心头，眼泪不由地夺眶而出。在最初的几天里，我终日沉浸在悲痛中，一有人提及张思德同志，我的眼睛便立刻润湿起来。
    九月八日下午，在延安枣园前沟西山脚下面，同志们为张思德同志举行了追悼大会。会场上摆满了各机关用野花编成的花圈。敬爱的领袖毛主席亲笔写了挽词：“向为人民利益而牺牲的张思德同志致敬”。中央机关和我们部队共一千多人参加了大会，毛主席在会上发表了著名的讲演：《为人民服务》。毛主席的话给我指出了方向。我决心化悲痛为力量，永远发扬张思德同志的革命精神，彻底地为党和人民利益工作。
    张思德同志牺牲已经二十二年了。这些年来，不论是在艰苦的战争年代，还是在和平的建设时期，张思德同志的伟大的共产主义精神始终在鼓舞着我，鞭策着我。每当我想起张思德同志的时候，我便感到全身充满了力量。全国解放以后，我常常根据党和毛主席的教导，以张思德同志作榜样，要求着自己。张思德同志永远活在我的心里，永远活在全国人民的心里。（原载《解放军报》，本报略有改动）
