On August 25, as dawn broke, a small Red Guard detachment marched along the road from Dalian to Beijing. Shouldering their backpacks, they sang battle songs, striding forward with heads held high.

At the head of the column, a warrior held aloft a radiant red flag, which shimmered in the bright morning sun with golden letters: "Dalian-Beijing Long March Red Guard."

This Long March Red Guard detachment was composed of fifteen students from the Ship and Electrical Engineering Class of 1961 at the Dalian Maritime Institute.

Not long ago, they received orders to go to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. Overjoyed and excited, they yearned to fly to the side of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao! However, they did not rush to set out. Instead, they considered how to make this once-in-a-lifetime activity more meaningful. Some of them, looking at the photo of the great leader Chairman Mao in military uniform receiving millions of revolutionary masses on August 18, recalled the scene of the Red Army's arduous journey of 25,000 li. They thought: To achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must have both the fearless revolutionary spirit and the iron will of a revolutionary. In this great revolution that touches people's souls, one must learn and carry forward the Long March spirit of the old Red Army, and cultivate and foster the style of the People's Liberation Army of enduring hardships and hard work. They proposed a bold initiative: to march on foot to Beijing!

The day before their departure, they raised high their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and swore with revolutionary fervor:

To make a revolution, one must dare to take the most arduous path!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must temper oneself into a stalwart of the proletarian revolution!

		The mountains and rivers are but trifles.

The Long March Red Guard took their first steps on the march, and difficulties immediately arose.

For the first ten days of the march, it rained continuously, and the weather was humid and hot. The rain soaked their clothes, and sweat drenched their bodies, making it very difficult to walk.

At this time, they took out their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from their pockets, reading as they walked: "With firm resolve, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, surmounting every obstacle, and striving for victory."

After a few days, everyone's feet were blistered, and their ankles were red and swollen, making it painful to walk with each step.

At this time, they recited Chairman Mao's great poems as they marched forward: "The Red Army fears no difficulties in the long march, the mountains and rivers are but trifles. The sky is high and the clouds are thin, looking for the southbound geese in vain. One is not a hero until one reaches the Great Wall."

On the most arduous days of the march, the advance scouts wrote Chairman Mao's quotations by the roadside to encourage the team forward; everyone sang "We Love Chairman Mao" over and over, encouraging each other and pressing onward. Some even pointed to the mileage markers by the roadside, patting their companions on the shoulder and saying, "We are twenty li closer to Chairman Mao!"

Mao Zedong Thought is power! What are wind and rain? What is pain? The young warriors, imitating the style of the old Eighth Route Army, punctured their blisters with strands of hair, applied plasters to their ankles, and continued to march forward with heads held high and steps firm. Along the way, countless cars and carts passed by, with drivers and drivers-in-chief enthusiastically inviting them to ride, but they all politely declined.

On September 21, the Long March Red Guard set out from Caoting Bridge in Yutian County, Hebei, and walked to Sanhe County, a distance of 120 li. This was their 27th consecutive day of marching, and also the longest day of their journey. For every member of the Long March Red Guard, this day was a severe test.

Li Zengwen's left ankle was already red and swollen. In the morning, he used a crutch to keep up with the team, walking over forty li. In the afternoon, his right ankle also swelled, making it even more difficult to walk. To ensure that no one in the team was left behind, everyone urged him to walk at the head of the team. He thought: I cannot delay the team's arrival at the campsite because of my slow pace! Gritting his teeth, he had to speed up!

At this time, Chairman Mao's warm instructions echoed in his ears: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight bravely, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and engaging in continuous battles (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)."

At this time, the encouragement of his comrades resonated in his ears: "Persist! Persist! With each step, we are one step closer to Beijing, one step closer to Chairman Mao!"

He firmly told himself: "It hurts, it hurts, but the pain is nothing compared to the strength Chairman Mao gives me!" He leaned on his crutch, stood tall, and took big strides, marching towards Chairman Mao at a speed of twelve li per hour.

Thus, these young revolutionaries in the Long March Red Guard, under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought and the encouragement of their lofty desire to see Chairman Mao, overcame the various difficulties of marching on foot with a fearless spirit. They crossed mountains and rivers, advancing towards the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the holy land of world revolution—Beijing—at an average speed of eighty to ninety li per day.

These revolutionary youths wrote in their "Long March Declaration": "Our Long March is a declaration." With their actual actions, they declared to the world: The Red Guards and revolutionary youths of the Mao Zedong era are heroes, unafraid of hardship and unafraid of death. For the revolution, they dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire!

A Classroom of Class Struggle

The Long March Red Guard marched from Dalian to Beijing, passing through four cities and seventeen counties in Liaoning and Hebei, covering a distance of over 2,000 li. This 2,000-li journey was a great furnace for cultivating a spirit of hard struggle and a great classroom for raising political awareness.

Along the way, they cherished deep feelings for this great school without classrooms or laboratories, eagerly learning things that could not be learned in the classroom.

In the Long March Red Guard, there were two comrades who went ahead to make arrangements. They were responsible for arranging food and lodging along the way, but their more important task was to gather educational materials, find learning objects, and arrange for participation in productive labor.

Sometimes, after a day of marching, everyone was already very tired, but when they learned that the advance comrades had arranged for a meeting with old poor peasants, they all rushed to the venue with high spirits and vigor. They said: We can go without food, we can sleep less, but we must not miss the opportunity to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants.

In Caozhuang Commune, Xingcheng County, the Long March Red Guard warriors learned that there was a thirteen-year-old activist named Zhou Hua who was enthusiastic about studying Chairman Mao's works. They seized the time before their departure the next day, inviting Zhou Hua early in the morning to share his learning experiences. This young warrior had been studying Chairman Mao's works since 1964, continuously raising his political awareness, and had done many good deeds for the collective and the Five Guarantees households over the past two years. The Long March Red Guard warriors listened and took notes, and many expressed on the spot: We are older than him, but we are not as good as him in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the future, we must learn from this young warrior, study diligently, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

Along the way, they saw Mao Zedong's portraits hanging in every village and household, and quotations from Chairman Mao posted everywhere. How many times, as they marched in formation, the villagers working in the fields, upon learning that they were going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, would gather around. The first words of these villagers were: "When you see Chairman Mao, be sure to give him our regards and wish him eternal life!" Some people sent them off for one more stretch, and as they parted, they sang "The East Is Red" loudly and repeatedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The workers of the Lu Long County People's Printing Plant, knowing that they needed to print propaganda materials, did not eat or sleep, working through the night to typeset and print for them until dawn. The workers said: We are proud and honored to be able to contribute to the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

The workers and poor peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao and their limitless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought deeply educated the Long March Red Guard warriors. They said: The workers and poor peasants have a deeper class sentiment for Chairman Mao. We must learn from the workers and poor peasants, first of all, to learn their class sentiment.

The Long March Red Guard also witnessed the great power of Mao Zedong Thought along the way, seeing the broad masses of commune members actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their struggle to change heaven and earth, producing tremendous material strength.

In Jin County's Ershili Pu, it was originally a severely water-scarce mountainous area. Some bourgeois "experts" had once declared that water could not be found here. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants repeatedly studied "Moving Mountains," determined: Even if we drill through the earth, we must find water! Now, wells tens of zhang deep are continuously irrigating the farmland, and the grain yield per mu has increased more than twofold. The Long March Red Guard warriors deeply felt from numerous such vivid and moving examples: Once the laboring people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can create any miracle!

The Long March Red Guard also visited some revolutionary sites along the way. One noon, they came to the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower at Tashan, where they asked the management to introduce the heroic deeds of the famous blockade battle during the War of Liberation. They stood before the memorial tower, solemnly swearing to the martyrs: "We, the 'Long March Red Guard,' will follow in your footsteps, take up your guns, continue the fight, and complete your unfinished tasks. To ensure that our great motherland remains unchanged for thousands of generations, to build and defend the iron fortress of the proletariat, we are ready to endure countless hardships, sacrifice everything, and forever follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution!"

These revolutionary youths wrote in their "Long March Declaration": "Our Long March is a pilgrimage." Indeed, they obtained many "true scriptures" along the way that they could not see in school. They proudly said: Although we left the bright classrooms, comfortable beds, and superior living conditions, and abandoned convenient means of transportation, we have achieved a great liberation, tempering, and elevation in our thoughts.

A Red Propaganda Team

The Long March Red Guard warriors, following Chairman Mao's instructions, stipulated in their "Long March Declaration" that their Long March is a propaganda team. Wherever they went, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the Party Central Committee's Sixteen Points.

They posted Chairman Mao's quotations along the way and distributed leaflets propagating Mao Zedong Thought. In the fields, by the villages, under the lamps, by the stoves, during rest stops, and while working with the masses, they took out their "Quotations from Chairman Mao," opened the Sixteen Points, and read them to the masses.

One day, they walked eighty li and arrived at Zhuangwo Brigade, Wangdianzi Commune, Luan County, at five o'clock in the afternoon. They saw many commune members sitting in the courtyard peeling corn, thinking it was a good opportunity to do propaganda work, so they quickly finished their meal and rushed to work with the commune members. At this time, it was already late, so they read Chairman Mao's quotations, the Sixteen Points, and People's Daily editorials by flashlight, propagating for three hours while working. The commune members were deeply moved, and many praised, saying: You are truly propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought!

The Long March Red Guard also propagated with their actual actions, allowing the masses along the way to see the excellent style of the youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Everywhere they went, they cleaned the courtyards according to the spirit of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention formulated by Chairman Mao, ensuring the water jars were full. They squeezed out time to help the masses with the autumn harvest and odd jobs, doing countless good deeds along the way.

When crossing the Fuzhou River, there was no bridge or boat, and an old woman was sitting by the shore, worried. At this time, the Long March Red Guard warriors were already very tired, but thinking of Chairman Mao's instructions on serving the people wholeheartedly, two of them still went up without hesitation, one carrying the old woman and the other supporting her, escorting the old woman across the river. The river was wide, and the bottom was full of stones. Both of them had many blisters on their feet, and the water and stone points pierced their skin, causing intense pain. They silently recited Chairman Mao's teachings in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," persevering to carry the old woman across the fifty-meter-wide water surface.

On September 22, the Long March Red Guard arrived in Tong County. At this time, they had been marching continuously for nearly a month. They did not first consider resting but requested from the county people's committee production office to go to the commune to participate in labor. The county comrades, seeing their enthusiasm, did not stop them but only explained when issuing the introduction letter that they had traveled a long distance and were very tired, hoping they would be taken care of during labor. They arrived at the production team but told the commune members: "If you want to take care of us, let us do the heavy work!" They harvested corn and pulled beans with the commune members, each one like a little tiger.

All this deeply moved the broad masses along the way. Many praised them as "loyal little red guards of Chairman Mao," "red descendants of the old Red Army and Eighth Route Army."

He Huosheng, an elderly man over seventy from Fengyun County, saw the actions of the revolutionary young warriors and recalled his days as an underground courier during the War of Resistance Against Japan, distributing revolutionary leaflets at the risk of his life, and remembered the excellent style of the Eighth Route Army in those days. The old man patted the young warriors on the shoulder, excitedly saying: "You are actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought and seriously following Chairman Mao's instructions. You are doing the right thing, doing it well! I have great confidence in you, and you will surely carry on the revolutionary cause!"

Seeing the Red Sun They Yearned for Day and Night

On October 1, 1966, this great day will forever be etched in the hearts of all the warriors of the Long March Red Guard. On this day, they finally saw the red sun they yearned for day and night—the great leader Chairman Mao.

The night before was a sleepless night.

The fifteen warriors of the Long March Red Guard had surging thoughts, tossing and turning.

Sun Fengqi, born into a family of hired laborers for generations, recalled his father's bitter years in the old society, working as a long-term laborer for landlords, being beaten by landlords, and being forced to separate from his wife and children to flee to the Northeast. It was the beloved Chairman Mao who saved his family from the pit of fire, and it was Chairman Mao who enabled him to enter university!

Zhang Huai Fa remembered the scene in the liberated area orphanage where he first shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and first sang "Chairman Mao is the Great Savior." One year during the Spring Festival, the teacher gave them new cotton-padded clothes and told them: "This is given by Chairman Mao." At that time, he had no relatives, and he felt that Chairman Mao was his only relative. For many years, he had yearned to see his savior Chairman Mao!

Countless bitter and sweet memories surged into his heart, and his long-cherished wish was about to be fulfilled. How could he sleep? Some lay down and then got up again, wrote a few lines in their diary, read a few lines from Chairman Mao's quotations, always resenting that the sky was too slow to brighten.

The happy day finally arrived. On this day, team leader Li Longfu represented the Long March Red Guard and ascended the Tiananmen Gate. He stood by Chairman Mao's side for over an hour. In this most unforgettable hour, he felt that the hot blood of more than ten classmates, which had been infused into his body a year ago when he was seriously injured, was still boiling. He called out softly again and again: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I wish you eternal life!" At 12:28, he marched in formation with his Red Guard comrades past Chairman Mao, receiving the inspection of the great leader. He quickly wrote down this happiest moment in his "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

On this day, seven of their comrades ascended the reviewing stand. When Chairman Mao walked to the sides of the Tiananmen Gate and waved to them affectionately, a warm current of happiness instantly spread throughout their bodies. They shouted with all their might, again and again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!"

The other seven comrades participating in the parade held high their radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," cheering as they passed by Chairman Mao. Despite the slight soreness in their knee joints and the redness and swelling of their ankles after marching over 2,000 li, they marched with especially brisk steps in the parade. The fatigue of a month of marching on foot became a joyful memory. They expressed to the great leader:

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are not afraid of any difficulties and obstacles, determined to follow you and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, determined to follow you and march forward bravely on the ten-thousand-li journey to communism!

    我们的队伍向太阳
    ——记步行两千里来京进行革命串连的海运学院“长征红卫队”
    八月二十五日天刚破晓，在大连通向北京的公路上，有一支红卫兵小分队，肩挎背包，高唱战歌，雄赳赳气昂昂地行进着。
    走在队伍最前面的战士，举着一面光采夺目的红旗，在明亮的朝阳下闪耀着几个金黄的大字：“大连—北京长征红卫队”。
    这支长征红卫队是由大连海运学院船电六一级十五名学生组成的。
    不久以前，他们接到赴京串连的通知，一个个欣喜若狂，万分激动，多么想一下子就飞到党中央和毛主席身边啊！
    可是，他们却没有急于动身，他们考虑的是怎样使这次终生难忘的活动更有意义。他们当中有的人，看着伟大领袖毛主席在八月十八日身穿军装接见百万革命群众的照片，想起红军跋涉万水千山二万五千里长征的情景。他们想：要取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，既要有大无畏的革命精神，又要有钢铁般的革命毅力。在这场触及人们灵魂的大革命中，需要学习和发扬老红军的长征精神，需要锻炼和培养解放军的吃大苦、耐大劳的作风。他们提出了一个大胆的倡议：步行到北京去！
    出发的前一天，他们把鲜红的《毛主席语录》本高高地举起，满怀革命豪情地宣誓：
    干革命，就要敢于走最艰苦的道路！
    在文化大革命中，就要把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命的硬骨头！
    万水千山只等闲
    长征红卫队踏上征途的第一步，困难就接踵而至。
    行军的头十天，阴雨连绵，气候闷热。雨水打湿了衣服，汗水浸透了全身，行走十分吃力。
    这时候，他们从怀里掏出《毛主席语录》，边走边读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    几天走下来，个个脚上磨起了血泡，脚脖子又红又肿，走起路来一步一痛。
    这时候，他们一边前进一边朗诵毛主席的伟大诗句：“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲。”“天高云淡，望断南飞雁。不到长城非好汉”。
    在行军最艰苦的日子，打前站的同志在路旁写上毛主席语录，鼓舞着队伍前进；大家一遍又一遍地唱起《我们最爱毛主席》，互相激励，奋勇向前。有的人还指着公路旁的里程碑，拍拍同伴的肩膀说：“我们离毛主席又近了二十里！”
    毛泽东思想就是力量！风雨算得了什么，疼痛不在话下！小将们学着老八路的样子，用头发丝把血泡穿破，在脚脖子上贴上膏药，继续昂首挺胸，大踏步前进。沿途一辆辆汽车，一排排大车，从他们身边驶过，驾驶员、驭手们热情地邀请他们上车，他们都一一婉言谢绝。
    九月二十一日，长征红卫队从河北玉田县的采亭桥出发，走到相距一百二十里的三河县。这是他们连续行军的第二十七天，也是行程最长的一天。这一天，对于每一个长征红卫队员，都是一次严峻的考验。
    李增燊左脚的脚脖子已经又红又肿。上午，他拄着拐棍，紧紧跟着队伍，走了四十多里。下午，右脚脚脖子又肿起来，走道更加困难了。为了不让一个同伴掉队，大家叫他走在队伍的最前面。他想：不能因为自己走得慢，推迟整个队伍到达宿营地，咬咬牙也得走出速度来！
    这时候，毛主席的亲切教导在他耳旁萦回：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”
    这时候，同伴们的鼓励在他耳边回响：“坚持！坚持！走一步，就离北京近一步，走一步，就靠近毛主席身边一步！”
    他坚强地自言自语着：“痛吧，痛吧，再痛也抵不过毛主席给我的力量！”他拄着拐棍，挺起胸膛，迈开大步，以每小时十二里的速度，向毛主席身边走来。
    就这样，长征红卫队里这些革命青年，在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，在要见毛主席的崇高愿望的激励下，用大无畏的精神战胜了徒步跋涉的种种困难。他们跨过一道道山岭，趟过一条条河川，以平均每天八九十里的速度，向文化大革命的中心、世界革命的圣地——北京前进。
    这些革命青年在自己的《长征宣言书》中说：“我们的长征是宣言书。”他们以自己的实际行动向全世界宣告：毛泽东时代的红卫兵和革命青年是英雄好汉，他们不怕苦，不怕死，为了革命，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！
    阶级教育的大课堂
    长征红卫队从大连走到北京，经过了辽宁、河北的四个市、十七个县，行程两千余里。这两千余里行程，是培养艰苦奋斗作风的大熔炉，也是提高政治觉悟的大课堂。
    一路上，他们对这个没有教学楼、没有实验室的大学校怀着深厚的感情，如饥似渴地学习着教室里学不到的东西。
    在长征红卫队里，有两位打前站的同志。他们是负责安排沿途食宿的，但是，他们更重要的任务是了解受教育的材料，物色学习的对象，安排参加生产劳动。
    有时候，经过一天行军，已很劳累，但是当大家得知打前站的同志已经安排好要和老贫农座谈，都兴高采烈、精神抖擞地奔赴会场。他们说：饭可以不吃，觉可以少睡，向贫下中农学习的机会决不能漏掉。
    在兴城县曹庄公社，长征红卫队战士们打听到这里有一个名叫周华的十三岁的学习毛主席著作积极分子。他们就抓紧第二天出发前的时间，一大早把周华请来谈学习体会。这位小将从一九六四年以来一直坚持学习毛主席著作，思想觉悟不断提高，两年多来为集体、为五保户做了许多好事。长征红卫队的战士们一面听一面记，不少人当场表示：我们年龄比他大，可是活学活用毛主席著作不如他。今后一定要向这位小将看齐，老老实实地学，扎扎实实地用，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
    一路上，他们看到村村户户挂着毛主席像，贴着毛主席语录。有多少次，当他们列队行进的时候，正在地里干活的社员，打听到他们是上北京见毛主席的，就围拢上来。这些社员们的第一句话都是：“见了毛主席，一定要代我们问好，祝他老人家万寿无疆！”有的人送了一程又一程，临别时，放声歌唱《东方红》，不断高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    卢龙县人民印刷厂的工人，知道他们要印宣传材料，不吃饭，不睡觉，连夜为他们排版、印刷，直到天明。工人们说：我们能为宣传毛泽东思想出把力，感到非常光荣、非常自豪。
    工农群众对毛主席的无比热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限崇拜，使长征红卫队的战士们受到很大教育。他们说：工人、贫下中农对毛主席的阶级感情就是比我们深。我们向工农群众学习，首先就要学习他们这种阶级感情。
    长征红卫队一路上也亲眼看到了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，看到广大社员在改天换地的斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，产生了巨大的物质力量。
    金县二十里堡，原来是个严重缺水的山区。有的资产阶级“专家”曾经断言这里打不出水。但是，贫下中农反复学习了《愚公移山》，下定决心：就是把地球打穿，也要打出水来！现在，一口口二三十丈深的大水井源源不断地灌溉着农田，粮食亩产量比过去增加两倍多。长征红卫队的战士们从大量这样的生动感人的事例中深切地体会到：劳动人民一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能创造出任何人间奇迹！
    长征红卫队还顺路访问了一些革命遗迹。一天中午，他们来到塔山革命烈士纪念塔前，请管理人员介绍了解放战争时期这一著名的阻击战的可歌可泣的英雄事迹。他们面对纪念塔，向烈士们庄重宣誓：“我们‘长征红卫队’要踏着你们的血迹，接过你们手中的枪，继续战斗，去完成你们未竟的事业。为了使伟大祖国千秋万代不变颜色，为了建设和保卫无产阶级的铁打江山，我们随时准备经受千辛万苦，不惜牺牲自己的一切，永远跟着毛主席干革命！”
    这些革命青年在自己的《长征宣言书》中说：“我们的长征是取经队”。的确，他们一路上取到了许多在学校里见不到的“真经”。他们自豪地说：我们虽然离开了明亮的教室、舒适的床位和优越的生活条件，抛开了方便的交通工具，但是在思想上得到了一次大解放，大锻炼，大提高。
    红色宣传队
    长征红卫队的战士们根据毛主席的教导，在《长征宣言书》中给自己规定，他们的长征是宣传队。他们走到哪里，就在哪里宣传毛泽东思想，宣传无产阶级文化大革命，宣传党中央的十六条。
    他们一路张贴毛主席语录，一路散发宣传毛泽东思想的传单。在田头，在村旁，在灯下，在灶前，在半路休息的时候，在跟群众一起劳动的时候，他们都拿出《毛主席语录》，翻开十六条，读给群众听。
    有一天，他们走了八十里路，下午五点到达滦县王店子公社庄窝大队。他们看到许多社员坐在场院里剥玉米，觉得是个做宣传工作的好机会，便匆匆吃完饭，赶去跟社员一起劳动。这时候，天色已晚，他们就打着手电筒朗诵毛主席语录，读十六条，念人民日报社论，边劳动边宣传了三个小时。社员们很受感动，许多人称赞说：你们真是毛泽东思想宣传员！
    长征红卫队还用自己的实际行动作宣传，使沿途群众看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年一代的优良作风。每到一个地方，他们都按照毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意的精神，把院子打扫得干干净净，把水缸挑得满满的。他们尽量挤出时间帮助群众秋收，帮助群众干零活。一路上做了许许多多好事。
    过复州河的时候，既没有桥，也没有船，有一位老大娘正坐在岸边发愁。这时候，长征红卫队的战士们已经走得很累了，但是想起毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，有两个人还是毫不犹豫地走上去，一个背着老大娘，一个在旁边扶着，护送老大娘过河。河很宽，底下全是石头。他们俩脚上都打了不少血泡，水一浸，石尖一扎，痛得钻心。他们默念着毛主席在《为人民服务》中的教导，坚持着把老大娘送过了五十多米宽的水面。
    九月二十二日，长征红卫队到了通县。这时候，他们已经连续行军将近一个月了。他们没有首先考虑休息，而是向县人委生产办公室提出要到公社参加劳动。县里的同志看到他们劲头很大，没有劝住他们，只好在开介绍信的时候，说明他们经过长途跋涉，十分疲劳，希望在劳动中给予照顾。他们到了生产队，却对社员们说：“要照顾，就照顾我们干重活！”他们和社员一起收玉米，拔小豆，一个个活像小老虎。
    这一切，深深感动着沿途的广大群众。不少人称赞他们是“毛主席的忠实的红小兵”，“老红军、老八路的红后代”。
    丰润县七十多岁的郝和生老大爷，看了革命小将们的行动，联想起自己在抗日战争时期做地下交通员时，冒着生命危险散发革命传单的往事，回想起当年八路军的优良作风，老人家拍拍小将们的肩膀，兴奋地说：“你们积极宣传毛泽东思想，认真按毛主席的指示办事，干得对，干得好！我对你们很放心，你们一定能接好革命的班！”
    见到日夜想念的红太阳
    一九六六年十月一日，这个伟大的日子，将永远铭刻在长征红卫队全体战士的心里。这一天，他们终于见到了日夜想念的红太阳——伟大领袖毛主席。
    头天夜晚，是一个不眠之夜。
    长征红卫队的十五名战士，思潮汹涌，翻腾不已。
    世代雇农出身的孙凤岐，想起父亲在旧社会给地主扛长工，挨地主鞭打，逼得妻离子散闯关东的苦难岁月。是敬爱的毛主席，把他一家从火坑里救出来，是毛主席使他进了大学！
    张怀发记起了在解放区的孤儿院里，第一次喊“毛主席万岁”，第一次唱《毛主席是大救星》的情景。有一年过春节，老师给他们穿上新棉衣，并且告诉他们：“这是毛主席给的。”那时候，他没有亲人，他觉得毛主席就是他唯一的亲人。多少年来，他是多么渴望着见一见救命恩人毛主席啊！
    许许多多辛酸、甜蜜的回忆涌上心头，多年的愿望即将实现，怎么能睡得着呢？！有的人睡下去，又爬起来，记一段日记，读一段毛主席语录，老是恨天色亮得太迟。
    幸福的日子终于到了。这一天，队长李隆夫代表长征红卫队上了天安门城楼。他站在毛主席身旁，足足有一个多小时。在这最难忘的一小时里，他觉得一年前身负重伤，十多位同学输到自己身上的热血一直在沸腾，他一次又一次地轻轻地喊道：“毛主席啊，毛主席！祝您老人家万寿无疆！”十二时二十八分，他跟红卫兵战友们列队走过毛主席面前，接受了伟大领袖的检阅。他赶紧在毛主席语录本上，记下了这个最幸福的时刻。
    这一天，他们当中有七位战友上了观礼台。当毛主席走向天安门城楼两侧，向他们亲切招手的时候，一股幸福的暖流，立时传遍每个人全身。他们用最大的力气一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    参加游行的另外七位战友，手里举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，欢呼着从毛主席面前走过。经过连续两千多里行军，腿关节还有些痠痛，脚脖子还有些红肿。但是，他们走在游行队伍中，步伐显得格外矫健。一个月徒步行军的劳累，变成了欢欣的回忆。他们向伟大领袖表示：
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们不怕任何艰难险阻，决心跟着您，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，决心跟着您，在共产主义的万里征途中奋勇前进！
