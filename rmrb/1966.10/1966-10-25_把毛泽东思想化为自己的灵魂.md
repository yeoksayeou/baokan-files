Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the enemies who carry guns are eliminated, the enemies who do not carry guns still exist. They will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us, and we must not underestimate these enemies." As long as we have Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we can stand firm on the proletarian standpoint, unshakable by winds and unbreakable by stones. No matter how desperately a handful of anti-party, anti-socialist elements serve imperialism and revisionism and vie with us for leadership, they will never succeed! We must sweep away these demons and ghosts and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

After reading the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I understood the great truth of living and dying for the people. As long as one has an infinite red heart for serving the people, a limited life can produce infinite power.

		—Zhang Yongqing

To serve the people, one must not shirk from heavy tasks. Revolutionaries must fulfill their duties on whatever post they are assigned. I will always use Mao Zedong Thought to transform my thoughts, constantly struggle against the "self," and resolve to be a petroleum worker for the revolution for life.

To solve problems in one's thoughts for the revolution, one must use the word "thoroughly."

For the revolution, one must be ready to face death without changing expression or heart rate.

To do revolutionary work is a voluntary and conscious action. Though it may be bitter, it is sweet. To do revolutionary work, one must not fear hardship and fatigue.

Revolutionaries must not only be for the revolution but also know how to revolutionize. Revolutionary work must be done every day.

		—Lu Huatai

A person who emphasizes politics in everything helps others and is dedicated to the revolutionary cause. To emphasize politics, one must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, wholeheartedly serve the revolution, and wholeheartedly serve the people. One must use the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs to encourage oneself at all times, making oneself a reliable successor on the petroleum front. To do revolutionary work for life, one must struggle against bourgeois ideology for life.

		—Wu Zhongqi

The question of why one lives and how one should live is a matter of worldview. I am a Communist Party member, willing to strive for the complete realization of communism all my life, willing to wholeheartedly serve the working people, and willing to be a faithful servant of the masses forever.

		—Lei Hongbin

Those who dedicate themselves to the revolution, disregarding their own lives and bodies, putting public interests above personal ones, and becoming nameless heroes, are everywhere in the Mao Zedong era. It depends on whether you are willing to learn from them.

		—Huang Chenghou

Achievements only speak of the past, not the future. One must start from zero. Having achieved active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works in the past is last year's affair. If one keeps thinking about it, one will stagnate. Chairman Mao said: "We must never be content with our achievements. We must always criticize our shortcomings, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day to keep clean and free of dust." A revolutionary must not fear criticism, humiliation, or failure. One must use the weapons of Mao Zedong Thought to constantly struggle against selfish thoughts.

		—Zhang Zhongmin

Mai Xiande was injured in the head on the battlefield but still insisted on fighting. I want to learn from his unyielding spirit and become a staunch soldier of Chairman Mao.

		—Ruan Shurong

Since I started working in 1958, I have always criticized those who damage state property. Some comrades complained that I talked too much and once said to me, "Comrade, your work is good, but you are too talkative." Later, I adopted an attitude of "minding my own business." In 1964, I began to study Chairman Mao's works and realized that this attitude was wrong. Chairman Mao said: "As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will definitely grow stronger." Chairman Mao's teachings reminded me, gave me courage, and clarified the direction I should take. I should insist on the truth in any matter.

### 把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂

专栏：

    把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂
    毛主席教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”只要我们思想上有了毛泽东思想这杆枪，我们就能站稳无产阶级立场，风吹不垮，石打不烂。不管那一小撮反党、反社会主义分子怎样死心塌地为帝国主义、修正主义服务，跟我们争夺领导权，都绝对不能得逞！我们一定要扫掉这些牛鬼蛇神，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    我读了《为人民服务》这一篇文章后，懂得了为谁活、为谁死的伟大真理。
    只要有一颗无限为人民服务的红心，有限的生命就能产生无限的力量。
                                ——张永庆
    为人民服务就不能拈轻怕重，革命者在什么岗位上，都应该尽到自己的责任。我要时刻用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，不断地向“我”字作斗争，决心为革命当一辈子石油工人。
    为革命只有用“彻底”二字来解除思想中的问题。
    为革命要做到视死如归，脸不改色，心不跳。
    干革命是自觉自愿的行动，虽苦亦乐。干革命就要不怕苦和累。
    革命者为革命，还要会革命。革命的事情天天去做。
                              ——罗华太
    一个突出政治的人，事事助人为乐，对革命事业是热爱的。突出政治就要活学活用毛主席著作，全心全意为革命，全心全意为人民服务，随时随地用革命先烈的英雄事迹鼓励自己，使自己成为石油战线上的可靠接班人。干一辈子革命，必须与资产阶级思想斗争一辈子。
                              ——吴仲启
    人为什么活着和应当怎样活着的问题，是世界观的问题。我是一个共产党员，愿为共产主义的彻底实现而终身奋斗到底，愿意全心全意为劳动人民服务，愿意永做人民群众的忠实勤务员。
                                ——雷洪炳
    一心为革命，不顾个人的生命和身体，公而忘私，做无名英雄的人，在毛泽东时代，到处都有，就看你愿不愿向人家学。
                              ——黄成厚
    成绩只说明过去，不能说明未来。必须一切从零开始。以前活学活用毛主席著作有成绩，那是去年的事，要是老想着这个，就会停滞不前。毛主席说：“我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。我们应该抑制自满，时时批评自己的缺点，好像我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。”一个革命者要不怕批评，不怕丢人，不怕失败，要用毛主席思想的武器，不断和私心杂念作斗争。
                                ——张仲珉
    麦贤得在战场上脑子受了伤，还坚持战斗。我就是要学习他的硬骨头精神，做毛主席的坚强战士。
                              ——冉树荣
    我从一九五八年参加工作以来，见损坏国家财产的人就爱批评，有的同志嫌我说话多，曾对我说：“有发，你工作很好，可坏就坏在你的嘴上。”以后，我采取“少管闲事”的态度。一九六四年，我开始学毛主席著作，认识到这种态度不对。毛主席说：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”毛主席的教导，提醒了我，使我鼓足了勇气，明确了方向，应该在任何问题上坚持真理。
                              ——王有发
