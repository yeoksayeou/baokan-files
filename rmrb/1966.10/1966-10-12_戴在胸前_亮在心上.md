Young revolutionaries, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, came from the banks of the Pearl River, from the foothills of Changbai Mountain, to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing. These days, their footsteps have traversed universities and colleges, where they have shared revolutionary fervor and exchanged combat experiences with comrades. As they prepare to leave Beijing with the joy of a bountiful harvest, how eagerly they wish to obtain a gleaming gold Mao Zedong badge! Wearing it, they feel they are always by Chairman Mao's side day and night. Wearing it, they always keep Chairman Mao's teachings in their hearts. Wearing it, they fear neither storms nor waves, and they will always stand at the forefront of the struggle.

To fulfill their wish, they braved the wind and sun, patiently queuing up, waiting, waiting, waiting to obtain a gleaming, red Mao Zedong badge. There are so many touching stories here!

One afternoon, as I walked down the street, I saw six breathless Red Guards rushing towards the badge sales point. They were carrying their luggage and bags, hurriedly asking if this was where the badges were sold. Upon receiving an affirmative answer, they all jumped for joy. But when they learned that the badges would only be sold after 6 PM, their smiles vanished. It turned out that they were students from Tianjin who had come to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. They had to catch a train at 6 PM, but they encountered this situation. They wandered around the store, unwilling to leave.

A few passing students noticed their anxious expressions and approached them, asking, "Comrades, what's troubling you? Tell us, and we'll help you solve it." Upon learning the situation, they each took off their Mao Zedong badges from their chests and carefully placed them in the hands of the Tianjin Red Guards, saying, "You wear them first. We live in Beijing and can buy more." Hands tightly clasped, a warm current flowed through their bodies. A badge contained so much comradeship! A badge bound the hearts of comrades together. The Tianjin Red Guards, moved, said, "Thank you, thank you for your kindness, but we cannot take the badge that you cherish the most."

Those students pinned the badges on their comrades' chests, saying, "Wear them, wear them. Even though you are leaving Beijing, whenever you see the Mao Zedong badge, you will feel that Chairman Mao and we are heart to heart, always guiding our battles."

The Tianjin Red Guards repeatedly stroked the Mao Zedong badges on their chests, unable to speak for a long time. When they came to their senses, those students had already run far away. They shouted, "Comrade, leave your name!" The wind carried back a resounding reply: "We are Beijing's Red Guards."

Looking at the gleaming Mao Zedong badges on those Red Guards' chests, I thought of many, many things...

I saw a little Red Guard from Guizhou standing on her tiptoes in line, hoping, hoping, and finally, when it was her turn, the badges were sold out. She cried in disappointment. The saleswoman, seeing this, took off her beloved badge and gave it to her. Immediately, the little girl, with tears in her eyes, smiled, smiling so sweetly, smiling so happily.

I saw many Red Guards wearing a radiant Mao Zedong badge on their green military caps. They spoke passionately, "Chairman Mao is our red commander. We will wear the Mao Zedong badge on our caps, forever illuminating our path forward."

I saw Red Guards from Chairman Mao's hometown. They received the Mao Zedong badges and hurried to Tiananmen Square. In front of the Golden Water Bridge, they carefully pinned the badges on their chests, softly saying, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we are the little red soldiers from your hometown. The mountains and rivers of our hometown raised us, and your sunlight nurtured our growth. Today, we have crossed mountains and rivers to come to your side, to report to you and to listen to your teachings!"

I also heard of such a thing: A student of the same age as Liu Yingjun wrote to Liu's mother, expressing his determination to learn from Liu Yingjun, and at the same time, he wanted to send two Mao Zedong badges to Liu's mother to express his feelings. But he was disappointed several times when he went to the street. Then, he wrote to the store explaining his situation. Unfortunately, the store's badges were all sold out. For this matter, the salesperson specially rode a bicycle to the factory. The worker, upon hearing that it was for Liu's mother, carefully selected two gleaming Mao Zedong badges. Two badges flew over mountains and rivers, reaching Liu's mother's hands.

Every Mao Zedong badge sales point is an ocean of joy, a boiling ocean. Young revolutionaries, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, come here, receiving one gleaming badge after another, adding boundless strength and courage. These red badges are like red torches, illuminating people's hearts. Many young revolutionaries, wearing the Mao Zedong badges, charge forward in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    戴在胸前　亮在心上
    黎辉
    革命小将满怀着对毛主席的无比热爱，从珠江之滨，从长白山下，来到了无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京。这些天来，他们的足迹踏遍了大中院校，和战友们畅叙革命的豪情，交流斗争的经验。当他们带着丰收的喜悦离开北京城的时候，他们是多么渴望得到一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章啊！戴上了它，日日夜夜都感到在毛主席的身边。戴上了它，时时刻刻都把毛主席的教导牢记心间。戴上了它，不怕狂风暴雨，不怕惊涛骇浪，永远站在斗争的最前线。
    为了实现自己的愿望，他们不怕风吹日晒，耐心地排队等候，等啊！等啊！等待着能得到一枚枚光闪闪、红彤彤的毛主席像纪念章，这里又有多少动人的事情啊！
    一天午后，我正走在街上，看见六个气喘吁吁的红卫兵，朝着纪念章销售点奔来，他们背着行装，拎着提包，急匆匆地问是不是这儿卖纪念章，当得到肯定的回答后，都高兴得跳了起来。但当他们知道要晚上六点多才卖时，笑容顿时消失了。原来，他们是从天津来进行革命串连的学生，六点钟就要乘火车离开北京了，却碰上了这样的情况，他们在商店门外转来转去，不肯离去。
    几个过路的学生看到他们焦急的神情，就走上前来亲切地询问：“同志们，你们有什么为难的事吗？告诉我们吧！我们帮你们解决。”当他们知道了情况后，就都从自己的胸前摘下了毛主席像纪念章，珍重地放在他们的手中，并说：“你们先戴上吧，我们住在北京，会买到的。”一双双手紧紧地握在一起，一股股暖流流遍了全身。一枚纪念章，包含着多少战友的深情啊！一枚纪念章啊，把战友的心紧紧地联在一起。来自天津的红卫兵激动地说：“谢谢你们，谢谢你们的盛情，不过，我们决不能把你们最心爱的毛主席像纪念章带走。”
    这几个学生把纪念章戴在战友的胸前，深情地说：“戴上吧，戴上吧，你们离开了北京，可是一看到毛主席像纪念章，就会感到毛主席和我们心连心，永远在指挥我们战斗。”
    来自天津的红卫兵一遍一遍地抚摸着胸前的毛主席像纪念章，半晌说不出一句话来。当他们醒悟过来时，那几个学生已经跑远了，他们大声追问：“同志，留下你们的名字吧！”随风送来了响亮的回答：“我们是北京的红卫兵。”
    我望着那几个红卫兵胸前金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章，想起了很多很多的事。……
    我看到过来自贵州的小红卫兵，也踮起脚尖排在队列里，盼哪，盼哪，好不容易轮到了她，毛主席像纪念章却卖完了。她伤心得掉下了眼泪，售货员同志看到这种情景，就把自己心爱的纪念章给她戴上，立刻，这个小女孩含着眼泪就笑起来了，笑得那样香甜，笑得那样的幸福。
    我看到过许多红卫兵，在他们草绿色军帽上端端正正地戴着一枚光芒四射的毛主席像纪念章。他们激情洋溢地说：“毛主席是我们的红司令。我们要把毛主席像纪念章佩在军帽上，永远照亮我们前进的道路。”
    我看到过来自毛主席故乡的红卫兵，他们接过了毛主席像纪念章，就赶往天安门广场。在金水桥前，他们小心地把纪念章戴在胸前，轻轻地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席，我们是您家乡的红小兵，家乡的山水把我们养大，您的阳光哺育着我们成长。今天，我们越过了高山峻岭，来到了您的身旁，来向您汇报我们的情况，来听取您的教导！”
    我也听到过这样的事情：一位和刘英俊同年的学生，他给刘妈妈写信表示自己向刘英俊学习的决心，同时想给刘妈妈送两枚毛主席像纪念章表达自己的心意。可是几次上街都失望而归。这时，他就给商店写信说明他的情况。不巧，商店的纪念章已全部售完。为了这事，营业员同志专门骑车去工厂，工人同志听说是送给刘妈妈的，就精心挑选了两枚金光闪闪的毛主席像纪念章。两枚纪念章，飞越千山万水，飞向刘妈妈的手中。
    每个毛主席像纪念章销售点，就是一个欢乐的海洋，一个沸腾的海洋。革命小将满怀着对毛主席的无限热爱来到这里，接过了一枚枚闪闪发光的毛主席像纪念章，增添了无穷的力量和勇气。这一枚枚红色的纪念章，就像一支支红色的火炬，照亮了人们的心。很多革命小将，就是戴着毛主席像纪念章，在文化大革命中冲锋陷阵。（附图片）
