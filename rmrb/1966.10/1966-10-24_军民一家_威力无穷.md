The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," performed by the Shanghai Revolutionary Beijing Opera Troupe, is an excellent play that embodies Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war. This play vividly illustrates that the People's Liberation Army is a people's army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and it reflects the deep bond between the people and the soldiers, where the people love and support the soldiers.

The village of Jiaojiepai was ravaged by bandits, and the villagers were suffering greatly. Chairman Mao said: "To win the support of the masses, to get them to exert their full strength on the battlefield, we must be with the masses, mobilize their enthusiasm, care about their troubles, and genuinely work for their interests, solving their production and living problems." The small detachment of the PLA, pursuing the bandits, came to Jiaojiepai. They shared the people's worries and troubles, treated the people's difficulties as their own, and won the trust of the masses through their actions. The railway worker Li Yongqi was deeply moved by the soldiers' actions: "From ancient times, soldiers and bandits have been one and the same, but I have never seen such a good army!" The people of Jiaojiepai unanimously said: "We have been waiting for you!" Seeing the difficulties in the people's lives, Xiaojianbo, following Chairman Mao's teachings, first organized the people to resume production, cut wood, and exchanged it for grain and clothing. The people's revolutionary enthusiasm was further heightened, and the entire Jiaojiepai became a united force where the military loves the people, the people support the military, and the military and the people fight together.

The play also depicts a very vivid scene: Our reconnaissance platoon leader Yang Zhenrong led the reconnaissance team to visit the hunter father and daughter hiding in the deep mountains. When the father and daughter believed they were the People's Liberation Army, they immediately poured out their deep hatred for the enemy to their comrades and volunteered to guide the reconnaissance team, finally tracking and capturing the murderer, Yituoma. The hunter father and daughter later participated in the battle to annihilate the bandits.

Chairman Mao taught us: "To serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." Chairman Mao also said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" well reflects the excellent qualities of the people's army serving the people wholeheartedly and successfully embodies Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war.

Today, the People's Liberation Army has inherited and carried forward the glorious traditions of our army, doing everything according to Chairman Mao's instructions and always being the people's "old yellow cow." For the sake of the Party and the people, even sacrificing their own lives, they remain "unruffled and unperturbed." Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun are outstanding representatives of this spirit.

The successful performance of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, a blow to the bourgeois literary and artistic "authorities." They oppose us in propagating Mao Zedong Thought and oppose the portrayal of revolutionary heroes on stage. In 1964, when "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" participated in the Beijing Modern Opera Observation Performance Conference, counter-revolutionary revisionists labeled it with many crimes, trying to destroy it. However, their plots did not succeed. We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not agree. We welcome such good plays. We believe that only plays that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, and express the feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers are good plays! We welcome and look forward to more good plays like "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," so that the great Mao Zedong Thought and the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers will forever shine brightly on our literary and artistic stage.

    军民一家  威力无穷

    上海革命京剧文工团演出的革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，是一出体现毛主席人民战争思想的好戏。这出戏生动地表明了中国人民解放军是全心全意为人民服务的人民子弟兵，体现了人民群众热爱子弟兵、支持子弟兵的鱼水关系。
    夹皮沟遭到了土匪的洗劫，村里的群众处在水深火热之中。毛主席说：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益，解决群众的生产和生活的问题”。追剿土匪的解放军小分队来到夹皮沟，急人民之所急，忧人民之所忧，把人民的困难看成自己的困难，并以实际行动取得了群众的信任。铁路工人李勇奇被战士们的行动深深感动了：“自古兵匪是一家，我可从来没有见过这么好的军队！”夹皮沟人民异口同声地说：“可把你们盼来了！”少剑波看见群众生活困难，就遵照毛主席的教导，首先组织群众恢复生产，砍伐木材，换来了粮食和衣服。群众的革命积极性更高了，整个夹皮沟形成了军爱民，民拥军，军民团结战斗的一个整体。
    剧中还描写了一个非常生动的场面：我侦察排长杨子荣带领着侦察员访问了躲藏在深山的常猎户父女。当父女俩深信他们就是人民解放军时，立刻向亲人倾吐了自己对敌人的深仇大恨，并自告奋勇地为侦察员带路，终于追踪捕获了凶手一撮毛。常猎户父女后来还参加了消灭土匪的战斗。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”毛主席还说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”京剧《智取威虎山》很好地反映了人民子弟兵全心全意为人民服务的优秀品质，成功地体现了毛主席的人民战争思想。
    今天，人民解放军继承和发扬了我军的光荣传统，事事照毛主席的指示去办，处处做人民的“老黄牛”。为了党和人民群众的利益，就是牺牲自己的生命，也“脸不变色心不跳”。雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、刘英俊就是其中的优秀代表。
    革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》演出的成功，是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是对资产阶级文艺“权威”们的当头一棒。他们反对我们宣传毛泽东思想，反对舞台上表现革命英雄人物。一九六四年，《智取威虎山》在北京参加京剧现代戏观摩演出大会时，反革命修正主义分子就给它加了很多罪名，非要把它置于死地不可。但是，他们的阴谋没有得逞。我们广大工农兵不答应，我们就是欢迎这样的好戏。我们认为，只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，歌颂毛泽东思想的戏，写出工农兵感情的戏才是好戏！我们欢迎和盼望像《智取威虎山》这样的好戏更多地出现，让伟大的毛泽东思想和工农兵英雄人物永远在我们的文艺舞台上大放光彩。
