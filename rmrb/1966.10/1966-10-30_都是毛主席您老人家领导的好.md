The people of Daqing, both men and women, were overjoyed upon hearing the good news. They unanimously expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, turning Daqing into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on the 29th, the news of China's successful launch of a nuclear missile spread to Daqing Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province. The men and women of Daqing were overjoyed and enthusiastically celebrated another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The people of Daqing unanimously expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, turning Daqing into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Brigade leader Jia Chengran was extremely excited upon hearing the news. He said, "This is a great joy for all the people of China and a great joy for revolutionary people all over the world. It is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against American aggression and for national salvation. It is a significant contribution to the defense of world peace. We, the people of Daqing, resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve the revolutionization of the community members' thoughts, and turn Daqing into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Jia Jincai, the chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association and an old hero of Daqing Brigade, was particularly excited upon hearing the broadcast. He said, "I can shout a thousand times, ten thousand times, but it is still not enough to express the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. I can say a thousand times good, ten thousand times good, but it is still not enough to praise Chairman Mao's leadership. Chairman Mao is forever the reddest red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of revolutionary people. Revolutionary people who read Chairman Mao's books can create all kinds of miracles."

Song Liying, the chairman of the Women's Federation and a female hero, said with immense joy, "People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have spirit, strength, wisdom, and ideals. They dare to think, dare to do, dare to innovate, and dare to surpass."

Guo Fenglian, the female militia instructor and brigade branch secretary, said, "The successful launch of China's nuclear missile has made revolutionary people all over the world overjoyed and imperialists tremble with fear. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet modern revisionist clique are in cahoots, singing in unison, attempting to use nuclear monopoly, nuclear terror, and nuclear blackmail to dominate the world. Their plots will never succeed. She said, "We, the youth and militia of Daqing, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. If the U.S. imperialists dare to impose war on us, we will definitely, together with all the people of the country, break their spines and completely, thoroughly, cleanly, and absolutely annihilate them."

    都是毛主席您老人家领导的好
    大寨男女社员听到喜讯，欢欣鼓舞，一致表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    据新华社太原二十九日电　我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的喜讯传到山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，男女社员无不欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。大寨人一致表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    大队长贾承让听到喜讯后无比激动地说：这是全国人民的大喜事，也是全世界革命人民的大喜事。它对正在进行英勇抗美救国斗争的越南人民是一个巨大的鼓舞，对保卫世界和平是一个新的重大贡献。我们大寨人坚决响应林彪同志的号召，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，实现社员的思想革命化，把大寨办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    大寨大队贫协主任、老英雄贾进才听到了广播，心情特别兴奋，他说：我一千遍地欢呼，一万遍地欢呼，也欢呼不尽毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我说一千声好，一万声好，也说不完毛主席他老人家领导的好。毛主席永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是革命人民的命根子。革命人民读了毛主席的书，什么稀奇的事情都能创造出来。
    大队妇代会主任、女英雄宋立英怀着万分喜悦的心情说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，有志气，有力量，有智慧，有理想。敢想，敢干，敢创，敢超。
    女民兵指导员、大队团支部书记郭凤莲说，我国导弹核武器的发射成功，全世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞，帝国主义胆战心惊。美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团狼狈为奸，一唱一和，妄想用核垄断、核恐怖、核讹诈主宰世界，它们的阴谋诡计永远不能得逞。她说，我们大寨青年和民兵永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，永远跟着毛主席干革命。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们一定和全国人民一道，打断侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。
