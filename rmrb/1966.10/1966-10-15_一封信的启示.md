In early 1965, a batch of veteran soldiers from the maintenance squad of a certain air force unit were demobilized and voluntarily went to work in the Inner Mongolia region of Yikezhao League. Most of the comrades performed well, but there were a few who initially wanted to back out. Wang Zhiguo, the former squad clerk, was one of them. He wrote a letter to Wang Zhongtian and others in the maintenance squad, saying that the place was both bitter and tiring, and he wanted to return to his hometown.

The squad leader, Yuan Shiming, went to the dormitory for a "visit" and discovered this letter, which immediately caught his attention. He then convened a meeting of the party branch committee for serious discussion. Everyone said: Wang Zhiguo's letter exposed that our squad's ideological work was not solid enough, and we should seize this opportunity to conduct living ideological education. Some committee members said: Wang Zhiguo has already left, why bother with so much effort, just talk about it generally. They studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions and believed that the latter opinion was an irresponsible attitude towards the revolution and comrades. After discussion, everyone further realized: Fear of hardship and seeking comfort, unwilling to revolutionize in difficult and challenging positions, is a reflection of the lack of the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. Wang Zhiguo's letter is a living thought that has come to us. His thoughts have a certain representativeness among the maintenance personnel, not only should we not avoid it, but we should also use it as a mirror for everyone to see the dust on their minds.

A big discussion began. The party branch read Wang Zhiguo's letter to all personnel and called on everyone to bring the question of for whom to serve in the army and for whom to serve, to study Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and relevant quotations on class struggle and hard struggle, to link their own thoughts, and to discuss how to view Wang Zhiguo's letter. Based on individual study and small group discussions, the party branch also convened a soldiers' meeting to discuss: Are revolutionary youths led by politics or by money? Why do we revolutionize? Is it for the thorough liberation of the people or for personal comfort? And what is hardship, what is true happiness, and so on.

With these questions in mind, everyone felt that Chairman Mao's words were particularly intimate and warm, touching their hearts. Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members, regardless of time and place, should never put personal interests first," and should "wholeheartedly serve the people," "What is work? Work is struggle.... The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." These words are truly the truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. Comparing with Chairman Mao's words, some comrades who also had thoughts of fearing hardship made self-examinations. Wang Zhongtian is from the same hometown as Wang Zhiguo. Before the study, he had sympathized with Wang Zhiguo, thinking that revolutionizing in any place is the same, why must it be in Inner Mongolia? After the education, he had a great change of mind, saying: "Going to a hard environment to make a revolution, whether one is willing to go or dare to go, is not a general problem, but a major principle problem of whether one truly serves the people or not, whether one is truly revolutionary or not."

Is the problem solved like this? The leaders of the squad said: No. They felt that they should learn from the former Red Ninth Company leader, Chen Jinyuan: Think for the soldiers for a lifetime, be responsible for the soldiers for a lifetime. Wang Zhiguo is a soldier in the squad, and in the place, he is still a soldier of socialist construction. The squad party branch required all comrades to help him politically and use Chairman Mao's words to educate him. Soon, dozens of letters were sent to Yikezhao League. The comrades sent Chairman Mao's teachings, warm encouragement, and strong exhortation, and the deep feelings of class brothers deeply inspired and educated comrade Wang Zhiguo. The local party organization also educated him, so he changed. In his reply, he gratefully said: "The comrades sent not just a general letter, but Mao Zedong Thought, spiritual food.... I was so moved that I shed tears of shame." He expressed his determination to build the frontier of the motherland well.

Now, he and the other three demobilized comrades from the maintenance squad endure hardships and overcome numerous difficulties, working together with the herdsmen to achieve remarkable results.

    一封信的启示
    一九六五年初，空军某部机务一中队有一批老战士复员了。他们自愿到内蒙古伊克昭盟地区工作。多数同志表现很好，也有个别同志一度想打退堂鼓，原中队文书樊治国就是其中的一个。他给机务一中队的王忠田等同志来信，说那里又苦又累，想返回自己的家乡。
    一中队指导员宛世明到宿舍去“串门”，发现了这封信，立即引起了他的重视。于是，他召开了支委会，进行认真的讨论。大家说：樊治国的来信暴露了我们中队思想工作还不过硬，应当抓住这件事，进行活的思想教育。也有的委员说：樊治国已经走了，何必费那么大的劲，只一般讲讲算了。他们学习了毛主席的有关教导，认为后一种意见是对革命、对同志不负责任的态度。经过讨论，大家进一步认识到：怕艰苦，图安逸，不愿在艰苦困难的工作岗位上革命，这是缺乏全心全意为人民服务的思想的反映。樊治国的来信，是送上门的活思想。他的思想在机务人员中有一定的代表性，不仅不能回避，而且要把它作为镜子，让大家照照思想上的灰尘。
    一场大讨论开始了。党支部向全体人员读了樊治国的来信，号召大家带着为谁当兵、为谁服务的问题，学习毛主席的《为人民服务》和有关阶级斗争、艰苦奋斗的语录，联系自己的思想，谈谈应当怎样看待樊治国的来信。在个人学，小组议的基础上，党支部又召开了军人大会，集中讨论了：革命青年是政治挂帅还是金钱挂帅？干革命为了什么？是为人民的彻底解放，还是为了个人安逸？以及什么是苦，什么是真正的幸福等问题。
    带着这些问题学习毛主席著作，大家感到毛主席的话十分亲切，十分温暖，句句说到自己心里。毛主席说：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位”，要“全心全意地为人民服务”，“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。……越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”真是句句是真理，一句顶一万句。对照毛主席的话，一些也有怕艰苦思想的同志，自觉地作了检查。王忠田与樊治国是同乡，学习以前，曾经同情过樊治国，认为干革命在哪里不一样，为什么非上内蒙古不行？经过教育，他有很大转变，说：“到艰苦的环境中去闹革命，愿不愿去，敢不敢去，不是一般的问题，是真为人民服务还是假为人民服务，是真革命还是假革命的重大原则问题。”
    问题这样就结束了吗？一中队的领导同志说：不能。他们觉得应该向前红九连指导员陈金元学习：为战士革命一辈子着想，为战士负责一辈子。樊治国在连队是一名战士，到地方仍然是一名社会主义建设的战士，中队党支部要求全体同志从政治上帮助他，用毛主席的话去教育他。于是几十封信很快发向伊克昭盟。战友们送来了毛主席的教导，亲切的鼓励和有力的鞭策，阶级兄弟的感情，深深地鼓舞和教育了樊治国同志。当地党组织也向他进行了教育，于是他转变了。他在回信中感激地说：“战友寄来的不是一般的信，而是毛泽东思想，是精神食粮……我激动得流下了惭愧的眼泪。”表示决心要好好建设祖国的边疆。
    现在他和机务队的其他三名复员同志，吃大苦耐大劳，克服了重重困难，和牧民群众一起，做出了显著的成绩。
