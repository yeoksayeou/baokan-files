Sichuan is rushing to produce various soil improvement tools.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on the 17th, Sichuan Province's local machinery and handicraft industries are urgently producing various mechanical tools and equipment to improve soil, supporting large-scale agricultural land construction after autumn.

With the successful completion of rice harvesting, more than two million members of agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province are currently engaged in agricultural land construction centered on soil improvement. Sichuan Province has a large area of soil improvement this year, started early, and the demand for various tools and machinery is much greater than in previous years, with a very urgent time requirement.

To adapt to this new situation, Sichuan Province's local machinery industry and handicraft industry have both listed the production of soil improvement tools and machinery as the top priority for the time being, concentrating superior forces to rush production. By the end of September, the industrial sector had already supplied the countryside with soil improvement tools and machinery, which increased by more than two times compared to the same period last year. These include locally adapted and created tools such as foot-operated drilling machines, single-bar manual rammer machines, wheeled soil scrapers, and cableway trolleys. These improved tools have the advantages of high efficiency, low price, simple structure, and convenient operation, and are widely welcomed by farmers.

    四川赶制各种改良土壤机具
    据新华社成都十七日电　四川省地方机械工业和手工业部门，正在加紧赶制各种改良土壤的机械和工具，支援秋后的大规模农田基本建设。
    随着水稻收割的胜利结束，四川省农村目前已有二百多万社员投入以改良土壤为中心的农田基本建设。四川省今年改良土壤面积大，动手早，对各种工具和机械的需要量比往年大大增加，时间要求也很紧迫。
    为了适应这一新的形势，四川省地方机械工业部门和手工业部门，都把改良土壤的工具、机械的生产，列为当前首要任务，集中优势力量，突击赶制。到九月底止，工业部门已经供应农村使用的改良土壤的工具和机械，比去年同期增长两倍以上。其中包括因地制宜地创制的脚踏打眼机、单杠手搬打夯机、轮式刮土板、索道滑车等半机械化改良工具。这些改良工具具有效率高、价格低、结构简单、操作方便等优点，受到农民的普遍欢迎。
