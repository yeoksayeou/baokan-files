Recently, Israel, under the instigation of imperialism, has been clamoring that Syria should be held responsible for the actions of Palestinian guerrillas against Israel, and is preparing to launch a new invasion of Syria. This evil plot has been strongly condemned and protested by the Syrian people and the people of various Arab countries.

Israel is an imperialist tool of aggression, a dagger stuck in the heart of the Arab world. The United States, Britain, and other imperialist powers have armed Israel with large amounts of dollars, pounds, and weapons to invade Arab countries and suppress the national democratic revolutionary movements in various Arab countries. Israel frequently uses various pretexts to provoke and invade Arab countries. This time, Israel, using its usual shameless tricks, is attempting to invade Syria, once again exposing the wolfish ambitions of American and British imperialism to suppress the national democratic revolutionary movements in various Arab countries.

Based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, to deal with imperialism and all reactionaries, one must be unyielding and fight for every inch of land. If the aggressor takes up arms, the victimized must also take up arms. In the face of beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice. If the enemy dares to launch an invasion, it must be thoroughly annihilated. As Chairman Mao said: "It is like this: he comes to attack, and we annihilate him, then he will feel comfortable. Annihilate a little, feel a little comfortable; annihilate a lot, feel a lot comfortable; annihilate completely, feel completely comfortable."

The Syrian People's Mobilization High Committee recently called on all Syrian people to volunteer to join the people's armed forces to defend their homeland from the aggression of imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries. This is the most effective way to deal with the aggressors. Armed people are the vast ocean in which imperialism and all aggressors will be buried. If they dare to invade, they will certainly meet with annihilation.

The Chinese people firmly stand with the Syrian people and the people of various Arab countries, strongly condemning and protesting Israel's invasion plot. We are confident that the just struggle of the Syrian people and the people of various Arab countries, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve victory.

    叙利亚人民拿起刀来
    本报评论员
    最近，以色列在帝国主义的怂恿之下，叫嚣什么叙利亚应对巴勒斯坦游击队反对以色列的行动负责，并且正准备对叙利亚发动一次新的侵略。这种罪恶阴谋，遭到叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民的强烈谴责和抗议。
    以色列是帝国主义的侵略工具，是它们插在阿拉伯心脏地带的一把尖刀。美英等帝国主义以大量美元、英镑和大批武器武装以色列，是为了侵略阿拉伯国家，镇压阿拉伯各国的民族民主革命运动。以色列经常以各种借口对阿拉伯国家进行挑衅和侵略。这次以色列以惯用的无耻伎俩，企图侵略叙利亚，再一次暴露了美英帝国主义镇压阿拉伯各国民族民主革命运动的狼子野心。
    根据中国革命的经验，对付帝国主义和一切反动派，必须针锋相对，寸土必争。侵略者拿起刀来，被侵略者也要拿起刀来。在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。如果敌人胆敢发动侵略，就把它彻底消灭。正如毛主席所说的：“事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”
    叙利亚人民动员高级委员会，最近号召叙利亚全体人民志愿参加人民武装，保卫家园不受帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派的侵略。这是对付侵略者最有效的办法。武装起来的人民，是使帝国主义和一切侵略者葬身的汪洋大海。如果他们要来进犯，就一定逃不掉灭顶之灾。
    中国人民坚决同叙利亚人民以及阿拉伯各国人民站在一边，强烈谴责和抗议以色列的侵略阴谋。我们深信：叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，在全世界人民的支援下，一定会取得胜利。
