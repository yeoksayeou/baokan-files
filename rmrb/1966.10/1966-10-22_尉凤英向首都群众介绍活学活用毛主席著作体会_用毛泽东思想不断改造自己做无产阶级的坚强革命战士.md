The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly held a report meeting on the 19th, inviting Wei Fengying, a female worker and engineer from the Northeast Machine Manufacturing Factory, to report to over 14,000 revolutionary masses in the capital on her experiences and insights in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This provided all attendees with a vivid and profound education in Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Gu Daqin of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Vice Chairman Kang Keqing of the All-China Women's Federation both spoke at the meeting. They said that Wei Fengying is truly a good worker of Chairman Mao, a model for workers, and a model for revolutionary women. Over the past thirteen years, she has consistently read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving great successes in her ordinary position.

They called on all workers and revolutionary women across the country to firmly respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher in the great proletarian cultural revolution, to study Chairman Mao's works seriously and diligently like Comrade Wei Fengying, to truly push the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, to resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

In her report (a summary of the report is on pages two and three), Wei Fengying used numerous vivid facts to explain how she, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, grew from a poor child picking coal to a firm proletarian revolutionary fighter. Over the past thirteen years, she has, with deep class feelings, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, making significant contributions in the three great revolutionary movements. She has completed over 170 technical innovations; she has attended the Labor Model and Model Worker Conferences in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, and the national conferences dozens of times, and has been elected twice as a representative to the National People's Congress. She has had the honor of meeting with the great leader Chairman Mao thirteen times.

At the report meeting, Gu Daqin and Kang Keqing, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Women's Federation, presented Wei Fengying with a bound volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Chairman Mao's calligraphy "Chinese Women." At this moment, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic applause, and the revolutionary masses sang "The East Is Red."

    尉凤英向首都群众介绍活学活用毛主席著作体会
    用毛泽东思想不断改造自己  做无产阶级的坚强革命战士
    据新华社二十一日讯  中华全国总工会、全国妇女联合会和北京市总工会，十九日联合举行报告会，邀请东北机器制造厂冲压女工、工人工程师尉凤英向首都一万四千多名革命群众报告了她活学活用毛主席著作的经验、体会，使全体到会者受到了一次极为生动、极为深刻的毛泽东思想的教育。
    全总副主任顾大椿、全国妇联副主任康克清先后在会上讲话。他们说，尉凤英不愧是毛主席的好工人，工人的好榜样，革命妇女的好榜样。十三年来，她一贯读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在平凡的岗位上做出了巨大的成就。
    他们号召全国广大职工和全国革命妇女，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，像尉凤英同志那样认真地、刻苦地学习毛主席著作，真正把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    尉凤英在报告（报告摘要见第二、三版）中用大量生动的事实阐述了自己怎样在毛泽东思想哺育下，从一个拣煤核的穷孩子成长为一个坚强的无产阶级革命战士的过程。十三年来，她带着深厚的阶级感情，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，在三大革命运动中作出了重大贡献。她先后搞成了一百七十多项技术革新；曾几十次出席沈阳市、辽宁省和全国劳模会和群英会，两次当选为全国人民代表大会代表。她曾十三次幸福地会见了伟大领袖毛主席。
    在报告会上，顾大椿和康克清代表中华全国总工会和全国妇女联合会，把一部精装的《毛泽东选集》和伟大领袖毛主席的题字“中国妇女”赠给了尉凤英。这时全场响起了热烈掌声，革命群众高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
