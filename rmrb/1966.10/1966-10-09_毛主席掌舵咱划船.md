Chairman Mao steers the boat, we row,
The song echoes across both banks.
We've weathered countless storms and rains,
Navigated through countless rapids,
Spring's light shines brightly ahead,
The red sun illuminates the land.
Layer upon layer of waves break beneath our feet,
Thick mist dissipates into thin air,
We laugh aloud from the bow,
Who dares block our revolutionary path!

Hey—Chairman Mao steers the boat, we row,
The song of victory echoes across both banks,
The sail is the great red flag,
The east wind blows us forward for ten thousand miles!

    毛主席掌舵咱划船
    解放军某部　黄婴　廖代谦毛主席掌舵咱划船，阵阵歌声飞两岸，经过了多少风和雨，穿过了多少急浪滩，迎来春光无限好，红通通的太阳照河山。一层层恶浪脚下碎，一重重迷雾化轻烟，咱在船头放声笑，革命路上谁敢拦！哎——毛主席掌舵咱划船，胜利的歌声飞两岸，船帆就是那大红旗，东风万里直向前！
