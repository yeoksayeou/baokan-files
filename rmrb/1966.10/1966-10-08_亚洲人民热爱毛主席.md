The hearts of tens of millions of Asian laboring people yearn for Beijing, yearn for Chairman Mao Zedong. By the side of Mount Fuji, where the waves of anti-American sentiment surge, in the factories and villages of our friendly neighboring countries, and in places under the brutal rule of the running dogs of American imperialism, people are enthusiastically singing the praises of Chairman Mao Zedong, reading Chairman Mao's books, and studying Mao Zedong Thought. Here are a few moving examples from countless such incidents:

Three Billion People Need Mao Zedong Thought

A Burmese friend has two portraits of Chairman Mao hanging in his home. Once, a friend of his asked, "Can't you give one to someone else?" He replied, "My home has four walls; I need two more portraits to hang one on each wall!" Later, this friend found a portrait of Chairman Mao in the Chinese Embassy's publication "Today's China," and he joyfully cut it out, framed it in an elegant frame, and hung it on the wall.

Many Burmese friends enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought. One friend said, "Lin Biao said that China has 700 million people and needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought. In my opinion, the nearly three billion people in the world, in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, also need a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." Another friend said, "The Soviet modern revisionists do not want to revolutionize themselves and do not want others to revolutionize either, which is a vain hope." He said, "The spread of Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable, and the revolutionary tide of the world's people is also unstoppable. Today, China is the center of world revolution. Beijing is the beacon of world revolution. Mao Zedong is the helmsman of world revolution!"

We Want to Hang Portraits of Chairman Mao

An Indian worker has hung a portrait of Chairman Mao in his home for a full ten years. Once, during a rainstorm, the house leaked, and the portrait of Chairman Mao was soaked. He felt very sad and managed to get a new portrait of Chairman Mao. He was overjoyed and immediately went to the market to get a new frame, hanging it neatly in the center of the room.

He said, "Indian laboring people all support Chairman Mao. 'Chairman Mao is good, and we want to hang his portrait.'"

Many Indian friends also wrote letters to the Chinese people, expressing their love for Chairman Mao. A friend from the northern state of India wrote: "China's achievements 'encourage and inspire us. We want to work like our Chinese comrades under the great leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.'"

Please Take My Song to China

Not long ago, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe visited Afghanistan. An Afghan driver enthusiastically asked the Chinese performers to teach him to sing "The East Is Red" in Chinese. He said, "This song is a tribute to the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. I love it very much. So I must learn this song." He said, "Chairman Mao is also a laborer. He is the greatest person in the world, the most respected person. On the day the acrobatic troupe left Afghanistan, this driver, amidst the crowd seeing them off, sang 'The East Is Red' in Chinese with great emotion. He tightly grasped the hands of the Chinese performers and said, 'Please take my song to China!'

During the visit of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, many Afghan workers often asked the Chinese performers for badges with Chairman Mao's portrait. Once, a person who already had a badge with Chairman Mao's portrait on his chest still asked for another. The performers asked him, "Don't you already have one?" He said, "I have one, but my relatives and friends don't. They all love Mao Zedong."

Sending Praise from Afar

The Japanese people love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought immensely. The suppression of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the deception of the new and old followers of Soviet modern revisionism cannot stop the historical tide of Sino-Japanese friendship.

A young Japanese worker told a Chinese journalist that he was very happy when Beijing Radio broadcasted Chairman Mao's quotations recently. He almost listens every night and records Chairman Mao's quotations on a tape recorder. He said that he himself recorded many heartfelt words about Chairman Mao and the Chinese people on the tape and asked Chinese friends to definitely find a way to bring it to Beijing and hand it over to Beijing Radio. This tape also recorded Beijing Radio's broadcasts of Asian, African, and Latin American people praising the great leader Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the Chinese revolutionary song "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman."

This young worker said that from Beijing, Mao Zedong Thought was sent to the Japanese people, making us understand who the real enemy is and who the real friend is.

Concentrating on Reading Chairman Mao's Books

In Ceylon, something like this happened: A female teacher recently joined a study group for Chairman Mao's works and studied very hard. Once, she was reading Chairman Mao's work "The Class Structure in Chinese Society" on a bus and was so engrossed that she did not notice she had passed several stops.

### 亚洲人民热爱毛主席

    亚洲人民热爱毛主席
    亚洲千千万万劳动人民的心向往着北京，向往着毛泽东主席。在反美怒涛澎湃的富士山边，在我们友好邻邦的工厂和农村中，以及在美帝国主义走狗残酷统治下的地方，人们都在热情洋溢地歌颂毛泽东主席，阅读毛主席的书，学习毛泽东思想。这里，介绍的是无数动人事例中的几件：
    三十亿人需要毛泽东思想
    一位缅甸朋友家里挂着两幅毛主席像。有一次，他的一位朋友对他说：“你不能让一幅给别人吗？”他回答说：“我家里有四面墙壁，再有两幅才能一面墙上挂一幅呢！”后来，他的这位朋友，从中国大使馆出版的《今日中国》上，找到了一幅毛主席像，他便兴高采烈地剪了下来，镶在一个精致的镜框里，挂在墙上。
    许多缅甸朋友热情地赞扬毛泽东思想。有一位朋友说：“林彪说过，中国有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。在我看来，全世界近三十亿人口，在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，也需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这也就是毛泽东思想。”有一位朋友说：“苏联现代修正主义者自己不革命，还想不让别人革命，这是妄想。”他说：“毛泽东思想的传播是阻挡不了的，世界人民的革命潮流也是阻挡不了的。今天，中国是世界革命的中心。北京是世界革命的灯塔。毛泽东是世界革命的舵手！”
    我们要挂毛主席像
    一位印度工人在家里挂了一张毛主席像，已经挂了整整十年了。一次天下雨，屋子漏水，毛主席像被雨水淋湿，他感到非常难过，设法又要到一张新的毛主席像，他高兴极了，立即到市场上去配了一个新镜框，端端正正地挂在屋子正中。
    他说，“印度劳动人民都拥护毛主席。”“毛主席好，我们就要挂他的像”。
    许多印度朋友还写信给中国人民，表达他们对毛主席的热爱。北方邦的一位印度朋友的来信写道：中国的成就“鼓励和启发我们，我们要像中国同志在毛泽东同志的伟大领导下所做的那样去工作。”
    请把我的歌声带到中国去
    不久以前，中国杂技艺术团访问阿富汗，一位阿富汗司机热情地请中国演员用中国话教他唱《东方红》。他说，这首歌是歌颂全世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的，我非常热爱它。所以我一定要学会这首歌。他说，毛主席也是劳动者，他是世界上最伟大的人，是最值得尊敬的人。当杂技团离开阿富汗那天，这位司机在送行的人群中，以激动的心情用中国话欢唱了《东方红》。他紧紧地握着中国演员的手说，“请把我的歌声带到中国去！”
    在中国杂技艺术团访问期间，许多阿富汗工人经常向中国演员们要带有毛主席像的纪念章。有一次，一个胸前已经戴着带有毛主席像的纪念章的人还要索取，演员们便问他：“你不是已经有了吗？”他说，“我有了，但我的亲戚朋友还没有。他们都想要这个纪念章，他们都热爱毛泽东。”
    千里送颂词
    日本人民无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想。美日反动派的压制，苏联现代修正主义的新老追随者的欺骗，都阻挡不住中日友好的历史潮流。
    一位日本青年工人对中国记者说，最近北京广播电台播送毛主席语录，我高兴极了。我几乎每天晚上都收听，并且把毛主席语录用录音机录下来。他说，他自己讲了许多对毛主席和中国人民充满深情厚谊的话，录在录音带上，他要求中国朋友一定设法把它带到北京，交给北京电台。这盘录音带还录有北京电台广播的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的谈话，以及中国革命歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》等节目。
    这位青年工人说，从北京向日本人民送来了毛泽东思想，使我们认识到，谁是真正的敌人，谁是真正的朋友。
    专心读毛主席的书
    在锡兰，发生过这样的事：一位女教师新近参加了毛主席著作学习小组，学习非常努力。有一次，她在公共汽车上读毛主席的著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》，由于读得太专心了，以致坐过了好几站都没有发觉。
