In response to Chairman Mao's great call to treat water for the revolution, 300,000 laborers have launched the second battle to control the Haihe River. During work, shovels and people are everywhere; during rest, everyone is reading Chairman Mao's quotations.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Baoding on the 14th, another major project to control the Haihe River in Hebei Province—the Ziya New River project—officially began on October 5. This is the second battle to control the Haihe River following the successful treatment of the Black Dragon River basin last winter and this spring.

People's communes across Hebei Province have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and enthusiastically participated in the river control battle. Currently, 300,000 river control soldiers from 87 counties (cities) in eight districts including Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Hengshui, Cangzhou, Tianjin, and Tangshan have responded most resolutely and enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call to "definitely control the Haihe River." With great revolutionary spirit, they are working on the vast Ziya New River construction site south of Tianjin, launching the second battle to control the Haihe River.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, and the "Sixteen Points" have greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the masses. The number of people volunteering to participate in river control far exceeds the allocated number of workers, with many touching examples of fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers competing to go to work. Many activists and advanced collectives who participated in the treatment of the Black Dragon River last winter and this spring have come to the Ziya New River construction site again.

The 300,000 laborers are all strong, healthy young men with good thoughts and good labor. They carry Chairman Mao's works and quotations, spreading Mao Zedong Thought wherever they go. From the banks of the Ziya River in Xian County to the coast of the Bohai Sea, over a hundred kilometers of the construction site is filled with red flags. During work, shovels and people are everywhere, and there is a joyful sound of labor; during rest, everyone is studying Chairman Mao's works and reading Chairman Mao's quotations. The 300,000 laborers are determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from Dazhai, learn from Daqing, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and turn the construction site into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    响应毛主席伟大号召  为革命治水
    三十万劳动大军打响根治海河第二仗
    劳动时到处是锨光人影；休息时到处在朗读毛主席语录
    据新华社保定十四日电　河北省又一个根治海河的大工程——子牙新河工程已于十月五日正式开工。这是继去冬今春治理黑龙港流域胜利之后，根治海河的第二个战役。
    河北各地人民公社广大社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踊跃地参加了治河的战斗。现在，来自邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定、衡水、沧州、天津和唐山八个专区八十七县（市）的三十万治河大军，最坚决最热烈地响应毛主席的“一定要根治海河”的伟大号召，满怀为革命出工、为革命治水的豪情，在天津以南广阔的子牙新河工地上，打响了根治海河的第二仗。
    无产阶级文化大革命、党的八届十一中全会的公报和十六条，极大地鼓舞了广大社员的革命精神，报名参加治河的空前踊跃。各地报名出工的社员都几倍、几十倍地超过了分配的出工人数，出现了大量的父送子、妻送夫、兄弟争着出工的动人事例。去冬今春参加治理黑龙港的许多积极分子和先进集体，这次又来到了子牙新河工地。
    三十万劳动大军都是思想好、劳动好、身强力壮的小伙子。他们带着毛主席著作和语录，走到那里，学到那里，宣传到那里，热情地传播毛泽东思想。从子牙河畔献县到渤海边一百多公里的工地上一片红旗招展。劳动时到处是锨光人影，一片劳动欢声；休息时到处都在学习毛主席著作，朗读毛主席语录。三十万劳动大军，决心活学活用毛主席著作，学大寨、学大庆、学解放军，把工地办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
