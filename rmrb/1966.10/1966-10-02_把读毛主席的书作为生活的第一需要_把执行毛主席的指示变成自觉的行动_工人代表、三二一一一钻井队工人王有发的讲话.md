	Workers' representative and worker of the 32111 Drilling Team, Wang Youfa, spoke at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as follows:

	Our most, most beloved Chairman Mao:
	Dear Comrades:

	Today, we are able to see our red sun in our hearts, our great leader Chairman Mao, and to be by Chairman Mao's side to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This is our eternal glory and eternal happiness!

	I, on behalf of all workers across the country, greet Chairman Mao and pay tribute to Chairman Mao!

	Our 32111 Drilling Team, following Chairman Mao's instructions, in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, drilled a high-yield natural gas well at the fastest speed, discovering a large gas field. When the gas well was almost completed, a sudden sky-high fire broke out. In the face of the sea of flames, Mao Zedong Thought gave us boundless courage and strength. Mao Zedong Thought directed our battle. All the workers in our team, fearless of sacrifice, fought bravely in the fire. One batch fell, and another batch rushed forward. In just thirty minutes, we extinguished this raging fire. Fire can burn steel, but it can never burn away our proletarian class's red heart of loyalty to the Party and to Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao is in our hearts. We love Chairman Mao the most, love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We must imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, taking the People's Liberation Army as our example, studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, establishing Mao Zedong Thought firmly, and working hard on putting it into practice. We make studying Chairman Mao's books the first need in life, turning Mao Zedong Thought into our soul, making the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions a voluntary action, and regarding revolutionary interests as our first life.

	We resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and, together with the people of the entire country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to grasp both revolution and production, shoulder the dual burdens of cultural revolution and production construction, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Daqing people, summon up all our strength, strive to be the best, and struggle to realize the Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, building our country into a powerful socialist state economically, quickly, efficiently, and at a low cost!

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要  把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动
    工人代表、三二一一一钻井队工人王有发的讲话
    新华社一日讯  工人代表、32111钻井队工人王有发在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：我们最最敬爱的毛主席：亲爱的同志们：
    今天，我们能见到我们心中的红太阳、我们伟大的领袖毛主席，能在毛主席的身边，欢庆中华人民共和国成立十七周年，这是我们永生的光荣，永生的幸福！
    我代表全国工人向毛主席问好！向毛主席致敬！
    我们32111钻井队，遵照毛主席的指示，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，以最快的速度，打出了一口高产天然气井，找到了一个大气田。在气井快要完成的时候，突然爆发了一场冲天大火。在火海面前，毛泽东思想给了我们无限的勇气和力量，毛泽东思想指挥着我们战斗。我们全队职工，不怕牺牲，血战火海，倒下了一批，又冲上去一批。只用三十分钟的时间，就把这场大火扑灭了。烈火能烧毁钢铁，永远烧不毁我们工人阶级忠于党、忠于毛主席的红心。
    毛主席和我们心连心。我们最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。我们要把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。我们坚决响应林彪同志的号召，以解放军为榜样，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，在用字上狠下功夫。把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命。
    我们坚决支持红卫兵革命小将的革命行动，和全国人民一道，把无产阶级文化革命进行到底。
    我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决响应毛主席一手抓革命、一手抓生产的号召，挑好文化革命和生产建设两副担子，学习大庆人的革命精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为提前实现第三个五年计划，多快好省地把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
