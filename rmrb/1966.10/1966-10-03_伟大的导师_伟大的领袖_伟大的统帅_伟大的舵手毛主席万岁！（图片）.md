		Revolutionary Red Guards love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and love Mao Zedong Thought the most. They are determined to take up the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, pass it on, and let it fly forever, fly high!

		Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts. We think of you every day, and we long for you every day! We have finally waited for this day, fulfilling our wish!
