Sichuan sculptors are advancing along the path of art guided by Chairman Mao. The large-scale clay sculpture group "New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree" has been completed.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on the 9th, a group of sculptors from Sichuan Province have been adhering to the direction of art guided by Chairman Mao. Based on the successful experience of creating the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard," they went deep into the advanced unit of the whole country in the style of Da Zhai—Han Yuan County Big Tree Commune, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they created the large-scale clay sculpture group titled "New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree." Through clay sculpture art, they enthusiastically sang the praises of the heroic figures of the poor and lower-middle peasants who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

From reflecting the class struggle of the democratic revolution period in our country in "Rent Collection Courtyard" to sculpting the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction in "New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree," this is another new achievement of Sichuan sculptors using sculpture art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to serve socialism under the guidance of Mao Zedong's thoughts on art. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Han Yuan County saw the new sculpture and regarded it as an unprecedented joyous event. They said: "Overthrowing the idols and ghosts of the old society and sculpting our own heroes, the Party and Chairman Mao have really made us hold our heads high!"

The Big Tree Commune is located by the Dadu River in the southwestern part of Sichuan. The people of Big Tree have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the revolutionary spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, they have cut through mountains to bring water, diverted rivers to create fields, and increased grain production by more than seven times compared to the initial period of cooperativization, and by 2.8 times compared to before land reform, creating the feat of changing the heavens and the earth. At the end of last year, more than fifty artists from five categories of sculpture and woodcut in Sichuan Province formed the Big Tree Commune Art Work Team, adopting the method of large-scale cooperation, using this place as their living and creation base, and began creating thematic art exhibition works "Socialist New Yu Gong." The clay sculpture "New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree" that has been completed is the sculpture part of this art work.

"The New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree" includes a total of thirty-three sculptures of about the same size as real people, divided into three parts: "Cutting Mountains to Build Dams," "Throwing Stones to Divert Rivers," and "Opening Fields and Changing Soil," which concentrate on showing the revolutionary spirit and heroic deeds of the people of Big Tree in their brave and tenacious struggle against heaven, earth, and water.

The creation process of the clay sculpture "New Qu Yuan of the Big Tree" is a process in which sculptors actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and it is also a process in which they combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants to seriously reform their thoughts and feelings. Whether in-depth life or creation period, Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" have always been the sharpest weapon guiding them to solve all the problems they encounter. These sculptors have been following Chairman Mao's teachings since last December, living and working with the people of Big Tree. They lived in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's works with the commune members, and together threw stones to divert rivers, opened fields and changed soil, witnessing the indomitable revolutionary will of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Throughout the creation process, the sculptors repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," made five drafts, and made five major revisions based on the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. To better listen to the opinions of the masses, the sculptors also adopted the method of "open creation" in the formal creation stage. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically supported the sculptors, some participated in auxiliary labor, and some brought several samples of clay and sand for them to choose from. The enthusiastic support of the masses greatly inspired the creation passion and confidence of the sculptors to overcome difficulties. Some young students and those who had been away from creation practice for a long time said: "The countryside is our good classroom, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are our good teachers. Here, we had a very vivid and profound class on learning Mao Zedong Thought and art."

    四川雕塑工作者沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向前进
    《大树新愚公》大型泥塑群像创作完成
    据新华社成都九日电　四川省一批雕塑工作者坚持贯彻毛主席的文艺方向，在总结创作泥塑《收租院》成功经验的基础上，深入全国大寨式先进单位——汉源县大树公社，同贫下中农结合，塑造出题为《大树新愚公》的大型泥塑群像，通过泥塑艺术热烈歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农英雄人物。
    从反映我国民主革命时期阶级斗争的《收租院》，到塑造社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期工农兵英雄形象的《大树新愚公》，这是四川雕塑工作者在毛主席文艺思想指导下，运用雕塑艺术为工农兵服务，为社会主义服务的又一新成就。汉源县广大贫下中农群众看到新的塑像后，都把这看作是空前大喜事。他们说：打倒旧社会的菩萨鬼怪，塑造我们自己的英雄人物，党和毛主席硬是让我们扬眉吐气了！
    大树公社位于四川西南部大渡河畔。大树人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以愚公移山的革命精神，劈山引水，截流开田，使粮食生产比合作化初期增加七成多，比土地改革前猛增二点八倍，创造了改天换地的业绩。去年年底，四川省雕塑、版画等五个画种的五十多名美术工作者，组成大树公社美术工作队，采取大协作方法，以这里为生活和创作基地，开始创作专题美术展览作品《社会主义新愚公》。目前已经完成的泥塑《大树新愚公》，就是这一美术作品的雕塑部分。
    《大树新愚公》共包括三十三个相当于真人大小的塑像，分为《劈山修堰》《投石截流》和《开田改土》三个部分，集中表现了大树人英勇顽强地斗天、斗地、斗水的革命精神和英雄事迹。
    泥塑《大树新愚公》的创作过程，是雕塑工作者活学活用毛主席著作的过程，也是他们同贫下中农结合，认真改造自己的思想感情的过程。不论在深入生活或创作期间，毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作，一直是指导他们解决面临的一切问题的最锐利武器。这些雕塑工作者从去年十二月开始，就按照毛主席的教导，同大树人生活、劳动在一起。他们住在贫下中农家里，同社员们一起学习毛主席著作，一起投石截流，开田改土，亲眼看到了贫下中农的坚韧不拔的革命意志。在整个创作过程中，雕塑工作者们反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，曾经作出五个草稿，根据贫下中农的意见进行了五次重大的修改。为了更好地听取群众意见，雕塑工作者们在正式创作阶段还实行了“开门创作”的办法。广大贫下中农热情地支持雕塑工作者，有的参加辅助劳动，有的带来几种泥、沙样品供他们选择。广大群众的热情支持，大大激发了雕塑工作者的创作激情和克服困难的信心。一些青年学生和较长期脱离创作实践的人员说：农村是我们的好课堂，贫下中农是我们的好老师。在这里，我们上了一次最生动最深刻的学习毛泽东思想的政治课和艺术课。
