The "Three Articles" (_In Memory of Norman Bethune_, _Serve the People_, and _Qu Yuan and the Spirit of Selflessness_) are the foundation course for our transformation of worldview.

The political instructor of the Fifth Company of a certain artillery regiment of the People's Liberation Army, Jin Fulin, writes:

We began studying the "Three Articles" in 1961. At that time, our understanding of the great significance of studying the "Three Articles" was not deep, and we did not grasp them firmly, so the effect was not significant. Some comrades even reflected that the "Three Articles" were studied too many times.

Do the "Three Articles" need to be studied repeatedly? Later, the Party branch, through an analysis of the attitudes of two old soldiers towards their service, realized that they must be studied repeatedly. These two soldiers, one with a low level of education, but with a deep class sentiment towards Chairman Mao's works, regarded the "Three Articles" as a foundation course, learning to read while recognizing characters, applying what they learned, and continuously transforming their thoughts. They served for six years, each year being outstanding. The other did not value the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, did not pay attention to the transformation of thoughts, had serious individualistic thoughts, and was not content with their service. Why did these two comrades, living in the same company, have such different attitudes towards the revolution? We brought this question to the study of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." From this, we realized that studying Chairman Mao's works and grasping the transformation of worldview is fundamental. The "Three Articles" are a compulsory course for establishing a proletarian worldview and are also the highest standard for establishing a proletarian worldview. They must be studied repeatedly, used repeatedly, studied every day, and used every day. They must be firmly grasped and carried out.

To grasp the study of the "Three Articles," we start with the cadres.

Chairman Mao teaches us that educators must first be educated. Cadres are the leaders of the soldiers' ideological revolution. Only when the cadres' ideology is revolutionized can they better lead the soldiers' ideological revolution. Therefore, the Party branch first grasps the study of the "Three Articles" among the cadres. How to grasp it?

The Party branch often studies the ideological trends of the cadres, grasps the issues with universality and fundamentality, and organizes the cadres to use the method of small rectification to study the "Three Articles." Last year, when the cadres' salaries were adjusted, two different attitudes were found. The Party branch believed that this was a struggle between public and private interests reflected in living conditions. Therefore, they concentrated time to organize the cadres to study the "Three Articles." Everyone compared themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and being extremely responsible for work, extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people, and compared themselves with Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. They fought against their selfish thoughts. Everyone said: The revolutionary forerunners, for the cause of communism, were selfless. Now our task is to carry on their work and carry the proletarian revolutionary cause to the end. If we only calculate material benefits, how can we be like the revolutionary forerunners, risking our lives for the revolution? Everyone's class consciousness was raised, and their attitude towards rank and treatment was corrected.

The "Three Articles" are always new, not only to be studied regularly but also to be studied frequently. We use "completely" and "thoroughly" as a measure to examine ourselves, find gaps, and fight against "me." In this way, each cadre's worldview is continuously transformed, and each time they fight against "me," they add a thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

The Party branch also gave the two measures of "completely" and "thoroughly" to the masses, placing the cadres under the supervision of the masses. The cadres also often use company meetings, organizational life meetings, and individual heart-to-heart talks to solicit the masses' opinions, so that if they have shortcomings, they can be corrected in time, making the soldiers more daring and responsible in supervising the cadres.

Because the leading cadres took the lead in studying the "Three Articles," took the lead in transforming their worldview, and dared to expose their thoughts to the soldiers, they effectively promoted the ideological revolution of the company.

Based on the changes in the soldiers' thoughts, we organize the soldiers to repeatedly study the "Three Articles."

Soldiers will have many ideological problems during their service. For example, newly enlisted soldiers often think about job assignments; after a year, they easily think about promotions, transfers, joining the Party or the League; those who are about to exceed their service term or have exceeded their service term often think about their future. How do we help them correctly handle these problems? The most fundamental thing is to help them establish a proletarian worldview. Therefore, we regard the "Three Articles" as a compulsory course for grasping the soldiers' active thoughts, so that every time they solve a problem, they get rid of a bit of selfishness and add a thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.

New soldier Zhang Tiequan, who had studied traditional Chinese medicine for three years at home, was assigned to the wireless class. He did not study or work hard. We organized the new soldiers to study _Serve the People_, repeatedly explaining Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the interests of the people." We repeatedly told the story of Comrade Zhang Side's "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and organized them to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, and visit the company's historical exhibition. This made Zhang Tiequan begin to realize that if a person does revolutionary work with selfish thoughts, they cannot do any work well; with the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, any work is ideal and can contribute to the revolution. He studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, not only contented himself with being a wireless soldier but also completed his duties well and did many good things for the company.

Last year at the end of the year, some soldiers with more than a year of military service had significant fluctuations. Why did those who were previously balanced in their thoughts fluctuate when they encountered promotions and transfers? The fundamental reason is that the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people is not firmly established. We targeted these active thoughts, repeatedly organized them to study the "Three Articles," and emphasized educating them to understand: What is progress? How to progress? We guided them to struggle against their thoughts of fame and wealth. At the same time, we vigorously publicized the advanced thoughts and deeds of old soldier Zhai Chuanbao, who was content to be a screw in the revolution. Through education, many soldiers said: What is progress? The "me" in one's mind is less, and the "public" is more, this is progress. Progress or not, mainly depends on one's thoughts, not on the surface. Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, digging out selfishness, and fighting against "me," can one continuously progress. With their consciousness raised, the soldiers could correctly treat the issues of joining the Party or the League, promotions, and transfers. A soldier who originally thought that not being promoted to squad leader was a waste of talent said: Having the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people is a great talent; "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people is a great use. A person's progress is not in the height of their position but in whether they have the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. He actively assisted the squad leader in his work and became a reliable assistant to the squad leader.

For the ideological problems of soldiers who are about to exceed or have exceeded their service term, we still organize them to study the "Three Articles." They have been tempered in the company for a long time, and their ideological awareness is generally higher. We must use high standards to demand of them, inspire them to grasp their own active thoughts, and consciously carry out self-revolution. Make them understand that the revolution is a lifelong matter. To ensure that one is always revolutionary, one must have high standards and strict demands in ideological transformation, completely fight against "me," and always strive to be the best.

Because we have always used the "Three Articles" to arm the soldiers' minds, the soldiers who have retired, no matter where they go, all obey the arrangements and perform well. At the beginning of this year, nine retired soldiers were to go to factories, rural areas, and border areas. Before they left the company, we used the "Three Articles" as teaching materials and gave them a class. We educated them: Revolutionary work is all hard work. To pick and choose revolutionary work is not "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. "Completely" and "thoroughly" is not to choose conditions and environments but to wholeheartedly serve the people wherever they are placed. When assigning work, originally only one person was supposed to go to the border, but everyone volunteered to go. They said: We want to use the technology that the Party and the people have given us to the places where the Party and the people need it the most. Where the conditions are the hardest, that is where our position to serve the people is.

To make the study of the "Three Articles" more effective, we continuously improve the learning methods, use various opportunities, adopt various methods, and enhance everyone's enthusiasm for learning.

Our era is an era of heroes. Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Jiao Yulu, Liu Yingjun, one after another, have emerged. Their bodies concentrate the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. The Party branch, through each study of these heroic figures, inspires everyone to use "completely" and "thoroughly" as a measure, use heroic figures as examples, find their own gaps, transform their own thoughts, and examine their own actions. In this way, every time they study a heroic figure, many good people and good deeds appear. After good people and good deeds emerge, we use the "Three Articles" as the highest standard to organize everyone to discuss and exchange ideas, so that everyone is always and everywhere educated by Mao Zedong Thought. We feel that: Through the image of heroes, studying the "Three Articles" is a very good method. Using the high standards of heroic figures to examine oneself can find one's own gaps; finding one's own gaps can strictly demand of oneself; strictly demanding of oneself can make our thoughts become redder and redder, and achieve ideological revolution.

The company often has to conduct field training. Field training is a good opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses and is also a good opportunity for the army to study the "Three Articles." In September last year, our company went to Zhugou for field training in the red revolutionary base, and the cannon position was right at the execution ground where revolutionary martyrs bravely sacrificed themselves. We took this opportunity to invite revolutionary old comrades from Zhugou to introduce the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves and to denounce the heinous crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in creating the "Zhugou Massacre." Then, the Party branch organized all the comrades in the company to review _Serve the People_ and _In Memory of Norman Bethune_ at the place where the revolutionary martyrs sacrificed themselves, and conducted education on "inheriting the will of revolutionary martyrs and carrying the world revolution to the end." At the discussion meeting, the comrades said: How to be "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people? It is to be like the revolutionary martyrs, for the cause of communism, fearing neither hardship nor death, with heads that can be cut off and blood that can be shed, but the ideal of communism cannot be abandoned. Everyone expressed that they would remember Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving all the people of China and all the people of the world, and be good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In the past five years, through repeatedly grasping the study of the "Three Articles," we deeply feel that: Among countless principles, transforming the worldview is the first. We have firmly grasped the study of the "Three Articles," and the result is that the more the comrades study, the broader their minds become, and the more firmly they think of serving the people; the spiritual face of the company has undergone tremendous changes, the proletarian political atmosphere is getting higher and higher, good people and good deeds are getting more and more, and the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people is deeply rooted in the company.

    “老三篇”是我们改造世界观的基础课
    解放军某炮团五连指导员　金富林
    我们抓“老三篇”（《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》）的学习，从一九六一年就开始了。那时，我们对学习“老三篇”的重大意义认识不深，抓得不狠，效果也不大，有些同志甚至反映“老三篇”学的次数太多了。
    “老三篇”需不需要反复学？后来，党支部通过对两个老战士服役态度的分析，认识到非反复学不可。这两个战士，一个文化程度不高，但对毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情，把“老三篇”作为基础课，边认字，边读书，边应用，不断地改造思想，服役六年，年年红。另一个则不重视活学活用毛主席著作，不注意思想改造，个人主义思想严重，不安心服役。为什么两个同志生活在一个连队，对待革命的态度截然不同？我们带着问题，学习了毛主席的教导。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”，从而使我们认识到学习毛主席著作，抓世界观的改造是一个根本。而“老三篇”是树立无产阶级世界观的必修课程，也是树立无产阶级世界观的最高标准，必须反复学、反复用，天天学、天天用，必须坚定不移地狠抓下去。
    抓“老三篇”学习，首先从干部抓起
    毛主席教导我们，教育者必须先受教育。干部是战士思想革命化的带头人，只有干部思想革命化了，才能更好地带动战士思想革命化。因此，党支部抓“老三篇”的学习，首先从干部抓起。怎么抓呢？
    党支部经常研究干部的思想动向，抓住带普遍性、根本性的问题，组织干部用小整风的方法学习“老三篇”。去年干部调整薪金，发现有两种不同的态度。党支部认为这是两种世界观在生活待遇上的反映，是一场公与私的斗争。于是集中时间，组织干部学习“老三篇”。大家对照毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务和对工作极端负责任，对同志对人民极端热忱的教导，对照张思德、白求恩，狠斗了自己的私心杂念。大家说：革命前辈为了共产主义事业，公而忘私，现在我们的任务，就是要接好他们的班，把无产阶级革命事业进行到底，如果光在物质待遇上打算盘，怎么能做到像革命先辈那样，豁出命来干革命？大家的阶级觉悟提高了，对级别待遇的态度也端正了。
    “老三篇”常学常新，不仅要定期学，而且要经常学。我们每个月都要以“完全”“彻底”作尺子，量自己，找差距，狠斗“我”字，狠挖根源。这样，每个干部的世界观不断得到改造，斗一次“我”字，添一分“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。
    党支部还把“完全”“彻底”这两把尺子交给群众，让干部置身于群众监督之下。干部们也经常利用连务会，组织生活会，和个别谈心等活动，征求群众的意见，使自己有了缺点，能及时得到纠正，使战士对干部的监督更加大胆，更加负责。
    由于领导干部带头学“老三篇”，带头改造世界观，敢于在战士面前亮思想，斗私心，有效地促进了连队的思想革命化。
    根据战士的思想变化，组织战士反复学习“老三篇”
    战士在服役期间，会产生许多思想问题。如：刚入伍的新战士常考虑工作分配问题；一年以后容易考虑提升调动、入党入团问题；即将超期或超期服役的又常常考虑前途问题。如何帮助他们正确处理这些问题呢？最根本的是帮助他们树立无产阶级世界观。所以，我们把“老三篇”作为抓战士活思想的必修课，使他们每解决一个问题，就去掉一分私心，增加一分“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。
    新战士张铁圈，在家学过三年中医，分配到无线班以后，他学习、工作不起劲。我们组织新战士学习《为人民服务》，反复讲解毛主席的教导：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”反复讲述张思德同志“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的事迹，并组织他们忆苦思甜，参观连史展览。使张铁圈开始认识到：一个人如果带着私心杂念干革命，什么工作也干不好；有了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，什么工作都是理想的，都能为革命作出贡献。他刻苦学习毛主席著作，不但安心当无线兵，还较好地完成了本职工作，并为连队做了许多好事。
    去年年底调整人员，有些军龄一年以上的战士波动较大。为什么过去思想平衡的人，一遇到提升调动又波动了呢？根本原因是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想树立得还不牢固。我们针对这些活思想，反复组织他们学习“老三篇”，着重教育他们懂得：什么叫进步？怎样才能进步？诱导他们和名利思想作斗争。同时，我们还大力宣扬了老战士翟传宝甘当革命的螺丝钉的先进思想和先进事迹。通过教育，许多战士说：什么叫进步？脑子里“私”字少了，“公”字多了，这就是进步。进步不进步，主要看思想，不是看表面。只有活学活用毛主席著作，挖掉私心，斗倒“我”字，才能使自己不断地进步。认识提高了，战士们对入党入团、提升调动问题，都能正确对待了。有个原来认为没有提拔当班长是大材小用的战士说：有了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，这就是大材；“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务，这就是大用。一个人的进步，不在于职位的高低，而在于是否有全心全意为人民服务的思想。他主动协助班长工作，成了班长的得力助手。
    对待即将超期或超期服役的战士的思想问题，我们仍然是组织他们学习“老三篇”。他们在连队锻炼时间长，思想觉悟一般都比较高，对他们必须用高标准来要求，启发他们自己抓自己的活思想，自觉地进行自我革命。使他们懂得，革命是一辈子的事，要保证自己永远革命，就必须在思想改造上高标准，严要求，把“我”字彻底斗倒，永远艰苦奋斗，永远力争上游。
    由于我们一直是用“老三篇”武装战士的头脑，退役的战士无论到哪里都服从分配，表现很好。今年年初，九名退役的战士要到工厂、农村、边疆去。他们离队之前，我们以“老三篇”为教材，给他们上了课。教育他们：革命工作，都是艰苦的工作，对革命工作挑挑拣拣，就不是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，“完全”“彻底”就是不讲条件，不择环境，放在哪里就在哪里全心全意地为人民服务。在分配工作时，本来只要一个人去边疆，但大家都争着去。他们说：我们要把党和人民给我们的技术，用到党和人民最需要的地方，哪里条件最艰苦，哪里就是我们为人民服务的岗位。
    时时学，处处学，让“老三篇”占领一切阵地
    为了使“老三篇”的学习取得更大成效，我们不断改进学习方法，利用各种机会，采取多种方法，提高大家学习的积极性。
    我们的时代，是英雄辈出的时代。雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄、刘英俊，一个接着一个地涌现。他们的身上，集中地体现了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。党支部通过每次学习这些英雄人物，启发大家以“完全”“彻底”作尺子，以英雄人物为榜样，找出自己的差距，改造自己的思想，检查自己的行动。这样，每学习一次英雄人物，就出现许多好人好事。好人好事涌现出来后，我们又以“老三篇”为最高标准，组织大家座谈讨论，使大家时时、处处都受到毛泽东思想的教育。我们体会到：通过英雄形象，学习“老三篇”，是一个很好的方法。用英雄人物的高标准来检查自己，才能找出自己的差距；找到了自己的差距，才能严格地要求自己；严格地要求自己，才能把我们的思想炼得红上加红，实现思想革命化。
    连队经常要搞野营训练。野营训练既是向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想的好机会，也是部队学习“老三篇”的好机会。去年九月，我们连到红色革命根据地竹沟野营，炮阵地就在当年革命烈士英勇就义的刑场。我们借这个机会，请竹沟的革命老前辈，介绍了革命烈士英勇就义的英雄事迹，控诉了国民党反动派制造“竹沟惨案”的滔天罪行。接着，党支部组织全连同志在革命烈士就义的地方，重温了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》，对全连进行了“继承革命先烈遗志，将世界革命进行到底”的教育。讨论会上，同志们说：怎样才算“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务？就是要像革命先烈那样，为了共产主义事业，一不怕苦、二不怕死，头可断、血可流，共产主义的理想不可丢。大家纷纷表示：要牢记毛主席全心全意为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的教导，当好无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    近五年来，我们通过反复抓“老三篇”的学习，深深体会到：千条万条，改造世界观是第一条。我们狠抓了“老三篇”的学习，结果是使同志们越学心胸越开阔，越学为人民服务的思想越牢固；使连队的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，无产阶级的政治空气越来越高，好人好事越来越多，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，在连队越扎越深。　　　　　（新华社）
