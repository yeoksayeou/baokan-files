Chairman Mao waves to us

Chairman Mao, we Red Guards think of you day and night. We have come to Beijing, and our most urgent wish is to see you. The train rushes forward, but our hearts are even more eager, as if we could sprout wings and fly to your side.

The unforgettable day finally arrived. On the morning of October 18th, Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, who had come to Beijing to link up, formed two long lines stretching fifty li along the wide avenues of the capital. What a stirring scene! Everywhere, people were reading Chairman Mao's quotations, everywhere, revolutionary songs were being sung. The fifty-li avenue was a vast, surging sea of red.

At 1:06 in the afternoon, it was the happiest moment of our lives. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, drove by in front of us. The crowd immediately erupted in thunderous cheers. Everyone held up copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" For the first time, I experienced what it feels like to be at the happiest moment in one's life. Nothing is as sweet as this, nothing is as joyful!

Chairman Mao is so healthy, his face glowing, full of vigor. He smiled and waved to us, what a powerful hand he has!

Chairman Mao's warm wave made my heart instantly bright. I am more convinced than ever that with Chairman Mao as our red commander, guiding us forward, victory will forever be ours.

    毛主席向我们招手
    毛主席，我们红卫兵日夜想念您。我们来到北京，最迫切的愿望就是见到您。火车急驰，我们的心情比火车更急，恨不得插上翅膀，快快飞到您的身边。
    难忘的一天终于到来了。十月十八日清晨，全国各地来京串连的红卫兵和革命师生，在首都长达五十华里的宽阔大道上，排成了两列一眼望不见头的红色巨流。这是多么激动人心的场面啊，到处在朗读毛主席语录，到处在高唱革命歌曲，五十里大道是一片欢腾的红色海洋。
    下午一点零六分，是我们一生中最幸福的时刻。最敬爱的领袖毛主席乘车来到我们面前，人群里立刻爆发出山呼海啸般的欢呼声。大家举着《毛主席语录》本，高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”我第一次体会到人在最幸福的时刻是什么滋味，什么东西也没有这样甜，什么事也没有这么乐！此时此刻，我们是世界上最幸福的人。
    毛主席他老人家是那么健康，满面红光，神采奕奕。他笑着向我们招手，那是多么有力的大手啊！
    毛主席亲切地向我们招手，使我心里顿时亮堂堂。我更加坚信，有毛主席做我们的红司令，有毛主席引导我们前进，胜利是永远属于我们的。
