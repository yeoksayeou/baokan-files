Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in the Hearts of All Ethnic Peoples

More than 600 representatives from 40-plus ethnic minorities in 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions exchanged experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works after Lin Biao's call to advance the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The representatives, using the languages of their respective ethnic groups, unanimously praised: "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in the hearts of all ethnic peoples! Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of unity among all ethnic groups, and the guiding principle for unity of thought and action among all ethnic peoples." They also said: "Although our ethnic groups and industries have countless differences, once armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the 700 million people of the entire nation become an invincible giant!"

The more than 600 ethnic minority representatives came to the capital to participate in the National Day celebrations. After arriving in the capital before National Day, they all cherished deep class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, regarding the study of Chairman Mao's works as their primary need in life. Every morning, as soon as it was light, they would get up to read Chairman Mao's books. Whenever they went out to visit places by car, they would collectively recite Chairman Mao's quotations. Many people often took notes on their studies until late at night. After Lin Biao's call, the representatives were even more excited and enthusiastically responded, holding study sessions and discussions that very day. At the experience-sharing meeting on studying Chairman Mao's works, famous activists in studying Chairman Mao's works, Huang Shuyu (Korean) and Basang (Tibetan), shared their insights and experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. During the group discussions, the more than 600 representatives compared themselves to exemplary models, finding gaps and expressing their determination to return home not only to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works but also to more actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, mobilizing the masses of all ethnic groups to learn from the People's Liberation Army, achieve ideological transformation, and contribute to the defense of the great motherland's borders and the construction of the country's socialism.

Representatives from Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Guangxi, Ningxia, and other regions emphasized during the experience-sharing that to truly master Mao Zedong Thought and advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights, one must have the strongest class feelings, recalling the bitterness of the old society, thinking of the sweetness after liberation, finding the source of happiness, and firmly remembering the party and Chairman Mao's kindness, further raising class consciousness, and more consciously working hard, seriously reading Chairman Mao's books.

Representatives from the Tibetan and Yi ethnic groups in Sichuan and the Tibetan Plateau said, "In the old society, we were treated as talking animals by the slave owners, beaten and killed at will. It was the party and Chairman Mao who saved us from the sea of suffering. Without the party and without Chairman Mao, we would have none of the freedoms we enjoy today. Chairman Mao's books are our lifesavers, the lifeline of the revolutionary people!" Representatives from the Miao, Yao, Dong, and Tujia ethnic groups in Hunan Province excitedly expressed: "We come from Chairman Mao's hometown and must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works well."

During the experience-sharing meeting, the representatives compared themselves to advanced models, finding gaps, and unanimously expressed their determination to study hard and apply what they learned, keeping up with the new situation, and achieving new levels. They emphasized that studying Chairman Mao's works is not just about holding them in hand, reciting them with the mouth, but more importantly, engraving them in the heart and applying them in action. Many representatives mentioned that we have deep bitterness and hatred, and it is under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that we have stood up. We, the people of all ethnic groups, must forever unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever engage in revolution, and forever be revolutionary people.

The representatives also used many vivid examples to illustrate that Chairman Mao's books are effective once applied, especially "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Ethnic minorities love to read these works, and after reading them, they gain boundless spiritual strength.

After three days of experience-sharing, the representatives' study enthusiasm was fully ignited. Everyone is determined to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, engage in revolution for a lifetime, and be red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime.

Representatives from various ethnic groups who came to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations held discussions and exchanged views on Comrade Lin Biao's call.

    据新华社十四日讯　来自全国二十八个省、市、自治区四十多个少数民族的六百多名代表，在林彪同志发出把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的号召以后，连续举行了三天的学习毛主席著作经验交流会。代表们用各民族语言一致称颂：“毛主席是我们各民族人民心中的红太阳！毛泽东思想是我们各民族团结的灵魂，是各民族人民统一思想、统一行动的纲领”。他们还说：“我们各民族和各行各业虽有千差万别，但是用毛泽东思想武装起来，全国七亿人民就是一个不可战胜的巨人！”
    六百多位少数民族代表是到首都参加国庆观礼的。他们在国庆节前来到首都以后，人人怀着无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，把学习毛主席著作当作自己生活的第一需要。他们每天早晨天刚放亮就起来读毛主席的书。每次坐汽车出去参观，他们在车上也集体朗读毛主席语录。许多人经常写学习笔记直到深夜。林彪同志的号召发出以后，代表们更是兴奋异常，热烈响应，当天就进行学习和座谈。在他们举行的学习毛主席著作经验交流会上，著名的学习毛主席著作积极分子黄顺玉（朝鲜族）和巴桑
  （藏族），向大家介绍了她们活学活用毛主席著作的心得和经验。在分组讨论会上，六百多位代表对照典型找差距，人人表示回去以后不仅自己要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，还要更加积极地宣传毛泽东思想，带动各族群众向解放军学习，实现思想革命化，为保卫伟大祖国边疆，为祖国社会主义建设贡献力量。
    新疆、内蒙古、西藏、广西、宁夏等地的代表，在交流经验时都强调指出，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，一定要带着最强烈的阶级感情，忆旧社会的苦，思解放后的甜，找幸福的源头，牢牢记住党和毛主席的恩情，进一步提高阶级觉悟，更加自觉地下苦功，认真读毛主席的书。
    来自四川和西藏高原的藏、彝族代表们说，在旧社会，我们被奴隶主当作会说话的牲畜，想打就打，要杀就杀，是党和毛主席把我们从苦海中救了出来。没有党、没有毛主席，就没有我们翻身奴隶的一切。毛主席的书是我们救命的宝，是革命人民的命根子！湖南省苗、瑶、侗、土家等族代表激动地表示：我们来自毛主席的家乡，更要响应林彪同志的号召，学好毛主席著作。
    在经验交流会上，各族代表们比先进、找差距，纷纷表示一定要苦学狠用，紧紧跟上新形势，学出新的水平。他们强调提出，学习毛主席著作不仅要捧在手上，念在嘴上，更要紧的是刻在心上，用在行动上。不少代表谈到，我们苦大仇深，在毛主席和共产党领导下才翻了身，我们各族人民要永远团结在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，永远干革命，永做革命人。
    代表们在讨论中，还以许多生动事实来说明毛主席的书一用就灵，特别是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，少数民族人民最爱读，读了以后获得无穷的精神力量。
    经过三天的经验交流，代表们的学习劲头鼓得足足的，大家决心学一辈子毛主席著作，干一辈子革命，当一辈子毛泽东思想的红色宣传员。（附图片）
