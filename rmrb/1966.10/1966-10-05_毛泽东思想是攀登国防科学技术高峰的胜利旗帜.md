The National Defense Science and Technology Commission held a conference to exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works among active participants. The representatives unanimously hailed the great feat of using spiritual atomic bombs to detonate material atomic bombs, pointing out that every achievement in national defense science and technology shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. The meeting emphasized the need to always remember to highlight Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the truth that politics is the commander and the soul, and most loyally, resolutely, and thoroughly execute Chairman Mao's instructions. They must strive to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, temper and transform themselves in practical struggles, and achieve greater victories.

	Xinhua News Agency, October 4th: The National Defense Science and Technology Commission of the People's Liberation Army recently held a conference for active participants in studying Chairman Mao's works from its subordinate units. The representatives, through numerous personal experiences, demonstrated that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental principle of building the people's army and the soul of national defense science and technology work. Mao Zedong Thought is the victorious banner for scaling the peaks of science and technology and the golden key to opening the treasure trove of national defense science and technology.

	Over the past few years, China's national defense science and technology personnel, under the leadership of the Party, have braved storms and hardships, fought tenaciously, broken through the heavy blockade of imperialism and modern revisionism, and overcome one technical difficulty after another, scaling the peaks of national defense science and technology. Under arduous conditions, they have persistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, transformed their thinking, and achieved great victories on the spiritual front, thereby ensuring brilliant victories on the material front. The representatives, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, shared their insights and experiences, unanimously hailing the great feat of using spiritual atomic bombs to detonate material atomic bombs. They agreed that China's brilliant achievements in national defense science and technology are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Every achievement in national defense science and technology shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, demonstrating its immense power.

	The representatives attending the meeting vividly demonstrated with irrefutable facts that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth. Wherever it is applied, it is effective. Mao Zedong Thought commands technology and is invincible. The representatives pointed out that the national defense science and technology team, like the combat troops, must emphasize politics and follow the path of political construction of the military. They must cultivate the spirit of bravery and fearlessness. With this spirit, they can overcome all difficulties and obstacles, master solid skills, and achieve the greatest combat effectiveness. The representatives unanimously agreed that in the research of advanced science and technology, the human factor and the political and ideological factor are the primary factors. Politics commands technology, which means using Mao Zedong Thought to command those who master technology, making people's thinking revolutionary. Only in this way can the material factors and the role of technology be fully utilized, and technical work and other work can be done well. The representatives said: "If people listen to Chairman Mao's words, machines will listen to people. Although Chairman Mao's works do not mention operational techniques, they can guide us in the right direction, liberate our minds, bring wisdom, and add boundless strength." Some said: "Once Mao Zedong Thought takes root in our minds, we will have the greatest courage to overcome all difficulties and produce immense material power." The representatives believe that those engaged in scientific and technological work must always remember to highlight Mao Zedong Thought and firmly grasp the truth that politics is the commander and the soul.

	"To make a revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works is impossible; to study Chairman Mao's works without transforming one's worldview is impossible; to transform one's worldview without making great efforts is impossible." This was the unanimous voice of the representatives attending the meeting. Therefore, the meeting emphasized that "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" should be used as guiding principles for transforming one's worldview and achieving ideological revolution. These three works should be studied and applied repeatedly. One should often use the "two rulers" of "completely" and "thoroughly" to measure oneself. Only in this way can one gradually establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people and be willing to be an "old yellow cow" for the people for life. The representatives pointed out: Old cadres studying these three works can overcome the "self" and eliminate arrogance and conceit, maintain their integrity, and preserve their revolutionary spirit. New cadres studying these three works can maintain the spirit of "five unchanging" principles: persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, maintaining the spirit of an ordinary soldier, maintaining a simple and frugal style, maintaining a humble and studious spirit of unity with comrades, and firmly emphasizing politics. Intellectuals studying these three works can have a firm and correct political direction and steadily walk the path of being both red and expert. Soldiers studying these three works can understand for whom they are serving and fighting, and establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people of all China and the world. The representatives said that "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" are always new when studied, are treasures for ideological revolution, and are effective for whoever studies and applies them. Scientific and technological personnel are no exception.

	At the meeting, many representatives expressed their opinions on the tempering and transformation of scientific and technological personnel. The representatives said that Chairman Mao taught us that all revolutionaries should face storms and hardships. Revolutionaries cannot grow in a greenhouse; they must be tempered in storms and waves. We national defense science and technology personnel must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to practical struggles, go to harsh environments, and temper and transform ourselves. The representatives pointed out that most units in the national defense science and technology system have complex and dispersed missions, and the environment is relatively harsh, which is a test for every scientific and technological worker. In fact, our national defense science and technology personnel regard harsh environments as tempering themselves and have successfully withstood all unimaginable difficulties. They, together with the soldiers, live in tents, drink bitter water, and often work in the scorching sun and sandstorms, rolling in mud, and tempering themselves with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In practical struggles, they fear no difficulties and are infinitely enthusiastic about their work. With a sense of responsibility to the people of all China and the world, they calculate every piece of data and draw every line. They said passionately: "After reading Chairman Mao's books, we understand the reason for conducting experiments for the revolution. We must conduct national defense science and technology at the forefront in harsh practices." The representatives unanimously expressed that in the future, no matter how things change, the will to temper and transform oneself in practical struggles must not change. We must be as tenacious as the red willows on the Gobi Desert, bravely and tenaciously overcome all difficulties on the road ahead. We must be like camels in the desert, taking one step at a time for the Party. We must be like fuse wires, willingly taking on the most dangerous tasks, and if necessary, dedicating our lives to the Party.

	This meeting lasted for eight days. During the meeting, Vice Premier Nie Rongzhen received all the representatives, and the responsible comrades of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission spoke at the meeting. The representatives unanimously expressed that they would definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, most loyally, resolutely, and thoroughly execute Chairman Mao's instructions, and most diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They would achieve greater victories on both the spiritual and material fronts. (With pictures)

	A red sun rises in the east, and the cheers of the masses thunder. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and other central leaders, reviewed a hundred and fifty thousand mighty and magnificent marching troops and celebrated the national day with the people.

    毛泽东思想是攀登国防科学技术高峰的胜利旗帜
    代表们齐声欢呼用精神原子弹炸响了物质原子弹的伟大创举，指出每一项国防科学技术成果，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。会议强调要念念不忘突出毛泽东思想，牢牢记住政治是统帅、政治是灵魂的真理，最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地执行毛主席的指示，最努力地活学活用毛主席著作，到斗争实践中去锻炼改造自己，夺取更大的胜利。
    新华社四日讯　中国人民解放军国防科学技术委员会，不久前召开了所属单位学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。代表们以亲身经历的无数事实说明：毛泽东思想是人民军队建设的根本，也是国防科学技术工作的灵魂；毛泽东思想是攀登科学技术高峰的胜利旗帜，是打开国防科学技术宝库的金钥匙。
    几年来，我国国防科学技术人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在党的领导下，经风历险，顽强战斗，打破帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重封锁，攻克了一个又一个技术难关，攀登上了国防科学技术的高峰。他们在艰苦的条件下，长期坚持活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，在精神战线上打了大胜仗，从而保证了物质战线上取得了辉煌的胜利。到会代表满怀革命激情，畅谈心得，交流经验，齐声欢呼用精神原子弹炸响了物质原子弹的伟大创举。一致指出，我国国防科学技术的辉煌成就，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，国防科学技术的每一项成果，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，显示着毛泽东思想的巨大威力。
    出席会议的代表，以无可辩驳的大量事实生动表明，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，用到哪里哪里灵。毛泽东思想统帅技术，无往而不胜。代表们指出：国防科学技术队伍和战斗部队一样，一定要突出政治，走政治建军的道路，培养人的勇敢、不怕死的精神。有了这种精神，就能战胜一切艰难险阻，掌握过硬本领，就是最大的战斗力。代表们一致认为，在尖端科学技术的研究工作中，人的因素，政治思想的因素，同样是一切因素中的首要因素。政治统帅技术，就是用毛泽东思想去统帅掌握技术的人，使人的思想革命化。只有这样，才能把物的因素、技术的作用充分发挥出来，才能搞好技术工作和其他工作。代表们说：“人听毛主席的话，机器就听人的话。毛主席著作里虽然没有讲操作技术，但是它能够给我们指示方向，解放思想，带来智慧，增添无穷无尽的力量。”有的说：“毛泽东思想一旦在我们头脑里扎根，我们就有了战胜一切困难的最大勇气，就会产生巨大的物质力量。”代表们认为，搞科学技术工作的人，特别需要念念不忘突出毛泽东思想，牢牢记住政治是统帅、政治是灵魂的真理。
    “干革命不学毛主席著作不行，学毛主席著作不改造世界观不行，改造世界观不下狠功夫不行。”这是到会代表的一致呼声。因此，会议强调，要把《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》作为改造世界观、实现思想革命化的座右铭。这三篇著作，要反复学，反复用。要经常用“完全”、“彻底”这“两把尺子”来衡量自己。只有这样，才能逐渐树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，才能为人民甘当一辈子“老黄牛”。代表们指出：老干部学习这三篇著作，就能斗倒“私”字，打掉官气、骄气，保持晚节，永葆革命青春。新干部学习这三篇著作，就能做到“五不变”，即坚持活学活用毛主席著作不变，普通一兵的本色不变，艰苦朴素的作风不变，虚心好学、团结同志的精神不变，坚定地突出政治不变。知识分子学习这三篇著作，就能有坚定正确的政治方向，踏踏实实地走又红又专的道路。战士学习这三篇著作，就能懂得为谁当兵，为谁打仗，树立全心全意为全中国和全世界人民服务的世界观。代表们说，《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》常学常新，是思想革命化的宝书，谁学谁进步，谁用谁灵，科学技术人员一个也不例外。
    在会上，许多代表就科学技术人员的锻炼改造发表了意见。代表们说，毛主席教导我们，一切革命者，都应该经风雨，见世面。革命者不可能在温室里成长，要到大风大浪里去锻炼。我们国防科学技术人员一定要遵照毛主席的教导，到斗争实践中去，到艰苦的环境中去，锻炼改造自己。代表们指出：国防科学技术系统所属的多数单位，任务繁杂、分散执勤，环境比较艰苦，是对每个科学技术工作者的考验。事实上我们的国防科学技术人员把艰苦的环境看作对自己的磨炼，胜利地经受了一切难以想像的困难的考验。他们和战士一起，住帐篷，喝苦水，经常在烈日风沙中进行工作，滚一身泥巴，炼出了工农兵的思想感情。在斗争实践中，他们对困难无所畏惧，对工作无限热忱。他们以对全中国和全世界人民负责的精神，计算每一个数据，描绘每一条图线。他们满怀豪情地说：“读了毛主席的书，懂得了为革命搞试验的道理。我们就是要在艰苦实践中搞出国防科学技术的尖端。”代表们一致表示，今后，千变万变，在斗争实践中锻炼改造的意志不能变。我们要像戈壁滩上的红柳那样坚韧不拔，勇敢顽强地战胜前进道路上的一切困难。要像沙漠上的骆驼一样，一步一个脚印地为党工作。要像保险丝一样，乐意承担最危险的工作，必要时为党献出自己的生命。
    这次会议历时八天。会议期间，聂荣臻副总理接见了全体代表，国防科委的负责同志在会上讲了话。代表们在发言中一致表示，一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地执行毛主席的指示，最努力地活学活用毛主席著作，在精神和物质这两条战线上，夺取更大的胜利。（附图片）
    一轮红日东升，万众欢声雷动。我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，检阅一百五十万威武雄壮的游行大军，同人民一起欢度国庆。  《解放军报》记者摄
