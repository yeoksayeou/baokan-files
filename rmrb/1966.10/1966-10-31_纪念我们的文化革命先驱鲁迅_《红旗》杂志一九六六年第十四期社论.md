The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing along the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, entering a new high tide. The broad revolutionary masses are thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. Under this excellent situation, we are filled with fighting spirit to commemorate our cultural revolution pioneer Lu Xun.

Chairman Mao has given the most comprehensive and profound evaluation of Lu Xun. He said: Lu Xun is the "greatest and bravest flag-bearer of the new cultural army," the "commander-in-chief of the Chinese cultural revolution," and the "most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, most enthusiastic, and unprecedented national hero on the cultural front, representing the majority of the nation, charging into the enemy's ranks."

Lu Xun's life was a life of struggle. He always stood at the forefront of the times, persistently fighting to overthrow imperialism and its running dogs, to sweep away the old culture of the exploiting classes, and to spread and develop the new culture of the people.

In the past, China's semi-feudal, semi-colonial old system and old culture were like cages, confining the people and tightly binding their minds. Lu Xun deeply hated all exploitative institutions and cultures. He shouted loudly and fiercely, sweeping away all old forces, old thoughts, old cultures, old customs, and old habits, "cleansing them all away" and "sweeping them all away." Whether it was the "Three Classics and Five Scriptures," golden statues, ancestral pills, secret prescriptions, or secret concoctions, he overturned them all. Lu Xun, with the spirit of "breaking through the net," launched a brave attack on the old world. He dared to declare war on all enemies, thrusting his spear-like pen into the enemy's heart. He feared neither threats nor isolation, nor slander and defamation, nor open and covert attacks, nor losing his head. "Frowning at a thousand accusing fingers," Lu Xun always despised the "slave mentality" of being submissive and obedient to the enemy. Lu Xun completely broke with old traditions and old forces. He was a true revolutionary, with not a trace of mediocrity, and he had no regrets for the death of the old world. Lu Xun's merciless criticism of the old world was so powerful that wherever his pen pointed, everything was laid bare.

Break first, then establish. Only by criticizing the old world can one discover the new world. Lu Xun did just that. He once said that he did not know what the new things were like before. It was in his struggle against the old system and old culture, especially in his struggle against the reactionary bourgeois ideas of humanism, humanitarianism, vulgar evolutionism, and the Trotskyite gang, that he found Marxism and understood the class struggle theory of Marxism. He used this weapon to observe society, strike at the enemy, and continuously "dissect himself," transforming his worldview and consciously forging himself into a "revolutionary." It was in this intense class struggle that Lu Xun transformed from a radical democrat into a great communist warrior. He firmly believed that "only the rising proletariat has a future," and he placed the hope of the Chinese revolution on the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao.

Today, as we commemorate Lu Xun, we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and learn from his fearless fighting spirit and thorough revolutionary spirit.

"Finishing off a fallen enemy" is a prominent manifestation of Lu Xun's thorough revolutionary spirit. Lu Xun firmly opposed talking about "forgiveness" and "tolerance" to the enemy; he condemned the slander of the spirit of "finishing off a fallen enemy" as "extremism" and "harshness." Lu Xun clearly pointed out that "dog nature" cannot be changed, and if it is allowed to "crawl back to the shore" and get a chance to catch its breath, it will one day "bite" many revolutionaries. Those who easily say we are "extremist" should listen: can we talk about "forgiveness" to the class enemies at home and abroad, to the counter-revolutionary revisionists, to the handful of power-holders in the party who are taking the capitalist road? Can we let them one day crawl back and "bite" the revolutionaries? No, we must learn from Lu Xun's thorough revolutionary spirit of "finishing off a fallen enemy," knock them down to the ground, and make them never rise again.

Lu Xun hated those who played the role of a "mediator" or "neutral" in the struggle between two sides, those who claimed to be "impartial" and "neutral." "Compromise" and "mediation" are "confusing right and wrong" and "helping the tiger." In the life-and-death class struggle, advocating compromise is actually siding with the enemy. Whenever the class struggle reaches a critical moment, compromisers always come out shouting or muttering, but history has destined them to play a tragic role. Currently, in the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, there is no middle road to take. Those who advocate taking the middle road will inevitably fall into the quagmire of revisionism.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line is also a struggle with no middle road. In this struggle between the two lines, to compromise and mediate is actually to maintain the bourgeois reactionary line and oppose the proletarian revolutionary line. All revolutionaries must be like Lu Xun, "passionately advocating what is right" and "passionately attacking what is wrong," with clear love and hate, and firmly holding to their principles and stance.

In the revolutionary struggle, no matter how long and winding the road is, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles are encountered, Lu Xun remained steadfast and fought tenaciously. He opposed those who saw revolution as simple, easy, and smooth, and who became "disappointed and despondent" at the slightest difficulty. This is Lu Xun's persistent fighting spirit, which is to work hard, never give up, overcome all difficulties, and never rest until the goal is achieved. The enemy's siege and persecution only made him stronger. Lu Xun's fighting spirit was forged in the enemy's siege and persecution. When the sky was dark with clouds and he was isolated, he did not feel lonely. Because he was breathing with the people, sharing their fate, and standing on the side of Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. At that time, he appeared isolated on the surface, but he represented the truth, represented the interests of the Chinese proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people, and represented the direction of historical progress.

Reactionary attacks forge revolutionary leftists; this is the dialectic of history. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, leftist comrades should understand this truth, fearing neither twists and turns, nor sieges, nor isolation, consciously tempering themselves in class struggle to become strong steel soldiers.

"Bowing my head to be a cow for the children," Lu Xun believed in the people and loved the people. Because of this, Lu Xun was good at discovering the new forces of society and firmly supported the new forces of society. Throughout his life, Lu Xun enthusiastically supported the development of new things in society, waving flags and beating drums to clear the way for "creating a large group of new warriors." He enthusiastically cared for the growth of the younger generation, inspiring them to fight. From the proletariat, from the masses of the people, from the revolutionary youth, he saw the hope and future of China, thereby strengthening his revolutionary faith and fighting spirit. The attitude towards new things in society is a crucial sign of whether one is revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or anti-revolutionary. Proletarian revolutionaries, when new things just emerge from the horizon, will see their boundless vitality and great development prospects, and will enthusiastically cheer and give firm support. Politically mediocre people are blind and cannot see new things, or are afraid to burn their fingers and dare not support them. The representatives of decaying forces ridicule and ruthlessly destroy new things. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, new things and new forces are constantly emerging, and people must quickly express their attitudes and make choices.

What is most worth learning from Lu Xun is his profound respect and love for the great leader Chairman Mao. In his early years, he once "wandered," but when he found Marxism, especially the Chinese Communist Party represented by Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, he made up his mind to obey and be willing to be a "vanguard" and "soldier" of the proletarian revolution. Lu Xun, regardless of the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the slander of the Trotskyite gang, and the deceitful attacks of Zhou Yang and others, always firmly followed Chairman Mao and bravely defended the correct line represented by Chairman Mao.

"Heroes in their twilight years, with unyielding spirit." The older Lu Xun became, the stronger his revolutionary will, and the more vigorous his fighting spirit. What power was inspiring him? It was the Chinese Communist Party represented by Chairman Mao, and our great teacher Chairman Mao. True revolutionaries must be like Lu Xun, firmly following Chairman Mao, all the way, and advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Today, we are much happier than Lu Xun, being able to personally listen to Chairman Mao's teachings. We must dedicate our lives to the revolution, study Chairman Mao's works, learn Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, to the people, and to the cause of communism.

Our cultural revolution pioneer Lu Xun has been gone for thirty years, but his revolutionary spirit still lives in the heart of every revolutionary comrade.

In the turbulent waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we need proletarians armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with foresight and courage, who are revolutionary pioneers. Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit and his experience in struggle are a precious treasure. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from Lu Xun's example, use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, inherit and carry forward Lu Xun's spirit of daring to revolutionize, being good at revolutionizing, daring to struggle, and being good at struggling. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    纪念我们的文化革命先驱鲁迅
    《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十四期社论
    无产阶级文化大革命，正沿着以毛主席为代表的革命路线，进入一个新的高潮。广大革命群众正在彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。在这大好形势下，我们满怀战斗的豪情，来纪念我们的文化革命先驱鲁迅。
    毛主席对鲁迅给予了最全面最深刻的评价。他说：鲁迅是“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手”，是“中国文化革命的主将”，是“在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄”。
    鲁迅的一生，是战斗的一生。他始终站在时代的最前列，为打倒帝国主义及其走狗，为扫除剥削阶级的旧文化、传播和发展人民大众的新文化而坚持不懈地进行斗争。
    过去中国的半封建半殖民地的旧制度和旧文化，像囚笼一样，禁锢着人民群众，死死地束缚着人们的头脑。鲁迅深恶痛绝一切吃人的制度和文化。他“大呼猛进”，举一切旧势力、旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯“悉与荡涤”，“一扫而空”；不论《三坟》《五典》，金人玉佛，祖传丸散，秘制膏丹，全都踏倒。鲁迅以“冲决罗网”的战斗精神，向旧世界展开了英勇的进攻。他敢字当头，敢于向一切敌人宣战，把投枪似的笔，刺向敌人的心脏。他不怕威胁，不怕孤立，不怕造谣中伤，不怕明枪暗箭，不怕丢脑袋。“横眉冷对千夫指”，鲁迅一贯鄙视在敌人面前“低眉顺眼，唯唯诺诺”的“奴才主义”。鲁迅同旧传统、旧势力进行了最彻底的决裂。他是一个真正的革命家，丝毫没有庸人习气，对旧世界的死去，毫不惋惜。鲁迅对旧世界进行了无情的批判，其威力之猛，简直是笔锋指处，所向披靡。
    破字当头，立在其中。只有在批判旧世界中，才能发现新世界。鲁迅正是这样。他说过，先前对于新的东西是什么样子，是不知道的。他在同旧制度旧文化的斗争中，特别是同人性论、人道主义、庸俗进化论等反动的资产阶级思想的斗争中，在同托洛茨基匪帮斗争中，才找到了马克思主义，懂得了马克思主义的阶级斗争学说。他用这个武器观察社会，打击敌人，同时不断地“解剖自己”，改造自己的世界观，自觉地把自己锻炼成为一个“革命人”。正是在这样剧烈的阶级斗争中，鲁迅由一个激进的民主主义者，转变成了伟大的共产主义战士。他坚信“惟新兴的无产者才有将来”，他把中国革命的希望，寄托在毛主席领导的中国共产党身上。
    今天，我们纪念鲁迅，要遵照毛主席的教导，学习他的大无畏的战斗精神和彻底革命精神。
    “打落水狗”，是鲁迅的彻底革命精神的突出表现。鲁迅坚决反对对敌人讲“恕道”，讲“宽容”；痛斥将“打落水狗”精神诬蔑为“偏激”、“疾恶太严”的谬论。鲁迅明确地指出，“狗性”是不能改变的，如果让它“爬到岸上”，得到喘息的机会，就会有一天“咬死”许多革命者。那些动不动就说我们“偏激”的人听着：对国内外的阶级敌人，对反革命修正主义分子，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，难道可以讲“恕道”吗？难道可以让他们有朝一日爬起来“咬死”革命者吗？不，我们要学习鲁迅“打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把他们打翻在地，使他们永世不得翻身。
    鲁迅痛恨在两军对垒中那种貌似“公允”、“平正”的“和事老”，那种所谓“不偏不倚”的“骑墙”派。“调和”、“折中”，就是“混淆黑白”，“为虎作伥”。在你死我活的阶级斗争中，搞折中主义，实际上就是站到敌人一边。每当阶级斗争的紧要关头，折中主义者总是出来大喊大叫，或者嘟嘟囔囔，然而历史注定了他们扮演的是一个可悲的角色。当前，在马克思列宁主义同以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，是没有中间道路可走的。那些标榜走中间道路的人，必然滑到修正主义的泥坑。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争，也是没有中间道路可走的。在这两条路线的斗争中，进行调和、折中，这实际上就是维护资产阶级反动路线，反对无产阶级革命路线。一切革命者要像鲁迅那样，“热烈地主张着所是”，“热烈地攻击着所非”，爱憎分明，坚持原则立场。
    在革命斗争中，不论道路多么漫长曲折，不论遇到多少艰难险阻，鲁迅始终坚忍不拔，顽强战斗。他反对那种把革命看得简单、容易、一帆风顺，一遇到困难就“失望，颓废”的人。这就是鲁迅所坚持的“韧”性战斗精神，这也就是踏实苦干，百折不回，排除万难，不达目的决不罢休的革命坚定性。敌人对他的围攻和迫害，使他更加坚强。鲁迅的战斗精神，就是在敌人的围攻和迫害中锻炼出来的。鲁迅在乌云遮天的时候，在受到孤立的时候，他并不感到孤独。因为他是和人民大众同呼吸、共命运的，他是站在中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席一边的。当时，他表面上孤立，但是他代表了真理，代表了中国无产阶级和广大劳动人民的利益，代表了历史的前进方向。
    反动的围攻，锻炼出革命的左派，这是历史的辩证法。在无产阶级文化大革命中，左派同志都应该懂得这个道理，不怕曲折，不怕围攻，不怕孤立，自觉地在阶级斗争中千锤百炼，使自己成为坚强的钢铁战士。
    “俯首甘为孺子牛”，鲁迅相信人民，热爱人民。正因为这样，所以鲁迅善于发现社会的新生力量，坚决支持社会的新生力量。鲁迅在一生中，为社会的新生事物的发展，摇旗呐喊，鸣锣开道，为“造出大群的新的战士”不遗余力。他怀着满腔热忱，关怀着青年一代的成长，鼓舞着他们去战斗。从无产阶级身上，从人民大众身上，从革命青年身上，他看到了中国的希望和未来，从而增强了革命的信心和战斗的勇气。对社会的新生事物的态度，是支持，不支持，或者反对，这是革命，不革命，或者反对革命的一个重要标志。无产阶级革命家，在新生事物刚从地平线上冒出来的时候，就会看到它的无限生命力，看到它伟大的发展前途，就热烈欢呼，给予坚决的支持。而政治上的庸人，他们是瞎子，看不见新生事物，或者怕烧伤自己的手指，不敢予以支持。腐朽势力的代表人物，对新生事物则百般嘲笑，无情摧残。在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命的新生事物不断涌现，新生力量不断壮大，人们在他们面前，必须迅速表明态度，作出抉择。
    鲁迅最值得我们学习的，在于他对伟大领袖毛主席无比崇敬和热爱。他在早年曾有过“徬徨”，但是，当他找到了马克思主义，特别是找到了以毛主席为代表的中国共产党，找到了以毛主席为代表的革命路线之后，他就下定决心，俯首听命，甘愿做无产阶级革命的“马前卒”和“小兵”。鲁迅不顾国民党反动派的白色恐怖，不顾托洛茨基匪帮的造谣中伤，不顾周扬们的欺骗攻击，他始终坚定地跟着毛主席走，勇敢地捍卫以毛主席为代表的正确路线。
    “烈士暮年，壮心不已”。鲁迅越到晚年，革命意志越坚强，越显出战斗的青春活力。这是什么力量在鼓舞着他呢？这就是以毛主席为代表的中国共产党，这就是我们伟大的导师毛主席。真正的革命者，都要像鲁迅那样，坚决跟毛主席走，走到底，按照毛主席指引的方向前进。在今天，我们比鲁迅幸福多了，可以亲聆毛主席的教导。我们一定要干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书，学习一辈子毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席，忠于人民，忠于共产主义事业。
    我们的文化革命先驱鲁迅，离开我们三十年了，但是他的革命精神仍然活在每个革命同志的心中。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的惊涛骇浪中，需要用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级硬骨头，需要远见卓识、智勇双全的革命闯将。鲁迅的革命精神和他的斗争经验，是一份宝贵的财富。我们要遵照毛主席的教导，学习鲁迅的榜样，要用毛泽东思想作指导，继承和发扬鲁迅的敢于革命、善于革命，敢于斗争、善于斗争的精神。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
