The pastoral people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have created the seventeenth consecutive year of increased livestock production despite the unfavorable climate this year.

Over the past year, the pastures in the Tianshan Mountains, north and south, have completed the tasks of lambing and raising young animals, and fattening livestock. They have also carried out comprehensive work on livestock breeding, breed improvement, and disease prevention. The pastures of all people's communes are bustling with prosperity and vitality.

This year, Xinjiang's livestock industry has achieved increased production under unfavorable natural conditions. This is the result of the broad masses of commune members studying Chairman Mao's works and continuously promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. From last winter to May this year, the main pastoral areas of Xinjiang suffered a severe snowstorm, the likes of which had not been seen in decades, and the spring was unusually cold with prolonged snow cover. The people of all ethnic groups, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have overcome these adverse natural disasters and achieved victory.

    新疆夺得第十七个畜牧业增产年
    新疆各族牧民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在今年气候很不好的情况下，创造了第十七个畜牧业的增产年。
    一年来，天山南北各牧场在胜利地完成接羔育幼、牲畜抓膘之后，又全面地进行了牲畜配种、品种改良、兽疫防治等工作。各人民公社的牧场到处呈现出繁荣兴旺的大好形势。
    今年新疆的畜牧业在不利的自然条件下能够夺得增产，是广大社员大学毛主席著作，不断促进人的思想革命化的结果。去冬到今年五月，新疆主要牧区遭到几十年来未有的特大风雪灾害，而且春季严寒，积雪的时间太长。各族牧民，遵循毛主席的教导，战胜了这种恶劣的自然灾害，取得了胜利。
