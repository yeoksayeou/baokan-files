We are a group of Uighur Red Guards from the northwestern frontier of our motherland—Urumqi—who have come to Beijing to participate in revolutionary link-ups. We have come to Chairman Mao's side and participated in a meeting where Chairman Mao received us at Tiananmen. On the eve of National Day, we also watched several films of Chairman Mao receiving Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers, and we all felt extremely happy and excited!

Chairman Mao said: "In all the practical work of our Party, correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." In this unprecedented, world-shaking, great proletarian cultural revolution, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other leaders of the Central Committee, are closely united with the masses and with the hearts of all our nationalities. Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly received Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country. Each reception is a battle cry issued to us. Whether in front of Tiananmen or on the screen, as soon as we see Chairman Mao, we involuntarily shed tears of happiness. Whether in Xinjiang or in Beijing, whenever we think of Chairman Mao, we are filled with boundless love, faith, and admiration.

We are a group of children of poor and lower-middle peasants from the Uighur nationality. Our parents and grandparents have been generations of hired laborers exploited by landlords. When we think of that old society that devoured people, we love the Communist Party of China and our great leader Chairman Mao even more. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we young people might have ended up like our fathers and grandfathers, becoming beasts of burden for the landlords, and we would never have the present day. With the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, not only have we gone to university and come to Beijing, but most importantly, we have learned to be revolutionaries for life.

Chairman Mao teaches us young people: "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The future is in your hands." Our most beloved Chairman Mao, rest assured! We will not disappoint your expectations and will certainly inherit the cause of the revolutionary forerunners, forever safeguard our socialist iron rice bowl, and carry the revolution through to the end. We will do as you have taught us—to care about state affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Most beloved Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Uighur Red Guards who have come to Beijing, we pledge to you: We will certainly bring back the revolutionary spark you personally lit to Xinjiang and certainly convey your warm concern and teachings to the revolutionary masses at home. We will learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and like them, forever be loyal to you, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. In the great storms of revolutionary struggle, we will temper ourselves into successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

    把毛主席点燃的革命火种带回新疆
    维吾尔族一群红卫兵
    我们是从祖国西北边疆——乌鲁木齐，到北京来进行革命串连的维吾尔族红卫兵。我们来到了毛主席身边，参加了一次毛主席在天安门接见我们的大会。在国庆节前夕，我们又看到了毛主席几次接见红卫兵和革命师生的纪录片，大家感到无比幸福，无比激动！
    毛主席说：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”在这场史无前例的、震撼全世界的、伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，就是紧紧和群众在一起，和我们各族人民心连着心的。我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，一次再次地接见了各地来京的红卫兵和革命师生，每接见一次，就是对我们发出的一次战斗号令。不管是在天安门前还是在银幕上，我们一看到毛主席，就不知不觉地流下幸福的眼泪。我们无论是在新疆，还是在北京，一想起毛主席，就充满了无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情。
    我们是一群维吾尔族贫下中农的子弟，我们的父辈和祖辈，世世代代，都是受地主剥削的雇工。一想起那吃人的旧社会，我们就更加热爱中国共产党和我们伟大的领袖毛主席。如果没有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，我们这群年青人，恐怕早就像我们的父亲和祖父一样，给地主当牛马了，决不会有今天。有了党和毛主席的领导，我们不但上了大学，来到了北京，最重要的是我们懂得了要一辈子干革命的道理。
    毛主席教导我们青年说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”我们最敬爱的毛主席，您放心吧！我们决不辜负您的期望，一定要继承革命前辈的事业，永远保住我们社会主义的铁打江山，把革命进行到底。我们就是要照着您的教导去做——关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    最敬爱的毛主席，我们代表来京的维吾尔族红卫兵向您宣誓：一定要把您亲自点燃的革命火种带回新疆，一定要把您的亲切关怀和教导传达给家乡的革命群众。我们一定要向工农兵学习，要像工农兵一样，永远忠于您，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，在革命斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
