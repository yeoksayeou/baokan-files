	The Syrian People's Mobilization High Committee is led by Interior Minister Muhammad Ashawi, with members including Information Minister Muhammad Zuwabi and Chief of Staff Ahmad Swidani.

	The Syrian newspaper "Revolution" commented on this matter today, stating that revolutionary experience has shown that armed struggle by the people is very effective.

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 18 (Xinhua) - According to reports from local newspapers, Syrian Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin reiterated that the people's liberation war is the only way to liberate Palestine and the Arab homeland from imperialism, colonialism, and reactionary forces.

	Zu'ayyin made these remarks after the new cabinet was formed yesterday. He emphasized that Syria will support and assist the people's liberation movements. He condemned Israel as a base for imperialism and Zionism.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, Oct. 18 - The Syrian newspaper "Revolution" on October 18 condemned U.S. and British imperialists for supporting Israel's aggression against the Arab people and criticized the United Nations Security Council for discussing Israel's allegations of Syrian "aggression." The newspaper said that Israel dares to occupy Arab land, expel Arabs, and violate the United Nations Charter because it has the backing of the United States and Britain. The United States and Britain believe they have the right to plunder and enslave other peoples. If anyone does not acknowledge this right, they will be subjected to fierce attacks in the United Nations.

    叙利亚当局号召人民武装起来
    扎因总理重申人民解放战争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路
    新华社大马士革十九日电　据这里报纸今天报道，最近成立的叙利亚人民动员高级委员会号召叙利亚人民志愿参加人民武装，保卫家园不受帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派的侵略。
    叙利亚人民动员高级委员会的号召说，将由这个委员会去训练、组织和武装人民，从今天起将在全国成立约二十个登记站。
    叙利亚人民动员高级委员会是由内政部长穆罕默德·阿沙维领导的，成员中有新闻部长穆罕默德·祖瓦比、武装部队参谋长艾哈迈德·斯韦达尼等人。
    叙利亚《革命报》今天就这件事发表评论说，革命经验证明，人民武装斗争非常有用。全体人民应当参加人民武装，进行人民战争，解放巴勒斯坦和保卫叙利亚的三月八日革命。
    新华社大马士革十八日电　据此间报纸今天报道，叙利亚总理优素福·扎因重申，人民解放战争是从帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派手中解放巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯家园的唯一道路。
    扎因总理是在昨天组成新内阁后，向当地记者说这番话的。他强调说，叙利亚将支持和援助人民解放运动。他谴责以色列是帝国主义和犹太复国主义的基地。
    据新华社大马士革十八日电　叙利亚《革命报》十八日谴责美国和英国帝国主义者支持以色列侵略阿拉伯人民，并抨击联合国安全理事会竟然讨论以色列提出的所谓叙利亚“发动侵略”的控告。这家报纸说，以色列所以敢于霸占阿拉伯的土地，赶走阿拉伯人和违犯联合国宪章，是因为有美国和英国给它撑腰。美国和英国都认为它们有权利掠夺和奴役别国人民。如果有人不承认它们这种权利，他们就要在联合国里受到猛烈攻击。
