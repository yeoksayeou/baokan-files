A few years ago, we watched the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" in Shanghai. At that time, we enthusiastically cheered for the successful performance of this play, believing it to be a model opera for the revolutionization of Peking opera. This time, we watched the revised "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" in Beijing, and we truly felt that it had a new look. Both in terms of ideological and artistic aspects, it has significantly improved. This is the result of the Shanghai Revolutionary Peking Opera Troupe holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continuously revolutionizing. It is a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary bourgeois "authorities" and "experts" in the literary and artistic circles have always been against the revolutionization of Peking opera. They say that revolutionary modern plays are all about politics and lack artistic value, that there are too many red-faced heroes on stage, too many guns, and too much gunpowder... In short, they oppose the appearance of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage and the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought.

We workers, peasants, and soldiers have the opposite view. We believe that there were too many feudal, capitalist, and revisionist elements on the stage at that time. The appearance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and other revolutionary modern Peking operas swept away these rotten garbage. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken the stage of literature and art, and we have been able to hold our heads high. How could we not enthusiastically cheer for its achievements!

"The Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is good because it is highly political. It prominently promotes the great Mao Zedong Thought and sings the praises of the victory of the people's war. We workers, peasants, and soldiers evaluate the merits of a play primarily by its politics, by whether it sings the praises of Mao Zedong Thought. Art is always subordinate to politics. A play with strong artistic value, if it does not sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought and does not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will firmly oppose it! We need proletarian artistic value, a perfect unity of politics and art.

"The Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" prominently sings the praises of heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The brilliant images of Yang Zhirong, Shao Jianbo, and the collective heroism of the pursuit team on stage deeply educated us. Others, such as the family of the railway worker Li Yongqi, the family of the hunter, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Jiajiagou, all reflect the clear class feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are all the red-faced people we should sing the praises of. Those bourgeois "authorities" oppose the red-faced people occupying the stage, actually wanting those dirty black-faced people to occupy the stage. We workers, peasants, and soldiers will never agree to this!

"The Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly reflects the thought of the people's war, where the military and the people unite to annihilate the enemy, powerfully illustrating that only by taking up the revolutionary gun against the counter-revolutionary gun and consolidating our revolutionary base areas can we achieve revolutionary victory. The brave soldiers of the pursuit team and the people of Jiajiagou, armed with guns, annihilated Seatiger Mountain and defended the fruits of the revolution. This is a heartwarming event. Such guns and gunpowder are precisely what should be prominently displayed and more widely represented on the stage!

The success of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is something we heartily welcome, but for those demon-like creatures who attack revolutionary modern Peking opera, it is a heavy blow. This play was born in the struggle against class enemies. It once again proves that Chairman Mao's teachings of "without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress" are an unshakable truth. Without the great Mao Zedong Thought and without this sharp class struggle against the bourgeoisie, there would be no such excellent model opera as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy"!

    在斗争中诞生的戏

    前两年，我们在上海看过革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》，当时我们热烈地欢呼这出戏的演出成功，认为它是京剧革命化的样板戏。这次，我们在北京又看了经过加工修改后的《智取威虎山》，确实感到面貌一新，无论在思想性和艺术性上，都有显著的提高。这是上海革命京剧文工团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗不断革命的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    文艺界的反革命修正主义分子和反动的资产阶级“权威”“专家”们，一直是反对京剧革命的。他们说革命现代戏光是政治，没有艺术性，说什么舞台上的红脸英雄多了，枪杆子太多了，火药味太浓了……总之，他们就是反对在舞台上出现工农兵、宣传毛泽东思想。
    我们工农兵恰恰与他们的看法相反。我们认为，当时的舞台上封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的东西太多了。《智取威虎山》和其他一些革命现代京剧的出现，横扫了这些发霉的垃圾，工农兵登上了文艺舞台，我们扬眉吐气了，我们怎能不为它的成就热情欢呼呢！
    《智取威虎山》好就好在政治性强，它突出地宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想，歌颂了人民战争的胜利。我们工农兵评价一出戏的好坏，首要的标准是看政治，看它是不是歌颂了毛泽东思想。艺术永远是服从于政治的。一出艺术性再强的戏，如果它不歌颂毛泽东思想，不为工农兵服务，我们就坚决反对！我们需要的是无产阶级的艺术性，是政治和艺术的完美的统一。
    《智取威虎山》突出地歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物。舞台上的杨子荣、少剑波和追剿队的集体英雄主义的光辉形象，深刻地教育了我们。其他如铁路工人李勇奇的一家，常猎户一家，以及夹皮沟的贫下中农们，都反映了工农兵的爱憎分明的阶级感情，他们都是我们要歌颂的红脸人。那些资产阶级“权威”们反对红脸人占据舞台，实际上是要那些乌七八糟的黑脸人占据舞台。我们工农兵坚决不答应！
    《智取威虎山》生动地反映了军民一家齐心协力消灭敌人的人民战争思想，有力地说明只有拿起革命的枪杆子对付反革命的枪杆子，只有巩固我们的革命根据地，才能取得革命的胜利。追剿队的勇士们和夹皮沟的人民拿着枪杆子，消灭了座山雕，保卫了革命的胜利果实。这是大快人心的事。这样的枪杆子、火药味，不正是应该在舞台上大写特写、更多地表现的吗？
    《智取威虎山》的成功，我们拍手欢迎，但是对那些攻击革命现代京剧的牛鬼蛇神来说，却是一个最沉重的打击。这出戏是在和阶级敌人针锋相对的斗争中产生的。它又一次证明了，毛主席教导我们的不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行是一个颠扑不破的真理。没有伟大的毛泽东思想，没有这场反击资产阶级的尖锐的阶级斗争，就没有《智取威虎山》这样好的样板戏！
