    Talking Nonsense With Eyes Wide Open
    Sichuan Luzhou   Han Zhong, Zhi Rong, Qiu Quan

    Zhou Yang said, any class's art is "for all classes to see, to resonate with everyone."

    This is talking nonsense with eyes wide open.

    All the artists of the exploiting classes, their works must bear the stamp of their own class. No matter how they swear and vow, saying how they "serve all of humanity," "have no ulterior motives," and so on, they can talk until the cows come home. But turn around, and you can see that their butts are all stamped with their class's seal. Sometimes they expose some of the dark sides of the ruling class, but that is just like saying, "Master, your boots are too dirty, you should change them," and so on. In essence, it is cursing to help.

    What "serving the entire people," what "resonating with everyone," these are clichés that the bourgeoisie has sung countless times. Zhou Yang's "theory" is just another lie.

    睁着眼睛说瞎话
    四川泸州　汉忠　志荣　秋泉
    周扬说，任何一个阶级的艺术，都是“给所有阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣”。
    这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    一切剥削阶级的文艺家，他们的作品必然打着本阶级的烙印。尽管他们怎样发誓赌咒，说他们是如何“为全人类服务”呀，“没有功利目的”呀，等等，说得天花乱坠。可是，背过身来，就能发现他们屁股上都盖着本阶级的印章。有时他们也暴露一些统治阶级的阴暗面，那也不过是“老爷，您的靴子太脏了，该换一换了”之类的呵责，实质是小骂大帮忙。
    什么“为全体人民服务”，什么“引起所有人的共鸣”，这是资产阶级唱了无数次的滥调。周扬的“理论”，不过是又一次的说谎。
