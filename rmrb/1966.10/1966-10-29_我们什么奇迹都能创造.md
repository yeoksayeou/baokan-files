When we heard the news on the radio about our country successfully launching a nuclear missile, everyone's joy was indescribable. I clapped my hands and cheered, and sang "The East is Red" aloud.

Revolution is guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Our country's successful launch of a nuclear missile once again fully proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth, an invincible ideological weapon. I couldn't help but say, Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are so wise and great! Your words have the highest authority and the greatest power. Every word is a truth. Wherever it is applied, it works; wherever it is applied, it wins. Following your instructions will definitely lead to victory. We must shout loudly: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao, the reddest sun in our hearts! Long live, ten thousand times long live!

Our country's successful launch of a nuclear missile appeared during the high tide of the Cultural Revolution. This also proves that the powerful spiritual force of the Cultural Revolution has turned into a tremendous material force. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, any miracle can be created.

Currently, the United States and the Soviet Union are colluding, conspiring on the issue of so-called nuclear non-proliferation to maintain their nuclear monopoly and disrupt the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Our country's development of nuclear weapons is to oppose the nuclear monopoly and nuclear blackmail of the United States and the Soviet Union. We possess nuclear weapons to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and to safeguard world peace.

We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, the guards at the gates of Tiananmen Square by Chairman Mao's side. We will definitely stand at Tiananmen Square, with our hearts devoted to the motherland and our eyes on the world. We must, like the soldiers and workers, scientists, and all relevant personnel who participated in this test, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, further realize the revolutionization of our thinking, and dedicate our lives to the revolution. We must work hard to study the "Three Articles," truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and more firmly uphold politics, resolutely defend the ironclad stronghold of the proletariat. Whoever dares to harm a single hair of the Chinese people will have their backbone broken, and be thoroughly and completely eliminated.

    我们什么奇迹都能创造
    守卫天安门战士　卢燕财
    当我们从广播中听到我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的消息时，大家高兴的心情啊，真是无法形容。我一边拍手欢呼，一边放声地唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》。
    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我国这次发射导弹核武器试验成功，又充分证明了毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，是战无不胜的思想武器。我不由得说，毛主席啊，毛主席，您是多么英明伟大啊！您的话威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，用到那里那里灵，用到那里那里胜，照着您的指示去做，就一定胜利。我们要放声高呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！
    我国发射导弹核武器的试验成功，是在文化大革命的高潮中出现的。这也证明了文化大革命强大的精神力量，已经变成了巨大的物质力量。毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，什么人间奇迹都能创造。
    当前，美苏狼狈为奸，互相勾结，阴谋在所谓防止核扩散的问题上做交易，以保持他们的核垄断地位，破坏各国人民的革命斗争。我们国家发展核武器，就是为了反对美苏的核垄断和核讹诈，我们掌握核武器，就是为了支援世界各国人民的革命斗争，就是为了保卫世界和平。
    我们是毛泽东时代的青年，是天安门前毛主席身旁的警卫战士。我们一定站在天安门，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。我们要像参加这次试验的解放军指战员和工人、科学技术人员和其他一切有关人员那样，活学活用毛主席著作，进一步实现思想革命化，一心一意为革命而奋斗终生。我们要下功夫学“老三篇”，我们要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，更加坚定不移地突出政治，坚决保卫无产阶级铁打的江山。谁敢动中国人民一根毫毛，就打断它的脊梁骨，干净彻底地消灭它。
