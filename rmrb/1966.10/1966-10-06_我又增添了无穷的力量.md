Title: I Have Gained Infinite Strength Again

I have gained infinite strength again. On October 1st, I saw our great leader Chairman Mao again. Seeing Chairman Mao in such good health, I felt genuinely happy from the bottom of my heart. This is a great joy for all the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world!

This is the seventeenth time I have seen Chairman Mao. Each time I see Chairman Mao, my whole body gains infinite strength.

March 28, 1958, is a day I will never forget. On that day, Chairman Mao came to our Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. He saw more than thirty people struggling to lift a steel plate in the large rolling mill and asked with concern: "Can we not mechanize the transportation?"

Chairman Mao's words flowed through my entire body like a warm current. I thought with tears in my eyes: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You lead the people of the entire nation in revolution, and you have to handle so many state affairs, yet you still care about our workers' labor. Please rest assured, Chairman Mao, we will definitely carry out your instructions to the letter.

We quickly established a mechanization group and started working on mechanized transportation. In the past, some engineering and technical personnel spent 700,000 yuan over more than two years and still couldn't achieve it. This time, as soon as we started, a technician brought over a pile of thick books with hard covers and tried to intimidate us, saying: "Even if you read ten thousand books, you won't find the solution to the problem." We thought: This is what Chairman Mao instructed us to do, we dare to face any hardship, a few thick books won't scare us!

Without blueprints, we designed them ourselves; without equipment, we made them ourselves; when encountering difficulties, we learned from "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." As a result, we spent only over 30,000 yuan and two months, and on the Party's birthday, July 1st, we implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, freeing over 500 class brothers from the heavy physical labor of carrying steel plates.

Since then, we have reviewed Chairman Mao's instructions from 1958 every year, and the oath we made at that time: Study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, do revolution for a lifetime, and innovate technology for a lifetime. Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's instructions, every July 1st, we carry out the most arduous and meaningful technological innovation as a gift to the Party's birthday.

Bourgeois technical "authorities" can't draw design plans without foreign books. We can't innovate technology if we don't study Chairman Mao's works well. We draw infinite courage, wisdom, and strength from Chairman Mao's works. Last year, before July 1st, when we were mechanizing the coke bin, we needed to lift an 80-ton steel frame, but we didn't have a crane. What should we do? We repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and finally came up with the idea of "Ants Toppling a Mountain," using many jacks to lift the steel frame. From such examples, we deeply feel that whether it is class struggle, production struggle, or scientific experiments, as long as we seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, we will be invincible.

    我又增添了无穷的力量
    全国人民代表大会代表  重庆钢铁公司副总工程师  黄荣昌
    十月一日，我又见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席。看到毛主席身体那么健康，我打心眼里感到高兴。这是全中国、全世界革命人民的大喜事啊！
    我已经十七次见到毛主席了。每见一次毛主席，浑身都增添无穷的力量。
    一九五八年三月二十八日，是我终生最难忘的日子。那一天，毛主席来到了我们重钢。他老人家在大型轧钢车间看到三十多个人抬一块钢板，很费力气，便关切地说：可不可以搞小型机械化运输呢？
    毛主席的话，像一股暖流，传遍了我的全身。我含着眼泪想：毛主席呀，毛主席！您老人家领导全国人民闹革命，要操劳多少国家大事，还惦记着我们工人的劳动。请您老人家放心，我们一定不折不扣地实现您的指示。
    我们很快成立了机械化小组，搞起运输机械化来。过去，有些工程技术人员花了七十万元，搞了两年多也没有搞成。这次，我们一动手搞，有个技术人员抱来一大堆硬壳壳的大本书，吓唬我们说：“读破万卷书，也找不到解决问题的边。”我们想：这是毛主席指示我们搞的，刀山火海也敢上，几本硬壳书还能吓倒我们？！
    没有图纸，我们自己设计；没有设备，我们自己制造；遇到困难，就学《愚公移山》。结果，只花了三万多元，两个多月，在“七一”党的生日，我们就实现了毛主席的指示，把五百多个阶级兄弟从抬钢板的笨重体力劳动中解放出来。
    以后，我们年年都要重温毛主席在一九五八年的指示，重温我们当时立下的誓言：学一辈子毛主席著作，干一辈子革命，搞一辈子技术革新。在毛主席的指示的鼓舞下，每年“七一”，我们都搞出一项最艰巨、最有意义的技术革新，作为向党的生日的献礼。
    资产阶级技术“权威”，离开外国书本就画不出设计图来。我们是学不好毛主席著作，就搞不出技术革新。我们从毛主席著作中汲取了无穷的勇气、智慧和力量。去年“七一”前，我们在搞焦炭料槽机械化的时候，要把八十吨重的钢架吊起来，没有起重机，怎么办？我们就反复学习《愚公移山》，终于想出“蚂蚁顶泰山”的办法，用许多千斤顶把钢架顶了上去。从这样的许多事例中，我们深切体会到：无论是搞阶级斗争，生产斗争，还是科学实验，只要认真活学活用毛主席著作，就会无往而不胜。
