With Mao Zedong Thought, There Is No Enemy That Cannot Be Defeated

Dearest Party Central Committee,
Dearest Chairman Mao:

The news of our country successfully testing missiles and nuclear weapons has filled us with boundless excitement and joy! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism, and a great boost to the morale of the revolutionary people around the world, while striking down the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

The success of this missile and nuclear weapons test is a source of pride for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. It shows that with Mao Zedong Thought, there is no problem that cannot be solved, no difficulty that cannot be overcome, and no enemy that cannot be defeated. We must love Mao Zedong Thought even more, believe in it even more firmly, and under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to scale new heights that no one has ever reached before.

Inspired by this great achievement, we must further respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must study diligently and apply what we learn earnestly, arming our minds firmly with Mao Zedong Thought.

We enthusiastically hail: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live! Ten thousand years live!

    有了毛泽东思想就没有战胜不了的敌人
    最敬爱的党中央
    最敬爱的毛主席：
    我国发射导弹核武器试验成功的喜讯传来后，我们的心情无限兴奋，无限激动！这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的沉重打击，大大长了世界革命人民的志气，灭了帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派的威风。
    这次导弹核武器试验的成功，是中国人民的骄傲，是世界革命人民的骄傲。它说明，有了毛泽东思想就没有解决不了的问题，没有克服不了的困难，没有战胜不了的敌人。我们要更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加坚信毛泽东思想，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，继续攀登前人没有攀登过的世界高峰。
    在这一巨大新成就的鼓舞下，我们要更进一步响应林彪副主席的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，勤学勤用，刻苦地学，刻苦地用，用毛泽东思想把我们的头脑牢牢地武装起来。
    我们热烈地欢呼：战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
