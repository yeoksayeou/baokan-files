Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union, numbering over forty, on the 26th overcame numerous obstacles imposed by the Soviet authorities and, in Moscow's Red Square, paid their respects to the great leaders of the proletarian revolution and teachers, Lenin and Stalin, by laying wreaths.

On the eve of their departure from the Soviet Union, the Chinese students, filled with deep admiration for the great leaders of the proletariat, wished to once again pay their respects to Lenin's remains and Stalin's tomb. On the 25th, they made an appointment with Colonel Maschkov of the Lenin Mausoleum management to lay wreaths at 11:00 AM on the 26th and also informed the Soviet Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education of this matter.

However, at 10:50 AM on the 26th, when the Chinese students, carrying wreaths, approached the entrance to Red Square, they found that the area around Red Square was filled with police and iron railings, and all entrances were blocked. After the Chinese student representative explained their purpose to the Soviet police, a police lieutenant colonel replied, "The Lenin Mausoleum is under repair and cannot let you in." The student representative immediately pointed out that this had been agreed upon with Colonel Maschkov the day before and that laying wreaths would not interfere with the repair work. The lieutenant colonel evaded the issue by saying he needed to "consult." After more than half an hour, he replied, "It's still not possible. Colonel Maschkov did not understand the situation at the time." Another duty officer said, "Colonel Maschkov is not here today, and he did not give any instructions on this matter." At this point, the Chinese student representative pointed out that this was a deliberate obstruction and insisted that the Soviet side fulfill its responsibilities and promises. The lieutenant colonel, feeling guilty and at a loss for words, "consulted" for another hour, finally allowing only four or five students carrying wreaths to enter, while the rest were not allowed into Red Square. The Chinese students insisted on their legitimate demands, insisting that the entire group be allowed to enter to lay wreaths at Lenin's and Stalin's tombs. The lieutenant colonel, after another "consultation," was forced to agree but continued to create obstacles according to "instructions from above" regarding how the students should enter. Finally, at 2:00 PM, the Soviet side allowed the entire group of students to enter Red Square in a large car, but did not allow them to march in formation, and also sent a police car to lead the way.

After the students arrived by car at the left side of the Lenin Mausoleum and got off, they found that Colonel Maschkov was present. This colonel did not allow the students to place the wreaths separately in front of the Lenin Mausoleum and on Stalin's tomb, but only allowed them to be placed on the viewing platform to the left of the Lenin Mausoleum, and did not allow them to view Lenin's remains or Stalin's tomb.

The Chinese student representative protested the Soviet authorities' unreasonable obstruction and harassment. They pointed out to Colonel Maschkov, "We come with deep respect and love for the great Lenin and the great Stalin to lay wreaths. You agreed to assist us yesterday, but today you obstruct us in every way, causing us to spend three whole hours, and in the end, we still cannot view Lenin's remains or Stalin's tomb. We strongly protest this."

During the more than three-hour negotiation, hundreds of Moscow residents continuously gathered around the Chinese students and the two wreaths to watch. Some Soviet residents expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet authorities' unreasonable obstruction and harassment. Some said, "Why not let the Chinese students lay wreaths?" Others said, "Why not let them in?" "Probably because they want to lay wreaths for Stalin." "Why can't they lay wreaths for Stalin? If there is a Stalin tomb, they can lay wreaths!" A Soviet young woman said, "The Chinese students want to lay wreaths for Stalin, well done!" A few Georgians told the Chinese students, "We represent the Georgian people in saluting the Chinese people!"

During the more than three-hour negotiation, people saw that there were police at each entrance to Red Square, and the security was tight. There were also two large cars full of police parked at both ends of Red Square.

After the Chinese students left, the police and iron railings around Red Square were immediately removed. (Accompanied by a picture)

    我留苏学生回国前向列宁斯大林墓敬献花圈
    苏联当局竟出动警察封锁红场百般刁难
    我国学生进行了三个多小时的严正交涉，才被允许进入红场，把花圈放在列宁陵墓左侧观礼台前，但仍不能瞻仰列宁遗容和斯大林墓。数百名莫斯科居民目击中国学生受阻情况，对苏联当局的无理行动表示不满。
    新华社莫斯科二十七日电　中国留苏学生四十余人二十六日克服了苏联当局的重重阻挠，在莫斯科红场向伟大的无产阶级革命领袖和导师列宁的陵墓和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林墓敬献了花圈。
    中国留苏学生在向苏联人民告别的前夕，怀着对无产阶级伟大领袖无限敬仰的心情，很想再次瞻仰列宁的遗容和斯大林墓。他们在二十五日同列宁陵墓管理处的马施柯夫上校约定，在二十六日上午十一点前去敬献花圈，并同时将敬献花圈一事通知了苏联高等和中等专业教育部。
    但是，在二十六日上午十点五十分，当中国留学生抬着花圈列队走到红场入口处时，发现红场周围已布满警察和铁栅栏。所有入口都被封锁了。中国留学生代表向苏联警察说明来意后，一个警察中校回答说：“列宁陵墓正在修理，不能放你们进去。”学生代表当即指出：这是昨天同马施柯夫上校商定过的，而且献花圈并不妨碍修理工作。这个中校推托说要“请示”。过了半个多小时，他回答说：“还是不行，马施柯夫上校当时不了解情况。”另一位值班员说：“马施柯夫上校今天不在，他也没有交待过这件事。”这时，中国留学生代表指出，这是苏方故意刁难，并坚持要求苏方履行自己的职责和诺言。那个中校感到理亏词穷，又“请示”了一个多小时，结果只允许四、五名抬花圈的学生进去，其余学生一概不准进红场。中国留学生坚持正当要求，要全体进去向列宁和斯大林墓敬献花圈。那个中校又“请示”一番后被迫答应，但又按照上边的“指示”在留学生怎样入场的问题上进行了长时间的刁难。最后，直到十四点整，苏方才允许全体学生乘一辆大轿车进入红场，但不许列队步行进去，还用一辆警车在前“引路”。
    学生们乘大轿车到达列宁陵墓左侧下车后，发现那个马施柯夫上校原来在场。这个上校不许学生把花圈分别放置在列宁陵墓前和斯大林墓上，只许放在列宁陵墓左侧的观礼台前，更不许去瞻仰列宁遗容和斯大林墓。
    中国留学生代表对苏联当局的这种无理阻挠和刁难提出了抗议。他们向马施柯夫上校指出：“我们是怀着对伟大的列宁和伟大的斯大林的无限尊敬和热爱来敬献花圈的。你们昨天答应协助我们，但是今天却百般阻挠，使我们整整花费了三个小时，最后还不能瞻仰列宁遗容和斯大林墓。对此，我们向你们提出强烈抗议。”
    在三个多小时交涉过程中，有数百名莫斯科居民络绎不绝地围着中国留学生和两个花圈观看。有的苏联居民对苏联当局这种无理阻挠和刁难表示不满。有的说：“为什么不让中国学生献花圈？”有的说：“为什么不放他们进去？”“大概是因为他们要给斯大林献花圈。”“为什么不能给斯大林献花圈？有斯大林墓，就可以献嘛！”一位苏联女青年说：“中国学生要给斯大林献花圈，好样的！”有几个格鲁吉亚人对中国留学生说：“我们代表格鲁吉亚人民向中国人民致敬！”
    在三个多小时交涉过程中，人们看到，红场各入口处都有警察，戒备森严。红场两端还停着两辆满装警察的大轿车。
    当中国学生走了之后，红场周围的警察和铁栅栏便立即撤除了。（附图片）
