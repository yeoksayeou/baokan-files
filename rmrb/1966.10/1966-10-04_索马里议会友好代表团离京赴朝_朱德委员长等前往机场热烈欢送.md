The Somali Parliamentary Friendship Delegation, led by the Speaker of the Somali National Assembly, Sheikh Mukhtar Muhammad Hussein, concluded their friendly visit to China today. In the morning, they boarded a special plane to depart from Beijing and head to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a visit.

Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, including Chairman Ju De, Vice Chairmen Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Liu Ningyi, and Zhou Jianren, Deputy Foreign Minister Qi Pengfei, and other relevant officials, as well as over a thousand people from various sectors of the capital, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

Under the bright sunshine, the Beijing airport was adorned with the national flags of both China and Somalia. Before the plane took off, Chairman Ju De and other officials accompanied the guests around the field to bid farewell to the crowd. At this moment, the crowd enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia!" A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to the guests.

Somali experts and students in Beijing, as well as the acting charge d'affaires of the North Korean Embassy in China, Kim Jae-suk, also came to the airport to see them off.
