"Chairman Mao has come!" "Chairman Mao has come!" The fifty-mile red road resounded with cheers, shaking the earth and mountains. People held up the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times, ten thousand times!" Faces flushed with excitement, hearts burning with passion, all turned towards the sun in our hearts, the reddest sun. Millions of Red Guards and revolutionary students expressed a common wish: to defend and carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to thoroughly criticize and resolutely oppose the bourgeois reactionary line, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Lin Biao and the great leader Chairman Mao reviewed the cultural revolution army together. Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, his best student, and the best example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must learn from Comrade Lin Biao, learn from him in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in consistently propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought.

Thousands of needles and threads cannot express the boundless love, boundless respect, and boundless admiration for Chairman Mao. Red Guards from the revolutionary base area of Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, stitched the red flag of "Red Guards of the Jinggangshan Area" through the night, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao, and accepting the review of the great leader Chairman Mao.

    毛主席万岁！人民万岁！
    “毛主席来了！”“毛主席来了！”
    五十里红色大道上，欢声雷动，地撼山摇。人们举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一张张激动的脸，一颗颗火热的心，向着我们心中最红最红的太阳。千千万万个红卫兵和革命师生表示共同的心愿：誓死保卫和贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判和坚决反对资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。　　　　本报记者摄
    林彪同志和伟大领袖毛主席一起检阅文化革命大军。林彪同志是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，是活学活用毛主席著作最好的榜样。我们一定要向林彪同志学习，学习他高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，始终不渝地宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。

    千针万线，难以表达对毛主席的无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限崇拜的心情。来自江西省永新县革命老根据地的红卫兵，连夜绣起“井冈山地区红卫兵”的红旗，高举毛主席画像，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。
