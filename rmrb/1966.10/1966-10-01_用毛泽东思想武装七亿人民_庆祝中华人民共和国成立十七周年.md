Our great leader Chairman Mao personally founded the People's Republic of China, which has now celebrated its 17th anniversary.

Seventeen years is but a brief moment in human history. However, on this land of China, tremendous changes have taken place. A country of seven hundred million people, once a backward nation subjected to bullying and carving up, has leaped forward to become a great socialist advanced nation, standing tall in the East like a giant. New China, bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, has become the center of longing for revolutionary people around the world.

Over the past seventeen years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our people have achieved tremendous victories in all fronts of the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, has pushed our socialist revolution to a new stage. The storm of the cultural revolution is sweeping the nation, shaking the entire world.

With the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres as the main force, tens of millions of people have launched a comprehensive and fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who have infiltrated the Party, on the ghosts and monsters in society, and on the strongholds of the bourgeoisie. Those bourgeois rightists, who were so arrogant not long ago, have now been one by one dragged out by the revolutionary masses, their past glory swept away.

The brave Red Guards have marched from schools to the streets, smashing the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, and establishing the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat. They have thoroughly defeated the remnants and dregs of the old society, and the old rules and customs, leaving them in tatters.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses are studying the works of Chairman Mao. Everywhere, there is a red sea of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and everywhere, there are loud voices reciting Chairman Mao's works. People learn in struggle and use what they learn in struggle, making the cultural revolution the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Great Mao Zedong Thought has unleashed the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity hidden within the hundreds of millions of people, like the release of atomic energy. Daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, daring to do, and daring to make revolution have become the style of our times. Our young generation is rapidly growing and tempering itself in the great storms of revolution.

The revolutionary upsurge has promoted a production and construction upsurge. In the midst of the cultural revolution, our national economy is presenting a new situation of all-around leaps forward.

The People's Liberation Army is advancing further on the road of proletarian revolutionization and militarization. Our national defense forces are invincible.

Our people have honorably fulfilled their internationalist duties in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party, and in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world against imperialism.

Our people have never been as spirited as they are today. Our beloved motherland has never been as prosperous and flourishing as it is today.

"Class struggle, once grasped, is all-powerful." All the achievements and victories we have gained prove the absolute correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant judgment.

Comrade Mao Zedong has long pointed out that throughout the entire historical period of socialism, there exists class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. The overthrown bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes are not reconciled to their defeat. They infiltrate the Party through a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, utilizing their old strongholds in the ideological and cultural spheres, attempting to achieve a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong is aimed at seizing the strongholds in the ideological and cultural spheres occupied by the exploiting classes, smashing the plots of capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and enabling our country to advance along the socialist and communist road in accordance with historical laws.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution to uproot all systems of exploitation, to uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism, it is bound to encounter the frenzied resistance of class enemies and obstacles from various quarters.

The enemies of the proletariat continue to resist the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in various ways. They even wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, deceiving and misleading a part of the masses, attempting to strike at the revolutionary forces of the proletariat, attempting to "shell" our proletarian revolutionary headquarters. We must be on guard against this, expose their tricks, and further rely on the masses, trust the masses, and mobilize the masses more boldly, so that the enemies' plots will never succeed in the face of the increasingly awakened masses.

There are also some people who still do not understand the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and are still afraid of the mass movement. They talk about the Sixteen Points but act contrary to them. They consciously or unconsciously practice sectarianism, using the boundless love of the broad masses for the Party and Chairman Mao to create situations where part of the workers and peasants oppose revolutionary students, leading to scenes of masses fighting masses and students fighting students. By doing so, they provide opportunities for the enemies of the proletariat to fish in troubled waters. We have good intentions in hoping that these people will correct their mistakes. If they insist on not changing, they will drift away from the people and inevitably slide onto the capitalist road.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee called on the entire Party and the nation to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. The plenary session's communiqué pointed out, "Arming the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and broad cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, further promoting the ideological revolution of the people, is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and achieve victory for our socialist and communist cause."

We must resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. We must consciously grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon of the proletariat, to answer and solve various problems in the cultural revolution. We must resolutely defend and implement the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, defend and implement the decisions of the Party Central Committee on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, that is, the Sixteen Points, and defend and implement the proletarian revolutionary line.

Now, the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Communist Party, and the reactionaries of various countries are in a state of hysterical frenzy. They have maliciously slandered, distorted, instigated, and defamed our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In their anti-China chorus, they are shouting at the top of their lungs, competing to see who can sing the highest tune. In fact, the barking of these gentlemen only covers up their inner fear.

Gentlemen, you have pinned your hopes on "peaceful evolution" on our young generation, but unfortunately, you have miscalculated! It is precisely the great cultural revolution that has tempered and forged our millions and tens of millions of young people into the strongest warriors against imperialism and revisionism. You, the historical garbage, will surely be swept away by the revolutionary people of the whole world.

The Chinese Communist Party's daring to carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a manifestation of our strength, a strong manifestation, a confident manifestation. Imperialists and revisionists, you boast about democracy and freedom, so let the masses have a big debate, big-character posters, and big discussions! Do you have the courage?

We warn the American imperialists and their accomplices to behave yourselves. If you act rashly and force war upon us, awaiting you will be the highly awakened people of China, several million brave and skilled People's Liberation Army soldiers, and hundreds of millions of militia and Red Guards who are the strong rear guard of the People's Liberation Army!

The Chinese people will continue to hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, together with the people of the world, form an irresistible broad united front against American imperialism, strongly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and fight until the final victory.

We firmly support the revolution of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all countries of the world, and together with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the world, carry the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys to the end, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party to the end!

The seven hundred million people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    用毛泽东思想武装七亿人民
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的中华人民共和国，诞生十七周年了。
    十七年，在人类历史上，只是短暂的一瞬。但是，在中国这块土地上，却发生了翻天覆地的变化。七亿人口的大国，由一个受尽欺凌、任人宰割的落后国家，一跃而为伟大的社会主义先进国家，像巨人一般屹立在世界的东方。毛泽东思想阳光照耀下的新中国，成为世界革命人民向往的中心。
    十七年来，我国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上，都取得了突飞猛进的胜利。
    毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，又把我国社会主义革命推进到一个新阶段。文化革命的大风暴，正在席卷全国，震动着整个世界。
    以广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部为主力军的亿万群众，对那些混进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对社会上的牛鬼蛇神，对资产阶级的顽固堡垒，展开了全面的猛烈的攻击。那些资产阶级右派老爷们，不久以前还是那么神气。曾几何时，他们一个一个地被革命群众揪出来，昔日威风，扫地以尽。
    英勇的革命红卫兵们，从学校走上街头，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。他们把旧社会遗留下来的许多残渣余孽，许多陈规陋习，打得个落花流水。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众大学毛主席著作。到处都是《毛主席语录》的红色海洋，到处都是诵读毛主席著作的响亮声音。人们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把文化革命当作活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，使蕴藏在亿万人民中的革命积极性和创造性，像原子能一样迸发出来。敢想，敢说，敢闯，敢干，敢革命，成了我们时代的风格。我国年青一代，正在革命的大风大浪中迅速锻炼成长。
    革命高潮促进了生产建设的高潮。在文化革命中，我国国民经济正在出现全面跃进的新局面。
    人民解放军进一步地在无产阶级革命化、战斗化的道路上阔步前进。我们的国防力量是无敌的。
    我国人民在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，在支援越南人民抗美救国战争和世界人民反帝革命斗争中，无愧地尽了无产阶级国际主义的义务。
    我国人民从来没有像今天这样意气风发。我们可爱的祖国从来没有像今天这样繁荣兴旺。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”我们所取得的一切成就和胜利，都证明了毛泽东同志这一英明论断的无比正确性。
    毛泽东同志早就指出，在整个社会主义的历史时期，存在着无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。被推翻了的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级，对他们的失败是不甘心的。他们通过钻进共产党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，利用自己在思想文化领域里所占有的老阵地，妄图实现资本主义反革命复辟。毛泽东同志发动和领导的这场文化大革命，就是为着夺取剥削阶级在思想文化领域里所占领的阵地，粉碎资本主义反革命复辟的阴谋，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，使我国能够在社会主义、共产主义的道路上，合乎历史规律地前进。
    无产阶级文化大革命，既然是挖一切剥削制度，挖资本主义、修正主义根子的革命，就必然会遇到阶级敌人的疯狂反抗，遇到来自各方面的阻力。
    无产阶级的敌人，继续在用各种方式对抗无产阶级文化大革命。他们甚至打着“红旗”反红旗，欺骗和蒙蔽一部分群众，妄图打击无产阶级革命派，妄图“炮打”我们无产阶级革命的司令部。对此，我们必须提高警惕，识破他们，并且要更加依靠群众，信任群众，进一步地放手发动群众，使敌人的阴谋，在广大群众日益觉悟的情况下，永远不能得逞。
    另有一些人，他们对于以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线至今还很不理解，对群众运动仍然是“怕”字当头。他们口头上也讲十六条，在行动上却离开十六条。他们自觉地或者不自觉地搞宗派主义，利用广大群众对党和毛主席的无限热爱，制造一部分工农群众反对革命学生，造成群众斗群众、学生斗学生的一些局面。他们这样做，正好为无产阶级的敌人利用来混水摸鱼。我们对这些人，本来是好心善意地希望他们改正错误。他们如果坚持不改，就会脱离人民，结果就必然滑到资本主义的道路上去。
    党的八届十一中全会，号召全党全国大学毛泽东同志的著作。全会公报指出，“用毛泽东思想武装工农兵群众、革命知识分子和广大干部，进一步促进人的思想革命化，是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，使我们社会主义和共产主义事业取得胜利的最可靠、最根本的保证。”
    我们要坚决响应党中央的号召，在文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的高潮。我们要很自觉地掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的无产阶级思想武器，去回答和解决文化革命中的各种问题。我们要坚决地捍卫和执行毛泽东同志的指示，捍卫和执行党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，即十六条，捍卫和执行无产阶级的革命路线。
    现在，以美国为首的帝国主义者、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派，正在歇斯底里大发作。他们对我国无产阶级文化大革命，极尽污蔑、歪曲、挑拨、诽谤之能事。他们在反华大合唱中，声嘶力竭，比赛看谁的调子高。其实，这些老爷们的狂吠，并不能掩盖他们内心的恐惧。
    先生们，你们不是把“和平演变”的希望寄托在我们年青一代身上吗？可惜，你们的算盘打错了！正是伟大的文化革命，把我们千千万万年青的一代，锻炼和造就成为反帝反修最坚强的战士。你们这些历史垃圾，总会被全世界革命人民扫得一干二净的。
    中国共产党敢于进行这场无产阶级文化大革命，是我们的力量的表现，强大的表现，自信的表现。帝国主义、修正主义的老爷们，你们不是标榜什么民主、自由吗？那末，你们也让群众来个大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论吧！你们有这种胆量吗？
    我们警告美帝国主义及其帮凶，你们放老实一点。你们如果轻举妄动，把战争强加在我们头上，等待着你们的，将是高度觉悟了的中国人民，将是几百万英勇善战的人民解放军，将是作为人民解放军强大后盾的亿万民兵和红卫兵！
    中国人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，同全世界人民一道，结成一个势不可当的广泛的反对美帝国主义的统一战线，强有力地支持越南人民抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利。
    我们坚决支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命，同全世界一切马克思列宁主义者和一切革命人民一道，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿人民，所向无敌！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
