Once, during an emergency assembly, I was hurriedly packing my bag and accidentally fell from the upper bunk. The fall left me dizzy and seeing stars, and I was sprawled on the ground. I thought: I won't go to this assembly; the leadership won't criticize me for this. But seeing my comrades hurriedly packing their bags, as if ready for battle, my mind started to race: If this were a real battle, should I go? If I were wounded on the battlefield, would I still fight? Our old company commander, Zhang Chunli, was wounded seven times in battle and never left the front lines. I only fell lightly; what reason do I have not to go? No, I must go, I definitely must go! Chairman Mao said: "Have the courage to face any difficulties and to overcome all hardships to win victory." How can a soldier of Chairman Mao's be afraid of difficulties?

Thinking this, I quickly got up and hurriedly packed my bag, setting off with my comrades.

This emergency assembly made me understand the way to face difficulties: one must have a resolute mind. Being resolute can overcome all fears. Fear comes from selfishness. With resolve, one can overcome selfishness and thus overcome fear. Therefore, in our struggle to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, we must have that resolute spirit.

    破私立公要有股“硬”劲
    战士  张进京
    有一次紧急集合，我急着打背包，一不小心从床上层摔了下来，摔得我脑袋发懵，两眼发花，趴在地上。我想：这次集合不去了，领导也不会批评我的。可是看到同志们都在急速地打背包，好像要上阵的样子，我的脑子里又翻腾起来：如果这是去打仗，该不该去？如果是在战场上负了伤，还打不打？老连长张春礼，在战斗中身负七处重伤，仍然不下火线，我只不过是轻轻地摔了一下，有什么理由不去？不行，要去，一定要去！毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”做一个毛主席的战士怎么能怕困难呢？
    想到这里，我一骨碌爬起来，迅速地打起背包，和同志们一起出发了。
    这次紧急集合，使我懂得了对待困难的办法，就是思想上要装一个“硬”字。一“硬”能破百“怕”。“怕”字从“私”字来，有了“硬”劲，破了“私”字，也就破了“怕”字。因此，我们在破私立公的斗争中，一定要有股“硬”劲。
