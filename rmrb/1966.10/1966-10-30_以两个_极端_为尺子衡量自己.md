Since the socialist education movement began in our brigade in the spring of 1965, I and the other brigade cadres have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and paid special attention to studying the "Three Articles" to work hard on transforming our world outlook.

To transform one's world outlook, one must first grasp living thoughts. At that time, the most prominent thought problem among our brigade cadres was that they found it hard to accept criticism from the commune members. I was the same. During the socialist education movement, the masses, with a high sense of responsibility to the revolution, criticized some of my wrong thoughts and actions. I felt wronged and lost face. I thought it over and over again and found it not worthwhile, so I became passive in my work and even did not want to be a cadre anymore. One day, I went to the leading comrades and said, "Let's change jobs. It's only fair if everyone gets a taste of being a cadre."

The leading comrades asked me, "Why?"

I replied, "Working hard and getting a body full of sores isn't worth it."

"Sores need to be treated!" the leading comrades said. "The masses' criticisms are help and care for cadres, fearing that cadres might go wrong. If there are no sores, prevention is needed; if there are sores, they must be treated. Others help by cutting them open, though it hurts a bit, it will be comfortable later." They also said, "Study Chairman Mao's works and compare them with your thoughts. See what kind of thoughts you have."

I went home and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. This time, I studied it with a problem in mind and compared my thoughts with it, and I felt that every word Chairman Mao said was especially close to me, and every word seemed to be said to me. When I read "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticisms and corrections," my thoughts became clearer. Therefore, I made a self-criticism of my mistakes at big and small meetings. Old farmer Hu Decheng once criticized me for having labor power at home and letting a student help me harvest wheat from my private plot. At that time, I thought that I was a military family member, so how could I not let the student help. After this study, I realized that I was a cadre and had labor power, so it was wrong to let the student help harvest the wheat. My brother enlisting in the army was his duty, and I should not use the name of a military family member to seek special treatment. I then made a self-criticism at the masses' meeting. The masses said I had changed! I myself also felt light-hearted.

Just improving my own thoughts is not enough; I must also make the thoughts of all Party members in the branch revolutionary. Therefore, I and the branch committee members and all Party members studied the two "extremes" (extreme responsibility to work and extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people), the "five types of people" (noble people, pure people, people with integrity, people who have gotten rid of vulgar interests, and people who benefit the people), and the "eight characters" (selflessly serving the people) in the "Three Articles" repeatedly. We used these as a yardstick to examine our thoughts, fiercely struggled against the "I," and established a world outlook of completely and thoroughly serving the people.

At the same time, we also made two comparisons: first, we compared ourselves with the great images of White, Zhang, and the old man who moved the mountain. After comparing, we felt very small. Everyone said: White was selflessly serving the people, Zhang died for the people and was heavier than Tai Mountain, the old man was not afraid of difficulties and dared to think and do, but we were selfish, could not accept others' opinions, and did not want to throw away our own burdens. What kind of Communist Party members are we? Then, we compared ourselves with revolutionary martyrs. After comparing, we felt that our selfishness was too heavy. Everyone said: Revolutionary martyrs shed blood for the people, sacrificed their heads, and dared to jump into boiling water and tread on sharp swords. Now, when the masses give us a little criticism, we feel wronged and want to change jobs. In fact, this is rejecting progress. After such comparisons, everyone's awareness was raised. Many comrades thought of the bitterness of the old society and said excitedly: In the old society, the fake village heads oppressed the poor like wolves, and we dared not lift our heads when walking and dared not speak loudly. How could we dare to give them opinions? Now the people are the masters, and we can hold our heads high and speak out. The people have the right to speak and the responsibility to supervise cadres. We cadres must listen to the masses' opinions and serve the people well!

After recalling and comparing, the comrades said: "Now it seems that although we have joined the Party organizationally, our thoughts have not completely joined the Party; our bodies are sitting on the socialist wagon, but our minds still have 'private goods.' In the future, we must use Chairman Mao's works as a treasure and work hard to transform our world outlook and dedicate everything to the revolution."

    以两个“极端”为尺子衡量自己
    河南信阳县明港公社尚河大队党支部书记　邱从发
    一九六五年春天，我们大队进行社会主义教育运动以来，我和大队干部，都能坚持学习毛主席著作，并注意通过学习“老三篇”，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    要改造世界观，先要抓住活思想。当时，我们大队干部中突出的思想问题是不容易接受社员的批评。我自己也是这样。在社会主义教育运动中，群众以对革命高度负责的精神，批评了我的一些错误思想和行为，我就感到受了委屈，丢了面子。我想来想去不合算，工作就消极了，甚至不愿再当干部。一天，我找到领导同志说：“换换班吧，当干部的滋味大家都尝尝才公平。”
    领导上问我：“为什么？”
    我回答：“辛辛苦苦干工作，落了一身臭脓疮。”
    “有疮就得治嘛！”领导同志说：“群众提意见，对干部是帮助，是爱护，是怕干部变坏了。身上没有疮，事先要防治；身上长了疮，不治就化脓。别人帮助开了刀，虽然痛一点，以后就快活了。”他又说：“学习毛主席著作要同思想对上号，你再学学‘老三篇’，看看你是啥思想。”
    我回到家里，重新学习了《为人民服务》。这次是带着问题，对比着自己的思想学，就感到毛主席讲的每句话都特别亲切，每句话都像是对我讲的。当我读到“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”时，思想更加明亮了。于是，我在大会小会上，检讨了自己的错误。老农胡得成曾批评我家有劳力，不该让小学生帮助我割自留地的麦。我当时认为，自己是军属，怎么不该帮助。这次学习后，认识到自己是干部，又有劳力，让学生帮助割麦不对。弟弟参军是本分，自己不应该以军属的名义搞特殊化。我就在群众会上主动作了检讨。群众说我变啦！我自己也感到浑身轻快。
    我一个人的思想提高了还不行，还必须使支部全体党员思想革命化。于是，我同支委和全体党员一起，反复学习了“老三篇”中的两个“极端”（对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱），“五种人”（高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人），“八个字”（毫不利己专门利人），以此为尺子，对照思想，狠斗“我”字，树立完全、彻底为人民服务的世界观。
    同时，我们还进行了两对比：先同白求恩、张思德、老愚公的高大形象比。一比，显得自己很渺小。大家说：白求恩毫不利己专门利人，张思德为人民而死重于泰山，老愚公不怕困难，敢想敢干，而我们却一心为自己，别人的意见听不进，自己的包袱不愿丢，这还算啥共产党员。再同革命先烈比，一比，显得自己的私心太重。大家说：革命先烈为人民洒热血，抛头颅，赴汤蹈火在所不惜。我们现在，群众提一点意见，就感到受委屈，想换班，这实际上是拒绝进步。这样一比，大家觉悟提高了，不少同志联想到旧社会的苦，激动地说：过去的伪保甲长压迫穷人，狠如豺狼，咱们走路不敢抬头，说话不敢高声，哪还敢向他们提意见。现在人民当家作主了，扬眉吐气了，人民有说话的权利，有监督干部的责任。咱们当干部的，可要好好听取群众的意见，好好为人民服务呵！
    经过回忆对比，同志们说：“现在看来，我们虽然组织上入了党，思想还没有完全入党；身子坐在社会主义大车上，脑子里装的还有‘私货’。今后，要用毛主席著作这个宝，下狠劲改造世界观，为革命献出自己的一切。”
