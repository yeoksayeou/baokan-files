Editor's Note: The six martyrs of the 32111 Drilling Team, Zhang Yongqing, Wang Ping, Luo Huatai, Wu Zhongqi, Wang Zuming, and Deng Muquan, sacrificed their lives in a raging fire to rescue state property.

They are indeed good soldiers of Chairman Mao and good sons of the Chinese people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, of the sufferings of the majority of the people. To die for the people is a worthy death."

The martyrs of the 32111 Drilling Team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, lived for the revolution and died for the revolution. They lived greatly and died gloriously. Although the martyrs have sacrificed themselves, their lofty image of dedicating themselves to the revolution and the people will forever live in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people and forever inspire hundreds of millions of people to advance courageously on the revolutionary road.

Revolutionaries are not afraid of death, but those who are afraid of death are not revolutionaries. In critical moments, is it the revolutionary cause first or personal survival first? This is the most severe test for every revolutionary and also the touchstone for true or false revolutionaries. The six martyrs of the 32111 Drilling Team have set a brilliant example for us of a true proletarian revolutionary who is not afraid of sacrifice and presses forward without fear.

We must all learn from the martyrs of the 32111 Drilling Team. Like them, we should regard the revolutionary cause as our first life, and for the revolution, we should fear neither fire nor water, and be willing to sacrifice our lives and bodies!

    为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天
    ——向32111英雄钻井队六位烈士学习
    编者按：三二一一一钻井队的张永庆、王平、罗华太、吴仲启、王祖明、邓木全等六位烈士，在冲天大火中，为了抢救国家财产，光荣地献出了自己的生命。
    他们不愧为毛主席的好战士，不愧为中国人民的好儿子。
    毛主席教导我们：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所”。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的三二一一一钻井队的烈士们，为革命而生，为革命而死。他们生的伟大，死的光荣。烈士们虽然牺牲了，但是，他们一心为革命，一心为人民的崇高形象，永远活在亿万人民的心里，永远激励着亿万人民在革命的道路上奋勇前进。
    革命不怕死，怕死不革命。在紧急关头，是革命利益第一，还是个人活命第一，这是对每个革命者的最严峻的考验，也是真革命或假革命的试金石。三二一一一钻井队的六位烈士，为我们树立了一个真正的无产阶级革命者不怕牺牲，一往无前的光辉榜样。
    我们都要向三二一一一钻井队的烈士们学习。像他们那样，以革命利益为第一生命，为了革命，赴汤蹈火，在所不辞，粉身碎骨，心甘情愿！
