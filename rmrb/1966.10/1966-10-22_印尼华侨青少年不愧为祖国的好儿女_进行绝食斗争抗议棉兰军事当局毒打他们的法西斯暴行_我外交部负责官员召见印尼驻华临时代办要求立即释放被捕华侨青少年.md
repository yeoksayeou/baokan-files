	Indonesian Chinese youth are truly good children of the motherland. They have conducted a hunger strike to protest the fascist atrocities of the military authorities in Medan, who beat them savagely. A responsible official from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indonesian chargé d'affaires in China to demand the immediate release of the detained Chinese youth.

	BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) — It is reported that 41 Chinese youth who were arrested and brutally beaten by the Indonesian military authorities in Medan on October 10 have been forced to conduct a hunger strike.

	Today, a responsible official from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Indonesian chargé d'affaires in China, Mr. Baren, to once again demand that the Indonesian government immediately release the Chinese youth who were illegally detained by the Medan military authorities.

	These Chinese youth were arbitrarily arrested by the Medan military authorities in the afternoon of October 10. On that day, Captain Ahda Be of the Indonesian military district in Medan led a group of people to the "shelter" for the affected Chinese — the dormitory of the Medan Chinese School — to provoke the Chinese residents there. Among them, two individuals who claimed to be "health inspectors" forcibly took humiliating photographs under the pretext of conducting a health inspection.

	The Chinese youth, in order to defend the dignity of their motherland, strongly protested. The Indonesian military personnel opened fire on the spot to suppress the protest and immediately dispatched a large number of troops to arrest 41 Chinese youth, including 11 young women. After being taken to the Medan base command, these Chinese youth were immediately beaten with rifle butts and military belts by dozens of soldiers, resulting in severe injuries. Subsequently, the Medan military authorities conducted individual interrogations and torture on these Chinese youth. The torture continued until midnight, with some of the Chinese youth sustaining severe injuries.

	One Chinese youth had a head injury, his legs were beaten with rifle butts and he could not move, his chest and abdomen were severely injured, and he fainted several times. Another Chinese youth was also beaten until he was covered in blood, had internal chest injuries, and was unconscious. After the interrogation, these Chinese youth were imprisoned. The next day, the Indonesian military personnel arbitrarily beat the 11 young women among the affected Chinese, and then severely beat the other male youth. An Indonesian lieutenant officer on the spot beat four or five Chinese youth until they were unconscious. Under the strong protest and demand of the affected Chinese, two severely injured youth were sent to the hospital for treatment.

	On October 12, the Indonesian military personnel tortured the detained Chinese youth again.

	To protest the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian military, the detained Chinese youth were forced to conduct a hunger strike for many days.

	After these Chinese youth were arbitrarily arrested, their parents and representatives of the affected Chinese in the Medan Chinese School "shelter" had repeatedly protested strongly to the Medan military authorities and demanded the immediate release of these Chinese youth, but their demands were arbitrarily rejected by the Medan military authorities.

	As early as October 15, a responsible official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had strongly protested to the Indonesian chargé d'affaires in China, Mr. Baren, regarding this matter. Subsequently, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally submitted a note to the Indonesian embassy in China on October 18, expressing strong protest and demanding that the Indonesian government immediately release the victims, punish the perpetrators, apologize to the victims, take responsibility for the treatment of the injured Chinese, and immediately take measures to ensure the safety of the Chinese and prevent similar incidents from happening again. Today, when the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs official summoned Baren, he reiterated these legitimate and reasonable demands.

    印尼华侨青少年不愧为祖国的好儿女
    进行绝食斗争抗议棉兰军事当局毒打他们的法西斯暴行
    我外交部负责官员召见印尼驻华临时代办要求立即释放被捕华侨青少年
    新华社二十一日讯　据悉，十月十日遭到印度尼西亚棉兰军事当局逮捕和残酷殴打的四十一名华侨青少年，被迫进行了绝食斗争。
    我外交部负责官员今天上午召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦的时候，再次要求印度尼西亚政府必须立即释放被棉兰军事当局非法拘留的这些华侨青少年。
    这些华侨青少年是十月十日下午被棉兰军事当局无理逮捕的。当天，印尼棉兰军支区阿赫达·贝上尉率领一批人来到受害华侨的“收容所”——棉兰华侨中学宿舍，向住在那里的受害华侨进行挑衅。其中有两名自称为“卫生检查员”的人，借所谓检查卫生为名强行进行侮辱性的拍照。
    华侨青少年为了维护祖国尊严，向他们提出了强烈抗议。印度尼西亚军人竟当场开枪进行镇压，并随即出动大批军队，逮捕了四十一名华侨青少年，其中有十一名是女青年。这些华侨青少年被押到棉兰基地司令部后，立即被数十名军人用枪托、军用腰带打得头破血流，遍体鳞伤。接着，棉兰军事当局又对这些华侨青少年进行个别审问和严刑拷打。严刑拷打一直继续到深夜十二时，有的华侨青少年受伤极重。
    有一名华侨青年头部受伤，双腿被枪托打得不能动弹，胸、腹部受重伤，多次昏迷；另一名华侨青年也被打得头破血流，胸部内伤，人事不省。审问后，这些华侨青少年就被关押起来。第二天，印度尼西亚军人又无理殴打了受害华侨中的十一名女青年，接着又猛烈殴打其他的男青年，有一名印度尼西亚中尉军官当场把四五名华侨青年打得处于昏迷状态。在受害华侨的强烈抗议和要求下，有两名受重伤的青年被送往医院救治。
    十二日，印度尼西亚军人又对被捕的华侨青少年进行了拷打。
    为了抗议印度尼西亚军方的法西斯暴行，被捕的华侨青少年被迫进行了多日的绝食斗争。
    这批华侨青少年被无理逮捕后，他们的家长和棉兰华侨中学“收容所”的受害华侨的代表，曾多次向棉兰军事当局提出强烈抗议，并要求立即释放这些华侨青少年，但遭到了棉兰军事当局的无理拒绝。
    中国外交部负责官员早在十月十五日便就此事向印尼驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦提出强烈抗议，随后中国外交部又于十月十八日正式向印尼驻华大使馆提交照会，表示强烈抗议，要求印度尼西亚政府立即释放这些受害者，惩办肇事人，向受害者道歉，负责治疗受伤华侨，并立即采取措施保障华侨的安全和保证不再发生类似事件。中国外交部负责官员今天上午召见巴伦时，再次重申了这些正当合理的要求。
