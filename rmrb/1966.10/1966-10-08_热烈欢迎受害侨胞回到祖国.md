The first batch of overseas Chinese who were subjected to savage persecution by the reactionaries in Indonesia and have voluntarily returned to the motherland will soon arrive. They have endured countless hardships and overcome numerous obstacles to return to the embrace of the motherland. We, the people of the entire nation, extend to them our warmest welcome and heartfelt greetings.

Over the past year, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have carried out horrifying and inhuman persecution against our overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Many of our compatriots have been massacred, and the homes and properties of many others have been burned and looted. Currently, the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, in order to curry favor with their American imperialist masters, are launching an even larger-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate campaign. We strongly condemn and protest against the atrocities committed by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia.

In the struggle against the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate policies of the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, the patriotic overseas Chinese have fearlessly resisted, bravely stood their ground, and remained united and resolute. They have not been intimidated by whips, fire, or beheadings, nor have they been tempted by bribes. They have upheld the dignity of the motherland and maintained the national spirit. They have dared to confront the fully armed Indonesian reactionaries and have dared to drive away American spies. Their resolute struggle has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and has dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. They are truly outstanding overseas Chinese of our great socialist motherland and worthy sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation.

What force has inspired them to fight so bravely and unyieldingly? It is because they have been inspired by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, because they have the great socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao as their backbone, and because they have the seven hundred million people as their strong support.

The Chinese government, adhering to the consistent policy of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, has dispatched ships to Indonesia to transport the injured overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the motherland. This fully reflects the meticulous care of our great leader Chairman Mao for the overseas Chinese. After this batch of injured overseas Chinese returns to the motherland, we will continue to dispatch ships to transport the injured overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the motherland.

In these days, the revolutionary people of the entire nation have been closely following the just struggle of the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia and have fully supported all measures taken by the Chinese government to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of our overseas Chinese, including the dispatch of ships to transport the injured overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the motherland. These suffering overseas Chinese, upon returning to the motherland, will be warmly received, cared for, and supported by all revolutionary people of the motherland, especially the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary youth, and Red Guards. This will greatly encourage the broad masses of overseas Chinese who are resolutely opposing the persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries and will be a powerful blow to American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries.

After returning to the motherland, the injured overseas Chinese will be properly settled under the care of the Party and the government. From now on, they will live, work, and struggle together with the people of the motherland forever.

The returning overseas Chinese love our great leader Chairman Mao and the socialist motherland. It is precisely because they have adhered to the patriotic stance guided by Mao Zedong Thought that they have been persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries. We believe that they will, together with the revolutionary people of the entire nation, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promote their own ideological revolution, and make contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland with their hardworking hands.

    热烈欢迎受害侨胞回到祖国
    在印度尼西亚受到反动派野蛮迫害、自愿回国的第一批华侨，就要到达祖国了。他们是历尽千辛万苦，冲破重重困难，回到祖国怀抱的。我们全国人民，向他们表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的慰问。
    一年多来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力，对于我国在印度尼西亚的侨胞，实行了骇人听闻、惨无人道的迫害。不少侨胞被屠杀，许多侨胞的房屋财产被烧光抢光。目前，印度尼西亚右派反动势力，为了向他们的主子美帝国主义卖乖讨赏，还在变本加厉地掀起更大规模的反华排华浪潮。我们对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的暴行，表示极大的愤慨和强烈的抗议。
    在反对印度尼西亚右派反动势力反华排华的斗争中，爱国华侨不畏强暴，英勇不屈，紧密团结，正气凛然。他们不怕鞭抽，不怕火烧，不怕砍头，不为利诱，维护了祖国尊严，坚持了民族气节。他们敢于同全副武装的印度尼西亚反动派进行面对面的斗争，敢于怒逐美国特务。他们的坚决斗争，大长革命人民的志气，大扫美帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派的威风。他们不愧为伟大社会主义祖国的好侨胞，不愧为伟大中华民族的好儿女。
    是什么力量鼓舞着他们进行英勇不屈的斗争？是因为他们受到战无不胜的毛泽东思想的感召，是因为有毛主席领导下的伟大的社会主义祖国作他们的靠山，是因为有七亿人民作他们的坚强后盾。
    我国政府本着一贯保护华侨正当权益的方针，派船到印度尼西亚接运自愿回国的受害侨胞，这充分体现了我们的伟大领袖毛主席对侨胞无微不至的关怀。在这一批受害侨胞返回祖国之后，我们还将继续派船接运自愿回国的受害华侨。
    在这些日子里，我国广大革命人民一直密切关怀着在印度尼西亚的爱国侨胞所进行的正义斗争，充分支持我国政府为维护我国华侨正当权益所采取的一切措施，包括派船接运自愿回国的侨胞在内。这些受难侨胞回到祖国，必将受到祖国一切革命人民，首先是广大的工农兵群众、革命青少年和红卫兵的热情的接待、照顾和支持。这对于坚决反对印度尼西亚反动派迫害的广大侨胞是巨大的鼓舞，对于美帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派是有力的打击。
    受难华侨回国后，将在党和政府的关怀下，受到妥善的安置。从此，他们将同祖国人民永远生活在一起，劳动在一起，斗争在一起。
    回国的难侨是热爱伟大领袖毛主席、热爱社会主义祖国的。他们正是因为坚持以毛泽东思想为指导的爱国主义立场而受到印度尼西亚反动派的迫害的。我们相信，他们一定会同全国革命人民一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，促进自己思想的革命化，并且以自己勤劳的双手，对祖国社会主义建设作出贡献。
