Newspaper reports from Singapore: The *Frontline News* published an article on October 1st, severely condemning the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries for their shameless curses and slander against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards, who are the vanguard of this great revolution.

The article states: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is a "great revolution."

The article points out that this great revolution "not only delivers a crushing blow to the ghosts and monsters within China but also strikes a heavy blow to all the big and small ghosts and monsters in the world."

The article says, the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries in various countries have long harbored hopes of restoring capitalism in China, pinning their hopes on the second and third generations in China. In this great revolution, Chinese youth have become the vanguards of the cultural revolution, becoming the sworn enemies and destroyers of capitalism and revisionism. "How can this not cause the imperialists and big and small ghosts and monsters to be in a state of panic, weep bitterly, gnash their teeth, and be filled with despair?"

The article also says, the Red Guards, who are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are the "most beloved sons and daughters of the people." The article calls on the people of the world to support the Chinese people's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards.

    新加坡《阵线报》盛赞中国文化大革命
    红卫兵使世界上一切牛鬼蛇神发抖
    新华社六日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡《阵线报》一日发表评论，严正谴责帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对中国无产阶级文化大革命和在这个大革命中的急先锋红卫兵的无耻咒骂和诬蔑。
    评论说：中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场“伟大的革命”。
    评论指出，这场大革命，“不仅给予中国国内的牛鬼蛇神歼灭性的打击，而且也无比沉重地打击了世界上的一切大小牛鬼蛇神。”
    评论说，美帝国主义和各国反动派长期以来都把在中国复辟资本主义的希望，寄托在中国的第二、第三代身上。在这场大革命中，中国青少年成了文化大革命的闯将，成为资本主义、修正主义不共戴天的死敌和消灭者，“这怎不叫帝国主义和大小牛鬼蛇神惊惶万状，痛哭流涕，咬牙切齿，悲观绝望呢？”
