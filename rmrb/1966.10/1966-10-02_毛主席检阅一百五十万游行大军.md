In the midst of the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we enthusiastically celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

Chairman Mao reviews a million and a half marching masses.

Comrade Lin Biao delivers an important speech at the celebration rally. He said, all our achievements and victories have been attained under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. They are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We must further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country, transforming the entire nation into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and building our great motherland to be even more prosperous and flourishing. We will continue to uphold the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the banner of proletarian internationalism, and together with the revolutionary peoples of all countries, we will carry on the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs to the end, and the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU to the end. Over three thousand representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, ethnic minorities, and Red Guards ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum to observe the ceremony. The representatives spoke, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life. Guests from more than 50 countries and regions in five continents participated in our national day celebrations. International friends spoke, praising the boundless power of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: In the unprecedented high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and amidst a very good revolutionary situation both at home and abroad, our great capital and revolutionary masses from all over the country numbering one and a half million held an unprecedented grand rally and parade in Beijing's Tiananmen Square to celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other central leaders, attended the celebration rally and reviewed the marching masses. For over six hours from morning to afternoon, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao were full of energy and vigor, always with the people. When the rally and parade ended, Chairman Mao walked down from the Tiananmen Rostrum, crossed the Golden Water Bridge, and went straight into the crowd, warmly congratulating everyone on the festival. People raised high the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, cheering and jumping, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Many people, while cheering and jumping, excitedly said: "We are so happy! Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao are in very good health and full of energy, which is the happiness of all the people of China and the people of the whole world!"

When the red sun rose, Tiananmen Square and the wide avenue to the east of the square were already filled with tens of miles of crowds. People faced the morning sun, reading Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing songs dedicated to Chairman Mao: "The red sun rises in front of us, its brilliant light illuminates the earth. Our great leader, beloved Chairman Mao, you are always with us."

The most joyful moment finally arrived! The square was filled with cheers, and the military band played "The East Is Red." Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the main leaders of the Party and the state, Liu Shaoqi, Song Qingling, Dong Biwu, Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Ulanfu, Li Xuefeng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, and others, ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum.

At this time, in the ranks of the Red Guards and Young Pioneers, red balloons with huge banners attached to them rose towards the red sun. To the south of the square, more than ten thousand people formed five huge characters with flower balls: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Countless hands waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and a sea of red light flashed. The 400,000-square-meter Tiananmen Square and the wide avenue to the east of the square became a surging sea of red. Cheers and slogans, like rolling thunder, echoed endlessly, shaking the heavens and the earth.

At this time, many people recorded this most joyful moment on the cover of their "Quotations from Chairman Mao": October 1, 1966, at 10:00 AM.

Over three thousand representatives from all over the country, including workers, peasants, soldiers, ethnic minorities, and Red Guards, brought their heroic achievements from various fronts, with hearts full of joy, ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum in batches, standing by Chairman Mao's side to participate in the national day celebration. These heroes and Red Guards excitedly said: Chairman Mao's reception of us on the Tiananmen Rostrum is the greatest care and encouragement for us. We must plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought even deeper, and forever and ever make revolution, generation after generation without changing our hearts.

Guests from more than 70 countries and regions in five continents who came to participate in our national day celebrations brought the friendship of anti-imperialist revolutionary fighters and peoples from all over the world to the Chinese people. Many foreign friends today held "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands, speaking different languages, and cheered with our revolutionary masses, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

At 10:05 AM, Beijing Acting Mayor Wu De announced the beginning of the celebration rally. At this time, the military band played the national anthem. Twenty-eight cannon shots were fired. In the center of Tiananmen Square, in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, tens of thousands of revolutionary masses formed a huge national emblem with flower balls, with giant character signs on both sides marking the historical process: 1949-1966.

Comrade Lin Biao spoke amidst thunderous applause. He, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the Government of the People's Republic of China, extended the warmest greetings to all the workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary Red Guards and other fighting youth organizations, revolutionary peoples of all nationalities, and revolutionary cadres throughout the country! He expressed heartfelt welcome to friends from all over the world!

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is a time of great changes in our country and in the world. He said, the Chinese people have completely changed their past appearance in just 17 short years. This is the great achievement of the Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Comrade Lin Biao talked about the great significance and victorious situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. He said: "This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a brand-new, creative revolution carried out after the proletariat seized political power." The purpose of this revolution is "to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and develop the socialist system." He said: "The historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship tells us that if we do not do this, revisionist rule will emerge, and capitalist restoration will occur."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Now, hundreds of millions of people have been mobilized. Revolutionary people are proud and confident, while the reactionary bourgeoisie is disgraced. We are advancing. We have laid the foundation for a great victory."

When talking about the great achievements of our national economy, Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our great motherland has never been so prosperous and lively. Our national defense has never been so strong."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The current world situation is very good. In recent years, the great upheavals in the world have shown that the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries will not live long." He emphasized: "American imperialism is trying to find a way out through a world war. We must take this seriously. The current focus of the struggle is in Vietnam. We have made all the preparations. We are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to support our Vietnamese brothers in their war of resistance against American aggression to the end. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered on the leadership of the CPSU are colluding, actively engaging in deception and talks, aiming to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national revolutionary war, extinguish the flames of national revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and extinguish the flames of world revolution. As long as the people of the world open their eyes, their plots will not succeed."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The Chinese people will continue to uphold the banner of Marxism-Leninism and the banner of proletarian internationalism, and together with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of all countries, we will carry on the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs to the end, and the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU to the end!"

Comrade Lin Biao finally said: "All our achievements and victories have been attained under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. They are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the entire country. We must definitely uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the country. We must transform the entire nation into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must build our great motherland to be even more prosperous and flourishing. This is the need of our people and also the hope of the peoples of all countries in the world for us."

During Comrade Lin Biao's speech, the one and a half million revolutionary masses applauded and cheered repeatedly, shouting revolutionary slogans, firmly responding to the call to battle issued by Comrade Lin Biao on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the people of the entire country.

Heroic workers of the 32111 drilling team, Wang Youfa, national agricultural labor model Chen Yongkang, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, Guo Xiaosi, deputy director of the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University, Nie Mengmin, and Tibetan serf liberation fighter Basang, respectively representing workers, peasants, the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary teachers and students, and ethnic minorities, successively walked to Chairman Mao's side and delivered speeches at the rally. They said:

We must print Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions. We must make reading Chairman Mao's books our first need in life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into our soul, make executing Chairman Mao's instructions an automatic action, and put revolutionary interests as our first life.

We must definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, like the PLA, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and turn all people's communes into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

We remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always maintaining a high degree of combat readiness, ready to fight at any time to liberate Taiwan! To defend our motherland! To support our Vietnamese brothers! As soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately set out, and decisively, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate the daring American imperialists and their lackeys!

We must forever uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, temper ourselves in storms and waves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The cause opened by revolutionary forerunners must be built into an iron-clad fortress in our hands.

Chairman Mao is the great savior of our various ethnic laboring people, the red sun in our hearts! We, the peoples of various ethnic minorities, must closely unite around Chairman Mao, strengthen national unity, consolidate national unity, defend our national borders, and strive to build a prosperous and strong socialist motherland!

Their speeches expressed the common revolutionary will of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses of all ethnic minorities across the country, stirring up wave after wave of thunderous applause in the square.

Vietnamese female warrior Xie Shijiao from the South, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists) E.F. Hill, Angolan National Liberation Movement fighter Dakru, Vice-Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association Hei Tiannian, and famous American black leader Robert Williams, followed by delivering speeches full of revolutionary friendship to the Chinese people at the celebration rally, which were warmly welcomed by hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the square. In their speeches, they enthusiastically praised the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought, praised the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the great achievements made in various fields, and at the same time expressed the firm determination of the revolutionary peoples of various countries to carry on the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism to the end.

At 11:15 AM, amidst the music of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the mass parade began. One and a half million revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups and sectors, each holding "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing revolutionary songs, and shouting revolutionary slogans, marched through Tiananmen Square in high spirits, accepting the review of the great leader Chairman Mao. The solemn and majestic Tiananmen Rostrum had a huge portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the center. To the east and west of the square, in front of the tall pines and cypresses, were portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In front of the Monument to the People's Heroes to the south of the square, there was a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The red stars at the top of the tall banner towers on both sides of the reviewing stand symbolized the light of Mao Zedong Thought shining in all directions.

Leading the entire parade was a giant statue of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's statue, dressed in military uniform, with one giant hand pointing forward and upward, guiding us to victory.

The vanguard of the parade, composed of more than twenty thousand People's Liberation Army soldiers, militiamen, and Red Guards, marched at the very front of the parade. The PLA soldiers guarding the national flag and emblem were valiant and heroic, carrying submachine guns, each holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marching in unison, and rhythmically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party!" The People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. Following the PLA were the militiamen and Red Guards, who are the strong backbone of the PLA. The armed militiamen, always remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on "establishing militia divisions," marched into Tiananmen Square with their heads held high, accepting the review of the great leader Chairman Mao. The Red Guard youngsters, who acted as the vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carried a giant oil painting of "Chairman Mao and the Red Guards together," and were particularly excited. The Tiananmen above and below, the cheers of the people's iron flow were invincible. People said, if the American imperialists and their lackeys dared to impose a war on the Chinese people, they would surely be buried in the vast sea of people's war.

The parade, composed of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital and the capital, formed 140 columns, stretching for dozens of miles, merging into a great revolutionary torrent, advancing majestically. When the workers and peasants' columns arrived in front of Tiananmen, everyone cheered for the good situation on the industrial and agricultural fronts across the country, and warmly applauded and paid tribute to the worker and peasant masses who had made great contributions to the socialist revolution and construction!

The columns of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country were the largest cultural revolutionary army in today's capital's national day parade. They marched hand in hand with the workers, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in the capital. In this column, there were daughters of liberated serfs from the Tibetan Plateau, red youths from Chairman Mao's hometown, and also revolutionary descendants from revolutionary holy places such as Yan'an, Jinggangshan, and Zunyi. They, on behalf of hundreds of millions of revolutionary youths across the country, came to accept the review of the great leader Chairman Mao, expressing their firm will to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

After the entire parade passed through Tiananmen Square, the tens of thousands of Young Pioneers, Red Guards, and revolutionary teachers and students, as well as workers and cadres, gathered in the south of the square, joyfully surged towards Tiananmen. They waved flower balls, wreaths, and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically cheering for Chairman Mao. Fireworks were set off in the square, and countless red balloons soared into the sky. At this time, on the 16 reviewing stands by the Golden Water Bridge, international friends from more than 70 countries and regions, representatives of workers, peasants, and various ethnic minorities across the country, overseas Chinese returning to visit, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other leaders of the Party and the state, frequently waved to the cheering crowds. The festive atmosphere on Tiananmen and below reached its peak, fully demonstrating the great unity of the Chinese people and the great unity of the people of the world.

    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中热烈庆祝建国十七周年
    毛主席检阅一百五十万游行大军
    林彪同志在庆祝大会上发表重要讲话。他说，我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们要进一步在全国开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，把全国变成为毛泽东思想的大学校，把伟大的祖国建设得更加强盛，更加兴旺。我们将继续高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，高举无产阶级国际主义旗帜，同各国革命人民一起，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。三千多工农兵、少数民族和红卫兵代表登上天安门城楼观礼。代表们讲话祝毛主席万寿无疆五大洲七十多个国家和地区来宾参加我国国庆。国际朋友讲话赞颂伟大毛泽东思想威力无穷
    新华社一日讯　在史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，在国内外一片大好的革命形势下，我们伟大祖国首都和来自全国各地的一百五十万革命群众，今天在北京天安门广场举行了空前盛大的集会游行，庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年。
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，参加了庆祝大会，检阅了游行大军。从上午持续到下午的六个多小时中，毛主席和林彪同志精力充沛，神采焕发，一直和大家在一起。集会游行结束时，毛主席又走下天安门城楼，走过金水桥，一直走到群众队伍之中，亲切地向大家祝贺节日。人们高高举起手中红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，欢呼着，跳跃着，千遍万遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”许多人一面欢呼跳跃，一面激动地说：“我们太幸福了！毛主席和林彪同志非常健康，精力非常旺盛，这是全中国人民和全世界人民的幸福！”
    当一轮红日喷薄而出的时候，天安门广场和广场东侧的宽阔大道上，早已汇集了数十里长的群众队伍。人们迎着朝霞，朗读毛主席语录，高唱献给毛主席的颂歌：“红日在我们面前升起，灿烂的光辉照红了大地。伟大的领袖，敬爱的毛主席，您永远和我们在一起。”
    最幸福的时刻终于来到了！广场上万众欢腾，军乐队奏起《东方红》，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及党和国家的主要负责人刘少奇、宋庆龄、董必武、周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、邓小平、康生、朱德、李富春、陈云、陈毅、刘伯承、贺龙、李先念、谭震林、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英、乌兰夫、李雪峰、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、江青等，登上了天安门城楼。
    这时，广场上红卫兵和少年先锋队的队伍里，系着巨幅标语的红气球，迎着红太阳冉冉升起。广场南面，十多万人用花球组成了五个大字：“毛主席万岁”！千千万万只手挥动着《毛主席语录》，一片红光闪耀。四十万平方米的天安门广场和广场东侧的宽阔大道上，群众队伍成了红浪澎湃的海洋。欢呼声、口号声，好像阵阵春雷，滚滚不息，震天动地。
    这时，很多人在《毛主席语录》扉页上记下了这个最幸福的时刻：一九六六年十月一日上午十时整。
    有三千多名来自全国各地的工农兵代表、少数民族代表和红卫兵代表，带着他们在各条战线上创造出来的英雄业绩，怀着万分喜悦的心情，分批登上天安门城楼，站在毛主席身旁参加节日庆典。这些英雄人物和红卫兵们激动地说：毛主席在天安门城楼上接见我们，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞。我们一定更深更深地扎下毛泽东思想的根子，永远永远干革命，世世代代不变心。
    从世界五大洲七十多个国家和地区前来参加我国国庆的各国朋友们，给中国人民带来了全世界反帝革命战士和各国人民的友谊。许许多多外国友人，今天手持《毛主席语录》，操着不同的语言，同我国革命群众一起欢呼毛主席万寿无疆。
    上午十时零五分，北京市代理市长吴德同志宣布庆祝大会开始。这时，军乐队奏国歌。礼炮齐鸣二十八响。在天安门广场的中心，在人民英雄纪念碑的前面，十几万革命群众用花球组成了巨大的国徽，两旁是标志着历史进程的巨大字标：1949——1966。
    林彪同志在全场暴风雨般的掌声中讲话。他代表我们的伟大领袖毛主席，代表党中央和中华人民共和国政府，向全国的工农兵、革命师生、革命红卫兵和其他战斗的青少年组织、各民族革命人民和革命干部，致最热烈的敬礼！向来自世界各国的朋友们表示衷心的欢迎！
    林彪同志指出，中华人民共和国成立的十七周年，在我国是翻天覆地的十七年，在世界也是翻天覆地的十七年。他说，中国人民在短短的十七年间，完全改变了过去的面貌。这是毛泽东同志领导的中国人民群众的丰功伟绩。
    林彪同志谈到了我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和胜利形势。他说：“这场无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级夺取政权以后进行的一种崭新的创造性的大革命。”这场大革命的目的“是为着进一步巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义制度。”他说：“国际无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，如果我们不这样做，就会出现修正主义的统治，就会发生资本主义的复辟。”
    林彪同志说：“现在，亿万人民群众发动起来了。革命人民扬眉吐气，反动资产阶级威风扫地。我们正在前进。我们已经奠定了伟大胜利的局面。”
    林彪同志在谈到我国国民经济的巨大成就时说：“我们伟大的祖国，从来没有这样繁荣，这样生动活泼。我们的国防从来没有这样强大。”
    林彪同志说：“当前的世界是一片大好形势。几年来世界的大动荡表明，以美国为首的帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派，他们的寿命不长了。”他强调指出：“美帝国主义力图从发动一场世界战争中寻找出路。我们必须加以认真对待。当前斗争的焦点在越南。我们已经作好了一切准备。我们决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持兄弟的越南人民把抗美救国的战争进行到底。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，正在狼狈为奸，积极搞和谈欺骗的勾当，目的是要扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火，扑灭亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族革命斗争的烈火，扑灭世界革命的烈火。只要全世界人民擦亮眼睛，他们的阴谋是不能得逞的。”
    林彪同志说：“中国人民将继续高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，同全世界马克思列宁主义者一起，同各国革命人民一起，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底，把反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！”
    林彪同志最后说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我们要用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全国人民群众的思想。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步在全国开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。我们要把全国变成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校。我们要把伟大的祖国建设得更加强盛，更加兴旺。这是我国人民的需要，也是世界各国人民对我们的希望。”
    在林彪同志讲话的过程中，一百五十万革命群众一次又一次地鼓掌欢呼，高喊革命口号，表示坚决响应林彪同志代表毛主席和党中央向全国人民发出的战斗号召。
    英雄的32111钻井队工人王有发，全国农业劳动模范陈永康，中国人民解放军北京部队某部副连长郭小四，北京大学文化革命委员会副主任聂孟民和西藏翻身农奴巴桑，分别代表全国工人、农民、人民解放军、革命师生和少数民族，相继走到毛主席身边，在大会上发表讲话。他们说：
    我们要把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。把读毛主席的书，作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命。
    我们一定要响应林彪同志的号召，像解放军那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照着毛主席的指示办事，把所有的农村人民公社办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我们牢记毛主席的教导，时刻保持着高度的战斗准备，随时准备为解放台湾而战！为保卫祖国而战！为支援兄弟的越南人民而战！只要毛主席一声令下，我们就立即出动，把敢于侵犯我们的美帝国主义和它的帮凶，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地消灭掉！
    我们要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在大风大浪中把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。革命先辈开创的基业，要在我们手里建成铁打的江山。
    毛主席是我们各族劳动人民的大救星，是我们心中的红太阳！我们各民族人民要紧紧团结在毛主席的周围，加强民族团结，巩固祖国统一，保卫祖国边疆，为建设繁荣富强的社会主义祖国而奋斗！
    他们的讲话，表达了全国亿万工农兵和各民族革命群众共同的革命意志，在广场上激起一阵又一阵雷鸣般的掌声。
    越南南方女战斗英雄谢氏娇，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席爱·弗·希尔，安哥拉民族解放运动战士达克鲁斯，日中友协副会长黑田寿男和著名的美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，接着在庆祝大会上发表对中国人民充满革命友谊的讲话，受到了全场百数十万革命群众的热烈欢迎。他们在讲话中热情地赞颂了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无穷威力，赞颂了我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义和我国在各条战线上所取得的巨大成就，同时表达了各国革命人民要把反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底的坚强决心。
    上午十一时十五分，在《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲声中，群众游行开始。一百五十万各族各界革命群众，人人挥动《毛主席语录》，高唱革命歌曲，高呼革命口号，意气风发地通过天安门广场，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。庄严雄伟的天安门城楼红墙中央，高挂着毛主席的巨幅画像。广场东西两侧的苍松翠柏前，竖着马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的画像。广场南面人民英雄纪念碑前，竖着孙中山的画像。观礼台左右高大标语塔顶端的红星，象征毛泽东思想光芒照四方。
    引导整个游行队伍的，是毛主席的巨大塑像。毛主席塑像身着军装，一只巨手伸向前上方，指引着我们胜利前进的方向。
    由两万多名人民解放军、民兵和红卫兵组成的前卫队，英姿勃勃，威风凛凛，走在群众游行队伍的最前面。护卫着国旗和国徽的人民解放军健儿，雄赳赳，气昂昂，挎着冲锋枪，个个高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，踏着整齐的步伐，有节奏地不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！”由毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。紧跟着解放军的，是作为解放军强大后盾的民兵和红卫兵。武装的民兵们念念不忘毛主席关于“大办民兵师”的谆谆教导，昂首阔步进入天安门广场，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。在无产阶级文化大革命中充当急先锋的红卫兵小将们，抬着“毛主席和红卫兵在一起”的巨幅油画，格外兴高采烈。天安门上下，万众欢呼人民的铁流无坚不摧。人们说，美帝国主义及其帮凶，胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，定叫它葬身在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    由工人、农民、革命知识分子、革命干部、外地和首都革命师生组成的游行大军，分成一百四十路纵队，连绵数十里，汇成一支伟大的革命洪流，浩浩荡荡地前进。当工人、农民队伍来到天安门前，人们都为全国工农业战线传来的大好形势而欢呼，向在社会主义革命和建设事业中作出巨大贡献的工农群众热烈鼓掌致敬！
    来自全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生的队伍，是今天首都国庆游行中一支人数最多的文化革命大军。他们和首都的工人、革命师生、革命干部携手并肩前进。在这支队伍中，有来自西藏高原的翻身农奴子女，有来自毛主席故乡的红色青少年，也有来自革命圣地延安、井冈山、遵义等地的革命后代。他们受全国亿万革命青少年的委托，来接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅，向毛主席表达他们誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强意志。
    全部游行队伍通过天安门广场以后，聚集在广场南部的少先队员、红卫兵和革命师生，以及工人、干部等十多万人，欢欣雀跃地涌向天安门。他们挥舞花球、花环和《毛主席语录》，尽情地向毛主席欢呼，广场上礼花齐放，无数红色气球腾空而起。这时，金水桥畔十六个观礼台上来自世界七十多个国家和地区的国际友人，全国工农兵和各兄弟民族的代表，回国观光华侨和港澳同胞，同声高呼“毛主席万岁！”毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及党和国家的其他领导人，频频向欢呼的人们招手致意。天安门上下的欢腾气氛达到高峰，充分显示了中国人民大团结和全世界人民大团结。
    今天，登上天安门城楼观礼的，有来自五大洲的反帝革命著名战士和其他国际友人。他们当中有：索马里国民议会友好代表团团长、国民议会议长谢赫·穆克塔尔·穆罕默德·侯赛因，巴基斯坦友好代表团团长阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗，坦桑尼亚友好代表团团长基顿杜，锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记纳·桑穆加塔桑，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳，印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局委员阿吉托罗普，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和夫人，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多和夫人，柬中友协代表团团长兰·涅特，刚果（布）政府经济代表团团长达·科斯塔·克劳德·安托万，苏丹和平人士凯尔，刚果（布）全国革命运动政治局委员奥贝·伦达，阿尔巴尼亚石油代表团团长泽内尔·哈米蒂等。
