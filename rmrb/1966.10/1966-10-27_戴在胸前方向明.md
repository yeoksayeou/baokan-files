Dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army whom I have not had the chance to meet:

I was deeply moved after reading your letter expressing your feelings. I have made up my mind to definitely send you the Chairman Mao badges that you have been longing for day and night. This is my duty and obligation.

Currently, obtaining Chairman Mao badges in Beijing is not easy. Many students coming to Beijing for revolutionary linking up want them, and some even want to take several back to give to their revolutionary comrades. I managed to get ten Chairman Mao badges with great difficulty and am now mailing them to you.

These ten shining Chairman Mao badges, once they reach you, will be cherished more than anything else. You will wear them on your chests without a moment's separation. Although you are guarding the southwestern gate of our motherland and cannot see Chairman Mao himself, with the Chairman Mao badges on your chests and shining in your hearts, it will feel as if he is right by your side, filling you with strength.

Although we do not know each other, our revolutionary hearts are closely connected. Let us together hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, brave the storms and waves of class struggle, and forge ahead courageously!

Your comrade-in-arms—
A Red Guard from Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Middle School

    戴在胸前方向明没见过面的解放军同志们：
    看了表达你们心情的信，非常激动。我下定决心，一定要为你们寄去你们日夜思念的毛主席像纪念章。这是我的责任和义务。
    目前在北京要得到毛主席像纪念章不容易。因为大批到北京进行革命串连的同学都想要，有的人还想多带几枚回去赠给革命的战友。我好不容易得到了十枚毛主席像纪念章，现在给你们邮去。
  这十枚金光闪闪的纪念章寄到你们那里以后，你们一定会比什么都爱惜它，一刻也不离地佩戴在你们的胸前。你们守卫在祖国的西南大门，虽然看不见毛主席他老人家，有了毛主席像纪念章，戴在胸前，亮在心上，就会觉得他老人家就在你们的身边，浑身充满了力量。
    虽然咱们互不相识，但我们的革命红心是紧紧联系在一起的。让咱们共同高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，乘风破浪，奋勇前进吧！
    你们的战友——北京钢铁学院附中的一个红卫兵
            十月十六日
