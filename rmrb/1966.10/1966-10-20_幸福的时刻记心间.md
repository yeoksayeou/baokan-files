The 18th, Chairman Mao received the Red Guards and revolutionary students for the fourth time. A large number of readers' letters and manuscripts have been pouring into the editorial department, each word and sentence overflowing with the joy of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao. Here are some excerpts from the letters.

	The 18th of October, we saw Chairman Mao, fulfilling a long-cherished wish. This day will be forever etched in our memories.

	We clearly remember that six years ago, when the reactionary forces in Indonesia were madly anti-China, it was Chairman Mao who brought us, these suffering children, back to our motherland. We clearly see that this year, when the reactionary forces in Indonesia are once again madly anti-China, it was Chairman Mao who sent the "Guanghua" ship to bring back our suffering fathers and brothers. "The party's love is greater than the heavens and the earth, father and mother's love is not as great as Chairman Mao's love..." This song truly expresses the feelings of overseas Chinese.

	I am a Red Guard from the front lines of Fujian. The waves of the East China Sea and the booming sound of cannons echo in my ears; the suffering of the Taiwanese people and the moans of two-thirds of the oppressed people in the world resonate in my chest!

	Respected Chairman Mao, your inspection of our ranks is the greatest concern and care for us. I will surely remember your teachings: to care about national affairs, to keep an eye on world events, to learn from the People's Liberation Army, and to be a reliable reserve force for the People's Liberation Army.

	I came from the southern gate of the motherland, Hainan Island, to the capital, and saw our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, whom we have been thinking of day and night.

	We often drive our fishing boats swiftly across the waters of the Beibu Gulf. We understand that in the vast sea, without a steering wheel, one will lose direction; in the revolutionary struggle, without Mao Zedong Thought, one will not see the path forward. We will surely follow you and advance bravely in the direction you point out.

	Chairman Mao, I promise you: I will read and apply your four volumes of great works every day, every month, and every year, and I will surely master Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao, we will surely hold high the torch of revolution; we will surely hold high the banner of revolution. We will not only carry out the Chinese revolution to the end but also carry out the world revolution to the end, letting the red flag fly all over the world.

		A Red Guard from Dingli Agricultural Middle School, Wujin County, Jiangsu

	At 13:20 on October 18, I saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. The time was too short, and I wished that Chairman Mao's car could slow down by my side so that I could see him more clearly!

	Chairman Mao's car has gone far, but my heart is always with Chairman Mao, forever with Chairman Mao.

		A student from Nanping Revolutionary Middle School, Fujian

	Day and night, I have been longing for this happiest moment. Seeing the great leader Chairman Mao, my blood boils and tears fill my eyes. Words of affection and songs of praise, thousands and thousands, cannot express my boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader.

	Most beloved Chairman Mao! I will surely bring back the happiness of seeing you and the fighting experience of my comrades in the capital. I will surely follow your instructions and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

		A Red Guard from Shenyang

	Today, we accepted the inspection of the supreme commander, Chairman Mao. I want to swear to Chairman Mao: my father fought to establish the country, and I will fight to defend the regime. Generation after generation, we will make revolution, forever following Chairman Mao!

	My father was a Red Army soldier, and the supreme commander was Chairman Mao. My father followed Chairman Mao to make revolution, went through the Long March of 25,000 li, and later developed the Nanluwan in Shaanbei. Wherever Chairman Mao pointed, my father went, and victory came. The path my father took is the path I will take.

		A Red Guard from Yongxin County Middle School, Jiangxi

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, seeing you, many past events surge into my heart: following your teachings, I was not afraid of pain and practiced acupuncture on myself; following your teachings, I overcame difficulties and finally made an eleven-year-old congenital deaf-mute child shout "Long live Chairman Mao"! Following your teachings, I cared for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and during the seven months of participating in the socialist education movement, I treated more than 800 people...

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, your words shine with golden light, and every sentence is the truth. As long as we follow your instructions, we will trample any great difficulty underfoot and seize countless victories!

		A nurse from a certain automobile school of the PLA

	Most beloved Chairman Mao, we come from the rivers and lakes of the country, gathering by your side. We will surely listen to your words: to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers; to firmly carry out the Sixteen Points, and to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. Under your leadership, we will smash the Four Olds and establish the Four News. In a word, we will smash the old world and build a red new world!

		A student from Yunnan University

	The bright sun rose to the middle of the sky, and my emotions surged higher and higher. "He's coming, Chairman Mao is coming!" In an instant, Chairman Mao appeared among the revolutionary teachers and students. How exciting, how happy, we finally saw the great helmsman Chairman Mao. All the words in my heart condensed into a shout: "Long live Chairman Mao!" We watched Chairman Mao's departing figure and held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" tightly to our chests. Chairman Mao's repeated receptions have given us boundless strength. We will bring our happy meeting with Chairman Mao back to share with our comrades.

    幸福的时刻记心间
    十八日，毛主席第四次接见了红卫兵和革命师生。大量的读者来稿来信，不断地涌向编辑部，字字句句洋溢着见到伟大领袖毛主席的幸福心情。这里选登部分来信的摘要。　　　编　者
    △十月十八日，我们见到了毛主席，实现了多年来的愿望。这一天我们终生难忘。
    我们清楚地记得，六年前，正当印度尼西亚反动势力疯狂反华时，是毛主席把我们这些苦难的孩子接回祖国。我们清楚地看到，今年，正当印度尼西亚反动势力再次疯狂反华时，又是毛主席派“光华轮”接回了我们受难的父兄。“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲……”，这歌词真正表达了我们华侨的心情。

    △我是来自福建前线的红卫兵，东海的波涛，隆隆的炮声，在我耳边回响；台湾人民的苦难，世界上三分之二被压迫人民的呻吟，在我胸中激荡！
    敬爱的毛主席，您检阅我们的队伍，是对我们最大的重视和关怀。我一定牢记您的教导：关心国家大事，放眼世界风云，向解放军学习，做人民解放军可靠的后备军。

    △我从祖国的南大门——海南岛来到了首都，见到了我们日夜想念的伟大领袖毛主席。
    我们经常驾驶渔轮急驰在北部湾海面上。我们懂得：在茫茫大海中行驶，没有方向盘就会迷失方向；在革命斗争中，没有毛泽东思想，就看不清前进的道路。我们一定紧紧跟着您，朝着您所指引的方向奋勇前进。

    △毛主席啊，我向您保证：您的四卷雄文，我一定天天读，天天用；月月读，月月用；年年读，年年用，一定要把毛泽东思想学到手。
    毛主席啊，革命火炬，我们一定高高举起；革命大旗，我们一定高高举起。我们不但要把中国革命进行到底，还要把世界革命进行到底，让红旗在全世界飘扬。

    △十月十八日十三点二十分，我见到了最敬爱的领袖毛主席。时间太短暂了，我多么希望毛主席的车子能在我的身边开得慢点，让我看得更仔细，更清楚啊！
    毛主席的车子走远了，但是我的心一直跟着毛主席，永远跟着毛主席。

    △日想，夜盼，终于盼来了这最幸福的时刻。见到了伟大领袖毛主席，热血沸腾泪满眶。知心的话儿千言万语，赞颂的歌儿千篇万首，都难以表达我对伟大领袖的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。
    最最敬爱的毛主席呀！我一定把见到您的幸福带回去，把首都战友们的斗争经验带回去，一定按照您的指示，把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。

    爸爸当年当红军，最高司令是毛主席。爸爸跟着毛主席闹革命，经过了二万五千里长征，后来又在陕北开发南泥湾。毛主席指向那里，爸爸就奔向那里，胜利也就来到那里。爸爸走的这条道路，正是我要走的道路。
                江西永新县中学一红卫兵
    △毛主席啊，毛主席，见到了您，一件件往事涌上我的心头：听了您的教导，我不怕疼痛，在自己身上练针灸；听了您的教导，我克服困难，终于使一个十一岁的先天性聋哑病儿喊出了“毛主席万岁”！听了您的教导，我关心贫下中农，参加社会主义教育运动的七个月中间，为他们看病八百多人次……。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，您的话字字闪金光，句句是真理，只要照着您的指示办，天大的困难脚下踩，万千胜利夺得来！

    △最最敬爱的毛主席，我们来自五湖四海，汇集在您的身旁。我们一定听您的话：要以解放军为榜样，向工农兵学习；坚决按十六条办事，胜利地完成一斗、二批、三改的战斗任务。在您的领导下，我们要砸碎四旧，树立四新。一句话，砸碎旧世界，建立一个红彤彤的新世界！

    △明亮的太阳升到半空中，我的心潮越涌越高。“来了，毛主席来了！”一瞬间，毛主席来到革命师生中间。多么激动，多么幸福，我们终于见到了伟大的舵手毛主席。满腹的话儿，只凝成了一句欢呼声：“毛主席万寿无疆！”我们望着毛主席远去的身影，把《毛主席语录》紧紧贴在胸前。毛主席一次又一次的接见，给我们增添了无穷的力量，我们要把同毛主席的幸福会见，带回去同战友们分享。
