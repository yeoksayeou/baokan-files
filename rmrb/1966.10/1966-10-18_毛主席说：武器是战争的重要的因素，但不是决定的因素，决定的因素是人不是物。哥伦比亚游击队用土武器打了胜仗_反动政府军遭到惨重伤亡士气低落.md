Chairman Mao says: Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the deciding factor. The deciding factor is people, not things.

The Colombian guerrilla forces have achieved victory with makeshift weapons.

The reactionary government army suffered heavy casualties and low morale.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Bogota: In recent battles, the anti-government guerrilla forces in the El Patio region of Colombia's Huila Province have dealt heavy blows to the government army.

The guerrillas used landmines, pits, and other tactics to counter the government army, which was supported by American-made bombers. This resulted in significant casualties for the reactionary army, causing their morale to plummet. Reports indicate that at least two floors of the military hospital in Bogota are filled with government soldiers, low-ranking officers, and officers who were injured in recent battles in the El Patio region. Next to this military hospital is a helipad where helicopters from Huila Province land daily, bringing in wounded soldiers. The disheartened government army wounded soldiers recount how the guerrillas used dense forests to launch surprise attacks on them, seizing their weapons and equipment.

Desperate, the government army indiscriminately bombed the jungles. In Tolima Province, the reactionary army also confiscated fishermen's boats to prevent the guerrillas from crossing rivers. They frequently raided farmers' homes at night. These reactionary measures have sparked strong protests from local residents.

To prevent the spread of news about the government's losses, the Colombian reactionary authorities have imposed a strict blockade on the military hospital and refused to disclose details about the battles. In some provinces, news censorship has been implemented.

In the latter half of September, the Colombian anti-government guerrilla forces killed and wounded 40 government soldiers in battles.

    哥伦比亚游击队用土武器打了胜仗
    反动政府军遭到惨重伤亡士气低落
    据新华社讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚乌伊拉省埃尔帕托地区的反政府游击队，在最近的几次战斗中给了政府军以沉重打击。
    游击队用布置土地雷、陷坑等办法来对付有美国新式轰炸机配合作战的政府军，给反动军队造成大量伤亡，使他们士气低落。据报道，波哥大军医院至少有两层楼住满了最近在埃尔帕托地区的战斗中受伤的政府军士兵、低级官员和军官。在这个军医院旁边有一个直升飞机场，每天都有来自乌伊拉省的直升飞机在那里降落，运来伤兵。丧魂落魄的政府军伤员向别人讲述游击队如何利用茂密的树林，在政府军士兵很少预料到的时候袭击他们，夺走他们的武器和装备。
    政府军狗急跳墙，对丛林进行狂轰滥炸。在托利马省，反动军队还没收了渔民的船只，以防止游击队渡河。他们还常常在深夜去农民家里搜查。这些反动措施引起了当地居民的强烈抗议。
    为了不让政府军失利的消息传播开来，哥伦比亚反动当局对军医院进行了严密的封锁，并且拒绝透露关于战斗的详细情况。在有的省，还实行了新闻检查。
    九月下半月，哥伦比亚反政府游击队在同政府军进行的战斗中，打死打伤政府军四十人。
