Party small groups: How to manage cadres and promote their ideological revolutionization? The party branch of a certain team's ninth company in the construction engineering unit educates soldier party members to break through all their inhibitions, take responsibility for the revolution and the construction of the company, and boldly supervise and enthusiastically help party member cadres. It also educates party member cadres to take responsibility for the revolution, dare to correct their shortcomings and mistakes, and place themselves under the strict management of the party.

	Be Proactive in Accepting Supervision

	Last year, the party branch passed a resolution to strengthen party members' organizational awareness, requiring party members to report to the organization once a week. The first platoon's party small group has five party members, four of whom report to the group leader on time, while the platoon leader has not reported for three consecutive weeks. Group leader Sun Jingfa hesitated: if he didn't manage, the branch had a resolution; if he did, he felt he was a subordinate and couldn't bring himself to do it. The branch secretary discovered this problem and pointed out to him: "Within the party, there is no distinction between cadres and soldiers. There should be no 'special party members.' Placing cadre party members in platoons for organizational life is precisely to enable cadres to accept the supervision of party members and strengthen their party spirit. He also said: "Daring to manage or not daring to manage cadres is an important indicator of whether our party members have pure party spirit and whether they are responsible for the party's cause." After hearing the branch secretary's words, Sun Jingfa went to talk to the platoon leader, proactively checked his own thoughts of not daring to manage cadres. The platoon leader, upon hearing this, firmly shook Sun Jingfa's hand and said: "Your criticism of me is correct. The responsibility is all mine. I didn't proactively report to you because of my individualism and weak organizational awareness. If this continues, won't I become a 'special party member'?" From then on, the platoon leader reported to the group leader on time, proactively sought the opinions of party members, and took the lead in expressing his thoughts at small group meetings, actively completing the tasks assigned by the party small group.

	Criticism Hits the Nail on the Head

	Last year, the company recruited many new soldiers. Some of the new soldiers heard that the company deals with stones all day and regretted joining the engineering corps. Once, the platoon leader told everyone: "Being an engineer can learn skills, and after demobilization, you can become a technician, earning fifty or sixty yuan a month, which is also a bright future." Soldier party member Luo Pibao heard this and felt uncomfortable. After the meeting, he told the platoon leader, "Your intention in saying this is to motivate everyone's enthusiasm, but what you motivate is the enthusiasm of bourgeois individualism; the higher this enthusiasm, the greater the harm to the revolution." He suggested that the platoon leader should, in the future, conduct ideological education for the troops, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and establish the idea of taking pride in hardship and serving the people wholeheartedly. The platoon leader, upon hearing the soldier's criticism, felt that every word was correct, truly hitting the nail on the head. He made a profound self-criticism at the branch meeting.

	The Masses Have the Most Insight

	Third platoon leader Lu Yunxi used to think that his level would not be lower than that of soldier party members and had different views on soldier party members supervising cadres. At the end of last year, during a meeting to evaluate model soldiers, everyone nominated first platoon soldier Li Xican as the model soldier for the entire company, but he was not convinced, saying, "The stones are not moved by him alone," and firmly disagreed. After the meeting, the political instructor criticized him, and he had a falling out with the political instructor. The party small group specially held a meeting to help him recognize his shortcomings, but he still thought he was correct. Soldier and candidate party member Zhang Baonan then talked to him, saying: "Platoon leader, after I enlisted, I have always been under your leadership as a soldier. You educated me and nurtured me from an ordinary soldier into an honorable Communist Party member, and introduced me into the party. These I will never forget. But today's matter, I feel you are very wrong. You are quarreling over personal grudges, falling into the trap of individualism. Why don't you correct your mistakes?" The candidate party member's words made Lu Yunxi's face burn with shame. He felt how sincere his comrades' advice was and how high the soldiers' level and understanding were. He accepted the soldiers' criticism and made a self-criticism at the small group meeting. He deeply felt that no matter how deep one's experience is or how high one's position is, one cannot for a moment be without the organization's supervision and the masses' help; the masses have the most insight.

    接受群众监督不当“特殊党员”
    张培玉
    党小组怎样才能管好干部，促进干部的思想革命化？工程建筑某团九连党支部，教育战士党员打破一切顾虑，对革命、对连队建设负责，大胆地监督和热情地帮助党员干部；也教育党员干部对革命负责，勇于改正缺点错误，把自己置于党的严格管理之下。
    要主动接受监督
    去年党支部为了使党员增强组织观念，专门通过了一项决议，要求党员每周向组织作一次汇报。一排党小组有五名党员，四个能按时向小组长汇报，只有连长一连三个星期没有汇报。党小组长孙景发犯了犹豫：不管吧，支部有决议；找他吧，又感到自己是下级，张不开口。支部书记发现了这个问题，向他指出：党内没有干部、战士之分，不允许有“特殊党员”。把干部党员编到排里过组织生活，正是为了使干部接受党员的监督，增强党性锻炼。又说：“敢管不敢管干部，是衡量我们党员党性纯不纯、对党的事业负不负责任的重要标志。”孙景发听了支部书记的话，就找连长交心，主动检查了自己不敢管干部的思想。连长听了，紧紧握住了孙景发的手，说：“你对我的批评很对呀，责任全在我身上。我不主动找你汇报，是个人主义在作怪，是组织观念不强；如果发展下去，我不成了‘特殊党员’吗？”从此以后，连长按时向小组长汇报，主动征求党员意见，在小组会上带头亮思想，积极完成党小组分配的任务。
    批评到节骨眼上了
    去年，连队补充了许多新战士。新战士听说连队整天和石头打交道，有的后悔不该当工兵。有一次，连长对大家说：当工兵能学到技术，复员回家可以当个技术员，每月五、六十元钱，不也很有前途吗？战士党员罗丕宝听了这话，感到很不是味。散会后，他对连长说，你讲这话的动机，是为了调动大家的积极性，可是调动起来的是资产阶级个人主义的积极性；这种积极性越高，对革命的损害就越大。他建议连长今后对部队进行思想教育，应当以毛泽东思想为指针，树立以苦为荣、全心全意为人民的思想。连长听了战士的批评，感到句句都很对，真是批评到节骨眼上了。他在支部会上作了深刻检讨。
    群众是最有见解的
    三排长陆云喜，过去总觉得自己的水平不会比战士党员低，对战士党员监督干部有不同看法。去年底，在一次评比标兵的连务会上，大家推选一排战士李希灿为全连的标兵，唯独他心里不服气，说：“石头不是他一个人搬的”，坚决不同意。散会后，指导员批评他，他和指导员又弄僵了。党小组为这事专门开了会，帮助他认识缺点，他仍然认为自己是正确的。战士、预备党员张宝安便找他谈心，说：“排长，我参军后，一直在你的领导下当战士，你教育了我，把我从一个普通战士培养成为光荣的共产党员，介绍我入了党，这些我永远忘不了。但是今天的事情，我感到你非常不对。你是闹个人意气，陷入了个人主义圈子，你为什么知错不改呢？”预备党员的一席话，使陆云喜脸上直发烧，他感到同志的劝告是多么诚恳，战士的水平和理解力又是多么高。他接受了战士的批评，在小组会上作了检讨。他深深体会到，一个人不管资历多深，职务多高，一时一刻也不能离开组织的监督，离开群众的帮助；群众是最有见解的。
