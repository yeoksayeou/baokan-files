Edition: 6

To share our greatest joy with everyone, we are writing this letter to tell you some exciting news. Red Guards from all over the country, upon hearing that *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* are being supplied today, have gathered in front of our New China Bookstore since last night, forming a long queue. Amidst the sound of firecrackers, they sing *Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman* with all their might and shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" Early in the morning, as soon as we opened the door, many people rushed in. Thousands of pairs of eager eyes looked at us with smiles. Ah! This is because we are holding the golden, shining treasure book in our hands. The greatest work of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world, *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, is being distributed one by one into the hands of the vast readers through our hands.

"I got it! I got it!" A little Red Guard from the hometown of the great communist warrior Liu Yingjun, after receiving *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* from our hands, shouted excitedly. Then he carefully wrote on the book's flyleaf: "Revolution cannot be done without Mao Zedong Thought. Today, I bought Chairman Mao's works. In the future, I will definitely strive to study and apply them actively, and be like Uncle Liu Yingjun, a good student of Chairman Mao!"

"Why do you write on the book?" a comrade asked.

"I've been waiting and waiting! Finally, I got it. How could I not write a few words!" the little Red Guard replied.

"Uncle, I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works like Uncle Liu Yingjun," the little Red Guard declared excitedly.

Such moving scenes can be seen everywhere. Countless people sent letters from thousands of miles away. These letters come from border guards on the Sino-Indian border, from forest workers trekking through the Great Khingan Mountains, from young fishermen navigating the vast waves of the Xisha Islands, from herdsmen battling the desert sands... They express their shared desire with the most excited hearts: they urgently yearn for *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*. From the letters, it seems as if they are all calling out: Hurry! Hurry and bring Chairman Mao's books to us!

Indeed, they truly love our great leader Chairman Mao and are most loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. They eagerly await reading Chairman Mao's works. Some walk hundreds of miles to buy them, some have waited for seven years, and some, unable to buy them, impatiently borrow books to copy them word by word into notebooks, paying unknown amounts of hard work.

To let the sun shine on the earth and let the dew nourish people's hearts, our action slogan is: the fastest distribution speed, the best work quality, and the most enthusiastic service attitude.

Recently, another batch of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* has arrived. On the night the books arrived, although it was time to go off duty, everyone rushed to the warehouse. Some carried books, some packed them, greeting each other with smiles and joyful words. It was past nine o'clock, and we, several comrades who hadn't had dinner yet, didn't feel hungry at all.

The days of distributing Chairman Mao's works are our happiest days. On this day, colorful lanterns hang high, drums beat loudly, and both inside and outside the store are cleaned spotlessly. We are in high spirits, wearing new clothes, standing guard by the piles of books.

This is not the first time. A reader who had been queuing for two or three hours held the book with both hands, showing a hesitant look.

"Comrade, do you not have enough money?" one of our booksellers guessed.

"Uh! What should I do?" he replied, counting his money worriedly.

"It's okay, take the book first, and bring the money later!" Our bookseller took out his wallet to pay for him.

"Thank you, thank you!" He shook hands with the bookseller excitedly and left the counter. Suddenly, he rushed back.

"Comrade, what is your name?"

"A clerk at the New China Bookstore!"

How many booksellers have encountered such things?

Finally, let us quote a reader's words from a letter of thanks: "Care more about the Party and the people than about oneself, and care more about others than about oneself." Let us take the great leader's teachings as our eternal motivation to move forward!

    让雨露滋润人们的心
    ——售书员的一封信同志：
    为了使大家分享我们的最大快乐，我们写这封信告诉你们一些激动人心的事情。来自祖国各地的红卫兵，听到今天供应《毛泽东选集》，从昨天晚上起，就在我们新华书店门前汇集成一条长龙。在鞭炮声中，他们时而引吭高歌《大海航行靠舵手》，时而振臂高呼“毛主席万岁！”早晨，我们刚开门，好多人拥进来，千万双热情期望的眼睛朝着我们欢笑。啊！这是因为我们双手捧着金光灿灿的宝书。当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义的最伟大的著作——《毛泽东选集》，就是通过我们的双手，一部部地散发到广大读者的手中。
      “我买到了，我买到了！”一个从伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊同志家乡来的小红卫兵，从我们手里接过了《毛泽东选集》后，高兴地喊着。然后他在书的扉页上小心翼翼地写着：“干革命离不开毛泽东思想。今天，我买到了毛主席著作，今后一定要更加努力地活学活用，像刘英俊叔叔那样，做毛主席的好学生！”
    “你为什么要写在书上？”一位同志问道。
    “我盼呀，盼呀！好容易才买到，怎能不写几个字儿！”小红卫兵回答。
    “叔叔，我一定要像刘英俊叔叔那样学习毛主席著作。”小红卫兵激动地表示他的决心。
    这种动人的情景，到处都可以见到。多少人远从千里万里外寄来一封封书信。这些信，来自守卫中印边境哨卡的边防战士，来自跋涉在大兴安岭林海雪原的林业工人，来自出没在万顷波涛的西沙群岛的青年捕鱼能手，来自奋战在戈壁沙滩上的鬓发斑白的牧民……，他们怀着最激动的心情，表达了一个共同的愿望：最迫切地渴求得到《毛泽东选集》。从信里，好像看到他们都在呼唤：快呀！快快把毛主席的书给我们捎来！
    是呵，他们最真挚地热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席，最忠诚地敬仰伟大的毛泽东思想。他们如饥似渴地盼望读到毛主席著作。有的从几百里以外专程徒步来买，有的等书等了七年，有的买不到就迫不及待地借书来一个字一个字地抄在本子上，不知付出了多少辛勤的汗水。
    为了让阳光普照大地，让雨露滋润人们的心，我们的行动口号是：最快的发行速度，最好的工作质量，最热情的服务态度。
    最近，又一批《毛泽东选集》运来了。书到店的那晚，虽然要下班了，大家也都奔到库房，搬书的搬书，包装的包装，笑脸相迎，喜语相告。九点多钟了，我们几个还未吃晚饭的同志，丝毫不觉得饿。
    发售毛主席著作的日子，是我们最幸福的节日。这一天彩灯高挂，锣鼓齐鸣，店里店外洗刷得干干净净。我们喜气洋洋，穿着簇新的衣服，守卫在堆积如山的书旁边。
    这已经不是第一次了。排了二、三个小时队的一个读者，双手捧着书，露出了迟疑的眼神。
    “同志，您的钱不够吗？”我们一位售书员猜着说。
    “唔！怎么办？”他点着钱，忧虑地回答。
    “不要紧，先把书拿去，以后再把钱送来！”我们这位售书员掏出腰包替他垫了。
    “谢谢，谢谢！”他激动地紧握这位售书员的手后，离开了柜台。突然，又飞快地回来。
    “同志，您叫什么？”
    “新华书店的营业员！”
    这种事，该有多少个售书员同志也遇到过呢？
    最后，让我们摘录一位读者在感谢信中所引用的毛主席的话：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”让我们把伟大领袖的教导作为我们永远前进的鞭策吧！　几个售书员（附图片）
