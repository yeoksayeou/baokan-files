To make a revolution, one must read Chairman Mao's books.

Mao Zedong is the great leader of China. He is not only a great theorist of revolution but also a great practitioner. Europeans cannot understand how great and powerful Mao Zedong is. He has transformed a poor country into a prosperous new China in a short period. He has united seven hundred million people into one thought, one will, and one action. In the next five years, China will become the strongest and invincible country in the world. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, whichever country learns Mao Zedong's theory to make a revolution, that country will achieve victory, and imperialism will be powerless against them. Vietnam is an example, and so are the African countries. Our European countries also need Mao Zedong. Without understanding Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot understand the world today. Those who pursue knowledge should all read Mao Zedong's works.

    搞革命必须读毛主席的书
    毛泽东是中国的伟大领袖，不仅是一位革命的理论家，而且是一位伟大的实践家。欧洲人不能理解毛泽东是多么伟大、多么有力量。他能把一个穷国在短短的时间里变成一个富强的新中国，他能把七亿人口统一成一个思想，一个意志，一个行动。今后的五年，中国将成为世界上最强的无敌的国家。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，那一个国家学习毛泽东的理论搞革命，那一个国家就能胜利，帝国主义对它们也毫无办法。越南是一例，非洲国家也是如此。我们欧洲国家要好起来，也需要毛泽东。不了解毛泽东思想，就无法理解今天的世界，追求知识的人都应读毛泽东的著作。
