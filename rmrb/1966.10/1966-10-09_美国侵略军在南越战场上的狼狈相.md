The U.S. aggressor troops recently conducted a series of "sweeps" in northern South Vietnam, but were met with fierce resistance from the South Vietnamese liberation forces, resulting in heavy casualties. In mid-September, the U.S. Marine Corps suffered a major defeat in Quang Tri Province. On September 24, in the area south of the demilitarized zone in Dong Ha, two companies of U.S. Marines were routed by the South Vietnamese armed forces.

An advance copy of the October 10 issue of the U.S. magazine *Newsweek* published photographs taken by the magazine's war correspondent on the battlefield. These photographs fully expose the embarrassing plight of the U.S. aggressor troops. (See attached photos)

One American soldier, barely alive, is placed on a stretcher.
A wounded American soldier, with an injured leg, is supported by his comrades as he limps along, shouting, "I want to go home!"
The besieged U.S. aggressor troops are in a state of panic, utterly disheveled.

    美国侵略军在南越战场上的狼狈相
    美国侵略军最近在南越北部连续进行“扫荡”，结果遭到越南南方解放武装力量的猛烈打击，伤亡惨重。九月中旬，美国海军陆战队在广治省吃了大败仗。九月二十四日，在非军事区以南、东河地区，又有美国海军陆战队两个连被南越人民武装打得落花流水。
    提前出版的十月十日美国《新闻周刊》发表了该刊随军记者在战场拍摄的一些照片。这些照片充分暴露了美国侵略军的狼狈相。（附图片）
    一个奄奄待毙的美国士兵被放在担架上。
    一个腿部受了伤的美国兵，由同伴搀扶着一瘸一瘸地走着，嘴里大叫“我要回家！”
    被围困的美国侵略军惊恐万状，狼狈不堪。
