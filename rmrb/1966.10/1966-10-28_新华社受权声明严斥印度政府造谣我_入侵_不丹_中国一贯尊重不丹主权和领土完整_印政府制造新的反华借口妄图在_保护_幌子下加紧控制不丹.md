New China News Agency Authorized Statement Strongly Rebukes Indian Government's Fabrication of "Invading" Bhutan

China Has Always Respected Bhutan's Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity

Indian Government Creates New Anti-China Pretext in Attempt to Tighten Control Over Bhutan Under the Guise of "Protection"

New China News Agency, October 27th

On September 30th, the Indian government sent a note to the Chinese government, falsely claiming that Chinese herdsmen and patrol teams had "invaded" Bhutanese territory and purportedly representing Bhutan in lodging a so-called protest against China. Subsequently, the Indian government mobilized its propaganda machinery, loudly proclaiming "China invades Bhutan." Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi even personally engaged in anti-China propaganda, making it seem quite serious. In response, the New China News Agency is authorized to issue the following statement:

1. The Indian government's claim that China has "invaded" Bhutanese territory is a complete lie and a malicious slander.

2. The area known as the Donglang Pasture (referred to by the Indian side as "Dorlang Pasture") is located near the tri-junction of China, Bhutan, and Sikkim. It has always been under Chinese jurisdiction, and Chinese herdsmen have been grazing there for generations. Bhutanese herdsmen who cross the border to graze in this pasture have always paid the customary grazing fees to the Chinese side. In the latter half of 1965, Indian troops crossed the China-Sikkim border five times to infiltrate and harass the Donglang Pasture. The Chinese government lodged protests with the Indian government on August 27, 1965, and January 31, 1966. At that time, the Indian government did not deny the fact that this pasture belongs to China. Now, the Indian government claims that the Chinese side has "invaded" its own territory, which is absurd and laughable and not worth refuting.

3. China has always respected Bhutan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. China and Bhutan have always maintained friendly relations, with no invasions, and the border between the two countries has always been peaceful. The Bhutanese government itself has repeatedly refuted Indian fabrications about China's "threats" and "invasions" of Bhutan. Of course, the China-Bhutan border has never been formally demarcated. If there are any differences in understanding specific border alignments between the two countries, they can be resolved through equal consultations and mutual concessions, seeking a fair and reasonable solution. China has successfully resolved historical border issues with neighboring countries such as Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Afghanistan through friendly consultations. However, it must be made clear that the China-Bhutan border issue is a matter between China and Bhutan and has nothing to do with the Indian government. The Indian government has no right to interfere.

4. The King of Bhutan has solemnly declared, "Bhutan is an independent and sovereign state with the right to handle its own foreign affairs." However, the Indian government openly claims to represent Bhutan in lodging a so-called protest against China, displaying a typical big-power chauvinist attitude. The Indian government has inherited the legacy of British imperialism, pursuing an expansionist policy and bullying neighboring countries. It treats Sikkim as a "protected state," infringing upon Sikkim's independence and sovereignty. It seeks to strengthen control over Bhutan and obstructs Bhutan's rightful international status, even attempting to directly send troops into Bhutanese territory. The Indian Express in its October 6, 1966, editorial blatantly stated, "There is no formal defense pact between India and Bhutan to support the special relationship between the two countries. Unless the Kingdom of Bhutan specifically requests military assistance, India cannot help Bhutan deal with the border situation. (Bhutan) whether it will request such assistance is a big question." Following this, on October 7, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi publicly declared at a press conference: India has the obligation to protect Bhutan. This clearly shows that the Indian government's accusation of China "invading" Bhutan is not only to create a new anti-China pretext and sow discord between China and Bhutan but also to realize its ambition of tightening control over Bhutan under the guise of "protection." However, these despicable plots will not succeed. The Indian government's attempt to play the role of the thief crying "stop thief" will never cover up its ugly expansionist face.

### 新华社受权声明严斥印度政府造谣我“入侵”不丹  中国一贯尊重不丹主权和领土完整  印政府制造新的反华借口妄图在“保护”幌子下加紧控制不丹

    新华社受权声明严斥印度政府造谣我“入侵”不丹
    中国一贯尊重不丹主权和领土完整
    印政府制造新的反华借口妄图在“保护”幌子下加紧控制不丹
    新华社二十七日讯　九月三十日，印度政府给中国政府一件照会，造谣说中国的牧民和巡逻队“侵入”了不丹领土，并且自称代表不丹向中国政府提出所谓抗议。接着，印度政府开动宣传机器，大叫大喊“中国入侵不丹”，印度总理英迪拉·甘地也亲自出马进行反华宣传，煞有介事。对此，新华社受权发表声明如下：
    一、印度政府叫嚷中国“侵入”不丹领土，是彻头彻尾的谎言，是别有用心的诬蔑。
    二、印度政府所说被中国“侵入”的洞朗草场（印方称为“道朗牧场”），位于中国、不丹和锡金三国交界处附近，历来属中国管辖，中国牧民世代在那里放牧。不丹牧民过境来该草场放牧，均按惯例向中国方面交纳草钱。一九六五年下半年，印度军队曾五次越过中国—锡金边界侵入洞朗草场侦察骚扰，中国政府先后在一九六五年八月二十七日和一九六六年一月三十一日向印度政府提出了抗议。当时，印度政府并未否认这个草场属于中国的事实。现在，印度政府却硬说中国方面“侵入”了中国自己的领土，实在荒谬可笑，不值一驳。
    三、中国一贯尊重不丹的主权和领土完整。中国同不丹历来友好相处，互不侵犯，两国边境一直是平静的。不丹政府自己就曾多次驳斥印度方面捏造的关于中国“威胁”和“入侵”不丹的谣言。当然，中不边界从未正式划定，如果不丹方面对两国边界的某些具体走向，在理解上同中国方面有所不同，那完全可以由双方平等协商，在互谅互让的基础上，求得公平合理的解决。中国同缅甸、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、阿富汗等邻国，通过友好协商，都圆满地解决了历史遗留下来的边界问题。但是，必须明确指出，中不边界问题是中不两国之间的事务，同印度政府毫无关系，印度政府根本无权过问。
    四、不丹国王早已庄严宣布，“不丹是一个独立自主的国家，有权处理它自己的外交事务。”而印度政府却公然自称代表不丹，向中国提出所谓抗议，完全是一副大国沙文主义的嘴脸。印度政府一直继承着英帝国主义的衣钵，奉行扩张主义政策，欺压周围邻邦。它把锡金当作“保护国”，侵犯锡金的独立主权。它对不丹力图加强控制，竭力阻挠不丹取得应有的国际地位，甚至想直接派遣军队进驻不丹领土。《印度快报》在一九六六年十月六日的一篇社论中露骨地写道，“印度和不丹之间没有正式的防务条约来支持两国的特殊关系。除非不丹王国政府具体要求提供军事援助，否则，印度不能帮助不丹来对付边界局势。（不丹）是否会要求这种援助，这是个大问题”。接着，印度总理英迪拉·甘地十月七日在记者招待会上公开扬言：印度有义务保护不丹。这就完全表明，印度政府诬蔑中国“侵入”不丹，不仅是为了制造新的反华借口和挑拨中不关系，而且妄图在“保护”的幌子下，实现它加强控制不丹的野心。但是，这些卑劣阴谋是不会得逞的。印度政府玩弄贼喊捉贼的把戏，绝对掩盖不了它的扩张主义的丑恶面目。
