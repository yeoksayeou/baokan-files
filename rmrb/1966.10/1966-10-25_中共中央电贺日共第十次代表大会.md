CPC Central Committee Congratulates the 10th Congress of the Japanese Communist Party

	It is hoped that the congress will make contributions to the struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism with the Soviet Communist Party at its center; and make contributions to supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation and to the cause of strengthening the fighting friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan.

	New China News Agency, October 24th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on the 23rd to congratulate the 10th Congress of the Japanese Communist Party, which opens in Tokyo on the 24th. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	Dear Comrades,

	When the Japanese Communist Party is convening its 10th Congress, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China extends its warm congratulations.

	We hope that your congress will make contributions to the struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism with the Soviet Communist Party at its center. We hope that your congress will make contributions to supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation and to the cause of strengthening the fighting friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan.

	Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!

	Down with U.S. imperialism!
