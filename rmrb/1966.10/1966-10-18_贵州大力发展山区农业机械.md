Guizhou Promotes Agricultural Mechanization in Mountainous Areas

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guizhou Province, which has a relatively weak foundation in the machinery industry, has made significant achievements in developing mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural machinery suitable for mountainous areas. At present, this province can already produce a batch of mechanized and semi-mechanized agricultural machinery that suits local natural conditions. These include irrigation, soil improvement, cultivation, harvesting, power, agricultural and sideline product processing, and fertilizer application machinery.

Guizhou Province's agricultural machinery in mountainous areas has developed rapidly in a short period. This is the result of revolutionary workers reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The workers of the Kaili Agricultural Machinery Factory in Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, with a clear direction, high revolutionary spirit, and transforming spiritual power into material power, greatly improving the production situation. In the past, they could only repair and maintain equipment. Last year, they were able to produce water pumps and water hammer pumps in batches, which can be used for both irrigation and power generation. The Guizhou Electric Appliance Repair Cooperative Factory produced a 10-horsepower submersible electric pump, which is particularly suitable for extracting water from rock caves in Guizhou. It can extract 100 tons of underground water per hour from a depth of 20 meters.

    贵州大力发展山区农业机械
    据新华社贵阳十七日电　机械工业基础比较薄弱的贵州省，大力发展山区适用的机械化和半机械化农业机械，已取得显著成绩。目前，这个省已经能够生产一批适合本地自然特点的机械化和半机械化农业机械，其中包括提水、改良土壤、耕作、收割、动力、农副产品加工和施肥机械。
    贵州省的山区农业机械在短时期内有了比较快的发展，是广大革命职工读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的结果。黔东南苗族侗族自治州凯里农业机械厂职工们按照毛主席的教导办事，方向明确，革命精神昂扬，精神力量变为物质力量，生产面貌大为改观。过去，他们只能修修补补，去年已能成批生产抽水、发电两用的水轮泵和水锤泵。贵阳电器修配合作工厂，生产了一种十瓩潜水电泵，特别适合贵州地区提取岩洞水使用。它能从二十米深的岩洞内，每小时抽取地下水一百吨。
