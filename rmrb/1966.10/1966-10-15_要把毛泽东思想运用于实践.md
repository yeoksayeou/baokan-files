In the vast expanse of China, countless workers, peasants, and soldiers are studying Mao Zedong Thought day and night, and applying it to their practice. This is the reason why China is strong and full of hope. I am convinced that no matter what kind of reactionaries emerge in the future, as long as the people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, China will never change color. When I read about figures like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu, who studied Mao Zedong Thought and put it into practice, I feel my blood boiling. When I think of the people of Dazhai and Daqing, these devoted children of Chairman Mao who are dedicated to socialist construction, I am moved to tears.

    要把毛泽东思想运用于实践
    在广大的中国，有多少工人、农民、士兵，每天每时，一心一意地在学习毛泽东思想，并把它运用到实践中去。中国之所以强大，之所以充满着希望，原因就在于此。我确信，今后无论出现什么样的反动分子，只要人民用毛泽东思想武装起来，中国是绝对不变颜色的。当我阅读像雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄等学习毛泽东思想，并把它付诸实践的高大人物的事迹时，我感到全身热血沸腾。当我想到大寨人、大庆人，这些献身于社会主义建设的毛主席的好儿女时，我感动得流出了眼泪。
