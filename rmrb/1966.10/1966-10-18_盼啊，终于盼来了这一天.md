	At Last, the Day Has Come
	Xiao Gehui

	Under the morning sun, we arrived at the New China Printing Factory. As soon as we entered the gate, we saw thousands upon thousands of pledges and guarantees, all expressing a common resolve: "To print Chairman Mao's works as the overriding political task."

	More than a month ago, when it was announced that the New China Printing Factory would devote all its resources to printing Chairman Mao's works, the entire factory was filled with joy, with drums beating and cheers echoing. Some veteran workers excitedly said, "We've waited and waited, and finally, the day has come. We can now print Chairman Mao's works in large quantities." Some workers carefully inspected the machines, ready to accept the honorable task. At the mobilization meeting, everyone eagerly spoke, and countless words could not express the workers' boundless love for Chairman Mao. Countless songs could not express the joy of the printing workers in printing Chairman Mao's works. Listen to their oaths: "We will send Chairman Mao's books to the Great Wall, to the banks of the Zhujiang River, to the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains, to the shores of the East China Sea... Let millions and millions of Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world read Chairman Mao's books as soon as possible. Let the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of China and illuminate the world."

	For more than a month, the machines have been roaring day and night. The letterpress workshop is like a boiling sea, with one printing machine after another forming a mighty fleet. White paper rolls like waves, leaping and dancing. The giant high-speed double-sided printing machine caught our attention. A piece of white paper is fed in, and in less than a second, both sides are printed with clear characters. The workers told us that this machine is imported and, although large and foreign, it prints very quickly. But it always has one side that comes out dirty. This time, they are determined to make the high-speed machine print Chairman Mao's works. Let it be any foreign framework; we Chinese workers will dare to challenge it. Nine comrades took on the glorious task of breaking through. First, they formed a study group for Chairman Mao's works, studying before and after shifts, always carrying Chairman Mao's works with them, and always keeping Chairman Mao's teachings in their hearts. They said, "Only by studying Chairman Mao's works do we have the strength and wisdom." The nine of them became one, fighting day and night by the machines. The maintenance team's veteran workers and workers from other workshops all extended their enthusiastic helping hands. When the machines were running, they carefully observed and inspected. When the machines stopped, they disassembled and overhauled, making technological innovations. After countless sleepless nights, they finally installed new equipment on the foreign machine. Hey! This solved the problem of the back side being dirty. Now, this machine can do the work of four or five ordinary automatic printing machines.

	The workers, with their boundless love for Chairman Mao, completed this glorious task with the fastest speed and the highest quality. The typesetters skillfully set the type, and the machines spun quickly, with production increasing day by day. However, the binding workshop found it difficult to complete the massive binding tasks. Should they yield to the difficulties, or should they advance against them? The binders responded loudly: "We are determined, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They decided to rest the people but not the machines, working in three shifts around the clock, letting the machines run day and night. "Faster, faster, faster, even faster, better and better." This was their common wish. Some female workers woke up at night and rushed to the factory. Upon arrival, they found that it was still early for the next shift! Comrades persuaded her to rest, but she insisted, "I can't sleep at home, let me go to work early!" The workers cherished every minute and second, saying, "If we rest one minute less, the revolutionary masses can get one more book of Chairman Mao's works." The dinner bell rang, but the machines kept running. Several female workers brought food from the canteen, and everyone took turns eating and operating. In the workshop, we also saw a wide conveyor belt, like a long dragon winding around each workstation, sending piles of paper from one side to the other. This was also the workers' revolutionary creation and the crystal of their wisdom. One conveyor belt replaced five auxiliary processes, and one conveyor belt saved a lot of heavy physical labor. In this way, the assembly workshop's comrades excellently completed the production task.

	Publishing Chairman Mao's works and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the most glorious task for printing workers. Everyone feels extremely honored and happy to have contributed to publishing Chairman Mao's works. The workers are all spirited, and everyone is full of enthusiasm. They help each other, cooperate with each other, give convenience, and take on difficulties. The spirit of cooperation is flourishing.

	The three shifts of workers formed a closely-knit collective. The previous shift did its best to create good conditions for the next shift, preparing materials and cleaning the machines. The young people in the letterpress workshop formed a shock team. If a machine's progress was slow, they would rush to it, working hard to catch up. The comrades in the plate-making section just completed their tasks and looked for more work to do. They told the comrades in the inspection section, "Printing Chairman Mao's works is a supreme honorable task. We guarantee to do the inspection work well and contribute more to publishing Chairman Mao's works!" This is the voice of the entire factory's workers and the action of the entire factory's workers.

    盼啊，终于盼来了这一天
    肖歌辉
    迎着朝阳，我们来到了新华印刷厂。一进厂门，千张万张决心书、保证书，琳琅满目，表达了一个共同的信念：“把印刷毛主席著作作为压倒一切的政治任务。”
    一个多月前，当宣布新华印刷厂全部力量投入毛主席著作印刷任务时，全厂一片欢腾，锣鼓喧天，欢声如潮。有的老工人激动地说：“盼啊，盼啊，终于盼来了这一天，我们可以大量印刷毛主席著作了。”有的工人仔细地检查机器，等待接受光荣的任务。动员会上，人人争相发言，千言万语表达不尽工人同志对毛主席的无限热爱，千歌万歌唱不尽印刷工人印刷毛主席著作的幸福心情。请听听他们的誓言吧：“要把毛主席的书送到长城内外，送到珠江两岸，送到天山脚下，送到东海之滨……，让千千万万中国人民和世界革命人民尽快读到毛主席的书，让毛泽东思想的阳光照遍全中国，照亮全世界。”
    一个多月来，机器日夜轰鸣着，铅印车间就像是个沸腾的海洋，一台台的印刷机组成了威武的舰队，雪白的纸张如浪花般翻滚着，跳跃着。巨大的高速双面印刷机吸引了我们的注意。一张白纸放进去，不到一秒钟，两面已经印上了清晰的字。工人同志告诉我们，这种机器是进口的，虽然又大又洋，速度很快，但印出来总有一面是脏的。这次他们决心要让高速机也能印刷毛主席著作。管它什么洋框框，我们中国工人就是要闯一闯。九位同志担负了光荣的闯关任务。首先他们成立了毛主席著作学习小组，班前学，班后学，时时刻刻把毛主席著作带在身边，时时刻刻把毛主席教导记在心间。他们说：“学了毛主席著作，才有力量和智慧。”九个人拧成了一股绳，日夜奋战在机器旁。检修组的老工人，其他车间的工人同志都伸出了热情支援的手。机器运转时，他们细心地观察，仔细地检查，机器一停下，他们就拆的拆，卸的卸，大搞技术革新。经历了多少不眠的夜啊，终于在洋机器上装上了新设备，嘿！这一下就把背面脏的问题解决了。现在这一台机器能顶四五台普通的自动化印刷机。
    工人同志们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，以最快的速度，最高的质量来完成这一光荣的任务。排字工人熟练地排着字，机器飞快地转动着，产量日日提高。可是装订车间却难以完成巨大的装订任务。是向困难低头，还是迎着困难前进？装订工人响亮地回答：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们决定歇人不歇机，昼夜三班，让机器日夜转动。“快，快，快，快了再快，好了更好。”这是他们的共同心愿。有的女工深夜醒来，就奔往工厂。到厂一看，嘿，离接班的时间还早着呢！同志们劝她休息休息，她却要求说：“在家实在睡不着，让我早点上班吧！”工人们珍惜着一分一秒，他们说：
  “我们少休息一分钟，就能让革命群众多拿到一本毛主席著作。”吃饭铃响了，机器照常开动，几位女工把饭从食堂打来，大家轮流吃饭，轮流操作。在车间里，我们还看到了一条宽大的传送带，像一条长龙回旋在每个工作台旁，把一叠叠的纸从这边送到那边。这也是工人同志革命的创造，智慧的结晶。一条传送带，代替了五道辅助工序，一条传送带，节约了多少笨重的体力劳动。就是这样，装配车间的同志出色地完成了生产任务。
    出版毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想，这是印刷工人最光荣的任务。人人都为自己在出版毛主席著作中出了一把力，感到无比光荣，无比幸福。工人同志个个精神振奋，人人干劲冲天。互相帮助，互相配合，让方便，抢困难，协作之风大盛。
    三个班的工人组成了一个密切合作的集体。上一班尽量为下一班创造好条件，领好料，擦净机器。铅印车间的年青人组成了突击队，哪台机器进度慢了，他们就开上去，猛打猛冲，把进度赶上。铅版工段的同志刚完成自己的任务，就到处找活干。他们对检验工段的同志说：“印刷毛主席著作，是无上光荣的任务，我们保证把验收的活干好，让我们为出版毛主席著作多尽一分力量吧！”这是全厂工人的心声，更是全厂工人的行动。
