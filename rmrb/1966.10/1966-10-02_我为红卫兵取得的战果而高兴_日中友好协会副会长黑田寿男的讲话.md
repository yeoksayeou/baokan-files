	I am glad for the achievements of the Red Guards
	Speech by Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kuroda Junnosuke
	Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Kuroda Junnosuke, delivered a speech at the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The full text is as follows:

	Comrades who have gathered from all over the country to Beijing, Red Guards, workers, peasants, soldiers, and friends from all walks of life and all strata in Beijing:

	I represent the Japanese people who were invited to Beijing to participate in your national day celebrations and express our heartfelt thanks to you.

	I represent the Japanese people who have come to Beijing with the friendly feelings of the majority of the Japanese people towards you and express our heartfelt congratulations to you.

	Please allow me to express my sincere respect and praise for your great achievements in socialist construction under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and your successful progress in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an inevitable path to advance socialism. Without thoroughly carrying out this great revolution, socialism will inevitably degenerate into modern revisionism. Those who fear this great revolution the most are imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism. The Red Guards were born in this great revolution. I am glad for the achievements that the creative Red Guards, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have made so far.

	China has not only become a stronghold in the world people's anti-imperialist liberation struggle but is now resolutely opposing the nuclear threat of U.S. imperialism and serving as the rear base for the Vietnamese people, fighting alongside the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism.

	The Japanese people who love independence and peace are fighting against the Vietnam War, against the Japanese government's cooperation in the war of aggression, for the return of the largest base, Okinawa, and for the abolition of military bases on Japanese soil.

	The peoples of Japan and China have the common task of fighting against U.S. imperialism and its followers. To strengthen our struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, let us further strengthen the fighting friendship between our two peoples!

	The 17th anniversary of the founding of China is being held during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and therefore it has special significance.

	Long live the 17th anniversary of the founding of China! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese revolution! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the Chinese people who are resolutely fighting against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism! Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, who are strengthening their struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism! Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

    我为红卫兵取得的战果而高兴
    日中友好协会副会长黑田寿男的讲话
    新华社一日讯　日中友好协会副会长黑田寿男在中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝大会上的讲话，全文如下：由全国各地汇集到北京的红卫兵和北京市的工人、农民、士兵、红卫兵，以及各界、各阶层的朋友们：
    我代表应邀来北京参加贵国国庆的日本人向你们表示衷心的谢意。
    我代表带着大多数日本人民对你们的友好感情来到北京的人们向你们表示衷心的祝贺。
    请允许我对于你们在毛泽东主席领导下胜利完成巨大的社会主义建设，正在成功地进行无产阶级社会主义文化大革命，表示衷心的敬意和赞扬。
    无产阶级社会主义文化大革命是推进社会主义的必经之路。要是不彻底进行这一场大革命，社会主义就不能不堕落，那就是现代修正主义了。最害怕这场大革命的是帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义。红卫兵是在这场大革命中诞生的。我为在毛泽东思想指引下，具有创造性的红卫兵迄今所取得的战果而高兴。
    中国不仅成为全世界人民反帝解放斗争的坚固堡垒，而且现在亲自坚决反对美帝国主义的核威胁，成为越南人民的后方，和越南人民一起同美帝国主义进行斗争。
    热爱独立与和平的日本人民正在为反对越南战争，为阻止日本政府对侵略战争的合作，为归还最大的基地冲绳和废除在日本国土的军事基地而进行斗争。
    日中两国人民有着必须和美帝国主义及其追随者进行斗争的共同任务。为了增强向共同的敌人美帝国主义斗争的力量，让我们进一步加强两国人民的战斗友谊吧！
    中国的国庆十七周年是在无产阶级社会主义文化大革命中举行的，因此它具有特别重大的意义。
    中国国庆十七周年万岁！中国革命的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！无产阶级社会主义文化大革命万岁！正在对美帝国主义和现代修正主义坚决斗争的中国人民万岁！正在加强的同共同的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争的日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！全世界人民的大团结万岁！
