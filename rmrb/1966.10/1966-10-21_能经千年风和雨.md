	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
	The Red Guards always think of you.
	We will walk through iron shoes to go to Beijing!
	Our highest wish—to see Chairman Mao.
	Mother gave birth to me and raised me,
	My heart has never been so eager!
	After eating bitter herbs, we taste honey,
	How can we not love Chairman Mao!
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao,
	I finally saw you today!
	A poor peasant's son sees Chairman Mao,
	Is it in a dream or is it real?!
	An unforgettable moment has passed,
	A grand vision is engraved in my mind.
	Your encouragement and support,
	The Red Guards can stand through a thousand years of wind and rain!
	Red Guards of Yongding Middle School, Gansu

    能经千年风和雨
    毛主席啊，毛主席，
    红卫兵时刻想念您。
    踏破铁鞋也要去北京！
    最高的愿望——见毛主席。
    娘生我长到这么大，
    心从来没有这样急！
    吃过黄连再吃蜜，
    怎不热爱毛主席！
    毛主席啊，毛主席，
    我今天终于见到了您！
    贫农儿子见了毛主席，
    是在梦里啊还是真的？！
    难忘的一刹那闪过去，
    一幅宏图刻在脑子里。
    您的鼓舞和支持啊，
    红卫兵能经千年的风和雨！
    甘肃永登红卫中学一红卫兵
