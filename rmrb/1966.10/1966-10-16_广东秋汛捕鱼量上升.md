Fishermen along the coast of Guangdong Province have been engaged in autumn fishing since August, and their catch has been increasing month by month. Statistics show that the catch in August and September was more than 10 percent higher than in the same months last year.

This year, the coastal fishermen of this province have launched a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further establishing the idea of fishing for the revolution. During the autumn fishing season, they have been going out to sea early and frequently, displaying a revolutionary spirit of bravery, daring to fight and not fearing sacrifice, pursuing fish schools day and night.

    广东秋汛捕鱼量上升
    广东省沿海广大渔民从八月份开始投入秋汛生产以来，捕鱼量月月上升。据统计，八月和九月份的捕鱼量，都比去年同期增产百分之十以上。
    今年以来，这个省的沿海渔民掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，进一步树立了为革命捕鱼的思想。在秋汛生产中，他们纷纷早出海，勤出海，发扬勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲的革命精神，日夜追捕鱼群。
