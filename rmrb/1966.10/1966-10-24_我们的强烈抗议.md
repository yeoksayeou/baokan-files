On October 7, the Soviet government suddenly notified the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union of its unilateral decision to suspend all Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union and ordered them to leave the Soviet Union by the end of October. This is a blatant violation of the Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation agreement by the Soviet revisionist leadership, and a serious incident created to further deteriorate Sino-Soviet relations and stir up a new wave of anti-China hysteria. The Chinese people, numbering 700 million, cannot but feel indignant and express our strongest protest!

In making this unilateral decision, the Soviet revisionist leadership tries to justify itself with the so-called "principle of reciprocity." This is sheer nonsense. The whole world knows that China is in the midst of a great proletarian cultural revolution. The Chinese government, considering that all higher educational institutions in China have suspended classes, has notified foreign students in China to suspend their studies for one year. Those foreign students who have completed their basic courses can graduate early. Soviet students were originally scheduled to graduate at the end of this year, having completed their basic courses, and can graduate early. The Chinese government notified the Soviet side and proposed to agree on the time for these students to graduate early. However, the Soviet side did not respond to our proposal but recalled its own students and fabricated the lie that China had unilaterally decided to suspend Soviet students and order them to return to the Soviet Union within a specified time. This was used as an excuse to immediately order all Chinese students in the Soviet Union to leave. The Soviet schools have not suspended classes, and students from other countries are still studying as usual. Why did they suddenly order Chinese students to suspend their studies and leave the Soviet Union? This is utterly unreasonable. The Soviet revisionist leadership actually claims to be acting on the "principle of reciprocity," which is utterly despicable and shameless.

Chinese students in the Soviet Union are revolutionary youth nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They love the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet revisionist leadership fears that Chinese students will spread the great Mao Zedong Thought to Soviet youth and the Soviet people, and therefore regards Chinese students as thorns in their eyes. They fear and hate them to the core and have long wanted to drive them all out. Over the years, the Soviet revisionist leadership has created all kinds of difficulties for them and subjected them to all kinds of harassment. In 1965, there was even an incident where Chinese students participating in a demonstration to support Vietnam against the United States were brutally beaten. However, Chinese students have persisted in their studies and struggles, firmly defending the friendship between students and people of the two countries, and have not been intimidated by difficulties and threats. The Soviet revisionist leadership, finding no other way, has now concocted a ridiculous excuse to drive them all back to China, completely severing the contact between Chinese students and Soviet students and the Soviet people. This not only once again exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in destroying Sino-Soviet friendship but also fully reflects their weak essence of fearing the people, fearing the truth, and fearing the revolution.

At present, the Soviet revisionist leadership is on the one hand colluding with U.S. imperialism on a global scale and betraying the interests of the people of the world; on the other hand, it is madly slandering and attacking our cultural revolution and plotting a new anti-China farce. This gang of traitors is stepping up its anti-China activities to step up its collusion with the United States. The more they collude with the United States, the more they will step up their anti-China activities. The incident of driving out our students is part of their new anti-China high tide and one of the gifts they offer to U.S. imperialism.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has committed crime after crime in colluding with the United States and worsening Sino-Soviet relations, and has accumulated debt after debt. History will not forgive them. These debts will one day be settled. Their reckless and desperate actions will inevitably backfire on them.

    我们的强烈抗议
    本报评论员
    十月七日，苏联政府突然通知中国驻苏大使馆，单方面决定中国全体留苏学生休学，并限令于十月份离开苏联。这是苏联修正主义领导集团对中苏文化合作协定的粗暴破坏，是他们为了进一步恶化中苏两国关系、煽起新的反华妖风而制造的一个严重事件。对此，七亿中国人民不能不感到义愤填膺，并且表示我们最强烈的抗议！
    苏联修正主义领导集团在采取这一单方面的决定时，用什么“对等原则”来替自己辩解。这纯粹是无理取闹。全世界都知道，中国正在进行一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。我国政府考虑到，中国的高等院校已全部停课，所以通知各国在华留学生休学一年，那些基本课程已经学完的留学生，可以提前毕业。苏联的留学生原计划今年年底毕业，基本课程已经学完，可以提前毕业，我国政府通知苏方，提出同他们商定这些学生提前毕业的时间问题。但是，苏方没有回答我们提出的问题，就召回了自己的留学生，并且捏造中国单方面决定苏联留学生休学、限期返回苏联的谎言，作为口实，立即下令赶走全体中国留苏学生。苏联的学校并没有停课，各国留学生都在照样学习，为什么突然勒令中国留学生休学、离开苏联呢？这真是岂有此理。苏联修正主义领导集团居然说什么是根据“对等原则”，这简直是卑劣无耻到了极点。
    中国留苏学生是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的革命青年。他们热爱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，热爱伟大的中国共产党。苏联修正主义领导集团唯恐中国留学生把伟大的毛泽东思想传播给苏联青年和苏联人民，因此，把中国留学生看作眼中钉，对他们怕得要死，恨得入骨，早就想把他们统统赶走。几年来，苏联修正主义领导集团给他们制造种种困难，进行百般刁难，甚至还发生过一九六五年毒打参加援越反美示威的中国留学生的惨案。但是，中国留学生坚持学习，坚持斗争，坚决维护中苏两国学生和两国人民的友谊，不把困难和威胁放在眼里。苏联修正主义领导集团无计可施，就找了个荒唐的借口，把他们统统赶回中国，根本断绝了中国学生同苏联学生和苏联人民的接触。这不仅又一次暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团破坏中苏人民友谊的丑恶嘴脸，也充分反映了他们害怕人民、害怕真理、害怕革命的虚弱本质。
    目前，苏联修正主义领导集团一方面同美帝国主义进行全球性的大勾结，对全世界人民的利益进行大出卖；另一方面，疯狂地诬蔑和攻击我国的文化大革命，策划新的反华大丑剧。这一伙叛徒加紧反华，是为了加紧联美。他们加紧联美，也就必然要加紧反华。赶走我国留学生的事件，就是他们搞的反华新高潮的一个组成部分，是他们向美帝国主义献媚的礼物之一。
    苏联修正主义领导集团联美反华、恶化中苏两国的关系，犯下了一桩又一桩的罪行，欠下了一笔又一笔的账。历史是不会饶恕他们的。这些账总有一天要清算的。他们这样丧心病狂地胡作非为，必将自食其果。
