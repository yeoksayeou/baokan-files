The people of Albania are launching a vigorous production drive and striving for new achievements to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, which will be held on November 1, and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party (November 8).

Early this year, workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and cadres throughout the country enthusiastically responded to the Party Central Committee's open letter, implementing the Party's series of revolutionary measures with practical actions, and striving to achieve the best results to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Party and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labour. Now, on the eve of the Fifth Congress of the Party, the people of the whole country are even more spirited and full of fighting spirit, immersed in a hot production drive and a festive atmosphere.

On the industrial front, a new situation has emerged where production continues to increase, quality improves, and the variety of products increases. Dozens of industrial enterprises across the country have completed their production plans for October ahead of schedule. 85% of the workers at the "Stalin Textile Combine" have already completed their 1968 production targets ahead of schedule. Workers have also produced 26 new products in recent times. The "November 8" Sugar Factory in Korça, named after the founding day of the Party of Labour, produced 870 tons of sugar over quota in the first half of October.

Construction workers have launched a competition to accelerate engineering construction and strive to deliver new projects ahead of schedule. Before the Party Congress, more than ten new industrial projects will be put into production across the country, including the Elbasan Steel Rolling Mill and the Lushnje Paper Mill, which were built with the help of China.

The vast majority of agricultural cooperative members, state farm workers, and other agricultural laborers have also launched a production drive. At present, the harvest situation of corn, rice, and cotton across the country is better than the same period last year. The vast rural areas have declared October as a production month to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Party and the Party's birthday. Currently, autumn sowing is being actively carried out, striving to complete the sowing of wheat in October.

The Albanian people's army, which holds a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, has achieved great results in emphasizing politics, strengthening preparedness, and production this year. They have put forward the battle slogan of "Striving for outstanding achievements in political study, preparedness, and production to welcome the Fifth Congress of the Party and the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Party of Labour." By October 19, the army's land reclamation plan for 1966-1967 had been completed by 93%. Now the entire army is striving to complete this year's land reclamation plan before the Party Congress.

Artists have created and performed a number of new works and plays with high political enthusiasm to welcome the Party Congress and the Party's birthday, enthusiastically praising the Party, Enver Hoxha, and the new socialist life. On the eve of the Party Congress, the capital Tirana will hold a "Week of Arts" with more than 1,000 amateur artists and a large "National Exhibition of Fine Arts." All professional troupes in the capital will perform new revolutionary plays during the Fifth Congress of the Party. Some workers, peasants, and folk artists have also taken to the stage, singing loudly about the correct line of the Party of Labour, and through their own creations and performances, enthusiastically praising the great friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Albania, and praising Mao Zedong and Hoxha, the great leaders of the two peoples, expressing their boundless love and respect for the great leaders of the two peoples.

In various parts of the country, activities are being organized for workers, peasants, soldiers, young students, and children to visit the Party history museum, visit old Communist Party members, meet with representatives of the Fifth Congress of the Party, and hold Party history lectures.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民掀起生产热潮争取新成就
    新华社地拉那二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国人民正在开展热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛和其他各种活动，热烈迎接将在十一月一日召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和劳动党成立二十五周年（十一月八日）。
    早在今年初，全国工人、农民、军人、知识分子和干部就热烈响应党中央公开信的号召，以实际行动贯彻执行党的一系列革命化措施，争取以最好的成绩迎接党的第五次代表大会和劳动党成立二十五周年。现在，在党的第五次代表大会召开的前夕，全国人民更加意气风发，斗志昂扬，沉浸在热气腾腾的生产热潮和节日般的欢乐气氛中。
    在工业战线上，出现了产量持续上升、质量不断提高、花色品种大量增加的新局面。全国已有数十个工业企业提前完成了十月份的生产计划。“斯大林纺织联合工厂”的百分之八十五的工人已经提前完成了一九六八年的生产指标。工人们在最近期间还生产了二十六种新产品。以劳动党成立日命名的科尔察“十一月八日”制糖厂在十月份前半月就超额生产了八百七十吨糖。
    建筑工人们展开了加速工程建设、争取提前交付使用新项目的竞赛运动。在党代表大会召开前夕，全国将有十多个新的工业项目投入生产，其中包括中国援助建设的爱尔巴桑轧钢厂和卢什涅造纸厂等。
    广大农业社社员、国营农场工人和其他农业劳动者也积极掀起了生产热潮。目前，全国玉米、水稻和棉花收获情况都比去年同期好。广大农村为了迎接党的第五次代表大会和党的生日，宣布把十月份作为生产突击月。目前正积极进行秋种，争取在十月份内种完小麦。
    一手拿镐、一手拿枪的阿尔巴尼亚人民军今年以来在突出政治、加强战备和生产方面取得了巨大成绩。他们提出了“争取在政治学习、战备和生产中取得优异成绩，迎接党的第五次代表大会和劳动党建党二十五周年”的战斗口号。到十月十九日止，全军一九六六——一九六七年的开荒计划已经完成了百分之九十三。现在全军正争取在党代表大会召开前夕完成今年的开荒计划。
    文艺工作者为了迎接党代表大会和党的生日，以高度的政治热情创作和演出了一批新的作品和剧目，热情地歌颂党、歌颂恩维尔·霍查同志和社会主义的新生活。在党代表大会召开前夕，首都地拉那将举办有一千多名业余文艺工作者参加演出的“文艺周”和大型的“全国造型艺术展览会”。首都所有专业剧团将在党的第五次代表大会期间演出具有革命内容的新剧目。一些工农群众、民间艺人也纷纷登上舞台，放声歌唱劳动党的正确路线，并通过自己的创作和演出，热情歌颂中阿两国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结，歌颂缔造这一友谊的毛泽东同志和霍查同志，表达他们对两国人民的伟大领袖的无限热爱和尊敬。
    在全国各地，还正在组织工人、农民、战士、青年学生和少年儿童参观党史博物馆，访问老一代的共产党员，同参加党的第五次代表大会的代表会见，举行党史报告会等活动。
