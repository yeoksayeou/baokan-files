	The U.S. imperialists have been working tirelessly to peddle their "peace talks" deception on the Vietnam issue. They are doing this both within the United Nations and outside of it. Recently, the Philippine government advocated for some Asian countries to act as "sincere intermediaries" and "effective mediators" to promote "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue, which is a product of U.S. instigation.

	This "suggestion" was immediately rejected by Asian countries that uphold justice.

	On October 13, the Royal Government of Cambodia's Ministry of Information issued a statement pointing out: "Cambodia has rejected acting as an unjust intermediary in the Vietnam issue," and "it absolutely does not want to help promote such a peace: an unjust peace for the heroic Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against naked foreign aggression on their own soil; this is a peace that serves the conditions of the aggressors, benefits the aggressors, and harms the victims." What a righteous and stern voice! This fully expresses Cambodia's support for the Vietnamese people and its just stance against imperialist aggression.

	On the Vietnam issue, right and wrong are crystal clear. The only way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for the U.S. aggressors to immediately, completely, thoroughly, and cleanly get out of Vietnam, stop their aggression against Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own problems. All truly supportive countries of Vietnam should hold this stance. All countries that uphold justice should hold this stance. At a time when some are eager to mediate on the Vietnam issue without distinguishing right from wrong, Cambodia stands up and clearly points out that this "mediation" is a cover for U.S. aggression against Vietnam and harms the interests of the Vietnamese people who are fighting to resist U.S. aggression and save their country. Cambodia's clear stance in upholding justice is a powerful exposure and heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception.

	However, the Indonesian government immediately responded enthusiastically to the Philippine "suggestion" and took action. Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik said on October 10 that Indonesia "should not sit idly by" and "will take active steps" to promote "peace talks." Everyone can see at a glance that the Indonesian authorities are wearing the sheep's head of "sincere intermediaries" but selling the dog meat of the U.S. "peace talks" deception. In the end, they just want the Vietnamese people to give up their sacred struggle to resist U.S. aggression and save their country, and accept the "peace" of the U.S. occupying South Vietnam. This clearly shows that the Indonesian authorities are standing on the side of U.S. imperialism and are a new lackey of the U.S. in pushing its "peace talks" deception.

    柬埔寨的正义立场
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义为了在越南问题上兜售“和谈”骗局，真是煞费苦心。它在联合国里搞，也在联合国的外面搞。不久前，菲律宾政府鼓吹一些亚洲国家充当“真诚的中间人”和“有成效的调解人”，以促成越南问题的“和谈”，就是美国授意的产物。
    这个“建议”一出笼，就遭到了主持正义的亚洲国家的严正拒绝。
    柬埔寨王国政府新闻部十月十三日发表声明指出：“柬埔寨已经拒绝在越南问题上充当不正直的中间人”，“它绝不愿意有助于促成这样的和平：对于在自己的国土上为抗击赤裸裸的外国侵略而英勇地斗争的英雄的越南人民是不公正的和平；这是一种按照侵略者的条件，为侵略者的利益效劳，而损害受害者的和平。”多么义正词严的声音！这充分表达了柬埔寨人民支持越南人民、反对帝国主义侵略的正义立场。
    在越南问题上，是非是清清楚楚的。解决越南问题的唯一途径是美国侵略者立即、全部、彻底、干净地滚出越南，停止对越南的侵略，让越南人自己解决自己的问题。一切真正支持越南的国家应该持这样的立场。一切维护正义的国家应该持这样的立场。正当有人在越南问题上热中于进行不分是非的“调解”的时候，柬埔寨挺身而出，毫不含糊地指出，这种“调解”，是替美国侵略越南打掩护，是损害坚持抗美救国斗争的越南人民的利益的。柬埔寨的这种维护正义的鲜明立场，是对美帝“和谈”骗局的有力揭露和沉重打击。
    但是，唯独印尼政府，马上热烈响应菲律宾的“建议”，并且见诸行动。印尼外长马利克十月十日说，印尼“不应静坐不动”，“将采取积极步骤”促成“和谈”。人们一眼就能看出，印尼当局挂的是“真诚的中间人”的羊头，卖的是美国“和谈”骗局的狗肉。说来说去，他们无非是要越南人民放弃抗美救国的神圣斗争，接受美国霸占南越的“和平”。这就清楚地表明，印尼当局是站在美帝国主义这一边的，是美国推行“和谈”骗局的一名新走卒。
