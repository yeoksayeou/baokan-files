The junta in Ghana unilaterally and unreasonably severed relations between China and Ghana on October 20. This is part of the current anti-China tide stirred up by imperialism and international reactionary forces, and it is a blatant exposure of the reactionary nature of the Ghanaian junta.

Imperialism has always hated the brilliant victories of the Ghanaian and African peoples in their struggle for national independence. They have used every means to try to weaken the national liberation movement in Africa, to strangle the independent nations of Africa, so that they can once again control and enslave the African continent. The counter-revolutionary military coup in Ghana is a savage counterattack by imperialism, led by the United States, against the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people. Everyone can see that after seizing power, the Ghanaian reactionary military clique immediately sold out to American and British imperialism. They betrayed the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Ghanaian and Zimbabwean peoples, actively curried favor with British imperialism, and restored diplomatic relations with Britain. At the same time, they eagerly begged for "aid" from American imperialism. Over the past half year, the new colonialist forces of the United States have been rapidly infiltrating Ghana.

Imperialism also understands very well that the Chinese people firmly support the just cause of the Ghanaian and African peoples in their struggle for national liberation. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has great concern for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people. The brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong are rapidly spreading across Africa. The revolutionary situation in Africa is excellent. It is precisely for this reason that imperialism is terrified of the friendship between the Chinese people and the African people. Imperialism is carrying out extensive anti-China activities in Africa and is using some of its lackeys to do the same. The Ghanaian junta's frenzied anti-China activities and its recent malicious act of severing relations between China and Ghana are completely serving the imperialist conspiracy to suppress the African national liberation movement, and they blatantly expose its true nature as a lackey of American and British imperialism.

In today's world, those who oppose China are only imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries—they are just a small handful. As early as 1939, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Chairman Mao said: "A person, a party, an army, or a school, if not opposed by the enemy, that would be bad; that would mean they have gone over to the enemy's side. If opposed by the enemy, that would be good; that would mean we have drawn a clear line with the enemy." The frenzied opposition by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to China proves that the great Chinese people are firmly opposed to imperialism and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. They are the most loyal and reliable friends of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and all revolutionary peoples of the world.

The deep friendship and combat unity forged between the Chinese people and the Ghanaian and African peoples in their anti-imperialist struggle cannot be destroyed by imperialism and its lackeys. All those who oppose China will ultimately only lift a rock to drop it on their own feet, ending up in disgrace. The Ghanaian reactionaries who disrupt normal relations between China and Ghana will be no exception.

    搬起石头砸自己的脚
    本报评论员
    加纳政变当局在十月二十日片面无理地中断了中加两国的关系。这是当前帝国主义和国际反动势力掀起的反华逆流的一个部分，是加纳政变当局反动面目的大暴露。
    帝国主义从来都痛恨加纳人民和非洲人民争取民族独立斗争的光辉胜利。它们千方百计地企图削弱非洲的民族解放运动，扼杀非洲的民族独立国家，以便它们重新控制和奴役非洲大陆。加纳的反革命军事政变，就是以美国为首的帝国主义对非洲人民反帝革命斗争的一次猖狂反扑。谁都看到，加纳反动军人集团在篡夺政权以后，立即卖身投靠美英帝国主义。它们背叛加纳人民和津巴布韦人民的反帝革命斗争，主动向英帝国主义献媚，恢复同英国的外交关系。同时迫不及待地向美帝国主义乞求“援助”。半年多来，美国新殖民主义势力正在加速渗入加纳。
    帝国主义也十分懂得，中国人民坚决地支持加纳人民和非洲人民争取民族解放的正义事业。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，对非洲人民的反帝革命斗争寄予巨大的关怀。金光闪闪的毛泽东思想正在非洲迅速传播。非洲的革命形势大好。正是因为这样，帝国主义对中国人民和非洲人民的友谊害怕得要死。帝国主义在非洲大肆进行反华活动，也通过它们的一些走狗来进行反华。加纳政变当局疯狂进行反华，最近又中断中加两国关系的恶劣行径，完全是为帝国主义镇压非洲民族解放运动的阴谋效劳的，并且赤裸裸地暴露了它自己作为美英帝国主义走卒的真正面目。
    当今世界上，反华的无非是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，他们仅仅是一小撮人。早在一九三九年，毛主席就指出：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。毛主席说：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。”帝、修、反疯狂地反对中国，正好证明伟大的中国人民是坚决反对帝国主义，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争的，是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民和全世界革命人民的最忠实、最可靠的朋友。
    中国人民和加纳人民、非洲人民在反帝斗争中所结成的深厚的友谊和战斗的团结，是帝国主义及其走狗所破坏不了的。一切反华的人，到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，落得个身败名裂的下场。破坏中加两国正常关系的加纳反动派，也决不会例外。
