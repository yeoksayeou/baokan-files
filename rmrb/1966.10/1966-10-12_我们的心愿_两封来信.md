We are soldiers guarding the border of Tibet. Among us, there is a comrade who has a Chairman Mao badge. We regard this Chairman Mao badge as a priceless treasure, a symbol of strength, courage, glory, happiness, and hope. Whoever goes on duty wears it, whoever goes on patrol wears it. On countless nights, we gather around it to study Chairman Mao's works. Each of us has the wish to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. We will wear it to give a powerful response to all the class enemies, and we will wear it to defend the southwestern gate of our motherland!

In the days and nights of revolutionary struggle, we think of Chairman Mao every moment. Although we live far from the capital and cannot see Chairman Mao, having his badge on our chests and in our hearts makes us feel that he is always by our side. The more intense the struggle and the more complex the situation, the more we look at Chairman Mao's image and feel a surge of strength. It is as if Chairman Mao is holding up a beacon for us, guiding our direction, and cheering us on.

    我们的心愿
    ——两封来信
    我们是守卫西藏边疆的战士，在我们中间有一位同志有枚毛主席像纪念章。我们把这枚毛主席像纪念章当作无价之宝，当作力量、勇敢、光荣、幸福和希望的象征。谁出去执勤谁就戴上它，谁出去巡逻谁就戴上它，多少个夜晚我们围着它学习毛主席著作……。我们每个人都有得到一枚毛主席像纪念章的心愿，我们将戴上它，给一切牛鬼蛇神以有力的回击，我们将戴上它，坚守祖国的西南大门！
    在革命战斗的日日夜夜里，我们每时每刻都想着毛主席，虽然我们生活在远离首都的地方，看不见毛主席他老人家，但是我们有了毛主席像纪念章，佩在胸前，亮在心上，就总觉得他老人家近在我们身旁。斗争越是激烈，情况越是复杂，只要我们看看毛主席像，就浑身充满了力量，就觉得毛主席在给我们高擎明灯，在给我们指引航向，在给我们撑腰助威。
