To commemorate the 19th anniversary of the reissuance of the "Order from the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," broad masses of officers and soldiers held discussions and unanimously expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving the people and to pass on the glorious traditions of our army from generation to generation.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on October 9, October 10 marked the 19th anniversary of the issuance of the "Order from the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention." Many units of the People's Liberation Army held various activities to review Chairman Mao's great instructions, sharing their personal experiences and discussing their understanding of implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. The officers and soldiers unanimously agreed that the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, are a concentrated embodiment of the essence of the people's army and an important component of the army's revolutionary construction. They resolved to inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of our army, to keep Chairman Mao's instructions in mind, to implement them in action, and to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, and to the people, wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world.

The Concentrated Embodiment of the Essence of the People's Army

Many units of officers and soldiers discussed that Chairman Mao taught us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people is the sole purpose of this army." The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, are not just a few simple rules and regulations, but a concentrated embodiment of the essence of the people's army. Only a true people's army can have the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and can turn the implementation of these rules into the conscious actions of the broad masses of officers and soldiers.

The officers and soldiers of the 2nd Company of a certain unit said that different classes of armies have fundamentally different disciplines. The disciplines of reactionary armies of the exploiting classes are to protect the interests of the big landlords and big capitalists, and they commit atrocities against the people, such as burning, killing, and looting. The disciplines of the people's army, that is, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, are to protect the interests of the broad laboring masses and embody the fish-water relationship between the army and the people. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention have a clear class nature and are a concentrated embodiment of the essence of the people's army serving the people wholeheartedly. They are the fundamental mark that distinguishes our army from all reactionary armies of the exploiting classes. The officers and soldiers of the "Support the Government and Love the People Company" of a certain unit listed many advanced deeds and thoughts of their company in implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, further deepening the officers and soldiers' understanding of the essence of the people's army. One spring, this company was ordered to a certain place to carry out a mission. Upon arrival, they chose a riverbank to build their camp. The foundation was leveled, and the framework was erected. At this time, the local commune was preparing to turn this piece of land into a paddy field. Upon learning this, the Party branch immediately voluntarily gave the land back to the commune and even dispatched personnel to help the commune with production. The masses praised, "You are truly a good army trained by Chairman Mao!" Communicator Wu Kunjin once dropped a sapling while delivering a letter. At the time, he was in a hurry and did not straighten it. That night, back at the company, he felt uneasy. He used the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention to examine his behavior and felt that he had damaged the interests of the people and harmed the reputation of our people's army. Thinking of this, he immediately reported the incident to the Party branch and rushed back that night to replant the damaged sapling. Through the discussion, the officers and soldiers of this company said that the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention concentrate the essence of the people's army serving the people, loving the people, and relying on the people. We must forever be models in implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and forever maintain the original appearance of our people's army.

A Weapon for Uniting the People to Defeat the Enemy

The commander of a certain unit, He Fudong, used his personal experience to explain that the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, personally formulated by Chairman Mao for our army, are an important weapon for our army to unite the broad masses of the people and defeat all enemies. As long as we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions, and model ourselves on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, we can forever maintain a flesh-and-blood connection with the masses of the people, overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and ensure that the revolutionary cause advances from victory to victory.

He said that in 1941, he served as a platoon leader in a unit of the Eighth Route Army, and our troops were fighting against the Japanese in the Suixian Plain base area. The Japanese bandits launched a mad "sweep" against our base area. The places occupied by the Japanese bandits were filled with watchtowers, and the blockade trenches and blockade lines were like spider webs, attempting to strangle our anti-Japanese military and civilians. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, dispersed the main forces, mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and carried out extensive guerrilla warfare and sparrow warfare, flexibly and mobilely fighting against the enemy. In the struggle, we organized everyone to study the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention personally formulated by Chairman Mao for our army and related teachings on improving military-civilian relations, making comrades realize that we take up arms to fight the enemy for the liberation of the people, and therefore, in the war, we must love and protect the people. Only in this way can we unite the broad masses and obtain the greatest support from the broad masses. Although the struggle was extremely cruel and arduous, every time we arrived at a village, we propagated the anti-Japanese and national salvation to the masses, helped the masses sweep the yard and carry water, and strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. When leaving the village, we strictly checked the implementation of the people's discipline. Even in the anti-"sweep" battles, in moments of danger, the soldiers bravely sacrificed themselves to protect the interests of the masses. In this way, the masses all regarded our army as their own children, and a flesh-and-blood relationship was established between the army and the people. The masses, in order to protect us, also did not care about their own lives. Because we had the revolutionary masses as our backing, the entire Suixian countryside became a vast ocean of people's war. The enemy's every move, including the number of people, time, and place, was reported to us in a timely and clear manner by the masses, and the initiative of the struggle was always in our hands. In the process of annihilating a large number of enemies, our troops also became stronger and stronger, continuously growing and expanding.

The officers and soldiers of the 3rd Company of a certain howitzer unit discussed that when Sichuan was just liberated, our company was responsible for eliminating bandits, reducing rent, and returning deposits in a certain area. Initially, due to the enemy's deceptive propaganda and intimidation, some masses had reservations about us. We strictly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention on the one hand and vigorously propagated the Party's policies on the other, quickly dispelling the masses' reservations. The masses spread the word: the Red Army has returned. They flocked to us, quickly establishing militia organizations and various revolutionary mass organizations such as farmers' associations and women's associations, and successfully completing various tasks. Chairman Mao said: "The army must blend with the masses, making the army appear to the masses as their own army, and this army will be invincible in the world." We deeply felt that modeling ourselves on the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention is the family heirloom of our army for uniting the masses and defeating the enemy.

Forever Be Models in Implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention

Many units of officers and soldiers discussed the source of the consciousness to observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention during their study sessions. Everyone unanimously agreed that only by firmly establishing the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people can we most resolutely, most strictly, and most consciously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.

The officers and soldiers of the "Model Discipline and Love the People Company" said that Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving the people are the fundamental starting point and destination for implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Our company was nurtured and grown under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. According to Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving the people, we raised our proletarian political awareness and understood the reason for serving in the army and fighting for the people's interests. Therefore, everyone turned the strict implementation of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention into conscious actions. One day, the deputy platoon leader, Wang Yongze, bought five locks for four jiao each in the county. On his way, he found that one of them was of a different variety and better quality. He deduced that the clerk must have made a mistake. Wang Yongze remembered Chairman Mao's teaching in the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention about fair trade and immediately returned to the county to exchange it with the clerk. The deputy company commander, Liu Yonghuan, once directed the troops to conduct night exercises. When they were about to quickly pass through a large piece of sugarcane field, Liu Yonghuan timely issued an order that was not in the regulations: "Do not damage the crops!" Private Qin Deguang of the 2nd Platoon once found one yuan on the road while assisting the local area in training militia. He remembered that he had just seen a person riding a bicycle wiping sweat here, and the money might have fallen out when he took out his handkerchief. Qin Deguang immediately rushed like the wind along a small path towards the direction where the bicycle had gone, and after some twists and turns, finally found the person who had lost the money. Last year, the deputy squad leader, Chen Tuan, went home to visit and carried water for the five-guarantee households. He accidentally broke a small bowl on a child's hand by the well. He thought that the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention were precious for conscious observance and immediately took out two jiao, went to the child's home, and apologized in person. Our company has produced a large number of disciplined and loving soldiers, countless stories of discipline and love for the people, and many banners of discipline and love for the people, all of which are the shining Mao Zedong Thought of wholeheartedly serving the people.

The officers and soldiers of the 6th Company discussed unanimously that the power of consciously observing discipline comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. To more consciously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, to pass on this glorious tradition of our army from generation to generation, and to carry it forward and develop it, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on the "use" aspect, especially on transforming our worldview. The model soldier Chen Quannin said that once during a tactical training, a field of crops appeared on my path of advance. To quickly occupy the position, I planned to pass through the field of crops. Just as I was about to advance, the platoon leader ordered me to take a big detour around the field of crops. Although I obeyed the platoon leader's order, I could not understand it in my mind and thought that the platoon leader was deliberately picking on me, making me run a few more steps. Back in the barracks, I saw the words "Wholeheartedly serve the people and never leave the masses for a moment" written on the wall by Chairman Mao, which stirred up my thoughts. I re-studied the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and realized that the platoon leader was right, completely in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. At that time, I wanted to pass through the field of crops because I only thought of my own convenience and forgot the interests of the masses. From then on, I often continuously studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and observing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention also became conscious. Today, reviewing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention is to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, to make every action in the revolutionary struggle conform to the interests of the masses of the people, to forever be models in implementing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, to forever be loyal to the people, and to be good sons of the people.

    毛主席制定的三大纪律八项注意永放光芒
    纪念解放军总部重行颁布三大纪律八项注意十九周年，广大指战员纷纷举行座谈，一致表示：要牢记毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，把我军的光荣传统一代一代传下去。
    据新华社九日讯　十月十日，是《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》发布十九周年。人民解放军许多部队指战员举行多种活动，重温毛主席这一伟大指示，以自己的亲身经历，畅谈执行三大纪律八项注意的体会。指战员们一致认为，毛主席亲手制定的三大纪律八项注意，是人民军队本质的集中体现，是我军革命化建设的重要内容。决心继承和发扬我军的光荣传统，把毛主席的这一指示牢记在心中，落实在行动上，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。
    人民军队本质的集中表现
    许多部队指战员在座谈中说，毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”毛主席亲手制定的三大纪律八项注意，绝不是简单的几条纪律、规定，而是集中体现了人民军队的本质。只有真正的人民军队，才能有三大纪律八项注意，才能把执行三大纪律八项注意变成广大指战员的自觉行动。
    某部二连指战员说，不同阶级的军队有着根本不同的纪律，剥削阶级反动军队的纪律，是保护大地主、大资产阶级利益的，对人民是烧杀抢劫，无恶不作。人民军队的纪律，即三大纪律八项注意，是维护广大劳动人民利益的纪律，体现了军民之间鱼水般的亲密关系。三大纪律八项注意有着鲜明的阶级性，是人民军队全心全意为人民服务这一本质的集中体现，是我军区别于一切剥削阶级反动军队的根本标志。某部“拥政爱民连”指战员，在座谈中列举了许多本连模范执行三大纪律八项注意的先进事迹和先进思想，更加加深了指战员对人民军队本质的认识。有一年春季，这个连奉命到某地执行任务。抵达目的地后，选择了一块河滩地盖营房，地基平好了，房架也搭起来了，就在这个时候，当地公社准备把这块地垦成水田。党支部知道后，立即自觉地把地让给公社，并且抽调人力帮助公社搞生产。群众赞扬说：“你们真是毛主席教导出来的好部队！”通讯员吴坤金，一次递送信件时不慎踏倒了生产队的禾苗。当时忙着赶路，没有扶直。晚上回连后，心里一直不安。他用三大纪律八项注意对照检查自己的行为，觉得自己破坏了人民的利益，损伤了我们人民军队的声誉。想到这里，他马上把事情经过向党支部作了汇报，并连夜赶去把踏坏的禾苗补植好。通过讨论，这个连的指战员们说，三大纪律八项注意集中体现了人民军队为人民，爱人民，靠人民的本质。我们要永远做执行三大纪律八项注意的模范，永远保持我们人民军队的本色。
    团结人民战胜敌人的重要法宝
    某部部队长何福田，用自己的亲身经历说明，毛主席亲手为我军制定的三大纪律八项注意是我军团结广大人民群众，战胜一切敌人的重要法宝。只要我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，模范地执行三大纪律八项注意，我们就能永远和人民群众保持血肉般的联系，战胜一切困难，打败一切敌人，保证革命事业从胜利走向胜利。
    他说，一九四一年，我在八路军一个连队当连长，我们部队在冀南平原根据地坚持敌后抗日斗争。日本强盗向我根据地发动了疯狂“扫荡”。日本强盗占领的地方炮楼林立，封锁沟、封锁线像蜘蛛网，企图扼杀我抗日军民。我们按照毛主席的指示，把大部队化整为零，发动群众，依靠群众，广泛地开展游击战、麻雀战，灵活机动地打击敌人。在斗争中，我们组织大家学习毛主席亲手给我军制定的三大纪律八项注意和有关搞好军民关系的教导，使同志们认识到，我们拿枪打敌人就是为了人民的解放，因此，在战争中必须处处爱护人民。只有这样，我们才能团结广大群众，得到广大群众的最大支持。尽管斗争十分残酷、艰苦，我们每到一个村庄，就向群众宣传抗日救国的道理，帮助群众扫院、挑水，坚决执行三大纪律八项注意，离开村庄时，严格地检查执行群众纪律的情况。就是在反“扫荡”的战斗中，在危急时刻，战士们也勇于牺牲自己，保护群众利益。这样，人民群众都把我军看成是自己的子弟兵，军民之间建立起血肉感情。人民群众为了掩护我们，也都不顾自己的生命。由于我们有了革命群众做靠山，整个冀南农村，成了人民战争的汪洋大海。敌人每次出动的人数、时间、地点，群众都及时地清楚地报告我们，斗争的主动权一直掌握在我们手中。在大量消灭敌人的过程中，我们的部队也越战越强，不断发展壮大。
    某部榴炮三连指战员在座谈中说，四川刚解放时，我们连担任一个区的清匪反霸、减租退押等任务。起初，由于一些群众受到敌人的欺骗宣传和恐吓，对我们有顾虑。我们一面严格地执行三大纪律八项注意，一面大力宣传党的政策，很快地打消了群众的顾虑，群众奔走相告：当年的红军又回来了。纷纷向我们靠拢，很快地建立起民兵组织和农民协会、妇女会等各种革命群众团体，胜利完成了各项任务。毛主席说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下。”我们深深地体会到，模范地执行三大纪律八项注意，这是我军团结群众，战胜敌人的传家宝。
    永远做执行三大纪律八项注意的模范
    许多部队指战员在学习座谈中，还专门讨论了遵守三大纪律八项注意的自觉性从哪里来这个问题。大家一致认为，只有牢固地树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想，才能最坚决、最严格、最自觉地执行三大纪律八项注意。
    某部“遵纪爱民模范连”指战员说，毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，是贯彻执行三大纪律八项注意的根本出发点和归宿点。我们连是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，按照毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，提高了无产阶级政治觉悟，懂得了为人民利益当兵、为人民利益打仗的道理，因而大家都把严格执行三大纪律八项注意变成自觉的行动。二排长王永泽，有一天在县城买了五把四角钱一把的锁，走在路上，他发现其中有一把品种不同，质量较好，他断定是营业员同志拿错了。王永泽想起毛主席在三大纪律八项注意中买卖要公平的教导，立即返回县城向营业员做了调换。副连长刘永贤有一次指挥部队进行夜间演习，当要快速通过一大片甘蔗地时，刘永贤及时地传下来一道条令上没有的特别口令：“不要损坏庄稼！”二班战士秦德广一个人远离连队协助地方训练民兵，在公路上拣到了一元钱。他想起刚才曾看到一个骑自行车的人在这里擦过汗，钱可能是他掏手巾时掉出来的。秦德广立即一阵风似的抄小路朝自行车驶去的方向直追，经过一番周折，终于找到丢钱的失主。三班副班长陈团去年探家给五保户挑水时，不慎碰破了井旁一个小孩手上的饭碗，他想三大纪律八项注意贵在自觉遵守，便毫不犹豫地拿出两角钱，送到小孩的家里，并当面道歉。我们连涌现的大批遵纪爱民的战士，许许多多遵纪爱民的佳话，获得的一面面遵纪爱民的锦旗，都是毛主席全心全意为人民服务思想在闪闪发光。
    某部六连指战员在讨论中一致认为，自觉遵守纪律的力量，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。为了更自觉地执行三大纪律八项注意，把我军这个光荣传统一代代接过来，传下去，发扬光大，必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，特别是在改造世界观上狠下功夫。五好战士陈权新说，有一次战术训练当中，在我前进的道路上，出现了一片庄稼地，为了迅速占领阵地，我打算从庄稼地里通过。正当我要前进时，班长却命令我转个大弯绕过庄稼地。我虽然服从了班长的命令，但是思想上想不通，认为班长是有意找我的别扭，让我多跑几步。回到营房，我发现写在墙上“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的毛主席语录，激起了我的思想斗争。我又重新学习了三大纪律八项注意，认识到班长说得对，完全符合毛主席的教导。我当时想穿过庄稼地，就是因为我只想到自己方便，而忘记了人民群众的利益。从此以后，我经常不断地学习《为人民服务》，遵守三大纪律八项注意也就自觉了。今天，重新学习三大纪律八项注意，就是要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，在革命斗争中，使自己的一举一动都要符合人民群众的利益，要永远做执行三大纪律八项注意的模范，永远忠于人民，做人民的好儿子。
