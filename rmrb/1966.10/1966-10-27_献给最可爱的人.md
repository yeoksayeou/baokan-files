To the Editor,

Every time we see the Chairman Mao badge, it is as if we are standing by Chairman Mao's side, feeling an endless warmth and happiness throughout our bodies, feeling an inexhaustible strength. Seeing the Chairman Mao badge, we feel that our struggle has a clear direction, and we can advance bravely, invincible, daring to climb the knife mountain and descend into the sea of fire, advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

Although we greatly hope to wear the Chairman Mao badge on our chests to express our boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao, we understand even more the hearts of our beloved border guards. We have decided to give our Chairman Mao badges to the border guards because they are our most beloved people. They hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, and they are our examples to learn from. They should wear the Chairman Mao badges.

    献给最可爱的人编辑同志：
    每当看到毛主席像纪念章，我们就好像站在毛主席的身边，感到浑身充满着无限的温暖和幸福，感到浑身充满着使不完的力量。看到毛主席像纪念章，我们就感到斗争有了明确的方向，我们就能勇往直前，所向披靡，敢于上刀山，下火海，照毛主席所指引的方向前进！
    虽然我们非常希望能够在我们的胸前挂上毛主席像纪念章，以表达我们对毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬的心情。但是，我们更加了解敬爱的边防战士的心。我们决定将我们的毛主席像纪念章赠送给边防战士，因为他们是我们最可爱的人，他们把毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，他们是我们学习的榜样，应该让他们佩戴上毛主席像纪念章。
