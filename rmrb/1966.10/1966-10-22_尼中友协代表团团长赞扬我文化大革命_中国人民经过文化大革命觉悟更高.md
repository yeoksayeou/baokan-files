According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 21st - The leader of the Nepal-China Friendship Association delegation, Ganeshman Shrestha, told a reporter from our agency that for China to achieve complete success in socialist construction, it is extremely important and necessary to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, to destroy the old and establish the new. He said: This Cultural Revolution will definitely succeed because it has the support of the vast majority of the Chinese people. We are very happy to visit China during the high tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We have found that the Chinese people, after the Cultural Revolution, have a higher level of awareness in building their own country. More importantly, the Chinese people are all studying the works of Chairman Mao, using the works of Chairman Mao as their ideological weapon. Therefore, I think the Cultural Revolution is a heavy blow to those who dream of China's "peaceful evolution" and attempt to restore capitalism in China.

He praised the great achievements of China's socialist construction, which he attributed to the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. He hailed Chairman Mao as an extraordinary, outstanding, and great leader, and sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life.

    尼中友协代表团团长赞扬我文化大革命
    中国人民经过文化大革命觉悟更高
    据新华社广州二十一日电　尼中友协代表团团长加内什曼·什雷斯塔在这里对本社记者说，中国要使社会主义建设获得圆满成功，进行无产阶级文化大革命，破四旧，立四新是十分重要的和必要的。他说：这次文化大革命一定会获得成功，因为它得到了绝大多数的中国人民支持。我们很高兴在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中来到中国访问。我们发现经过文化大革命的中国人民，在建设自己的国家时觉悟更高。更重要的是中国人民都学习毛主席著作，把毛主席著作作为思想上的武器。因此，我认为文化大革命，对那些幻想中国“和平演变”和企图在中国复辟资本主义的人来说，是个沉重的打击。
    他称赞中国社会主义建设取得的伟大成就，是毛泽东主席领导的结果。他颂扬毛主席是不平凡的、卓越的伟大领袖，并衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。
