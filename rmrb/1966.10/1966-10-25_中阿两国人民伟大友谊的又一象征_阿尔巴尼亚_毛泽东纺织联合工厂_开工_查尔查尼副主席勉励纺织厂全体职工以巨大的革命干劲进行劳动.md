The "Mao Zedong Textile Combined Factory" in the Berat region of Albania held its official groundbreaking ceremony for the first phase (textile section) on October 22.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers Charcani, candidate member of the Political Bureau, Minister of Industry and Mines Theodhori, and Minister of Construction Dragoti attended the ceremony.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, Wang Jinchuan, and Chinese experts who assisted in the construction of the factory were also invited to attend the ceremony.

On this day, the textile combined factory named after the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, was decorated as if for a festival. Huge portraits of the great leaders of the peoples of China and Albania, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Hoxha, were hung high on the buildings of the factory. Tens of thousands of workers, cooperative farmers, and students from the Berat region sang and danced, gathering at the factory square to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony.

Charcani and Wang Jinchuan both spoke at the ceremony.

Charcani expressed gratitude for China's internationalist support and aid to Albania's socialist construction. He pointed out that the completion of the "Mao Zedong Textile Combined Factory," which is of great significance to Albania's economy, is a testament to the sincere internationalist friendship between the Albanian people and the Chinese people.

He encouraged all the workers of the factory to maintain the high honor of having this factory named after Comrade Mao Zedong by working with great revolutionary enthusiasm.

Wang Jinchuan, in his speech, highly praised the Albanian people for their heroic spirit of "one hand with a pickaxe, one hand with a gun" and their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle under the leadership of Comrade Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party. He noted how they overcame various difficulties created by imperialism and modern revisionism, achieving great successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Wang Jinchuan said, "This factory is named after the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. This fully embodies the Albanian people's love for Comrade Mao Zedong and is a symbol of the great friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. It is the strongest ideological weapon of the international proletariat."

    查尔查尼和王锦川先后在典礼上讲了话。
    查尔查尼表示感谢中国对阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设事业的国际主义的支持和援助。他指出，对阿尔巴尼亚的经济具有重大意义的“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”的建成，是阿尔巴尼亚人民同中国人民之间真挚的国际主义的友谊的证明。
    他勉励全厂职工为了保持这座工厂能用毛泽东同志的名字命名的崇高荣誉，要以巨大的革命干劲进行劳动。
    王锦川在讲话中高度赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民在霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，以“一手拿镐、一手拿枪”的英雄气概和自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，克服帝国主义和现代修正主义制造的种种困难，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就。
    王锦川说，这座工厂以中国人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛泽东同志的名字命名，这充分体现了阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛泽东同志的敬爱，也是中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国人民伟大友谊的象征。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，是国际无产阶级最强大的思想武器。（附图片）
