Reflecting the Glorious Achievements of the Chinese People Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao

The China Economic and Trade Exhibition, which reflects the repeated victories of Mao Zedong Thought, opened grandly in Kitakyushu City, Japan, on October 2.

The head of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition delegation, Xiao Xiangqian, delivered a speech, saying that the timely opening of the exhibition is the result of the struggle between the peoples of China and Japan against all reactionary forces that seek to disrupt Sino-Japanese friendship. It is a victory for the strong desire of the peoples of both countries to expand trade and develop friendly relations. Through visiting the exhibition, the broad masses of the Japanese people can learn about the glorious achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao.

He said that Chairman Mao has said: "Apart from the monopolistic capital and militarist clique in Japan that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." The Chinese people have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings, insisting on developing friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan and strengthening friendly exchanges. As long as we adhere to the three political principles, three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations, and resolutely fight against all reactionaries that disrupt Sino-Japanese trade, the future of Sino-Japanese trade is very broad.

The chairman of the "China Economic and Trade Exhibition West Japan Cooperation Association," Takada Hyakuki, the governor of Fukuoka Prefecture, Tokizaki Taichi, the mayor of Kitakyushu City, Yoshida Hatsuharu, and friends from various sectors all delivered speeches at the opening ceremony, emphasizing the great significance of developing Sino-Japanese trade and friendly relations.
