I came to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing, to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. Seeing that Chairman Mao is in excellent health and has a radiant complexion brought us the greatest joy and happiness. I wish our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

This time, I came with an empty pocket, to learn from the revolutionary people, students, and Red Guards of the capital. I want to learn from you how to study, implement, propagate, defend, and be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and bring it back to share and spread.

I would like to report to everyone on my experience of studying Chairman Mao's works.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Continuously Transform Oneself

To transform one's thinking and establish a proletarian worldview, the most important thing is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, to break with the old and establish the new, that is, to break with bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought.

Although I was born into a worker's family, before I read Chairman Mao's books and had Mao Zedong Thought in my mind, I was also influenced by a lot of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, even with a good family background, one still needs to transform one's thinking.

Before liberation, my grandfather was a bricklayer, and my father worked in the Fushun coal mine. He worked day and night but still couldn't eat enough or dress warmly. When I was three, my father worked himself to death from exhaustion. We had no money to treat him, and we watched him suffer and die. After my father died, our family had nothing to eat, so we had to send my 14-year-old brother to work in a factory. The boss and foreman often beat him until his face was bruised. My mother did odd jobs, mending clothes, and worked from dawn to midnight, but still couldn't make ends meet. We often went hungry. There was no choice but for me to go begging with my mother. I went barefoot, picking coal and digging wild vegetables. Once, while gathering firewood on a mountain, I was so hungry that I stumbled and fell down the hill with my bundle of firewood. I was covered in blood. When I returned home, my mother was so frightened that she cried out, "Poor child!" and hugged me, crying. In this way, I was soaked in the bitter waters of the old society for fifteen years. Comparing the bitterness of the old society with the sweetness of the new society, I love our great Party and our great leader Chairman Mao even more.

With such class feelings, in 1953, I entered the factory. After entering the factory, I wanted to give all my strength. I did whatever the leaders asked me to do, obeyed assignments, worked from dawn to dusk, fearing neither heaven nor earth, just working hard. However, because I didn't have Mao Zedong Thought in my mind and hadn't established the worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, I couldn't resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. My thoughts often went astray. I studied die casting, which is highly specialized and relatively simple in technology. At that time, some of my colleagues who entered the factory with me studied drawing or machining. Among some people, there was an incorrect saying: "Machining, fitting, and milling are not comparable, stamping, riveting, and welding are just makeshift, and if you do casting, you might as well go home." I thought, although die casting is a bit better than casting, it is still not as good as learning machining and milling. This thought made me less enthusiastic about my work. I wanted to talk about it at home but was afraid my brother would criticize me. I wanted to talk to the master but was afraid the master would think I was not good. Not saying it, it was still a matter. Under the influence of this thought, whenever I had free time, I would go to Master Kong Zhaobin's lathe to watch, the more I watched, the more I wanted to learn machining. The foreman saw through my thoughts and talked to me, saying, "Don't stand on one mountain and look at another. Think about how in the old society, we workers worked to feed our wives and children. Without skills, we couldn't make a living, and even with some skills, we were still slaves to the capitalists. In the new society, it's different. No matter what work we do, it's for the people. No matter what job we do, it's for the revolution. No matter what job we do, it's for building socialism, and it's what the Party needs." I thought, the leader is right! I haven't done anything for the Party yet, and I'm already picking and choosing my work. Is that right? After that, I didn't wander around anymore and was more dedicated to my work.

Not long after, one day, I went to work wearing a white shirt and combed my hair neatly. While working, I was afraid to get my clothes dirty, so I didn't have the usual vigor. Foreman Tang Shizhen saw that I was dressed differently from usual and talked to me, asking me why I was dressed so nicely today. I was asked until my face turned red and my neck swelled. I told the foreman my thoughts. Some female colleagues in the dormitory complained that I was dirty, had oil and dirt on my body, and always played with yellow mud to make models, not like a girl at all, but like a silly boy, a crazy girl, not tidy and clean. I heard these words and felt that they were right. Now that I was at work, I should dress like a girl. So, I changed into new clothes. With no hair oil, I used water from soaked elm bark to apply to my head. At that time, the foreman pointed out to me: It's not that you wearing a new shirt is wrong, but why change into new clothes to work? Here, there is a question of what to pursue. Having oil on your body is not scary, but what's scary is that our thoughts are not clean. You wear a new shirt today, apply elm bark water tomorrow, you might want to wear better clothes the next day, you might want to use hair oil, and you might be afraid of this and that while working. If this develops, it is very dangerous.

From these two incidents, it is clear that a person, without arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and establishing a proletarian worldview, even if they have a good family background, cannot resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

I started reading Chairman Mao's books in 1954. One day, the branch secretary talked to me, asking, "Fengying, why do you come early and leave late, working so hard?" I immediately said, "To repay the Party's kindness!" The branch secretary asked, "After repaying the Party's kindness, what then?" I thought for a long time but couldn't answer. Then the branch secretary patiently said to me, "We work in the factory, not just to repay the Party's kindness. Just knowing how to repay is not enough, the most important thing is to serve the people wholeheartedly, to revolutionize." He talked to me about some principles of establishing a revolutionary worldview and gave me a few single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, asking me to go back and read them carefully, think about how to work in the future.

After work, I returned to the dormitory and read those few books over and over again. The more I thought, the more I felt that the branch secretary's words were right. Not establishing the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly would lead to personal gain. I thought of how I was not dedicated to my specialized work, wasn't that for personal gain? From the perspective of personal interests, when personal interests conflict with the Party's interests, one cannot consciously serve the Party's interests. Thinking of this, I was shocked and realized that just having the thought of repaying the kindness was not enough to do a good job. Although I initially found the root cause of not being dedicated to work, I still didn't understand that only by thoroughly transforming one's thinking could the problem be fundamentally solved. So, I made three plans: not to quarrel over jobs, not to quarrel over wages, and not to quarrel over rewards. I felt that doing these three things was serving the people wholeheartedly. This was actually a low standard.

At that time, my brother had volumes one to three of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," so I flipped through them and felt that Chairman Mao's words were all spoken to my heart. The more I read, the more I loved reading. However, at that time, I still didn't realize the importance of using Chairman Mao's books to guide my actions, let alone actively applying them. I only knew that Chairman Mao's words were right and that I must listen to Chairman Mao's words. In this way, when encountering some problems, I would unconsciously act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. In the process of doing so, I tasted some sweetness, and thus gradually realized the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works and became more enthusiastic about learning. At the beginning, because I didn't have "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," I borrowed my brother's and copied some important articles, about fifty thousand words. In 1959, the National Labor Model Conference gave each representative a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." I thought this was a great call from the Party Central Committee for us to lead the way in production and work, and even more to lead the way in reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and walking the road of revolutionization. From then on, I was more conscious about studying Chairman Mao's works. No matter how busy the work was, no matter how late I slept, I always made time to study a bit every day. If I didn't study, it felt like something was missing. I also started to study with my own problems.

In March 1963, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," which made me realize that Comrade Lei Feng could become a great communist warrior, the most fundamental reason was that he armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought. I took Lei Feng as an example, found five gaps, the first being that my understanding of studying Chairman Mao's works was insufficient, not like Lei Feng, who treated Chairman Mao's books as air, food, and steering wheel, and not like Lei Feng, who used Mao Zedong Thought to transform himself and guide his actions. From then on, I was not just studying a bit every day at home, but finding ways to squeeze time to study. Walking to work, which took about ten minutes, I would write a quote on my hand and study while walking; when I arrived at the workshop, I would also remember the quote. Before meetings, when people hadn't arrived yet, I would use that time to study a bit. In the sanatorium, in the morning before others woke up, I would stick my head out the window to study. At night, after others went to sleep, I would study Chairman Mao's books in the hallway. When going out for meetings, waiting for the train at the station, on the bus, or on the train, these were all good opportunities to study. At this time, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's works were our spiritual food, the driving force of our work. If we didn't study for a moment, we would lose direction and strength. So, the more I studied, the more energetic I became, the brighter my eyes became, and the more revolutionary spirit I had.

Through continuous study, I realized that to thoroughly transform one's thinking, one must consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" all one's life.

In 1956, the factory implemented wage examinations and promotions. The young workers who came with me were all preparing for the exams. At that time, I was researching a technical improvement with everyone. The workshop leaders and masters were afraid it would affect my exam promotion, so they repeatedly advised me to put the innovation aside and do it after the exam. I thought, the exam promotion was a personal matter, and doing innovation was for the revolution. Thinking of this, I decided to continue the experiment. On the day of the exam, my comrades came to persuade me to participate. They spoke, and I was moved. I tidied up and left. I hadn't gone far when I thought it was wrong. Chairman Mao clearly taught us that personal interests must unconditionally serve the Party's interests, putting revolutionary interests first, but I put down the innovation and went to take the exam, wasn't that putting personal interests first, going against Chairman Mao's teachings? Doing innovation was revolutionizing, and revolutionizing must be done to the end. So, I turned back. Later, I felt that I didn't participate in the exam, which was one level lower than others, but I felt that I listened to Chairman Mao's words and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide my actions, and I felt that I did the right thing, and my heart was very happy.

Once, during a small group evaluation, some comrades fought fiercely for more bonuses. I saw this situation and thought of Chairman Mao's teachings. We work for the people's interests. The people have already given us rewards, and if we ask for bonuses, it's redundant. Extending your hand to fight for it is wrong, and even if you don't fight for it, taking it is also wrong. Thinking of this, I decided to firmly not take the innovation bonus anymore. So, I gave away several hundred yuan of innovation bonuses the state gave me over the years, part of which was used to buy Chairman Mao's works for everyone, and part of which was used as activity funds for the Red and Expert Team.

Once, I went to a sister factory to visit and saw that they still had some manual operations, so I thought there was nothing to learn. In the evening, when recalling the day's situation, I felt that the harvest was not great. I brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "We must not become complacent and self-satisfied when we see achievements." Chairman Mao also said, "Even if our work has achieved extremely great results, there is no reason to be arrogant and self-satisfied." I read these words over and over again, the more I read, the more I felt that Chairman Mao was talking to me, my heart was warm, and my face was hot, and I didn't sleep well that night. At this time, I realized that "humility makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." Not starting from zero would make oneself stagnate. So, the next day, I made a self-criticism to the branch.

A knife that is not wiped after use will rust and become thicker; a person's thoughts that are not transformed will also rust and become thicker, until they decay. Chairman Mao teaches us, "The enemy will not be eliminated by itself." The enemy of thought is the same. To deal with the enemy of thought, we must use Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest weapon, to fiercely fight it and defeat it. I also felt that the enemy of thought is different from the enemy with guns. The enemy with guns, if one is killed, there is one less; the enemy of thought is different. Today, if it is defeated here, it will pop up there tomorrow. So, it must be fought continuously, at all times, and it must not be fought on a case-by-case basis, but must be fought at its root. To do this, there is no other way but to honestly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly establishing a proletarian worldview.

Listening to Chairman Mao's Words, Never Forgetting Class Struggle

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us, "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." In revolutionary practice, I deeply realized that in a socialist society, class and class struggle still exist, and this struggle is sharp and complex. Class enemies are always trying to restore capitalism in China.

When I first entered the factory, I followed apprentice Wang Ruwen. Wang Ruwen's words and actions were always different from other masters. Whenever I had free time, I would help other masters with some work, but he was not happy and said I was meddling in other people's business. One day, I saw that there were defective products in his work, so I picked them out and set them aside. He saw this and was not happy, saying, "You have nothing to do, why are you picking it out?" I said, "These are all defective." He glared at me and said, "Say you're stupid, you're stupid. Putting it in doesn't it count?" I said, "How can that be? Isn't that deceiving people?" "Deceiving or not deceiving, it doesn't matter to you." Saying this, he mixed the defective products back in. I saw this and felt that he was not a true master of the state, not like a worker at all, so I immediately reported his activities to the branch. The branch secretary told me, "You can reflect the situation in time, that's good." And asked me to be vigilant and pay attention to his activities. Later, during the great suppression of counter-revolutionaries, under the exposure and denunciation of our workers, after the organization conducted a detailed investigation, it turned out that Wang Ruwen was a historical counter-revolutionary who had infiltrated our worker ranks. The people's government arrested him according to law. This living fact gave me a deep lesson, making me personally experience that the enemies with guns have been defeated by us, but the enemies without guns still exist, and they are still trying to infiltrate into the enterprise and worker ranks. We must always be vigilant to be able to see clearly, stand firmly, and resist firmly in the great waves of class struggle, actively and proactively fight against class enemies.

In production struggle and scientific experiments, there is also fierce class struggle. In 1956, our group's production was very tense, and my process was very busy. To change this passive situation, after repeated pondering, I found that the processing methods of the upper and lower processes were basically the same. If the two processes were combined, a lot of time could be saved. The masters also said this method was feasible. With the support of the workshop leaders and the help of the technical group, after many experiments, it was finally successful, and the manual deburring process became semi-mechanized, saving manpower and equipment and improving production efficiency. I and my comrades were very happy. However, when we asked the factory technical department to approve the process change, the responsible engineer disagreed, shaking his head and saying, "No, this is Soviet data, it can't be changed at will." We argued with him, but he insisted it was not possible, making us very angry. Chairman Mao teaches us that things are constantly developing and changing, why does he cling to Soviet data and not believe in our workers, but believe in the books? We were very angry. He disagreed, so I went to the factory director to solve the problem and reported the situation to the leadership. The next day, they braved the rain to come to the workshop, personally saw our experiments, and agreed to our improvements. At this time, that engineer was forced to lower his head and kept quiet.

I deeply felt that to revolutionize, one must fight. Not only must one fight against production and technical difficulties, but one must also dare to fight against old habits and conservative ideas, fight against bourgeois technical "authorities," and fight against foreign frameworks and dogmas that bind the masses' hands. Only by continuously fighting and continuously achieving new victories can our revolutionary cause continuously advance.

Class struggle is long-term, complex, and sometimes very fierce. In 1957, the right-wing elements in Shenyang, Gao Feng, used helping the Party with rectification as a pretext, publicly slandered the socialist construction high tide as "high grass," attacked the Party's leadership, and incited conflicts between the Party and the masses. Later, when he saw the situation was not good, he ran to his daughter's house in our factory to "avoid the wind." We heard this and were very angry. I and the youth went to his door together, questioned Gao Feng, and asked him until he was speechless, with beads of sweat as big as beans rolling down his face, like a frost-bitten eggplant, and he admitted his guilt. At this time, the right-wing element Chen Jing in our workshop was also fiercely attacking the Party's leadership. We also fought against him face to face, and everyone severely refuted his fallacies and defeated Chen Jing.

Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the denunciation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country, the arrogant attacks of the bourgeois right-wing elements were defeated, but the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has not ended. In 1964, the criticism of Yang Xianzhen and Feng Ding was a continuation of this struggle. Yang Xianzhen put forward the fallacy of "merging into one," openly opposing Chairman Mao's "divide into two" viewpoint, saying that the exploiting class and the exploited class can merge into one, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat can merge into one, can coexist peacefully, and do not need to struggle, all of which are nonsense. Seeing this, I was so angry that my lungs almost burst. This made me think of my family's sufferings in the old society. My family of three generations suffered under the capitalists' whips, where was the way for us workers? My father was tortured to death by the capitalists. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who led us to stand up, making us, who were once beasts of burden for the capitalists in the old society, the masters of the state. But the bourgeoisie is not willing to admit defeat and is trying every means to restore capitalism, trying to overthrow the heavens, and we workers will firmly fight against them. But Yang Xianzhen advocated "merging into one," eliminating class struggle, which was clearly speaking for the bourgeoisie, aiding the bourgeoisie's restoration. Thinking of this, I could no longer bear it. Absolutely, we must not let their plots succeed. With a heart full of class hatred, I took up my hammer and picked up my pen, writing a critical article. I used Chairman Mao's "divide into two" viewpoint as a weapon and my personal experiences and the vivid facts of our Red and Expert Team to refute Yang Xianzhen's reactionary fallacies and expose their reactionary plots. At that time, I thought, my cultural level was low, and Yang Xianzhen was what "authority," feeling a bit difficult. But when I thought that this was a serious class struggle, a matter of defending proletarian dictatorship, a matter of defending Chairman Mao, the responsibility of defending proletarian dictatorship, defending the Party and Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, urged me to feel that nothing was difficult, nothing to be afraid of, and all "authorities" were not worth mentioning. In addition to writing a critical article of Yang Xianzhen, I also wrote a critical article of Feng Ding's reactionary bourgeois viewpoint.

Through fighting against Yang Xianzhen and Feng Ding, I saw with my own eyes that all bourgeois "authorities" were paper tigers in front of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in front of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, all of them could be fought down, fought over, and fought rotten, making them never able to rise again.

Currently, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing victoriously across the country, achieving one great victory after another, and exposing a handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought right-wing elements. These right-wing elements who have infiltrated into the Party are viciously attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, attacking the great Mao Zedong Thought, and their goal is to restore capitalism in China. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible! Whoever opposes our great leader Chairman Mao, opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought, we workers, peasants, and soldiers will fight to the end, even if it costs our lives!

From my personal experience, I deeply feel that the flesh and blood of our revolutionary people are connected with the Party and Chairman Mao. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we would have nothing. The ship sails the sea relying on the helmsman, Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution; all things grow relying on the sun, Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolution. The more the enemy opposes Mao Zedong Thought, the more they fear Mao Zedong Thought, the more we workers, peasants, and soldiers love Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must study Mao Zedong Thought diligently. Especially in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, study in struggle, use in struggle, master the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, fight against class enemies, until we fight down, fight over, and fight rotten those in power who are taking the capitalist road, making them never able to rise again!

With Mao Zedong Thought as the Guideline, Strive for Technological Innovation

To innovate technology, I feel the most important thing is to be under the Party's leadership, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline. One must have the thought of innovating for the revolution, continuously fighting against various wrong thoughts; one must have the revolutionary spirit, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to venture, dare to do, dare to revolutionize, repeatedly practice, fear no failure, and revolutionize continuously; one must rely closely on the collective, rely on the masses, and innovate with collective wisdom and strength.

In 1953, I had only been in the factory for four months and found it very difficult to operate independently. At that time, the workshop's production tasks were heavy. Because I was not skilled, I couldn't complete the production schedule every day, so I came early and left late, worked overtime, and struggled hard, but the problem was not solved. I was really anxious, the more anxious, the more I increased the cutting amount. The cutting amount was already large, but I still felt it was slow, fiddling around, and the knife broke. This time, the production efficiency was even lower, making me cry. Master Li Yushu, who was working nearby, came over to comfort me and pointed out that the main reasons for my low work efficiency were two: one was slow feeding, and the other was picking out the aluminum dross, which took time. He let me think about these two problems, find tricks, and not just rely on physical strength.

Following Master Li's instructions, I pondered all day how to feed quickly and how to automatically separate the aluminum dross from the parts. I thought about it in the factory, in the dormitory, and on the way. Later, I saw that the door of the canteen could automatically close, and the construction workers sifted sand to separate the stones from the sand. Inspired by these two things, I thought there was a way, so I discussed it with Masters Li Yushu and Song Dianwu. With their specific help, I created a semi-automatic handle and an automatic feeder. After these two innovations were implemented, the production efficiency was increased by eighty percent, and the annual production task was completed 118 days ahead of schedule. I thought, "Tricks" are really powerful! Before, I worked from dawn to midnight and still couldn't complete the task. After finding a "trick," the problem was solved in an instant, contributing to the resistance against America and aid to Korea, truly a good "treasure." In the future, I must continue this path.

After the first innovation, I tasted the sweetness and always pondered how to find "tricks." I looked at this machine, touched that equipment, and whenever I found a problem, I wanted to change it. With the Party's leadership and the help of the masters, from 1953 to 1957, I implemented more than 170 innovation projects.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Three cobblers with their wits combined make a Zhuge Liang." I think so! One person innovating is a lone warrior, but organizing together makes the strength great. One person producing a hundred products is still only a hundred, but a hundred people each producing ten is a thousand, what great strength! Only by organizing together can we fully tap into the collective wisdom and accelerate socialist construction.

I reported this idea to the Party branch. The Party branch supported my opinion. When I discussed it with the masters, one master quietly said to me, "Fengying, have you thought about it? In terms of culture, the young people are all better than you, and in terms of technology, the masters are all better than you. If we organize together to innovate, who will get the credit if we succeed? How will you get the results to attend the labor model conference next year?" I said, "Being a labor model or not is a small matter. As long as it is beneficial to the Party's cause, we should do it. A Communist Party member should not consider personal gain first when encountering things." After I explained this, that master also agreed. On March 6, 1958, a part-time technical innovation small group was established by lathe operator Feng Xilian, stamping worker Liang Baocheng, and me. As soon as this small group was established, the advantages of organization were immediately shown. Soon, it developed from one small group to three small groups, and later changed to the part-time technical innovation Red and Expert Team.

To make everyone have a unified thought, that is, to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all the activities of the Red and Expert Team, a system of studying Chairman Mao's works was established in the Red and Expert Team. Over the years, we have studied Chairman Mao's works according to the principle of "studying with problems, actively applying, combining study and use, learning urgently needed things first, seeing immediate results, and working hard on application." Whenever we find that a team member has the seeds of individualism, we study "In Memory of Norman Bethune"; whenever we find that discipline is loose, we study "Against Libertinism"; whenever innovation experiments fail, we study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." Because study is closely combined with transforming thoughts and guiding work, everyone loves to study more and more, the more they study, the more united they become, and the more they study, the brighter their minds become.

Chairman Mao's books have become the first need in the lives of many of us. They have given us boundless strength and wisdom. Over the years, the Red and Expert Team, with Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, has emphasized politics, led production with politics, led technology with politics, and implemented more than 700 technological innovations.

The comrades in our Red and Expert Team have achieved some small successes in technological innovation, mainly because we have read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words. To continue to advance under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we have discussed and summarized the following ten points to remember:

1. Remember: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Among thousands and tens of thousands of things, Mao Zedong Thought is the first. Without the Party's leadership and Mao Zedong Thought, we will lose our direction.

2. Remember: Politics is the commander, the soul. "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Politics must command technology. To innovate technology, we must first revolutionize our thoughts.

3. Remember: "The people have limitless creative power." Organizing together, with many people and broad wisdom, the strength is great. Mobilizing people's enthusiasm will make us invincible.

4. Remember: "The law of unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe." Correctly solving the relationship between revolution and production, revolution promotes production, and increased production relies on revolution.

5. Remember: "We advocate self-reliance." Innovation relies on people's creative spirit, not emphasizing objectivity, not waiting for conditions.

6. Remember: "Overcome all difficulties to strive for victory." When facing difficulties, we must be bold, dare to struggle, and dare to win.

7. Remember: "Concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one." Grasp the key points, concentrate the main forces, and break through one by one.

8. Remember: "Correct thoughts of people only come from social practice." Technological innovation, without repeated practice, will not achieve the expected results.

9. Remember: "With discovery, invention, creation, and progress." Revolution has no end, science has no peak, innovation has no end, and every successful improvement is just a new starting point.

10. Remember: "Humility makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind." Do not be complacent with achievements, and all honors belong to the Party.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to Guide Life

A true revolutionary not only should be a revolutionary in class struggle and production struggle but also should be a revolutionary in handling personal life issues. Love, marriage, childbirth, and family relationships, not only should we solve practical problems, but more importantly, we should solve worldview problems, break with the old and establish the new, have the thought of putting revolutionary interests first and personal interests second. In this way, we can promote our female comrades' work and study, make ourselves continuously revolutionize and advance.

Soon after I entered the factory, I heard some people say about us female comrades: "They are half-revolutionaries," "once they fall in love, they slide downhill, once they get married, they are tied to the family, once they have children, they are lazy and don't go out." I heard this and was very unhappy. However, love, marriage, and childbirth are indeed practical problems that male and female youth encounter on their forward path. How to understand, how to deal with, and how to solve them, I also had no idea. So, I brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, loyal, active, putting revolutionary interests as the first life, and personal interests serving revolutionary interests..." He also said, "Some comrades do not want to think about difficulties. But difficulties are facts, and we must acknowledge as many as there are, and we cannot adopt the policy of 'not acknowledging.' We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and fight against difficulties." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I treated love, marriage, and childbirth as three problems that female comrades often encounter on the revolutionary forward path, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide life, established the thought of putting revolutionary interests first, broke with the old and established the new, solved difficulties, and advanced continuously.

The first is the love problem. We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, fighting for the cause of communism to the end, listening to the Party and Chairman Mao's words, we must use the proletarian love view to handle this problem.

After I met my husband Lu Qichang, we encountered specific problems. I often thought, Chairman Mao teaches us that youth is the most precious time, the time to grow physically, grow in knowledge, and lay the foundation. I am a Party member, putting revolutionary interests as the first life, I must not let love affect work and study. My husband is also a Party member, and he agreed with this view.

We spent four years together before marriage, rarely went to the movies together, rarely went for walks, or had heart-to-heart talks. We also had appointments, but they were often unsuccessful, often because of production and meetings, we forgot the appointments. One day, I invited him to the movies, but coincidentally, there was a critical issue in production, so I was busy improving the technology to break through the critical point, and I completely forgot about going to the movies. Lu Qichang waited at the movie theater, left and right, until the movie started, I still hadn't come, so he was anxious, rode his bicycle to my house to find me. As soon as he entered the house, he saw me making a model, so he didn't say anything and helped me make the model.

Our four-year love life was like this. However, we did not affect our feelings because we did not go for walks or talk about love, but instead, our feelings grew stronger, and we understood each other more.

We are both Party members and cannot always talk about love, walk on the street, and waste time. We should put more time into work. We both felt that our thoughts were consistent, and our struggle goals were consistent, which was more important than anything else.

The second is the marriage problem. The essence of this problem is whether a young person, after having a family, is infatuated with family life or jumps out of the small family circle and continues the revolution.

After I got married, I encountered some specific problems, such as buying grain, boiling water, cooking, mending, and patching. At this time, I had a real experience of housework and felt that female comrades were indeed more burdened. How to deal with the heavy burden? Chairman Mao teaches us that people are the decisive factor. I thought, we have played the subjective initiative of people in production and overcome various difficulties. Housework burden is the same, the key is our attitude towards it. Thinking of this, I understood that every female comrade who gets married can be said to have a housework burden. But because of the different attitudes towards this problem, there are different manifestations. Those who have personalistic thoughts in their minds, even if the housework burden is not heavy, will also relax work and study. The female Red Army soldiers during the Long March, the female Eighth Route Army soldiers during the War of Resistance, why could they persist in marching and fighting? The main reason was that they had a firm revolutionary will, a determination to revolutionize to the end, and in their minds, there were only "revolution" and no personal, family, and other private thoughts, so they had the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth, daring to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea. Compared with them, our environment today is much better. Every day we have fixed working hours, childbirth has maternity leave, kindergartens, and milk delivery time. The Party and the state have created such good conditions for us female comrades to work and study better, to get rid of "turning the stove," to be liberated, to revolutionize thoroughly. If we are not spirited, for a little housework, do not strive for progress, how can we repay the Party and Chairman Mao's care for us? I shared these thoughts with my husband, and he agreed with my views. After discussing, we made four plans:

1. To help each other, plan to study Chairman Mao's works;
2. To manage the household together, not to let housework hold us back;
3. To plan expenses, be thrifty and save, and put the surplus into the bank to support national construction;
4. To plan childbirth, revolutionize continuously, and advance continuously.

These four points have been followed by us to this day. With such a thought, through such specific arrangements, the housework burden is nothing. When there is a critical issue in production, we think of ways to innovate and make models. Sometimes, because of innovation, we forget to put lye in the steamed buns, forget to put salt in the stir-fried dishes, forget to put rice in the pot, but we are happy that we have not been tied down by the small family.

The third is the childbirth problem, specifically, not to let the children hold us back, and to work better for the revolution.

I now have two children. Before I had children, I saw some female comrades who, as soon as they got pregnant, were taken care of by the leaders in various ways, not letting them do this, not letting them do that. During my pregnancy, to prevent the leaders from finding out, I wore a loose and large coat and kept it a secret. Six months pregnant, I was still doing everything.

I am a person who is used to running around outside. After giving birth to a child, I couldn't sit still during the confinement period at home, so I went to the factory to work. The masters, workshop leaders, and comrades didn't let me work and insisted that I go back, so I had no choice but to go back.

The maternity leave was almost over, and after going to work, I still had to send milk to the child every day. I thought that sending milk would affect my work. I had done little for the Party, and if I sent milk every day, I would be even more ungrateful to the Party. So, I discussed with my husband not to send milk to the child, let the mother-in-law feed cow's milk. Before I finished speaking, the mother-in-law said, "You are strange, who doesn't feed their child with milk, you want to innovate and calculate on the child's body." Seeing the mother-in-law unhappy, I explained to her, "If I send milk, I will delay two hours a day, a year is equivalent to three months of not working, if you help, it's equivalent to you also participating in socialist construction." The mother-in-law said, "I taking care of the child is also participating in socialist construction?" I said, "Yes! We are all participating in socialist construction, just the division of labor is different. Some cook, some do manual work, some teach, and some take care of children, etc., all are building socialism, and none can be missing." The mother-in-law was happy and said, "Okay, the child eats cow's milk, like you, grows up with strength." In this way, both children were raised by the mother-in-law.

However, there were also some things that made me troubled. Especially after having two children, as soon as I returned home, the children would cling to me, I did what the children wanted, I wanted to read, the children also wanted to read, I read this book, the children snatched that book, not giving it would make them cry and make trouble.

To solve the problem of children making trouble, I paid attention to observing the children's living habits. I found that the children liked to read books with pictures, so I bought them, gradually cultivating the children's reading habits, making me get rid of the difficulties in studying. One evening, I saw that the children went to sleep earlier than usual, so I asked what happened. The mother-in-law said it was because they slept less during the day. I thought this method was good, so I discussed with the mother-in-law, from then on, let the children sleep less during the day, cultivating the habit of going to bed and getting up early. In this way, in the evening, I could study, draw, and make models without being disturbed.

From years of life practice, I felt that in the revolutionary path, just passing through love, marriage, and childbirth is not enough, and we must also handle family relationships well. If family relationships are not handled well, when returning home, there will be no heart to study and think about work problems. How to handle family relationships well? My experience is:

First, organize the whole family to study Chairman Mao's works, often recall the bitterness and sweetness, and continuously raise class awareness. We are a large family, with eight people, including grandparents, two younger sisters.

Although our family was very poor in the past, if we don't often recall the bitterness and sweetness, we will forget the past bitterness. Once, the mother-in-law said to me, "Fengying, during the day, I take the children to the meeting, other people's children are dressed neatly, but our children are not as good as others, I am afraid people will laugh at us." I said, "Mom, you said before, Qichang was ten years old and still had no shoes to wear, now life is better, we must not forget the past. I am not stingy with money. I mean we should not spoil the children, not indulge the children, not give the children whatever they want. As long as they are not hungry or cold, it's fine. Dressing well has only disadvantages and no advantages. Now our life is better, but we must not forget the past." I said this, and the mother-in-law smiled and didn't say anything more.

Second, often find contradictions, analyze contradictions, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. One day, after dinner, I cleaned up the dishes and was about to go out to participate in a technical cooperation meeting, telling Mom, I'm leaving. The mother-in-law said, "Fengying, you are still leaving?" I said, "Ah." The mother-in-law didn't say anything, but I thought, why didn't she say that before? Today, why say "still" leaving? I thought about it and thought about it, and I thought of the mother-in-law's body was not good, and her age was also big, if the children made trouble, I might do less work. The next day, I sought my husband's opinion, and he thought the same as me. Afterwards, I paid attention to it, and I rushed to do the housework, trying to reduce the burden on the elderly.

Third, at home, also like outside, should be selfless, caring for others is more important than caring for oneself. Revolutionary comrades should also have revolutionary families, should care for each other from a revolutionary, proletarian perspective, from a political and living perspective, making the elderly feel the superiority of the new society in our care, feel that we young people, under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, possess new morality and new customs.

From years of practical life, I felt that love, marriage, and family problems are not just the affairs of husband and wife, but are closely related to socialist construction. Husband and wife have good feelings, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have good relationships, sister-in-law relationships are good, first of all, they must be good politically, must first be revolutionary comrades, put "revolution" first, then husband and wife, sister-in-law relationships. Only by handling these well, can we have a happy mood, full spirit, study well, work well, and wholeheartedly do revolutionary work.

Over the years, through continuous study of Chairman Mao's works, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's thoughts are rich and endless. To better use Mao Zedong Thought to guide my actions, I often summarize some of Chairman Mao's viewpoints according to my thoughts and work situations, as a guideline for my thoughts and actions. When encountering problems, I think about what Chairman Mao said about this problem and what I should do, thus having a clear direction. These viewpoints I summarize them into ten "think about it," which are:

In the face of major issues, think about it: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend?"

When personal interests and collective interests conflict, think about it: "Serve the people wholeheartedly."

When discipline is loose, think about it: "Against Libertinism."

When receiving criticism, think about it: "If there is, change it; if there isn't, be more diligent."

When achieving results, think about it: "Humility makes one progress, and arrogance makes one fall behind."

When encountering difficulties, think about it: "Overcome all difficulties to strive for victory."

When there is no way to work, think about it: "Three cobblers with their wits combined make a Zhuge Liang."

When encountering setbacks and failures, think about it: "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Carry the Revolution Through to the End."

When seeing others in difficulty, think about it: "Selflessly for others."

When helping backward comrades, think about it: "Divide into two."

Recently, Comrade Lin Biao called for pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, seriously and diligently study Chairman Mao's works, study a sentence and use a sentence, study every day and use every day, study for a lifetime and use for a lifetime, making our factory, making our country a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Not only must we study and use it well in our lifetime, but we must also educate our descendants to study and use it well. We must pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, making our descendants forever revolutionize and forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!

    我要永远革命，永远忠于毛泽东思想
    东北机器制造厂工人工程师尉凤英在首都革命群众大会上的报告（摘要）
    我这次来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京，来到伟大领袖毛主席的身边，看到了毛主席身体非常健康，满面红光，这是我们最大的愉快，也是我们最大的幸福。我在这里祝我们伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    我这次来是背着口袋来的，是向首都革命人民、革命师生、红卫兵小将们学习的，要把你们学习、执行、宣传、捍卫和忠于毛泽东思想的经验学到手，背回去，传下去，开花、结果。
    我向大家汇报一下学习毛主席著作的情况。
    用毛泽东思想  不断改造自己
    改造思想，树立无产阶级世界观，我觉得最主要的就是用毛泽东思想武装自己，破私立公，破旧立新，也就是要破资产阶级思想，立毛泽东思想。
    我虽然出身在一个工人家庭里，但是在我没有读毛主席的书，脑子里没有毛泽东思想以前，自己也受了不少资产阶级思想的影响。因此，出身好同样也要进行思想改造。
    解放前，我爷爷是个瓦工，爸爸在抚顺煤矿做工，一天累死累活，还是吃不饱穿不暖。我三岁那年，爸爸累得患了重病，没有钱治，眼睁睁地看着他活活折磨死了。爸爸死后，一家人没吃的，只好把十四岁的大哥，送到一家工厂做工。大哥经常被老板、工头打得鼻青脸肿。母亲给人家做零活，缝破烂，起早贪黑，忙到半夜，也糊不上口，吃了这顿，没那顿，没办法，我只好跟妈妈去讨饭。我整天光着脚，拣煤核，挖野菜。有一次上山拾柴禾，饿得发慌，背着一捆柴，摇摇晃晃地，一阵大风，刮得我连人带柴从半山坡上滚了下来，被摔得满身血汁糊拉的。回到家，妈妈都吓呆了，叫了一声：“苦命的孩子！”抱着我大哭一场。就这样，我在旧社会的苦水里泡了十五年。想想旧社会的苦，比比新社会的甜，就更加热爱我们伟大的党，热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。
    我就带着这样的阶级感情，一九五三年进了工厂。入厂后，我恨不得把浑身的劲都使出来。领导叫我干啥我就干啥，服从分配，起早贪黑，天不怕，地不怕，就是一个劲地干。但是，由于我脑子里还没有毛泽东思想，还没有树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，因此经不起资产阶级思想的侵袭。我的思想曾不断地出岔子。我学的是冲压工，专门性很强，技术比较简单。当时，和我一起入厂的人，有的学画图，有的学车工。在个别人中间流传着一种不正确的说法：“车、钳、铣，没有比，冲、铆、焊，凑合干，叫翻砂，就回家。”我想，冲压这一行，虽然比翻砂好一些，但总不如别人学车工和铣工好。这一想，对工作就不大安心了，回家想说说，怕哥哥批评，想和老师傅说，又怕老师傅说我不好。不说心里是个事。在这种思想支配下，有空我就到孔照斌老师傅的车床上去看，越看越想学车工好。工长看透了我的心事，就找我谈话，对我说：“不要站在这山望那山高。要想一想在旧社会我们工人干活是为了养活老婆孩子，没有技术吃不开，就是有点技术也是白为资本家卖命。在新社会就不同了，不论干什么工作都是为人民服务，干哪一行都是为了革命，缺哪一行也是不行，都是建设社会主义，都是党的需要。”我想，领导上说的对呀！我还没给党做什么工作呢，就挑起工作来了，这对吗？打这以后，就不乱串了，对自己的工作也安心了。
    过了不长时间，有一天，我上班穿了一件白衬衫，头也梳得光光的。干活时怕把衣服弄脏了，就没有往常那股泼辣劲了。工长汤世桢看我和往常打扮的不一样，就找我谈话，问我今天为什么穿得这么好，把我问得脸红脖子粗。我就向工长说了心里话。同宿舍里有些女同志嫌我脏，身上有油泥味，成天摆弄黄泥做模型，不像大姑娘样子，活像个傻小子，疯丫头，不知收拾利利索索的。我听到这些话，感到人家说得对，现在上班了，应该拾掇得像个姑娘的样子，从而就换上了新衣服。没有头油，就用榆树皮泡的水往头上抹。当时，工长给我指出：不是你穿件新衣服不对，上班干活为什么换新衣服，这里有一个追求什么的问题。身上有油味并不可怕，怕的是我们思想不干净。你今天穿上件新衣服，抹榆树皮水，明天就可能想穿更好的，就可能抹头油，干起活来怕这怕那的了，这样发展下去是很危险的。
    从这两件事情说明，一个人在没有用毛泽东思想武装自己，没有树立起无产阶级世界观以前，即使出身好的人，也是经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀的。
    我读毛主席的书，是从一九五四年开始的。有一天，支部书记和我谈话，问我：“凤英，你为什么早来晚走，干得这么起劲？”我张口就说：“为了报答党的恩情！”支部书记又问：“报答完了党的恩情又怎么办？”我想了很长时间也没有回答上来。接着支书就耐心地对我说：“我们进工厂工作，不光是为了报答党的恩情。光知道报恩是不够的，更重要的是全心全意为人民服务，是干革命。”他给我讲了一些有关树立革命世界观的道理，并送给我几本毛主席著作单行本，叫我回去好好看看，仔细想一想，今后如何工作。
    下班回到宿舍以后，我把那几本书看了一遍又一遍，越想越觉得党支书说的话对。不树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，就会为个人打算。我联想到了我不安心干专门活，不就是为了个人打算吗？从个人利益出发的人，在个人利益和党的利益发生矛盾的时候，就不能自觉地服从党的利益。想到这里，我大吃一惊，明白了光有报恩思想，不树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，就不能做好工作。我虽然初步找到了不安心工作的根子，但是还不懂得只有彻底改造思想，才能从根本上解决这个问题。所以，就订了三条计划：一不闹工种，二不闹工资，三不闹奖励。我感到做好这三条就叫全心全意为人民服务了。这实际上是低标准的。
    那时我哥哥有一至三卷《毛泽东选集》，我就翻着看，觉得毛主席的话句句都说到我心眼里，越看越爱看。但是，在当时，还认识不到用毛主席的书指导自己的行动，谈不到活学活用，更没有把它当成最高指示，只知道毛主席的话说得对，一定要听毛主席的话。这样碰到一些问题，也就不自觉地按照毛主席的教导去做了。在做的中间，尝到了一些甜头，于是对学习毛主席著作的重要意义逐渐有了一些认识，学习的劲头也就更大了。开始因为我自己没有《毛泽东选集》，就把哥哥的《毛泽东选集》拿来看，并把一些重要文章抄下来，大约抄了五万多字。到了一九五九年，全国群英会发给每个代表一套《毛泽东选集》。我想，这是党中央向我们发出的伟大号召，要我们带头搞好生产和工作，更要带头读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，走革命化的道路。打这以后，我对学习毛主席著作就比较自觉一些了。不管工作多么忙，睡觉多么晚，每天都要抽时间学习一段，不学习就像少了什么似的，也开始带着自己碰到的一些问题学了。
    一九六三年三月，毛主席发出了“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，使我认识到，雷锋同志能够成为伟大的共产主义战士，最根本的是用毛泽东思想武装了头脑。我就以雷锋为榜样，找出五条差距，头一条就是对学习毛主席著作认识不足，没有像雷锋那样，把毛主席的书当作空气、粮食和方向盘，没有像雷锋那样用毛泽东思想改造自己，指导自己行动。打这开始，我就不是每天回家学一段，而是想办法挤时间去学。上班走路需要十几分钟，我就在手上写一条语录，一边走一边学；走到了车间，也把这条语录记下来了。开会之前，人还没有到齐，我就利用这个时间也学一段。住疗养院早上别人还没起床，我就把头伸到窗外学习。晚上别人睡觉了，我就在走廊里看一看毛主席的书。外出开会，在车站等车，在汽车上、火车上，都是学习的好机会。这时，我深深感到，毛主席著作是我们的精神上的粮食，是我们工作的动力，一时不学就没有方向，没有力量。于是越学越有劲，越学眼睛越亮，越学革命劲头越足。
    通过不断学习，使我体会到，要彻底改造思想，就要自觉地用毛泽东思想不断同“我”字作斗争，活一辈子就要同“我”字斗一辈子。
    一九五六年工厂实行工资考试晋级，和我一起来的青年工人，都在作考试的准备。当时我正在和大家一起研究一项技术改进。车间领导和老师傅，怕影响我晋级考试，三番五次地劝我把革新放一放，等考试完了再搞。我想，考试晋级是个人的事，搞革新是为了提高生产，是为了革命。想到这里，我就决定继续搞试验。考试那天，同志们又来劝我参加，你一言，他一语，说得我心活了，拾掇拾掇就走了。没走多远，越想越不对劲。毛主席明明教导我们，个人利益要无条件地服从党的利益，把革命利益放在第一位，而我放下革新不搞，去参加晋级考试，不正是把个人利益放在前头，违背了毛主席的教导吗？！搞革新，就是干革命，干革命就要干到底。于是我转身又回来了。事后我感到，我没有参加考试，比别人少晋了一级，但我感到我听了毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想指导了自己的行动，反而觉得自己做对了，心里很愉快。
    有一次小组评奖，有个别同志为了多得奖金，争得脸红脖子粗。我看到这种情况，就联想到毛主席的教导，我们是为人民利益工作的。为人民利益工作，人民已经给了我们报酬，再要奖金，就是多余的了。伸手去争不对，就是不争，给了就要，也不好。想到这里，我就下决心坚决不再要革新奖了。于是就把几年来国家给我的几百元革新奖金，一部分给大家买了毛主席著作，一部分给红专大队做活动基金。
    有一次我到兄弟厂参观，看到他们还有些地方是手工操作，就觉得没啥可学的。晚上，在回忆一天情况时，感到收获不大。我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。”毛主席又说：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”我把这些话反复读了好几遍，越读越感到毛主席是在说我呢，心里热呼呼的，脸上一阵发烧，一夜也没有睡好觉。这时我认识了“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。不从零作起，就会使自己停止不前。于是第二天，我就向支部作了检讨。
    菜刀用完不擦要生锈，会越锈越厚；人的思想不改造也会生锈，也是越锈越厚，直到变质。毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”思想的敌人也是同样。对待思想的敌人，必须用毛泽东思想这一最强大的武器，狠狠地打，才能把它打倒。我还感到，思想的敌人，又不同于拿枪的敌人。拿枪的敌人，打死一个就少一个；思想的敌人就不同，今天在这里把它打倒了，明天又会在那里冒出来。所以必须经常地打，时时刻刻地打，而且不能就事论事地打，必须要剿它的老窝。要想做到这一点，没有别的窍门，只有老老实实地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，彻底树立无产阶级的世界观。
    听毛主席的话，念念不忘阶级斗争
    毛主席一再教导我们：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在革命实践中，使我深刻认识到，在社会主义社会里，仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争，这种斗争是尖锐复杂的。阶级敌人时刻企图在中国复辟。
    在我初入厂的时候，我跟汪蔚文学徒。汪蔚文说话、行动，处处老是同其他师傅不一样。有空我去帮别的师傅干点活，他都不高兴，说我是狗抓耗子多管闲事。有一天，我看他做的活里头有废品，就把它挑出来单搁着。他见了不高兴地说：“你闲着没事了，挑它干什么？”我说：“这都是废的。”他眼一瞪说：“说你缺心眼就是缺心眼嘛，放进去不也顶数吗？”我接着说：“那怎么行呢，这不是胡弄人吗？”“胡弄不胡弄的，也碍不着你的事。”说着又把废品掺了进去。我照例把它挑出来。我看了这些，觉得他不是真正的国家主人，不像个工人样子，就及时向支部汇报他的这些活动情况。支部书记告诉我说：“你能及时反映情况，这很好。”并且要我提高警惕，注意他的活动。后来在伟大的肃反运动中，在我们职工的检举揭发下，经过组织详细调查，原来汪蔚文是钻进我们工人阶级队伍里的历史反革命分子。人民政府把他依法逮捕了。这个活生生的事实，给了我一次深刻的教育，使我亲身体验到，拿枪的敌人被我们打倒了，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们还设法混入到企业内部和工人队伍中来。我们必须时刻提高警惕，才能在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，看得清，站得稳，顶得住，自觉地积极主动地向阶级敌人进行坚决斗争。
    在生产斗争和科学实验中，同样，也有激烈的阶级斗争。一九五六年，我们小组生产很紧张，我那道工序忙得很厉害。为了改变这种被动局面，经过反复琢磨，发现上下道工序加工方法基本一样，要是把两道工序合在一起，就可以减少不少的时间。老师傅们也都说这个办法行，在车间领导支持和技术组的帮助下，经多次试验，终于合并成功了，并且使手工打毛刺工序成了半机械化，既节约了人力设备，又提高了生产效率。我和同志们都很高兴。可是，我们请厂部技术部门批示改工艺的时候，专责工程师却不同意，他摇摇脑袋说：“不行，这是苏联资料，不能随便改。”我们磨破了嘴皮讲道理，他还是一口咬定不行，简直把我们气坏了。毛主席教导我们，事物总是不断发展变化的，为啥他死抱着苏联资料不放呢？就不相信我们工人的，就相信书本上的，我们非常气愤。他不同意，我找厂长去解决，把这情况向领导做了汇报。第二天他们顶着大雨来到车间，亲自看了我们的试验，同意了我们的改进。这时那位工程师才被迫低头，不吭声了。
    我深深体会到，要革命就要斗争。不仅要同生产技术上的困难斗，更要敢于同旧的习惯势力和保守思想斗，同资产阶级技术“权威”斗，同束缚群众手脚的洋框框洋教条斗。只有不断斗争，不断取得新的胜利，我们的革命事业才能不断向前发展。
    阶级斗争是长期的，复杂的，有时是很激烈的。一九五七年，沈阳市的资产阶级右派分子高风以帮助党整风为名，公开诬蔑社会主义建设高潮是“高草”，攻击党的领导，挑拨党群之间的关系。后来他见势不妙，就跑到我们厂他女儿家里“避风”。我们听说后，非常气愤。我和青年一齐登门，质问高风，把他问得上言不接下语，脸上掉下豆大的汗珠子，像个霜打的茄子一样，低头认了罪。这时，我们车间的右派分子陈静，也在大肆攻击党的领导。我们又同他展开了面对面的斗争，大家严厉批驳了他的谬论，斗倒了陈静。
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在全国工农兵群众的声讨下，资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻是被打下去了，但是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争并没有结束。一九六四年批判杨献珍、冯定，就是这种斗争的继续。杨献珍抛出了合二而一的谬论，公然同毛主席的一分为二的观点相对抗。说什么剥削阶级和被剥削阶级可以合二而一，资产阶级和无产阶级可以合二而一，可以和平共处，可以不要斗争，这通通是胡说八道。看到这些我肺都要气炸了。这使我想起了我的一家在旧社会的遭遇。我家祖孙三代在资本家的皮鞭下，哪有我们工人的活路。我父亲就是活生生地被资本家给折磨死的。是党和毛主席领导我们翻了身，使我们这些在旧社会给资本家当牛当马的人做了国家的主人。但是资产阶级不甘心失败，千方百计搞复辟活动，想翻天，我们工人坚决同他们斗。但是杨献珍却宣扬什么合二而一，取消阶级斗争，这明明是在替资产阶级说话，是在为资产阶级复辟搞宣传。想到这里，我再也忍耐不住了。绝对不能让他们的阴谋得逞。我怀着阶级仇恨的怒火，用我拿锤子的手拿起笔杆，写了批判文章。我以毛主席一分为二的观点为武器，以我亲身的经历和我们红专大队的生动事实，批驳了杨献珍的反动谬论，揭穿了他们的反动阴谋。当时，我想，我的文化程度低，而杨献珍又是什么“权威”，感到有点难。但当我想起，这是一场严重的阶级斗争，这是关系到保卫无产阶级专政的大事，关系到保卫毛泽东思想的大事时，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫党和毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想的责任感，促使我什么也不难了，什么也不怕了，什么“权威”通通都不在话下了。我除了写批判杨献珍的文章外，还写了批判冯定的反动资产阶级观点的文章。
    通过斗杨献珍，斗冯定，使我亲眼看到，一切资产阶级“权威”，在伟大的毛泽东思想面前，在用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众面前，通通都是纸老虎，不管他的名声多大，“威望”多高，通通都可以斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，使他们永世不得翻身。
    当前，一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在全国胜利地发展，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，揪出了一小撮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的右派分子。这些钻进党内来的资产阶级右派分子，他们恶毒地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，他们的目的是要在中国搞资本主义复辟。这是绝对办不到的，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！谁要是反对我们伟大领袖毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，我们工农兵群众豁出命来也要跟他拚到底！
    从我亲身的经历中，使我深深地体会到，我们革命人民的骨肉是跟党、跟毛主席连在一起的，没有共产党和毛主席，就没有我们的一切。大海航行靠舵手，毛主席就是我们中国革命和世界革命的伟大舵手；万物生长靠太阳，毛主席就是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想就是我们革命的命根子。敌人越是反对毛泽东思想，害怕毛泽东思想，我们工农兵群众就越是热爱毛泽东思想，越是要刻苦地学习毛泽东思想。特别要在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中活学活用，在斗争中学，斗争中用，掌握好毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，同阶级敌人斗争，直到把那些走资本主义道路的当权派，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭为止，使他们永世不得翻身！
    以毛泽东思想为指针，大闹技术革新
    搞技术革新，我感到最重要的是要在党的领导下，以毛泽东思想为指针。要有为革命搞革新的思想，不断和各种错误思想作斗争；要有革命精神，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命，反复实践，不怕失败，不断革命；要紧紧依靠集体，依靠群众，群策群力闹革新。
    一九五三年，我入厂才四个月，独立操作实在感到困难。那时车间的生产任务很重。我因为技术不熟练，天天完不成生产进度，就早来晚走，加班加点，拚命地干，还是不解决问题。心里真着急，越急越加大吃刀量。吃刀量已经很大了，还觉得很慢，弄来弄去，把刀打啦。这回生产效率更低了，气得我哭了。在旁边干活的李玉书老师傅走过来劝我，并指出我干活效率低主要有两个原因：一是卡活慢，一是从铝沫里挑活费时间。他让我在这两个问题上，动脑筋，找窍门，不要一个劲拚体力。
    我按照李师傅的指点，整天琢磨着怎样才能卡活快，怎样才能把铝沫和零件自动分开，在工厂想，在宿舍想，走在路上也想。后来，看到食堂门弓子可以使门自动关上，建筑工人筛砂子，使石子砂子分离。在这两个事的启发下，我一想有门，就找李玉书、宋殿武两位老师傅商量。在他们的具体帮助下，搞成了半自动扳柄和自动分料器。这两项革新实现以后，提高生产效率百分之八十，提前一百一十八天完成了全年生产任务。我想“窍门”这玩艺儿威力可真大呀！以前起五更爬半夜还完不成任务，找了“窍门”一下子就解决了，为抗美援朝多出一把力，真是一个好“法宝”，今后还得走这条道。
    第一次搞革新尝到了甜头，以后我就老琢磨着找“窍门”。看看这台机床，摸摸那台设备，发现哪儿有点毛病总想把它改一改。由于党的领导和老师傅的帮助，从一九五三年到一九五七年，实现了一百七十多项革新项目。
    毛主席教导我们说：“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”，我觉得对呀！一个人闹革新是单枪匹马，组织起来力量大，一个人多生产一百个产品，也仅仅是一百个，一百个人每人多生产十个就是一千个，这力量多大呀！只有组织起来，才能充分发挥集体的智慧，才能加速社会主义建设。
    我把这个想法向党支部汇报了。党支部支持我的意见。当我和老师傅商量的时候，有一位老师傅悄悄对我说：“凤英，您想过没有？论文化，年青人都比你高，论技术，老师傅都比你强，组织起来搞革新，将来有了成绩算谁的？明年你拿什么成绩去开劳模会呢？”我说：当不当劳模是小事，只要对党的事业有利，就应该去做，共产党员遇事不能先替个人打算。经我这么一解释，那位老师傅也就同意了。一九五八年三月六日，由车工冯希良，冲压工梁宝清和我三个人成立了一个业余技术革新小组。这个小组一成立，立刻显示了组织起来的好处。不久，便由一个小组发展成三个小组，后来又改为业余技术革新红专大队。
    为了使大家有一个统一的思想，就是用毛泽东思想统帅红专大队的一切活动，红专大队中建立了学习毛主席著作的制度。几年来，我们学习毛主席著作，一直按照“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫”的原则去作的。每当发现队员有个人主义思想苗头，就学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》，发现有纪律松散的苗头，就学《反对自由主义》，每当革新试验失败的时候，就学《愚公移山》《将革命进行到底》。因为学习同改造思想、指导工作结合得紧，大家越学越爱学，越学人心越齐，越学心里越亮。
    毛主席的书已经成为我们许多人生活的第一需要。它给了我们无穷的力量和智慧。几年来，红专大队以毛泽东思想挂帅，突出政治，以政治带生产，以政治带技术，实现了七百多项技术革新。
    我们红专大队的同志们在技术革新上所以能取得一点微小的成绩，主要的是读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话。为了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗继续前进，我们经过大家的反复讨论，总结了这样十个牢记：
    一、牢记：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。千条、万条，毛泽东思想是第一条。离开了党的领导和毛泽东思想就会迷失方向。
    二、牢记：政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”政治必须统帅技术，要技术革新必须先思想革命。
    三、牢记：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”组织起来人多智广力量大，调动了人的积极因素，就无往而不胜。
    四、牢记：“对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。”正确解决革命和生产的关系，革命促生产，增产靠革命。
    五、牢记：“我们是主张自力更生的。”搞革新靠人的创造精神，不强调客观，不等待条件。
    六、牢记：“排除万难，去争取胜利。”对待困难要“闯”字当头，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。
    七、牢记：“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”。抓住关键，集中主要力量，各个突破。
    八、牢记：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来”。技术革新不经过反复实践，就得不到预想的结果。
    九、牢记：“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”革命无尽头，科学无顶点，革新无止境，每项改进的成功只是新的起点。
    十、牢记：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。取得成绩不自满，一切荣誉归于党。
    用毛泽东思想统帅生活
    一个真正的革命战士，不仅在阶级斗争、生产斗争中应该是革命派，在处理个人生活问题上也应该是革命派。恋爱、结婚、生孩子、家庭关系等生活问题，不仅要解决实际问题，更主要的是解决世界观问题，要破私立公，破旧立新，要有革命利益第一，个人利益服从革命利益的思想。这样，就能促进我们女同志的工作和学习，使自己不断革命，不断前进。
    我入厂不久，就听到有些人说我们女同志：“是半截革命者”，“一恋爱下坡快，结了婚事缠身，生了孩子懒出门。”我听了很不服气。可是恋爱、结婚、生孩子，确实是男女青年在前进道路上的实际问题。到底怎样认识，怎样对待，怎样解决，我心里也没个底。于是我就带着这个问题，学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益……。”又说：“有些同志不愿意多想困难。但是困难是事实，有多少就得承认多少，不能采取‘不承认主义’。我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争。”我按照毛主席的教导，把恋爱、结婚、生孩子三个问题，当作女同志在革命前进的道路上经常要遇到的三个问题，用毛泽东思想统帅生活，树立革命利益第一思想，破旧立新，解决困难，不断前进。
    第一是恋爱问题。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，要为共产主义事业奋斗到底，要听党和毛主席的话，就必须用无产阶级的恋爱观来处理这个问题。
    我和我爱人卢其昌认识以后，碰到了具体问题。我经常想，毛主席教导我们，青年时代是最宝贵的，是长身体，长知识，打基础的时期，我是一个党员，以革命利益为第一生命，决不能因为恋爱影响工作和学习。我爱人是一个党员，他非常同意这种看法。
    我们在婚前相处四年，很少在一起看电影，很少在一起散步，谈心。我们也曾约会过，总是十约九不成，常常因为生产和开会就把约会忘了。有一天我约他看电影，恰巧生产上又出了关键，我只忙于改进技术突破关键，早把看电影的事扔到脑后去了。卢其昌同志在电影院门前左等右等，等到电影都开演了我还没去，他急了，骑上自行车到我家去找我。他一进屋，看我正在做模型，就没有说什么，帮我做起模型来了。
    我俩四年来的恋爱生活，就是这样度过的。但是，我们并没有因为不在一起压马路，谈情说爱，而影响我们的感情，相反地更加增长了我们之间的感情，促进了我们之间的了解。
    我们都是党员，不能老谈情说爱压马路，白白浪费时间，应把更多的时间用到工作中去。我们共同感到，我们的思想是一致的，奋斗目标是一致的，这一点比别的什么都重要。
    第二是结婚问题。这个问题的实质，是一个青年人有了家庭以后，是迷恋于家庭生活，还是跳出小家庭圈子，继续革命。
  我结婚以后，碰到了一些具体问题，像买粮，烧水做饭，缝缝补补等。这时我对家务事才有了实际体会，感到女同志就是比男同志负担重。负担重怎么办？毛主席教导我们，人是决定因素。我想，我们在生产上发挥了人的主观能动性，就战胜了种种困难，家务负担也是一样，关键在我们用什么态度来对待。想到这里我明白了，结了婚的女同志可以说每个人都有家务负担。但由于每个人对待这个问题的态度不同，就有不同表现。满脑袋装着个人主义思想的人，就是家庭负担不重，也是放松了工作和学习的。长征时的女红军，抗战时的女八路，她们为什么能坚持行军打仗呢？主要的是她们有坚强的革命意志，有革命到底的决心，思想上只有“革命”二字，根本没有个人家庭等私心杂念，所以她们就有天不怕，地不怕，敢于上刀山，下火海的革命精神。相比之下，我们今天的环境比她们好得多，每天有固定的工作时间，生孩子有产假，有托儿所和送奶的时间。党和国家给我们创造了这样好的条件，就是让我们女同志更好的工作和学习，让我们摆脱“锅台转”，得到解放，彻底革命，我们要是再不争气，为一点家务事，就不求上进，怎么能对得起党和毛主席对我们的关怀呢？我把这些想法和我爱人说了，他很同意我的看法。我们经过商量，订了四条计划：
    一、要互相帮助，有计划地学习毛主席著作；
    二、要共同管好家务，不让家务事拖住后腿；
    三、要计划开支，勤俭节约，把节余的钱送进银行，支援国家建设；
    四、要计划生育，不断革命，不断前进。
    这四条到现在我们一直坚持执行。有了这样的思想认识，通过这样的具体安排，家务负担算不了什么。生产有了关键，就想办法搞革新，做模型。有时由于想革新，蒸馒头忘了放碱，炒菜忘了放盐，做饭忘了下米，但是我们高兴的是，我们没有被小家庭缠住后腿。
    第三是生孩子问题，具体的说就是不让小孩拖住后腿，更好地为革命工作。
    我现在已有两个小孩啦。在我没有生孩子以前，看到有的女同志一怀孕，领导千方百计地照顾，不让干这，不让干那。我在怀孕期间，为了不让领导发现，就做了一件又肥又大的衣服，严格保密。怀孕六个月，还是什么活都干。
    我是在外面跑惯了的人。生了小孩以后，在家坐月子期间，实在呆不住，就进厂去干活。老师傅、车间领导和同志们不让我干，非叫我回去不可，没办法我就回去了。
    产假快满了，上班后每天还要给小孩送奶。我想送奶就要影响工作。我本来为党作的工作就不多，再天天送奶，就更对不起党了。我就和爱人商量，不给孩子送奶，让婆母喂牛奶。还没等我说完，婆母就说：“你这个人也怪，哪有有奶不给孩子吃的，你想革新也不能在孩子身上打算盘。”我看婆母不高兴，就给她算了一笔细账。我说：“我要是送奶一天就得耽误二小时，一年就等于三个月没有上班，你老要是帮帮忙，就等于你老也参加了社会主义建设。”婆母说：“我带孩子也算参加社会主义建设吗？”我说：“是呀！我们都在参加社会主义建设，只是分工不同罢了。有的烧水做饭，有的人做工种地，有的人教书带孩子等等，都是建设社会主义，缺了哪一行也不行。”婆母听后高兴的说：“行，孩子吃牛奶，像你一样，长大有牛劲。”就这样，两个孩子都是婆母给喂大的。
      但是也有些事使我苦恼过。特别是有两个孩子以后，一回到家孩子就把我缠住了，我干什么孩子要什么，我要看书，孩子也要看书，我看那本，孩子就抢那本，不给就又哭又闹。
    为了解决孩子闹的问题，我就注意观察孩子的生活习惯。发现孩子愿意看有人带画的书，我就给他买，慢慢培养了孩子看书的习惯，使我摆脱了学习上的困难。有一天晚上，我看孩子比往常睡得早，我就问是怎么回事。婆母说是中午睡觉睡少了。我想这个办法好，我就和婆母商量，以后就让孩子白天少睡点觉，培养他们早睡早起的习惯。这样，晚上我学习，画图，做模型，就不受影响了。
    从几年来的生活实践使我体会到：在革命道路上，光闯过恋爱、结婚、生孩子这三个方面，还不够，还必须搞好家庭关系。家庭关系搞不好，回到家里就没有心思去学习和考虑工作问题了。怎样搞好家庭关系呢？我的体会是：
    首先要组织全家学习毛主席著作，经常忆苦思甜，不断提高阶级觉悟。我们是一个大家庭，共有八口人，有公公婆婆，两个小姑子。
    我们家虽然过去很苦，但不经常忆苦思甜，就要忘记过去苦。有一次，婆母和我说：“凤英，白天我领孩子去开会，人家孩子都穿的利利索索的，咱孩子穿的不如人家，我都怕人家笑话。”我说：“妈，你不是说过，其昌十来岁还没有鞋穿，现在生活好了可不能忘了过去。我不是舍不得花钱。我是说咱不能惯小孩，不能任小孩性，不要小孩要什么就给什么。只要饿不着冻不着就行了。穿戴好了，只有坏处没有好处。现在咱们生活好了，可不能忘记过去。”我这么一说，婆母笑了，再也不说什么了。
    其次是经常找矛盾，分析矛盾，开展批评与自我批评。有一天，我吃完晚饭，把碗筷收拾完，刚要出门参加技术协作会，告诉妈，我走了。婆母说：“凤英，你还走啊？”我说：“啊。”婆母虽然没有说什么，但我边走边想：过去为什么没有这个“还”字呢？今天为什么说“还”走呢？我想来想去，想到婆母身体不好，年纪也大了，孩子再闹，可能我活干少了。第二天我征求爱人的意见，他说的和我想的一样。以后我就注意了，对家里的活我就抢着去干，尽量减轻老人的负担。
    再次，在家也要像在外一样，要先人后己，关心他人比关心自己为重。有革命的同志，也要有革命的家庭，要从革命，从无产阶级的感情上去关心，从政治上和生活上去关心，使老人能从我们的关怀中体会到新社会的优越，体会到我们青年在党和毛主席的教育下，所具有的新道德，新风尚。
    从多年来的实践生活中我体会到：恋爱、结婚和家庭问题，不只是夫妻双方的事情，它是和社会主义建设有密切联系的。夫妻感情好，婆媳关系好，姑嫂关系好，首先必须从政治上好，必须首先是革命同志，把“革命”二字放在第一位，然后才是夫妻，姑嫂关系。只有搞好这些，才能使我们心情舒畅，精神饱满，学习好，生产好，一心搞好革命工作。
    十几年来，通过不断学习毛主席著作，我深深体会到，毛主席思想丰富极了，真是取不尽用不完。为了更好地用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动，我结合自己的思想和工作情况，经常牢记一些毛主席的观点，作为自己思想行动的指针。碰到问题的时候，就想想毛主席在这个问题上是怎样说的，我应该怎么办，这样就有了明确的方向。这些观点我把它归纳为十个想一想，就是：
    在大是大非面前，要想一想：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友”。
    个人利益和集体利益发生矛盾的时候，要想一想：“全心全意地为人民服务”。
    纪律涣散的时候，要想一想：《反对自由主义》。
    受到批评的时候，要想一想：“有则改之，无则加勉”。
    有了成绩的时候，要想一想：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。
    遇到困难的时候，要想一想：“排除万难，去争取胜利”。
    工作没办法的时候，要想一想：“三个臭皮匠，合成一个诸葛亮”。
    碰到挫折和失败的时候，要想一想：《愚公移山》、《将革命进行到底》。
    见到别人有困难的时候，要想一想：“毫不利己专门利人”。
    帮助后进同志的时候，要想一想：“一分为二”。
    最近林彪同志号召，把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段。我们一定要坚决响应林彪同志的伟大号召，认真地、刻苦地学习毛主席著作，要学一句，用一句，天天学，天天用，学一辈子，用一辈子，把我们工厂，把我们全国都办成毛泽东思想的大学校，不但我们这一辈子要学好，用好，而且要教育我们的子孙后代，也要学好用好。一定要把毛泽东思想一代一代地传下去，让我们的子孙后代永远革命，永远忠于毛泽东思想！
