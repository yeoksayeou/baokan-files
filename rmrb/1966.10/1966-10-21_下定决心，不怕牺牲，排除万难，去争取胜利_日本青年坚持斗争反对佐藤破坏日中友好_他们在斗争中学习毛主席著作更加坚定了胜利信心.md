Japanese youth persist in their struggle against Sato's sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendship. Their study of Chairman Mao's works in the course of the struggle has further strengthened their confidence in victory.

	NEW DELHI, Oct. 19 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of Japanese youth from various parts of the country have continued their struggle in recent days, protesting against the Sato government's refusal to issue visas for their visit to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. Japanese youth are studying Chairman Mao's works while struggling, which has further strengthened their confidence in the struggle.

	Japanese youth representatives held a conference of representatives from various prefectures in Tokyo on Oct. 16. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the appeal issued by 32 Japanese figures on Sept. 26 to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and supporting the joint statement signed by the Japan-China Friendship Association delegation and the China-Japan Friendship Association delegation in Beijing on Oct. 12. The representatives also decided to struggle against all domestic and foreign forces that sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship and to struggle for further promotion of exchanges between the peoples of the two countries and cultural and economic exchanges.

	In Tokyo, since the establishment of the Tokyo Struggle Committee by the delegation members on Oct. 4, the members have divided into six groups and continued their protests against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' refusal to issue visas.

	On Oct. 10, when Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, who attended the United Nations General Assembly, returned to Tokyo, 80 delegation members gathered at Haneda Airport to protest against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' unreasonable decision to refuse to issue visas for the visit to China. Despite police obstruction, the delegation members gathered in front of the VIP room where Shiina was scheduled to hold a press conference, holding up banners with slogans such as "Oppose anti-China," "Long live the friendship and unity of the peoples of China and Japan," and "Government immediately issue visas." Shiina was forced to meet the press by the plane and then secretly left the airport.

	Youth representatives in various places have also actively carried out activities. In Yamagata, Niigata, Aichi, Kumamoto, and other prefectures, they distributed leaflets to workers and citizens, reporting on the situation of the struggle and calling on them to support the struggle.

	Delegation members in various places have carried out creative propaganda activities and enthusiastic study activities. Representatives from Yamaguchi Prefecture studied Chairman Mao Zedong's works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Combat Liberalism," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They also held three lectures.

	In Osaka, representatives from the Osaka Sino-Japanese Friendship Academy and various circles in Kansai also studied Chairman Mao Zedong's works in the course of the struggle, strengthening their confidence in victory. They firmly believe that no matter what difficulties the struggle may encounter, justice and victory are on their side.

    下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利
    日本青年坚持斗争反对佐藤破坏日中友好
    他们在斗争中学习毛主席著作更加坚定了胜利信心
    新华社十九日讯　东京消息：日本各地的青年代表连日来继续开展斗争，抗议日本佐藤政府拒发访华护照，阻挠他们到中国去参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的暴行。日本青年边斗争边学习毛主席著作，更加坚定了他们的斗争信心。
    日本青年代表十月十六日在东京举行了各县代表大会。大会一致通过决议，坚决支持日本各界三十二位人士九月二十六日发表的呼吁促进日中友好运动的声明，坚决支持日中友好协会访华代表团和中日友好协会代表团十月十二日在北京签署的共同声明。与会代表还决定，要同国内外所有破坏日中友好的势力进行斗争，要为进一步促进日中两国人民间的人员往来和文化、经济交流而斗争。
    在东京，从代表团团员十月四日成立东京斗争委员会以来，团员们分为六个小组，连日对外务省展开了抗议拒绝发给护照的斗争。
    在十月十日，当出席了联合国大会的外务大臣椎名悦三郎回到东京的时候，有八十名团员在羽田机场集会，抗议外务省拒发访华护照的无理决定。团员们不顾警察的阻挠，集合在椎名预定举行记者招待会的贵宾室前面，一齐举起了写有“反对敌视中国”、“日中两国人民的友好和团结万岁”、“政府立即发给护照”等口号的标语牌举行示威。椎名因此被迫在飞机旁边接见记者，随后偷偷离开机场。
    青年代表们在各地也开展了积极的活动。在山形、櫔木、爱知、熊本等县，他们向广大的工人、市民印发关于斗争情况的传单，呼吁他们支援斗争。
    各地的代表团团员分别展开了富有创造性的宣传活动和热烈的学习活动。山口县代表们学习了毛泽东主席的《为人民服务》、《反对自由主义》和《愚公移山》等著作。他们还举办了三次讲演会。
    在大阪，大阪日中友好学院、关西各界的代表们也在斗争中学习毛泽东主席的著作，坚定了胜利的信心。他们坚信：不管斗争会碰到什么样的困难，正义和胜利是属于他们的。
