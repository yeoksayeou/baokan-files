The heroic deed of this soldier in the style of Ouyang Hai has deeply moved the broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guards. People mourn him, sing his praises, and are determined to learn from his boundless love for Chairman Mao and his boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly sacrificing for the revolution and bravely giving his life for the people, embodying the great communist spirit.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, October 30th: Recently, among the revolutionary young Red Guards and the broad masses in the Hangzhou area, a moving and heart-stirring heroic deed has been widely praised: Soldier Cai Yongxiang of the Third Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, stationed at the Qiantang River Bridge, bravely stepped forward in a critical moment when a train full of Red Guards was in danger. He used his life to protect the Qiantang River Bridge and the Red Guards on the train. People praise Cai Yongxiang as another Ouyang Hai-style hero of the great Mao Zedong era, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, a good son of the people, and a loyal defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In October, the country was in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Trains full of young Red Guards were traveling south and north, day and night. The Qiantang River Bridge connected the southeastern part of the country with the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing, serving as a link for the revolutionary linking-up movement.

At 2:34 AM on October 10th, after a brief rain, the night was dark, and the mist was thick by the Qiantang River. Cai Yongxiang was on duty at the south end of the bridge. At that moment, a special train for Red Guards, Train No. 764, was approaching from the direction of Nanchang, heading straight to Beijing. The young revolutionaries in the carriages, filled with boundless love for the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, all wanted to fly to Chairman Mao's side at once. As the train approached the south end of the Qiantang River Bridge, it was speeding towards the bridgehead at 60 kilometers per hour. In the train's headlights, Cai Yongxiang suddenly noticed a large piece of wood lying across the tracks about 40 meters ahead. This was sabotage by class enemies who harbored deep hatred for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! If the wood was not removed, the train would derail, causing casualties and possibly destroying the bridge. In this critical moment, Cai Yongxiang rushed towards the train without hesitation.

The train driver saw a figure rushing towards the train and immediately applied the emergency brake. However, the momentum of the moving train pushed it forward. It was extremely dangerous! Cai Yongxiang jumped onto the tracks, lifted the large piece of wood, and jumped to the right side of the tracks just as the train roared past and safely stopped on the bridge. The Red Guards were saved, and the Qiantang River Bridge was preserved. However, Chairman Mao's good soldier Cai Yongxiang sacrificed his life heroically under the impact of the train!

Cai Yongxiang fulfilled his pledge written in his diary before his death: "Mao Zedong's works shine with golden light, illuminating the hearts of soldiers, standing firm on class principles, daring to face even the collapse of the sky and earth!" The young Red Guards were deeply moved and said, "Class enemies hate the Red Guards the most, while the People's Liberation Army loves the Red Guards the most. Comrade Cai Yongxiang sacrificed himself to save us. We must learn from the hero and fearlessly give our lives for the revolution. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!"

Comrade Cai Yongxiang was from Feidong County, Anhui Province, born into a poor peasant family with deep grievances. In February of this year, at the age of 18, he joined the army with a deep hatred for class enemies and a strong desire to defend the motherland. As soon as he arrived at the company, he firmly responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call and decided: to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Cai Yongxiang loved Chairman Mao the most. He said, "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Cai Yongxiang. Chairman Mao is the red sun in my heart!" "I am like a child learning to walk, guided and taught by Chairman Mao to walk the revolutionary path. I will never waver and will follow Chairman Mao to the end." Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, he took firm revolutionary steps and quickly grew into a strong revolutionary soldier.

Cai Yongxiang loved reading Chairman Mao's books the most. After joining the army, he used his first allowance to buy three books by Chairman Mao. He wrote in his diary, "Chairman Mao's works are treasures, the more you study, the more enlightened you become." He diligently studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," continually transformed his worldview, and took Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the old man carrying a mountain as examples, serving the people wholeheartedly.

Cai Yongxiang loved propagating Mao Zedong Thought the most. Although he had only studied for a little over two years, he wrote many programs to propagate Mao Zedong Thought with unwavering perseverance. The first program he performed in his company was to sing praises to Chairman Mao. He sang passionately, "Stars in the sky, shining bright, the brightest star cannot compare to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is our great savior, in my heart, there is only Chairman Mao's star."

Cai Yongxiang loved acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions the most. He often said, "As long as it aligns with Chairman Mao's instructions, I will do it!" "A person should live like Norman Bethune, dedicating his entire life and energy to the cause of human liberation!" In the short eight months in the army, he did many good deeds. People praised him as a "living Lei Feng."

Cai Yongxiang loved learning from heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought the most. He always took Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and other heroes as examples, learning from their thoughts, walking their paths, and creating their achievements. He said, "Ouyang Hai is a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, one can stand firm, even if the sky falls, and dare to face life-and-death situations. I must learn from him."

Cai Yongxiang bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought and hated those who opposed it the most. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Anyone who dares to oppose it will be smashed to pieces!" During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he wrote in his pledge, "This cultural revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In this struggle, I will dedicate everything to the Party and the people." Cai Yongxiang fulfilled his pledge with his heroic deed of saving the Red Guards, expressing his boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Cai Yongxiang dedicated his young life to the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. His brilliant heroic deeds deeply moved the revolutionary masses. People mourned him and sang his praises. The assistant driver of the train, Mao Zhishu, wrote in his diary on the day of the hero's sacrifice, "Comrade Cai Yongxiang, Mao Zedong Thought truly took root in your mind. You sacrificed yourself to protect the Red Guards and the Qiantang River Bridge. Your death is heavier than Mount Tai."

The young Red Guards in the Hangzhou area came in batches to the company where Cai Yongxiang had served. They recited Chairman Mao's quotations at the place where the hero sacrificed himself: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their blood-stained path!" They held high the red flags, carried their bags, and walked proudly past the place where the hero sacrificed himself, setting out on a revolutionary linking-up journey.

Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds inspired the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army. In the unit where the hero served, the activity of learning from Cai Yongxiang is being carried out in depth. One Cai Yongxiang has sacrificed himself, but ten thousand Cai Yongxiangs are growing. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers have expressed their determination: to resolutely follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, to learn from Cai Yongxiang, to consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, and to establish a selfless worldview of the proletariat.

    “有了毛泽东思想才能真正过得硬，天塌下来也敢顶”
    蔡永祥英勇抢救红卫兵专车
    这位欧阳海式战士的英雄事迹，深深感动着广大革命群众和红卫兵小将。人们悼念他，传颂他，决心学习他无限热爱毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想，为革命不怕粉身碎骨、为人民英勇献身的伟大共产主义精神。
    新华社杭州三十日电　最近，在杭州地区的革命小将红卫兵和广大群众中间，传颂着一件激动人心、感人肺腑的英雄事迹：守卫在钱塘江大桥的解放军某部三连战士蔡永祥，在一列满载红卫兵的火车面临危险的紧急关头，挺身而出，用生命保卫了钱塘江大桥，保卫了列车上的红卫兵。人们称赞蔡永祥是伟大毛泽东时代的又一个欧阳海式的英雄，是毛主席的好战士，是人民的好儿子，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者。
    十月，全国正处在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中。一列列满载红卫兵小将的火车，南来北往，昼夜奔驰。钱塘江大桥，把祖国东南方和无产阶级文化大革命中心——北京，紧紧地联系在一起，成为革命大串连的纽带。
    十月十日凌晨二点三十四分，秋雨刚过，夜色昏黑，钱塘江畔，雾气朦朦。蔡永祥在大桥南头执勤。这时，从南昌方向开来了764次直达北京的红卫兵专车。车厢里的革命小将们，怀着对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席无比热爱的心情，都想一下子飞到毛主席身边。当列车接近钱塘江大桥南端转弯处时，以每小时六十公里的速度向桥头冲来。在列车灯光的照射下，蔡永祥突然发现前面四十多米的铁轨上，横置着一根大木头。这是对无产阶级文化大革命怀有刻骨仇恨的阶级敌人在搞破坏活动！如果不排除这根木头，火车就会出轨，造成人员伤亡，甚至撞毁大桥。在这千钧一发的紧急关头，蔡永祥奋不顾身地迎着列车奔去。
    火车司机发现一个身影迎着列车冲来，立即采取紧急制动。但是，运动的惯力仍然推着列车向前猛冲。真是危险万分！只见蔡永祥跃进轨道，奋力抱起大木头，正向铁轨右侧跃去，列车呼啸而过，安全地停在大桥上。红卫兵脱险了，钱塘江大桥保住了。但是，毛主席的好战士蔡永祥同志，在火车冲撞下壮烈地牺牲了！
    蔡永祥同志就是这样，用自己的英勇行为实现了他生前在日记上写下的誓言：“毛主席著作闪金光，照得战士心里亮，阶级立场站得稳，天塌地裂也敢上！”红卫兵小将们万分激动地说：“阶级敌人最恨红卫兵，解放军最爱红卫兵。蔡永祥同志为了抢救我们牺牲了，我们一定要向英雄学习，为革命不怕粉身碎骨，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的统帅下，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    蔡永祥同志是安徽省肥东县人，出身在一个苦大仇深的贫农家庭里。今年二月，他刚满十八岁，就怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，怀着保卫祖国的强烈愿望入伍了。他一到连队，就坚决响应林彪同志的号召，下定决心：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    蔡永祥最热爱毛主席。他说：“有了毛主席，才有我蔡永祥，毛主席是我心中的红太阳！”“我像一个学走路的孩子，是毛主席扶着我，领着我，教会我走革命的路。我永不变心，永远跟着毛主席走到底。”在毛泽东思想的哺育下，他迈开了坚定的革命步伐，迅速成长为坚强的革命战士。
    蔡永祥最爱读毛主席的书。入伍后，他第一次领到津贴费，就用来买了三本毛主席著作。他在日记上写道：“毛主席著作是件宝，越学心里越开窍。”他刻苦学习“老三篇”，不断改造世界观，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公为榜样，全心全意为人民服务。
    蔡永祥最爱宣传毛泽东思想。他只读过两年多书，却以顽强的毅力，编写了许多宣传毛泽东思想的节目。他在连队自编自演的第一个节目，就是歌唱毛主席。他充满激情地唱道：“天上星，亮晶晶，最亮的星也比不上毛主席。毛主席是我们的大救星，我心中只有毛主席这颗星。”
    蔡永祥最爱照毛主席的指示办事。他经常说：“只要符合毛主席指示的事，我就干！”“一个人活着，就应该像白求恩那样把自己的毕生精力和整个生命，为人类的解放事业全部献出！”他在部队短短的八个月中，做了很多好事。人们称赞他是“活的雷锋”。
    蔡永祥最爱学习用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物。他处处以雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊等英雄为榜样，学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩。他说：“欧阳海是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，有了毛泽东思想才能真正过得硬，天塌下来也敢顶，生死关头也能冲。我一定要向他学习。”
    蔡永祥最勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想，最仇恨反对毛泽东思想的人。他说：“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，谁敢反对，就把他砸得粉身碎骨！”在无产阶级文化大革命中，他在决心书上写道：“这次文化大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级你死我活的斗争。在这场斗争中，我要把自己的一切献给党和人民。”蔡永祥用抢救红卫兵的英雄行为，实现了自己的誓言，表达了他对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚。
    蔡永祥把自己年青的生命，献给了壮丽的无产阶级文化大革命。他的光辉的英雄事迹，深深感动着革命群众，人们悼念他，传颂他。驾驶这趟列车的副司机毛志树，在英雄牺牲的当天，怀着敬仰的心情，在日记上写道：“蔡永祥同志，毛泽东思想真正在你的头脑里扎了根。你，为了保卫红卫兵，保卫钱塘江大桥而牺牲，你的死，比泰山还重。”
    杭州地区的红卫兵小将们，一批又一批地来到蔡永祥生前所在的连队。他们在英雄牺牲的地方，朗诵着毛主席语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”他们高举红旗，背着背包，昂首阔步，走过英雄牺牲的地方，出发远征，去进行革命大串连。
    蔡永祥的英雄事迹，鼓舞着解放军广大指战员。在英雄所在的部队里，向蔡永祥学习的活动正在深入开展。一个蔡永祥牺牲了，千万个蔡永祥正在成长。广大指战员纷纷表示：最坚决地按照林彪同志的指示，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段，以蔡永祥为榜样，更自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观。（附图片）
