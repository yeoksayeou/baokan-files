The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU are colluding and actively engaging in the deception of peace talks. Their goal is to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national revolutionary war, to extinguish the flames of national revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to extinguish the flames of world revolution. As long as the people of the world keep their eyes open, their plots will not succeed.

    以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者，正在狼狈为奸，积极搞和谈欺骗的勾当，目的是要扑灭越南人民反美民族革命战争的烈火，扑灭亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族革命斗争的烈火，扑灭世界革命的烈火。只要全世界人民擦亮眼睛，他们的阴谋是不能得逞的。
