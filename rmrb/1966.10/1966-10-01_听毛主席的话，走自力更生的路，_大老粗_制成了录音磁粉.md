Listen to Chairman Mao's words, take the road of self-reliance. "Rough workers" produce magnetic powder for recording.

In 1960, our team was given the task of trying to produce high-strength magnetic powder. We were all very happy. In the old society, I worked as an apprentice in a dye shop and suffered from exploitation and oppression. The capitalists did not allow me to learn any technology. Now, the Party has entrusted us with such an important task. This is the Party's great trust in us workers. However, we were also a bit worried: could we, three rough workers lacking scientific knowledge, fill this gap? We had only heard that magnetic powder is made from iron oxide, but we had never seen what high-strength magnetic powder looks like. As for the technology and equipment needed, we were completely clueless. The difficulties were enormous. But I thought of the Party and Chairman Mao's call to break superstitions and liberate our minds, so I decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, overcome difficulties, and take on the responsibility.

The task was accepted. I asked the engineers what equipment was needed to produce high-strength magnetic powder. They said: to produce high-strength magnetic powder, we need a stainless steel double-layer sealed reaction pot, a vacuum dryer, a high-temperature oxidation furnace, etc., and a decent laboratory. I thought, now the country needs funds for all aspects of construction. We haven't even started the work, and we are already asking the state for money. How can this be? Chairman Mao said: "We advocate self-reliance." We cannot follow others' paths; we must rely on ourselves and forge our own path. What if there is no equipment? We will break the mold and make our own equipment. So, we immediately started looking in the scrapyard for old iron buckets, using enamel cups as reaction pots, glass rods and wooden rods as stirrers, and coal-burning stoves and iron pots as oxidation furnaces. Without a drying oven, we placed the materials in the sun to dry. Without a grinder, we used hammers to break them into pieces and hands to grind them into powder. In this way, relying on our experience of dealing with iron oxide for more than ten years, we designed a set of equipment without spending a single penny of the state's money and started working in a workshop with open windows on all sides.

To ensure the completion of the production task, we could only carry out the experimental work in our spare time. Day and night, we worked for more than a month, but the powder we produced had no magnetism. Later, after more than a hundred experiments and several months of time, we finally produced a powder with magnetism, but it still could not be used for recording.

Just at this time, a "cold wind" blew in. Some people sneered at us, saying: "You little guys also want to fly to the sky!" They also said: "Others have experts, engineers, foreign equipment, and scientific instruments, and they still can't produce it. How can you few 'rough workers,' using these broken-down equipment, conquer the scientific frontier?" I was very angry when I heard these words. Producing magnetic powder is a task given to us by the Party, a need of the revolution. They said these words, simply because they look down on us workers and do not believe that workers can do science. We must definitely succeed and fight for the honor of the working class.

We summarized our past experimental work. We realized that the key reason why we failed to produce high-strength magnetic powder was not that our equipment was crude, but that our work was not thorough enough, and the human factor had not been fully utilized. The road of science is full of twists and turns. We must be like the old man who moved mountains with a spade, attacking one by one the difficulties in the experiments.

So, we continued our experiments, using different processes to further explore. We thought about it while eating, walking, and sometimes even couldn't sleep. Later, I saw a sentence in a book: "To produce an organic product, use the method of violent oxidation..." I thought, could magnetic powder also be produced using the method of violent oxidation? So, we started working according to the principle of violent oxidation. Each time we tried, we sent a small sample to the cooperating factory to test. After four or five continuous trials, we finally produced a loud sound, which could be recorded. Everyone heard it and jumped for joy.

In this way, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we finally produced magnetic powder for recording. This enabled our relevant departments to use domestically produced magnetic powder to record the voices of the revolution.

### 听毛主席的话，走自力更生的路，“大老粗”制成了录音磁粉

     听毛主席的话，走自力更生的路，
    “大老粗”制成了录音磁粉
    上海革新塑料厂工人工程师　徐驿敏
    一九六○年，我们小组接到试制强力磁粉的任务，都很高兴。在旧社会，我在一家颜料店当学徒，受尽剥削和压迫，资本家根本不让我学技术。现在，党把这样一个重要的任务交给我们，这是党对我们工人的极大信任。但是，我们也有些担心：靠我们三个缺乏科学知识的大老粗，能不能填补这门空白呢？我们只听说磁粉是从氧化铁里搞出来的，强力磁粉是个啥样子也没见过。至于要用什么工艺，什么设备，更是一窍不通。困难是很大的。但是，我想到党和毛主席号召我们，要破除迷信，解放思想，就下决心，一定要按照毛主席的教导，克服困难，挑起重担。
    任务是接下来了。我问工程师搞强力磁粉需要什么设备。他们说：搞强力磁粉要不锈钢双层密闭反应锅，真空干燥器，高温焙烧氧化炉等等，还要个像样的试验室。我想，现在国家各方面都需要建设资金，我们事情还没有做，先向国家伸手要钱，这怎么行？毛主席说过：“我们是主张自力更生的。”我们不能照别人的路走，一定要自力更生，闯出自己的道路来。没有设备怎么办？我们就打破框框，自己搞土设备。说干就干，大家在露天仓库的废铁堆里找出旧铁桶，拿搪瓷杯当反应锅，用玻璃棒和木棒当搅拌器，用煤球炉和铁锅当氧化焙烧炉。没有烘箱就放在太阳下面晒。没有粉碎机就用榔头一块一块敲，用手一点一点捻。就这样，我们凭着和氧化铁打过十几年交道的经验，自己设计了一套设备，没有花国家一块钱，就在四面通风的工场间干了起来。
    为了保证生产任务的完成，我们的试验工作只能利用业余时间来搞。白天黑夜干，搞了一个多月，制出来的粉却没有磁性。以后，又经过一百多次的试验，花了几个月时间，好容易搞出了有磁性的粉，但仍然不能用于录音。
    正在这个时候，“冷风”随着吹来。有的人讽刺我们说：“你们小八腊子也想飞上天！”还说：“人家有专家，有工程师，有洋设备，有科学仪器，还搞不出来，难道你们这几个‘大老粗’，用这些破破烂烂的设备，能够攻下科学尖端？”听了这些话，我很生气。搞磁粉是党交给我们的任务，是革命的需要。他们说这些话，无非是看不起我们工人，不相信工人能搞科学。我们坚决要把它搞成功，为工人阶级争一口气。
    我们对过去的试验工作进行了小结。认识到强力磁粉没有试制成功，关键问题不在于设备土，而是我们的工作还没有做到家，人的因素还没有充分发挥。科学的道路是艰险曲折的，我们要像老愚公一锹一锹搬大山那样，一个一个地攻下试验中的难关。
    于是，我们又继续作试验，采用不同工艺进一步探索。吃饭想，走路想，有时觉也睡不着。后来我在一本书里看到一句话：“制造一种有机产品，采用激烈氧化法……”我想，磁粉是不是也可以采用激烈氧化的方法去试试呢？于是我们就根据激烈氧化的原理干起来。每试一次，就送一次小样给协作的兄弟厂，请他们试用测定。连续试验了四、五次，最后真的发出了响亮的声音，能够录音了。大家听了，都高兴得跳起来。
    就这样，在毛泽东思想的指导下，我们终于制造出了录音磁粉。从而使我们的有关部门，能够用国产的磁粉，录革命的声音。
