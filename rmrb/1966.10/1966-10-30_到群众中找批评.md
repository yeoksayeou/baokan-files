To seek criticism from the masses! This is a valuable experience from the Party branch of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army.

Last May, after the branch committee reported its work to the branch meeting, comrades only spoke of achievements and merits, without mentioning any shortcomings or mistakes. Was the branch's work truly flawless? No, there must be shortcomings. Therefore, several branch committee members went to talk to party members individually, and as a result, they heard many good suggestions.

This incident made them realize: the masses not raising criticisms of the leadership does not mean the masses have no criticisms. The reasons for not raising criticisms often include: the leadership's shortcomings are quite serious, and criticisms have been raised several times without any changes; or the shortcomings and mistakes are not yet clear; or there is a rift between the leadership and the masses. Therefore, when the masses cannot raise criticisms, the leadership should go to great lengths to seek criticisms from the masses, allowing the masses to speak their minds. Only in this way can problems be discovered and solved in a timely manner.

    到群众中找批评
    到群众中去“找批评”！这是解放军某部九连党支部的一条宝贵的经验。
    去年五月，支委会向支部大会报告工作后，让大家提意见，同志们只讲了成绩和优点，没有谈缺点和错误。支部工作是真的做得十全十美了吗？不，肯定有缺点。于是几个支委分头去找党员谈心，结果听到了不少好意见。
    这件事使他们认识到：群众对领导不提意见，不等于群众没有意见。造成不提意见的原因，往往是由于领导的缺点比较严重，提过几次意见也没有改；或者是对缺点和错误一时还拿不准；或者是和领导有隔阂。因此，在群众提不出批评意见的时候，领导应该千方百计地到群众中去找批评，让群众把心里的话讲出来，这样才能及时地发现和解决问题。
