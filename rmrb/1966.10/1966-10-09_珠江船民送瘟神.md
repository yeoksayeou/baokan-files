The east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has swiftly blown over the Pearl River, transforming the spiritual landscape of the boat people.

The boat people on the Pearl River have seen their class consciousness rise since liberation. However, some still harbor serious feudal superstitions. In their cramped cabins, they have hung pictures of sea dragons, Guanyin, household gods, wealth gods, earth gods, and other demonic spirits.

Recently, a group of Red Guards came aboard to propagate the Sixteen Points and to advocate the elimination of the "Four Olds." They chose some typical cases, using the method of recalling and contrasting, to recount the sufferings of the old society and the sufferings caused by feudal superstitions, thereby raising the boat people's consciousness. The boat people quickly took action themselves, smashing and burning all the colored paper and spirit tablets depicting demonic spirits.

Zhou Hao, a member of the San Community of Tugboats, is a woman with particularly serious feudal superstitions. In the past, on every festival of the gods, she would burn incense and light candles, spending a lot of money. Now she has burned all those demonic spirits in one go and tells everyone, "In the past, I was superstitious because I hadn't studied Chairman Mao's works. This Cultural Revolution has made me read Chairman Mao's books, and my mind is now clear. I can't be a fool anymore."

Now, when relatives and friends from the mainland come aboard, they see the cabins clean and tidy, with portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao's works hanging, displaying a revolutionary new atmosphere.

    珠江船民送瘟神
    无产阶级文化大革命的东风，迅猛地吹到了珠江上，改变着水上船户的精神面貌。
    珠江上的船户，解放后阶级觉悟有了提高。但还有些船民，残存着相当严重的封建迷信思想，在他们窄小的船舱里，贴满着海龙王、观音、家神、财神、土地爷等等牛鬼蛇神的画像。
    不久前，一批红卫兵宣传员，来到船上宣传十六条，宣传除“四旧”。他们选择了一些典型事例，用回忆对比的方法，诉旧社会的苦，诉封建迷信的苦，提高了船民的觉悟。船民们很快就自己动手，把那些画着牛鬼蛇神的五色纸和神主牌，统统砸烂烧毁。
    驳船三社社员周好，是一个封建迷信思想比较严重的妇女，过去每逢什么鬼神的节日，她都要烧香点烛，花费许多钱。现在她把那些牛鬼蛇神一把火烧光了，逢人便说：“过去我迷信，是因为没有学习毛主席著作，这次文化大革命，我读了毛主席的书，我的思想亮堂了，我不能再做一个糊涂人。”
    现在，陆上的亲戚朋友走到船上来，看到船舱清洁干净，挂着毛主席像，贴着毛主席语录，显出一派革命的新气象。
