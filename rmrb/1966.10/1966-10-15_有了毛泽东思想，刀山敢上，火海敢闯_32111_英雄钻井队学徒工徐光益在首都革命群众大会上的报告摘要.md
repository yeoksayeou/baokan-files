I am nineteen years old this year. I came to the petroleum sector last October to learn how to operate a diesel engine. In the past, because I did not study Chairman Mao's works well, I did not understand that extracting oil is also for the revolution.

When I first joined the drilling team, I only wanted to learn the technology, thinking that if I mastered the technology, I could drive a tractor or a car in the future. Therefore, I was very mischievous and did not take my work seriously. I would fall asleep during night shifts and not rest well after night shifts, always going out to play, climbing mountains, and driving on highways.

Chairman Mao said, "Our responsibility is to the people..." I made up my mind to serve the people wholeheartedly, like Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune.

Later, with the help of my senior colleagues, I began to study Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" repeatedly. Chairman Mao said, "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must benefit the people. If there are any mistakes, they must be corrected. This is what it means to be responsible to the people." I thought, Zhang Zedong was a young man who sacrificed his precious life for the revolutionary cause. I am also a young man. Why can't I serve the people wholeheartedly like Comrade Zhang Zedong? Chairman Mao also taught us, "The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the end, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I felt very ashamed. I thought that if I continued like this, I would lose my peasant roots and let down the Party and Chairman Mao's care and cultivation for us young people. I should abandon all selfish thoughts and serve the people wholeheartedly like Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune. I realized that to be revolutionary, one must study Chairman Mao's works well and resolutely change old habits and bad work styles. From then on, whenever I had problems in my thoughts or encountered difficulties at work, I insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to solve them, taking Chairman Mao's words as my guide to action, finding the revolutionary direction and drawing revolutionary strength from Chairman Mao's works.

On the night of June 21, after midnight, I was still studying Chairman Mao's articles on class and class struggle. I thought that our country is in the midst of a great proletarian cultural revolution, and we workers must be at the forefront of this cultural revolution, resolutely fighting against all anti-party and anti-socialist rightists! After finishing my studies and just about to sleep, suddenly there was a loud "boom" from the well site, like an explosion. I quickly got out of bed, put on my shoes, and rushed to the well site.

I ran to the well site and saw that it was on fire, with flames burning fiercely. What should I do? I should rush in to extinguish the fire!

But I am just an apprentice, I have never seen natural gas, let alone such a big fire. Rushing in might result in sacrifice. At this moment, Chairman Mao gave me instructions, as if he was kindly saying to me, "Little comrade, charge ahead! Don't be afraid of death! To struggle is to have sacrifices, and deaths are common. But the meaning of death is different. If you think of the people's interests and the suffering of the majority, dying for the people's interests is a noble death, heavier than Mount Tai." Thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I was full of energy and immediately charged into the sea of fire. Just a few steps in, I thought, what use is it to rush in empty-handed? If I rush to the water valve and open it, I can extinguish the fire. I rushed to the valve without hesitation, bent down to open the water valve. This place is only about ten meters from the wellhead, and the fire burned my head, back, and legs. But I didn't care about the pain, I opened two valves with all my might. Then a few seniors rushed over and opened all the valves. I and Comrade Peng Jiatong and a few others picked up the water hose and rushed to the machine room's number five valve.

Chairman Mao said, "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." I was full of strength, crawled up from the ground, and charged into the fire again.

At that time, I couldn't even hear myself speak, the gas was roaring. We fought there for a few minutes. The gas was strong, and the fire was fierce. In no time, I was knocked down in the fire net and fainted. Comrade Hu Debing carried me out of the well site, gave me some water, and I came to my senses. Looking up, the fire was still raging. Seeing the seniors rushing in, their faces and hands burned, being rescued and rushing back into the fire, I wanted to charge into the fire again. But my thoughts struggled: I had just charged in and fought for a few minutes, and I was knocked down. This time, charging in would be even more dangerous. At this moment, I thought of Chairman Mao's instructions to the petroleum workers to find gas and oil, thinking: the Party often educates us that a revolutionary, a worker, in critical moments, must stand out, must dare to ascend the knife mountain and charge into the sea of fire. I am a petroleum worker armed with Mao Zedong Thought and must not be a coward or a deserter! Human life is precious, but the revolutionary cause is even more precious. I struggled to get up from the ground, staggering, and charged into the fire again. Just as I reached the middle of the well site, I felt dizzy, my head heavy and my feet light, and I fainted again. At this moment, it seemed as if Chairman Mao was kindly teaching me, "Little comrade, charge ahead! Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's words gave me the greatest strength. I got up from the ground, staggering, and charged into the drilling platform again.

Chairman Mao said, "The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is what a good comrade does." I saw that the number three valve was the most difficult place, so I charged in to fight fiercely with the raging fire.

Where should I go to work? Chairman Mao taught us, "The more difficult the place, the more we must go, this is what a good comrade does." I thought, now the number three valve is the key, the most difficult place, I must charge in. I charged into the drilling platform and saw Comrade Hu Debing holding a water hose, covering the comrades to close the number three valve. He had not left the front line and was already at his limit. I quickly took the water hose from his hand and covered the comrades to close the number three valve. Other seniors rescued Comrade Hu Debing. As soon as he left, the task fell on me. Under the drilling platform was a place wrapped in raging flames, the wooden planks of the platform burned into charcoal, falling on our backs, burning our flesh with a sizzling sound, and the water below was like boiling water, scorching my feet. At this moment, I felt truly in difficulty, wanting to throw away the hose and retreat from the platform to rest. But I thought, I can't throw it away, I must not throw it away, throwing away this hose is throwing away the lives of my class brothers, throwing away the revolutionary soul and the people's interests. Persist, persist is victory. Our revolutionary forerunners, for today's happiness, did not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice. Comrade Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the enemy's machine gun, annihilated the enemy, and achieved victory. Heroic figures are inspiring me, they are not afraid of death, how can I be afraid of pain? We are petroleum workers with iron bones, armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In such extremely difficult situations, we must stand firm, chest out, for the sake of rescuing state property, even if it means burning my hands, burning my feet, even if it means dying here, I must hold the position, I must protect the gas field.

The fire toppled the derrick, but our revolutionary will cannot be toppled. The fire melted the steel, but our loyal hearts to Chairman Mao and the Party cannot be melted. The fire scorched the trees and crumbled the stones, but it can never crumble the iron bones of petroleum workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. I gritted my teeth, endured the pain, and fought on. After a fierce battle, my comrades opened the blowing number eight and number five valves and closed the number three valve. The raging fires on the drilling platform and the machine room were also put out by Comrades Wang Youfa and others. I rushed out of the drilling platform and saw that there was still some fire burning in the machine room. I wanted to extinguish the last of the fire, but after a few steps, I smelled a strong smell of hydrogen sulfide, and I immediately felt dizzy and fainted. Later, I heard that Comrades Zhou Wenhua and others sent me to the hospital.

The next afternoon, after I regained consciousness, I heard the political instructor say: In this battle, Comrades Zhang Yongqing and others sacrificed their precious lives for the Party, for the people, and for the petroleum cause. I was deeply saddened by the sacrifice of my close comrades. They died for the people's interests, their deaths are glorious, heavier than Mount Tai, and their revolutionary spirit will forever live in our hearts.

Later, the doctors and nurses told us: The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao knew that we were injured while rescuing state property and sent a plane with medicine and the most experienced doctors to rescue us. This is not just sending medicine and doctors, but sending the hearts of the people of the whole country. This made us extremely grateful. The Party and Chairman Mao are closer than mothers. A mother can only give birth to me, but the Party and Chairman Mao cultivated me to establish the thought of serving the people. This time, I was injured while saving the well, and I was quickly healed. It is the Party and Chairman Mao who gave us a second life. We cannot express our gratitude with a thousand words, I love the Party and Chairman Mao even more.

Chairman Mao said, "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life..." I am determined to establish the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and contribute to the country's petroleum cause.

In this bloody battle against the fire, I only did a little of what I should have done. The Party and the people of the whole country gave me the highest honor, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest care. This glory belongs to the great Party and Chairman Mao, and to the people of the whole country.

In the future, I will study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively. Chairman Mao's books should be read every day, and Chairman Mao's words should be listened to every sentence. A person can go a few days without eating or sleeping, but Chairman Mao's books cannot be left unread for a moment. The head can be cut off, the blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. I will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. Chairman Mao said, "It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do bad deeds, to be consistently beneficial to the broad masses, to be consistently beneficial to the youth, to be consistently beneficial to the revolution, to struggle hard for decades like one day, this is the most difficult!" I am determined to learn from the People's Liberation Army and the Daqing people, to establish the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, to contribute to the country's petroleum cause, to drill more wells, to drill wells faster, to produce more oil and gas, and to repay the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country with practical actions for their care and cultivation.

    有了毛泽东思想，刀山敢上，火海敢闯
    ——32111英雄钻井队学徒工徐光益在首都革命群众大会上的报告摘要
    我今年十九岁，是去年十月份刚从农村到石油部门来学开柴油机的。过去由于没有很好学习毛主席著作，根本不懂得搞石油也是为了革命。
    刚到井队时我光想学技术，认为学会了技术，以后好开拖拉机，开汽车。所以，我平时调皮得很，工作时也不负责任，上夜班就打瞌睡，下夜班又不很好休息，到处去玩，爬山呀！转公路呀！
    毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。……”我下定决心，像张思德、白求恩那样，全心全意为人民服务。
    后来，我在老师傅的帮助下，开始反复学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》等著作。毛主席说：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”我想，张思德是个青年，为了革命的事业，能够献出他宝贵的生命，我也是个青年，难道就不能像张思德同志那样全心全意为人民服务吗？毛主席又教导我们：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”通过毛主席著作的学习，心里感到很惭愧。我想，长期下去，就会把贫农的本色丢掉，就对不起党和毛主席对我们青年的关怀和培养。我应该丢掉一切私心杂念，要像张思德、白求恩那样，全心全意地为人民服务。我认识到，一个人要革命，就必须把毛主席著作学好，坚决改掉那些老毛病、坏作风。从此，思想上产生了啥子问题，工作中遇到了啥子困难，我就坚持运用毛泽东思想来解决，把毛主席的话当作自己行动的指南，从毛主席著作中找革命方向，吸取革命的力量。
    六月二十一日那天晚上十二点多，我还在学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的文章。我想，我国正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，我们工人阶级要站在这场文化大革命的最前头，坚决向一切反党反社会主义的右派分子开火！学完，正准备要睡觉，忽然从井场传来了“轰”的一声，像炸弹一样。我赶忙从床上起来，穿上鞋拚命往井场跑。
    我连冲带跑，冲到井场一看，井场烧起来了，火燃得大得很。怎么办呢？应该冲上去灭火！
    但是，我是个学徒工，从来没有看到过天然气，更没有看到过这样大的火，冲上去可能有牺牲。这时，毛主席他老人家给我作指示了，好像亲切对我说：“小鬼，冲啊！不要怕死！要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但死的意义有不同，想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，为了人民利益，就是死了，也是死得其所，也是光荣的，比泰山还重。”想到了毛主席的教导，我浑身是劲，立刻往火海里冲。刚刚冲了几步，又想我空手去冲有什么用呢？如果冲到水管那里去，开了闸门，就能灭火。我就不顾一切，冲到闸门边，弯下腰去开水闸门。这个地方离开井口只有十多米，火烧得我的脑壳、背、脚杆痛得很。但是我不管痛不痛，拚命开了两个闸门。接着来了几个师傅争着把闸门全部打开了。我和彭家治队长几个人，抱起水龙带，就往机房那边的五号闸门冲。
    毛主席说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我浑身充满力量，从地上爬起来，又一次冲进火海。
    当时，说话都听不到，气声“哇哇哇”的直叫。我们在那里搏斗了几分钟。气大，火猛，不一会就把我冲倒在火网里面，昏过去了。胡德炳师傅把我背出井场外边，吃了点水，清醒转来一看，火还是大得很。看见师傅们冲上去，脸、手被烧烂，抢救出来，又往火里冲。我想再往火海里冲，思想却有了斗争：刚才冲进去搏斗了几分钟，把我冲倒了，这次冲进去危险更大。这时我想起了毛主席对石油工人发出的找气找油的最高指示，心想：党经常教育我们，一个革命者，工人阶级，在关键时刻，要挺身而出，要刀山敢上，火海敢闯。我是毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人，决不能当怕死鬼，当逃兵！人的生命是宝贵的，但革命事业更宝贵。我就使劲地从地上爬了起来，偏偏倒倒，二次冲进火海。刚冲到井场中间，我觉得天旋地转，头重脚轻，一下子又昏倒在地上。这时好像毛主席亲切地教导我说：“小鬼，冲呀！下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话给我最大的力量。我从地上爬起来了，偏偏倒倒，又一次冲进钻台下面。
    毛主席说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我看到三号闸门是最困难的地方，我就冲进去同熊熊烈火顽强搏斗。
    我到什么地方去工作呢？毛主席教导我们：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”我想，现在三号闸门是关键，是最困难的地方，我一定要冲进去。我冲进钻台，看到胡德炳师傅抱了一根水龙带，正在掩护同志们抢关三号闸门。他一直没有下火线，已经招架不住了。我急忙接过他手里的水龙带，掩护同志们抢关三号闸门。其他师傅把胡德炳救了出去。他一走，任务就落到我身上了。钻台下面是熊熊烈火包着的地方，钻台木板烧成了炭花，一颗一颗地往我们背上掉，烧得我们背上的肉吱吱地响，下面的水又像开水一样烫得我双脚直跳。这时，我感到真是困难，想把胶皮管线甩了，退出钻台来休息。但是，我又想，不能甩，千万不能甩，把这根管线甩了，就是把阶级弟兄的生命甩了，就是把革命的灵魂和人民的利益甩掉了。坚持，坚持就是胜利。我们的革命老前辈，为了今天的幸福，不惜流血牺牲。黄继光同志用胸口抵住敌人的机枪眼，消灭了敌人，得到了胜利。英雄人物在鼓舞着我，他们死都不怕，难道我还怕痛吗？我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的硬骨头石油工人，在这种万分困难的情况下，腰要硬起来，胸要挺起来，为了抢救国家财产，那怕是烧掉我的手，烧掉我的脚，就是烧死在这里，也要守住阵地，也要保住大气田。
    火把井架烧倒了，但我们革命的意志烧不倒，火把钢铁熔化了，我们忠实于毛主席，忠实于党的一颗红心熔不化，火把树木烧焦，把石头烧烂，但永远烧不烂用毛泽东思想武装起来的石油工人的硬骨头精神。我咬紧牙，忍着痛，拚哪，拚哪，拚哪，经过一场大恶战，同志们把放喷的八号、五号闸门打开了，三号闸门关上了，钻台、机房的熊熊大火，也被王有发等师傅连人带被压下去了。我冲出钻台，看到机房里还有些火在烧着。我想去灭最后的小火，刚走了几步，闻到一阵硫化氢臭味，顿时冲得我头昏眼花，啥都不知道了。后来，听说是周文华等同志把我送进了医院。
    第二天下午我苏醒以后，听见指导员说：在这次战斗中，张永庆等几位同志把自己宝贵的生命献给了党，献给了人民，献给了石油事业。我为亲密战友的牺牲感到万分悲痛。他们为了人民利益而死，死的光荣，重于泰山，他们的革命精神永远活在我们心里。
    后来，医生和护士对我们说：党中央和毛主席知道你们抢救国家财产受了伤，派飞机送来了药品，送来了最有经验的医生进行抢救。这不仅是送来了药物和医生，而是送来了全国人民的心意。这使我们万分感激。党和毛主席比母亲还亲。母亲只能生我，党和毛主席培养我树立了为人民服务的思想。我这次救井负了伤，很快就给治好了。是党和毛主席给了我们第二次生命，我们用千言万语都不能表达出内心感激的心情，我更加热爱党和毛主席。
    毛主席说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，……”我决心树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，为祖国石油事业贡献力量。
    这次血战火海的战斗中，我只做了一点自己应做的工作，党和全国人民给了我最高的荣誉，最大的鼓舞，最大的关怀，这个光荣应归功于伟大的党和毛主席，归功于全国人民。
    今后，我要更加活学活用毛主席著作，毛主席的书要天天读，毛主席的话要句句听。一个人几天不吃饭、不睡觉没有关系，毛主席的书一刻也不能不读。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。我要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。毛主席说：“一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众，一贯的有益于青年，一贯的有益于革命，艰苦奋斗几十年如一日，这才是最难最难的呵！”我决心向解放军学习，向大庆人学习，树立“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务的思想，为祖国石油事业贡献力量，多打井，快打井，多拿油，多拿气，以实际行动报答党和毛主席以及全国人民对我们的关怀和培养。（附图片）
