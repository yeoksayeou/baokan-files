    Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's working class.

    The Central Committee of the Marxist-Leninist Center of the Netherlands issued a letter to Chairman Mao, stating: "We assure you that we will hold high the great banner of your thought and develop Marxism-Leninism in the Netherlands."

    Xinhua News Agency, October 20th: The Dutch magazine "Red Forum" published in its eighth and ninth combined issue a letter from the Central Committee of the "Marxist-Leninist Center" of the Netherlands to Chairman Mao. The letter points out that Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's working class, and Chairman Mao's works are the guiding principles for all Marxist-Leninists around the world.

    The letter states, "We Dutch Marxist-Leninists regard you as the chairman of all Marxist-Leninists in the world, the leader of the world's working class, and we sincerely express our affection to you and the Communist Party of China—the vanguard of world Marxism-Leninism."

    The letter states: "Our monthly magazine 'Red Forum' supports the correct proposals of the Communist Party of China and other Marxist-Leninist parties, and we emphasize the study of your works, because your works not only serve the Chinese people but also become the guiding principles for all Marxist-Leninists in the world."

    The letter, when discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, points out: "We fully support the guiding ideology and the methods adopted to carry out this movement. The Chinese Cultural Revolution is a major event in the history of Marxism-Leninism. We will seriously study the development and achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and apply the principles of this revolution to our environment."

    The letter points out that in order to study Chairman Mao's works, "We will translate more of your works into Dutch so that Dutch workers can more easily study them. Although the situation in the Netherlands is very different from that in China, we are deeply aware that we can learn many experiences from the Communist Party of China, especially your thoughts on mass work, ideological education, cultural development, and opposition to oppressors and revisionists."

    The letter states: "Dear Chairman Mao!

    "We want you to know that the working class of the Netherlands, united around the Marxist-Leninist Center of the Netherlands, sincerely loves you and regards you as their revered leader."

    The letter states: "We want you to know that we place great importance on studying your works and discussing these works with comrades.

    "We want you to know that under your leadership, Marxist-Leninists will guide the masses of the world through the revolutionary path to socialism and communism.

    "We want you to know that we are prepared to struggle for such a revolution, and we firmly believe that we can, together with the Marxist-Leninist parties and groups of our neighboring countries, defeat capitalism, monopolies, and revisionism in this region of Europe.

    "We assure you that we will hold high the great banner of your thought and develop Marxism-Leninism in the Netherlands."

    The letter also points out that the people of the Netherlands resolutely oppose the shameful aggression of the United States against Vietnam and oppose the so-called "peace talks" by the British, Indian, and Soviet revisionist groups. We believe that only when American troops completely withdraw from Vietnam can peace be restored in that region.

    毛主席是世界工人阶级的领袖
    荷兰马克思列宁主义中心中央委员会发表给毛主席的信，表示：“我们向您保证，我们将高举您的思想的伟大旗帜，在荷兰发展马克思列宁主义。”
    新华社二十日讯　荷兰《红色论坛》在今年第八、九期合刊上发表荷兰“马克思列宁主义中心”中央委员会给毛主席的一封信，信中指出，毛主席是全世界工人阶级的领袖，毛主席的著作是全世界马克思列宁主义者的行动指针。
    这封信说，“我们荷兰马克思列宁主义者把您看成是全世界马克思列宁主义者的主席，全世界工人阶级的领袖，谨向您和中国共产党——世界马克思列宁主义的先锋队——表达我们热诚的情谊。”
    信中说：“我们的月刊《红色论坛》支持中国共产党和其他马克思列宁主义政党的正确主张，并且我们强调学习您的著作，因为您的著作不仅为中国人民服务，而且成为全世界马克思列宁主义者的指针。”
    这封信在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时指出：“我们完全支持这个运动的指导思想和为了进行这个运动所采用的方法。中国文化革命是马克思列宁主义历史上的大事件，我们将认真地学习中国文化革命的发展和成果，并将这场革命的原则运用于我们所处的环境。”
    信中指出，为了学习毛主席著作，“我们将把您的著作越来越多地翻译成荷兰文，使荷兰工人更便于学习它。虽然荷兰的情况大大不同于中国，我们深知我们可以向中国共产党学习许多经验，特别是学习您关于群众工作、思想教育、发展文化、反对压迫者和修正主义者等思想。”
    这封信说：“敬爱的毛主席！
    “愿您知道，团结在荷兰马克思列宁主义中心的周围的荷兰工人阶级，衷心地爱戴您，把您看成是他们崇敬的领袖。”
    信中说：“愿您知道，我们非常重视学习您的著作，并和同志们讨论这些著作。
    “愿您知道，在您领导下的马克思列宁主义者，将引导全世界的群众通过革命道路走向社会主义和共产主义。
    “愿您知道，我们已经准备为这样的革命而奋斗，而且我们深信能够同我们邻国的马克思列宁主义政党和小组一起来击败欧洲这个地区的资本主义、垄断组织和修正主义。
    “我们向您保证，我们将高举您的思想的伟大旗帜，在荷兰发展马克思列宁主义。”
    信里还指出，荷兰人民坚决反对美国对越南进行的可耻的侵略战争，并反对英国、印度和苏联修正主义集团的所谓“和谈”。我们认为，只有美国军队全部撤出越南，才能在那个地区恢复和平。
