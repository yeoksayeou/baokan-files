Now, the people of the entire nation are enthusiastically responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study the "Three Articles" extensively and apply them extensively, striving to reform their thinking and carry out a revolution in their souls.

In an article written 22 years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests. Comrade Zhang Side is a comrade in our army."

To accompany the study of the "Three Articles," today's newspaper publishes an article recalling Comrade Zhang Side, which provides a detailed introduction to Zhang Side's deeds of wholeheartedly serving the people.

We are currently engaged in the great socialist revolution and socialist construction. To build a new society, we must build new types of people. These new types of people are like Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, Jiao Yulu, and the heroes of the 32111 drilling team, who possess a great communist spirit. These people are the noble, pure, moral individuals who have detached themselves from lowly interests and are beneficial to the people, as Chairman Mao said.

For thousands of years, human society, whether it was a slave society, feudal society, or capitalist society, was all built on the foundation of private ownership. The culture of the reactionary ruling classes over thousands of years has all served private ownership and defended private ownership concepts. Socialist society is based on public ownership. To consolidate and develop the socialist system, it is necessary to eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. If we do not carry out a socialist revolution in the ideological realm and allow various private ownership concepts to spread freely, the public ownership economy will collapse, the dictatorship of the proletariat will not be consolidated, and the socialist state will change color. The Soviet Union, born in the Great October Revolution, provides a serious lesson as it moved from socialism to the road of capitalist restoration.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fundamentally, is a great revolution to eliminate private ownership concepts and a great revolution to reform souls. What is the essence of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting classes? It is the concept of private ownership. What is the essence of the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat? It is the concept of public ownership. Therefore, the old is old in the "private" character. The new is new in the "public" character. Reforming people's souls and thoughts is to break the old and establish the new, to break private interests and establish public interests.

Is it for private or public interests? This is the fundamental opposition between the worldviews of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

For private interests means always thinking of oneself, only caring for oneself, seeking fame, seeking profit, seeking power, seeking to stand out, forgetting the whole, forgetting society, forgetting the seven hundred million people, forgetting the three billion people of the world. Their minds only have themselves. Their worldview is a "selfish view." They look at the world from the standpoint of "selfish view" and from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie to view everything.

For public interests means not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, completely selfless, dedicated to others, wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. They stand on the standpoint of the proletariat, placing the interests of the revolution, the people, and human liberation above everything.

Chairman Mao's three brilliant works, "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating private interests and establishing public interests, and for reforming people's souls. We must make the "Three Articles" the most fundamental compulsory course for cultivating new communists. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, and Red Guards must seriously and diligently study the "Three Articles," study Mao Zedong Thought, take Comrade Zhang Side and other heroes as examples, and work hard on reforming their worldviews, forging themselves into strong proletarian revolutionary fighters.

### 把“老三篇”作为培养共产主义新人的必修课

    把“老三篇”作为培养共产主义新人的必修课
    现在，全国人民都在热烈响应林彪同志的号召，大学“老三篇”，大用“老三篇”，努力改造思想，在灵魂深处闹革命。
    毛主席在二十二年前写的《为人民服务》一文中指出：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。张思德同志就是我们这个队伍中的一个同志。”
    为了配合学习“老三篇”，本报今天发表了回忆张思德同志的文章，详细地介绍了张思德同志全心全意为人民服务的事迹。
    我们正在从事伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。建设新的社会，要建设新型的人。这种新型的人，就是像张思德、白求恩、雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、焦裕禄，以及32111钻井队的英雄们那样，具有伟大共产主义精神的人。这种人，就是毛主席说的高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离了低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
    几千年来的人类社会，无论是奴隶社会，封建社会，还是资本主义社会，都是建立在私有制基础上的。几千年反动统治阶级的文化，都是为私有制度服务的，为私有观念辩护的。社会主义社会是公有制。要巩固和发展社会主义制度，就必须破除资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。如果不进行意识形态领域里的社会主义革命，让形形色色的私有观念自由泛滥，公有制经济就会瓦解，无产阶级专政就不能巩固，社会主义国家就会改变颜色。在伟大十月革命中诞生的苏联，从社会主义走向资本主义复辟的道路，就是一个极为严重的教训。
    无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是破除私有观念的大革命，改造人的灵魂的大革命。剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的本质是什么？就是私有观念。无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯的本质是什么？就是公有观念。所以，旧，就是旧在一个“私”字上。新，就是新在一个“公”字上。改造人们的灵魂，改造人们的思想，就是要破旧立新，破私立公。
    为私还是为公，是资产阶级和无产阶级的两种根本对立的世界观。
    为私，就是处处想到自己，只顾自己，争名，争利，争权，争出风头，忘了整体，忘了社会，忘了七亿人民，忘了三十亿世界人民。他们脑子里只有自己一口人。他们的世界观，就是“一口观”。他们站在“一口观”上看世界，站在资产阶级立场上看待一切。
    为公，就是不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，毫不利己，专门利人，一心为革命，一心为人民，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务。他们站在无产阶级立场上，把革命的利益，人民的利益，人类解放的利益，看得高于一切。
    毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》三篇光辉著作，是破私立公，改造人们灵魂的强大思想武器。我们一定要把“老三篇”作为培养共产主义新人的最根本的必修课。广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子和红卫兵小将们，都要认真地、刻苦地学习“老三篇”，学习毛泽东思想，以张思德等英雄人物为榜样，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，把自己锻炼成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。
