Chinese experts are warmly welcomed everywhere in Mali. Sometimes, when asked why they treat Chinese experts so well, Malian friends would reply: "Because you are people sent by Mao Zedong, you are our best friends, and we trust you the most."

The sincere friendship of the Malian people towards Chinese experts is beyond words. On the construction site of the sugar factory built with Chinese aid, there is a Malian worker who, to break his habit of spending money freely, would hand over 2,000 Malian francs (equivalent to 20 yuan) to the Chinese experts every month after receiving his salary. Some Malian workers would even come to discuss their parents' wishes for them to get married with the Chinese experts they work with.

The Chinese construction site is a school.

Chinese workers and experts work alongside Malian workers, patiently teaching them various skills. In daily life, they also take care of the Malian workers in every way, fostering a deep friendship between the Malian workers and the Chinese workers and experts.

Once, a Malian worker named Filiketa told a Chinese worker: "At first, my father was worried about me working with the Chinese. He was afraid I would be treated badly, like he was by foreigners in the past. But after I told him how the Chinese comrades patiently helped me learn skills and cared for my safety, he was so moved that he cried. He told me to definitely listen to the Chinese comrades, or he would beat me to death."

Another time, a representative from the Malian Public Works Department, Baba Jiu, told the Chinese experts: "The leadership decided to send me to France to study, but I firmly refused. I said, 'The Chinese construction site is a great school. I can learn more here.'"

Chinese experts are good.

On the construction site of the Malian infrastructure project aided by China, there is a young man named Alasana. Originally a farmer, he was not familiar with technology. However, he was very enthusiastic and worked day and night. The Chinese experts decided to train him to be a crane operator. Since he didn't know the technology, the Chinese experts taught him step by step. They started by letting him practice with an empty crane, then gradually let him lift some light steel structures. He didn't know how to use the clutch, so the Chinese experts held his foot to help him press it. After two or three months, Alasana could operate the crane on his own and was rated as a third-class worker. Once, when he returned home, he told his mother about the situation on the construction site. His mother was very happy and made some small meatballs and local products, telling him to definitely bring them to the Chinese experts to eat.

Many Malian workers, when talking about Chinese experts teaching technology, always give a thumbs up and say they are good. They say, "The Chinese teach everything, holding their hands patiently, and even let them practice with an empty crane. In imperialist factories, after three years of learning, they still only know how to sweep the floor and wipe the table, and haven't learned anything else."

    中马人民心连心
    我们最相信的人
    中国专家在马里到处受到欢迎。有时问起马里朋友为什么对中国专家这样好。马里朋友就回答：“因为你们是毛泽东派来的人，是我们最好的朋友，我们最相信你们。”
    马里人民对中国专家的这种真挚友情是说不完的。中国援建糖厂工地上有个马里工人为了改掉好花钱的习惯，每月发工资后总是拿出二千马里法郎（合人民币二十元）交给中国专家为他保存。有的马里工人连他父母要他结婚的事，也跑来同和他一起工作的专家商量。
    中国工地是学校
    中国工人和专家同马里工人一起劳动，耐心地教会了马里工人各项技术，生活上也处处体贴马里工人，在马里工人与中国工人和专家之间结下了深厚的友谊。
    有一次，马里工人菲利凯塔向一个中国工人说：“开始我爸爸对我到中国人那里工作不放心，怕和他过去一样受外国人的气。等我介绍了中国同志如何耐心帮助我学习技术，如何关心我的安全，爸爸感动的流出眼泪，他要我一定听中国同志的话，否则就要揍死我。”
    还有一次，马里公共工程部代表巴巴究告诉中国专家：领导上决定他去法国学习，他坚决拒绝了。他说：“中国工地就是一个很好的学校，我在这里能够学到更多的东西。”
    中国专家好
    中国援助马里基建工地上，有个小伙子叫阿拉萨那，原来是个农民，不熟悉技术。但是小伙子干劲非常足，做活不分白天黑夜。中国专家决心把他培养成吊车司机。他不会技术，中国专家把着手教。开始让他开空车练，慢慢吊一些轻钢构件。他不会踩离合器，中国专家用手把着他脚踩。经过两三个月，阿拉萨那就能单独操作了，评上了三级工。有次他回家，告诉他妈妈工地的情况，他妈妈听了十分高兴，做了当作珍贵礼品的小丸子和土产，叫他一定要带给中国专家吃。
    不少马里工人提起中国专家教技术，总伸起大拇指称好。他们说，中国人什么都教，把着手耐心教，还让开空车练。在帝国主义工厂，学了三年，还是扫地、擦桌子，什么也没学到。
