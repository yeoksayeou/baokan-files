On the afternoon of May 5, an eight-level wind was blowing over the sea. Cai Qingtan, the deputy director of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Association of the Gu Fu Brigade, was repairing fishing gear by the shore when he noticed two bamboo rafts drifting towards the shore with two fishermen standing on them. As they approached the shore, they were worried because their clothes were soaked by the seawater. It turned out that they were fishermen from Huian. That morning, they had gone out to sea to fish, but encountered strong winds. Their bamboo raft lost control and drifted to the sea near Xiangzhi.

Cai Qingtan remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." He warmly invited the two fishermen back to his home. Upon hearing the news, the community members all rushed over. Some helped them tidy up the bamboo rafts and fishing gear, while others cooked them meals and provided them with dry clothes. In the evening, Cai Qingtan offered his own bed to them, and the deputy secretary of the Youth League, Cai Huaiquan, brought over new quilts. They felt as warm as if they were at home.

The next morning, the wind warning was lifted. The community members helped them find a boat, loaded the bamboo rafts and fishing gear onto it, and sent them back home. As they were about to leave, the Huian fishermen were moved and said, "You are so kind. In the new society, there are relatives everywhere. If we had encountered difficulties here in the old society, who knows what would have happened to us!"

    像生活在家里一样
    五月五日下午，海上刮着八级大风。正在岸边修理渔具的古浮大队贫协副主任蔡清谈，发现海面上漂来两个竹排，上面站着两位渔民；靠岸时，他们因为衣服被海水打湿，正在岸边发愁。原来他们是惠安的渔民，那天早晨出海钓鱼，遇到大风，竹排失去控制能力，漂到祥芝海面来了。
    蔡清谈想起毛主席的教导：一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。他便热情地把两位渔民接回家。社员们一听到这个消息都赶来了。有的帮助他们收拾竹排、整理渔具，有的煮饭给他们吃，拿衣服给他们换。晚上，蔡清谈让出自己的床铺给他们睡，团支部副书记蔡怀川送来了新棉被。他们像生活在自己家里一样温暖。
    第二天清晨，大风警报解除了，社员们又帮助找好了船只，把竹排、渔具等抬到船上，送他们回家。临走时，惠安渔民激动地说：“你们太好了，新社会处处有亲人。要是在旧社会遇难来到这里，不知要落到什么地步！”
