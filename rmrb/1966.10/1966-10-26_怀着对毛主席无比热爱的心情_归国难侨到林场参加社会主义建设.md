The first batch of Indonesian overseas Chinese who suffered persecution and have returned to China have arrived at the Huaqiao Forest Farm in Yangchun County, Guangdong Province, on October 19th and 21st to participate in the socialist construction. They have been properly settled in the forest farm.

With hearts filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, the overseas Chinese have come to the forest farm. At the beginning of their new life, they first expressed their determination to prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works. They are resolved to respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study and apply the "Three Articles" thoroughly, to fundamentally transform their worldview, to promote the revolutionization of their thinking, to actively participate in the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland, and to turn the forest farm into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. With actual actions, they will repay Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's kindness. Some overseas Chinese are full of revolutionary enthusiasm. As soon as they arrived at the forest farm, they voluntarily requested to be assigned work and strive to participate in collective labor as soon as possible.

The majority of the workers at the Huaqiao Forest Farm in Yangchun are Indonesian overseas Chinese who returned to China in 1960. They have shown great concern for their fellow overseas Chinese who are suffering in Indonesia. With the help of the state, they have long been preparing housing, furniture, and daily necessities for the returning overseas Chinese. They have also hung portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and couplets with revolutionary content in every room. When the overseas Chinese arrived at the forest farm, the workers eagerly helped the elderly and children, and made proper arrangements for each household. When the overseas Chinese entered their new homes, they saw the freshly painted rooms, white mosquito nets, and new cotton quilts, and they all expressed their gratitude for Chairman Mao's meticulous care. A 79-year-old overseas Chinese woman happily said, "Chairman Mao sent ships to bring us back to the motherland, and now he has given us new houses and new quilts. Even if I were to die, I would never forget Chairman Mao!"

    怀着对毛主席无比热爱的心情
    归国难侨到林场参加社会主义建设
    据新华社广州二十四日电　到广东省阳春县华侨林场参加社会主义建设的第一批归国的印度尼西亚受害华侨，已经在十九日、二十一日分批到达林场。他们得到了林场的妥善安置。
    难侨们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比热爱的心情来到林场。在开始新的生活时，他们首先表示要把学习毛主席著作放在第一位。他们决心响应林彪同志的号召，学好用好“老三篇”，彻底改造自己的世界观，促进思想的革命化，积极参加祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，把林场办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，以实际行动报答毛主席和共产党的恩情。有的难侨革命热情很高，他们一到林场就主动要求安排工作，争取早日参加集体劳动。
    阳春华侨林场的职工，绝大部分是一九六○年回国的印尼受害华侨，他们对处在水深火热的印尼侨胞，表示极大的关怀。他们在国家的帮助下，早就着手为归国难侨准备好了住房、家具和日常生活用具，并在每间房子里贴上了毛主席像、毛主席语录和革命内容的对联。难侨到达林场时，林场的职工们争着扶老携幼，逐户为他们作了妥善安置。难侨们进入新居时，看到粉刷一新的房子、洁白的蚊帐、新布面的棉被时，都感谢毛主席关怀备至的恩情。一位七十九岁的难侨妇女，高兴得连声说：“毛主席派船接我们回国，如今又给我们住上新房，盖新被，粉身碎骨也忘不了毛主席！”
