New China News Agency, October 7th: La Paz News: The Bolivian Communist Party's organ, Liberation Daily, recently published an article titled "Mao Zedong's Revolutionary Thought," enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao Zedong and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The Contemporary Marxism-Leninism

The article states: Mao Zedong's immeasurable merit is that, during the time of rampant revisionism, he creatively defended the Marxism-Leninism doctrine. Mao Zedong's historical merit is that he elevated Marxism-Leninism to a higher stage of development. After the end of the Second World War, powerful liberation forces emerged in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the international revolutionary movement surged. Mao Zedong not only explained in theory that the broadest masses of people in the world have the right to revolt, but more importantly, he guided their struggles, provided them with strategic weapons, supported them materially, and inspired them spiritually. Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism.

Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers

The article continues: The judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is a Marxism-Leninism judgment. Comrade Mao Zedong used a metaphor to explain this scientific social law: reactionary forces are strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Although imperialism has atomic bombs, it is historically doomed to die, and people of all countries should not be intimidated by the strong appearance of imperialism. The vanguard of the revolution should not be intimidated by its strong appearance. Only by boldly applying this Marxism-Leninism principle can the people of all countries achieve revolutionary victories over American imperialism and its local lackeys.

The article points out that the purpose of the Khrushchev revisionists in opposing this great judgment is to oppose the struggles of the people of all countries and to make the people of all countries submit to nuclear blackmail.

The article says: The people of all countries are understanding and applying the scientific judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Especially for us in this small country that is extremely oppressed by imperialism, we should understand that, in the long run, reactionaries and imperialism are weak, and the truly strong are the people, the peasants, the heroic miners, and the combatant Bolivian working class.

Guns Are the Power

The article, when expounding on Chairman Mao's revolutionary truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," says: Only by correctly applying this scientific revolutionary judgment can the proletariat seize power, and reactionaries and imperialists will fail. The so-called "peaceful road" to seize power adopted by modern revisionists has completely failed. The people of all countries have come to understand through personal experience that the only guarantee of their victory is to resolutely take up the revolutionary guns that can seize proletarian power.

The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind

The article points out that the great historical significance of Chairman Mao's wise judgment of "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" is undeniable. The article says: Only the tricks and wordplay of revisionists will confuse this scientific judgment with "weather" forecasting. The article emphasizes: "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind" means that new forces, proletarian insurgents striving for national liberation, and socialism are gradually dominating world affairs, and the dark forces of reactionaries and imperialism are gradually losing their spheres of influence, narrowing their scope of activity, and falling into the encirclement of the people of all countries. Their doom is approaching.

Class Struggle in the Socialist Period

The article says: Chairman Mao teaches us that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society, and sometimes the class struggle in the ideological realm becomes very sharp. The struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology on the cultural front is an important aspect of the class struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. The article says: The Soviet Union, which experienced the historically significant October Revolution, has slid onto the road of capitalist restoration, providing us with an example that tells us to pay great attention to class struggle and to engage in class struggle with the hidden enemies within the revolution, who raise the banner of "revolution" but engage in activities against socialist construction and the restoration of capitalism.

The article warmly praises the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and points out: The purpose of China's cultural revolution is to adhere to the revolutionary road of building a new society and to avoid taking the revisionist path, because the revisionist path ultimately leads to betraying the communist ideal, meaning the restoration of capitalism.

    玻共《解放报》热烈歌颂毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    毛主席捍卫和发展马列主义的功勋不可估量
    新华社七日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党机关报《解放报》最近发表题为《毛泽东的革命思想》的文章，热情赞扬毛泽东主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    当代的马克思列宁主义
    这篇文章说：毛泽东的不可估量的功勋是，在修正主义泛滥的时候创造性地捍卫了马克思列宁主义学说。毛泽东的历史功勋是把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个更高的发展阶段。第二次世界大战结束以后，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的强大的解放力量出现在第一线，国际革命运动异常高涨。毛泽东不仅在理论上说明了世界上最广大的人民群众造反有理，而且更重要的是指导了他们的斗争，为他们提供了策略武器，在物质上支持了他们，在精神上鼓舞了他们。毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义。
    帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    文章接着说：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断是马克思列宁主义的论断。毛泽东同志用比喻的方法阐明了这个科学的社会规律：反动势力外强中干，帝国主义虽然有原子弹，但是在历史上是不可避免地注定要死亡的，各国人民不应该被帝国主义的强大外表所吓倒，革命的先锋队更不应该被它的强大外表所吓倒。只有大胆地运用这一马克思列宁主义原则，各国人民才能取得对美帝国主义及其在当地的仆从的革命胜利。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者反对这个伟大论断的目的就是反对各国人民的斗争，要各国人民必须屈服于核讹诈。
    文章说：世界各国人民正在领会和运用帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎这个科学论断。特别是受到帝国主义极端奴役的我们这个小国，应该了解到，从长远来看，反动派和帝国主义都是虚弱的，真正强大的是人民，是农民，是英雄的矿工和富有战斗性的玻利维亚工人阶级。
    枪杆子里面出政权
    文章在阐述毛泽东主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的革命真理的时候说：只有正确地运用这个科学的革命论断，无产阶级才能夺取政权，反动派和帝国主义者才会失败。现代修正主义者采取的所谓夺取政权的“和平道路”已经彻底破产。各国人民通过切身体验懂得，他们取得胜利的唯一保证是坚决拿起可以夺取无产阶级政权的革命枪杆子来。
    东风压倒西风
    文章指出，毛泽东主席提出的“东风压倒西风”的英明论断的伟大历史意义是谁也否定不了的。文章说：只有修正主义的阴谋诡计和他们咬文嚼字的理解，才会把这一科学的论断同“气象”预告混为一谈。文章强调说：“东风压倒西风”就是新生力量、争取民族解放的无产阶级起义者和社会主义正在逐步主宰世界大事，就是反动派和帝国主义的黑暗势力正在逐步失掉它们的势力范围、缩小它们的活动范围、陷入各国人民的包围中。它们的末日已经临近。
    社会主义时期的阶级斗争
    文章说：毛泽东主席教导我们，在社会主义社会里还存在阶级和阶级斗争，甚至有些时候，思想意识领域内的阶级斗争变得非常尖锐。文化战线上的灭资兴无的斗争是社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的阶级斗争的一个重要方面。文章说：经历了具有历史意义的十月革命的苏联已经滑到了资本主义复辟的道路上，这给我们提供了一个例子，告诉我们要非常重视阶级斗争，应该同革命内部暗藏的敌人进行阶级斗争，这些暗藏的敌人打着“革命的旗帜”，干的却是反对社会主义建设和复辟资本主义的勾当。
    文章热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且指出：中国进行文化大革命的目的是坚持建设一个新社会的革命道路，避免走上修正主义斜路，因为修正主义斜路最终会导致背叛共产主义理想，意味着资本主义复辟。
