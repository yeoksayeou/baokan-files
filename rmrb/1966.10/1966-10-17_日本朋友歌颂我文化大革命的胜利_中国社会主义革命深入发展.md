The fourth batch of Japanese Socialist Party activists' delegation, upon concluding their visit and leaving China, issued their impressions of their visit to China. With hearts full of excitement, they praised the great leader of world revolution, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, pointing out that Mao Zedong Thought will long and forever play a guiding role in the world revolution.

These Japanese friends, in their conversations, enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and warmly applauded the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Kikuchi Ryuhei said: Through our visit to China, we personally learned that China's Cultural Revolution is fundamentally different from what the Japanese reactionary press has propagated; they are simply spreading lies and slander. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the deepening development of the socialist revolution. It is not easy for a socialist country to eliminate the remnants of the bourgeoisie and advance to communism; this is a serious struggle. Therefore, China must carry out the Cultural Revolution to ensure that New China will never change color. Iizuka Shokichi said: China is carrying out the Cultural Revolution to make Mao Zedong Thought the unified ideology of the entire nation. An important reason why revisionism emerged in the Soviet Union is that they did not carry out a revolution in ideology. China's Cultural Revolution is to plug the loopholes that allow revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. Hane Eichi said, the unprecedented Cultural Revolution has profound significance. Workers, peasants, and soldiers, along with revolutionary intellectuals, are actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, opening a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism.

    日本朋友歌颂我文化大革命的胜利
    中国社会主义革命深入发展
    据新华社讯　第四批日本社会党活动家代表团在结束访问离开中国的时候，发表访华观感。他们怀着激动的心情赞颂世界革命的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指出毛泽东思想将长期地、永远地对世界革命发挥作用。
    这些日本朋友在谈话中热情歌颂中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌胜利，热烈赞扬红卫兵的革命行动好得很。菊地龙平说：通过在中国的访问，我们亲自了解到中国的文化大革命根本不是日本反动报刊所宣传的那样，它们简直是造谣诽谤。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是社会主义革命的深入发展。一个社会主义国家要消灭资产阶级残余而进入共产主义是不容易的，这是一场严重的斗争，所以中国非搞文化大革命不可，这样才能保证新中国永不变颜色。饭冢昭吉说：中国进行文化大革命就是要以毛泽东思想作为全国人民统一的思想。苏联出修正主义很重要的原因就是不搞思想上的革命。中国文化大革命就是堵塞出现修正主义和资本主义复辟的漏洞。羽根荣一说，史无前例的文化大革命意义深远，工农兵群众和革命知识分子活学活用毛泽东思想，开辟了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元。
