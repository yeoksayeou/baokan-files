According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Colombo, Sri Lankan Communist Party Central Committee Politburo Member and Secretariat Secretary Sangamugathasan published an article praising China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as having "epoch-making significance."

Sangamugathasan's article was published in the September 28 issue of the Sri Lankan newspaper *Labour News* (a Sinhala weekly) and the September 27 issue of *Worker's News* (a Tamil weekly). In the article, he pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a revolution that touches the soul of the people. It is a revolution to replace the feudal and bourgeois old ideology, which has existed in China for thousands of years and still persists even after the victory of the socialist revolution, with the proletarian ideology, that is, the ideology of the working class."

He said, "This is a mass movement where 700 million people criticize the old world, the old system of exploitation, and the old customs and habits used by imperialism and the exploiting classes to poison the minds of the working people. This is epoch-making."

He pointed out: "Under the leadership of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese communists correctly believe that the seizure of power by the working class is only the beginning. If serious and effective efforts are not made to transform people's thinking and to thoroughly eradicate the remnants of bourgeois and bad thoughts, the attempt at a bourgeois restoration will succeed. No defeated class will willingly give up its ruling position. It always plots and schemes to stage a comeback."

He said: "The Chinese people know that the reactionaries are pinning their hopes on subverting the next generation. The Chinese are cultivating revolutionary successors. They are making the young people understand that they must never forget the revolutionary traditions and must defend the revolutionary achievements, not only in China but throughout the world, the revolution must be carried through to the end. The Chinese aim is to make the hopes of imperialism come to naught. They are taking full measures to ensure that China does not produce a Khrushchev."

Sangamugathasan pointed out: "Mao Zedong decided to launch the Cultural Revolution at this time is very appropriate."

He said, "Mao Zedong is not just the leader of China. He is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Over the past forty years, he has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism." He emphasized the need to study Mao Zedong's works, and pointed out: "The movement to study Mao Zedong's works is also the movement to study Marxism-Leninism applicable to the era when world imperialism is heading towards its final defeat and world revolution is achieving victory."

    锡共中央政治局委员桑穆加塔桑赞颂我国文化大革命
    七亿人民批判旧世界具有划时代意义
    据新华社科伦坡电  锡兰共产党中央委员会政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑发表文章赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命“具有划时代的意义”。
    桑穆加塔桑的文章刊登在九月二十八日的锡兰《劳工报》（僧伽罗文周刊）和二十七日的《工人报》（泰米尔文周刊）上。他在文章中指出：中国无产阶级文化大革命“是一场触及人们灵魂的革命，是为了根除几千年来在中国存在、甚至在社会主义革命已经取得胜利后还继续存在的封建的、资产阶级的旧意识形态而代之以无产阶级的即工人阶级的意识形态。”
    他说，这是七亿人民都来批判旧世界、旧剥削制度以及帝国主义和剥削阶级用来毒害劳动人民心灵的旧风俗和旧习惯的群众运动。“这是具有划时代意义的。”
    他指出：“中国共产党人，在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的领导下，正确地认为，工人阶级夺取政权只不过是开始。如果不对改造人的思想以及彻底根除资产阶级的旧思想和坏思想残余，进行认真和卓有成效的努力，资产阶级复辟的企图就会得逞。没有一个被打败的阶级会欣然退出掌权的地位。它总是策划和图谋卷土重来。”
    他说：中国人民知道，反动派寄希望于颠覆下一代。中国人正在培养革命接班人。正在使青年人懂得，千万不能忘记革命传统，必须保卫革命成果，不仅在中国，而且在全世界必须把革命进行到底。中国人的目的是要使帝国主义的希望成为泡影。他们正在采取充分措施使中国不出赫鲁晓夫。
    桑穆加塔桑指出：“毛主席决定在这个时候进行文化大革命是很合适的”。
    他说，毛主席“不仅仅是中国的领袖。他是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他在过去四十年间创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。”他强调要学习毛主席著作，并且指出：“学习毛泽东著作的运动也就是学习适用于世界帝国主义走向最后失败和世界革命取得胜利时代的马克思列宁主义的运动。”
