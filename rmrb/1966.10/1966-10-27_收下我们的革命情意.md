Guardians of the Tibet frontier, dear soldiers of the People's Liberation Army:

We are the red guards of the Red Guard Elementary School in Jinan. We were deeply moved by the revolutionary sentiments you expressed in your letter, which was published in the October 12 issue of the People's Daily, showing your boundless love, admiration, and faith in Chairman Mao.

As we read your letter, we all instinctively looked down at the Chairman Mao badges pinned to our chests. Each of us wore a happy smile. We feel fortunate, proud, and honored to have a Chairman Mao badge, allowing us to see Chairman Mao at all times.

Not long ago, just like you, we eagerly awaited the day we could obtain a Chairman Mao badge. Even in our dreams, we yearned for it. Finally, we got it. We were so excited and happy that we jumped and sang, but even a thousand or ten thousand songs could not express our heartfelt admiration for Chairman Mao. We wear it, and it feels as if Chairman Mao is by our side, looking at us affectionately.

We cherish this bright and vivid Chairman Mao badge dearly. However, after reading your letter, we decided to donate our seven precious badges to you. We may not be poets, but our hearts are burning with passion, inspiring us to write a poem, albeit an imperfect one, to send to you.

	The badge on my chest,
	Chairman Mao is by my side.
	His words are deeply ingrained,
	The red sun shines in my heart.
	Chairman Mao points the way to revolution,
	Soldiers bravely march forward.

Dear soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, please accept it. Accept our red hearts. Although Chairman Mao badges are still hard to come by, and millions of people wish to wear them, it doesn't matter. We will find a way to get more. Rest assured, dear soldiers.

That's all we have to say. Even if we say a thousand or ten thousand words, we still cannot express our heartfelt sentiments. Let us, in different places, raise our fists and shout:

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great leader Chairman Mao!

With the highest revolutionary salute from the red guards,
All red guard warriors of the Red Guard Elementary School, Jinan
October 13

    收下我们的革命情意守卫西藏边疆的解放军叔叔们：
    我们是济南市红卫兵小学的红卫兵。读了十月十二日《人民日报》上刊登的信，你们对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰的革命感情深深地感动了我们。
    在读信的时候，我们都不约而同地低下头看看佩戴在自己胸前的毛主席像纪念章，每个人脸上都露出了幸福的笑容。我们都为自己有一枚毛主席像纪念章，时时刻刻能看到毛主席而感到幸福、骄傲和自豪。
    不久以前，我们和你们一样，也是日夜盼望能得到一枚毛主席像纪念章，连做梦也在想，以后终于得到了。我们兴奋、幸福得跳啊，唱啊！唱一千支歌一万支歌也表达不尽我们对毛主席的衷心爱戴。我们戴上了它，看啊，看啊！好像毛主席就在我们身边，亲切地看着我们。
    我们对这枚光灿灿红艳艳的毛主席像纪念章无比热爱，但是，当我们看了你们的信以后，决定把我们仅有的七枚无价之宝赠送给你们。我们不会做诗，一颗颗火热的心鼓舞着我们写了一首不像样的诗，一起送给你们。
    纪念章啊佩胸前，毛主席就在我身边。
    主席话儿牢牢记，最红的太阳照心间。
    毛主席指出革命路，战士奋勇永向前。
    敬爱的解放军叔叔们，收下吧，收下我们的一片红心。眼下，毛主席像纪念章虽然仍不容易得到，千千万万人都想快点在胸前戴上它，但是不要紧，我们会想办法再得到的。放心吧，叔叔们。
    信就写到这里吧！真是说千句话万句话，也说不尽我们内心的知心话。让我们在不同的地方振臂高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
          致以崇高的红卫兵的革命敬礼！
            济南市红卫兵小学全体红卫兵战士
                                        十月十三日
