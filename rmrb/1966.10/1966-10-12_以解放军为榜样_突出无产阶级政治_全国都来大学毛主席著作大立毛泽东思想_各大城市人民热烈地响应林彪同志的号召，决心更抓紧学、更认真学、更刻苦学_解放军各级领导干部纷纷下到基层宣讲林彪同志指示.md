The call by Comrade Lin Biao to elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level has been enthusiastically responded to by revolutionary masses across the country. People have pointed out that Comrade Lin Biao's call reflects the aspirations of hundreds of millions of people and is a great encouragement to the entire nation. Workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres in major cities have held discussions. They have vowed to closely follow the PLA, learn better from the PLA, and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. They will further intensify the study of Chairman Mao's works, emphasize practical application, and thoroughly spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the nation, making it the unified action guideline for the entire people.

Some workers at the Beijing Thermal Power Plant said that Comrade Lin Biao's call is like a timely rain on the ideological front. We workers enthusiastically support it and will definitely master Mao Zedong Thought and apply it in actual struggles, making it truly play the role of a spiritual atomic bomb. Young worker Wang Yide from the plant said: We can go without food, but we cannot go without studying Chairman Mao's works. We will study for the revolution, use it for the revolution, study it for a lifetime, use it for a lifetime, and dedicate our lives to the revolution. Many members and cadres of Dongwei Commune and Dongsheng Commune in the suburbs of Beijing held discussions in the fields. The chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Sun Shiying from Hongguang Brigade, said: We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call. We must truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, imprint it in our minds, and spread it to every corner, turning the countryside into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought. Some Red Guards from Beijing No. 2 Middle School said: We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call. We will definitely hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and become good successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Comrade Lin Biao's call has stirred up an extremely strong response among the thousands and thousands of revolutionary masses in Shanghai. People have held discussions and repeatedly studied and seriously understood the spirit of Comrade Lin Biao's call. Many people also wrote big-character posters and made plans, determined to immediately implement Comrade Lin Biao's call in practice. Workers from Shanghai Quxin Shipyard, who have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works for eight years, said: We will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, treating Mao Zedong Thought as our first life and studying Chairman Mao's works as our lifelong first need. In nine lectures at Shanghai Garment Factory, many workers shared their experiences from studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and based on the spirit of Comrade Lin Biao's call, they identified gaps in their study of Chairman Mao's works. More than 2,500 workers unanimously expressed that they will definitely and thoroughly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study Chairman Mao's works more seriously and intensively, and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice. In the suburbs of Shanghai, many commune members also held discussions, saying that agricultural production has countless details, but the most fundamental and core aspect is to emphasize the education of Mao Zedong Thought.

Workers in Shenyang said that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are a new mobilization order to the nation. We must strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, resist bourgeois ideology, accelerate ideological revolutionization, and especially draw strength from "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." When facing difficulties, think of Yu Gong; when having selfish thoughts, think of Zhang Side; in work, strive for excellence like Norman Bethune.

In Guangzhou, workers from the national model enterprise Guangzhong Iron Oxide Factory and Guangzhong Battery Factory expressed in discussions that they will treat Mao Zedong Thought as the unified ideology and action guideline for the entire factory, learning a bit and applying a bit, repeatedly learning and applying, and thoroughly implementing it.

At the Xi'an Electric Capacitor Factory, active learners of Chairman Mao's works held a discussion, unanimously expressing that they will elevate the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, especially by first studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," doing so daily and repeatedly. Farmers in the suburbs of Xi'an said that after reading Chairman Mao's books, they have clear minds and bright eyes, red hearts, and strong bones. We poor and lower-middle peasants will deeply plant this shining seed of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

Representatives attending the ongoing conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works from Wuhan's agricultural front said that as long as they follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works will definitely have new and greater developments. National People's Congress representative and worker engineer Ma Xili from Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory said: Without Chairman Mao's thoughts, one cannot take a single step. I will definitely follow Comrade Lin Biao's words, seriously study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and reform my worldview for a lifetime, playing an active leading role in the new stage of the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works.

In Tianjin, workers used their rest time to study or hold discussions, saying that revolution cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's books must be read daily, studied, and applied, and then studied again. Active learner of Chairman Mao's works and maintenance worker Li Mulin from Tianjin Engineering Machinery Factory has been continuously studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" for several years, striving to establish a revolutionary worldview. He expressed that he will continue to follow Comrade Lin Biao's words, definitely treating these three articles as his motto, studying and applying them for a lifetime.

Part of the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants' association chairmen from the advanced agricultural production unit, Dazhai-style Qingmengkou Brigade in the suburbs of Chengdu, held discussions during their labor rest time. Brigade leader Zhu Haicheng said that they will immediately organize all commune members to study Comrade Lin Biao's call, making the study of Chairman Mao's works more practical, and creating a new situation. A Yi ethnic student from the Southwest Nationalities Institute, Jin Liqiu, who came from a slave background, said that Chairman Mao's books are the revolutionary compass and the lifeline of millions of slaves. Comrade Lin Biao's great call further points out the direction for us to study Chairman Mao's works.

Many leading cadres of the People's Liberation Army, with high political enthusiasm and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have led work teams to deeply enter companies, ships, airports, warehouses, hospitals, and border outposts. They have propagated Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the broad masses of grassroots cadres and soldiers, ensuring that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are quickly transmitted, known to everyone, and deeply rooted in people's hearts. A grand activity of propagating and studying Comrade Lin Biao's instructions has been extensively carried out throughout the army.

Many army leading cadres, with the spirit of "teachers must first be students," first studied and discussed these instructions with the office cadres, and then led the office cadres to the companies for propaganda. After the Engineering Corps Party Committee members concentrated on studying, some went to the construction companies and farms for propaganda. The leading cadres of a certain torpedo ship fleet in the Navy, except for a few who remained to handle daily work, all went to the ships and studied the instructions with the sailors, propagating the instructions. The Railway Corps, which is in the midst of intense construction, dispatched most of the division and regiment leading cadres to thirty work points. Since the companies are dispersed, they adopted the method of propagating to one class at a time, or to a few people at a time. The leading cadres of a certain regiment in the Guangzhou Military Region, carrying their luggage, lived with the soldiers after arriving at the companies, ate with them, labored with them, studied with them, and always propagated Comrade Lin Biao's instructions in an ordinary soldier's posture. The leading cadres of a certain artillery division in the Wuhan Military Region, when propagating to soldiers, workers, and family members, also wrote important passages from Comrade Lin Biao's instructions into leaflets and slogans, posting them inside and outside the camp area, ensuring that Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are seen by everyone, heard by everyone, remembered by everyone, and implemented in action.

The leading cadres' deep entry into the grassroots for propaganda of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers. The soldiers said: Comrade Lin Biao's instructions are the timely rain that promotes us to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the mobilization order that urges us to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. We have listened to broadcasts again and again, read documents and newspapers again and again, and we are never tired of listening or reading. The leading comrades' repeated propaganda to us makes us understand more deeply and study more vigorously. After the leading comrades of a certain army propagated Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to the "Model Red Ninth Company" that studies Chairman Mao's works, the soldiers of this company said: Comrade Lin Biao's instructions make our hearts brighter and our horizons broader. We must keep up with the new situation of the entire party, army, and nation studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, never be complacent, always maintain forward momentum, definitely master Mao Zedong Thought, definitely make the Red Ninth Company, this grand school of Mao Zedong Thought, better and better, implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, and let our most beloved leader Chairman Mao always be at ease. When the leading cadres of a certain unit in the Chengdu Military Region propagated Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, they held a grand meeting. The soldiers, after listening to Comrade Lin Biao's precious instructions and receiving Chairman Mao's precious book "Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Revised Soldier's Edition)," all happily said: Today is a double blessing. Leading cadres from the Air Force, Lanzhou, Beijing, Nanjing, Jinan, Kunming, Fuzhou, Armored Forces, and the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet Military Regions, after propagating to the companies, the soldiers unanimously expressed that they will definitely master Mao Zedong Thought and follow Chairman Mao in making a lifetime of revolution in great winds and waves.

Comrade Lin Biao's instructions have reached the southwestern border of the motherland. The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed here are all rejoiced and inspired. A soldier from a certain unit in the Kunming Military Region is reading Comrade Lin Biao's instructions.
