I am a high school graduate who used to be an elementary school teacher. I thought: even if I don't sit in an office in the army, I should still learn some skills. Who would have thought that upon joining the army, I was assigned to feed pigs, which really didn't sit well with me. Since I wasn't committed to the work, I didn't take care of the pigs properly. The company had several dozen pigs, and after a month of my care, the fat pigs became thin. The company commander noticed this problem and helped me from various angles, urging me to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" thoroughly. Because I adopted a superficial approach to learning, focusing on symptoms rather than root causes, my individualistic thoughts would resurface whenever conditions were right.

One day, while carrying pig feed to feed the pigs, a group of children called me "pig keeper" to my face. I was very upset. I thought, at home, students would salute me and greet me as "teacher." Now, I've become a "pig keeper." I went to find the political instructor in a bad mood. The political instructor said, "Little Li, we study Chairman Mao's works to transform our thoughts, not to patch up problems like a cobbler. Chairman Mao said, 'The transformation of one's worldview is a fundamental transformation.' Thought reform must focus on the root, which is a key battlefield on the ideological front. If we are to work hard on 'using,' we must work hard on transforming our worldview."

Under the guidance of the political instructor, I repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and Chairman Mao's relevant instructions with my own problems in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is a people's army. It fights for the liberation of the people and serves the people wholeheartedly." He also said, "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people." Studying Chairman Mao's teachings made me feel close to him, but also ashamed of myself. I felt close because Chairman Mao's words encouraged me to do a good job in the revolution, and I felt ashamed because I had not followed Chairman Mao's instructions.

Once my thoughts were clear, my work became more dedicated. Although feeding pigs is hard work, I saw it as a battlefield for tempering and transforming myself. When faced with difficulties, I would think of Comrade Zhang Side's attitude towards work; when my thoughts wavered, I would use Chairman Mao's teachings to spur myself on.

Through this process, I deeply felt that studying Chairman Mao's works cannot be superficial; one must delve deep, grasp the root of one's thoughts, and persistently "copy the 'I' character's home" to achieve victory in ideological struggles.

    抄“我”字的老家
    五好战士、饲养员　李志论
    我是个高中生，入伍前当小学教员。我想：到部队不坐办公室，也得学点技术。谁知到部队后，让我去喂猪，心里真不是滋味。工作一不安心，喂猪也不在意。连里几十头猪，我喂了一个来月，肥猪变成瘦猪。连首长发现这个问题，就从多方面帮助我，叫我好好学习《为人民服务》。由于我学习上采取了头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法，没有刨到思想根上，所以，个人主义思想一遇到气候就窜了出来。
    一天，我挑着猪饲料去喂猪，一帮小孩子当着面叫我“小猪倌”，我一听就很恼火。心想，在家教学，小学生见了我先敬礼，后问声“老师好”。现在可倒好，成了“小猪倌”。我满肚子不高兴地去找指导员。指导员说：“小李呀，咱们学习毛主席著作，是为了改造思想，可不能像修鞋匠那样，哪里破了补哪里。毛主席说过，‘世界观的转变是一个根本的转变’。思想改造就要抓这个根，这是思想战线上的一个核心阵地。在‘用’字上狠下功夫，就应该在改造世界观上狠下功夫。”
    在指导员的帮助下，我带着自己的问题，反复学习了《为人民服务》和毛主席的有关指示。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”又说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。学了毛主席的教导，感到很亲切，同时自己也很惭愧。亲切的是毛主席的话句句都是鼓励自己干好革命，惭愧的是自己没有按毛主席的指示去做。
    思想通了，工作也就安心了。喂猪工作虽然累，但我把它看成是锻炼、改造自己的战场。遇到困难，我就想想张思德同志对待工作的态度；思想有了波动，就用毛主席的教导来鞭策自己。
    通过这一段过程，我深深地体会到：学习毛主席著作，不能在外围敲“边鼓”，必须打纵深仗，揪住思想根子不放，穷抄“我”字的老家，才能在思想斗争中取得胜利。
