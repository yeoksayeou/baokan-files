A Hungarian construction worker asked a Chinese comrade for a portrait of Chairman Mao. When the Chinese comrade fulfilled his request, he carefully put away Chairman Mao's portrait. A friend, because he did not have a portrait of Chairman Mao, used a camera to copy Chairman Mao's portrait from someone else's magazine and kept it as a memento.

    珍爱毛主席的像片
    一位匈牙利建筑工人向中国同志要一张毛主席的像片，当中国同志满足了他的要求时，他把毛主席的像片小心地收藏起来。有一位朋友因为自己没有毛主席像片，就从别人的画报上用照像机把毛主席的像片翻拍下来，留作纪念。
