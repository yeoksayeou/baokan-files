China's agricultural machinery industry has achieved its greatest development this year. The purchase of agricultural machinery by collective economies has exceeded that of any previous year; the output value of local agricultural machinery industry has accounted for more than two-thirds of the total output value of the agricultural machinery industry; and the variety of small agricultural machinery is increasing.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on October 17, the broad masses of workers on the agricultural machinery industry frontline are resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's directive on agricultural mechanization, which emphasizes that the development of agricultural mechanization should prioritize collective economies, the development of the agricultural machinery industry should prioritize local industries, and the development of agricultural machinery products should prioritize small-scale machinery. They are striving to accelerate the development of agricultural mechanization.

This year has been the fastest year of development for the agricultural machinery industry since the founding of New China. Currently, the proportion of agricultural machinery purchased by collective economies is increasing, the development of local agricultural machinery industry is accelerating, and the variety of small agricultural machinery is expanding. China's agricultural mechanization is entering a new stage.

This year, the broad masses of workers on the agricultural machinery industry frontline have repeatedly and thoroughly studied Chairman Mao's directive on accelerating agricultural mechanization. They deeply understand that gradually realizing agricultural mechanization and electrification on the basis of collectivization is Chairman Mao's consistent great strategic thought, the strong desire of the Chinese people for a long time, the only correct path for developing China's agricultural production, and a major matter related to preparedness against war, natural disasters, and the people. Therefore, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have used revolution as a powerful driving force to produce agricultural machinery in every possible way, supporting the development of agricultural mechanization in various places.

With the development and consolidation of the collective economy of people's communes, the purchasing power of the collective economy is continuously increasing. This year, people's communes and production brigades across the country have purchased agricultural machinery with collective economic accumulation, with the quantity and variety exceeding that of any previous year. The collective economy can not only purchase semi-mechanized agricultural tools for irrigation, agricultural and sideline product processing, transportation, plant protection, and tillage, but also large and medium-sized agricultural machinery such as tractors and mechanical and electrical drainage power. This year, more than 80% of the drainage machinery produced nationwide was purchased by the collective economy. In Guangdong Province, more than 80% of the tractors allocated by the state were also purchased by the collective economy. Various people's communes across the country urgently need a large number of semi-mechanized agricultural tools to strengthen their ability to resist natural disasters and achieve a bumper harvest. Just in the eight northern provinces, the collective economy purchased more than 1.35 million hand-pushed rubber-wheeled carts this year. Many people's communes and production brigades that have consistently insisted on self-reliance and relied on the collective economy to achieve agricultural mechanization, such as Jinxing Brigade in Xiaogan County, Hubei, Liuji Commune in Xinzhou County, and Jiajiadun Brigade in Fenyang County, Shanxi, have all increased their agricultural machinery this year, entirely funded by the collective economy, without spending a single cent from the state.

With the deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the movement to study Chairman Mao's works has reached a new high tide on the agricultural machinery industry frontline. Many agricultural machinery factories have formed a daily, all-people, and all-things learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. After repeatedly studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," the broad masses of workers have further understood the great political significance of supporting agriculture, determined to overcome all difficulties, and strive to complete production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them. From January to September this year, the production of major agricultural machinery products nationwide has increased significantly, with the production of hand-held tractors more than doubling compared to the same period last year, internal combustion engines increasing by 62%, and sprayers and dusters increasing by 46%.

These facts vividly prove that by learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the workers, spiritual strength can be transformed into tremendous material strength. These agricultural machinery products, when supplied to rural areas in a timely manner, have played a significant role in promoting agricultural increase and income and relying on the collective economy to develop agricultural mechanization.

Local agricultural machinery industry is the main force of China's agricultural machinery industry. Currently, all semi-mechanized and mechanized agricultural tools and power machinery below 20 horsepower are produced by local industries. The output value of local agricultural machinery industry accounts for more than two-thirds of the total output value of the agricultural machinery industry. Since this year, Chairman Mao's great call to accelerate agricultural mechanization has inspired the broad masses of workers in the agricultural machinery industry nationwide, promoting the unprecedented development and improvement of local agricultural machinery industry, and making increasingly greater contributions to supporting agricultural production and promoting agricultural mechanization.

China's vast territory, diverse crop varieties, and varied farming systems require simple-structured, easy-to-operate, small, flexible, and multi-purpose small agricultural machinery. Aiming at the actual needs of rural areas, the broad masses of scientific and technological personnel in the agricultural machinery department have, during the Cultural Revolution, criticized bourgeois ideology and bourgeois academic "authorities," broken down foreign frameworks and doctrines, and, with practical actions, gone down to the countryside, based on the farmers' tool reforms, and implemented the combination of workers, cadres, and technicians with farmers as the main body. They have designed many small, flexible new products, such as small tractors, hand-held tractors, small mobile sprayers, high-lift water pumps, and diesel and gasoline engines below 10 horsepower. These new products are inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible, and are warmly welcomed by farmers. The production of power machinery below 10 horsepower this year has increased by more than 60% compared to last year. Various semi-mechanized agricultural tools and simple-structured, labor-saving, and convenient-to-tow machinery-driven agricultural tools are also increasing. The large-scale production and supply of small agricultural machinery have greatly promoted agricultural production and opened up new avenues for people's communes in rural areas to develop sideline production and implement diversified operations.

Currently, the broad masses of workers on the agricultural machinery industry frontline are further emphasizing proletarian politics, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, achieving the thought revolution of people, and determining to turn all agricultural machinery stations, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants, and repair plants into schools of Mao Zedong Thought, contributing to the acceleration of China's agricultural mechanization.

    贯彻执行毛主席关于加速实现农业机械化的伟大指示
    我国农业机械工业今年获得最大发展
    集体经济购买的农业机械超过以往任何一年；地方农机工业产值已占农机工业总产值的三分之二以上；小型农业机械品种越来越多。
    据新华社十七日讯　我国农业机械工业战线广大职工坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席提出的农业机械化的发展要以集体经济为主，农机工业的发展要以地方工业为主，农机产品的发展要以小型为主的方针，大力加速农业机械化事业的发展。
    今年是新中国成立以来农业机械工业发展最快的一年。现在，集体经济购买农业机械的比例越来越大，地方农机工业的发展越来越快，小型农业机械的品种越来越多，我国农业机械化事业开始进入了一个新的阶段。
    今年农机工业战线广大职工认真地反复地学习了毛主席关于加速实现农业机械化的指示，他们深刻地认识到在集体化的基础上，逐步实现农业的机械化和电气化，是毛主席一贯的伟大战略思想，是全国人民长期以来的强烈愿望，是发展我国农业生产的唯一正确道路，是关系到备战、备荒、为人民的大事。因此，他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，以革命为强大动力，千方百计增产农业机械，支援各地农业机械化事业的发展。
    随着人民公社集体经济的发展和巩固，集体经济的购买力不断提高。今年全国各地人民公社和生产队，用集体经济积累购买的农业机械，数量之大，品种之多，超过了以往任何一年。集体经济不但能够购买提水、农副产品加工、运输、植物保护、耕作等各种半机械化农具，而且能够购买拖拉机、机电排灌动力等大、中型农业机械。今年全国生产的排灌机械百分之八十以上是由集体经济购买的。广东省今年国家分配的拖拉机，也有百分之八十以上是由集体经济购买的。各地人民公社为了加强抗拒自然灾害的能力，夺取农业大丰收，迫切要求供应大量半机械化农具。单是我国北方八省，今年集体经济购买的手推胶轮车就有一百三十五万多辆。许多一贯坚持自力更生，依靠集体经济办农业机械化的人民公社、生产队，像湖北孝感县的金星大队，新洲县的刘集公社，山西汾阳县的贾家庄大队等，今年新增的农业机械，全部都是集体经济投资，没有花国家一个钱。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，农机工业战线广大职工学习毛主席著作的运动进入了一个新高潮。许多农机工厂已经形成天天学、人人学、事事学的活学活用毛主席著作的风气。广大职工反复学习了“老三篇”以后，进一步认识到支援农业的重大政治意义，下定决心，排除万难，千方百计提前超额完成生产任务。今年一到九月，全国主要农机产品的产量大幅度增长，其中手扶拖拉机的产量比去年同期增长两倍多，内燃机增长百分之六十二，喷雾、喷粉器增长百分之四十六。
    这些事实雄辩地证明，通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想灌输到工人中去，就能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。这些农机产品及时供应农村以后，对促进农业增产增收和依靠集体经济发展农业机械化事业，都起了很大的作用。
    地方农机工业是我国农机工业的主要力量。现在，我国全部半机械化、机械化农具和二十马力以下的动力机械，都是依靠地方工业生产的。地方农机工业的产值已占农机工业总产值的三分之二以上。今年以来，毛主席关于加速实现农业机械化这一战略任务的伟大号召，鼓舞着全国农机工业广大职工，推动地方农机工业得到了空前的发展和提高，在支援农业生产、促进农业机械化事业中作出了越来越大的贡献。
    我国地区辽阔，农作物品种繁多，耕作制度千差万别，许多地区需要结构简单、操作方便、小巧灵活又能综合利用的小型农业机械。针对广大农村的实际需要，农机部门广大科学技术人员在文化大革命中一面批判资产阶级思想，批判资产阶级反动的学术
  “权威”，大破洋框框、洋教条，一面以实际行动，下楼出院，上山下乡，在农民群众农具改革的基础上，实行以工农为主体的工人、领导干部和技术人员三结合，设计了许多小巧灵活的新产品，如小型拖拉机、手扶拖拉机、小型机动喷雾器、高扬程水泵以及十马力以下的柴油机、汽油机等。这些新产品价廉物美，轻巧灵活，受到农民的热烈欢迎。今年已生产出来的十马力以下的动力机械的产量，比去年增长百分之六十以上。各种半机械化农具和结构简单、省工省料、拖带方便的机引农具也越来越多。小型农业机械的大量生产供应，大大促进了农业生产，也为农村人民公社发展副业生产，实行多种经营开辟了新的途径。
    目前，农业机械工业战线广大职工，正进一步突出无产阶级政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，决心把所有农业机械站、农业机械制造厂和修理厂，都办成毛泽东思想大学校，为加速实现我国农业机械化贡献力量。（附图片）
